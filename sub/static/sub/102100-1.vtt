Uh, thank you, Jessica.
Very inappropriate.

01:23.431 --> 01:24.432
Okay.

01:24.519 --> 01:25.824
I'm so juiced.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.652
This is gonna be fire.

01:29.872 --> 01:31.482
I don't know
what that means.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.980
-Good morning,
Mr. Thompson.
-Hi, Maddy.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.183
Hey, Wings,
will you give us a--

02:20.270 --> 02:23.534
Oh, never mind,

-Yeah, get me
out of here.

All right!

for the O.C.N.?

-Oh, man.
-What's up,
my old phony?

So, is it a rock-paper-scissors
thing or...

04:01.632 --> 04:04.200
Sorry, Maddy.
It's top-secret.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.594
Only the receptive
shall receive.

04:06.681 --> 04:07.943
That doesn't mean anything.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.336
You don't mean anything.

04:09.423 --> 04:10.815
[chuckling]
I'm just kidding.

04:10.902 --> 04:13.035
So, are you guys
ready for California?

04:13.122 --> 04:15.516
I hear they got beaches.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.039
Muscle beaches.

04:17.126 --> 04:18.258
I'm just looking forward
to meeting

04:18.345 --> 04:20.129
some California girls.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.305
Not to mention
the international beauties.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.393
Are you planning
to woo them

04:23.480 --> 04:25.177
with your stupid
friendship song?

04:25.265 --> 04:28.703
Hey... you don't talk
about the friendship song.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.661
-Friendship song
is iced shit.
-Mm-hmm.

04:30.748 --> 04:33.273
One day, you will
tell me what it means.

You guys looking forward
to the Music Exchange?

04:34.970 --> 04:35.927
Hell, yeah.

04:36.014 --> 04:37.233
What's that?

04:37.320 --> 04:38.930
Mr. T explained it
at rehearsal.

04:39.017 --> 04:40.802
Oh? Yeah,
I wasn't listening.

04:40.889 --> 04:42.194
It's where we sit with
an international band,

04:42.282 --> 04:43.674
and we play
each other's music.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.459
-Ohh...
-And...

04:45.546 --> 04:47.461
you may not speak
the same language...

04:47.548 --> 04:49.332
-Uh-huh.
-But you communicate

04:49.419 --> 04:50.507
through eye contact.

04:50.594 --> 04:51.769
-Uh-huh.
-[laughs]

04:51.856 --> 04:54.076
-And the sensual
sound of song.
-Yeah.

04:54.163 --> 04:57.471
Maybe I'll get to share keys
with a hot Brazilian,

Bet you wish that
was your cheek slathered
in saliva, don't you?

06:02.971 --> 06:05.321
-Shut up.
-I can go get
you a sample.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.192
You realize you don't
stand a chance, right?

06:07.279 --> 06:09.934
Unless you, I don't know,
talked to her?

06:10.021 --> 06:11.675
-[laughs] "Talked."
-"Talked."

06:11.762 --> 06:13.329
[both laughing]
"To her"!

It's not that hard.

I like books. What is female?"

-God.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.384
Good morning, Richard.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.037
Ready for your...
first band trip?

06:26.124 --> 06:28.562
Ohh, yes, sir.
I'm looking forward to it.

06:28.649 --> 06:31.260
Good. Good.
You'll do... fine.

06:32.348 --> 06:36.091
Now, I am obligated
to ask you

06:36.178 --> 06:38.267
because of some
unsettling events

06:38.354 --> 06:40.356
that have just
come to light, heh--

06:40.443 --> 06:43.272
Not with you!
Not... here, of course.

06:43.359 --> 06:45.230
Elsewhere.

06:45.317 --> 06:49.147
The PTA asked me to ask
that you--

06:49.234 --> 06:51.585
not just you,
all the faculty--

06:51.672 --> 06:53.674
not, um...

06:53.761 --> 06:56.024
and that is not to say
that we think that you would...

06:57.591 --> 06:59.854
We don't enjoy making
people feel uncomfortable.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.464
No. Not at all.
Please.

07:01.551 --> 07:02.944
Well, you know,

07:03.031 --> 07:06.034
I hate to be so specific,
but the PTA...

07:06.121 --> 07:07.775
You know, they
really demand directness

07:07.862 --> 07:09.733
with this sort of thing.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.474
Well, yeah,
you have to be direct.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.520
Mm, yes.
Better to say something

07:13.607 --> 07:15.217
than leave it unsaid.

07:16.348 --> 07:17.654
So I'll say it.

07:21.049 --> 07:24.487
The PTA has asked me
to ask you

07:24.574 --> 07:29.405
not to, uh,
do anything,

07:29.492 --> 07:32.147
you know...
with the, uh...

07:34.802 --> 07:36.281
You know.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.935
-Oh, God.
-I know! I know..

07:38.022 --> 07:40.677
You would never
do somethin' so heinous.

07:40.764 --> 07:42.549
But they feel
we should be blunt

07:42.636 --> 07:43.941
when it comes to matters
like this.

07:44.028 --> 07:45.595
-Unsettling as they may be.
-Of course.

07:45.682 --> 07:48.468
And I appreciate
your being so direct.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.382
But let me be clear
that I would never--

07:50.470 --> 07:52.167
No doubt.
No doubt.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.995
We have the utmost
confidence in you.

07:54.082 --> 07:56.214
After all, you turned around
the music department.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.914
Everyone loves you!
The-- the parents,

08:00.001 --> 08:02.307
the kids.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.353
We just ask
that you don't...

08:04.440 --> 08:06.050
Of course.
No. And thank you.

08:06.137 --> 08:07.356
I just-- let me assure you
that I would never--

08:07.443 --> 08:09.793
No assurance needed.
I assured you!

08:09.880 --> 08:11.229
[chuckling]

08:11.316 --> 08:13.362
It's just that California's
a coastal state,

08:13.449 --> 08:15.059
and many find it
bewitching.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.017
You understand.

08:16.104 --> 08:17.975
[sighs]
Yes. Yes.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.457
Anyway, glad we could
have this frank talk.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.024
Yes! Me, too.

08:23.111 --> 08:26.288
-You won't, uh...
-No! Definitely not.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.072
Pinky swear.

08:29.421 --> 08:32.033
Good! Well, you...

08:32.120 --> 08:33.817
better get a move on.

08:33.904 --> 08:34.949
Have fun!

08:36.037 --> 08:37.168
But not too much fun!

Yes! I exist.

Uh, fortunately.

banish you

does everybody have

10:01.862 --> 10:03.646
everything they need
for this trip?

Because once
we hit the freeway,

there's no comin' back,
that's it.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.943
Mind if I sit here?

12:07.030 --> 12:10.251
Uh...
[stammers] Uh, yeah.

12:10.338 --> 12:11.382
No, go ahead.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.517
What are you
looking for?

12:15.604 --> 12:17.911
-Huh?
-Your book?

12:17.998 --> 12:21.828
Oh! Yeah, it was--
it was at the gas station.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.526
Um, it tells you
places to visit

12:24.613 --> 12:28.530
based on what you're...
looking for.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.271
What are you looking for?

12:31.838 --> 12:34.928
Uh, I-I have--
I haven't traveled much.

12:35.015 --> 12:37.017
[stammering]

12:37.104 --> 12:39.062
I just got the book.

12:39.149 --> 12:42.587
What--
What are you into?

12:42.674 --> 12:48.071
Oh, you know, different stuff.
Art, jazz... history.

12:48.158 --> 12:50.639
Really? You? I--

12:50.726 --> 12:53.033
I-I mean, me too.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.209
Wh-What kind
of history do you like?

12:55.296 --> 12:56.688
Sexual history.

12:56.776 --> 12:57.777
What?

12:57.864 --> 12:59.561
You know, procreation,

12:59.648 --> 13:01.693
our biological
and cultural frameworks.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.608
How they've changed
over the millennia.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.045
Evolution wouldn't work

13:05.132 --> 13:06.916
if we weren't hardwired
to enjoy sex.

13:07.003 --> 13:09.310
So, pleasure
is not only natural,

13:09.397 --> 13:10.311
it's essential.

13:10.398 --> 13:11.355
Isn't that neat?

13:12.661 --> 13:15.533
Um... [stammering]
Definitely, yeah.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.362
[scoffs]
Procreation is the best.

13:20.060 --> 13:23.977
Uh, you must have...
fun homework.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.108
Can I sleep with you?

13:25.195 --> 13:26.631
What?

13:26.718 --> 13:29.591
The big doofus up there
keeps falling on me.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.071
Don't make me go back.

13:31.158 --> 13:34.074
Oh, and your shoulder
is so comfortable.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.859
Uh... yeah.
No problem.

13:36.946 --> 13:39.427
Be mine... guest.

13:39.514 --> 13:40.645
Thanks.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.474
Your girlfriend
won't mind?

13:43.561 --> 13:44.693
What, Maddy?

13:44.780 --> 13:47.217
Oh... no,
we're not friends.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.567
We're-- We're just friends.

13:49.654 --> 13:52.701
Good. I wouldn't want
to steal you from anyone.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.398
Just borrow you.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.533
Mmm. You smell nice.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.536
You don't mind?

14:01.623 --> 14:05.757
Um... what a--
what about your girlfriend?

14:05.845 --> 14:09.849
Wings? Oh, we're
not really together.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.981
I'm not even sure
if he likes me anymore.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.860
What are you doing?

14:20.947 --> 14:21.904
[whispering]
Homework.

14:23.819 --> 14:25.734
-Are you crazy?
-Shh.

14:25.821 --> 14:27.605
No one has to know.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.564
We can do it quietly.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.827
Just don't wake up...

14:31.914 --> 14:33.655
-[gasping]
-[gasps]

14:33.742 --> 14:35.962
[panting]

14:39.008 --> 14:40.183
[sighs]

14:43.056 --> 14:44.753
-You okay?
-Huh?

14:44.840 --> 14:46.581
[sighs]

14:46.668 --> 14:47.843
It was a--
a ba--

14:49.801 --> 14:51.281
Muscle cramp.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.545
[gasps]

14:54.632 --> 14:56.678
[laughing]

14:56.765 --> 14:58.332
Maddy: Muscle cramp, huh?

14:58.419 --> 15:00.116
Well, only one way
to fix that.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.813
Don't... say it.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.728
[giggling]

15:03.815 --> 15:04.991
Don't say it.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.603
[loud clatter,
tires screeching]

15:08.690 --> 15:10.083
[students shrieking]

15:10.170 --> 15:11.823
-Boy: Yo... what--
-Girl: What was that?

15:11.911 --> 15:12.694
Boy 2: What's going on?

15:12.781 --> 15:14.261
[tires screeching]

15:14.348 --> 15:15.740
Shit.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.309
[engine dying]

15:21.311 --> 15:22.399
It wasn't me.

15:23.661 --> 15:26.664
[light jazz music]

16:01.177 --> 16:03.266
I've been in worse.

16:03.353 --> 16:04.398
Who wants to share a bed?

16:04.485 --> 16:06.878
[door squeaks, closes]

16:06.966 --> 16:10.317
Wings:
All right, this one's mine.

16:10.404 --> 16:12.797
You guys can have that thing.

16:12.884 --> 16:14.843
[grunts]

16:25.680 --> 16:26.898
Wanna sleep ass to mouth?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.639
You mean head to toe?

16:28.726 --> 16:30.772
-Yeah.
-No.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.964
It sucks, we should be
at the ocean right now.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.836
At least the water's clear.
[sink sprays]

16:51.923 --> 16:53.882
No hair in the shower.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.884
Smells like ham sandwiches.

16:55.971 --> 16:58.321
-Sheets are clean.
-Yeah, but what is this?

16:58.408 --> 17:01.585
-Is this blood?
-Oh, my God.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.544
I can't tell.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.633
Why does it always look dark
in these places?

17:05.720 --> 17:07.939
Because sin lives
in the shadows.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.812
Hey, speaking of sin...

17:13.554 --> 17:15.034
You ready?

17:15.121 --> 17:16.513
-Yes.
-Alright.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.385
[chuckles]

17:20.909 --> 17:22.084
[chuckles]

17:22.171 --> 17:23.520
[phone beeps]

17:26.306 --> 17:28.612
Holy shit.

17:31.441 --> 17:32.964
[sighs]
[chuckles]

17:33.052 --> 17:34.618
I can't believe
we're stranded here.

17:34.705 --> 17:36.794
Yeah, I know, but on
the bright side, no parents.

17:36.881 --> 17:40.015
And Mr. Thompson barely counts
as adult supervision.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.365
I wonder if there's
any food around here.

17:42.452 --> 17:44.672
-Holy shit.
-What?

17:47.196 --> 17:50.591
Dude, Tony says the girls just
invited them over for an orgy.

17:50.678 --> 17:53.028
-No way.
-Yeah, I know, but look.

17:54.725 --> 17:55.900
Man, they're just messing
with him.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.424
He says they're serious.

17:57.511 --> 18:00.122
No, then they're definitely
messing with him.

18:00.209 --> 18:03.082
Yeah, I guess.
Girls are just so immature.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.909
-Totally.
-Boy: What are you looking at?

18:04.996 --> 18:06.998
-Nothing. Nothing.
-It's stupid.

18:11.394 --> 18:15.224
-It's one of those 3D pics?
-Mm...

18:15.311 --> 18:18.619
[sighing]
[grunting]

18:20.316 --> 18:21.883
-You don't think...
-That they'd actually...

18:21.970 --> 18:23.798
-There's no way, right?
-No, no way, of course not.

18:23.885 --> 18:25.930
They're just messing with us,
or them, messing with them.

18:26.017 --> 18:27.280
[laughs]

18:27.367 --> 18:28.890
-They're so gullible.
-I know.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.631
But not us.
We're better than that. No way.

18:30.718 --> 18:31.980
Mm-mm.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.114
[sighs]

18:39.944 --> 18:41.772
-Desk Clerk: Hi.
-Hi, is there
a liquor store nearby?

18:41.859 --> 18:43.861
-Um...
-Thompson: Liquor store?

18:45.254 --> 18:47.038
What for?

18:47.126 --> 18:50.781
Um... supplies,
air freshener for...

18:50.868 --> 18:52.609
Jason's gas problem.

18:52.696 --> 18:55.351
Uh-huh. Come here for a second.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.487
Hey, you know this is
my first band trip, right?

19:00.574 --> 19:03.359
-Yeah.
-Yeah, it's not going
that great.

19:03.446 --> 19:06.057
So, uh, till the bus is fixed,

19:06.145 --> 19:08.669
I kinda need
to take us somewhere
that's at least somewhat...

19:08.756 --> 19:10.149
educational.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.368
Can you help me pick one?

19:13.630 --> 19:16.111
-Okay.
-It's just that
you're a good student.

19:16.198 --> 19:19.332
I'm not a good teacher,
and I'm a temporary one
at that, so...

19:19.419 --> 19:20.768
Till the band kicks off.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.291
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The band, the band.

19:24.119 --> 19:27.905
Well, I can
research these tonight
and hook you up tomorrow.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.603
Would you?
Oh, Morgan, that would rock.

19:29.690 --> 19:32.345
Thank you very much,
I appreciate you.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.042
Oh, one more thing.

19:34.129 --> 19:35.522
Will you help me keep
an eye on the others?

19:35.609 --> 19:37.132
[sighs]
Dude...

19:37.219 --> 19:39.439
I know, nobody wants to be
a narc, it's just that...

19:39.526 --> 19:41.049
I'm all by myself out here.

19:41.136 --> 19:43.791
Just keep an ear out,
no one will know.

19:43.878 --> 19:48.230
Besides, I'll know if anyone
leaves their room after curfew.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.278
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.497
Just a little something
my teacher did to our rooms
back in the day.

19:54.584 --> 19:57.021
'Course, we got around it.

20:00.329 --> 20:02.592
Let's just say there was
a sacrificial lamb

20:02.679 --> 20:04.246
with political capital.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.685
-I have no idea
what that means.
-Well, good!

20:08.772 --> 20:11.558
Hey, it's our little secret,
though, right, Mr. My Spy?

20:11.645 --> 20:12.907
Right.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.660
Is there a liquor store nearby?

20:26.747 --> 20:29.315
[rock music plays]

20:44.330 --> 20:46.462
[door opens and closes]

20:46.549 --> 20:47.855
How'd you do?

20:47.942 --> 20:49.509
Pretty good.
We got a problem though.

20:49.596 --> 20:50.379
What?

20:50.466 --> 20:52.468
Mr. Th-- Oh, Jesus!

20:52.555 --> 20:53.948
Mr. Thompson's gonna know
if we leave.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.428
Said he's gonna do something
to the rooms.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.430
-Like a booby trap?
-I don't know.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.910
-What should we do?
-I mean, not much we can do.

20:59.997 --> 21:02.173
This could be like the most
important night of our lives.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.394
So a little trouble might
just be the price of admission.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.353
I guess. Did you find out
where it is?

21:07.440 --> 21:09.137
Oh, yeah, I have a hunch.

21:09.224 --> 21:10.704
Yeah? No!

21:10.791 --> 21:12.401
Now we smell like twinsies,
dude, come on!

21:12.488 --> 21:14.882
-That is not a
good thing, Jason.
-Yes, it is!

21:14.969 --> 21:16.884
[door knocks]

21:16.971 --> 21:19.408
That's curfew, ladies.
No going out, okay?

21:19.495 --> 21:22.193
All: Okay, Mr. T!

21:22.281 --> 21:24.718
-Don't stay up too late.
-We won't!

21:33.509 --> 21:34.728
[door knocks]

21:34.815 --> 21:36.860
That's curfew.
Goodnight, you two.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.384
Goodnight.

21:43.780 --> 21:44.868
[door knocks]

21:44.955 --> 21:46.566
Curfew. Goodnight, gentlemen.

21:46.653 --> 21:48.611
Goodnight, Mr. T!
[yells]

21:50.744 --> 21:51.962
[door knocks]

21:52.049 --> 21:53.703
That's curfew. Goodnight, boys.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.836
-Goodnight, Mr. T.
-Goodnight.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.232
Cutting it close.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.497
Nothing fancy.

22:04.584 --> 22:05.672
Got to keep it casual in case
they open that door

22:05.759 --> 22:08.022
and nothing's going on inside.

22:08.109 --> 22:09.371
What do you guys want?

22:09.458 --> 22:11.112
Nothing, just borrowing
some sugar.

22:11.199 --> 22:12.548
Well, there's no sugar here.

22:12.635 --> 22:13.854
But there's plenty of honey.

22:13.941 --> 22:15.986
[laughs]
Where are you guys goin'?

22:16.073 --> 22:18.293
-Nowhere. Nowhere.
-Nowhere.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.035
[whispering]
Death is just a state of mind.

22:21.122 --> 22:22.297

True friendship
won't be left behind.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.691
[explosive noises,
satellite noises]

22:24.778 --> 22:25.996
Come on.

22:27.128 --> 22:28.216
Nerds.

22:33.917 --> 22:37.704
[sighs]

22:37.791 --> 22:38.922
[whispering]
Okay, come on.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.492
-[Jason shrieks]
-Jesus. Hey, guys.

22:43.579 --> 22:44.754
-Shh.
-Shh.

22:44.841 --> 22:45.842
[whispering]
Where are you going?

22:45.929 --> 22:47.366
The girls are having
an orgy.

22:47.453 --> 22:48.367
-What?
-Shh!

22:48.454 --> 22:49.542
[whispering]
Shut up.

22:49.629 --> 22:50.891
You can't be serious.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.109
It's probably nothing.

22:52.196 --> 22:54.242
Where you going?

22:54.329 --> 22:56.113
Bowling.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.377
You're in trouble because Mr. T
put paper in all the doors.

22:58.464 --> 22:59.682
-Boobytrap.
-That's right.

22:59.769 --> 23:00.901
We can help
seal you back in.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.511
No, I wanna go.

23:02.598 --> 23:03.686
What?

23:03.773 --> 23:05.471
To the orgy.
Where is it?

23:05.558 --> 23:07.908
[laughing]
Maddy, you jest.

23:07.995 --> 23:10.563
No, I'm serious.
It sounds interesting.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.086
Hold on.
I'll be right back.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.528
Where are you going?

23:19.615 --> 23:21.182
That's your job.
Which way?

23:21.269 --> 23:23.445
You're ditching Maddy?
I thought you liked her.

23:23.532 --> 23:24.925
I do, but we're
just friends.

23:25.012 --> 23:26.535
-So are we.
-Yeah, but you invited me,

23:26.622 --> 23:28.058
so I can't ditch you.

23:28.145 --> 23:29.146
[knock on door]

23:29.233 --> 23:31.279
[door creaks]

23:31.366 --> 23:33.586
Hey.

23:33.673 --> 23:35.022
You want something?

23:35.109 --> 23:36.371
Uh...

23:37.328 --> 23:38.286
Sugar?

23:38.373 --> 23:39.722
Okay, who invited you?

23:39.809 --> 23:41.507
Tony.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.770
Tony, did you
invite them?

23:43.857 --> 23:44.901
-Ow!
-Way to go.

23:44.988 --> 23:46.816
Now it's a sausage fest.

23:46.903 --> 23:48.165
Send them away.

23:48.252 --> 23:49.645
Jessica: Sorry, boys.

23:49.732 --> 23:52.213
Wait! You want Mr. Thompson
to find out?

23:52.300 --> 23:54.215
Why, you gonna
narc on us?

23:54.302 --> 23:55.346
No.

23:58.828 --> 23:59.829
But this will.

23:59.916 --> 24:00.874
What the hell is that?

24:00.961 --> 24:01.875
Boobytrap.

24:01.962 --> 24:02.919
Indeed.

24:04.312 --> 24:05.356
But we have a solution.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.575
What is it?

24:06.662 --> 24:09.273
First...
may we come in?

24:09.360 --> 24:11.145
-It's chilly out here.
-[shivers]

24:15.758 --> 24:16.759
You wearing a wire?

24:18.021 --> 24:21.503
I'm kidding.
Come on, maybe you two
can double up or something.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.200
Hurry up.

24:37.998 --> 24:39.695
[Wings blows raspberry]

24:41.784 --> 24:43.046
So, how did you know?

24:44.352 --> 24:45.832
Oh, uh, heh,

24:45.919 --> 24:47.747
Tony didn't actually
invite us,

24:47.834 --> 24:50.837
but Morgan and I did
some sleuthing or whatever...

24:50.924 --> 24:52.752
I mean,
about the boobytrap.

24:52.839 --> 24:54.318
Oh...

24:54.405 --> 24:56.146
-Mr. Thompson told me.
-Wings: Well, hot damn.

24:56.233 --> 24:57.626
Got ourselves
a double agent.

24:57.713 --> 24:59.280
I-- I wouldn't
go that far.

24:59.367 --> 25:01.021
Betraying his trust?

25:01.108 --> 25:02.501
I like it.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.024
So how do we
get around it?

25:04.111 --> 25:05.547
-[knock on door]
-It's the Feds!

25:05.634 --> 25:07.462
[dramatic music]

25:15.122 --> 25:16.166
It's just Maddy.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.734
Who invited you?

25:22.390 --> 25:24.000
-Does it matter?
-Wings: No.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.133
We need more
hot chicks anyways.

25:27.743 --> 25:29.658
Wings: A bird in the hand
is worth a few in the bush.

25:29.745 --> 25:30.746
[door shuts]

25:39.712 --> 25:40.974
I like your pajamas.

25:41.061 --> 25:43.237
Katie: Thanks!
I like yours, too.

25:43.324 --> 25:44.804
You applied
to USC, right?

25:44.891 --> 25:47.241
-Astronomy
and astrophysics.
-Nice!

25:47.328 --> 25:48.459
Arts and architecture.

25:48.547 --> 25:49.722
Maddy: Cool!

25:51.332 --> 25:53.421
So, Morgan,
what should we do?

25:53.508 --> 25:55.205
Huh? Oh.

25:55.292 --> 25:56.903
I-I mean, it varies.
[stammering]

25:56.990 --> 25:58.426
You know, every orgy's
different, you know?

25:58.513 --> 26:00.123
I mean
about the boobytrap.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.038
[chuckling]
Oh... heh...

26:02.125 --> 26:04.911
Uh, we just need
a sacrificial lamb
with political capital.

26:04.998 --> 26:06.477
What the hell's that mean?

26:06.565 --> 26:08.088
Yeah, is that like
a Bible quote or something?

26:08.175 --> 26:09.829
Maddy: It means
you need a fall guy,

26:09.916 --> 26:11.831
someone who puts paper
back in everyone's door,

26:11.918 --> 26:13.223
except for theirs.

26:13.310 --> 26:14.703
If they're on
the teacher's good side,

26:14.790 --> 26:16.009
they'll get off
with a warning.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.577
Sacrificial lamb
with political capital.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.275
What she said.

26:21.362 --> 26:22.842
So... who's our lamb?

26:22.929 --> 26:25.105
I'll do it.
Mr. T likes me and Janice,

26:25.192 --> 26:26.541
so we'll get off easy.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.848
Okay, great.
Can we do something now, please?

26:28.935 --> 26:30.414
My fire's dying here.

26:30.501 --> 26:31.851
We could play
Truth or Dare.

26:31.938 --> 26:34.462
[Maddy giggling]

26:34.549 --> 26:35.942
What's so funny?

26:36.029 --> 26:38.205
Uh, nothing.
Nothing. I'm sorry.

26:38.292 --> 26:39.510
It sounds so great.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.425
It's juvenile.

26:41.512 --> 26:43.776
No, it's fun.
I used to play in middle school.

26:43.863 --> 26:45.734
-Me, too.
-Wings: Fine, fine.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.518
Whatever gets
Jessica's fire going.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.911
Maddy, truth or dare?

26:48.998 --> 26:50.260
Oh. Truth.

26:50.347 --> 26:52.045
Lame. What base
have you gotten to?

26:52.132 --> 26:53.176
Second.

26:55.048 --> 26:57.441
Uh... can you be
a little more specific?

26:57.528 --> 26:59.487
If you ask
specific questions.

26:59.574 --> 27:01.271
Nice. Who's next?

27:01.358 --> 27:03.491
[upbeat music]

27:31.084 --> 27:33.129
All right, Jessica.
Truth or dare?

27:33.216 --> 27:34.304
Dare.

27:34.391 --> 27:35.654
Take your shirt off.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.888
Jason.
Truth or dare?

27:52.975 --> 27:55.108
Uh... dare?

27:55.195 --> 27:56.631
Kiss one of the boys.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.938
[chuckling]

27:59.025 --> 28:01.027
-What?
-Wings: Yeah.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.463
Are you trying to
turn this into some kind
of woke party or something?

28:02.550 --> 28:05.640
Shh! It's my turn.
I can do as I please.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.555
Do it, Jason.
I dare you.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.644
Well, wh-who?

28:09.731 --> 28:11.907
Hmm...

28:11.994 --> 28:12.908
Kirk.

28:12.995 --> 28:14.954
What? No way.

28:15.041 --> 28:16.825
You've hardly
done any dares.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.392
Okay, how 'bout this.

28:18.479 --> 28:20.220
If you two kiss...

28:20.307 --> 28:21.569
then I'll kiss
one of the girls.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.397
Deal. You two,
hurry up.

28:25.747 --> 28:26.966
Mm.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.622
-Maddy: Aww.
-Jessica: Aww.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.799
Wow... so brave.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.149
So brave.

28:36.236 --> 28:38.281
All right,
restore balance to the Force.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.429
Damn... girls
are pretty.

28:55.516 --> 28:57.213
Duh. Who's next?

28:59.781 --> 29:01.652
Maddy.
Truth or dare?

29:01.740 --> 29:02.828
Dare.

29:02.915 --> 29:06.440
I dare you
to kiss Morgan.

29:06.527 --> 29:08.964
Uh, would you mind
picking something else?

29:09.051 --> 29:10.574
W-What, are you a prude
or something?

29:10.661 --> 29:13.012
No, I just don't kiss
unless it's serious.

29:13.099 --> 29:15.188
-Prude.
-It's fine.

29:15.275 --> 29:16.842
Just pick
something else.

29:16.929 --> 29:19.540
Okay. How 'bout
you pick two people

29:19.627 --> 29:21.020
to go make out
in that bathroom?

29:21.107 --> 29:22.935
Don't even think about it.

29:23.022 --> 29:25.546
Um, Wings and Yvette.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.940
All right, come on.
That's us, babe.

29:29.071 --> 29:30.594
Katie: Oh!
Get it, girl.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.598
Aww, we don't
get to see? Uhh.

29:34.685 --> 29:35.599
[knock on door,
Jason gasps]

29:35.686 --> 29:36.557
The Feds!

29:36.644 --> 29:38.777
[dramatic music]

29:41.562 --> 29:44.695
-What the hell, man?
-Code Blue.

29:44.783 --> 29:45.653
Ow!

29:48.699 --> 29:49.918
[yawning]
Hello?

29:50.005 --> 29:51.528
Can you explain
the meaning of...

29:51.615 --> 29:54.270
Oh. Oh, God. Uh...

29:54.357 --> 29:55.881
I'm sorry.

29:55.968 --> 29:58.797
Uh, I was just
making my rounds, and...

29:58.884 --> 30:01.190
-Were you all asleep?
-Not all of us.

30:01.277 --> 30:02.931
Ah. Yeah.

30:03.018 --> 30:04.628
Uh, I'm sorry,
I just...

30:04.715 --> 30:07.109
Did you ladies open the door
after curfew?

30:07.196 --> 30:09.503
[sleepily]
Did we?

30:09.590 --> 30:10.765
Oh, yeah.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.462
There was a cat.

30:12.549 --> 30:13.855
A cat?

30:13.942 --> 30:15.422
Yeah, it was meowing
really loud,

30:15.509 --> 30:18.599
so we had to...
shoo it away.

30:18.686 --> 30:20.644
It's so hard
to sleep here.

30:20.731 --> 30:24.039
Yeah, my neighbor snores
like a Greek... god.

30:24.126 --> 30:25.954
[yawning]
Oh, my God.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.826
That sounds terrible.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.610
[Richard inhales sharply]

30:29.697 --> 30:30.829
Do you wanna come in?

30:30.916 --> 30:32.352
Wh-What?

30:32.439 --> 30:34.310
Maybe we can help
each other sleep somehow.

30:34.397 --> 30:37.226
No! No...
Thank you.

30:37.313 --> 30:39.402
I just remembered
that I have ear plugs,

30:39.489 --> 30:41.709
s-so... thank you
for your cooperation,

30:41.796 --> 30:43.015
and good night.

30:43.102 --> 30:44.277
Good night.

30:49.586 --> 30:51.197
[all applaud]

30:55.114 --> 30:57.290
[gentle music]

31:05.733 --> 31:07.996
Wait. Maddy.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.651
Let me tell you what,
I should be the Lamb, not you.

31:10.738 --> 31:11.913
Thanks, but, you know,

31:12.000 --> 31:13.219
you haven't been
in trouble yet.

31:13.306 --> 31:14.873
Plus, you do have a record.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.309
Yeah.

31:19.573 --> 31:22.271
I'm sorry that I was
a moron to you earlier.

31:22.358 --> 31:24.404
I was...

31:24.491 --> 31:27.102
I was just nervous,
you know, having you there,

31:27.189 --> 31:29.191
but... it made it fun.

31:31.237 --> 31:33.282
You know, before
I lock you guys in,

31:33.369 --> 31:34.718
we can go bowling.

31:34.805 --> 31:36.546
[gasps]
Bowling!

31:37.591 --> 31:39.288
I can't.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.421
Mr. T asked me to research
tourist traps for tomorrow.

31:41.508 --> 31:42.726
Wow, he must be desperate.

31:42.813 --> 31:44.772
He's teetering all right.

31:44.859 --> 31:45.947
Good night, boys.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.644
You're a queen among men!

31:47.731 --> 31:49.255
[laughs]

32:07.838 --> 32:12.278
[cars passing, honking]

32:12.365 --> 32:14.976
All right, keep it moving!
Keep it moving.

32:15.063 --> 32:16.412
This looks good.

32:21.678 --> 32:23.202
Awesome! Breakfast.

32:23.289 --> 32:24.812
We got hash browns?

32:27.075 --> 32:29.121
Hi, Maddie, Morgan.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.774
You got the stuff?

32:30.861 --> 32:31.775
What?

32:31.862 --> 32:34.604
You know, the merchandise?

32:34.691 --> 32:35.997
Oh, yeah.

32:39.696 --> 32:41.524
It's cool. She's on our side.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.484
Well, what's the quality?
Good stuff?

32:44.571 --> 32:46.355
Well, this ain't
my usual territory.

32:46.442 --> 32:48.140
But it'll do.

32:48.227 --> 32:49.315
I wrote you
some notes in there too
so you should be

32:49.402 --> 32:51.534
flying easy.

32:51.621 --> 32:53.972
Thank you.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.104
Mr. Thompson:
Impressive.

32:56.191 --> 32:58.759
As usual, it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

32:58.846 --> 33:02.502
Oh, Maddy, did you or Janice
leave your room last night
after curfew?

33:02.589 --> 33:04.460
I went out for some ice. Why?

33:04.547 --> 33:07.550
Oh... no reason.

33:07.637 --> 33:10.031
You know winking is bad, right?

33:10.118 --> 33:11.467
Enjoy your meal.

33:11.554 --> 33:12.816
[Maddy chuckles]

33:14.601 --> 33:15.950
Okay, everybody.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.822
If you exist, pay attention.

33:18.909 --> 33:20.433
Janice?

33:22.870 --> 33:25.046
While we're
waiting for the bus,

33:25.133 --> 33:27.396
I have something very special
planned for us today.

33:27.483 --> 33:29.616
But the competition
starts today.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.661
The judged performance
is not until the afternoon,

33:31.748 --> 33:33.054
so until then...

33:33.141 --> 33:34.838
But meet-and-greet starts
in 20 minutes,

33:34.925 --> 33:36.318
so we'll definitely
miss that.

33:36.405 --> 33:38.146
Yes, but there's nothing
we can do about that now.

33:38.233 --> 33:40.322
So let's try to have some fun!

33:40.409 --> 33:41.323
Like how?

33:41.410 --> 33:43.195
Oh, you'll see.

33:43.282 --> 33:45.458
After breakfast,
we'll take some Ubers

33:45.545 --> 33:48.504
to a super-secret
sightseeing destination.

33:48.591 --> 33:49.592
What is it?

33:49.679 --> 33:51.203
It's a secret.

33:51.290 --> 33:53.509
Which should be very
interesting and educational.

33:53.596 --> 33:54.858
Sounds lame.

33:54.945 --> 33:57.818
Oh, I promise you
it is not lame.

33:57.905 --> 33:59.950
The Pennyfeather House--

34:00.038 --> 34:01.909
Or the Pennyfeather Farmhouse,

34:01.996 --> 34:03.693
as it was sometimes
referred to--

34:03.780 --> 34:06.957
was commissioned by famous
doily pioneer

34:07.045 --> 34:09.264
Fanny Mae Pennyfeather

34:09.351 --> 34:11.266
in 1896,

34:11.353 --> 34:13.529
and designed later that year

34:13.616 --> 34:16.793
by architect
Phineas T. Book III.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.753
Now, because of a particularly
harsh winter,

34:19.840 --> 34:23.583
construction was delayed
until the following year of...

34:23.670 --> 34:25.237
1897.

34:25.324 --> 34:27.674
Once the house was completed,

34:27.761 --> 34:30.851
Mrs. Pennyfeather became
quite the talk of the town,

34:30.938 --> 34:33.419
because of her wonderful
dinner parties,

34:33.506 --> 34:35.595
orange grove soirees,

34:35.682 --> 34:37.858
and her garden,
where she grew

34:37.945 --> 34:40.600
onions, turnips, and...

34:40.687 --> 34:42.863
figs.

34:42.950 --> 34:45.779
Now, before I release you
on the neighborhood to
explore for yourselves,

34:45.866 --> 34:49.304
does anyone have any questions
on the Pennyfeather House?

34:55.310 --> 34:58.400
Uh, didn't Arthur Plowland--

34:58.487 --> 34:59.923
"Plowland"--

35:00.010 --> 35:02.970
uh, famous criminal,
once come to town?

35:03.057 --> 35:05.407
Uh... Yes. Yes!

35:05.494 --> 35:08.193
He was a very famous
cattle thief

35:08.280 --> 35:11.848
who settled down here
to sell cattle of his own.

35:13.546 --> 35:14.503
Ah...

35:14.590 --> 35:16.288
Yeah.

35:16.375 --> 35:17.854
Uh...

35:17.941 --> 35:21.162
Wasn't there a particularly
harsh winter?

35:21.249 --> 35:22.990
-No, you said that.
-Ma'am,

35:23.077 --> 35:26.167
didn't people back then
shoot each other?

35:26.254 --> 35:28.430
Uh, yup, I suppose they did.

35:28.517 --> 35:30.606
Wasn't it also common
that the townsfolk

35:30.693 --> 35:32.869
would just totally
slaughter each other?

35:32.956 --> 35:34.480
Well,

35:34.567 --> 35:37.047
this town outlawed firearms
pretty early on,

35:37.135 --> 35:41.313
so there aren't any shootings
that we know about.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.228
-What about pitchforks?
-Don't think so.

35:43.315 --> 35:47.101
Okay, uh, anyone else
have any other questions?

35:47.188 --> 35:50.844
-Is the bus fixed yet?
-About the house.

35:50.931 --> 35:52.367
No?

35:52.454 --> 35:54.108
Okay, well, how about
a round of applause

35:54.195 --> 35:56.676
for the lovely... Stephanie.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.723
Thank you, everyone.

36:00.810 --> 36:03.596
If you have any further
questions, I will be...

36:03.683 --> 36:06.860
you know, here.

36:06.947 --> 36:09.993
All right.
Go, scram, explore!

36:10.080 --> 36:12.170
Learn.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.737
Mr. T, I was looking here,

36:14.824 --> 36:17.349
and it seems like
we're gonna be missing
the music exchange next,

36:17.436 --> 36:19.089
-and I thought maybe--
-Wayne. Wayne!

36:19.177 --> 36:21.091
I'm expecting a call
from the bus any second,

36:21.179 --> 36:23.050
so why don't you
go ahead and relax.

36:23.137 --> 36:24.617
-Okay?
-Do you have reception?

36:24.704 --> 36:27.707
Yes, I have perfect service.

36:27.794 --> 36:29.796
No, actually it's not that good.

36:29.883 --> 36:31.537
But I'm gonna go find some,
okay?

36:31.624 --> 36:33.843
So why don't you go ahead
and scram, learn.

36:33.930 --> 36:34.975
Okay.

36:39.327 --> 36:40.589
Excuse me.

36:45.028 --> 36:47.944
[playful shouting]

36:50.556 --> 36:53.646
Maddy: Wow, he does
look desperate.

36:53.733 --> 36:56.039
-Poor guy.
-Hey, what are these, shakes?

36:56.126 --> 36:57.519
Snack shack.

36:58.955 --> 37:00.522
If we don't make our judge
performance,

37:00.609 --> 37:02.045
we'll have to forfeit.

37:02.132 --> 37:04.178
Whatever. I just hope
we don't have to stay

37:04.265 --> 37:05.527
in that dump
another night.

37:05.614 --> 37:08.051
Why? You didn't like your kiss?

37:08.138 --> 37:09.879
Well, if we are
stranded again,

37:09.966 --> 37:11.881
all that's left for tomorrow
is the exhibition performance,

37:11.968 --> 37:14.232
the awards,
and the goodbye dance.

37:14.319 --> 37:16.495
After that,
the whole trip's a bust.

37:16.582 --> 37:18.932
No fancy hotels,

37:19.019 --> 37:20.716
no beaches.

37:20.803 --> 37:22.065
It sucks.

37:24.894 --> 37:27.245
And how many seats
does it have?

37:28.637 --> 37:31.161
Okay, you have
anything smaller?

37:31.249 --> 37:34.730
[scoffs] Okay, how much
for the big one?

37:34.817 --> 37:37.080
Per day?

37:37.167 --> 37:39.126
Hey, teacher's pet?

37:39.213 --> 37:40.780
Why don't you go get, uh,

37:40.867 --> 37:42.738
Mr. T and Ranger Chick
together?

37:42.825 --> 37:44.262
Why?

37:44.349 --> 37:46.046
Because it'll get us
unsupervised tonight.

37:46.133 --> 37:47.439
Go get 'em together.

37:47.526 --> 37:48.918
Dude, look at him,
he's freaking out!

37:49.005 --> 37:51.356
Exactly,
it'll cheer him up.

37:51.443 --> 37:54.184
Plus, gets him out of our hair.

37:55.229 --> 37:57.492
What am I supposed to say?

37:57.579 --> 37:59.929
Oh, you guys are so pathetic.

38:09.809 --> 38:11.811
Oh, hi there.
Do you have a question?

38:11.898 --> 38:13.726
Um, no, sorry.

38:13.813 --> 38:17.120
Actually, I hope this isn't
too forward or anything,

38:17.207 --> 38:19.993
but I was just curious
if you were single,

38:20.080 --> 38:22.735
'cause Mr. Thompson is, so...

38:22.822 --> 38:25.390
Oh, [chuckles]
that is forward.

38:25.477 --> 38:27.261
Yeah, I'm sorry.

38:27.348 --> 38:30.090
Um, it's just that, you know,
he's such a great guy,

38:30.177 --> 38:32.919
and he's been really sad since
he and his wife split,

38:33.006 --> 38:34.660
so we've been trying
to cheer him up,

38:34.747 --> 38:36.836
as he's had such a big impact
on all our lives.

38:36.923 --> 38:38.968
Oh, wow. Really?

38:39.055 --> 38:42.145
Yeah, he basically talked
a bunch of us out of suicide.

38:42.232 --> 38:43.799
Aww.

38:56.986 --> 38:59.815
You know, your girlfriend's
pretty cool.

38:59.902 --> 39:01.774
We're just friends.

39:01.861 --> 39:04.124
That's probably 'cause
you don't talk to her.

39:06.779 --> 39:08.215
Hello?

39:13.220 --> 39:14.656
Hello?

39:14.743 --> 39:16.092
Shit.

39:19.139 --> 39:20.532
Hey! No climbing on the walls!

39:20.619 --> 39:22.055
Oh!

39:22.142 --> 39:24.231
Oh, jeez. Sorry.
I'm just...

39:24.318 --> 39:26.712
Man, man, I'm just kidding.
Don't worry about it.

39:26.799 --> 39:29.845
I'm sorry, you look busy.
You busy?

39:29.932 --> 39:31.804
-You're busy.
-No. No, me?

39:31.891 --> 39:33.719
No, just working out some...

39:33.806 --> 39:35.851
transportation issues.

39:35.938 --> 39:38.680
Say, you don't have a cheap
way to get to the coast,

39:38.767 --> 39:39.855
do you?

39:39.942 --> 39:41.727
For all of you?

39:41.814 --> 39:44.033
I don't know what to tell ya,
man, it's a really rural town.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.471
There's not a lot of options.

39:46.558 --> 39:48.777
Are you trying
to leave today,

39:48.864 --> 39:51.432
or are you sticking
around tonight?

39:51.519 --> 39:52.781
Uh, I hope not.

39:52.868 --> 39:55.001
It really depends if this
stupid bus calls.

39:55.088 --> 39:57.438
We're missing this big
international competition thing.

39:57.525 --> 39:58.700
Oh, when is it?

39:58.787 --> 40:00.223
Now.

40:00.310 --> 40:01.747
Now. We're missing it now.

40:01.834 --> 40:03.966
Oh, bummer.

40:04.053 --> 40:06.708
Oh, man, I would take you
in my R.V.,

40:06.795 --> 40:09.755
but it is tiny
and full of junk.

40:09.842 --> 40:12.714
Is it like a history
competition?

40:12.801 --> 40:14.281
No, band!
[laughs]

40:14.368 --> 40:15.674
Yeah, I'm in a--

40:15.761 --> 40:18.111
they're in a
jazz school band.

40:18.198 --> 40:19.895
Oh, you're a band teacher.

40:19.982 --> 40:22.158
Well, technically,
but it's just a temp gig

40:22.245 --> 40:24.465
until my band kicks off.

40:24.552 --> 40:26.293
You know, my adult band.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.338
Rad. That is so awesome.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.863
You are so awesome.

40:30.950 --> 40:33.779
So, if your stupid bus
doesn't call,

40:33.866 --> 40:37.304
we should, uh, go get
a drink or something.

40:37.391 --> 40:38.610
A drink with you?

40:38.697 --> 40:40.916
Uh, wow. All right.

40:41.003 --> 40:43.745
Yeah, that would--
drinks would be rad.

40:43.832 --> 40:45.399
-Totally.
-[laughs]

40:45.486 --> 40:47.096
Uh, I should ask you
for your number.

40:47.183 --> 40:49.664
Oh, yeah, here,
let me type it in for you.

40:49.751 --> 40:50.839
[nervous laugh]

40:54.060 --> 40:55.583
[camera shutter clicks]

40:55.670 --> 40:56.976
So you don't forget me.

40:57.063 --> 40:59.413
Oh, yeah.
No, I won't. Never.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.415
Well, good luck with
your stupid bus.

41:01.502 --> 41:02.982
Thanks. Fingers crossed.

41:03.069 --> 41:05.201
-Yeah.
-But not too crossed.

41:05.288 --> 41:07.203
'Cause, uh, drinks.

41:07.290 --> 41:08.291
-Drinks!
-Drinks!

41:08.378 --> 41:09.728
[laughs] Yeah.

41:09.815 --> 41:12.295
-Yeah, thanks.
-Yeah.

41:28.703 --> 41:31.053
So, how did you get so good
and hooking people up?

41:31.140 --> 41:33.447
I don't know,
I just introduce people

41:33.534 --> 41:36.015
and it usually works out.

41:36.102 --> 41:38.191
So, who would you
introduce me to?

41:38.278 --> 41:39.584
Who do you want?

41:39.671 --> 41:41.455
I don't know.

41:41.542 --> 41:43.196
[sniffs]

41:48.288 --> 41:51.813
So, uh, how did you
get into stargazing?

41:51.900 --> 41:53.423
Well,

41:53.511 --> 41:55.077
there was this guy.

41:55.164 --> 41:57.123
Wait a minute.
Hold on, hold on.

41:57.210 --> 41:58.864
[laughs] I gotta hear this.

41:58.951 --> 42:00.605
Okay.

42:00.692 --> 42:01.954
-So, I was a Freshman,
-Mm-hmm.

42:02.041 --> 42:04.173
and he was a Sophomore,

42:04.260 --> 42:06.045
and, like, we never really
went to my place

42:06.132 --> 42:07.437
because of my parents,

42:07.525 --> 42:09.178
and his were always fighting.

42:09.265 --> 42:12.268
So, we'd go wander around
downtown,

42:12.355 --> 42:14.967
or go hang out
on the playground,

42:15.054 --> 42:18.057
and we'd also lie there
looking up at the stars.

42:18.144 --> 42:20.625
And that's when I would imagine
that we were married

42:20.712 --> 42:23.758
and falling asleep
in our own house.

42:23.845 --> 42:25.847
Anyways,
I-I've been looking up

42:25.934 --> 42:27.545
ever-- ever since.

42:27.632 --> 42:29.068
Hmm.

42:31.026 --> 42:32.724
That's lovely.

42:34.769 --> 42:36.728
You ever...

42:36.815 --> 42:39.731
look up there and see a
bunch of mythical creatures

42:39.818 --> 42:42.516
all united, fighting against
the forces of evil?

42:42.603 --> 42:44.649
What are you talking about?

42:44.736 --> 42:46.564
You know how you're
always asking about

42:46.651 --> 42:48.130
me and Jason's
stupid handshake?

42:48.217 --> 42:49.697
Mm-hmm.

42:49.784 --> 42:51.220
Well, this is
what it's from.

42:51.307 --> 42:52.918
Oh, okay. Okay. Hold on.

42:53.005 --> 42:54.484
-Okay, let's go.
-Yeah.

42:54.572 --> 42:55.703
-Okay, go.
-Okay.

42:55.790 --> 42:57.400
[sighs]

42:57.487 --> 42:59.707
So, when I was growing up,
there was this TV show

42:59.794 --> 43:02.362
called The Intergalactic
Friendship Alliance.

43:02.449 --> 43:05.452
Wait, wait, wait.
The cartoon show for kids?

43:05.539 --> 43:08.847
Kids, nothing. No, this was
ice cold adult storytelling.

43:08.934 --> 43:11.240
A long time ago, there
were all these mythic beings,

43:11.327 --> 43:13.895
like dragons, unicorns,
pegasi, right?

43:13.982 --> 43:15.767
-Mm-hmm.
-But they had to leave Earth

43:15.854 --> 43:18.030
when mankind became
too warlike.

43:18.117 --> 43:20.815
So they scattered all
throughout the universe

43:20.902 --> 43:22.425
met all these aliens,

43:22.512 --> 43:25.211
and formed the Intergalactic
Friendship Alliance.

43:25.298 --> 43:28.083
[laughs] That doesn't
sound very adult.

43:28.170 --> 43:30.695
Well, the Alliance is always
sending out these invitations,

43:30.782 --> 43:32.392
which are these, um,

43:32.479 --> 43:34.176
pearlescent, glowing,
magical orbs

43:34.263 --> 43:35.264
called friendship pearls--

43:35.351 --> 43:36.701
Friendship pearls?

43:36.788 --> 43:38.833
That they fling
across the universe,

43:38.920 --> 43:40.835
hoping that they'll be found
by other beings

43:40.922 --> 43:42.141
worthy enough
to join them.

43:42.228 --> 43:43.664
-Okay.
-Okay,

43:43.751 --> 43:45.492
legend has it that Earth

43:45.579 --> 43:47.450
has already received
its friendship pearl,

43:47.537 --> 43:50.236
but we haven't found it yet,
because we're still not worthy.

43:50.323 --> 43:52.542
So, someday,

43:52.630 --> 43:54.893
someone who's receptive
to its peaceful,

43:54.980 --> 43:56.590
harmonious vibrations

43:56.677 --> 43:58.592
will discover the pearl,

43:58.679 --> 44:00.376
place their hand on it--

44:00.463 --> 44:01.726
Whoosh!

44:01.813 --> 44:03.858
Earth will finally
be able to join

44:03.945 --> 44:05.686
the Intergalactic Friendship
Alliance,

44:05.773 --> 44:07.993
redeeming all of mankind

44:08.080 --> 44:10.560
and swearing to fight
for peace, justice,

44:10.648 --> 44:13.389
and understanding
throughout the universe.

44:13.476 --> 44:16.784
Wow, that is the geekiest thing
I've ever heard.

44:16.871 --> 44:18.003
Yeah.

44:18.090 --> 44:20.353
But I kind of like
how you tell it.

44:22.007 --> 44:24.009
Anyway, our, uh,

44:24.096 --> 44:25.924
our handshake is from
the theme song.

44:26.011 --> 44:27.708
And Jason and I

44:27.795 --> 44:30.102
used to search the entire
neighborhood

44:30.189 --> 44:32.191
for the friendship pearl.

44:33.627 --> 44:35.629
And the show's got
rainbow-throwing dragon ponies,

44:35.716 --> 44:37.631
which is actually pretty dope.

44:37.718 --> 44:40.678
I've never seen anything
like that in the stars,

44:40.765 --> 44:43.245
but I'd like to.
Maybe one day.

44:43.332 --> 44:44.725
Well,

44:44.812 --> 44:46.161
if we're still
stuck here tonight,

44:46.248 --> 44:48.294
maybe we could go "bowling"

44:48.381 --> 44:49.948
for friendship pearls.

44:50.035 --> 44:52.037
That sounds lovely.

44:54.779 --> 44:55.997
There you guys are!

44:56.084 --> 44:57.129
Come on, we're leaving.

44:57.216 --> 44:58.391
Where?

44:59.871 --> 45:03.483
[cars passing, horns honking]

45:03.570 --> 45:08.053
[rhythmic tapping]

45:08.140 --> 45:11.317
-What about tomorrow?
-Doesn't look good, guys.

45:11.404 --> 45:13.798
Bus is in bad shape.

45:13.885 --> 45:15.234
I'm sorry.

45:15.321 --> 45:17.453
They can't send
a replacement?

45:17.540 --> 45:19.020
Everything's booked.

45:19.107 --> 45:22.197
They said they'd call
if something opens up.

45:22.284 --> 45:24.373
Would it help if we
used our phones

45:24.460 --> 45:25.810
to research taxis

45:25.897 --> 45:27.420
or other forms
of public transportation?

45:27.507 --> 45:31.293
Thanks, but we can barely
afford to stay here.

45:31.380 --> 45:33.208
[sighs]
Look guys, I'm sorry,

45:33.295 --> 45:35.254
I've tried
everything.

45:35.341 --> 45:36.777
The only thing we can
really do now

45:36.864 --> 45:38.431
is just hang out.

45:38.518 --> 45:40.172
Try to make the best
of it, okay?

45:40.259 --> 45:42.565
We could call our parents
and ask them to donate money

45:42.652 --> 45:44.263
for Ubers or taxis,

45:44.350 --> 45:45.612
-then tomorrow we could--
-Wayne--Wayne!

45:45.699 --> 45:47.614
We don't have time.

45:47.701 --> 45:49.790
Look, I'm sorry,

45:49.877 --> 45:52.097
I'm as bummed as you
guys are, okay?

45:52.184 --> 45:54.447
But I've experienced a lot
of frustration in my life,

45:54.534 --> 45:57.493
and I'm telling you,
it's all about how you react.

45:57.580 --> 46:00.496
Janice, will you stop drumming
for one goddamn second?

46:03.369 --> 46:04.587
[sighs]

46:06.372 --> 46:08.461
You guys should practice
not giving a shit.

46:08.548 --> 46:11.769
'Cause sometimes
life is shitty.

46:11.856 --> 46:13.683
And sometimes the
only thing you can do

46:13.771 --> 46:16.643
is pull on your big boy
pants and cope.

46:16.730 --> 46:18.297
So we're here,
we exist here.

46:18.384 --> 46:19.951
So deal with it.

46:20.038 --> 46:22.823
It's like...
you're quitting on us.

46:22.910 --> 46:25.608
I'm not quitting
on you, I--

46:27.045 --> 46:30.526
Look, just hang out
here tonight.

46:30.613 --> 46:33.355
When the bus is fixed,
we'll go home.

46:36.358 --> 46:38.099
[deep sigh]

46:38.186 --> 46:40.754
If anyone needs me,
I'll be in my room,

46:40.841 --> 46:42.930
not quitting on you.

46:43.017 --> 46:44.758
When's curfew?

47:11.611 --> 47:15.006
[cars whizzing past]

48:29.602 --> 48:31.517
Hey, Morgan.

48:31.604 --> 48:33.127
Hey.

48:33.214 --> 48:34.912
Pretty lousy night, huh?

48:36.087 --> 48:38.002
Yeah.

48:38.089 --> 48:41.135
I was really looking forward
to the music exchange,

48:41.222 --> 48:42.876
the dance.

48:42.963 --> 48:44.399
You dance?

48:44.486 --> 48:46.140
Uh, like,

48:46.227 --> 48:47.925
geeky dancing

48:48.012 --> 48:49.143
to be funny.

48:49.230 --> 48:51.015
Oh, cool.

48:56.237 --> 48:57.586
[Morgan exhales sharply]

49:01.286 --> 49:03.418
So, uh, where is everyone?

49:03.505 --> 49:05.464
You mean Wings?

49:05.551 --> 49:07.596
No. I...

49:07.683 --> 49:09.076
We got in a fight.

49:10.164 --> 49:12.166
Oh, I'm sorry.

49:12.253 --> 49:16.779
Well, we've never been
super official.

49:16.866 --> 49:20.783
That's why he's always kind
of done whatever he wants.

49:21.871 --> 49:24.657
But these last few days
on this trip,

49:24.744 --> 49:27.051
he's just been acting
so much more

49:27.138 --> 49:28.835
I don't know...

49:29.879 --> 49:31.185
Douchey?

49:31.272 --> 49:32.491
[chuckles] Yeah.

49:32.578 --> 49:34.275
More than usual.

49:34.362 --> 49:36.234
He's been trying to get
this second party going.

49:36.321 --> 49:38.845
He wants it to be hot
or something.

49:38.932 --> 49:40.020
I don't know.

49:40.107 --> 49:41.804
It's just too much
right now.

49:41.891 --> 49:43.197
Yeah.

49:43.284 --> 49:46.331
Sometimes you just
wanna chill.

49:47.810 --> 49:50.465
So, are you coming in,

49:50.552 --> 49:51.379
or..?

49:51.466 --> 49:52.641
[nervous laugh]

49:52.728 --> 49:54.165
I-I don't even have
my swimsuit.

49:54.252 --> 49:56.123
That's okay.

49:56.210 --> 49:57.646
Uh...

49:58.952 --> 50:01.607
Underwear is basically
a swimsuit, right?

50:09.876 --> 50:11.051
[giggles]

50:41.777 --> 50:43.170
You did it!

50:43.257 --> 50:45.172
-I did it!
-[laughs]

50:47.957 --> 50:51.048
You know, I can't picture
you dancing like a geek.

50:51.135 --> 50:53.441
No?

50:53.528 --> 50:55.835
No, you're always
acting so serious,

50:55.922 --> 50:57.054
all the time.

50:57.141 --> 50:58.490
Really?

51:00.709 --> 51:01.884
Huh.

51:03.190 --> 51:05.932
I guess I have funny ideas.
I just don't...

51:06.019 --> 51:07.281
let them out.

51:07.368 --> 51:09.370
You should!
Tell me a joke.

51:09.457 --> 51:10.806
[laughs]

51:10.893 --> 51:13.200
No, I-I can't do that.

51:13.287 --> 51:16.029
Okay, uh,
show me your moves.

51:16.116 --> 51:17.552
That's even worse!

51:17.639 --> 51:19.467
Come on! Okay,
I'll do it with you.

51:19.554 --> 51:21.078
-Really?
-Really.

51:21.165 --> 51:23.558
Okay, uh...

51:23.645 --> 51:25.082
-On three?
-On three.

51:25.169 --> 51:27.258
-Okay.
-One...

51:27.345 --> 51:29.390
-Two.
-Two.

51:29.477 --> 51:31.305
-Three.
-Three.

51:40.967 --> 51:43.012
[laughing]

51:43.100 --> 51:45.972
See, you should let your
geek out more often.

51:46.059 --> 51:48.017
Yeah, right.

51:50.716 --> 51:52.544
You think so?

51:52.631 --> 51:53.936
Definitely.

51:58.071 --> 51:59.942
Hey, look, it's Maddy.

52:03.729 --> 52:05.383
[knocking]

52:08.734 --> 52:10.779
Is she... looking for you?

52:10.866 --> 52:13.652
I don't know. Maybe.

52:26.926 --> 52:30.669
You know, I always thought
Maddy was super serious too.

52:30.756 --> 52:33.976
But she's actually
pretty cool.

52:34.063 --> 52:35.761
You ever thought
about asking her out?

52:37.023 --> 52:38.894
No, we're just friends.

52:38.981 --> 52:40.418
Mm-hmm.

52:40.505 --> 52:42.159
[gate clangs]

52:45.510 --> 52:48.600
Hey, uh, I was thinking
about going stargazing.

52:48.687 --> 52:50.602
You guys wanna come?

52:50.689 --> 52:51.864
Ooh, stargazing!

52:51.951 --> 52:53.648
You ever seen the show
Cosmos?

52:53.735 --> 52:55.868
Yeah! It's amazing.

52:55.955 --> 52:58.000
Um... anyway...

52:58.087 --> 53:01.178
I was hoping to spot
a friendship pearl.

53:01.265 --> 53:03.484
What's a friendship pearl?

53:06.183 --> 53:09.142
It's a kind of meteor.
They're quite rare.

53:09.229 --> 53:11.318
Oh, cool.

53:11.405 --> 53:14.103
I think I'm just gonna hang
here tonight. Thanks, though.

53:14.191 --> 53:17.716
Oh, no worries.
Morgan, do you wanna come?

53:17.803 --> 53:19.848
Uh...

53:19.935 --> 53:21.502
yeah, that sounds fun.

53:21.589 --> 53:22.547
Yvette?!

53:22.634 --> 53:23.896
What?

53:23.983 --> 53:26.115
Come up here!
We're getting started!

53:26.203 --> 53:28.248
No thanks, I'm just
gonna chill here.

53:28.335 --> 53:31.077
Come on! I'm not gonna
have any fun without you.

53:31.164 --> 53:32.513
Please?!

53:32.600 --> 53:34.167
Man: Hey! Some of us
are trying to sleep!

53:34.254 --> 53:35.908
Shut up, dude, nobody's
talking to you.

53:35.995 --> 53:37.953
Man: You little punks
got no respect.

53:38.040 --> 53:40.042
Come up here if you
want some respect!

53:40.129 --> 53:42.915
Yvette, come on!
Seriously, get up here.

53:47.441 --> 53:50.096
Well, I guess
I'll be seeing ya.

53:50.183 --> 53:51.576
Unless you guys
wanna come with?

53:51.663 --> 53:54.013
Maddie, you made it
so fun last time.

53:54.100 --> 53:56.102
Thanks, but I'm okay.

53:56.189 --> 53:57.364
Have fun though.

53:57.451 --> 53:59.714
Okay, sounds good. See you.

54:07.287 --> 54:08.723
I'll go.

54:08.810 --> 54:10.247
Yeah?

54:10.334 --> 54:12.249
Okay, see you up there.

54:15.426 --> 54:16.644
[sighs]

54:18.385 --> 54:19.647
[gate clangs shut]

54:20.953 --> 54:22.694
I'm sorry, I-

54:22.781 --> 54:25.262
Can we just go another time?

54:25.349 --> 54:26.350
[sighs]

54:26.437 --> 54:27.612
Okay.

54:27.699 --> 54:30.092
It's-- It's not that
I don't want to,

54:30.179 --> 54:31.616
It's just, like...

54:31.703 --> 54:33.357
I just want to be around
more people right now.

54:33.444 --> 54:34.923
You know?

54:35.010 --> 54:36.403
You can--
You can come too.

54:36.490 --> 54:38.710
That stuff's not for me.

54:39.711 --> 54:41.843
You can go, though.
I'll be fine.

54:44.106 --> 54:46.326
It's not like
I don't like you.

54:46.413 --> 54:48.067
I know.

54:49.677 --> 54:51.157
I just...

54:53.072 --> 54:54.769
I don't want to miss out.

54:54.856 --> 54:56.423
But you'll have
other opportunities.

54:56.510 --> 54:58.120
Yeah, but not right now.

55:02.603 --> 55:04.170
Well...

55:04.257 --> 55:06.607
you better get going then.

55:24.103 --> 55:25.713
[sighs]

55:27.019 --> 55:28.716
[knocking]

55:30.109 --> 55:31.806
Hey!

55:31.893 --> 55:33.199
What's up, teacher's pet?

55:33.286 --> 55:34.853
Where's your girlfriend?

55:36.463 --> 55:38.639
No, no, no, no.
We're already uneven.

55:38.726 --> 55:39.988
It's okay, I invited him.

55:40.075 --> 55:42.600
I say what's okay.

55:42.687 --> 55:44.602
Now, vamoose.

55:46.299 --> 55:47.518
Oh, there she is.

55:47.605 --> 55:49.737
All right, come on.

55:49.824 --> 55:51.260
[whispers]
What are you doing?

55:51.348 --> 55:52.392
You're not ready
for this stuff.

55:52.479 --> 55:54.394
[whispers]
Neither are you.

56:00.879 --> 56:02.315
So, what did we miss?

56:02.402 --> 56:03.882
Not much.

56:03.969 --> 56:05.318
As you can see.

56:05.405 --> 56:06.885
You guys wanna play
truth or dare again?

56:06.972 --> 56:08.190
-That was fun.
-No.

56:08.277 --> 56:09.627
Enough kid stuff.

56:09.714 --> 56:11.324
Tonight is the real deal.

56:11.411 --> 56:12.760
So how about it, prude?

56:12.847 --> 56:14.109
You in a kissing
mood tonight?

56:14.196 --> 56:15.241
Guess we'll see.

56:15.328 --> 56:16.851
Well, guess again.

56:16.938 --> 56:18.940
If you don't kiss,
you don't stay.

56:19.027 --> 56:20.942
So, who's it gonna be?

56:27.558 --> 56:29.647
Close enough.
All right, who else?

56:32.519 --> 56:34.826
Actually, you two save
that for later

56:34.913 --> 56:36.871
so I don't have to see it.

56:36.958 --> 56:38.612
Wings, this is dumb.

56:38.699 --> 56:40.135
Y'all are making it dumb.

56:40.222 --> 56:42.660
Why am I the only one
coming up with stuff?

56:42.747 --> 56:44.313
Somebody do something.

56:47.099 --> 56:48.579
Touché.

57:06.292 --> 57:08.773
[kissing noises]

57:08.860 --> 57:10.949
Why is everybody
just sitting there?

57:11.036 --> 57:13.299
Either do something
or get out.

57:19.566 --> 57:21.438
[door opens]

57:27.313 --> 57:29.010
[door closes]

57:29.097 --> 57:30.272
Hey, Yvette,

57:30.359 --> 57:31.883
Maddie looks
a little nervous.

57:31.970 --> 57:33.928
Maybe help her out.

57:34.015 --> 57:36.104
I don't think
she wants to.

57:36.191 --> 57:37.628
Fine.

57:37.715 --> 57:39.412
Let her sit there and stare
like a weirdo.

57:39.499 --> 57:41.153
Leave her alone.

58:34.946 --> 58:37.601
[door opens, closes]

58:37.688 --> 58:39.298
[scoffs]
Bunch of downers, man.

58:39.385 --> 58:41.126
Y'all do what you want.

58:41.213 --> 58:42.736
Come on.

58:44.172 --> 58:44.999
[sharp exhale]

58:45.086 --> 58:46.305
By the way,

58:46.392 --> 58:48.263
she likes it when
you touch her neck.

58:49.656 --> 58:51.005
[sighs]

58:51.963 --> 58:53.268
[door closes]

58:54.443 --> 58:56.968
[rhythmic drumming]

59:06.020 --> 59:07.631
[door opens]

59:08.806 --> 59:10.068
[door closes]

59:10.155 --> 59:11.939
I think I messed up.

59:13.071 --> 59:15.552
She'll be okay.

59:15.639 --> 59:17.466
Just give her time.

59:17.554 --> 59:19.120
It'll be all right.

59:20.339 --> 59:21.601
I don't know.

59:25.170 --> 59:26.867
It will be.

59:26.954 --> 59:28.608
Eventually.

59:29.653 --> 59:31.089
You'll see.

59:36.398 --> 59:38.096
Wings:
What's up, love nerds?

59:38.183 --> 59:39.663
Y'all taking a breather?

59:40.620 --> 59:42.143
Us too.

59:42.230 --> 59:44.102
All right, well we're
gonna go get some drinks,

59:44.189 --> 59:46.670
but, uh,
we'll smell you later.

1:00:15.133 --> 1:00:17.135
[wistful music]

1:01:14.409 --> 1:01:15.933
[Yvette chuckles softly]

1:01:19.980 --> 1:01:21.503
-Oh.

1:01:35.735 --> 1:01:37.171
[Yvette chuckles]

1:02:06.157 --> 1:02:07.158
Sorry.

1:02:08.333 --> 1:02:11.118
Don't be.
Always so serious.

1:02:17.646 --> 1:02:19.387
[beeping,
door handle rattles]

1:02:22.086 --> 1:02:23.870
Hey! What's up,
love nerds?

1:02:23.957 --> 1:02:25.959
Oh. Oh, no.

1:02:26.046 --> 1:02:27.613
I didn't...

1:02:27.700 --> 1:02:29.746
May I come in?

1:02:29.833 --> 1:02:32.096
Hey, good job,
teacher's pet.

1:02:32.183 --> 1:02:33.358
Good job.

1:02:34.576 --> 1:02:36.056
Come on, man.

1:02:36.143 --> 1:02:37.623
I'm not gonna hit you.

1:02:38.580 --> 1:02:41.845
I'm happy for you.

1:02:41.932 --> 1:02:42.846
[chuckles softly]

1:02:42.933 --> 1:02:44.586
She's pretty good, right?

1:02:44.673 --> 1:02:46.675
[chuckles]

1:02:46.763 --> 1:02:50.418
All right, well,
if you'll excuse me...

1:02:50.505 --> 1:02:55.162
I think I've had
a little too much...

1:02:55.249 --> 1:02:57.208
-to drink!
-[bathroom door shuts]

1:02:58.557 --> 1:03:00.211
[muffled]
Whoo!

1:03:01.690 --> 1:03:05.259
[Wings mutters indistinctly]

1:03:06.478 --> 1:03:08.132
I won't tell anyone.

1:03:10.830 --> 1:03:14.355
Wings: Hey! Did you guys
have fun tonight?

1:03:14.442 --> 1:03:16.531
You look really cute.

1:03:16.618 --> 1:03:19.665
Morgan, I believe it. Ha!

1:03:19.752 --> 1:03:21.014
I think I should go.

1:03:21.101 --> 1:03:23.147
[chuckles]
Definitely.

1:03:23.234 --> 1:03:26.280
[Wings continues
muttering incoherently]

1:03:29.936 --> 1:03:31.677
Wings: Hey...

1:03:33.331 --> 1:03:37.639
Wings: I'll be through.
[continues indistinctly]

1:03:38.815 --> 1:03:43.471
[door opens and shuts]

1:03:43.558 --> 1:03:45.560
Wings: Can somebody
come hold my hair?

1:03:46.561 --> 1:03:48.868
[gunfire on TV]

1:03:50.087 --> 1:03:51.044
[door shuts]

1:03:51.131 --> 1:03:52.959
Hey, there he is.

1:03:53.046 --> 1:03:54.482
What's up, man?
Where you been?

1:03:54.569 --> 1:03:56.397
I'm just kidding.
I know where you've been.

1:03:56.484 --> 1:03:59.009
[laughs]
So... how was it?
Tell me everything.

1:03:59.096 --> 1:04:01.098
You know, I'd rather not.

1:04:02.316 --> 1:04:03.970
Seriously?

1:04:04.057 --> 1:04:05.058
Okay, fine, I don't really
need the details right now,

1:04:05.145 --> 1:04:06.451
but just the facts.

1:04:06.538 --> 1:04:08.670
Okay, blink once for yes,
twice for no.

1:04:08.757 --> 1:04:10.455
-Man...
-Yes or no?

1:04:10.542 --> 1:04:12.544
-Are you a man now?
-No!

1:04:12.631 --> 1:04:15.460
Okay. I gotcha,
I gotcha.

1:04:15.547 --> 1:04:17.114
But on the downlow,
are you?

1:04:17.201 --> 1:04:18.680
I said I don't want
to talk about it, all right?!

1:04:18.767 --> 1:04:21.118
Okay, sorry.

1:04:21.205 --> 1:04:22.989
It's just kind of just been
a big deal for you lately.

1:04:23.076 --> 1:04:24.599
What?

1:04:24.686 --> 1:04:25.687
What has?

1:04:25.774 --> 1:04:26.819
You're a virgin, man.

1:04:26.906 --> 1:04:28.038
Yeah, so are you!

1:04:29.778 --> 1:04:33.086
Yeah.
But I told you that.

1:04:33.173 --> 1:04:34.827
You never
tell me anything.

1:04:34.914 --> 1:04:36.960
You know what, Jason?
Why don't you just grow up!

1:04:40.398 --> 1:04:42.052
You know what?
Fine.

1:04:42.139 --> 1:04:44.228
You don't need to tell me
anything anymore.

1:04:44.315 --> 1:04:46.360
It's written all over
your shitty attitude.

1:04:46.447 --> 1:04:48.101
[door shuts]

1:04:51.409 --> 1:04:53.193
Wayne:
They totally did it.

1:04:55.456 --> 1:04:57.458
[crickets chirping]

1:05:00.897 --> 1:05:03.377
-Hey, Mr. T.
-Oh! Jesus.

1:05:03.464 --> 1:05:04.726
Maddy!

1:05:04.813 --> 1:05:05.553
[chuckles]

1:05:05.640 --> 1:05:06.598
You scared me.

1:05:06.685 --> 1:05:08.121
I'm sorry.

1:05:09.949 --> 1:05:10.994
What's wrong?

1:05:12.169 --> 1:05:14.606
How can you tell if...

1:05:14.693 --> 1:05:17.652
what you want
is the right thing?

1:05:18.871 --> 1:05:20.568
Hmm...

1:05:24.442 --> 1:05:25.834
That's tricky.

1:05:32.102 --> 1:05:34.582
You know...

1:05:34.669 --> 1:05:37.020
I have a son.

1:05:37.107 --> 1:05:41.111
And... I try to teach
my boy that...

1:05:41.198 --> 1:05:44.375
whatever he's feeling
is okay.

1:05:44.462 --> 1:05:47.944
'Cause a feeling can't be wrong
till it becomes an action.

1:05:50.947 --> 1:05:53.210
Guess that doesn't help you
know if it's right or wrong.

1:05:54.820 --> 1:05:57.692
Maybe if something feels right
and it doesn't hurt anyone?

1:05:58.824 --> 1:06:01.653
That's what we go for.

1:06:01.740 --> 1:06:04.308
Just... keep trying

1:06:04.395 --> 1:06:07.441
and see how far
that right feeling takes us.

1:06:07.528 --> 1:06:10.662
[near tears]
Then... I think I'm wrong.

1:06:14.709 --> 1:06:16.146
[sniffles]

1:06:27.940 --> 1:06:29.811
Richard: Hello?

1:06:29.898 --> 1:06:34.947
Hey. Yes, it's Daddy.

1:06:35.034 --> 1:06:36.601
How are you?
How's my boy?

1:06:37.863 --> 1:06:39.169
You havin' fun with Mommy?

1:06:40.518 --> 1:06:42.302
Boy: Yeah.

1:06:42.389 --> 1:06:45.305
Yeah? What have you
been doing?

1:06:45.392 --> 1:06:46.959
Games.

1:06:47.046 --> 1:06:49.266
The sprinkler.

1:06:49.353 --> 1:06:51.355
We made sandwiches.

1:06:51.442 --> 1:06:53.966
You made sandwiches?

1:06:54.053 --> 1:06:56.751
What kind of sandwiches?

1:06:56.838 --> 1:07:00.233
Peanut butter and jelly.

1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:02.105
Ooh, that's my favorite.

1:07:03.628 --> 1:07:06.065
Maybe you can make me one
when I come see you.

1:07:09.286 --> 1:07:11.070
I miss you.
You miss me?

1:07:12.506 --> 1:07:14.030
Yeah.

1:07:14.117 --> 1:07:15.466
I miss you, Daddy.

1:07:16.684 --> 1:07:18.730
Yeah.

1:07:18.817 --> 1:07:19.905
Me too, buddy.

1:07:21.515 --> 1:07:24.910
But I'll come see you
when I get back.

1:07:24.997 --> 1:07:26.172
Pinky swear.

1:07:27.260 --> 1:07:29.436
Woman: Okay, baby.
It's time to go to bed.

1:07:29.523 --> 1:07:30.829
Your dad needs
to bug out.

1:07:33.136 --> 1:07:34.876
I look forward
to that sandwich.

1:07:36.008 --> 1:07:37.053
Okay?

1:07:38.663 --> 1:07:39.794
Okay.

1:07:41.013 --> 1:07:42.145
Woman: Say good night
to Daddy.

1:07:43.798 --> 1:07:45.061
Boy: Good night, Daddy.

1:07:47.106 --> 1:07:49.456
Good night, son.

1:07:49.543 --> 1:07:50.544
Love you.

Hey, idiot,
what are you doing?

1:09:07.839 --> 1:09:09.232
Come on, we're leaving.

1:09:09.319 --> 1:09:11.190
Man, I don't wanna go home.

1:09:11.277 --> 1:09:13.758
Not home, dude,
to the competition-- let's go!

1:09:24.377 --> 1:09:25.944
But we missed
the competition.

1:09:26.031 --> 1:09:27.119
Yeah, but if we hurry,
we can still make

1:09:27.206 --> 1:09:28.729
the good-bye dance.
Come on.

1:09:28.816 --> 1:09:30.905
Richard: Take only what you
need for the dance.

1:09:30.992 --> 1:09:32.777
Toss everything else out

1:09:32.864 --> 1:09:35.388
and combine everything into
as few suitcases as possible.

1:09:35.475 --> 1:09:38.130
Let's go!
Let's go, go, go, go, go, go!

1:09:38.217 --> 1:09:40.045
Don't throw away
your instruments!
