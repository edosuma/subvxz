00:01.293 --> 00:04.649
The Carmichael Show is taped in
front of a live studio audience.

00:04.650 --> 00:07.852
- Bobby, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

00:07.853 --> 00:12.056
Well, how'd you get
yourself electrocuted, son?

00:12.057 --> 00:13.858
You didn't put a George Foreman Grill

00:13.859 --> 00:16.760
on the edge of your tub again, did you?

00:18.029 --> 00:20.064
I told you, Bobby, burgers can wait

00:20.065 --> 00:23.367
until after you're done with your bath.

00:23.368 --> 00:26.404
No, no, no. I was at work,
and my boss had me

00:26.405 --> 00:28.039
rewiring the lights in the lobby.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.374
Yeah, but you're not an
electrician, you are a super.

00:30.375 --> 00:31.843
The only thing you're
supposed to be doing

00:31.844 --> 00:35.446
is looking for mold
and evicting prostitutes.

00:35.447 --> 00:37.982
Okay, Bobby, I hope you're
all right and everything,

00:37.983 --> 00:40.151
but I got $100 riding on this.

00:40.152 --> 00:43.521
Were you trying to cook
burgers in the bathtub again?

00:43.522 --> 00:46.190
No, okay? Will somebody
give me some credit?

00:46.191 --> 00:47.725
I gave you credit, Bobby,

00:47.726 --> 00:50.061
and it won me $100.

00:50.062 --> 00:52.063
Man, I hate my job.

00:52.064 --> 00:54.432
I'm just not cut out
to be fixing things.

00:54.433 --> 00:55.767
As soon as he touched those wires,

00:55.768 --> 00:57.401
he shot across the room.

00:57.402 --> 01:00.505
Made me realize how scared
I am of the police.

01:00.506 --> 01:01.873
He was unconscious for seven minutes,

01:01.874 --> 01:05.176
and I still didn't call 911.

01:05.177 --> 01:07.445
Come here, baby.
Now, hold on now, Cynt.

01:07.446 --> 01:10.548
We got to make sure all the
electricity is out of him.

01:10.549 --> 01:11.582
(alarmed shouts)

01:11.583 --> 01:13.084
(laughter)

01:13.085 --> 01:15.119
I got you on that, didn't I?

01:15.120 --> 01:17.020
- I just reached out...
- (shouting)

01:19.624 --> 01:22.593
I guess it's time to charge my phone.

01:22.594 --> 01:24.661
(shouting)

01:29.066 --> 01:32.637
Joe, you are so good
at lightening the mood.

01:32.638 --> 01:34.639
(sarcastically): Ha ha!

01:34.640 --> 01:37.875
Okay, when I was laying
on death's door,

01:37.876 --> 01:41.612
I realized that my life
hasn't meant anything so far,

01:41.613 --> 01:44.148
and that if I died today,
I wouldn't have anything

01:44.149 --> 01:46.717
to leave behind but
three pair of Jordans

01:46.718 --> 01:49.787
and this Apple Watch.

01:49.788 --> 01:51.956
Dammit, Bobby,
you stole my Apple Watch.

01:51.957 --> 01:54.559
Well, it's mine now,
and it's all I got.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.494
Uh-oh.

01:56.495 --> 01:58.062
What's going on, Nekeisha?

01:58.063 --> 01:59.931
I posted on Facebook to pray for Bobby

01:59.932 --> 02:02.600
'cause he hurt himself,
and most people misunderstood

02:02.601 --> 02:04.602
and think he tried to commit suicide.

02:04.603 --> 02:06.904
Dammit, Nekeisha.

02:06.905 --> 02:09.574
Oh, look, they set up a memorial fund.

02:09.574 --> 02:11.576
Oh, that's nice.

02:11.577 --> 02:14.278
That's so nice. Every little bit helps.

02:14.279 --> 02:16.113
Look at these comments.

02:16.114 --> 02:19.984
"RIP Bobby." "Sad day."

02:19.985 --> 02:23.521
"The signs were all there"?

02:23.522 --> 02:27.390
Why does everybody think
I tried to kill myself?

02:29.460 --> 02:30.962
Hello, I'm Dr. Hunt.

02:30.963 --> 02:33.865
Doctor, this isn't gonna
cause some kind of

02:33.866 --> 02:36.534
long-term erectile dysfunction, is it?

02:36.535 --> 02:38.002
Mom!

02:38.003 --> 02:41.105
I want grandbabies.

02:41.106 --> 02:42.506
There's nothing to worry about.

02:42.507 --> 02:44.609
All his test results came back fine.

02:44.610 --> 02:46.277
Just be careful out
there next time, okay?

02:46.278 --> 02:49.614
All right, man. Thank you, Doc... Wait.

02:49.615 --> 02:51.515
Darnell Hunt?

02:51.516 --> 02:52.516
Darnell Hunt from Reynolds High?

02:52.517 --> 02:53.885
Yes.

02:53.886 --> 02:55.219
It's me, man Bobby Carmichael.

02:55.220 --> 02:56.621
We was in the same class.

02:56.622 --> 02:57.989
Oh, yeah, I remember you.

02:57.990 --> 02:59.457
You used to date that
girl in the wheelchair.

02:59.458 --> 03:03.995
Yeah, that's something I did briefly.

03:03.996 --> 03:06.197
How are you old enough to be a doctor?

03:06.198 --> 03:08.199
Well, after high school
I did four years of college,

03:08.200 --> 03:09.867
then four years of medical school,

03:09.868 --> 03:11.135
then two years of residency

03:11.136 --> 03:12.670
and one year of internship.

03:12.671 --> 03:13.871
And I've been practicing medicine

03:13.872 --> 03:15.172
the last five years.

03:15.173 --> 03:16.674
I'm 34, just like you.

03:16.675 --> 03:19.911
Oh, yeah. (chuckles)

03:19.912 --> 03:21.879
Okay, I got to go.

03:21.880 --> 03:22.980
It was good seeing you, Bobby.

03:22.981 --> 03:24.916
Take care, everybody.

03:24.917 --> 03:26.984
A young, black doctor.

03:26.985 --> 03:29.253
I bet he drives a Tesla.

03:29.254 --> 03:34.725
I get so proud when I see
black people driving Teslas.

03:34.726 --> 03:38.663
Man, seeing how great Darnell's doing

03:38.664 --> 03:39.997
makes me feel like a loser.

03:39.998 --> 03:43.133
Don't say that, Bobby.
His name is Dr. Hunt.

03:44.035 --> 03:46.237
All right, that settles it.

03:46.238 --> 03:48.940
I know what I got to do.

03:48.941 --> 03:51.242
Bobby Carmichael is going to college.

03:51.243 --> 03:53.344
(laughing)

03:53.345 --> 03:54.912
Well, come on, y'all,

03:54.913 --> 03:57.248
laugh at the boy's joke
about going to college.

03:57.249 --> 04:00.150
Don't hurt his feelings.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.988

<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

04:17.846 --> 04:20.132
That's what I get for
opening up to you all.

04:20.132 --> 04:22.341
Well, now, look, Bobby, how the
hell was I supposed to know

04:22.342 --> 04:23.902
you were serious about
wanting to go to college?

04:23.903 --> 04:25.104
Well, now you know I'm serious.

04:25.105 --> 04:26.171
Should I go?

04:26.172 --> 04:29.875
- Bobby?
- No, mmmm.

04:29.876 --> 04:33.011
Bobby could be the first
Carmichael to go to college.

04:33.012 --> 04:34.847
What kind of family
doesn't support that?

04:34.848 --> 04:37.182
A family full of jackals who
don't care about my future.

04:37.183 --> 04:40.986
Bobby, you are not built for college.

04:40.987 --> 04:43.522
I remember when you were
in the third grade,

04:43.523 --> 04:47.960
and I read your "How I Spent
My Summer Vacation" paper.

04:47.961 --> 04:52.063
I thought, this is a kid
who will never go to college.

04:53.432 --> 04:55.834
But you can't give up on a child

04:55.835 --> 04:57.369
in the third grade.

04:57.370 --> 04:59.271
Yeah, but you didn't read that paper.

04:59.272 --> 05:01.673
The teacher called us in.

05:01.674 --> 05:03.842
She was so upset, poor lady.

05:03.843 --> 05:06.812
She quit a couple weeks after that.

05:06.813 --> 05:08.380
Went back to working at the zoo.

05:08.381 --> 05:10.649
Said she was done
with humans altogether.

05:10.650 --> 05:14.219
Look, I think college is
a scam, anyway.

05:14.220 --> 05:16.722
Bobby, you might as well just
join the Church of Scientology.

05:16.723 --> 05:18.790
At least they give you
industry connections

05:18.791 --> 05:20.825
and a wife to cover up
your homosexuality.

05:22.528 --> 05:24.463
Bobby, if you really want
to be successful,

05:24.464 --> 05:26.899
you should focus on developing
your personality.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.201
Being able to charm
and communicate with people

05:29.202 --> 05:30.569
can get you anything you want.

05:30.570 --> 05:32.371
And if your personality is good enough,

05:32.372 --> 05:33.672
you can earn one of those
honorary degrees

05:33.673 --> 05:35.172
like they gave to Bill Cosby.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.677
Before the rapes.

05:38.678 --> 05:41.313
Come on, don't act like the man
never accomplished anything.

05:41.314 --> 05:43.415
First of all, Jerrod,

05:43.416 --> 05:45.584
your personality is not as
good as you think it is.

05:45.585 --> 05:48.187
And stop being so
dismissive of college.

05:48.188 --> 05:49.488
You can get experiences in college

05:49.489 --> 05:50.889
that you can't get anywhere else.

05:50.890 --> 05:52.057
Like what?

05:52.058 --> 05:53.625
Like an education

05:53.626 --> 05:56.328
or valuable connections that
can help you later in life.

05:56.329 --> 05:59.998
Maxine, those are all things
you can get in prison.

05:59.999 --> 06:01.800
JOE: Well, you know,

06:01.801 --> 06:04.036
college and prison do
have a lot in common.

06:04.037 --> 06:05.904
They both have terrible food,

06:05.905 --> 06:07.773
they force you to have a roommate

06:07.774 --> 06:11.510
and sexual assault goes
virtually unpunished.

06:11.511 --> 06:13.812
Okay, college is a lot more than that.

06:13.813 --> 06:15.147
College is nothing like prison.

06:15.148 --> 06:16.815
I can't believe I have to say that.

06:16.816 --> 06:18.850
Well, Maxine,
I don't think you can judge

06:18.851 --> 06:23.254
since you've only been
to one college and zero prisons.

06:25.057 --> 06:28.227
Bobby, in college you can expand
your mind and grow as a person.

06:28.228 --> 06:30.128
I don't know.
I think you can learn more

06:30.129 --> 06:32.064
from YouTube than college, okay?

06:32.065 --> 06:33.665
Look at me.

06:33.666 --> 06:35.067
I mastered origami.

06:35.068 --> 06:37.169
I'm an expert bread maker,

06:37.170 --> 06:39.570
and I'm a midwife.

06:41.506 --> 06:45.644
Bobby, it's just that
when people go to college,

06:45.645 --> 06:48.447
they know what they want to study,

06:48.448 --> 06:50.515
and they have a career in mind.

06:50.516 --> 06:53.051
They have focus and goals
that they want to achieve.

06:53.052 --> 06:54.886
You're just not that guy.

06:54.887 --> 06:57.623
Look, okay, I'm not trying
to be a doctor like Darnell.

06:57.624 --> 06:59.992
I just don't want to do a job I hate.

06:59.993 --> 07:01.727
Want to do something more fulfilling.

07:01.728 --> 07:05.697
Well, I got to get to my
very fulfilling job as TSA.

07:05.698 --> 07:09.134
I sleep well at night
knowing that I protect America

07:09.135 --> 07:10.469
by doing random searches on anyone

07:10.470 --> 07:13.404
with a last name I can't pronounce.

07:15.340 --> 07:19.211
Bobby, college can help you
find a fulfilling career.

07:19.212 --> 07:20.479
Like, I have a client.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.347
He was 39 and homeless,

07:22.348 --> 07:24.616
and then going back to school
turned his entire life around.

07:24.617 --> 07:26.618
In two years, he got
his associate's degree,

07:26.619 --> 07:28.654
and now he's an electrical engineer.

07:28.655 --> 07:32.123
He just electrocuted himself, Maxine.

07:34.159 --> 07:36.895
If you worried about people
thinking that you a failure,

07:36.896 --> 07:38.597
just have a child.

07:38.598 --> 07:41.632
That's a perfect excuse for
your life not to go anywhere.

07:42.634 --> 07:44.202
CYNTHIA: Yeah, Bobby.

07:44.203 --> 07:45.270
Forget about this college.

07:45.271 --> 07:46.938
You could become a parent tomorrow.

07:46.939 --> 07:49.875
We'll just adopt one of them
little Chinese babies.

07:49.876 --> 07:51.443
Well, that settles it.

07:51.444 --> 07:54.211
We gonna be Chinese grandparents.

07:56.014 --> 07:57.983
Bobby, please don't adopt
a Chinese baby.

07:57.984 --> 07:59.318
Think about it.

07:59.319 --> 08:01.053
You're gonna feel
real bad about yourself

08:01.054 --> 08:03.255
when you got a Chinese baby
that's smarter than you

08:03.256 --> 08:07.159
by the time he's seven years old.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.728
Look, okay, I'm not trying
to adopt a Chinese baby.

08:09.729 --> 08:11.163
I just want a career.

08:11.164 --> 08:12.364
Look, you're my parents.

08:12.365 --> 08:14.032
You supposed to encourage me.

08:14.033 --> 08:15.767
Man, you know something? Never mind.

08:15.768 --> 08:17.803
Forget it.

08:17.804 --> 08:21.005
Well, somebody's acting
like a Chinese baby.

08:23.475 --> 08:26.945
(sighs) Don't you guys realize
the damage you do

08:26.946 --> 08:28.447
when you talk to Bobby like that?

08:28.448 --> 08:30.115
No wonder he has low self-esteem.

08:30.116 --> 08:31.917
Do not blame us, Maxine.

08:31.918 --> 08:34.586
We raised Jerrod the exact same way,

08:34.587 --> 08:37.789
and he has more self-esteem
than he deserves.

08:37.789 --> 08:39.091
Yeah.

08:39.092 --> 08:40.958
Yeah, I really do. (scoffs)

08:40.960 --> 08:42.894
I think we all need to go in there,

08:42.895 --> 08:44.396
and we need to go and tell Bobby

08:44.397 --> 08:46.898
that he can do anything
he sets his mind to.

08:46.899 --> 08:49.334
But, Maxine, he can't.

08:49.335 --> 08:51.670
You know, the key to raising kids

08:51.671 --> 08:54.638
is to keep their expectations low.

08:56.341 --> 08:58.477
Now, what does every child

08:58.478 --> 09:01.747
that has shot up a
school have in common?

09:01.748 --> 09:04.216
They were being pushed too
hard by their parents.

09:04.217 --> 09:05.851
You can say whatever you like

09:05.852 --> 09:08.387
about Bobby's lack of accomplishments,

09:08.388 --> 09:12.523
but he has never participated
in a school massacre.

09:15.327 --> 09:17.195
Maxine, you can't keep filling him up

09:17.196 --> 09:19.164
with all this ridiculous nonsense

09:19.165 --> 09:21.333
he has no hope of accomplishing.

09:21.334 --> 09:25.102
That's like putting rocket
fuel in a Toyota Corolla.

09:26.538 --> 09:28.206
Listen, saying anyone can do anything

09:28.207 --> 09:30.142
they set their mind to
sounds great in theory,

09:30.143 --> 09:32.377
but it's just not true
for the real world.

09:32.378 --> 09:34.112
It's just a thing we say,

09:34.113 --> 09:35.480
like "Money can't buy happiness"

09:35.481 --> 09:37.582
or "All brides are beautiful."

09:37.583 --> 09:41.019
All I know is Bobby
is in the kitchen right now

09:41.020 --> 09:43.221
feeling completely disempowered.

09:43.222 --> 09:46.423
So if you guys won't tell him
that you believe in him, I will.

09:50.896 --> 09:52.264
Bobby...

09:52.265 --> 09:54.065
I want you to know

09:54.066 --> 09:56.935
that I think you are an extraordinary,

09:56.936 --> 09:59.337
intelligent, sensitive person.

09:59.338 --> 10:02.340
I am sure you can do anything
that you put your mind to.

10:02.341 --> 10:04.676
You mean that?

10:04.677 --> 10:06.778
I do.

10:06.779 --> 10:10.114
Thanks, Maxine. It means a lot.

10:11.583 --> 10:12.884
Hey, son.

10:12.885 --> 10:14.985
(clears throat)

10:17.722 --> 10:19.957
Father.

10:22.561 --> 10:26.598
Your mother and I don't
want you being all...

10:26.599 --> 10:30.135
disempowered.

10:30.136 --> 10:31.703
We're sorry, Bobby.

10:31.704 --> 10:33.405
We didn't mean to hurt you.

10:33.406 --> 10:35.806
We thought you didn't
believe in you, either.

10:37.943 --> 10:41.513
See, we always were trying
to be realistic with you, son.

10:41.514 --> 10:42.848
We didn't want you to aim too high

10:42.849 --> 10:44.382
'cause we didn't want you get hurt.

10:44.383 --> 10:46.985
Look, I know that.

10:46.986 --> 10:49.321
That's why I actually picked a career

10:49.322 --> 10:51.723
that a guy like me can actually do.

10:51.724 --> 10:54.325
I want to be a therapist
just like Maxine.

11:00.765 --> 11:03.068
Wait, what?

11:03.069 --> 11:06.203
- Well, Bobby, you can definitely do that.
- That's a good idea.

11:07.739 --> 11:11.609
And I am so proud of you
for not aiming too high.

11:13.411 --> 11:15.413
You are a great listener, Bobby,

11:15.414 --> 11:18.483
and, you know, I was gonna
suggest hairdresser,

11:18.484 --> 11:20.352
but now this is even better

11:20.353 --> 11:23.588
'cause you don't even have
to learn to cut hair.

11:23.589 --> 11:25.257
So, what you think, Maxine?

11:25.258 --> 11:27.659
Yeah, Maxine.

11:27.660 --> 11:30.462
What do you think?

11:30.463 --> 11:33.665
Bobby's gonna do your job.

11:33.666 --> 11:35.300
It's good.

11:35.301 --> 11:37.435
It's very good, so good.

11:37.436 --> 11:39.637
(laughs)

11:42.166 --> 11:44.777
Maxine, you're not going
over your case files, are you?

11:44.778 --> 11:46.340
I told you, I don't like talking

11:46.341 --> 11:48.475
about inner-city
pedophilia in the morning.

11:48.476 --> 11:50.678
It ruins the breakfast experience.

11:51.379 --> 11:52.681
Jerrod, I'd appreciate it

11:52.682 --> 11:55.250
if you didn't make jokes about my job.

11:55.251 --> 11:56.885
(laughs)

11:56.886 --> 11:59.154
Somebody's still mad.

11:59.155 --> 12:00.889
No, I'm not mad.

12:00.890 --> 12:02.824
Well, just admit it, Maxine.

12:02.825 --> 12:05.160
You're upset because Bobby
thinks he's smart enough

12:05.161 --> 12:06.628
to do your job.

12:06.629 --> 12:10.265
No, Bobby can do many things.

12:10.266 --> 12:13.134
So, you do think Bobby's
smart enough to do your job.

12:13.135 --> 12:15.070
This has nothing to do
with being smart.

12:15.071 --> 12:18.173
It's just that it's-it's
four years of college

12:18.174 --> 12:20.175
and then three years
of grad school and I just,

12:20.176 --> 12:22.911
I just don't think
that Bobby's skills...

12:22.912 --> 12:24.279
Mm-hmm.

12:24.280 --> 12:27.382
...are the right match
to be a therapist.

12:27.383 --> 12:30.485
You mean like the skill of smartness?

12:30.486 --> 12:31.485
(knock at door)

12:32.220 --> 12:34.923
- Oh, thank God you're home.
- What happened?

12:34.924 --> 12:39.327
Well, your brother asked us to
cosign a $5,000 student loan

12:39.328 --> 12:40.862
at 30% interest.

12:40.863 --> 12:44.065
I love that boy, but only up to $1,300.

12:44.066 --> 12:45.767
Oh, my God.

12:45.768 --> 12:48.169
Yeah, Maxine. The bank classified him

12:48.170 --> 12:50.605
as an extraordinarily high risk.

12:50.606 --> 12:53.808
Apparently, they don't believe
in him as much as you do.

12:53.809 --> 12:56.277
So, what did you tell him?

12:56.278 --> 12:58.279
Nothing. We just said we were thirsty

12:58.280 --> 12:59.614
and we went in the kitchen,

12:59.615 --> 13:02.449
then we snuck out the back door.

13:03.685 --> 13:06.621
Well, you should know
that Maxine doesn't think

13:06.622 --> 13:08.456
he's smart enough to be
a therapist, either.

13:08.457 --> 13:10.859
What?! Well, why the hell
did you encourage him

13:10.860 --> 13:12.293
in the first place?

13:12.294 --> 13:15.029
I did not say that
Bobby wasn't smart enough

13:15.030 --> 13:16.297
and this has nothing to do with anyone

13:16.298 --> 13:18.166
being smarter than anyone else.

13:18.167 --> 13:20.268
I know that you can't
rank people like that.

13:20.269 --> 13:22.170
Of course you can;
that's what schools do.

13:22.171 --> 13:24.938
They rank you from the
smartest to the dumbest people.

13:26.941 --> 13:29.744
Maxine, we all think it, whether
we say it out loud or not.

13:29.745 --> 13:31.312
Like in this room, I'd say it goes me,

13:31.313 --> 13:33.481
then you, then Mom, then Dad.

13:33.482 --> 13:36.751
I don't think that's fair, Jerrod.

13:36.752 --> 13:40.955
It's Dad, then you,
then me, then Maxine.

13:40.956 --> 13:43.057
That is very sweet, honey,
but I've always said

13:43.058 --> 13:45.193
women are smarter than men.

13:45.194 --> 13:47.195
That means it's you,
then me, then Jerrod,

13:47.196 --> 13:49.664
then Maxine. Yes.

13:49.665 --> 13:52.567
Okay, I don't believe
in ranking in people,

13:52.568 --> 13:55.603
but I know I shouldn't be
at the bottom.

13:55.604 --> 13:57.972
(knock at door)

13:57.973 --> 13:59.174
Hey, Jerrod.

13:59.175 --> 14:00.708
Joe, Cynthia,

14:00.709 --> 14:02.377
I've been looking for y'all.

14:02.378 --> 14:04.479
Bobby quit his job so
he can go to school full-time,

14:04.480 --> 14:06.815
- so we gonna have to move in with y'all.
- What?!

14:06.816 --> 14:08.850
You should know that
I got three rules, okay?

14:08.851 --> 14:11.686
I smoke weed when I want,
I play the trumpet when I want

14:11.687 --> 14:13.987
and the third one's a secret.

14:15.657 --> 14:17.959
Joe, Bobby cannot move back in.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.795
I hate looking him in the eye
every morning at breakfast,

14:20.796 --> 14:22.864
pretending like I didn't
hear him up there

14:22.865 --> 14:25.532
listening to that porn
the night before.

14:26.734 --> 14:29.337
Y'all need to move in
with Jerrod and Maxine.

14:29.338 --> 14:30.805
She's the one that started all this.

14:30.806 --> 14:31.639
Okay, cool.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.508
Look, I got three rules.

14:33.509 --> 14:35.443
Maxine, look what you've done.

14:35.444 --> 14:37.412
You've destroyed our family
by believing in Bobby.

14:37.413 --> 14:38.780
Now we got to listen

14:38.781 --> 14:40.715
to Nekeisha's trumpet
solos every night.

14:40.716 --> 14:41.683
And I'm gonna admit it,

14:41.684 --> 14:43.818
I'm not good.

14:43.819 --> 14:46.054
I cannot believe Bobby quit his job.

14:46.055 --> 14:49.123
Mm-hmm, and he trying
to bankrupt this family.

14:49.124 --> 14:52.293
And for what, Maxine?
Just so you can make a point?

14:52.294 --> 14:54.729
(sighs) Fine, I will go
crush his dreams.

14:54.730 --> 14:56.197
Is that what you want to hear?

14:56.198 --> 14:58.031
- Thank you.
- Yeah, finally. - Yeah.

15:02.070 --> 15:03.504
Bobby!

15:03.505 --> 15:05.039
BOBBY: I'm in the kitchen, Ma.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.341
Hey, where did you guys go?

15:06.342 --> 15:07.342
I've been looking
for you for 45 minutes.

15:07.343 --> 15:09.077
Maxine, go.

15:09.078 --> 15:11.579
I don't know,
maybe I shouldn't do this.

15:11.580 --> 15:12.947
It could devastate him.

15:12.948 --> 15:15.183
Maxine...

15:15.184 --> 15:16.817
finish him.

15:18.186 --> 15:19.754
No, no, I'm just playing.

15:19.755 --> 15:21.355
Good luck in there.

15:24.759 --> 15:26.361
Hey, Bobby.

15:26.362 --> 15:28.763
Oh, hey, look, check this out.

15:28.764 --> 15:31.900
Central Piedmont Community College.

15:31.901 --> 15:34.969
And they asked me who's
my biggest inspiration.

15:34.970 --> 15:36.971
And I was gonna type in
Frederick Douglass,

15:36.972 --> 15:39.007
but screw Frederick Douglass.

15:39.008 --> 15:41.942
My biggest inspiration is Maxine.

15:43.511 --> 15:44.379
You know, Frederick Douglass

15:44.380 --> 15:45.446
ain't did nothing compared to you.

15:45.447 --> 15:48.182
(laughs)

15:48.183 --> 15:53.121
Uh, listen, Bobby, I
think we need to talk.

15:53.122 --> 15:55.456
(sighs) Um...

15:55.457 --> 15:57.659
so, before I decided
to study psychology,

15:57.660 --> 16:01.562
I had other career ambitions
that just weren't right for me.

16:01.563 --> 16:02.897
You know, like, at one point,

16:02.898 --> 16:04.632
I thought I wanted
to be a veterinarian,

16:04.633 --> 16:07.001
but then I realized I would
have to euthanize animals

16:07.002 --> 16:09.437
and I don't have what it
takes to look into the eyes

16:09.438 --> 16:13.306
of a poor, innocent
creature and destroy it.

16:18.346 --> 16:22.350
Um, so my point is, um... (sighs)

16:22.351 --> 16:24.385
...if I'm really being honest,

16:24.386 --> 16:27.355
I'm just not confident

16:27.356 --> 16:31.492
that you are able to be a therapist.

16:31.493 --> 16:34.662
Really?

16:34.663 --> 16:37.231
(sighs)

16:37.232 --> 16:39.067
Damn, Maxine.

16:39.068 --> 16:41.102
It's just that you're starting so late,

16:41.103 --> 16:43.338
and the program is really rigorous,

16:43.339 --> 16:45.473
and now it turns out that you're
gonna have to move back home

16:45.474 --> 16:47.141
and put your parents'
finances on the line.

16:47.142 --> 16:49.143
I just, I just don't
have a lot of confidence

16:49.144 --> 16:52.947
that this is gonna work out
and that it's worth the risk.

16:52.948 --> 16:54.415
Um, I'm sorry.

16:54.416 --> 16:58.085
I just felt like you
needed to hear the truth.

16:59.787 --> 17:02.323
Wow.

17:02.324 --> 17:05.157
Wow, that-that hurts.

17:07.060 --> 17:11.031
I mean, I'm used to people
telling I can't do something,

17:11.032 --> 17:14.034
but I never thought
it would come from you.

17:17.038 --> 17:18.772
(sighs) You see, Maxine,

17:18.773 --> 17:20.141
I always thought it was me and you

17:20.142 --> 17:21.175
against the rest of the family.

17:21.175 --> 17:23.011
What do you mean?

17:23.012 --> 17:24.612
It's 'cause, you know,

17:24.613 --> 17:26.481
nobody take us seriously.

17:26.482 --> 17:28.915
Oh.

17:30.852 --> 17:34.455
Um, I guess I never really
thought about it like that.

17:34.456 --> 17:36.858
Look.

17:36.859 --> 17:41.462
When Jerrod brought you home,
I finally thought, like,

17:41.463 --> 17:44.464
wow, there's somebody in
this family just like me.

17:48.970 --> 17:51.939
You see, Maxine, me and you got
the same function, you know?

17:51.940 --> 17:53.875
We're feelers, right?

17:53.876 --> 17:56.277
You know, w-we're able
to deal with our emotions.

17:56.278 --> 18:00.314
Somebody like Jerrod attaches
himself to people like us,

18:00.315 --> 18:02.415
so we can feel his feelings for him.

18:03.851 --> 18:06.220
Hmm.

18:06.221 --> 18:10.291
Bobby, that was really insightful.

18:10.292 --> 18:12.093
You have an emotional intelligence

18:12.094 --> 18:14.062
that not enough people
give you credit for.

18:14.063 --> 18:16.296
I know.

18:20.001 --> 18:22.036
That's why I wanted to be a therapist.

18:22.037 --> 18:24.372
You know what, Bobby?

18:24.373 --> 18:26.274
Forget everything I just said.

18:26.275 --> 18:27.707
Come with me.

18:29.844 --> 18:32.013
I want everyone to listen to me.

18:32.014 --> 18:34.582
Bobby has decided to become a therapist

18:34.583 --> 18:37.085
and I intend to support him.

18:37.086 --> 18:38.586
Oh no, Joe, look in his eyes.

18:38.587 --> 18:40.121
He look like he's full of hope.

18:40.122 --> 18:42.956
What are we gonna do?

18:45.359 --> 18:48.863
I just can't talk Bobby out
of doing something important

18:48.864 --> 18:50.932
that he is passionate about.

18:50.933 --> 18:53.367
And I know you think what I
do for a living is a joke,

18:53.368 --> 18:55.169
but I put my heart
and soul into my work.

18:55.170 --> 18:56.771
My days are filled

18:56.772 --> 19:00.007
with stories of rape and
addiction and homelessness.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.743
And sure, I come home
emotionally exhausted

19:02.744 --> 19:06.314
and I eat my lunch alone in
my car most days so I can cry.

19:06.315 --> 19:08.049
And maybe 80%

19:08.050 --> 19:10.852
of the cases that come across
my desk wind up as failures,

19:10.853 --> 19:12.787
but I give them everything I have

19:12.788 --> 19:14.922
for practically no pay
because it's worth it.

19:14.923 --> 19:16.991
It's worth it

19:16.992 --> 19:18.693
for the heroin addict
who's gonna get AIDS

19:18.694 --> 19:20.194
if I don't get him
access to clean needles.

19:20.195 --> 19:21.762
It is worth it for the teen mom

19:21.763 --> 19:24.465
who is about to give birth alone.

19:24.466 --> 19:26.167
That's what I do

19:26.168 --> 19:27.668
and that's what Bobby is gonna do

19:27.669 --> 19:29.903
because we care about helping people.

19:32.006 --> 19:33.975
Damn, Maxine.

19:33.976 --> 19:37.812
Your job sounds horrible.

19:37.813 --> 19:40.481
And I'd rather be
electrocuted any day, okay?

19:40.482 --> 19:42.850
Look, I'm sorry for
wasting everybody's time.

19:42.851 --> 19:45.753
I haven't gave this
career thing much thought.

19:45.754 --> 19:47.355
I'm-a go back.

19:47.356 --> 19:50.424
Maxine, Maxine. Excuse me, Maxine.

19:50.425 --> 19:52.627
Lunch time!

19:52.628 --> 19:55.763
Well, I didn't mean to discourage him.

19:55.764 --> 19:58.065
I meant to encourage him.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.668
Yeah, I guess next time you're
trying to encourage someone

20:00.669 --> 20:04.539
you shouldn't use the words
"rape," "heroin," and "AIDS."

20:07.520 --> 20:10.652
(laughs) Look at you, man.

20:10.653 --> 20:12.397
80 more hours and I get my license.

20:12.398 --> 20:14.432
I think you found your calling, son.

20:14.434 --> 20:16.802
You know, you're very easy to talk to.

20:16.803 --> 20:19.738
Can I tell you something
I've never told anyone?

20:19.739 --> 20:22.240
Come on, Clyde, look...
that's what I'm here for.

20:22.241 --> 20:23.775
I'm your barber.

20:23.776 --> 20:25.076
I'm gay.

20:26.145 --> 20:28.480
At first I thought it was just a
phase that I was going through

20:28.481 --> 20:30.282
or something I would
just do on the weekend,

20:30.283 --> 20:32.818
but 50 years later, here I am,

20:32.819 --> 20:37.155
married with children and
it's all just built on a lie.

20:37.156 --> 20:40.192
Look, Clyde, you can't
undo what's been done.

20:40.193 --> 20:43.462
You just need to focus
on loving yourself.

20:43.463 --> 20:47.098
Look, man, never apologize

20:47.099 --> 20:50.368
for who you really are.

20:50.369 --> 20:52.838
Damn, you're good.

20:52.839 --> 20:54.806
Thanks for not judging me.

20:54.807 --> 20:59.311
But if my wife ever finds out
about this, I'll kill you.

20:59.312 --> 21:01.279
Of course, that goes without saying.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.348
That'll be $11.

21:03.349 --> 21:06.140
