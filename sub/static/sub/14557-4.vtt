00:10.378 --> 00:16.784
* Do you believe
what you see...? *

00:16.817 --> 00:19.387
( water splashing gently )

00:22.690 --> 00:27.395
( gentle pop music continues )

00:36.404 --> 00:39.773
( phone ringing )

00:39.807 --> 00:42.576
Coming.

00:47.681 --> 00:48.816
Hello?

00:48.849 --> 00:50.351
( dial tone )

00:50.384 --> 00:52.353
Hmm.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.724
Hmm.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.596
( screams )

01:04.865 --> 01:06.467
No!

01:08.569 --> 01:10.604
( panting )

01:19.747 --> 01:21.715
( soft groan )

01:26.487 --> 01:27.621
( whimpering )

01:27.655 --> 01:29.157
911. What's your emergency?

01:29.190 --> 01:32.760
Somebody... please help me...

01:32.793 --> 01:34.195
Someone's trying
to kill me!

01:34.228 --> 01:35.329
-( banging on door )
-Help me!

01:35.363 --> 01:36.564
( indistinct excited chatter )

01:36.597 --> 01:37.831
Uh, you know what?
It's all right.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.800
Ever since they, uh,
made the goalie pads smaller,

01:39.833 --> 01:42.236
my stats analysis has been
thrown off anyway, so...

01:42.270 --> 01:43.404
You're no fun, man.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.639
Hockey is-is-is
more than stats.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.441
The stats are fun for-for me.

01:47.475 --> 01:48.842
REPORTER 1:
Hey, guys, look over here!

01:48.876 --> 01:50.578
REPORTER 2:
Hey, fellas, look in the lens!

01:50.611 --> 01:51.645
Why do they want pictures
of us?

01:51.679 --> 01:53.214
He's a famous
mathematician!

01:53.247 --> 01:54.548
No, don't do that.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.517
Go ahead, get your vogue on,
Charlie, go ahead.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.551
( loud, indistinct chatter )

01:57.585 --> 02:00.521
Hey. Victor Smith,

02:00.554 --> 02:01.655
L.A.P.D. Threat Assessment.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.591
Don Eppes. This is
my brother Charlie.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.692
He consults with
the bureau.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.160
What do you
got here?

02:06.194 --> 02:08.196
Looks like
he broke the security system.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.463
Scared her pretty good.

02:09.497 --> 02:10.664
What, she was
here by herself?

02:10.698 --> 02:12.600
Yeah, her husband's overseas
making a movie.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.335
We called and left word.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.337
Apparently, she's been receiving
threatening cards

02:16.370 --> 02:17.738
and letters
for some time now.

02:17.771 --> 02:18.906
Never took them seriously.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.308
Uh-huh.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.176
Yeah, looks like
this psycho was nice enough

02:22.210 --> 02:24.812
to use the U.S. mail,
make this a federal case.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.614
Well, lucky us.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.616
Yeah, she's right
around the corner.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.384
( garbled radio transmission )

02:30.418 --> 02:31.585
Skylar Wyatt.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.254
Amita loves her, listens

02:33.287 --> 02:34.455
to her CDs
all the time.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.623
Oh, yeah?

02:35.656 --> 02:37.425
Just hang back for
a second, will you?

02:37.458 --> 02:39.693
( garbled radio transmission )

02:39.727 --> 02:41.695
All right, Officer,
I got it, thanks.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.465
How you doing?

02:44.498 --> 02:45.699
I'm Don Eppes.

02:45.733 --> 02:46.700
I'm with the F.B.I.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.702
( sighs )

02:48.736 --> 02:49.803
You okay?

02:49.837 --> 02:51.305
I'm all right, I guess.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.506
Yeah?

02:52.540 --> 02:55.676
So, what can you tell me
about the intruder?

02:55.709 --> 02:57.511
He had something
over his face.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.746
I couldn't really
see him.

02:58.779 --> 02:59.547
Sorry.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.749
Oh, that's all right,
I understand.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.751
A stocking, maybe?

03:03.784 --> 03:04.718
How long have you been getting
these letters?

03:04.752 --> 03:06.387
About six months.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.821
( clears throat )

03:07.855 --> 03:10.758
And you never reported them
to the police?

03:10.791 --> 03:13.527
I thought if I
told the police

03:13.561 --> 03:15.529
that it'd be all
over the news,

03:15.563 --> 03:17.631
and I'd get even
more letters.

03:17.665 --> 03:20.401
Well, the first thing
that's going to happen is,

03:20.434 --> 03:21.535
we're going to have
to read the letters.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.671
And, uh, if there's any others
that might have been sent

03:23.704 --> 03:26.240
to your agents or managers
or any of those types,

03:26.274 --> 03:27.908
we'll have to see them, as well.

03:27.941 --> 03:29.310
Okay?

03:31.412 --> 03:33.347
The guy got in my house.

03:36.584 --> 03:38.586
You will get him, right?

03:38.619 --> 03:41.455
Well, we're going
to do our best.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.424
MEGAN:
Stalkers fall into six

03:43.457 --> 03:45.426
basic types: Rejected,

03:45.459 --> 03:47.428
Resentful, Predatory,

03:47.461 --> 03:48.729
Intimacy Seeker,

03:48.762 --> 03:50.464
Incompetent Suitor...

03:50.498 --> 03:51.665
DAVID: What if you know
somebody who qualifies

03:51.699 --> 03:53.367
on all accounts?

03:55.636 --> 03:56.570
What if you think
you're dating one?

03:56.604 --> 04:00.308
You guys can laugh,
but studies show that 85%

04:00.341 --> 04:01.509
of all women will
experience some form

04:01.542 --> 04:03.377
of stalking in their lifetime.

04:03.411 --> 04:06.614
Starts with flowers,
and then letters

04:06.647 --> 04:07.948
and then dead bunnies.

04:07.981 --> 04:08.816
Well, how about celebrities?

04:08.849 --> 04:10.518
MEGAN: Public figures
are typically

04:10.551 --> 04:12.686
stalked by incompetent suitors
or erotomaniacs.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.987
And it's not that common

04:14.021 --> 04:15.989
for celebrity stalkers
to become violent.

04:16.023 --> 04:18.025
Why do you think this one has?

04:18.058 --> 04:19.827
Maybe the guy's approached her
at a public event.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.363
He's insulted
that she didn't single him out

04:22.396 --> 04:24.665
for some kind
of special attention.

04:24.698 --> 04:25.766
You think Skylar Wyatt's

04:25.799 --> 04:27.335
actually had contact
with this guy?

04:27.368 --> 04:30.037
Most likely
without her even knowing it.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.973
DAVID:
$20,000 security system.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.643
This guy's the Invisible Man.

04:35.676 --> 04:36.710
Look, camera
placement is based

04:36.744 --> 04:38.045
on a sophisticated
formula

04:38.078 --> 04:39.713
of focal lengths
and field of view

04:39.747 --> 04:40.948
geometries.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.883
They should have picked him up.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.752
She calls 911,
by the time the police arrive

04:44.785 --> 04:47.020
seven minutes later,
stalker is gone.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.756
How come the cameras
didn't see him leave?

04:48.789 --> 04:49.857
Maybe he hid
in the house,

04:49.890 --> 04:51.492
-waited.
-DAVID: L.A.P.D.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.826
cleared it twice, man.
It makes no sense.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.363
They found his footprints
outside.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.698
Check with the neighbors, see
if anyone saw anything unusual.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.032
Right? You know,
stranger, cat missing.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.501
Someone saw something.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.336
He didn't just disappear.

05:05.373 --> 05:06.840
We all use math every day,

05:06.874 --> 05:09.009
to predict weather,

05:09.042 --> 05:11.512
to tell time,

05:11.545 --> 05:15.549
to handle money.

05:15.583 --> 05:19.086
Math is more than formulas
and equations.

05:19.119 --> 05:24.792
It's logic... rationality.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.794
It's using your mind

05:26.827 --> 05:29.897
to solve the biggest mysteries
that we know.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.840
When you said
that you'd purchased a new car,

05:39.873 --> 05:41.875
this isn't exactly
what I was picturing.

05:41.909 --> 05:42.943
Oh, I know.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.946
I guess it was a little
impulsive of me, right?

05:45.979 --> 05:47.080
Very Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

05:47.114 --> 05:47.915
Yeah.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.450
MEGAN:
Nice car,

05:49.483 --> 05:51.084
Dr. Fleinhardt.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.285
Is it new?

05:52.319 --> 05:55.556
Well, only in the sense that
it's newly in my possession.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.125
And it's, like, a '32?

05:58.158 --> 05:59.527
Uh, '31, actually.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.995
Dawn of an amazing
decade-- F.D.R.,

06:02.029 --> 06:05.466
Jesse Owens, Dirac's prediction
of antiparticles.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.501
Yeah, our souls

06:07.535 --> 06:09.169
were rekindled.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.071
CHARLIE:
I can't help but see it as

06:11.104 --> 06:12.440
70-year-old technology.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.507
LARRY:
You're just jealous because

06:13.541 --> 06:14.708
you can't drive
a stick shift.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.676
Hey, you can't beat

06:15.709 --> 06:18.011
automatic transmission
with cruise control.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.880
Charlie tells us

06:19.913 --> 06:21.915
you're looking
for Skylar Wyatt's stalker.

06:21.949 --> 06:22.916
Yeah.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.586
Her security video
didn't pick up his image.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.455
And I understand that
camera placement

06:27.488 --> 06:28.622
is done by
math formulas?

06:28.656 --> 06:29.923
Well, whoever
designed it

06:29.957 --> 06:31.158
probably isn't as good as you,

06:31.191 --> 06:33.427
so maybe you'll find something
they missed.

06:33.461 --> 06:36.063
Larry, a more modern pursuit.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.431
Okay.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.770
Anything?

06:42.803 --> 06:44.772
Yeah. So, on this block
last night, there was

06:44.805 --> 06:46.640
one Zone diet delivery,

06:46.674 --> 06:48.476
two Atkins deliveries,
and a Jenny Craig.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.778
What happened to pizza
and Chinese, man?

06:50.811 --> 06:52.980
Well, this guy down here--
he had a pizza delivered.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.014
Yes.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.716
Of course, then he had
a reflexologist come by

06:55.749 --> 06:56.817
for about an hour
and a half.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.752
-( laughs )
-What about you? What'd you get?

06:58.786 --> 07:00.954
In addition to the usual crowd
of paparazzi,

07:00.988 --> 07:02.856
there's been cable,
satellite,

07:02.890 --> 07:04.858
and Department
of Water and Power.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.794
And not much empathy
for Skylar Wyatt.

07:06.827 --> 07:09.129
Yeah, well, I guess
I can understand that.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.097
How so?

07:10.130 --> 07:12.500
Well, I'm just saying,
if I paid for this view,

07:12.533 --> 07:13.667
I wouldn't want it ruined
by people standing around

07:13.701 --> 07:15.503
trying to take pictures
of my neighbor

07:15.536 --> 07:17.505
sunbathing topless, you know?

07:20.941 --> 07:24.578
Chvatal's Art Gallery Theorem?

07:24.612 --> 07:26.680
That would assume a simple
polygon, though, wouldn't it?

07:26.714 --> 07:27.848
Polygons.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.883
ALAN:
Wow.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.653
I was wondering why we
had no cereal left...

07:32.686 --> 07:34.154
or anything else
that was in the cupboard.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.589
What in the world...

07:35.623 --> 07:36.824
CHARLIE:
I needed the cartons.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.592
We're building a replica
of Skylar Wyatt's house.

07:38.626 --> 07:39.760
We're checking the positioning

07:39.793 --> 07:42.029
of her security cameras
for a blind spot.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.565
Why didn't you just go to
the house and use that?

07:44.598 --> 07:45.599
Well, as part of this test,

07:45.633 --> 07:48.736
we need to be able
to manipulate these walls so as

07:48.769 --> 07:52.072
to determine what types
of angles would be possible

07:52.105 --> 07:53.507
under different scenarios.

07:53.541 --> 07:54.608
That'll help us calculate

07:54.642 --> 07:56.544
these potential blind spots.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.245
And for some reason,
they won't let us move the walls

07:58.278 --> 07:59.212
of the actual house.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.614
How inflexible of them.

08:00.648 --> 08:03.016
What is, uh...

08:03.050 --> 08:04.151
What are those?

08:04.184 --> 08:06.286
CHARLIE: That's where the FBI
found two footprints.

08:06.319 --> 08:09.089
Ah. What conclusions
have you come up with?

08:09.122 --> 08:10.190
LARRY:
Well, for some reason,

08:10.223 --> 08:12.159
we have too many cameras.

08:12.192 --> 08:15.529
That's probably because neither
one of you can read a blueprint.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.797
Let me just take
a look at this.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.135
Now, you see here,

08:22.169 --> 08:24.104
you got the slide door
in the wrong place,

08:24.137 --> 08:27.174
and the dimension of
the parapet is wrong.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.209
It's too high.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.711
Let me fix it for you.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.613
I-I feel like
I'm in the fifth grade again.

08:32.646 --> 08:35.015
Remember, uh... remember, Dad,
when we did that shoe box thing?

08:35.048 --> 08:35.983
Yeah, the diorama.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.251
-Right. -Of Lincoln's
Gettysburg Address.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.987
-The one.
-ALAN: Yeah.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.155
Your mother and I were so happy
to be able to help you out

08:42.189 --> 08:44.124
with anything school-related
that you

08:44.157 --> 08:46.326
conned us into doing
the whole thing for you.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.962
Hey, what are you...! I helped
calculate the aspect ratios

08:48.996 --> 08:50.297
so we could get
the depth effect right.

08:50.330 --> 08:53.133
Yeah, and certainly,
aspect ratios were the key

08:53.166 --> 08:54.702
to perhaps the greatest oratory

08:54.735 --> 08:56.269
-ever written.
-ALAN: There it is.

08:56.303 --> 08:58.205
Right size.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.179
CHARLIE:
Every entry and exit point

09:06.213 --> 09:09.282
seems to be covered
in this array.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.018
The cameras
should have seen him.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.219
Okay, well,

09:12.252 --> 09:14.888
forgive me if I seem
overly reductive here,

09:14.922 --> 09:17.257
but how do we know anyone
was actually

09:17.290 --> 09:18.125
in this house?

09:18.158 --> 09:20.293
Well, you had
that celebrity, right?

09:20.327 --> 09:21.428
She said she saw him.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.196
Right. Plus, there are also
these footprints, Larry.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.665
I mean, this isn't,
uh, Sasquatch.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.034
Must be something wrong
with the cameras.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.702
-They were all functioning.
-ALAN: Well, maybe

09:28.736 --> 09:30.671
there's something wrong
with the way they function.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.172
Okay, let's remember:
the human eye

09:32.205 --> 09:35.008
can only detect color
within

09:35.042 --> 09:37.044
a certain narrow range
of the spectrum.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.681
Now, a camera, which replicates
the ability of the human eye,

09:40.714 --> 09:44.251
is just as limited,
if not more so.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.286
You're right.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.056
The camera's an eye...

09:50.758 --> 09:52.292
and eyes don't see everything.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.796
The cameras looked
right at the stalker...

09:55.829 --> 09:56.964
just didn't know it.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.298
How did that happen?

09:58.331 --> 09:59.967
The camera's iris is designed
to imitate

10:00.000 --> 10:01.802
the function of the human eye.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.637
When we stare directly
into light,

10:03.671 --> 10:05.005
our pupil contracts,

10:05.038 --> 10:07.941
keeping too much light
from blinding us.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.177
And when it's dark,
our pupils dilate,

10:10.210 --> 10:12.713
gathering in all the light
it can find.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.716
A camera's iris works
the exact same way.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.151
It widens when it's dark,
narrows when it's light.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.921
Of course, the human eye
does this much more smoothly.

10:20.954 --> 10:24.191
A camera has a device
called a galvanometer,

10:24.224 --> 10:26.126
which opens and closes its iris.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.228
Now, no doubt, your stalker
had a remote

10:28.261 --> 10:29.697
tuned to the frequency

10:29.730 --> 10:31.799
of the cameras'
galvanometer control.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.166
All he had to do

10:33.200 --> 10:37.237
was freeze the iris
here... here... here...

10:37.270 --> 10:39.339
Each time,

10:39.372 --> 10:41.341
he only needed
a second

10:41.374 --> 10:43.376
that looked perfectly natural,
like the second it takes

10:43.410 --> 10:46.680
for a camera to adjust
from dark to light.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.415
Yeah, but to know what the
camera positions were

10:48.448 --> 10:50.050
and then to move
with such incredible timing...

10:50.083 --> 10:51.218
CHARLIE:
He would have had

10:51.251 --> 10:53.086
to have had access
to the grounds

10:53.120 --> 10:55.122
prior to the night
of the break-in.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.024
But, well, you're just talking
speculation now, right?

10:57.057 --> 11:00.060
Absolutely, it was...
until I ran a curvelet analysis

11:00.093 --> 11:02.362
on the obscured portions
of the recording.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.764
Curvelet's
a mathematical analysis

11:03.797 --> 11:05.999
that defines the edges
of an image.

11:06.033 --> 11:10.103
The analysis reformatted the
pixels that were available...

11:12.372 --> 11:14.875
producing the stalker's image.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.377
Wow. If I didn't know
any better, I'd say

11:17.410 --> 11:19.747
our stalker
was a ghost.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.317
DAVID:
We're running down anyone

11:24.351 --> 11:26.854
who's had access to Skylar's
place in the past year--

11:26.887 --> 11:28.756
contractor,
pool guy, everybody.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.824
Well, whoever it was
studied those cameras,

11:30.858 --> 11:31.925
you know, I mean,
their positions.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.094
Somehow, was able to get
past them-- I don't know.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.162
-We'll work it.
-Right.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.296
Hey.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.799
Hey, can Charlie get anything
else off that video image?

11:38.832 --> 11:39.933
Well, he's
working on it.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.334
How about you
and those letters?

11:41.368 --> 11:42.936
I think I got
something interesting.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.504
Interesting good or
interesting bad?

11:44.537 --> 11:47.374
It's never that good
when it comes to a psychopath.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.743
But these are
the last 20 letters

11:49.777 --> 11:51.311
that Skylar received
from this guy.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.445
Uh-huh.

11:52.479 --> 11:55.248
They're filled with expressions
of apologetic behavior.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.951
-So he knew what he was doing
was wrong. -Actually, he thinks

11:57.985 --> 11:59.152
he's being responsible.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.353
He's afraid he offended her

12:00.387 --> 12:02.790
with the previous one, so now
he's trying to make up for it

12:02.823 --> 12:04.758
with acts of kindness
and love.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.259
But then,
his tone changes again.

12:06.293 --> 12:09.262
In these last few,
he's saying, "You're an idiot

12:09.296 --> 12:10.864
"and people are using you.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.266
And if you're not careful,
you're going to end up dead."

12:13.300 --> 12:15.335
I'd say that's
when he started stalking her.

12:15.368 --> 12:16.536
And when were these sent?

12:16.569 --> 12:17.871
Three weeks ago.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.472
So give me some things
that might...

12:19.506 --> 12:21.274
trigger a change like that.

12:21.308 --> 12:24.211
Well, something happened
that he perceives to be

12:24.244 --> 12:26.279
a rejection,
and he's afraid of being alone.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.982
And he's mad at his victim for
putting him in this position.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.851
That's when stalking
usually begins.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.319
So we should
narrow our search down

12:32.352 --> 12:33.787
to people who've had
contact with her

12:33.821 --> 12:35.823
-in, like, the last three weeks.
-Mm-hmm.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.025
What do you think the chances
are of him laying low

12:38.058 --> 12:38.992
-for a while?
-None.

12:39.026 --> 12:41.461
He'll keep coming back at her
again and again

12:41.494 --> 12:45.032
until he's successful,
or until we stop him.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.002
SKYLAR:
So you're saying

12:49.036 --> 12:51.471
that this nut job
could be somebody that I know?

12:51.504 --> 12:53.406
Yeah, but probably only
that you know vaguely.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.474
Thank you.

12:54.507 --> 12:55.608
Maybe that you met

12:55.642 --> 12:58.178
at a public event or somebody
that you worked with.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.146
Maybe someone stopped you

12:59.179 --> 13:00.914
or asked you for an
autograph recently...

13:00.948 --> 13:02.916
I had a CD signing
a couple of weeks ago.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.885
There were a lot of fans there.

13:04.918 --> 13:05.986
Does that help you any?

13:06.019 --> 13:07.287
MEGAN:
Well, a couple weeks ago

13:07.320 --> 13:08.488
is when the letters
started escalating.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.290
I could probably
get a warrant

13:10.323 --> 13:11.859
to look at the security videos.

13:11.892 --> 13:12.860
Damn it.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.330
All right, look...

13:17.364 --> 13:18.999
I know this is difficult
for you, but...

13:19.032 --> 13:20.901
But what?

13:20.934 --> 13:22.169
It comes with the territory?

13:22.202 --> 13:23.470
It's a necessary evil?

13:23.503 --> 13:25.873
Actually, I was gonna say
I respect the way

13:25.906 --> 13:27.174
you're handling this.

13:27.207 --> 13:31.011
Sorry.

13:31.044 --> 13:34.347
When you can't even look out
your own window...

13:34.381 --> 13:36.449
you start to consider if maybe

13:36.483 --> 13:38.952
the alternative
isn't better.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.954
And the alternative is?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.957
Gary, Indiana.

13:43.991 --> 13:47.060
My mom lives there.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.062
The people treat me regular.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.603
Would you trade it?

13:56.636 --> 13:57.905
What? Fame for privacy?

13:57.938 --> 13:59.139
Are you kidding?

13:59.172 --> 14:00.941
Not me. No, thank you.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.509
What about the money?

14:02.542 --> 14:05.545
Hey, I took this
job, didn't I?

14:05.578 --> 14:08.548
( laughs )

14:08.581 --> 14:10.250
What's up?

14:10.283 --> 14:11.919
D.W.P.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.154
Didn't David and Colby
say something about

14:14.187 --> 14:15.889
them being here last week?

14:15.923 --> 14:16.890
Yeah.

14:16.924 --> 14:19.192
Two meter readings in
the same neighborhood

14:19.226 --> 14:20.527
in less than a week.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.229
Hmm. Seems strange.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.435
Gentlemen.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.003
-Hey, how's it going?
-Good.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.538
Yeah, we're making progress.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.240
Not much yet,
but there is something.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.942
Well, anything
that can help

14:34.975 --> 14:37.010
with height, build,
maybe coloration.

14:37.044 --> 14:39.146
Well, we have
a better outline.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.380
Let me show you.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.983
( beeping )

14:43.016 --> 14:45.052
Oh, okay, that's something.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.087
And in this image,
he may not have the nylon

14:47.120 --> 14:49.622
-over his head. -Yeah, so that
with further enhancement,

14:49.656 --> 14:51.458
we could maybe
see some facial features.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.625
Oh, that would be

14:52.659 --> 14:54.661
really helpful,
but how are you gonna

14:54.694 --> 14:57.264
build an image
out of nothing at all?

14:57.297 --> 14:59.266
That's what we do in astronomy.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.068
We capture tiny
amounts of data

15:01.101 --> 15:02.936
from powerful
radio telescopes.

15:02.970 --> 15:05.472
We use them to construct images
of entire galaxies,

15:05.505 --> 15:06.573
light-years distant.

15:06.606 --> 15:09.242
And that's the same math
as this?

15:09.276 --> 15:10.643
-That's pretty amazing.
-Yeah.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.313
What's the best we can hope for?

15:13.346 --> 15:16.416
There's almost no limit to how
much a photo can be enhanced.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.718
-You only get into deeper math,
the more you... -All it takes

15:18.751 --> 15:21.188
-is math that hasn't been done
yet. -Oh, okay.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.589
Are we working on the case,

15:22.622 --> 15:24.958
or are we trying
to win a Nobel Prize?

15:24.992 --> 15:27.027
There is no Nobel Prize
for mathematics.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.061
Really? You're kidding.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.063
They say that Alfred Nobel's
mistress had an affair

15:30.097 --> 15:31.531
with a very famous
mathematician.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.101
So, naturally, Nobel
wouldn't want to share

15:34.134 --> 15:35.135
his prize with his rival.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.103
So, all you math guys

15:36.136 --> 15:39.006
are aced out 'cause one of you
was good in bed.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.211
Guess so.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.580
What is this?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.482
I don't know.
That was here when I got here.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.418
This was in-in my office?

15:51.451 --> 15:52.752
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
just taped right here

15:52.785 --> 15:54.687
to the blackboard.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.556
Very pretty, Charlie.

15:56.589 --> 15:57.757
( chuckles ):
Pink stationery.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.159
Is it a love note or what?

16:01.761 --> 16:04.031
It's not signed.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.665
Oh, secret admirer.

16:05.698 --> 16:08.235
It's from someone who says
she's a fan of my work

16:08.268 --> 16:09.702
on low-dimensional topology.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.071
Well, yeah...

16:11.104 --> 16:13.473
And she's a fan of my...

16:13.506 --> 16:14.641
...hair.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.143
-( laughs )
-Oh, come on.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.777
Is this Amita's
handwriting, or what?

16:17.810 --> 16:19.112
I don't know.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.413
Maybe. Hmm.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.082
Why wouldn't Amita sign it?

16:23.183 --> 16:25.485
I don't know.

16:25.518 --> 16:29.056
MEGAN:
Owner of the supply store says

16:29.089 --> 16:29.889
Jerry Wilcox bought a uniform

16:29.922 --> 16:31.324
for the Department
of Water and Power.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.361
Anyone can just buy
one of their uniforms?

16:34.394 --> 16:37.530
Yeah, but the thing is,
utility workers get a voucher.

16:37.564 --> 16:40.100
This guy paid for it
with a credit card.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.335
That's why the store owner
remembers him.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.104
We got anything on him?

16:44.137 --> 16:45.738
Other than the fact
that even stalkers

16:45.772 --> 16:47.740
don't take good pictures
at the D.M.V.?

16:47.774 --> 16:49.076
Pulled his tax returns.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.211
Listed occupation: journalist.

16:51.244 --> 16:54.047
Colby's out
hunting him down.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.215
Has no criminal record,

16:55.248 --> 16:57.184
but the neighbors haven't
seen him in about two days.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.252
-What's up?
-Colby just found Wilcox.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.756
COLBY:
Hollywood Hills patrol unit

17:03.790 --> 17:06.093
spotted the Jeep with the
driver-side door open.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.060
Figured the guy

17:07.094 --> 17:09.462
made a run for it,
ran out of real estate.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.499
His body was down
in the brush over here.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.466
How long has
he been dead?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.735
COLBY: According to
the coroner's report,

17:15.768 --> 17:17.137
about 24 hours.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.238
So that's what?

17:18.271 --> 17:19.706
Like, two days
after the break-in

17:19.739 --> 17:21.708
-at Skylar Wyatt's house?
-Yeah.

17:21.741 --> 17:22.809
Anything else?

17:22.842 --> 17:25.445
Well, Jeep is registered
to a Sunshine Incorporated,

17:25.478 --> 17:26.679
so David's

17:26.713 --> 17:27.780
running that down.

17:27.814 --> 17:28.681
Anything inside it?

17:28.715 --> 17:29.849
Ah, the usual stuff:
insurance card...

17:29.882 --> 17:33.386
They did find some computer
stuff, peripherals, CDRs,

17:33.420 --> 17:36.189
-memory sticks.
-DON: We should be canvassing

17:36.223 --> 17:38.291
these houses, obviously,
see if anyone saw anything.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.693
All right.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.205
MEGAN:
Got something?

17:52.239 --> 17:53.540
Think so.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.641
Check this out.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.815
Skylar Wyatt's house?

18:02.849 --> 18:05.318
DON: You said this guy's was a
journalist, so what was he doing

18:05.352 --> 18:06.819
up here two nights
after the break-in?

18:06.853 --> 18:08.788
MEGAN:
If Wilcox was a photographer.

18:08.821 --> 18:13.460
But taking pictures of her after
breaking into her house

18:13.493 --> 18:15.328
doesn't fit the profile
of our stalker.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.829
Maybe he wasn't the stalker.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.466
Maybe the stalker caught him
up here taking pictures

18:19.499 --> 18:21.334
of the girl's house.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.670
And lashed out
in a possessive rage?

18:25.772 --> 18:28.675
Looks like he's in one
of his own tabloid stories.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.454
( whistles )

18:41.488 --> 18:43.456
Something wrong?

18:43.490 --> 18:45.925
I think most of the people over
here would probably say yes.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.527
Just trying
to earn a living, Detective.

18:47.560 --> 18:48.728
FBI.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.197
Feds?

18:50.230 --> 18:51.298
What's going on?

18:51.331 --> 18:52.432
This is what you do, huh?

18:52.465 --> 18:54.501
Stand out here taking pictures
of people having lunch?

18:54.534 --> 18:57.370
Every one of these so-called
celebrities were nobodies

18:57.404 --> 18:59.306
begging to have
their photos taken.

18:59.339 --> 19:00.507
Believe me,

19:00.540 --> 19:01.374
they'd all start complaining

19:01.408 --> 19:03.676
if guys like me
stopped coming around.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.679
I'm not so sure Jerry Wilcox
would agree with that.

19:06.713 --> 19:09.549
Somebody certainly didn't seem
to like what he was up to.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.883
I heard what happened.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.252
It's a shame.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.520
Yeah, we stopped by
your office.

19:13.553 --> 19:14.587
We know he worked for you.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.623
Yeah. Jerry was a nice guy.

19:16.656 --> 19:17.657
Worked for me

19:17.690 --> 19:19.426
as a freelancer.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.428
He got a shot, I'd buy it.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.762
Come on.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.564
What do you guys want?

19:24.597 --> 19:27.667
-Actually, gonna need to borrow
this for a second. -Hey.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.436
This came off
of Wilcox's camera.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.571
It's got your company's
logo on it, so I'm assuming

19:31.604 --> 19:34.507
you got some software in here
that'll tell us what's on it.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.250
COLBY:
What is this?

19:43.283 --> 19:45.352
I have no idea.
Now can I get back to work?

19:45.385 --> 19:46.219
Soon as you tell us

19:46.253 --> 19:47.620
what Wilcox
was doing the night he died

19:47.654 --> 19:48.888
out near Skylar Wyatt's house.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.357
Looks like Brad Pitt's

19:50.390 --> 19:52.792
about to pay his check, dude.

19:52.825 --> 19:56.596
All right, look,
tabloids pay top dollars

19:56.629 --> 19:57.597
for two kinds of photos:

19:57.630 --> 20:00.500
celebrities with babies,
celebrities with lovers.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.668
Last time I checked,

20:01.701 --> 20:03.536
Skylar Wyatt didn't have a kid.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.707
I couldn't see
his face very well,

20:07.740 --> 20:10.477
but I'm pretty sure this
was not the man in my house.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.611
Who is he?

20:11.644 --> 20:14.781
He's a photographer, and he was
killed the other night.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.849
From where we found his body,
he may have been

20:16.883 --> 20:19.519
trying to take
photographs of you.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.421
Do you know, on my honeymoon,

20:21.454 --> 20:24.457
they waited six hours
to get a photo of me topless?

20:24.491 --> 20:25.792
What kind of life is that?

20:25.825 --> 20:28.027
Well, we checked
the photographer's e-mails

20:28.060 --> 20:29.262
the day he was murdered.

20:29.296 --> 20:32.699
He did, in fact, send a number
of messages to various tabloids.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.567
Messages about what?

20:34.601 --> 20:36.369
Seems he thought
he was going to get

20:36.403 --> 20:37.770
some very valuable
photographs of you

20:37.804 --> 20:41.374
the night that he died.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.009
Well, I went to bed at 9:00.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.477
I took an Ambien.

20:44.511 --> 20:45.478
So no idea what

20:45.512 --> 20:47.314
he might have expected to see?

20:47.347 --> 20:49.482
No. None.

20:49.516 --> 20:50.550
I noticed your husband

20:50.583 --> 20:51.684
hasn't rushed home

20:51.718 --> 20:53.386
from Europe yet.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.654
I told you,

20:54.687 --> 20:56.389
he's away doing a movie.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.391
What does that have to do
with anything?

20:58.425 --> 21:01.294
Look, Skylar, a man
has broken into your home,

21:01.328 --> 21:02.962
and now there's a man dead.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.931
Now, we can't
keep this quiet anymore.

21:04.964 --> 21:06.466
And I don't
want to upset you

21:06.499 --> 21:08.968
any more than you already
are, but if I have to,

21:09.001 --> 21:10.737
I will subpoena your phone
records, your e-mail,

21:10.770 --> 21:11.804
I don't care.

21:11.838 --> 21:14.674
And if you think your personal
life is public now...

21:20.647 --> 21:22.048
Dante Baker.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.518
The rap star?

21:25.552 --> 21:27.520
I was supposed to see him
that night.

21:27.554 --> 21:28.788
Only he didn't show up,

21:28.821 --> 21:31.624
so I went to bed.

21:31.658 --> 21:34.527
Now you know my secrets.

21:34.561 --> 21:36.796
Do you know why he didn't show?

21:36.829 --> 21:40.433
No, you'll have to ask Dante.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.435
But you were having
a relationship with him?

21:42.469 --> 21:46.038
If you could call that
a relationship.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.575
The truth is my husband
has been done

21:48.608 --> 21:50.977
with his movie for three weeks.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.112
And since then, he's
been in postproduction,

21:53.145 --> 21:56.916
which basically means he's away
in Paris with his lead actress.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.618
But I'm sure

21:58.651 --> 22:00.520
you already know that, right?

22:00.553 --> 22:03.423
It's all over the tabloids.

22:03.456 --> 22:07.093
We don't really read tabloids.

22:15.802 --> 22:18.104
Yo, what up with these fools?

22:19.606 --> 22:20.707
Hey!

22:20.740 --> 22:22.509
Fore, jackasses!

22:23.743 --> 22:25.612
You believe this?

22:32.619 --> 22:33.886
Can I help you gentlemen?

22:33.920 --> 22:35.855
We'd like to talk
to Mr. Baker.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.624
Dante's golfing now.

22:37.657 --> 22:39.826
No, no, no.
That ain't golfing, man.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.628
I saw that practice swing.

22:41.661 --> 22:42.895
You're using your wrists
way too much, bro.

22:42.929 --> 22:46.098
Oh, yeah, well, maybe you want
to show me what I'm doing wrong?

22:46.132 --> 22:47.800
I would love to.

22:47.834 --> 22:48.968
David.

22:49.001 --> 22:51.504
Just going to drive
the club head

22:51.538 --> 22:53.573
right through the zone,
all right?

22:53.606 --> 22:54.607
Watch.

22:58.778 --> 23:00.413
Oh, yeah.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.549
Just like that.
You see that, man?

23:02.582 --> 23:03.850
That is a beautiful shot.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.618
That's going to play
nicely for you.

23:05.652 --> 23:08.020
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.622
About what?

23:09.656 --> 23:11.123
About a dead photographer

23:11.157 --> 23:12.625
found up on Mulholland.

23:12.659 --> 23:13.660
You know anything about him?

23:15.628 --> 23:19.566
You know, I think maybe I ought
to talk to my lawyer first.

23:19.599 --> 23:20.833
Why would you want
to spend money

23:20.867 --> 23:22.068
talking to a lawyer, Dante?

23:22.101 --> 23:25.605
It's a lot cheaper than talking
to you guys.

23:25.638 --> 23:26.906
Thanks for the lesson.

23:31.043 --> 23:35.615
So if this rapper Dante Baker
is sleeping with Skylar Wyatt,

23:35.648 --> 23:37.016
maybe Wilcox goes
up on Mulholland

23:37.049 --> 23:39.185
to get a picture
of the two of them together.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.554
So, what? Baker finds out
and beats him to death?

23:41.588 --> 23:43.523
I mean, there was
a history of assault.

23:43.556 --> 23:46.025
I read something about a fight
at an awards show.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.560
Or maybe

23:47.594 --> 23:50.563
the killer is the stalker
if he thinks that Skylar

23:50.597 --> 23:52.865
is going to be exploited
by Wilcox.

23:52.899 --> 23:55.101
Charlie thinks he's going to get
an image of the stalker today.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.537
How you doing on
the handwriting analysis?

23:57.570 --> 24:01.107
Secret Service ran it through
something called FISH.

24:01.140 --> 24:05.044
Forensic Information System
for Handwriting.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.813
And you know who worked
on the program?

24:06.846 --> 24:08.214
Let me guess.

24:08.247 --> 24:09.381
AMITA: You've got to drive
it more, Larry.

24:09.415 --> 24:12.251
I mean, you just take it to
campus then bring it home.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.020
That car deserves
the open road, Fleinhardt.

24:14.053 --> 24:16.956
But the very thought of staining
that perfect finish

24:16.989 --> 24:21.060
with sooty exhaust, exposing it
to the negligence

24:21.093 --> 24:22.962
of some Humvee driver
on a cell phone...

24:22.995 --> 24:24.831
All right, Larry,
it's a car.

24:24.864 --> 24:27.166
It's whole function
is to transport you

24:27.199 --> 24:29.135
from point A to point B.

24:29.168 --> 24:31.704
See, this
is the philosophical schism

24:31.738 --> 24:33.139
between a student
of applied science

24:33.172 --> 24:34.774
and a student of the cosmos.

24:34.807 --> 24:38.978
For me, aesthetic beauty is...
it's function enough.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.581
Well, the aesthetic beauty of
the sun is that it works,

24:41.614 --> 24:42.615
not just that it's bright.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.517
Hell of a point.

24:44.551 --> 24:48.855
Well... maybe it's more art
than a machine.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.623
AMITA:
Hey, Megan.

24:50.657 --> 24:51.658
Hey, guys.

24:51.691 --> 24:54.093
Hey. Uh, you're here
for the photo enhancement.

24:54.126 --> 24:56.228
It's, um...
it's still, you know, enhancing.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.997
No, I'm here for FISH.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.566
You mean the, uh,

24:59.599 --> 25:00.700
Forensic Information System
for Handwriting?

25:00.733 --> 25:02.969
All I'll say is that
I helped develop

25:03.002 --> 25:05.037
an algorithm for
the Secret Service, uh,

25:05.071 --> 25:08.240
based on segmentation,
or writing elements,

25:08.274 --> 25:09.809
that are considered
to be in isolation,

25:09.842 --> 25:10.943
such as whole words

25:10.977 --> 25:12.078
or words separated
by pen lifts...

25:12.111 --> 25:14.280
At the moment, we're not having
a lot of luck with it.

25:14.313 --> 25:16.115
Yeah, and I've always thought
that we missed something

25:16.148 --> 25:17.349
in the development
of the software.

25:17.383 --> 25:20.086
So I'm going to take another
crack at it. What do you say?

25:20.119 --> 25:23.255
I thought you'd never ask.

25:23.289 --> 25:25.091
Thanks, Charlie.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.694
Wow.

25:27.727 --> 25:30.062
You know, the thing about
this car,

25:30.096 --> 25:33.065
it's such a classic design
and engineering.

25:33.099 --> 25:36.603
It's more like a work of art
than a vehicle.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.805
Yes, I was saying
the exact same thing.

25:38.838 --> 25:40.873
Dr. Fleinhardt,
you have to promise

25:40.907 --> 25:42.942
to take me for a ride
in this car.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.644
Okay.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.012
Yeah, we could tool around

25:46.045 --> 25:47.914
in the parking lot together,
certainly.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.349
Okay.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.684
Sure.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.827
If you're thinking of sending
these letters to Amita,

26:00.860 --> 26:02.662
I would rethink
your approach.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.163
Laugh riot, Father.

26:04.196 --> 26:05.665
This is for
the stalking case.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.233
I'm now working on
a handwriting algorithm.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.701
Oh, I see.

26:08.735 --> 26:11.270
To try to identify
who wrote them, huh?

26:11.303 --> 26:12.238
And to single out those

26:12.271 --> 26:14.206
that might be written
by different people.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.910
Well, they seem to have been
written by the same guy.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.646
They do, don't they?

26:19.679 --> 26:22.214
You know, I've always said,

26:22.248 --> 26:26.385
handwriting...
it's a lot like...

26:26.418 --> 26:27.519
like gymnastics.

26:27.553 --> 26:30.657
Writing is like running
a floor routine--

26:30.690 --> 26:32.992
the component moves
are like letters,

26:33.025 --> 26:36.195
unique to the person
that executes them.

26:36.228 --> 26:40.199
Handwriting analysis looks for
similarities and differences

26:40.232 --> 26:43.069
in shapes and letters,
choices of writing utensil.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.638
Problem is, the gamma
distribution

26:45.672 --> 26:47.306
used in the FISH program
is limited.

26:47.339 --> 26:49.108
It misses things.
It's stupid.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.643
( knocking )

26:50.677 --> 26:52.344
Charlie, hey.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.980
-Hey, Colby.
-How you doing?

26:54.013 --> 26:56.148
-Well, hey.
-Mr. Eppes, nice to see you.

26:56.182 --> 26:58.250
So Don sent me down here
to check and see

26:58.284 --> 27:00.252
how the handwriting
analysis was going.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.420
I was just telling my father
that we failed

27:01.453 --> 27:03.255
to have the FISH program

27:03.289 --> 27:05.424
take into account that the
shape of an individual letter

27:05.457 --> 27:07.860
varies depending
on where it's placed in a word.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.662
You write an "o" differently
if there's an "s"

27:09.696 --> 27:10.663
placed in front of it.

27:10.697 --> 27:12.398
Accounting for that,

27:12.431 --> 27:14.300
I found some interesting things
about these letters

27:14.333 --> 27:15.301
that we didn't expect.

27:15.334 --> 27:16.335
All right,
what was that?

27:16.368 --> 27:19.071
Hey, look at this.
This letter was an original.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.740
Hey, Charlie, they let you
handle actual evidence?

27:20.773 --> 27:22.241
Give that to me.

27:22.274 --> 27:24.310
There shouldn't be originals,
you should only have copies.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.212
Actually, that's not one
of Skylar Wyatt's letters.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.214
Yeah, I know.
It's addressed to you.

27:28.247 --> 27:29.348
Is that lavender I smell?

27:29.381 --> 27:31.317
Yes. Lavender.

27:31.350 --> 27:32.251
-( cell phone rings )
-Thanks, Charlie.

27:32.284 --> 27:33.953
I got to take this.
I'll be right back.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.688
So who's it from?

27:35.722 --> 27:37.123
Who the hell knows?
It's not signed.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.357
-Not signed?
-No.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.259
Since when does a college
professor receive

27:40.292 --> 27:41.260
anonymous fan letters?

27:41.293 --> 27:42.695
You kidding?

27:42.729 --> 27:43.629
Richard Feynman was a stud.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.898
He got marriage proposals
by the dozen.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.333
Einstein was
a true sex symbol.

27:47.366 --> 27:48.835
Charlie, don't you think
that's from Amita?

27:48.868 --> 27:51.270
Actually, um, no,
because I already

27:51.303 --> 27:52.371
compared it to her writing.

27:52.404 --> 27:53.272
Oh.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.808
So the old FISH system
is inefficient,

27:55.842 --> 27:58.410
but it kicked out a name--
Lawrence Pike.

27:58.444 --> 28:00.212
His handwriting matches
the stalker's.

28:00.246 --> 28:01.313
Okay, that's all
good, but...

28:01.347 --> 28:03.850
But the problem is this guy's
been in jail in Utah

28:03.883 --> 28:06.352
for the last three months,
so he can't be the stalker.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.421
Which is exactly what I was
about to tell you.

28:09.455 --> 28:13.292
The same person did not write
all of these letters.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.394
My analysis says there's
a first writer

28:15.427 --> 28:17.396
and a copycat.

28:28.274 --> 28:30.309
A copycat stalker?

28:30.342 --> 28:32.879
Yeah, the guy who wrote the
original letters is in jail.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.181
But Charlie says the guy who
wrote these most recent ones

28:35.214 --> 28:38.017
is mimicking his handwriting and
even tracing some of the words.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.386
And do we know which ones are
written by stalker number two?

28:40.419 --> 28:42.755
According to your brother,
the last four.

28:42.789 --> 28:44.123
Well, that coincides
with the escalation

28:44.156 --> 28:45.391
in threats against Skylar.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.193
DON: Right. So, I mean,
obviously,

28:47.226 --> 28:48.961
if he copied the letters,

28:48.995 --> 28:49.962
he knew they existed.

28:49.996 --> 28:52.031
Right. He has access to Skylar
and to her home.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.766
And we know it's not
the husband,

28:53.800 --> 28:55.401
because he's been overseas
the entire time.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.469
All right, so I think we should
be putting together a list

28:57.503 --> 29:00.072
of everyone who worked
for her in the last year.

29:00.106 --> 29:01.808
That's housekeepers,
gardeners, trainers, security...

29:01.841 --> 29:03.976
Anybody who could have had
access to those letters.

29:04.010 --> 29:05.077
Exactly.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.212
What about the boyfriend,
Dante Baker?

29:06.245 --> 29:07.880
Yeah, but how's he going to know

29:07.914 --> 29:09.148
that Wilcox is up on Mulholland
that night?

29:09.181 --> 29:12.384
I mean, I'm guessing the same
way Wilcox knew about Skylar.

29:12.418 --> 29:13.619
Someone probably tipped him off.

29:13.652 --> 29:16.088
So we should be focusing on
connecting Baker to that murder.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.056
What do you got?

29:17.089 --> 29:19.058
These are the photos
from the digital disk

29:19.091 --> 29:21.193
we found in Wilcox's S.U.V.

29:21.227 --> 29:23.062
They're all time stamped
just a few hours

29:23.095 --> 29:23.896
before he was killed.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.497
I'm trying to pinpoint
a location.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.166
Wait, so what's this?
Why is he taking pictures of...

29:27.199 --> 29:29.535
-I mean, it's bricks, right?
-Uh-huh.

29:29.568 --> 29:30.702
Maybe he's trying to calibrate
the camera,

29:30.736 --> 29:32.338
take a bunch of pictures,
see if everything's working.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.040
-I don't know.
-MEGAN: Well, wherever this is,

29:34.073 --> 29:35.574
he was there just a few hours
before he died.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.143
Techs blew it up.

29:37.176 --> 29:38.510
There's nothing
in the background,

29:38.544 --> 29:40.212
no way to pinpoint
an address.

29:40.246 --> 29:41.347
You should go talk
to the girl again,

29:41.380 --> 29:44.316
-see if she showed those letters
to anyone else. -Okay.

29:44.350 --> 29:45.952
You think you have something
with this photo?

29:45.985 --> 29:47.319
I think so.

29:47.353 --> 29:48.888
I mean, I read something about

29:48.921 --> 29:49.922
using shadows
to find a location.

29:49.956 --> 29:51.858
It involves math.

29:51.891 --> 29:52.992
I'm going to run it by Charlie.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.261
Find out where he is with
the security video, already.

29:55.294 --> 29:59.198
Boy, he's certainly earning his
consulting fee on this one.

29:59.231 --> 30:02.501
( pop music playing )

30:02.534 --> 30:03.936
Hey, Skylar.

30:03.970 --> 30:04.937
Hey.

30:04.971 --> 30:08.374
Give me a minute.

30:08.407 --> 30:12.144
Guess you have to keep in shape
for your job, too, huh?

30:12.178 --> 30:14.346
I have an audition
in three weeks.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.282
( grunts )

30:16.315 --> 30:17.884
So have you learned
anything yet?

30:17.917 --> 30:18.817
We have.

30:18.851 --> 30:21.087
We're, uh...
we're making some progress.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.022
Good.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.523
Right now,
what I need to know

30:24.556 --> 30:27.093
is if anyone besides you
saw the letters

30:27.126 --> 30:28.160
that you received
from the stalker.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.228
No, I don't think so.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.964
And where did you keep them?

30:31.998 --> 30:34.166
In the kitchen in a drawer.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.068
Some of them
I didn't even open.

30:36.102 --> 30:38.337
Then I think I'll need a list
of everyone

30:38.370 --> 30:40.072
who's had access to the kitchen.

30:40.106 --> 30:44.243
I wouldn't even think you'd
read these tabloids

30:44.276 --> 30:46.412
after everything that
you've been through.

30:46.445 --> 30:48.881
Generally, I don't.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.049
A friend of mine works

30:50.082 --> 30:51.918
as an editor at that one.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.153
She was nice to me when
I first started out.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.022
I gave her the exclusives

30:56.055 --> 30:58.157
to my wedding photos,
for whatever that was worth.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.134
Do you think
I'm unapproachable?

31:08.167 --> 31:09.235
Charlie, your status

31:09.268 --> 31:12.271
on this campus and in your field

31:12.304 --> 31:14.340
is beyond that
of most professors.

31:14.373 --> 31:17.576
Whoever this is, I'm sure
they're just afraid to tell me.

31:17.609 --> 31:21.247
Well, fear of rejection,
that's powerful.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.416
Many a scientist has not
published his work

31:24.450 --> 31:27.086
for fear of being ridiculed
by his colleagues.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.654
You know, this isn't
the first time

31:28.687 --> 31:31.490
I've received a love letter.

31:31.523 --> 31:33.325
When I published
my first article

31:33.359 --> 31:35.027
in the American Journal
of Mathematics,

31:35.061 --> 31:37.429
I was invited
to spend the weekend

31:37.463 --> 31:39.065
at a bed-and-breakfast
in Santa Barbara.

31:39.098 --> 31:41.400
Yeah? Did you go?

31:41.433 --> 31:43.235
Of... I was 14.

31:43.269 --> 31:44.937
My mother had
to break the news

31:44.971 --> 31:47.706
to a very embarrassed female
professor at Berkeley.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.608
( laughs ):
Anyone I know?

31:49.641 --> 31:50.943
Actually...

31:50.977 --> 31:51.944
( knocking )

31:51.978 --> 31:53.512
Charlie, Larry, how you doing?

31:53.545 --> 31:54.947
Hey.

31:54.981 --> 31:56.548
How's the photo enhancement
coming?

31:56.582 --> 31:59.051
The program's been running
through the image we got

31:59.085 --> 32:00.486
from Skylar Wyatt's
video cameras.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.121
This is what we have so far.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.190
That's not enough
for a positive ID.

32:04.223 --> 32:05.457
CHARLIE:
It's still working.

32:05.491 --> 32:06.425
That's great.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.527
We have something new
for you to look at.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.130
It's related to
the same case.

32:11.163 --> 32:12.398
Now, we don't have
an address,

32:12.431 --> 32:14.366
but we're trying to find
out where this place is.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.267
I noticed that

32:15.301 --> 32:17.703
the basketball hoop
was casting a shadow.

32:17.736 --> 32:20.406
I thought I read somewhere that
you can calculate a location

32:20.439 --> 32:21.673
based on shadows.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.642
-Spherical Astronomy.
-Spherical Astronomy.

32:23.675 --> 32:24.643
What's that?

32:24.676 --> 32:25.744
Well, it's a way

32:25.777 --> 32:28.314
of looking at at the cosmos
to define one's location

32:28.347 --> 32:29.315
on the Earth.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.083
Sailors use it

32:31.117 --> 32:32.051
when they're lost at sea.

32:32.084 --> 32:33.185
Cosmologists use it

32:33.219 --> 32:35.121
when we're just plain lost.

32:35.154 --> 32:40.159
And it just happens
to be the same math used

32:40.192 --> 32:42.328
with sundials.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.230
Agent Sinclair, you
just happen to be talking

32:44.263 --> 32:45.064
to two card-carrying members

32:45.097 --> 32:48.067
of the North American
Sundial Society.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.003
Oh. Let the good times roll.

32:51.037 --> 32:52.038
Of course, for this
to work now,

32:52.071 --> 32:53.705
you're going to need more
than one photograph.

32:53.739 --> 32:55.407
Just so happens...

32:58.077 --> 32:59.111
There you go.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.086
You're sure these time stamps
are accurate?

33:07.119 --> 33:08.287
We think so.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.456
We need to measure
the length of the pole

33:10.489 --> 33:13.359
as well as the shadows.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.094
Well, the basketball
hoop looks like

33:15.127 --> 33:16.128
it's regulation height.

33:16.162 --> 33:17.263
Ten feet.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.297
Yeah, and those are bricks

33:18.330 --> 33:20.266
-Right.
-on that driveway.

33:20.299 --> 33:22.668
Bricks? How does that help?

33:22.701 --> 33:23.769
Well, they're the same size.

33:23.802 --> 33:26.405
It allows us to measure
the movement of the shadows.

33:26.438 --> 33:29.175
By measuring the length
of the shadows

33:29.208 --> 33:30.809
against the bricks
and then factoring in

33:30.842 --> 33:33.345
the exact times that
these two images were snapped,

33:33.379 --> 33:35.747
the equation can then determine

33:35.781 --> 33:38.350
the altitude of the sun
on a grid.

33:38.384 --> 33:41.453
Then by mathematically
overlaying these images,

33:41.487 --> 33:44.756
I can provide to you,
with certainty, latitude

33:44.790 --> 33:48.494
and longitude down
to a hundredth of a degree.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.604
( knocks on door )

33:58.637 --> 34:00.272
MAN:
Hold on a second!

34:02.808 --> 34:04.576
Oh, man...

34:04.610 --> 34:07.079
Well, if you're looking
for Dante, he's not here.

34:07.113 --> 34:08.614
Actually,

34:08.647 --> 34:10.116
we're looking for you.

34:10.149 --> 34:12.118
Me?

34:12.151 --> 34:13.752
You want to step outside,
please?

34:21.160 --> 34:22.594
All right, what's this about?

34:22.628 --> 34:24.463
Well, we've been looking
at some pictures.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.598
-Of what?
-Your house.

34:26.632 --> 34:30.202
Yeah, and one of them actually
happens to be a picture of you

34:30.236 --> 34:32.404
standing in Skylar
Wyatt's backyard.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.449
It's not like you think it is.

34:43.482 --> 34:45.551
Yeah? So why don't you
tell us about this?

34:45.584 --> 34:47.786
Which we found
at your house.

34:47.819 --> 34:51.190
Along with these.

34:51.223 --> 34:52.758
Or do you go
both ways?

34:52.791 --> 34:54.126
Is that the problem,
Orville?

34:55.394 --> 34:56.828
Look, we know you
drove Dante

34:56.862 --> 34:58.464
to Skylar's
house many times

34:58.497 --> 34:59.831
before that night.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.533
You knew that they were lovers,
didn't you?

35:01.567 --> 35:03.335
Come on.

35:03.369 --> 35:05.237
You told Wilcox, right?

35:05.271 --> 35:07.773
I didn't say
anything to him.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.875
Oh, come on, Orville.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.244
Wilcox is on the top
of a hill with a camera

35:12.278 --> 35:13.512
the night that
your boss is going

35:13.545 --> 35:15.414
to have sex with Skylar Wyatt.

35:15.447 --> 35:16.915
Is that just a coincidence?

35:16.948 --> 35:19.918
Look, I didn't tell Wilcox
nothing about Dante and Skylar.

35:19.951 --> 35:20.852
Understand me? Nothing.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.922
All right, why don't
you take a look at this?

35:23.955 --> 35:26.192
'Cause this puts him at your
house the day he was killed.

35:29.761 --> 35:32.931
Yeah, he was there.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.800
But it wasn't to meet me.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.303
So what are you saying,
Dante told him?

35:38.904 --> 35:39.838
Why would Dante do that?

35:41.673 --> 35:44.376
Dante said he was banging
this big pop star.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.245
Only, if no one knows
he's doing her,

35:46.278 --> 35:48.380
what good is it to him?

35:48.414 --> 35:49.648
What are you saying?

35:49.681 --> 35:52.218
He wanted pictures of him
with the girl?

35:52.251 --> 35:54.152
He was using her.

35:55.754 --> 35:57.889
And afterwards, he'd talk trash
about her.

35:57.923 --> 36:01.427
He didn't know her,
he didn't care about her.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.961
Not the way that you did?

36:02.994 --> 36:04.863
She was nice to me.

36:04.896 --> 36:06.398
Dante would leave me
in the kitchen

36:06.432 --> 36:08.200
when he went upstairs
to be with her.

36:08.234 --> 36:10.202
Sometimes she
would come down

36:10.236 --> 36:12.971
and we would talk,
you know.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.673
And then, when she had to leave,

36:14.706 --> 36:16.608
she would tell me
I could help myself to whatever.

36:16.642 --> 36:18.210
And that's when

36:18.244 --> 36:19.311
you found the letters?

36:21.647 --> 36:24.683
I just wanted her to know
that Dante was using her.

36:26.785 --> 36:28.387
I just wanted to scare her.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.389
So you broke into her house.

36:30.422 --> 36:31.790
Just to show her that
she wasn't safe.

36:31.823 --> 36:34.626
You know, that she needed
somebody to protect her...

36:34.660 --> 36:37.529
that she needed me.

36:39.731 --> 36:40.632
You had to kill the photographer

36:40.666 --> 36:41.767
to stop him
from taking those pictures.

36:41.800 --> 36:45.304
No! No.

36:45.337 --> 36:48.607
I wasn't even there
that night.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.842
I couldn't stand to be around
anymore when D was with her.

36:50.876 --> 36:53.845
I was at a club all night.

36:53.879 --> 36:58.650
About a dozen people
can vouch for me.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.886
We want assurances that whatever
is said in this room

37:00.919 --> 37:02.621
remains confidential.

37:02.654 --> 37:03.889
Yeah, well, that's not going
to happen.

37:05.757 --> 37:07.025
Well, then, I'd like
the record to reflect

37:07.058 --> 37:08.026
that we met voluntarily

37:08.059 --> 37:09.795
and that we ended this
meeting the same way.

37:09.828 --> 37:10.896
We're done.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.031
DON: Hold on, counselor.
It's not a question of "if."

37:13.064 --> 37:15.000
We know he told Wilcox.

37:15.033 --> 37:16.568
I mean, you think you're
going have any street cred

37:16.602 --> 37:17.769
when the media finds out

37:17.803 --> 37:19.805
you sold Skylar Wyatt
to the tabloids?

37:19.838 --> 37:23.375
You're taking this
to a new level here, pal.

37:23.409 --> 37:24.810
How's "D Bitch" sound?

37:24.843 --> 37:27.346
Look, you can't prove

37:27.379 --> 37:29.381
that my client was the source
of this tip.

37:29.415 --> 37:31.283
Your client's
cell phone records.

37:31.317 --> 37:32.217
Three phone calls

37:32.250 --> 37:34.520
to Jerry Wilcox
two weeks before the murder.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.589
What happened
that night?

37:37.623 --> 37:39.691
Why didn't you show up
at Skylar's?

37:39.725 --> 37:41.593
I did show up.

37:41.627 --> 37:43.495
It was Skylar who wasn't there.

37:45.731 --> 37:46.998
Yo, you got
my cell phone records.

37:47.032 --> 37:50.869
I called Wilcox from my Hummer
at Skylar's house.

37:50.902 --> 37:53.905
I assume you people can
triangulate the call.

37:53.939 --> 37:55.106
Even if that's true,

37:55.140 --> 37:58.009
it still puts your client
in the vicinity of the murder.

38:02.681 --> 38:03.915
All right, look,

38:03.949 --> 38:05.817
we suspect that

38:05.851 --> 38:08.920
you may eventually find
forensic evidence

38:08.954 --> 38:11.890
that places my client
at the crime scene.

38:11.923 --> 38:13.992
What do you mean,
"at the crime scene"?

38:14.025 --> 38:17.095
I was there...

38:17.128 --> 38:18.530
but I didn't kill him.

38:18.564 --> 38:20.799
He was already dead.

38:20.832 --> 38:23.001
All right, then why don't you
tell us all about it?

38:25.437 --> 38:26.905
I got to Skylar's.

38:26.938 --> 38:28.407
She wasn't home.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.375
I waited.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.677
And then I tried
to call Wilcox to tell him

38:31.710 --> 38:33.779
it wasn't going to happen,
and I didn't get an answer.

38:33.812 --> 38:36.081
So I drove up to Mulholland
where he was supposed to be.

38:36.114 --> 38:39.585
He was just laying
on the ground.

38:39.618 --> 38:41.687
I could tell
he wasn't breathing.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.523
So you just took off?

38:44.556 --> 38:46.992
I'm the one who had him up
on that hill.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.627
I wanted those photographs
to be seen.

38:48.660 --> 38:49.828
Now why the hell
would I kill him

38:49.861 --> 38:51.129
to stop him from taking them?

38:51.162 --> 38:53.932
I don't know,
but we're going to find out.

38:55.867 --> 38:56.768
Skylar...

38:56.802 --> 39:00.572
Hello. Can you give me
a second, please?

39:00.606 --> 39:01.640
Have you learned
anything new?

39:01.673 --> 39:03.909
Yeah, why don't we
step over here?

39:03.942 --> 39:05.611
Just spoke to Dante.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.613
Claims he was at your house
the night of the murder.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.915
Only he says
you weren't there.

39:09.948 --> 39:10.982
Well, maybe I didn't hear him.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.585
I told you I was tired
that night.

39:13.619 --> 39:15.120
He also tipped Wilcox off
about the two of you.

39:16.922 --> 39:19.991
I can't say you look
very surprised, Skylar.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.893
You know he called
five magazines that day,

39:21.927 --> 39:23.829
trying to start a bidding war
for those pictures?

39:23.862 --> 39:26.632
MEGAN:
You did know that, didn't you?

39:26.665 --> 39:29.067
Because one of those magazines
is where your friend works.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.903
And she called you and told you
what he was planning.

39:31.937 --> 39:34.573
We traced the call, Skylar.

39:39.445 --> 39:42.681
You have any idea
what it's like to be sold?

39:44.916 --> 39:45.684
To know that

39:45.717 --> 39:49.755
the man
that you thought loved you

39:49.788 --> 39:54.426
had arranged to sell photos
of... you and him having sex?

39:58.497 --> 40:00.165
So you were up there that night?

40:02.934 --> 40:05.637
I found Wilcox,

40:05.671 --> 40:07.573
and I told him

40:07.606 --> 40:10.476
that I thought what he was doing
was despicable.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.479
Know what he did?

40:13.512 --> 40:16.915
He started
snapping photos of me.

40:18.216 --> 40:19.951
So I grabbed his camera

40:19.985 --> 40:25.857
and... he fell to the ground.

40:25.891 --> 40:27.926
And he grabbed my ankle
and he wouldn't let go.

40:29.695 --> 40:32.631
So I picked up
his tripod...

40:37.102 --> 40:38.870
and I hit him over the head.

40:40.972 --> 40:42.974
He was just
laying there.

40:43.008 --> 40:45.877
He was just moaning,
trying to move.

40:47.913 --> 40:50.248
I ran.

40:54.119 --> 40:55.120
These people try

40:55.153 --> 40:56.855
to justify what they're doing

40:56.888 --> 41:00.726
by claiming that
it's the price of fame.

41:00.759 --> 41:03.161
Now one of them has
to pay for a change.

41:07.098 --> 41:10.769
Skylar, I need you to put
your hands behind your back.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.105
Let's go.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.908
Turn around.

41:16.942 --> 41:20.111
( handcuffs clicking )

41:20.145 --> 41:23.849
I can't retrofit a 1931 car
with seat belts.

41:23.882 --> 41:24.783
Why not?

41:24.816 --> 41:26.184
Because it's not authentic
to the period.

41:26.217 --> 41:27.185
Well, I know that.

41:27.218 --> 41:27.919
What I meant was,
it's authentic to this period.

41:27.953 --> 41:29.555
It's totally
physics, Larry.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.923
I mean, without
a seat belt,

41:31.957 --> 41:33.892
you could get hurt
even in a minor accident.

41:33.925 --> 41:34.993
Look, if I'm in an accident
in that car,

41:35.026 --> 41:36.595
I hope I don't survive.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.263
Look, it's a love affair,
me and that car.

41:38.296 --> 41:39.497
With affairs of the heart,

41:39.531 --> 41:42.801
you know, sometimes common sense
gets thrown out the window.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.603
Yeah, or through the windshield.

41:44.636 --> 41:46.605
Hey, speaking of affairs of the
heart, did you ever find out

41:46.638 --> 41:47.739
who sent you
that anonymous note?

41:47.773 --> 41:48.774
Oh, yeah, I was wondering
about that.

41:48.807 --> 41:49.775
No, not yet.

41:49.808 --> 41:50.776
I think we could run

41:50.809 --> 41:51.910
a handwriting analysis against

41:51.943 --> 41:53.545
the school's records office.

41:53.579 --> 41:56.948
You know what? I've decided
I don't need to know.

41:56.982 --> 41:58.283
-Oh, yes, you do.
-Whoever it was,

41:58.316 --> 41:59.818
they chose not to sign it,

41:59.851 --> 42:03.021
maybe because they're
just not ready to tell me.

42:03.054 --> 42:04.656
Well, I think that's very wise.

42:04.690 --> 42:06.692
Let your life retain
some mystery.

42:06.725 --> 42:09.628
Yeah. Besides, you haven't
figured out what to do

42:09.661 --> 42:11.930
with the girl
you already know about.
