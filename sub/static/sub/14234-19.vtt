Previously on
<i>The Event...</i>

00:01.563 --> 00:03.413
The sooner we find
the weapon and use it,

00:03.469 --> 00:05.271
the sooner
our people will be safe.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.405
What the hell
happened to them?

00:06.473 --> 00:08.391
- The virus was alive.
- It was the flu--

00:08.475 --> 00:09.592
Spanish flu.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.043
The lungs are missing.
Where are they?

00:11.094 --> 00:12.378
Must be on the way
to the airport.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.213
With a courier named Alex.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.714
Flight 38, Aero Moscow.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.316
Is this your idea
of loyalty?

00:17.384 --> 00:18.885
I'll never go along
with genocide.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.753
If you aren't with us,
then you're against us.

00:20.821 --> 00:22.738
Take him.
She made a call

00:22.823 --> 00:23.773
through the outside.
She called 911!

00:23.857 --> 00:26.092
No, Luis,
it's all right.

00:26.159 --> 00:28.060
Leila,
you are not one of them.

00:28.128 --> 00:29.462
We're your people now.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.098
Follow my instructions,
and by this time tomorrow,

00:32.165 --> 00:34.083
you'll be leader
of the free world.

00:35.335 --> 00:36.735
Are you all right,
Mr. President?

00:36.787 --> 00:38.170
The President
has suffered a stroke.

00:38.238 --> 00:39.505
Jarvis
may be responsible

00:39.573 --> 00:40.940
for what's happened
to the President.

00:41.008 --> 00:42.942
You have to help me
stop this succession.

00:43.010 --> 00:44.010
To take him down,

00:44.077 --> 00:45.912
you would need
irrefutable proof.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.630
It's gotta be the coffee.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.015
The packet
must've contained the poison.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.283
We'll need more
than surveillance footage

00:50.350 --> 00:51.617
to convince the rest of
the President's Cabinet

00:51.685 --> 00:53.452
of any wrongdoing.
If there are no objections,

00:53.520 --> 00:54.687
I'll commence the vote
to appoint Raymond Jarvis

00:54.755 --> 00:56.355
as acting President.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.090
Elias. Help!

01:05.983 --> 01:07.599
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:07.651 --> 01:10.436
can I have your attention?

01:17.327 --> 01:20.179
- Chief Justice.
- Mr. Vice President.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.782
Are you ready
to be sworn in?

01:22.849 --> 01:24.684
I'm ready.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.820
Please place
your left hand on the Bible.

01:27.888 --> 01:31.057
Raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.012
- Pupil's blown on left.
- Bp dropping. 80 over 40.

01:36.096 --> 01:39.015
- 10 of mannitol.
- What's happening to him?

01:39.099 --> 01:41.183
He's showing signs of
elevated pressure in his brain.

01:41.268 --> 01:44.136
- HR 42 and dropping.
- Where the hell is neurosurge?

01:44.187 --> 01:46.188
He's losing his gag reflex.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.190
Elias!

01:48.275 --> 01:49.692
Ma'am, wait outside.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.310
I, state your name...

01:51.361 --> 01:54.046
I, Raymond Theodore Jarvis...

01:54.114 --> 01:56.248
Do solemnly affirm

01:56.316 --> 01:58.084
that I will
faithfully execute

01:58.151 --> 02:01.354
the office of the President
of the United States.

02:01.421 --> 02:02.855
Do solemnly affirm

02:02.923 --> 02:04.824
that I will
faithfully execute

02:04.891 --> 02:07.827
the office of the President
of the United States.

02:08.929 --> 02:09.862
Ventricular occlusion.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.013
We need to drain.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.865
Mark it
at 5 1/2 centimeters

02:12.933 --> 02:14.867
above the C-1 vertebrae.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.869
Drill.
Prep the endoscope.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.938
I'm going through
the fourth ventricle.

02:19.006 --> 02:21.107
And will,
to the best of my ability,

02:21.174 --> 02:23.709
preserve,
protect, and defend

02:23.777 --> 02:26.746
the constitution
of the United States.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.115
- Ventricular catheter?
- In.

02:29.182 --> 02:31.283
No CSF flow.
Must be kinked.

02:31.351 --> 02:32.568
The catheter's open
and flushes well.

02:32.652 --> 02:33.953
There's no fluid.
There's nothing there.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.355
What's happening?

02:36.406 --> 02:37.590
ICP increasing.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.076
That's not possible.
There's no CSF.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.578
V-tach! We lost the pulse!
We lost the pulse!

02:42.662 --> 02:44.296
And to the best
of my ability,

02:44.364 --> 02:48.050
I will preserve,
protect, and defend

02:48.135 --> 02:51.220
the constitution
of the United States.

02:51.304 --> 02:53.606
- So help me God.
- So help me God.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.976
Mr. President.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.811
Thank you,
Chief Justice.

03:19.507 --> 03:21.258
Another mg of epi.
Chase it with lido.

03:21.343 --> 03:23.611
Going again. Clear!

03:23.678 --> 03:26.263
Wait. We got a pulse.

03:30.635 --> 03:31.585
Doctor...

03:31.636 --> 03:33.103
Pupils fixed and dilated.

03:35.390 --> 03:37.157
Let's do Q 5 neuro checks.
What's his EEG look like?

03:37.225 --> 03:39.326
Wave amplitude
is diminished

03:39.394 --> 03:40.527
and markedly flattened.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.279
He's lapsed into a coma.

03:50.038 --> 03:52.339
This is the scene
outside Bethesda Hospital today,

03:52.407 --> 03:54.208
as Americans
pray and leave flowers

03:54.276 --> 03:56.877
for their fallen leader,
President Elias Martinez.

03:56.944 --> 03:58.045
The White House confirmed

03:58.112 --> 03:59.663
that Martinez
slipped into a coma

03:59.748 --> 04:01.548
as the result of what
his doctors are describing

04:01.616 --> 04:03.484
as a severe stroke.

04:03.551 --> 04:06.353
Shortly thereafter,
Vice President Raymond Jarvis

04:06.421 --> 04:09.223
was sworn in as acting President
of the United States.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.025
He takes the reins
of a country

04:11.092 --> 04:13.427
still reeling from
the first terrorist attack

04:13.495 --> 04:15.629
to take place
on its soil since 9/11--

04:15.697 --> 04:16.863
the destruction
of the Washington Monument.

04:16.930 --> 04:18.832
I heard you need
to be fed and watered.

04:18.899 --> 04:21.819
What happened
to President Martinez?

04:21.903 --> 04:22.836
Quiet.

04:22.904 --> 04:24.705
It's not a coincidence.

04:24.773 --> 04:27.975
Sophia did this,
didn't she?

04:29.477 --> 04:31.245
It's a disgrace.

04:31.313 --> 04:32.997
Martinez was a good man.

04:33.081 --> 04:34.848
Sophia takes no pleasure
in doing this.

04:34.916 --> 04:36.483
She's doing what she has to
to save us.

04:36.551 --> 04:38.018
Yeah,
by committing genocide.

04:38.086 --> 04:39.753
We need to make room.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.823
You need to look at
how she's changed.

04:42.891 --> 04:45.726
Killing her former friends,

04:45.794 --> 04:47.528
turning against her own.

04:47.595 --> 04:49.530
How do you know
you won't be next?

04:49.597 --> 04:53.334
- I'm not a traitor.
- No, you're worse.

04:53.401 --> 04:56.070
You're just blindly
following her.

04:56.137 --> 04:57.571
A sheep.
Shut up.

04:57.639 --> 04:59.273
- A coward.
- I said shut up!

05:01.000 --> 05:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:23.331 --> 05:26.734
Accept the inevitable.

05:28.636 --> 05:31.405
The native population
is done.

05:31.473 --> 05:32.856
They don't have a chance.

05:32.941 --> 05:36.026
Don't underestimate them.

05:36.111 --> 05:38.245
Man, you're
behind the times, man.

05:38.313 --> 05:41.382
They've all but surrendered.

05:41.449 --> 05:44.401
Sophia's calling the shots
with the White House now.

05:44.486 --> 05:47.020
What are you
talking about?

05:47.072 --> 05:48.855
Before we begin,

05:48.907 --> 05:50.857
I'd like to acknowledge
the tragedy

05:50.909 --> 05:53.460
that has befallen us.

05:53.528 --> 05:54.661
As we sit here,

05:54.729 --> 05:57.731
Elias Martinez
is fighting for his life.

05:57.799 --> 06:01.885
In the short time
he was President,

06:01.970 --> 06:03.887
he made an indelible mark.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.739
And I serve
in the shadow of the honesty

06:05.807 --> 06:09.543
and integrity
that exemplified his term.

06:09.611 --> 06:13.680
Now to the business at hand.

06:15.233 --> 06:19.069
We are at war,
ladies and gentlemen,

06:19.154 --> 06:22.156
and the time has come
for us to be realistic

06:22.223 --> 06:23.457
about our enemy.

06:25.026 --> 06:29.763
Fact--Sophia and her people
have unbridled power,

06:29.831 --> 06:32.232
weapons they are willing
to use against us

06:32.300 --> 06:36.303
that we don't even understand
and cannot defend against.

06:36.371 --> 06:39.640
The truth is,
if we want to survive,

06:39.707 --> 06:42.443
a radical change in strategy
is called for.

06:42.510 --> 06:44.711
Meaning what?

06:49.717 --> 06:52.686
Meaning we are going to open
diplomatic channels with Sophia

06:52.754 --> 06:55.105
and begin negotiating
a peace.

06:55.190 --> 06:56.440
What?

06:56.524 --> 06:58.025
Sir, don't you think
we're a little past

06:58.092 --> 06:59.359
the point of negotiation?

06:59.427 --> 07:00.594
I don't.

07:00.662 --> 07:02.262
If we wanna bring them
to the table,

07:02.330 --> 07:03.864
we have to show
good faith,

07:03.932 --> 07:05.199
we have to stop
hounding them

07:05.266 --> 07:07.034
and stop treating them
like an enemy.

07:07.101 --> 07:08.869
Effective immediately,

07:08.937 --> 07:11.572
all military
and intelligence personnel

07:11.639 --> 07:13.740
who have been pursuing
Sophia and her people

07:13.808 --> 07:15.209
will cease and desist.

07:15.276 --> 07:17.127
You can't be serious.

07:17.212 --> 07:20.347
We still have no idea
what they may be planning.

07:20.415 --> 07:22.082
And whose fault is that?

07:26.087 --> 07:28.388
This is our new policy--

07:28.456 --> 07:31.892
letting them
live in peace...

07:31.959 --> 07:35.095
So that we
may do the same.

07:40.969 --> 07:43.403
Makes me sick seeing him
at the head of that table.

07:43.471 --> 07:44.738
He's all but murdered
the President,

07:44.806 --> 07:46.139
and now he's destroying
any chance we have

07:46.191 --> 07:47.441
of recapturing Sophia.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.077
I know you believe
Jarvis poisoned Martinez,

07:50.144 --> 07:52.746
but without evidence,
we can't act on that knowledge.

07:52.814 --> 07:54.047
I may have it.

07:55.700 --> 07:56.984
What do you mean?

07:57.051 --> 07:59.653
After the Cabinet meeting
last night,

07:59.704 --> 08:01.488
I noticed some
of Martinez's coffee

08:01.556 --> 08:03.323
had spilled
onto my shirt cuff.

08:03.391 --> 08:04.658
Enough to analyze?

08:04.709 --> 08:06.710
Yeah, I sent it off
to the lab this morning.

08:06.794 --> 08:08.896
If the tox screen
comes back positive,

08:08.963 --> 08:11.465
we can start to build a case
against Jarvis.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.302
Let's hope it does.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.671
Until then, let's not forget
he's acting President.

08:17.739 --> 08:19.506
It's our sworn duty
to follow his orders.

08:19.574 --> 08:22.526
We have to stand down
against Sophia.

08:25.780 --> 08:27.047
And who's watching
Simon now?

08:27.115 --> 08:29.116
Jason and Cameron.
I'm going back there now.

08:29.183 --> 08:31.285
I just wanted to tell you
what he did myself.

08:32.687 --> 08:34.871
I'll deal with it.

08:36.124 --> 08:37.541
Aaron, please tell me

08:37.625 --> 08:39.458
things are progressing well
on your end.

08:39.527 --> 08:41.128
They are.
Our tests confirmed

08:41.195 --> 08:42.379
that the body we excavated

08:42.462 --> 08:44.581
is still rife
with the strain of the virus.

08:44.666 --> 08:46.333
- Good.
- There was a complication.

08:46.384 --> 08:48.802
The men we hired to dissect
the lungs from the body,

08:48.870 --> 08:51.305
they were
accidentally exposed.

08:51.372 --> 08:53.774
Everyone on the ship died
within several hours.

08:53.841 --> 08:55.275
This strain works
even more quickly

08:55.343 --> 08:56.977
than we'd anticipated.

08:57.045 --> 08:58.645
That could be a problem.

08:58.713 --> 09:00.814
We'll need to run more tests
on the lung tissue

09:00.882 --> 09:01.949
as soon as it gets here.

09:02.016 --> 09:03.150
Where is it now?

09:03.217 --> 09:04.885
In a temperature-controlled
container.

09:04.953 --> 09:06.386
Our courier
is hand-carrying it

09:06.454 --> 09:07.888
onto the flight
right as we speak.

09:07.956 --> 09:10.390
The plane is on its way
from Moscow to New York.

09:10.458 --> 09:11.725
And you're confident
this courier

09:11.793 --> 09:13.794
is capable
of seeing this through?

09:13.861 --> 09:16.913
Alex can be trusted.

09:21.536 --> 09:23.620
You think we'll be getting
off the ground on time?

09:23.705 --> 09:26.957
We're running
right on schedule, sir.

09:27.041 --> 09:29.242
You sure you don't want
to check your suitcase?

09:29.294 --> 09:31.478
I can take it here.
It will be waiting for you--

09:31.546 --> 09:34.214
No, I'm fine.

09:47.829 --> 09:49.980
Do you speak English?

09:50.064 --> 09:51.865
Yes, some.

09:51.933 --> 09:54.668
Um, Flight 38
to New York.

09:57.905 --> 10:00.240
Boarding
is almost completed.

10:00.291 --> 10:01.441
The flight is closing.

10:01.509 --> 10:03.543
We just need to see
if our friend, uh,

10:03.611 --> 10:05.145
Alex is on board.

10:05.213 --> 10:06.313
You understand
I am not allowed

10:06.381 --> 10:08.015
to give out
that information.

10:08.082 --> 10:10.417
Please,
it's very important.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.786
We just need to know
if he got on the plane.

10:12.854 --> 10:14.388
I'm sorry.

10:16.691 --> 10:19.159
Are there still seats?

10:19.227 --> 10:20.994
A minute.

10:22.563 --> 10:23.897
What are you doing?

10:23.964 --> 10:25.232
The flight's boarded.

10:25.299 --> 10:26.400
If we wanna stop
the courier,

10:26.467 --> 10:27.768
then we have
to get on the plane.

10:27.819 --> 10:30.470
If we let that courier
deliver the virus to Sophia,

10:30.521 --> 10:32.906
she'll use it against us.
You saw what that virus does.

10:32.974 --> 10:34.041
- Yeah.
- I don't wanna be stuck

10:34.108 --> 10:36.660
on a plane with a WMD
for 11 hours.

10:36.744 --> 10:39.863
Then don't come with me.

10:39.947 --> 10:41.281
I do have tickets
available,

10:41.332 --> 10:42.749
but the flight is closing.

10:42.817 --> 10:45.952
- Okay, one ticket, please.
- Passport, please.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.861
Make that two.

10:57.432 --> 10:59.332
And don't look
so damn surprised.

11:01.469 --> 11:03.403
Hold on, wait!

11:09.844 --> 11:12.946
Take your seats.
We're leaving now.

11:13.013 --> 11:14.614
Thank you.

12:26.117 --> 12:27.918
I got
the passenger manifest.

12:27.986 --> 12:30.254
And?

12:30.321 --> 12:32.356
There's no "Alex" on board.

12:32.423 --> 12:33.757
I checked first
and last names.

12:33.825 --> 12:37.210
Nothing's even close.
Look.

12:38.796 --> 12:39.930
So "Alex"
is either a nickname,

12:39.998 --> 12:41.331
or the courier's
not on the flight.

12:41.399 --> 12:44.067
But either way,
we're screwed.

12:44.135 --> 12:46.403
Do you see
this empty seat up here?

12:46.471 --> 12:48.138
I've been watching
the guy sitting in it.

12:48.206 --> 12:50.374
He's acting real weird.
He keeps looking around.

12:50.441 --> 12:52.409
And don't make it obvious
you're looking,

12:52.477 --> 12:55.612
but he's on his way back
from the bathroom.

13:00.268 --> 13:03.186
Who brings their carry-on
to the bathroom?

13:05.123 --> 13:06.657
You think
the infected tissue's in it?

13:06.724 --> 13:08.392
It's the right size.

13:08.459 --> 13:10.093
And he never lets it
out of his sight.

13:10.161 --> 13:12.095
It's suspect, but--

13:12.163 --> 13:14.064
but we can't be sure
it's him.

13:14.132 --> 13:16.366
Yeah, but we can't do--
we can't do nothing, either.

13:44.796 --> 13:45.929
Blake.

13:56.441 --> 13:58.675
How is he?

13:58.743 --> 14:01.161
It's not good.

14:03.848 --> 14:06.149
He slipped into a coma
after the surgery.

14:06.217 --> 14:08.218
The doctors don't know
what triggered it.

14:08.286 --> 14:10.170
But they said if he doesn't
come out of it soon...

14:10.254 --> 14:12.289
No, come on,
don't even think like that.

14:12.357 --> 14:14.124
This stroke,
it just...

14:14.192 --> 14:15.726
Came out of nowhere.

14:15.793 --> 14:17.227
I keep thinking
it must've been

14:17.295 --> 14:18.962
because of the stress
he's been under.

14:19.030 --> 14:21.464
I should've done something

14:21.516 --> 14:23.633
to make him
try and deal with it.

14:23.701 --> 14:26.303
Christina,
this isn't your fault.

14:26.371 --> 14:29.740
Nothing you did
could've helped him.

14:32.744 --> 14:35.846
What do you mean
by that?

14:35.913 --> 14:37.514
Nothing.

14:37.582 --> 14:40.517
What do you know?

14:40.585 --> 14:44.354
Look, I just mean
Elias would be heartbroken

14:44.422 --> 14:46.990
if he thought you were taking
this out on yourself.

14:47.058 --> 14:49.826
I'm sorry.

14:49.894 --> 14:51.561
I know you, Blake.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.847
There's something
you're hiding from me,

14:53.931 --> 14:55.399
isn't there?

14:55.466 --> 14:57.000
Blake.
I'm sorry.

14:57.068 --> 15:00.537
- I need to know.
- I'm sorry.

15:00.605 --> 15:03.073
You're mistaken.

15:06.043 --> 15:08.695
Martinez will never recover
from his coma.

15:08.780 --> 15:11.198
The compound has already slowed
his brain function.

15:11.282 --> 15:14.701
Soon it will stop them
altogether.

15:14.786 --> 15:17.087
How much time
does he have?

15:17.155 --> 15:18.588
That depends on
how much he's ingested.

15:18.656 --> 15:20.290
Later today or tomorrow.

15:20.358 --> 15:23.059
No longer than that.

15:25.630 --> 15:26.797
Dr. Lu.

15:26.864 --> 15:28.865
I hope
I'm not interrupting.

15:28.933 --> 15:30.534
Not at all.
Dr. Lu was just assuring me

15:30.601 --> 15:32.502
that the crisis
surrounding Martinez

15:32.570 --> 15:34.404
will be over soon.
Thank you.

15:34.472 --> 15:36.039
Of course.

15:45.650 --> 15:47.083
I came as soon as
I got your message.

15:47.151 --> 15:48.552
What's wrong?

15:52.190 --> 15:55.125
Do you know
what scares me the most?

15:55.193 --> 15:56.560
No. What?

15:58.629 --> 16:01.898
The letting go...

16:01.966 --> 16:04.534
of who I used to be.

16:06.771 --> 16:09.039
I knew that
it would be painful

16:09.090 --> 16:11.875
to follow through
on Thomas' plan,

16:11.926 --> 16:13.960
that in order to make room
for our people here

16:14.045 --> 16:15.312
to ensure their survival,

16:15.379 --> 16:17.647
I would have to...

16:17.715 --> 16:19.816
Sacrifice some
of my principles.

16:19.884 --> 16:21.485
Well, you've taken
a huge burden

16:21.552 --> 16:23.787
on your shoulders,
Sophia.

16:25.356 --> 16:26.456
But that doesn't make

16:26.524 --> 16:29.392
what needs to happen next
any easier.

16:30.962 --> 16:32.896
That's the reason
I've asked you here.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.934
This morning
Simon attacked Carlos

16:38.002 --> 16:40.637
in the infirmary,
and he nearly escaped.

16:42.006 --> 16:43.607
We need to move him
to a more secure location.

16:43.674 --> 16:44.841
No.

16:44.909 --> 16:48.845
I was hoping that Simon
would soften his views,

16:48.913 --> 16:52.516
that we'd be able to welcome him
back into the fold,

16:52.583 --> 16:55.285
but it's clear to me now

16:55.353 --> 16:58.288
that that will never happen.

17:02.193 --> 17:04.794
He needs
to be taken care of.

17:06.696 --> 17:07.964
You want him killed?

17:08.031 --> 17:09.632
He would've turned us in
to the authorities.

17:09.684 --> 17:12.969
Can you imagine
what they would do to us now?

17:14.638 --> 17:16.705
Will you help me?

17:16.773 --> 17:20.042
- Why me?
- You've always been loyal.

17:20.111 --> 17:22.712
Michael,
you've been able to--

17:22.780 --> 17:26.082
to set aside your--
your attachments.

17:26.150 --> 17:28.151
My attachments.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.488
You've never let your feelings
about your family

17:31.556 --> 17:36.026
get in the way
of what needs to be done.

17:38.596 --> 17:41.498
You will do this for me.

17:44.535 --> 17:45.802
Yes.

17:59.784 --> 18:03.453
- Oh! I'm so sorry!
- What are you doing?

18:03.520 --> 18:05.739
I'm so sorry.
Let me get you a napkin.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.991
No, I'm fine,
I'm fine.

18:36.020 --> 18:38.588
We got the wrong guy.

18:38.656 --> 18:40.907
It's coke.

18:49.233 --> 18:52.836
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

18:52.903 --> 18:54.004
Yeah.

18:54.071 --> 18:55.255
Yeah, everything's fine.

19:14.394 --> 19:15.828
We're out of moves, Sean.

19:15.866 --> 19:17.050
We don't know
who the courier is

19:17.135 --> 19:18.402
or if he's even
on this plane.

19:18.469 --> 19:19.636
The courier
is on this plane.

19:19.704 --> 19:21.104
We have to assume that.

19:21.172 --> 19:22.372
- Or what?
- Or Sophia gets the virus,

19:22.440 --> 19:24.207
and then there's
no hope for anybody.

19:25.927 --> 19:27.144
We have to let
the authorities know

19:27.211 --> 19:28.929
that there's a WMD
on this flight.

19:28.997 --> 19:30.263
How?

19:30.331 --> 19:31.932
You worked for the CIA.
You have to know someone

19:32.000 --> 19:33.433
we can get word to, right?

19:33.501 --> 19:35.936
Say I do.

19:36.020 --> 19:38.455
Think about
what's gonna happen.

19:38.523 --> 19:41.274
Well, they divert the plane,
land, and quarantine it

19:41.359 --> 19:43.560
until they find the courier
and what he's carrying.

19:43.628 --> 19:45.729
What happens to us?

19:45.797 --> 19:48.098
As soon as the courier
figures out what's going on,

19:48.166 --> 19:50.801
he could release the virus,
infect this entire plane,

19:50.868 --> 19:52.919
before or after we land.

19:53.004 --> 19:54.438
Do you wanna die
like that?

19:54.505 --> 19:57.107
At least the virus
would be contained.

19:57.175 --> 20:00.177
Now are you gonna tell me
who I can get this message to

20:00.244 --> 20:01.678
or not?

20:06.984 --> 20:08.952
I know someone
at Homeland.

20:09.020 --> 20:10.654
Thank you.

20:15.526 --> 20:17.961
Look, I know--

20:18.029 --> 20:20.964
I know it's taken me
a while to stop...

20:21.032 --> 20:24.134
being surprised
you're willing to help me...

20:24.202 --> 20:25.335
of your own free will

20:25.403 --> 20:29.172
and--and for me
to realize that

20:29.240 --> 20:34.678
you're doing this,
at least in part,

20:34.746 --> 20:37.414
because of me.

20:42.019 --> 20:44.621
It was just hard
for me to believe.

20:46.124 --> 20:49.326
And why is that?

20:49.394 --> 20:51.828
Because of...

20:54.298 --> 20:57.667
You understand.
Because of who you are.

20:57.735 --> 20:59.736
- Who am I, Sean?
- You know what I mean.

20:59.804 --> 21:03.073
No. No, I don't.
Why don't you tell me.

21:03.141 --> 21:06.710
When I first met you,
I was your target.

21:06.778 --> 21:08.678
I watched you kill people.

21:08.746 --> 21:11.248
- And now you've done the same.
- No, it's not.

21:11.315 --> 21:13.450
It's not the same.

21:16.053 --> 21:18.221
Look, this isn't
where I meant for this to go.

21:18.289 --> 21:20.257
I was trying to thank...
Oh, forget it, Sean.

21:20.324 --> 21:21.858
And don't
flatter yourself, okay?

21:21.926 --> 21:23.326
You're just
a means to an end.

21:23.394 --> 21:25.662
I'm doing this
to protect my family,

21:25.730 --> 21:27.497
the people that I love.

21:30.968 --> 21:32.052
Now give me the laptop.

21:32.136 --> 21:34.237
I'll email my contact.

21:53.908 --> 21:55.692
I found
a place to bury Luis.

21:55.743 --> 21:57.861
About a mile
into the woods.

21:57.912 --> 21:59.763
The ground is soft.
No trails.

21:59.831 --> 22:01.465
And no one saw you?

22:01.532 --> 22:03.433
- I was careful.
- All right.

22:03.501 --> 22:04.901
We'll wait
until tonight, then.

22:04.969 --> 22:07.370
I'll be back.

22:07.438 --> 22:08.939
We can bury Luis,

22:09.006 --> 22:12.409
but what are you gonna do
with everyone else?

22:12.477 --> 22:14.744
How many innocent people

22:14.812 --> 22:17.213
does Sophia plan
on killing?

22:17.265 --> 22:18.715
I mean, is there gonna be
anyone left?

22:18.766 --> 22:20.217
Leila, not now.

22:20.284 --> 22:21.751
You don't wanna talk
about this,

22:21.819 --> 22:23.320
because you know
that it's wrong.

22:23.387 --> 22:25.422
Our people
have nowhere to go.

22:25.490 --> 22:26.723
So it's okay
to commit mass murder.

22:26.774 --> 22:28.225
I don't like doing
what we have to do

22:28.292 --> 22:31.094
any more than you do,
but it's us or them.

22:33.664 --> 22:35.749
Now I have to go.

22:35.833 --> 22:38.752
When I was a kid,

22:38.836 --> 22:41.671
I was playing with the boys
across the street,

22:41.739 --> 22:43.840
and they killed a bird.

22:43.908 --> 22:46.610
I told you what happened,

22:46.677 --> 22:49.963
and you said
we were the strongest

22:50.047 --> 22:51.815
and smartest things
on the planet,

22:51.883 --> 22:53.817
so we had
a responsibility

22:53.885 --> 22:55.986
to protect
the smaller, weaker things,

22:56.053 --> 22:57.988
because if we didn't do it,
then no one else would,

22:58.055 --> 23:00.957
that it was
the right thing to do.

23:01.025 --> 23:02.626
I don't know
if you remember that,

23:02.693 --> 23:05.462
but I do.

23:05.530 --> 23:07.964
And I'm looking at you,

23:08.032 --> 23:11.101
and I don't recognize
that person anymore.

23:23.347 --> 23:25.081
Sir?

23:25.149 --> 23:28.001
Dr. Narducci, come in.

23:28.085 --> 23:31.221
I have the preliminary results
of the analysis you requested.

23:31.288 --> 23:32.489
I've kept it quiet
just like you asked.

23:32.557 --> 23:33.723
Close the door, please.

23:35.293 --> 23:37.561
The sample
on the shirt you gave me

23:37.628 --> 23:40.163
contained coffee
and sucralose,

23:40.231 --> 23:42.298
which is a very common
sugar substitute.

23:42.350 --> 23:47.671
But I also found traces
of an unknown biocatalyst.

23:47.738 --> 23:49.472
A biocatalyst?

23:49.540 --> 23:50.640
It's not something
naturally occurring.

23:50.691 --> 23:53.810
It was synthesized,
which is strange,

23:53.878 --> 23:55.745
because as far as I know,

23:55.813 --> 23:58.481
we don't even have
the science to create it.

24:00.551 --> 24:03.553
I'm sorry, but I don't have
a better explanation.

24:07.325 --> 24:09.726
I think I do.

24:20.371 --> 24:22.739
Blake, what is it?

24:22.807 --> 24:24.741
We need to talk.

24:24.809 --> 24:27.377
Can it wait
until tomorrow?

24:27.445 --> 24:30.864
I don't think what happened
to the President

24:30.948 --> 24:33.016
was an accident.

24:35.820 --> 24:38.755
Not an accident?

24:38.823 --> 24:40.290
Well, he had a stroke.

24:40.358 --> 24:43.093
Never felt right to me.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.428
Well, I know it's hard
to accept tragedy

24:45.496 --> 24:47.731
when it strikes
out of the blue like that...

24:47.798 --> 24:50.050
I knew things
just weren't as they seemed.

24:50.134 --> 24:51.568
I knew it in my bones.

24:53.137 --> 24:55.405
So I thought I'd get
a sample of the coffee

24:55.473 --> 24:57.407
the President was drinking
that morning

24:57.475 --> 24:58.775
and have it tested.

24:58.843 --> 25:00.744
- A sample.
- Yes.

25:00.811 --> 25:03.513
Some of it spilled
on my clothes.

25:06.517 --> 25:09.619
So you really
do suspect foul play.

25:09.687 --> 25:12.722
There was foul play.

25:12.790 --> 25:17.394
The lab found traces
of an unknown compound.

25:19.130 --> 25:21.114
Well, you should've come
to me with this.

25:21.198 --> 25:22.799
I'm telling you now.

25:23.868 --> 25:25.835
I have reason to believe

25:25.903 --> 25:28.338
the compound came
from Sophia's people.

25:28.406 --> 25:29.639
Is that right.

25:29.707 --> 25:34.144
And once I realized
Sophia was involved...

25:34.211 --> 25:36.079
It all finally
made sense to me.

25:36.147 --> 25:37.764
Meaning...

25:37.848 --> 25:39.450
What?

25:39.517 --> 25:40.951
Meaning you're
not capable

25:41.019 --> 25:44.054
of doing something like this
alone, Raymond.

25:44.122 --> 25:45.956
How--

25:46.024 --> 25:50.110
how dare you
accuse me of being--

25:50.195 --> 25:51.612
I know you poisoned
the President.

25:51.696 --> 25:53.396
I know you're working
with Sophia.

25:53.448 --> 25:54.998
Well, that's preposterous!
Now, you listen to me!

25:55.066 --> 25:57.334
You listen! I don't know
what she promised you

25:57.402 --> 25:59.903
to do what you did,
but she's lying.

25:59.954 --> 26:02.406
The only reason she helped you
get where you are...

26:02.474 --> 26:03.740
Blake, remember
who you're talking to!

26:03.792 --> 26:05.008
Is because she knew
it would give her control

26:05.076 --> 26:06.927
of this office.

26:07.011 --> 26:08.962
You're a pawn, ray.
Her puppet.

26:09.047 --> 26:11.582
That's enough!

26:11.649 --> 26:14.251
Look...

26:14.302 --> 26:17.754
I know you care
about this country...

26:17.822 --> 26:19.756
but trusting Sophia

26:19.824 --> 26:22.292
will only lead to more death
and destruction.

26:22.360 --> 26:25.095
So whatever you're doing,

26:25.163 --> 26:27.431
I'm begging you...

26:27.499 --> 26:30.267
Put an end to it now.

26:30.335 --> 26:32.402
Before it's too late.

26:37.208 --> 26:39.510
Your accusations
are outrageous

26:39.577 --> 26:41.628
and completely baseless.

26:41.713 --> 26:45.148
This is where you and I
part ways.

26:45.216 --> 26:47.184
Your services
are no longer required.

26:47.252 --> 26:50.220
You may tender your resignation
effective immediately.

26:50.288 --> 26:52.623
You're done.

27:24.637 --> 27:27.071
Look.

27:38.350 --> 27:40.768
Ladies and gentlemen,
just to inform you,

27:40.853 --> 27:43.254
we are currently
under military escort.

27:43.322 --> 27:45.657
There is no reason
to be alarmed.

27:45.724 --> 27:47.925
Our flight
is being redirected

27:47.993 --> 27:49.444
to Andrews Air Force Base
in Maryland

27:49.528 --> 27:51.629
only as a safety precaution.

27:51.697 --> 27:54.298
At this time, we ask
that you remain in your seats

27:54.366 --> 27:56.300
with your seatbelts
fastened.

27:56.368 --> 27:57.602
Thank you.

27:57.670 --> 27:59.237
It worked.

27:59.304 --> 28:01.939
Now would be the time
for this guy to make his move.

28:15.587 --> 28:18.690
Sir, please,
you must remain in your seat.

28:18.757 --> 28:20.024
No, I want my wife
next to me.

28:20.092 --> 28:21.425
We were given
separate seats,

28:21.477 --> 28:22.694
but there's no way
I'm staying here

28:22.761 --> 28:25.029
with her up there.

28:25.097 --> 28:26.430
All right.

28:26.482 --> 28:29.333
I'll see what I can do.

28:35.441 --> 28:38.209
- Sophia, we have a problem.
- What?

28:38.277 --> 28:39.711
Our courier
just emailed me.

28:39.778 --> 28:42.446
The plane now
has a U.S. military escort.

28:42.498 --> 28:45.967
Someone told the authorities
there's a WMD on board.

28:46.051 --> 28:47.318
How? Who would know?

28:47.386 --> 28:49.620
Is it possible someone
saw you hand off the case?

28:49.688 --> 28:51.322
- No.
- This could jeopardize

28:51.390 --> 28:52.840
everything that
we've been working towards.

28:52.925 --> 28:54.559
What if we use the virus?

28:54.626 --> 28:56.127
Once they force
the plane to land,

28:56.195 --> 28:58.196
we can expose
everyone on board to it...

28:58.263 --> 28:59.363
No.

28:59.431 --> 29:00.798
No, given what happened
on board the boat,

29:00.866 --> 29:03.634
we now know that
they'd all die immediately.

29:03.702 --> 29:05.470
There wouldn't be time enough
for the virus to spread

29:05.537 --> 29:07.805
as far as we need it to.

29:07.873 --> 29:09.474
So what do we do?

29:11.910 --> 29:13.344
I know that you
and Director Sterling

29:13.412 --> 29:14.712
have grown close.

29:14.780 --> 29:16.881
And as you've
been made aware,

29:16.949 --> 29:18.382
I was forced
to dismiss him.

29:18.450 --> 29:20.318
For insubordination,
no less.

29:20.385 --> 29:22.186
Yes, I heard.

29:22.254 --> 29:24.355
He made some
outrageous allegations,

29:24.423 --> 29:26.023
preposterous allegations

29:26.091 --> 29:29.360
that were absolutely
inexcusable.

29:29.428 --> 29:31.345
Now, I don't know
if he, uh,

29:31.430 --> 29:34.065
shared any
of these notions with you,

29:34.133 --> 29:36.901
but, uh--

29:36.969 --> 29:38.903
but I would never want you
to be swayed

29:38.971 --> 29:40.438
by hearsay.

29:40.506 --> 29:43.674
The man obviously buckled
under the pressure

29:43.742 --> 29:45.510
and stress of his job.

29:45.577 --> 29:46.711
And if you ever felt

29:46.779 --> 29:50.381
as burdened
as Blake must've been...

29:50.449 --> 29:54.418
Please know
that you can come to me.

29:55.954 --> 29:58.756
And...

30:00.576 --> 30:02.526
Understood,
Mr. President.

30:02.578 --> 30:03.628
Thank you.

30:03.695 --> 30:05.630
Thank you.

30:16.275 --> 30:17.575
Hello?

30:17.643 --> 30:21.145
Mr. President,
it's Sophia.

30:21.213 --> 30:24.482
Sophia,
it's good you called,

30:24.549 --> 30:28.252
but I would prefer you use
the formal, diplomatic channels

30:28.320 --> 30:30.254
that we now have
at our disposal.

30:30.322 --> 30:32.290
U.S. fighter jets
are currently escorting

30:32.357 --> 30:34.792
Aero Moscow Flight 38
bound for New York.

30:34.860 --> 30:36.394
I'd like you
to order them

30:36.461 --> 30:39.230
to release their hold
on that plane immediately.

30:39.298 --> 30:41.899
- What?
- You heard me.

30:41.950 --> 30:44.168
Release the plane.

30:44.236 --> 30:46.270
Well, I need to know
what the situation is.

30:46.338 --> 30:48.405
I need to understand
the circumstances.

30:48.457 --> 30:49.907
You don't need
to understand anything.

30:49.975 --> 30:51.676
Just do it.

30:51.743 --> 30:53.177
Sophia,
we have an agreement

30:53.245 --> 30:56.347
based on, uh,
cooperation and trust.

30:56.414 --> 30:58.850
And right now,
you're exhibiting neither.

30:58.917 --> 31:02.653
Look out your window,
Raymond.

31:02.721 --> 31:04.021
Why?

31:04.089 --> 31:05.790
Look at what's left
of the Washington Monument.

31:05.858 --> 31:08.626
Sophia, please.

31:08.694 --> 31:11.462
Call off
those F-16s now,

31:11.530 --> 31:15.299
or I will take action
against your people again

31:15.367 --> 31:17.301
and I will tell
the whole world

31:17.369 --> 31:18.803
about the role you played

31:18.871 --> 31:20.605
in taking down
your predecessor.

31:20.672 --> 31:23.808
Sophia. Sophia!

31:40.926 --> 31:43.361
They're leaving.

31:46.365 --> 31:48.032
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your Captain speaking.

31:48.100 --> 31:49.567
I am happy to report

31:49.635 --> 31:52.987
that the security threat
was proved non-credible,

31:53.071 --> 31:55.072
and the jets flanking
the plane have been called off.

31:55.140 --> 31:56.974
Why would they call them off
before we landed?

31:57.042 --> 31:59.010
I thought your contact
at Homeland was credible.

31:59.077 --> 32:00.678
He is.
Don't you get it?

32:00.746 --> 32:02.980
Sophia must have somebody
on the inside too.

32:03.048 --> 32:04.649
Somebody who intervened
to make sure

32:04.716 --> 32:07.351
that that infected tissue
got off this plane.

32:20.265 --> 32:22.199
Passports, please.

32:22.267 --> 32:24.668
The courier must be
around here somewhere.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.437
Sean, we have
to face the idea

32:26.504 --> 32:27.705
that we might not find him.

32:27.773 --> 32:29.523
- No, we don't.
- So...

32:29.608 --> 32:31.859
- Not yet.
- What do you say, Alexandra?

32:31.944 --> 32:34.011
You want to split a cab?

32:34.079 --> 32:35.579
Sorry, my boyfriend
is picking me up.

32:35.647 --> 32:37.732
- Alexandra.
- That's our flight attendant.

32:37.816 --> 32:41.369
That's why the name
wasn't on the manifest.

32:41.453 --> 32:43.287
- Look.
- Get back in line.

32:43.355 --> 32:44.688
You're not going anywhere

32:44.740 --> 32:46.407
till you have your bags
searched first.

32:46.491 --> 32:48.542
Go.

33:06.375 --> 33:07.809
Director Sterling
has been escorted

33:07.877 --> 33:10.111
out of the White House.

33:11.575 --> 33:14.077
Sir?

33:14.255 --> 33:16.491
You wanted me
to let you know

33:16.540 --> 33:18.908
Director Sterling is gone.

33:20.396 --> 33:22.463
Fine.

33:22.531 --> 33:23.932
That's good.

33:23.999 --> 33:25.934
Thank you.

33:45.988 --> 33:47.772
Michael,
what are you doing here?

33:47.856 --> 33:49.123
Sophia wants me
to take care of things.

33:49.191 --> 33:50.441
You should wait outside.

33:50.526 --> 33:51.659
Well, I don't think
that's a good idea.

33:51.727 --> 33:53.328
Go now.

33:58.667 --> 34:02.870
So Sophia sent you to do
her dirty work for her, huh?

34:09.612 --> 34:12.013
You're going to have
to face up to what you're doing,

34:12.081 --> 34:14.415
Michael, to me

34:14.483 --> 34:17.752
and the billions of people
Sophia will ask you to kill.

34:25.893 --> 34:27.829
Michael.

34:31.766 --> 34:34.034
We gotta get you
out of here.

34:41.909 --> 34:44.245
Give me a hand
with the body.

34:52.954 --> 34:56.391
Sophia must've used
some kind of poison on Martinez.

34:56.458 --> 34:57.992
Do you know of any way
we can help him?

34:58.060 --> 34:59.227
The scientist
who created the poison--

34:59.294 --> 35:01.329
Dr. Lu--is on site.
I'll see what I can do.

35:01.397 --> 35:03.031
You go get Leila.
I'll meet you in the woods

35:03.098 --> 35:05.566
on the northwest side
of the development.

35:05.634 --> 35:08.302
- Go. I got this.
- Okay.

35:26.988 --> 35:28.322
Sean!

35:36.048 --> 35:37.665
Go, go!

36:25.264 --> 36:26.264
Drop it!

36:26.348 --> 36:27.598
Drop it
or I'll kill him!

36:27.683 --> 36:29.884
Don't worry about me!

36:29.935 --> 36:31.069
Take the shot.

36:31.153 --> 36:32.770
Put it down
or he's dead.

36:32.855 --> 36:34.221
Don't worry about me!
Shoot him!

36:34.273 --> 36:35.389
Drop the gun!

36:35.441 --> 36:36.407
You can't let him
take the case!

36:36.492 --> 36:37.775
Drop it! Drop it now!

36:37.860 --> 36:39.193
Vicky, shoot him!
Don't let them take the case!

36:39.244 --> 36:40.745
- I'll kill him.
- Vicky.

36:40.829 --> 36:41.929
I'll kill him!

36:41.997 --> 36:43.281
- Take the shot!
- Drop the gun!

36:43.365 --> 36:46.134
Vicky, please. You can't
let them have the virus.

36:46.201 --> 36:48.603
Down or I'll pull
the trigger!

36:48.670 --> 36:49.904
Vicky!

36:49.955 --> 36:53.091
No!

36:53.175 --> 36:55.643
What are you doing?

36:55.711 --> 36:57.812
Kick it away!

37:01.016 --> 37:02.100
Let's go! Let's go!

37:18.400 --> 37:22.236
Why didn't you
take the shot?

37:28.777 --> 37:31.996
They're getting away.
Come on.

37:32.080 --> 37:33.748
Come on, come on!

38:11.186 --> 38:13.538
Michael? Carlos?

38:23.966 --> 38:27.018
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
I'm good. Just go, just go!

38:41.316 --> 38:43.918
Michael and Simon are gone.
Lock down the perimeter.

38:43.986 --> 38:46.454
We have to find them
before they escape.

39:01.003 --> 39:02.036
Where's my dad?

39:02.104 --> 39:05.106
He said
he'd meet us here.

39:10.312 --> 39:12.380
We can't wait
much longer.

39:24.392 --> 39:26.761
- Dad!
- Oh, sweetheart.

39:31.333 --> 39:34.969
Okay, the perimeter fence
is straight ahead,

39:35.037 --> 39:36.003
about 50 yards
through those trees.

39:36.071 --> 39:38.089
All right.
Let's go.

39:58.994 --> 40:00.895
Get down!

40:02.030 --> 40:03.948
Go! To the left!

40:28.340 --> 40:31.509
Dad!

40:33.061 --> 40:34.294
No, no!

40:34.346 --> 40:35.896
Leila, Leila...

40:35.964 --> 40:38.666
- No, dad.
- Oh, baby.

40:38.734 --> 40:40.234
Dad, you're gonna--
you're gonna be fine.

40:40.301 --> 40:43.270
There's a vial
in my pocket.

40:43.322 --> 40:46.273
I forced Dr. Lu
to give me the vial.

40:46.341 --> 40:48.242
Get it to the President

40:48.309 --> 40:49.577
as soon as you can.

40:49.644 --> 40:52.913
- Dad, you're gonna be okay.
- Go, Leila.

40:57.369 --> 40:59.320
Just go.
Go! Go.

40:59.388 --> 41:01.889
Leila, we gotta go.

41:01.957 --> 41:04.425
- No, I'm not leaving him.
- Gotta go, Leila. Go.

41:04.493 --> 41:06.877
No. I'm not leaving.
He needs help.

41:06.962 --> 41:08.162
Leila...

41:08.213 --> 41:10.331
Go! Take the vial
to the President.

41:10.399 --> 41:13.768
Go.

41:18.223 --> 41:21.075
You're gonna be okay.

41:21.143 --> 41:24.311
Keep looking.

41:24.379 --> 41:27.415
I'm so sorry, baby.
