WEBVTT

00:17.809 --> 00:19.309
NARRATOR: Peace shattered.

00:19.436 --> 00:23.022
Once promising negotiations
between the Republic and the Separatists

00:23.106 --> 00:24.815
are now in shambles,

00:24.941 --> 00:28.777
following a droid suicide bombing
on the capital city-planet of Coruscant.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.947
As fear and anger prevail,

00:32.449 --> 00:36.201
the Senate overwhelmingly passes a bill
to deregulate the banks,

00:36.369 --> 00:40.873
opening the gateway to additional troops
and an increase in fighting.

00:43.501 --> 00:48.130
Members of the Senate, please. Please!

00:48.423 --> 00:49.882
How dare they!

00:49.966 --> 00:52.634
They attack, and now they want peace?

00:52.677 --> 00:54.261
Chancellor Palpatine,

00:55.305 --> 00:59.558
may I remind the senators that the peace
proposal was made prior to their assault.

00:59.851 --> 01:03.437
That only highlights its insincerity.

01:03.772 --> 01:08.942
Chancellor Palpatine, in light of
this unprovoked attack on Coruscant,

01:09.319 --> 01:11.695
and the vulnerabilities it raises,

01:11.780 --> 01:17.034
I propose the Republic purchase
an additional five million clone troopers.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.245
The Republic is already operating
in deep debt.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.165
How do you propose
we pay for these additional troops?

01:23.208 --> 01:28.670
My people are drafting an emergency
appropriations bill that would raise funds.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.255
From the Banking Clan?

01:30.590 --> 01:32.257
Yes, of course.

01:32.509 --> 01:35.094
Do you have an alternate means of paying?

01:35.428 --> 01:38.680
One alternative might be
to stop the war, not escalate it.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.015
Traitor!

01:40.100 --> 01:41.642
-Traitor!
-Traitor!

01:44.312 --> 01:48.398
Whoever attacked the power grid
wants us to continue the fight.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.860
It's a calculated attempt
to destroy the peace process.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.114
Not everyone
in the Confederacy wants this.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.740
I know this for a fact.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.159
You have Separatist friends, Senator?

01:59.202 --> 02:01.620
-Whose side are you on?
-SENATOR 1: Where's your loyalty?

02:01.704 --> 02:03.914
SENATOR 2: We will not stand for this!

02:05.500 --> 02:07.042
(ALL CLAMORING)

02:08.419 --> 02:12.339
Please. The young senator from Naboo
makes a point.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.967
There is no need to...

02:15.051 --> 02:16.635
(WHISPERS)

02:19.347 --> 02:24.351
We have just received a message
from our opponent, Count Dooku.

02:25.812 --> 02:31.650
Your Republic forces have carried
out a barbaric attack on our people,

02:32.402 --> 02:37.322
and among the deaths
was the very sponsor of the peace accord,

02:37.991 --> 02:40.409
Senator Mina Bonteri.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.869
What? No!

02:41.911 --> 02:44.204
With her needless death,

02:44.914 --> 02:49.710
I must formally withdraw the proposal
for peace offered by our Senate.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.046
We must not show weakness.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.548
(SNARLING)

03:03.099 --> 03:04.266
Thank you, Teckla.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.601
Yes, my lady.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.436
I can't believe it.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.939
I just can't believe the Republic
would target Senator Bonteri.

03:11.065 --> 03:14.234
She was the only one
willing to stand up for peace.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.903
You shouldn't believe it.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.280
The Republic's spies are reporting
that Senator Bonteri

03:18.406 --> 03:20.157
was murdered by Dooku's thugs.

03:20.658 --> 03:24.453
That message to the Senate was a ploy
to disguise his true actions.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.122
I am so sorry, Padmé.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.459
If your friend met with a violent end
because of her politics,

03:30.501 --> 03:33.253
let's make sure
her courageous effort wasn't in vain.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.546
What can we do?

03:34.797 --> 03:36.924
For one, defeat this bill.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.177
Can we really win this war
with the troops that we have?

03:40.303 --> 03:42.054
Let's hope we don't have to.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.473
I'll start lining up support,
but I'll need ammunition.

03:44.807 --> 03:47.351
We can't afford ammunition, remember?

03:50.772 --> 03:51.980
I joke.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.358
Go to the Banking Clan

03:54.484 --> 03:57.194
and see how much interest
they're going to charge for the loan.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.364
The more I know about what
the exact costs of this bill will be,

04:00.490 --> 04:02.783
the better I can make my case to defeat it.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.952
All right. Let's go, Uncle.

04:05.119 --> 04:07.162
You know these Banking Clan people.

04:07.372 --> 04:10.332
Plus, you owe me
for telling such a bad joke.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.209
(SIGHS)

04:12.293 --> 04:14.169
(GRUMBLING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE)

04:15.046 --> 04:19.007
We will lend the Republic
at our standard interest rate

04:19.092 --> 04:22.219
of 25%.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.637
What?

04:23.680 --> 04:25.180
25%?

04:25.390 --> 04:26.890
That's outright theft.

04:27.183 --> 04:30.143
Your previous arrangement with
the Republic was 10%.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.687
Please, please.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.356
That was before deregulation.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.859
The same rules don't apply, my dear.

04:38.236 --> 04:41.905
The Separatists don't seem to mind
a rate hike.

04:42.240 --> 04:46.243
In fact, they just secured a loan
to fund an additional

04:46.369 --> 04:49.288
three million battle droids.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.206
They will wipe us out.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.208
You would let Dooku do that?

04:53.710 --> 04:55.711
You live on Coruscant, too.

04:55.753 --> 04:59.589
We have no stake in this war, Senator.
You know that.

05:00.216 --> 05:04.928
War is distasteful to all of us.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.186
25% interest?

05:13.396 --> 05:14.604
That's a lot of credits.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.733
The interest alone
could completely bankrupt the Republic.

05:18.192 --> 05:21.361
As it is, social services have suffered
because of this war.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.489
Education, infrastructure, healthcare.

05:25.116 --> 05:29.411
If we go deeper into debt, the basic
needs of our people will evaporate.

05:29.495 --> 05:30.829
This is good.

05:30.913 --> 05:32.039
It is?

05:32.123 --> 05:34.750
Clearly, taking out a loan
on such obscene terms

05:34.959 --> 05:38.587
would essentially destroy the Republic,
regardless of the outcome of the war.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.423
We only need to sway
another handful of senators,

05:41.549 --> 05:43.675
as long as they don't buckle to the threats.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.843
What threats?

05:45.261 --> 05:49.681
Some members have received messages
warning them not to vote against the bill.

05:50.683 --> 05:53.101
Considering what's happened
to your friend Bonteri,

05:53.269 --> 05:54.478
they're frightened.

05:55.813 --> 05:58.273
AUTOMATED VOICE: A mandatory
blackout is in progress.

05:58.816 --> 06:01.485
All citizens report
to the designated safe area.

06:02.695 --> 06:05.113
A mandatory blackout is in progress.

06:05.573 --> 06:08.241
All citizens report
to the designated safe area.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.872
No! No!

06:19.045 --> 06:21.713
Can't you all see this bill is shortsighted?

06:22.006 --> 06:24.549
Millions of clones won't win this war.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.135
The only winner will be the Banking Clan.

06:27.387 --> 06:32.974
They want to pass this bill so badly,
they're using scare tactics to sway votes.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.644
I am not intimidated, Senator Amidala.

06:35.686 --> 06:38.146
Then why are you voting
for additional troops?

06:38.189 --> 06:42.275
I happen to believe more clones
are precisely what we need.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.404
And my caucus agrees with me.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.738
I'm sorry.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.081
Uncle Ono, what happened?

06:57.333 --> 07:00.043
Two thugs jumped me, but I am fine.

07:00.336 --> 07:01.837
This is outrageous.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.672
Something has to be done.

07:03.756 --> 07:07.175
Padmé, this will not change my mind.

07:07.718 --> 07:11.680
No matter what, I will vote against the bill.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.691
(PLAYING BLUESY MUSIC)

07:32.743 --> 07:36.705
I see Senator Amidala hasn't given up
her crusade.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.333
She doesn't have the votes, my Lord.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.544
(LAUGHS)

07:42.628 --> 07:46.506
We've taken care of 20 senators.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.552
It may be time to send her a message
as well.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.805
You want us to have a talk with her?

07:53.890 --> 07:54.890
No.

07:54.932 --> 07:59.436
I think something special
is called for in Senator Amidala's case.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.105
We're all ears, boss.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.900
Take her out of the game.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.280
(LAUGHING)

08:15.077 --> 08:17.662
As long as senators are being threatened
and attacked,

08:17.747 --> 08:20.081
I'm afraid we don't stand a chance.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.791
Intimidation won't work on everyone.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.793
Senator Farr is proof of that.

08:24.086 --> 08:27.297
Even so, we're still at least
six votes short of a majority.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.926
And you saw how effective
my plea was today.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.929
Some minds can't be altered
no matter what they hear.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.180
From my experience,

08:35.264 --> 08:38.391
it depends a great deal
on who's sending the message.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.935
And what are you thinking?

08:39.977 --> 08:43.438
Bail, you're the finest public speaker
I know.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.315
If anyone can convince the Senate

08:45.441 --> 08:47.442
that voting for this bill
will bankrupt the Republic,

08:47.527 --> 08:51.905
both financially and spiritually, it's you.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.282
It will be dangerous.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.452
I urge you to speak before the full Senate.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.705
I'll need some time to prepare.

09:00.957 --> 09:01.957
Good.

09:02.124 --> 09:05.544
In the meantime, I'll pay another visit
to those still undecided.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.306
I'll be parked just over there, my lady.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.642
Thank you. This way, Uncle.

09:23.187 --> 09:26.314
What does ideology matter at this point?

09:26.524 --> 09:29.025
Is it worth being beaten to death?

09:29.235 --> 09:31.653
Look at what they did to you.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.530
These wounds will heal.

09:34.156 --> 09:37.534
But what about the millions
who are dying in this war?

09:37.702 --> 09:39.828
Who, the clones?

09:39.870 --> 09:42.664
We created them for just that purpose.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.833
They are people.

09:44.917 --> 09:49.296
The people I care about
are my constituents,

09:49.338 --> 09:51.715
the ones who put me in office.

09:52.091 --> 09:55.677
And when was the last time
you ever spoke to your people?

09:56.012 --> 09:58.847
Probably the same time you did.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.765
Or you, Senator.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.937
Senator Christo, please.

10:06.355 --> 10:09.858
Is there anything we can do to get you
to change your mind?

10:11.068 --> 10:14.696
Where does Senator Organa stand
on all this?

10:14.947 --> 10:16.531
Why isn't he here?

10:16.574 --> 10:20.243
Senator Organa is preparing
to speak before the full Senate.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.203
Senator Organa?

10:22.246 --> 10:23.288
Hmm.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.874
I'll listen to what he has to say.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.460
So you are open to voting with us?

10:28.544 --> 10:32.797
I said I'll listen to what he has to say.

10:54.403 --> 10:56.988
Well, it's better than a no.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.824
I'm sure when Christo and the others hear
what Bail has to say,

10:59.909 --> 11:01.743
they will vote our way.

11:01.952 --> 11:03.745
Can I give you a ride?

11:03.788 --> 11:05.580
My driver's only a block away.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.457
I think I'd like to walk.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.000
But Padmé.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.794
Don't worry, Uncle Ono.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.213
I can take care of myself.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.382
Plus, I can use the fresh air.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.926

were trying to kill me!

I demand that you arrest them.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.470
Get your hands in the air.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.439
Ouch!

14:59.773 --> 15:02.650
Don't you think you should
report this to the Jedi Council?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.777
There's nothing they can do.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.613
I know who did it.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.990
They were bounty hunters

15:09.325 --> 15:12.285
paid to stop me from
voting against the troop increase.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.998
What has happened to democracy?

15:17.791 --> 15:20.168

Well, you do.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.548
Forgive me, my lady.

You're not like most politicians.

Well, you actually talk to the people.

And it's only getting worse.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.121
How?

15:57.539 --> 16:01.250
Please, tell me.
Tell me how it's getting worse.

16:25.609 --> 16:29.779
You're not gonna get away
like your lady friend, Senator.

16:29.905 --> 16:30.947
Senator!

16:35.828 --> 16:36.828
(EXCLAIMS)

17:08.944 --> 17:10.111
Medic!

17:11.780 --> 17:13.656
Oh! Padmé!

17:13.741 --> 17:14.782
What is it?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.159
You must come quickly.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.785
You need to see something.

17:21.623 --> 17:23.875
Bail! What happened?

17:24.793 --> 17:25.835
Padmé.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.628
Senator, you need to lie down.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.505
My speech, my speech.

17:29.798 --> 17:31.632
The Senate is expecting me.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.968
-Is there any way...
-I'm sorry.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.220
He's in no condition to even stand.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.555
We need to take him to the hospital.

17:37.723 --> 17:39.640
Of course. Take him at once.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.808
The speech.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.728
Padmé, you must address the Senate.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.397
Only you can do this.

17:50.986 --> 17:54.197
BURTONI: Perhaps we should
get the vote started.

17:54.406 --> 17:58.034
I told Senator Organa
I'd allow him to speak.

17:58.118 --> 18:00.161
We have waited long enough.

18:00.496 --> 18:03.664
I agree with Senator Orn Free Taa.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.249
Let's vote.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.627
You must give the speech in his place.

18:07.669 --> 18:10.505
But they're expecting to hear
from the great Bail Organa.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.507
He carries a certain weight.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.592
He's seen as a voice of reason.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.844
You are very respected.

18:17.387 --> 18:20.723
As a partisan.
I've been against this bill from day one.

18:21.016 --> 18:24.352
If they didn't listen to me before,
why would they listen now?

18:24.686 --> 18:26.854
Because you do listen.

18:27.189 --> 18:31.192
You understand
what the people are going through.

18:31.693 --> 18:32.735
Please.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.615
Your people are waiting for you.

18:40.953 --> 18:47.542
Let us now vote on Senator Burtoni's bill
to fund five million additional clones.

18:47.626 --> 18:51.045
The opposition to this bill
must be allowed to speak first.

18:51.547 --> 18:55.716
Unfortunately,
Senator Organa is nowhere to be found.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.136
I will speak on his behalf.

19:02.975 --> 19:06.144
Senator Amidala will be permitted
to speak.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.899
Teckla Minnau...

19:15.112 --> 19:17.155
Teckla is one of my aides.

19:18.157 --> 19:22.076
Like so many of the people
that we tell ourselves we're here to serve,

19:22.911 --> 19:24.412
Teckla lives in a district

19:24.454 --> 19:29.792
that rarely has electricity and running
water as a result of the war.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.921
Her children can now only bathe
every two weeks,

19:33.964 --> 19:38.467
and they have no light
in which to read or study at night.

19:39.303 --> 19:42.972
The Republic has always funded
these basic services,

19:43.348 --> 19:48.019
but now, there are those who would divert
the money to the war,

19:48.103 --> 19:51.814
with no thought for what
the people need to survive.

19:52.357 --> 19:55.651
lf not for people like
Teckla and her children,

19:55.944 --> 19:57.945
who are we fighting for?

19:58.363 --> 20:02.867
My people, your people, all of our people.

20:03.452 --> 20:08.706
This war is meant to save them from
suffering, not increase it.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.459
I support our brave soldiers,

20:11.668 --> 20:14.045
whether they come from
the clone factories,

20:14.213 --> 20:17.882
or from any of the thousands of systems
loyal to the Republic.

20:18.675 --> 20:21.469
But if we continue
to impoverish our people,

20:21.803 --> 20:25.139
it is not on the battlefield
where Dooku will defeat us,

20:25.682 --> 20:27.850
but in our own homes.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.728
Therefore, it is our duty

20:31.480 --> 20:33.022
and our responsibility

20:33.899 --> 20:37.026
to preserve the lives of those around us

20:37.361 --> 20:39.820
by defeating this bill!

20:44.159 --> 20:46.160
Well done, Padmé!

21:18.193 --> 21:23.197
Isn't it remarkable that one can have
all the power in the galaxy,

21:24.032 --> 21:27.034
and yet the words of a single senator

21:27.119 --> 21:29.870
can sway the thoughts of millions?

21:30.372 --> 21:32.790
What do you plan to do about this?

21:33.875 --> 21:37.420
For now, we must adhere to the
principles of our democracy.

21:40.465 --> 21:44.427
We must let the wheels of the Senate turn.

22:27.596 --> 22:28.596
