[Dayanara groaning]

01:27.188 --> 01:29.148
Feels like somebody's
strangling my guts.

01:29.232 --> 01:30.900
I know.

01:30.984 --> 01:32.736
It's like they squeeze them
till they die.

01:32.819 --> 01:36.239
I know, mami, I know.
But you have to relax.

01:36.322 --> 01:38.282
Try to roll through it, okay?

01:38.366 --> 01:40.534
You fight it, it's worse.

01:40.618 --> 01:42.912
Aquí, put this behind her back.

01:42.996 --> 01:44.831
- Bebé.
- [Dayanara] Thanks.

_

01:52.421 --> 01:54.340
[speaking English]
Yeah. That, too.

01:54.423 --> 01:57.927
I can't wait for this baby to come,
so she can stop being pregnant.

01:58.011 --> 02:01.597
"Oh! My back!
Oh, I'm shitting in pellets now."

02:01.680 --> 02:04.600
Have some compassion.
You had a baby, too.

02:04.683 --> 02:06.770
Yeah, but it wasn't a big deal.

02:06.853 --> 02:08.604
I didn't know she was in there till,
like, seven months.

02:08.687 --> 02:11.900
How could you not know?
You weigh 90 pounds.

02:11.983 --> 02:14.610
You must have looked like
a egg with four sticks in it.

02:14.693 --> 02:16.362
I'm not a scientist, okay?

02:16.445 --> 02:18.156
I was smoking a lot of pot that summer.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.077
I got pineapple!

02:23.161 --> 02:24.788
You eat this,
things will go fast.

02:24.871 --> 02:27.540
La china found it on the bottom shelf
in commissary.

02:27.623 --> 02:30.001
It's from 2006,
but cans last forever, right?

02:30.084 --> 02:32.211
I don't want her in here.
She tried to sell the baby.

02:32.295 --> 02:34.588
It's not about the baby.
It's about you.

02:34.672 --> 02:37.801
She's a whole thing,
but she loves you... in her way.

02:37.884 --> 02:40.762
Her way's not good enough!

02:40.845 --> 02:42.471
Seriously, get out!

02:42.555 --> 02:44.766
Go, get the fuck out!

02:44.849 --> 02:46.017
[groaning]

02:46.100 --> 02:50.396
[Gloria] Okay, all right.
You're doing good, mami, that's good.

It's a balloon that looks like a condom.

03:57.839 --> 04:00.424
[Lorna] I don't wanna be
crass about it, but...

04:00.508 --> 04:02.593
everyone knows
I'm your best daughter.

04:02.676 --> 04:08.057
But I... will massage your feet
every day for a week with my hands.

04:08.141 --> 04:10.101
This is an open lottery, ladies.

04:10.184 --> 04:13.396
I don't play favorites,
I don't take bribes.

04:13.479 --> 04:16.940
Put your names on the list,
and good luck to you.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.652
They're the ones
who gave her the ticket out.

04:19.735 --> 04:21.445
What did they think
she was gonna do?

04:21.529 --> 04:24.782
I just can't believe she sat
in that bus station like a flat balloon.

04:24.866 --> 04:26.367
I guess she lost faith.

04:27.743 --> 04:29.453
Either that or there's some kind of flaw

04:29.537 --> 04:32.706
in our randomly improvised
Norma-based theological system.

04:32.790 --> 04:35.877
That attitude is not gonna help us
get seats at this dinner.

04:38.379 --> 04:41.007
I heard the zucchini night was incredible.

04:41.090 --> 04:42.633
Girl, I was there.

04:42.716 --> 04:47.346
She did this fried thing with the flowers
that made tears come out of my eyes.

04:47.430 --> 04:48.890
Wait, if you went to the last one,

04:48.973 --> 04:51.350
you should let someone else
have a chance.

04:51.434 --> 04:52.601
Past is the past.

04:52.685 --> 04:53.937
Today is a new day,

04:54.020 --> 04:57.815
and we're all equal
in Red's magic restaurant.

04:57.899 --> 05:00.109
Not to brag,
but if you make it in,

05:00.193 --> 05:04.030
you will feel things about corn
you have never felt before.

05:04.113 --> 05:05.907
- [Anita chuckles]
- Good luck, ladies.

05:05.990 --> 05:09.953
For the record, I'm an excellent
conversationalist on at least...

05:11.579 --> 05:12.997
four topics.

05:13.081 --> 05:14.748
Oh...

05:21.130 --> 05:22.966
You look kind of busted.

05:23.049 --> 05:25.384
Busted or broken-up-with?

05:26.552 --> 05:28.137
Wow, sorry.

05:29.638 --> 05:32.308
But not that sorry.
It's kind of a relief, isn't it?

05:32.391 --> 05:34.477
Maybe, I don't know.

05:34.560 --> 05:38.439
I mean... she was acting so weird,
but it's still, I can't even... It's...

05:38.522 --> 05:39.815
She broke up with me?

05:39.898 --> 05:42.110
[chuckles] That's your ego talking.

05:42.193 --> 05:43.319
I mean,
what am I supposed to do now?

05:43.402 --> 05:44.653
It's like,
we still live in the same place.

05:44.737 --> 05:45.904
It's not like I can just go take off,

05:45.989 --> 05:48.657
and visit my slacker cousins
in California for a few weeks

05:48.741 --> 05:50.284
while I lick my wounds
and stalk her on Facebook.

05:50.368 --> 05:53.746
Stop being such a girl, Chapman.

05:55.873 --> 05:57.791
Come with me to movie night.

05:59.085 --> 06:01.712
You know, Alex and I may be
on a break right now,

06:01.795 --> 06:04.007
and it's not like I...

06:05.341 --> 06:07.010
It's not like I don't feel things.

06:07.093 --> 06:08.177
I just don't...

06:08.261 --> 06:11.055
I don't think I'm ready to
just jump into a whole new thing.

06:11.139 --> 06:13.182
I think I'm gonna need
a little bit of time.

06:13.266 --> 06:17.561
So, the assumption there is that
I'm some starving lesbian jackal

06:17.645 --> 06:21.857
just waiting to pounce on the...
warm bones of your relationship.

06:21.940 --> 06:23.609
- Well, fuck you.
- No.

06:23.692 --> 06:26.654
That's not...
I was just trying to...

06:26.737 --> 06:29.990
Was just... I guess I was just
trying to be considerate or whatever.

06:30.074 --> 06:33.452
Well, for your information,
the jackal does just fine.

06:35.746 --> 06:36.955
Do you know where Berdie is?

06:37.040 --> 06:40.126
I went to her office this morning
and she wasn't there.

06:40.209 --> 06:43.879
She's suspended while
they investigate an incident.

06:43.962 --> 06:45.548
For how long?

06:45.631 --> 06:47.425
I... I have no idea.

06:48.759 --> 06:52.721
I think maybe you...
were right.

06:52.805 --> 06:54.515
Which time?

06:54.598 --> 06:55.933
When you...

06:57.060 --> 06:59.270
said I should try medication.

07:00.729 --> 07:02.273
I never really thought I'd do it,

07:02.356 --> 07:06.569
but I don't wanna
feel like this anymore.

07:07.778 --> 07:09.280
I'll give you another referral,

07:09.363 --> 07:12.200
with a recommendation for antidepressants.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.620
I really do think they'll help a lot.

07:19.248 --> 07:21.584
Do you know what they'll give me?

07:21.667 --> 07:27.506
MCC just subcontracted Medical
out to another corporation.

07:29.425 --> 07:31.760
New doctors, new rules...

07:34.263 --> 07:37.683
but... first steps.

07:43.481 --> 07:45.233
I could tell Caputo, I guess.

07:46.109 --> 07:48.194
He did march old Pornstache
right out of here

07:48.277 --> 07:52.406
when he found out what happened with him
and that Spanish girl, remember?

07:52.490 --> 07:53.866
The one that looks like a goldfish.

07:53.949 --> 07:56.660
Yeah, but Spanish girl
had a belly full of fetus.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.496
That's why the marching happened.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.124
I mean, short of that...
[scoffs] you're farting in the wind.

08:01.207 --> 08:02.541
I know, but I'm telling the truth.

08:02.625 --> 08:05.128
Yep, and Donuts, he's gonna lie.

08:05.211 --> 08:06.754
Who do you think they'll believe?

08:06.837 --> 08:08.756
I have a feeling
you're gonna say it ain't me.

08:08.839 --> 08:10.758
We are liars and degenerates,

08:10.841 --> 08:13.844
and we deserve everything
that happens to us.

08:13.927 --> 08:17.181
So, I get fucked
and now I'm screwed.

08:17.265 --> 08:19.850
Yep, that's about the short of it.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.977
But that don't make it over.

08:22.978 --> 08:24.355
You hear me?

08:24.438 --> 08:26.315
Hey!

08:26.399 --> 08:29.610
You got a big, angry bull dyke
on your side now.

08:29.693 --> 08:32.988
And I am a firm believer
in good ol'-fashioned revenge.

08:34.407 --> 08:37.034
You ain't thinking about killing him,
are you?

08:37.118 --> 08:39.828
Nah, that shit's too messy.

08:39.912 --> 08:42.706
Nope, I got a better idea.

08:42.789 --> 08:47.253
We are gonna go full-on
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo on this guy.

08:47.336 --> 08:50.464
[scoffs] What's us getting tattoos
gonna teach him?

08:51.382 --> 08:53.134
[laughing]

08:53.217 --> 08:54.927
No.

08:55.010 --> 08:56.387
See...

08:56.470 --> 08:59.307
Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,
it's Swedish.

08:59.390 --> 09:00.974
It means,
"We're gonna rape him back."

09:04.145 --> 09:06.980
Whoa, got it all lubed up
for you there, Rodcocker.

09:07.064 --> 09:08.899
Aw, Jesus Christ already.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.734
[Big Boo stifling laughter]

09:14.071 --> 09:16.114
- I'm closed.
- [Reema] That's cool.

09:16.199 --> 09:18.701
We just wanted to ask you a question.

09:20.328 --> 09:23.247
Spanish been saying
how you still got your dick.

09:24.122 --> 09:26.500
- That true?
- [Sophia sighs]

09:26.584 --> 09:28.126
What you got between your legs
is your business,

09:28.211 --> 09:30.045
- and what I got is mine.
- Maybe.

09:30.128 --> 09:34.508
But my man is out at Lexington
and he's having a real hard time.

09:34.592 --> 09:36.427
Hard.

09:36.510 --> 09:40.097
Meanwhile, you hiding out in here,
"pretending" to be a female.

09:40.181 --> 09:42.516
[Gabby] Seems like you got it
all figured out.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.353
You have any idea
how ignorant you sound?

09:46.312 --> 09:49.898
We just want a little peek.
Educate ourselves.

09:51.275 --> 09:52.276
[scoffs]

09:55.696 --> 09:57.323
Get the fuck out of my house.

09:58.907 --> 10:00.033
Not till we see it.

10:00.117 --> 10:01.619
[Gabby] Get her! Get her!
[Sophia grunting]

10:01.702 --> 10:03.412
[Reema] Fuck you, she-male!
[Sophia] Fuck!

10:03.496 --> 10:04.830
[Gabby laughing]

10:05.873 --> 10:07.708
[both grunting]

10:08.209 --> 10:09.585
[Reema] Ow!

10:11.295 --> 10:13.964
Damn, I told you
he still had his man strength!

10:15.841 --> 10:18.093
Don't think I won't kill you,
you fucking cunt!

10:18.176 --> 10:19.970
[Gabby] That's it, bitch!
[Sophia grunting]

10:20.053 --> 10:21.972
[Sophia] Fuck you, bitches.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.891
- Help me!
- I'll get Caputo.

10:26.018 --> 10:28.687
I try to do the right thing,
and my own daughter hates me.

10:28.771 --> 10:30.731
But at least your daughter
knows who you are.

10:30.814 --> 10:33.025
Pepa ain't even
gonna remember me.

10:33.942 --> 10:35.819
It ain't like you deserve it,
naming your daughter Pepa.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.947
Hey! Yo, Push It
is me and Yadriel's song, a'ight?

10:39.031 --> 10:40.616
Whatever, I'm sorry.

10:41.199 --> 10:43.118
But I'm telling you, kids...
[scoffs]

10:43.201 --> 10:46.372
All they do is break your balls,
morning to night.

10:46.455 --> 10:48.457
And yet you had, like, 11 of them.

10:48.541 --> 10:50.042
What else was I doing, right?

10:51.043 --> 10:54.297
Plus, when they little,
they love you so much.

10:54.380 --> 10:56.674
It's like having fans.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.592
Who puke on you, but still.

10:58.676 --> 11:00.093
[sighs]

11:00.177 --> 11:02.054
Yeah, they think you're perfect.

11:02.137 --> 11:04.557
No one else is ever gonna
feel that way about us, that's for sure.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.850
That's the thing, isn't it?

11:06.934 --> 11:09.562
You know,
I kept leaving these messages,

11:09.645 --> 11:13.441
calling him an asshole, saying,
"Oh, my baby girl needs her mama."

11:13.524 --> 11:17.695
But... the truth is...
that she's fine.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.697
Yadriel loves her.

11:19.780 --> 11:23.576
His mother is a good person...
and she's gonna be okay.

11:24.618 --> 11:27.245
I'm not freaking out
because she needs me.

11:27.330 --> 11:29.957
I'm freaking out
because I need her.

11:32.501 --> 11:34.920
[indistinct chattering]

11:42.052 --> 11:43.762
Hi, can I get your name, please?

11:43.846 --> 11:45.013
Diaz.

11:46.014 --> 11:49.727
- I've got seven Diazes.
- Dayanara.

11:49.810 --> 11:53.397
Okay, cool!
That's a pretty name.

11:53.481 --> 11:56.108
- I wanna go home.
- [Stacy] I know.

11:56.191 --> 11:58.736
It's weird being in a new place
with all new people, right?

11:58.819 --> 12:01.864
But I promise by tomorrow,
you're gonna be settling right in.

12:01.947 --> 12:03.532
You got a phone here,
if she needs me?

12:03.616 --> 12:06.869
We have a policy of
no phone calls home for the first week.

12:06.952 --> 12:08.829
It helps the campers get acclimated.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.874
You're in Cabin Six!

12:11.957 --> 12:14.377
Why don't I take you over
to meet your new bunk mates?

12:14.460 --> 12:15.628
I can take her things.

12:16.587 --> 12:17.880
So, this is it?

12:17.963 --> 12:20.298
She's gonna have a great time.

12:20.383 --> 12:21.800
I hate it here!

12:21.884 --> 12:25.262
There are bugs on the ground!
You can't make me stay!

12:25.345 --> 12:27.139
[Aleida] Remember how
we talked about this?

12:27.222 --> 12:29.349
I wanna go home, Mommy, please!

12:29.433 --> 12:31.477
Óyeme, you little brat.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.396
You think I got nothing better to do
than take care of you?

12:33.479 --> 12:36.106
This is my one-month vacation!

12:36.189 --> 12:39.234
And I got things planned starting tonight.
Mommy's going out.

12:41.236 --> 12:42.821
[whimpering] Mommy, no...

12:42.905 --> 12:46.199
Can you... can you just go with her?
Just...

12:48.577 --> 12:50.704
- Mommy!
- Daya, please!

12:52.330 --> 12:54.374
I think you should go now.

12:55.333 --> 12:59.046
Mommy! Mommy, come back!
Mommy!

13:00.964 --> 13:02.591
Mommy!

13:04.802 --> 13:06.512
Mommy!

13:36.208 --> 13:37.460
Hey.

13:37.543 --> 13:39.086
Hi.

13:39.169 --> 13:41.464
- You doing okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

13:41.547 --> 13:44.467
Don't be obtuse.
I'm not trying to be a dick.

13:44.550 --> 13:46.802
- I'm fine.
- Seriously? That's how you're doing...

13:46.885 --> 13:50.430
Hey, hey, you guys got a second?
It's about, um... you know...

13:50.514 --> 13:52.850
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, that's more her deal now.

13:52.933 --> 13:56.479
Oh, cool.
Look, I... I got a problem.

13:57.145 --> 13:59.690
Did you get the stuff to Cal?

13:59.773 --> 14:01.900
See you later, Chapman.

14:04.194 --> 14:07.197
Everything went fine, okay?
I just...

14:07.280 --> 14:09.116
I can't do this anymore, all right?

14:09.199 --> 14:10.659
It's not worth it.
I'm sorry.

14:32.890 --> 14:35.893
"Generalized depression and anxiety,

14:35.976 --> 14:39.688
low self-esteem
and feelings of isolation."

14:39.772 --> 14:41.815
Mr. Healy says pills might work.

14:41.899 --> 14:44.610
I think you're a candidate for Doxepin.

14:44.693 --> 14:47.279
It might make you a little sleepy, but...

14:47.362 --> 14:49.782
if you're asleep,
you won't eat compulsively

14:49.865 --> 14:52.075
and get fat,
which is another side effect.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.702
We wouldn't want that.

14:55.871 --> 14:59.708
I'm gonna peek in your chart.
You had a physical, right?

14:59.792 --> 15:02.210
When I first got here,
six months ago.

15:02.294 --> 15:05.589
Yeah...
I'm still moving in.

15:05.673 --> 15:09.677
I've got D to G
and P through R.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.930
You're probably in the other room.
Give me a sec.

15:28.445 --> 15:32.700
I don't need this right now, inmate.
I'm developing a fucking ulcer.

15:32.783 --> 15:35.118
None of this is my fault.

15:35.202 --> 15:37.162
They jumped me.
I was attacked.

15:37.245 --> 15:38.789
I know.

15:38.872 --> 15:42.125
- You do?
- Yes.

15:42.209 --> 15:44.545
I hear things.

15:44.628 --> 15:47.339
How things have been going ugly for you
for a while now.

15:48.006 --> 15:49.466
It's herd mentality.

15:49.550 --> 15:51.844
The tide turns,
everybody wigs out.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.681
People don't like
what they can't understand.

15:55.764 --> 15:58.433
So, what are you gonna do about it?

15:58.516 --> 16:00.518
I'm gonna have the guards
keep a closer eye on you.

16:00.603 --> 16:02.145
They'll be ready if anything starts up.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.815
So, basically,
you're putting me under surveillance?

16:04.898 --> 16:06.483
Well, there's not much else I can do.

16:06.567 --> 16:10.946
There's a lot you could do,
starting with firing CO Sikowitz.

16:11.029 --> 16:14.199
Sikowitz is not the problem here.

16:14.282 --> 16:16.994
The problem is she's a chipmunk in boots

16:17.077 --> 16:19.997
who never got proper training
due to negligence.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.707
[sobbing] I want her fired,

16:21.790 --> 16:25.377
and I want crisis and
sensitivity training for all the guards.

16:26.795 --> 16:27.880
Look...

16:29.297 --> 16:30.465
Burset...

16:31.383 --> 16:33.551
I sympathize, I really do.

16:33.636 --> 16:36.221
But we have to be realistic
about our recourse here.

16:37.097 --> 16:40.893
Ask my lawyer how realistic I am.

16:40.976 --> 16:44.479
Your lawyer?
These guys have teams of lawyers.

16:44.562 --> 16:47.775
Driving in Mercedes, expensing lunches...

16:47.858 --> 16:51.820
and crushing cases like yours
under their Italian leather shoes.

16:52.988 --> 16:55.323
I have no doubt.

16:56.324 --> 16:58.035
But here's what I got.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.870
A Post headline...

16:59.953 --> 17:01.997
"She-Male Jail Fail.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.833
Balls to the Wall
in Tranny Prison Brawl."

17:04.916 --> 17:07.544
That shit sells like hotcakes.

17:07.627 --> 17:11.589
And everyone will be reading about it,
and everyone will be talking about it,

17:11.674 --> 17:14.050
including the ladies of The View.

17:14.134 --> 17:17.762
You think MCC wants
that kind of attention?

17:17.846 --> 17:20.098
Jesus, Burset.

17:20.182 --> 17:22.349
Why you do you have to
make everything so hard?

17:23.852 --> 17:27.314
No offense, but fuck you...

17:27.396 --> 17:28.857
sir.

17:32.861 --> 17:34.404
[sniffing] Oh, Jesus.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.281
I think we need a plan B.

17:36.364 --> 17:37.700
Are you pussying out on me right now?

17:37.783 --> 17:42.620
Look, if being a pussy is
not wanting to eat rats in SHU, then...

17:42.705 --> 17:44.372
[loudly] No one's going to SHU...

17:45.123 --> 17:46.249
Louder.

17:49.461 --> 17:52.047
Remember how I was
in the Puppy Program?

17:53.006 --> 17:56.593
Well, see, I may have palmed
a doggie sedative,

17:56.677 --> 17:58.053
or four,

17:58.136 --> 18:01.056
that I have been keeping
as a treat for myself

18:01.139 --> 18:03.266
in case I would like to fake a seizure,

18:03.350 --> 18:07.479
go on a vacation to a hospital
and touch nurses.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.941
Do you see, this is how much
I care about you, Doggett.

18:11.024 --> 18:15.487
I am willing to
burn that dream on you.

18:16.822 --> 18:19.867
Wait, are you saying that you want
to put the puppy night-night pill,

18:19.950 --> 18:20.951
like, in his coffee?

18:21.034 --> 18:23.120
[chuckling] Yeah,
he won't even see us coming.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.788
[chuckles] Then what?

18:24.872 --> 18:28.751
Then he wakes up
with a flashlight shoved up his ass.

18:28.834 --> 18:33.046
Boo, how do you expect to fit
a flashlight up someone's ass

18:33.130 --> 18:34.672
that hasn't had a warm up?

18:34.757 --> 18:37.467
Okay, uh, something slippery?
Bar of soap?

18:37.550 --> 18:39.677
Yeah, but bars of soap?
They're even wider.

18:39.762 --> 18:42.139
- Think about it, they're like...
- Assuming his shit is tight.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.475
I mean, you'd be surprised
what people get up to in their free time.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.560
What?

18:49.687 --> 18:51.481
How about...

18:51.564 --> 18:54.359
How about a broom?
A broomstick?

18:54.442 --> 18:56.194
- Great.
- No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:57.112 --> 19:00.407
Nope, splinters.
He'll get splinters in his ass.

19:00.490 --> 19:01.784
Doggett...

19:01.867 --> 19:05.746
his comfort is not our fucking concern.

19:06.747 --> 19:08.456
- That's right.
- It's right.

19:08.540 --> 19:10.834
- Yeah.
- You got me there.

19:10.918 --> 19:13.128
I'm just a girl
trying to start a business,

19:13.211 --> 19:15.756
get a tiny piece of
the American dream for myself.

19:15.839 --> 19:17.215
Why does the universe hate me?

19:17.299 --> 19:19.843
He's not quitting.

19:19.927 --> 19:23.305
He's wised up.
He's playing you like a fiddle.

19:25.265 --> 19:28.310
Shit... you're right.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.939
- He said it wasn't worth it.
- [Stella] Mmm.

19:32.022 --> 19:33.606
He probably wants
more money like everyone else.

19:33.690 --> 19:35.608
But he didn't...

19:37.444 --> 19:40.155
Oh, my God.

19:41.448 --> 19:44.034
- This is about the handjob.
- Oh, you gave him a handjob?

19:44.117 --> 19:46.203
No, I may have promised...

19:47.245 --> 19:50.833
I may have intimated that
there was a slight... possibility.

19:50.916 --> 19:54.086
I mean, if he proved his value
to the organization.

19:55.253 --> 19:56.880
Another mystery solved.

19:56.964 --> 19:57.965
No.

19:58.048 --> 20:00.633
If this is what he's angling for,
why didn't he just come out with it?

20:00.717 --> 20:02.219
No pun intended.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.012
He's a kid.
He's barely through puberty.

20:04.096 --> 20:05.680
He's probably never even kissed a girl.

20:05.763 --> 20:08.934
Oh, that is so sweet.
Well, it shouldn't take long.

20:09.017 --> 20:11.644
Forty-five seconds and
he'll be sneezing right in your hand.

20:11.728 --> 20:12.729
Oh!

20:13.730 --> 20:15.398
What does Vause think of it?

20:15.482 --> 20:18.026
Vause does not need
to know about this, capisce?

20:18.110 --> 20:20.863
Suit yourself.
I don't get involved.

20:20.946 --> 20:22.155
Mmm.

20:23.156 --> 20:24.741
I feel like a molester.

20:25.575 --> 20:27.577
Which is weird...

20:27.660 --> 20:30.288
because I am clearly
also being exploited here.

20:30.372 --> 20:31.999
Hmm...

20:32.082 --> 20:34.835
sounds like you've got a dilemma.

20:34.918 --> 20:36.753
[indistinct chatter]

20:56.148 --> 20:58.025
Whoo! Man...

20:58.108 --> 21:01.736
this farm-to-table thing is
for real, am I right?

21:01.819 --> 21:05.490
Man, we're gonna be flossin'
for, like, a straight hour after this.

21:05.573 --> 21:08.701
Yo, what happened to your new weave?
You were lookin' fresh.

21:08.785 --> 21:10.370
Nah, I wasn't feelin' it.

21:10.453 --> 21:12.539
Yeah, what she feeling is scared

21:12.622 --> 21:15.042
that Sophia gonna
hulk out on her and shit.

21:15.125 --> 21:17.502
- [both grumbling]
- [Taystee] Untrue.

21:17.585 --> 21:18.921
Yo, I don't blame you.

21:19.004 --> 21:21.131
Shit's getting ugly
in the RuPaul Drag Race.

21:21.214 --> 21:23.425
Yo, Sophia ain't a drag queen, yo.

21:23.508 --> 21:25.010
She ain't walking around
in a costume.

21:25.093 --> 21:26.970
I feel bad about it.

21:27.054 --> 21:29.932
- This is why I do my own hair.
- Wait, that's hair?

21:30.015 --> 21:32.267
This whole time I thought you was wearin'
Mickey Mouse ears!

21:32.350 --> 21:34.394
- [all laughing]
- You...

21:40.400 --> 21:43.611
[gasps] Oh, tell me
what's happening here.

21:43.695 --> 21:46.739
Mmm, at the moment,
we enjoying some corn.

21:46.823 --> 21:48.992
- [Janae] Mmm-hmm.
- Corn that doesn't belong to you.

21:49.076 --> 21:51.954
Uh-huh, 'cause it came from
the garden, you see what I'm sayin',

21:52.037 --> 21:54.664
which is on community prison property
that we all share.

21:54.747 --> 21:57.375
So, really, it do belong to us.

21:57.459 --> 21:59.502
You lazy shakhtor thief!

21:59.586 --> 22:01.838
[Janae] Shit...
[Red] You did nothing for this.

22:01.922 --> 22:04.674
Other people planted it, watered it,
raked the weeds.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.343
Yeah, well,
guess who else got experience

22:06.426 --> 22:09.429
growin' shit for other people to eat
and gettin' none of it?

22:09.512 --> 22:11.098
- I know!
- [Black Cindy] Watson?

22:11.181 --> 22:12.807
Is it our ancestors?

22:12.890 --> 22:15.018
- Ohhh, correct!
- [Janae] Whoo-hoo!

22:15.102 --> 22:19.522
And now, we takin' back
a little thing called... reparations.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.067
You sure you want to
get into the ring with me?

22:22.150 --> 22:23.610
- Oh, okay!
- [Janae] What if she do?

22:23.693 --> 22:25.737
[Taystee] All right, everybody jump back,
jump back.

22:25.820 --> 22:27.364
You think I won't pound
that spiky redhead?

22:27.447 --> 22:28.740
Yo, I said, jump back!

22:28.823 --> 22:30.325
What the fuck?

22:30.408 --> 22:32.577
Now, this is not how
you handle your shit with Red.

22:32.660 --> 22:34.079
- Man, fuck her!
- Okay?

22:34.162 --> 22:35.788
And you got to stop using slavery

22:35.872 --> 22:37.499
every time you wanna
justify some foolishness!

22:37.582 --> 22:40.418
I'm just using it as a placeholder
till I become Jewish

22:40.502 --> 22:41.711
and I can pin it on Hitler.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.255
Crazy, man.

22:43.338 --> 22:44.547
Listen up, all right?

22:44.631 --> 22:47.050
We are not getting into it
with the white girls.

22:47.134 --> 22:48.510
We had enough of that with Vee!

22:48.593 --> 22:50.512
[Black Cindy sighs]
[Taystee sighs]

22:53.806 --> 22:55.350
I apologize.

22:55.433 --> 22:58.478
You know what I can't do
with an apology, Jefferson?

22:58.561 --> 23:01.689
I can't roast it with
creamer and chili powder

23:01.773 --> 23:04.609
and serve it to the people who are
coming to my dinner tomorrow night.

23:04.692 --> 23:05.985
What else you got?

23:06.069 --> 23:08.613
Parsley...
and I got some onions,

23:08.696 --> 23:11.658
and I got a pantry full of Saltines.

23:11.741 --> 23:13.743
Okay, okay, um...

23:15.953 --> 23:20.750
But nobody will care...
when you introduce your new sommelier.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.210
Ah!
[speaking mock French]

23:22.294 --> 23:24.962
This is ridiculous.

23:25.047 --> 23:26.048
Man, it could be classy.

23:26.131 --> 23:27.715
Look, I know a hooch specialist

23:27.799 --> 23:30.760
who's got a little extra
that she needs to unload.

23:30.843 --> 23:33.513
Wait, you clownin' on me, right?
This her fault!

23:33.596 --> 23:36.808
I know, but she has fewer
marketable skills, all right?

23:37.809 --> 23:39.436
I'm so sorry, Red.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.229
We just been eatin' crap for so long

23:41.313 --> 23:44.566
that when we ran into the corn, we just...

23:44.649 --> 23:45.942
lost our minds a little bit.

23:50.655 --> 23:54.117
She can wash dishes for me.
You and Watson, too.

23:54.201 --> 23:56.369
I want the kitchen spotless tonight,

23:56.453 --> 23:58.913
- and I want you to do the clean-up after.
- Fine.

23:58.996 --> 24:00.665
- Aw, man, that's some bullshit...
- Shut up, Cindy.

24:00.748 --> 24:03.626
- And I'll take that hooch.
- [Taystee] Good.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.920
And no one touches my garden again.

24:07.672 --> 24:09.091
Obviously.

24:12.260 --> 24:15.388
[Cal] Forty-two pairs of
beautiful, sweaty panties,

24:15.472 --> 24:17.765
painstakingly crafted over days at a time,

24:17.849 --> 24:20.435
and they don't even
make a dent in the orders.

24:20.518 --> 24:21.811
- [Neri sighs]
- [machine whirring]

24:21.894 --> 24:25.315
I feel like we're standing
in front of a Vegas buffet of money

24:25.398 --> 24:28.443
and we're only allowed to take, like,
a plate of fries at a time.

24:28.526 --> 24:30.903
Maybe we can jack up the prices again?

24:30.987 --> 24:34.574
I mean, this is premium
artisanal shit, right?

24:34.657 --> 24:38.786
The Spanish charge $400 for a ham
and nobody blinks an eye.

24:38.870 --> 24:43.791
Well, that's because they feed those pigs
only acorns or olives or whatever.

24:43.875 --> 24:46.002
Wait, this is genius.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.671
What if the panties were flavored?

24:48.755 --> 24:51.591
Like, this girl only ate strawberries
for a week.

24:51.674 --> 24:55.595
Hmm, I think that might go against
the whole authentic prison vibe.

24:55.678 --> 24:58.431
They're dirty, dirty felons,
not Kobe beef.

24:58.515 --> 24:59.849
I know. Damn it.

25:01.058 --> 25:02.852
[Neri] Maybe we go the other way.

25:02.935 --> 25:05.855
Like, who makes more money,
Bloomingdales or Walmart?

25:05.938 --> 25:08.691
We crank 'em out fast and cheap,
flood the market.

25:08.775 --> 25:11.486
And where do we get
these cheap and fast girls,

25:11.569 --> 25:14.572
other than every single
friend of yours? No.

25:14.656 --> 25:16.741
We are not getting into bed
with your friends,

25:16.824 --> 25:18.493
because they are horrible people,

25:18.576 --> 25:22.622
and they can't keep their traps shut
for five goddamn minutes at a time.

25:22.705 --> 25:25.082
And they're not in prison...

25:25.167 --> 25:26.334
yet.

25:26.418 --> 25:27.460
- But... [whines]
- No.

25:27.544 --> 25:29.921
This is Piper's very illegal business.

25:30.004 --> 25:32.632
We can't go bringing
people into it willy-nilly.

25:32.715 --> 25:34.467
Well, what Piper doesn't know
won't hurt her.

25:34.551 --> 25:36.010
Oh, my God, listen to yourself.

25:36.093 --> 25:38.596
Thug life is already making you cold.

25:40.765 --> 25:42.350
[machine whirring]

25:45.353 --> 25:47.314
[grunting]

25:47.397 --> 25:48.690
[breathing heavily]

25:48.773 --> 25:50.608
[Maritza] That was a rough one.

25:50.692 --> 25:54.987
Hey, you want me to do your hair
or something?

25:55.071 --> 25:57.240
It's just all flat and sweaty.

25:57.324 --> 25:59.909
I'll make you look real pretty
for the baby.

25:59.992 --> 26:02.119
- You're not helping, Ramos!
- Sorry.

26:02.204 --> 26:04.121
Oh, fuck!

26:06.999 --> 26:08.418
How you doing?

26:11.128 --> 26:13.923
- Can I talk at least?
- Fine.

26:21.556 --> 26:22.599
[whimpering]

26:22.682 --> 26:26.728
I know you feel like I only look out
for myself, and maybe I do.

26:26.811 --> 26:28.521
That's how I know to do life.

26:29.481 --> 26:32.191
But I want you to know,
this baby...

26:33.318 --> 26:34.736
it wasn't about the money.

26:34.819 --> 26:36.738
[groaning]

26:36.821 --> 26:39.532
Okay, it was about the money.

26:39.616 --> 26:41.784
But also, I...
I was trying to help you.

26:42.619 --> 26:44.787
You know what would've helped?

26:46.038 --> 26:48.333
Some fucking support.

26:48.416 --> 26:52.254
Did you ask me how I feel,
what I want, huh?

26:52.337 --> 26:55.298
How you feel is what ruins it.

26:55.382 --> 26:57.675
I loved you.

26:57.759 --> 26:59.344
I wanted you around me.

26:59.427 --> 27:03.055
And now here you are,
doing the same stupid shit I did.

27:03.139 --> 27:04.849
[whimpering]

27:05.350 --> 27:06.809
[Aleida] I tried, you know?

27:07.977 --> 27:10.313
But it was for nothing.

27:10.397 --> 27:12.274
You turned out just like me.

27:13.858 --> 27:16.778
I made kids,
and then I fucked them up.

27:21.533 --> 27:22.950
I'm a terrible mother.

27:25.662 --> 27:29.666
And I never want you
to feel how I feel.

27:35.630 --> 27:36.923
I don't believe you.

27:37.924 --> 27:42.053
This kid was never...
was never nothing but a paycheck to you.

27:43.638 --> 27:48.142
I swallowed your bullshit
for the last fucking time.

27:48.225 --> 27:50.562
[groaning] My hips are coming apart.

27:54.357 --> 27:58.110
Think about floating in the ocean.
[exhaling]

27:58.194 --> 27:59.446
Fuck off, Maritza!

27:59.529 --> 28:00.822
Fuck!

28:00.905 --> 28:02.365
What?

28:04.451 --> 28:07.119
What? Is this normal?

28:07.203 --> 28:08.330
That does not seem normal.

28:09.331 --> 28:10.832
Somebody help!
She's bleeding!

28:10.915 --> 28:12.584
[Dayanara groaning]

28:16.421 --> 28:17.964
Fuck.
Call an ambulance!

28:18.047 --> 28:20.425
- [Gloria] Okay, come on, mija.
- Thank you, Gloria.

28:22.427 --> 28:23.845
Gloria's coming with me, right?

28:30.142 --> 28:32.019
[kids chattering]

28:38.735 --> 28:41.529
Dayanara, Mommy's here.

28:42.530 --> 28:43.573
Just a minute!

28:43.656 --> 28:46.368
I said, Mommy's here.
Ain't you glad to see me?

28:48.661 --> 28:51.456
- Bye.
- [girls] Bye.

28:54.917 --> 28:57.044
[straining]

28:57.128 --> 28:58.796
Come on,
let's go get your stuff.

28:58.880 --> 28:59.881
Who did your hair?

28:59.964 --> 29:02.008
Stacy. She did it just like hers!

29:02.091 --> 29:03.259
Oh.

29:04.594 --> 29:05.720
Did you have a good time?

29:05.803 --> 29:07.304
It's so fun!

29:07.389 --> 29:09.974
I made three best friends
and six regular friends,

29:10.057 --> 29:11.893
and I learned how to swim like a frog!

29:11.976 --> 29:13.310
That's great, baby.

29:13.395 --> 29:17.982
And Jordache says that I can sleep over
at her house whenever I want!

29:18.065 --> 29:21.277
Jordache? Someone named
their kid after pants?

29:21.361 --> 29:23.571
Come on, I have to show you
arts and crafts.

29:23.655 --> 29:25.407
Okay, okay.

29:25.490 --> 29:27.409
Stacy, my mom came!

29:27.492 --> 29:30.244
- Hey, Mrs. Diaz!
- It's "Ms."

29:30.327 --> 29:32.121
Oh, sure.

29:32.204 --> 29:35.332
Well, I have to tell you,
Daya's had an amazing month.

29:35.417 --> 29:39.253
At first, she was pretty shy,
but then she just blossomed.

29:39.336 --> 29:42.382
- Can I come back next year?
- We can talk about it.

29:42.465 --> 29:45.885
Oh, and check out some of her artwork.

29:45.968 --> 29:47.554
Tell your mom what
you're thinking about

29:47.637 --> 29:50.848
for your career goal
for when you're a grown-up?

29:50.932 --> 29:53.100
Mommy, I wanna be an artist.

29:53.184 --> 29:56.479
That and a token
will get you on the subway.

29:58.898 --> 30:01.317
That's really great, baby.
Really great.

30:01.401 --> 30:02.735
We gotta go now.

30:02.819 --> 30:03.861
Jazmina needs her car back

30:03.945 --> 30:05.572
so she could sell the radios
out of the trunk.

30:06.698 --> 30:09.241
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you, too.

30:17.709 --> 30:19.335
[groaning]

31:07.091 --> 31:09.469
[indistinct walkie chatter]

31:10.553 --> 31:11.638
[whispers] You're not supposed
to be in here.

31:11.721 --> 31:14.891
We're not supposed to do
a lot of things, but...

31:14.974 --> 31:17.018
business is business, right?

31:17.101 --> 31:19.270
Is this about earlier?

31:19.353 --> 31:22.649
Look, this may be weird for you.

31:24.191 --> 31:25.902
I get it.

31:25.985 --> 31:29.196
But when I make a vaguely-worded,
insinuated promise...

31:30.364 --> 31:32.700
I do my best to keep it.

31:32.784 --> 31:36.328
Especially if I...
basically have no other choice.

31:36.412 --> 31:38.956
No, no, no, no, no.
I... I don't want anything from you.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.000
The whole thing has just been
stressing me out, okay?

31:41.083 --> 31:43.169
I don't like breaking the rules.
I get sweaty all the time.

31:43.252 --> 31:46.213
I had to take a beta blocker.
It's not worth it for me.

31:46.297 --> 31:49.050
- Oh...
- Chapman, don't.

31:49.967 --> 31:51.761
No way this kid gets a handjob off you.

31:51.844 --> 31:53.179
[Piper] Right, well,
actually it turns out...

31:53.262 --> 31:56.223
Listen, you quivering,
Michael Cera-looking sack of squid bits.

31:56.307 --> 31:58.893
You think an opportunity like this
comes along every day?

31:58.976 --> 32:00.728
What? No, no.
I don't care about the money.

32:00.812 --> 32:02.814
Fuck no,
you don't care about the money.

32:02.897 --> 32:04.857
What you care about is that
you're illegally smuggling

32:04.941 --> 32:06.943
women's panties out of a women's prison.

32:07.026 --> 32:11.322
A story that is gonna get you
free beer at any bar you choose

32:11.405 --> 32:14.826
for the rest of your pathetic
anti-climax of a life.

32:14.909 --> 32:19.121
This caper is the most interesting
goddamn thing that's ever happened to you.

32:20.081 --> 32:21.290
[sighs]

32:22.959 --> 32:24.043
Okay.

32:24.126 --> 32:25.837
Okay, good.

32:27.504 --> 32:29.215
- Come on.
- Hey, wait...

32:29.298 --> 32:31.383
I was gonna get a handjob out of this?

32:50.987 --> 32:53.781
Think you can slide in
a few good words for me?

32:53.865 --> 32:56.158
In between the widows
and orphans or whatever.

32:56.242 --> 33:00.287
Nothing like dark days to bring a person
running back to the church.

33:00.371 --> 33:04.458
[sighs]
I was never in the church.

33:04.541 --> 33:08.004
Well, you sure were interested when you
were having problems, then...

33:08.087 --> 33:11.883
things got better and... poof.

33:11.966 --> 33:17.013
No offense...
but I was jumped in my salon yesterday.

33:17.096 --> 33:19.807
I don't have a lot left over
for your hurt feelings.

33:19.891 --> 33:21.726
I was minding my own business.

33:21.809 --> 33:25.437
[sighs] I'm here...

33:25.521 --> 33:28.858
because I realized
you might be my only friend.

33:30.943 --> 33:35.197
[sighs deeply]
I'm sorry, Sophia.

33:35.782 --> 33:38.701
Everybody acts cool
most of the time, you know?

33:39.827 --> 33:42.747
"Oh, Sophia, hit me with the gossip."

33:42.830 --> 33:44.498
"What do you think about bangs, Sophia?"

33:44.581 --> 33:48.169
You start to feel like one of the girls.

33:48.252 --> 33:53.382
But then something turns...
and you realize...

33:53.465 --> 33:57.762
you're still a freak
and you'll never be one of them.

33:57.845 --> 34:01.683
Jesus said, "But I say to you,
love your enemies and...

34:01.766 --> 34:03.184
[inhales deeply]

34:03.267 --> 34:05.561
Pray for those who persecute you."

34:05.645 --> 34:09.481
Nothin' about disemboweling your enemies
with a hot curling iron?

34:09.565 --> 34:11.775
[chuckles] You'd think, right?

34:13.152 --> 34:16.906
Especially since he had it
pretty rough there at the end.

34:16.989 --> 34:18.489
But he went quietly.

34:18.574 --> 34:22.829
He should've kicked a few nutsacks
inside out while he had the chance.

34:22.911 --> 34:24.871
[chuckling] Oh, I don't know.

34:26.748 --> 34:28.042
[sighs]

34:28.960 --> 34:31.087
Assuming you're beat,
at least for the moment,

34:31.170 --> 34:34.465
I wouldn't give them the satisfaction
of watching you unravel.

34:36.132 --> 34:39.094
Also, as a former protest junkie...

34:40.554 --> 34:43.514
when you go ape-shit,
it gives them a reason to fight you.

34:43.599 --> 34:47.518
I like to get real quiet
and look them in the face, like...

34:48.855 --> 34:50.857
"I'll remember you later."

34:52.149 --> 34:54.735
Freaks them out.
They go bonkers.

34:55.695 --> 34:57.029
That's all you got?

34:57.112 --> 34:59.240
[sighs]

35:11.878 --> 35:15.464
So now she's accusing us of skimping
on training for the new guards,

35:15.547 --> 35:18.550
which, let's be honest,
isn't exactly untrue.

35:18.634 --> 35:21.095
[scoffing] You're saying
she's threatening us?

35:21.178 --> 35:22.388
What do you want me to do, Dad?

35:23.472 --> 35:25.099
What we did in Arizona.

35:25.182 --> 35:28.352
Some time alone.
Let her clear her head.

35:29.020 --> 35:30.354
She hasn't done anything wrong.

35:30.437 --> 35:34.066
Well, of course not, but we can't
weed out all the bullies.

35:35.735 --> 35:37.278
It's for her own protection.

35:39.405 --> 35:40.614
What about when she gets out?

35:40.697 --> 35:43.826
I mean, what do you think happens then?
Think about the long term.

35:43.910 --> 35:46.203
Nobody cares about the long term, Danny.

35:47.538 --> 35:49.957
Look, a year from now,

35:50.041 --> 35:54.045
Huey Strath will be CEO of CCA

35:54.128 --> 35:57.214
or fucking Best Western
or some other company.

35:57.298 --> 36:01.385
All the top guys get traded around like
baseball cards, you know that.

36:01.468 --> 36:05.139
The important thing is that
we nail this quarter and the next one

36:05.222 --> 36:07.516
and let everyone collect their bonuses.

36:08.810 --> 36:11.687
I'm so grossed out right now.

36:11.771 --> 36:13.314
This isn't who we are.

36:13.397 --> 36:16.733
Spare me the speech, please.

36:20.737 --> 36:24.575
We do what we do or someone else does.
It's not personal.

36:24.658 --> 36:26.285
Is that what Mom would say?

36:27.494 --> 36:29.956
What do you think of this one, Ma?

36:34.168 --> 36:35.211
[Jack] Shit.

36:39.465 --> 36:41.508
- Fine.
- Really?

36:41.592 --> 36:43.510
Go back to Utica.

36:45.221 --> 36:48.933
We'll meet tomorrow, talk to the board...
go over our options.

36:49.016 --> 36:50.434
Thank you.

36:50.517 --> 36:51.978
Thanks, Dad.

36:58.025 --> 36:59.443
[Red] Ha!

36:59.526 --> 37:03.072
Guess the floors are mopping
themselves now, huh?

37:03.155 --> 37:04.907
Red, check this.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.120
You got a fairy godmother
we don't know about? [scoffs]

37:09.203 --> 37:10.746
Abracadabra.

37:28.472 --> 37:30.850
[Caputo] I sent the cards
off yesterday, priority.

37:30.933 --> 37:31.934
And once they get them,

37:32.018 --> 37:35.187
they'll send a rep down
and we'll elect our union leaders.

37:35.271 --> 37:36.981
[O'Neill] I feel like the leaders
are pretty obvious.

37:37.899 --> 37:39.775
Do you?

37:39.859 --> 37:41.693
Yeah, people who've been there
since the beginning, you know?

37:41.777 --> 37:42.778
People who started the whole thing.

37:42.862 --> 37:46.823
The ones who made the reservation
at the bar for the first meeting.

37:46.908 --> 37:49.743
Red-blooded, hard-working, solid people.

37:50.702 --> 37:53.330
I don't know, O'Neill.

37:53.414 --> 37:55.457
Look, I'm obviously one of the leaders.

37:55.541 --> 37:58.210
It means we got the white guy
demographic covered.

37:58.294 --> 38:01.005
We gotta be sure to include a spectrum.

38:01.088 --> 38:03.090
A spectrum.
So, you're talking about Maxwell?

38:03.174 --> 38:06.260
Sir, she's got the leadership qualities
of a goddamn dish sponge.

38:06.343 --> 38:07.428
Or Ford.

38:07.511 --> 38:09.721
Do not be taken in by the fact
that he's a total hunk, sir.

38:09.805 --> 38:13.434
Ford knits in his spare time,
like a grandma.

38:13.517 --> 38:16.520
That's not relevant.
The relevant thing is that he's black!

38:17.604 --> 38:21.150
Black people get everything.
I gotta piss.

38:22.944 --> 38:24.445
Now?

38:24.528 --> 38:26.948
We just passed the piss rock.

38:27.031 --> 38:29.533
It's where we pee when we gotta pee
when we're walking the perimeter.

38:29.616 --> 38:32.494
It's like... a Pavlovian thing now.

38:34.371 --> 38:36.040
I wouldn't have thought
Ford was your type.

38:36.123 --> 38:37.291
He's not my type.

38:37.374 --> 38:40.336
He's just a beautiful man.
It's empirical.

38:41.503 --> 38:43.380
Holy...

38:43.464 --> 38:46.633
- O'Neill, get over here.
- I'm indisposed.

38:46.717 --> 38:50.930
There's a fucking...
chicken over here.

38:51.013 --> 38:52.598
[O'Neill] The chicken is a myth.
Nice try, sir.

38:52.681 --> 38:54.350
I'm serious.
It's real!

38:54.433 --> 38:55.726
It's got a beak and feathers!

38:55.809 --> 38:57.728
It's pecking,
it's pecking in the grass, it...

38:57.811 --> 38:59.939
Okay, show me.

39:05.027 --> 39:06.070
Went in the bushes.

39:06.153 --> 39:08.155
We know you've been
under a lot of stress recently,

39:08.239 --> 39:10.449
- but the chicken is not a real thing...
- Shut up, O'Neill.

39:10.532 --> 39:12.368
[sighs]

39:15.704 --> 39:17.706
Look at this.

39:24.630 --> 39:27.174
I feel like we're in Narnia.

39:36.725 --> 39:37.726
[clears throat]

39:39.520 --> 39:40.896
[phone ringing]

39:43.690 --> 39:44.858
Hello?

39:47.819 --> 39:49.696
Yes, yes, yes, I accept.

39:49.780 --> 39:53.784
Dayanara? It's funny, I was...
I was just putting diapers away.

39:53.867 --> 39:56.328
- Are you okay?
- It's her mother.

39:56.412 --> 39:57.621
Oh.

39:57.704 --> 40:00.249
Mrs. Diaz, how's she doing?

40:01.250 --> 40:02.793
Not so good.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.837
The baby came this morning.

40:05.921 --> 40:09.175
He had the cord wrapped around his neck.

40:11.677 --> 40:13.679
So, so, it's a boy?

40:13.762 --> 40:15.306
Yeah.

40:19.601 --> 40:20.852
He died.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.148
Oh, my God.

40:25.941 --> 40:29.320
I wanted to tell you,
one grandma to another.

40:34.075 --> 40:36.243
Who was her doctor?

40:36.327 --> 40:40.497
I don't know anything about...
prison medical standards, but...

40:40.581 --> 40:42.583
It wasn't anyone's fault.

40:42.666 --> 40:44.626
It was just one of those things,
you know?

40:44.710 --> 40:47.421
Can I see her?

40:47.504 --> 40:48.630
Sure, sure.

40:49.923 --> 40:53.594
But not right away.
It's gonna take her a while.

40:53.677 --> 40:55.846
Sure, I understand.

40:57.931 --> 40:59.850
I'll write to her.

41:01.268 --> 41:02.603
Christ.

41:03.937 --> 41:06.565
I'm so sorry.

41:07.816 --> 41:10.652
I'm...
I'm so sorry, too.

41:27.544 --> 41:28.920
It smells funny in here.

41:29.004 --> 41:30.631
Put your suitcase away.

41:52.944 --> 41:54.321
That's my art.

41:54.405 --> 41:56.323
There's a lot.

41:56.407 --> 41:58.367
We have enough clutter around here.

41:58.450 --> 41:59.785
But I made it.

41:59.868 --> 42:01.995
Only 'cause they told you to.

42:02.078 --> 42:04.831
But now you can make new stuff,
your own stuff.

42:09.961 --> 42:12.381
I missed you so much.

42:13.674 --> 42:16.427
- Did you miss me?
- Yes.

42:16.510 --> 42:19.430
Maybe that camp was a mistake, huh?

42:19.513 --> 42:23.475
Maybe it was too hard for you
to be without your mommy for so long.

42:25.977 --> 42:27.979
It was kind of boring anyway.

42:28.063 --> 42:30.316
I knew you'd be bored.

42:30.399 --> 42:32.734
You love your Judge Judy,
don't you?

42:32.818 --> 42:35.696
And we had to sing
those dumb songs before dinner.

42:38.031 --> 42:40.284
You liked Stacy, though.

42:41.993 --> 42:45.872
Whatever, she had this stupid crush
on one of the boy counselors.

42:45.956 --> 42:48.250
It was kind of desperate.

42:48.334 --> 42:51.212
Bitches be like that.
Don't matter where they're from.

42:51.295 --> 42:53.547
Yeah, bitches.

43:01.763 --> 43:05.016
So, you really wanna be an artist?

43:06.101 --> 43:09.188
Nah, I wanna be a mom.

43:09.271 --> 43:11.106
[baby cooing]

43:12.774 --> 43:15.068
Here you go, there, little pretty girl.

43:16.278 --> 43:18.572
- Do you wanna see her?
- Yeah.

43:18.655 --> 43:21.408
Here you go. Here.

43:25.454 --> 43:28.290
Baby. Hi, little baby.

43:28.374 --> 43:29.833
[shushing]

43:37.799 --> 43:40.427
I love you.
You know that?

43:40.511 --> 43:43.096
I love you.

43:44.348 --> 43:47.809
My job is so weird.

44:09.831 --> 44:11.375
[inhales deeply]

44:12.793 --> 44:14.085
[exhales]

44:17.673 --> 44:21.260
It's like you're Madame Curie, but stupid.

44:21.343 --> 44:23.387
It's a chemical composition.

44:23.470 --> 44:25.431
We crack it,
we can churn out more product.

44:25.514 --> 44:29.351
Without involving anyone else.
We add to Piper's profit margin!

44:29.435 --> 44:30.977
It's not ethical.

44:31.061 --> 44:33.063
We're selling crusty jail panties
to perverts.

44:33.146 --> 44:34.940
Yeah, but we have our integrity.

44:35.023 --> 44:37.484
We gotta get out of Carol's house, dude.

44:37.568 --> 44:38.944
My soul is dying.

44:39.027 --> 44:40.654
Oh, come on, it's not so bad.

44:40.737 --> 44:42.823
Cal, the doilies!

44:42.906 --> 44:44.991
Touché.

44:45.075 --> 44:46.702
- [sighs]
- Look, this is never gonna work.

44:46.785 --> 44:50.872
The tuna thing is a dead giveaway.
Give me this.

44:50.956 --> 44:52.749
Yeah, it's just all fish.
There's no nuance.

44:52.833 --> 44:54.250
Well, sure.

44:54.335 --> 44:56.753
You should know.
[chuckles] I mean...

44:56.837 --> 45:00.215
you do know what a vagina smells like.

45:02.426 --> 45:04.511
Right, sweetie?

45:06.805 --> 45:10.141
Obviously, I do.

45:10.225 --> 45:12.143
Obviously.

45:12.227 --> 45:14.813
Oh, my God.

45:14.896 --> 45:17.358
Please don't think less of me.

45:17.441 --> 45:20.777
You went to Vassar!
You lived in campus housing!

45:20.861 --> 45:23.697
It was dark times.
Our nation was at war!

45:23.780 --> 45:25.824
Whoa, okay, I never thought
I would say this...

45:27.033 --> 45:28.827
but this is not Dick Cheney's fault.

45:28.910 --> 45:32.789
So, are none of your stories true?
[stutters] The repressed Pakistani girl?

45:32.873 --> 45:34.833
The three-way with Georgia Pellegrini?

45:34.916 --> 45:37.085
I wanted you to think I was cool.

45:37.168 --> 45:38.754
[whimpers]

45:46.261 --> 45:47.763
[sighs] Okay.

45:48.722 --> 45:52.893
First... we gotta get some miso.

45:54.936 --> 46:00.567
To lay down a nice umami base note.
Then we can go from there.

46:04.405 --> 46:05.406
[squeals]

46:05.489 --> 46:07.449
- I'm heartbroken.
- I know. I'm sorry.

46:07.533 --> 46:09.993
I loved that Georgia Pellegrini
three-way story.

46:10.076 --> 46:11.453
I'm sorry.

46:11.537 --> 46:13.622
[classical music playing on radio]

46:15.874 --> 46:19.586
- I hope everyone has enjoyed the soup.
- [all moan]

46:19.670 --> 46:21.672
[Anita] Bravo!
[Lorna] Oh, my God, yes.

46:21.755 --> 46:23.089
Thank you.

46:23.173 --> 46:26.593
Now, this, uh, might sound
a little corny, but...

46:26.677 --> 46:28.053
ears to you.

46:28.136 --> 46:29.179
[all] Aw...
[Lorna] Huh?

46:29.262 --> 46:31.014
- [all laughing]
- [inmate] Yeah, bravo!

46:31.097 --> 46:33.308
One more pun,
and it goes away.

46:33.391 --> 46:35.185
It's truly amazing, Red.

46:35.268 --> 46:36.562
Thank you.

46:36.645 --> 46:37.646
[Anita] Whoo!

46:38.480 --> 46:41.483
I kind of want to take off
all my clothes.

46:41.567 --> 46:42.693
[Anita laughing]

46:43.527 --> 46:44.528
Yippee!

46:52.703 --> 46:55.622
I heard you called it off with Chapman.

46:55.706 --> 46:59.125
Yeah, I don't know what it means.
[chuckles]

46:59.209 --> 47:01.127
You ever have a thing with someone that...

47:01.211 --> 47:03.714
never seems to really be over,
even when it is?

47:03.797 --> 47:07.676
Rumi says, "Lovers never meet.

47:07.759 --> 47:11.012
They're in each other all along."

47:12.556 --> 47:16.267
Yeah, it's kind of like that,
only with drugs and backstabbing.

47:18.895 --> 47:20.897
Oh, garçon!

47:20.981 --> 47:22.398
[all laughing]

47:22.483 --> 47:28.154
Corn and leek quiche
with a fried sage garnish.

47:29.364 --> 47:31.074
I love everybody.

47:31.157 --> 47:32.659
[all laughing]

47:32.743 --> 47:33.744
Oh.

47:37.122 --> 47:38.331
[Red] Eat up, Chang.

47:41.543 --> 47:43.837
- This is so good!
- [Anita] Salud!

47:43.920 --> 47:45.463
Mmm!

48:10.113 --> 48:11.948
[chuckles]

48:13.324 --> 48:15.577
[indistinct chatter]

48:26.046 --> 48:27.130
Keep walking.

48:28.423 --> 48:29.716
[sighs]

48:30.592 --> 48:32.636
[Black Cindy] You so gangsta.

48:34.054 --> 48:35.513
[sighs sharply]

48:38.099 --> 48:39.142
Man.

48:39.225 --> 48:41.394
What are you gettin'
all blinky about now?

48:41.477 --> 48:44.189
It's Chapter Nine of the Time Hump saga.

48:44.272 --> 48:45.481
I thought you quit that rag.

48:45.566 --> 48:47.525
That's the thing.
I didn't write it.

48:47.609 --> 48:49.820
I found it in the bathroom.

48:49.903 --> 48:52.447
They go through a wormhole
and when they come out,

48:52.530 --> 48:55.617
they meet sexy vampires.

48:55.701 --> 48:58.745
Vampires are derivative.

48:58.829 --> 49:01.372
Look, if bitches is copying you,

49:01.456 --> 49:03.416
it's because they like what you did.

49:03.499 --> 49:06.377
They didn't want it to end,
so they made it their own shit.

49:06.461 --> 49:08.254
It's called fan fiction.

49:09.130 --> 49:11.174
Kind of like the New Testament,
am I right?

49:11.257 --> 49:15.345
You don't wanna go be
throwin' shade at other folks' religion.

49:15.428 --> 49:18.181
They get bacon and Christmas,
I think they can handle it.

49:18.264 --> 49:19.850
I'm offended.

49:19.933 --> 49:21.852
[scoffs] What is this? 1936?

49:21.935 --> 49:24.730
Don't make me come back there,
Cindy, I swear to God!

49:24.813 --> 49:28.149
- Fan fiction is cheapening my legacy!
- Just breathe.

49:28.233 --> 49:30.861
Yo, Jefferson.

49:30.944 --> 49:33.864
This is the third day this week
I caught your girl Watson

49:33.947 --> 49:37.367
washing her sweaty socks
out in the bathroom sink.

49:37.450 --> 49:39.119
It ain't fucking civilized.

49:39.202 --> 49:43.498
Why are you telling me about it?
Work it out with her.

49:43.581 --> 49:45.959
You think I haven't tried?

49:46.042 --> 49:49.921
[scoffs] It's not the being told
to fuck myself I mind so much...

49:50.005 --> 49:53.091
it's more the poking.

49:53.174 --> 49:58.596
And I'd like to avoid fighting her,
because I'm not sure I'd win.

49:59.514 --> 50:01.767
But I'm not sure I'd lose, either.

50:01.850 --> 50:04.853
I still don't see how this is my problem.

50:09.733 --> 50:11.234
Hold up...

50:12.610 --> 50:14.112
am I the mom?

50:15.446 --> 50:18.033
Oh, my God.

50:19.450 --> 50:20.911
I'm the mom?

50:22.663 --> 50:25.415
My moms moved to Tucson
with her boyfriend,

50:25.498 --> 50:29.127
so I got my cousin Jazmina
to go to the hospital.

50:29.210 --> 50:31.421
She's next of kin.

50:31.504 --> 50:34.132
She can hand the baby over to Cesar.

50:34.215 --> 50:36.342
Dayanara's gonna kill you.

50:37.678 --> 50:40.096
I talked her into the whole thing, right?

50:40.180 --> 50:42.598
At least now I got
nothing on my conscious.

50:45.643 --> 50:47.688
You really think that man can
handle another one?

50:47.771 --> 50:50.440
It's like the Muppet Babies
up in his house.

50:50.523 --> 50:54.444
He'll just slide another girl on his dick,
make her help out.

50:54.527 --> 50:57.280
- What, like he ain't fuckin' other people?
- [Gloria laughs]

50:57.363 --> 51:00.200
We all know what happens out there.
He gotta do what he gotta do.

51:01.284 --> 51:05.205
Man, you ever feel like, you know,
maybe one time in my life,

51:05.288 --> 51:08.875
the shit I gotta do could be
the shit that makes me happy?

51:10.085 --> 51:13.129
No, 'cause I ain't a greedy fuck like you.

51:15.423 --> 51:17.508
[laughs]

51:18.634 --> 51:20.095
I'll tell you what, though.

51:21.179 --> 51:22.723
I'm an abuela now.

51:22.806 --> 51:24.099
Mmm.

51:24.182 --> 51:26.642
At least now,
I got a chance to do somethin' right.

51:26.727 --> 51:27.769
[chuckles]

51:27.853 --> 51:30.772
Or maybe do it a little less shitty.

51:33.399 --> 51:34.484
[Gloria laughs]

51:38.654 --> 51:40.115
[groaning]

52:03.554 --> 52:07.392
[Big Boo] Oh, God, he's a heavy fucker.
Easy.

52:07.475 --> 52:09.060
- Come on.
- [both grunting]

52:11.980 --> 52:13.398
[panting]

52:35.921 --> 52:37.839
Okay, go ahead.

52:37.923 --> 52:39.715
No, no, no, after you.

52:41.176 --> 52:42.886
Please... go.

52:42.969 --> 52:44.179
Get in there.

52:46.181 --> 52:49.225
This was your big Swedish idea.

52:49.309 --> 52:51.144
But you're the victim.

52:51.227 --> 52:52.437
[Pennsatucky sighs]

52:52.520 --> 52:56.024
Look, you get the ball rolling, okay?
It's not like I've ever done this before.

52:56.107 --> 52:57.650
And I have?

52:57.733 --> 52:59.777
Well, it definitely seemed like you had.

52:59.861 --> 53:02.864
You know, I've done some
deeply questionable shit in my life,

53:02.948 --> 53:06.117
but the foreign-object-ass-rape
of an unconscious man?

53:06.201 --> 53:07.994
Still not crossed off my list.

53:08.078 --> 53:12.874
Boo, this is fucking creepy,
and you know it, right?

53:12.958 --> 53:14.960
Yeah, of course, but...

53:15.043 --> 53:16.711
[sighs]

53:16.794 --> 53:18.839
Yeah, but I thought you'd wanna do it.

53:19.965 --> 53:21.466
This is my gift to you.

53:21.549 --> 53:24.719
It'll help you to work out
that rage and that anger.

53:24.802 --> 53:26.637
You know, hmm?

53:26.721 --> 53:27.931
[sighs]

53:29.474 --> 53:32.018
I don't have rage.
[laughs meekly]

53:36.397 --> 53:38.233
I'm just sad.

53:44.197 --> 53:45.949
[movie playing]

54:20.483 --> 54:23.403
You know...
the thing is...

54:25.155 --> 54:28.699
I don't think I'm very good
at being on my own.

54:31.077 --> 54:32.703
Neither am I.

54:33.914 --> 54:36.624
I really like you.

54:39.794 --> 54:42.047
I was thinking maybe we could be...

54:43.631 --> 54:44.799
partners.

54:47.302 --> 54:51.472
You know, like, in the business.
Like business partners.

54:55.977 --> 54:57.562
Oh, my God, you don't even...

54:57.645 --> 55:00.065
You don't even...
I shouldn't have said anything.

55:00.148 --> 55:02.525
No, it's not that.

55:02.608 --> 55:04.485
I'm getting out, Piper...

55:05.486 --> 55:07.113
on Tuesday.

55:11.326 --> 55:14.329
You're getting...
You're... Oh!

55:17.165 --> 55:18.166
Oh...

55:29.635 --> 55:30.678
Oh.

55:46.987 --> 55:48.446
[indistinct chatter]

56:18.518 --> 56:20.311
Oh, shit.

56:33.491 --> 56:36.411
Burset, you're coming with us.

56:36.494 --> 56:38.204
What the hell?

56:38.288 --> 56:40.040
Let's go, honey.

56:40.123 --> 56:42.333
You gotta tell me
what's going on.

56:44.419 --> 56:45.586
You're going to the SHU.

56:46.629 --> 56:47.963
For what?

56:48.881 --> 56:51.217
For your own protection.

56:52.635 --> 56:53.803
[Ford] Caputo got a call.

56:55.971 --> 56:58.599
[whispering] You must have
pissed off a pretty big dog.

56:58.683 --> 56:59.934
[scoffs]

57:00.017 --> 57:02.353
This is bullshit, you both know it.

57:02.437 --> 57:04.564
- Let's just get this over with.
- Don't touch me.

57:04.647 --> 57:05.981
Inmate.

57:18.786 --> 57:20.371
[exhales]

57:27.545 --> 57:28.713
Let's go, then.

57:29.922 --> 57:31.924
[blues song playing]

58:12.840 --> 58:14.259
[buzzer sounds]
