12:33.320 --> 12:35.147
It is conceivable
that the sensors picked up

12:35.320 --> 12:39.158
the after-image of an actual planet
on the other side of the wormhole.

12:39.360 --> 12:41.623
We could survey the nearby stars
for such a planet.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.984
It would require
approximately six days, sir.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.188
No, no, we don't have time for that.

12:46.360 --> 12:47.704
We've encountered
a minor mystery,

12:47.880 --> 12:50.190
one that has been solved
to my satisfaction.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.302
Number One,
unless there's a major objection,

12:52.480 --> 12:55.594
then Ensign McKnight should
put us back on course for Evadne IV.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.219
- No objection.
- Ensign.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.492
<i>McKNIGHT:
Aye, sir.</i>

13:06.600 --> 13:07.692
[DOOR CHIMES]

13:07.840 --> 13:09.092
<i>PICARD:
Come.</i>

13:11.400 --> 13:14.675
I have something
of a minor mystery on my hands.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.139
<i>PICARD:
A minor mystery?</i>

13:16.320 --> 13:20.043
That seems to be
a recurring phrase these days.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.786
Oh.

13:22.200 --> 13:26.291
Diomedian scarlet moss.

13:26.760 --> 13:28.828
I didn't know
you were an ethnobotanist.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.238
- It's a hobby.
- You've got a good crop here.

13:32.400 --> 13:35.112
As I recall, it's not easy to cultivate.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.579
That's just it.

13:36.760 --> 13:40.162
I started these spores right before
we were all knocked unconscious

13:40.320 --> 13:42.066
by the Wormhole.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.998
You said we were unconscious
for 30 seconds?

13:45.160 --> 13:46.217
Correct.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.434
Then why do these
show a full day's growth?

13:52.760 --> 13:55.679
Perhaps you've got some sort
of fast-growth strain here.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.103
Each of these incubators
was set with spores

13:58.280 --> 14:01.601
from completely different sources
in the Diomedian system.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.828
I have a dozen more in the lab.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.275
Perhaps something extraordinary
happened to one of them,

14:07.440 --> 14:08.899
but not to all of them.

14:09.080 --> 14:12.275
Doctor, we were not unconscious
for a whole day.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.152
Everything onboard indicates
that we were out for 30 seconds.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.423
The ship's chronometer,
the computer.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.795
Everything, doctor.
Including Commander Data.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.582
Jean-Luc,

14:23.760 --> 14:25.621
I'm telling you,

14:25.840 --> 14:30.046
this is over 24 hours of growth.

14:38.760 --> 14:40.346
<i>PICARD:
Captain's log, supplemental.</i>

14:40.560 --> 14:42.306
<i>Commander Data
continues to maintain</i>

14:42.520 --> 14:44.990
<i>that we were unconscious
for only 30 seconds</i>

14:45.160 --> 14:48.677
<i>despite Doctor Crusher's evidence
to the contrary.</i>

14:49.320 --> 14:53.078
Captain, I have a hypothesis.

14:53.800 --> 14:56.719
The 22nd century physicist
Pell Underhill

14:56.880 --> 15:00.155
conjectured that a major disruption
in time continuity

15:00.320 --> 15:04.365
could be compensated for
by trillions of counter reactions.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.473
That effect may have allowed
Dr. Crusher's moss

15:07.640 --> 15:09.824
to arrive at the other side
of the wormhole

15:10.000 --> 15:11.988
with the unanticipated growth.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.194
- Underhill was talking about energy.
<i>DATA: True.</i>

15:15.480 --> 15:17.502
Nevertheless, it is possible

15:17.675 --> 15:19.859
that the phenomenon
could occur in matter

15:20.080 --> 15:23.964
at higher levels of organization
given the proper conditions.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.025
Thank you, Data.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.061
Intriguing hypothesis.

15:29.600 --> 15:33.611
Well, perhaps we've got a tempest
in a test tube after all.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.863
- Captain...
- Data.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.819
I promised Mr. Nelson

15:38.040 --> 15:40.912
that you would assist him
with the sensor diagnostic.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.590
You'll find him hard at work
on Deck 36.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.782
As you wish, captain.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.177
Do you believe him?

16:02.880 --> 16:04.948
I want a frank answer, commander.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.384
Not for a second.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.951
I'm amazed he even proposed it.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.660
What are you suggesting, captain?

16:11.840 --> 16:13.139
I'm not sure, Mr. Worf.

16:13.360 --> 16:17.612
I have never known Data to tell a lie.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.137
And yet...

16:19.320 --> 16:21.917
If we never went through
that Wormhole,

16:22.120 --> 16:24.717
then what happened to us
during that day?

16:24.920 --> 16:28.437
If we were out for a whole day,
why didn't our beards grow?

16:28.600 --> 16:30.059
Whatever it was, it seems

16:30.240 --> 16:32.424
it was something
Data didn't wanna tell us about.

16:33.080 --> 16:37.849
It could be that whatever caused
this situation also affected Data.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.160
And it could be
that he's telling the truth.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.475
That this is all
just a minor mystery.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.485
I could always check
the computer's chronometer,

16:47.720 --> 16:49.387
see if there's any evidence
of tampering.

16:49.560 --> 16:52.111
A transporter trace analysis
might give us another indication

16:52.320 --> 16:55.078
of how much time
has actually passed.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.062
Doctor, commander, make it so.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.624
Meanwhile, we will maintain
our present course.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.752
If there is something wrong
with Data,

17:02.920 --> 17:06.356
we don't want him to be aware
of our suspicions.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.960
Gentlemen, how goes the battle?

17:16.119 --> 17:18.752
Long-range and infrared sensors
apparently suffered no ill effects

17:18.920 --> 17:20.506
as a result of the Wormhole.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.432
We are presently checking neutrino
and heavy particle detectors.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.019
Great.

17:25.200 --> 17:26.452
I'll take over now, Data.

17:26.640 --> 17:29.110
The captain wants you back
on the Bridge.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.504
See you later in Ten-Forward?

17:36.520 --> 17:40.197
Nelson, I need your help
with the computer.

17:43.160 --> 17:45.630
- Hello, chief. How's the elbow?
- Much better, thanks.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.340
This isn't a house call, is it?

17:47.520 --> 17:48.577
No, it's not.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.300
Tell me,

17:50.600 --> 17:53.205
do you remember
the last person to use the transporter

17:53.275 --> 17:54.750
before we went through
the Wormhole?

17:54.760 --> 17:56.461
Oh, let me check.

17:59.120 --> 18:02.073
Ensign Locklin.
She's one of my technicians.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.033
Tell her to report to Sickbay
immediately.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.270
<i>CRUSHER:

18:08.680 --> 18:10.783
Twelve-point-five deviation
from previous.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.908
Interesting.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.502
Check the cellular membranes.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.990
I'm willing to bet
that the inner turgor pressure is off

18:18.200 --> 18:20.463

Eleven-point-three deviation

Terrific.
That's what I wanted to hear.

18:25.160 --> 18:28.160
Thank you, Ensign Locklin.
That'll be all for now.

<i>I'm on my way to Engineering.

18:40.080 --> 18:43.435
Physiologically,
each of us is on a daily cycle.

18:43.640 --> 18:47.202
Our cells have developed rhythms
based on a 24-hour period.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.348
- Internal clock.
- Exactly.

18:49.560 --> 18:53.203
And I can measure that effect
at the molecular level.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.710
I took a trace from the last person
to use the transporter

18:55.880 --> 18:57.305
before the incident

18:57.480 --> 19:02.410
and compared her cell function levels
at that time to what they are right now.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.985
If we were unconscious
for only 30 seconds,

19:05.200 --> 19:07.912
those cycles
should be nearly synchronous.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.902
And were they?

19:10.240 --> 19:11.780
No.

19:12.280 --> 19:15.152
We were out for longer
than 30 seconds, captain.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.342
A lot longer.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.798
I've got some good news
and some bad news.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.415
Good news is we were right
about the computer's chronometer.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.635
There's a security program
to prevent tampering,

19:33.660 --> 19:37.490
but it looks now like it was disabled
and a new program put in its place.

19:37.640 --> 19:40.378
Someone has reset the clock.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.914
If that's the good news,
what's the bad news?

19:44.080 --> 19:48.171
That Data and I are the only ones
aboard this ship capable of doing it.

19:52.440 --> 19:54.750
It is a mystery, captain.

19:56.640 --> 19:59.145
That is an understatement, Data.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.788
Is it possible that someone

20:01.960 --> 20:06.212
or something could have affected you
without your knowing?

20:06.640 --> 20:09.593
I am unable
to answer that question, sir.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.020

to being examined

22:05.160 --> 22:08.918
Well, he still could be malfunctioning
beyond my ability to detect it.

22:09.080 --> 22:12.401
This entire mystery started
when our sensors detected that planet.

22:12.600 --> 22:14.588
First it was Class-M, now it isn't.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.139
Our sensors were malfunctioning,

22:16.320 --> 22:20.250
but our probe clearly established
the planet could not support life.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.301
Data launched that probe.

22:22.520 --> 22:24.428
If he rigged it, could you prove it?

22:24.600 --> 22:26.461
I could try.

22:28.280 --> 22:30.005

25:10.960 --> 25:13.592
But the captain ordered us
to report anything out of the ordinary.

[DEVICE BEEPING]

25:19.440 --> 25:22.152
How did this happen?

25:26.480 --> 25:29.433
Do you recognize this planet, Data?

25:30.560 --> 25:36.145
Yes, sir. It is the planet our probes
detected in the T-Tauri system.

25:36.280 --> 25:38.188
<i>LA FORGE:
No, it's not.</i>

25:40.120 --> 25:42.108
Actually, it's Tethys III.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.877
I retrieved this image
from the ship's library.

25:45.040 --> 25:47.362
Its geophysical features
have been slightly altered,

25:47.400 --> 25:50.640
but it's definitely Tethys III.

25:50.645 --> 25:54.050
Strange that an obscure planet
hundreds of light years from here

25:54.060 --> 25:56.082
should be picked up by the probe.

25:58.960 --> 26:03.005
Data, did you take this image
from the ship's library

26:03.200 --> 26:05.958
and program the probe
to send it back to us?

26:06.800 --> 26:09.144
I cannot verify that hypothesis.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.423
But you don't deny it.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.620
No, sir.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.177
Mr. La Forge,

26:16.360 --> 26:19.153
will you send another probe
to the T-Tauri system?

26:19.320 --> 26:20.906
Yes, sir.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.022
I'm sorry, Data.

26:30.680 --> 26:35.770
Counselor Troi has just had
a very disturbing hallucination.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.874
- Is she all right, sir?
- For the moment.

26:41.040 --> 26:45.292
Can you tell me if Deanna's incident
is related in any way

26:45.440 --> 26:48.554
to this missing time period?

26:49.360 --> 26:50.533
No, sir, I cannot.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.662
Data, you are the key
to this entire mystery.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.512
And you have done nothing
but block my every attempt to solve it.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.059
Why are you fighting me?

26:57.400 --> 26:59.227
It is not by choice.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.388
What do you mean by that?

27:01.640 --> 27:03.226
I cannot say.

27:03.400 --> 27:06.193
Would you rather endanger Deanna,
a friend and colleague,

27:06.360 --> 27:08.382
than tell me what is going on?

27:10.880 --> 27:12.868
Which would you place first?

27:13.040 --> 27:17.487
The welfare of a single individual
or that of the entire crew?

27:18.880 --> 27:22.684
Are you saying that by not cooperating
you are actually protecting us?

27:22.960 --> 27:25.028
I am not saying that at all.

27:25.240 --> 27:28.595
I merely state
a possible alternative explanation.

27:30.280 --> 27:35.417
Then, Mr. Data,
I'm going to ask you again.

27:39.840 --> 27:43.483
And I order you
to directly answer me.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.864
What really happened to us?

27:46.440 --> 27:48.624
I cannot answer that.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.510
What would you have me do, Data?

27:55.200 --> 27:58.038
How would you handle this
if our positions were reversed?

28:00.720 --> 28:04.972
I am apparently guilty
of falsifying the <i>Enterprise's</i> records.

28:05.560 --> 28:08.318
Of interfering with an investigation.

28:08.600 --> 28:13.254
Of disobeying a direct order
from my commanding officer.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.431
Your duty seems clear, sir.

28:17.760 --> 28:20.632
Do you know
what a court martial would mean?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.993
Your career in Starfleet
would be finished.

28:24.560 --> 28:26.502
I realize that, sir.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.177
Do you also realize

28:28.360 --> 28:30.623
that you would most likely
be stripped down to your wires

28:30.800 --> 28:33.029
to find out
what the hell has gone wrong?

28:33.560 --> 28:36.432
Yes, sir. I do.

28:44.320 --> 28:46.102
<i>CRUSHER:
This wrist has been broken.</i>

28:46.320 --> 28:47.619
Broken and reset and treated

28:47.800 --> 28:51.558
with one of our own
subcutaneous bone fusion units.

28:51.720 --> 28:55.282
- During the missing day?
- That's the only possibility.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.472
Are you suggesting
he was conscious?

28:58.640 --> 29:01.318
I'm suggesting
that maybe we all were.

29:01.480 --> 29:05.157
I certainly didn't repair a broken wrist
while I was unconscious.

29:05.800 --> 29:08.995
<i>PICARD: Our memories of that day?
CRUSHER: Blocked.</i>

29:09.480 --> 29:12.031
- Possibly erased.
- By whom?

29:13.000 --> 29:14.827
There are
very few individuals onboard

29:15.000 --> 29:17.551
who could have broken my wrist.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.472
Commander Data
is one of those individuals.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.667
I can't accept that explanation.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.265
Well, he does possess
the speed and the strength.

29:25.440 --> 29:26.980
Granted.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.618
But I'm beginning to suspect

29:28.800 --> 29:31.558
that Commander Data
is refusing to cooperate

29:31.720 --> 29:35.524
because he believes that he's acting
in the best interest of the <i>Enterprise</i>.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.220
<i>LA FORGE:
La Forge to Captain Picard.</i>

29:37.360 --> 29:38.417
Go ahead, Geordi.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.180
<i>Our probe
is approaching the planet, sir.</i>

29:40.320 --> 29:43.354
Acknowledged. Maybe now
we'll get some answers.

29:49.360 --> 29:52.715
- What do you have, Mr. La Forge?
- Visuals available now, captain.

29:52.880 --> 29:57.247
M-class. Nickel-iron core,
nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere.

29:58.240 --> 30:02.894
Same planet our sensors picked up
before the so-called wormhole.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.097
Affirmative.

30:04.320 --> 30:07.273
No indication of any space-time
distortion whatsoever.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.784
The probe should at least be detecting
some residual effect

30:09.960 --> 30:11.787
even if the wormhole is inactive.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.594
That's because there is no Wormhole.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.305
- There never was.
<i>RIKER: Sir?</i>

30:19.520 --> 30:21.990
It was a ruse,
designed to throw us off the track.

30:22.160 --> 30:23.619
Look at the clues.

30:23.840 --> 30:28.126
Dr. Crusher's incubation experiment,
computer clock, transporter trace.

30:28.280 --> 30:31.842
All indicate the existence
of a missing day.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.636
Lieutenant Worf's broken wrist
would seem to suggest

30:36.120 --> 30:40.889
that we were awake
and aware for that day.

30:41.160 --> 30:43.423
Possibly in a struggle for our lives.

30:43.680 --> 30:46.599
The fact that we're still alive
suggests we might have won.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.346
<i>PICARD:
Not necessarily, doctor.</i>

30:48.520 --> 30:51.439
Data's behavior would seem to suggest
that we did not.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.232
Why else would he be willing
to sacrifice his career

30:54.400 --> 30:55.940
rather than tell the truth?

30:56.320 --> 30:59.641
But if we didn't win
and we didn't lose...?

30:59.800 --> 31:03.443
Then the only alternative
would be a stalemate.

31:03.960 --> 31:05.304
Maybe a compromise was reached.

31:05.480 --> 31:08.273
A compromise that forced Data
into this silence.

31:08.440 --> 31:09.899
Then maybe by uncovering all this,

31:10.080 --> 31:11.781
we run the risk
of upsetting the stalemate.

31:11.940 --> 31:13.505
Maybe we should leave
well enough alone.

31:13.515 --> 31:16.690
Possibly, Number One.
I'd be prepared to live with the mystery.

31:17.280 --> 31:20.359
But Data's role in this
must be ascertained

31:20.560 --> 31:23.111
or he'll never be trusted
with Starfleet duty again.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.114

of the crime, the T-Tauri system.

would put us all at grave risk.

their whereabouts.

to keep out invaders.

36:34.440 --> 36:38.163
The energy field stuns everyone
onboard the invading vessel

in a state of biochemical stasis.

36:41.480 --> 36:43.226

38:45.240 --> 38:47.918
You are aware of our existence.

38:48.080 --> 38:51.838
Our attempt to place you
in biochemical stasis has failed.

38:52.120 --> 38:55.199
We have no choice
but to destroy this ship.

38:56.560 --> 39:00.927
If you destroy this ship,
then others will come in search of us.

39:01.080 --> 39:02.585
You may not be able
to stop them all.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.920
Knowledge of your civilization
will be spread across half the galaxy.

39:06.080 --> 39:07.585
No.

39:08.920 --> 39:11.311
Allow us safe passage

39:11.480 --> 39:15.284
and I will protect your right to privacy
to the best of my ability.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.784
We will never tell anyone
of your existence.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.677
There are over 1000 life forms
on this vessel.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.231
How could you assure their silence?

39:25.800 --> 39:29.281
This biochemical stasis.

39:29.440 --> 39:31.624
Does it suppress
synaptic functions?

39:32.400 --> 39:33.779
It does.

39:33.960 --> 39:36.430
Then, you have the capability
of affecting memory.

39:36.640 --> 39:40.237
Can you erase the short-term memory
of everyone on this ship?

39:40.400 --> 39:42.951
Remove all knowledge of this event?

39:43.120 --> 39:45.590
Allow us to proceed
as if it had never happened?

39:46.160 --> 39:47.906
It would take time.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.712
One of your days.

39:52.520 --> 39:55.152
He is immune to our influence.

39:57.640 --> 40:01.283
Data, I'm going to give you
a most unusual order.

40:01.440 --> 40:05.887
I'm not sure that you will be able
to integrate it into your program.

40:06.040 --> 40:09.683
As a Starfleet officer, I am required
to follow all of your orders, captain.

40:09.880 --> 40:11.339
Good.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.912
Because our survival depends on it.

40:16.000 --> 40:21.699
I am ordering you never to reveal
what has happened here today.

40:21.840 --> 40:24.874
Not to Starfleet, not to myself.

40:25.680 --> 40:31.024
You will conceal your knowledge
of the Paxans for as long as you exist.

40:31.680 --> 40:34.277
Do you fully understand, Data?

40:34.440 --> 40:35.819
Completely, sir.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.579
Satisfactory?

40:40.160 --> 40:43.113
- Agreed.
- Good.

40:43.400 --> 40:47.893
Now, our task is to eliminate
from the ship's records any information

40:48.040 --> 40:51.235
that might lead to knowledge
of this incident.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.465
Let's get to work.

40:54.680 --> 40:58.082
We proceeded to erase all evidence
of our encounter with the Paxans.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.182
I reset the computer's chronometer,

41:00.360 --> 41:02.957
and again the crew was stunned
into unconsciousness.

41:03.120 --> 41:05.223
Their short-term memories erased.

41:05.440 --> 41:06.995
When they were revived a day later,

41:07.100 --> 41:10.655
computer adjustments made it appear
that only 30 seconds had passed.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.467
And here we are.

41:12.640 --> 41:15.754
- Here we are again.
<i>TROI: Your plan has failed.</i>

41:16.040 --> 41:18.062
This ship must be destroyed.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.337
No, wait!

41:19.520 --> 41:20.819
The plan failed

41:21.040 --> 41:24.557
because clues were left behind
that suggested a mystery.

41:24.720 --> 41:29.167
And to many humans,
a mystery is irresistible.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.906
It must be solved.

41:31.080 --> 41:36.217
The doctor's incubation experiment,
Worf's wrist, Troi's hallucinations.

41:36.360 --> 41:39.439
Little pieces of evidence
that suggested even more clues.

41:39.640 --> 41:45.305
The clock, the transporter trace,
Data's odd behavior.

41:45.480 --> 41:50.491
If we eliminate the clues
and begin again...

41:50.800 --> 41:52.467
- Again?
<i>PICARD: Yes.</i>

41:52.640 --> 41:55.881
Consider the first time
a run-through.

41:56.040 --> 41:59.235
A rehearsal
to shake out the flaws.

41:59.400 --> 42:03.686
The second time will succeed
if we leave no clues.

42:03.840 --> 42:07.276
You are a most unusual species.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.348
Worthy of a second chance.

42:09.520 --> 42:11.347
Proceed.

42:12.640 --> 42:13.697
[MOANS]

42:16.960 --> 42:18.178
Deanna?

42:23.800 --> 42:25.661
<i>PICARD:
Welcome back, counselor.</i>

42:26.280 --> 42:28.624
Geordi, Data, reconfigure
the computer and the records.

42:28.800 --> 42:30.984
Number One, I want you to oversee
the rest of the ship.

42:31.160 --> 42:32.780
And this time,

42:33.200 --> 42:34.659
let's get it right.

42:42.040 --> 42:44.108
[COMPUTER BEEPING]

42:47.960 --> 42:49.133
What happened, Data?

42:49.320 --> 42:51.917
The effect from the wormhole
was rather intense, sir.

42:52.080 --> 42:53.217
So it would seem.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.870
<i>DATA: Everyone but myself
was rendered unconscious.</i>

42:56.040 --> 42:58.269
My positronic system
is immune to the effect.

42:58.440 --> 43:00.267
How long were we out?

43:00.440 --> 43:02.784
- Thirty seconds, sir.
<i>RIKER: Current position?</i>

43:02.960 --> 43:05.638
Point-five-four parsecs
from our previous position.

43:05.800 --> 43:08.512
Bearing 285 mark 147.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.301
- It could be worse.
- Yes, sir.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.911
The wormhole appears
to have been a local phenomenon.

43:14.080 --> 43:16.183
<i>CRUSHER: Crusher to Bridge.
What happened, captain?</i>

43:16.400 --> 43:19.112
The <i>Enterprise</i>
went through a Wormhole, doctor.

43:19.320 --> 43:21.102
It seems the entire crew
was unconscious

43:21.320 --> 43:23.228
for approximately 30 seconds.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.710
<i>Is anyone on the Bridge hurt?</i>

43:25.920 --> 43:26.977
Apparently not.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.993
<i>I'll start checking the other decks.
Crusher out.</i>

43:30.160 --> 43:31.297
Status reports?

43:31.480 --> 43:33.548
Shields and weapons systems,
unaffected.

43:33.720 --> 43:36.317
- No damage in Engineering.
- Counselor?

43:36.440 --> 43:39.015
<i>[IN NORMAL VOICE] There's a
general feeling of disorientation onboard</i>

43:39.045 --> 43:40.990
but nothing serious
as far as I can tell.

43:41.760 --> 43:43.380
Very well.

43:43.560 --> 43:45.705
There's still that anomalous
Class-M planet

43:45.720 --> 43:47.385
we were going to investigate.

43:47.740 --> 43:50.340
- Re-plot a course to take us back to...
- Sir.

43:50.720 --> 43:52.145
It is likely the anomalous readings

43:52.320 --> 43:54.549
were the result
of the wormhole's effect.

43:54.720 --> 43:56.502
It was extremely unstable.

43:56.680 --> 43:58.541
I would recommend
against returning.

43:58.720 --> 44:01.754
It might put the <i>Enterprise</i>
at further risk.

44:02.080 --> 44:05.240
- We could launch a probe.
- That would certainly be sufficient, sir.

44:13.080 --> 44:14.137
Make it so.

44:14.320 --> 44:16.102
And put out a hazard advisory
to Starfleet.

44:16.280 --> 44:20.605
- Ensign, set a course to Evadne IV.
- Aye, sir.

44:21.500 --> 44:23.210
Engage.
