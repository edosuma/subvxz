WEBVTT

00:28.240 --> 00:32.120
A soccer life doesn't last a lifetime.
There's a limit.

00:32.480 --> 00:35.600
I hope I can play beyond the age of 35.

00:35.960 --> 00:40.640
So I try to enjoy my time,
but when I'm older

00:41.000 --> 00:46.200
I also want to be able to look in
the mirror and know I did all I could.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.320
I couldn't live with myself
knowing I could have tried harder.

00:59.520 --> 01:03.800
You can't say the red carpet has
been rolled out for me from the start,

01:04.160 --> 01:07.280
because I've had to fight
for everything I have.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.720
When I was 16 years old
I lost my father.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.640
It was among
the hardest times of my life.

01:30.280 --> 01:33.800
I had to try and solve
many problems all by myself.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.960
Around that time

01:37.320 --> 01:41.040
I was told my contract
wouldn't be renewed after the season.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.480
My mother picked me up after practice.

01:44.040 --> 01:46.520
Maybe I was crying,
but I didn't want to her to know.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.680
That was a moment
where you have to make a choice.

01:50.040 --> 01:52.360
You either say, "Okay, it's over."

01:52.720 --> 01:57.280
Or you believe in yourself, no matter
what, and show them how good you are.

02:01.360 --> 02:05.480
We have a very exciting show for you
with The Best FIFA Men's Player.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.280
Even during such a strange year,
even without fans,

02:08.640 --> 02:11.080
we've seen so much brilliant football,

02:11.440 --> 02:14.600
and it's given us
this outstanding shortlist for 2020.

02:16.480 --> 02:19.720
When you've worked so hard for so long,

02:20.080 --> 02:23.040
trained so hard to
improve your performance,

02:23.400 --> 02:28.200
to be part of the era of Messi and
Ronaldo, that is something very special.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.640
The dream comes true!

02:31.320 --> 02:33.760
And to announce the winner
we have the FIFA President

02:34.120 --> 02:38.640
on the line! - I would say, rather
than announcing who the winner is,

02:39.000 --> 02:40.680
why not make him a surprise?

02:44.200 --> 02:47.000
And the winner is Robert Lewandowski!

03:53.440 --> 03:55.480
Too tight?
- No. It's great.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.960
Have a look for yourself
and adjust your collar.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.520
Thanks, Coach!

04:08.080 --> 04:12.280
Tonight we will also pay homage
to the FIFA FIFPRO Men's World 11.

04:14.440 --> 04:15.720
Alphonso Davies.

04:16.280 --> 04:18.680
In midfield Joshua Kimmich.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.360
Robert Lewandowski.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.000
The Best FIFA Men's Keeper,
Manuel Neuer.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.880
The Best FIFA Men's Coach is …

04:28.800 --> 04:30.120
Jürgen Klopp!

04:32.080 --> 04:33.080
Jürgen Klopp?

04:33.520 --> 04:36.680
Jürgen, your face says it all!
You're shocked!

04:37.320 --> 04:41.600
Yes, like probably many others, I was
very surprised to hear my name tonight.

04:42.560 --> 04:47.800
I really thought Hansi Flick would win,
after Bayern's unbelievable season.

04:50.520 --> 04:51.960
Congrats, you deserve it.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.760
Congratulations.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.160
Congratulations, you deserve it.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.520
Congratulations, happy birthday!

05:02.880 --> 05:06.960
Thank you. My birthday is in August,
but thanks anyway.

05:09.360 --> 05:12.000
Did you watch it on TV
or over the Internet?

05:12.680 --> 05:13.600
Internet.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.440
They didn't show it on TV.
- Well, they took their time.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.720
It dragged on a bit.

05:20.080 --> 05:22.920
But I didn't know until the very end.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.600
Or that the president was going
to be there. Right, Mom,

05:27.040 --> 05:31.400
I'm hanging up now.
- Yes. I love you. Get a good rest.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.800
I'll phone again soon. Big kiss. Bye.
- And a big kiss from me. Bye.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.600
But poor Hansi …
We won all the titles.

05:38.960 --> 05:42.120
We only lost three games
over the entire season!

05:42.480 --> 05:45.040
He's a great coach and a great guy.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.120
I'm coming home!

06:00.080 --> 06:01.920
What my parents did for me

06:02.280 --> 06:05.400
is incredible.
When they came home from work

06:05.760 --> 06:08.680
LESZNO, POLAND
they took me to practice,

06:09.040 --> 06:11.840
which was an hours' drive
there and back.

06:19.080 --> 06:22.600
Many other parents asked them,
"Why do you do it?"

06:24.200 --> 06:26.320
They didn't do all that

06:26.680 --> 06:29.200
so that I could become
a professional soccer player,

06:29.560 --> 06:32.360
they just wanted me to be happy
with what I was doing.

06:35.080 --> 06:38.520
My father was a gym teacher
and he helped me with everything.

06:38.880 --> 06:43.080
At school we never played soccer,
which made me angry.

06:43.440 --> 06:47.880
I asked my father, why not. He said
it's good to learn other sports too.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.880
He taught me Judo too.

06:50.320 --> 06:54.760
He was big and strong, but I threw him
on the floor when I was quite young.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.640
That was the first time

06:58.000 --> 07:01.800
he told me I was versatile enough
to start playing soccer.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.320
Lewandowski!

07:05.920 --> 07:06.880
The Master!

07:08.120 --> 07:10.280
Bayern's history maker.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.080
The absolute goal machine!

07:14.240 --> 07:17.840
He lives to score goals.
He is made to score goals.

07:18.320 --> 07:21.040
He is having the time of his life!

07:21.800 --> 07:24.560
Five goals within nine minutes.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.040
Robert Lewandowski …

07:32.040 --> 07:35.360
My father watches me from above
when I go out on the field.

07:37.720 --> 07:40.720
He still supports me, I'm certain of it.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.960
MARCH 14, 2021
CLUB GROUNDS SÄBENER STRASSE

07:53.720 --> 07:55.640
Short and snappy today?

07:56.560 --> 07:58.760
Because of the weather.
- What do mean?

07:59.120 --> 08:01.080
Somewhat chilly, isn't it?

08:01.840 --> 08:03.680
Put on some warm clothes!

08:06.040 --> 08:08.680
I just said what everyone was thinking.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.240
You too?
- No, it's fine.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.560
A second ago
you were all bitching about it.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.880
Niki went to the limit in the course.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.960
Everyone below me on the list
should be sold!

08:31.320 --> 08:33.200
Where's Gnabry on this?

08:35.280 --> 08:37.760
Yeah, I wasn't able to sprint.

08:38.440 --> 08:41.520
Choupo is faster than me.
- Phonzy, dude, damn you.

08:44.040 --> 08:47.720
NYON, SWITZERLAND - MARCH 19, 2021
UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE DRAW

08:50.800 --> 08:53.800
Welcome, Ladies and Gentlemen, to the
house of European football in Nyon

08:54.160 --> 08:58.120
for the draw for the UEFA Champions
League quarterfinals and semifinals.

08:58.480 --> 09:03.920
I welcome Sporting Director
Hasan Salihamidžić. - Thank you.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.320
Man, I've been through

09:07.960 --> 09:09.520
so many things.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.440
I take it as it comes.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.160
FC Bayern Munich.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.320
Paris Saint-Germain.

09:17.680 --> 09:22.160
We get Paris Saint-Germain.
That's last year's final.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.720
Is it Paris?

09:26.480 --> 09:28.320
PSG.
- PSG.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.280
I know you're not excited.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.000
Back to Paris!

09:33.840 --> 09:36.040
I'm going back to P…

09:37.400 --> 09:40.640
Hey, Brazzo!
- St. Germain Paris. - So, happy?

09:41.080 --> 09:44.160
Paris is a good opponent.
Many viewers worldwide.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.640
We can show what we're worth.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.080
Good promotion for you. - Sure.
- But Dortmund in the semifinal …

09:50.520 --> 09:55.360
At least there'll be a German coach
in the semifinal, Pep or Terzić!

09:55.720 --> 09:59.680
It snowed all day yesterday,
but in two weeks it'll all be gone.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.520
But for now it's still snowing.
Your Brazilian friends will be cold!

10:04.280 --> 10:06.440
Sure, it's still snowing now!

10:06.800 --> 10:10.240
Say hi from me!
- Müller says hi and good luck.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.520
Exactly! A "bonjour".
- Tell him good luck back.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.480
He sends his regards.
- Thanks!

10:15.920 --> 10:18.800
Two cross from you.
- We'll see. Choupo!

10:20.680 --> 10:22.400
Hello.
- Hello.

10:22.760 --> 10:24.960
The guys will be pretty motivated,

10:25.400 --> 10:29.000
but so are we. I'm looking forward
to the match and to meeting them again.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.800
It's a crucial time for us.
The upcoming Champions League. Leipzig,

10:33.160 --> 10:35.400
a decisive game in the German League.

10:37.160 --> 10:39.360
"Do or die," as I always say.

10:40.560 --> 10:41.720
This is it.

10:42.080 --> 10:47.200
MARCH 22, 2021
INTERNATIONAL MATCH BREAK

10:48.480 --> 10:51.640
Thomas, just put on the harness
like you normally do.

10:54.960 --> 10:58.360
Go! Move forward.
Swing your arms, your arms …

10:59.920 --> 11:02.120
PROF. DR. HOLGER BROICH
HEAD OF SCIENCE & FITNESS

11:02.480 --> 11:06.560
Our practice schedule is so full
that I can't do any long-term work.

11:06.920 --> 11:10.040
So I use this period
in between internationals

11:10.400 --> 11:15.480
to have them focus on their strengths
and weaknesses. Last season was tough.

11:15.840 --> 11:20.360
We had only 10 or 12 days off after the
Champions League. No time to process.

11:21.040 --> 11:24.080
That's why it's so phenomenal
what the squad has achieved.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.680
Hermann, I'll do that. Cut it out!

11:27.480 --> 11:29.480
He wants to clear this mess away.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.400
Thanks, Hermann!

11:31.760 --> 11:36.600
It's hardest on the national players,
they have to get straight back to work.

11:36.960 --> 11:39.720
It's always the same problem.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.720
Joachim Löw will end

11:45.080 --> 11:48.760
his career as national coach after
the European Championship this summer.

11:49.120 --> 11:52.960
That will give us plenty of time
to find the best solution

11:53.320 --> 11:54.880
for the time thereafter.

11:55.240 --> 11:59.840
Hansi Flick could be a candidate.
And Hansi Flick has often gotten out

12:00.200 --> 12:02.120
of running contracts.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.120
Flick knows the whole team.

12:04.480 --> 12:08.720
He'd be a marvelous solution.
The best thing of all is …

12:09.080 --> 12:13.720
I bet, we'll be able to speculate
about this repeatedly and intensively.

12:20.320 --> 12:22.640
I think they'll keep running with this.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.560
It's the best that could've happened
to them. Well, that's the way it is.

12:30.440 --> 12:34.840
Robert Lewandowski was tackled so hard
in the game against Andorra

12:35.200 --> 12:37.720
that we suspect he's got
an inner ligament injury.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.760
So today we'll check and see
for how long he'll have to be sidelined.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.160
I'll hold the knee like this,

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
and test it in this position

12:51.520 --> 12:53.800
to check its stability.

12:54.160 --> 12:55.120
That's okay.

12:56.280 --> 13:00.120
We've had these X-rays interpreted
by several other people too,

13:00.480 --> 13:03.960
and they all agree
that it's a hairline crack.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.280
So the knee needs to rest.

13:06.640 --> 13:09.960
We discussed this yesterday

13:10.320 --> 13:13.840
and decided that you
will need three to four weeks

13:14.200 --> 13:18.360
before you can start playing again.
- Three to four weeks?

13:23.960 --> 13:26.640
So definitely at least three weeks?

13:34.120 --> 13:36.080
What's today's date?

13:36.600 --> 13:41.520
Two Champions League matches,
three National League matches … Yeah?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.280
But we shouldn't just

13:45.640 --> 13:50.360
close our eyes and hope for the best,
because it's a big risk for you.

13:50.720 --> 13:55.720
And in the long run it could backfire.
The knee has to be healthy and stable.

13:57.840 --> 14:01.240
We want an initial period of rest
and then you can start some training.

14:01.600 --> 14:06.760
Carrying on like this would be risky
for the cruciate ligament and the knee.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.840
So that means, from here …

14:11.000 --> 14:12.920
one, two …

14:13.280 --> 14:16.120
That's basically the whole … of April.

14:18.440 --> 14:19.400
Lewi …

14:20.000 --> 14:21.840
C'est la vie, yeah?

14:32.960 --> 14:34.600
Let's set everything up,

14:35.800 --> 14:37.640
and then we'll have a look

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
at Leipzig.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.160
Now that we're up against Leipzig

14:43.520 --> 14:47.080
it's a real shame that Lewi's sidelined.

14:48.080 --> 14:52.640
It'll be a variable game.
We'll need some new solutions to win it.

14:53.720 --> 14:58.400
We know it won't be easy, so we'll have
to work even more closely as a team.

15:00.920 --> 15:02.560
A full house today.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.400
If they attack early on,

15:05.760 --> 15:09.000
in a 4-2-3-1 they'll pass the ball
to the side. But against us

15:09.360 --> 15:12.400
they'll know
their players won't be good enough.

15:13.520 --> 15:16.200
And they're worn out
from their national-team matches.

15:16.560 --> 15:19.880
We have to instruct our guys
what to do with the ball,

15:20.240 --> 15:22.760
where to position themselves,
and to recognize

15:23.120 --> 15:25.000
the situations where Leipzig

15:25.360 --> 15:29.200
always allow scoring chances,
and when their positional play is off.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.440
Of course it's bitter

15:33.880 --> 15:37.640
when our top striker
of 35 goals in 28 games is sidelined.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
It'd be bitter for any team.

15:40.680 --> 15:43.880
But we still want
and need to play our own game.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.560
Let's hope Choupo
can fill the void left by Lewi.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.960
Hello, everyone.
April's starting out with a top match.

16:05.320 --> 16:08.160
FC Bayern's visiting RB Leipzig.
#1 versus #2.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.480
Now please fasten your seatbelts.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.840
This is the final sprint
to the finish of the National League

16:15.200 --> 16:18.160
and the Champions League,
and every player knows

16:18.520 --> 16:22.160
that in these few weeks
many things will be decided.

16:22.600 --> 16:26.200
Being there at the right moment
is one of our players' qualities.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.360
Knowing what's at stake.

16:28.720 --> 16:31.560
Have a great and successful game.
- Thanks.

16:31.920 --> 16:36.920
RB LEIPZIG VS. FC BAYERN - APRIL 3, 2021
Go out there and find the spirit!

16:37.280 --> 16:40.880
Niceties can wait till after the game.
Go for it, 90 or 95 minutes.

16:41.240 --> 16:45.720
This is all about winning the League.
Nothing else matters. Good luck!

16:53.160 --> 16:56.560
In an empty stadium you can hear
what's happening on the field.

16:57.080 --> 17:00.880
I think you can hear when Bayern Munich
is on the ball and when not.

17:01.240 --> 17:05.720
I expect a team to support each other
and to coach each other.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.840
Welcome to this top match:

17:10.200 --> 17:14.200
RB Leipzig, number 2 in the League,
against Bayern Munich, number 1.

17:15.760 --> 17:17.000
Come on, Choupo!

17:18.080 --> 17:19.640
Well done, Choupo!

17:27.720 --> 17:28.720
Come on, man!

17:44.120 --> 17:46.440
Damn it, losing the ball so easily!

17:47.000 --> 17:49.760
Thomas, be more confident!

17:57.640 --> 17:59.680
A great tackle by Thomas Müller.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.280
Come on, Thomas!
- Go on!

18:02.480 --> 18:05.680
Power play by the
German record champions.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.800
Thomas Müller enters the box.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.600
Goal!

18:25.960 --> 18:27.960
1-0 for Bayern!

18:28.880 --> 18:30.240
Great countermovement.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.760
The back space is occupied.

18:33.120 --> 18:34.600
A perfect goal.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.520
You know, Choupo's doing a great job,
even when he's not on the ball.

18:44.360 --> 18:48.560
It's like there are three of us
on position 10, so we keep having to …

18:49.320 --> 18:51.480
This guy is going,
and you stay behind him.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.240
Just block him, okay?

18:53.600 --> 18:54.920
Come on, guys!

18:55.280 --> 18:58.080
Bayern are in the lead after 45 minutes.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.200
What's he whistling for?
This isn't chess!

19:08.600 --> 19:10.760
A three-man wall.
- Let's go for it.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.600
One more corner.

19:13.960 --> 19:17.280
Five and a half minutes
left on the clock, plus extra-time.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.560
The final minutes …

19:26.320 --> 19:27.640
Another corner …

19:29.880 --> 19:31.560
What's the referee doing?

19:32.800 --> 19:35.240
FC Bayern wins this top match

19:36.280 --> 19:38.480
on day 27 of the German League

19:38.840 --> 19:41.680
1-0 against RB Leipzig.

19:42.560 --> 19:45.360
All national players get two days off.

19:45.720 --> 19:48.040
The others practice tomorrow. Choupo,

19:48.400 --> 19:51.680
you need some rest.
- Choupo, man, you gave everything.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.280
But stay in Munich, okay?

20:01.320 --> 20:03.400
If you've been
in this business as long as I have,

20:03.760 --> 20:07.200
you know things,
you sense and even smell things.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.320
But as a journalist I have to do my job.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.520
So Lothar, you want to give it a try?

20:13.880 --> 20:17.760
Hansi, as you will have overheard,
I'm supposed to ask you again

20:18.120 --> 20:21.960
what your plans are
once the season is over.

20:22.320 --> 20:26.120
Once the season is over
I'll be going on holiday.

20:26.480 --> 20:30.920
And I've said all there is to say about
what happens then. You know me, Lothar,

20:31.280 --> 20:36.720
and I don't know why you let yourself
be coaxed to ask again, but okay.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.080
The Bayern fans want to know
if they can count on you next year.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.880
They hope you'll stay. - I get that,
but I said all there is to say.

20:47.840 --> 20:51.360
It's always the same!
- They're just doing their job.

20:58.040 --> 21:00.600
I remember at first, 2006, 2008, 2010,

21:00.960 --> 21:03.840
he never wanted
to attend press conferences.

21:04.200 --> 21:07.920
He preferred to be
the silent worker in the background.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.680
Media work was a burden to him.

21:11.040 --> 21:14.520
Maybe he is secretly pondering
where to go from here.

21:16.800 --> 21:20.440
TEGERNSEE (LAKE)

21:25.880 --> 21:27.920
ULI HOENESS
HONORARY PRESIDENT

21:28.280 --> 21:32.320
I think
people carry FC Bayern in their heart.

21:33.240 --> 21:35.560
Even though I'm no longer involved

21:35.920 --> 21:38.320
in the business operations,

21:38.680 --> 21:43.440
I catch myself talking about FC Bayern
in every other conversation anyway.

21:49.960 --> 21:53.040
When I joined Bayern in the seventies,

21:53.840 --> 21:56.400
the locker room was a wood cabin.

21:57.200 --> 21:59.280
Grandpa Remm was already past 70.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.520
He did the laundry
and polished our shoes.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.480
That was it.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.680
Sometimes I took my boots home with me

22:08.040 --> 22:11.200
to give them a special polish myself.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.840
These were the things that shaped us.

22:18.520 --> 22:21.720
When I was young
I wore shin guards during training

22:22.080 --> 22:24.200
but not during league matches.

22:24.560 --> 22:27.360
When it was Old versus Young,
you'd best not outrun

22:27.720 --> 22:30.640
"Bulle" Roth twice, because
he'd throw you on the cinder court!

22:31.000 --> 22:33.240
FRANZ "BULLE" ROTH
PLAYER 1966-1978

22:33.600 --> 22:36.400
Uli Hoeneß and Paul Breitner

22:36.760 --> 22:40.080
came to Bayern from the National
Youth Team, oozing self-confidence,

22:40.520 --> 22:43.720
saying, "We're going to
shake things up at Bayern Munich!"

22:44.160 --> 22:46.920
But we didn't take it lying down.

22:48.360 --> 22:52.280
Even back then it was clear that Uli
was a doer. He usually got his way,

22:52.640 --> 22:54.400
and he wanted to make a difference.

23:03.160 --> 23:05.080
Breitner sees Hoeneß.

23:05.440 --> 23:09.640
He outruns his markers and hits the ball
right through the goalkeeper's legs.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.320
The highest trophy

23:12.680 --> 23:15.440
is now in the possession
of FC Bayern from Munich.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.920
FC Bayern Munich wins the European Cup

23:20.360 --> 23:22.920
for the third time in a row!

23:23.280 --> 23:25.000
Madness!

23:25.800 --> 23:27.560
Winning the World Championship

23:27.920 --> 23:32.640
in 1974 created a soccer boom here
in Germany, and suddenly soccer became

23:33.000 --> 23:35.240
politically
and economically interesting.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.880
Uli Hoeneß always had
a keen eye for business,

23:39.320 --> 23:42.280
and he recognized
soccer's economic potential.

23:48.840 --> 23:54.160
Uli Hoeneß knew his market value and
he knew exactly how to profit from it.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.720
He did autograph sessions for money,
wrote sports books.

23:58.080 --> 24:00.000
He knew many clever ways

24:00.440 --> 24:02.800
to increase his earnings.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.160
Shortly before the World Championship

24:05.520 --> 24:07.880
in 1974 I got an offer
from a small publisher

24:08.320 --> 24:11.200
who wanted to publish
a World Championship book.

24:11.640 --> 24:14.840
The copies were numbered
and personally signed

24:15.200 --> 24:18.600
by Paul Breitner and myself.

24:19.560 --> 24:20.920
I remember

24:21.360 --> 24:26.040
our first training camp at Hotel
Bachmair on the banks of Tegernsee.

24:26.400 --> 24:30.320
We were lying in our beds watching TV,

24:30.680 --> 24:34.160
and he had this big wooden box
in front of him,

24:34.520 --> 24:37.760
containing 1,000 sheets of paper
that he was signing.

24:38.120 --> 24:41.600
I said, "What a bummer, so much work!"
But he said, "Never mind,

24:41.960 --> 24:44.280
it's one Deutsche Mark per autograph."

24:44.720 --> 24:49.240
I signed the 100,000 sheets of paper,
and then the World Championship began.

24:49.600 --> 24:52.960
We became world champions!
Nobody had expected us to win.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.760
Suddenly the demand for this book
was so enormous

24:57.200 --> 25:02.360
that the publisher decided to print
another 200,000 copies!

25:02.920 --> 25:05.240
I earned more from this book
than from soccer.

25:07.320 --> 25:09.760
After the 1974 World Championship

25:10.120 --> 25:13.200
advertising on jerseys and boards
was approved in German soccer.

25:13.640 --> 25:17.360
FC Bayern chose Adidas
as their first jersey sponsor.

25:17.720 --> 25:21.760
But to increase the club's revenue,
Uli Hoeneß landed Bayern's first sponsor

25:22.280 --> 25:24.480
outside the sports world.

25:24.840 --> 25:29.800
Now it said "Magirus Deutz" on their
shirts. Hoeneß had negotiated that deal.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.160
It's said the deal was closed in a bar,

25:32.520 --> 25:37.240
on a beer coaster. It got Bayern their
first sponsor outside the sports world.

25:37.680 --> 25:41.840
It shows you how much
he looked towards the future

25:42.200 --> 25:45.120
at a time
when he was still an active player.

25:48.200 --> 25:53.280
Uli Hoeneß was really the first and only
player-manager who's ever been around,

25:53.640 --> 25:56.440
as compared to
the player-coaches of other teams.

25:58.480 --> 26:02.160
MAY 28, 1975 - EUROPEAN CUP
LEEDS UNITED VS. FC BAYERN

26:03.040 --> 26:05.520
Uli Hoeneß seems to be hurt.

26:05.880 --> 26:08.400
His right knee is being treated.

26:19.040 --> 26:24.200
And Uli Hoeneß is down,
grabbing his knee again.

26:25.280 --> 26:28.120
When I was 27 years old,

26:28.480 --> 26:34.040
President Neudecker asked me if I could
imagine becoming manager at FC Bayern.

26:34.400 --> 26:39.880
I said I'd let him know the next day,
and talked to some doctors all night.

26:40.240 --> 26:45.120
They knew my knee, and they all told me
it wouldn't hold out much longer.

26:47.800 --> 26:51.760
I'd prepared myself for this for years.
At the time Robert Schwan

26:52.120 --> 26:55.080
was Bayern's manager,
and I'd been looking over his shoulder.

26:55.440 --> 27:00.640
I knew that I didn't want
to become coach one day, but manager.

27:01.000 --> 27:06.640
And that's how Uli Hoeneß the player
became Uli Hoeneß the manager.

27:10.360 --> 27:14.800
His time as a professional player
gave him a certain feel for the job.

27:15.160 --> 27:19.000
He knew what a squad needed
and what it could maybe do without.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.160
When he took over

27:21.520 --> 27:25.720
he expanded the medical team
with Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt.

27:26.080 --> 27:30.360
Based on his own injury experience
he engaged a rehab coach,

27:30.720 --> 27:35.720
and he reduced the number of friendlies,
which had put a strain on the players.

27:37.480 --> 27:40.560
When I joined FC Bayern we had a masseur

27:40.920 --> 27:45.320
who massaged us with soap,
and that was the entire medical team.

27:48.440 --> 27:52.760
It's an anti-gravity treadmill.
We reduce his body weight to 70 percent

27:53.200 --> 27:55.960
to take the load off his injured foot,

27:56.320 --> 27:58.600
so he can run without hindrance.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.800
I've never been to the Moon, but …

28:03.040 --> 28:04.600
Since Hoeneß's early days

28:05.200 --> 28:09.240
FC Bayern's medical department
has changed radically.

28:09.600 --> 28:13.520
Nowadays parts of it
look like NASA's control center.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.560
The squad won't do much today.
Two days after the game,

28:20.000 --> 28:23.280
one day before the game.
Yesterday's training was a good boost.

28:23.640 --> 28:26.880
We call it a "digital twin".
The more information we have,

28:27.240 --> 28:30.600
the more we can respond to the needs
of the individual player.

28:30.960 --> 28:35.080
We need the data to analyze the training
and to regulate it for a few days.

28:35.440 --> 28:40.000
Then there's also a scientific team
of nearly 40 people,

28:40.360 --> 28:45.560
consisting of performance physiologists,
but also physicists and mathematicians.

28:45.920 --> 28:48.480
But we don't want
the players to get the feeling

28:48.840 --> 28:53.560
they're in an experimental laboratory
or being treated as guinea pigs.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.520
And extend, extend …

28:59.640 --> 29:00.800
Feel it here.

29:01.360 --> 29:04.000
You're doing too much here.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.880
Lewi started training again yesterday.

29:07.240 --> 29:10.480
This week we'll do a lot of
strength training to stabilize his knee.

29:10.840 --> 29:14.680
Then we'll have to see, day by day,
and take small steps.

29:15.040 --> 29:19.680
We want him to rejoin the squad
as quickly as possible, in good health.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.560
He has all the right preconditions.

29:25.920 --> 29:28.800
He's gained lots of muscle mass
in a very short time.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.040
He's set himself a clear goal.

29:31.400 --> 29:34.560
He knows he'll be back in the game
in two or three weeks.

29:36.480 --> 29:40.360
I hope I can still play a few
Champions League matches this season.

29:40.720 --> 29:44.320
But to miss
the quarter final against PSG …

29:44.680 --> 29:48.600
It's much tougher to be injured now
than at the beginning of the season,

29:48.960 --> 29:52.880
with the big matches still ahead of you.
- And plenty of time to come back.

29:53.240 --> 29:57.840
Now you keep thinking about the European
Championship and the Champions League.

29:58.200 --> 29:59.600
The pressure's rising.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.360
This is my second day
and I've already had enough.

30:07.160 --> 30:08.920
We just have to wear the right things.

30:09.280 --> 30:12.400
Shoes, socks …
- Got any rings, jewelry, piercings?

30:15.400 --> 30:19.040
No, that's okay. Say ah! No piercings.
- No.

30:19.400 --> 30:23.840
ACCESS ONLY WITH TRAINED PERSONNEL
OR WITH HOLGER BROICH

30:28.080 --> 30:29.280
Two minutes, 20 seconds.

30:30.280 --> 30:32.760
A hunter goes into a hunting store

30:33.120 --> 30:36.000
to buy binoculars. He asks the salesman,

30:36.360 --> 30:40.040
"Which are your best binoculars?"
The man hands him a great pair

30:40.400 --> 30:44.680
and says, "Try it out. Best go outside
and look down from the balcony."

30:45.640 --> 30:51.200
So he starts looking around and he spots
a man and a woman far away who are …

30:51.560 --> 30:55.920
doing the dirty. And he says, "The house
over there, isn't that yours?"

30:56.280 --> 31:00.760
So the salesman says, "Oh, right."
Damn! I forgot the punchline.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.120
A minute and a half!

31:04.480 --> 31:06.840
Sissies. I've been in there many times.

31:07.200 --> 31:10.560
If you go for it …
It's not cozy, but …

31:11.560 --> 31:12.600
15 seconds!

31:12.960 --> 31:14.680
Right, come out!

31:19.280 --> 31:20.320
That's no fun.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.800
I'd like to welcome

31:30.160 --> 31:34.160
CEO Oliver Kahn to the studio.
It's nice to have you here

31:34.520 --> 31:36.280
at the FC Bayern Fan Workshop.

31:36.640 --> 31:39.840
Things have changed.
The club has grown in the last years,

31:40.200 --> 31:42.640
OLIVER KAHN - CEO
and all the European top clubs

31:43.000 --> 31:45.120
develop themselves more and more.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.760
And to prepare the club

31:48.120 --> 31:51.920
for all the upcoming challenges,
we started the AHEAD process.

31:52.360 --> 31:55.440
Over the last decades
FC Bayern has grown

31:55.800 --> 31:58.200
into a world-wide brand.

31:58.560 --> 32:04.560
And it's been my job to strengthen
the brand's position all over the world.

32:06.080 --> 32:09.480
I love FC Bayern!
- I'm an FC Bayern Club member.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.760
I still remember the moment
I sat in the Allianz Arena.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.320
Without FC Bayern

32:14.760 --> 32:18.000
it'd feel like an important
family member was missing.

32:18.440 --> 32:21.320
We have 4,500 fan clubs,

32:21.680 --> 32:23.640
700 of them outside Germany.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.160
There's no other sport club
with these kinds of numbers.

32:28.520 --> 32:33.560
And that's the reason why we also have
a subsidiary in Shanghai, China,

32:33.920 --> 32:39.600
and one in New York, because we want
to be very close to our fans.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.840
It makes you feel
like you're part of something big.

32:42.280 --> 32:44.600
Last year
I had a video call with Thomas Müller.

32:44.960 --> 32:48.240
This is one of the best things
that could ever happen in my life.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.200
Basically,

32:51.160 --> 32:54.320
this process that we've just started
is about

32:55.120 --> 32:57.560
looking for improvement potential

32:58.000 --> 33:00.280
and opening a dialogue with our fans.

33:00.640 --> 33:04.040
To find out how they perceive the club,

33:04.400 --> 33:07.960
today, but also in the future.

33:08.320 --> 33:12.400
Bundesliga first. We don't want a "World
League" or "European Superleague".

33:12.760 --> 33:16.800
A common opinion was, perhaps,
better promotion of the women's side.

33:17.160 --> 33:21.680
Cosmopolitan yet Bavarian, traveling
the world, but at home in Bavaria.

33:22.120 --> 33:27.080
Of course FC Bayern has to grow
as a business in the future,

33:27.440 --> 33:31.280
but it also has to remain a soccer club.

33:31.960 --> 33:35.760
And that is really the major challenge

33:36.120 --> 33:39.640
that we have to face every year.

33:45.080 --> 33:46.240
Morning.

33:49.920 --> 33:53.240
Some want everything to be
the way it was 40 years ago,

33:53.600 --> 33:58.320
while others long for
an FC Bayern Corporation of the future.

33:58.680 --> 34:02.760
So you have to navigate
between these conflicting priorities.

34:03.360 --> 34:05.560
You have to justify everything you do.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.080
Some say, "We only want
German business partners." Seriously?

34:09.440 --> 34:11.520
You know, that kind of friction.

34:11.880 --> 34:14.800
You have to make sure
it doesn't get ripped apart.

34:15.960 --> 34:19.680
Things will get harder and harder
for traditional clubs.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.960
But I think …

34:23.520 --> 34:26.360
the fans have the best feel
for the club.

34:27.200 --> 34:28.320
They always have.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.560
Without fans
there's no reason for us to play soccer.

34:32.920 --> 34:36.640
Everything we do,
we do just for the fans.

34:37.080 --> 34:41.960
The motivation
for our daily toil and our hard work

34:42.680 --> 34:47.640
is to make them happy, those people
who love the club and feel close to it.

34:53.640 --> 34:59.080
I remember when Uli Hoeneß joined us,
we had a few tough years behind us.

34:59.440 --> 35:04.480
Franz Beckenbauer left us in 1977
to join the New York Cosmos.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.280
With him, FC Bayern
didn't just lose its best player,

35:09.640 --> 35:11.680
but also a bit of its image.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.080
ADVANCE SALE

35:13.440 --> 35:16.480
85 percent of our revenue

35:16.840 --> 35:20.640
came from the spectators,
from the Olympic Stadium.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
At times there were only
10,000 to 14,000 spectators.

35:24.360 --> 35:28.600
The stadiums were almost empty and
male dominated, there was much violence.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.640
Back then Bayern had a turnover

35:32.360 --> 35:36.240
of 12 million German Marks,

35:36.600 --> 35:39.640
and a debt of 7 million German Marks.

35:42.400 --> 35:46.040
I think, to Uli this club, FC Bayern,

35:46.400 --> 35:48.200
is a matter of the heart.

35:48.560 --> 35:51.640
It hurts him physically
if things don't go well.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.560
I think it actually hurts him.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.360
So there's no kind of distance.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.840
And I think that defines him.

36:02.600 --> 36:06.120
The first thing he did was go
to America to check things out,

36:06.480 --> 36:10.400
because he had seen that American clubs
in the NFL and the NBA

36:10.760 --> 36:13.720
were marketed way better
than German soccer clubs.

36:15.760 --> 36:19.360
I swore to myself
to make FC Bayern more independent

36:19.720 --> 36:24.160
from spectator revenues. Not from the
fans, they're vital. From the revenues.

36:24.520 --> 36:30.800
We had to improve our marketing,
merchandising and our TV revenues.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.080
He's a brilliant salesman,

36:36.440 --> 36:39.720
but he's also a soccer expert,
and that combination

36:40.160 --> 36:42.640
was priceless for Bayern at the time.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.160
Uli always tells the story

36:46.520 --> 36:50.880
about how he sold Karl-Heinz Rummenigge
to put the club in the black again.

36:52.480 --> 36:55.680
I was sold for about 11 million

36:56.000 --> 37:00.160
to Inter Milan, which was the
second highest transfer fee at the time.

37:00.520 --> 37:04.560
Whether it was the best deal of all,
I don't know, but it was a vital deal.

37:05.000 --> 37:09.600
Now we were four million in the black
and we bought Lothar Matthäus for two.

37:09.960 --> 37:12.440
Goal by new acquisition Lothar Matthäus.

37:13.280 --> 37:16.640
You could've gotten five Lothars
for the money Karl-Heinz brought in.

37:17.840 --> 37:21.720
We put the remaining millions
in a fixed-term deposit account,

37:22.080 --> 37:25.240
and FC Bayern
has been free of debt ever since.

37:26.400 --> 37:32.040
When Uli started we had 20 employees.
Nowadays it's in the region of 1,000.

37:32.640 --> 37:36.320
Every match is sold out, and
the revenues are on a different scale.

37:36.760 --> 37:38.480
Things have changed a lot.

37:40.320 --> 37:45.120
When my wife and I were in San Francisco
and saw all these men in blue suits

37:45.480 --> 37:48.040
buying fan merchandise for their kids,

37:48.400 --> 37:51.280
I said to my wife,
"If we get people to do that in Bayern,

37:51.640 --> 37:55.160
we've made it." And here we are.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.920
Uli Hoeneß understood very early on

38:01.280 --> 38:03.920
that this game is about entertainment,

38:04.280 --> 38:06.800
and also about telling stories,

38:07.160 --> 38:09.440
about enthralling and exciting people,

38:09.800 --> 38:12.400
giving people something to argue about.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.880
He's one of the

38:16.240 --> 38:19.880
most important people
who made FC Bayern what it is today.

38:20.240 --> 38:23.040
That's my opinion, and that's how it is.

38:25.640 --> 38:28.800
It's the same with the Allianz Arena.
Uli Hoeneß came to me

38:29.160 --> 38:32.640
and said,
"We need money for a new stadium."

38:33.000 --> 38:37.320
He wanted Adidas, where I was CEO,
to buy a share of 10 percent.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.160
Everybody had huge stadiums,

38:40.520 --> 38:42.960
and we had "Grünwalder Straße".
We were tenants

38:43.320 --> 38:46.080
and dependent on certain things.
The first big step for us

38:46.440 --> 38:49.280
was moving into the Olympic Stadium.

38:50.920 --> 38:53.680
The second big step
was moving into the Allianz Arena.

38:54.040 --> 38:57.720
It had been Uli Hoeneß's dream,
but the most important thing was

38:58.080 --> 39:02.640
that we had found a home for our fans.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.320
This stadium has been key

39:05.680 --> 39:11.160
to our success over the past few years.
It has made FC Bayern what it is today.

39:12.760 --> 39:18.120
Everything FC Bayern has here,
has been built by their own hands.

39:23.440 --> 39:28.600
It's outrageous we're being criticized
for busting our asses all these years

39:28.960 --> 39:30.720
and building this stadium!

39:33.920 --> 39:36.240
He has always treated this club

39:36.680 --> 39:39.320
as if it was his property, but it isn't.

39:39.680 --> 39:42.600
He's a member, like so many others.

39:42.960 --> 39:47.800
Right? And he was its manager and
president, but it's not his property.

39:48.160 --> 39:53.440
But he led it as if it was his business,
with all his passion.

39:56.800 --> 40:01.200
They can publish anything they want,
even if there's no truth to it!

40:01.640 --> 40:05.040
This crappy atmosphere
is your doing, not ours!

40:05.400 --> 40:07.080
He vented his feelings,

40:07.720 --> 40:11.320
ranted, polarized,
and sometimes polemicized.

40:11.680 --> 40:14.720
I'd love to have heard
your comments after that!

40:15.080 --> 40:19.960
Depending on his mood,
he starts ranting when he is provoked,

40:20.320 --> 40:24.560
and gives vent to everything he's
had to endure over the past few days.

40:24.920 --> 40:29.560
But that's the way he is,
and people expect it of him nowadays.

40:33.880 --> 40:36.920
Munich Regional Court II
has convicted the accused

40:37.280 --> 40:40.280
in seven isolated cases of tax evasion

40:40.640 --> 40:44.080
to a prison term of
three years and six months.

40:44.440 --> 40:45.480
Nobody's perfect.

40:45.960 --> 40:48.160
I've made many mistakes in my life too.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.440
And if you've made a mistake,

40:50.880 --> 40:55.280
you have to say you're sorry,
and you have to say it out loud.

40:56.040 --> 40:59.120
My lawyers advised me
to appeal the verdict.

40:59.480 --> 41:04.440
I discussed it with the entire family
by the Tegernsee until 3 a.m.,

41:04.800 --> 41:08.600
and the next day I accepted the verdict.

41:08.960 --> 41:12.200
I'm still convinced
it was the right thing to do.

41:14.520 --> 41:17.160
It was the hardest time of my life.

41:18.000 --> 41:22.200
He admitted everything he did
and he answered for it.

41:22.840 --> 41:25.960
He served his prison sentence and …

41:26.480 --> 41:28.880
he suffered badly from it.

41:33.600 --> 41:38.320
NOVEMBER 25, 2016 - ANNUAL CLUB MEETING
I expected them to be angry too,

41:38.680 --> 41:40.280
and disappointed.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.760
When I came back I was really nervous.

41:43.640 --> 41:48.400
I was going to let the atmosphere decide
whether I would run for re-election.

41:48.760 --> 41:53.320
It was one of the hardest moments of
my life, going to that general meeting.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.800
50 or 60 percent of the vote

41:56.160 --> 41:58.600
would've meant
I was chosen out of habit.

41:58.960 --> 42:01.840
I respect each and every one of you

42:02.200 --> 42:06.400
who refuses to vote for me
because of my misconduct.

42:10.640 --> 42:14.920
But I was re-elected with 98 percent
of the vote. I was bowled over.

42:36.200 --> 42:39.760
THANKS ULI
YOU ARE THE BEST MAN

42:40.760 --> 42:43.880
APRIL 6, 2021 - THE DAY BEFORE THE
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUARTERFINAL

42:46.840 --> 42:49.080
Dembélé is way better than Mbappé.

42:49.920 --> 42:52.240
What does "better" mean? Why "better"?

42:54.960 --> 42:58.840
If I could dribble like Dembélé,
I'd be better too.

42:59.200 --> 43:02.640
If I had to choose between Dembélé
and one of you, I'd choose one of you.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.400
Some can do it, and some do it.
That's the whole difference.

43:07.760 --> 43:10.600
You're so right, now leave!
- Thank you.

43:10.960 --> 43:13.360
I can leave. I'll think about it.

43:19.200 --> 43:21.560
This whole Dembélé discussion
pisses me off.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.480
I'm not saying you're wrong.

43:23.920 --> 43:27.520
I'm not saying you're wrong either,
but you don't see my point.

43:27.880 --> 43:31.040
You're always making the same case.
If I send you a scene of his, you say,

43:31.400 --> 43:33.040
"In five games!" Hello!

43:34.120 --> 43:37.080
If he joins us, I'll go
and sit on the bench voluntarily.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.880
With your salary
you won't be sitting anywhere.

43:52.240 --> 43:55.000
Right, men. Quarterfinal. Paris.

43:55.360 --> 43:58.520
So you know
what's expected of us, of you.

43:58.880 --> 44:03.080
Never mind that some players have
been sidelined. That's the way it is.

44:03.680 --> 44:07.360
Di María, Neymar and Mbappé
are all exceptional players.

44:07.800 --> 44:11.080
Players who can turn a match around.

44:11.600 --> 44:15.120
Like in this situation:
He always tends to go inside.

44:15.480 --> 44:18.520
Pin him down by the sideline
so he can't turn.

44:19.480 --> 44:23.320
We need you to move back immediately.

44:23.680 --> 44:26.960
Don't lose a second,
get back on the defense.

44:27.320 --> 44:32.280
Set up the defensive triangle and we're
safe again. We have the ability

44:34.200 --> 44:38.080
to get where we want, the semifinals.
What's most important

44:38.440 --> 44:42.800
is that we act together as a team
and seize our opportunities.

44:43.160 --> 44:46.880
APRIL 7, 2021 - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE
QUARTERFINAL, FIRST LEG

44:47.240 --> 44:51.760
Sometimes these defenders
behave like idiots round Neymar.

44:53.760 --> 44:55.000
No!

44:58.440 --> 45:00.320
He's not calling it.

45:02.240 --> 45:03.640
Mbappé.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.480
Doing it in one go,

45:07.840 --> 45:12.600
that's hard. It's better to stop it,
take it with you, and shoot.

45:12.960 --> 45:16.240
We have to shoot on goal.
He's no good, believe me.

45:22.960 --> 45:27.800
Hi, Hansi. About the news that Jérôme
Boateng's contract won't be renewed …

45:28.160 --> 45:30.640
Does the timing surprise you?

45:31.000 --> 45:34.440
It's a bit unfortunate before the
match against Paris Saint-Germain.

45:34.800 --> 45:38.760
I won't comment on that before the game,
nor after the game probably.

45:39.120 --> 45:42.800
Everyone knows how I feel about Jérôme,
and everyone knows his qualities.

45:43.160 --> 45:46.320
He's played a great season,
so for a coach and his team

45:46.920 --> 45:51.400
it's great to have a player like him,
who is experienced and highly skilled.

45:51.760 --> 45:56.400
But that's all I'm going to say
about it, so there's an end to it.

46:06.360 --> 46:07.600
Ten years …

46:09.160 --> 46:10.920
Not a bad stretch.

46:12.880 --> 46:15.960
Eight league titles,
five German Cup titles,

46:16.320 --> 46:19.680
the Club World Cup twice,
Champions League twice.

46:23.560 --> 46:27.000
Yeah, the timing's a bit unfortunate,
and the way it was handled

46:27.360 --> 46:30.520
could've been better,
but that's how it is.

46:33.280 --> 46:37.600
Right, hold on!
Now I have to put some things right.

46:37.960 --> 46:42.400
Here at Bayern all decisions are made
by the group, not one single person.

46:42.760 --> 46:47.960
What's being spread now, that it was
me who no longer wanted him, is crap.

46:48.320 --> 46:51.480
SPORTING DIRECTOR
I knew he wouldn't be playing that day.

46:51.840 --> 46:54.680
I thought he ought to know the truth,
and I told him.

46:55.120 --> 46:56.880
I've known Jérôme for ages.

46:57.240 --> 47:01.520
I'm glad he was part of the Bayern
family, which he will always remain.

47:01.880 --> 47:06.600
But I know he has two kids, a family,
he needs to make plans, so …

47:07.880 --> 47:11.160
It was important to me
that he learned of it.

47:13.800 --> 47:16.440
Champions League quarterfinal, first leg

47:16.800 --> 47:18.280
in the Allianz Arena,

47:18.640 --> 47:21.160
Bayern Munich
against Paris Saint-Germain.

47:21.720 --> 47:25.440
Up front it's Kylian Mbappé,
Neymar, Ángel Di María …

47:28.360 --> 47:32.200
But, really, the whole team is what
Bayern Munich have to focus on.
