00:02.803 --> 00:06.105
We were known as KWA,
Knitters with Attitude.

I'm a grand--
I'm a grandfather?

<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:18.518 --> 00:20.119

00:20.121 --> 00:21.954
TANDY:<i> You're having sex</i>
<i>with Gail and Melissa.</i>

00:21.956 --> 00:23.455
You dirty dog.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.790
How long were
you and Phil trying

00:24.792 --> 00:26.458
before you got pregnant?

00:26.460 --> 00:28.794
Tandy and I have been
trying for, like,

00:28.796 --> 00:30.829
I don't know,
six months now?

00:30.831 --> 00:32.297
Six months?
That long?

00:32.299 --> 00:33.966
CAROL:
<i>We're not pregnant.</i>

00:33.968 --> 00:35.367
Don't worry, everything's
gonna be all right.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.273
Service.

00:51.151 --> 00:53.652
CAROL:
Hey, Tandy?

00:53.654 --> 00:54.887
What are you doing?

00:54.889 --> 00:56.989
Oh, just honing my game.

00:56.991 --> 00:59.725
Tandy, I need you to do
something for me today.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.160
Okay, what do you got?

01:01.162 --> 01:02.995
I need you to masturbate.

01:02.997 --> 01:04.563
Way ahead of you.
Yeah, check it off the list.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.898
What else you got?

01:05.900 --> 01:08.033
Oh, no, I need you
to do it again.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.535
Again, way ahead of you.

01:09.537 --> 01:12.371
No, th-this is different.
Left-handed?

01:12.373 --> 01:15.574
No, it's just I was reading up
on fertility issues.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.842
Oh.
And I think we should

01:16.844 --> 01:18.077
check your sperm motility.

01:18.079 --> 01:19.745
So I went to the store

01:19.747 --> 01:21.547
and I got a male fertility test.

01:21.549 --> 01:22.548
Why?

01:22.550 --> 01:23.549
Well, you know,

01:23.551 --> 01:24.683
it's been a while

01:24.685 --> 01:26.351
and we're not pregnant yet.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.854
What's the rush?
It'll happen when it happens.

01:28.856 --> 01:30.856
Well, I mean, look at Phil,
okay-- he's dead!

01:30.858 --> 01:32.858
One day you're here,
the next you're not.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.860
And I want to get your goods
before you croak.

01:34.862 --> 01:37.196
Yeah, you're right...
Having a family's important.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.598
Yeah, let's do this.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.201
Okay, great.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.369
I know it's kind of
a weird request.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.605
Do you think you could
handle the pressure?

01:46.607 --> 01:50.109
Care Bear, I've been practicing
for this test my whole life.

01:50.111 --> 01:52.211
I won't let you down.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.846
Okay.

01:59.219 --> 02:01.587
Oh!

02:01.589 --> 02:04.723
Ah, well, at least
this isn't a Monet.

02:04.725 --> 02:05.991
Oh, this is a Monet.

02:12.065 --> 02:15.267
Okay, well, thanks
for the lotion, Gail.

02:15.269 --> 02:18.237
Boy, were my forearms dry!

02:18.239 --> 02:21.473
Damn it!

02:21.475 --> 02:23.075
Damn it.
(crying)

02:23.077 --> 02:25.077
Hey, Todd.
Oh.

02:25.079 --> 02:26.745
Hey, I-I was just thanking Gail

02:26.747 --> 02:29.281
for some lotion she gave me

02:29.283 --> 02:30.949
for my forearms, yeah.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.251
You probably heard me
talking about it

02:32.253 --> 02:33.485
as I was leaving her room.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.621
Real dry, my forearms.

02:35.623 --> 02:37.623
Yeah, got a good coat
on them now, though.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.258
Yeah, lotion.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.926
What a godsend.

02:40.928 --> 02:44.096
Uh, do you want to come
watch a movie with me?

02:44.098 --> 02:46.298
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I-I'll be there in a minute.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.966
I'll just give you
a little preview first.

02:47.968 --> 02:49.001
Okay, yeah.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.502
Great, yeah.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.271
Nice trailer there.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.006
Looking forward

02:54.008 --> 02:55.607
to the feature-length
version of that.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.609
You know, uh, sex.

02:57.611 --> 03:00.179
Bring this weirdness
to the bedroom.

03:00.181 --> 03:02.981
Right.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.017
CAROL:
<i>Oh, what are you doing?</i>

03:05.019 --> 03:07.286
Well, I'm just, uh,
cramming for the test.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.988
You know how I feel
about pornography.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.157
Carol, I'm not gonna go
into this situation unarmed.

03:12.159 --> 03:13.659
I mean, it's too important.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.027
Well, you will be armed.

03:16.162 --> 03:17.462
I made you

03:17.464 --> 03:19.131
a very special collection

03:19.133 --> 03:22.501
of highly erotic
images of women.

03:22.503 --> 03:25.137
But unlike the
misogynistic,

03:25.139 --> 03:27.172
male-centric trash you read,

03:27.174 --> 03:30.475
these women are sexy because
they're highly intelligent,

03:30.477 --> 03:34.346
accomplished, and-- as far
as we know-- unmolested.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.514
Huh.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.815
I call it female en-porn-ment.

03:36.817 --> 03:37.816
Okay.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.318
Well, I'm listening.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.552
Uh, let me take a gander.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.221
Yeah, sure.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.156
(groans)

03:44.158 --> 03:45.657
(clears throat)

03:45.659 --> 03:47.326
Okay.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.994
Ooh-la-la!

03:48.996 --> 03:53.665
I'm a sexy CEO who did
not sleep my way to the top.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.001
Got there by studying hard
and maintaining my focus.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.737
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

03:58.739 --> 04:02.040
And check out this
sexy lady judge.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.909
That long black robe

04:03.911 --> 04:06.345
covers every inch
of her body.

04:06.347 --> 04:09.548
Except for the biggest
sexual organ she has--

04:09.550 --> 04:11.350
her brain.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.352
(sexy growl)

04:13.354 --> 04:15.187
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:15.189 --> 04:16.855
And look at this stunner.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.524
The President
of the United States herself.

04:19.526 --> 04:22.694
And behind her is
her First Lady Désirée.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.763
(whispers):
They're lesbians.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.598
Yeah, I caught that, yeah.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.066
Well, shall I get to?

04:28.068 --> 04:29.201
This will work.

04:29.203 --> 04:30.535
Oh, well, not here!

04:30.537 --> 04:33.272
I created a special
sexual area for you.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.841
A performance zone,
if you will.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.418
I call it
the Masturbatorium.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.886
Hmm.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.389
Are you feeling
turned on?

04:50.391 --> 04:52.958
I'm feeling so
many things.

04:55.061 --> 04:56.595
Billie Jean King.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.263
Condi Rice.

04:58.265 --> 05:01.233
And of course, the guy
who played Bud in<i> Flipper.</i>

05:01.235 --> 05:02.934
Oh, no,
that's Janet Reno.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.770
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.805
Oh, what's with

05:06.807 --> 05:08.740
the, uh, babies?

05:08.742 --> 05:12.611
Oh, well, this is just to keep
your eyes on the prize.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.146
Ah.

05:14.914 --> 05:16.114
That's you

05:16.116 --> 05:18.250
just fertilizing
the garden of life

05:18.252 --> 05:20.085
with your seed.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.821
Man, this room is a friggin'
roller coaster ride.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.823
Isn't it fun?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.091
Yeah. (laughs)

05:26.093 --> 05:27.626
Yeah.
Okay, listen.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.261
I'm gonna give you
some privacy.

05:29.263 --> 05:30.262
Okay.
All right?

05:30.264 --> 05:31.263
Yeah.
Enjoy.

05:31.265 --> 05:32.597
Thank you.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.266
Be strong.
Just say it.

05:34.268 --> 05:36.301
Come on, Todd, you got this.

05:36.303 --> 05:39.438
Be the ball, man.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.772
Hey, Gail.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.808
Hey, Todd.
How you doing?

05:42.810 --> 05:44.009
I'm good. Look...

05:44.011 --> 05:45.444
I think we need
to talk about us.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.978
Yeah, right?

05:46.980 --> 05:49.014
Good, yeah, I do.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.950
Um, there's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

05:51.952 --> 05:52.951
Oh, great, well, you know,

05:52.953 --> 05:53.952
I'd like to start,
if you don't mind.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.854
No, I'll go first.
That's fine.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.622
You were such a lifesaver to me

05:57.624 --> 05:59.958
through the whole
Phil nightmare.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.994
I don't know how I would've
gotten through that without you.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.997
Oh, well, you know, look, okay,
well, here-here's the thing.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.467
No, there's something else.
Yeah.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.469
I put Gordon away.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.170
I don't need him anymore.

06:12.172 --> 06:15.140
'Cause you, Todd,
you're my new dummy.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.508
Your new-- the new du--

06:16.510 --> 06:18.310
your new dummy?
Mm-hmm.

06:18.312 --> 06:21.146
Okay, so it-it sounds to me
like you're pr-pretty,

06:21.148 --> 06:23.982
you know, into this whole,
uh, situation then.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.650
Right?
Why?

06:25.652 --> 06:27.652
Did you need to tell me
something, Todd?

06:27.654 --> 06:29.688
(stammers)
No, no-nothing really.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.190
Just a classic, you know,
ditto situation.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.326
You're a ditto situation.

06:34.328 --> 06:36.161
(chuckles)

06:36.163 --> 06:38.797
(both moaning)

06:46.339 --> 06:47.839
Nice job, Todd.

06:47.841 --> 06:51.009
Okay, got to go tell Melissa.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.879
Melissa, we need to talk.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.180
And I need to not talk.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.515
Well, that's your prerogative.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.716
I mean, talking is overrated.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.017
Not always,
but in this case, yeah.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.352
Damn it.

07:00.354 --> 07:02.587
(both moaning)

07:02.589 --> 07:04.356
It says here, when the
control line shows up,

07:04.358 --> 07:06.792
the test is active.

07:08.594 --> 07:11.430
TANDY:
And right on cue.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.865
Okay, so now we just have
to wait for the bottom line

07:13.867 --> 07:15.734
to tell us that your
sperm count is great.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.269
Oh, she's a-coming.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.037
(both chuckle)

07:19.039 --> 07:21.907
Any minute now.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.208
(chuckles)

07:23.210 --> 07:24.376
I'm sure it's fine.
Yeah.

07:24.378 --> 07:25.577
Yeah.
Oh, please.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.912
Carol, I know it is.

07:26.914 --> 07:29.080
I mean, this dish
is full of fish.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.450
Hey, hope I don't get
this test pregnant.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.451
Ooh.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.618
(both laughing)

07:35.888 --> 07:37.689
Okay, give me that, uh...

07:41.060 --> 07:43.094
Well, that can't be right.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.796
But that would mean...

07:49.602 --> 07:51.002
(stammers)
(gasps)

07:56.409 --> 07:59.411
You know, I bet my sperm count
was too high for the test.

07:59.413 --> 08:01.413
Yes, oh, definitely.

08:01.415 --> 08:03.415
Yeah.
Probably broke the barrier.

08:03.417 --> 08:05.750
What do we even know
about these things, anyway, huh?

08:05.752 --> 08:09.254
Oh, "made in China."

08:09.256 --> 08:11.923
They're probably calibrated
for Chinese sperm.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.291
Yeah.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.926
Oh, look, this one's expired!

08:14.928 --> 08:16.328
Oh, check the other ones.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.930
What, November 1, 2020.
Expired.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.799
August 23, 2021.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.100
(laughs)

08:22.102 --> 08:23.435
I knew it!

08:23.437 --> 08:25.103
Never use an expired
fertility test.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.304
That's the old saying.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.806
But if it's faulty,

08:27.808 --> 08:29.608
then why did
the control line show up?

08:29.610 --> 08:31.943
Proves even more
how screwed up they are.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.945
Look, why would a control line

08:33.947 --> 08:36.982
show up on a test where
the fertility line doesn't?

08:36.984 --> 08:38.517
Makes no sense.

08:39.619 --> 08:40.785
Okay, okay.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.187
If it makes you feel better,

08:42.189 --> 08:43.688
I'm gonna throw Todd
into the equation.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.290
Run his stuff
through the system,

08:45.292 --> 08:47.125
and when we see he gets
negative results,

08:47.127 --> 08:49.160
we'll know these things
are bogus.

08:49.162 --> 08:51.129
You are so smart.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.365
Hey, you said it, not me.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.433
But yeah.

08:56.469 --> 08:57.736
(sighs)

09:00.806 --> 09:02.307
Oh, gosh dang it.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.309
Look, just tell them the truth.

09:04.311 --> 09:05.644
You dirty dog, you...

09:05.646 --> 09:06.978
Having a little
one-on-one convo?

09:06.980 --> 09:08.013

Wait, is that Todd?

18:34.547 --> 18:36.447
ERICA:
He's still in his khakis.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.049
In his car keys?

18:38.051 --> 18:39.383
Sorry, "kya-kis, kya-kis."

18:39.385 --> 18:41.018
Okay, that's better.
Is that better?

18:43.422 --> 18:45.890
Look, I-I have something
important to say.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.458
Yeah, sorry, bud,
get in line.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.893
TODD: Tandy, I have
to do this now, man.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.895
Ugh, it'd better be

18:50.897 --> 18:52.296
super freaking
important, dude.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.297
It freaking is.
Ugh.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.233
(clears throat)

18:55.235 --> 18:57.135
Melissa...

18:58.570 --> 19:00.138
...I've been hooking
up with Gail.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.306
What the hell?

19:02.308 --> 19:04.575
Uh, Gail...

19:04.577 --> 19:07.111
I started re-hooking
up with Melissa.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.147
You whore.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.515
I'm not done just yet.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.752
I kissed Erica.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.088
I did not know that there was
a take-a-number situation.

19:17.090 --> 19:18.156
Gail, I thought
you were my friend.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.590
You were broken up.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.759
I'm the one that's
being double-timed here.

19:21.761 --> 19:25.329
Ladies, no, please, just...

19:25.331 --> 19:28.299
Whether you believe me or not,
I did this for you.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.768
I care about all of you
so much, really,

19:30.770 --> 19:32.837
and I don't want
you to hurt.

19:33.939 --> 19:37.308
I want to be
there for you.

19:37.310 --> 19:40.311
For all of you.

19:40.313 --> 19:45.183
And, damn it, I don't want
to do it behind your backs.

19:45.185 --> 19:48.119
So, with
that in mind,

19:48.121 --> 19:51.322
yeah, I mean... you know,
would it be so wrong

19:51.324 --> 19:55.493
if... we were,

19:55.495 --> 19:58.129
you know, I mean, uh,

19:58.131 --> 20:01.365
all... together?

20:01.367 --> 20:02.633
I mean,

20:02.635 --> 20:03.801
you know, I-I mean,
not-not like a...

20:03.803 --> 20:05.369
you know,
a<i> Big Love</i> situation.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.305
(chuckles)
You know?

20:07.307 --> 20:09.307
But more of like a...

20:09.309 --> 20:13.144

20:13.146 --> 20:15.880
situation.

20:17.983 --> 20:20.151
Well, uh, looks
like I'm up.

20:20.153 --> 20:21.852
Uh, that was super
gross, by the way.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.222
Uh, Carol.

20:26.158 --> 20:28.159
It's not you-- it's me.

20:28.161 --> 20:31.896
Yeah, I-I... I didn't have
the balls to tell you this,

20:31.898 --> 20:36.567
but... I don't have the
balls to have children.

20:39.171 --> 20:42.073
Carol, I'm sterile.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.874
Oh, my goll.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.176
Please don't leave me...

20:45.178 --> 20:46.143
