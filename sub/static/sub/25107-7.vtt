<i>Michael and the family attorney</i>

00:13.513 --> 00:16.808
<i>- were visiting Buster in jail.</i>
- I take it Mother's not coming.

00:16.891 --> 00:18.893
- Mom? No. She couldn't make it.
- Why is that?

00:18.977 --> 00:21.271
She said that I could make up
whatever reason I want.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.939
You tell me what is easiest on you.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.816
Hmm, no, it's too mean.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.276
I think you're entitled, Buster.

00:26.359 --> 00:27.527
She hates you, Michael.

00:28.194 --> 00:32.782
- We'll use that one. Sure.
- Mothers cannot accept the idea

00:32.866 --> 00:35.952
that they've raised someone
who could do something so vile.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.662
- What?
- In my case, twice. Well,

00:37.746 --> 00:39.622
two times, allegedly. Hey.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.791
This falls under client-attorney
privilege, right?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.960
Mother's disgusted by me.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.587
- No.
- She thinks I didn't just tamper

00:45.670 --> 00:48.840
with the evidence,
she thinks I tampered with Lucille 2.

00:48.923 --> 00:51.259
- No, no, no.
- She must think I'm guilty of murder.

00:51.342 --> 00:53.511
- Don't say that.
- Or she's busy frolicking

00:53.595 --> 00:54.721
on the beach with Dusty,

00:54.804 --> 00:56.765
- her trophy son.
- I should never have put

00:56.848 --> 00:58.099
that image in your mind.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.894
The good news is,
you thought I said "frolicking."

01:01.394 --> 01:02.979
I don't think it's that.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.605
She knows more than she's letting on.

01:04.688 --> 01:07.442
Like where Lucille 2 actually is.
Think about it.

01:07.525 --> 01:08.735
She made a deal with her.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.612
Or maybe she just tricked her
to leave town.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.614
I don't know,
but there is something going on,

01:12.697 --> 01:14.157
and she needs to let that play out,

01:14.240 --> 01:16.284
even if you need to stay in prison
a little while.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.702
No pounding!

01:17.786 --> 01:19.621
She holds the keys to my freedom,

01:19.704 --> 01:22.123
and she won't use it
until she gets her selfish needs met.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.000
Like when she used to lock me
in the bathroom

01:24.084 --> 01:26.044
for grown-up selfish needs night.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.421
- Oh, did we have a good time.
- What?

01:28.505 --> 01:31.174
- No, it ended in tears.
- Guys, hey, let's focus.

01:31.257 --> 01:34.094
I'm wondering if there is a way
we can get Mom to think

01:34.177 --> 01:36.930
that the DA is onto whatever
her scheme is, like,

01:37.472 --> 01:39.933
we tell Mom that the DA knows
where there is some evidence,

01:40.016 --> 01:43.269
and then, Mom or Dad slip out
and try to get rid of it.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.896
And then I follow them.

01:44.979 --> 01:47.649
What evidence should
we say they have, Michael?

01:48.024 --> 01:51.402
Lucille 2's head in a box?

01:51.486 --> 01:53.071
- Spooky.
- Well, no. Hang on.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.739
That's... It's gotta be real.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.825
Okay, so, if it's gotta be real,

01:56.908 --> 01:58.785
how about the DA is close to locating

01:58.868 --> 02:01.121
the stair car that she was last seen on,

02:01.204 --> 02:03.623
because they have a picture of it
from a security cam

02:03.706 --> 02:05.667
- or traffic light cam?
- That's getting there.

02:05.750 --> 02:09.963
Okay, now inside the stair car
are two heads.

02:10.713 --> 02:13.842
One bald, one spiky.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.677
- Spooky.
- No. I loved it, all the way up

02:15.760 --> 02:17.470
till the end. I think stair car's plenty.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.931
- Okay.
- Why don't I have the family

02:20.014 --> 02:22.475
gather at the beach cottage
about 3:00?

02:22.559 --> 02:25.270
You call me.
You tell me you found out they've got

02:25.353 --> 02:26.813
the stair car evidence, and I wait

02:26.896 --> 02:28.773
for either Mom or Dad
to make their next move.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.233
Any questions?

02:30.817 --> 02:32.485
What's the beach cottage?

02:32.944 --> 02:33.903
I found out, Buster.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.530
- Oh.
- What a relief.

02:35.613 --> 02:37.615
- Yeah.
- I almost said "the cottage."

02:37.699 --> 02:39.450
I changed it to
"ing on the beach."

02:39.534 --> 02:41.119
- It's "frolicking."
- "Frolicking."

02:41.703 --> 02:43.496
<i>Now,</i>
<i>the story of a wealthy family</i>

02:43.580 --> 02:46.666
<i>who lost everything,
and the one son who had no choice</i>

02:46.749 --> 02:48.334
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

02:54.340 --> 02:56.050
<i>It's </i> Arrested Development.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.974
<i>Michael group-texted his family
to meet at the cottage,</i>

03:03.057 --> 03:04.601
<i>but accidentally included...</i>

03:04.684 --> 03:06.269
- Gangee's renting this place?
<i>- ...his son.</i>

03:06.352 --> 03:09.063
No, this is her place.
It's been in the family forever.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.732
They never told either of us, huh?

03:10.815 --> 03:12.609
- Oh.
- Says "Maeby" here.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.152
What?

03:14.777 --> 03:17.989
How dare they keep track of
my height while not telling me?

03:18.615 --> 03:20.033
Mm-hmm.

03:20.116 --> 03:21.868
So, how did it go with Rebel's family?

03:21.951 --> 03:23.912
You guys seem
really buddy-buddy on Instagram.

03:25.371 --> 03:27.248
<i>I also saw that that hair thing backfired,
huh?</i>

03:27.332 --> 03:30.084
Yeah, it was great.
I mean, they're just such a nice...

03:30.585 --> 03:32.879
I don't want to use "family,"
'cause they like each other,

03:32.962 --> 03:34.547
but they're a nice group of people.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.341
I think I really like her.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.426
Isn't it still weird with your dad?

03:38.509 --> 03:40.178
Well, maybe that was just me.

03:40.470 --> 03:43.723
I'm worried she might have been seeing
her ex all summer.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.725
- Your dad?
- No, no. On the movie set,

03:45.808 --> 03:46.726
down in Mexico.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.687
Didn't your dad say
he was down in Mexico, too?

03:50.939 --> 03:53.858
- They shoot a lot of things there.
- Mm-hmm.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.902
It was fun. I'm not gonna see her
for the next few days,

03:55.985 --> 03:57.946
'cause she's going
to Mexico for reshoots.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.739
Reshoots? Oof.

03:59.822 --> 04:02.450
She must not be a very good
actress, huh?

04:02.533 --> 04:03.910
Hope she gets it right this time.

04:03.993 --> 04:05.703
Well, she's not perfect, but, uh,

04:05.787 --> 04:08.957
it doesn't turn my stomach
to see her eat an ice cream cone.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.000
Speaking of that,
how are things with Stan?

04:11.084 --> 04:13.461
Did he finish that ice cream cone
after I looked away?

04:13.544 --> 04:16.047
I don't know.
I threw away all the ice cream.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.632
But, not to make you jealous,

04:17.714 --> 04:20.134
turns out we <i>are </i> dating.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.055
For some reason,
he wants to wait till after the election

04:24.138 --> 04:25.765
to be what he likes to call "intimate."

04:26.057 --> 04:29.727
<i>In fact, Stan was waiting</i>
<i>so there would be no scandal...</i>

04:29.811 --> 04:32.730
You gotta try this new eyebrow glue.
You can eat soup again.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.774
<i>...especially once his daughter
joined the race.</i>

04:34.857 --> 04:36.609
Have you thought about what I asked?

04:36.693 --> 04:38.194
You have to run for office.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.113
You said we couldn't risk it,

04:40.196 --> 04:43.408
with... with Lucille 2 missing.

04:43.491 --> 04:45.326
That's the best part. She's gone.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.537
I'm dating this woman
who's a gossip hound.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.832
Somehow, she got intel that
Lindsay Bluth has skipped town.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.418
- But the Bluths are running her anyway.
- Oh.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.795
It would be nice to oppose
Lindsay's sudden interest

04:55.878 --> 04:57.630
in building this awful border wall.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.340
Which was my idea.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.843
I have to say, Dad,

05:01.926 --> 05:04.429
I'm surprised you're taking
such an interest in this race.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.474
If you tried the new eyebrow glue,
you could <i>look </i> surprised, too.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.977
<i>He expects sex</i>
<i>after the election?</i>

05:11.060 --> 05:12.603
What are you gonna do?
That's in two days.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.689
I know. I mean,
I can't let the guy see me naked,

05:14.772 --> 05:16.816
'cause, not to brag, but, you know,

05:16.899 --> 05:19.610
there's not a lot of 75-year-old women
who got a body like this.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.863
- You know?
- I don't think that's bragging.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.824
Wow.
Well, I guess you are jealous, huh?

05:25.408 --> 05:27.618
I'm waiting to hear from Barry,

05:27.702 --> 05:29.746
so I don't have
too much new information.

05:29.829 --> 05:33.291
Uh, Barry's probably trying to mitigate
the damage you caused

05:33.374 --> 05:35.501
by taunting Buster with a skinhead.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.545
Okay,
you gotta blame Buster for that.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.881
Say what you will about Ron Howard
as a filmmaker,

05:39.964 --> 05:42.133
but the man is not a Nazi sympathizer.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.135
- <i>Thanks.</i>
- I've heard things

05:44.218 --> 05:46.721
about what's really going on
in that Grinch movie he made.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.849
You know, that anti-Christmas thing,
with the Who-ish people?

05:49.932 --> 05:51.476
I don't know what you want me to say.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.311
I offered to talk to the DA.
You shot that down.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.855
Lottie-Dottie-DA?
Oh, she's a shark, Michael.

05:55.938 --> 05:58.524
I don't want you swimming
anywhere near her.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.401
Especially after you tried
to drown yourself

06:00.485 --> 06:02.153
in the bay the other day.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.405
We're sticking with that, huh?

06:04.489 --> 06:07.033
Mom, if you're not gonna bail out Buster,

06:07.116 --> 06:08.993
- you can visit.
- And risk having

06:09.077 --> 06:11.245
a story come out
that I went to a prison

06:11.329 --> 06:13.581
to visit my son before the election?

06:13.664 --> 06:15.583
That would be bad for Lindsay's campaign.

06:15.666 --> 06:18.336
So the plan is to run her,
even though she's not here?

06:18.419 --> 06:19.504
- Yes.
- Got it.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.464
Especially now that Sally's in the race.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.217
Tobias better find Lindsay
before the 4th of July parade,

06:24.300 --> 06:25.885
which is on the 2nd.

06:25.968 --> 06:28.429
- The 4th of July parade is on the 2nd?
- Mm.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.973
Yes. They moved it
because they don't want the Hispanics

06:31.057 --> 06:33.935
to get even by using up
all the supplies a day early

06:34.018 --> 06:35.395
like we do with Cinco.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.898
Yeah, and good luck using
the 4th of July fireworks on the 3rd,

06:38.981 --> 06:40.817
because we will have done it
on the 2nd.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.320
By the way, guys,
as far as the Bluth company float goes,

06:45.029 --> 06:47.573
I bet you guys are thinking, uh,
will he, won't he?

06:47.657 --> 06:49.367
- "Willy Wondy?"
- Who's Willy Wondy?

06:50.076 --> 06:52.453
"Will he, won't he"
do magic on our float.

06:52.537 --> 06:54.038
- Won't he.
- Tony?

06:54.122 --> 06:55.998
- Did you say Tony?
- Won't he.

06:56.082 --> 06:59.210
Wonder. What? Why are you trying
to say "Tony Wonder"?

06:59.293 --> 07:00.878
- No one's saying Tony...
- Stay out of it!

07:00.962 --> 07:03.172
Why are you saying Tony Wonder?
Is he doing a trick?

07:03.256 --> 07:04.298
No one's saying that

07:04.382 --> 07:06.467
- or asking anything.
- Good.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.760
Let's keep it that way.

07:10.179 --> 07:13.474
Anyway, you're probably saying
or wondering... Now I'm doing it.

07:16.352 --> 07:18.896
...why I won't be doing
a magic show on our float.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.523
And the answer is:

07:21.482 --> 07:23.234
because I've been asked
to do so on another float.

07:23.317 --> 07:26.696
A great company, Laguna Closet
Conversions. Know those guys?

07:26.779 --> 07:28.072
It's not what you think.

07:28.156 --> 07:31.784
They, like, convert closets
to, like, organize and stuff.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.286
Who would think anything different?

07:33.369 --> 07:35.037
<i>This geo-bead would.</i>

07:35.121 --> 07:37.540
So, what do we have to do
to get you into a closet, huh?

07:37.623 --> 07:41.169
Wow, you guys don't mince words,
huh?

07:41.252 --> 07:45.131
<i>After realizing his friendship</i>
<i>with Tony Wonder was over...</i>

07:45.214 --> 07:47.049
<i>I don't think we can hang out.</i>

07:47.133 --> 07:50.720
<i>...Gob, desperate to push</i>
<i>his feelings back into the closet,</i>

07:50.803 --> 07:53.598
<i>decided conversion therapy
was the only answer.</i>

07:53.681 --> 07:56.350
- We're different.
<i>- Although, it's worth noting</i>

07:56.434 --> 07:57.935
<i>he didn't do a lot of research.</i>

07:58.019 --> 07:59.937
<i>Plus, it's great</i>
<i>for your resale value.</i>

08:00.021 --> 08:01.814
How's your resale value now?

08:01.898 --> 08:04.150
<i>Gob didn't want to let on</i>
<i>that he didn't know</i>

08:04.233 --> 08:07.278
<i>what "resale value" was gay slang for.</i>

08:08.070 --> 08:09.989
I've never had any complaints.

08:10.531 --> 08:12.742
Let's talk about you.
The more we know about you,

08:12.825 --> 08:14.744
the happier you're gonna be
with your results.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.748
I love Tony Wonder.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.919
I guess you want the details.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.296
- Anyway, it's...
<i>- Gob told the closet salesmen</i>

08:25.379 --> 08:27.048
<i>all about his night with Tony,</i>

08:27.131 --> 08:29.342
<i>and how devastated he was
by being ghosted.</i>

08:29.425 --> 08:31.302
...Michael walked in,
I had to waste my roofie...

08:31.385 --> 08:33.596
But he doesn't remember...
Him, with my...

08:33.679 --> 08:36.933
I guess that's how we're different,
in the same way.

08:38.808 --> 08:39.644
We should put him

08:39.769 --> 08:41.645
in the Catalina cedar walk-in

08:41.729 --> 08:43.773
with the pocket doors
and the floor lighting.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.985
<i>And that's when Gob</i>
<i>realized his mistake.</i>

08:52.031 --> 08:55.117
<i>But keep in mind,
we edited, like, an hour out of this.</i>

08:55.493 --> 08:58.829
What are the confidentiality laws
concerning people

08:58.913 --> 09:00.331
who walk into a closet store?

09:00.998 --> 09:03.251
<i>They're kind of sane</i>
<i>and, you know, they just,</i>

09:03.334 --> 09:05.169
they listen, they're good...
and they work for us

09:05.253 --> 09:06.295
'cause I bought the company.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.964
Ah. Oh.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.924
Hang on, this might be him. It is.

09:10.007 --> 09:12.343
- Barry.
<i>- Michael, I'm calling you,</i>

09:12.426 --> 09:13.886
<i>I've got new info. It can be whatever</i>

09:13.970 --> 09:15.846
you want to say, I'm saying.

09:15.930 --> 09:19.016
I understand, so you are saying...

09:19.100 --> 09:20.685
<i>I'm not saying anything.</i>

09:20.768 --> 09:22.645
- I didn't think I had to.
<i>- I see.</i>

09:22.728 --> 09:26.274
- What does that mean, "discovered"?
- <i>Oh, they're listening, right?</i>

09:26.357 --> 09:28.651
If they're listening, just say "dogshit."

09:28.734 --> 09:32.363
Mm. What you said, I would repeat,

09:32.446 --> 09:34.532
but the family is here,
and I want to make sure

09:34.615 --> 09:37.034
- that I don't get it wrong.
<i>- Get it wrong?</i>

09:37.118 --> 09:38.744
<i>- Say "dogshit."</i>
- Apparently, they know

09:38.828 --> 09:41.455
where the stair car is,
and they might even know

09:41.539 --> 09:44.417
where Lucille 2 is,
which means they will talk to her,

09:44.500 --> 09:46.586
and we'll get all this sorted out.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.089
- Did I get that right?
- <i>Well, with two heads in it.</i>

09:50.381 --> 09:52.592
One spiky one and one bald one.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.343
<i>No, that's plenty.</i>

09:54.427 --> 09:56.679
- Thank you. Good job, Barry.
<i>- Know what's funny?</i>

09:56.762 --> 09:59.390
In the 30 years that
I've represented this family,

09:59.473 --> 10:02.059
<i>that is the first time anyone
has said "good j..."</i>

10:02.143 --> 10:03.728
Well, listen.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.187
If that's all true,

10:05.271 --> 10:07.732
they might be closer to figuring
this out than we thought.

10:07.815 --> 10:10.443
<i>And now,</i>
<i>Michael had to just sit back</i>

10:10.526 --> 10:12.903
<i>and wait for something
out of the ordinary to happen.</i>

10:12.987 --> 10:13.863
I'm gonna take off.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.991
And I'll check back on you later
and we can, uh...

10:17.074 --> 10:19.994
Um, can I speak to you privately
for a moment?

10:20.119 --> 10:21.120
Oh. Yeah?

10:21.203 --> 10:22.455
You need to speak privately?

10:22.538 --> 10:25.333
Oh, it's just so mundane.
I don't want to bore everyone.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.710
- It's just so mundane.
- I'll get out of your hair.

10:29.545 --> 10:32.006
<i>And Michael went</i>
<i>to stake out the parking lot.</i>

10:32.089 --> 10:34.759
- Hey, Dad. Wait. You're leaving?
- Hey.

10:34.842 --> 10:36.218
You never even said hello.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.054
- Yeah, I just...
- Or good-bye.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.973
- Thank you for coming out.
- I was glad to come out

10:41.057 --> 10:42.266
because I have some good news.

10:42.350 --> 10:45.311
Um, do you still need
that 50 grand for Buster's bail?

10:45.394 --> 10:47.063
Because I can get that
from the business.

10:47.146 --> 10:50.691
No. No, no, no, no. I told you
I'm not gonna be taking your money.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.693
And it's 75 grand
that I'm not gonna be taking

10:52.777 --> 10:53.944
because the bail went up.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.863
Buster tried to strangle a, uh...

10:55.946 --> 10:58.324
Well, he technically
did strangle a skinhead.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.201
- Very cool.
- I guess, in a way.

11:00.284 --> 11:03.371
Now that we're talking about money,
I want to tell you,

11:03.454 --> 11:05.414
I couldn't be more proud
of what you've been able

11:05.498 --> 11:07.500
to do with the Fakeblock thing.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.127
But with this kind of success,
it puts a target on your back.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.963
People are gonna think,
"Here comes the next Steve Gobs."

11:13.047 --> 11:14.090
- They're gonna want...
- Jobs.

11:14.173 --> 11:16.133
Jobs, for sure,
but they're also gonna want money.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.594
And don't be throwing it away.
Not just to family.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.554
Be careful with friends, too.

11:20.638 --> 11:23.015
New friends,
a girlfriend that might be trying

11:23.099 --> 11:25.309
to slow things down.
Isn't that what you...

11:25.393 --> 11:27.269
Isn't that how you described it?

11:27.353 --> 11:28.604
- With Rebel?
- Huh? Yeah.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.856
She just works a lot.
She's in Mexico right now.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.233
But we're better than ever.

11:32.316 --> 11:34.735
Actually, that money that I mentioned?
That was from Rebel.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.862
You know, to be a friend and support me.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.949
Oh, boy. There's some of that
Hollywood BS. There it is.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.784
Right there.
That's how they use people.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.744
That's the culture there,
and I want to make sure

11:43.828 --> 11:45.329
you don't give too much away.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.914
Don't change yourself.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.624
You don't change your look

11:49.083 --> 11:50.835
to be a part of the gang.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.463
You talking about my hair?

11:54.547 --> 11:55.881
Why'd you dye your hair?

11:55.965 --> 11:57.341
Come on.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.676
<i>George Michael</i>
<i>couldn't tell his father</i>

11:58.759 --> 12:01.178
<i>that he'd attempted
to dye his hair pink</i>

12:01.262 --> 12:03.097
<i>- to push Rebel away.</i>
- Um...

12:03.180 --> 12:04.515
Yeah, I guess, you know,

12:04.598 --> 12:06.892
so... so Rebel would think
that I was cool.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.979
- I see.
- Look at this.

12:10.062 --> 12:13.107
Three generations of Bluths
in one place.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.859
Anybody have a camera?

12:14.942 --> 12:16.235
- On my phone.
- Yes, sir.

12:16.318 --> 12:17.278
Oh, no.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.029
It's a figure of speech. I gotta run.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.490
Where you off to, Dad?
I could run some errands.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.576
- Need a hop on?
- No, thanks.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.911
Personal business. Heading northward.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.831
Okay. I'm actually
complete opposite direction.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.249
Where you heading, Dad?

12:30.332 --> 12:31.584
Uh, west.

12:31.667 --> 12:34.170
Well, I'll hang out with you
at the, uh, beach.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.131
Oh, uh... No.
Why did I say west?

12:37.214 --> 12:40.217
East is where I'm going.
Northeast. Northeast, actually.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.052
I'm going up to Search campus.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.805
I love the idea of you going to the beach.
Do that.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.266
Make sure
it doesn't turn your hair red again.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.935
And, Dad... Well, he's gone.
Okay, I gotta go.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.022
How'd you know I had red hair?

12:54.815 --> 12:56.567
- Did you see it on Instagram?
- Yes.

12:56.650 --> 12:59.236
I did. I did. I did.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.197
I just didn't want to embarrass you.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.656
Showed up on my e-mail
this morning.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.325
So you use Instagram?

13:05.743 --> 13:08.704
Mm-mm. No, no.
Your uncle showed it to me.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.790
You know me. I'm a 20th-century guy.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.625
You can keep that futuristic stuff.

13:12.708 --> 13:13.793
Okay?

13:14.376 --> 13:15.711
Okay. Prismo.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.755
Begin.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.049
User, Michael Bluth. Lost my keys.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.384
Okay, Prismo, reverse.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.553
<i>I will. And how was...</i>

13:24.637 --> 13:27.264
- <i>Mom's fucking cottage</i>
<i>- ...with Gob.</i>

13:27.348 --> 13:29.183
<i>And so,</i>
<i>a suspicious Michael took off</i>

13:29.266 --> 13:30.559
<i>after his father...</i>

13:35.272 --> 13:37.983
- He was there.
<i>- ...while his own son...</i>

13:38.067 --> 13:39.652
Where are you going?

13:39.735 --> 13:41.946
<i>...found himself</i>
<i>feeling suspicious as well.</i>

13:43.864 --> 13:44.865
<i>And Barry</i>

13:44.949 --> 13:46.492
<i>showed up at the cottage
to make sure</i>

13:46.575 --> 13:47.743
<i>the scheme had worked.</i>

13:47.827 --> 13:50.079
You are here. Why was Michael

13:50.162 --> 13:52.748
- so stingy with the dogshit?
- What are you doing here?

13:52.832 --> 13:55.584
Was Michael lying about talking
to you on the phone just now?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.044
Oh, no. That was me.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.380
I just wanted to see
how Michael was enjoying

13:59.463 --> 14:01.465
- knowing about the cottage.
- You want to know

14:01.549 --> 14:04.260
if we fell for Michael's
and your little trap.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.886
It was a trap, wasn't it?

14:05.970 --> 14:08.639
You're wrong.
Why would I do that?

14:08.722 --> 14:10.266
Because he paid your bail
and threatened

14:10.349 --> 14:12.309
to make trouble if you didn't play along.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.435
You're right.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.436
I knew it.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.647
The DA has a picture of the stair car?

14:17.147 --> 14:19.024
Like Lucille 2 would be stupid enough

14:19.108 --> 14:21.318
to disappear in a truck
with her name on it?

14:21.402 --> 14:23.779
- What kind of lie is that?
- I totally agree with you.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.282
A good lie is head in a box,

14:26.365 --> 14:28.659
but they wanted
to go with something real,

14:28.742 --> 14:32.288
so we went with the evidence
they actually had.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.206
This is real?

14:34.290 --> 14:37.251
Yeah, and he doesn't want
to use the best part, the two heads.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.253
One spiky, one bald.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.797
Lucille 2 and Oscar.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.383
That idiot.
I told him to keep her out of sight.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.218
Speaking of out of sight,

14:46.302 --> 14:48.304
do you know where your husband is
with that Winnebago?

14:48.387 --> 14:50.180
Because since I got
out of prison,

14:50.264 --> 14:52.725
George is letting me stay there,
without him knowing it.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.476
- I don't know where he went.
- Hmm.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.521
Maybe he went to find Oscar,
warn him about the picture.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.148
You think he really did?

14:59.231 --> 15:01.650
I think the prosecution
gave us this picture

15:01.734 --> 15:05.195
so that George or you
would lead them to Lucille 2.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.156
Go find him. Track him down.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.408
Get to him before he finds Lucille 2.

15:09.491 --> 15:14.038
I will not let that woman steal
everything I've taken from her.

15:17.833 --> 15:20.711
<i>George Sr. turned south</i>
<i>on Coast Highway,</i>

15:20.794 --> 15:23.505
<i>unaware he was being followed
by Michael,</i>

15:23.589 --> 15:26.216
<i>unaware </i> he <i>was being followed</i>
<i>by George Michael.</i>

15:35.726 --> 15:38.854
- <i>Maeby? Hello?</i>
- I think my phone's ringing.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.440
<i>Maeby. Hello?</i>
<i>Come on. Hello?</i>

15:41.523 --> 15:43.025
- Hello?
- <i>It's me.</i>

15:43.108 --> 15:45.152
<i>I know you're not old.
Can we have a system</i>

15:45.235 --> 15:47.279
<i>where I don't have to wait
the 40 seconds?</i>

15:47.363 --> 15:48.781
Look, I have to be careful, okay?

15:48.864 --> 15:50.491
These are not tech-savvy people.

15:50.574 --> 15:52.451
The other day,
I turned the lounge TV on,

15:52.534 --> 15:53.911
and now that's my job.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.246
They call me "Buttons" now. Buttons.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.832
- He's going to meet Rebel.
- <i>Who? Your dad?</i>

15:58.916 --> 16:00.000
I think you were right.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.169
<i>They were together in Mexico,
and that's why</i>

16:02.252 --> 16:03.587
<i>my dad has been weird with me.</i>

16:03.671 --> 16:05.756
Wow, I was just "specu-lying."

16:06.131 --> 16:07.549
<i>Well, you nailed it, Buttons.</i>

16:07.633 --> 16:10.094
And he probably made plans
to see her this time in Mexico

16:10.177 --> 16:12.388
when I said my relationship
was slowing down.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.515
You know,
it's hard to believe because...

16:14.598 --> 16:16.225
my niece always told me

16:16.308 --> 16:18.227
<i>never to give away
my Social Security number,</i>

16:18.310 --> 16:20.729
but if it really is
a free trip to Aruba...

16:20.813 --> 16:22.314
Oh, you have to go, Buttons.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.983
Sign me up!

16:24.566 --> 16:25.693
Peg's walking by.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.277
<i>No, you have to.</i>

16:27.361 --> 16:30.406
He lied about being
at the Howard barbecue. He was there.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.409
Wow, and I thought my parents
were the selfish ones.

16:33.492 --> 16:36.161
At least my mom never tried to sleep
with somebody I was da...

16:36.245 --> 16:38.580
Oh, wait. No. Steve Holt.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.666
Uh, but he's family.

16:40.749 --> 16:42.668
We've got to stop the lying
in this family.

16:42.751 --> 16:45.129
<i>Tell me about it.
You tell one little story</i>

16:45.212 --> 16:47.131
to get a place to live.
Next thing you know,

16:47.214 --> 16:48.966
you're sorting through
your roommate's pills

16:49.049 --> 16:50.718
to figure out which one
will kill his sex drive.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.761
- Like estrogen?
- <i>Wait, that's a thing?</i>

16:53.470 --> 16:55.305
I mean, I was just day plotting.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.141
Stop right there.
The minute you start talking

16:57.224 --> 16:59.226
about neutering your romantic partner,

16:59.309 --> 17:01.520
<i>you're into shit
that even Gangee wouldn't do.</i>

17:01.603 --> 17:02.896
The monster or the grandmother?

17:02.980 --> 17:04.690
<i>The monster.
But, yeah, I don't think</i>

17:04.771 --> 17:06.483
our grandmother would do that.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.819
<i>Yeah, maybe it is too far.
I guess I can just</i>

17:08.902 --> 17:11.655
pretend like I have an illness
where I forget everything.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.115
<i>Like Alzheimer's?</i>

17:13.198 --> 17:15.701
That's a thing, too?
I was just crime-storming.

17:15.784 --> 17:18.162
You know, just lying out loud.
How funny.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.497
<i>Gob was having trouble</i>

17:20.579 --> 17:22.540
<i>forgetting someone himself.</i>

17:22.624 --> 17:24.501
Okay? Now you're gonna be
in the closet...

17:24.585 --> 17:27.212
<i>Which was why he was distracted</i>

17:27.296 --> 17:30.674
<i>as the closet guys helped him
with his parade float illusion.</i>

17:30.758 --> 17:34.094
Sorry. I'm still really torn up
about this love affair with Tony,

17:34.178 --> 17:36.430
which, if you guys mention,
you're fired.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.348
We can't change
your feelings, okay?

17:38.432 --> 17:41.268
But we can change whether Tony
is in your life.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.480
After you left,
we got to talking about you, and...

17:44.813 --> 17:45.898
You're a magician,

17:45.981 --> 17:48.650
he's a magician...
Go double magician.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.527
Two guys, one trick.
Do an act together.

17:51.028 --> 17:54.948
God.
Why are all the cute ones so dumb?

17:55.741 --> 17:57.576
Look, guys, this is not that hard.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.787
I am pretending to be
a Christian magician.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.914
Tony's pretending
to be a gay magician.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.208
We're like oil and vinegar.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.168
What trick is gonna have room for both?

18:06.251 --> 18:09.296
Yes, everyone could be smarter,
that's true,

18:09.379 --> 18:11.131
but what we meant was that

18:11.215 --> 18:14.510
we could book you <i>and </i> Tony
to do a trick on our float.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.721
Yeah. A classic two-fister.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.933
An old-fashioned will he, won't he?

18:21.850 --> 18:24.978
We're just gonna need the perfect trick.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.856
We're wasting daylight.
Let's do this.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.360
What did we decide on?
Sorry, I...

18:31.443 --> 18:34.363
<i>And soon, George Sr. arrived</i>
<i>at the border...</i>

18:37.866 --> 18:39.409
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Dad.</i>

18:39.493 --> 18:40.744
<i>...two cars ahead of...</i>

18:40.828 --> 18:43.956
Michael. I thought I'd give you a call,
see how the drive

18:44.039 --> 18:46.166
<i>- north is going.</i>
- Oh, it's fine.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.378
<i>I took Highway 5,
so there's, you know, no view,</i>

18:49.461 --> 18:50.754
but there's no traffic.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.381
<i>What's the bell?</i>

18:52.464 --> 18:55.676
Oh, there's this Salvation Army
Santa Claus guy

18:55.759 --> 18:57.886
who's just going from car to car here.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.388
Ice cream?

18:59.471 --> 19:02.141
<i>Stop screaming</i>
<i>and get off the highway!</i>

19:02.224 --> 19:04.434
Oh, there's an Andersen's Pea Soup,

19:04.518 --> 19:07.646
so I think I'm gonna buy him soup.

19:07.729 --> 19:09.439
<i>That's George Michael.</i>
<i>I gotta go.</i>

19:09.523 --> 19:12.484
I hope that I'm half the father
to him that you are to me.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.861
You're embarrassing me.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.404
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- You should be.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.406
George Michael.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.825
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>where are you?</i>

19:19.908 --> 19:22.953
I'm approaching,
uh, Andersen's Pea Soup.

19:23.036 --> 19:26.206
<i>Oh, that's north.
You said you were going northeast.</i>

19:26.331 --> 19:29.626
Well, I'm headed north,
then I'm headed east.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.713
Otherwise you don't
pass the Andersen's P.S.

19:32.796 --> 19:33.755
Oh, right.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.757
<i>Michael felt doubly guilty</i>

19:35.841 --> 19:38.802
<i>for not just telling a lie,
but stealing one.</i>

19:38.886 --> 19:40.762
- What's that bell?
<i>- That's, uh,</i>

19:40.846 --> 19:42.764
we got a Danish girl ringing a bell

19:42.848 --> 19:45.434
- in front of, uh, A's Pea Soup.
- Ice cream?

19:46.101 --> 19:47.769
Ice cream?
What's that about ice cream?

19:47.853 --> 19:50.230
<i>No, thank you. Uh, </i> nein, danke.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.899
Big boy, I gotta go. Okay?

19:51.982 --> 19:53.984
<i>- I'll talk to you later.</i>
- Love you.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.865
<i>They made their way</i>
<i>through the border crossing.</i>

19:59.948 --> 20:01.074
Next one.

20:02.409 --> 20:03.911
Oh.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.954
He's going to Father B's.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.957
<i>Which, to Barry,</i>
<i>could only mean one thing.</i>

20:09.041 --> 20:10.918
I have time for an ice cream.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.045
- Ice cream!
<i>- In fact,</i>

20:13.128 --> 20:15.255
<i>George Sr. was returning to property</i>

20:15.339 --> 20:19.134
<i>he used as a motivational
retreat called Father B's</i>

20:19.218 --> 20:21.053
<i>for the first time in months.</i>

20:21.136 --> 20:24.765
<i>And, unseen, Michael snuck
into his blind spot.</i>

20:26.099 --> 20:29.186
Of course this is where
they'd hide Lucille 2.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.118
- Mm.
- Hey.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.788
How'd Santa like his pea soup?

20:48.455 --> 20:50.874
Michael, uh...
What are you doing here?

20:50.958 --> 20:54.211
Figuring out why you lied
about where you were going.

20:54.294 --> 20:57.297
I didn't want you to know.
I was embarrassed.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.550
I would've been embarrassed
if I was making Buster rot in prison,

21:00.634 --> 21:02.928
while I was hiding Lucille
down in Mexico.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.805
Hiding Lucille?
What are you talking about?

21:04.888 --> 21:07.057
I set you up.
I told you that the DA

21:07.140 --> 21:09.101
found the stair car.
You took the bait and you had

21:09.184 --> 21:11.186
that private conversation with Mom.
She said to you,

21:11.270 --> 21:13.689
"Make sure Lucille 2 stays hidden."
Did she not say that?

21:13.772 --> 21:15.315
- Tell me she didn't.
<i>- She didn't.</i>

21:15.399 --> 21:17.776
- It's so mundane.
<i>- </i> Let me get out of your hair.

21:17.859 --> 21:19.987
<i>Lucille had something else</i>
<i>on her mind.</i>

21:20.070 --> 21:22.364
I know you said
you wanted to check in on me,

21:22.447 --> 21:24.241
and I have plans with Dusty,

21:24.324 --> 21:26.702
and I didn't want you
to find us together

21:26.785 --> 21:28.120
and get your feelings
hurt tonight.

21:28.203 --> 21:30.664
So you want to hurt my feelings
now instead?

21:31.248 --> 21:33.500
- To get it out of the way.
- Is that it, or are you afraid

21:33.583 --> 21:35.460
- I'll tear him in two?
- Hey.

21:35.544 --> 21:38.588
If you could tear anything in two,
you'd still have a shot at me.

21:38.672 --> 21:42.384
Okay, you want to see
a real man, you're going to.

21:42.884 --> 21:45.721
I know. I just didn't want you
to see me with him.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.766
Don't cry.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.101
Then,

21:51.184 --> 21:52.811
what are you doing down here?

21:53.228 --> 21:54.896
This is where the curse began.

21:54.980 --> 21:59.609
This is where that guy
turned me into Oscar, and Oscar...

22:00.193 --> 22:01.570
- into me.
- Mm.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.530
<i>Years earlier,</i>
<i>when Oscar introduced</i>

22:03.613 --> 22:05.198
<i>George Sr. to maca...</i>

22:05.282 --> 22:06.867
The strong will become the weak,

22:06.950 --> 22:08.952
the weak will become the strong.

22:09.036 --> 22:10.662
<i>...the brothers had
an ominous vision.</i>

22:10.746 --> 22:12.581
Probably so they can build
a border wall.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.790
They want to separate...

22:13.874 --> 22:15.417
<i>Which is what</i>
<i>Lindsay's boyfriend</i>

22:15.500 --> 22:16.918
<i>wanted them to think.</i>

22:17.002 --> 22:19.796
You don't believe that maca
does all this crap, do you?

22:19.880 --> 22:21.340
George!

22:24.176 --> 22:26.595
- You see that?
- I have something for you!

22:26.678 --> 22:28.847
Great spirit,
that's why I'm here!

22:28.930 --> 22:31.016
My son doesn't believe.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.186
Please, take his strength,
and give it to me!

22:34.269 --> 22:37.230
- Take it easy.
- No, it's me, Tobias.

22:37.856 --> 22:41.485
Fünke. I'm still legally
recognized as your son-in-law.

22:41.568 --> 22:44.488
- Why are you dressed like that?
- Humorous anecdote.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.075
Oh.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.369
Ugh... Come...

22:52.079 --> 22:53.246
One...

22:54.039 --> 22:55.165
Here... here it comes.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.754
<i>Well, maybe I'll jump in here.</i>

23:00.837 --> 23:03.340
<i>After being kicked off
Father B's land,</i>

23:03.423 --> 23:06.718
<i>the men finally found their way
to Marky Bark's trailer.</i>

23:06.802 --> 23:09.930
It was worth it. Now you know
how to do a proper spit take.

23:10.013 --> 23:13.100
Now, if Lindsay's here,
let me do the talking.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.102
Hello?

23:15.185 --> 23:17.104
- No water.
- Oh, uh,

23:17.229 --> 23:18.814
we're looking for Lindsay.

23:18.897 --> 23:20.816
Lindsay? That dumb blonde slut

23:20.899 --> 23:23.485
my moron son keeps calling
every five minutes

23:23.568 --> 23:25.529
since she came back
on Cinco de Mayo?

23:25.987 --> 23:27.280
Yes, yes, my wife.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.533
- Nice girl, but you just missed her.
- Oh.

23:29.616 --> 23:32.119
Well, uh, could we wait here
until she gets back?

23:32.202 --> 23:35.288
Normally, I would say no,
but the ostriches

23:35.372 --> 23:37.457
have been making a hell
of a mess this past year.

23:37.541 --> 23:38.750
How's your gag reflex?

23:38.834 --> 23:41.253
Well, if you mean is my son anything

23:41.336 --> 23:45.715
like his father, well,
he's never had any complaints.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.885
<i>And Tobias explained</i>
<i>what happened next.</i>

23:49.719 --> 23:51.304
I...

23:51.388 --> 23:53.390
I got it... hey, hey... I... One...

23:53.473 --> 23:57.310
<i>Okay, well, so...</i>
<i>Tobias, also, was given a job.</i>

23:57.394 --> 23:59.688
The mail's been piling up.
You can start at Father B's.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.440
Oh, no, no, I can't go there.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.733
They held me up
at gunpoint,

24:03.817 --> 24:06.403
so you'll understand
if I pass on going back.

24:06.486 --> 24:07.779
If you're that worried,

24:07.863 --> 24:09.239
you can wear the ostrich suit.

24:09.322 --> 24:10.449
Mark always did.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.284
Oh, fun.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.369
If you pass out,
it keeps buzzards off your eyes.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.413
Double fun!

24:16.496 --> 24:18.665
Tuna fish... sandwich.

24:18.957 --> 24:22.085
So, I got a job delivering mail
for the day.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.838
Yes, I suppose I could've told you that
from up there,

24:24.921 --> 24:26.798
but I <i>am </i> glad to see you,

24:26.882 --> 24:29.176
uh, 'cause your mail certainly
has been piling up.

24:29.259 --> 24:33.388
And this is my last delivery,
so I get to put on my human clothes.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.891
Adios, muchachos.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.434
Oh, my Viagra.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.269
See, and this used to work.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.021
Since when is Viagra pink?

24:41.104 --> 24:44.065
Your mom says that the Medicare
only does the generic.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.609
You know, this is estrogen.

24:45.692 --> 24:47.444
- Really?
- How long you been taking that?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.404
Uh, two years.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.115
Two years. Isn't that about
the time that Mom was in jail

24:52.199 --> 24:53.158
and started, uh...

24:54.034 --> 24:56.495
- Forwarding my mail.
- Yeah. Why do you think she did that?

24:56.578 --> 24:59.206
Maybe she figured that
if she was gonna do hard time,

24:59.289 --> 25:00.290
I should do...

25:00.790 --> 25:01.791
Soft time. Yeah.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.085
But that doesn't explain Oscar.

25:04.169 --> 25:07.255
He has my mojo,
and all he eats is maca.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.382
And, actually,
it's this particular maca

25:09.466 --> 25:11.468
that grows all over this gully.

25:11.551 --> 25:13.386
- Down the hill from that.
- Yeah.

25:13.470 --> 25:16.306
It's from when I was running
the executive training camp.

25:16.389 --> 25:19.935
Boy, talk about guys high
on testosterone.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.145
I wish I could get
some of what they were on.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.814
Yeah. Sounds like Oscar has.

I can't believe

26:29.963 --> 26:31.006
<i>...who was behind him.</i>

26:31.548 --> 26:34.092
You have to trust me.
I don't know where Lucille 2 is.

26:34.175 --> 26:36.219
Dad, trust

26:36.303 --> 26:38.346
is a two-way street. Okay?

26:39.598 --> 26:41.016
That's Lucille 2's car.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.518
I swear to you, I didn't know

26:43.602 --> 26:45.604
You're probably not impotent, either.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.814
- We should be following her.
- Get in the Anustart,

26:47.897 --> 26:49.399
and I'll follow. Go.

26:49.482 --> 26:52.527
Follow Lucille 2.
If we get her, Buster goes free.

26:52.611 --> 26:53.945
Ooh, triple fun.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.580
<i>with Tobias at the wheel,</i>

27:03.663 --> 27:06.625

27:26.936 --> 27:28.897
The bathroom doesn't work back here,

27:28.980 --> 27:31.399
so I peed in a Wetzel bag.

Three, four, five, six, seven,

27:47.916 --> 27:49.209
- Yeah.
- Who do we sue?

27:49.292 --> 27:53.046
You, until we find out
who put down the spike strips.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.881

We're sorry

28:13.983 --> 28:16.236
Along with our 18 great-grandmothers.

28:16.319 --> 28:18.613

- Like Mitt Romney?

28:33.670 --> 28:35.755
This is America. If they don't want us
to burn signs,

28:35.839 --> 28:37.507
they shouldn't write them in Spanish.

28:37.590 --> 28:40.093
And besides,
George Bluth signed it over to us.

28:42.262 --> 28:44.931
- Oscar.
- That's a bit much. That's very nice.

28:45.014 --> 28:46.850
I wouldn't say I deserved an Oscar,
but...

28:46.933 --> 28:48.685
