00:41.200 --> 00:43.440
<i>After weeks of campaigning on the road...</i>

00:43.960 --> 00:47.080
<i>Tony Blair and his family, 
finally strolled the few hundred yards </i>

00:47.080 --> 00:50.120
<i>to the polling station, 
this election day morning.</i>

00:50.120 --> 00:52.600
<i>Amongst the Labour faithful
up and down the country...</i>

00:52.600 --> 00:55.560
<i>there is an enormous sense
of pride in Mr. Blair's achievements.</i>

00:56.080 --> 00:58.280
<i>And the confidence
that he is about to become</i>

00:58.280 --> 01:00.520
the youngest Prime Minister
this century.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.240
Have you voted yet,
Mr. Crawford?

01:02.240 --> 01:03.000
Yes, Ma'am...

01:03.680 --> 01:07.200
I was there when they opened,
first in line, at 7 o'clock...

01:07.840 --> 01:12.520
I don't mind telling you...
It wasn't for Mr. Blair.

01:13.720 --> 01:16.320
- Your not a moderniser then?
- Certainly not...

01:16.320 --> 01:20.560
We're in danger of losing too much,
that is good about this country, as it is.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.200
<i>There is a growing sense
of excitement...</i>

01:25.080 --> 01:27.600
I envy you,
being able to vote.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.360
Not the actually
ticking of the box, although...

01:30.360 --> 01:33.120
it would be nice
to experience that once.

01:34.560 --> 01:36.920
But the sheer joy of being partial.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.000
Yes...

01:38.000 --> 01:42.880
Of course one forgets that as Sovereign,
you're not entitled to vote.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.040
No...

01:44.040 --> 01:47.400
Still, you won't catch me
feeling sorry for you.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.520
You might not
be allowed to vote, Ma'am...

01:53.040 --> 01:55.480
but it is your government.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.120
Yes...

01:58.400 --> 02:00.880
I suppose that is some consolation.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.240
Good morning.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.440
- Shall I draw the curtains.
- Yes...

03:07.480 --> 03:10.720
- So, did you stay up all night?
- Yes, Ma'am.

03:11.400 --> 03:15.040
- And was it as expected?
- Yes, Ma'am.

03:15.560 --> 03:18.400
- Mr. Blair.
- By a landslide.

03:21.840 --> 03:22.800
Oh, I see...

03:25.120 --> 03:27.640
<i>They've stopped the traffic, completely...</i>

03:28.280 --> 03:31.520
<i>For Tony Blair's first
day of power, in London.</i>

03:31.520 --> 03:34.160
<i>You got the ceremonial
with tourists, the official...</i>

03:34.160 --> 03:36.800
<i>and you got
a lovely summer's day...</i>

03:36.800 --> 03:39.400
<i>Tony Blair waving to the crowds,
people waving to them there...</i>

03:39.400 --> 03:41.960
<i>I guess most of them
do know it's the...</i>

03:42.480 --> 03:44.840
<i>the Prime Minister waiting...
Lining in the streets there.</i>

03:49.000 --> 03:51.160
The Prime Minister
is on his way, Ma'am.

03:51.160 --> 03:54.320
To be, Robin..
The Prime Minister to be...

03:54.920 --> 03:56.640
I haven't asked him yet.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.560
He's a hard one to read,
isn't he?

04:01.040 --> 04:04.360
Yes... On the one hand his
background is quite establishment...

04:04.520 --> 04:07.400
father a conservative,
educated at Fettis. Where he was

04:07.400 --> 04:10.280
tutored by the same
man as the Prince of Wales.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.080
Well, we'll try not
to hold that against him.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.480
On the other, his manifesto promises
the most radical modernisation...

04:16.480 --> 04:19.480
and shake up of the
constitution in 300 years.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.800
Oh, you mean he is
going to try and modernise us?

04:21.800 --> 04:23.280
I wouldn't let it past him...

04:23.280 --> 04:26.640
he's married to a woman with known
anti-monarchist sympathies...

04:26.640 --> 04:29.440
you may remember her curtsy,
the first time you met.

04:29.480 --> 04:32.280
It could best
be described as.. shallow.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.880
I don't measure the depth of a
curtsy, Robin. I leave that to my sister.

04:37.880 --> 04:41.280
The atmosphere at Downing Street
is expected to very informal...

04:41.280 --> 04:43.360
Everyone on first name terms...

04:43.360 --> 04:45.240
at the Prime Minister's insistence.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.240
- What, as in call me Tony?
- Yes, Ma'am.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.120
Oh, I don't like that.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.800
Could we send him a protocol sheet?

05:01.280 --> 05:03.440
Funny, I'm actually rather nervous.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.200
Why? You've met her
often enough before.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.880
I know, but..
never one to one...

05:08.640 --> 05:10.040
and never as Prime Minister.

05:10.680 --> 05:14.520
Well, just remember..  you're a man
that's just been elected by
the whole nation.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.280
But she's still...

05:17.280 --> 05:19.960
you know.. The Queen.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.880
When we reach the
audience room...

05:32.880 --> 05:36.320
I will knock.
We will not wait to be called..
we shall go straight inside.

05:36.320 --> 05:39.440
Standing by the door,
we bow.. from the neck...

05:39.440 --> 05:41.200
I will introduce you...

05:41.200 --> 05:43.400
The Queen will extend her hand..
you go to her...

05:43.400 --> 05:46.520
bow again..
then shake her hand.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.400
A couple of other things...

05:49.920 --> 05:52.240
It's Ma'am as in ham...

05:52.240 --> 05:54.520
not mam as in farm.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.800
And when you're in the presence...

05:57.800 --> 06:00.040
at no point must you
show your back.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.320
- The presence?
- Yes, sir...

06:01.320 --> 06:04.760
That's what it is called, when you're
in Her Majesty's company.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.200
Would you like
to sit down, Mrs. Blair?

06:26.880 --> 06:29.080
How nice to see you
again, Mr. Blair.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.280
And congratulations.

06:32.800 --> 06:34.360
The children must be very proud?

06:34.880 --> 06:36.800
- I hope so.
- You have three, haven't you?

06:36.800 --> 06:38.360
- That's right.
- Oh, how lovely.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.040
Such a blessing.. children.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.240
Please, do sit down.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.560
Thank you.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.680
Have they shown you how to
start a nuclear war, yet?

06:55.680 --> 06:56.680
Ah, no...

06:57.160 --> 06:59.200
Oh, first thing we do.
Apparently...

06:59.680 --> 07:03.800
Then we take away your passport,
and spend the rest of the time
sending you around the world.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.440
You obviously know my job,
better than I do...

07:07.040 --> 07:09.320
Well you are my 10th
Prime Minister, Mr. Blair.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.040
My first, of course,
was Winston Churchill

07:12.040 --> 07:14.240
he sat in your chair...
in a front coat...

07:14.240 --> 07:16.200
and top hat.

07:16.680 --> 07:20.360
He was kind enough to give,
a shy young girl like me,
quite an education.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.440
I can imagine...

07:22.240 --> 07:26.720
With time, one has hopefully added
experience to that education.
And a little wisdom...

07:26.720 --> 07:30.400
better enabling us to execute
our constitutional responsibility.

07:30.960 --> 07:35.080
To advise, guide, and warn
the government of the day.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.640
Advise which I...

07:36.640 --> 07:38.560
look forward to receiving.

07:39.240 --> 07:42.040
Yes, we'll save that for
our weekly meetings.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.480
If there's nothing else, I believe we
have some business to attend to.

07:48.960 --> 07:49.880
Of course...

07:52.000 --> 07:54.920
Your Majesty, my party has
won the election...

07:54.920 --> 07:58.240
so I come now to ask your
permission to form a govern...

07:58.240 --> 08:00.520
No, Mr. Blair.
Mr. Blair, I ask the question.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.320
The duty falls upon me
as your Sovereign

08:05.320 --> 08:07.360
to invite you
to become Prime Minister...

08:07.360 --> 08:08.880
and to form a
government in my name.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.440
And if you agree,
the custom is to say yes...

08:15.960 --> 08:16.920
Yes...

08:38.159 --> 08:40.320
Mrs. Blair...
Lovely to see you again.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.600
And congratulations.
You must be very proud.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.560
- Yes...
- And exhausted, I imagine...

08:47.200 --> 08:49.280
Where will you be spending
the summer?

08:49.280 --> 08:51.040
- France.
- Oh, lovely.

08:51.040 --> 08:54.400
- You'll be at Balmoral, right?
- Yes, I can't wait.
It's a wonderful place.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.360
You know my great great
grandmother Victoria said of it...

08:57.360 --> 08:59.400
in Balmoral all seems to breed...

08:59.440 --> 09:02.280
freedom and peace and make one
forget the world and its sad turmoils.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.080
Oh, excuse me.

09:12.360 --> 09:13.600
Oh, yes of course...

09:15.360 --> 09:17.200
I'm so sorry, we're going to
have to leave it there.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.600
- Not to short was it?
15 minutes...

09:32.600 --> 09:34.320
One doesn't want to be rude.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.320
- No, no.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.480
- Thank you very much
for coming, now fuck off!

09:42.480 --> 09:44.160
- I know,
what was all that about?

09:44.160 --> 09:47.160
God knows... Diana.
Whatever it is it will be
something to do with Diana.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.120
<i>Princess Diana embroiled
in more controversy</i>

09:50.120 --> 09:52.600
<i>as she pulls out
of a meeting with MP's...</i>

09:53.000 --> 09:55.280
<i>Princess Diana moved today
to patch up</i>

09:55.280 --> 09:57.600
<i>her relations with
the former royal nanny...</i>

09:57.600 --> 09:59.760
<i>Princess Diana flew to Milan today
for the memorial service</i>

09:59.760 --> 10:01.920
<i>for the murdered
Italian fashion designer...</i>

10:01.920 --> 10:03.320
<i>Gianni Versace.</i>

10:03.320 --> 10:06.560
<i>Where tonight, another royal
controversy sparkles...</i>

10:06.560 --> 10:10.040
<i>after finding herself embroiled
in her second controversy this week...</i>

10:10.040 --> 10:11.640
<i>I am not a political figure...</i>

10:13.440 --> 10:16.120
<i>Princess Diana sailed out
into the Mediterranean...</i>

10:16.120 --> 10:18.600
<i>in one of Mr. Mohamed
al-Fayed's yachts today...</i>

10:19.440 --> 10:20.480
<i>with his son.</i>

10:21.280 --> 10:23.080
<i>A quarter of a
million pounds, for photographs</i>

10:23.080 --> 10:24.880
<i>which appear
to show the couple embracing...</i>

10:27.120 --> 10:29.960
<i>Once again,
her judgement's under scrutiny...</i>

12:22.520 --> 12:23.720
Robin Janvrin.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.000
What?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.560
I want everyone in, ASAP.

12:55.680 --> 12:56.880
Ma'am?

12:57.920 --> 12:58.680
Ma'am?

13:01.920 --> 13:04.240
Ma'am, Mr. Janvrin
is here to see you.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.440
What?

13:15.440 --> 13:16.680
Good evening, Ma'am.

13:17.280 --> 13:21.680
I'm sorry to disturb. But I just
had a call from our Embassy in Paris.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.520
- It's The Princess of Wales.
- Why?

13:24.520 --> 13:26.080
What's she done now?

13:27.920 --> 13:29.480
I see, em...

13:29.920 --> 13:31.400
Who are we speaking to then?

13:32.280 --> 13:34.720
Right, well keep me updated.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.520
It's Diana, she's been in
a car accident in Paris.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.880
Is it serious?

13:43.160 --> 13:46.480
Apparently.. Dodi Fayed is dead.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.840
<i>Let's just recap on the
details of those injuries, Maxine.</i>

13:49.840 --> 13:51.440
<i>Yes Nick, what they're saying is...</i>

13:51.440 --> 13:55.960
<i>that the Princess is in the intensive
care unit of a south-east Paris hospital.</i>

13:55.960 --> 13:58.600
<i>She has a concussion,
a broken arm, and...</i>

13:58.600 --> 14:01.560
What was she doing in Paris? I thought
she was supposed to be in London.

14:01.560 --> 14:03.320
Oh, you know what she's like.

14:05.760 --> 14:09.040
Charles, isn't this awful?

14:10.360 --> 14:12.480
What are you
going to do about the boys?

14:12.480 --> 14:14.520
Let them sleep until we know more.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.760
Yes, that's sensible.

14:16.360 --> 14:20.040
I should go to Paris. I told
my people to start organising a jet.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.880
- What, a private one?
- Yes...

14:22.880 --> 14:26.720
Isn't that precisely the sort of
extravagance they always attack us for?

14:26.720 --> 14:28.480
How else am I supposed to
get to Paris at this time of night?

14:28.480 --> 14:30.240
The airport at Aberdeen
will be closed.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.160
Charles...

14:31.960 --> 14:37.200
Use the royal flight. They keep one
plane on permanent standby...

14:37.200 --> 14:38.720
in case I should kick the bucket.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.840
No mummy! That's out of the question.
This isn't a matter of state.

14:42.480 --> 14:46.480
- What are you talking about?
- Diana is no longer a member
of the royal family.

14:46.480 --> 14:49.320
She's not a HRH.
This is a private matter.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.880
She's mother to your grandchildren.

14:51.800 --> 14:55.280
- What is happening now?
- I don't know... I can't hear...

14:55.280 --> 14:57.520
everyone's shouting.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.640
Thank's for coming in.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.240
The Ambassador,
from Paris.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.280
Good evening, sir.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.280
Yes?

15:27.920 --> 15:31.280
I have just spoken to
our Ambassador in Paris, Ma'am...

15:32.520 --> 15:34.160
I'm afraid it's not good news...

15:34.720 --> 15:35.560
No!

15:37.520 --> 15:38.760
No, no, no...

15:50.000 --> 15:53.920
<i>Diana, Princess of Wales,
has died, after a car crash in Paris.</i>

15:53.920 --> 15:55.600
<i>The french government
announced her death</i>

15:55.600 --> 15:57.280
<i>just before
5 o'clock this morning.</i>

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
What have I got on this week?

15:59.640 --> 16:02.840
You're writing your maiden
conference speeches, Prime Minister.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.480
Well, let's cancel everything else.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.000
This is going to be massive...

16:11.280 --> 16:13.560
I'd better make a statement
in the morning.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.400
Well, you'll be pleased to know I've
already started coming up with ideas.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.160
God, she's only been dead an hour...

16:19.160 --> 16:21.240
Well, would you prefer
I didn't do my job?

16:49.720 --> 16:51.320
They're going go to
go back to sleep.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.360
Try anyway...

17:04.880 --> 17:07.480
My private secretary's office
have found a travel agency

17:07.480 --> 17:10.079
open in New York
that will...

17:10.720 --> 17:14.640
sell me a flight to Paris, with
an hours stop over in Manchester.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.440
Perhaps now you might
like to consider whether it's

17:19.440 --> 17:21.760
still an extravagance
to bring back the mother...

17:21.760 --> 17:23.040
of the future King of England...

17:24.599 --> 17:26.079
In one of our planes?

17:26.079 --> 17:27.119
Alright...

17:27.119 --> 17:28.160
of course.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.560
John, I don't want the boys
to see the news and get upset...

17:44.560 --> 17:46.840
first thing in the morning,
I want the radio taken

17:46.840 --> 17:49.120
out of the bedroom, and the
television taken out of the nursery.

17:49.120 --> 17:49.920
Yes, Ma'am.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.760
Well, well, well...

17:58.800 --> 18:00.800
Yes.

18:01.800 --> 18:02.920
Are you alright?

18:05.720 --> 18:07.480
Your sister called.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.040
From Tuscany.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.280
Well, I hope you told her to
come back, cut her holiday short.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.040
I did.

18:13.040 --> 18:16.760
- I can't imagine she was pleased...
- That's putting it mildly.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.960
- What did she say?
- Something about Diana managing...

18:20.000 --> 18:22.280
to be even more annoying
dead than alive...

18:22.280 --> 18:25.560
Just make sure you never let
the boys hear you talk like that.

18:25.720 --> 18:27.920
Of course...

18:30.680 --> 18:32.600
Something to help you go down.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.280
No, I think I'll write
my diary a little longer.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.640
Fine.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.120
I'm going to bed.

19:11.160 --> 19:14.040
<i>We've heard nothing official from
the Palace yet, we still don't know</i>

19:14.040 --> 19:16.880
<i>when we're gonna get any further
statements from inside the Palace..</i>

19:17.200 --> 19:20.040
<i>or of course when the royal
family are due back.</i>

19:20.440 --> 19:24.520
That's how she will remain,
in our minds, our hearts...

19:24.520 --> 19:25.840
forever.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.240
OK?
Got it!

19:28.240 --> 19:29.240
<i>Where will you do it?</i>

19:29.640 --> 19:31.960
We'll do it at the church.
On the way in.

19:32.560 --> 19:33.720
Alright, I'll organise it.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.000
Hang on...
I wanna watch this.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.560
<i>This is not the time for
incriminations, but for sadness...</i>

19:44.560 --> 19:46.560
<i>however I would say
that I always believed</i>

19:46.600 --> 19:48.600
<i>the press would
kill her in the end...</i>

19:48.600 --> 19:50.800
<i>but not even I
could imagine they'll take</i>

19:50.800 --> 19:53.040
<i>such a direct hand in her death...</i>

19:53.040 --> 19:54.200
<i>as seems to be the case.</i>

19:55.160 --> 19:57.600
<i>It would appear that every
proprieter and editor...</i>

19:57.600 --> 20:00.040
<i>of every publication
that has payed for intrusive</i>

20:00.040 --> 20:02.480
<i>and exploitative
photographs of her...</i>

20:02.480 --> 20:04.240
<i>has blood on his hands today.</i>

20:05.560 --> 20:08.440
Not the press, mate.
You got the wrong villain.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.320
Tony...

20:10.320 --> 20:11.800
got to go...

20:12.160 --> 20:13.240
You about to speak
to The Queen?

20:13.240 --> 20:16.520
- Yeah...
- Ask her if she greased the breaks.

20:16.520 --> 20:17.400
Now, now...

20:28.160 --> 20:29.560
Hello?

20:33.160 --> 20:34.520
Right, okay...

20:36.120 --> 20:37.640
Is The Prince of Wales
with the boys?

20:37.640 --> 20:38.720
Yes, Ma'am

20:39.880 --> 20:41.760
- And he's going to Paris?
- Yes...

20:46.280 --> 20:49.440
I'm sorry to disturb, Ma'am...
Ma'am...

20:50.040 --> 20:53.560
but I have the Prime Minister for you,
from his constituency.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.280
Lucky you..

20:56.280 --> 20:59.160
Thank you, Robin.
I'll take it in the study.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.000
- Good morning, Your Majesty.
- Prime Minister.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.960
May I say right away,
how very sorry I am...

21:15.760 --> 21:17.480
and that the thoughts
and prayers of my family

21:17.480 --> 21:19.160
are with you
at this terrible time.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.880
And with the Princes,
in particular.

21:21.880 --> 21:22.560
Thank you.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.320
<i>Is it your intention to make
some kind of appearance?</i>

21:26.520 --> 21:28.800
<i>Or statement?</i>

21:29.320 --> 21:31.440
No, no!
Certainly not.

21:32.920 --> 21:35.360
No member of the royal family
will speak publicly about this.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.800
This is a private matter.

21:37.800 --> 21:41.400
We would all appreciate it,
if it could be respected as such.

21:41.400 --> 21:42.240
I see.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.760
I don't suppose anyone has had
time to think about the funeral, yet?

21:48.880 --> 21:51.760
We've spoken with the
Spencer family, and it is their wish...

21:51.760 --> 21:54.640
it is their expressed wish,
that this should be a private funeral.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.640
with a memorial service to follow,
in a month or so.

21:57.640 --> 21:58.760
Right...

21:58.760 --> 22:01.960
And given that Diana was
no longer a member of the royal family...

22:01.960 --> 22:04.560
we have no other choice,
but to respect their wishes.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.160
I see...

22:06.160 --> 22:11.640
<i>you don't feel that in view
of her high profile popularity...</i>

22:12.920 --> 22:16.800
it might be an idea to pay
tribute to her life and achievements?

22:17.440 --> 22:20.920
Or even just to her as a mother?

22:20.920 --> 22:23.360
Well, as I said,
it's her family's wish...

22:24.000 --> 22:26.640
And the public, Ma'am?
The British people...

22:27.600 --> 22:31.760
<i>you don't think a private funeral
might be denying them a chance...</i>

22:31.760 --> 22:32.480
A chance to what?

22:34.520 --> 22:36.520
<i>To share in the grief.</i>

22:37.760 --> 22:41.440
This is a family funeral, Mr. Blair,
not a fairground attraction.

22:42.240 --> 22:44.120
I think The Princess has
already paid a high enough price...

22:44.120 --> 22:46.000
for exposure to the press...

22:46.000 --> 22:46.840
<i>don't you?</i>

22:48.200 --> 22:50.680
Now, if there's nothing else,
I must get on.

22:50.680 --> 22:52.400
The children have to be looked after.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.440
Of course...
well, goodbye Your Majes...

23:04.960 --> 23:06.920
Her instinct is to do nothing.

23:07.520 --> 23:11.280
Say nothing.. and
give her a private funeral.

23:11.280 --> 23:12.640
Are you surprised?

23:12.640 --> 23:14.120
She hated her guts.

23:14.520 --> 23:15.680
Well, I think it's a mistake...

23:16.800 --> 23:19.880
They screwed up her life, let's
hope they don't screw up her death.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.280
Where can I find a black tie?

23:23.000 --> 23:24.440
Oh, the chaplain called.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.000
He wanted to know,
whether we should make any

23:26.000 --> 23:27.520
changes in the service..
any...

23:27.520 --> 23:29.960
special mention of Diana.

23:29.960 --> 23:31.680
What did you say?

23:31.680 --> 23:33.440
Well, I told him
not to change a thing.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.920
Quite right...

23:35.440 --> 23:38.760
I think the less attention one
draws to it, the better.

23:38.760 --> 23:40.080
- For the boys.
- Yes...

23:40.840 --> 23:42.800
But I think maybe we should find
some company for them...

23:42.800 --> 23:44.760
Some young people.

23:44.760 --> 23:47.080
I'll take them for a long walk,
this afternoon.. up Craggie Head.

23:47.080 --> 23:50.160
Yes, but no guns Phillip..
it is Sunday.

23:53.040 --> 23:56.880
And we're going... in fact...
I believe...

23:57.240 --> 23:59.680
to Sedgefield, the
Prime Minister's constituency...

23:59.680 --> 24:02.120
where he is about
to make a statement...

24:02.120 --> 24:07.680
yes the Prime Minister coming
now, with his wife Cherie...

24:09.720 --> 24:12.560
He's on. Alastair, he's on.
Come on!

24:14.840 --> 24:18.400
...as her own life was often,
sadly touched by tradegy...

24:19.160 --> 24:23.240
she touched the lives,
of so many others in...

24:25.200 --> 24:26.720
in Britain, throughout the world...

24:27.360 --> 24:28.960
with joy...

24:29.520 --> 24:30.960
and with comfort.

24:32.440 --> 24:35.040
The people, everywhere...

24:35.520 --> 24:37.520
not just here in Britain,
everywhere...

24:38.400 --> 24:40.840
they kept faith,
with Princess Diana.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.240
They liked her, they loved her...

24:45.200 --> 24:48.040
they regarded her,
as one of the people...

24:49.560 --> 24:52.400
she was the people's Princess.

24:56.360 --> 24:59.440
And that's how she will stay...

24:59.440 --> 25:01.040
how she will remain.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.480
In our hearts...

25:04.480 --> 25:05.360
and in our memories...

25:06.560 --> 25:07.640
forever.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.720
A little over the top,
don't you think?

25:14.960 --> 25:16.000
<i>The people of Britain, he said...</i>

25:16.000 --> 25:19.120
<i>kept faith with Princess Diana...</i>

25:19.640 --> 25:23.360
<i>they loved her..
she was the people's Princess.</i>

25:32.200 --> 25:34.800
- Did we remember the Royal Standard?
- Yes, Sir.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.320
- And flowers?
- Yes, Sir.

25:36.320 --> 25:38.440
Good, 'cause if we leave it
to the rural undertakers...

25:38.440 --> 25:40.560
they'll bring her
back in a wooden crypt.

26:31.560 --> 26:32.360
Hello?

26:32.360 --> 26:34.680
<i>This is Lord Airlie, may I speak
with the Prime Minister, please?</i>

26:34.680 --> 26:36.280
One moment, please.

26:36.280 --> 26:38.760
Lord Airlie..
The Lord Chamberlain

26:38.760 --> 26:41.240
in charge of the funeral..
you're meeting him at the airport.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.040
Lord Airlie.

26:44.480 --> 26:46.720
Good afternoon, Prime Minister,
it's my job to organise

26:46.720 --> 26:48.920
all the ceremonial events.

26:49.720 --> 26:53.160
There is simply no precedent
for the funeral of an ex-HRH.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.480
Perhaps we shall plan
for any contingency.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.280
Yes, I propose a meeting
at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning

26:58.280 --> 27:00.040
at Buckingham Palace...

27:00.160 --> 27:03.000
<i>officals from all three Palaces,
representatives from the</i>

27:03.000 --> 27:05.880
<i>Spencer family,
the emergency services...</i>

27:06.280 --> 27:08.080
would you send some of your people?

27:08.080 --> 27:09.520
Absolutely, of course.

27:13.560 --> 27:17.480
Precedent!?
Where do they find these people?

27:40.880 --> 27:42.080
Prime Minister...

27:42.760 --> 27:44.760
I'm so sorry, Sir.
If there's anything I..

27:44.760 --> 27:46.800
or my government, can do...

27:46.800 --> 27:51.520
They stood up, as we drove past,
in cafés, in restaurants...

27:51.560 --> 27:55.760
removed their hats, this was Paris,
one of the busiest cities in the world...

27:55.760 --> 27:58.560
and you could hear a pin drop.
- I imagine it will be the same here.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.560
The Palace would still prefer
to see this as a private funeral.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.520
What are your feelings on that?

28:03.080 --> 28:04.040
I...

28:07.320 --> 28:10.080
I think that will present us
with difficulties.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.920
So do I...

28:12.560 --> 28:15.280
My mother, The Queen...

28:15.280 --> 28:19.560
comes from a generation of best
equipped... she grew up in the war...

28:19.560 --> 28:22.440
I think.. what we need..
what this country needs...

28:23.320 --> 28:26.600
is a more modern perspective,
if you follow...

28:26.600 --> 28:30.520
- Balmoral is...
- I think I understand...

28:35.680 --> 28:37.680
<i>An aircraft of the Queen's flight...</i>

28:37.680 --> 28:39.560
<i>brought The Princess'
body home this evening...</i>

28:39.560 --> 28:41.480
<i>where the Prime Minister,
Tony Blair, had gathered with</i>

28:41.480 --> 28:43.440
<i>members of his government.</i>

28:44.080 --> 28:46.480
<i>A single black hearse crossed the tarmac...</i>

28:47.120 --> 28:50.360
<i>and a Royal Air Force guard
of honour, moved slowly forward.</i>

28:50.360 --> 28:52.360
Has anyone heard from
the Spencer's yet?

28:52.360 --> 28:54.360
Have they made up their minds
when the funeral will be?

28:56.240 --> 28:59.000
Well I don't know.
Nobody tells me anything.

28:59.040 --> 29:02.520
<i>President Clinton was with his wife,
when he heard the news last night.</i>

29:02.520 --> 29:03.600
<i>We liked her very much...</i>

29:03.600 --> 29:06.800
<i>we admired her work for children...</i>

29:06.800 --> 29:11.440
<i>for people with AIDS, for the cause
of ending the scour of landmines...</i>

29:11.440 --> 29:14.520
On our walk today one of the
ghillies said he'd seen a large stag

29:14.520 --> 29:16.000
up Craggie Head...

29:17.680 --> 29:19.840
He reckoned, 14 pointer.

29:21.160 --> 29:24.280
We haven't had one as big as
that on the estate, for years...

29:24.800 --> 29:27.400
No, quite...

29:31.400 --> 29:34.640
Anyway... I thought it might
be a good distraction...

29:35.360 --> 29:36.320
for the boys.

29:36.320 --> 29:38.560
What.. stalking?

29:38.560 --> 29:40.800
You don't think that's
a bit soon, do you?

29:40.800 --> 29:43.040
I think anything that gets
them outside, is a good idea.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.560
<i>...she became an
increasingly unhappy figure.</i>

29:50.560 --> 29:53.120
<i>The couple divorced
in August of last year.</i>

29:57.200 --> 30:00.400
<i>It was the love story that
brought crowds into the streets...</i>

30:00.400 --> 30:03.440
<i>they came to see The Queen,
of course, and The Prince...</i>

30:03.440 --> 30:05.920
<i>but most of all,
they came to see Diana.</i>

30:07.000 --> 30:08.520
I'm going to bed.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.840
I'll ring the Lord Chamberlain's office.
Say we are going to send

30:31.840 --> 30:34.480
representatives for the meeting
tomorrow morning, 10 o'clock.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.400
Thank you, Stephen.

30:48.120 --> 30:50.560
She gave us so much.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.480
Why couldn't we have
given her a little something...

30:52.480 --> 30:54.400
and left her alone?

30:55.600 --> 30:58.520
It just hurts me so much.

30:58.520 --> 31:01.400
I've never experienced
anything like this. I can't...

31:01.400 --> 31:04.280
I keep waiting to
wake up, like it's a bad dream.

31:17.760 --> 31:20.640
Right, it's 10 o'clock.
Let's get started, shall we?

31:20.640 --> 31:22.680
And thank you all for coming,
at such short notice.

31:23.960 --> 31:28.320
I think we all agree that this is
an extraordinarily sensitive occation...

31:28.320 --> 31:29.920
which presents us
with tremendous challenges.

31:30.720 --> 31:33.640
Modestically, constitutionally...

31:33.640 --> 31:39.440
practically, diplomatically
and procedurally.

31:39.960 --> 31:41.720
Christ...

31:47.360 --> 31:49.440
After 18 years of opposition...

31:49.440 --> 31:51.600
I am proud to stand before you,
as the new Prime Minister

31:51.600 --> 31:52.560
of our country...

31:52.560 --> 31:54.240
Labour, Prime Minister.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.920
I want to set an ambitious
course to modernise this country...

31:58.920 --> 32:01.640
to breed new life
in to old institutions.

32:01.640 --> 32:05.040
To make privileged something for
the many... not the few...

32:05.040 --> 32:07.240
Flippin' heck...
You think the royals are nutters?

32:07.240 --> 32:09.400
You should meet their flunkies...

32:09.400 --> 32:10.880
Two and a half hours of
whether she should be carried

32:10.880 --> 32:12.600
in a hearse or a gun carriage.

32:13.160 --> 32:16.040
Anyway, you got raves in the press.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.000
This lot calls you the
nation's mourner-in-chief

32:18.000 --> 32:19.840
This lot says
you're the only person who's

32:19.840 --> 32:21.640
correctly judged,
the mood of the country.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.720
Even The Mail is impressed.

32:25.920 --> 32:28.360
The people's Princess, mate...
you owe me.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.800
Gordon for you...

32:32.800 --> 32:33.800
Tell him to hang on.

32:34.280 --> 32:35.080
Alastair...

32:36.960 --> 32:39.320
So they've come to their senses?
Is it going to be a public funeral?

32:39.320 --> 32:41.440
Yeah, Saturday..
It's a whopper!

32:41.480 --> 32:42.920
- The Abbey, the works...
- Great.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.840
Has anyone told the queen yet?

32:45.840 --> 32:48.160
I don't know. No doubt
some flunkey will be dispatched.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.480
Grovelling on all fours.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.920
Do you think it's wise for
the boys to go stalking so soon?

33:02.920 --> 33:05.800
Anything that gets them into
the fresh air, is a good thing.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.480
Maybe they shouldn't take their guns?
I mean, if a photographer

33:08.480 --> 33:11.120
were to see them, it might send
out the wrong signal?

33:11.520 --> 33:13.760
If there is
a photographer out there...

33:14.440 --> 33:16.320
he could be
the first kill of the day.

33:19.680 --> 33:22.520
I see Mr. Fayed was buried last night...

33:23.680 --> 33:26.480
At midnight.
No cameras, no fuss.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.840
Very dignified.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.200
Why do they do that?
Why do they bury their bodies

33:32.200 --> 33:34.000
so soon after their death?

33:34.760 --> 33:36.920
Islamic tradition...

33:36.920 --> 33:38.840
something to do with the heat.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.720
It stops the body decomposing

33:43.240 --> 33:44.160
Yes, come in!

33:46.800 --> 33:49.280
- Good morning, Ma'am... Ma'am.
- Yes, Robin...

33:49.280 --> 33:50.440
what can we do for you?

33:52.320 --> 33:56.280
Ma'am. There was a meeting at
the Palace, this morning...

33:56.280 --> 33:58.440
About the funeral arrangements, yes...

33:58.440 --> 34:02.880
The Lord Chamberlain faxed over
these plans for you to consider.

34:05.240 --> 34:07.760
There is now
general agreement, Ma'am...

34:08.760 --> 34:12.000
that a public funeral,
would be more appropriate.

34:16.639 --> 34:17.639
I see...

34:19.320 --> 34:22.360
And what form will this funeral take?

34:22.920 --> 34:25.239
At the moment they're suggesting...

34:25.880 --> 34:28.600
and of course, these are early days...

34:28.600 --> 34:30.840
basing it on Taye Bridge.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.080
- Taye Bridge?
- What?

34:33.719 --> 34:37.120
But Taye Bridge is
to go down for my funeral.

34:37.600 --> 34:38.480
Indeed, Ma'am.

34:39.080 --> 34:42.239
But it would be
for practical reasons only...

34:43.000 --> 34:46.600
it's the only one which
has been... rehearsed.

34:46.960 --> 34:49.760
The only one that could be
put together, in time...

34:50.920 --> 34:54.120
But I supervised
those plans myself...

34:54.199 --> 34:55.159
Indeed...

34:55.159 --> 34:57.560
And the Lord Chamberlain
was at pains to stress

34:57.560 --> 34:59.400
that the spirit of the occasion

34:59.400 --> 35:01.800
will be quite different,
for example...

35:01.800 --> 35:05.000
the suggestion is that
instead of 400 soldiers...

35:05.080 --> 35:10.080
400 representatives of the Princess'
various charitys march behind...

35:10.240 --> 35:11.400
the coffin.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.160
And instead of
foreign heads of state...

35:15.160 --> 35:16.880
and crown heads
of Europe...

35:16.880 --> 35:18.640
the guests would include...

35:18.640 --> 35:22.440
a sprinkling of actors
of stage and screen...

35:22.440 --> 35:23.720
fashion designers...

35:23.720 --> 35:28.480
and other... celebrities.
- Celebrities?

35:35.760 --> 35:38.360
Was there anything else?

35:39.080 --> 35:40.960
No, Ma'am.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.360
Oh, yes,
one other thing...

35:46.160 --> 35:49.200
the police commisioner was
keen that you consider...

35:49.200 --> 35:51.880
the idea of a condolence book.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.840
It would give the growing crowds

35:54.840 --> 35:57.480
something to do..
make marshaling them easier.

35:57.480 --> 35:58.720
Oh, yes,
yes of course...

36:00.640 --> 36:04.600
- Oh, and the flowers...
- What flowers?

36:05.160 --> 36:08.040
The flowers outside
Buckingham Palace... At the moment

36:08.040 --> 36:10.920
they're blocking the path
through the Main Gate..

36:10.920 --> 36:12.440
and will make things difficult

36:12.440 --> 36:14.200
for the changing of the guards.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.120
Oh, fine.
Just move them away.

36:16.240 --> 36:18.520
Actually, the
Lord Chamberlain was

36:18.520 --> 36:20.760
wondering whether we
shouldn't leave the flowers...

36:20.760 --> 36:23.600
and send the guards
through the North Gate

36:24.480 --> 36:25.880
Oh, yes,
yes of course.

36:26.640 --> 36:28.240
Yes,
that's quite right.

36:36.880 --> 36:38.080
Stephen Lamport on one.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.520
- Who?
- The Prince of Wales' private secretary.

36:41.560 --> 36:43.800
- Balmoral.
- He says it's urgent.

36:48.880 --> 36:51.440
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Prime Minister.

36:52.840 --> 36:54.760
The Prince of Wales has asked me
to thank you again

36:54.760 --> 36:56.680
for your kind words yesterday.

36:56.920 --> 36:57.720
Not at all.

36:58.840 --> 37:01.480
The Prince feels that...
you and he...

37:02.280 --> 37:06.120
are both modern men,
of similar mind...

37:06.720 --> 37:09.760
who could work well together,
at this difficult time.

37:10.520 --> 37:13.760
Ah, well..
please thank His Highness

37:13.760 --> 37:16.640
and assure him
he can count on my full support.

37:17.720 --> 37:18.800
At all times.

37:21.720 --> 37:24.160
- Was that it?
- Yes...

37:25.000 --> 37:26.280
Goodbye.

37:32.920 --> 37:34.720
Bizzare.

37:36.080 --> 37:38.200
- Why is Charles doing this?
- What?

37:38.200 --> 37:39.880
Creeping up to me like this.

37:39.880 --> 37:42.040
Banging on about being modern.

37:42.040 --> 37:45.280
He did it at the airport, when he
asked me to deal with his mother.

37:45.280 --> 37:48.720
Because he knows that if the Queen
continous to get it wrong over Diana...

37:48.720 --> 37:50.920
then the royals become
public enemy number one.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.040
And he's terrified of
being shot, apparently.

37:54.040 --> 37:54.960
Who, Charles?

37:54.960 --> 37:57.480
His people have already been on
to us.. to ask for extra protection.

37:57.480 --> 38:00.040
He probably thinks that if
he seems to be on our side...

38:00.040 --> 38:02.600
then that would leave
The Queen in the firing line.

38:02.600 --> 38:05.880
What.. so it's okay for his mother
to take the bullet, and not him...

38:06.920 --> 38:08.680
What a family!

38:11.480 --> 38:13.640
- Wait, where are they?
- They're up at Craggie Head.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.920
I'll come with you.
Do you want me to drive?

38:20.920 --> 38:22.440
No, certainly not.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.320
I thought you were going
to get a new one of these?

38:31.320 --> 38:33.200
What for.. it's perfectly alright.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.960
I was thinking last night what Diana
might have done...

38:40.960 --> 38:43.560
had it been me
that died in the tunnel in Paris.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.320
She would certainly
have taken the boys to Paris.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.360
I rather regret
not doing that know.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.440
What, and expose them to the media?

38:51.440 --> 38:53.120
that would have
been a dreadful thing to do.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.800
No, they're much better of here...

38:54.800 --> 38:56.040
it's private, they're protected.

38:56.640 --> 39:00.000
Whatever else you may have thought
of Diana, she was a wonderful mother.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.560
She adored those boys,
and never let them forget it.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.720
Always warm, and physical...

39:06.240 --> 39:07.920
never afraid to show her feelings...

39:07.920 --> 39:10.080
Especially whenever
a photographer was in sight.

39:10.520 --> 39:13.200
She may have encouraged all that,
but still...

39:13.200 --> 39:16.240
that was always the
extraordinary thing about her...

39:16.960 --> 39:19.640
her weaknessess,
and transgressions...

39:19.640 --> 39:21.200
only made the public love her more.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.840
And ours only make them hate us.
Why is that?

39:23.840 --> 39:25.080
Why do they hate us so much?

39:25.080 --> 39:26.040
- Not us, dear...
- What?

39:29.040 --> 39:32.280
Yesterday, when we
brought the coffin back...

39:32.920 --> 39:35.040
there was a noise, a bang,
I don't mind telling you...

39:35.040 --> 39:35.920
I thought it was a gun.

39:35.920 --> 39:38.120
I thought someone
had taken a shot at me.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.040
I think I'm going to walk back.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.240
I don't feel like stalking.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.600
- Oh, are you sure?
- I'll take the dogs.

39:48.360 --> 39:49.800
Walkies? yes...

40:08.320 --> 40:10.080
Come on...

40:56.320 --> 40:58.560
<i>Do you think...
you'll ever be Queen?</i>

41:01.480 --> 41:03.600
<i>No I don't, no.</i>

41:03.600 --> 41:04.960
<i>Why do you think that?</i>

41:07.320 --> 41:11.120
<i>I like to be a Queen of people's
hearts, in people's hearts.</i>

41:11.920 --> 41:14.920
<i>But I don't see myself as
being Queen of this country.</i>

41:15.600 --> 41:18.280
<i>I don't think many people
would want me to be Queen...</i>

41:18.280 --> 41:20.760
<i>Actually, when
I say many people, I mean</i>

41:20.760 --> 41:22.520
<i>the establishment
that I married into.</i>

41:22.520 --> 41:27.000
<i>Because they've decided...
that I'm a non-starter.</i>

41:29.440 --> 41:31.920
Charles and I
had a talk in the car today.

41:33.960 --> 41:37.320
He was good enough to share with me,
his thoughts on motherhood.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.080
What did he say?

41:39.600 --> 41:41.800
How wonderful Diana was...

41:41.800 --> 41:43.720
That's changing his tune.

41:43.760 --> 41:44.880
...and natural.

41:47.880 --> 41:51.040
<i>They see me as
a threat of some kind.</i>

41:51.400 --> 41:52.800
Oh, for Gods sake!

41:54.480 --> 41:57.800
Maybe he's got a point...
Maybe we are partly to blame...

41:59.080 --> 42:01.120
Oh, I can't watch this.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.640
No, no wait..
please, no.. leave it!

42:11.600 --> 42:13.720
We encouraged the match.

42:15.360 --> 42:19.520
We signed of on it, both of us.
You were very enthusiastic, remember?

42:19.520 --> 42:20.760
She was a nice girl.

42:21.400 --> 42:22.280
Then...

42:24.000 --> 42:26.080
And I was sure he'd give
the other one up...

42:26.080 --> 42:28.920
or at least make sure
his wife toed the line.

42:29.680 --> 42:31.920
Isn't that what everyone does?

42:32.640 --> 42:34.000
Is it?

42:37.800 --> 42:40.040
<i>Well, there were three of us,
in this marriage...</i>

42:40.040 --> 42:41.560
<i>so it was a bit crowded.</i>

42:44.560 --> 42:46.160
I can't bear it anymore..

42:46.160 --> 42:48.320
If you're watching,
I'll sleep next door.

42:48.320 --> 42:49.680
Early start tomorrow.

42:49.680 --> 42:51.240
Any luck with your stag?

42:51.680 --> 42:55.360
No, but close.. A couple of
hundred yards at one point.

42:55.360 --> 42:57.440
One of the boys
even got a shot off.

42:59.960 --> 43:01.880
We'll get him tomorrow.

43:03.240 --> 43:04.200
See you in the morning.

43:06.520 --> 43:07.240
Not to worry.

43:07.760 --> 43:08.680
Night night.

43:14.840 --> 43:18.640
<i>Charles continued to love a woman
he'd fallen for years before...</i>

43:35.040 --> 43:37.800
The good news is that the
Palace has agreed to videoscreens

43:37.800 --> 43:38.960
in the Royal Parks...

43:38.960 --> 43:40.680
- And the bad news?
- Crash barriers...

43:40.680 --> 43:42.560
- What about them?
- Well they're now predicting...

43:42.560 --> 43:44.160
more than two million people
in the center of London.

43:44.160 --> 43:46.480
There aren't enough barriers
to line the route.

43:46.480 --> 43:49.120
So we've gone tapping into
the french for theirs.

43:49.800 --> 43:51.400
And there's something else
I think you should see...

43:53.000 --> 43:55.040
- Can we run that piece again?
- Of course.

43:55.640 --> 43:56.840
You're gonna love this...

43:57.640 --> 43:59.560
<i>I don't like their behaviour..
very disgraceful.</i>

43:59.560 --> 44:00.440
<i>What do you think madam?</i>

44:01.240 --> 44:04.160
<i>I think it's disgusting, that they
have not appeared or said a word...</i>

44:04.160 --> 44:06.200
<i>relating to all this.</i>

44:06.200 --> 44:08.400
- Look, I know all this.
- Wait for it..

44:09.920 --> 44:12.320
<i>- Not to have a flag up, I think it's
a disgrace on the whole royal family.</i>

44:12.320 --> 44:14.760
<i>- OK, The Queen's not
in residence today...</i>

44:14.760 --> 44:16.080
<i>but where the hell is the flag?</i>

44:16.080 --> 44:18.960
<i>You see what I'm saying
about the establishment?</i>

44:19.480 --> 44:23.280
Don't tell me there isn't a flag flying
at half mast over Buckingham Palace..

44:24.200 --> 44:27.120
<i>To people she was their king and
queen, when them two were together</i>

44:27.120 --> 44:28.600
<i>it was a fairytale come true...</i>

44:29.200 --> 44:32.000
Will someone please save
these people from themselves.

44:32.840 --> 44:34.800
Fine, I'll call Balmoral.

44:34.800 --> 44:37.960
Beause as Prime Minister, I really
got nothing better to do.

44:37.960 --> 44:39.640
Come on dogs, come on...

44:49.080 --> 44:51.800
- Is the firelights alright?
- A bit damp.

44:53.520 --> 44:56.920
Well I brought some stew..
just in case.

44:56.920 --> 44:58.880
I think it's lamb.. we could
always have that cold.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.240
No, we'll be alright.

45:01.840 --> 45:02.560
Stay.

45:05.080 --> 45:10.320
Robin had a call from the Prime Minister,
who expressed his concern...

45:10.320 --> 45:12.000
About what?

45:12.800 --> 45:15.080
About the flag
above Buckingham Palace.

45:15.080 --> 45:18.280
He thinks it should
be flying at half mast.

45:18.280 --> 45:21.600
I hope Robin told him there
isn't a flag above Buckingham Palace.

45:22.480 --> 45:24.680
There's the Royal Standard,
which flies for one reason only...

45:24.720 --> 45:26.680
to denote the presence
of the monarch.

45:26.680 --> 45:31.320
Since you're here, the flag pole
is bare, which is as it should be.

45:31.320 --> 45:34.160
Isn't it possible, that for some people...

45:34.160 --> 45:37.360
the Royal Standard,
is just a flag...

45:38.600 --> 45:42.200
And that the flag pole being bare,
sends out the wrong signal..

45:42.200 --> 45:43.600
No, that's not the point.

45:43.600 --> 45:46.240
The point is, it's
more than 400 years old.

45:46.240 --> 45:48.880
It hasn't been
lowered for anyone.

45:49.160 --> 45:52.400
Your grandfather didn't get the
flag at half mast, when he died.

45:53.400 --> 45:57.240
If you're mother died tomorrow,
she wouldn't either.

45:57.240 --> 46:01.200
Yes, granny. But sometimes, in a
situation like this, one has to be flexible.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.640
It is just a flag.

46:03.640 --> 46:07.160
What about the Union Jack?
Was Mr. Blair's next suggestion..

46:08.120 --> 46:09.360
- For heavens sake?
- The next thing he'll be suggesting...

46:09.360 --> 46:11.600
you change your name
to Hilda and mine to Hector.

46:11.600 --> 46:14.080
Who does he think he's
talking to?

46:14.880 --> 46:16.600
You're the Sovereign, the
Head of State...

46:16.600 --> 46:18.400
you don't get dictated to.

46:19.040 --> 46:21.200
You've conceded the idea
of a public funeral...

46:21.200 --> 46:24.160
you've opened up the parks,
that's enough.

46:25.080 --> 46:26.280
Shh... the boys..

46:27.000 --> 46:30.400
You wait.. In 48 hours,
this will all have calmed down.

47:01.840 --> 47:03.560
Where once it seemed comforting...

47:04.160 --> 47:06.280
for the first time
my parents can see...

47:06.280 --> 47:07.800
what it's been like for me
all these years...

47:07.800 --> 47:09.920
being up against her popularity.

47:09.920 --> 47:13.520
But they're still making the mistake
of thinking that the Diana they knew...

47:13.520 --> 47:15.480
from living and dealing with her...

47:15.480 --> 47:17.640
will eventually be the one
seen by the public.. but it won't!

47:18.920 --> 47:24.440
The two Dianas, the public's and ours,
bear no relation to one another, at all..

47:26.840 --> 47:29.440
I've been thinking,
the flag of St. George's is

47:29.440 --> 47:31.640
at half mast over High Grove?
- Yes, sir.

47:31.920 --> 47:34.240
Well, make sure we get a picture
of that in the papers, will you?

47:34.240 --> 47:36.560
I'll get on to the tabloids,
call in a few favours.

47:36.560 --> 47:39.760
What about a statement
of gratitude, to the crowds?

47:40.840 --> 47:44.240
something heartfelt,
from myself and the boys...

47:44.240 --> 47:46.320
thanking people
for all the flowers...

47:46.320 --> 47:48.080
and so on.
- Right.

47:48.280 --> 47:51.160
<i>Di was wonderful, because she
stood up to the establishment...</i>

47:51.160 --> 47:52.760
<i>we have no-one doing that now...</i>

47:52.760 --> 47:55.200
<i>she said you're detached,
elitist people...</i>

47:55.200 --> 47:58.240
<i>we are paying million of
pounds to be better than us...</i>

47:58.240 --> 48:00.400
<i>and you gotta get out
there amongst the people...</i>

48:00.400 --> 48:04.000
<i>we have a wonderful new
Prime Minister in England, Tony Blair...</i>

48:04.000 --> 48:07.280
<i>a compassionate young man,
who after 18 years...</i>

48:07.280 --> 48:09.200
<i>of establishment toil and row...</i>

48:09.200 --> 48:12.600
<i>is such a breath of fresh air,
and I feel he will...</i>

48:12.600 --> 48:14.600
<i>do something about this
in England..</i>

48:14.680 --> 48:16.200
Do you think this will
be the first stirings of...

48:16.200 --> 48:17.080
Of what?

48:17.080 --> 48:19.520
I don't know..
something more interesting...

48:19.560 --> 48:23.600
Maybe this time people will finally have
seen them for what they actually are.

48:24.280 --> 48:25.600
Which is?

48:25.600 --> 48:27.400
A bunch of freeloading...

48:27.400 --> 48:28.880
emotionally retarded...

48:28.880 --> 48:30.600
nutters!

48:32.000 --> 48:34.520
- That's just absurd.
- Why?

48:34.520 --> 48:37.080
They have a ludicrous cocoon
of privilege and wealth...

48:37.080 --> 48:39.040
and they don't pay tax.
- Yes they do.

48:39.040 --> 48:39.880
Not on all their income.

48:39.920 --> 48:41.760
The Queen alone costs us,
what.. 30.. 40 million a year?

48:41.760 --> 48:44.520
Look.. If you wanna have
a serious conversation...

48:44.520 --> 48:45.720
- I do..
- About the constitution.

48:45.720 --> 48:48.920
- We don't have one.
- About ways in which
we as a government...

48:48.920 --> 48:51.760
could phase out hereditary
privileges, then fine...

48:51.760 --> 48:53.480
If you're gonna leave
will you take the plates?

48:53.480 --> 48:56.640
But, you know, spare me the
whole off with their heads thing.

48:56.640 --> 48:57.240
Why?

48:57.240 --> 48:58.720
Because it insults your intelligence.

48:59.800 --> 49:01.760
<i>The Queen can not
be expected to change...</i>

49:01.760 --> 49:05.120
It's unimaginable this
country being a republic.

49:06.040 --> 49:07.680
- Certainly in her lifetime.
- Why?

49:07.680 --> 49:10.160
Because no-one would wear it...

49:10.160 --> 49:11.840
No-one wants it.

49:12.440 --> 49:15.800
It's just.. daft.

49:17.280 --> 49:18.600
It's not a mother thing, is it?

49:19.280 --> 49:20.040
What?

49:20.560 --> 49:23.680
Well, if she were alive now...

49:23.680 --> 49:25.640
your mother would
be exactly the same age.

49:26.440 --> 49:28.960
I mean.. you always say
how stoical she was...

49:28.960 --> 49:30.920
old-fashioned, uncomplained...

49:30.920 --> 49:32.160
lived through the war..

49:32.200 --> 49:33.960
Oh, come on..
who does that sound like?

49:33.960 --> 49:35.200
I'm gonna go
do the washing-up.

49:52.880 --> 49:54.440
That's the stalking party off...

49:54.920 --> 49:56.200
Right...

49:56.640 --> 49:58.880
I'd better have
a look at those papers.

49:59.360 --> 50:03.520
"Show us there's a heart, in the
house of Windsor", says The Sun.

50:04.120 --> 50:07.040
"It's proof the royals are
not like us", The Mirror.

50:07.720 --> 50:10.760
"Time to change the old guard
at Buckingham Palace", Express.

50:13.120 --> 50:16.280
"One can't help wondering
who's advise they're taking...

50:16.320 --> 50:18.280
for it's clearly
the wrong advise"..

50:19.640 --> 50:22.520
I'll try not to take that personally.

50:23.080 --> 50:26.240
People have been yearning
for a change in this country...

50:26.240 --> 50:29.480
good.. the result is a quiet
revolution now taking place...

50:29.520 --> 50:32.360
lead by the real modernisers..
the British people.

50:32.360 --> 50:34.760
Revolution?
Who wrote this?

50:36.280 --> 50:38.240
Where does this come from?

50:38.240 --> 50:39.960
Where does it come from?

50:39.960 --> 50:42.160
You just won a
huge landslide majority.

50:42.160 --> 50:43.520
People wanna see a change.

50:44.880 --> 50:46.760
Why, what did you
think it meant?

50:50.960 --> 50:53.280
Hurry up dear,
your tea is getting cold.

50:53.280 --> 50:53.960
Is that it?

50:54.000 --> 50:56.640
Yes Ma'am, just the
letter of condolence...

50:56.640 --> 50:58.760
to the widow of
the Ambassador to Brasil.

51:00.640 --> 51:02.280
Good, thank you.

51:05.200 --> 51:07.080
Tea!

51:08.360 --> 51:12.520
Mr. Janvrin... The Prime Minister
wishes to speak to Her Majesty.

51:17.240 --> 51:19.000
Ma'am...

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
Apparently the Prime Minister
is on the phone, for you..

51:22.000 --> 51:24.040
Tell him to call back.

51:26.200 --> 51:27.880
No, no. It's alright.
I'll take it.

51:36.760 --> 51:38.240
Prime Minister...

51:38.240 --> 51:39.520
Good morning, Your Majesty...

51:39.520 --> 51:42.520
sorry to disturb..
but I was just wondering

51:42.520 --> 51:44.720
whether you'd seen
any of today's papers?

51:45.960 --> 51:48.000
We've managed to
look at one or two...

51:48.960 --> 51:50.760
<i>In which case my...</i>

51:51.200 --> 51:52.240
<i>next question would be...</i>

51:52.240 --> 51:57.520
<i>whether you felt some kind of
response, might be necessary?</i>

51:59.280 --> 52:03.360
No... I believe a few,
over eager editors...

52:03.360 --> 52:05.000
are doing their best
to sell newspapers...

52:05.120 --> 52:07.480
and it would be a mistake
to dance to their tune..

52:07.480 --> 52:10.680
<i>Under normal circumstances
I would agree.</i>

52:11.160 --> 52:16.360
<i>But.. well, my advise is...</i>

52:16.360 --> 52:19.480
I've been taking the temperature
among people on the streets..

52:20.600 --> 52:22.760
And.. well, the
information I'm getting...

52:22.760 --> 52:25.840
is that the mood...

52:25.840 --> 52:27.680
<i>is quite delicate...</i>

52:30.800 --> 52:32.720
So, what would you suggest,
Prime Minister?

52:32.720 --> 52:34.600
Some kind of a statement?

52:34.800 --> 52:40.440
No, Ma'am. I believe that the
moment for statements, has passed..

52:43.360 --> 52:47.040
<i>I would suggest flying the flag
at half mast above Buckingham Palace...</i>

52:49.040 --> 52:54.800
and coming down to London,
at the earliest opportunity.

52:55.360 --> 52:57.760
<i>It would be a
great comfort to your people...</i>

52:59.880 --> 53:02.880
and would help them
with their grief.

53:03.440 --> 53:05.880
Their.. grief?

53:06.600 --> 53:08.880
If you imagine I am going
to drop everything, and come

53:08.880 --> 53:11.160
down to London, before I
attend to my grandchildren...

53:11.160 --> 53:12.520
who have just lost their mother..

53:14.080 --> 53:15.600
then you're mistaken!

53:17.240 --> 53:19.000
I doubt there is anyone,
who knows

53:19.000 --> 53:21.120
the British people
more than I do, Mr. Blair...

53:21.160 --> 53:24.320
nor who has greater faith
in their wisdom and judgement.

53:25.400 --> 53:30.400
And it is my belief they will any
moment reject this.. this mood...

53:31.400 --> 53:34.000
which is being stired up
by the press.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.280
In favour of a period of
restrained grief...

53:37.280 --> 53:39.800
and sober private mourning.

53:41.240 --> 53:43.480
That's the way we do
things in this country...

53:43.480 --> 53:47.400
quietly.. with dignity.

53:49.520 --> 53:51.960
That's what the rest of
the world has always admired us for.

53:51.960 --> 53:54.040
If that's your decision, Ma'am...

53:54.040 --> 53:56.120
then of course,
the government will support it..

53:57.280 --> 53:58.680
Let's keep in touch.

53:59.160 --> 54:01.120
Yes. Let's.

54:07.560 --> 54:09.000
Bloody fool...

54:09.600 --> 54:11.880
and now your tea's gone cold.

54:16.400 --> 54:19.240
Tony... Robin Janvrin on one.

54:19.720 --> 54:20.960
He was listening in..

54:26.160 --> 54:27.040
Robin.

54:27.840 --> 54:30.360
I understand how
difficult her behaviour must

54:30.360 --> 54:32.880
seem to you.
How unhelpful...

54:32.880 --> 54:36.960
but try to see it from her perspective.
She's been brought up to believe...

54:36.960 --> 54:38.680
it's God's will...

54:38.680 --> 54:40.320
<i>she is who she is.</i>

54:40.320 --> 54:42.840
I think we should
leave God out of it.

54:42.840 --> 54:45.760
It's just..
not helpful.

54:45.760 --> 54:48.960
she just won't have seen anything
like this since the abdication...

54:48.960 --> 54:52.200
and I can not emphasise enough
what affect that had on her.

54:52.200 --> 54:55.600
Unexpectedly becoming King
as good as killed her father.

54:56.480 --> 54:58.760
I'm afraid she's in
a state of shock.

54:58.760 --> 55:01.680
This public reaction
has completely thrown her.

55:02.160 --> 55:03.280
Alright...

55:05.000 --> 55:07.720
but first we have to
deal with these terrible headlines.

55:07.720 --> 55:10.440
I'll see what I can do
with the press.

55:10.440 --> 55:12.080
I'm most grateful,
Prime Minister.

55:14.080 --> 55:15.520
Well I can't promise anything...

55:15.520 --> 55:18.200
it's not me they want to see.

55:42.040 --> 55:43.520
Ask Alastair to come and see me.

55:43.520 --> 55:44.840
Yes...

55:48.280 --> 55:50.920
Cancel what I'm doing tonight.

55:56.280 --> 55:57.040
Good morning.

55:57.040 --> 55:58.400
- Your Majesty.
- Morning, Ma'am.

55:58.400 --> 56:00.400
Thomas.. where have
they gone today?

56:00.400 --> 56:02.120
Up to Ardverikie Reach, Ma'am.

56:02.720 --> 56:06.280
All that way.. Remind me..
that's the track up north..

56:06.280 --> 56:10.120
That's right, Ma'am.. You follow
the track for about a mile...

56:10.120 --> 56:11.680
- and then you come to...
- The river.

56:14.160 --> 56:17.000
- One of the lads will drive you..
- No, no. I'll manage.. thank you.

57:20.560 --> 57:21.280
Oh great..

57:44.440 --> 57:45.920
Oh! Stupid..

58:08.240 --> 58:10.560
- Hello, Thomas..
- Hello, Ma'am...

58:10.560 --> 58:12.440
I'm afraid I've done
something rather foolish.

58:12.440 --> 58:14.320
I've broken the
prop shaft crossing the river.

58:14.920 --> 58:16.760
- Are you sure, Ma'am?
- Yes, of course I'm sure.

58:16.760 --> 58:18.600
It's the front one, not the rear.

58:18.600 --> 58:20.520
It was a four-wheel drive.

58:20.520 --> 58:22.840
Don't forget.. I used to be a
mechanic during the war.

58:23.480 --> 58:25.880
- And, are you alright?
- Yeah yeah, I'm perfectly alright...

58:25.880 --> 58:30.040
- We'll come about straight away.
- Oh, would you.. Thank you very much.

58:30.040 --> 58:30.840
I'll wait by the car.
You are kind.. bye.

59:46.240 --> 59:47.760
Oh.. you're a beauty..

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:07.400
Shoo.. go on!

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:12.160
go on... go on..

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.560
Just been told
there are news crews outside...

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.640
waiting for you to
come and speak to the people..

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.520
- Yes...
- What's all that about?

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.200
I told The
Queen's private secretary

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.840
I'd do what I could,
to help with the press.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.440
Why?
Don't you think she deserves it?

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.600
Sitting up there
on her 40000 acres.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:09.320
Yeah, but allowing her to hang herself,
might not be in our best interest either.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.960
Besides... I think there's something...

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.080
ugly, about the way
everyone started to bully her..

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.520
The first thing you
obviously think about, is...

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.000
the rest of your family.
And I think..

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:52.720
she wanted me to pass on to
the people here, crowding around her...

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.000
How are the boys?

01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.240
Not so good, tonight.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.200
A lot of slamming doors..
I think they saw the papers.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.560
Oh no..

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.560
I'll take them out early
again, tomorrow morning...

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.160
Let them take
it out on the stag.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.000
<i>What do you think of the way
the royal family have behaved?</i>

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.160
<i>- They've made a serious mistake.
- Pardon?</i>

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.880
<i>They've made a serious mistake.</i>

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:22.480
<i>Why, what do you mean?</i>

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:27.720
<i>Well, they should have came...
the family should have come down...</i>

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.800
<i>to Buckingham Palace, on
sunday afternoon.. all of them...</i>

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.800
<i>That girl has been left on her own.
She's on her own up there...</i>

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:36.880
<i>and the place is empty.</i>

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:38.960
Oh please...

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.520
Sleeping in the streets and
pulling out their hair...

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.160
for someone they never knew..

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.680
and they think we're mad.

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.680
Have you seen the latest
funeral guest list?

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.720
No...

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.840
I suggest you keep it that way..

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.000
A chorus line of soap stars
and homosexuals..

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.640
Apparently Elton John
is going to be singing.

01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:02.240
That would be a first
for Westminster Abbey.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.120
Condolence books are now being
signed in our embassies

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.840
in every major city
in the world.

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.040
And in London alone,
the number has reached 40.

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.720
It reminds me of one
of those films.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.920
A few of us in a fort...

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.640
hordes of Zulus outside.

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.040
So it's vital you hold firm.

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.040
Stick to your guns...

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.400
you wait.. they will
come to their senses soon..

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.640
they have to.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.440
Come on!
Move over cabbage!

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.840
<i>Good morning,
it's 6 o'clock on Thursday</i>

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.560
<i>the 4th of september.
I'm Penny Smith...</i>

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.880
<i>and I'm Matthew Lorenzo..</i>

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:50.360
<i>as the first people
start camping out...</i>

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.120
<i>on the route of Princess
Dianas funeral courtage...</i>

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.280
<i> questions are being asked
about why the Queen...</i>

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.240
<i>hasn't addressed her subjects...</i>

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.200
<i>at this time of national grief.</i>

01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.880
This is what the newspapers
are saying this morning. The Sun...

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:03.920
Where is our Queen?
Where is her flag?

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:12.400
The Express,
show us you care...

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:13.520
picture of a grumpy Queen.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.800
The Mail, let the
flag fly at half mast...

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:20.320
and inside.. the Queen should
be here to show her respect.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:24.960
But the flip side is,
they're more popular now...

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.480
than Churchill's chocolate.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:29.000
Did any of them pick up
on our statement of support?

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.400
Well, just the one...

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.200
Statements of support,
doesn't sell papers.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.640
Ma'am... Ma'am...

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.280
the Prime Minister
for you, Ma'am.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.840
I'm afraid he's rather insisting.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.400
I'll take it in the kitchen.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.640
Good morning,
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.200
I'm just expecting a
phone call to come through here.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.640
Out!

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:13.280
Oh, there it is..

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.240
Thank you.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:25.280
- Good morning, Prime Minister.
- Good morning, Ma'am.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.520
You've seen today's headlines?

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:30.360
Yes, I have.

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:34.600
Then I'm sure you'll agree..
the situation has become..

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.080
quite critical.

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.640
Ma'am?

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.120
A poll that's to be published in
tomorrow's papers...

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.840
suggests that
70 procent of people believe

01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:49.720
that your actions
have damaged the Monarchy.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:55.040
And that, one in four,
are now in favour...

01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.240
of abolishing the Monarchy
all together.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:01.040
As your Prime Minister...

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:05.120
I believe it is my
constitutional responsibility...

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.280
to advise the following...

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.000
Is Queen Elizabeth up yet?

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.040
Mummy?

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.760
one.. fly the flag at half mast
above Buckingham Palace

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.720
and all other
royal residences...

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.480
two.. leave Balmoral and fly down
to London at the earliest opportunity...

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:51.480
three.. pay respects,
in person, at Diana's coffin...

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:56.760
and four.. make a statement
via live television...

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.680
to my people
and the world.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.240
Swift prosecution of
these matters might, he felt...

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.080
just might..
avert disaster.

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.960
You will have to talk to the
Lord Chamberlain about all this.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.560
Well I have..

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:15.360
and to Robert Fellows, and it
seems they both agree with Mr. Blair.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.520
Oh, I see...

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.160
Something's happened..
there's been a change.. some...

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.640
shift in values.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.880
When you no longer
understand your people, mummy...

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.920
maybe it is time to
hand it over to the next generation?

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.440
Oh, don't be ridiculous..

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.440
remember the vow you took?

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.280
I declare that my whole life,
whether it be long or short...

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.360
shall be devoted to your service.

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.200
Your whole life.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.880
That is a commitment to God...

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.120
as well as your people.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.720
But what if my actions
are damaging the Crown?

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.360
Damaging it!?

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:56.840
You're the greatest asset
this institution has...

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.480
one of the greatest
it has ever had.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:06.960
The problem will come when you leave..
but you mustn't think about that now...

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.400
Certainly not today.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.480
Oh, mummy..

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.080
You must show your strenght...

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.440
reasert your authority.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.160
You sit on the most
powerful throne in Europe.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:23.560
Head of an unbroken line that
goes back more than a thousand years.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:27.800
Do you think any of your predecessors
would have dropped everything...

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:31.479
and gone up to London
because a bunch of hysterics..

01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:34.720
carrying candles,
needed help with their grief?

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.600
As for that...

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.880
silly Mr. Blair..
with his Cheshire Cat grin...

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.399
Mr. Janvrin on the
phone for you, Sir..

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:02.720
Yes?

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.120
What?

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:06.160
I can't hear!

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.840
That's madness...
the whole thing!

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:13.960
Bloody madness!

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:19.560
I've just been told...

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:25.080
You've... decided to follow the
Prime Minister's advise...

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:27.520
I just want to say, I...

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.319
admire...

01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:34.680
I think it's the right decision.

01:09:36.479 --> 01:09:38.560
Let's hope we haven't
left it too late.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.360
<i>Clearly The Queen
has had a change of heart...</i>

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.520
<i>she's clearly responding to
the need to feel...</i>

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.520
<i>that the royal family
is somehow engaged.</i>

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.760
<i>These are flowers that have been
brought to the gates of Balmoral...</i>

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.080
<i>so that she can actually see</i>

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.040
<i>some token, of what's been
expressed down here in London..</i>

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:42.560
- Fish Fingers.. do you want any?
- I'll be right there..

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.280
Thank God, for that!

01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:20.880
<i>Britain's Queen Elisabeth will
deliver a televised address Friday...</i>

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.960
<i>the royal family has been accused
of not showing enough remorse...</i>

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:25.440
<i>over Princess Diana's death...</i>

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.360
Where are the boys?
Have they already left?

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.080
Yes...

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.960
they left for London,
after breakfast, with Charles.

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:55.280
It's not right, you know...

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.200
No, but further discussion
is no longer helpful, either.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.880
Oh, well..

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.520
I suppose it does give the ghillies time
to find another stag for the boys.

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.760
- Now there's has been shot.
- What?

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.280
Haven't you heard?

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.960
He wandered over to one
of the neighbouring estates...

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.600
where one of the
commercial guests got him.

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:19.600
Oh.. really?

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.800
Which estate?

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.400
Here's your box.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.840
There's some policy and
stuff in here that's important.

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.360
Have you seen the papers?

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:49.000
No, I thought I'd give them a miss today..
of course I've seen the papers!

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:53.400
Not bad, eh.. Your Majesty
have come down to London...

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.680
Who says that?
Tony Blair.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.480
Mr. Father of the nation.

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:16.520
Ma'am...

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:17.680
- Good morning, Ma'am.
- Good morning.

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.720
Is it his Lordship,
you've come to see?

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:24.400
No, please don't disturb him..
I've come on another matter..

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.760
I hope you don't mind?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:47.960
There he is..

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.480
a beauty, isn't he?

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.840
An imperial, Ma'am.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.200
14 pointer.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:09.200
- He was wounded?
- Yes...

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:13.880
We got our guest in very close..
had him lined up perfect.

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:16.560
And still...

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:20.080
an investment banker, Ma'am..
from London.

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:24.320
I'm afraid the stalkers had to
follow him for miles, to finish him off..

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.640
Let's hope he didn't suffer too much.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.280
Please pass my congratulations,
to your guest.

01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:43.160
I will, Ma'am...

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.120
God bless you, Ma'am.

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:53.360
Thank you.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.880
- Ma'am?
- Yes, Robin...

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:30.800
I've done a draft,
of your television address.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:31.880
Thank you.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.920
Was there anything else?

01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.400
No, Ma'am.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.360
Landing in 15 minutes.

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.880
I've got The Queen's speech.

01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:00.520
- Shall I give Tony a copy?
- No, let me have a look at it first...

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:01.520
- He's next door.

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:55.200
<i>The Queen is getting out of the car...
and is going to talk to people.</i>

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:59.040
<i>It's extremely unusual..
this is almost unprecedented..</i>

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.440
<i>I think perhaps the last time
The Queen was among her people...</i>

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:06.560
<i>outside the Palace..
was the day the war in Europe ended.</i>

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:30.480
They sent a copy
of The Queen's speech...

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:34.600
Well, let's get the frost off it first.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.680
I've phoned them
with a couple of suggestions...

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.200
to make it sound like it
came from a human being.

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.120
Yeah, alright Alastair..

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:53.840
Well at least the old bat has
finally agreed to visit Diana's coffin.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:56.360
When you get it wrong,
you really get it wrong...

01:17:56.920 --> 01:18:00.920
that woman has given her
whole life in service to her people.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:03.560
50 years doing the job,
she never wanted...

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.560
a job she watched kill her father...

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:10.000
she's executed it with honour, dignity,
and as far as I could tell...

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.800
without a single blemish,
and now we're all baying for her blood.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:15.600
All because she's struggling
to lead the world in mourning

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:18.360
for someone who threw everything
she offered back in her face.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.120
and who for the last few years
seemed commited 24/7

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.840
to destroying everything
she holds most dear.

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.520
Hello.. would you like
me to place those for you?

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.600
No...

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.520
Oh...

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:34.080
These are for you.

01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:37.880
For me?

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:42.760
Thank you.

01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.120
Thank you very much.

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:18.440
There's been a last minute
addition from Downing Street.

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:21.040
They're suggesting adding,
'and as a grandmother'...

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:22.760
here.
- Right.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:31.840
So what I say to you now, as
your Queen, and as a grandmother...

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:34.440
I say from my heart.

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.360
You think you can say it?

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:40.440
- Do I have a choice?
- We're ready for you, Your Majesty.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:45.920
Just to confirm,
this is going out live.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.720
- Fine.
- And you'll be at the front of

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.520
the 6 o'clock news..
on all the channels.

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.920
Yes.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:34.920
<i>- Okay, nice and quiet..
- Ten seconds, everyone!</i>

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:41.960
<i>We cross now, live,
to Buckingham Palace...</i>

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:44.480
<i>for the Queen's tribute
to Princess Diana.</i>

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:53.120
Since last Sundays'
dreadful news...

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:55.800
we have seen throughout Britain,
and around the world...

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:59.720
an overwhelming expression
of sadness at Diana's death.

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:04.800
We have all been trying,
in our different ways, to cope...

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:08.200
it is not easy
to express a sense of loss...

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:10.560
since the initial shock,
is often succeeded

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.520
by a mixture
of other feelings...

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:17.760
disbelief, incomprehension, anger..
and concern for those who remain.

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:24.040
We have all felt those
emotions in these last few days...

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:28.320
so what I say to you now,
as your Queen, and as a grandmother...

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.560
I say from my heart.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.880
Heart..
What heart?

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:35.800
She doesn't mean a word of this.

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:39.080
That's not the point.
What she's doing is extraordinary.

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.040
That's how to survive.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:44.320
Listen to you..

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:47.600
a week ago you were the
great moderniser...

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:50.120
making speeches
about the people's Princess.

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:52.600
Now you've gone weak at the knees.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:58.560
You know.. I don't know
why I'm so surprised..

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.200
at the end of the day,
all Labour Prime Ministers...

01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:04.320
go ga-ga for the Queen.

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.360
What?

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:16.160
I, for one, believe that there are
lessons to be drawn from her life...

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:19.720
and from the extraordinary,
and moving, reaction to her death.

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:24.640
I share in your determination,
to cherish her memory.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:29.160
I hope that tomorrow we
can all, wherever we are...

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:32.760
join in expressing our grief,
at Diana's loss...

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:35.720
and gratitude for her
all too short life.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.120
May those who died,
rest in peace...

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:42.080
and may we,
each and everyone of us...

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:47.560
thank God, for someone who
made many, many people, happy.

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:57.200
<i>Diana's coffin, now on the move...</i>

01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:59.360
<i>the short distance
from St. James' Palace...</i>

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:02.720
<i>to her home at Kensington
Palace, for the final night...</i>

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:04.480
<i>before her burial tomorrow.</i>

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.200
<i>It's incredible...</i>

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.920
<i>less than a week.</i>

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.360
<i>Who could have imagined,
such scenes?</i>

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:27.360
Diana was the very essence
of compassion, of duty...

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.880
of style, of beauty.

01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:32.080
A very British girl...

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:34.240
who transcended nationality.

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.040
Someone with
a natural nobility...

01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:40.560
who was classless, and who
proved in the last year...

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:44.040
that she needed no royal title
to continue to generate...

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:45.920
a particular brand of magic.

01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:52.160
I would like to end by,
thanking God...

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.880
for the small mercies he's
shown us at this dreadful time...

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.960
for taking Diana at
her most beautiful and radiant.

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:01.160
And when she had joy,
in her private life.

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.560
Above all, we give thanks
for the life of a woman...

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:07.240
I'm so proud
to be able to call my sister.

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:10.080
The uniqe, the complexed...

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:13.120
the extraordinary,
and irreplaceable, Diana.

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:16.520
Who's beauty, both internal
and external...

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:19.320
will never be extinguished
from our minds.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:17.560
- So, off to see your girlfriend?
- Now, now.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:20.920
You know, I hope she
shows you some respect this time.

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:23.760
It's quite a debt of gratitude,
she owes you.

01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:26.880
Mr. Saviour of the Monarchy.

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.400
I doubt she'll see it that way..

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:36.680
- Robin.. good to see you.
- Prime Minister.

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:37.560
Tony, please.

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.680
The Prime Minister,
Your Majesty.

01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.440
Do sit down.

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:01.520
Thank you.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:14.400
It's good to see you again.

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:18.800
After what's been..
quite a summer.

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:21.680
I'm refering to your visit
to India.. and Pakistan.

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:25.080
Where your comments on
ending historic disagreements...

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:26.880
went down very well.

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.520
On the commonwealth heads
of government meeting...

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.720
I spoke to the Prime Minister of Malawi...

01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:36.120
and he was saying
how much he appreciated your...

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.520
tough stands on Nigeria...

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:40.320
I meant to tell you at the time, but...

01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:43.720
you were being monopolised, rather...

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:49.160
I imagine those occations
must be quite difficult.

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:54.320
24 heads of government, each
clamouring for a private audience.

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:03.080
Also we have another
chance to speak, since.. that week.

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.120
And I wanted to offer my apologies.

01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.440
Whatever for?

01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:13.880
In case you felt manhandled, or..
managed, in any way.

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:15.240
No, not at all.

01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:24.360
I don't think I shall ever understand,
what happened this summer.

01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:28.480
Well.. the circumstances
were exceptional, Ma'am..

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:32.440
and in the end you
showed great personal strenght...

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.920
courage and humility.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.480
You're confusing humility,
with humiliation.

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:38.920
That's not true.

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:42.760
You didn't read the cards on the
flowers outside the Palace, that Friday.

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:46.680
I actually think history will show,
it was a good week for you.

01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:48.640
And an even better one
for you, Mr. Blair.

01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:51.920
But there are 52 weeks
in the year, Ma'am...

01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:56.720
and 2500 in the time
since you've been Queen.

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:02.200
And when people come
to assess your legacy...

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.360
they won't remember those few days.
- Oh, really?

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:09.320
You don't think what affection
people once had for...

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.080
for this institution...

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:14.200
has been diminished?

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.200
No...

01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.520
not at all.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:19.560
You're more respected now,
than ever...

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:23.400
I gather some of your closest advisers
were less fulsome in their support.

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.120
One or two...

01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:30.880
but as a leader, I could never
have added my voice to that chorus.

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:32.040
Because you saw those headlines,
and you thought...

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:34.160
one day that might happen to me.

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:38.320
And it will, Mr. Blair.

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.920
Quite suddenly, and without warning.

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:46.160
So.. shall we get on
with the business in hand?

01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.320
Oh, look...

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.600
I do love this time of day.

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:55.520
Shall we walk, while there is still light?

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:58.400
You know the clocks go back
next week, it will be dark before five.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:01.480
- I do hope you're a walker?
- I am...

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:04.520
Good.. I always think these meetings
have a far greater chance of success...

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:06.520
if the Prime Minister is a walker.

01:31:07.560 --> 01:31:09.560
As a matter of fact,  that's
how I think best.. on my feet..

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:12.600
I've never been one
for sitting around endlessly...

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:15.160
a good walk and fresh air
sorts everything out.

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.680
One in four.. you said..
wanted to get rid of me.

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:25.400
For about half an hour.

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:27.200
But then...

01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:30.360
you came down to London,
and all that went away.

01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:35.320
I've never been hated
like that before.

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:37.760
Then, that
must have been difficult..

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.600
Yes...

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:41.040
very.

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:48.880
Nowadays people want glamour,
and tears, the grand performance.

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:51.480
I'm not very good at that,
I never have been...

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.200
I prefer to keep
my feelings to myself.

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:59.920
And foolishly I believed that was
what people wanted from their Queen...

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:03.200
not to make a fuss, nor wear one's
heart on one's sleeve...

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:05.440
duty first, self second.

01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:08.880
That's how I was brought up...

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:12.200
that's all I've ever known.

01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:14.720
You were so young
when you became Queen.

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:22.120
Yes...

01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:25.600
Yes, a girl.

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:33.760
But I can see
that the world has changed...

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:38.080
and one must.. modernise.

01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:42.680
Well, perhaps that's where I can help.

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.480
Don't get ahead of yourself,
Prime Minister, and remember...

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:49.040
I am the one
supposed to be advising you.
