put something in there

10:15.073 --> 10:16.866

someone put a phone in her bag,

10:20.620 --> 10:22.205

how she got detention,

10:22.247 --> 10:23.873

10:46.855 --> 10:48.857
Somebody plant
this peanut oil in there?

10:48.898 --> 10:50.900

10:50.942 --> 10:54.112
I use it for my hair

10:54.154 --> 10:57.824
and--look, this peanut oil
could not have killed Simon.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.993
Peanut oil has to be
cold pressed for someone

11:00.035 --> 11:02.203
with allergies to react to it,
and that's basically

11:02.245 --> 11:06.499
only the super bougie
gourmet kind, basically.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.543
- How do you know that?

11:08.585 --> 11:10.045
- Saw it on the Food Network.

11:10.086 --> 11:14.174
- Maybe that's something
you should keep to yourself.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.009
- We'll run some tests
against the samples

11:16.051 --> 11:18.053
we found in the library.

11:22.974 --> 11:26.436

If you did,

I'm sure you had a perfectly
good reason for taking it,

11:38.239 --> 11:41.242

because if we find it

11:41.284 --> 11:44.120

hiding it and lying about it,

11:44.162 --> 11:46.206

a chance to come clean,

11:46.247 --> 11:47.666

how that's gonna sound

11:47.707 --> 11:49.084

11:49.125 --> 11:51.503
You got something to say?

11:54.297 --> 11:57.133
- Yes, um...

12:01.054 --> 12:03.056
Why are we even talking
about the laptop

12:03.098 --> 12:04.891

in Addy's locker?

12:04.933 --> 12:07.811

12:07.852 --> 12:09.104
some of us actually like
to spend money

12:09.145 --> 12:10.438

12:10.480 --> 12:12.190

you guys here.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.775
This is serious.

12:13.817 --> 12:16.111
Why do you think I'm sitting
here instead of Officer Miller?

12:16.152 --> 12:18.947
I'm a homicide detective.

This is now
a murder investigation.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.784

- Murder?

12:22.826 --> 12:25.495

in Simon's cup

12:25.537 --> 12:26.746
and only Simon's cup.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.373
We also found capsule residue.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.084
Someone put peanut oil
into a capsule

12:31.126 --> 12:33.128
and dropped it in the water
in Simon's drink.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.255
That happens in the moment,
in the room.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.341
So your teacher left the room.

You didn't see anybody
come in or out.

find his diary or something.

You know, he kept one

you said you got detention
in a weird way, too?

21:37.547 --> 21:41.134
- Yeah.

21:41.176 --> 21:45.138
An alarm went off on my phone
that I know I didn't set.

And I remember what you said
about the phone in your bag,

21:47.849 --> 21:49.476

could have set the alarm

two minutes late.

out of my bag or something.

Dude had to pry it open
with a crowbar.

- Maybe the same person
who took the laptop from me?

in the room that day.

- And we were all set up.
- By Ms. Avery?

33:10.865 --> 33:12.742
- It just doesn't seem
like a coincidence.

33:12.784 --> 33:15.036
And then there's
the new About That posts.

33:15.078 --> 33:16.162
Somebody's messing with us.

33:16.204 --> 33:17.872
- Yeah, but that person knew

33:17.914 --> 33:19.332
about what happened
with my locker.

33:19.374 --> 33:21.001
You were the only ones
that were there.

33:21.042 --> 33:22.711
- Are you sure you didn't
tell Vanessa?

33:22.752 --> 33:24.587
I mean, the two of you seem to
be gossiping a lot these days.

33:24.629 --> 33:25.672
- Vanessa and Jake
wouldn't tell.

33:25.714 --> 33:28.591
I know them.
I don't know you.

33:28.633 --> 33:30.510
- Oh, well,
let me introduce myself.

33:30.552 --> 33:32.846
I'm not the one who had
peanut oil in their locker

33:32.887 --> 33:34.347
or my signature
in the nurse's log--

33:34.389 --> 33:35.932
- It's not cold pressed.
I already told the cop--

33:35.974 --> 33:38.059
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up
for a second, all right?

33:38.101 --> 33:40.603
Why would someone single out
the four of us for anything?

33:40.645 --> 33:43.148
- The About That posts.
The ones Simon was teasing?

33:43.189 --> 33:45.066
What if someone thought
they were about us?

33:45.108 --> 33:46.401
- But they weren't.

33:46.443 --> 33:47.902
- I think it's safe
to assume one was about me.

33:47.944 --> 33:49.195
- Yeah, naturally.

33:49.237 --> 33:50.447
- Weren't you calling me
a nice guy,

33:50.488 --> 33:51.781
like, five minutes ago?

33:51.823 --> 33:53.658
- Mm-hmm, before you were
selling drugs at a wake.

33:53.700 --> 33:56.619
- And you've never done
a criminal thing in your life?

33:59.372 --> 34:02.292
So you guys have no secrets?
- No.

34:02.334 --> 34:03.960
- No.
- No.

34:04.002 --> 34:07.464
And even if Simon thought
he had something on one of us,

34:07.505 --> 34:09.049
that doesn't mean
he got it right.

34:09.090 --> 34:10.133
- Is that why you told Vanessa

34:10.175 --> 34:12.302
that the cheating one
was about Keely?

34:12.344 --> 34:13.762
- Can we go back to the setup?

34:13.803 --> 34:15.263
I think we should go
to the police.

34:15.305 --> 34:17.265
- Yeah, of course
you trust the cops.

34:17.307 --> 34:18.433
- Excuse me?

34:18.475 --> 34:19.726
- You know
what they'll tell you?

34:19.768 --> 34:20.977
That one of us could have
framed the other three

34:21.019 --> 34:22.520
and then pretend
like she was framed too.

34:22.562 --> 34:24.314
I mean, you could literally
be pushing this entire theory

34:24.356 --> 34:25.648
so we don't suspect you.

34:25.690 --> 34:26.983
- Oh, so you're
accusing me now?

34:27.025 --> 34:28.985
- Without Simon,
you get to be valedictorian.

34:29.027 --> 34:30.737
- You seem to have given this
a lot of thought, man.

34:30.779 --> 34:31.946

given it enough thought, man.

we did it together.

It's only motive
if people know about it,

44:06.104 --> 44:07.313
and they don't.

44:07.355 --> 44:09.733
That secret died
with Simon, okay?

44:09.774 --> 44:12.027
- Because someone killed him.

44:12.068 --> 44:13.528
And now they're trying
to frame us.

44:13.570 --> 44:15.238
- Okay, but do you really think

44:15.280 --> 44:17.782
that Ms. Avery stole
Simon's laptop?

44:17.824 --> 44:19.909
I mean, I don't even think
she would know how to log in.

44:19.951 --> 44:22.329
- I don't know
who's doing this,

44:22.370 --> 44:25.332
but whoever's doing it
hated Simon.

44:25.373 --> 44:27.083
- A lot of people hated Simon.

44:27.125 --> 44:29.711
- Yeah, but who also hated us?

I know I messed up, all right?

44:42.057 --> 44:44.601
But when we first met,

44:44.642 --> 44:46.519
I thought that it'd be
a one-time thing.

44:46.561 --> 44:48.355
So I didn't think that
it was important to tell you

44:48.396 --> 44:50.815
that I wasn't in college
because...

44:50.857 --> 44:53.068
I never thought
that I'd ever see you again.

44:53.109 --> 44:54.694

44:54.736 --> 44:57.238
- No, no, no,
you're not--no, please.

44:59.282 --> 45:01.326

Cooper, I don't care
that you're 17, all right?

45:12.420 --> 45:15.215
I was just in high school
a year ago.

45:15.256 --> 45:18.468
I care that you lied to me.
