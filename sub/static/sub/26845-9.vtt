00:05.189 --> 00:07.189
( music playing )

00:36.065 --> 00:38.398
( birds chirping )

00:38.481 --> 00:40.439
( cars passing by )

00:56.356 --> 00:58.523
You OK, honey?

00:58.606 --> 01:00.898
Yeah, just give me a minute.

01:06.690 --> 01:08.356
( door closes )

01:17.065 --> 01:20.107
( dialing phone )

01:20.189 --> 01:22.606
( line out ringing )

01:22.690 --> 01:25.314
- Man: Hey, Sarah.
- Hey, Dad.

01:25.398 --> 01:27.982
How'd she do
in the car ride?

01:28.065 --> 01:30.107
Uh, she was good.

01:31.731 --> 01:32.982
Quiet.

01:33.065 --> 01:34.481
And sad.

01:34.565 --> 01:36.940
Well, it sounds
easier than usual.

01:37.023 --> 01:39.356
At least she's not screaming.

01:39.439 --> 01:41.648
Listen, I know
you're feeling conflicted

01:41.731 --> 01:43.648
on whether this is a good idea.

01:43.731 --> 01:47.439
I think you need to let her do
whatever it is she needs to do.

01:47.523 --> 01:48.857
Let her get it
out of her system,

01:48.940 --> 01:51.107
and try not
to come down on her.

01:51.189 --> 01:53.481
OK, well, that's what
I've been trying to do
for the last five months,

01:53.565 --> 01:55.273
and clearly
that's not working.

01:55.356 --> 01:57.523
I'm sorry.
Don't get defensive.

01:57.606 --> 02:00.523
I'm not trying to criticize
or tell you what to do,

02:00.606 --> 02:02.356
I'm just trying to help.

02:02.439 --> 02:03.731
I know this isn't easy.

02:03.815 --> 02:05.273
And for what it's worth,

02:05.356 --> 02:07.314
I think you're doing
a fantastic job.

02:07.398 --> 02:09.773
Well, we both know
that's not true.

02:09.857 --> 02:11.898
Honey, she'll come back around.

02:11.982 --> 02:13.690
This isn't gonna
last forever.

02:13.773 --> 02:16.189
- ( door opens )
- Dad, can I call you back?

02:16.273 --> 02:18.231
- Sure. Bye.
- OK, bye.

02:23.231 --> 02:25.065
I had an idea.

02:26.314 --> 02:28.314
What's your idea?

02:28.398 --> 02:29.815
Well...

02:29.898 --> 02:33.398
I don't want to
say goodbye to him.

02:34.940 --> 02:36.815
But...

02:36.898 --> 02:39.857
it's what we came here to do.

02:39.940 --> 02:41.898
That's what you asked for, so...

02:41.982 --> 02:44.606
But I miss him.

02:44.690 --> 02:47.648
I know you do, honey.
We all do.

02:47.731 --> 02:49.940
You keep saying that.

02:50.023 --> 02:53.356
But then you just
keep trying to push him away.

02:53.439 --> 02:57.231
Honey, we're not gonna
have that discussion again.

02:57.314 --> 02:59.606
I loved him
just as much as you did,

02:59.690 --> 03:02.065
and I miss him
just as much as you do.

03:02.148 --> 03:04.773
So let's contact him.

03:06.815 --> 03:08.773
I'm sorry?

03:08.857 --> 03:10.565
Here's my idea.

03:10.648 --> 03:13.273
I know you're gonna
think it's silly, but...

03:13.356 --> 03:17.107
you know how much
Dad and I loved
Harry Potter.

03:17.189 --> 03:19.356
We all did.

03:19.439 --> 03:21.481
Right. Of course.

03:21.565 --> 03:24.857
So I brought some things.

03:24.940 --> 03:28.273
I wrote him
a kind of a spell.

03:28.356 --> 03:30.940
To contact him.

03:31.023 --> 03:34.023
I was thinking
we could try it.

03:38.023 --> 03:41.107
Are you sure
you want to do that?

03:41.189 --> 03:42.815
Yeah.

03:46.731 --> 03:48.107
( grunts )

03:51.065 --> 03:54.398
OK, then...
let's do it.

03:57.273 --> 03:58.898
Dear Dad,

03:58.982 --> 04:01.314
you died of
a surprise heart attack

04:01.398 --> 04:04.273
one hundred
and fifty-seven days ago...

04:04.356 --> 04:07.439
in this bed,
in your sleep,

04:07.523 --> 04:09.940
sometime in
the middle of the night.

04:10.023 --> 04:14.023
We were supposed to go
to Aunt Justine's birthday party
the next day.

04:14.107 --> 04:16.148
I remember knowing
something was wrong

04:16.231 --> 04:19.815
because your leg felt cold
under mine when I woke up.

04:19.898 --> 04:23.273
Mom was still snoring
very loudly.

04:23.356 --> 04:26.231
I don't know where you are
or what you are,

04:26.314 --> 04:29.065
but do you still
look like you?

04:29.148 --> 04:32.314
Red beard and freckles?

04:32.398 --> 04:35.815
Are you in heaven?
Is  there even a heaven?

04:35.898 --> 04:38.481
Or are you in my heart
like you always said
you would be

04:38.565 --> 04:40.398
if anything bad happened?

04:40.481 --> 04:43.648
I don't know,
but I do believe that
you can hear me.

04:43.731 --> 04:46.107
Mom does too. Right?

04:47.439 --> 04:49.314
- Yeah.
- So I've written a spell.

04:49.398 --> 04:52.398
If you can hear me,
the spell will help you
talk to us.

04:52.481 --> 04:55.398
On three, we read
the spell together.

04:55.481 --> 04:56.982
We have to believe.

04:57.065 --> 04:59.189
- Very important.
- OK. OK.

04:59.273 --> 05:01.523
One, two, three.

05:01.606 --> 05:05.648
- Loquatus con mortem amore.
- Locust con mortem amore.

05:05.731 --> 05:09.189
"Loquatus,"  not "locusts,"
or whatever you said.

05:09.273 --> 05:11.898
Oh. OK. Sorry.

05:11.982 --> 05:13.731
One two, three.

05:13.815 --> 05:17.523
Both:
Loquatus con mortem amore.

05:25.857 --> 05:28.481
It didn't work.

05:28.565 --> 05:31.648
But... it was
a really good idea, Elle.

05:33.648 --> 05:36.565
And this letter you wrote
is so great.

05:40.690 --> 05:45.731
Maybe-- Maybe we should just
say our goodbyes, and--

05:45.815 --> 05:49.231
I think you need
to go into the bathroom.

05:49.314 --> 05:50.731
Excuse me?

05:50.815 --> 05:53.398
This is only going to work
if everybody believes.

05:53.481 --> 05:55.273
I'm not gonna go
into the bathroom.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.065
Or outside,
or somewhere else!

05:57.189 --> 05:59.107
- Elle--
- Do you believe?

05:59.189 --> 06:02.731
I would like to believe
we can talk to Dad, yes.

06:02.815 --> 06:06.107
But you don't!
So you shouldn't be
a part of this.

06:06.189 --> 06:08.606
- I need to do this alone.
- Sweetheart--

06:08.690 --> 06:11.439
I don't expect you
to understand.

06:11.523 --> 06:14.065
OK, see, this is where
we get into trouble.

06:14.148 --> 06:16.107
It's not trouble.
You just don't get it.

06:16.189 --> 06:18.690
You don't get this!
This is a me-and-Dad thing,
and you--

06:18.773 --> 06:20.565
I'm not gonna be dragged
into this with you again.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.940
You don't even like
Harry Potter!

06:23.023 --> 06:25.940
I do like Harry Potter,
I spent my entire vacation

06:26.023 --> 06:27.815
at Harry Potter World
with you and Dad--

06:27.898 --> 06:29.481
And you complained
the whole time!

06:29.565 --> 06:31.273
I was not  complaining,
I was just questioning

06:31.356 --> 06:33.107
whether we needed to spend
five full days there.

06:33.189 --> 06:34.940
Because you don't get it
like Dad and I do!

06:35.023 --> 06:37.439
And now you're trying
to forget him and push him
out of our lives!

06:37.523 --> 06:39.523
OK, you know what? Nope.
That's it. We're going.

06:39.606 --> 06:43.148
OK, I tried. I tried,
but if you're gonna act
like this,

06:43.231 --> 06:45.356
if you're gonna
treat me like shit,
then we're going.

06:45.439 --> 06:50.023
Give me my bag!
If you want to leave,
I don't care! I'm staying!

06:50.107 --> 06:51.314
If you want to stay,
then you can stay.

06:51.398 --> 06:53.439
- Give me my bag!
- Stop it!

06:53.523 --> 06:56.189
- You need to control--
- Don't you fucking tell me
what to do!

06:56.273 --> 06:59.189
- No!
- Give me my bag!

06:59.273 --> 07:01.314
( panting )

07:01.398 --> 07:02.982
Did you hear that?

07:05.356 --> 07:06.815
What?

07:06.898 --> 07:08.690
That voice.

07:10.065 --> 07:12.565
- No, I didn't--
- I heard it.

07:12.648 --> 07:15.690
It was a muffled voice.

07:15.773 --> 07:17.648
Or voices.

07:17.731 --> 07:21.231
Like a bunch
of computer voices.

07:21.314 --> 07:24.314
And they were all muffle-y.

07:28.857 --> 07:31.857
Elle, I don't know.
Maybe it was the people--

07:31.940 --> 07:33.982
There it is again!

07:34.065 --> 07:36.314
It's coming from the bed!

07:39.898 --> 07:42.314
- Elle, don't do this.
- Shh!

07:46.314 --> 07:48.398
Can't hear it, Mom?

07:50.398 --> 07:52.565
- No, I don't--
- It's talking!

07:52.648 --> 07:54.439
Can't you hear it?

08:08.314 --> 08:11.439
( Elle whispering )
Can you help me talk to my Dad?

08:11.523 --> 08:13.189
Elle.

08:16.398 --> 08:19.065
They think they know
where Dad is!

08:31.731 --> 08:35.481
- Who's "they"?
- The spirit voices.

08:35.565 --> 08:37.481
( whispering )
Can you help me contact him?

08:37.565 --> 08:39.565
What are they saying?

08:39.648 --> 08:41.398
One second, Mom.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.565
They're--

08:44.648 --> 08:46.314
They've--

08:46.398 --> 08:48.773
They've contacted Dad!

08:48.857 --> 08:51.314
I can't believe it,
it's working!

08:51.398 --> 08:54.356
Oh! This is amazing!

08:56.857 --> 09:00.648
( whispering ) Tell him
I say "Hi, it's Elle."
I really miss him.

09:00.731 --> 09:03.648
- Now what's happening?
- Shh!

09:08.398 --> 09:10.940
( whispering )
I'm gonna tell Mom.

09:13.940 --> 09:16.731
Mom, we can talk to him!

09:18.523 --> 09:20.107
OK.

09:20.189 --> 09:22.940
Uh... how does it work?

09:23.023 --> 09:26.273
Well, the voices
can talk to Dad and me,

09:26.356 --> 09:28.731
but you and I can't
talk directly to Dad.

09:28.815 --> 09:30.815
Does that make sense?

09:30.898 --> 09:34.356
Mm-hmm. Sure.

09:34.439 --> 09:37.231
Has he said anything yet?

09:37.314 --> 09:40.148
He said he loves us

09:40.231 --> 09:44.439
and he misses us,
but we shouldn't worry,

09:44.523 --> 09:47.439
because he's not in any pain
or anything.

09:47.523 --> 09:50.648
Well, that's good.

09:50.731 --> 09:52.857
Did he say anything else?

09:54.648 --> 09:56.940
That was really it.

09:58.148 --> 10:01.231
You were under there
for a while.

10:01.314 --> 10:03.148
Nothing else?

10:07.690 --> 10:10.815
It's OK. You can tell me.

10:10.898 --> 10:12.773
Well, the voices...

10:12.857 --> 10:16.648
translate more
than what he's saying.

10:16.731 --> 10:20.356
They actually translate
what he's feeling.

10:21.481 --> 10:23.523
Oh.

10:23.606 --> 10:25.690
And what was that?

10:27.273 --> 10:30.690
Well, I don't want you
to get your feelings hurt.

10:30.773 --> 10:33.148
Oh, honey, it's OK.

10:35.565 --> 10:38.857
Well, the voices...

10:38.940 --> 10:43.189
they said that while he said
he misses us both,

10:43.273 --> 10:46.898
he actually misses me
a bit more than he misses you.

10:52.189 --> 10:55.231
Well, that's
understandable.

10:55.314 --> 10:58.439
- It is?
- Sure.

10:58.523 --> 11:00.565
All three of us
love each other,

11:00.648 --> 11:04.148
but I know you and Dad
had a special connection,

11:04.231 --> 11:06.107
so it makes sense
that the voices

11:06.189 --> 11:08.940
would translate it
that way.

11:13.523 --> 11:15.898
OK. So what do we do now?

11:15.982 --> 11:18.356
We have to give them
a message for Dad.

11:18.439 --> 11:22.481
OK, great. Um...

11:22.565 --> 11:26.148
well, we should tell him
that we love him,

11:26.231 --> 11:28.731
and miss him,

11:28.815 --> 11:31.731
and that we wish
he was with us,

11:31.815 --> 11:34.690
but we understand
that he had to go.

11:34.773 --> 11:39.982
And to give hugs from us
and to say goodbye.

11:40.065 --> 11:43.898
Or we could ask him
if there's any way
that he could come back.

11:46.231 --> 11:49.398
That's... That's an idea.

11:49.481 --> 11:51.231
Worth asking, right?

11:51.314 --> 11:55.023
If he can't, then we can just
do our goodbyes like we planned

11:55.107 --> 11:58.815
but if he could
come back somehow,

11:58.898 --> 12:01.481
that would be the best,
right?

12:06.606 --> 12:09.731
You're right.
That would be the best.

12:09.815 --> 12:11.690
We should check.

12:23.314 --> 12:26.356
( whispering )
Is there any way
he can come back?

12:33.940 --> 12:38.356
( whispering )
That's the only way?
I have to choose?

12:39.356 --> 12:41.356
What's happening?

12:47.565 --> 12:49.815
- ( exhales )
- What's wrong?

12:52.940 --> 12:56.690
Dad said that
there is actually a way

12:56.773 --> 12:58.523
that he could come back.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.773
And what's that?

13:01.857 --> 13:06.314
He would have
to trade places...

13:06.398 --> 13:08.189
with you.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.189
Dad said that?

13:12.273 --> 13:15.606
Well, Dad said that
he could come back,

13:15.690 --> 13:19.565
but there can't be
three of us anymore--
only two.

13:22.940 --> 13:27.107
But he said he would
never want anything bad
to happen to you.

13:28.148 --> 13:29.773
But...

13:31.815 --> 13:35.148
But the voices translated
how he really felt.

13:36.648 --> 13:38.189
Yeah.

13:39.314 --> 13:41.815
And what was that?

13:41.898 --> 13:45.439
That... he...

13:47.648 --> 13:51.065
...misses me so much

13:51.148 --> 13:53.398
that he would actually rather

13:53.481 --> 13:57.231
you be dead...
than him...

13:57.314 --> 14:00.107
so he could come back
and be with me.

14:02.857 --> 14:06.065
Do you agree with Dad?

14:06.148 --> 14:10.356
Would you rather him come back
and me go and take his place?

14:14.065 --> 14:18.398
Because... that's OK
if that's what you want,

14:18.481 --> 14:20.857
if that's what
you're really feeling.

14:22.148 --> 14:24.231
I want you to know that.

14:28.189 --> 14:30.773
Do you mean...

14:30.857 --> 14:36.857
you'd be willing
t-to trade places with Dad...

14:36.940 --> 14:39.398
if that's what I wanted?

14:42.857 --> 14:45.273
I th-- I think--

14:47.023 --> 14:50.731
I think I'd be willing
to do that for you...

14:50.815 --> 14:54.023
if that's what
you really wanted.

14:54.107 --> 14:57.940
OK? You can tell Dad that.

14:58.023 --> 15:01.857
You can tell the voices
to tell Dad, OK?

15:03.189 --> 15:06.898
I want you to know
that's an OK thing to say.

15:08.898 --> 15:11.481
- Elle: What?
- Sarah: Hmm?

15:11.565 --> 15:14.356
Sorry, they're trying
to talk to me again.

15:48.731 --> 15:51.273
( Elle whispering )

15:58.648 --> 16:00.731
What did Dad have to say?

16:02.648 --> 16:05.565
They weren't translating
for Dad this time.

16:06.773 --> 16:08.023
No?

16:08.107 --> 16:11.356
They were translating
for you.

16:11.439 --> 16:13.314
Me?

16:13.398 --> 16:15.690
They said that you
didn't really mean it

16:15.773 --> 16:18.356
when you said
you'd trade with Dad.

16:18.439 --> 16:22.731
That inside, you were secretly
happy that you were alive,

16:22.815 --> 16:25.273
that he was
the one that died
instead of you.

16:25.356 --> 16:28.439
Oh-- Honey,
that's not true.

16:28.523 --> 16:30.523
This is confusing.

16:30.606 --> 16:31.857
I know it is,

16:31.940 --> 16:33.523
but you know what,
your father and I,

16:33.606 --> 16:36.690
we love you so much,
and it's going to be fine, OK?

16:36.773 --> 16:39.898
But you both are saying things,
and you mean different things,

16:39.982 --> 16:42.731
and I don't know what you mean--
this is confusing!

16:42.815 --> 16:44.731
- I know.
- You say that you know,

16:44.815 --> 16:46.773
but I don't know
what you mean!

16:46.857 --> 16:48.815
- Why does there only
have to be two?!
- Elle-- Elle--

16:48.898 --> 16:52.148
Why can't there be three of us
like it used to?!

16:52.231 --> 16:55.439
- It's not fair!
It's not fucking fair!
- Honey!

16:55.523 --> 16:58.023
- Everybody else
has their whole family!
- I know they do.

16:58.107 --> 16:59.648
- It's not fair!
- I know, honey. I know.

16:59.731 --> 17:01.314
No! Get off of me!

17:01.398 --> 17:02.982
You're just trying
to make me like you

17:03.065 --> 17:05.065
so I'll choose you
and let you live!

17:05.189 --> 17:08.398
Oh, my God,
are you both  pretending
to like Harry Potter?

17:08.481 --> 17:10.023
No, we're not pretending,
Elle, OK?

17:10.107 --> 17:13.523
- Oh, my God! It's not fair!
- Elle, stop it.

17:13.606 --> 17:15.023
- It's not fair!
- Stop it!

17:15.107 --> 17:16.273
I know it's not fair.
I know it's--

17:16.356 --> 17:20.314
( Elle shrieking )

17:25.648 --> 17:28.481
( panting )

17:42.815 --> 17:44.815
It's not fair.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.815
I just wish
it didn't have to be two.

17:47.898 --> 17:51.231
Just wish it could be three,
together again.

18:01.898 --> 18:04.107
Elle.

18:04.189 --> 18:07.648
I know that
this is incredibly hard.

18:07.731 --> 18:12.898
And I know that you think
that I don't understand
how you're feeling

18:12.982 --> 18:16.148
because you and Dad
were so close.

18:17.314 --> 18:19.815
But you know, your Dad and I

18:19.898 --> 18:22.523
also had a very
special connection.

18:26.231 --> 18:27.731
You did?

18:29.439 --> 18:31.148
Of course.

18:32.439 --> 18:34.356
He was my husband

18:34.439 --> 18:37.731
and my best friend
in the whole world.

18:37.815 --> 18:40.690
And we had our own set
of secret worlds

18:40.773 --> 18:44.023
and things that only we shared.

18:44.107 --> 18:49.231
And now I feel like I've lost
this piece of myself...

18:51.107 --> 18:53.731
...and I can never be the same.

18:54.815 --> 18:58.189
That's exactly how I feel.

18:58.273 --> 18:59.815
I know.

19:02.606 --> 19:04.690
I'm sorry.

19:06.773 --> 19:08.982
It's OK.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.606
I love you so much, honey.

19:26.648 --> 19:28.648
( Elle whispering )

19:51.690 --> 19:54.940
- ( whispering )
But will Mom and I be OK?
- Elle.

19:55.023 --> 19:56.398
Hold on, Mom.

19:56.481 --> 19:59.065
I'm saying goodbye to Dad.

20:04.565 --> 20:06.398
( whispering )
I think about you
all the time,

20:06.481 --> 20:10.439
and I dream we'll be
together forever.

20:14.148 --> 20:17.314
OK, Dad. Goodbye.

20:17.398 --> 20:19.148
I love you.

20:21.857 --> 20:24.189
Man:
I love you too.

20:29.982 --> 20:31.940
( music playing )

21:31.189 --> 21:32.648
Where shall we begin, Charles?

21:33.606 --> 21:38.023
Good question. That depends
on... how much time we have.

21:38.107 --> 21:39.648
I've rented the room
for three days.

21:40.606 --> 21:42.565
(LAUGHS)

21:43.189 --> 21:44.439
That wasn't a joke.
