00:33.092 --> 00:34.510
Thank you.

00:44.395 --> 00:46.564
Read it to me, please.

00:49.275 --> 00:52.195
"Scorpio, not like you to be lazy,

00:52.445 --> 00:55.323
"but today it is an
effort to exert yourself.

00:55.406 --> 00:57.784
"Best to turn your attention
to anything new,

00:57.867 --> 00:59.410
"as this will be a stimulant.

00:59.702 --> 01:01.746
"Don't take a partner for granted."

01:06.918 --> 01:08.586
Here's what I want packed.

01:09.420 --> 01:10.922
The list of my

01:12.215 --> 01:13.633
accessories.

01:18.388 --> 01:20.431
Idiot! That one's at the cleaners.

01:50.628 --> 01:53.631
<i>Modesty.</i>

01:54.006 --> 01:57.927
<i>Modesty.</i>

01:58.010 --> 02:01.597
<i>She is the shadow
on your bedroom wall.</i>

02:01.681 --> 02:05.017
<i>She is the dream you never found.</i>

02:05.184 --> 02:08.812
<i>But then you find
no time to dream at all.</i>

02:08.937 --> 02:12.233
<i>Whenever Modesty's around.</i>

02:12.316 --> 02:15.695
<i>Modesty.</i>

02:15.778 --> 02:19.615
<i>Modesty.</i>

02:19.782 --> 02:23.411
<i>She'll strike you dumb
with just a single glance.</i>

02:23.494 --> 02:26.748
<i>Or just</i> a <i>single glancing blow.</i>

02:26.998 --> 02:30.668
<i>Exactly why she slays so many men.</i>

02:30.752 --> 02:33.963
<i>No man alive will ever know.</i>

02:34.130 --> 02:37.508
<i>Modesty.</i>

02:37.675 --> 02:40.678
<i>Modesty.</i>

02:40.845 --> 02:43.347
<i>She'll turn your head.</i>

02:43.473 --> 02:48.102
<i>Though she might use a judo hold.</i>

02:48.269 --> 02:51.147
<i>And on her shoulders.</i>

02:51.230 --> 02:55.568
<i>A chip made of solid gold.</i>

02:56.235 --> 02:59.739
<i>If you're a master of the underworld.</i>

02:59.822 --> 03:03.409
<i>You'll be accepted in her queue.</i>

03:03.576 --> 03:07.163
<i>She is the perfect mistress of her art.</i>

03:07.246 --> 03:10.625
<i>She is the perfect mistress too.</i>

03:10.708 --> 03:14.253
<i>Modesty.</i>

03:14.712 --> 03:18.257
<i>Modesty.</i>

04:41.549 --> 04:43.551
<i>Modesty Blaise?</i>

04:43.801 --> 04:46.971
<i>Why on earth do we need Modesty Blaise?</i>

04:47.138 --> 04:49.640
<i>We have our very best man on the job.</i>

05:23.382 --> 05:26.093
Dear me. That's bad luck.

05:26.886 --> 05:29.347
No use crying over spilt milk.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.557
The diamonds must be got
through to the sheik.

05:31.641 --> 05:33.100
Hear! Hear!

05:33.184 --> 05:34.560
Hear! Hear!

05:38.522 --> 05:43.361
We've no alternative.
We must have Modesty Blaise.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.321
With your permission, sir,

05:45.488 --> 05:48.366
a massive military maneuver
to impress the enemy.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.617
Hear! Hear!

05:49.700 --> 05:51.285
Hear! Hear!

05:51.827 --> 05:54.538
Fine. You don't even know
who the enemy is.

05:54.705 --> 05:57.291
And if the wrong people heard about it,

05:57.541 --> 05:58.793
the sheik would lose his head.

05:58.876 --> 06:00.670
We'll lose the oil concession.

06:03.089 --> 06:07.927
<i>Tenant, who was that young person
that you suggested'?</i>

06:08.844 --> 06:11.013
The young lady's name, Minister,

06:11.514 --> 06:12.890
is Modesty Blaise.

06:14.266 --> 06:16.602
Use a thief to catch a thief.

06:18.062 --> 06:20.356
<i>You won't be able to persuade her, Tarrant.</i>

06:20.564 --> 06:23.401
<i>She's retired, with a large fortune</i>

06:23.776 --> 06:25.903
<i>and planning to get married.</i>

06:35.371 --> 06:37.707
David will never forgive me for this.

06:38.582 --> 06:40.001
You're fond of him?

06:41.085 --> 06:43.045
He's the sort of man I could marry.

06:43.796 --> 06:46.590
Modesty Blaise,
somebody's private property?

06:46.882 --> 06:48.175
Never.

06:55.307 --> 06:56.851
You appreciate, Miss Blez...

06:57.018 --> 06:58.436
Blaise, sir.

06:58.561 --> 07:01.439
Blaise, that what you are seeing
is top-secret.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.733
That is the kingdom of Casara...

07:03.899 --> 07:05.276
Masara, sir.

07:06.235 --> 07:08.070
Scarcely large enough to be on the map.

07:08.154 --> 07:10.614
About the size of England and Wales.

07:11.365 --> 07:13.743
We turned everything over
to the natives ten...

07:13.826 --> 07:16.495
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen years ago.

07:16.787 --> 07:19.582
Since then, of course,
the place has gone to seed.

07:32.762 --> 07:34.805
The revolution,
led by the sheik's first cousin...

07:34.972 --> 07:36.474
- Second cousin.
- Second cousin.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.809
A man who claims to be a trade unionist.

07:39.268 --> 07:40.644
Right-wing, of course.

07:44.690 --> 07:46.108
That's the sheik himself.

07:46.525 --> 07:48.861
Retired cutthroat called Abu Tahir.

07:49.111 --> 07:50.362
I know him well.

07:50.529 --> 07:51.739
DO you?

07:56.786 --> 07:58.496
What do you want me to do?

08:01.499 --> 08:02.750
For practical purposes,

08:02.833 --> 08:05.920
Abu Tahir is a democrat
and we support him.

08:06.504 --> 08:08.714
In exchange for a small oil concession,

08:08.798 --> 08:11.258
we are sending him a small contribution.

08:11.634 --> 08:13.177
You have very pretty ears.

08:14.553 --> 08:16.097
What sort of contribution?

08:18.099 --> 08:20.601
Fifty thousand pounds in diamonds.

08:20.684 --> 08:21.769
Millions, Minister.

08:21.852 --> 08:23.270
Millions, millions.

08:24.814 --> 08:26.482
Who's trying to stop the shipment?

08:26.774 --> 08:28.776
That is what we want you to find out.

08:29.193 --> 08:30.778
It should be easy for you

08:30.861 --> 08:33.489
with your connections
in the world of crime.

08:33.823 --> 08:35.533
- Adventure, surely.
- Adventure.

08:37.659 --> 08:39.160
If I help you,

08:39.495 --> 08:41.246
you will trust me completely.

08:41.871 --> 08:43.541
You'll give me all the information.

08:44.207 --> 08:45.543
Every bit, of course.

08:46.293 --> 08:47.711
If you deceive me,

08:49.088 --> 08:50.881
I may take your diamonds.

09:07.148 --> 09:09.608
I take my fee in Swiss Francs in advance,

09:11.735 --> 09:13.028
and I want Willie Garvin.

09:13.112 --> 09:14.905
- Who's Willie Garvin?
- No, Modesty.

09:15.239 --> 09:16.323
Who's Willie Garvin?

09:16.407 --> 09:18.242
I won't do it without Willie.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.036
We've already checked on your Willie.

09:21.537 --> 09:24.248
If you're prepared to transport
yourself to South America,

09:24.331 --> 09:26.292
cross two rivers full of alligators,

09:26.584 --> 09:28.419
hack your way through a jungle,

09:28.752 --> 09:31.130
and then seduce a military governor,

09:31.255 --> 09:33.757
well, perhaps.

09:53.110 --> 09:55.029
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, Willie.</i>

09:55.154 --> 09:56.447
Princess.

09:56.780 --> 09:57.865
Don't go away, love.

09:57.948 --> 10:00.910
<i>I am talking to a man who says
you are in South America.</i>

10:01.076 --> 10:02.453
For you, I've just come back.

10:02.912 --> 10:04.288
Doing anything, Willie?

10:07.917 --> 10:09.793
Near nothing as makes no difference.

10:10.669 --> 10:12.046
Let go.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.839
Where is the fire, princess?

10:14.548 --> 10:15.799
<i>Are you free?</i>

10:15.883 --> 10:18.010
As a bird. What makes you think different?

10:18.177 --> 10:19.762
<i>I thought you spoke to someone.</i>

10:20.638 --> 10:21.764
Only to you.

10:21.847 --> 10:22.973
<i>Can you come now?</i>

10:23.140 --> 10:24.934
Now, yesterday, tomorrow.

10:25.017 --> 10:26.268
You name it.

10:26.435 --> 10:27.645
<i>NOW, Willie.</i>

10:28.479 --> 10:30.356
<i>I want you to come now.</i>

10:30.731 --> 10:32.816
'Course. I'm chuffed, princess.

10:33.108 --> 10:35.444
I hate lying about, don't I?

10:36.487 --> 10:38.030
NOW? Why not?

10:40.658 --> 10:41.742
Bye!

11:08.978 --> 11:11.230
I don't know how much
you know about Arab etiquette,

11:11.313 --> 11:14.358
but the one thing to avoid
above all is familiarity.

11:15.150 --> 11:17.194
These chaps are as proud as Lucifer,

11:17.695 --> 11:21.240
and a woman amongst Muslims
has to be particularly careful.

11:22.283 --> 11:23.701
- Wham!
- Bam!

11:23.784 --> 11:24.868
Thank you, ma'am!

11:33.711 --> 11:35.879
- Sir George.
- Sir Gerald.

11:36.463 --> 11:39.717
It is the Muslims who must be
careful with Modesty Blaise.

11:45.681 --> 11:47.725
<i>Apres vous, Sir Gerald.</i>

11:55.357 --> 11:56.650
He is here.

11:57.234 --> 11:59.987
My son Modesty, who is also my daughter.

12:03.073 --> 12:05.200
I might have known you two
would know each other.

12:05.284 --> 12:07.578
Know each other? She is my son.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.122
There must have been
a technical problem or two.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.250
Faith, Sir Gerald, can move mountains.

12:14.460 --> 12:16.879
These are the sons of my body.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.229
Sir Gerald.

12:35.647 --> 12:38.567
Once upon a time,
a little girl comes to Masara,

12:38.650 --> 12:40.611
all bones and eyes,

12:40.694 --> 12:42.946
fierce and proud, like a...

12:43.781 --> 12:45.032
Like a...

12:45.157 --> 12:46.367
Eaglet.

12:46.575 --> 12:48.702
With claws like so.

12:49.411 --> 12:51.538
Too fierce to be a daughter.

12:51.622 --> 12:54.458
He made me his son
and taught me how to fight.

12:56.168 --> 12:58.462
After our country got independence,

12:58.712 --> 13:00.839
a couple of idiot relatives of mine

13:01.048 --> 13:04.343
decided to move in and take over things.

13:05.302 --> 13:07.054
Naturally, I sent for Modesty.

13:07.221 --> 13:09.598
She came like a shot with Willie Garvin.

13:09.723 --> 13:11.141
What a character!

13:12.476 --> 13:13.727
Terrific guy!

13:22.152 --> 13:24.196
We must take you
grouse shooting this autumn.

13:28.951 --> 13:30.786
A little present for you, my son.

13:30.994 --> 13:32.204
For me?

13:32.413 --> 13:34.289
It will help you in your work.

13:42.548 --> 13:45.008
The most beautiful thing I've ever seen!

13:45.134 --> 13:47.553
It's not functional, of course?

14:02.484 --> 14:03.902
No, no, no! Don't, please!

14:03.986 --> 14:06.822
It's pointing directly
at Buckingham Palace!

14:09.867 --> 14:12.536
Come, Modesty.
We'll try the other window.

14:13.036 --> 14:14.705
There's a better view from there.

14:28.260 --> 14:29.470
We're alone.

14:31.263 --> 14:32.681
Modesty,

14:33.474 --> 14:35.976
who is the enemy?

14:37.144 --> 14:38.520
I don't know yet.

14:43.066 --> 14:47.362
There's only one man who would
dare to steal from Abu Tahir.

14:48.614 --> 14:50.616
<i>But Gabriel is dead.</i>

15:21.772 --> 15:23.649
He's home, Mr. McWhirter.

15:25.442 --> 15:26.818
On time, as usual.

15:30.113 --> 15:32.783
McWhirter speaking. McWhirter speaking.

15:33.617 --> 15:35.244
He is home.

15:35.827 --> 15:37.454
<i>He is home.</i>

17:20.140 --> 17:22.059
Dear Clara Fothergill.

17:23.060 --> 17:25.354
Three and four.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.397
One and two

17:28.732 --> 17:31.568
and three and four.

17:32.069 --> 17:34.237
One and two

17:34.529 --> 17:37.908
and three and four!

17:40.327 --> 17:41.453
You may rest.

17:41.662 --> 17:43.205
It's your own fault, Basilio.

17:43.288 --> 17:44.665
You eat too much.

17:45.207 --> 17:46.416
Weakling!

17:52.089 --> 17:53.674
Glad to have you back, Mr. Gabriel.

17:53.757 --> 17:55.425
- How was the trip?
- Tedious.

17:55.884 --> 17:57.386
London was lucrative,

17:57.803 --> 18:01.640
but Scotland remains the bastion
of bonny-bred bluebell boredom.

18:33.964 --> 18:35.882
We were nine for dinner.

18:37.676 --> 18:39.052
A criminologist,

18:41.638 --> 18:44.474
rather overeager,
with a floral tie and dandruff.

18:46.643 --> 18:48.311
We talked about Gabriel.

18:49.521 --> 18:52.482
He said that Gabriel had
the only true criminal mind.

18:53.984 --> 18:56.486
His only motive was malice.

18:57.779 --> 18:58.989
Rather unkind.

18:59.698 --> 19:03.160
Mamma was most amused
and very condescending to me, as usual.

19:04.161 --> 19:08.081
You know, McWhirter, one of these days
I shall have to tell her who I am.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.209
We've got the clown
who tried to betray us.

19:11.543 --> 19:13.962
Betray? We use overdramatic language.

19:14.337 --> 19:16.590
"Gave us away" is quite enough.

19:17.340 --> 19:18.508
<i>Who do you mean, (Brewer?</i>

19:19.426 --> 19:21.678
He arrived air freight from Amsterdam.

19:22.304 --> 19:23.430
COD.

19:23.513 --> 19:24.681
<i>Poor (Brewer.</i>

19:25.766 --> 19:28.351
He suffers quite frightfully from cramp.

19:32.522 --> 19:34.065
How delightful!

19:36.610 --> 19:38.528
Enter Mrs. Fothergill.

19:39.738 --> 19:41.364
Well, it's about time.

19:42.199 --> 19:43.492
How are your tiny ones?

19:43.950 --> 19:45.577
Not in shape, I fear.

19:45.911 --> 19:48.205
Basilio manufactures carbohydrates!

19:49.456 --> 19:52.209
Gabriel, you promised me Crevier.

19:53.210 --> 19:54.544
That clown!

19:55.879 --> 19:57.088
You promised!

19:57.714 --> 19:59.549
You practically promised.

20:06.056 --> 20:08.892
Now, you know I don't understand
a word of your French.

20:13.897 --> 20:16.399
Mrs. Fothergill has been restless
in your absence, sir.

20:16.525 --> 20:18.235
With the full moon, I fear for me life.

20:18.693 --> 20:19.973
Quite without reason, McWhirter.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.822
She wouldn't waste her energies on you.

20:22.447 --> 20:24.324
Have you worked out the latest figures?

20:26.952 --> 20:29.204
The books look just fine at the moment.

20:29.746 --> 20:33.667
Then I should allow a separate
contingency of £50,000.

20:34.543 --> 20:35.669
What for?

20:35.752 --> 20:36.920
Modesty Blaise.

20:38.797 --> 20:40.131
Is she with us?

20:40.590 --> 20:41.883
No, alas.

20:42.634 --> 20:44.970
Against us once again.

20:49.266 --> 20:51.434
The totals for the month
are rather below average.

20:52.060 --> 20:54.020
On the other hand,
the accounts for your trip

20:54.104 --> 20:55.438
are rather disquieting.

20:55.605 --> 20:58.525
For example, sex in June, £30,000.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.694
You've no sense of the true
value of money, McWhirter.

21:00.777 --> 21:02.988
Nevertheless, it all affects
the final balance sheet.

21:06.658 --> 21:08.098
I'm happy to say, on the other hand,

21:08.118 --> 21:11.413
that the total for death in the same period
is only £2, 17 and sixpence.

21:12.330 --> 21:13.373
Crevier not included.

21:13.498 --> 21:14.583
Yet.

21:30.098 --> 21:31.266
You're not concentrating, McWhirter.

21:31.349 --> 21:32.809
Come sit here in this chair.

21:37.355 --> 21:39.441
How did you explain Crevier to the friar?

21:40.233 --> 21:42.903
I told him he was an atomic scientist

21:43.111 --> 21:45.697
caught selling secrets in the public loo,

21:46.156 --> 21:47.532
in the Piazza di Spagna.

21:48.158 --> 21:49.326
Did he believe you?

21:49.951 --> 21:51.661
He said he wasn't born yesterday.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.875
If I may quote Merritt and Sykes...

21:57.375 --> 21:58.668
Must you?

22:00.629 --> 22:04.341
"Faulty financial analysis
is a very common occurrence."

22:07.010 --> 22:09.095
"Where the financial implications
of a project

22:10.347 --> 22:12.098
"have not been fully thought out,

22:13.391 --> 22:15.268
"some items in the investment

22:17.938 --> 22:20.357
"or some of the cash advantages

22:21.107 --> 22:22.525
"may have been omitted."

22:23.026 --> 22:24.319
Carry on, McWhirter.

22:25.904 --> 22:28.224
"Or the financial analysis
may have been performed in a way

22:28.365 --> 22:31.868
"that arbitrarily presents projects
in an unjustifiably attractive

22:32.744 --> 22:34.204
"or unattractive way."

22:51.721 --> 22:55.392
"This is inevitably the consequence
of using crude methods,

22:56.518 --> 22:57.644
"such as the payback."

23:27.465 --> 23:28.591
If you knock down the value
of the diamonds

23:28.717 --> 23:30.468
by another million or two in disposal,

23:31.094 --> 23:32.415
it will leave your profit only...

23:32.470 --> 23:33.930
We're not in this for the money.

23:34.347 --> 23:35.598
Then what, may I ask, are...

23:38.393 --> 23:39.561
Dear Clara.

23:42.480 --> 23:45.358
Have you ever wondered
about Mr. Fothergill?

23:48.695 --> 23:50.280
I am Mr. Fothergill.

24:43.041 --> 24:45.502
This is the tallest building in Amsterdam.

24:45.877 --> 24:47.378
I hope you enjoy your visit.

24:58.181 --> 25:01.351
I'm looking forward to meeting
this Modesty Blaise.

25:04.646 --> 25:06.106
You warned immigration, of course.

25:06.189 --> 25:08.775
Yes. She's not very popular with them.

25:10.068 --> 25:11.444
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

25:34.342 --> 25:37.679
<i>What on earth is Modesty Blaise
doing in Rotterdam, Tarrant?</i>

25:37.762 --> 25:40.390
<i>- Amsterdam, Minister.
- Amster... Rotter...</i>

25:40.598 --> 25:43.685
<i>She's a decoy, Minister, a decoy.</i>

26:02.495 --> 26:03.621
Honolulu.

26:09.043 --> 26:10.753
The Maharajah's snuffbox.

26:17.051 --> 26:18.094
Dublin.

26:20.930 --> 26:22.140
Murder.

26:55.798 --> 26:58.676
<i>Well, Tarrant.
Now, what on earth is Modesty Blaise</i>

26:58.760 --> 27:00.303
<i>doing on a canal boat?</i>

27:00.762 --> 27:02.931
<i>Our new man is making contact</i>

27:03.056 --> 27:06.434
<i>through a mysterious third party, Minister.</i>

27:17.820 --> 27:22.033
<i>Does she know that the diamonds
are really on the Tyboria, Tarrant?</i>

27:22.158 --> 27:23.660
<i>No, Minister.</i>

27:23.910 --> 27:27.330
<i>We don't trust her. We merely use her.</i>

27:29.082 --> 27:31.000
<i>"If you deceive me.</i>

27:31.125 --> 27:32.961
<i>"I may take your diamonds."</i>

27:34.754 --> 27:39.342
<i>And in front of you here,
you'll see ships from all over the world.</i>

27:42.136 --> 27:44.430
<i>Tyboria, port of London,</i>

27:44.847 --> 27:46.975
<i>Lisbon, Catania, Beirut.</i>

29:24.238 --> 29:25.490
I'm sorry about the explosion, madam.

29:25.615 --> 29:26.908
It doesn't happen every day.

29:26.991 --> 29:28.618
I don't come every day.

29:28.993 --> 29:30.953
Perhaps you will recommend us
to your friends.

29:33.373 --> 29:34.874
Maybe.

29:53.559 --> 29:56.145
<i>74 Haarlemmerstraat, apartment C.</i>

29:59.732 --> 30:01.901
<i>Tarrant, did you warn Miss Blaise</i>

30:01.984 --> 30:04.320
<i>about pushing doorbells in Amsterdam?</i>

30:05.154 --> 30:06.155
<i>Good heavens!</i>

32:54.240 --> 32:55.449
Pacco.

32:57.535 --> 32:58.828
No.

33:00.746 --> 33:01.998
Willie Garvin?

33:12.800 --> 33:14.135
Thank you.

33:14.677 --> 33:15.678
There you go.

33:23.477 --> 33:26.314
<i>What on earth
is Willie Garvin doing, Tarrant?</i>

33:26.522 --> 33:28.107
<i>Collecting canaries.</i>

33:28.190 --> 33:29.442
<i>Canaries?</i>

33:29.692 --> 33:31.527
<i>Criminal slang, Minister.</i>

33:31.944 --> 33:34.363
<i>Canaries are birds that sing.</i>

33:34.739 --> 33:37.408
<i>- Birds are...
- Never mind. Never mind!</i>

33:42.663 --> 33:45.041
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.</i>

34:00.222 --> 34:02.558
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to introduce

34:02.725 --> 34:05.353
the charming, the beautiful,

34:06.562 --> 34:07.730
Nicole!

34:59.281 --> 35:00.533
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:00.616 --> 35:02.284
now I'm going to introduce to you

35:02.368 --> 35:04.578
the best trick of the 20th century.

35:28.561 --> 35:30.938
- How's it going, love?
- Willie.

35:31.021 --> 35:33.399
Come and tell me later.
I'm at 6 Boomstraat.

37:04.490 --> 37:05.825
Jacquelyn?

37:07.993 --> 37:09.411
That's not bloody funny.

37:10.412 --> 37:11.664
What are you doing here?

37:20.297 --> 37:21.549
No.

37:22.299 --> 37:24.134
It's Modesty Blaise.

37:25.970 --> 37:28.264
Jacquelyn, you're not Modesty Blaise?

37:29.139 --> 37:30.766
I thought you'd be pleased.

37:31.267 --> 37:32.643
After Paris?

37:33.269 --> 37:35.437
We weren't on the same side then.

37:36.438 --> 37:37.606
Are we now?

37:37.731 --> 37:39.900
Paris was a long time ago.

37:41.068 --> 37:42.278
Only three years.

37:42.361 --> 37:43.487
Only?

37:43.654 --> 37:45.614
Three years, two months,

37:45.698 --> 37:49.201
four days, and 25 minutes.

37:50.119 --> 37:53.497
You two-faced, cold-blooded, calculating...

37:53.581 --> 37:56.792
Not cold-blooded, please.

37:58.502 --> 38:00.129
Well, who cares?

38:00.754 --> 38:02.590
Okay, then, Modesty Blaise.

38:02.882 --> 38:04.443
What the hell did you do to the lights?

38:05.509 --> 38:07.386
Nothing. I thought...

38:23.611 --> 38:27.364
Even in our world fuses have been known
to blow from natural causes.

38:29.658 --> 38:30.993
Jacquelyn.

38:31.994 --> 38:33.203
Modesty.

38:35.164 --> 38:38.125
Were you deceiving me
all the time in Paris?

38:40.377 --> 38:43.297
Do you think I can control my heartbeats?

38:47.217 --> 38:48.761
Quite probably.

38:54.475 --> 38:56.185
I ought to strangle you.

38:56.352 --> 38:57.394
Try.

39:07.947 --> 39:09.323
How do you get it off?

39:20.709 --> 39:24.296
<i>So is this bird about to talk?</i>

39:24.380 --> 39:26.840
<i>Canary about to sing, Minister.</i>

39:26.924 --> 39:30.135
<i>Well, Garvin is working
on that assumption.</i>

39:30.260 --> 39:33.305
<i>I hope it is not her swan song.</i>

39:34.223 --> 39:36.225
<i>Very sinister, Minister.</i>

39:41.939 --> 39:43.148
Now, how did you get it on?

39:49.071 --> 39:51.824
How are you sending the diamonds?

39:52.658 --> 39:56.453
By RAF aircraft from Schiphol
at 10:00 tomorrow night.

39:58.580 --> 40:01.458
Sounds like a very good plan.

40:01.959 --> 40:03.335
Rm glad you approve.

40:04.795 --> 40:06.046
Modesty.

40:07.965 --> 40:10.342
Where did you go that last day in Paris

40:10.426 --> 40:13.053
when you said you were
going to Balenciaga?

40:16.098 --> 40:17.433
Christian Dior.

40:19.143 --> 40:20.686
Where did you go that day in Rome

40:20.769 --> 40:22.771
when you told me you were going to Rio?

40:29.445 --> 40:30.738
Buenos Aires.

40:31.905 --> 40:33.365
You're so cruel.

40:33.490 --> 40:35.409
Who does Pacco take his orders from?

40:35.492 --> 40:36.744
I don't know.

40:36.827 --> 40:37.953
A bird.

40:39.747 --> 40:40.956
You're so cruel.

40:41.248 --> 40:42.833
Cruel? I haven't touched you yet.

40:45.127 --> 40:46.295
No.

40:52.468 --> 40:53.677
<i>Fothergill speaking.</i>

40:54.136 --> 40:55.471
<i>Fothergill speaking.</i>

40:55.804 --> 40:56.889
<i>Fothergill speaking.</i>

40:56.972 --> 40:59.600
<i>Fothergill speaking. Fothergill speaking.</i>

40:59.683 --> 41:01.643
Tell Gabriel to get out of bed.

41:01.852 --> 41:03.562
Modesty's in bed with Englishman.

41:03.812 --> 41:05.397
Willie is in bed with Nicole.

41:15.324 --> 41:16.825
What makes you think so?

41:17.242 --> 41:18.410
Gabriel's dead.

41:19.036 --> 41:20.245
Did you see the body?

41:20.913 --> 41:23.082
If you say it's Gabriel, then it's Gabriel.

41:23.332 --> 41:24.666
Woman's intuition.

41:30.339 --> 41:33.050
All I said was "woman's intuition."
What's the matter with that?

41:39.223 --> 41:41.517
Now, stop acting like
a bloody-minded female!

41:44.061 --> 41:46.230
Okay, it was Gabriel! It was Gabriel!

41:46.396 --> 41:48.857
It was Gabriel! It was Gabriel!

41:57.157 --> 41:58.700
It was Gabriel!

42:08.043 --> 42:10.712
Now I'm hungry.

42:11.171 --> 42:12.548
You peasant.

42:13.340 --> 42:15.467
All right. I'll see what I can find.

42:47.624 --> 42:48.876
Modesty Blaise?

42:59.344 --> 43:00.554
- Pacco here.
- Yes.

43:00.637 --> 43:02.097
We have got Modesty Blaise.

43:03.056 --> 43:04.224
<i>Well done.</i>

43:05.851 --> 43:07.269
<i>Five minutes late, Pacco.</i>

43:07.519 --> 43:08.729
You want Garvin?

43:08.937 --> 43:11.023
<i>Are you still under budget?</i>

43:11.440 --> 43:13.358
<i>If you haven't got them both,
you haven't got either.</i>

43:13.442 --> 43:14.902
<i>You're a fool, Pacco.</i>

43:20.073 --> 43:21.325
Come on.

43:26.622 --> 43:28.248
So you'll ask him over'?

43:29.208 --> 43:30.709
You're giving the party.

43:33.128 --> 43:34.504
We catch them

43:35.464 --> 43:37.382
and that Fothergill woman,

43:38.217 --> 43:39.593
catch the fun.

43:45.390 --> 43:47.309
She knows. She always knows.

43:47.392 --> 43:48.977
She's got an instinct for it.

43:49.728 --> 43:50.938
Hello, princess.

43:51.146 --> 43:52.481
<i>I need you here, Willie.</i>

43:52.606 --> 43:55.067
She needs me here and all. Where are you?

43:55.984 --> 43:58.779
Haarlemmerstraat, 74.

44:00.822 --> 44:02.241
Apartment C.

44:03.033 --> 44:04.201
Apartment C.

44:04.284 --> 44:06.745
It can't wait about 15 minutes, can it?

44:06.912 --> 44:08.622
<i>No. Now.</i>

44:23.178 --> 44:25.222
Hey, will you stop that?

44:29.059 --> 44:31.812
Listen, what about tomorrow?

44:32.229 --> 44:33.814
- Not here.
- Where?

44:35.232 --> 44:37.234
I don't know. Anywhere.

44:41.947 --> 44:43.198
The old market.

44:44.157 --> 44:45.367
Doll's House.

44:48.203 --> 44:49.538
Now, listen.

44:50.080 --> 44:51.873
Get Pacco talking, okay?

44:52.374 --> 44:55.711
Twist him around them little pins of yours
and keep him spinning.

44:57.045 --> 44:58.422
Just like you do with me.

45:01.508 --> 45:03.010
Don't let it get cold.

45:52.434 --> 45:53.935
Hello, Garvin.

45:55.062 --> 45:56.313
Are you buying or selling?

45:56.438 --> 45:57.898
I'm giving it away, actually.

45:57.981 --> 45:59.149
Like you'd have to.

45:59.274 --> 46:01.693
Garvin, that car's been over there

46:01.777 --> 46:03.612
for 10 minutes with its engine running.

46:14.706 --> 46:15.916
Garvin.

47:10.637 --> 47:12.097
Good morning.

47:13.056 --> 47:14.391
Good morning.

47:27.863 --> 47:31.074
I say, Garvin, that was a bloody
close shave if you'd been late.

47:31.199 --> 47:33.118
Yeah, well, somebody had to take a chance

47:33.285 --> 47:34.578
and I'm chicken.

47:34.870 --> 47:36.872
Well, that's well-known, isn't it?

48:26.254 --> 48:28.256
Faith, hope, and charity.

48:28.798 --> 48:30.425
The wages of sin.

48:35.263 --> 48:36.848
Well, at least we're keeping her busy.

48:36.973 --> 48:39.476
But you must decide what to do
about Pacco's girl, Nicole.

48:39.601 --> 48:40.922
What have I done to deserve this?

48:40.936 --> 48:44.606
Everyone in my organization behaves
as if she was Mata Hari or something.

48:45.524 --> 48:47.234
He asks for instructions.

48:48.944 --> 48:50.487
It's too expensive.

48:51.279 --> 48:53.657
Is he making the decisions now?

48:58.954 --> 49:00.288
No, Clara.

49:01.456 --> 49:02.457
No.

49:05.877 --> 49:09.214
You know, McWhirter, that woman
has no sense of the value of human life.

49:13.969 --> 49:15.470
<i>Buongiorno, Fidello.</i>

49:20.934 --> 49:22.143
Good morning.

49:30.485 --> 49:31.695
McWhirter,

49:32.404 --> 49:33.822
take a letter to Pacco.

49:36.491 --> 49:37.826
My dear Pacco,

49:40.161 --> 49:43.331
the few of us who are responsible

49:44.416 --> 49:46.126
for the lives of so many,

49:47.335 --> 49:49.129
bear a very heavy burden.

49:50.338 --> 49:51.673
No. Carry a great weight.

49:52.507 --> 49:55.427
A good general weeps

49:56.428 --> 49:59.723
when he is forced to send
his troops into action.

50:00.432 --> 50:03.101
And the tears of the widows...

50:04.519 --> 50:05.854
Widows and orphans.

50:06.813 --> 50:09.065
And the tears of the widows and orphans

50:10.483 --> 50:12.193
are his tears too.

50:16.281 --> 50:17.490
Lost the thread.

50:17.741 --> 50:19.117
- Nicole.
- Yeah.

50:19.451 --> 50:20.660
Send a cable.

50:20.827 --> 50:22.037
Dear Pacco,

50:22.162 --> 50:25.081
if the girl is alive tomorrow night,
you won't be.

50:25.415 --> 50:27.626
That's better, and cheaper too.

50:27.792 --> 50:30.337
A bit crude. Let's start again.

50:30.545 --> 50:31.963
Pacco will understand.

50:36.301 --> 50:37.552
I suppose so.

50:39.387 --> 50:40.805
He reads the comic strips.

53:04.073 --> 53:05.700
No!

53:16.669 --> 53:17.796
Let me see.

53:18.880 --> 53:20.340
It hurts.

53:21.674 --> 53:23.176
Tell Willie...

53:25.762 --> 53:27.222
Gabriel.

55:11.701 --> 55:14.203
Willie, it's Gabriel.

55:55.954 --> 55:57.538
So far, so good.

55:58.289 --> 55:59.958
But no sign of Modesty.

56:00.208 --> 56:02.210
I told her it would be 10:00.

56:02.377 --> 56:05.880
She's not the sort
who can resist temptation.

56:06.130 --> 56:07.715
You should know.

56:13.888 --> 56:16.724
Are you afraid she'd steal
those empty boxes?

56:55.972 --> 56:57.348
Do you ski?

56:58.391 --> 56:59.434
No.

56:59.559 --> 57:00.768
DO you?

57:01.269 --> 57:02.311
No.

57:04.856 --> 57:07.233
G-control. Bravo Foxtrot.

57:08.943 --> 57:11.279
<i>G-control. Bravo Foxtrot.</i>

57:12.113 --> 57:13.948
G-control receiving you.

57:14.615 --> 57:17.785
<i>We are now in jet-stream conditions
at 50,000 feet.</i>

57:18.119 --> 57:20.955
<i>Estimate Beirut,
in two and a half hours' time.</i>

57:26.127 --> 57:27.795
The pilot's got a charming voice.

57:28.963 --> 57:31.049
About 35, I should say, wouldn't you?

57:32.467 --> 57:33.634
Any dependents?

57:34.093 --> 57:35.303
Just a wee minute.

57:40.475 --> 57:41.768
Here we are.

57:42.393 --> 57:45.772
Squadron leader Latham of Woking, Surrey.

57:46.606 --> 57:49.776
I very much fear he is married
with two bairns, 6 and 9.

57:49.859 --> 57:51.319
I was afraid of that.

57:51.402 --> 57:52.403
<i>- Strauss!
- Yes, sir.</i>

57:52.487 --> 57:54.947
- Is rocket base Ladino ready?
<i>- Standing by, sir.</i>

57:55.031 --> 57:56.240
Good.

58:10.088 --> 58:11.130
Yes?

58:11.214 --> 58:14.884
Rocket base Ladino
estimates two minutes, 23 seconds.

58:15.093 --> 58:16.094
Thank you.

58:17.678 --> 58:18.846
McWhirter,

58:19.847 --> 58:22.350
the moment I always dread in these cases.

58:24.519 --> 58:25.853
To light the fuse,

58:26.979 --> 58:28.439
to push the button,

58:29.899 --> 58:32.652
to squeeze the trigger.

58:33.694 --> 58:35.571
Such exquisite torture.

58:35.947 --> 58:37.740
We're all relying on you, sir.

58:37.990 --> 58:40.243
Yes, torture.

58:42.703 --> 58:43.913
Strauss!

58:46.249 --> 58:47.291
Sir.

58:47.375 --> 58:49.085
Tell Ladino rocket base,

58:50.086 --> 58:51.129
90!

58:51.212 --> 58:52.380
<i>Jawohl,</i> sir.

58:55.842 --> 58:58.719
Rocket base Ladino, all systems go.

59:05.059 --> 59:06.394
Do you skate?

59:08.020 --> 59:09.188
Skate?

59:11.691 --> 59:14.402
When I was a child
my parents took me tobogganing.

59:24.912 --> 59:26.080
Hello?

59:26.164 --> 59:27.331
Hello?

59:27.790 --> 59:29.333
Do you hear me?

59:29.417 --> 59:30.585
Hello?

59:51.522 --> 59:53.357
A father of two children,

59:53.441 --> 59:55.526
probably with a split-level house in Woking

59:55.943 --> 59:57.612
and a rubber plant in the lounge.

59:57.862 --> 59:58.905
No.

59:59.155 --> 01:00:01.199
Why can't they be bachelors?

01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:03.701
I'll get that bloody
friar for playing scales

01:00:03.784 --> 01:00:05.077
in the middle of the night.

01:00:06.787 --> 01:00:08.581
Sets my Presbyterian teeth on edge.

01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:11.167
Religious intolerance, McWhirter.

01:00:12.126 --> 01:00:15.504
Shouldn't we mourn them
regardless of race or color or creed?

01:00:16.172 --> 01:00:18.883
Rocket base Ladino reports
seeing four parachutes open.

01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.220
How marvelous! Wonderful!

01:00:28.017 --> 01:00:29.143
Why four?

01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:30.937
Those planes carry four.

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:32.605
Well, I didn't know that.

01:00:33.773 --> 01:00:35.483
Tell the friar to play ate deum.

01:00:35.733 --> 01:00:37.235
For what shall I tell him
to give thanks for?

01:00:37.401 --> 01:00:38.945
For me, of course!

01:00:49.622 --> 01:00:50.831
<i>Tyboria.</i>

01:00:52.166 --> 01:00:55.378
Lisbon, Catania, Beirut.

01:00:58.297 --> 01:00:59.840
Well, I couldn't help it.

01:01:03.386 --> 01:01:04.720
Tell me...

01:01:05.221 --> 01:01:09.016
When did you discover
that the plane was a blind?

01:01:10.226 --> 01:01:11.644
Did it work?

01:01:12.103 --> 01:01:13.145
Yes, it did.

01:01:13.229 --> 01:01:17.316
They swallowed the bait
and shot down the plane.

01:01:26.158 --> 01:01:28.411
I'm afraid it's just a little warm.

01:01:56.105 --> 01:01:59.275
I've been watching you, so I trust you.

01:02:37.563 --> 01:02:39.023
Where are you going?

01:02:39.106 --> 01:02:40.191
Bed.

01:02:56.123 --> 01:02:57.583
Modesty, I...

01:02:59.293 --> 01:03:00.628
I don't...

01:03:02.463 --> 01:03:03.756
I mean...

01:03:05.341 --> 01:03:06.592
I can't.

01:03:30.032 --> 01:03:32.368
Thank you, Weng. How is everything?

01:03:32.743 --> 01:03:34.078
All circuits are go-go.

01:03:34.161 --> 01:03:35.242
Very well, miss, thank you.

01:03:35.287 --> 01:03:37.039
Sweet. Sweet, isn't he?

01:03:37.123 --> 01:03:38.207
Yeah.

01:04:03.691 --> 01:04:05.359
"Sorry, darling."

01:04:06.819 --> 01:04:08.028
Modesty.

01:04:08.654 --> 01:04:10.406
"Sorry, darling," it says here.

01:04:10.573 --> 01:04:12.199
"You broke your part of the bargain.

01:04:12.283 --> 01:04:14.452
"L now consider myself a free agent.

01:04:14.535 --> 01:04:15.870
"Modesty."

01:04:25.171 --> 01:04:26.505
She...

01:04:26.881 --> 01:04:28.299
She knows, sir.

01:04:28.382 --> 01:04:30.718
She knows the diamonds
are on the Tyboria.

01:04:31.051 --> 01:04:34.722
Well, we fooled Gabriel and now
we're lumbered with Modesty Blaise.

01:04:35.389 --> 01:04:37.308
Heaven protect my pension.

01:04:38.767 --> 01:04:39.810
Hello.

01:04:53.866 --> 01:04:55.117
Hey.

01:05:09.965 --> 01:05:12.510
We wasted a million
on that wretched rocket.

01:05:13.135 --> 01:05:15.137
One has to do what is expected of one.

01:05:15.262 --> 01:05:17.348
Now we have the advantage of surprise.

01:05:18.307 --> 01:05:20.351
They think we're searching
the Alps for wreckage

01:05:20.434 --> 01:05:22.311
but the diamonds are here,

01:05:22.478 --> 01:05:25.314
in the strong room,
concealed in a crate of porcelain.

01:05:25.439 --> 01:05:27.024
Crown Derby to be exact.

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:29.318
<i>SW, from the Tyboria.</i>

01:05:29.401 --> 01:05:30.945
<i>From the Tyboria?</i>

01:05:31.946 --> 01:05:33.489
<i>Tyboria, Tyboria.</i>

01:05:33.572 --> 01:05:38.285
"Tyboria departed 1520 hours Lisbon. Stop.

01:05:38.827 --> 01:05:40.538
"Modesty Blaise and Willie Garvin

01:05:40.996 --> 01:05:44.458
"overflew 1600 hours approx. Stop."

01:05:46.001 --> 01:05:47.211
Silly dilettante.

01:05:53.801 --> 01:05:55.511
I figure it this way, princess.

01:06:00.182 --> 01:06:01.600
Gabriel's got it figured

01:06:01.684 --> 01:06:04.562
so I figure all we got to do

01:06:04.645 --> 01:06:06.897
is stay close to Gabriel.

01:06:07.481 --> 01:06:09.233
Leave the figuring to me, Willie.

01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:11.235
You might hurt yourself.

01:06:42.808 --> 01:06:43.892
Oleg.

01:06:45.436 --> 01:06:48.188
Can it be that this egg is fertilized?

01:06:53.527 --> 01:06:55.529
I thought so. Take it away, Enrico.

01:06:55.613 --> 01:06:56.947
You have it, McWhirter.

01:06:57.031 --> 01:06:58.782
I'm sure you'd hate to see it wasted.

01:07:07.458 --> 01:07:08.834
Fothergill calling.

01:07:08.917 --> 01:07:10.377
Fothergill calling.

01:07:14.048 --> 01:07:17.176
Fothergill calling. Fothergill calling.

01:07:17.718 --> 01:07:19.011
What is that woman up to now?

01:07:19.094 --> 01:07:21.263
The diving tests for Basilio and Borg.

01:07:23.557 --> 01:07:24.642
Yes, Mrs. Fothergill?

01:07:24.725 --> 01:07:25.976
<i>Basilio's back.</i>

01:07:26.101 --> 01:07:28.562
He is carrying on like
a baby, but he's back.

01:07:28.646 --> 01:07:29.730
And Borg?

01:07:31.523 --> 01:07:33.108
He is down now.

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:40.240
That one.

01:07:40.324 --> 01:07:42.117
No, no. That one.

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:46.080
Decisions, decisions.

01:07:46.163 --> 01:07:47.373
Both!

01:07:51.251 --> 01:07:53.587
Sir, Borg has a weak heart
and Mrs. Fothergill...

01:07:53.962 --> 01:07:55.589
I can't bear to hear them screaming.

01:07:57.424 --> 01:07:59.927
It's a proved fact that
lobsters feel no pain.

01:08:00.761 --> 01:08:02.596
It's just wind escaping.

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.014
Don't be revolting.

01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:45.723
Fothergill calling.

01:08:46.098 --> 01:08:47.640
<i>Yes, Mrs. Fothergill?</i>

01:08:47.725 --> 01:08:49.643
Borg has failed.

01:08:57.067 --> 01:08:59.027
How can I eat lobster

01:08:59.653 --> 01:09:01.279
when the lobsters are eating Borg?

01:09:03.365 --> 01:09:05.158
I shall never forgive myself.

01:09:05.283 --> 01:09:06.827
Take it away, Enrico.

01:09:14.835 --> 01:09:16.670
We can't do it without Borg.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.966
Well, there are two other men
that I would trust

01:09:21.383 --> 01:09:23.093
to crack that strong room.

01:09:23.844 --> 01:09:25.345
Yourself, of course.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:27.514
Myself

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:31.350
and Willie Garvin.

01:09:46.325 --> 01:09:49.703
Here. We now have been through
some scrapes together, have we?

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:52.497
Funny how we always survived, isn't it?

01:09:53.372 --> 01:09:56.001
Survived each other?

01:09:56.376 --> 01:09:58.086
Well, we shared the fights.

01:09:58.212 --> 01:09:59.838
But never shared the nights.

01:09:59.922 --> 01:10:01.423
Perhaps we should have.

01:10:01.715 --> 01:10:02.883
We could have.

01:10:04.259 --> 01:10:06.678
<i>At Covent Garden, il trovatore.</i>

01:10:06.845 --> 01:10:09.223
<i>We were shot at in the stalls.</i>

01:10:09.306 --> 01:10:11.683
<i>They all believed it was in the story.</i>

01:10:11.767 --> 01:10:13.560
<i>And we took nine curtain calls.</i>

01:10:13.644 --> 01:10:15.124
Perhaps eight would have been enough.

01:10:15.145 --> 01:10:17.105
<i>We've shared the thrills.</i>

01:10:17.272 --> 01:10:19.024
<i>We've even shared the kills.</i>

01:10:19.191 --> 01:10:20.943
<i>But such a perfect pair.</i>

01:10:21.068 --> 01:10:23.570
<i>Should surely share a bedroom.</i>

01:10:23.654 --> 01:10:24.822
You know, it's cheaper too.

01:10:24.905 --> 01:10:26.156
It ain't.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.325
<i>The other summer in Arizona.</i>

01:10:28.408 --> 01:10:30.160
<i>I was sentenced to the chair.</i>

01:10:30.285 --> 01:10:32.913
<i>But they didn't realize I knew the owner.</i>

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:35.249
<i>Of the power station there.</i>

01:10:35.374 --> 01:10:40.838
<i>We've bombed and mined
but never intertwined.</i>

01:10:40.921 --> 01:10:42.339
<i>We were crazy.</i>

01:10:42.422 --> 01:10:43.382
You know.

01:10:43.465 --> 01:10:45.133
<i>I was lazy</i>

01:10:45.217 --> 01:10:46.301
I know.

01:10:46.426 --> 01:10:49.429
<i>Yes, we should've, and we could've.</i>

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.348
<i>Perhaps we can.</i>

01:10:54.768 --> 01:10:56.812
If Gabriel doesn't attack us soon

01:10:56.979 --> 01:10:58.438
we'll have to have lunch.

01:10:59.606 --> 01:11:01.441
That's what you really want, isn't it?

01:11:01.817 --> 01:11:03.360
Always the grubstakes.

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:05.988
Hello.

01:11:37.978 --> 01:11:41.481
Here! That constitutes very flash behavior.

01:11:43.358 --> 01:11:44.735
Should we have a laugh?

01:11:44.818 --> 01:11:46.194
We're laughing.

01:12:23.732 --> 01:12:25.400
Need a smoke, any rate.

01:12:26.693 --> 01:12:28.320
They're set for 10 minutes.

01:12:32.491 --> 01:12:33.867
Oh, no. Not you!

01:12:55.263 --> 01:12:57.474
How the devil did you
get a passport, Garvin?

01:12:58.183 --> 01:12:59.935
Just because I'm working-class?

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:01.895
Lower-class you mean, surely.

01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:03.897
- Where are you taking us?
- London.

01:13:03.981 --> 01:13:05.315
Paul, darling.

01:13:05.399 --> 01:13:07.150
Jacquelyn, darling.

01:13:07.776 --> 01:13:09.778
Let us go, and we'll lead you to Gabriel.

01:13:09.861 --> 01:13:13.407
We've played the truth game.
Now we're going to play consequences.

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:14.866
Come along.

01:14:00.370 --> 01:14:03.415
Willie, we've got to be more conspicuous.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.125
Do you mean really flash?

01:14:06.126 --> 01:14:09.463
Gabriel!

01:14:10.297 --> 01:14:11.923
Gabriel!

01:14:12.174 --> 01:14:14.426
Gabriel!

01:14:15.177 --> 01:14:16.678
Gabriel!

01:14:17.763 --> 01:14:20.891
Gabriel!

01:14:22.809 --> 01:14:23.894
Gabriel.

01:14:23.977 --> 01:14:26.271
Gabriel!

01:14:27.064 --> 01:14:28.356
Gabriel.

01:14:31.026 --> 01:14:32.027
Gabriel.

01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:33.487
Gabriel.

01:14:38.158 --> 01:14:39.367
Gabriel.

01:14:40.994 --> 01:14:43.413
I'm beginning to think he doesn't want us.

01:14:47.918 --> 01:14:49.544
Shall we give up?

01:14:50.629 --> 01:14:52.631
Home to bed? Why not?

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.092
Why not?

01:14:56.009 --> 01:14:57.219
Why not?

01:14:57.886 --> 01:14:59.137
Why not?

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.724
- Why not?
- Why not?

01:15:14.069 --> 01:15:18.490
<i>Miss Blaise, I prefer you blond
as you are now.</i>

01:15:20.909 --> 01:15:22.244
Who is it?

01:15:22.744 --> 01:15:24.121
<i>An admirer.</i>

01:15:26.164 --> 01:15:27.874
<i>Weren't you expecting me to call?</i>

01:15:32.254 --> 01:15:34.172
You've taken your time.

01:15:34.714 --> 01:15:35.715
Where are you?

01:15:35.799 --> 01:15:38.760
<i>On the pretty little white boat
below your window.</i>

01:15:43.807 --> 01:15:46.017
<i>It's not mine, of course. Mamma's.</i>

01:15:55.235 --> 01:15:56.611
Much better.

01:15:58.113 --> 01:16:00.365
I offer you a flag of truce

01:16:00.490 --> 01:16:02.325
and a delicious breakfast.

01:16:04.578 --> 01:16:05.954
If you have a good champagne.

01:16:06.246 --> 01:16:07.581
<i>Excellent.</i>

01:16:08.373 --> 01:16:09.958
I suppose you'll want to change.

01:16:10.625 --> 01:16:12.752
I'll send my launch for
you in half an hour.

01:16:13.420 --> 01:16:14.588
An hour.

01:16:14.671 --> 01:16:15.922
<i>An hour?</i>

01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:19.759
An hour.

01:17:45.971 --> 01:17:46.972
Eggs?

01:17:47.055 --> 01:17:48.223
Not Dutch.

01:17:51.768 --> 01:17:53.144
Everything.

01:18:11.538 --> 01:18:13.206
To Modesty Blaise.

01:18:13.999 --> 01:18:15.208
Gabriel.

01:18:19.462 --> 01:18:21.047
You know, it's been a long time.

01:18:26.678 --> 01:18:30.098
1958.

01:18:32.142 --> 01:18:34.144
Very well, Oleg. You can leave us.

01:18:41.026 --> 01:18:42.402
You know.

01:18:43.278 --> 01:18:44.863
I think I prefer you

01:18:45.905 --> 01:18:46.990
dark.

01:18:49.868 --> 01:18:50.910
As you like.

01:18:54.497 --> 01:18:56.249
The royal box at Ascot,

01:18:56.624 --> 01:18:58.043
picking pockets.

01:18:58.877 --> 01:19:00.754
One has to start somewhere, you know.

01:19:02.672 --> 01:19:04.215
Your first mistake.

01:19:04.299 --> 01:19:05.550
My last.

01:19:07.427 --> 01:19:09.137
You really are very beautiful.

01:19:10.263 --> 01:19:12.140
I haven't been dead for two years.

01:19:13.391 --> 01:19:14.893
Very good for one's image.

01:19:16.936 --> 01:19:18.980
The payroll of the Turkish fleet.

01:19:20.023 --> 01:19:21.149
Marvelous.

01:19:21.316 --> 01:19:23.109
Your Brussels job, superb.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:26.071
Two Botticellis and one Grandma Moses.

01:19:26.821 --> 01:19:28.448
One Botticelli,

01:19:29.115 --> 01:19:30.784
two Grandma Moses.

01:19:31.451 --> 01:19:33.161
We really should be partners, you know.

01:19:34.704 --> 01:19:36.331
If I gave the orders.

01:19:37.457 --> 01:19:38.500
Suffragette.

01:19:39.459 --> 01:19:40.460
Psychopath.

01:19:41.586 --> 01:19:43.963
We are under a flag of truce, remember?

01:19:46.466 --> 01:19:48.259
Now, then, about the diamonds.

01:19:50.011 --> 01:19:51.471
About breakfast.

01:19:56.643 --> 01:19:58.061
I have a plan.

01:19:58.144 --> 01:19:59.604
I have Willie Garvin.

01:20:01.106 --> 01:20:03.858
And you're also working
for Her Majesty's government.

01:20:06.486 --> 01:20:07.946
Your second mistake.

01:20:10.490 --> 01:20:12.867
I get my information my own way.

01:20:14.494 --> 01:20:15.829
Naturally.

01:20:17.789 --> 01:20:19.499
Which is why we should be partners.

01:20:21.334 --> 01:20:24.671
And, as partners, you can trust me.

01:20:30.009 --> 01:20:32.929
Not so hard, Mrs. Fothergill, not so hard.

01:21:08.047 --> 01:21:09.674
Lady. Lady.

01:21:38.995 --> 01:21:40.580
Miss Blaise.

01:21:42.332 --> 01:21:43.750
How are you feeling?

01:21:46.127 --> 01:21:47.545
Do sit down.

01:21:48.379 --> 01:21:49.631
Headache?

01:21:51.257 --> 01:21:52.759
I'm so sorry.

01:21:59.974 --> 01:22:01.976
May I present Miss World.

01:22:06.272 --> 01:22:07.398
I'm sorry, princess.

01:22:07.482 --> 01:22:08.983
I was on the job.

01:22:09.067 --> 01:22:10.693
Working overtime.

01:22:14.781 --> 01:22:16.491
Where are you taking me?

01:22:16.616 --> 01:22:18.034
You're on board the <i>Andronicus</i>

01:22:18.117 --> 01:22:20.119
bound from Bizerte to Dubrovnik

01:22:20.328 --> 01:22:22.956
with a cargo of fruit and nuts.

01:22:23.957 --> 01:22:25.458
He's a fruit merchant, see.

01:22:25.625 --> 01:22:26.626
He is a nut.

01:22:27.126 --> 01:22:28.419
That's enough of that.

01:22:29.045 --> 01:22:31.673
Your Mr. Garvin is going to help us.

01:22:32.799 --> 01:22:34.217
Otherwise.

01:22:34.926 --> 01:22:37.262
I really can't say it.
It's just pure melodrama.

01:22:37.345 --> 01:22:38.888
I'm not fussy. I will say it for you.

01:22:38.972 --> 01:22:40.098
Oh, please, no.

01:22:40.181 --> 01:22:43.184
If he doesn't, you will be killed.

01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:46.145
Who's the bird with the beady eyes?

01:22:55.238 --> 01:22:58.658
You've got three hours to master the job.

01:22:58.866 --> 01:23:00.785
Rehearsals start in five minutes.

01:23:00.994 --> 01:23:02.495
Search her thoroughly.

01:23:15.341 --> 01:23:18.052
Your clothes have been searched.
Give me your watch.

01:23:20.471 --> 01:23:22.307
All right. Take that Off.

01:23:26.144 --> 01:23:27.353
There's your belt back.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.314
Pretty, but harmless.

01:23:50.376 --> 01:23:52.253
That's all very well

01:23:52.337 --> 01:23:54.130
but woolen knickers to the knees

01:23:54.422 --> 01:23:56.215
are better for your health.

01:24:09.187 --> 01:24:10.396
Scorpio.

01:24:13.608 --> 01:24:15.943
There is a sting in my tail.

01:24:29.082 --> 01:24:31.125
Enrico, have those vetted.

01:24:33.419 --> 01:24:35.088
Hey, love. Thanks.

01:24:40.218 --> 01:24:41.928
We'll keep her little arsenal.

01:24:42.595 --> 01:24:44.013
She can have those back.

01:25:02.198 --> 01:25:03.533
Oh, no!

01:25:06.411 --> 01:25:08.538
Yes! Everything's delightfully normal.

01:25:08.621 --> 01:25:10.998
The rattle of coffee cups,
the tinkle of music.

01:25:14.961 --> 01:25:16.462
No sign of Modesty.

01:25:16.629 --> 01:25:18.131
Then she's somewhere below.

01:25:18.214 --> 01:25:19.841
Found that registration?

01:25:20.258 --> 01:25:21.509
Registered owner is a Greek.

01:25:21.592 --> 01:25:23.052
Inevitably. What's his name?

01:25:23.469 --> 01:25:24.887
Callimanedis.

01:25:24.971 --> 01:25:28.474
And flying the Panamanian flag
so that we can't board her.

01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:32.603
Take a look at that chap with the
bald head, pouring out the coffee.

01:25:34.063 --> 01:25:35.148
Gabriel?

01:25:35.231 --> 01:25:36.733
Most probably.

01:25:37.150 --> 01:25:38.317
Hello.

01:25:40.611 --> 01:25:42.196
<i>The Tyboria.</i>

01:25:42.655 --> 01:25:43.906
Right on time.

01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:45.616
The plot thickens.

01:25:46.451 --> 01:25:47.618
Cigarette?

01:25:47.702 --> 01:25:49.245
We better get cracking.

01:26:10.933 --> 01:26:12.351
Gabriel's design?

01:26:12.852 --> 01:26:15.053
He's building another one for outer space,
just in case.

01:26:15.146 --> 01:26:16.230
Ready?

01:26:16.314 --> 01:26:17.482
Ready!

01:26:21.819 --> 01:26:22.904
Go!

01:26:59.899 --> 01:27:03.528
Full many a gem of purest ray serene,

01:27:03.945 --> 01:27:07.740
the dark, unfathomed caves
of an ocean bear.

01:27:33.432 --> 01:27:34.934
Your anti-sonic device?

01:27:35.017 --> 01:27:36.853
- Japowski.
- The best.

01:27:37.603 --> 01:27:38.938
Your guidance system?

01:27:39.021 --> 01:27:41.732
Burroughs concealed in a crate of jade.

01:27:42.233 --> 01:27:43.442
Shipped by you.

01:27:44.277 --> 01:27:46.529
Now transmitting
to the submarine capsule.

01:27:46.612 --> 01:27:50.116
They should be in touch with
the Tyboria just about now.

01:28:02.295 --> 01:28:03.796
They should be dropping the pilot.

01:28:06.716 --> 01:28:08.676
Our first contact is magnetic.

01:28:08.759 --> 01:28:10.177
Not strong enough.

01:28:10.261 --> 01:28:12.305
It will hold them till they drop the pilot.

01:28:12.597 --> 01:28:14.849
- The pilot boat.
- The pilot boat.

01:28:33.784 --> 01:28:35.411
The Jacob's Ladder is down.

01:28:40.499 --> 01:28:43.336
In my opinion,
you cut this possibly too fine.

01:28:43.586 --> 01:28:46.172
I've given them the tools.
They must finish the job.

01:29:06.192 --> 01:29:07.526
Their screw's turning.

01:29:10.488 --> 01:29:11.656
How's your drink?

01:29:11.739 --> 01:29:13.199
How's Willie?

01:29:39.475 --> 01:29:41.060
I'm in, darling.

01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:45.064
<i>I just hope it's the right ship.</i>

01:29:47.191 --> 01:29:49.026
He's in the alleyway
between the water tanks.

01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:50.528
How is the timing?

01:29:50.695 --> 01:29:51.862
Exact!

01:30:05.584 --> 01:30:07.128
Remember your promise.

01:30:07.837 --> 01:30:09.005
When we get home.

01:30:09.088 --> 01:30:11.090
No. Now, you said, at sea

01:30:11.507 --> 01:30:13.551
a death on the ocean wave.

01:30:15.928 --> 01:30:18.764
You must learn to sip your pleasures,
Mrs. Fothergill.

01:30:19.015 --> 01:30:21.600
Don't gulp them all down at one go!

01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:34.238
Hello, Captain.

01:30:34.321 --> 01:30:36.657
There's a small cargo ship, the <i>Andronicus,</i>

01:30:36.741 --> 01:30:38.200
flying an Iberian flag.

01:30:39.118 --> 01:30:41.620
She's been standing off a mile
from us on a parallel course.

01:30:41.787 --> 01:30:42.872
<i>Andronicus?</i>

01:30:43.122 --> 01:30:44.707
<i>Andronicus?</i>

01:30:44.957 --> 01:30:47.460
Captain, get the covers off the guns

01:30:48.419 --> 01:30:50.296
and, Captain,
check on that strong room again.

01:31:33.923 --> 01:31:35.007
"Fragile.

01:31:35.091 --> 01:31:36.509
"Porcelain."

01:31:37.593 --> 01:31:38.594
Yes.

01:31:38.719 --> 01:31:40.888
All present and correct, intact.

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:42.807
What's that?

01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:50.189
Looks like a fish.

01:31:58.114 --> 01:31:59.365
I'm an idiot!

01:31:59.448 --> 01:32:03.202
They're not on that yacht.
They're on that bloody cargo boat.

01:33:28.162 --> 01:33:30.122
I'm not a desiccated calculating machine

01:33:30.706 --> 01:33:32.041
like you, McWhirter.

01:33:35.419 --> 01:33:37.713
Nor yet a roaring psychopath,
like you, dear lady.

01:33:42.301 --> 01:33:43.886
I am the villain of the piece

01:33:45.346 --> 01:33:47.097
and I have to condemn you to death.

01:33:47.431 --> 01:33:49.225
But I am the heroine.

01:33:50.184 --> 01:33:51.644
Don't I get away?

01:33:52.561 --> 01:33:53.812
Perhaps.

01:33:58.442 --> 01:34:00.361
Convey Mr. Garvin to the tower.

01:34:02.071 --> 01:34:04.990
And take Modesty to the cell
which I have prepared for her.

01:36:09.365 --> 01:36:10.532
Yes.

01:36:12.785 --> 01:36:14.536
This is the way out.

01:36:19.249 --> 01:36:20.751
On what terms?

01:36:21.001 --> 01:36:22.127
Mine.

01:36:23.170 --> 01:36:24.505
My island,

01:36:24.588 --> 01:36:25.964
my kingdom.

01:36:27.466 --> 01:36:30.010
Join me, Modesty.
We're a match for each other.

01:36:30.677 --> 01:36:33.138
To destroy you would be
like destroying myself,

01:36:33.972 --> 01:36:37.142
but together, we could inherit the earth.

01:36:39.478 --> 01:36:40.813
The terms.

01:36:42.064 --> 01:36:45.275
We share the diamonds
and you eliminate Garvin.

01:36:49.822 --> 01:36:52.157
I'll eliminate Mrs. Fothergill.

01:37:02.042 --> 01:37:04.503
McWhirter, tell Mrs. Fothergill

01:37:04.628 --> 01:37:07.089
to meet me on the Angel Terrace
in one hour's time.

01:37:07.172 --> 01:37:09.800
You come too, and bring your ledgers.

01:37:50.674 --> 01:37:52.050
You're nice.

01:37:53.427 --> 01:37:55.429
I'm sorry we had to stop.

01:44:24.985 --> 01:44:26.027
Splat.

01:46:59.472 --> 01:47:00.765
Princess!

01:47:01.182 --> 01:47:02.600
Kick the bucket!

01:48:01.242 --> 01:48:03.203
Chilean pesos are no use in Calcutta.

01:48:03.328 --> 01:48:05.080
We shall have to use Vladivostok.

01:48:06.164 --> 01:48:08.291
It would mean a loss of three...

01:48:10.085 --> 01:48:11.669
Three million,

01:48:11.961 --> 01:48:13.463
which would be quite unnecessary.

01:48:13.838 --> 01:48:15.340
I entirely agree.

01:48:25.266 --> 01:48:28.353
Callimanedis sent us a bill
for dilapidations to his yacht.

01:48:28.853 --> 01:48:32.440
Ignore it. What does he expect for $10,000?

01:48:33.024 --> 01:48:34.776
What is that woman up to?

01:48:50.166 --> 01:48:52.043
Basilio, Oleg, Strauss!

01:48:52.127 --> 01:48:53.920
Garvin and Blaise have escaped!

01:48:55.839 --> 01:48:57.173
Alec!

01:48:57.257 --> 01:48:58.508
The diamonds.

01:49:05.181 --> 01:49:06.182
Come on, you idiot!

01:49:06.266 --> 01:49:07.475
After you, sir.

01:50:23.885 --> 01:50:24.886
We've had it, princess!

01:50:24.969 --> 01:50:26.304
The moment of truth!

01:50:29.807 --> 01:50:31.392
Yeah! This is it.

01:50:31.476 --> 01:50:33.102
Been nice working with you, pea.

01:50:33.561 --> 01:50:35.605
You know, Willie, we should have.

01:50:35.688 --> 01:50:38.191
Yeah, I suppose we should.

01:50:39.275 --> 01:50:40.902
I don't know, though.

01:50:40.985 --> 01:50:42.070
What?

01:50:44.739 --> 01:50:46.282
Well, I mean...

01:50:47.325 --> 01:50:49.285
It's sort of less common
this way, isn't it?

01:50:51.162 --> 01:50:53.206
Here. Give us a kiss, princess.

01:50:54.999 --> 01:50:58.670
Modesty Blaise!

01:50:59.837 --> 01:51:01.005
Look, Willie!

01:51:03.967 --> 01:51:06.386
Modesty Blaise!

01:51:17.605 --> 01:51:20.525
Here comes the sheik now.
His banner's flying.

01:51:21.276 --> 01:51:23.403
We've got Gabriel on the run.

01:51:24.862 --> 01:51:27.991
<i>We will be lovebirds and give up spying.</i>

01:51:28.533 --> 01:51:31.119
<i>When this battle has been won.</i>

01:51:31.786 --> 01:51:33.663
Modesty Blaise!

01:51:38.876 --> 01:51:40.878
<i>Just you and me.</i>

01:51:41.546 --> 01:51:44.382
<i>A cottage by the sea.</i>

01:51:45.216 --> 01:51:47.760
<i>With roses around the door.</i>

01:51:47.844 --> 01:51:51.889
<i>And babies on the floor, dear.</i>

01:51:58.813 --> 01:52:00.898
<i>We'll take a dream boat.</i>

01:52:01.232 --> 01:52:03.359
<i>And sail away now.</i>

01:52:03.609 --> 01:52:07.113
<i>To the land of sweet romance.</i>

01:52:07.572 --> 01:52:12.327
<i>Just me and you, a quiet place.</i>

01:52:12.493 --> 01:52:15.830
Modesty Blaise!

01:52:23.212 --> 01:52:26.507
<i>We'll have a donkey in the stable.</i>

01:52:26.841 --> 01:52:29.927
<i>For peaceful donkey rides.</i>

01:52:31.179 --> 01:52:34.557
<i>I light the candles on the table.</i>

01:52:34.932 --> 01:52:37.769
<i>By a cozy fireside.</i>

01:52:38.686 --> 01:52:40.688
<i>Just</i> you and I...

01:52:47.278 --> 01:52:48.863
Stop wasting it!

01:52:51.032 --> 01:52:52.658
Get down there. Go on.

01:53:07.256 --> 01:53:09.467
<i>And on the sand.</i>

01:53:10.259 --> 01:53:13.304
<i>We'll wander hand in hand.</i>

01:53:23.731 --> 01:53:25.525
<i>We will get married.</i>

01:53:25.650 --> 01:53:27.276
<i>In the chapel.</i>

01:53:27.527 --> 01:53:30.405
<i>You'll give me a wedding ring.</i>

01:53:39.872 --> 01:53:44.836
<i>At eventide, we'll wander side by side.</i>

01:53:49.298 --> 01:53:52.802
<i>All alone now.</i>

01:53:52.885 --> 01:53:55.263
<i>On our own now.</i>

01:53:57.515 --> 01:54:02.353
<i>Yes, we should do
And we could do.</i>

01:54:02.562 --> 01:54:04.439
<i>Now we can.</i>

01:54:23.875 --> 01:54:25.918
Put it down. Don't point.

01:54:26.461 --> 01:54:27.670
It's rude.

01:55:08.044 --> 01:55:09.462
Tarrant speaking.

01:55:09.545 --> 01:55:10.880
- Tarrant?
- Minister?

01:55:11.047 --> 01:55:12.924
- Tarrant.
- Minister, we've done it.

01:55:13.758 --> 01:55:14.926
Mission accomplished.

01:55:15.009 --> 01:55:17.595
<i>- Well done.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

01:55:34.445 --> 01:55:35.530
Sir.

01:56:57.862 --> 01:56:59.363
Your third mistake.

01:57:37.485 --> 01:57:38.819
Champagne.

01:57:40.655 --> 01:57:41.989
Champagne.

01:57:45.493 --> 01:57:46.869
Champagne.

01:57:47.912 --> 01:57:49.372
Champagne.

01:57:53.125 --> 01:57:54.502
Champagne.

01:57:55.419 --> 01:57:57.880
No! No! No!

01:57:59.674 --> 01:58:02.843
McWhirter, my God,
I thought you were mother.

01:58:18.025 --> 01:58:19.985
What can I do for you, my son?

01:58:21.028 --> 01:58:22.363
Nothing.

01:58:22.446 --> 01:58:24.448
You can ask for anything.

01:58:25.116 --> 01:58:26.409
Anything?

01:58:26.701 --> 01:58:27.952
Anything.

01:58:30.663 --> 01:58:32.123
The diamonds.
