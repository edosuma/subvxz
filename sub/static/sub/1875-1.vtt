...the quest will claim his life.

of the Ring grows strong.

It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men.

by its power.

02:13:54.693 --> 02:13:58.279
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

02:13:58.447 --> 02:14:02.533
...take the Ring for his own,
and the world will fall.

02:14:04.953 --> 02:14:06.787
It is close now.

has attacked Rohan.

But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

02:14:54.044 --> 02:14:56.462
Sauron is marshaling an army.

02:14:56.797 --> 02:14:58.923
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

02:14:59.090 --> 02:15:02.510

-Some thousands. More come every day.

02:15:03.595 --> 02:15:07.181
-Who's covering the river to the north?
-We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

we won't hold it.

Sauron will strike us soon.

02:15:28.036 --> 02:15:29.870
And he will strike hard.

02:15:30.330 --> 02:15:34.416
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

then who are you?

There was no other.

02:16:31.933 --> 02:16:34.268

with seven companions.

...a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

02:16:47.365 --> 02:16:51.285
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

02:16:56.290 --> 02:16:58.041

that he is dead.

I'd hoped you would tell me.
