* Edelweiss, edelweiss *

*Small and white *

00:29.230 --> 00:33.434

00:33.434 --> 00:42.076

01:22.550 --> 01:27.255
Man: Walk.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.357
[indistinct shouting]

01:29.857 --> 01:31.692
Go!

01:46.774 --> 01:49.977
[sighs]

01:49.977 --> 01:53.481
Frank and I were supposed
to leave on the 11:00 bus.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.183
What do you mean,
leave?

02:01.289 --> 02:03.224
In some kind of trouble?

02:06.727 --> 02:08.862
Yeah. He is.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.867
I'm stuck in here, and if he
doesn't get on that bus--

02:23.211 --> 02:25.213
You got to get on now.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.548
Not without Jules.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.317
Frank, this is
your last chance. Go.

02:29.317 --> 02:30.718
I'll put her on
another bus tomorrow.

02:30.718 --> 02:33.086
What if something's
happened to her?

02:33.086 --> 02:34.388
I-- I can't.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.757
You fellas getting on or not?

02:36.757 --> 02:37.825
- Yes.
- No.

02:40.228 --> 02:41.829
It's no.

02:41.829 --> 02:42.830
Right.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.301
[engine starts]

03:03.484 --> 03:05.353
I'm sorry, Juliana.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.989
It's not your fault.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.559
You wouldn't be in here
if it weren't for me.

03:14.495 --> 03:17.765
How'd you know anyway?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.267
Someone--

03:20.268 --> 03:21.469
Someone told me
the Kempeitai

03:21.469 --> 03:22.803
were going
to raid that club.

03:24.905 --> 03:25.973
Who?

03:25.973 --> 03:28.309
It doesn't matter, does it?

03:28.309 --> 03:29.877
The film's gone.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.063
You ready to go?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.899
Just about.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.701
[clatter]

03:58.005 --> 04:00.107
Don't worry. I'm okay.

04:00.107 --> 04:03.777
Thomas, I warned you about
racing down those stairs.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.946
I wasn't, Mother.
I promise. I--

04:05.946 --> 04:06.847
I don't know
what happened.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.417
I must have--
I must have slipped.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.851
It's called
being a clumsy oaf.

04:10.851 --> 04:11.852
Shut up, Amy.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.490
- Come on, girls.
- Are you all right?

04:17.458 --> 04:19.360
Yeah, I'm-- I'm fine.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.928
It's-- It's nothing.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.397
You, uh, you go on.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.765
I'll drop him off on the way.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.934
Let's see if we can get you
cleaned up, shall we?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.816
So where were you
and Frank headed?

04:45.919 --> 04:47.621
The Neutral Zone.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.591
Were you going to live there?

04:53.627 --> 04:57.197
Maybe try to get down
to South America.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.467
I don't know, really.

05:02.235 --> 05:04.638
So if I would have
come here a day later,

05:04.638 --> 05:07.675
then I would have
never seen you again.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.684
Frank must really be
in some kind of trouble.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.387
What did he do?

05:20.954 --> 05:22.956
I can't-- I can't
talk about it, Joe.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.395
You.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.763
Where are you taking her?

05:31.432 --> 05:33.401
[shouts in Japanese]

05:35.235 --> 05:37.405
Hey! Where are you taking her?

05:37.405 --> 05:38.472
[thumping]

05:38.472 --> 05:40.641
Juliana! Hey!

05:47.481 --> 05:49.650
Oh, here she is.

05:49.650 --> 05:53.153
Are you quite unharmed,
Miss Crain?

05:53.153 --> 05:54.655
Yes, I'm fine.

05:54.655 --> 05:57.458
Here you go.
10,000 yen.

06:07.334 --> 06:08.869
You may go.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.671
Aren't you
forgetting something?

06:12.105 --> 06:13.874
- The film.
- What about it?

06:13.874 --> 06:16.076
We paid for it last night.
It's ours.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.746
That was before you
brought the Kempeitai

06:18.746 --> 06:20.180
upon my place of business.

06:20.180 --> 06:23.451
That money will serve
as a compensation.

06:23.451 --> 06:24.485
[chuckling]

06:24.485 --> 06:26.153
Compensation.

06:26.153 --> 06:29.523
If you can come up
with the same sum again--

06:30.458 --> 06:31.659
Uh-huh.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.996
Hey. What about Joe?

06:35.996 --> 06:38.532
We spent all the money
we had on you.

06:38.532 --> 06:39.667
We're not
leaving him here.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.669
We don't have a choice.

06:44.605 --> 06:45.973
What will you do with him?

06:47.508 --> 06:49.677
If no ransom is paid,

06:49.677 --> 06:51.512
deliver him
to the authorities.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.946
They'll kill him.

06:52.946 --> 06:54.682
I expect they will.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.185
I'll get
you 10,000 yen.

07:01.955 --> 07:06.494
Your friend is a member of
the East Coast Resistance.

07:06.494 --> 07:09.997
That makes him of
considerably greater value.

07:09.997 --> 07:11.499
How much greater?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.503
50,000 yen.

07:17.605 --> 07:18.739
I'll get it.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.373
You have 50,000 yen?

07:20.373 --> 07:21.775
I said I'd get it.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.152
Karen: Where are you going
to get that kind of money?

07:32.152 --> 07:33.754
That's my business.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.823
Lemuel:
I just spent 10,000 yen
getting you out.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.958
Yeah, what makes me so
valuable to you anyway?

07:37.958 --> 07:39.593
You've got a job
at the Nippon.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.061
I told you that could
be useful to us.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.863
Oh, I see. So I
work for you now.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.532
We just saved
your life, Juliana,

07:44.532 --> 07:45.699
and you don't seem
very appreciative.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.800
Of course
I'm appreciative.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.002
I'm worried
about Joe. Okay?

07:49.002 --> 07:50.604
Okay, look,
this may be hard,

07:50.604 --> 07:52.573
but if you can get your
hands on 50,000 yen,

07:52.573 --> 07:53.974
we can't spend it on him.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.009
You have to spend it
trying to get back the film.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.545
You'll let him die
for a film.

07:57.545 --> 07:58.846
My husband Dom gave his life

07:58.846 --> 08:00.614
for one of those films
last year.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.816
So did my two brothers.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.385
A month later, we got the name
of a guard at Folsom.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.888
He helped ten of our people
in solitary to escape.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.623
Because you
delivered a film?

08:09.623 --> 08:11.224
How does that even work?

08:11.224 --> 08:14.361
The point is if you're
going to be one of us,

08:14.361 --> 08:16.063
you got to be ready
to sacrifice.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.903
I'm sorry. I'm not
ready to do that.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.598
Good morning, Erich.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.936
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.675
It's...

09:02.810 --> 09:04.878
good to see you awake.

09:06.313 --> 09:07.848
You look much better.

09:07.848 --> 09:11.018
I'm sure I couldn't
have looked much worse.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.285
[chuckle]

09:15.055 --> 09:16.624
I, uh...

09:19.827 --> 09:23.130
I owe you my life,
Erich.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.834
And I owe you mine, sir.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.107
We still don't know

09:34.107 --> 09:37.044
who told those Semites
where to hit us?

09:47.554 --> 09:48.989
Well, whoever it was,

09:48.989 --> 09:50.858
I think they're working
under the orders

09:50.858 --> 09:53.160
of OberstgruppenfÃ¼hrer
Heydrich.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.028
Heydrich?

09:57.665 --> 10:00.133
Why would he
want you dead?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.270
I'm not certain.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.409
[sigh]

10:09.409 --> 10:10.711
Erich.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.982
If anything
should happen to me...

10:16.016 --> 10:17.785
I want you to do
everything you can

10:17.785 --> 10:19.252
to get this directly
to the FÃ¼hrer

10:19.252 --> 10:22.022
and only the FÃ¼hrer.
Do you understand me?

10:22.022 --> 10:24.591
Yes, ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.027
I don't think
they'll come after you,

10:27.027 --> 10:30.130
but I had a guard put
outside, just in case.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.800
Thank you, sir.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.636
You get well
quickly now, Erich.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.273
I need good men
around me.

10:41.441 --> 10:42.976
Men I can trust.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.518
[footsteps]

11:25.518 --> 11:27.387
[muffled speaking]

11:29.222 --> 11:31.358
[muffled speaking]

11:31.358 --> 11:32.860
Trade Minister?

11:36.529 --> 11:38.065
Yes?

11:38.065 --> 11:40.433
I'm sorry to intrude,
Trade Minister,

11:40.433 --> 11:43.236
but Chief Inspector Kido
is here to see you.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.339
Very well.
Show him in.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.545
Trade Minister.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.047
Chief Inspector.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.784
Your ministry keeps records
on the import activity

11:56.784 --> 11:59.119
of ships reaching
our port from Osaka.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.888
Yes.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.823
We require them.

12:04.591 --> 12:06.126
Why, may I ask?

12:06.126 --> 12:08.661
We believe the Yakuza
has been using them

12:08.661 --> 12:09.997
to smuggle heroin.

12:09.997 --> 12:13.333
Well, surely this is
no surprise to you.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.602
My understanding
is that the Kempeitai

12:15.602 --> 12:17.470
has long tolerated
such smuggling.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.508
Perhaps, but no more.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.311
Has something happened?

12:24.311 --> 12:28.916
You will provide the records
as requested, please.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.309
Psst. Jules.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.048
You have to come
with me right now.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.560
Good morning, Frank.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.562
Good morning, Mr. McCarthy.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.230
You care for some coffee?

13:17.230 --> 13:18.265
No, thanks.

13:18.265 --> 13:21.869
I heard you come in
last night.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.436
Yeah.
Sorry if we woke you.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.737
It was kind of late.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.639
You slept here?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.876
Yeah, I hope
you don't mind.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.711
What's wrong
with your place?

13:31.711 --> 13:32.980
[door opens]

13:34.247 --> 13:35.448
Hey, Ed.

13:37.684 --> 13:38.886
Hey.

13:43.223 --> 13:44.524
Hi.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.661
I'm, uh, sorry
about last night.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.397
What happened
last night?

13:50.397 --> 13:52.966
We were supposed
to meet at the bar.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.402
Ed: Hey, Grandpa,
want some coffee?

13:55.402 --> 13:56.904
Frank already offered.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.406
All right, let me
get you another cup.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.407
Here we go.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.418
- Frank, let me explain.
- What the fuck happened?

14:11.418 --> 14:13.153
Listen, there was a raid
by the Kempeitai.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.621
- You said you'd be there.
- Yes, I know I did,

14:14.621 --> 14:16.089
- and I tried to get there.
- And I was waiting

14:16.089 --> 14:17.090
and waiting and waiting.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.625
I understand. I tried.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.593
I couldn't get there, Frank.
I would have been there--

14:20.593 --> 14:21.528
What about your friends?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.532
The guy from the Resistance,
Joe Blake,

14:25.532 --> 14:26.533
is being held by the Yakuza.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.135
What has the Yakuza
got to do with this?

14:28.135 --> 14:29.602
They've got a film
that he's trying to buy.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.571
- Oh, another goddamn film.
- Yes, another film.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.380
Yes. Okay.
Now they've got him.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.115
And if they don't get
50,000 yen, they're going to

14:42.115 --> 14:43.716
turn him in and they're
gonna kill him, Frank.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.852
You're not asking
for my money.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.188
That's our way out,
our future.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.958
I know.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.792
I can't just let him die,
Frank.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.594
- Why not?
- Why not?

14:54.594 --> 14:56.863
Yeah. Let him die.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.398
Juliana, let him die.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.967
Let him die?
Frank, who are you?

14:59.967 --> 15:01.234
Lots of people die,
okay?

15:01.234 --> 15:03.236
The Kempeitai

15:03.236 --> 15:06.974
could come for me
at any second.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.209
I can't even go home.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.810
I understand.
We'll find another way.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.746
There is no other way.
I should have left last night.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.482
Maybe, but you didn't.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.186
You stayed for me, Frank.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.554
Yeah. Yeah, and now
I'm wondering why,

15:21.554 --> 15:25.392
you know, if you've always
got another excuse.

15:25.392 --> 15:28.128
Why do you care so much
about him anyway?

15:28.128 --> 15:31.564
Frank, Look at me.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.002
I want to be with you.

15:35.002 --> 15:36.336
You hear me?

15:36.336 --> 15:38.571
But that man saved my life.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.240
I've got to try.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.808
I can't just let him die.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.876
I've got to try. I won't be
able to live with myself.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.578
Please understand me.

15:58.325 --> 16:01.328
I mean, you know
I've only got 46,000.

16:01.328 --> 16:02.229
Hmm?

16:02.229 --> 16:03.930
Yeah.
Maybe it'll be enough.

16:03.930 --> 16:06.466
I could convince him
that it'll be enough.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.476
All right. No. I will.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.179
No, you will what?
What do you mean?

16:19.179 --> 16:21.681
Well, it's my money,
all right?

16:21.681 --> 16:23.050
I'm going.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.052
You go?

16:25.052 --> 16:26.186
- Yeah.
- You can't.

16:26.186 --> 16:27.654
You can't.
They're expecting me.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.356
They're expecting cash.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.292
They're not going to
care who brings it.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.062
I'll get him out of there.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.696
And then I'm getting
out of here, okay?

16:36.696 --> 16:38.431
With or without you.

16:53.746 --> 16:54.747
[door closes]

17:08.795 --> 17:15.168
* If we stop to gaze
upon our stars *

17:15.168 --> 17:21.108
* People talk about
how bad we are *

17:21.108 --> 17:23.876
* Ours is not an easy age *

17:23.876 --> 17:27.414
* We're like tigers in a cage *

17:27.414 --> 17:32.385
* What a town
without pity can do *

17:43.296 --> 17:46.233
You appreciate wine,
Colonel Wegener?

17:46.233 --> 17:49.169
I'm no connoisseur,
OberstgruppenfÃ¼hrer,

17:49.169 --> 17:52.672
but I will certainly
drink it.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.607
Enjoy it.

17:58.044 --> 18:01.748
Mmm.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.753
Interesting interrogation
technique.

18:06.753 --> 18:10.157
Do you intend
to kill me with kindness?

18:10.157 --> 18:12.559
Not with kindness.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.197
I'm aware of the treason
you committed

18:17.197 --> 18:18.831
in the Pacific States:

18:18.831 --> 18:21.268
stealing the design for
the Heisenberg device

18:21.268 --> 18:22.802
from Reichforschungarat,

18:22.802 --> 18:25.638
passing it to the Japanese
Science Minister.

18:25.638 --> 18:29.041
That Officer Muller.
He recognized me.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.877
We decoded
Japanese transmissions

18:30.877 --> 18:33.613
a few days ago,
confirming our suspicions.

18:33.613 --> 18:37.650
Why am I not in front
of a firing squad?

18:37.650 --> 18:38.851
Ah.

18:38.851 --> 18:42.289
Because our brave FÃ¼hrer
is a great man

18:42.289 --> 18:44.324
but not infallible.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.193
He's had
the poor judgment

18:46.193 --> 18:48.361
to maintain peace
with the Japanese,

18:48.361 --> 18:52.365
and for some reason,
he sees merit in you.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.835
I have the FÃ¼hrer's trust.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.270
Yes?

18:57.270 --> 18:59.939
And that is why
I traveled to New York

18:59.939 --> 19:01.608
and brought you
out of your cell

19:01.608 --> 19:03.343
and back into uniform

19:03.343 --> 19:05.878
to exploit that trust.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.614
Whatever you want,

19:07.614 --> 19:10.650
surely you don't
expect me to help you.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.487
Your life is over.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.224
I think
we both know that.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.459
But you have a wife,
children,

19:19.459 --> 19:21.694
Whether their lives
are spared

19:21.694 --> 19:23.230
depends on you.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.486
Who are you?

20:22.054 --> 20:24.090
I brought the money

20:24.090 --> 20:25.892
for, uh, Joe Blake.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.127
50,000 yen.

20:28.127 --> 20:30.129
46,000.

20:30.129 --> 20:33.300
That's--
That's all I have.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.790
[man shouts in Japanese]

21:00.760 --> 21:02.729
What are you reading,
Mr. McCarthy?

21:02.729 --> 21:03.830
Manga.

21:03.830 --> 21:07.233
"The Adventures
of Miyamoto Musashi."

21:07.233 --> 21:08.935
Do you know who that was?

21:08.935 --> 21:10.770
Samurai, wasn't he?

21:10.770 --> 21:13.540
Killed his first man at 13.

21:13.540 --> 21:16.776
But he was utterly ruthless.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.614
That's what the Pons
understand that we don't.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.584
You want to win,
there's no room for mercy.

21:24.584 --> 21:27.920
You got to be prepared
to do anything.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.023
[door opens]

21:36.396 --> 21:39.265
Hey, Jules, could I
show you something?

21:39.265 --> 21:40.933
Sure.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.605
- We've got a problem.
- What is it?

21:45.605 --> 21:46.806
I went to the bus station

21:46.806 --> 21:48.675
to get you and Frank
new tickets,

21:48.675 --> 21:50.943
but now they won't sell
them, not without I.D.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.545
You think they're
looking for Frank?

21:52.545 --> 21:53.980
Yeah, they must be.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.617
How do we get out of here?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.026
[footsteps]

22:13.299 --> 22:14.901
Where's Juliana?

22:14.901 --> 22:15.968
She's fine.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.237
Who the hell are you?

22:18.237 --> 22:19.772
The guy who's saving your ass.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.108
Can we go now?

22:23.643 --> 22:24.511
Go.

22:24.511 --> 22:25.645
Now wait a second.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.514
What about the film?

22:29.416 --> 22:31.017
You have lost it.

22:33.553 --> 22:36.222
No. I paid good money
for that thing.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.791
It no longer
belongs to you.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.027
I'm not leaving here
without it.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.796
Then you won't be
leaving here at all.

22:45.264 --> 22:47.033
Come on.
We're going now.

23:10.457 --> 23:11.791
Give it to me!

23:12.959 --> 23:14.093
Give it to me.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.662
[pounding]

23:25.171 --> 23:27.106
Come on, come on!

23:44.491 --> 23:45.725
You're Frank, right?

23:45.725 --> 23:47.326
You stupid son of a bitch!

23:47.326 --> 23:49.295
You fuck.
You killed those men.

23:49.295 --> 23:50.663
I needed that film.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.298
Okay, that was the Yakuza,
you understand?

23:52.298 --> 23:53.933
The Yakuza,
and I live here.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.668
- Yeah, not for much longer.
- What do you know about that?

23:55.668 --> 23:57.036
Just that you and Juliana
are leaving.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.938
That's right. You want
to fuck up your own life,

23:58.938 --> 24:00.306
you go ahead, but leave
us the hell out of it.

24:00.306 --> 24:01.541
Where are you
taking her, Frank?

24:01.541 --> 24:02.642
I'm going to take her
someplace

24:02.642 --> 24:04.977
you'll never
see her again.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.414
You're going to want this.

24:08.414 --> 24:09.949
Yeah, right.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.051
Now you used up
all the bullets.

24:27.534 --> 24:28.768
Chief Inspector,

24:28.768 --> 24:31.571
we received a call
from Taishi Okamura.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.405
What does he want?

24:33.405 --> 24:36.175
He says the film he was
peddling last night
has been stolen.

24:36.175 --> 24:39.178
Not inclined to believe
Yakuza lies, Sergeant.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.614
He claims the thief
was an East Coast
Resistance operative

24:41.614 --> 24:43.149
who killed
two of his men.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.216
Did he leave a name?

24:44.216 --> 24:45.752
Joe Blake.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.658
He was with another man

24:51.658 --> 24:54.126
fitting the description
of Frank Frink.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.098
[clock ticks]

25:10.409 --> 25:12.178
You and Frank.

25:13.312 --> 25:15.815
Are you in some
kind of trouble?

25:17.483 --> 25:19.285
Everything's fine,
Grandpa.

25:19.285 --> 25:24.123
I can't use my legs,
but my eyes work just fine.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.625
Don't lie to me.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.028
Yes, sir.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.196
We are.

25:30.196 --> 25:33.633
How dare you bring this
upon my house,

25:33.633 --> 25:35.134
upon my grandson.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.435
They're my friends.

25:36.435 --> 25:39.606
Friends wouldn't involve you
in their mess like this.

25:39.606 --> 25:40.807
Grandpa, they need help.

25:40.807 --> 25:42.942
The Japs
will kill you, Ed.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.644
They'll kill me, too.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.613
He's right.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.216
We're very sorry,
Mr. McCarthy.

25:50.216 --> 25:53.319
You have ten minutes.

25:53.319 --> 25:56.122
Then I want you out of here.

25:56.122 --> 25:59.626
Or I call
the Kempeitai myself.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.729
[door opens, closes]

26:04.196 --> 26:05.632
You okay?

26:06.699 --> 26:08.300
Not exactly.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.437
I got him out.

26:11.437 --> 26:12.639
You did?

26:12.639 --> 26:14.173
Thank you.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.743
The problem now is how
to get you guys out.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.011
Yeah.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.713
He, uh, tried
to get the bus tickets.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.649
They're demanding
I.D. papers.

26:22.649 --> 26:23.549
You got to be kidding me.

26:23.549 --> 26:24.917
Ed:
I'm sorry, Frank.

26:26.518 --> 26:27.787
Your friends
from last night,

26:27.787 --> 26:29.021
could they help us?

26:29.021 --> 26:30.890
No. No, they're not
going to help us.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.458
They want me working
in the Nippon Building

26:32.458 --> 26:33.525
where I can serve them.

26:33.525 --> 26:35.061
Fuck, fuck.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.731
There's got to be another way.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.675
Major. Good afternoon.

26:48.675 --> 26:50.977
Good afternoon.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.680
Have you seen
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer Smith?

26:53.680 --> 26:55.314
No. He hasn't
been in today.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.516
That's odd, isn't it?

26:57.516 --> 26:59.451
Is it?

26:59.451 --> 27:01.688
Do you know where he went?

27:01.688 --> 27:03.455
I'm right here,
Captain.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.257
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

27:05.257 --> 27:08.861
I was concerned. You didn't
phone in this morning.

27:08.861 --> 27:13.065
Well, you needn't worry,
as you can see.

27:13.065 --> 27:16.769
Might I have
a brief word in private?

27:21.440 --> 27:22.809
Frank!

27:24.110 --> 27:25.244
Yeah.

27:28.514 --> 27:30.116
I...

27:30.116 --> 27:31.517
Here.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.720
What are
you doing?

27:33.720 --> 27:35.087
What's it look
like I'm doing?

27:35.087 --> 27:36.622
We can't--
We can't take this.

27:36.622 --> 27:38.324
No, no, Jules. Listen.

27:38.324 --> 27:39.892
I know it's not much.

27:39.892 --> 27:41.093
It's only
a few hundred yen,

27:41.093 --> 27:42.461
but it's better
than nothing.

27:42.461 --> 27:43.562
Ed, come on.

27:43.562 --> 27:46.298
Don't argue with me,
all right?

27:46.298 --> 27:47.734
Where you guys are going,

27:47.734 --> 27:50.336
you're going to need
all the help you can get.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.871
Take it.

27:57.343 --> 27:58.745
What about the gun?

27:58.745 --> 27:59.879
I got it.

28:03.115 --> 28:06.318
All right.
Then give it to me.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.854
I'll get rid of it.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.762
I don't know if I'll
see you again, so--

28:15.762 --> 28:18.965
Oh, no, no.
I'll see you again.

28:21.133 --> 28:23.102
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.837
Come here.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.508
You're a good friend.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.243
Thank you.

28:33.279 --> 28:34.380
All right.

28:34.380 --> 28:35.414
Go.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.649
Go.

28:37.649 --> 28:38.818
Come on.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.089
Sir, if this is
about yesterday,

28:43.089 --> 28:44.523
I'd like to apologize

28:44.523 --> 28:45.691
for surprising you

28:45.691 --> 28:47.093
with OberstgruppenfÃ¼hrer
Heydrich.

28:47.093 --> 28:48.795
Oh, you don't have
to apologize, Captain.

28:48.795 --> 28:50.496
You didn't know
he was coming.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.231
Did you?

28:52.231 --> 28:53.499
No.

28:53.499 --> 28:56.302
But you did know

28:56.302 --> 28:58.504
that he takes four sugars
in his coffee.

29:00.206 --> 29:03.075
And you--
you did have access

29:03.075 --> 29:05.912
to the travel routes for me
and HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer Lautz

29:05.912 --> 29:08.214
on the day our cars
were ambushed

29:08.214 --> 29:10.216
and to the cell

29:10.216 --> 29:12.518
where the terrorist Semite

29:12.518 --> 29:16.055
supposedly
slit his own throat.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.825
Sir, you can't suspect me.
We've been through this.

29:18.825 --> 29:20.459
Yes.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.862
But I didn't know then

29:22.862 --> 29:25.097
that it was Heydrich
who gave the order.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.666
Now, if it was Heydrich,

29:27.666 --> 29:30.336
I can see why a man
might be prepared

29:30.336 --> 29:33.072
to take a bullet
to the back of the head

29:33.072 --> 29:34.841
before you betray him.

29:36.575 --> 29:39.211
Oh, I understand.

29:39.211 --> 29:43.149
You were just
following orders.

29:43.149 --> 29:44.383
You probably don't
even know

29:44.383 --> 29:46.518
why he wanted me
and Lautz out of the way.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.590
No, sir. I don't.

29:51.590 --> 29:54.526
I didn't think so.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.362
Aah!

30:09.141 --> 30:13.079
Major Klemm,
alert the police.

30:13.079 --> 30:15.081
There's been a suicide.

30:21.988 --> 30:24.823

30:32.598 --> 30:33.966
Shit.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.338
Not that way.
What are you doing here?

30:39.338 --> 30:41.607
- We need your help.
- They're checking
identity papers

30:41.607 --> 30:42.741
at the bus station.

30:42.741 --> 30:44.043
We need another way
out of the city.

30:44.043 --> 30:45.211
Why don't you ask
Karen and Lem?

30:45.211 --> 30:46.378
Because we're asking you.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.614
- Can you help us, Joe?
- I can try.

30:48.614 --> 30:51.083
You're going to have to do
a hell of a lot more than try.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.484
[Man shouting in Japanese]

30:52.484 --> 30:54.020
What is he saying?

30:54.020 --> 30:55.487
He's telling you to stop.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.256
[shouting in Japanese]

30:57.256 --> 30:58.991
Take this.
I'm going to lose him.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.526

meet you later?

31:00.526 --> 31:02.028
There's a school
around the corner.
It'll be closed today.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.162
- Okay.
- Be careful.

31:03.162 --> 31:04.563
[shouting in Japanese]

31:10.269 --> 31:11.537
Colonel.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.473
You look rested.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.042
Hardly.

31:17.443 --> 31:21.180
You've had time to reflect
on your situation.

31:22.848 --> 31:24.016
I have.

31:27.753 --> 31:29.255
This is a list of names,

31:29.255 --> 31:31.123
not just my wife
and children

31:31.123 --> 31:34.193
but her father and
the rest of her family.

31:37.129 --> 31:40.066
Ten lives
in exchange for yours.

31:40.066 --> 31:41.667
That's the deal.

31:47.173 --> 31:49.475
You need not worry, Colonel.

31:49.475 --> 31:52.611
Come.
You have a rocket to board.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.346
Where am I going?

31:54.346 --> 31:56.315
Berlin.

31:58.184 --> 32:01.187
What is it you expect
me to do there?

32:01.187 --> 32:05.024
I thought it was
obvious, Colonel.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.326
The FÃ¼hrer is old and ill,

32:07.326 --> 32:09.495
standing in the way
of the empire he built.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.000
Am I meant to talk to him?

32:14.000 --> 32:15.601
No, Colonel Wegener.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.469
You're meant to kill him.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.073
[speaking Japanese]

32:24.010 --> 32:25.611
General Hata.

32:25.611 --> 32:26.878
Trade Minister.

32:26.878 --> 32:28.047
Please.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.526
You have compiled the data

32:40.526 --> 32:43.395
on the uranium deposits
in the Neutral Zone?

32:43.395 --> 32:46.765
We are collecting it
now, General.

32:46.765 --> 32:49.235
May I ask what it concerns?

32:50.669 --> 32:52.171
You are aware

32:52.171 --> 32:54.806
that our failure to develop
the Heisenberg device

32:54.806 --> 32:59.111
has put us at
a strategic disadvantage
to the Nazi Empire.

32:59.111 --> 33:00.312
Yes, of course.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.948
While our Science
Minister was here

33:02.948 --> 33:04.816
for the Crown Prince's
address,

33:04.816 --> 33:08.754
he discovered
a roll of microfilm
in his suit pocket.

33:08.754 --> 33:11.090
It contained
the technical information

33:11.090 --> 33:13.725
needed to build
our own device.

33:13.725 --> 33:16.128
That is wonderful,
General.

33:16.128 --> 33:18.197
If we develop
our own weapon,

33:18.197 --> 33:20.132
we will have parity
with the Nazis.

33:20.132 --> 33:23.635
We have no interest
in parity.

33:25.937 --> 33:29.108
But surely
a balance in power

33:29.108 --> 33:30.909
would achieve
the Crown Prince's dream

33:30.909 --> 33:32.244
of a sustainable peace.

33:32.244 --> 33:34.213
The Crown Prince
is a changed man

33:34.213 --> 33:36.615
since the attempted
assassination.

33:36.615 --> 33:39.585
He has woken up
to the Nazi threat.

33:39.585 --> 33:43.455
Whoever gave those plans
to the Science Minister

33:43.455 --> 33:46.458
cannot have intended them
to promote war.

33:46.458 --> 33:48.494
What relevance
could that possibly have?

33:48.494 --> 33:50.696
If we strike with
such a terrible weapon,

33:50.696 --> 33:54.233
you must know the Nazis
will retaliate.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.734
Millions will die.

33:58.104 --> 34:03.409
These matters are
not of your concern,
Trade Minister.

34:03.409 --> 34:07.346
You will please supply
the necessary information

34:07.346 --> 34:09.648
on the uranium deposits.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.475
Good night, Major.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.043
Good night,
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer.

34:39.678 --> 34:42.148
This is Major Klemm.

34:42.148 --> 34:43.449
Sir.

34:44.950 --> 34:46.518
It's Joe Blake.

34:58.164 --> 34:59.565
[door closes]

34:59.565 --> 35:00.432
Yes, Joe?

35:00.432 --> 35:02.301
I got the film, sir.

35:02.301 --> 35:04.903
Well done.

35:04.903 --> 35:06.172
I'm pleased.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.539
There's a...

35:07.539 --> 35:10.376
a little bit
of a problem.

35:10.376 --> 35:12.678
I had to kill
two men to get it.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.846
They were members
of the Yakuza.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.715
The police are
looking for me, sir.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.318
I'm going to need help
getting out of the city.

35:19.318 --> 35:20.786
Oh, we can manage that.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.722
Can you stay someplace
out of sight for a few hours?

35:23.722 --> 35:24.823
Yes, sir.

35:26.592 --> 35:28.927
I'm going to need to take
some people with me, sir.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.729
What are you talking about?

35:32.264 --> 35:33.632
Juliana Crain.

35:33.632 --> 35:34.900
She helped me.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.368
- Joe.
- Look, I need--

35:36.368 --> 35:38.103
I need to get her out
and her boyfriend, too.

35:38.103 --> 35:39.471
That's not how it works.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.307
She risked her life
for me, sir.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.874
That was her decision.

35:42.874 --> 35:43.909
I owe her my life.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.844
Is she with you now?

35:47.213 --> 35:49.080
No, sir.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.550
You owe her nothing, Joe.

35:51.550 --> 35:55.687
That woman is an operative
for the Resistance.

35:55.687 --> 36:00.659
Next time you see her,
she's not to be rescued.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.394
She is to be shot.

36:02.394 --> 36:04.296
Do you understand me?

36:06.932 --> 36:08.267
Yes, sir.

36:22.948 --> 36:25.684
We are looking for the man
who killed your guards,

36:25.684 --> 36:29.521
but I assume that's not
why you asked me here.

36:29.521 --> 36:33.825
You impounded heroin
at the docks this afternoon.

36:35.261 --> 36:38.330
Am I to conclude that this
was in retaliation?

36:38.330 --> 36:40.466
You may conclude
as you wish.

36:42.668 --> 36:46.472
Such behavior is futile,
Chief Inspector.

36:46.472 --> 36:48.807
The Yakuza
cannot be destroyed

36:48.807 --> 36:51.877
any more than the sun
can destroy the shade.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.512
This has been
understood

36:53.512 --> 36:55.514
in our homeland
for centuries.

36:55.514 --> 36:57.483
I cannot destroy
the shadows you cast,

36:57.483 --> 36:59.818
but I can and will contain it.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.287
That is my duty.

37:01.287 --> 37:02.888
Just as it is
your duty

37:02.888 --> 37:05.824
to arrest
the man who shot
the Crown Prince.

37:05.824 --> 37:09.160
I'm told if you do not
make an arrest by tomorrow,

37:09.160 --> 37:11.663
Tokyo demands that you
commit seppuku.

37:11.663 --> 37:14.566
No one need remind me
of my duty.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.303
I have a suspect
close at hand.

37:17.303 --> 37:18.804
You mean that hakujin?

37:18.804 --> 37:21.473
The one who works
in the replica factory?

37:21.473 --> 37:24.376
The real assassin fired
from a clock tower

37:24.376 --> 37:25.844
with a sniper's rifle.

37:25.844 --> 37:29.180
Your so-called inconclusive
ballistics report

37:29.180 --> 37:31.317
told you as much.

37:32.784 --> 37:35.220
What's your point?

37:35.220 --> 37:38.089
I believe you have
pursued a false suspect

37:38.089 --> 37:41.126
to disguise a truth
you have known
from the start:

37:41.126 --> 37:43.795
that the assassin
is a Nazi agent.

37:43.795 --> 37:45.464
If it were known

37:45.464 --> 37:48.066
that a Nazi fired
at our Prince,

37:48.066 --> 37:49.735
that would be
an act of war,

37:49.735 --> 37:52.438
a war many in the Reich
would be happy to see

37:52.438 --> 37:56.342
but one our empire would
almost certainly lose.

37:56.342 --> 37:59.511
I do not deny your accusation,

37:59.511 --> 38:01.880
nor will I confirm it.

38:01.880 --> 38:05.050
I don't need you to,
Chief Inspector.

38:05.050 --> 38:08.787
You see, I have the name
of the assassin,

38:08.787 --> 38:10.656
the real assassin.

38:19.264 --> 38:20.766
Name your price.

38:22.167 --> 38:24.803
My price cannot be
paid with money,

38:24.803 --> 38:26.738
Chief Inspector,

38:26.738 --> 38:29.708
but it is very,
very high.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.034
Hello?

38:56.034 --> 38:57.536
Helen:
In here.

39:05.811 --> 39:07.078

39:08.547 --> 39:10.782

What a surprise.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.851
As I told you, I'm staying
in East Hampton.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.587
I thought I would drop in
and see you on my way home.

He's been regaling
the children

39:17.288 --> 39:18.957
with his war stories.

39:18.957 --> 39:21.793
I must admit to
a certain nostalgia.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.495
The duty
of maintaining order

39:23.495 --> 39:24.896
is never as thrilling

39:24.896 --> 39:26.432
as the challenge
of establishing it.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.299
Those tribal chieftains
in Africa--

39:28.299 --> 39:30.301
certainly very fierce.

39:30.301 --> 39:33.572
Subhuman, of course,
but proud.

39:33.572 --> 39:36.274
It required great strength
of will to subdue them.

39:36.274 --> 39:39.077
I can't wait until I'm
old enough to see Africa.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.512
One day, my boy.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.751
Can I fix you another drink,
Reinhard?

39:45.751 --> 39:49.187
I wish I could, but my
family's expecting me.

39:49.187 --> 39:51.457
Could I have a word
in private?

39:52.458 --> 39:54.125
Certainly.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.797
So...

39:58.797 --> 40:02.033
what can I, uh,
help you with?

40:03.669 --> 40:05.904
I was concerned, John,

40:05.904 --> 40:07.673
after I heard
about the death

40:07.673 --> 40:09.407
of Captain Connolly
this afternoon.

40:09.407 --> 40:13.011
Yes. It's
a terrible thing, that,

40:13.011 --> 40:14.212
suicide.

40:14.212 --> 40:16.014
Had he been depressed?

40:16.014 --> 40:18.817
Not that I know of.

40:18.817 --> 40:22.654
I guess you never can tell
what's going on inside a man.

40:24.523 --> 40:26.925
No. You can't.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.963
John, I'm going hunting
in the morning.

40:31.963 --> 40:35.200
I'd be delighted
if you would join me.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.902
That's very kind of you,

40:36.902 --> 40:38.670
but I'm afraid I'm working
tomorrow morning.

40:38.670 --> 40:41.072
Work can wait.
I insist.

40:43.441 --> 40:44.876
Very well, then.

40:46.244 --> 40:49.247
Your boy Thomas,
he's a fine young man.

40:49.247 --> 40:50.616
Bring him along.

40:51.983 --> 40:54.219
Let's leave our families
out of this, shall we?

40:57.122 --> 40:58.990
The address is here.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.097
Is 7 too early?

41:09.034 --> 41:10.769
7's fine.

Yes. It is.

He'll come.

Why is this one
so important anyway?

No.
