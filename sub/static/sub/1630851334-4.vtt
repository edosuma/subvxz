WEBVTT

00:33.575 --> 00:34.659
Thank you.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.172
-Gi-hun, wait.
-Huh?

00:50.759 --> 00:51.676
Nothing.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.971
You saved me.

00:55.055 --> 00:55.930
What?

00:57.390 --> 00:59.809
You're the reason
I got through this round.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.329
-Sirs, you made it!
-Oh.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.295
I'm glad you made it.

01:27.796 --> 01:28.838
I was really worried.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.217
It will take a whole lot more
killing Gi-hun. Hah!

01:32.300 --> 01:34.636
I got Ssangmun-dong running
through this heart, huh?

01:36.012 --> 01:38.014
Are you holding up all right here, mister?

01:38.098 --> 01:39.516
I'm okay. Yes.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.477
All thanks to your sharp thinking.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.854
I'm sorry.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.898
I was wrong to suggest separating.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.652
Ah, don't say that.

01:51.486 --> 01:53.279
How could you know what it was?

01:53.363 --> 01:55.240
Choosing the umbrella was my call.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.992
-Don't worry, okay?
-Mm.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.245
Yeah, the whole team made it.

02:02.413 --> 02:03.873
Attention, players.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.709
I will now announce
the results of the second game.

02:10.004 --> 02:13.633
Out of the 187 players who participated,

02:14.134 --> 02:17.053
79 players were eliminated.

02:35.864 --> 02:40.410
The prize money accumulated this round
is 7.9 billion won.

02:40.910 --> 02:46.875
The total prize money accumulated so far
is now 34.8 billion won.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.509
EPISODE 4
STICK TO THE TEAM

02:56.593 --> 02:59.262
Attention.
Your mealtime begins now.

02:59.929 --> 03:03.266
All players, please form a line
in the center of the room.

03:19.407 --> 03:20.533
This is all we get?

03:27.874 --> 03:29.000
Asshole.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.337
I came just close to dying.

03:32.837 --> 03:35.965
And what do I get for all of that?
An egg for a meal.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.604
Are they kidding us with this shit?

03:53.024 --> 03:55.526
Hey. Sorry, I'm coming through.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.028
Coming through.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.529
Excuse me. Thank you.

03:59.572 --> 04:00.823
Excuse me.

04:01.532 --> 04:04.202
Hey, miss, what are you doing, huh?

04:08.873 --> 04:10.625
Shut your mouth and grab an egg.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.524
Uh, I didn't get anything.

04:34.607 --> 04:35.733
Where's the rest?

04:36.526 --> 04:38.444
Hey, we didn't get our meals either.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.530
One, two, three, four, five.

04:40.613 --> 04:41.990
Five meals are missing, sir.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.575
We prepared food
for the exact number of players.

04:44.659 --> 04:45.910
Then where is ours?

04:45.994 --> 04:47.787
Please, sir, we need to eat!

04:47.870 --> 04:50.832
-It was prepared for the exact number.
-Excuse me.

04:53.876 --> 04:54.711
It was them. They…

04:56.504 --> 04:59.132
skip the line and got seconds. I saw it.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.221
Hey, what's the matter, everybody? Jeez.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.515
You never see a guy eat before,
is that it?

05:07.598 --> 05:09.475
Shit.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.896
Who do you think you are?

05:13.980 --> 05:15.606
That's my food you just ate.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.985
Ah. So, uh, is this yours?

05:19.819 --> 05:20.903
Is your name on it?

05:21.863 --> 05:23.364
'Cause I sure don't see anything.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.202
I'm sorry.

05:28.786 --> 05:29.787
Give me that.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.081
Give it back. It's mine.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.374
Give it back to me!

05:38.296 --> 05:40.089
You little shit, goddamn it.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.759
Why did you break it, you jerk?
How was this, huh?

05:44.427 --> 05:47.638
How come a scrawny guy like you
is so greedy about food?

05:47.722 --> 05:49.057
You piece of shit!

05:49.140 --> 05:53.811
Hey, listen up. You should learn to share.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.189
Is it too hard, you dumbass?

05:56.773 --> 06:00.276
You bastard!
What the hell? You shithead.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.154
Shit.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.589
Hey, you okay? Hey, wake up.

06:32.183 --> 06:33.101
He's gone.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.528
Uh, hello, guards.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.823
Can someone do something?

06:50.952 --> 06:52.328
Hey, didn't you hear that?

06:54.455 --> 06:55.706
A person died.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.000
That man there just died.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.089
Look, that man was killed.

07:03.172 --> 07:05.883
That bastard…
That bastard just killed him.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.139
He just killed someone over there!

07:13.474 --> 07:14.600
He just died!

07:15.476 --> 07:17.019
Can't you hear me, huh?

07:18.646 --> 07:20.189
Help us now!

07:20.273 --> 07:21.983
A man just died!

07:22.066 --> 07:24.485
We shouldn't be
killing each other like this!

07:28.197 --> 07:30.658
Player 271, eliminated.

08:42.813 --> 08:43.814
You there.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.025
Why aren't you doing your job?

08:51.239 --> 08:52.365
I'm sorry, sir.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.117
How may I be of service?

08:58.746 --> 09:00.081
Did you forget the rules?

09:00.581 --> 09:03.209
You do not speak
unless your superior allows you to.

09:31.070 --> 09:32.113
Attention, staff.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.614
-Lights-out in 30 minutes.
-Hurry! It'll be bedtime soon.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.700
Please return to the quarters now.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.789
We can't fall asleep tonight, okay?

09:42.373 --> 09:44.166
Who knows what someone else may try.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.338
Look at them. It looks like
they're planning something.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.091
If they try to attack someone,

09:53.384 --> 09:55.136
let's group together and fight them.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.222
Come to our side if anything goes wrong.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.016
Okay, I will.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.020
Sir, wake up.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.899
Wake up, sir.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.155
Sorry, but you really can't go to sleep
after lights-out, understand?

10:14.905 --> 10:15.781
Why?

10:15.865 --> 10:18.909
We gotta keep an eye out.
It will be dangerous.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.162
And we'll come here if anything goes down.

10:21.245 --> 10:23.372
Uh. Okay.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.717
Hey, pickpocket.

10:37.386 --> 10:38.638
Are you okay?

10:39.513 --> 10:42.558
It looked like you and that thug
really had it out for each other.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.061
So what?

10:45.144 --> 10:49.148
Tonight, if anything happens,
we'll all meet in my bed right there.

10:51.525 --> 10:52.485
Are you in?

10:56.947 --> 10:58.240
I don't trust people.

10:59.617 --> 11:02.244
And that's twice as true for anyone
who'd end up in here. Got it?

11:02.328 --> 11:04.080
You think that's how it works, huh?

11:06.749 --> 11:09.251
Listen, you don't trust people here
because you can.

11:10.252 --> 11:12.672
You do it because
you don't have anybody else.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.640
Where is the delivery team?

11:36.946 --> 11:38.864
Number 28,
why are you alone?

11:39.407 --> 11:40.866
Number 29 didn't show up.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.868
-Was there an accident?
-I don't know.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.079
Then you'll need to deliver this alone.

11:45.746 --> 11:48.374
I can't go underwater
by myself. It's too dangerous.

11:48.457 --> 11:49.875
Enough! Tell me now.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.002
The next game, what is it?

12:02.346 --> 12:03.514
Are you sure?

12:04.724 --> 12:07.893
If I get eliminated,
then I can't do all of this.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.396
Worry about that
after you survive the night.

12:11.605 --> 12:12.565
What's tonight?

12:12.648 --> 12:14.066
Fighting will break out.

12:14.775 --> 12:18.237
We gave you less food on purpose
to make you all fight each other.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.532
Weeding out the weaklings
before the next game begins.

12:21.615 --> 12:22.825
It's all part of the game.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.202
You know we can't
protect you when you're in there.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.664
Go back to the players
and find a way to live.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.458
Way to live?

12:30.541 --> 12:32.084
Stick with the strongest.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.128
That's the only way you'll live.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.425
You're a strong team.

13:23.552 --> 13:24.595
Let me join.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.847
Why should we?

13:29.600 --> 13:31.352
Tell us, what are you good at?

13:31.435 --> 13:32.603
I'm a doctor out there.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.605
You might need me.

13:34.688 --> 13:35.648
So?

13:36.607 --> 13:39.235
You're gonna come give me a shot
if I get sick?

13:44.365 --> 13:46.784
Go sit somewhere in the corner,
come lights-out.

13:46.867 --> 13:48.828
Don't breathe or make a noise.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.163
If I hear you breathe…

13:54.124 --> 13:55.459
then I'll come for you.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.676
I know what the next game is.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.305
Players,
lights-out in two minutes.

14:10.558 --> 14:14.603
Attention, staff.
The special game will begin momentarily.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.606
Will all managers, soldiers and workers,

14:17.690 --> 14:20.359
please make your way
to your designated locations.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.612
Let me repeat the instruction.

14:24.154 --> 14:27.408
Will all managers, soldiers and workers,

14:27.491 --> 14:30.411
please make your way
to your designated locations.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.672
Lights-out in 30 seconds.

14:55.895 --> 15:00.608
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

15:00.691 --> 15:05.613
five, four, three, two, one.

15:42.524 --> 15:44.234
You saw us, huh?

16:01.585 --> 16:02.586
Do it.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.910
Ah!

17:22.791 --> 17:24.084
You asshole!

18:01.330 --> 18:03.540
-Gi-hun, are you okay?
-Yeah. Thanks, Sang-woo.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.626
Where's the old man?

18:06.210 --> 18:08.003
-I'm not sure.
-Gi-hun.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.480
-He's not here.
-Oh, no.

18:27.064 --> 18:30.400
Hey, old man! Are you there?

18:30.901 --> 18:31.902
Old man!

18:52.673 --> 18:54.091
Let me out!

19:18.198 --> 19:19.616
You're here.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.826
Like you said.

19:42.055 --> 19:43.765
Hey, Ssangmun-dong, what are you doing?

19:44.516 --> 19:47.352
We're just helping cull the herd.

19:47.936 --> 19:49.855
She's our teammate, you got that?

19:51.899 --> 19:53.150
Teammate?

19:54.610 --> 19:57.237
All of you, stop this.

19:58.113 --> 20:01.408
I'm… I… I'm scared.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.913
We are all gonna die in here!

20:06.622 --> 20:11.793
Everyone, every single one of us
is going to die!

20:11.877 --> 20:15.380
Please. I'm so scared.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.967
Stop this madness!

20:19.051 --> 20:21.220
-End it.
-If you keep this going,

20:21.303 --> 20:23.680
then we're all going to die in here!

20:57.965 --> 20:59.258
Drop your weapon.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.344
Turn around.

21:25.033 --> 21:29.538
Player 277, eliminated.
Player 74, eliminated.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.290
Player 198, eliminated.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.416
Player 87, eliminated.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.460
-Player 456.
-Player 222, eliminated.

21:35.544 --> 21:38.046
-Is there a man named Hwang In-ho here?
-Player 301, eliminated.

21:38.714 --> 21:41.842
-Player 416, eliminated.
-We don't use our names in this place.

21:41.925 --> 21:44.136
Player 361, eliminated.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.306
Player 328, eliminated.

21:48.056 --> 21:50.183
Player 103, eliminated.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.686
Player 444, eliminated.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.479
Player 6, eliminated.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.231
Player 206, eliminated.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.442
Player 233, eliminated.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.861
Player 239, eliminated.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.012
Are you all right?

22:28.430 --> 22:29.306
Huh?

22:29.389 --> 22:32.684
All of the… That was dangerous.
When did you get up there?

22:33.310 --> 22:35.687
We were worried about you, sir,
when you disappeared.

22:35.771 --> 22:37.898
Nobody here got hurt so that's good.

22:42.027 --> 22:45.614
Uh, well, at this point,
we should know what to call each other.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.575
Why don't we go around
and tell each other our names now.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.535
I know your name already, though.

22:50.619 --> 22:51.495
Ssangmun-dong.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.916
Ssangmun-dong is just my hometown.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.085
The name is Seong Gi-hun.

22:58.168 --> 22:59.920
Seong Gi-hun of Ssangmun-dong.

23:01.838 --> 23:03.548
So then, what about your name?

23:04.132 --> 23:04.966
Ali.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.135
Ali Abdul.

23:07.219 --> 23:08.762
And where are you from?

23:08.845 --> 23:10.055
Pakistan.

23:10.138 --> 23:11.139
Pakistan?

23:11.932 --> 23:13.016
Where is that?

23:13.100 --> 23:14.184
North of India.

23:14.267 --> 23:15.352
He's right.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.648
Of course, he is.
This man here went to SNU--

23:19.731 --> 23:20.982
Cho Sang-woo.

23:31.284 --> 23:32.411
Come on, really?

23:34.287 --> 23:35.997
We're all teammates here now.

23:36.623 --> 23:40.877
We should really know about each other,
build up a little trust, okay?

23:44.047 --> 23:45.048
Kang Sae-byeok.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.216
Sae-byeok?

23:47.092 --> 23:48.385
That's a pretty name.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.554
Though I'm not sure how well it fits.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.849
And what is your name, sir?
If you don't mind.

23:56.393 --> 23:57.352
What?

23:58.603 --> 23:59.729
My name?

24:01.440 --> 24:02.357
Oh.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.151
It…

24:09.197 --> 24:10.115
Uh…

24:11.074 --> 24:12.409
Let me think.

24:15.203 --> 24:17.330
Hold on, it…

24:18.957 --> 24:20.000
So…

24:21.293 --> 24:22.377
It…

24:23.503 --> 24:24.588
They call me…

24:24.671 --> 24:26.673
It's okay.

24:26.756 --> 24:29.468
Hey, old man, you must be
really shook up today.

24:30.510 --> 24:31.636
You know when I'm stressed,

24:31.720 --> 24:33.638
my home address
slips right out of my head.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.765
Along with my social security.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.478
It'll be okay
once you get some rest.

24:48.528 --> 24:49.821
Damn it.

24:49.905 --> 24:52.365
That hurts. Doctor, my ass.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.994
I'm almost done here.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.915
Thankfully, it didn't go in too far.
You'll be fine.

24:59.998 --> 25:03.793
Outside, I'll be able to treat it
at the hospital, okay?

25:05.003 --> 25:06.922
Pretentious dickhead.

25:07.881 --> 25:10.592
You must have lost your practice
to be in this place.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.011
I will get out of here.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.556
With that money.

25:20.769 --> 25:21.937
Those bastards.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.483
Why they make it so we could kill
other players and then end it like this?

25:26.566 --> 25:28.068
Games will be over.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.278
We could've ended this whole thing
right there and then.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.864
If we kill everyone else,
what happens to us?

25:34.241 --> 25:36.826
And won't we get to…

25:37.786 --> 25:39.120
take all that money?

25:41.122 --> 25:45.001
We'll be able to try and kill them again
as long as we don't die.

25:45.794 --> 25:48.296
Right, Doc? In the next game.

25:52.092 --> 25:53.176
All done.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.680
I guess this is why everyone says

25:56.763 --> 25:59.057
you really should have a doctor
in your family.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.020
We got rid of quite a few.

26:04.729 --> 26:09.234
Players down from 107 to 80,
that means we killed 27?

26:11.152 --> 26:12.445
Right, old man?

26:12.529 --> 26:14.239
"Old man"?

26:14.322 --> 26:16.157
You're gonna call me that?

26:16.241 --> 26:17.993
You seem way older than me.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.119
Oh, yeah?

26:19.744 --> 26:20.954
Tell me how old do I look?

26:21.037 --> 26:21.997
Forty-nine.

26:23.748 --> 26:26.751
Oh, please. I guess I shouldn't have
lent you that lighter then, huh?

26:26.835 --> 26:27.752
Thirty-nine?

26:28.336 --> 26:29.462
Old man, one more chance.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.257
Uh…

26:33.466 --> 26:34.342
Nineteen?

26:37.512 --> 26:38.597
Bingo.

26:41.349 --> 26:42.934
You're a quick learner.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.898
But what's my…

26:48.982 --> 26:50.400
reward for guessing?

26:53.194 --> 26:55.697
I'll go think about it
in the restroom, okay?

27:07.417 --> 27:08.668
I'm going to the bathroom too.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.385
Old man.

28:00.053 --> 28:02.555
You and that doctor are hiding something.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.728
There's nothing to hide.

28:21.282 --> 28:22.367
Old man.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.328
Do you…

28:27.622 --> 28:30.125
swear to stick together right to the end?

28:32.168 --> 28:34.421
Just tell me that you will.

28:36.005 --> 28:38.049
Okay. I promise you.

28:39.342 --> 28:42.137
Together, you and I will get out of here.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.775
What's your name, old man?

28:59.863 --> 29:00.989
Why?

29:02.866 --> 29:04.367
I just wanna know it.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.083
Deok-su.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.170
Jang Deok-su.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.109
Deok-su.

29:41.529 --> 29:43.156
You betray me…

29:45.492 --> 29:47.118
I'll kill you, okay?

29:53.041 --> 29:54.876
You're the reason that I think…

29:56.127 --> 29:57.462
I might die tonight.

30:13.561 --> 30:17.065
Attention, staff,
it's now time for you to go to sleep.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.443
Congratulations on a good day's work.

30:31.871 --> 30:35.708
SHAPES, RANK, MASKED LEADER,
GUN MASSACRE,

30:35.792 --> 30:40.380
RIOT, ABETTING MURDER, MY BROTHER

31:01.025 --> 31:02.610
Morse code?

31:08.825 --> 31:09.951
Number 29.

31:33.933 --> 31:34.976
Hey, old man.

31:36.352 --> 31:37.186
Huh?

31:37.270 --> 31:39.814
Did you stay up all night?

31:40.481 --> 31:43.401
I thought they would attack again
or something.

31:43.484 --> 31:46.112
Old man, but you must be
so exhausted already.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.907
It's all right.

31:49.657 --> 31:53.286
You don't really need that much sleep
when you're old.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.916
And I didn't help
when they went after everyone

31:58.750 --> 32:01.294
but keeping night watch,
well, I can do that.

32:05.381 --> 32:09.052
Attention, players.
The third game will begin momentarily.

32:09.135 --> 32:11.012
Please follow the staff's instructions

32:11.095 --> 32:13.598
and swiftly make your way
towards the game hall.

32:13.681 --> 32:15.725
Let me repeat the instructions.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.894
The third game will begin momentarily.

32:23.608 --> 32:27.570
Beginning head count now.
Please wait in front of your door.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.244
Head count complete.

32:50.385 --> 32:53.471
Players,
welcome to the third game.

32:54.097 --> 32:56.933
For this game, you will play in teams.

32:57.642 --> 33:01.729
All players, please divide yourselves
into teams of ten people.

33:02.230 --> 33:06.317
Your time limit will be ten minutes.
Ten minutes.

33:07.235 --> 33:09.112
Let me repeat the instructions.

33:09.737 --> 33:12.281
For this game, you will play in teams.

33:12.949 --> 33:17.203
All players, please divide yourselves
into teams of ten people.

33:17.286 --> 33:21.124
Your time limit will be ten minutes.
Ten minutes.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.794
We need to get a bunch of men
who are well built.

33:24.877 --> 33:26.129
Oh, okay.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.673
What about the girl?

33:39.934 --> 33:42.562
Something that has teams of ten players.

33:42.645 --> 33:45.148
So maybe it's Tail Tag
or Why Did You Come to My House?

33:46.816 --> 33:48.651
Tail Tag means running is involved.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.863
Or it might just end up
being simply based on luck.

33:53.865 --> 33:54.741
What do you think?

33:56.409 --> 33:58.703
Our team already has a girl
and an older guy.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.372
I'm thinking we better get more men first.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.918
What if they make us play Gonggi
or Elastics? Then, what do we do?

34:06.002 --> 34:07.587
Girls are usually the good ones at that--

34:07.670 --> 34:10.757
That's true, but when it really comes
down to it, usually men are better.

34:11.632 --> 34:13.634
It's our lives we're betting on right now.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.262
And we gotta win.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.603
Five more people are needed.

34:24.145 --> 34:26.481
I see that we each
bring one guy to join us.

34:26.564 --> 34:27.732
Okay?

34:38.242 --> 34:39.452
Don't let them see.

34:41.162 --> 34:42.622
You'll seem weaker.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.515
Boss, excuse me.
Look, this guy wants to join us.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.142
Hey, go find more guys.

35:24.705 --> 35:25.665
Sir?

35:26.165 --> 35:28.000
Got a team yet? Are you taken?

35:28.084 --> 35:29.335
Huh? Uh, no.

35:29.418 --> 35:32.463
Come join ours then, sir. We have a team.

35:33.089 --> 35:34.590
Well, the thing is, though,

35:34.674 --> 35:39.178
so I can't join unless she does, too.

35:39.679 --> 35:40.596
Would you let her?

35:41.931 --> 35:43.224
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.351
Our team already has too many girls.

35:49.397 --> 35:52.984
Excuse me. Still picking who to join in?
You should come with us.

36:01.242 --> 36:02.368
Excuse me, sir.

36:03.494 --> 36:07.832
If you're not on a team yet,
perhaps you would like to join ours?

36:22.054 --> 36:23.389
Let's team up next time.

36:23.472 --> 36:24.724
Babe, wait!

36:26.392 --> 36:28.936
I don't get it.
Come on, you're just joking.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.564
My team is full. I'm sorry.

36:32.565 --> 36:34.192
We've got ten already.

36:35.610 --> 36:39.864
Old man. No, please, you can't do this.

36:40.615 --> 36:42.533
I'm sorry.

36:42.617 --> 36:43.743
I'll do anything.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.037
Babe, I swear I'll do better.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.456
Uh, I'm good at everything.
You know that's true.

36:48.539 --> 36:49.874
Just listen, okay?

36:51.167 --> 36:53.211
Let's split up just for this game,
all right?

36:53.294 --> 36:55.922
Then meet up with the next one, huh?

36:56.005 --> 36:57.924
But…

36:58.549 --> 37:00.384
do we really need to, though?

37:01.844 --> 37:03.763
You said we'd do this together.

37:04.555 --> 37:05.598
Babe.

37:06.474 --> 37:07.975
Can you really do this alone?

37:08.059 --> 37:11.646
I need you, old man. Can't you see that?

37:11.729 --> 37:13.356
Get off!

37:13.856 --> 37:16.692
God, this bitch is so pathetic.
Get your hands off me.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.320
And stop calling me "babe"
and "old man," huh!

37:19.403 --> 37:22.281
Call me that one more fucking time,
and I'll cut your goddamn throat out!

37:33.501 --> 37:35.044
You asshole.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.047
Just stop it. You were using me.

37:40.675 --> 37:41.676
Jang Deok-su.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.178
Goddamn you, scumbag.

37:45.429 --> 37:48.474
You betrayed me,
you're dead now. Got that?

37:48.557 --> 37:49.725
Oh, I'm so scared…

37:50.226 --> 37:51.560
Ms. Han Mi-nyeo.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.939
Well then, best of luck to you, huh?

37:56.899 --> 38:01.028
She's not worth it anyways.

38:06.033 --> 38:07.076
What do you want?

38:07.660 --> 38:08.661
Play with us.

38:14.166 --> 38:15.251
One.

38:16.919 --> 38:17.878
Two.

38:18.379 --> 38:19.213
Three.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.299
Four.

38:22.967 --> 38:23.968
Five.

38:24.468 --> 38:25.553
Six.

38:26.095 --> 38:27.096
Seven.

38:28.097 --> 38:29.140
Eight.

38:31.350 --> 38:32.518
Nine? Um…

38:33.227 --> 38:36.188
Wait, did someone not bring anyone?

38:36.272 --> 38:37.440
It was me. I didn't.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.486
What about you? Who brought you here?

38:43.904 --> 38:44.822
Her.

38:47.783 --> 38:49.660
I said to bring only men back here,
didn't I?

38:51.287 --> 38:52.413
This doesn't sound good.

38:53.497 --> 38:54.790
You want me to go?

38:55.291 --> 38:56.542
I'll go now.

38:56.625 --> 38:57.835
No, wait. Hold on.

38:58.794 --> 39:00.755
It's okay. Stay where you are.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.884
We don't even know what we're doing yet.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.511
And the time's almost over.

39:08.387 --> 39:11.182
At this point, let's just find
one more team and be done.

39:11.265 --> 39:13.642
We put together a weak team,
who would want to join it?

39:14.602 --> 39:16.437
That means that once the timer's done,

39:16.520 --> 39:18.230
we'll end up with anyone
that got kicked out.

39:18.314 --> 39:21.275
Well, nobody kicked me out, huh!

39:21.359 --> 39:24.195
I'll play with you
as a special deal here, okay?

39:24.278 --> 39:26.614
Man, you guys lucked out today. Yikes!

39:26.697 --> 39:29.658
I'll be way more help
than either of these wimpy little girls.

39:29.742 --> 39:33.788
Plus, I'm good at everything
except the things that I can't do.

39:37.291 --> 39:40.294
The time for forming your teams is over.

39:40.378 --> 39:43.339
All players, please line up
with your teammates

39:43.422 --> 39:45.591
-at the entrance to the game hall.
-Hold on.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.676
We're not gonna stay in here, though?

40:21.877 --> 40:25.798
I would now like
to welcome you all to the third game.

40:26.382 --> 40:29.343
Today's game is Tug-of-War.

40:30.594 --> 40:33.597
In order to win, you must pull the rope
towards your platform

40:33.681 --> 40:36.475
in an attempt to
drop your opponents down below.

40:46.902 --> 40:50.698
Now, I will draw numbers to decide
which two teams will play first.

40:52.074 --> 40:53.951
Everyone, please sit down.

40:59.623 --> 41:02.710
First, the team
that will play on the left tower.

41:07.006 --> 41:09.550
Team One. Team One, please stand up.

41:13.888 --> 41:17.057
And now, the team that will play
on the right tower.

41:20.436 --> 41:21.312
Team Seven.

41:21.395 --> 41:23.481
Team Seven, please stand up.

41:31.864 --> 41:35.326
Teams One and Seven
will be the first teams to play.

41:37.244 --> 41:39.872
Will both teams please go to your towers.

42:40.140 --> 42:41.058
Get them!

42:46.564 --> 42:48.023
Oh! Oh, shit!

42:51.360 --> 42:52.528
Shit!

42:57.032 --> 42:58.576
Get them!

43:41.118 --> 43:43.996
The following players, Player 245,

43:44.079 --> 43:48.375
Player 120, Player 37, Player 408,

43:48.459 --> 43:52.963
Player 27, Player 273, Player 58,

43:53.047 --> 43:59.470
Player 243, Player 327,
and Player 241 are eliminated.

44:36.173 --> 44:38.926
I will now draw
the teams for the next round.

44:39.009 --> 44:39.968
Team Four.

44:44.556 --> 44:45.557
Team Five.

44:57.986 --> 44:59.905
Damn it.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.032
All men.

45:02.116 --> 45:04.868
Team Four and Team Five,
please go to your towers.

45:12.292 --> 45:15.921
Oh, man. I was looking forward
to killing you guys.

46:01.049 --> 46:04.094
Come on. Don't lose your spirit.

46:05.554 --> 46:09.099
Tug-of-War needs more
than just raw strength.

46:09.183 --> 46:12.478
Well then, what it's about, huh?
We just go out and speak to them?

46:12.561 --> 46:15.564
All you need is a good strategy
in Tug-of-War

46:15.647 --> 46:17.191
and combined with good teamwork,

46:17.274 --> 46:20.319
you'll be able to win
when you are against stronger teams.

46:20.402 --> 46:22.446
Only one thing can help us now.

46:22.529 --> 46:24.281
It's the Lord himself, I know it.

46:24.364 --> 46:26.533
You can barely stay standing, old man.

46:26.617 --> 46:28.869
So shut up and keep
all your strength, okay?

46:30.621 --> 46:33.165
Wait a minute,
let's hear what the old man says.

46:34.666 --> 46:38.837
Okay, when I was young,
we always like Tug-of-War.

46:38.921 --> 46:40.923
It's a game I know well.

46:41.006 --> 46:44.092
And back then, I would always win,

46:45.135 --> 46:48.972
even if there was a wrestler
on the other team,

46:49.056 --> 46:52.643
and it seemed the odds
were stuck against us.

46:55.437 --> 46:57.105
Listen closely,

46:57.189 --> 47:01.193
and I'll tell you how my team and I
were able to win

47:01.276 --> 47:03.612
even when it seemed impossible.

47:07.533 --> 47:11.161
First off, having a good leader
is very important.

47:11.787 --> 47:13.872
The person is at the front

47:13.956 --> 47:17.709
and keeps an eye on
how the other team is performing.

47:17.793 --> 47:21.839
And the rest of the team focuses
on the back of their leader's head

47:21.922 --> 47:23.465
and follows their lead.

47:23.549 --> 47:27.845
If the leader seems weak or looks like
their spirit is beginning to falter,

47:28.428 --> 47:30.848
then the game is already over.

47:32.307 --> 47:35.060
And then at the end of the rope,

47:35.143 --> 47:38.272
you'll need to have someone strong
and dependable

47:38.355 --> 47:39.940
like the anchor of a ship.

47:41.316 --> 47:45.445
After that, it's all about
how you arrange the rest of your team.

47:45.529 --> 47:48.198
If one player is
on the right side of the rope,

47:48.282 --> 47:52.494
then the next one should be on the left,
all the way down the rope.

47:54.246 --> 47:58.959
Both of your feet
should be facing straight forward,

47:59.042 --> 48:02.421
and then, hold the rope in your armpits.

48:02.963 --> 48:06.758
That way, everyone can put in
all of their strength.

48:07.467 --> 48:12.180
Finally, and this is absolutely
the most important thing.

48:12.681 --> 48:16.184
Once the game begins,
for the first ten seconds…

48:16.852 --> 48:19.271
…you have to hold your ground.

48:19.813 --> 48:23.317
You should lean back,
practically lie down.

48:23.400 --> 48:27.154
Push your lower abdomen up to the sky,
as hard as you can.

48:27.237 --> 48:29.823
And throw your head back to the point

48:29.907 --> 48:33.410
where you can almost see the groin
of the person behind you.

48:33.493 --> 48:38.248
If you do that, the other team
won't be able to pull us to their side.

48:38.332 --> 48:41.209
Just hold like this for ten seconds.

48:41.710 --> 48:45.047
Then the opposing team
will start to get frustrated

48:45.130 --> 48:48.008
because they are thinking,
"Why won't they budge?"

48:48.592 --> 48:51.845
Because they believed
that they were much stronger.

48:52.471 --> 48:54.765
If you can hold out for that long,

48:54.848 --> 48:58.852
you will be able to catch a moment
in your opponents' hold,

48:58.936 --> 49:01.313
and their rhythm breaks.

49:03.148 --> 49:04.441
Now's our chance!

49:27.297 --> 49:29.216
Pull it together!

49:55.158 --> 49:57.744
We're losing! Goddamn it! Do something!

50:03.583 --> 50:05.335
Get yourselves together and listen!

50:06.086 --> 50:08.839
Let's try something.
Take three steps up when I signal.

50:08.922 --> 50:11.800
Up? What now? But that's the edge!

50:12.300 --> 50:13.802
Look, just trust me and they'll fall!

50:13.885 --> 50:15.345
There's no way I'll do that!

50:15.429 --> 50:16.805
We might as well try!

50:16.888 --> 50:18.557
No way! I can't do it!

50:18.640 --> 50:20.225
Move up or you'll die!

50:20.726 --> 50:21.977
On count of three!

50:22.060 --> 50:23.895
One! Two!

50:23.979 --> 50:25.689
Three!
