00:03.570 --> 00:07.040
.
Give it up for
our Season 21 coaches!

00:07.040 --> 00:09.042
Yeah!

00:12.679 --> 00:14.181
Hello!

00:14.181 --> 00:15.349
Whoo!

00:15.349 --> 00:18.252
Where's Blake?

00:18.252 --> 00:20.020
Look at this.

00:22.456 --> 00:26.260
And now...

00:26.260 --> 00:31.164
with over 200 artists coached
and 29 number‐one hits

00:31.164 --> 00:34.168
and your eight‐time
"Voice" champion...

00:34.168 --> 00:35.269
Oh, my God.

00:35.269 --> 00:39.072
...King Blake Shelton!

00:48.448 --> 00:50.484
Yeah!

00:53.120 --> 00:56.323
Oh, hey.
Hey. How y'all doing?

00:56.323 --> 00:58.358
Yes!

01:02.429 --> 01:06.033
I think we're all
equally exhausted

01:06.033 --> 01:09.536
by the confidence
of Blake Shelton.

01:09.536 --> 01:12.072
But I think
he underestimates me.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.041
Just because I'm new,
it doesn't mean

01:14.041 --> 01:17.010
that I won't bring home
a winner.

01:17.010 --> 01:19.546
90 seconds till
our Blind Auditions begin.

01:19.546 --> 01:21.381
Raquel, your big moment is here.
How are you feeling?

01:21.381 --> 01:23.150
It's time!
I feel good.

01:23.150 --> 01:26.186
I feel like young Raquel
would be so proud of me.
Mm‐hmm.

01:26.186 --> 01:29.189
That's what I'm trying
to keep thinking about.

01:38.065 --> 01:39.466
My name is Raquel Trinidad,

01:39.466 --> 01:42.202
I'm 23 years old,
and I'm from Tampa, Florida,

01:42.202 --> 01:44.438
but I'm currently living
in Miami.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.174
I love living here.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.042
It's really,
really energetic and lively,

01:49.042 --> 01:52.145
and that's kind of how I am,
so it feels like home.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.518
I'm definitely a free spirit.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.686
I consider myself
kind of a hippie.

01:59.686 --> 02:03.190
I'm also an artist,
and my specialty is glass art.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.393
The breaking of
the glass definitely

02:06.393 --> 02:08.295
relieves a lot of my tension.

02:08.295 --> 02:12.399
It keeps me tranquil when I'm
usually constantly energetic.

02:12.399 --> 02:16.403
But singing is my main focus,
for sure.

02:16.403 --> 02:17.671
Ever since I was little,

02:17.671 --> 02:19.506
my whole family
has been musical.

02:19.506 --> 02:21.675
My dad actually
plays the congas.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.178
He's always the head
of the drum circles,

02:24.178 --> 02:26.246
and I like to sing
along with him.

02:26.246 --> 02:28.649
I'm really proud of you.
You're my baby girl.
I love you.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.517
I love you, too.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.419
When I was 11 years old,

02:32.419 --> 02:36.190
I got the opportunity to do
some singing voiceover work

02:36.190 --> 02:38.025
on "Dora the Explorer."

02:38.025 --> 02:41.261
It was actually a special,
and Shakira was a feature on it.

02:41.261 --> 02:43.430
Ever since then,
I've never stopped.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.333
About a month after I turned 19,
I actually moved to Miami

02:46.333 --> 02:48.435
to try to pursue
my music career.

02:48.435 --> 02:51.371
I spent about two years
gigging around Miami

02:51.371 --> 02:53.674
trying to play
my original songs.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.509
You kind of just feel like
you're singing in the background

02:55.509 --> 02:57.544
sometimes and trying
to get their attention

02:57.544 --> 02:59.780
while they're doing
their own thing.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.182
So, I'm currently a driver
for a rideshare company.

03:03.383 --> 03:06.520
Hey.
Hi!

03:06.520 --> 03:08.689
Usually, I'll play
some of my own music

03:08.689 --> 03:10.524
to try to promote it.
We jam out.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.126
I see them dancing
in the backseat,

03:13.126 --> 03:14.328
and I love that.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.196
I feel like
I'm helping the community,

03:16.196 --> 03:18.031
and I also have
a lot of free time,

03:18.031 --> 03:20.234
and I write
when there's nothing to do.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.238
I have so much fun at work
every day,

03:24.238 --> 03:27.074
but, of course,
this has always been my dream

03:27.074 --> 03:28.175
and my passion.

03:28.175 --> 03:29.676
For my blind audition,

03:29.676 --> 03:32.045
I'll be singing
"I Wish" by Stevie Wonder.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.782
So, that's definitely
channeling my soulful aura.

03:35.782 --> 03:38.685
After so many years of working
to be an independent artist,

03:38.685 --> 03:41.522
"The Voice" is by far
the biggest opportunity

03:41.522 --> 03:43.190
I've ever had in my life.

03:43.190 --> 03:45.192
There she is!
Yay!

03:45.192 --> 03:46.693
If one of those chairs turns,

03:46.693 --> 03:48.996
everything is going to change.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.232
I'm ready, Ari.

Oh, Raquel, you did it!

05:34.434 --> 05:35.669
Yeah!

05:35.669 --> 05:38.005
Hello, and welcome to
"The Voice."

05:38.005 --> 05:40.140
What is your name
and where are you from?

05:40.140 --> 05:42.309
My name is Raquel Trinidad,

05:42.309 --> 05:44.011
and I am originally from
Tampa, Florida,

05:44.011 --> 05:45.512
but I live in Miami, Florida.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.247
All right.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.383
Wow.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.485
Blake, what do you have
to say for yourself, sir?

05:51.485 --> 05:54.054
Sorry, I didn't hit
my button, Raquel.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.055
It's okay.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.256
Hey,
that's Ariana Grande.

05:56.256 --> 05:59.059
Look how awesome she is,
by the way.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.527
Oh, stop it.

06:00.527 --> 06:02.062
What's happening?
Why is he being nice?

06:02.062 --> 06:03.463
Never trust him.
I‐I don't.

06:05.098 --> 06:08.035
I can have an unbiased
opinion here

06:08.035 --> 06:10.437
and try to help you
choose Ariana

06:10.437 --> 06:11.438
as your coach.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.040
Oh, my goodness. Oh.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.374
Because I really think

06:14.374 --> 06:18.045
she is going to kick
some butt this season...

06:18.045 --> 06:19.446
Oh.
...and I don't want
to see you end up

06:19.446 --> 06:21.148
with two coaches
that are jaded,

06:21.148 --> 06:23.016
that have been here for a while,
that have proven...

06:23.016 --> 06:24.451
Don't listen to him,
Raquel.

06:24.451 --> 06:27.187
...season after season
that they can't win.

06:27.187 --> 06:30.257
I've won like three
or four times.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.392
I won my first season here.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.695
Now, the jury's out
on Ariana.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.396
You know,
we don't know.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.266
I'm in very uncomfortable
position.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.168
I loved that.
I was moved.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.437
Your voice is like
a breath of fresh air,

06:43.437 --> 06:45.205
the precision
of your runs,

06:45.205 --> 06:48.308
and then turning around
to see you was so exciting.

06:48.308 --> 06:50.177
Please pick me.
I beg you.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.346
I would love
to be your coach

06:52.346 --> 06:54.314
because I would love to just
help you execute

06:54.314 --> 06:56.183
the vision that you have
for yourself.

06:56.183 --> 07:00.454
You sound like you're
from, like, the '60s,

07:00.454 --> 07:03.423
but at the same time today,
and I love that.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.691
Selfishly, I feel like
I would know...

07:04.691 --> 07:06.193
♪ What to do with that

07:06.193 --> 07:08.195
♪ And I would like
to have you ♪

07:08.195 --> 07:09.563
That's a great compliment
because

07:09.563 --> 07:11.565
that's actually what I'm
trying to, like, implement ‐‐

07:11.565 --> 07:14.234
more jazzy and soulful
from the old school.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.269
And you do it very well.

07:15.269 --> 07:16.403
Yeah.
Thank you.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.005
I've spent my career
trying to do that,

07:18.005 --> 07:20.040
and I would love to help you
navigate that

07:20.040 --> 07:23.443
if you want to do it
with Team Legend.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.512
You do some
super soulful runs,

07:25.512 --> 07:27.514
but your voice
is also flexible.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.183
It seems like
you could do pop.

07:29.183 --> 07:31.285
You could do all kinds
of things, if you want to.

07:31.285 --> 07:34.688
And I would love
to coach you.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.056
Thank you.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.426
Hi!

07:39.426 --> 07:43.363
I don't know if I've
ever heard somebody do
a run as fast as you.

07:43.363 --> 07:47.067
Ooh, thank you.
Like, your runs were so quick
and crisp and clean...

07:47.067 --> 07:48.435
Yes.
...it was insane.

07:48.435 --> 07:51.271
I just want you to know
you are so incredibly talented.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.773
I loved it
from the beginning.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.508
You had a nice presence,
but you weren't overwhelming.

07:54.508 --> 07:57.311
Even saving your range for
the very end was really smart.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.512
Thank you.
And then turning around

07:58.512 --> 08:00.380
and seeing you strut,
you're an entertainer,

08:00.380 --> 08:02.249
and I'm so glad
you're on the show,

08:02.249 --> 08:04.551
and you would look really cute
in this jacket

08:04.551 --> 08:07.187
'cause it's turquoise.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.057
Raquel, who do you pick
as your coach?

08:15.262 --> 08:16.463
Um...

08:16.463 --> 08:18.065
Just say it!

08:28.108 --> 08:29.343
.
♪ This is "The Voice"Welcome back.

08:29.343 --> 08:33.413
Raquel, who do you pick
as your coach?

08:33.413 --> 08:34.414
Just say it!

08:37.251 --> 08:40.521
Um...

08:40.521 --> 08:42.256

08:42.256 --> 08:44.391
Oh, my God.
Whoa!

08:44.391 --> 08:47.027
Whoo!

08:47.027 --> 08:49.129
I'm so excited.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.164
I love Raquel.
She's unique.

08:51.164 --> 08:54.001
She pays homage to the greats

08:54.001 --> 08:57.738
while still being mainstream
and youthful and is spectacular.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.339
This is your lunchbox.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.308
She is super infectious,

09:01.308 --> 09:04.044
and I think the world's going
to fall in love with her.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.779
There's a moment when she did
something, I was like,

09:05.779 --> 09:07.047
"Oh, she really
loves Ariana."

09:07.047 --> 09:08.515
Really?
I heard you in her.

09:08.515 --> 09:11.518
That's a compliment to me
because I ‐‐ I loved her.
Yeah.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.320
That was great.
I'm having a moment.

09:13.320 --> 09:16.023
Have it, live it, swim in it.
Oh, I'm swimming in it.

09:16.023 --> 09:19.259
Can we talk about
how cool she looked?

09:19.259 --> 09:21.028
I know, I know.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.297
I feel like Blake might be
sucking up to Ariana.

09:23.297 --> 09:25.732
I think Blake is always
up to his old tricks.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.268
You can't trust him, and I don't
know what his game is yet,

09:28.268 --> 09:29.303
but I know it's a game.

09:29.303 --> 09:31.605
Whee!

09:33.273 --> 09:35.042
One minute, one minute.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.743
I'm so proud of you guys.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.278
We got this.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.346
I'm Neil.
I'm Gentry.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.547
And I'm Rob.

09:40.547 --> 09:45.552
♪ And we're The Joy Reunion

09:47.454 --> 09:50.023
Gentry and I,
we started playing together

09:50.023 --> 09:53.527
in church
about 22 years ago.

09:53.527 --> 09:56.129
13 years ago,
when we met Neil,

09:56.129 --> 10:00.467
and the force of his voice
and guitar playing met us...

10:00.467 --> 10:05.305
It was just this
magic that happened.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.709
The name "The Joy Reunion"
comes from the idea

10:08.709 --> 10:11.011
that we were reunited
with the joy

10:11.011 --> 10:12.513
of making music.

10:12.513 --> 10:14.781
Throughout our collective history

10:14.781 --> 10:18.051
of playing in other bands,
in our own bands,

10:18.051 --> 10:19.486
we strived to be
rock stars,

10:19.486 --> 10:22.756
and we got jaded by all
the rejection and the nos.

10:22.756 --> 10:25.759
I really felt
rejuvenated musically

10:25.759 --> 10:29.162
when the three of us
started singing together.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.197
Even though
we're not a part

10:30.197 --> 10:31.665
of the country scene
in Nashville,

10:31.665 --> 10:34.034
being local
in Southern California,

10:34.034 --> 10:37.371
we pride ourselves in calling
ourself California country,

10:37.371 --> 10:41.275
because California country
is a little more poppy.

10:41.275 --> 10:43.343
And so, we are
all about harmony.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.412
When the three of us
are singing together,

10:45.412 --> 10:47.447
there's so much passion
and energy.

10:47.447 --> 10:51.118
We're here to prove
that three voices
are better than one.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.654
I like to say that
we are a chosen family,

10:53.654 --> 10:57.291
and these guys are
extended uncles to my kids.

10:57.291 --> 10:59.159
I always say they're like
the Uncle Jesse

10:59.159 --> 11:00.394
and Uncle Joey.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.496
I'm Uncle Jesse.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.464
My kids are supportive
because they feel

11:04.464 --> 11:06.533
like they're on
this journey with us.

11:06.533 --> 11:09.703
Hi, guys. It's your favorite
kids in the whole wide world.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.406
Good luck, and don't forget,
I'm your manager.

11:12.406 --> 11:14.508
I honestly don't know how
you're doing this without me.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.277
Makena, you're a great manager.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.380
We're so blessed
to have you.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.516
We've all done
the opening‐act thing

11:22.516 --> 11:26.086
for big artists
and had the almost,

11:26.086 --> 11:30.123
but we've never achieved
the main dream.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.025
When we started
singing together,

11:32.025 --> 11:33.527
I was going through
a divorce.

11:33.527 --> 11:36.296
Neil's mom was
battling cancer,

11:36.296 --> 11:38.665
and I was going through
a rocky point in my marriage.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.167
Through that time...

11:40.167 --> 11:43.136
We did become
like family.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.705
We've all had a long,
hard road.

11:44.705 --> 11:47.274
I really feel like this is
one of the only things

11:47.274 --> 11:49.476
that could launch us,
that could get our music

11:49.476 --> 11:52.079
in front of so many faces
at one time.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.481
I don't think we've ever been
more ready.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.283
‐This is live!
‐This is live.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.784

11:57.784 --> 12:00.220

We are
The Joy Reunion.

14:00.274 --> 14:01.408
Joy!
Whoo!

14:01.408 --> 14:03.010
Don't we need that?
Amen.

14:03.010 --> 14:06.180
Our name comes from
just being reunited

14:06.180 --> 14:07.381
with the joy of music
again,

14:07.381 --> 14:09.516
because we've all done
our own things

14:09.516 --> 14:12.452
and we've been denied
so many times.
Yeah.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.655
And it ‐‐ it feels so good.

14:14.655 --> 14:15.656
Aww!
Thank you.

14:15.656 --> 14:17.124
That's beautiful.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.159
Oh, I'm a contagious
crier.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.360
Hello!

14:20.360 --> 14:22.162
‐Hi.
‐Hi, Blake.

14:22.162 --> 14:25.332
It means a lot to me
when I hit my button
for a country artist

14:25.332 --> 14:28.535
because I'm a coach for all
kinds of artists on this show,

14:28.535 --> 14:31.004
but when it comes
to country artists,

14:31.004 --> 14:33.740
these are who's gonna take
this thing long after me

14:33.740 --> 14:35.709
and keep it going,
keep it on the radio.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.645
Country music isn't just
a hobby for me.

14:38.645 --> 14:43.050
Country music is my life.
I live it and breathe it.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.352
Like Blake,
country music is my life.

14:48.422 --> 14:50.157
I can't believe we got John
to turn around.

14:50.157 --> 14:53.760
Don't you see it as a sign?
I'm honored to turn for you.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.530
You all were so fun
to listen to.

14:56.530 --> 14:58.532
I was thrilled
by your voices,

14:58.532 --> 15:01.134
by the joy you brought
to the stage.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.504
And I'm so happy you
all found each other

15:03.504 --> 15:05.339
and are gonna get to be seen
by millions of people

15:05.339 --> 15:06.540
around the country.

15:06.540 --> 15:08.408
‐Thank you so much.
‐Thank you.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.144
I always have at least one
country artist

15:11.144 --> 15:13.313
that I try to get as far into
the competition

15:13.313 --> 15:14.481
as I possibly can.

15:14.481 --> 15:17.451
And I think,
20 out of 20 times,

15:17.451 --> 15:20.787
I've pretty much been able
to get somebody in the finale.

15:20.787 --> 15:22.523
"I am amazing,"
is what he's saying.

15:22.523 --> 15:24.424
Yeah.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.393
There's one reason
why I didn't turn.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.028
I love the sound,
I love the vibe,

15:28.028 --> 15:30.731
but I turned for a group
called Girl Named Tom,

15:30.731 --> 15:33.300
and it would be unfair
to you and unfair to them

15:33.300 --> 15:35.769
if I had two groups kind of
on my team going at it.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.437
I'm so happy for y'all.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.273
You're going to succeed.
You're going to do well.

15:39.273 --> 15:41.141
I think you guys
are spectacular.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.378
You sound amazing together.
Your tones blend perfectly.

15:44.378 --> 15:47.481
And I'm excited to see
where you end up.

15:47.481 --> 15:50.317
The Joy Reunion...
Yes.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.287
...who do you pick
as your coach?

15:53.287 --> 15:54.321
Come on!

15:54.321 --> 15:56.490
Can we pick both?
Yeah.

15:56.490 --> 16:00.527

16:00.527 --> 16:02.529
Okay.
Who wants to say it?

16:02.529 --> 16:04.031
Pick John!

16:04.031 --> 16:06.166
Come to Team Legend.
Shock the world.

16:08.035 --> 16:11.038
Okay, we're ready.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.039
We're going with Blake.

16:12.039 --> 16:15.742
Yes!

16:15.742 --> 16:18.212
Ha, ha, ha!

16:18.212 --> 16:21.481
Surprise, surprise.
I am shocked!

16:21.481 --> 16:24.051
Congratulations, man.
You guys sound incredible.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.786
Thank you.
Thank you.

16:25.786 --> 16:29.122
The Joy Reunion, I was thrilled
they chose me as their coach.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.491
Come on, we gotta go to
my camera and brag a little bit.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.361
I love having a chance to work
with a country trio...

16:34.361 --> 16:37.130

16:37.130 --> 16:40.033
No more tears, no more tears.
No more, no more.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.536
...and score some songs that
have some cool harmony parts,

16:42.536 --> 16:45.272
because we don't get to do that
that often on this show.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.406
See you later.
See you around.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.407
All right.
Sounds good.

16:52.746 --> 16:54.181
Don't be all braggy.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.383
Everyone knew they were
gonna pick you.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.085
You can't brag
about that.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.320
Oh, yes, I can.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.422
I was like, "Country music
is also my life."

17:02.422 --> 17:04.291
Yeah.
It is. It is.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.426

Ha!

17:10.430 --> 17:12.132
I love The Joy Reunion,

17:12.132 --> 17:14.701
and I believe I can really coach
a country artist.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.236
I may have fudged the truth
a little bit

17:16.236 --> 17:18.338
about living
and breathing country music.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.408
I learned from the best.
Blake taught me how to lie.

strong, and I screwed up.

21:52.346 --> 21:53.680
And I'm sorry.
That's okay.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.616
You're such
a great singer.
Thank you.

21:55.616 --> 21:57.351
I think you sounded
the tiniest bit nervous,

21:57.351 --> 21:59.019
and I was waiting
for it to go away.

21:59.019 --> 22:00.521
But you're incredible.

22:00.521 --> 22:02.756
You have an amazing voice,
obviously,

22:02.756 --> 22:04.558
but I just
wanted more space.

22:04.558 --> 22:07.461
I wanted to just hear
your voice and its pureness

22:07.461 --> 22:10.030
just holding out
and sustaining some notes.
Yeah.

22:10.030 --> 22:13.300
And so I‐I was trying to
navigate through all those.
Right.

22:13.300 --> 22:15.536
Your runs were cool
and unexpected...
So good.

22:15.536 --> 22:18.272
...and well‐executed.
Thank you.

22:18.272 --> 22:21.041
But it all felt like it
might have been a mismatch.

22:21.041 --> 22:23.510
And so, I think you come back
and do a different song,

22:23.510 --> 22:25.345
and you will get some
chair turns, for sure.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.781
Okay. Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

22:27.781 --> 22:30.617
Thank you, Jasmine!
Thank you, Jasmine.

Wow.

25:10.444 --> 25:12.312
Oh, my God.
What?!

25:12.312 --> 25:14.515
I've been waiting
till I turned 13

25:14.515 --> 25:16.183
to be on this show,

25:16.183 --> 25:18.418
and I'm so, so honored
to be here.
Wow!

25:18.418 --> 25:21.288
Welcome to
"The Voice."

25:21.288 --> 25:23.524
Ever since I could speak,
I've been singing.

25:23.524 --> 25:26.293
I'm in choir and vocal lessons.

25:26.293 --> 25:28.428
I did talent shows
for my school.

25:28.428 --> 25:31.398
So, music has been there for me
throughout my life.

25:31.398 --> 25:34.401
It's really helped me
as an escape.

25:34.401 --> 25:38.405
I was born with an eye condition
called double elevator palsy.

25:38.405 --> 25:43.010
That basically means the brain
starts to register that eye

25:43.010 --> 25:44.444
as a non‐working eye.

25:44.444 --> 25:47.514
And slowly, the vision
just kind of starts going away.

25:47.514 --> 25:50.450
The doctor suggested surgery,
and it was very scary

25:50.450 --> 25:53.053
to have her go
under the knife at 7,

25:53.053 --> 25:55.222
but she healed
beautifully.

25:55.222 --> 25:57.090
The surgery,
it went super successful.

25:57.090 --> 25:58.625
I regained most
of my vision back.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.127
I'm so proud.

26:00.127 --> 26:01.528
You've made it
this far,

accomplishment.

26:18.378 --> 26:22.015
Seeing Carter Rubin win
was super inspirational for me,

26:22.015 --> 26:23.250

he was so young.

This is so unbelievably
amazing.

Yes.

26:32.059 --> 26:34.228
Wow!
Oh, she's beaming!

26:34.228 --> 26:35.462
I literally thought
I was turning around

26:35.462 --> 26:37.397

so I was like,

26:37.397 --> 26:39.633
"Why are we not turning around?
What's happening?"
Me, too.

26:39.633 --> 26:42.402
I have won the show
with a 14‐year‐old before,

26:42.402 --> 26:44.538
and to be this young

26:44.538 --> 26:47.140
and have that kind of gift,
job well done.

26:47.140 --> 26:48.509

the power to belt,

in the verse.

really kind of sing

Wow, I'm so excited
you're here.

27:07.427 --> 27:10.097

all the parts of it.

27:10.097 --> 27:11.532
And for you
to be able to do it

27:11.532 --> 27:13.200
was really,
really impressive.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.601

27:27.548 --> 27:30.150
I think you're
a phenomenal singer,

27:30.150 --> 27:32.119

that you were young,

27:32.119 --> 27:33.487
but I didn't
think this young.

27:33.487 --> 27:37.491
And I think that with more
singing on this show

27:37.491 --> 27:39.459
and being able
to work together,

27:39.459 --> 27:43.463
these moments are what's just
gonna keep helping you grow

27:43.463 --> 27:47.401
and have even more control
and even more understanding of

27:47.401 --> 27:49.536
when you want to make
your vibrato really wide

27:49.536 --> 27:51.505
and when you want to keep it
close and intimate.

27:51.505 --> 27:54.408
You're just gonna
continue to flourish,

27:54.408 --> 27:57.644

get there and be your coach.

a position here

to have ever won "The Voice."

on this show.

28:11.158 --> 28:14.528

you won this with Ariana.

talking about?

28:34.548 --> 28:37.251

I just want to tell you
that I don't have

28:37.251 --> 28:40.153
anyone on my team

28:40.153 --> 28:42.389

The fact that she handled
all this pressure

29:45.285 --> 29:48.455
at that age without any sort
of coaching just tells me

29:48.455 --> 29:52.392
that she's going to be able
to really go far in this.

‐All right, let's go.
‐Okay.

31:40.667 --> 31:41.635
Whoo!

31:41.635 --> 31:44.605
Come on, granddaughter.

31:44.605 --> 31:46.206
When I found out my dad

31:46.206 --> 31:48.141
was going to be in front
of Ariana Grande,

31:48.141 --> 31:49.676
even breathing
the same air as her,

31:49.676 --> 31:51.178
I was so mad at him.

31:51.178 --> 31:54.515
I didn't talk
to him for like a day.

31:54.515 --> 31:56.116
She was really upset.
She was saying,

31:56.116 --> 31:58.785
"How is this going to ‐‐
How can this be?"

31:58.785 --> 32:01.755
If she turns her chair
and you do not pick her,

32:01.755 --> 32:03.223
we will literally
not speak.

32:03.223 --> 32:04.691
My name is Jeremy Rosado,

32:04.691 --> 32:07.761
I'm 29 years old,
and I'm from Tampa, Florida.

32:07.761 --> 32:11.498
Jocelyn is my daughter
who is biologically my niece.

32:11.498 --> 32:15.202
When Jocelyn was 2 years old,
my sister lost custody of her.

32:15.202 --> 32:16.770
My sister wasn't able
to be the mom

32:16.770 --> 32:18.472
that she needed to be.

32:18.472 --> 32:22.209
That...was tough,

32:22.209 --> 32:25.546
and my mom gained custody.

32:25.546 --> 32:28.782
I was 13 at this point,
Jossy was 2.

32:28.782 --> 32:31.118
My life fast‐forwarded
really quick.

32:31.118 --> 32:34.454
I became kind of like
a man of the house

32:34.454 --> 32:37.591
and started to raise a kid.

32:37.591 --> 32:40.694
Potty trained her,
took her to school every day.

32:40.694 --> 32:42.763
And as I grew
and became an adult,

32:42.763 --> 32:45.666
I didn't want my mom
to have to raise a kid again.

32:45.666 --> 32:47.434
I felt like it was time
for me to step in

32:47.434 --> 32:51.104
and take that responsibility
off her shoulders.

32:51.104 --> 32:55.108
I was 22 when I officially
became Jossy's guardian.

32:55.108 --> 32:58.679
My music career
had to become backburner.

32:58.679 --> 33:02.049
He wanted me
to have a perfect life.

33:02.049 --> 33:04.518
He wanted me to feel loved.

33:04.518 --> 33:08.222
He's been the one person
that's stayed consistent.

33:08.222 --> 33:10.157
My kid, she's enrolled
in college now.

33:10.157 --> 33:13.594
Like...

33:13.594 --> 33:15.662
I'm just so proud.

33:20.667 --> 33:23.136
I missed my daughter's
graduation being here.

33:23.136 --> 33:26.373
She told me,
"You stopped your life for me.

33:26.373 --> 33:29.643
I'm not gonna let you give up
another opportunity for me."

33:29.643 --> 33:32.779
Everyone is going to see
what I see every day,

33:32.779 --> 33:37.150
and they're going to
fall in love with you.

33:37.150 --> 33:38.685
Thank you, baby.

33:40.621 --> 33:42.656
For the Blind Auditions,
I am singing

33:42.656 --> 33:45.626
"Here Comes Goodbye"
by Rascal Flatts.

33:45.626 --> 33:49.196
I'm not a country artist,
but I just love to take songs

33:49.196 --> 33:51.198
and just make it my own.

33:51.198 --> 33:54.168
This song, it really
is talking about seasons

33:54.168 --> 33:55.669
and people adjusting,

33:55.669 --> 33:57.771
and this is such
a transitional period

33:57.771 --> 33:59.740
for me and for my daughter.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.775
Ladies and gentlemen,
our next artist.

34:01.775 --> 34:03.010
I think it'll be a dude.

34:03.010 --> 34:05.112
Okay.

34:05.112 --> 34:06.380
Oh, my God!

34:07.681 --> 34:09.583
With her graduating
high school,

34:09.583 --> 34:13.720
it just feels like it's my time
to pursue this dream of mine.

34:13.720 --> 34:16.023

What?!

35:54.621 --> 35:57.024
Oh!

35:57.024 --> 35:58.625
Hi.
My name is Jeremy Rosado.

35:58.625 --> 36:01.161
I'm 29 years old,
from Tampa, Florida.

36:01.161 --> 36:03.564
Oh, man.

36:03.564 --> 36:05.632
That was, first of all,
incredibly cool,

36:05.632 --> 36:08.702
because I was like, okay, R&B,
singing this country song.

36:08.702 --> 36:10.537
That's actually what we do
on Team Kelly,

36:10.537 --> 36:12.673
because that's what
I love to do, personally.

36:12.673 --> 36:14.408
I don't have anybody ‐‐
Well, I'm gonna be honest ‐‐

36:14.408 --> 36:15.676
Nobody has anybody
like you on their team,

36:15.676 --> 36:17.544
and nobody sings like you.
Thank you so much.

36:17.544 --> 36:20.013
There were a couple parts
where I was like, "Hmm."

36:20.013 --> 36:23.550
But you're so overwhelmingly
talented as a vocalist,

36:23.550 --> 36:25.786
I would go for emotion
over pitch

36:25.786 --> 36:27.521
when it comes to
a vocalist like you.

36:27.521 --> 36:29.790
Thank you.
I would love to coach you.

36:29.790 --> 36:31.491
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

36:31.491 --> 36:33.727
Oh, and you would look
really cute...
Whoo!

36:33.727 --> 36:36.630
...in this turquoise number,
just saying.

36:36.630 --> 36:38.465
I love that turquoise.

36:38.465 --> 36:40.133
Hey, after
the battle rounds,

36:40.133 --> 36:41.768
the thrift store
down the street here

36:41.768 --> 36:43.103
will have plenty
of them for you.

36:43.103 --> 36:44.404
That is a lie.

36:46.139 --> 36:50.143
I didn't push because I was
slightly nervous about control,

36:50.143 --> 36:52.012
but then you got to that
high note and you nailed it.

36:52.012 --> 36:53.647
It was, like,
absolutely perfect.

36:53.647 --> 36:56.583
Ariana, my daughter
would be just ‐‐

36:56.583 --> 36:58.151
She would go crazy.
Oh, my gosh.

36:58.151 --> 37:00.220
I'm sure I'll meet her
somewhere along this way.

37:00.220 --> 37:03.023
Oh, my God!

37:03.023 --> 37:04.691
She's actually just graduated
high school,

37:04.691 --> 37:06.593
and I'm here, but...
Oh, my God.

37:06.593 --> 37:08.128
You look too young to have
a high school daughter.
Yeah.

37:08.128 --> 37:09.630
What? Yeah, I thought you
meant like a 3‐year‐old.

37:09.630 --> 37:11.164
I've had the greatest
responsibility of my life

37:11.164 --> 37:12.733
being able to raise her
the past seven years.

37:12.733 --> 37:14.434
She's biologically
my niece,

37:14.434 --> 37:15.702
but legally,
she's my daughter now,

37:15.702 --> 37:17.137
so it's just...
Oh!

37:17.137 --> 37:18.672
...the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

37:18.672 --> 37:21.542
I can't wait to, hopefully,
give her a hug.

37:21.542 --> 37:23.677
Hey, Ariana.

37:23.677 --> 37:25.546
What?
Good buddy?

37:28.182 --> 37:30.450
Don't you think I would be
a great coach for Jeremy?

37:30.450 --> 37:31.518
You know what?

37:31.518 --> 37:33.120
You want my real
my real opinion?

37:33.120 --> 37:35.656
Depends.

37:35.656 --> 37:37.758
Don't ask then.

37:37.758 --> 37:39.760
I ‐‐ Okay, I would like
your real opinion now.

37:41.562 --> 37:45.799
You have so many really special
parts of your voice,

37:45.799 --> 37:48.468
and I think that Kelly
would be able to help you.

37:48.468 --> 37:50.404
Oh, my gosh.
I think so, too.

37:50.404 --> 37:52.406
I haven't even
pitched myself yet.

37:52.406 --> 37:55.008
I do think that Kelly might be
the right fit in this case.

37:55.008 --> 37:56.476
I'm sorry.
I lost my ally.
Oh, my gosh.

37:56.476 --> 37:59.112
All this buttering up
you've been doing, Blake,

37:59.112 --> 38:01.014
and ‐‐ and it was for naught.
It's on now.

38:01.014 --> 38:02.115
It was for naught.

38:02.115 --> 38:04.184
It's on now.

38:04.184 --> 38:06.119
Oh, you were done already.
Anyway, go ahead
and pitch yourself, Blake.

38:06.119 --> 38:08.589
Is everybody in here
just obsessed with Ariana?

38:08.589 --> 38:10.524
There's other things,
too!

38:14.628 --> 38:18.498
Jeremy, you don't realize
the huge divide

38:18.498 --> 38:20.801
you just created right here
between these two,

38:20.801 --> 38:22.636
but that's not ‐‐
that's not your problem.

38:22.636 --> 38:24.505
Don't worry about it.
You created it.
You asked her.

38:24.505 --> 38:26.406
What I loved about
your performance

38:26.406 --> 38:29.409
is you wouldn't take no
for an answer.

38:29.409 --> 38:31.411
You just kept getting
better and better.

38:31.411 --> 38:33.247
That's the kind of artist
I want to work with,

38:33.247 --> 38:35.182
the ones
that continue to dig.

38:35.182 --> 38:37.117
And even in the moment
you did that,

38:37.117 --> 38:38.552
and that's impressive,
dude.

38:38.552 --> 38:39.686
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate that, Blake.

38:39.686 --> 38:41.154
Thank you.
Absolutely.

is how big your heart is,

38:44.491 --> 38:47.561

you through this competition.

38:47.561 --> 38:49.229

Thank you so much.

38:49.229 --> 38:51.231

It was waste.

39:50.524 --> 39:52.059
You put her on the spot.
And she spoke the truth!

39:52.059 --> 39:54.461
Because I thought
she was my friend!

just did that

39:58.131 --> 40:01.068

40:06.106 --> 40:08.141
Mm‐hmm.
I'll see how it is.

I know Blake is mad at me,
but I know he's not my ally.

40:11.111 --> 40:13.113

41:34.528 --> 41:36.096
Yeah, don't pay attention
to the snake in the grass.

41:36.096 --> 41:37.264
There will be no wooing.

41:37.264 --> 41:39.166
I am not wooable.
I am unwooable.

41:39.166 --> 41:41.268
You know that it was
like a two‐way street.

41:41.268 --> 41:42.736
Not anymore.
You know what?

41:42.736 --> 41:44.004
That says more about you
than us.

41:44.004 --> 41:45.072
I can live with that.

41:47.241 --> 41:49.142
I'm just really excited
to be here.

41:49.142 --> 41:51.044
This is a dream come true.

41:51.044 --> 41:53.247
I was born and raised
in Piney Flats, Tennessee.

41:53.247 --> 41:55.182
There's not much
fun things to do.

41:55.182 --> 41:57.217
We got a mall.
We're pretty fancy like that.

41:59.486 --> 42:02.322
They still call me Fiddle Boy.

42:02.322 --> 42:04.424
My name is Carson Peters,
I'm 17 years old,

42:04.424 --> 42:06.326
and I'm from Piney Flats,
Tennessee.

42:06.326 --> 42:07.528
I started playing the fiddle

42:07.528 --> 42:09.329
when I was 3 1/2 years old.

42:09.329 --> 42:12.232
It was a one‐eighth‐size fiddle,
so it was like this big,

42:12.232 --> 42:14.234
and I was about that big.

42:14.234 --> 42:16.203
Around seven or eight,

42:16.203 --> 42:18.138
I played "The Tonight Show
with Jay Leno."

42:18.138 --> 42:19.506
I remember my legs
were just shaking.

42:19.506 --> 42:22.242
I was scared to death,
but it opened some doors.

42:22.242 --> 42:24.778
A few years later,
I opened up for Ricky Skaggs.

42:24.778 --> 42:26.413
After the show,
he just asked me

42:26.413 --> 42:29.049
if I ever played the Opry,
and I was like, "No, I haven't."

42:29.049 --> 42:30.317
And he said, "Well,
we gotta change that."

42:30.317 --> 42:32.052
Fiddling Carson Peters.
Come on out, Carson.

42:32.052 --> 42:34.421
The next Saturday,
we were at the Opry.

42:34.421 --> 42:37.324
It's just hard to explain
how special that stage is.

42:37.324 --> 42:39.293
A standing ovation here
at the Grand Ole Opry.
Thank you.

42:39.293 --> 42:41.361
Now that's hard to get,
son.

42:41.361 --> 42:43.397
To watch my son,
who I love so much,

42:43.397 --> 42:46.166
standing in the circle
at the Grand Ole Opry playing,

42:46.166 --> 42:49.369
that's just a really
special memory for me.

42:49.369 --> 42:51.271
We talk about the fiddle
all the time,

42:51.271 --> 42:53.140
but Carson loves to sing.

42:53.140 --> 42:55.275
So I'm really,
really excited

42:55.275 --> 43:00.147
about the world to be able
to hear Carson Peter sing

43:00.147 --> 43:02.316
on the "Voice" stage.
Wow.

43:02.316 --> 43:05.752
I feel like it's kind of obvious
that I would go with Team Blake,

43:05.752 --> 43:07.454
but as a high‐school boy,

43:07.454 --> 43:10.490
I was genuinely excited when
I found out that Ariana Grande

43:10.490 --> 43:12.526
was gonna be one
of the coaches this year.

43:12.526 --> 43:15.796
She could definitely help me
learn how to grow into my voice

43:15.796 --> 43:19.433
because she's been
in the limelight for so long.

43:19.433 --> 43:22.769
Hey, Carson.
Man, this is a big deal.

43:22.769 --> 43:25.105
So proud of you.
You've got this.

43:25.105 --> 43:27.174
And we love you very,
very much.

43:27.174 --> 43:28.709
Oh, that's so cool.

43:28.709 --> 43:30.377
To have one of my heroes

43:30.377 --> 43:32.412
say something like that
before I go out and do this,

43:32.412 --> 43:34.481
that really helps
with my nerves.

43:34.481 --> 43:37.417
I feel really good
about who's coming next.

43:37.417 --> 43:39.786
Me, too. I feel like
I'm gonna win someone.

43:39.786 --> 43:42.456
People always see me as the kid
that plays the fiddle.

43:42.456 --> 43:46.059
So hopefully it'll be
the kid that sings.

43:46.059 --> 43:47.127

45:35.135 --> 45:36.403
Yeah!

45:39.439 --> 45:41.241
Welcome to "The Voice."

45:41.241 --> 45:44.011
What is your name,
and where are you from?

45:44.011 --> 45:46.046
I'm Carson Peters,
I'm 17 years old,

45:46.046 --> 45:47.681
and I'm from Piney Flats,
Tennessee.

45:47.681 --> 45:50.751
I heard a lot of Oklahoma
references in that song.

45:50.751 --> 45:52.519
Well, it's living on Tulsa time,
so that's why.

45:52.519 --> 45:54.354
Yeah, I now.

45:54.354 --> 45:57.090
And you might have
an interest

45:57.090 --> 45:59.393
in being with a coach
from that lovely state.

45:59.393 --> 46:01.061
Or the better one
below it.

46:02.529 --> 46:04.264
My name is John Legend.

46:04.264 --> 46:07.100
I turned for you before
any of these coaches did.

46:07.100 --> 46:08.335
That is a very good point.

46:08.335 --> 46:10.237
I love that lower part
of your voice

46:10.237 --> 46:12.306
in the beginning of the song,
but when you started to hit

46:12.306 --> 46:15.008
those big notes
with such confidence,

46:15.008 --> 46:17.044
it looked like you
just having fun up there.

46:17.044 --> 46:18.445
Do you perform a lot?

46:18.445 --> 46:20.714
I started out
playing the fiddle.
Oh, wow.

46:20.714 --> 46:23.283
That's very Tennessee of me.
My chances are
getting better and better,

46:23.283 --> 46:24.751
making more and more sense
for me.
Like blue ‐‐ Were you doing,
like, bluegrass, or...?

46:24.751 --> 46:25.752
Bluegrass, yes, ma'am.
Yeah.

46:25.752 --> 46:27.187
That's my main thing still.

46:27.187 --> 46:28.388
I love your voice.

46:28.388 --> 46:30.190
I think it's
authentically country.

46:30.190 --> 46:31.391
What are
your influences?

46:31.391 --> 46:33.227
One of my really
biggest influences,

46:33.227 --> 46:34.461
and I've been lucky enough
to play with him

46:34.461 --> 46:36.196
is Mr. Ricky Skaggs.
What? Oh.

46:36.196 --> 46:38.232
Uh‐huh. Amazing.
I hope you bring out
the fiddle

46:38.232 --> 46:39.800
when you're on my team.
I'd love to.

46:39.800 --> 46:42.369
I'm a very
fiddle‐friendly coach.

46:44.338 --> 46:46.773
And there's no one on my team
that sings country.

46:46.773 --> 46:48.141
And you know Blake already

46:48.141 --> 46:50.010
has some country singers
on his team.

46:50.010 --> 46:53.146
I want you to have
a clear, open lane.

46:53.146 --> 46:55.115
I took a country singer
to the lives.

46:55.115 --> 46:57.451
I took country singers
to ‐‐ to take trophies home.

46:57.451 --> 46:59.052
Just saying it.
I literally ‐‐

46:59.052 --> 47:03.257
And I literally
just won a CMT award,

47:03.257 --> 47:05.425
my very first award
with Carrie Underwood.

47:05.425 --> 47:09.129
That's a great song.
Video of the Year.

47:09.129 --> 47:12.399
We can do this together.
We can shock the world, Carson.

47:12.399 --> 47:15.269
The beating
I'm taking right now.

47:15.269 --> 47:17.771
I just appreciated
your talent so much.

47:17.771 --> 47:20.407
And I heard some runs in there
that really excited me,

47:20.407 --> 47:22.509
and the whole performance
was just so enjoyable.

47:22.509 --> 47:25.779
I have no one on my team
that is a country artist,

47:25.779 --> 47:28.348
but I am well aware that is not
what you're choosing.

47:28.348 --> 47:30.250
So I'm gonna just say,
you're amazing.

47:30.250 --> 47:32.319
Don't assume
he's gonna pick me, guys.

47:32.319 --> 47:33.720
This is embarrassing.
I mean,
I'm taking it for granted.

47:33.720 --> 47:35.455
We all know
you're going to John, so...

47:35.455 --> 47:37.791
Carson ‐‐ very impressed.

47:37.791 --> 47:40.093
You weren't very impressed.
It was the last one to turn.

47:40.093 --> 47:41.528
Was I the last one to turn?
You were the last one.

47:41.528 --> 47:42.529
Yeah.
Yeah.

47:42.529 --> 47:44.131
I might be wrong,

47:44.131 --> 47:45.299
but I think it was you
that was last.

47:45.299 --> 47:47.134
No.
Yeah, I think so.

47:48.502 --> 47:50.504
It was me. It was me.
Honestly, Carson.

47:50.504 --> 47:52.773
That's my man
right there!

47:52.773 --> 47:56.276
What I would caution you with,
with the other three,

47:56.276 --> 48:00.180
is you can say, "Man,
you're bluegrass and country.

48:00.180 --> 48:02.049
I like that, too."

48:02.049 --> 48:04.451
Or you can understand that
there's popular bluegrass music

48:04.451 --> 48:07.254
and then there's what you hear
on country radio.
For sure, yeah.

48:07.254 --> 48:09.790
I'm thinking if
Ricky Skaggs is your man,

48:09.790 --> 48:11.792
you want to rewind time
30 years back.
I want to bring it back
a little bit, yeah.

48:11.792 --> 48:14.795
There's a lot of ‐‐
lot of paths that you can take.

48:14.795 --> 48:16.230
What we got to figure out

48:16.230 --> 48:20.033
is which one best represents
who you are.

48:20.033 --> 48:25.005
Let's not mess around with what
this opportunity is for you.

48:25.005 --> 48:26.440
Oh, my gosh.
Let's do this right, Carson.

48:26.440 --> 48:29.309
Come on.
You got a decision
to make, Carson.

48:29.309 --> 48:31.011
And I'm so hopeful.

48:31.011 --> 48:32.446
Oh, my God,
that's a cute thing.

48:32.446 --> 48:34.047
It's so sweet.

48:34.047 --> 48:36.416
Carson,
Who do you pick as your coach?

48:36.416 --> 48:39.186
Come on, Carson.

48:39.186 --> 48:41.221
Let's do this, buddy!

48:41.221 --> 48:43.524
Come on, shock the world.

48:43.524 --> 48:46.360
Y'all made it a lot more tough
than I thought it was gonna be.

48:46.360 --> 48:48.061
Who do you think?
Blake.

48:48.061 --> 48:49.730
Blake?
Oh, make it turn.

48:49.730 --> 48:51.298
He may throw me a curve,
though.

48:51.298 --> 48:53.233
Never know.

48:53.233 --> 48:55.235
Come on, Carson.

48:55.235 --> 48:57.137
Come on.

48:57.137 --> 48:58.772
Just based on
the knowledge of the music...

48:58.772 --> 49:00.507
Oh, thank you.
...I got to go with Blake.

49:00.507 --> 49:04.011
Yes!

49:04.011 --> 49:06.280
Whoo! Carson!

49:06.280 --> 49:09.316
Carson's young, and you can
hear that in his voice,

49:09.316 --> 49:12.186
but you can also
hear a unique tone.

49:12.186 --> 49:15.789
Hats off to John,
Ariana, and even Kelly,

49:15.789 --> 49:18.458
but what's sad and funny

49:18.458 --> 49:21.028
is the fact that they thought
they had a chance

49:21.028 --> 49:23.463
to get him on their team.

49:23.463 --> 49:26.433
We're midway through the blinds,
and I'm feeling good right now.

49:26.433 --> 49:28.001
You really were great.

49:28.001 --> 49:29.136
I tried again
for a country artist.

49:29.136 --> 49:31.405
You see that, America?!
Four chairs!

49:31.405 --> 49:36.376
I'm always looking for something
diverse and eclectic and cool.

49:36.376 --> 49:38.512
Look over here.
Look at this guy coming in here.

49:38.512 --> 49:40.747
Look at this crybaby.
Hi.

49:40.747 --> 49:42.716
Uh, this is the ‐‐
this is the win camera.

49:42.716 --> 49:44.251
Not the loser camera.

49:44.251 --> 49:46.386
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.269
Wow.
Okay.

52:06.269 --> 52:09.239
Keilah, what a journey
you took us on vocally.

52:09.239 --> 52:10.941
Your voice
has a lot of energy.

52:10.941 --> 52:13.243
It just radiates
from the stage,

52:13.243 --> 52:15.746
and I would love to coach you.
I'd be so much fun.

52:15.746 --> 52:18.749
Tell us about your family.
Who's here with you?

52:18.749 --> 52:21.551
My dad is here.
He's standing over there.
Mm‐hmm. Hi, Dad.

52:21.551 --> 52:22.819
My dad's my best friend.

52:22.819 --> 52:26.623
Aww!
Are you so proud?

52:26.623 --> 52:28.258
So proud.

52:28.258 --> 52:29.793
Here you go, Mama.

52:29.793 --> 52:32.262
My whole house was just music
all the time.

52:32.262 --> 52:34.965
My family's kind of like
the modern‐day Partridge family.

52:34.965 --> 52:37.667
I remember when I was like
5 years old

52:37.667 --> 52:38.969
getting up on stage with them

52:38.969 --> 52:41.705
'cause they both led worship
at our church,

52:41.705 --> 52:43.573
playing around
during band rehearsal.

52:43.573 --> 52:46.009
I just grew up
in that environment.

52:46.009 --> 52:48.645
When I turned 8,
I started writing

52:48.645 --> 52:51.982
and I was learning guitar
and piano.

52:51.982 --> 52:55.619
After that,
I gigged at Hershey Park

52:55.619 --> 52:57.754
and at venues
in New York City,

52:57.754 --> 53:00.524
like the Bitter End,
St. George Theatre.

53:00.524 --> 53:02.859
It's crazy walking in there
and seeing all of the posters

53:02.859 --> 53:04.261
they have on the walls
of like people

53:04.261 --> 53:06.630
who have performed there,
like Lady Gaga.

53:06.630 --> 53:09.633
It's like, whoa,
this is, like, the real deal.

53:09.633 --> 53:10.967
I love you.

53:10.967 --> 53:12.769
My parents, they were
working in the church,

53:12.769 --> 53:15.272
but recently they've just
dropped everything

53:15.272 --> 53:16.907
to be my full‐time managers.

53:16.907 --> 53:19.910
I feel really blessed
I was born into a family

53:19.910 --> 53:23.246
that is so big
about following your passion.

53:23.246 --> 53:28.251
My mom came here from
the Philippines when she was 7.

53:28.251 --> 53:31.988
I feel like my mom
and my grandparents

53:31.988 --> 53:34.624
built themselves from the ground
up when they came here.

53:34.624 --> 53:36.526
Like, this is really big
for not just me,

53:36.526 --> 53:38.895
but for my whole family.

53:38.895 --> 53:41.598
It's out of this world
that I'm even here right now.

53:41.598 --> 53:43.900
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

53:43.900 --> 53:45.769
I love working with
artists like you

53:45.769 --> 53:49.573
that have so much potential
and so much opportunity to grow.

53:49.573 --> 53:52.676
It kind of reminded me like
Olivia Newton‐John kind of vibe.

53:52.676 --> 53:54.511
It was so piercing
and powerful.

53:54.511 --> 53:55.712
Yeah, you were darker than that.
That was cool.

53:55.712 --> 53:57.247
No one on my team
sounds like you.

53:57.247 --> 53:59.249
I would devote
a lot of energy

53:59.249 --> 54:01.885
to making sure you have
a special place

54:01.885 --> 54:04.488
to shine on this show.
Thank you so much.

54:05.722 --> 54:09.626
I turned light‐years
before them.

54:09.626 --> 54:10.861
I did notice.

54:10.861 --> 54:13.263
I was, like,
feeling it early on,

54:13.263 --> 54:16.767
and that's why I turned
my chair like so much faster

54:16.767 --> 54:17.968
than they did.

54:17.968 --> 54:21.605
And I love your voice.
It's super passionate.

54:21.605 --> 54:23.273
I love the little growl.
Thank you.

54:23.273 --> 54:25.008
It's like there's a little actor
in you as well,

54:25.008 --> 54:27.010
because you're this sweet
little thing right here.

54:27.010 --> 54:28.912
But I love it. You're like
a little rock star.

54:28.912 --> 54:31.848
I really felt moved by you
early on,

54:31.848 --> 54:33.750
like, way earlier
than them.

54:33.750 --> 54:35.519
Oh.

54:35.519 --> 54:38.889
That's so nice. Lovely.
Um, do you act as well?

54:38.889 --> 54:42.259
One of my, like, biggest goals
is to be on a TV show.

54:42.259 --> 54:43.894
It's fun to have
your own TV show.

54:43.894 --> 54:47.697
This is mine.
I‐I've had this one for years.

54:47.697 --> 54:50.267
So you should do it.

54:50.267 --> 54:54.738
You have such a great voice.
You have so much soul and depth.

54:54.738 --> 54:58.508
And I started trying
to actively pursue music

54:58.508 --> 54:59.876
when I was
around your age, too.

54:59.876 --> 55:01.878
So I feel like
having that in common,

55:01.878 --> 55:03.613
I might be helpful.

55:03.613 --> 55:05.649
You're incredible.

55:05.649 --> 55:07.751
And I would love
to work with you.

55:07.751 --> 55:10.887
Kelly and Ariana both have
multiple singers

55:10.887 --> 55:12.622
that are kind of
in your lane.
Mm.

55:12.622 --> 55:13.623
They have younger ‐‐
That's not true.

55:13.623 --> 55:14.791
I don't have anyone.

55:14.791 --> 55:16.526
I have no one
who sings like you.

55:16.526 --> 55:17.828
John's right about this.
I just feel like ‐‐

55:17.828 --> 55:19.262
That is not true!
Oh, my God.

55:19.262 --> 55:20.897
I just feel like,
on my team,

55:20.897 --> 55:22.933
you would have a lane
to yourself.
Yes.

55:22.933 --> 55:25.268
And I would give you
great advice.

55:25.268 --> 55:27.637
I have another young
girl, but she has a very
different voice than you.

55:27.637 --> 55:28.772
Oh, my God.

55:28.772 --> 55:30.774
And I think you have
a lane anyway

55:30.774 --> 55:33.977
because sonically,
you sing different.

55:33.977 --> 55:35.812
Did you have an idea of
who you were gonna pick

55:35.812 --> 55:38.982
before we started
spilling our guts?
Uh, kind of.

55:38.982 --> 55:41.585
Well, I'm sorry
I didn't hit my button.

55:41.585 --> 55:43.587
I know. I'm sorry.

55:43.587 --> 55:45.522
It's okay.

55:45.522 --> 55:48.625
Keilah, who do you pick
as your coach?

55:48.625 --> 55:49.993
Oh, man.

55:49.993 --> 55:51.962
Come on, Keilah!

55:59.770 --> 56:00.871

I really love all of you.
This is so hard.

56:10.747 --> 56:13.583
Who thought about it first?
Oh, Kelly did.

that I'm the last person

58:03.660 --> 58:05.629
that has a block left.

58:05.629 --> 58:07.397
I am Bubba.

58:07.397 --> 58:09.966
I'm 26 years old,
and I'm from Buffalo, New York.

58:09.966 --> 58:11.535
My real name is Ahmed.

58:11.535 --> 58:14.337
When I was younger,
my dad, who's from Yemen,

58:14.337 --> 58:15.639
called me Baba.

58:15.639 --> 58:17.541
That in the Arab culture
means father.

58:17.541 --> 58:20.310
Nice, little, cute nickname
fathers would say to their son.

58:20.310 --> 58:21.945
So my brother
overheard him say that

58:21.945 --> 58:23.480
and just, like, Bubba.

58:23.480 --> 58:26.450
That's the only name
I've always been called.

58:26.450 --> 58:28.985
Growing up gay
was troubling for me

58:28.985 --> 58:31.254
because I didn't understand
that I was,

58:31.254 --> 58:35.525
and so at age 15, when I came
out to my dad that I was gay,

58:35.525 --> 58:37.427
he told me,
"Don't worry about it.

58:37.427 --> 58:39.429
You're my son,
and you were born that way,

58:39.429 --> 58:41.398
and I love you no matter what."

58:41.398 --> 58:44.668
Just to hear him say those words
like that, despite our culture

58:44.668 --> 58:46.937
and the ideals
that were instilled to him,

58:46.937 --> 58:49.573
it really showed me
that he does care for me

58:49.573 --> 58:53.310
and it really, really
made me confident

58:53.310 --> 58:55.245
in other parts of my life.

58:55.245 --> 58:58.482
I started taking voice lessons,
going out and playing open mics,

58:58.482 --> 59:00.650
and learning how to sing
to people

59:00.650 --> 59:02.386
and, like, tell the story.

59:02.386 --> 59:04.488
"The Voice," to me,
is an opportunity to grow

59:04.488 --> 59:07.290
as an artist and just flourish.

59:09.493 --> 59:11.661
I am an at‐home hair stylist.

59:11.661 --> 59:13.663
I've been doing that
for eight years,

59:13.663 --> 59:16.967
and I do not want to do hair
for the rest of my life.

59:16.967 --> 59:20.537
I would love to be on a stage
for the rest of my life,

59:20.537 --> 59:22.339
just singing my heart out.

1:01:04.341 --> 1:01:05.942
My name is Bubba,
I'm 26 years old,

1:01:05.942 --> 1:01:07.010
and I'm from Buffalo, New York.

1:01:07.010 --> 1:01:08.645
Man,
I was so close, Bubba.

1:01:08.645 --> 1:01:11.648
There were moments when
you were just utterly brilliant.

1:01:11.648 --> 1:01:14.651
But there were also moments
where you were pitchy,

1:01:14.651 --> 1:01:17.487
and I heard a little bit
of voice cracking.

1:01:17.487 --> 1:01:20.524
So you just have to nail
hitting the notes

1:01:20.524 --> 1:01:22.392
so that we know we can go
to the next round with you

1:01:22.392 --> 1:01:23.660
and you'll do
the same thing.

1:01:23.660 --> 1:01:25.495
I really appreciate all that.
Mm‐hmm.

1:01:25.495 --> 1:01:27.764
I just sang every word with you.
Like, I love that song so much.

1:01:27.764 --> 1:01:30.534
You have a great idea of
what you should be singing
on a show like this.

1:01:30.534 --> 1:01:32.469
I just think you should
nail out the performance

1:01:32.469 --> 1:01:33.937
to where you're not
thinking about

1:01:33.937 --> 1:01:35.672
this is where I go here,
this is when I do this riff,

1:01:35.672 --> 1:01:37.674
this is when I ‐‐
just to where it feels like

1:01:37.674 --> 1:01:39.676
it becomes
like an extension of you,

1:01:39.676 --> 1:01:41.278
but you have
a very good voice.

1:01:41.278 --> 1:01:43.613
Thank you so much.

1:01:43.613 --> 1:01:46.516
I absolutely loved your tone,
but there were moments

1:01:46.516 --> 1:01:48.652
where I felt like
you were a little bit fatigued.

1:01:48.652 --> 1:01:50.387
Do it in a way
where you're not spending

1:01:50.387 --> 1:01:52.355
everything right
in the beginning.

1:01:52.355 --> 1:01:55.258
Then when you go for those high
notes, it'll still be there.

1:01:55.258 --> 1:01:56.660
Learning to spend it
wisely

1:01:56.660 --> 1:01:58.528
I think will be
really helpful to you,

1:01:58.528 --> 1:01:59.996
and you've got
a great gift

1:01:59.996 --> 1:02:02.399
and I can't wait to hear you
get more well‐oiled.

1:02:02.399 --> 1:02:04.568

magical person to come out.

He can sing.

1:02:22.219 --> 1:02:23.520

he can keep that tone,

1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:25.322
but, like, learn how
to do it differently.

1:02:25.322 --> 1:02:28.225

though.
For sure.

I didn't really think

1:03:55.278 --> 1:03:59.316
that I was capable of becoming
a popular singing artist.

1:03:59.316 --> 1:04:02.352

myself as much then as I do now.

1:04:04.221 --> 1:04:08.258
Absolutely.

I come from
a very musical family.

1:04:10.961 --> 1:04:15.365
Singing and music is definitely,
like, in the genes.

1:04:15.365 --> 1:04:18.802
But when I was young,
we weren't allowed to listen

1:04:18.802 --> 1:04:22.739
to any music outside
of Christian music.

1:04:22.739 --> 1:04:24.474

1:04:24.474 --> 1:04:27.978
all of these doors
and windows opened up.

1:04:27.978 --> 1:04:31.748
It was like a flooding
of all kinds of music for me.

1:04:31.748 --> 1:04:34.451
It changed my entire world.

1:04:34.451 --> 1:04:37.921

at live music clubs,

1:04:37.921 --> 1:04:39.356

1:04:39.356 --> 1:04:42.359
to perform
with a jazz trio in Russia.

1:04:42.359 --> 1:04:44.961
It was an incredible
culture shock.

1:04:44.961 --> 1:04:47.764
You know, New York City,
we got the "whoop‐whoops"

1:04:47.764 --> 1:04:48.965
and we got the cheers,

1:04:48.965 --> 1:04:51.268

is incredibly involved.

1:04:51.268 --> 1:04:53.470
Russia was very different
from that.

pan face,

soft clap after each song.

though, but...

1:11:49.753 --> 1:11:53.757
Nylon string, not using a pick,
and very formal.

1:11:55.325 --> 1:11:57.527
When I was younger, I didn't
really want to be a singer.

1:11:57.527 --> 1:11:59.896
And I think my identity
as a guitar player

1:11:59.896 --> 1:12:02.666
was a really big part
of my life.

1:12:02.666 --> 1:12:06.303
When I really started
to call myself a singer,

1:12:06.303 --> 1:12:08.305
I was playing in a garage band

1:12:08.305 --> 1:12:10.707
and we wanted to do
some performances that summer

1:12:10.707 --> 1:12:12.309
and we needed a singer.

1:12:12.309 --> 1:12:13.877
So they were like,
"Sing us a song,"

1:12:13.877 --> 1:12:17.481
and I sang them a song that
I'd been singing in my car.

1:12:17.481 --> 1:12:19.282
And they were like,
"That sounded great.

1:12:19.282 --> 1:12:21.485
Like, you should totally sing."

1:12:21.485 --> 1:12:25.889
My first real public performance
was when I was 18,

1:12:25.889 --> 1:12:28.658
and we performed
to a good little crowd

1:12:28.658 --> 1:12:30.761
of our close friends.

1:12:30.761 --> 1:12:33.764
I was more nervous than I have
ever been in my life.

1:12:33.764 --> 1:12:35.832
I was shaking.

1:12:35.832 --> 1:12:39.703
I realized that night
that I wanted to be on a stage

1:12:39.703 --> 1:12:42.472
and perform
for the rest of my life.

1:12:42.472 --> 1:12:43.874
For the past couple of years,

1:12:43.874 --> 1:12:47.711
I've performed outside
of the diner that I work at.

1:12:47.711 --> 1:12:50.414
Last year, I had the opportunity
to perform

1:12:50.414 --> 1:12:52.716
in front of James Taylor.

1:12:52.716 --> 1:12:55.752
I've listened to James Taylor
since I was a very young child,

1:12:55.752 --> 1:12:59.389
and for my blind audition, I'm
singing "Carolina in My Mind"

1:12:59.389 --> 1:13:02.392
by James Taylor,
which is very fitting.

1:13:02.392 --> 1:13:05.529
I really am new to singing,
and it's only been two years

1:13:05.529 --> 1:13:07.697
since I decided
to pursue it full time.

1:13:07.697 --> 1:13:10.667
And if I do get a chance
to be on a team,

1:13:10.667 --> 1:13:13.737
it would be a confirmation
that I made the right decision.

1:13:13.737 --> 1:13:15.439
Ready to go?
I'm ready to go.

1:13:15.439 --> 1:13:16.606
I've been waiting.
I'm ready.

1:13:16.606 --> 1:13:17.741
All right.
We're ready for you, man.

1:13:17.741 --> 1:13:19.309
Have a good performance.
Thank you.

1:14:42.492 --> 1:14:44.628
The thing why I didn't
return is, dynamically speaking,

1:14:44.628 --> 1:14:46.897
I was waiting for you to give me
a little bit more range.

1:14:46.897 --> 1:14:48.899
Yeah.
But I think you have
a really beautiful gift.

1:14:48.899 --> 1:14:50.600
Thank you.

1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:51.835
I loved your voice.
Thank you.

I think you have
a really special tone.

1:14:53.570 --> 1:14:55.439
I would listen
to an album of yours.

1:14:55.439 --> 1:14:57.441
The thing for me
was just, in this context,

1:14:57.441 --> 1:15:01.578
I wanted to see a little
bit more just to hit my button.

1:15:01.578 --> 1:15:03.747
Yeah.
But I think
you have a very special voice.

1:15:06.316 --> 1:15:10.854
I think for me, the pitch
issue was enough to dissuade me.

1:15:10.854 --> 1:15:16.426
But what you do have is this
really lovely, magical tone.

1:15:16.426 --> 1:15:19.496
It invites you in,
and if you came back

1:15:19.496 --> 1:15:21.331
and executed it
just a little better,

1:15:21.331 --> 1:15:22.632
I think you'd be
in a great spot.

1:15:22.632 --> 1:15:23.767
Thank you so much.

1:15:23.767 --> 1:15:25.435
Thank you, Lucas.
Thank you.

1:15:25.435 --> 1:15:27.337
Lucas came out

1:15:27.337 --> 1:15:30.340
and I felt like the whole
performance was a bit linear.

1:15:30.340 --> 1:15:32.709
And to be able to compete
in this environment,

1:15:32.709 --> 1:15:35.545
I need you to showcase
more dynamics.

1:15:35.545 --> 1:15:37.714
I'm waiting
for something special.

1:15:37.714 --> 1:15:39.883

it's about to come.

1:16:01.538 --> 1:16:05.308

that wrote my poems

1:16:10.680 --> 1:16:11.748
but I'm not
much of a singer.

1:16:11.748 --> 1:16:13.683
She filled that
puzzle piece for me.

1:16:13.683 --> 1:16:17.254
How could you not fall in love
with her voice? It's incredible.

1:16:50.654 --> 1:16:54.357
Around 11,
I started having seizures.

1:16:54.357 --> 1:16:55.759
The doctors put me on medication

1:16:55.759 --> 1:17:00.564
that made my hair
really brittle and patchy.

1:17:00.564 --> 1:17:03.633
I ended up losing my hair.

1:17:03.633 --> 1:17:07.337
For a kid,
it's not easy being bald.

1:17:08.739 --> 1:17:12.576
At that time, I would always
just listen to music on repeat

1:17:12.576 --> 1:17:14.344
in my room, singing,

1:17:14.344 --> 1:17:17.481

my confidence.

Well, I was the last person
to hit my button,

1:20:59.489 --> 1:21:02.259
and you're going to probably
hear about that from everybody.

1:21:02.259 --> 1:21:03.427
There's gonna be like,
"I hit it first!"

1:21:03.427 --> 1:21:04.928
Well, I hit it last.

1:21:04.928 --> 1:21:07.264
I definitely didn't hit mine
first, apparently.

1:21:07.264 --> 1:21:08.799
A millisecond.
You know,
I got to tell you

1:21:08.799 --> 1:21:11.168
what a great performance,
and my favorite part

1:21:11.168 --> 1:21:14.271
is when you hit these
little notes in the verses.

1:21:14.271 --> 1:21:15.772
That's what's impressive.

1:21:15.772 --> 1:21:18.241
And that's what makes you
not just a singer,

1:21:18.241 --> 1:21:19.676
that makes you
an artist and a person

1:21:19.676 --> 1:21:21.178
and someone that everybody
can relate to

1:21:21.178 --> 1:21:23.814

in that moment.
Thank you.

1:21:23.814 --> 1:21:27.751

1:21:42.799 --> 1:21:43.934

by a millisecond,

1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:51.375

1:22:10.661 --> 1:22:12.396

1:22:12.396 --> 1:22:15.232
from the opportunity
to pitch to you

1:22:15.232 --> 1:22:17.401
why I would love
to have you on Team Legend.

1:22:17.401 --> 1:22:23.240
I may have deserved it because
I used my block on Ariana,

1:22:23.240 --> 1:22:25.242
and she's been upset with me
for a while.

1:22:25.242 --> 1:22:27.210
She hasn't spoken to me
in the hallways or ‐‐

1:22:27.210 --> 1:22:28.845
That is not true!

1:22:28.845 --> 1:22:31.448
You're a liar
and a fraud!

1:22:31.448 --> 1:22:32.883
Giving me ‐‐
Giving me dirty looks.

1:22:32.883 --> 1:22:34.851
Very unbecoming.

1:22:34.851 --> 1:22:36.920
It's just been hard.
Honestly.
What?!

1:22:36.920 --> 1:22:39.256
What's going on?!

1:22:39.256 --> 1:22:41.258
I'm so proud of John
right now.

1:22:41.258 --> 1:22:42.693
I'm so proud of you,
man.

1:22:42.693 --> 1:22:45.162
You are looking at
three liars.

1:22:46.496 --> 1:22:49.299
She's been waiting
to exact revenge on me.

1:22:49.299 --> 1:22:50.701
That's true.

1:22:50.701 --> 1:22:52.903
So I just want
to congratulate you

1:22:52.903 --> 1:22:55.238
on giving such
a compelling performance

1:22:55.238 --> 1:22:58.275
that made all of us
so excited to turn around

1:22:58.275 --> 1:23:00.844
and see who is
the amazing person

1:23:00.844 --> 1:23:02.646
behind this amazing voice.
Thank you.

1:23:02.646 --> 1:23:04.815
I'm so sad I won't get
the chance to coach you.

1:23:04.815 --> 1:23:07.351
This might be a dream.
I don't know. But

1:23:07.351 --> 1:23:08.919
She's great.

1:23:08.919 --> 1:23:12.789
I‐I get it,
but I'm great, too.

1:23:12.789 --> 1:23:14.257
I know.

1:23:15.726 --> 1:23:17.394
It's true.
It's very true.

1:23:17.394 --> 1:23:19.262
I've won this show
a few times.

1:23:19.262 --> 1:23:21.231
I've won a show
on my own,

1:23:21.231 --> 1:23:23.233
and I love your voice
from the beginning,

1:23:23.233 --> 1:23:24.801
especially when you did the growl,

1:23:24.801 --> 1:23:26.436
the raspy,
like, soulful thing.

1:23:26.436 --> 1:23:27.904
You just got lost in it

1:23:27.904 --> 1:23:29.806
and you became just
the vessel for the song.

1:23:29.806 --> 1:23:31.908
And that's, like,
the most beautiful thing.

1:23:31.908 --> 1:23:33.844
And I know that
there's maybe a slim chance

1:23:33.844 --> 1:23:35.679
'cause if my baby girl
liked her,

1:23:35.679 --> 1:23:36.880
I'd probably go
with her, too,

1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:38.682
'cause I do everything
my daughter loves.

1:23:38.682 --> 1:23:41.785
But, Violet...

1:23:41.785 --> 1:23:43.387
I'm really cool, too.

1:23:44.821 --> 1:23:46.289
The cowboy
would like to speak.

1:23:46.289 --> 1:23:47.858
Can I just
say something here?
Yes.

1:23:47.858 --> 1:23:51.294
In reference
to your, I'm certain,

1:23:51.294 --> 1:23:55.799
beautiful daughter
that loves Ariana,

1:23:55.799 --> 1:24:02.239
I'll just remind you that some
children love too much sugar,

1:24:02.239 --> 1:24:05.776
or some kids may like
playing with fire.

1:24:05.776 --> 1:24:09.413
You know, it's not necessarily
the best thing.
True. Right.

1:24:09.413 --> 1:24:10.714
You see what
I'm saying?

1:24:10.714 --> 1:24:12.416
That's a great argument,
honestly.

1:24:12.416 --> 1:24:14.885
That could be bad,
okay?

1:24:14.885 --> 1:24:16.253
Are you done?
That's all I got.

1:24:16.253 --> 1:24:19.489
Well, anyway...
It's all we have.

1:24:19.489 --> 1:24:22.159
Well, Holly,
congratulations.
Thank you.

1:24:22.159 --> 1:24:24.261
We don't have a lot of
four‐chair turns on this show.

1:24:24.261 --> 1:24:26.263
It's a special club
to be in.

1:24:26.263 --> 1:24:28.231
Who do you pick
as your coach?

1:24:28.231 --> 1:24:30.400
Ooh.

1:24:31.835 --> 1:24:32.903
Um...

1:24:40.243 --> 1:24:41.378
I...
