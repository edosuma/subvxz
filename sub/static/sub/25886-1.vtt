[siren wailing]
[helicopter blades whirring]

00:05.500 --> 00:08.166
<i>[police radio chatter]</i>

00:15.583 --> 00:19.166
To the individual known
as Ghost Spider,
we've got you surrounded.

00:19.166 --> 00:22.208
Come out peacefully
with your hands up,
and you will not be harmed.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.834
Come out peacefully with--
[gasps]

00:31.125 --> 00:33.125
[grunts, groans]

00:33.125 --> 00:34.625

00:39.750 --> 00:40.750
[grunts]

00:42.792 --> 00:44.792
[muffled grunting]
Ugh!

00:44.792 --> 00:47.000
<i>[woman on police radio]</i>
<i>Officers down. Send backup.</i>

00:47.000 --> 00:49.792
<i>I repeat: officers down.</i>
<i>Send backup.</i>

00:49.792 --> 00:51.792
Won't do you any good.

00:54.834 --> 00:56.250
[grunts]

00:57.709 --> 00:59.959
Next time, come prepared.

01:04.625 --> 01:08.208
I'd like to pretend
that this was just
an incompetent rookie's mistake,

01:08.208 --> 01:10.917
but Stern is one of
my best officers.

01:10.917 --> 01:15.250
It's time to admit that the NYPD
isn't gonna bring in
the Ghost Spider.

01:15.250 --> 01:18.667
And that's why
I've come to you,
Agent Johnson, Agent Lucas.

01:18.667 --> 01:21.250
"Patriot" is fine.
And we specialize

01:21.250 --> 01:23.458
in dealing with
enhanced individuals.

01:23.458 --> 01:27.667
Cute name for it.
"Super-villain"
always worked for me.

01:27.667 --> 01:29.250
Especially for this one.

01:29.250 --> 01:32.083
Capturing the Ghost Spider
is my number one priority,

01:32.083 --> 01:34.333
even if it's not me
that brings her in.

01:34.333 --> 01:37.291
Don't worry, Captain Stacy.
S.H.I.E.L.D. is always
happy to help.

01:37.291 --> 01:41.250
Vigilantes who go bad
are far more dangerous
than ordinary criminals

01:41.250 --> 01:43.083
because of what
they can inspire.

01:43.083 --> 01:45.917
Ghost Spider
was supposedly a hero

01:45.917 --> 01:48.125
until she took
an innocent kid's life.

01:48.125 --> 01:50.125
I won't have
other vigilantes thinking

01:50.125 --> 01:53.500
they can end things their way
without consequences.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.166
She was responsible
for someone's death?

01:56.166 --> 01:58.000
My little girl's best friend,
actually.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.750
Kevin deserves justice,
Agent Johnson.

02:00.750 --> 02:03.000
Please, call me Daisy.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.792
Patriot and I are committed
to this case, Captain Stacy.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.000
We will bring her in.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.792
But have you ever considered
that she might not
be working alone?

02:11.792 --> 02:14.208
Ghost Spider's strictly solo.
Why?

02:14.208 --> 02:17.750
Because after she
breaks through this window,
just for a second,

02:17.750 --> 02:20.208
it gets darker inside.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.333
Must be a trick of the light.

02:22.333 --> 02:26.333
We searched that building
top to bottom.
No one was there.

02:26.333 --> 02:29.500
Then she'll be easier to catch.
No, there's nothing
easy about it.

02:29.500 --> 02:32.792
Our analysts say
Ghost Spider is a pro,

02:32.792 --> 02:35.083
likely military background.

02:35.083 --> 02:38.041
And I hope Captain America
trained you very well,

02:38.041 --> 02:40.875
because you're about to hunt
one of the most cunning,

02:40.875 --> 02:43.792
elusive villains
to ever plague this city.

02:43.792 --> 02:48.333
[snoring]
[cymbals crashing softly]

02:49.250 --> 02:51.667
Wha-- Oh, webs!

02:51.667 --> 02:53.208
Band practice!
[girl laughs]

02:53.208 --> 02:54.250
That was so funny.
[gasps]
Oh!

02:54.250 --> 02:55.583
[girl #2] Yeah,
whatever, guys.

02:55.583 --> 02:57.583
[chuckling]

02:57.583 --> 02:59.333
Gwen? You in here?

03:00.333 --> 03:02.333
Hey, Gloria. Present.

03:02.333 --> 03:04.333
What happened to you?

03:04.333 --> 03:07.500
I was chased by a SWAT team
for six city blocks. Duh.

03:09.417 --> 03:11.834
[laughing]

03:14.041 --> 03:18.417
Gwen, just admit you ate
too many pizza rolls
and passed out.

03:19.709 --> 03:21.417
Now let's jam!
