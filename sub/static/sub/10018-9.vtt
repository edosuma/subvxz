WEBVTT

00:06.982 --> 00:08.385
Previously on E.R.

00:08.386 --> 00:09.486
I figured I could
save you some money on roofing.

00:10.196 --> 00:13.305
- What are you doing up there?
- I'm destroying your roof.

00:13.406 --> 00:14.494
Do you want to have dinner?

00:14.595 --> 00:16.187
- Third-year resident?
- Yes.

00:16.187 --> 00:19.323
You better push those limits if you want
to remain invested in Surgery.

00:19.424 --> 00:22.556
I can't keep covering nights for you.
I did four last week.

00:22.557 --> 00:25.768
Yeah, you're right. You've been great.
I appreciate it. I'll figure something out.

00:25.769 --> 00:27.032
- Phone for you.
- Who is it?

00:27.033 --> 00:28.033
Your father.

00:28.234 --> 00:33.464
I haven't heard that voice in 22 years.

00:33.665 --> 00:37.061
It's been a great few days.
I kind of wish it wasn't gonna end.

00:38.116 --> 00:40.888
"Home"

00:44.803 --> 00:46.048
Doug?

00:47.389 --> 00:49.511
- Doug?
- He's not here.

00:50.141 --> 00:53.722
- I need you to take a look at little Susie.
- I'm not on yet, am I?

00:53.893 --> 00:56.051
You're a pediatrician.
You're always on.

00:56.229 --> 00:59.229
Yes, but I'm not your pediatrician.

01:00.482 --> 01:01.811
What time is it?

01:03.902 --> 01:06.605
Six a. m. She was up
half the night coughing.

01:06.779 --> 01:08.189
All right.

01:08.363 --> 01:10.439
Hey there, little one.

01:10.615 --> 01:12.026
What's going on?

01:12.200 --> 01:16.328
Let's see. She's pretty agreeable.

01:16.495 --> 01:20.539
That's because I kept her company
for the last five hours.

01:20.915 --> 01:22.160
What's the matter?

01:22.333 --> 01:25.250
I got elbowed in the
Mommy and Me class yesterday.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.910
- Sounds vicious.
- Oh, yeah. It was.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.337
I had the blue end of the parachute,
and little Susie was underneath...

01:31.507 --> 01:34.377
...and this yuppie mother came by
and yanked it and shoved me!

01:34.551 --> 01:36.876
I'm telling you,
this mother thing is not easy.

01:37.262 --> 01:39.053
You wouldn't know it by her.

01:39.222 --> 01:41.048
No temperature.

01:41.223 --> 01:44.010
Lungs are clear.

01:46.352 --> 01:47.846
No sore throat.

01:48.020 --> 01:51.270
This is the healthiest, happiest baby
that I have ever seen.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.013
Oh, God, I'm never gonna make
Gymboree tonight.

01:54.192 --> 01:59.777
Doug, paramedics are at the
back door with an infant, unresponsive.

01:59.946 --> 02:02.271
- You need a hand?
- Always.

02:02.448 --> 02:04.856
- Bye-bye. Can you hold her for a sec?
- Sure.

02:05.034 --> 02:07.785
Hey, little Susie.

02:09.037 --> 02:10.827
- What do you got?
- Two-month-old male...

02:10.996 --> 02:12.823
...unconscious and cyanotic
in his crib.

02:12.998 --> 02:15.703
- What is it? What's wrong?
- He was fine last night.

02:15.876 --> 02:19.493
Unresponsive at scene. Gave him two
rounds of epi and atropine in the field.

02:19.671 --> 02:22.375
- Got nothing.
- He just had a little bit of a cold.

02:22.548 --> 02:24.836
I just took him to
a pediatrician yesterday.

02:25.008 --> 02:28.423
Tube him. Number four uncuffed.
Hook up a compression, will you?

02:28.594 --> 02:31.630
- Number one, straight laryngoscope.
- I need tape on the tube.

02:31.805 --> 02:33.383
Here you go.

02:33.557 --> 02:35.383
- Temperature?
- It's 93.

02:35.559 --> 02:37.846
It wasn't a bad cold, not even a fever.

02:38.018 --> 02:39.298
Deep tendon reflexes absent.

02:39.478 --> 02:41.849
He's unresponsive to pain.
Try a high-dose epi.

02:42.022 --> 02:43.729
- What's he weigh? Ten pounds?
- Twelve.

02:43.898 --> 02:45.273
- Asystole.
- Point five.

02:45.441 --> 02:47.766
- Did our doctor miss something?
- What's your name?

02:47.943 --> 02:50.978
- Kenway.
- Okay, we need you to wait outside.

02:51.154 --> 02:52.398
What's wrong with him?

02:52.571 --> 02:54.896
Haleh...

02:55.074 --> 02:59.616
- We need to let the doctors work.
- I want to stay with my baby, please.

03:00.620 --> 03:04.747
- That's okay. I'll get that.
- Anterior fontanel is flat.

03:06.249 --> 03:09.618
- Anything on the monitor yet?
- No petechiae or ecchymosis.

03:09.794 --> 03:12.249
- Another dose of epi?
- What's his down time?

03:12.421 --> 03:14.212
- Forty-five minutes.
- Any pulse?

03:14.381 --> 03:15.959
- No.
- Pupils fixed and dilated.

03:16.341 --> 03:18.878
No rhythm. I'm gonna shock him.

03:19.051 --> 03:20.628
Charging.

03:23.221 --> 03:25.260
Susan...

03:25.723 --> 03:27.004
Susan, it's over.

03:27.183 --> 03:28.511
Susan, it's over.

03:30.018 --> 03:31.595
It's over.

03:32.687 --> 03:34.726
I'll mark the chart.

03:38.525 --> 03:41.810
- SIDS.
- Lydia, take him off the monitor.

03:41.987 --> 03:44.144
I'll get his parents back in here.

03:46.156 --> 03:47.436
Will you stay with him?

03:49.000 --> 03:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:21.392 --> 04:23.183
You gotta look at that face.

04:23.352 --> 04:27.100
She was fast asleep. Weren't you?

04:27.272 --> 04:29.810
- Thank you, Conni.
- You're welcome. Here you go.

04:35.488 --> 04:39.650
Yeah. What?

04:41.409 --> 04:44.742
Yeah. You're my little girl.

04:45.537 --> 04:47.197
My little girl.

04:48.748 --> 04:49.992
Yeah.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.993
I love you.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.291
Yeah, I love you.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.210
Yeah, I love you.

05:02.383 --> 05:03.628
Yeah.

05:58.804 --> 06:00.262
- Hi!
- Hi.

06:00.430 --> 06:03.347
- You look awful.
- Post-op. Two hours' sleep.

06:03.516 --> 06:06.719
- How does tonight look?
- Good, if Benton ever lets me out.

06:06.894 --> 06:10.143
- It's been, like, two days.
- It's been, like, over two days.

06:10.313 --> 06:12.850
I have a couple of hours tonight
between 6 and 8.

06:13.023 --> 06:14.601
Your place?

06:14.775 --> 06:16.933
- Dr. Wolverton.
- Hi.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.809
- Come with me.
- Where?

06:18.987 --> 06:20.564
This way.

06:31.539 --> 06:33.946
Hold the elevator.

06:34.582 --> 06:36.455
Where are the films
on the Spencer kid?

06:36.625 --> 06:40.325
- Radiology's backed up.
- Damn. Four West again.

06:40.504 --> 06:43.457
- Gabriel's calcium back yet?
- Normal. It's on his chart.

06:43.631 --> 06:46.881
Neuro's consulting on Weingast.
The films are...?

06:47.051 --> 06:50.584
- Yeah, in the reading room.
- Next time leave it bedside.

06:50.762 --> 06:52.386
This way.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.842
Haleh, sorry.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.518
- Hey, I could use some help here.
- Now?

07:01.687 --> 07:04.522
- No, next Labor Day.
- We'll send somebody.

07:05.899 --> 07:07.393
- We'll clean it up.
- Later.

07:07.567 --> 07:10.272
- When we get back from...
- Radiology.

07:16.449 --> 07:17.907
Conni?

07:18.075 --> 07:21.574
Oh, hi. Dropped the lateral decubitus.
Could you hand me those charts?

07:21.745 --> 07:24.200
- We came looking for the films on...
- Smith, John.

07:24.372 --> 07:27.455
- They don't appear to be here, so...
- We'll be back.

07:28.208 --> 07:30.201
Close call.

07:30.377 --> 07:32.702
- Could you give me a hand?
- Sure.

07:32.879 --> 07:34.622
No problem.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.252
- Right here okay?
- Great.

07:39.426 --> 07:40.836
- You want a bite?
- No.

07:41.010 --> 07:42.718
Oh, God, I do. I missed breakfast.

07:42.887 --> 07:46.338
- What's in the boxes?
- Something for me?

07:46.515 --> 07:48.306
It's for the children's
Christmas drive.

07:48.475 --> 07:51.559
Oh, yeah, there's gonna be one
lucky 4-year-old who gets this.

07:51.728 --> 07:55.226
- I haven't sorted through it yet.
- Is it secret Santa time already?

07:55.397 --> 07:58.314
Almost. And I arranged for you
to get me, so make it good.

07:59.817 --> 08:01.311
My mom sold the house.

08:01.485 --> 08:03.442
- Helen's moving?
- Yeah, to the 'burbs.

08:03.612 --> 08:06.185
She's been storing this stuff
in her basement for years.

08:06.365 --> 08:10.574
Now Carol is pawning it off on some
unsuspecting 4-year-old.

08:10.742 --> 08:15.451
- No, I'm gonna toss half of it.
- You never throw away this stuff.

08:15.622 --> 08:18.408
- My mom's a saver, not me.
- KC and the Sunshine Band?

08:18.666 --> 08:21.238
Yeah, you could toss that.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.910
- Whoa, this...
- Come on, now.

08:24.086 --> 08:29.293
- You never twirled a baton.
- No, I did. I did. I did.

08:31.051 --> 08:33.719
Something like this.

08:35.721 --> 08:38.804
Okay. Scalp lac in 3.

08:38.972 --> 08:41.049
- Anyone seen Carter?
- No.

08:57.155 --> 08:58.815
What is it?

08:58.990 --> 09:01.740
You're not a Catholic, are you?

09:01.908 --> 09:03.984
- Said good-bye to the old homestead?
- Yep.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.318
- Must be hard.
- No, not really.

09:06.495 --> 09:08.155
When my folks sold their place...

09:08.330 --> 09:11.829
...I went back there, and I carved
my name into every closet.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.498
- It's just a house.
- It's a home, Hathaway!

09:15.669 --> 09:19.168
It's got little height measurements
on the kitchen door.

09:19.339 --> 09:22.790
It's got a banister where I fell
and broke my collarbone.

09:22.967 --> 09:26.666
It's got this cool crawl space where my
brothers and I used to hide our Playboys.

09:26.845 --> 09:30.178
- Playboys?
- Yeah, when we were kids.

09:31.640 --> 09:35.341
- So no ID on this patient?
- Nope, nothing.

09:35.519 --> 09:38.519
We found him at the Goodman.
He's been sitting there for a while.

09:38.688 --> 09:42.103
Shepard, you gotta move your rig.

09:46.277 --> 09:49.444
- I need someone to cover a shift.
- Not tonight. I'm sorry.

09:49.613 --> 09:52.779
- Bet she'd take a rain check.
- Sorry, it's something I can't move.

09:52.949 --> 09:54.443
Hit-and-run's here.

09:54.617 --> 09:57.024
- You need a hand?
- Yeah.

09:57.661 --> 10:00.615
- What's open?
- Trauma 1.

10:01.498 --> 10:03.371
- Doris...?
-35-year-old male.

10:03.541 --> 10:06.541
Auto versus pedestrian.

10:06.710 --> 10:10.292
Pulse tachy at 120.
Possible mandible fracture.

10:10.463 --> 10:13.380
Five hundred cc bolus normal saline.

10:13.549 --> 10:16.633
O-210 liters,
and hare traction on the left leg.

10:16.802 --> 10:18.260
On my count...

10:18.428 --> 10:20.669
...one, two, three.

10:20.846 --> 10:22.922
Back to the slopes. See you.

10:23.098 --> 10:24.806
- What's his name?
- Ethan Brown.

10:24.975 --> 10:27.726
Mr. Brown, you're in the ER.
You were hit by a car.

10:27.894 --> 10:30.645
Need a cross-table C-spine.
Here you go. Chest.

10:30.813 --> 10:35.141
Pelvis, left femur, mandible.
CBC, type and cross four units...

10:35.316 --> 10:37.143
- ... Chem-7.
- My wife!

10:37.318 --> 10:40.651
Don't talk. Your jaw might be broken.
We'll contact your wife.

10:40.821 --> 10:42.315
I'll get a Foley in.

10:42.489 --> 10:44.481
Pressure's good, 125/80.

10:44.658 --> 10:46.649
Midshaft fractured femur.

10:46.825 --> 10:49.316
- Good distal pulses.
- Abdomen's benign.

10:49.494 --> 10:54.488

And let's watch his pressure.

10:54.665 --> 10:56.741
- What happened?
- Someone ran him down.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.992
Interviewing witnesses now.

10:59.168 --> 11:01.741
TMs are clear, no Battles Sign.

11:01.921 --> 11:03.249
Clear CT.

11:03.422 --> 11:06.838
No, no, no, Mr. Brown.
Mr. Brown, leave the mask on.

11:07.008 --> 11:08.668
Okay, calm down, calm down.

11:08.843 --> 11:11.464
Hi. I'm Carol.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.095
What's your name?

11:13.263 --> 11:14.840
Why do you ask that?

11:15.014 --> 11:16.259
Just curious.

11:16.432 --> 11:18.140
Mr. Sullivan.

11:18.309 --> 11:20.515
Can't smoke in here, Mr. Sullivan.

11:20.686 --> 11:21.931
Suture kit.

11:22.104 --> 11:24.891
Thanks. Can you hang out?
I'm not sure he's gonna need any.

11:25.064 --> 11:26.855
Can you hand me that saline?

11:27.024 --> 11:30.227
May I borrow a pencil, please?

11:32.070 --> 11:34.905
Why is your arm bleeding,
Mr. Sullivan?

11:35.073 --> 11:39.484
I work for the committee.
I'm an architect. This is a pen.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.488
Here you go. How's this?

11:44.663 --> 11:46.739
Is there someone we can call
to take you home?

11:46.915 --> 11:50.450
Why do you ask?
I mean, I know where it is.

11:51.627 --> 11:56.787
He's not gonna need any stitches,
but call Psych and Social Services.

11:56.965 --> 11:59.502
- Get Matthews.
- He's got the interview.

11:59.676 --> 12:02.297
- Well, then get Jones to do it.
- They all got interviews.

12:02.470 --> 12:04.379
Vucelich is never
gonna pick a third-year.

12:04.555 --> 12:06.842
You ought to apply.
It'd be great for your career.

12:07.014 --> 12:09.220
And yours.
You have a hematoma on your neck.

12:09.391 --> 12:11.964
- What do we have?
- Hit-and-run, moderate velocity.

12:12.144 --> 12:15.263
Left femur fracture, head trauma.

12:15.438 --> 12:17.395
- What is he on?
- Droperidol for agitation.

12:17.565 --> 12:21.478
- We couldn't control him.
- Got Mr. Brown's films.

12:21.735 --> 12:25.068
There's a shadow in the right base.
Carter, hemothorax.

12:25.238 --> 12:27.907
- Pulse up 120.
- I'll set up a Thora-Seal.

12:28.073 --> 12:29.900
Sats falling.

12:30.075 --> 12:33.028
- Number 32 French.
- I know.

12:36.663 --> 12:38.490

12:40.417 --> 12:42.325
- I'm in!
- Anyone call CT?

12:42.502 --> 12:45.038
Yeah. They're ready for him.

12:45.545 --> 12:47.205
Suction.

12:47.839 --> 12:49.582
It's draining.

12:49.757 --> 12:51.749
His real name is Joshua Shem.

12:51.926 --> 12:54.416
A diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic.

12:54.595 --> 12:57.132
Ran away from his residential home.

12:59.223 --> 13:01.215
They faxed us this.

13:01.391 --> 13:04.060
Prolixin, Thorazine, Trilafon,
even Clozaril.

13:04.227 --> 13:05.425
Won't stay on any of them.

13:05.603 --> 13:08.390
- It's the third time he ran away?
- They won't take him back.

13:08.564 --> 13:10.438
Three strikes and you're out.
Any family?

13:10.607 --> 13:13.441
- I'm still trying to track his mother down.
- Okay, thanks.

13:13.609 --> 13:16.100
Randi, could you find me the number
to Campanelli's?

13:16.278 --> 13:18.105
You don't wanna go there,
Dr. Ross.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.774
Excuse me?

13:19.948 --> 13:22.355
Drafty, stuffy,
and the pasta is kind of iffy.

13:22.534 --> 13:25.202
- Anyone we know?
- What's this?

13:25.368 --> 13:28.037
- You said you couldn't work tonight.
- Personal obligation.

13:28.204 --> 13:31.371
We got failure to fly in 3.
A kid fell off his bunk bed.

13:31.541 --> 13:33.747
- You care to join me?
- Okay.

13:35.919 --> 13:37.578
Ethan! Oh, my God!

13:37.753 --> 13:39.082
Is he hurt? Is he gonna die?

13:39.255 --> 13:42.041
No, he's not gonna die,
but you can't...

13:42.216 --> 13:44.042
- You can't go with him!
- I'm his wife.

13:44.217 --> 13:46.790
Mrs. Brown, your husband has been
in a serious accident.

13:46.970 --> 13:48.927
We're taking him up for a head CT...

13:49.097 --> 13:52.796
...but his injuries do not appear
to be life-threatening.

13:52.974 --> 13:55.132
- Then he's not gonna die?
- No, he'll be fine.

13:55.309 --> 13:56.768
Come with me. I'll show you.

13:59.480 --> 14:01.472
- My sister is unconscious.
- What happened?

14:01.648 --> 14:04.850
She had a skating accident.
They took care of her at St. Anne's...

14:05.025 --> 14:07.860
...sent her home. But in the car
she started shaking all over.

14:08.028 --> 14:11.728
- Sounds like a seizure. What's her name?
- Reba. I couldn't wake her up.

14:11.906 --> 14:14.444
Reba! Reba, can you hear me?

14:14.617 --> 14:18.198
She's postictal. Let's start a line.
15 liters O-2 by mask.

14:18.369 --> 14:20.278
- Does she have a history of seizures?
- No.

14:20.454 --> 14:22.826
We were at the skating rink,
and a boy ran into her.

14:22.998 --> 14:25.667
- Her legs were cut badly.
- Pupils equal, round, reactive.

14:25.834 --> 14:28.503
- Did she hit her head?
- I think so. She had a headache.

14:28.670 --> 14:30.163
- Were x-rays taken?
- I don't know.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.748
They stitched up her legs.

14:31.922 --> 14:33.499
Responsive to pain.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.246
BP 120/70, pulse 56.

14:36.426 --> 14:38.751
- We need a head CT.
- What's going on?

14:38.928 --> 14:41.845
Your sister had a seizure,
which can happen after a head injury.

14:42.014 --> 14:45.428
We'll take an x-ray of her brain
to make sure there's no bleeding, okay?

14:45.641 --> 14:46.672
Okay.

14:46.850 --> 14:51.144
A small gold pendant would be nice.
Earrings. Ford Explorer.

14:51.313 --> 14:54.432
Thank you, Lydia. I'll keep those
in mind. How serious?

14:54.607 --> 14:57.061
Seizure after head trauma.
They saw her at St. Anne's.

14:57.233 --> 14:59.356
Barkley's the chief there.
You want me to call?

14:59.527 --> 15:01.603
- They didn't even do a CT.
- Hey, doctor.

15:01.779 --> 15:03.985
- We wrapped up that hit-and-run.
- That quick?

15:04.156 --> 15:06.825
Witness ID'd the plates.
Get this, it was his wife.

15:06.992 --> 15:08.534
Come on.

15:08.702 --> 15:10.610
- Lydia, where's Brown?
- Who?

15:10.786 --> 15:13.193
- Ethan Brown who got hit by a car.
- Exam 4.

15:13.372 --> 15:15.364
Call Security.

15:22.587 --> 15:23.867
Die!

15:24.505 --> 15:26.083
You bastard!

15:26.257 --> 15:29.922
- I hate you! I'm gonna kill you!
- Get her out of here!

15:30.094 --> 15:34.719
- Let go of me!
- Cyanotic. Pulse ox's down to 70.

15:34.889 --> 15:37.509
Hyperventilate him. Blood gas?

15:42.437 --> 15:45.390
- What was that about?
- Marital bliss.

15:48.776 --> 15:50.601
After dinner,
power Christmas shopping.

15:50.776 --> 15:52.852
Everything for everyone
in under three hours.

15:53.028 --> 15:54.902
You could shop
for Jennifer and Rachel.

15:55.072 --> 15:57.741
Rachel's getting a bike.
Jennifer already has her present.

15:57.908 --> 16:03.744
I agreed to spend four, count them, four
wintry days with her folks in Sheboygan.

16:03.820 --> 16:07.619
Four days with the Reverend?
Go with God.

16:08.499 --> 16:10.705
- How's she doing?
- She's coming around.

16:10.876 --> 16:13.449
Hi, Reba. I'm Dr. Lewis.
Do you know where you are?

16:15.379 --> 16:16.624
Hospital.

16:16.797 --> 16:21.589
- Do you remember what happened?
- No.

16:22.844 --> 16:25.631
It's normal to be confused
after a seizure.

16:25.805 --> 16:28.840
We wanna keep her in the hospital
for a while under-

16:29.015 --> 16:30.593
Valium, five.

16:31.184 --> 16:32.975
- What's happening?
- Valium, five!

16:33.144 --> 16:36.014
- Pulse ox 85.
- Put her back on the mask.

16:36.188 --> 16:38.726
Help her, please!

16:42.526 --> 16:45.894
Dr. Vucelich. Carter. John Carter.

16:46.071 --> 16:49.024
Carter, yes. I'm gonna see
your Dr. Matthews at 5, right?

16:49.198 --> 16:52.199
No, actually, I'm Dr. Benton's student.

16:52.368 --> 16:54.988
In that case, I look forward
to seeing him later, then.

16:55.161 --> 16:57.533
No, actually, he's not signed up.

16:57.705 --> 17:00.908
He wanted to be,
but I believe your list was full.

17:01.083 --> 17:04.367
You don't have to cover for him.
If the man isn't interested...

17:04.544 --> 17:07.710
No, he is definitely interested.

17:07.880 --> 17:11.213
To be honest, I forgot to sign him up.

17:11.715 --> 17:13.258
And he was pretty upset about it.

17:13.425 --> 17:16.130
I see. I guess I'm gonna have
to cover for you then.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.212
Why don't you send him in at 6.

17:18.388 --> 17:20.760
I think it's a hickey
you have on your neck, Carter.

17:20.933 --> 17:22.758
Yeah, yeah.

17:22.933 --> 17:24.261
That makes 20 of Valium.

17:24.435 --> 17:26.426
- How long has she been seizing?
-10 minutes.

17:26.603 --> 17:30.221
Load her with Dilantin,
900 milligrams at 15 minutes.

17:30.398 --> 17:33.482
She's probably tearing
her sutures out.

17:36.569 --> 17:38.229
- Is she on any drugs?
- No.

17:38.404 --> 17:40.811
- Diabetic?
- No.

17:40.990 --> 17:43.315
- Is she allergic to lidocaine?
- Lidocaine?

17:43.492 --> 17:46.065
Like Novocain. They'd give it
to her before the sutures.

17:46.244 --> 17:48.912
I don't know. They were injecting her
with a lot of stuff.

17:49.079 --> 17:50.573
Hold the Dilantin.

17:50.747 --> 17:53.203
Eight hundred phenobarb.
Could be lidocaine toxicity.

17:53.375 --> 17:54.917
- Get a level.
- One hundred in.

17:55.126 --> 17:59.254
Conni, get a hold of Dr. Barkley at
St. Anne's and have him fax her chart.

17:59.421 --> 18:02.754
- I know I gave you nights off this week.
- Thank you.

18:02.924 --> 18:06.339
Not that it did any good. Hudson pleaded
with me to cover for him tonight.

18:06.510 --> 18:09.926
- You couldn't cover for Bowers?
- I'm good, but not that good.

18:10.097 --> 18:12.468
Reba Siburry's seizures.

18:14.224 --> 18:16.596
St. Anne's gave her
a toxic dose of lidocaine?

18:16.768 --> 18:19.519
- Her level was nine.
- I missed all the fun.

18:19.687 --> 18:21.430
This'll make a terrific case report.

18:21.606 --> 18:23.764
Morgenstern wants someone
to present a paper...

18:23.941 --> 18:25.565
...at the SAEM conference.

18:25.734 --> 18:29.433
- I could use the credit.
- The hospital pays for the trip.

18:29.612 --> 18:32.778
- Trip?
- It's in Miami.

18:32.948 --> 18:35.521
It sounds like a terrific opportunity.

18:36.826 --> 18:39.910
- I can't write and present a paper.
- Sure you can.

18:40.079 --> 18:42.995
- And take care of Susie?
- I thought your dad was gonna help.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.785
I still barely have time
to get dressed in the morning.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.283
I could help you
with your schedule here.

18:48.460 --> 18:52.754
That's great, but I can't spend my
days off in the library doing research.

18:52.923 --> 18:56.041
- And a trip?
- Okay.

18:56.216 --> 18:58.422
- Are you disappointed?
- Of course not.

18:58.593 --> 19:01.713
- Do you think I should do it?
- It's your decision.

19:04.348 --> 19:08.131
Do your voices tell you
to harm yourself?

19:08.309 --> 19:10.716
- Harm anyone else?
- Voice, voices, voices...

19:10.895 --> 19:14.429
I don't- I don't hear voices.

19:14.606 --> 19:16.266
You wanna stay in the hospital?

19:16.441 --> 19:21.148
I'm not crazy or whatever you think.

19:21.319 --> 19:23.893
You might wanna try new medicines,
fewer side effects-

19:24.072 --> 19:27.487
Thank you. No. I have work to...

19:29.201 --> 19:30.992
May I?

19:31.161 --> 19:33.154
Here, Josh.

19:33.412 --> 19:37.112
- How you gonna eat, Josh?
- The Colonel makes me chicken.

19:37.291 --> 19:41.122
- And sleep?
- I'm building a house.

19:41.294 --> 19:45.161
- It's cold outside.
- I know! I have a jacket!

19:45.339 --> 19:48.505
I know how to take care of myself.

19:48.675 --> 19:51.426
- I'm a man...
- Okay.

19:51.594 --> 19:54.760
Josh, it was nice meeting you.

19:55.014 --> 19:57.172
Come on, let's go.

20:02.227 --> 20:03.472
- Can you hold him?
- Nope.

20:03.645 --> 20:07.014
Not even for a day?
I can place him in a halfway house.

20:07.190 --> 20:10.393
He's in no danger to himself or
anyone else. There's nothing I can do.

20:10.568 --> 20:13.022
Can he take care of himself
on the street?

20:13.194 --> 20:15.601
- He claims he can.
- And you take his word for it?

20:15.780 --> 20:21.022
I didn't write the law. He's an adult.
If he wants to go, he goes.

20:22.369 --> 20:24.694
Guess Joshua is off
his checklist for the day.

20:24.871 --> 20:28.819
He must get 30 cases like this
a month. He does what he can.

20:28.999 --> 20:31.371
- So, what do we do?
- Well, we try and stall him.

20:31.584 --> 20:35.747
Hope that a home comes through,
wait for the mother to show.

20:36.881 --> 20:40.046
I got Benton that interview at 6.
It's 15 minutes to your house.

20:40.216 --> 20:43.667
That gives us an hour and 20 minutes
before study group, which is nothing.

20:43.844 --> 20:46.631
- Look what you did to my neck.
- You're an incurable romantic.

20:46.805 --> 20:49.640
- Only one problem, though.
- Carter!

20:49.808 --> 20:52.760
Oh, man. I haven't told him yet.
See you later.

20:56.020 --> 20:57.395
- Hi.
- I got a patient for you.

20:57.563 --> 21:00.232
Great. I was wondering,
do you have plans this evening?

21:00.399 --> 21:02.641
I'm asking
because I bumped into Dr. Vucelich.

21:02.818 --> 21:05.391
- And?
- What? Nothing.

21:05.570 --> 21:07.478
- You signed me up?
- No, not really.

21:07.654 --> 21:08.899
You better not have.

21:09.072 --> 21:11.907
He requested you. He thinks
you'd be great for this study.

21:12.075 --> 21:17.495
And he wants to talk to you about it
in his office at 6. Tonight. Today.

21:17.663 --> 21:21.362
Do a two percent block, irrigate.
Pull the nail. No stitches.

21:25.711 --> 21:27.122
Hi, Josh.

21:27.296 --> 21:28.955
I have to go.

21:29.131 --> 21:32.415
But we're not finished yet.

21:33.925 --> 21:35.918
What?

21:37.262 --> 21:41.010
Hey, Josh. This is really good.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.137
I just draw what they tell me to.

21:45.310 --> 21:47.183
I have to go home.

21:47.353 --> 21:49.061
I have to.

21:52.399 --> 21:55.565
- Where is your home?
- I just bought one.

21:55.735 --> 21:59.067
- Where?
- Wicker Park, on Hoyne Street.

22:00.488 --> 22:03.061
Oh, yeah. Jugendstil, Proto-Modern.

22:03.241 --> 22:05.363
I guess, maybe.

22:05.534 --> 22:07.610
It's nice. Very solid.

22:08.620 --> 22:13.328
Turn of the century. Living room.
Fireplace. Copper inlay. Tile.

22:13.499 --> 22:16.618
No fireplace. Just plaster walls.

22:16.793 --> 22:20.743
No, you go behind. It's there.
You'll see that it's there.

22:20.922 --> 22:25.748
Thanks. I didn't know I bought
a Juggen, Joggan thing.

22:26.759 --> 22:28.467
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

22:28.636 --> 22:32.005
- Hey, Josh, are you hungry?
- I...

22:32.181 --> 22:33.675
You should eat something.

22:33.849 --> 22:36.766
I'll let you keep the pencil.

22:36.935 --> 22:38.642
Okay?

22:40.395 --> 22:43.811
Okay? Okay.

22:46.734 --> 22:48.561
Your Psych patient still here?

22:48.736 --> 22:50.645
- Consult been down?
- Yep.

22:50.821 --> 22:52.647
- Not admitted?
- Nope.

22:52.822 --> 22:54.232
Why hasn't he been discharged?

22:54.406 --> 22:57.857
I'd like to put a sterile dressing
on his abrasion, antibiotic ointment.

22:58.035 --> 23:00.608
As long as we have a bed,
let's get him fed, cleaned up.

23:00.787 --> 23:03.242
- Good idea.
- Okay, 7:00?

23:03.414 --> 23:08.490
You look beautiful whatever you wear.
I love you too. Bye.

23:08.668 --> 23:11.337
Your personal obligation?

23:12.671 --> 23:14.580
ER. Hang on.

23:14.757 --> 23:16.132
Dr. Greene...

23:16.300 --> 23:19.085
...it's for you.
Willsborough Community Hospital.

23:19.260 --> 23:20.837
Where's that?

23:21.011 --> 23:23.502
Milwaukee.

23:25.140 --> 23:26.338
Hello?

23:26.516 --> 23:29.600
What happened?

23:29.769 --> 23:33.847
Oh, God! Is she all right?

23:34.021 --> 23:36.773
Rachel? My daughter?

23:36.941 --> 23:39.941
Of course. I'll be there
as soon as I can.

23:40.110 --> 23:41.355
Mark?

23:42.362 --> 23:45.979
Jen and Rachel. They're at a hospital.
I gotta catch a train.

23:46.156 --> 23:49.359
- What happened?
- Car accident.

23:49.576 --> 23:53.193
- Is Rachel okay?
- It's only Jen.

23:53.412 --> 23:56.863
- Take my car. Here you go.
- Thanks.

24:04.755 --> 24:07.541
- Greene. Jennifer Greene.
- Any news?

24:07.716 --> 24:10.385
No, they won't tell me anything.

24:10.550 --> 24:13.634
Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

24:13.803 --> 24:15.843
- Are we this bad when people call?
- No.

24:16.014 --> 24:18.006
I give complete
and accurate information.

24:18.182 --> 24:23.720
- Anyone know anyone over there?
- I used to date one of their O.R. techs.

24:23.894 --> 24:27.429
- I haven't talked to him in six years.
- Dial.

24:30.525 --> 24:32.933
- That's cool.
- A patient gave it to me.

24:33.111 --> 24:35.518
Which patient's doing a drawing
of the Sullivan Arch?

24:35.696 --> 24:37.688
Sullivan?
Joshua calls himself Sullivan.

24:37.864 --> 24:42.075
Louis, Lewis, something like that.
It's over at the Art Institute.

24:42.243 --> 24:46.287
He says it's his home.
Unfortunately it's about to be true.

24:47.789 --> 24:50.705
- Shep, no, no, no, give me that back.
- Oh, no. Come on.

24:50.874 --> 24:52.285
Is that you?

24:52.459 --> 24:55.460
- You were cute. Stop, stop, stop!
- Come on, give it back!

24:55.628 --> 25:00.586
- "To the coolest girl in the class. "
- Okay. Very funny.

25:00.758 --> 25:04.624
"I'll never forget what you did for me
last summer at the lake.

25:04.802 --> 25:06.759
Love, P.J. "

25:07.513 --> 25:11.131
Oh, yeah? What did you do
to make him so grateful?

25:11.308 --> 25:13.680
It's a "her," not a "him. "

25:13.852 --> 25:16.520
I was calming her down because
she broke up with her boy-

25:16.687 --> 25:19.142
- I don't need to be telling you this.
- This is great.

25:19.314 --> 25:20.559
This is trash.

25:20.732 --> 25:22.689
No. This is going home.

25:23.484 --> 25:24.978
You're gonna thank me one day.

25:25.319 --> 25:28.355
This is good stuff.

25:30.656 --> 25:33.325
Food poisoning in 4.

25:33.492 --> 25:36.161
And Morgenstern wants to see you.

25:36.328 --> 25:39.163
No, it's good news. About presenting
the lidocaine toxicity.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.074
Mark told Morgenstern
about the case?

25:41.249 --> 25:45.327
No, I did. He was very excited.
This is a great opportunity.

25:45.501 --> 25:50.210
- Finally got rid of that migraine in 5.
- Good. Food poisoning in 4.

25:52.466 --> 25:54.209
I can make that window of opportunity.

25:54.384 --> 25:55.629
- My place at 6?
- You got it.

25:55.802 --> 25:58.802
Carter. Harper. I need
to pull the drains on some post-ops.

25:58.971 --> 26:01.675
- Your interview's at 6.
- Which is why you're gonna do it.

26:01.848 --> 26:03.757
Harper, scalp lac in the Suture Room.

26:03.933 --> 26:08.511
- I have food poisoning in 4.
- Well, after the food poisoning in 4.

26:10.313 --> 26:13.598
Shem, Joshua. He's 28.
Diagnosed schizophrenic.

26:13.774 --> 26:17.641
- There's nothing.
- You gotta be kidding. Six months?

26:17.819 --> 26:21.105
No. I checked there too.
They don't have any beds.

26:21.281 --> 26:25.147
Okay. I'll try Carnegie House.
Okay, thanks. Bye.

26:29.745 --> 26:31.026
Doctor-?

26:44.382 --> 26:47.217
I see you've found all my patients.

26:48.719 --> 26:51.090
And they're all grateful
to still be with us.

26:51.262 --> 26:53.551
Endarterectomies?

26:53.723 --> 26:56.807
Thanks, Claire. Tell my wife
I'll meet her at the restaurant.

26:56.976 --> 26:58.683
You can't believe
the Christmas presents.

26:58.852 --> 27:01.425
- Must be hundreds.
- At least.

27:02.479 --> 27:04.472
Why don't you
come with me, Benton?

27:04.648 --> 27:07.483
I think you're gonna find this
interesting.

27:08.651 --> 27:11.225
- What about the interview?
- This is it.

27:19.368 --> 27:22.535
Excuse me.
I'm Madeline Shem. Joshua's mother.

27:22.704 --> 27:25.954
Hi. I'm Carol Hathaway.
I'm glad you came.

27:26.124 --> 27:30.072
- Was he hurt?
- No, just a small abrasion on his arm.

27:30.252 --> 27:32.209
We spoke to the residential home.

27:32.379 --> 27:35.581
But they won't take him back, I know.
He's run away so much.

27:35.757 --> 27:37.749
We've had no luck
getting him into another.

27:37.925 --> 27:40.416
Took us nine months
to get him into that one.

27:40.594 --> 27:43.926
- Could you take him home?
- I wish.

27:44.096 --> 27:47.547
Joshua's let go of everything.
His past, his family, our home.

27:47.724 --> 27:49.800
None of it means anything
to him anymore.

27:49.976 --> 27:51.933
He'd never stay.

27:53.604 --> 27:57.268
Hard to believe
he was gonna be an architect.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.349
Had a breakdown in college.

28:05.239 --> 28:07.314
Hi, Josh.

28:08.449 --> 28:12.528
I brought your pencils,
sharpened just the way you like.

28:12.703 --> 28:16.652
Thanks very much.
We've been waiting for these to arrive.

28:16.831 --> 28:21.408
I give him money,
which makes me feel better...

28:21.584 --> 28:24.751
...and his pencils,
which makes him feel better.

28:24.921 --> 28:28.254
It's really the only thing
he still cares about.

28:28.424 --> 28:29.622
Still.

28:32.761 --> 28:34.171
I love you, Josh.

28:38.973 --> 28:42.057
- Radial and ulnar pulses are strong.
- He's gonna need a tetanus.

28:42.226 --> 28:44.634
Give him five of morphine,
slow IV push.

28:44.812 --> 28:46.769
- Give me the bullet.
- Impaled foreign body.

28:46.939 --> 28:49.607
Fell off a ladder
onto a Christmas reindeer display.

28:49.774 --> 28:51.018
They're gonna fire me.

28:51.192 --> 28:54.394
Through and through left deltoid.
Distal neuro and vascular intact.

28:54.569 --> 28:57.985
- I crushed Rudolph.
- Darned expensive, those displays.

28:58.156 --> 29:00.113
- Your last meal?
- Breakfast.

29:00.283 --> 29:02.951
No, no, lunch- I don't know.

29:03.118 --> 29:05.406
- Feel this?
- Yeah.

29:05.578 --> 29:08.033
BP is 140/85. Pulse 110.

29:08.205 --> 29:11.372
- O.R. been notified? This?
- It's killing me.

29:11.542 --> 29:14.210
- O.R.'s ready.
- Gram of Ancef.

29:14.376 --> 29:16.333
Spectacular case earlier, Susan.

29:16.503 --> 29:19.338
It's a shoo-in for presentation
at the SAEM conference.

29:19.506 --> 29:21.498
Might even make it in the Annals.

29:21.674 --> 29:23.797
Doctors forget that
a benign anesthetic...

29:23.968 --> 29:27.751
...has the potential for cardiac
and neurological toxicity.

29:27.929 --> 29:30.502
Let's get this puppy up to the O. R.

29:30.681 --> 29:33.089
Call upstairs. Tell them we're en route.

29:33.976 --> 29:36.431
I presented at the conference
when I was a Resident.

29:36.603 --> 29:38.845
Terrific case, terrific opportunity.

29:39.022 --> 29:41.642
I left the visual aids on the plane.

29:41.815 --> 29:45.266
I have to decline your offer, Dr.
Morgenstern. Personal reasons.

29:45.443 --> 29:49.487
You do realize, don't you, you're a
candidate for Chief Resident next year?

29:49.655 --> 29:52.276
I know I need
to start presenting and publishing...

29:52.449 --> 29:54.073
...but now is not a very good time.

29:54.242 --> 29:55.949
There is never a good time.

29:56.118 --> 29:58.739
I just hate to see
the personal overwhelm the job.

29:58.954 --> 30:01.445
I'm not overwhelmed,
and I'm doing my job.

30:01.623 --> 30:05.241
Yes, but to build a career, you've got
to take on more responsibility.

30:05.543 --> 30:07.831
I've taken on plenty of responsibility.

30:08.003 --> 30:11.336
So you'll have to forgive me if I don't
stay after school these days...

30:11.506 --> 30:13.545
...to work for extra credit.

30:27.894 --> 30:31.559
Where's Emergency? My wife
and daughter were in an accident.

30:31.731 --> 30:35.063
- Where's Emergency?
- Over there.

30:44.366 --> 30:46.986
Dr. Connors, report to Station 7.

30:48.285 --> 30:50.076
- Where is the ER?
- This is the ER.

30:50.245 --> 30:52.617
- Jennifer and Rachel Greene?
- Sorry?

30:52.789 --> 30:56.620
I'm Mark Greene. My wife and
daughter have been in an accident.

30:57.126 --> 30:59.083
- Just sent up to O.R.
- What floor?

30:59.253 --> 31:02.371
Second. Take the stairs. It's faster.

31:20.603 --> 31:22.476
Jen! Jen! I'm here.

31:22.646 --> 31:25.184
I'm okay, Mark. Rachel's okay.

31:25.357 --> 31:26.933
Where's Rachel?
Where's my daughter?

31:27.108 --> 31:30.227
- Probably in the waiting area.
- She's okay.

31:30.402 --> 31:32.608
- I wanna stay with my wife.
- You can't right now.

31:32.779 --> 31:35.531
- I'm a doctor.
- I'm Dr. Shreiger.

31:35.698 --> 31:37.607
- What are you, a Resident?
- Yes.

31:37.784 --> 31:39.775
I'll be working under Dr. Musgrave.

31:39.951 --> 31:43.616
- You can't be in here, Dr. Greene.
- I'd like to talk to the Attending.

31:43.788 --> 31:46.195
She has multiple injuries
from being broadsided.

31:46.373 --> 31:49.540
She's stable, but she's got
a compound right tib-fib fracture.

31:49.710 --> 31:52.745
- The films?
- Abdominal CTshowed free blood.

31:52.920 --> 31:54.793
We're gonna do
an exploratory laparotomy.

31:54.963 --> 31:57.205
And we'll have an orthopod in
to fix the fracture.

31:57.382 --> 31:58.959
Have a seat in the waiting room.

31:59.134 --> 32:01.920
Dr. Musgrave will find you
when we're through.

32:14.855 --> 32:17.392
Susan! This came for you.
I had to sign for it.

32:17.565 --> 32:19.889
Secret admirer?

32:21.693 --> 32:23.685
- Is it from Chloe?
- The one and only.

32:23.861 --> 32:25.770
Might as well open it.

32:32.035 --> 32:35.070
These are $100 bills.
It's, like, 20 of them.

32:35.245 --> 32:38.910
- Thirty of them, she says.
- Three thousand dollars?

32:39.082 --> 32:40.660
Are they marked in sequential?

32:40.834 --> 32:43.620
- What'd she write?
- You read it.

32:45.378 --> 32:47.287
"Ho, ho, ho, little Susie.

32:47.463 --> 32:50.215
Aren't you surprised
your mommy is so rich?

32:50.383 --> 32:52.422
Give this green stuff to Aunt Susie...

32:52.593 --> 32:55.048
...for helping out
and doing so much for you.

32:55.220 --> 32:56.762
Do you remember me?

32:56.930 --> 32:59.634
Loves and kisses, your crazy mom. "

32:59.807 --> 33:03.009
- She must have been stoned.
- That's a holiday thing, you know.

33:03.185 --> 33:05.224
Brings out the ghosts
of deadbeat relatives.

33:05.395 --> 33:07.932
I come from a long line of them.

33:09.315 --> 33:10.892
I don't want her money.

33:11.066 --> 33:14.019
My advice,
you take what you can get...

33:14.193 --> 33:16.731
...and do not expect more.

33:19.823 --> 33:21.566
Hey. Hi.

33:22.534 --> 33:27.075
- Daddy, Daddy!
- Hi, how are you, baby? All right?

33:27.412 --> 33:30.247
- This is Craig, Daddy.
- Craig Simon.

33:30.415 --> 33:33.202
This is my daughter, Amanda.
We were all in the accident.

33:33.376 --> 33:36.875
- Hello.
- Hi. We've spoken on the phone before.

33:37.046 --> 33:39.084
Right, the appeals court.

33:40.005 --> 33:42.128
The kids are fine.

33:42.299 --> 33:45.300
Jennifer's got a bad break to her leg.
It's a...

33:45.469 --> 33:48.635
Compound fracture, yeah.
I talked to the doctor.

33:49.889 --> 33:54.181
We were going to a staff Christmas
party. A guy came out of nowhere.

33:54.350 --> 33:56.639
Yeah, she's a terrible driver.

33:57.311 --> 33:59.849
But I was driving.

34:01.982 --> 34:04.982
Our car was squished, Daddy.

34:09.154 --> 34:11.989
- Your head's all right?
- Yeah. It's nothing.

34:17.869 --> 34:20.074
I wanna make sure
that Jennifer's gonna be okay.

34:20.246 --> 34:23.330
If it's all right with you,
I think we'll stick around for a while.

34:23.498 --> 34:24.744
Sure.

34:34.674 --> 34:37.924
Randi! Randi!

34:38.094 --> 34:40.501
It's gonna be hard for people
to see through that.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.636
- They can walk around.
- I'm out of here.

34:42.806 --> 34:45.556
If you hear anything about Mark,
will you call my machine?

34:46.851 --> 34:49.969
Bad news for Joshua. St. Joe's,
Lacey Street, Carnegie House.

34:50.145 --> 34:53.014
All the residential homes have
a wait list of 600 years.

34:53.188 --> 34:56.190
It's too late anyway.
He left an hour ago.

34:58.693 --> 35:02.821
- He's too sick to be out there.
- He's not sick enough to stay in here.

35:02.989 --> 35:04.696
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

35:04.865 --> 35:07.700
In Rehab, I feel like I'm giving
the patients something.

35:07.868 --> 35:09.611
- We give them something.
- A Band-Aid...

35:09.786 --> 35:12.869
- ... and send them back to the front.
- Treat them and street them.

35:13.080 --> 35:14.325
We do the best we can.

35:14.498 --> 35:16.455
And when that's not good enough?

35:16.625 --> 35:18.167
Most days it has to be.

35:31.512 --> 35:34.465
You're familiar with endarterectomy
for the prevention of stroke?

35:34.639 --> 35:35.884
I've done some reading.

35:36.057 --> 35:39.389
And you also know that symptomatic
patients with stenotic lesions...

35:39.559 --> 35:42.228
...do better with surgery
than with medical care alone.

35:42.395 --> 35:46.262
- Not all studies agree.
- True. When do doctors ever agree?

35:46.440 --> 35:48.397
You're familiar with
the CASANOVA trials?

35:48.567 --> 35:50.974
Carotid artery stenosis with
asymptomatic narrowing.

35:51.152 --> 35:55.694
- Operation versus aspirin.
- Right. And what did they find?

35:55.864 --> 35:58.189
No benefit from endarterectomy.

35:58.366 --> 36:00.608
Well, I'm about to prove them wrong.

36:00.785 --> 36:04.069
I really wasn't planning
on hiring third-years for my studies.

36:04.246 --> 36:06.617
- They don't have the skills.
- I've got the skills.

36:06.789 --> 36:10.407
Really? You're arrogant as hell.

36:10.584 --> 36:11.782
I like that.

36:11.961 --> 36:14.119
Let's see those skills, doctor.

36:14.296 --> 36:15.576
Scrub in.

36:26.723 --> 36:28.596
Jennifer Greene?

36:28.766 --> 36:32.762
- I'm her husband, Dr. Mark Greene.
- Doctor, I'm Dr. Musgrave.

36:32.935 --> 36:35.224
- Everything went well.
- Thank God.

36:35.396 --> 36:38.147
I took a look at the spleen.
No rupture. No lacerations.

36:38.315 --> 36:43.438
Ortho did an internal fixation
of a fracture of the right tib-fib.

36:43.610 --> 36:46.183
No complications.
You can see her soon.

36:46.363 --> 36:50.277
- How long the screws gonna stay in?
- About six months.

36:50.616 --> 36:52.775
You can hold on to it. It's a copy.

36:52.952 --> 36:54.232
Thank you.

36:58.789 --> 37:01.410
Do you wanna translate for me?

37:04.628 --> 37:05.873
Hey.

37:07.881 --> 37:09.255
How are you?

37:11.258 --> 37:13.380
Let me look at you.

37:14.427 --> 37:16.633
Still ugly as sin.

37:17.805 --> 37:19.347
Let's get a drink.

37:19.515 --> 37:23.297
So, what about this fancy dinner?
Something wrong?

37:23.476 --> 37:25.966
Can't I just take you to
a nice restaurant?

37:26.145 --> 37:28.303
I would've thrown something
together at home.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.437
Mom, just let me do this.

37:30.607 --> 37:32.895
- Well, suit yourself.
- Thank you.

37:33.067 --> 37:35.309
What do you want?

37:35.735 --> 37:37.775
Champagne cocktail.

37:37.946 --> 37:39.689
Moët, please.

37:39.864 --> 37:42.319
I'll have a Manhattan, straight up.
Thanks.

37:45.035 --> 37:46.992
So how's my famous son doing?

37:47.162 --> 37:49.948
I'm still fixing kids for a living.
How's Howard?

37:50.122 --> 37:51.664
I never see him.

37:51.832 --> 37:56.742
Year-end tax deadline.
I'm a CPA widow. What can I say?

37:56.919 --> 37:59.208
Have you heard from anyone?

37:59.380 --> 38:01.538
Besides the Tribune
calling about you?

38:01.715 --> 38:04.964
- Anyone else?
- What's up, Douglas?

38:05.134 --> 38:06.925
Nothing is up.

38:07.094 --> 38:09.466
Now, don't even start. I know you.

38:11.098 --> 38:12.556
Dad called.

38:15.350 --> 38:16.892
What does he want?

38:17.060 --> 38:20.974
He saw me on TV,
and he just wanted to touch base.

38:21.147 --> 38:22.724
So, what did you say?

38:22.898 --> 38:25.389
I told him to get lost.

38:28.028 --> 38:31.775
- He wants money.
- He's not gonna get any money, so...

38:31.947 --> 38:36.692
Does he think he can just waltz into
our lives any damn time he wants to?

38:36.868 --> 38:39.441
I didn't tell you this to upset you.

38:41.622 --> 38:45.156
- He's up to something, Doug.
- Just forget about him.

38:49.712 --> 38:52.878
Hey, he can't touch us...

38:53.048 --> 38:54.293
...ever again.

39:24.030 --> 39:25.904
Hi, Josh.

39:27.533 --> 39:30.238
- How are you doing?
- Why do you ask that?

39:33.247 --> 39:34.989
It's beautiful.

39:38.500 --> 39:42.248
They destroyed this in
nineteen seventy-something...

39:42.420 --> 39:46.465
We're gonna go
and rebuild, side part.

39:46.632 --> 39:48.125
Look, you forgot these.

39:49.717 --> 39:51.425
Thank you very much.

39:51.594 --> 39:54.085
We've been expecting these in...

39:56.307 --> 39:58.797
Is there anything else you need?

39:58.976 --> 40:02.806
We can always use-
If you have pencils...

40:05.105 --> 40:07.346
Good night, Josh.

40:07.524 --> 40:09.812
Try and stay warm, okay?

40:17.239 --> 40:20.822
- What did she say?
- She said, "Okay, hon. Let's go home. "

40:20.993 --> 40:23.697
The beauty of codependency.

40:23.870 --> 40:25.530
Hey.

40:25.705 --> 40:28.954
Hi. Jeanie and I
are just drowning our bad day.

40:29.124 --> 40:30.950
Over root beer.

40:31.126 --> 40:33.830
- How was surgery?
- Slow. I held a clamp.

40:34.003 --> 40:37.372
- Sorry about tonight.
- Did you guys have a date?

40:37.548 --> 40:40.299
A date? During med school?
What, are you kidding?

40:40.466 --> 40:42.957
- How many more years?
- Counting the Air Force?

40:43.135 --> 40:44.713
Air Force?

40:44.887 --> 40:47.804
She felt like she needed
a little more direction in her life.

40:47.973 --> 40:50.463
Did a lot of drugs.
Didn't do well in high school.

40:50.642 --> 40:53.844
- Fifteenth in a class of 2000.
- Could have done better.

40:54.019 --> 40:56.509
And in college I knew I wanted more.

40:56.688 --> 41:00.139
- Be a fighter pilot.
- And a doctor. So one semester-

41:00.316 --> 41:02.641
This really good-looking
recruiter comes by-

41:02.818 --> 41:04.857
And I signed up.
You have been listening?

41:05.028 --> 41:07.862
- Yeah, I've been listening.
- They're paying for med school...

41:08.030 --> 41:11.315
...and after residency,
I give them four years of service.

41:11.491 --> 41:13.982
My husband thought I was
an overachiever.

41:14.160 --> 41:17.659
She hasn't even gotten to
the astronaut part.

41:25.127 --> 41:27.665
Sorry. Ride's over.

41:30.340 --> 41:32.831
- Forgot my soap.
- Hi, Mrs. Bassett.

41:33.009 --> 41:35.962
Your baby's getting so big.

41:36.136 --> 41:38.294
Oh, well, actually she's...

41:39.555 --> 41:42.307
Oh, and beautiful.
Just like your mama.

41:42.475 --> 41:45.179
- Thank you.
- She's really cute.

41:45.602 --> 41:47.345
Yes, you are.

41:48.354 --> 41:50.180
- Good night.
- Good night.

42:01.197 --> 42:03.688
I used to love this.

42:08.078 --> 42:11.198
There better not be anybody
behind this wall.

42:17.419 --> 42:18.699
Watch out!

42:28.011 --> 42:29.386
Fireplace?

42:29.554 --> 42:31.345
It's beautiful.

42:31.514 --> 42:34.265
- How did you know about this?
- I met an architect today.

42:34.433 --> 42:36.224
He knew about my house.

42:36.643 --> 42:38.470
An architect?

42:38.645 --> 42:40.802
Dance with me.

42:40.979 --> 42:42.557
To this?

42:42.731 --> 42:44.189
Oh, you don't know how?

42:46.317 --> 42:48.226
Okay.

42:49.779 --> 42:51.985
Now you've gone too far.

43:28.559 --> 43:30.516
Hi, baby.

43:31.062 --> 43:32.804
Mark.

43:34.439 --> 43:38.566
I spoke with the doctor.
Everything went really well.

43:39.735 --> 43:41.692
- Rachel?
- She's fine.

43:42.279 --> 43:44.816
In the waiting room.

43:47.449 --> 43:49.525
Is Craig still here?

43:52.912 --> 43:54.739
Yeah, he is.

43:59.041 --> 44:00.915
Oh, Mark...

44:02.545 --> 44:04.288
I know.

44:04.463 --> 44:07.417
We don't have to talk now.

44:07.591 --> 44:09.049
When you come home.

44:14.596 --> 44:17.051
I didn't wanna tell you
before Christmas.

44:19.100 --> 44:20.558
I know.

44:24.104 --> 44:25.680
I know, Jen.

44:40.033 --> 44:41.990
You fell in love with him?

44:44.620 --> 44:47.241
I didn't mean to.

44:48.305 --> 44:54.326
