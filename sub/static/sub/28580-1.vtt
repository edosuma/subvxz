Yeah, no, I'm glad that
a half an hour research

pulled up the name I could've

I've read rumors about a
supernatural bat creature in Gotham,

21:27.087 --> 21:28.852
but I assumed it was
an urban legend

21:28.854 --> 21:30.620
or that he was
a mutant like us.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.356
That guy was definitely human,

21:32.358 --> 21:35.992
and I think his supernatural
powers were just his gadgets.

we already know what he is.

Hmm.

21:46.573 --> 21:48.341
Forty percent less awesome.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.610
No one knows his motives,
but it does appear

21:53.612 --> 21:55.378
that he only attacks criminals

21:55.380 --> 21:57.347
especially this clown guy.

21:57.349 --> 22:01.051
So he wears a Dracula costume

to Gotham,

22:12.898 --> 22:15.764

this bat creep.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.302

22:19.304 --> 22:21.904
The way he fought,

were my lizard guys.

23:12.156 --> 23:13.989
They're turtles.

23:13.991 --> 23:18.160
And the DNA on this weapon suggests
they were mutated by an outside agent.

23:18.162 --> 23:20.296
The technology the ninjas
have already stolen

23:20.298 --> 23:23.332
could be used to refine
a mutagen like that.

23:23.334 --> 23:24.766

BATMAN: The cloud seeder is
the last piece of the puzzle.

secure location outside of Gotham.

you brought me in on this.

There were too many unknowns.
You could've gotten hurt.

23:40.784 --> 23:43.918

start working on a way to counteract

23:43.920 --> 23:45.121

23:45.889 --> 23:47.290
I could use your help.

Although if those creatures left
Penguin's men tied up for the police.

23:54.297 --> 23:55.899

about them.

23:56.566 --> 23:57.801
Maybe.

25:28.956 --> 25:31.223

are encrypted too heavily

been tracking the laboratory break-ins.

I have put another agent on that task.

is here.

29:45.642 --> 29:48.209

are scheming.

29:48.211 --> 29:50.781
I'd appreciate
being left out of it.

Not me, I'm in.

29:54.952 --> 30:01.123

I'm just dying for a rematch.

30:40.663 --> 30:44.798
It'll just take a second,
it's very important.

So, this League of Assassins seems just
like your standard evil ninja deal.

32:35.876 --> 32:38.343
Ha, hardly, despite
their name.

32:38.345 --> 32:41.513
The League would be better
understood as a death cult.

ROBIN: The Demon's head.

32:47.488 --> 32:49.054
Okay, fine.

32:49.056 --> 32:51.389
Creepy evil ninjas then.

32:51.391 --> 32:54.726
He wants to use the League to
tear down cities like Gotham

32:54.728 --> 32:56.595
and rebuild them
in his image.

32:56.597 --> 32:58.930
Yeah, Ra's obviously
has plans for the mutagen

brought into the city.

Right, Shredder gives
ghoulie the Ooze,

33:10.911 --> 33:14.545
they build some kind of gizmo and
in return, let me get this straight,

33:14.547 --> 33:17.381
Shredder gets a pit?

33:17.383 --> 33:19.050
The Lazarus Pit.

33:19.052 --> 33:22.286
It's how Ra's al Ghul
has survived for centuries.

33:22.288 --> 33:26.224
It's magic grants immortality
to any who bathe in it

33:26.226 --> 33:28.260
An immortal Shredder?

33:28.262 --> 33:30.795
That would suck.

33:30.797 --> 33:33.330
As much as the words immortal
Shredder freak me out.

solved one of our problems.

- I can call you that, right?
- By all means.

33:39.872 --> 33:41.806
Cool that Donnie
had on his T-phone

33:41.808 --> 33:44.041
I've whipped up
a retro mutagen.

33:44.043 --> 33:46.010
Anti-Ooze.

33:46.012 --> 33:50.014
Not gonna call it that. That will
reverse the effects of the stuff.

33:50.016 --> 33:54.485
You're gonna wanna get that anti-Ooze
away from this happily mutated turtle.

33:54.487 --> 33:57.021
Don't worry, it'll only work
on someone who's been mutated

33:57.023 --> 33:58.422
in the last 12 hours.

33:58.424 --> 34:00.057
After that, the DNA changes
are baked in.

Yeah, although maybe
worry a little,

34:01.961 --> 34:04.895
because it's untested,
right now there's a...

chance of lethal side effects.

you'd have had a chance.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.954
A chance? I won just now.

34:30.956 --> 34:33.889
I'm still recovering from
whatever Shredder did to me.

34:33.891 --> 34:35.958
I've never seen
an attack like that.
