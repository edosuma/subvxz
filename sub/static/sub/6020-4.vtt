WEBVTT

00:04.288 --> 00:06.618
- I wouldn't walk over there.
- Why not?

00:06.691 --> 00:09.191
Because it's the most dangerous part
of the sidewalk.

00:09.260 --> 00:10.987
A cab hops a curb:

00:11.062 --> 00:13.323
You've had your last egg sandwich.

00:13.397 --> 00:17.058
What about over there? You know,
air conditioners fall out all the time.

00:17.135 --> 00:21.171
I'd much rather get hit by an 80-pound
air conditioner than a two-ton cab.

00:21.239 --> 00:23.864
No, no, cab's coming up right here.

00:23.941 --> 00:25.770
Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs...

00:25.843 --> 00:28.377
a monkey to answer the phone,
I'm back in business.

00:28.446 --> 00:33.040
I'd much rather take one in the head,
like I did in '79.

00:33.651 --> 00:36.185
You were living
in the Village then, right?

00:36.788 --> 00:39.152
I don't really remember.

00:47.131 --> 00:49.256
Toxic-waste green.

00:49.333 --> 00:51.128
That is disgusting.

00:51.202 --> 00:54.829
You know, revulsion has now become
a valid form of attraction.

00:54.906 --> 00:57.304
Well, then, you're driving me wild.

00:57.742 --> 01:00.276
I had them done for
the big Peterman bash I'm throwing.

01:00.344 --> 01:01.741
Why are you having a party?

01:01.813 --> 01:05.178
Oh, I drive my people hard,
and then I reward them.

01:05.248 --> 01:07.510
- Like with dogs.
- Yeah, exactly.

01:07.585 --> 01:09.084
Party?

01:09.587 --> 01:12.019
- Yeah.
- Food?

01:12.757 --> 01:14.757
- Bar?
- Yeah.

01:14.826 --> 01:16.553
George?

01:18.095 --> 01:20.095
He's gonna show up anyway.

01:20.164 --> 01:22.323
George, I just don't
want you interfering.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.559
How could I possibly interfere?

01:24.635 --> 01:26.635
Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?

01:32.944 --> 01:35.604
These are fantastic. Fantastic.

01:35.680 --> 01:38.044
You know, I'd love to get a jump
on the next batch.

01:38.115 --> 01:39.944
Where do you come out of?

01:43.855 --> 01:47.413
She's been ignoring this section
all evening.

01:48.693 --> 01:51.057
- Quesadilla?
- No thanks.

01:52.430 --> 01:55.294
- Hi, my name is George.
- Anna.

01:56.534 --> 01:58.727
I don't recall seeing you
around the office.

01:58.803 --> 02:00.234
Do you work in the mailroom?

02:01.305 --> 02:04.704
Not quite. I... I'm a friend
of Elaine Benes.

02:04.775 --> 02:07.639
Oh, that's nice. Excuse me.

02:07.712 --> 02:09.473
So....

02:10.914 --> 02:12.448
How about leading us in a toast?

02:12.516 --> 02:13.844
Oh, sure.

02:13.918 --> 02:15.849
Hey, guys, I wanna make a toast.

02:17.088 --> 02:20.817
Here's to those who wish us well...

02:20.892 --> 02:24.484
and those who don't
can go to hell.

02:27.999 --> 02:30.124
All right. Who's dancing?

02:30.201 --> 02:31.529
Come on, who's dancing?

02:31.602 --> 02:35.729
You want...? You want me to get it
started? I'll get it started. All right.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:49.754 --> 02:52.254
Come on, guys.
What's the holdup?

02:54.792 --> 02:58.259
Sweet, fancy Moses.

03:04.702 --> 03:07.100
Hey. You get the tickets?

03:07.171 --> 03:11.765
- Who needs two?
- Oh, mamacita! Let me see them.

03:11.842 --> 03:13.569
Special sneak preview
of Death Blow.

03:13.644 --> 03:17.339
Death Blow. When someone
tries to blow you up...

03:17.415 --> 03:19.005
not because of who you are...

03:19.083 --> 03:21.777
but because
of different reasons altogether.

03:23.654 --> 03:25.415
Yeah? Come on up.

03:25.489 --> 03:28.956
Hey, Jerry, you think you could get
an extra ticket for my friend Brody?

03:29.026 --> 03:31.060
Know what I had to go
through to get these?

03:31.128 --> 03:33.059
But he's a big fan of the genre.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.131
You know, I'd consider it
a personal favor to me.

03:37.468 --> 03:40.628
Yeah, I guess I do owe you. Yeah.

03:41.505 --> 03:43.937
Listen, you want me to stay here
till George gets up?

03:44.008 --> 03:46.804
- No, I'm okay.
- There's no problem, really.

03:46.877 --> 03:48.342
I'm fine.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.711
- He's right in there, boy.
- Yeah, okay.

03:51.782 --> 03:54.373
Hey, how was the party?

03:54.618 --> 03:55.946
The food was good.

03:56.020 --> 03:57.644
Yeah, so, I didn't miss anything?

03:57.722 --> 04:01.986
Well, actually, you did miss
one little nugget of entertainment.

04:02.827 --> 04:04.952
Have you ever seen Elaine dance?

04:07.865 --> 04:09.830
Elaine danced?

04:11.769 --> 04:15.930
It was more like a full-body
dry heave set to music.

04:17.308 --> 04:20.002
Did she do the little kicks
and the thumbs?

04:20.444 --> 04:23.138
- Wait, you mean you know about this?
- For some time.

04:23.481 --> 04:25.947
It was about five years ago.

04:37.561 --> 04:39.856
I never knew what to say to her
about it.

04:40.097 --> 04:42.893
It was one of those problems
I hoped would just go away.

04:42.967 --> 04:46.230
Well, sometimes you can't help
these people till they hit rock bottom.

04:46.303 --> 04:47.893
And by then you've lost interest.

04:49.006 --> 04:53.805
Take a ride with me later.
I borrowed my father's car, '68 GTO.

04:53.878 --> 04:55.309
What made him get that thing?

04:55.379 --> 04:58.971
Well, during that period when my folks
were separated, he went a little crazy.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.341
Not a very long trip.

05:02.153 --> 05:04.949
- Brody's in.
- I don't even have the extra ticket yet.

05:05.022 --> 05:07.613
Well, you better get on the horn.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.519
I'm telling you, Jerry,
I'm getting a vibe.

05:11.595 --> 05:16.098
If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff
completely lost respect for me.

05:16.167 --> 05:17.859
How could that be?

05:17.935 --> 05:22.734
Well, Jerry, I mean,
it's like the feeling is palpable.

05:22.807 --> 05:24.898
Could it have something
to do with the party?

05:24.975 --> 05:27.566
No, George was there.
He said he had a great time.

05:27.645 --> 05:31.010
It's George. I bet you this is
somehow George-related.

05:31.082 --> 05:34.242
- Oh, what are you talking about?
- He's like a virus.

05:34.318 --> 05:37.683
He attaches himself
to a healthy host company...

05:37.755 --> 05:41.518
and the next thing you know,
the entire staff is infected.

05:41.592 --> 05:43.023
Now you're talking crazy.

05:43.094 --> 05:46.527
All right. Then, Jerry, if that's not
what it is, you tell me. What is it?

05:50.734 --> 05:54.133
There's my call waiting,
I gotta get going. Bye-bye.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.201
Have a minute
to approve some copy?

05:58.275 --> 06:00.707
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.

06:02.113 --> 06:05.239
So did you have a good time
at the party last night?

06:05.316 --> 06:08.146
It was a real kick.

06:09.220 --> 06:12.221
Hey, did you happen to speak
to my friend George?

06:12.723 --> 06:14.051
As a matter of fact, I did.

06:15.126 --> 06:18.957
Well, listen, you would be wise
to keep your distance from him.

06:19.029 --> 06:20.892
Why? He seems harmless.

06:20.965 --> 06:23.659
Oh, he's not. He's very harmful.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.035
- Really?
- Oh, trust me.

06:26.103 --> 06:27.864
He's a bad seed,
he's a horrible seed.

06:27.938 --> 06:30.006
He's one of the worst seeds
I've ever seen.

06:30.141 --> 06:31.833
And you two are friends?

06:31.909 --> 06:33.738
Yeah, we're good friends.

06:36.046 --> 06:39.081
So this Anna called me
from out of the blue.

06:39.150 --> 06:43.084
- Really? I thought you were rebuffed.
- With extreme prejudice.

06:43.154 --> 06:46.223
- Maybe Elaine put in a good word.
- No, no. See, that's the thing.

06:46.290 --> 06:50.121
Anna told me Elaine said I was one
of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.

06:50.194 --> 06:53.092
Interesting.
She doesn't care for you.

06:53.164 --> 06:54.697
Then a stern warning.

06:54.765 --> 06:56.264
Suddenly a phone call.

06:57.868 --> 07:00.129
Seems Elaine's made you
the bad boy.

07:00.204 --> 07:03.273
And Anna digs the bad boy.

07:04.542 --> 07:06.542
I'm the bad boy.

07:08.179 --> 07:10.474
I've never been the bad boy.

07:10.548 --> 07:13.344
You've been the bad employee,
the bad son, the bad friend.

07:13.417 --> 07:15.314
Yes. Yes, yes.

07:15.386 --> 07:17.818
The bad fiancÃ©, bad dinner guest,
bad credit risk.

07:17.888 --> 07:19.216
Okay, the point is made.

07:19.290 --> 07:22.791
The bad date, the bad sport,
the bad citizen.

07:23.627 --> 07:25.627
The bad tipper.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.460
Half of show business is here.

07:30.534 --> 07:34.001
Oh, there's Brody. Brody, over here.

07:34.872 --> 07:36.462
- Hey, Kramer.
- Yeah.

07:36.540 --> 07:39.837
And you must be Jerry.
Thanks for the ticket.

07:39.910 --> 07:42.740
That's quite a feedbag
you're working on there.

07:43.948 --> 07:46.744
It's for all of us. Is there a problem?

07:46.817 --> 07:49.681
Brody. Brody, come on,
he's just kidding.

07:49.753 --> 07:52.651
He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.

07:52.723 --> 07:54.484
I'm a joke maker.

07:55.960 --> 07:58.290
All right, here we go.

07:58.362 --> 08:00.521
Death Blow.

08:10.207 --> 08:11.706
Hey.

08:12.276 --> 08:13.673
What the hell is he doing?

08:13.744 --> 08:16.335
Relax, he does that all the time.

08:18.549 --> 08:19.980
Does what?

08:20.050 --> 08:23.711
He's making a copy of the movie
for sale on the street.

08:25.723 --> 08:27.848
May I see you outside
for a moment, please?

08:27.925 --> 08:30.323
- No, I want to watch the movie.
- Outside!

08:30.394 --> 08:32.018
Come on.

08:32.096 --> 08:35.529
- Hey, have you seen Anna?
- Just left to meet your friend George.

08:35.599 --> 08:36.859
To meet George?

08:36.967 --> 08:38.364
I knew it. Where did they go?

08:38.434 --> 08:40.162
- The park, why?
- Don't you see?

08:40.236 --> 08:41.861
George is in the bloodstream.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.404
You stay away from him too.

08:45.509 --> 08:47.270
What do you mean,
bootlegging the movie?

08:47.344 --> 08:49.378
It's a perfectly legitimate business.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.878
- It's not legitimate.
- It's a business.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.244
- Where did you meet this guy?
- Friend of a friend.

08:54.318 --> 08:56.352
You know Corky Ramirez
up on 94th Street?

08:56.420 --> 08:58.385
One day he and l
are playing pachinko...

08:58.455 --> 08:59.886
Kramer.

09:02.793 --> 09:05.726
Man, we're missing the deathblow!

09:05.796 --> 09:07.921
I don't believe it.

09:14.071 --> 09:17.231
You know, I'm not supposed to be
talking to you.

09:17.975 --> 09:20.566
No one's putting a gun
to your head.

09:22.713 --> 09:25.407
Do I scare you?

09:25.482 --> 09:27.174
No.

09:29.219 --> 09:30.843
A little.

09:32.022 --> 09:33.350
Nice car.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.122
Yeah.

09:35.426 --> 09:36.754
She's a sweet ride.

09:37.394 --> 09:39.257
Is that your orthopedic back pillow?

09:40.464 --> 09:41.929
Maybe.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.367
Well, is it, or isn't it?

09:45.836 --> 09:47.494
I guess not.

09:51.375 --> 09:53.534
- Stay away from her.
- Hey, I didn't do nothing.

09:53.610 --> 09:54.938
- Get in the car.
- But...

09:55.012 --> 09:58.104
You heard me, young lady.
Get in the car.

09:58.182 --> 10:00.580
And you! You should know better.

10:00.651 --> 10:02.946
I don't want you infecting my staff.

10:03.287 --> 10:05.184
Lighten up.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.701
Go get them, Death Blow.

10:23.774 --> 10:26.206
So, Death Blow, we meet again.

10:26.310 --> 10:27.638
Are you okay?

10:28.145 --> 10:29.803
I got a cramp.

10:29.980 --> 10:33.846
Well, it's no wonder.
You ate that entire bag of candy.

10:34.885 --> 10:37.317
There it goes again.

10:38.422 --> 10:40.251
Kramer, you gotta drive me home.

10:40.324 --> 10:41.652
What is going on over here?

10:41.725 --> 10:44.055
Jerry, finish shooting
the movie for me.

10:44.128 --> 10:46.492
Are you nuts? No way
I'm holding that thing.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.654
Jerry, the man is in pain.

10:48.732 --> 10:51.562
If he didn't lick his fingers
before reaching in the bag...

10:51.635 --> 10:53.965
we would have eaten some.
Serves him right.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.939
What are you, some kind
of tough guy?

10:57.007 --> 11:00.508
Okay. Let's everybody just relax.

11:01.812 --> 11:04.710
- Jerry, take the camera.
- All right, I'm taking the camera.

11:04.782 --> 11:07.407
All right, come on, let's go.
Thanks, buddy.

11:08.152 --> 11:10.015
Oh, man.

11:18.796 --> 11:20.386
Hey.

11:21.231 --> 11:22.855
So how was the rest
of Death Blow?

11:22.933 --> 11:24.591
How was the rest of Death Blow?

11:24.668 --> 11:26.065
Who got the final deathblow?

11:26.136 --> 11:28.727
I thought that Hawaiian guy
had it coming to him, huh?

11:28.806 --> 11:30.965
You make me get a ticket
for this friend...

11:31.041 --> 11:34.110
and then the guy forces me
to bootleg a movie at gunpoint?

11:34.178 --> 11:36.405
He's quite a character, isn't he?

11:36.480 --> 11:39.777
He came by here last night at 3:00
in the morning to pick up the tape.

11:39.850 --> 11:41.383
I was scared out of my mind.

11:42.719 --> 11:44.309
I'll get it.

11:44.655 --> 11:45.983
- Yup.
- It's Brody.

11:46.056 --> 11:48.920
Yeah, come on up.
It's Brody, he's coming.

11:48.992 --> 11:51.560
What? Are you crazy?
I don't want to see this guy again.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.059
Jerry, you did him a favor.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.891
He probably wants to thank you.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.794
What if I didn't do it right?

11:56.867 --> 11:58.935
It's your first time. He'll understand.

11:59.002 --> 12:01.696
People with guns don't understand.

12:01.772 --> 12:04.841
That's why they get guns.
Too many misunderstandings.

12:05.442 --> 12:07.942
- Hey, Brody.
- Hi.

12:08.011 --> 12:10.170
Jerry, I have to talk to you
about the tape.

12:10.247 --> 12:13.339
- Yeah.
- I've never seen such beautiful work.

12:13.417 --> 12:15.508
- What?
- You're a genius.

12:15.586 --> 12:19.247
The zoom-ins, the framing,
I was enchanted.

12:21.258 --> 12:22.723
Well...

12:22.793 --> 12:24.326
I did the best I could.

12:26.230 --> 12:28.924
I got another project for you.
Here, go ahead.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.657
It's a movie called Cry, Cry Again.

12:30.734 --> 12:34.133
I was gonna give it to one of my
other guys, but it's an arty movie...

12:34.204 --> 12:37.273
and quite frankly,
they don't have the sensibility.

12:40.544 --> 12:44.239
- May I use your phone?
- Yeah, yeah. It's under the couch.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.778
Look at you.
You got another gig, huh?

12:48.852 --> 12:50.886
I don't want another gig.

12:50.954 --> 12:52.385
I'm not doing this.

12:52.456 --> 12:55.855
But you have a gift. Look, Jerry,
this is not your little comedy act.

12:55.926 --> 12:57.994
We're talking feature films here.

12:58.061 --> 13:00.220
We're talking federal crime here.

13:03.033 --> 13:06.534
I'll expect that tape
by 3:00 tomorrow.

13:06.770 --> 13:09.430
- May I borrow this, please?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

13:09.506 --> 13:11.403
You need a glove?

13:14.611 --> 13:17.441
"l pressed through the rushes,
and there...

13:17.514 --> 13:20.515
the native dancers whirled
before me...

13:20.584 --> 13:24.313
Iimbs flailing, arms akimbo...

13:24.388 --> 13:26.581
feet kicking up dust."

13:26.657 --> 13:30.056
What? What is so funny?

13:30.127 --> 13:31.558
Sorry, I got hung up.

13:33.096 --> 13:34.595
At Yankee Stadium.

13:34.898 --> 13:37.262
This? It's mine.

13:37.334 --> 13:40.995
Oh, really? Because it looks
a little big for you.

13:41.071 --> 13:44.334
It looks like something
a short, stocky...

13:44.408 --> 13:47.636
slow-witted, bald man...

13:47.811 --> 13:49.572
might wear.

13:49.780 --> 13:51.347
He's not stocky.

13:53.984 --> 13:57.451
Who did that? Who did that?

14:03.994 --> 14:07.860
The French guy fell off his bike.

14:08.131 --> 14:12.031
Oh, man, that's precious.

14:15.172 --> 14:16.796
No, no, no...

14:16.873 --> 14:19.203
no, no, no.

14:19.276 --> 14:21.310
What were you thinking
when you shot this?

14:21.378 --> 14:24.311
- What? That's fine.
- You know what this scene is about?

14:24.381 --> 14:26.881
Yeah, it's about a guy
buying a loaf of bread.

14:26.950 --> 14:29.678
No. Bread is his soul.

14:29.753 --> 14:33.653
He's trying to buy back
a loaf of his soul.

14:33.724 --> 14:35.917
Wha... Where?

14:36.793 --> 14:39.919
No way you're giving this tape
to Brody and telling him I shot it.

14:39.997 --> 14:43.658
- He's not gonna know the difference.
- I don't care about Brody.

14:43.734 --> 14:45.324
I was up on 96th Street today.

14:45.402 --> 14:48.471
There was a little kid, couldn't
have been more than 10 years old.

14:48.538 --> 14:51.436
He was asking a street vendor
if he had any other bootlegs...

14:51.508 --> 14:54.168
that looked as good
as Death Blow.

14:54.344 --> 14:56.139
That's who I care about.

14:56.213 --> 14:58.508
The little kid who needs bootlegs...

14:58.582 --> 15:01.082
because his parent
or guardian won't let him see...

15:01.151 --> 15:03.913
the excessive violence
and strong sexual content...

15:03.987 --> 15:05.850
you and I take for granted.

15:06.523 --> 15:07.920
So you'll do the movie?

15:07.991 --> 15:11.424
Oh. Oh, man. I sat in gum.

15:11.795 --> 15:13.795
I have to.

15:13.930 --> 15:16.498
But I'm gonna need
to storyboard this whole thing.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.328
- Where are my Magic Markers?
- Right here.

15:19.403 --> 15:23.872
Well, I have lost
complete control of my staff.

15:23.940 --> 15:26.031
Why did I let George go
to that party?

15:26.443 --> 15:28.306
I mean, we were
having so much fun.

15:28.378 --> 15:32.380
I mean, we were wining,
we were dining, we were dancing.

15:34.551 --> 15:36.084
Please.

15:38.155 --> 15:41.190
- What?
- This... thing.

15:42.225 --> 15:45.294
- It's dancing.
- No, no. That ain't dancing, sally.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.054
I dance fine.

15:47.130 --> 15:48.356
You stink.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.532
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

15:59.176 --> 16:00.675
Jerry?

16:02.979 --> 16:04.478
Jerry?

16:06.483 --> 16:08.574
I'm a good dancer, right?

16:08.652 --> 16:10.879
I forgot to make my bed.

16:12.656 --> 16:15.589
Jerry, do I stink?

16:16.393 --> 16:18.256
All right. You're beyond stink.

16:21.264 --> 16:23.025
But I really enjoy dancing.

16:23.100 --> 16:25.600
And that's not helping either.

16:26.903 --> 16:30.404
That's why you're having trouble with
your staff, not because of George.

16:30.474 --> 16:32.508
It's that bad?

16:32.576 --> 16:34.075
Have you ever seen yourself?

16:36.980 --> 16:40.413
Please, please. Not in my home.

16:40.717 --> 16:43.809
I gotta throw this stuff in the laundry.
I'll be right back.

16:52.229 --> 16:54.797
I have George Costanza
still holding.

16:55.465 --> 16:57.123
George, hi.

16:57.534 --> 17:00.865
I have Anna here. There's something
I want to say to both of you.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.299
Yo, Anna.

17:02.372 --> 17:04.906
Hi, George, what are you up to?

17:06.476 --> 17:08.907
You don't wanna know.

17:12.449 --> 17:15.074
Well, listen, I feel
really horrible about...

17:15.152 --> 17:19.244
trying to keep you two apart,
and I just wanted to apologize.

17:19.321 --> 17:21.117
What...? What are you
talking about?

17:21.191 --> 17:24.749
Well, George, I just want you
to hear me say to Anna...

17:24.828 --> 17:27.624
that you're a good
and decent person.

17:27.696 --> 17:29.458
Pick up the phone, Elaine.
Pick it up.

17:29.533 --> 17:31.828
I never should have given Anna
the impression...

17:31.902 --> 17:33.594
- Pick it up!
- You're a bad seed...

17:33.670 --> 17:35.101
I mean, you're a fine seed.

17:35.172 --> 17:36.830
Elaine, get off the speaker!

17:38.608 --> 17:40.676
- What?
- You are ruining everything.

17:40.744 --> 17:44.336
What? I'm trying to help.
Why are you being so difficult?

17:44.414 --> 17:47.847
Yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that.
Difficult, I'm a difficult seed.

17:47.918 --> 17:50.179
George, I don't have time for this.

17:50.253 --> 17:52.651
Anna, do you want to
talk to George?

17:52.856 --> 17:55.083
- No, I don't think so.
- No, she doesn't want to.

17:55.158 --> 17:58.887
- Okay. Bye, George, we'll see you.
- I'm a bad man.

18:02.332 --> 18:03.831
So where's the tape?

18:03.900 --> 18:06.992
Oh, no, I didn't shoot this one.
I'm just scouting the location.

18:07.370 --> 18:10.735
- I need the tape.
- You'll get your tape.

18:10.807 --> 18:13.467
But here's what I need.
I'm gonna need three cameras...

18:13.543 --> 18:16.510
two on the floor, one in the balcony,
and I want headsets...

18:16.580 --> 18:19.945
for the guys running them.
I want to be able to talk to them.

18:20.283 --> 18:22.374
Are you out of your mind?

18:22.452 --> 18:25.487
- Kramer, l... You know....
- Yeah. I know, Jerry, it's okay.

18:25.555 --> 18:29.113
Yeah, look, Brody,
Jerry wants to do the bootleg.

18:29.192 --> 18:32.784
He's dying to do it, but if you don't
make him happy, the work suffers...

18:32.863 --> 18:35.056
and then nobody's happy.

18:35.498 --> 18:38.863
Just shoot the damn thing
so I can get it out on the street.

18:38.935 --> 18:41.026
All right, that's it.
I can't work like this.

18:41.104 --> 18:42.569
- Jerry...
- I'm off the project.

18:42.639 --> 18:44.036
Jerry!

18:46.309 --> 18:49.242
- I want the tape.
- Yeah, l... I know.

18:51.281 --> 18:53.815
Well, I'm the good boy again.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.212
Can you believe that?

18:55.285 --> 18:58.047
They think they can get anyone
to shoot these bootlegs.

18:58.121 --> 19:00.951
Anna actually has respect
for me now.

19:01.024 --> 19:02.614
It's all over.

19:02.692 --> 19:06.250
The whole business has changed.
It's all about money now.

19:06.329 --> 19:09.023
The sad thing is,
it's the kids that suffer.

19:10.734 --> 19:13.860
Listen, man, you gotta shoot
this movie for me.

19:13.937 --> 19:16.870
Brody, he's a reasonable man,
but he's insane.

19:17.474 --> 19:20.270
I'm not doing this anymore.
I don't know what I was thinking.

19:20.343 --> 19:22.377
It's illegal, it's dangerous....

19:23.179 --> 19:25.110
Did you say dangerous?

19:25.782 --> 19:27.406
I'm a bootlegger.

19:27.484 --> 19:30.212
- You're a what?
- Bootlegging a movie, baby.

19:30.287 --> 19:31.820
Isn't that illegal?

19:31.888 --> 19:35.947
I could do hard time for this one.
And community service.

19:36.393 --> 19:38.017
Is this your FiberCon?

19:41.298 --> 19:43.025
Get out of my way!

19:46.303 --> 19:48.268
Jerry, George got arrested.

19:48.338 --> 19:50.497
- What?
- Yeah. He went down at the Beekman.

19:50.573 --> 19:53.471
He tried to lam,
but they cheesed him.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.606
Oh, now I see.

19:58.081 --> 20:00.445
- Yeah?
- It's Brody. I'm coming up.

20:00.517 --> 20:01.845
What are we gonna do?

20:01.918 --> 20:03.713
Well, I gotta give him something.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.514
Come on. Where's that tape I shot?

20:05.588 --> 20:07.019
I think that's it.

20:07.090 --> 20:09.181
Let's check it out.

20:21.972 --> 20:25.235
Sweet, fancy Moses.

20:25.842 --> 20:27.910
Jerry, she taped over
the whole ending.

20:30.513 --> 20:32.877
- Where's the tape?
- Well, it's...

20:32.949 --> 20:35.415
- Is that it?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.382
Here it is, Brody.

20:37.854 --> 20:40.616
One copy of Cry, Cry Again.

20:41.224 --> 20:43.019
How'd it turn out?

20:43.093 --> 20:44.490
- Great.
- Great, yeah.

20:44.561 --> 20:47.687
Although the whole story
kind of comes apart at the end there.

20:47.764 --> 20:50.833
Out of nowhere there's this lone
dancer who appears to be injured.

20:50.900 --> 20:52.865
Yeah. It's a disturbing image.

20:52.936 --> 20:56.870
Yeah. So you cry,
and then when you see the dancing...

20:56.940 --> 20:58.371
you cry again.

21:04.781 --> 21:07.873
It's all right, George.
You'll just pay a fine, and that'll be it.

21:07.951 --> 21:11.316
Why did the policeman
have to yell at me like that?

21:11.888 --> 21:14.218
- Anna.
- Oh, thanks for coming to pick me up.

21:14.290 --> 21:16.051
- I can explain everything.
- All right.

21:16.126 --> 21:17.955
We'll talk about it at the office.

21:18.028 --> 21:21.427
- Okay, where's my boy?
- Oh, my God.

21:21.865 --> 21:26.231
I'm sitting at home reading
a periodical, and this is the call I get?

21:26.302 --> 21:28.495
My son is a bootlegger?

21:28.605 --> 21:30.172
Ow, Dad!

21:30.640 --> 21:33.174
- Who put you up to this? Was it her?
- All right.

21:33.243 --> 21:35.243
Wait, I think
you've got it backwards.

21:35.311 --> 21:37.902
George isn't clever enough
to hatch a scheme like this.

21:37.981 --> 21:41.642
- You got that right.
- What the hell does that mean?

21:41.718 --> 21:44.582
That means whatever the hell
you want it to mean.

21:44.654 --> 21:46.585
You saying you want a piece of me?

21:48.058 --> 21:51.685
I could drop you like a bag of dirt.

21:52.462 --> 21:54.462
You want a piece of me?

21:54.531 --> 21:55.893
You got it!

22:04.240 --> 22:06.171
But he's an old man, Elaine.

22:06.242 --> 22:09.641
Well, he wrote the check,
and I cashed it.

22:09.712 --> 22:12.246
Look, here's that bootlegged
Death Blow that I shot.

22:12.315 --> 22:15.441
- Cry, Cry Again, I want to see that.
- No, you don't.

22:15.518 --> 22:17.518
- You shot Death Blow?
- Yeah.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.621
- It was brilliant.
- Thank you.

22:19.689 --> 22:21.780
- You were big.
- I'm still big.

22:21.858 --> 22:24.324
It's the bootlegs that got small.

22:24.394 --> 22:27.122
- How are things at the office? Normal?
- Yeah, pretty much.

22:27.197 --> 22:29.629
Although I still get the vibe
every once in a while.

22:29.699 --> 22:31.892
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
