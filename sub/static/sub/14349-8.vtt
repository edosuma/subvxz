WEBVTT

00:07.589 --> 00:10.625
Earth-style distress signal.
SOS.

00:10.801 --> 00:13.552
I've answered it on all frequencies, sir.
They don't reply.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.962
Not a vessel, a ground source.

00:16.139 --> 00:19.223
The third planet in this solar system,
according to my instruments.

00:22.145 --> 00:25.062
Directly ahead.
Definitely an Earth-style signal.

00:25.231 --> 00:28.565
We're hundreds of light years
from Earth, Mr. Spock.

00:29.235 --> 00:31.228
No colonies or vessels out this far.

00:38.494 --> 00:41.579
Measuring the planet now, captain.
Spheroid-shaped.

00:41.747 --> 00:46.041
Circumference, 24,874 miles.

00:46.210 --> 00:50.255
Mass, 6 times
10-to-the-21 st-power tons.

00:50.589 --> 00:53.923
Mean density, 5.517.

00:54.093 --> 00:56.085
Atmosphere...

00:56.428 --> 00:58.421
...oxygen-nitrogen.

00:58.597 --> 00:59.926
Earth.

01:01.892 --> 01:04.893
Not the Earth. Another Earth.

01:05.312 --> 01:06.937
Another Earth.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

01:18.450 --> 01:22.400
Space, the final frontier.

01:22.621 --> 01:26.155
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

01:26.333 --> 01:31.244
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

01:31.421 --> 01:34.375
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

01:35.300 --> 01:38.799
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

02:12.002 --> 02:15.336
Captain's log, stardate 2713.5:

02:15.506 --> 02:17.166
In the distant reaches of our galaxy,

02:17.341 --> 02:19.168
we have made
an astonishing discovery:

02:19.343 --> 02:22.094
Earth-type radio signals
coming from a planet

02:22.262 --> 02:25.180
which apparently
is an exact duplicate of the Earth.

02:25.349 --> 02:28.599
It seems impossible,
but there it is.

02:28.769 --> 02:31.260
- Hold us in a fixed orbit, Mr. Spock.
- Affirmative, captain.

02:31.438 --> 02:34.558
- Still no response, communications?
- None, captain.

02:35.275 --> 02:37.896
We'll beam down. Alert security.

02:38.069 --> 02:40.774
Prepare to transport landing party
to surface.

02:40.947 --> 02:44.814
We'll land in the vicinity of the
distress signal now being received.

03:16.899 --> 03:18.642
Identical.

03:18.817 --> 03:22.400
Earth, as it was
in the early 1900s.

03:22.571 --> 03:27.910
More the mid-1900s, I would say,
captain, approximately 1960.

03:28.076 --> 03:29.820
But where is everybody?

03:29.995 --> 03:33.162
Readings indicate that natural
deterioration has been taking place

03:33.332 --> 03:35.408
on this planet for at least
several centuries.

03:35.584 --> 03:39.249
- You mean there's no one alive?
- Not conclusive, Yeoman.

03:39.421 --> 03:43.750
The evidence would suggest
that the distress signal is automated.

03:46.928 --> 03:48.802
You know, this is marvellous.

03:48.972 --> 03:52.839
The most horrible conglomeration
of antique architecture I've ever seen.

04:07.073 --> 04:08.864
Mr. Spock.

04:33.390 --> 04:34.671
Mine!

04:37.978 --> 04:39.638
It's mine!

04:40.731 --> 04:43.981
It's mine! It's mine!

04:47.654 --> 04:51.486
Mine! Mine! It's mine!

05:11.803 --> 05:13.961
It's broke.

05:14.806 --> 05:18.506
Somebody broke it.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.679
Fix.

05:22.688 --> 05:25.938
Somebody, please fix.

05:26.484 --> 05:28.690
Of course somebody will fix it.

05:28.861 --> 05:31.696
Definitely humanoid,
in spite of the distortion.

05:31.864 --> 05:33.691
But with the mind of a child.

05:40.998 --> 05:43.868
- Bones, what is it?
- A seizure of some type.

05:50.549 --> 05:54.083
- We wanna help you.
- Liar!

05:54.970 --> 05:57.543
Fibber, fibber.

05:57.722 --> 05:59.466
Fibber, fibber!

05:59.641 --> 06:01.515
Fibber! Fibber!
Fibber! Fibber!

06:02.477 --> 06:04.600
Fibber! Fibber!

06:16.783 --> 06:18.526
It's dead.

06:19.619 --> 06:22.536
- It's incredible.
- What is?

06:22.705 --> 06:24.911
Its metabolic rate.

06:25.082 --> 06:27.834
It's impossibly high,
as if it's burning itself up.

06:28.002 --> 06:33.043
Almost as if it aged a century
in just the past few minutes.

06:37.595 --> 06:39.053
Come on!

07:20.762 --> 07:24.261
- How old is this thing?
- About 300 years.

07:33.608 --> 07:35.150
Come out.

07:35.818 --> 07:37.775
We mean you no harm.

07:47.371 --> 07:49.280
Don't hurt me, please.

07:49.999 --> 07:51.991
I'm not gonna hurt you.

07:52.251 --> 07:54.078
No, please, don't.
I didn't do anything.

07:54.253 --> 07:55.996
- I won't hurt you.
- No, please, don't.

07:56.171 --> 07:58.413
- I only want to talk to you.
- No, don't, don't hurt...

07:58.590 --> 08:00.464
- Come on.
- No. Don't, please.

08:00.634 --> 08:02.461
- I won't hurt you. Come on.
- Don't hurt me.

08:02.636 --> 08:03.964
- Don't...
- It's all right.

08:04.137 --> 08:05.169
- No...
- Come here.

08:05.347 --> 08:08.680
We won't hurt you, sweetheart.
We're your friends. No.

08:11.061 --> 08:12.555
Take the guards,
have a look outside.

08:12.729 --> 08:15.516
Radioactive readings, chemical
pollutions, any further sign of life.

08:15.690 --> 08:17.315
Right, captain.

08:21.529 --> 08:25.859
I wonder what happened to her
that she should be so terrified of us.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.736
But I remember the things
you "grups" did.

09:06.907 --> 09:10.027
Burning and yelling, hurting people.

09:10.202 --> 09:12.408
We didn't do anything like that.

09:13.455 --> 09:15.364
You're not going to hurt?

09:15.540 --> 09:17.580
No, of course not.

09:17.918 --> 09:19.709
We're here to help.

09:20.545 --> 09:22.538
Grups don't help.

09:22.714 --> 09:24.588
But we will.

09:25.592 --> 09:27.383
What happened here?

09:27.552 --> 09:29.509
Where is everybody?

09:30.597 --> 09:32.424
You know.

09:32.807 --> 09:34.551
No, I don't.

09:34.726 --> 09:36.600
Won't you tell me?

09:37.145 --> 09:40.929
You got a "foolie," is that it?
And you want me to play, but I can't.

09:41.232 --> 09:43.640
I don't know the rules.
I've got to know the rules.

09:43.818 --> 09:47.436
- Foolie?
- A game, you know.

09:47.613 --> 09:50.069
You can't play a game without rules.

09:50.283 --> 09:52.738
Even grups ought to know that.

09:52.952 --> 09:56.451
- What are grups?
- You are.

09:57.707 --> 10:00.198
They were when "onlies" get old.

10:01.377 --> 10:03.120
Grown-ups.

10:07.299 --> 10:11.297
You said something
about the grups doing bad things.

10:11.679 --> 10:14.300
Yelling, hurting, burning.

10:14.473 --> 10:17.676
That was when they started
to get sick in the before time.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.058
We hid, then they were gone.

10:20.938 --> 10:22.847
Am I doing all right?

10:23.273 --> 10:24.981
You're doing fine.

10:26.276 --> 10:28.732
You said the grups got sick.

10:29.279 --> 10:31.817
Is that why there aren't
any of them around?

10:31.990 --> 10:33.817
Yes. They died.

10:34.409 --> 10:36.152
But that was after the awful things.

10:38.121 --> 10:41.786
A plague, captain.
That could explain a lot of it.

10:43.918 --> 10:47.963
But what about the children,
the onlies?

10:48.298 --> 10:50.124
Didn't the awful things affect them?

10:50.300 --> 10:52.339
Of course not. We're here, aren't we?

10:52.510 --> 10:56.294
- More of you? How many?
- All there are.

11:14.365 --> 11:15.942
What's your name?

11:16.659 --> 11:18.201
Miri.

11:18.369 --> 11:20.029
Miri.

11:21.121 --> 11:22.865
Pretty name...

11:24.374 --> 11:26.533
...for a pretty young woman.

11:30.714 --> 11:32.541
Pretty?

11:34.718 --> 11:36.129
Very pretty.

12:10.962 --> 12:12.753
Guards!

12:24.058 --> 12:25.600
Cover me.

13:19.654 --> 13:22.026
Children, captain. Lots of them.

13:22.198 --> 13:25.946
We couldn't begin to get close to them.
They just seemed to scurry away.

13:26.118 --> 13:31.279
- Like animals, only children.
- Miri said all the adults died.

13:31.457 --> 13:35.241
That creature which attacked us
was certainly no child.

13:35.419 --> 13:39.084
Perhaps it died of the disease
the girl's talking about.

13:39.590 --> 13:41.915
There must be records somewhere.

13:42.092 --> 13:45.212
And answers
to some of our questions.

13:46.513 --> 13:48.007
Miri?

13:48.765 --> 13:52.845
Do you know any buildings
where the doctors used to work?

13:53.020 --> 13:56.186
Yes, I know that.
Them and their pills and things.

13:56.356 --> 13:58.812
- Will you take me there?
- That's a bad place.

13:59.109 --> 14:00.852
It's important.

14:02.779 --> 14:05.352
- Please.
- All right.

14:09.869 --> 14:11.992
Do you have a name too?

14:12.163 --> 14:15.947
- Yes. It's Jim.
- I like that name.

14:16.292 --> 14:17.751
Good.

14:17.919 --> 14:20.042
I like yours too.

14:20.213 --> 14:21.956
I like you.

14:23.174 --> 14:24.716
Do you really?

14:25.384 --> 14:27.211
I wouldn't lie to you.

14:29.388 --> 14:31.714
I wouldn't lie to you either, Jim.

14:33.267 --> 14:37.680
I remember the grups,
but you're nice. You're different.

14:39.773 --> 14:41.731
Why, thank you.

14:47.406 --> 14:50.407
It's already starting.
I knew it would.

14:51.285 --> 14:53.361
Just like it did with the grups.

14:53.537 --> 14:56.110
It'll spread all over you. You'll yell,
try to hurt everybody,

14:56.290 --> 15:00.121
and then you'll die.
I knew it would, I knew it would.

15:15.433 --> 15:19.645
Captain's log, stardate 2713.6:

15:19.813 --> 15:22.434
The building Miri led us to
also housed

15:22.607 --> 15:24.267
an automatic transmission station,

15:24.442 --> 15:27.147
which sent out the signals
that drew us to this planet.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.359
We also discovered something else:

15:29.530 --> 15:32.982
That the blue splotches characteristic
of the unknown disease

15:33.159 --> 15:38.200
had appeared on each of us,
with the exception of Mr. Spock.

15:38.623 --> 15:40.615
There was a well-equipped
laboratory in the building.

15:40.791 --> 15:43.117
Dr. McCoy took tissue samples
of each of us

15:43.294 --> 15:45.915
in an attempt to isolate
the organism responsible.

15:46.088 --> 15:49.837
A veritable zoo of bacteria.

15:52.136 --> 15:55.587
Beam down a bio-computer
and a portable electronic microscope.

15:55.764 --> 15:57.306
If I'm gonna be dealing
with viruses,

15:57.474 --> 15:59.550
I'm gonna need better equipment
than I have here.

16:00.144 --> 16:03.061
- Yes, doctor. Captain Kirk?
- Yes, lieutenant?

16:03.230 --> 16:05.472
I've got volunteers standing by
ready to help you, sir.

16:06.191 --> 16:08.943
Under no circumstances do I want
anyone to beam down from the ship.

16:09.111 --> 16:11.269
We can't take any chances
with further contamination.

16:11.446 --> 16:14.862
- But, captain, if you become too ill...
- My orders still stand, lieutenant.

16:15.033 --> 16:19.078
You can help by clearing the computer
banks and standing by. Kirk out.

16:22.666 --> 16:24.160
Bones.

16:25.502 --> 16:30.496
Why do you think the symptoms
haven't appeared on Mr. Spock?

16:31.007 --> 16:32.335
I don't know.

16:32.508 --> 16:34.418
Probably the little bugs,
or whatever they are,

16:34.594 --> 16:37.049
have no appetite for green blood.

16:39.265 --> 16:44.176
Being a red-blooded human
obviously has its disadvantages.

16:45.688 --> 16:47.894
Now, there you have
a museum piece, doctor.

16:48.065 --> 16:50.852
Lens-type, manually operated,
light-activated...

16:51.027 --> 16:53.862
Spare me the analysis,
Mr. Spock, please?

16:54.029 --> 16:56.699
It's enough that it works.

17:02.913 --> 17:04.953
It spreads real fast, I know.

17:05.332 --> 17:07.159
When you're old,
it covers you like anything.

17:19.179 --> 17:23.508
"Intermediate experimentation
report project on life...

17:24.684 --> 17:26.973
...prolongation."

17:28.313 --> 17:33.651
"Progress report, genetics section.
Life prolongation project."

17:34.027 --> 17:36.352
So that's what it was.

17:41.367 --> 17:43.574
Life prolongation.

17:43.745 --> 17:46.070
Didn't have much luck, did they?

17:50.668 --> 17:51.948
Captain's log:

17:52.128 --> 17:55.793
Dr. McCoy's bio-computer
and a portable electronic microscope

17:55.965 --> 17:58.088
have been beamed down
from the Enterprise.

17:58.259 --> 18:01.675
They will be used in conjunction
with computer banks onboard ship.

18:01.846 --> 18:03.922
Tubular, with extreme multiplicability.

18:04.098 --> 18:09.009
Appear to have affinity for
nucleic acids. Give me what you have.

18:10.771 --> 18:15.148
- This was 300 years ago, captain.
- All the adults are dead.

18:15.317 --> 18:17.938
Only the children are left alive.

18:18.112 --> 18:20.781
But children become adults.

18:21.114 --> 18:24.281
At least they have up to now.

18:33.835 --> 18:35.377
Doctor...

18:36.463 --> 18:39.748
...there are certain glandular changes
which take place

18:39.924 --> 18:42.878
upon entering puberty,
are there not?

18:43.053 --> 18:46.421
Of course. It changes
the entire body system.

18:46.598 --> 18:48.306
You know that.

18:48.975 --> 18:51.264
Of course you know that. Why?

18:51.436 --> 18:56.098
Is it not possible
that these children here,

18:56.274 --> 18:58.480
as they enter puberty,
contract the disease?

18:59.485 --> 19:02.819
That would explain
why there are no adults.

19:03.906 --> 19:08.485
Glandular, post-pubescent.
It could be.

19:11.247 --> 19:14.580
It's illogical. It does not follow.

19:14.875 --> 19:18.955
All the adults on this planet
died 300 years ago...

19:19.713 --> 19:22.667
...but there are children
in the streets.

19:23.258 --> 19:26.046
Who die when they enter
adolescence.

19:27.179 --> 19:30.429
But how do they keep
their line going?

19:31.683 --> 19:33.475
One thing, captain.

19:33.644 --> 19:37.344
If she were a wild animal
ever since she's been a little girl,

19:37.522 --> 19:39.930
how do you explain that
she wants to stay with us?

19:40.108 --> 19:41.602
Loneliness? I don't know. Curiosity?

19:41.776 --> 19:44.350
I think children have
an instinctive need for adults.

19:44.529 --> 19:47.863
They want to be told
right and wrong.

19:48.992 --> 19:53.155
There may be other emotions
at work in this case, captain.

19:53.371 --> 19:55.494
She likes you, Jim.

19:56.624 --> 19:59.162
She's becoming a woman.

20:11.180 --> 20:12.211
Mr. Spock.

20:14.892 --> 20:18.308
- Spock here.
- Here are those figures you asked for.

20:19.230 --> 20:21.721
Twelve to the tenth power.

20:23.275 --> 20:26.810
Metabolic rate, 72 percent.

20:28.781 --> 20:33.526
Production of nucleic acids
reduced to 33 percent of normal.

20:36.413 --> 20:41.241
Conventional chronological
progression, 100 by 3.6.

20:41.418 --> 20:43.411
Acknowledged, lieutenant.

20:48.925 --> 20:51.333
I have their calculations now.

20:52.345 --> 20:55.797
Try again. See if you can find
anything outside.

20:56.933 --> 20:58.308
Hey.

20:58.935 --> 21:00.809
Clean up that desk for me, will you?

21:00.979 --> 21:03.434
- All right, Jim.
- Thank you.

21:05.942 --> 21:08.563
According to their
life prolongation plan,

21:08.736 --> 21:10.480
what they thought
they were accomplishing,

21:10.655 --> 21:15.198
a person would age only one month
for every 100 years of real time.

21:17.120 --> 21:20.370
One hundred years,
and only one month?

21:21.290 --> 21:23.117
Exactly, Yeoman.

21:23.459 --> 21:26.330
Evidently, through
some miscalculation,

21:26.504 --> 21:29.339
this virus annihilated
the entire adult population

21:29.507 --> 21:32.958
in a very short period,
leaving only the children.

21:33.135 --> 21:35.175
But that means these children...

21:35.346 --> 21:37.671
Could very well be immensely old.

21:37.848 --> 21:39.473
That would certainly
answer the question

21:39.641 --> 21:41.219
of what happened to their parents.

21:41.393 --> 21:45.261
- Answers it very well.
- Children who never age.

21:45.439 --> 21:50.433
Eternal childhood filled with play,
no responsibilities.

21:50.611 --> 21:51.773
It's almost like a dream.

21:51.945 --> 21:54.816
I wouldn't examine that dream
too closely, Yeoman.

21:54.990 --> 21:56.817
It might not turn out
to be very pretty.

21:57.159 --> 22:02.401
A few days ago, or a week ago,
that creature that attacked us

22:02.581 --> 22:04.869
could have been just like Miri.

22:05.500 --> 22:08.667
A child entering puberty
on this planet

22:08.837 --> 22:10.331
means a death sentence.

22:12.841 --> 22:15.082
Do you suppose she knows?

22:17.262 --> 22:18.424
I don't think so.

22:18.680 --> 22:20.304
Well, if they're as old
as Spock claims,

22:20.473 --> 22:22.881
they must have some idea
of what's happening.

22:23.851 --> 22:26.425
There's no adult interpretation.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.897
I think we're dealing with children.
Immensely old, perhaps,

22:30.066 --> 22:31.857
but nonetheless children.

22:32.026 --> 22:33.686
I've gotta do something
about the others.

22:33.861 --> 22:36.530
Difficult, if we can't even
get a glimpse of them.

22:36.697 --> 22:38.820
You couldn't get close
to the other kids?

22:38.991 --> 22:41.482
Impossible.
They know the area too well.

22:41.744 --> 22:43.571
Like mice.

22:44.330 --> 22:46.073
I'm gonna try.

22:49.793 --> 22:50.824
Miri.

22:53.672 --> 22:55.131
Come here.

23:01.555 --> 23:04.721
- You wanna go someplace with me?
- Sure.

23:17.862 --> 23:19.321
That little girl...

23:19.489 --> 23:23.950
Is at least 300 years older
than you are, Yeoman.

23:24.410 --> 23:26.154
Think about it.

23:51.437 --> 23:55.849
But Miri is with them. Why? Why?

23:56.025 --> 23:59.109
- What you gonna do, Jahn?
- I don't... I don't know.

24:00.446 --> 24:02.403
I know what we've gotta do.

24:02.573 --> 24:06.440
There's more of them
than we see. Somewhere.

24:07.786 --> 24:11.618
Up in the sky, maybe. Somewhere.

24:12.499 --> 24:14.954
They talk to each other all the time.

24:15.127 --> 24:17.119
You know grups.
You know what they do.

24:17.295 --> 24:19.252
The hurting, the killing...

24:19.673 --> 24:22.757
- I remember, Jahn, the way it was...
- That's right.

24:22.926 --> 24:25.631
The way it was in the before time.

24:29.641 --> 24:33.140
They talk to the other grups
with these little boxes.

24:36.814 --> 24:39.649
Now, if they didn't have
those little boxes...

24:40.818 --> 24:44.816
...they'd be all alone.

24:45.907 --> 24:48.611
But they don't see us. We hide.

24:49.035 --> 24:53.578
- Ollie, ollie, oxen free
- Ollie, ollie, oxen free

24:53.748 --> 24:56.951
- Ollie, ollie, oxen free
- No!

24:58.002 --> 24:59.745
It's not a game.

25:00.963 --> 25:02.505
It's real.

25:04.258 --> 25:07.212
They're dangerous. They're grups.
Don't you understand?

25:07.386 --> 25:09.046
Jahn.

25:22.859 --> 25:25.860
All right, let's hide.

26:26.004 --> 26:27.498
Dead.

26:28.215 --> 26:31.381
I don't understand it.
My phaser wasn't set to kill.

26:36.097 --> 26:38.304
Her name was Louise.

26:39.392 --> 26:42.429
She was a little bit older than I am
when it happened.

26:44.397 --> 26:46.105
Oh, Jim.

26:55.199 --> 26:58.236
Data has been fed into the computers,
Mr. Spock. Stand by.

26:58.411 --> 27:00.119
Acknowledged.

27:00.746 --> 27:01.945
Are these enough, Jim?

27:02.456 --> 27:04.283
We could use some more,
if you don't mind.

27:05.376 --> 27:06.455
No, I don't mind.

27:16.887 --> 27:20.339
There couldn't be any doubt
about what you've found here?

27:21.517 --> 27:26.344
This fellow made these notes in the
last weeks, after the disaster began.

27:27.481 --> 27:32.606
I disregard these last entries.
He said himself he was too sick,

27:32.778 --> 27:36.775
too far gone to be sure
he wasn't already mad, and I agree.

27:36.948 --> 27:40.033
But based on the entries
he made before that,

27:40.202 --> 27:42.871
I know how much time we have.

27:43.038 --> 27:45.326
The ship's computers
will verify my figures.

27:45.498 --> 27:48.950
Only a matter of time
before we all go mad,

27:49.127 --> 27:54.287
destroy each other, till the last of us
finally destroys himself.

28:08.438 --> 28:10.229
What about Miri?

28:10.940 --> 28:14.688
Our guess was correct. They contract
the disease as they enter puberty

28:14.860 --> 28:17.482
and their metabolism changes.
The notes would indicate

28:17.655 --> 28:20.360
that it doesn't become acute
for a month or so.

28:20.533 --> 28:24.993
I estimate she has perhaps
five or six weeks left.

28:25.287 --> 28:26.366
What about us?

28:26.539 --> 28:30.999
The older the victim, the more rapid
the progress of the disease.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.832
And you?

28:36.006 --> 28:37.999
The disease doesn't seem
to be interested in you.

28:38.175 --> 28:42.007
I am a carrier. Whatever happens,
I can't go back to the ship.

28:43.388 --> 28:46.389
And I do want to go back
to the ship, captain.

28:48.935 --> 28:50.477
Of course, Mr. Spock.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.227
We still don't know
what we're fighting.

28:56.401 --> 29:00.019
No, but we know what it is,
and how fast it does it.

29:00.321 --> 29:03.572
It's progressing.
We'll begin to feel it inside soon.

29:03.741 --> 29:07.525
Intense fever, great pain
in the extremities,

29:07.704 --> 29:08.902
fuzziness of vision.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.413
Of course, those are the early
symptoms. There'll be more.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.711
Are you certain about the time
we have left?

29:17.880 --> 29:20.087
I presume my calculations
are correct.

29:20.258 --> 29:23.342
- Is there any possibility..?
- Landing party, this is the Enterprise.

29:23.844 --> 29:24.876
Spock here.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.723
Computer indicates 170 hours,
Mr. Spock.

29:28.974 --> 29:33.054
Verified, captain.
We have seven days.

29:44.281 --> 29:46.439
Captain's log, supplement:

29:46.617 --> 29:50.484
It is the second day of the seven
left to us. We've found nothing.

29:50.662 --> 29:55.454
Enterprise is standing by with its labs,
computers, ready to assist us,

29:55.959 --> 30:00.087
but there is no data,
no starting point.

30:00.589 --> 30:02.581
I think I've found it.

30:03.133 --> 30:07.296
- Janice, take Miri for a walk.
- Yes, sir.

30:08.805 --> 30:10.133
Only one half intact.

30:10.306 --> 30:11.966
But do you know
what they were up to?

30:12.142 --> 30:13.600
More or less.

30:13.768 --> 30:16.686
The idea was to create
a new series of diseases,

30:16.854 --> 30:20.188
a chain reaction of viruses meant
essentially to extend the life

30:20.358 --> 30:22.149
of the human cell immeasurably.

30:22.318 --> 30:26.019
Unfortunately, they weren't successful.
We've seen the results.

30:29.909 --> 30:35.152
You two will have to re-create their
thinking. If you can isolate that virus,

30:35.331 --> 30:37.822
you'll be able to develop
a vaccine.

30:40.503 --> 30:43.918
Is that all, captain?
We have five days, you know.

30:44.673 --> 30:46.333
I know.

30:48.385 --> 30:49.963
Children.

31:23.169 --> 31:25.921
- Anything? You?
- No. Nothing.

31:48.527 --> 31:50.484
The communicators, captain.

31:54.158 --> 31:55.189
They're gone.

31:55.367 --> 31:57.526
Jim, we've absolutely gotta have
those communicators.

31:57.703 --> 31:59.197
Without them,
we don't have computers.

31:59.371 --> 32:02.040
And without the computers,
we don't have a chance.

32:08.714 --> 32:12.462
Captain's log, stardate 2717.3:

32:12.634 --> 32:15.505
Three days, seven hours left to us.

32:15.679 --> 32:18.549
Investigation proves that
the supply of food left in the area

32:18.723 --> 32:21.297
is running dangerously low.
Unless something is done,

32:21.476 --> 32:23.599
the children will starve
in a few months.

32:23.770 --> 32:25.893
In addition, the disease
is working on each of us

32:26.064 --> 32:29.848
according to Dr. McCoy's prediction.
Our tempers are growing short,

32:30.026 --> 32:32.564
and we are no further along
than we were two days ago.

32:32.737 --> 32:36.438
- Haven't you found a thing yet?
- Would you like to take a crack at it?

32:52.089 --> 32:55.790
No! No! No!

32:59.180 --> 33:00.971
No!

33:13.652 --> 33:16.523
I'm upset, captain. So upset.

33:23.745 --> 33:28.621
Back on the ship, I used to try
to get you to look at my legs.

33:33.171 --> 33:35.128
Captain...

33:36.341 --> 33:38.250
...look at my legs.

34:03.034 --> 34:06.200
We're all frightened.

34:13.210 --> 34:15.748
Jim, I found something.

34:23.594 --> 34:26.466
The last slide I examined, I failed
to make the necessary adjustment

34:26.639 --> 34:28.965
- for the slowing down...
- Never mind. What did you find?

34:29.141 --> 34:32.226
The disease, captain. The one
they created 300 years ago.

34:32.395 --> 34:34.721
- There's a chance!
- A chance.

34:34.898 --> 34:36.226
At least it's a race now.

34:37.317 --> 34:39.855
And we've just wasted a minute.

34:57.170 --> 35:00.752
I'll admit it would be some foolie,
Miri, but do you think it'd work?

35:00.923 --> 35:03.794
I know, I know.

35:03.968 --> 35:06.007
Don't you think
I've heard them talk?

35:06.178 --> 35:09.678
They have such little time to do
this dumb thing of theirs,

35:09.849 --> 35:11.094
this "buttinsky" thing.

35:11.267 --> 35:15.134
And if we get her away,
that Yeoman,

35:15.312 --> 35:17.982
that's one person less
to start off with.

35:18.148 --> 35:20.141
But how, Miri? If they're so busy,

35:20.317 --> 35:22.061
if they're gonna have
the big emergency,

35:22.236 --> 35:25.652
- how are you gonna get her away?
- It's easy.

35:25.823 --> 35:29.192
She's always asking me about the
youngest little onlies, the little ones.

35:29.368 --> 35:31.610
"What if they get sick?
Who takes care of them?

35:31.787 --> 35:34.788
Do they have enough to eat?
Where do they sleep?"

35:34.957 --> 35:38.740
I'll just tell her one of you
fell down and got hurt.

35:38.919 --> 35:41.410
- Me, say it's me.
- All right, you.

35:41.588 --> 35:45.004
But grups, they know things
and all that.

35:45.175 --> 35:49.125
You know, I bet they'll be able
to do it with one person less.

35:49.429 --> 35:51.422
Not one.

35:51.681 --> 35:52.962
Two.

35:53.141 --> 35:54.884
Because he'll try to find her.

35:55.059 --> 35:56.933
Who? Who will, Miri?

35:58.980 --> 36:00.771
The captain.

36:01.399 --> 36:03.771
He'll try to find her, but he won't.

36:05.403 --> 36:08.108
- Mr. Lovey-dovey.
- Lovey-dovey.

36:08.489 --> 36:12.653
Bonk, bonk on the head.
Bonk, bonk! Bonk, bonk!

36:12.827 --> 36:16.907
Bonk, bonk! Bonk, bonk!
Bonk, bonk!

36:17.081 --> 36:21.909
Bonk, bonk! Bonk, bonk!
Bonk, bonk! Bonk, bonk!

36:22.086 --> 36:27.839
Bonk, bonk! Bonk, bonk!
Bonk, bonk! Bonk, bonk!

36:33.180 --> 36:37.427
- It looks right.
- The nitrogen cycle? It has to be.

36:37.601 --> 36:39.392
Yeah, but the question is:

36:39.561 --> 36:41.470
What's the dosage?

36:42.356 --> 36:44.644
That is a very good question.

36:44.816 --> 36:47.188
Where is she, Miri? Where is she,
Miri? Where is Janice?

36:47.361 --> 36:49.934
What's the matter with you?
How should I know?

36:51.865 --> 36:53.988
Where is she?

36:56.161 --> 36:59.327
- Has something happened to her?
- Don't you feel all right?

36:59.497 --> 37:03.875
No, I don't feel all right!
None of us feel all right!

37:04.043 --> 37:06.451
Can't you see what's going on?

37:06.629 --> 37:09.381
Jim, I don't want anything
to happen to you.

37:15.221 --> 37:17.344
- I've gotta find Janice.
- That's not all, captain.

37:17.515 --> 37:19.223
We've got to find
those communicators.

37:19.392 --> 37:21.183
We're trying, Mr. Spock.
We're trying hard.

37:21.352 --> 37:23.012
That's not good enough!

37:23.187 --> 37:27.600
This could be it, but we can't test it
without the ship's computers.

37:28.067 --> 37:30.558
We've got to have
those communicators, Jim.

37:30.820 --> 37:32.812
This is the vaccine?

37:33.739 --> 37:35.482
That's what the computers
will tell us.

37:37.201 --> 37:41.412
Without them, it could be
a beaker full of death.

37:51.840 --> 37:53.583
Did you hear them?

37:55.010 --> 37:58.710
- We only have a few hours left.
- I don't care.

38:00.098 --> 38:02.091
You've got to care.

38:05.395 --> 38:06.937
Miri.

38:08.356 --> 38:10.563
I'm gonna tell you something.

38:14.654 --> 38:16.445
You...

38:16.614 --> 38:20.991
...your friends, all the onlies,
are gonna get the disease

38:21.160 --> 38:24.743
unless we succeed in what we're
doing. You've seen your friends get it.

38:24.914 --> 38:28.959
- Sometimes it happens...
- Not sometimes, all the times, Miri!

38:29.627 --> 38:34.170
As soon as you start growing up,
the way you are.

38:37.134 --> 38:43.504
Don't you know why you don't like
to play games anymore?

38:44.308 --> 38:47.178
Why you don't see your friends
the way you used to?

38:49.647 --> 38:52.731
It's because you're becoming
a young woman.

38:53.942 --> 38:55.187
And...

38:56.195 --> 38:59.694
...the moment you become a young
woman, you get the disease, all of you.

38:59.865 --> 39:01.608
That's not true.
It just happens sometimes.

39:01.783 --> 39:03.906
All the time, Miri!

39:04.077 --> 39:06.912
It's happening to you right now!

39:07.831 --> 39:09.954
Look at it. Look at it, Miri!
It's in you!

39:10.125 --> 39:11.619
- No!
- Look at it!

39:11.793 --> 39:15.162
No! No!

39:24.055 --> 39:29.013
No, you got the wrong game.
A teacher, I told you.

39:29.185 --> 39:31.427
Now what does a teacher say, huh?

39:32.897 --> 39:34.688
Yeah.

39:35.942 --> 39:40.936
Study, study, study!
Or bonk, bonk, bad kid.

39:48.746 --> 39:51.153
- It's not funny.
- It's a foolie.

39:51.332 --> 39:53.408
What are you gonna do with me?

39:53.876 --> 39:56.034
You think I'd tell you?

40:00.966 --> 40:02.377
Miri.

40:03.469 --> 40:06.505
- You're not supposed to be here.
- I know.

40:06.680 --> 40:08.222
What's the matter?
Something go wrong?

40:08.557 --> 40:10.715
- No.
- Okay, then.

40:10.892 --> 40:13.846
Just don't stand there
in the doorway. Come on in.

40:21.528 --> 40:24.233
- Listen to him.
- You listen, Miri!

40:24.406 --> 40:27.406
I did. Why do you think
I brought him here?

40:27.575 --> 40:29.864
- Tell them, Jim.
- "Tell them, Jim."

40:30.078 --> 40:32.320
- Tell them, Jim.
- Tell them, Jim!

40:32.497 --> 40:36.744
Tell them, Jim! Tell them, Jim!
Tell them, Jim! Tell them, Jim!

40:36.918 --> 40:41.745
Tell them, Jim! Tell them, Jim!
Tell them, Jim! Tell them, Jim!

40:41.923 --> 40:46.750
Tell them, Jim! Tell them, Jim!
Tell them, Jim! Tell them, Jim!

40:46.928 --> 40:50.510
- Tell them, Jim! Tell them, Jim!
- Listen to me.

40:50.681 --> 40:52.923
- Listen to me!
- Yelling in the classroom.

40:53.100 --> 40:55.770
Look at him. A very bad citizen.

40:55.936 --> 40:59.103
This isn't a game.
There never was a game.

40:59.273 --> 41:01.312
- Call the police!
- I'm the police!

41:01.483 --> 41:04.153
- Bonk, bonk, unless you're good.
- You're the teacher!

41:04.320 --> 41:07.854
I got two jobs! Bonk, bonk!

41:13.620 --> 41:17.784
Listen to me!
You've got our communicators...

41:18.417 --> 41:20.374
...the boxes we talk into.

41:20.544 --> 41:22.287
We need them to talk to the ship.

41:25.632 --> 41:28.301
No "blah, blah, blah!"

41:29.678 --> 41:33.212
Because if we don't talk
to the ship...

41:34.057 --> 41:35.966
...if you don't help us...

41:37.394 --> 41:39.766
...there won't be any games anymore.

41:40.980 --> 41:42.973
There won't be anything.

41:44.651 --> 41:46.311
Nothing.

41:46.486 --> 41:49.155
No grups, no onlies.

41:49.322 --> 41:51.279
Nobody left...

41:53.159 --> 41:55.317
...forever and ever.

41:59.832 --> 42:01.207
Captain!

42:07.590 --> 42:09.381
Now listen to me.

42:09.550 --> 42:12.504
You've got to help us
before it's too late.

42:12.720 --> 42:16.967
Let Janice go. Give me those
communicators before it's too late!

42:34.908 --> 42:39.949
You've seen your friends change
one by one as they grew up.

42:40.121 --> 42:42.363
Did you ever see
one of them not change?

42:42.540 --> 42:46.620
One by one, they got the disease,
and they became like...

42:46.795 --> 42:50.128
Like... Like those creatures
you're afraid of, like Louise.

42:50.298 --> 42:52.374
One by one, they changed
and got the disease.

42:52.550 --> 42:54.792
The disease, like I've got,
like Miri has.

42:54.969 --> 42:56.843
You understand
what I'm talking about.

42:57.013 --> 42:59.586
You're not babies. We can help you.

42:59.766 --> 43:03.134
Naughty grup! Bonk, bonk!

43:03.311 --> 43:05.884
- Bonk, bonk!
- No! Please! No!

43:16.782 --> 43:20.032
It's waiting for you.
Maybe only a matter of months.

43:20.202 --> 43:22.907
Listen to him. He's telling the truth.

43:23.539 --> 43:27.667
- He's funny. He thinks he's funny.
- Bonk, bonk! Hit him!

43:27.835 --> 43:29.827
Look at my arms!

43:30.420 --> 43:32.662
That's what's gonna happen to you...

43:33.340 --> 43:36.756
...unless you let me help you.
- Bonk, bonk! Hit him!

43:36.927 --> 43:39.762
- Bonk, bonk!
- And the little ones...

43:42.432 --> 43:44.757
What's gonna happen to them
after you've gone...

43:45.352 --> 43:48.970
...after you've turned into creatures
like Louise? Oh, they'll still be here.

43:49.147 --> 43:53.061
But not for long, because the food's
all gone. You've eaten it.

43:53.234 --> 43:58.608
Maybe six months left. That's all.
And then nothing left to eat.

43:59.616 --> 44:03.198
Nobody left to take care of them.
They'll die too.

44:03.369 --> 44:07.153
Look at my arm, Jahn. It's happening
to me. He's telling the truth.

44:07.331 --> 44:10.119
- They're grups!
- Bonk, bonk!

44:10.293 --> 44:14.337
Bonk, bonk! Bonk, bonk!
Bonk, bonk! Bonk, bonk!

44:14.505 --> 44:16.414
- Bonk, bonk!
- All right, you want a foolie?

44:16.591 --> 44:19.675
All right. I dare you.

44:21.762 --> 44:23.422
I double dare you.

44:25.432 --> 44:27.591
Look at the blood on my face.
Now look at your hands.

44:27.768 --> 44:29.725
Blood on your hands.

44:29.895 --> 44:31.639
Now who's doing the hurting?

44:31.814 --> 44:36.107
Not the grups. It's you hurting, yelling,
maybe killing.

44:36.276 --> 44:39.147
Just like the grups you remember,
and the creatures you're afraid of.

44:39.321 --> 44:43.615
You're acting like them,
and you're gonna be just like them

44:43.784 --> 44:46.275
unless you let me help you.

44:46.828 --> 44:48.453
I'm a grup...

44:50.457 --> 44:53.126
...and I want to help you.

44:53.585 --> 44:56.669
I'm begging you, let me help you.

44:57.505 --> 44:59.996
Or there won't be anything left at all.

45:03.094 --> 45:04.470
Please.

45:09.517 --> 45:11.806
We can't wait for those
communicators any longer.

45:11.978 --> 45:16.355
- We must. The vaccine could be fatal.
- The disease certainly is.

45:16.524 --> 45:19.395
How long do we have left?
Hours? Minutes?

45:19.569 --> 45:22.320
How much longer
do you wanna wait?

45:24.865 --> 45:28.945
Bickering is pointless. I'll check
on the captain's progress.

46:15.748 --> 46:17.907
Spock!

46:36.435 --> 46:40.136
- Is he dead, Mr. Spock?
- Not yet.

46:48.948 --> 46:51.070
Three hours, 11 minutes left.
Thank you, lieutenant.

46:51.241 --> 46:53.946
Keep this channel open.
Clear your computers.

47:03.420 --> 47:06.089
- What happened to McCoy?
- He injected himself with the vaccine.

47:06.256 --> 47:08.628
He was unconscious
when I found him.

47:12.470 --> 47:14.262
Look at his face.

47:19.769 --> 47:22.094
The blemishes are fading.

47:24.774 --> 47:26.482
They're fading.

47:55.971 --> 47:58.676
I never will understand
the medical mind.

48:11.445 --> 48:14.232
Is this supposed to be
a good thing, Miri?

48:15.532 --> 48:17.359
Of course it is.

48:27.544 --> 48:29.620
But they were just children.

48:29.796 --> 48:32.501
- To leave them with a medical team...
- Just children.

48:32.674 --> 48:34.631
Three hundred years old and more.

48:34.801 --> 48:38.549
I've already contacted Space Central.
They'll send teachers, advisers.

48:38.721 --> 48:41.212
- And truant officers, I presume.
- They'll be all right.

48:42.725 --> 48:47.054
Miri...
She really loved you, you know.

48:49.023 --> 48:50.565
Yes.

48:52.860 --> 48:55.481
I never get involved
with older women, Yeoman.

49:01.410 --> 49:03.652
- Mr. Spock?
- Captain?

49:04.121 --> 49:08.534
- Full ahead, warp factor 1.
- Warp factor 1, captain.
