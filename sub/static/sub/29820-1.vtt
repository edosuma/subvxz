37:24.580 --> 37:27.750
-I am acting dangerous!
-Oh, my goodness!

37:27.830 --> 37:30.000
-Easy, easy.
-And contagious!

37:30.080 --> 37:32.880
And sometimes, it's even a little more
subtle than that.

37:32.960 --> 37:36.050
-Rabies! Rabies! Rabies!
-And sometimes, it's not.

37:36.130 --> 37:37.220
(YELLING)

37:37.300 --> 37:40.220
-She's got it bad, doesn't she?
-Look out! She's headed for your stash!

37:40.300 --> 37:42.550
-I am?
-Yes, you are.

37:42.640 --> 37:46.890
Oh, right! Yes, I am!
I'm getting rabies everywhere! (GROWLING)

37:46.980 --> 37:48.520
Even the sausages?

37:48.600 --> 37:49.850
Oh, yeah!

37:49.940 --> 37:52.270
-ALLEY DOG: What?
-Yes, especially on the sausages.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.690
-These are rabies sausages now.
-What do we do?

37:54.770 --> 37:56.110
Quick, run! Save yourself!

37:56.190 --> 37:57.360
What about my sausages?

37:57.440 --> 37:59.200
-Just go! Just leave it!
-(GROWLING)

37:59.280 --> 38:01.780
-Here she comes!
-Wait, stop! I think she's got me!

38:01.860 --> 38:04.370
-ALLEY DOG: Sorry, you're on your own.
-(TRAMP LAUGHS)

38:04.450 --> 38:06.620
Wow. (CHUCKLES) I feel alive.

38:06.700 --> 38:07.790
(TRAMP GROANS)

38:07.870 --> 38:09.330
Rabies! (CHUCKLES)

38:09.410 --> 38:13.210
Wait, I seem to remember
you calling me a street dog,

38:13.290 --> 38:15.960
but here you are out on the streets.

38:16.050 --> 38:20.340
Strange. Let me guess,
baby moves in, dog moves out?

38:20.430 --> 38:22.300
No, not at all!

38:22.390 --> 38:24.220
This here...
This is not what it looks like.

38:24.470 --> 38:27.720
Uh-huh. You're welcome
for saving your life, by the way.

38:27.810 --> 38:31.640
And in exchange, I got you a free meal.
So, I think we're even.

38:31.730 --> 38:34.150
That's the craziest "thank you"
I've ever gotten.

38:34.230 --> 38:35.440
Maybe you do have rabies.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.860
Hilarious. Okay, well,
seeing as I'm the reason

38:37.940 --> 38:41.360
that you got that garbage,
help me get this thing off my face.

38:41.450 --> 38:44.820
(SCOFFS) Fine. I'll see what I can do.

38:44.910 --> 38:46.740
I think I got a friend who can help.

38:46.830 --> 38:49.000
Now, he's a little stiff.
Kinda reminds me of you.

38:49.080 --> 38:51.000
LADY: I'm already regretting this.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.380
This is your friend?

38:58.460 --> 39:02.180
Please. Don't be ridiculous.
This is my friend.

39:02.260 --> 39:04.550
-LADY: Of course it is.
-Come on.

39:04.640 --> 39:07.060
You just need to hook that wire
onto his teeth.

39:07.140 --> 39:10.350
-Is your plan for him to bite it off?
-Would you just do it?

39:10.430 --> 39:12.390
Like this?

39:12.480 --> 39:15.940
-This doesn't feel like progress.
-Do you want me to help you or not?

39:16.020 --> 39:17.980
Just lean back
so this thing doesn't move...

39:18.070 --> 39:19.070
Just make it quick.

39:19.150 --> 39:20.990
...while I work this thing loose.
What is this?

39:21.070 --> 39:24.280
-That's my ear, please.
-What? Could you stop moving so much?

39:24.660 --> 39:27.450
-Ow. You stepped on my paw.
-Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to.

39:27.530 --> 39:29.830
-(TRAMP GRUNTS)
-This is not awkward at all.

39:29.910 --> 39:33.500
On my count, we're both gonna need to pull
as hard as we can. You ready?

39:33.580 --> 39:35.040
-LADY: Yeah.
-One... (GRUNTS)

39:35.120 --> 39:36.960
-Two.
-My count.

39:37.040 --> 39:39.460
-LADY: Okay.
-Two... Three.

39:39.550 --> 39:41.260
(BOTH GRUNT)

39:43.680 --> 39:45.050
(BOTH SIGH)

-(LADY GASPS)
-TRAMP: Oh.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

39:52.020 --> 39:53.060
(TRAMP EXHALES)

39:53.140 --> 39:56.480
-Told you it would work.
-Yep. Well, thanks for your help.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.940
-Thank you. I mean, yeah, you're welcome.
-Yeah... Thank you, too.

40:00.020 --> 40:03.070
Have fun at home, baby.
I mean, with the baby.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.200
What?

40:04.280 --> 40:06.320
No, uh... Never mind.

40:06.990 --> 40:08.990
Well, this is goodbye, I think.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.700
-Yep.
-Bye.

40:10.790 --> 40:12.040
TRAMP: Bye.

40:16.330 --> 40:18.130
WOMAN: I'm thinking about
getting one for us.

40:18.210 --> 40:19.290
MAN: Maybe tomorrow?

40:19.380 --> 40:20.550
WOMAN: Yes, why not?

40:20.630 --> 40:22.670
(CLEARS THROAT)
You, um... You look lost.

40:22.760 --> 40:26.970
I think I am capable of finding
my own way home, thank you very much.

40:27.050 --> 40:28.300
Oh, okay.

40:30.180 --> 40:33.060
I guess I won't bother telling you
that's the, uh, wrong way.

40:33.140 --> 40:35.640
I mean, if you're going home,
that would be the wrong way.

40:35.730 --> 40:38.310
No, I know. I just wanted to see
what was over there.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.820
-Now, I'm going home.
-Okay.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.610
That's also the completely wrong way.

40:44.690 --> 40:47.160
(GROANS) Okay, yes, I am lost.

40:47.240 --> 40:50.830
So, you just gonna stand there and mock me
or are you gonna help me out?

40:50.910 --> 40:53.080
Is that an either or question?
Because ideally...

40:53.160 --> 40:55.000
Just point. I'll be on my way, okay?

40:55.080 --> 40:57.170
It's that way. Now, listen,
this isn't a backyard.

40:57.250 --> 40:59.790
There are rules. Lesson one.
Always look both ways.

40:59.880 --> 41:01.090
-Catch up!
-Lesson two.

41:01.170 --> 41:03.460
-Cars are heavy and they hurt!
-(HORN BLARES)

41:15.180 --> 41:16.770
Don't you know any shortcuts?

41:16.850 --> 41:18.350
We're taking the scenic route.

41:18.440 --> 41:20.150
I would like to get home eventually.

41:20.230 --> 41:21.650
Why do you even want to go home?

41:21.730 --> 41:22.730
I told you.

41:22.820 --> 41:25.230
-This is just one big misunderstanding.
-Mm-hmm.

41:25.320 --> 41:28.360
Jim Dear and Darling must be worried sick
about me by now.

41:28.450 --> 41:29.820
Uh-huh. Yeah, no, sure.

41:29.910 --> 41:31.240
What is that look?

41:31.320 --> 41:32.780
Look, I hate to break it to you,

41:32.870 --> 41:35.080
I'm just not seeing
a lot of "lost dog" posters up...

41:35.160 --> 41:38.710
You may think that you know people,
but you don't know my people, okay?

41:38.790 --> 41:41.130
They would never let me
wind up on the streets.

41:41.210 --> 41:42.420
Not on purpose.

41:43.170 --> 41:44.710
Okay, fair enough.

41:45.260 --> 41:48.010
But you're walking around on the street.
You have no collar.

41:48.090 --> 41:51.470
You are off leash.
You smell a tweensy bit like trash.

41:51.550 --> 41:54.390
-Rude.
-Which means, to that dog catcher...

41:54.470 --> 41:55.970
ELLIOTT: I'm looking for a street dog.

41:56.060 --> 41:59.020
-(LADY GASPS)
-Really scruffy face. Unpredictable.

41:59.100 --> 42:03.860
You're a street dog, so that's why
we're sticking to the scenic route.

42:03.940 --> 42:05.820
Come on. You might even have fun.

42:06.320 --> 42:07.570
Floppy ears?

42:08.070 --> 42:09.990
-That's the one.
-Yeah, I know that dog.

42:10.070 --> 42:12.070
-That dog's a menace.
-Yes.

42:12.160 --> 42:13.870
Sleeps in my train yard.

42:15.870 --> 42:17.620
-Show me.
-Come on.

42:20.540 --> 42:23.590
-(BOAT HORN TOOTS)
-MAN: Go ahead and just stow it all away.

42:28.210 --> 42:30.130
Come on! We gotta get across the river.

42:30.220 --> 42:31.220
On that?

42:31.300 --> 42:33.180
Have you never been on a boat before?

42:33.260 --> 42:37.930
I've never seen a boat before.
How are we supposed to get on?

42:38.020 --> 42:39.680
Come on, follow me!

42:44.020 --> 42:45.980
Here. Just a quick little jump.

42:46.070 --> 42:47.400
LADY: No way.

42:47.480 --> 42:49.990
Oh, come on, it's easy. I'll show you.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.870
(GRUNTS) Ow! Ow!

42:53.950 --> 42:56.530
Yeah, it's totally safe.
Careful about the wet spot.

42:56.620 --> 43:00.000
-Someone might've spilled something. Ow.
-Yeah. I'm not gonna do that.

MAN: Bye now! Have a nice trip!

43:55.720 --> 43:57.970
Not bad. Maybe I was wrong about you.

43:58.050 --> 44:00.720
Yeah, maybe next time
you should ask me if I have any ideas

44:00.810 --> 44:02.640
before you risk your life unnecessarily.

44:02.730 --> 44:06.230
Ooh. Was this your way of saying
that you don't want me to die?

44:06.310 --> 44:07.310
I didn't say that.

44:07.400 --> 44:11.030
-Oh, so now you want me to die?
-(CHUCKLES) And I didn't say that either.

44:11.110 --> 44:12.900
-Not buyin' it, kid.
-It's Lady.

44:12.990 --> 44:14.820
Oh. Nice to meet ya, Lady.

44:14.900 --> 44:16.410
Nice to meet you, too...

44:16.490 --> 44:19.200
Oh, I never asked you your name.
What's your name?

44:19.280 --> 44:20.790
Oh, I get called a lot of things.

44:20.870 --> 44:25.420
You know, I get Buddy or Pooch
or Spot or Butch or Scram

44:25.500 --> 44:27.670
-or Hey, get out of the trash.

I'm free to be whoever I wanna be.

Free to be myself
and free to be by myself.

I walk however I wanna walk.

-No.

45:26.430 --> 45:28.140
I'm not the best technical singer.

45:28.230 --> 45:30.610
But sometimes it's not
about pitch or tone.

45:30.690 --> 45:32.360
-It's just about...
-Volume?

45:32.440 --> 45:34.650

in this big, old world.

46:05.060 --> 46:06.850
Yeah. I'll bet there is.

46:06.930 --> 46:10.100
Hey. That park is pretty.

46:10.190 --> 46:12.610
Ugh, there's a lot of bones
buried in that park.

is the oldest fire hydrant in the city.

Chinese scraps, meat and potato scraps.

46:52.100 --> 46:54.190
-They got it all.
-And they just give it to you?

No, not just anyone. But to me, yes.

(CHUCKLES) Okay.
Well, let's give it a try.

47:01.070 --> 47:02.700
Don't we have to get you home?

I still have a home to get back to.

that you said it would.

that's what I wanted to hear, but it...

But there was a lot behind that fence.

My life was full of love and meaning.

We were a family.

It doesn't matter how much howling I do,
I feel bad about leaving them.

You don't have to worry
about leaving them.

I know how much it hurts...

What's goin' on, Peg?

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:30.370
Doesn't matter. It's...

01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:31.950
It's too late.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.960

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.090
Oh, man.

01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:45.430
I gotta fix it. I don't know if I can,
but I... I gotta try. I have to.

01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:47.180
-We get it.
-I don't!

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:48.760
Just let her know how you feel.

Here.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.240

01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:54.450
Did you steal that one, too?

01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:55.870
No.

01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:57.000
It was a gift.

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.330
A borrowed gift that, um...

01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.630
Okay, yep, I stole it.

01:15:01.710 --> 01:15:02.750
Uh-huh.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.880
Look, um...

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.260
Back at the train yard...

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:10.680
I'm so sorry for, um...

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.760
I never should've left your side.

01:15:13.850 --> 01:15:15.010
You said it yourself.

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:18.270
Nobody else is loyal,
so why should you be?

01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:19.850
I should've just believed you.

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:22.770
No. You shouldn't have believed me.

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:27.860
Whatever I said about that, about,
you know, being free and...

01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:30.740
That was not true.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.490
Because being free without you there,
now it's just...

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.040
That's just... being alone.

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:47.050
Look, um, you know I'm a street dog.
And I don't have much value to anyone...

01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:48.630
Don't you say that.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.340
You have value to me.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.890
I missed you.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.720
Missed you, too.

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:03.060
Sometimes I come outside at night
just to howl at the moon.

01:16:03.650 --> 01:16:06.730
(CHUCKLES) Well, that...
That doesn't have to end.

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:10.450
We could howl again. We can run free.

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:27.000
I belong here... with Jim Dear,

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:29.590
They depend on me.

01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:33.130

01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:37.430
You're right.

You deserve it, too.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:46.230
You deserve love.

upset about her experience at the pound.

Wow, look at you with a collar.

01:35:26.230 --> 01:35:28.940
-You almost look like a family dog.
-(CHUCKLES LIGHTLY)

01:35:29.020 --> 01:35:30.270
Can you believe it?

01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:33.610
Well, you'll always be the Tramp to me.

01:35:33.690 --> 01:35:34.820
Ha, ha.

01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:37.950
So, how does it feel?

01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:40.110
You know, it kinda feels...

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:42.160
What, too tight? Too itchy?

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:43.240
No, um...

01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:45.580
Might take some gettin' used to.

01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:46.960
LADY: Hmm.

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:50.120
Was gonna say, it kinda feels, um...

01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:52.040
like home.

01:35:52.590 --> 01:35:58.010
DARLING: (SINGING)
Silent as the snowflake in the night

01:35:58.090 --> 01:36:03.640
Holy is the spirit of this night

01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:09.060
All the world is calm and peaceful

01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:14.690
All the world is bright and joyful

01:36:14.770 --> 01:36:19.320
Spirit of love

01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:24.700
And child of peace

01:36:25.410 --> 01:36:30.000
Love unending

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:35.550
That shall not cease

01:36:36.170 --> 01:36:41.590
Peace, my children

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:45.890
Of goodwill

01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:49.730
Peace, my children

01:36:49.810 --> 01:36:53.520
Peace, be still

01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:10.560
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

01:38:15.810 --> 01:38:18.110
WOMAN: (SINGING) Two times is good

01:38:20.190 --> 01:38:25.030
Twice the beauty, twice the fun
More than for once

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:29.870
'Cause inside, we're cooking up

01:38:30.990 --> 01:38:34.960
A lifetime of adventures

01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:37.880
Mischief and romance

01:38:38.590 --> 01:38:39.920
That's the good stuff

01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:42.380
That's enough

01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:47.050
Never mind your pedigree

01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:51.180
You and me, babe, that's a match

01:38:51.260 --> 01:38:55.060
Let's make new memories

01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:58.100
Think of schemes that we can hatch

01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:02.190
Make magic out of simple things

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:05.240
A few bones, our home and some pups

01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:06.450
Yeah

01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:07.910
That's the good stuff

01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:10.490
That's enough

01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:14.870
So, I was thinking

01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:18.460
If you and I could take the day off

01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:22.500
Go around town
Visit some of our favorite spots

01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:24.960
'Cause there's nothing like

01:39:25.050 --> 01:39:27.050
Spending time together
You know, you and I

01:39:28.130 --> 01:39:30.260
How about we get into some big trouble?

01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:32.930
Yeah

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.140
You know that kind of trouble

01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:39.310
Oh, come on, yeah

01:39:40.270 --> 01:39:44.110
Better than ever now

01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:47.240
While we're howling at the moon

01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:51.240
Feeling invincible

01:39:51.320 --> 01:39:54.620
'Cause you and me, we're in cahoots

01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:57.790
Now, the thing that I would switch up

01:39:58.500 --> 01:40:01.250
Some black cat couldn't change my love

01:40:02.630 --> 01:40:05.170
I got you, babe

01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:09.430
Oh, we've got each other now

01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:11.050
That's the good stuff

01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:13.430
That's enough
