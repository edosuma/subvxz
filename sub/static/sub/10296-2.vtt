You don't know
how to unwind.

12:31.567 --> 12:36.133
Or keep house or get a job
or bring any money home.

12:36.133 --> 12:39.334
Now, eh, let's look
at our complimentary

12:39.334 --> 12:43.234
 <i>Dumpwater Floridian</i> and see
what the town has to offer.

12:43.234 --> 12:45.901
Uh...where's
the entertainment section?

12:45.901 --> 12:48.968
Ah.
Page two.

12:48.968 --> 12:51.434
Here we go.

12:51.434 --> 12:52.701
Oh, look.

12:52.701 --> 12:57.434
There's a two-headed pickled
goat down by the courthouse.

12:57.434 --> 12:58.534
Oh, Al.

12:58.534 --> 13:01.434
Let's do something
we can't do at home.

13:01.434 --> 13:03.200
Fine. How about looking
for a good meal?

13:03.200 --> 13:05.067
Let's not argue.

13:05.067 --> 13:08.334
As pathetic as it is,
you are my husband,

13:08.334 --> 13:10.133
and this is
our vacation.

13:10.133 --> 13:11.501
That's the spirit, Peg.

13:11.501 --> 13:14.367
Ah...look here.

13:14.367 --> 13:15.367
Tonight at the high school--

13:15.367 --> 13:17.901
"Meet the man
who met Andy Griffith."

13:21.701 --> 13:23.100
Are you that jaded, Peg?

13:23.767 --> 13:24.934
Hi.

13:24.934 --> 13:27.434
I brought you some towels
and some T.P.

13:27.434 --> 13:29.501
Didn't you see the
"Do not disturb" sign?

13:29.501 --> 13:32.200
Oh, we just put that out
as a nicety.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.934
I mean, nobody
here's gonna disturb you.

13:37.534 --> 13:39.567
I'll just put the T.P.
in the B.R.

13:39.567 --> 13:40.968
No, no.

13:40.968 --> 13:42.234
Not over there.

13:42.234 --> 13:45.534
Could you put it down
over there?

13:52.033 --> 13:54.133
You look like a nice couple.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.400
Oh, you too.

14:01.868 --> 14:05.734
I picked this towel
special for you.

14:05.734 --> 14:08.767
Don't tell anybody
that I gave it to you.

14:08.767 --> 14:11.501
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

14:11.501 --> 14:13.400
Gee, I don't know.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.434
Al, you want her
to bend over again

14:15.434 --> 14:20.868
you know, to pick up
your tongue or anything?

14:20.868 --> 14:23.133
Peg, just stand there and age.

14:23.133 --> 14:24.701
I'm busy.

14:24.701 --> 14:28.200
Let me get the door
for you.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.667
Your husband really
is sweet.

14:32.667 --> 14:35.567
Hm. That must be why
the flies love him.

14:40.901 --> 14:45.667
Don't you forget to use
that special towel now.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.467
She's out the door, Al.

14:50.467 --> 14:51.868
Gee, this is nice here.

14:51.868 --> 14:53.334
Let's move here.

14:53.334 --> 14:56.000
Well, you just keep pulling
in those big bucks,

14:56.000 --> 15:00.934
and in 100 years, maybe we can
afford a shack just like this.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.734
You're jealous because
you don't have a special towel.

15:03.734 --> 15:05.734
Oh, why don't you
take a shower

15:05.734 --> 15:09.834
and wash off
that special odor.

15:09.834 --> 15:11.634
You know, Peg, I don't know
what's so special

15:11.634 --> 15:13.033
about this towel.

15:13.033 --> 15:15.000
We'll steal it anyway.

15:19.968 --> 15:22.234
"3 a.m."

15:22.234 --> 15:23.501
"3 a.m."

15:23.501 --> 15:25.100
Damn, I had 3 a.m.
last time.

15:25.100 --> 15:29.934
Hell, we always find
the bodies before 3 a.m.

15:29.934 --> 15:32.767
Here's my dollar.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.534
All right!
Midnight.

15:36.534 --> 15:38.300
ALL: Ooh.

15:39.968 --> 15:41.501
Hey, Becky.

15:41.501 --> 15:43.234
You want in?

15:43.234 --> 15:45.234
Still a couple of times
left in the lottery.

15:45.234 --> 15:47.367
No!

15:47.367 --> 15:49.400
I think it's terrible you
betting on what time

15:49.400 --> 15:51.033
that poor obnoxious
family's going to get chopped

15:51.033 --> 15:53.801
into little bitty pieces.

15:53.801 --> 15:57.601
And for what, $20?

15:57.601 --> 15:59.200
It's up to 25.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.300
I'm in.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.167
Show us.
What you got?

16:06.167 --> 16:07.467
Shh!

16:07.467 --> 16:09.200
It's the youngun's.

16:22.567 --> 16:25.667
That poor little
white-haired girl.

16:25.667 --> 16:28.367
You'd think she'd
throw some dye on it.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.734
Can I help you?

16:31.734 --> 16:34.067
Yeah, is there
any actual food here,

16:34.067 --> 16:37.167
or do I just stand by a bug
light with my mouth open?

16:38.634 --> 16:40.734
Hey, even bumpkins
have feelings, Kell.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.000
What do you want?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.868
A bus ticket
and a real family,

16:43.868 --> 16:47.300
but for now, I'll settle
for a couple burgers.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.434
Two burgers, Beanie!

16:53.367 --> 16:54.734
How about you?

16:54.734 --> 16:55.767
Is he the cook?

16:55.767 --> 16:57.100
Yep.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.300
I'll have a coke.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.434
Unopened.

17:05.767 --> 17:07.067
Well, Bud.

17:07.067 --> 17:08.133
Here we are.

17:08.133 --> 17:10.767
Another great Bundy vacation.

17:10.767 --> 17:13.634
You know, other kids, they get
to go to Europe or Hawaii.

17:13.634 --> 17:14.800
No.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.567
We get to go to <i>Hee-haw.</i>

17:16.567 --> 17:22.800
There's not another
human being for mi-- Hello.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.400
See you in a week.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.400
Where are you going?

17:25.400 --> 17:28.868
To get buns for my burger.

17:28.868 --> 17:32.167
Hey Kell, Mom and Dad said not
to wander off without them.

17:32.167 --> 17:34.701
Mom will understand.

17:46.334 --> 17:48.767
Thanks, Kell.
That's real nice.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.634
Leave me
with the tree people.

17:54.567 --> 17:56.767
Your drink's ready.

17:56.767 --> 17:59.834
I'm going to go ax
the burgers now.

17:59.834 --> 18:01.334
Fine.

18:01.334 --> 18:04.300
There won't be any screaming,
will there?

18:25.734 --> 18:27.367
To Dixie!

18:33.467 --> 18:36.200
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.167
I wasn't scared.

18:38.167 --> 18:42.601
It was a...reflex
action from the war.

18:42.601 --> 18:44.400
Sit down.

18:46.167 --> 18:51.167
So, uh, you don't smell like
everybody else around here.

18:51.167 --> 18:52.467
Well, thank you.

18:52.467 --> 18:54.801
They say you're
from Chicago.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.000
Yep. Chicago.
Chi-town.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.968
The Windy City.

18:59.968 --> 19:02.501
My kind of town.

19:02.501 --> 19:04.200
It must be exciting.

19:04.200 --> 19:09.934
Well, it is for me.
I'm a cop.

See, I made my money--
There he is.

19:19.167 --> 19:24.067
Oh, Bud, did you take
your milk of magnesia?

19:24.067 --> 19:25.167
He didn't.

19:26.234 --> 19:27.467
Bud.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.467
How do you expect to get rid
of that constipation

19:29.467 --> 19:31.567
if you won't
take your laxatives.

19:34.133 --> 19:37.367
Hey, Bud, you made
a little friend, huh?

19:37.367 --> 19:38.367
Yeah, and you can help.

19:38.367 --> 19:40.334
You got any pictures
of me on the potty

19:40.334 --> 19:41.601
you'd like to show her?

19:41.601 --> 19:43.634
Well, excuse us,
Mr. Sensitive.

Have you seen
your sister?

No, thank you.
I don't drink.

you guys were here.

20:03.601 --> 20:05.200
Well, we were
gonna go for a walk,

20:05.200 --> 20:07.434
but we heard
on the radio it might rain.

20:07.434 --> 20:11.834
Hey, goob,
that radio upstairs stinks.

20:11.834 --> 20:13.567
Now I'm paying $8 American,
all right?.

20:13.567 --> 20:15.367
Get one of these guys
out of the pigpen

20:15.367 --> 20:17.234
and let's get
that thing working, huh?

Hey, who wants
some down-home cooking?

Hey, Elmo, vittles
for the family.

20:21.767 --> 20:25.801
Uh, Al, honey, maybe you
should be a little nicer

20:25.801 --> 20:26.801
to these people.

20:26.801 --> 20:28.000
I don't think
they like us.

Hey, Peg, I get
yelled at all year long.

20:31.033 --> 20:32.701
Now this is my money
and my vacation.

20:32.701 --> 20:34.434
My turn to be
the customer.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.167
But Al, it's obnoxious.

Treat people like scum, and they
just can't do enough for you.

I mean, everybody
was so friendly to us.

were our last night on Earth.

Dad, can we go down to the
high school tomorrow night

21:14.267 --> 21:16.200
and meet the man who met
Andy Griffith?

21:16.200 --> 21:19.033
Since when do you
like Andy Griffith?

21:19.033 --> 21:22.534
Since Gloria
wants to go.

21:22.534 --> 21:24.334
Bud's in love.

I am not.

it's just your beer belly.

do this at home.
