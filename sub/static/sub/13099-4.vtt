WEBVTT

00:02.667 --> 00:04.917
[instrumental music]

00:14.292 --> 00:16.917
Repair crews report they'll be
finished by 1500 hours.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
Good, I wanna send a message
to Babylon 5

00:20.083 --> 00:23.458
attention of Captain
John Sheridan.

00:23.542 --> 00:24.917
And, uh..

00:25.000 --> 00:27.125
...take this down exactly.

00:39.208 --> 00:40.542
Oh, good, captain,
I was about to call you.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.125
We just received
a message for you.

00:42.208 --> 00:44.375
It's captain Maynard
of the Cortez.

00:44.458 --> 00:47.208
- It's, uh, rather rude, sir.
- Rude?

00:47.292 --> 00:49.458
Unless all your friends
call you "Swamp Rat."

00:49.542 --> 00:51.375
[chuckling]

00:51.458 --> 00:54.375
Oh, that's an old nickname
and a long story.

00:54.458 --> 00:56.167
I have to tell you about it
sometime.

00:56.250 --> 00:58.250
The Cortez is coming here
for resupply.

00:58.333 --> 01:00.458
She sent in the requisition
separately.

01:00.542 --> 01:03.208
She's asking for a lot.
Must've been out a long time.

01:03.292 --> 01:05.292
Yeah, at least five years.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.750
How many Explorer class ships
have ever visited Babylon 5.

01:07.833 --> 01:11.208
- None. Until now.
- You're in for a real treat.

01:11.292 --> 01:13.792
Explorer ship coming
through the gate, commander.

01:13.875 --> 01:15.917
[whirring]

01:19.625 --> 01:22.667
[dramatic music]

01:49.083 --> 01:51.083
[whizzing]

01:52.625 --> 01:55.625
[music continues]

01:55.708 --> 01:57.792
Impressive.

01:57.875 --> 01:59.833
Take a good look, people.

01:59.917 --> 02:01.542
If you're supremely lucky,
you may see

02:01.625 --> 02:04.042
two ships like her
in your lifetime.

02:04.125 --> 02:07.792
Captain, I believe
your friend Stinky has arrived.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.750
(male narrator)
The Babylon project
was our last

02:15.833 --> 02:18.375
best hope for peace.

02:18.458 --> 02:21.208
A self-contained world
five miles long

02:21.292 --> 02:23.792
located in neutral territory.

02:26.958 --> 02:28.917
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

02:29.000 --> 02:32.917
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.958
A shining beacon in space

02:36.042 --> 02:38.208
all alone in the night.

02:38.292 --> 02:41.708
It was the dawn
of the third age of mankind

02:41.792 --> 02:45.875
the year the Great War
came upon us all.

02:45.958 --> 02:50.000
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.292
The year is 2259.

02:52.375 --> 02:55.583
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

02:55.667 --> 02:58.708
[theme music]

03:28.333 --> 03:31.458
[music continues]

03:42.083 --> 03:44.583
[instrumental music]

03:49.125 --> 03:51.333
It's really great
to see you, Jack.

03:51.417 --> 03:53.250
Yeah. You, too, John.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.750
Last I heard, you were
heading for the Rim.

03:55.833 --> 03:59.333
Yeah, we spent two years
mapping most of sector 900.

03:59.417 --> 04:02.250
You'll probably get the updated
star charts in about a month.

04:02.333 --> 04:05.125
I saw you on the news when they
announced your posting here.

04:05.208 --> 04:08.292
Don't tell me you get ISN all
the way out on the Rim now?

04:08.375 --> 04:10.375
[chuckles]
Hell, no. No, no.

04:10.458 --> 04:11.833
We got called back in
to do a repair

04:11.917 --> 04:13.708
on one of the Euphrates' gates.

04:13.792 --> 04:15.292
Well, we had to do
a resupply anyway

04:15.375 --> 04:19.667
so, when I heard the news,
thought we ought to stop in.

04:19.750 --> 04:23.458
- Captain, there you are.
- Yes, ambassador.

04:23.542 --> 04:27.542
Jack, this Ambassador Delenn
of the Minbari Federation.

04:27.625 --> 04:29.583
Ambassador,
Captain Jack Maynard.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.375
- Ambassador.
- Captain.

04:31.458 --> 04:33.417
I was hoping to convene
a meeting of the council

04:33.500 --> 04:36.375
later this week to discuss
the problems in sector 19.

04:36.458 --> 04:38.875
No problem,
I'll rearrange my calendar.

04:38.958 --> 04:40.875
Let me know when
and I'll be there.

04:40.958 --> 04:43.417
Thank you. Captain.

04:47.458 --> 04:51.708
- John, she's Minbari?
- Uh-huh.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.375
Well, she doesn't look like one.

04:53.458 --> 04:55.583
I mean, she does,
but, but she doesn't.

04:55.667 --> 04:57.125
I mean, what's the deal?

04:57.208 --> 04:59.292
Still trying
to figure that out.

04:59.375 --> 05:01.458
There's the story she told us,
but, then

05:01.542 --> 05:04.625
the Minbari never tell you
the whole truth.

05:04.708 --> 05:07.625
I know what you mean.

05:07.708 --> 05:11.750
Ah, this is some kind of setup
you're running here, John.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.375
Yeah, it's big, beautiful,
and crazy-making.

05:14.458 --> 05:16.542
There's more going on here
every minute of every day

05:16.625 --> 05:19.208
than anywhere else
I've ever served.

05:20.458 --> 05:23.250
Yeah, it's quite a job.

05:23.333 --> 05:25.667
Never thought I'd see you
in one like it.

05:27.042 --> 05:29.083
Listen, doc, I appreciate
your concern

05:29.167 --> 05:31.875
but I eat what I want,
when I want, as much as I want.

05:31.958 --> 05:33.458
That's before you were shot.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.208
Right now you still have
iron deficiency.

05:35.292 --> 05:37.500
Your blood pressure's always
been a little high.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.083
I'm prescribing you presslocomp

05:39.167 --> 05:41.833
and putting you on a restricted
diet so you'll mend faster.

05:41.917 --> 05:45.708
Oh, but it's time for me to make
my favorite meal, bagna cauda.

05:45.792 --> 05:49.042
- What is it?
- It's a kind of Italian fondue.

05:49.125 --> 05:52.458
So you start with a pint
of olive oil, extra virgin.

05:52.542 --> 05:55.083
Yeah, then you melt about a
quarter pound of butter into it.

05:55.167 --> 05:58.250
Oh, man, then you take garlic,
lots and lots of garlic

05:58.333 --> 05:59.250
and anchovies--

05:59.333 --> 06:01.292
Anchovies? Forget it.

06:01.375 --> 06:03.250
Too much salt. And no bread.

06:03.333 --> 06:07.167
Come on, doc!
No salt, no bread, no anchovies?

06:07.250 --> 06:09.583
- No bagna cauda.
- Tough.

06:11.250 --> 06:13.833
Here's a list of things
I want you to try to avoid.

06:17.458 --> 06:21.000
But I-I like all this stuff,
es-es-especially..

06:21.083 --> 06:23.042
Oh, c-come on.

06:23.125 --> 06:26.750
- Doc. Doc. Doc. Doc. Doc.
- Hmm?

06:26.833 --> 06:29.583
- There's nothing left.
- Oh, sure there is.

06:29.667 --> 06:30.958
[beeping]

06:31.042 --> 06:34.958
Here, this is what you can eat.
See, all kinds of things.

06:38.542 --> 06:39.958
You're serious about this,
aren't you?

06:40.042 --> 06:42.167
Well, I'm not only serious about
you following the plan,

06:42.250 --> 06:43.583
but this gives me
the perfect excuse

06:43.667 --> 06:45.375
to call all ranking station
personnel

06:45.458 --> 06:47.458
for an atherogenic
factor profile.

06:47.542 --> 06:50.917
People don't eat right,
skip meals

06:51.000 --> 06:52.333
eat strange things at odd hours.

06:52.417 --> 06:54.875
I mean, someone has to
look after your health.

06:54.958 --> 06:56.292
[sighs]

06:56.375 --> 06:58.542
Okay, fine. Diet.

06:58.625 --> 07:03.000
- No, no, no. Food plan.
- Got it.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.500
Mr. Garibaldi.

07:05.583 --> 07:07.667
You'll be needing these.

07:07.750 --> 07:12.625
And Mr. Garibaldi? I will be
monitoring you closely.

07:14.917 --> 07:17.667
[instrumental music]

07:17.750 --> 07:21.500
The Narn and Centauri
were at each other's throats.

07:21.583 --> 07:23.542
The Vorlons had some kind
of an agenda

07:23.625 --> 07:25.250
that no one can understand.

07:25.333 --> 07:28.667
The Minbari leadership
hated me immediately

07:28.750 --> 07:30.167
and unconditionally.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.958
And Ambassador Delenn
was hibernating

07:32.042 --> 07:33.667
in some kind of a cocoon.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.042
And that was just the end
of the first day.

07:36.125 --> 07:37.417
[laughing]

07:37.500 --> 07:40.542
So are you handling it?

07:40.625 --> 07:42.500
One day at a time.

07:43.958 --> 07:46.292
I always figured
we'd be having this drink

07:46.375 --> 07:48.708
out on the Rim somewhere.

07:48.792 --> 07:52.208
You always said
you wanted an Explorer ship.

07:52.292 --> 07:54.708
Yeah, well,
when the president calls

07:54.792 --> 07:56.833
it's kind of hard to say no.

07:56.917 --> 07:59.750
Funny he should pick someone
that the Minbari

07:59.833 --> 08:01.375
don't particularly like.

08:01.458 --> 08:03.875
Well, I, I try to accord them

08:03.958 --> 08:06.042
every courtesy
so they can't complain.

08:06.125 --> 08:09.375
- Not too much anyway.
- What about you, Johnny?

08:09.458 --> 08:12.917
This isn't exactly
what you trained for.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.625
It's not really what you wanted.

08:14.708 --> 08:17.083
Jack, I can make
a difference here.

08:17.167 --> 08:19.708
It's important.

08:19.792 --> 08:21.625
I suppose.

08:21.708 --> 08:24.625
I just never figured that

08:24.708 --> 08:26.583
a die-hard spacer like you

08:26.667 --> 08:29.000
would wind up tied to a desk.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.250
Well, it's a hell of a desk
to be tied to.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.458
- To a good visit on Babylon 5.
- Babylon 5.

08:41.417 --> 08:43.000
(Garibaldi)
'The Glory Shop, Green Tiger'

08:43.083 --> 08:45.083
Finagle's Place they've all
filed written complaints.

08:45.167 --> 08:47.083
And the cart vendors have been
bending my ear about it

08:47.167 --> 08:48.583
everytime I walk through
the Zocalo.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.250
So, what're you doing about it?

08:50.333 --> 08:52.042
We're running checking
security-system videos

08:52.125 --> 08:54.750
in the stores to see if we pick
up familiar faces.

08:54.833 --> 08:56.750
I've doubled the Zocalo watch
in the rush hours.

08:56.833 --> 08:58.125
But hasn't helped so far.

08:58.208 --> 09:00.625
Sounds like a petty shoplifting
wave, Mr. Garibaldi.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.250
Surely you can handle it.

09:02.333 --> 09:05.083
Yes, I can, but I just thought
you'd wanna be informed.

09:05.167 --> 09:07.083
I appreciate that,
but it's your job.

09:07.167 --> 09:09.417
I'll expect a full report when
you've apprehend the thieves.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.375
Understood?

09:10.458 --> 09:11.500
But I thought you wanted to know

09:11.583 --> 09:13.042
everything that went on
in the station

09:13.125 --> 09:15.500
Everything important,
Mr. Garibaldi.

09:15.583 --> 09:18.792
I expect you to handle the
details in terms of security.

09:21.208 --> 09:23.875
Yes, sir.

09:23.958 --> 09:25.458
But I-I'd rather hear
your stories.

09:25.542 --> 09:28.292
I mean, you gotta remember,
I hear the same ones

09:28.375 --> 09:30.375
over and over again
for years on my ship.

09:30.458 --> 09:32.583
The only relief I get
is when we make supply a stop.

09:32.667 --> 09:34.542
Yeah, but your stories
are much more interesting.

09:34.625 --> 09:36.833
- Not necessarily.
- Well..

09:36.917 --> 09:39.458
Well, there was that time
that you took leave on Mars

09:39.542 --> 09:41.917
and that dancer, as I recall..

09:42.000 --> 09:45.125
- Uh, Captain Sheridan?
- Yes, Captain Maynard?

09:45.208 --> 09:47.792
July 12, uh, 2253.

09:47.875 --> 09:49.625
Oh, forget I said anything.

09:49.708 --> 09:51.708
[laughing]

09:53.708 --> 09:55.083
So where are you headed next,
captain?

09:55.167 --> 09:57.458
Oh, back out to the Rim.
The new Rim.

09:57.542 --> 09:59.750
Now that we've finished
mapping Sector 900.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.708
We're hoping to build
two new jumpgates by the end

10:01.792 --> 10:03.417
'of the year
and then have Earth follow up'

10:03.500 --> 10:04.708
'with, uh, survey ships.'

10:04.792 --> 10:06.292
Captain, you've done
a lot more traveling

10:06.375 --> 10:08.708
in hyperspace than just about
anybody else here.

10:08.792 --> 10:10.042
Is there any truth
to the stories?

10:10.125 --> 10:11.667
- What stories?
- 'Well, you know.'

10:11.750 --> 10:14.333
Things happen out there.
People see weird things.

10:14.417 --> 10:16.333
"Universe Today" had a story
a couple of months ago

10:16.417 --> 10:18.333
asking if something
was living in hyperspace.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.333
Nothing can live in hyperspace.

10:20.417 --> 10:23.000
Well, what do you say, captain?

10:23.083 --> 10:27.083
Well, living? I don't know
about that, lieutenant.

10:27.167 --> 10:29.417
But there's something out there.

10:29.500 --> 10:33.083
And I think it's stranger
than any one of us can imagine.

10:33.167 --> 10:36.250
[instrumenal music]

10:37.292 --> 10:38.542
Were you serious when you said

10:38.625 --> 10:40.833
something was out there
in hyperspace?

10:40.917 --> 10:42.250
Serious? What do you mean?

10:42.333 --> 10:44.708
You weren't just yanking
their chains a little

10:44.792 --> 10:48.542
building up a story
to tweak their imaginations?

10:48.625 --> 10:51.500
No, no. I saw something once.

10:54.542 --> 10:56.042
Go on.

10:56.125 --> 10:59.208
Well, it wasn't in hyperspace,
though.

10:59.292 --> 11:01.250
But you know,
things can get kind of weird

11:01.333 --> 11:03.708
out on the Rim too.

11:03.792 --> 11:06.000
It's funny, you never know
what you're gonna find

11:06.083 --> 11:08.875
when you look over the edge
of what's known

11:08.958 --> 11:11.917
and into what's not.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.292
We were in Sector 857,
I took my NAV officer

11:15.375 --> 11:17.167
Lieutenant Patrick with me
for a look-around

11:17.250 --> 11:18.958
in one of our scout ships.

11:19.042 --> 11:20.750
- And?
- 'Well.'

11:20.833 --> 11:23.917
I noticed that we'd gotten out
of sight of the Cortez

11:24.000 --> 11:25.583
and I was,
I was just about ready

11:25.667 --> 11:29.417
to turn back
when I saw something.

11:29.500 --> 11:33.000
It was maybe
1000 kilometers away

11:33.083 --> 11:34.750
black against space.

11:34.833 --> 11:37.417
Now, the reason that I know
it was there

11:37.500 --> 11:40.500
is that it blotted out
the stars behind it.

11:40.583 --> 11:42.167
I don't know the exact
shape of it

11:42.250 --> 11:45.625
but it was big.

11:45.708 --> 11:48.750
I turned to Pat,
asked him if he could see it

11:48.833 --> 11:52.250
and when I looked back,
it had vanished.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.542
You are the second person
in a month to tell me

11:54.625 --> 11:58.792
that there's something strange
going on out on the Rim.

11:58.875 --> 12:00.000
Did your NAV officer see it?

12:00.083 --> 12:02.750
Oh, h-he says he saw a..

12:02.833 --> 12:05.458
...blink, a change in space.

12:05.542 --> 12:08.917
Ah! He doesn't know what it was
any more than I do.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.708
But it's there.
And it was real.

12:12.792 --> 12:17.250
Oh, it still sends a shiver up
my back when I think about it.

12:22.167 --> 12:24.875
[instrumental music]

12:26.417 --> 12:29.917
No, no, no. I don't see how
I can do this, Garibaldi.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.333
Look, if it's the credits
you're worried about

12:31.417 --> 12:32.500
my account can handle it.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.083
Money's not the issue
and you know it.

12:34.167 --> 12:36.708
What you want is heavy.
You won't use substitutes.

12:36.792 --> 12:38.208
And the reals stuff's hard
to come by.

12:38.292 --> 12:39.833
Freighters don't like
to carry stuff this

12:39.917 --> 12:41.917
'cause they can give space
to lighter weight items.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.250
Man, I'm gonna have
to hump to get this,

12:43.333 --> 12:44.375
even if I can get it at all.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.167
Alright, alright, look.

12:46.250 --> 12:49.667
There's a bonus in it.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.958
Look, I'm working on it.
That's all I can say.

12:52.042 --> 12:53.667
Alright, good enough. Oh!

12:53.750 --> 12:57.042
One last thing. Don't mention
this to Dr. Franklin, okay?

12:57.125 --> 12:59.208
Oh, okay, no problem.
But that's gonna cost you.

12:59.292 --> 13:01.833
It's gonna cost me for you
to say nothing to somebody?

13:01.917 --> 13:04.000
How much for you to say nothing
to everybody?

13:04.083 --> 13:06.167
Oh, you couldn't afford it.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.875
Ten pounds?

13:10.958 --> 13:13.500
Well, a 10-pound gain
isn't too bad.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.000
You could afford to lose it.

13:15.083 --> 13:17.958
Here's a list of foods
I want you to avoid.

13:18.042 --> 13:21.000
No meat, low fat,
lots of vegetables.

13:21.083 --> 13:22.333
That's rabbit food.

13:22.417 --> 13:24.083
Well, it's only for a little
while, captain.

13:24.167 --> 13:27.042
We'll get those 10 pounds off
in no time.

13:27.125 --> 13:28.500
Who's we?

13:28.583 --> 13:30.917
Well, a doctor and his patient
are a team, captain.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.792
- Don't you agree?
- Sure.

13:33.875 --> 13:38.042
And since we're a team,
why don't you do the diet part?

13:42.333 --> 13:46.875
I'm not sure I understand the
intent of this meeting, Teronn.

13:46.958 --> 13:50.833
I have been delegated
by others who..

13:50.917 --> 13:56.917
Delenn, there is concern among
our people here on Babylon 5.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.083
Meaning no disrespect.

13:59.167 --> 14:03.083
They worry that you
are no longer one of us.

14:05.167 --> 14:10.750
I am more "one of us" at this
moment than I have ever been.

14:10.833 --> 14:13.083
More than you will ever know.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.500
I appreciate your concern,

14:17.583 --> 14:20.708
there is nothing
I can tell you at this time.

14:20.792 --> 14:22.750
- Later.
- This cannot wait.

14:22.833 --> 14:25.667
We need to understand
what is happening.

14:25.750 --> 14:30.625
Understanding is not required,
only obedience.

14:30.708 --> 14:33.375
To our own kind, yes.

14:33.458 --> 14:34.833
But that is the question.

14:34.917 --> 14:39.167
Are you any longer our own kind?
We have a right to know.

14:41.375 --> 14:45.292
If you cannot give us what
we need, we will ask permission

14:45.375 --> 14:46.458
to send a representative

14:46.542 --> 14:49.583
to speak directly
with the Grey Council.

14:49.667 --> 14:55.458
- Unless you object?
- No.

14:55.542 --> 14:59.458
No, I have no objections.
Is there anything else?

14:59.542 --> 15:01.750
No. Thank you.

15:02.917 --> 15:06.000
[instrumental music]

15:10.542 --> 15:11.958
If everything's satisfactory,
doctor,

15:12.042 --> 15:13.125
I'll be returning to my duties.

15:13.208 --> 15:15.625
Just one last thing, commander.

15:15.708 --> 15:18.667
I worked out this food plan
for you.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.833
Are you telling me
to go on a diet?

15:20.917 --> 15:22.458
I'll have you know, I don't have
an ounce of fat on my body.

15:22.542 --> 15:24.583
I exercise vigorously once a day
and despite my injury--

15:24.667 --> 15:27.875
B-but when you eat, you don't
eat enough of the right things.

15:27.958 --> 15:29.792
'You have deficiencies
in calcium'

15:29.875 --> 15:31.417
'iron and several other
minerals'

15:31.500 --> 15:32.792
and it's hampering recovery.

15:32.875 --> 15:34.333
Now, I recommend iron
supplements

15:34.417 --> 15:35.625
and an increased diet.

15:35.708 --> 15:38.583
Uh, food plan
to replenish your system.

15:41.250 --> 15:44.250
- I'll gain weight!
- Well, briefly, yes.

15:46.042 --> 15:48.958
Figures. All my life I've fought
against imperialism.

15:49.042 --> 15:52.667
Now suddenly, I am the expanding
Russian frontier.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.667
But with very nice borders.

15:54.750 --> 15:58.333
(male #1)
'Central Supply, we need a final
data check on issued supplies.'

15:58.417 --> 16:00.458
(male #2)
'Roger that, Cortez,
we've got..'

16:00.542 --> 16:02.958
I'll see you when you come back
this way again.

16:03.042 --> 16:04.625
Well, it might be a few years.

16:04.708 --> 16:06.083
I sure wish
I were going with you.

16:06.167 --> 16:10.042
Yeah, the big empty
has a way of grabbing at a man.

16:10.125 --> 16:14.333
It's still just a-a job
to get done, you know.

16:14.417 --> 16:17.583
Duty hours, routine.
Dull stuff half the time.

16:17.667 --> 16:19.875
Every once in a while,
something interesting happens

16:19.958 --> 16:22.375
but, uh, you know,
the adventure's all in the mind.

16:22.458 --> 16:23.917
Well, as my chief of security
would say

16:24.000 --> 16:26.292
that is a load of horse hockey.

16:26.375 --> 16:30.125
The adventure is out there,
Jack. A man has to go meet it.

16:30.208 --> 16:34.125
Well, sometimes it comes to you.
Wait for it, Johnny.

16:34.208 --> 16:37.042
(man on PA)
'Captain Maynard,
please report to the Cortez.'

16:37.125 --> 16:38.750
'You are wanted aboard.'

16:38.833 --> 16:40.875
'Captain Maynard,
to the Cortez, please.'

16:40.958 --> 16:44.083
That'll be my exec,
pestering me with paperwork.

16:44.167 --> 16:47.417
Yeah, I know the feeling.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.000
Now, listen, Swamp Rat.

16:49.083 --> 16:51.417
You hold this place together,
you hear me?

16:51.500 --> 16:53.417
'I'd like to come back to it.'

16:55.333 --> 16:58.417
[instrumental music]

17:14.750 --> 17:16.875
(female #1)
'Babylon Control,
this is the Cortez.'

17:16.958 --> 17:21.667
'C-1-niner-niner.
We are ready for jump.'

17:21.750 --> 17:23.625
May I?

17:23.708 --> 17:27.625
This is Babylon Control, Cortez.
You are cleared for jump.

17:27.708 --> 17:30.750
[instrumental music]

17:44.042 --> 17:45.833
(John)
'I thought this sort of thing
was supposed to be'

17:45.917 --> 17:47.875
'your area of concern,
commander.'

17:47.958 --> 17:50.625
Yes, sir.
Ordinarily it would be.

17:50.708 --> 17:52.417
The Tokati ambassador objects
to having a new

17:52.500 --> 17:55.542
consular group from Pak'ma'ra
quartered next to him.

17:55.625 --> 17:57.417
He claims they smell bad.

17:57.500 --> 18:01.333
Which of course, they do.
And that he's downwind of them.

18:01.417 --> 18:04.750
I assume you explained
that our air is recycled

18:04.833 --> 18:09.000
and there is no wind
up or down on the station?

18:09.083 --> 18:11.333
Repeatedly, but he insists
he smells something offensive

18:11.417 --> 18:13.917
and that something
must be his neighbors.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.458
He also insists that you
and only you

18:15.542 --> 18:17.750
can straighten out this matter
to his satisfaction.

18:17.833 --> 18:19.708
[sighs]

18:21.250 --> 18:23.958
The Abbai delegation is as large
as the Pak'ma'ra group

18:24.042 --> 18:27.667
and they're two corridors over.

18:27.750 --> 18:29.750
Have them swap quarters.

18:29.833 --> 18:31.917
And you tell the ambassador
that's as upwind

18:32.000 --> 18:34.708
as it gets on Babylon 5, huh.

18:34.792 --> 18:37.542
Done and done.

18:37.625 --> 18:39.792
Is there something else,
commander?

18:39.875 --> 18:42.667
- If I may speak frankly?
- Yeah.

18:42.750 --> 18:47.500
Ever since the Cortez arrived,
you just haven't been yourself.

18:47.583 --> 18:49.875
I thought perhaps you'd like
to talk about it.

18:55.792 --> 18:59.792
I command starships, Susan,
not cities in space.

19:01.042 --> 19:04.208
These problems,
the, the petty complaints

19:04.292 --> 19:08.583
the endless bickering,
the constant negotiations.

19:08.667 --> 19:10.958
Jack Maynard said this isn't
what I was trained for

19:11.042 --> 19:12.792
and he's right.

19:12.875 --> 19:17.208
I mean, I am constantly
sandbagged, swamped, drowned

19:17.292 --> 19:21.167
an-and snowed under
by nothing but trivia!

19:21.250 --> 19:24.333
I mean, look at this desk.

19:24.417 --> 19:27.417
I can't find a thing on it.
You know me.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.792
Is this me? Huh?

19:29.875 --> 19:32.875
Starships run on details.
You've always run a tight ship.

19:32.958 --> 19:34.583
That's an admirable trait.

19:34.667 --> 19:38.750
B5 can never run
in quite the same way.

19:38.833 --> 19:40.792
But you've had to settle
your share of crew squabbles

19:40.875 --> 19:42.458
in your time,
so forgive me for saying this

19:42.542 --> 19:45.000
but it must be something
more than just that.

19:50.208 --> 19:52.083
[sighs]

19:52.167 --> 19:53.875
[instrumental music]

19:53.958 --> 19:56.500
Maynard is right.

19:56.583 --> 19:59.042
- I've been beached.
- Hardly.

19:59.125 --> 20:01.500
Running B5 takes just as much
energy, intelligence

20:01.583 --> 20:03.542
and patience as it does
to command a starship.

20:03.625 --> 20:06.250
But there is a difference.

20:06.333 --> 20:10.792
They have turned me
into a bureaucrat, a politician.

20:10.875 --> 20:13.750
I'll tell you one thing, if the
primates that we came from

20:13.833 --> 20:15.542
had known that someday
politicians

20:15.625 --> 20:17.708
would come out of the,
the gene pool

20:17.792 --> 20:20.250
they'd have stayed up in the
trees and written evolution off

20:20.333 --> 20:23.292
as a bad idea!

20:23.375 --> 20:27.542
Hell, I always thought the
opposable thumb was overrated.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.292
You're here because
the president thought

20:29.375 --> 20:31.375
you could handle it.

20:31.458 --> 20:32.958
As your executive officer,
I have the right

20:33.042 --> 20:35.000
to know...was he wrong?

20:35.083 --> 20:36.958
I don't know.

20:39.458 --> 20:42.833
Maybe he was, and it's just
taken this long to sink in.

20:46.458 --> 20:49.125
Look, uh..

20:49.208 --> 20:52.792
...take those alien delegations
and switch them around.

20:52.875 --> 20:55.917
And see if you can smooth
any ruffled feathers.

20:58.792 --> 21:01.667
Um, refresh my memory.

21:01.750 --> 21:04.875
Does the Tokati ambassador
have feathers?

21:06.750 --> 21:10.083
No, sir. I'll take care of it.

21:11.833 --> 21:13.875
[chuckles]

21:14.500 --> 21:17.208
[intense music]

21:18.583 --> 21:21.000
What's our ETA
on the other side of the..

21:21.083 --> 21:23.125
[screaming]

21:24.292 --> 21:27.042
Emergency power!
All stations report.

21:27.125 --> 21:28.667
XO's hurt bad, sir!

21:28.750 --> 21:30.667
'Well, then get Dr. Hunter
up here on the double'

21:30.750 --> 21:32.542
and check for more casualties.

21:32.625 --> 21:36.292
- Pat, what's our flight status?
- Power's down 30%!

21:36.375 --> 21:37.625
We're flying blind.

21:37.708 --> 21:39.458
After we jumped
the fusion reactor spiked

21:39.542 --> 21:41.917
when it came back online.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.083
The system wasn't ready
to handle it, the EMP blew out

21:44.167 --> 21:45.667
the entire tracking system.

21:45.750 --> 21:48.375
Meaning we lost the lock-on
signal from the jumpgate.

21:48.458 --> 21:51.500
Yes, sir, without it, we can't
find our way out of hyperspace.

21:56.792 --> 21:59.167
[instrumental music]

22:00.875 --> 22:03.292
(Garibaldi)
'It all turned out to be a bunch
of kids stealing on a dare.'

22:03.375 --> 22:04.875
Some kind of initiation thing.

22:04.958 --> 22:06.333
We couldn't get a lock on them
because

22:06.417 --> 22:07.833
it was never the same one twice.

22:07.917 --> 22:10.125
So I slipped some security
guards in as salespeople

22:10.208 --> 22:12.042
and they nailed
one of the kids in the act.

22:12.125 --> 22:14.792
He talked his mouth off.
That was it.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.458
- What did you do with him?
- I spaced him.

22:17.542 --> 22:20.792
[chuckling]
No.

22:20.875 --> 22:22.542
I made them give back
all the stolen stuff

22:22.625 --> 22:24.208
and assigned him
to community service.

22:24.292 --> 22:25.542
Seems rather mild punishment.

22:25.625 --> 22:27.083
Not if the community service

22:27.167 --> 22:29.625
is cleaning out the garbage
recycling unit.

22:33.625 --> 22:35.458
This is all his fault, you know.

22:35.542 --> 22:36.917
- Wait a minute--
- I agree.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.792
This whole diet thing
is your fault.

22:38.875 --> 22:39.792
Food plan.

22:39.875 --> 22:42.875
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

22:42.958 --> 22:44.958
Well, what're we gonna
do about it?

22:50.292 --> 22:51.958
[chuckling]

22:52.042 --> 22:54.083
- Do it nicely.
- Oh.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.500
[clears throat]

23:03.792 --> 23:06.000
[whistles]

23:06.083 --> 23:08.167
[indistinct chatter]

23:11.750 --> 23:13.792
[crackling]

23:17.458 --> 23:18.833
- Anything?
- Power's coming back.

23:18.917 --> 23:20.417
But the navigation's
shot to hell, captain.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.917
- Can you fix it?
- We have the parts.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.500
But not the time, it'll take
48 hours minimum.

23:23.583 --> 23:25.292
By that time,
we'll be swept so off-course

23:25.375 --> 23:26.625
we'll never find
the lock-on signal.

23:26.708 --> 23:28.667
- Well, stay with it.
- Yes, sir.

23:30.875 --> 23:32.042
Start transmitting a mayday.

23:32.125 --> 23:33.375
Our transmission's pretty iffy

23:33.458 --> 23:34.458
this far into hyperspace.

23:34.542 --> 23:35.542
Well, send it anyhow.

23:35.625 --> 23:37.333
Something may get through.

23:37.417 --> 23:40.542
[instrumental music]

23:43.583 --> 23:45.667
Sir, we're getting a message
from the Cortez.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.792
It's a mayday.

23:47.875 --> 23:50.417
Put it on the speaker.

23:50.500 --> 23:53.583
(female #1)
'This is the Cortez,
there's been an accident'

23:53.667 --> 23:55.083
'to navig...instruments.'

23:55.167 --> 23:58.083
'No lock on signal, we are..'

23:58.167 --> 24:01.000
'stranded in hyperspace..
Lost..'

24:01.083 --> 24:04.167
'Please respond.
Mayday. May..'

24:04.250 --> 24:06.333
'Please respond. Mayday.'

24:06.417 --> 24:09.083
'Mayday. Mayday. Mayday.'

24:10.417 --> 24:12.333
Take it off speaker.
Keep recording.

24:12.417 --> 24:14.792
Some other pieces
may come through in the clear.

24:14.875 --> 24:16.583
Send this response immediately.

24:16.667 --> 24:19.542
Your signal has been received
and help is on the way.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.417
- Keep sending that.
- Yes, sir.

24:21.500 --> 24:24.458
I want available pilots in
the squadron bay in 20 minutes.

24:24.542 --> 24:26.000
I shouldn't need to remind you

24:26.083 --> 24:28.667
no ship lost in hyperspace
has ever been found again.

24:30.458 --> 24:31.833
I know.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.375
I do not understand
the necessity

24:37.458 --> 24:40.125
of these frequent examinations,
doctor.

24:40.208 --> 24:42.333
I am fine.

24:42.417 --> 24:44.958
Ambassador, you've been through
quite a change.

24:45.042 --> 24:47.292
Even if I weren't curious
from a scientific point of view

24:47.375 --> 24:49.667
I'm still a doctor
and you're my patient.

24:49.750 --> 24:52.167
I have to make sure you're not
suffering any side effects

24:52.250 --> 24:55.083
of your transition.

24:56.292 --> 24:59.292
- So..
- Nothing of consequence.

24:59.375 --> 25:02.583
Momentary dizziness.
Fatigue. That's all.

25:03.500 --> 25:07.083
Nothing else is bothering you?

25:07.167 --> 25:10.417
How are the other Minbari
reacting to your situation?

25:11.667 --> 25:12.750
Fine.

25:12.833 --> 25:14.500
They accept this
without question?

25:14.583 --> 25:16.250
Of course.

25:17.625 --> 25:20.875
So when does the new
delegation arrive?

25:20.958 --> 25:22.667
- What new delegation?
- I don't know.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.417
I only heard Mr. Garibaldi
mention to someone

25:25.500 --> 25:27.417
that he was awaiting
their arrival.

25:27.500 --> 25:31.333
I believe they're called
bagna cauda?

25:34.667 --> 25:38.167
Commander Ivanova has briefed
you on the situation.

25:39.833 --> 25:42.250
All we know
from the Cortez's mayday

25:42.333 --> 25:46.917
is that something has brought
her down in hyperspace.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.708
As the commander has reminded me

25:48.792 --> 25:52.458
no one has ever recovered
a ship from hyperspace.

25:52.542 --> 25:56.875
- But I'm determined to try.
- How far out is she?

25:56.958 --> 26:01.500
Unknown. We can't pick up
a trace of her lock-on signal.

26:01.583 --> 26:04.917
The further off the lock-on
signal a ship is pulled

26:05.000 --> 26:06.500
the more distorted her signals.

26:06.583 --> 26:08.625
Now, the first message we got
from the Cortez

26:08.708 --> 26:11.625
was fairly strong,
but it's fading.

26:11.708 --> 26:13.375
So we have to move on this fast.

26:13.458 --> 26:16.792
But if we don't know where
she is, how do we find her?

26:18.208 --> 26:21.125
I have an idea on that.

26:21.208 --> 26:23.792
But it's risky.

26:23.875 --> 26:25.625
There's a strong chance that

26:25.708 --> 26:29.458
'some or all of
the rescue ships..'

26:29.542 --> 26:32.292
'...might not make it back.'

26:32.375 --> 26:37.000
We know there is a drift
in hyperspace..

26:37.083 --> 26:38.500
...that can pull
a powerless ship

26:38.583 --> 26:41.042
down the gravitational incline.

26:41.125 --> 26:42.667
The Cortez still has power.

26:42.750 --> 26:45.292
She can hold her position
a little longer.

26:45.375 --> 26:47.292
So..

26:47.375 --> 26:52.000
...we are going to borrow a page
from the lifeboat service.

26:52.083 --> 26:53.750
When a ship foundered
in bad weather they'd go out

26:53.833 --> 26:56.667
in huge dories to save
the crew and passengers.

26:56.750 --> 27:00.375
They'd form a line of lifeboats
from the ship to the shore.

27:00.458 --> 27:02.958
As a kind of lifeline.

27:03.042 --> 27:06.083
The first fighter will stop
just inside the gate

27:06.167 --> 27:07.875
and lock on to the gate signal.

27:07.958 --> 27:12.792
The second fighter will proceed
1000 kilometers further in

27:12.875 --> 27:14.667
and lock on to the signal
of the first one.

27:14.750 --> 27:16.375
The third fighter will
lock on to the signal

27:16.458 --> 27:18.208
of the second one, and so on.

27:18.292 --> 27:21.083
Which leaves the last man
hanging in midair.

27:21.167 --> 27:23.417
But if he's broadcasting a
search signal in all directions

27:23.500 --> 27:25.042
there's a chance the Cortez
will pick it up.

27:25.125 --> 27:26.500
If they're still in range.

27:26.583 --> 27:29.333
We extend the range by moving
the fighters further out

27:29.417 --> 27:31.750
like an expanding telescope.

27:33.208 --> 27:36.792
It's a long shot.

27:36.875 --> 27:39.833
But it's their only chance.

27:39.917 --> 27:41.500
Any questions?

27:41.583 --> 27:43.542
[together]
No, sir.

27:45.250 --> 27:49.167
Good. You'll hit space
in five minutes.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.958
Good luck.

27:51.042 --> 27:54.083
[intense music]

27:56.708 --> 28:00.417
I'd give anything
to be going with them right now.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.250
So would I.

28:05.042 --> 28:09.250
(Ivanova)
'Zeta Wing, commence
drop sequence check.'

28:09.333 --> 28:12.875
'Power up to standby.
Initiate drop sequence.'

28:12.958 --> 28:17.292
- Zeta Squadron.
- Zeta Squadron, standing by.

28:17.375 --> 28:19.250
An old friend of mine
once quoted me

28:19.333 --> 28:23.417
a ancient Egyptian blessing.

28:23.500 --> 28:27.417
"God be between you and harm

28:27.500 --> 28:29.917
in all the empty places
where you must walk."

28:34.083 --> 28:36.333
Bring the Cortez home.

28:36.417 --> 28:38.458
[whirring]

28:39.958 --> 28:43.000
[intense music]

28:57.417 --> 28:59.250
[whooshing]

28:59.333 --> 29:00.458
Communication status?

29:00.542 --> 29:02.125
Nothing from the Cortez now,
sir.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.292
Your message is being relayed

29:03.375 --> 29:05.000
from fighter to fighter
in hyperspace.

29:05.083 --> 29:07.708
The pilots report
no response yet.

29:07.792 --> 29:09.833
[crackling]

29:12.833 --> 29:15.958
Captain. I'm getting a signal
from Babylon 5.

29:16.042 --> 29:19.250
- It's very faint, sir.
- On speaker.

29:19.333 --> 29:21.542
(John)
'Cortez,
this is Babylon Control.'

29:21.625 --> 29:23.792
'If you can hear us,
please respond.'

29:23.875 --> 29:27.417
'We are sending help. Cortez,
this is Babylon Control.'

29:27.500 --> 29:29.667
'If you can hear us,
please respond.'

29:29.750 --> 29:31.458
Send this.

29:31.542 --> 29:35.542
'Babylon Control,
this is the Cortez.'

29:35.625 --> 29:38.333
'Babylon Control,
this is the Cortez.'

29:38.417 --> 29:40.542
'Lock on still not functioning.'

29:40.625 --> 29:42.333
Cortez, this is Babylon Control.

29:42.417 --> 29:44.500
Keep on broadcasting
your mayday.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.542
'We're homing in on it
and sending a sheepdog'

29:46.625 --> 29:48.542
'to lead you home.'

29:48.625 --> 29:50.667
[whooshing]

29:59.292 --> 30:01.583
[crackling]

30:01.667 --> 30:03.750
You got the signal, Warren?

30:05.833 --> 30:07.833
Hard to get a beat on it, sir.

30:07.917 --> 30:09.750
Radio locator
doesn't want to settle.

30:09.833 --> 30:12.292
- Keep scanning.
- 'Yes, sir.'

30:14.667 --> 30:16.750
[indistinct chatter]

30:18.417 --> 30:19.625
Alright, what's happening?

30:19.708 --> 30:21.958
It's gotten scratchy again, sir.

30:22.042 --> 30:24.000
I can't even hear
the pilots now.

30:24.083 --> 30:25.333
[sighs]

30:25.417 --> 30:27.917
Alright. Carry on.
Why don't you take a break?

30:28.000 --> 30:30.333
Why don't you? Sir.

30:33.042 --> 30:34.542
I can't.

30:36.375 --> 30:38.625
Jack's too old a friend.

30:38.708 --> 30:41.083
If this turns into a wake,
I wanna be here.

30:41.167 --> 30:44.500
Is he the one that told you
about the Egyptian blessing?

30:44.583 --> 30:46.792
Hm.

30:46.875 --> 30:48.917
He was my first
commanding officer.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.167
The old Moon-Mars Patrol
before the war.

30:53.500 --> 30:56.375
Damn, I thought he knew
everything.

30:56.458 --> 30:58.083
He did too.

30:58.167 --> 30:59.833
Captain Maynard
knows the risks he takes

30:59.917 --> 31:02.708
every time he orders
his ship out.

31:02.792 --> 31:05.708
So if it's a wake,
I'll drink with you.

31:05.792 --> 31:09.375
But until it is, why don't we
just remember that blessing?

31:09.458 --> 31:12.500
[instrumental music]

31:16.208 --> 31:18.333
[whooshing]

31:18.417 --> 31:20.833
(female #1)
'Mayday. May..
This is the Cortez.'

31:20.917 --> 31:24.083
Commander, I've got the signal.

31:24.167 --> 31:27.500
- And locking on.
- Go. I'll hold here.

31:27.583 --> 31:28.708
Yes, sir.

31:28.792 --> 31:30.833
[whooshing]

31:35.792 --> 31:37.833
[crackling]

31:39.333 --> 31:41.333
Captain, captain!

31:45.500 --> 31:48.042
I do believe
that's our sheepdog.

31:48.792 --> 31:51.458
[intense music]

31:51.542 --> 31:53.750
Keffer!

31:53.833 --> 31:55.875
[explosion]

31:57.708 --> 31:59.875
Galus!

32:03.458 --> 32:07.333
[automated message]
Navigation system inoperative.
Communication disrupted.

32:07.417 --> 32:11.125
- Engaging lateral thrusters.
- Negative function.

32:13.750 --> 32:15.750
[crackling]

32:18.500 --> 32:20.417
Where is he?
Where's the fighter?

32:20.500 --> 32:23.167
Increasing range and scanning.

32:23.250 --> 32:25.792
Scanning. Got him.

32:25.875 --> 32:28.917
[intense music]

32:31.500 --> 32:34.333
What's going on?

32:34.417 --> 32:37.292
Come on, come on.
Figure it out!

32:39.750 --> 32:43.375
What the hell's he doing?
What's he shooting at?

32:43.458 --> 32:47.208
I don't know. He keeps firing
in the same direction.

32:47.292 --> 32:49.500
But there's nothing out there.

32:50.958 --> 32:54.208
Except...the way home.

32:54.292 --> 32:56.292
He's firing in the direction
he wants us to go.

32:56.375 --> 32:59.250
- Can you calculate that?
- I'm on it.

33:00.792 --> 33:03.833
Communication to Starfury
restored.

33:03.917 --> 33:06.500
(Keffer)
'Cortez, get out of here now!'

33:06.583 --> 33:08.417
Starfury, this is the Cortez.

33:08.500 --> 33:10.375
We can come after you.
Do you copy?

33:10.458 --> 33:12.667
(Keffer)
'NAV system not functioning.
Engines down.'

33:12.750 --> 33:16.125
If you come after me
we'll both get lost. Go!

33:18.958 --> 33:20.917
Thanks, Starfury.

33:21.792 --> 33:24.125
Pat.

33:24.208 --> 33:27.125
Lay in the course.
Follow the trail.

33:27.208 --> 33:28.583
Yes, sir.

33:28.667 --> 33:31.708
[instrumental music]

33:35.458 --> 33:37.458
[zapping]

34:02.792 --> 34:04.500
- Ships coming through.
- How many?

34:04.583 --> 34:07.208
Three. No, four.

34:07.292 --> 34:10.333
[intense music]

34:25.375 --> 34:28.083
Cortez, this is Babylon Control.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.375
Where are the other two
fighters?

34:30.458 --> 34:33.667
I'm sorry, Johnny.
They didn't make it.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.042
[music continues]

34:51.625 --> 34:53.042
Nice of you to join me finally.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.833
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm late. I know.

34:54.917 --> 34:55.958
Did you get it?

34:56.042 --> 34:57.667
Look, the supply-ship
cargo master

34:57.750 --> 35:01.250
begrudged every extra ounce
of every inch of space.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.458
But I called in some favors.

35:03.542 --> 35:05.042
You're lucky I have a few
to spare, Garibaldi.

35:05.125 --> 35:07.333
Yeah, so bill me. Where is it?

35:08.833 --> 35:10.333
Bam.

35:10.417 --> 35:13.000
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Okay? Alright?

35:13.083 --> 35:16.833
So I asked myself,
now, who on the station

35:16.917 --> 35:19.333
could pull together
the ingredients of bagna cauda

35:19.417 --> 35:21.792
so far from Earth?

35:21.875 --> 35:25.583
Your qualifications precede you,
Mr. Orwell.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.708
Mr. Garibaldi.

35:29.792 --> 35:32.417
Doc.
Give me a minute.

35:37.083 --> 35:40.375
It's for my birthday. Honest.
You can check the date.

35:40.458 --> 35:43.292
Alright, it's your birthday,
so what?

35:44.625 --> 35:47.042
So..

35:47.125 --> 35:50.458
...my father always made bagna
cauda for me on my birthday.

35:50.542 --> 35:54.292
My pop was a great cook,
and bagna was his specialty.

35:54.375 --> 35:57.000
And when he used to cook it,
I mean, the smell

35:57.083 --> 36:00.792
oh, man, the smell
would fill the whole place.

36:00.875 --> 36:04.042
It's funny, you know,
when I watched him cook

36:04.125 --> 36:07.333
I knew he was doing it
because he loved me.

36:07.417 --> 36:09.250
He just could never say it.

36:09.333 --> 36:11.458
And so he did that instead.

36:13.792 --> 36:17.542
He's been gone a long time.

36:17.625 --> 36:20.000
So now I make it myself
once a year.

36:21.667 --> 36:23.750
Honoring him, you know?

36:25.917 --> 36:28.083
It's the only part of him
I got left.

36:29.500 --> 36:32.250
Well, in that case..

36:32.333 --> 36:35.875
...why don't you make
enough for two.

36:35.958 --> 36:37.500
Yeah?

36:41.833 --> 36:43.458
Captain.

36:43.542 --> 36:45.583
I can come back
if you wish to be alone.

36:45.667 --> 36:48.542
No, no, no. Please.

36:48.625 --> 36:52.333
I heard the news.
I'm sorry for your loss.

36:54.375 --> 36:56.917
That's the hard part, isn't it?

36:58.208 --> 37:01.458
Sending young people out to die.

37:01.542 --> 37:03.458
But they saved others.

37:03.542 --> 37:06.625
At the right moment,
they were in the right place

37:06.708 --> 37:10.583
and knew what to do.
As you did.

37:10.667 --> 37:15.708
What makes you think
this is the right place for me?

37:15.792 --> 37:19.958
The universe puts us in places
where we can learn.

37:20.042 --> 37:24.208
They're never easy places,
but they are right.

37:24.292 --> 37:30.333
Wherever we are is the right
place and the right time.

37:30.417 --> 37:33.667
The pain that sometimes comes..

37:33.750 --> 37:40.167
...is part of the process
of constantly being born.

37:40.250 --> 37:42.167
You sound like you've been
doing some thinking

37:42.250 --> 37:45.000
about this on your own.

37:45.083 --> 37:48.042
Perhaps.

37:48.125 --> 37:52.083
We are both, I suppose,
going through transitions.

37:53.250 --> 37:56.375
But the universe knows
what it's doing.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.583
I wish I had your faith
in the universe.

38:02.667 --> 38:04.000
[sighs]

38:04.083 --> 38:07.000
I just don't see it sometimes.

38:08.292 --> 38:11.875
Then I will tell you
a great secret, captain.

38:11.958 --> 38:15.042
Perhaps the greatest
of all time.

38:15.125 --> 38:16.875
The molecules of your body

38:16.958 --> 38:20.208
are the same molecules
that make up this station

38:20.292 --> 38:22.125
and the nebula outside

38:22.208 --> 38:25.958
that burn inside
the stars themselves.

38:26.042 --> 38:30.083
We are star stuff,
we are the universe

38:30.167 --> 38:34.750
made manifest,
trying to figure itself out.

38:34.833 --> 38:36.875
And as we have both learned

38:36.958 --> 38:42.167
sometimes the universe requires
a change of perspective.

39:09.083 --> 39:11.792
We've been through
a lot together, haven't we?

39:14.208 --> 39:16.583
Who would've thought?

39:19.125 --> 39:21.167
[intense music]

39:22.500 --> 39:26.792
Computer, analyze flight path
of unknown object.

39:26.875 --> 39:30.167
- Correlate to last sighting.
- 'Stand by.'

39:34.292 --> 39:36.250
Sorry, captain.

39:57.875 --> 39:59.833
Permission granted.

39:59.917 --> 40:03.042
- Welcome home.
- Thank you, sir.

40:04.125 --> 40:07.208
[instrumental music]

40:16.375 --> 40:20.625
Commander Galus. The best
squadron leader I ever had.

40:20.708 --> 40:22.833
- To Galus.
- To Galus.

40:25.042 --> 40:27.333
So, lieutenant,
do you have any idea at all

40:27.417 --> 40:29.583
what caused the disruption
that nearly wrecked you?

40:29.667 --> 40:31.000
And saved me.

40:31.083 --> 40:33.208
When I saw it again,
just for a second

40:33.292 --> 40:35.333
I figured it must be riding
its lock-on

40:35.417 --> 40:36.667
even though the direction
was nothing

40:36.750 --> 40:39.083
like I've ever seen before.

40:39.167 --> 40:40.458
'When it came through
the first time'

40:40.542 --> 40:42.833
it was on a right angle
to the gates position.

40:42.917 --> 40:44.708
Once I figured that out,
I just struck out

40:44.792 --> 40:47.417
in what seemed
like the right direction.

40:47.500 --> 40:51.167
As for what it was,
I don't know.

40:52.500 --> 40:54.500
'There was just this feeling
that something'

40:54.583 --> 40:57.250
'dark and dangerous
had gone by.'

40:57.333 --> 40:58.417
You know that feeling,
like somebody

40:58.500 --> 41:00.917
just walked on your grave?

41:01.042 --> 41:02.792
That's the only way
I can describe it.

41:02.875 --> 41:04.542
(Jack)
'This feeling that something's
out there.'

41:04.625 --> 41:07.375
You just never forget it.

41:07.458 --> 41:08.792
I wanna know what it is.

41:08.875 --> 41:11.542
I'm sure we'll find out
one of these days.

41:11.625 --> 41:13.042
At the moment,
that investigation

41:13.125 --> 41:14.875
isn't our first order
of business.

41:14.958 --> 41:17.417
There is one other.

41:17.500 --> 41:20.542
Lieutenant, I know this isn't
a very good time for this

41:20.625 --> 41:23.917
but Zeta Squadron
needs a new commander.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.208
I've decided to give it to you.

41:26.292 --> 41:27.917
Congratulations.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
Say, uh, isn't John
supposed to be here?

41:31.083 --> 41:34.083
Yes, he is. That reminds me,
where's Garibaldi?

41:37.500 --> 41:41.167
Trust me, doc.
You are gonna love this.

41:41.250 --> 41:42.500
I can feel my arteries hardening

41:42.583 --> 41:45.208
just being in the same room
with it.

41:48.250 --> 41:50.167
Alright.

41:52.250 --> 41:54.792
- That's good.
- Mm-hm. Told you.

41:56.167 --> 41:59.417
- That is very good.
- Hm! You think that's good.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.125
- Wait till dessert.
- Now, wait a minute.

42:01.208 --> 42:03.625
- I didn't authorize dessert.
- No?

42:03.708 --> 42:05.958
- Then you can't have any.
- What is it?

42:06.042 --> 42:07.250
Doesn't matter.
You're not getting any.

42:07.333 --> 42:08.958
No, no, no.
L-let's not be hasty.

42:09.042 --> 42:12.042
No, no, no, no, no. Too late.

42:12.125 --> 42:15.083
This is great.

42:15.167 --> 42:18.083
I see you're hard at it, sir.

42:18.167 --> 42:20.583
I've decided it's time
to get back to work.

42:20.667 --> 42:22.792
The station doesn't run itself.

42:22.875 --> 42:24.417
Captain Maynard,
Lieutenant Keffer

42:24.500 --> 42:26.042
and the rest of the pilots
would like you to join them

42:26.125 --> 42:27.375
in the officers club.

42:27.458 --> 42:28.625
Okay, give me an hour,

42:28.708 --> 42:30.333
and I'll have everything
under control here.

42:30.417 --> 42:31.333
Yes, sir.

42:31.417 --> 42:32.417
'Ever had a long talk'

42:32.500 --> 42:35.125
with Ambassador Delenn,
commander?

42:35.208 --> 42:38.458
From time to time. Why?

42:38.542 --> 42:40.750
She and the universe

42:40.833 --> 42:44.292
seem to have
a special relationship.

42:44.375 --> 42:46.167
Don't we all?
