01:17.585 --> 01:19.143
- American.

01:19.187 --> 01:20.347
Coca-Cola.

01:20.388 --> 01:21.412
You like.

02:00.294 --> 02:02.592
- John Jason Wilde.

02:02.630 --> 02:03.654
- Jake.

02:03.698 --> 02:06.496
Friends call me Jake.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.197
- Mr. Wilde,

02:10.238 --> 02:12.103
I'm Lieutenant Hashim.

02:12.140 --> 02:14.040
Detachment 88.

02:16.043 --> 02:18.443
You've not heard of us
in America?

02:19.780 --> 02:21.270
We're not all...

02:22.350 --> 02:23.408
Terrorists.

02:26.220 --> 02:27.687
Begin.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.188
- I was there maybe an hour.

02:31.225 --> 02:32.214
<i>- Allahu akbar!</i>

02:33.327 --> 02:35.158
- Wait.

02:35.196 --> 02:36.891
Begin with...

02:36.931 --> 02:38.523
how you came to my country.

02:38.566 --> 02:41.433
- Look, I'm a grad school TA

02:41.469 --> 02:43.664
on a fellowship program
from Cornell University...

02:43.704 --> 02:44.932
Cornell.

02:44.972 --> 02:46.269
The Ivy League?

02:46.307 --> 02:47.433
In America?

02:47.475 --> 02:50.842
Here to do a panel on fucking
Southeast Asian art history.

02:53.514 --> 02:54.811
- A teaching assistant?

02:54.849 --> 02:56.373
- Yeah.

02:56.417 --> 02:57.577
- Do you...

02:58.886 --> 03:01.946
Lecture to your students
with that language?

03:01.989 --> 03:03.718
- You should hear
what they call me.

03:05.593 --> 03:06.958
<i>- Lanjutkan.</i>

03:09.530 --> 03:10.792
Continue.

03:15.469 --> 03:16.936
- I flew in last week.

03:17.939 --> 03:20.464
Then they invited me to this...

03:20.508 --> 03:22.840
party.

03:22.877 --> 03:24.276
They said formal.

03:24.312 --> 03:27.042
I didn't realize it was, like,
Hawaiian shirt night.

03:27.081 --> 03:28.810
- Batik.

03:28.849 --> 03:30.749
It's called batik.

03:30.785 --> 03:31.979
- Right.

03:32.019 --> 03:33.543
- Did you speak with anyone?

03:33.588 --> 03:35.385
- I don't know anyone here.

03:52.773 --> 03:55.264
I hit on a pretty girl.
So?

03:55.309 --> 03:56.640
- Our...

03:56.677 --> 03:59.111
Princess Diana.

03:59.146 --> 04:03.310
You were the last to speak
to the sultana of Java

04:03.351 --> 04:04.909
before she died.

04:06.220 --> 04:07.812
Now...

04:07.855 --> 04:12.121
you will tell me every detail.

04:24.071 --> 04:25.436
- Wow.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.839
Those are beautiful.

04:28.843 --> 04:30.174
- Excuse me?

04:30.211 --> 04:31.838
- The diamonds...

04:31.879 --> 04:34.279
Khmer Royal Treasury.

04:34.315 --> 04:35.543
Am I right?

04:35.583 --> 04:37.483
- You know jewelry.

04:37.518 --> 04:38.644
- I know beauty.

04:38.686 --> 04:41.052
- Sultana, your speech?

04:41.088 --> 04:42.316
- A pleasure to meet you,
mister...

04:42.356 --> 04:43.687
- Wilde.

04:43.724 --> 04:44.986
Call me Jake.

04:45.026 --> 04:46.084
- Mr. Jake.

04:49.630 --> 04:53.361
- So...
you just...

04:53.401 --> 04:55.369
hit...

04:55.403 --> 04:56.529
on her.

04:56.570 --> 04:59.505
- She was the prettiest girl
at the party.

05:01.809 --> 05:03.470
That's where you start.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.944
Then you work your way down.

05:04.979 --> 05:07.379
- The sultana is the...

05:10.751 --> 05:13.447
Was...

05:13.487 --> 05:15.751
the most revered woman

05:15.790 --> 05:17.018
in my country.

05:21.796 --> 05:24.424
You may go.

05:24.465 --> 05:27.127
Just fill out
this witness report.

05:52.927 --> 05:54.407
<i>The bule never asked</i>

05:54.428 --> 05:55.486
<i>for his embassy.</i>

05:55.529 --> 05:56.689
<i>- I know.</i>

05:58.499 --> 06:00.660
<i>- No bule would do that.</i>

06:03.104 --> 06:06.096
<i>- A bule who knows about
our crown jewels</i>

06:06.140 --> 06:08.370
<i>but doesn't know to wear batik
to our formal events.</i>

06:11.479 --> 06:12.605
<i>- He's lying.</i>

06:13.814 --> 06:14.803
<i>- I know.</i>

06:16.317 --> 06:17.841
<i>- You're keeping the general
waiting.</i>

06:19.553 --> 06:22.818
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>

06:44.111 --> 06:45.203
<i>General, Sir.</i>

06:45.246 --> 06:46.372
- English.

06:48.149 --> 06:50.083
Where have you been?

06:50.117 --> 06:52.711
- Sorry, <i>pak,</i> but every witness
must be thoroughly...

06:52.753 --> 06:55.449
- My men tell me
that there are a dozen links

06:55.489 --> 06:58.822
between this bombing
and the Malaysian fanatic

06:58.859 --> 07:01.350
Faruq Al'Assan.

07:01.395 --> 07:05.263
- Faruq is far too politically
sophisticated for this.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.995
- I need someone to string up
for the media.

07:08.035 --> 07:11.004
And in absence of Faruq,
you will do.

07:11.038 --> 07:13.734
- I'll be sure to mention your
thoroughness to my superiors.

08:23.978 --> 08:25.673
- Mas Jake!

08:25.713 --> 08:26.680
- Hey.

08:26.714 --> 08:28.739
Uh... Nita?

08:28.782 --> 08:30.613
- Yes.

08:30.651 --> 08:33.279
Notes for your section.

08:36.190 --> 08:37.953
- They killed her, you know?

08:39.293 --> 08:41.227
- What?

08:41.261 --> 08:43.559
- She'd have been
the first female sultan.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.775
So much for Muslim hospitality.

08:56.810 --> 08:58.869
- I'm Christian, <i>bule.</i>

08:58.913 --> 09:01.245
<i>- Take off his handcuffs.</i>

09:07.855 --> 09:09.186
<i>"Bule"?</i>

09:10.224 --> 09:11.748
Shit.

09:11.792 --> 09:13.225
- Literally,

09:13.260 --> 09:16.195
"stupid white person,"

09:16.230 --> 09:18.892
but it can be
a term of endearment.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.628
- Yeah, right.

09:26.206 --> 09:27.798
- The bomber stood here, yes?

09:30.511 --> 09:31.535
- Um...

09:31.579 --> 09:33.240
- Think, Mr. Wilde.

09:44.358 --> 09:45.791
- Yeah.

09:45.826 --> 09:47.794
He stood there.

09:56.770 --> 09:59.432
- And the sultana?

09:59.473 --> 10:00.838
She was here?

10:00.874 --> 10:02.136
- Yeah, but...

10:02.176 --> 10:03.541
- But you couldn't see

10:03.577 --> 10:04.942
because of the screen.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.606
- Yeah.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.945
- And you?

10:08.983 --> 10:11.076
You were here?

10:11.118 --> 10:13.518
- No, I was...

10:13.554 --> 10:14.646
I was here.

10:17.691 --> 10:20.353
- You had a clear view
of the bomber.

10:20.394 --> 10:21.452
What did you see?

10:21.495 --> 10:23.554
- He held his hands up

10:23.597 --> 10:24.962
and then shouted...

10:24.999 --> 10:27.399
- Mr. Wilde, Allah gave you
two eyes and one mouth

10:27.434 --> 10:30.597
so that you might see
twice as much as you speak.

10:30.638 --> 10:32.799
So please, what did you see?

10:32.840 --> 10:33.829
- I told you.

10:33.874 --> 10:34.863
I heard him scream,

10:34.908 --> 10:35.932
and then he blew the whole...

10:35.976 --> 10:37.068
- No.

10:37.111 --> 10:39.944
What did you see?

10:53.827 --> 10:55.988
- His hands were empty.

10:58.198 --> 11:01.793
Someone else
detonated the bomb.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.132
How did I miss that?

11:03.170 --> 11:04.637
- No doubt not part
of your training

11:04.672 --> 11:06.537
in Southeast Asian studies.

11:06.573 --> 11:08.734
- Art history.

11:08.776 --> 11:10.209
- Yes.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.406
- Who was this?

11:17.751 --> 11:19.412
- The sultana.

11:21.055 --> 11:23.285
- This is where you found
the sultana?

11:25.025 --> 11:26.390
- Indeed.

11:28.429 --> 11:31.921
Odd that her body was blown
toward the explosion.

11:33.801 --> 11:35.428
One more stop.

12:08.702 --> 12:10.932
The prettiest girl at the party.

12:16.009 --> 12:18.443
- Do you want to become
a permanent guest here?

12:22.816 --> 12:24.477
Perhaps...

12:24.518 --> 12:25.678
it is less painful for you

12:25.719 --> 12:27.209
to wait outside, Pak Vizier.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.293
Did you know...

12:37.731 --> 12:40.723
It's a grave sin in Islam
to mark one's own flesh?

12:44.004 --> 12:46.802
- And what's the Koran say about
a woman piercing her clit?

12:46.840 --> 12:48.364
- Excuse me?

12:53.914 --> 12:55.142
I see.

12:56.350 --> 12:58.818
- She's also had a nose job.

12:58.852 --> 13:01.320
Implants.

13:01.355 --> 13:03.186
This isn't the sultana.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.358
- How can you know that?

13:07.394 --> 13:09.362
- Trust me.
I know women.

13:09.396 --> 13:11.023
- Yes.

13:11.064 --> 13:12.122
You know beauty.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.157
- I met the lady.

13:15.435 --> 13:17.960
- It's time for us to leave.

13:48.435 --> 13:49.800
<i>Peace be with you.</i>

13:49.837 --> 13:51.099
<i>- And to you.</i>

13:52.873 --> 13:53.840
The police...

13:53.874 --> 13:55.569
- Wait, wait, wait.
Shh-shh.

13:55.609 --> 13:58.601
Hey, boy, get some candy.

14:05.919 --> 14:08.149
- A detective
returned to the site...

14:09.156 --> 14:10.953
And a <i>bule.</i>

14:10.991 --> 14:14.290
I think... English.

14:18.999 --> 14:20.626
- American.

14:22.536 --> 14:23.867
- You know him?

14:28.942 --> 14:30.603
- He's grown out his hair.

14:32.045 --> 14:34.536
Brings out his eyes, no?

14:34.581 --> 14:36.572
- This is not a game.

14:36.617 --> 14:38.244
- Of course it is.

14:39.653 --> 14:41.177
<i>Smile, my friend.</i>

14:41.221 --> 14:44.588
<i>Another enemy of Islam
into your hands.</i>

14:46.994 --> 14:48.791
Ah, look at you.

14:48.829 --> 14:50.126
I can't take you anywhere.

14:59.573 --> 15:00.904
- So who's the dead girl?

15:02.910 --> 15:04.571
How do you eat that shit?

15:04.611 --> 15:06.511
You ever hear of trans fats?

15:06.546 --> 15:07.843
Glutens?

15:07.881 --> 15:09.280
Whoa!

15:09.316 --> 15:10.283
- Nasi goreng.

15:10.317 --> 15:12.080
Fried rice.
Good for you.

15:13.153 --> 15:15.246
So where are we going?

15:15.289 --> 15:17.757
- There is no "we."

15:17.791 --> 15:18.951
- Come on, Hash.

15:18.992 --> 15:20.084
We kicked ass in there!

15:21.795 --> 15:23.387
- Americans...

15:23.430 --> 15:24.988
You are like children,

15:25.032 --> 15:27.398
always thinking you are Rambo.

15:27.434 --> 15:29.061
- You know Rambo?

15:29.102 --> 15:30.899
"I always thought

15:30.938 --> 15:33.930
the mind
was the best defense."

15:33.974 --> 15:35.771
- "Weapon."

15:35.809 --> 15:37.470
- What?

15:37.511 --> 15:39.308
- It's...

15:39.346 --> 15:41.576
"I always thought the mind
was the best weapon."

15:42.816 --> 15:43.840
- See?

15:43.884 --> 15:46.114
That's why we make a good team.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.245
You know you can trust me.

15:47.287 --> 15:48.914
- Hmm, yes.

15:48.956 --> 15:51.151
That's why you're sitting
in the back.

16:18.318 --> 16:20.047
Hash?

16:20.087 --> 16:21.076
Hash?

16:34.868 --> 16:36.392
<i>- God is great.</i>

16:36.436 --> 16:37.596
<i>- God is great.</i>

18:02.022 --> 18:03.182
- Hash.

18:22.876 --> 18:24.605
- Anton.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.614
- You saved my husband's life.

18:28.648 --> 18:30.616
- It was nothing, ma'am.

18:30.650 --> 18:32.015
I'm Jake.

18:34.387 --> 18:35.979
- Mas Hashim!

18:40.060 --> 18:42.858
Mas Jake will come to our house
for breakfast.

18:42.896 --> 18:44.090
- Thanks, ma'am, but I...

18:44.131 --> 18:45.359
I really should be getting back.

18:45.398 --> 18:47.730
- Yes, your students
will miss you.

18:48.969 --> 18:50.630
- It's the least we can do.

18:51.738 --> 18:52.898
- She's right.

18:55.942 --> 18:57.967
- Do you take sugar?

18:59.079 --> 19:00.171
- No, thanks.

19:02.149 --> 19:03.207
This is very good, ma'am.

19:04.851 --> 19:06.341
- Nasi goreng.

19:06.386 --> 19:07.876
Gluten-free.

19:10.657 --> 19:14.457
- Tell us about your studies,
Mas Jake.

19:14.494 --> 19:16.519
- <i>"Mas"</i> is Javanese
for "brother."

19:18.165 --> 19:19.689
- Where'd you learn
such good English?

19:19.733 --> 19:22.463
<i>Go get ready.</i>

19:22.502 --> 19:24.902
Vitria went to university.

19:24.938 --> 19:26.132
And grad school.

19:28.208 --> 19:29.698
- You're a lucky man.

19:29.743 --> 19:31.210
- Indeed.

19:33.780 --> 19:37.147
<i>Budi, Ade, are you ready?</i>

19:45.792 --> 19:47.054
- Yeah.

19:49.029 --> 19:51.327
Within family,
we don't shake hands.

19:51.364 --> 19:54.128
It shows a deeper affection.

19:57.270 --> 19:59.636
- Strange country.

19:59.673 --> 20:01.903
Another man can kiss your wife
in public.

20:01.942 --> 20:03.307
- But I cannot.

20:03.343 --> 20:04.867
- Strange country.

20:04.911 --> 20:06.401
- Strange that
you did not learn this

20:06.446 --> 20:08.038
in Southeast Asian studies.

20:09.716 --> 20:10.808
- Art history.

20:11.785 --> 20:12.843
- Mm.

20:15.989 --> 20:17.820
I want to thank you.

20:17.857 --> 20:19.654
- It was nothing.

20:21.194 --> 20:22.525
- It was something.

20:24.698 --> 20:27.565
This shooting...

20:27.601 --> 20:29.762
This you learn in art history?

20:32.572 --> 20:34.563
- Just lucky, I guess.

20:41.881 --> 20:44.145
- Even here, we have internet,
you know?

20:44.184 --> 20:45.947
Wi-Fi.

20:47.287 --> 20:50.279
Vitria found something
that you might like to see.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.654
There.

20:54.694 --> 20:56.491
<i>- Hi, everyone.
I'm John Jason Wilde.</i>

20:56.529 --> 20:58.497
<i>And today we'll be discussing
ancient Javanese art</i>

20:58.531 --> 21:00.158
<i>in contemporary literature...</i>

21:06.506 --> 21:07.996
- Your country lectures us

21:08.041 --> 21:10.441
about cooperation
in the war on terror.

21:12.345 --> 21:14.438
But since 9/11,

21:14.481 --> 21:18.178
we have caught twice as many
terrorists as you,

21:18.218 --> 21:20.948
Mr. Not-So-Wilde.

21:22.389 --> 21:26.018
Interpol shows your fingerprints
at bomb sites in Baghdad,

21:26.059 --> 21:27.686
Kabul, and Beirut.

21:30.597 --> 21:32.064
- I've been tracking
this terror cell

21:32.098 --> 21:33.690
for the last two years.

21:33.733 --> 21:35.462
I'm close, Hash,

21:35.502 --> 21:37.595
real close.

21:37.637 --> 21:41.403
- And no one at your FBI
informed our agencies here?

21:41.441 --> 21:43.238
- They didn't trust you people.

21:43.276 --> 21:45.267
- Because we are Muslim?

21:45.312 --> 21:47.109
- Because when we talk to you,

21:47.147 --> 21:49.342
we're not sure
who we're talking to.

21:49.382 --> 21:51.179
- Indeed.

21:51.217 --> 21:55.278
- And because we're not allowed
to operate outside U.S. soil.

21:55.322 --> 21:57.517
That's why you can't tell
the embassy,

21:57.557 --> 22:00.526
or it'll ruin
two years of work.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.494
- Nor can I check your story.

22:02.529 --> 22:05.828
- Look, Hash, this is my case.

22:09.135 --> 22:11.933
- And this is my country.

22:11.971 --> 22:14.303
And what I should do now

22:14.341 --> 22:19.210
is elevate you from bad witness
to good suspect.

22:32.592 --> 22:34.025
<i>- Are you crazy?</i>

22:35.895 --> 22:38.921
<i>- The general is a nationalist.</i>

22:38.965 --> 22:43.993
<i>If he learns we've involved
an American, a spy...</i>

22:44.037 --> 22:46.631
<i>- Jesus and Mary protect us.</i>

22:46.673 --> 22:47.901
<i>- God willing.</i>

23:16.169 --> 23:18.797
Hey, Travers.

23:18.838 --> 23:19.862
- Did it come through?

23:19.906 --> 23:21.601
<i>- Hold your horses, man.</i>

23:24.477 --> 23:26.138
<i>What you got here, Jake?</i>

23:26.179 --> 23:28.010
<i>Tiger?</i>

23:28.047 --> 23:31.244
<i>It's a tattoo from a vic.</i>

23:31.284 --> 23:32.615
<i>- I'll run it through
the system,</i>

23:32.652 --> 23:34.119
<i>but I can't promise anything.</i>

23:34.154 --> 23:37.089
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're even.</i>

23:37.123 --> 23:38.317
<i>- No, we're not.</i>

23:38.358 --> 23:39.723
<i>They're all over me
to find you...</i>

23:39.759 --> 23:41.021
<i>the brass, your folks.</i>

23:42.495 --> 23:43.723
<i>- Will you...</i>

23:45.198 --> 23:46.460
Check in on 'em for me?

23:46.499 --> 23:48.899
<i>- Yeah.
I'll add it to the list.</i>

23:48.935 --> 23:50.562
<i>One more thing.</i>

23:50.603 --> 23:53.231
<i>Don't tell the cops over there
a fucking thing.</i>

23:53.273 --> 23:54.934
<i>They're all dirty
in that country.</i>

23:54.974 --> 23:57.738
<i>Semper Fi, brother.</i>

23:57.777 --> 23:59.074
- Semper Fi.

24:09.389 --> 24:11.949
<i>We can't trust him, brother.</i>

24:11.991 --> 24:14.152
<i>- He has information we don't.</i>

24:16.763 --> 24:19.596
<i>- He didn't save you
because he loves you...</i>

24:19.632 --> 24:22.260
<i>only because he needs you.</i>

24:22.302 --> 24:24.202
<i>- Better that way.</i>

24:24.237 --> 24:25.226
<i>Trust me.</i>

24:27.140 --> 24:29.700
<i>- The general wants you.</i>

24:49.662 --> 24:52.187
- My American, he lives.

24:57.737 --> 25:00.035
What a persistent boy he is.

25:00.073 --> 25:01.233
Superb.

25:02.242 --> 25:05.040
- Two of my men were killed.

25:05.078 --> 25:07.603
- Martyrs to Allah.

25:07.647 --> 25:10.445
- Yes, we will remember
their sacrifice,

25:10.483 --> 25:12.974
but who will remember you?

25:14.921 --> 25:16.252
- That boy will.

25:17.824 --> 25:19.519
- You defile all you touch!

25:19.559 --> 25:23.689
- Like you, I pick them
out of the dirt.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.220
And I cleanse them,

25:25.265 --> 25:27.859
and I bring them
into the light.

25:27.901 --> 25:32.531
The cendrawasih,
for 2,000 years,

25:32.572 --> 25:35.700
men have killed
for her feathers.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.334
I found her in New Guinea

25:37.377 --> 25:39.345
in a cesspool.

25:39.379 --> 25:41.370
It's the poorest place
on Earth.

25:45.919 --> 25:49.719
- Me and my men will take
no part of this anymore.

25:49.756 --> 25:50.745
- Eh.

25:55.995 --> 25:57.792
Don't play the innocent,
Achmed.

25:57.830 --> 26:01.129
- You said we would be fighting
a holy war,

26:01.167 --> 26:02.600
not this!

26:02.635 --> 26:04.603
- Get into bed with a snake,

26:04.637 --> 26:06.798
don't be surprised
when you are bitten.

26:08.274 --> 26:10.799
You got what you wanted.

26:10.843 --> 26:12.868
Now you help me get
what I came for.

26:18.885 --> 26:19.943
<i>- Pak?</i>

26:19.986 --> 26:21.078
- Where's your partner?

26:21.120 --> 26:22.587
- Uh, Sergeant Anton
is following a lead.

26:22.622 --> 26:24.055
- Oh, no, your American partner.

26:24.090 --> 26:25.970
- He's a valuable witness, <i>pak.</i>
I think he may...

26:25.992 --> 26:28.688
- No longer necessary.

26:28.728 --> 26:29.752
We got our man.

26:29.796 --> 26:31.696
- What? Who?

26:31.731 --> 26:32.857
- Faruq Al'Assan.

26:32.899 --> 26:33.957
We found him.

26:54.954 --> 26:56.421
<i>Faruq Al'Assan!</i>

26:56.456 --> 26:58.515
<i>You are surrounded.</i>

26:58.558 --> 27:01.789
<i>This is the chief of police!</i>

27:01.828 --> 27:03.853
<i>Give yourself up!
This is your last chance!</i>

27:08.801 --> 27:10.325
<i>Faruq Al'Assan!</i>

27:26.986 --> 27:30.012
CNN, BBC, YouTube...

27:30.056 --> 27:32.820
Even Twitter.

27:43.302 --> 27:44.564
- You're going to kill him.

28:01.220 --> 28:02.915
<i>Lieutenant Hashim!</i>

28:02.955 --> 28:04.320
<i>Come back here!</i>

29:37.483 --> 29:40.179
Get back!
Get back!

29:42.889 --> 29:43.981
Faruq Al'Assan...

29:45.725 --> 29:46.714
You're under arrest.

29:55.568 --> 29:56.626
<i>- Shoot him!</i>

29:59.806 --> 30:02.240
- Where's the sultana, Faruq?

30:02.275 --> 30:03.936
- Sultana?

30:06.846 --> 30:08.575
- Hands up!
I will shoot!

30:21.527 --> 30:23.154
Wait.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.061
Wait.
You don't have to do this.

30:29.869 --> 30:33.498
<i>- Allahu akbar!</i>

31:57.323 --> 31:58.290
- Yeah?

31:58.324 --> 32:00.224
<i>- Got something, brother.</i>

32:00.259 --> 32:02.386
<i>That tiger isn't a tattoo.</i>

32:02.428 --> 32:05.090
<i>It's a brand,
used by the Tongs.</i>

32:05.131 --> 32:06.996
- Chinese?

32:07.033 --> 32:08.500
<i>- But this particular
tiger brand</i>

32:08.534 --> 32:10.525
<i>is for their working gals.</i>

32:10.569 --> 32:12.002
- Hookers?

32:12.038 --> 32:13.958
<i>- Yeah, Tongs like to brand
their best performers</i>

32:13.973 --> 32:15.941
<i>like prize cattle.</i>

32:15.975 --> 32:18.273
<i>Send them to Thailand
for body sculpting...</i>

32:18.311 --> 32:19.972
<i>ass, tits, face.</i>

32:20.012 --> 32:22.173
<i>Turn 'em into, like,
hooker royalty.</i>

32:23.883 --> 32:25.578
- Thanks, Jimbo.

32:25.618 --> 32:27.711
<i>- Semper Fi, brother.</i>

33:34.086 --> 33:36.111
- Hey.

33:37.423 --> 33:39.050
- Hi, mister!

33:39.091 --> 33:41.116
- No, thanks, I'm trying
to find something.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.355
<i>- No, no, no, no!
No, Mister doesn't want!</i>

33:43.396 --> 33:45.296
<i>Mister doesn't want!</i>

33:47.099 --> 33:49.067
- Maybe later.
<i>- Twilight! Twilight!</i>

33:49.101 --> 33:51.228
<i>- Twilight?</i>
He doesn't want <i>Twilight!</i>

33:52.905 --> 33:55.032
Mister, mister.
Let me introduce myself.

33:55.074 --> 33:56.632
I'm Andi.
- Andi.

33:56.675 --> 33:58.302
- I know everything.
I know everyone.

33:58.344 --> 33:59.470
I show you.
Come on!

34:01.080 --> 34:02.604
You want... you want girl,
pretty girl?

34:02.648 --> 34:04.013
- Uh, not right now.

34:04.050 --> 34:05.915
- Oh, boy, boy, you want boy.

34:05.951 --> 34:07.782
- Oh, ho, no.
- Oh, of course, no boy!

34:07.820 --> 34:09.549
No boy for you.

34:09.588 --> 34:14.581
- Um, look, I'm looking
for something special.

34:14.627 --> 34:16.025
- Oh, special.

34:16.062 --> 34:17.859
<i>Waria!
- Waria?</i>

34:17.897 --> 34:18.955
- Yeah, <i>waria!</i>
Come on!

34:18.998 --> 34:20.625
- Does that...
does that mean "tiger"?

34:20.666 --> 34:22.793
- No!
<i>Waria,</i> very special!

34:22.835 --> 34:25.167
Huh?

34:25.204 --> 34:27.831
Lady boy! Lady boy!
Very pretty.

34:27.873 --> 34:30.068
- Uh, Andi...
- I know you love them.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.871
- Not my type.
Not my type.

34:31.911 --> 34:33.378
Thanks, though.

34:33.411 --> 34:35.208
Definitely not my type.

34:35.246 --> 34:37.237
<i>- Pak, pak,</i> what do you like?
I find!

34:38.451 --> 34:40.418
- Look, uh...

34:40.453 --> 34:42.512
Check this out.

34:42.554 --> 34:45.319
I'm looking for something
like that.

34:47.326 --> 34:48.520
- Tiger ladies.

34:48.561 --> 34:49.891
- Tiger ladies.
- Tiger ladies.

35:23.963 --> 35:25.590
- Andi!

35:25.631 --> 35:27.690
Ah, thank you.

35:27.733 --> 35:29.428
That one is for you.

35:29.468 --> 35:30.662
- Oh, sorry, <i>pak.</i>
Muslim.

35:30.703 --> 35:31.931
Cannot liquor.

35:37.243 --> 35:39.973
- So where are these
tiger ladies?

35:40.012 --> 35:41.036
- Second floor.

35:41.080 --> 35:43.207
Andi cannot go.

35:43.249 --> 35:44.341
Foreigners only.

35:44.383 --> 35:45.873
- Here you go.

35:45.918 --> 35:48.011
- Oh, thank you, <i>pak.</i>

36:08.674 --> 36:11.108
<i>- Leave me be, whore!</i>

36:54.620 --> 36:55.917
<i>The jihadist...</i>

36:55.955 --> 36:57.752
<i>- You found him yet?</i>

36:57.790 --> 37:00.020
<i>I want the other half
of my fucking money!</i>

37:00.059 --> 37:02.892
<i>That raghead motherfucker.</i>

37:02.928 --> 37:05.761
<i>I bet he's halfway to Pakistan!</i>

37:10.269 --> 37:11.736
<i>- He's here.</i>

37:18.143 --> 37:21.112
- Mister Yoshiro busy.

37:21.146 --> 37:22.704
- So am I.

37:22.748 --> 37:25.410
- CEO busy!

37:27.119 --> 37:29.110
- Ahso.

37:36.095 --> 37:37.824
Relax.

37:39.031 --> 37:40.430
I'm here to see her.

37:40.466 --> 37:42.491
- You just blew a big deal
for me.

37:47.906 --> 37:49.965
- Money...
- Come on.

37:50.009 --> 37:51.772
- Money.

37:51.810 --> 37:52.936
- Come on.

37:58.884 --> 38:00.476
<i>Bule dog...</i>

38:00.519 --> 38:03.044
<i>Always our women!</i>

38:16.001 --> 38:17.025
<i>- There!</i>

38:19.772 --> 38:22.104
- Oh.
Whoa.

38:43.595 --> 38:44.584
- Oh!

39:07.119 --> 39:09.781
Oh, you shy boy.

39:29.908 --> 39:32.934
- What is this made out of?

39:32.978 --> 39:36.038
It's, like, the softest material
I've ever felt.

39:37.182 --> 39:38.911
Is this silk?

39:38.951 --> 39:40.509
Or, like, Lycra?

39:40.552 --> 39:43.146
Like Lycra?
Like, like...

39:43.188 --> 39:44.815
That sounds funny, doesn't it?

39:44.857 --> 39:47.257
You felt this shit?
Felt like...

39:50.596 --> 39:52.587
You got to pay first, mister.

39:54.333 --> 39:55.561
See this?

39:57.903 --> 39:59.894
Means you have to pay big,
yeah?

40:07.713 --> 40:10.341
- Where'd you get that, babe?

40:10.382 --> 40:13.613
- It's a gift.

40:13.652 --> 40:16.052
- You... you know a girl
who has one on her thigh?

40:19.124 --> 40:21.615
You do.

40:21.660 --> 40:22.991
Who is she?

40:24.563 --> 40:26.190
- Why?

40:30.436 --> 40:32.427
Do you wanna...

40:32.471 --> 40:35.872
fuck her...

40:35.908 --> 40:37.068
or me?

40:56.728 --> 40:58.355
Hey!
- Look.

40:58.397 --> 41:00.194
- Come here!
- Calm down.

41:00.232 --> 41:02.393
I need you to tell me

41:02.434 --> 41:05.062
about the girl with
the tiger brand on her thigh.

41:05.103 --> 41:06.365
- What the fuck?

41:06.405 --> 41:08.066
- How do you know her?

41:08.106 --> 41:09.733
- She's my sister!

41:11.243 --> 41:12.835
- Your what?
Your sister?

41:14.546 --> 41:15.740
- Just let me go!

41:15.781 --> 41:17.646
Ling's gonna kill you!
Come here!

41:17.683 --> 41:19.310
- Where the fuck
is your sister now?

41:20.385 --> 41:22.216
They sent her to Thailand,
okay?

41:25.023 --> 41:26.650
- Thailand?

41:26.692 --> 41:29.160
- She's got this real good gig,

41:29.194 --> 41:31.059
classy guy.

41:31.096 --> 41:32.324
Rich.

41:33.632 --> 41:34.758
- Is the guy Arab?

41:36.602 --> 41:38.331
European?
Chinese?

41:38.370 --> 41:40.099
French? American?
Russian?

41:40.138 --> 41:42.936
- No!
Just <i>bule!</i>

41:42.975 --> 41:44.442
They're all the same like you.

42:33.025 --> 42:34.083
Fuck!

42:49.107 --> 42:50.540
- Try to fuck Ling, Achmed!

42:52.210 --> 42:54.007
Me?

42:54.046 --> 42:56.378
Where's Ling's money,
you raghead motherfucker?

42:58.617 --> 43:00.209
Where's my motherfucking girl?

43:00.252 --> 43:03.085
<i>There is no God but Allah.</i>

43:03.121 --> 43:04.349
- They killed her, Ling!

43:04.389 --> 43:06.516
They blew her up!

43:15.701 --> 43:17.464
- Now they've killed her sister!

43:19.538 --> 43:21.597
- You killed my tiger ladies,
Achmed!

43:24.343 --> 43:25.867
You not think Ling
will come for you?

43:27.579 --> 43:29.570
<i>- Polisi!</i>
Detachment 88.

43:31.516 --> 43:34.314
- Police?
I own the police!

44:11.657 --> 44:14.285
- Who'd you sell the girl to?

44:14.326 --> 44:16.487
- Fuck you!

44:16.528 --> 44:19.190
- Who'd you sell the girl to?

44:19.231 --> 44:21.461
No, no, no, no, no.
There's another guy!

44:21.500 --> 44:22.489
The white guy!

44:22.534 --> 44:24.331
- What you gonna do, cop, huh?

44:24.369 --> 44:26.098
Read him his rights?

44:26.138 --> 44:27.264
- Give me his fuckin' name

44:27.305 --> 44:28.585
and I'll kill
the son of a bitch.

44:31.343 --> 44:36.975
- Malik.
His name is Malik.

44:37.015 --> 44:39.506
- Where, Ling?

44:39.551 --> 44:41.451
Where can I find him, Ling?

44:41.486 --> 44:43.147
- Don't worry, cop.

44:44.222 --> 44:46.850
He'll find you.

44:50.996 --> 44:52.486
- Don't move!

45:28.900 --> 45:29.958
- Hey!

45:35.307 --> 45:36.399
- Move!

49:35.613 --> 49:36.944
- Oh...

49:38.083 --> 49:41.075
To find beauty
in a place like this,

49:41.119 --> 49:44.611
where...
where so much is dirty.

49:47.225 --> 49:49.489
<i>You see nothing.</i>

49:53.064 --> 49:55.897
- To bathe is more intimate
than love.

49:57.402 --> 50:00.064
<i>- You touch nothing.</i>

50:09.748 --> 50:13.377
- There.
Perfection.

50:13.418 --> 50:15.886
<i>- You are nothing.</i>

50:35.774 --> 50:37.264
- Vitria?

50:38.276 --> 50:39.903
Ade?

50:39.944 --> 50:42.344
Budi?

50:42.380 --> 50:44.905
Vitria?

50:44.949 --> 50:45.973
Budi!

51:02.500 --> 51:03.592
Hello?

51:07.372 --> 51:08.999
- Ah, Lieutenant Hashim.

51:09.040 --> 51:10.940
<i>Peace be with you.</i>

51:10.975 --> 51:12.169
- Who is this?

51:12.210 --> 51:15.873
- They tell me
you are a very reliable man,

51:15.914 --> 51:19.213
the best in detachment 88.

51:19.250 --> 51:20.683
- Where is my family?

51:20.718 --> 51:22.413
- Can I rely on you,
Lieutenant?

51:22.454 --> 51:24.046
- Yes.

51:24.089 --> 51:26.080
- Yeah.

51:26.124 --> 51:27.648
I have important business.

51:27.692 --> 51:30.320
And when I finish,
I will release your family.

51:30.361 --> 51:32.226
Until then,
you will take some time off

51:32.263 --> 51:34.561
to grieve for your friend.

51:34.599 --> 51:36.897
Are we clear, Lieutenant?

51:36.935 --> 51:38.835
<i>I understand.</i>

51:38.870 --> 51:41.134
- Are we clear, Lieutenant?

51:43.374 --> 51:44.534
- Yes.

51:45.543 --> 51:46.703
Absolutely.

52:14.305 --> 52:15.397
- Hashim.

52:15.440 --> 52:17.067
Listen, you got to...

52:18.176 --> 52:19.871
- They took my family.

52:19.911 --> 52:21.674
If you're FBI,

52:21.713 --> 52:23.340
why are you in handcuffs?

52:23.381 --> 52:25.474
Why are there U.S. Marines
outside this door?

52:25.517 --> 52:26.848
Huh?

52:28.253 --> 52:31.814
- I'm no superspy, Hash.

52:39.797 --> 52:42.231
I was a Marine MP,

52:42.267 --> 52:44.258
a cop, like you.

52:46.037 --> 52:49.666
In Baghdad, I ran embassy detail
on a museum opening...

52:49.707 --> 52:51.368
jewels, art.

52:52.810 --> 52:54.778
- Go on.

52:54.812 --> 52:57.212
- There was a bombing...

52:57.248 --> 52:59.716
36 civilians killed

52:59.751 --> 53:02.413
and 1 marine.

53:02.453 --> 53:04.921
CIA blamed Al-Qaeda,

53:04.956 --> 53:05.980
but with Bin Laden dead,

53:06.024 --> 53:07.355
it just didn't feel right.

53:08.960 --> 53:11.895
So I started watching
the intel.

53:11.930 --> 53:15.297
More bombings, same pattern.

53:15.333 --> 53:16.561
VIP events.

53:16.601 --> 53:18.660
Jewels, art.

53:20.138 --> 53:21.196
- And?

53:21.239 --> 53:25.198
- They're not terrorists, Hash.

53:25.243 --> 53:27.211
The sultana had
a $7-million necklace on

53:27.245 --> 53:28.872
when she was killed.

53:28.913 --> 53:31.381
- Yes, it's in
an evidence locker.

53:31.416 --> 53:33.941
- Have you checked if it's real?

53:33.985 --> 53:36.078
They switched girls, Hash,

53:36.120 --> 53:38.918
and necklaces,
before the bombing.

53:40.458 --> 53:42.358
You got to get me out of here.

53:44.329 --> 53:45.921
We're cops, man.

53:45.964 --> 53:48.194
We got to stick together.

53:48.233 --> 53:50.497
You gonna trust your boss
to find Vitria?

53:50.535 --> 53:52.127
The kids?

53:54.105 --> 53:56.266
- You're an officer
in the Marines?

53:56.307 --> 53:58.741
- A lieutenant, like you.

54:07.318 --> 54:09.252
- Richard Travers...

54:09.287 --> 54:10.276
- Look.

54:10.321 --> 54:12.915
- Private first class, USMC.

54:12.957 --> 54:15.084
- You don't understand.
- Yes, I do.

54:15.126 --> 54:18.118
You're a liar.
Mr. Not-Wilde.

54:18.162 --> 54:19.493
- Hash...
- Lieutenant Not-Jake.

54:19.530 --> 54:21.498
- Hash...

54:21.532 --> 54:24.194
- You belong in prison,

54:24.235 --> 54:26.897
where they give you a number,
not a name.

54:30.241 --> 54:31.902
- I got a name for ya.

54:35.780 --> 54:37.975
The guy that has your family?

54:38.016 --> 54:39.574
I know his name.

54:39.617 --> 54:40.948
- Tell me.

54:40.985 --> 54:43.317
- You need to get
your family back?

54:43.354 --> 54:45.345
Get me out of here.

54:45.390 --> 54:47.722
And we both get what we want.

54:50.995 --> 54:53.759
- You must be Lieutenant Hashim.

54:53.798 --> 54:57.097
Thanks for helping us
recover our fugitive.

54:57.135 --> 54:58.261
- Fugitive?

54:59.837 --> 55:01.395
Got a warrant on him.

55:05.677 --> 55:07.304
<i>- Excuse me, sir.</i>

55:07.345 --> 55:09.438
I need to speak with you

55:09.480 --> 55:11.345
about politics.

55:12.517 --> 55:14.109
- Look this way.

55:14.152 --> 55:15.176
No.

55:24.862 --> 55:27.990
Superb, for my buyer.

55:28.032 --> 55:31.934
The Chinese are great lovers
of royal things.

55:31.969 --> 55:33.732
Who knows?

55:35.239 --> 55:37.571
Maybe they will buy you.

55:43.881 --> 55:44.870
- Sultana!

55:51.389 --> 55:55.223
<i>- Did they hurt you?
Your children?</i>

56:13.378 --> 56:16.905
- Youth has a beauty of its own,
huh?

56:16.948 --> 56:20.941
Perhaps because it slips away
so quickly.

56:22.987 --> 56:26.889
- The policeman's wife,
the children...

56:26.924 --> 56:30.382
This is not part of our deal.

56:30.428 --> 56:33.295
- You will be rewarded.

56:33.331 --> 56:35.799
<i>No, my pretty little girl.</i>

56:35.833 --> 56:37.630
Not good for you.

56:44.242 --> 56:46.710
They love the chocolate.

56:46.744 --> 56:49.042
- We care nothing for money.

56:49.080 --> 56:52.208
- Yet you seem to need
so much of it for your jihad.

56:52.250 --> 56:53.717
- Jihad is not a license

56:53.751 --> 56:55.446
for the desecration
of innocents!

56:55.486 --> 56:57.545
- No, no.

56:57.588 --> 56:59.419
<i>Just their murder.</i>

57:04.095 --> 57:05.585
- You are warned, Malik.

57:05.630 --> 57:09.760
You cannot have the good wife
or the children.

57:14.939 --> 57:17.430
- I can have anything I want.

57:19.277 --> 57:21.905
Why do you think I am here?

57:35.993 --> 57:38.120
- Cap, you got to let me go.

57:38.162 --> 57:39.390
You know why.

57:39.430 --> 57:41.694
- That's why
I'm taking you home, Jake.

57:52.310 --> 57:53.334
For Christ's sake.

58:18.135 --> 58:20.228
Get off!
Fuck you!

58:20.271 --> 58:21.431
Get off me!

58:21.472 --> 58:22.530
Get off!

58:25.042 --> 58:26.771
Get off me!
Get off!

58:56.641 --> 58:59.041
<i>This is the choice you've made.</i>

59:01.412 --> 59:03.073
He's all yours.

59:16.627 --> 59:17.651
- A name.

59:18.763 --> 59:20.253
- Hash?

59:20.298 --> 59:22.926
- You promised me a name.

59:22.967 --> 59:26.061
Lie to me again, and I swear,

59:26.103 --> 59:29.971
I will send you back to America
in a body bag.

59:31.509 --> 59:33.636
- Malik.

59:33.678 --> 59:37.808
He's American or European...

59:39.116 --> 59:41.107
- Not even a Muslim.

59:47.825 --> 59:52.956
When he says
<i>"as-salaam alaikum,"</i>

59:52.997 --> 59:54.658
it lacks respect.

59:58.970 --> 01:00:02.428
- So why all of this
street theater?

01:00:02.473 --> 01:00:04.703
- The general and I
made a deal.

01:00:04.742 --> 01:00:05.936
The Americans cannot know.

01:00:10.548 --> 01:00:13.676
Now, the truth.
All of it.

01:00:13.718 --> 01:00:16.050
- Malik's an opportunist.

01:00:16.087 --> 01:00:17.987
The bombings are a distraction.

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:23.119
- Quite a distraction.

01:00:31.135 --> 01:00:32.432
Very expensive.

01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:33.937
- Fuck, Hash,

01:00:33.971 --> 01:00:35.598
we're talking big bucks.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.107
It's the perfect crime.

01:00:37.141 --> 01:00:39.803
People just blame
the fuckin' Abduls...

01:00:41.545 --> 01:00:43.513
Terrorists.

01:00:43.547 --> 01:00:45.913
- How does he get people
to blow themselves up for him?

01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:48.851
- He uses remote detonation,
right?

01:00:48.886 --> 01:00:50.854
This guy leaves nothing
to chance.

01:00:50.888 --> 01:00:53.328
- And you think Malik switched
the sultana with another woman?

01:00:53.357 --> 01:00:54.619
- I know he did.

01:00:54.659 --> 01:00:56.991
- Why?
And how?

01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:02.322
- The how, I know.

01:01:02.366 --> 01:01:03.993
The why,

01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:06.265
I haven't figured out yet.

01:01:07.338 --> 01:01:09.067
But I will.

01:01:09.106 --> 01:01:11.574
- We will.

01:01:11.609 --> 01:01:14.339
- Yeah, right.

01:01:14.378 --> 01:01:15.845
So where are we headed?

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.872
- It's time to speak
to the sultan.

01:01:36.333 --> 01:01:38.494
Thank you for seeing us,
Your Majesty.

01:01:40.371 --> 01:01:42.999
- You say it involves
my daughter?

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.338
- We need to discuss
her necklace.

01:01:48.746 --> 01:01:51.340
- Her necklace?

01:01:51.382 --> 01:01:53.373
I don't understand.

01:01:53.417 --> 01:01:54.441
You are...

01:01:54.485 --> 01:01:56.646
- Travers.

01:01:56.687 --> 01:01:58.120
Kidnapping squad.

01:02:00.958 --> 01:02:03.358
Kidnapping...

01:02:03.394 --> 01:02:05.521
- So sorry, Your Highness.

01:02:05.563 --> 01:02:07.622
There are some details
about the bombing that...

01:02:07.665 --> 01:02:09.656
- The general told us...

01:02:11.202 --> 01:02:13.932
The matter has been resolved.

01:02:13.971 --> 01:02:16.303
The killers were given justice,
yeah?

01:02:18.242 --> 01:02:20.540
- Still, there are details...

01:02:20.578 --> 01:02:23.069
- You were right next to her
when the bomb went off.

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:24.809
- Jake.

01:02:24.849 --> 01:02:25.838
- How dare you?

01:02:25.883 --> 01:02:26.941
- I thank you...

01:02:29.286 --> 01:02:31.754
Both of you...

01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:33.484
for your concern.

01:02:37.061 --> 01:02:38.756
<i>- Thank you, Sultan.</i>

01:02:50.741 --> 01:02:52.231
- They were hiding something.

01:02:54.578 --> 01:02:56.478
Hash, he was up to his ass
in lies.

01:02:56.514 --> 01:02:58.607
- Many people lie when it serves
their interests.

01:02:58.649 --> 01:03:00.446
- But we had 'em by the balls.

01:03:00.484 --> 01:03:01.974
That's when you squeeze,
partner!

01:03:05.623 --> 01:03:06.920
<i>- Enough!</i>

01:03:06.957 --> 01:03:08.857
Haven't you gotten
enough people killed?

01:03:08.893 --> 01:03:10.121
Huh?

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:12.595
Americans,
always you are telling;

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:13.927
never listening.

01:03:13.964 --> 01:03:16.330
Always fighting;
never hearing.

01:03:16.367 --> 01:03:18.494
- Yeah, that's us.

01:03:18.536 --> 01:03:20.401
Violent country.

01:03:20.437 --> 01:03:22.928
- This is no time for jokes.

01:03:22.973 --> 01:03:24.440
My family is at stake.

01:03:25.543 --> 01:03:28.740
- From now on,
we play by my rules.

01:03:28.779 --> 01:03:30.440
Java rules.

01:03:46.764 --> 01:03:50.393
- Some kind of sneaky
Javanese karate?

01:03:50.434 --> 01:03:54.370
- Not karate.
Pencak silat.

01:03:54.405 --> 01:03:55.565
It's an ancient martial art

01:03:55.606 --> 01:03:57.597
that prizes cunning
over strength.

01:03:57.641 --> 01:03:58.699
- No shit.

01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:01.136
- And this is how we must act.

01:04:01.178 --> 01:04:02.202
- Ah...

01:04:03.747 --> 01:04:06.238
- Not like a bull
in a Chinese shop.

01:04:06.283 --> 01:04:08.148
- China shop.

01:04:08.185 --> 01:04:10.346
Like dishes?

01:04:10.387 --> 01:04:12.378
- Why would a bull buy dishes?

01:04:14.725 --> 01:04:16.352
- They told us jack shit
in there.

01:04:16.393 --> 01:04:17.860
- They told us everything.

01:04:17.895 --> 01:04:20.887
You were too busy talking
about the vizier.

01:04:20.931 --> 01:04:21.920
"Blah, blah, blah."

01:04:21.966 --> 01:04:23.092
- I was trying to figure out
what they know.

01:04:23.133 --> 01:04:24.760
- And did you?

01:04:24.802 --> 01:04:26.167
Think, Jake.

01:04:26.203 --> 01:04:27.227
Even the sultana's body

01:04:27.271 --> 01:04:30.399
must be viewed by next of kin.

01:04:30.441 --> 01:04:32.466
- So the sultan already knew...

01:04:32.509 --> 01:04:34.272
- That his daughter is alive?

01:04:34.311 --> 01:04:35.869
Yes.

01:04:35.913 --> 01:04:41.943
So tell me,
Mr. FBI Kidnapping Expert,

01:04:41.986 --> 01:04:44.955
why does the father
of a kidnap victim

01:04:44.989 --> 01:04:47.048
refuse to speak to the police?

01:04:48.592 --> 01:04:51.891
- 'Cause the kidnappers tell him
not to talk to the cops

01:04:51.929 --> 01:04:53.897
while they wait for a ransom.

01:04:53.931 --> 01:04:56.229
- Ah.
You see.

01:04:57.234 --> 01:05:00.032
Speak less, learn more.

01:05:00.070 --> 01:05:01.833
Like the curious fact
that the sultan

01:05:01.872 --> 01:05:05.137
doesn't want to talk
in front of the vizier.

01:05:05.175 --> 01:05:09.077
- How do you know the sultan
wants to talk to us all?

01:05:09.113 --> 01:05:12.549
- Because when I kissed
his hand, he gave me this.

01:05:14.752 --> 01:05:16.083
- Midnight?

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.519
- At the aqueducts.

01:05:17.554 --> 01:05:18.782
Before that, we need proof.

01:05:38.542 --> 01:05:39.668
- Ah...

01:05:40.744 --> 01:05:43.144
Bingo.

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.444
All that glitters isn't gold.

01:05:45.482 --> 01:05:46.949
- "Glisters."

01:05:46.984 --> 01:05:48.178
- Glisters?

01:05:48.218 --> 01:05:49.810
- Shakespeare.

01:05:49.853 --> 01:05:51.320
<i>Merchant of Venice.</i>

01:05:51.355 --> 01:05:52.754
- Hey...

01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:53.916
- Time to go.

01:06:09.873 --> 01:06:11.272
- Were you followed?

01:06:13.544 --> 01:06:15.842
- How does one know?

01:06:15.879 --> 01:06:17.847
- You listen

01:06:17.881 --> 01:06:19.348
and trust your instincts.

01:06:19.383 --> 01:06:23.046
- Why do my instincts tell me
to trust you?

01:06:24.488 --> 01:06:28.788
- Because the man who has
your daughter has my family.

01:06:28.826 --> 01:06:31.124
- Sir, we brought the necklace.

01:06:31.161 --> 01:06:32.594
Can you tell if it's a fake?

01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:37.599
- I know it's a fake.

01:06:37.634 --> 01:06:39.261
- Then why not say so?

01:06:39.303 --> 01:06:43.433
- My cousin, the vizier,

01:06:43.474 --> 01:06:45.942
he wants the throne.

01:06:45.976 --> 01:06:48.137
He has made a pact
with this man.

01:06:48.178 --> 01:06:50.669
- This is about more
than just a necklace.

01:06:50.714 --> 01:06:53.842
- The choker is part
of a collection...

01:06:53.884 --> 01:06:56.148
the crown jewels of Java.

01:06:56.186 --> 01:06:58.677
- How's the exchange
gonna take place?

01:06:59.757 --> 01:07:02.055
- There will not be one,
Mr. Travers.

01:07:04.695 --> 01:07:05.855
- Go! Go!

01:07:07.598 --> 01:07:08.895
Go!

01:07:37.528 --> 01:07:39.325
- We got to move out.

01:07:49.206 --> 01:07:50.264
- Go...

01:07:50.307 --> 01:07:52.673
<i>- Wife, call an ambulance.</i>

01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:58.948
- Hash...

01:07:58.982 --> 01:08:00.540
- I cannot leave him.

01:08:00.584 --> 01:08:02.142
- Okay.

01:08:02.186 --> 01:08:03.483
The keys.

01:08:15.599 --> 01:08:16.930
- Can you trust...

01:08:18.102 --> 01:08:19.433
This <i>bule?</i>

01:08:24.341 --> 01:08:25.671
- No.

01:08:31.448 --> 01:08:33.245
What did you mean,

01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:34.944
there won't be an exchange?

01:08:34.984 --> 01:08:38.386
- I ordered the central bank

01:08:38.421 --> 01:08:43.519
to send our treasures
to the palace

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.720
before dawn.

01:08:48.298 --> 01:08:50.960
Once my cousin gets them...

01:08:55.238 --> 01:08:57.069
Everything is lost.

01:09:04.148 --> 01:09:05.809
- Hash, come on.

01:09:11.822 --> 01:09:13.288
<i>The palace confirms</i>

01:09:13.323 --> 01:09:15.154
<i>the victim
is Sri Sultan the Tenth,</i>

01:09:15.192 --> 01:09:17.319
<i>found two hours ago.</i>

01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:19.295
<i>The sultan's heir,
the grand vizier,</i>

01:09:19.328 --> 01:09:20.660
<i>witnessed the crime,</i>

01:09:20.697 --> 01:09:23.393
<i>which he said was instigated
by foreign agents</i>

01:09:23.433 --> 01:09:26.060
<i>as a strike against
Javanese Muslims.</i>

01:09:26.103 --> 01:09:30.233
<i>Suspects include U.S. Marine
Lieutenant Jacob Travers.</i>

01:09:30.274 --> 01:09:32.707
<i>Also wanted
in the sultan's murder:</i>

01:09:32.743 --> 01:09:36.645
<i>Lieutenant Hashim
of detachment 88.</i>

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:39.877
<i>Both men are armed
and considered dangerous.</i>

01:09:41.251 --> 01:09:43.412
<i>It's okay to cry, Sultana.</i>

01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:48.151
<i>- Not in front of him.</i>

01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:01.398
- There.

01:10:07.978 --> 01:10:10.276
Ooh, we're gonna get
these guys.

01:10:10.314 --> 01:10:13.078
- Who are you, really?

01:10:14.084 --> 01:10:15.415
Jake?

01:10:15.452 --> 01:10:17.215
Richard?

01:10:17.254 --> 01:10:19.620
- We aren't doing this
right now.

01:10:26.797 --> 01:10:28.424
- There's always time for truth.

01:10:32.836 --> 01:10:34.269
No more lies, Jake.

01:10:45.616 --> 01:10:46.674
- Fuck, man.

01:10:47.918 --> 01:10:50.216
He followed me everywhere,
you know?

01:10:50.254 --> 01:10:53.382
I played tight end;
he plays tight end.

01:10:53.423 --> 01:10:56.950
I dropped out of school;
he drops out.

01:10:59.563 --> 01:11:01.463
I join the Marines,

01:11:01.498 --> 01:11:03.523
and he comes all the way
to Baghdad

01:11:03.567 --> 01:11:05.626
to be like his big brother.

01:11:07.204 --> 01:11:11.197
- The marine who was lost
in the bombing.

01:11:15.579 --> 01:11:16.841
- Yeah.

01:11:21.418 --> 01:11:23.750
Then they don't even put me
on the case.

01:11:23.787 --> 01:11:25.482
They offer counseling.

01:11:25.522 --> 01:11:27.080
"Hey, we'll send you back
stateside

01:11:27.124 --> 01:11:29.422
until you get your head
on straight."

01:11:29.459 --> 01:11:31.825
You know, you can't just go home
and say, "Hey, Mom!"

01:11:31.862 --> 01:11:33.227
"I know you didn't want me
to join up

01:11:33.263 --> 01:11:36.323
cause you were afraid
Richard might come."

01:11:36.366 --> 01:11:38.800
"Now Richie's never coming home."

01:11:41.238 --> 01:11:44.674
"You know, everything's good
'cause I'm in counseling, so..."

01:11:47.077 --> 01:11:48.635
Fuck that...
you go after the bastards

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:50.237
who killed
your motherfucking brother,

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.339
and you say to him,
"Counsel that, motherfucker!"

01:11:52.382 --> 01:11:54.714
That's what you do.

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.451
- Thank you.

01:12:01.792 --> 01:12:03.589
I needed to know.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.201
- Let's do this shit already.

01:12:22.646 --> 01:12:23.943
- These men are innocent,

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.470
like your brother.

01:12:27.551 --> 01:12:30.349
We take what we need and go.

01:12:30.387 --> 01:12:31.877
- I got it.

01:12:33.223 --> 01:12:35.657
- Put on your seat belt.

01:12:35.692 --> 01:12:37.353
- You fucking serious?

01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:38.452
- It's the law.

01:12:38.495 --> 01:12:40.122
500,000 rupiah fine.

01:12:40.163 --> 01:12:41.960
- You got to be kidding me.

01:12:41.998 --> 01:12:43.158
- I am.

01:12:45.402 --> 01:12:46.460
To relieve the tension.

01:12:50.707 --> 01:12:51.799
Hold on.

01:13:01.118 --> 01:13:02.415
<i>Don't move!</i>

01:13:02.452 --> 01:13:03.942
<i>Drop your guns!</i>

01:13:05.555 --> 01:13:07.386
<i>Drop your guns!</i>

01:13:07.424 --> 01:13:10.120
- All right, boys,
faces down, hands up!

01:13:11.728 --> 01:13:14.663
I said hands up!

01:13:14.698 --> 01:13:16.029
Um, Hash?

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:20.064
<i>- Police!
Detachment 88.</i>

01:13:20.103 --> 01:13:23.561
- Think they're like, uh,
a different division.

01:13:23.607 --> 01:13:25.404
- They think we're stealing
the crown jewels!

01:13:25.442 --> 01:13:26.807
- We are!

01:13:26.843 --> 01:13:28.083
We're just not very good at it!

01:14:13.523 --> 01:14:16.048
- Open the door!

01:14:16.092 --> 01:14:18.617
Ow!

01:14:18.662 --> 01:14:19.720
Ow!

01:14:21.565 --> 01:14:22.623
Get up!

01:14:27.771 --> 01:14:30.763
Now open the goddamn door!

01:14:30.807 --> 01:14:32.274
- Jake!

01:14:32.309 --> 01:14:33.401
Jake, don't!

01:14:34.611 --> 01:14:35.737
- I said,

01:14:35.779 --> 01:14:39.772
open the fucking door!

01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:48.057
Get the hell out!

01:14:48.091 --> 01:14:49.524
Get down!

01:14:56.299 --> 01:14:57.288
Hash!

01:14:57.334 --> 01:14:58.358
- Yeah!

01:15:01.037 --> 01:15:02.436
Come on!

01:15:15.051 --> 01:15:16.848
You were going to kill
that man!

01:15:17.921 --> 01:15:20.219
- Nah.
Had the safety on.

01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:54.982
- Please, sir.

01:16:00.196 --> 01:16:01.595
Are you serious?

01:16:01.631 --> 01:16:03.622
- Don't even start.

01:16:04.768 --> 01:16:06.235
- Can you give us a minute?

01:16:07.704 --> 01:16:10.298
<i>- This is a great hideout.</i>

01:16:11.675 --> 01:16:14.508
Besides, you had the easy part.

01:16:16.012 --> 01:16:18.139
I had to lug that shit up here.

01:16:26.957 --> 01:16:28.185
- New clothes.

01:16:28.224 --> 01:16:29.282
A disguise.

01:16:32.929 --> 01:16:35.056
- Thanks.

01:16:35.098 --> 01:16:36.759
- Oh, yes.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:38.267
Better to dress like
the ex-marine

01:16:38.301 --> 01:16:39.598
who's wanted for murder.

01:16:39.636 --> 01:16:43.299
- Buddy, there ain't no thing
as an ex-marine.

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:44.602
Semper Fi.

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.655
<i>Peace be with you, pilgrim.</i>

01:17:05.695 --> 01:17:07.424
- Hey, Lieutenant Hashim,

01:17:07.464 --> 01:17:09.125
let us not pretend.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.265
You know what I am.

01:17:12.302 --> 01:17:13.894
- Listen up, asshole!

01:17:13.937 --> 01:17:15.495
Let his family go, and maybe
we can make a deal with...

01:17:15.538 --> 01:17:18.006
- How does it feel,
Lieutenant Travers, to know

01:17:18.041 --> 01:17:19.770
that you have failed
your brother...

01:17:19.809 --> 01:17:20.867
again?

01:17:22.479 --> 01:17:23.537
<i>Bientôt, mon ami.</i>

01:17:54.244 --> 01:17:56.212
Ah...

01:17:56.246 --> 01:17:58.077
American technology,

01:17:58.114 --> 01:18:01.572
very good
for tracking terrorists.

01:18:12.529 --> 01:18:13.621
- You okay?

01:18:32.649 --> 01:18:33.707
Leave it!

01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:35.581
- I can't!
My family!

01:18:35.618 --> 01:18:36.676
- You're no good to 'em dead!

01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:37.778
- No!

01:18:54.003 --> 01:18:55.061
- Get down!

01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.298
Come on.

01:19:03.146 --> 01:19:05.171
Shut up!
Shut up!

01:19:05.215 --> 01:19:07.410
- Righty-o, righty-o.
Take it easy, mate.

01:19:22.132 --> 01:19:23.453
<i>Where did they go?</i>

01:19:23.466 --> 01:19:24.626
<i>Quickly, tell me!</i>

01:19:43.753 --> 01:19:46.085
Get off.
Slowly.

01:20:23.126 --> 01:20:24.957
- Anything can grow here.

01:20:24.994 --> 01:20:26.985
<i>- You'll be home soon.</i>

01:20:36.406 --> 01:20:37.703
- Do you want to get us all
killed?

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:39.071
She's supposed to be dead!

01:20:39.108 --> 01:20:40.769
<i>- A little insurance.</i>

01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:42.607
<i>They will all be dead.</i>

01:20:42.645 --> 01:20:45.637
<i>As soon as your men
get my merchandise to market.</i>

01:20:46.649 --> 01:20:47.980
- I've warned you!

01:20:49.385 --> 01:20:50.443
Move!

01:20:57.460 --> 01:20:59.087
Come with me.
Trust me.

01:20:59.128 --> 01:21:00.720
<i>Come quickly.</i>

01:21:12.675 --> 01:21:14.336
<i>Peace be with you, pilgrim.</i>

01:21:26.089 --> 01:21:27.113
- Don't!

01:21:28.258 --> 01:21:29.247
My family!

01:21:30.326 --> 01:21:31.350
Go!

01:21:59.022 --> 01:22:00.148
Jake.

01:22:02.692 --> 01:22:03.750
Look.

01:22:36.292 --> 01:22:38.226
- Keys.

01:23:13.196 --> 01:23:14.891
You work

01:23:14.931 --> 01:23:16.922
with an American soldier.

01:23:20.937 --> 01:23:23.906
They bomb our children.

01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:25.567
- Yeah.

01:23:25.608 --> 01:23:27.940
He, too, has lost family
in this war.

01:23:29.512 --> 01:23:32.174
And now he helps me
to find mine.

01:23:33.182 --> 01:23:35.844
- Your family is still alive.

01:23:39.622 --> 01:23:41.112
Until tonight.

01:23:43.259 --> 01:23:45.921
<i>God willing.</i>

01:23:45.962 --> 01:23:47.088
<i>- God willing.</i>

01:23:47.130 --> 01:23:48.961
<i>- They will be at the festival.</i>

01:23:50.033 --> 01:23:53.025
Don't let Malik take your boy.

01:24:00.610 --> 01:24:03.078
No...

01:24:03.112 --> 01:24:05.410
- You must declare your faith.

01:24:23.433 --> 01:24:24.957
<i>- I bear witness</i>

01:24:25.001 --> 01:24:27.936
<i>that there is no other god
but Allah</i>

01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:31.599
<i>and that Mohammad
is his prophet.</i>

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:12.341
<i>Get back to work!</i>

01:25:45.381 --> 01:25:48.248
I hope you have an explanation
for this.

01:26:13.276 --> 01:26:14.937
Where are they?

01:26:14.977 --> 01:26:16.604
Where are the jewels?

01:26:16.646 --> 01:26:17.874
- You're pathetic!

01:26:19.048 --> 01:26:21.573
We sold them years ago
to feed our people.

01:26:26.689 --> 01:26:28.316
Yes.

01:26:28.357 --> 01:26:30.951
The only thing
my father wouldn't sell.

01:26:33.129 --> 01:26:35.256
That necklace
will feed Java for a year

01:26:35.298 --> 01:26:37.357
when I take the throne!

01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:50.374
- Your shotgun is showing.

01:26:50.413 --> 01:26:51.437
- Shit.

01:27:14.003 --> 01:27:15.265
- Hey!

01:27:16.939 --> 01:27:18.964
<i>Get out now.
I'll settle this.</i>

01:27:23.246 --> 01:27:24.440
<i>Get out.</i>

01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.538
<i>Get out!</i>

01:27:25.581 --> 01:27:27.071
- Check it out.

01:27:30.119 --> 01:27:31.950
- No witnesses.

01:27:39.962 --> 01:27:41.020
- Hey...

01:27:43.733 --> 01:27:45.166
- Hey, Jake.

01:27:56.045 --> 01:27:57.637
- No.

01:28:23.406 --> 01:28:24.430
<i>- Mon vizier,</i>

01:28:24.473 --> 01:28:27.237
you know, the Chinese,
they pay...

01:28:27.276 --> 01:28:29.710
€2 million for a tiger,

01:28:29.745 --> 01:28:31.178
1 million for a rhino.

01:28:32.682 --> 01:28:35.014
What do you think they will pay
for a princess?

01:28:50.333 --> 01:28:52.062
- Oh, give me a reason.

01:28:54.704 --> 01:28:55.864
- How about two?

01:28:58.708 --> 01:29:00.141
Your choice.

01:29:00.176 --> 01:29:02.872
<i>- Thoersi!
Sastha!</i>

01:29:02.912 --> 01:29:04.402
<i>You know who I am!</i>

01:29:07.883 --> 01:29:09.180
<i>- He...</i>

01:29:09.218 --> 01:29:10.242
<i>He killed the vizier.</i>

01:29:10.286 --> 01:29:11.753
- Stay back.

01:29:11.787 --> 01:29:13.721
Stay back.

01:29:13.756 --> 01:29:15.348
<i>- Drop the knife!</i>

01:29:15.391 --> 01:29:16.358
<i>- Protect her!</i>

01:29:16.392 --> 01:29:17.689
<i>- Let her go!</i>

01:29:17.727 --> 01:29:19.058
- No! No!

01:29:33.909 --> 01:29:35.376
Hash, you okay?

01:29:35.411 --> 01:29:37.174
- Yeah...

01:29:46.756 --> 01:29:48.280
<i>Move, pig!</i>

01:29:49.291 --> 01:29:52.385
- Move! Move!
Get down!

01:29:52.428 --> 01:29:54.589
Move!

01:29:54.630 --> 01:29:55.654
Move, move, move!

01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.828
<i>My place is here.</i>

01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:04.362
<i>- My husband
is a police officer.</i>

01:30:09.311 --> 01:30:10.938
- Get out of the way!

01:30:12.348 --> 01:30:13.440
- Jake!

01:30:13.482 --> 01:30:15.245
<i>Polisi!
Minggir, Polisi!</i>

01:30:19.588 --> 01:30:21.283
- Move!

01:30:21.323 --> 01:30:22.381
Get down!

01:30:22.425 --> 01:30:23.585
- Jake!

01:30:28.297 --> 01:30:30.492
Crowd:
Sultana! Sultana!

01:30:30.533 --> 01:30:32.000
Sultana! Sultana!

01:30:57.293 --> 01:30:58.954
<i>- Allez, allez, cochonne!</i>

01:31:00.863 --> 01:31:03.354
- Get down!
Get down!

01:33:02.384 --> 01:33:04.352
- Well...

01:33:04.386 --> 01:33:06.354
The shotgun

01:33:06.388 --> 01:33:09.016
is a poor choice, my friend.

01:33:09.058 --> 01:33:10.150
Like you.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.185
It lacks precision.

01:33:46.895 --> 01:33:47.953
- Hey.

01:33:49.031 --> 01:33:51.329
I have a necklace in my pocket

01:33:51.367 --> 01:33:54.165
that will buy my way out of...

01:33:54.203 --> 01:33:56.262
Oh, this crazy place.

01:33:57.706 --> 01:33:59.003
I have everything.

01:34:01.410 --> 01:34:02.570
And now...

01:34:05.547 --> 01:34:07.139
I have you.

01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:12.482
What's wrong?

01:34:12.521 --> 01:34:16.252
Did you run out of, uh,
American tough-guy insults?

01:34:16.291 --> 01:34:17.349
Huh?

01:34:20.195 --> 01:34:23.323
Hey, you want to call me
"asshole"?

01:34:23.365 --> 01:34:25.026
Or, "Hey, motherfucker"?

01:34:26.402 --> 01:34:29.894
- See, this friend of mine
told me to talk less...

01:34:31.407 --> 01:34:32.431
And listen more.

01:34:32.474 --> 01:34:34.374
- Well, cowboy,

01:34:34.410 --> 01:34:35.741
listen to this.

01:34:43.218 --> 01:34:44.276
- Jake.

01:35:07.509 --> 01:35:11.172
That's how you use a shotgun,
motherfucker!

01:35:33.335 --> 01:35:35.462
- Jake.
Jake.

01:36:17.079 --> 01:36:18.444
- Sorry...

01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:21.005
I know you can't kiss
on the mouth in public.

01:36:21.049 --> 01:36:23.347
It's against the law.

01:36:23.385 --> 01:36:25.876
- It is not.

01:36:25.921 --> 01:36:27.752
Who told you that?

01:36:36.799 --> 01:36:39.290
- Oh, I almost forgot.

01:36:40.636 --> 01:36:42.797
A little going-away present.

01:36:47.476 --> 01:36:49.774
- You don't know
what this means.

01:36:49.812 --> 01:36:52.474
- Yes, I do.

01:37:10.432 --> 01:37:11.592
- Hey, Jake.

01:37:15.838 --> 01:37:17.135
How did you...

01:37:17.172 --> 01:37:18.469
- I figured your boss
had a price

01:37:18.507 --> 01:37:20.907
for springing me
from these jarheads.

01:37:20.943 --> 01:37:23.741
We got politics
in the corps too.

01:37:23.779 --> 01:37:25.906
And generals.

01:37:25.948 --> 01:37:27.779
That fake we stole
from the morgue?

01:37:30.385 --> 01:37:31.875
Then after we got Malik...

01:37:36.558 --> 01:37:38.025
Well, you get the picture.

01:37:40.095 --> 01:37:42.086
- I gave the general a fake?

01:37:43.098 --> 01:37:44.360
- What's he gonna do?

01:37:44.399 --> 01:37:45.593
Call the cops?

01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:49.731
Best weapon, right?

01:37:51.473 --> 01:37:54.101
- Your brother
would have been proud, Jake.

01:37:54.142 --> 01:37:55.302
I'm proud.

01:37:56.912 --> 01:38:00.109
- Well, hopefully the
court-martial sees it that way.

01:38:00.148 --> 01:38:02.844
- Good-bye, Mas Jake.

01:38:04.786 --> 01:38:06.276
- See ya, Hash.
