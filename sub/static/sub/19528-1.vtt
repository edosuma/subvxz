04:19.259 --> 04:21.726
- You sure this ain't my baby?

04:21.728 --> 04:24.162
He thinks I'm dad,
i see now, look.

04:24.164 --> 04:26.932
This fucker's mine,
he has my eyes.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.401
- His name is Mickey
and you know that.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.670
You didn't want yours, can't
be fucking your plan up.

04:31.672 --> 04:34.840
That's a quote, and
them eyes ain't yours.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.341
- People lie.

04:36.343 --> 04:39.177
You know that, right, like,
how do I know you didn't,

04:39.179 --> 04:40.679
tell me you gave
him away and lied,

04:40.681 --> 04:42.981
like and then you kept him.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.916
- 'Cause, I don't know.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.986
He'd be like two
or three years old.

04:53.926 --> 04:56.228
Wanna put my baby in the
room and come fuck me?

04:56.230 --> 04:58.730
- I ain't touching that baby.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.232
Do I look like a dad to you?

05:00.234 --> 05:03.068
- You don't even
look like a man.

05:05.204 --> 05:07.873
Take my baby to the other room.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.108
And come fuck me.

05:12.913 --> 05:13.979
- Hell dude.

05:15.381 --> 05:17.015
He can't even talk.

05:18.885 --> 05:22.821
He can't eat, he can't feed
himself, he can't wash himself.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.391
That baby can't even
give himself his shower.

05:26.393 --> 05:27.759
Right?

05:27.761 --> 05:29.528
He don't know nothing.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.529
So come on.

05:33.199 --> 05:35.267
I ain't touching that
other dude's baby.

05:35.269 --> 05:37.336
- You fucked it up.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.170
- What, no.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.071
No, no.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.142
- These rich fuckas.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.814
They always, always go on
vacation during their move.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.349
They don't wanna lift a finger,

05:50.351 --> 05:53.285
they don't want to move as
much as a spoon by 'emselves,

05:53.287 --> 05:57.022
so, presentation is
key, simple and classic.

05:59.692 --> 06:03.095
Rent your car in a one-off site.

06:03.097 --> 06:03.995
Stilettos.

06:06.032 --> 06:09.301
Couple of buttons
undone on the shirt.

06:09.303 --> 06:13.305
It's very important she
has to turn the hubby on,

06:13.307 --> 06:16.541
but she's also got to appear
non-threatening to the wife.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.510
It's a very delicate balance.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.146
Now that she's kissed some
ass, and given the husband

06:21.148 --> 06:24.316
a good eye fucking, we
get down to business.

06:24.318 --> 06:26.151
Proper walk through the house,

06:26.153 --> 06:27.452
special notes and attention

06:27.454 --> 06:30.756
to all the antiques,
the artwork,

06:30.758 --> 06:33.692
the high dollar
items, what have ya.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.994
And this becomes our
list, so if they say,

06:35.996 --> 06:38.063
oh be careful with this,
that means we are takin' it.

06:41.367 --> 06:44.169
Do you know any other
gig where the mark points

06:44.171 --> 06:46.905
out to you what to take?

06:46.907 --> 06:48.240
I don't think so.

06:48.242 --> 06:51.610
Trust established,
fake referrals,

06:51.612 --> 06:54.513
and our sweet little sales
rep gets in her Mercedes,

06:54.515 --> 06:59.151
and drives off back down
rich white people boulevard.

06:59.153 --> 07:01.853
But leave no loose ends.

07:01.855 --> 07:02.754
Nothing.

07:04.123 --> 07:07.426
Culpable deniability
i like to call it.

07:10.363 --> 07:11.363
Burn it all, move on.

07:15.201 --> 07:18.370
After the car's returned,
the phony contract

07:18.372 --> 07:22.841
with the personal information
plus the inventory list

07:22.843 --> 07:27.412
is mailed to a p.O box,
and the girl disappears.

07:27.414 --> 07:30.148
Different girl every time.

07:30.150 --> 07:34.219
So, when the marker's
left we schedule the move.

07:36.589 --> 07:39.324
Right, now, I am a business man.

07:41.027 --> 07:44.329
This is a business transaction.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.666
You've been vouched
for and I know

07:47.668 --> 07:50.535
that you do what you're told.

07:50.537 --> 07:52.771
But, the last thing we need

07:52.773 --> 07:55.207
is for your ass
to end up in jail,

07:55.209 --> 07:59.811
so you stay out of trouble,
I'll stay out of trouble.

07:59.813 --> 08:04.316
That's what life's all about,
right, stayin' out of trouble.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.017
Agree to the gig.

08:06.019 --> 08:09.955
We'll both sign this
probation completion form.

08:10.890 --> 08:12.123
There you go.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.625
Big head's gonna see
that you've fulfilled

08:13.627 --> 08:15.660
your obligation to
this great state.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.896
There's the bonus, 'cause,

08:19.031 --> 08:20.866
cut of the take comes
to you, the other cut

08:20.868 --> 08:24.536
comes to yours truly,
and let's just say,

08:24.538 --> 08:26.171
it's gonna be enough
to start that troubled

08:26.173 --> 08:28.173
life of yours all over.

08:30.543 --> 08:31.977
- You can take this contract

08:31.979 --> 08:34.813
and shove it up
your ass, Richie.

08:36.148 --> 08:39.751
Then you can take this pen
and shove it up your urethra.

08:43.389 --> 08:46.191
I'll finish my
hours and move on.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.455
Scott.

09:21.093 --> 09:21.927
Scott.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.228
Oy!

09:23.230 --> 09:24.763
The fuck are you doing?

09:24.765 --> 09:27.999
You were supposed to report
to the office half hour ago.

09:42.348 --> 09:43.582
What the fuck?

09:44.817 --> 09:46.818
Jury at work young man.

09:46.820 --> 09:50.121
You fail to show up i
will call your counselor.

09:50.123 --> 09:53.158
You do your work
and we'll be good.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.227
Thing is, we don't have
much work around here,

09:56.229 --> 09:58.463
but you guys are
cheap labor, so,

09:58.465 --> 10:00.632
if there's no work,
you're gonna move shit

10:00.634 --> 10:02.767
from one place to another.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.403
No forklift, no
machinery, just sweat,

10:05.405 --> 10:08.340
and you put yourself in
this particular predicament,

10:08.342 --> 10:11.376
so don't come crying to me.

10:11.378 --> 10:14.613
You do not talk to
these people, ever.

10:16.115 --> 10:20.385
This is a series of
interconnected buildings.

10:20.387 --> 10:23.154
This is where they make things.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.556
There are pants,

10:26.225 --> 10:29.127
one shirt, one
pair of size 10's.

10:33.499 --> 10:36.401
I used some new stuff on you.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.470
It's sophisticated
humor young man.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.573
I'm sorry if it
went over your head.

10:41.575 --> 10:43.308
Oh those lazy fucks.

10:44.610 --> 10:48.580
Your work course is
incomplete, fucking typical.

10:50.449 --> 10:51.349
Sit down.

10:52.852 --> 10:53.752
Go on.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.661
Now it says here name,

11:03.496 --> 11:05.864
the asshole just puts Scott.

11:07.933 --> 11:10.101
- Yeah, it's my last name.

11:11.704 --> 11:14.539
Don't gimme shit
about it either.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.077
What?

11:21.547 --> 11:24.582
- Have I done something to you?

11:24.584 --> 11:25.517
No.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.819
Then don't give me attitude.

11:28.888 --> 11:31.189
Think you dumb little shit.

11:32.892 --> 11:35.093
I think I've been fairly
fuckin' fluffy with you

11:35.095 --> 11:37.829
if you ask my honest assessment.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.999
Alright, full name.

11:42.768 --> 11:45.804
- It's Nicholas Scott, n-i-c-h--

11:45.806 --> 11:49.641
- yes, I can spell, Nicholas.
- Good for you.

11:50.676 --> 11:53.978
- Well here's a
fucking first Nicholas.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.814
Your address reads as follows,

11:55.816 --> 11:59.117
go east six blocks of the
abandoned warehouse with

11:59.119 --> 12:03.354
the sign that says eastwick,
go north across the street.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.526
You can't make this shit up.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.962
It's the little house
with tons of steps

12:10.964 --> 12:14.866
up the steep hill and
post gripped rusty door.

12:20.005 --> 12:21.606
- Couldn't remember the address.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.241
- Right, obviously.

12:32.885 --> 12:34.352
Let me be clear.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.620
We have rules.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.023
It's what you might call
a zero tolerance policy,

12:39.025 --> 12:42.093
meaning zero tardies,
zero problems.

12:44.730 --> 12:46.698
You're on probation.

12:46.700 --> 12:50.502
This isn't a summer caddy
job at some country club.

12:50.504 --> 12:51.402
- Roger.

13:06.986 --> 13:08.753
- Then do your little
drawings in there,

13:08.755 --> 13:10.922
and not on the fucking walls.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.924
You can thank me later.

13:14.059 --> 13:16.995
Now fuck off, you
silly little shit.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.075
- God you're so loud.

13:31.077 --> 13:33.478
- That's it.
- You like it, you're so loud.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.579
- Come with me okay?

13:34.581 --> 13:36.214
Come with me.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.248
Okay?

13:37.250 --> 13:39.217
Come with me, okay.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.052
Say it, say it.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.020
- Yeah.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.488
- Say it.
- Yes.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.789
- Say what, yes what?
- I'm gonna come with you,

13:44.791 --> 13:45.623
yeah.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.695
- Oh yeah,
you're so loud.

13:50.697 --> 13:51.796
- Stop saying that.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.731
- Well I like it.
- Stop.

13:56.302 --> 13:57.836
- Well just keep going.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.904
- You got me all in my head,
I'm all self conscious now.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.739
- Well okay, okay,

14:01.741 --> 14:03.474
but just keep going.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.644
Come on, come on.

14:10.349 --> 14:11.916
- I'm done.

14:11.918 --> 14:14.219
I'm done fucking.
- What, you came?

14:14.221 --> 14:15.420
What, you came?

14:15.422 --> 14:17.922
Fuck nessa, now help me come.

14:18.991 --> 14:21.693
Well you said you
wanted to come together.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.027
- I'm done fuckin'.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.429
It's all about you.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.264
- Well help me, please.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.165
- No.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.500
- What, a blowjob?

14:29.502 --> 14:30.335
- Gross.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.169
- What, gross?

14:31.171 --> 14:32.170
I go down on you.

14:32.172 --> 14:33.671
- I'mma be late.

14:33.673 --> 14:36.407
Come on, gotta drop my baby off.

14:41.780 --> 14:42.714
Eat it.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.048
- I don't want it.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.584
- Come on, I know you're hungry.

14:46.586 --> 14:49.153
Look I'm not mad at you.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.221
Just eat it.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.027
For a sec?

14:56.029 --> 14:57.528
- Hell no.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.864
- Please just hold him,
i gotta get my jacket on.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.032
There you go.

15:06.505 --> 15:09.140
If you watch Mickey while
I'm at work I'll get you off.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.074
How's that?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.012
Come on, childcare's
so fucking expensive.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.513
It's a good deal.

15:15.515 --> 15:19.250
I'll even go down on you and
you know I hate that shit.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.818
And no swallowing.

15:26.926 --> 15:27.825
- No.

15:29.361 --> 15:30.361
- You suck.

19:16.788 --> 19:19.257
There are gonna be rules.

19:19.259 --> 19:22.093
You can't sleep in my bed.

19:22.095 --> 19:24.829
I ain't your girlfriend.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.064
- We do all that stuff and
i can't sleep in your bed?

19:27.066 --> 19:28.633
- It's called sex.

19:29.635 --> 19:31.969
And we need boundaries.

19:31.971 --> 19:34.172
Really, you're gonna run
up in here asking for help,

19:34.174 --> 19:36.807
and you're gonna argue with me?

19:37.809 --> 19:38.776
- I get it.

19:39.711 --> 19:41.145
Got it.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.813
- Can you pay rent?

19:46.218 --> 19:47.752
No?

19:47.754 --> 19:49.053
- Oh come on, you
know I got nothing.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.621
- Well then you watch
Mickey when I'm at work!

19:50.623 --> 19:51.822
- No!

19:51.824 --> 19:53.891
- Well get out then.

19:53.893 --> 19:54.859
I promise I won't
be missing you.

19:54.861 --> 19:55.760
- I can't.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.499
I can't, I can't do it.

20:01.501 --> 20:05.570
I mean it, I don't wanna
live like that anymore.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.575
Help me out.

20:10.577 --> 20:14.579
- Okay, well just take
it or leave it, alright?

20:15.647 --> 20:18.382
You know I work at night, right?

20:19.251 --> 20:20.618
Come on baby.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.320
If you're here,

20:22.322 --> 20:25.056
if you are here, when I wake up,

20:26.491 --> 20:28.226
then we have a deal.

20:29.194 --> 20:32.096
If not, just get out of my life,

20:32.098 --> 20:33.164
and don't say a thing.

20:33.166 --> 20:34.799
- I didn't.

20:35.834 --> 20:37.235
- You wanted to.

22:57.743 --> 22:59.643
- Margaret,
it's principal hargrove.

23:01.413 --> 23:04.682
I understand what you've been,

23:04.684 --> 23:07.985
actually, I can't put
myself in your position.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.754
And everyone here at school,

23:09.756 --> 23:12.523
we know it's hard
for you right now.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.725
It's just that it's
been a long time now,

23:14.727 --> 23:17.695
and we need to hear
from you, soon.

23:17.697 --> 23:20.398
At some point we have to
get you back full time,

23:20.400 --> 23:23.401
or unfortunately think about
replacing you permanently.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.301
I'm sorry.

24:47.185 --> 24:49.353
- Yeah, so it's broken,

24:49.355 --> 24:51.822
it doesn't work anymore.

24:51.824 --> 24:56.060
But I started the garden
that we always talked about.

24:59.197 --> 25:00.097
So, yeah.

25:04.469 --> 25:08.339
The garden is looking pretty
sad and can you just help me?

a way to till this garden.

25:30.128 --> 25:33.397
I mean it sounds
easy enough, but

25:33.399 --> 25:37.835
apparently it's not 'cause
i keep screwing it up.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.069
Umm, you know,

25:41.406 --> 25:44.208

your voicemail message?

26:17.142 --> 26:19.643
How is this supposed to work?

26:38.897 --> 26:40.297

- How's it feel?

26:40.299 --> 26:42.700
How's it feel to be
standin' there soaking wet?

26:42.702 --> 26:43.601
Tell me.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.905
- Not, not good.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.807
- That's how he feels.

26:57.415 --> 27:00.918
- He was crying and I was just
looking at him in the crib,

27:00.920 --> 27:02.987
and he was crying and I,

27:06.224 --> 27:08.392
I dunno, I didn't
know what to do.

27:08.394 --> 27:09.827
- So, you did nothing,

27:09.829 --> 27:12.730
you didn't feed him, you
didn't get his diaper changed?

27:12.732 --> 27:14.198
Did you hold him?

27:15.433 --> 27:17.501
Come here baby.

27:17.503 --> 27:18.969
You couldn't even hold
him, couldn't even do that?

27:18.971 --> 27:21.171
- I don't know the first
thing about holding a baby.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.140
- Well it ain't an excuse.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.708
We all are fucked up.

27:24.710 --> 27:25.643
All of us.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.878
We all fucked up, everyone.

27:30.115 --> 27:31.649
There is no perfect.

27:41.292 --> 27:42.192
My uncle,

27:43.561 --> 27:46.497
he did some shit to me, every
night for years, for years,

27:46.499 --> 27:49.333
and I didn't say shit to
anyone, I just took it,

27:49.335 --> 27:53.370
'cause we didn't have shit,
so we were living with him.

27:53.372 --> 27:56.774
And so, it was take it from him,

27:56.776 --> 27:58.542
or put my little sisters
and my mom and my daddy

27:58.544 --> 28:02.246
out in the streets, and
i was not gonna be blamed

28:02.248 --> 28:06.283
for my family not having
a roof over our heads.

28:06.285 --> 28:09.119
That little girl, so I'm
fucked up, I'm fucked up,

28:09.121 --> 28:11.789
just like everybody, you know,

28:11.791 --> 28:13.524
just like you dude.

28:20.298 --> 28:21.465
And you know,

28:24.102 --> 28:27.871
when I have some
guy's dick inside me

28:27.873 --> 28:29.039
I feel loved,

28:30.642 --> 28:32.810
and that's the only time.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.291
- Is it like a
Harley or something?

29:21.293 --> 29:22.259
- Fuck off.

29:24.229 --> 29:27.965
Bunch of pussy lawyer
wannabes ride harleys.

29:29.300 --> 29:32.703
I'm a lot of things, but
I'm not some fucking lawyer

29:32.705 --> 29:36.273
pretending to be a
bad ass on Saturdays.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.075
You know, growing some
handlebar mustache

29:38.077 --> 29:42.679
for one triumphant week at
the hills of south Dakota.

29:42.681 --> 29:43.747
It's not me.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.852
- Is it like, it's good?

29:50.321 --> 29:52.890
But you know, is it
like a, a nice bike or--

29:52.892 --> 29:55.793
- oh, yeah, it's
pretty top notch.

29:56.895 --> 29:59.229
Maybe one day I'll
let you ride it.

29:59.231 --> 30:01.598
Listen kid, I wanna
say something,

30:01.600 --> 30:05.669
and uh, I say this with
love because I like you,

30:07.038 --> 30:10.274
you remind me of myself
when I was young.

30:10.276 --> 30:12.843
A lot like myself, but

30:12.845 --> 30:16.079
next time somebody does
something nice for you,

30:16.081 --> 30:19.383
let's say you know, for example,
hypothetically speaking,

30:19.385 --> 30:21.552
if someone felt a
little bit sorry for you

30:21.554 --> 30:23.453
and gave you one
of his sandwiches,

30:23.455 --> 30:27.424
I would say a proper thank
you would be in order.

30:27.426 --> 30:31.962
I would say that would be a
good time to be considerate.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.897
Don't say it now,
because in this case

30:33.899 --> 30:37.134
better late than
never does not apply.

31:15.907 --> 31:18.208
- Here, you want this shit?

31:19.811 --> 31:21.311
What?

31:21.313 --> 31:22.212
This?

31:24.883 --> 31:28.385
Oh, okay, you like
that shit, huh?

31:30.756 --> 31:32.589
I'm sorry I won't say it.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.560
I won't say shit anymore.

31:41.232 --> 31:42.633
Yeah you got it.

32:48.199 --> 32:50.600
- My feet are big and wide,

32:50.602 --> 32:53.003
but the city is tiny inside.

32:55.173 --> 32:57.341
My legs are lanky and tall,

32:57.343 --> 33:00.143
but the city is
little and small.

33:01.245 --> 33:04.881
My body is enormous and
the country is mini.

33:04.883 --> 33:09.319
My steps stretch forever
and the land is so short.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.756
My days are long and
my friends are none.

33:12.758 --> 33:16.593
Lying under the stars one
night, a wee little bitty

33:16.595 --> 33:20.497
tiny fella sat in a
tree and called to me.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.599
Why the huge frown?

33:22.601 --> 33:26.670
Everything I do is big,
just look at me, I said.

33:28.072 --> 33:31.675
I'm too small, said the wee
little bitty tiny fella.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.344
- Well people look at
me with gigantic eyes

33:34.346 --> 33:37.347
and wide mouths, and those
look pretty big to me,

33:37.349 --> 33:40.951
even though they
are tiny, I said.

33:40.953 --> 33:43.653
People don't look
at me much at all,

33:43.655 --> 33:45.889
and that's when the wee
little bitty tiny fella

33:45.891 --> 33:49.059
told me, but if you were
small, you'd be just like

33:49.061 --> 33:53.764
everyone else in a see of
smallies, just like me.

33:53.766 --> 33:57.501
Your feet wouldn't be big,
your legs wouldn't be lanky,

33:57.503 --> 34:01.171
and your body
wouldn't be enormous.

34:01.173 --> 34:03.273
He climbed down a
tree limb or two,

34:03.275 --> 34:05.542
shimmied onto a branch
in front of my ear,

34:05.544 --> 34:10.047
and whispered, but you can
be great no matter your size.

34:10.049 --> 34:14.284
You can be great and tall and
you can be great and small.

34:16.821 --> 34:18.989
Then the little fella
shimmied down the tree

34:18.991 --> 34:22.125
as quick as can be, and
ran away with his tiny legs

34:22.127 --> 34:26.362
all a blur until he was too
tiny for my big eyes to see.

34:27.732 --> 34:30.699
I thought long and hard about
what the little fella said,

34:30.702 --> 34:33.036
and then it hit me.

34:33.038 --> 34:36.473
What you see is not
what you have to be.

34:36.475 --> 34:40.944
There's plenty of room for us
all in the whole wide world,

34:40.946 --> 34:42.679
great and the small.

34:46.516 --> 34:47.417
The end.

34:53.025 --> 34:55.324
- Now we see stuff
that will get your rocks off.

34:56.627 --> 34:59.629
Basketball courts
and indoor pools,

35:00.932 --> 35:02.232
home theaters.

35:06.471 --> 35:09.706
All the artwork, all the
memorabilia, all the furniture,

35:09.708 --> 35:14.211
all the stuff that's money,
just load it onto the truck.

35:14.213 --> 35:17.013
We move fast, we
move calculated.

35:18.149 --> 35:21.351
It's what I like to
call being on point.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.754
Truck's loaded up,
driven out of the city

35:24.756 --> 35:27.557
to a secure location where
the drop off takes place.

35:27.559 --> 35:31.194
Whole truck, axles and
all, nice and clean.

35:32.663 --> 35:34.664
And then we get paid.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.066
- And that's it?

35:36.868 --> 35:38.335
You get away with that shit?

35:38.337 --> 35:40.737
- Oh, fuck you talkin' about,
i haven't been caught yet.

35:40.739 --> 35:44.141
You question too much, that's
your motherfuckin' problem.

35:44.143 --> 35:46.376
Bulletproof, this plan is.

35:47.745 --> 35:50.614
- I don't usually draw stuff
like this, so, don't judge me.

35:50.616 --> 35:52.916
- Please step aside, go on.

36:00.558 --> 36:02.259
Bloody hell.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.326
- What?

36:03.328 --> 36:05.495
Man that's what you asked for.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.063
What, you hate it?

36:16.374 --> 36:18.208
- No, I love it.

36:18.210 --> 36:19.109
Yeah.

36:20.611 --> 36:21.978
Yeah, I love it.

36:23.080 --> 36:26.316
That shit deserves
to be in the louvre.

36:26.318 --> 36:28.118
It's a famous museum.

36:29.287 --> 36:30.854
See, here we go again,

36:30.856 --> 36:34.925
I'm paying you a compliment,
you say thank you.

36:34.927 --> 36:36.193
- Thanks man.

36:36.195 --> 36:39.462
- What part of thank
you do you not get?

36:41.832 --> 36:42.966
- Thank you.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.201
- Hey, better!

36:46.437 --> 36:47.637
Alright.

36:47.639 --> 36:51.308
Deal's a deal, I'm a
man of me word, come on.

36:53.010 --> 36:54.711
You know, you're special
if I'm even lettin' you sit

36:54.713 --> 36:56.913
on this, and I don't want
you to be one of those little

36:56.915 --> 36:59.482
fuckin' sponges you
wash the dishes with.

36:59.484 --> 37:02.285
I need you to be a big
fucking fluffy sponge

37:02.287 --> 37:04.387
you wash the car with, alright?

37:04.389 --> 37:05.722
- Clutch starter.
- Yep.

37:05.724 --> 37:06.890
- Gear shift.

37:07.858 --> 37:09.226
No fucking lies.

37:10.328 --> 37:13.363
- Front break lever
controls front breaks.

37:13.365 --> 37:17.367
Rear brake pedal
controls rear brakes.

37:17.369 --> 37:21.871
The throttle there, what
do you think that does?

37:21.873 --> 37:23.006
- It's the speed?

37:23.008 --> 37:25.208
- Speed, yeah,
alright, to simplify,

37:25.210 --> 37:28.378
left side of the bike
controls the gears,

37:28.380 --> 37:32.616
right side of the bike controls
acceleration, and braking.

37:34.051 --> 37:34.050
Riding her,

37:36.854 --> 37:40.757
like riding a woman, or
like riding a bicycle.

37:42.126 --> 37:45.095
Fuckin' babies ride
bicycles, right?

37:49.233 --> 37:51.901
Have you ever ridden a bicycle?

37:55.707 --> 37:58.141
No, get the fuck off my bike.

37:59.143 --> 38:00.043
Go on.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.588
- Do you have a bike?

38:12.757 --> 38:14.891
Bicycle, do you have one?

38:16.661 --> 38:17.560
Do you?

38:18.896 --> 38:20.130
- You gonna ride that
bike Scott, or is it gonna

38:20.132 --> 38:24.334
walk you around the
block five more times?

38:24.336 --> 38:25.235
- Okay.

38:26.070 --> 38:28.071
I'll ride it this time.

38:29.173 --> 38:30.507
- You can do it, you
can do it, just pedal,

38:30.509 --> 38:31.975
just keep pedaling okay?

38:31.977 --> 38:35.478
Pedal, pedal, pedal,
pedal, pedal, pedal, pedal!

38:35.480 --> 38:36.713
You can do it!

38:36.715 --> 38:38.615
No, don't hit the car!

40:18.149 --> 40:19.549
You're talented.

40:21.952 --> 40:23.186
I'm turned on.

40:27.358 --> 40:30.593
Not like corny turned on you
know, just impressed turned on.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.395
- Really?

40:32.397 --> 40:33.930
- Yeah.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.432
- I thought it was my hair
you liked all these years.

40:35.434 --> 40:36.332
- Mmm.

40:41.939 --> 40:42.839
Maybe.

40:48.679 --> 40:50.513
This is funny, right?

40:52.149 --> 40:53.483
- Sure.

40:57.054 --> 41:00.457
- I'll never forget
being a little kid.

41:00.459 --> 41:04.694
In fourth grade, in Mrs.
slauder's class, remember?

41:07.331 --> 41:11.501
You started late, like
months after we all started.

41:14.438 --> 41:17.240
And you were so sad after
your mom dropped you off,

41:17.242 --> 41:20.143
and you came and
you sat next to me.

41:20.145 --> 41:21.044
Yep.

41:23.013 --> 41:24.514
Big crush on you.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.789
I wanted you to be happy then.

41:37.895 --> 41:41.731
Am I a dumbass for hoping
for your happiness?

41:44.768 --> 41:46.603
Do you remember that?

41:51.242 --> 41:54.143
- I don't even remember her.

41:54.145 --> 41:56.045
- Mrs. slauder?

41:59.517 --> 42:00.416
- My mom.

42:31.181 --> 42:32.081
Okay.

42:34.184 --> 42:35.852
How's that, better?

42:36.754 --> 42:37.620
- Yeah.

42:38.689 --> 42:40.256
It's a lot better.

42:53.704 --> 42:54.604
Come here.

43:04.481 --> 43:05.715
You know I uh,

43:07.418 --> 43:08.751
I saw the baby.

43:10.387 --> 43:11.955
I wasn't going to.

43:15.125 --> 43:18.361
I told them to take it
away, take him away but,

43:18.363 --> 43:20.763
but then I heard him crying.

43:21.899 --> 43:25.902
And it was like, it was
like this scream crying,

43:26.870 --> 43:29.205
and I never heard that before.

43:29.207 --> 43:30.106
But,

43:31.475 --> 43:35.578
it was as if I knew, only a
mommy holding it would fix it,

43:37.281 --> 43:40.283
so, so I demanded
to see that baby.

43:42.419 --> 43:43.319
And then,

43:45.756 --> 43:48.157
and then I was holding our,

43:49.693 --> 43:52.428
you know, I was
holding him and uh,

43:55.099 --> 43:59.335
I just want you to know
that you woulda loved him.

44:05.342 --> 44:07.176
- I'm sorry.

44:07.178 --> 44:08.845
- For what?

44:08.847 --> 44:10.279
- For doing that.

44:11.982 --> 44:14.150
Making you give him away.

44:16.487 --> 44:19.555
- Well he went to a
great home, I promise.

44:19.557 --> 44:21.891
The social worker, this
lady, she went and took me

44:21.893 --> 44:24.060
to meet, to meet the lady

44:26.697 --> 44:28.498
before he was born
'cause I wanted

44:28.500 --> 44:31.401
to be sure that
he'd be okay, so,

44:31.403 --> 44:33.936
I went and I met
her, and I saw her.

44:33.938 --> 44:36.239
She lived in brookstone
near some park.

44:36.241 --> 44:37.907
She kept talkin' 'bout
how it would be so great

44:37.909 --> 44:41.811
'cause he'd be able to go
around the corner to this park.

44:41.813 --> 44:45.148
Her and her husband
talked for forever,

44:45.150 --> 44:46.049
I didn't.

44:47.184 --> 44:49.118
I only remember that
part about the park.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.587
I didn't hear any more of it.

44:54.091 --> 44:55.658
- What's her name?

44:57.661 --> 44:58.661
- Margaret.

45:01.298 --> 45:03.700
I'm never gonna forget that.

45:04.935 --> 45:06.002
Get in here.

45:30.427 --> 45:32.662
- I wish I could meet him,

45:33.764 --> 45:34.664
my kid.

45:38.569 --> 45:40.303
- You can't.

46:35.225 --> 46:37.059
- What are you doing?

46:37.995 --> 46:40.563
What in the heck are you doing?

46:40.565 --> 46:44.167
I'm sorry but, but,
but what are you doing?

46:44.169 --> 46:45.735
- Lady, calm down.

46:47.004 --> 46:49.005
- Don't tell me to calm down.

46:49.007 --> 46:50.873
Don't you tell me to calm down.

46:50.875 --> 46:53.910
Do not get to tell
me to calm down!

46:53.912 --> 46:55.478
Because you don't know me,

46:55.480 --> 46:57.013
and you don't get to
tell me to calm down,

46:57.015 --> 47:00.316
so don't tell me to calm down!

47:00.318 --> 47:01.317
- Okay.

47:01.319 --> 47:02.218
Okay.

47:18.068 --> 47:20.536
- I spilled my tea on you.

47:20.538 --> 47:22.371
- You threw it at me.

47:26.910 --> 47:27.810
Lady,

47:28.679 --> 47:29.579
you okay?

47:32.482 --> 47:35.484
- I don't want you
to call me lady.

47:36.620 --> 47:39.422
I just wanna know
what you're doing.

47:41.859 --> 47:42.758
- Um,

47:44.661 --> 47:45.561
I um,

47:46.697 --> 47:49.565
I'm looking for a friend.

47:49.567 --> 47:52.034
I think he lives around here.

47:55.739 --> 47:57.707
- He doesn't live here.

48:19.196 --> 48:20.196
- Margaret?

48:27.404 --> 48:28.304
It's me.

48:32.809 --> 48:33.876
We just met.

48:40.450 --> 48:42.084
Margaret?

48:42.086 --> 48:43.920
- Go away.

48:46.023 --> 48:47.590
- We need to talk.

48:50.460 --> 48:51.861
We need to talk.

48:53.764 --> 48:55.197
- Get out.

48:55.199 --> 48:57.333
Get out of here.

48:57.335 --> 49:00.836
I'm calling the police,
I'm calling right now!

49:00.838 --> 49:03.472
- Don't, don't, stop calling,
don't call the police.

49:03.474 --> 49:04.440
- Get
out of my house!

49:04.442 --> 49:06.642
- I, I, I need to talk to you!

49:06.644 --> 49:08.778
- No, you don't!

49:08.780 --> 49:10.613
- It's about the baby.

49:30.067 --> 49:31.801
- So, this girl, um,

49:36.273 --> 49:38.341
are you living with her,

49:39.543 --> 49:42.979
or you're just, you're
staying with her?

49:42.981 --> 49:45.114
- Yeah, I'm just staying.

49:45.116 --> 49:46.215
- Okay.

49:46.217 --> 49:47.316
- But we're,

49:47.318 --> 49:49.418
we're just friends now.

49:49.420 --> 49:51.053
- Hmm.

49:51.055 --> 49:51.954
- She uh,

49:53.757 --> 49:54.657
well, she,

49:56.326 --> 50:00.563
she won't really let me play
around with her anymore.

50:04.601 --> 50:04.600
- Oh, but,

50:07.571 --> 50:10.339
play around with her,
you mean, she won't,

50:10.341 --> 50:14.243
she won't let you have
sex with her anymore?

50:14.245 --> 50:15.144
- Yeah.

50:16.480 --> 50:18.781
I guess that's what I mean.

50:21.385 --> 50:22.284
- So,

50:23.887 --> 50:28.124
if you're not staying with
her then where do you stay?

50:31.561 --> 50:32.461
- Just

50:33.430 --> 50:33.796
wherever.

50:37.334 --> 50:39.635
- Do you mean with friends?

50:40.971 --> 50:42.204
- Just around.

50:46.743 --> 50:48.310
- Do you like tea?

50:52.582 --> 50:54.216
- Um, where's the baby?

51:02.626 --> 51:06.362
- Um, I think you're
not gonna know

51:06.364 --> 51:08.297
if, if you like your
tea if you don't try it.

51:08.299 --> 51:10.533
- No, I don't want any tea.

51:11.768 --> 51:11.767
Where is he?

51:14.237 --> 51:17.640
I came here, I just wanna
know something about him.

51:17.642 --> 51:19.475
So if you could just tell
me anything it would be--

51:19.477 --> 51:23.312
- well I think our
time here is, is done

51:23.314 --> 51:24.213
Scott, so.

51:34.591 --> 51:35.658
- That's it?
- That's it.

51:43.166 --> 51:44.066
That's it.

51:48.472 --> 51:49.371
Scott.

51:59.116 --> 52:00.015
Levi.

52:02.419 --> 52:04.753
That's his name, it's Levi.

52:15.932 --> 52:16.999
- I like it.

52:24.941 --> 52:26.442
It's a good name.

52:39.923 --> 52:42.625
- The woman was so friendly,

52:42.627 --> 52:45.694
and she seemed very,
very legitimate.

52:47.063 --> 52:50.266
The whole thing seemed kind of
odd, actually, looking back.

52:50.268 --> 52:52.501
We've moved so many
times over the years,

52:52.503 --> 52:54.703
and I've always had
the best experiences,

52:54.705 --> 52:57.873
but I've never had anyone
follow me through the house

52:57.875 --> 53:01.544
asking me what was
important over and over.

53:01.546 --> 53:03.078
You know?

53:03.080 --> 53:04.547
Looking back I think she was
definitely making a list,

53:04.549 --> 53:07.616
and I have made you a very
extensive list of all the things

53:07.618 --> 53:10.853
that are missing that
i would like returned.

53:10.855 --> 53:13.355
Yeah, all of the
artwork is missing,

53:13.357 --> 53:15.124
and just between you and me,

53:15.126 --> 53:17.193
expressionism gives
me a headache,

53:17.195 --> 53:19.361
and cubism gives
me night terrors,

53:19.363 --> 53:22.097
but I didn't let my
ex-husband keep his art,

53:22.099 --> 53:24.700
so I will be damned if
some little criminal

53:24.702 --> 53:27.169
is gonna get to keep
it and enjoy it.

53:27.171 --> 53:28.771
No way.

53:29.907 --> 53:31.740
So what do you think?

53:34.211 --> 53:38.113
It's like over a million
dollars, just in art.

54:11.414 --> 54:12.815
So that's basically it.

54:12.817 --> 54:15.451
Don't you think a full
investigation is needed?

54:15.453 --> 54:17.286
I mean I've been robbed blind.

54:17.288 --> 54:19.488
Blind, this is a scam,
it's a total scam,

54:19.490 --> 54:22.258
and it needs to stop, and
i need my things back.

54:22.260 --> 54:25.527
I need my prized possessions
retrieved immediately.

54:25.529 --> 54:27.429
- Yeah, I hear you sweetie.

54:27.431 --> 54:31.767
The sun don't shine on an
ass's mule during a full moon.

54:31.769 --> 54:34.403
And I would like to offer
you my great apologies

54:34.405 --> 54:37.039
Ms. Caldwell, and I'd like
to promise you, that I,

54:37.041 --> 54:40.109
detective dupre will do
my utter best to bring

54:40.111 --> 54:43.212
this investigation to
its full conclusion.

54:43.214 --> 54:45.914
Now as to your things,
your prized possessions

54:45.916 --> 54:48.684
which you would like to
have returned to you,

54:48.686 --> 54:52.421
it greatly pains me to tell
you that I cannot do that.

54:52.423 --> 54:54.690
What a pleasure it
was to meet you.

54:54.692 --> 54:58.560
This is a beautiful home,
a gorgeous home really.

54:58.562 --> 55:00.663
You are lovely, lovely people.

55:00.665 --> 55:02.164
- Hey,
lovely people my ass,

55:02.166 --> 55:04.366
aren't you going to take
pictures or fingerprints,

55:04.368 --> 55:05.768
or do something?

55:05.770 --> 55:08.270
- Oh that is very wise,
what you just said.

55:08.272 --> 55:10.773
Actually, that's
already been done.

55:10.775 --> 55:14.176
I don't do that kind of
gathering of material.

55:14.178 --> 55:16.612
No, what I tend to do
is I study it, you see,

55:16.614 --> 55:20.316
I interpret it or
analyze it if you will.

55:20.318 --> 55:24.219
Okay, i'mma check one
thing first before I go.

55:26.056 --> 55:29.625
I see here, where
do I have that?

55:29.627 --> 55:30.626
No.

55:30.628 --> 55:32.027
Oh here we go.

55:32.029 --> 55:35.597
So you went on your
vacation October five,

55:36.966 --> 55:40.235
and then you scheduled
your move for October 7th.

55:40.237 --> 55:41.070
That correct?

55:41.072 --> 55:42.971
- Yes.

55:42.973 --> 55:43.872
- Okay.

55:46.543 --> 55:47.443
Oh wow.

55:50.780 --> 55:52.414
May I, do you mind?

56:38.027 --> 56:39.395
- Pow.

56:41.832 --> 56:43.432
Yeah.

57:03.921 --> 57:04.753
- yeah.

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:58.954
- Well, they
do live like kings.

01:00:58.956 --> 01:01:00.589
- Oh yeah.

01:01:00.591 --> 01:01:03.125
It's just fucking
money though, ain't it?

01:01:03.127 --> 01:01:05.060
You see that, right there?

01:01:05.062 --> 01:01:06.328
- They're home?

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:09.931
- Yeah, it's part of
the plan, come on.

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:13.835
Just grow a pair of fucking
balls and come on walk.

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.303
Hold the Bible up,
hold the Bible up.

01:01:15.305 --> 01:01:16.538
- What?

01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:19.474
- Hope the fucking
Bible up and smile.

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:23.278
- Ah, sorry we got lost.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.516
But the good lord has once
again guided us to safety.

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:32.254
Do you have time for Jesus?

01:01:32.256 --> 01:01:33.155
- No.

01:01:34.857 --> 01:01:37.359
- You going on vacation?

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:38.860
- Moving.

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:39.761
Good luck.

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:43.365
- You going to Europe?

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:44.733
- Belize.

01:01:44.735 --> 01:01:47.135
Spent enough time in Europe.

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:49.738
- Where's Belize?

01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:50.706
- Fuck do I know?

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:52.107
- I love Belize.

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:54.242
- Fuck.
- What?

01:01:58.014 --> 01:02:01.249
So walking through the house,
we first assess the house.

01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:03.919
Bottom floor first and
from there we head up.

01:02:03.921 --> 01:02:05.253
Oh and that includes
the basement.

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:06.521
- If?

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:08.957
- If they
have a basement.

01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:11.993
If in the case of a lower
level or what some might refer

01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:15.530
to as a basement, that
is our starting point.

01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:16.798
- Very nice.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.402
Sounding a lot like you
know what you're doing.

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.270
You sound like Richie rich.

01:02:22.272 --> 01:02:23.905
I like how I sound.

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:27.476
- Yeah, it's a visual
and verbal assessment

01:02:27.478 --> 01:02:28.810
of what we will be taking.

01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:31.279
Once the top floor
assessment is complete,

01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:33.515
we fill the truck with the
heavy items where two men,

01:02:33.517 --> 01:02:35.317
meaning you and I, are required,

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:37.686
always working now top
floor to bottom floor

01:02:37.688 --> 01:02:39.054
for deficient purposes.

01:02:39.056 --> 01:02:42.557
- For efficient reasons,
for fuck's sake.

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:45.460
- Efficient reasons.

01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:47.462
- You'll get it.

01:02:47.464 --> 01:02:49.364
- Efficient reasons,
you're right.

01:02:49.366 --> 01:02:51.133
Right, we then go solo
on the smaller items

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:52.434
and work our way back up.

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:54.569
At that point I'll do a
once over the property,

01:02:54.571 --> 01:02:58.240
not with a fine tooth
comb, but just a swipe.

01:02:58.242 --> 01:02:59.975
- Swiffer sweeper like.

01:02:59.977 --> 01:03:02.110
- Right, swiffer
sweep of the house.

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:03.545
You'll be securing the vehicle

01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:07.048
and activating the
security system.

01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:08.316
- Yeah.

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:09.284
You got it.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.255
I'm proud of you son.

01:03:16.759 --> 01:03:18.560
Now at two P.M.

01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:21.363
You'll pull the truck
over where I tell ya,

01:03:21.365 --> 01:03:23.198
I'll get out the truck,
we'll go around a building,

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.867
down an alley, get on me bike,

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:29.037
arrive back at the
warehouse at 2:15 P.M.

01:03:29.039 --> 01:03:33.642
You'll reach the
predetermined drop-off point,

01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:36.678
address the follow later, and
by the time the transaction

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.748
takes place, big head's
monthly scheduled

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:42.150
three P.M. drop-by will
have already occurred.

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:44.419
I'll have you signed
off on the books,

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:46.822
time served, probation over.

01:03:48.157 --> 01:03:50.859
And thanks to me
you'll have 15,000

01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:53.228
tax free dollars in your pocket,

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:55.864
not that you know
anything about taxes.

01:03:55.866 --> 01:03:57.866
Now, this is important.

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:03.271
You will be picked up at
predetermined rendezvous boy,

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:05.607
you will be given a
ride into the city,

01:04:05.609 --> 01:04:07.008
you will be given your cut,

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:09.377
and then you and I cut ties.

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:13.348
- I don't even have
to talk to 'em.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:15.450
You know, they just
give me like a case,

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:19.020
or like a briefcase or a gym
bag, you know what I mean?

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:22.257
And at that point
all I gotta do is

01:04:22.259 --> 01:04:25.193
like walk about five miles.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:27.462
He said I gotta be
quick about it, but

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:32.033
that should be no problem, i
can run if I have to, you know.

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:35.103
Well whatever, that
ain't important.

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:37.539
The important part.

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:43.311
Nessa I get $15,000.

01:04:45.815 --> 01:04:47.649
Can you believe that shit?

01:04:47.651 --> 01:04:50.151
- I gotta
get ready for work.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:54.089
- Well, what do you think?

01:04:54.091 --> 01:04:57.092
- I think it's a
dumb, stupid idea.

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:01.463
What do you want me to do?

01:05:01.465 --> 01:05:02.898
You want me to jump for glory

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:04.699
'cause you make another
stupid decision in your life,

01:05:04.701 --> 01:05:06.434
'cause I'll do that.

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:10.305
Good job Scott, yay,
I'm so proud of you!

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:11.306
Good job!

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:13.608
Money, money, do it, do it.

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:18.480
You're the best
dipshit criminal ever.

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:25.053
We don't need you Scott.

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:29.524
We don't need you or the money.

01:05:32.295 --> 01:05:34.930
- I ain't giving you the money.

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:39.467
I'm giving the
money to Margaret.

01:05:40.736 --> 01:05:43.371
The lady that adopted the baby,

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.341
I want her to have it.

01:05:51.047 --> 01:05:53.048
- You went and saw her?

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.318
You talked to that lady?

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:58.620
- Yeah, that's why so,

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:01.022
I wanted to meet her.

01:06:01.024 --> 01:06:04.426
What's the deal?
- You wanted to see your kid?

01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:10.098
You're never gonna
fuckin' get it dude.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.733
You ain't ever gonna get it.

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:13.301
That was our baby.

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:15.370
That was supposed
to be our baby.

01:06:15.372 --> 01:06:17.372
But you didn't want it.

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:21.009
You didn't want it, or
me, you wanted to fuck me,

01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:23.912
but you didn't
wanna love me, huh?

01:06:28.217 --> 01:06:32.454
Wow, I'm a dumb bitch, i
am a dumb bitch, aren't I?

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:41.162
You know I started
thinking that,

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:46.368
I started thinking
that this baby,

01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:48.670
and me and you, that
we were gonna be like,

01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:50.605
I don't even know
how to say it like,

01:06:50.607 --> 01:06:53.508
it felt like it
was gonna be like,

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:57.812
how it was supposed
to be, like a family.

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:08.656
- I'm trying
to help someone.

01:07:08.658 --> 01:07:09.758
So I'm sorry.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.534
Don't.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.069
- Please leave.

01:07:21.071 --> 01:07:22.470
- Don't.

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:28.109
- You ain't ever gonna get it.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.435
- Get the fuck up.

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:44.439
- Well, where did
you sleep last night?

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:52.213
- Outside.

01:10:59.221 --> 01:11:01.889
- Well, you have nowhere to go.

01:11:03.025 --> 01:11:05.026
You have nowhere to go?

01:11:10.332 --> 01:11:12.734
Well I think I can help you.

01:11:14.069 --> 01:11:18.306
I'm sorry this is like, not
the greatest guest room.

01:11:20.142 --> 01:11:23.111
- Trust me it's a,
it's an upgrade.

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:26.114
- It's an upgrade?

01:11:26.116 --> 01:11:29.917
- Yeah, I ain't, i
ain't trespassing.

01:11:29.919 --> 01:11:30.818
- Oh.

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:36.024
Okay.

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:39.560
- Yeah.

01:11:42.264 --> 01:11:43.164
- Okay.

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:47.268
- You sure it's
okay that I stay?

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:52.240
You don't think it's all
like strange and shit?

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:56.644
- Strange because, why?

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.049
- Just,

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:04.919
why help me?

01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:10.491
- What do you think
is going on here?

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:14.929
I mean, look at me.

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:18.232
Do I look okay?

01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:21.102
Do things seem right?

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:28.676
- No you don't.

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:37.085
- He was, he was really
sick for a long time,

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.088
the baby was sick.

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:44.792
Then my husband left me, and,

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:47.228
well the baby died.

01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:56.838
What did you think
was going to happen

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.306
when you showed up here?

01:12:58.308 --> 01:13:00.942
Did you think you could
just come in and be his dad?

01:13:00.944 --> 01:13:04.045
- No, what, what
is it you think?!

01:13:04.047 --> 01:13:06.013
Huh, why are you
being nice to me?

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:08.983
You're hoping that
I'm gonna replace him?

01:13:08.985 --> 01:13:09.884
Is that it?

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:14.288
Trust me, I don't know shit,

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:16.958
I'm just some dumb fucking kid,

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:21.496
but you ain't the only one
who been through some shit.

01:13:21.498 --> 01:13:22.397
Right?

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:32.373
Lady, you're so fucked up

01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:35.943
you can't even tell
how fucked up you are.

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:45.353
- I told you not
to call me lady.

01:14:40.909 --> 01:14:41.809
Scott?

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:45.680
Um, Scott?

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:55.056
Well you were right.

01:14:56.758 --> 01:14:58.893
I am, I am all messed up.

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:05.700
- You can say fucked up, huh?

01:15:07.102 --> 01:15:08.836
I won't tell anyone.

01:15:12.074 --> 01:15:14.809
- Okay, I'm, I am all fucked up.

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:37.832
- Was he uh, was he
tall, like for his age?

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.702
- Yeah he was pretty tall.

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.672
He was pretty tall.

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:50.311
I guess kind of average.

01:15:54.449 --> 01:15:57.952
Average to tall, we used
to say that he was tall

01:15:57.954 --> 01:15:58.853
to him.

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:04.926
- And people liked him?

01:16:07.262 --> 01:16:09.530
- Yeah he was really funny.

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:11.899
He would just,

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:16.237
he thought it was
completely okay to just

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:18.573
ask questions to strangers.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:24.378
And I guess it was
pretty charming.

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:26.614
You know.

01:16:29.017 --> 01:16:31.586
It was embarrassing at times.

01:16:40.429 --> 01:16:41.329
Oh.

01:16:44.266 --> 01:16:47.401
I forgot about his
weird little walk.

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:53.207
He learned to walk when
he was eight months old

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:54.508
which is crazy,

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:56.978
he was just,

01:16:58.313 --> 01:17:02.249
and, it's not a good idea
for them to walk at that age.

01:17:02.251 --> 01:17:05.086
It's like driving a car
blindfolded or something.

01:17:05.088 --> 01:17:08.789
He's just like, like he's
just like drunk or something,

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:10.891
wandering, and too small.

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:19.266
Look his hair is so
thick for a baby.

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:21.636
So beautiful.

01:17:23.872 --> 01:17:24.939
Let me feel.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:31.779
Wow.

01:17:35.117 --> 01:17:38.853
That's so strange, i
guess he had your hair.

01:17:52.367 --> 01:17:55.603
- Levi, Levi
baby, how old are you today?

01:17:55.605 --> 01:17:56.871
- Four.

01:17:56.873 --> 01:17:59.974
- Oh come
on, how old are you?

01:17:59.976 --> 01:18:01.409
- Three.

01:18:01.411 --> 01:18:02.643
- That's right,

01:18:02.645 --> 01:18:04.345
and what happens on
your birthday sweetie?

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:05.713
- Cake?

01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:10.251
- Cake.

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:24.932
so, sweetie, Dr.
clarkson and the nurses

01:18:24.934 --> 01:18:26.801
have another surprise for you.

01:18:26.803 --> 01:18:31.272
It's a very, very special
friend of Dr. clarkson's.

01:18:31.274 --> 01:18:33.607
Oh.

01:18:33.609 --> 01:18:35.609
You're gonna cover your eyes.

01:18:35.611 --> 01:18:38.713
- Yes, I'm
covering my eyes.

01:18:38.715 --> 01:18:42.683
- Okay, but don't
look, don't look yet, okay?

01:18:42.685 --> 01:18:43.651
- Now?

01:18:43.653 --> 01:18:46.287
- No, not yet honey.

01:18:47.089 --> 01:18:47.988
Surprise!

01:19:22.624 --> 01:19:23.591
- Nicholas.

01:19:27.863 --> 01:19:28.763
Nicholas.

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:32.333
Nicholas!

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:36.036
Oh, you're up?

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:38.472
- It's Scott.

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:40.775
- No.

01:19:40.777 --> 01:19:43.177
You see I made a
choice last night,

01:19:43.179 --> 01:19:45.946
I refuse to call you Scott.

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:48.616
If I have to stop
running from my problems,

01:19:48.618 --> 01:19:52.853
then I think you should stop
running from your own name.

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:57.324
- Yeah, that's,
that's really deep.

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:00.728
- Clean start.

01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:03.697
- Yeah, clean start.

01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:07.401
- Margaret.

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:10.070
- Scott.

01:20:11.239 --> 01:20:12.706
- Nicholas.

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:15.309
- Yeah fine, Nicholas.

01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:16.277
- Nicholas.

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:26.320
- This is for me?

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:28.823
- Yeah.

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:34.061
Put a little ah, put a
little butter on top.

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:38.165
You're gonna want
more than that.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:40.935
Just take a whole
big piece of it.

01:20:40.937 --> 01:20:42.336
Yeah, that's it.

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:47.174
Okay now, just
spread it all over.

01:20:49.311 --> 01:20:51.178
Add a little to each layer,

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.914
like on each pancake going down.

01:20:59.554 --> 01:21:00.955
Pour it back and forth.

01:21:00.957 --> 01:21:03.257
Let it drip down the sides.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:08.762
Yeah,

01:21:10.899 --> 01:21:13.734
okay.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.507
- They look good.

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:24.879
Thank you.

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:31.485
- Yeah, I mean it's been a
while since I cooked for anyone.

01:21:32.621 --> 01:21:34.855
You're more than welcome.

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:52.673
- Oh, I see, okay,

01:21:52.675 --> 01:21:56.410
I'm using the knife i
guess, so it's okay.

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:57.311
Oh geez.

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:06.887
- Mmm.

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:08.989
Pancakes.

01:22:08.991 --> 01:22:12.059
- Yeah.

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:55.936
- I don't like these calls,

01:22:55.938 --> 01:22:57.805
I really don't.

01:22:57.807 --> 01:23:00.140
Squatting they call it.

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:01.775
You know, findin'
abandoned homes,

01:23:01.777 --> 01:23:04.111
homes for sale, foreclosures.

01:23:04.113 --> 01:23:06.447
This is detective dupre,
making the rent...

01:23:06.449 --> 01:23:09.383
Living where there
ain't nobody living.

01:23:09.385 --> 01:23:12.853
The economy, I would
say is the problem,

01:23:12.855 --> 01:23:15.489
it's the issue, not the people.

01:23:16.358 --> 01:23:18.492
A complete social breakdown,

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:21.161
bullshit is what I call it.

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:24.665
See, I come from the dirt,
and that's a way of life.

01:23:24.667 --> 01:23:27.468
Something I have
a big heart for.

01:23:30.438 --> 01:23:33.741
I watched him run
from the house.

01:23:33.743 --> 01:23:35.542
I did not give chase.

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:41.482
To be real with you, I was
very happy that he ran.

01:23:41.484 --> 01:23:43.050
One, I do not run,

01:23:44.152 --> 01:23:46.720
and two, I hate the
fucking paperwork.

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:48.355
Anyway, here he
was running through

01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:50.157
the snake infested woods.

01:23:50.159 --> 01:23:54.395
Oh my goodness, you know, like
that, that famous fairy tale,

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:58.699
to somebody's house
he goes, you know,

01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:02.936
over the mountain, through
the snake infested woods.

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:05.606
Eat up.

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:13.647
- Happy?

01:24:13.649 --> 01:24:15.115
- Happy?

01:24:15.117 --> 01:24:17.951
Did I upset you by
sharing my meal with you?

01:24:17.953 --> 01:24:19.686
- No, you haven't upset
me, it's just I've got

01:24:19.688 --> 01:24:23.924
a lot of work to do, and
um, to be honest, officer.

01:24:25.326 --> 01:24:28.629
- Oh no, no, sorry,
detective.

01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:30.731
I ain't never loved
that title you know.

01:24:30.733 --> 01:24:33.233
It's got too much dick in it,
do you know what I'm saying?

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:34.301
De-tec-tive.

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:39.406
- Yeah, detective.

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:42.743
Um, like you I've got a boss
breathing down my neck, and--

01:24:42.745 --> 01:24:43.944
- oh I understand.

01:24:43.946 --> 01:24:45.179
- Well you've been
sitting there,

01:24:45.181 --> 01:24:46.747
you've eaten half your
lunch and you're telling

01:24:46.749 --> 01:24:50.651
me some story about some
boy who lives in a house.

01:24:50.653 --> 01:24:52.619
- Yeah, Nicholas Scott.

01:24:54.856 --> 01:24:56.356
- What about him?

01:24:58.359 --> 01:25:00.360
- What's the hurry now?

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:05.299
Such a pushy little shit
you turned out to be.

01:25:05.301 --> 01:25:08.669
Can you not see I am looking
for information here?

01:25:08.671 --> 01:25:11.105
I know what I wrote.

01:25:11.107 --> 01:25:12.840
Beginning to wonder
in my little head.

01:25:12.842 --> 01:25:14.341
- Ain't little.

01:25:14.343 --> 01:25:17.878
- Oh, You know
what my daddy called it?

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.347
He called it a high forehead.

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:23.484
You better mind your mouth

01:25:23.486 --> 01:25:26.620
or I'm gonna have
to mind it for you.

01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:28.789
Nicholas Scott.

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:33.393
- He did
some service here.

01:25:33.395 --> 01:25:35.195
- Oh.
- We get a lot of people.

01:25:35.197 --> 01:25:37.197
- Well, where do he be?

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.634
Oh I didn't say that line
from the great fairy tale

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:42.603
for shits and giggles, about
going through the woods

01:25:42.605 --> 01:25:44.138
to somebody's house.

01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.038
Hmm?

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:48.542
Why'd you take so
long to tell me?

01:25:48.544 --> 01:25:49.943
Eat the carrots.

01:25:51.312 --> 01:25:54.181
Not gonna give you the mouth
orgasm that maybe a French fry

01:25:54.183 --> 01:25:58.418
would but it could give you
something to gnaw on, you know.

01:25:59.654 --> 01:26:03.891
- 
Yup, that's lovely.

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:08.829
- Yeah, I know.

01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:11.965
Who bullshittin' who here, huh?

01:26:11.967 --> 01:26:13.734
Oh here it is, here it be.

01:26:13.736 --> 01:26:17.037
Court order to
finish work release.

01:26:17.039 --> 01:26:19.006
Oh no sorry, probation,

01:26:20.241 --> 01:26:24.044
and the finish date is
January six, the fuck?

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:34.121
I don't see no Nicholas.

01:26:34.123 --> 01:26:35.856
And blind I am not.

01:26:35.858 --> 01:26:37.658
- He finished early.

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:41.228
Hard workin' type,
they do exist you know.

01:26:43.331 --> 01:26:44.565
- I found this

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:50.804
where Nicholas
used to be staying.

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:56.777
- Yeah, never seen it,

01:26:56.779 --> 01:27:00.013
but, yeah, they
look like drawings.

01:27:00.015 --> 01:27:02.282
- These are wonderful drawings.

01:27:02.284 --> 01:27:03.684
Wonderful.

01:27:03.686 --> 01:27:04.952
But you ain't never seen this?

01:27:04.954 --> 01:27:06.720
- Never seen said notebook.

01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:10.891
See, I can talk as well
detective, and I ain't special.

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:42.489
- Of course, he
could've just took it.

01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:45.926
You know maybe,

01:27:47.495 --> 01:27:50.330
he's not exactly
an angel, is he?

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.401
But then again who is?

01:27:56.271 --> 01:27:57.704
- What are you saying?

01:27:57.706 --> 01:27:59.873
- What am I saying?

01:27:59.875 --> 01:28:01.842
I ain't saying nothing.

01:28:03.578 --> 01:28:05.312
How do it be though?

01:28:07.348 --> 01:28:09.082
I, I know for a fact

01:28:15.356 --> 01:28:18.625
that Nicholas was working
here when he lost his home,

01:28:18.627 --> 01:28:19.693
or dwelling,

01:28:20.528 --> 01:28:21.895
let's call it dwelling,

01:28:21.897 --> 01:28:25.132
but you don't know
nothing about that?

01:28:26.534 --> 01:28:27.768
- Oh, hang on.

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:33.507
Here look.

01:28:36.644 --> 01:28:39.546
He wrote his address
down on the contract.

01:28:39.548 --> 01:28:41.148
- Ah.

01:28:41.150 --> 01:28:43.717
Oh my goodness,
well this is new.

01:28:43.719 --> 01:28:47.954
I sure as shit ain't gonna be
able to learn this address.

01:28:56.664 --> 01:28:58.965
That motorcycle
outside, that's yours?

01:28:58.967 --> 01:29:00.801
- Yup that's my bike.

01:29:01.703 --> 01:29:02.536
- A Harley?

01:29:02.538 --> 01:29:03.870
- No.

01:29:03.872 --> 01:29:04.771
- No shit.

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.141
Can I mount it?

01:29:08.976 --> 01:29:10.677
Can I feel it between my legs?

01:29:10.679 --> 01:29:11.578
- No.

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:17.818
- Well you cannot
fault me for trying.

01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:19.152
I'mma say that.

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:59.813
- You got a minute for
me Mr. Nicholas Scott?

01:32:01.415 --> 01:32:03.183
- Yeah, that's me.

01:32:03.185 --> 01:32:04.918
- Oh I ain't asking.

01:32:06.487 --> 01:32:08.889
I'm detective Candice dupre.

01:32:09.957 --> 01:32:13.426
Nice to finally
meet you in person.

01:32:13.428 --> 01:32:16.897
I feel like I already
done maybe met you.

01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:20.166
I can tell you that
I'm very interested

01:32:20.168 --> 01:32:22.402
in having a little
chat with you.

01:32:22.404 --> 01:32:24.971
And I can further tell you
and promise you young man,

01:32:24.973 --> 01:32:26.473
that your coming
with me right now

01:32:26.475 --> 01:32:28.408
is in your very best interest.

01:32:28.410 --> 01:32:32.212
This right here is me
making it easy for you.

01:32:33.314 --> 01:32:34.714
I have a very strong
feeling you know

01:32:34.716 --> 01:32:37.384
what I wanna talk to you about.

01:32:44.725 --> 01:32:48.261
Why don't you get
in that car with me.

01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.839
the hell is that, hey.

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:11.518
- what is this?

01:33:11.520 --> 01:33:12.786
- What is what?

01:33:12.788 --> 01:33:14.888
You mean what we're doing?

01:33:14.890 --> 01:33:17.290
Well what'd you think it is?

01:33:17.292 --> 01:33:19.926
I think that you have some idea

01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:23.263
of what brought me to you.

01:33:23.265 --> 01:33:25.832
I think you have
some stories for me.

01:33:25.834 --> 01:33:28.401
So I'm thinking
why don't we just

01:33:28.403 --> 01:33:32.372
go get you a cone at blue bell,
find a beautiful park bench,

01:33:32.374 --> 01:33:36.509
we just gon' sit down,
we gon' talk a minute.

01:33:40.415 --> 01:33:43.116
- I ran back through
the house as planned.

01:33:43.118 --> 01:33:45.952
You know, double checking and,

01:33:45.954 --> 01:33:49.422
and I stayed in this
bathroom for a while

01:33:50.424 --> 01:33:52.559
just staring at this tub.

01:33:55.496 --> 01:33:57.564
It was so big and empty.

01:34:00.601 --> 01:34:03.003
Like it had never been used.

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.041
I thought like my life.

01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:11.845
I start remember thinking,

01:34:14.615 --> 01:34:17.050
and the alarm was
being set so I,

01:34:17.052 --> 01:34:20.954
I walked back downstairs
and got in the truck,

01:34:23.157 --> 01:34:26.226
and I didn't even
say a word to him.

01:34:27.561 --> 01:34:28.461
And then

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:33.633
at that point I didn't know
what the fuck I was doing.

01:34:35.269 --> 01:34:38.004
- Take a bite of that ice cream.

01:34:50.384 --> 01:34:51.718
For your hands.

01:35:04.098 --> 01:35:04.998
Go ahead.

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:07.534
- Oh uh, yeah,

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:13.206
I did everything he told me.

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:17.677
After I dropped him off i
drove the truck out of a town

01:35:17.679 --> 01:35:19.813
in the middle of nowhere,

01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:25.819
and it was just like he
said, there were two dudes,

01:35:25.821 --> 01:35:29.522
and no words spoken,
the bag handed over,

01:35:29.524 --> 01:35:33.793
and I opened it in front
of him, you know, to count,

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:37.797
and truth is I didn't
count that shit.

01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:45.071
It's more money than I ever saw.

01:35:45.073 --> 01:35:48.208
I guess I just, i
looked over it and,

01:35:49.243 --> 01:35:50.410
you know, like i
knew what I was doing

01:35:50.412 --> 01:35:52.312
and shit or something,

01:35:55.182 --> 01:35:56.750
and then I walked,

01:35:58.018 --> 01:35:59.018
and walked.

01:36:01.155 --> 01:36:04.758
I walked like five
fucking miles through

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:08.328
these shit ass fields
and over tracks and,

01:36:11.899 --> 01:36:13.299
and there he was

01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:17.003
waiting for me,

01:36:18.339 --> 01:36:20.406
right there on his bike.

01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:27.914
And, you know I'll never forget,
I'm walking up to him and

01:36:27.916 --> 01:36:32.018
I'm getting on the bike
and I can't help but,

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:35.188
you know, kinda
crack a smile 'cause,

01:36:37.391 --> 01:36:40.794
yeah I knew I'd done
something wrong but

01:36:43.497 --> 01:36:46.966
I was about to do
something really right.

01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:52.739
And you know, we drove off.

01:37:03.517 --> 01:37:06.686
- I miss ice cream
so much, you know.

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:39.853
- I didn't take the money.

01:37:41.088 --> 01:37:43.990
That's um, that's
the right thing,

01:37:45.559 --> 01:37:47.460
the right thing I did.

01:37:53.934 --> 01:37:56.402
- Is this the house?
- Hmm.

01:37:56.404 --> 01:37:58.137
- Yes or no?

01:37:58.139 --> 01:37:59.038
- Yes.

01:38:04.078 --> 01:38:06.479
- You didn't take the money?

01:38:07.848 --> 01:38:10.016
- Didn't want that shit.

01:38:12.152 --> 01:38:15.321
- That is a very
sweet thing to hear.

01:38:18.292 --> 01:38:19.792
- Yeah.

01:38:19.794 --> 01:38:23.897
- One time when I was up in
high school my girlfriend,

01:38:25.032 --> 01:38:29.602
that is girl who was my
friend, I only had one,

01:38:29.604 --> 01:38:32.839
one too many, and
she done lied to me,

01:38:36.644 --> 01:38:38.711
and almost took me down.

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:41.180
Hurt my feelings,

01:38:41.949 --> 01:38:42.916
uh, so bad.

01:38:45.486 --> 01:38:49.722
So finally my daddy sat
down and had a talk with me.

01:38:51.125 --> 01:38:53.359
He was good at that,
you know, he was deep,

01:38:53.361 --> 01:38:56.429
and he understood,
and he was clear.

01:38:57.998 --> 01:39:02.168
He said to me you knew when
you made her your friend

01:39:02.170 --> 01:39:03.903
that she was a liar.

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:06.673
That's deep.

01:39:08.742 --> 01:39:09.776
Think on it.

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:12.979
I did.

01:39:24.058 --> 01:39:25.959
Take it in your hands.

01:39:42.209 --> 01:39:43.276
That's real.

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:47.947
That is real.
