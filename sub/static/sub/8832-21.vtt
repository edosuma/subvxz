MANHATTAN, CELEBRATING THE 100th

00:28.900 --> 00:31.333
EPISODE OF "IMPRACTICAL JOKERS."

00:31.333 --> 00:33.133
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT HERE IN

00:33.133 --> 00:36.400
NEW YORK CITY.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.067
WE'VE GOT AN AMAZING CROWD RIGHT

00:39.067 --> 00:40.367
HERE.

00:40.367 --> 00:42.167
THE JOKERS ARRIVED HERE EARLIER

00:42.167 --> 00:43.900
TODAY AND WERE GREETED BY SOME

00:43.900 --> 00:45.633
OF THEIR BIGGEST FANS, AND I

00:45.633 --> 00:46.633
SHOULD KNOW.

00:46.633 --> 00:49.367
I'M A HUGE FAN, TOO.

00:49.367 --> 00:50.767
THIS IS A SHOT OF THEM COMING

00:50.767 --> 00:52.300
IN, GETTING OFF THE BUS.

00:52.300 --> 00:54.167
THE CROWDS HERE ARE CRAZY.

00:54.167 --> 00:55.633
THEY REALLY ARE.

00:55.767 --> 00:57.767
AND FOR ALL OF YOU FANS, HERE

00:57.767 --> 01:00.067
AND AT HOME, THEY'RE ATTEMPTING

01:00.067 --> 01:01.900
THE BIGGEST DARE THEY'VE EVER

01:01.900 --> 01:03.233
DONE.

01:03.233 --> 01:06.233
FIVE STORIES ABOVE MY HEAD IS A

01:06.233 --> 01:09.133
HIGH WIRE THAT ALL FOUR JOKERS

01:09.133 --> 01:11.067
WILL WALK FOR THE FIRST-EVER

01:11.067 --> 01:12.667
LIVE PUNISHMENT.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.900
SO LET'S BRING OUT THE MEN WHO

01:14.900 --> 01:17.567
WILL TRY TO CONQUER THAT WIRE.

01:17.567 --> 01:23.200
GIVE IT UP FOR JOE, SAL, Q, AND

01:23.200 --> 01:24.367
MURR!

01:27.833 --> 01:31.167
WOW! WOW!

01:31.167 --> 01:34.500
OH, MY GOD.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.433
THE WORD -- THE WORD

01:36.433 --> 01:38.667
"PUNISHMENT" HAS NEVER MEANT

01:38.667 --> 01:39.800
MORE BEFORE.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.367
CAN YOU EXPLAIN IT TO ME?

01:41.367 --> 01:42.167
WHY?

01:42.167 --> 01:43.400
YOU GUYS ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND.

01:43.400 --> 01:44.733
>> 'CAUSE WE'RE OUT OF OUR MIND.

01:44.733 --> 01:45.833
THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING IT.

01:45.833 --> 01:47.067
AND WE LOVE YOU GUYS!

01:50.800 --> 01:52.233
>> THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, FOR OUR

01:52.233 --> 01:53.233
100th EPISODE.

01:53.233 --> 01:54.633
YOU GUYS MAKE THIS POSSIBLE.

01:54.633 --> 01:55.767
AND IF SKY DIVING IS ANY

01:55.767 --> 01:58.333
INDICATION, I'M GONNA FAIL.

01:58.333 --> 01:59.400
>>

02:01.167 --> 02:03.667
>> I'M TRYING NOT TO THROW UP.

02:05.267 --> 02:06.333
>> I THANK YOU PERSONALLY FOR

02:06.333 --> 02:06.833
THAT.

02:06.833 --> 02:07.833
AND, Q?

02:07.833 --> 02:09.733
>> I CAN'T WAIT FOR SAL TO THROW

02:09.733 --> 02:10.567
UP!

02:10.567 --> 02:11.567
>> OH, MY GOD!

02:13.100 --> 02:15.133
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE READY FOR

02:15.133 --> 02:15.733
THIS?

02:15.733 --> 02:17.100
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

02:17.100 --> 02:18.933
IT DOESN'T MATTER, BECAUSE YOU

02:18.933 --> 02:21.200
HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CHOICE.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.533
CROWD, ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

02:25.467 --> 02:26.600
OKAY!

02:26.600 --> 02:29.900
LET'S GET THIS STARTED!

02:33.067 --> 02:34.300
>> PREPARE FOR SOMETHING

02:34.300 --> 02:35.600
AMAZING.

02:35.600 --> 02:36.800
>> HEY, MUSTACHE, WHAT'S UP?

02:38.533 --> 02:40.267
>> I WANT MY MOMMY!

02:41.900 --> 02:44.733
>> I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU!

02:44.733 --> 02:46.267
>> LARRY!

02:53.600 --> 02:54.800
>> OKAY.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.267
WHO WILL MASTER THAT WIRE, AND

02:57.267 --> 02:59.433
WHO WILL FAIL IN SHAME AND

02:59.433 --> 03:01.600
MISERY ON LIVE TV?

03:01.600 --> 03:03.367
FOR THE PAST THREE WEEKS,

03:03.367 --> 03:05.233
AMERICA HAS BEEN VOTING FOR

03:05.233 --> 03:07.333
WHICH JOKER THEY THINK WILL WALK

03:07.333 --> 03:08.333
THE FARTHEST.

03:08.333 --> 03:09.300
OKAY?

03:09.433 --> 03:11.167
YOU CAN SEE THE GRAPHICS, AND

03:11.167 --> 03:12.867
THERE IS STILL TIME TO TWEET

03:12.867 --> 03:14.800
YOUR VOTE NOW USING THE HASHTAGS

03:14.800 --> 03:16.467
AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SCREEN.

03:16.467 --> 03:17.967
BUT TONIGHT ISN'T JUST ABOUT

03:17.967 --> 03:18.933
BRAGGING RIGHTS.

03:18.933 --> 03:21.300
EACH JOKER IS COMPETING FOR THE

03:21.300 --> 03:22.900
CHARITY OF HIS CHOICE.

03:23.067 --> 03:24.267
IF THEY'RE BRAVE ENOUGH TO

03:24.267 --> 03:26.067
ATTEMPT THE WALK, THEY'LL EARN

03:26.067 --> 03:29.300
THEIR CHARITY $10,000.

03:29.300 --> 03:30.533
AND THE ONE WHO WALKS THE

03:30.533 --> 03:32.633
FARTHEST WILL WIN HIS CHARITY

03:32.633 --> 03:35.133
$50,000!

03:36.933 --> 03:38.967
AND THAT'S MADE POSSIBLE IN PART

03:38.967 --> 03:40.133
BY FanDuel.

03:40.133 --> 03:41.900
NOW, JUST BECAUSE THIS IS FOR

03:41.900 --> 03:43.767
CHARITY DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GONNA

03:43.767 --> 03:44.633
BE EASY.

03:44.633 --> 03:48.300
A FIVE-STORY HIGH WIRE IS SCARY.

03:48.300 --> 03:49.433
THAT WORD DOESN'T EVEN DESCRIBE

03:49.433 --> 03:50.100
IT.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.133
BUT THIS IS

03:51.133 --> 03:52.767
"IMPRACTICAL JOKERS," SO WE

03:52.767 --> 03:54.933
THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE

03:54.933 --> 03:56.833
MORE RIDICULOUS.

03:56.833 --> 03:57.533
OKAY?

03:57.533 --> 03:59.700
THESE GUYS LOVE COSTUMES, SO THE

03:59.700 --> 04:01.867
LOSER OF TONIGHT'S EPISODE WILL

04:01.867 --> 04:03.767
HAVE TO WALK THAT WIRE IN A

04:03.767 --> 04:05.633
COSTUME PICKED BY THE OTHER

04:05.633 --> 04:07.667
THREE FROM THE DOZENS OF CRAZY

04:07.667 --> 04:09.433
OUTFITS THEY'VE WORN OVER

04:09.433 --> 04:11.433
100 EPISODES.

04:11.433 --> 04:13.333
WE'RE ABOUT TO ROLL OUT THREE

04:13.333 --> 04:15.233
BRAND-NEW CHALLENGES, AND THE

04:15.233 --> 04:17.200
JOKER WHO GETS THE MOST THUMBS

04:17.200 --> 04:19.500
DOWN IN THEM WILL BE SUITING UP

04:19.500 --> 04:20.967
IN SOMETHING AWFUL.

04:20.967 --> 04:22.933
LIKE THAT'S NOT AWFUL ENOUGH.

04:22.933 --> 04:24.067
DOES IT SOUND GOOD?

04:24.067 --> 04:24.600
>> NO.

04:24.600 --> 04:25.900
>> DOES IT SOUND GOOD?

04:28.067 --> 04:30.933
BRING IT ON!

04:30.933 --> 04:32.100
>> HERE WE GO AGAIN.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.800
TODAY, WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE EACH

04:33.800 --> 04:35.500
OTHER LAUGH BY DOING PERSONALITY

04:35.500 --> 04:36.733
TESTS WITH STRANGERS.

04:36.733 --> 04:37.767
>> WHILE CONDUCTING THE SURVEY,

04:37.767 --> 04:38.700
THE OTHER GUYS ARE GONNA BE

04:38.700 --> 04:39.667
BEHIND THAT GLASS WALL, WHICH

04:39.667 --> 04:40.700
BECOMES SEE-THROUGH AT THE FLIP

04:40.700 --> 04:42.167
OF A SWITCH.

04:42.300 --> 04:43.300
>> THE GOAL IS TO NOT LAUGH

04:43.300 --> 04:44.367
WHILE WATCHING THE CRAZINESS

04:44.367 --> 04:45.367
THAT'S GOING ON BEHIND THE

04:45.367 --> 04:48.500
GLASS.

04:48.500 --> 04:53.200
>> IT'S REAL CRAZY.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.700
>> HEY, HOW'S IT GOING, BUD?

04:54.700 --> 04:56.067
LAMELL, GOOD TO SEE YOU, PAL.

04:56.067 --> 04:57.800
>> ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING G FIRST.

04:57.800 --> 04:58.800
>> YEAH, GO GET THEM.

04:58.800 --> 04:59.367
>> OKAY.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.867
>> COULD YOU TELL ME A MEMORY

05:00.867 --> 05:02.133
THAT YOU HAVE WITH A PET?

05:02.133 --> 05:03.433
>> I HAD A DOG NAMED PEP.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.067
>> DID YOU HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES

05:05.067 --> 05:06.467
LIKE CHANGE THE LITTER BOX?

05:06.467 --> 05:08.067
>> ALWAYS CHANGE THE LITTER BOX,

05:08.067 --> 05:10.633
WALK THE DOG, CLEAN UP AFTER

05:10.633 --> 05:13.233
THEM, AS FAR AS THEIR LIVING

05:13.233 --> 05:13.633
QUARTERS.

05:13.633 --> 05:15.833
>> AND DID YOU EVER GO TO A PET

05:15.833 --> 05:17.067
PARK WITH THEM?

05:17.067 --> 05:17.867
>> NO.

05:17.867 --> 05:18.667
>> NO?

05:18.667 --> 05:19.467
>> NO.

05:19.467 --> 05:20.567
>> OKAY.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.567
>> YOU NEVER GOT TO?

05:25.433 --> 05:28.967
>> WE GOT HIM!

05:28.967 --> 05:29.700
>> I LIKE KITTENS.

05:29.700 --> 05:30.667
>> DO YOU AGREE THAT SOME

05:30.667 --> 05:31.733
THINGS, WHEN THEY'RE LITTLE,

05:31.733 --> 05:32.867
THEY'RE CUTE, AND THEN WHEN THEY

05:32.867 --> 05:33.967
GROW UP, THEY TURN REALLY UGLY?

05:33.967 --> 05:34.967
LIKE A BABY FERRET, FOR

05:34.967 --> 05:35.400
INSTANCE.

05:35.400 --> 05:35.767
>> NO.

05:35.767 --> 05:38.733
>> NO. YOU GOT THE REVERSE.

05:38.733 --> 05:39.933
>> ALL RIGHT, I'M OUT.

05:39.933 --> 05:41.333
>> TAKE ME THROUGH A SHOPPING

05:41.333 --> 05:42.867
EXPERIENCE FOR YOU FOR CLOTHING.

05:42.867 --> 05:44.433
>> I LOOK FOR THINGS THAT I

05:44.433 --> 05:46.967
PROBABLY SAY THAT I LIKE BUT NOT

05:46.967 --> 05:49.833
NECESSARILY VERY PRICEY.

05:49.833 --> 05:51.500
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN PAYING

05:51.500 --> 05:52.933
MORE THEN I NEED TO FOR

05:52.933 --> 05:54.667
SOMETHING THAT NOBODY'S GONNA

05:54.667 --> 05:56.333
KNOW IT'S A GUCCI SHIRT OR A

05:56.333 --> 05:57.800
VAN HEUSEN SHIRT.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.833
IF YOU'RE SPENDING MORE THAN 50

05:58.833 --> 05:59.567
BUCKS FOR THIS SHIRT...

05:59.567 --> 06:00.667
>> IF YOU SPEND THAT MUCH,

06:00.667 --> 06:01.300
YOU'RE A TURKEY.

06:02.067 --> 06:03.167
>> THAT'S A LAUGH.

06:03.167 --> 06:04.200
THAT'S A LAUGH.

06:06.733 --> 06:07.867
>> BUT LIKE I SAID, I'M NOT

06:07.867 --> 06:08.700
GOING TO...

06:08.700 --> 06:10.633
>>

06:10.633 --> 06:11.767
>> YOU WANT TO TALK ME THROUGH

06:11.767 --> 06:12.833
GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE?

06:12.833 --> 06:14.167
>> LOOKING FOR WHATEVER SALES

06:14.167 --> 06:14.767
ARE THERE.

06:14.767 --> 06:16.167
THAT'S THE FIRST THING I ALWAYS

06:16.167 --> 06:18.633
LOOK FOR ANYTIME I GO SOMEWHERE.

06:18.633 --> 06:19.967
>> OH, WHAT'S THIS?

06:23.067 --> 06:24.133
>> TURN OVER.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.333
IT'S EVERY TWO OR THREE DAYS I

06:25.333 --> 06:28.167
GO AND CONSTANTLY...

06:38.133 --> 06:39.167
>> THAT'S A LAUGH.

06:39.167 --> 06:40.067
THAT'S A LAUGH.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.167
>>

06:42.167 --> 06:43.233
OH, MAN.

06:46.467 --> 06:47.567
>> HEY, HOW YOU DOING, SIR?

06:47.567 --> 06:48.133
HOW ARE YOU?

06:48.133 --> 06:49.867
THANKS FOR COMING IN TODAY.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.167
>> I'LL BE BACK.

06:51.167 --> 06:54.267
>> DO YOU LIKE PLAYING SPORTS?

06:54.267 --> 06:55.400
>> I WAS LIKE 6'1", 190 IN

06:55.400 --> 06:56.100
HIGH SCHOOL.

06:58.767 --> 07:00.500
>> IT'S HIGH-POWERED ASIAN

07:00.500 --> 07:02.367
BUSINESSMEN CLOSING DEALS OVER

07:02.367 --> 07:03.433
JOE'S BODY.

07:03.433 --> 07:06.067
>> ...RAISED BEING BORED IN

07:06.067 --> 07:09.533
SCHOOL AND NOT...

07:09.533 --> 07:10.867
>> THAT'S A LAUGH.

07:10.867 --> 07:13.367
THAT WAS A LAUGH, BUD.

07:13.367 --> 07:14.567
>> HOW DO YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC

07:14.567 --> 07:15.300
NOW?

07:15.300 --> 07:16.633
>> WELL, NOW JUST STRICTLY

07:16.633 --> 07:17.567
THROUGH MY PHONE.

07:17.567 --> 07:18.833
ABOUT MAYBE 10,000 SONGS.

07:18.833 --> 07:21.067
>> OH, WOW. OKAY.

07:21.067 --> 07:22.800
>> HERE WE GO, BABY.

07:22.800 --> 07:23.900
SOMEBODY'S ABOUT TO MAKE A

07:23.900 --> 07:26.300
BIG-TIME RETURN.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.633
OH, IT'S A ROBBER.

07:28.633 --> 07:29.633
>> WAIT!

07:31.500 --> 07:33.133
>> IT'S THE RETURN OF FAT CROW.

07:33.133 --> 07:34.667
SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW HIM FROM

07:34.667 --> 07:36.433
Q's FASHION-SHOW PUNISHMENT.

07:36.433 --> 07:37.733
>> I'M A HUGE HIP-HOP FANATIC,

07:37.733 --> 07:38.367
BUT...

07:38.367 --> 07:39.433
>> FAT CROW!

07:39.433 --> 07:41.167
FAT CROW TO THE RESCUE!

07:41.167 --> 07:43.267
>> MY FAVORITE GROUPS WERE...

07:43.267 --> 07:44.567
>> OH, MY GOD.

07:44.567 --> 07:46.833
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.567
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

07:53.933 --> 07:55.367
FAT CROW WATCHES EVERYTHING.

07:55.367 --> 07:58.133
THAT'S WHAT I LEARNED.

07:58.133 --> 07:59.333
WOW.

07:59.333 --> 08:00.500
>> ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO, HERE

08:00.500 --> 08:02.200
WE GO, HERE WE GO.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.433
>> SO, DO YOU GO TO A LOT OF

08:03.433 --> 08:04.500
SPORTING EVENTS OR NO?

08:04.500 --> 08:05.100
>> NO.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.933
I WOULD LIKE TO, BUT JUST NOT...

08:07.933 --> 08:09.233
I USED TO...

08:09.233 --> 08:11.067
>> OH, IT'S A HOT DOG MACHINE.

08:11.067 --> 08:15.800
>>

08:15.800 --> 08:17.533
>>

08:17.533 --> 08:19.167
>> SO LITERALLY, A DAY FRIDAY OR
