21:44.269 --> 21:46.771
She will stay here
and live with our warriors.

21:46.772 --> 21:49.040
As for you,
that is another story.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.008
Hold it right there!

21:51.009 --> 21:54.011
Just hold on one second.

21:54.012 --> 21:56.514
Now, we know the baby
is on the second floor,

21:56.515 --> 21:57.515
and we want her.

21:59.017 --> 22:00.017
You are foolish

22:00.018 --> 22:01.519
to think you can beat the ninja

22:01.520 --> 22:03.021
with conventional weapons.

22:06.525 --> 22:08.025
Well, I don't think
you understand.

22:08.026 --> 22:11.028
See, this gun is loaded,
and I can kill you.

22:11.029 --> 22:12.863
And when you do,

22:12.864 --> 22:15.333
my men will swarm on you
like the Cubans on Miami.

22:18.303 --> 22:19.804
Maggie, give him the gun.

22:22.307 --> 22:24.309
I'm sorry, Jodie.

22:26.812 --> 22:28.313
Take them to the dungeon!

22:39.691 --> 22:41.759
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Now that Jodie and Maggie</i>

22:41.760 --> 22:43.260
<i>have been locked up</i>
<i>in a dungeon forever,</i>

22:43.261 --> 22:44.762
<i>are they upset,</i>
<i>and did they remember</i>

22:44.763 --> 22:46.263
<i>to bring a change of clothes?</i>

22:46.264 --> 22:47.765
<i>Since El Puerco has told Jessica</i>

22:47.766 --> 22:49.266
<i>that he fools around</i>
<i>with other women</i>

22:49.267 --> 22:51.268
<i>to stop himself</i>
<i>from fooling around with her,</i>

22:51.269 --> 22:53.771
<i>will Jessica</i>
<i>start fooling around?</i>

22:53.772 --> 22:55.773
<i>Will they ever fool around</i>
<i>with each other?</i>

22:55.774 --> 22:59.176
<i>Now that Mary has told Chester</i>
<i>that he is Danny's real father,</i>

22:59.177 --> 23:00.678
<i>will Chester find it</i>
<i>in his heart</i>

23:00.679 --> 23:02.179
<i>to give Danny his kidney?</i>

23:02.180 --> 23:04.682
<i>These questions and many others</i>
<i>will be answered</i>

23:04.683 --> 23:07.686
<i>in the next episode of</i> Soap.
