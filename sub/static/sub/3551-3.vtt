WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.073
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.073 --> 00:05.436
SUSAN SHOWED A CERTAIN FLAIR
FOR HER NEW JOB.

00:05.436 --> 00:09.040
THERE YOU GO. YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE GETTING GOOD AT THIS.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.581
RENEE RENTED A HOUSE.

00:10.581 --> 00:13.484
WOW, THAT IS SO...
 WONDERFUL?

00:13.484 --> 00:15.116
CLOSE.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.188
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

00:17.188 --> 00:18.689
GABY LEARNED THE TRUTH

00:18.689 --> 00:21.122
ABOUT HER DAUGHTER
BEING SWITCHED AT BIRTH.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.653
BETH!

00:22.653 --> 00:25.426
PAUL YOUNG CONTINUED
TO SURPRISE EVERYONE.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.099
WELL, I SEE YOU'VE ALL MET
MY WIFE.

00:28.099 --> 00:31.762
AND TOM CAME HOME
WITH A MYSTERIOUS AFFLICTION.

00:31.762 --> 00:33.634
I'M NOT FEELING WELL.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.636
AGAIN?

00:35.636 --> 00:38.639
I'M JUST GONNA LIE ON THE COUCH
AND WATCH SOME TV.

00:43.144 --> 00:47.518
(Mary Alice)
TOM SCAVO WAS DEPRESSED,

00:47.518 --> 00:50.421
AND HIS WIFE HAD DONE
EVERYTHING SHE COULD

00:50.421 --> 00:53.454
TO CHEER HIM UP.

00:53.454 --> 00:56.787
SHE HAD MADE
HIS FAVORITE MEALS.

00:58.759 --> 01:02.163
SHE HAD TOLD
HER FUNNIEST JOKES.

01:03.834 --> 01:08.169
SHE'D EVEN WORN
HER SEXIEST LINGERIE.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.204
BUT NOTHING WORKED.

01:15.106 --> 01:19.750
FINALLY, LYNETTE INSISTED
HER HUSBAND GO TO THE DOCTOR.

01:21.112 --> 01:24.385
UNFORTUNATELY,
WHAT HE CAME HOME WITH

01:24.385 --> 01:27.588
WAS A PRESCRIPTION...
FOR TROUBLE.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.160
ANTIANXIETY MEDICATION?

01:29.160 --> 01:31.192
THIS IS WHAT HE GAVE YOU?

01:31.192 --> 01:35.226
DR. WEILER SAYS IT WILL HELP.
 HE SPENT 20 MINUTES WITH YOU.

01:35.226 --> 01:37.798
LYNETTE--
 AND LET ME GUESS.
DID HE WRITE THIS

01:37.798 --> 01:41.532
WITH A PEN THAT HAS
THE DRUG COMPANY'S NAME ON IT?
 I NEED THIS MEDICINE.

01:41.532 --> 01:44.235
THEN TAKE IT,
BUT I GOTTA TELL YA,

01:44.235 --> 01:46.477
THOSE DRUGS
SCARE THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

01:46.477 --> 01:49.840
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING. I AM
SO TIRED OF FEELING THIS WAY.

01:49.840 --> 01:52.713
BUT YOU'VE GONE THROUGH
ROUGH PATCHES BEFORE.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.685
YOU COULD COME OUT OF IT.

01:54.685 --> 01:57.218
SO WAIT AROUND TO GET BETTER?
THAT'S YOUR ANSWER?

01:57.218 --> 01:59.690
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
INSIDE MY HEAD!

01:59.690 --> 02:03.524
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY. HEY! HEY!

02:03.524 --> 02:07.158
REMEMBER WHEN SUSAN KEPT
HAVING ALL THOSE HEADACHES?

02:07.158 --> 02:09.160
WHO WAS THAT GUY
THAT SHE WENT TO?

02:09.160 --> 02:10.800
DOCTOR... DR. ROSS.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.764
HOW IS HE GONNA BE
ANY DIFFERENT?
 HE'S HOLISTIC.

02:13.764 --> 02:16.867
HE TRIES TO STAY AWAY FROM
HEAVY MEDS. SUSAN LOVED HIM.

02:16.867 --> 02:19.340
AND IF HE SAYS
I SHOULD BE ON THIS?

02:19.340 --> 02:21.342
THEN YOU HAVE
A SECOND OPINION.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.714
WHATEVER HE SAYS,
I'LL GO WITH IT.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.553
SHH. SHH. SHH.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.756
WELL...

02:35.756 --> 02:37.828
I SAW DR. ROSS.

02:37.828 --> 02:40.891
OH! I'M SO GLAD.

02:40.891 --> 02:42.563
DID YOU LIKE HIM?

02:42.563 --> 02:44.435
LOVED HIM.

02:44.435 --> 02:45.896
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

02:45.896 --> 02:47.898
HE--HE DOESN'T BELIEVE
IN PHARMACEUTICALS.

02:47.898 --> 02:51.472
HE ONLY PRESCRIBES STUFF THAT'S
TOTALLY HERBAL AND NATURAL.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.204
THAT IS FANTASTIC.

02:53.204 --> 02:55.206
SO WHAT DID HE SUGGEST?

02:57.177 --> 02:58.509
MEDICAL MARIJUANA.

03:00.911 --> 03:02.383
YES,

03:02.383 --> 03:05.816
TOM SCAVO
HAD BEEN BATTLING DEPRESSION,

03:05.816 --> 03:09.220
BUT HE WAS NOW FACING
A MUCH BIGGER BATTLE

03:09.220 --> 03:25.706
WITH HIS WIFE.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.207
HAPPINESS--

03:27.207 --> 03:30.781
IT'S SOMETHING WE ALL WANT,

03:30.781 --> 03:34.815
AND SO WE SEARCH FOR IT.

03:34.815 --> 03:40.291
LITTLE GIRLS FIND IT
IN THE TASTE OF CHOCOLATE.

03:40.291 --> 03:45.956
WELL-DRESSED MEN DISCOVER IT
AT THEIR LOCAL MALL.

03:45.956 --> 03:48.959
TEENAGE BOYS EXPERIENCE IT

03:48.959 --> 03:52.833
WHEN TALKING TO A PRETTY GIRL.

03:54.765 --> 03:57.868
AND THEN THERE ARE HOUSEWIVES,

03:57.868 --> 03:59.870
WHO SIMPLY CAN'T BE HAPPY

03:59.870 --> 04:02.943
UNTIL THEY'VE LEARNED
EVERYTHING THEY CAN

04:02.943 --> 04:07.748
ABOUT THE NEWEST NEIGHBOR
ON THE BLOCK.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.481
HELLO!

04:10.481 --> 04:13.784
HI. SO SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
THIS WILL JUST TAKE A SECOND.

04:13.784 --> 04:17.358
WE WANTED TO OFFICIALLY WELCOME
YOU TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:17.358 --> 04:19.790
OH!
 THIS IS MY FRIEND LYNETTE
AND SUSAN,

04:19.790 --> 04:21.832
AND I WAS TELLING THEM
ABOUT YOU, AND WE--

04:21.832 --> 04:24.495
JUST HAD TO MEET YOU.
 IMMEDIATELY. (chuckles)

04:24.495 --> 04:25.866
THAT'S SO SWEET.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.699
OH, YOU--YOU'RE MY LANDLADY,
RIGHT?

04:28.699 --> 04:31.902
YES, BUT I REALLY WANT YOU
TO THINK OF ME AS A FRIEND.

04:31.902 --> 04:34.375
ARE THOSE PICTURES HUNG
ON THE WALL WITH NAILS OR--

04:34.375 --> 04:36.877
UM, WE WANTED TO INVITE YOU
TO OUR WEEKLY POKER GAME.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.850
SHOOT. I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO PLAY POKER.

04:39.850 --> 04:41.852
OH, DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL TEACH YOU.

04:41.852 --> 04:43.854
DOES THAT FICUS TREE
HAVE A SAUCER UNDERNEATH?

04:43.854 --> 04:45.856
BECAUSE THOSE ARE
HARDWOOD FLOORS.

04:45.856 --> 04:47.858
AND WHILE YOU'RE LEARNING
ALL ABOUT TEXAS HOLD'EM,

04:47.858 --> 04:49.860
WE'LL LEARN ALL ABOUT YOU.

04:49.860 --> 04:52.723
AW! THAT SOUNDS FUN.

04:52.723 --> 04:54.695
(chuckles, gasps)

04:56.767 --> 05:00.501
OKAY, WELL, UH, WE SHOULD
BE GOING. WE'LL SEE YOU LATER.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.602
OKAY.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.073
BYE.
 (Beth) BYE.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.680
WHAT DID THOSE WOMEN WANT?

05:09.680 --> 05:11.982
THEY INVITED ME
TO PLAY CARDS WITH THEM.

05:11.982 --> 05:14.014
BUT THEY WERE JUST
BEING FRIENDLY.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.886
ON THIS STREET,

05:15.886 --> 05:18.889
NEVER CONFUSE BEING NOSY
WITH BEING FRIENDLY.

05:18.889 --> 05:21.522
THEY WERE DIGGING FOR DIRT.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.354
SO...

05:23.354 --> 05:25.356
DO YOU NOT WANT ME TO GO?

05:25.356 --> 05:27.728
NO, NO. YOU WILL GO.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.801
GIVE THEM ALL SORTS
OF MEANINGLESS INFORMATION.

05:30.801 --> 05:33.764
AND HOPEFULLY, THEY'LL START
TO THINK OF YOU AS A FRIEND.

05:33.764 --> 05:36.907
BUT... (sighs)
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM,

05:36.907 --> 05:40.441
WHY DO YOU WANT ME
TO BE FRIENDS WITH THEM?

05:40.441 --> 05:42.743
IN TIME, IT WILL BE USEFUL.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.682
(siren wailing in distance)

05:51.682 --> 05:55.586
WHERE'S THE PEN?
 DON'T YOU WANNA READ IT FIRST?

05:55.586 --> 05:57.728
WHY? DID A NURSE GET DRUNK

05:57.728 --> 06:00.431
AND SWAP IT
WITH A DIFFERENT DOCUMENT?

06:00.431 --> 06:02.433
BY SIGNING THIS, MR. SOLIS,
YOU ARE AGREEING

06:02.433 --> 06:04.495
NOT TO BRING ANY LEGAL ACTION
AGAINST THIS HOSPITAL.

06:04.495 --> 06:06.597
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

06:06.597 --> 06:08.839
AND IN RETURN, YOU'LL STOP
SEARCHING FOR THE OTHER FAMILY.

06:08.839 --> 06:10.541
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

06:15.746 --> 06:17.778
DONE. GABY.

06:21.111 --> 06:24.615
BABE, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

06:24.615 --> 06:26.787
WE DON'T KNOW HOW
THIS OTHER FAMILY WILL REACT,

06:26.787 --> 06:28.789
AND WE NEED TO PROTECT JUANITA.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.592
I AM SORRY, GABRIELLE.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.864
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
HOW YOU MUST FEEL.

06:36.467 --> 06:40.070
YOU CAN'T BEGIN TO IMAGINE
HOW I FEEL.

06:40.070 --> 06:43.734
THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD IS
THE WOMAN WHO HAS MY DAUGHTER.

06:45.806 --> 06:47.808
IF SIGNING CAN SPARE HER
THIS PAIN...

06:47.808 --> 06:51.411
(whispers) THEN I WILL DO IT.

06:59.089 --> 07:00.791
I LOVE IT!

07:00.791 --> 07:02.022
(chuckles)

07:02.022 --> 07:04.725
SOMEHOW I GET THE FEELING
YOU DON'T LOVE IT.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.157
OKAY, I-I DON'T LOVE IT.
IT'S JUST SO...

07:07.157 --> 07:08.529
YELLOW.

07:08.529 --> 07:11.201
TRUST ME.
THIS WILL BE GREAT.

07:11.201 --> 07:13.203
BESIDES,
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ROOM,

07:13.203 --> 07:15.736
NOBODY'S LOOKING
AT THE WALLS ANYWAY.

07:15.736 --> 07:19.670
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY KNOW
HOW TO SELL YELLOW.

07:19.670 --> 07:21.942
(doorbell rings)
 EXCUSE ME.

07:24.675 --> 07:27.678
I HEAR
YOU'RE GETTIN' DIVORCED.

07:27.678 --> 07:30.521
AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

07:31.822 --> 07:34.454
I'M GETTING DIVORCED, TOO,
SO WE BOTH NEED GUYS.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.657
I'M THINKING WE SHOULD HANG.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.459
UH, I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
LYNETTE HAS TOLD YOU ABOUT ME,

07:39.459 --> 07:41.461
BUT I'M REALLY NOT ONE
FOR... HANGING.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.764
LOOK, ONE WOMAN AT A BAR
IS JUST SAD.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.836
BUT TWO,
AND IT'S GIRLS' NIGHT OUT.

07:45.836 --> 07:47.838
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

07:47.838 --> 07:50.170
YOU UP FOR
A LITTLE STUD HUNTING?

07:50.170 --> 07:52.843
THAT'S A LOVELY OFFER,
BUT I THINK I'M GONNA PASS.

07:52.843 --> 07:54.144
OH, COME ON.

07:54.144 --> 07:56.146
WE GOTTA GET BACK
IN THE GAME,

07:56.146 --> 07:58.649
CUT LOOSE,
LET OUR HAIR DOWN.

07:58.649 --> 08:01.582
THAT HAIR DOES COME DOWN,
DOESN'T IT?

08:01.582 --> 08:05.255
REALLY, RENEE, THAT IS JUST NOT
HOW I LIKE TO MEET MEN.

08:05.255 --> 08:08.118
WELL, HOW ELSE YOU GONNA MEET
'EM, SITTIN' AROUND YOUR HOUSE?

08:11.822 --> 08:14.094
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.797
YOU'VE MET SOMEONE ALREADY?

08:16.797 --> 08:18.629
MAYBE.

08:18.629 --> 08:20.801
WOW.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.102
A BEAUTIFUL, CLASSY WOMAN

08:22.102 --> 08:24.805
WHO CAN GET A MAN
WITHOUT LEAVING THE HOUSE.

08:26.577 --> 08:29.740
I DON'T SEE US
BEING FRIENDS.

08:29.740 --> 08:31.842
(door closes)

08:31.842 --> 08:33.683
(vacuum whirring)

08:33.683 --> 08:35.686
(breathy voice) I DON'T KNOW

08:35.686 --> 08:38.118
HOW EVERYTHING
 GETS SO DIRTY IN HERE.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.650
UH-OH!

08:40.650 --> 08:43.754
(gasps)
IS THAT A PIECE OF LINT?

08:43.754 --> 08:45.055
(whirring)

08:45.055 --> 08:47.297
(gasps) OH, NO!

08:47.297 --> 08:48.929
IT GOT MY APRON!

08:50.761 --> 08:54.805
I'D BETTER SIGN OFF
BEFORE I'M COMPLETELY NAKED.

08:54.805 --> 08:58.909
(gasps) SEE YOU TOMORROW,
BOYS.

08:58.909 --> 09:00.140
(click key)

09:00.140 --> 09:01.842
(knock on door)
 (sighs)

09:01.842 --> 09:03.143
(normal voice) I'M BUSY!

09:03.143 --> 09:05.145
(singsongy)
HONEY, IT'S MAXINE!

09:05.145 --> 09:06.847
OH!

09:09.019 --> 09:11.221
(normal voice)
A STAR IS BORN! (laughs)

09:11.221 --> 09:13.253
(squeals) DID YOU WATCH?

09:13.253 --> 09:15.856
OH, NOT ONLY DID I WATCH,
I KVELLED.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.558
OH! I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I AM SORT OF GETTING INTO IT.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.632
THAT WHOLE THING WITH THE VACUUM
JUST CAME TO ME.

09:21.632 --> 09:24.334
WELL, THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENS
WITH THE GREAT ONES. OOPS.

09:24.334 --> 09:26.336
HERE'S A BONUS FOR YOU.

09:26.336 --> 09:28.268
WHOA!

09:28.268 --> 09:29.900
WHAT'S THIS FOR?

09:29.900 --> 09:31.902
WELL,
IT'S A LITTLE SOMETHING I DO

09:31.902 --> 09:34.605
FOR THE GIRL WHO GETS
THE MOST HITS IN A MONTH.

09:34.605 --> 09:36.607
YOU JUST UNSEATED
STACY STRAUSS,

09:36.607 --> 09:39.209
AND WITH THE CABOOSE ON HER,
THAT'S NOT EASY. (laughs)

09:39.209 --> 09:42.212
OH, MAXINE.
YOU'RE SO GOOD TO ME.
 OH, HONEY.

09:42.212 --> 09:43.714
MMM. YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:43.714 --> 09:46.056
MIKE AND I ARE FINALLY
STARTING TO SAVE SOME MONEY.

09:46.056 --> 09:48.989
WELL, DON'T SAVE IT ALL.
BUY YOURSELF SOMETHING NICE.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.291
YOU DESERVE IT.
OH, BY THE WAY,

09:51.291 --> 09:54.294
HAVE YOU DECIDED WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA DO FOR TOMORROW'S SHOW?

09:54.294 --> 09:57.267
I'M GONNA DAMP MOP
IN BIKINI BRIEFS.

09:57.267 --> 09:59.730
OOH! ARE YOU TRYING
TO MAKE ME CRY?

09:59.730 --> 10:02.102
(laughs) BYE, DOLL.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.604
(door closes)
 (sighs)

10:04.604 --> 10:06.907
THIS IS A GREAT SANDWICH.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.779
WHAT'S IN IT?

10:08.779 --> 10:10.240
OH, IT'S NOTHING.

10:10.240 --> 10:13.143
JUST A LITTLE PARMA HAM
CURED BY ITALIAN MONKS

10:13.143 --> 10:15.716
AND SOME CAVE-AGED GRUYèRE,

10:15.716 --> 10:17.748
AND OF COURSE
I MAKE MY OWN FIG MUSTARD.

10:17.748 --> 10:19.289
COOKING IS
A PASSION OF MINE.

10:19.289 --> 10:22.092
OF COURSE, IT'S NOT MUCH FUN
COOKING FOR ONE,

10:22.092 --> 10:25.155
SO, UM, IF YOU'RE FREE
THIS WEEKEND--

10:25.155 --> 10:28.358
BABE, YOU GOTTA TRY
THIS SANDWICH. IT ROCKS.

10:28.358 --> 10:30.661
THIS IS MY BOSS,
MRS. VAN DE KAMP.

10:30.661 --> 10:32.833
THIS IS STEPHANIE,
MY GIRLFRIEND.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.766
YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

10:35.766 --> 10:37.768
OF COURSE YOU HAVE A...

10:37.768 --> 10:40.871
A GIRLFRIEND
WHO'S YOUNG AND PRETTY.

10:40.871 --> 10:42.813
NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:42.813 --> 10:45.245
I'M SORRY, BREE.
WHAT WERE YOU ABOUT TO ASK ME?

10:45.245 --> 10:47.948
OH, IT'S, UH,
WASN'T IMPORTANT.

10:47.948 --> 10:51.281
YOU ENJOY YOUR SANDWICH.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.357
INSIDE, OVER THERE.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.261
LET THE STUD HUNT BEGIN.

11:17.948 --> 11:21.411
(sighs) COME ON. COME ON.
WE'RE GONNA GET STARTED.

11:21.411 --> 11:23.413
YOU OKAY?

11:23.413 --> 11:25.085
OH. YEAH.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.256
YEAH.

11:26.256 --> 11:27.918
LET'S PLAY CARDS.

11:27.918 --> 11:30.420
WHEN I WAS 8, DADDY LEFT MAMA,
AND WE WERE PRETTY MUCH ALONE.

11:30.420 --> 11:34.394
MOST OF MY FRIENDS
WERE EITHER STUFFED OR PLASTIC.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.967
OF COURSE, THERE WERE ALWAYS
MAMA'S BOYFRIENDS,

11:36.967 --> 11:38.969
BUT AS SOON
AS I'D LEARN THEIR NAMES,

11:38.969 --> 11:40.971
MAMA WOULD KICK THEM OUT,

11:40.971 --> 11:42.702
AND THERE'D BE A NEW TOOTHBRUSH
IN THE BATHROOM.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.135
UH, L-LET ME KNOW
IF I'M SHARING TOO MUCH.

11:45.135 --> 11:46.937
NO. NOT AT ALL.

11:46.937 --> 11:48.939
(under breath)
KEEP POURING THE CHARDONNAY.

11:48.939 --> 11:50.941
SHE'S CRACKING LIKE AN EGG.

11:50.941 --> 11:53.113
OKAY, QUARTER ANTE.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.815
(poker chips clink)

11:54.815 --> 11:56.817
SO, BETH, HOW DID YOU AND PAUL
MEET ANYWAY?

11:56.817 --> 11:58.448
OH, I DON'T WANNA BORE YOU.

11:58.448 --> 12:01.191
WE WON'T BE BORED.
MORE CHARDONNAY?

12:01.191 --> 12:02.392
MM.

12:02.392 --> 12:06.757
WELL... I SAW HIS PICTURE
IN THE PAPER DURING HIS TRIAL,

12:06.757 --> 12:09.259
AND THERE WAS JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT THOSE EYES

12:09.259 --> 12:10.761
THAT SPOKE TO ME.

12:10.761 --> 12:12.502
WHAT ABOUT THE HEADLINE?

12:12.502 --> 12:15.265
"ARRESTED FOR MURDER"--
THAT DIDN'T SPEAK TO YOU?

12:15.265 --> 12:17.367
I'LL ADMIT
THAT GAVE ME PAUSE.

12:17.367 --> 12:19.770
BUT THEN WE STARTED
CORRESPONDING,

12:19.770 --> 12:21.441
AND I DISCOVERED

12:21.441 --> 12:24.014
WHAT A WONDERFUL MAN
PAUL REALLY IS.

12:24.014 --> 12:26.516
BREE, LET'S FORGET ABOUT HITTIN'
THE CLUBS TOMORROW NIGHT.

12:26.516 --> 12:29.279
CLEARLY, ALL THE BEST GUYS
ARE ON DEATH ROW.

12:29.279 --> 12:32.752
BUT, HEY, YOU CAN'T HELP WHO
YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH, RIGHT?

12:32.752 --> 12:35.325
AND PAUL'S A REAL LADY-KILLER.
(laughs)

12:37.157 --> 12:40.460
(laughs) WE--WE ALWAYS FOGGED UP
THE PLEXIGLAS WITH THAT ONE.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.092
(laughs)

12:42.092 --> 12:44.464
WELL, IT'S GOOD
THAT YOU CAN LAUGH ABOUT IT.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.366
THE THING IS,

12:46.366 --> 12:49.439
IN MY HEART, I ALWAYS KNEW
HE WAS INNOCENT,

12:49.439 --> 12:51.301
AND I WAS RIGHT.

12:57.047 --> 12:59.279
WELL, HE IS.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.452
YEAH. SO LET'S PLAY CARDS.

13:13.523 --> 13:15.465
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:17.267 --> 13:19.269
PREPARING TO TAKE
MY MEDICINE.

13:19.269 --> 13:22.232
I'VE HEARD THAT
AN INCREASE IN APPETITE'S

13:22.232 --> 13:24.334
A POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECT,

13:24.334 --> 13:26.336
SO I'M TAKING
THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS.

13:26.336 --> 13:28.508
NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS BEING YOUR
OWN WEIGHT IN CHEESE DOODLES?

13:28.508 --> 13:31.481
I NEVER SMOKED POT BEFORE,
SO I WANNA BE PREPARED.

13:31.481 --> 13:34.014
HEADPHONES?

13:34.014 --> 13:35.345
PINK FLOYD.

13:35.345 --> 13:37.347
APPARENTLY, IT COMPLEMENTS
THE MEDICINAL PROPERTIES

13:37.347 --> 13:38.448
OF, UH...

13:38.448 --> 13:40.050
BLUEBERRY BLISS.

13:40.050 --> 13:41.852
LISTEN TO YOU.

13:41.852 --> 13:44.194
YOU ARE LOVING THIS.

13:44.194 --> 13:45.856
TOM THE COLLEGE NERD

13:45.856 --> 13:48.828
GETS TO FINALLY SMOKE POT
AND BE COOL.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.001
(chuckles) HEY,
I WAS PLENTY COOL IN COLLEGE.

13:51.001 --> 13:53.063
THE ONLY REASON
I DIDN'T SMOKE BACK THEN

13:53.063 --> 13:55.065
WAS BECAUSE I SIGNED
THE ABSTINENCE PLEDGE

13:55.065 --> 13:58.408
WITH
MY DUNGEONS & DRAGONS CLUB.

13:58.408 --> 14:01.441
SO... WHAT DO YOU SAY?

14:01.441 --> 14:04.214
CARE TO JOIN ME OUT BACK
BEHIND THE GARAGE

14:04.214 --> 14:06.246
FOR A LITTLE DOOBAGE?

14:06.246 --> 14:07.547
"DOOBAGE"?

14:07.547 --> 14:10.050
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE CALLING
YOUR MEDICINE NOW?

14:10.050 --> 14:12.552
COME ON. YOU NEED
TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.424
I-I AM.

14:14.424 --> 14:17.587
REALLY? 'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE
I'VE NEVER ASKED YOU

14:17.587 --> 14:20.961
TO JOIN ME BEHIND THE GARAGE
TO SPLIT A MIDOL.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.963
LYNETTE, YOU SAID
YOU WOULD GO WITH THIS.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.435
I KNOW, BUT HOW IS IT
GONNA LOOK TO THE KIDS?

14:25.435 --> 14:29.069
I DON'T WANT THEM
SEEING THEIR DAD STONED.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.102
OH, YOU--YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THEM SEEING ME STONED.

14:32.102 --> 14:33.573
THEY'LL NEVER KNOW.

14:35.505 --> 14:39.179
(scoffs)

14:39.179 --> 14:40.650
HEY, THE--

14:59.629 --> 15:01.331
(turns off faucet)

15:01.331 --> 15:03.603
(whispers) OKAY.

15:03.603 --> 15:07.007
SO WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO
SATURDAY NIGHT?

15:07.007 --> 15:09.439
WELL, I WAS THINKING

15:09.439 --> 15:11.441
THAT WE COULD GO
TO CHEZ NAOMI.

15:11.441 --> 15:15.445
ISN'T OUR PRICE RANGE
MORE CHEZ CHICKEN HUT?

15:15.445 --> 15:17.417
MIKE, IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.520
BESIDES, WE'VE BEEN WORKING
REALLY HARD. WE DESERVE IT.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.052
(sighs)
 (turns knob)

15:22.052 --> 15:24.054
OKAY,
BUT BRING YOUR BIG PURSE

15:24.054 --> 15:26.056
'CAUSE WE'RE TAKING
THE DINNER ROLLS HOME.

15:26.056 --> 15:27.527
(chuckles)

15:27.527 --> 15:30.400
SO...

15:30.400 --> 15:33.003
CHEZ NAOMI, HUH?

15:33.003 --> 15:34.404
EXPENSIVE PLACE.

15:34.404 --> 15:37.437
YEAH. YEAH, I GUESS IT IS.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.569
MUST BE NICE.

15:39.569 --> 15:42.142
UM, HAVE WE MET?

15:42.142 --> 15:44.414
I'M IN 1B. SUSAN DELFINO.

15:44.414 --> 15:46.516
OH, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

15:46.516 --> 15:48.378
I'M 1F.

15:48.378 --> 15:50.250
STACY STRAUSS.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.951
OH.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.953
UH, Y-YOU'RE
ONE OF MAXINE'S...

15:53.953 --> 15:55.485
YEAH.

15:55.485 --> 15:57.557
OH, WELL,
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.459
GUESS WE...

15:59.459 --> 16:01.391
KIND OF DO THE SAME THING.
(chuckles)

16:01.391 --> 16:04.534
OH, SOMETIMES WE DO
 EXACTLY THE SAME THING.

16:04.534 --> 16:06.336
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

16:06.336 --> 16:08.338
I KEEP AN EYE
ON THE COMPETITION.

16:08.338 --> 16:10.470
YOU LIFTED ONE OF MY MOVES.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.473
NO, I DIDN'T.
 YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE
YOU JUST WOKE UP ONE DAY

16:13.473 --> 16:18.008
AND DECIDED TO PUT
A FEATHER DUSTER IN YOUR MOUTH?
 YOU DO THAT?

16:18.008 --> 16:21.351
IT'S MY SIGNATURE BIT,
AND YOU STOLE IT.

16:21.351 --> 16:23.013
I SWEAR. I... (sighs)

16:23.013 --> 16:25.755
I-I DON'T WATCH
THE OTHER GIRLS PERFORM.

16:25.755 --> 16:28.418
OKAY, SO I GUESS
IT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE.

16:28.418 --> 16:30.560
WELL,
HERE'S ANOTHER COINCIDENCE--

16:30.560 --> 16:33.323
YOU'RE GETTING THE BIG
BONUS CHECK, AND I'M NOT.

16:33.323 --> 16:36.326
THAT'S NOT... REALLY
WHAT YOU'D CALL A COINCIDENCE.

16:36.326 --> 16:38.368
THAT'S REALLY MORE--
 ALL RIGHT, COLLEGE.

16:38.368 --> 16:41.531
JUST KEEP THE DUSTER
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.376
(lowers voice)
AND WATCH YOUR BACK.

16:53.443 --> 16:56.146
EVERYTHING OKAY?

16:56.146 --> 16:59.449
OH, YEAH.

16:59.449 --> 17:02.452
I AM WASTED.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.256
REALLY?

17:06.256 --> 17:10.400
I AM LUCY IN THE SKY HIGH.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.402
(laughs)

17:12.402 --> 17:14.032
(laughs) WOW.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.435
SO...

17:15.435 --> 17:18.238
THIS MUST BE
PRETTY INTENSE FOR YOU.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.569
WHOA.

17:20.569 --> 17:22.442
AND DON'T FORGET.

17:22.442 --> 17:25.575
TOMORROW WE HAVE TO
TROMBONE 3-D BANANA PATCH.

17:25.575 --> 17:26.746
REMEMBER?

17:26.746 --> 17:30.420
MAN, THIS IS, UH,
REALLY STRONG STUFF.

17:30.420 --> 17:33.183
SNOW SHOVEL.

17:34.484 --> 17:35.685
EXACTLY.

17:37.327 --> 17:42.132
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST UPSTAIRS
WATCHING PAIGE SLEEP,

17:42.132 --> 17:46.096
WITH HER LITTLE FINGERS
AND HER LITTLE TOES.

17:46.096 --> 17:48.398
I-I MUST'VE WATCHED HER
FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR.

17:48.398 --> 17:51.201
(sighs) SHE'S JUST SO PERFECT.

17:51.201 --> 17:54.674
AND I AM SO LUCKY.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.377
I COULDN'T FEEL HAPPIER
THAN I DO RIGHT NOW.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.548
OH!

17:58.548 --> 18:00.150
(kisses)
 (sighs)

18:00.150 --> 18:02.152
I MEAN JUST SO HAPPY
IT'S WORKING.

18:02.152 --> 18:03.613
YEAH.

18:05.855 --> 18:08.518
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
DOES THIS SAY

18:08.518 --> 18:10.520
"HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, MIKE.
I'LL LOVE YOU FOREVER"?

18:10.520 --> 18:13.163
NO. I THINK IT SAYS
"CREDIT CARD DECLINED."

18:13.163 --> 18:15.465
AREN'T YOU AND MIKE
ON A BUDGET?

18:15.465 --> 18:18.298
YEAH, BUT THINGS ARE STARTING
TO TURN AROUND LATELY.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.630
I'VE BEEN SELLING
A LOT OF MY JEWELRY.

18:20.630 --> 18:23.303
(whispers) GET OUT!

18:23.303 --> 18:25.535
(normal voice)
OUT THERE AND KEEP SELLING.

18:25.535 --> 18:26.706
(chuckles)

18:26.706 --> 18:29.639
(gasps) OH, HELLO, SILK!

18:29.639 --> 18:33.143
OH, HOW I'VE MISSED
YOUR SOFT TOUCH.

18:33.143 --> 18:34.344
MMM.

18:34.344 --> 18:36.346
I'M GOING TO
THE DRESSING ROOM.

18:36.346 --> 18:38.348
MM, YOU TWO HAVE FUN.

18:38.348 --> 18:40.250
MOMMY?

18:40.250 --> 18:42.392
OH. YOU'RE NOT MY MOMMY.

18:42.392 --> 18:45.325
ARE YOU LOST, SWEETIE?
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

18:45.325 --> 18:47.457
KIKI! YOU SCARED ME!
I COULDN'T FIND YOU.

18:47.457 --> 18:49.459
I HAVE A LITTLE GIRL, TOO.

18:49.459 --> 18:52.432
SOMETIMES THEY GET DISTRACTED
AND WANDER OFF.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.165
LET'S GO.

18:55.165 --> 18:57.207
WAIT!

18:57.207 --> 19:00.510
UH...

19:00.510 --> 19:02.842
HOW OLD IS SHE?
 8.

19:02.842 --> 19:05.645
MY DAUGHTER'S 8.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.447
WHEN'S YOUR BIRTHDAY?

19:07.447 --> 19:08.848
UH, WE'VE REALLY GOTTA GO.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.850
UH, OKAY, BUT, UH, WHAT HOSPITAL
WAS SHE BORN IN?

19:10.850 --> 19:13.453
WAS IT FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL?

19:26.666 --> 19:30.400
STANDING THERE IN THE MALL,
IT JUST HIT ME.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.702
I CAN'T SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE

19:32.702 --> 19:35.705
WONDERING IF EVERY LITTLE GIRL
I SEE IS MY DAUGHTER.

19:35.705 --> 19:37.277
NOT KNOWING WHERE SHE IS,

19:37.277 --> 19:40.780
IT--IT'S LIKE MY HEART
LIVING OUTSIDE OF MY BODY.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.353
I HAVE TO FIND HER.

19:45.255 --> 19:47.487
WELL, THERE'S
A PRIVATE DETECTIVE I WORK WITH.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.489
BUT SANCHEZ IS
A PRETTY COMMON NAME.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.491
IT'S NOT SURPRISING
THE HOSPITAL COULDN'T FIND 'EM.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.493
BUT I KNOW SOMETHING
THE HOSPITAL DOESN'T.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.794
WHEN I WAS IN LABOR,

19:54.794 --> 19:57.797
THE OTHER WOMAN'S MOTHER
CAME INTO MY ROOM BY MISTAKE,

19:57.797 --> 19:59.729
AND WE GOT TO TALKING.

19:59.729 --> 20:02.732
SHE LIVED IN EL PASO,
AND SHE WAS SO EXCITED TO HAVE

20:02.732 --> 20:04.904
HER GRANDDAUGHTER BAPTIZED
AT SANTA MARIA'S CHURCH.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.607
THAT'S GONNA HELP.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.810
SO YOU THINK
YOU CAN FIND HER?

20:10.810 --> 20:12.582
WE'LL DO OUR BEST.

20:12.582 --> 20:14.584
CARLOS IS ON BOARD
WITH THIS, RIGHT?

20:16.386 --> 20:17.687
ABSOLUTELY.

20:27.997 --> 20:30.800
OKAY, THEN GIVE ME
TEN PORTERHOUSE.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.302
(knock on door)

20:32.302 --> 20:35.505
HEY. I JUST CAME BY TO PICK UP
MY ENVELOPE FOR THE WEEK.

20:35.505 --> 20:37.006
(lowered voice)
OKAY. INSIDE.

20:37.006 --> 20:39.469
AND DON'T LISTEN
TO THIS CONVERSATION.

20:39.469 --> 20:41.371
IT'S ABOUT
YOUR CHRISTMAS GIFT.

20:41.371 --> 20:44.474
I'M BUYING ALL MY GIRLS STEAKS.
YOU GOT A PREFERENCE?

20:44.474 --> 20:47.647
WHATEVER MEAT YOU PUT
IN MY STOCKING WILL BE FINE.

20:47.647 --> 20:50.380
OOH, THAT SOUNDS DIRTY.
USE THAT.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.422
(both chuckle)

20:52.422 --> 20:53.723
I'M BACK.

20:53.723 --> 20:55.725
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOT
FOR ME?

20:55.725 --> 20:58.558
RIB EYE? I LIKE IT.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.630
(chuckles)

21:02.261 --> 21:03.363
(button clicks)

21:03.363 --> 21:05.665
(vacuum whirring)
 OHH!

21:05.665 --> 21:07.667
IS THAT A PIECE OF LINT?

21:07.667 --> 21:10.340
OOH! AHH.

21:10.340 --> 21:11.841
THAT'S MY BIT.

21:11.841 --> 21:13.303
MAX--MAXINE!

21:13.303 --> 21:16.306
WHAT?!
I'M ON WITH THE MEAT GUY.

21:16.306 --> 21:20.380
YEAH, BUT STACY STRAUSS
IS STEALING MY VACUUM BIT!

21:20.380 --> 21:23.453
OH, MY GOD.
WELL, IF SHE'S GONNA DO THAT,

21:23.453 --> 21:26.456
AT LEAST TEACH HER
HOW TO USE THE NOZZLE.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.491
AHH.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.863
(sighs)

21:47.036 --> 21:49.539
HEY THERE.
I'M READY TO PARTY.

21:49.539 --> 21:51.541
ARE YOU?
'CAUSE YOU LOOK LIKE

21:51.541 --> 21:53.983
YOU'RE READY TO TOUR
THE REAGAN LIBRARY.

21:53.983 --> 21:55.985
THIS IS A COCKTAIL CARDIGAN.

21:55.985 --> 21:58.488
LOOK CLOSELY.
THE BUTTONS ARE SHINY.

21:58.488 --> 22:01.391
WHERE'S YOUR CLOSET?

22:01.391 --> 22:04.454
I HAVE NEVER SEEN
SO MANY SWEATER SETS.

22:04.454 --> 22:07.757
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS A CLOSET
AND NOT A PORTAL TO THE 1950s?

22:07.757 --> 22:09.899
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH MY CLOTHING.

22:09.899 --> 22:12.532
BREE, YOU'RE GOING TO
A HOT YOUNG CLUB

22:12.532 --> 22:15.905

34:07.076 --> 34:08.746
(chuckles)

34:08.746 --> 34:11.250
(chuckles) SERIOUSLY,
WHY'D YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

34:11.250 --> 34:13.252
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
A LITTLE TREAT.

34:13.252 --> 34:17.626
OH. I THINK WE SHOULD
SAVE THAT MONEY

34:17.626 --> 34:20.458
AND STAY FOCUSED ON WHAT
WE'RE TRYING TO DO.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.761
AND WE CAN HAVE
A FANCY DINNER AND CELEBRATE

34:22.761 --> 34:26.135
WHEN WE MOVE BACK HOME.

34:36.775 --> 34:40.379
I HAD A LOVELY TIME
AT THE POKER GAME THE OTHER DAY.

34:40.379 --> 34:44.483
REALLY? WHAT'S THE NEIGHBORHOOD
SAYING ABOUT ME?

34:44.483 --> 34:47.216
WELL...

34:47.216 --> 34:48.657
FOR STARTERS,

34:48.657 --> 34:51.120
A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK
YOU KILLED...

34:51.120 --> 34:54.793
WHAT'S HER NAME?
MARTHA SOMETHING.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.864
HUBER.

34:56.864 --> 34:59.868
I GUESS FELICIA TILLMAN
SPREAD HER POISON PRETTY WIDE.

34:59.868 --> 35:01.830
I GUESS SHE DID.

35:01.830 --> 35:04.773
I'M NOT A MURDERER,
YOU KNOW.

35:04.773 --> 35:06.275
I KNOW.

35:08.477 --> 35:11.480
BUT I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU
BEFORE I KNEW THAT,

35:11.480 --> 35:14.513
SO EVEN IF YOU WERE...

35:14.513 --> 35:18.687
I'M ALWAYS GONNA BE
ON YOUR SIDE.

35:18.687 --> 35:20.689
REMEMBER THAT.

35:27.296 --> 35:28.797
HEY.

35:28.797 --> 35:31.800
(sighs) HEY.

35:31.800 --> 35:34.903
EVERYTHING OKAY?
YOU--YOU LOOK A LITTLE...

35:34.903 --> 35:37.206
IT'S BEEN
AN INTENSE COUPLE WEEKS.

35:37.206 --> 35:38.837
I'M SORRY, BUDDY.

35:42.841 --> 35:45.614
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU

35:45.614 --> 35:47.916
I COULD EASE
SOME OF THAT STRESS?

35:49.278 --> 35:52.281
YOU'RE NOT GONNA OFFER ME
A BACK RUB, ARE YOU?

35:52.281 --> 35:54.223
NOPE.

35:57.626 --> 35:59.628
(deep voice) A MIND RUB.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.693
SO YOU GOT THIS
FROM A DOCTOR?

36:04.693 --> 36:07.666
REALLY COOL DOCTOR.

36:07.666 --> 36:12.170
NOW I GOTTA WARN YOU,
THIS STUFF IS CHRONIC.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.643
I GOT TOTALLY BAKED
OFF OF IT THIS MORNING.

36:14.643 --> 36:17.506
I DID NOT HAVE YOU PEGGED
AS A STONER.

36:17.506 --> 36:18.807
DUDE...
 (paper crinkling)

36:18.807 --> 36:21.750
THERE'S A LOT THAT
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME.

36:21.750 --> 36:23.352
(spits) TOM?

36:23.352 --> 36:24.813
YEAH.

36:24.813 --> 36:27.185
I HATE TO BREAK THIS
TO YOU, BUT...

36:27.185 --> 36:28.687
THIS ISN'T POT.

36:28.687 --> 36:32.190
(chuckles) TELL ME THAT
IN FIVE MINUTES

36:32.190 --> 36:35.394
WHEN WE ARE SOARING
PAST THE RINGS OF SATURN.

36:35.394 --> 36:38.827
TRUST ME, CHEECH.
THIS IS OREGANO.

36:38.827 --> 36:41.870
NO WAY. I BO--I BO--I BOUGHT IT
AT A LEGIT DISPENSARY.

36:41.870 --> 36:44.573
THEN SOMEBODY MUST HAVE
SWITCHED IT ON YOU,

36:44.573 --> 36:48.807
'CAUSE THE ONLY THING GETTING
BAKED WITH THAT HERB IS LASAGNA.
 WHO WOULD DO THAT?

36:51.610 --> 36:53.612
YOU!
 (gasps) OH, JEEZ.
YOU SCARED ME.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.784
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

36:57.486 --> 36:58.947
WHATEVER DO YOU MEAN?

37:00.689 --> 37:03.852
OH, YEAH. THAT WAS ME.

37:03.852 --> 37:07.426
TH-THIS ISN'T FUNNY,
LYNETTE!

37:07.426 --> 37:09.658
TOM, YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE GETTING STONED

37:09.658 --> 37:12.361
ON A PIZZA TOPPING.
IT'S A LITTLE FUNNY.

37:12.361 --> 37:15.364
MY SENSE OF BETRAYAL
IS HUGE AT THIS MOMENT.

37:15.364 --> 37:18.006
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU SNORT
SOME BAKING POWDER?

37:18.006 --> 37:20.709
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER.
 I'M GLAD YOU'RE ENJOYING THIS.

37:20.709 --> 37:23.272
GLAD YOU ENJOY MAKING
A FOOL OF ME.

37:23.272 --> 37:26.745
THAT WAS NOT MY INTENTION.

37:26.745 --> 37:31.650
I ONLY THREW OUT THE POT BECAUSE
I DIDN'T THINK YOU NEEDED IT,

37:31.650 --> 37:35.253
AND YOU KNOW, I WAS RIGHT.
YOU GOT HAPPY ALL ON YOUR OWN.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.255
DON'T TRY TO JUSTIFY
WHAT YOU DID

37:37.255 --> 37:40.729
BY MAKING IT SEEM LIKE
SOME SORT OF "MASTER PLAN."

37:40.729 --> 37:42.561
IT WASN'T A MASTER PLAN.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.533
I LUCKED OUT
BECAUSE FOR SOME REASON,

37:44.533 --> 37:46.535
WHILE YOU WERE...
HIGH ON OREGANO,

37:46.535 --> 37:49.598
YOU MADE A DECISION
TO LIVE IN THE MOMENT.

37:49.598 --> 37:51.600
YOU STOOD
OVER OUR DAUGHTER'S CRIB

37:51.600 --> 37:54.643
AND YOU LET GO
OF THE STRESS AND THE FEAR,

37:54.643 --> 37:57.446
AND YOU FOCUSED ON THE GOOD
IN YOUR LIFE.

38:02.781 --> 38:05.954
BUT I AM SORRY
I TRICKED YOU.

38:05.954 --> 38:10.058
YOU'RE EVIL.
I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT.

38:14.062 --> 38:15.764
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

38:15.764 --> 38:17.966
TO LOOK AT
OUR BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER.

38:20.329 --> 38:23.632
THEN I GOTTA TURN THAT BONG
I MADE BACK INTO A LAMP.

38:35.644 --> 38:37.916
(cell phone rings)

38:37.916 --> 38:38.917
(beep)

38:38.917 --> 38:40.489
ANYTHING?

38:40.489 --> 38:42.020
WE FOUND THEM.

38:42.020 --> 38:43.852
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT'D THEY SAY?

38:43.852 --> 38:45.854
I HAVEN'T CALLED THEM YET.

38:45.854 --> 38:49.628
ARE YOU SURE
YOU STILL WANNA DO THIS?
 WHAT? YES, OF COURSE.

38:49.628 --> 38:52.631
GABY, YOU NEED TO REALIZE,
ONCE WE CALL THESE PEOPLE,

38:52.631 --> 38:54.633
AND THEY KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENED,

38:54.633 --> 38:56.765
IT'LL CHANGE YOUR FAMILY
FOREVER.

38:56.765 --> 38:59.608
(sighs)

38:59.608 --> 39:02.010
CALL THEM.

39:02.010 --> 39:03.472
(beep)

39:03.472 --> 39:05.414
(beep)

39:09.978 --> 39:11.980
JUANITA, COME IN HERE.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.624
I DIDN'T DO IT.

39:15.624 --> 39:17.355
I KNOW.

39:17.355 --> 39:21.390
I WAS PUTTING ON SOME MAKEUP.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE SOME.

39:21.390 --> 39:24.433
CAN YOU PUT
THE BIG FAKE EYELASHES ON ME?

39:24.433 --> 39:28.797
OF COURSE, AND...
BIG ROSY CHEEKS.

39:30.639 --> 39:32.441
(sighs)

39:32.441 --> 39:34.443
LOOK HOW GROWN-UP YOU ARE.

39:36.445 --> 39:39.448
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU'RE GONNA
BE GOING TO COLLEGE,

39:39.448 --> 39:41.910
HAVE BOYFRIENDS, GET MARRIED.

39:41.910 --> 39:44.613
I'M NOT GETTING MARRIED.

39:44.613 --> 39:47.616
I DON'T WANNA LEAVE YOU
AND DADDY... EVER.

39:49.618 --> 39:50.589
(clatter)

39:50.589 --> 39:51.820
(whispers) JUANITA...

39:51.820 --> 39:54.823
(normal voice) DO YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU?

39:54.823 --> 39:57.666
TO THE MOON AND BACK.

39:57.666 --> 39:59.828
THAT'S RIGHT.

40:04.633 --> 40:05.934
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

40:05.934 --> 40:08.937
I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU
TO THE MOON AND BACK.

40:14.643 --> 40:17.686
HEY, CARLOS, I NEED TO SIT DOWN
WITH YOU AND GABY.

40:17.686 --> 40:19.548
WHY?

40:19.548 --> 40:23.021
I JUST CALLED THE FAMILY.
IT GOT PRETTY INTENSE.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.624
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

40:27.626 --> 40:31.460
AND NOW IN A SELECTION
FROM DIOR'S FALL LINE,

40:31.460 --> 40:35.534
THE WORLD'S NEWEST SUPERMODEL...
(singsongy) JUANITA!

40:35.534 --> 40:38.066
(imitates
techno music playing)

40:38.066 --> 40:40.168
HOLD THE WORLD IN CONTEMPT.

40:40.168 --> 40:41.610
THAT'S IT.

40:41.610 --> 40:43.572
(whispers) NOW YOU LOOK
LIKE A MODEL.

40:43.572 --> 40:44.873
OH, HI, DADDY.

40:47.175 --> 40:49.818
HEY, CARLOS. WHAT'S WRONG?

40:49.818 --> 40:52.551
I JUST SPOKE TO BOB.

40:54.483 --> 40:56.785
SWEETIE, WHY DON'T
YOU GO TO YOUR ROOM?

40:56.785 --> 40:58.857
AND I'LL BE THERE
IN A SEC.

41:00.889 --> 41:03.732
HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE THIS?
 CARLOS--

41:03.732 --> 41:06.695
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS!
WE AGREED.

41:06.695 --> 41:09.638
NO, YOU AGREED. YOU RUSHED ME
INTO SIGNING THAT PIECE OF PAPER

41:09.638 --> 41:12.641
WITHOUT GIVING ME A CHANCE TO
THINK ABOUT WHAT I WAS DOING.

41:12.641 --> 41:14.643
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT COULD HAPPEN?

41:14.643 --> 41:17.475
SHE IS OUR FLESH AND BLOOD,
AND SHE'S OUT THERE!

41:17.475 --> 41:21.510
I NEED TO KNOW HOW SHE'S DOING.
I NEED TO KNOW SHE'S OKAY!
 AND WHAT IF THEY WANT
JUANITA BACK?!

41:21.510 --> 41:25.514
THEY CAN TAKE HER FROM US.
THEY CAN DO THAT NOW!

41:25.514 --> 41:28.857
THEY'RE NOT GONNA WANNA
GIVE UP THEIR OWN DAUGHTER.

41:28.857 --> 41:30.559
WE DON'T KNOW THAT!

41:30.559 --> 41:32.561
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THEM!

41:32.561 --> 41:35.694
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'VE STARTED HERE!

41:35.694 --> 41:37.596
(Juanita) MOMMY!

41:37.596 --> 41:39.067
COMING, SWEETIE!

41:39.067 --> 41:40.569
IF THIS ENDS BADLY,

41:40.569 --> 41:42.571
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU.

41:42.571 --> 41:44.903
I MEAN IT, GABRIELLE.

41:44.903 --> 41:46.635
WE'RE DONE.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.181
(sighs)

41:56.915 --> 41:58.647
HAPPINESS...

41:58.647 --> 42:02.551
IT'S SOMETHING
EVERYONE SEARCHES FOR.

42:04.753 --> 42:10.058
SOME ARE SURE THEY'LL FIND IT
ONCE THEY'VE MOVED BACK HOME.

42:10.058 --> 42:15.934
SOME THINK THEY'LL FIND IT
BY MAKING A NEW FRIEND.

42:15.934 --> 42:19.037
SOME HOPE TO FIND IT

42:19.037 --> 42:22.611
ONCE THEY'VE DEFEATED
THE COMPETITION.

42:22.611 --> 42:27.876
THEN THERE ARE THOSE WHO STOP
SEARCHING FOR HAPPINESS

42:27.876 --> 42:31.549
BECAUSE THEY LOOK UP ONE DAY
TO DISCOVER...

42:31.549 --> 42:34.723
IT WAS RIGHT THERE
IN FRONT OF THEM

42:34.723 --> 42:36.885
ALL THE TIME.
