a motor that we've got headers

factory manifolds that don't fit

on the motor.

snowball effect

keep going wrong.

extra horsepower.

didn't it?

was to get the most horsepower

1:23:15.220 --> 1:23:17.150
No, you don't.

1:23:17.150 --> 1:23:18.450
-Oh!
-Man.

1:23:18.460 --> 1:23:19.250
[ laughs ]

1:23:19.260 --> 1:23:20.590
good job.

1:23:20.590 --> 1:23:22.290
Are these teasers, right?

1:23:22.290 --> 1:23:23.390
-Chris?
-Yeah?

1:23:23.390 --> 1:23:25.260
Is it possible
to get some greenery?

1:23:25.260 --> 1:23:27.400
Oh, like, foliage
for the front of the frame?

1:23:27.400 --> 1:23:28.860
-Yeah.
-Grip department,

1:23:28.870 --> 1:23:30.000
grip department.

1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:33.940
[ engines revving ]

1:23:33.940 --> 1:23:35.240
that's why I'm here.

1:23:38.310 --> 1:23:39.610
Uh...

1:23:39.610 --> 1:23:41.280
That was kind of like
"terminator 2," wasn't it?

1:23:41.280 --> 1:23:42.680
Yeah, right?
[ laughter ]

1:23:42.680 --> 1:23:45.250
richard: Oh, look at that.
We got freaking real-live props.

1:23:45.250 --> 1:23:47.250
-Vietnam!
-Yes. Let's go with it.

1:23:47.250 --> 1:23:50.420
That's beautiful.
That's perfect. Here.

1:23:50.420 --> 1:23:52.860
Jason: My father has mentioned
to us that this is

1:23:52.860 --> 1:23:54.220
really special to him,
'cause, I mean,

1:23:54.230 --> 1:23:55.360
he was 8 years old,
I want to say,

1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:56.560
when he was here with his dad.

1:23:56.560 --> 1:23:57.960
And now, to be able
to bring his kids here,

1:23:57.960 --> 1:23:59.630
it's got to be
pretty special for him.

1:23:59.630 --> 1:24:01.260
Uh, it's one of
the n.D. Picture's cars,

1:24:01.270 --> 1:24:03.270
and then we have another car --
gray sedan.

1:24:03.270 --> 1:24:04.700
They're gonna be holding a line,

1:24:04.700 --> 1:24:07.370
and then the show's
coming up on 'em.

1:24:07.370 --> 1:24:09.840
-Look at that.
-Yes.

1:24:11.780 --> 1:24:16.150
-Whoa!
-That's pretty close, dude.

1:24:16.150 --> 1:24:18.380
-Rolling!
-Hey, is that chad mcqueen?

1:24:18.380 --> 1:24:20.550
