WEBVTT

00:04.346 --> 00:06.212
Somebody's in
a good mood.

00:06.247 --> 00:08.815
Yes.

00:09.684 --> 00:10.984
Because today

00:11.019 --> 00:12.986
I get the thumbs-up
from Dr. Brennan.

00:13.021 --> 00:14.153
Your dissertation proposal.

00:14.189 --> 00:15.488
Has she talked
to you already?

00:15.523 --> 00:16.923
Not yet, but the subject

00:16.958 --> 00:18.791
is historical
statistical analysis

00:18.827 --> 00:20.526
of bone deformations
and their relationship

00:20.562 --> 00:21.761
to disease prevention.

00:21.796 --> 00:23.663
Be still, my heart.
I know.

00:23.698 --> 00:25.865
She talked about it during
her last lecture at the NIH.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.280
Well, if you need me to put
in a good word or anything...

00:27.304 --> 00:28.235
What? No.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.003
I'm all grown up.
I got this.

00:30.038 --> 00:32.738
Okay, Captain Confidence.

00:32.774 --> 00:34.774
Sexy.
Mmm.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.511
Is that an e-mail from my mom?

00:38.546 --> 00:41.047
Well, she's been...

00:41.082 --> 00:42.982
e-mailing me recipes and stuff.

00:43.018 --> 00:44.350
"Stuff"?

00:44.386 --> 00:45.585
A few baby pictures,

00:45.620 --> 00:47.180
which I will put
in my blackmail folder.

00:47.188 --> 00:49.856
Fesenjan?
That's the recipe she sent?

00:49.891 --> 00:51.824
Yeah, it looks
delicious. Why?

00:51.860 --> 00:54.327
Because it's one of the hardest
Persian dishes to cook

00:54.362 --> 00:55.828
and it's also a...

00:55.864 --> 00:57.997
What?

00:58.033 --> 01:00.500
What they make
for weddings, usually.

01:00.535 --> 01:02.301
Oh...

01:02.337 --> 01:03.803
So she's hinting.

01:03.838 --> 01:05.405
In my family, a couple
who's been together

01:05.440 --> 01:06.939
as long as we have,
they'd be married by now.

01:06.975 --> 01:08.274
But I told her
we weren't like that.

01:08.309 --> 01:09.676
Yeah. Well, I guess
it didn't take.

01:09.711 --> 01:12.145
I told her we weren't
even discussing it yet.

01:12.180 --> 01:13.713
But when we do...
But if we do...

01:13.748 --> 01:15.348
"If"?

01:15.383 --> 01:17.717
When... if...

01:17.752 --> 01:19.819
It's-it's the same thing.

01:19.854 --> 01:21.421
It's...

01:21.456 --> 01:22.889
Oh.

01:24.159 --> 01:25.792
Oh...
I've gotta run.

01:25.827 --> 01:28.361
Dead body west
of Baltimore.

01:28.396 --> 01:31.264
You head in and set up
the forensic platform.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.700
I will meet you there
with the remains.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:42.711 --> 01:44.644
Oh, it's hot out!

01:44.679 --> 01:46.979
Cam said the remains
were discovered

01:47.015 --> 01:49.315
by a couple of Eco-herders.
Eco what?

01:49.350 --> 01:50.850
It's the new
hippie-dippie thing.

01:50.885 --> 01:52.351
Instead of
bulldozing a field,

01:52.387 --> 01:53.920
you just let
goats loose on it

01:53.955 --> 01:55.154
'cause they'll
eat anything.

01:55.190 --> 01:56.489
Well, except human remains.

01:56.524 --> 01:58.057
Goats are not carnivorous.

01:58.093 --> 01:59.258
Apparently, the clothes
were delicious, though.

01:59.294 --> 02:01.027
Thank you.
So, okay, any idea

02:01.062 --> 02:02.528
what happened to the victim?

02:02.564 --> 02:04.130
Uh, saw some drag marks
up by the road.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.631
Come on,
I'll show you.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.101
I imagine the goats
trampled the remains.

02:08.136 --> 02:10.203
That they did.
And quite well.

02:10.238 --> 02:12.939
Second generation
pupal stage blowflies

02:12.974 --> 02:14.774
set time of death
six to seven days ago.

02:14.809 --> 02:17.343
There is a significant
amount of predation,

02:17.378 --> 02:18.911
as well as
fracturing,

02:18.947 --> 02:21.114
not all it caused by the goats.
Well, no,

02:21.149 --> 02:22.629
but they did a number
on the clothing.

02:22.650 --> 02:24.217
I'm gonna need the goats
to come back to the lab.

02:24.252 --> 02:25.718
Excrement?
Well...

02:25.754 --> 02:27.019
we look where the evidence is.

02:27.055 --> 02:29.455
Judging by the length

02:29.491 --> 02:30.723
of the hip axis,

02:30.759 --> 02:32.358
the decedent
was female,

02:32.393 --> 02:34.160
of Mongoloid
descent.

02:34.195 --> 02:37.096
The wear on the
mandibular teeth suggests

02:37.132 --> 02:38.397
that she was in her late 20s.

02:38.433 --> 02:40.266
Well, Aubrey was right.

02:40.301 --> 02:41.934
Drag marks, they lead
right up to the road.

02:41.970 --> 02:43.870
And look at this.

02:46.274 --> 02:49.142
Well, the discoloration
indicates

02:49.177 --> 02:51.410
that an organic compound

02:51.446 --> 02:54.013
was introduced to
the existing layer of silt.

02:54.048 --> 02:56.716
I was gonna go with "pool of
blood," but... what she said.

02:56.751 --> 02:58.317
There's a lot of it.
The victim probably bled out.

02:58.353 --> 02:59.385
Hey, guys?

02:59.420 --> 03:01.888
Not now, Bug Boy!

03:01.923 --> 03:04.023
Oh, I could really
use some help.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.424
Really? Really, really?

03:06.795 --> 03:08.528
All right, what the hell
is he doing?

03:08.563 --> 03:10.563
Oh...! Hey! Come here!

03:10.598 --> 03:11.998
- What the hell is he doing?
- Some help, huh?

03:12.033 --> 03:13.466
It's got the victim's watch!

03:13.501 --> 03:14.967
No, no! No!

03:15.003 --> 03:17.069
I don't think you can get him.

03:17.105 --> 03:18.271
Hey...!

03:21.609 --> 03:22.642
Come on... okay...

03:23.845 --> 03:25.411
Well, go ahead.
Help him out.

03:25.446 --> 03:27.547
You kidding?
Yeah, go.

03:27.582 --> 03:28.848
Hodgins, I'm coming!
Come here!

03:28.883 --> 03:30.183
Hey! Aubrey!

03:30.218 --> 03:31.918
Bag any excrement you can find!

03:31.953 --> 03:33.052
Hey! Boy!

03:33.087 --> 03:34.587
Come here, boy!

03:34.622 --> 03:36.422
Ah, look at
that, huh?

03:36.457 --> 03:37.757
You're fast.

03:37.792 --> 03:39.592
Give me the watch!

03:39.627 --> 03:41.655

04:16.606 --> 04:18.873
What is that?
Uh, Dr. Brennan found

04:18.908 --> 04:20.641
Harris lines on
the long bones,

04:20.677 --> 04:23.144
suggesting the victim suffered
from malnutrition as a child.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.712
I sent Mr. Vaziri to retrieve

04:24.747 --> 04:27.014
a dual energy X-ray wand

04:27.050 --> 04:28.416
to measure the
victim's T-score.

04:28.451 --> 04:29.884
It tests for bone density,

04:29.919 --> 04:31.419
and it looks like she's
gonna fail the test.

04:31.454 --> 04:32.653
Negative 2.5.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.655
Osteoporosis in a
woman that young?

04:34.691 --> 04:37.091
Well, the fracture
pattern suggests

04:37.126 --> 04:39.560
the bones are more brittle
than normal.

04:39.595 --> 04:41.095
This is interesting.

04:41.130 --> 04:42.964
Robust brow ridges

04:42.999 --> 04:45.433
and sternocleidomastoid

04:45.468 --> 04:46.667
muscle attachment sites.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.069
She's Chinese.

04:48.104 --> 04:49.236
Yes.

04:49.272 --> 04:50.571
And she's missing
the fourth

04:50.606 --> 04:52.306
and fifth phalanges
on both feet.

04:52.342 --> 04:54.241
What?
Someone cut off her toes.

04:54.277 --> 04:55.743
It could merely
be predation

04:55.778 --> 04:57.098
or decomp.
It's too early to tell.

04:57.113 --> 04:58.312
Very good, Mr. Vaziri.

04:58.348 --> 04:59.380
You-you have to date

04:59.415 --> 05:01.182
the start of her malnutrition.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.617
Use isotope analysis...
To determine place of birth

05:03.653 --> 05:05.119
or any contributing
environmental conditions.

05:05.154 --> 05:06.320
I'm all over it.

05:06.356 --> 05:07.388
Great.

05:07.423 --> 05:08.589
Is there anything else?

05:08.624 --> 05:10.157
Not for now.
Are you sure?

05:10.193 --> 05:11.959
- Yes.
- I believe there is,

05:11.995 --> 05:14.562
Dr. Brennan.
I rarely forget.

05:14.597 --> 05:16.697
- Arastoo's dissertation?
- Sweetie,

05:16.733 --> 05:19.033
I'm sure he's sweating bullets.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.334
That's impossible to do.

05:20.370 --> 05:21.635
It's fine.

05:21.671 --> 05:22.970
Whenever you're ready.

05:23.006 --> 05:24.271
Honey, just tell him

05:24.307 --> 05:25.639
that you approve,
so that he can breathe.

05:25.675 --> 05:27.575
Well, I wouldn't want it
to affect his work.

05:27.610 --> 05:29.276
- We'll discuss it later, Mr. Vaziri.
- Well, I'm...

05:29.312 --> 05:31.379
I'm sure worrying would affect
his work more.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.948
I wouldn't want worrying
to distract you.

05:33.983 --> 05:35.316
I am not approving

05:35.351 --> 05:36.917
your dissertation
proposal.

05:36.953 --> 05:38.786
I hope that makes
you feel better.

05:48.498 --> 05:49.797
This is the watch
the goat was chewing on.

05:49.832 --> 05:51.198
Yeah. The
other jewelry

05:51.234 --> 05:52.867
came out of the goats
a little later,

05:52.902 --> 05:54.535
so it must have
all been on her.

05:54.570 --> 05:56.404
Since the squints are saying
she's poor and malnourished.

05:56.439 --> 05:57.838
I'm guessing
these aren't hers.

05:57.874 --> 05:59.907
Especially since half of
this stuff is for men.

05:59.942 --> 06:01.208
So if she was
a thief,

06:01.244 --> 06:03.010
maybe she had a partner
she betrayed?

06:03.046 --> 06:05.546
Hodgins says that she was
wearing some kind of a uniform.

06:05.581 --> 06:07.515
So the victim could have
been a housekeeper,

06:07.550 --> 06:09.250
maybe worked for a caterer?
Well, when you work

06:09.285 --> 06:10.751
for rich people, you know,
it's pretty easy

06:10.787 --> 06:12.820
to poach things here and there.
Tell you what,

06:12.855 --> 06:14.188
take the rest
of these things

06:14.223 --> 06:15.523
and see if they've
been reported stolen.

06:15.558 --> 06:18.526
Okay?
You got it.

06:18.561 --> 06:21.762
Damn. So I have
a full facial reconstruction

06:21.798 --> 06:24.031
and no match
on any available database.

06:24.067 --> 06:26.534
So we can't I.D. her.
I think we can.

06:26.569 --> 06:29.537
So, remember that watch that
the goat thought was a snack?

06:29.572 --> 06:31.972
Well, the serial number
was all scratched,

06:32.008 --> 06:33.641
and I managed to
reconstitute it.

06:33.676 --> 06:35.342
Nice.
Right? Yeah.

06:35.378 --> 06:37.778
A little medium-
strength aqua regia,

06:37.814 --> 06:39.346
some polish, and voilá.

06:39.382 --> 06:41.549
Now you just run
the serial number.

06:45.421 --> 06:49.223
Huh. So the watch belongs
to a Sandra Zins.

06:49.258 --> 06:50.324
Maybe she'll recognize
the victim.

06:50.359 --> 06:51.425
Excellent work,

06:51.461 --> 06:52.927
Dr. Hodgins.
Thank you very much.

06:52.962 --> 06:54.862
And now I got one
for you, Angie.

06:54.897 --> 06:57.998
Little prize in the excrement--
some photo paper.

06:58.034 --> 06:59.934
Oh. It's all torn up.

06:59.969 --> 07:01.402
Yeah, that'll happen
when it goes through

07:01.437 --> 07:03.537
the gastrointestinal tract.
Thought maybe

07:03.573 --> 07:05.639
- you could figure out what the photo was.
- Sure.

07:05.675 --> 07:06.807
Poop paper.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.275
Why not?

07:12.548 --> 07:15.316
This watch, it was, uh,
registered to you.

07:15.351 --> 07:16.617
Yes.

07:16.652 --> 07:17.918
Because it's mine.

07:17.954 --> 07:20.988
You know this woman?
You recognize her?

07:21.023 --> 07:23.491
Of course.
That's Theresa, my maid.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.159
What is this about?

07:25.194 --> 07:27.795
She was found dead
earlier today.

07:27.830 --> 07:29.763
Oh, my God.

07:29.799 --> 07:31.332
What happened?

07:31.367 --> 07:33.934
It appears as though
she was murdered.

07:33.970 --> 07:35.136
But she...

07:35.171 --> 07:36.971
Oh, this is horrible.

07:37.006 --> 07:40.307
How long did she work for you?
Three months.

07:40.343 --> 07:42.209
She was so sweet.

07:42.245 --> 07:44.712
And why would she have your watch?
I've no idea.

07:44.747 --> 07:46.780
I didn't even know
it was missing.

07:48.184 --> 07:50.451
She was trying to start
a new life here.

07:50.486 --> 07:53.420
I speak a little Chinese,
I thought I could...

07:53.456 --> 07:55.856
help ease the transition
for her, but...

07:55.892 --> 07:57.691
My God.

07:57.727 --> 07:58.926
You speak Chinese?

07:58.961 --> 08:01.562
I spent much
of my career in East Asia

08:01.597 --> 08:04.031
working for an international
relief agency.

08:04.066 --> 08:06.667
That's where I met
my late husband.

08:06.702 --> 08:09.136
He was American--
an importer.

08:10.506 --> 08:12.439
If I'd known she needed money,

08:12.475 --> 08:14.475
I would have
just given it to her.

08:14.510 --> 08:17.343
Do you have her contact info,
address, maybe?

08:17.368 --> 08:17.847
No.

08:17.847 --> 08:20.147
I hired her
through Sunny Helpers.

08:20.183 --> 08:22.816
A man, Victor Lee,
owns the place.

08:22.852 --> 08:26.387
He handled payment,
scheduling, everything.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.756
Does she have any family?

08:28.791 --> 08:31.091
All we know so far
is what you told us,

08:31.127 --> 08:32.559
but, tell you what,

08:32.595 --> 08:35.429
if you have anything else, just...
Of course.

08:35.464 --> 08:37.231
If she needs someone...

08:37.265 --> 08:39.533
to help with funeral
arrangements or anything,

08:39.568 --> 08:41.302
will you let me know?

08:42.205 --> 08:44.738
Sure.

08:52.215 --> 08:54.081
Oh. Dr. Saroyan,
I had no idea

08:54.116 --> 08:56.750
you needed to see me.
Yeah, how could you    just dismiss

08:56.786 --> 08:58.552
Arastoo's dissertation
proposal like that?

08:58.588 --> 09:01.355
Because I was told his work
would suffer if I didn't.

09:01.390 --> 09:03.791
Well, I looked at his proposal--
his research was excellent.

09:03.826 --> 09:04.826
I agree.

09:04.827 --> 09:06.527
His skill is
not in question.

09:06.562 --> 09:08.362
A dissertation by
someone as accomplished

09:08.397 --> 09:11.265
as Mr. Vaziri should lead
research in a new direction.

09:11.300 --> 09:13.767
And you can't work
with what he's given you?

09:13.803 --> 09:15.302
Well...
I already have

09:15.338 --> 09:16.670
my doctorate.

09:16.706 --> 09:18.772
The work is for
Mr. Vaziri to do.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.441
He was just trying
to please you

09:20.476 --> 09:22.309
by choosing a subject
he thought you'd like.

09:22.345 --> 09:24.278
Nothing could
please me less.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.213
It's my job to
nurture trailblazers,

09:26.249 --> 09:28.215
not sycophants.
He was crushed, Dr. Brennan.

09:28.251 --> 09:29.883
Do you feel
he's not capable

09:29.919 --> 09:32.886
of discussing this
with me directly?

09:32.922 --> 09:34.355
Of course not.
But it is common

09:34.390 --> 09:36.090
in hierarchical situations

09:36.125 --> 09:38.792
for the person in charge to
feel their stature threatened

09:38.828 --> 09:41.362
by an underling's poor
performance, and since...

09:41.397 --> 09:42.763
No. N... I...

09:42.798 --> 09:44.031
I just...

09:44.066 --> 09:46.133
I have to get back to work.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.902
I-I'm sorry to bother you.

09:52.408 --> 09:54.141
I have owned Sunny Helpers
for ten years.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.710
I started the company
when I moved here from China.

09:56.746 --> 09:58.879
When did Theresa start
working for you?

09:58.914 --> 10:00.247
Three months ago.

10:00.283 --> 10:02.516
She was from my village
in Yanbian.

10:02.551 --> 10:04.618
You know of it?
No.

10:04.654 --> 10:06.053
It is a place

10:06.088 --> 10:08.055
of great poverty, great despair.

10:08.090 --> 10:09.356
I try to help
give them jobs

10:09.392 --> 10:10.991
when they manage
to leave.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.661
I brought her, uh...

10:13.696 --> 10:14.928
work visa.

10:14.964 --> 10:16.697
Everything is legal.

10:16.732 --> 10:19.233
Except when the employee starts
stealing from the client.

10:19.268 --> 10:21.135
I just found out.

10:21.170 --> 10:23.003
Some clients called last week.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.405
Must have been bad for business.

10:24.440 --> 10:26.340
So maybe you,
what, confronted her?

10:26.375 --> 10:27.608
Things got out of hand?

10:27.643 --> 10:29.610
No. I was going
to confront her,

10:29.645 --> 10:31.445
as you say, of course, but...

10:31.480 --> 10:33.013
I never saw her again.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.782
Have you tried
contacting her?

10:34.817 --> 10:36.083
With little money,

10:36.118 --> 10:38.619
Min-Yung didn't have
a permanent home.

10:38.654 --> 10:42.423
She slept...
wherever she could.

10:42.458 --> 10:46.260
Unfortunately, she was not
the first person to steal.

10:46.295 --> 10:48.762
In Yanbian, sometimes it
is the only way to survive.

10:48.798 --> 10:50.264
Well,
I'm gonna need a list

10:50.299 --> 10:52.099
of all of Min-Yung's clients.
Of course.

10:52.134 --> 10:53.167
Thank you.

10:53.202 --> 10:54.902
I have a list here...

10:54.937 --> 10:57.705
and the, uh, name.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.673
A name?

10:59.709 --> 11:02.142
I don't like
to accuse a client,

11:02.178 --> 11:04.611
but, uh, there was
a client, a man.

11:04.647 --> 11:07.614
Min-Yung said that
he would make suggestions.

11:07.650 --> 11:09.383
What, he was hitting on her?

11:09.418 --> 11:11.585
She begged me not
to interfere, so I didn't.

11:11.620 --> 11:13.821
What if he was the one?

11:13.856 --> 11:16.290
And I could have stopped it.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.740
You have more evidence
for me, Mr. Vaziri?

11:24.870 --> 11:27.662
While articulating the skeleton,
I noticed enlarged facets

11:27.663 --> 11:29.596
at the distal ends
of the radius and ulna

11:29.631 --> 11:31.898
at the point of articulation
with the carpals.

11:31.934 --> 11:34.034
The victim's wrists
were dislocated.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.869
I didn't know
what to make of it

11:35.904 --> 11:37.871
until I examined the pelvis
and found straddle fractures.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.673
Taken together, it's indicative
of sexual assault.

11:39.708 --> 11:41.274
Very good.

11:41.310 --> 11:43.109
Min-Yung's boss told Booth

11:43.145 --> 11:45.479
that one of her clients was
making sexual advances on her.

11:45.514 --> 11:49.382
The abrasions suggest the
victim's wrists were tied.

11:49.418 --> 11:52.486
The dislocations were caused
by her struggle to get out.

11:52.521 --> 11:54.287
During a sexual
assault.

11:54.323 --> 11:56.423
I'll ask Dr. Hodgins to
reexamine the clothes

11:56.458 --> 11:57.624
for semen and foreign
fibers and particulates.

11:57.659 --> 11:59.059
And now that
Cam seems content

11:59.094 --> 12:01.061
with my reasoning
about your dissertation,

12:01.096 --> 12:02.496
she can reexamine the tissue.

12:02.531 --> 12:04.664
What?
The tissue.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.333
I'll tell Booth we may be
looking for a sexual predator.

12:06.368 --> 12:07.368
Dr. Brennan.

12:07.402 --> 12:09.669
Yes, Mr. Vaziri.

12:11.139 --> 12:13.640
I don't want you to think
I told Cam to talk to you.

12:13.675 --> 12:15.742
This is the first
I've heard that she had.

12:17.679 --> 12:19.646
She felt I was being unfair,

12:19.681 --> 12:22.415
I told her trying to please me
is not your assignment.

12:22.451 --> 12:26.086
I said I felt you
were more than capable

12:26.121 --> 12:28.588
of coming up with
a far more original

12:28.624 --> 12:30.857
and compelling
dissertation proposal.

12:30.893 --> 12:32.692
Was I wrong?

12:32.728 --> 12:35.295
I trust your judgment.

12:35.330 --> 12:37.898
Which is why I asked
for you to be my mentor.

12:38.767 --> 12:40.901
Excellent choice.

12:51.113 --> 12:52.846
Heard you were
looking for me.

12:52.881 --> 12:54.080
Oh, that's
really nice of you.

12:54.116 --> 12:55.215
I've already eaten,
but thanks.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.516
What? Oh, no,
this is mine.

12:56.552 --> 12:58.218
I can order you more,
if you want.

12:58.253 --> 12:59.619
That's okay.

12:59.655 --> 13:01.288
All right, w-what'd
you want me for then?

13:01.323 --> 13:04.090
Did a background check
on Min-Yung's clients.

13:04.126 --> 13:05.926
Okay, what am I looking at here?

13:05.961 --> 13:07.527
Jeremy Walford, 34.

13:07.563 --> 13:09.629
Used to be a teacher
at a local prep school.

13:09.665 --> 13:11.164
Mmm.

13:11.199 --> 13:13.633
Tuna melt from the diner
really travels well.

13:13.669 --> 13:15.769
Okay, why do I care
about this guy?

13:15.804 --> 13:17.137
Min-Yung's
getting hit on,

13:17.172 --> 13:19.172
Walford's a registered
sex offender.

13:19.207 --> 13:20.874
Got the boot
from his teaching job

13:20.909 --> 13:23.877
for improper conduct
with female students.

13:23.912 --> 13:25.545
<i>Asian</i> female students.

13:25.581 --> 13:28.348
Min-Yung was cleaning his house
the day she disappeared.

13:28.383 --> 13:30.250
Thought you'd find
that interesting.

13:30.285 --> 13:31.685
Imagine the photo op--

13:31.720 --> 13:34.154
we bring down a pedophile-
come-murderer.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.589
Seriously?

13:35.624 --> 13:36.723
What? It's good press.

13:36.758 --> 13:38.191
You can have a fry
if you want.

13:38.226 --> 13:39.559
I don't want a fry.

13:39.595 --> 13:41.394
Okay, this is not
about the press, okay?

13:41.430 --> 13:43.763
This is about bringing a woman's
killer to justice. You got it?

13:43.799 --> 13:46.032
So, just go find this Walford
guy, and bring him in.

13:46.068 --> 13:47.100
All right,
soon as I...

13:47.135 --> 13:48.135
No, no. Now.

13:48.136 --> 13:49.269
Do it now.

13:51.640 --> 13:52.640
Blood-sugar issue.

13:52.674 --> 13:53.873
Now!

13:53.909 --> 13:56.810
Come on... I want
the food, man.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.853
Hey, I'm still
into analyzing the tissue,

14:06.888 --> 14:09.589
but so far I can't find any
evidence of sexual assault...

14:09.625 --> 14:11.691
That's not why I'm here.
Oh.

14:13.028 --> 14:15.095
Why did you talk to Dr. Brennan?

14:15.130 --> 14:17.897
That was probably a mistake.

14:17.933 --> 14:19.432
"Probably"?
I did it for you.

14:19.468 --> 14:21.701
My intention was pure, Arastoo.
It was?

14:21.737 --> 14:23.303
Your intention was
to protect me, which implies

14:23.338 --> 14:24.771
that I can't
take care of myself.

14:24.806 --> 14:26.206
Which implies a lack
of faith in me.

14:26.208 --> 14:28.141
Which implies a lack of respect.

14:28.176 --> 14:29.176
No... What do you mean?

14:29.177 --> 14:30.377
I have complete faith in you.

14:30.412 --> 14:31.778
What is it, Cam?

14:31.813 --> 14:34.214
This reticence you have
every time we get close.

14:34.249 --> 14:35.582
Really close.

14:35.617 --> 14:36.783
Okay, I-I understand
that you're upset...

14:36.818 --> 14:37.818
If...

14:37.853 --> 14:38.853
we talk about marriage.

14:38.854 --> 14:39.819
That's what you said: "if."

14:39.855 --> 14:41.521
Marriage?
Yes.

14:41.556 --> 14:42.796
W-We've been seeing each other,

14:42.824 --> 14:45.291
basically living together,
for over a year.

14:45.327 --> 14:47.827
It's a topic that would be
normal to discuss,

14:47.863 --> 14:49.062
but every time you run.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.463
Arastoo, I...

14:50.499 --> 14:52.499
It's not Dr. Brennan
I can't deal with, Cam.

14:52.534 --> 14:54.668
I think it's you.

15:00.942 --> 15:04.511
You're a registered
sex offender, Jeremy.

15:04.546 --> 15:06.346
Theresa was just my maid.

15:06.381 --> 15:07.580
I've been good,

15:07.616 --> 15:08.882
ask my therapist--
court-appointed--

15:08.917 --> 15:10.350
he'll tell you.

15:10.385 --> 15:11.584
How do you explain
Theresa complaining

15:11.620 --> 15:12.620
about you to her boss?

15:12.621 --> 15:13.720
She was cute.

15:13.755 --> 15:15.121
I-I asked her out
a couple times,

15:15.157 --> 15:17.190
but it never went anywhere,
so I dropped it.

15:17.225 --> 15:19.325
Where did you go after she left
your place last Monday night?

15:19.361 --> 15:21.861
I didn't.

15:21.897 --> 15:23.530
I stayed home,

15:23.565 --> 15:25.365
watched TV.
You got no alibi

15:25.400 --> 15:27.200
and a predilection
for Asian girls.

15:27.235 --> 15:29.369
It is not looking good
for you, Jeremy.

15:29.404 --> 15:32.539
I need more here, or I'm gonna have to
lock you up tonight with a bunch of guys

15:32.574 --> 15:35.542
who really don't like molesters.
Okay!

15:35.577 --> 15:37.143
I...

15:37.179 --> 15:40.013
walked her to the bus stop once.

15:40.048 --> 15:41.748
Maybe I was a little insistent,
but when she pushed me

15:41.783 --> 15:43.883
away to get on the bus,
that was it.

15:43.919 --> 15:45.452
I swear.
Where did she live?

15:45.487 --> 15:46.786
I have no idea.

15:46.822 --> 15:48.388
She'd just get on the bus.

15:48.423 --> 15:49.823
What bus?

15:50.759 --> 15:52.859
The 22.

15:52.894 --> 15:55.595
Toward Highlandtown.

15:57.466 --> 15:59.799
Is that enough?

15:59.835 --> 16:02.402
To not get me locked up?

16:03.305 --> 16:05.538
Nope.

16:11.146 --> 16:12.946
Hey. So...

16:12.981 --> 16:14.881
finding out the bus
she took is a big help,

16:14.916 --> 16:17.283
but hopefully I can use
particulates to narrow down

16:17.319 --> 16:19.285
where she actually lived
along the route.

16:19.321 --> 16:21.221
I'm looking through the treads
on her shoes now.

16:21.256 --> 16:23.256
Would evidence of
histoplasmosis help?

16:23.291 --> 16:25.125
Cave disease? Yeah.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.127
Yeah, you bet. Because right now
what I'm getting off the treads,

16:27.162 --> 16:29.395
it's-it's giving me
a pretty big area.

16:29.431 --> 16:31.097
Well, look, there's evidence
of granulomas in her lungs.

16:31.133 --> 16:32.632
So she had to have lived

16:32.667 --> 16:35.068
someplace where she could have
inhaled bat guano.

16:35.103 --> 16:37.937
Man, excrement is our friend
on this one.

16:37.973 --> 16:40.440
Okay, if I cross-reference
bat caves...

16:40.475 --> 16:42.509
I actually just said
"bat caves."

16:42.544 --> 16:44.277
Continue, Dr. Hodgins.

16:44.312 --> 16:48.081
Right, so, if I cross-reference
caves with the particulates

16:48.116 --> 16:53.453
that I pulled off her treads
and the 22 bus route...

16:53.488 --> 16:56.089
Yep, that's a bingo.

16:56.124 --> 16:59.159
There's only one cave in the area--
it's about three miles from a bus stop.

16:59.194 --> 17:01.294
And, look, there's a few houses around.
One pretty close

17:01.329 --> 17:03.830
to where the body was found.

17:14.910 --> 17:17.676
Do you hear that?

17:21.348 --> 17:23.116
Mr. Lee.

17:23.151 --> 17:25.518
I'm guessing it's not
a coincidence to find you here.

17:25.554 --> 17:26.986
Agent Booth, I, uh...

17:27.021 --> 17:28.855
This is not a good time.
Perhaps I could

17:28.890 --> 17:30.690
visit you tomorrow. I-I'm sorry.

17:30.725 --> 17:32.492
Oh, you know, that's not
gonna work, you understand?

17:32.527 --> 17:34.661
We got a warrant, okay?
Anyone here with you?

17:34.696 --> 17:37.197
No. It's an old house.
It creaks.

17:39.201 --> 17:41.835
Guess it's got a cough, too.

17:41.870 --> 17:43.670
What's down there? Come on.

17:43.705 --> 17:46.206
Easy.

17:48.076 --> 17:50.910
You got him?
Yeah.

18:03.592 --> 18:05.158
Oh, my God.

18:08.597 --> 18:11.598
They don't just work for you,
huh? They're your slaves.

18:22.546 --> 18:25.947
I finished separating the ante-,
peri- and postmortem wounds,

18:25.982 --> 18:28.917
and I found this-- evidence
of blunt-force trauma

18:28.952 --> 18:33.021
to the anterior surfaces
of the ribs and sternum.

18:33.056 --> 18:34.889
There's remodeling
but it's slight.

18:34.925 --> 18:37.492
Perhaps a week's worth?
I'll bet whoever beat Min-Yung

18:37.527 --> 18:39.861
before her murder came back
to finish the job.

18:39.896 --> 18:42.797
It's not our job to speculate.
But she could have been fighting back.

18:42.832 --> 18:45.272
Maybe Victor Lee found out she
was gonna tell the authorities.

18:45.302 --> 18:46.782
The damage you discovered
on the bones

18:46.803 --> 18:49.704
is very helpful, Mr. Vaziri.
I'll tell Booth.

18:49.739 --> 18:53.408
I remember the first morning
I woke up as a citizen.

18:53.443 --> 18:55.610
It meant everything to me.

18:55.645 --> 18:58.346
But I never thought anything
like this could happen here.

18:58.381 --> 19:00.615
Anthropologically speaking,
in any society,

19:00.650 --> 19:03.618
one group will always occupy
a higher status

19:03.653 --> 19:07.255
and will exploit those
who are more vulnerable.

19:07.290 --> 19:10.425
15,000 people a year are brought
into this country to be slaves.

19:10.460 --> 19:13.194
Are we just supposed to accept that?
No,

19:13.229 --> 19:14.629
Mr. Vaziri, we fight it.

19:14.664 --> 19:16.631
No matter what
the anthropological reasons,

19:16.666 --> 19:19.901
we fight to make the world
a better place.

19:28.645 --> 19:31.079
Make sure we got
measurements of the rooms...

19:38.221 --> 19:39.420
Get those
three girls some water...

19:39.456 --> 19:41.389
Look, Alex,

19:41.424 --> 19:42.857
this is a homicide
investigation, okay?

19:42.892 --> 19:44.225
If the State Department
wants to play along,

19:44.260 --> 19:45.793
that is fine,
but not a word...

19:45.829 --> 19:47.895
Come on, Booth, this is
a human trafficking case.

19:47.931 --> 19:50.865
If I don't make myself known,
my department looks

19:50.900 --> 19:52.834
like it doesn't care. And I do.
Fine.

19:52.869 --> 19:54.502
You stay in your lane,
we'll stay in our lane.

19:54.537 --> 19:56.371
That's fine,
but let's do this fast.

19:56.406 --> 19:58.206
I got to move all these women
to a holding facility

19:58.241 --> 19:59.574
so we can figure out
their legal status.

19:59.609 --> 20:01.342
No, no, no.
You can't lock them up.

20:01.378 --> 20:02.844
They've been locked up
ever since they got here.

20:02.879 --> 20:04.445
They'll be cared for.

20:04.481 --> 20:06.080
But they obtained their visas
under false pretenses.

20:06.116 --> 20:07.382
That's not
their fault.

20:07.417 --> 20:09.050
They were lied to. My God.

20:09.085 --> 20:11.019
- Look at them. They're terrified.
- Relax, okay?

20:11.054 --> 20:12.387
Everybody?
All right?

20:12.422 --> 20:13.454
We're not doing anything
till we get

20:13.490 --> 20:14.455
the details of the murder.

20:14.491 --> 20:15.590
And their status.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.425
Look, if they
deserve asylum,

20:17.460 --> 20:21.095
it could be Christmas
for these folks, kid.

20:23.033 --> 20:24.432
Now, I got a translator waiting.

20:24.467 --> 20:25.667
You want to question them
or not?

20:25.702 --> 20:27.669
Have a seat.

20:27.704 --> 20:30.805
I'm Agent Booth.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.608
I'm here to find out what happened to
your friend Min-Yung.

20:37.013 --> 20:40.615
This is Chao-xing,
but she's known as Tammy here.

20:40.650 --> 20:42.050
She'll be speaking
for the group.

20:42.085 --> 20:43.618
I need to talk
to everyone.

20:43.653 --> 20:45.920
Look at them, Booth,
they're not gonna talk.

20:48.558 --> 20:51.192
Be thankful
they trust Tammy.

20:57.867 --> 21:01.035
Do you recognize this woman?

21:02.605 --> 21:03.971
It's Min-Yung.
When was the last time

21:04.007 --> 21:06.574
you saw her?

21:06.609 --> 21:10.378
Last week, Monday night.

21:10.413 --> 21:12.814
I just came home from work

21:12.849 --> 21:14.449
at the nail salon.

21:14.484 --> 21:17.118
And she came back
from cleaning houses.

21:17.153 --> 21:18.686
That means
she was killed Monday night.

21:23.226 --> 21:25.293
Look, Min-Yung was hurt.

21:25.328 --> 21:26.627
She was bruised.
Someone hit her.

21:28.164 --> 21:30.932
Looks like you
were hit, too.

21:30.967 --> 21:33.568
Who hit you?

21:41.444 --> 21:43.878
Get him out of here!

21:43.913 --> 21:45.046
Let's go.

21:48.685 --> 21:51.052
Tammy,

21:51.087 --> 21:52.587
it's okay,
it's okay.

21:52.622 --> 21:54.689
You're safe with
Agent Booth.

21:56.226 --> 21:57.859
All of us are here to help you.

22:02.632 --> 22:04.132
That's a really nice bag.

22:04.167 --> 22:06.501
Did you bring that with you

22:06.536 --> 22:08.536
from Yanbian?

22:08.571 --> 22:09.937
Did you make it?

22:12.375 --> 22:13.775
My daughter.

22:14.844 --> 22:16.577
She stitched the pattern.

22:16.613 --> 22:18.880
It's our mountain back home.

22:18.915 --> 22:20.348
How old is your daughter?

22:25.288 --> 22:26.554
Eight.

22:26.589 --> 22:28.256
Her name is Yena.

22:30.260 --> 22:33.027
I came to help her,
to help my family.

22:33.062 --> 22:36.397
He said he'd hurt Yena.

22:39.269 --> 22:40.269
He said it'd be easy.

22:40.303 --> 22:42.036
He'd hurt us and our families.

22:42.071 --> 22:43.671
Who said that?

22:43.706 --> 22:46.574
Victor.

22:46.609 --> 22:49.043
Son of a bitch.
Traffickers threaten

22:49.078 --> 22:51.379
to maim or kill family members
all the time.

22:51.414 --> 22:53.181
It's easier than using locks
and chains.

22:54.284 --> 22:55.116
Is Yena okay?

22:58.988 --> 22:59.987
Can I talk to my daughter?

23:00.023 --> 23:03.224
Please, I need to hear
her voice.

23:03.259 --> 23:05.860
He wouldn't let us call home.

23:15.004 --> 23:17.104
D-Do I really have to translate?

23:33.389 --> 23:34.389
Andy Dolmar.

23:34.390 --> 23:35.923
You got to be kidding me.

23:35.959 --> 23:37.558
How does this lowlife
afford you?

23:37.594 --> 23:39.227
Sometimes I do
pro Bono work, you know?

23:39.262 --> 23:41.929
I'm sure you do--
during tax deduction time.

23:41.965 --> 23:44.031
I have a busy day,
agent Booth.

23:44.067 --> 23:46.300
You've yet to prove anything
against my client, so...

23:46.336 --> 23:47.735
He's keeping slaves.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:47.770 --> 23:51.472
Kid, my client believed
all of his employees

23:51.507 --> 23:52.607
were legal immigrants.

23:52.642 --> 23:54.508
I think we're done here.
He maintains his innocence.

23:54.544 --> 23:57.144
Right, he can maintain
it in jail. Let's go.

23:57.180 --> 24:00.047
Come on. This guy's getting
paid by someone else. Come on.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.917
We know you
beat those women, Victor.

24:02.952 --> 24:06.387
I don't care how
many snakes you hire.

24:06.422 --> 24:08.522
You're gonna pay.

24:10.994 --> 24:12.460
<i>So I</i>

24:12.495 --> 24:14.629
put together
all the poop paper

24:14.664 --> 24:16.797
that Hodgins got
from the goats.

24:16.833 --> 24:18.833
And your genius
saved the day?

24:18.868 --> 24:21.669
Yeah, but you're not
paying attention.

24:21.704 --> 24:23.804
Sorry. Um...

24:23.840 --> 24:25.773
Oh, you did it.
It's fuzzy,

24:25.808 --> 24:28.276
but, um, I' m with you.
Continue.

24:28.311 --> 24:30.311
Is this about
your fight with Arastoo?

24:30.346 --> 24:31.145
Oh, God.

24:31.180 --> 24:32.747
We're office gossip now?

24:32.782 --> 24:35.449
No, it's because we care about
you two, Cam.

24:35.485 --> 24:37.018
Well, uh, we're...
we're fine, Angela.

24:37.053 --> 24:39.086
I d... I do
appreciate your concern,

24:39.122 --> 24:41.322
but we are fine.

24:41.357 --> 24:43.024
Okay.

24:43.059 --> 24:46.727
You've I.D.'d the man
in Min-Yung's photo?

24:46.763 --> 24:49.497
Almost.
I-I ran the photo

24:49.532 --> 24:51.098
through the State Department's
database,

24:51.134 --> 24:53.100
figuring that he was
an immigrant too,

24:53.136 --> 24:55.036
but I came up with
five matches

24:55.071 --> 24:56.337
because
of the image quality.

24:57.573 --> 24:58.806
Number three.

24:58.841 --> 25:00.374
Based on the prominent
zygomatics,

25:00.410 --> 25:03.010
your man is number three--
Sung Dae Park.

25:03.046 --> 25:06.080
Okay, let's see what info
we have on him.

25:06.115 --> 25:08.582
Oh, he's also from Yanbian.

25:08.618 --> 25:10.918
Been here
two and a half years.

25:10.954 --> 25:13.487
- Oh, Sung is a fugitive.
- What?

25:13.523 --> 25:16.190
He's wanted in Yanbian
for the murder of

25:16.225 --> 25:18.225
Min-Yung's father.
That's probably why he

25:18.261 --> 25:20.428
escaped to the States--
to evade law enforcement.

25:20.463 --> 25:22.763
And that's why Min-Yung
was so determined to get here.

25:22.799 --> 25:24.532
To avenge her father's murder.

25:24.567 --> 25:26.167
But it seems like
when she confronted <i> him,</i>

25:26.202 --> 25:28.202
Sung killed <i> her.</i>

25:34.459 --> 25:36.159
<i> Find Sung?</i>

25:36.194 --> 25:38.074
Seems he works construction.
I checked out crews

25:38.096 --> 25:39.796
local to the area.
Turns out one uses

25:39.831 --> 25:41.698
predominantly
Asian workers.

25:41.733 --> 25:43.566
Crew's working
over on Litchfield.

25:43.602 --> 25:45.969
Right, okay, well, then
if that's all we got,

25:46.004 --> 25:47.837
it's our... our best bet,
let's get going.

25:47.872 --> 25:50.206
One more thing.

25:50.242 --> 25:52.675
An apology, I guess.

25:52.711 --> 25:55.912
I was sort of ass-like.

25:55.947 --> 25:57.547
Because you were looking
at other people's pain

25:57.582 --> 25:59.415
for what it could do
for your own career.

25:59.451 --> 26:01.818
Yeah.

26:02.721 --> 26:04.721
But once I saw those women,

26:04.756 --> 26:08.591
thought about Min-Yung's life
and how she died...

26:08.627 --> 26:09.892
Ass.

26:09.928 --> 26:12.095
Yeah. Won't happen again.

26:12.130 --> 26:13.796
Right.
Yes, it will.

26:13.832 --> 26:17.333
But, uh, what you have here
is a good start, so-- good boy.

26:17.369 --> 26:20.169
Uh, okay... Just kind of sounded like
you were treating me like a dog, right--

26:20.205 --> 26:23.006
Aubrey, I don't have a
tennis ball I can throw

26:23.041 --> 26:25.408
out the front door here, so let's go.
Wow, okay.

26:25.443 --> 26:27.377
That's very insulting,
you know that? Even to an ass.

26:27.412 --> 26:28.711
<i>Dr. Brennan, we've</i>

26:28.747 --> 26:30.246
already catalogued
all the injuries.

26:30.282 --> 26:32.048
And yet we don't know
how she died.

26:32.083 --> 26:33.549
She bled out.

26:33.585 --> 26:34.951
But why?

26:34.986 --> 26:37.420
To fully exsanguinate,
we can postulate

26:37.455 --> 26:39.756
that at least one major
artery was severed.

26:39.791 --> 26:42.191
If that were the case,
evidence of the murder weapon

26:42.227 --> 26:45.762
would most likely be found
near those arteries.

26:45.797 --> 26:47.764
So we look again?

26:47.799 --> 26:51.501
We do.

26:51.536 --> 26:53.636
I should thank you, Dr. Brennan.

26:53.672 --> 26:55.138
For what?

26:55.173 --> 26:57.307
For busting me.
For making me work harder.

26:57.342 --> 26:59.642
My career is about more
than pleasing you.

26:59.678 --> 27:01.010
I should make a difference.

27:01.046 --> 27:02.345
Well, perhaps you won't.

27:02.380 --> 27:03.946
Excuse me?

27:03.982 --> 27:06.349
We can never
accurately predict

27:06.384 --> 27:08.518
what results our
efforts will generate,

27:08.553 --> 27:10.386
but as Tennyson said--

27:10.422 --> 27:11.988
"I follow up the quest.

27:12.023 --> 27:13.523
"Despite of day and night

27:13.558 --> 27:15.958
and death and hell."

27:15.994 --> 27:18.328
Hmm.

27:20.398 --> 27:24.300
There's something in the
pitting from the osteoporosis.

27:24.336 --> 27:26.869
Feel the left
transverse process

27:26.905 --> 27:29.939
of the C5 on the
anterior surface.

27:31.209 --> 27:32.975
Feels like a tiny puncture.

27:33.011 --> 27:35.712
See if there are any other nicks
on the surrounding bones.

27:35.747 --> 27:37.246
I'll ask Dr. Hodgins

27:37.282 --> 27:39.949
to swab the puncture for trace.

27:39.984 --> 27:42.518
Perhaps we can I.D. the weapon.

27:55.367 --> 27:56.866
Why am I here?

27:56.901 --> 27:58.401
You killed a girl.

28:00.138 --> 28:01.371
And I want to know why.

28:01.406 --> 28:02.905
Min-Yung?

28:02.941 --> 28:04.907
She is dead?
We found her body...

28:04.943 --> 28:08.111
in a field, in the middle of
nowhere, where you left her.

28:08.146 --> 28:09.912
You found her here?

28:09.948 --> 28:11.748
In the United States?

28:11.783 --> 28:13.216
Yeah. Where else?

28:13.251 --> 28:14.851
He looks upset.
Yeah, because

28:14.886 --> 28:16.052
he's been caught.

28:16.087 --> 28:18.221
That is not possible.

28:18.256 --> 28:20.656
My Min-Yung is
back in Yanbian.

28:20.692 --> 28:22.558
<i>Your</i> Min-Yung?
Yes.

28:22.594 --> 28:25.094
We were to be
married, but...

28:25.130 --> 28:27.063
she's not here.

28:27.098 --> 28:28.965
You... You must
have made a mistake.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.633
No, you're the one
who made the mistake,

28:30.668 --> 28:32.468
'cause we know
you killed her father.

28:34.239 --> 28:36.939
Yes. I killed him.

28:38.309 --> 28:39.809
Why would she marry

28:39.844 --> 28:42.111
the man who killed
her father?

28:42.147 --> 28:43.379
He did things.

28:43.415 --> 28:45.415
Terrible things.
He was selling her

28:45.450 --> 28:47.383
to someone in
the village.

28:49.287 --> 28:51.888
When I saw him...

28:51.923 --> 28:54.557
beating her...

28:56.661 --> 28:59.295
I did it for her.
She knew. She-She loved me.

28:59.330 --> 29:00.930
Yeah, but you ran.

29:00.965 --> 29:02.899
You left her.
To make money.

29:02.934 --> 29:05.735
For a new life for us.

29:05.770 --> 29:08.971
But the people who
brought me here,

29:09.007 --> 29:11.674
they took everything.

29:11.709 --> 29:14.243
He was traffic like she was?

29:14.279 --> 29:16.345
Welcome to hell, kid.

29:18.883 --> 29:20.450
I was to send for her,

29:20.485 --> 29:22.752
but I could not.

29:24.456 --> 29:28.324
Are you sure this is Min-Yung?

29:32.630 --> 29:34.831
Yeah.

29:39.504 --> 29:41.804
She must have come

29:41.840 --> 29:44.707
to find me.

29:49.013 --> 29:52.348
Her death is my fault.

29:52.383 --> 29:55.918
Why would anyone hurt her?

29:55.954 --> 29:59.021
She was kind and she...

30:00.892 --> 30:03.025
she-she was my heart.

30:22.847 --> 30:25.615
What's gonna happen to him?
He's wanted for murder back home.

30:25.650 --> 30:28.484
Well, you just gonna send him back?
I'm gonna put him in the system.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.152
I have to.
Yeah, but if he was just protecting her...

30:30.188 --> 30:31.921
All right, look, look,
you just gotta do something.

30:31.956 --> 30:33.789
You got to make sure he's
treated fairly back there.

30:33.825 --> 30:35.324
It's the least you can do.
Thanks.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.793
Because I needed
to be reminded to be fair.

30:37.829 --> 30:39.695
Find the girl's killer.

30:39.731 --> 30:43.332
'Cause if you don't,
that guy's gonna fry for it.

30:43.368 --> 30:44.214
Why?

30:44.238 --> 30:45.937
Why, why-- because,
you know, he's got motive.

30:45.937 --> 30:47.803
He's an immigrant, all right?
He's an easy target.

30:47.839 --> 30:49.939
It's a prosecutor's dream.
That's why.

30:55.079 --> 30:58.180
Sung told Booth that
Roth Construction

30:58.216 --> 31:00.283
and Sunny Helpers
use the same recruiters,

31:00.318 --> 31:02.318
so I looked into their
financial background

31:02.353 --> 31:04.153
to see if I could find
any connection.

31:04.188 --> 31:06.088
She loved Sung so much

31:06.124 --> 31:07.790
that she walked
through the snow and over

31:07.825 --> 31:09.692
mountains to get
here to be with him.

31:09.727 --> 31:11.861
And that's how
she lost her toes.

31:11.896 --> 31:14.063
They were so close
to finding each other.

31:14.098 --> 31:16.132
Okay, don't make me cry,
honey, I'm working.

31:16.167 --> 31:18.367
So I traced the two
investors back through

31:18.403 --> 31:21.804
a series of shell corporations
and overseas accounts, and

31:21.839 --> 31:23.406
you're not gonna believe
what I came up with.

31:23.441 --> 31:25.408
What is Common Reach?
It's the company

31:25.443 --> 31:28.044
that owns both Sunny Helpers
and Roth Construction.

31:28.079 --> 31:30.310
They also have factories
in China and Yanbian.

31:30.311 --> 31:32.415
And it's run by the woman
whose watch

31:32.450 --> 31:34.750
was found on Min-Yung.

31:35.787 --> 31:37.920
Sandra Zins.

31:42.799 --> 31:43.829
Andy Delmar

31:43.829 --> 31:45.667
You've got to be kidding me.
You know him, Booth?

31:45.668 --> 31:46.967
Yeah, it's Victor Lee's
lawyer, too.

31:47.002 --> 31:48.569
This dirtbag gets around.

31:48.604 --> 31:50.504
All right, let's relax
with the name-calling.

31:50.539 --> 31:52.639
No, I tell you what--
why don't we have one more,

31:52.675 --> 31:54.241
just for your
client, okay?

31:54.276 --> 31:56.043
Human trafficking murderer.
I never murdered anyone,

31:56.078 --> 31:58.145
and you have
no proof that I did.

31:58.180 --> 31:59.580
I helped needy people...

31:59.615 --> 32:01.815
You import slaves.
I'm an immigrant myself.

32:01.850 --> 32:03.417
I know how hard it is

32:03.452 --> 32:05.485
to get on here.
That's what it takes in America.

32:05.521 --> 32:07.841
All of these women received a salary...
Just enough to keep

32:07.856 --> 32:09.489
paying the people
who brought them here.

32:09.525 --> 32:11.625
I'm sure you got a taste of that, too.
I have no idea

32:11.660 --> 32:13.493
what you're talking about.
Ms. Zins is an upstanding member

32:13.529 --> 32:15.128
of the community...
You know what-- let's bring in

32:15.164 --> 32:17.064
the facts, okay, shall we...

32:17.099 --> 32:18.865
dirtbag?
Here come the facts.

32:18.901 --> 32:21.201
Hello, I'm Alex Radziwill
with the State Department.

32:21.236 --> 32:23.904
You're with the State Department?
Yeah. They need somebody

32:23.939 --> 32:26.773
low to the ground to deal with
the bottom-feeders.

32:26.809 --> 32:29.176
Hard data shows
you finance

32:29.211 --> 32:31.812
and benefit from a trafficking
ring out of Yanbian.

32:33.482 --> 32:35.115
How did
they get these?

32:35.150 --> 32:37.417
You used your
connections in Asia

32:37.453 --> 32:38.752
to bring those people
to this country

32:38.787 --> 32:40.687
so you could
exploit them.

32:40.723 --> 32:43.490
You are going to prison
for a very, very long time.

32:43.525 --> 32:44.270
Very long time.

32:44.294 --> 32:45.960
And on top of this,
we can add the murder charge.

32:45.961 --> 32:47.828
- No, I've never killed anyone.
- I think we're done here.

32:47.863 --> 32:49.363
I will look these over.

32:49.398 --> 32:52.432
So unless you want
to arrest my client...

32:52.468 --> 32:53.867
Great idea.
You know what? I'd love to.

32:53.902 --> 32:55.235
Come on in.
No...

32:55.270 --> 32:56.536
You are under arrest.

32:56.572 --> 32:58.171
No.

32:58.207 --> 33:00.641
Wait, wait!

33:00.676 --> 33:03.143
I was giving them a chance!

33:06.148 --> 33:08.482
Booth doesn't have
enough for a murder charge.

33:08.517 --> 33:10.450
If we don't find
something in 24 hours,

33:10.486 --> 33:12.252
he's going to have
to let Sandra Zins go.

33:12.287 --> 33:13.787
I may have something.

33:13.822 --> 33:17.324
And abrasion on the inferior
margin of the mandible.

33:17.359 --> 33:19.393
I cast a mold of the
abrasion so we can match it

33:19.428 --> 33:21.928
to the other and hopefully
get a murder weapon.

33:21.964 --> 33:24.765
Excellent work as usual,
Mr. Vaziri.

33:24.800 --> 33:28.802
The marks appear
to be serrations.

33:28.837 --> 33:31.204
It has to be some kind of knife.
I disagree!

33:31.240 --> 33:33.974
The striations are
too broad for a knife.

33:34.009 --> 33:36.843
But based on the location

33:36.879 --> 33:38.412
and directionality, the wound

33:38.447 --> 33:40.714
would've severed
the carotid artery.

33:40.749 --> 33:42.315
So, we found cause of death?
Yes.

33:42.351 --> 33:45.152
You did.
I'll give this mold to Angela

33:45.187 --> 33:47.721
so she can start
looking for a weapon.

33:53.328 --> 33:56.196
Okay, well, the
serrations don't appear

33:56.231 --> 33:58.131
to be caused by
a blade, sweetie.

33:58.167 --> 34:00.667
More like grooves
than serrations.

34:00.703 --> 34:02.035
Exactly.

34:02.071 --> 34:05.505
So, I'm going
to remove any knife

34:05.541 --> 34:07.074
or bladed tool.

34:07.109 --> 34:08.507
And anything
without a pointed tip

34:08.543 --> 34:10.243
because of the puncture wound
on the C-5.

34:10.279 --> 34:11.712
Right.

34:11.746 --> 34:13.647
That leaves the grater.

34:13.681 --> 34:15.114
The grater comes

34:15.150 --> 34:17.484
the closest, but it's too wide,

34:17.518 --> 34:19.719
and it doesn't have
the right point.

34:19.755 --> 34:23.456
The grater... it's like
a ridging pattern.

34:23.492 --> 34:26.493
Just... ridging to smooth.

34:26.527 --> 34:29.029
Uh, you know you're just
babbling now, right?

34:29.063 --> 34:30.230
To smooth.

34:30.264 --> 34:32.466
Nails. Nails. A manicure.

34:32.501 --> 34:34.201
Could you run that
by me one more time?

34:34.235 --> 34:35.569
That's how she died.

34:35.603 --> 34:37.137
From a bad manicure?

34:37.172 --> 34:38.833
Bring up the instruments
used in a manicure.

34:38.858 --> 34:40.074
Okay.

34:41.476 --> 34:43.210
That one-- the
cuticle pusher.

34:43.245 --> 34:45.245
Really? That doesn't
look very deadly.

34:45.280 --> 34:48.348
But it was.

34:48.382 --> 34:50.484
Whoa!

34:50.518 --> 34:51.918
I'll tell Booth.

34:51.954 --> 34:53.920
Well, how did the...?

34:53.956 --> 34:56.822
It's okay. I don't need to know.

34:56.859 --> 34:58.759
Wouldn't dream
of holding you up.

34:59.928 --> 35:02.262
Booth? Booth?
Found the murder weapon.

35:02.297 --> 35:03.630
It was a cuticle pusher.

35:03.665 --> 35:05.999
Oh, like, for nails?
Yes.

35:06.034 --> 35:08.030
I-I don't know if this helps
with Sandra Zins, but...

35:08.054 --> 35:08.603
No, it doesn't.

35:08.604 --> 35:10.537
No, not at all, but it...
it does solve the case.

35:10.572 --> 35:12.372
You did it.
What? How? You...

35:12.407 --> 35:14.040
I usually know
when I've solved the case.

35:14.076 --> 35:15.809
Booth, this is
very disconcerting.

35:15.844 --> 35:17.210
Booth!

35:17.246 --> 35:20.247
Tammy, we know you
killed Min-Yung.

35:22.618 --> 35:24.317
Oh. Oh.

35:26.021 --> 35:27.721
No. I didn't kill anyone.

35:27.756 --> 35:30.724
Okay, look, we know
that you worked at a nail salon.

35:30.759 --> 35:32.893
You just...

35:32.928 --> 35:34.694
You used a cuticle pusher.

35:37.099 --> 35:39.633
You stabbed her with it

35:39.668 --> 35:41.501
repeatedly until she bled out.

35:45.007 --> 35:46.506
No.

35:46.542 --> 35:47.741
Booth-- her strap.

35:47.776 --> 35:50.310
It looks like it
might have been used

35:50.345 --> 35:52.612
to cause the dislocations
on the victim's wrists.

35:52.648 --> 35:55.448
We need her bag. Can you have
her put her bag on the table?

36:11.934 --> 36:13.567
Oh.

36:13.602 --> 36:15.936
There's blood.

36:15.971 --> 36:18.338
Why would she use

36:18.373 --> 36:20.273
the bag to tie up Min-Yung?

36:20.309 --> 36:22.108
Not tie her up, Booth.

36:22.144 --> 36:24.611
Drag her. She wrapped

36:24.646 --> 36:26.713
the strap around
Min-Yung's wrist,

36:26.748 --> 36:30.116
giving her increased leverage
to drag her off the road.

36:31.587 --> 36:33.186
It was her fault.

36:33.222 --> 36:34.821
Wait, wait. What? Wh-Why?

36:37.759 --> 36:39.192
The week before...

36:41.496 --> 36:43.864
Victor found out Min-Yung was
sneaking out of the house.

36:43.899 --> 36:44.831
Sneaking out?

36:47.936 --> 36:48.869
Looking for Sung.

36:50.239 --> 36:51.239
The man from her village.

36:52.474 --> 36:55.308
The man she loved.

36:56.745 --> 36:58.945
Victor-- he beat her.

36:58.981 --> 37:02.182
That's consistent
with the remodeled

37:02.217 --> 37:04.251
injuries on the sternum.

37:08.790 --> 37:12.659
Victor said, if he caught her
again, he would punish us all.

37:12.694 --> 37:16.029
Even your families back home.

37:19.234 --> 37:22.068
You killed her to stop her.

37:28.977 --> 37:30.744
She said she loved him.

37:30.779 --> 37:32.245
She had to find him.

37:34.182 --> 37:35.682
But we also
love people.

37:35.717 --> 37:37.384
Our families.

37:40.822 --> 37:42.255
My daughter.

37:43.659 --> 37:46.159
She hadn't done
anything wrong.

on forensic methods

39:26.395 --> 39:28.061

atrocities.

39:28.096 --> 39:30.063
Maybe if we can

Christine's asleep.

40:55.750 --> 40:58.017
She wanted me to tell you
that she loves you.

40:58.053 --> 41:00.887
And she wants pancakes shaped
like Mickey Mouse for breakfast.

41:00.922 --> 41:04.891
Ah... no, I can
handle that. Cheers.

41:12.601 --> 41:15.602
Don't ever let me take any
of this for granted, Bones.

41:15.637 --> 41:17.804
How lucky we are.

41:17.839 --> 41:21.107
I won't.

41:21.143 --> 41:24.310
I just can't stop thinking
about Tammy and that...

41:24.346 --> 41:26.279
and the situation
that she was in.

41:26.314 --> 41:27.814
If-if I was in that situation,

41:27.849 --> 41:30.884
how I would protect you
and-and Christine.

41:30.919 --> 41:35.121
Life puts us
in untenable positions.

41:35.157 --> 41:39.826
And out of those--
it sounds horrible, but...

41:39.861 --> 41:42.695
if Min-Yung hadn't been killed,

41:42.731 --> 41:46.466
scores of people would still
be living as slaves.

41:52.974 --> 41:55.341
Silver lining?

41:55.377 --> 41:57.877
Yeah.

42:00.048 --> 42:03.917
For me, I keep thinking
about her trying to find Sung.

42:03.952 --> 42:06.719
I could have so
easily been like her,

42:06.755 --> 42:10.723
just missing the opportunity
to live my life with you.

42:12.127 --> 42:15.328
I would thank a God,
if I believed in one.

42:15.363 --> 42:18.965
Then I'll do it for you.

42:22.037 --> 42:27.040
Okay? Here.

42:28.443 --> 42:30.843
There it is.
