35:16.815 --> 35:18.217
I feel ridiculous!

35:18.250 --> 35:19.318
You look great.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.820
You could give
the vampire squid
a run for her money.

the sea lions.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.591
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

35:34.600 --> 35:36.001
You came back.

35:36.034 --> 35:37.135
Yeah.

(SNIFFLES)

35:51.317 --> 35:52.584
Thank God.

35:56.588 --> 35:57.789
We'll stop this.

35:58.757 --> 35:59.858
It'll be all right.

36:04.129 --> 36:06.665
Doctor, you got
to get this stuff
out of her IV.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.033
You don't need it.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.238
If you have to be careful
about getting hurt,

36:12.271 --> 36:13.805
I'll be there to help you.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.876
The "stuff" was removed
some time ago.

36:19.445 --> 36:20.912
Before Dr. Browne
went off-shift,

36:20.946 --> 36:23.582
she told me that Lily
was experiencing
some problems.

36:23.615 --> 36:26.852
So I thought it best
to discontinue the
medication for a while.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.587
She's as she was
when you left her.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.856
**

36:32.157 --> 36:33.492
You never cry.

36:39.565 --> 36:42.100
When I saw you
sitting there,

36:42.133 --> 36:44.570
I've never been so happy
in my whole life.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.845
(SNIFFLES)

37:01.387 --> 37:04.189
I thought you
didn't want to
"make a fuss."

37:05.524 --> 37:06.558
Yeah.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.193
Who knew?

37:43.729 --> 37:45.263
(SIGHS)
This seems weird.

37:46.932 --> 37:48.133
It is weird.

37:49.901 --> 37:53.705
Most people have
some kind of ritual
all ready for them

37:53.739 --> 37:56.274
so they don't have to think
about this kind of stuff.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.078
You got a prayer?

38:01.447 --> 38:03.014
I'm not religious.

38:03.048 --> 38:04.950
Neither was my mom.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.618
Everybody has
a religion.

38:08.320 --> 38:11.423
Not everybody has a god,
but everybody has a religion.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.165
Music.

38:22.334 --> 38:24.135
Your mother's religion
was music.

38:28.273 --> 38:29.274
Sing.

38:32.143 --> 38:35.313

at a drag pride party?

38:35.347 --> 38:37.949
(CHUCKLES)

38:37.983 --> 38:41.252
Or you can just
dump it out
and feel weird.
