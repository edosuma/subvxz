10:31.805 --> 10:33.720
SOCIAL WORKERS, EH?

10:33.763 --> 10:36.636
LAST MONTH, RODDY AND EILEEN
HAD A BIT OF A GO,

10:36.679 --> 10:40.030
AND THE COPS CAME AND THEY
MADE A BIG DEAL OF NOTHING,

10:40.074 --> 10:41.902
AND THEY CALLED IN
CHILD WELFARE.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.730
IT WAS A BUNCH OF NONSENSE.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.557
EILEEN AND RODDY
LOVE EACH OTHER,

10:45.601 --> 10:47.777
AND THEY'RE GREAT PARENTS.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.300
WHAT KIND OF CAR
WAS RODDY DRIVING?

10:49.344 --> 10:51.346
GEE, I...
I DON'T KNOW.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.435
I THINK HE BORROWED IT
FROM A FRIEND.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.611
WHAT'S HIS FRIEND'S NAME?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.700
I DON'T REMEMBER.
DO YOU REMEMBER?

10:57.744 --> 10:58.832
NOPE.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.529
CAITLYN'S LIFE
IS AT STAKE HERE.

11:00.572 --> 11:02.574
WE NEED YOUR COOPERATION.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.795
RODDY DIDN'T KILL EILEEN,
SO HE HASN'T GOT CAITLYN.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.623
YOU HAD ANOTHER NAME IN MIND.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.929
NO NAME IN MIND.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.713
ALL RIGHT. HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.019
[exhales]

11:12.062 --> 11:14.674
PETE'S CALLING RODDY
RIGHT NOW.

11:14.717 --> 11:17.198
IF RODDY'S INNOCENT,
WHICH I THINK HE IS,

11:17.241 --> 11:19.330
HE'LL FEEL COMPELLED
TO GO TO THE CRIME SCENE.

11:19.374 --> 11:21.419
IF HE'S INNOCENT, WHY NOT
CONTACT THE POLICE?

11:21.463 --> 11:23.291
OH, 'CAUSE NO MAN IN THAT
FAMILY'S GONNA WILLINGLY

11:23.334 --> 11:26.511
CONTACT THE POLICE.[cell phone rings]

11:26.555 --> 11:27.817
HEY.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.732
[Rigsby] Hi, boss.WHERE ARE YOU?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.212
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SANDRA GUZMAN,

11:31.255 --> 11:32.735
THE MOTEL MAID
THAT FOUND THE BODY.

11:32.779 --> 11:35.129
SHE'S PLAYING HARD TO GET.Oh, take a break from that.

11:35.172 --> 11:38.001
GET TO THE MOTEL AS QUICK
AS YOU CAN AND STAKE IT OUT.

11:38.045 --> 11:39.786
WE THINK THE VICTIM'S HUSBAND
MIGHT BE HEADED OVER THERE.

11:39.829 --> 11:42.223
TELL HIM HE'S INNOCENT.
WE JUST NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.094
UH, WE DON'T KNOW
IF HE'S INVOLVED,

11:44.138 --> 11:45.400
BUT BRING HIM IN.
BE CAREFUL.

11:45.443 --> 11:46.706
WILL DO.

11:48.838 --> 11:52.450
[fastens seat belt]WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
RODDY TURNER'S INNOCENT?

11:52.494 --> 11:54.235
WELL, I'M NOT SURE ABOUT
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

11:54.278 --> 11:55.627
EXCEPT THAT YOU WON'T TELL ME
THE NAMES ON THE LIST.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.238
YOU'RE SURE OF THAT.

11:57.281 --> 11:59.719
YEAH, WELL, I SHOULD TELL YOU
WHY I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU.

11:59.762 --> 12:01.721
SOME OF THE NAMES
ARE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW,

12:01.764 --> 12:03.810
AND YOU'LL START ACTING
DIFFERENTLY AROUND THEM,

12:03.853 --> 12:05.681
AND YOU MAY TIP THEM OFF.WHAT?! NO, I WON'T!

12:05.725 --> 12:07.248
WELL... [sighs]
YES, YOU WILL.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.250
YOU CAN'T HELP YOURSELF.
I MEAN, NO OFFENSE,

12:09.293 --> 12:10.773
BUT YOU HAVE NO DISHONESTY
IN YOU.

12:10.817 --> 12:14.037
I HAVE DISHONESTY IN ME.
I CAN PUT ON A FRONT.

12:14.081 --> 12:15.952
THIS IS YOU PUTTING ON
A FRONT...

12:17.388 --> 12:19.608
NO, IT'S NOT.
I CAN KEEP SECRETS.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.131
OH, OKAY.

12:21.175 --> 12:23.873
[starts engine]

12:27.703 --> 12:29.705
I HAVE SECRETS FROM YOU.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.663
SECRETS YOU CANNOT IMAGINE.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.927
RIGHT. WELL, OF COURSE.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.755
HOW ABOUT I TELL YOU
THREE THINGS ABOUT YOU

12:35.798 --> 12:37.757
THAT YOU THINK ARE SECRETS
FROM ME THAT I ACTUALLY KNOW?

12:37.800 --> 12:39.193
THEN WILL YOU BE CONVINCED?

12:39.236 --> 12:41.456
SURE. GO AHEAD.OKAY.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.763
YOU KNOW WHAT? WAIT.
DON'T BOTHER.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.330
I WON'T STOOP TO PLAYING
YOUR SILLY GAMES.

12:46.374 --> 12:47.505
WISE CALL.

12:47.549 --> 12:49.464
[exhales]

12:49.507 --> 12:51.771
ARE THESE PEOPLE
I KNOW WELL?VERY WELL.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.685
J.J. LaROCHE?NO.

12:53.729 --> 12:56.732
ARDILES?HMM. INTERESTING GUESS. NO.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.603
WOULD YOU TELL ME
IF I GUESS RIGHT?

13:00.344 --> 13:01.432
NOPE.

13:01.476 --> 13:02.738
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.702
SO WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU?

13:10.746 --> 13:12.313
NOTHING.

13:12.356 --> 13:15.707
SAME OLD, SAME OLD, HUH?

13:15.751 --> 13:18.885
YEAH, ME, TOO, PRETTY MUCH.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.756
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.YEAH, I KNOW.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.540
YOU KNOW?

13:22.584 --> 13:23.846
YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:23.890 --> 13:25.674
YOU AND VAN PELT
ARE HAVING SEX AGAIN.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.937
HMM. Y-YEAH.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.417
YES.

13:29.460 --> 13:30.897
[exhales]I MEAN, I WOULDN'T
CALL IT THAT.

13:30.940 --> 13:35.118
"HAVING SEX."
KIND OF... CLINICAL.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.511
YOU'RE NOT HAVING SEX?

13:36.554 --> 13:39.688
NO. UH... YES, WE ARE,
OF COURSE.

13:39.731 --> 13:41.559
BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.300
WE'RE IN LOVE.

13:43.344 --> 13:45.868
YEAH? NO KIDDING.
CONGRATULATIONS.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.261
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

13:47.304 --> 13:49.350
WE WERE KEEPING IT
ON THE WAY DOWN LOW.GOOD JOB.

13:49.393 --> 13:51.700
[tires screech]

13:58.489 --> 14:00.665
[door open alert chimes][sighs]

14:02.145 --> 14:04.234
COULD I HELP YOU?[grunts]

14:04.278 --> 14:06.889
[officer groans]

14:06.933 --> 14:09.326
[officer coughs]

14:09.370 --> 14:11.589
[panting]

14:11.633 --> 14:13.417
[door thuds open]

14:16.986 --> 14:17.987
WHERE IS SHE?

14:18.031 --> 14:19.423
RODDY, STOP THAT RIGHT NOW!

14:19.467 --> 14:21.948
PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!
DO IT NOW!

14:21.991 --> 14:23.688
I WAS JUST DOING MY JOB,
AND THIS MANIAC

14:23.732 --> 14:25.908
COMES IN AND ATTACKS ME!
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA DIE!

14:25.952 --> 14:27.910
YOU'RE ALIVE. BE QUIET.WHERE ARE THEY?

14:27.954 --> 14:30.217
SIR, WE UNDERSTAND YOUR ANGER,
AND WE'RE SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS,

14:30.260 --> 14:32.088
BUT WE WANT TO TALK QUIETLY
SOMEPLACE.

14:32.132 --> 14:34.743
YOU NEED TO COME BACK
TO OUR OFFICE.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.877
WHEN DID SHE LEAVE YOU?

14:37.920 --> 14:39.791
[clicks tongue]

14:39.835 --> 14:43.099
[inhales and exhales deeply]

14:44.405 --> 14:46.450
RODDY, YOU NEED TO TALK TO US.

14:46.494 --> 14:48.409
IF YOU DIDN'T DO THIS,
WE NEED TO KNOW

14:48.452 --> 14:50.411
SO WE CAN FIND THE MAN
RESPONSIBLE.

14:50.454 --> 14:51.934
AND FIND YOUR CHILD.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.719
YOU WANT TO HELP US
FIND CAITLYN, RIGHT?

14:54.763 --> 14:56.896
LET ME GO.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.898
YOU ASSAULTED A COP
AND A CSI TECHNICIAN.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.247
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

15:00.290 --> 15:03.119
I NEED TO FIND ME DAUGHTER.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.992
PLEASE. LET ME GO.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.646
HMM. HE DIDN'T DO IT.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.387
HOLD ON.
UH, IF HE DID DO IT,

15:10.431 --> 15:11.823
HE DID AT AS SOME SORT
OF ACCOMPLICE

15:11.867 --> 15:12.955
TO RED JOHN, RIGHT?

15:12.999 --> 15:14.304
TRUE.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.567
BUT RED JOHN ALWAYS OFFERS
HIS FRIENDS

15:16.611 --> 15:18.221
SOMETHING
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE.

15:18.265 --> 15:19.831
WHY DOES RODDY NEED
RED JOHN?

15:19.875 --> 15:21.833
I MEAN, WHAT'S HIS MOTIVE?
WHERE'S HIS CHILD?

15:21.877 --> 15:23.705
GOOD QUESTIONS.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.098
STILL, I GET
THE DISTINCT FEELING

15:25.141 --> 15:26.577
THAT HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

15:26.621 --> 15:27.839
ME, TOO.

15:27.883 --> 15:30.668
SAME THING PETE AND SAMANTHA
WERE HIDING.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.540
SOMEONE ELSE THEY SUSPECT.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.021
WHICH WOULD SUGGEST
A FAMILY DISPUTE.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.371
YES, IT DOES.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.547
WHO IS EILEEN'S FAMILY?
WHERE'S SHE FROM?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.985
FAMILY NAME IS BARLOW.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.031
BARLOW?

15:45.074 --> 15:46.989
YEAH, SHE WAS BORN
IN MODESTO.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.861
HER PARENTS WERE KEVIN
AND SUZANNE BARLOW.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.907
UH, THEY WERE KILLED
IN A CAR ACCIDENT

15:51.951 --> 15:53.953
WHEN SHE WAS 3 YEARS OLD.

15:55.084 --> 15:57.869
SHE'S LEELEE BARLOW.

15:57.913 --> 16:02.004
YOU KNEW HER?WELL, AFTER EILEEN'S PARENTS
WERE KILLED, UH,

16:02.048 --> 16:04.006
SHE WAS RAISED
BY HER UNCLE SEAN.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.704
HE WAS VERY CLOSE
WITH MY FATHER.OH.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.750
YEAH, WELL, THEY FELL OUT
OVER A BUSINESS DEAL,

16:08.793 --> 16:10.012
BECAME ENEMIES.

16:10.056 --> 16:13.189
BUT, UH, I HAVEN'T SEEN
EILEEN OR SEAN

16:13.233 --> 16:15.017
FOR AT LEAST 30 YEARS.

16:15.061 --> 16:17.498
UH, YOU THINK THAT EILEEN'S
MURDERER IS MAYBE CONNECTED

16:17.541 --> 16:19.282
TO THIS SEAN BARLOW?WELL, PETE THINKS SO.

16:19.326 --> 16:21.067
OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE
TOLD ME WHO SHE WAS.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.982
WHAT ELSE?

16:23.025 --> 16:24.374
HMM?

16:24.418 --> 16:26.159
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT
REMEMBERING EILEEN BARLOW

16:26.202 --> 16:27.725
THAT FREAKED YOU OUT--
WHAT IS IT?

16:27.769 --> 16:29.336
OH, YOU'RE GETTING GOOD,
LISBON.

16:29.379 --> 16:32.165
DON'T PATRONIZE ME.
JUST TELL ME. WHAT'S THE DEAL?

16:33.818 --> 16:35.516
[clicks tongue and inhales]

16:35.559 --> 16:38.040
YOU KNOW HOW SOME CERTAIN
LITTLE RANDOM

16:38.084 --> 16:40.564
CHILDHOOD MEMORIES
STICK WITH YOU FOREVER?

16:40.608 --> 16:42.305
YOU KNOW, AND OFTENTIMES
THEY'RE ASSOCIATED

16:42.349 --> 16:44.307
WITH A PIECE OF MUSIC
OR A SONG?

16:44.351 --> 16:45.961
SURE. YOU KNOW THAT SONG

16:46.005 --> 16:47.963
ABOUT THE CAKE BEING
LEFT OUT IN THE RAIN?

16:48.007 --> 16:50.313
I ALWAYS SEE MY MOTHER
FEEDING PIGEONS.

16:50.357 --> 16:51.923
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.969
WHENEVER I THINK OF
HAPPY TIMES IN MY CHILDHOOD,

16:54.013 --> 16:56.624
I SEE A CERTAIN IMAGE.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.931
IT'S--IT'S A FOURTH OF JULY
PICNIC. UH...

16:59.975 --> 17:01.933
["Something's Gotten Hold
of My Heart" playing]YOU KNOW,
I'M ABOUT 12 OR SO,

17:01.977 --> 17:03.544
AND THERE'S MUSIC PLAYING.

17:03.587 --> 17:06.982
THERE'S A... A YOUNG GIRL
LAUGHING

17:07.026 --> 17:09.941
AS SHE'S BEING LIFTED INTO
THE AIR BY HER FATHER.

17:09.985 --> 17:11.421
EILEEN BARLOW.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.119
WELL, PEOPLE CALLED HER
LEELEE BACK THEN.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.338
UH...

17:15.382 --> 17:18.037
I DON'T THINK I EVER
SAW HER AGAIN AFTER THAT DAY.

17:19.864 --> 17:22.519
SHE'S JUST A MEMORY
THAT MADE ME SMILE.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.654
AND RED JOHN KILLED HER.

17:29.396 --> 17:32.268
I... I-IT'S LIKE HE JUST
REACHED INTO MY HEAD

17:32.312 --> 17:34.531
AND KILLED A HAPPY MEMORY.

17:46.456 --> 17:48.154
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE?

17:48.197 --> 17:50.025
HOW COULD HE READ YOUR MIND?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.331
I DON'T KNOW.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.075
HELL OF A TRICK, THOUGH,
RIGHT?

17:56.118 --> 17:59.513
IT'S A COINCIDENCE.
IT MUST BE.

17:59.556 --> 18:02.037
YEAH. YEAH, IT MUST BE.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.517
UH, COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

18:03.560 --> 18:05.388
COULD WAIT IN THE CAR
WHEN I TALK TO PETE?

18:05.432 --> 18:07.042
OKAY.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.435
IT'S NOT THAT HE DISLIKES YOU.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.132
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE...

18:10.176 --> 18:11.568
YOU'RE POLICE.

18:12.874 --> 18:14.702
I UNDERSTAND.

18:14.745 --> 18:16.791
THANK YOU.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.185
[fire crackling,
crickets chirping]

18:19.228 --> 18:21.012
WHAT?YOU KNOW WHAT.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.537
[vehicle approaching]SO YOU SAY.

18:23.580 --> 18:26.192
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
EILEEN WAS A BARLOW?

18:26.235 --> 18:27.410
YOU DIDN'T ASK ME.

18:27.454 --> 18:30.413
YOU THINK SEAN BARLOW
WAS BEHIND HER MURDER.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.328
AND YOU'RE AS CALM AS YOU ARE
ABOUT CAITLYN

18:32.372 --> 18:34.939
BECAUSE YOU ASSUME THE BARLOWS
ARE GONNA TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.202
IS THAT SO?

18:36.245 --> 18:38.160
AND YOU'RE JUST WAITING
FOR ME AND THE COPS

18:38.204 --> 18:40.031
TO MOVE ON,
THEN YOU AND RODDY

18:40.075 --> 18:42.077
ARE GONNA TAKE CARE
OF THIS YOURSELVES.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.818
NO.

18:43.861 --> 18:47.952
THE ONLY THING
I DON'T KNOW IS WHY.

18:47.996 --> 18:50.216
WHY WOULD YOU THINK
THAT SEAN BARLOW

18:50.259 --> 18:51.652
WOULD KILL HIS OWN NIECE?

18:51.695 --> 18:54.133
IT'S YOUR THEORY, NOT MINE.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.570
NO. IT'S YOURS.

18:56.613 --> 18:57.701
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY WRONG.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.573
THIS MURDER WAS DONE
BY RED JOHN.

18:59.616 --> 19:03.098
I MEAN, SEAN BARLOW
MAY HAVE HELPED HIM...

19:03.142 --> 19:05.144
BUT IF HE DID,
AND YOU KNOW HE DID,

19:05.187 --> 19:07.058
YOU BETTER TELL ME WHY
RIGHT NOW.

19:07.102 --> 19:08.451
LIKE I SAID--

19:08.495 --> 19:11.237
DON'T YOU EVEN TRY
TO LIE TO ME.

19:15.284 --> 19:18.418
SEAN BARLOW HAS ALWAYS
HATED RODDY.

19:18.461 --> 19:22.161
HE FORBADE EILEEN TO SEE HIM,
BUT SHE DID ANYHOW.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.162
WHY DOES HE HATE RODDY?

19:23.205 --> 19:25.512
[sniffles]
THE TRAVEL CIRCUIT

19:25.555 --> 19:29.211
IN BRITAIN AND IRELAND
IS A TOUGH GO.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.561
AND RODDY USED TO BE
A LITTLE SALTY.

19:31.605 --> 19:34.912
USED TO BE.
HE'S A CALMER FELLOW NOW.

19:34.956 --> 19:38.829
BUT HE BROKE SOME FACES
HE SHOULD HAVE LEFT ALONE.

19:38.873 --> 19:40.744
HE WAS ONE STEP
AHEAD OF TROUBLE

19:40.788 --> 19:43.225
WHEN MY SISTER SENT HIM
OVER HERE TO ME.

19:43.269 --> 19:46.924
ANYHOW, SOME OF
THE INJURED PARTIES

19:46.968 --> 19:49.275
WERE COUSINS TO THE BARLOWS,

19:49.318 --> 19:53.235
AND SEAN BARLOW LOVES
TO CULTIVATE A GRUDGE.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.716
GRUDGE ENOUGH TO MURDER
HIS OWN NIECE?

19:55.759 --> 19:59.937
YOU DON'T KNOW SEAN BARLOW.
[chuckles]

19:59.981 --> 20:03.202
HE DISOWNED EILEEN,
CALLED HER A WHORE.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.508
HE DEMANDED MONEY
FROM RODDY

20:05.552 --> 20:09.425
FOR PAYMENT
FOR LOST BARLOW PROPERTY.

20:09.469 --> 20:10.948
RODDY REFUSED, OF COURSE,

20:10.992 --> 20:13.386
AND SEAN ACCUSED HIM
OF THEFT

20:13.429 --> 20:14.996
AND SWORE VENGEANCE.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.391
SWORE VENGEANCE?

20:18.434 --> 20:20.828
IN A MANNER OF WORDS, YEAH.

20:20.871 --> 20:23.831
AND WHAT'S HIS CONNECTION
TO RED JOHN?

20:23.874 --> 20:25.180
IT DOESN'T QUITE FIT.

20:25.224 --> 20:29.924
SEAN BARLOW IS A SINISTER
PIECE OF WORK.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.622
HE'S MEAN AND CLEVER.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.581
HELL, PATTY...

20:34.624 --> 20:39.325
FOR ALL I KNOW, SEAN BARLOW
MAY BERED JOHN.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.329
GIVE ME AN ADDRESS.

21:00.302 --> 21:02.261
[indistinct conversations]

21:07.266 --> 21:10.312
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY WAIT HERE.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.009
NOT A CHANCE IN HELL.

21:12.053 --> 21:13.359
UH, HE'S OLD SCHOOL
LIKE PETE.

21:13.402 --> 21:15.012
HE'S NOT GONNA WANT TO TALK
TO A COP.

21:15.056 --> 21:16.231
WE'LL SEE.
I'M OLD SCHOOL, TOO.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.320
SERIOUSLY.SERIOUSLY!

21:18.364 --> 21:20.191
I DIDN'T COME HERE
ALL THE WAY FROM SACRAMENTO

21:20.235 --> 21:22.281
TO WAIT OUTSIDE.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.472
[inhales and exhales
deeply]

21:39.515 --> 21:41.604
[in foreign accent]
WELCOME, WELCOME.

21:41.648 --> 21:44.041
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.
I'M MARTA.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.434
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

21:45.478 --> 21:47.393
RELAX, SISTER,
WE'RE NOT CHUMPS.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.003
SHE'S A COP,
AND I'M IN ON THE GAG.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.831
[without accent]
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

21:50.874 --> 21:52.354
TO TALK TO SEAN BARLOW.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.051
THERE'S NO SEAN BARLOW HERE.

21:54.095 --> 21:56.837
[scoffs] SHE'S ALMOST AS BAD
A LIAR AS YOU ARE.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.665
YOU TELL SEAN--
WHO ISN'T HERE--

21:58.708 --> 22:01.276
THAT PATRICK JANE ISHERE,
AND HE'D LIKE TO TALK TO HIM.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.799
WE'LL WAIT.

22:09.458 --> 22:13.375
PATRICK JANE. IT IS YOU.
I DIDN'T BELIEVE HER!

22:13.419 --> 22:14.898
HELLO, MR. BARLOW.

22:14.942 --> 22:18.075
OH... CALL ME SEAN,
MY BOY--SEAN.

22:18.119 --> 22:21.340
WELL, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
SINCE YOU WERE, WHAT? 15?

22:21.383 --> 22:23.124
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

22:23.167 --> 22:25.431
AND YOU'VE BROUGHT
A POLICEWOMAN WITH YOU.

22:25.474 --> 22:27.302
GREAT PLEASURE TO MEET YOU,
YOUNG LADY.

22:27.346 --> 22:30.392
COME ON UPSTAIRS
AND LET'S CATCH UP.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.307
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING
YOUR DOINGS, PATRICK.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.396
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.791
WELL, OF COURSE YOU DO.[laughs]

22:37.834 --> 22:40.141
MY GRANDFATHER CAME OVER
FROM IRELAND

22:40.184 --> 22:42.796
WITH THIS ONE'S
GREAT GRANDFATHER.

22:42.839 --> 22:44.537
HIS FATHER AND I
WERE GREAT FRIENDS.

22:44.580 --> 22:47.627
HE WAS A WICKED MAN,
BUT I LOVED HIM.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.280
A WICKED MAN?

22:49.324 --> 22:51.326
YOU'RE A SPIRITUAL PERSON,
AREN'T YOU, TERESA?

22:51.370 --> 22:53.110
YOU BELIEVE IN LIFE
AFTER DEATH?

22:53.154 --> 22:54.503
YES.THEN YOU'LL AGREE

22:54.547 --> 22:57.201
IT'S A SAD THING TO BE
AN UNBELIEVER,

22:57.245 --> 22:59.552
TO HAVE NO FAITH.YES.

22:59.595 --> 23:03.077
AND WHEN FAITHLESS MEN
USE THE FAITH AND BELIEF

23:03.120 --> 23:05.340
OF OTHERS TO STEAL FROM THEM
WITH LIES,

23:05.384 --> 23:07.342
LIKE THE JANES DO,

23:07.386 --> 23:08.604
THAT'S SAD ANDWICKED.

23:08.648 --> 23:11.955
I AGREE.
I DON'T DO IT ANYMORE.

23:11.999 --> 23:14.610
[chuckles] NO.
A LAWMAN NOW.

23:14.654 --> 23:17.134
IT'S ATONEMENT YOU'RE AFTER,
IS IT?

23:17.178 --> 23:19.310
WELL, THE JANES NEVER
PRETENDED TO HAVE POWERS,

23:19.354 --> 23:21.008
ESPECIALLY WITH PEOPLE
IN THE SHOW,

23:21.051 --> 23:24.403
BUT, UH, THE BARLOWS
ALWAYS TRIED

23:24.446 --> 23:28.232
TO PASS THEMSELVES OFF
AS "REAL" PSYCHICS.MM.

23:28.276 --> 23:29.451
BECAUSE WE ARE.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.801
WELL, YOU SAID YOU KNEW
WHY WE WERE HERE.

23:31.845 --> 23:34.456
YEAH, IT WAS ON THE NEWS.

23:34.500 --> 23:35.936
EILEEN IS DEAD, MURDERED.

23:35.979 --> 23:38.025
YOU DON'T SEEM SO UPSET
ABOUT IT.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.461
SHE WAS ALREADY DEAD TO ME

23:39.505 --> 23:41.463
WHEN SHE LEFT THE FAMILY
FOR THAT SCUM.

23:41.507 --> 23:44.379
I MOURNED HER PASSING
LONG AGO.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.076
I WANT THE BABY, THOUGH.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.035
SHE'LL BE RAISED A BARLOW.

23:48.078 --> 23:49.602
WHERE WERE YOU THE NIGHT
BEFORE LAST?

23:49.645 --> 23:53.257
OH, I WAS FAR AWAY,
COMMUNING WITH THE SPIRITS.

23:53.301 --> 23:55.390
WHERE WERE YOU?

23:55.434 --> 23:56.652
LET ME SEE.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.049
LYING IN BED,
THINKING OF PATRICK.

24:02.092 --> 24:04.443
YOU'RE A LITTLE IN LOVE
WITH HIM, EH?

24:04.486 --> 24:07.446
BUT HE'S SO SECRETIVE
AND CONTROLLING.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.535
THAT'S HARD, ISN'T IT?

24:09.578 --> 24:10.666
[exhales]

24:10.710 --> 24:12.712
WE'RE HERE
BECAUSE OF EILEEN.

24:12.755 --> 24:16.542
IT WAS THAT SCUM RODDY TURNER
KILLED HER, NO DOUBT.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.500
WELL, RODDY AND HIS UNCLE
SAY IT WAS YOU.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.720
[laughs] WORDS ARE CHEAP.

24:20.763 --> 24:23.810
IT WAS RODDY SHE WAS AFRAID OF,
WASN'T IT?

24:23.853 --> 24:26.508
IT WAS HIM,
AND GOD KNOWS HE'LL PAY.

24:26.552 --> 24:29.424
WELL, WHOEVER KILLED EILEEN
AND TOOK CAITLYN,

24:29.468 --> 24:30.860
THEY HAD HELP
FROM RED JOHN,

24:30.904 --> 24:33.428
AND YOU'RE MORE
THE RED JOHN TYPE OF MAN.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.343
RED JOHN.

24:35.386 --> 24:37.563
ANY PUNK KILLER
WHO WANTS TO FOOL WITH YOU

24:37.606 --> 24:39.521
CAN PAINT A SMILEY FACE
ON THE WALL.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.523
[spooky voice]
"OOH, IT'S RED JOHN!"

24:41.567 --> 24:43.177
IT WAS RED JOHN.

24:43.220 --> 24:46.006
[normal voice] RED JOHN HAS
YOUR MIND COMPLETELY MESSED UP.

24:46.049 --> 24:48.617
YOU SEE HIM EVERY PLACE
YOU LOOK.

24:48.661 --> 24:52.099
YOU THINK YOU'RE GETTING CLOSER,
BUT HE IS JUST PLAYING WITH YOU.

24:52.142 --> 24:54.405
WE'LL SEE.HAS IT NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU

24:54.449 --> 24:58.453
TO ASK EXACTLY HOW RED JOHN IS
ALWAYS ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOU?

24:58.497 --> 25:00.499
HOW IS IT HE SEEMS
TO READ YOUR MIND?

25:00.542 --> 25:03.153
YOU TELL ME.RED JOHN'S GOT POWERS.

25:03.197 --> 25:06.635
REAL PSYCHIC POWERS
THAT YOU REFUSE TO BELIEVE IN.

25:06.679 --> 25:08.419
TERESA WILL HEAR
WHAT I'M SAYING,

25:08.463 --> 25:10.247
BUT YOU'VE NO FAITH,

25:10.291 --> 25:11.684
SO YOU'RE DEAF
TO THE TRUTH.

25:11.727 --> 25:14.251
HE'S GOT POWERS.

25:14.295 --> 25:16.253
THAT'S WHY HE'LL ALWAYS
DEFEAT YOU.

25:16.297 --> 25:18.125
SO I TAKE IT YOU HAVE
NO ALIBI

25:18.168 --> 25:21.084
FOR THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST.NO.

25:21.128 --> 25:22.564
NO, I DON'T.

25:22.608 --> 25:25.480
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,
MR. BARLOW.

25:25.524 --> 25:27.743
ENTIRELY MY PLEASURE.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.092
IT'S ODD, ISN'T IT,

25:29.136 --> 25:30.572
HOW THE DAUGHTERS
OF ALCOHOLICS

25:30.616 --> 25:33.009
SO OFTEN ARE THE BEST
KIND OF WOMEN.

25:33.053 --> 25:35.316
[breathes sharply]

25:35.359 --> 25:37.100
WHEN YOU FIND THE BABY,
BRING HER TO ME.

25:37.144 --> 25:38.493
SHE'LL BE WELL LOOKED AFTER.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.799
THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS.

25:39.842 --> 25:41.322
OH, DOES IT NOT?

25:41.365 --> 25:44.020
I'M SURE WE'LL SORT
SOMETHING OUT.

25:45.239 --> 25:47.328
THINK ON WHAT I SAID.

25:47.371 --> 25:49.635
IT'S HONEST ADVICE
FROM A FRIEND.

25:49.678 --> 25:52.159
GOOD SEEING YOU, SEAN.

25:52.202 --> 25:54.117
[indistinct conversations][breathing sharply]

25:54.161 --> 25:56.467
WOW. [sighs]
THAT WAS INTENSE.

25:56.511 --> 25:58.600
[inhales deeply]YOU OKAY?

25:58.644 --> 26:01.124
OH, I'M FINE. YOU OKAY?
HE DIDN'T SPOOK YOU, DID HE?

26:01.168 --> 26:02.648
YEAH. HE DIDN'T SPOOK YOU?

26:02.691 --> 26:06.390
AH, HE'S A GOOD SHOWMAN.
I'LL GIVE HIM THAT.

26:06.434 --> 26:08.567
AHH... I COULDN'T READ HIM.

26:08.610 --> 26:12.135
HE MIGHT HAVE KILLED EILEEN,
OR... HE MIGHT BE RIGHT.

26:12.179 --> 26:15.356
MAYBE HE BELIEVES
THAT RODDY DID DO IT.

26:15.399 --> 26:16.923
OR...

26:16.966 --> 26:19.142
MAYBE I'VE JUST FALLEN
FOR SOME PUNK

26:19.186 --> 26:20.535
PLAYING A TRICK.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.015
WHAT IF HE'S RIGHT?

26:22.058 --> 26:23.973
WHAT IF RED JOHN REALLY
DOES HAVE POWERS?

26:24.017 --> 26:25.584
PLEASE.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.542
A-AND WHAT IF DOLPHINS
WERE ACTUALLY ALIENS

26:27.586 --> 26:29.588
FROM ANOTHER GALAXY?
THAT WOULD BE KIND OF COOL.

26:29.631 --> 26:32.199
I'M SERIOUS. HOW DID
RED JOHN DO WHAT HE DID?

26:32.242 --> 26:33.592
HE READ YOUR MIND.

26:33.635 --> 26:37.117
IT WAS A COOL TRICK,
JUST LIKE I SAID.

26:42.426 --> 26:44.385
THIS WOMAN--SANDRA GUZMAN--
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?

26:44.428 --> 26:46.343
SHE JUST GOT ON THE BUS.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.004
[horn honks]

26:56.876 --> 26:58.312
[siren wails]

27:00.357 --> 27:03.273
[tires screech]

27:05.014 --> 27:06.712
[horn honks, tires screeching]

27:08.670 --> 27:09.932
[siren wailing]

27:09.976 --> 27:12.500
[horn honks, tires screeching]

27:15.808 --> 27:19.028
[horns honking]

27:21.727 --> 27:23.772
[siren wailing]

27:23.816 --> 27:27.950
[tires screech]

27:27.994 --> 27:29.691
[panting]

27:29.735 --> 27:31.737
[Rigsby] CBI!

27:32.607 --> 27:36.742
[panting]

27:36.785 --> 27:39.919
[gasps]HEY, SANDRA.

27:39.962 --> 27:43.705
WHY HAVE YOU BEEN RUNNING
FROM US, SANDRA?

27:43.749 --> 27:45.925
WE JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW AT THE MOTEL.

27:45.968 --> 27:49.668
DID YOU SEE IN THAT ROOM?
THAT WAS THE DEVIL IN THERE.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.582
I DON'T WANT NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT. I DON'T WANT...

27:51.626 --> 27:53.062
[filtered voice] TO TALK ABOUT IT.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.716
I JUST WANT TO FORGET
I EVER SAW IT.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.892
AND HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT
FOR YOU?

27:56.936 --> 27:58.807
NOT SO GOOD.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.679
I CAN'T SLEEP.

28:00.722 --> 28:04.552
EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES,
I SEE THAT POOR WOMAN.

28:04.595 --> 28:05.988
SO MAYBE YOU DO NEED
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

28:06.032 --> 28:07.816
[sighs]

28:07.860 --> 28:10.689
TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW
WHEN YOU WALKED INTO THE ROOM.[sniffles]

28:10.732 --> 28:12.778
I WAS...

28:12.821 --> 28:14.780
I WAS PULLING MY CART IN,

28:14.823 --> 28:17.608
SO I DIDN'T SEE THE BED
RIGHT AWAY.

28:17.652 --> 28:20.133
A-AND I WAS THINKING
SHE MOVED OUT,

28:20.176 --> 28:22.570
BECAUSE BEFORE, WHEN I DID THE ROOM,

28:22.613 --> 28:25.268
SHE HAD, LIKE, STACKS OF DIAPERS AND BABY MILK.

28:25.312 --> 28:27.009
BUT IT WAS ALL GONE.

28:27.053 --> 28:29.011
SO I THOUGHT THEY LEFT.

28:29.055 --> 28:31.405
AND THEN I TURN AROUND,

28:31.448 --> 28:34.756
LOOK AT THE BED,
AND, OH, MY GOD.

28:34.800 --> 28:38.673
HER EYES WERE OPEN,
LOOKING RIGHT AT ME.

28:40.022 --> 28:42.633
I FELL DOWN,
I WAS SO SCARED.

28:42.677 --> 28:44.070
[sniffles]

28:44.113 --> 28:47.900
THE CARPET WAS ALL WET
WITH HER BLOOD.

28:47.943 --> 28:49.728
[exhales]

28:49.771 --> 28:51.294
AND WHEN YOU ARRIVED
FOR WORK THAT MORNING,

28:51.338 --> 28:53.688
DID YOU NOTICE ANY STRANGERS?
ANYBODY ACTING WEIRD?

28:53.732 --> 28:55.603
ANYTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY?

28:55.646 --> 28:57.126
NOTHING.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.302
[gasps softly]

28:59.346 --> 29:00.869
UM...[sighs]

29:00.913 --> 29:03.437
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BABY?

29:04.568 --> 29:05.744
WE DON'T KNOW YET.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.746
[exhales]

29:09.878 --> 29:11.445
THE MOTEL MAID--
BLAMELESS.

29:11.488 --> 29:13.839
BUT ILLUMINATING. WE NEED
TO GO BACK TO CARSON SPRINGS,

29:13.882 --> 29:16.842
BUT FIRST, YOU NEED TO LET
RODDY TURNER GO.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.844
OKAY.

29:18.887 --> 29:21.194
THANK YOU.[clicks mouse]

29:21.237 --> 29:23.457
[Patrick] OKAY, SO WE HAVE
TWO PRIME SUSPECTS.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.763
RODDY TURNER--
EILEEN'S HUSBAND--

29:24.806 --> 29:26.677
AND SEAN BARLOW--
HER UNCLE.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.941
BOTH MEN ARE POINTING AT EACH
OTHER AS THE GUILTY PARTY.

29:28.984 --> 29:31.117
WE NEED YOUR HELP
TO FIND OUT WHICH ONE

29:31.160 --> 29:32.814
IS IN FACT THE KILLER.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.337
UH...UH, D-DON'T WORRY.

29:34.381 --> 29:35.904
THERE'LL BE NO DANGER.

29:35.948 --> 29:38.994
OH, I-I DON'T MIND THAT.
WHAT'S THE PLAN EXACTLY?

29:39.038 --> 29:41.170
WE'RE GONNA LET BOTH MEN KNOW
THAT THERE IS A BABY--
