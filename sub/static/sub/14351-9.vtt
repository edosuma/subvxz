00:24.304 --> 00:27.705
[Kirk] Captain's Log,
star date, 5693.2.

00:27.774 --> 00:28.968
The Enterprise
is approaching

00:29.042 --> 00:30.270
the last reported position

00:30.344 --> 00:31.777
of the star ship Defiant,

00:31.845 --> 00:34.780
which vanished without trace
three weeks ago.

00:34.848 --> 00:37.316
We are in
unsurveyed territory.

00:38.618 --> 00:40.984
Captain, we are registering
very curious readings

00:41.054 --> 00:42.487
from all sensors.

00:42.556 --> 00:43.648
Specify.

00:43.724 --> 00:44.816
I cannot.

00:44.891 --> 00:46.324
According to our
instruments,

00:46.393 --> 00:48.327
space itself is
literally breaking up.

00:48.395 --> 00:49.828
There is no
known phenomenon

00:49.896 --> 00:52.330
which would account
for these readings.

00:52.399 --> 00:53.696
What about
sensor failure?

00:53.767 --> 00:56.600
Negative. I've run
a complete check on all systems.

00:56.670 --> 00:59.366
Captain, we're losing power
in the warp engines!

00:59.439 --> 01:00.497
How bad?

01:00.574 --> 01:03.441
We can barely read it,
but I don't like it.

01:03.510 --> 01:05.569
I cannot find
the cause.

01:05.645 --> 01:06.737
[Chekov]
Captain.

01:08.515 --> 01:11.609
Visual detection
of an object dead ahead.

01:21.528 --> 01:22.825
How about it, Spock?

01:22.896 --> 01:24.158
Fascinating.

01:24.231 --> 01:25.220
Explain.

01:25.298 --> 01:27.732
There is virtually
no sensor contact.

01:27.801 --> 01:30.770
No mass analysis.
No trace of radiation.

01:30.837 --> 01:34.637
We see it, but our sensors
indicate it is not there.

01:45.752 --> 01:46.684
The Defiant.

01:54.060 --> 01:55.994
Mr. Sulu,
impulse engines only.

01:56.062 --> 01:57.495
Close to transporter range.

01:57.564 --> 01:58.997
Aye, aye, sir.

01:59.065 --> 02:00.930
Lieutenant, open up
a hailing frequency.

02:01.001 --> 02:02.935
I've been trying
to raise them.

02:03.003 --> 02:03.935
No response.

02:08.741 --> 02:10.675
Just within
transporter range, sir.

02:10.744 --> 02:13.008
Good.
Maintain position.

02:13.079 --> 02:16.014
Mr. Spock, Mr. Chekov,
come with me.

02:16.082 --> 02:19.017
Dr. McCoy, report to the
transporter room immediately.

02:19.085 --> 02:22.179
- Scotty, you have the con.
- Aye, sir.

02:42.542 --> 02:45.136
Locked in on
the Defiant bridge, sir.

02:45.212 --> 02:46.144
Energize.

03:24.684 --> 03:27.414
Space--
the final frontier.

03:33.527 --> 03:36.963
These are the voyages
of the star ship Enterprise.

03:37.030 --> 03:38.463
Its five-year mission--

03:38.532 --> 03:42.093
to explore
strange new worlds...

03:42.168 --> 03:45.968
to seek out new life
and new civilizations ...

03:46.039 --> 03:49.475
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.

04:44.030 --> 04:47.966
Has there ever been a mutiny
on a star ship before?

04:48.034 --> 04:51.026
Absolutely no record
of such an occurrence, Ensign.

05:05.485 --> 05:06.543
Jim.

05:07.621 --> 05:10.419
The captain's neck
is broken.

05:22.002 --> 05:23.936
The ship is still
functioning, Captain.

05:24.004 --> 05:26.939
It is logical to assume the
mutineers are somewhere aboard.

05:27.007 --> 05:29.441
Use the ship's sensors
to locate them.

05:29.509 --> 05:30.942
Kirk to Enterprise.

05:31.011 --> 05:32.444
Scott here, sir.

05:32.512 --> 05:36.448
Prepare to beam over
a full security squad on my orders.

05:36.516 --> 05:37.949
Aye, aye, Captain.

05:38.018 --> 05:41.454
Captain, there's no sign
of life aboard this vessel.

05:42.856 --> 05:45.256
Odd, Mr. Spock.
Very odd.

05:46.359 --> 05:48.793
Spock, you stay here
with me.

05:48.862 --> 05:52.298
Chekov, get down to engineering
and life support systems.

05:52.365 --> 05:55.459
Dr. McCoy, check out
the sick bay.

05:56.870 --> 05:59.805
Kirk to Enterprise.
Cancel the security squad

05:59.873 --> 06:03.240
and stand by
for further instructions.

06:03.309 --> 06:04.537
Aye, aye, Captain.

06:04.611 --> 06:05.703
Standing by.

06:05.779 --> 06:07.713
I can't get
an accurate fix

06:07.781 --> 06:09.214
on the Defiant,
Mr. Scott,

06:09.282 --> 06:12.217
but I know
it's drifting away from us.

06:12.285 --> 06:15.277
Shall I correct
for range, sir?

06:17.457 --> 06:19.322
Aye, I think
you're right.

06:19.392 --> 06:22.327
Keep us within beaming range,
but not too close.

07:17.817 --> 07:18.909
[Beep]

07:18.985 --> 07:22.512
- Captain.
- Report, Mr. Chekov.

07:23.656 --> 07:27.114
Just like what I found
in life support.

07:28.495 --> 07:29.860
All dead.

07:31.998 --> 07:34.364
Get back up here.

08:03.563 --> 08:05.121
Kirk to McCoy.

08:05.198 --> 08:06.893
McCoy here.

08:06.966 --> 08:10.902
Bones, can you tell me
what they all died of?

08:10.970 --> 08:13.734
I'd say these people
killed each other.

08:13.807 --> 08:14.899
They what?

08:14.974 --> 08:16.407
You heard correctly, Jim.

08:16.476 --> 08:17.966
These people
killed each other.

08:18.044 --> 08:24.005
Could mental disease
have infected all of the crew?

08:24.083 --> 08:25.482
According to the ship 's log,
the medical surgeon down here

08:25.552 --> 08:28.817
didn't even know what
was going on.

08:28.888 --> 08:31.288
The best I can do is
get all the readings I can get

08:31.357 --> 08:34.815
and analyze them later.

08:48.508 --> 08:49.941
What the devil?

08:51.010 --> 08:53.035
[Kirk]
Bones, what is it?

08:56.482 --> 08:58.109
Bones, what is it?

08:59.485 --> 09:00.577
Answer me!

09:06.025 --> 09:07.287
Answer me!

09:07.360 --> 09:08.793
Jim, this ship
is dissolving.

09:08.862 --> 09:12.298
My hand just passed
through a man and a table.

09:12.365 --> 09:14.492
Get up here
on the double!

09:17.170 --> 09:18.603
Mr. Scott,
the Defiant,

09:18.671 --> 09:21.196
it's starting
to disappear.

09:26.579 --> 09:27.739
Bridge to transporter room!

09:29.482 --> 09:30.915
Transporter room,
O'Neil here.

09:30.984 --> 09:32.417
Got that transporter
working yet?

09:32.485 --> 09:33.975
No, sir. Not yet.

09:34.053 --> 09:37.989
Take over, Mr. Sulu.
I'll be in the transporter room.

09:38.057 --> 09:39.490
Aye, aye, sir.

09:45.031 --> 09:49.297
Captain, the Defiant's
sensors correspond

09:49.369 --> 09:50.666
with an extremely
high degree of correlation

09:50.737 --> 09:51.999
to those
of the Enterprise.

09:52.071 --> 09:52.969
You mean what happened
to the Defiant

09:53.039 --> 09:54.973
might be happening
to the Enterprise?

09:55.041 --> 09:56.133
Affirmative.

09:57.443 --> 09:58.876
Kirk to Enterprise.
Mr. Scott.

09:58.945 --> 10:00.037
Scott here.

10:00.113 --> 10:02.638
Mr. Scott, stand by
to beam us back.

10:04.951 --> 10:07.476
I can't, sir.
Not all at once.

10:07.553 --> 10:09.350
Why not?
What's happened?

10:09.422 --> 10:10.514
Everything!

10:10.590 --> 10:12.524
That ship you're in
is fading,

10:12.592 --> 10:15.459
and it's ripping
the innards out of this one.

10:15.528 --> 10:16.961
It's jamming
our transporter frequencies.

10:17.030 --> 10:18.463
I've only got
three working.

10:18.531 --> 10:20.465
I'm not sure
of those.

10:20.533 --> 10:23.468
One of you
has got to wait.

10:23.536 --> 10:26.562
Chekov, McCoy,
prepare for transportation.

10:26.639 --> 10:28.072
You, too, Spock.

10:28.141 --> 10:29.574
Request permission
to remain, Captain.

10:29.642 --> 10:32.076
I could be
completing the data.

10:32.145 --> 10:33.237
Request denied.

10:33.313 --> 10:34.746
Captain, there
is a chance---

10:34.814 --> 10:36.247
I know the chances.

10:36.316 --> 10:37.749
Mr. Spock,
don't argue.

10:37.817 --> 10:39.250
Get back with
the information.

10:39.319 --> 10:40.650
I'll be right there.

10:44.991 --> 10:47.050
Scotty, energize
transporter.

10:47.126 --> 10:48.218
Aye.

11:34.474 --> 11:35.600
Energize.

12:16.616 --> 12:17.878
It's gone.

12:19.318 --> 12:21.616
The Defiant
Just vanished.

12:36.969 --> 12:38.163
Anything?

12:40.540 --> 12:41.734
Negative.

12:41.808 --> 12:45.039
That's it.
I've done all I can.

12:45.111 --> 12:48.012
There's nothing out there
to grab and bring in.

12:48.081 --> 12:51.517
When that ship went,
it took the captain with it.

13:04.764 --> 13:06.994
[Digitized Voice]
Computer working.

13:07.066 --> 13:09.933
Compute the next period
of spatial interphase.

13:10.002 --> 13:14.405
Next interphase
2 hours, 12 minutes.

13:14.474 --> 13:17.910
2 hours
and 12 minutes?

13:17.977 --> 13:20.775
That power leak unbalanced
the ship and she's drifting.

13:20.847 --> 13:22.212
I can't hold her
in place that long.

13:22.281 --> 13:25.478
We must try. The fabric
of space is very weak here.

13:25.551 --> 13:26.984
If we disturb it,

13:27.053 --> 13:27.985
there'll be no chance

13:28.054 --> 13:30.420
of retrieving
the captain alive.

13:30.490 --> 13:32.856
I don't understand
what's so special

13:32.925 --> 13:35.018
about this region
of space.

13:36.762 --> 13:39.196
Well, picture it
this way, Mr. Chekov.

13:39.265 --> 13:40.698
We exist
in a universe

13:40.766 --> 13:43.200
which coexists
with a multitude of others

13:43.269 --> 13:45.169
in the same
physical space.

13:45.238 --> 13:47.172
At certain
brief periods of time,

13:47.240 --> 13:50.368
an area of their space
overlaps an area of ours.

13:50.443 --> 13:52.377
That is a time
of interphase,

13:52.445 --> 13:53.878
during which
we can connect

13:53.946 --> 13:55.709
with the Defiant's
universe.

13:55.781 --> 13:57.112
Mr. Spock?

13:58.251 --> 14:00.913
We will be able
to retrieve the captain

14:00.987 --> 14:02.352
at that time,
won't we?

14:02.421 --> 14:03.581
Yes.

14:03.656 --> 14:06.022
However, the dimensional
structure of each universe

14:06.092 --> 14:07.582
is totally dissimilar.

14:07.660 --> 14:09.787
Any use of power
disturbs it.

14:09.862 --> 14:11.796
If we are not
extremely careful,

14:11.864 --> 14:14.924
we shall lose the captain
and become trapped ourselves.

14:15.001 --> 14:16.229
I see.

14:16.302 --> 14:18.770
And die like him?

14:18.838 --> 14:20.032
Aah!

14:20.106 --> 14:22.233
Aah!

14:25.578 --> 14:28.342
Aah!

14:28.414 --> 14:29.346
Aah!

14:31.317 --> 14:32.648
[Voice Echoes]
Chekov!

14:32.718 --> 14:33.650
Aah!

14:33.719 --> 14:34.651
Chekov!

14:34.720 --> 14:36.847
- Aah!
- Chekov!

14:37.990 --> 14:39.924
Security guards
to the bridge.

14:39.992 --> 14:41.016
Aye, sir.

14:46.098 --> 14:47.531
What happened,
Mr. Spock?

14:47.600 --> 14:50.535
I was attempting
to explain to Mr. Chekov

14:50.603 --> 14:53.538
the nature of our problems
in this situation

14:53.606 --> 14:55.039
when he attacked.

14:55.107 --> 14:57.041
Did anyone notice
anything peculiar

14:57.109 --> 14:59.043
in his behaviour
before this?

14:59.111 --> 15:01.978
I think he had
several spasms of pain.

15:02.048 --> 15:04.983
Did he seem to be
getting hysterical?

15:05.051 --> 15:07.485
Doctor, he seemed more
angry than frightened.

15:07.553 --> 15:10.488
He had no cause
to be angry.

15:10.556 --> 15:11.989
Take Mr. Chekov
to sick bay.

15:12.058 --> 15:13.491
Put him
under restraint.

15:28.074 --> 15:29.507
Lieutenant Uhura
is correct.

15:29.575 --> 15:32.009
There was murderous fury
in Chekov.

15:32.078 --> 15:35.514
The same fury which was
evident in the Defiant.

15:35.581 --> 15:38.106
That's what
I was afraid of.

15:38.184 --> 15:41.119
Whatever drove the Defiant's
crew to murder each other

15:41.187 --> 15:42.711
could be communicable.

15:42.788 --> 15:46.224
Is there anything you need
to isolate the cause?

15:46.292 --> 15:47.384
Time.

15:48.594 --> 15:50.027
By the way,
Mr. Spock,

15:50.096 --> 15:52.030
it might be
a wise precaution

15:52.098 --> 15:54.032
to put some distance
between us

15:54.100 --> 15:55.397
and the Defiant.

15:55.468 --> 15:57.902
If we are to recover
the captain,

15:57.970 --> 15:59.403
we must not move.

15:59.472 --> 16:00.905
How long will that take?

16:00.973 --> 16:04.636
Approximately two hours
before the attempt can be made.

16:04.710 --> 16:09.079
Spock, are you sure
that Jim is still alive?

16:11.050 --> 16:12.483
If the captain
was caught

16:12.551 --> 16:13.984
in our
transporter beam

16:14.053 --> 16:15.486
when the Defiant
phased out,

16:15.554 --> 16:18.489
it's possible he was spared
the shock of transition

16:18.557 --> 16:19.649
and survived.

16:19.725 --> 16:22.660
However, if we are
to recover him,

16:22.728 --> 16:25.663
we must catch him
at the precise moment

16:25.731 --> 16:27.164
during the next
interphase,

16:27.233 --> 16:28.598
or he will die.

16:28.668 --> 16:31.034
There can be
no margin for error.

16:31.103 --> 16:32.536
His environmental unit

16:32.605 --> 16:34.038
can provide
breathable air

16:34.106 --> 16:36.233
for no more than
3.62 hours.

16:38.344 --> 16:40.278
Mr. Spock,
a vessel approaching

16:40.346 --> 16:41.938
on an intercept vector.

16:42.014 --> 16:43.447
Status, Mr. Sulu.

16:43.516 --> 16:44.949
Range--
200,000 kilometres.

16:45.017 --> 16:48.783
Velocity-- 0.51 "C."

16:53.592 --> 16:55.890
Lieutenant Uhura,
signal red alert.

16:55.961 --> 16:58.521
All decks,
go to red alert!

16:58.597 --> 17:00.030
[Alarm Sounds]

17:00.099 --> 17:01.225
Security patrol.
Will do.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.927
[Security Officers
Over P.A. System]

17:06.539 --> 17:08.632
Security patrol.
Will do.

17:08.708 --> 17:10.141
They've stopped dead, sir.

17:10.209 --> 17:13.041
Range-- 90,000 kilometres
and holding.

17:13.112 --> 17:14.271
Mr. Spock?

17:14.347 --> 17:15.814
I'm receiving
a visual signal.

17:15.881 --> 17:17.644
Transfer to main viewer.

17:17.717 --> 17:18.911
Aye, sir.

17:27.292 --> 17:28.851
I am Commander Loskene.

17:28.928 --> 17:30.361
You are trespassing

17:30.429 --> 17:33.364
in a territorial annex
of the Tholian Assembly.

17:33.432 --> 17:36.731
You must leave this area
immediately.

17:36.802 --> 17:39.737
Spock, in command of the
Federation star ship Enterprise.

17:39.805 --> 17:44.674
According to the Federation,
this area is free space.

17:44.744 --> 17:46.177
We claim this territory

17:46.245 --> 17:49.180
and are prepared
to use force, if necessary,

17:49.248 --> 17:50.875
to protect our property.

17:50.950 --> 17:53.475
We're not interested
in your display of force.

17:53.552 --> 17:56.487
The Enterprise
is responding to a distress signal

17:56.555 --> 17:57.988
from one of our ships

17:58.057 --> 17:59.957
and is currently engaged
in rescue operations.

18:00.025 --> 18:01.993
Do you wish
to assist us?

18:02.061 --> 18:05.326
I find no evidence
of a disabled ship.

18:05.398 --> 18:06.831
My instruments indicate

18:06.899 --> 18:09.925
ours are the only two
vessels in this area.

18:10.002 --> 18:12.436
The other ship is
interspatially trapped.

18:12.505 --> 18:16.202
It should reappear
in 1 hour and 53 minutes.

18:16.275 --> 18:19.210
We request
you stand by until then.

18:19.278 --> 18:20.711
Very well, Enterprise.

18:20.780 --> 18:23.214
In the interest
of interstellar amity,

18:23.282 --> 18:26.217
we will wait precisely
1 hour and 53 minutes,

18:26.285 --> 18:28.014
but be correct.

18:28.087 --> 18:31.454
We do not tolerate
deceit.

18:36.295 --> 18:39.662
If we could only find
the proper filtering agent,

18:39.732 --> 18:43.190
we might be able
to solve this problem.

18:43.269 --> 18:45.737
Negative.
It's the third failure.

18:48.107 --> 18:52.066
Nurse, take this sample
and run an analysis on it.

18:52.144 --> 18:53.236
Yes, Doctor.

18:58.317 --> 18:59.807
Bridge to transporter room.

18:59.885 --> 19:01.318
Transporter room here.

19:01.387 --> 19:04.322
Ready for interphase
in 20 seconds.

19:07.793 --> 19:08.725
Dr. McCoy!

19:36.288 --> 19:37.721
Thank you, nurse.

19:37.790 --> 19:38.882
Call security.

19:38.958 --> 19:41.859
I want to have
some checks run on this man.

19:41.927 --> 19:43.554
Lock on to Captain Kirk's
coordinates

19:43.629 --> 19:47.998
and prepare to bring him
aboard, Mr. Scott.

19:55.307 --> 19:57.468
Bring him aboard,
Mr. Scott.

19:57.543 --> 19:58.976
I'm trying.

19:59.044 --> 20:02.741
Captain Kirk is not on his designated
coordinates, Mr. Spock!

20:05.484 --> 20:08.180
Well, keep trying,
Mr. Scott.

20:09.355 --> 20:11.186
Lieutenant Sulu,
evaluation.

20:11.257 --> 20:13.191
Sensor readings
are not corresponding

20:13.259 --> 20:17.696
to those we received the last time
we saw the Defiant.

20:17.763 --> 20:20.698
It's possible that Tholian entry
into the area

20:20.766 --> 20:22.199
has disturbed the space,

20:22.268 --> 20:24.600
and if that
has occurred...

20:24.670 --> 20:27.264
McCoy to bridge.

20:27.339 --> 20:28.465
Spock here.

20:28.541 --> 20:30.975
Has the captain
been beamed aboard yet?

20:31.043 --> 20:32.135
Negative, Doctor.

20:32.211 --> 20:35.044
When is that interphase
going to happen?

20:35.114 --> 20:38.049
Theoretically it
already has happened, Doctor.

20:38.117 --> 20:41.052
However, the ship's sensors
are not responding as predicted.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.247
You had
the thing timed out.

20:43.322 --> 20:44.755
I did, Doctor.

20:44.823 --> 20:47.348
The space was disturbed
by the Tholians.

20:47.426 --> 20:50.361
You don't know whether
you'll recover the captain?

20:50.429 --> 20:51.657
Not at this interphase.

20:51.730 --> 20:53.163
I shall have
to recalculate

20:53.232 --> 20:55.666
to determine when
the next interphase occurs.

20:55.734 --> 20:58.202
They don't take place
at regular intervals.

20:58.270 --> 20:59.703
You can't wait.

20:59.772 --> 21:01.137
We've had another case
like Chekov.

21:01.206 --> 21:04.141
I've confined
my orderly to sickbay.

21:04.209 --> 21:07.645
I have confidence that you
will soon isolate the cause

21:07.713 --> 21:10.273
and prevent further spread
of the affliction.

21:10.349 --> 21:13.284
The disease is not
transmitted by the men,

21:13.352 --> 21:16.287
the cause is the area
of space we're in.

21:16.355 --> 21:18.186
It's affecting
the whole crew.

21:18.257 --> 21:20.691
The molecular structure
of the brain tissues

21:20.759 --> 21:23.785
in the central nervous system
are distorting.

21:23.862 --> 21:26.296
The madness that affected
the Defiant's crew

21:26.365 --> 21:28.162
will soon happen
to the Enterprise.

21:28.233 --> 21:31.566
You've got
to get this ship out of here!

21:31.637 --> 21:33.332
We're being
fired upon.

21:41.313 --> 21:42.746
The renowned
Tholian punctuality.

21:42.815 --> 21:45.750
Damage control report--
Minor structural damage

21:45.818 --> 21:48.753
to sections A-4 and C-13.

21:48.821 --> 21:50.254
Engineering,
hold power steady

21:50.322 --> 21:52.756
and cut off all
unnecessary expenditures.

21:52.825 --> 21:55.760
Mr. Sulu, divert all but
emergency maintenance power

21:55.828 --> 21:57.261
to the shields.

21:57.329 --> 22:00.992
Sir, that will reduce
our phaser power by 50%.

22:02.801 --> 22:04.132
Mr. Spock!

22:08.307 --> 22:09.672
Scott to bridge!

22:11.310 --> 22:12.402
Spock here.

22:12.478 --> 22:15.413
I know you don't like
to use the phasers,

22:15.481 --> 22:17.915
but you've got to do
something about that ship!

22:17.983 --> 22:19.245
Understood.

22:19.318 --> 22:22.185
Lieutenant Uhura, open
a channel to the Tholian ship.

22:22.254 --> 22:25.087
Mr. Sulu, lock in
phaser tracking controls.

22:25.157 --> 22:26.351
Phasers locked in,
sir.

22:26.425 --> 22:29.952
There's no response
on any frequency, sir.

22:30.029 --> 22:31.963
What's the use
of this battle?

22:32.031 --> 22:34.625
You've lost Jim.
Take us away.

22:34.700 --> 22:35.860
Ready, Mr. Sulu?

22:37.202 --> 22:38.134
Ready.

22:40.239 --> 22:42.002
Fire.

22:47.279 --> 22:48.246
A hit!

22:55.354 --> 22:57.185
Engineering,
status report.

22:58.857 --> 22:59.949
Mr. Scott--

23:00.025 --> 23:01.458
That hit
from the Tholians

23:01.527 --> 23:03.654
fused our power supply
converters.

23:03.729 --> 23:06.323
I can't do a thing
with the Enterprise.

23:06.398 --> 23:07.831
She's bound to drift,

23:07.900 --> 23:10.334
maybe right through
that doorway out there.

23:10.402 --> 23:13.769
Can you estimate minimum
time required for repair?

23:13.839 --> 23:16.774
I don't even know
if she can be repaired.

23:16.842 --> 23:18.207
Are you satisfied?

23:20.713 --> 23:22.578
Why did you do it?

23:22.648 --> 23:25.082
The decision to fight
was logical.

23:25.150 --> 23:28.085
Lack of time prevented
any other course of action.

23:28.153 --> 23:30.553
The Tholian ship
had to be disabled.

23:30.622 --> 23:33.056
You should've known
what could've happened

23:33.125 --> 23:35.059
and done everything
in your power

23:35.127 --> 23:36.560
to safeguard your crew,

23:36.628 --> 23:39.028
that's the mark of
a star ship captain, like Jim.

23:39.098 --> 23:42.033
I hardly believe this
is the time for comparisons.

23:42.101 --> 23:43.898
Please go
to your laboratory

23:43.969 --> 23:46.802
and search for an antidote
to the effects of this space.

23:46.872 --> 23:50.899
That's your primary task,
since we must remain here.

23:53.812 --> 23:54.904
Mr. Spock...

23:54.980 --> 23:56.845
something has
Just entered sensor range.

23:58.684 --> 24:00.117
It's another
Tholian, sir.

24:00.185 --> 24:01.482
Loskene must've
contacted them

24:01.553 --> 24:02.815
when trying
to intercept us.

24:02.888 --> 24:04.219
Fascinating.

24:04.289 --> 24:06.280
Lock in remaining
phaser power?

24:06.358 --> 24:07.791
Negative.
Lieutenant Uhura,

24:07.860 --> 24:10.294
open a channel
to the approaching vessel.

24:10.362 --> 24:11.727
They're refusing reception.
I can't--

24:11.797 --> 24:12.786
Distance, Mr. Sulu.

24:12.865 --> 24:14.389
Just beyond
phaser range, sir.

24:21.306 --> 24:22.466
What is that?

24:37.156 --> 24:41.092
Mr. Sulu, I shall run
an analysis on those filaments.

24:41.160 --> 24:45.096
Tie in all sensors to the
library computer console.

24:47.332 --> 24:48.856
Switch scanners.

24:48.934 --> 24:50.299
Yes, sir.

24:56.809 --> 24:59.243
There's no analogy
to this structure

24:59.311 --> 25:00.744
in Federation technology.

25:00.813 --> 25:03.179
It is, however,
an energy field,

25:03.248 --> 25:05.682
and if the Tholians
are successful

25:05.751 --> 25:07.184
in completing this structure

25:07.252 --> 25:10.688
before we have
completed our repairs...

25:10.756 --> 25:13.054
we shall not
see home again.

25:44.323 --> 25:46.757
Doctor, your last report
on an antidote

25:46.825 --> 25:49.760
on the effects
of this space was negative.

25:49.828 --> 25:51.261
It's still negative,
Mr. Spock.

25:51.330 --> 25:54.766
Tharagen is the most promising
substance tested so far.

25:54.833 --> 25:56.266
We're progressing.

25:56.335 --> 25:59.771
The urgency requires
your attention in the laboratory.

25:59.838 --> 26:02.705
My staff is working
around the clock.

26:02.774 --> 26:08.212
My being there will not affect
any of the tests.

26:08.280 --> 26:12.717
This service requires my personal
attention, Mr. Spock.

26:29.201 --> 26:31.726
A few hours ago,

26:31.803 --> 26:35.796
the captain elected to
remain on board the Defiant

26:35.874 --> 26:38.240
so that three members
of his crew

26:38.310 --> 26:39.743
would have the best chance

26:39.811 --> 26:41.938
of returning safely
to the Enterprise.

26:43.615 --> 26:46.550
His concern
was not only for them,

26:46.618 --> 26:50.452
but for all the members
of the crew of this ship.

26:52.824 --> 26:56.021
You all know
the sequence of events.

26:56.094 --> 26:58.688
You were fired upon
by the Tholian ship.

26:58.764 --> 27:00.561
At that time,

27:00.632 --> 27:04.295
Captain Kirk
may have been alive.

27:04.369 --> 27:07.998
I deemed it necessary
to return the Tholian fire

27:08.073 --> 27:11.042
for the safety
of the Enterprise.

27:11.109 --> 27:14.806
The Tholian ship
has been disabled.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.508
But as a result
of the battle,

27:17.582 --> 27:19.516
we must accept the fact

27:19.584 --> 27:23.850
that Captain Kirk
is no longer alive.

27:23.922 --> 27:26.015
Aah!

27:31.096 --> 27:32.825
Take him to sick bay.

27:32.898 --> 27:34.525
Put him in restraint.

27:52.617 --> 27:54.050
I shall not attempt

27:54.119 --> 27:57.054
to voice the quality
of respect and admiration

27:57.122 --> 27:59.556
which Captain Kirk
commanded.

27:59.624 --> 28:03.492
Each of you
must evaluate the loss

28:03.562 --> 28:06.463
in the privacy
of your own thoughts.

28:10.402 --> 28:11.369
Attention.

28:21.079 --> 28:22.876
Dismissed.

28:30.122 --> 28:32.113
There is a duty
to be performed

28:32.190 --> 28:33.521
in the captain's quarters,

28:33.592 --> 28:37.084
which requires
our presence.

28:37.162 --> 28:38.527
It can wait, Doctor.

28:38.597 --> 28:41.930
My duties require my immediate
presence on the bridge.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.025
The captain
left a message tape.

28:44.102 --> 28:46.536
It was his order that it be
reviewed by both of us,

28:46.605 --> 28:49.039
should he ever be
declared dead.

28:49.107 --> 28:51.302
You have just
declared Jim dead.

28:51.376 --> 28:54.038
It will wait for a more
suitable moment, Doctor.

28:54.112 --> 28:57.309
Why? Are you afraid it'll
change your present status?

28:57.382 --> 29:00.545
The mental and physical state
of this crew

29:00.619 --> 29:02.450
are your responsibility,
Doctor.

29:02.521 --> 29:05.490
At the moment, they
are your top priority.

29:05.557 --> 29:07.684
The captain's last order
is top priority,

29:07.759 --> 29:11.422
and you will honour that
order before you take over.

29:25.277 --> 29:27.006
He was a hero,

29:27.079 --> 29:30.014
yet his life
was sacrificed for nothing.

29:30.082 --> 29:32.516
What would have
given his death meaning

29:32.584 --> 29:34.518
is the safety
of the Enterprise.

29:34.586 --> 29:36.019
Now you've made that
impossible.

29:36.088 --> 29:38.181
We came here for
a specific purpose, Doctor.

29:38.256 --> 29:39.689
Maybe not the same one.

29:39.758 --> 29:43.785
I really came here to find out
why you stayed and fought.

29:43.862 --> 29:47.525
The captain would have remained
to recover a crew member

29:47.599 --> 29:50.033
at the risk of his own life
or even his own ship.

29:50.102 --> 29:51.535
Yes, he would,
Mr. Spock,

29:51.603 --> 29:54.037
but you didn't have
that decision to make.

29:54.106 --> 29:58.202
What would you gain
by fighting the Tholians?

29:58.276 --> 30:01.268
You could have assured
yourself of a captaincy

30:01.346 --> 30:03.837
by leaving the area.
But you chose to stay. Why?

30:05.617 --> 30:07.551
I need not explain
my rationale to you

30:07.619 --> 30:09.143
or any other member
of this crew.

30:09.221 --> 30:12.622
There is a margin of
variation in any experiment.

30:12.691 --> 30:14.716
While there was
a chance,

30:14.793 --> 30:16.852
I was bound
legally and morally

30:16.928 --> 30:18.361
to ascertain
the captain's status.

30:18.430 --> 30:22.958
You mean to be sure
if he was dead.

30:23.034 --> 30:25.798
Well, you made certain
of that.

30:25.871 --> 30:27.463
That is enough, Doctor.

30:27.539 --> 30:30.337
We both have
other things to do.

30:30.408 --> 30:32.103
Yes, I have
something to do.

30:33.445 --> 30:34.707
If the crew is to survive,

30:34.779 --> 30:36.940
I have to find
an antidote

30:37.015 --> 30:38.312
to this space
you've locked us into.

30:38.383 --> 30:40.078
You will return
to your duty

30:40.152 --> 30:43.087
as soon as we've discharged
our responsibilities here.

30:43.155 --> 30:44.520
There's no hurry,
Mr. Spock.

30:44.589 --> 30:47.080
The antidote probably
doesn't concern you.

30:47.159 --> 30:48.592
Vulcans
are probably immune,

30:48.660 --> 30:50.184
so just take your time.

30:55.667 --> 30:58.500
I must admit I don't
understand you, Spock,

30:58.570 --> 31:00.094
but I just can't believe

31:00.172 --> 31:02.106
that you would
want Jim's command.

31:02.174 --> 31:05.041
You must know that
if you get us out of this situation,

31:05.110 --> 31:06.543
they'll
pin a medal on you

31:06.611 --> 31:09.546
and give you command
of the Enterprise.

31:09.614 --> 31:14.313
Doctor, I am in command
of the Enterprise.

31:15.787 --> 31:18.085
I would like to
remedy that situation.

31:20.625 --> 31:22.217
[Beep]

31:22.294 --> 31:25.559
If you believe
I have acted irregularly,

31:25.630 --> 31:27.564
then relieve me of duty.

31:27.632 --> 31:31.068
That is your prerogative
as medical officer of this ship.

31:31.136 --> 31:33.070
Bones, Spock...

31:33.138 --> 31:35.072
since you are
playing this tape,

31:35.140 --> 31:37.074
we will assume
that I am dead,

31:37.142 --> 31:39.076
that the tactical situation
is critical,

31:39.144 --> 31:42.671
and both of you are locked
in mortal combat.

31:42.747 --> 31:45.580
It means, Spock, that you
have control of the ship

31:45.650 --> 31:47.117
and are probably making

31:47.185 --> 31:49.119
the most difficult decisions
of your career.

31:49.187 --> 31:53.089
I can offer only
one small piece of advice,

31:53.158 --> 31:54.750
for whatever
it's worth--

31:54.826 --> 31:59.092
Use every scrap of knowledge
and logic you have

31:59.164 --> 32:00.597
to save the ship.

32:00.665 --> 32:04.226
But tempery our judgment
with intuitive insight.

32:04.302 --> 32:07.601
I believe you have
those qualities,

32:07.672 --> 32:11.039
but if you can't
find them in yourself,

32:11.109 --> 32:13.100
seek out McCoy.

32:13.178 --> 32:15.544
Ask his advice.

32:15.614 --> 32:20.051
And if you find it sound,
take it.

32:20.118 --> 32:26.546
Bones, you've heard
what I've just told Spock.

32:26.625 --> 32:28.456
Help him if you can,

32:28.526 --> 32:30.858
but remember,
he is the captain.

32:30.929 --> 32:33.489
His decisions must be
followed without question.

32:33.565 --> 32:37.057
You might find that he is
capable of human insight

32:37.135 --> 32:39.069
and human error.

32:39.137 --> 32:41.571
They are most difficult
to defend,

32:41.640 --> 32:44.575
but you will find
that he is deserving

32:44.643 --> 32:48.579
of the same loyalty
and confidence

32:48.647 --> 32:51.411
each of you
have given me.

32:51.483 --> 32:54.077
Take care.

33:11.102 --> 33:13.536
Spock, l... uh...

33:13.605 --> 33:16.130
I'm sorry.

33:19.110 --> 33:21.044
It does hurt,
doesn't it?

33:23.114 --> 33:25.548
What would you
have me say, Doctor?

33:31.623 --> 33:33.557
[Intercom Whistle]

33:33.625 --> 33:35.058
Spock here.

33:35.126 --> 33:37.060
[Scotty] Mr. Spock,
we have a readout

33:37.128 --> 33:39.062
on the Tholian
tractor field.

33:39.130 --> 33:42.065
I think we can estimate its
approximate completion time.

33:42.133 --> 33:44.067
I shall be there
shortly.

33:45.637 --> 33:48.071
Doctor,
I believe we each have

33:48.139 --> 33:50.073
our respective tasks
to complete

33:50.141 --> 33:52.575
before the Tholians
complete theirs.

34:21.606 --> 34:22.538
Aah!

34:35.085 --> 34:37.110
Captain!

34:37.188 --> 34:39.018
Captain Kirk,
we thought you were--

34:53.638 --> 34:54.570
Spock!

34:54.639 --> 34:55.833
Mr. Sp--

34:58.643 --> 34:59.575
Oh, Doctor...

34:59.644 --> 35:01.703
I've just seen
the captain.

35:01.780 --> 35:04.248
Of course you have.
We'd all like to--

35:04.315 --> 35:05.714
He's alive.

35:05.784 --> 35:06.842
He's alive,
Doctor.

35:06.918 --> 35:08.442
Of course.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.715
Believe me,
I did see him.

35:10.789 --> 35:12.279
I did.

35:12.357 --> 35:13.654
Spock!

35:13.725 --> 35:15.215
Mr. Spock!

35:15.293 --> 35:17.227
You're going to sick bay.

35:17.295 --> 35:19.229
Doctor--

35:19.297 --> 35:22.232
Doctor,
I'm not going mad.

35:22.300 --> 35:25.235
I did see
Captain Kirk.

35:25.303 --> 35:27.237
I've got to get...

35:27.305 --> 35:29.739
to Mr. Spock.

36:03.775 --> 36:05.470
Scott to Captain.

36:05.543 --> 36:07.704
Scott to Captain.

36:09.280 --> 36:10.212
Spock here.

36:10.281 --> 36:12.374
Proceed, Mr. Scott.

36:12.450 --> 36:15.510
One of our crewmen
Just went berserk.

36:15.587 --> 36:18.818
Report all symptoms noted
prior to the attack.

36:18.890 --> 36:20.221
Spock out.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.734
[Groaning]

36:38.309 --> 36:40.641
- Dr. McCoy,
- Yes, Nurse.

36:40.712 --> 36:42.236
I have the diagnosis
of the crewman

36:42.313 --> 36:43.780
who attacked
engineer Scott.

36:43.848 --> 36:47.750
It was definitely due to
the effects of interspace.

36:47.819 --> 36:50.754
It's beginning to spread
throughout the ship.

36:50.822 --> 36:52.756
Are we any closer,
Doctor?

36:52.824 --> 36:54.257
No, except I'm positive

36:54.325 --> 36:57.260
that it's a tharagen derivative
that's the answer.

36:57.328 --> 37:00.058
And it better be
the next one.

37:08.773 --> 37:10.206
Aah!

37:12.277 --> 37:14.905
Aah!

37:14.979 --> 37:16.708
Uhh!

37:16.781 --> 37:18.214
Uhh!

37:20.285 --> 37:21.718
Aah!

37:31.796 --> 37:34.230
Mr. Spock didn't
believe me either,

37:34.299 --> 37:35.732
did he, Doctor?

37:35.800 --> 37:38.963
Well, nobody saw him
but you, Uhura.

37:39.037 --> 37:41.232
Then l...

37:41.306 --> 37:43.638
didn't really see him.

37:43.708 --> 37:44.640
Did l?

37:46.311 --> 37:47.903
I don't think so.

37:47.979 --> 37:51.107
Aah!

37:51.182 --> 37:54.242
Aah!

37:54.319 --> 37:57.117
Will I become
like Chekov, Doctor?

37:57.188 --> 37:58.746
No, no.

37:58.823 --> 38:00.757
We're working hard.

38:00.825 --> 38:02.986
We'll find an antidote.

38:03.061 --> 38:04.688
Aah!

38:14.272 --> 38:16.206
We're beginning
to interphase.

38:16.274 --> 38:17.707
I'm all right.

38:22.780 --> 38:24.213
Scott to bridge.

38:24.282 --> 38:25.715
Bridge. Spock here.

38:25.783 --> 38:27.375
Are we slipping
into interspace?

38:27.452 --> 38:30.353
Negative. We are relatively
stable at the moment.

38:30.421 --> 38:31.854
Why do you ask?

38:40.398 --> 38:43.196
I... don't believe it.

38:46.904 --> 38:48.064
What is it, Mr. Scott?

38:50.808 --> 38:52.742
Mr. Scott.

38:52.810 --> 38:55.745
Mr. Spock, I've just seen
Captain Kirk.

38:55.813 --> 38:59.010
He was standing there
as plain as we are,

38:59.083 --> 39:01.244
and then he
Just disappeared.

39:01.319 --> 39:04.186
Report to the bridge
immediately.

39:04.255 --> 39:06.189
Sounds like
a horror story.

39:06.257 --> 39:07.884
Any truth in it?

39:07.959 --> 39:09.187
In critical moments,

39:09.260 --> 39:12.058
men sometimes see exactly
what they wish to see.

39:12.130 --> 39:16.396
Are they seeing Jim because
they've lost confidence in you?

39:16.467 --> 39:18.992
I was merely stating
a fact, Doctor.

39:19.070 --> 39:20.128
It's getting critical.

39:20.204 --> 39:23.105
There have been assaults
on the lower decks.

39:23.174 --> 39:24.368
Even Scotty's
being affected.

39:24.442 --> 39:25.704
If Scotty goes under,

39:25.777 --> 39:28.712
we'll have no chance
of getting out of here.

39:28.780 --> 39:30.714
Please leave that
to me, Dr. McCoy.

39:30.782 --> 39:33.216
I realize that the crew
are your prime concern.

39:33.284 --> 39:35.218
You can best serve them
in your laboratory.

39:35.286 --> 39:36.719
Confine yourself to it

39:36.788 --> 39:38.722
until a remedy
has been found.

39:38.790 --> 39:40.348
Spock!

39:47.799 --> 39:51.235
Must be this space
is getting to me, too.

39:51.302 --> 39:54.032
I know it's nothing
you've done, Spock.

39:54.105 --> 39:56.232
I-- I'm sorry.

39:57.809 --> 39:59.242
I understand, Doctor.

39:59.310 --> 40:02.746
I'm sure the captain
would simply have said,

40:02.814 --> 40:04.748
"Forget it, Bones."

40:13.825 --> 40:16.350
Mr. Spock! Look!

40:27.038 --> 40:28.437
Captain?

40:42.987 --> 40:44.284
Captain?

40:55.867 --> 40:57.198
Captain?

41:29.901 --> 41:32.267
Am I all right, Doctor?

41:32.336 --> 41:33.963
Yes, Uhura, you're fine.

41:34.038 --> 41:35.938
Then what I saw--

41:36.007 --> 41:37.941
It was real.

41:38.009 --> 41:41.604
Captain Kirk's alive?

41:41.679 --> 41:42.941
We all saw him.

41:43.014 --> 41:44.447
The captain's
still alive.

41:44.515 --> 41:45.447
Ohh.

41:48.019 --> 41:49.452
[Intercom Whistle]

41:50.988 --> 41:53.513
Then your fears about
that phaser were correct.

41:53.591 --> 41:57.027
It blasted a hole right through
that crazy space fabric.

41:57.094 --> 41:59.528
Only heaven knows where
it sent the Defiant.

41:59.597 --> 42:01.531
Exactly.
But the captain remained.

42:01.599 --> 42:04.033
Only the overlap time
changed.

42:04.101 --> 42:06.968
The next interphase
will occur...

42:07.038 --> 42:08.528
here.

42:08.606 --> 42:10.039
Can you be ready?

42:10.107 --> 42:13.235
That'll be
about 20 minutes.

42:13.311 --> 42:14.642
She'll be
back together.

42:14.712 --> 42:16.805
We'll only have
80% power built up.

42:16.881 --> 42:19.145
It will have to do,
Mr. Scott.

42:19.217 --> 42:20.149
[Beep Beep]

42:20.218 --> 42:21.549
Come.

42:24.121 --> 42:26.055
What have you
got there?

42:26.123 --> 42:28.057
Compliments of the house.

42:28.125 --> 42:29.558
To your good health

42:29.627 --> 42:32.061
and the health
of the crew.

42:32.129 --> 42:33.562
You found the antidote,
Doctor.

42:33.631 --> 42:36.065
Yes. I've ordered it
orally or intravenously

42:36.133 --> 42:38.067
for everyone
aboard the ship.

42:38.135 --> 42:41.070
I would like
for you gentlemen

42:41.138 --> 42:42.571
to drink it down.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.767
Ensign Chekov
was affected so early.

42:44.842 --> 42:46.309
Has he responded to it?

42:46.377 --> 42:48.072
He's his
smiling self again.

42:48.145 --> 42:49.908
I've discharged him
from sick bay.

42:49.981 --> 42:51.471
What is it?

42:51.549 --> 42:53.414
It's a diluted
tharagen derivative.

42:53.484 --> 42:56.419
Tharagen -- a nerve gas
used by the Klingons.

42:56.487 --> 42:58.512
Aye!
And deadly, too.

42:58.589 --> 43:00.614
You're trying
to kill us all?

43:00.691 --> 43:04.684
It causes fatality
only when used in pure form.

43:04.762 --> 43:07.526
And in this derivative
mixed with alcohol,

43:07.598 --> 43:11.034
it merely deadens certain
nerve inputs to the brain.

43:11.102 --> 43:14.538
Well, any decent brand
of Scotch will do that.

43:14.605 --> 43:16.539
One good slug of this,

43:16.607 --> 43:19.041
and you can hit a man
with phaser stun,

43:19.110 --> 43:22.546
and he'd never feel it
or even know it.

43:26.117 --> 43:29.052
Does it make
a good mix with Scotch?

43:29.120 --> 43:30.553
It should.

43:30.621 --> 43:32.555
I'll let you know.

43:39.130 --> 43:41.564
Well, drink it down,
Spock.

43:41.632 --> 43:44.567
It's the human thing
to do.

43:44.635 --> 43:47.570
That's
a medical order...

43:47.638 --> 43:48.900
Captain.

44:00.851 --> 44:03.183
[Siren]

44:04.588 --> 44:06.021
Welcome back,
Lieutenant.

44:06.090 --> 44:07.523
Thank you, sir.

44:07.591 --> 44:10.025
Your absence was
keenly felt, Mr. Chekov.

44:10.094 --> 44:11.527
Thank you, Mr. Spock.

44:11.595 --> 44:14.029
Estimated time for completion
of the Tholian web.

44:14.098 --> 44:15.030
2 minutes, sir.

44:15.099 --> 44:16.532
Are the ships computers
programmed

44:16.600 --> 44:18.534
for entry
into interspace?

44:18.602 --> 44:22.538
Yes, sir. The ship can drive
into interspace at any time.

44:22.606 --> 44:23.937
Spock to engineering.

44:24.008 --> 44:24.940
Scott here.

44:25.009 --> 44:27.170
Prepare for interphase
in 15 seconds.

44:27.244 --> 44:28.677
Aye, sir.
Standing by.

44:28.746 --> 44:30.771
Mr. Spock,
they're closing the web.

44:34.185 --> 44:36.551
Interphase
in 10 seconds,

44:36.620 --> 44:37.678
9,

44:37.755 --> 44:39.052
8,

44:39.123 --> 44:41.057
7,

44:41.125 --> 44:42.422
6,

44:42.493 --> 44:43.425
5--

44:43.494 --> 44:45.052
Stand by with full power.

44:45.129 --> 44:47.689
- 4, 3--
- She's only up to 76%.

44:47.765 --> 44:49.062
It will have to do.

44:49.133 --> 44:50.395
1.

44:50.468 --> 44:52.333
Ready to transport
on my order.

44:57.375 --> 44:58.569
- I see him.
- There he is!

44:58.642 --> 45:00.473
It's the captain.

45:00.544 --> 45:02.478
The tractor field
is activating.

45:02.546 --> 45:04.411
We're being
pulled out of here.

45:04.482 --> 45:06.279
Maintain position
Mr. Sulu.

45:08.386 --> 45:09.648
I can't, sir.

45:09.720 --> 45:12.188
Bring ship's power
up to full capability.

45:22.199 --> 45:25.032
Where are we now,
Mr. Spock?

45:33.377 --> 45:35.971
Captain, we have destroyed
the Tholians' web.

45:36.047 --> 45:37.173
Negative, Ensign.

45:37.248 --> 45:39.910
The ship's power
has thrown us clear of it.

45:39.984 --> 45:42.214
Compute the distance
from the original location.

45:42.286 --> 45:43.344
At once, sir.

45:43.421 --> 45:44.513
Have we lost
the captain?

45:44.588 --> 45:46.522
We shall soon see,
Lieutenant.

45:46.590 --> 45:49.718
The ship has been thrown
exactly 2.72 parsecs

45:49.794 --> 45:52.160
distant from
our previous position.

45:52.229 --> 45:55.665
Good. Since the captain was
locked into our transporter beam

45:55.733 --> 45:57.166
when we were thrown clear,

45:57.234 --> 45:59.668
he should've been
drawn here with us.

45:59.737 --> 46:00.965
Spock to transporter room.

46:01.038 --> 46:02.164
McCoy here.

46:02.239 --> 46:04.969
The captain's oxygen supply
is running out now.

46:05.042 --> 46:06.168
Are you standing by

46:06.243 --> 46:08.677
with a hypo of
triox-compound for him?

46:08.746 --> 46:10.179
I'm ready,
Mr. Spock.

46:10.247 --> 46:12.511
Prepare to transport on
the captain's coordinates

46:12.583 --> 46:13.515
on my order.

46:13.584 --> 46:14.516
Ready,
Mr. Spock.

46:21.225 --> 46:23.386
Mr. Spock, it's him!

46:23.461 --> 46:25.019
It's the captain!

46:26.097 --> 46:27.359
I see him, Ensign.

46:29.233 --> 46:30.928
I see him.

46:34.271 --> 46:35.670
Now, Doctor.

47:07.238 --> 47:08.330
Bones.

47:08.405 --> 47:10.930
Welcome home, Jim.

47:20.317 --> 47:22.683
I had a whole universe
to myself

47:22.753 --> 47:25.187
after the Defiant
was thrown out.

47:25.256 --> 47:28.692
There was absolutely
no one else in it.

47:28.759 --> 47:32.695
I must say I prefer a crowded
universe much better.

47:32.763 --> 47:35.197
How did you two
get along without me?

47:35.266 --> 47:36.699
Oh, we managed.

47:36.767 --> 47:40.203
Mr. Spock gave the orders,
and I found the answers.

47:40.271 --> 47:41.863
No problems
between you?

47:41.939 --> 47:43.634
None worth reporting,
Captain.

47:43.707 --> 47:45.538
Try me.

47:45.609 --> 47:49.204
Only such
minor disturbances,

47:49.280 --> 47:52.443
as are inevitable when
humans are involved.

47:52.516 --> 47:54.484
Which humans,
Mr. Spock?

47:54.552 --> 47:58.113
He means when humans become
involved with Vulcans, Jim.

47:58.189 --> 48:00.089
Ah, yes.

48:00.157 --> 48:01.249
I understand.

48:03.327 --> 48:04.760
Well,
I hope my last orders

48:04.828 --> 48:07.160
were helpful
in solving any problems

48:07.231 --> 48:10.291
that you don't feel
worth reporting.

48:10.367 --> 48:11.664
Orders, Captain?

48:11.735 --> 48:14.226
What orders are you
referring to, Jim?

48:14.305 --> 48:15.738
My last orders.

48:15.806 --> 48:19.139
The last orders that I
left for both of you.

48:22.179 --> 48:23.578
The last taped orders.

48:23.647 --> 48:25.080
Oh, those orders.

48:25.149 --> 48:26.582
Well, there wasn't time.

48:26.650 --> 48:28.174
We never listened
to them.

48:28.252 --> 48:31.187
No. You see,
the crisis was upon us,

48:31.255 --> 48:34.418
and then passed so quickly,
Captain, that we--

48:34.491 --> 48:36.186
Good.

48:36.260 --> 48:37.693
Good.

48:37.761 --> 48:41.697
Well, I hope we won't have
similar opportunities

48:41.765 --> 48:44.199
to test those orders...

48:44.268 --> 48:45.963
which you never heard.

48:50.774 --> 48:53.140
Ahead warp factor 2,
Mr. Sulu.

48:53.210 --> 48:55.144
Warp factor 2, sir.
