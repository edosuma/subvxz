00:14.200 --> 00:18.960
The Chinese are pressing the case that we're
involved in the assault on their consulate.

00:19.040 --> 00:21.360
Have they found evidence
beyond the video of me?

00:21.440 --> 00:23.440
No, and we have to make sure they don't.

00:23.520 --> 00:27.120
You were part of the team
that mounted the assault on our consulate.

00:27.200 --> 00:31.240
If you won't tell us who is
ultimately responsible, that leaves you.

00:35.160 --> 00:39.240
- If it's Stealth, we can't track it by radar.
- Those missiles travel at a speed of 600mph.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.880
It could hit a target
on either coast in under three hours.

00:41.960 --> 00:46.160
That's assuming it's headed for the coast.
If not, it could hit its target at any time.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.320
What is CTU gonna do now
to find the missile?

00:48.400 --> 00:49.400
At this point,

00:49.480 --> 00:53.800
CTU has no reasonable expectation of finding
the missile before it reaches its target.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.320
I gave you the responsibility to stop this.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.560
You've failed me, David,

00:58.640 --> 01:00.920
and you've failed your country.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.440
- Drop the gun. It's over.
- " Do it, Jack.

01:05.519 --> 01:07.920
Do you really have what it takes to let me
kill him while you're looking him in the eye?

01:08.000 --> 01:10.080
- Yes.
- Tony.

01:13.800 --> 01:17.000
I have the power to give you a deal
signed by the president.

01:17.080 --> 01:21.320
In exchange, you can help me find Marwan
and stop this warhead from hitting its target.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.200
Show me the deal.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.960
- "Buchanan."
- Has the president signed the pardon yet?

01:36.040 --> 01:39.240
Any minute. I don't like
that we're cutting this woman a deal.

01:39.320 --> 01:42.600
- We can't verify she's telling the truth.
- We don't have a choice.

01:42.680 --> 01:46.400
Only she can lead us to Marwan
and he's controlling the missile.

01:48.160 --> 01:51.040
Has the attorney general
reviewed this agreement?

01:51.120 --> 01:54.640
Yes, sir. We should be getting
his final approval any minute now.

01:54.720 --> 01:59.960
Mr President. I'm sorry to interrupt,
but there's something you might wanna see.

02:00.040 --> 02:03.640
It may affect the immunity agreement.

02:03.720 --> 02:05.240
What is it, Aaron?

02:05.320 --> 02:09.800
The woman you're about to pardon,
I'm pretty certain you've met her before.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.600
Explain.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.960
- May I?
- Absolutely.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.920
On the right is the hostile we have in custody.

02:21.840 --> 02:26.880
On the left is news footage from
four and a half years ago in Los Angeles,

02:26.960 --> 02:30.280
moments before the attempt on your life.

02:34.720 --> 02:41.000
You're telling me the woman we're about
to cut a deal with tried to assassinate me?

02:41.080 --> 02:42.280
Yes, sir.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.840
- Novick.
- " The agreement is in order."

02:48.920 --> 02:51.000
All right. Thank you.

02:51.080 --> 02:55.240
Mr President. The attorney general says
the immunity agreement is in order,

02:55.320 --> 02:57.800
ready to be signed.

02:57.880 --> 03:02.640
If I read this right, it grants immunity,
not only for what this woman has done today,

03:02.720 --> 03:05.480
but for any crime
she's ever committed in the past.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.640
That is correct, sir.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.960
Sign it.

03:20.640 --> 03:25.320
We're trying to get you the deal,
but we will pull it if the missile hits first.

03:25.400 --> 03:30.920
I will talk when
my representatives confirm my immunity.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Not before.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.520
Manning.

03:36.600 --> 03:40.480
- "Todd Richards. Let me speak to my client."
- Yeah. She's right here.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.320
- I'm listening.
- "The document's signed by the president."

03:46.400 --> 03:49.960
- And is the paperwork in order?
- "Yes. It grants you total immunity."

03:50.040 --> 03:52.320
Good.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.000
- Where's Marwan?
- The Global Center.

03:55.080 --> 03:59.800
A helicopter is waiting for him on the roof.
That will be taking him to a ship.

03:59.880 --> 04:02.800
If he flies low enough, he'll evade radar.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.120
When's he leaving?

04:06.080 --> 04:08.120
- Now.
- Get the chopper ready.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.080
Alpha Four, have a chopper ready.

04:10.160 --> 04:13.040
She stays here until we verify this.

04:18.480 --> 04:21.240
Sam, this is Bernhart.

04:29.240 --> 04:33.000
Capturing Marwan alive
is our only chance of stopping this warhead.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.920
We are not to use lethal force,
even in self-defence.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.360
Got it.

04:45.360 --> 04:46.680
Let's go.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.000
She's not answering her phone.

05:13.080 --> 05:17.160
- She should have been here already.
- She said she was delayed.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.320
We're not waiting.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.880
How long is it to the ship
and international waters?

05:30.960 --> 05:32.960
Ten minutes.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.600
Something's wrong.

05:57.280 --> 06:01.640
Roger, Los Angeles Air. You need
to keep this frequency clear, you copy?

06:03.400 --> 06:07.520
Edgar, it's Jack. We're almost there.
Have you got confirmation on the target?

06:07.600 --> 06:13.200
We've just repositioned the satellite.
The images are coming through now.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.800
On top of the Global Center, I see a chopper.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.240
- "Southeast corner."
- Copy that.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.560
I want you to take a southeast approach.
Stay below the building.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.640
Yes, sir.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.680
The missile's still on target. We've gotta go.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.600
Just a few minutes until we're up to speed.

06:38.680 --> 06:42.080
" We have visual on the building.
Approaching northwest.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.320
Copy that, CTU.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.640
- OK, come up over the building now.
- Yes, sir.

06:55.120 --> 06:59.280
" Don't let him take off.
Stay above him.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.520
- Go. Go!
- He's right on top of me.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.560
- Go!
- The engine's out.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.600
Put me in a position to bail.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.640
" There he is.

08:09.400 --> 08:11.520
I got you covered.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.280
Clear.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.160
Tell me where the missile is.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.840
Tell me where it is.

10:10.320 --> 10:12.720
Tell me where it is.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.000
Argh!

10:21.360 --> 10:22.640
No.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.840
No!

10:31.160 --> 10:32.960
No!

11:05.920 --> 11:08.600
Bauer had orders to take Marwan alive.

11:08.680 --> 11:12.240
- I'm sure Jack did whatever he could.
- That's not good enough.

11:12.320 --> 11:16.960
CTU is searching Marwan's helicopter, trying
to find something to locate the missile.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.960
- We're out of time.
- Not yet.

11:19.040 --> 11:23.080
Mr President. I'm sorry to add
to an already difficult situation,

11:23.160 --> 11:28.280
but the acting Chinese consul, Su Ming,
is on teleconference. He says it's urgent.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.040
Put him through.

11:37.480 --> 11:40.320
Gentlemen. As we discussed earlier,

11:40.400 --> 11:43.800
our consulate in Los Angeles
was attacked three hours ago.

11:43.880 --> 11:47.840
A Chinese citizen was abducted
and our consul killed.

11:47.920 --> 11:52.840
We've already given you our assurance
that we had no knowledge of this attack.

11:52.920 --> 11:57.640
Which is strange, since one of your agents
has confessed his direct involvement

11:57.720 --> 12:00.200
and implicated his superior as well.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.520
What are you talking about?

12:04.520 --> 12:07.000
My name is Howard Bern.

12:07.080 --> 12:11.160
I'm a federal agent with
the Counter Terrorist Unit in Los Angeles,

12:11.240 --> 12:16.120
speaking of my own free will, under no duress.

12:16.200 --> 12:21.320
I participated in an unlawful assault
on the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles.

12:22.320 --> 12:28.000
I was acting under the orders of special
advisor to the secretary of defense...

12:28.960 --> 12:31.120
Jack Bauer.

12:32.040 --> 12:36.440
Mr Bern provided details which
leave no doubt that he is telling the truth.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.280
The full tape will be
forwarded to you immediately.

12:39.360 --> 12:43.840
Putting aside the question of how
this so-called confession was obtained,

12:43.920 --> 12:45.960
what does your government expect us to do?

12:46.040 --> 12:49.080
Mr Bauer committed a crime at our consulate,

12:49.160 --> 12:51.680
which is Chinese territory.

12:51.760 --> 12:56.360
If he was acting without your approval,
he should be turned over to our government,

12:56.440 --> 13:00.160
to be tried and sentenced
according to our laws.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.480
Mr Su, we'll get back to you.

13:07.640 --> 13:11.680
Dammit, David.
You said this would be handled.

13:11.760 --> 13:14.440
I'm sure the Chinese don't want war.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.120
No. But they do want to embarrass us.

13:17.200 --> 13:21.560
Take the moral high ground
in the court of world opinion.

13:21.640 --> 13:24.920
We need to take
the least damaging course of action.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.240
- Unfortunately, then, there's only one option.
- Which is?

13:29.320 --> 13:32.360
- We hand Bauer over to the Chinese.
- Unacceptable.

13:32.440 --> 13:36.080
Besides, if we turn him over,
he'll implicate this administration.

13:36.160 --> 13:39.320
The Chinese made Bern talk.
They'll do the same with Bauer.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.000
Bauer would never
compromise national security.

13:42.080 --> 13:45.080
As much as I'd like to believe that,
everyone breaks.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.600
What you believe is irrelevant.

13:54.040 --> 13:57.680
There is another option, Mr President.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.120
Go on.

13:59.200 --> 14:02.680
Suppose something happens to Bauer.
Suppose he has an accident.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.720
- That's an obscene suggestion.
- It solves a lot of problems.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.160
Mr President!

14:09.880 --> 14:13.000
This administration
does not condone murder.

14:16.080 --> 14:19.640
And it never will. Is that clear?

14:19.720 --> 14:22.080
Yes, sir.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.160
I'm sorry, sir.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.680
- Find anything on Marwan?
- We're still looking. You OK?

14:36.760 --> 14:40.320
- Be better once we take this missile down.
- We have found something.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.360
It's been shot up,
but one of the drive platforms is intact.

14:43.440 --> 14:46.480
It's a tracking or navigation program,
with a GPS node.

14:46.560 --> 14:51.040
- Adams has uplinked whatever's left to CTU.
- OK, thanks.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.000
Buchanan.

14:53.080 --> 14:55.160
It's Jack. Forensics found something...

14:55.240 --> 14:58.000
Chloe's got it.
She's trying to download the interface.

14:58.080 --> 15:01.480
- " Put her on."
- I'll put you on speaker.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.720
- You're on.
- Got anything on that program?

15:03.800 --> 15:06.680
Nothing yet. Give us a second, Jack.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.840
- It's totally random.
- Maybe try a correlation matrix.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.720
- What's that gonna do?
- Just do it, Edgar.

15:20.120 --> 15:25.080
- I told you it wasn't going to work.
- That's cos you didn't expand the parameter.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.360
See?

15:26.440 --> 15:30.120
- What have you got?
- Two parallel columns. Data points damaged.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.080
What do you mean "parallel columns"?

15:32.160 --> 15:36.840
It could be a flight path.
I'll try plotting them over the US GS map.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.040
It's working.

15:42.120 --> 15:45.560
If that's a flight path,
it's headed due west over Nevada.

15:47.560 --> 15:50.400
It's Los Angeles. It's gotta be.
It's coming towards LA.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.840
Chloe, run a time analysis.

15:54.680 --> 15:58.680
Assuming the missile travels at 600mph,
it puts it within this 30-mile segment.

15:58.760 --> 16:01.680
I'll get those coordinates to the air force.

16:02.320 --> 16:05.280
- "Clark."
- Captain Clark. Bill Buchanan, CTU.

16:05.360 --> 16:09.840
The missile's heading for LA. We've narrowed
the possible coordinates. Uploading now.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.800
- " Squad's in the air, sir."
- OK, thanks.

16:12.880 --> 16:17.560
They have planes in the air. If our projections
are correct, they should find it quickly.

16:17.640 --> 16:22.400
They better, since the casualty figures of
an LA air strike would be over a million lives.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.920
- Including ours.
- Put the military channel on the speaker.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.920
Delta One approaching sector.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
Roger that, Delta One.
Still no joy target searching.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.520
If the missile's shot down,
could it detonate?

16:38.600 --> 16:42.720
No. The warhead is specifically designed
not to blow up until it hits its target.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.480
But the impact could trigger
the arming mechanism?

16:45.560 --> 16:48.000
- It's unlikely.
- But it is possible, right?

16:48.080 --> 16:52.720
Yes, it's possible, but we don't have a choice.
We're out of time here.

16:57.640 --> 17:02.000
Delta Two, this is Pointcom.
We have a contact at 3846 degrees north.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.240
Bearing 120. Respond.

17:04.319 --> 17:09.560
Closing in on those coordinates.
Possible contact. Breaking left.

17:12.160 --> 17:14.520
I've got tally on the target. 12 o'clock.

17:14.599 --> 17:18.280
- Missile checks good. I'm armed.
- " Cleared to lock on target."

17:18.359 --> 17:21.680
- "Target acquired."
- "Good luck. Repeat, good luck."

17:21.760 --> 17:24.319
Delta Two is in range.
Request clearance to engage.

17:24.400 --> 17:28.400
Delta Two.
Target confirmed. Clear to engage.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.600
I've got good tone. Fox Two, missile away.

17:42.360 --> 17:47.160
Splash One. That's a direct hit, Delta One.
Target is down. I repeat, the target is down.

18:06.320 --> 18:09.200
Miss Dessler, here's the report so far.

18:09.280 --> 18:13.080
No nuclear radiation was emitted
when the missile was destroyed.

18:13.160 --> 18:17.400
Debris hit the ground and there was
some damage and several injuries.

18:17.480 --> 18:21.480
- No loss of life was...
- We'll pick this up later.

18:33.600 --> 18:37.920
- When they told me you were dead...
- I know. I'm sorry.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.480
I love you.

18:44.560 --> 18:48.600
I didn't realise how much
until I thought I'd lost you.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.200
What is it?

18:56.680 --> 18:58.640
When that woman called and she...

18:58.720 --> 19:01.160
Hey, hey, hey. You did what you had to do.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.040
But I didn't do what you did.
You chose me and I chose...

19:04.120 --> 19:07.520
Look, we did the best we could, all right?

19:07.600 --> 19:10.440
Now it's over.

19:23.240 --> 19:27.280
Did you get the information
that I sent you? And do you know yet?

19:27.360 --> 19:30.360
No. The commercial flights are still grounded.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.960
I'm trying to get Paul back
on a military transport.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.120
Let me know if I can do anything.

19:35.200 --> 19:38.720
I haven't taken care of his funeral yet.
I need to call his mother.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.440
She doesn't know?

19:41.520 --> 19:44.360
Well, just let the staff know...

19:47.760 --> 19:52.840
Listen, I'm gonna have to get back to you.
There's something that I need to deal with.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.920
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.360
Your father said
you're going to Washington.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.840
Yeah. I have to take care of Paul's funeral.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.240
Yeah.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.320
And after that?

20:26.800 --> 20:32.320
I'm sorry. I know this isn't
the right time to talk about everything.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.880
Maybe tomorrow we could get together.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.440
Jack, I don't think that's a good idea.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.600
We agreed we wouldn't make
those kinds of decisions today.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.680
I know, but I just...

20:50.760 --> 20:52.680
Audrey.

20:53.680 --> 20:59.440
I love you. I want to spend the rest
of my life with you. That's all I want.

21:03.080 --> 21:06.560
We both know that you belong here, Jack.

21:06.640 --> 21:10.440
At CTU, doing what you do best.

21:10.520 --> 21:16.520
And thank God there are people like you
who can deal with that world.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.280
But I can't.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.600
Please don't say that.

21:28.680 --> 21:30.120
Jack.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.200
Oh, Jack.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.760
I love you.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.040
But after today, it's just...

21:47.480 --> 21:49.480
It won't work.

21:54.160 --> 21:56.680
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.960
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, this is David Palmer.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.720
Yes, Mr President.

22:14.800 --> 22:18.160
Words cannot express
the debt this country owes you.

22:18.240 --> 22:21.480
- Thank you, sir.
- Jack, this is hard for me.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.160
But I don't seem to have a choice.

22:25.120 --> 22:30.200
The Chinese have proof
that you led the assault on their consul.

22:30.280 --> 22:34.800
- What kind of proof?
- "Howard Bern made a full confession."

22:34.880 --> 22:37.880
He identified you as the agent in charge.

22:37.960 --> 22:39.640
And now the Chinese want me?

22:39.720 --> 22:43.240
That's right.
And we have no choice but to comply.

22:44.520 --> 22:45.760
I see.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.840
What they really want is you
to implicate the government.

22:48.920 --> 22:53.160
- Mr President, that will never happen.
- I know that.

22:54.680 --> 23:00.600
They'll put you on trial, propagandise about
American arrogance, and put you in prison.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.640
I understand.

23:04.880 --> 23:08.200
Jack, this is unfair, to say the least,

23:08.280 --> 23:10.880
and I'm ashamed of my part in it...

23:12.280 --> 23:14.160
but I promise you this,

23:14.240 --> 23:19.440
I will make it my life's purpose to bring you
back to American soil as soon as possible.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.640
I know you'll do what you can, sir.

23:24.960 --> 23:27.560
Secret Service
is sending over an agent to CTU.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.800
He'll place you under house arrest.

23:29.880 --> 23:33.960
But you'll have some time
to put your affairs in order.

23:37.280 --> 23:40.480
Jack, my friend,
I wish there was something else I could say.

23:40.560 --> 23:44.440
Mr President,
you're doing what has to be done.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.520
So will I.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.200
I know you will.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.600
- Thank you, Jack.
- Thank you, sir.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.040
This is a messy situation.

24:05.120 --> 24:08.520
Even if Bauer doesn't implicate
the president in the attack,

24:08.600 --> 24:10.680
there are other problems.

24:10.760 --> 24:13.240
Bauer's special advisor
to the secretary of defense,

24:13.320 --> 24:17.800
which makes him a high-value prisoner
and a gold mine of information.

24:17.880 --> 24:21.360
- The Chinese could squeeze him dry.
- You're right.

24:21.440 --> 24:24.960
Plus they could share information
with any intelligence agency.

24:25.040 --> 24:28.880
What they get out of Bauer
could find its way into the hands of terrorists.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.920
This could set us back years.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.520
- So the bottom line is...
- I don't think you need me to spell that out.

24:37.840 --> 24:40.400
I assume this isn't coming
from President Logan?

24:40.480 --> 24:43.960
Absolutely not. He's expressly forbidden it.

24:44.040 --> 24:47.240
But that doesn't mean
he'd be sorry if it happened.

24:47.320 --> 24:52.320
- So any investigation into Bauer's death?
- Will be brief and superficial.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.800
- I'll see to it personally.
- "Fine. I'll take care of it."

24:55.880 --> 24:56.960
Good.

25:22.720 --> 25:27.240
- The president ordered Jack be extradited.
- Cummings wants Bauer dead.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.400
Logan shot him down. We were both there.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.920
It was a weak rebuke at best.

25:34.720 --> 25:37.600
This is conjecture,
based on one side of a conversation.

25:37.680 --> 25:41.680
I know what I heard
and I know Cummings. You don't.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.200
You really think he's capable of this?

25:45.280 --> 25:48.640
He's been doing Logan's dirty work
for the last 15 years.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.680
Logan's used to looking the other way.

25:50.760 --> 25:53.640
I'd tell the president myself,
but he won't listen to me.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.840
If you don't intervene now, it may be too late.

26:00.200 --> 26:03.360
The prime minister's offering
to host a conference in London

26:03.440 --> 26:06.320
for improving the flow
of intelligence information.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.640
Tell him I accept his gracious offer.

26:09.720 --> 26:13.400
You should tell him yourself.
He wants to congratulate you personally

26:13.480 --> 26:16.760
for steering the country
so effectively in its time of crisis.

26:16.840 --> 26:19.000
- Set up a call.
- Yes, sir.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.520
David.

26:27.200 --> 26:30.600
I have been overwhelmed
by the outpouring of goodwill

26:30.680 --> 26:32.600
from heads of state around the world.

26:32.680 --> 26:35.160
Well-deserved, Mr President.

26:37.400 --> 26:40.160
You played a role, David.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.800
You played a role.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.360
Thank you, sir.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.800
So what can I do for you?

26:52.480 --> 26:57.040
Would you excuse us?
I'd like a moment alone with the president.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.040
Yes, sir.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.000
Sir, I believe that your security chief

27:07.080 --> 27:11.280
may be pre-empting your decision
to hand Jack Bauer over to the Chinese.

27:11.360 --> 27:15.920
- Pre-empting me how?
- By killing him before they can take custody.

27:16.000 --> 27:19.560
For God's sake, David.
Cummings was just speaking hypothetically.

27:19.640 --> 27:21.840
You can't take that at face value.

27:21.920 --> 27:25.800
Besides which, I told him it wasn't an option.

27:27.120 --> 27:31.280
I'm asking you to talk to Cummings
and make sure he understands your order.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.840
I can't indulge some half-baked conspiracy.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.680
I think I've earned the privilege
of having my concerns taken seriously.

27:37.760 --> 27:39.880
You have.

27:39.960 --> 27:42.600
But it's also no secret that your presidency

27:42.680 --> 27:47.240
was infected with a certain level
of paranoia and scandal.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
I won't allow that in my administration.

27:51.080 --> 27:57.360
Questioning my security chief undermines
his authority and would compromise mine.

27:59.080 --> 28:01.160
Hear no evil.

28:02.840 --> 28:05.280
- I beg your pardon.
- You heard me.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.680
David.

28:11.760 --> 28:17.040
Thank you again for your assistance today,
but it's time for you to go back to civilian life

28:17.120 --> 28:19.800
and let me do my job.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.480
Hi, Jack.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.360
Hey.

29:07.160 --> 29:11.240
I found out Logan's making you take the fall
for what happened at the consulate.

29:11.320 --> 29:13.680
No one's making me do anything.

29:13.760 --> 29:16.200
The president didn't have a choice.

29:16.280 --> 29:19.800
Yeah, well, that doesn't make it fair, does it?

29:19.880 --> 29:22.520
It is what it is.

29:23.520 --> 29:25.680
- This is Bauer.
- Are you still at CTU?

29:25.760 --> 29:28.720
Yes, sir.
Tony Almeida's just about to debrief me.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.440
Listen to me very carefully.

29:30.520 --> 29:33.040
Do not turn yourself in.

29:34.280 --> 29:37.880
The man they sent to take you
into custody has orders to kill you.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.560
- Orders from who?
- "Someone in Logan's camp."

29:40.640 --> 29:42.960
They think the Chinese will break you.

29:43.040 --> 29:47.160
- Logan authorised this?
- Not directly, but he won't stop it.

29:47.240 --> 29:50.280
Now, listen to me. Get out of there now.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.920
Thank you, sir.

30:23.520 --> 30:26.040
Bill Buchanan,
regional director of Division.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.800
Dale Spaulding, Secret Service.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.800
You'll have to sign this before I take Bauer.

30:31.880 --> 30:35.600
- What is it?
- Chain of custody authorisation.

30:35.680 --> 30:38.440
I'm not signing anything
till Bauer's been debriefed.

30:38.520 --> 30:41.520
When that happens, he's all yours.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.120
Fair enough.

30:43.200 --> 30:47.840
We'd be burying a million Americans
right now if it wasn't for Jack Bauer.

30:47.920 --> 30:49.480
He's a hero.

30:49.560 --> 30:52.200
I'm sure he is. I'm just following orders.

30:52.280 --> 30:55.280
I want him treated
with the respect he deserves.

30:55.360 --> 30:56.480
Of course.

31:02.800 --> 31:07.680
Tony's on line one. Says it's urgent.
Something to do with Jack.

31:07.760 --> 31:09.520
- Buchanan.
- Bill, it's Tony.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.800
- Jack escaped.
- Escaped?

31:11.880 --> 31:14.840
He took me by surprise.
There was nothing I could do.

31:14.920 --> 31:19.120
He's still inside, somewhere in section C.
I'm the one who ordered the lockdown.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.480
- I'll be right there.
- All right.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.480
Bauer's trying to get away.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.960
Jack disabled the surveillance feed.

31:46.040 --> 31:50.160
- Were you able to make visual contact?
- Yes, he's still in section C.

31:50.240 --> 31:53.200
Jack was willing to turn himself over.
What happened?

31:53.280 --> 31:56.400
- I can't say for sure, but he got a phone call.
- Who from?

31:56.480 --> 32:00.280
I don't know. I was waiting for him,
next thing I know, I'm on the ground.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.240
- Does Bauer have a weapon?
- Yeah.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.920
- How many exits?
- Four. They're all blocked off.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.400
- He'll try to punch through.
- I have two guards at each point.

32:08.480 --> 32:10.440
- I'm not taking chances.
- What are you doing?

32:10.520 --> 32:12.000
- Going after him.
- Wait.

32:12.080 --> 32:15.960
I've orders to take Jack Bauer into custody.
I intend to execute those orders.

32:16.040 --> 32:19.720
- This building is my jurisdiction.
- You lost that when you lost Bauer.

32:19.800 --> 32:23.280
If you want me to stand down,
call the president, otherwise stay away.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.880
- I'm going with you.
- No. I'm doing this alone.

32:25.960 --> 32:29.440
Either you take Tony
or you're not going anywhere.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.160
Follow me.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.480
Jack, it's Tony.

32:48.560 --> 32:51.120
Are you in here?

32:53.960 --> 32:56.040
Come on, let's talk.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.760
It doesn't have to go down like this.

33:05.160 --> 33:06.240
Jack.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.480
Give it up.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.880
Stay out of my way.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.480
This is over.

33:21.480 --> 33:27.480
I'm gonna go break Jack out. You wanna
stop me, you can shoot me in the back.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.680
Jack.

33:30.760 --> 33:33.720
I'm putting my weapon down. I'm coming in.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.520
Jack.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.200
Jack.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.680
He's dead.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.400
- You killed him.
- He was shooting at us.

34:21.480 --> 34:27.239
He was aiming wide. He was laying down
cover fire. If he wanted to, he'd have hit us.

34:28.080 --> 34:29.480
My God, Jack.

34:29.560 --> 34:31.560
You killed him, you son of a bitch!

34:31.639 --> 34:33.639
Get him outta here!

34:33.719 --> 34:36.239
Take him to the situation room.

34:42.239 --> 34:44.320
I'm sorry.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.400
Oh, God, Jack.

35:10.160 --> 35:12.280
Give me the epinephrine.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.400
I hope it's not too late. He really looks dead.

35:18.480 --> 35:20.720
That was the idea, Chloe.

35:28.320 --> 35:31.400
How fast is it supposed to take effect?

35:36.040 --> 35:38.040
Come on, Jack.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.480
Come on, man.

35:46.720 --> 35:47.720
Tony...

35:47.800 --> 35:50.400
Come on, Jack. Dammit!

35:56.600 --> 35:57.680
Hey.

35:57.760 --> 36:00.240
Hey, can you hear me?

36:00.320 --> 36:02.840
- You know where you are?
- Yeah.

36:04.680 --> 36:07.800
Chloe, run interference with the local coroner.

36:07.880 --> 36:11.480
Until we can switch bodies. Sync up
their database with Jack's information.

36:11.560 --> 36:14.320
- That won't cover the autopsy.
- There won't be one.

36:14.400 --> 36:17.520
They wanted Jack dead. Now he's dead.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.640
Bill.

36:28.880 --> 36:34.480
I just talked to my father. He said Jack was
being handed to the Chinese government.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.960
He was supposed to be.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.920
But he tried to escape.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.280
I don't understand.

36:45.520 --> 36:47.120
Neither do I.

36:52.760 --> 36:54.320
No.

36:56.880 --> 36:59.720
- Audrey.
- No. Don't say it.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.840
No.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.960
I'm sorry.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.480
All right. We're clear.

37:56.040 --> 37:59.640
- Are you sure you're OK, Jack?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

38:02.640 --> 38:06.000
You both need to get back to CTU
before anyone gets suspicious.

38:06.080 --> 38:10.320
- You can drop me off anywhere up there.
- All right.

38:10.400 --> 38:12.880
Your new identity
should get you across the border.

38:12.960 --> 38:15.320
OK. Did you get me a clean phone?

38:15.400 --> 38:21.080
Yeah. It has a scramble filter.
You can talk up to one minute undetected.

38:31.000 --> 38:34.920
I can't thank you both enough for everything.

38:41.080 --> 38:43.080
You gotta get going.

38:50.640 --> 38:52.440
Jack.

38:58.040 --> 39:00.400
Be careful.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.360
Yeah.

39:04.400 --> 39:05.960
You too.

39:07.480 --> 39:10.120
Thank you both for everything.

39:36.840 --> 39:39.320
- Palmer.
- Mr President. It's Jack Bauer.

39:40.920 --> 39:45.240
- You threaded the eye of the needle.
- I had some help, sir.

39:45.320 --> 39:50.840
I wanted to thank you for advising me of
the situation. Mr President, you saved my life.

39:50.920 --> 39:53.520
I'm only sorry it came to this.

39:53.600 --> 39:56.480
Me too, sir. I just wanted
to let you know that I was out.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.560
I'm glad.

40:00.600 --> 40:03.960
This is probably the last time we'll ever speak.

40:05.920 --> 40:10.680
Jack, you do understand, when you hang up,
for all intents and purposes,

40:10.760 --> 40:12.840
Jack Bauer is dead.

40:13.960 --> 40:16.040
I understand that, sir.

40:17.920 --> 40:20.920
Mr President, it's been an honour.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.280
Same for me, my friend.
