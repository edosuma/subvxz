<i>Previously on</i> Stitchers...

00:00.458 --> 00:01.680
- What's your name?
- Kirsten.

00:01.705 --> 00:03.351
- I'm Cameron.
- Cameron met a girl.

00:03.376 --> 00:04.398
Linus: Her name is Nina.

00:04.423 --> 00:06.397
- Wait, does Kirsten know about Nina?
- She does now.

00:06.422 --> 00:08.246
Kirsten: I don't want things
to be awkward between us

00:08.271 --> 00:09.765
and I want to protect our friendship.

00:10.076 --> 00:11.133
The boy is here.

00:11.158 --> 00:12.272
- The red cap kid?
- Yeah!

00:12.297 --> 00:13.873
Liam Granger is a soft target.

00:13.898 --> 00:15.223
I need to find out what his role is

00:15.248 --> 00:16.748
and who he's playing for.

00:16.773 --> 00:17.951
- Camille?
- Liam!

00:17.976 --> 00:18.954
Oh, my God!

00:18.978 --> 00:21.292
Liam believes my joining
his gym was a coincidence.

00:21.317 --> 00:23.104
- And Linus?
- Wanna do somethin'?

00:23.129 --> 00:25.242
I have this huge
optogenetics project due.

00:25.267 --> 00:26.039
I hate lying to him.

00:26.064 --> 00:28.099
Well, the less he
knows, the safer he is.

00:28.124 --> 00:31.168
Kirsten: <i> What I really want to do is
find that son-of-a-bitch father of mine</i>

00:31.193 --> 00:32.561
<i>and bring him to karmic justice.</i>

00:32.586 --> 00:35.006
My father had a first wife. Elizabeth.

00:35.031 --> 00:36.390
Elizabeth Stinger got remarried

00:36.415 --> 00:37.957
and changed her name to Elizabeth Brown.

00:37.982 --> 00:39.478
There are over 250 listings

00:39.503 --> 00:41.402
in California alone under that name.

00:48.854 --> 00:50.577
Are you sure?

00:50.602 --> 00:52.142
Yes.

00:52.167 --> 00:53.648
It's not too late to change your mind.

00:53.673 --> 00:55.533
I've never been more sure
of anything in my life.

00:55.558 --> 00:57.277
Ooh...

00:57.725 --> 00:59.373
- You are correct.
- Mm!

00:59.398 --> 01:01.515
"Don't cross the streams" is,
in fact,<i> Ghostbusters.</i>

01:01.540 --> 01:04.221
"We should never come here again"

01:04.293 --> 01:06.564
"because it would never be as much fun."

01:06.589 --> 01:08.520
<i>- Lost in Translation.</i>
- That's too easy.

01:08.545 --> 01:09.511
(chuckles)

01:09.536 --> 01:12.277
- (phone beeping)
- Oh, my gosh.

01:12.301 --> 01:14.448
- Is that work?
- No, it's...

01:14.473 --> 01:15.344
(chuckles)

01:15.368 --> 01:17.845
my alarm...  to get up for work.

01:17.901 --> 01:20.986
Did we really just stay up
all night talking movies?

01:21.011 --> 01:22.658
No, we started with video games.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.583
- Oh, yes, yes.
- And then we, uh,

01:24.608 --> 01:27.257
leisurely made our way to best
comic book superhero team.

01:27.282 --> 01:29.203
- Avengers. (coughs)
- We are not having this discussion.

01:29.228 --> 01:30.750
Uh, Justice League. And then...

01:30.775 --> 01:31.148
Ugh!

01:31.173 --> 01:32.730
And then we went out
for a delicious, uh...

01:32.756 --> 01:34.164
- Ugh.
- Pre-dawn snacks.

01:34.189 --> 01:37.296
Pastrami hotdog I'm going to
regret in about three hours.

01:37.413 --> 01:41.239
And then we ended up pulling
our first all-nighter.

01:41.264 --> 01:42.990
All-nighter.

01:46.629 --> 01:49.009
That was the most fun I've
had in a really long time.

01:49.034 --> 01:50.303
Me too.

01:50.328 --> 01:53.583
Do you wanna come over to
my place tonight after work?

02:01.141 --> 02:03.335
You know,
just because you come over doesn't mean

02:03.360 --> 02:04.732
I want you staying indefinitely.

02:04.757 --> 02:06.939
I just gotta get ready for work.

02:07.727 --> 02:09.578
I'm being that guy right now, aren't I?

02:09.603 --> 02:10.693
- Little bit.
- I'm sorry.

02:10.719 --> 02:12.243
Look,
I don't mean to give you mixed signals.

02:12.268 --> 02:13.878
Just it's late, it's... it's early.

02:13.903 --> 02:16.420
- Come on.
- Relax, okay?

02:17.572 --> 02:19.755
I'm just saying it would be nice.

02:19.780 --> 02:21.472
(chuckles)

02:50.882 --> 02:52.341
Coco!

02:52.366 --> 02:53.976

Hi, is this Elizabeth Brown?

03:24.219 --> 03:26.256
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm looking for a man

03:26.281 --> 03:28.407
named Daniel Stinger. Do you know him?

03:28.432 --> 03:30.425
Are... are you sure?

03:30.835 --> 03:32.232
My name's Kirsten.

03:32.257 --> 03:34.947
I'm looking for a man
named Daniel Stinger.

03:35.666 --> 03:41.206
Stinger? Uh, well... well,
it's "S" as in... Sam...

03:41.231 --> 03:43.057
Hi, is this Elizabeth Brown?

03:43.082 --> 03:44.131
"R".

03:44.304 --> 03:45.491
No, no.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.382
No, no, no, it's... it... "R."

03:47.418 --> 03:50.029
O... okay.
Can... can you tell me if... if, uh,

03:50.054 --> 03:54.056
either of them were,
uh, previously married?

03:54.081 --> 03:55.389
Uh, to a man.

03:55.414 --> 03:57.736
Thank you so much for your help.

03:58.890 --> 04:01.049
(knocking)

04:01.074 --> 04:03.441
Don't you think it's time
you came up for some air?

04:03.939 --> 04:05.685
- Or food?
- No.

04:05.710 --> 04:07.413
No, I'm fine.

04:07.437 --> 04:08.929
I just have to figure
this out, you know,

04:08.955 --> 04:10.466
and Elizabeth Brown is the key, so...

04:10.491 --> 04:12.898
Honey, Elizabeth Brown
is one of many keys,

04:12.923 --> 04:15.964
including but not
limited to good hygiene,

04:15.989 --> 04:18.183
proper nutrition, and not obsessing,

04:18.208 --> 04:21.125
all of which you could afford
to pay more attention to.

04:21.151 --> 04:22.428
Particularly, that last one.

04:22.453 --> 04:24.419
Okay. Take a shower.

04:24.455 --> 04:25.343
Let's go to work.

04:25.368 --> 04:27.070
Okay.

04:27.102 --> 04:27.843
But you know what?

04:27.868 --> 04:29.789
There is actually nothing
wrong with my hygiene.

04:29.814 --> 04:31.072
Look. I'm fine.

04:31.097 --> 04:34.177
Mm, I don't know.

04:38.883 --> 04:41.226
Okay, time is of the
essence on this one,

04:41.251 --> 04:42.980
so let's dive right in.

04:43.005 --> 04:44.193
Linus: That's Coco Soo.

04:44.218 --> 04:46.219
- Coco who?
- Uh, Coco Soo.

04:46.244 --> 04:49.284
She's the biggest pop
star in China. Ever.

04:49.309 --> 04:50.892
How do you know about her?

04:50.917 --> 04:53.688
Forgive me for knowing about
international pop culture.

04:53.713 --> 04:56.023
I'm not interrupting you all, am I?

04:56.342 --> 04:59.093
Coco was in Los Angeles
for the opening leg

04:59.118 --> 05:00.236
of her first U.S. tour.

05:00.261 --> 05:01.360
Ten cities in three weeks.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.814
Her fans are gonna be
devastated when they find out.

05:04.805 --> 05:05.754
What?

05:05.779 --> 05:08.377
Last night,
Coco was found in her dressing room

05:08.402 --> 05:10.319
by her body guard, Mei Ling...

05:10.344 --> 05:13.178
Who was passed out and possibly drunk

05:13.203 --> 05:13.914
during the murder.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.123
Authorities are en route

05:15.148 --> 05:17.449
to retrieve Coco's body for her husband

05:17.474 --> 05:19.913
and bring Mei Ling back to face charges.

05:19.938 --> 05:21.570
- That's her husband?
- Linus: Liang Soo.

05:21.595 --> 05:24.744
Zillionare industrialist.
He bankrolled Coco's career.

05:24.769 --> 05:27.347
Liang Soo is well connected
in high places in China.

05:27.372 --> 05:30.240
We have a small window
to find Coco's killer

05:30.265 --> 05:31.532
and keep this from becoming

05:31.557 --> 05:34.081
a festering, international incident.

05:34.645 --> 05:37.122
Should we be concerned you know so much

05:37.147 --> 05:38.815
about a Chinese pop star?

05:40.218 --> 05:42.018
(phone chirps)

05:42.043 --> 05:43.042
Nina?

05:43.067 --> 05:45.116
Hm? Oh.

05:45.535 --> 05:47.767
Uh, yeah.

05:49.146 --> 05:52.307
You know, you...
you can talk about her around me.

05:52.332 --> 05:54.035
It doesn't have to be super awkward.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.743
I know. It's just...

05:55.768 --> 05:57.288
weird talking to you about another girl.

05:57.313 --> 05:59.208
Cameron, we're friends. It's fine.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.282
I'm totally cool with it.

06:00.307 --> 06:01.687
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

06:01.712 --> 06:02.960
Good. I mean...

06:02.985 --> 06:04.451
I... I think you'd like her.

06:04.476 --> 06:05.862
You guys should... meet.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.284
Yeah! I would love to.

06:08.466 --> 06:10.865
Right now, I... I'm just, um...

06:10.890 --> 06:12.271
kind of using all of my spare time

06:12.296 --> 06:14.579
to, like, dig up a lead
on Elizabeth Brown.

06:14.604 --> 06:16.725
Yeah, no,
and I understand you're trying to find

06:16.750 --> 06:18.018
your father and get some closure,

06:18.043 --> 06:20.505
but I think you obsessing
over this is what's causing

06:20.530 --> 06:22.522
the boy in the red cap
anomalies in your stitches.

06:22.851 --> 06:24.417
The boy in the red cap is there.

06:24.442 --> 06:26.467
I'm not imagining things.

06:28.491 --> 06:29.732
Wait, have you...

06:29.757 --> 06:31.465
Have you talked to Maggie about this?

06:31.489 --> 06:33.239
No, and I'd rather not,

06:33.264 --> 06:35.058
but if the worry starts to get real...

06:35.083 --> 06:36.949
I'm gonna have to.

06:40.472 --> 06:42.829
You know...  I'd actually... I...

06:42.854 --> 06:44.923
I would actually love to meet Nina.

06:44.948 --> 06:46.060
What are you guys doing tonight?

06:46.085 --> 06:47.112
Dinner? I'll cook.

06:47.137 --> 06:49.173
Oh. We could just order in.

06:49.198 --> 06:51.046
No, no, no, no. I'll cook. It'll be fun.

06:51.071 --> 06:51.732
7:00?

06:52.618 --> 06:53.773
Yeah.

06:53.798 --> 06:54.805
- Great.
- Yeah.

06:54.830 --> 06:57.691
All right. Well, um, I mean, I've
told her, like, everything about you.

06:57.715 --> 06:58.827
- Really?
- You're... Yeah.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.015
You're gonna...  You're gonna love her.

07:11.063 --> 07:12.283
Hey.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.100
Is everything okay?

07:14.125 --> 07:15.459
I couldn't help but notice

07:15.484 --> 07:16.926
you've been a little distracted lately.

07:16.951 --> 07:18.870
Oh.

07:18.895 --> 07:19.944
Well, I mean...

07:19.969 --> 07:23.053
I mean,
after all that drama with Theo, yeah.

07:23.078 --> 07:25.279
I... I have just kind of
wanted a little bit of me time

07:25.304 --> 07:26.679
to recharge, you know?

07:26.705 --> 07:28.158
Me time. I... I totally get it.

07:28.182 --> 07:29.850
I'm totally down with me time

07:29.876 --> 07:32.801
as long as it's not code for
"There's something I have to tell you."

07:32.826 --> 07:33.809
It's not.

07:33.834 --> 07:35.516
Good.

07:35.729 --> 07:38.857
Well, maybe we can squeeze
in some us time soon?

07:39.349 --> 07:40.866
Sure.

07:40.891 --> 07:42.648
Great.

07:48.726 --> 07:51.693
Maybe I should take you
off your assignment.

07:52.290 --> 07:54.564
It's taking an emotional toll.

07:54.589 --> 07:55.555
I can handle it.

07:55.580 --> 07:58.017
I didn't mean an emotional toll on you.

08:01.131 --> 08:06.714
I've put in way too much time
grooming Liam to stop now.

08:08.574 --> 08:10.448
All right.

08:10.861 --> 08:12.976
Mission clock to five minutes.

08:14.051 --> 08:15.917
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.

08:15.942 --> 08:20.413
In three, two, one, mark!

08:21.409 --> 08:24.257
- (pop music playing)
- (cheering)

08:29.206 --> 08:30.434

08:30.459 --> 08:32.601
- (giggling)
- (shutters clicking)

08:32.626 --> 08:34.138
You looked great out there.

08:34.163 --> 08:36.327
You looked even better
yesterday with your boyfriend.

08:36.352 --> 08:38.832
I know you don't speak English,
but this you'll understand.

08:39.773 --> 08:42.482
(shutter clicking)

08:42.506 --> 08:43.346
You want that?

08:43.371 --> 08:45.038
Hey, give me 200,000.

08:45.063 --> 08:47.141
Dollars, not yuan.

08:47.166 --> 08:50.608
Coco's being blackmailed
by a paparazzo creep.

08:50.633 --> 08:52.683
He's, uh, got a picture
of her with some guy

08:52.708 --> 08:53.657
and not her husband.

08:53.682 --> 08:55.130
Any way to I.D. the man in the picture?

08:55.155 --> 08:56.590
No. Nothing.

08:56.615 --> 08:59.811
(both speaking Chinese)

08:59.836 --> 09:03.274
(conversation repeats)

09:03.475 --> 09:05.342
- You all right?
- No. Where were you?

09:05.367 --> 09:07.067
Why was he able to get to me?

09:07.091 --> 09:10.058
Guys, I... I just understood Chinese.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.873
- Seriously?
- Cameron: It makes total sense.

09:11.898 --> 09:12.930
Kirsten's in Coco's mind.

09:12.955 --> 09:14.846
She hears Chinese,
she synthesizes the meaning.

09:14.871 --> 09:15.590
Wow.

09:15.615 --> 09:17.138
Take me to Coco's dressing room.

09:17.163 --> 09:18.927
- Stand by.
- (click)

09:18.952 --> 09:20.825
Yeah, but this happened because
you went out without my protection!

09:20.850 --> 09:23.735
- I don't need you every second of my life.
- That is my job!

09:23.760 --> 09:25.562
And it's my choice if
you get to keep your job,

09:25.587 --> 09:26.885
so back off.

09:26.910 --> 09:28.772
Kirsten: Sounds like Coco
gave her bodyguard the slip.

09:28.797 --> 09:30.908
Probably to meet the man in the picture.

09:34.676 --> 09:36.207
I'll be next door if you need me.

09:36.792 --> 09:39.108
Okay, I've got Coco's
death memory mapped.

09:39.133 --> 09:41.116
Okay. Kirsten,
we can move you to the time of death.

09:41.141 --> 09:42.649
Let us know when you're ready.

09:43.173 --> 09:44.836
Let's do it.

09:45.259 --> 09:46.469
(knocks on door)

09:46.494 --> 09:47.876
Mei Ling?

09:47.901 --> 09:51.797
I'm sorry I went out without you.

09:52.223 --> 09:55.085
I promise I'll explain soon.

09:55.372 --> 09:56.513
Mei Ling?

09:56.538 --> 09:58.267
Coco's trying to apologize,

09:58.292 --> 10:01.264
but Mei Ling's giving
her the cold shoulder.

10:03.595 --> 10:05.334
Mei Ling?

10:05.359 --> 10:07.158
What...

10:07.868 --> 10:09.818
- (muffled scream)
- Heart rate is elevating.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.465
Talk to me, K. Your
ticker's on warp speed.

10:11.490 --> 10:13.142
Coco's being attacked by someone.

10:13.167 --> 10:14.656
I... I can't see a face.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.296
She's close to the death moment.

10:18.123 --> 10:19.952
(screams)

10:19.977 --> 10:22.654
(clattering, shattering)

10:22.679 --> 10:23.901
Blood pressure dropping.

10:23.926 --> 10:25.914
Kirsten, make the bounce!

10:26.028 --> 10:29.842
Man: Where? Where is he?

10:31.858 --> 10:34.950
Coco was attacked by a Chinese man.

10:34.975 --> 10:37.046
Her bodyguard, Mei
Ling, was unconscious.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.236
Before Coco died, the
man tried to get her

10:40.261 --> 10:41.884
to give up the location of some guy.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.212
You mean the older dude
from the paparazzo's photo?

10:44.237 --> 10:47.090
(sighs) Unfortunately,
the true answer died with Coco.

10:51.486 --> 10:53.305
So the man on the paparazzo's camera

10:53.330 --> 10:54.495
was not Coco's husband.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.828
The paparazzo said he was her boyfriend.

10:56.853 --> 10:58.018
Coco didn't deny it.

10:58.043 --> 10:59.112
Then he had no reason to kill her.

10:59.137 --> 11:00.126
She was his golden goose.

11:00.151 --> 11:01.579
Wait, can we just talk for a sec

11:01.604 --> 11:03.888
about how Kirsten was able
to understand Chinese?

11:03.913 --> 11:05.913
I really think we should
test for neuroplasticity.

11:05.938 --> 11:07.753
- No.
- Okay, just continue.

11:07.778 --> 11:09.744
Maybe the husband got jealous

11:09.769 --> 11:12.272
and sent an assassin to
kill Coco and her boyfriend?

11:12.297 --> 11:13.442
Cameron: Well, it makes total sense.

11:13.467 --> 11:15.873
We're a guilt culture,
China's a shame culture.

11:15.898 --> 11:16.957
Honor is huge over there.

11:16.982 --> 11:17.981
They would do anything to save face

11:18.006 --> 11:19.481
or the shame will follow them forever.

11:19.506 --> 11:21.094
Hey, maybe the bodyguard
knows something.

11:21.119 --> 11:22.218
Where's Mei Ling now?

11:22.243 --> 11:24.791
LAPD is holding her until
their superiors arrive

11:24.816 --> 11:26.980
to claim Coco's body,
then it's back to China.

11:27.005 --> 11:28.880
Okay, I'll have Fisher bring
her in for questioning.

11:28.906 --> 11:30.500
Alex can translate.

11:30.525 --> 11:32.868
Maybe she knows who Coco
was seeing on the side.

11:33.729 --> 11:35.799
Okay, don't be scared.
You're not under arrest.

11:35.824 --> 11:37.576
- You understand?
- (mumbles)

11:37.601 --> 11:40.094
En... English? Do you speak any English?

11:40.119 --> 11:41.783
I'm taking you some place

11:41.808 --> 11:43.420
where you can answer some
questions about Coco.

11:43.446 --> 11:44.854
Who she was seeing,
why she snuck away from you,

11:44.879 --> 11:47.605
and you have no idea what I'm saying.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.399
Food? H... hungry?

11:49.424 --> 11:50.467
You're hungry!

11:50.492 --> 11:51.911
Oh, great! Now that's progress.

11:51.936 --> 11:54.133
I know a Chinese restaurant
where we're going... Oh!

11:54.458 --> 11:55.809
Hey!

11:56.908 --> 11:59.241
That did not just happen.

12:03.460 --> 12:06.177
- Whew. Whew.
- (chuckles)

12:06.202 --> 12:07.834
I have to tell you, I'm very impressed.

12:07.859 --> 12:09.316
Ah, it's no big deal.

12:09.341 --> 12:10.440
I've been kicking ass for years.

12:10.465 --> 12:12.398
I mean, with your skill level

12:12.423 --> 12:14.196
considering you haven't
been training that long.

12:14.221 --> 12:16.481
Oh, well, thank you.
You're quite good yourself.

12:16.505 --> 12:17.871
Where'd you first learn?

12:17.896 --> 12:19.632
Uh, from an American friend.

12:19.657 --> 12:21.669
Brilliant mentor.

12:21.695 --> 12:22.777
He was a big believer

12:22.802 --> 12:25.441
that a person should be
able to defend his family.

12:25.466 --> 12:27.299
I worked with him all
through grad school.

12:27.324 --> 12:28.656
Who is he?

12:29.305 --> 12:31.620
This friend of yours,
you still in touch with him?

12:32.643 --> 12:34.894
Not really. Why?

12:34.919 --> 12:37.245
Just sounds like he took
a real interest in you.

12:37.270 --> 12:38.748
Yeah, unlike someone I know.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.119
Are you joking?

12:40.144 --> 12:41.684
Does it not look like I'm interested?

12:41.709 --> 12:43.446
Yeah, but only in training.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.656
You do remember I'm roomies

12:45.680 --> 12:47.434
with the girl you wanted to marry?

12:47.459 --> 12:48.714
Thought I wanted to marry.

12:48.739 --> 12:49.738
I never had any problem

12:49.763 --> 12:52.534
putting Kirsten out of my
mind during my travels.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.256
But I can't stop thinking about you.

13:02.945 --> 13:05.020
Dinner tonight?

13:06.732 --> 13:08.231
(chuckles)

13:10.653 --> 13:12.570
You're trouble.

13:12.595 --> 13:13.781
(elevator dings)

13:13.806 --> 13:15.620
I... Hey.

13:15.645 --> 13:17.900
Fisher, where's the bodyguard?

13:17.925 --> 13:19.988
- I don't want to talk about it.
- She didn't...

13:20.013 --> 13:21.045
I said I don't want to talk about it!

13:21.070 --> 13:22.686
Is Kirsten still checking
out backstage photos?

13:22.711 --> 13:25.251
The Chinese will be here
in less than 20 hours,

13:25.276 --> 13:28.544
and you let our best lead
handcuff you to a bike rack

13:28.569 --> 13:29.618
and escape?

13:30.046 --> 13:33.239
Thank you, Maggie,
for that additional emasculation.

13:33.264 --> 13:34.909
But I will get her back. Trust me.

13:34.934 --> 13:38.065
- Wait, wait...
- I said I don't want to talk about it!

13:38.554 --> 13:41.427
Hey, Fisher. Nice job
with the bodyguard.

13:41.799 --> 13:44.047
You see any photos of Mei
Ling talking to anybody?

13:44.072 --> 13:45.795
Anyone or anything that
doesn't look quite right?

13:45.820 --> 13:47.136
No. Why? Think she was in on it?

13:47.161 --> 13:48.994
I don't know,
but I need you to help me find her.

13:49.019 --> 13:50.714
Okay.

13:55.998 --> 13:57.914
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:57.939 --> 14:00.529
That's him. That's the guy
who was blackmailing Coco.

14:00.554 --> 14:01.603
X24.

14:01.628 --> 14:03.578
That's the biggest paparazzi
agency in Hollywood.

14:03.603 --> 14:05.603
Okay. I'll email them a picture
to see if they can I.D. him.

14:05.628 --> 14:06.886
- Great.
- Then you can tell me how

14:06.911 --> 14:08.891
Mei Ling cuffed you to that bike rack.

14:25.282 --> 14:28.116
- Fisher?
- Yeah, don't touch anything.

14:33.908 --> 14:34.856
Let me call it in.

14:36.836 --> 14:38.982
It looks like his camera was taken.

14:39.007 --> 14:40.666
(shuffling)

14:45.171 --> 14:47.054
Oh, hi.

14:47.079 --> 14:48.368
Remember me?

14:57.338 --> 14:59.987
_

15:00.012 --> 15:02.296
She doesn't know who
killed the paparazzo.

15:02.321 --> 15:04.589
Ask her why he wanted money from Coco.

15:04.614 --> 15:06.113
What did he have on her?

15:06.143 --> 15:09.348
_

15:12.306 --> 15:16.405
_

15:17.949 --> 15:21.414
Um, she says you're not the boss of her.

15:21.579 --> 15:23.373
Maggie: I'm also not the one

15:23.398 --> 15:25.867
facing years of prison
and shame, either.

15:26.285 --> 15:29.753
We can't help you if you don't
help us find Coco's killer.

15:29.778 --> 15:32.180
- _
- Hey, let me take a crack at it.

15:34.155 --> 15:36.327
Fisher, we don't work that way.

15:36.352 --> 15:37.615
What?

15:38.150 --> 15:41.820
No, sometimes a cop rolls up his sleeves
'cause he wants his sleeves rolled up.

15:41.845 --> 15:44.833
Oh. Okay, go for it.

15:44.858 --> 15:47.378
In private, if I may.

15:47.450 --> 15:49.233
Take it from here.

15:49.258 --> 15:52.283
You too, Alex. Thanks.

15:58.489 --> 16:02.537
Okay. We both know you speak English.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.723
So let's get that out of the way.

16:05.183 --> 16:09.423
It's your life, but you didn't give me the
slip to avoid prison or get redemption.

16:09.448 --> 16:13.096
Someone killed your friend.
You want revenge.

16:14.445 --> 16:16.329
I want justice.

16:16.354 --> 16:19.188
Coco was like a sister to me.
I would do anything to protect her.

16:19.213 --> 16:21.681
Then why did you drink yourself
unconscious the night she was killed?

16:21.706 --> 16:23.490
I didn't. I don't drink.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.255
Someone poisoned the water in my room.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.247
Well, your toxicology
report isn't back yet,

16:27.272 --> 16:29.238
so why should I believe you?

16:29.263 --> 16:31.054
Believe whatever you want.

16:32.757 --> 16:34.250
What is this place?

16:34.275 --> 16:36.192
A government facility.

16:36.217 --> 16:38.360
The Chinese authorities
are coming for you.

16:38.385 --> 16:42.287
They'll be here in...
just under 16 hours.

16:42.312 --> 16:45.246
After that, my ability
to help you is over.

16:45.271 --> 16:46.304
I don't need your help.

16:46.329 --> 16:47.697
Yes, you do.

16:48.990 --> 16:51.303
Who did that photographer catch
in that picture with Coco?

16:51.328 --> 16:53.331
Who did she go off to meet?

16:54.639 --> 16:56.373
She didn't tell me she
was seeing someone.

16:56.398 --> 16:58.276
I have no idea who her lover is

16:58.301 --> 17:00.057
or who would want to kill her.

17:00.082 --> 17:01.720
Her husband?

17:01.750 --> 17:04.242
- He's an old man.
- Old men get jealous.

17:04.284 --> 17:07.292
Well, maybe he was jealous of the time
her work took away from seeing him,

17:07.318 --> 17:10.080
but he knew how talented Coco was.
He was banking on her.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.584
So Coco was his investment?

17:12.608 --> 17:14.175
Yeah, and a profitable one.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.740
He was not going to hurt her.

17:15.765 --> 17:17.628
Well, then who would?

17:18.027 --> 17:22.060
I don't know, but I need to find them.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.916
Will you help me?

17:25.942 --> 17:29.129
Now you're speaking my language.

17:40.879 --> 17:42.879
(phone ringing)

17:42.904 --> 17:44.632
- _
- (man on phone speaking)

17:44.632 --> 17:47.093
_

17:47.118 --> 17:49.483
_

17:49.508 --> 17:52.017
_

17:52.042 --> 17:54.297
- _
- (man on phone speaks Chinese)

17:54.808 --> 17:56.456
_

18:05.370 --> 18:06.696
Elizabeth Brown?

18:06.721 --> 18:08.288
<i>This is her mother. Who is this?</i>

18:08.313 --> 18:09.919
May I please speak with her?

18:10.283 --> 18:12.522
<i>She passed away six years ago.</i>

18:12.547 --> 18:15.411
I'm so sorry.

18:16.174 --> 18:19.233
Uh, do you, by any chance, know

18:19.258 --> 18:22.681
if your daughter knew a
man named Daniel Stinger?

18:24.136 --> 18:25.754
Hello?

18:26.319 --> 18:28.332
(hangs up)

18:29.887 --> 18:32.383
I will take that as a yes.

18:34.650 --> 18:36.649
Whoa, hey, where's the fire?

18:36.674 --> 18:39.591
Sorry. I, uh, I...
I just found my Elizabeth Brown.

18:39.616 --> 18:41.356
Oh! When you gonna talk to her?

18:41.381 --> 18:46.423
Uh, never. She died a few years ago.

18:46.448 --> 18:49.439
But her mother hung up on me
when I mentioned Stinger, so...

18:49.464 --> 18:51.892
So we'll just do dinner another night.

18:52.619 --> 18:55.484
Dinner. Nina. Right.

18:55.509 --> 18:57.912
You know,
we can do it another time or not at all.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.041
- Look, you really don't have to.
- No, no, I want to.

19:00.066 --> 19:01.393
I'm looking forward to meeting Nina.

19:01.418 --> 19:03.127
Are you sure? What about your lead?

19:03.152 --> 19:04.810
It doesn't matter.

19:04.835 --> 19:07.262
I will go grocery shopping for dinner.

19:07.287 --> 19:08.403
Any requests?

19:08.918 --> 19:10.349
Not burnt.

19:10.374 --> 19:11.963
Okay.

19:14.974 --> 19:17.995
Any luck hacking the
paparazzo's cloud account?

19:18.020 --> 19:21.240
No. Apparently the stalker also didn't
believe in storing photos in the cloud.

19:21.264 --> 19:23.128
His camera was missing
from the crime scene.

19:23.153 --> 19:25.645
Most likely stolen by
the paparazzo's killer.

19:25.670 --> 19:27.706
Whatever was in those photos
is what got Coco killed.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.373
When's the refractory period up?

19:29.398 --> 19:31.219
Tomorrow morning.

19:31.244 --> 19:33.611
Stitching again should give
us more info on the photos.

19:33.636 --> 19:35.463
- So we have the night off?
- Uh, yeah.

19:35.488 --> 19:36.997
Unless something else comes up.

19:37.887 --> 19:41.053
Oh, hey, do you want
to go to Spinella's?

19:41.078 --> 19:42.633
It's still early, we can get a table.

19:42.658 --> 19:44.541
Oh, god, yeah, about dinner.

19:44.566 --> 19:46.782
Don't hate me, I have a huge
optogenetics test this week.

19:46.807 --> 19:48.768
Oh, so come over. You study, I cook.

19:48.793 --> 19:51.570
I have to use the reference
section at the library. I'm sorry.

19:51.595 --> 19:54.131
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

19:54.477 --> 19:57.880
Better go before all the good
tables with outlets fill up.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.432
Good luck.

20:05.258 --> 20:06.651
Hey, what's up, Fish?

20:06.676 --> 20:10.576
- This is Mei Ling.
- Oh, Mei Ling.

20:10.601 --> 20:12.900
It's very nice to meet you.

20:12.925 --> 20:14.980
Knock it off, dude, she speaks English.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.324
Oh. My bad.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.491
Sorry to spring this on you,
but can we crash here tonight?

20:18.516 --> 20:20.276
What is it about my apartment
that everyone wants to crash here?

20:20.301 --> 20:21.745
Your apartment only has one door.

20:21.770 --> 20:25.488
If she decides to run again,
there's only one way out.

20:25.513 --> 20:27.128
Yeah, yeah. Sure, no problem.

20:27.152 --> 20:28.946
Um, make yourself at home, Mei Ling.

20:28.971 --> 20:31.720
I am headed out, but you two have fun.

20:31.745 --> 20:34.957
There's food in the fridge, just don't put
your feet up on the coffee table, okay?

20:34.982 --> 20:37.802
- I'm not an animal.
- Talking to Fisher.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.420
I just don't want you
to be nervous, is all.

20:43.445 --> 20:45.744
She is your co-worker,
why would I be nervous?

20:45.769 --> 20:48.057
She just used to be...

20:49.352 --> 20:50.580
socially awkward.

20:50.605 --> 20:52.205
Wait, are you nervous
about me meeting her?

20:52.230 --> 20:54.230
No! No, it's fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.

20:54.255 --> 20:55.338
I know.

20:55.363 --> 20:57.091
Okay.

20:57.567 --> 21:00.239
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

21:00.729 --> 21:03.319
(knocking)

21:03.344 --> 21:04.378
(chuckles)

21:06.415 --> 21:08.248
- Hi!
- Hello!

21:08.273 --> 21:10.120
- It's so lovely to meet you.
- It's so great to meet...

21:10.145 --> 21:11.560
(laughing)

21:11.864 --> 21:13.433
- You go.
- No, you go.

21:13.467 --> 21:15.995
Oh, my gosh, okay.
Now that we've met, can we eat?

21:16.020 --> 21:16.810
Yeah, come in.

21:16.835 --> 21:18.732
Let's eat.

21:24.003 --> 21:26.294
Thank you so much for having us over.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.975
That was the perfect dinner.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.964
- (laughs)
- Mmm, yeah.

21:29.989 --> 21:33.274
Interesting choice. Pancakes.

21:33.309 --> 21:35.183
Well, unlike some people,

21:35.208 --> 21:38.237
my skills in the kitchen
are limited, so...

21:38.262 --> 21:41.206
If you came over to my place,
I'd make you fish fingers and custard.

21:41.231 --> 21:41.809
Mmm...

21:41.834 --> 21:44.946
It's a <i> Doctor Who</i> thing.
She's obsessed.

21:44.971 --> 21:48.470
Uh, but yes, I have been known
to throw together a decent meal.

21:48.495 --> 21:50.838
Please. He is such a foodie.

21:50.863 --> 21:53.930
Have you had his world-famous
habanero salsa yet?

21:53.955 --> 21:56.506
Not yet. Holding out on me, huh?

21:56.531 --> 21:59.007
It was pretty spicy.
I don't know if you could handle it.

21:59.032 --> 22:01.279
I can handle it. I like spicy.

22:01.304 --> 22:03.204
- Okay.
- Bring it.

22:03.229 --> 22:05.026
Though, to be honest,
I'm happy you can't cook.

22:05.051 --> 22:05.526
Oh...

22:05.551 --> 22:07.993
Okay, no, no, no, no, no.
That came out wrong.

22:08.018 --> 22:11.127
I mean that you're not
some world-class chef.

22:11.152 --> 22:13.174
I mean, you can't be
perfect at everything.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.805
Oh, god, trust me, I
am so far from perfect.

22:15.831 --> 22:18.015
You wouldn't know that by the
way this guy talks about you.

22:18.040 --> 22:21.423
This brilliant, accomplished,
very tall woman.

22:21.448 --> 22:23.563
- You said that?
- Just the part about you being tall.

22:23.588 --> 22:25.581
- No. He said all of it.
- Come on.

22:25.606 --> 22:27.947
He really loves working with you.

22:27.973 --> 22:30.123
Well, I feel the same way about him.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.496
That is super sweet.

22:32.867 --> 22:35.752
Well, we should quit while I'm ahead.

22:35.777 --> 22:36.876
Point me to the bathroom first?

22:36.901 --> 22:38.250
Oh, it's just down the hall.

22:38.275 --> 22:40.052
Thank you.

22:45.414 --> 22:47.076
So?

22:47.694 --> 22:50.936
So... she's great.

22:51.185 --> 22:53.024
- Really.
- Cameron,

22:53.049 --> 22:54.857
she's lovely. What's not to like?

22:54.881 --> 22:57.849
I don't know. I just want to make
sure you're good with all this?

22:59.495 --> 23:01.818
Does Nina make you happy?

23:02.367 --> 23:03.408
Yeah.

23:03.433 --> 23:06.066
Then I'm good.

23:06.926 --> 23:09.330
Nina: Whoa!

23:13.742 --> 23:16.438
Oh, the door was open. I'm sorry.

23:16.463 --> 23:17.429
It's okay.

23:18.906 --> 23:20.470
What is all this?

23:20.495 --> 23:22.294
All what? Wha...

23:24.684 --> 23:27.447
Kirsten:
I was inspired about something for work.

23:27.931 --> 23:31.080
Couldn't find any scrap paper?

23:31.233 --> 23:35.831
You said Kirsten was
smart, but who knew?

23:35.856 --> 23:40.065
Yeah. Who knew?

23:43.561 --> 23:45.946
Well, I'm glad you talked
me out of ordering...

23:45.971 --> 23:47.021
- What?
- You know.

23:47.047 --> 23:49.124
Chinese food? (laughing)

23:49.149 --> 23:50.348
Yeah.

23:50.373 --> 23:52.531
Why would you want to
eat that in Los Angeles?

23:52.556 --> 23:54.223
Pizza is better.

23:54.248 --> 23:56.451
You know, if you want
the real deal pizza,

23:56.476 --> 23:57.731
you gotta go to New York.

23:57.756 --> 23:59.377
Well, New York...

24:01.063 --> 24:04.465
would have been the
last stop on our tour.

24:04.760 --> 24:07.101
You were drugged. It wasn't your fault.

24:07.401 --> 24:09.401
Excuses won't matter to Coco's husband.

24:09.426 --> 24:11.583
He hired me to keep her safe.

24:13.678 --> 24:15.675
You think they really loved each other?

24:15.700 --> 24:17.232
Pfft. How would I know?

24:17.257 --> 24:20.760
In my country, it is forbidden for
a bodyguard to be in a relationship.

24:20.785 --> 24:24.225
Love is considered
dangerous to both my safety

24:24.249 --> 24:26.853
and the safety of my employer.

24:27.715 --> 24:31.433
For me, love is more of a distraction.

24:31.994 --> 24:35.854
Actually, the lack of love.

24:37.320 --> 24:41.570
My wife, she...
She didn't like the kind of cop I was.

24:41.595 --> 24:46.156
So she told me I either
had to change or lose her.

24:46.680 --> 24:48.630
What kind of cop were you?

24:48.837 --> 24:50.637
Relentless.

24:51.476 --> 24:53.131
What kind of cop are you now?

24:53.156 --> 24:55.369
The same. Just divorced.

24:55.395 --> 24:57.061
Mmm.

24:57.983 --> 25:01.914
You just need to find someone
who's more understanding.

25:04.534 --> 25:06.401
I'm working on it.

25:09.307 --> 25:11.223
It's all yours.

25:11.248 --> 25:12.767
We can share.

25:14.169 --> 25:16.684
(laughing)

25:18.639 --> 25:21.008
Hey. Hey, thanks for coming tonight.

25:21.033 --> 25:22.288
Oh, it was fun.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.811
And how interesting was
that wall in Kirsten's room?

25:24.836 --> 25:28.434
Yeah.
Yeah, that was, um, pretty interesting.

25:28.458 --> 25:29.999
So, how'd I do?

25:30.024 --> 25:31.322
Does Kirsten approve?

25:31.347 --> 25:33.877
It wasn't about that?

25:34.427 --> 25:36.474
Yeah, she approves.

25:36.499 --> 25:39.807
Well, I think she's awesome.

25:39.831 --> 25:41.752
And I hope I get to know her better.

25:41.777 --> 25:44.644
Yeah, that'd be great. I think.

25:44.669 --> 25:46.585
(laughing)

25:47.688 --> 25:50.748
I would invite you over
to my place tonight,

25:50.773 --> 25:52.726
but I know you have to work tomorrow.

25:52.751 --> 25:55.237
Yeah. I do.

25:55.262 --> 25:56.713
Yeah.

25:56.738 --> 26:00.985
But... that's tomorrow.

26:03.320 --> 26:05.783
This is unnecessary.
I don't want you to be...

26:05.808 --> 26:07.494
- If Kirsten's awake.
- The lights are off.

26:07.519 --> 26:09.551
Kirsten's asleep.

26:09.576 --> 26:11.321
Well, okay.

26:11.346 --> 26:13.879
You walked me home, I'm
here, you can leave.

26:14.426 --> 26:18.601
Oh. Just tell me one thing.
Did you have a good time?

26:19.414 --> 26:22.542
Yes. I had...  I had a good time.

26:22.567 --> 26:24.753
I don't know how you have enough money

26:24.778 --> 26:27.462
for the most expensive Italian
restaurant in Los Angeles, but...

26:27.487 --> 26:29.321
I'm allowed to have refined tastes.

26:29.345 --> 26:30.416
Of course you are.

26:30.441 --> 26:32.774
You, I just picture, you know,

26:32.799 --> 26:33.931
somewhere exotic.

26:33.956 --> 26:37.051
Like, sitting in the dirt by a fire pit.

26:37.214 --> 26:41.207
Believe it or not, I'm not opposed
to occasionally using a chair.

26:41.840 --> 26:44.244
But one must not get too comfortable.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.209
Comfort leads to complacency,

26:46.234 --> 26:49.069
which leads to stagnation,
which leads to death.

26:49.094 --> 26:53.223
Ugh. What are you,
a nihilistic greeting card?

26:53.248 --> 26:56.723
I don't think I've ever heard
anything as brooding and intense.

26:56.748 --> 27:00.062
And I've had quite enough
of that the past few months.

27:03.898 --> 27:05.860
How's Kirsten's friend Cameron doing?

27:05.885 --> 27:07.787
Are they still friends?

27:08.092 --> 27:11.680
Um, yeah. Far as I know.

27:11.705 --> 27:13.570
- He's seeing someone else.
- Really?

27:14.733 --> 27:16.624
Kirsten seeing anyone else, too?

27:16.724 --> 27:17.828
Woof.

27:17.875 --> 27:20.321
You have absolutely no game.

27:20.346 --> 27:21.854
Could you be any more obvious?

27:21.880 --> 27:22.866
Just a casual question.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.860
- I thought you were over her?
- I am.

27:24.885 --> 27:26.685
I'm just curious.

27:27.424 --> 27:31.246
Lord, that accent makes even the
cheesiest lies sound charming.

27:31.271 --> 27:33.854
You're the one with the accent.

27:42.354 --> 27:45.810
Oh, I could stay like this all night.

27:56.713 --> 28:00.571
Well, perhaps you have more
game than I originally thought.

28:02.077 --> 28:03.505
Good night.

28:03.530 --> 28:05.436
You sure?

28:06.588 --> 28:08.572
Good night.

28:30.272 --> 28:32.681
Guess you didn't run after all.

28:36.871 --> 28:38.621
Morning, doc.

28:38.646 --> 28:39.816
Yup.

28:39.841 --> 28:41.774
- You okay?
- Yup.

28:41.799 --> 28:44.751
- You?
- On a scale of one to 10, I'm a 42.

28:44.776 --> 28:47.467
Well, isn't that just special for you?

28:47.754 --> 28:49.911
Oof. You look tired.

28:49.936 --> 28:51.772
Were you up all night working
on that Stringer board?

28:51.797 --> 28:52.633
Yup.

28:52.658 --> 28:54.065
Where's Camille?

28:54.089 --> 28:55.734
I'm not sure.

28:55.760 --> 28:58.004
Maybe she overslept?
I heard her get in really late.

28:58.028 --> 29:00.003
She told me she had to study last night.

29:00.855 --> 29:02.670
Hmm.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.723
What's up with Linus?

29:05.748 --> 29:07.193
- What's up with you?
- Me?

29:07.218 --> 29:09.098
You're annoyingly chipper this morning.

29:09.123 --> 29:11.604
Well, I'm sorry,
I had a really good time last night.

29:11.629 --> 29:14.560
All right? Thank you for being,
you know, so open and friendly to Nina.

29:14.585 --> 29:16.670
By the way, she's really sorry
about going in your room.

29:16.695 --> 29:17.535
Yup.

29:18.564 --> 29:20.364
You ready to go?

29:20.389 --> 29:23.021
We are indeed, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

29:23.059 --> 29:24.984
You got some last night, didn't you?

29:25.009 --> 29:27.417
A gentleman does not
disclose such information.

29:27.442 --> 29:30.138
That being said,
your CIA skills have not failed you.

29:30.674 --> 29:34.363
Lights at 20% please.
I need a go/no-go for stitch neurosync.

29:34.388 --> 29:35.387
- Life-Sci?
- Go.

29:35.412 --> 29:36.411
- Medical?
- Go.

29:36.436 --> 29:37.362
- Sub-bio?
- Alex: Go.

29:37.387 --> 29:38.336
- Engineering?
- Go.

29:38.361 --> 29:39.721
- Communications?
- Go.

29:39.746 --> 29:40.968
Comm check. (beat-boxes)

29:40.993 --> 29:43.717
I hear you, Chippy McChipperson.
Please don't ever do that again.

29:43.742 --> 29:45.998
I'll let that one slide.
Okay, guys, here we go.

29:46.023 --> 29:48.279
Sit tight, hold the fort,
keep the home fires burning.

29:48.304 --> 29:50.818
And if we're not back by dawn...
call the President.

29:50.843 --> 29:53.410
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.

29:53.435 --> 29:57.218
In three, two, one, mark.

29:59.013 --> 30:01.598
Yeah, but this happened because
you went out without my protection.

30:01.623 --> 30:03.402
I don't need you with me
every second of my life.

30:03.427 --> 30:04.311
That is my job!

30:04.336 --> 30:05.538
Where are you, Susie Q?

30:05.563 --> 30:07.884
I'm in Coco's dressing room again.

30:08.334 --> 30:10.465
Wait, stand by.

30:12.321 --> 30:16.240
The monitor's detecting some sort of
emotional token. It's really strong.

30:17.982 --> 30:19.677
Where are you at now?

30:19.702 --> 30:22.473
I'm in a greenhouse.
Coco's with an older man.

30:22.535 --> 30:25.474
- Can she I.D. him?
- Can you get any closer, Kirsten?

30:27.556 --> 30:29.840
He works here, he's a gardener.

30:29.865 --> 30:33.411
_

30:33.436 --> 30:36.465
_

30:36.754 --> 30:39.355
_

30:39.380 --> 30:41.346
_

30:41.371 --> 30:43.455
He's not her lover, he's her father.

30:43.480 --> 30:45.064
Camille?

30:45.816 --> 30:47.111
Where's Camille?

30:47.136 --> 30:48.144
She's not here, but I'm on it.

30:48.169 --> 30:49.418
(typing)

30:49.443 --> 30:51.978
Coco's father is a man named De Deshei.

30:52.003 --> 30:54.995
He's in prison in China for
insider trading at Son Industries.

30:55.020 --> 30:58.412
Okay, no, it can't be her father,
Kirsten. He's in a Chinese prison.

30:58.437 --> 30:59.708
Can you get a better
look at who she's with?

30:59.732 --> 31:02.373
I can feel Coco's connection to him.
He's definitely her father.

31:02.398 --> 31:03.867
And he works at this nursery.

31:03.892 --> 31:07.193
(speaking Chinese)

31:07.218 --> 31:11.307
I beg you to believe me.
I was set up. I'm innocent.

31:11.332 --> 31:13.813
Year after year you
say you are innocent.

31:13.838 --> 31:16.088
Why should I believe you now?

31:16.113 --> 31:21.176
- _
- (speaking Chinese)

31:21.230 --> 31:23.460
Kirsten: He's giving her a pendant.

31:23.485 --> 31:24.933
- Is it jade?
- Is it jade?

31:24.958 --> 31:26.491
- Yeah.
- We have it here.

31:26.516 --> 31:28.275
Coco was wearing it when
they brought her in.

31:28.300 --> 31:31.637
This was great-grandmother's.
I cannot take it.

31:31.662 --> 31:33.528
Yes, you can.

31:33.909 --> 31:35.876
You must do something for me.

31:35.901 --> 31:39.673
If someone comes and threatens
you to tell them where I am,

31:39.698 --> 31:41.252
you tell them.

31:42.005 --> 31:44.219
Hey!

31:46.743 --> 31:49.047
Shh.

31:49.763 --> 31:51.897
(computers beeping rapidly)

31:51.922 --> 31:53.458
This makes no sense.

31:53.483 --> 31:55.560
Maggie: Linus what are you seeing?

31:55.585 --> 31:59.320
Linus: It's an anomaly.
It's the same schism from before.

32:01.479 --> 32:02.962
Cameron?

32:02.987 --> 32:06.851
I'm here.
Kirsten, comm check, one-two, one-two.

32:06.876 --> 32:08.996
Okay, we've lost contact,
Linus, what's going on?

32:09.021 --> 32:12.184
I don't know. The system is registering
some sort of foreign entity.

32:12.209 --> 32:13.658
It must be some sort of errant code.

32:13.683 --> 32:15.793
- I want it tracked down.
- Me too.

32:15.818 --> 32:17.289
Talk to me, Kirsten, what's happening?

32:17.314 --> 32:18.498
Don't say anything.

32:18.523 --> 32:21.524
Remember, everyone in
the lab can hear you.

32:21.549 --> 32:24.724
Just think your words,
I'll understand them.

32:25.118 --> 32:26.951
Am I imagining you?

32:26.976 --> 32:29.837
No. I'm a construct built
by a friend of yours.

32:29.862 --> 32:31.599
What friend?

32:31.624 --> 32:35.359
Someone who cares about you,
but can't tell you.

32:36.621 --> 32:37.960
Cameron?

32:37.985 --> 32:40.524
I can't tell you. Not yet.

32:40.549 --> 32:42.532
Kirsten, comm check, one-two.

32:42.557 --> 32:45.028
So why do you look like
Cameron when he was a boy?

32:45.053 --> 32:48.326
I was created in the form of
someone your subconscious trusts.

32:48.351 --> 32:52.551
This was hopefully you'll be
predisposed to trust me too.

32:53.555 --> 32:55.868
You can't be real.

32:57.854 --> 33:00.800
There's something waiting
for you on your doorstep.

33:00.825 --> 33:06.148
When you go home and see what it is,
you'll know I am.

33:23.587 --> 33:26.142
Hey, what happened? Where'd you go?

33:26.167 --> 33:29.122
We lost you for 30 seconds.
It was right when the anomaly happened.

33:29.147 --> 33:30.476
How are you feeling?

33:30.501 --> 33:32.147
I'm fine. I'm fine.

33:32.171 --> 33:34.087
- Coco's father.
- De Deshei?

33:34.112 --> 33:36.583
Yeah. He works at a
Chinese nursery in Arcadia.

33:36.609 --> 33:38.790
How do you know it's a Chinese nursery?

33:38.815 --> 33:40.601
I read the characters on his uniform.

33:40.626 --> 33:43.086
I'm gonna call Fisher.

33:46.750 --> 33:49.652
(computer beeping)

34:02.215 --> 34:03.780
We're on our way.

34:03.869 --> 34:06.736
Whoever killed Coco was
actually after her father.

34:06.794 --> 34:09.164
- De Deshei?
- Yeah. You know him?

34:09.188 --> 34:10.408
But he's in a Chinese prison.

34:10.434 --> 34:12.042
No, he isn't. Coco met with him,

34:12.065 --> 34:14.688
and the killer was trying
to find him through her.

34:14.855 --> 34:19.580
If the killer finds out where De Deshei
is, then De Deshei is a dead man.

34:19.605 --> 34:22.663
Wait, wait, wait, this is my town,
we're gonna do this my way.

34:22.688 --> 34:26.061
Until your way doesn't work.
Then we do it my way.

34:26.085 --> 34:28.706
Fair enough.

34:35.589 --> 34:38.018
- _
- (speaking Chinese)

34:38.043 --> 34:40.411

34:40.436 --> 34:42.092

_

35:18.605 --> 35:22.049
_

35:22.808 --> 35:24.418
Fisher: Police!

35:44.670 --> 35:46.525
Mei Ling!

35:47.456 --> 35:49.144
Mei Ling!

35:50.202 --> 35:51.920
Let him go.

35:53.837 --> 35:55.323
Stay down.

35:56.214 --> 35:57.931
Fisher: You have the
right to remain silent.

35:57.959 --> 35:59.963
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

36:00.002 --> 36:01.830
- _
- You have the right to an attorney.

36:01.855 --> 36:04.316
If you cannot afford an attorney
one will be provided for you.

36:04.316 --> 36:06.762
_

36:06.787 --> 36:08.887
_

36:10.178 --> 36:13.012
Hey, hey, hey! Sorry we're late.

36:13.037 --> 36:15.404
Totally would have helped.

36:17.761 --> 36:20.415
(police radio chatter)

36:22.885 --> 36:26.863
So Bo Cheng was pretending to be part of
an undercover Chinese police task force

36:26.888 --> 36:28.736
called "Operation Snow Dragon,"

36:28.761 --> 36:30.971
but was really being paid by Mr. Wu

36:30.996 --> 36:33.550
to kill Coco's father to
cover up Wu's insider trading.

36:33.575 --> 36:35.605
So Coco's father was the fall guy.

36:35.630 --> 36:38.747
Cameron: Yeah.
You and Mei Ling saved his life.

36:47.011 --> 36:48.948
Mr. De?

36:56.582 --> 37:00.868
I am so sorry for your loss.

37:02.210 --> 37:05.749
I want you to know that your daughter
wasn't ashamed of you anymore.

37:05.774 --> 37:08.487
She... She knew you were innocent.

37:10.231 --> 37:14.704
I want to believe that,
but how do you know?

37:28.074 --> 37:32.885
_

37:34.656 --> 37:37.305
Coco believed you.

37:50.697 --> 37:52.812
Come on.

37:53.274 --> 37:55.304
Bo Cheng's been taken into custody.

37:55.370 --> 37:57.522
You've been cleared of any wrongdoing.

37:57.547 --> 37:59.364
Yeah, maybe officially,

37:59.389 --> 38:01.860
but my lapse of duty resulted
in Coco being killed.

38:01.885 --> 38:03.824
I'll always carry that with me.

38:04.071 --> 38:05.569
Hey.

38:06.587 --> 38:08.836
You and I protect people for a living.

38:09.118 --> 38:11.489
No matter how good we
are or how often we win,

38:11.514 --> 38:13.813
we're never gonna win all the time.

38:14.366 --> 38:19.334
Forgive yourself. Don't let this
moment define the rest of your life.

38:22.255 --> 38:24.313
Thank you for believing in me.

38:26.298 --> 38:28.524
Well, if I come back
to Los Angeles again,

38:28.549 --> 38:32.399
maybe I can let you take me out
for some authentic Chinese food?

38:32.424 --> 38:35.117
- (both chuckle)
- Yeah.

38:35.972 --> 38:38.839
Goodbye, Detective Fisher.

38:38.895 --> 38:40.836
Goodbye, Mei Ling.

38:49.975 --> 38:52.617
Hey, Kirsten, wait up.

38:53.010 --> 38:55.927
That was... That was really
nice what you did for Mr. De.

38:55.952 --> 38:58.183
You sound surprised?
What did you expect?

38:58.208 --> 39:00.074
Honestly,
I don't know what to expect from you.

39:00.099 --> 39:02.900
You're all over the place, all right?
And it's starting to worry me.

39:02.925 --> 39:05.560
All right, what happened in that
stitch when you went silent?

39:06.008 --> 39:07.180
- Nothing.
- Really?

39:07.205 --> 39:08.956
I'm pretty sure it was something, okay?

39:08.981 --> 39:11.894
You saw something. Was it that boy
in that red baseball cap again?

39:11.919 --> 39:13.816
Okay, you really gotta
learn when to let it go.

39:13.841 --> 39:15.912
You wanna discuss that
wall in your bedroom?

39:15.946 --> 39:17.963
Kirsten, I'm worried.

39:18.288 --> 39:20.450
Yeah. You already said that.

39:20.475 --> 39:22.475
You can be honest with me, all right?

39:22.500 --> 39:25.045
Whatever is going on, you can let me in.

39:25.571 --> 39:26.983
(elevator dings)

39:27.008 --> 39:29.580
I can take care of myself, okay?

39:29.605 --> 39:32.318
Go to Nina. She's the one who needs you.

39:42.942 --> 39:44.176
Hey.

39:44.201 --> 39:45.730
Hey.

39:46.689 --> 39:48.355
What's the matter, big guy?

39:48.380 --> 39:52.262
Buy you a slice and a glass of Chianti?
Turn that frown upside down?

39:53.118 --> 39:55.885
You weren't at the University
library last night.

39:55.910 --> 39:59.053
What? Of course I was.

39:59.079 --> 40:03.282
Really? Because I spent two
hours cooking you dinner

40:03.307 --> 40:05.585
because I didn't want you to go
hungry while you were studying.

40:05.610 --> 40:09.221
I then drove to Cal Tech to drop
the food off at the library,

40:09.245 --> 40:10.996
and you weren't there.

40:12.148 --> 40:15.614
Linus, I was in a private
study room in the back.

40:15.639 --> 40:17.715
- You should have texted...
- Straight up.

40:17.993 --> 40:20.286
Were you there?

40:23.844 --> 40:25.619
(sighs)

40:25.951 --> 40:27.821
No.

41:11.398 --> 41:15.747
