00:08.359 --> 00:13.696
Native American news, your source for
news on and off the reservation.

00:13.697 --> 00:15.609
How. Bad news today.

00:15.610 --> 00:18.234
Casino profits down. Liquor prices up.

00:18.235 --> 00:21.204
Offensive Native American
stereotypes at all-time high.

00:21.205 --> 00:23.539
- Now for weather.
- Look like sun.

00:25.542 --> 00:27.243
Make that rain.

00:27.244 --> 00:30.546
Now, for feel good news,
go to paleface reporter.

00:30.547 --> 00:33.882
How, Chief. I'm live here at
Yellowstone National Park,

00:33.883 --> 00:36.752
where a rare white buffalo
was born this morning.

00:36.753 --> 00:39.742
Tourists are pouring in to
see the adorable animal.

00:39.743 --> 00:42.625
This is just another
example of why Yellowstone

00:42.626 --> 00:45.428
is our country's greatest National Park.

00:45.429 --> 00:46.742
Son of a bitch!

00:47.506 --> 00:49.732
Hell yeah! Technology!

00:56.072 --> 00:58.532
<i>Brickleberry...</i>

01:03.413 --> 01:06.304
Yellowstone! Yellowstone! Humph!

01:06.305 --> 01:08.024
They've got a cute animal.

01:08.025 --> 01:11.194
They didn't have 25 campers
die in their Park this month.

01:11.195 --> 01:12.728
Blah blah blah.

01:12.729 --> 01:16.266
We shouldn't worry about Yellowstone.
We could just make some improvements.

01:16.267 --> 01:18.641
Here's one.

01:18.642 --> 01:22.472
We are done playing second fiddle
to that bastard Yellowstone!

01:22.473 --> 01:26.046
Malloy, if you'd only wear
your little birthday present,

01:26.047 --> 01:28.811
I'll bet tourists would
flock to see you too.

01:28.812 --> 01:32.482
I bet you'd like to see my tight
ass in that, you creepy pervert.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.317
Fine. Do you know what we're gonna do?

01:34.318 --> 01:35.751
Drown a homeless man?

01:35.752 --> 01:40.190
No, we're gonna find something even more
adorable than their shitty white buffalo.

01:40.191 --> 01:44.194
We shouldn't exploit animals for monetary
gain just because Yellowstone is.

01:44.195 --> 01:45.462
I agree with Ethel.

01:45.463 --> 01:48.931
So, who's gonna find me an animal
these dopey tourists can't resist?

01:48.932 --> 01:50.733
Not me. I hate animals.

01:50.734 --> 01:55.354
To be fair, most animals hate black people.

01:55.371 --> 01:57.831
And Mexicans.

01:57.874 --> 02:01.043
I would like to volunteer
to find the cutest animal ever.

02:01.044 --> 02:03.646
Shit. Anybody else?

02:03.647 --> 02:05.215
Anybody?

02:05.216 --> 02:07.984
Okay, Steve, just don't screw it up.

02:07.985 --> 02:10.907
Remember when you "volunteered"
at the retirement home?

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.006 --> 02:30.507
I'll show Woody.

02:30.508 --> 02:32.875
How hard could it be to find a cute animal?

02:32.876 --> 02:34.210
Let's see.

02:34.211 --> 02:37.331
Ugly, fat, too ethnic.

02:40.417 --> 02:41.518
Bingo.

02:41.519 --> 02:42.818
Excuse me, folks.

02:42.819 --> 02:44.687
Official Park business.

02:44.688 --> 02:46.045
Come here, you rascal.

02:46.046 --> 02:47.457
Excuse me, excuse me. Sorry, sorry.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.526
- Sorry, sorry.
- Get away from me!

02:49.527 --> 02:51.894
Sorry. Almost got it.

02:51.895 --> 02:54.564
Got it. Luckily, it got
caught in your panties.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.666
You folks have a nice day.

02:56.667 --> 02:59.068
Woody is going to love you.

02:59.069 --> 03:01.904
This is the most adorable animal ever.

03:01.905 --> 03:03.839
Look at you.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.076
My God, you are cute!

03:07.077 --> 03:09.145
Which is cuter? I don't know.

03:09.146 --> 03:10.465
The tourists loved the squirrel.

03:10.466 --> 03:12.882
The hiker, God rest her
soul, loved the rabbit.

03:12.883 --> 03:16.619
If only I could have both. But how?

03:24.562 --> 03:28.298
That's it! You guys just
need to each other.

03:33.704 --> 03:36.764
Okay, enough foreplay.

03:50.153 --> 03:54.053
Yes! Work it! Get in balls deep!

03:54.124 --> 03:56.226
Pound it! Pump it!

03:58.729 --> 04:01.676
All right, everybody, listen up.
I have an important announcement.

04:01.677 --> 04:06.569
This box I hold before you contains
the cutest animal on the planet.

04:06.570 --> 04:09.339
It's half squirrel, half rabbit.

04:09.340 --> 04:11.774
I call it the Squabbit.

04:11.775 --> 04:14.043
My God, my God, my God!

04:14.044 --> 04:17.194
So cute, I can't take my eyes off him.

04:17.195 --> 04:19.515
Have you ever seen a cuter animal?

04:19.516 --> 04:22.518
Look at that.
I just want to cuddle him.

04:22.519 --> 04:25.421
It's not that cute.
It's got those Taylor Swift teeth.

04:25.422 --> 04:27.423
How did you get a squirrel
and a rabbit to mate?

04:27.424 --> 04:30.123
The same way you get laid.
I dressed the squirrel up like a whore.

04:31.447 --> 04:33.796
- Dumb ass ho!
- Shut your mouth, Denzel.

04:33.797 --> 04:36.079
Listen, this whole thing
seems very wrong, Steve.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.434
She's got a point. It's not natural.

04:38.435 --> 04:40.995
It's like a freak of nature or something.

04:40.996 --> 04:42.505
Nah, that one's too easy.

04:42.506 --> 04:44.546
Woody, now I know what
you're thinking, but please

04:44.547 --> 04:46.342
don't make a spectacle of this poor animal.

04:46.343 --> 04:47.977
I would never do that.

05:00.424 --> 05:02.674
Wow, 40 million views.

05:02.675 --> 05:05.456
The Squabbit is the best
idea I've ever had.

05:05.457 --> 05:08.063
Well, actually, I kind of had the idea.

05:08.064 --> 05:10.566
Come on, Steve.
There's this new thing called modesty.

05:10.567 --> 05:12.201
You should try it sometime.

05:12.202 --> 05:13.903
Look, I get it.

05:13.904 --> 05:17.940
You want to be a part of team Squabbit,
well, I've got a special job for you.

05:17.941 --> 05:21.877
Picking up Squabbit shit.
It's everywhere. Check under the bed.

05:21.878 --> 05:24.433
Some of it's mine, but most of it's his.

05:24.434 --> 05:29.018
Hey, fella, who likes video games?
Here, you can have Malloy's.

05:29.019 --> 05:33.879
Gotta keep our new star
happy and entertained.

05:33.969 --> 05:36.492
What's that F.U. To God doing here?

05:36.493 --> 05:38.134
Who? He lives here.

05:38.135 --> 05:39.575
Well, now you have a choice to make,

05:39.576 --> 05:42.699
because I'm not gonna sleep under
the same roof as that thing.

06:12.363 --> 06:14.797
Denzel, what the hell are you doing?

06:14.798 --> 06:17.278
I printed some Squabbit merchandise
to make some extra money.

06:17.279 --> 06:18.901
You can't sell that stuff!

06:18.902 --> 06:22.405
The Squabbit is the sole property
of Brickleberry National Park.

06:22.406 --> 06:24.841
What, you got child support
payments or something?

06:24.842 --> 06:25.842
Man, that's racist.

06:25.843 --> 06:28.643
As a matter of fact, I've been saving
up for tickets to the symphony.

06:28.644 --> 06:30.497
- Really?
- Nah, I'm just messing with you.

06:30.498 --> 06:32.314
I got child support payments.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.420
Psst! Come here.

06:46.549 --> 06:48.984
I'm the cute guy here.

06:57.713 --> 07:01.143
What the... You won this round, Squabbit.

07:01.144 --> 07:04.647
Let's see how you handle "baked potato."

07:07.951 --> 07:13.051
I don't get it.
This worked on Woody's hamster.

07:19.696 --> 07:22.636
Why won't you die?

07:25.669 --> 07:27.970
It was that easy.

07:27.971 --> 07:30.706
My Squabbit! What did you do?

07:30.707 --> 07:32.374
You killed my Squabbit!

07:32.375 --> 07:34.444
I did not mean to kill him that time.

07:34.445 --> 07:37.613
Get out of my sight!
You're dead to me, bear cub!

07:37.614 --> 07:38.614
Get out!

07:38.615 --> 07:39.916
God.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.010
My little Squabbit.

07:42.011 --> 07:43.867
Why?

07:43.868 --> 07:45.788
Why!?

07:45.956 --> 07:48.346
Answer me, God!

07:48.347 --> 07:50.195
Why?

07:50.196 --> 07:54.816
Why do bad things happen to good Squabbits?

08:15.783 --> 08:18.184
What the... It's a miracle!

08:18.185 --> 08:20.192
Thanks, Jesus.

08:20.193 --> 08:23.073
Baby Squabbits?

08:23.074 --> 08:26.592
The Lord taketh and then
he giveth a shitload.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.873
Hallelujah!

08:29.602 --> 08:32.187
So you woke up and there
were six Squabbits?

08:32.188 --> 08:34.628
And this all started after Malloy
cut the first one in half?

08:34.629 --> 08:36.836
- Exactly.
- Where's Malloy?

08:36.837 --> 08:39.672
He's like my dead wife.
In the woods somewhere.

08:41.217 --> 08:44.438
What a rapid gestation period.
It must be their mutant DNA combin...

08:44.439 --> 08:46.441
Deh-deh-deh! Science!

08:46.442 --> 08:47.583
Shut up!

08:47.584 --> 08:49.014
Ethel's right.

08:49.015 --> 08:51.897
Aren't you concerned about how
fast they're reproducing?

08:51.898 --> 08:53.818
Yeah, of course you agree
with your girlfriend.

08:53.819 --> 08:56.889
I'm not concerned at all.
More Squabbits, more tourists.

08:56.890 --> 09:01.030
Mo tourists, mo money, right, Denzel?

09:01.318 --> 09:02.958
Where's Denzel?

09:02.959 --> 09:05.321
All right, which one you want?
I got, "I heart Squabbits,"

09:05.322 --> 09:08.953
"Squabbitude," "Rasta Squabbits,"
"Squabbit pissin' on a Jesus fish,"

09:08.954 --> 09:11.471
"Squabbits longer".
What you want? I got it.

09:11.472 --> 09:13.172
I'll take that one in white.

09:13.173 --> 09:14.470
Denzel!

09:14.471 --> 09:15.611
Shit!

09:17.087 --> 09:18.948
Yo, be cool. It's my boss man.

09:18.949 --> 09:20.554
Look, more Squabbits!

09:20.555 --> 09:23.082
We're gonna need extra crowd
control for tomorrow.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.958
That's cool, man.

09:24.959 --> 09:27.775
Yeah, I was just about to give
these folks a tour of,

09:27.776 --> 09:30.106
That dirt road that's too small for cars.

09:30.107 --> 09:31.680
You mean the hiking trail?

09:31.681 --> 09:33.259
Yeah, the hyper-sail. Whatever.

09:33.260 --> 09:36.330
Okay, get back to work then.

09:36.331 --> 09:38.812
Don't worry. I'll take care of that.

09:39.933 --> 09:43.364
So, let's see, you owe me 10 for
the shirt and 5 for the finger.

09:44.929 --> 09:48.280
Who needs Woody?
I can make it in the forest.

09:48.281 --> 09:50.145
I'm a bear!

09:50.146 --> 09:53.775
Siri, I need to
schedule a hot stone massage.

09:53.776 --> 09:55.948
Hey there, brother bear.

09:55.949 --> 09:59.018
Looks like I found myself a new friend.

09:59.019 --> 10:02.688
New record. Three seconds,
and I already hate you.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.640
Gosh, are you having a
bad day or something?

10:05.641 --> 10:07.309
Does a bear shit in the woods?

10:07.310 --> 10:08.469
Yes, we do.

10:09.589 --> 10:11.823
I always thought that
was just an expression.

10:11.824 --> 10:13.733
I hope to God you guys have baby wipes.

10:13.734 --> 10:15.724
No.

10:15.725 --> 10:18.703
So you just use dry toilet paper?

10:18.704 --> 10:21.316
Now, what the heck is toilet paper?

10:21.317 --> 10:23.874
You are a nasty bastard.

10:34.543 --> 10:37.757
Isn't it great? We're charging double
for admission, and they're paying it!

10:38.759 --> 10:40.276
Stupid suckers!

10:41.514 --> 10:44.434
Woody, these Squabbits have eaten
nearly all the vegetation in the Park.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.998
- We have to get...
- Look at this.

10:45.999 --> 10:48.601
20 bucks at the gift shop.

10:48.602 --> 10:51.203
- Man, I sell those for ten.
- Ten?

10:51.204 --> 10:54.941
Overpopulation of one species
is a problem, Woody.

10:55.976 --> 10:57.710
Yeah, I know. So is your camel toe.

11:02.215 --> 11:05.985
I'm standing here with Woody
Johnson, creator of the Squabbit.

11:05.986 --> 11:09.996
As far as I'm concerned, there
can never be too many Squabbits.

11:09.997 --> 11:13.970
And I'd like you to make love
to me, right now, on the air.

11:13.971 --> 11:15.444
Well, all right.

11:17.163 --> 11:19.743
What the...

11:20.322 --> 11:22.702
You are the smartest man on Earth.

11:24.505 --> 11:26.866
Here's $3 million in pennies.

11:26.867 --> 11:28.417
And a Nobel Prize.

11:28.418 --> 11:31.268
I know. I'm great! See, Malloy?

11:31.269 --> 11:34.514
I was right, you were wrong. Admit it.

11:42.055 --> 11:44.156
I'm okay.

11:44.157 --> 11:46.353
It was just another wet dream.

11:58.461 --> 12:00.261
Ah!

12:01.575 --> 12:03.308
Listen up.

12:03.309 --> 12:05.778
We've got too many goddamn Squabbits!

12:05.779 --> 12:07.914
The tourists can't even get in the gates.

12:07.915 --> 12:10.683
Damn you, Steve, this was
all your stupid idea!

12:10.684 --> 12:12.953
Thank you. It's about time
I got a little credit.

12:12.954 --> 12:15.933
I am declaring open season on Squabbits!

12:15.934 --> 12:20.326
I want every poacher in the state here
to shoot, stab, run over, decapitate,

12:20.327 --> 12:22.595
eat, kick, or fist those little bastards.

12:22.596 --> 12:24.296
Or we could just relocate them.

12:24.297 --> 12:25.998
We're gonna relocate 'em, all right.

12:25.999 --> 12:28.034
To hell!

12:28.035 --> 12:30.469
Everybody grab some ammo.
It's killing time!

12:30.470 --> 12:33.372
I'm great at killing time.

12:33.373 --> 12:35.479
- No, you can't just kill them.
- Yeah, Woody.

12:35.480 --> 12:38.444
Spoken like a couple of
dopey liberal broads.

12:38.445 --> 12:42.772
I don't know what bleeds more...
Your hearts or your parts.

12:42.773 --> 12:44.442
We have to stop that maniac.

12:44.443 --> 12:48.454
How? He doesn't like to be
bothered during killing time.

12:51.959 --> 12:54.255
Are you sure that's a good idea?

12:54.256 --> 12:57.749
I mean, it's your idea, so it...
It's gotta be good.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.329
- You're pretty.
- What?

12:59.330 --> 13:01.734
I want to wear your ass like a fake beard.

13:01.735 --> 13:04.686
- What?
- Nothing.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.760
Who's ready for dinner?

13:14.761 --> 13:17.341
No way! Honey!

13:17.443 --> 13:20.435
Guys, I'm allergic to bees, and
I didn't bring my Epi-pen.

13:20.436 --> 13:22.237
Yummy to my bear tummy!

13:22.238 --> 13:24.347
You're having honey for dinner?

13:24.348 --> 13:26.908
It's a goddamn condiment!

13:30.613 --> 13:32.547
Wow, these things are hard to kill.

13:32.548 --> 13:35.116
We'll see about that.

13:35.117 --> 13:38.587
- Stop in the name of pita!
- Great, pita.

13:38.588 --> 13:41.155
- Peta?
- No, pita with an "I."

13:41.156 --> 13:44.092
It's a completely different organization.

13:44.093 --> 13:47.095
I don't know what you heard, but we
haven't harmed a single Squabbit.

13:53.402 --> 13:54.603
What, you like the duds?

13:54.604 --> 13:58.684
I'll give you a good deal on one.

14:00.265 --> 14:03.645
I knew it! We forbid you from
harming one more Squabbit!

14:03.646 --> 14:05.332
And who's gonna stop us?

14:05.333 --> 14:09.150
You and a bunch of picketing
pita pussies? Puhh!

14:09.151 --> 14:11.720
Commence operation... Squabbit Storm.

14:20.429 --> 14:22.013
You have a whole army?

14:22.014 --> 14:25.767
What do you think we spend our money on?
Starving children? That would be a waste.

14:26.769 --> 14:28.670
Now, just stay cool.

14:28.671 --> 14:31.539
Nobody's gonna hurt any animals here.

14:33.276 --> 14:35.986
It was just a cockroach.

14:41.536 --> 14:42.962
No!

14:42.963 --> 14:45.267
Wait. Who the hell was that guy?

14:49.298 --> 14:52.997
You have sinned against the animal
kingdom, an act punishable by death.

14:52.998 --> 14:56.469
We're Park rangers. Everything we do
at this Park is to keep animals safe.

14:56.470 --> 14:59.372
Yeah! Get him! Bite that mother!

14:59.373 --> 15:02.237
Woo! I won! Give me my goddamn money.

15:15.217 --> 15:17.485
This isn't that bad. What is this?

15:17.486 --> 15:19.387
A beaver's asshole.

15:25.260 --> 15:27.161
This is a low point.

15:31.367 --> 15:34.933
Wow, thank you. You saved my life.
I do not know how I could repa...

15:34.934 --> 15:36.471
Hold on.

15:36.472 --> 15:40.852
O-m-f-g. I miss u. Emoticon sad face.

15:41.522 --> 15:44.713
I never r-o-t-f-l-m-f-a-o anymore.

15:44.714 --> 15:47.382
I less-than sign three you.

15:47.383 --> 15:51.440
If you want to make out,
I'm gay if you are.

15:51.441 --> 15:54.723
No! I mean, if you
want to make up, I'm game if you are.

15:54.724 --> 15:56.190
Goddamn auto correct!

16:23.035 --> 16:25.170
Okay, you lowlife humans!

16:25.171 --> 16:28.877
Prepare to meet your demise in
the most unethical way possible.

16:28.878 --> 16:30.725
Death by cosmetic testing!

16:30.726 --> 16:33.395
What are you gonna do, put makeup on us?

16:34.993 --> 16:37.866
- My God!
- That was horrible!

16:37.867 --> 16:40.836
Everything's fuzzy. Can you see?
I can't feel my lips.

16:40.837 --> 16:43.436
It stings.

16:43.437 --> 16:44.795
I didn't think it was that bad.

16:44.796 --> 16:47.592
They shoved lipstick up
my goddamn dick hole!

16:47.593 --> 16:50.205
Me too. Normally I have
to pay 50 bucks for that.

16:50.206 --> 16:54.048
All right, it's time to finish you off.

17:03.726 --> 17:07.094
I am honored to die to give you sustenance.

17:07.095 --> 17:09.915
I still love you.

17:15.762 --> 17:18.999
- Now it's our chance to get out of here!
- Anyone know how to pick a lock?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.619
Allow me.

17:24.805 --> 17:26.705
Ah-ah-ah.

17:34.294 --> 17:38.493
We'll be safe up here.
Those stupid Squabbits can't climb.

17:38.494 --> 17:41.455
What are they doing?

17:41.456 --> 17:42.976
Learning.

17:50.231 --> 17:52.364
- Screw it.
- Connie, what are you doing?

17:52.365 --> 17:54.689
I thought you loved
animals as much as I do!

17:54.690 --> 17:56.051
Not really.

17:56.052 --> 17:57.940
I thought it would make you go down on me.

17:57.941 --> 18:03.101
I mean, like me.
We can talk about it later.

18:05.613 --> 18:08.348
It didn't kill them!
It didn't kill a single one of them!

18:08.349 --> 18:10.550
They're impenetrable from the outside.

18:10.551 --> 18:13.084
Maybe we need to attack
them from the inside.

18:13.085 --> 18:15.097
Like feeding them poisoned food.

18:15.098 --> 18:19.191
They ain't touching those dead bodies.
They only eat living things, like us.

18:19.192 --> 18:22.929
Where are we gonna find a
living thing so toxic,

18:22.930 --> 18:26.325
so vile, so afflicted by a disease,

18:26.326 --> 18:29.567
that it could wipe out
an entire population?

18:29.568 --> 18:32.792
Hello! Sorry I'm late, guys.

18:32.793 --> 18:34.792
- Pamela Anderson?
- Jackpot!

18:34.793 --> 18:37.905
What's that skinny old man
with the tit job doing here?

18:43.933 --> 18:46.514
Winnie the Pooh never had
to deal with this bullshit.

18:49.298 --> 18:51.624
You can do this. You're a bear.

18:51.625 --> 18:56.177
Just remember what those jamboree
bumpkins taught you out in the woods.

18:56.178 --> 18:58.638
Grrr-owwwwwl.

19:00.834 --> 19:03.703
Okay, who ordered the hot stone massage?

19:05.165 --> 19:07.658
Thank you, Siri.

19:07.659 --> 19:10.479
That will be $80.

19:14.782 --> 19:18.181
So, how are we gonna trick her into
feeding herself to the Squabbits?

19:18.182 --> 19:21.455
Can we get through one emergency where
you guys don't put on a drag show?

19:21.456 --> 19:24.357
Malloy! Sweet Dick Eisenhower!

19:24.358 --> 19:26.493
Thank God you're here, little buddy.

19:26.494 --> 19:28.287
Okay, I'm ignoring Ziggy Stardust.

19:28.288 --> 19:30.168
Somebody else want to
tell me what's going on?

19:30.169 --> 19:33.804
I know it's crazy, but hear me out.
We have to kill Pam Anderson because...

19:33.805 --> 19:34.638
I'm in.

19:34.639 --> 19:37.309
Okay, we know she's
infatuated with cute animals,

19:37.310 --> 19:40.566
but in order for this to work, we
need something extraordinarily cute.

19:40.567 --> 19:42.498
I've got an idea.

19:45.813 --> 19:47.973
So cute!

19:48.144 --> 19:50.604
Need to hug.

20:02.829 --> 20:05.098
Malloy, you did it!

20:05.099 --> 20:06.878
Yeah, we can't forget to thank Steve,

20:06.879 --> 20:09.736
the fat moron who made these
things in the first place.

20:11.904 --> 20:14.017
Steve, o-m-f-g!

20:29.783 --> 20:33.226
Congratulations, rangers.
Killin' time was a huge success.

20:33.227 --> 20:34.927
All the Squabbits are dead.

20:34.928 --> 20:38.898
Well, too bad we don't have an
animal to attract tourists anymore.

20:38.899 --> 20:42.169
Don't worry, Woody.
I've created a much safer animal.

20:42.170 --> 20:44.583
I give you the wolverinigator.

20:50.824 --> 20:52.511
Don't move!

20:52.512 --> 20:54.747
He smells fear!
