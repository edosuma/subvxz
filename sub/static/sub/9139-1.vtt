You're killing him.

Ooh.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.265
All right.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.768
Ahhh.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.804
Ahh. dinner.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.976
Sure put up
a big fight

02:22.976 --> 02:25.179

a little guy.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.883
Hey, don't give me
that sad look.

02:32.186 --> 02:35.189
Don't tell any
of your friends
i did that.

02:35.189 --> 02:37.791
Don't let me catch you
out here again.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.760
What a sucker!

02:42.129 --> 02:44.598
I see you still got
that killer instinct.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.334
How'd you find me,
Burt?

02:46.334 --> 02:49.337
I'm in the security
business now.
It's my job.

02:49.337 --> 02:52.206
O.k., o.K., your mom
told me, all right?

02:52.206 --> 02:54.208
I'm glad you're so
thrilled to see me

02:54.208 --> 02:55.476
after all
these years.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.811
Do you mind
if I make myself
comfortable

02:57.811 --> 02:59.112
on this
filthy crate?

02:59.112 --> 03:00.113
Suit yourself.

03:00.113 --> 03:02.616
Look, I just
got a call

03:02.616 --> 03:04.618
from a major,
major new client

03:04.618 --> 03:07.555
looking for a bodyguard.
I thought of you first.

03:07.555 --> 03:08.589
Forget it.

03:08.589 --> 03:11.225
I'm not a bodyguard.
I'm a wrestler, o.K.?

03:11.225 --> 03:12.660
Hey, wait, wa--

03:12.660 --> 03:13.694
I am a wrestler.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.929
I managed you
for 15 years.
Remember?

03:15.929 --> 03:18.899
Or did you get
head-slammed
too many times?

03:18.899 --> 03:21.635
Listen to me.
You'll make
some big bucks,

03:21.635 --> 03:24.238
and it'll get you
out of the ring.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.639
Forget it, Burt.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.908
Still having
those nightmares?

03:29.410 --> 03:31.245
Yeah, sometimes.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.080
So why'd
you pick me?

03:33.080 --> 03:35.783
'Cause I love you
like a son...

03:35.783 --> 03:37.985
And nobody else
will work for me.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.820
So what
did you do now?

03:39.820 --> 03:42.256
Man, it's crazy.
You bounce a few checks,

03:42.256 --> 03:44.258
and right away
you're a deadbeat.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.659
Remember the time
in Reno

03:45.659 --> 03:48.061
when the hotel
locked up our clothes

03:48.061 --> 03:52.065
and I had to sneak
down the fire escape
in a towel?

03:52.065 --> 03:55.269
Yeah! we had some
fun times then,
didn't we?

03:55.269 --> 03:56.470
Nope.

03:56.470 --> 03:59.607
I got a bum leg
since I took
a bullet

03:59.607 --> 04:00.908
for some big
lunkhead.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.377
Hey, wait. It was
meant for you,
wasn't it?

04:03.377 --> 04:05.513
O.k.,
i owe you my life.

04:05.513 --> 04:07.515
I still ain't
taking the gig.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.517
Sure, you'd help
some slimy fish,

04:09.517 --> 04:11.385
but the guy that
saved your life--

04:11.385 --> 04:12.853
that's gratitude
for you.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.087
Just forget it.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.324
Let me explain
how it works.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.728
Ahh.

04:23.030 --> 04:24.432
Want to know my secret?

04:24.432 --> 04:27.768
I cook it in the can.

04:28.869 --> 04:29.737
Mmm.

04:29.737 --> 04:32.873
Out of the can
and into the man.

04:33.741 --> 04:37.144
How long's it been
since you ate?

04:37.144 --> 04:39.347
Just a week.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.382
Here.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.686
Tell you what...

04:45.686 --> 04:49.256
Fill in the amount
and pay me back
when you can.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.459
I don't want
your damn charity.

04:51.459 --> 04:54.595
I need a job,
not a handout.

04:54.595 --> 04:58.265
If I get this gig,
I'm back in business.

04:58.265 --> 05:01.268
One thing I still got,
my self-respect.

05:01.268 --> 05:02.870
I ain't going to beg.

05:02.870 --> 05:03.771
Yeah.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.673
Although it always
worked before...

05:05.673 --> 05:07.441

please, man.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.719
Oh, man, this is
such an emotional moment.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.655

06:09.369 --> 06:11.905

fourth word in.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.509

where's the bodyguard?

06:15.509 --> 06:18.779

Get off the bike.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.484
Gorillas, huh?

06:57.651 --> 07:00.721

have done that.

Hey, you!

07:20.307 --> 07:22.442
Wrong. he's incredible.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.778

07:30.918 --> 07:33.887
So where's
Mason's office?

07:33.887 --> 07:37.491
I bet you've been

head of security.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.788

your new computer chip--

the one for
the peacefinder.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.801
I told you
it's not for sale.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.770
Everything's for sale.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.339
The question is only
at what price.

08:26.339 --> 08:30.544
You have 24 hours
to reconsider.

of your lovely children.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.216

08:36.216 --> 08:37.684

the police?

08:37.684 --> 08:40.453

This man
assaulted me!

08:40.453 --> 08:41.789
Quiet. no police!

08:41.789 --> 08:43.857
If word gets out about
this peacefinder project,

08:43.857 --> 08:45.859
we'll have
every crackpot
after us.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.294
What's the peacefinder
project?

08:47.294 --> 08:48.696
I'm sorry.
That's top-secret.

08:48.696 --> 08:50.698
I'm putting my life
on the line.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.299
Tell me, or I'm gone.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.034
Well, nice meeting you.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.268
O.k., Sean, o.K.,

08:55.268 --> 08:59.707
but you've got to
keep this strictly
confidential.

08:59.707 --> 09:00.941
Know anything
about chips?

09:00.941 --> 09:03.376
I'm a nacho cheese man
myself.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.178
I was referring
to silicon chips.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.781
He doesn't know
anything about chips, sir.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.917
He's only the bodyguard.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.352
I know a microchip
is a wafer

09:12.352 --> 09:13.754
of the chemical element
silicon

09:13.754 --> 09:15.255
serving as
a semiconductor

09:15.255 --> 09:17.658
under which a series
of electrical circuits
are printed.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.126
Very good.

09:19.126 --> 09:22.996
Did you know
that the chip itself
costs only pennies?

09:22.996 --> 09:25.999
But the information
on this one
is worth millions.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.335
It's the only one
in existence.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.737
You invented it?

09:29.737 --> 09:32.740
No. I have
a company to run.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.675
I was an inventor,
though.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.945
I started this place
in my garage.
Come on.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.616
This is a model
of the peacefinder.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.618
With our chip,
this can shoot down

09:44.618 --> 09:47.220
any missile fired
by any country.

09:47.220 --> 09:48.021
Cool.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.023
It'll make
people think twice

09:50.023 --> 09:52.192
before they start
another war.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.193
Real cool.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.762
Yeah.

09:54.762 --> 09:58.365
Come on. I will
tell you about
your assignment.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.468
So I'm supposed
to guard the chip?

10:35.468 --> 10:38.105
Not exactly.
You're supposed
to guard my kids.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.573
Are you crazy?
I hate kids.

10:40.573 --> 10:41.975
The children
have a nanny.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.576
You just protect them.

10:43.576 --> 10:44.978
I'll find someone else,
sir.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.980
Obviously, he's
not up for it.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.582
I didn't say
i couldn't do it...

10:49.582 --> 10:53.286
I mean, as long as
they got a nanny.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.693
Ah! aah!

11:33.693 --> 11:35.228
Aah! ah!

11:35.228 --> 11:36.764

was that?

was last week.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.619
Oh, right.
The broken leg.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.054

12:01.054 --> 12:03.256
Miss kopalski
had a short circuit

12:03.256 --> 12:04.557
in her blow dryer.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.893
This is
very bad.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.295

won't send any
more nannies.

Babysitting was not
part of our deal.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.422
You can make the difference.

30:56.422 --> 30:59.391
This family needs a change.
Maybe it's you.

30:59.391 --> 31:00.459
You think so?

31:00.459 --> 31:02.128
No, not really.

31:02.128 --> 31:04.363
But, hey,
it's worth a shot.

31:04.363 --> 31:07.733
So get tough.
Hang in there.
Suck it up.

31:07.733 --> 31:10.136
I've been
sucking it up.

31:10.136 --> 31:12.438
Here.
have some more.

31:14.340 --> 31:15.942
Thanks.

31:17.243 --> 31:20.846
Wow. imagine what he
could do to your head.

31:20.846 --> 31:21.880
[Door closes]

31:21.880 --> 31:23.983
Alex? Kate? I'm home.

31:23.983 --> 31:25.751
We're in the gym, dad!

31:25.751 --> 31:28.187
Wait till he
sees what we did.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.157
Hi.

31:35.761 --> 31:36.963
What happened?

31:36.963 --> 31:38.764
We destroyed the bike,
wrecked the room,

31:38.764 --> 31:40.166
and almost killed Sean.

31:40.166 --> 31:42.168
Yeah! are you
going to punish us?

31:42.168 --> 31:44.370
This is a new approach.

31:44.370 --> 31:45.704
Well, what for?

31:45.704 --> 31:49.208
Sean's fine,
and there's nothing here
that can't be fixed.

31:49.208 --> 31:50.943
I got to make some calls.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.478
What?

31:52.478 --> 31:53.279
What?

31:53.279 --> 31:55.614
Case closed.
Now excuse me.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.183
Excuse me,
Mr. Mason.

31:57.183 --> 31:59.318
You're not going
to do anything?

31:59.318 --> 32:01.187
No time to discuss
this, Sean.

32:01.187 --> 32:03.622
And you wonder why
your kids are a mess.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.024
You can't say that.

32:05.024 --> 32:08.194
You don't know what it's
like raising kids alone.

32:08.194 --> 32:10.997
I feel sorry you lost
your wife, man,

32:10.997 --> 32:16.668
but if you can't give
these kids what they
need, get rid of them.

32:18.204 --> 32:21.407
I guess he really
doesn't care about us.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.419
[Muffled shouts]

32:35.287 --> 32:37.423
O.k.

32:37.423 --> 32:38.424
All right.

32:38.424 --> 32:39.825
Here we go. O.K.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.427
Come on, baby.

32:41.427 --> 32:43.562
5...9, 8, 7.

32:44.830 --> 32:45.864
Holy...

32:45.864 --> 32:48.234
It's o.K. I'll
just clear this.

32:48.234 --> 32:49.935
No problem.
No problema.

32:49.935 --> 32:51.337
4, 5, 6, uh...

32:51.337 --> 32:54.840
9, 8, 7.
That's the one.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.642
Oh, jeez. Clear.
It's o.K.

32:56.642 --> 32:59.245
Damn it! He's changed
the combination.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.847
This is becoming
tiresome, frank.

33:01.847 --> 33:03.249
I'll do it
again.

33:03.249 --> 33:05.851
I'm beginning
to get a headache.

33:05.851 --> 33:08.587

aah, aah!

33:23.001 --> 33:24.002
Very stupid!

33:24.002 --> 33:27.373
Now I'm getting
a migraine!

33:27.373 --> 33:30.276
Do not worry,
herr thanatos.

33:41.887 --> 33:43.289
It's empty,
frank.

33:43.289 --> 33:46.125
Why am I not
surprised?

33:46.125 --> 33:47.893
Uh, he--he--he--

33:47.893 --> 33:50.296
he must have
taken it with him.

33:50.296 --> 33:52.898
This was not my idea--
your plan, sir.

are going to be here.

You, with the vest,

33:58.304 --> 34:01.773
can you give me a little
love pat right here?

34:01.773 --> 34:02.908
With pleasure.

34:02.908 --> 34:04.510
No, no, Wolfie,
it's o.K.

34:07.813 --> 34:10.181
Oh, my head!

34:10.181 --> 34:12.518
Oh, my head!

34:12.518 --> 34:14.520
The pressure!

The pressure!

34:20.058 --> 34:22.494
Ahh, ahh...

34:22.494 --> 34:25.063
The pressure. The pressure.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.533
[School bell rings]

34:38.944 --> 34:40.346
Mason, where
you going?

34:40.346 --> 34:42.114
We were looking
for you.

34:42.114 --> 34:44.750
Gee. is it 3:00
already?

34:44.750 --> 34:46.652
Shut up, dweeb.

34:46.652 --> 34:49.388
Alex, we missed you
this morning.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.389
Didn't you hear us
calling?

34:51.389 --> 34:53.559
Oh, was that you guys?

34:53.559 --> 34:54.826
Hand it over.

34:54.826 --> 34:57.696
I spent my money
on lunch!

Ow!

34:59.931 --> 35:02.968
Mason, Mason.
You weren't
straight with us.

35:02.968 --> 35:05.371
That'll cost you
50 bucks.

35:05.371 --> 35:07.973
Then we can be
friends again.

35:07.973 --> 35:09.375
I hate bullies.

35:09.375 --> 35:11.377
You'll only
make it worse.

35:11.377 --> 35:13.579
How often
does this happen?

35:13.579 --> 35:15.314
Just once a day.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.252
What a wimp.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.953
You said it.

to kick their butts?

he's sensitive.

happened back there.

own business!

to defend yourself.

to be so mean.

it's all right
if they hate you

not their father.

they'll respect you.

respect anybody.

Look, if you're getting
ready for a fight,

42:20.138 --> 42:22.574
all you need is attitude,
not muscles.

for you to say

when you're the
size of a redwood.

but I got whupped
every day.

to take care of myself.

42:35.621 --> 42:39.224
How'd you get them to
stop beating on you?

42:39.224 --> 42:40.358
I graduated.

42:40.358 --> 42:41.760
Oh.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.529
Then this little guy Burt
taught me attitude.

42:44.529 --> 42:46.965
And the rest is history.

42:51.369 --> 42:53.371
O.k. teach me.

42:53.371 --> 42:54.873
Please.

42:57.976 --> 42:59.778
Feet apart.

42:59.778 --> 43:01.379
Weight forward.

43:01.379 --> 43:03.649
No. try again.
You're too tight.

43:03.649 --> 43:05.583
Remember--
loose, but ready.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.385
O.k. loose,
but ready.

43:07.385 --> 43:08.586
Got it.

43:10.388 --> 43:12.057
Attaboy.

43:12.057 --> 43:13.792
No. somebody swings,
you're dead.

43:13.792 --> 43:15.794
Drop your hands
by your side,

43:15.794 --> 43:17.763
relax
your shoulders.

43:18.797 --> 43:20.832
I just feel
a little awkward.

43:20.832 --> 43:23.401
I know,
but nobody else will.

43:23.401 --> 43:25.003
Remember...

43:25.003 --> 43:26.004
You're bad!

43:27.005 --> 43:28.006
I'm bad.

43:28.006 --> 43:29.007
Yeah.

43:29.007 --> 43:29.808
I'm bad!

43:29.808 --> 43:31.442
I'm super bad!

43:31.442 --> 43:32.443
I'm badacious!

43:32.443 --> 43:33.444
All right!

43:33.444 --> 43:34.445
Yeah!

43:34.445 --> 43:35.446
Bad!

43:35.446 --> 43:36.815
* attitude, dude **

43:36.815 --> 43:39.785
wait a minute.
Where are you going?

* in my bed *

43:42.988 --> 43:46.391

44:01.639 --> 44:02.874

44:03.842 --> 44:05.643
It's just me.

44:07.545 --> 44:09.715
I can't sleep.

44:09.715 --> 44:11.983
Do whatever you
did last night.

44:11.983 --> 44:14.185
I couldn't sleep then,
either.

44:19.457 --> 44:22.060
You must have
slept sometime.

44:22.060 --> 44:24.062
Yeah.

44:24.062 --> 44:25.463
Sure.

44:25.463 --> 44:27.866
When my mommy was here...

44:27.866 --> 44:30.535
Before she went to heaven.

44:30.535 --> 44:32.070
Oh.

44:39.477 --> 44:41.880
You know...

44:41.880 --> 44:45.283
I lost my dad
when I was a kid.

44:45.283 --> 44:48.353
But I don't think
he went to heaven.

44:48.353 --> 44:50.956
You mean he went to...

44:54.492 --> 44:55.827
Oh.

44:57.495 --> 44:59.898
Mommy used
to sing me a song.

44:59.898 --> 45:02.067
Could you sing it to me?

45:02.067 --> 45:05.536
I don't know
those kind of songs.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.773
I could teach it
to you.

45:07.773 --> 45:10.675
* speed, Bonnie boat *

45:10.675 --> 45:13.979
* like a bird

45:32.764 --> 45:34.132
hey, wake up!

45:34.132 --> 45:35.733
I'm awake.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.735
Then sing.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.537
I got
a terrible voice.

45:39.537 --> 45:41.840
Sing!

45:41.840 --> 45:43.141
All right.

45:43.141 --> 45:46.344
But I got to
sing my own song.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.481
* twinkle, twinkle *

45:50.481 --> 45:52.050

46:18.776 --> 46:21.379

you doing here?

46:21.379 --> 46:22.380
[Mumbling]

46:24.515 --> 46:25.616
"Extra security."

46:25.616 --> 46:28.786
Good, good.
Is Harry in the limo?

46:28.786 --> 46:30.788
[Mumbling]

46:30.788 --> 46:32.790
"Harry is sick."

46:32.790 --> 46:34.192
You know, that's odd.

46:34.192 --> 46:36.794
Usually, Harry
calls me himself.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.196
[Mumbling]

46:38.196 --> 46:41.199
Oh, your anticipation
is impressive.

46:41.199 --> 46:44.402
"Blew his lunch
in the garage."

46:45.803 --> 46:48.006
O.k. I'll get my bags.

46:49.174 --> 46:51.009
[Humming]

46:55.813 --> 46:57.415
It worked.

46:57.415 --> 46:59.417
You have to kiss Dolly.

46:59.417 --> 47:01.219
I don't kiss dollies.

47:01.219 --> 47:04.022
You're going
to wake me up!

47:06.824 --> 47:08.894
Don't tell anybody
i did that.

47:08.894 --> 47:13.331
Dolly likes you.
Would you take care
of her for the night?

47:13.331 --> 47:14.332
No way.

47:14.332 --> 47:15.833
What?

47:15.833 --> 47:17.435
All right.
All right.

47:40.091 --> 47:43.061
Uh...let me
see the doll.

47:44.862 --> 47:47.465
What, you want
to kiss her, too?

47:47.465 --> 47:48.466
What?

47:48.466 --> 47:50.468
Oh, you mean for Kate.

47:50.468 --> 47:52.170
It sure wasn't for me.

47:52.170 --> 47:55.240
Sean, I didn't get
a chance to say goodbye,

47:55.240 --> 47:57.875
so could you tell
the children I love them?

47:57.875 --> 48:00.478
Why don't you tell them?

48:00.478 --> 48:01.846
You mean right now?

48:01.846 --> 48:03.881
You got something
more important to do?

48:03.881 --> 48:07.085
Yes, as a matter
of fact, i--

48:09.487 --> 48:10.888
no, I don't.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.190
Good.
but don't forget,

48:12.190 --> 48:14.292
this may be
where it starts,

48:14.292 --> 48:16.394
but it ain't
where it ends.

48:36.381 --> 48:37.515
[Knock on door]

48:37.515 --> 48:38.349
[Door opens]

48:38.349 --> 48:40.918
Sean, I was thinking
we could--

48:40.918 --> 48:42.520
oh, hi, dad.

48:42.520 --> 48:44.322
What are you doing here?

48:44.322 --> 48:47.758
I'm saying good night.
Is that so surprising?

48:47.758 --> 48:50.328
Well, frankly, yes.

48:54.332 --> 48:59.137
Gee, my old workplace
looks great with your
inventions on it.

49:01.139 --> 49:04.142
You know,
i really miss it.

49:13.351 --> 49:15.353
I can't make up
for the past,

49:15.353 --> 49:18.956
but I'm going to change,
Alex. I promise.

49:18.956 --> 49:20.358
I can help

49:20.358 --> 49:23.961
if you just listen
to me once in a while.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.163
O.k.?

49:26.964 --> 49:29.967
I love you, Alex.

49:29.967 --> 49:32.170
I love you, too.

49:37.975 --> 49:39.177
Mr. Mason?

49:39.977 --> 49:41.379
Sorry to bother you,

49:41.379 --> 49:44.982
but I'm supposed to take
care of Dolly tonight.

49:44.982 --> 49:47.985
Well, take very
good care of her.

49:47.985 --> 49:48.986
You bet.

49:48.986 --> 49:49.987
Yeah.

49:49.987 --> 49:52.590
Sean...

49:52.590 --> 49:54.325
Thanks for everything.

50:00.598 --> 50:01.599
Katie?

50:09.607 --> 50:11.008
I love you, Katie.

50:11.008 --> 50:12.610
Again.

50:16.514 --> 50:18.015
I love you, Katie.

50:18.015 --> 50:21.886
I've never
stopped loving you.

I love you, daddy.

He missed the turn
to the airport. Driver!

50:45.009 --> 50:48.246
Sit back.
Enjoy the ride.

50:48.246 --> 50:51.816
Herr thanatos
has planned a full
evening for you.

50:51.816 --> 50:56.087
Thanatos? is--is that
the sicko who's been--

50:56.887 --> 50:58.189
oh, god.

50:58.189 --> 51:01.626
Oh, frank! Frank!
Don't just sit there. Frank!

51:06.431 --> 51:08.633
"I work for Mr. thanatos."

51:08.633 --> 51:10.635
How could you do that?

51:13.571 --> 51:15.240
Money? you fool!

51:15.240 --> 51:20.245
He'll get rid of you
the moment you've
outlived your usefulness!

"Ha!"

I'm coming.

51:38.996 --> 51:40.731
[Pounding louder]

51:40.731 --> 51:42.733

51:45.503 --> 51:46.504
Oh!

51:46.504 --> 51:48.105
Mama!

51:48.105 --> 51:51.108
How would you like
that cane up your nose?

51:51.108 --> 51:52.109
Sean!

51:52.109 --> 51:53.278
Hey, Burt.

51:53.278 --> 51:56.113
Hey, great to see you,
too, old buddy.

51:56.113 --> 51:59.284
Hey, give me 20 bucks
for the cabbie, quick.

52:00.084 --> 52:01.152
Hey.

52:01.152 --> 52:03.020
Keep the change.

52:03.020 --> 52:06.257
Gee...a whole quarter.

52:06.257 --> 52:07.258
A quarter!

52:07.258 --> 52:08.859
Give me that.

52:08.859 --> 52:10.528
This ain't Christmas.

52:11.362 --> 52:13.964
Ha ha!
So, who's the babe?

52:13.964 --> 52:15.766
Corinne,
meet my pal Burt.

52:15.766 --> 52:19.103
Ooh,
the dynamic duo--
wimpy and gimpy.

52:19.103 --> 52:21.672
She's in
a good mood today.

52:23.107 --> 52:24.509
Who's this?

52:24.509 --> 52:26.977
Alex, Kate.
Burt Wilson.

52:26.977 --> 52:28.646
Ah, the brats.

52:28.646 --> 52:31.482
You're too old
for a bodyguard.

52:31.482 --> 52:33.784
You're too little to have
such a big mouth.

52:33.784 --> 52:37.388
I hope you're giving us
a golden-age discount,
gramps.

52:37.388 --> 52:39.123
Kids,
show some respect.

52:39.123 --> 52:40.525
Burt saved my life.

52:40.525 --> 52:43.261
That's right.
Took a bullet right here

52:43.261 --> 52:45.095
for this guy,
nicked an artery.

52:45.095 --> 52:47.532
You should've seen
the blood pumping out.

52:47.532 --> 52:50.067
Kaploom! kaploom! Kaploom!
Nearly hit the ceiling.

52:50.067 --> 52:51.802
Eww!cool!

52:51.802 --> 52:55.005
A long time ago,
this creep named
Tommy thanatos,

52:55.005 --> 52:57.408
he tried to get
me and Burt

52:57.408 --> 53:00.144
to rig a prestigious
sporting event.

53:00.144 --> 53:01.379
The world
series?

53:01.379 --> 53:04.549
Close. anyway,
me and Burt refused.

53:04.549 --> 53:07.151
Thanatos lost
a lot of money.

53:07.151 --> 53:08.553
And then
after the event...

53:08.553 --> 53:10.555
Ahh. nice match, champ.

53:10.555 --> 53:14.559
Now we can pay the hotel
and get your clothes back.

53:14.559 --> 53:17.428
You sure know how
to take the glow
off winning.

53:17.428 --> 53:21.932
I ordered you
to throw that match.

53:21.932 --> 53:23.768
You've cost me money.

53:23.768 --> 53:24.969
Big money!

53:24.969 --> 53:26.437
Bigger than your hair?

53:26.437 --> 53:28.038
We don't throw
matches.

53:28.038 --> 53:29.073
That's right.

53:29.073 --> 53:30.841
If you was soaked
in gasoline,

53:30.841 --> 53:33.511
we might throw matches--
the flaming kind.

53:33.511 --> 53:35.580
With that furball
on your head,

53:35.580 --> 53:37.782
you'd make
one hell of a torch.

53:37.782 --> 53:39.784
First you defy me,

53:39.784 --> 53:42.787
then you mock my hair?

53:42.787 --> 53:44.789
You're dead!

53:46.324 --> 53:48.025
Look out!

53:48.025 --> 53:50.361
Aah!

53:53.063 --> 53:54.265
Get him!

53:56.934 --> 53:58.869
Get out of my way!

53:58.869 --> 53:59.937
Ohh! stop!

53:59.937 --> 54:00.938
He's mine!

54:15.019 --> 54:17.988
I'll cut you
down to size!

54:21.091 --> 54:25.630
Whaaa!

54:25.630 --> 54:28.032
[Sean]
must have hit him
pretty hard.

54:28.032 --> 54:31.235
He landed headfirst in
the hotel swimming pool
next door.

54:31.235 --> 54:32.970
Must have made
a killer splash.

54:32.970 --> 54:34.305
No. the pool was empty.

54:34.305 --> 54:37.642
It would've killed him,
but his hair cushioned
the fall.

54:37.642 --> 54:42.112
At least he got
a metal plate
in the slammer.

54:42.112 --> 54:45.115
Wow. you really did
save his life.

54:45.115 --> 54:47.452
What can you
do now, pappy?

54:47.452 --> 54:50.254
What can I do now?

54:50.254 --> 54:51.489
Ha!

54:56.794 --> 54:58.228
Hyah!

54:58.228 --> 54:59.864
O.k. he'll do.

55:02.667 --> 55:04.669
I'll take you
to class.

55:04.669 --> 55:08.072
No way. I want to see
Alex get whupped.

55:08.072 --> 55:12.276
Alex, did Sean share
his invincible psych-out
technique with you?

55:12.276 --> 55:13.478
Yeah.

55:13.478 --> 55:15.079
Forget it.
Us little guys
need backup.

55:15.079 --> 55:17.948
Primitive, but effective.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.142
Hold on.

01:07:58.142 --> 01:07:59.743
It's for you.

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:01.111
Alex.

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:03.413
Go ahead. It's me.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:06.950
Lieutenant! want
a nice, fresh doughnut?

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:08.352
The toilet seat?

01:08:08.352 --> 01:08:11.955
We hid the chip inside,
on my workbench,

01:08:11.955 --> 01:08:13.557
next to my wallet.

01:08:13.557 --> 01:08:17.026
Bring it
to the 3rd street dock.

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:19.062
You have to come alone.

01:08:19.062 --> 01:08:20.997
It's thanatos!

01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:21.997
Alex!

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:23.966
Very stupid!

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:28.638
You take a swan dive
into an empty pool,
and I'm stupid?

01:08:28.638 --> 01:08:30.038
I'm so proud of you.

01:08:30.038 --> 01:08:31.441
Oh, how touching.

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:34.042
Like the family
i never had

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:37.447
and...never wanted!

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:39.048
Wolfgang,
tie them up.

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:40.649
Wait!
no!

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:43.386
No!
no!no!

01:08:43.386 --> 01:08:44.988
I'm going after them.

01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:47.657
How? you're just
a wrestler.

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:48.858
What? who told you?

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:51.595
I saw you wrestle
trick McGraw last year.

01:08:51.595 --> 01:08:54.063
Why didn't you
say something?

01:08:54.063 --> 01:08:56.466
Because I was desperate
for those kids.

01:08:56.466 --> 01:08:59.269
And I had a gut feeling
about you.

01:08:59.269 --> 01:09:02.272
I got to go.
I've got no choice.

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:04.674
You bring
that family back safe,

01:09:04.674 --> 01:09:07.676
or you will have
to answer to me.

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:13.317
You might as well bring
that scroungy, bullheaded
old gasbag back, too.

01:09:13.317 --> 01:09:15.519
I'll go get them.

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:16.420
Cover me.

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.688
I'm going out
Alex's window.

01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:21.090
Lieutenant!

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:23.091
Let me tell you
what happened.

01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:25.429
Now, they broke
in here...

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.702
[Motorcycle approaches]

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:46.850
What's he doing?
What's going on?

01:09:52.856 --> 01:09:55.259
I ought to
blow you away.

01:09:55.259 --> 01:09:58.262
Sorry. got to get
those brakes checked.

01:09:58.262 --> 01:09:59.363
Get up.

01:09:59.363 --> 01:10:01.765
Easy. all I'm carrying
is a wallet.

01:10:12.742 --> 01:10:15.845
[Wolfgang]
base to scarab-1.
What is your location?

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:17.747
[Engine starts]

01:10:21.518 --> 01:10:23.720
Why do you not answer?

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.954
Aah!

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:27.557
O.k.,
captain scumbucket.
Where am I going?

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:29.158
Blow it out your--aah!

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:30.294
North!

01:10:30.294 --> 01:10:33.363
Knew you'd see it
my way.

01:10:57.253 --> 01:11:00.790
As soon as we have
the chip,

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:03.059
kill them all.

01:11:03.059 --> 01:11:04.994
You lied.

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:07.931
So sue me.

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:12.068
Which way?

01:11:12.068 --> 01:11:13.269
That way.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.339
How many
number 53 markers
are there

01:11:15.339 --> 01:11:16.806
in biscayne bay?

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:17.641
One, obviously.

01:11:17.641 --> 01:11:20.544
Then why did we
pass it twice?

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.315
Uhh.

01:11:36.159 --> 01:11:37.794
I'll kill you for that.

01:11:56.513 --> 01:11:59.115
May I borrow
your keys?

01:11:59.115 --> 01:12:00.316
Huh?

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:01.918
Waah!

01:12:01.918 --> 01:12:04.053
Adios.

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:17.901
Hey!

01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:19.503
Bingo.

01:12:22.305 --> 01:12:23.740
They're coming in.

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:28.878
The anticipation
is almost too much to bear.

01:12:28.878 --> 01:12:30.480
So is your breath.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:34.618
Now we know
who's the first to die.

01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:45.462
They should be here
by now.

01:12:47.163 --> 01:12:48.164
Hey! what?

01:12:48.164 --> 01:12:49.499
Aah!

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:56.272
Base to scarab-1.

01:12:56.272 --> 01:12:58.041
What is taking so long?

01:12:58.041 --> 01:12:59.142
[Static]

01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:01.778
Why do you
not answer?

01:13:01.778 --> 01:13:02.812
Come in.

01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:05.915
[Thanatos]
i won't tolerate
ineptitude.

01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:08.017
Keep trying.

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:10.086
Come in.

01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:11.721
Come in.

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:13.857
Ach, there must be
something wrong.

01:13:13.857 --> 01:13:14.858
Freeze!

01:13:15.925 --> 01:13:16.860
My, my,

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:20.229
I expected a more
dramatic entrance

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:21.631
from a man
who wrestled

01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:24.300
at the west Memphis
pork pavilion.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.235
Hey, we won
in west Memphis.

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:28.772
But not tonight.

01:13:28.772 --> 01:13:30.474
Hyah!

01:13:35.445 --> 01:13:37.046
Hyah!

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:48.992
Aah!

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:52.696
Aah!

01:13:56.232 --> 01:13:57.333
Hyah!

01:13:57.333 --> 01:13:59.135
Hurry! untie us!

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:03.072
Just shoot
them both.

01:14:05.742 --> 01:14:08.912
Grrr!

01:14:08.912 --> 01:14:10.246
Grrr!

01:14:10.246 --> 01:14:12.882
Aah!

01:14:19.989 --> 01:14:22.025
Grraaahh!

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:27.531
Unlike you, Armstrong,

01:14:27.531 --> 01:14:29.799
I never lose.

01:14:31.868 --> 01:14:33.002
Ha ha ha ha!

01:14:34.437 --> 01:14:38.908
Now your friends
can watch you die.

01:14:38.908 --> 01:14:39.709
Ugh!

01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:41.711
Ah ha ha ha ha!

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:44.948
No!

01:14:45.749 --> 01:14:46.916
[Kate]
save him!

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:49.018
Get him, dad!
Help him!

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:50.019
Dad!

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:50.820
Aah!

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.622
I hate you!
I hate you!

01:14:52.622 --> 01:14:54.624
Let him--
let him go!

01:14:54.624 --> 01:14:55.892
Let him go!

01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:00.063
Aah!

01:15:04.968 --> 01:15:06.970
You shouldn't
have done that.

01:15:06.970 --> 01:15:08.471
Why not?

01:15:08.471 --> 01:15:11.675
'Cause you shouldn't
have hit a kid.

01:15:29.826 --> 01:15:30.794
Uhh!

01:15:30.794 --> 01:15:32.796
Alex, the button.

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:43.807
Swine!

01:15:43.807 --> 01:15:44.741
Aah!

01:15:44.741 --> 01:15:47.476
[Speaking German]

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:49.278
Hang out, Wolfie, baby.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.752
One move, and I will
destroy the chip.

01:15:55.752 --> 01:15:58.221
There's no chip in there,
dorkbrain.

01:16:01.090 --> 01:16:02.692
You lied.

01:16:02.692 --> 01:16:05.394
So sue me!

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:06.495
Grrr!

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:08.064
Alex, duck!

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:14.237
You screwed up
my hair.

01:16:14.237 --> 01:16:17.140
Now it's payback time.

01:16:31.655 --> 01:16:35.892
I will not be denied
my pleasure.

01:16:35.892 --> 01:16:37.460
He's going
to kill him.

01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:38.461
Do something, daddy.

01:16:38.461 --> 01:16:39.462
A transformer!

01:16:39.462 --> 01:16:42.265
We can generate
electricity.

01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:43.933
Intense!
a superconducting
magnetic beam!

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:45.601
Like we did to
miss Callahan?

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:46.602
What?

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.738
The nanny
with the braces.

01:16:56.545 --> 01:16:57.781
Hit it!

01:16:59.015 --> 01:17:00.750
Aah!

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:05.021
[Crowd cheers]

01:17:05.021 --> 01:17:07.290
Uhh!

01:17:09.058 --> 01:17:12.295
Now you die.

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:18.367
Ha ha ha ha ha!

01:17:18.367 --> 01:17:19.703
No more.

01:17:19.703 --> 01:17:21.504
It's not working,
dad!

01:17:21.504 --> 01:17:23.740
We need a conductor!

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:26.776
Come on, son,
hurry!

01:17:26.776 --> 01:17:28.244
Quick! quick!
Quick!

01:17:28.244 --> 01:17:29.846
Grab that end!

01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:38.254
Need a hand?

01:17:43.226 --> 01:17:45.328
O.k., lift it up.

01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:49.065
Grrr!

01:17:49.065 --> 01:17:50.366
Grrr!

01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:52.335
Hit the deck!

01:17:52.335 --> 01:17:56.339
Aah!

01:17:56.339 --> 01:17:57.741
Whoa!

01:17:57.741 --> 01:17:58.742
Whoa!

01:17:58.742 --> 01:17:59.776
Whoa!

01:17:59.776 --> 01:18:01.778
Whoa! whoa!

01:18:01.778 --> 01:18:03.379
Stop this thing!

01:18:03.379 --> 01:18:04.380
Whoa!

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:06.783
This beats
the 4th of July.

01:18:06.783 --> 01:18:08.251
He's toast.

01:18:08.251 --> 01:18:09.753
Aah!

01:18:09.753 --> 01:18:11.721
Aah! aah! Aah!

01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:16.726
Aah! aah! Aah!

01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:20.129
[Kate]
wow!

01:18:25.101 --> 01:18:28.104
Man really
blew his top.

01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:30.807
So where's
the stupid chip?

01:18:30.807 --> 01:18:32.408
Kate has it.

01:18:32.408 --> 01:18:33.409
Do not.

01:18:33.409 --> 01:18:34.811
Yes, you do, honey,

01:18:34.811 --> 01:18:36.913
right here
in your Dolly.

01:18:42.185 --> 01:18:43.619
Sure about this?

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:45.889
I don't need her
anymore.

01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:50.827
You're a brave man.

01:18:50.827 --> 01:18:52.228
You're the brave one.

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:56.332
Raising kids is
the toughest gig I know.

01:19:02.806 --> 01:19:05.074
Ahem.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:07.410
Hey, Burt, thanks
for getting me

01:19:07.410 --> 01:19:08.444
out of the ring.

01:19:08.444 --> 01:19:11.314
I'm going to
need a partner
around here.

01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:15.418
Thanks, but
i haven't had
a vacation since...

01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:17.120
Since I met you.

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:18.521
Vacation?
if you need me,

01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:22.225
I can get out of
this monkey suit
real quick.

01:19:22.225 --> 01:19:25.428
How far can you get
on two broken legs?

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:26.830
Quit mothering me.

01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:28.431
I love you guys.

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:30.033
We love you, too.

01:19:40.844 --> 01:19:42.111
See you soon.

01:19:42.111 --> 01:19:44.313
Maybe sooner
than you think.

01:19:44.313 --> 01:19:45.849
Bye, Sean.

01:19:52.588 --> 01:19:54.590

going to--

make him stay.

is over *

* I'm gonna
settle down *

* I'll find a little shack *

* by the railroad track *

01:20:15.678 --> 01:20:17.881
* on the outskirts
of town *

01:20:17.881 --> 01:20:20.149
* I'll plant
a little garden *

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:22.385
* and watch
the flowers grow *
