<i>-What?</i>
<i>-It's not touching the 21st floor at all.</i>

<i>That's breathtaking. This is more,</i>

20:45.202 --> 20:49.414
<i>[Juawana] It feels like you're one with</i>

20:49.498 --> 20:50.958
<i>[Colony] One with the water?</i>

20:51.041 --> 20:53.085

21:22.030 --> 21:23.573
<i>Why you say that?</i>

21:23.657 --> 21:27.619
<i>Because, you know, a lot of us are just</i>

<i>I feel like</i>

<i>and, you know, it's just,</i>
<i>I don't know. I feel a way.</i>

21:42.467 --> 21:43.927
<i>I'm a direct person.</i>

21:44.011 --> 21:45.887
