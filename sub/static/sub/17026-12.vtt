02:46.399 --> 02:48.519
Now I'm in my 40s,

02:48.519 --> 02:51.879
I've finally discovered the answer
for visibly firmer looking skin

02:55.439 --> 02:57.599
Boosts surface skin cell renewal

02:57.599 --> 02:59.879
leaving you with noticeably
firmer looking skin.

03:03.639 --> 03:05.199
Because beauty is a statement

04:20.197 --> 04:21.798
Rasgotra:
The toughest thing
about being a doctor

04:21.918 --> 04:23.638
isn't the terrible hours.

04:23.798 --> 04:26.078
It isn't the loneliness,
the isolation,

04:26.238 --> 04:28.798
or the knowledge that,
one day, we all lose out

04:28.958 --> 04:31.238
to the relentless decay
of the human body.

04:31.398 --> 04:34.358
No.
It's something else.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.278
(Phone ringing)

04:51.838 --> 04:54.358
Ray, it's 5:00am.

04:54.358 --> 04:56.078
Bbeeping)

04:56.078 --> 04:57.957
Yes, I know.

04:58.117 --> 05:02.277
But sometimes we do actually
get to sleep on call.

05:02.277 --> 05:03.757
Good. You should be.

05:03.877 --> 05:07.357
You know I have those stupid
interviews later today.

05:07.477 --> 05:09.557
No, I didn't forget.

05:09.717 --> 05:11.957
Happy birthday.

05:12.077 --> 05:13.557
Of course I was going to call.

05:13.717 --> 05:16.037
It's 5:00am, man,
give me a chance.

05:16.037 --> 05:18.197
(beeping)

05:18.317 --> 05:19.717
It's my intern.
I better answer.

05:19.837 --> 05:21.797
I'll call you later, OK? Bye.

05:26.797 --> 05:27.717
Hey, Ana.

05:27.877 --> 05:29.317
You having a party
in here?

05:29.437 --> 05:30.437
Something like that.

05:30.597 --> 05:32.517
Tachy all night and then
the BP took a dive.

05:32.517 --> 05:35.397
Crackles bilaterally.

05:35.517 --> 05:37.717
I left mine in the ER.

05:37.877 --> 05:39.517
Sensitivities come back
on the blood culture?

05:39.717 --> 05:41.117
Vanco-resistant
enterococcus.

05:41.117 --> 05:42.997
That's what you were
worried about, right?

05:43.157 --> 05:45.557
Yeah. Let the picu know
we're coming.

05:49.037 --> 05:50.477
Pick a colour and a number
between one and ten.

05:50.477 --> 05:53.357
Blue and three.

05:53.357 --> 05:55.757
B-L-U-E.

05:55.917 --> 05:57.357
One, two, three.
Hey, at this point,

05:57.517 --> 05:59.197
removing the source
of infection

05:59.317 --> 06:00.397
is our best option.

06:00.597 --> 06:02.597
You mean taking out
my gall bladder?
Yeah.

06:02.757 --> 06:04.757
Let's finally
get you better, OK?

06:04.757 --> 06:07.637
Hurry up.
I'm getting sick of you people.

06:07.797 --> 06:10.317
I'm going to go
call your mom.

06:11.557 --> 06:12.517
Hang in there, Ana.

06:12.677 --> 06:14.237
I'll check on you
in a little while.

06:14.237 --> 06:15.757
Don't you want
to hear your fortune?

06:15.877 --> 06:17.997
I'll be back soon, I promise.

06:19.357 --> 06:22.077
Lucien, are you
sure about this?

06:22.237 --> 06:23.437
No, but the conservative
approach

06:23.557 --> 06:24.717
doesn't seem to be working out.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.757
She's bacteremic
and hypotensive.
If we go in now...

06:26.917 --> 06:29.397
'The toughest thing is making
the right call when it counts.'

06:29.517 --> 06:30.557
Forget it.

06:30.677 --> 06:31.717
What, you have another idea?

06:31.837 --> 06:33.077
No, it's fine.
Neela, you're going to be

06:33.237 --> 06:35.076
an attending soon, you better
get used to asserting yourself.

06:35.236 --> 06:36.996
No, really, you're probably
right. I'll go let the OR...

06:36.996 --> 06:38.116
You know what?
These sorts of decisions

06:38.276 --> 06:39.556
are the hardest
part of our job.

06:39.676 --> 06:40.836
You consider the alternatives,

06:40.996 --> 06:43.156
follow through in your mind
and make a choice.

06:43.276 --> 06:45.636
Can't control what
happens after that.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.636
OR in ten minutes.
I'll meet you there.

06:55.116 --> 06:56.796
Yeah, that's totally
going to make the elevator

06:56.916 --> 06:58.276
come faster.

07:12.876 --> 07:14.316
Sorry, uh...

07:15.316 --> 07:16.596
Found it.

07:20.436 --> 07:22.436
Dr Rasgotra,
perfect timing.

07:22.636 --> 07:24.796
Page the intern,
I'm not really here.
Nick Vasquez, 28,

07:24.956 --> 07:26.316
fell through a second
storey window.

07:26.316 --> 07:27.796
A closed window, unfortunately.

07:27.916 --> 07:29.156
How'd you fall?

07:29.276 --> 07:30.356
I was bailing out of a plane.

07:31.916 --> 07:33.916
In my dream.
I'm a dream runner.

07:33.916 --> 07:36.076
"Dream runner"?
Most people are
paralyzed during REM sleep,

07:36.076 --> 07:38.196
so they don't actually do what
they're dreaming about doing.

07:38.356 --> 07:40.916
My brain chemistry's off,
so that

07:41.116 --> 07:42.676
paralysis thing
doesn't work right.

07:42.796 --> 07:43.996
So you act things out?

07:44.196 --> 07:46.796
Big wave surfing, car chases,
dragon slaying...

07:46.916 --> 07:48.116
I've done it all.

07:48.276 --> 07:49.676
On my count -
one, two, three.

07:50.916 --> 07:52.916
Gates: All right,
vitals stable en route,

07:53.076 --> 07:54.276
complaining
about abdominal pain.

07:54.436 --> 07:55.876
Well, that's
understandable.

07:55.996 --> 07:57.356
Tib-fib displaced.

07:57.556 --> 07:59.316
I'm going to go get
a stryker probe.
What? Why?

07:59.516 --> 08:00.876
Morris: Gates missed
a bad compartment syndrome

08:01.036 --> 08:02.436
last week. Doesn't want
to get burned again.

08:02.596 --> 08:04.156
Well, it's a good pedal pulse,
no swelling.

08:04.316 --> 08:05.236
I doubt it's
compartment syndrome.

08:05.356 --> 08:06.556
I'll be right back.

08:11.196 --> 08:12.596
Hey.

08:12.716 --> 08:14.675
Hey.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.675
Here.

08:16.795 --> 08:17.915
What's this?

08:18.035 --> 08:19.755
Those Blackhawk
tickets that we got.

08:19.755 --> 08:21.155
It's, uh, this week.

08:21.315 --> 08:22.795
You take them, Sam.
Take Alex.

08:22.955 --> 08:24.595
No, no-no-no,
it was your idea.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.035
You might want
to take someone else.

08:26.115 --> 08:27.315
Banfield: Gates!

08:27.475 --> 08:28.875
You have six patients
on the board,

08:29.035 --> 08:30.795
including a fresh trauma,
so cut the chatter.

08:30.915 --> 08:32.755
Dr Morris...

08:32.875 --> 08:34.235
Banfield: Four of your
patients bounced back tonight.

08:34.395 --> 08:36.674
It'd be OK if you did.
If I did what?

08:36.794 --> 08:37.914
Take someone else.

08:38.034 --> 08:38.995
Sam, will you stop it?

08:39.155 --> 08:40.635
There's no-one else
I want to take.

08:40.755 --> 08:42.875
Here.

08:43.034 --> 08:44.275
Gates, get plain films,

08:44.435 --> 08:45.715
then remove shards
and then irrigate.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.075
Sam, we could use
you in there, too.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.875
Poor guy's
IV keeps blowing.
No problem.

08:48.875 --> 08:50.715
Check crit Q 30...
What the hell was that?

08:50.875 --> 08:52.635
What was what?
Banfield, man.

08:52.795 --> 08:54.235
One minute she's kind
of loose and cool,

08:54.395 --> 08:56.355
and then snap, she's
back to piranha queen.

08:56.355 --> 08:58.395
I think she was
actually annoyed at
me for being short.

08:58.555 --> 09:01.355
She made Frank take off his tie
and throw it in the trash.

09:01.475 --> 09:04.435
Dr Morris, come with me,
it's important.

09:04.595 --> 09:06.115
Uh, good luck with
the interview thing.

09:06.235 --> 09:07.675
Oh, right.

09:09.435 --> 09:11.395
OK, you ready?

09:11.515 --> 09:13.155
Uh-huh.

09:13.275 --> 09:14.595
Ta-da!

09:14.715 --> 09:16.075
I got under the mud flaps

09:16.235 --> 09:17.395
and matched
the original colour.

09:17.555 --> 09:19.675
You are kidding!
Mm-hmm.

09:19.835 --> 09:21.995
I rebuilt the engine,
threw away the amels

09:22.155 --> 09:24.195
and installed
Mikuni carburettors.

09:25.635 --> 09:27.555
My, my dad...

09:27.715 --> 09:30.715
showed up on this for
his first date with my mom.

09:30.875 --> 09:31.955
Yeah.
She was mortified.

09:32.115 --> 09:33.395
Made them walk
to the movies.

09:33.555 --> 09:34.355
(chuckles)
A month later,

09:34.515 --> 09:36.635
she was riding
on the back of this thing

09:36.635 --> 09:37.755
wearing nothing
but a macrame bikini.

09:37.875 --> 09:40.955
Yeah, these have that
effect on people.

09:41.075 --> 09:43.115
OK. Go ahead.

09:43.235 --> 09:44.955
Try out your new bike.

09:45.075 --> 09:46.155
No... My new?

09:46.315 --> 09:47.875
No, Jerry, I said you
could have it.

09:47.875 --> 09:50.755
No way.
This belongs with you.

09:50.875 --> 09:52.674
Fire it up.

09:54.674 --> 09:57.274
(engine revs)

09:57.394 --> 09:59.954
Keep the shiny side up!

10:10.394 --> 10:11.754
(crashes, thuds)

10:15.074 --> 10:16.994
Dubenko:
Take a few breaths
and when you wake up,

10:16.994 --> 10:18.834
we'll be done.
Anastasia:
Dr Rasgotra, you're

10:18.834 --> 10:19.834
gonna be here
the whole time, right?

10:19.834 --> 10:21.274
Whole time.

10:21.394 --> 10:22.554
Did you remember the music?

10:22.554 --> 10:24.274
Sure did.

10:27.434 --> 10:29.954
(classical cello
melody playing)

10:31.954 --> 10:33.834
That's nice.

10:36.914 --> 10:40.154
Suite for solo cello
number 1 in G.

10:40.234 --> 10:42.794
Dr Rasgotra, you rock.

10:47.354 --> 10:49.114
Dubenko:
OK. Let's get started.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.554
Neela needs
to get out of here

10:50.754 --> 10:52.074
to get to work
on her future.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.034
It's OK.
I cancelled my appointments.

10:54.194 --> 10:55.674
What? Why?
First litre's up.

10:55.834 --> 10:57.594
I'm post-call
and exhausted.

10:57.714 --> 11:00.114
I called in some favours to get
you those interviews, you know.

11:00.274 --> 11:02.354
I understand you feel bad
about me not having a job here.

11:02.554 --> 11:04.274
Who told you that?
All this time
you've been acting

11:04.394 --> 11:06.474
like you'd never let me leave,
but I get it.

11:06.634 --> 11:07.434
Things change.

11:07.554 --> 11:08.714
Where is all this coming from?

11:08.834 --> 11:10.114
You and I have never

11:10.274 --> 11:12.594
had a serious conversation about
the prospect of you staying.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.314
Exactly. 11 blade.

11:14.434 --> 11:15.634
Trocar.

11:20.394 --> 11:21.754
Ooh, it's hot in here.

11:21.874 --> 11:22.794
Is it hot in here?

11:22.914 --> 11:24.794
Check this out.

11:24.954 --> 11:26.034
It's fine.

11:26.234 --> 11:28.154
Except for the pelvic
fracture, right?

11:28.274 --> 11:30.193
(groans)

11:30.353 --> 11:32.673
Uh, grade two,
non-displaced.

11:33.833 --> 11:35.193
Somebody's here
to see you.

11:35.353 --> 11:37.273
(chuckles)
Hey, honey.

11:39.553 --> 11:41.033
Find someone to take
Oliver for the night?

11:41.153 --> 11:42.353
Yeah, your mom
came over.

11:42.513 --> 11:44.873
Thank God you're OK.
Give us some room.

11:45.033 --> 11:46.393
You know, we've tried
everything:

11:46.553 --> 11:48.553
sleeping bags, mitts,
even handcuffing him to the bed.

11:48.713 --> 11:50.313
Hey, now.
(chuckles)

11:50.473 --> 11:52.713
But every few months,
he has a crazy dream

11:52.873 --> 11:54.033
and ends up back
in the hospital.

11:54.153 --> 11:55.153
Oliver's your son?

11:55.273 --> 11:56.873
Yeah. Just turned one.

11:57.033 --> 11:58.713
Crit dropped
another two points.

11:58.713 --> 12:00.193
It's dilutional,
most likely.

12:00.393 --> 12:02.193
All right, we'll
check another hemacue
in a half hour.

12:02.273 --> 12:03.353
What, and meanwhile, we just

12:03.353 --> 12:04.393
let it keep dropping?

12:04.553 --> 12:05.793
I thought you said
it was "dilutional"?

12:05.913 --> 12:07.273
Recheck it now, Sam.

12:07.433 --> 12:08.993
I already signed out
to Suri.

12:08.993 --> 12:11.193
I'll let her know.
What? You're leaving?

12:11.353 --> 12:12.713
Yeah, my shift is over.
And they're waiting for me.

12:12.713 --> 12:15.513
Shifts and breaks -
such a nurse-y concept.

12:15.633 --> 12:17.193
Always hated them.

12:17.313 --> 12:19.073
Bye, Mr Vasquez.

12:24.153 --> 12:26.673
Damn it, I think I nicked
the common bile duct.

12:26.673 --> 12:28.193
You think you did
or you did?

12:28.313 --> 12:29.753
You did.

12:29.953 --> 12:31.713
There's so much inflamed tissue,
I couldn't see.
Well, then you had

12:31.873 --> 12:33.273
no business in cutting -
ten blade to me.

12:33.273 --> 12:35.113
We're converting to open.
Shirley:
Systolic's 86.

12:35.113 --> 12:36.393
Perry:
Everyone knows
Samantha Taggart

12:36.513 --> 12:38.193
from the ER, right?

12:38.353 --> 12:39.953
I'm starting clinicals for my
nurse anesthetist program.
Sponge.

12:44.353 --> 12:45.393
Perry:
Record the vitals

12:45.553 --> 12:47.233
Q five minutes.
I'm going to check next door.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.033
You're leaving?
I'm precepting another trainee.

12:49.153 --> 12:50.353
I'll be in and out.

12:50.353 --> 12:51.633
Bovie.
Something the matter?

12:51.833 --> 12:53.073
It's probably not
the best teaching case.
Neela!

12:53.233 --> 12:54.193
Counter traction.
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

12:54.313 --> 12:55.153
Don't take it personally.

12:55.273 --> 12:56.273
It's a teaching hospital, Neela.

12:56.393 --> 12:57.273
Yes, I'm aware of that.

12:57.433 --> 12:58.873
Guys...
But operating on her

12:59.033 --> 13:00.153
was dicey to begin with...
That's your call...

13:00.273 --> 13:01.513
So at the very least,
we should have our A team

13:01.713 --> 13:03.193
on the case.
I will throw
both of you out of here,

13:03.393 --> 13:04.953
I swear to God I will.
Focus on your job,
let me do mine.

13:05.113 --> 13:07.032
Oh, my God!
(screams)

14:06.072 --> 14:08.032
..so beautiful.

14:08.912 --> 14:10.312
We're calling her Laura.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.352
We think she looks like a Laura.

14:13.192 --> 14:15.152
She already has a full head of hair.

14:16.672 --> 14:18.632
And she's got my eyes.

14:19.512 --> 14:21.072
Luckily
for her,

14:21.152 --> 14:22.952
everything else is pure Sarah.

14:23.072 --> 14:25.352
With free
Skype-to-Skype video calls,

14:25.432 --> 14:27.792
you can be right there with them,

14:27.872 --> 14:28.832
wherever they are.

15:00.311 --> 15:02.351
Sensations presents

15:02.431 --> 15:04.431
a journey through flavour.

15:06.751 --> 15:09.071
Let chilli and basil entice.

15:09.151 --> 15:11.191
(echoes) Entice, entice...

15:11.671 --> 15:15.871
GENTLE BIRDSONG
Let sweetness delight.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.711
DRAMATIC DRUMMING

15:20.911 --> 15:23.111
And let heat thrill.

15:24.951 --> 15:27.471
Sensations Thai Sweet Chilli.

16:40.390 --> 16:42.510
Now I'm in my 40s,

16:42.510 --> 16:45.870
I've finally discovered the answer
for visibly firmer looking skin

16:49.430 --> 16:51.590
Boosts surface skin cell renewal

16:51.590 --> 16:53.870
leaving you with noticeably
firmer looking skin.

16:57.630 --> 16:59.190
Because beauty is a statement

18:21.389 --> 18:22.629
I dialed
the halothane down

18:22.789 --> 18:24.309
when her pressures
started getting dicey.

18:24.469 --> 18:25.589
I'm in.
I forgot to tell you

18:25.749 --> 18:27.229
to turn it back up
after a few minutes.

18:27.389 --> 18:28.749
You forgot?
I am so sorry.

18:28.909 --> 18:29.989
Yeah, well, tell it to the girl
on the table.

18:29.989 --> 18:32.229
OK, let's clean this mess up
and move on.

18:32.429 --> 18:34.749
Run of six, giving lido
40 milligrams blous.
40 migs.

18:34.909 --> 18:37.509
Right.
Then .5 per minute.

18:37.629 --> 18:39.509
It's the ER.
They need a surgeon down there.

18:41.789 --> 18:43.709
Surgery's got
an unstable kid on the table.

18:43.869 --> 18:46.189
It's going to be a while.
Great(!)

18:46.189 --> 18:47.949
Cordis in.
That wasn't so bad.

18:48.109 --> 18:49.709
He's got a high tolerance
for pain.

18:49.909 --> 18:51.029
Hang a unit
of type specific.

18:51.109 --> 18:52.309
How's it going in here?

18:52.509 --> 18:55.349
He's tachy and crit's down
to 29.
All right,

18:55.549 --> 18:57.429
let's pack him up
and get him to angio.
Angio?

18:57.549 --> 18:58.549
You mean CT, right?

18:58.669 --> 18:59.949
No, I mean angio.

19:00.149 --> 19:01.869
Banfield:
He has a pelvic fracture.
Gates: The fracture's

19:02.029 --> 19:03.109
non-displaced,
unlikely to bleed.

19:03.229 --> 19:04.309
The ultrasound was negative.

19:04.469 --> 19:05.869
Could be
retroperitoneal.

19:06.029 --> 19:07.229
Banfield:
If the angiogram is normal,

19:07.349 --> 19:08.389
we'll explore that theory.

19:08.509 --> 19:10.709
Right now, the pelvis is
where the money is.

19:10.869 --> 19:13.909
You know...
in all these dreams,

19:14.029 --> 19:16.309
you're always there.

19:16.429 --> 19:19.349
You're always the girl.

19:19.469 --> 19:21.109
Nick?

19:21.229 --> 19:22.269
Mac three and an 8-0.

19:22.389 --> 19:23.269
Oh, my God,
what's happening?

19:23.349 --> 19:24.669
5,000 units of heparin.

19:24.829 --> 19:25.869
Do you want to give
protein C first?

19:26.029 --> 19:27.109
It's not standard protocol,
but there've been some

19:27.269 --> 19:28.109
good outcomes for DIC
with sepsis.

19:28.309 --> 19:30.669
Go ahead.
The thing is, you
have to give it

19:30.829 --> 19:32.429
before you give the heparin
or it won't work.

19:32.589 --> 19:33.909
It's something that
came up in a class.

19:34.069 --> 19:35.789
OK, protein C,
and then heparin.

19:37.349 --> 19:38.388
V tach!

19:39.428 --> 19:40.748
I can't believe this.

19:40.948 --> 19:42.348
Point four of epi.
Taggart:
Going in.

19:45.148 --> 19:46.068
Clear!

19:47.468 --> 19:48.548
No change.

19:48.668 --> 19:50.028
Again. Clear!

19:51.188 --> 19:53.108
No change.
Again. Clear!

19:55.548 --> 19:57.308
Hey.
What happened?

19:57.468 --> 19:58.668
What did
the angio show?

19:58.828 --> 20:00.428
Lost his pulse before
we could do the study.

20:00.548 --> 20:02.348
Charged to 360.

20:02.468 --> 20:03.468
Clear!

20:04.668 --> 20:05.468
No change.

20:05.588 --> 20:07.388
Give the amiodarone.

20:07.508 --> 20:08.388
I'm sorry to belabour this,

20:08.548 --> 20:09.428
but you don't
drop your crit

20:09.588 --> 20:10.548
ten points
from a non-displaced pelvis.

20:10.668 --> 20:11.548
It could happen.

20:11.708 --> 20:12.748
If you'd scanned him,
you might've seen

20:12.908 --> 20:14.668
what I'm seeing in time
to do something about it.

20:14.788 --> 20:15.628
Go find an OR.

20:15.788 --> 20:16.988
The belly is full of blood.

20:17.188 --> 20:18.788
You know where it's
coming from? Go!
Clear!

20:18.948 --> 20:20.988
Taggart:
Fourth epi's in.

20:21.108 --> 20:22.868
OK, someone needs
to update the mother.

20:23.028 --> 20:24.148
I should have
fought you on this.

20:24.268 --> 20:25.308
Yes, maybe you should have.

20:25.468 --> 20:27.348
Dream runner's bleeding
out in angio.

20:27.508 --> 20:29.228
OK, go, Neela.
I promised I'd stay.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.908
Hold compressions.

20:31.108 --> 20:32.708
V-fib.
Dubenko:
Switch out.

20:35.788 --> 20:36.868
Go, Neela.

20:36.988 --> 20:39.228
Go.

20:43.468 --> 20:44.828
Go!

20:51.748 --> 20:54.508
(phone ringing)

20:54.508 --> 20:56.308
Ray, I'll call later.

21:03.708 --> 21:05.508
Banfield:
Hold compressions.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.948
Morris:
Still asystole.

21:12.268 --> 21:14.148
This is over.

21:16.947 --> 21:19.187
13:43.

21:30.947 --> 21:33.747
Please know that we did
everything we could.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.307
Excuse me.

21:46.187 --> 21:48.667
This can't really
be happening.

21:49.667 --> 21:52.627
I'm so sorry.

21:55.907 --> 21:58.707
This feels like a dream.

21:58.867 --> 22:00.467
Banfield:
We can't see the future.

22:00.667 --> 22:02.547
Sometimes we can,
actually.

22:02.707 --> 22:04.107
With this handy new technology
called the CT.

22:04.227 --> 22:05.067
Have you heard of it?

22:05.187 --> 22:06.827
Fine!

22:06.987 --> 22:08.187
Do I wish I could
do it over?

22:08.307 --> 22:09.227
Yeah. I do.

22:09.347 --> 22:10.627
But there was no way
to know

22:10.627 --> 22:11.787
that that was
the wrong...

22:11.987 --> 22:13.827
Gates was begging you
to get the scan.
Gates is a resident.

22:13.987 --> 22:15.907
Don't make this
about hierarchy.

22:16.027 --> 22:17.627
If any of us, even you,

22:17.787 --> 22:18.827
refuse to hear
another opinion,

22:18.947 --> 22:20.387
the system breaks down.

22:20.387 --> 22:21.387
What system?

22:21.547 --> 22:22.827
You guys don't have
a system.

22:22.987 --> 22:24.747
All I see here is chaos
and disorder.

22:24.907 --> 22:25.947
Well, maybe that's
the problem.

22:26.107 --> 22:27.147
Maybe that's why,
after five months,

22:27.307 --> 22:28.427
you still don't
get it!

22:28.427 --> 22:30.267
You still don't fit in!
Fit in?

22:30.387 --> 22:31.947
This isn't junior high.

22:32.067 --> 22:33.107
We are a team.

22:33.107 --> 22:33.987
We work together.

22:34.107 --> 22:35.187
But you think

22:35.347 --> 22:36.867
that you're so much better
than all of us,

22:36.867 --> 22:37.907
so much, so much smarter,

22:38.067 --> 22:39.347
you will never let yourself
be part of it.

22:39.507 --> 22:40.987
That is not...
If you want
to be a queen,

22:41.147 --> 22:42.947
go into private practice,
go back to Indonesia,

22:43.067 --> 22:44.667
leave medicine
altogether.

22:44.827 --> 22:46.667
But don't torture
us here.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.587
Dr Banfield...

22:49.747 --> 22:53.707
Jerry, turn this in
to human resources, OK?

22:53.827 --> 22:54.866
What are you doing?

22:54.986 --> 22:57.226
Going home.

22:57.346 --> 22:58.466
This isn't your fault.

22:58.466 --> 22:59.506
If I had come
down sooner,

22:59.746 --> 23:01.106
I could have
prevented...
It's not about you.

23:01.266 --> 23:02.506
Dr Banfield, what's
really going on?

23:02.626 --> 23:03.506
Are you sick?

23:03.666 --> 23:05.066
I mean, this morning,
the injection...

23:05.226 --> 23:07.106
(voice breaking) Please.
Leave me alone.

23:08.866 --> 23:11.546
(phone rings)

23:11.666 --> 23:13.586
Hello?

23:15.146 --> 23:16.986
Yes, I'll sign
the death certificate.

23:23.546 --> 23:24.986
Wow.

23:25.146 --> 23:27.946
Now what did that phone do
to deserve that?

23:29.626 --> 23:31.546
Hi, Simon.
Great to see you.

23:31.666 --> 23:32.546
How was Australia?

23:32.666 --> 23:33.826
Good.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.786
You OK?

23:35.946 --> 23:39.586
It's just been
an unbelievably horrible day.

23:39.706 --> 23:41.546
You know what you need?

23:42.826 --> 23:44.706
A didgeridoo.

23:46.746 --> 23:49.346
Banfield just quit and I just
helped kill two patients.

23:49.466 --> 23:51.306
Ah...

23:51.426 --> 23:52.906
Neela, I'm sorry.

23:52.906 --> 23:54.866
Neela...

24:56.385 --> 24:58.385
Does yours sink
and exaggerate pores?

24:58.505 --> 25:00.305
Our liquid mousse
cushions as it blends.

25:00.385 --> 25:02.105
Skin looks poreless, smoother,

25:02.185 --> 25:03.065
satin perfect.

25:03.145 --> 25:04.425
Like it's been airbrushed.

25:04.505 --> 25:05.625

Introducing Embrace from Gillette

26:19.824 --> 26:21.624

surrounded by a ribbon of moisture

26:25.384 --> 26:27.184

26:49.104 --> 26:51.064
..so beautiful.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.344
We're calling her Laura.

26:53.424 --> 26:55.384
We think she looks like a Laura.

26:56.224 --> 26:58.184
She already has a full head of hair.

26:59.704 --> 27:01.664
And she's got my eyes.

27:02.544 --> 27:04.104
Luckily

27:04.184 --> 27:05.984
everything else is pure Sarah.

29:03.103 --> 29:05.463
Rasgotra:
The care of every patient
is a twisty maze

29:05.623 --> 29:08.063
that leads to an infinite
number of potential outcomes.

29:08.223 --> 29:10.623
We hope that knowledge
and experience guide us,

29:10.743 --> 29:12.583
but sometimes
it becomes obvious

29:12.663 --> 29:15.023
a wrong turn was made.

29:20.143 --> 29:24.103
(phone ringing)

29:26.943 --> 29:28.983
Ray, it's 5:00am.

29:28.983 --> 29:31.743
(beeping)

29:32.423 --> 29:35.582
I know, but sometimes we do

29:35.582 --> 29:37.582
actually get to sleep on call.

29:37.582 --> 29:40.662
Pick a colour and a number
between one and ten.

29:40.782 --> 29:43.462
Blue and three.

29:43.582 --> 29:46.382

29:46.542 --> 29:48.142
Hey, at this point,
One, two, three.

29:48.302 --> 29:49.502
removing the source
of infection

29:49.502 --> 29:50.982
is our best option.

29:51.142 --> 29:52.702
You mean taking out
my gall bladder.

29:52.862 --> 29:54.222
Let's finally get you
better OK?

29:54.422 --> 29:56.902
Hurry up, I'm getting sick
of you people.

29:57.022 --> 29:58.342
I'm going to go call your mom.

30:00.382 --> 30:02.942
Hang in there, Ana, I'll check
on you in a little while.

30:03.102 --> 30:03.982
Don't you want to hear
your fortune?

30:04.102 --> 30:05.502
I'll be back soon, I promise.

30:05.662 --> 30:06.942
Rasgotra:
If only it were possible

30:07.102 --> 30:08.462
to apply the wisdom
of our mistakes.

30:08.622 --> 30:12.302
Go back to the fork in the road
and this time, be assertive.

30:12.302 --> 30:14.102
Choose the road
we think we should take,

30:14.262 --> 30:15.862
not the path
of least resistance.

30:15.982 --> 30:16.902
Forget it.

30:17.902 --> 30:19.302
No, wait.

30:19.422 --> 30:20.302
Don't forget it.

30:20.462 --> 30:21.462
She could die
on the table.

30:21.622 --> 30:23.182
Yeah, well, she could die
if we do nothing.

30:23.302 --> 30:25.022
These sorts of decisions are
the hardest part of our job.

30:25.142 --> 30:26.182
Well, let's wait one more day.

30:26.262 --> 30:27.142
We'll move her to the picu,

30:27.342 --> 30:29.222
I'll get ID to approve
the synercid.

30:29.222 --> 30:30.182
If there's no improvement,
we'll take her

30:30.342 --> 30:31.422
to the OR
first thing tomorrow.

30:31.542 --> 30:32.862
OK.

30:33.022 --> 30:34.622
OK?
Yeah.

30:34.782 --> 30:36.702
You're almost an attending, I
need to start listening to you.

30:36.862 --> 30:38.502
Meet me in the unit
for rounds in ten.

30:45.702 --> 30:47.662
Yeah, that's totally
going to make

30:47.782 --> 30:49.182
the elevator come faster.

30:49.342 --> 30:50.982
What, are you like
in seventh grade?

30:51.102 --> 30:53.742
I look young, I know.

31:07.262 --> 31:08.462
You know,
of course I realize

31:08.622 --> 31:09.742
that pressing
a button ten times

31:09.862 --> 31:11.462
is not going to make it
come any faster,

31:11.622 --> 31:13.742
but sometimes, when you're
powerless in a situation,

31:13.902 --> 31:15.301
you've got
to do something.

31:15.461 --> 31:17.221
That's why you're
a surgeon, right?

31:17.341 --> 31:19.821
You like to cut, fix, do.

31:19.821 --> 31:21.461
I suppose.

31:21.541 --> 31:23.941
Ah, but to choose inaction

31:24.101 --> 31:27.221
is in and of itself action,
isn't it?

31:27.221 --> 31:29.221
Who are you?

31:29.221 --> 31:30.181
Ned Roth.

31:30.181 --> 31:31.661
Patient transport
specialist.

31:31.781 --> 31:32.661
Buddhist.

31:32.781 --> 31:33.941
Omnivore.

31:34.101 --> 31:35.901
Neela...
Rasgotra.

31:35.901 --> 31:37.741
Yes. I know.

31:37.901 --> 31:39.781
Have a nice day,
Doctor.

31:58.701 --> 32:00.301
What are you doing?

32:00.501 --> 32:03.501
And don't say it's
none of my business,
because it is.

32:03.621 --> 32:04.941
It is?

32:05.061 --> 32:06.381
How's that?

32:06.381 --> 32:07.781
Because if you're doing
drugs, we need to know.

32:07.941 --> 32:09.741
And if you really wanted
to keep it a secret,

32:09.901 --> 32:11.341
you wouldn't be shooting
up in the break room.

32:11.461 --> 32:12.541
It's 5:30 in the morning.

32:12.701 --> 32:14.501
I didn't think anyone
would be in here.

32:15.781 --> 32:17.941
It's recombinant FSH hormone.

32:18.021 --> 32:19.461
We're trying to have a baby.

32:19.461 --> 32:21.461
Oh.

32:21.581 --> 32:23.821
Wow.

32:23.941 --> 32:26.261
We're giving in vitro a try.

32:26.381 --> 32:28.461
Well, that's exciting.

32:28.621 --> 32:30.861
Well, we better all hope
it works the first time

32:30.981 --> 32:32.141
because, I'll tell you,

32:32.301 --> 32:34.221
these drugs and doctoring
is a dangerous mix.

32:34.341 --> 32:36.181
Why do you say that?

32:38.181 --> 32:40.381
I'm erratic, indecisive,

32:40.541 --> 32:42.341
and I've been a real
bitch to the staff.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.821
Really?

32:43.941 --> 32:45.741
Even more than I usually am.

32:45.901 --> 32:48.301
Everyone and everything just
seems to get on my nerves.

32:48.461 --> 32:50.701
I don't know,
maybe I should quit.

32:50.821 --> 32:52.620
Oh, no.

32:52.740 --> 32:53.940
Don't be silly.

32:59.620 --> 33:01.260
Neela...

33:01.380 --> 33:02.500
this conversation...

33:02.620 --> 33:03.740
It never happened.

33:03.900 --> 33:05.380
Dr Rasgotra -
perfect timing.

33:05.540 --> 33:06.820
Page the intern.
I'm not really here.

33:06.980 --> 33:09.380
Uh, I got a guy who fell out
of a second storey window,

33:09.580 --> 33:11.140
they need a surgeon
in Trauma One.
All right.

33:11.300 --> 33:13.060
Page Dubenko and
let him know, OK?

33:13.220 --> 33:15.340
I hear you're interviewing
for attending positions

33:15.500 --> 33:16.900
at the trauma
conference today.

33:17.020 --> 33:17.900
You did?

33:18.060 --> 33:19.020
Yeah, Lucien's whining

33:19.180 --> 33:20.780
about losing you
to another institution.

33:20.900 --> 33:21.900
He was?

33:22.060 --> 33:23.500
Don't look so shocked,
you gotta know

33:23.700 --> 33:25.420
he's been grooming you
for a faculty position.
Really?

33:25.580 --> 33:27.260
Cos he's the one
who set up all the interviews.

33:27.460 --> 33:29.180
Neela, that's the game.
What do you mean,
the game?

33:29.340 --> 33:31.580
My brain chemistry's off,
that paralysis thing

33:31.700 --> 33:33.020
doesn't work right.

33:33.140 --> 33:34.220
So you act things out.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.420
Big wave surfing,
car chases,

33:36.580 --> 33:38.180
dragon-slaying -
I've done it all.

33:38.340 --> 33:39.780
On my count -
one, two, three.

33:39.940 --> 33:42.180
Mr Vasquez, please
meet our esteemed

33:42.340 --> 33:44.540
surgical colleague,
Dr Neela Rasgotra.

33:44.540 --> 33:45.380
Hello.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.620
Am I going to need surgery?

33:46.740 --> 33:47.620
I hope not.

33:47.780 --> 33:49.620
Ah. Well, these
seem superficial

33:49.780 --> 33:51.060
but let's get an X-ray
just to be sure.

33:51.180 --> 33:52.020
What did the ultrasound show?

33:52.140 --> 33:53.100
Just called for the machine.

33:53.220 --> 33:54.100
Tib-fib displaced.

33:54.260 --> 33:55.580
I'm going to get
a stryker probe.

33:55.740 --> 33:56.900
Good pedal pulse,
and no swelling.

33:56.900 --> 33:58.260
He doesn't have
compartment syndrome.

33:58.380 --> 33:59.340
Gates missed

33:59.500 --> 34:02.100
a compartment syndrome
last week, he's got

34:02.300 --> 34:03.900
PTSD.
Stay.
That's ridiculous.

34:04.100 --> 34:05.620
It'll take five minutes.
You can't let
a bad case

34:05.780 --> 34:06.820
from last week derail
your focus

34:06.980 --> 34:08.060
on the patient
in front of you, got it?

34:08.219 --> 34:09.540
Whoa, someone ate
their wheaties this morning.

34:12.060 --> 34:14.060
You guys looking for this?
Yeah, thanks.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.500
Rasgotra:
Can we lower the
table, please?

34:15.659 --> 34:17.179
Hey. Haven't
seen you all week.

34:17.340 --> 34:19.739
I know. It's weird.
Yeah. Really weird.

34:19.739 --> 34:22.179
Sam! We need a second
line over here.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.699
I have something that I want
to give you later, OK?

34:28.179 --> 34:29.940
I'm not getting a good
look at the spleen,

34:30.060 --> 34:31.379
but the belly looks clear.

34:31.539 --> 34:32.619
No sign of
internal injuries.

34:32.779 --> 34:35.018
Morris, I'll stay here,
you go run the board.

34:35.018 --> 34:38.458
What? I'm already in on this.
I know, but I am in no mood
to move the meat.

34:38.659 --> 34:39.978
And I have the authority
to do what I want.
"Move the meat"?!

34:41.779 --> 34:43.219
hysterical parents--
they're all yours.

34:43.379 --> 34:44.379
Shoo!

34:44.498 --> 34:45.739
Okay.

34:45.899 --> 34:48.179
I've gotta run to rounds
in the picu.

34:56.699 --> 34:58.659
(panting)

34:59.939 --> 35:01.979
Hi.

35:02.099 --> 35:03.499
How's the new digs?

35:03.619 --> 35:05.339
Okay, except for no TV.

35:05.499 --> 35:07.659
At least you have
your own room up here, right?

35:09.139 --> 35:12.219
Her, uh, oxygen level
is still a bit low.

35:21.219 --> 35:23.099
So what now?

35:23.259 --> 35:27.179
We wait, and hope her own immune
system conquers the infection.

35:27.179 --> 35:29.459
She can do it.
She's tough.

35:29.579 --> 35:31.099
I need you to get better

35:31.219 --> 35:33.099
so you can help me
download Scrabble

35:33.219 --> 35:35.819
on my cell, OK?

35:39.299 --> 35:41.099
Dubenko:
Hey. How's she doing?

35:41.219 --> 35:42.619
On 20 of dopamine.

35:42.779 --> 35:44.699
Sats hanging around 90;
lactate's on the edge.

35:44.859 --> 35:47.299
Well, the next 24 hours
will give us our answer.

35:47.459 --> 35:48.659
Are you off to
your interviews?

35:48.819 --> 35:49.979
Actually, I was thinking
of cancelling.

35:50.139 --> 35:51.739
What, are you crazy?
Well, Ana's my patient.

35:51.859 --> 35:52.899
I should see this through.

35:53.499 --> 35:54.459
No-- go!
I'll take care of it.

35:54.619 --> 35:57.019
I'll call you if
anything changes.

35:57.179 --> 35:59.379
Trauma programs will
be fighting over you.

35:59.499 --> 36:01.499
All right, then.

36:02.579 --> 36:05.659
You know, um, I don't get it.

36:05.659 --> 36:07.459
Get what?

36:07.579 --> 36:09.978
You seem to be dying
to get rid of me.

36:09.978 --> 36:12.338
You keep mumbling about
the hiring freeze at County,

36:12.498 --> 36:15.178
pushing me to do interviews
all over.

36:15.338 --> 36:17.178
But then, I keep
hearing other things.

36:17.298 --> 36:19.338
What other things?

36:19.498 --> 36:22.658
If you want me to stay,
how come you've never asked?

36:22.858 --> 36:25.458
We can't have
this discussion

36:25.618 --> 36:28.298
until you've seen
what else is out there.

36:28.418 --> 36:30.578
I'm serious.

36:30.698 --> 36:33.138
Go. Get out of here.

36:39.218 --> 36:42.418
(Gates humming)

36:42.538 --> 36:44.538
Wow, look at you.

36:44.698 --> 36:46.618
How's our dream walker
guy doing?

36:46.738 --> 36:48.138
Runner. Dream runner.

36:48.298 --> 36:50.258
He's stable,
waiting for ortho.

36:50.378 --> 36:52.058
Good.

36:52.218 --> 36:54.178
You know, I should
be on the el

36:54.338 --> 36:56.098
right now, rushing to
this interview thing,

36:56.258 --> 36:58.298
but instead, I'm here
obsessing over cheese

36:58.298 --> 37:00.378
or ranch. Do you know what else
I'm thinking about?

37:00.378 --> 37:01.378
Twinkies?

37:01.498 --> 37:02.378
Sam.

37:02.538 --> 37:04.938
I think I always sort of
underestimated her.

37:05.058 --> 37:06.378
I feel bad about that.

37:06.538 --> 37:08.978
And you know, you two should
never have broken up.

37:09.138 --> 37:10.578
Yeah, well, it's
sort of complicated,

37:10.738 --> 37:13.418
and I think it's best
if I lay low right now.

37:13.578 --> 37:16.138
Well, inaction is in
and of itself action.

37:16.258 --> 37:17.738
What?

37:17.858 --> 37:19.178
Don't listen to me.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.578
I'm post call,
and you know how I get.

37:21.698 --> 37:25.178
(phone ringing)

37:25.298 --> 37:27.258
Daria.

37:36.458 --> 37:38.458
(sighs)

37:38.738 --> 37:39.938
Hey, stranger.

37:39.938 --> 37:41.178
Well, when did you get back?

37:41.298 --> 37:42.458
Last night.

37:42.618 --> 37:44.778
Sorry. I, uh... I haven't eaten
in, like, 24 hours.

37:44.938 --> 37:46.857
Would you want to go
and get a proper lunch?

37:46.977 --> 37:48.257
Uh... no, I can't.

37:48.417 --> 37:50.097
I've got a bunch
of attending interviews.

37:50.257 --> 37:52.297
Cool.
Is it?

37:52.377 --> 37:53.497
I'm not so sure.

37:53.617 --> 37:55.377
I'm supposed to know things
and have goals,

37:55.537 --> 37:57.977
and how could I have gotten
this far in my life

37:58.137 --> 38:00.417
and have no idea
what I want from my life?

38:02.697 --> 38:05.657
Sorry. I'm rambling.
And self-absorbed.

38:05.777 --> 38:07.337
How was your trip?

38:07.497 --> 38:09.777
Neela, you don't have to know
exactly where you're going.

38:09.937 --> 38:11.457
You just got to
keep moving forward.

38:11.617 --> 38:13.297
That is the key to
happiness, really.

38:13.457 --> 38:15.817
Well, you've got it all
figured out, don't you?

38:15.817 --> 38:16.857
See you later, Simon.

38:20.937 --> 38:22.937
(motorcycle roaring)

38:41.977 --> 38:42.977
Hello. I'm...

38:43.097 --> 38:46.097
Neela Rasgotra.

38:46.217 --> 38:49.737
I'm so glad you're here.

38:54.537 --> 38:57.297
I thought you were in
London all this time.

38:57.417 --> 38:59.417
It was great for a while,

38:59.537 --> 39:01.817
but I'd been gone too long,

39:01.977 --> 39:03.417
and England just
didn't really feel

39:03.537 --> 39:04.817
like my home anymore.

39:04.977 --> 39:06.897
Oh, believe me,
I know what you mean.

39:07.057 --> 39:09.017
And then I got the
call from Duke.

39:09.137 --> 39:10.377
How's Ella doing?

39:10.497 --> 39:12.417
Amazing.

39:12.577 --> 39:14.497
Eight, if you
can believe it.

39:14.617 --> 39:16.697
Oh, wow.

39:16.817 --> 39:17.977
She's beautiful.

39:18.097 --> 39:19.537
(laughs)

39:19.697 --> 39:22.457
Durham's a great
place to raise a kid.

39:22.617 --> 39:25.536
I thought I was gonna miss
the city, but I don't.

39:25.696 --> 39:29.216
So, uh, when
I left County,

39:29.376 --> 39:31.816
you were still doing
emergency medicine.

39:31.936 --> 39:33.576
Yeah, well, I saw the light.

39:33.696 --> 39:34.816
Are you looking mainly

39:34.976 --> 39:37.616
at academic positions
or community hospitals?

39:37.736 --> 39:38.976
Uh, uh, I don't know.

39:39.136 --> 39:40.616
Uh, both, I guess.
Mm-hmm.

39:40.776 --> 39:43.136
And are you hoping to
focus on trauma surgery,

39:43.296 --> 39:45.536
or are you open to
elective cases, as well?

39:45.656 --> 39:46.936
I'm open.

39:46.936 --> 39:49.056
And, uh, do you have
any research areas?

39:49.056 --> 39:51.696
I haven't really
figured any of that out yet.

39:53.096 --> 39:54.696
Not really the sort of thing

39:54.696 --> 39:56.136
one says at a job interview.

39:56.256 --> 39:57.496
No.

39:57.616 --> 39:59.616
But I appreciate the honesty.

40:01.616 --> 40:03.816
So, is Lucien helping you?

40:03.936 --> 40:06.336
Helping me with what?

40:06.456 --> 40:07.496
Figure things out.

40:07.616 --> 40:08.816
(pager beeping)

40:08.936 --> 40:11.776
Uh, sort of, but not really.

40:11.936 --> 40:14.376
I-I don't think
County's really in my future.

40:16.696 --> 40:19.136
County's an amazing place.

40:19.256 --> 40:22.016
What I learned there...

40:25.936 --> 40:29.336
It was a very intense period
in my life.

40:29.336 --> 40:30.896
But it made me the doctor
that I am now,

40:30.896 --> 40:33.176
the person that I am now.

40:33.176 --> 40:35.856
Well, did you ever
consider coming back?

40:35.856 --> 40:38.216
Yes. Briefly.

40:38.376 --> 40:40.536
But there is something
to be said

40:40.696 --> 40:43.056
for getting away from the place
where you trained.

40:43.256 --> 40:45.936
Oh?
They've known you since
you were a medical student.

40:46.016 --> 40:47.056
And at some level,

40:47.216 --> 40:48.656
the faculty will always see you
as little Neela.

40:48.816 --> 40:50.736
You go somewhere new,
you'll be taken seriously

40:50.896 --> 40:53.536
in a way that will not
happen if you stay.

40:53.656 --> 40:55.496
(pager beeping)

40:55.656 --> 40:57.576
You know, you really
should turn that off

40:57.696 --> 40:59.536
during interviews.

40:59.696 --> 41:01.695
Oh. Got to go back
to the hospital.

41:01.895 --> 41:04.215
You don't have someone
covering for you?
Oh, I am so sorry.

41:04.375 --> 41:07.215
Neela, let's just finish up.
We're almost done.

41:07.375 --> 41:08.495
Thank you so much,
Dr. Corday.

41:08.655 --> 41:10.375
Maybe you should come by
and visit County some time.

41:10.495 --> 41:12.375
Yeah.

41:12.495 --> 41:15.095
Maybe sometime I will.

41:22.215 --> 41:24.975
Sam, there's a bunch of
stuff I need to say to you.

41:25.095 --> 41:26.135
Me, too.

41:26.255 --> 41:27.335
I miss our...

41:27.455 --> 41:28.495
These are yours.

41:28.655 --> 41:30.495
Suri: Gates, Morris
is intubating

41:30.615 --> 41:32.535
your sleepwalker guy.

41:32.655 --> 41:34.615
(Gates sighs heavily)

41:36.655 --> 41:37.935
What happened?
Morris: Suction.

41:38.095 --> 41:39.495
Crit dropped,
and he got altered.

41:39.615 --> 41:40.615
I'm in. Bag him.

41:40.775 --> 41:41.815
Banfield:
Sam, call angio.

41:41.935 --> 41:43.015
Tell them we're
on the way.

41:43.175 --> 41:44.335
Gates & Morris:
Angio?

41:44.495 --> 41:45.855
Crit drop,
pelvic fracture.

41:46.015 --> 41:47.735
He needs angio.
What's angio?

41:47.895 --> 41:48.815
(alarm sounds)
Run of V tach.

41:48.935 --> 41:49.975
300 of amiodarone,

41:50.135 --> 41:52.015
hang two units on
the rapid infuser.

41:52.135 --> 41:53.215
Somebody please explain.

41:53.375 --> 41:54.495
Gates:
he's bleeding internally.

41:54.655 --> 41:56.735
We have to find out where fast.
Dr. Banfield,

41:56.895 --> 41:57.975
can I talk to you
outside for a minute?

41:58.135 --> 42:00.495
All right, pack him up!
Let's get ready to move.

42:00.615 --> 42:02.535
(phone ringing)

42:02.535 --> 42:04.615
Hey, Ray.
I'll call you back later, OK?

42:07.615 --> 42:09.975
We can't wait any longer.

42:10.135 --> 42:12.095
Please... I want
Neela here.

42:12.255 --> 42:13.295
(alarms sounding)
Sats 87.

42:13.455 --> 42:15.095
I'm sorry, honey.
We need to do this now.

42:15.215 --> 42:16.295
Ana, honey, you can do this.

42:16.415 --> 42:17.455
You've been through worse.

42:17.575 --> 42:20.055
Please... Mommy... the music.

42:22.535 --> 42:24.295
(Cello playing
classical melody)

42:24.415 --> 42:25.775
I love you, sweetie.

42:25.895 --> 42:27.855
Push the etomidate.

42:37.095 --> 42:40.254
He's bleeding from the belly,
not the pelvis.

42:40.374 --> 42:41.694
He needs a CT.

42:41.854 --> 42:43.894
And if the angio's
negative, he'll get one.

42:44.014 --> 42:45.054
He's about to code.

42:45.214 --> 42:46.494
There's not enough time
for two studies.

42:46.694 --> 42:47.934
We got to make the right
decision right now. Clock is
ticking.

42:47.934 --> 42:49.414
Neela, dropping crit,

42:49.574 --> 42:51.374
status post abdominal trauma
and a non-displaced

42:51.534 --> 42:53.614
pelvic fracture--
what's first, CT or angiogram?

42:53.734 --> 42:54.854
This our dream runner guy?

42:55.014 --> 42:56.254
Yeah.
I'd get a CT.

42:58.334 --> 43:01.494
All right, take him
to the scanner.

43:09.094 --> 43:11.254
Shirley:
Epi's in.
What happened?

43:11.374 --> 43:12.414
Acute chest, sepsis.

43:12.614 --> 43:14.654
She started third spacing
everywhere.

43:14.814 --> 43:15.974
Still PEA.
(pager sounds)

43:16.094 --> 43:17.374
Code team page.

43:17.534 --> 43:19.694
Ana, honey, please,
I know you hear me.

43:19.854 --> 43:21.334
(Voice breaking):
Don't do this, OK?

43:21.534 --> 43:22.614
This is my fault.
It's the
infection's fault.

43:22.774 --> 43:24.094
You wanted to take
her to the O.R.

43:24.254 --> 43:25.494
You knew this was
the wrong call.

43:25.654 --> 43:27.574
We could've been screwed
either way-- we made a choice.

43:27.734 --> 43:29.374
You can't control
what happens after that.

43:29.534 --> 43:31.454
Shirley: I'll be
there when I can.

43:31.614 --> 43:33.574
Full arrest in the scanner; some
guy jumped through a window.

43:33.574 --> 43:34.894
Ana, stay with us, OK?
please.

43:34.894 --> 43:36.854
Get me
the transcutaneous pacer.

43:36.974 --> 43:38.974
(panting)

43:40.694 --> 43:43.094
Hold compressions.

43:45.534 --> 43:48.494
This is over.

47:46.291 --> 47:47.771
A Garnier first,

47:47.891 --> 47:50.291
inspired by the beauty
and resilience of orchids.

47:50.971 --> 47:52.451
New Garnier
Vital Restore

47:52.531 --> 47:53.691
for mature skin.

47:53.771 --> 47:55.531
Enriched with...

47:57.491 --> 47:59.811
..it's proven to help restore
a look of skin vitality.

47:59.891 --> 48:01.531
Skin's structure feels reinforced.

48:01.611 --> 48:02.691
It's intensely hydrated

48:02.811 --> 48:03.931
and better
protected

48:04.051 --> 48:05.331
against
age spots.

48:05.411 --> 48:06.691
It really works.

48:06.811 --> 48:09.171
And chosen by thousands
of British women already.

48:11.531 --> 48:13.811
Reinforce skin. Restore vitality.

49:07.171 --> 49:10.171
Rasgotra:
For some patients,
there is no road to recovery.

49:10.171 --> 49:13.010
Nothing we do as doctors
will alter the outcome.

49:13.010 --> 49:15.530
At least
that's what we tell ourselves.

49:24.690 --> 49:27.890
(phone ringing)

49:29.250 --> 49:31.410
Ray, it's 5:00 a.m.

49:31.410 --> 49:34.690
B-l-u-e.

49:34.690 --> 49:36.490
One, two, three.
Hey, at this point,

49:36.490 --> 49:38.450
removing the source
of infection is our best option.

49:38.450 --> 49:40.650
You mean taking out
my gall bladder, right?

49:40.810 --> 49:42.850
Let's finally
get you better, OK?

49:43.010 --> 49:45.290
Hurry up,
I'm getting sick of you people.

49:45.410 --> 49:47.850
I'm gonna go call your mom.

49:47.930 --> 49:50.210
Hang in there, Ana.

49:50.370 --> 49:52.010
I'll check on you
in a little while.

49:52.170 --> 49:53.450
Don't you want
to hear your fortune?

49:53.610 --> 49:56.610
I'll be back soon,
I promise.

49:56.770 --> 49:58.490
Rasgotra:
When their way doesn't work,

49:58.610 --> 49:59.970
and your way doesn't work,

50:00.090 --> 50:02.570
you've got to accept defeat.

50:02.690 --> 50:04.930
Or... find another way.

50:05.090 --> 50:07.730
What about
percutaneous drainage?

50:07.890 --> 50:09.250
Maybe the pus
re-accumulated

50:09.370 --> 50:10.290
or she developed an abscess.

50:10.450 --> 50:11.290
Not likely.

50:11.410 --> 50:12.770
Less anesthesia, lower risk,

50:12.930 --> 50:15.290
might still allow us to remove
the nidus of infection.

50:15.410 --> 50:16.450
Okay, then what?

50:16.610 --> 50:17.490
We switch her
to synercid,

50:17.650 --> 50:18.330
watch her in the Picu, and...
Fine.

50:18.330 --> 50:20.170
Set it up. I'll meet you
in the picu in ten.

50:20.370 --> 50:21.650
Really?
Yeah, you're almost
an attending.

50:21.810 --> 50:23.370
I need to start listening
to you.

50:43.770 --> 50:45.810
Rasgotra:
Ray, happy birthday.

50:45.930 --> 50:47.450
No, I didn't forget.

50:47.610 --> 50:48.770
Geez, man,
I've never heard

50:48.930 --> 50:51.249
of someone being so psyched
to turn 30.

50:51.409 --> 50:53.529
I'll call you back
later, OK?

50:53.689 --> 50:57.249
Big wave surfing,
car chases, dragon slaying--

50:57.369 --> 50:59.009
I've done it all.

50:59.169 --> 51:00.129
Neela, Dr. Dubenko
says hurry.

51:00.289 --> 51:01.329
He's in IR
with your girl.

51:01.489 --> 51:02.769
I'm not getting a good look
at the spleen.

51:02.929 --> 51:04.929
Sam, will you hand me
the DPL kit, please?

51:05.049 --> 51:06.169
Are you serious?

51:06.329 --> 51:07.329
We don't do DPLs any more.

51:07.489 --> 51:08.769
It will give us
a fast answer

51:08.929 --> 51:09.969
and spare him
the radiation.

51:10.129 --> 51:11.289
Ten blade,
betadine, and lido.

51:11.409 --> 51:12.529
Come on.

51:12.689 --> 51:13.929
I'll give you a
hand with that.

51:14.089 --> 51:15.569
Here you go.
Thanks.

51:15.769 --> 51:17.409
Hey, listen, you know
those Hawks tickets
that we bought?

51:17.529 --> 51:18.649
Yeah, what about 'em?

51:18.769 --> 51:19.809
Well, the game's coming up,

51:19.929 --> 51:21.849
and, um, I was thinking
maybe I could take Alex,

51:22.049 --> 51:23.289
if you were cool
with that.
Taggart: I don't know.

51:23.289 --> 51:24.809
Well, he loves hockey,
and...

51:24.969 --> 51:27.089
it'd give us a little guy
time, give you the night off.

51:27.209 --> 51:29.089
I'll think about it.

51:31.049 --> 51:33.369
Morris:
Fluid's pink.

51:33.569 --> 51:36.089
What's that mean?
it means you have internal
bleeding and you're going

51:36.249 --> 51:38.009
to need an operation
to repair the injury.

51:38.249 --> 51:40.849
Wow.
Well, we got it in time, so
we're gonna be able to fix

51:41.009 --> 51:42.009
everything up.
Morris,

51:42.169 --> 51:44.169
let the O.R. know, OK?
Dubenko's waiting for me.

51:45.209 --> 51:47.969
NPO and check the crit Q30.

51:48.089 --> 51:49.009
What the hell was that?

51:49.129 --> 51:50.289
What was what?

51:50.449 --> 51:53.489
Gates following Sam around
like a puppy in there.

51:53.649 --> 51:55.689
Guy does not know
how to play it cool.

51:55.849 --> 51:59.769
Dr. Morris. Come with
me, it's important.

52:04.209 --> 52:06.249
Sorry, Ana, I got stuck in the ER.

52:06.249 --> 52:07.169
Dubenko:
There, that's the liver.

52:07.289 --> 52:08.169
Good.

52:08.289 --> 52:09.889
Aspirating.

52:10.009 --> 52:11.889
Sats up to 92.

52:15.929 --> 52:16.809
Wow.

52:16.929 --> 52:17.849
What?

52:18.009 --> 52:19.809
A lot of purulent
material here.

52:19.969 --> 52:21.609
You should go; I don't
want you to be late

52:21.809 --> 52:23.689
for your interviews.
I can't leave
in the middle of this.

52:23.849 --> 52:25.249
It'll be hours before
we know anything here.

52:25.369 --> 52:26.409
Go and mingle.

52:26.569 --> 52:28.849
All the top trauma
programs will be there.

52:29.009 --> 52:30.608
Flush.
If you say so.

52:30.768 --> 52:32.008
And when you've weighed
all your options,

52:32.168 --> 52:34.008
I hope you
decide to stay.

52:34.088 --> 52:35.328
What?

52:35.448 --> 52:36.528
Assistant professor--

52:36.688 --> 52:39.048
full benefits, research
and admin time.

52:39.208 --> 52:41.448
You'll get an official
offer letter in a few weeks.

52:41.568 --> 52:43.528
Lucien.

52:43.648 --> 52:44.808
Whatever happens,

52:44.968 --> 52:47.808
you got a backup
plan here.

52:47.968 --> 52:49.968
I don't know what to say.
Shut up and go.

53:04.008 --> 53:05.048
Gates:
Wow, look at you.

53:05.048 --> 53:06.728
Where are you going?
Bunch of job interviews.

53:06.728 --> 53:08.208
I'm late.
Good luck.

53:08.208 --> 53:09.248
Hey, um, did our dream runner
guy make it to the O.R. yet?

53:09.248 --> 53:10.888
No, the beds were
full; he's next.
Will you do me

53:10.888 --> 53:12.568
a favor and repeat the
ultrasound, making sure you stay

53:12.728 --> 53:14.408
ahead of the blood loss?
Yep.

53:19.488 --> 53:21.448
Hello, Neela.

53:21.568 --> 53:22.808
You're back.

53:24.208 --> 53:27.088
I'm, uh, so sorry.

53:27.248 --> 53:30.008
I'm late for these interviews
and I have to get the train.

53:30.128 --> 53:31.088
I can't believe this.

53:31.248 --> 53:32.128
Yeah,
I had the guy

53:32.288 --> 53:34.688
replace all
the chrome...

53:35.808 --> 53:38.088
Do you mind
if we borrow your bike?

53:43.528 --> 53:46.888
You know, surfing, barbecues,
all the usual January stuff.

53:46.888 --> 53:48.048
Bastard.

53:48.048 --> 53:52.608
Still, I missed this dark, cold,
miserable place every day.

53:52.608 --> 53:55.528
Really? And what, exactly,
did you miss?

53:55.528 --> 53:56.328
I don't know.

53:57.008 --> 54:01.128
It wasn't the weather
or, uh, my apartment.

54:01.248 --> 54:02.448
It wasn't even
the job really,

54:02.608 --> 54:06.488
although, there is
a certain surgeon--

54:06.648 --> 54:08.647
am I, uh,
am I boring you?

54:11.927 --> 54:14.407
I couldn't seem
to get her out of my head.

54:20.607 --> 54:24.407
You, doctor...

54:24.527 --> 54:27.367
need to go.

54:27.487 --> 54:29.607
I do?

54:29.727 --> 54:31.167
Oh, I do.

54:31.327 --> 54:33.447
You're going to kick ass
in there, Neela, I know it.

54:33.567 --> 54:36.967
Simon, I missed you, too.

54:36.967 --> 54:38.727
A little.

54:46.687 --> 54:48.767
O.R. is going to be
another hour, at least.

54:48.967 --> 54:50.767
All right.
You just did that
ten minutes ago.

54:50.927 --> 54:53.127
I know, but I promised
Neela I'd check again.

54:53.247 --> 54:55.127
I don't feel so good.

54:55.247 --> 54:56.127
He looks pale.

54:56.247 --> 54:57.727
Don't you think he looks pale?

54:57.887 --> 54:58.807
Gates:
All right, Sam,

54:58.967 --> 55:00.087
hang two units on
the rapid infuser

55:00.247 --> 55:02.127
and please call
the O.R. again.

55:02.247 --> 55:04.047
What? What is it?

55:04.047 --> 55:06.007
So the next thing you need
to do is come visit Durham.

55:06.167 --> 55:08.207
Can you really see me
living down south?

55:08.327 --> 55:09.527
It's a lovely city.

55:09.687 --> 55:12.047
It's much more cultured
than you'd think.

55:12.167 --> 55:13.167
Simon.

55:13.287 --> 55:14.167
How'd it go?

55:14.287 --> 55:15.167
Uh...

55:15.287 --> 55:17.127
very well, I'd say.

55:17.287 --> 55:18.767
Uh, Simon,
this is Elizabeth Corday,

55:19.007 --> 55:20.047
chief of trauma surgery
at Duke;

55:20.207 --> 55:22.207
and Simon is an ER
attending at County.

55:22.327 --> 55:23.767
Nice to meet you.

55:24.847 --> 55:26.447
Neela, give me a call

55:26.567 --> 55:29.447
when you've thought about things
and we'll talk details.

55:29.567 --> 55:31.127
Take her out
for some champagne.

55:34.767 --> 55:36.487
That sounds
like you killed it.

55:38.607 --> 55:40.607
I don't know, you spend
all these years scrambling

55:40.767 --> 55:44.607
for the privilege of
becoming a doctor.

55:44.767 --> 55:47.246
It feels crazy to be,
you know, wanted.

55:47.366 --> 55:48.646
Well, get used to it.

55:51.486 --> 55:53.086
What's this?

56:10.126 --> 56:11.646
Second unit's up.

56:11.806 --> 56:13.086
Banfield:
I'm in, call for a vent.

56:13.246 --> 56:14.086
Introducer.
45 minutes

56:14.246 --> 56:15.846
till they can give us
an O.R.

56:16.006 --> 56:17.846
That's too long.
We'll never keep up.

56:18.006 --> 56:19.566
Well, what choice do we have?
Sam, get a second infuser.

56:19.686 --> 56:20.846
I'll hang an IJ.

56:21.006 --> 56:22.366
I've got the subclavian.
We'll dump in the blood

56:22.526 --> 56:24.726
and the FFP
until the room is ready.

56:24.806 --> 56:25.766
Nick, hang on, OK?

56:25.886 --> 56:26.766
I need you.

56:26.886 --> 56:28.006
Oliver needs you.

56:28.166 --> 56:30.686
Taggart:
V tach, no pulse.

56:30.846 --> 56:32.366
You're charged.
Mig of epi.

56:32.526 --> 56:34.406
All right.
Clear.

56:36.806 --> 56:37.686
Units 11 and 12 are up.

56:37.806 --> 56:38.846
Clear.

56:39.006 --> 56:40.726
Morris: No change.
Resume compressions.

56:40.846 --> 56:50.326
Please, baby, don't do this.

56:50.326 --> 56:52.166
Okay, enough.

56:52.326 --> 56:55.486
Sterile sevens
and a thoracotomy tray.

56:55.646 --> 56:57.686
I cannot bear another
one of these right now.

56:57.806 --> 57:00.166
Another what?

57:00.366 --> 57:03.686
What are you doing?
A room shortage is
a stupid reason to die.

57:03.846 --> 57:08.286
I will clamp the aorta and
fix this myself, if I have to.

57:09.286 --> 57:11.006
Well, all right.

57:14.886 --> 57:16.766
Where are you going?

57:16.926 --> 57:21.006
I have to go to the hospital
and check on a patient.

57:22.046 --> 57:23.926
You are kidding.

57:24.086 --> 57:25.765
Have one of the
interns do it.

57:25.925 --> 57:29.005
Just stay here;
I'll be back in an hour.

57:29.125 --> 57:30.645
And don't say it.

57:30.765 --> 57:31.645
Say what?

57:31.765 --> 57:33.845
You know what.

57:36.645 --> 57:39.045
I told you so.

57:42.085 --> 57:43.085
Aah, it keeps slipping.

57:43.205 --> 57:44.285
Try a bigger clamp.

57:44.445 --> 57:47.085
The heart's
barely filling.

57:47.245 --> 57:48.165
(Banfield grunting
with effort)

57:52.525 --> 57:55.565
(phone ringing)

58:03.005 --> 58:04.525
I got it!

58:04.685 --> 58:06.605
All right, run in another litre
and shock him again.

58:06.725 --> 58:07.685
All right.

58:13.845 --> 58:15.765
Gates:
Clear!

58:16.205 --> 58:17.805
Sounds like you guys could use
a surgeon.

58:17.965 --> 58:20.205
Back in sinus.
Hallelujah.

58:20.365 --> 58:21.765
(weeping):
Thank you.

58:23.725 --> 58:25.405
After I ran into you,
I came back and checked.

58:25.525 --> 58:27.165
He was bleeding out.

58:27.325 --> 58:28.845
Another five minutes, it could
have gone the other way.

58:28.965 --> 58:30.565
This isn't a done deal.

58:30.725 --> 58:31.565
Okay, well,
let's get him upstairs

58:31.685 --> 58:34.085
while he's still got a pulse.

58:40.325 --> 58:42.245
(sighs)

58:42.365 --> 58:43.445
Hey, Tony.

58:46.085 --> 58:48.925
I'm sure Alex would love to go
to that Hawks game with you.

58:49.045 --> 58:50.485
Thank you.

58:50.605 --> 58:51.925
Any time.

58:58.845 --> 59:00.725
Get some sleep, Ana.

59:00.725 --> 59:02.405
No more 2:00 a.m. Guitar
Hero with the clerks.

59:02.405 --> 59:03.484
I'll see you
in the morning.

59:03.484 --> 59:06.124
Don't you want
to hear your fortune?

59:06.124 --> 59:08.644
Sheila:
it can wait, honey.

59:08.644 --> 59:09.804
She's been awake
for two days.

59:09.964 --> 59:11.604
Yeah, go home
already.

59:12.804 --> 59:16.324
"Your actions are
the seeds of fate."

59:16.484 --> 59:19.404
Not exactly a fortune--
more of a theory, really--

59:19.524 --> 59:21.444
but I'll take it.

59:21.604 --> 59:23.444
Dubenko:
hey...

59:23.604 --> 59:25.324
you never did
my fortune.

59:25.484 --> 59:27.724
Pick a colour and a number
between one and ten.

59:27.844 --> 59:29.164
Good night, guys.

59:29.284 --> 59:31.204
Rounds are at 7:00.

59:31.324 --> 59:34.804
Okay, green and six.

59:34.924 --> 59:36.484
G-r-e-e-n.

59:36.644 --> 59:40.284
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

59:40.404 --> 59:41.364
Open this?

01:00:01.004 --> 01:00:03.204
Subtitles by WGBH

01:01:29.763 --> 01:01:33.003
Uh, this one's crooked.
Yeah, so's this one.

01:01:37.203 --> 01:01:40.243
Sorry, sir, that one's broken.
(rattles the contents)

01:01:40.243 --> 01:01:42.163
Can you hear that?

01:01:43.843 --> 01:01:45.963
New Crunchy Nut Bites

01:01:45.963 --> 01:01:49.883
Delicious golden cereal baked with
crunchy nuts and chewy caramel.
