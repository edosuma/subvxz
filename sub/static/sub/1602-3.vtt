00:02.457 --> 00:04.108
How do you expect me to
have a relationship with you

00:04.132 --> 00:05.432
under the circumstances.

00:05.534 --> 00:07.201
Norman never has to know I'm here.

00:07.302 --> 00:08.302
You're my son.

00:08.336 --> 00:10.137
This is Annika. Room four.

00:10.238 --> 00:11.939
(woman) When is the last time you saw her?

00:12.040 --> 00:13.908
(Emma) Last night. She was
going somewhere in town.

00:14.009 --> 00:15.849
Norman drove with her
to show her where it was.

00:15.943 --> 00:17.511
(Norma) Why did you lie to me?

00:17.612 --> 00:18.946
You shouldn't have gotten
in the car with her, Norman.

00:19.047 --> 00:20.381
Why?

00:20.482 --> 00:21.849
Because you can't keep getting into cars

00:21.950 --> 00:22.950
with questionable women.

00:22.984 --> 00:24.621
- You're being ridiculous.
- I'm not!

00:24.671 --> 00:26.305
I mean, look what happened
with Blaire Watson.

00:26.406 --> 00:28.493
(Emma) Have you thought
about looking in her room?

00:28.530 --> 00:29.831
Maybe something in there

00:29.932 --> 00:31.612
would give us an idea of where she's gone.

00:31.634 --> 00:32.934
(Norma) What's The Arcanum Club?

00:33.035 --> 00:35.336
(Emma) It's a hunting club. Very exclusive.

00:35.437 --> 00:37.357
What does any of this
have to do with you, Norma?

00:37.373 --> 00:38.673
There's a young woman.

00:38.774 --> 00:40.275
She's a guest at my motel.

00:40.376 --> 00:41.736
She's been missing for two nights.

00:41.744 --> 00:43.211
When did you see her last?

00:43.312 --> 00:44.946
Norman was the last person who saw her.

00:45.047 --> 00:46.581
- He drove into town with her...

I'm sorry I have to ask you to do this.

They... uh... they found her
floating in the tidal flats.

Okay.

03:01.717 --> 03:03.351
It wasn't her.

03:03.452 --> 03:05.453
- It wasn't?
- Nope.

03:05.554 --> 03:08.723
Did the girl look like her?

03:08.824 --> 03:11.659
Sort of. Kind of hard to tell...

03:11.760 --> 03:13.461
Are you sure it wasn't her?

03:13.562 --> 03:15.897
For the love of God, yeah,
I'm sure it wasn't her.

03:15.998 --> 03:18.238
Well, did the sheriff say
anything about where Annika is?

03:18.333 --> 03:19.567
Why would he, Norman?

03:19.668 --> 03:21.269
He doesn't know where the girl is.

03:21.370 --> 03:22.804
He's been busy with the other dead girl.

of thinking about it,

03:30.379 --> 03:32.647

none of you were drawn
to learn about psychology

13:55.146 --> 13:58.148
[conversation continues indistinctly]

14:02.287 --> 14:04.421
So when you spoke to her,

14:04.522 --> 14:07.357
did... uh... did Annika tell
you that she was a prostitute?

14:07.458 --> 14:09.159
Not explicitly.

14:09.260 --> 14:11.562
No. But I... I got the impression she was.

14:11.663 --> 14:13.564
I mean, she said she
was working at a party.

14:13.665 --> 14:16.733
I didn't think she was a magician.

14:16.835 --> 14:19.269
But, yeah, I... I think she was trying

14:19.370 --> 14:21.338
to let me know that she was a prostitute.

14:21.439 --> 14:23.273
Wh... wh... why do you
think she, uh, she would have

14:23.374 --> 14:24.408
wanted you to know that?

14:24.509 --> 14:28.111
I really don't know.

14:28.213 --> 14:31.315
We... we were just talking. I..

14:31.416 --> 14:35.252
Well, I told her about how hard
things had been for my mother.

14:35.353 --> 14:36.687
Maybe because I opened up to her,

14:36.788 --> 14:40.824
she... she felt like opening up to me.

14:40.925 --> 14:42.693
Maybe she's lonely.

14:44.562 --> 14:48.732
God, yeah, I... I imagine
that's a pretty lonely life.

14:48.833 --> 14:51.101
Yeah.

14:51.202 --> 14:53.503
Yeah, no, I... I imagine it is.

14:56.674 --> 14:59.576
Women... women seem to trust you.

14:59.677 --> 15:02.179
They do?

15:02.280 --> 15:06.383
Well, I'm thinking of Blaire Watson.

15:06.484 --> 15:09.052
Now she trusted you...

15:09.153 --> 15:11.154
I like women.

15:13.191 --> 15:16.760
Maybe from spending so many
years so close to my mother...

15:16.861 --> 15:19.663
Yeah, maybe.

15:23.601 --> 15:26.670
So did, uh, did Annika seem anxious?

15:26.771 --> 15:28.672
No more than most women, you know?

15:28.773 --> 15:31.208
Have you met my mother?

15:34.345 --> 15:35.779
Did she say she had any troubles?

15:35.880 --> 15:38.215
No, uh...

15:38.316 --> 15:41.251
No, she just said she was
going to meet a friend.

15:41.352 --> 15:43.654
She didn't say who.

15:43.755 --> 15:46.757
And I drove with her to
show her where the bar was.

15:46.858 --> 15:48.578
And then she asked me to drive her car back

15:48.593 --> 15:50.861
'cause she was planning on indulging

15:50.962 --> 15:53.330
on alcohol.

15:53.431 --> 15:54.498
When you dropped her off,

15:54.599 --> 15:56.500
did you see the person she was meeting?

15:56.601 --> 15:59.169
No.

16:01.139 --> 16:04.207
I... I want to show you a picture

16:04.309 --> 16:06.810
and you tell me if you saw anyone

16:06.911 --> 16:10.547
outside the bar or arriving
that looked like this

16:10.648 --> 16:13.317
at the time you dropped Annika off.

16:23.428 --> 16:26.163
No, I've never seen that woman.

16:26.264 --> 16:29.232
Have you interrogated all
the weirdoes in this town?

16:29.334 --> 16:30.614
Because I'm sure any one of them

16:30.668 --> 16:32.308
can tell you much more than what we know.

16:32.370 --> 16:33.704
There's no "we" in this, Mother.

16:33.805 --> 16:35.305
He's asking me questions.

16:35.406 --> 16:38.075
No, I'm... I'm almost done.

16:38.176 --> 16:41.545
Did Annika ever mention a
place called The Arcanum Club,

16:41.646 --> 16:43.413
or a guy named Bob Paris?

16:43.514 --> 16:45.882
No.

16:49.320 --> 16:51.388
No.

16:57.528 --> 16:59.363
I'm really sorry.

16:59.464 --> 17:03.233
I wish, uh... I wish I... I wish
we could've been of more help.

17:03.334 --> 17:04.601
All right, well, if you
remember anything else,

17:04.702 --> 17:06.169
if anything comes to mind

17:06.270 --> 17:08.070
about your interaction with Annika Johnson,

17:08.172 --> 17:09.205
you call me right away.

17:09.307 --> 17:11.907
- Of course, Sheriff.
- We will.

17:14.444 --> 17:16.380
Have a nice dinner.

17:23.887 --> 17:26.323
How can you treat me like
that way in front of someone?

17:26.424 --> 17:27.824
I'm just looking out for you.

17:27.925 --> 17:29.259
I know exactly what you're doing.

17:29.360 --> 17:30.727
Stop it.

17:30.828 --> 17:32.429
Oh really, Mister Smartypants?

17:32.530 --> 17:35.065
What am I doing that
you know so much about?

17:35.166 --> 17:38.535
Why did you tell Sheriff Romero
that I was the last person

17:38.636 --> 17:40.237
to see Annika before she went missing?

17:40.338 --> 17:42.706
- I didn't.
- No, I heard you!

17:44.809 --> 17:46.843
I don't know, Norman. It just came out.

17:46.944 --> 17:48.845
But at a party?

17:48.946 --> 17:51.681
It just hardly seems like party talk.

17:51.783 --> 17:54.551
And why were you at a party?

17:54.652 --> 17:56.612
Hmm? Maybe that would help
us understand all this.

17:56.687 --> 17:58.188
Was that possibly the night

17:58.289 --> 18:00.057
you were all dressed up and decided to go

18:00.158 --> 18:02.793
knock down the bypass sign?

18:02.894 --> 18:05.228
Yes.

18:05.329 --> 18:07.597
So why did you go to the party that night?

18:07.698 --> 18:10.367
Maybe because I told
you that Annika was here

18:10.468 --> 18:13.570
to work at a party and
you wanted to look for her.

18:13.671 --> 18:15.138
And that, for some reason,

18:15.239 --> 18:17.274
Romero was there and you got all agitated

18:17.375 --> 18:20.544
and felt like you had to tell
him what you were worried about.

18:20.645 --> 18:22.679
That's really the point
of everything, isn't it?

18:22.780 --> 18:26.083
- What you're worried about...
- Norman stop it.

18:26.184 --> 18:28.552
No, no, maybe you should
stop telling lies about me.

18:28.653 --> 18:30.520
I wasn't the last person to see her.

18:30.621 --> 18:34.524
I dropped her at that
bar. She met a friend.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.726
Okay, Norman.

18:38.663 --> 18:41.131
I think one of us has a problem.

18:41.232 --> 18:44.868
And I'm tired of the
assumption being that it's me.

19:01.256 --> 19:02.490
- Hey.
- Hello.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.325
Is Dylan here?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.227
No. He's not. Do you
want to leave a message?

19:06.295 --> 19:08.763
- I've got his delivery.
- I can sign for it.

19:08.864 --> 19:10.998
It's not that kind of delivery.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.307
Wow. That's a lot of...

19:19.408 --> 19:21.742

19:21.844 --> 19:24.946

Um, if I give you directions

19:26.682 --> 19:28.316
can you bring them up to Dylan's farm?

19:28.417 --> 19:29.784
No can do.

19:29.852 --> 19:31.619
The less I know the grow spots, the better.

19:31.687 --> 19:34.388
You take the delivery or I take 'em back.

19:34.490 --> 19:36.390
Either way is cool.

- For being a dick yesterday.

wouldn't get out of my seat,

it, but if it's the former,
