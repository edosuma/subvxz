WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.468
- This won't be a easy course.

00:03.604 --> 00:06.605
Now I have to be
honest witchu.

00:06.741 --> 00:13.278
Some of y'all won't make it.
You just won't.

00:13.414 --> 00:18.083
You got to have what it takes
to make it in this class.

00:18.219 --> 00:21.153
You wanna be famous?
This is where you start.

00:21.288 --> 00:22.821
Okay, rule number one?

00:22.823 --> 00:25.024
We don't start nothing in here
we can't finish.

00:25.159 --> 00:29.162
Can you dig it?
Lisa, pay attention.

00:29.296 --> 00:30.896
- She's not following
the rules.

00:31.032 --> 00:32.031
She isn't even a kid.

00:32.166 --> 00:33.966
- I'm so embarrassed right now.

00:34.101 --> 00:37.903
I thought "Cooking for Kids"
was for people like me.

00:38.039 --> 00:40.439
- Oh, ho, ho! Baby, 'cause you
getting ready to get a gift.

00:40.575 --> 00:43.376
You sure got one in there.
Well, I'ma let you stay.

00:43.510 --> 00:46.245
You can just be
my sous chef, okay?

00:46.381 --> 00:48.381
- My mother told me that
if you're pregnant

00:48.515 --> 00:51.183
and you ain't married,
then you fast.

00:51.318 --> 00:52.317
Are you married?

00:52.453 --> 00:54.186
- Nope.
- Vroom, vroom.

00:54.321 --> 00:55.388
- What'd you mean
"vroom, vroom," Wyatt?

00:55.522 --> 00:57.990
How you think you got here?

00:58.125 --> 00:59.725
What you're gonna do
is plant these seeds.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.727
In a few weeks, we're gonna
have some fresh basil

01:01.862 --> 01:03.328
for my pasta sauce, okay?

01:03.330 --> 01:04.997
All of you will
get seeds to plant.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.132
And you gotta get
your feet elevated.

01:07.134 --> 01:10.203
I see them ankles is swollen.
Cankles!

01:10.337 --> 01:12.004
But that's the blessing
that God gave--

01:12.139 --> 01:15.540
- Dang, Mr. Barker, your belly
almost as big as hers.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.210
Your feet should be up too!
- Mm-hmm.

01:17.344 --> 01:19.745
I know that's right.
My sciatica is killing me.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.013
- Sciatica?

01:21.148 --> 01:22.648
Is that what you're
gonna name your baby?

01:31.158 --> 01:32.425

01:32.559 --> 01:34.093
- Y'all did a great job
with this basil

01:34.228 --> 01:35.895
the last three weeks,
especially you, Raul.

01:36.030 --> 01:37.696
I see how hard you work.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.498
Digging that dirt out
and all that, I like that, man.

01:39.634 --> 01:41.300
Big ups, you know?
Know what I'm saying?

01:41.302 --> 01:42.501
And speaking of seed planters,

01:42.503 --> 01:45.104
Felicia,
your baby daddy's here.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.639
- What's up, baby?

01:46.774 --> 01:49.508
- Yo, my man, when you gonna
put a ring on it?

01:49.510 --> 01:51.576
- No. Wyatt, don't do that.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.779
That's not cool to put a man
on blast like that.

01:53.914 --> 01:56.315
Demar, when are you
gonna marry the girl?

01:56.451 --> 01:58.383
- Yo, go ahead
with that, old head.

01:58.385 --> 01:59.584
Watch your business, B.

01:59.586 --> 02:01.186
- Mr. Barker was telling me

02:01.188 --> 02:03.456
about some prenatal classes
they have.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.057
I think we should
at least look into it.

02:05.192 --> 02:07.993
- Yeah, look into it, Demar.
- And you need to do it soon,

02:07.995 --> 02:10.463
'cause the way Felicia look,
she about to pop.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.531
- You got any advice
for making bank?

02:12.533 --> 02:15.400
'Cause that's the only type of
prenatal classes that I need.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.570
Come on. Let's get out of here.
- Felicia!

02:18.739 --> 02:20.273
Take care.

02:28.950 --> 02:30.415
- I'm so dreading this trip.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.617
- If I had some rich
white parents,

02:31.752 --> 02:33.418
I'd be at their estate all day,

02:33.420 --> 02:35.154
every day,
butt-naked in the pool

02:35.290 --> 02:37.156
drinking Snapple
with a gold straw.

02:37.292 --> 02:38.757
- Well, you don't know
my parents.

02:38.759 --> 02:41.026
They still treat me
like I'm an addict.

02:41.028 --> 02:43.162
You know what it's like
when people assume who you are

02:43.164 --> 02:44.497
and don't give you a chance.

02:44.632 --> 02:46.231
- Every day of my life.
- I wish my parents

02:46.233 --> 02:48.033
were more like you
and didn't judge people.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.169
- Don't get it twisted, man.
I judge people.

02:50.305 --> 02:52.104
I had a aunt named Gertrude.

02:52.239 --> 02:54.439
She smoked crack
for four months.

02:54.575 --> 02:58.177
Matter of fact, I sold it
to her sometimes, right?

02:58.313 --> 03:00.379
Getting high all day.

03:00.515 --> 03:04.517
She cleaned herself up, became
a devout Jehovah's Witness

03:04.651 --> 03:06.451
giving out them books early
in the morning and all that.

03:06.587 --> 03:07.853
But every time
she come to my crib,

03:07.989 --> 03:09.254
I still hide all my stuff.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.789
I don't want nothing
coming up missing.

03:10.925 --> 03:13.392
One time, she bought me
a Gameboy for Christmas

03:13.528 --> 03:15.794
and then stole it,
then helped me look for it.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.930
I said, "Why do you buy me
a Gameboy, then steal it,

03:18.065 --> 03:19.665
then help me look for it?"

03:19.800 --> 03:23.268
She said, "I had to eliminate
myself as a suspect."

03:23.270 --> 03:25.204
- All right.

03:25.206 --> 03:27.540
- Whoo! I am so excited.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.208
I can't wait to see
what Nonni and Peepaw

03:29.210 --> 03:30.876
got me as my college gift.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.211
- Don't you mean us?

03:32.347 --> 03:34.013
- They love me way more
than they love you.

03:34.015 --> 03:37.282
- No, they don't.
- Hey, please, stop fighting.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.951
Don't make this worse
than it's gonna be.

03:39.086 --> 03:40.152
Okay?
Get in the car.

03:40.287 --> 03:41.486
- Not before you
get your lunch.

03:41.488 --> 03:42.555
I made yours spicy,

03:42.690 --> 03:44.623
and I put a pack of gum
in there,

03:44.625 --> 03:46.291
'cause you don't want to be
talking to them white people

03:46.427 --> 03:48.761
when your breath smell
like buffalo shit.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.430
And yours is pulled pork.
I put it on white bread.

03:51.566 --> 03:53.632
If you don't eat that before
you get up to Schenectady,

03:53.634 --> 03:55.168
just throw it out the window.

03:55.302 --> 03:56.501
Maybe a brown bear'll eat it
or something.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.103
- Might as well
just eat it now.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.838
- Naw, let it marinate.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.841
- All right, go to the car.
I'll meet you out there. Okay?

04:02.977 --> 04:05.911
- You eat it when you get past
Poughkeepsie or Bayonne.

04:06.047 --> 04:07.580
- Thank you.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.182
- Josh, I made you
some comfort food.

04:09.316 --> 04:12.317
- Wow.
- Peanut butter and jelly.

04:12.319 --> 04:15.388
Roll that around on your grill,
and I dare you not to be happy.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.522
- This will help, definitely.
- Mm-hmm.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.192
Yo, listen. I used up all
the peanut butter and jelly.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.394
I'll get you some
while y'all out.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.396
- No, you don't
have to do that.

04:23.530 --> 04:27.933
Alexa, add peanut butter
and jelly to the grocery list.

04:28.069 --> 04:30.135
<i> - I have added peanut butter</i>

04:34.675 --> 04:36.742
- Well, since you add it
with the magic lady,

04:36.877 --> 04:39.212
I used up all the bread too,
so tell her to cop some bread.

04:39.346 --> 04:42.681
- Alexa, add bread
to the grocery list.

04:42.817 --> 04:45.417
<i> - Bread added</i>
<i> to your grocery list.</i>

04:46.020 --> 04:47.486

04:47.488 --> 04:49.221
Yo, Josh, man.
Dig this here, man.

04:49.356 --> 04:50.623
Them white people
up in Vermont?

04:50.758 --> 04:52.891
That's your family.
Learn how to cherish

04:52.893 --> 04:54.893
every moment
you spend with them, okay?

04:54.895 --> 04:58.563
Because at the end of the day,
they all we got.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.365
- I appreciate that, Tray.
- And dig this here.

05:00.501 --> 05:03.769
If things don't work out,
I love my moms,

05:03.904 --> 05:05.905
but if you wanna do
some parent swapping,

05:06.040 --> 05:08.373
my moms could be over here
in a hot second.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.975
- Parent swapping?
- Yeah, man,

05:09.977 --> 05:11.510
I want an opportunity
to get in that swimming pool.

05:11.646 --> 05:12.311
- Uh-oh.

05:12.447 --> 05:15.180

05:15.182 --> 05:17.116
- Hey, I just, um,

05:17.118 --> 05:19.718
wanted to apologize
for Demar the other day.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.053
He's just under a lot
of pressure

05:21.188 --> 05:22.988
with the baby on the way.
- Felicia, no worries.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.858
I was just like him
when I was his age. All right?

05:25.993 --> 05:29.194
- This looks delicious.
- The secret to my casserole?

05:29.196 --> 05:31.396
I take food that most people
would throw away,

05:31.532 --> 05:32.865
and I make something
really good.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.067
See this tomato right here?
This was on its way out.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.070
Now it's the dominating
flavor in the dish.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.538
Giving food a second chance,

05:39.674 --> 05:41.340
making something out
of nothing,

05:41.476 --> 05:44.477
that's my specialty, girl.
You know, it's the key to life.

05:44.611 --> 05:46.879
That what I do,
and you and Demar will too.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.547
- Where did you get
all this wisdom?

05:48.549 --> 05:50.349
- Kim Kau's Kitchen
on Myrtle Ave.

05:50.485 --> 05:51.684
The fortune cookies,
you know that.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.286

- Hey, everybody, look.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.022
Baby daddy early today.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.491
- Baby, we gotta get out
of here now.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.025
- Demar, quit playing.

06:00.161 --> 06:01.760
- Demar, we are in the middle
of a class.

06:01.896 --> 06:04.163
What's wrong, brother?
- Stay out of our business.

06:04.165 --> 06:05.631
Felicia, let's go now.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.766
- For what? Why?
- Th-th-the cops!

06:07.902 --> 06:09.634
Th-th-th-they're after me.
We gotta get out of here now!

06:09.636 --> 06:10.836
- Oh.
- Oh.

06:10.838 --> 06:11.570
- What the hell?

06:11.706 --> 06:13.706
- Guess he's not proposing.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.979
- Once the kids clear, we'll
figure this situation out.

06:20.114 --> 06:22.314
For every problem,
there's a solution.

06:22.450 --> 06:25.317
- Where is everybody going?

06:25.453 --> 06:28.921
- Tray, look what we did.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.990
Now tell me,
which one is the best?

06:31.125 --> 06:33.926
And be honest, but remember
you live with me.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.861
[laughs]
- Veesy, Veesy, Veesy.

06:35.997 --> 06:37.529
- Yeah?
- We're gonna let you decide.

06:37.531 --> 06:38.931
- No, no, no, no.
I'm not getting caught

06:39.066 --> 06:40.666
in the middle of that.
Tray, you wanna tell me

06:40.802 --> 06:42.802
why the kids left a hour early
before class ended?

06:42.937 --> 06:45.004
- Apparently, we're on the run
from the cops.

06:45.139 --> 06:47.273
- What? Why are the cops
looking for them, Tray?

06:47.408 --> 06:49.408
- Technically, they're looking
for him,

06:49.543 --> 06:50.610
'cause I didn't do nothing.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.077
- We're trying to figure
this out now.

06:52.213 --> 06:54.546
Demar.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.215
- I got a warrant
for a gun charge.

06:56.350 --> 06:57.949
- No.
- A gun?

06:57.951 --> 06:59.685
Why do you need a gun
in the first place?

06:59.687 --> 07:01.153
- I got it after those dudes
jumped me.

07:01.155 --> 07:02.954
I needed something
to protect us, babe.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.956
- Did you file a police report
after you got jumped?

07:04.958 --> 07:06.958
- Miss Miller, a police report?

07:06.960 --> 07:08.427
- My ex-husband
was on the force,

07:08.562 --> 07:09.761
and believe it or not,

07:09.897 --> 07:11.897
we got allies
in the department.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.699
- Well, can you please give me
a direct line

07:13.701 --> 07:15.367
to the Ally Police?
'Cause all the cops

07:15.503 --> 07:17.903
I run in front of, they're from
the Beat-Your-Ass-Now,

07:17.905 --> 07:19.371
Ask-Questions-Later force.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.106
- See, it's a shame
that our people

07:21.242 --> 07:24.043
feel this way about police.
- Man, fuck the cops!

07:24.178 --> 07:25.645
They was standing there
when I got jumped,

07:25.779 --> 07:27.112
and they didn't do
a damn thing about it.

07:27.248 --> 07:29.181
They just watched me,
and now they wanna

07:29.317 --> 07:31.183
try to arrest me
for trying to protect myself.

07:31.185 --> 07:34.854
- Demar, you can't run, man.
It'll just make things worse.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.589
- I can't believe
you didn't tell me.

07:37.725 --> 07:38.991
- I-I-I wanted to,

07:38.993 --> 07:40.860
but I-I didn't want
to upset you.

07:40.995 --> 07:42.061
Look, we just got
our first sonogram--

07:42.196 --> 07:44.063
- Aw.
- What're you "aw-ing" for?

07:44.198 --> 07:45.397
- It's sweet.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.733
- Now I'm 34 weeks pregnant.

07:47.869 --> 07:49.535
- I know.
- So what are we gonna do?

07:49.671 --> 07:51.070
- 30--34 weeks?

07:51.205 --> 07:53.005
- It's eight months.
- Oh, oh, eight months!

07:53.007 --> 07:55.807
Oh, that album about to drop!
She about to--

07:55.943 --> 07:57.409
[clicks tongue, laughs]

07:57.545 --> 08:01.080
- You're wrong about that,
'cause Tray took 40 weeks.

08:01.215 --> 08:02.748
- 40?
- And my son came early too.

08:02.884 --> 08:04.684
So--so he got a point.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.085
- I'm sorry.
Can everybody

08:06.220 --> 08:07.887
please just stop talking
about how pregnant I am?

08:08.022 --> 08:10.356
- Yes, honey, I'm sorry.
- You coming with me or no?

08:10.491 --> 08:11.957
- You can't run.
That is not smart.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.226
You gotta be smart
about this, man, okay?

08:14.228 --> 08:16.696
You're young blood, man.
You hear me?

08:16.830 --> 08:18.964
You don't wanna do nothing
that you gonna regret

08:18.966 --> 08:21.166

for a second?

08:25.172 --> 08:29.108
Look, I get it. Right?
I hear you.

08:29.243 --> 08:31.911
But at the end of the day,
that's their business.

08:32.046 --> 08:34.046
That is their family.
That's their kid.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.048
- Veesy, I gotta make
this boy understand.

08:36.050 --> 08:39.118
I gotta help this kid. I gotta
help him do the right thing.

"let's hang out" tight?

Or "I'm on the run and I need
a place to hide" tight?

11:08.202 --> 11:09.601

that out when we get there.

we gotta get out of here.

something out of nothing

for me,

were just trying to avoid us.

it--it's hard for me.

I talk to you,

16:57.518 --> 16:58.584

bring up my past.

you had scared us.

You're doing it right now.

- Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Well, let's try this, okay?

that Shay and the kids

17:09.530 --> 17:11.397

I'm saying. It was all bad.
