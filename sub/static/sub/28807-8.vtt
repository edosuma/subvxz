What exactly happened with you and Sabine?

20:10.459 --> 20:15.756
So, when I first got to Portland, I...
kinda got wrapped up in her for a bit.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.216
You know...

20:17.674 --> 20:20.969
-She has this way about her.
-Oh yeah, I noticed.

20:21.053 --> 20:24.306
Yeah, but Sabine never wants to be
with anyone for too long or...

20:24.681 --> 20:26.266
stay anywhere for too long.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.060
It's that rock-n-roll lifestyle.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.436
Exactly.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.438
So, was it serious?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.873
Yeah, it was serious for a little.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.627
But I think what Sabine wants more
than a relationship is an audience.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.089
-Sounds intense.
-Yeah.

20:57.172 --> 20:58.757
Everything with her was always...

And after a while,
I just couldn't play by her rules.

If you guys were over,
then why'd she get so angry at the party?

21:10.644 --> 21:11.728
I don't know.
