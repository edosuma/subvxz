WEBVTT

00:05.572 --> 00:07.006
<i>Urca de Lima,</i>

00:07.074 --> 00:10.009
the largest Spanish treasure galleon
in the Americas.

00:10.077 --> 00:13.212
A page was torn from the log
with the Urca's course and schedule.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.081
Take them into custody.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.154
The schedule is here
on the island.

00:22.222 --> 00:24.757
The thief who stole it
has offered to sell it to me.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.826
5,000 pesos in pearls.

00:26.894 --> 00:29.528
- After I get payment, we leave tonight.
- Leave with me.

00:29.596 --> 00:32.298
I've spent my life trying
to build something here.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.567
If you ever challenge me
again in front of my crew,

00:34.635 --> 00:36.302
I might just forget
that I loved you once.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.070
The page is gone.
Don't lie to me!

00:41.541 --> 00:43.409
- Where's the page?
- You're looking at it.

00:43.477 --> 00:46.612
I took drastic measures.
Your schedule is up here.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.583
Ah!

03:28.742 --> 03:30.843
You're dripping blood
across my floor.

03:36.483 --> 03:40.486
Whoever tied this bandage
was either blind or drunk.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.854
I think both.

03:44.991 --> 03:46.892
Oh, my God.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.333
You couldn't have told me
about this last night?

03:57.037 --> 03:58.838
It's really not
as bad as it looks.

04:03.009 --> 04:04.543
Is that really necessary?

04:07.547 --> 04:09.148
One of my neighbors

04:09.216 --> 04:12.318
must have witnessed
your arrival last night.

04:12.385 --> 04:15.688
They've planted a spy
out by the scrub pine.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.890
The crone with the crooked nose?

04:19.091 --> 04:20.926
She passed.

04:20.994 --> 04:24.530
Pastor Lambrick has a new
chief of intelligencers.

04:24.598 --> 04:28.334
Mrs. Archer.
Eyes like saucers.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.176
What is it?

04:39.479 --> 04:41.013
I found it, Miranda.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.818
Parrish's ship?

04:48.421 --> 04:50.356
You found the schedule?

05:05.338 --> 05:06.539
Ma'am.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.913
She's gone.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.681
She's gone?
Are you sure?

05:17.317 --> 05:20.119
One of the whores
helped her past the guards.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.021
She said Max had a boat waiting.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.523
I went to check.
It's no longer there.

05:26.693 --> 05:29.295
I told her I would protect her.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.531
Did she not believe me?

05:35.068 --> 05:37.336
She chose this, not me.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.715
- Something wrong?
- You better be worth it.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.329
When do you imagine you'll sail?

06:03.396 --> 06:05.231
We'll know for certain
once that thief

06:05.298 --> 06:07.132
has transcribed
the page that he stole,

06:07.200 --> 06:09.668
but it'll be soon.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.272
Which reminds me.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.109
Found it in Parrish's cabin.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.880
Middleton.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.983
Thought you might like it.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.959
I must admit,

06:34.027 --> 06:36.495
given how long
it's taken to track him,

06:36.563 --> 06:38.697
I had wondered
if it was a lost cause.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.303
You seem disappointed.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.441
Not at all.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.310
I just...

06:54.814 --> 06:58.484
well, I was hoping
to have you all to myself.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.991
About that.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.331
Ma'am.

07:29.683 --> 07:30.849
I need a favor.

07:36.356 --> 07:37.790
You promised us a score.

07:37.857 --> 07:40.092
That I did.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.660
And now there's no score.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.996
There would not
appear to be, no.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.432
This ain't no joke, Jack.

07:46.499 --> 07:49.568
5,000 pesos of our money is gone

07:49.636 --> 07:51.236
and someone's got
to answer for it.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.238
I assure you all
what happened last night

07:53.306 --> 07:55.040
was as disappointing to me
as it was to you.

07:55.108 --> 07:58.610
But if you're quite certain
my value to this crew is exhausted,

07:58.678 --> 08:01.447
then by all means elect
yourselves a new quartermaster.

08:01.514 --> 08:03.949
Make it right, Jack.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.253
Quickly.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.698
- Where's the rest?
- Beg pardon?

08:52.766 --> 08:55.167
The Urca has a planned
stop to take on water

08:55.235 --> 08:56.869
<i>somewhere on the coast</i>
<i>of Florida.</i>

08:56.936 --> 09:00.439
That's the point where
they're most vulnerable to attack.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.441
This describes a course

09:02.509 --> 09:04.309
that ends miles
short of the coast.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.947
Where's the rest of the course?

09:10.450 --> 09:13.752
Well, I can't exactly
write that down, can I?

09:13.820 --> 09:14.887
Why not?

09:14.954 --> 09:17.389
Well, you all seem
rather angry with me.

09:17.457 --> 09:20.392
Especially you.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.594
And if I were
to write it all down,

09:22.662 --> 09:24.662
then what's to stop you
from killing me right here?

09:28.568 --> 09:29.935
I say we bring Joji in here.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.970
<i>He'll have it out of him</i>
<i>in 10 minutes.</i>

09:32.038 --> 09:34.640
<i>- Torture won't help you.</i>
<i>- You haven't seen Joji work.</i>

09:34.707 --> 09:38.110
No, I mean I have an
exceptionally low tolerance for pain.

09:38.178 --> 09:41.680
I'd say anything
to make it stop.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.715
But there may be a more

09:43.783 --> 09:47.453
mutually beneficial
solution to all this.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.722
What if I were to remain
with your crew?

09:53.860 --> 09:56.829
It makes sense.
I forgo payment for the schedule

09:56.896 --> 09:59.398
in exchange for my share
of the prize.

09:59.466 --> 10:01.033
You proceed with your plan.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.469
When the time comes for me
to reveal the last piece,

10:03.536 --> 10:06.271
I will be right by your side.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.740
If what I tell you
is in any way incorrect,

10:08.808 --> 10:10.742
well, you can do with me
what you will.

10:12.812 --> 10:15.581
And when the Urca's ours,

10:15.648 --> 10:18.016
what's to stop me
from killing you anyway?

10:19.519 --> 10:23.088
Well, that's a few weeks
from now, isn't it?

10:23.156 --> 10:25.023
We might be friends by then.

10:34.934 --> 10:37.169
Good enough for you?

10:40.306 --> 10:41.874
I guess it will have to be.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.611
Wait, we're moving ahead?

10:45.678 --> 10:48.280
<i>Mr. Gates and I will begin</i>
<i>our search for a consort.</i>

10:48.348 --> 10:50.115
This is not a task
we'll be able to complete

10:50.183 --> 10:52.551
without the assistance
of another ship.

10:52.619 --> 10:55.254
- Captain, can we just discuss this?
- Join me outside, Billy.

11:09.402 --> 11:12.271
We'll need some additional items
that will exceed our normal demands.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.840
- You'll have it.
- <i>100 casks of powder.</i>

11:14.908 --> 11:17.376
1,000 rounds of shot.

11:17.443 --> 11:21.647
New guns, 12-pounders.
At least a dozen of them.

11:24.651 --> 11:27.619
When we fire on the Urca, we'll need
to do more than make a scratch

11:27.687 --> 11:29.354
or we'll have no chance
of success.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.125
As I said...

11:36.563 --> 11:38.096
you'll have it.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.376
All right, fire away.

11:51.444 --> 11:54.413
Silver knows Singleton
wasn't a thief.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.960
Am I the only one
that remembers this?

11:55.982 --> 11:57.616
No, you're not.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.386
Our crew is less than a day removed
from a mutiny.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.655
I don't care how much gold
you dangle in front of them,

12:03.723 --> 12:05.624
that hatred
doesn't just disappear.

12:06.926 --> 12:09.261
And Flint wants to put
him back on board?

12:09.329 --> 12:12.731
What if he tells
the wrong person the truth?

12:12.799 --> 12:14.866
- I think we need to canvass.
- Oh, Billy.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.935
No, 'cause then we'll at least know
who to watch out for

12:17.003 --> 12:18.804
and who to keep Silver
separated from on the watch.

12:18.871 --> 12:20.772
And there's a good chance
by doing that,

12:20.840 --> 12:23.108
you're gonna cause the very same
suspicion you're looking to ferret out.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.978
You know that, don't you?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.284
Everything all right?

12:32.352 --> 12:33.719
Aye. Onward.

12:37.056 --> 12:38.924
You, come with me.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.660
You heard him.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.568
You sure he's all right?

12:49.636 --> 12:51.570
Billy?
He'll be fine.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.649
Randall.

13:03.716 --> 13:07.386
Mr. Silver here
has lost a wager to me.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.288
Owes me the rest of the day
helping you peel.

13:10.356 --> 13:13.291
Not supposed to wager
on the ship.

13:13.359 --> 13:17.496
I know, but it was made
over an ale at Guthrie's.

13:17.563 --> 13:19.297
It's all in good order.

13:19.365 --> 13:21.206
Would you do me a favor
and keep an eye on him?

13:23.169 --> 13:24.770
Give me a yell
if he tries to wander off.

13:29.175 --> 13:30.575
Peel.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.228
That's what I'll do
if he should wander.

13:57.303 --> 14:01.006
I haven't seen a pair of 12-pound guns
on this island in months.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.942
He wants a dozen and you
tell him not to worry.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.144
Bryson's due back in two days.

14:06.212 --> 14:08.046
And?

14:08.114 --> 14:10.782
He's armed himself with 12-pounders
since he joined my father's fleet.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.284
What?

14:12.351 --> 14:14.219
But they are his guns.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.521
You can't expect him
to give them to us.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.891
I understand that.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.730
And while we're on
the subject of Bryson,

14:24.797 --> 14:26.898
once he arrives, if he arrives,

14:26.966 --> 14:30.368
that is the last of your father's
supply ships we can expect.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.804
We have to assume
that the others

14:32.872 --> 14:34.439
will hear of your father's
arrest at port.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.742
In which case they won't
dare return here.

14:39.178 --> 14:40.545
Look.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.883
I can reach out to our
contacts in Port Harbour.

14:46.919 --> 14:49.588
And there's also the sloop trade
in Havana and Santo Domingo.

14:49.655 --> 14:52.724
But even so, we will only cover roughly
one-third of our costs

14:52.792 --> 14:56.394
per ship per week, which means
in less than four weeks...

14:56.462 --> 14:58.396
The warehouse is empty.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.935
Then he'll have to help us.

15:04.003 --> 15:06.138
Who?

15:06.205 --> 15:07.939
My father.

15:12.612 --> 15:16.214
I can't help but notice that
you don't seem to like me very much.

15:16.282 --> 15:17.849
Do you mind if I ask why?

15:19.719 --> 15:21.553
I can cook.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.655
I see.

15:23.723 --> 15:26.324
You're upset because
they gave me your job.

15:28.227 --> 15:29.928
In my own defense,

15:29.996 --> 15:33.365
I'm still trying to figure out how this
whole place works myself.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.835
I mean, I came aboard
the ship two days ago

15:36.903 --> 15:40.505
and I hear Mr. Singleton
making what sounds to me

15:40.573 --> 15:42.307
to be a lot of sense.

15:42.375 --> 15:45.811
Then less than a day later,
he's dead, Flint remains,

15:45.878 --> 15:49.247
and everyone seems to have
forgotten that any of it ever happened.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.656
What?

15:57.723 --> 16:00.559
Do you know of people
who still harbor

16:00.626 --> 16:03.328
some anger towards the captain?

16:03.396 --> 16:06.431
Not supposed to talk about that.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.466
Well, that's a shame.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.735
If you knew someone like that,

16:10.803 --> 16:13.738
I'd be very curious
as to what they had to say.

16:27.119 --> 16:28.486
Hello, Father.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.227
You lost a lot of blood.

16:35.294 --> 16:37.062
May I have a towel?

16:46.439 --> 16:48.240
I'm sorry this happened to you.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.280
Flint wants you guarded.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.282
To make certain you don't
interfere with his plan

16:57.350 --> 16:59.317
to hunt the Spanish galleon.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.056
Father, I need your help.

17:05.124 --> 17:07.791
If we're to stay in business here,
we need a new partner.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.527
Someone with ships
and legitimacy.

17:09.595 --> 17:12.631
Someone we can trust
not to cross you.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.666
I know this is difficult,
but I need you to trust me.

17:17.336 --> 17:18.703
I can do this.

17:35.087 --> 17:37.188
Who the fuck are you kidding?

17:37.256 --> 17:39.925
It's help me or flee to Boston.

17:39.992 --> 17:42.594
Beg your father
and brothers for sanctuary.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.130
Oh, they might save you
from the gallows,

17:45.197 --> 17:46.865
but they won't
spare you their scorn.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.867
You'll be right back
in the parlor room

17:48.935 --> 17:51.703
listening through a crack in the door
to where the real business is being done.

17:51.771 --> 17:55.707
Back to where you started before
you brought Mother and myself here

17:55.775 --> 17:59.344
and we made you into the man that
you always insisted to them that you were.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.246
Think on that while you
sit here and pretend

18:01.314 --> 18:03.155
that helping me isn't
the only choice you have.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.791
Billy, I don't know
what you want me to say.

18:12.858 --> 18:14.559
No griping?

18:14.627 --> 18:17.796
No grumbling over duties?

18:17.863 --> 18:20.532
Everyone on the crew
is content, that's what you're saying?

18:20.599 --> 18:22.500
Except for maybe this bastard.

18:24.236 --> 18:26.004
There you go.

18:30.042 --> 18:31.843
Hmm.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.914
Oh, for fuck's sakes.

18:37.783 --> 18:41.219
I just find it hard to believe.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.054
You know what I find
hard to believe?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.556
What?

18:44.623 --> 18:47.926
We've been on land two days

18:47.994 --> 18:50.628
and you still haven't
gotten yourself laid.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.931
Now that's a fucking mystery
worth investigating.

19:05.511 --> 19:06.678
I was right, wasn't I?

19:06.746 --> 19:09.114
Billy's been asking
'round about us.

19:09.181 --> 19:10.915
What do you think?
Does he know anything?

19:10.983 --> 19:12.917
No.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.820
And if we're smart,
it'll stay that way.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.924
What's this?
You backing out?

19:22.294 --> 19:25.063
You know Flint lied
about Singleton.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.965
You know what he is.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.874
Fuck you, then.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.088
I've been talking
with our friend Randall

19:50.156 --> 19:52.123
about my suspicions
about our captain.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.526
He seems to think
we might have that in common.

20:15.281 --> 20:18.149
You make me climb
those fucking stairs

20:18.217 --> 20:19.617
just to see you again

20:19.685 --> 20:22.587
and my first order of business will be
tossing you

20:22.655 --> 20:25.690
and that poxy chair
into the fucking ocean.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.928
Philip, do you know
the provenance

20:29.995 --> 20:31.563
of the chair in which
I currently sit?

20:31.630 --> 20:34.432
- The what?
- This chair once sat

20:34.500 --> 20:37.135
in the Plymouth office
of one Sir Francis Drake.

20:37.203 --> 20:41.172
I took this chair from a prize
off the coast of Boston.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.141
I lost six men in that fight.

20:43.209 --> 20:46.611
Ever since then,
this chair has resided here

20:46.679 --> 20:50.148
atop my fort from which
I survey the harbor

20:50.216 --> 20:53.651
that I protect for the good
of an ungrateful island.

20:53.719 --> 20:56.888
Philip, if Mr. Gates should
ever lay a hand on my chair,

20:56.956 --> 21:00.058
you have my permission
to shoot him where he stands.

21:00.126 --> 21:01.759
<i>Yes, sir, Captain Hornigold.</i>

21:09.735 --> 21:11.402
How are you, Ben?

21:12.671 --> 21:14.405
"How are you, Ben?"

21:14.473 --> 21:16.808
Don't be pleasant with me.
I know why you're here.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.710
L'Urca de Lima.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.257
Every captain
on the island is buzzing

21:20.279 --> 21:22.080
about who will be
joining you on consort.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.016
News travels fast.

21:26.485 --> 21:29.053
Time was the thought
of taking on a treasure galleon

21:29.121 --> 21:30.955
would have gotten you
laughed off a crew.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.358
The world's changed, Ben.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.393
Some risks nowadays,

21:35.461 --> 21:37.028
it's more dangerous
not to take 'em.

21:37.096 --> 21:40.798
Jesus, now you're
talking like him.

21:42.334 --> 21:45.036
So I am to be Flint's new consort, huh?
Is that what it is?

21:45.104 --> 21:47.205
He couldn't come down here
and ask me himself?

21:47.273 --> 21:49.174
He thinks you don't like him.

21:49.241 --> 21:51.910
Then he's right.
The man's arrogant and presumptuous.

21:51.977 --> 21:55.013
Be that as it may, he doesn't
want you as the consort.

21:56.182 --> 21:58.082
Then what does he want?

21:59.685 --> 22:02.987
Your ship and your crew.

22:03.055 --> 22:06.691
The offer is one share per man,
two for you personally

22:06.759 --> 22:08.459
<i>in exchange for your support</i>

22:08.527 --> 22:11.262
<i>in persuading the men</i>
<i>to vote in favor.</i>

22:11.330 --> 22:14.332
And who exactly is going
to captain my ship

22:14.400 --> 22:16.067
under these arrangements?

22:19.238 --> 22:21.806
Oh. You?!

22:21.874 --> 22:23.374
Oh, don't say it like that.

22:23.442 --> 22:25.643
- It's not such a crazy idea.
- Isn't it?

22:25.711 --> 22:27.879
Well, look, he doesn't want
somebody new.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.248
He and I share
a kind of a shorthand.

22:30.316 --> 22:31.950
Your ship is sound.

22:32.017 --> 22:35.086
Your crew know and trust me.
It makes the most sense.

22:37.756 --> 22:39.090
You assume too much.

22:39.158 --> 22:41.559
I'm not even certain my men
trust me at this stage.

22:45.413 --> 22:46.974
Any news from your friends
in Edinburgh?

22:46.999 --> 22:51.102
The last I heard,
James fled to France.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.871
Call him the Pretender now.

22:53.939 --> 22:56.975
I promised my men that if they
stayed with me, they'd be soldiers again,

22:57.042 --> 22:59.611
that they'd be part
of a rebel navy

22:59.678 --> 23:02.614
fighting a war to restore
a rightful king.

23:04.650 --> 23:05.917
Now...

23:05.985 --> 23:08.152
They'd never desert you.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.921
Who knows what they'll do?

23:09.989 --> 23:12.824
They're coming to terms with
a very uncomfortable truth.

23:14.126 --> 23:16.928
And what is that?

23:16.996 --> 23:19.664
That no matter how many lies
we tell ourselves

23:19.732 --> 23:22.634
or no matter how many stories
we convince ourselves

23:22.701 --> 23:24.569
<i>we're part of,</i>

23:24.637 --> 23:27.872
we're all just thieves
awaiting a noose.

23:39.385 --> 23:41.219
And what do I tell Flint?

23:44.823 --> 23:47.325
That after 50 years at sea...

23:48.894 --> 23:50.495
you're the only man
I've ever met

23:50.562 --> 23:52.664
that's gotten dumber with age.

24:07.646 --> 24:09.547
<i>Hello.</i>

24:13.452 --> 24:15.887
Salted meat, cornbread, broth.

24:17.690 --> 24:20.058
If you require
anything else, just ask.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.225
Who are you?

24:26.799 --> 24:28.499
My name is Mrs. Barlow.

24:28.567 --> 24:32.270
Who are you to him?

24:43.015 --> 24:44.782
"Marcus Aurelius."

24:44.850 --> 24:47.352
Have you read it?

24:47.419 --> 24:49.887
It's a personal favorite.

24:49.955 --> 24:52.790
And at the risk
of sounding presumptuous,

24:52.858 --> 24:55.159
I think you might
find it helpful.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.133
Perhaps when you've finished,

25:02.201 --> 25:04.168
we could discuss it together.

25:12.244 --> 25:13.644
Hey!

25:27.092 --> 25:29.052
What the hell are you doing here?
Where's Randall?

25:30.529 --> 25:31.796
Follow me.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.943
There.
The short-haired gentleman

25:46.011 --> 25:47.879
<i>who goes by Mr. Turk,</i>

25:47.946 --> 25:50.481
<i>Randall, and the man in black.</i>

25:53.085 --> 25:55.486
They are what's left
of your mutiny.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.356
How do you know?

25:58.424 --> 26:00.792
Because I had a long
conversation with Mr. Turk

26:00.859 --> 26:02.293
<i>about it this afternoon.</i>

26:02.361 --> 26:06.130
His resentment of the captain
runs very, very deep.

26:06.198 --> 26:08.900
And he's convinced
Flint lied about Singleton.

26:08.967 --> 26:11.035
When I told him
I was of a like mind,

26:11.103 --> 26:13.304
he happily opened up.

26:14.473 --> 26:16.474
And now you're telling me why?

26:16.542 --> 26:18.576
I want to live.

26:18.644 --> 26:21.446
Earning your trust seemed
like a good start toward that end.

26:21.513 --> 26:24.649
Now, would you like
to know what Mr. Turk

26:24.716 --> 26:27.385
shared with me
about our beloved captain?

26:29.021 --> 26:30.955
Turk thinks Flint is undead,

26:31.023 --> 26:32.990
walks the earth without a soul.

26:33.058 --> 26:35.927
He believes there's a witch
who lives deep inside the island

26:35.994 --> 26:38.463
<i>who controls his every move.</i>

26:38.530 --> 26:41.632
More or less, yes.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.802
Fucking numbskull's been
spreading those tales for years.

26:44.870 --> 26:47.872
Randall is Randall.

26:49.308 --> 26:50.675
But Morley...

26:52.845 --> 26:54.445
Morley I had no idea about.

26:56.248 --> 26:59.517
He's got no one left
but the misfits.

26:59.585 --> 27:00.952
How dangerous can he be?

27:10.829 --> 27:13.931
Mind if I sit down?

27:13.999 --> 27:16.267
I understand congratulations
are in order.

27:16.335 --> 27:19.203
Captaining the Royal Lion
as consort to the Walrus.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.105
It's your first command,
is it not?

27:22.975 --> 27:25.910
Get up and walk away.

27:27.246 --> 27:28.846
With all due respect,
Mr. Gates,

27:28.914 --> 27:30.548
this tone is beneath us.

27:30.616 --> 27:32.850
As quartermasters,
we serve our men best

27:32.918 --> 27:35.219
when we rise above the fray
and see the truth

27:35.287 --> 27:36.587
from an unobstructed vantage.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.822
When we indulge in their...

27:37.890 --> 27:40.925
I don't know what
you're after, Jack,

27:40.993 --> 27:44.996
but you sound like one
desperate motherfucker to me.

27:45.063 --> 27:48.466
Has this got anything to do
with that massive stash

27:48.534 --> 27:52.370
of pearls you lost
out by the wrecks, eh?

27:53.939 --> 27:56.908
How long did they give you
to make it right?

27:56.975 --> 27:58.876
They weren't specific
about time frames.

27:58.944 --> 28:03.414
Oh, usually in my experience,
that means about three days.

28:03.482 --> 28:06.050
Perhaps instead of pestering me,

28:06.118 --> 28:09.387
you should be out there
looking for a boat.

28:14.192 --> 28:17.495
It won't take much for you
to lose that new crew of yours.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.667
You may have them
fooled now, but at sea...

28:22.734 --> 28:26.203
<i>Perhaps you'll oversleep the bells</i>
<i>and need to be roused.</i>

28:26.271 --> 28:29.440
Perhaps you'll be handed the glass
and need help with where to point it.

28:29.508 --> 28:32.977
Perhaps you'll slip and fall and
that knee of yours will finally give out.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.581
Perhaps... perhaps.

28:36.648 --> 28:39.350
Perhaps no one
will say anything.

28:39.418 --> 28:41.419
<i>Of course, they respect</i>
<i>you too much for that.</i>

28:41.486 --> 28:43.955
<i>But the moment</i>
<i>the Urca looms close</i>

28:44.022 --> 28:45.690
<i>and the first shot</i>
<i>is fired in anger,</i>

28:45.757 --> 28:50.194
you know exactly what every last man
in that crew will be thinking.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.463
Christ Almighty,
I wish we had a captain

28:52.531 --> 28:54.632
30 years younger.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.714
What did we spend on stores?

29:09.781 --> 29:11.816
Too much, sir.
We're bleeding money.

29:11.883 --> 29:14.318
Just tell me how much it was.

29:14.386 --> 29:16.754
- 105...
- Mr. Dufresne.

29:16.822 --> 29:18.589
Would you give us
a moment, please?

29:18.657 --> 29:20.491
We're almost done.
Just another minute.

29:20.559 --> 29:23.427
Dufresne, get the fuck out.

29:31.670 --> 29:34.739
I think I have a better idea for
the consort than the one we discussed.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.310
Another crew for you to captain?

29:39.378 --> 29:42.480
No, different captain.
Comes with his own crew.

29:42.547 --> 29:45.049
Really?
Who?

29:47.252 --> 29:48.786
Charles Vane.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.762
Yeah.
Yes, let's do that.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.703
That wasn't a joke, was it?

30:08.206 --> 30:10.007
- Are you ill?
- Not that I'm aware of.

30:10.075 --> 30:11.842
Then why would you even think...

30:11.910 --> 30:14.845
Because the Ranger
is twice the ship the Lion is.

30:14.913 --> 30:18.082
More men, more guns.

30:18.150 --> 30:21.118
More importantly,
the captain is strong in a fight,

30:21.186 --> 30:23.087
second only to you.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.660
Where's this coming from?

30:32.130 --> 30:34.565
You said it yourself.

30:34.633 --> 30:36.534
Without the Urca,
we have nothing.

30:38.336 --> 30:41.405
From where I'm sitting,
without Vane,

30:41.473 --> 30:43.340
we don't have the Urca.

30:51.750 --> 30:54.819
Even if I was willing
to consider this,

30:54.886 --> 30:58.322
and I am absolutely not
willing to consider this,

30:58.390 --> 31:00.858
what makes you even think
he would do it?

31:03.295 --> 31:05.896
- Fuck you, Jack.
<i>I understand your feelings,</i>

31:05.964 --> 31:09.467
but humbly, I'm not certain
this is entirely your choice.

31:13.338 --> 31:15.673
You already told the crew.

31:15.683 --> 31:17.050
They have a right to know.

31:17.056 --> 31:19.591
And if Mr. Gates succeeds in bringing
Flint to the table,

31:19.658 --> 31:22.138
they may wish to move forward
with or without your endorsement.

31:22.161 --> 31:24.262
They were ready
to bury you this morning.

31:24.330 --> 31:26.231
You're looking to dig
the hole even deeper.

31:26.298 --> 31:29.234
They need to yell
every now and then.

31:29.301 --> 31:31.236
It's good
for their self-esteem.

31:31.303 --> 31:34.205
And besides, you haven't even asked me
what's in it for you.

31:35.641 --> 31:38.176
You said five million
pieces of eight.

31:38.244 --> 31:39.677
That's what's in it
for the crew.

31:39.745 --> 31:40.979
Do you really think
I'd bring you something

31:41.046 --> 31:42.806
like this with just money
to offer in return?

31:42.815 --> 31:45.717
<i>See the bigger picture.</i>

31:45.784 --> 31:47.118
What are you talking about?

31:47.186 --> 31:50.521
If we swallow our pride
and help Flint land the Urca,

31:50.589 --> 31:52.957
who else on this island
stands to benefit?

31:58.130 --> 32:00.732
Who else might see you
in a different light?

32:19.455 --> 32:22.096
What did you have to threaten him
with to get him to agree to this?

32:22.121 --> 32:24.822
This was his idea.

32:32.598 --> 32:34.332
Here we go.

32:47.713 --> 32:49.914
Shall we begin?

32:49.982 --> 32:51.949
First off, let me
express my appreciation

32:52.017 --> 32:54.018
to everyone seated
at this table.

32:54.086 --> 32:56.220
Given recent events,
it's encouraging to know

32:56.288 --> 32:59.457
that we can still rise above our
differences in the spirit of mutual...

32:59.525 --> 33:01.426
I want to talk about Mosiah.

33:03.729 --> 33:05.196
...gain.

33:05.264 --> 33:06.631
What about him?

33:08.567 --> 33:10.101
He's dead.

33:11.236 --> 33:13.871
And before we rise
above anything,

33:13.939 --> 33:17.008
I want to hear your cowardly
fuck of a captain

33:17.076 --> 33:18.743
<i>apologize for it.</i>

33:24.016 --> 33:27.151
I'd like a moment to confer
with my colleague.

33:29.555 --> 33:30.955
Outside.

33:39.631 --> 33:41.799
That was my fault.
Entirely my fault.

33:41.867 --> 33:44.235
I should have been clearer
when I prepared you for this meeting.

33:44.303 --> 33:46.571
When I said we would need
to keep our tempers in check

33:46.638 --> 33:48.272
if we were going to make
this meeting happen,

33:48.340 --> 33:50.108
I should have specified
we'd need to do so

33:50.175 --> 33:52.610
for the duration
of the meeting as well.

33:52.678 --> 33:54.345
Not to worry.
A simple setback.

33:54.413 --> 33:56.481
Now we have clarity
and a unity of vision.

33:56.548 --> 33:58.483
I feel good.
You?

34:04.289 --> 34:07.191
All righty, then.

34:16.935 --> 34:18.603
What Captain Flint meant to say

34:18.670 --> 34:21.205
<i>is that we have a crew</i>
<i>to answer to.</i>

34:21.273 --> 34:24.242
<i>And whether we can reach an agreement
around this table is meaningless</i>

34:24.309 --> 34:26.511
if we can't sell it to our men.

34:26.578 --> 34:28.946
Having lost a valued
and respected brother,

34:29.014 --> 34:31.748
they will want to know
what's been done about it.

34:34.620 --> 34:37.088
Without accepting responsibility

34:37.156 --> 34:38.623
for your loss,

34:38.690 --> 34:41.692
I can see a small
allowance being made

34:41.760 --> 34:43.293
for goodwill.

34:45.898 --> 34:47.398
How much did you have in mind?

34:47.466 --> 34:49.699
£10,000.

34:52.504 --> 34:54.272
<i>That's for Mosiah.</i>

34:54.339 --> 34:57.241
Now let's talk about
his man that you killed.

35:01.947 --> 35:03.981
No, that's all right.
We can wait.

35:08.720 --> 35:11.122
Well, at this rate,
the Urca will get to Cadiz

35:11.190 --> 35:13.324
and back again before
we resolve anything.

35:16.528 --> 35:18.262
I'm gonna take a piss.

35:26.138 --> 35:27.839
Be honest.

35:29.241 --> 35:32.176
Are you as surprised as I am...

35:32.244 --> 35:34.946
that I'm the only one here
behaving myself?

35:46.792 --> 35:49.293
A share per man,
two for the captain,

35:49.361 --> 35:50.928
two additional
for use of the ship,

35:50.996 --> 35:53.865
and five set aside in a fund
to offset injury payments.

35:59.438 --> 36:00.838
Share and a half
for the captain,

36:00.906 --> 36:02.740
one for the ship.

36:02.808 --> 36:04.141
Injuries come out of your end.

36:05.844 --> 36:08.012
But your men get priority on...

36:08.080 --> 36:10.114
unique items.

36:10.182 --> 36:12.116
Ooh.

36:18.190 --> 36:20.691
Done.

36:20.759 --> 36:22.293
Oh, just one more thing.

36:22.361 --> 36:24.061
Don't push your luck, Jack.

36:24.129 --> 36:25.463
No, no, the terms are agreeable.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.231
My concern is
who will enforce them?

36:28.500 --> 36:30.167
What the fuck
are you talking about?

36:30.235 --> 36:33.971
Your role in propping up
Captain Flint was made clear

36:34.039 --> 36:36.140
when you assaulted my captain
the other night.

36:36.208 --> 36:38.075
What's to stop you from
altering the terms of the deal

36:38.143 --> 36:40.945
after the fact to see it suit
a more favored party?

36:41.013 --> 36:43.314
<i>I'd feel much better if our deal</i>

36:43.382 --> 36:46.017
had a more impartial guarantor.

36:46.084 --> 36:48.319
And who did you have in mind?

36:48.387 --> 36:50.121
The only person around here
that isn't beholden

36:50.188 --> 36:52.123
to Miss Guthrie
for their livelihood.

36:54.092 --> 36:56.928
- Her father.
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

36:56.995 --> 36:59.931
What have we been doing here all day
if you're planning on pulling this shit?

36:59.998 --> 37:02.567
Certainly he can be persuaded to come
down off the mountain,

37:02.634 --> 37:04.869
as it were, and bless
our little arrangement.

37:08.307 --> 37:10.007
Unless I'm missing something.

37:10.075 --> 37:12.476
My father doesn't know
about this.

37:14.179 --> 37:16.180
I see.

37:17.950 --> 37:20.017
But you have my word
these terms shall be honored.

37:21.687 --> 37:23.654
Perhaps it would be wise
to revisit our terms

37:23.722 --> 37:25.456
to account for this added risk.

37:25.524 --> 37:27.625
<i>- No one's revisiting shit.</i>
<i>- We had a fucking deal.</i>

37:27.693 --> 37:29.293
I've heard enough.

37:30.796 --> 37:32.763
<i>The terms are fine.</i>

37:36.668 --> 37:38.469
Her word's good enough for me.

37:41.673 --> 37:43.541
And it's good enough
for you, too.

37:47.846 --> 37:49.146
Well...

37:53.018 --> 37:56.253
can we consider this a deal?

38:09.868 --> 38:11.902
I was getting somewhere.

38:11.970 --> 38:15.272
You're too clever
for your own good, Jack.

38:15.340 --> 38:18.275
Regardless, our fortunes
appear to be on the rise.

38:21.980 --> 38:23.114
So...

38:25.050 --> 38:28.152
perhaps it's time you
finished cleaning up last night's mess

38:28.220 --> 38:30.354
before someone finds out

38:30.422 --> 38:33.658
and everything we've achieved here
goes up in smoke.

38:46.204 --> 38:48.305
She's all yours, Captain.

39:16.401 --> 39:18.369
You do understand

39:18.437 --> 39:20.404
I had no choice.

39:22.574 --> 39:25.409
What you did,

39:25.477 --> 39:27.278
it required an answer.

39:38.056 --> 39:40.024
<i>I've been meaning to ask you.</i>

39:41.293 --> 39:45.062
Our mutual friend,

39:45.130 --> 39:47.064
<i>she put guards at your door,</i>

39:47.132 --> 39:48.933
<i>tried to protect you.</i>

39:49.000 --> 39:52.369
Yet you left anyway.

39:53.505 --> 39:54.805
Why?

39:57.876 --> 39:59.677
You really have to ask?

40:02.948 --> 40:04.582
How did you feel

40:04.649 --> 40:07.718
when she threw you aside?

40:22.134 --> 40:24.902
When she's ready,
get her on a boat.

40:24.970 --> 40:28.506
Captain, this isn't
what I meant by cleaning up.

40:30.208 --> 40:31.909
<i>What if she comes back?</i>

40:35.113 --> 40:36.213
She won't.

40:41.019 --> 40:42.920
Do it after dark.

40:45.056 --> 40:47.224
And do it quietly.

41:12.117 --> 41:13.551
<i>Mrs. Barlow.</i>

41:15.387 --> 41:18.589
I'm sorry. You're expecting company.
I can return another time.

41:18.657 --> 41:21.392
Pastor Lambrick,
you have happened by here

41:21.459 --> 41:22.993
every Wednesday for months now.

41:23.061 --> 41:25.296
<i>I've grown tired</i>
<i>of acting surprised,</i>

41:25.363 --> 41:27.531
so I have instead
decided this Wednesday

41:27.599 --> 41:28.966
to receive you properly.

41:30.702 --> 41:33.037
I beg your pardon.
I'm afraid I've become a burden.

41:33.104 --> 41:35.573
Far from it.

41:35.640 --> 41:37.975
I look forward
to our conversations.

41:38.043 --> 41:39.710
Please, sit?

42:00.532 --> 42:02.299
This week's sermon?

42:03.602 --> 42:06.170
Your thoughts
are always enlightening.

42:09.708 --> 42:11.075
Ahem.

42:11.142 --> 42:14.778
Easter.
Is it Easter already?

42:25.257 --> 42:27.992
"It is Christ's love of sinners
that gave him the strength

42:28.059 --> 42:30.194
to endure his agony.

42:30.262 --> 42:32.529
This, the truest form of love,

42:32.597 --> 42:34.465
love through suffering..."

42:36.568 --> 42:38.168
Do you believe this?

42:38.236 --> 42:41.005
It's not to be believed
or disbelieved.

42:41.072 --> 42:43.374
It's God's gospel truth,
is it not?

42:48.880 --> 42:51.916
"Thy navel is like
a round goblet

42:51.983 --> 42:54.518
which wanteth not liquor.

42:54.586 --> 42:58.255
Thy belly is like
a heap of wheat

42:58.323 --> 43:00.391
set about with lilies.

43:01.526 --> 43:04.862
Thy breasts are like two fawns,

43:04.930 --> 43:08.032
twins of a gazelle.

43:08.099 --> 43:11.435
Thy stature is like
that of a palm tree

43:11.503 --> 43:14.905
and thy breasts like
clusters of grapes.

43:17.042 --> 43:19.677
I will go up the palm tree

43:19.744 --> 43:22.179
and take hold
of its fruits."

43:24.616 --> 43:26.550
God wrote that, too.

43:28.987 --> 43:31.622
True love shouldn't
require suffering.

43:31.690 --> 43:33.958
And you don't have
to take my word for it.

43:35.560 --> 43:37.227
More tea?

44:03.188 --> 44:06.523
I must confess there is
an ulterior motive for my visit today

44:06.591 --> 44:08.525
beyond the content of my sermon.

44:08.593 --> 44:10.828
Is that so?

44:10.895 --> 44:14.231
There are whispers
among my flock

44:14.299 --> 44:16.000
that a ship of the Royal Navy

44:16.067 --> 44:18.836
docked in Harbour Island
recently.

44:18.903 --> 44:21.171
The Scarborough.

44:21.239 --> 44:24.975
They say the king
means to reassert colonial rule here.

44:25.043 --> 44:27.344
Perhaps soon.

44:27.412 --> 44:30.881
Judgment in this world,
not the next.

44:30.949 --> 44:32.950
For those who are
a part of my flock

44:33.018 --> 44:34.918
when that judgment arrives,

44:34.986 --> 44:37.821
their righteousness
will almost certainly go beyond doubt.

44:39.190 --> 44:41.725
It's not quite
that simple for me.

44:43.128 --> 44:45.295
Is he keeping you here?

44:53.204 --> 44:55.072
<i>Good day, Pastor.</i>

46:03.374 --> 46:04.942
Ah!

46:37.809 --> 46:39.676
Hello, Jack.

46:41.579 --> 46:43.480
Gentlemen.

46:43.548 --> 46:45.849
The captain might
have brought her here...

46:47.819 --> 46:51.255
but it's up to us
when we're done with her.

47:36.734 --> 47:38.735
Captain, the men.
I need you now.

47:38.803 --> 47:40.170
Oh, shit.

47:42.740 --> 47:44.374
Eleanor, wait.

47:44.442 --> 47:45.909
- Fuck.
- Shit.

48:11.436 --> 48:13.303
Fuck you!

48:26.517 --> 48:27.784
You did this.

48:39.497 --> 48:41.231
Listen to me very carefully.

48:41.299 --> 48:45.402
You are, all of you,
this whole crew,

48:45.470 --> 48:47.638
as of right now finished!

48:47.705 --> 48:52.209
<i>You will not sell anything.</i>
<i>You will not buy anything.</i>

48:52.277 --> 48:54.011
You will not eat anything.

48:54.078 --> 48:56.146
Eleanor.

48:58.316 --> 49:01.018
Unless...

49:03.254 --> 49:06.089
unless you decide right now

49:06.157 --> 49:07.924
to elect yourselves
a new captain.

49:14.165 --> 49:17.768
Unless you decide to join
the crew of Captain Flint.

49:20.938 --> 49:24.508
You will join his crew and
you will grant him disposal of your ship.

49:26.878 --> 49:29.646
So what will it be?

49:29.714 --> 49:32.115
Beggars under an old captain?

49:34.252 --> 49:36.553
Or rich men under a new one?

49:45.330 --> 49:47.364
Where are you going?

50:15.226 --> 50:17.994
You move, you die.

50:27.038 --> 50:28.972
Get the fuck away from her!

50:33.411 --> 50:34.845
I'm so sorry.

50:34.912 --> 50:37.247
I'm so sorry he did this to you.

50:37.315 --> 50:38.915
Let me take care of you.

50:41.452 --> 50:42.819
We could have left.

50:44.555 --> 50:46.990
We could have been free.

50:48.526 --> 50:50.293
He didn't do this to me.

50:52.997 --> 50:54.364
You did.

51:08.212 --> 51:10.313
My actions cost you your pearls.

51:12.116 --> 51:14.885
Until the debt is paid,

51:14.952 --> 51:16.686
I am yours.

51:36.441 --> 51:38.241
What the hell just happened?

51:40.044 --> 51:42.446
It looks like she
just gave us a ship.

51:45.082 --> 51:47.017
A ship with no captain.

52:16.747 --> 52:19.115
Billy.

52:19.183 --> 52:21.051
Is my watch up?

52:27.358 --> 52:29.926
So, what now?

52:31.562 --> 52:32.996
You here to threaten me?

52:33.064 --> 52:35.432
What the captain wants
to accomplish here,

52:35.500 --> 52:38.301
our survival hangs
in the balance.

52:38.369 --> 52:41.071
And I need to know we're
all pulling in the same direction.

52:42.440 --> 52:45.175
I've got a right
to think what I think.

52:45.243 --> 52:46.476
Well, then say it.

52:49.113 --> 52:51.381
Singleton was no thief.

52:51.449 --> 52:55.151
He had his warts,
but thieving wasn't one of them.

52:55.219 --> 52:57.687
Singleton stole the page.

52:57.755 --> 52:59.756
Saw it with my own eyes.

53:03.094 --> 53:04.461
You calling me a liar?

53:08.299 --> 53:09.933
Oh, fuck!

53:17.308 --> 53:19.576
I may be wrong about Singleton,

53:19.644 --> 53:22.178
but I'm not wrong about Flint.

53:24.315 --> 53:25.982
What's that supposed to mean?

53:26.050 --> 53:28.752
To him, we're all disposable.

53:30.087 --> 53:33.056
Chits to be used
for his own purposes.

53:37.895 --> 53:39.362
I don't believe that.

53:42.066 --> 53:46.670
That's because you don't
know about Mrs. Barlow.

53:58.149 --> 53:59.883
You were right.

54:01.118 --> 54:03.687
This is a remarkable book.

54:14.899 --> 54:16.333
May I?

54:30.348 --> 54:33.883
The emperor writes,

54:33.951 --> 54:36.286
"How should you be?

54:36.354 --> 54:39.422
You should be like
a rocky promontory

54:39.490 --> 54:43.627
against which the restless
surf continually pounds.

54:44.829 --> 54:48.063
It stands fast
while the churning sea

54:48.064 --> 54:51.166
is lulled to sleep at its feet.

54:54.800 --> 54:57.234
<i>I hear you say, 'How unlucky</i>

54:57.302 --> 54:59.670
<i>that this should</i>
<i>happen to me.'</i>

55:04.509 --> 55:06.277
<i>But not at all.</i>

55:09.681 --> 55:12.249
<i>Perhaps say instead,</i>

55:12.317 --> 55:14.318
<i>'How lucky I am</i>

55:14.386 --> 55:18.789
<i>that I am not broken</i>
<i>by what has happened</i>

55:18.857 --> 55:22.593
<i>and I'm not afraid</i>
<i>of what is about to happen.'</i>

55:24.129 --> 55:27.832
<i>For the same blow</i>
<i>might have struck anyone,</i>

55:27.899 --> 55:31.235
but not many who would
have absorbed it

55:31.303 --> 55:34.305
without capitulation
or complaint."
