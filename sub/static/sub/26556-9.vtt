WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:03.133
My name is Oliver queen.

00:03.177 --> 00:05.353
After 6 months in hell,
I have been released from prison

00:05.396 --> 00:07.137
and returned home
with only one goal...

00:07.181 --> 00:10.184
To save my city,
but things have changed.

00:10.227 --> 00:11.663
Instead of operating
outside the law,

00:11.707 --> 00:14.014
I am now working
alongside the police.

00:14.057 --> 00:16.320
I am no longer inmate 4587.

00:16.364 --> 00:20.672
I am once more the green arrow.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.544
Previously on "flash"...

00:22.587 --> 00:24.154
Dr. John Deegan,

00:24.198 --> 00:26.678
use this book
to reshape the world

00:26.722 --> 00:28.506
as you see fit.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.207
I can see everything.

00:33.250 --> 00:34.860
Barry, are you ok?

00:34.904 --> 00:36.079
I'm Barry.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.040
I'm Oliver queen.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.998
Maybe it's just earth 1
that's been affected.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.869
If we can get
to earth 38 and find Kara,

00:43.913 --> 00:47.003
if she remembers us, then maybe she
can help fix whatever's happening.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.483
Whoa, Lois.
Wait, wait.

00:48.526 --> 00:50.789
This is Barry and Oliver.
They're friends.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.704
So you know that I'm
Oliver and he's Barry?

00:52.748 --> 00:54.619
- Why wouldn't I?
- We could use your help.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.839
I vibed somebody
in the speed lab,

00:56.882 --> 00:58.797
some guy with ridges
on his head.

00:58.841 --> 01:00.103
I know where to find him.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.974
So what's our next move?

01:02.018 --> 01:03.672
We're going to Gotham city.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.244
Ohh!

01:10.287 --> 01:13.464
Ok. I know this sounds nuts
and completely unscientific,

01:13.508 --> 01:15.423
but I think that freaking
lightning is following us.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.729
- Focus, Curtis.
- This is me focusing.

01:17.773 --> 01:19.383
These atmospheric anomalies
are playing all kinds

01:19.427 --> 01:21.081
of hell on my equipment,

01:21.124 --> 01:22.517
plus you don't want
that lightning to hit

01:22.560 --> 01:24.084
when you're engaging
deathstroke's son.

01:31.395 --> 01:32.744
I just had to say it.

01:32.788 --> 01:34.746
Kane wolfman,
you're under arrest

01:34.790 --> 01:36.748
for 19 violations
of international law!

01:36.792 --> 01:39.447
Really? Does that
include the murder of...

01:41.971 --> 01:44.016
4 a.R.G.U.S.
Field agents?

01:44.060 --> 01:45.627
Last chance!
On the ground now!

02:08.866 --> 02:11.827
This isn't personal.
Just business.

02:20.705 --> 02:22.098
Son of a bitch.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.708
Is that any way to
greet your friends?

02:23.752 --> 02:26.450
All I know is that whenever
the three of you show up,

02:26.494 --> 02:28.887
it usually means we have
one huge problem.

02:41.944 --> 02:44.990
So you're you.

02:45.034 --> 02:47.079
And you're you.

02:47.123 --> 02:50.648
An immortal Egyptian,
aliens, parallel earth Nazis.

02:50.692 --> 02:53.521
I have no idea why I'm even
surprised at this point.

02:53.564 --> 02:55.218
I'm still trying
to figure out if this is

02:55.262 --> 02:57.046
more like "freaky Friday"
or "quantum leap."

02:57.089 --> 02:58.656
No. If this were
like "quantum leap,"

02:58.700 --> 03:00.484
I'd only look like
myself in the mirror.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.443
Yep. You are definitely
not Oliver queen.

03:02.486 --> 03:03.966
We think that the red skies

03:04.009 --> 03:05.881
and these lightning strikes
have to be related

03:05.924 --> 03:07.709
to whatever happened to
Barry and Oliver somehow.

03:07.752 --> 03:10.494
We need you to solve the somehow
while we're in Gotham.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.540
No problem.
I mean, a.R.G.U.S. Has

03:12.583 --> 03:14.498
all the best analytic toys,

03:14.542 --> 03:15.891
but what we really need is a
pattern recognition algorithm,

03:15.934 --> 03:17.371
and, unfortunately,
Felicity isn't...

03:17.414 --> 03:19.155
- I called Felicity.
- Wait, wait.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.722
- You called Felicity?
- Yeah.

03:20.765 --> 03:22.419
Ok. Right. Well,
I guess that makes sense

03:22.463 --> 03:24.900
because technically,
you are her husband.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.380
I'm confused.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.469
I've been summoned?

03:30.297 --> 03:33.735
- Yes. Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.389
I mean, things might be
fraught between us, Oliver.

03:35.432 --> 03:36.912
That doesn't mean I'm
not gonna show up.

03:36.955 --> 03:39.044
They are? They are?

03:39.088 --> 03:45.442
They are. Yeah,
which is... sad.

03:47.401 --> 03:48.837
So, um, this lightning thing.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.665
Um, could you help
me out with that?

03:50.708 --> 03:52.797
Can I kind of show you kind
of what I'm thinking?

03:52.841 --> 03:54.625
- Yeah.
- Ok.

03:57.628 --> 04:00.675
Ok. So why didn't
you tell Felicity?

04:00.718 --> 04:02.720
Well, because we tried to tell
everybody at s.T.A.R. Labs,

04:02.764 --> 04:04.156
and it didn't really
go over so well.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.594
Felicity and I have
enough problems as it is

04:06.637 --> 04:08.204
without introducing
body swapping.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.337
We thought we'd just
let her think everything's

04:10.380 --> 04:12.252
normal and that Barry
and I are solving

04:12.295 --> 04:13.644
another problem.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.994
If you find out
how this lightning thing

04:16.038 --> 04:18.997
relates to whatever it is
that we're dealing with here,

04:19.041 --> 04:20.216
can you please tell us?

04:20.260 --> 04:21.783
Copy that.

04:21.826 --> 04:23.611
Hey. This thing isn't
gonna be permanent, is it?

04:23.654 --> 04:25.874
- I hope not.
- I hope not.

04:25.917 --> 04:27.615
Jinx.

04:29.225 --> 04:31.793
Oh. Barry, there's something I'd
like to discuss before we go.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.882
- What's that?
- That you probably shouldn't go.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.231
What?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.928
Oliver queen is a public figure

04:36.972 --> 04:38.321
and an infamous vigilante.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.844
If you are in Gotham city,
you're attracting

04:39.888 --> 04:41.498
the type of attention
that we don't want.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.195
No. If... if Gotham can
handle the Batman,

04:43.239 --> 04:44.762
it can handle the green arrow.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.460
The Batman's an urban legend.

04:46.503 --> 04:48.940
Wait. You don't believe
Batman's real?

04:48.984 --> 04:50.899
He's not real.
He's an urban legend

04:50.942 --> 04:52.466
concocted by the Gotham
police department

04:52.509 --> 04:53.815
to scare criminals.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.643
And I'm the original
vigilante, Barry.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.514
Ok, if you guys are done
fooling around...

04:57.558 --> 04:59.081
Actually, you know what? Could
you pull that thing up?

04:59.124 --> 05:00.648
Because, unlike you, my
identity's not public,

05:00.691 --> 05:02.345
and I'd like to keep
it that way.

05:02.389 --> 05:03.738
This isn't your real face!

05:03.781 --> 05:05.217
It might end up
being my real face

05:05.261 --> 05:07.132
if we don't sort this
mess out, so could you?

05:11.006 --> 05:12.921
- Happy?
- Ecstatic.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.966
Apparently, you guys
aren't done fooling around.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.535
Well, I guess I'm running alone.

05:27.588 --> 05:31.374
Ho ho ho!
That is so awesome.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.333
So this is Gotham.

05:33.376 --> 05:36.074
Doesn't look so tough to me.

05:36.118 --> 05:37.728
Where's Oliver?

05:37.772 --> 05:39.600
Huh. I don't know.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.778
Guess he's still getting
the hang of it.

05:43.821 --> 05:44.953
Yeah.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.520
Ha ha ha!

05:46.563 --> 05:48.130
I'm still getting
the hang of it.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.653
All right.
All right.

05:49.697 --> 05:51.307
So how do we find two people

05:51.351 --> 05:52.917
in a city
of 1.6 million?

05:52.961 --> 05:55.529
There is a radio personality
named vesper Fairchild.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.269
She knows everyone in Gotham,

05:57.313 --> 05:58.793
and I know her.

05:58.836 --> 06:00.447
She was doing an exposeÃ©
on white-collar crime

06:00.490 --> 06:02.536
back in the day,
and I wanted to persuade her

06:02.579 --> 06:04.451
that queen consolidated
was above board.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.235
So you slept with her, right?

06:06.278 --> 06:09.281
No. I... I don't know.

06:09.325 --> 06:12.197
Gosh. You really got around
back in the day, didn't you?

06:12.241 --> 06:14.417
Oh. One time, Oliver
cheated on his girlfriend

06:14.461 --> 06:16.114
with her sister.

06:16.158 --> 06:17.942
- Barry!
- Oh, no! Ohh!

06:17.986 --> 06:19.596
What?
You did!

06:19.640 --> 06:22.033
So, what, depending on this past
relationship with this woman,

06:22.077 --> 06:23.687
we might have to come up
with a plan "b."

06:23.731 --> 06:25.907
Is that what you're saying?

06:25.950 --> 06:27.474
- Yeah.
- Guys!

06:27.517 --> 06:29.171
Take a look at this.

06:34.829 --> 06:36.570
You still think he's a myth?

06:36.613 --> 06:39.442
Yeah! Come on.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.488
Batman's real.

07:08.253 --> 07:09.646
If I remember right,

07:09.690 --> 07:11.692
the radio station was this way.

07:11.735 --> 07:13.345
I'm surprised they put it
in the bad part of town.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.217
It's cute how you think
there's a good part of town.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.619
Looks like the one percenters

07:25.662 --> 07:27.142
bring the good part with them.

07:27.185 --> 07:31.451
This is why nobody
talks about Gotham, ok?

07:31.494 --> 07:33.714
City might as well be dead.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.803
Sounds like you guys
aren't from around here.

07:35.846 --> 07:37.805
Probably don't know,

07:37.848 --> 07:40.503
but Gotham tourism bureau
collects a tax

07:40.547 --> 07:42.505
on out of towners,

07:42.549 --> 07:45.769
so phones, wallets, watches now.

07:45.813 --> 07:48.511
You know what, fellas? I... we
don't want any trouble,

07:48.555 --> 07:51.166
so maybe we can just
talk this out, ok?

07:51.209 --> 07:54.343
Ha ha ha!
Talk it out.

07:54.386 --> 07:56.301
Ok. I'll talk first.

08:06.007 --> 08:07.138
Hey!

08:07.182 --> 08:08.966
Agh!

08:11.795 --> 08:13.623
Oh, great.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.020
On the ground now!

08:19.063 --> 08:22.545
All of you, on the ground!
Show me your hands!

08:22.589 --> 08:24.199
Oh, crap.

08:25.766 --> 08:28.159
I need SWAT at Nolan and Burton.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.640
Green arrow sighted at
Nolan and Burton.

08:30.684 --> 08:32.642
Sir, we don't want any trouble.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.601
Yeah. Tell that
to Oliver queen here.

08:34.644 --> 08:37.778
Oliver, stand down.

08:50.007 --> 08:52.575
Pattern recognition algo
is locked and loaded.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.142
Bringing it online now.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.839
You realize that this
may not work, right?

08:55.883 --> 08:57.580
Like, there may not be
a pattern to recognize.

08:57.624 --> 09:01.410
Is there a suggestion bound
within that dose of pessimism?

09:01.453 --> 09:03.325
Does the energy discharge
of the lightning

09:03.368 --> 09:05.066
look familiar to you?

09:05.109 --> 09:06.676
The quantum amplitude is consistent
with a dimensional breach.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.505
Exactly. We're gonna need
Cisco's help on this one.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.202
I've been summoned!

09:11.246 --> 09:13.161
Ok. That was a disturbingly
coincidental entrance.

09:13.204 --> 09:14.771
It wasn't coincidental.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.251
We'd been getting
the same red skies

09:16.294 --> 09:18.122
and freaky lightning
in central city,

09:18.166 --> 09:20.429
and I'll tell you this much...
It wasn't speed force.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.431
Wait, wait. Hold up.
"We'd been," "wasn't,"

09:22.474 --> 09:24.346
as in past tense?

09:24.389 --> 09:26.087
Interestingly, the atmospheric
phenomenon ceased

09:26.130 --> 09:28.132
the moment Barry and
Oliver left central city.

09:28.176 --> 09:29.699
It's like it packed up its
bags and followed them here.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.658
That's why we came.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.964
The phenomenon has to be related
to Barry and Oliver's...

09:34.008 --> 09:35.662
- Ok, Caitlin. Ok?
- Body swap?

09:35.705 --> 09:38.621
Ahem. Don't...
Don't say... ahem.

09:38.665 --> 09:43.191
I'm sorry.
Body... body what?

09:43.234 --> 09:48.152
You, uh... you
didn't tell her?

09:48.196 --> 09:53.636
Again,
tell me... heh... what?

09:58.598 --> 10:01.035
Um, excuse me, officer.

10:01.078 --> 10:03.211
Were you able to get
in touch with Laurel Lance

10:03.254 --> 10:05.169
at the star city
d.A.'S office or...

10:05.213 --> 10:07.781
Yeah. She said, uh, "I
think a night in jail

10:07.824 --> 10:09.826
would do them
some good."

10:09.870 --> 10:11.436
Heh.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.356
What were you thinking?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.402
That you were about to
get yourself shot.

10:20.445 --> 10:21.838
- You're welcome.
- I was deescalating

10:21.882 --> 10:23.623
the situation,
you know, like, uh...

10:23.666 --> 10:24.885
- Like I would?
- Uh-huh!

10:24.928 --> 10:26.669
Guess what, man.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.410
I handled it exactly
how you would!

10:28.453 --> 10:30.064
Ok. You guys, maybe taking on
each other's personalities

10:30.107 --> 10:33.197
worked for amazo,
but you were not gonna

10:33.241 --> 10:35.243
talk your way out
of getting mugged,

10:35.286 --> 10:37.767
and you escalated the
situation way too fast.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.595
So what would you have done?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.467
What I would have done is
supersped us right out of there.

10:42.511 --> 10:45.906
All they would have
seen is a gust of wind.

10:45.949 --> 10:47.734
I mean, hindsight is 20/20,

10:47.777 --> 10:49.257
but we'll follow
your lead next time.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.172
Because there will
really be a next time

10:51.215 --> 10:54.915
when someone threatens 3
superheroes with a gun.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.699
Good news.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.092
Somebody posted your bail.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.268
- Who?
- I don't know.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.705
Guess someone wanted to make
you guys their headache

11:02.749 --> 11:04.315
instead of mine.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.537
We'll show ourselves out.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.638
Please come with me.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.858
I'm guessing this belongs
to whoever bailed us out.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.642
I really think we've had

11:26.686 --> 11:28.078
enough distractions
for one night.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.906
Yeah. I agree
with my friend.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.082
We appreciate
the early release, whatever,

11:32.126 --> 11:33.867
but we're really fine
on our own.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.086
I'm afraid my employer insists.

11:37.566 --> 11:38.959
Ok.

11:39.002 --> 11:41.135
And you said it
wouldn't happen again.

12:05.812 --> 12:08.553
Bruce Wayne got us out of jail?

12:08.597 --> 12:10.207
Doesn't sound like him.

12:10.251 --> 12:13.733
No, it wasn't. Wayne
left Gotham 3 years ago.

12:13.776 --> 12:16.257
Why?
To go where?

12:16.300 --> 12:18.694
No one knows.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.478
So who's Manning the shop now?

12:27.529 --> 12:29.792
Apparently after he left,
Bruce's board of directors

12:29.836 --> 12:34.231
went to town with a bunch of
aggressive get-rich-quick deals.

12:34.275 --> 12:36.364
Yeah, but an abandoned building

12:36.407 --> 12:40.237
didn't bail us out, right?

12:40.281 --> 12:43.937
Whoa. That is definitely
not Bruce Wayne.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.073
Oliver queen.

12:50.117 --> 12:51.422
Ahem.

12:51.466 --> 12:54.817
Yeah, yeah.
I'm Oliver queen. Yeah.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.167
- And you are?
- The rain on your parade.

12:57.211 --> 12:59.343
If you're visiting Gotham
to compare grappling hooks

12:59.387 --> 13:01.476
with Batman, you are
out of luck.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.913
No one's seen him in years.

13:03.957 --> 13:06.350
Told you.

13:06.394 --> 13:07.830
Myth.

13:07.874 --> 13:11.312
I would never compare
myself to a total badass

13:11.355 --> 13:12.835
like Batman.

13:12.879 --> 13:16.578
What I think Oliver
is trying to say

13:16.621 --> 13:18.406
is thank you for getting
us out of jail.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.495
What Oliver's
actually trying to say is

13:20.538 --> 13:23.585
who are you, and why
are you helping us?

13:23.628 --> 13:25.326
Gotham has enough problems
without a guy

13:25.369 --> 13:28.372
in green leather showing off
his arrows to everyone,

13:28.416 --> 13:31.419
so the faster you find
what you're looking for,

13:31.462 --> 13:33.290
the faster you can get
the hell out of my city.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.118
Uh, but, what... what
should we call you...

13:35.162 --> 13:37.642
Rain, Ms. Parade?

13:37.686 --> 13:39.688
Kane, Kate Kane.

13:46.956 --> 13:49.306
You didn't tell her?!

13:49.350 --> 13:51.265
Oliver... the actual
Oliver thought they had

13:51.308 --> 13:53.484
enough problems
with Felicity already.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.878
Oh, and you didn't think to
loop us in on the fact that you

13:55.922 --> 13:58.098
were keeping the "freaky
Friday" situation on the hush?

13:58.141 --> 14:00.143
I was thinking it was
more like "quantum leap."

14:00.187 --> 14:02.058
No. If this were
like "quantum leap,"

14:02.102 --> 14:04.104
they'd only look like themselves when
they see themselves in the mirror...

14:04.147 --> 14:05.801
It depends on what type
of quantum leap...

14:05.845 --> 14:07.759
Shouldn't we concentrate on
what this lightning came from?

14:07.803 --> 14:09.500
- Right?
- Right, but...

14:09.544 --> 14:10.980
Oh. Ahem.

14:11.024 --> 14:13.113
Ok, guys. You don't
need to tip-toe around me.

14:13.156 --> 14:14.941
It's just a lot to process.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.856
It's not every day that
you find out that your ex

14:16.899 --> 14:18.683
is your husband and vice-versa.

14:18.727 --> 14:21.556
Yeah. Iris was, pretty freaked
out, too, when she sussed it out.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.558
Wait. Iris.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.603
You know, actually, John... right
before you came in,

14:25.647 --> 14:27.692
John was just saying that we need
to really handle that lightning...

14:27.736 --> 14:29.346
Iris was able to tell that
something was off with Barry?

14:29.390 --> 14:31.000
- No, not exactly.
- Oh, totally. I mean,

14:31.044 --> 14:32.697
it was like lover's intuition.
Stop.

14:32.741 --> 14:34.786
That's how you can
tell these two were...

14:34.830 --> 14:36.788
You know, Felicity, um, there's
something very strange going on here,

14:36.832 --> 14:38.921
so I wouldn't take this
as a commentary

14:38.965 --> 14:40.531
on you and Oliver's marriage.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.490
No. My marriage
with Oliver is strained

14:42.533 --> 14:44.971
by the fact that we've
become different people...

14:45.014 --> 14:48.365
Quite literally
in Oliver's case.

14:52.413 --> 14:54.850
If the lightning strikes are
attempted dimensional breaches,

14:54.894 --> 14:56.852
there might be a way to
stabilize the quantum flux

14:56.896 --> 14:59.507
to allow whatever's trying to get
through to get through, right?

14:59.550 --> 15:01.726
- Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah.

15:07.036 --> 15:09.212
You guys try facial recognition?

15:09.256 --> 15:11.736
One of Bruce's R&D guys
still works in the building.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.738
I can give this to him.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.827
Uh, we did try it,

15:15.871 --> 15:17.177
so thank you, but no luck.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.005
Besides, I'd think
if Wayne's R&D's

15:19.048 --> 15:20.441
in the same shape
as this building,

15:20.484 --> 15:21.964
it's not gonna really
do us any good.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.357
Suit yourself.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.749
Seems strange, doesn't it,

15:24.793 --> 15:27.056
that Bruce Wayne and
Batman disappeared

15:27.100 --> 15:28.579
from Gotham around
the same time.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.930
Well, when Batman
left, the city went

15:30.973 --> 15:32.496
to 5 different kinds of hell,

15:32.540 --> 15:35.673
which for Gotham is
really saying something.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.240
Took a toll on Bruce.

15:37.284 --> 15:40.026
Is that why he left?

15:40.069 --> 15:41.679
Still trying to figure that out.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.159
Right, but you work for him,

15:43.203 --> 15:44.465
and you don't know why he left?

15:44.508 --> 15:46.510
Who said I work for him?

15:47.555 --> 15:49.035
How'd it go with vesper?

15:49.078 --> 15:50.253
She hung up on me.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.081
Apparently, I did
sleep with her.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.604
- Hmm.
- Ok. The building is

15:53.648 --> 15:55.432
under renovation, so this is

15:55.476 --> 15:58.174
the best place for you
guys to work out of.

15:58.218 --> 16:02.439
Oh, and the, uh,
Wi-Fi password's "Alfred."

16:02.483 --> 16:04.224
So if vesper's not
gonna help us,

16:04.267 --> 16:05.660
we're just back at square one.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.270
No, we're not.
I lifted this off

16:07.314 --> 16:08.619
of a computer at the precinct.

16:08.663 --> 16:10.491
It should have
the entire gcpd database.

16:10.534 --> 16:12.188
You stole data from the police?

16:12.232 --> 16:15.365
No. No. The flash
did it.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.978
- It's not funny.
- I'm not laughing.

16:23.634 --> 16:27.203
Did you lose the coin flip on
who has to come talk to me?

16:27.247 --> 16:30.859
We didn't flip coins.
We drew straws.

16:30.902 --> 16:34.123
I'm kidding. Actually, I
wanted to come talk to you

16:34.167 --> 16:37.039
because I think I've got a
little bit more experience

16:37.083 --> 16:39.476
with alternate realities
than you do.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.174
So what words of wisdom
do you have for me?

16:41.217 --> 16:44.568
That Iris probably has a little
bit more experience, as well,

16:44.612 --> 16:46.962
and maybe that's why
she would have seen

16:47.006 --> 16:48.703
something that you didn't.

16:48.746 --> 16:51.053
As for Oliver keeping
you in the dark,

16:51.097 --> 16:55.057
when he and Barry tried to tell
us what was going on with them,

16:55.101 --> 16:59.583
we knocked them unconscious and
locked them in the pipeline.

16:59.627 --> 17:02.456
- Seriously?
- Wasn't our finest moment.

17:02.499 --> 17:05.675
Look. I'm sure that
that's the reason

17:05.720 --> 17:09.680
that Oliver didn't want to
take any chances with you.

17:09.723 --> 17:11.943
I appreciate you saying that...

17:14.163 --> 17:16.905
But it's just another excuse
in a long list of excuses

17:16.948 --> 17:18.385
for Oliver's behavior.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.126
Oliver does love you, Felicity.

17:20.169 --> 17:25.174
Yeah? Well, what's love
without respect or trust?

17:25.218 --> 17:27.089
I don't know,

17:27.133 --> 17:29.657
but as long as there is love,

17:29.700 --> 17:32.094
you can't give up on it.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.748
That's the one thing I do know

17:33.791 --> 17:36.142
after everything
I've been through,

17:36.185 --> 17:37.969
everything I've suffered.

17:41.234 --> 17:42.844
Thank you.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.935
Well, one good thing
about what's going on

17:46.978 --> 17:49.764
is that I have something
to distract me.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.244
Look at this.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.420
- That looks like...
- A quantum flux anchor.

17:53.463 --> 17:54.856
I'm pretty sure if we build it,

17:54.899 --> 17:57.946
whoever's trying
to breach through will come.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.556
Let's get to work.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.865
You really know
your way with a computer.

18:03.908 --> 18:06.259
Well, when I was first starting
out, I had to hold my own

18:06.302 --> 18:09.218
before Felicity showed up.

18:09.262 --> 18:11.525
Got him.
John Deegan.

18:11.568 --> 18:14.789
Oh. Illegal
experimentation, torture.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.747
Hmm. Seems like he was
conducting experiments

18:16.791 --> 18:19.054
on his own patients' brains.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.708
Sounds like a real charmer.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.318
Well, he was acquitted.
All the charges

18:22.362 --> 18:23.754
were dropped on technicalities.

18:23.798 --> 18:25.713
So where can we find him now?

18:25.756 --> 18:27.802
- No known address.
- What about employment?

18:27.845 --> 18:29.456
Well, he was fired, suspended

18:29.499 --> 18:31.022
by the medical board
for two years,

18:31.066 --> 18:34.156
but that was...
5 years ago.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.289
- So no idea where to find him.
- No.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.073
Except somewhere in Gotham.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.553
Needle in haystack.

18:39.596 --> 18:41.946
- All right.
- Where you going?

18:41.990 --> 18:43.818
I'm gonna put on my work clothes

18:43.861 --> 18:45.385
and do an X-ray flyby
of the city.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.430
I don't think miss Kate
would be too thrilled

18:47.474 --> 18:49.258
with us running around her city.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.739
Well, unless she has some
kryptonite stashed somewhere,

18:51.782 --> 18:53.697
I'm really not worried.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.970
Heh. You lost?

19:06.014 --> 19:12.151
No. No. Um, just needed to
clear my head for a sec.

19:12.194 --> 19:13.848
Actually, you know what?

19:13.891 --> 19:15.284
I'm sorry

19:15.328 --> 19:18.635
about the third degree earlier.

19:18.679 --> 19:20.855
I guess the name
Bruce Wayne carries

19:20.898 --> 19:23.814
a certain notoriety.

19:23.858 --> 19:26.556
Oh, I know.
Bruce Wayne's my cousin.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.602
Your cousin?

19:28.645 --> 19:30.865
That makes a lot of sense.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.867
Actually, I'm in the process

19:32.910 --> 19:36.784
of turning this building into a
real estate development firm,

19:36.827 --> 19:41.092
so this is
me hijacking his office.

19:41.136 --> 19:44.052
My cousin's actually
friends with Bruce.

19:44.095 --> 19:46.576
Um, well, frenemies.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.143
- Hmm.
- Heh.

19:50.580 --> 19:53.409
Do you ever wonder
if trying to keep

19:53.453 --> 19:55.629
his private life
from the public eye

19:55.672 --> 20:00.547
just got to be too much
for him and he broke?

20:00.590 --> 20:04.115
Heh. Sitting
at that desk,

20:04.159 --> 20:06.901
staring out that window,

20:06.944 --> 20:09.295
watching this city
that we grew up in

20:09.338 --> 20:13.168
rot at its core,

20:13.212 --> 20:15.605
you find a way to not break.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.740
Bruce didn't leave
Gotham without a fight.

20:21.829 --> 20:23.787
Hmm.

20:23.831 --> 20:27.051
You know, I got to say, all the
corporate billionaires I know

20:27.095 --> 20:31.621
wear versace and have
500 fewer tattoos.

20:31.665 --> 20:35.625
Hmm. Those are the ones
that you can see.

20:35.669 --> 20:38.715
Well, that's a mystery.

20:38.759 --> 20:43.242
Oh. Is this the...
The old bard himself? Ha!

20:46.027 --> 20:49.639
Hey. You... you wouldn't happen to
know a John Deegan, would you?

20:49.683 --> 20:52.033
I would, actually.

20:52.076 --> 20:54.862
He's a doctor at arkham asylum.

20:54.905 --> 20:57.517
Ah. I have to go
tell the boys.

20:57.560 --> 21:00.955
Uh, hey. Thanks for the
help and the chat.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.600
What the hell is this?

21:37.644 --> 21:38.949
No offense,
but you'd need at least

21:38.993 --> 21:40.429
5 ph.D.S for
the dumbed-down version.

21:40.473 --> 21:42.213
How about the very
dumbed-down version?

21:42.257 --> 21:44.520
It's a quantum flux anchor
that utilizes wave theory

21:44.564 --> 21:45.913
to fire nano-particulates

21:45.956 --> 21:47.610
across an Einstein-rosen bridge

21:47.654 --> 21:50.134
to create a secure claxon field.

21:50.178 --> 21:52.963
How about the very, very,
dumbed-down version?

21:53.007 --> 21:55.052
Felicity made a magnet
that will draw whoever's

21:55.096 --> 21:58.012
trying to breach through to us.

21:58.055 --> 22:00.841
You could have just said that.

22:00.884 --> 22:03.060
All right.
Field's stable.

22:03.104 --> 22:06.368
All readings are in the green.
You guys are good to go.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.593
I'm reading multiple
quantum surges.

22:13.636 --> 22:15.856
I don't think this is working!

22:15.899 --> 22:18.119
This is what working looks like!

22:23.385 --> 22:25.953
Man, voice cutting in and out:
Ca... you... hear me?

22:25.996 --> 22:28.521
You've got... to...
Get... book.

22:28.564 --> 22:30.174
Jay?

22:30.218 --> 22:32.873
Only... book... make this right.

22:32.916 --> 22:37.965
If you get the book,
you can fix this.

22:42.448 --> 22:45.799
Am I the only one who
thought that was very cool?

22:51.152 --> 22:53.197
So we're sure he works here?

22:53.241 --> 22:54.938
Well, it's probably too late
for him to still be at work,

22:54.982 --> 22:56.418
but if we find his office, maybe

22:56.462 --> 22:58.202
we can find his home
address or something.

22:58.246 --> 22:59.943
Do you think you have enough
of a grip on your powers

22:59.987 --> 23:01.554
to do a superspeed
reconnaissance?

23:01.597 --> 23:03.599
I don't think that we
should risk it if I don't.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.514
Ok. Well, then,
we break in,

23:05.558 --> 23:07.647
do some old-fashioned snooping.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.170
- Ohh!
- Aah!

23:09.213 --> 23:10.693
Aah!

23:10.737 --> 23:12.042
- Got new intel.
- Those lightning strikes,

23:12.086 --> 23:13.653
they were a flash
from another dimension

23:13.696 --> 23:15.176
trying to breach to us.

23:15.219 --> 23:17.178
We think it was Jay garrick

23:17.221 --> 23:19.006
or a Jay garrick.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.486
He said to fix the situation,

23:20.529 --> 23:22.966
we have to
"get the book."

23:23.010 --> 23:24.620
John Deegan was reading a book

23:24.664 --> 23:26.448
in the drawing Oliver drew.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.319
Ok. So we find
the book in there

23:28.363 --> 23:30.496
or we find Deegan, and we
make him tell us where it is.

23:30.539 --> 23:33.499
Wait, wait. Hold on. Another
flash from a parallel universe

23:33.542 --> 23:36.197
just lightnings in, tells us to
jump, and we ask, "how high?"

23:36.240 --> 23:38.460
If we want to sort
this thing out, then yes.

23:38.504 --> 23:41.463
I have no idea how we're gonna
break into a mental asylum.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.334
I have some ideas.

23:50.733 --> 23:52.300
Uh, how can I help you?

23:52.343 --> 23:55.390
New patient transfer
from Gotham central hospital.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.654
Dr. Danvers said arkham was
the more appropriate place

23:58.698 --> 24:01.701
to treat her...
Condition.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.006
What's the diagnosis?

24:03.050 --> 24:05.182
Persistent subthermal
homeostasis

24:05.226 --> 24:09.230
with, uh, involuntary
gelid substantiation.

24:09.273 --> 24:11.928
She gets cold and freezes stuff.

24:15.105 --> 24:18.326
Yeah. We got a few of those
in here like that.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.676
- Fill this out.
- Ok.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.112
We'll take it from here.

24:22.156 --> 24:23.723
Officer Allen,
it really is very...

24:23.766 --> 24:24.941
This is a gcpd-a.R.G.U.S.
Operation.

24:24.985 --> 24:26.813
We don't need your help.

24:36.953 --> 24:38.346
Whew.

24:47.921 --> 24:50.010
Barry... I mean,
Oliver, look.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.283
John Deegan.

25:10.160 --> 25:14.556
Oliver queen!
Ha ha! Whew.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.124
It's a genuine pleasure
to meet you, sir.

25:17.167 --> 25:18.734
He knows who you really are.

25:18.778 --> 25:20.214
Gentlemen, I was thinking,

25:20.257 --> 25:22.433
"why did I not become
the flash?"

25:22.477 --> 25:27.743
And it seems
changing reality itself,

25:27.787 --> 25:30.267
it's got a bit
of a learning curve,

25:30.311 --> 25:32.966
so, yeah.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.794
This actually explains a lot.

25:34.837 --> 25:37.492
You did this to us?

25:37.536 --> 25:38.928
You can undo it.

25:38.972 --> 25:41.496
That is true,
but I think the question is,

25:41.540 --> 25:45.544
um... why would I
want to?

25:55.641 --> 25:56.990
What the hell did he just do?

25:57.033 --> 25:58.861
He bought himself some time.

26:11.004 --> 26:12.527
What's happening?

26:12.571 --> 26:14.268
Trouble.

26:17.532 --> 26:19.447
The crazy bastard let
all the other crazy bastards

26:19.490 --> 26:20.753
out of their cages.

26:20.796 --> 26:22.537
All right. Get the patients
back in their rooms

26:22.581 --> 26:24.147
and find that book.

26:41.469 --> 26:45.473
Finally, the inmates
are running the asylum.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.214
Not for long!

26:57.093 --> 27:00.488
Fries, fries, fries, fries.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.446
Come on. Where is it?

27:02.490 --> 27:03.665
Are you ok?

27:03.709 --> 27:06.668
My cryostasis shut off
when the locks did.

27:06.712 --> 27:09.584
I... I need
to be cold.

27:11.325 --> 27:15.721
196 below zero.
196, he said.

27:15.764 --> 27:17.244
How does this thing work?

27:17.287 --> 27:18.680
Ok. Maybe you should
just take a step back.

27:18.724 --> 27:20.247
Just get away from me!

27:21.770 --> 27:25.339
Ohh. You cold bitch.

27:57.676 --> 27:58.764
Unh!

27:58.807 --> 28:00.243
Aah!

28:00.287 --> 28:01.680
Agh!

28:05.074 --> 28:07.555
No sign of Deegan or the book.

28:31.231 --> 28:32.885
What the hell
are you supposed to be?

28:39.761 --> 28:42.808
Nicely done. Floor it.

28:48.422 --> 28:50.076
Aah!

29:10.879 --> 29:14.404
Who's this badass?

29:14.448 --> 29:16.798
Agh.

29:16.842 --> 29:20.236
That's... not Batman.

29:20.280 --> 29:23.849
Kate Kane told you
to get out of Gotham.

29:23.892 --> 29:26.547
You should have listened to her.

29:29.376 --> 29:31.160
Guys, I've been
all over this place,

29:31.204 --> 29:32.771
and I can't find anything.

29:46.654 --> 29:50.092
Guys, I could use
a little backup.

29:50.136 --> 29:51.528
On it.

29:51.572 --> 29:52.791
On it.

30:14.334 --> 30:16.597
There you are.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.298
Took the words right
out of my mouth.

30:33.005 --> 30:35.137
Slippery.

30:35.181 --> 30:36.573
Listen to me.

30:41.230 --> 30:42.666
Caitlin.

30:47.933 --> 30:49.325
Wait. No, Oliver.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.240
Hey. Remember what
happened in central...

30:55.984 --> 30:57.290
Oliver!

30:58.334 --> 30:59.553
Oliver!

30:59.596 --> 31:01.163
Oliver's not here.

31:01.207 --> 31:03.122
In fact...

31:03.165 --> 31:05.515
No one's coming to save you.

31:09.215 --> 31:11.870
No one's coming to save you.

31:19.616 --> 31:22.750
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

31:22.793 --> 31:25.492
You left me to die on lian yu.

31:25.535 --> 31:28.974
Unfortunately for you...
Heh heh... I didn't.

31:38.418 --> 31:40.420
Does anybody copy?

31:49.211 --> 31:52.475
Because... I think we have
a new problem.

32:16.543 --> 32:18.284
Come on. You can do
better than that.

32:18.327 --> 32:19.850
You're a killer,
a depraved monster

32:19.894 --> 32:21.635
who found a way to
channel his darkness

32:21.678 --> 32:24.029
and pat himself
on the back for it!

32:24.072 --> 32:26.205
You'll never beat me.
Too slow, big heart.

32:26.248 --> 32:29.034
Mama raised you right, so right,

32:29.077 --> 32:31.471
you couldn't stop me
from killing her.

32:33.690 --> 32:35.649
Your father took
the coward's way out,

32:35.692 --> 32:38.304
and all these years, you
told yourself it was brave,

32:38.347 --> 32:41.785
but he was a coward
just like you.

32:41.829 --> 32:42.786
A failure.

32:42.830 --> 32:43.962
Selfish.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.920
Slow.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.009
Pathetic.

32:48.053 --> 32:49.489
Pathetic.

32:54.146 --> 32:56.061
Who the hell are you?

33:04.591 --> 33:07.724
No. Seriously,
who are you?

33:07.768 --> 33:10.553
Your friends were exposed
to a powerful hallucinogen.

33:10.597 --> 33:12.033
Are you guys all right?

33:12.077 --> 33:13.817
Define all right.

33:15.732 --> 33:18.866
So how does a book make
people change bodies?

33:18.909 --> 33:21.260
Deegan said he was using the
book to change reality.

33:21.303 --> 33:23.871
Same question. How does
a book change reality?

33:23.914 --> 33:25.829
We'll figure that out when
we get back to star city.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.918
Guys, we're gonna need
some help with this lock.

33:27.962 --> 33:29.877
Good. Then
you'll be leaving Gotham.

33:29.920 --> 33:32.053
You guys have caused enough
problems for one night.

33:32.097 --> 33:35.056
Hey. Would hitching a ride in the
Batmobile be out of the question?

33:35.100 --> 33:37.015
Get... out.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.451
Sure.

33:38.494 --> 33:40.627
- She really is like Batman.
- Yep.

33:47.416 --> 33:49.940
I don't do tearful good-byes.

33:49.984 --> 33:53.248
No. I... I just wanted
to wish you luck.

33:53.292 --> 33:56.077
Wherever your cousin is,

33:56.121 --> 33:59.907
I'm sure he's really
proud of you.

33:59.950 --> 34:02.257
X-ray vision.

34:02.301 --> 34:05.086
You really do have
a lot of tattoos.

34:05.130 --> 34:08.829
Somehow, I feel like Kara Danvers
doesn't have a single one.

34:10.612 --> 34:13.094
You know, it's such
a shame I have to go

34:13.138 --> 34:15.748
because I feel like we
would make a good team.

34:15.792 --> 34:17.751
World's finest.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.495
Heh heh.

34:30.677 --> 34:32.547
Oh. Look who
finally came back.

34:32.592 --> 34:34.681
With what looks like
a fairly infamous book.

34:34.724 --> 34:36.639
A book with
a cryptographic lock on it.

34:36.683 --> 34:37.987
Can you get to work on
opening it, please?

34:38.032 --> 34:39.599
We don't have a lot of time.

34:39.641 --> 34:41.643
Ok. Geek squad,
form up on me!

34:41.688 --> 34:43.385
Not much of a heartfelt reunion.

34:43.429 --> 34:44.952
She's getting used
to everything.

34:44.995 --> 34:47.476
Do you want me to talk to
her as, you know, you?

34:47.520 --> 34:50.262
I think I'm in enough trouble
with Felicity as it is,

34:50.304 --> 34:52.002
but no offense.

34:52.045 --> 34:53.786
Hey. Can I talk to you
for a minute, then?

34:53.830 --> 34:55.614
- Yeah. What's up?
- I just wanted to see

34:55.658 --> 34:56.877
how you're doing.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.835
I'm compartmentalizing.

34:58.879 --> 35:00.489
I'll fix things
with Felicity later.

35:00.533 --> 35:02.796
I don't mean with Felicity.

35:02.839 --> 35:05.712
We both saw some stuff
back at arkham.

35:05.755 --> 35:08.149
I saw evil flash.

35:08.193 --> 35:09.324
Eobard Thawne.

35:09.368 --> 35:11.283
I saw Malcolm merlyn.

35:11.326 --> 35:12.501
- Oh.
- I knew you'd been

35:12.545 --> 35:13.981
through a lot, but...

35:14.024 --> 35:15.504
I don't know, man.
I never realized.

35:15.548 --> 35:16.940
I don't know how you do it.

35:16.984 --> 35:18.507
I wouldn't be able to live

35:18.551 --> 35:20.292
with the burdens that you carry.

35:20.335 --> 35:21.684
Yes, you would.

35:21.728 --> 35:23.512
Barry, I always thought
that you had it easy,

35:23.556 --> 35:26.515
everything was just
sunshine and rainbows

35:26.559 --> 35:30.258
and... everybody likes you.

35:32.521 --> 35:35.568
You have real steel
in you, my friend.

35:35.611 --> 35:38.266
You can carry any burden
thrown your way.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.183
Some unsolicited advice?

35:42.227 --> 35:43.880
Hmm.

35:43.924 --> 35:47.319
Don't wait to work
things out with Felicity.

35:47.362 --> 35:50.148
Our line of work, you never
know how much time you got.

35:54.195 --> 35:56.415
Not only is the lock
cryptographic...

35:56.458 --> 35:58.373
It's metaphysical. The readings
I'm getting off this thing

35:58.417 --> 36:00.419
are nuts... and, yes,
that's a technical term.

36:00.462 --> 36:03.161
Um, may I speak
with Felicity for a minute?

36:03.204 --> 36:06.338
Sure thing, Barry...
Oliver... boliver.

36:06.381 --> 36:09.036
Stop helping.

36:09.079 --> 36:10.951
This must be strange for you.

36:10.994 --> 36:12.561
Oh. What gave you
that idea?

36:12.605 --> 36:15.303
I don't know. Maybe it's
easier for you to hear this

36:15.347 --> 36:17.349
coming from...
Barry Allen.

36:17.392 --> 36:19.046
What a stupid...

36:19.089 --> 36:20.178
Hear what?

36:22.267 --> 36:24.878
That we're gonna be ok.

36:24.921 --> 36:27.837
People change, Felicity.

36:27.881 --> 36:30.449
It means we're growing.

36:30.492 --> 36:32.494
It means we're evolving,

36:32.538 --> 36:33.713
except for one thing,

36:33.756 --> 36:35.889
one thing that
will not change...

36:38.500 --> 36:41.024
Is how I feel about you.

36:42.852 --> 36:44.898
Love is too small a word...

36:46.943 --> 36:50.556
And no matter who you are

36:50.599 --> 36:52.645
or... or what you become,

36:52.688 --> 36:54.429
no matter who I am

36:54.473 --> 36:57.084
or... or what I become...

36:58.607 --> 37:01.741
You will always be...

37:01.784 --> 37:03.917
You will always be
the love of my life.

37:05.658 --> 37:08.269
People change.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.315
That never will.

37:14.841 --> 37:17.147
Oliver, I...

37:25.852 --> 37:27.506
Jay?

37:27.549 --> 37:30.770
- No.
- Oh, my god. Dad?

37:30.813 --> 37:34.208
My name is Barry Allen.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.775
Hello, John.

37:35.818 --> 37:37.037
Do... do I know you?

37:37.080 --> 37:39.039
You're not wearing your ring.

37:39.082 --> 37:41.041
Things must be different here.

37:41.084 --> 37:43.696
Barry, where's there?

37:43.739 --> 37:45.828
My earth, earth 90.

37:45.872 --> 37:48.178
I've traveled from there
to warn you.

37:48.222 --> 37:50.529
- Warn us about what?
- His name is mar novu,

37:50.572 --> 37:53.358
but he calls himself
the monitor now.

37:53.401 --> 37:56.970
He's been unleashing
the book of destiny

37:57.013 --> 38:00.408
across the multiverse
to test different earths.

38:00.452 --> 38:02.671
Test them for what?

38:02.715 --> 38:05.718
A crisis that he
believes is coming.

38:05.761 --> 38:08.982
Novu thinks
the elseworlds created

38:09.025 --> 38:11.463
by the book of destiny
approximates

38:11.506 --> 38:15.554
the collision of realities
that we're facing.

38:15.597 --> 38:18.383
Guys...

38:18.426 --> 38:20.254
We got a situation.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.125
Cisco.

38:22.169 --> 38:26.304
That... that's him
from the vibe.

38:31.831 --> 38:33.702
Mar novu,

38:33.746 --> 38:35.356
you're gonna stand down.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.403
You're gonna use that book
to help us set reality right.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.143
Well, I certainly
wouldn't have placed it

38:40.187 --> 38:42.276
in Deegan's hands
if that were my intent.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.756
Enough.

38:43.799 --> 38:45.540
You will not do to this earth

38:45.584 --> 38:46.976
what you did to mine.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.370
I admire your
persistence, Barry.

38:55.289 --> 38:57.117
He said you were testing us.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.684
Indeed, and thus far,

38:58.727 --> 39:00.338
I am unimpressed.

39:00.381 --> 39:01.774
A crisis is imminent.

39:01.817 --> 39:03.384
Someone is coming,

39:03.428 --> 39:06.561
someone far, far more powerful
than myself.

39:06.605 --> 39:07.997
I mean to prepare.

39:08.041 --> 39:10.173
By giving a nut bar
an all-powerful

39:10.217 --> 39:11.871
reality-rewriting book?

39:11.914 --> 39:15.657
I am testing universes
to find one, I hope,

39:15.701 --> 39:17.093
strong enough to stand
against him.

39:17.137 --> 39:18.791
You're causing chaos,

39:18.834 --> 39:20.227
and you're blaming
everyone else!

39:20.270 --> 39:22.142
In the hope of finding
the champions

39:22.185 --> 39:24.231
that would save
the multiverse entire.

39:24.274 --> 39:27.147
You are the first of those
I've placed under fire

39:27.190 --> 39:30.498
who have managed to retrieve
the book of destiny...

39:34.328 --> 39:36.722
For all the good it did you.

39:36.765 --> 39:38.158
Enough of this.
Kara?

39:38.201 --> 39:40.378
Yeah. I'd love to.

39:43.511 --> 39:44.991
You show potential.

39:45.034 --> 39:46.819
Let us see if it's
anything more.

39:46.862 --> 39:48.560
What is he talking about, Barry?

39:54.522 --> 39:56.350
I offered you godhood,

39:56.394 --> 39:59.484
and you squandered it
on a petty dream.

39:59.527 --> 40:01.486
Do better.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.444
Think bigger.

40:11.713 --> 40:13.585
Ohh.

40:28.861 --> 40:30.689
What the hell?

40:30.732 --> 40:33.169
Where'd he go?
What the hell?

40:33.213 --> 40:35.433
He went to give
Deegan the book... back.

40:35.476 --> 40:37.173
How do you know?

40:39.437 --> 40:41.917
He did it again.
He rewrote reality.

40:41.961 --> 40:43.571
How far do you think

40:43.615 --> 40:45.268
the changes go this time?

40:50.317 --> 40:52.406
- Freeze!
- On the ground!

40:52.450 --> 40:54.060
Now!

40:55.757 --> 40:57.890
Uh... speed us out of here.

40:57.933 --> 41:01.589
I can't.
Can you?

41:01.633 --> 41:04.070
Nope.

41:04.113 --> 41:05.637
Oliver queen.

41:08.988 --> 41:11.077
I've been waiting to do this

41:11.120 --> 41:13.427
for a long time.

41:14.907 --> 41:16.125
Unh!

41:17.649 --> 41:19.172
Aah!

41:24.220 --> 41:26.527
Should I follow you? What...

41:26.571 --> 41:27.920
Hey!

41:44.284 --> 41:47.374
There's no place you can run
where I can't find you.

41:48.941 --> 41:50.725
It's over.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.322
Greg, move your head.
