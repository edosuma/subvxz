02:07.000 --> 02:09.195
Hey, Mom. What you doing?

02:09.400 --> 02:13.393
I'm looking through the Valentines I've
gotten from your father over the years.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.757
He was really
quite the romantic in his day.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.439
"I lik e coffee
I lik e tea

02:21.640 --> 02:23.870
I lik e you
I lik e me"

02:28.960 --> 02:31.076
He was really stuck on us.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.478
Oh, here's something
you don't see every day.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.553
What? A Valentine's for Bud?

02:40.200 --> 02:42.919
- Yes.
- Oh, wow.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.919
It's never even been opened.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.315
Well, hold it up to the light.
See who it's from.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.317
Oh, good idea.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.911
"Bernice Winchester."

03:01.120 --> 03:04.908
I remember this. Bernice gave it to me
and I was supposed to give it to Bud.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.072
- When?
- Six years ago.

03:08.720 --> 03:12.998
Well, you can just give it to him today,
unless he's gotten some new ones.

03:13.240 --> 03:16.550
Well, we'll know soon. I think
I hear him checking the mailbox now.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.398
Damn you!

03:19.080 --> 03:21.150
Damn you all!

03:21.360 --> 03:24.477
Damn the whole damned world!

03:25.400 --> 03:26.799
I'll give it to him today.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.510
I take it there's no mail.

03:39.760 --> 03:42.638
Well, actually,
you got a Valentine's Day card.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.313
Yeah, right.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.677
Bud, there really
is a card here for you.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.270
Really, Mommy? Really?

03:51.920 --> 03:54.388
It's not another one from Grandma?

03:55.840 --> 03:58.195
Or Buck?

04:00.840 --> 04:03.229
What? Dinner?

04:03.600 --> 04:05.989
No? Okay.

04:06.640 --> 04:09.154
Before you open it,
there's something I should tell you.

04:09.360 --> 04:13.114
Now, I was supposed to give this
to you six years ago, but I forgot.

04:13.320 --> 04:16.039
Well, because quite frankly,
you repulsed me.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.911
Come on, it's just a stupid
Valentine's card.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.759
It's not like you missed
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.356
"Dearest Bud, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

04:29.840 --> 04:34.391
My parents won't be home tonight
and I need you more than anything.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.316
Please don't stand me up.
It would destroy me.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.511
Love, Bernice Winchester."

04:47.360 --> 04:48.793
Kelly...

04:50.000 --> 04:52.150
...do you know
who Bernice Winchester is?

04:53.240 --> 04:56.835
Yeah. She's a girl we went
to school with who liked you...

04:57.080 --> 05:00.197
...and coincidentally got kicked
in the head a lot during soccer.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.758
Not quite, Miss Festival Seating.

05:07.520 --> 05:12.230
For your information, Bernice
Winchester is now Crystal Brooks.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.438
Crystal Brooks the pop star?

05:14.680 --> 05:16.193
And she likes our Bud?

05:17.800 --> 05:21.634
I mean, of course she likes our Bud.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.593
Who wouldn't? Bud sizzles.

05:27.240 --> 05:28.559
Well, I'm gonna find Crystal.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.553
I'm gonna find her
and tell her I never got her card.

05:36.040 --> 05:40.079
Peg, something weird's going on.
Daughters are going wild...

05:40.280 --> 05:44.432
...men are openly weeping and women
are storing chocolate in their cheeks.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.717
Is it winter?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.275
Al, do you know
what day it is today?

05:51.480 --> 05:54.677
Well, sure I do.
It's... It's our anniversary.

05:55.760 --> 05:59.878
It's Valentine's Day.
I take it you got me nothing.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.390
Come on, Peg,
I knew it was Valentine's Day.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.717
I got you something right here.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.513
I got you this here dollar.

06:07.720 --> 06:11.429
Now, this dollar
is a special dollar, Peg...

06:11.680 --> 06:16.515
...because, if you see,
the serial number ends in a... D.

06:16.720 --> 06:21.510
D means "Happy Valentine's Day."

06:29.640 --> 06:31.995
"Day," Peg.

06:32.920 --> 06:36.754
You stink, Al. Stink.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.190
It's the smell of fear, Peg.

06:40.840 --> 06:43.991
Come on, honey.
You were so romantic in high school.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.679
Why, just look at this.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.993
"I love your hooters, I love your ass,
What say we meet after class?"

06:56.640 --> 07:00.269
I was the silver-tongued devil,
wasn't I?

07:02.000 --> 07:03.672
I want you to be like that again.

07:03.920 --> 07:07.515
Well, Peg,
I want you to be like that again.

07:08.440 --> 07:10.635
- Oh, never mind.
- What's the matter, Peg?

07:10.840 --> 07:12.956
- I want romance.
- Well, what is romance?

07:13.160 --> 07:14.559
You figure it out.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.518
That takes me back
to the honeymoon.

07:17.640 --> 07:20.871
Don't tell me what's romantic.
I know what's romantic.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.519
Kelly, what's romantic?

07:22.760 --> 07:27.675
Daddy, you know. Women like candy
and flowers and cards.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.916
Not with some naked fat chick
on it going:

07:30.120 --> 07:32.236
"I know it's around here somewhere."

07:32.880 --> 07:34.996
I like that one.

07:35.920 --> 07:41.040
Daddy, it's Valentine's Day. Women
like men to be sweet and sensitive.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.793
Whoa, babe, your knobs look huge.

07:47.120 --> 07:50.749
- You ready?
- Yes, and don't call me "babe."

07:51.160 --> 07:54.311
Daddy, this is my Valentine's date,
Mayhem.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.518
Charmed.

07:58.360 --> 07:59.759
Bye.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.109
Oh, to be young and free.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.750
What the hell?
I'm good-looking and kept.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.355
Oh, Jefferson, you Judas.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.676
You knew the beast of all holidays
was upon us.

08:19.880 --> 08:23.111
Now where can I go
get some Valentine Day crap?

08:23.760 --> 08:29.198
Look, Al, it's 7:30 on Valentine's Day.
The malls are picked clean.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.470
- Hey, Mr. D'Arcy.
- Hey, Bud.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.796
You tell Kelly
I found Crystal Brooks.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.798
She's performing here
and she's staying at the Emperor Hotel.

08:37.039 --> 08:39.235
I'm gonna go see her
and set things straight.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.113
"Ha, ha, witchy woman. Bite me."

08:44.080 --> 08:45.672
Did you get that?

08:45.880 --> 08:48.838
Yeah. He wants Emperor Crystal
to bite him.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.238
Anyway, Al,
here's what you better do.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.351
You better get thee
to the Valentine store.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.318
Good idea.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.277
What's a Valentine store?

09:09.600 --> 09:12.831
Well, it's a specialty shop
that caters to rogue husbands like you.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.031
It's a little more expensive.
Their motto is:

09:15.240 --> 09:18.198
"You're so desperate,
we don't need a motto."

09:19.080 --> 09:23.073
Well, next time you ought to think
and shop ahead like me.

09:45.040 --> 09:48.112
Good day.
Good day, my good man.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.829
Would you be so kind
as to tell Miss Brooks...

09:51.040 --> 09:53.554
...that Bud Bundy's here at last?
Here at last.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.797
Thank God Almighty,
he's here at last.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.350
Well, I see someone's
Hooked-on-Phonics tape...

10:04.560 --> 10:06.118
...was lost in the mail.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.512
No problem.

10:11.560 --> 10:16.759
You tell Miss Brooks
that Bud is here...

10:16.960 --> 10:19.758
...and there's a cool nickel in it
for you.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.194
Now what do you say?

10:46.960 --> 10:49.599
Hello again, my good man.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.030
I think perhaps you mistook me...

10:52.240 --> 10:54.834
...for either one of Miss Brook's
eager young groupies...

10:55.040 --> 10:57.156
...or something made by Wham-O.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.519
Now, if you'll notice...

11:00.720 --> 11:04.076
...I have here a handwritten card
from our Miss Brooks...

11:04.280 --> 11:07.272
...which should prove beyond a doubt,
not only do I know her...

11:07.480 --> 11:10.438
...but at one time
I could have even boinked her.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.798
Now...

11:16.600 --> 11:18.431
...you have three seconds
to announce me.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.434
It's Bud Bundy.

11:30.280 --> 11:36.674
I have here this last box
of 12 bite-size assorted chocolates.

11:38.240 --> 11:42.028
The opening bid is $25.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.077
Get a move on, Omar, it's after 9.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.756
In that case, the opening bid is $35.

11:48.440 --> 11:50.749
Thirty-five dollars.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.594
- Do I hear 45?
- Forty-five.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.673
- Fifty-five.
- Do I hear 65?

11:56.920 --> 11:58.751
Sixty-five.

11:59.160 --> 12:02.232
- Seventy-five!
- Do I hear 85?

12:02.520 --> 12:03.635
I'll go...

12:08.440 --> 12:11.477
Sold to the... Shoe salesman?

12:12.840 --> 12:16.992
- Yes.
- For $75.

12:17.240 --> 12:21.677
I won! I won!
I bought chocolates for $75. Give me.

12:47.320 --> 12:50.039
Okay, Sasquatch...

12:51.200 --> 12:52.474
...it's checkout time.

12:57.640 --> 13:02.236
Oh, good, they sent
a cute one this time.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.519
What?

13:05.040 --> 13:08.794
Oh, for the love of God, no, no!

13:11.000 --> 13:13.912
Help me!

13:23.760 --> 13:27.389
Mommy!

13:32.400 --> 13:36.439
Now serving number 2009.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.033
That's mine.

13:38.840 --> 13:42.276
I'd like one dozen red roses.

13:42.520 --> 13:46.069
One bouquet of wallet breakers.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.512
Okay, sir,
now, how do you intend to pay?

13:52.760 --> 13:55.718
Cash, check or deed to your house?

13:56.560 --> 13:57.675
Do you take blood?

14:05.600 --> 14:07.716
What can I get for 50 bucks?

14:22.600 --> 14:25.034
Now I know how Tom Arnold feels.

14:30.320 --> 14:34.632
Well, it's about time you got here.
You must walk my Winky.

14:35.600 --> 14:39.559
I'm not your bellhop.
You can walk your own Winky.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.636
Pay you $50.
Here, Winky. Here, boy.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.550
Whoa, boy!

14:57.800 --> 14:59.313
Winky!

16:27.040 --> 16:30.316
This is a good hotel.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.238
Mommy!

16:50.880 --> 16:52.438
Hi there.

16:52.640 --> 16:54.756
It's me. Bud Bundy.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.918
Well, I guess
you don't recognize me...

16:58.120 --> 17:00.998
...because I bulked up a little
since the last time you saw me.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.756
Let me refresh your memory.

17:05.960 --> 17:09.031
Six years ago,
you sent me a touching Valentine...

17:09.240 --> 17:11.310
...which I never received until today.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.637
Now, I know we can never be lovers.

17:17.520 --> 17:22.513
Look, if it's any consolation at all,
I would have come over that night...

17:22.720 --> 17:27.999
...and we would have made beautiful,
passionate, hot monkey love.

17:31.360 --> 17:34.591
Crystal, someone's here to see you.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.039
Hi there.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.800
It's me. Bud Bundy.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.709
- I guess you don't recognize me...
- I heard you, Bud.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.912
That was a long time ago.
I've moved on.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.236
Well, so have I.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.829
There are plenty of women
in my life too.

17:58.040 --> 18:01.874
Just five minutes ago,
I had group sex.

18:05.160 --> 18:08.948
Look, I just came to apologize.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.834
I guess there's nothing else to say.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.513
Good luck with your career.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.790
I'm going to college myself...

18:17.040 --> 18:19.793
...unlike people
who go to college together.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.473
No chance on that lover thing?

18:23.840 --> 18:24.829
Sorry.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.031
I guess I'll see you, huh?

18:31.760 --> 18:34.797
Don't bother. I'll throw myself out.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.596
Well, right behind you.

18:40.440 --> 18:43.159
Oh, so what if Al forgot
Valentine's Day?

18:43.360 --> 18:46.670
He's not an elephant. He's a pig.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.755
Besides, Valentine's Day
is degrading.

18:49.960 --> 18:53.270
It's just another commercial holiday
made up by Merlin Olsen...

18:53.480 --> 18:57.075
...and the Hershey candy mob
to fatten their wallets on our guilt.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.430
It's just disgusting.

18:59.880 --> 19:03.919
- Is Jefferson getting you anything?
- lf he knows what's good for him.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.232
I would have gotten him something...

19:06.440 --> 19:08.715
...but I seem to have misplaced
my credit card.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.956
Happy Valentine's Day, honey.

19:14.200 --> 19:16.953
Oh, Jefferson.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.952
A crystal penguin.

19:21.400 --> 19:25.109
- Yeah.
- It's beautiful.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.548
Must have cost a fortune.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.673
Hey, price means nothing to me.

19:32.680 --> 19:36.355
Say, isn't that your credit card?

19:37.680 --> 19:42.276
Why, yes. Oh, this is my lucky day.

19:42.840 --> 19:48.039
Let's go home, honey, because I have
a special Valentine treat for you too.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.271
- What's that?
- Well, that all depends...

19:55.480 --> 19:59.029
...on whether or not this bird
was charged to my credit card.

20:00.560 --> 20:04.189
Marcie, it's not me, it's the voices.
They compel me.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.950
Kelly, I thought
you were out with Maytag.

20:15.880 --> 20:18.599
Mayhem. He was my 8:00 date.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.638
My real date is Pinworm.
He's picking me up at 11.

20:21.840 --> 20:24.274
Well, if he makes bail.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.551
Happy...

20:28.520 --> 20:30.238
What is it?

20:30.560 --> 20:32.118
Valentine's Day.

20:32.680 --> 20:36.229
Valentine's Day.
Here's your...

20:36.600 --> 20:38.511
Here's your candy.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.517
Here's your card.

20:42.560 --> 20:46.872
And if you get this in the ground
by spring, here's your flowers.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.640
Bean sprouts.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.952
Oh, Al, you're wonderful.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.989
You're a little slice of heaven
yourself.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.634
- Can I go now, Peg?
- Oh, let's go upstairs together.

21:01.840 --> 21:04.638
What? No, wait.
We had a deal. No sex.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.637
- That was on Easter.
- Well, what's this?

21:06.840 --> 21:09.638
- Valentine's.
- Oh, Peg!

21:17.320 --> 21:19.038
Hey, Bud.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.753
What happened with Crystal?

21:20.960 --> 21:25.795
Well, I apologized, she understood...

21:26.000 --> 21:30.152
...and then her bodyguard Skee-Balled
me the entire length of the building.

21:30.760 --> 21:34.116
I did, however,
meet a lovely woman named Rita.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.359
And I learned something.

21:36.560 --> 21:40.792
In space, no one really
can hear you scream.

21:42.920 --> 21:46.390
- Good night.
- Bud, I'm really sorry.

21:46.640 --> 21:50.394
If anyone gives me a love note for you
again, I promise I'll deliver it. Okay?

21:51.280 --> 21:54.272
You're not saying that
because you know I'll never get one?

22:06.240 --> 22:09.073
- Kelly? I'm Crystal Brooks.
- Oh, hi.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.350
- Is Bud here?
- Yeah, you want me to get him?

22:11.560 --> 22:13.198
No, I've gotta get to my concert.

22:13.400 --> 22:17.109
Howie Mandel opens for me
and the crowd hates it when I'm late.

22:17.320 --> 22:19.390
Would you please
give him this message?

22:19.600 --> 22:22.956
Tell him to meet me
at the hotel after the concert.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.428
- Okay.
- Please.

22:24.640 --> 22:27.200
- Don't worry. I will.
- lf he stands me up this time...

22:27.400 --> 22:29.072
...he's had it.
- Okay. Bye.

22:29.720 --> 22:32.188
- Hey, Bud.
- Yeah?

22:32.400 --> 22:35.995
Whoa, babe,
your butt looks bitching.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.037
- You ready?
- Yeah.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.556
Wait. There's something
I was supposed to do.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.120
Oh, my coat.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.512
I would forget my head
if it wasn't attached to...

22:53.920 --> 22:57.230
Well, I forgot what it was attached to.
Let's go.
