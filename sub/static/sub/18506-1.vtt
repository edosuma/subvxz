00:41.306 --> 00:43.642
Michael Clarke.

00:47.846 --> 00:51.584
This is an initiation.
Not yours.

00:52.517 --> 00:54.652
Mine.

00:54.787 --> 00:57.890
PC Plod in the driver's seat
is one of ours.

00:58.023 --> 01:01.227
Corrupt little pig.

01:01.359 --> 01:04.296
Today, we go from hooligans
to fucking gang members,

01:04.430 --> 01:07.433
and the price of that ticket
is two dead cops.

01:07.567 --> 01:11.837
You... and our friend
in the driver's seat.

01:11.969 --> 01:15.240
I've seen you at our games,
beating on my boys.

01:15.374 --> 01:17.409
You look like
you're enjoying yourself.

01:17.543 --> 01:20.480
"Hooligan in uniform,"
I believe the papers called you.

01:20.612 --> 01:23.448
Well, now it's time
to give a bit back.

01:23.582 --> 01:27.285
Oh, don't take it personally,
mate.

01:27.419 --> 01:32.090
Don't worry, I'll let your wife
know that you were crying

01:32.224 --> 01:33.960
as your head
hit the fucking concrete.

01:37.895 --> 01:39.865
She's dead.

01:43.635 --> 01:45.838
(banging)

01:47.038 --> 01:48.608
(shouting)

01:50.710 --> 01:56.648
Mate, they paid me off!
They paid me off!

01:56.781 --> 01:58.850
- I'm sorry!
- You fool!

01:58.984 --> 02:00.419
I'm fucking sorry!

02:00.552 --> 02:03.288
- Sorry.
- They were gonna kill you too.

02:03.421 --> 02:05.325
(driver groans)

02:09.929 --> 02:15.001
Oi, mate, stay still.
It'll make it easier.

02:17.035 --> 02:18.905
Your pig mate
will be dead soon too.

02:20.606 --> 02:23.876
- The ultimate irony, innit?
- What?

02:24.844 --> 02:27.946
You lot, for you
to feel like real men.

02:28.079 --> 02:31.049
You spend most of your time
acting like complete cunts.

02:31.184 --> 02:33.151
- Outnumbered.
- That's what they said.

02:35.953 --> 02:38.490
- (man screams)
- This your boy, is it?

02:38.624 --> 02:41.025
(bone snaps)

02:41.160 --> 02:42.761
(man screams)

02:42.894 --> 02:44.262
(sirens approach)

02:45.863 --> 02:48.734
- Don't let that stop you, boys.
- It's the fucking pigs!

02:57.776 --> 02:59.377
Clarke.

02:59.511 --> 03:02.315
I'm Chief Inspector Hawkins.

03:10.388 --> 03:11.656
What am I doing in here?

03:11.791 --> 03:13.626
It's for your own protection,

03:13.758 --> 03:17.196
but there's no need
for that now. Come with me.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.512
By my count,
it was eight against one.

03:33.645 --> 03:36.916
Low-level hooligans looking
for their sacrificial lamb;

03:37.048 --> 03:38.216
in this case, you.

03:38.350 --> 03:39.818
Where's Harris?

03:39.952 --> 03:42.520
He's in hospital
with the others.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.823
We'll file charges.

03:44.957 --> 03:49.960
Seven police officers in as
many months killed by hooligans.

03:50.095 --> 03:53.566
What starts on the terraces
ends up as organized criminality

03:53.698 --> 03:55.299
and they all want a piece of it.

03:55.434 --> 03:57.536
Think it a badge of honor.

03:57.668 --> 04:01.873
Yet here you are, Mr. Clarke,
a survivor.

04:02.006 --> 04:04.209
Took me a while to dig up
your files.

04:04.343 --> 04:07.512
Been on compassionate leave.

04:07.645 --> 04:12.218
Your wife... Think yourself
a bit of a hero, do you?

04:12.351 --> 04:14.120
Thrill-seeking?

04:14.252 --> 04:19.825
You know what I think, Clarke?
It takes one to know one.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.295
Hooligan in uniform, wasn't that
what the papers called you?

04:23.428 --> 04:25.964
Itching for a fight?

04:26.098 --> 04:29.601
I need people like you, Clarke.

04:29.735 --> 04:31.670
My superiors
have doubted my idea,

04:31.803 --> 04:33.705
think you don't have
the temperament for it,

04:33.839 --> 04:38.410
but I won't have you waste your
talents, piss your life away.

04:38.543 --> 04:41.313
- For what?
- Undercover.

04:42.882 --> 04:45.050
This is the long game, Clarke.

04:45.183 --> 04:48.487
I need officers to infiltrate
and gather evidence.

04:49.988 --> 04:53.691
When I've shown you these files,
you'll need to decide.

04:53.825 --> 04:57.995
Technically, I cannot ask you to
endanger yourself or order you

04:58.130 --> 05:01.132
to undertake what I'm asking.
You must volunteer.

05:06.538 --> 05:14.212
Terence Turner, aka Uno
or Numero Uno, the number one.

05:14.346 --> 05:16.481
I believe he's the head
of a criminal organization

05:16.615 --> 05:18.417
responsible
for football violence,

05:18.550 --> 05:21.553
organized bare-knuckle
fights, illegal gambling,

05:21.687 --> 05:24.957
drug import and export,
human trafficking and murder.

05:26.024 --> 05:27.526
You name it, if it's illegal

05:27.659 --> 05:29.928
and they can make money
out of it, they probably will.

05:30.062 --> 05:32.531
This guy is the catch.

05:32.663 --> 05:36.668
That's the last time
we saw Terence Turner.

05:36.801 --> 05:40.939
He put 17 people in hospital,
drew a lot of heat.

05:41.072 --> 05:43.608
There was a warrant out
for his arrest but then,

05:43.741 --> 05:46.444
like a ghost, he was gone.

05:46.577 --> 05:48.012
We think he left England,

05:48.147 --> 05:50.815
began to build a criminal empire
overseas, but now he's back

05:50.949 --> 05:53.219
and we haven't been able
to touch him thus far.

05:53.351 --> 05:54.919
He's got police on his payroll,

05:55.053 --> 05:58.190
and they hemorrhage information
left, right and center.

05:58.322 --> 06:02.560
So you can understand my need
for secrecy in this case.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.762
Those low-level thugs
you encountered today

06:04.897 --> 06:08.067
would have been new members
of his gang were it not for you.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.135
I've figured out various ways
to infiltrate his organization,

06:11.269 --> 06:12.805
but until the time is right,

06:12.937 --> 06:15.373
everything must look completely
on the level

06:15.507 --> 06:19.011
and today, you put
a fair few men in hospital.

06:19.144 --> 06:21.079
You'll be expelled
from the force

06:21.212 --> 06:23.915
and sent to prison for GBH.

06:24.048 --> 06:25.316
No cover story?

06:25.450 --> 06:28.053
It's too dangerous.
This has got to look real.

06:30.923 --> 06:35.594
Now's your chance, Clarke,
to do something important,

06:35.728 --> 06:40.031
something that matters...
make her proud.

06:42.601 --> 06:44.769
I'll call on you
when the time's right.

06:55.180 --> 06:59.584
(indistinct) ...of grievous
bodily harm with intent

06:59.717 --> 07:02.286
which carries a maximum penalty
of life imprisonment,

07:02.420 --> 07:03.989
for which
you have pleaded guilty.

07:04.123 --> 07:06.057
You have no previous
convictions.

07:06.190 --> 07:08.661
Due to your excellent record
of service to the police force,

07:08.793 --> 07:10.329
you have been convicted
following trial

07:10.462 --> 07:12.598
to serving four years in prison.
(voice becomes clearer)

07:12.731 --> 07:15.601
Is there anything you would like
to state for the record?

07:17.368 --> 07:18.904
Can I go?

07:27.144 --> 07:29.014
(screams)

07:37.589 --> 07:39.190
(woman cries)

07:46.697 --> 07:48.433
Get it done.

07:58.442 --> 08:01.413
I'll let your brother
deal with this one.

08:03.716 --> 08:05.351
It's his mess.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.889
(she sighs)

08:12.890 --> 08:14.392
Fine.

08:40.051 --> 08:41.921
(lock clanks)

08:56.301 --> 08:58.303
(taps phone keys)

09:00.037 --> 09:01.739
- (phone rings)
- (indistinct voice)

09:01.873 --> 09:04.410
(whispers) Sir, it's Baker.

09:04.542 --> 09:06.678
Does he look like
the marrying type?

09:09.314 --> 09:12.151
"Will you marry me?

09:12.283 --> 09:14.452
I'd love you
to come and meet my mother."

09:18.022 --> 09:20.593
Not one of my best lines
but it worked on her.

09:25.664 --> 09:30.369
As for my mother, well, you can
say hello to her in passing.

09:32.070 --> 09:33.973
She's up there somewhere.

09:43.515 --> 09:45.384
Put her out of her misery.

09:47.018 --> 09:47.918
No!

09:48.052 --> 09:49.187
No!

09:49.320 --> 09:50.555
(gunshot)

09:53.190 --> 09:55.161
MAN: <i>Where are you?</i>

10:02.033 --> 10:05.503
(whispers) I'm at 101
container yard on the docks.

10:05.637 --> 10:07.238
I've just heard gunshots.

10:16.580 --> 10:21.286
<i>I've just checked,
there's an abandoned unit.</i>

10:21.419 --> 10:25.357
<i>Number 37. Make your way there.</i>

10:26.825 --> 10:29.862
<i>I'll be there in 20 minutes.</i>

10:29.994 --> 10:31.663
<i>You can do this.</i>

10:32.296 --> 10:33.431
OK.

10:40.905 --> 10:42.974
This is Chief Inspector Hawkins.

10:43.108 --> 10:47.045
I need to speak to Ingham about
a prisoner transfer immediately.

10:47.179 --> 10:48.447
(man answers indistinctly)

10:51.116 --> 10:54.520
It's your lucky day, mate.
You're being transferred.

10:54.652 --> 10:56.220
Well, I say lucky day,
it's more like

10:56.353 --> 10:58.556
out of the frying pan
and into the fire, really.

11:00.191 --> 11:01.759
(door unlocks)

11:04.628 --> 11:06.031
Up you get.

11:20.344 --> 11:22.680
(distant alarm)

11:31.989 --> 11:33.558
Stay down.

11:34.459 --> 11:35.727
I'm sorry, sir.

11:35.860 --> 11:38.462
There's nothing
to be sorry about, Baker.

11:38.595 --> 11:40.898
The other young lady
has already been identified.

11:41.031 --> 11:45.002
Tatiana Gorecki,
shot twice through the chest.

11:45.136 --> 11:46.772
Oh, fuck.

11:51.575 --> 11:52.911
(vomits)

11:59.984 --> 12:03.053
Effects of the adrenaline
wearing off.

12:03.188 --> 12:07.559
- What are we gonna do?
- We've come too far to stop now.

12:07.693 --> 12:09.228
I'll drop you at my house,

12:09.360 --> 12:12.696
then I'll pick up Clarke.
We need to brief him ASAP.

12:12.830 --> 12:14.199
Who's Clarke?

12:14.331 --> 12:17.869
I'll tell you about him
on the way. Keep your head down.

12:28.345 --> 12:31.382
HAWKINS: Key's in
the back door. I won't be long.

12:31.516 --> 12:33.285
Clean yourself up.

12:58.310 --> 13:01.280
Thank you, gentlemen,
I'll take it from here.

14:02.773 --> 14:05.209
So, what's your plan
to get me in?

14:08.613 --> 14:11.950
Mark Griffith,
he's the number two.

14:12.083 --> 14:15.153
Always looking to recruit
fresh blood, new talent.

14:15.286 --> 14:18.855
People with the right kind of
attitude, the right skill set.

14:18.989 --> 14:21.526
Do you know him?
Have you heard of him?

14:21.660 --> 14:24.429
I know the name.
I've never seen him, though.

14:24.563 --> 14:27.666
We need hard evidence to bring
these bastards to justice.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.233
Tell me more
about this Griffith.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.703
He runs a bare-knuckle
boxing match every two weeks.

14:31.836 --> 14:35.539
That's where he recruits.
You need to gain his trust.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.375
And how exactly am I
meant to do that?

14:37.508 --> 14:40.445
Says here in your file you speak
some Polish. Is that right?

14:41.246 --> 14:43.315
(speaks Polish)

14:43.449 --> 14:45.784
You've been inside long enough,
Clarke.

14:45.916 --> 14:49.853
No one will doubt the
credibility of your story now.

14:49.988 --> 14:52.457
MICHAEL:
So who am I looking at now?

14:52.590 --> 14:57.327
James Goodall, takes the bets
at all the boxing matches.

14:57.461 --> 14:58.963
Slippery character.

14:59.097 --> 15:01.900
We installed some cameras
to watch his movements.

15:02.032 --> 15:03.868
Griffith trusts him
with the money.

15:04.002 --> 15:06.505
Turns out Goodall
doesn't trust banks.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.377
Swap the real money
for this fake,

15:12.509 --> 15:15.279
then prove yourself a man
of acute perception

15:15.414 --> 15:17.348
in front of the right people.

15:17.482 --> 15:18.882
So, you want me
to give it some front

15:19.017 --> 15:22.353
and hope they're impressed?
What if that doesn't work?

15:22.487 --> 15:24.289
You'll be dead.

15:24.421 --> 15:26.490
So, when do you want me
to do this?

15:26.623 --> 15:29.393
Fight's tomorrow, so right now.

15:40.339 --> 15:41.640
Keep your phone on you.

15:41.772 --> 15:43.340
we can use it as a microphone
and tracker,

15:43.474 --> 15:45.610
so get as close as you can
to the people involved.

15:45.743 --> 15:48.046
We'll know where you are
even when you don't.

15:48.179 --> 15:50.115
You're on your own from here on.

15:51.315 --> 15:52.783
So what's new?

15:55.119 --> 15:58.355
Only report back
when you have hard evidence.

15:58.488 --> 16:01.124
Something that thus far we've
found difficult to acquire.

16:01.258 --> 16:05.062
We want the man at the top,
nothing less, do you understand?

17:19.703 --> 17:21.005
(shouting)

17:46.963 --> 17:51.869
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck?

17:52.004 --> 17:54.139
- He's ripped me off.
- He's lying.

17:54.271 --> 17:55.739
Check his pockets.

17:55.873 --> 17:58.643
I never seen that cunt before.
Don't fucking listen to him.

18:00.178 --> 18:02.046
- What the fuck?
- Shut up!

18:03.113 --> 18:05.717
MICHAEL: So... Check it.

18:05.851 --> 18:09.020
You see the thing is,
I don't know who you are.

18:09.153 --> 18:10.654
I'm trying to do you
a fucking favor.

18:10.788 --> 18:12.757
You're fucking wasting my time.
These look fine to me.

18:12.890 --> 18:14.526
Yeah?
Then you're a cunt too, then.

18:14.659 --> 18:16.494
It doesn't matter if you win
or fucking lose,

18:16.628 --> 18:18.529
he's taking real money
and swapping it for fake.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.065
You sure about that, are you?

18:20.198 --> 18:21.332
Check the water markings.

18:21.466 --> 18:22.800
Those water-markings
make a pound sign.

18:22.933 --> 18:24.501
That note hasn't got
a pound sign.

18:24.635 --> 18:27.972
- MAN: I've never seen him...
- Shut up!

18:28.105 --> 18:32.544
Fucking hell, he's right and
all. You're in the shit, son!

18:32.677 --> 18:34.512
- MAN: He's lying.
- It's alright, let him go.

18:34.645 --> 18:36.947
- MAN: Please, I swear!
- Let him go.

18:39.317 --> 18:41.518
- (man screams)
- What's your name?

18:41.651 --> 18:43.287
Word gets about, mate.

18:43.421 --> 18:46.792
Michael Clarke, that's who I am
and you lot are fucking mugs.

18:50.461 --> 18:52.430
Alright. Let him go.

18:55.799 --> 18:58.802
(knocking at door)

18:58.936 --> 19:01.606
(knocking at door)

19:01.739 --> 19:03.741
(banging on door)

19:03.874 --> 19:06.077
Here we go.

19:10.815 --> 19:12.717
- Michael Clarke.
- Who's asking?

19:12.850 --> 19:14.886
Do you know who I am?

19:15.019 --> 19:16.520
Jehovah's Witnesses?

19:16.653 --> 19:18.823
(chuckles)

19:18.956 --> 19:20.792
Funny cunt, ain't he?

19:24.261 --> 19:25.529
This your wife?

19:25.662 --> 19:27.632
Yeah.

19:27.765 --> 19:30.267
- Sorry to hear.
- Really?

19:30.401 --> 19:32.437
I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

19:32.569 --> 19:35.472
What, marriage?

19:35.606 --> 19:39.710
Well, it's good to see you kept
your sense of humor. Tragic.

19:39.844 --> 19:42.613
- Like his dress sense, eh?
- MAN 2: Hmm.

19:42.747 --> 19:45.517
Come on,
I'll sort you out. I'm buying.

19:45.650 --> 19:47.552
Come on, mate, get up.

19:53.658 --> 19:57.228
So, not a cop anymore?

19:57.361 --> 20:01.098
No, but I'm guessing
you already knew that.

20:01.231 --> 20:02.767
So, what are you doing now,
then?

20:02.901 --> 20:05.103
Other than being an ex-con
who likes a row.

20:06.571 --> 20:08.039
You could say that.

20:10.307 --> 20:12.676
- I might have something for you.
- Oh, yeah, like what?

20:12.811 --> 20:14.312
Not strictly legal.

20:14.446 --> 20:16.715
Don't know if you've heard but
I don't strictly give a fuck.

20:16.847 --> 20:19.383
Well, I gathered that.

20:19.517 --> 20:23.153
I was talking to a few boys
from my old firm.

20:23.287 --> 20:25.088
You like a ruck on the terraces,
don't you?

20:25.222 --> 20:29.192
What was it?
"Hooligan in a uniform."

20:29.326 --> 20:32.063
Look, I could use a bloke
like you, know what I mean?

20:32.197 --> 20:34.632
Someone who's no stranger
to crime, so to speak.

20:34.765 --> 20:37.835
I've got no love for the pigs,
mate, not anymore.

20:39.203 --> 20:41.272
Except for these ones,
of course.

20:46.210 --> 20:48.279
Your wife was Polish,
wasn't she?

20:50.081 --> 20:51.983
- Yeah.
- Speak a bit?

20:52.115 --> 20:53.517
A bit.

20:53.651 --> 20:55.187
You still wear the band?

20:56.921 --> 20:58.422
You gonna sit here and flirt
all morning

20:58.555 --> 21:00.257
or are you gonna tell me
what the fuck you want?

21:00.391 --> 21:02.893
Earn a crust,
live on a little bit more

21:03.026 --> 21:05.796
than that Job Seeker's Allowance
you're getting at the moment.

21:05.930 --> 21:07.331
I've checked your postbox.

21:07.465 --> 21:10.368
You don't look like a bloke
who's got any savings

21:10.500 --> 21:12.103
or a future.

21:12.236 --> 21:14.372
You ain't even got
that shit pension

21:14.505 --> 21:16.841
and a thank-you and a fuck-off
from the Met now, have you?

21:16.975 --> 21:19.244
Hmm?

21:19.376 --> 21:21.945
All you've got is a parole board

21:22.080 --> 21:24.749
up your arse
for the next three years.

21:24.882 --> 21:29.821
I'm offering you a job.
Cash in hand, though.

21:29.955 --> 21:34.459
- "No income tax, no VAT."
- "No money back, no guarantee."

21:34.593 --> 21:38.763
Come on!
What are you gonna be doing?

21:38.895 --> 21:40.931
Security?

21:41.065 --> 21:44.935
You do that for a week,
you'll get bored.

21:45.069 --> 21:47.137
Drink your tea
and I'll show you.

21:47.270 --> 21:48.772
You sound like my mother.

21:48.907 --> 21:53.545
Oh, funny you should say that,
that's how I got your address.

21:54.711 --> 21:57.548
(muffled shouting)

22:01.986 --> 22:04.022
Right, now you're gonna tell us

22:04.154 --> 22:06.023
what you've done
with our shipment.

22:07.557 --> 22:10.960
- Gavin. Michael Clarke.
- Charmed.

22:11.094 --> 22:15.732
MAN: Let me out! I didn't trust
those other guys you sent along.

22:15.866 --> 22:17.034
I didn't feel right about it.

22:17.168 --> 22:19.704
Well, that wasn't your call
to make, was it?

22:19.836 --> 22:23.775
Plus you fob us off
with pony currency.

22:23.908 --> 22:26.044
There's a lot of that about
at the moment,

22:26.177 --> 22:30.113
and you're putting ideas
in the girls' heads,

22:30.248 --> 22:31.982
ideas above their station.

22:32.115 --> 22:35.251
Now, you know
how Uno is about that, OK?

22:35.385 --> 22:37.187
He likes everything
in its place.

22:37.321 --> 22:41.559
MAN: I'm sorry, I wanted to
show those girls a good time.

22:41.692 --> 22:43.794
Well, not with our drugs,
you don't.

22:43.928 --> 22:46.898
We need to keep our ventures
separate.

22:47.030 --> 22:50.733
Can't go getting
delusions of grandeur, mate,

22:50.867 --> 22:52.836
especially not
for a fucking woman.

22:52.969 --> 22:57.074
- (gunshots)
- MAN: Stop! Please! Please!

22:57.208 --> 23:01.012
Now, tell us
where you stashed the weed

23:01.145 --> 23:03.747
and we'll forget
all former transgressions.

23:03.881 --> 23:06.984
It's in the back of the white
Jag in the lock-up in Bow.

23:07.117 --> 23:09.319
- The yard?
- Yeah.

23:09.452 --> 23:11.288
So, what was the plan?

23:11.421 --> 23:15.293
Were you gonna sell it on,
make a profit?

23:15.426 --> 23:18.062
Honestly, I didn't think
that far ahead, I swear.

23:18.194 --> 23:22.732
You didn't have a plan and you
didn't think we'd find out?

23:22.866 --> 23:28.172
You gave up the info pretty
quickly. You know what they say.

23:29.472 --> 23:31.774
Loose lips sink ships.

23:31.909 --> 23:34.145
(gunshot, screaming)

23:36.213 --> 23:39.450
Alright, into the drink.

23:42.120 --> 23:43.755
- (sobs)
- Speaking of drink.

23:52.095 --> 23:55.632
- How much is there?
- A lot.

23:55.766 --> 23:57.901
Successful night, then, I'd say.

23:59.370 --> 24:00.437
So... Uno?

24:00.571 --> 24:04.676
Yeah, my old man,
he'll be well happy.

24:05.910 --> 24:10.080
Check it. If it's real,
it's yours.

24:10.213 --> 24:14.985
Cause for celebration.
Let's go and see my sister.

24:16.586 --> 24:18.789
(thudding music)

24:26.596 --> 24:27.798
WOMAN: New recruit?

24:27.931 --> 24:31.769
Well, he hopes.
Dad might not like him.

24:36.507 --> 24:38.475
Got any new girls for me yet?

24:38.609 --> 24:40.345
Still working on it.

24:49.754 --> 24:52.657
(groans)

24:52.790 --> 24:57.360
Michael Clarke.
Meet my sister, Karolina.

24:57.495 --> 25:01.466
- Nice to meet you.
- (groans) Fuck!

25:02.432 --> 25:04.767
(indistinct)

25:04.901 --> 25:07.403
Uno's downstairs.
He's with some new girl,

25:07.537 --> 25:11.075
but it didn't work out,
so I'd knock first.

25:20.383 --> 25:23.386
It's such a pity, she was nice.

25:23.519 --> 25:26.056
- They always struggle.
- (knocking at door)

25:26.190 --> 25:28.459
I don't like it
when they look at me.

25:28.592 --> 25:31.528
You heard me say it, didn't you?
"Don't look at me."

25:34.332 --> 25:36.568
Get somebody
to dispose of her, will you?

25:37.468 --> 25:39.304
Yes, come in.

25:45.276 --> 25:49.080
- How did Drake go?
- GRIFFITH: Yeah, dealt with.

25:52.115 --> 25:58.155
Yeah. This is Michael Clarke,
think he could be useful for us.

25:58.288 --> 26:01.358
And of what use could you be
to us, Mr. Clarke?

26:01.491 --> 26:03.360
Whatever you need.

26:03.495 --> 26:05.229
You're eager to please.

26:08.266 --> 26:10.133
So what do you know
about our operation?

26:10.267 --> 26:13.938
Not much, really.
I'm still trying to work it out.

26:14.071 --> 26:17.241
Do you wanna keep it that way
or do you want to join the club?

26:17.374 --> 26:19.309
Lots of members' benefits.

26:23.480 --> 26:29.086
Choose your answer carefully
because when you're in...

26:31.055 --> 26:32.422
...you're in.

26:37.061 --> 26:39.130
Now, with Mr. Drake gone,
we have an opening,

26:39.263 --> 26:42.333
so the timing would seem
somewhat serendipitous.

26:47.504 --> 26:50.275
Now, if you'll excuse me...

26:54.611 --> 26:57.547
...I'm going home.

26:57.681 --> 27:00.117
My evening
didn't turn out as planned.

27:05.355 --> 27:07.025
A word, Mr. Griffith.

27:16.432 --> 27:17.667
He's a good man.

27:17.802 --> 27:20.571
- Is he?
- He's got brains.

27:20.703 --> 27:22.739
Oh, yeah?

27:22.873 --> 27:25.442
Good. Sure?

27:25.575 --> 27:28.112
Yeah, pretty much.

27:28.245 --> 27:30.347
So, I'm gonna take
your word for it, am I?

27:30.480 --> 27:32.916
You're gonna vouch for him,
are you?

27:34.617 --> 27:37.387
Yeah, yeah.

27:39.190 --> 27:41.292
So, what's he do?

27:43.393 --> 27:46.463
Well, he was a copper. But
he's been thrown out for GBH.

27:46.597 --> 27:47.998
- A copper?
- Yeah.

27:48.132 --> 27:50.368
Are you out
of your tiny fucking mind?

27:50.500 --> 27:55.506
Do you remember that "hooligan
in a uniform"? Well, that's him.

27:55.639 --> 27:58.175
So, how the fuck
can we trust him, then?

27:58.308 --> 28:02.479
I'll sort it.
I'll look after him.

28:02.613 --> 28:05.548
You better, 'cause if you don't,

28:05.682 --> 28:07.218
I'll cut your balls off
and feed them to you

28:07.351 --> 28:09.320
like I did to that nice
young Romanian gentleman.

28:09.453 --> 28:11.387
- Do you remember that one?
- Yeah, I remember.

28:11.521 --> 28:15.592
Yeah, keep that one in mind.
Ta-ra.

28:35.313 --> 28:38.614
Right, then, give us your phone.
Phone.

28:38.748 --> 28:41.585
Stop fucking about. Jesus.

28:45.421 --> 28:46.790
Here you go.

28:46.923 --> 28:48.859
Right, then,
I'll give you a bell tomorrow,

28:48.992 --> 28:52.462
make sure you're available,
alright? Oh.

28:52.595 --> 28:54.731
And this used to be Drake's.

28:54.864 --> 28:57.468
But he won't be needing it
anymore, will he?

28:59.903 --> 29:01.571
See you tomorrow.

29:16.754 --> 29:18.890
You boys don't give up, do you?

29:24.027 --> 29:25.963
Nice and calm.

29:33.903 --> 29:35.073
Welcome back, Mr. Clarke.

29:38.475 --> 29:41.679
Mr. Griffith is reputed
to have a good sense for people,

29:41.813 --> 29:45.016
but I like to see for myself.

29:45.149 --> 29:47.919
Judge a person's true colors
with my own eyes.

29:49.853 --> 29:51.622
Are you a policeman?

29:52.690 --> 29:53.791
(gasps)

29:55.426 --> 29:57.528
See, perhaps you're operating
under the assumption

29:57.661 --> 29:59.363
that you've got nothing to lose.

30:01.832 --> 30:03.834
And therefore
being brash and courageous

30:03.967 --> 30:06.336
would suit such a circumstance.

30:06.470 --> 30:07.872
But no.

30:08.738 --> 30:10.741
Most people,

30:10.874 --> 30:13.544
even those who think
they have nothing...

30:15.345 --> 30:19.049
...always have some little thing
they're holding on to.

30:21.585 --> 30:24.021
Unless they truly are insane.

30:25.523 --> 30:28.726
You strike me as being
of sound mind, Mr. Clarke...

30:30.728 --> 30:33.531
...so allow me to elucidate
the point.

30:35.665 --> 30:39.169
Your wife died.
This much we know.

30:40.437 --> 30:41.671
Terrible, tragic accident,

30:41.805 --> 30:44.042
perhaps putting you
into a downward spiral.

30:47.111 --> 30:49.247
That much I would understand.

30:51.248 --> 30:56.386
Pain will change a man,
but do you have nothing to lose?

30:57.921 --> 31:00.490
What about your mother,
your sister?

31:00.623 --> 31:06.064
Two very good reasons to live...
and much to lose.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.766
Especially if splayed out
in front of you

31:09.900 --> 31:13.371
with their skin taken off.

31:13.504 --> 31:18.942
So, I ask you again, because I
need to be sure I can trust you,

31:19.075 --> 31:21.044
are you a policeman?

31:21.178 --> 31:22.213
I'm not, I swear.

31:22.345 --> 31:24.547
On your mother's life?

31:24.681 --> 31:26.983
I swear.

31:29.853 --> 31:31.189
Welcome aboard, Mr. Clarke.

31:31.855 --> 31:33.790
Let him down.

31:46.069 --> 31:47.503
I've told
some of my new recruits

31:47.638 --> 31:50.807
that their hooligan credentials
would be in serious question

31:50.940 --> 31:53.710
if they didn't take advantage
of this opportunity.

31:55.546 --> 31:58.315
This way, we can see
if you're worth holding on to.

32:11.929 --> 32:14.431
MICHAEL: Fucking hell,
how old are you boys?

32:14.565 --> 32:16.167
Shouldn't you be at home
doing your homework?

32:16.299 --> 32:18.268
Good one, old man.
See how funny you think you are

32:18.401 --> 32:20.638
when I shove
this bat up your arse. (groans)

32:22.972 --> 32:26.143
Do yourself a favor
and fuck off.

32:33.083 --> 32:34.285
(coughs)

32:43.427 --> 32:46.329
- So...
- What are you doing here?

32:46.462 --> 32:50.733
We need to know
what you know now.

32:50.867 --> 32:52.936
They're gonna kill my
whole family for what I'm doing,

32:53.069 --> 32:55.905
- so I'm off to a flying start.
- What have you found?

32:56.038 --> 33:00.376
They've got quite a set-up.
Drugs, guns, protection.

33:00.510 --> 33:02.412
They've got a lot of muscle
as well.

33:02.546 --> 33:05.815
They've got set-ups all over
the place, they're everywhere.

33:05.949 --> 33:07.316
What about the women?

33:07.450 --> 33:11.020
Nothing like that yet.
I've got a feeling it's coming.

33:11.154 --> 33:13.489
I'm already completely fucked,
I'm exhausted.

33:13.623 --> 33:14.825
(phone)

33:16.826 --> 33:18.328
Answer it.

33:23.334 --> 33:25.769
- GRIFFITH: <i>Clarke?</i>
- Yeah?

33:25.902 --> 33:27.171
<i>I need you with me tonight.</i>

33:27.304 --> 33:28.772
<i>We're having trouble
with these cunts.</i>

33:28.904 --> 33:30.806
<i>I've got a job before
the next shipment comes in,</i>

33:30.940 --> 33:31.975
<i>then I'll grab you at ten.</i>

33:32.109 --> 33:33.443
<i>Make sure you're ready,
alright?</i>

33:33.576 --> 33:35.112
Yeah, no worries, mate,
I'll be there.

33:35.246 --> 33:36.847
<i>OK.</i>

33:38.148 --> 33:40.217
Figure out a way to get
what we need, Clarke,

33:40.350 --> 33:42.920
or we'll all be out
of our fucking jobs soon enough.

33:47.091 --> 33:48.725
MICHAEL:
What does he expect me to do?

33:48.859 --> 33:50.727
Bring Terence Turner down
in a few hours?

33:50.861 --> 33:52.262
I think he's taken
quite a lot of shit

33:52.395 --> 33:54.130
for choosing you for this.

33:56.999 --> 33:58.868
Now, we're setting up
a new safe house.

33:59.003 --> 34:01.405
We'll meet there next time.
It's not safe for us to meet...

34:01.538 --> 34:05.008
- Well, when I say "us," I mean...
- I know what you mean.

34:09.312 --> 34:12.148
You're not doing this
on your own, you know.

34:12.281 --> 34:16.585
I'm sorry I can't be there
with you but I failed.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.489
You didn't fail.

34:18.621 --> 34:21.056
That depends on who you talk to.

34:21.190 --> 34:23.259
I just wanted to help
those women.

34:23.393 --> 34:25.262
Yeah, well,
fuck what anyone else thinks.

34:25.395 --> 34:28.598
They weren't there, were they?
They weren't in that situation.

34:30.232 --> 34:33.603
Just be careful, if you can.

34:33.735 --> 34:35.670
Did you go for your medical?

34:35.806 --> 34:41.777
Yeah. Two fractured ribs and a
bruised hip, had a few x-rays.

34:41.911 --> 34:43.612
Gotta go back in a couple
of days for some more.

34:43.746 --> 34:45.982
You know, if you ever need me,

34:46.116 --> 34:49.118
you got my number,
you know where I am.

34:49.252 --> 34:52.389
Clarke, I've been listening in
all fucking night.

34:54.924 --> 34:56.292
What about that?

34:56.426 --> 34:59.930
(chuckles) It's a birth mark.

35:00.062 --> 35:03.667
Oh, sorry! It's quite cute.

35:05.102 --> 35:06.603
Fuck off.

35:10.875 --> 35:13.743
Alright? Michael Clarke, Andy,
Andy, Clarkey.

35:13.877 --> 35:16.547
Come on, you can eat that
in there. Go on.

35:19.049 --> 35:20.483
MICHAEL:
<i>Who the fuck are you, then?</i>

35:20.616 --> 35:22.452
ANDY: <i>I should ask you
the same fucking question.</i>

35:22.585 --> 35:25.020
Gun for hire, mate,
that's all you need to know.

35:25.154 --> 35:26.524
Get paid, fuck off.

35:26.656 --> 35:28.792
Fair enough, as long as you know
what you're doing.

35:28.926 --> 35:31.194
Yeah, simple enough. Give us
your phone. I'll show you.

35:31.328 --> 35:32.762
What? Why?

35:32.895 --> 35:35.365
Give us your phone, you fucking
fanny. I'll give it back to you.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.203
Right...

35:49.078 --> 35:50.946
- (phone rings)
- That's fucking impressive.

35:51.080 --> 35:52.849
'Ere, pass me that foil.

36:01.257 --> 36:02.960
(ringing stops)

36:08.631 --> 36:10.700
- Shit.
- What?

36:10.834 --> 36:12.435
We've lost the signal.

36:19.241 --> 36:21.812
Blocks the signal.
It's called a Faraday cage.

36:21.944 --> 36:23.013
How's that work, then?

36:23.147 --> 36:25.181
Well, the metal blocks
the signal.

36:25.314 --> 36:27.683
Apparently, those sneaky cunts
have been escaping,

36:27.817 --> 36:30.787
getting help from the outside,
hiding fucking phones...

36:30.921 --> 36:34.558
(whistles) ...up their arses and
Uno's not very happy about it,

36:34.690 --> 36:36.593
so we sorted him out some cable

36:36.725 --> 36:39.595
so he can build his own Faraday
cage, only much bigger,

36:39.730 --> 36:43.333
so he can control the signals
and keep his people in check.

36:43.466 --> 36:44.868
So they can't use their phones.

36:45.002 --> 36:47.571
Well, not while they're working
in this room for Uno, no.

36:47.703 --> 36:49.573
Imagine this room
covered in foil,

36:49.705 --> 36:53.709
only not foil, cable lattice.
Works both ways, and all.

36:53.843 --> 36:56.712
You want to keep info secure,
you can do that too.

36:56.846 --> 36:59.948
The boss man must be paranoid
enough to make sure

37:00.082 --> 37:02.552
no fucker wants to Facebook
his bum-chum on the outside

37:02.685 --> 37:05.588
or leave a trail
full of digital breadcrumbs.

37:05.723 --> 37:08.859
How much fucking cable
are you gonna need for that?

37:08.991 --> 37:11.093
That, my friend, is why they pay
me the big bucks.

37:11.227 --> 37:13.663
I had a measure-up yesterday.
We need about six miles.

37:13.797 --> 37:15.799
Six miles?

37:15.931 --> 37:18.100
Fuck.

37:18.234 --> 37:20.136
What has he got them
doing in there, anyway?

37:20.270 --> 37:22.172
You'll find out soon enough.

37:58.375 --> 38:00.410
You know
how to use one of these?

38:00.542 --> 38:01.945
I think so.

38:03.814 --> 38:05.515
I'll take that as a yes, then.

38:05.649 --> 38:09.853
Oh... Can you monitor
the police frequency?

38:09.986 --> 38:12.288
Cut through all that fucking
bollocks they speak, yeah?

38:12.422 --> 38:17.194
- You got it, then?
- Here you go. Hey, presto.

38:17.326 --> 38:20.062
You alright? You good, yeah?

38:20.196 --> 38:23.866
Go on. Do a scan, off you go.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.036
Oi, you see anything,
get back to me quick, alright?

38:28.171 --> 38:31.542
Why couldn't we just buy it,
Andy?

38:31.674 --> 38:34.143
If you've got a spare 700 grand,
then fair enough.

38:34.277 --> 38:36.747
You want no questions asked,
then this is the best method.

38:39.681 --> 38:41.484
(radio crackles)

38:45.055 --> 38:48.192
RADIO: <i>Silent alarm activated
at Longshore Industrial Park.</i>

38:48.325 --> 38:50.093
<i>I need a unit there
immediately.</i>

38:50.227 --> 38:51.929
MICHAEL: Fuck.

38:58.301 --> 39:01.738
- How long's this gonna take?
- As long as it takes.

39:01.872 --> 39:05.808
All night, then. I got
a good consignment on its way.

39:05.942 --> 39:09.446
I thought you enjoyed getting
your pick of the litter.

39:09.580 --> 39:13.450
Yeah, more than this shit,
anyway.

39:48.283 --> 39:50.319
Now, if you don't want a bullet
in the back of the head,

39:50.453 --> 39:53.223
I suggest you stay still.

39:53.355 --> 39:56.459
- Where's your partner?
- Still in the car.

39:56.593 --> 39:58.761
Don't do anything stupid.

39:58.895 --> 40:00.463
There are some
very serious people here

40:00.596 --> 40:02.631
who would not think twice
about putting a hole in you.

40:02.765 --> 40:03.866
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.102
- You got a family?
- Yes, I have.

40:06.236 --> 40:08.404
- Well, think about them.
- Please.

40:08.538 --> 40:11.174
Listen, go back to your vehicle,

40:11.308 --> 40:14.611
you speak to your partner,
you give them the all-clear.

40:14.743 --> 40:19.216
You radio in that all-clear.
I'll be listening.

40:19.348 --> 40:22.719
Then you drive away,
do you understand me?

40:23.754 --> 40:26.323
Tonight is your lucky night,
mate.

40:26.455 --> 40:28.524
I've got your badge number.

40:33.395 --> 40:35.531
Don't turn around!

40:41.971 --> 40:45.174
ANDY: <i>I mean, half the time,
it ain't bad.</i>

40:45.308 --> 40:48.745
- What are they doing?
- I don't know.

40:48.879 --> 40:51.915
They interfere every time,
don't they?

40:52.047 --> 40:55.252
- You a footie man?
- Yes, mate.

40:55.384 --> 40:58.254
- Well, what team?
- I'm Luton Town, mate.

40:58.388 --> 41:01.290
Fuck me! You are
a glutton for punishment.

41:01.424 --> 41:04.128
<i>Drop me out at The Nag's Head.
I'll walk from there.</i>

41:15.004 --> 41:18.875
Homely, innit?
Rather them than me.

41:22.279 --> 41:26.850
This room's already complete.
We're doing more.

41:26.982 --> 41:28.818
These sneaky bastards
from Eastern Europe

41:28.951 --> 41:32.122
have no end of inventive ways
to escape.

41:32.254 --> 41:34.624
Or at the very least,
send word out.

41:36.259 --> 41:39.429
We can't have that, can we?

41:39.562 --> 41:42.898
- Control.
- That's it.

41:43.031 --> 41:45.568
Control the signals,
control the workforce.

41:45.701 --> 41:48.071
Stop them calling for help.

41:48.203 --> 41:51.807
Security will be like
a fucking sieve otherwise.

41:51.942 --> 41:53.744
Can't get the staff.

41:53.877 --> 41:55.545
All they gotta do is pack up
a load of drugs.

41:55.678 --> 41:59.015
Can't be that fucking hard,
can it?

41:59.147 --> 42:03.886
Get ideas, though, don't they?
Give them an inch.

42:04.020 --> 42:07.190
Fucking rats! They're only here
a couple of days,

42:07.323 --> 42:09.058
but, fuck me,
do they stink the place up.

42:09.192 --> 42:11.027
Takes the clean-up crew
a whole fucking day

42:11.160 --> 42:14.497
to clean the stink
off the walls.

42:14.631 --> 42:17.433
Just in time
for the next lot to arrive.

42:21.703 --> 42:24.475
GRIFFITH: Oi, come on.

42:35.951 --> 42:39.723
Do not try to run
or they will kill you.

42:40.991 --> 42:43.093
Welcome to England.

42:49.866 --> 42:54.804
Wake up. You, up. Now! Up!

42:55.504 --> 42:57.740
- (screaming)
- Shut up!

43:03.312 --> 43:05.114
Out.

43:05.247 --> 43:07.483
(dogs bark)

43:08.585 --> 43:10.187
Come on!

43:11.353 --> 43:13.357
Get the fuck out now!

43:41.151 --> 43:43.786
(indistinct speech)

44:17.453 --> 44:21.823
Boys, good to see you.
About time you showed up.

44:21.957 --> 44:23.625
I've been waiting long enough.

44:23.759 --> 44:29.198
Uno's not a patient man,
and time is money.

44:29.332 --> 44:31.767
I trust you picked
the best ones, Gav?

44:32.634 --> 44:34.036
GAVIN: Certainly did.

44:35.171 --> 44:39.343
You lot are mine now.

44:40.743 --> 44:44.513
Do as I say
and everything will be OK.

44:44.647 --> 44:45.848
(whispers)

44:45.982 --> 44:48.718
Did I ask you
to fucking speak Polish?

44:48.850 --> 44:51.921
You're in England now.

44:52.654 --> 44:57.393
En-ger-land.

45:05.167 --> 45:06.502
Yes?

45:08.937 --> 45:10.673
Yes?

45:31.660 --> 45:32.929
Come on.

45:43.839 --> 45:50.046
Good choice, Gav.
This one's fucking hot.

46:07.529 --> 46:11.000
Right, onto the next.

46:14.736 --> 46:16.005
Maybe she ain't
cut out for this.

46:16.138 --> 46:17.573
Can't you give her another job?

46:17.707 --> 46:19.209
KAROLINA:
Who the fuck asked you?

46:25.381 --> 46:26.950
(chokes)

46:30.585 --> 46:32.388
(choking)

46:37.828 --> 46:39.329
(gasps)

47:26.075 --> 47:29.812
GAVIN: I can see you've got
this under control.

47:29.946 --> 47:34.351
Yes. You can go now.
Cheers for the support.

47:37.185 --> 47:43.492
Be good, yeah? Let me know
when these lot are ready.

47:44.428 --> 47:46.797
I'll be back to test
a few later.

47:47.897 --> 47:49.565
Will do.

47:51.201 --> 47:53.937
Right, let's go
to the old lounge.

47:54.069 --> 47:57.207
Trip down memory lane
for you, old man.

47:57.339 --> 47:58.908
Fuck off.

48:22.431 --> 48:24.301
To me, firstly.

48:26.301 --> 48:28.370
I'm off tomorrow.

48:30.607 --> 48:32.442
Nice little recruit.

48:33.808 --> 48:36.645
Some fresh meat, new girls.

48:36.779 --> 48:39.815
None of this back-of-the-truck
shit like earlier.

48:39.948 --> 48:41.851
Good earners.

48:44.386 --> 48:47.756
Here's to the fucking morons
who come of their own free will.

48:48.323 --> 48:50.559
Free will?

48:50.694 --> 48:51.995
You don't know, do you?

48:52.127 --> 48:53.763
What?

48:57.267 --> 48:59.835
My niche, my little sideline.

49:02.004 --> 49:05.975
He gets women to think
they're in love with them

49:06.109 --> 49:09.045
and then he invites them
to meet the family,

49:09.178 --> 49:13.415
which, of course, is us.
And the special ones...

49:13.549 --> 49:15.584
That's how they make
their money.

49:16.886 --> 49:19.389
Rich Americans, rich Arabs,

49:19.522 --> 49:23.959
anyone with enough
to buy and sell human beings.

49:24.093 --> 49:26.196
"Will you marry me?

49:27.629 --> 49:30.399
I'd love you
to come and meet my mother.

49:31.468 --> 49:32.969
She'd really like you."

49:33.102 --> 49:35.003
Seen enough get away, though.

49:35.138 --> 49:41.143
Two... that got away, actually.
Only two.

49:41.277 --> 49:44.680
One of them didn't
really get away, did she?

49:44.814 --> 49:46.683
Tatiana.

49:49.718 --> 49:50.886
Who was the other one?

49:51.020 --> 49:53.690
Oh, yeah.

49:54.690 --> 49:57.560
Now, she was outrageous.

49:57.692 --> 50:00.595
Here, let me show you.

50:00.730 --> 50:03.967
See, imagine they were sitting
over there at that bar there.

50:05.701 --> 50:07.502
She'll be sitting there, yeah,

50:07.636 --> 50:12.007
looking all lonely, looking
for someone, looking for me.

50:14.477 --> 50:16.745
Soon as they smile, I got 'em.

50:19.482 --> 50:24.087
I just give them
some compliments, reassurance.

50:27.022 --> 50:29.825
Maybe a bit of chemical help,
sometimes, you know...

50:33.161 --> 50:39.835
Slip them something,
make them more... suggestible.

50:43.571 --> 50:46.075
I didn't think she'd give me any
trouble so I shipped her off.

50:46.209 --> 50:49.812
But then back in that same town,
different bar...

50:51.547 --> 50:54.015
...I bumped
into another young lady.

50:54.149 --> 51:00.923
Girl with a... cute little
birthmark just under her jaw.

51:03.593 --> 51:07.797
Looked a bit lonely, you know,
bit out of place...

51:10.198 --> 51:12.501
Begging for it, in other words.

51:17.540 --> 51:19.209
Spoke a bit of English,
been studying it,

51:19.341 --> 51:20.642
wanted to move over here.

51:20.776 --> 51:22.678
But by that point,
I was on a roll.

51:22.812 --> 51:24.147
It was a bit of a no-brainer.

51:24.279 --> 51:29.417
I mean, at the end of the day,
a mouth's a mouth.

51:29.551 --> 51:31.955
Am I right, gents?

51:33.388 --> 51:34.856
I got her down to the port,

51:34.989 --> 51:39.129
loaded her into the container,
gave the custom boys a nod.

51:41.897 --> 51:44.500
Maybe it was the sight of the
other unconscious girl in there

51:44.634 --> 51:47.102
that put her off.

51:47.236 --> 51:48.371
Maybe she didn't much like

51:48.504 --> 51:51.806
my English welcome
when we got to port.

51:51.940 --> 51:55.477
Maybe I miscalculated
the dose of the drugs,

51:55.611 --> 51:57.314
got there too late.

51:59.848 --> 52:06.088
Even so, I had them both
to myself for a few hours

52:06.221 --> 52:09.526
before handing them over to sis.

52:11.694 --> 52:13.763
I thought I'd have some fun.

52:13.895 --> 52:15.464
(women weeping)

52:16.631 --> 52:19.368
No sloppy seconds for me.

52:19.502 --> 52:22.105
(tuts)

52:24.006 --> 52:27.676
These girls were
gonna get fucked so hard.

52:30.779 --> 52:32.315
GAVIN: Fuck!

52:36.285 --> 52:40.455
Alright, alright! Get the fuck
out of it. Go on, fuck off!

52:40.589 --> 52:43.359
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

52:44.993 --> 52:47.363
Do you know who I am?

52:47.497 --> 52:49.399
I'm the fucking boss's son

52:49.531 --> 52:51.500
and I'm gonna fucking kill you!

52:53.968 --> 52:56.038
Oi, Clarkey!

52:58.274 --> 52:59.808
I'll talk to the boss,

52:59.942 --> 53:02.544
say you drank too much
and leave it at that.

53:02.678 --> 53:05.213
Probably best to take
tomorrow off, though, right?

53:05.346 --> 53:06.882
I shouldn't have done that.

53:07.015 --> 53:10.152
Well, he's a horrible little
prick, ain't he?

53:10.285 --> 53:13.822
Now go straight home. Don't do
anything stupid, alright?

53:16.826 --> 53:21.064
Fucking hell! Fuck!

53:57.933 --> 54:00.035
This is Malina.

54:00.169 --> 54:03.239
I don't want to know
her fucking name.

54:12.848 --> 54:14.651
Good choice, though.

54:17.620 --> 54:18.654
Go on, you can fuck off now.

54:18.786 --> 54:20.555
I'll let you know
when we're done.

54:20.689 --> 54:22.225
Yes, sir.

54:33.902 --> 54:35.605
Well, let's see you, then.

54:42.879 --> 54:44.948
It's shit being me.

55:06.335 --> 55:08.904
You ready to get fucked,
little lady?

55:13.209 --> 55:15.277
Nice and agreeable, huh?

55:28.190 --> 55:31.928
Did Karolina
tell you what to do?

55:36.232 --> 55:38.768
Tell you what would happen
if you didn't?

55:40.969 --> 55:42.437
Huh?

55:44.872 --> 55:46.508
Y-Yes.

55:51.413 --> 55:53.482
Good girl.

56:16.772 --> 56:20.276
I take it you slipped your phone
in his pocket or something?

56:20.408 --> 56:22.377
Yeah.

56:22.511 --> 56:25.815
I haven't quite figured out
how I'm gonna get it back yet.

56:25.948 --> 56:27.850
Nice move, though.

56:27.982 --> 56:30.419
At least we'll know where
he'll be at certain times.

56:30.553 --> 56:32.254
It's more than we knew before.

56:32.386 --> 56:33.689
What's this?

56:33.823 --> 56:36.091
This is where you've been
the past few days,

56:36.225 --> 56:38.060
where and when
we lost your signal,

56:38.194 --> 56:40.596
so we know where
to look for your corpse.

56:42.064 --> 56:45.234
It's like you said.
Their operation is sprawling,

56:45.368 --> 56:46.768
different locales
all over the place.

56:46.902 --> 56:49.005
It's very difficult
to keep track.

56:51.774 --> 56:53.710
(Malina sobs)

56:53.843 --> 56:58.413
GAVIN: <i>Stop crying.
Stop fucking crying.</i>

56:58.547 --> 56:59.948
<i>Stop crying...</i>

57:00.082 --> 57:03.018
Tell me why we don't just go
and arrest him right now.

57:03.152 --> 57:05.755
We do that, we blow your cover,

57:05.888 --> 57:07.957
we lose a chance at getting
to Terence Turner

57:08.089 --> 57:10.660
and really making a difference.

57:15.230 --> 57:17.834
I'll call in a uniform,
domestic disturbance.

57:26.442 --> 57:28.444
I'll get them
to report back ASAP.

57:28.576 --> 57:33.149
They'll get there faster
than we would. Are you OK?

57:39.187 --> 57:40.922
You miss her.

57:43.192 --> 57:45.027
Every day.

57:45.160 --> 57:47.796
We don't have to
if you don't want...

57:47.930 --> 57:49.464
MICHAEL: It's OK.

57:52.067 --> 57:55.036
I take it you heard
what happened,

57:55.171 --> 57:57.006
me at the cup game.

57:57.138 --> 57:59.307
It's alright, it's all over
the papers, I know.

57:59.442 --> 58:02.210
That was the night
she went into labor.

58:05.980 --> 58:08.917
And I was there
and not with her.

58:12.321 --> 58:14.790
By the time
I got to the hospital...

58:21.330 --> 58:24.165
They said there was nothing
I could do,

58:24.299 --> 58:29.537
it wasn't my fault,
and I don't blame them.

58:29.672 --> 58:32.675
'Cause I could quite easily
have been one of them

58:32.808 --> 58:34.277
if it wasn't for her.

58:36.946 --> 58:38.514
She hated it.

58:40.216 --> 58:41.718
I think...

58:45.254 --> 58:46.389
Maybe I...

58:47.857 --> 58:49.892
I think I'm making her proud.

58:51.527 --> 58:53.863
Now you get to make
a difference.

58:58.033 --> 58:59.701
She would have liked you.

59:01.169 --> 59:03.205
Someone who gives a shit.

59:11.814 --> 59:13.482
(phone rings)

59:18.152 --> 59:19.587
Hello.

59:19.721 --> 59:21.690
<i>Hello, Mr. Turner,
it's Matthew from front desk.</i>

59:21.823 --> 59:24.225
<i>Sorry to disturb you. I have a
police officer here who'd like</i>

59:24.359 --> 59:26.861
<i>to speak to you about a
disturbance in your apartment.</i>

59:26.995 --> 59:28.631
It's three
in the fucking morning.

59:28.763 --> 59:30.265
<i>I know, sir, I do apologize.</i>

59:30.399 --> 59:32.567
<i>He just wants to know
if you're alright.</i>

59:32.701 --> 59:34.170
Yeah, I'm fine.

59:34.303 --> 59:37.540
<i>He's being very insistent.
Can I send him up, please, sir?</i>

59:40.042 --> 59:42.411
Yes, just give me a minute,
alright?

59:50.585 --> 59:52.555
Oi!

59:52.687 --> 59:54.623
Go and hide in the bathroom.

59:56.225 --> 01:00:03.431
I hear a squeak from you,
I'll kill you, alright?

01:00:03.565 --> 01:00:05.067
OK.

01:00:16.678 --> 01:00:19.614
Ah, good evening. Mr. Turner?

01:00:19.748 --> 01:00:22.216
- How can I help?
- Officer Barrington.

01:00:22.350 --> 01:00:25.220
I would like to come and look
around, if that's OK with you.

01:00:26.555 --> 01:00:28.223
Thank you very much.

01:00:29.658 --> 01:00:31.027
That's a bit nasty.

01:00:41.069 --> 01:00:43.171
Mind if I ask
what this is about?

01:00:43.305 --> 01:00:46.875
There's been some reports
of a lady screaming.

01:00:47.009 --> 01:00:48.611
Screaming?

01:00:51.913 --> 01:00:57.953
Um, it's probably me.
I'm so sorry.

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.459
We'll shut the windows.

01:01:03.591 --> 01:01:04.893
OFFICER:
That's a very good idea.

01:01:05.027 --> 01:01:08.965
(no sound)

01:01:10.899 --> 01:01:12.868
GAVIN: Anything else
we can help you with?

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.805
OFFICER: No, I don't think so.
I think I've seen enough.

01:01:27.748 --> 01:01:31.585
Karolina told me
to do as I'm told.

01:01:31.719 --> 01:01:33.321
Shut up.

01:01:37.058 --> 01:01:39.660
BAKER:
Sounds like she's OK, for now.

01:01:39.794 --> 01:01:43.766
I'll get them to keep a car
there until the morning.

01:01:50.872 --> 01:01:55.678
We know about Gavin Turner.
His time will come.

01:01:57.212 --> 01:02:00.181
Anything that leads us
to Terence is...

01:02:00.314 --> 01:02:01.783
A priority.

01:02:03.518 --> 01:02:06.788
- I just wanna kill him.
- No.

01:02:06.922 --> 01:02:11.861
That'd be the easy way out
for him. Too quick.

01:02:16.665 --> 01:02:19.302
He had me in that container,
you know.

01:02:21.569 --> 01:02:27.943
<i>Tatiana, she... she managed
to break free and she ran.</i>

01:02:31.613 --> 01:02:33.181
<i>Without even thinking about it,</i>

01:02:33.314 --> 01:02:36.885
<i>he ran after her
to save himself embarrassment.</i>

01:02:41.156 --> 01:02:43.459
I managed to escape.

01:02:45.259 --> 01:02:47.196
<i>She's dead.</i>

01:02:51.232 --> 01:02:54.236
There were two other officers
before me, you know.

01:02:56.171 --> 01:02:59.274
Both missing, presumed dead.

01:03:02.511 --> 01:03:05.547
Hawkins had seen my file,

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:07.950
and saw that I could speak
some Polish,

01:03:08.082 --> 01:03:12.453
so that was it. That was
all the qualification I needed.

01:03:12.587 --> 01:03:15.157
That and my basic training.

01:03:17.591 --> 01:03:20.528
I wasn't prepared.

01:03:20.661 --> 01:03:22.964
Nothing can prepare you
for that.

01:03:52.361 --> 01:03:53.863
(clears throat)

01:03:58.966 --> 01:04:01.035
(buzzes)

01:04:01.169 --> 01:04:03.038
Fuck.

01:04:15.317 --> 01:04:17.920
(phone rings)

01:04:18.652 --> 01:04:20.055
Yeah.

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:23.924
<i>Uno's called us
to the Polish unit.</i>

01:04:24.058 --> 01:04:25.326
Alright.

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.763
<i>Be there in an hour.</i>

01:04:37.071 --> 01:04:39.073
(phone rings)

01:04:39.207 --> 01:04:40.542
MAN: <i>Yes, boss.</i>

01:04:40.674 --> 01:04:43.278
Can you tell me
where Clarke lives?

01:04:43.411 --> 01:04:45.848
<i>Yeah, I can get the address.</i>

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:48.616
Send it to me.
I need to pick him up.

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:50.486
<i>Yes, boss.</i>

01:04:58.093 --> 01:05:00.562
HAWKINS: Good sleep?

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:04.064
Where's Baker?

01:05:04.198 --> 01:05:07.769
HAWKINS: She's gone
for another medical check-up.

01:05:07.902 --> 01:05:11.607
- What time is it?
- Time you got cleaned up.

01:05:13.274 --> 01:05:16.077
Did Baker mention
the new operation?

01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:18.812
Nothing to do with me.

01:05:18.946 --> 01:05:21.182
Personally, I don't think
it'll work.

01:05:21.315 --> 01:05:23.285
We're all being reassigned.

01:05:23.417 --> 01:05:25.686
Reassigned?

01:05:25.821 --> 01:05:27.221
What do you mean, reassigned?

01:05:27.355 --> 01:05:29.257
Whatever the powers-that-be
are planning,

01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:30.593
it's bigger than you and I

01:05:30.725 --> 01:05:32.359
and if Uno
gets wind of what we're doing,

01:05:32.493 --> 01:05:34.028
he'll be gone overnight.

01:05:34.163 --> 01:05:36.865
Disappear without trace.

01:05:36.997 --> 01:05:40.802
It's happened before.
They relocate, regroup.

01:05:40.935 --> 01:05:43.370
And we have to start
all over again,

01:05:43.504 --> 01:05:45.406
and you'll be
in a box in the ground.

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:49.210
There's another undercover agent
providing intel.

01:05:49.343 --> 01:05:51.946
According to his superiors,
he's in deep,

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:55.616
so we just sit this one out,
I'm afraid.

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:57.886
And what am I
supposed to do now?

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.855
You don't have to like it.

01:06:00.989 --> 01:06:05.294
So that's it, we're just gonna
give up and walk away?

01:06:05.426 --> 01:06:07.863
I'll drop you back to your flat.

01:06:07.995 --> 01:06:10.631
Uniformed officers
will be along to arrest you

01:06:10.765 --> 01:06:12.366
to keep up appearances.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.535
Then you'll be held
in police custody,

01:06:14.669 --> 01:06:17.705
at least for a few weeks,
whilst arrests are made.

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:20.676
Assuming all goes well.

01:06:24.212 --> 01:06:26.782
I wanna see Baker.

01:06:26.915 --> 01:06:28.984
I'll let her know
where you'll be held.

01:06:42.330 --> 01:06:44.899
You and I are not finished,
little lady.

01:06:47.035 --> 01:06:50.172
Think you're a clever cunt?

01:06:50.305 --> 01:06:55.210
I'll deal with you later.
Don't go anywhere, yeah?

01:07:14.661 --> 01:07:16.431
Sneaky cunt.

01:07:19.167 --> 01:07:21.237
Who the fuck are you, then?

01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:28.042
GRIFFITH:
Whoa, living dangerously!

01:07:28.176 --> 01:07:30.078
Where you been?
I've been calling.

01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:32.547
Oh... Fucking battery died.

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:38.553
- You seen Gavin?
- Nah, you?

01:07:38.685 --> 01:07:41.556
Well, no, I wouldn't ask you
otherwise, would I?

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:47.329
We've been summoned.

01:07:47.462 --> 01:07:50.064
The boss man was impressed
with those girls,

01:07:50.198 --> 01:07:54.636
but some of the new workers
need a bit of discipline.

01:07:54.768 --> 01:07:57.906
Well, the cage is open,
and there's no calls going out,

01:07:58.038 --> 01:08:00.142
but we found
three of them with phones, so...

01:08:01.442 --> 01:08:04.613
We're gonna have to make
an example of one of them.

01:08:04.745 --> 01:08:07.848
You know, make sure the others
don't have any bright ideas.

01:08:07.982 --> 01:08:09.751
So, you up for that?

01:08:11.352 --> 01:08:14.555
- Yeah? Well, come, let's go.
- What, now?

01:08:14.689 --> 01:08:18.993
Yeah, now, and if you're lucky,
I'll let you pull the trigger.

01:08:36.812 --> 01:08:38.314
Gentlemen.

01:08:40.314 --> 01:08:43.050
<i>I recently acquired this car
lot from my Polish friends.</i>

01:08:43.184 --> 01:08:44.885
<i>Seems they thought
they could steal</i>

01:08:45.019 --> 01:08:47.255
<i>some of their own back from us.</i>

01:08:47.388 --> 01:08:50.591
Provide a cheap source of labor
for the place.

01:08:53.228 --> 01:08:54.796
They were wrong.

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:58.533
Nothing escapes me.

01:08:58.666 --> 01:09:03.071
You know why?
Attention to detail.

01:09:03.203 --> 01:09:07.343
It is the number-one rule in
running a successful business.

01:09:18.752 --> 01:09:22.991
<i>Do you... know that man there?</i>

01:09:26.327 --> 01:09:28.796
No, I don't.

01:09:32.533 --> 01:09:35.836
(turns water jet on,
Hawkins screams)

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:37.437
(turns water jet off,
screaming stops)

01:09:37.572 --> 01:09:40.408
GRIFFITH: <i>Get the fuck off me!
The fuck off me!</i>

01:09:40.541 --> 01:09:43.111
Alright, alright, just fucking
leave me. Fuck off!

01:09:43.243 --> 01:09:46.180
Now, I like to think
I'm a fair man.

01:09:46.313 --> 01:09:51.352
Proportional response is perhaps
a better way of looking at it.

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:57.392
That man there was a pig...

01:09:57.524 --> 01:10:00.995
Clarke is a pig.

01:10:04.299 --> 01:10:10.272
I do hate to say it, but you've
lost your touch, Griffith.

01:10:15.443 --> 01:10:17.746
Now, I do like to see a man
fight for his life,

01:10:17.879 --> 01:10:20.047
so which one of you would like
to step up to the challenge?

01:10:20.181 --> 01:10:22.884
Hmm?

01:10:23.017 --> 01:10:26.487
Fight and win, then perhaps
fight among yourselves.

01:10:26.621 --> 01:10:29.023
An opportunity
to kill each other.

01:10:29.157 --> 01:10:35.998
Fight and lose, and I will make
your death agony for months.

01:10:37.799 --> 01:10:43.037
<i>This man here,
one of your own fighters.</i>

01:10:44.473 --> 01:10:46.308
<i>He's gonna be my champion.</i>

01:10:47.942 --> 01:10:50.245
So, decide.

01:10:52.613 --> 01:10:55.683
Which one of you goes first?

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:59.254
I'll go first.

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:02.090
- You won't beat him.
- You wanna fucking bet?

01:11:02.224 --> 01:11:05.093
- Let me fight him.
- Just fuck off.

01:11:05.225 --> 01:11:08.996
I know him,
and when I've fucked him up,

01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:12.100
I'm gonna come back for you.

01:11:12.233 --> 01:11:14.102
Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off me!

01:11:21.675 --> 01:11:23.144
Whoo!

01:12:24.471 --> 01:12:26.474
Put the old dog
out of his misery.

01:12:38.886 --> 01:12:41.223
<i>I think I'll leave you
to Gavin.</i>

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:47.362
He's got more... creative ways
to deal with you.

01:12:55.502 --> 01:12:56.938
(gunshot)

01:12:59.907 --> 01:13:01.643
That fighter right there.

01:13:03.678 --> 01:13:05.580
Undercover pig.

01:13:05.712 --> 01:13:08.183
This is DI Baker 1493.

01:13:08.315 --> 01:13:11.251
Gunshots reported
on Eastern Way Industrial Area.

01:13:11.385 --> 01:13:14.055
Send immediate back-up
and deployment of SCO19.

01:13:14.188 --> 01:13:17.158
Officer en route. Approach
the area with extreme caution.

01:13:23.497 --> 01:13:25.634
You're in the shit now, mate.

01:13:31.171 --> 01:13:32.674
(grunts)

01:14:46.313 --> 01:14:48.349
Hello.

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:51.719
(gunshot, Baker groans)

01:15:01.662 --> 01:15:03.898
You're one of them too,
are you?

01:15:08.403 --> 01:15:11.206
I told you I'd fuck you.

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:15.210
Cover her up.

01:15:53.447 --> 01:15:55.049
(Baker gasps)

01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:01.822
Oh, my God.

01:16:03.456 --> 01:16:05.926
(panicked gasps)

01:16:10.297 --> 01:16:12.032
Fuck!

01:16:12.166 --> 01:16:14.069
OK...

01:16:46.733 --> 01:16:48.602
(groans)

01:16:51.206 --> 01:16:53.507
(winces)

01:17:02.082 --> 01:17:03.317
(gasps)

01:17:12.193 --> 01:17:14.763
KAROLINA: Long night
ahead of you, Clarkey.

01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:19.166
I've been practicing.

01:17:26.773 --> 01:17:29.544
There, all broken.

01:17:31.912 --> 01:17:35.716
Relax, Clarke. Look.

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:40.888
Just in case
she doesn't do it for you.

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:46.059
Question is, Clarke, which drug
is gonna wear off first?

01:17:46.193 --> 01:17:50.431
The Diazepam or the Viagra?

01:17:54.167 --> 01:17:55.769
(groans)

01:18:01.142 --> 01:18:05.246
We keep this one
for special occasions.

01:18:07.181 --> 01:18:10.417
Just in case
clients prove troublesome.

01:18:11.952 --> 01:18:14.921
She has something very special
she can give you.

01:18:15.055 --> 01:18:17.892
My three favorite letters.

01:18:18.024 --> 01:18:23.497
S, T and D.

01:18:26.867 --> 01:18:30.938
Oh, and not the curable kind,
either.

01:18:37.545 --> 01:18:39.314
Thank you, my darling.

01:18:48.288 --> 01:18:52.693
I see you've met my daughter.
Beautiful, isn't she?

01:18:52.827 --> 01:18:54.495
She's a lethal combination

01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:57.866
of her mother's arse
and my brains. (laughs)

01:19:00.468 --> 01:19:03.837
Oh, Michael, Michael, Michael,
let's have a look at you.

01:19:06.741 --> 01:19:08.542
BAKER: Where is he?

01:19:09.242 --> 01:19:12.713
- What?
- Clarke?

01:19:15.983 --> 01:19:17.684
How the fuck did that happen?

01:19:17.818 --> 01:19:20.621
Tell me where he is.

01:19:25.158 --> 01:19:27.127
(Gavin mutters)

01:19:29.997 --> 01:19:33.867
(screams) Fucking bitch!

01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:38.039
That's just one.

01:19:38.171 --> 01:19:39.306
(gunshot)

01:19:42.443 --> 01:19:45.179
Get up. Get up!

01:19:45.312 --> 01:19:46.781
(screams)

01:19:54.889 --> 01:19:56.690
Who's fucked now?

01:20:02.796 --> 01:20:06.433
You're a copper.
You're not gonna kill me.

01:20:10.604 --> 01:20:12.406
Where is he?

01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.774
They're at
the construction site.

01:20:14.908 --> 01:20:16.277
Where he drugged me.

01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:20.248
You're a clever fucking cunt.

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:23.385
(Gavin groans)

01:20:27.421 --> 01:20:32.660
He'll be long gone now.
Buried in concrete.

01:20:32.792 --> 01:20:35.129
Propping up
our next fucking enterprise.

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:38.198
What the fuck
is the matter with you?

01:20:38.331 --> 01:20:40.667
GAVIN: I think
they call it narcissism.

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:50.678
(Gavin groans)

01:20:58.986 --> 01:21:02.623
I think I may drug
you up some more.

01:21:03.791 --> 01:21:05.527
Sell you to the Russians.

01:21:07.595 --> 01:21:09.264
There we go.

01:21:10.764 --> 01:21:13.633
You know why, Michael?

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:19.541
Because you have been a very
naughty boy. Yes, you have.

01:21:21.709 --> 01:21:25.145
I'm building a new base
of operations here.

01:21:25.278 --> 01:21:27.982
In fact, that's why we are about
to go upstairs

01:21:28.114 --> 01:21:30.952
to the concrete pour.

01:21:31.085 --> 01:21:36.556
Oh, yes,
tying up the loose ends.

01:21:36.690 --> 01:21:40.661
All those dead bodies
submerged in concrete,

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:43.931
swallowed up by the grey ooze.

01:21:44.064 --> 01:21:46.366
All the history
of my past transgressions

01:21:46.501 --> 01:21:49.337
wiped out like that.

01:21:49.470 --> 01:21:54.341
I like to think the bones
of my enemies

01:21:54.474 --> 01:21:58.745
are truly propping up
my new business enterprise.

01:22:00.581 --> 01:22:02.449
See what I'm doing, Michael?

01:22:02.582 --> 01:22:05.018
I'm turning a negative
into a positive.

01:22:12.091 --> 01:22:13.795
Can you see?

01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:16.497
Look at her, Michael.

01:22:16.630 --> 01:22:22.336
Take a look at her. Oof!
God knows where she's been.

01:22:22.469 --> 01:22:27.007
Oh, come on, turn that frown
upside down, Mr. Clarke.

01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:28.876
Enjoy yourself.

01:23:12.219 --> 01:23:13.922
(distant voices)

01:23:17.224 --> 01:23:19.292
(yells)

01:23:19.426 --> 01:23:21.395
No!

01:23:28.135 --> 01:23:29.504
Die!

01:23:32.739 --> 01:23:33.840
(chokes)

01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:37.644
KAROLINA: Die!

01:23:43.216 --> 01:23:44.818
Die!

01:23:48.488 --> 01:23:49.623
(gunshot)

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:55.696
- What the fuck was that?
- I've got no idea.

01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:58.233
(Baker gasps)

01:24:00.733 --> 01:24:02.669
Stay there, stay down.

01:24:24.657 --> 01:24:25.725
(gunshot echoes)

01:24:25.859 --> 01:24:27.260
Sir, I've gotta get you
to safety.

01:24:27.394 --> 01:24:29.095
I'm surrounded by guards,
for fuck's sake.

01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:31.565
I'm safe enough.
Here, get us a cup of tea.

01:24:31.698 --> 01:24:33.733
Go on.

01:24:33.867 --> 01:24:35.703
(gunshot)

01:24:39.372 --> 01:24:41.643
Hurry the fuck up.

01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:51.151
(groans)

01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:24.285
(gunshot)

01:25:42.903 --> 01:25:44.405
(gunshot, man groans)

01:25:56.250 --> 01:25:58.886
Come on, for fuck's sake.

01:25:59.019 --> 01:26:01.889
- (gun clicks)
- Terence Turner.

01:26:07.627 --> 01:26:09.464
Michael Clarke, I presume.

01:26:14.535 --> 01:26:17.004
I don't suppose I could
interest you in a bribe?

01:26:18.705 --> 01:26:20.207
I do have rather a lot of money.

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:22.209
Stop talking.

01:26:26.513 --> 01:26:29.917
I've got just one
last question for you.

01:26:35.788 --> 01:26:37.524
How are you gonna claim
self-defense

01:26:37.657 --> 01:26:39.192
if you shoot an unarmed man?

01:26:40.594 --> 01:26:43.096
Luckily for me,
there's a nearby concrete pour

01:26:43.229 --> 01:26:46.532
that will hide
any unlawful transgression.

01:26:46.666 --> 01:26:49.102
I think that's how you put it.

01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:52.305
True.

01:26:54.474 --> 01:26:59.646
You do know if it wasn't me, it
would have been somebody else?

01:27:00.613 --> 01:27:02.282
That works both ways.

01:27:02.416 --> 01:27:03.551
Yeah?

01:27:07.888 --> 01:27:09.424
(gunshot)

01:27:16.429 --> 01:27:19.399
Clarke. Clarke.

01:27:20.734 --> 01:27:25.305
- You OK?
- Yeah, great, you?

01:27:34.014 --> 01:27:36.717
- Clarke.
- (gasps)

01:27:36.850 --> 01:27:40.920
BAKER: It's alright. We're gonna
take you to somewhere safe.

01:27:41.054 --> 01:27:42.722
MICHAEL: Jesus...

01:27:43.523 --> 01:27:45.026
You!

01:27:46.093 --> 01:27:48.129
You know who I am?

01:27:49.229 --> 01:27:50.998
Michael Clarke.
