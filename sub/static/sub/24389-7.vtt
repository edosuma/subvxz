[Abel] <i>I wanted to build
an innocent-looking little car</i>

00:11.512 --> 00:13.305
<i>that was a monster inside</i>

00:13.514 --> 00:15.015
so that people would say, "Wow!"

00:16.183 --> 00:18.519
[John] <i>My electric car
leaves the line instantly.</i>

00:18.685 --> 00:20.205
<i>It's just like you're shot out
of a cannon.</i>

00:20.229 --> 00:21.230
[engine roaring]

00:21.355 --> 00:23.982
<i>There would be no Tesla
if it wasn't for what we were doing.</i>

00:24.274 --> 00:27.486
[Ron] <i>I'm gonna go all the way,
as far as my machine will let me go,</i>

00:27.611 --> 00:30.781
<i>and if it breaks, it breaks,
if it wins, it wins.</i>

00:30.906 --> 00:33.367
[Debbie] <i>There's no other car
like this car.</i>

00:33.534 --> 00:36.328
<i>I mean, the performance is unbelievable.</i>

00:36.912 --> 00:39.957
[Abel] <i>Nothing comes close
to when you really feel inside like,</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:41.416
<i>"Wow. I'm going fast."</i>

00:41.583 --> 00:43.335
[Debbie] <i>People underestimate me,</i>

00:43.710 --> 00:45.629
<i>but I have an amazing car.</i>

00:45.754 --> 00:47.631
<i>One of the fastest cars in the world.</i>

00:48.006 --> 00:49.967
[Ron] <i>Nobody remembers last place.</i>

00:51.051 --> 00:52.678
[engines roaring]

00:55.847 --> 00:57.474
[man] Shit!

00:57.599 --> 00:58.642
[Debbie] Oh, my God.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.286
- [man 1] Do you copy?
- [man 2] <i>10-4. Copy.</i>

01:13.699 --> 01:16.159
<i>Lamborghini was always on my bucket list,</i>

01:16.451 --> 01:20.038
<i>and, I mean, I remember having, like,
a poster, I think it was a Countach,</i>

01:20.247 --> 01:23.125
<i>like the white one. I think most car
people had that in their room,</i>

01:23.584 --> 01:27.254
and I put it on the refrigerator
as a goal like,

01:27.462 --> 01:28.672
<i>"This is what I want to get."</i>

01:28.880 --> 01:32.217
<i>I got into commercial real estate
and started making a lot of money,</i>

01:32.342 --> 01:33.760
and who doesn't like money?

01:35.304 --> 01:37.264
And then eventually, I got it.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.953
<i>I still can't believe it. Eventually,
while it was in my garage,</i>

01:41.977 --> 01:43.395
I would go open the door,

01:43.520 --> 01:45.439
and I'd look to see
if it's still there,

01:46.148 --> 01:48.150
<i>like a lot. </i> [chuckles]

01:48.400 --> 01:50.569
<i>You know? 'Cause it feels like a dream.</i>

01:51.528 --> 01:53.048
<i>You know, it still feels like a dream.</i>

01:55.240 --> 01:58.368
<i>I grew up in Los Angeles in the valley.</i>

01:59.077 --> 02:01.663
<i>I was a valley girl, grew up
with all the valley girls</i>

02:01.747 --> 02:04.541
and said, "Oh, my God, totally,"
and, "Gag me with a spoon."

02:05.334 --> 02:07.878
<i>I actually got a car
when I was 15 and a half,</i>

02:08.044 --> 02:09.420
like, "Smack, get your permit,

02:09.630 --> 02:10.631
you're ready to roll."

02:11.423 --> 02:14.468
So, I got a red Datsun 280Z,

02:14.635 --> 02:17.429
<i>and it was just... it was awesome.
Like, it was pretty cool.</i>

02:17.554 --> 02:20.641
You know, a 280 back then was fast,

02:21.725 --> 02:24.728
<i>and, like, after school,
I'd race with the boys,</i>

02:24.936 --> 02:28.815
and most of the time, I won,
so that was even cooler.

02:30.776 --> 02:35.947
<i>This car is a 2016 Lamborghini Aventador.
This is the SV.</i>

02:36.031 --> 02:37.783
<i>It's a special edition,</i>

02:37.908 --> 02:40.577
so this is one of 600 cars in the world.

02:40.911 --> 02:45.248
This car is a pure adrenaline rush.

02:45.624 --> 02:48.502
<i>You barely touch the gas, and it's flying.</i>

02:48.710 --> 02:52.339
It's powerful, it's... orgasmic.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.342
I don't listen to the music,

02:55.467 --> 02:58.595
I listen to the exhaust,
to the engine, to the sound.

02:59.012 --> 03:02.557
[engine roaring]

03:02.891 --> 03:03.975
It makes me happy.

03:05.852 --> 03:09.398
<i>This car looked the closest to a Batmobile</i>

03:09.690 --> 03:13.610
that... I would think I would get
without paying probably $4 million.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.699
<i>It's not every day you see
a Lamborghini Aventador SV,</i>

03:18.824 --> 03:22.619
and then the girl gets out of the car,
and she's wearing Batman stuff.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.500
People are like, "Holy shit.
What the hell?" [chuckles]

03:30.460 --> 03:33.004
<i>I always loved Batman,
just what he represented.</i>

03:33.213 --> 03:35.799
<i>You don't have to have superpowers
to be a superhero.</i>

03:36.091 --> 03:37.676
I just kind of related to that.

03:40.595 --> 03:43.515
<i>So, there is a drag race coming up,</i>

03:44.057 --> 03:48.437
and I'm excited,
because... I don't really drag race...

03:49.396 --> 03:52.315
but that's fine. I mean, I track my car,
I go on rallies.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.799
I've done tons of things,
but I've actually never drag raced,

03:54.860 --> 03:57.154
so I'm pretty excited. Definitely.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.490
I'll be honest,
I have never done launch control,

04:01.074 --> 04:04.119
<i>because you can't just do it anywhere,
you know?</i>

04:04.453 --> 04:07.330
Might get arrested. [laughs]
It's very fast.

04:08.039 --> 04:11.126
<i>But if I want to win in a drag race,
I have to do it,</i>

04:11.460 --> 04:14.796
<i>so it makes me kind of nervous,
because...</i>

04:15.088 --> 04:17.132
I'm pretty sure my car is...

04:18.341 --> 04:21.470
<i>probably worth more than their house is.
I'm very competitive.</i>

04:21.553 --> 04:24.973
I like to win, you know? And I think also,
being a woman,

04:25.223 --> 04:27.309
<i>it is just so hard in like, the car world.</i>

04:27.517 --> 04:28.602
<i>You don't get much respect,</i>

04:28.727 --> 04:30.771
<i>so being a female and winning</i>

04:30.979 --> 04:32.647
would really be frickinâ€™ awesome.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.651
I'd like them to eat my dust.
Is that what they say? "Eat my dust"?

04:37.027 --> 04:39.321
Do we get, like, an award...
if the super car wins,

04:39.780 --> 04:43.492
you get a super car on top
of a sleeper car, like, crushing it.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.285
<i>No, I'm kidding.</i>

04:47.788 --> 04:50.457
<i>Do you want to see the world's
fastest-accelerating</i>

04:50.540 --> 04:51.875
<i>electric car in history?</i>

04:52.000 --> 04:53.293
It's right there.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.698
[John] That is the world record.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.881
It'll do the quarter mile
in 10.258 seconds

04:58.006 --> 05:00.509
at 123.79 miles an hour.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.970
I maintain, boldly so

05:04.137 --> 05:06.890
there would be no Tesla
if it wasn't for what we were doing.

05:08.058 --> 05:11.228
It sounds like I got a fat head
if I tell you I think I'm a pioneer,

05:11.311 --> 05:14.189
but if I'm being perfectly honest
with you, yeah, I am.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.776
But some people think
I'm just a little crazy.

05:21.071 --> 05:24.282
This used to be
a 69-horsepower economy car,

05:25.033 --> 05:27.077
noted for its high gas mileage.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.412
It now runs on electricity.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.333
It's simply controlled
by the varying of this throttle.

05:33.416 --> 05:36.086
It's kind of like turning the volume
up and down on a stereo.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.421
So, instead of a gas tank...

05:39.339 --> 05:40.465
we have a battery pack.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.138
<i>I don't think I wanted to be different.</i>

05:47.389 --> 05:49.182
<i>I know I was different.</i>

05:50.684 --> 05:52.978
<i>You know, I was the weird little kid
that was always,</i>

05:53.061 --> 05:55.063
<i>you know, talking about science and math,</i>

05:55.146 --> 05:57.649
<i>and I was always interested
in the way things ran.</i>

05:59.985 --> 06:02.737
<i>The electric thing was planted in me
at an early age.</i>

06:02.904 --> 06:07.075
<i>My father-in-law was an interesting man,
and I was in his garage,</i>

06:07.367 --> 06:10.579
<i>and I literally stubbed my toe
on something, which hurt,</i>

06:10.787 --> 06:13.874
and I'm kind of, you know,
a few choice words,

06:14.082 --> 06:15.709
and he goes, "You know what that is?"

06:15.917 --> 06:19.212
And I says, "No, it hurt," and he says,
"That's out of a DC-3 aircraft."

06:20.213 --> 06:21.464
And it was a generator,

06:21.631 --> 06:23.300
and it was this big around,

06:23.675 --> 06:24.759
it was that long.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.113
<i>He says, "You know, if you can turn
that into a motor,</i>

06:27.137 --> 06:29.681
<i>that would power a car,"
and I kind of laughed. I said,</i>

06:29.806 --> 06:32.577
<i>"That would power a car?" He goes,
"Yeah. That'd move a car really well."</i>

06:32.601 --> 06:33.727
<i>So, he gave it to me.</i>

06:34.102 --> 06:36.182
<i>So, I found this little Datsun 1200
I got real cheap,</i>

06:36.479 --> 06:39.482
<i>and I crudely bolted this electric motor
up to the transmission,</i>

06:39.733 --> 06:42.110
<i>and I grabbed a collection
of used car batteries,</i>

06:42.319 --> 06:46.114
and I sparked them together
with a big splash, and off I went,

06:46.489 --> 06:49.784
and it flew out the driveway
with the tires literally smoking,

06:50.452 --> 06:51.870
<i>and it broke the transmission,</i>

06:51.995 --> 06:53.675
<i>and there was fluid all over the driveway,</i>

06:53.705 --> 06:55.415
and I was going, "This is great!"

06:55.498 --> 06:57.375
I mean, I discovered torque,
electric torque,

06:57.459 --> 06:59.019
and nobody had ever told me about this,

06:59.085 --> 07:00.725
and that just lit it right there. I went,

07:01.171 --> 07:03.971
<i>"Wow. The world's got to realize
that this is the way to do the thing."</i>

07:04.007 --> 07:06.509
<i>I mean, this little, tiny motor
had all this power.</i>

07:08.345 --> 07:11.056
It's just a mind-blowing car to drive.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.017
Every time I accelerate to 60
in under two seconds,

07:14.142 --> 07:15.769
I find this big grin on my face.

07:15.852 --> 07:20.357
The electric power in this car
is absolutely amazing.

07:24.069 --> 07:27.364
<i>I'm doing the race because I think
it's gonna be good for the electric car</i>

07:27.489 --> 07:31.201
to show it knocking heads with something
very exotic and powerful and expensive.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.870
<i>It's been about four years</i>

07:33.995 --> 07:35.675
<i>since I've actually competed with the car,</i>

07:35.789 --> 07:37.707
<i>and my battery pack is aging.</i>

07:37.791 --> 07:39.125
<i>It is now 10 years old,</i>

07:39.334 --> 07:41.086
but it appears to be in top shape,

07:41.294 --> 07:43.713
<i>so we'll put it on the track
and see what it does.</i>

07:44.214 --> 07:45.340
I enjoy a good race.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.901
There's always something faster
out there,

07:46.925 --> 07:48.843
I'm sure there's cars
that could beat this car

07:48.927 --> 07:50.637
but... not a lot of them.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.183
Electric cars are definitely better
than gas cars.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.227
<i>They don't make any pollution.</i>

07:57.519 --> 07:59.270
<i>Everybody likes clean air,
for God's sakes!</i>

07:59.896 --> 08:01.773
It seems kind of like a no-brainer to me.

08:07.070 --> 08:10.031
My name is Ron Schneider,
I live in Nuevo, California

08:10.115 --> 08:14.077
and my car is a 2005 Dodge Ram
3500 Diesel.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.498
<i>This truck is an extension of me,
which is all about show...</i>

08:19.541 --> 08:21.209
<i>but all about go as well.</i>

08:23.628 --> 08:26.188
I've always known I've been destined
to be good behind the wheel.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.467
It's just something that's in me.
When I have the opportunity to show off,

08:29.759 --> 08:32.359
you know, I'm just good at it,
and that's just what I enjoy doing.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.187
<i>As far as getting hooked in the cars,</i>

08:41.354 --> 08:43.481
<i>I used to go out at night and...</i>

08:43.648 --> 08:45.358
snag my parents' Ford Ranger truck,

08:45.567 --> 08:46.776
you know, at the age of 13,

08:46.860 --> 08:49.404
which, you know obviously,
didn't have a license at that time,

08:49.529 --> 08:51.698
<i>and I just kind of taught myself
how to drive.</i>

08:51.823 --> 08:54.284
<i>I mean, I was towing trailers
at the age of 14 and 15,</i>

08:54.909 --> 08:58.705
<i>and all the way through high school,
I was always working on vehicles,</i>

08:58.788 --> 09:01.041
and I even went as far as doing
the high school drag.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.419
He was even racing while he was in me...

09:05.253 --> 09:06.880
because he came out like "boom."

09:07.005 --> 09:08.256
[laughter]

09:08.798 --> 09:10.234
[Ron] <i>I have such an amazing family.</i>

09:10.258 --> 09:11.593
<i>They're part of my crew.</i>

09:11.676 --> 09:13.261
<i>They support me 100 percent.</i>

09:13.845 --> 09:15.263
I should say closer to 200 percent,

09:15.346 --> 09:17.807
'cause they're always there
making sure that, you know,

09:18.058 --> 09:20.602
that I feel supported and loved.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.270
He's gonna kick ass.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.897
[laughter]

09:24.439 --> 09:25.690
I'm telling you that right now.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.295
[Ron] <i>I mean, a family that races
and plays together stays together.</i>

09:29.319 --> 09:30.959
<i>That's the way we've always looked at it.</i>

09:33.782 --> 09:38.620
1999 is when I got the invite
to the Warren Rock Crawling Nationals.

09:40.914 --> 09:44.501
<i>The easiest way to describe rock crawling
is taking modified Jeeps</i>

09:44.584 --> 09:48.713
<i>and driving them up rocks and canyons
that you couldn't even walk up.</i>

09:48.838 --> 09:51.299
I mean, it's stuff that vehicles
should not be able to do.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.930
<i>My wife, who is actually my teammate,
she was what's called a spotter,</i>

09:57.138 --> 10:00.225
<i>which is your eyes and ears
outside the vehicle,</i>

10:00.642 --> 10:03.478
<i>and, I mean, she only weighed,
you know, 110 pounds wet,</i>

10:03.770 --> 10:07.357
<i>but her speed, her agility,
and her ability to get out there</i>

10:07.440 --> 10:09.484
<i>and get me lined up
on where I needed to go,</i>

10:10.235 --> 10:11.945
rivaled anybody else.

10:13.655 --> 10:14.697
[man] Go, go, go!

10:14.781 --> 10:17.909
I was very well known
in the rock crawling industry

10:18.118 --> 10:19.160
<i>as "Rollover Ron,"</i>

10:19.536 --> 10:21.680
<i>because that was what
would always show up in the videos,</i>

10:21.704 --> 10:23.123
<i>always show up
in the magazines,</i>

10:23.289 --> 10:24.290
Ron's upside down.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.923
<i>We raced together for over a decade,
you know, all through the West Coast.</i>

10:32.173 --> 10:35.468
<i>In fact, both my boys grew up
in the back of those buggies.</i>

10:37.554 --> 10:41.724
<i>The reason we stopped rock crawling
was the doctors basically told her</i>

10:41.808 --> 10:45.061
<i>that she was done picking up
heavy rocks the way she was.</i>

10:45.854 --> 10:49.357
And at that time, we decided
that we would try something different.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.484
<i>I went out and bought her a dragster,</i>

10:51.651 --> 10:52.891
and we just started going fast.

10:55.989 --> 10:59.534
<i>Unfortunately, after being together
for, you know, 18, 20 years,</i>

10:59.951 --> 11:02.287
<i>we just kind of separated and grew apart.</i>

11:02.912 --> 11:06.040
<i>You know, to this day,
I still don't know exactly why or how.</i>

11:06.624 --> 11:09.294
<i>We both just stopped racing,
went our own ways.</i>

11:11.504 --> 11:14.591
It was very tough. I mean,
it still gets to me to this day.

11:22.765 --> 11:26.603
<i>At that time, I sold off the dragster,
because I had built it for my ex-wife,</i>

11:26.686 --> 11:29.522
<i>so it was time to let it go
along with everything else,</i>

11:30.023 --> 11:31.691
<i>and I was left with the truck,</i>

11:31.900 --> 11:34.360
<i>and one of the signature things
I did to it,</i>

11:34.444 --> 11:37.572
<i>was I put dual 6-inch stacks
out through the shell.</i>

11:38.781 --> 11:40.783
You know, go big or go big, go big,

11:40.909 --> 11:44.996
<i>and I went from a single turbo over-sized
to dual turbos</i>

11:45.371 --> 11:49.042
<i>to upgrading the turbos bigger
to upgrading the injectors bigger.</i>

11:49.167 --> 11:50.752
You know, it's a rocket ship.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.316
I would say the biggest reason
it's a sleeper

11:55.340 --> 11:58.301
is because from the outside,
it looks pretty normal.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.137
<i>You know, it's still got
full leather interior, heated seats,</i>

12:01.262 --> 12:03.765
<i>full stereo system,
air conditioning, cruise control,</i>

12:03.890 --> 12:07.101
<i>and you know, people look at it,
and they way underestimate it,</i>

12:07.685 --> 12:09.479
till I mash that pedal
and it comes to life.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.233
<i>There's a lot of pressure.</i>

12:13.358 --> 12:16.069
<i>You know, I've got my family,
I've got my crew that, you know,</i>

12:16.194 --> 12:18.947
I don't want to let down and I don't want
to let the other diesels

12:19.072 --> 12:20.883
<i>and the other trucks of the world down
as well.</i>

12:20.907 --> 12:23.219
You know, I feel like there's a lot
riding on my shoulders.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.827
Where you've got the advantage is,

12:25.119 --> 12:27.538
when you get ahead of them
and you got all that smoke,

12:27.789 --> 12:29.791
they can't see where the hell
they're going.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.125
[boy] <i>Yeah.</i>

12:42.262 --> 12:44.222
You always try to keep them
somewhat hungry

12:44.347 --> 12:47.392
so you can have control over them.
The feed is a control.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.354
I've had pigeons
since I was about 7 or 8 years old.

12:51.854 --> 12:55.066
I've had them for such a long, long time,
it's a part of me now.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.277
In my local club,

12:57.443 --> 12:59.612
I almost all the time win
every single fly.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.907
I've came in second in the nation
two years in a row.

13:03.241 --> 13:04.575
<i>I look at it this way,</i>

13:04.909 --> 13:07.245
why are you gonna waste your time
doing anything

13:07.578 --> 13:09.205
if you're not gonna be the best at it?

13:09.497 --> 13:11.541
<i>And I wanted to be number one
in the pigeons</i>

13:11.624 --> 13:14.085
just like I wanted to be number one
with the Mazda racing.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.133
<i>My very first car,</i>

13:20.258 --> 13:21.676
which my mom and my uncle

13:21.759 --> 13:23.428
purchased for me for my 15th birthday

13:23.678 --> 13:26.681
<i>was the 1976 Mercury Capri Ghia,</i>

13:27.015 --> 13:29.892
and there was only one interest
and one purpose,

13:30.018 --> 13:33.271
and that was to go out
and get whoever I could find at the light

13:33.646 --> 13:35.315
<i>and make everyone my victim.</i>

13:36.649 --> 13:38.735
But then one day, the tables turned,

13:38.943 --> 13:41.404
<i>and I encountered this weird-sounding car,</i>

13:41.654 --> 13:44.240
<i>and we pulled up to the light
and we took off,</i>

13:44.490 --> 13:46.784
and he just, like, left me.
I was like,

13:46.993 --> 13:48.995
"Man! What's going on here?"

13:49.287 --> 13:51.207
<i>So, then I said,
"Hey, what kind of car is that?"</i>

13:51.372 --> 13:53.809
<i>He said, "It's a Mazda." I said,
"What kind of engine does it have?"</i>

13:53.833 --> 13:57.086
He goes, "Rotary engine."
And it was just... I had to have one.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.839
<i>These rotary engines,
compared to the piston motors,</i>

14:00.131 --> 14:01.549
<i>have a lot less moving parts.</i>

14:01.883 --> 14:04.302
<i>There's no valves. There's no pistons.</i>

14:04.510 --> 14:05.678
<i>It's real tiny, it's simple,</i>

14:05.803 --> 14:08.014
<i>and this is capable of making
a 1,000 horsepower.</i>

14:13.686 --> 14:15.313
So, it's the late '80s.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.814
Life is great.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.108
<i>I got a hold of my first Mazda RX-2.</i>

14:19.359 --> 14:21.944
<i>I'm going to the street races,
making a little bit of money,</i>

14:22.487 --> 14:25.990
<i>I'm going to USC,
studying to be a mechanical engineer,</i>

14:26.157 --> 14:27.617
<i>and then, all of a sudden,</i>

14:27.784 --> 14:30.703
one day, my girlfriend goes,
"I'm pregnant,"

14:31.120 --> 14:33.623
and that sort of became the turning point.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.919
<i>And that's when I decided
that there was no way</i>

14:38.002 --> 14:41.381
<i>I was gonna be able to finish college
and get good grades</i>

14:41.589 --> 14:43.275
<i>and at the same time
try to support a family</i>

14:43.299 --> 14:44.967
<i>and take care of her and the baby.</i>

14:47.720 --> 14:51.182
The way I got into racing
was I got this R-100.

14:51.307 --> 14:54.769
<i>It made excellent power,
so I went down to the local track...</i>

14:55.978 --> 14:57.313
and, wow!

14:57.772 --> 15:00.775
The first pass was, like, real, real fast.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.860
They went, I think, 9.30 or 20.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.155
<i>Came back around and did another one,
and we went an 8.60,</i>

15:06.531 --> 15:10.118
which at the time was the fastest time
for a rotary engine car

15:10.201 --> 15:13.037
and import car in the world,
and just like that,

15:13.246 --> 15:14.539
it just blew all over.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.041
<i>I mean, I started getting phone calls
from everyone,</i>

15:17.333 --> 15:19.168
<i>you know, companies wanting to help,</i>

15:19.377 --> 15:21.921
and that's how my professional career
got going.

15:22.505 --> 15:25.675
<i>Abel Ibarra, one of the pioneers
of import drag racing.</i>

15:26.175 --> 15:29.470
I've had three race cars:
1971 Mazda R-100,

15:29.971 --> 15:31.431
very successful with that one.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.015
<i>Then I built</i>

15:33.182 --> 15:34.475
<i>a second race car,</i>

15:34.684 --> 15:36.727
<i>a 1995 Mazda RX-7.</i>

15:36.936 --> 15:39.981
Abel Ibarra has one of the baddest RX-7s
on the planet.

15:40.273 --> 15:43.609
<i>Here comes Abel Ibarra,
one of the hottest guys going.</i>

15:43.734 --> 15:45.945
[Abel] <i>That's the car that I had
my most success with.</i>

15:46.571 --> 15:48.614
<i>I won tons of money with that car.</i>

15:48.739 --> 15:51.325
<i>I think one year I had a $75,000 paycheck.</i>

15:52.076 --> 15:55.872
Then my last car is my 2004 Mazda RX-8.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.416
<i>That's the car that I've actually gone
the fastest with,</i>

15:58.666 --> 16:01.586
but the competition
started to get so rough

16:01.669 --> 16:03.880
at that later stage of the import racing,

16:04.046 --> 16:05.965
<i>and I just didn't have the funding</i>

16:06.090 --> 16:09.093
<i>that those teams did at the time
to be able to be successful.</i>

16:11.304 --> 16:13.222
<i>I had to stop racing,
because by this time,</i>

16:13.639 --> 16:15.308
my two daughters were getting older,

16:15.433 --> 16:17.477
<i>and I had to put them through college,</i>

16:17.560 --> 16:20.688
<i>and I wanted to make sure at least
if I didn't get to finish college,</i>

16:20.771 --> 16:22.690
<i>I was gonna try
to do the best that I could,</i>

16:22.815 --> 16:26.152
so I had to, whatever money
I could come up with or save,

16:26.402 --> 16:28.029
use that for them and the family

16:28.237 --> 16:31.282
<i>instead of spending it on the race car
so that the race cars just sat.</i>

16:31.532 --> 16:33.326
<i>I had to put them on the back burner.</i>

16:34.869 --> 16:37.288
My car that I have now...

16:37.622 --> 16:40.708
<i>is a 1972 Mazda RX-2,</i>

16:41.167 --> 16:44.629
<i>exact same thing as my first Mazda RX-2.</i>

16:44.795 --> 16:47.423
I wanted to bring back those memories
of my first Mazda.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.259
<i>It's taken quite a while to build,</i>

16:50.468 --> 16:53.012
<i>not only because of how much work
is involved,</i>

16:53.179 --> 16:54.931
<i>but because of the expense involved.</i>

16:55.139 --> 16:58.184
The car, from the outside, untouched.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.977
<i>Original paint job,</i>

17:00.228 --> 17:02.480
<i>like it came from Mazda in 1973,</i>

17:02.980 --> 17:04.857
<i>interior, original,</i>

17:05.148 --> 17:06.526
<i>but on the inside,</i>

17:06.608 --> 17:08.903
<i>it has the best parts that money can buy</i>

17:09.069 --> 17:10.820
<i>with the best technology available</i>

17:10.946 --> 17:12.865
for any car to date.

17:16.577 --> 17:17.912
I love my little Mazda RX-2.

17:17.994 --> 17:19.121
It's just so simple,

17:19.329 --> 17:21.415
but it's just a complete monster,

17:21.540 --> 17:24.167
and the best part about it is,
that I can drive it normal.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.378
I can drive it like a grandma.
I can go to the store.

17:26.587 --> 17:29.048
<i>But when I want
to get that adrenaline rush</i>

17:29.131 --> 17:31.717
<i>and really, really go fast,
all I got to do is give it some gas,</i>

17:31.842 --> 17:33.052
<i>and off we go.</i>

17:35.346 --> 17:37.473
<i>It's been a long time
since I actually have been</i>

17:37.723 --> 17:39.600
<i>in a real race scenario,</i>

17:39.684 --> 17:41.018
<i>probably close to 10 years,</i>

17:41.394 --> 17:42.728
<i>so you have no idea</i>

17:42.895 --> 17:44.605
how bad I want to win.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.191
<i>I think it will let other people know</i>

17:47.358 --> 17:48.877
<i>that, "Hey, Abel hasn't gone anywhere.</i>

17:48.901 --> 17:50.736
<i>He's making a comeback
with his street car,</i>

17:50.861 --> 17:53.221
and pretty soon, he's gonna be
out there with the race car."

18:04.500 --> 18:06.895
[man 1] What if you come up
with a socket from the bottom side?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.599
- [man 2] We can try it.
- [Ron] Hey, guys.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.089
[man] Yep?

18:10.214 --> 18:14.510
Looks like we're going
against a 2016 Lamborghini Aventador.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.846
- All right.
- So, we need to talk about tunes,

18:16.929 --> 18:19.241
we need to talk about setup,
talk about everything we need to do

18:19.265 --> 18:21.684
to make this girl put out it in first
against that thing.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.728
That's a 2016, so...

18:23.936 --> 18:25.771
Yeah, so you're 691 to 740 horsepower.

18:26.147 --> 18:27.815
- Okay.
- Roughly 4,000 pounds.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.317
- That's half our weight.
- Yeah.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.961
Four hundred thousand dollars, you know?

18:30.985 --> 18:32.546
- Okay.
- We almost got that in our motor.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.530
[laughter]

18:34.739 --> 18:36.657
- The convertible's 450.
- Okay.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.422
Just got to get low 10s and we're golden.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.345
- You've got the tune for it.
- Yep.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.806
- Let's get back to work.
- Let's get this thing back on the road.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.207
<i>The biggest reason I'm confident
going into this event now</i>

18:45.333 --> 18:48.502
knowing what we're going against
is what you see right over there,

18:48.586 --> 18:50.129
is my crew.
They're the best around.

18:50.671 --> 18:53.090
<i>Most of my team is family
and good friends.</i>

18:53.299 --> 18:55.176
<i>I got my tuners that came in
from Michigan</i>

18:55.343 --> 18:56.862
<i>just to tune this truck for this race.</i>

18:56.886 --> 19:00.097
<i>You know, they're gonna set this truck up
exactly for what we need.</i>

19:00.473 --> 19:03.434
<i>Between the tuning that we got
and the turbo setting in,</i>

19:04.018 --> 19:06.979
<i>we'll dial in our tires,
and if I need it halfway down the track,</i>

19:07.063 --> 19:09.398
<i>I'll spray nitrous
and finish off the rest of it.</i>

19:12.818 --> 19:16.364
[John] <i>Evidently, I'm gonna race
a Lamborghini Aventador SV.</i>

19:17.114 --> 19:19.116
Let's just see what that thing
can do here.

19:19.367 --> 19:20.618
Aventador. Here we go.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.729
Yeah, that's gonna be a good race.

19:22.870 --> 19:26.290
6.5 liter, that's a big one, V12,

19:26.457 --> 19:27.625
seven-speed.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.960
Yeah, that's a pretty quick machine.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.796
2.7 to 60.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.398
You're definitely gonna get
off the line.

19:33.422 --> 19:36.302
- Yeah, I think so. Well, you know...
- That thing's geared for high-end.

19:36.384 --> 19:39.220
[John] <i>Yeah, he's gonna have fun
trying to catch up to me, I think.</i>

19:39.637 --> 19:42.139
[Ron] Well, the thing that you've
got going for you is...

19:42.223 --> 19:44.475
My good looks? Oh, okay.
Sorry. What?

19:45.059 --> 19:47.103
All you need to do is push the pedal down.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.105
<i>That car needs a skilled driver,</i>

19:49.188 --> 19:51.375
somebody who's got to be able
to clutch that thing off the line

19:51.399 --> 19:52.441
and go through the gears.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.902
Yeah, but once he gets
into the right gear,

19:54.985 --> 19:57.071
he's gonna be sucking me up
on the quarter mile.

19:57.238 --> 19:59.156
Perhaps, if he's not way too far behind.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.640
Yeah, we'll see if we can psych him
out on the launch, right?

20:11.877 --> 20:15.297
[Debbie] <i>I believe things happen
for reasons,</i>

20:15.464 --> 20:17.174
<i>and I honestly believe</i>

20:17.299 --> 20:19.385
<i>we're all on a path,
and we're just following it,</i>

20:19.468 --> 20:22.638
and I believe certain things
came into my...

20:22.888 --> 20:25.057
my path like that was meant to be.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.437
<i>It was always in my head,
what could I do to make a difference?</i>

20:29.603 --> 20:30.980
<i>So, I dressed as Batgirl,</i>

20:31.105 --> 20:32.625
<i>and I went to the children's hospital.</i>

20:32.690 --> 20:34.316
<i>I bought toys out of my own money,</i>

20:34.483 --> 20:37.027
<i>and I saw how happy it made the kids...</i>

20:38.571 --> 20:41.741
and then I saw a little girl named Lilly

20:41.824 --> 20:43.159
<i>on my Instagram...</i>

20:43.826 --> 20:47.580
<i>and I said, "Wow," and it had
the back of her, she had, like, a cape.</i>

20:48.205 --> 20:51.208
<i>And now Lilly, at the time,
she's going through Chemo,</i>

20:51.292 --> 20:53.377
<i>and she was seven or eight months,</i>

20:53.502 --> 20:55.337
<i>but she started
when she was three months old,</i>

20:56.088 --> 20:57.673
<i>so I went there,</i>

20:57.882 --> 20:59.383
and Trish, who's Lilly's mom,

20:59.675 --> 21:04.430
<i>introduced me to this world
that I just didn't know really existed,</i>

21:05.222 --> 21:07.057
<i>like, childhood cancer, you know?</i>

21:07.600 --> 21:09.018
<i>I never knew about it.</i>

21:09.935 --> 21:11.145
You gonna put a cape on?

21:11.979 --> 21:13.439
[all] Aww.

21:13.647 --> 21:14.648
Nice.

21:15.232 --> 21:18.444
- Thanks for the demo, Lil.
- [Debbie] You made that look so easy.

21:18.903 --> 21:21.614
<i>It doesn't just take money,</i>

21:21.781 --> 21:23.073
it takes heart.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.409
<i>She didn't just walk us
through my daughter</i>

21:25.618 --> 21:27.161
<i>becoming cancer-free,</i>

21:27.286 --> 21:30.915
<i>she's walked through us with me
launching our nonprofit foundation,</i>

21:31.332 --> 21:34.752
<i>she has helped us fund three funerals.</i>

21:34.919 --> 21:37.254
She is family to our community.

21:37.463 --> 21:38.964
You look good, girl.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.760
[Debbie] <i>It's a good feeling, you know,
to see a kid smile,</i>

21:42.843 --> 21:44.678
<i>'cause I know what they go through.</i>

21:45.429 --> 21:47.681
<i>When you meet a child with cancer,</i>

21:47.848 --> 21:50.100
it changes your life forever.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.812
<i>Like, you don't look at things the same.</i>

21:56.732 --> 21:58.859
<i>You know, they have to appreciate her day,</i>

21:59.026 --> 22:01.654
and I think other people
need to appreciate her day too.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.576
<i>I don't think I'm a superhero,
I think they're superheroes,</i>

22:07.660 --> 22:11.539
like, because... they go through so much.

22:12.790 --> 22:17.628
I think, yeah, it would actually be cool
to kind of win for, you know... the kids.

22:23.968 --> 22:26.088
[Abel] <i>They already let me know
what car we're racing,</i>

22:26.178 --> 22:27.972
<i>and it's gonna be a 2016</i>

22:28.138 --> 22:29.431
<i>Lamborghini Aventador.</i>

22:29.598 --> 22:31.117
- Who's driving the car?
- [Abel] Look.

22:31.141 --> 22:33.495
Might be some rich guy that doesn't
even know how to drive his car.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.996
- We might get lucky.
- [man 1] We don't know.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.100
- [man 2] And get a easy pass?
- And get a easy pass.

22:37.147 --> 22:39.942
It's the fastest Lamborghini,
and if we stand a chance,

22:40.067 --> 22:42.945
we're definitely gonna have
to hook up the vehicle speed sensor

22:43.112 --> 22:44.613
so that we can do the boost by gear,

22:44.697 --> 22:46.907
and we can get maximum traction
in every gear.

22:47.032 --> 22:50.035
We'll turn this thing up, you know?
We'll give it everything it's got.

22:50.578 --> 22:52.496
Raise it up so we can get it going.

22:53.664 --> 22:55.082
All right.
Right there. That's good.

22:55.457 --> 22:58.043
Good spot right here
so we can run this thing back inside.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.087
It's better
if we go up through the trunk.

23:00.170 --> 23:03.132
Yes. Yeah, that's what I was...
That's exactly what I was thinking.

23:03.507 --> 23:06.552
[Abel] <i>The Aventador has a lot of power,
and I believe it's all-wheel drive.</i>

23:06.677 --> 23:08.929
That car's gonna get maximum traction,

23:09.054 --> 23:12.892
<i>so that car's gonna pretty much
put down 740 horsepower in every gear,</i>

23:13.309 --> 23:15.352
<i>so I need to have every advantage
I can get</i>

23:15.978 --> 23:19.440
<i>by installing this vehicle speed sensor,
that allows me to manipulate</i>

23:19.565 --> 23:21.734
<i>how much horsepower I can put down
in every gear.</i>

23:22.401 --> 23:25.446
<i>Then I could get my car to accelerate
to the full potential</i>

23:25.571 --> 23:27.156
<i>and not lose any traction.</i>

23:28.157 --> 23:30.784
The problems I've had
is overheating damaging the motor,

23:30.868 --> 23:32.119
so here's what I'm gonna do,

23:32.369 --> 23:34.163
I recently added this

23:34.330 --> 23:35.664
high-powered blower.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.499
Moves a lot of air. Pretty quiet.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.186
But right now, it only comes on
when I tip the throttle in,

23:40.210 --> 23:41.712
which is fine for street driving,

23:41.837 --> 23:44.024
but at the drag track,
when you go down the quarter mile

23:44.048 --> 23:47.343
and you really put a lot of juice
in the motor, it gets hot really fast.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.637
You know what I have
that might interest you?

23:49.887 --> 23:52.449
<i>It's a little temperature sensor,
and you can just have it be automatic.</i>

23:52.473 --> 23:54.473
- You got to show me that.
- So, here's what I got.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.728
This is a little temperature sensor,
really simple.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.571
- It's just a little bimetallic strip.
- Yep.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.565
You can mount that in the exit air,

24:02.107 --> 24:05.402
and as soon as it heats up,
it'll turn your fan on and keep it on.

24:05.527 --> 24:08.948
- What temperature does it trigger at?
- It's, like, around 100 degrees.

24:09.907 --> 24:12.218
- Kind of like a thermostat in the house.
- Yeah. It's very simple.

24:12.242 --> 24:14.370
I like this idea. I really do.
We can just,

24:14.453 --> 24:17.081
- like, put it in here somewhere.
- Perfect.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.876
<i>I've been driving it hard on the street
for four years,</i>

24:21.043 --> 24:23.203
but that's a lot different
than taking it to the track,

24:23.671 --> 24:26.799
balls-out, and you're putting 2,000 amps
in the motor.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.385
It gets hot, and then you pass
another 2,000 amps,

24:29.468 --> 24:30.987
and at that point,
that's enough combined heat

24:31.011 --> 24:33.097
to melt the armature and ruin it,

24:33.472 --> 24:35.182
so we've added a temperature switch.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.851
When it starts getting warm,
it's gonna kick on the fan.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.205
If it gets cool enough,
it'll just shut itself off again.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.606
So, we're adding
an automatic temperature-controlled

24:42.731 --> 24:44.483
higher-velocity fan to the whole thing.

24:46.276 --> 24:47.277
- It works!
- Yeah.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.448
And yes, I admit it,
I was kind of doubting you.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.787
[Abel] Okay. Go ahead, Joe. Strap it up.

24:59.957 --> 25:01.637
<i>We're gonna put the car on the engine dyno</i>

25:01.959 --> 25:03.879
to make sure
that the sensor's working correctly.

25:11.802 --> 25:13.595
<i>I've had great success with race cars.</i>

25:14.054 --> 25:16.181
<i>Now with my Mazda RX-2,
I want to prove that,</i>

25:16.682 --> 25:19.762
"Even though you may have a brand-new car
with all the technology in the world

25:19.810 --> 25:21.645
<i>I can build a street bucket sleeper</i>

25:21.812 --> 25:23.313
<i>that will outdo your brand-new,</i>

25:23.647 --> 25:25.274
<i>highly-sophisticated car."</i>

25:26.191 --> 25:28.986
[engine revving]

25:31.697 --> 25:34.658
The ultimate thing is I want to win
and prove to everybody

25:34.867 --> 25:38.037
not even so much what Abel can do
but what the little Mazdas can do.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.879
<i>For this occasion,
we're going up against a supercar,</i>

25:46.962 --> 25:49.339
<i>and going up against that kind of
speed and power,</i>

25:49.590 --> 25:53.135
we're gonna go
to our new 33" 22.50 slicks,

25:53.385 --> 25:56.221
and as you can tell,
I mean, that is a tire.

25:56.597 --> 25:58.849
That's... that's as big as my arm,

25:59.058 --> 26:02.394
so that rubber right there
is what is gonna put that truck

26:02.603 --> 26:03.604
down the track.

26:11.361 --> 26:14.406
One off. Let's get the big rubber in here.

26:16.158 --> 26:18.077
All right. Look at that.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.832
Let's see that Lamborghini
try and spin these tires this big.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.585
There we go.
That's what I'm talking about right there.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.192
That'll put our power to the ground.

26:28.962 --> 26:31.173
<i>The next thing,
we're gonna start playing with our tune,</i>

26:31.590 --> 26:34.194
<i>making sure we have enough fuel
to be able to spray nitrous if we need it,</i>

26:34.218 --> 26:36.845
<i>and just making sure our numbers are right
where they need to be.</i>

26:37.054 --> 26:39.932
All right, Mike. I think it's gonna
definitely come down to...

26:40.432 --> 26:42.643
to tune and setup,
so what are you thinking?

26:42.810 --> 26:45.813
We should pull a little bit of fuel
and timing out of the bottom end

26:45.896 --> 26:47.648
- so we can get some traction.
- Okay.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.291
- Make the truck hook up...
- Good call.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.485
...and then hit it hard on top with fuel

26:51.735 --> 26:53.278
- when we spray the nitrous.
- Okay.

26:53.695 --> 26:56.532
<i>I know what this truck can do.
I know what my crew can do.</i>

26:56.824 --> 26:58.575
<i>I mean, I got the best guys
in the industry</i>

26:58.700 --> 27:00.452
<i>when it comes to diesel
standing behind me.</i>

27:00.536 --> 27:02.246
<i>This truck is built, not bought.</i>

27:02.704 --> 27:04.581
<i>It's ready to rock right now.
Ready to go.</i>

27:12.047 --> 27:15.801
[Debbie] <i>When it comes to sleeper cars,
I don't think all of them are junk cars,</i>

27:15.884 --> 27:17.427
<i>'cause they fix them up really nice,</i>

27:17.511 --> 27:20.848
<i>I just know
that there's probably different levels.</i>

27:20.973 --> 27:23.892
Like, on my car, you know
how fast my car goes.

27:24.393 --> 27:28.647
<i>It's a book. "This is how fast it goes,"
depending on the driver and a few things,</i>

27:28.856 --> 27:30.649
but I think in a sleeper car,

27:30.732 --> 27:32.985
like, you don't know, right?

27:33.235 --> 27:37.489
Like, how fast, like, you know,
how much power they have in that car.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.909
[Abel] Eilan, the new race car driver.

27:44.830 --> 27:47.916
Look. He knows what to do already.
Look... [imitates car sound]

27:48.250 --> 27:50.353
You have to make sure,
when you're doing tests on the streets,

27:50.377 --> 27:52.129
that the police do not see you,

27:52.254 --> 27:54.649
<i>and you can't get greedy,
you have to only do it once or twice</i>

27:54.673 --> 27:55.799
<i>and then call it a day.</i>

28:12.065 --> 28:13.942
<i>The car's really, really fast,
it's performing,</i>

28:14.067 --> 28:18.614
and even though I know it's a fast car,
the Aventador,

28:18.739 --> 28:21.241
<i>you know, it's a different story
once you get into competition.</i>

28:21.325 --> 28:22.951
<i>Maybe this guy hasn't raced before,</i>

28:23.118 --> 28:25.412
<i>you know, he's just a rich guy
that drives his car around,</i>

28:25.495 --> 28:27.891
<i>but I bet you he doesn't have
as much racing experience as me,</i>

28:27.915 --> 28:29.499
<i>so that's why I'm pretty confident</i>

28:29.583 --> 28:31.303
<i>where he's probably gonna get
a bit nervous.</i>

28:41.345 --> 28:43.156
[John] <i>Well, I'm back
at the drag track tonight</i>

28:43.180 --> 28:46.350
<i>because I haven't been to a drag track
with a car for about four years,</i>

28:46.433 --> 28:48.769
but I want to see
what my car's still got in it,

28:48.894 --> 28:50.974
<i>and if there's any quirks,
I can get them ironed out,</i>

28:51.521 --> 28:54.161
and plus it's just back in my blood again.
I want to hit the strip.

28:54.483 --> 28:57.277
[announcer]
<i>Hundred and fifteen miles an hour.</i>

28:58.362 --> 28:59.446
- Electric?
- Yep.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.242
Oh, my God. Son of a bitch!

[announcer] <i>He does a heck of
a lot of smoking,</i>

29:28.225 --> 29:31.061
<i>One hundred miles an hour!</i>

29:31.687 --> 29:35.190
- So, what do you think, Gadget?
- Looks like the cells are still rocking.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.818
- After 10 years.
- After 10 years. Wow.

29:38.652 --> 29:42.656
I'm real happy that the car is running
in sixes in the 1/8 mile

29:42.739 --> 29:45.176
right out of the box
after being off the track for four years.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.053
Oh, my God,
and these batteries are 10 years old,

29:47.077 --> 29:50.038
and it's putting out that kind of...
I mean, that's very amazing.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.083
I think Lambo is in trouble.
You know, it's gonna be close.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.544
But, you know, I think we got him.

<i>and I get in the car and we do
the burn-up, instinct's gonna kick in.</i>

31:24.091 --> 31:27.260
It's a rotary. I love it.
It's gasoline's attempt...

31:27.469 --> 31:28.929
- to be an electric motor.
- Yeah.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.332
[Abel] Hello. How you guys doing?

31:30.430 --> 31:32.116
- My name's Abel.
- I didn't know if I could come

31:32.140 --> 31:33.409
- and meet you. I wanted to.
- I know.

31:33.433 --> 31:34.518
You know, I love this car.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.561
- [Abel] You do?
- [John] I love rotaries.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.040
[Abel] Well, we love your car, too.
We're surprised to see a Datsun.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.733
Yeah, nice car.
Yeah, I'm a big fan of these,

31:42.526 --> 31:44.820
and that's a very big turbo
you have there.

31:45.237 --> 31:46.446
- Thank you.
- Yeah, I like it.

31:46.905 --> 31:49.157
- I mean, how can you not like a rotary?
- [man] Exactly.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.743
- It's almost an electric motor.
- Almost, huh?

31:52.577 --> 31:53.620
It uses a lot of fuel.

31:53.703 --> 31:55.580
[John] <i>One of my favorite cars
is a rotary.</i>

31:55.789 --> 31:58.500
They make a lot of high-end horsepower,
so...

31:59.459 --> 32:01.795
<i>I think I'll probably nail him
off the line,</i>

32:01.920 --> 32:04.400
but he'll be reeling me in
with that high horsepower coming on.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.091
Nice. Very nice.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.051
It's all original interior,
original paint.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.971
Well, that's the best part.
That's the best part.

32:11.805 --> 32:14.641
So, on mine, because I run on torque,

32:15.517 --> 32:18.478
I have a 325 direct drive,
no transmission.

32:18.728 --> 32:19.896
No transmission!

32:22.107 --> 32:23.817
Interesting. Electric car.

32:23.900 --> 32:27.404
When he showed us it was electric,
I'm like, "Wow." We got our work cut out.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.590
Forget about the rest of the cars.
That one's gonna be

32:29.614 --> 32:31.717
the one out front first.
We're gonna have to play catchup.

32:31.741 --> 32:33.981
- Now that sucker's light.
- [man] There's nothing in it.

32:34.411 --> 32:37.873
[Abel] That sucker's probably 1500 pounds.
That's almost not even fair.

32:38.331 --> 32:39.875
Forget about the Lambo.

32:41.626 --> 32:42.794
Oh, my God.

32:49.926 --> 32:52.905
- A lot of pollution coming out of those.
- [man] Lot of pollution. That's right.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.182
[tires screeching]

32:55.515 --> 32:59.269
That represents everything I hate
in vehicles that pollute too much.

32:59.603 --> 33:02.230
<i>I understand he's modified it
and he's having a good time with it,</i>

33:02.439 --> 33:04.608
but it is belching out more smoke
and pollution

33:04.691 --> 33:06.193
than all the cars here combined.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.241
Those motors aren't as big
as one of my turbos.

33:13.366 --> 33:14.743
[chuckles]

33:15.452 --> 33:16.888
- [Abel] How you guys doing?
- [Ron] Good.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.306
- How's it going today?
- Good. Good. Good.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.650
- My name's Abel.
- Abel. I'm Ron.

33:19.706 --> 33:22.209
- Nice to meet you, Ron.
- She's a beautiful little car.

33:22.959 --> 33:25.587
This was my street car.
I mainly did it for the freeway

33:25.712 --> 33:27.464
- or the half-mile stuff.
- There you go.

33:27.547 --> 33:30.026
- Not to quarter mile it.
- But it's never been on a track before.

33:30.050 --> 33:31.944
- Yeah. Never been on the track.
- Beautiful, though.

33:31.968 --> 33:34.012
That rotary Mazda is a bad-ass little car.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.556
<i>Definitely representing
the sleeper cars out there,</i>

33:36.723 --> 33:38.183
<i>but it doesn't have enough ponies.</i>

33:38.350 --> 33:40.352
That engine's not as big
as one of my turbos.

33:40.644 --> 33:42.163
Good luck today.
We'll be talking to you later.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.981
Good luck. We're all gonna need it,
especially against that white one.

33:45.106 --> 33:47.186
That's the shocker right there.
Wait till you see it.

33:47.776 --> 33:50.904
- Look at this gorgeous girl.
- They're invading our space. No!

33:51.029 --> 33:53.448
- We got to come see the real cars here.
- Oh, my gosh.

33:53.532 --> 33:54.699
- Hi, I'm John.
- Ron.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.177
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.911
- So, here comes the electronics.
- Yep.

33:58.161 --> 34:00.481
That's about how big my batteries
are for my stereo system.

34:00.914 --> 34:02.207
- There you go.
- Yep. Yep.

34:02.999 --> 34:05.752
The one I'm most worried about, honestly,
is the electric car,

34:05.919 --> 34:07.504
<i>just all of that torque.</i>

34:07.671 --> 34:10.257
<i>If those little tires can handle it,
that car's gonna be quick.</i>

34:13.009 --> 34:16.054
[Debbie]
<i>When I dress in the Batgirl outfit,</i>

34:16.137 --> 34:18.306
<i>that's where they hit me
with the most insults.</i>

34:18.431 --> 34:20.100
Look at that. Batmobile.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.643
[Debbie]
<i>But as long as I make a child smile</i>

34:22.726 --> 34:24.996
<i>and they're forgetting
about the hell they're going through,</i>

34:25.021 --> 34:28.358
<i>that's all that matters. They can say
what they want about me.</i>

34:28.608 --> 34:31.110
[Abel] <i>I'm not gonna say
all super car owners are cocky,</i>

34:31.319 --> 34:33.362
<i>but most of them,
they'll see a car like mine</i>

34:33.446 --> 34:34.989
<i>pull up at a light and, likeâ€¦</i>

34:35.072 --> 34:36.753
<i>I'm not even gonna waste my time
with you."</i>

34:37.701 --> 34:39.369
That's a mean car right there.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.556
That's a killer car right there.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.081
[man] Oh, I like that.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.002
I am so confused.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.899
I have so many thoughts
going through my head.

34:51.922 --> 34:52.924
[man] Well, welcome here.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.235
- [Debbie] Thank you.
- [man 1] Welcome.

34:54.259 --> 34:55.579
[man 2] She's got a designer bag.

34:57.596 --> 34:59.222
- How you doing?
- I'm fine. How are you?

34:59.306 --> 35:00.932
- Good. I'm Ron.
- Hi. Debbie.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.577
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.481
- It's a cute little ride.
- [Debbie] Thank you.

35:04.686 --> 35:06.646
- So, I like Batman, obviously...
- [Ron] Okay.

35:06.980 --> 35:09.733
...and I do a lot of stuff
for a children's hospital,

35:09.816 --> 35:11.234
- kids with cancer.
- [Ron] Nice.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.486
This is actually a custom wrap,

35:13.695 --> 35:16.364
and I honor some of the kids
that passed away

35:16.740 --> 35:18.908
and some that are cancer survivors.

35:18.992 --> 35:21.786
- [John] Good for you. Batgirl, right?
- Yeah.

35:21.870 --> 35:24.910
- I like what you're doing. It's very nice.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

35:25.457 --> 35:27.459
Yeah, as you were pulling up, I'm going,
"Okay.

35:27.584 --> 35:30.378
I don't know what to think about this."
That's pretty awesome.

35:34.215 --> 35:36.176
[Abel] <i>I think it's a tossup
between the Datsun</i>

35:36.301 --> 35:38.136
<i>and the Dually getting up front first,</i>

35:38.470 --> 35:39.989
<i>and I think I'm gonna have to play
catch-up.</i>

35:40.013 --> 35:41.848
<i>I just hope I have enough to catch him.</i>

35:43.975 --> 35:45.977
[Debbie] <i>Definitely,
I feel a lot on my shoulders.</i>

35:46.102 --> 35:47.729
<i>You know, I've got Lilly</i>

35:47.896 --> 35:51.024
<i>and my whole cheering team on,
and I want to win for them.</i>

35:51.941 --> 35:54.277
[Ron] <i>I've got to make sure
the diesel is behind me</i>

35:54.653 --> 35:57.656
<i>so that somebody else can put up
with the fumes coming out of it.</i>

35:58.907 --> 36:01.785
<i>I would say, a supercar,
it's definitely got some advantages,</i>

36:01.868 --> 36:03.846
<i>you know, with all of the electronics
and everything,</i>

36:03.870 --> 36:06.748
<i>but I don't think it's gonna hold up
against just pure power.</i>

36:06.831 --> 36:08.391
<i>We're gonna win big today. Yes, we are.</i>

36:13.171 --> 36:15.298
[announcer]
<i>Drivers and crew, gather around.</i>

36:15.799 --> 36:18.385
We're gonna draw straws
to pick the lane right now.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.011
You want to help me? Here. Come on.

36:20.095 --> 36:22.889
Whatever you pick is fine. Go ahead.
Just go eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

36:23.973 --> 36:26.851
[man]
That's pretty good. You pick the one.

36:27.060 --> 36:29.020
- Lane number one for you.
- Four.

36:29.604 --> 36:32.148
- Lane number two.
- So, Ron picked lane number one,

36:32.607 --> 36:35.485
Debbie picked lane number four,
Abel picked lane number two,

36:35.610 --> 36:37.153
and John got lane number three.

36:37.612 --> 36:38.863
The winner of this race

36:38.988 --> 36:40.573
will move on to the grand finale

36:40.865 --> 36:44.494
to face six other drivers
in a seven-wide race

36:44.869 --> 36:46.454
at El Mirage Dry Lake.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.974
[Ron]
<i>I'm feeling really confident right now.</i>

36:58.091 --> 37:01.177
<i>My crew and my team did an excellent job
of getting my truck ready,</i>

37:01.386 --> 37:04.013
<i>and we put in the wrench time,
and now it's time to perform.</i>

37:05.640 --> 37:07.559
[Abel]
<i>I want to see what my little car can do.</i>

37:07.642 --> 37:10.812
<i>I've never really had it opened up
like we're gonna open it up today.</i>

37:11.646 --> 37:14.315
<i>I'm just gonna go out there
and just do my race.</i>

37:14.399 --> 37:15.519
<i>I don't care who I'm racing.</i>

37:15.775 --> 37:17.736
<i>The ultimate thing is I want to win.</i>

37:18.361 --> 37:20.241
[Debbie]
<i>I got to say, I'm a little bit nervous.</i>

37:20.447 --> 37:23.158
<i>You know, is the car gonna slide into me?
Who knows?</i>

37:23.241 --> 37:24.510
<i>It does make me a little nervous</i>

37:24.534 --> 37:27.871
<i>thinking about who is actually driving
that car beside me.</i>

37:28.580 --> 37:30.707
[John] <i>My car is ready.
It's got full torque instantly</i>

37:30.790 --> 37:32.292
<i>the minute I touch the throttle.</i>

37:32.459 --> 37:34.645
<i>I just have to make sure
I don't give it so much throttle</i>

37:34.669 --> 37:36.004
<i>that I can't control the car.</i>

37:38.757 --> 37:41.509
[Ron] <i>Very unusual selection of vehicles
that we have today.</i>

37:42.010 --> 37:44.554
<i>Having electric, having diesel,
having rotary,</i>

37:44.679 --> 37:46.097
<i>and of course, the supercar.</i>

37:46.848 --> 37:48.892
<i>I see us out in the winner's circle,
definitely.</i>

38:03.907 --> 38:06.409
[engines roaring]

38:09.913 --> 38:11.122
Shit!

38:13.666 --> 38:14.709
[Debbie] <i>Oh, my God.</i>

38:15.835 --> 38:17.253
[John shouting]

38:17.629 --> 38:18.713
Fuck.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.694
[man] Guys, off the court.
Fire and ambulance are coming in.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.572
- Off the court.
- [John] Fuck that shit.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.832
- Did he just lose control, or...
- I don't know.

38:53.915 --> 38:55.726
One of the car lose control,
and they hit each other.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.394
- [woman] They hit each other.
- [man] Yeah. Exactly.

38:57.418 --> 38:59.003
Why do these things happen to me?

39:00.213 --> 39:02.533
- [man] I'm very sorry, but you're okay?
- [John] I'm fine.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.801
[Abel] I'm all right. I'm fine.

39:06.094 --> 39:08.614
[John] <i>Well, nobody did that on purpose.
It was just loss of traction.</i>

39:08.638 --> 39:09.806
<i>It never hooked up.</i>

39:10.223 --> 39:13.351
[Abel] Why does this happen to me?
Why? Why, why, why?

39:13.560 --> 39:15.704
<i>He's been racing that car for a long time.
He should have known.</i>

39:15.728 --> 39:17.522
<i>It happened for somebody
being irresponsible.</i>

39:18.231 --> 39:19.649
- Sorry about your car, man.
- Yeah.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.235
You should have...

39:22.402 --> 39:24.863
- [man 1] Mario. Mario. Do you copy?
- [man 2] <i>10-4. Copy.</i>

39:24.988 --> 39:26.364
[man 1] Everybody's okay, luckily.

39:26.948 --> 39:29.242
<i>Who won the race? Who won the race?</i>

39:29.492 --> 39:30.493
[cheering]

39:30.618 --> 39:32.996
[man] <i>White truck won the race.
The Lambo came in second.</i>

39:36.124 --> 39:37.542
[Ron] <i>I feel like a million bucks.</i>

39:38.209 --> 39:39.562
<i>We wouldn't have got here
without my crew</i>

39:39.586 --> 39:42.964
<i>and the hard work that they put in,
my tuners that came down from Michigan,</i>

39:43.131 --> 39:45.550
but I'll tell you what, unbelievable run.

39:45.717 --> 39:49.178
The truck went straight,
powerful all the way down, never let up.

39:49.596 --> 39:50.763
She charged hard.

39:51.014 --> 39:52.974
Damn! Fucking what a run.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.268
[Trish whooping]

39:55.518 --> 39:57.103
- Oh, my God.
- You're alive.

39:57.312 --> 40:00.356
Oh, my God. I'm fine. See?
I'm fine. I'm okay.

40:01.566 --> 40:05.153
[Debbie] <i>My launch control didn't work,
so I was the last off the line,</i>

40:05.361 --> 40:08.740
<i>and then I got really scared
when I saw that guy lose control,</i>

40:08.990 --> 40:10.630
<i>and I didn't know if he was gonna hit me.</i>

40:10.867 --> 40:13.161
<i>Then I just punched it,
and I just kept going.</i>

40:13.953 --> 40:15.455
Something I learned today,

40:15.663 --> 40:17.665
let a 5-year-old pick your lucky lane.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.959
I think I'm gonna go play lotto
on the way home.

40:22.837 --> 40:26.424
[Ron] <i>Which one got squirrelly?
The electric? The electric car?</i>

40:26.507 --> 40:27.759
<i>I had a feeling it would.</i>

40:27.926 --> 40:31.071
That's why I told you I wanted to be on
the outside. I didn't want him next to me,

40:31.095 --> 40:32.907
because if it came,
I could have gotten over it.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.475
- You got him twice, it looks like.
- Yeah. We hit twice.

40:35.642 --> 40:36.684
Yeah.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.968
- No, you hit twice.
- I'm not sure how it all happened.

40:39.062 --> 40:40.104
It happened pretty fast.

40:40.229 --> 40:42.389
<i>If I was in his shoes,
I'd probably be going, you know,</i>

40:42.440 --> 40:44.400
"Gee, dude.
You know, keep your car in your lane."

40:44.484 --> 40:45.735
<i>But who knows what happened?</i>

40:47.070 --> 40:48.964
[man] <i>Sure looked like you broke
something in the axle.</i>

40:48.988 --> 40:51.175
- See? You can see from the skid marks.
- It just went crazy.

40:51.199 --> 40:53.910
- [man] You just went sideways.
- [John] Plus, it wasn't hooking up.

40:54.911 --> 40:56.287
- I feel bad for his car.
- I know.

40:57.747 --> 41:00.458
<i>I feel bad for him, because earlier,</i>

41:00.541 --> 41:02.752
we were talking about the pride
he had in his car,

41:02.835 --> 41:05.555
<i>the fact that it was mostly factory paint,
which I really appreciate,</i>

41:05.588 --> 41:07.840
and, you know, it's... it's ruined.

41:09.550 --> 41:10.635
I love my cars,

41:11.386 --> 41:12.947
<i>especially when you put
that much hard work</i>

41:12.971 --> 41:13.972
<i>into them for that long.</i>

41:14.347 --> 41:16.808
<i>To fix that thing right
is probably gonna take 15 to 20.</i>

41:16.933 --> 41:19.533
<i>After all the money I've spent,
I can't fix it. I can't afford it.</i>

41:19.602 --> 41:21.722
<i>I have a little boy. I have to worry
about his future,</i>

41:21.771 --> 41:24.857
and it wouldn't be right for me
to put him on the back burner.

41:24.941 --> 41:26.192
It doesn't work that way.

41:34.742 --> 41:35.868
You okay, though?

41:35.952 --> 41:37.328
- I am all right.
- All right.

41:37.412 --> 41:40.707
Come here. It's okay. It's all right.

41:41.207 --> 41:43.209
- How'd you do?
- My launch didn't work, so...

41:43.292 --> 41:45.169
It didn't work. So, you had to roll out?

41:45.336 --> 41:46.379
It's okay.

41:47.088 --> 41:50.383
So, that's a pretty terrible ending
of a beautiful day.

41:50.466 --> 41:52.635
- Yeah.
- Unfortunately, this is racing.

41:52.760 --> 41:53.803
It happens sometimes.

41:54.053 --> 41:56.389
Ron, you clearly won, so congrats on that.

41:56.556 --> 41:58.558
- Thank you.
- You will be going to El Mirage

41:58.808 --> 42:00.184
- with your truck.
- Nice.

42:00.435 --> 42:02.937
- And face six other driver.
- Nice.

42:03.062 --> 42:04.897
So, that was a great win.

42:06.357 --> 42:07.358
Good job.

42:07.483 --> 42:10.945
Yeah, baby. Yeah.
That's what I'm talking about right there.

42:11.904 --> 42:13.573
Yeah. Yeah.

42:14.907 --> 42:17.243
This race was actually
beyond important to me.

42:17.452 --> 42:19.912
It brought my life back around full circle

42:20.079 --> 42:22.707
through the struggles
that I've had recently.

42:23.124 --> 42:24.804
<i>You know, divorced four or five years ago,</i>

42:24.876 --> 42:26.729
<i>back where I'm supposed to be,
and that's racing.</i>

42:26.753 --> 42:28.504
You did good, bro. You did good.

42:28.755 --> 42:31.275
- That was a fucking run, man. God!
- Beautiful, man. Beautiful.

42:31.632 --> 42:34.802
I can't even describe how amazing
it feels right now inside

42:35.094 --> 42:38.097
to have the support
of everybody behind me.

42:40.224 --> 42:42.018
It's awesome. Love it.

42:43.305 --> 42:49.473
