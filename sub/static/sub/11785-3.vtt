40:47.528 --> 40:48.738
YEAH.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.991
MR. FORD, THAT WAS A HELL

40:48.780 --> 40:51.991
OF A PIECE OF WORK.

40:52.033 --> 40:54.911
THE GENTLEMAN THAT WAS LISTENING

40:52.033 --> 40:54.911
IN ON MY APARTMENT, I PRESUME.

40:54.953 --> 40:58.039
WIRETAPS WITHOUT WARRANTS

40:54.953 --> 40:58.039
ARE A FELONY.

40:58.081 --> 40:59.791
LISTEN, HERE'S THE THING.

40:59.832 --> 41:02.501
WE HAD SOME OUTSTANDING

40:59.832 --> 41:02.501
CONTRACTS WITH MR. ROCKWELL.

41:02.543 --> 41:04.421
I don't suppose you'd consider

41:02.543 --> 41:04.421
taking them on...

41:04.462 --> 41:06.005
for a substantial fee.

41:06.047 --> 41:07.548
I DON'T WORK THAT WAY.

41:07.590 --> 41:10.093
[ LAUGHS ]

41:07.590 --> 41:10.093
YOU HONESTLY DON'T, DO YOU?

41:10.135 --> 41:12.845
YOU ACTUALLY THINK

41:10.135 --> 41:12.845
YOU'RE ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.

41:12.887 --> 41:15.473
YOU CARE TO TALK THIS OVER

41:12.887 --> 41:15.473
FACE-TO-FACE?

41:15.514 --> 41:16.891
Congratulations again.

41:16.933 --> 41:19.394
GETTING RID OF SCUM

41:16.933 --> 41:19.394
LIKE ROCKWELL --

41:19.436 --> 41:21.813
YOU MADE THE WORLD

41:19.436 --> 41:21.813
A BETTER PLACE.

41:21.854 --> 41:25.024
AND INFORMATION FROM

41:21.854 --> 41:25.024
THE ORIGINAL ACCIDENT SCENE

41:25.066 --> 41:28.194
STATES THAT ROCKWELL

41:25.066 --> 41:28.194
WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE

41:28.236 --> 41:29.821
OF ALCOHOL AT THE TIME.

41:29.862 --> 41:32.240
AND IN A BIZARRE TWIST,

41:32.282 --> 41:35.410
ROCKWELL WAS CAUGHT ON

41:32.282 --> 41:35.410
A LOCAL TRAFFIC CAMERA TONIGHT

41:35.452 --> 41:38.079
CAUSING YET ANOTHER

41:35.452 --> 41:38.079
CAR ACCIDENT.
