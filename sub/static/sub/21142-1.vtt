01:34.052 --> 01:36.179
Where in hell
is your so-called magician?

01:36.346 --> 01:37.931
He will be here, Lancelot.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.558
He swore it.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.190
They're preparing for a second wave.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.784
Charge!

02:07.377 --> 02:09.838
This... this is what the end looks like.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.614
Your so-called magician, Merlin,
cannot help us.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.407
We're outnumbered, 100 to 1.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.909
How are we gonna get out of this?

02:39.076 --> 02:40.452
He promised a weapon,
one of great power.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.828
Arthur, you are my king.

02:41.912 --> 02:42.913
I will lay down my life for you,

02:43.080 --> 02:45.749
but this Merlin is no wizard.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.126
He's a worthless drunkard!

02:50.754 --> 02:53.632
God, I'm sozzled!

02:53.757 --> 02:55.676
One last nip.

03:09.106 --> 03:12.109
<i>Magic does exist.</i>

03:12.442 --> 03:14.903
<i>It was found, long ago,</i>

03:15.821 --> 03:18.615
<i>inside a crashed alien ship.</i>

03:22.994 --> 03:24.663
Hello?

03:25.580 --> 03:27.082
Hello!

03:27.916 --> 03:28.917
It is I,

03:29.084 --> 03:34.005
conjurer of spirits,
master of the dark arts!

03:34.631 --> 03:36.216
Is anyone there?

03:37.843 --> 03:40.095
It is I, Merlin.

03:40.971 --> 03:41.972
The wizard?

03:42.681 --> 03:44.141
Remember me?

03:49.813 --> 03:52.983
No! I kept your secret! I did!
Just as I promised!

03:53.150 --> 03:56.153
I told no one of your existence. No one!

03:56.319 --> 03:59.573
But you have to understand, we britons

03:59.990 --> 04:01.658
are in a desperate fight.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.161
End-of-times sort of thing. I mean it.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.246
It's happening down there
now as we speak.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.914
It's awful!

04:08.081 --> 04:11.960
Big personalities
just sort of clashing and bloody.

04:14.045 --> 04:17.132
I hate to ask... but we need your help.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.468
There are no spells. There is no magic.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.636
We retreat. Live to fight another day.

04:21.762 --> 04:22.429
No!

04:22.596 --> 04:26.475
Without sacrifice...
There can be no victory.

04:26.641 --> 04:28.101
This is madness!

04:28.268 --> 04:29.603
He will be here.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.938
All right, I am what they say!

04:32.105 --> 04:35.776
I'm a liar, I'm a charlatan.
I've deceived my whole life.

04:35.942 --> 04:40.280
But if I could, for one moment,
change this world for the better,

04:40.447 --> 04:42.616
I would give up everything. Everything!

04:42.949 --> 04:45.619
I'd give up drink, money, worn...

04:46.119 --> 04:47.454
Drink and money.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.372
Look.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.292
<i>Good men will die without your help.</i>

04:52.626 --> 04:54.294
<i>Women. Children.</i>

04:54.878 --> 04:58.381
I know your world was destroyed.
I'm sorry.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.468
But please don't let ours die, too.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.055
I beg of you.

05:05.514 --> 05:11.770
Guardian knights, transform.
Dragon is yours to command.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.606
Yes.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.234
That would be just the thing.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.531
Protect this staff.

05:22.906 --> 05:26.660
One day a great evil will come for it.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.230
Oh, yes!

06:05.824 --> 06:06.825
Charge!

06:27.220 --> 06:29.556
<i>It has been said through the ages,</i>

06:29.723 --> 06:30.974
<i>without sacrifice,</i>

06:31.892 --> 06:33.560

06:39.232 --> 06:41.067

06:41.151 --> 06:43.653
<i>we were never meant to solve.</i>

06:44.779 --> 06:47.032
<i>I am optimus prime</i>

06:47.282 --> 06:50.368
<i>and this message is to my creators:</i>

06:50.702 --> 06:53.288
<i>Leave planet earth alone.</i>

06:53.788 --> 06:55.373
<i>'Cause I'm coming</i>

06:55.707 --> 06:56.875
<i>for you.</i>

07:00.545 --> 07:02.547
<i>These are troubled times.</i>

07:06.843 --> 07:11.681
<i>Optimus prime has left us
to find his makers.</i>

07:12.015 --> 07:14.517
<i>Some say he will never return.</i>

07:15.018 --> 07:18.521
<i>His sworn enemy, Megatron...
Vanished.</i>

07:18.980 --> 07:21.775
<i>Without leaders, chaos reigns.</i>

07:21.942 --> 07:23.777
<i>Two species at war.</i>

07:23.944 --> 07:25.612
<i>One flesh, one metal.</i>

07:27.197 --> 07:30.367
<i>Transformers are declared
illegal on earth.</i>

07:30.867 --> 07:33.620
<i>The world has set up
a new paramilitary force.</i>

07:33.954 --> 07:35.705
<i>The trf.</i>

07:35.872 --> 07:37.040
<i>Except in Cuba,</i>

07:37.123 --> 07:39.626
<i>Castro lets them sun on his beaches.</i>

07:39.709 --> 07:41.836
<i>Ihola, amigo! Come om iv√©monos!</i>

07:41.920 --> 07:44.214
- No, he's busy.
- He's always busy.

07:45.674 --> 07:49.010
<i>A memo needs 'me.</i>

07:49.427 --> 07:50.679
Ice!

07:50.845 --> 07:52.389
We are not animals.

07:53.181 --> 07:56.309
<i>But these alien beings keep arriving.</i>

07:56.393 --> 07:57.727
<i>Endless waves of them.</i>

07:58.269 --> 07:59.938
<i>Too many to count.</i>

08:00.897 --> 08:03.608
<i>We look to the skies
with dread and we wonder.</i>

08:03.817 --> 08:06.528
This is the jam! I like this.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.780
Good choice. Good choice.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.491
Get it off my desk.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.910
No way!

08:14.077 --> 08:15.036
Where'd you get that?

08:15.120 --> 08:16.705
<i>How much of our time remains?</i>

08:18.206 --> 08:21.960
<i>One hundred billion trillion planets
in the cosmos...</i>

08:23.253 --> 08:25.255
No, get the director on the phone.
Go, go, go!

08:25.880 --> 08:28.049
<i>And they choose earth.</i>

08:28.258 --> 08:29.426
<i>Why?</i>

08:31.928 --> 08:33.929
Y'all want to see some dead robots?

08:36.182 --> 08:40.311
You crazy?
This is an alien no-go zone.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.690
Government doesn't want us
to go in here.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.578
We're not supposed to be here.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.664
We're kids, man.
We get away with anything.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.249
Nah, man.

09:02.333 --> 09:03.501
I'm getting me a souvenir.

09:09.424 --> 09:10.675
This is the real deal.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.635
There's a dead one over there.

09:12.761 --> 09:13.803
- Cool!
- Not cool.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.430
Trf shot 'em down.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.850
Whatever. My dad says shoot 'em all
and let god sort 'em out.

09:20.518 --> 09:21.644
<i>Chihuahua.</i>

09:22.520 --> 09:24.022
- Bro, what is that?
- Dude.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.315
It's a robot!

09:25.398 --> 09:26.399
Dude, I think it's dead.

09:26.483 --> 09:27.609
Nah, bro.

09:27.692 --> 09:28.943
Yeah, it's totally dead.

09:29.027 --> 09:30.403
He's definitely, definitely dead.

09:30.487 --> 09:31.446
I know, right?

09:31.529 --> 09:33.990
Wait, guys. I think it's moving.

09:47.337 --> 09:50.215
<i>Warning! Unauthorized trespassing.</i>

09:50.381 --> 09:52.592

<i>You are trespassing in

09:57.180 --> 09:59.849

10:00.892 --> 10:01.893
Hey!

10:21.412 --> 10:22.413
Sqweeks! Do it!

10:29.129 --> 10:30.672
Follow me!

10:43.643 --> 10:44.727
Come on, get up!

10:49.065 --> 10:50.441
Hey, sir. This area is active.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.277
We just had two sentinels go down.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.403
What have you got?

10:54.404 --> 10:56.781
Never look back!

10:58.825 --> 11:00.618
- It's coming!
- All right, go in there.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.261
Damn. I almost had a heart attack!

11:18.428 --> 11:20.096
Relax. We're covered.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.223
Sqweeks!

11:22.390 --> 11:23.516
What's that?

11:23.600 --> 11:24.767
What the...

11:25.560 --> 11:27.145
What happened to your arm?

11:27.729 --> 11:29.230
Shot you?

11:29.606 --> 11:30.607
Damn it!

11:32.233 --> 11:33.568
He can't transform.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.069
I'm trying to fix him.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.155
But you're being
a baby about it, sqweeks.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.783
It's all right. You did good.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.453
You have a big heart...

11:44.662 --> 11:45.955
That seems to be working.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.666
What's your workout routine?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.600
It's all right. It's all right. I told you.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.603
"Covered." It's canopy.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.900
Cyclops, zoom in on target.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.362
<i>Unable pid.

<i>Cannot confirm decepticon.</i>

12:21.157 --> 12:22.784
No badge. I got kids in danger.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.078
- Canopy thing's pretty crazy.
-Lt's none of your business.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.079
Stop flirting.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.332
Request immediate air support.
Danger close. Do not fire.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.002
- Who is he?
- Let's go.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.837
Far as you're concerned, my boyfriend.

12:35.672 --> 12:37.966
How long's that been going on?

12:41.678 --> 12:42.762
You kids gotta get out of here.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.722
"Kids"? You're here.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.015
I live here.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.642
This is my home.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.395
What's this?
The living room or the dining room?

12:50.561 --> 12:52.105
Someone's gotta take care of 'em.

12:52.230 --> 12:53.690
I don't think so.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.817
- They're scared. They're lost.
- Hurry.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.278
<i>I've got a heat signature.
Hostile intent is displayed.</i>

12:58.444 --> 12:59.487

12:59.654 --> 13:01.572
<i>On location 30 seconds.
Am I cleared to fire?</i>

13:01.739 --> 13:04.075
No, place, no home, no family.
Do you know how that feels?

13:04.284 --> 13:06.536
No, 'cause your asses got
big old houses to go home to.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.538
We got a condo.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.456
I love her.

13:10.707 --> 13:11.749
<i>Viper flight. We need a clearance.</i>

13:31.561 --> 13:33.396
He's down.
Bravo team, extract those kids.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.522
We're moving out!

13:38.693 --> 13:40.695
- Get up.
- I can't.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.488
No, no, no, look at me.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.575
Wake up, canopy!
You're gonna be okay.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.416
I want to thank you.

13:53.624 --> 13:57.545
Wake up, look at me. Wake up, canopy.
I'm not leaving you.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.005
You're all I have left!

14:01.132 --> 14:02.633
No,no,no.

Hey! It's all I got in my bag of tricks,
so you might want to hop in.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.446
Hey! Where are the keys?

14:23.613 --> 14:24.739
Where are the keys?

14:24.906 --> 14:26.074

14:41.005 --> 14:41.798
It's over.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.925
No! I can fix him.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.385
Nobody can fix him, he's dead.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.970
Hey, look at me.
Would he want you to die, too?

14:48.054 --> 14:49.472
Let's go, now.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.478
Come on, come on!

14:59.148 --> 15:01.609
Come on. Come on, no time, let's go.

15:01.692 --> 15:04.487
- What? Hey, you're that guy.
- No, I'm not that guy.

15:04.654 --> 15:06.864
The one who saves transformers.
I thought you were just a legend.

15:06.989 --> 15:07.990
Some legend.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.409
- You were too late!
- Go. Go.

15:09.492 --> 15:11.077
Hey, you know there's a reward
for turning you in.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.120
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.163
Cool. You want to get punched
in the face, like, really hard?

15:15.039 --> 15:16.082
No.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.917
- Good. Go.
- Okay.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.168
You're such an idiot.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.698
Easy, buddy. Yeah.

The talisman will protect you.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.055
You don't owe me anything.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.560
I can't. You keep it.

16:17.727 --> 16:19.187
Quin... quin...

16:23.733 --> 16:26.527
He didn't make it, bee.
I'm coming out solo.

It's over. Help yourself out here.

17:18.746 --> 17:21.332
Where are the others?
The ones you're hiding.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.792
I don't sell out friends.

They're in charge.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.176
You see anybody in charge?

17:32.802 --> 17:34.804
They just keep falling out of the sky.

Something's coming,
and you can't shoot your way out of it.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.126
What was that?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.295
That was a mistake.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.608
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

18:51.005 --> 18:52.882
<i>Next time you shoot somebody,</i>

18:53.007 --> 18:55.468
<i>don't go near 'em
till you're sure they're dead.</i>

18:55.551 --> 18:57.386
Put the weapon down, trust me!

18:57.553 --> 18:59.138
Easy, bee. Easy.

19:01.724 --> 19:04.101
<i>I'll burn you so bad
you'll wish you'd died as a child.</i>

19:04.268 --> 19:05.186
Shoot him!

19:05.728 --> 19:07.313
You're dead before I hit the ground.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.482
- I said stand down.
- Shoot! Shoot!

19:11.025 --> 19:11.901
Take the shot!

19:12.068 --> 19:12.735
<i>Show.</i>

19:13.235 --> 19:14.403
Don't do it, bee!

19:15.446 --> 19:17.281
Hold your fire! Hold it!

19:17.448 --> 19:18.949
You! Drop it!

19:19.116 --> 19:21.369
I'm not dropping shit.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.204
Hey.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.374
The military doesn't want it this way,
bee, you gotta believe that.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.585
It's a new world order now
and these guys are calling the shots.

19:29.752 --> 19:31.587
All they want is a home,
and you know it.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.382
You push them,
and they push right back.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.259
Hound's in town.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.345
Love starting the day off with a gunfight.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.431
Sorry I'm late.
My invitation to this ass-kicking

19:42.515 --> 19:44.517
must've got lost in the mail!

19:45.267 --> 19:46.894
Me and my crew are rolling out of here.

19:47.061 --> 19:49.146
- Call off your birds.
- Let's go.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.773
They're not gonna touch us.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.110
All right, star 1, abort.
Negative decepticon activity.

19:54.276 --> 19:57.196
Trf, stand fast. Drop your guns.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.408
You sure you don't want to shoot?
I'm a big 0l' target.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.284
<i>Wusses.</i>

20:03.285 --> 20:04.453
Whose side are you on?

20:04.620 --> 20:05.579
They're all bad.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.707
No, they're not.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.459
Eagle eye, tag him.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.133
I've never seen one like it, general.

20:18.509 --> 20:21.137
This one's older,
older than optimus prime.

20:21.303 --> 20:24.640
Decepticon barricade was spotted
at that same location.

20:29.603 --> 20:32.314
CIA's had him under pred surveillance
for a while now.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.450
Yeah, he's been keeping
some interesting company.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.994
<i>The staff is hidden on earth.</i>

20:45.327 --> 20:47.663
<i>A weapon of ultimate power.</i>

20:47.997 --> 20:49.957
<i>We'll find this staff.</i>

20:50.040 --> 20:51.459
That voice.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.586
I can hear it in my nightmares.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.421
- Megatron.
- Waiting for authentication.

20:55.504 --> 20:56.338
It's him.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.466
Lord Megatron.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.177
Get that out of my face.

21:01.427 --> 21:02.845
Report.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.473
Tell me you have found the talisman.

21:05.639 --> 21:08.559
I saw it.
A dying knight gave it to a human.

21:08.726 --> 21:11.353
But there was too much trf firepower.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.981
You let the talisman get away!

21:15.524 --> 21:17.693
We must have it!

21:18.068 --> 21:20.863
Without the talisman,
we cannot find the staff!

21:21.030 --> 21:23.115
I know who can lead us to it.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.868
The trf.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.412
Commander in chief
wants that weapon,

21:28.579 --> 21:32.666
or "staff" as he calls it,
secured at all cost.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.503
Maintain your covert embed with trf.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.880
Sir... they just don't get it.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.591
Our history with bee and the autobots.

21:41.258 --> 21:45.596
What we would all give
to have prime back right now.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.390
<i>Optimus prime.</i>

21:49.058 --> 21:51.852
<i>Re-entry cybertron.</i>

22:14.583 --> 22:16.418
My world!

22:16.919 --> 22:20.256
What has happened to my world?

22:20.422 --> 22:22.883
Your world is dying.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.972
I've been waiting for you, optimus.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.932
Come meet your maker.

22:31.225 --> 22:33.811
You are my creator?

22:34.562 --> 22:38.232
I am quintessa, the prime of life.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.362
What have you done to my home?

22:48.617 --> 22:50.661
I will kill you!

22:52.997 --> 22:55.332
You dare to strike your god?

22:57.501 --> 23:00.504
Your war doomed cybertron.

23:01.338 --> 23:03.674
Megatron started the war!

23:05.467 --> 23:08.178
You destroyed your world, you fool.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.142
My perfect creation.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.477
You're going to fix it,

23:15.811 --> 23:19.398
or the race of transformers
dies forever.

23:22.276 --> 23:23.986
I made you.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.989
You are mine to command.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.667
How did you get in here?

23:51.221 --> 23:53.098
My lord, that weird thing

23:53.182 --> 23:56.101
we've been waiting
for 1,600 years to happen...

23:56.185 --> 23:58.854
I think it's really happening this time!

24:07.655 --> 24:09.365
The knight has arrived.

24:09.531 --> 24:12.534
The talisman has been bestowed.

24:14.912 --> 24:18.374
At last, cogman. It begins.

24:39.937 --> 24:40.688
Mine!

24:50.280 --> 24:51.448
Yes!

24:54.576 --> 24:56.578
Okay. Thanks.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.417
Wembly! I was quite open.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.585
There's a reason
why you're always open.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.004
There's a reason you're always single.

25:05.587 --> 25:06.964
- What?
- What?

25:08.465 --> 25:09.466
Idiot.

25:26.567 --> 25:28.277
On, god. Okay.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.612
So late, so late, so late.

25:32.114 --> 25:37.953
484 ce. A desperate last stand
between civilization and barbarism.

25:38.454 --> 25:40.497
Two worlds colliding.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.416
Only one survives.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.418
Lancelot. Percival.

25:44.585 --> 25:45.753
King Arthur.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.296
Honorable men.

25:47.463 --> 25:50.257
Brave, muscles sinewed,

25:50.340 --> 25:53.093
sweat glistening off their bodies.

25:53.302 --> 25:56.972
A few brave men who were willing
to sacrifice all for victory.

25:57.139 --> 25:59.433
Sound too good to be true, poppy?

25:59.600 --> 26:00.809
Because it's horseshit.

26:02.311 --> 26:03.562
Arthur.

26:03.645 --> 26:07.483
A likely composite of a Roman general
and a Celtic king.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.568
Our dragon.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.945
Just a medieval catapult.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.323
And then we have Merlin,

26:14.490 --> 26:16.116
our kingmaker.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.368
Probably never existed.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.496
The question is,

26:21.497 --> 26:24.333
why? Why do we tell
ourselves these stories?

26:25.000 --> 26:27.503
Other than the fact
that dragons are wicked.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.964
It's because we want to believe.

26:31.173 --> 26:34.009
Believe that we can be heroes
in our own lives.

26:35.052 --> 26:36.553
When all seems lost,

26:36.720 --> 26:38.972
a few brave souls, us,

26:39.139 --> 26:41.225
can save everything we've ever known.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.311
Or is it just the dragons?

26:59.034 --> 27:00.202
Well,

27:01.161 --> 27:03.497
it won't be much longer now, old friend.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.333
Signs of the end are all around us.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.461
You know what to do, don't you?

27:11.296 --> 27:14.424
We must rebuild my home.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.720
There is a way to heal your world.

27:18.887 --> 27:22.432
My power of creation, the staff,

27:22.766 --> 27:26.854
was stolen from me
by my 12 guardian knights.

27:27.563 --> 27:31.066
They betrayed me and hid it on earth.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.986
<i>Gave it to your precious humans.</i>

27:34.570 --> 27:39.449
The staff is the only way
to bring life back to cybertron.

27:39.533 --> 27:42.744
You are going to find it for me.

27:43.078 --> 27:46.081
Do you seek redemption, prime?

27:47.249 --> 27:48.584
Do you?

27:48.792 --> 27:50.419
My maker,

27:51.086 --> 27:52.588
I do.

27:54.715 --> 27:59.386
No fear. No hate. No anger.

28:00.762 --> 28:05.225
No fear. No hate. No anger.

28:05.976 --> 28:08.270
Get off, you maggot!

28:09.980 --> 28:12.399
I will kill you, flying rat!

28:15.027 --> 28:17.529
He's very little. Very tiring.

28:17.613 --> 28:19.865
Losing our heads sitting around here.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.034
So tired of hiding.

28:32.085 --> 28:35.130
Hey, chief! Wow, nice...

28:35.422 --> 28:36.465
God!

28:36.632 --> 28:38.300
Nice horse you got there.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.177
You're really getting into
this whole Indian thing, huh?

28:41.136 --> 28:44.139
Don't call me chief.
My name is sherman.

28:44.348 --> 28:45.724
Aren't you the tribal chief?

28:45.807 --> 28:47.935
Yeah. But from you it sounds...

28:48.018 --> 28:49.937
I don't know, vaguely racist.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.190
- My cruiser got stolen.
- What?

28:53.732 --> 28:55.525
- Again.
- That's terrible!

28:55.651 --> 28:56.652
You know what?

28:56.818 --> 28:57.903
Shit's getting out of control.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.529
There's crime going on everywhere!

28:59.613 --> 29:00.948
A bunch of my stuff got stolen.

29:01.031 --> 29:03.700
Cut the shit, Cade...
And get me my car back.

29:14.336 --> 29:16.171
Is this an autobot hookup site?

29:16.338 --> 29:17.673
Nah, I just go here to dream.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.883
Check out that classy chassis.

29:20.842 --> 29:23.178
Look at the junk in her trunk.

29:24.012 --> 29:26.265
Booyah! Big time.

29:26.348 --> 29:29.309
I should not have eaten
all of that Tijuana street machinery.

29:29.685 --> 29:31.645
Damn, forgot about that cluster bomb.

29:31.812 --> 29:32.896
Yo!

29:33.021 --> 29:34.064
What's your problem, dude?

29:34.648 --> 29:35.607
Sqweeks!

29:35.691 --> 29:38.527
Next time, ease on the brakes!

29:38.694 --> 29:41.947
That's the way I roll.
I like to make a statement when I arrive.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.032
Well, you're getting dust
all over the campus!

29:44.157 --> 29:45.701
This ain't no campus. It's a junkyard!

29:45.784 --> 29:47.869
<i>Come on, hustle. Ianda/e, √©ndale!</i>

29:50.497 --> 29:51.498
Jimmy!

29:51.665 --> 29:53.917
Hey, don't take
any aggression out on me.

29:54.209 --> 29:56.545
Damn it, grimlock! We're guests here!

29:57.546 --> 29:59.089
You got in some shit?

29:59.256 --> 30:00.382
Yeah, neck deep!

30:00.882 --> 30:04.219
Cade, that's what you get
for taking the yellow bugger.

30:04.386 --> 30:07.014
You need a leader out there... like me.

30:07.180 --> 30:09.266
<i>Shut up. Before I do some damage</i>

30:09.349 --> 30:10.767
<i>you won't walk away from.</i>

30:10.851 --> 30:12.561
You will never be optimus prime.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.062
<i>You talk too much.</i>

30:14.146 --> 30:15.647
Come on, man.
Million-year-old legendary warrior

30:15.731 --> 30:17.816
and you act
like a bunch ofjunkyard dogs!

30:17.983 --> 30:19.359
You're starting to piss me off!

30:25.907 --> 30:27.576
Come back here, grimlock!

30:27.743 --> 30:29.745
Turn around.
What do you got in your mouth?

30:32.247 --> 30:34.916
I swear, I am wasting my time
protecting you.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.501
Drop the cruiser right now!

30:37.127 --> 30:39.046
I know you got chief sherman's cruiser.

30:39.129 --> 30:40.297
Drop it!

30:41.214 --> 30:43.884
Serves you right. Spit it out! Spit it!

30:54.895 --> 30:58.106
Don't eat cars. Don't eat cars.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.902
You get back in your hole
and think about what you did.

31:02.069 --> 31:05.113
It's like the Macy's Thanksgiving day
parade out here, Jimmy j.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.950
<i>You hired me from</i> a <i>want</i> ad
<i>in the Dakota penny ledger.</i>

31:09.117 --> 31:11.411
Think that comes with a superpower?

31:12.120 --> 31:15.082
That is a dinosaur! An alien dinosaur!

31:15.999 --> 31:17.584
That was not in the ad!

31:17.751 --> 31:19.211
It tried to eat me yesterday.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.254
You want to go to federal prison?

31:21.755 --> 31:23.423
No, no, I don't want to go to any prison.

31:23.590 --> 31:24.591
Well, that's where
you're gonna go, okay?

31:24.674 --> 31:25.926
'Cause you're aiding and abetting.

31:26.093 --> 31:27.052
I'm a fugitive, all right?

31:27.135 --> 31:28.303
I'm the big boss, you're my little crimey.

31:28.470 --> 31:29.471
When you leave,

31:29.971 --> 31:31.848
<i>it becomes the wild kingdom out here.</i>

31:31.973 --> 31:33.183
I don't know what to do.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.518
I told you, this is a junkyard.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.144
They blend in with otherjunk. That's it.

31:36.311 --> 31:39.106
You hired me to be senior vice president
of worldwide operations.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.982
- Did I tell you that?
- Yes, that's what you said.

31:41.149 --> 31:41.983
I made that shit up.

31:42.150 --> 31:44.027
Do not take this title away
from me, Cade.

31:44.152 --> 31:46.113
This is not a startup, okay?
I don't do this shit for money.

31:46.196 --> 31:47.197
It's for the higher cause.

31:47.364 --> 31:48.573
You don't do this shit for the money?

31:48.657 --> 31:50.242
What's wrong with you?
How you gonna eat?

31:50.325 --> 31:51.952
What's he doing here?

31:55.664 --> 31:56.665
Daytrader's here.

31:56.832 --> 32:00.377
Here comes the most irritating,
annoying transformer on earth.

32:00.794 --> 32:02.212
What did he give you
to get past the gate?

32:02.379 --> 32:03.213
Nothing!

32:03.338 --> 32:05.465
Hey, Cade. He gave him this.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.676
I've never seen that before in my life.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.554
Come on, say it!
You wanted the alien blaster.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.472
You said a big gun makes a big man.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.558
Hey, you know human beings
lose their temper, right?

32:14.683 --> 32:16.643
- Don't you dare! Hey, hey!
- Come here!

32:16.810 --> 32:18.812
- The worst senior vice president...
- Stop it! Stop it!

32:18.895 --> 32:21.231
Yeah, you're real tough!
What, you been working out?

32:21.356 --> 32:23.650
- Should I frag him?
- Yes, definitely frag him.

32:23.733 --> 32:24.943
I heard that, hound.

32:25.026 --> 32:26.027
Easy!

32:26.361 --> 32:29.364
Oh, god. You always resort to violence
right off the bat.

32:29.531 --> 32:30.532
I love violence.

32:30.657 --> 32:32.909
Daytrader! The hell are you doing here?

32:33.076 --> 32:34.327
You find our spaceship yet?

32:34.411 --> 32:35.620
I'm getting tired of hanging around here,

32:35.704 --> 32:36.830
waiting to catch a bullet.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.749
Carbon monoxide, and perhaps
a small gasoline drinking problem

32:39.833 --> 32:42.544
are gonna kill you long before a bullet,
my corpulent comrade.

32:42.627 --> 32:44.296
- Back off! Get out of my face.
- Watch it! Guys, stop!

32:44.379 --> 32:45.380
You want to throw down with hound?

32:45.464 --> 32:47.048
Tough guy, huh? Rude.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.593
How about you trying to carry
all this stuff?

32:55.390 --> 32:57.100
That's where that's been.

32:57.225 --> 32:58.226
Come on!

32:59.019 --> 33:00.187
Look what I found in buffalo.

33:00.270 --> 33:02.647
Starscream's head,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.649
Look what I got. New voice box for bee.

33:04.733 --> 33:05.942
Is it gonna work this time?

33:06.109 --> 33:07.694
I only got the good stuff, Cade.
Come on.

33:07.777 --> 33:10.363
You hear that, bee?
You're gonna talk, buddy!

33:10.530 --> 33:11.823
<i>Can't touch this!</i>

33:11.907 --> 33:13.241
Get down, bee!

33:13.325 --> 33:14.576
<i>Too hype, can't touch this!</i>

33:14.743 --> 33:16.369
All right, what else you got?

33:17.454 --> 33:18.997
Where'd you get that piece ofjunk?

33:19.164 --> 33:22.000
A knight of lacon talisman in this dump?

33:22.584 --> 33:23.418
Nah, it's not real.

33:23.585 --> 33:24.920
Is it? No, definitely not.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.087
Hey, give it to me, I'll take it off you.

33:26.254 --> 33:28.465
You think I don't know
what the hell this is? How valuable?

33:28.590 --> 33:30.091
But I know it's something,
because it's got you

33:30.258 --> 33:31.218
licking your chops, you skank.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.136
Words hurt, Cade.

33:33.303 --> 33:34.596
There are exactly seven... count them.

33:34.763 --> 33:36.473
Seven signs of the apocalypse.

33:36.598 --> 33:39.142
And <i>that talisman showing</i> up <i>here
is numero uno.</i>

33:39.309 --> 33:40.852
If that fancy pancake was real,

33:40.936 --> 33:43.855
I'd grab the spaceship
and blow this dirtball planet.

33:44.064 --> 33:46.358
All right, I'm gonna go
slather myself in oil.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.735
Turn your back, drift,
if it offends your sensibilities.

33:48.818 --> 33:50.946
Now that is something you can't unsee.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.572
I barely understand
what's coming out of your mouth.

33:52.697 --> 33:53.698
Hey, mister!

33:54.074 --> 33:55.367
This isn't happening.

33:55.450 --> 33:58.119
You cannot stay here, kid.
I got enough strays.

33:58.328 --> 34:01.039
I'm not a kid! I'm useful. I fix shit.

34:01.122 --> 34:03.083
- Yeah, good for you.
- Better than anyone.

34:03.250 --> 34:04.459
And I have a name, you know.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.169
It's lzabella. Lzabella with a z.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.463
I don't care if it's a z,
an emoji, or a dollar sign,

34:08.547 --> 34:09.797
all right? This is no place for...

34:09.880 --> 34:10.840
Just go home. Please.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.301
I don't got a home.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.012
And they...

34:16.929 --> 34:18.431
They just killed

34:18.806 --> 34:21.309
the last thing that I called family.

34:22.686 --> 34:24.062
So no,

34:26.022 --> 34:27.649
I'm not going anywhere.

34:29.317 --> 34:32.654
I want to stay and I want to fight them.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.156
You can't fight them,
and you can't beat them.

34:35.824 --> 34:38.326
All right? They have the support
of the entire world.

34:38.409 --> 34:39.911
You, you're a kid.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.167
Why are you still following me?

34:49.713 --> 34:51.005
T!

34:52.966 --> 34:54.342
First flames, dude!

34:55.427 --> 34:57.262
Hey! Mister! Your trailer's on fire.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.389
Hey, corner.

34:59.556 --> 35:02.100
- Oh, my god.
- Buddy! I'm proud of you.

35:02.183 --> 35:03.935
I know, but you gotta do it
outside now, okay?

35:04.144 --> 35:05.937
You could burn this whole place down.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.939
I know, but you're coming
into your power now, all right?

35:08.023 --> 35:09.649
So you gotta blow the flames... no.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.405
Terry, get me a beer, will ya?

35:15.530 --> 35:17.365
Hey, guys, you gotta cut the crap.

35:17.532 --> 35:18.950
You're tearing everything apart.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.373
Perfect delivery, buddy.
You gotta work on the pickup.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.208
I still got him in training.

35:29.419 --> 35:30.754
What happened to your family?

35:35.383 --> 35:36.426
You first.

35:36.593 --> 35:38.928
Wife passed away.
Daughter's at college.

35:39.179 --> 35:40.764
She might as well be on the moon.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.557
At least she's still here, bro.

35:42.724 --> 35:44.017
I go and visit her, we both get arrested.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.727
Is that bad enough for you, "bro"?

35:46.353 --> 35:47.937
Your turn,
unless you're too tough to share.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.358
Decepticon fired a rocket.

35:52.359 --> 35:54.235
Parents were home, I wasn't.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.738
No way I was going to foster.

35:59.741 --> 36:01.409
Hey, little guy.

36:02.202 --> 36:03.536
You're heavy!

36:03.703 --> 36:06.081
You gotta go. You can't stay here.

36:06.206 --> 36:07.207
I'm sorry.

36:12.420 --> 36:13.421
Fine.

36:14.589 --> 36:15.590
Fine.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.760
I'll bounce in the morning.

36:18.927 --> 36:21.304
Great. Look, if you're hungry,
i got some frozen pizza burritos.

36:21.388 --> 36:23.390
There might be some smucker's
in the fridge.

36:23.473 --> 36:25.141
And tell everyone where you are.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.227
Hey, am I being blackmailed
by a 12-year-old?

36:28.311 --> 36:29.312
Fourteen.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.231
You know, you're really missing out.

36:31.314 --> 36:32.982
'Cause it's okay to be a kid, little j-lo.

36:34.067 --> 36:35.443
You think you're a bad-ass?

36:35.610 --> 36:37.362
All right, tough guy,
<i>I</i> 901: A pop quiz for you.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.906
Say you got an inline energon leak
on a slant-6.

36:39.989 --> 36:42.158
Don't get it fixed,
autobot's about to bleed out.

36:42.242 --> 36:44.119
You got 30 seconds.
Now, what are you gonna do? Go.

36:44.285 --> 36:46.871
All right. First of all,
transformers don't have a slant-6.

36:46.955 --> 36:49.958
That's a Chrysler engine,
like way back in ancient history.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.334
The late '60s are not ancient history.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.877
Yeah, but if I was fixing
an energon leak,

36:53.044 --> 36:56.089
I'd cauterize the artery and re-channel
the central flow into the... the...

36:56.172 --> 36:57.841
The whatchamacallit,
the tube with the...

36:58.007 --> 37:00.009
- The doohickey thing.
- Yeah.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.219
Not bad.

37:01.428 --> 37:02.971
Watch your mouth.

37:17.819 --> 37:19.654
How long has this been here?

37:27.078 --> 37:28.663
It's growing. Yeah.

37:29.330 --> 37:30.373
Three meters a day.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.344
Six horns.

37:45.847 --> 37:47.390
Six horns, six locations.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.101
And they're growing
at an exponential rate.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.771
Alien... whatever they are.

37:53.438 --> 37:55.690
Chinese call them "horns from hell".

37:55.857 --> 37:57.358
Oh, my god.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.486
Cybertron is coming.

37:59.652 --> 38:00.737
What?

38:03.406 --> 38:04.616
I'll have 17 minutes
to brief the president.

38:04.699 --> 38:05.742
What do you got for me?

38:05.825 --> 38:07.702
It's an unmodeled perturbation mass...

38:07.786 --> 38:10.914
Look at this.
It's amazing this thing flies at all.

38:11.414 --> 38:12.624
Is it some kind of neck cancer?

38:13.792 --> 38:15.752
No. It's much worse than that.

38:15.877 --> 38:19.714
It's a gravitational anomaly
caused by a planet-sized object

38:19.881 --> 38:22.133
with a current velocity
of 1/10th light speed.

38:22.217 --> 38:25.053
That's some geek stuff. Ls it a threat?

38:25.637 --> 38:28.723
- If you just give me...
- No, I got a lunch. No.

38:29.557 --> 38:31.559
No, it's not a threat.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.312
A threat might kill you.

38:34.646 --> 38:38.066
This will kill you in three clays.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.572
How much do you weigh?

38:45.073 --> 38:47.408
Are you technically
considered overweight?

38:47.492 --> 38:48.952
No. It's just all my gear.

38:49.077 --> 38:52.288
It's like somebody packed
10 pounds of shit in a five-pound sack.

38:52.372 --> 38:55.291
- No, he's a chunky autobot.
- You wanna stop that?

38:55.375 --> 38:57.502
Hound, pull up the sat phone.

38:58.002 --> 39:01.923
I'm bouncing a signal through
Portugal, Istanbul and Katmandu.

39:02.257 --> 39:04.676
You got 20 seconds, chief.

39:07.095 --> 39:08.638
- Whoops.
- Really?

39:08.763 --> 39:10.640
Infestation of puppy transformers.

39:10.765 --> 39:12.934
This here's a big boy zone.

39:14.102 --> 39:15.103
<i>Hello?</i>

39:15.603 --> 39:17.105
<i>Hello? Dad?</i>

39:17.856 --> 39:21.192
<i>Look, I know...
I know you can't talk to me</i>

39:21.693 --> 39:23.361
<i>or say anything back.</i>

39:23.528 --> 39:25.697
<i>But you can listen.</i>

39:27.949 --> 39:31.035
<i>I'm gonna say what I always say
until you hear me.</i>

39:31.828 --> 39:34.289
<i>You don't need to save the world.</i>

39:34.455 --> 39:37.125
<i>You need a frigging girlfriend.</i>

39:38.293 --> 39:41.296
<i>Wherever you are,
i don't want you to die alone.</i>

39:42.213 --> 39:45.300
<i>And I know you only
got five seconds left, so...</i>

39:45.967 --> 39:48.469
<i>I'm fine, I'm safe.</i>

39:48.887 --> 39:51.055
<i>And I love...</i>

39:55.476 --> 39:58.354
Any longer,
they'd have snagged our location.

39:59.564 --> 40:02.150
You're a hell of a father, Cade.
Don't forget it.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.402
Hell, my dad never called me.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.537
We call it the tank.

40:14.871 --> 40:16.539
He likes it down here.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.167
This is where I deal with the dark shit.

40:19.876 --> 40:24.505
Decepticons seem just as interested
in these structures as we are.

40:24.672 --> 40:27.008
Pred snapped this in Siberia.

40:27.342 --> 40:30.929
He's been seen at all six horn locations
around the world.

40:31.012 --> 40:34.015
ID confirmed. Megatron.

40:34.641 --> 40:38.186
<i>And get this.
He made contact with trf.</i>

40:38.353 --> 40:41.856
Snatched up two CIA case officers.
Said he wants to negotiate.

40:42.023 --> 40:44.359
With him? What the hell does he want?

40:44.525 --> 40:47.612
<i>Certain alien associates of his released.</i>

40:47.779 --> 40:50.865
<i>Scheduled contact is ID 'd and cleared.</i>

40:51.366 --> 40:53.701
<i>Confirmation. Hostages are clear.</i>

40:53.910 --> 40:55.578
<i>The department of justice has okayed it</i>

40:55.703 --> 40:58.456
so long as the us military
watches his every move.

40:58.623 --> 41:01.960
You're gonna be on point,
because he is not our friend.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.215
You know who they always kill first?

41:11.094 --> 41:12.762
Lawyers.

41:12.929 --> 41:16.349
We've made deals with the devil
before during times of crisis.

41:16.516 --> 41:19.936
<i>If we're gonna get through this,
we have got to open the door</i>

41:20.019 --> 41:21.646
<i>and let the monsters inside.</i>

41:22.271 --> 41:25.733
There is a weapon out there
of unimaginable power.

41:26.234 --> 41:28.236
A threat to our very existence.

41:28.403 --> 41:30.405
And Megatron can lead us to it.

41:31.572 --> 41:34.575
Do I know you, human?

41:35.201 --> 41:37.578
- I want my crew!
- Give me names!

41:38.121 --> 41:40.790
- Mohawk.
- Mohawk?

41:43.251 --> 41:46.129
What up, fellas?
Man, I want to kill you right now.

41:49.674 --> 41:51.009
But i'ma kill you later.

41:51.092 --> 41:52.635
Definitely gonna kill y'all mofos later.

41:54.095 --> 41:56.305
- He's cleared!
- All right.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.100
<i>Dreadbot.</i>

42:00.810 --> 42:04.063
Dreadbot. In for bank robbery.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.900
<i>Aggravated assault. Murder.</i>

42:08.067 --> 42:09.652
Double murder. Triple murder.
Nine dead.

42:09.777 --> 42:11.487
Didn't even take the money. No.

42:11.654 --> 42:12.947
We're not letting him out, no.

42:16.367 --> 42:17.452
What?

42:17.952 --> 42:19.746
I mean, but we can be flexible.

42:19.912 --> 42:21.289
If he wears a GPS tracker, it's fine.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.373
Okay, 0k8)'-

42:22.457 --> 42:24.000
okay.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.252
Nitro Zeus.

42:26.419 --> 42:27.670
Baby, free at last!

42:27.795 --> 42:30.006
Thank Megatron, I'm free at last!

42:32.467 --> 42:34.552
Thank you. Gonna miss you, Tim.

42:34.635 --> 42:36.971
Thank you for your hospitality, Brad.

42:37.138 --> 42:39.265
I know where you live, Enrique.

42:39.348 --> 42:41.768
Say hello to your wife for me.

42:41.934 --> 42:44.979
But the government requests
that he does not leave the county.

42:45.146 --> 42:47.356
- And we're serious about that.
- Okay.

42:47.982 --> 42:49.108
Okay.

42:49.484 --> 42:53.321
<i>And last but not least, berserker.</i>

42:54.322 --> 42:55.907
I'll suck your brains!

42:57.950 --> 42:59.869
- Absolutely not.
- Yeah. No.

43:00.036 --> 43:02.455
No. No. There are limits. Pick again.

43:02.622 --> 43:03.748
<i>Onslaught.</i>

43:03.915 --> 43:05.917
You need a bigger door!

43:09.462 --> 43:11.506
Let me run that
up the flag pole real quick.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.924
I just got to call someone.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.468
Great, thank you. Yes. Yes!

43:15.676 --> 43:16.844
Go. Go.

43:18.012 --> 43:19.680
What do you really want, Megatron?

43:19.764 --> 43:22.475
What anyone wants, human.

43:22.642 --> 43:24.227
To go home.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.104
Yeah, that'd be all right with me, too.

43:26.270 --> 43:28.856
<i>Megatron, he's after
something yeager has.</i>

43:29.023 --> 43:31.776
Something they need
to help find this weapon.

43:31.859 --> 43:34.529
We're gonna let those Decepticons
do our dirty work.

43:34.695 --> 43:37.698
On my go, they'll be given
Yeager's hideout coordinates.

43:38.449 --> 43:40.368
You track Megatron every step.

43:41.035 --> 43:42.203
Take the weapon.

43:42.954 --> 43:44.705
And then I'm taking his ass out.

43:44.872 --> 43:49.293
No fear. No hate. No anger.

43:59.137 --> 44:00.555
Hey, guys.

44:01.139 --> 44:04.058
Rise and shine. Top of the morning!

44:07.562 --> 44:09.480
Broke our asses
bagging these Decepticons.

44:09.564 --> 44:10.606
Now they let them out?

44:11.440 --> 44:12.608
What's really going on, Lennox?

44:12.733 --> 44:13.818
Classified.

44:14.318 --> 44:15.820
Just run your team.

44:23.452 --> 44:25.079
Today,

44:25.621 --> 44:27.582
we hunt.

44:27.748 --> 44:30.835
Another glorious, boring day.

44:35.923 --> 44:37.133
<i>Air's gonna be on station.</i>

44:37.300 --> 44:40.136
<i>We're gonna have all eoir sensors
on these guys as they move.</i>

44:40.303 --> 44:42.847
<i>Flight, push tactical when airborne.</i>

44:42.930 --> 44:44.891
<i>I want air ops
locking down this transport.</i>

44:44.974 --> 44:46.976
Decepticons in sight 100%.

44:47.101 --> 44:49.604
Decepticons have just been given
Yeager's location.

44:53.858 --> 44:56.777
<i>Cyclops. Decepticons
approaching junkyard target.</i>

44:59.113 --> 45:01.616
You strapping on a decepticon arm?

45:03.326 --> 45:04.660
<i>Perfecto.</i>

45:05.411 --> 45:07.705
Well, he was an ugly little robot.

45:07.788 --> 45:09.832
You look like a warrior, sqweeks.

45:12.001 --> 45:13.336
Here goes, bee.

45:13.502 --> 45:15.630
<i>Just do whatever you want.</i>

45:15.713 --> 45:17.965
Hey, z, come on over here
and work on a real bot.

45:18.049 --> 45:19.717
<i>Doc, come in, doc.</i>

45:24.513 --> 45:25.514
That's it.

45:26.515 --> 45:27.642
No, third one on your left.

45:28.226 --> 45:29.810
No. Wait. Your left. Right here.

45:29.894 --> 45:32.647
I know what I'm doing. Don't rush me.

45:33.439 --> 45:34.607
Hey, calm the temper, okay?

45:34.815 --> 45:36.025
Think he likes this?

45:36.567 --> 45:38.110
It's like being in a dentist's chair.

45:38.277 --> 45:40.321
Do you like the dentist? No.

45:41.656 --> 45:43.824
Hound said you can only listen to her.

45:44.242 --> 45:47.161
Your daughter. You can't talk back.

45:47.495 --> 45:49.080
He's got a big mouth.

45:49.997 --> 45:51.958
Said if you do, they can voice match you

45:52.041 --> 45:54.418
from some computer somewhere
and track you down.

45:54.627 --> 45:56.587
Well, that's the world we live in.

45:59.840 --> 46:00.883
What would you say to her?

46:03.052 --> 46:04.679
Brush your teeth, work hard.

46:05.513 --> 46:08.015
Stay away from any boy in a band,
especially a drummer.

46:08.099 --> 46:10.768
Yeah, drummers are the worst,
not to mention stupid!

46:10.851 --> 46:12.603
And DJs? Real dickheads.

46:12.687 --> 46:14.146
Come on.

46:16.357 --> 46:18.526
We had a thing. All right?
A saying, back and forth.

46:18.693 --> 46:20.861
She'd always ask me,
"dad, what are you doing tomorrow?"

46:21.028 --> 46:23.197
And I'd say, "I'll figure it out tomorrow."

46:25.324 --> 46:27.827
Looks to me like you're running out
of tomorrows, yeager.

46:29.287 --> 46:31.539
That's just what she'd say.

46:33.874 --> 46:34.875
Okay, bee.

46:35.042 --> 46:36.210
Done.

46:38.296 --> 46:40.172
Come on, buddy, sit up. Let's hear it.

46:40.256 --> 46:41.549
Come on.

46:42.216 --> 46:45.219
Your real voice.
For the first time, buddy. Belt it out.

46:45.303 --> 46:46.846
<i>This is so exciting.</i>

46:46.929 --> 46:49.557
<i>No. This isn't my damn voice.</i>

46:49.890 --> 46:51.058
I'm gonna kill him, bee.

46:51.142 --> 46:52.393
<i>This is such bullshit.</i>

46:52.476 --> 46:53.686
Okay, you know what? I'm not giving up.

46:53.769 --> 46:55.313
All right? You're gonna speak
with your own voice one day.

46:55.396 --> 46:57.815
<i>Daytrader is a punk-ass bitch.</i>

47:05.823 --> 47:08.659
Cade. That thingy... that code.

47:08.909 --> 47:10.870
<i>It's a red thingy.
There's somebody coming.</i>

47:11.412 --> 47:12.997
Shit!

47:17.668 --> 47:19.920
<i>Reaper has eyes on junkyard.</i>

47:20.796 --> 47:22.590
<i>We have pid on kingfish.</i>

47:25.217 --> 47:27.470
Halt! This is protected land!

47:29.597 --> 47:31.474
Sixty seconds to evac! Let's move!

47:35.436 --> 47:36.729
<i>Cyclops, it appears
kingfish is on the move.</i>

47:36.896 --> 47:38.064
They know.

47:38.272 --> 47:40.024
We're blown, guys!
We gotta roll out now!

47:40.107 --> 47:40.983
Hey, those are the feds.

47:41.150 --> 47:43.402
I know the government
when I see the government.

47:43.569 --> 47:45.613
Grab as many weapons as you can.

47:45.946 --> 47:47.948
I'm not going to jail.
I can't go to jail, man.

47:48.115 --> 47:49.825
Hey! This is the real world.
Okay? Let's go!

47:49.950 --> 47:51.452
I can't go to jail. I'm too skinny for jail.

47:51.535 --> 47:52.453
I can't even lift weights.

47:57.375 --> 47:58.584
Bee, let's move!

47:58.667 --> 48:00.211
Give me this one.
You definitely gimme this one.

48:00.294 --> 48:01.837
This will mess somebody up good.

48:01.962 --> 48:03.923
Roll out of here, Cade.
I'm gonna buy you some time.

48:04.006 --> 48:05.758
Don't be a hero, hound.
We're out of here now!

48:05.883 --> 48:06.759
Wait! Wait!

48:06.842 --> 48:07.927
Hell, I was born a hero.

48:08.010 --> 48:08.969
You're not leaving me!

48:09.136 --> 48:10.763
You leave me, they take sqweeks.

48:10.930 --> 48:12.681
Leave sqweeks! He's a survivor.

48:23.651 --> 48:25.319
Megatron, they got up out of here.

48:25.486 --> 48:27.988
I kicked more ass in prison.

48:28.989 --> 48:32.368
The end is near,
my old treacherous friend.

48:32.493 --> 48:33.536
She's coming!

48:33.661 --> 48:37.540
What a shame you'll be unable to see it.

48:41.377 --> 48:43.838
Come and get some, you little bitch!

48:58.352 --> 48:59.395
<i>Coming your way, Lennox.</i>

48:59.562 --> 49:01.230
We box these things in,
they will protect themselves.

49:01.397 --> 49:02.982
Yeah, we'll see.

49:06.861 --> 49:08.487
Tactical positions, let's go!

49:15.119 --> 49:17.163
You, too, knuckle-dragger.
Stay out of sight. Come on.

49:18.289 --> 49:20.082
Decepticons are coming.

49:20.166 --> 49:23.419
All right. We all know our hiding places.

49:23.502 --> 49:25.963
What's this?
The tracker brought them right to us.

49:26.046 --> 49:28.048
- When are you going to grow up?
- Dang it.

49:29.383 --> 49:32.803
<i>Target is four klicks away.
They just entered an abandoned town.</i>

49:53.532 --> 49:54.950
Let's go. Out! Out! Out! Out!

50:07.087 --> 50:08.172
Hey!

50:08.756 --> 50:10.508
Yeager's got vital intel. Detain only.

50:10.591 --> 50:13.344
Trf operation. Stay out of my way.

50:13.427 --> 50:15.095
Those were my men.

50:16.263 --> 50:18.641
Hey, there is some
scary shit going on out there.

50:18.724 --> 50:20.351
I'd like to at least keep my blaster.

50:20.434 --> 50:22.144
Not today. We're sticking to the plan.

50:22.269 --> 50:23.938
The whole town is wired and rigged.

50:24.104 --> 50:26.524
You! Sit down. Now. Stay put.

50:43.415 --> 50:46.001
Just a heads up.
We're probably going to jail,

50:46.126 --> 50:48.337
so try getting used to that.

50:51.340 --> 50:52.675
Here they come.

50:56.845 --> 50:58.138
Autobots, get ready.

50:58.347 --> 51:00.349
Hey, Cade, you mind if I bail?

51:00.516 --> 51:01.976
<i>Don't attack until I say.</i>

51:03.143 --> 51:05.813
Yeah, Decepticons is in the streets.

51:05.938 --> 51:08.315
- I feel a fight coming.
-L'ma kill y'all right now.

51:08.566 --> 51:09.984
Search this town.

51:10.484 --> 51:12.570
He's here.

51:12.653 --> 51:15.239
I'm letting y'all know
what we came to do.

51:18.492 --> 51:20.160
Get over here!

51:21.328 --> 51:24.164
Look at that little
blue beetle-looking mofo.

51:26.166 --> 51:27.626
Look at this little ugly dude.

51:27.793 --> 51:32.256
You are awash
in their repulsive scent. Disgusting.

51:33.007 --> 51:35.009
- Hey!
- Bee, stop her.

51:35.175 --> 51:37.136
Put him down!

51:37.303 --> 51:38.345
No. No, no, no, no.

51:38.429 --> 51:40.931
Here she go. Look at her,
walking all strong with pigtails.

51:41.015 --> 51:42.349
Go to hell!

51:42.516 --> 51:44.268
This planet is hell.

51:44.852 --> 51:46.854
What's that on your arm?

51:47.021 --> 51:49.356
- Put him down!
- Shit!

51:49.440 --> 51:51.025
You think I'm afraid of you, cabr√©n?

51:51.191 --> 51:53.193
- Hey, stop!
- Cade yeager.

51:53.277 --> 51:55.279
I need that talisman!

52:03.704 --> 52:05.372
We don't do this kamikaze shit.

52:05.539 --> 52:07.333
You wanna go out there
and start screaming at a decepticon?

52:07.499 --> 52:10.669
- Get those vile beings.
-L'm on 'em!

52:25.643 --> 52:27.019
Freeze!

52:35.027 --> 52:36.737
I got the leg!

52:37.112 --> 52:38.405
Gotcha!

52:39.740 --> 52:41.325
And his fat head.

52:41.408 --> 52:43.035
Don't get any better than that.

52:43.243 --> 52:44.495
Drift, now!

52:44.995 --> 52:47.498
Decepticons, retreat!

52:47.581 --> 52:48.582
Chickens!

52:50.918 --> 52:52.628
That plan went to shit.

52:56.507 --> 52:57.716
That's the only plan you got?

52:58.425 --> 52:59.802
Get down, get down, get down!

53:03.263 --> 53:05.349
- What are those?
- Trf.

53:06.433 --> 53:08.519
We gotta get inside. Come on. Run.

53:08.602 --> 53:10.270
This is supposed to hunt terrorists,

53:10.354 --> 53:11.772
not tax-paying Americans!

53:11.897 --> 53:13.232
Not that I pay taxes, but...

53:13.941 --> 53:16.276
Yo, Meg! M-tron!

53:16.610 --> 53:19.113
Stop playing. Come on.
Am I the only one in here?

53:23.951 --> 53:25.619
This ain't right.

53:32.626 --> 53:35.129
- We're safe in here.
- There's always one in charge.

53:35.212 --> 53:37.131
Just like back in Chicago, like a mother.

53:55.065 --> 53:55.941
Go, go, go!

53:57.651 --> 53:58.819
Run!

53:58.986 --> 54:00.070
Move, move, move!

54:07.661 --> 54:08.620
Hide in that room!

54:08.746 --> 54:09.830
Come on, come on, come on!

54:14.585 --> 54:15.878
I left the 'hood to not get shot

54:15.961 --> 54:17.296
and now I'm getting shot.

54:17.463 --> 54:19.298
This is the worst job ever.

54:19.465 --> 54:20.841
Does this job even have healthcare?

54:20.966 --> 54:22.176
It doesn't, do it?

54:22.342 --> 54:24.052
You try treating a bullet wound
by yourself.

54:24.762 --> 54:26.138
Watch out!

54:29.183 --> 54:30.350
Run! Run!

54:39.359 --> 54:40.778
Hide! Hide!

54:53.123 --> 54:54.875
<i>Facial mapping engaged-</i>

54:55.042 --> 54:56.210
you're a dead man.

55:11.350 --> 55:13.060
Shit. There's another one.

55:14.895 --> 55:17.523
- I got this.
- What are you doing?

55:17.648 --> 55:19.024
It's using facial recognition.

55:20.234 --> 55:21.568
Are you crazy?

55:22.569 --> 55:23.695
- Stay behind me.
- What?

55:23.862 --> 55:25.405
- Jimmy j, don't!
- I got this. Get behind me.

55:25.572 --> 55:26.740
- Don't do it.
- Get behind me.

55:26.907 --> 55:27.741
It's a bad idea!

55:29.243 --> 55:30.494
Shit.

55:32.913 --> 55:34.081
Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

55:38.752 --> 55:42.256
Cade, I just want to tell you,
i love you, man.

55:42.840 --> 55:43.841
What?

55:43.924 --> 55:45.801
This job wasn't what I thought,
but I appreciate everything.

55:45.968 --> 55:47.928
- What are you doing?
-L'm dying!

55:48.846 --> 55:49.930
It was only a beanbag, dude.

55:51.765 --> 55:52.766
There's no hole?

55:52.933 --> 55:54.351
There's no hole,
there's no blood, no nothing.

55:54.518 --> 55:55.894
- There's no hole.
- Will you get up?

55:56.061 --> 55:57.104
Stop trying to act like a hero.

55:57.271 --> 55:59.898
It was a beanbag?
That shit hurt like a bullet, man!

55:59.982 --> 56:00.941
I felt it go through me!

56:01.567 --> 56:03.277
Come on, that building right there!

56:09.408 --> 56:10.534
There's always one in charge!

56:10.617 --> 56:12.870
All right, we take out the big one,
we're gonna take them all out.

56:16.707 --> 56:18.917
Come on, come on, come on.
Hurry, hurry, they're coming.

56:22.337 --> 56:24.798
- Oh, my god! A leprechaun.
- Who the hell are you?

56:25.549 --> 56:27.593
Leprechauns are tiny, green and Irish,

56:27.676 --> 56:29.094
and that is offensive.

56:29.177 --> 56:31.054
What are you looking at, little girl?

56:31.221 --> 56:33.140
<i>What are you looking at?</i>

56:33.307 --> 56:36.268
Hello. Master Cade,
i have been sent to collect you.

56:36.435 --> 56:37.477
- Collect me?
- That is correct.

56:37.644 --> 56:38.979
You're not collecting shit.

56:43.650 --> 56:45.777
- Man! Slow down!
- So, you want to play rough.

56:51.116 --> 56:52.409
No! No! Cade!

56:53.076 --> 56:54.202
Shit!

56:54.745 --> 56:56.204
- Cade! Cade!
- Hold on!

57:01.335 --> 57:02.544
Did you see that? Hang on!

57:03.337 --> 57:04.504
Lam so clumsy!

57:04.671 --> 57:06.423
- Is he still alive?
- Hold on!

57:06.506 --> 57:08.050
Is he still living?

57:08.258 --> 57:10.052
No, he's going to die!

57:14.598 --> 57:15.933
My lord, this is not my fault,

57:16.016 --> 57:17.559
but he just burst out of the elevator.

57:18.060 --> 57:19.061
<i>Ten stories.</i>

57:19.144 --> 57:20.103
Oh, my god.

57:20.187 --> 57:21.480
<i>Did you have a backup plan, sir?</i>

57:21.563 --> 57:23.899
<i>- Did he</i> live?
<i>- I don't know! He just flew!</i>

57:36.370 --> 57:38.163
My lord, rip an arm off a human

57:38.246 --> 57:39.498
and they'll go wherever you want.

57:39.581 --> 57:40.582
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

58:17.369 --> 58:18.704
You little gnats.

58:19.579 --> 58:22.124
There you are. Good to find you alive!

58:22.249 --> 58:23.834
Just like nothing happened.

58:23.917 --> 58:26.461
- Let's make you presentable.
- Hey! Come on!

58:26.628 --> 58:28.296
Shiny, spic and span.

58:28.463 --> 58:29.589
- Back off, jeeves!
- There.

58:29.756 --> 58:31.717
- You look better already, sir.
- Who are you?

58:31.883 --> 58:34.886
My name is cogman, sir.
And I am here because of that.

58:35.095 --> 58:37.431
And that is here because of you.

58:37.764 --> 58:41.351
It will not leave you
until your quest is fulfilled.

58:42.728 --> 58:44.813
You have been chosen.

58:46.440 --> 58:47.524
What do you mean, "chosen"?

58:47.607 --> 58:49.860
I will explain everything
if you'll kindly come with me.

58:50.027 --> 58:52.362
Cade, what's with this c-3po rip-off?

58:52.446 --> 58:53.739
Don't kill the messenger

58:53.822 --> 58:55.824
or the messenger will kill you.

59:00.078 --> 59:02.664
Now then, I'm afraid all this ballyhoo
is on your account.

59:02.789 --> 59:06.126
If you want to save your friends,
you will leave them.

59:06.293 --> 59:07.419
Hey, don't talk to that leprechaun!

59:07.502 --> 59:09.296
What, and run off
with some crazy ninja Butler?

59:09.463 --> 59:11.506
Your friends will be safe
in your absence.

59:11.673 --> 59:13.967
In your presence, unsafe.

59:14.134 --> 59:17.971
You are more important
than you can possibly imagine.

59:18.472 --> 59:20.474
You are needed, sir.

59:20.807 --> 59:21.808
Urgently.

59:22.476 --> 59:24.311
My master is fond of saying

59:24.478 --> 59:26.104
that all the important decisions in life

59:26.188 --> 59:30.484
often come down to just one moment.

59:39.367 --> 59:41.787
You're gonna be all right.
You're family now.

59:41.870 --> 59:44.039
They're gonna take care of you,
i promise.

59:44.206 --> 59:46.666
The plane is waiting.
We are going to england.

59:46.833 --> 59:47.876
Bee?

59:49.211 --> 59:52.672
Listen up, little miss sunshine,
I'm in charge now.

59:53.340 --> 59:56.259
Just don't expect any bedtime stories.

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.143
<i>Welcome to air folgan.</i>

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:07.270
<i>Please strap in. Turbulence can kill.</i>

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:10.899
<i>There will be no snack service
on this flight, no drinks, no fun.</i>

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:13.735
Tracking yeager.
He's over the pond right now.

01:00:13.902 --> 01:00:16.113
It took some finding, but sats have him.

01:00:16.279 --> 01:00:17.864
Megatron and crew
are bearing down on the uk.

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:20.492
So is yeager. It's no coincidence.

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:24.871
I want you airborne with your team
to the uk asap.

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:30.502
Pick up. Pick up.

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:32.587
Yeah?

01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:33.880
<i>- Don't hang up!
-Lt's you again.</i>

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:36.550
<i>I've told you, you have nothing to offer.
Get lost.</i>

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:39.219
I need a favor, folgers.
I'd do it myself, but I can't.

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:40.387
You ever fly a Cuban airplane?

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.514
They're from the 1940s.
So are the pilots.

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:44.224
<i>Book of cyber-kells.</i>

01:00:44.391 --> 01:00:46.810
- I <i>found it.
- The ancient book? Impossible.</i>

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:49.187
Not when you know the right janitor.
And I know many.

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:51.565
The book exists. Unseen for centuries.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:54.359
Pages that literally dissolve
at room temperature,

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:57.863
made from some old
kind of goat scrotum or something.

01:00:57.946 --> 01:01:00.574
Trinity library. Today, 4:00 P.M.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:02.742
Be there if you want to know
how it all ends.

01:01:08.957 --> 01:01:12.919
<i>Object confirmed
as exoplanet cybertron.</i>

01:01:13.879 --> 01:01:16.840
<i>Two days, seven hours to impact.</i>

01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:24.931
<i>Optimus, it is time you knew the truth.</i>

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:27.017
<i>The place you call earth</i>

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:31.104
has another name. Unicron.

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:34.941
Earth... unicron?

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:38.820
Cybertron's ancient enemy.

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:40.614
Yes.

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:42.949
You are going to kill him.

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:47.621
With my staff,
we will drain the very life from unicron.

01:01:48.288 --> 01:01:51.291
- Earth will die...
- Yes.

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:54.169
And your world will be reborn,

01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:56.713
Nemesis prime.

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:02.761
I will fight anyone who stands in my way.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.264
<i>The alien horns are still growing,</i>

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:08.934
<i>some of them reaching 400 meters.</i>

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:11.645
More alien rubbish.

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:13.813
Have you found a man yet, viviane?

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.649
- No.
- So sad.

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:17.025
You should really look in here.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:20.028
I mean, there are lots of adverts,
some of them very tempting.

01:02:20.195 --> 01:02:22.656
This one's looking for a bbw.
I don't know what that is.

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:24.157
- It's a car, dear.
- Right.

01:02:24.324 --> 01:02:25.533
Big beautiful woman.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.327
Is it? Who knew?

01:02:27.494 --> 01:02:29.162
Looking at the classifieds!

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:31.373
This one's got its own dungeon.

01:02:31.539 --> 01:02:33.667
Great! I love dungeons!

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:35.669
See, that's perfect for you, isn't it?

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.545
All that old stuff, you'd love that.

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:39.965
History is being rewritten
and you want to talk about a man.

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:41.341
Or a woman.

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:42.884
Aunt Helen.

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:44.469
"Women seeking women." Here we go.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:47.806
You could ask me about my work.

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:49.307
Why would we do that?

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:51.810
I mean, it's just dusty old books.

01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:53.436
Now I welcome the end of days!

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.815
What's so terrible about me wanting you
to have what I had with your father?

01:02:56.982 --> 01:02:58.191
He was an ass.

01:02:58.358 --> 01:02:59.734
Do you know what father didn't have?

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:01.945
The one thing that his beloved
knights of the round table

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:04.072
had in spades
and he was utterly lacking?

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:05.949
<i>Honor.</i>

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:07.575
You can say that again.

01:03:07.659 --> 01:03:10.537
If you can stop loathing
a dead man long enough,

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.080
you might want to have a look
in his study.

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:13.206
All that rubbish.

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:14.833
<i>There might be something
you want to keep.</i>

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:41.484
Do not touch that!

01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:44.029
Sorry, daddy.

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:47.615
I don't want anything.

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:49.534
Tell the university to take the lot.

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:00.211
"The 12th Earl of folgan

01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:02.422
"urgently requests your presence

01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:03.590
"this very moment."

01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:12.766
Stop!

01:04:20.815 --> 01:04:22.484
Move! Move!

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:24.611

<i>- What?
- Je m'appelle hot rod.</i>

01:04:36.915 --> 01:04:38.625
Christ alive, you're one of them!

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:41.294
Back! Be quiet! Do not hit me again!

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.096
So, which bloody bot are you, then?

01:04:51.262 --> 01:04:53.098
Soundwave? Shockwave?

01:04:53.181 --> 01:04:56.309
At least tell me that I've been abducted
by one of the famous ones.

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:58.520
I am so much better than all of them!

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:00.230
Help! I'm being kidnapped!

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:02.690
<i>Mademoiselle, sit</i> down!

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:05.402
Help! Yes, yes, hello!

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:06.986
Hello, lamborghini!

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:08.655
Would you help?

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:11.157
Sorry, i'vejust been kidnap... nuts!

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.501
I love this car!

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:39.519
The white cliffs of Dover.

01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:53.199
That's a good girl. Good girl.

01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:01.249
Good girl. Come on. There's a good girl.

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:21.019
We have guests!

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:22.812
What's the matter with you?

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:24.731
Shit! My bits are falling off.

01:06:24.898 --> 01:06:25.940
Idiot!

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:28.401
Hello there!

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:30.737
<i>What the hell?</i>

01:06:31.863 --> 01:06:33.907
- Good girl.
- Master, he's a complete knucklehead.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.576
I'm awfully sorry about that, but you see,

01:06:36.951 --> 01:06:41.247
he thinks it's still the year 1918 or 1914.
Something like that.

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:42.373
So sad.

01:06:42.457 --> 01:06:44.042
World war I and all that stuff.

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:46.711
I mean... battle of the marne,
battle of the somme,

01:06:46.794 --> 01:06:48.254
battle of the marne,
battle of passchendaele.

01:06:48.463 --> 01:06:50.882
Trenches and mud and death

01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:52.759
and Gore and all that. It's terribly sad.

01:06:52.926 --> 01:06:55.261
"It's a long way to tipperary,
it's a long way to go."

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:57.847
Yeah, but it's... it's terrible!

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:00.683
I mean, so sad, you know?
But then, I mean...

01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:03.436
Isn't it? I mean, this late onset of, well...

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:06.105
Robot dementia.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:07.774
It's not at all pretty.

01:07:09.651 --> 01:07:11.819
I don't know what you're smoking
in that pipe, man, but...

01:07:12.028 --> 01:07:13.780
What's going on here?

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:16.032
Did you drag me to some
transformer retirement home?

01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:17.951
Look, somebody better start talking,
or I'm outta here.

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:19.702
Okay.

01:07:19.786 --> 01:07:20.787
Bumblebee?

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:23.122
We only met when
i was a little boy in short pants.

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:24.457
I must have been that tall.

01:07:24.624 --> 01:07:27.126
Maybe taller.
Or maybe shorter, I can't remember.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:29.629
- But never forget a face.
- Bee, you know this guy?

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:30.797
<i>I don't...With you.</i>

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:31.881
Yes.

01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:33.550
Let's have a look at this thing.

01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:35.134
Please. Very interesting.

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:37.387
Yes.

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:41.808
You keep a secret for so long,
knowing it to be true,

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:43.768
and yet, deep down inside,

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:46.145
you begin to wonder,

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:48.982
"has my life been wasted?"

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:51.818
Have you ever felt like that, Mr. Cade?

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:55.405
It's just Cade.

01:07:55.572 --> 01:07:58.157
Look, old timer, I don't have
a ton of Patience for riddles right now.

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:01.578
Yes, but you want to know,
don't you, "dude",

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:04.038
why they keep coming here.

01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:07.500
To earth. Right?

01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:13.256
I do so love perfect timing.

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:18.344
What a bitchin' car she is!

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:28.229
No, no, no, little lady.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:30.857
<i>Why do you have to
be</i> like <i>that? Pourquoi?</i>

01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:34.527
So, is this a kidnapping sort of situation

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:36.696
or her first transformer experience?

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:37.863
It's both, really.

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:39.907
Do not hit me again!

01:08:40.073 --> 01:08:43.661
But she does have a rather nice
fight-or-flight response.

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:46.913
She's very difficult.

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:51.044
<i>My name is Edmond Burton,
12th Earl of folgan.</i>

01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:54.296
Last surviving member
of the order of the witwiccans.

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:57.550
What's up?

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.350
Does he have to loom like that?

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:11.731
<i>‚ÄúU'&‚Äú what'?</i>

01:09:13.358 --> 01:09:14.108
<i>‚ÄúUk rut‚Äú?</i>

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.319
Hot rod.

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:19.863
- It's his French accent.
-Ls he French?

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:21.573
No, he just likes the accent.

01:09:21.741 --> 01:09:24.993
No, no, no! I hate the accent!
But I can't get rid of it.

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:27.037
I'm stuck with the accent.

01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:28.413
He's a soldier, miss viviane.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:31.501
He swore an oath to your father
to protect you.

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:33.795
Some dad you got there.

01:09:33.877 --> 01:09:35.587
That is a nice ride.
I mean, you can roll right up

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:36.756
to Buckingham Palace in that thing.

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:39.425
Okay, you, American man, shut it.

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:42.095
What am I doing here?

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.555
- Yeah, why is she here?
-Lntroductions.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.265
Miss viviane wembly.
Master of history, Oxford.

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:49.102
Doctor of philosophy, also Oxford.

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:52.063
And doctor of letters,
again Oxford, I think. Anything else?

01:09:52.145 --> 01:09:53.689
Anyway, meet Cade.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.441
Yeager.

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:57.944
Cade yeager. I'm an inventor.

01:09:58.111 --> 01:09:59.445
You're an inventor.

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:01.322
- Yes, I am.
- What have you invented?

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:03.408
- A lot of things.
- Like?

01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:05.952
Like a lot of things. Like...

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.954
- Things that you've heard of.
- Like?

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:09.414
Well, things that you will
have heard of, okay?

01:10:09.497 --> 01:10:10.623
Patents are pending.

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:16.838
Don't say that. What's "ah"?

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:18.339
You know, I could do that, too.
"I'm English,

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:19.757
"and I'm too cool for feelings."

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:21.300
What, I've come here to be insulted

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:24.303
by some over-educated ivory-tower
Princess in a stripper dress?

01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:25.722
Stripper?

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:28.599
Well, only in America
is a finer education an insult.

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:30.476
And if my dress
makes you feel uncomfortable,

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:32.103
then maybe I could take it off.

01:10:32.812 --> 01:10:33.813
Okay.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.982
That's enough!

01:10:36.816 --> 01:10:38.818
What's your problem? No, no, no!

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:40.570
C09 man?

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:43.072
Shall I take his head off, madam?

01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:46.492
Tempting,
but I can defend my own honor.

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:50.037
But I do so very much want
to crush his windpipe.

01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:53.750
Control, cogman.
You must learn to control that impulse.

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:55.877
Channel it into other things.

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:58.171
Yes, my lord.

01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:02.008
Like making beds or cooking food.

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:06.888
Polishing the silver. I am trying, my lord.

01:11:07.054 --> 01:11:09.849
He is a "headmaster".
A very rare breed.

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:11.768
That dude is disturbed, yeah?

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:14.187
Like, seriously evil.
Like, split personality.

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.563
Good.

01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:20.151
Cogman? Glass 17c is missing.
Did you break it?

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:22.737
I've been a Butler for
the aristocracy for 700 years.

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:25.156
You are the worst I've ever worked for!

01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:26.824
These were all my predecessors.

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:29.535
They're all folgans.
And that was my aunt there.

01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:31.329
My great-great-great-great aunt.

01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:33.164
She poisoned my great-great-great
uncle for some reason.

01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:35.124
She was barking mad,
she was an absolute bitch.

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:37.376
There's my grandfather
over there, aloysius.

01:11:37.543 --> 01:11:39.212
And that's Arnold, my third cousin.

01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:41.756
He drunk sewage water,
committed suicide. He was quite mad.

01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:43.674
They were all mad, really.

01:11:43.841 --> 01:11:45.134
There's bullet holes.

01:11:47.678 --> 01:11:49.055
No, no. Nasty critter.

01:11:49.263 --> 01:11:50.890
No,no,no,no,no.

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:54.227
That's the watch that killed Hitler.
Don't screw with it.

01:11:55.269 --> 01:11:58.064
These are all the witwiccans.

01:11:58.231 --> 01:12:00.149
In our halcyon days
we were quite the club.

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:03.402
Brilliant minds, explorers, scientists,
artists, world leaders.

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:05.029
Renaissance thrill seekers.

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:07.073
People like Catherine the great,
empress of all Russia,

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:07.907
general Washington,

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:09.408
William Shakespeare,
queen Elizabeth of england,

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:10.618
Abraham Lincoln, Frederick douglass,

01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:12.203
Harriet tubman, the Wright brothers,

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:14.080
giotto, Michelangelo, Darwin,
Churchill, Einstein,

01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:16.582
Stephen Hawking, Henry v,
Leonardo Da Vinci,

01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:18.626
Newton, de lavoisier, Mozart,
Beethoven, mahler,

01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:21.254
Edmund Hillary, Teddy Roosevelt,
copernicus,

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.256
Tesla, Galileo.

01:12:23.422 --> 01:12:25.550
They all belonged to a secret society,
you see.

01:12:25.716 --> 01:12:26.968
All united in one cause.

01:12:27.134 --> 01:12:30.137
To protect the secret history
of transformers.

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:33.099
Here. On earth.

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:36.185
Now, this is the witwiccan family tree.

01:12:36.894 --> 01:12:38.938
Merlin, Viviana.

01:12:39.105 --> 01:12:41.107
Goes back 40 generations.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.693
Go over to that desk.
There's a photograph there.

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:45.778
Your father was a member.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:48.781
He very much wanted to tell you that.

01:12:50.658 --> 01:12:53.035
And my own family had some...

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:57.707
Small part in all this.

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:00.251
Zb-7.

01:13:00.418 --> 01:13:01.711
That looks just like bee.

01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:04.338
It is. He was attached
to the devil's brigade.

01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:06.507
Pretty vicious military unit.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.676
<i>Helped turn the tide of war, you know?</i>

01:13:19.937 --> 01:13:21.272
We're not invited.

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:51.010
- Bee?
- Yeah.

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:52.094
But he's so nice.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:55.389
Behind the lines, during the war,
they called him many things.

01:13:55.473 --> 01:13:57.516
"Nice" was never one of them.

01:13:58.059 --> 01:14:00.186
It all began in 484 ad,

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:03.189
when king Arthur and his wizard, Merlin,

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:06.442
stared down and vanquished
the Saxon hordes at mount badon.

01:14:06.525 --> 01:14:09.195
That's his sword and his mace there.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:11.072
It's a myth.

01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:12.657
Yeah, every legend, every myth,

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.201
every story
whispered around the campfire

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:16.911
has a logical explanation.

01:14:16.994 --> 01:14:19.956
With that I agree wholeheartedly,
but logic has left the building.

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.624
You're talking about magic.

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:24.126
What, like your walking,
talking lamborghini?

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:27.463
"Any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic."

01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:29.507
Arthur c. Clarke. Impressive.

01:14:29.674 --> 01:14:31.717
Yeah. And count 'em,
zero student loans,

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:34.553
doctor, or professor, philosopher,
whatever you call yourself.

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:37.056
It's all of the above.

01:14:42.269 --> 01:14:43.688
Now, this place was built

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:47.274
around the original round table.

01:14:47.358 --> 01:14:50.903
Percival, gawain, Tristan, Lancelot.

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:56.492
<i>They sat right here.</i>

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.454
<i>Twelve in all.</i>

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:05.251
<i>And behind them sat the 12
who came from cybertron.</i>

01:15:10.965 --> 01:15:12.675
We fight for honor.

01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:16.012
We fight for the human race.

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:18.180
For all that is good in mankind.

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:21.726
To brothers old and brothers new!

01:15:22.226 --> 01:15:25.354
To brothers old and brothers new!

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:36.532
No sacrifice, no victory!

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:40.286
Twelve alien knights
who saw in Camelot

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.955
what the human race could be
at its finest.

01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:44.832
A race of honor.

01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:55.968
C09 man?

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:58.304
You ruined the moment again!

01:15:58.471 --> 01:16:01.015
I was making the moment more epic.

01:16:01.182 --> 01:16:02.433
Just be quiet.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:04.268
What's the matter with you?

01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:06.062
If I could find his neck, I'd strangle him.

01:16:06.854 --> 01:16:09.106
This belonged to king Arthur himself.

01:16:10.274 --> 01:16:13.486
Now, legend held that one last knight
would someday be chosen

01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:16.906
<i>and the struggle
to save the world would begin.</i>

01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:19.158
It would appear, Mr. Cade,

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.787
that that last knight is you.

01:16:25.372 --> 01:16:26.373
What?

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:28.542
You're saying he traveled
the whole universe to find me?

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:30.294
No, not you specifically.

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:31.921
Not a failed inventor
from the state of Texas.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:32.838
No, god forbid.

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:35.633
Stop it!

01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:37.802
What?

01:16:38.677 --> 01:16:39.970
You know, if you don't stop it,

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:42.765
I will send you back to cybertron
in a little tiny box.

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:43.849
Scary.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:45.392
I am not a failed inventor.

01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:48.521
No, he meant the qualities
of a knight, Mr. Cade.

01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:51.732
Miss viviane, the qualities of a knight,
if you please?

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:56.028
Qualities of a knight, purity of heart,
valor, honor, virtue, integrity.

01:16:56.195 --> 01:16:57.196
I have those.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:58.322
And most importantly...

01:16:58.489 --> 01:17:00.533
-Ls he chaste?
- Chased?

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:02.326
Dude, I was getting chased
when your little weirdo buddy

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:03.410
brought me over here on the plane.

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.121
"Chaste".

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:06.747
C-h-a-s-t-e.

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:08.040
Iitii-

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:09.166
celibate?

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.668
Yeah, I know... l was making a joke.

01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:12.086
You don't think I know how to spell?

01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:13.963
- I know what he meant.
- Sure you were.

01:17:14.171 --> 01:17:15.673
No whoopee, Mr. Cade?

01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:18.384
It's been a while.

01:17:18.551 --> 01:17:21.220
Well, how long's "a while"? A week?
A month? A year?

01:17:21.387 --> 01:17:22.763
None of your business.

01:17:22.888 --> 01:17:24.306
Well, we need to ask you the question.

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:26.350
Awhile!

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:29.478
What is this?

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:30.563
Is that, like, another English thing?

01:17:30.729 --> 01:17:33.065
No, no. Just a curious thing.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:34.400
Well, maybe I'm saving myself.

01:17:34.567 --> 01:17:36.235
What are you saving yourself for,
old age?

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:37.820
You, English lady, shut it.

01:17:40.156 --> 01:17:42.408
What is this? Some sort of a map?

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:44.493
This table is from cybertron.

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:47.705
It's a puzzle I've been working on
for some time.

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:48.873
My entire life, actually.

01:17:49.582 --> 01:17:51.750
And what do these glyphs say about it?

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:53.210
They're olde cybertronian.

01:17:53.961 --> 01:17:56.797
A mantra whispered
through the cosmos.

01:17:59.884 --> 01:18:01.427
Wait a minute.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:02.970
I heard that before.

01:18:04.471 --> 01:18:07.099
A knight on a ship. What does it mean?

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:10.186
"With your dying breath,
protect the staff."

01:18:11.437 --> 01:18:13.355
Okay, this is ridiculous.

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:20.112
They had their name for it.

01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:22.114
We have ours.

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:24.366
<i>The staff of Merlin.</i>

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:28.913
<i>Bequeathed to him by an alien race.
Fused with his DNA.</i>

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:32.708
So that only he would have the key
to unlock its alien power.

01:18:33.792 --> 01:18:36.128
Or as they knew it in those days,

01:18:36.670 --> 01:18:37.963
magic.

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:43.594
<i>The staff was buried with Merlin's body.</i>

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:46.138
A thousand years we've kept it hidden.

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:49.099
If it ever fell into the wrong hands,
it would mean

01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:53.604
the imminent destruction
of everything we know and love.

01:18:53.812 --> 01:18:57.942
The 12 guardian knights combined
into a mighty dragon to protect it.

01:18:58.025 --> 01:19:00.194
And now it is in great danger.

01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:02.905
Megatron. He was after this.

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:04.573
So the battle is upon us.

01:19:04.657 --> 01:19:06.408
It is why they're here,
why they keep coming to earth.

01:19:06.533 --> 01:19:09.078
And we must claim the staff
before it is too late.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:10.704
Wait. We what?

01:19:10.788 --> 01:19:13.832
Only a direct descendant
of Merlin himself

01:19:14.375 --> 01:19:17.378
can wield this instrument
of absolute power.

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:20.422
And you, miss viviane,

01:19:20.506 --> 01:19:23.676
are Merlin's last descendant
here on earth, and as such,

01:19:23.842 --> 01:19:25.678
you are our last hope.

01:19:25.844 --> 01:19:27.429
Okay, wait. Go back.

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:29.932
You're saying that I'm related
to the wizard Merlin?

01:19:36.313 --> 01:19:37.398
Bit of a shock, isn't it?

01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:42.194
Only you know the staff's location,
imparted to you by your father.

01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:45.197
He had to leave a clue, didn't he?

01:19:45.739 --> 01:19:46.865
Are you sure?

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.034
She doesn't have that
"i know where the staff is" look.

01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:51.870
Listen, the only thing
that my father imparted to me

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:53.497
was to get out of his study.

01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:55.958
"Two worlds colliding,
only one survives."

01:19:56.041 --> 01:19:59.211
Your words exactly.
Only lecture time is over.

01:19:59.336 --> 01:20:01.714
You were born for this.

01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:04.675
This is the latest image
of their world coming here.

01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:07.177
And you're all that stand in its way.

01:20:07.344 --> 01:20:08.846
So you'd better find that staff quickly.

01:20:08.929 --> 01:20:09.930
Now!

01:20:10.931 --> 01:20:11.932
<i>Trf.</i>

01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:13.559
<i>Surround the castle and lock it down.</i>

01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:19.398
MI6 and trf are here!

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:21.233
Move it! Go!

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.444
Cogman, get me to London, okay?

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:28.615
- The decoy car is ready?
- Hurry along.

01:20:31.577 --> 01:20:33.454
<i>L</i> got 'em, bgys!

01:20:37.374 --> 01:20:39.918
Hurry, move! Quick, quick, quick!

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:41.920
Get us out of here, bee.

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:46.258
Get out of here!
My weapon will stop the time!

01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:02.649
Einstein would've been
tickled pink. Foo-foo!

01:21:05.361 --> 01:21:07.738
Quick, this way, this way! Hurry!

01:21:07.821 --> 01:21:10.115
Shotgun. I call shotgun.

01:21:18.665 --> 01:21:20.626
<i>Inbound helos, you are clear to land.</i>

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:23.962
<i>Colonel Lennox just hit the deck.</i>

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:27.800
This is Santos, team leader usa.
What you got?

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:33.555
<i>Trf airship on the way.</i>

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:42.272
Meet me around back, bee.

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:46.026
I suck at this game!

01:21:46.193 --> 01:21:48.028
When you bite your nails,
you give everything away.

01:21:48.195 --> 01:21:49.696
Mum?

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:52.866
Everybody, this is Cade.

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:55.327
Cade, this is my family.

01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:56.495
Hello!

01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:58.122
- Hi.
- Cade?

01:21:58.288 --> 01:21:59.665
Hello. I'm Marie.

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:00.999
Do you have a dungeon?

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:03.210
Oh, my goodness!
Hands like rough old maple.

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:04.670
He looks hard as wood.

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:07.172
Don't touch him.
I'm gonna go and get changed.

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:10.592
I got a call from a very irate janitor
at Trinity library.

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.511
<i>You're late.</i>

01:22:12.678 --> 01:22:14.221
<i>We are, as they say, in a bit of a pickle.</i>

01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:15.764
Do not mess with me at this moment!

01:22:15.848 --> 01:22:18.350
It's hot, and I am on a short fuse.

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:23.063
Quick! Get to the library!

01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:24.731
This chasing is stressing me out.

01:22:28.735 --> 01:22:31.321
Ml6 and trf are gonna find us.
We got to hurry.

01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:33.198
My dad had a lot of stuff.

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.535
So, finding the staff's location...

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:38.245
What does that mean?
We're looking for, like, what?

01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:40.080
Like, a map, or a letter, or books, or...

01:22:40.164 --> 01:22:42.916
Holy shit! It'll take a year
to find something in here.

01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:45.461
I don't know where to find
this bloody staff.

01:22:45.544 --> 01:22:48.172
Look at this little fake horse.
Probably stuffed in its butt or something.

01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:49.298
Guys do stupid stuff like that.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:52.843
What is going on up there?

01:22:54.261 --> 01:22:55.721
You checking behind pictures?

01:22:55.888 --> 01:22:56.722
Just rip it. Rip it apart!

01:22:57.764 --> 01:22:59.683
Just grab it. Hurry, let's make this quick.

01:22:59.766 --> 01:23:00.851
This is exciting.

01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:03.437
- I can't get it out.
- Great.

01:23:03.604 --> 01:23:06.607
Oh, my god. Such a hoarder.

01:23:09.401 --> 01:23:10.944
It's like having Tarzan in the house.

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:12.362
Slow down.

01:23:13.947 --> 01:23:15.449
- L'm gonna take a peek.
- No!

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:18.243
Come on, come on.
Answer me, come on!

01:23:20.913 --> 01:23:22.372
<i>Damn you, tell me where it is!</i>

01:23:22.456 --> 01:23:25.626
Not so fast. I want in.

01:23:26.585 --> 01:23:28.670
To be a witwiccan,
you have to be a special person.

01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:30.130
You, sir, are not.

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:32.758
Read me into the club and I'll tell you.
Right here, now.

01:23:32.925 --> 01:23:35.969
Over the phone?
That is absolutely barbaric.

01:23:36.136 --> 01:23:37.930
Over the phone. Do it, englishman!

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:41.433
As the 12th Earl of folgan,
by the power imbued

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:42.684
<i>by his majesty king Arthur</i>

01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:44.645
<i>and his league of knights
of the round table,</i>

01:23:44.728 --> 01:23:46.939
<i>I now Grant you,
Seymour rutherford Simmons...</i>

01:23:47.105 --> 01:23:49.483
- Entrance into...
-"Admittance", not "entrance"!

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:50.901
Don't try to snooker me. Get it right.

01:23:51.068 --> 01:23:53.779
Enough,enough,enough.
Just tell me! Now!

01:23:55.072 --> 01:23:56.949
Shut up! "Shh" yourselves.

01:23:58.116 --> 01:23:59.618
What's the matter with you all?

01:23:59.785 --> 01:24:00.619
Stack six, row c.

01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:03.455
Hurry, man, they're dissolving scrotums.
Let's go.

01:24:03.622 --> 01:24:05.457
I'm going! I'm going!
It's very confusing talking to you.

01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:06.500
Come on, old man, get there!

01:24:06.667 --> 01:24:08.252
Come on, Simmons,
you said no work today.

01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:10.754
Let's get your pale-ass legs
and go to the beach.

01:24:10.837 --> 01:24:13.340
I'm working here, all right?
Five minutes, I swear!

01:24:13.507 --> 01:24:15.801
You always say five minutes.
That means no.

01:24:15.968 --> 01:24:18.637
Just go get Rodrigo and Julio
and get the game started.

01:24:18.762 --> 01:24:19.930
I hate Rodrigo.

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:21.390
I'll set and bump with you in 10 minutes.

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:23.183
Okay, come on,
I'm in the middle of something.

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.976
Okay, back.

01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:27.646
<i>They knew way back in the dark ages
where the end would begin.</i>

01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:30.023
There is cybertron and there is earth.

01:24:30.107 --> 01:24:31.733
Only they don't call it earth at all,
they never did.

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:32.985
<i>They called it something else.</i>

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:35.404
<i>One will suck the other dry,</i>

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:38.490
a giant succubus,
until only one remains.

01:24:41.034 --> 01:24:42.327
Earth is unicron.

01:24:42.869 --> 01:24:46.248
One day his horns will rise to fight
the mad goddess quintessa.

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:50.377
<i>She will end our planet
to resurrect her own.</i>

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:52.671
Let's go. Hurry!

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:53.964
- My lord.
- Cogman, go!

01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:56.800
<i>- Tell me where it goes down.</i>
- I <i>just dropped it to you.</i>

01:24:56.883 --> 01:24:58.844
<i>The horns are the key to the location.</i>

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:00.554
<i>Why are they spread out
all over the earth</i>

01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:01.888
<i>in a jumble? The answer, they aren't.</i>

01:25:02.055 --> 01:25:04.683
Time and mother nature
pulled them apart.

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:06.143
That's pangaea. The supercontinent.

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:07.978
<i>It's the same shape on the round table.</i>

01:25:08.145 --> 01:25:09.229
Take a gander, folgers,

01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:12.399
at what's smack in the center
of that perfect circle.

01:25:12.566 --> 01:25:14.568
- Genius!
- That's stonehenge!

01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:16.486
One of the greatest mysteries
of the ages.

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:18.196
No one understood its purpose
until now.

01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:21.116
- No one. Except me.
- That's where it all begins.

01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:23.201
You're the man behind the man.
Do something.

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:25.203
<i>I'll handle it, brother Simmons, fear not.</i>

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:26.330
I never had a brother.

01:25:28.206 --> 01:25:29.541
Feels nice.

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:31.209
Beach time! Ready?

01:25:36.173 --> 01:25:37.966
"Viviane followed Merlin."

01:25:39.009 --> 01:25:40.344
What does that mean?

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:41.803
My secret cupboard!

01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:48.477
Okay, 0k8)'-

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:50.020
"viviane followed Merlin."

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:53.106
Only Merlin could wield the magic staff.

01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:55.942
Merlin and little girls, of course.

01:26:00.697 --> 01:26:02.699
Navy museum,
that's got to be where the staff is.

01:26:02.908 --> 01:26:04.701
It was in my hands all along.

01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:09.790
Alpha team, go, go, 90-

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:13.168
- British trf!
- Come on!

01:26:14.544 --> 01:26:15.754
I surrender.

01:26:17.089 --> 01:26:19.758
My lord, trf is on our tail.

01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:21.802
Why'd you park
the decoy car so far away?

01:26:21.927 --> 01:26:23.136
You are a fusspot!

01:26:24.554 --> 01:26:26.473
Good. Don't let us get caught, cogman.

01:26:27.766 --> 01:26:29.267
My speciality, my lord.

01:26:47.619 --> 01:26:49.287
Damn! You don't have to kill people.

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:57.796
Get out of the way!

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:02.259
Which reminds me, Agnes called.

01:27:02.426 --> 01:27:05.220
Wondered if you're available
for a bit of a snuggle this evening.

01:27:05.887 --> 01:27:08.014
I'd love a snuggle with Agnes.
Do I look available?

01:27:19.067 --> 01:27:20.819
- Move, bitch! Get out of my way!
- Kamikaze pilot!

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:23.071
Move, bitch! Get out of my way!

01:27:23.989 --> 01:27:25.657
- Hello. Yes.
- Navy museum.

01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:29.369
Royal Navy museum. I knew it!

01:27:34.958 --> 01:27:36.209
<i>Bee, I'm gonna divert the cops!</i>

01:27:40.046 --> 01:27:41.339
<i>A decepticon has been seen...</i>

01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:42.632
What do you mean, decepticon?

01:27:44.384 --> 01:27:46.094
- Here's where it gets intense.
- More intense?

01:27:58.482 --> 01:27:59.399
Bee?

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:07.866
Goddamn, they're all around us

01:28:08.033 --> 01:28:09.701
and I just have so much road rage!

01:28:09.868 --> 01:28:11.620
Actualize the rage. That's it!

01:28:13.538 --> 01:28:15.165
You want some?

01:28:17.584 --> 01:28:19.711
Cogman, blast them!

01:28:31.765 --> 01:28:33.558
Good boy.

01:28:35.477 --> 01:28:37.020
It's a one-way street!

01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:38.563
I'm not driving. He's driving.

01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:42.567
No!

01:28:47.239 --> 01:28:48.573
- Bee, head right, haul ass!
- Go!

01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:05.715
<i>That's how you get to the big leagues.</i>

01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:10.011
That hurt.

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:13.223
What the hell?
You are out of your mind!

01:29:18.061 --> 01:29:19.229
- Did we lose them?
- Hey, stop!

01:29:19.396 --> 01:29:20.772
- You didn't pay!
- Sorry.

01:29:20.939 --> 01:29:23.275
It's all right, I've got them!
They just love submarines.

01:29:25.777 --> 01:29:26.736
They're a bit rude.

01:29:26.903 --> 01:29:28.947
Yes, they are, aren't they?
That's the modern generation.

01:29:29.155 --> 01:29:32.450
And this museum is closed for eternity.

01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:34.619
All you boys and girls, off the sub now!

01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:37.539
Off the sub now! Move, move, move!

01:29:37.747 --> 01:29:39.916
Go on, push! Move your fat ass!
Push! Squeeze!

01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:41.001
Go, go, go!

01:29:42.002 --> 01:29:43.628
This thing isn't gonna run.

01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:48.049
The mission's in deep,
unexplored waters.

01:29:48.133 --> 01:29:49.801
It's wonderful!

01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:52.679
And the sour-sweet musk of men
in close quarters.

01:29:52.804 --> 01:29:54.639
It's quite disgusting, really.

01:29:54.806 --> 01:29:56.141
But now this,

01:29:56.308 --> 01:29:58.310
the greatest mission of them all,

01:29:58.393 --> 01:30:00.812
one that I have longed for
my entire life...

01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:05.650
To help turn the tide
of human history, you know?

01:30:08.695 --> 01:30:10.196
Now, alas,

01:30:11.531 --> 01:30:13.199
I can no longer join you.

01:30:14.534 --> 01:30:17.621
But, my lord, you have been waiting
for this moment for 71 years.

01:30:17.704 --> 01:30:20.707
I know, I know, but I'm not
knighthood material, I'm afraid.

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:22.375
And...

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:24.419
You have your mission, and I have mine.

01:30:24.502 --> 01:30:27.172
Oh, no, no.
You are not leaving us in this tin can

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:29.424
with that four-foot mental psychopath.
I don't think so.

01:30:29.507 --> 01:30:31.509
I prefer the word "sociopath".

01:30:31.676 --> 01:30:33.678
Mr. Cade, everything you've done
in your life,

01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:35.847
your pain and your suffering,

01:30:35.931 --> 01:30:38.308
the loss of your wife,
separation from your daughter,

01:30:38.391 --> 01:30:39.684
your financial difficulties,

01:30:39.768 --> 01:30:43.855
it's all just been
a journey to this very moment.

01:30:46.483 --> 01:30:47.943
You talk a lot.

01:30:49.319 --> 01:30:51.404
Yeah, I suppose I do.

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:53.365
My dear,

01:30:54.824 --> 01:30:57.577
your <i>father left the alliance</i> to <i>you,</i>

01:30:57.661 --> 01:30:58.870
for you alone.

01:30:59.037 --> 01:31:00.914
She knows the way to the staff.

01:31:01.081 --> 01:31:03.083
Good luck to both of you.

01:31:04.376 --> 01:31:06.378
It won't be the strangest thing
I've done today.

01:31:10.465 --> 01:31:12.092
Hope the old girl's still got it.

01:31:19.224 --> 01:31:20.392
Good luck!

01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:27.023
Okay. I didn't do that.

01:31:28.233 --> 01:31:29.275
Jumped? What do you mean, jumped?

01:31:29.359 --> 01:31:31.611
The old world war ll sub
jumped its moorings.

01:31:31.778 --> 01:31:33.071
They're in a transformer.

01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:44.290
- Can I get a look?
- No, I'm looking.

01:31:44.582 --> 01:31:46.209
Will you move?

01:31:46.292 --> 01:31:48.086
God, get out of the way, man!
Ls that water?

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:50.672
- No shit, Sherlock.
- Obviously, it's water.

01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:51.756
Do you know how to operate it?

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:52.924
You know how to operate it, right?

01:31:53.008 --> 01:31:54.467
He says you're in charge of this now.

01:31:54.884 --> 01:31:56.761
- Let me see. Let me see.
- Don't touch me again!

01:31:56.845 --> 01:31:58.179
Don't freak me out.

01:31:58.263 --> 01:32:00.515
What happens in the alien ship
stays in the alien ship.

01:32:00.765 --> 01:32:02.726
I will eff you up!

01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:06.438
<i>Surface, I have positive surface contact.</i>

01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:07.939
<i>Track number 5205.</i>

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:09.357
The sub must be heading
for open water,

01:32:09.441 --> 01:32:10.775
directly towards our strike group.

01:32:10.942 --> 01:32:11.901
Okay, we have to cut 'em off. Stop 'em.

01:32:11.985 --> 01:32:13.111
Use whatever assets we have.

01:32:13.236 --> 01:32:14.320
Contact the zulu module.

01:32:14.821 --> 01:32:16.114
Have all our subs
converge on that chokepoint.

01:32:16.489 --> 01:32:18.324
<i>Helm, all ahead flank.</i>

01:32:20.243 --> 01:32:23.580
Conn, sonar. Alien contact,
bearing 150, range 1,000 yards.

01:32:23.747 --> 01:32:25.457
Contact bearing 150.

01:32:31.129 --> 01:32:33.882
We need to get seal teams in dsvs.
We need to chase 'em.

01:32:38.053 --> 01:32:39.304
Control. Ace one, going to the bay.

01:32:39.387 --> 01:32:40.555
Ace one, going to the bay.

01:32:53.318 --> 01:32:54.360
Cogman? Ls that normal?

01:32:54.903 --> 01:32:56.154
Perfectly normal, ma'am.

01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:57.739
A nuclear-class
attack submarine is on our stern.

01:32:57.822 --> 01:32:58.823
What?

01:32:58.990 --> 01:33:00.575
Quick, follow me. Quick.

01:33:00.742 --> 01:33:02.035
It's your sub, not mine.

01:33:02.452 --> 01:33:05.789
My sub? Seven hours ago,
i was just a professor.

01:33:09.959 --> 01:33:10.835
All right, uncoupling.

01:33:20.512 --> 01:33:23.181
All right, let's move. Let's move.
Put it in high gear.

01:33:27.227 --> 01:33:28.561
Dsv-2, stay on our tail.

01:33:29.813 --> 01:33:32.482
Conn, sonar.
Alien contact, 1,000 yards and closing.

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:34.109
An alarm on a sub is not a good thing.

01:33:34.192 --> 01:33:35.401
Why did he send us up here?

01:33:35.568 --> 01:33:37.028
He got us up front so we die first.

01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:38.029
Let's let them know we're here.

01:33:38.196 --> 01:33:40.115
Warning shot.
Make tube one ready in all respects.

01:33:40.198 --> 01:33:41.324
Shoot tube one.

01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:52.293
Conn, sonar.
Alien contact going vertical.

01:34:02.887 --> 01:34:04.013
Hold on!

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:13.606
Conn, sonar. It's coming back around.

01:34:13.731 --> 01:34:15.400
- It's gonna hit us!
- Brace for impact!

01:34:16.901 --> 01:34:17.902
Hold on!

01:34:25.076 --> 01:34:26.578
Conn, sonar. He's going deep!

01:34:27.453 --> 01:34:28.913
We're clear for now.

01:34:29.247 --> 01:34:32.250
Hands off! There is a time
and a place for everything.

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:34.878
This is not the time nor the place.

01:34:35.253 --> 01:34:36.588
- Hey!
- Not now!

01:34:36.754 --> 01:34:38.923
- Where are you going?
- Away from here.

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:45.221
That little sicko just shot himself out
like a torpedo!

01:34:45.388 --> 01:34:46.931
I know! I saw it!

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:48.433
Those are your peoples.

01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:59.485
Good afternoon.
Ls the prime minister in?

01:34:59.569 --> 01:35:00.570
Who?

01:35:00.945 --> 01:35:03.114
The prime minister, who else?
It's very urgent.

01:35:03.281 --> 01:35:05.825
It's urgent, is it? Why didn't you say so?

01:35:06.784 --> 01:35:08.161
Thank you. Dickhead.

01:35:08.328 --> 01:35:10.163
I'll use the old entrance.
Good afternoon.

01:35:10.622 --> 01:35:11.956
Get in there.

01:35:22.634 --> 01:35:23.927
Oh, my... sorry.

01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:25.637
L just got this thing that was on my arm

01:35:25.803 --> 01:35:27.013
and it's, like, just moving all around.

01:35:27.305 --> 01:35:31.309
Yeah. It seems to not be... if you'd...

01:35:31.935 --> 01:35:34.103
It's just sort of slithery...

01:35:34.979 --> 01:35:36.314
Slipping from the arm to the...

01:35:36.606 --> 01:35:38.483
- Yeah, it's coming down.
-Lt's going down your pants there.

01:35:38.650 --> 01:35:39.943
Careful.

01:35:40.526 --> 01:35:42.237
And is it tight or gripping on?

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.738
It doesn't hurt,
but I don't know what it does.

01:35:43.821 --> 01:35:45.490
It's like some worthless alien junk.

01:35:45.657 --> 01:35:48.701
I think the purpose... I think the...
We'll find out what the purpose is.

01:35:48.868 --> 01:35:50.495
If... if you want to.

01:35:52.956 --> 01:35:55.500
Cogman! What is... what is all this?

01:35:55.667 --> 01:35:56.834
End of the world.

01:35:56.918 --> 01:35:59.879
I thought a meal, a last meal,
would be in order.

01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:02.423
- Great. I'm starving.
- No canoodling.

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:03.841
Wait, cogman?

01:36:07.178 --> 01:36:08.388
- Yep. My daughter would...
- So my grandma said...

01:36:08.513 --> 01:36:09.597
My daughter would love this.

01:36:10.265 --> 01:36:11.057
My grandma would absolutely...

01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:12.141
She keeps saying I've got to move on.

01:36:12.267 --> 01:36:13.643
Yeah, I was about to say.
She would love it.

01:36:13.726 --> 01:36:15.144
- Really?
- Yes, all the time!

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:17.397
- What does she say?
-"Go on a date, get a boyfriend."

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:18.815
Ls this a date?

01:36:19.482 --> 01:36:22.110
No. God, it's not a date. No.
It's just that...

01:36:22.193 --> 01:36:23.653
It's romantic.

01:36:25.154 --> 01:36:27.240
Sushi <i>√©</i> ia cogman!

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:28.783
Looks great.

01:36:36.165 --> 01:36:37.709
No sacrifice,

01:36:37.875 --> 01:36:38.918
no victory.

01:36:42.839 --> 01:36:44.882
Is the president in his bunker?

01:36:45.508 --> 01:36:46.592
He is.

01:36:46.926 --> 01:36:48.428
How about putin?

01:36:49.721 --> 01:36:51.055
Son of a bitch.

01:36:55.101 --> 01:36:56.519
Are you the new prime minister?

01:36:56.686 --> 01:36:58.604
Security, my office, now!

01:36:58.730 --> 01:37:00.732
I'm sorry. Well, I used the old entrance.

01:37:01.190 --> 01:37:03.234
That door is used
for extraordinary circumstances,

01:37:03.318 --> 01:37:05.361
and these circumstances
are quite extraordinary.

01:37:05.862 --> 01:37:07.655
I will keep this very simple.

01:37:08.114 --> 01:37:09.365
Nasty little fellow.

01:37:09.532 --> 01:37:12.285
I let him out, we all die terrible deaths.

01:37:12.452 --> 01:37:13.703
Do you understand?

01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:16.205
Thank you.

01:37:16.456 --> 01:37:18.249
Now, my name is sir Edmond Burton,

01:37:18.416 --> 01:37:20.835
her majesty's royal Navy,
order of the witwiccans,

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:23.588
keeper of the secret history
of transformers here on earth...

01:37:23.755 --> 01:37:25.631
- Witwiccans?
- Witwiccans, yes.

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:29.719
But they all died out.

01:37:30.094 --> 01:37:33.348
Not all of them. Not yet, anyway.

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:35.641
But I do need you to marshal
all your resources...

01:37:35.808 --> 01:37:37.435
- Hold on. You have just...
- Best shut up.

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:39.437
- Emerged from the wall and now...
- Let me finish. Let me...

01:37:39.562 --> 01:37:40.855
Shut up!

01:37:44.192 --> 01:37:46.361
Shut up.

01:37:48.029 --> 01:37:50.156
Okay. As I said, I need you to marshal

01:37:50.239 --> 01:37:52.408
all your resources,
all your military assets.

01:37:52.742 --> 01:37:55.119
Because as you no doubt
have surmised,

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:56.662
the world is going to end,

01:37:57.038 --> 01:37:59.332
and I know where. And when.

01:38:06.339 --> 01:38:10.093
You are the first to see this ship
since the dark ages.

01:38:10.426 --> 01:38:14.931
Your talisman is the key
to unlocking this ship.

01:38:28.778 --> 01:38:30.530
Sonar has about 800 meters.

01:38:33.116 --> 01:38:35.493
I think I got a bogey at four o'clock.

01:38:35.827 --> 01:38:37.912
<i>We're starting to see it
through the murk.</i>

01:38:39.747 --> 01:38:41.416
<i>There's lights down here.</i>

01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:45.670
Oh, my god. Look at that.
It's a big alien ship.

01:38:46.295 --> 01:38:49.173
<i>Topside, are you catching this?
It's massive.</i>

01:38:55.221 --> 01:38:56.305
The ship knows we're here.

01:39:12.864 --> 01:39:13.865
Stay on his tail.

01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:19.871
Shit.

01:39:25.042 --> 01:39:26.919
<i>The door just sealed.</i>

01:39:28.463 --> 01:39:29.547
Try those tubes.

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:32.383
Dsv-2, stay close. Stay close.

01:39:32.925 --> 01:39:34.218
<i>Topside, we're going in.</i>

01:39:35.052 --> 01:39:36.721
We're gonna lose radio contact.

01:39:48.065 --> 01:39:49.150
We're in a current!

01:39:49.233 --> 01:39:50.234
Steady, steady, steady!

01:39:50.902 --> 01:39:52.653
Use the arms to keep us...

01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:56.741
- Keep control!
- Stay off the wall!

01:39:56.866 --> 01:39:57.909
- Hold it!
- Stay off the wall!

01:40:20.097 --> 01:40:21.098
What now?

01:40:21.557 --> 01:40:22.767
You're the last knight.

01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:26.771
You're the Earl's special guy.
You figure it out.

01:40:28.147 --> 01:40:29.273
Let's go.

01:40:30.066 --> 01:40:31.609
I'm not going in that water.

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:34.779
My gears would be sucked
into my main shaft.

01:40:38.241 --> 01:40:40.451
Now you're both on my shit list.

01:41:06.936 --> 01:41:08.479
We were blinded.

01:41:08.854 --> 01:41:10.356
Blinded by the sun.

01:41:11.148 --> 01:41:13.401
The planet hid its approach
behind our star.

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:17.196
It seems to be acting deliberately.

01:41:41.262 --> 01:41:43.306
Dozens of strikes currently modeled.

01:41:44.223 --> 01:41:46.976
First impact will be Alpha station.

01:41:47.059 --> 01:41:48.060
There is no escape pod.

01:41:49.228 --> 01:41:51.147
<i>Earth will follow two hours later.</i>

01:41:51.439 --> 01:41:54.525
Dominic modeled potential casualties
in the tens of millions.

01:41:57.111 --> 01:41:58.195
There's two moons!

01:41:58.362 --> 01:42:00.031
There's two moons!

01:42:00.531 --> 01:42:02.241
The world is ending?

01:42:03.284 --> 01:42:05.036
<i>Some are saying that it's
going to be a global killer.</i>

01:42:05.202 --> 01:42:08.247
<i>Human civilization as we know it
will change in 12 hours.</i>

01:42:08.539 --> 01:42:11.000
<i>The destruction, we're told
by experts, will be immense.</i>

01:42:28.059 --> 01:42:29.143
This is unbelievable.

01:42:29.226 --> 01:42:30.269
Yeah, it is unbelievable.

01:42:30.645 --> 01:42:31.854
What does the old man want us to do?

01:42:40.029 --> 01:42:41.572
Bee, go around, find another way!
Come on!

01:42:41.697 --> 01:42:42.782
<i>What? Are you serious?</i>

01:42:42.948 --> 01:42:44.992
<i>Think I like winding up
in a place like this?</i>

01:42:51.374 --> 01:42:53.292
It wants us to go this way.

01:42:56.212 --> 01:42:58.839
Daytrader! Son of a bitch
actually came through with our ship!

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:01.550
Excellent. We are going to england.

01:43:01.634 --> 01:43:03.886
Things are likely to get nasty.
Real nasty.

01:43:03.969 --> 01:43:06.305
Hey, can I come? He might need me.

01:43:06.764 --> 01:43:10.184
Little lady, hell,
i ain't no earth parent. Hop aboard.

01:43:10.267 --> 01:43:12.144
Take a field trip to the front lines.

01:43:12.311 --> 01:43:13.437
Let's go make some noise.

01:43:13.521 --> 01:43:15.147
Let's give 'em hell.

01:43:15.481 --> 01:43:16.982
I'm driving.

01:43:17.858 --> 01:43:20.444
Hey, Cade, I'm reluctant
to say this to you, but

01:43:20.861 --> 01:43:23.698
I think that you're quite,
you know, brave.

01:43:23.989 --> 01:43:25.324
Is that a compliment?

01:43:26.242 --> 01:43:28.077
You could throw one back my way.

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:29.995
Well, that's got to happen organically.

01:43:30.955 --> 01:43:32.540
I was the first off the sub.

01:43:39.296 --> 01:43:40.923
Hold it! Hold.

01:43:41.757 --> 01:43:42.967
I think it's here!

01:44:17.251 --> 01:44:18.252
It's a tomb.

01:44:20.337 --> 01:44:21.422
<i>Station, Houston.</i>

01:44:21.505 --> 01:44:24.717
<i>Page five of the safe zone
config procedure.</i>

01:44:25.176 --> 01:44:27.178
<i>Take thrusters to auto.</i>

01:44:29.054 --> 01:44:30.556
Lt's happening-

01:44:31.223 --> 01:44:32.850
it's in our atmosphere now.

01:44:33.017 --> 01:44:34.435
<i>Iss is our first hit.</i>

01:44:34.894 --> 01:44:36.687
<i>Progress manifolds both failed.</i>

01:44:36.896 --> 01:44:38.481
<i>No thrusters available.</i>

01:44:39.273 --> 01:44:41.192
<i>Conjunction is imminent.</i>

01:44:41.776 --> 01:44:44.445
<i>Good luck and godspeed.</i>

01:44:53.496 --> 01:44:54.872
Move in, move in, check up.

01:45:03.547 --> 01:45:04.965
Formality.

01:45:06.175 --> 01:45:08.177
Knights are always guarding something.

01:45:11.096 --> 01:45:12.264
Hang on. Look at this.

01:45:13.057 --> 01:45:14.058
It's Celtic.

01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:36.622
It's Merlin.

01:45:37.373 --> 01:45:38.457
It's real.

01:45:39.041 --> 01:45:40.167
All of it!

01:45:40.501 --> 01:45:42.002
Wait, what does this say?

01:45:44.839 --> 01:45:46.340
It means, "no one shall have it."

01:45:46.966 --> 01:45:49.927
Wait a minute. We came all the way
down here, all this,

01:45:50.719 --> 01:45:52.263
and you're not gonna open it?

01:45:53.264 --> 01:45:54.431
Of course I'm going to open it.

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:56.642
Good. Let's go.

01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:59.103
Ready? Let's do this.

01:46:12.283 --> 01:46:13.325
You got to be kidding me.

01:46:17.162 --> 01:46:19.123
We've come all this way for this?

01:46:19.665 --> 01:46:21.125
For your ugly
great-great granddad's bones

01:46:21.292 --> 01:46:23.419
in a box and some stupid stick?

01:46:23.752 --> 01:46:24.712
You got to be kidding me.

01:46:24.795 --> 01:46:26.046
How are we gonna
save the world with this?

01:46:26.463 --> 01:46:29.133
I could've cut an oak tree
down at my house and...

01:46:29.633 --> 01:46:31.051
Don't say a word. Okay?

01:46:31.135 --> 01:46:33.804
The smooth little romantic accent's
not gonna work right now.

01:46:34.638 --> 01:46:36.640
- L'm speechless.
- Thank god.

01:46:36.807 --> 01:46:38.183
Maybe someone stole it?

01:46:38.726 --> 01:46:40.352
No, there's something else.
It's got to be here somewhere.

01:46:41.896 --> 01:46:43.898
I didn't come all this way for nothing.

01:46:44.231 --> 01:46:46.233
The whole world's at stake.

01:46:54.241 --> 01:46:56.535
Guys, the meters are freaking.

01:46:57.286 --> 01:47:00.039
I got thermals everywhere.
These things, they...

01:47:01.290 --> 01:47:02.958
They could still be alive.

01:47:05.127 --> 01:47:07.129
The hell happened to you?

01:47:15.054 --> 01:47:17.806
Who has come for the staff?

01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:21.185
Shoot him! Shoot him!

01:47:25.439 --> 01:47:27.483
- Move!
- Get out!

01:47:31.111 --> 01:47:32.863
I'm going to distract him.
Get out of here.

01:47:35.449 --> 01:47:37.660
- I have the staff!
- Hit it!

01:47:46.043 --> 01:47:48.045
Protect the staff.

01:47:53.717 --> 01:47:55.052
Take his eyes out!

01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:28.043
This thing's moving.

01:48:29.461 --> 01:48:30.587
Corner her!

01:48:30.796 --> 01:48:31.964
Hey.

01:48:32.297 --> 01:48:33.674
Drop the weapon.

01:48:36.010 --> 01:48:36.927
Do it!

01:48:40.389 --> 01:48:42.057
You drop it, or I will.

01:48:45.185 --> 01:48:46.478
You don't know
what you're doing, Lennox. Stop!

01:48:46.603 --> 01:48:47.688
All I want is that weapon!

01:48:47.771 --> 01:48:49.106
- Go ahead, shoot me!
- No!

01:48:49.648 --> 01:48:51.316
Only I can wield it.

01:48:51.608 --> 01:48:52.609
Go on!

01:48:53.736 --> 01:48:54.987
Do it!

01:48:55.612 --> 01:48:57.114
Shoot me!

01:48:57.281 --> 01:48:58.824
You don't know
what you're doing, Lennox.

01:49:00.451 --> 01:49:01.618
Don't.

01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:05.205
Protect the staff.

01:49:22.765 --> 01:49:25.601
I've come for that staff.

01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:34.526
Optimus... what are you doing?

01:49:35.069 --> 01:49:36.320
Give it to me.

01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:39.031
It's me, Cade. We fought together.

01:49:39.114 --> 01:49:43.410
I fight for my own kind! My own planet!

01:49:44.078 --> 01:49:45.746
- Cade?
- This isn't you, prime.

01:49:45.913 --> 01:49:48.373
Give me the staff, human.

01:49:48.999 --> 01:49:50.000
Cade?

01:49:50.834 --> 01:49:52.669
I will kill you.

01:49:52.795 --> 01:49:53.796
Give it to him.

01:49:59.927 --> 01:50:00.928
Now.

01:50:15.025 --> 01:50:17.528
Who dares to challenge me?

01:50:26.203 --> 01:50:27.412
It's all wrong, bee.

01:50:27.579 --> 01:50:29.039
Something happened.
That is not optimus.

01:50:29.206 --> 01:50:31.375
You got to find him, bee.
Remember zb-7?

01:50:31.542 --> 01:50:33.418
You got to be that autobot again.

01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:35.546
Look you got to get back to the sub,
all right? Get out of here.

01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:36.755
Wait, what about you?

01:50:36.839 --> 01:50:39.174
Bee's always had my back.
It's my turn to have his. Go.

01:50:39.341 --> 01:50:40.509
All right, get back to the dsv.

01:50:40.759 --> 01:50:43.053
Let them know up top that
we lost control of the weapon.

01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:44.555
Roger that, sir.

01:50:44.721 --> 01:50:46.598
You heard him. Back to the sub!

01:50:46.723 --> 01:50:48.225
We're gonna find him.

01:51:42.362 --> 01:51:43.906
Come on, we got to get to the top!

01:51:46.867 --> 01:51:49.203
Holy shit. Holy shit.

01:51:50.454 --> 01:51:52.080
We can make it! Come on!

01:52:06.637 --> 01:52:08.639
Watch out, big wave coming!

01:52:27.532 --> 01:52:29.910
I am Nemesis prime.

01:52:31.203 --> 01:52:33.372
You are nothing!

01:52:39.419 --> 01:52:40.671
Move it!

01:52:41.546 --> 01:52:43.507
<i>Air's gonna be on station 14 to 16.</i>

01:52:43.674 --> 01:52:46.510
<i>Toc, it looks like
we have a surfaced alien ship.</i>

01:52:47.552 --> 01:52:49.972
<i>Lightning 4 has visual on optimus.</i>

01:52:54.559 --> 01:52:56.228
Prime! Prime, stop!

01:52:56.561 --> 01:52:59.523
Prime, you got to stop!
Please! Don't do this!

01:53:00.107 --> 01:53:01.191
Look at me, prime.

01:53:01.525 --> 01:53:03.777
What are you doing? It's bee!

01:53:04.027 --> 01:53:06.113
Prime! You can't do this.

01:53:50.824 --> 01:53:51.908
Prime!

01:53:53.744 --> 01:53:55.245
Stop! No!

01:53:56.913 --> 01:54:00.584
I am Bumblebee, your oldest friend.

01:54:01.168 --> 01:54:02.502
Optimus,

01:54:03.253 --> 01:54:06.340
I would lay down my life for you.

01:54:14.556 --> 01:54:17.726
Bumblebee. Your voice.

01:54:18.268 --> 01:54:19.770
I have not heard it

01:54:20.312 --> 01:54:22.606
since cybertron fell.

01:54:36.495 --> 01:54:39.498
What have I done?

01:54:50.509 --> 01:54:53.345
You blew your chance to kill unicron.

01:54:54.137 --> 01:54:56.640
I knew you couldn't do it.

01:54:57.140 --> 01:54:59.935
Your time is over, prime.

01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:01.478
You failed.

01:55:02.479 --> 01:55:05.690
You turned your back on cybertron.

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:08.944
Now you will watch earth die.

01:55:11.279 --> 01:55:12.280
No!

01:55:18.995 --> 01:55:20.705
Not going so well.

01:55:32.342 --> 01:55:33.343
Cade!

01:55:38.849 --> 01:55:41.601
You betrayed your own kind.

01:55:41.852 --> 01:55:43.186
No, prime, get up!

01:55:43.353 --> 01:55:45.856
You chose the wrong side.

01:55:46.022 --> 01:55:50.652
The guardian knights
are going to kill me.

01:55:50.861 --> 01:55:53.321
Quintessa is the great deceiver!

01:56:00.745 --> 01:56:03.957
The judgment is death.

01:56:58.178 --> 01:57:01.348
Cade, I have failed you.

01:57:04.017 --> 01:57:06.061
I have doomed earth.

01:57:07.771 --> 01:57:11.358
Earth, the only place in the universe

01:57:12.108 --> 01:57:15.111
whose people let me call it

01:57:16.279 --> 01:57:17.781
home.

01:57:22.077 --> 01:57:24.079
Only you can make it right, prime.

01:57:25.705 --> 01:57:27.374
I can't do it without you.

01:57:28.542 --> 01:57:30.544
One moment, that's all we got.

01:57:31.670 --> 01:57:33.338
It's up to you, prime.

01:57:33.755 --> 01:57:34.881
Because without you,

01:57:35.757 --> 01:57:37.092
we all die.

01:57:40.178 --> 01:57:41.680
It's now or never.

01:57:42.681 --> 01:57:44.182
My brothers,

01:57:44.683 --> 01:57:48.520
I will never betray you again.

01:57:49.521 --> 01:57:52.274
Lam optimus prime.

01:57:52.357 --> 01:57:56.194
To save earth, we must go to cybertron

01:57:56.486 --> 01:57:59.155
and destroy quintessa.

01:58:22.387 --> 01:58:24.222
The ship is coming.

01:58:24.639 --> 01:58:26.182
It is beautiful.

01:58:38.486 --> 01:58:40.614
Optimus prime gave us
the coordinates for the endgame.

01:58:40.697 --> 01:58:41.906
It's an ignition chamber.

01:58:42.198 --> 01:58:43.575
<i>The weapon's going up there.</i>

01:58:44.034 --> 01:58:45.243
Get preds and satellites eyes on.

01:58:45.493 --> 01:58:47.912
Find it and prepare to engage.

01:58:49.539 --> 01:58:50.749
Cyclops, 21,000 feet.

01:58:50.915 --> 01:58:52.876
Eyeball target, ignition chamber.
We found it.

01:58:53.043 --> 01:58:54.377
<i>Prime's coordinates are good.</i>

01:58:54.544 --> 01:58:56.671
Contact, ignition chamber.
Target in sight.

01:58:58.089 --> 01:58:59.633
Ignition chamber, ignition chamber.

01:58:59.716 --> 01:59:01.760
We've got to figure out
what makes it tick.

01:59:02.135 --> 01:59:03.803
We've got to shut it down!

01:59:04.971 --> 01:59:06.431
Come on, come on, come on!

01:59:07.307 --> 01:59:08.642
Good to see you.

01:59:08.725 --> 01:59:10.393
Let's get out of here! Let's go!

01:59:13.438 --> 01:59:14.939
General, we're gonna prep
a halo jump

01:59:15.023 --> 01:59:16.066
on that ignition chamber.

01:59:16.608 --> 01:59:18.234
Planes will never nav
through those vines.

01:59:18.485 --> 01:59:21.112
Lennox, trust me.
That's our ride right there.

01:59:21.905 --> 01:59:24.199
<i>Our autobot ship.
Put the ospreys in that.</i>

01:59:24.282 --> 01:59:25.575
<i>It'll get us up there.</i>

01:59:25.742 --> 01:59:27.494
<i>Autobot ship's gonna drop the ospreys.</i>

01:59:27.577 --> 01:59:29.871
<i>They'll virtually glide to the lz.
It's gonna be high-risk.</i>

01:59:29.954 --> 01:59:32.457
They want to do what at 20,000 feet?

01:59:32.666 --> 01:59:34.834
Sir, there's this girl.
Woman, actually. Teacher.

01:59:34.918 --> 01:59:36.920
- Oxford.
- She plays a little Polo.

01:59:38.004 --> 01:59:40.090
Well, that's fantastic.

01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:41.883
<i>They're gonna break her
into the chamber</i>

01:59:41.966 --> 01:59:43.093
<i>to steal the staff.</i>

01:59:43.259 --> 01:59:46.888
Okay, that is the dumbest idea
you could possibly have!

01:59:47.097 --> 01:59:49.349
<i>Personally, I'm gonna rely on
physics and mathematics</i>

01:59:49.432 --> 01:59:50.433
<i>to save the planet,</i>

01:59:50.517 --> 01:59:53.019
<i>not mysticism, fairies,
and some hobgoblins.</i>

02:00:10.620 --> 02:00:12.205
I've lived for this.

02:00:12.288 --> 02:00:14.666
I've lived to kill a planet!

02:00:15.667 --> 02:00:18.795
For our world, I activate this portal!

02:00:35.562 --> 02:00:36.688
Fire!

02:00:59.169 --> 02:01:01.588
You wretched human!

02:01:20.648 --> 02:01:21.649
Hey!

02:01:26.362 --> 02:01:27.697
Hey.

02:01:29.365 --> 02:01:31.284
You got my message.
You brought everyone here.

02:01:31.367 --> 02:01:32.494
Come on.

02:01:34.913 --> 02:01:35.914
Hey!

02:01:36.414 --> 02:01:38.583
I just found optimus prime!

02:01:39.709 --> 02:01:41.711
He's gonna deal with all this shit!

02:01:42.212 --> 02:01:44.214
He's gonna save our asses!

02:01:45.381 --> 02:01:47.842
I brought the troops, man.
I brought the troops.

02:01:48.718 --> 02:01:50.595
Knights, autobots,

02:01:50.929 --> 02:01:54.599
this cannot and will not be the end.

02:01:56.226 --> 02:01:58.937
To save earth and her people,

02:01:59.229 --> 02:02:02.398
we are going to steal quintessa's staff.

02:02:03.024 --> 02:02:06.027
Only you, viviane, can take it back.

02:02:07.904 --> 02:02:10.406
I will lead the way into her chamber.

02:02:12.242 --> 02:02:16.287
And when the account of the ages
is etched into the cosmos,

02:02:16.621 --> 02:02:20.375
let those who exist long after us know

02:02:20.959 --> 02:02:24.504
that this was our finest hour.

02:02:30.385 --> 02:02:33.263
Love that guy. Goosebumps every time.

02:02:33.596 --> 02:02:34.889
I never got to say hi.

02:02:37.767 --> 02:02:39.269
Here they come.

02:02:39.561 --> 02:02:41.104
You think there's enough?

02:02:41.187 --> 02:02:42.605
No, not even close.

02:02:45.108 --> 02:02:46.901
My lord! Lord folgan!

02:02:56.995 --> 02:02:58.663
I had it, cogman.

02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:02.292
I had my moment.

02:03:04.252 --> 02:03:05.920
You did, my lord.

02:03:07.547 --> 02:03:09.382
This is the hardest part of my job.

02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:12.510
Watching folgans die.

02:03:13.678 --> 02:03:15.638
Thank you, cogman.

02:03:16.180 --> 02:03:17.515
Carry on.

02:03:22.145 --> 02:03:25.648
Of all the earls I have had
the pleasure to serve,

02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:28.401
you were by far the coolest.

02:03:41.497 --> 02:03:43.875
I have found your staff of power.

02:03:45.168 --> 02:03:47.378
There is only one who can hurt us.

02:03:47.837 --> 02:03:51.049
I felt her. She must not enter.

02:03:51.424 --> 02:03:53.468
My army will stop them.

02:03:54.552 --> 02:03:58.848
Watch as our world heals
and theirs dies.

02:03:59.849 --> 02:04:01.851
A world reborn!

02:04:27.710 --> 02:04:29.045
It's coming.

02:04:43.977 --> 02:04:45.520
It's gonna crush us.

02:04:45.687 --> 02:04:47.355
Get that ship clear
of the crush zone now!

02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:49.524
- We got to bail!
- Move to the ospreys!

02:04:59.242 --> 02:05:01.577
Move, move, move! To the ospreys!

02:05:01.869 --> 02:05:02.954
That thing's gonna roll right over us!

02:05:12.422 --> 02:05:13.423
Move!

02:05:25.309 --> 02:05:28.229
<i>Preliminary numbers
are starting to come in.</i>

02:05:28.312 --> 02:05:32.358
<i>Literally scraping away cities.
Millions will die.</i>

02:05:46.122 --> 02:05:47.957
It's using earth's geothermal energy

02:05:48.124 --> 02:05:49.876
<i>to reconstitute,
to rebuild itself, all right?</i>

02:05:49.959 --> 02:05:53.171
<i>If our core cools,
which is rapidly cooling right now,</i>

02:05:53.296 --> 02:05:55.298
<i>the magnetic field dissolves,
exposing us</i>

02:05:55.631 --> 02:05:57.383
to high levels of cosmic radiation.

02:05:58.259 --> 02:05:59.761
Maybe you'll understand this.

02:06:00.219 --> 02:06:01.637
<i>The earth becomes a microwave.</i>

02:06:01.929 --> 02:06:04.432
We're the popcorn. Jiffy pop bag goes

02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:05.892
boom.

02:06:06.517 --> 02:06:08.519
<i>Wei‚Äú!-</i>

02:06:21.741 --> 02:06:23.326
very mean-looking.

02:06:23.659 --> 02:06:26.204
They look like wusses to me.

02:06:26.788 --> 02:06:28.498
<i>No, they all messed up.</i>

02:06:29.332 --> 02:06:31.250
Two minutes! Hey, two minutes!

02:06:32.001 --> 02:06:33.795
- That thing kill Decepticons?
- No.

02:06:34.879 --> 02:06:36.214
We do.

02:06:38.424 --> 02:06:41.761
"A few brave warriors
willing to sacrifice all."

02:06:42.512 --> 02:06:45.014
I told my students that was bullshit.

02:06:45.348 --> 02:06:46.849
Load out, let's go!

02:06:48.643 --> 02:06:51.229
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Are you asking me that now?

02:06:51.312 --> 02:06:52.438
Yeah, I am.

02:06:52.647 --> 02:06:54.982
No plans? Good.

02:06:55.858 --> 02:06:57.026
Get in the plane.

02:06:57.819 --> 02:06:59.654
- Let's go, let's go!
- Let's step it up!

02:06:59.862 --> 02:07:01.531
Strap in. It's gonna be a rough ride.

02:07:02.323 --> 02:07:03.574
- Tighter.
-L'm gonna hook you up.

02:07:03.699 --> 02:07:05.201
Pull it down tight, right? Just this one?

02:07:05.451 --> 02:07:06.452
You jump¬ª

02:07:06.536 --> 02:07:08.204
- then pull this, right?
- This is the one I pull, right?

02:07:08.371 --> 02:07:10.248
Pull? Just pull it?
You just pull it as hard as you can?

02:07:10.915 --> 02:07:11.999
Are you all right?

02:07:12.583 --> 02:07:15.294
Can I borrow your cell phone?
I've got to text my daughter.

02:07:15.503 --> 02:07:16.504
Thanks.

02:07:24.428 --> 02:07:25.429
All right.

02:07:25.888 --> 02:07:27.223
Thank you.

02:07:38.276 --> 02:07:39.610
<i>Target in sight.</i>

02:07:41.279 --> 02:07:42.572
<i>Contact, ignition chamber.</i>

02:07:42.738 --> 02:07:44.282
<i>Strike package. Execute. Execute.</i>

02:07:44.407 --> 02:07:46.075
<i>Fight's on, fight's on, fight's on.</i>

02:07:56.419 --> 02:07:58.254
<i>Bogeys inbound. Bogeys inbound.</i>

02:07:58.588 --> 02:08:01.090
Bee, get to your ship. Good luck.

02:08:01.757 --> 02:08:03.092
Thirty seconds to drop!

02:08:03.885 --> 02:08:05.761
Those birds better be
softening our target.

02:08:05.845 --> 02:08:07.722
You're not giving me that
warm, fuzzy feeling, Lennox.

02:08:08.181 --> 02:08:09.515
The osprey's flight ceiling
is 12,000 feet.

02:08:09.599 --> 02:08:10.892
We're double that.

02:08:11.017 --> 02:08:12.977
The air's too thin,
the rotor's got no grab.

02:08:13.102 --> 02:08:14.520
We're gonna be coming in hard.

02:08:14.979 --> 02:08:17.064
- It's all bad news.
- Yeah.

02:08:19.734 --> 02:08:20.818
All good, yeager?

02:08:21.277 --> 02:08:22.695
You got something to say?

02:08:23.196 --> 02:08:24.947
You and your guys
never stopped hunting me.

02:08:25.239 --> 02:08:27.241
Orders. You were with them.

02:08:27.450 --> 02:08:28.492
With "them"?

02:08:28.993 --> 02:08:30.703
I believed in one of the great ones.

02:08:30.786 --> 02:08:33.164
Optimus prime. And his crew.
I never lost faith.

02:08:33.956 --> 02:08:35.958
You did. The whole world did.

02:08:36.292 --> 02:08:37.752
Now you want to fly with me.

02:08:40.046 --> 02:08:43.007
Well, I appreciate you guys
making the trip. Thank you.

02:08:49.138 --> 02:08:50.306
Get that staff,

02:08:51.515 --> 02:08:53.017
we all go home.

02:08:59.649 --> 02:09:01.776
<i>Lennox, your team is to hold.</i>

02:09:01.859 --> 02:09:03.444
<i>Strike fighters are getting shot down.</i>

02:09:03.819 --> 02:09:07.198
No, it's now or never.
Pilots, go now! Go!

02:09:07.365 --> 02:09:08.616
Hang on!

02:09:09.242 --> 02:09:10.076
<i>Chihuahua.</i>

02:09:10.284 --> 02:09:12.703
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know.

02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:14.747
But you said we were family.

02:09:15.331 --> 02:09:17.500
No, I didn't mean...
We got to get her off here now.

02:09:18.376 --> 02:09:19.669
It was probably a bad idea.

02:09:26.008 --> 02:09:27.510
<i>Six birds out of the nest.</i>

02:09:34.392 --> 02:09:35.393
<i>All ospreys clear.</i>

02:09:35.476 --> 02:09:37.019
<i>Push the target, push the target.</i>

02:09:40.606 --> 02:09:41.649
Hang on!

02:09:42.191 --> 02:09:44.277
- Chihuahua.
-Lt's okay. It's okay.

02:09:54.370 --> 02:09:56.372
<i>All fast movers, distract, distract.</i>

02:09:56.539 --> 02:09:58.207
<i>Keep those enemies
away from the ospreys!</i>

02:09:58.541 --> 02:10:00.167
Bogeys dead ahead!

02:10:05.214 --> 02:10:07.717
<i>Control, spread it out, spread it out.</i>

02:10:14.265 --> 02:10:16.142
Those fighters better
distract those enemy ships!

02:10:19.061 --> 02:10:21.230
<i>I got bogeys coming in hot, one o'clock.</i>

02:10:26.110 --> 02:10:27.194
<i>I got three bogeys.</i>

02:10:30.698 --> 02:10:31.991
Watch the rotor!

02:10:35.244 --> 02:10:36.746
Sir, bird three just went down!

02:10:57.099 --> 02:10:58.934
There's our landing zone.

02:11:01.437 --> 02:11:02.813
Take that big gun out.

02:11:04.607 --> 02:11:06.609
Viper flight, focus on that gun.

02:11:13.657 --> 02:11:15.284
Hold on, we're going down!

02:11:15.409 --> 02:11:16.452
<i>It's gonna be a hard hit.</i>

02:11:16.577 --> 02:11:17.620
<i>Don't slide off the edge!</i>

02:11:17.787 --> 02:11:19.121
<i>Brace, brace, brace!</i>

02:11:20.581 --> 02:11:22.249
<i>Two's down, two's down.</i>

02:11:32.218 --> 02:11:33.302
Brace for impact!

02:11:42.019 --> 02:11:44.522
- Out of the bird!
- Grab a buddy!

02:11:47.316 --> 02:11:48.150
Get out of the bird! Go!

02:11:49.276 --> 02:11:50.820
Back up. Hurry up, back up.

02:11:55.074 --> 02:11:55.866
Enemy fighters!

02:12:32.695 --> 02:12:34.947
That gun emplacement
is tearing us apart!

02:12:39.368 --> 02:12:42.163
There's the ignition chamber,
dead ahead!

02:12:46.792 --> 02:12:48.544
<i>Air cover not coming. Unable.</i>

02:12:52.923 --> 02:12:54.258
Let's ride, bee!

02:12:54.383 --> 02:12:55.551
Let's kick ass!

02:13:02.725 --> 02:13:04.727
Push right to the crater! Let's go!

02:13:15.654 --> 02:13:17.698
Pinned down with the hound!

02:13:19.909 --> 02:13:23.746
- No way. Where's optimus?
- They said he never made it.

02:13:24.246 --> 02:13:25.623
We got the big gun on us!

02:13:25.873 --> 02:13:27.416
We're pinned down!

02:13:28.959 --> 02:13:31.045
Negative to target. Unable to advance.

02:13:33.714 --> 02:13:35.549
- Get back here, Izzy!
-Lzzy!

02:13:35.633 --> 02:13:36.717
I'll be right back!

02:13:36.884 --> 02:13:39.386
It's just a cluster effin' thingamabob!

02:13:45.309 --> 02:13:47.102
Sqweeks! Hey, hey...

02:13:47.603 --> 02:13:49.480
Look, I need you to blow that gun up!

02:13:51.857 --> 02:13:52.983
<i>Mommy.</i>

02:13:53.108 --> 02:13:54.902
You're small and you're ugly.
No one's gonna see you coming.

02:13:57.530 --> 02:13:58.572
Blow it up!

02:14:04.912 --> 02:14:06.580
Infernocus,

02:14:06.789 --> 02:14:09.208
transform. Kill them!

02:14:14.755 --> 02:14:16.674
I don't have enough ammo for that thing.

02:14:16.966 --> 02:14:18.300
<i>L</i> got him!

02:14:35.693 --> 02:14:37.903
Bee and hot rod are down!
Autobots down!

02:14:37.987 --> 02:14:39.154
Where's prime?

02:14:39.238 --> 02:14:40.447
<i>Ay, chihuahua.</i>

02:14:40.573 --> 02:14:42.324
<i>It's a no-go, general.
We're pinned down!</i>

02:14:42.449 --> 02:14:44.827
<i>Yeah, well, that hobgoblin
stuff didn't work, did it?</i>

02:14:44.952 --> 02:14:47.162
<i>I got a hail Mary. How about physics?</i>

02:14:47.538 --> 02:14:48.706
Okay, I just did the simulation.

02:14:48.831 --> 02:14:50.583
It's like if Tiger Woods
was making a big divot

02:14:50.666 --> 02:14:51.709
with his nine-iron.

02:14:51.792 --> 02:14:53.002
Stu, out! Come on, man.

02:14:53.669 --> 02:14:55.879
<i>All right, there's a chunk right here
that's held up by thin vines.</i>

02:14:55.963 --> 02:14:57.798
<i>You gotta blow up those vines,
use tactical nukes to blow out</i>

02:14:57.881 --> 02:14:59.174
the vines and let it swing.

02:14:59.341 --> 02:15:00.301
<i>Okay, you let gravity do the rest.</i>

02:15:00.384 --> 02:15:01.635
<i>The chamber comes down,</i>

02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:03.053
the energy transfer stops,
and the earth is saved.

02:15:03.220 --> 02:15:04.221
You're welcome.

02:15:04.930 --> 02:15:06.849
I need tac-nuke authority.

02:15:06.932 --> 02:15:09.268
<i>Lennox team, we are pulling you out.
Mission's over.</i>

02:15:09.351 --> 02:15:11.145
<i>Laze targets for incoming strike fighters.</i>

02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:12.521
<i>Then I'm ordering you to bail.</i>

02:15:12.605 --> 02:15:13.814
Roger that. Picture's up.

02:15:14.231 --> 02:15:15.983
I see it, I see it.

02:15:16.483 --> 02:15:19.320
We got a new target!
Three o'clock high!

02:15:19.737 --> 02:15:22.197
Laze the new target for incoming birds.

02:15:22.364 --> 02:15:23.866
They're gonna bring
that whole thing down on us.

02:15:24.199 --> 02:15:25.159
Hey! We're not giving up
on prime, okay?

02:15:25.242 --> 02:15:26.243
He's gonna be here!

02:15:26.535 --> 02:15:28.829
They just changed the whole plan.
We can't get inside.

02:15:28.954 --> 02:15:30.789
- What?
- The operation is over.

02:15:30.873 --> 02:15:31.874
We stay, we're dead.

02:15:32.207 --> 02:15:33.208
I have to get in there!

02:15:33.375 --> 02:15:35.127
Everybody, grab your chutes,
we're bailing!

02:15:39.214 --> 02:15:40.549
<i>...you.</i>

02:15:48.223 --> 02:15:49.266
<i>Fight, fight, fight.</i>

02:15:49.350 --> 02:15:50.392
<i>Fight's on.</i>

02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:58.192
Good job, little friend.

02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:00.819
- Laze the target!
- Move, move, move!

02:16:02.196 --> 02:16:03.155
Let's move!

02:16:03.238 --> 02:16:05.908
Let's move out!
We got you covered! Move!

02:16:10.954 --> 02:16:12.373
Optimus.

02:16:15.084 --> 02:16:16.085
Yeah!

02:16:35.103 --> 02:16:37.397
You ugly mess!

02:16:40.776 --> 02:16:43.861
Did you forget who I am?

02:16:54.581 --> 02:16:57.418
Lam optimus prime.

02:16:57.793 --> 02:17:00.462
Autobots, attack!

02:17:08.971 --> 02:17:09.972
Laze the target!

02:17:10.848 --> 02:17:12.766
Laze it, laze it, laze it.

02:17:13.350 --> 02:17:15.018
<i>Laser paint confirmed.
Laser paint confirmed on target.</i>

02:17:15.144 --> 02:17:16.145
Come on!

02:17:16.227 --> 02:17:17.146
<i>Silver arrows, fire.</i>

02:17:18.272 --> 02:17:19.815
<i>Missiles away, missiles away.</i>

02:17:20.022 --> 02:17:21.358
Go, go!

02:17:22.359 --> 02:17:23.818
Go!

02:17:25.236 --> 02:17:27.740
- Come on, let's go
- I don't think I can do this.

02:17:28.949 --> 02:17:29.867
Nine seconds.

02:17:29.992 --> 02:17:30.993
We're going home, Izzy.

02:17:33.454 --> 02:17:35.289
<i>Mademoiselle, don't go!</i>

02:17:35.873 --> 02:17:37.249
Where is viviane?

02:17:37.332 --> 02:17:39.752
She's gone, boss.
They're all chickening out.

02:17:39.959 --> 02:17:42.087
What if you're wrong, Lennox?
What if it doesn't work?

02:17:42.212 --> 02:17:43.172
It's gonna work!

02:17:43.672 --> 02:17:45.382
Look, we're doing this together, okay?

02:17:45.591 --> 02:17:48.050
- Here we go.
- Hit it, hit it, hit it...

02:17:56.184 --> 02:17:59.271
We got to go! We're bailing.

02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:01.607
- What are you doing?
-Lt's just dusty old books.

02:18:01.773 --> 02:18:02.816
What?

02:18:05.277 --> 02:18:06.528
Wait!

02:18:06.695 --> 02:18:08.572
She's got to be kidding me. Shit!

02:18:24.838 --> 02:18:27.049
Viviane! Get in here!

02:18:27.382 --> 02:18:28.884
Yes! My little lady.

02:18:43.315 --> 02:18:44.733
Wait!

02:18:49.154 --> 02:18:50.656
Cade!

02:18:57.995 --> 02:19:00.874
Command, be advised,
ignition chamber is tumbling.

02:19:01.124 --> 02:19:03.293
I repeat, chamber is broke loose.
It is falling.

02:19:13.136 --> 02:19:15.472
<i>The energy transfer is still continuing.</i>

02:19:15.556 --> 02:19:17.683
<i>T-minus 55 minutes and counting.</i>

02:19:17.766 --> 02:19:19.183
I can't believe it didn't work.

02:19:19.268 --> 02:19:20.394
<i>General, I'm in my chute.</i>

02:19:20.519 --> 02:19:21.895
<i>The chamber is still arcing power.</i>

02:19:22.020 --> 02:19:23.021
<i>I don't think it worked.</i>

02:19:24.022 --> 02:19:25.065
- No!
- Hold on!

02:19:42.457 --> 02:19:44.543
Follow me. I'm gonna lead the way.

02:19:49.548 --> 02:19:50.632
Okay, there it is.

02:19:50.757 --> 02:19:52.926
Grab the staff, viviane!

02:19:53.302 --> 02:19:54.636
All right, go!

02:20:07.107 --> 02:20:08.108
Watch out, watch out!

02:20:12.779 --> 02:20:14.448
Stop the time!

02:20:14.656 --> 02:20:16.158
Gonna blow your head off, Megatron!

02:20:16.992 --> 02:20:18.660
Sayonara, bubblehead!

02:20:35.594 --> 02:20:37.304
Megatron, kill her!

02:20:50.776 --> 02:20:53.028
We were brothers once.

02:20:53.153 --> 02:20:54.237
Once.

02:21:21.556 --> 02:21:23.892
We're going weightless. Weightless!

02:21:28.897 --> 02:21:30.565
- Grab my hand.
- Yes!

02:21:40.826 --> 02:21:42.285
Don't let it go!

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.836
Quintessa, get off our planet!

02:21:51.586 --> 02:21:53.422
You traitor!

02:21:56.591 --> 02:21:58.802
Say hello to my friend,

02:21:59.469 --> 02:22:01.430
Bumblebee.

02:22:07.352 --> 02:22:09.604
Sting like a bee.

02:22:27.372 --> 02:22:28.999
I save you!

02:22:35.130 --> 02:22:36.465
I stop the time.

02:23:44.908 --> 02:23:46.743
Is it tomorrow yet?

02:23:51.498 --> 02:23:54.000
<i>At the heart of every legend,</i>

02:23:54.459 --> 02:23:56.128
<i>there is truth.</i>

02:23:58.046 --> 02:24:00.549
<i>A few brave souls unite</i>

02:24:01.466 --> 02:24:03.552
<i>to save their worlds.</i>

02:24:04.511 --> 02:24:06.972
<i>We can be heroes in our own lives,</i>

02:24:08.723 --> 02:24:10.016
<i>every one of us,</i>

02:24:10.392 --> 02:24:14.479
<i>if we only have the courage to try.</i>

02:24:15.230 --> 02:24:17.274
You saved prime.

02:24:18.567 --> 02:24:21.778
<i>Our fates were always intertwined.</i>

02:24:22.237 --> 02:24:26.741
<i>But now our worlds are joined as one.</i>

02:24:27.534 --> 02:24:29.786
<i>We need to repair our planets.</i>

02:24:30.662 --> 02:24:32.247
<i>Work together...</i>

02:24:32.330 --> 02:24:34.958
<i>If we wish to survive.</i>

02:24:36.042 --> 02:24:37.752
Crazy family, huh?

02:24:39.921 --> 02:24:42.424
You did good, bro. Real good.

02:24:44.968 --> 02:24:49.347
<i>A dangerous secret is buried
deep inside the earth.</i>

02:24:50.223 --> 02:24:54.269
<i>There is more to this planet
than meets the eye.</i>

02:24:55.395 --> 02:24:57.689
<i>I am optimus prime,</i>

02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:00.942
<i>calling all autobots.</i>

02:25:01.943 --> 02:25:03.778
<i>It is time</i>

02:25:04.487 --> 02:25:06.489
<i>to come home.</i>

02:25:57.040 --> 02:25:58.250
Are you lost?

02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:03.338
I wouldn't do that.

02:26:04.214 --> 02:26:06.049
Don't touch him.

02:26:07.175 --> 02:26:08.843
He doesn't like it.

02:26:09.552 --> 02:26:11.179
Who doesn't like what?

02:26:12.597 --> 02:26:14.182
Unicron.

02:26:15.350 --> 02:26:17.519
But I could show you how to kill him.
