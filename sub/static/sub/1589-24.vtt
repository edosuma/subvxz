WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.498
- Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...
- Oh, my God.

00:03.530 --> 00:05.168
- What?
- Hanna's been arrested.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.361
Hanna's lavwer
will do his best _
to get her out on bail,

00:07.400 --> 00:09.106
- but it might
not be possible.
- Why?

00:09.140 --> 00:10.505
Tanner found the clothes
Mona was wearing

00:10.540 --> 00:12.770
the day she died,
and Hanna's blood was on them.

00:12.810 --> 00:15.506
Have you talked to Toby
since you got back?

00:15.540 --> 00:18.100
It's not really a good idea,
under the circumstances.

00:18.150 --> 00:22.314
- What can I get for you?
- Actually, I'm looking
for someone, Hanna Marin.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.818
Why are you looking
for Hanna Marin?

00:24.850 --> 00:27.410
My name is Lesli.
I was a friend of Mona's.

00:27.460 --> 00:29.678
Mrs. Van der Wa||_ said
you were trying to find me.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.789
Not just you;
the others.

00:31.830 --> 00:34.128
You girls were there
for Mona, I wasn't.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.457
I want to thank you
for that.

00:35.500 --> 00:38.298
I'm getting a little tired
of memorializing Mona.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.560
Are you saying that
the world's better off
without her?

00:40.600 --> 00:42.602
We're luclq she didn't
get to college and start
thinking about

00:42.640 --> 00:44.062
running for president.

00:44.110 --> 00:46.078
The DA is offering
a plea bargain.

00:46.110 --> 00:49.409
If you plead guilty,
and you take responsibility
for your actions--

00:49.450 --> 00:51.509
I did not kill Mona!

00:52.750 --> 00:55.139
As the trial enters
its second month,

00:55.180 --> 00:57.284
the state's case against
Alison DiLaurentis

00:57.320 --> 01:00.153
the infamous teen accused of
murdering her classmate,

01:00.190 --> 01:02.158
has taken a new turn.

01:02.190 --> 01:04.556
_ Here to tell us more
IS our expert on the case,

01:04.590 --> 01:06.194
Sara Shepard.

01:06.230 --> 01:08.357
Sara, you have been with
this one since the beginning.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.563
Tell me, is this kid
going down, down, down?

01:11.600 --> 01:13.295
She might, Bill.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.365
The DA has painted Alison
as the ultimate mean girl,

01:15.400 --> 01:17.368
and it looks like
one of her classmates

01:17.410 --> 01:19.833
knew that her abduction
was pulp fiction.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.440
The_defe_nse claimed that
Alison IS a scapegoat.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.572
Could she be innocent?

01:23.610 --> 01:25.100
We'll know more today.

01:25.150 --> 01:26.515
The prosecution,
in its rebuttal,

01:26.550 --> 01:28.518
has just announced
a surprise witness.

01:28.550 --> 01:31.747
Surprise witness. That must've
rattled the defense team.

01:31.790 --> 01:33.587
Oh, it's rattled
a lot of people.

01:33.620 --> 01:36.851
Counselor, will you call
your next witness, please?

01:36.890 --> 01:40.394
The Commonwealth calls
Lesli Stone to take the stand.

01:50.770 --> 01:53.603
- I knew she was trouble.
- Where's she been
all this time?

01:53.640 --> 01:56.643
Probably took her a while
to cross the River Styx.

01:56.680 --> 01:59.103
I do.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.388
* Got a secret,
can you keep it *

02:06.420 --> 02:08.684
* Swear this one
you'll save *

02:08.720 --> 02:11.359
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

02:11.390 --> 02:13.756
* Taking this one
to the grave *

02:13.800 --> 02:18.624
* IfI show you then I'll know
you won't tell what I said *

02:18.670 --> 02:23.539
* 'Cause two can keep a secret
if one of them is dead **

02:26.440 --> 02:28.237
So you hadn't seen
your friend since
the school year began,

02:28.280 --> 02:29.838
but you were in
constant communication.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.371
Mona and I talked
on the phone a lot.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.240
We grew very close
last summer.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.770
We texted all the time.

02:35.820 --> 02:37.310
And on one occasion,

02:37.350 --> 02:40.786
Mona actually sent you
a card, correct?

02:40.820 --> 02:43.380
- Yes.
- And in this card,

02:43.430 --> 02:45.728
mailed two weeks
before Thanksgiving,

02:45.760 --> 02:47.250
what did Mona tell you?

02:47.300 --> 02:49.393
She was having
a hard time,

02:49.430 --> 02:51.864
and she had been
threatened by her.

02:51.900 --> 02:55.358
And what was the nature
of this threat?

02:56.440 --> 02:58.408
Ally said if Mona
opened her trap

02:58.440 --> 03:00.931
about the fake kidnapping
that she'd be eaten by worms.

03:00.980 --> 03:02.675
Objection. Hearsay.

03:02.710 --> 03:04.746
The witness is quoting
the victim, Your Honor.

03:04.780 --> 03:06.543
It's all in the card.

03:06.580 --> 03:08.844
Objection overruled.

03:08.880 --> 03:12.759
And why have you decided
to share this card with
us now, Lesli?

03:12.790 --> 03:14.951
I couldn't find it.

03:14.990 --> 03:16.958
It came during midterms,

03:16.990 --> 03:18.480
and I stuck it
in a textbook.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.861
And honestly, I didn't
take it seriously enough.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.424
Why?

03:25.470 --> 03:29.258
Everyone has feuds
in high school.

03:31.270 --> 03:33.977
I didn't realize
what Mona was dealing with

03:34.010 --> 03:36.205
until it was
too late.

03:37.480 --> 03:40.369
And then, when I came
to see her mom, um...

03:43.750 --> 03:45.012
What happened then?

03:45.050 --> 03:47.314
I realized something
weird was going on.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.022
Even though Alison
was already locked up,

03:50.060 --> 03:51.618
her friends were
all on edge

03:51.660 --> 03:53.890
about anyone asking
any questions,

03:53.930 --> 03:55.591
or touching Mona's things.

03:55.630 --> 03:58.622
I was practically attacked
by Mona's boyfriend

03:58.670 --> 04:00.865
for borrowing a book
from her room.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.629
Do you think that
Alison's friends

04:02.670 --> 04:05.730
were hiding something
to protect her?

04:05.770 --> 04:06.998
Yes.

04:07.040 --> 04:10.749
One of them,
Hanna Marin,

04:10.780 --> 04:14.341
wouldn't even let me
go Into Mona's bedroom.

04:14.380 --> 04:17.019
She stalked me the entire
time I was in Rosewood.

04:17.050 --> 04:19.416
- What are you doing?
- Calling Caleb.

04:20.820 --> 04:25.484
Did you share
your observations
with Mona's mother?

04:25.530 --> 04:27.657
If you're on your way there,
tell Hanna

04:27.700 --> 04:30.362
that she just got tossed
under another wheel of the bus.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.039
You should probably
call her mom, but, um...

04:33.070 --> 04:34.958
us first.

04:36.870 --> 04:37.939
Hi.

04:37.970 --> 04:39.835
Hi.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.508
Have they taken
a recess?

04:42.550 --> 04:43.847
No.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.643
No, Ijust...
I did.

04:45.680 --> 04:46.977
It's getting worse.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.045
I've been following
the trial--

04:49.080 --> 04:50.513
I thought I would
hear from you

04:50.550 --> 04:51.847
the second that Hanna
was arrested.

04:51.890 --> 04:53.414
Your mom said
you were In London.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.382
I was, but I came back
as soon as I could.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.082
I couldn't
reach out yet--

04:58.130 --> 04:59.825
Okay, because your boss
is using us

04:59.860 --> 05:02.590
to build a case
against me.
So you've said.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.432
I should probably
get back.

05:08.470 --> 05:10.404
Wait.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.805
How did the interview go?

05:11.840 --> 05:13.705
For Oxford.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.609
Not well.

05:17.650 --> 05:21.438
Um, "A" kind of followed
me to the UK.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.938
Packed some vials of blood
in my bag without me knowing it,

05:24.990 --> 05:27.811
and my purse exploded
and hemorrhaged all over
a 200-year-old chair.

05:27.860 --> 05:30.988
- It was actually horrifying.
- You should've called me.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.554
I was told not to,
remember?

05:32.600 --> 05:34.591
It's fine.

05:34.630 --> 05:37.428
I had a panic attack,
I shredded my carry-on.

05:37.470 --> 05:40.462
I wanted to swing back
to Philadelphia, but, um...

05:42.470 --> 05:44.836
Melissa's roommate
helped me through It.

05:44.870 --> 05:46.735
He was very sweet.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.744
Oh, um...

05:52.780 --> 05:53.974
Hey, Toby.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.442
We need to talk to Hanna,
soon.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.879
Why? What else
did Lesli say?

05:56.920 --> 06:00.083
I can't. There are
barracudas with duller teeth.

06:06.060 --> 06:07.857
Stalked her?
I did not stalk her.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.118
You told me to keep
an eye on her at all times.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.468
I probably would've let her
go to the bathroom by herself.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.036
Who the hell
is Lesli Stone?

06:14.070 --> 06:15.765
I mean, does she go to
our school,

06:15.800 --> 06:17.461
because I've never even
heard her name before today.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.478
She lives with
Mona's grandparents.

06:19.510 --> 06:21.000
Last summer,
they became besties.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.543
A bestie who couldn't
be bothered to go to
her funeral.

06:23.580 --> 06:25.138
Yeah, and somehow dug up
a greeting card

06:25.180 --> 06:27.011
that makes me look like
Squealq Fromme.

06:27.050 --> 06:29.143
But, guys,
what if Lesli's here

06:29.180 --> 06:31.148
on behalf of another friend?

06:31.190 --> 06:32.612
She's not "A's" pawn.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.685
Lesli really cared
about Mona.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.052
That's why she wants
to see All fry.

06:37.090 --> 06:38.626
Ali,

06:38.660 --> 06:39.888
what does your lawyer say
about this?

06:39.930 --> 06:41.750
Guys, we have nothing.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.620
What happened at
the Varjak Trail?

06:43.670 --> 06:45.763
It led us back
to Mona's house,

06:45.800 --> 06:47.893
and this paper filled
with weird phrases.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.932
I need something.
I'm about to get
life in prison

06:50.970 --> 06:53.768
because Mona wanted to use
her last Laurel and Hardy stamp.

06:53.810 --> 06:55.903
Alison, what else
can we do?

06:55.940 --> 06:57.168
We questioned Cyrus,

06:57.210 --> 06:59.178
we hunted down
the pizza box number.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.519
Hanna even tried to tell
Tanner about "A."

07:01.550 --> 07:03.586
You don'_t have
an alibi.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.713
Now you're sounding
like my lawyer.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.183
She thinks going after
a possible witness

07:07.220 --> 07:08.517
is a complete
waste of time.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.221
Wait. What witness?

07:10.260 --> 07:13.798
Someone might have seen me,
on Thanksgiving.

07:13.830 --> 07:16.469
At the playground?
You said that you
didn't see anybody.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.833
I didn't, but I might not
have been there alone.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.717
Where the hell are you?

07:36.750 --> 07:39.446
I've been here for an hour,
and I'm freezing.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.787
[rattling sound]

08:04.750 --> 08:06.968
- Why'd you run?
- I thought it
might've been "A, "

08:07.020 --> 08:08.578
but now I'm not so sure.

08:08.620 --> 08:10.838
So you don't know if
it was a man or a woman.

08:10.890 --> 08:11.982
Or a squirrel.

08:12.020 --> 08:14.784
I saw the jacket,
and...

08:14.820 --> 08:17.721
maybe someone
was sleeping in there.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.149
Look, Ali, maybe
if we went back there--

08:20.200 --> 08:21.656
[buzzing,
line disconnects]

08:21.700 --> 08:23.065
- Hello.
- [busy signal drones]

08:23.100 --> 08:25.660
- What happened?
- Her time's up.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.705
[Mike]
Yeah, I'm coming.

08:40.050 --> 08:43.019
- Where have you been?
- I had a make-up test.

08:43.050 --> 08:45.314
I came back to get
my stuff for practice.
What's going on?

08:45.350 --> 08:47.079
Mona's pal Lesli,
she took the stand today

08:47.120 --> 08:48.917
and she basically
trashed you.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.279
What? I've only met
that girl once.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.286
Well, you're kind
of hard to forget

08:52.330 --> 08:54.628
- when you try to
pinch off someone's head.
- What did she say?

08:54.660 --> 08:57.322
- Did you tell her
that I was--
- No, we can't talk to her.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.895
Aria, if someone's making me
look like I hurt Mona--

08:59.940 --> 09:02.295
Okay, just shut up
and listen to me.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.035
There's a very good chance
that you might get

09:04.070 --> 09:05.105
called in there
to testify.

09:05.140 --> 09:07.233
Bring it on.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.633
I'm ready to talk.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.079
No, no, no, you're not.

09:10.110 --> 09:13.318
Mike, you have to keep
what you know to yourself.

09:13.350 --> 09:15.045
I already made
that mistake.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.911
IfI had gone
to the cops

09:16.950 --> 09:19.089
the night I saw the blood
and told them what Mona
was planning,

09:19.120 --> 09:20.348
she might still be here.

09:20.390 --> 09:22.312
But if you bring up
what Mona did,

09:22.360 --> 09:23.782
who she was helping,

09:23.830 --> 09:25.923
this could come back
to bite you.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.621
It always does.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.318
So, what, you're
asking me to lie
under oath?

09:31.370 --> 09:33.736
No. I'm asking you
to have three answers:

09:33.770 --> 09:36.330
yes, no, and
I don't remember.

09:36.370 --> 09:38.565
You got it?

09:58.760 --> 10:00.227
Did you bring
the paper?

10:00.260 --> 10:01.955
The words_ from
Mona's mirror.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.865
What's the hold-up?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.298
They're just words,
they don't make any sense.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.729
They only come in
two sizes, girls.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.781
Toby, hi.
I'm so glad you're here.

10:30.830 --> 10:33.298
Would you mind doing
a coffee run?

10:37.200 --> 10:38.724
I don't get it.

10:38.770 --> 10:40.135
I have been through
the academy

10:40.170 --> 10:41.933
the same as
every other ofﬁcer In there,

10:41.970 --> 10:44.404
so why am I being asked
to photocopy parking tickets

10:44.440 --> 10:45.998
and fetch lattes

10:46.040 --> 10:49.009
while everybody else
is working on a case?

10:49.040 --> 10:50.746
Am I being punished
for something?

10:50.780 --> 10:52.008
Punished for what?

10:52.050 --> 10:53.745
The night of
the gallery break-in.

10:53.780 --> 10:55.213
Why would you
be punished?

10:55.250 --> 10:56.740
You made an arrest.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.759
When I ask you to go
for a coffee run,

10:59.790 --> 11:02.315
it's because many of
the officers are on
back-to-backs.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.056
I just thought it would
be nice to have fresh coffee.

11:12.370 --> 11:14.759
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.859
Mom put your dinner
in the fridge.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.176
- What's that?
- It was on the porch.

11:20.210 --> 11:22.201
Looks like
photo supplies.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.470
Why are you suddenly
in charge of all this?
You're not even on yearbook.

11:24.510 --> 11:27.445
'Cause Mom thinks that
asking students to wipe
lipstick from their teeth

11:27.480 --> 11:29.812
will distract me
from the trial.

11:29.850 --> 11:31.340
Hand me your keys,
would you?

11:37.030 --> 11:39.453
Aria.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.220
I can't keep this
to myself.

11:42.260 --> 11:45.468
I could help
Hanna and Alison
ifI told the police.

11:45.500 --> 11:46.467
The longer
that I wait--

11:46.500 --> 11:49.367
Mike, stop. Please.

11:59.380 --> 12:01.018
What's that smell?

12:02.120 --> 12:03.712
Chemicals?

12:07.520 --> 12:10.250
- What the hell?
- [gaSPSI

12:10.290 --> 12:12.087
Is that a tongue?

12:12.130 --> 12:13.825
Oh, my God.

12:13.860 --> 12:15.828
Put it down.
Mike, put it down.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.090
- Who sent this to you?
- Who do you think?

12:18.130 --> 12:20.234
Now do you get it?
This gift was for you.

12:20.270 --> 12:22.932
The next time, it's gonna be
your tongue on the porch.

12:25.010 --> 12:26.409
Mike?

12:28.480 --> 12:30.402
Is everything all right?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.270
Yeah. Everything's fine.

12:32.310 --> 12:34.949
Mike, go eat dinner
and we'll talk later.

12:47.030 --> 12:48.452
- So when did this happen?
- Last night.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.297
It was left out
on my front porch.

12:50.330 --> 12:53.060
- My mother could've
opened that box.
- I wish she had.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.534
Aria, if you
and your brother
are being threatened,

12:55.570 --> 12:57.265
you need to take
that little gift
to the police.

12:57.310 --> 13:01.531
Hanna made that mistake,
and now she's sitting
behind bars.

13:01.580 --> 13:04.447
Look, Ezra, I'm here
because you get it.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.914
You know what
we're up agaInst.

13:07.920 --> 13:09.444
So will you do it or not?

13:09.480 --> 13:11.289
Aria, even if I can
get him out of town,

13:11.320 --> 13:12.912
I can't stop him
from showing up

13:12.960 --> 13:15.087
to court if he's
been subpoenaed.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.883
- I can't hide him.
- I understand.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.886
But it's a long drive
up to your cabin,

13:18.930 --> 13:20.420
so you can at least
explain to him

13:20.460 --> 13:23.167
why it is not necessary
to volunteer dangerous
information.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.895
What about your parents?
What do they say?

13:24.930 --> 13:26.227
They're worried about Mike.

13:26.270 --> 13:27.999
They're totally up for him
getting out of town.

13:33.410 --> 13:35.207
You know what.
Forget It.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.471
I came here because
I didn't know who else
to go to.

13:38.510 --> 13:41.616
Don't read silence
as a "no."

13:41.650 --> 13:44.448
I'm just trying to wrap
my head around this.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.550
You and Mike
or you and me?

13:51.090 --> 13:53.320
I'll pick him up at 4:00.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.521
[sighs]

14:10.280 --> 14:12.145
Does Alison know
we're doing this?
Did you talk to her?

14:12.180 --> 14:16.139
No, I didn't want
to get her hopes up.
Or Hanna's.

14:31.570 --> 14:34.232
Can I help you?

14:34.270 --> 14:36.238
Um, yeah. Maybe.

14:36.270 --> 14:37.532
We were just
looking for somebody.

14:37.570 --> 14:39.435
Playing hide-and-seek?

14:39.470 --> 14:42.007
Yeah. Sorta.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.641
Um, listen,

14:45.680 --> 14:47.910
this might sound
a little bit crazy,

14:47.950 --> 14:49.178
but we're just looking
to talk to anybody

14:49.220 --> 14:51.245
who might spend
a lot of time here.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.110
That would be me.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.650
Yeah, my group comes up here
a couple of times a month.

14:54.690 --> 14:56.112
Our church
boughtthelot

14:56.160 --> 14:59.323
Have you ever seen
anyone sleeping in here?

14:59.360 --> 15:01.396
Or somebody who might spend
a lot of time here by themselves

15:01.430 --> 15:02.692
during the day?

15:02.730 --> 15:05.392
I've never seen anyone
else up here besides us.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.136
But if you're trying
to help the homeless,

15:07.170 --> 15:08.535
we're doing a really neat
Easter supper.

15:08.570 --> 15:09.969
We could always use
more volunteers.

15:11.570 --> 15:13.208
Thank you.

15:14.610 --> 15:17.272
You're actually only
allowed 26 words,

15:17.310 --> 15:20.313
but if you need
any editing suggestions...

15:24.720 --> 15:26.449
Perfect. Thanks.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.310
Ah, Molly Borman's ready.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.025
VVhoa!

15:32.060 --> 15:33.425
Wow, you scared me.

15:33.460 --> 15:34.427
You never
called me back.

15:34.460 --> 15:36.428
Last night?

15:36.460 --> 15:38.291
Oh, yeah.

15:38.330 --> 15:40.560
I'm sorry, there was...
family stuff.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.158
What's going on?
This about Mike?

15:42.200 --> 15:44.031
Yeah, I asked Ezra
to get him out of town

15:44.070 --> 15:45.731
for a couple of days.

15:45.770 --> 15:48.034
The trial is starting
to mess with his head.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.469
You asked Ezra for help?
I thought you and he were--

15:50.510 --> 15:52.046
No, we are.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.741
But we're
still friends,

15:53.780 --> 15:56.169
and he bonded with Mike
after Mona's memorial.

15:56.220 --> 15:57.710
I could bond
with Mike, too.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.308
You don't need
a teaching degree for that.

15:59.350 --> 16:00.749
I know,

16:00.790 --> 16:03.054
but he's got a cabin
up in the Poconos,

16:03.090 --> 16:05.081
so my parents are comfortable
with him taking Mike up there.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.621
I see.
He's got Mom and Pop
on his side, too.

16:07.660 --> 16:10.390
Andrew, it's not
a competition.

16:10.430 --> 16:12.318
I have a lot of history
with Ezra,

16:12.370 --> 16:13.735
so if he wants
to be there for me...

16:13.770 --> 16:15.465
I've offered the same.

16:15.500 --> 16:19.504
Somehow, you don't
hear it when I say
I'm here 24/7.

16:19.540 --> 16:22.100
Um, Aria?

16:26.380 --> 16:28.211
I hear you, okay?

16:28.250 --> 16:29.649
I do.

16:33.320 --> 16:36.380
Hi. Can I see
your form?
Thanks.

16:36.420 --> 16:39.082
Showing up now seems a little
convenient, doesn't it?

16:39.130 --> 16:41.121
This chick gets a letter
from a pal

16:41.160 --> 16:42.491
claiming a death threat,

16:42.530 --> 16:44.225
and she never mentions it
to the cops for months.

16:44.270 --> 16:45.567
Can we not talk
about that?

16:45.600 --> 16:46.760
She's making you
and your friends

16:46.800 --> 16:48.233
look like a coven of witches.

16:48.270 --> 16:50.158
I know.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.302
Do you?

16:51.340 --> 16:54.229
Because you need
somebody to stand up
in that courtroom

16:54.280 --> 16:55.804
and tell the jury
the truth,

16:55.840 --> 16:58.240
before that four-eyed freak
whips out some fake picture

16:58.280 --> 17:01.113
of you stashing a weapon
in Mona's sock drawer.

17:01.150 --> 17:03.243
Do not put it
past her.

17:03.290 --> 17:06.316
Look, I only get to see you
for 30 minutes.

17:06.350 --> 17:09.410
I don't want to spend
28 of them talking about this.

17:13.860 --> 17:15.589
What about Mike?

17:15.630 --> 17:18.190
I mean, he's still sitting on
a hell of a story, Hanna.

17:18.230 --> 17:19.788
- Leave him out of it.
- Why?

17:19.830 --> 17:21.388
Because he's a kid.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.135
If he talks,
that means two more years

17:23.170 --> 17:24.706
of high school
being tortured by "A."

17:24.740 --> 17:26.833
No, not if Mike
opens his mouth

17:26.870 --> 17:29.179
and send the cops
looking for the right person.

17:34.580 --> 17:36.741
What am I supposed to do?

17:38.720 --> 17:41.450
How am I gonna
help you, Hanna?

17:41.490 --> 17:44.288
Do you really want me
to just show up here
twice a week,

17:44.330 --> 17:46.480
and tell you what I thought
was funny on South Park?

17:48.660 --> 17:51.128
I can't even hold
your frickin' hand.

17:53.470 --> 17:56.291
I love you, Hanna,

17:56.340 --> 17:58.365
and I'm...

17:58.410 --> 18:00.708
I'm not gonna
just walk away.

18:00.740 --> 18:02.776
I'm not gonna leave you.

18:02.810 --> 18:05.643
That's just never
gonna happen.

18:05.680 --> 18:08.342
So Mike needs
to speak up.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.219
He's just a kid.

18:19.490 --> 18:21.094
What?

18:28.240 --> 18:29.730
[965%]
Oh, my God!

18:29.770 --> 18:31.465
Wait. Let me ask
the questIons, okay?

18:31.510 --> 18:33.330
You can be aggressive
sometimes.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.302
I don't want
to scare her.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.219
Hey.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.343
I'm Emily.
This is Spencer.

18:42.380 --> 18:43.517
Hi.

18:43.550 --> 18:45.347
We noticed that patch
on your jacket.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.381
We were wondering if
you were part of
the youth group.

18:47.420 --> 18:49.888
- Why?
- Did you ever spend time
at River Road playground?

18:49.920 --> 18:52.627
Um, we're looking for
someone who might've
been there on Thanksgiving.

18:52.660 --> 18:56.619
- I wasn't.
- Okay, well, one of
our friends was,

18:56.660 --> 18:59.220
and she heard...
thought she might've
heard someone

18:59.270 --> 19:00.794
who would've
seen her that night.

19:00.840 --> 19:01.932
So I just wanna
ask you if...

19:01.970 --> 19:03.562
You told her.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.238
You promised you wouldn't,
and you told your daughter.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.807
How else would they know?

19:20.560 --> 19:21.652
Hey.

19:21.690 --> 19:23.328
Have you heard
from Mike?

19:23.360 --> 19:25.851
He called when they were
near Stroudsburg,

19:25.890 --> 19:27.426
but his phone
cut out.

19:27.460 --> 19:29.553
Yeah, well, the service
is spotty up there,

19:29.600 --> 19:31.727
but they've got
a land line at the cabin.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.567
Good.
What's all this?

19:33.600 --> 19:37.661
Just trying to find a quote
for my yearbook picture.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.735
That shouldn't
be too hard.

19:39.770 --> 19:41.931
You've had an eventful
four years.

19:41.980 --> 19:44.574
Maybe something from Hamlet.

19:44.610 --> 19:46.578
Yeah, or Frankenstein.

19:48.750 --> 19:51.947
Aria, Emily and Spencer
had no right

19:51.990 --> 19:53.457
to corner that poor girl.

19:53.490 --> 19:55.412
Once again, Mom,
they did not corner her.

19:55.460 --> 19:56.950
We are just trying
to find someone

19:56.990 --> 19:58.685
who can back up
Alison's story

19:58.730 --> 19:59.981
and prove that she
wasn't in Rosewood
that day.

20:00.030 --> 20:01.691
You are not on
her defense team.

20:01.730 --> 20:03.561
Why won't you tell me
why that girl freaked out

20:03.600 --> 20:04.828
and turned on you?

20:04.870 --> 20:08.362
Kendra is a good kid
who made a big mistake,

20:08.400 --> 20:10.960
and I promised
to keep her secret.
It's that simple.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.409
What kind of big mistake?

20:13.610 --> 20:17.569
I've got two friends that are
sitting in jail right now,

20:17.610 --> 20:20.477
and this person
might be able to help them.

20:23.550 --> 20:27.213
Kendra went to a party
the night before Thanksgiving.

20:28.490 --> 20:31.459
She didn't know
the other kids,
and she got nervous.

20:31.490 --> 20:35.449
She experimented with
some drug that was
cut with speed,

20:35.500 --> 20:37.024
and had
a very bad reaction.

20:37.060 --> 20:39.597
She was worried
that her parents
would figure out

20:39.630 --> 20:40.790
she was high as a kite,

20:40.840 --> 20:43.331
and there'd be
hell to pay.

20:43.370 --> 20:45.406
So she hid out
at a playground

20:45.440 --> 20:48.477
until she was sober
enough to go home
and pass the cranberries.

20:48.510 --> 20:50.501
Why would she
tell you this?

20:50.550 --> 20:54.338
You'd be surprised
what students confide
to their favorite teachers.

20:54.380 --> 20:56.018
Or maybe you wouldn't.

20:56.050 --> 20:57.688
Did she see Alison
that day?

20:57.720 --> 20:59.608
'Cause if she was
at the playground--

20:59.650 --> 21:02.016
She didn't mention
seeing anybody else.

21:02.060 --> 21:03.618
And why are you so sure

21:03.660 --> 21:05.628
that Alison was where
she said she was?

21:05.660 --> 21:07.628
You need to separate
yourself from her.

21:07.660 --> 21:09.628
And what about Hanna?

21:09.660 --> 21:11.491
Am I just supposed
to abandon her, too?

21:11.530 --> 21:13.964
Kendra's not the only
good kid out there

21:14.000 --> 21:16.389
_who's made
a bIg mIstake, Mom.

21:26.550 --> 21:28.518
That took a lot longer
than I thought.

21:28.550 --> 21:31.519
Takes about two hours.
Your SIster usually falls
asleep.

21:31.550 --> 21:33.415
How often
does she come up?

21:33.460 --> 21:34.916
She...

21:34.960 --> 21:36.382
What the hell
are you doing?

21:36.420 --> 21:37.728
I thought you might
be freaked out

21:37.760 --> 21:38.988
if you saw a light on.

21:39.030 --> 21:40.452
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey, how's it going?

21:40.500 --> 21:41.853
Can we skip
the greetings, please?

21:41.900 --> 21:43.049
What are you doing
here, Caleb?

21:43.100 --> 21:44.965
I'm here for
a reality check.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.389
Look, your sister
is very scared,

21:47.440 --> 21:48.691
and she gave you
bad advice.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.799
There are a lot of people
relying on you.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.535
You need to come
back with me
and tell the truth.

21:52.570 --> 21:54.538
Whoa. Stop.
We just got here.

21:54.580 --> 21:57.071
The only thing we're doing
is taking off our jackets,

21:57.110 --> 21:58.805
heating up a frozen pizza,

21:58.850 --> 22:00.738
and if you calm down,
we might even offer you a slice.

22:00.780 --> 22:03.419
You know, I'm good.
While it's defrosting,

22:03.450 --> 22:05.088
we're gonna be in Scranton.
Let's go, Mike.

22:05.120 --> 22:07.554
You can't just throw him
in the back of your car
like a pair of boots.

22:07.590 --> 22:09.410
This is a big decision
to make.

22:09.460 --> 22:11.382
Yeah, and I made it.

22:12.930 --> 22:14.625
I wanna go back.

22:14.660 --> 22:17.823
Mike, stop. Do not
be reckless with this.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.690
You have a target
on your back,

22:19.730 --> 22:20.958
and I know you wanna
do the right thing.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.558
Yeah, I do.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.033
Which is coming back
and telling what he knows.

22:24.070 --> 22:25.628
He's right.

22:25.670 --> 22:28.332
I need to do this.
This is not gonna go away.

22:29.540 --> 22:31.576
Okay, fine.
Would you mind
getting the bags

22:31.610 --> 22:33.749
out of the back
of the car?

22:39.490 --> 22:40.787
You are messing
with his head.

22:40.820 --> 22:43.755
- Good. He's not
made of glass.
- He's 16.

22:43.790 --> 22:45.985
You know what? We all
have crap that we need to face

22:46.030 --> 22:47.759
that we don't feel ready for.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.121
Hanna is locked in a cage
with people who could kill her

22:50.160 --> 22:52.025
- with a comb.
- Oh, that's not fair.

22:52.070 --> 22:53.731
What is fair?

22:53.770 --> 22:56.591
When I was his age,
I was sleeping on the street,

22:56.640 --> 22:59.632
and trying to stretch
$11 to last me a week.

22:59.670 --> 23:03.003
So, what, simply because
your life was hard,
his has to be, too?

23:03.040 --> 23:06.601
No, but life doesn't get
easier by avoiding things.

23:06.650 --> 23:09.039
I guess you didn't learn that
up on the horsey estate.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.889
You wanna drag
the kid back?

23:10.920 --> 23:12.512
Fine. Then what?

23:12.550 --> 23:14.552
Are you gonna be there
for him in the fallout?

23:14.590 --> 23:16.478
Or is it only Hanna
you care about?

23:16.520 --> 23:20.490
The kid is ready to put on
his big-boy pants,

23:20.530 --> 23:21.895
and offer up
a little insight.

23:21.930 --> 23:24.160
Otherwise, I will.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.896
[car starting]

23:26.930 --> 23:29.160
Mike!

23:29.200 --> 23:31.168
Will you drink
tomato juice?

23:31.210 --> 23:32.700
Whatever. I don't care.

23:32.740 --> 23:35.504
Actually, you might.
This could be sauce.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.030
That girl will
never talk to us.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.968
And if Aria's mom
won't help us,

23:39.010 --> 23:41.171
we have to ask Toby.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.541
He's a policeman, Spencer.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.046
And if Kendra's
such a good girl,

23:45.090 --> 23:46.978
she's not gonna lie
to someone wearing
that uniform.

23:47.020 --> 23:51.184
Just please forget
about Toby.

23:51.230 --> 23:53.721
What happened
between you two
in that stairwell?

23:53.760 --> 23:56.695
Nothing. We danced
around the fact

23:56.730 --> 23:58.789
that I basically dated
two other guys.

23:58.830 --> 24:00.195
Whoa, back up.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.788
What do you mean, dated?

24:01.840 --> 24:04.058
Okay, stop looking at me
like I'm the town pump.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.237
There were a_few
spontaneous kIsses,
that's all.

24:06.270 --> 24:09.933
- Who kissed who?
- Does it matter? _
I wasn't unconSCIous, EmIIy.

24:09.980 --> 24:12.107
And honestly, it felt
really good to be with somebody

24:12.150 --> 24:13.572
who wanted to be with me.

24:15.520 --> 24:19.115
Something that Toby hasn't
wanted since he put on
that stupid uniform.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.649
- Closed mouth or open?
- Drink your sauce.

24:25.060 --> 24:27.597
[knocking on door]

24:34.170 --> 24:35.990
Mrs. Montgomery called me.

24:37.170 --> 24:39.138
We need to talk.

25:13.910 --> 25:16.708
Let's get a dustpan,
unless you gonna lick it up.

25:22.050 --> 25:24.280
- I've been studying
the paper--
- Two minutes, ladies.

25:24.320 --> 25:27.141
Forget the paper.
There was someone there
in the playground that day.

25:27.190 --> 25:28.885
They found her.

25:28.920 --> 25:32.048
[guard] What's going on here?
Everyone back to your stations.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.836
My God, Alison,
what are you doing?

25:41.870 --> 25:43.189
We can talk in
the infirmary.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.901
- Slam your hand in there.
- What?!

25:44.940 --> 25:46.532
Just do it.

25:49.810 --> 25:52.301
- Hurry.
- I can't do it.

25:52.350 --> 25:55.547
- I can't do it.
- Hold still.

26:01.020 --> 26:02.681
- How did this happen?
- It was an accident.

26:02.720 --> 26:05.325
It wasn't an accident
last time, Alison.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.999
_ If_ someone here
Is stIII harassmg you...

26:08.030 --> 26:09.292
This was an accident.

26:13.270 --> 26:15.135
What happened
to you?

26:15.170 --> 26:17.092
She slammed her hand.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.801
- In a dryer.
- Really?

26:18.840 --> 26:21.877
Is this the first time
you gIrls have done laundry?

26:35.720 --> 26:38.086
Where do you two
think you are?

26:38.130 --> 26:39.688
Homeroom detention?

26:39.730 --> 26:42.119
This is a murder
trial, ladies.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.219
And trying to defend someone
who thinks she can

26:44.270 --> 26:46.761
manipulate the system
is a challenge

26:46.800 --> 26:48.734
I never agreed to take on.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.004
Give me the note.

26:53.140 --> 26:55.677
Give it to me.

27:05.420 --> 27:07.012
What is this?

27:08.890 --> 27:12.758
I have an urgent message
on my phone from your buddies.

27:12.790 --> 27:16.021
Better not be _
another manIpulatIon.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.774
Mike.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.048
Mike!

27:41.260 --> 27:42.955
Ezra.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.419
How long were you
out there?

27:49.460 --> 27:51.769
1:00 pm,
2:00 pm?

27:51.800 --> 27:53.427
Something like that.

27:53.470 --> 27:55.438
2:00.

27:55.470 --> 27:59.668
And you were in
the pipe the whole time?

28:00.740 --> 28:02.173
Did you ever see
anyone walk by?

28:02.210 --> 28:03.802
No.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.442
But she heard a voice.
You heard a voice, right?

28:05.480 --> 28:07.038
Emily?

28:07.080 --> 28:08.308
I got this.

28:08.350 --> 28:10.170
Did you hear a voice?

28:10.220 --> 28:12.040
-_ Yes. _
- A gIrl's v0Ice.

28:12.090 --> 28:13.682
Sorry.

28:14.490 --> 28:16.048
Who was she
talking to?

28:16.090 --> 28:18.923
Sounded like she was
on the phone.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.155
And do you recall
what she said?

28:22.900 --> 28:26.097
Not really.
My heart was pounding.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.796
Thank you for
stepping forward, Kendra.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.330
If we need anything
else, we'll call you.

28:31.370 --> 28:33.930
Wait, no,
why is she leaving?

28:33.980 --> 28:36.130
Because it's 9:15
on a school night,

28:36.180 --> 28:39.479
and I'm betting that
Kendra has algebra homework.
Good night.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.341
But that's not
the end of her story.

28:41.380 --> 28:44.747
- She heard Alison
get In her car.
- It's been a long day, ladies.

28:44.790 --> 28:47.384
But if Kendra doesn't know
what you'll be asking her
on the stand...

28:47.420 --> 28:49.479
I'm not putting Kendra
on the stand.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.078
- What?!
- Why?

28:51.130 --> 28:53.086
No jury is going to be
swayed by a witness

28:53.130 --> 28:54.995
who earlier in the day
saw eight fingers

28:55.030 --> 28:56.349
on one hand,

28:56.400 --> 28:58.823
and was picking up NPR
through her cavity fillings.

28:58.870 --> 29:00.223
We are not that desperate.

29:00.270 --> 29:03.091
- Yes, we are.
- We don't have
anybody else.

29:03.140 --> 29:04.960
Yes, we do.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.932
I'm putting Alison
on the stand.

29:17.150 --> 29:19.118
Mike!

29:19.150 --> 29:20.412
Mike.

29:20.450 --> 29:22.156
Mike!

29:25.560 --> 29:27.050
What is this place?

29:27.090 --> 29:28.796
I think it's
some sort of...

29:28.830 --> 29:30.525
scout camp.
Pathfinders.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.768
Are there cabins?
Maybe he's hiding.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.089
What the hell?

29:40.040 --> 29:41.530
- Do you see anything?
- No.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.229
Holy crap!

29:48.920 --> 29:51.241
What_the hell
Is gomg on?

29:53.490 --> 29:55.151
- Get down.
- Did you see anybody?

29:55.190 --> 29:56.657
To the left, I think.

30:00.530 --> 30:02.452
I can't see 'em.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.094
Let's go.

30:06.330 --> 30:08.093
Can I come in?

30:13.410 --> 30:14.934
What's going on?

30:16.610 --> 30:18.168
I have done a lot
to get that.

30:18.210 --> 30:21.316
I got my butt kicked
in the academy for it.

30:21.350 --> 30:23.614
I fought with my dad
about it.

30:23.650 --> 30:25.242
I even got a buzz cut.

30:25.290 --> 30:28.453
I did it because I was
tired of not being able

30:28.490 --> 30:31.584
to protect the one person
in this world that
matters most to me.

30:31.630 --> 30:33.222
And I am not gonna
choose, Spencer.

30:33.260 --> 30:34.921
I'm not gonna choose
between it and you.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.190
- I never asked you to.
- I know.

30:37.230 --> 30:38.925
But Tanner has.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.323
And that's why
I'm gonna tell her

30:40.370 --> 30:43.464
if she's not okay with me
being with you,

30:43.500 --> 30:45.104
and being a cop,

30:45.140 --> 30:47.973
then she's gonna have
to kick me off the force.

32:03.080 --> 32:06.686
[phone ringing,
voicemail beeps]

32:06.720 --> 32:08.153
Ezra, where are you guys?

32:08.190 --> 32:10.010
Why is nobody picking up
the land line?

32:10.060 --> 32:11.925
Call me when you
get this, please.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.604
Hey, Andrew, it's me.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.176
I thought that
you'd be home.

32:32.210 --> 32:35.247
Listen, if you meant
the whole 24/7 thing,

32:35.280 --> 32:38.716
I'd, um, I'd really
like you to take a drive

32:38.750 --> 32:40.445
up to the cabin where
Mike is staying.

32:40.490 --> 32:44.119
I can't get a hold of him
or Ezra or anybody,

32:44.160 --> 32:45.718
and I just know
that something's wrong,

32:45.760 --> 32:48.422
and I need your help.
Thank you.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.375
Oh, my God.
Mike.

33:07.310 --> 33:09.540
- No, wait, wait.
- What are you doing?

33:09.580 --> 33:11.514
Getting proof.

33:16.120 --> 33:19.624
[Marcus] These stills were
taken from the vicious
attack on Mona.

33:19.660 --> 33:22.754
As the forensics
expert testIerd,

33:22.800 --> 33:24.563
the assailant
hurled the victim

33:24.600 --> 33:26.227
with considerable force,

33:26.270 --> 33:30.161
strength that came from
the assailant's right arm.

33:31.840 --> 33:35.298
Alison, will you please
toss that to me?

33:35.340 --> 33:36.773
I'm gonna back up
a little bit.

33:36.810 --> 33:39.244
Objection. Where's counsel
going with this?

33:39.280 --> 33:41.373
Are we gonna watch
the defendant skip rope, too?

33:41.420 --> 33:44.685
Ms. Marcus, I don't like
edible objects

33:44.720 --> 33:46.312
thrown in my courtroom.

33:46.350 --> 33:48.818
Please, Your Honor,
I'm building a foundation.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.282
Get on with it.

33:50.320 --> 33:54.154
Alison, toss that
to me over here.

33:55.430 --> 33:57.421
Again, please.

34:00.570 --> 34:02.231
And one more time.

34:06.310 --> 34:11.600
Was that last pass
painful because of
the recent burn to that arm?

34:11.650 --> 34:13.208
No, ma'am.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.844
My elbow,
this part of my arm,

34:15.880 --> 34:19.145
_ I once broke it
and It never completely healed.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.212
Around three maybe.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.854
You were just over
two-and-a-half.

34:25.890 --> 34:28.450
And I have doctors'
reports that show

34:28.500 --> 34:31.424
that the fracture
never healed properly.

34:31.470 --> 34:34.439
Ladies and gentlemen,
this victim

34:34.470 --> 34:36.768
was slammed
agaInst the wall.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.564
Hurled like a rag doll,

34:39.610 --> 34:43.239
something that Alison
isn't even capable of doing

34:43.280 --> 34:46.204
with a one-pound
grapefruit.

34:49.350 --> 34:52.444
So you can't give me
an exact time this occurred,

34:52.490 --> 34:55.118
but you believe it happened
between 10:00 and midnight.

34:55.160 --> 34:58.721
How tail was
this individual,
approximately?

34:58.760 --> 35:00.523
I already told you.

35:00.560 --> 35:03.449
Mike's vision was impaired,
and we couldn't see anybody.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.263
It was dark.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.892
So neither of you
can tell me the sex,
the height,

35:06.930 --> 35:09.239
or the hair color
of this individual.

35:09.270 --> 35:10.589
No.

35:10.640 --> 35:13.200
In fact, you can't
even be sure

35:13.240 --> 35:15.128
whether it was more
than one individual.

35:15.180 --> 35:20.243
Is this the same information
you gave the sherIff In
Allegheny County?

35:21.380 --> 35:24.543
Um, no, because we came
straight here,

35:24.590 --> 35:26.478
because we figured
it was connected.

35:26.520 --> 35:29.785
You have to file it
in the county where
the incident occurred.

35:29.820 --> 35:31.754
Un-frickin'-believable.

35:31.790 --> 35:33.883
This town has it
so ass-bacloNards,

35:33.930 --> 35:35.898
I cannot...

35:35.930 --> 35:38.228
Okay, don't you get it?

35:38.270 --> 35:40.761
There is somebody after us.

35:40.800 --> 35:43.530
The same person who went after
Hanna Marin and her friends

35:43.570 --> 35:45.538
did this.

35:46.670 --> 35:48.228
So just to be clear,

35:48.280 --> 35:50.635
instead of helping
untie your friend,

35:50.680 --> 35:52.545
you stopped
to take a photo.

35:53.950 --> 35:56.373
It's kind of
an odd reaction,

35:56.420 --> 35:58.285
don't you think?

36:01.420 --> 36:02.785
Alison, I'm sorry.

36:02.820 --> 36:05.926
Frankly surprised
to hear about your injury

36:05.960 --> 36:08.554
at this late
juncture.

36:08.600 --> 36:12.696
Did this prevent you from
participating in your school's
PE program?

36:12.730 --> 36:14.266
No, sir.

36:14.300 --> 36:16.939
Have you had to steer away
from certain sports?

36:16.970 --> 36:18.460
Yes, I have.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.535
What about summers
at sleep-away camp?

36:20.570 --> 36:23.277
Did that weak arm
keep you from taking

36:23.310 --> 36:25.847
electives like archery?

36:27.880 --> 36:30.269
Shall I repeat
the question?

36:30.320 --> 36:31.742
Did you take archery?

36:31.790 --> 36:33.417
I don't remember.

36:33.450 --> 36:35.554
Well, let's
refresh your memory.

36:35.590 --> 36:39.321
You not only took it,
you were darn good at it.

36:40.790 --> 36:42.428
Can you explain
to the jury

36:42.460 --> 36:44.223
how you managed to beat out
every camper

36:44.270 --> 36:45.692
when the contest
reqUIres shootIng at

36:45.730 --> 36:49.461
five separate targets
from the same spot?

36:50.740 --> 36:51.866
Alison?

36:51.910 --> 36:54.208
[phones buzzing]

36:56.880 --> 36:58.768
Your Honor, can you
instruct the witness

36:58.810 --> 37:00.698
to answer the question?

37:00.750 --> 37:05.881
Miss DiLaurentis, please
answer Mr. Sirk's question.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.454
Counselor, would you please
repeat the question

37:09.490 --> 37:11.549
for the witness?

37:24.510 --> 37:26.000
Lieutenant, I need
to speak with you.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.905
Toby, you should not
have come in here today.

37:27.940 --> 37:29.476
It's about Spencer Hastings.

37:29.510 --> 37:31.740
There is nothing you can do.
It is too late.

37:31.780 --> 37:32.769
Too late for what?

37:32.810 --> 37:35.540
To help her or her friends.

37:35.580 --> 37:37.514
They chose to help
the wrong person.

37:37.550 --> 37:39.518
Please make sure
the door IS closed

37:39.550 --> 37:41.415
and locked
when I'm gone.

37:57.670 --> 37:59.763
Hey.

37:59.810 --> 38:02.836
The jury may be
deliberating for some time.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.041
There's a private room
down the hall.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.344
I'm fine.

38:08.550 --> 38:11.383
Where's your dad?

38:11.420 --> 38:13.684
He and Jason
went to get food.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.451
I'm still too nervous
to eat.

38:20.830 --> 38:22.923
Honestly, I'm mystified.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.825
They had one hour
for lunch,

38:24.870 --> 38:28.465
and they managed to dig up
an award you won when
you were 11 years old.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.661
I didn't even win it.

38:30.700 --> 38:31.769
What do you mean?

38:33.440 --> 38:35.476
I talked my bunkmate
into sinking the arrows

38:35.510 --> 38:37.603
before I even
picked up the bow.

38:38.910 --> 38:40.468
We rigged it.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.986
It's too late to tell
the truth now, huh?

39:00.470 --> 39:04.429
Hey. Sorry I couldn't
get here earlier.
How are you doing?

39:04.470 --> 39:06.631
Kind of a mess, actually.

39:07.870 --> 39:09.474
Where were you last night?

39:09.510 --> 39:11.444
I called you
a bunch of times.

39:11.480 --> 39:12.708
- Did you get my messages?
- Yeah, I'm an idiot.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.570
I was rushing to finish
my yearbook page,

39:14.620 --> 39:15.848
and my phone must've died.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.711
Why are you
sitting in here?

39:17.750 --> 39:21.015
It's either here
or the parking lot.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.016
I hate this.
I hate waiting.

39:24.060 --> 39:26.858
Can I wait with you?

39:26.890 --> 39:28.619
Yeah.

39:36.670 --> 39:39.730
Hey, where's that
yearbook form?

39:39.770 --> 39:41.032
Uh...

39:42.180 --> 39:43.477
I could actually
use your help.

39:43.510 --> 39:45.774
I can't decide
what to cut.

39:50.650 --> 39:51.878
What?

39:51.920 --> 39:54.514
I mean, I know you're
a nice guy and all,

39:54.560 --> 39:56.016
but I didn't
know you were

39:56.060 --> 39:58.620
an award-winning
Pathfinder scout.
Geez.

39:58.660 --> 40:00.025
Twelve years.

40:00.060 --> 40:03.450
You never know when
those skI||s are gonna
come in handy.

40:22.680 --> 40:28.414
* Now hope is lying
on broken glass *

40:31.830 --> 40:37.996
* The shattered hope,
the scattered past *

40:38.030 --> 40:41.591
Have you reached a verdict?

40:43.140 --> 40:44.505
We have, Your Honor.

40:48.580 --> 40:49.877
In the case of

40:49.910 --> 40:52.708
the Commonwealth
v. Alison DiLaurentis,

40:52.750 --> 40:54.741
we, the jury,
find the defendant

40:54.780 --> 40:57.943
guilty of murder
in the first degree.

40:57.980 --> 41:02.553
* Everything is gone

41:02.590 --> 41:06.686
* And this nightmare's
closing in *

41:06.730 --> 41:10.222
* Everything is lost

41:10.260 --> 41:11.761
Order.

41:11.800 --> 41:15.588
* There's a sor_row
beneath my skIn *

41:15.640 --> 41:19.838
* This is the end

41:19.870 --> 41:24.569
*Ofme

41:24.610 --> 41:29.570
* This is the end

41:29.620 --> 41:33.647
*Ofme

41:33.690 --> 41:38.855
* Everything is lost

41:38.890 --> 41:43.020
* And this nightmare's
closing in *

41:43.060 --> 41:47.861
* This is the end

41:47.900 --> 41:50.266
*Ofme*

41:50.300 --> 41:54.066
* Do you know
where you're going to? *

41:54.110 --> 41:59.798
* Do you like the things
that life is showing you? *

41:59.850 --> 42:03.616
* Where are you going to?

42:03.650 --> 42:06.084
* Do you know?

42:06.120 --> 42:09.749
* Do you get
what you're hoping for? *

42:09.790 --> 42:15.057
* When you look behind you,
there's no open door *

42:15.100 --> 42:18.627
* What are you hoping for?

42:18.670 --> 42:20.695
* Do you know? *
