WEBVTT

00:11.960 --> 00:15.839
Tequila, checkbook, sourpuss.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.915
Must be alimony time.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.351
Go away, Charlie.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.548
Boy, you'd think for all that money, she'd
at least come and give you a lap dance.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.196
- Leave me alone, Charlie.
- In fact, you know what'd be funny?

00:29.360 --> 00:31.920
Where it says "memo,"
write "lap dance."

00:32.560 --> 00:35.233
Give her something to explain
at tax time.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.919
Charlie, you...

00:38.840 --> 00:40.432
Okay.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.036
- So where's Jake?
- Sleeping at a friend's.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.191
- He'll get dropped off tomorrow.
- Oh, man.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.749
- I rented a movie he'd like.
- Oh, what'd you get?

00:47.920 --> 00:49.911
Don't worry. It's educational.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.873
<i>One Million Years B. C.?</i>
How is this educational?

00:53.240 --> 00:57.153
Raquel Welch running from dinosaurs
in a fur bikini?

00:57.680 --> 00:59.750
What is that if not history?

01:00.480 --> 01:03.313
I'm afraid you're gonna have to
watch it by yourself.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.391
Won't be the first time.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.758
What's the deal with that giraffe?

01:08.920 --> 01:11.912
How come you bring it out every time
you write an alimony check?

01:12.240 --> 01:13.878
It's symbolic.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.157
Do you wanna know
what it's symbolic of?

01:17.320 --> 01:19.038
No, I'm good.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.637
I made it in ceramics class for Judith
when we were dating.

01:25.440 --> 01:29.479
All these years I've been shelling out
for tennis bracelets and satin underwear.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.600
Some women aren't impressed
with jewelry and lingerie.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.270
Well, sure, if you wanna
date a dead girl.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.637
Hey, I just realized.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.759
Your name is Al, and you're sending
your ex-wife money...

01:43.920 --> 01:48.277
...so it's "Al-i-money."

01:49.920 --> 01:53.674
Hey, hey, I just realized,
your name is Charlie...

01:53.840 --> 01:55.717
...and you're a moron.

02:00.240 --> 02:02.276
Be that as it may.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.675
If you gave her the giraffe,
why do you have it?

02:05.040 --> 02:07.554
When Judith kicked me out,
I wanted to get back at her.

02:07.720 --> 02:10.314
She took the house, she took the car,
she took the money.

02:10.479 --> 02:14.473
- I felt I had to take something.
- So you stole bric-a-brac.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.917
- Symbolic bric-a-brac.
- Oh, right.

02:19.440 --> 02:22.079
You see, now every month
when I write the check...

02:22.240 --> 02:25.596
...I can look at it and remind myself...

02:26.000 --> 02:29.037
...what a pathetic loser I am.

02:31.640 --> 02:34.518
No, dude. You don't need
a giraffe for that.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.393
Get rid of the damn thing.

02:37.560 --> 02:39.596
You're killing yourself
with this bitterness.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.878
What, you think I'm hurting myself
more than her?

02:43.080 --> 02:45.435
No, I don't think
you're hurting her at all.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.872
You need to move on, buddy.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.679
You're right. You're right.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.513
And you know what would
be truly symbolic of that?

02:55.680 --> 02:59.275
Getting your knob shined
by a keno waitress in Laughlin?

03:00.280 --> 03:02.794
No. No.

03:03.720 --> 03:08.191
Me bringing this back to Judith
and apologizing for taking it.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.590
I like my idea better.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.837
Okay, here's the plan.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.072
I'll bring this little fella back to Judith,
and clean the slate.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.477
Did you even consider my idea?

03:21.400 --> 03:23.277
- You drive.
- Why do I have to go?

03:23.440 --> 03:26.352
Because I am obviously
too drunk to drive.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.274
What does that say about your plan?

03:31.000 --> 03:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:38.640 --> 03:39.914
Alan, wait.

03:40.080 --> 03:42.594
You can't stop me.
I am giving Judith back the giraffe.

03:42.760 --> 03:45.513
Oh, I don't wanna stop you.
I just want a good view.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.710
Okay, you can stay.

03:50.120 --> 03:53.749
Charlie, look at this. What is this?
"The Harpers."

03:54.360 --> 03:56.749
- Yeah, so?
- She's not the Harpers anymore.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.956
She's the Harper.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.193
That mat is a complete lie.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.120
Yeah, and it's in cahoots
with the mailbox.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.150
Come on, ring the bell.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.352
You and me, we're the Harpers.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.598
Us.

04:19.640 --> 04:22.074
Oh, Alan.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.959
Hi.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.073
Dr. Melnick. Is Jake all right?

04:29.520 --> 04:32.671
I assume so.
He's spending the night at a friend's.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.632
Oh, that's right, that's right.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.873
Dr. Melnick is Jake's pediatrician,
so naturally, I thought...

04:44.280 --> 04:45.918
Oh, okay.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.914
Looks like somebody else
has given your wife the giraffe.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.158
Make sure they didn't forget
the garlic balls.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.518
What are you doing here?

05:00.680 --> 05:04.229
Why don't I just get back in the hot tub
and give you guys a minute.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.433
- Well?
- I came to give you this.

05:08.880 --> 05:12.509
- What is it?
- I made it for you.

05:12.960 --> 05:17.272
- Just now?
- No, no, a long time ago.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.070
It's symbolic.

05:23.840 --> 05:27.071
Alan, you're a disturbed man.
You need help.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.597
Enjoy those garlic balls.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.554
Wow, that was more fun
than I expected.

05:33.920 --> 05:37.196
- Come on, giraffe boy, I'll buy you a drink.
- Okay.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.430
Wait, wait, wait.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.310
Our pediatrician.

05:54.480 --> 06:01.079
My ex-wife is sleeping
with our pediatrician.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.915
I wonder if she gets a lollipop
after every visit.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.510
You know, you're actually
a very lucky man.

06:16.680 --> 06:20.036
Oh, really? Really? How am I lucky,
Charlie? Show me the luck.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.589
Well, first of all,
if Jake ever gets sick or hurt...

06:22.760 --> 06:24.876
...free medical care is only
a hot tub away.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.713
Well, that's true.
He is good with kids.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.916
I begged her to do it
with me in the hot tub.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.548
She said it made her hair frizzy.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.278
Well, apparently, she's found
the right conditioner.

06:37.640 --> 06:40.757
What if she's serious about this guy?
What if she marries him?

06:41.080 --> 06:43.640
- Even better.
- Better?

06:43.800 --> 06:45.836
How is it better? Show me the better.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.508
If she marries him,
you're off the hook for alimony.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.437
That is better.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.395
In fact, if you saw the big picture,
you'd encourage this relationship.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.632
This guy is a real catch for you.
Don't let him get away.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.719
You're right.
Maybe I should go back there...

07:02.880 --> 07:06.839
...and, you know, bless their union.
- No, no, no.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.072
You provided the woman
and the hot tub.

07:09.240 --> 07:13.313
- That's enough for one night.
- Yeah, I guess.

07:18.280 --> 07:21.795
- Probably even paid for the garlic balls.
- Yeah.

07:47.880 --> 07:50.713
- Could I get some more coffee, Berta?
- Who's stopping you?

08:02.840 --> 08:04.273
Get your own damn coffee.

08:07.800 --> 08:11.190
- Well, Charlie, you're finally up.
- Hey, Mom.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.436
- Where's my grandson?
- He's at a sleepover.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.591
- He'll be here later.
- And no one calls me?

08:16.760 --> 08:19.194
I wouldn't come over if I'd been told
he wasn't here.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.357
Good to know.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.909
Where's your brother?
His car's not in the driveway.

08:24.120 --> 08:28.033
Hey, Mom, I'm not even sure
where my pants are.

08:28.360 --> 08:32.956
All right. Well, looks like you and I get to
spend a little quality time together.

08:33.600 --> 08:37.751
Gee, I'd love to, but I got my regular
Sunday morning softball game.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.234
- Charlie.
- Yeah.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.197
It's Saturday.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.517
Damn.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.916
- Oh, you're still here.
- Yeah.

09:04.080 --> 09:07.914
- Listen, Alan, I'm really sorry about...
- No, no, no. I should apologize to you.

09:08.080 --> 09:11.197
Showing up last night unannounced.
That's completely inappropriate.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.828
And I came by to tell you
it won't happen again.

09:16.560 --> 09:20.473
So you came over unannounced to
apologize for coming over unannounced?

09:21.160 --> 09:22.798
I was afraid you'd pick up on that.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.236
- Is Judith up yet?
- Actually, she's not here.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.391
She ran to the market.

09:28.600 --> 09:32.832
Up and out this early on a Saturday?
Good for her.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.116
She used to sleep a lot
when we were together.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.033
It was probably just the depression
and the meds.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.910
- Meds?
- Oh, no, it was nothing serious.

09:42.080 --> 09:46.232
Just your everyday little pink pill
to turn that frown upside down.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.635
Alan, I gotta tell you,
this is a little awkward...

09:49.800 --> 09:51.279
No, please, don't feel awkward.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.591
Look, we're obviously going
to be seeing each other a lot.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.194
There's no reason for anybody
to feel uncomfortable.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.151
That's a very mature attitude.
Thank you.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.634
Well, you're welcome.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.030
So let me make you some coffee.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.393
Are we supposed to believe...

10:13.560 --> 10:17.678
...that cavewomen waxed their legs
and wore fur bikinis?

10:17.880 --> 10:19.916
It's not a documentary, Mom.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.033
You know, I'm not gonna
be around forever...

10:27.200 --> 10:30.875
...and the time will come
when you'll regret ignoring me.

10:34.320 --> 10:39.474
- Charlie, why do you hate me?
- What?

10:39.640 --> 10:43.519
Whenever I come, you do everything
you can to avoid spending time with me.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.432
Obviously not everything.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.312
We're spending time together
right now.

10:50.480 --> 10:54.075
You're just staring at the television,
and it's not even on anymore.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.514
I can still see you.

10:58.840 --> 11:01.400
Charlie, look at me.

11:10.680 --> 11:14.389
- How long you wanna do this for?
- I want you to talk to me.

11:14.840 --> 11:19.152
- Okay, I'm out of here.
- No, no, wait, Berta.

11:19.320 --> 11:22.995
- Come, sit, talk.
- Mommy-and-me time over already?

11:23.600 --> 11:26.034
- He hates me.
- No, I don't.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.158
- Please, Berta, I need you.
- I'm done. I wanna go home.

11:29.320 --> 11:34.678
- Berta, I'm begging you.
- Oh, all right.

11:42.680 --> 11:45.148
So why do you hate your mother?

11:48.760 --> 11:50.830
Here we go.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.554
Coffee, juice, and my secret stash
of Mint Milanos...

11:54.720 --> 11:56.551
...from the back of the freezer.

11:56.720 --> 12:00.190
Just a tip: If you want quality cookies
around here, you gotta hide them.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.158
Judith eats Pepperidge Farm
like she's going to the chair.

12:03.320 --> 12:07.393
So tell me a little bit about yourself.
Ever been married?

12:08.080 --> 12:12.517
- My wife passed away.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.317
No alimony, though. Gotta love that.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.837
Hey, hey, here's a funny thing.

12:29.440 --> 12:33.911
My name's Al and...
And I give Judith money.

12:34.080 --> 12:37.072
So it's... So it's alimony.

12:38.400 --> 12:43.155
- Wouldn't it be "Al-i-money"?
- I was afraid you'd pick up on that.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.389
- You got kids?
- No.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.313
Well, that's a blessing.
What with the dead wife and all.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.278
- Mint Milanos?
- No, thank you.

13:00.200 --> 13:03.237
So anyway, kids. Hey, you know,
it's not too late for you.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.992
Judith is a wonderful mother.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.670
We're not at that stage
in our relationship.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.831
Oh, of course not.

13:10.200 --> 13:14.432
On the other hand, you don't wanna
wait too long. She's no spring chicken.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.117
You know, eggwise.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.997
So I'm having this nice Mother's Day
dinner with my slutty daughter...

13:25.160 --> 13:26.798
...and her idiot boyfriend.

13:26.960 --> 13:30.589
Suddenly, the front door comes down
and the room fills with tear gas.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.911
Next thing I know, I'm belly-up
on the floor, hacking out a lung...

13:34.080 --> 13:37.311
...while the cops are dragging out
Bonnie and Claude in handcuffs.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.873
Come to find out that the money that
I loaned them to open a tanning salon...

13:42.040 --> 13:45.919
...was used to turn my tool shed
into a hydroponic pot farm.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.112
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.999
Your daughter came to visit
on Mother's Day.

13:51.200 --> 13:54.829
Sure, what ungrateful mutt doesn't visit
their mother on Mother's Day?

13:59.200 --> 14:03.034
- One year I forgot. Let it go.
- When's my birthday?

14:04.560 --> 14:07.233
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

14:08.560 --> 14:13.111
- What's that got to do with anything?
- You don't know your mother's birthday?

14:13.880 --> 14:17.031
- Well, not by heart.
- Charlie.

14:17.200 --> 14:22.433
- What? She changes it all the time.
- Just the year, not the day.

14:23.560 --> 14:26.028
Hey, I just realized something.
I can leave.

14:27.480 --> 14:30.677
Fine. But before you go,
just tell me one thing.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.630
- What?
- Why do you hate me?

14:33.840 --> 14:38.516
Oh, Mom, for God's sakes, l... Rose!

14:39.080 --> 14:43.676
No, no, no. Rose, wait.
Rose, come on in.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.474
Look, my mom's here.
You like my mom.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.871
- Oh, sure. Hi, Evelyn.
- Hello, dear.

14:53.640 --> 14:56.393
- Are those my pants?
- Oh, no.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.710
I bought these.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.429
But I think this might be
your wallet and keys.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.270
Evelyn, you get younger
every time I see you.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.989
Oh, aren't you a dear.
And thank you for the birthday card.

15:12.160 --> 15:15.038
- Oh, did you get it on time?
- Yes, I did, and it was lovely.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.679
So sweet of you to remember me.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.196
How could anybody
forget your birthday?

15:25.240 --> 15:29.358
Well, yeah. You know, she does become
a little emotional at times, huh?

15:29.520 --> 15:31.590
I thought she was getting over
your divorce.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.593
No, no. She was over the divorce
while I was still packing.

15:35.560 --> 15:39.951
No, what you're seeing
is low blood sugar.

15:40.120 --> 15:44.432
The trick to that is to always have
some Fun Size Snickers in your pocket.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.989
- It'll perk her right up.
- Really?

15:47.160 --> 15:49.515
Oh, yeah.
Oh, and here's another tip.

15:49.680 --> 15:54.276
When she starts crying for no reason,
and she will...

15:55.000 --> 15:58.913
...never say, "Don't cry."
And try not to touch her.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.389
- Okay.
- Or whistle.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.953
Never, ever whistle.

16:09.120 --> 16:12.999
Okay, maybe I forgot a birthday or two.
Maybe I don't return every single call.

16:13.160 --> 16:15.549
But that doesn't mean I hate her.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.830
Was he breast-fed?

16:20.200 --> 16:24.239
Of course he was.
Not by me personally.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.999
That's interesting.
I see the bras that come through here...

16:29.160 --> 16:31.071
...and he does tend to favor
the big yams.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.710
- I do not.
- Oh, really?

16:35.200 --> 16:39.318
- Raquel Welch.
- Hey, that's a damn fine film.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.315
Come to think of it,
the night we were together...

16:42.480 --> 16:46.473
...he did spend a freakish amount of time
on my boobies.

16:48.080 --> 16:52.710
I mean, foreplay is one thing, but,
golly, it was like making love to a cat.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.509
Rose, for God's sake,
you're talking to my mother.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.877
Sorry. A very giving cat.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.118
He's always had an oral fixation.

17:03.280 --> 17:06.954
When he was little, he used to
suck on other children's thumbs.

17:07.119 --> 17:09.634
And now he's always got a bottle
of booze in his mouth.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.559
My therapist says that's his way
of stuffing his feelings.

17:12.720 --> 17:16.792
- That's what my therapist says.
- Hell, I could've told you that for free.

17:18.880 --> 17:21.189
- Hey, I'm here.
- Hey, it's Jake.

17:21.520 --> 17:25.433
Back from his sleepover.
Look who's here to see you, buddy.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.511
Hi, Grandma.

17:28.040 --> 17:33.239
Hello, sweetheart.
Thank you for the lovely birthday card.

17:33.400 --> 17:37.234
- My mom picked it out.
- Oh, and you love her, don't you?

17:37.400 --> 17:41.279
- Sure.
- Thank you. You can go now.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.833
- Can I go too?
- We're not done with you.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.635
- Where were we?
- We were trying to figure out...

17:47.800 --> 17:50.189
...why Charlie hates you.
- Yeah.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.510
Well, Charlie?

17:53.160 --> 17:55.276
Okay, fine, here it is.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.749
I'm not saying I hate you,
but if I did...

17:57.920 --> 18:01.515
...it might have to do with the fact that
you're a narcissistic bloodsucker...

18:01.680 --> 18:04.194
...who drove my father
into an early grave.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.875
Then married a succession of men who
couldn't care less about Alan and me...

18:08.040 --> 18:09.359
...which was fine with you...

18:09.520 --> 18:11.829
...because you looked at us
like dancing monkeys...

18:12.000 --> 18:14.514
...you could just haul out
whenever it suited you.

18:14.680 --> 18:17.717
And when it didn't, you sent us off
to boarding school or camp...

18:17.880 --> 18:20.269
...or that kibbutz in Israel,
where we got beat up...

18:20.440 --> 18:22.431
...because we weren't even Jewish!

18:24.840 --> 18:28.071
And now, now you show up here
every chance you get...

18:28.240 --> 18:29.673
...to lay a guilt trip on me...

18:29.840 --> 18:34.356
...for not appreciating my cold,
Ionely, loveless childhood.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.232
Well...

18:41.080 --> 18:43.275
...obviously you're not ready
to talk about it.

18:49.680 --> 18:53.434
- Alan, you really don't have to do this.
- Hey, hey, I am a licensed chiropractor.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.309
If Jake had a sore throat, I'm sure you'd
treat him, prescribe something.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.516
But it's nothing,
I think I just slept wrong.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.399
Oh, that's probably because
you're not used to our bed.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.314
So have you...? Have you met
Judith's parents?

19:08.480 --> 19:11.199
- No.
- Oh, they are just gonna love you.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.998
They were devastated by the divorce.

19:13.160 --> 19:16.197
Not to mention some of her
unfortunate choices thereafter.

19:17.280 --> 19:20.431
- Unfortunate choices?
- Oh, you know, that's not important.

19:20.600 --> 19:24.434
What's important is they're just gonna
be relieved to see she's dating a man.

19:27.160 --> 19:30.038
You carry a lot of tension up here.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.512
Alan.

19:41.240 --> 19:44.357
- Didn't you just pay your alimony?
- This is the pediatrician's bill.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.517
- Jake was sick?
- No, no.

19:46.680 --> 19:49.797
The pediatrician had to see
an orthopedist.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.715
You know Mom's birthday
was a couple weeks ago?

19:54.040 --> 19:55.996
Yeah, I sent her some flowers
and a card.

19:56.200 --> 19:59.078
Oh, man. Would it have killed you
to put my name on the card?

19:59.240 --> 20:03.392
I did put your name on it. I wrote,
"Love, your sons, Alan and Charlie."

20:03.760 --> 20:05.239
- Damn.
- What?

20:05.400 --> 20:08.358
She tricked me into thinking I forgot.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.431
