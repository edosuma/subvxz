02:27.159 --> 02:29.024
I beg your pardon.

03:30.655 --> 03:31.815
Good evening.

03:37.629 --> 03:40.120
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mr. Hardwick.

03:45.170 --> 03:48.264
- Has Mr. Jerry Travers come in yet?
- Yes, sir.

03:48.340 --> 03:51.639
He's been waiting for you
the entire evening, sir.

03:52.010 --> 03:54.444
The entire evening? Oh, dear.

03:55.213 --> 03:56.202
Thanks.

03:56.515 --> 03:58.176
Begging your pardon, sir.

03:58.250 --> 04:02.653
But is that the Mr. Travers,
the well-known American gentleman, sir?

04:02.954 --> 04:04.683
It is indeed.

04:04.756 --> 04:08.658
He's come over to star in my show.
It's his first London appearance.

04:08.727 --> 04:10.251
Your show, Mr. Hardwick?

04:10.328 --> 04:11.955
I'm producing it.

04:12.631 --> 04:14.826
But I don't want
any of the members here to know.

04:14.900 --> 04:16.197
I want to surprise them.

04:16.267 --> 04:19.464
I'm sure they'll be surprised,
Mr. Hardwick.

04:35.487 --> 04:38.012
Hello, Jerry. I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

04:50.435 --> 04:53.097
Jerry, there are a lot of things
that I have to discuss.

04:53.171 --> 04:56.004
So I want you to come over
to my hotel now.

05:05.784 --> 05:07.513
What happened?

05:16.628 --> 05:20.257
Jerry, I forgot to tell you.
I want you to stay here for the night.

05:20.332 --> 05:21.321
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

05:21.399 --> 05:22.627
But you must, old man, really.

05:22.701 --> 05:26.398
You see, at the moment, I'm having
a sort of a problem with my valet.

05:26.805 --> 05:29.239
What do you want me to do,
press your pants?

05:29.307 --> 05:31.207
No. You wouldn't know how.

05:31.276 --> 05:33.471
No, you don't understand.
It's my man, Bates.

05:33.545 --> 05:35.672
- We've had a bit of a tiff.
- How terrible.

05:35.747 --> 05:38.580
- You didn't come to blows or anything?
- Nothing like that.

05:38.650 --> 05:42.780
We're not speaking to each other.
We've had rather a clash of taste.

05:43.021 --> 05:45.512
You see, Bates insists that a square tie...

05:45.590 --> 05:49.048
is the only possible tie
that can be worn with evening clothes.

05:49.861 --> 05:53.319
A square tie, imagine.
I prefer the butterfly.

05:53.698 --> 05:56.792
- I think Bates is right.
- Bates is never right.

05:56.868 --> 06:00.235
- Well, then why don't you fire him?
- That's a little difficult.

06:00.305 --> 06:03.638
I'm hoping against hope
that the man will just disappear.

06:03.875 --> 06:06.571
I hate to interfere
in these little family squabbles.

06:06.645 --> 06:08.636
But let's hope he'll approve of me.

06:08.713 --> 06:11.113
There's never any telling with Bates.

06:11.182 --> 06:13.047
There you are.

06:13.318 --> 06:14.649
If you please.

06:18.657 --> 06:20.124
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

06:20.191 --> 06:23.627
Allow us to introduce ourselves, sir.
We are Bates, sir.

06:24.362 --> 06:25.488
Really?

06:26.498 --> 06:30.594
- We are Jerry Travers.
- Welcome to our mÃ©nage.

06:30.702 --> 06:34.001
Thank you, Bates.
It seems that I'm to stay here tonight.

06:34.072 --> 06:37.633
At least that was the idea
of our beloved impresario.

06:37.776 --> 06:39.141
Whose idea?

06:39.244 --> 06:40.575
Mr. Hardwick's.

06:41.379 --> 06:43.176
His idea.

06:46.851 --> 06:49.581
Welcome anyhow.

06:49.788 --> 06:51.449
Thank you, Bates.

06:51.756 --> 06:55.556
Pardon, sir, but may we make
a personal observation?

06:55.894 --> 06:58.419
- Not too personal.
- No, sir.

06:58.763 --> 07:01.698
It's merely that we feel impelled
to compliment you, sir...

07:01.766 --> 07:04.496
upon your excellent taste in ties.

07:12.277 --> 07:15.405
- They like me.
- You never know.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.107
Where on earth did you ever find him?

07:17.182 --> 07:19.343
From the Salvation Army,
as a matter of fact.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.248
I sent them a pair of very old shoes.

07:21.319 --> 07:24.186
I see. And the shoes came back
and Bates was in them.

07:24.255 --> 07:27.247
And he's been wearing
my good ones ever since.

07:27.525 --> 07:30.289
- How's Madge feeling?
- She's fine. Thanks, Jerry.

07:30.362 --> 07:32.592
The climate at the Lido
has done her a lot of good.

07:32.664 --> 07:35.929
That's fine. Too bad she won't be here
for the opening tomorrow night.

07:36.001 --> 07:37.525
Isn't it? She's heartbroken, really.

07:37.602 --> 07:40.730
However, she's expecting us to fly down
to Italy for a weekend.

07:40.805 --> 07:44.901
Fly down to Italy for a weekend?
I can't. I haven't got any goggles.

07:44.976 --> 07:47.638
My word, Jerry, you'll have to go.
She's counting on us.

07:47.712 --> 07:49.646
She's going to have
a young friend visit her.

07:49.714 --> 07:51.477
I suspect there's something in the air.

07:51.549 --> 07:54.279
You know Madge
and her matchmaking proclivities.

07:54.352 --> 07:56.377
Is she expecting me
for a weekend or a wedding?

07:57.088 --> 07:59.613
You can't tell. You know how wives are.

08:00.058 --> 08:02.458
No, I don't. How are they?

08:02.794 --> 08:05.854
Wives? They always have a little scheme.

08:05.930 --> 08:08.922
Look here, I think it's about time
you found out for yourself.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.558
- You do?
- I certainly do.

08:10.635 --> 08:11.693
No, thanks, Horace.

08:11.770 --> 08:14.432
In me you see a youth
who's completely on the loose.

08:14.506 --> 08:16.633
No yens, no yearning.

10:48.193 --> 10:49.922
Hello. This is Miss Tremont.

10:49.994 --> 10:52.224
I'd like to speak
to the manager immediately.

11:01.773 --> 11:03.536
Hello. Are you there?

11:03.841 --> 11:07.834
Who? The manager. Yes.
I can't hear a word you're saying.

11:07.912 --> 11:09.971
There's a young lady downstairs.

11:10.148 --> 11:12.981
A young lady. At this time of night?

11:13.084 --> 11:17.248
She can't come up here now.
No, I'd better come down myself.

11:17.922 --> 11:19.355
Jerry, go right ahead.

11:19.424 --> 11:22.484
A young lady downstairs
evidently wants to see me.

12:13.911 --> 12:14.900
Hello.

12:19.284 --> 12:21.445
Won't you come in?

12:22.220 --> 12:23.983
I'm awfully glad you dropped in.

12:24.055 --> 12:28.151
I dropped up from the room below,
where I've been trying to get some sleep.

12:28.459 --> 12:32.623
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize I was disturbing you.

12:33.164 --> 12:36.327
You see, every once in a while,
I suddenly find myself...

12:37.035 --> 12:38.263
dancing.

12:38.770 --> 12:40.965
I suppose it's some kind of an affliction?

12:41.039 --> 12:43.371
Yes, it's an affliction.

12:44.342 --> 12:45.934
St. Vitus' dance.

12:46.044 --> 12:48.205
And it only occurs at this time of night?

12:48.279 --> 12:51.680
Yes, that's it.
It only occurs at this time of night.

12:52.917 --> 12:56.353
As a matter of fact,
I really shouldn't be left alone.

12:56.521 --> 12:57.715
Yes, I can see that.

12:57.789 --> 13:00.553
You probably should have
a couple of guards.

13:02.193 --> 13:04.457
I think you're very unkind
to make fun of me.

13:04.529 --> 13:05.860
I'm sorry.

13:08.533 --> 13:11.058
- I wish you wouldn't leave.
- Why not?

13:11.869 --> 13:14.360
I think I feel an attack coming on.

13:16.307 --> 13:18.172
See, there it is.

13:20.778 --> 13:22.268
So I see.

13:22.413 --> 13:24.779
There's only one thing that'll stop me.

13:25.049 --> 13:27.176
You must tell me what it is.

13:27.318 --> 13:30.116
My nurses always
put their arms around me.

13:33.191 --> 13:37.457
I'll call the house detective
and tell him to put his arms around you.

13:43.668 --> 13:45.067
Good night.

14:11.496 --> 14:14.124
What are you doing here?
What are you carrying that for?

14:14.198 --> 14:15.995
- Who was the young lady?
- What young lady?

14:16.067 --> 14:18.297
That call wasn't for me. It was for you.

14:18.369 --> 14:19.961
Somebody has registered a complaint.

14:20.037 --> 14:22.403
I know. I've just seen the complaint.

14:22.473 --> 14:26.204
She's lovely, she's delightful,
she's charming, and she wants to sleep.

14:26.277 --> 14:27.437
She does?

14:27.678 --> 14:31.478
And I'm going to help her,
and you're going to help me. Take this.

14:31.916 --> 14:34.384
No, bring it in here
and guard it with your life.

14:34.452 --> 14:35.817
- What are you going to do?
- Never mind.

14:47.965 --> 14:49.830
Look here, what's the idea?

14:49.901 --> 14:51.664
The young lady downstairs wants to sleep.

14:51.736 --> 14:52.828
So you told me.

14:52.904 --> 14:55.668
I've appointed myself her official sandman.

14:56.707 --> 14:57.901
But, Jerry...

16:20.892 --> 16:22.325
What else have you got?

16:22.393 --> 16:25.089
I'm sorry, sir,
but you've cleaned out the shop.

16:25.263 --> 16:28.699
You better tell them
to plant some more for tomorrow.

16:29.233 --> 16:31.793
They are all to go
to Miss Dale Tremont, sir?

16:31.903 --> 16:33.131
That's right.

16:35.506 --> 16:37.167
Her room number is 304.

16:43.514 --> 16:44.674
What's that?

16:44.782 --> 16:47.615
That's for the opening
of a butcher shop, sir.

16:48.786 --> 16:51.755
- Send that up, too.
- But, sir, a horseshoe?

16:51.989 --> 16:55.447
Why, yes, I may want to order
a peach orchard tomorrow.

16:56.394 --> 16:58.954
What's the number of your room, sir?

17:00.765 --> 17:03.359
Just charge it to Horace Hardwick,
room 404.

17:03.467 --> 17:04.455
Yes, sir.

17:08.239 --> 17:10.707
I wonder what Mr. Beddini
is going to say about this.

17:10.775 --> 17:12.367
What can he say?

17:12.542 --> 17:16.343
He's been sending her flowers daily
ever since they came here.

17:18.415 --> 17:20.111
And entre nous...

17:20.318 --> 17:22.377
the desk clerk has intimated...

17:22.553 --> 17:26.454
that Mr. Beddini provides Miss Tremont
with all the niceties...

17:26.891 --> 17:28.449
including her clothes.

17:28.526 --> 17:29.515
Really?

17:30.227 --> 17:32.593
And her niceties are very nice.

17:39.003 --> 17:40.595
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

17:40.671 --> 17:45.040
- I do hope you slept well last night.
- I slept well enough, but not long enough.

17:45.109 --> 17:46.599
I'm sorry. I was hoping...

17:46.677 --> 17:48.907
there was something I could do
to square myself.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.277
That's quite all right.

17:50.348 --> 17:52.873
I thought perhaps I could drive you
to the stables.

17:52.950 --> 17:56.215
No, thank you. I have a hansom cab
waiting for me outside.

17:56.287 --> 17:58.187
With a horse in front of it?

17:58.322 --> 18:01.052
Yes. You see,
the stable people always use them.

18:01.125 --> 18:03.389
They feel the horse is coming back.

18:03.561 --> 18:05.188
Where's he been?

18:12.136 --> 18:14.798
We're leaving tonight.
Has Mr. Beddini made arrangements?

18:14.872 --> 18:15.998
Yes, Miss Tremont.

18:16.073 --> 18:18.439
He's ordered your baggage
to be picked up at 7:00.

18:18.509 --> 18:19.601
Thank you.

18:41.732 --> 18:44.098
- Driver.
- Yes, miss?

18:44.502 --> 18:46.936
Can't you go any faster than this?

18:47.338 --> 18:51.570
Lord love a duck, miss. I can,
but I'm not allowed to leave the horse.

18:54.545 --> 18:57.070
I meant the horse, of course.

18:58.516 --> 19:01.644
It's like this, miss.
You see, the horse is kind of tired today...

19:01.719 --> 19:04.347
on account of having won
the Grand National on Friday.

19:04.422 --> 19:07.414
Are you trying to tell me
that this is a racehorse?

19:07.558 --> 19:10.391
Yes, miss, and I've got his pedigree, too.

19:10.561 --> 19:13.462
As a matter of fact,
his sire was Man O'War.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.624
Who was his dam?

19:17.768 --> 19:21.033
- I beg your pardon, miss?
- I said, who was his dam?

19:21.772 --> 19:24.502
I don't know, miss. He didn't give a...

19:46.397 --> 19:47.523
Peekaboo.

19:47.598 --> 19:49.395
Stop this cab at once.

19:49.867 --> 19:51.061
I don't know how.

19:51.135 --> 19:54.400
I've never handled anything
more complicated than a Duesenberg.

19:54.472 --> 19:55.962
Take it easy, Mavis.

19:56.140 --> 19:58.233
What are we going to do?

19:58.943 --> 20:03.141
In dealing with a girl or horse,
one just lets nature take its course.

20:25.736 --> 20:27.397
There we are, miss.

20:28.506 --> 20:31.407
I told you the horse
would bring you to the right place.

20:31.475 --> 20:34.774
What is this strange power
you have over horses?

20:35.312 --> 20:36.711
Horsepower.

20:38.516 --> 20:40.643
Don't I even get any thanks?

20:44.955 --> 20:46.855
Buy yourself a new hat.

21:39.677 --> 21:40.939
Cab, miss?

22:05.202 --> 22:06.897
May I rescue you?

22:08.172 --> 22:11.005
No, thank you, I prefer being in distress.

22:18.148 --> 22:20.309
Charming little spot you have here.

22:20.384 --> 22:22.511
When does the concert start?

22:23.687 --> 22:26.281
Just as soon as you and the rain stop.

22:27.591 --> 22:29.024
Now, please.

22:29.526 --> 22:33.724
You wouldn't like to be
just a little bit more friendly, would you?

22:34.465 --> 22:37.957
Why should I?
I don't know you from Adam.

22:39.470 --> 22:41.768
Maybe it's the way I'm dressed.

22:46.810 --> 22:48.869
Are you afraid of thunder?

22:49.213 --> 22:51.807
No, it's just the noise.

22:53.550 --> 22:56.075
You know what thunder is, don't you?

22:56.620 --> 22:57.917
Of course.

23:01.258 --> 23:03.055
It's something about the air.

23:06.163 --> 23:10.395
No, when a clumsy cloud from here
meets a fluffy little cloud from there...

23:11.635 --> 23:13.762
he billows towards her...

23:13.837 --> 23:17.136
she scurries away
and he scuds right up to her.

23:18.075 --> 23:19.337
She cries a little...

23:19.910 --> 23:21.901
and there you have your shower.

23:22.646 --> 23:23.977
He comforts her.

23:24.214 --> 23:25.511
They spark.

23:26.016 --> 23:27.881
That's the lightning.

23:28.786 --> 23:30.515
They kiss.

23:31.255 --> 23:32.244
Thunder.

27:59.044 --> 28:01.410
Who is sending you this horse's shoe?

28:01.713 --> 28:02.907
How cute.

28:02.981 --> 28:05.973
Alberto, I've seen him.
I've talked to him. I've danced with him.

28:06.051 --> 28:08.110
- Him? Who is this him?
- Who?

28:08.353 --> 28:10.651
His name is Adam.

28:10.789 --> 28:12.188
You forget this Adam.

28:12.257 --> 28:14.225
You have promised to go with me to Italy.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.818
Your friend Madge Hardwick
is awaiting you.

28:17.062 --> 28:21.431
There, you will dazzle the eyes
in clothes designed by Alberto Beddini.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.367
Alberto, I hope you don't mind,
but I'm not going to the Lido.

28:24.436 --> 28:26.267
<i>Madre mia. What you say?</i>

28:26.338 --> 28:28.533
My dear, listen to me.
We have made agreement.

28:28.607 --> 28:30.131
Beddini designs the clothes...

28:30.208 --> 28:32.506
which you wear among your friends,
the smart people.

28:32.577 --> 28:33.601
So that they ask:

28:33.679 --> 28:36.409
"Who is so smart
as to make these smart clothes?"

28:36.481 --> 28:40.008
And you say,
"Who? Who is so smart? Beddini. "

28:40.419 --> 28:43.320
Forget this Adam. Beddini demands it.

28:44.222 --> 28:45.917
Beddini does, does he?

28:46.224 --> 28:49.887
Alberto, up to the present, our relationship
has been purely a business one.

28:49.961 --> 28:52.395
But if you start interfering
in my personal affairs...

28:52.464 --> 28:55.262
I'll go back to America
and live on the dole.

28:55.500 --> 28:59.596
Now, Dale darling, I'm so sorry.
I did not mean to interfere.

28:59.905 --> 29:02.738
Go ahead, fall in love with this Adam.
Marry him.

29:02.841 --> 29:05.708
But, as Mrs. Adam, what would you wear?

29:06.445 --> 29:07.742
Fig leaves.

29:16.688 --> 29:18.019
Thank you, sir.

29:19.157 --> 29:21.057
Dale, a telegram for you.

29:21.827 --> 29:23.795
Read it to me, please.

29:25.030 --> 29:26.395
"Come ahead, stop.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.294
"Stop being a sap, stop.

29:28.700 --> 29:31.396
"You can even bring Alberto, stop.

29:32.270 --> 29:35.034
"My husband is stopping
at your hotel, stop.

29:35.340 --> 29:37.240
"When do you start, stop. "

29:38.577 --> 29:40.841
I cannot understand. Who wrote this?

29:41.012 --> 29:43.071
Sounds like Gertrude Stein.

29:43.715 --> 29:45.808
No, it's from Madge Hardwick.

29:46.151 --> 29:49.882
She says her husband is stopping
at this hotel and will look you up.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.651
Wonder what kind of man Madge married.

29:53.725 --> 29:56.751
He's sure to have influence.
Let's be nice to him.

29:56.828 --> 29:59.388
I'm going to be too busy
being nice to somebody else.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.295
Dale, you can't do this.

30:01.566 --> 30:04.626
All my life I have promised my dresses
to take them to Italy...

30:04.703 --> 30:06.102
and you must be in them.

30:06.171 --> 30:08.435
Sorry, Alberto, but I'm unpacking.

30:13.578 --> 30:16.706
Never again will I allow
women to wear my dresses.

30:31.196 --> 30:33.187
- Good evening, Miss Tremont.
- Good evening.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.028
Mr. Beddini and I have decided to stay.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.728
I'm so glad. Then I'll cancel the order
about the bags.

30:37.803 --> 30:41.136
Thank you. Is there a Mr. Hardwick
stopping at this hotel?

30:41.239 --> 30:45.107
Why, yes, Miss Tremont.
Mr. Hardwick has room 404.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.735
Just above you.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.905
- Are you sure?
- Definitely, miss.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.647
As a matter of fact,
there's Mr. Hardwick now...

30:55.720 --> 30:56.744
on the mezzanine.

30:56.822 --> 30:59.120
The gentleman
with the briefcase and cane.

31:10.569 --> 31:12.560
- Horace, here's a telegram for you.
- For me?

31:12.637 --> 31:15.231
- It's from Italy.
- Italy? That's probably from Madge.

31:15.307 --> 31:17.741
There's a message in your room
to call the box office.

31:17.809 --> 31:19.709
Some trouble about the tickets
or something.

31:19.778 --> 31:21.245
Trouble? With the tickets?

31:21.313 --> 31:23.178
My word, Jerry. Why, they wouldn't dare.

31:23.248 --> 31:27.275
Will you hold those things for me please?
Get a taxi and I'll meet you downstairs.

31:27.352 --> 31:28.341
All right.

31:44.469 --> 31:45.561
Cab, miss?

31:46.638 --> 31:49.971
When a clumsy cloud meets
a fluffy little cloud.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.317
We're only trying
to investigate matters, miss.

32:01.386 --> 32:03.411
We must protect our guests.

32:03.588 --> 32:07.820
She does not need your protection.
I am too much protection enough.

32:08.527 --> 32:12.486
There's nothing to investigate.
Nothing matters, nothing's happened.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.964
Will you please ask
these gentlemen to go?

32:15.033 --> 32:17.524
You mean to tell me
that girl slapped your face...

32:17.602 --> 32:19.570
in front of all those people for nothing?

32:19.638 --> 32:21.606
What would you have done, sold tickets?

32:21.673 --> 32:24.164
I mean, you did nothing,
and yet she slapped your face?

32:24.242 --> 32:27.575
- Now you're getting it.
- I wish you'd be serious about this.

32:27.646 --> 32:30.410
One breath of scandal at this time
will ruin our show.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.973
Why, I'd rather have had it happen
to me than to you.

32:33.051 --> 32:35.747
- Lf you enjoy that sort of thing.
- I do, immensely.

32:35.820 --> 32:36.878
Don't be absurd.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.924
I hate men. I hate you. I hate all men!

32:41.059 --> 32:43.619
<i>But cara mia, you make a big mistake.</i>

32:43.695 --> 32:44.957
I am no man.

32:45.096 --> 32:47.030
I am Beddini.

32:48.667 --> 32:51.932
How could he have made love to me
when he was married all the time?

32:52.003 --> 32:54.995
And to Madge of all people.

32:55.073 --> 32:57.633
So, this snake in the grass, this Adam...

32:57.709 --> 32:59.700
already he has eaten the apple?

32:59.778 --> 33:00.767
Yes.

33:04.149 --> 33:06.140
I will kill him for you.

33:07.052 --> 33:08.781
Have you finished packing?

33:09.321 --> 33:11.551
But you do not understand.

33:25.937 --> 33:27.928
Are we leaving or aren't we?

33:28.006 --> 33:31.533
No, you cannot go back to America.
We must go to the Lido.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.237
But I can't face his wife.

33:33.311 --> 33:37.042
And why not?
Women are facing wives every day.

33:37.315 --> 33:40.751
And, after all, you can't avoid seeing
Madge sometime, can you?

33:41.052 --> 33:42.110
I guess not.

33:42.187 --> 33:45.179
Very well then.
Why not face the musicians now?

33:47.325 --> 33:49.520
All right. Maybe she ought to know.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.907
You're sure
you didn't forget yourself in the park?

34:10.982 --> 34:11.971
Positive.

34:12.116 --> 34:15.347
If I ever forgot myself with that girl,
I'd remember it.

34:20.525 --> 34:23.983
- We're the management.
- Are you?

34:25.263 --> 34:28.164
Oh, dear. Some more
of these plural personalities.

34:30.501 --> 34:31.763
Just a moment.

34:32.536 --> 34:35.734
Jerry, get into my bedroom, quick.
No one must know you're here.

34:35.806 --> 34:40.176
If they ever suspect that you're in this,
it'll be in every newspaper in an hour.

34:42.179 --> 34:45.706
Well, gentlemen,
this is a pleasant surprise.

34:45.783 --> 34:49.219
A small matter of great import
has come to our attention, sir.

34:49.520 --> 34:53.081
I am up here in your interest
and to protect the hotel.

34:53.157 --> 34:56.251
- We wish to avoid any scandal.
- Scandal?

34:56.327 --> 34:58.955
Yes, in connection
with a certain slap in the face.

34:59.030 --> 35:02.261
The young lady refuses to divulge
why she slapped you.

35:02.467 --> 35:04.765
Well, she didn't slap my face.

35:06.971 --> 35:08.438
Who did she slap?

35:08.506 --> 35:10.269
Why, it was... Who?

35:11.609 --> 35:13.634
It was he, my valet.

35:13.978 --> 35:15.309
Me, sir?

35:16.614 --> 35:20.015
Why, of course. Don't argue with me.
How did it happen?

35:22.487 --> 35:26.514
Possibly we had been
a little imprudent, sir.

35:27.225 --> 35:29.625
Of course. You see,
we had been a little imprudent.

35:29.694 --> 35:31.958
But you said it wasn't you.

35:32.030 --> 35:34.794
Not Mr. Hardwick.

35:34.933 --> 35:38.460
Gentlemen, we take all the blame myself.

35:39.771 --> 35:41.830
And there we are. There you are.

35:41.906 --> 35:45.865
You see, it was just a mistake.
I'll take him to task personally.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.103
- Thank you, sir.
- Not at all.

35:47.178 --> 35:48.702
- Good night.
- Not at all.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.475
- Good night.
- Good night.

35:54.118 --> 35:56.279
Bates, thank you.

35:57.188 --> 35:59.986
You know, really,
you are an invaluable assistant.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.317
Thank you, sir. Allow us, sir.

36:04.028 --> 36:05.461
Thank you, Bates.

36:05.863 --> 36:07.956
- Your coat, sir.
- Really?

36:09.133 --> 36:12.933
This is like old times, isn't it?
Your helping me with my coat, I mean.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.302
It's a pleasure we have missed, sir.

36:15.373 --> 36:17.807
- Thank you, Bates.
- Thank you, sir.

36:18.676 --> 36:21.270
How is our lumbago this evening, sir?

36:21.379 --> 36:25.247
- It's so much better, Bates, thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

36:26.417 --> 36:27.850
- Bates.
- Yes, sir?

36:31.155 --> 36:34.283
There's a crisis afoot.
Couldn't we bury the hatchet?

36:34.459 --> 36:37.257
I mean, couldn't we forget
all about the ties?

36:38.563 --> 36:41.657
<i>Sic transit gloria mundi, sir.</i>

36:42.500 --> 36:44.058
- Bates.
- Yes, sir.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.567
Mr. Travers is in trouble.

36:46.637 --> 36:49.970
He's practically put his foot
right into a hornet's nest.

36:50.875 --> 36:53.776
But, hornets' nests grow on trees, sir.

36:54.412 --> 36:57.245
Never mind that.
We have got to do something.

36:57.315 --> 37:00.011
What about rubbing it with butter, sir?

37:00.585 --> 37:03.748
You blasted fool,
you can't rub a girl with butter!

37:03.821 --> 37:07.780
My sister got into a hornets' nest
and we rubbed her with butter, sir.

37:07.859 --> 37:10.293
That's the wrong treatment.
You should have used mud.

37:10.361 --> 37:11.726
Never mind that!

37:11.996 --> 37:13.691
Mr. Travers is in trouble.

37:13.765 --> 37:17.531
It is liable to develop into a scandal
that will involve all of us.

37:17.835 --> 37:20.099
There's a young lady in the room below us.

37:20.171 --> 37:21.638
I've seen her, sir.

37:21.873 --> 37:24.205
I want you to find out
all you can about her.

37:24.275 --> 37:27.574
Follow her wherever she goes.
Never take your eyes off her.

37:27.645 --> 37:29.135
- Never, sir?
- Never.

37:29.213 --> 37:32.740
- Whither she goes...
- Thither I, sir.

37:33.751 --> 37:37.812
Right you are, sir. Whither or thither.

37:44.896 --> 37:47.296
- What happened?
- It's all right. I fixed it.

37:47.365 --> 37:50.823
But things are getting involved.
This is a deep-laid plot.

37:50.902 --> 37:53.302
Nonsense. Why should this girl want
to involve me?

37:53.371 --> 37:56.568
Why, for money, of course. Publicity.
Anything to create a scandal.

37:56.641 --> 37:58.370
I'm going to see her and buy her off.

37:58.443 --> 38:01.776
You're not. If anyone's going to buy
her anything, I am going to do it.

38:01.846 --> 38:05.247
No, you stay right here.
I'll clear this all up myself.

38:05.316 --> 38:07.181
It's probably some little thing you did...

38:07.251 --> 38:10.618
carried away for the moment,
that offended her sense of decorum.

38:10.688 --> 38:14.818
If I did, I'm going right down
and do it again. Goodbye, old boy.

38:22.733 --> 38:24.257
<i>Come along, cara mia.</i>

38:30.074 --> 38:32.440
- Get me a taxi, quickly.
- Taxi.

38:34.645 --> 38:35.771
Follow that cab.

38:37.482 --> 38:38.471
Come in.

38:43.087 --> 38:45.112
Where's the young lady
that has this room?

38:45.189 --> 38:46.383
She's gone, sir.

38:46.457 --> 38:47.822
- Gone?
- Yes, sir.

38:50.261 --> 38:52.252
You don't mind if I get on with me work?

38:52.330 --> 38:55.322
I gotta get these flowers out
in the morning's rubbish.

38:55.399 --> 38:57.993
That's all right, go ahead. Go right ahead.

39:13.417 --> 39:17.012
Jerry, do you realize that we have
less than an hour before the show opens?

39:17.088 --> 39:19.682
We've got to get out of here. Come on.

39:43.614 --> 39:46.310
Women do strange things sometimes,
don't they, George?

39:46.384 --> 39:47.646
Yes, sir.

39:49.787 --> 39:52.551
- That first act was simply marvelous.
- Good.

39:52.623 --> 39:54.887
Everybody's crazy about it.
The critics are raving.

39:54.959 --> 39:56.426
I've got some more good news.

39:56.494 --> 39:59.224
- Did you find out were she's gone?
- She? Oh, that girl.

39:59.297 --> 40:02.858
No, but, Jerry, please.
The entire Thackeray Club is out in front.

40:02.934 --> 40:05.732
You don't suppose
my dancing has disturbed them?

40:05.803 --> 40:09.637
I don't think so. They didn't say.
Of course not. It's perfectly all right here.

40:09.707 --> 40:11.004
Second act begins, Mr. Travers.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.167
Thanks. I'll be there.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.768
Really, the second act.
A lot of telegrams for you.

40:14.845 --> 40:16.938
I'll be right back 
as soon as the act is over.

40:17.014 --> 40:19.482
My word, I never read
my own telegram from Madge.

40:19.550 --> 40:21.279
Isn't it too bad she isn't here tonight?

40:21.352 --> 40:23.411
The biggest night of my life
and she isn't here.

40:23.487 --> 40:26.320
- What does she say?
- All kinds of good wishes for our success.

40:26.390 --> 40:29.985
Sorry we can't fly down to Italy after
the performance to meet her friend.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.461
Her little friend is in London,
staying at my hotel.

40:32.530 --> 40:33.622
Her name is Tremont.

40:33.698 --> 40:36.189
Tremont? Wait a minute. Let me see that.

40:36.567 --> 40:39.968
Horace, hire a plane right away.
We're leaving for Italy in the morning.

40:40.037 --> 40:41.299
One minute, Mr. Travers.

40:41.372 --> 40:44.432
You can't do that. The seats were sold out
for months in advance.

40:44.508 --> 40:45.998
How long does it take to fly there?

40:46.077 --> 40:48.671
Seven hours. You have to be back
Monday for a performance.

40:48.746 --> 40:51.214
Charter a plane for the weekend,
we'll be back in time.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.271
You're on, Mr. Travers.

40:52.350 --> 40:53.840
I will not jeopardize my position.

40:53.918 --> 40:56.751
If you want this show to run two nights,
get me a plane now.

40:56.821 --> 40:59.847
- What kind of a plane?
- One with wings.

46:25.416 --> 46:28.385
I'll go look for Madge
and see you later for cocktails.

46:53.277 --> 46:56.371
- Dale, when did you get down?
- Just now.

46:56.447 --> 46:58.540
Good. Have something to drink.

47:04.922 --> 47:06.219
Horse's neck.

47:09.259 --> 47:11.989
- It's grand seeing you.
- And it's grand seeing you.

47:12.062 --> 47:14.462
Now tell me, did my husband look you up?

47:15.966 --> 47:18.833
- Yes.
- How did he impress you?

47:20.270 --> 47:22.568
I think he is very fascinating.

47:23.240 --> 47:24.400
Fascinating?

47:24.575 --> 47:29.035
You know, every once in a while, the effect
Horace has on people surprises me.

47:29.747 --> 47:31.578
He sort of surprised me, too.

47:32.016 --> 47:35.213
I'm glad you liked him.
He will be here today.

47:36.053 --> 47:37.748
No. He can't...

47:39.590 --> 47:42.058
What's the matter? Did he flirt with you?

47:43.627 --> 47:45.857
He sent me a room full of flowers.

47:46.497 --> 47:48.556
That was sweet of him.

47:50.467 --> 47:52.867
But, Madge, you don't understand, he...

47:54.238 --> 47:57.503
- He chased me in the park.
- Really?

47:57.574 --> 48:00.600
I didn't know
Horace was capable of that much activity.

48:00.678 --> 48:02.043
Did he catch you?

48:03.981 --> 48:06.779
- Yes.
- Good for Horace.

48:08.552 --> 48:10.179
Why, Madge, you shock me.

48:10.254 --> 48:12.722
Horace flirts with
every attractive girl he meets.

48:12.790 --> 48:14.519
He doesn't mean anything.

48:19.063 --> 48:21.258
That's a funny way to take it.

48:21.398 --> 48:25.334
My dear, when you are as old as I am,
you'll take your men as you find them.

48:25.402 --> 48:27.393
If you can find them.

48:40.718 --> 48:41.844
And another thing, Jerry.

48:41.919 --> 48:44.285
The gossip at the hotel
was that this man, Beddini...

48:44.354 --> 48:47.619
was supplying her with everything.
Money, clothes, flowers.

48:47.925 --> 48:50.086
No, Horace, you provided the flowers.

48:50.160 --> 48:53.721
I? I never did anything.
I didn't even know her. Don't be ridiculous.

48:53.797 --> 48:56.425
But anyway, as soon as we land,
I'm going to see Madge...

48:56.500 --> 49:00.231
and I am going to find out from her
just who and what this Tremont person is.

49:00.304 --> 49:02.238
I only want to find out where.

49:02.606 --> 49:04.130
Now, Jerry, I warn you...

49:04.208 --> 49:07.439
you don't realize the trouble
a designing woman can make for a man.

49:07.511 --> 49:11.447
Now, I know all about these things.
I wouldn't tell this to anybody.

49:14.218 --> 49:17.119
I am the victim
of a designing woman myself.

49:17.354 --> 49:19.948
- Surely you don't mean Madge?
- Why, certainly, who else?

49:20.023 --> 49:22.992
Not Madge. She doesn't know
anything about it either.

49:24.128 --> 49:25.425
Her name is Violet.

49:25.496 --> 49:27.794
She is what the French call a passade.

49:28.298 --> 49:32.200
I see. Little ships that pass in the night.

49:32.603 --> 49:35.595
Ships? Yes. Exactly.

49:36.039 --> 49:38.473
I met her at the birdhouse in the zoo.

49:38.575 --> 49:42.511
She was a very pretty little thing
and she seemed to be quite frightened.

49:42.579 --> 49:43.637
Of the birds?

49:43.714 --> 49:46.911
Yes. You see,
she had led a very sheltered life.

49:47.050 --> 49:49.848
It was the storks in particular
that worried her.

49:50.020 --> 49:51.954
I took her to a cinema...

49:52.022 --> 49:54.923
and then we had dinner
and then I took her to another cinema.

49:54.992 --> 49:57.722
Then I fear
I forgot myself and let her kiss me.

50:15.445 --> 50:17.572
That must be his plane now. Come on.

50:19.550 --> 50:21.313
No, I'd rather not.

50:21.418 --> 50:22.510
Come on. If I were you...

50:22.586 --> 50:26.920
I wouldn't miss this opportunity
of seeing the early worm get the bird.

50:33.597 --> 50:38.000
You know, Dale, I haven't told you
the real reason I asked you down here.

50:38.869 --> 50:39.893
Haven't you?

50:39.970 --> 50:44.430
No, I feel I've known you long enough
to have the right to talk to you this way.

50:45.442 --> 50:49.071
In spite of the fact that
all men are males...

50:49.246 --> 50:54.115
there is no feeling so secure as having
a good, reliable husband. I know.

51:14.271 --> 51:16.637
- Jerry.
- Hello, Madge, I'll see you in a minute.

51:21.378 --> 51:23.039
Where did Miss Tremont go?

51:23.180 --> 51:26.013
- Dale didn't tell me she'd met you.
- Yes, we've met.

51:26.083 --> 51:28.745
Fine, I've arranged
a little dinner party for all of us.

51:28.819 --> 51:30.184
Let's eat now.

51:30.254 --> 51:33.246
Leave the child alone,
she's a little upset about something.

51:33.323 --> 51:36.087
- Really?
- Yes. Tell me, how did Dale strike you?

51:37.427 --> 51:40.055
- Right between the eyes.
- Good.

51:40.430 --> 51:43.627
- Where's Horace?
- I left him struggling with the baggage.

51:43.700 --> 51:47.363
The hotel's crowded and both of you
will have to bunk together tonight.

51:47.437 --> 51:48.461
Dale's with me.

51:48.538 --> 51:51.996
<i>- Did you get that room for my husband?
- Si, signora, but I am so sorry...</i>

51:52.075 --> 51:55.374
because of the carnival,
the only thing available is the bridal suite.

51:55.445 --> 51:59.313
- The bridal suite.
- How romantic. Thank you.

52:01.885 --> 52:04.410
<i>Signor, are you Horace Hardwick?</i>

52:04.488 --> 52:06.888
Thank you, I am. How do you do?

52:07.391 --> 52:09.791
- I am very displeased to meet you.
- Really?

52:09.860 --> 52:12.658
What do you mean, displeased?

52:12.896 --> 52:14.227
<i>Signor, I warn you.</i>

52:14.398 --> 52:17.890
For men of your kind,
this is not a healthy place.

52:17.968 --> 52:20.835
My dear fellow, this is one
of the healthiest spots in Europe.

52:20.904 --> 52:22.929
The air, the breeze, the flowers.

52:23.206 --> 52:25.697
So it is funny tricks you're being.

52:25.776 --> 52:27.175
I warn you...

52:27.244 --> 52:31.908
never let your path
criss-cross mine again, or the heart...

52:45.562 --> 52:47.860
- Horace.
- How do you do?

52:48.231 --> 52:50.961
Madge, darling.

52:51.034 --> 52:54.128
My, your passion frightens me.

52:54.538 --> 52:58.099
- Been practicing?
- Yes. Well, scarcely. No.

52:58.809 --> 53:01.277
Madge, what do you think
has happened to me?

53:01.411 --> 53:04.847
- I know. You got your first long trousers.
- Madge, please.

53:04.915 --> 53:07.645
There's something down here
that I have to investigate...

53:07.718 --> 53:10.744
and Jerry thinks that I...
Maybe I better tell it anonymously.

53:10.821 --> 53:14.120
You know, it sounds as if you were
about to confess something, Horace.

53:14.191 --> 53:16.716
Does it? What would I have to confess?

53:16.793 --> 53:19.591
You really want to tell me
about Dale Tremont, don't you?

53:19.663 --> 53:22.097
Yes, but then again, no.

53:22.165 --> 53:24.759
You see, as a matter of fact,
I haven't even met her yet.

53:24.835 --> 53:27.167
- You haven't met her?
- No.

53:27.237 --> 53:29.797
If that's your story, Horace, 
you stick to it.

53:30.040 --> 53:32.531
I suppose you weren't in the park, either.

53:32.609 --> 53:35.203
The park, my dear girl,
it happened in the zoo. What?

53:35.278 --> 53:38.805
The zoo... Yes. The zoo was in the park.
How did you know I was there?

53:38.882 --> 53:42.215
- A little bird told me.
- The stork?

53:43.420 --> 53:45.945
I think, after the trip
 I better clean up a bit.

53:46.023 --> 53:49.015
- Of course, I understand just how you feel.
- Yes.

54:07.077 --> 54:09.307
- What's the matter?
- It's Madge.

54:09.813 --> 54:12.304
- Has she been chasing you?
- No.

54:14.451 --> 54:17.113
Jerry, I think she's found out about Violet.

54:17.254 --> 54:19.188
And I just had my life threatened.

54:20.057 --> 54:21.684
But what did he say?

54:21.758 --> 54:25.922
He just lied in a straightforward manner,
and said he'd never met you.

54:27.397 --> 54:30.764
- He did, did he?
- I told you he'd forget all about you.

54:34.604 --> 54:38.199
I'll make him remember me
in a manner he'll never forget.

54:40.110 --> 54:42.908
Has Horace been away from you lately
for any length of time?

54:42.979 --> 54:45.504
Well, he was alone
on the Continent last year.

54:48.251 --> 54:50.845
Connect me
with Mr. Hardwick's apartment, please.

54:51.021 --> 54:53.615
Madge, have you any objections
if I scare your husband...

54:53.690 --> 54:55.555
so that he'll never look at another woman?

54:55.625 --> 54:59.322
Dale, no husband
is ever too scared to look.

55:00.730 --> 55:01.719
Hello.

55:03.533 --> 55:07.401
Hello, where are you?

55:07.671 --> 55:11.732
So you do remember me?
He remembers me all right.

55:13.510 --> 55:17.469
- Are you alone?
- Completely and desolately.

55:17.814 --> 55:19.406
Fine. I'll be right up.

55:30.527 --> 55:32.552
Horace, she's coming up.

55:32.662 --> 55:35.597
She's coming up here?
She can't do that. It isn't proper.

55:35.665 --> 55:38.327
- She wants to see me alone.
- Alone? Jerry.

55:38.435 --> 55:40.665
What did I tell you?
She wants to compromise you.

55:40.770 --> 55:42.465
Rack your brains, please.

55:42.539 --> 55:45.269
Couldn't you have met
that girl someplace else before?

55:45.342 --> 55:47.936
I could have met her in Moscow.

55:48.145 --> 55:52.343
- In Moscow. You see?
- But I've never been to Moscow.

55:54.384 --> 55:56.375
Couldn't you have met her in Paris?

55:56.486 --> 55:58.954
The last time I was in Paris,
I was 10 years old.

55:59.022 --> 56:03.083
Jerry, I don't think it's safe
for you to see that girl alone.

56:03.260 --> 56:07.356
I don't think it would be quite proper
for you to receive her that way.

56:20.710 --> 56:22.268
Hello.

56:22.445 --> 56:25.676
I know you'll think this is
a little unconventional of me...

56:26.049 --> 56:29.348
but I just couldn't wait to see you alone.

56:36.426 --> 56:39.827
I'm awfully glad you came up.

56:40.964 --> 56:42.829
My darling.

56:45.468 --> 56:48.437
Hello. How have you been?

56:49.372 --> 56:51.670
I've been missing you terribly.

56:52.275 --> 56:55.767
I came down
on the fastest plane I could get.

56:55.979 --> 56:59.176
No, I meant before yesterday.

57:00.684 --> 57:04.381
- Before yesterday?
- Yes, of course.

57:05.822 --> 57:07.619
Don't you remember?

57:08.825 --> 57:11.191
Should I?

57:12.696 --> 57:14.891
Have you forgotten...

57:15.699 --> 57:17.826
- what we've been to each other?
- No.

57:19.402 --> 57:22.599
What we've been to each other...

57:24.207 --> 57:27.904
I knew yesterday in the park,
when I was dancing in your arms...

57:28.178 --> 57:31.443
- you remembered who I was.
- Of course.

57:32.515 --> 57:34.005
Who are you?

57:35.585 --> 57:39.021
Then you still don't remember?

57:41.057 --> 57:43.855
I can try to remember something.

57:45.996 --> 57:49.295
How could you forget
that funny little house...

57:49.733 --> 57:52.099
and the suspicious concierge...

57:53.737 --> 57:56.331
and that quaint little room?

57:57.741 --> 58:00.676
We used to have tea and muffins
in front of the fireplace...

58:01.044 --> 58:03.740
watching the
shadows leaping on the ceiling.

58:05.181 --> 58:09.140
And those long walks down that
twisty cobblestone street to the river.

58:10.987 --> 58:13.854
Paris is heavenly in the spring.

58:22.432 --> 58:24.332
So that's where we met.

58:25.368 --> 58:27.131
Yes, last year.

58:29.406 --> 58:31.033
In Paris.

58:35.278 --> 58:37.109
Why, of course.

58:39.783 --> 58:41.876
It's all coming back to me now.

58:42.619 --> 58:43.608
Is it?

58:44.220 --> 58:46.984
Yes, but you weren't calling
yourself Dale Tremont.

58:48.191 --> 58:51.285
- Wasn't I?
- No, it was...

58:53.163 --> 58:57.623
Madeline, that was it.
I called you Mad for short.

58:58.835 --> 59:01.599
You've put on a little weight, haven't you?

59:04.307 --> 59:06.502
Remember that night on the Left Bank...

59:06.576 --> 59:09.875
you had on that little blue dress
I bought for you?

59:11.948 --> 59:15.714
And to think that I almost forgot you...

59:17.754 --> 59:19.847
Tell me something.

59:22.125 --> 59:25.822
Do you still have that awful weakness
for diamond bracelets?

59:28.798 --> 59:30.857
I suppose I do.

59:31.968 --> 59:35.199
Make yourself comfortable, darling.
I'll order some cocktails.

59:35.271 --> 59:38.536
A little later on,
we'll have supper up here, just we two.

59:38.675 --> 59:41.235
It'll be like old times, won't it?

59:42.946 --> 59:45.210
I think I'd better be going.

59:45.415 --> 59:47.383
I'll let you go on one condition.

59:47.484 --> 59:49.975
Promise me, now that I found you again...

59:50.186 --> 59:53.644
we can be to each other
what we were in Paris.

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:07.993
There, you see? I was right.

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.935
Of all the scheming, brazen creatures...

01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:11.906
trying to pretend
that she met you in Paris.

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:14.637
Do you realize that she's
deliberately trying to trap you?

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:17.271
- What are you going to do about it?
- Marry her.

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:19.315
Jerry, this is no time for you to be funny.

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:20.610
All right, then, you be funny.

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:22.981
I'm going down
and ask her to marry me right now.

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:24.314
Jerry, please wait.

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:27.083
Now, before you make
a complete fool of yourself...

01:00:27.157 --> 01:00:28.818
promise me that you won't ask her...

01:00:28.892 --> 01:00:30.951
until I find out from Madge
more about her past.

01:00:31.027 --> 01:00:33.018
All right, you find out all about her past...

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:34.688
and I'll go down and plan her future.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:38.598
- Remember, that's a promise.
- All right, it's a promise.

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:49.441
What happened? Did you scare him?

01:00:50.747 --> 01:00:54.114
No. He scared me.

01:00:55.552 --> 01:00:58.020
What did he do, make faces at you?

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:01.355
You know, sometimes
I get up in the morning...

01:01:01.424 --> 01:01:04.291
and I take a good look at him
and he frightens me, too.

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:08.264
He mistook me for someone called
Madeline he'd met in Paris.

01:01:08.898 --> 01:01:10.263
Really?

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:13.698
Madge, do you think you ought
to let him go away from you alone?

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:17.729
I don't believe he was nearly so innocent
in Paris as you seem to think.

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:20.742
Darling, you interest me.
I must send him to China next year.

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:23.107
But, Madge,
you don't seem to understand.

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:25.909
I'm trying to tell you that I'm afraid...

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:29.579
that we're carrying this thing too far.

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:35.379
You know, I wonder if you've seen
something in Horace...

01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:36.982
that I've never seen.

01:02:17.534 --> 01:02:19.559
I wonder what's keeping Horace.

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:27.037
What's the matter?

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:29.774
I'm afraid I'm going to have a headache.

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:33.612
Don't go. This is a meeting
I've been planning a long time.

01:02:37.987 --> 01:02:39.750
Good evening.

01:02:40.623 --> 01:02:43.490
It's nice to see you again, Miss Tremont.

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:47.791
You've robbed me of the pleasure
of introducing you two.

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:49.354
You've already met.

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:53.067
Yes, we've met last spring.

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:57.966
I hope you see a lot of each other.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:01.209
You know, Madge is
the most understanding person.

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:04.610
She seems to know instinctively
the kind of girl that interests me.

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:08.310
I don't know what I'd do without her.

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:09.544
That's sweet of you, darling.

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:13.146
You two run along and dance,
and don't give me another thought.

01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:17.952
That's what I'm afraid of.

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:27.231
I think Madge is a very brave person.

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:30.338
Yes, I have
a tremendous admiration for her.

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:47.984
Well, if Madge doesn't care,
I certainly don't.

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:51.390
Neither do I, all I know is that it's...

01:09:15.251 --> 01:09:17.845
Why don't you tell me
what this is all about?

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.115
You know we never met in Paris.

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:24.457
I know. I'm afraid
I haven't been quite fair with you.

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:28.062
You see, I know who you are.

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:31.288
What difference does that make?

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:35.261
- So that doesn't make any difference?
- No, why should it?

01:09:35.438 --> 01:09:38.202
I don't know who you are, and I don't care.

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.505
That's big of you.

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:43.567
Well...

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:47.308
Well, what?

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:49.518
Aren't you now supposed to say...

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:51.951
we should think
only of what we mean to each other...

01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:54.649
that we're entitled to live our own lives?

01:09:56.225 --> 01:10:00.355
I don't think I'd say it
that way exactly, but aren't we?

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:03.458
Go on.

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:07.702
If it weren't for a promise I made
in a moment of weakness...

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:09.465
I would go on.

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:12.104
You made a promise.

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:15.542
That shouldn't make
much difference to you.

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:20.772
That's right. Forget it, marry me.

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:27.278
How could I have fallen in love
with anyone as low as you?

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:36.194
She loves me.

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:44.328
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:47.001
I'm leaving. You don't know
what a mess we've got into.

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:49.169
Why, what's the matter?

01:10:49.512 --> 01:10:51.036
Your husband.

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:56.140
- He wants to divorce you and marry me.
- I see.

01:10:56.819 --> 01:11:00.687
He wants to do right by both of us.
Did he mention any settlement?

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:02.154
No.

01:11:02.224 --> 01:11:03.486
That'll come later.

01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:06.426
He'll probably want me
to pay myself alimony.

01:11:06.495 --> 01:11:10.454
Now listen, Dale. I don't want you to go.
That won't solve anything.

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:13.199
I can't stay here under the circumstances.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.499
Here or there,
as long as you remain a spinster...

01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:18.165
you're fair game for any philandering male.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.936
You know, what you really should have...

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:23.672
is a husband you can call your own.

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:27.845
Seriously, I mean it.

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.911
But what are we going to do
about your husband?

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:33.386
Don't worry, dear. I'll do it.

01:11:39.595 --> 01:11:40.994
Come in.

01:11:43.566 --> 01:11:44.999
Darling.

01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:57.840
All I said was darling and she smacked me.

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:03.378
Jerry, how does it look? Tell me frankly.

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:06.484
It looks like a sunrise by Maxfield Parrish.

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:09.887
Jerry, that's terrible.

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:12.551
I can't go around now like this.

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:16.288
Put a piece of raw steak on it.
That'll take the swelling down.

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:17.729
It would?

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.265
- A steak?
- Sure.

01:12:24.473 --> 01:12:25.462
Yes, sir.

01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:29.972
- Order a steak.
- A steak. Very good, sir.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:34.913
You know, Jerry, I can't imagine
what's got into Madge recently.

01:12:34.984 --> 01:12:36.508
She's never hit me before.

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:40.050
Maybe she just never thought of it before.

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:43.786
Room service.

01:12:44.026 --> 01:12:46.426
Yes. This is the bridal suite.

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:49.626
Yes, will you please send up
a nice, juicy steak?

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:51.793
I beg your pardon?

01:12:52.234 --> 01:12:55.863
Yes, mashed potatoes, and carrots...

01:12:56.539 --> 01:13:00.236
and spinach. Yes, of course, coffee...

01:13:06.282 --> 01:13:09.342
As soon as you get your eye fixed,
we'll go down and see Madge.

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:11.685
Where do you want it, sir?

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.288
- Want what, Bates?
- The steak, sir.

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:16.219
On my eye.

01:13:17.526 --> 01:13:19.391
On your eye, sir?

01:13:20.262 --> 01:13:23.425
My word, why do I always
have to say things twice?

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:25.467
On my eye means on my eye, doesn't it?

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:28.002
- I beg your pardon, sir.
- Don't argue!

01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:31.606
Jerry, you see what I'm up against.

01:13:31.674 --> 01:13:34.802
The man has a sluggish brain,
always wants to debate things.

01:13:34.944 --> 01:13:37.777
First it's a maniac, and then it's Madge,
and now it's Bates.

01:13:37.846 --> 01:13:41.111
I give you my word,
if anything else happens, I'll go insane.

01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:12.508
We are a grand success.

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:15.914
Every woman, she's saying this dress,
she's wonderful.

01:14:15.985 --> 01:14:17.612
This Beddini is the tops.

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:19.551
I'm so happy.

01:14:22.224 --> 01:14:25.921
<i>No, but, cara mia, it's not the dress,
it's not Beddini.</i>

01:14:26.228 --> 01:14:28.162
It's you who wears it.

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:31.929
Thank you, Alberto.

01:14:33.435 --> 01:14:36.666
What is it? Is it Adam again?

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.697
His Garden of Eden...

01:14:39.441 --> 01:14:41.909
he has made you sad?

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:47.077
It's just that I'm all mixed up, that's all.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.276
Why worry about this man?

01:14:50.853 --> 01:14:53.947
I think I'm worrying more about his wife.

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:59.727
Beddini does not like to see you so sad.

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:06.994
Alberto, you seem to be
the only one left I can turn to.

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:14.867
Why don't you marry Beddini?
He'll make you happy.

01:15:16.145 --> 01:15:20.206
Why not? I'm rich, I'm pretty...

01:15:21.317 --> 01:15:24.252
and then this Hardwick
will leave you alone.

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:31.357
I'll marry you if you really want me to...

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.193
but let's do it right away.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.206
First of all,
we'll get you straightened out...

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:49.244
and then I'll ask Madge about Dale.

01:15:49.311 --> 01:15:52.041
Mr. Hardwick, dear sir, one of our
guests has informed us...

01:15:52.114 --> 01:15:53.741
that he is to be married this evening.

01:15:53.816 --> 01:15:56.376
We wondered
if you would give up your bridal suite.

01:15:56.452 --> 01:16:00.081
- Give it up? Why we...
- We've hardly settled in it yet.

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:03.454
- Have we, angel?
- No, and all our clothes are... Please.

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:05.860
- Of course you may have it.
- Thank you, sir.

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:07.919
I shall remove you elsewhere.

01:16:09.198 --> 01:16:11.359
Come on, dear sir, brace up.

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:14.095
Madge has merely heard something
about this Violet girl.

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:16.467
We know it isn't the truth,
you tell her yourself...

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:17.698
that's all she's waiting for.

01:16:17.773 --> 01:16:19.434
I know. That's what I'm afraid of.

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:23.604
Always remember that the truth
has never hurt any man.

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:26.011
Jerry, you are right.

01:16:29.852 --> 01:16:33.310
Anyway, if it does,
I'll go to the hospital with you.

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:39.555
Horace, what is this, Halloween?

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:43.627
Madge, Horace has
a little confession to make.

01:16:44.299 --> 01:16:46.824
I've been waiting for this for some time.

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:49.665
Come right in and get it off your chest.

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:54.165
You'd better take your glasses off.

01:16:58.480 --> 01:16:59.913
Sit down.

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:17.399
You see, when Horace was in London,
he met a certain young lady.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:20.299
And, Madge, you must have
had an inkling of this or...

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:24.839
- Or you wouldn't be telling me now.
- Never. What? Certainly.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:26.869
What Horace means to say is...

01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:29.502
that he'd like to make
a clean breast of the whole thing.

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:34.515
- Before I find out the truth.
- Exactly. Madge, this girl was... What?

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:37.448
Dear, I'm all mixed. Where am I?

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:47.288
- Hello.
- Madge, darling...

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:50.725
I wanted to call you
and tell you I just got married.

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:53.434
You got what?
I'm sorry, dear, I can't hear you.

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:56.164
It sounds just as if you said
you got married.

01:17:56.505 --> 01:18:00.134
- I did.
- Where are you now?

01:18:00.576 --> 01:18:02.806
Going to the bridal suite?

01:18:02.911 --> 01:18:05.277
Very proper place
for a bride and groom, isn't it?

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:07.838
Darling, I must compliment you
on your speedy work...

01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:11.215
but who on earth did you find
to marry you so quickly?

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:14.445
Alberto? You'd better hang up, Dale, dear.

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:17.822
- I think I'm going to faint.
- Dale.

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.584
What was that?

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:22.488
- Dale Tremont married?
- Yes, to that dressmaker.

01:18:22.564 --> 01:18:25.055
- Good.
- Good? What did you have to do with this?

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:26.998
- It's all his fault.
- My fault?

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:31.563
Yes, she told me how you chased her
in the park and she slapped your face.

01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:34.474
Yes, but I'm the one she slapped.

01:18:37.346 --> 01:18:40.782
She's been mistaking me
for Horace all this time.

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:44.078
No wonder she thought
Horace was fascinating.

01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:46.916
No wonder. I resent that.

01:18:47.222 --> 01:18:50.623
- Madge, where is she now?
- On her way to the bridal suite.

01:18:50.759 --> 01:18:52.090
Bridal suite.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:58.999
I'll see you later.

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:01.865
But, Jerry, you can't do a thing like that.
It isn't fair.

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:05.429
All is fair in love and war,
and this is revolution.

01:19:09.177 --> 01:19:11.771
- Yes, this is very pretty.
- Thank you, dear sir.

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:14.177
We are very proud
of our bridal arrangements.

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:15.739
Is there anything else, sir?

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:18.809
Yes, would you please ask my wife
to join me here?

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:21.014
It is a pleasure, dear sir.

01:19:45.013 --> 01:19:46.981
What are you doing here?

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:50.414
- What are you doing here?
- Yes, but this is my room.

01:19:50.652 --> 01:19:54.884
- Yes, but this is my room.
- But I have the key.

01:19:55.891 --> 01:19:57.825
But I have the key.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:03.126
- But I am Beddini.
- You got me there, pal.

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:07.702
We will see who is the owner of this room.

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:27.119
But, Jerry, you shouldn't be in here.

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:31.250
- It isn't cricket.
- No, Horace, it isn't tiddlywinks either.

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:42.670
<i>Signor, there is a man in my bed.</i>

01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:50.003
It's too bad. He's not here yet.

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:52.872
I'll just wait until my uncle returns.

01:20:53.415 --> 01:20:54.541
Thank you.

01:20:54.616 --> 01:20:57.710
Why, Jerry, I didn't know
that you had an uncle here.

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:59.378
- Didn't you know?
- No.

01:20:59.454 --> 01:21:03.288
I haven't, but this room is
just above the bridal suite.

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:09.659
<i>He's not here, signor.
If he returns, you will call us.</i>

01:21:09.731 --> 01:21:11.926
If he returns, I will kill him.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.868
We Beddini have the motto:
For the woman, the kiss.

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:18.332
For the man, the sword.

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:05.743
Dale, you are lovely.

01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:09.820
Like a flower I am afraid to crush.

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:11.415
Don't be afraid.

01:22:20.068 --> 01:22:22.093
Alberto, make him stop!

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:24.532
Who is it? You know?

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:26.833
Yes, it's Horace.

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:29.738
Horace Hardwick, that interloper.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:32.413
I'll stop him.

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:41.713
For the man, the sword.

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:55.426
Mrs. Hardwick's apartment, please.

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:04.837
- He's coming.
- Is he?

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:07.347
You keep this up and hold him
here as long as you can.

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:08.404
I will.

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:23.789
Madge, you'd better come over
and rescue Horace.

01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:25.662
Alberto has gone after him with a sword.

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:42.343
Why, yes, of course.

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:56.154
I'm sorry to break in like this,
but I simply had to see you.

01:23:56.565 --> 01:23:58.897
Will you please stop annoying me?

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:01.197
But you've been mistaken about me.

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:04.266
- I'm afraid I haven't.
- All right, then.

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:07.502
I'll stay right here and there will be
a scene with your husband.

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:11.406
He'll be furious if he finds you here.

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:13.480
Then please come with me
for a few minutes.

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:16.039
I've simply got to talk to you.

01:24:18.587 --> 01:24:22.182
And so you see, my dear chap,
I am definitely the wrong person.

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:25.715
- But you are Horace Hardwick, no?
- Yes, of course I am Horace Hardwick.

01:24:25.794 --> 01:24:29.753
Then you are not
the wrong person. Prepare.

01:24:35.503 --> 01:24:37.698
Don't mind me.
I just came up to see the fun.

01:24:37.772 --> 01:24:41.538
Madge, explain to this maniac that
he is making a very serious mistake.

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:44.871
He may be making a mistake,
but it's not serious.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.048
Go right ahead, Alberto.

01:24:47.148 --> 01:24:49.810
No, I cannot kill him before a lady.

01:24:50.085 --> 01:24:54.283
If you're going to pull out on us, Alberto,
maybe it's best that you don't kill him.

01:24:54.356 --> 01:24:56.756
I may want that pleasure myself someday.

01:25:00.495 --> 01:25:03.225
But why didn't you tell me who you were?

01:25:03.632 --> 01:25:08.035
After all, I mean, you never gave me
very much of a chance.

01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:19.179
Mr. Travers!

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:23.375
Help, somebody.

01:25:23.818 --> 01:25:27.117
I am so sorry.
I really did not want to kill you.

01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:29.985
- You must forgive me.
- I forgive you.

01:25:33.328 --> 01:25:35.660
Go right ahead, boys, don't mind me.

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:38.392
Not tonight, Alberto.

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:40.297
Some other time
when I'm feeling stronger.

01:25:40.402 --> 01:25:41.835
Thank you.

01:25:42.037 --> 01:25:44.164
- Pardon me, sir.
- What is it? What's the matter?

01:25:44.239 --> 01:25:45.729
What have you been doing?

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:48.469
Pardon me, sir,
Mr. Travers and Miss Tremont, sir...

01:25:48.543 --> 01:25:51.535
they're drifting out to the bay
in a gondola, sir.

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:54.741
There. That ought to make you
feel pretty small, accusing me.

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:57.307
- He's kidnapped her.
- Kidnapped her?

01:25:58.219 --> 01:26:01.450
You are in this plot.
You are cahooting with him.

01:26:01.556 --> 01:26:03.080
I've had just about enough...

01:26:03.158 --> 01:26:05.786
Children, if Dale and Jerry
are drifting out to sea...

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.454
don't you think the best thing
we could do is rescue them?

01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:09.724
Yes, come.

01:26:10.065 --> 01:26:13.125
Isn't it marvelous to have some brains?
I'm always so helpless.

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:15.897
Don't answer me like that. Do something.

01:26:17.939 --> 01:26:20.533
- Jerry.
- That isn't Jerry.

01:26:20.608 --> 01:26:22.439
That's right. Make a fool of yourself.

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:24.842
It's no crime to look, is it?

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:33.446
- I think there is no gas left.
- My word, no petrol?

01:26:33.655 --> 01:26:36.021
Perhaps I'd better look at the engine,
where is it?

01:26:36.091 --> 01:26:38.491
They may have hidden it up there
under the hood.

01:26:43.498 --> 01:26:47.457
This is the first time
I ever had to walk back from a boat ride.

01:26:50.739 --> 01:26:54.334
Jerry, you mustn't come with me.
I'd rather talk to Alberto alone.

01:26:54.409 --> 01:26:57.344
Alberto will have to get accustomed
to talking in front of me.

01:26:57.412 --> 01:27:00.313
No, seriously,
I'd rather you wouldn't. Please.

01:27:00.615 --> 01:27:02.583
When am I going to see you again?

01:27:04.185 --> 01:27:05.709
I don't know.

01:27:09.824 --> 01:27:14.090
Mr. Travers, they went after you, sir,
to look for you, sir, in a motorboat.

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:17.824
- Mr. Beddini, too?
- Yes, sir, all three of them...

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:19.958
but they won't be back this evening, sir.

01:27:20.035 --> 01:27:22.936
We took the precaution
of removing the gasoline.

01:27:24.039 --> 01:27:26.371
Thank you, Bates.

01:27:39.821 --> 01:27:41.789
What is it, my good man?

01:27:45.493 --> 01:27:49.122
Yes. I'm masquerading.

01:27:54.903 --> 01:27:56.803
Don't you understand English?

01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:01.168
You don't understand English?

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:07.013
Well, I've been waiting for an opportunity
like this since my childhood.

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:10.515
You frozen-faced flatfoot.

01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:17.084
<i>And grazie to you if it comes to that,
you stultified shrimp.</i>

01:28:20.929 --> 01:28:24.296
Can I help it if you look
like a mildewed donkey?

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:31.394
<i>I'm adoring this.
And grazie to you, since you insist.</i>

01:28:31.606 --> 01:28:36.600
You see, I happen to be breaking the law.
I admit it wholeheartedly...

01:28:36.744 --> 01:28:40.840
but, of course, you would never know that,
you fish-faced nincompoop.

01:28:43.017 --> 01:28:44.348
Good night.

01:28:50.892 --> 01:28:53.486
I arrest you for masquerading
as a gondolier.

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:56.530
I further charge you with insulting
an officer with vile names...

01:28:56.598 --> 01:29:00.398
according to Rule Three, Section Three
of the law dealing with delinquents.

01:29:13.515 --> 01:29:15.983
<i>Beg your pardon, signoro,
the carnival is beginning.</i>

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:18.644
Shall I serve now
or will you wait for the groom?

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.587
I don't think the groom
will be here tonight.

01:29:21.656 --> 01:29:24.420
- Very good, sir.
- Very good? It's perfect.

01:29:24.492 --> 01:29:27.052
I still feel a little guilty
being here with you...

01:29:27.128 --> 01:29:29.323
while Alberto's out looking for us.

01:29:29.397 --> 01:29:32.889
Let's eat, drink, and be merry,
for tomorrow we have to face him.

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:13.533
The hour of reckoning is at hand.

01:36:13.734 --> 01:36:16.567
Beddini is about to settle his accounts.

01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:27.743
Skipper, will you tell
my husband we're here?

01:36:33.087 --> 01:36:35.612
He's the one with his mouth closed.

01:36:42.363 --> 01:36:45.526
Listen, you two idiots,
Alberto is as mad as a drunken toreador.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:48.160
- Where is he?
- He's gone up to the room.

01:36:48.235 --> 01:36:51.671
If you take my advice, you'll take
the first plane back to London pronto.

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:55.800
Not until I've asked Mr. Beddini for his
wife's hand. Do you think he'll accept me?

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:02.777
- Mr. Hardwick.
- What do you want?

01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:06.445
I regret to report, my dear sir,
that your manservant has been arrested.

01:37:06.621 --> 01:37:08.987
- Bates? Really?
- Yes, sir.

01:37:09.056 --> 01:37:12.423
He would have spent the whole night
in jail if I had not bailed him out.

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:13.517
You don't mean it.

01:37:18.399 --> 01:37:19.866
Come in.

01:37:25.272 --> 01:37:27.001
At last.

01:37:27.642 --> 01:37:30.941
The little birdies have come flying back
to the rooster.

01:37:34.615 --> 01:37:38.051
Mr. Beddini, we want to explain
this whole thing to you.

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:42.645
I will not listen to any excuses,
not even the truth.

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:46.585
Jerry, Madge,
I have the most amazing news.

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:49.993
A few days ago,
my invaluable manservant, Bates...

01:37:50.064 --> 01:37:52.555
Allow me to tell them, sir, please.

01:37:52.633 --> 01:37:55.227
Quiet, your turn will come later.

01:37:55.302 --> 01:37:57.998
A few days ago,
my invaluable manservant, Bates...

01:37:58.072 --> 01:38:02.008
The needle has gotten stuck in a crack.
You tell it, Bates.

01:38:02.309 --> 01:38:04.174
Thank you, madam.

01:38:07.748 --> 01:38:11.275
You see, Miss Dale, Mr. Hardwick thought
you were a dangerous woman.

01:38:11.352 --> 01:38:15.789
And he asked me to follow you
in case you did something dangerous.

01:38:16.957 --> 01:38:18.982
- Follow me?
- Yes, miss.

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:23.121
And in order to put you off the scent,
I thought of many little disguises.

01:38:23.631 --> 01:38:26.725
This evening, I met
Mr. Beddini and Miss Tremont...

01:38:27.068 --> 01:38:29.093
and fearing
that they might recognize me...

01:38:29.170 --> 01:38:31.604
I turned my collar around...

01:38:32.073 --> 01:38:33.734
like this.

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:39.008
And very cleverly, I became a clergyman.

01:38:41.549 --> 01:38:43.881
You are the one who married us.

01:38:44.051 --> 01:38:45.712
Yes, sir.

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:48.648
Then we've never been really married?

01:38:48.923 --> 01:38:50.948
Precisely, miss.

01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:55.525
Well, Mr. Beddini...

01:38:56.197 --> 01:38:59.894
what are you doing
in this young lady's room?
