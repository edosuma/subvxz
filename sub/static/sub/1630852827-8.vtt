WEBVTT

00:26.720 --> 00:27.960
That son of a...

00:47.080 --> 00:48.440
Is someone in there?

00:57.760 --> 00:59.600
I'll break the door down.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.880
You've been in there
half an hour!

01:11.920 --> 01:13.560
WC
OUT OF SERVICE

01:13.720 --> 01:16.000
Dude, everyone has
to use the bathroom.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.360
What a mess he made.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.040
There are blankets in the closet
and comfy clothes.

01:48.040 --> 01:48.120
There are blankets in the closet
and comfy clothes.
I have clothes.

01:48.120 --> 01:49.200
I have clothes.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.960
We try to make our patients
as comfortable as possible.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.080
Try to rest.

01:54.080 --> 01:54.160
Try to rest.
You have group therapy
first thing.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.080
You have group therapy
first thing.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.960
-Therapy?
-There's the schedule

01:58.080 --> 01:59.120
with all the times.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.880
-You wake us up at 8am?
-Is that too early?

02:05.160 --> 02:06.360
Ten hours of sleep?

02:07.040 --> 02:10.120
-I usually get four.
-But you agreed to come here.

02:10.120 --> 02:10.160
-I usually get four.
-But you agreed to come here.
-You're in our hands here.
-So I see.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.400
-You're in our hands here.
-So I see.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.160
You have to give me your phone.

02:16.280 --> 02:17.600
-My phone?
-It's a window

02:17.760 --> 02:19.920
to the outside,
which is no good.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.720
I have to call my daughter.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.120
Or my mom, my colleagues.

02:24.280 --> 02:26.000
There's a phone
in the stairwell.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.640
There's a schedule,
you can put your name down.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.040
Another list?

02:35.840 --> 02:36.840
Thank you.

02:37.920 --> 02:38.920
Rest up.

03:52.640 --> 03:53.640
I...

03:54.080 --> 03:55.080
I need you.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.200
Who is this?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
What are you doing?

04:04.040 --> 04:07.120
It was ringing and...
I thought it might be urgent.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.280
-Why is it hidden?
-It's not hidden.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.320
Right, but...

04:12.640 --> 04:15.840
there's a key under the drawer
and you have another phone.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.160
This is my work one.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.520
You speak to patients
on the other one.

04:23.080 --> 04:26.120
Hey, do I go into your room
and rifle through your stuff?

04:27.880 --> 04:28.880
No.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.240
It's just a bit weird, Grandma.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.440
Okay, fine.

04:34.600 --> 04:35.600
You got me.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.280
I'm a Russian spy.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.120
And now...

04:43.120 --> 04:44.640
I'll have to kill you.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.680
Go on, go to your room

04:49.840 --> 04:51.480
-and stop fantasizing.
-Okay.

04:52.480 --> 04:55.040
I'm just saying,
it didn't sound like a patient.

04:55.160 --> 04:56.160
Sorry?

04:56.920 --> 04:58.960
It was an unknown number

04:59.120 --> 05:02.280
and a man picked up
saying he needed you.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Exactly, a patient.

05:07.600 --> 05:11.160
The way he said he needed you,
he didn't sound like a patient.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.040
What are you doing?

05:46.120 --> 05:48.160
What are you doing?
That's rat poison.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.000
It's poison, dammit.

05:51.160 --> 05:53.080
-I can't go on.
-You must never give up.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.000
-Never.
-Who cares?

05:55.280 --> 05:58.480
-You'll kill me anyway.
-Why wouldn't I have already?

05:58.680 --> 05:59.720
Come on, up.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.360
You'll get out of here alive.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.560
-When?
-Tomorrow.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.840
Now, let's get down to it.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.000
I'm just going to shave you.
You're in a weird mood today.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.320
Chin.

06:40.640 --> 06:42.960
Better like this than dry,
right?

06:44.520 --> 06:46.240
Edmond Dantés never gave up.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.880
Edmond Dantés? I...
don't know who he is.

06:51.600 --> 06:55.240
Right. The Count of Montecristo,
by Alejandro Dumas.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.080
You haven't read it?

06:57.840 --> 06:58.880
No.

06:59.640 --> 07:00.720
Well...

07:01.520 --> 07:04.760
it's about a man
who's locked up,

07:07.640 --> 07:10.080
despite being innocent.
A real drama.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.360
He spends years in jail.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.840
And the whole time he's there,
day after day,

07:19.080 --> 07:21.240
he devises the ultimate revenge.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.040
Killing someone is easy...

07:25.120 --> 07:26.600
but the dead don't suffer.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.320
Living through hell
is what destroys you.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.160
Help me, please.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.320
-Please.
-My God.

08:34.040 --> 08:35.360
Help me, please.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
But...

08:39.840 --> 08:43.120
-You have to go to hospital.
-No. You help me.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.240
Get the bullet out.

08:46.440 --> 08:47.440
What? Me?

08:48.880 --> 08:50.080
Please.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.480
-Take it out.
-I can't.

09:30.680 --> 09:31.880
-Get it out.
-I can't.

09:32.800 --> 09:33.840
Please.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.320
Take it out.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.400
Come on, get it out.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.120
No, I can't. I can't.

10:04.120 --> 10:04.160
No, I can't. I can't.
Do it!

10:04.160 --> 10:05.280
Do it!

10:09.120 --> 10:10.600
What the hell...?

10:21.080 --> 10:22.560
Police, how can we help?

10:22.680 --> 10:25.120
I'm at the boarding house
on De la Cruz Street.

10:39.960 --> 10:42.000
-You requested to send flowers?
-Yes.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.200
I already sent the address.
Just a second, please.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.960
-Aren't you signing the card?
-It's a surprise.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.160
There we go.

11:32.800 --> 11:33.920
It's done.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.960
It's here, room seven.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.760
There was yelling,
like they were killing someone.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.760
Police, open up, please.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.520
Police!

12:01.080 --> 12:02.080
Should I open it?

12:02.720 --> 12:03.800
Go ahead.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.680
Is there a problem?

12:09.880 --> 12:12.000
Morning, sorry to disturb you.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.720
We got reports of screams
coming from this room.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.560
-Screams? Really?
-Yes, screams.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.240
-What the hell's going on?
-Wait there, please.

12:21.680 --> 12:25.160
-Can you identify yourself?
-Yes. I'm Andrea Llanes Castro.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.480
Do you have company?

12:28.320 --> 12:30.920
Isn't that obvious?
Is something wrong?

12:31.560 --> 12:33.360
No, nothing's wrong.

12:35.360 --> 12:38.120
I do what I like with
who I like. Is that a crime?

12:38.720 --> 12:39.720
No.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.480
As for the alleged screaming,

12:43.320 --> 12:44.760
did something happen?

12:44.920 --> 12:47.000
Well, that's what comes
with maturity.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
A certain wisdom, particularly
in matters of pleasure.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.680
-Anything else?
-No.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.920
Sorry, we have to check
everything's in order.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.040
Of course. I understand.

13:03.640 --> 13:04.880
Good day.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.400
What the hell...?

13:35.360 --> 13:37.760
-What are you doing?
-Parking in my space.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.000
-It's not yours anymore.
-It has been for years.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.080
You were on the Parot case
for weeks and they took you off.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.440
Excuse me?

13:45.640 --> 13:47.800
-I didn't catch that.
-He's deaf, too.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.000
Perhaps it's time
to take a desk job.

13:50.480 --> 13:53.120
Perhaps you should find
somewhere else to park.

13:53.120 --> 13:53.160
Perhaps you should find
somewhere else to park.
You're in the way.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.120
You're in the way.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.280
-Hey.
-Good move with the car.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.200
He just got here
and I'm already sick of him.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.560
He asked the girl

14:07.680 --> 14:10.440
at front desk
to buy him oat milk.

14:12.360 --> 14:15.560
My buddy, who works downtown,
told me something interesting.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.240
-What's that?
-They were called out

14:17.400 --> 14:19.720
to a disturbance
at a boarding house today.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.840
-So?
-When they arrived,

14:21.960 --> 14:23.680
they found a woman and a guy...

14:24.880 --> 14:25.960
And?

14:26.560 --> 14:27.800
It was Isabel's mom.

14:29.680 --> 14:31.120
-Isabel's mom?
-Yes, it was her.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.760
They identified her.

14:33.560 --> 14:36.600
She's a grown woman
and can be with who she wants.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.040
Don't you think it's weird
Isabel's in an asylum...

14:39.240 --> 14:40.280
Stop.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.000
Not a word of this to Isabel
when she's back.

14:44.160 --> 14:46.040
That's if she comes back, man.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.480
Welcome to this first session.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.880
Over the coming weeks,

14:54.040 --> 14:56.600
we'll see each other
here every day.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.680
So, let's start by sharing
the reason we're here

15:00.360 --> 15:02.200
with the rest of the group.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.080
I'll remind you
this is a safe space

15:05.840 --> 15:08.560
and nobody will judge
anything you say.

15:10.120 --> 15:11.160
Alright?

15:14.640 --> 15:17.440
-Whenever you're ready.
-My...

15:18.160 --> 15:21.440
My twin sister disappeared
when she was 15

15:22.160 --> 15:25.000
and, well...
I never heard from her again.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.400
My girlfriend died.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.720
I was by her side.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.680
On one of the trains bombed
in Madrid in 2014.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.280
My baby.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.760
I dropped him,
he slipped out my hands.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.320
Now he has brain damage.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.080
It's okay.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.360
When you're ready.

15:57.600 --> 15:58.880
I'd rather not speak.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.960
Your peers have spoken,
it's... a good thing.

16:05.920 --> 16:08.800
-Is it mandatory?
-It's part of the therapy.

16:16.720 --> 16:17.720
Right.

16:18.600 --> 16:21.600
You think not talking about it
means it will disappear.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.120
But it won't,
it'll always be there.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.440
What I do or don't believe
is my business.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.920
-And mine as your therapist.
-I didn't want to come.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.040
But you had to.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.000
I read your report.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.040
Denialism,

16:35.240 --> 16:37.600
self-destructive behavior,
not to mention...

16:37.720 --> 16:39.320
Patients are free from judgment?

16:44.840 --> 16:46.800
What's the purpose of your life?

16:49.080 --> 16:50.240
To keep being a victim?

16:52.640 --> 16:56.040
No, I don't live as a victim,
I don't consider myself one.

17:06.200 --> 17:10.520
Imagine that 16-year-old you
is sitting in this chair.

17:11.080 --> 17:13.200
Something awful
just happened to you...

17:13.320 --> 17:15.040
I'd rather not imagine it,
thanks.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.840
What would
that girl tell you?

17:20.360 --> 17:21.360
I don't know.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.160
But I'm not doing this.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.040
It says here you open
at 9am, right?

17:43.080 --> 17:44.160
It's now 9:10.

17:45.080 --> 17:48.000
A contract with your clients
that you're breaching.

17:48.000 --> 17:48.040
A contract with your clients
that you're breaching.
-Traffic.
-Traffic?

17:48.040 --> 17:50.040
-Traffic.
-Traffic?

17:50.040 --> 17:50.120
-Traffic.
-Traffic?
Or you open up when
you damn well feel like it?

17:50.120 --> 17:52.360
Or you open up when
you damn well feel like it?

17:55.560 --> 17:58.320
Incompetence and laziness
have ruined this country.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.120
"Spain, land of festive
frivolity,

18:02.120 --> 18:04.120
of sardonic spirit
and stagnant soul."

18:06.680 --> 18:09.120
Do you have the old newspapers
I asked for?

18:19.800 --> 18:21.840
Well, at least you did
something right.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.240
Would you like a bag?

18:52.160 --> 18:54.160
She seemed
like such a normal girl...

19:15.640 --> 19:16.640
Please.

19:18.320 --> 19:21.720
Excuse me, I'm here...
Well, perhaps it's not here.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.560
Complaints, at front desk.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.800
I don't know if it's a complaint
or...

19:25.960 --> 19:27.560
Well, come back when you do.

19:27.760 --> 19:28.960
This is a police station.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.840
I saw something
that might be connected

19:32.000 --> 19:33.800
to that monkey killer,
yesterday.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.120
That case belongs to...

19:43.600 --> 19:44.600
Well.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.560
Come this way.

19:51.680 --> 19:54.520
I was in the bar last night
and needed to pee.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.960
But there was someone
in the bathroom and the guy...

19:58.480 --> 20:00.040
wasn't coming out.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.200
-You get me?
-I do.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.720
He eventually came out
and he dropped the mask.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.120
The monkey mask.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.560
Like the one on TV.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.240
-Did you see his face?
-No.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.800
He had his hood up.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.720
He was hiding the mask.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.080
Why didn't you report this
last night?

20:18.280 --> 20:19.280
Well, I wasn't...

20:20.120 --> 20:22.920
I wasn't in the best shape.
I was pretty wasted.

20:25.120 --> 20:28.040
"I was really drunk."
Are you sure of what you saw?

20:29.920 --> 20:32.440
The first thing I thought of
this morning,

20:32.600 --> 20:33.760
when I felt human,

20:35.680 --> 20:36.680
was the mask.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.400
And then, the blood.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.040
What blood?

20:43.520 --> 20:45.040
The blood in the toilet.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.560
The toilet, the floor,
the sink...

20:48.240 --> 20:49.480
It was everywhere.

20:52.760 --> 20:53.800
Sorry.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.600
You took your time
with the lock.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.920
It's a long way down from here.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.000
-Best to avoid accidents.
-Sure.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.120
But I won't be having
any accidents.

21:03.240 --> 21:04.960
Sure. But I don't know that.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.280
If you tried it once,

21:06.480 --> 21:08.720
-you could do it again.
-What did I try?

21:09.240 --> 21:11.800
-Say it.
-Two suicide attempts.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.320
The latest was just days ago.

21:14.840 --> 21:17.560
I don't mean to bother you,
I just brought you these.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.400
YOU HAVE TO STAY STRONG
THE BEST IS YET TO COME

24:49.040 --> 24:51.080
EL MOLINILLO BAR

25:08.040 --> 25:09.840
-Hello?
-Hello.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.080
-Who is it?
-Nieto, can you hear me?

25:12.200 --> 25:14.400
-It's Isabel.
-Isabel.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.560
-How are you?
-Good, I'm good.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.800
You didn't need
to send anything.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.520
Sorry? What?

25:27.480 --> 25:28.720
The yellow roses...

25:29.600 --> 25:31.280
you sent me and the card...

25:31.880 --> 25:34.880
Damn.
"The best is yet to come".

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
Will you be long?

25:38.160 --> 25:39.160
I just started.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.480
I didn't send you anything.

25:48.320 --> 25:49.960
They weren't from you?

25:51.080 --> 25:52.080
No.

25:55.160 --> 25:58.040
I'd never apologize like that.
What I did was...

25:58.160 --> 26:00.560
Okay. There's nothing left
to say, then.

27:04.600 --> 27:08.040
You have to try and get up.
We have to change the sheets.

27:14.120 --> 27:15.120
Come on.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.440
Thank you.

28:16.040 --> 28:18.040
"That's why I decided
to write to you,

28:18.040 --> 28:18.120
"That's why I decided
to write to you,
rather than going
through lawyers.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.720
rather than going
through lawyers.

28:19.840 --> 28:21.960
At the end of the day,
I'm your father

28:22.080 --> 28:24.040
and I feel responsible
for your actions.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.000
I've decided that my fortune,

28:26.000 --> 28:26.040
I've decided that my fortune,
which I told you
you won't be seeing,

28:26.040 --> 28:28.080
which I told you
you won't be seeing,

28:28.800 --> 28:30.960
will go to your victims,
those poor girls

28:31.080 --> 28:33.880
whose innocence
and youth you stole.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.040
I'm leaving them
the house in Sotogrande,

28:36.040 --> 28:36.080
I'm leaving them
the house in Sotogrande,
the two estates in Toledo..."

28:36.080 --> 28:37.600
the two estates in Toledo..."

28:46.120 --> 28:47.160
Son of a... !

28:53.400 --> 28:56.280
You have a 20-minute break
before the next activity.

29:17.880 --> 29:19.880
-How's it going?
-All good.

30:15.880 --> 30:16.880
Relax, it's me.

30:17.760 --> 30:19.080
Are you stupid?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.080
You scared me.
What are you doing in the woods?

30:22.600 --> 30:24.120
It's like this or not at all.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.080
They won't let me see you,
you hang up when I call.

30:27.200 --> 30:30.080
I'm here to get away
from negative stimuli,

30:30.080 --> 30:30.120
I'm here to get away
from negative stimuli,
-but it's impossible.
-Nice way to label me.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.520
-but it's impossible.
-Nice way to label me.

30:38.040 --> 30:41.720
-Why are you here?
-I wanted to see how you were.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.080
Okay, now you've seen me.

30:44.520 --> 30:45.720
Go back to your life.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.120
Solve the case,
now that I can't.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.280
I'm off the case.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.120
What?

30:56.400 --> 30:58.120
They threw me off it.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.120
Why?

31:01.880 --> 31:05.000
-Apparently, I can't cut it.
-Why did they drop you?

31:06.120 --> 31:07.800
Neglecting my professional duty.

31:08.280 --> 31:11.040
So, letting personal issues
affect the investigation.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.240
It's because of me?

31:16.560 --> 31:17.680
It's because of me.

31:21.400 --> 31:22.760
Who's in charge now?

31:23.520 --> 31:25.080
Some asshole they brought in.

31:26.560 --> 31:27.600
Goddammit.

31:27.840 --> 31:29.080
Where did you leave off?

31:31.680 --> 31:33.360
Forget the case.
You should rest.

31:33.480 --> 31:34.920
What did you find?

31:36.680 --> 31:38.840
A guy showed up today
saying he saw someone

31:38.960 --> 31:41.000
in a bar last night
with the monkey mask.

31:41.160 --> 31:42.880
He left the place
covered in blood.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.280
Is he reliable?

31:44.480 --> 31:45.920
Well, he was drunk.

31:46.120 --> 31:48.320
-We'd have to check it out.
-Where's the bar?

31:48.480 --> 31:50.280
Molineros Street,
in the suburbs.

31:50.440 --> 31:52.680
What am I doing?
They took my phone.

31:52.800 --> 31:53.800
Give me yours.

31:55.360 --> 31:56.360
Please.

32:00.200 --> 32:01.200
Let's see...

32:02.160 --> 32:03.120
where that bar is.

32:15.240 --> 32:18.680
LA FLORIDA GATED COMPLEX

32:19.120 --> 32:20.680
La Florida Gated Complex.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Who lives there?

32:27.880 --> 32:29.240
The son of a bitch, Haro.

32:53.240 --> 32:58.160
I HEARD YOU'RE OFF THE CASE

33:03.560 --> 33:04.560
Can we talk?

33:05.560 --> 33:07.040
I can't. I'm in a hurry.

33:07.680 --> 33:08.840
I can't hear you.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.960
-I'm in a hurry.
-I can't hear you.

33:17.760 --> 33:21.040
I want to tell you something.
Something nobody else knows.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
What's it about?

33:26.800 --> 33:28.760
Can I get in
or will you get out?

33:28.920 --> 33:33.000
-It's a bit difficult like this.
-Like this is fine. Go ahead.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.400
It's something
the public should know.

33:40.920 --> 33:43.000
They know everything
about you already.

33:43.600 --> 33:44.600
Not everything.

33:50.160 --> 33:53.120
CALL ME

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Do any other ex-cons live
near the bar?

33:56.000 --> 33:56.080
Do any other ex-cons live
near the bar?
No.

33:56.080 --> 33:57.000
No.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.240
You know all
their addresses from memory?

33:59.400 --> 34:00.480
That's right.

34:04.160 --> 34:06.560
I'd forgotten your memory
is one of your...

34:07.400 --> 34:08.400
strengths.

34:10.160 --> 34:12.080
And never giving up
is one of yours.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.800
Let's stop flattering
each other...

34:29.680 --> 34:30.760
and do some work.

34:32.520 --> 34:35.680
Do you realize they had
to throw us both off the case

34:36.080 --> 34:38.120
for us
to start working together?

34:48.160 --> 34:49.160
Ana Hurtado.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.040
It just had to be her.

34:52.200 --> 34:54.080
You don't know
what our relationship was.

34:54.200 --> 34:55.400
No.

34:55.600 --> 34:56.920
Just that you had sex,

34:57.080 --> 34:59.040
hours after spending
the night with me.

34:59.040 --> 34:59.120
hours after spending
the night with me.
-Yes.
-That's all I need to know.

34:59.120 --> 35:00.800
-Yes.
-That's all I need to know.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.520
I was angry because you thought
I'd taken the photo

35:03.680 --> 35:05.720
-with your phone and then...
-Sure.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.040
That's an excuse
that makes perfect sense.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.040
-It's not an excuse.
-Don't grab me.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.120
You don't owe me an explanation.

35:14.320 --> 35:18.080
I wanted to. I came last night
but they wouldn't let me in.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.560
I'm glad, or I'd have had
to throw you out myself.

35:23.400 --> 35:26.080
-I don't believe you.
-Really?

35:32.160 --> 35:33.800
There is one thing I'm sure of.

35:37.560 --> 35:39.080
You've never believed in me.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.760
You couldn't even be
a good partner.

35:47.080 --> 35:50.120
-Isabel, let me explain.
-You don't have to,

35:50.120 --> 35:51.520
there's nothing between us.

35:57.080 --> 36:01.000
I'm going, or I'll be late
for biofeedback class...

36:01.000 --> 36:01.040
I'm going, or I'll be late
for biofeedback class...
or whatever the hell
it's called.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.040
or whatever the hell
it's called.

36:13.480 --> 36:15.880
My parents would chain me
to the radiator.

36:17.640 --> 36:18.640
For hours.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.520
And I have a scar
on my back because...

36:27.600 --> 36:30.360
when I was five,
they burned me with a hot poker.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.120
When I cried, they'd push
my head underwater

36:37.120 --> 36:37.160
When I cried, they'd push
my head underwater
until I stopped.

36:37.160 --> 36:38.160
until I stopped.

36:47.760 --> 36:49.800
I wouldn't wish my childhood
on anyone.

36:54.320 --> 36:55.320
Anyone.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.400
-That's him, right?
-Yes, that's him.

37:11.200 --> 37:13.520
Mr. López de Haro,
may we ask some questions?

37:13.680 --> 37:15.200
-What's this?
-We just want answers.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.000
Turn the camera off, please.

37:17.000 --> 37:17.040
Turn the camera off, please.
Do you know what your
son's accused you of?

37:17.040 --> 37:18.960
Do you know what your
son's accused you of?

37:19.080 --> 37:20.480
What crap is he saying?

37:20.600 --> 37:22.080
About what you did to him
as a boy?

37:22.240 --> 37:23.240
What...?

37:26.120 --> 37:27.120
What's he saying?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.160
Your son has accused you
of child abuse.

37:32.480 --> 37:35.040
-Your wife as well.
-What?

37:35.160 --> 37:37.600
He claims his own mother
abused him, is it true?

37:38.480 --> 37:41.000
Look here,
stop with this madness.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.920
My wife never abused him.
She never laid a hand on him.

37:45.080 --> 37:47.520
And neither did I.
Now, turn off the camera.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.440
Get out of here.
Leave me alone.

37:49.560 --> 37:52.000
-We just want to confirm...
-Leave me be!

37:52.720 --> 37:53.720
Are you alright?

37:54.240 --> 37:55.240
Are you okay?

37:55.680 --> 37:57.160
Javi, call an ambulance!

37:58.120 --> 37:59.120
Shit.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.600
ACCUSED OF CHILD ABUSE
BY HIS SON,

38:02.720 --> 38:06.000
THE MARQUESS OF VALMESADO
HAS HEART ATTACK IN THE STREET

38:09.520 --> 38:11.200
You were asking for it, Dad.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.000
PLANET SOUND FESTIVAL TICKET

38:18.080 --> 38:19.080
PRINTING

38:19.240 --> 38:20.760
CONNECTED

38:34.320 --> 38:37.760
CONGRATS, YOU'VE WON TWO TICKETS
TO PLANET SOUND FESTIVAL

38:53.280 --> 38:54.280
What do you want?

38:54.640 --> 38:56.800
I'm hardly thrilled
to see you too.

38:57.280 --> 38:59.240
But I have
some questions for you.

38:59.360 --> 39:01.000
And you think I'll answer?

39:01.800 --> 39:04.120
We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

39:04.120 --> 39:04.160
We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.
You answer me politely
or I get a warrant

39:04.160 --> 39:06.320
You answer me politely
or I get a warrant

39:06.440 --> 39:09.120
-and you come to the station.
-So, get that warrant.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.920
I'm trying to find out
who's killing you guys.

39:13.280 --> 39:15.000
Why didn't you say so?

39:15.920 --> 39:18.720
It's hard to understand you
if you're not explicit.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.560
A man was seen near here

39:21.720 --> 39:24.040
last night wearing a mask.
And he was injured.

39:25.920 --> 39:28.080
And you connected
the dots all on your own?

39:28.080 --> 39:28.160
And you connected
the dots all on your own?
With the tiny brain
God gave you?

39:28.160 --> 39:29.960
With the tiny brain
God gave you?

39:30.080 --> 39:32.120
I asked you to respond politely.

39:32.840 --> 39:34.720
It was him. The killer.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.640
-How do you know?
-Because he came to kill me.

39:40.440 --> 39:41.440
What happened?

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
I'm still here.

39:44.800 --> 39:45.920
Did you attack him?

39:48.080 --> 39:50.120
-Where are you going with this?
-I want to know

39:50.240 --> 39:52.080
-if it was serious.
-No idea.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.720
Perhaps he tripped
and fell as he fled.

39:54.880 --> 39:56.080
Right.

39:56.920 --> 39:58.280
I've been very polite
and patient.

39:58.880 --> 40:02.080
I think we both have work to do.
And I just did yours for you.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.640
So, if you don't mind...

40:16.360 --> 40:17.480
Don't panic, girl.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.640
We'll study the equations
and you'll get it, you'll see.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.160
I don't know, I'm pretty dumb.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.520
Let me just check my mail.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.440
I spoke to Pili
from the other class

40:27.600 --> 40:30.440
and she already took the exam.
It's not so easy.

40:30.600 --> 40:33.880
And the teacher is crap,
how am I to learn anything?

40:34.000 --> 40:35.040
I have to do it all myself.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.000
-You're a drama queen.
-No, I'm not.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.360
I already failed Spanish.

40:38.480 --> 40:41.160
If I fail math too,
my mom will kill me.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.000
-What's this?
-Are you listening?

40:43.160 --> 40:44.800
Yes, hold on, I've got...

40:45.320 --> 40:48.200
"Congrats, you won two tickets
to Planet Sound Festival".

40:48.360 --> 40:51.280
-What? I can't believe it.
-Let's see.

40:51.440 --> 40:54.120
-Wait, this is unbelievable!
-They're for tonight.

40:54.320 --> 40:57.160
That's amazing, girl!
How lucky is that?

40:57.320 --> 40:59.560
-I can't believe it.
-It must be a fake.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.000
Fake?
I probably filled something out.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.440
I'm always filling out forms
to get free stuff.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.920
-So, it was a contest?
-I don't know, who cares?

41:07.040 --> 41:10.640
-We're going for free!
-For free! This is huge!

41:10.760 --> 41:11.880
Unreal.

41:12.760 --> 41:15.080
My God. What's up?

41:15.520 --> 41:17.160
What do I tell my grandma?

41:17.360 --> 41:19.840
Do you need permission
for every little thing?

41:20.280 --> 41:21.360
-No.
-Yes.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.280
Look, my parents
are out tonight.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.320
Tell her you're sleeping
at my place.

41:25.520 --> 41:26.560
What do you say?

41:27.000 --> 41:29.160
-What should we wear?
-I'm so excited! Run!

42:42.640 --> 42:43.640
Come on!

42:49.760 --> 42:51.960
You don't know
how excited I am for tonight.

42:52.680 --> 42:54.400
I'm like a kid on Christmas Eve.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.200
I want this to be over with too.

42:58.280 --> 43:00.040
We're in sync there, see?

43:03.560 --> 43:06.560
-Have I put you through a lot?
-You have.

43:07.720 --> 43:08.720
Oh, man.

43:09.320 --> 43:10.800
That wasn't my intention.

43:20.040 --> 43:22.120
This will all be worth it,
trust me.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.040
Nobody has ever done
anything for me.

43:28.440 --> 43:31.040
There are a lot of
unnecessary people out there.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.560
And I'm one of them.

43:39.920 --> 43:40.920
What do you see?

43:43.920 --> 43:44.920
Nothing, nobody.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.120
Well, I see someone essential.

44:03.400 --> 44:04.840
COMMISSIONER

44:05.000 --> 44:06.200
I want to speak to you.

44:08.680 --> 44:09.680
In private.

44:10.640 --> 44:14.080
This is an important meeting.
Whatever it is, it can wait.

44:15.480 --> 44:17.200
I decide what can wait.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.480
You're a proud man, Nieto.

44:39.080 --> 44:40.640
I guess you've come
to apologize.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.000
We said some nasty shit
the other day.

44:49.440 --> 44:51.360
The murderer's DNA.

44:53.840 --> 44:54.840
Excuse me?

44:55.400 --> 44:57.160
He went after
López de Haro last night.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.000
Then he holed up in a bar.

44:59.160 --> 45:01.360
He's injured.
A witness saw him leave.

45:02.600 --> 45:03.600
Shit.

45:04.560 --> 45:07.240
He could be hiding
anywhere right now, but there...

45:08.120 --> 45:09.800
we've got his identity.

48:08.360 --> 48:09.400
Yes?

48:13.120 --> 48:14.000
I'm freezing.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.000
You're either freezing
or roasting here, right?

48:19.640 --> 48:21.040
Is it part of the therapy?

48:21.520 --> 48:23.080
The heater's broken.

48:24.360 --> 48:25.480
Great.

48:26.880 --> 48:30.120
These surroundings, the storm,
all we need now is a werewolf.

48:30.280 --> 48:33.040
-It's good you can still laugh.
-Right.

48:33.160 --> 48:35.320
This is for you,
it just arrived.

48:50.160 --> 48:51.680
"Planet Sound Festival".
