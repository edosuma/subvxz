02:39.451 --> 02:41.081
Well, you're entitled
to your opinion.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.038
It has nothing to do
with the design.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.578

is actually going on

02:49.211 --> 02:50.921
o.
-No?

02:50.921 --> 02:54.381
If you reference
every single one of her looks,

02:54.383 --> 02:57.223
it has been a direct rip-off

02:57.219 --> 03:01.059
of stuff they have worn,
stuff that is in their closet.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.766

03:03.267 --> 03:04.267
TIM:
<i>If you wanted to,</i>

03:04.268 --> 03:05.598

03:05.602 --> 03:06.732
you're wearing in the room.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.808
MARGARITA:
Claire and Shawn told us one day

03:08.814 --> 03:10.774
that they measure their clothes.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.444
TIM: You-you have measuring
tapes at your workstations.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.743
It's one thing to measure;

03:14.736 --> 03:17.066
it's another thing
to completely re-redo...

03:17.072 --> 03:19.872
Knock off a garment
that you have in your closet.

03:19.867 --> 03:24.287
Somebody tell us
what is going on.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.247
So, there was a situation

03:27.249 --> 03:30.539
with Margarita's top in which...

03:30.544 --> 03:33.844
Claire had...

03:33.839 --> 03:36.339
Did they... did she think
that I knocked off her top

03:36.341 --> 03:38.761
-from the last challenge?
-(whispering): You did. You did.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.430
Is that what the whole issue is?

03:41.847 --> 03:43.257
I would have respected
the decision

03:43.265 --> 03:46.135
if Kentaro would have won,
because there is conviction

03:46.143 --> 03:47.643
in his design, and there is...

03:47.644 --> 03:48.984
-Originality.
-Originality.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.979
So you're saying
that-that Claire is a designer

03:50.981 --> 03:52.191
-you don't believe in.
-Yes.

03:52.191 --> 03:55.691
Well, there are people
who disagree.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.364
And they only see
one side of it,

03:57.362 --> 03:59.242
whereas we understand
what she is doing,

03:59.239 --> 04:01.619
and she knows
what she is doing as well.

04:01.617 --> 04:05.157
We should go out there and,
you know, let Tim sort it out.

04:05.162 --> 04:08.872
And, in addition,
she was measuring her own pants,

04:08.874 --> 04:11.294
-and so...
-CLAIRE: I literally took a pair

04:11.293 --> 04:13.713
of pants that I had,
measured them to a T,

04:13.712 --> 04:17.132
and then made the exact
same pant that I have.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.172
You rubbed off the pant.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.295
I referenced a pair of pants

04:19.301 --> 04:20.471
-that I had...
-Which is fine.

04:20.469 --> 04:21.798
-That's fine.
-...to compare.

04:21.803 --> 04:25.853
And you recreated the tank for
the "good and evil" challenge,

04:25.849 --> 04:27.479
and that's what bothers me,
and I didn't want

04:27.476 --> 04:30.646
to say anything,
because it's not my place.

04:30.646 --> 04:32.266

04:39.530 --> 04:40.860
-Um...
-How do we know that?

04:40.864 --> 04:43.204
I've seen it,

04:43.200 --> 04:45.200
She has mentioned it to me.

04:45.536 --> 04:46.696
Well, we will look into this.

04:46.703 --> 04:50.373
She writes down the measurements
either on a piece of paper

04:50.374 --> 04:53.214
or on her hand,
and comes back and...

04:53.210 --> 04:55.500

19:06.772 --> 19:08.562
-Yes!
-(quiet chatter)

19:08.565 --> 19:10.775
-Do you want to sit right here?
-Okay.

19:10.776 --> 19:12.236
These chairs are so tiny.

19:12.236 --> 19:14.196
This is gonna be
about Bubbleisha

19:14.196 --> 19:16.946
and you, so... what kind
of dresses do you like?

19:16.949 --> 19:19.079
My favorite things are, like,
bright colors,

19:19.076 --> 19:21.076
and I like her shoes.
Like, they have

19:21.078 --> 19:23.958
-pink bows on the back.
-Bows! Yes, yes, yes.

19:23.956 --> 19:25.496
<i>I essentially draw out a look,
and then</i>

19:25.499 --> 19:27.249
<i>I let Bella weigh in.
So she was like,</i>

19:27.251 --> 19:28.711
"Okay, I like this,
I like this."

19:28.710 --> 19:29.880
We'll do ruffly sleeves.

19:29.878 --> 19:31.918
Then we'll do
a really big bow in the back.

19:31.922 --> 19:35.262
As big as we can possibly get it
where she doesn't fall over.

19:35.259 --> 19:36.839
(both laugh)

19:37.094 --> 19:39.804
If I created a new Shopkin doll,

19:39.805 --> 19:41.555
what would you want her to wear?

19:41.557 --> 19:42.717
A sparkly dress.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.564
BATANI:
Sparkly dress.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.350
I have something here.

19:46.353 --> 19:49.113
She's going to open
her new art exhibit

19:49.106 --> 19:50.606
-in the art gallery...
-Mm-hmm.

19:50.607 --> 19:53.987
...and there's going to be
a costume party to celebrate.

19:53.986 --> 19:56.236
-So she's a painter, huh?
-Yeah.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.408
So she's going
to a disco dance party.

19:58.407 --> 20:00.117
(gasps)
Stop. I love it already.

20:00.117 --> 20:02.907
<i>Roxy pulled out a drawing
that she did.</i>

20:02.911 --> 20:03.951
<i>She has a jumpsuit.</i>

20:03.954 --> 20:07.164
<i>She has a disco-ball headband.</i>

20:07.165 --> 20:08.825
This is, like,
the best thing ever.

20:08.834 --> 20:11.504
What if we make it
almost like a disco ball?

20:11.503 --> 20:13.803
-Lots of glitter everywhere?
-Yeah.

20:13.797 --> 20:15.297
<i>The fact that a little kid is</i>

20:15.299 --> 20:16.589
really into disco is killer.

20:16.592 --> 20:18.592
VIRGINIA:
Our model is Cocolette

20:18.594 --> 20:19.764
-with chocolate, so...
-Yeah.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.141
I was thinking, like,
we could, like,

20:21.138 --> 20:22.428
stain chocolate into the clothes

20:22.431 --> 20:26.101
so it looks like... like
chocolate, like, dripping down.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.021
BRANDON:She wants me
to stand on chocolate

20:28.020 --> 20:30.610
and smush it in the dress
and drip chocolate everywhere

20:30.606 --> 20:34.026
and just make chocolate
and chocolate and chocolate...

20:34.026 --> 20:35.026
I love chocolate.

20:35.027 --> 20:36.987
(chuckling):
You love chocolate?

20:36.987 --> 20:40.157
Okay, so my ideas are that
she's going to a red carpet.

20:40.157 --> 20:43.987
Okay. -Because she's a boss
and she likes to boss around.

20:43.994 --> 20:46.504
(laughing):
I'm like, "Yes, ma'am."

20:46.496 --> 20:47.536
It needs to be fierce.

20:47.539 --> 20:49.119
(laughs)
You know what would be cool?

20:49.124 --> 20:50.964
How about if it went like this?

20:50.959 --> 20:52.289
-And what's that?
-A jacket.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.804
-That looks weird.
-You're not seeing the vision?

20:54.796 --> 20:57.296
o, I'm not. No.
-You're not seeing it? (laughs)

20:57.299 --> 20:58.719
These are erasable, too,
so that's

20:58.717 --> 21:00.637
kind of cool
about our pens here.

21:00.636 --> 21:02.886
<i>Pilot FriXion pens are</i>

21:02.888 --> 21:04.008
amazingly dope.

21:04.014 --> 21:05.934
-That's a pen?
-Right. I know, right?

21:05.933 --> 21:08.353
-Anywho, come on, girl.
-Okay. (laughs)

21:08.352 --> 21:12.982
Would you want to see, like,
big poofy sleeves kind of?

21:12.981 --> 21:16.611
Or maybe we could do, like,
medium skirt up to her knees.

21:16.610 --> 21:18.490
-Mm-hmm.
-And pour glitter glue,

21:18.487 --> 21:20.527
and then add more glitter
to the glue.

21:20.531 --> 21:22.871
<i>She wants it to be, like,
glitter, glitter, glitter,</i>

21:22.866 --> 21:24.576
and I'm like, "I love glitter!

21:24.576 --> 21:26.366
This is great!"
(chuckles)

21:26.370 --> 21:27.830
Glitter glam girl.

21:27.829 --> 21:30.749
I really like
that she has her headband.

21:30.749 --> 21:33.839
It has, like, shrimp and...

21:33.836 --> 21:36.046
-I just really like sushi.
-And cucumber, yeah.

21:36.046 --> 21:38.206
AMY:During my collaboration
with Violet,

21:38.215 --> 21:41.005
I'm propelled right back into
playing with my own daughter

21:41.009 --> 21:42.589
when she was six years old.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.054
<i>I miss my family terribly.</i>

21:44.054 --> 21:45.724
<i>My daughter is 16,
and she's doing</i>

21:45.722 --> 21:48.602
<i>so many things without me,
and I know she's missing me.</i>

21:48.600 --> 21:51.020
So, what do you think you want
to do when you grow up?

21:51.019 --> 21:54.399
Maybe I could be, like,
a ballerina.

21:54.398 --> 21:56.018
-Do you dance?
-I dance sometimes

21:56.024 --> 21:57.984
-when I'm alone.
-Yeah, for fun?

21:57.985 --> 22:00.025
<i>At this moment,
I don't even really care</i>

22:00.028 --> 22:01.198
<i>about making clothes.</i>

22:01.196 --> 22:02.446
I just want to play with her.

22:02.447 --> 22:06.697
All right, designers
and Shopkins superfans,

22:06.702 --> 22:08.582
let's head off.

22:10.622 --> 22:12.252
<i>Your time starts now.</i>

22:17.296 --> 22:18.876
-Can I get some help?
-AMY: <i>I'm feeling a little</i>

22:18.881 --> 22:21.301
behind the eight ball today,
mostly because

22:21.300 --> 22:22.760
<i>the time that I spent
in consultation,</i>

22:22.759 --> 22:24.299
<i>I just really spent
with hanging out</i>

22:24.303 --> 22:25.763
with Violet,
'cause that's just what

22:25.762 --> 22:27.102
made me happy at the moment.

22:27.097 --> 22:28.257
<i>What I'm gonna do</i>

22:28.265 --> 22:30.135
<i>with this fabric,
I have no idea.</i>

22:30.142 --> 22:32.642
She was just like, "Chocolate,
chocolate, chocolate."

22:32.644 --> 22:34.854
-I'm lost.
-You... you do

22:34.855 --> 22:36.805
what resonates for you,
and you take away

22:36.815 --> 22:38.895
from that session
whatever you want.

22:38.901 --> 22:40.111
-Thank you, Tim.
-Go big.

22:40.110 --> 22:41.650
KENTARO:
How about this one?

22:41.653 --> 22:43.283
Like a beautiful butterfly

22:43.280 --> 22:44.950
caught in the spiderweb.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.948
TIM:
Designers, 15 minutes.

22:51.121 --> 22:53.081
MICHAEL:I want to make
a really glittery jumpsuit,

22:53.081 --> 22:55.501
<i>and I think silver
is the safest way to go</i>

22:55.501 --> 22:59.751
to make sure that the garment
looks clean and not tacky.

23:01.673 --> 23:03.803
Designers,
you have five minutes.

23:04.635 --> 23:05.585
Swatchie!

23:05.594 --> 23:06.684
Yeah, let me get two. Two.

23:06.678 --> 23:08.598
<i>Kayley told me
she liked colors.</i>

23:08.597 --> 23:10.257
<i>I want something
with pops of color,</i>

23:10.265 --> 23:12.305
-so I got the blue.
-Two yards of this.

23:12.309 --> 23:14.519
<i>Then I saw the flowers,
and I got the flowers,</i>

23:14.520 --> 23:16.600
and it just started
all coming together.

23:16.605 --> 23:19.265
-Okay.
-All right, designers.

23:19.274 --> 23:20.694
Time is up.

23:20.692 --> 23:21.942
Thank you, Mood.

23:21.944 --> 23:23.324
DESIGNERS:
Thank you.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.360
Have a good night's nap, Swatch.

23:26.365 --> 23:28.735
(humming, sighing)

23:28.742 --> 23:30.662
Yes!

23:31.620 --> 23:35.120
KENYA:My little diva told me
that it has to be dramatic,

23:35.123 --> 23:38.843
<i>and she made sure that she'd
spell it out for me.</i>

23:38.836 --> 23:40.956
AMY:
Avant-on-your-garde!

23:40.963 --> 23:42.633
KENYA:
What are you doing, Amy?

23:42.631 --> 23:44.971
(chuckling):
Not sure.

23:44.967 --> 23:46.257
Amy's wheels are always turning.

23:46.260 --> 23:48.010
AMY: Just don't know
where my tracks are.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.721
I just had an idea
kicking around in my head.

23:49.721 --> 23:51.391
-I'm just gonna have to do it.
-MICHAEL: Margarita?

23:51.390 --> 23:53.720
You said you had to go down
on Meisha, right?

23:53.725 --> 23:55.475
Whoa! What are you saying?

23:55.477 --> 23:57.807
MICHAEL: You didn't do pants
on Meisha, did you?

23:57.813 --> 23:59.193
Uh, let me see your measurement.

23:59.189 --> 24:00.519
MICHAEL:
<i>I get to work</i>

24:00.524 --> 24:01.484
with Meisha this week,

24:01.483 --> 24:03.483
and I know I can kill this one.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.985
Make it work, make it work,
make it work.

24:05.988 --> 24:08.568
Why do they not have
a theme song by now

24:08.574 --> 24:09.874
that says "make it work"?

24:09.867 --> 24:11.657
♪ I have no time ♪

24:11.660 --> 24:14.370
♪ I have avant-garde to make ♪

24:14.371 --> 24:18.881
♪ This super sucks ♪

24:18.876 --> 24:20.706
♪ But Tim would always say ♪

24:20.711 --> 24:23.211
-♪ Make it work ♪
-KENTARO: ♪ Make it work ♪

24:23.213 --> 24:25.213
♪ Make it work. ♪

24:28.510 --> 24:30.850
I kind of wish
the eliminated designers

24:30.846 --> 24:32.006
would become our assistants.

24:32.014 --> 24:33.934
-Who would you like to abuse?
-Samantha.

24:33.932 --> 24:36.062
-(Michael laughs)
-AMY: We'd fight over her.

24:36.059 --> 24:37.889
I wouldn't want
the most recently

24:37.895 --> 24:39.845
eliminated designer
to come back.

24:39.855 --> 24:41.685
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:41.690 --> 24:43.400
<i>Since the twins left,</i>

24:43.400 --> 24:45.530
<i>this is like
a whole new place to work in.</i>

24:45.527 --> 24:46.897
<i>Everyone is light</i>

24:46.904 --> 24:48.404
and focused and...

24:48.405 --> 24:51.405
<i>-making jokes.
</i> -(laughter)

24:51.408 --> 24:52.408
<i>This is exactly</i>

24:52.409 --> 24:54.199
how it should be all the time.

24:54.203 --> 24:55.583
Hey.

24:55.579 --> 24:56.949
-Hi, Tim.
-How is everyone?

24:56.955 --> 24:59.115
Having fun. -You're having fun?
All right, well, that's good.

24:59.124 --> 25:00.924
All right, well, I'm here
to check in with you.

25:00.918 --> 25:04.708
Well, all I have to say is
thank goodness Batani is back.

25:04.713 --> 25:07.383
-Color, pattern, avant-garde.
-Thank you.

25:07.382 --> 25:08.422
-Hooray.
-Still here.

25:08.425 --> 25:10.585
<i>I just want to show the judges</i>

25:10.594 --> 25:12.644
that I can make
a comeback and...

25:12.638 --> 25:13.548
<i>I'm here to win.</i>

25:13.555 --> 25:15.715
Coming together
like a butterfly or insect.

25:15.724 --> 25:17.604
I'm going to have this
in the back

25:17.601 --> 25:19.981
and maybe something
hanging from it.

25:19.978 --> 25:21.228
Is this piece more
of an accessory,

25:21.230 --> 25:22.770
or is it actually built
into the garment?

25:22.773 --> 25:24.193
It's gonna be built
into the garment.

25:24.191 --> 25:25.901
TIM: I mean, you have
quite an elaborate

25:25.901 --> 25:27.491
-color story going on right now.
-Yeah, yeah.

25:27.486 --> 25:29.736
I just don't want this
to be a distraction,

25:29.738 --> 25:32.158
where our eye doesn't know
what to... where to go.

25:32.157 --> 25:34.117
Is it over here,
or is it down there?

25:34.117 --> 25:36.907
Use your gut, and get rid
of this thing. -(laughing)

25:36.912 --> 25:41.832
I'm gonna try to create feeling
instead of structural object.

25:41.834 --> 25:44.844
So I'm going to make a lot
of different parts now,

25:44.837 --> 25:47.917
and as soon as model comes,
I'm going to attach it...

25:47.923 --> 25:49.973
-You'll build it on her?
-Yeah.

25:49.967 --> 25:51.587
She kept saying,
"Glitter, glitter."

25:51.593 --> 25:55.143
Then I found this fabric,
so I stitched this packing foam

25:55.138 --> 25:58.978
under it so I can sculpt it
into voluminous shapes.

25:58.976 --> 26:02.306
That was a very smart idea.

26:02.604 --> 26:04.024
-Kenya.
-Hello.

26:04.022 --> 26:06.192
-How are you doing?
-I was thinking to do

26:06.191 --> 26:09.611
a strapless dress
and layers down the front,

26:09.611 --> 26:14.621
and then take the wire
and attach it to this.

26:14.616 --> 26:15.776
-Tendrils coming out.
-Yeah.

26:15.784 --> 26:18.874
'Cause you know
I'm just so extra, Tim.

26:18.871 --> 26:20.871
(both laughing)

26:20.873 --> 26:21.963
So, how is Ayana?

26:21.957 --> 26:23.497
-I'm kind of freaking out. Um...
-Okay.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.210
Talk to me. -The concept
is that it's gonna be,

26:26.211 --> 26:28.381
like, a short dress
with a lot of ruffles.

26:28.380 --> 26:31.300
Okay. -So, the ruffles
are gonna kind of shoot out.

26:31.300 --> 26:34.510
My plan is to use bows.
(laughs)

26:34.511 --> 26:35.511
They're gonna be huge.

26:35.512 --> 26:39.312
And then also
I have some of this.

26:39.308 --> 26:40.978
And I also have this.

26:40.976 --> 26:42.636
-Oh, dear.
-Yep.

26:42.644 --> 26:44.654
KENYA:
<i>Ayana has this fabric</i>

26:44.646 --> 26:47.566
<i>with polka dots on it
and-and yellow fabric.</i>

26:47.566 --> 26:49.526
I don't know what
this girl is doing.

26:49.526 --> 26:52.146
There are just so many details,
and I feel like

26:52.154 --> 26:55.414
-I don't have a ton of time.
-It's a lot.

26:55.407 --> 26:57.987
AYANA:My problem is that
I have too much going on.

26:57.993 --> 27:00.703
And the clock is ticking.
I'm getting very nervous.

27:00.704 --> 27:04.084
You need to start editing
right now.

27:04.082 --> 27:05.332
AYANA:
<i>I don't know.</i>

27:05.334 --> 27:07.464
<i>Like, I am struggling.</i>

27:07.461 --> 27:08.841
TIM:
If we had a week for this,

27:08.837 --> 27:12.417
I'd tell you the same thing--
get rid of those.

27:12.424 --> 27:14.884
Yeah.

27:19.348 --> 27:21.518
(horns honking)
<i>Coming</i>-TIM:You need to

27:21.517 --> 27:24.307
start editing right now.

27:25.687 --> 27:26.557
This has got to go.

27:26.563 --> 27:28.233
That pink metallic's got to go.

27:28.232 --> 27:31.032
Part of the direction here
was to

27:31.026 --> 27:33.776
take this point of origin
in a child's land

27:33.779 --> 27:35.239
but make it sophisticated,

27:35.239 --> 27:36.779
-make it fashion.
-Okay. Okay.

27:36.782 --> 27:38.072
And I love the tiers
and ruffles.

27:38.075 --> 27:41.405
I think that is the look.
But your challenge is to

27:41.411 --> 27:43.081
give this the volume
that it needs,

27:43.080 --> 27:45.250
or else it's just gonna
look wilted. -Okay.

27:45.249 --> 27:47.919
I mean, I think you've got
a really winning look. -Yay!

27:47.918 --> 27:50.168
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you, Ayana.

27:50.170 --> 27:51.090
How's Michael?

27:51.088 --> 27:52.758
-Hello.
-What's your design idea?

27:52.756 --> 27:55.216
Roxy told me that she wanted
to do a disco party,

27:55.217 --> 27:58.927
so what I built together
with her is a jumpsuit

27:58.929 --> 28:01.139
that is basically a disco ball

28:01.139 --> 28:03.219
kind of like melting
on the body.

28:03.225 --> 28:07.265
Will this be
the entire garment? -Yeah.

28:07.980 --> 28:12.070
You-you can't hide anything
with a look like this.

28:12.693 --> 28:14.403
KENYA:
<i>Michael, he's creating</i>

28:14.403 --> 28:16.283
<i>this jumpsuit, and I have</i>

28:16.280 --> 28:17.740
<i>o idea what he's doing.</i>

28:17.739 --> 28:19.159
<i>This is a lot of sequins.</i>

28:19.157 --> 28:20.117
<i>It doesn't look</i>

28:20.117 --> 28:21.577
like a winner at all.

28:21.577 --> 28:23.237
Just watch every detail.

28:23.245 --> 28:25.575
-It will be noticed. All right.
-Yeah.

28:25.581 --> 28:26.791
Carry on.

28:26.790 --> 28:29.250
Well, Amy, you've done a lot.

28:29.251 --> 28:31.131
AMY: Initially,
it was just gonna be a coat.

28:31.128 --> 28:32.628
Now I'm thinking
this could be a coatdress

28:32.629 --> 28:35.839
and that this could actually
be attached to this layer.

28:35.841 --> 28:37.761
Uh-huh. -And then I don't
really need an undergarment.

28:37.759 --> 28:40.509
And then I had a second layer,
and it had

28:40.512 --> 28:41.852
its own collar
that came over that.

28:41.847 --> 28:45.517
Well, it just looks like a
mishmash of two different looks.

28:45.517 --> 28:49.227
If you were to photograph her
just from the hips up,

28:49.229 --> 28:50.309
what a knockout.

28:50.314 --> 28:51.654
What about the hips down,
though?

28:51.648 --> 28:52.978
(laughing):
What'll we do with that?

28:52.983 --> 28:54.323
Well, it's-it's not so pleasing.

28:54.318 --> 28:57.698
MICHAEL: <i>Amy's design obviously
looks very avant-garde,</i>

28:57.696 --> 28:59.066
<i>but it also looks</i>

28:59.072 --> 29:00.622
like dated avant-garde.

29:00.616 --> 29:02.576
<i>It's not really moving
anything forward.</i>

29:02.576 --> 29:05.616
TIM: That textile looks
like some cheap pantyhose.

29:05.621 --> 29:06.791
That is not helping it.

29:06.788 --> 29:10.288
Don't overthink.
Go, go, go, go.

29:10.292 --> 29:11.382
-Brandon.
-Hi, Tim.

29:11.376 --> 29:13.206
-Talk to me.
-Kind of like did this piece,

29:13.212 --> 29:17.262
but now I'm gonna try
and make it avant-garde.

29:18.342 --> 29:21.512
Why has this taken you so long?

29:21.512 --> 29:24.722
To be honest, I don't know.
(chuckles)

29:24.723 --> 29:25.973
I don't know.

29:25.974 --> 29:28.184
This challenge is difficult
for you, isn't it?

29:28.185 --> 29:28.975
Yeah, it is.

29:28.977 --> 29:30.477
Creating something avant-garde,

29:30.479 --> 29:32.979
you want to be out there,
it has to be kind of new,

29:32.981 --> 29:34.021
has to be an odd silhouette,

29:34.024 --> 29:35.324
<i>and so, given the challenge,</i>

29:35.317 --> 29:37.237
<i>I think this is, like,
really important</i>

29:37.236 --> 29:39.646
<i>to rise to this occasion.</i>

29:39.655 --> 29:40.815
It's a little nerve-wracking.

29:40.822 --> 29:42.322
TIM:
I mean, I would be inclined

29:42.324 --> 29:45.494
to look at this
as the internal piece

29:45.494 --> 29:46.954
and expand from it.

29:46.954 --> 29:49.504
Maybe I just do, like,
a bunch of pieces like this

29:49.498 --> 29:50.828
in different lengths,
different layers,

29:50.832 --> 29:52.502
and they all just...
just kind of, like,

29:52.501 --> 29:54.251
she's just wearing this all
on her shoulder.

29:54.253 --> 29:56.713
Yeah. -Okay. AMY:Brandon's
look is very Brandon.

29:56.713 --> 29:58.013
Making the same shapes
and kind of

29:58.006 --> 29:59.336
layer, layer,
layer, layer, layer.

29:59.341 --> 30:01.051
<i>My concern for him
is that, if the judges</i>

30:01.051 --> 30:03.181
<i>want something that's
a little more cleaned up,</i>

30:03.178 --> 30:04.678
Brandon could be in the bottom.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.430
All right, you have a lot
of work to do.

30:06.431 --> 30:07.721
-I do.
-I'm gonna let you do it.

30:07.724 --> 30:08.854
-Okay, Tim.
-All right.

30:08.851 --> 30:10.061
-Thank you, Brandon.
-Thank you.

30:10.060 --> 30:11.520
TIM:
All right, everyone.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.940
I am really excited
about what you're doing.

30:13.939 --> 30:15.569
I want you to know
that your models

30:15.566 --> 30:16.766
will be in, in 45 minutes.

30:16.775 --> 30:19.355
You have until
11:30 tonight, okay?

30:19.361 --> 30:20.571
Please use the Brother Sewing

30:20.571 --> 30:21.901
and Embroidery Studio
responsibly.

30:21.905 --> 30:24.025
And I will see you in the
morning. -Thank you so much.

30:24.032 --> 30:26.452
-Thank you, thank you.
-DESIGNERS: Thank you, Tim.

30:26.451 --> 30:28.411
See you tomorrow.

30:31.707 --> 30:33.077
Oh, my God.

30:33.083 --> 30:34.213
Time is flying.

30:34.209 --> 30:36.379
This is very dangerous.

30:36.378 --> 30:38.418
Don't try this at home, people.

30:38.422 --> 30:39.632
<i>Tim loves the idea</i>

30:39.631 --> 30:41.551
of the ruffle and the bows.

30:41.550 --> 30:43.890
<i>He's like, "If you can get
the volume in the ruffle,</i>

30:43.886 --> 30:45.636
<i>I think you have
a winning look."</i>

30:45.637 --> 30:46.547
Okay.

30:46.555 --> 30:48.845
<i>So, I feel like I can
manipulate the chicken wire,</i>

30:48.849 --> 30:51.889
<i>and as long as Liris
can kind of step into it,</i>

30:51.894 --> 30:52.644
then I'm golden.

30:52.644 --> 30:54.404
All I need now is a chicken.

30:54.396 --> 30:55.936
Maybe I could put Swatch
in there.

30:55.939 --> 31:00.739
BATANI: <i>I see Ayana working
on her chicken-wire top.</i>

31:00.736 --> 31:03.106
<i>Ugh. This is not good.</i>

31:04.239 --> 31:04.989
Hi!

31:04.990 --> 31:07.160
(designers and models murmuring)

31:07.159 --> 31:11.079
So maybe I'm going to have you
inside to cover yourself

31:11.079 --> 31:12.789
and kind of drape it.

31:12.789 --> 31:15.169
So I'll guide you that way...

31:15.167 --> 31:16.787
My model for this challenge
is Jazzmine.

31:16.793 --> 31:19.343
<i>She's about nine feet tall.
Has great shoulders.</i>

31:19.338 --> 31:22.758
<i>If I'm gonna sculpt something,
I mean, here's a good model</i>

31:22.758 --> 31:24.088
to sculpt something on.

31:24.092 --> 31:25.342
(singsongy):
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:25.344 --> 31:26.974
You are the perfect model
for this.

31:26.970 --> 31:30.310
'Cause imagine if it's,
like, in silver sequins,

31:30.307 --> 31:32.807
like, it's gonna be
over-the-top coolness.

31:32.809 --> 31:35.769
I think the look
is gonna be exciting.

31:35.771 --> 31:37.521
At first,
I-I don't see anything,

31:37.523 --> 31:38.983
'cause it's actually
see-through.

31:38.982 --> 31:40.192
Is it, like,
uncomfortably tight?

31:40.192 --> 31:41.902
-Let me know-- on the legs.
-No.

31:41.902 --> 31:42.942
o? Okay.
-No. Yeah.

31:42.945 --> 31:44.315
MEISHA:
<i>Until you actually</i>

31:44.321 --> 31:45.611
<i>see it on yourself,</i>

31:45.614 --> 31:47.284
<i>you don't know what to expect.</i>

31:47.282 --> 31:48.452
<i>Anything could happen.</i>

31:48.450 --> 31:50.620
So I think tomorrow

31:50.619 --> 31:51.699
<i>will be interesting.</i>

31:51.703 --> 31:54.503
I'll definitely take it in a lot
in the back.

31:54.498 --> 31:55.668
It's an avant-garde one.

31:55.666 --> 31:57.536
Um, you're not gonna
be able to move a ton.

31:57.543 --> 32:00.173
I just have to make sure
your breasts don't fall out.

32:00.170 --> 32:02.960
MONIQUE:
<i>I'm not actually sure where</i>

32:02.965 --> 32:04.505
Batani is going with the look.

32:04.508 --> 32:05.928
There's a lot of skin.

32:05.926 --> 32:07.966
<i>I'm okay with showing
a lot of skin.</i>

32:07.970 --> 32:10.640
<i>I don't know if the rest
of the world is okay, but,</i>

32:10.639 --> 32:13.139
you know, you're gonna
have to be okay now. (laughs)

32:13.141 --> 32:15.811
-All righty.
-Thank you so much.

32:15.811 --> 32:17.481
-Bye.
-Bye!

32:19.022 --> 32:20.572
(bleep)

32:20.566 --> 32:22.686
Piece of (bleep).

32:23.235 --> 32:24.855
AMY:
Looks pretty, Margarita.

32:24.862 --> 32:26.612
I decided to hand-sew.

32:27.698 --> 32:28.738
<i>Por qué?</i>

32:28.740 --> 32:31.410
She's about to be
so uncomfortable,

32:31.410 --> 32:32.370
and I feel awful.

32:32.369 --> 32:34.159
<i>I know that,
if I get the fit right,</i>

32:34.162 --> 32:37.212
<i>it will look perfect
in those sequins, but...</i>

32:37.207 --> 32:39.707
any minor slipup,
and you could go home.

32:39.710 --> 32:41.290
It's hot.

32:43.422 --> 32:44.712
Yes.

32:46.175 --> 32:47.875
KENYA:
Huh?

32:47.885 --> 32:49.215
What?

32:49.720 --> 32:52.390
-Salmon?
-Yeah, Santa Claus.

32:52.389 --> 32:55.389
Happy merry Christmas, Kenya!

32:55.392 --> 32:57.022
(laughter)

32:57.019 --> 33:00.479
MARGARITA:
Stop it. You're killing me.

33:04.902 --> 33:07.242
This is so damn ugly.

33:07.237 --> 33:08.947
KENTARO:
Let me wear the dress, Ayana!

33:08.947 --> 33:10.527
AYANA:
Jump in. Go for it.

33:10.532 --> 33:12.242
-(laughter)
-Go for it.

33:12.242 --> 33:14.582
-Boom, boom, boom, boom.
-So, ladies and gentlemen,

33:14.578 --> 33:17.038
if you want to get
good structure,

33:17.039 --> 33:18.749
don't get a hoop skirt.

33:18.749 --> 33:20.079
Just get chicken wire.

33:20.083 --> 33:22.083
KENTARO:
Brother, are you doing okay?

33:22.085 --> 33:23.245
BRANDON:
Brother, no!

33:23.253 --> 33:25.213
I just (bleep) up,
'cause I was... like, this

33:25.214 --> 33:26.924
is the center front,
this is the neck, but this

33:26.924 --> 33:28.934
is, like, the wrap-around part,
this is the side.

33:28.926 --> 33:31.386
KENTARO: You know,
why don't you just make a skirt?

33:31.386 --> 33:32.596
Like apron.

33:32.596 --> 33:35.256
Don't worry about it,
because just low apron.

33:35.265 --> 33:38.095
MICHAEL:I think it's gotten
to the point where Brandon

33:38.101 --> 33:41.901
<i>is using Kentaro a lot,
and I can tell that</i>

33:41.897 --> 33:43.397
Brandon's running out of ideas.

33:43.398 --> 33:44.568
<i>I fear that he might</i>

33:44.566 --> 33:45.896
<i>be in trouble with this one.</i>

33:45.901 --> 33:47.651
And just hang it from the body.

33:47.653 --> 33:49.073
BRANDON:
I don't know.

33:49.071 --> 33:51.821
-You don't know?
-(bleep) that.

33:51.823 --> 33:53.123
I'm feeling the pressure,
for sure.

33:53.116 --> 33:55.486
KENTARO: All right, everybody,
time to go home.

33:55.494 --> 33:57.414
(designers groaning)

33:58.956 --> 34:00.616
BRANDON:
Yeah, I could be in the bottom.

34:00.624 --> 34:02.794
-KENTARO: Everybody, let's go.
-BRANDON: <i>I mean...</i>

34:02.793 --> 34:05.293
it's a first for me
feeling this way.

34:07.464 --> 34:09.474
(laughter)

34:10.132 --> 34:11.973
It's a scary thing.

34:17.599 --> 34:18.978
H-♪ ♪:
<i>Coming</i>-(horn honking)unw

34:18.976 --> 34:23.096
MARGARITA (groaning):
Oh, God. So much to do.

34:23.105 --> 34:26.225
-So much to do, girl.
-So little time.

34:26.233 --> 34:27.612
All right, so in my sleep,

34:27.609 --> 34:29.688
I changed my mind
about this part.

34:29.695 --> 34:31.195
<i>Runway morning--</i>

34:31.196 --> 34:32.106
I am nervous.

34:32.114 --> 34:33.664
<i>At this part
of the competition,</i>

34:33.657 --> 34:34.777
<i>it's just not enough to be</i>

34:34.783 --> 34:37.953
<i>less than spectacular,
so I just have</i>

34:37.953 --> 34:40.623
to make things as finished
as possible.

34:40.621 --> 34:42.502
-Hi!
-Good morning, everyone.

34:42.498 --> 34:44.498
-How are you?
-Not good. -Nervous.

34:44.501 --> 34:47.801
-(laughs) -Nervous.
-TIM: Good to not good?

34:47.795 --> 34:48.956
Good to not good.

34:48.964 --> 34:50.464
-Struggling.
-All right, well,

34:50.465 --> 34:52.335
you have an hour
to send your models to

34:52.342 --> 34:54.092
the Avon Beauty Lab
and to our hair studio.

34:54.094 --> 34:56.603
If there were ever
a challenge for which

34:56.597 --> 34:58.507
you need to use
the JCPenney accessory wall

34:58.515 --> 35:00.465
very thoughtfully,
it's this one.

35:00.475 --> 35:02.975
-Okay, thank you, everyone.
-All right. -Thank you, Tim.

35:02.978 --> 35:04.808
And our models will be in
momentarily.

35:04.813 --> 35:06.653
Wait, did he say
when they're coming in?

35:06.648 --> 35:08.318
-Momentarily.
-Momentarily.

35:08.317 --> 35:09.687
Momentarily.

35:09.693 --> 35:11.493
-Hey!
-Hey.

35:11.486 --> 35:14.026
Boy, that was
seriously momentarily.

35:14.031 --> 35:15.451
(laughing):
How are you?

35:15.449 --> 35:16.949
BRANDON:
You can hang out.

35:16.950 --> 35:18.160
I've got a lot to finish,

35:18.160 --> 35:19.490
but we're gonna get there, okay?

35:19.494 --> 35:20.874
<i>I'm worried at the time.</i>

35:20.871 --> 35:22.371
Time is an issue.

35:22.372 --> 35:23.922
<i>I still have to make straps</i>

44:59.241 --> 45:01.371
This is what avant-garde's
all about.

45:01.368 --> 45:03.448
Yeah, I wrote down
"surrealist Bo Peep."

45:03.453 --> 45:05.293
-(laughs)
-You know, I think this was fun.

45:05.289 --> 45:06.999
I thought it was expressive.

45:06.999 --> 45:10.459
I love your play of scale
and proportion.

45:10.460 --> 45:11.840
The polka dots and the poof

45:11.837 --> 45:13.837
are just so weird
coming out from it.

45:13.839 --> 45:17.969
You took the surrealist quality
of a Shopkin

45:17.968 --> 45:19.428
to a really fun level.

45:19.428 --> 45:20.508
Wonderful work. Fun.

45:20.512 --> 45:22.972
I think my favorite part
of this outfit

45:22.973 --> 45:25.143
is really that oversized bow.

45:25.142 --> 45:27.272
There's something
very sophisticated

45:27.269 --> 45:30.149
but, at the same time,
very childlike.

45:30.147 --> 45:32.477
That was just the icing
on the cake.

45:32.482 --> 45:34.442
-Thank you.
-HEIDI: Michael.

45:34.443 --> 45:39.113
My Shopkins expert, Roxy, said
that she had a concept in mind

45:39.114 --> 45:40.364
which was very disco-themed.

45:40.365 --> 45:44.155
So I came up with the concept
of a disco ball melting

45:44.161 --> 45:45.701
and dragging away.

45:45.704 --> 45:47.124
NINA:
It looks great.

45:47.122 --> 45:49.962
She looks fantastic,
but more important

45:49.958 --> 45:52.838
than everything else--
it looks so well made.

45:52.836 --> 45:54.376
The volume in the exterior--

45:54.379 --> 45:56.629
it just makes it
a little more sci-fi.

45:56.632 --> 45:59.222
I definitely want
to go dancing in that look.

45:59.218 --> 46:02.008
And, with the structure
that you added,

46:02.012 --> 46:04.972
it looks really beautiful
on her shape.

46:04.973 --> 46:06.723
-Be the disco ball. Turn around.
-ZAC: Yeah, do it.

46:06.725 --> 46:09.635
HEIDI: Like a real disco ball.
Keeps going and going and going

46:09.645 --> 46:10.975
-and going and going.
-Toot-toot.

46:10.979 --> 46:12.269
-Beep-beep.
-I mean, it looks

46:12.272 --> 46:13.652
so good from every angle.

46:13.649 --> 46:15.189
It really is fantastic.

46:15.192 --> 46:18.192
I totally got this
liquid-melting quality.

46:18.195 --> 46:21.195
I love seeing this level
of imagination from you.

46:21.198 --> 46:23.658
This is exciting.
This is fresh. This is new.

46:23.659 --> 46:25.329
And it captures the imagination.

46:25.327 --> 46:27.497
And that's what fashion
at the end of the day--

46:27.496 --> 46:30.156
high fashion-- is really about.

46:30.916 --> 46:31.956
HEIDI:
Brandon.

46:31.959 --> 46:34.839
So, my little girl
had a Cocolette doll.

46:34.837 --> 46:37.167
She was like, "Chocolate,
chocolate, chocolate.

46:37.172 --> 46:38.552
"I just want chocolate.
Can we, like,

46:38.549 --> 46:40.719
drip chocolate on it and, like,
melt chocolate in it?"

46:40.717 --> 46:43.387
So hopefully I don't break
her heart when she sees this,

46:43.387 --> 46:45.177
but brown wasn't really speaking
to me tonight.

46:45.180 --> 46:46.680
I found this, like,
double-faced fabric,

46:46.682 --> 46:48.682
and I knew that I wanted
to place, like, this volume

46:48.684 --> 46:50.854
on the side of, like,
kind of a cuff.

46:50.853 --> 46:53.273
It came together,
but it was a struggle.

46:53.272 --> 46:54.312
I think it's really cool.

46:54.314 --> 46:56.524
I immediately got
the cuff rollup.

46:56.525 --> 46:59.395
I think you have
a really clear aesthetic.

46:59.403 --> 47:02.113
It's very sophisticated.

47:02.114 --> 47:04.074
I don't think this
is gonna be everybody's

47:04.074 --> 47:06.374
-cup of tea that sees this.
-Right.

47:06.368 --> 47:07.948
But I think it's
really great work.

47:07.953 --> 47:09.453
I think you should be
really proud,

47:09.454 --> 47:11.334
and I just want to see more
from you.

47:11.331 --> 47:14.251
I actually cook in an apron
that exact same color,

47:14.251 --> 47:15.881
so I definitely got

47:15.878 --> 47:18.798
the... the character
right away as well.

47:18.797 --> 47:22.427
I thought it was great.
I love this detail up here.

47:22.426 --> 47:23.926
I thought it was beautiful.

47:23.927 --> 47:27.217
I respect the fact
that you kept to your aesthetic.

47:27.222 --> 47:30.062
Obviously, we know you come
from a men's background.

47:30.058 --> 47:34.268
We understand your language
through your clothes.

47:34.271 --> 47:37.321
It's very, very apparent
that this was your look.

47:37.316 --> 47:39.476
-Good job.
-Thank you.

47:39.484 --> 47:40.574
HEIDI:
Batani.

47:40.569 --> 47:43.569
So, my Shopkins superfan,

47:43.572 --> 47:44.612
she loved the color blue.

47:44.615 --> 47:46.565
She loved ice cream cones
and flowers.

47:46.575 --> 47:48.445
And I just wanted

47:48.452 --> 47:51.452
to play on volume
and color, and...

47:51.455 --> 47:53.655
yeah, that's what
I got inspired by.

47:53.665 --> 47:56.125
I have to say,
I was not in love with this.

47:56.126 --> 47:58.746
It's kind of like a lot
of scraps sewn together.

47:58.754 --> 48:02.674
But then, when it comes off,
it really looks so unfinished

48:02.674 --> 48:05.134
that it doesn't look
intentional anymore.

48:05.135 --> 48:07.965
When you see it from all angles,
it's just, like,

48:07.971 --> 48:09.311
falling apart on her.

48:09.306 --> 48:10.846
Like that-- I don't understand.

48:10.849 --> 48:12.599
Is that shorts?
What are you giving her

48:12.601 --> 48:14.101
-under there?
-It's a little skirt. Yeah.

48:14.102 --> 48:16.272
Why did you decide
to leave that like that?

48:16.271 --> 48:18.481
Uh, I like the black showing.

48:18.482 --> 48:19.482
I don't know, Batani.

48:19.483 --> 48:22.033
It looks like
you ran out of time.

48:22.027 --> 48:23.317
And the problem with your outfit

48:23.320 --> 48:25.320
is that we don't understand

48:25.322 --> 48:27.532
whether it was really unfinished

48:27.533 --> 48:31.583
or that really was the effect
you wanted to create.

48:31.578 --> 48:33.328
o, I wanted the black to show.
-ZAC: Why?

48:33.330 --> 48:35.370
It looks like you forgot
something. -I just want to know

48:35.374 --> 48:37.674
what it is about that
graphicness... -Uh...

48:37.668 --> 48:40.838
I just didn't want to put
all the volume all over.

48:40.838 --> 48:43.168
Well, I'm not here
to redesign it,

48:43.173 --> 48:46.343
but there's something,
quite frankly,

48:46.343 --> 48:47.843
that's not working.

48:47.845 --> 48:49.715
You know, I-I wrote down
"laundry day."

48:49.721 --> 48:52.351
(laughs) -And then,
if you turn to the back?

48:52.349 --> 48:54.639
I'm sorry,
the cutout on the back,

48:54.643 --> 48:56.193
it's not the most flattering.

48:56.186 --> 48:59.186
-BATANI: Mm-hmm.
-KATE: I have to agree.

48:59.189 --> 49:00.569
You know,
there's an art to doing

49:00.566 --> 49:02.856
deconstructed construction,

49:02.860 --> 49:04.650
and it's not very polished.

49:04.653 --> 49:06.703
And leaving that black skirt,

49:06.697 --> 49:09.987
it doesn't look
intentional at all.

49:09.992 --> 49:10.912
HEIDI:
Amy.

49:10.909 --> 49:12.239
Uh, one of the things I got

49:12.244 --> 49:14.204
from talking to Violet--
she liked most

49:14.204 --> 49:15.504
that there were
little molded pieces

49:15.497 --> 49:18.167
that would snap
on and off the garment

49:18.166 --> 49:19.376
so that there was a garment,

49:19.376 --> 49:22.796
but then there were little
cool things that went with it.

49:22.796 --> 49:25.086
And that's kind of
what I was going for.

49:25.090 --> 49:27.550
I have to be honest,
I was not the biggest fan

49:27.551 --> 49:28.761
of this look today.

49:28.760 --> 49:30.010
Just because...

49:30.012 --> 49:31.852
of the comparison
to the other designers.

49:31.847 --> 49:33.257
-I see that. Yeah.
-And the other looks

49:33.265 --> 49:35.885
-that came down the runway.
-ZAC: I don't feel

49:35.893 --> 49:38.563
that it's that risky as a piece.

49:38.562 --> 49:43.272
And I don't feel like your
beautiful streamlined aesthetic

49:43.275 --> 49:44.355
came into the piece.

49:44.359 --> 49:47.699
And then, for me, the tube
leather dress underneath

49:47.696 --> 49:49.276
kind of fought the whole look.

49:49.281 --> 49:50.361
Can she turn to the side?

49:50.365 --> 49:52.405
I just wanted to see
what was happening.

49:52.409 --> 49:54.909
-Yeah.
-NINA: I understand that you're

49:54.912 --> 49:56.792
very streamlined as a designer,

49:56.788 --> 50:00.418
but I don't think that means
that you cannot be

50:00.417 --> 50:02.037
an avant-garde designer.

50:02.044 --> 50:06.264
It's really breaking the rules
or breaking the norm.

50:06.256 --> 50:08.756
And that's kind of what
I wanted to see from you.

50:08.759 --> 50:12.049
So this, sadly,
is not my favorite look.

50:12.054 --> 50:14.564
I was really excited
by the collar,

50:14.556 --> 50:15.716
like something very vampy

50:15.724 --> 50:17.434
was gonna come out of it,
and then

50:17.434 --> 50:19.104
I felt like the rest
of the silhouette

50:19.102 --> 50:20.232
just really didn't match that.

50:20.229 --> 50:21.439
HEIDI:
Yes, you played with

50:21.438 --> 50:26.898
some volume, like,
right here, but is it enough?

50:27.569 --> 50:28.609
Margarita.

50:28.612 --> 50:31.412
My Shopkins superfan, Isabela,

50:31.406 --> 50:34.236
was already envisioning
an Oscars dress,

50:34.243 --> 50:38.503
and she shares the same love
for sparkles as I do.

50:38.497 --> 50:40.787
I found this beaded fabric,

50:40.791 --> 50:44.841
and I just wanted to organically
come up with the silhouette.

50:44.837 --> 50:46.457
I love this look.

50:46.463 --> 50:48.303
It is beyond stunning.

50:48.298 --> 50:51.678
I mean, it was like a cloud
that just, like...

50:51.677 --> 50:52.717
shh, shh, shh...

50:52.719 --> 50:54.509
The shape is beautiful,
and it's crazy.

50:54.513 --> 50:56.513
Even though
there's so much fabric on her,

50:56.515 --> 50:59.975
it still looks
very flattering to her body.

50:59.977 --> 51:01.187
I loved this look.

51:01.186 --> 51:02.346
All the different textures

51:02.354 --> 51:05.444
were really put together in a
very flattering, beautiful way.

51:05.440 --> 51:08.320
Thank you. -ZAC: You can
feel the sensuality.

51:08.318 --> 51:09.778
You can feel emotion in it.

51:09.778 --> 51:13.608
And that's because you draped it
and you let the fabric speak.

51:13.615 --> 51:14.445
Well done.

51:14.449 --> 51:16.739
NINA:
I love the fact that you took

51:16.743 --> 51:19.203
different fabrics
with different textures

51:19.204 --> 51:23.884
and built this 360 explosion.

51:23.876 --> 51:26.376
-She looks very on point.
-Thank you.

51:26.378 --> 51:28.628
Okay, we've heard
what you had to say.

51:28.630 --> 51:30.840
We're going to take
a closer look at your designs,

51:30.841 --> 51:33.181
have a little chat,
and then I'll call you back

51:33.177 --> 51:35.677
onto the runway.
Thank you.

-Hi.

52:28.774 --> 52:31.364
It may be difficult
to scoot over.

52:31.360 --> 52:32.360
(laughter)

52:32.361 --> 52:33.651
We have a lot of volume today.

52:33.654 --> 52:34.864
So, should we start with Liris?

52:34.863 --> 52:36.663
-HEIDI: Yes.
-Wearing Ayana.

52:36.657 --> 52:37.367
Wow.

52:37.366 --> 52:39.076
You are loving this.

52:39.076 --> 52:40.536
-(laughing)
-I can tell.

52:40.536 --> 52:42.696
-Yes. Yes.
-She's like, "Yes."

52:42.704 --> 52:43.874
How cool.

52:43.872 --> 52:45.872
Oh, it's like a pillow.

52:45.874 --> 52:47.384
-(laughing)
-It's so nice.

52:47.376 --> 52:48.836
-It's all, like, really...
-ZAC: Yeah.

52:48.836 --> 52:50.036
It's really padded
and really nice.

52:50.045 --> 52:52.295
ZAC: You got the pillows
and the ruffled sheets.

52:52.297 --> 52:54.877
Right? -NINA: Oh,
and did you guys notice

52:54.883 --> 52:57.393
-the bow up in the hair?
-HEIDI: Yeah.

52:57.386 --> 52:59.716
-Bows, bows and bows.
-ZAC: It's great.

52:59.721 --> 53:00.891
But it works for this challenge.

53:00.889 --> 53:02.389
-I love this.
-Super effective.

53:02.391 --> 53:04.891
-Yeah. -Fun.
-Very dramatic.

53:04.893 --> 53:06.143
-Yeah.
-What an entrance.

53:06.144 --> 53:08.354
HEIDI: Definitely
a different side of Ayana.

53:08.355 --> 53:10.395
ZAC:
Yeah. It's a wow.

53:12.734 --> 53:14.074
And Meisha is wearing Michael.

53:14.069 --> 53:16.739
-ZAC: How cool.
-Yes. -Wow.

53:16.738 --> 53:18.738
-Oh, yes.
-After he explained the whole

53:18.740 --> 53:20.070
disco ball melting,

53:20.075 --> 53:23.735
it gave me even more of an
appreciation for this design.

53:23.745 --> 53:26.245
Because then I could really
see it happening,

53:26.248 --> 53:28.618
especially around the leg area.

53:28.625 --> 53:30.745
-That's great.
-NINA: Amazing. -ZAC: Amazing.

53:30.752 --> 53:33.052
-He did a beautiful job.
-ZAC: Beautiful.

53:33.046 --> 53:34.756
-Really fun.
-KATE: He really went for it

53:34.756 --> 53:37.716
and made a disco ball look chic.
That's hard to do.

53:37.718 --> 53:41.678
-ZAC: Sensual Tin Man.
-NINA: It's a futuristic peplum.

53:41.680 --> 53:43.640
-Yes.
-(Zac chuckles)

53:43.640 --> 53:46.180
I love this look.

53:48.562 --> 53:49.982
TIM:
Sian is wearing Margarita.

53:49.980 --> 53:53.190
-HEIDI: And I love this.
-Well, this textile she found

53:53.192 --> 53:55.072
is really special.

53:55.068 --> 53:56.438
-Yeah.
-ZAC: Wow. Cool.

53:56.445 --> 53:57.895
-This, she hand...
-NINA: Embroidered?

53:57.905 --> 53:59.605
Yeah, she put, like, tiny
little pieces. -TIM: Yes.

53:59.615 --> 54:01.275
ZAC: Yeah, just to
pick up the sparkle.

54:01.283 --> 54:02.583
Yeah, to pick it up.

54:02.576 --> 54:03.486
I mean, one day.

54:03.493 --> 54:04.543
It's just exciting to see.

54:04.536 --> 54:05.996
-HEIDI: I love this.
-NINA: It is very nice.

54:05.996 --> 54:08.116
Yeah. -The proportions
are good. -She did a good job.

54:08.123 --> 54:09.623
ZAC: And this is really
beautiful. -Yeah.

54:09.625 --> 54:11.825
Look at that.
I mean, just that on its own...

54:11.835 --> 54:14.795
It's beautiful. -...is really
nice, sensitive draping.

54:14.796 --> 54:17.626
-Mm-hmm. -Right.
-ZAC: Very nice.

54:19.843 --> 54:22.143
TIM:
And Sanita is wearing Brandon.

54:22.137 --> 54:24.807
-Very cool.
-So interesting.

54:24.806 --> 54:25.966
Can we see the back?

54:25.974 --> 54:27.524
-It's great.
-It's great.

54:27.518 --> 54:29.478
This, which feels
so streamlined,

54:29.478 --> 54:31.978
-and then that-- young.
-NINA: I love them. Yeah.

54:31.980 --> 54:33.860
NINA:
I love the excess of the straps.

54:33.857 --> 54:37.857
ZAC: I can see that spark
of something really brilliant,

54:37.861 --> 54:40.151
and I think that's exciting.

54:40.155 --> 54:42.275
I love this.
I-I love this detail.

54:42.282 --> 54:44.832
He had a vision
and was able to do it.

54:44.826 --> 54:46.156
-He took his aesthetic...
-Yes.

54:46.161 --> 54:47.451
...to an avant-garde place,

54:47.454 --> 54:50.584
-and I think that's important.
-Yeah. Yes.

54:52.835 --> 54:54.995
TIM:
And Monique is wearing Batani.

54:55.003 --> 54:57.003
HEIDI:
This, to me, is terrible.

54:57.005 --> 54:58.835
Already we send her away.

54:58.841 --> 55:01.681
Here she is back again,
and then you do that?

55:01.677 --> 55:04.007
KATE: I like the fabric
she used. -HEIDI: Yeah.

55:04.012 --> 55:06.512
I like the floral,
I like that blue,

55:06.515 --> 55:07.845
and then it just wasn't done.

55:07.850 --> 55:09.600
TIM:
But she certainly is confident.

55:09.601 --> 55:11.021
-ZAC: Very. -Yeah.
-HEIDI: If this would have

55:11.019 --> 55:12.599
stayed on, I would have
been okay with it.

55:12.604 --> 55:15.694
She should have put that at the
bottom and made an actual skirt.

55:15.691 --> 55:17.691
No, I mean,
we're not here to redesign.

55:17.693 --> 55:19.863
o, but it's like... No.
-But that's not hard.

55:19.862 --> 55:22.152
HEIDI: I mean, it's a bunch
of scraps attached.

55:22.155 --> 55:23.605
-Come on.
-HEIDI: It's not nice.

55:23.615 --> 55:25.275
-It looks like an accident.
-Yeah.

55:25.284 --> 55:28.914
It doesn't look purposeful.
It looks like an accident.

55:31.164 --> 55:33.374
TIM:
And Jazzmine is wearing Amy,

55:33.375 --> 55:35.705
who also struggled profoundly.

55:35.711 --> 55:36.881
Yeah, you can tell.

55:36.879 --> 55:38.749
Amy's was really
uninspired, too.

55:38.755 --> 55:40.505
Like, this is what she sent
down the runway,

55:40.507 --> 55:43.337
-and it's just boring.
-KATE: I was so excited by this.

55:43.343 --> 55:45.553
I thought it was gonna be
so vampy,

55:45.554 --> 55:48.064
with your lip,
and then nothing else happened.

55:48.056 --> 55:50.766
She gave us a jacket
with no dress to go with it.

55:50.767 --> 55:54.897
ZAC: Maybe Amy's not a
one-day-challenge kind of gal.

55:54.897 --> 55:58.687
HEIDI: It's just not wow enough
next to all the others.

55:58.692 --> 56:00.112
ZAC: It's not polished.
It's not wow.

56:00.110 --> 56:04.410
It's drab. I wrote "very sad
and depressing."

56:04.406 --> 56:06.366
Whoosh.

56:07.576 --> 56:11.076
Amy and Batani are just not up
to the same standards here.

56:11.079 --> 56:14.209
For me, it's now refinement time
for Fashion Week.

56:14.208 --> 56:18.088
We got to really start to focus.
We're getting close.

56:18.086 --> 56:20.546
Okay, so we made our decision?

56:22.174 --> 56:26.644
Let's bring them back out.

56:26.637 --> 56:29.137
Designers, one of you
will be named the winner,

56:29.139 --> 56:32.479
and one or more of you
will be out.

56:32.935 --> 56:34.015
Michael, congratulations.

56:34.019 --> 56:36.019
You are the winner
of this challenge.

56:36.021 --> 56:36.851
Thank you.

56:36.855 --> 56:40.605
HEIDI: And Shopkins will create
a one-of-a-kind Shoppie

56:40.609 --> 56:42.279
<i>inspired by your design.</i>

56:42.277 --> 56:45.107
-Isn't that exciting?
-Yeah. Thank you.

56:45.113 --> 56:47.453
And, on top of it,
you win $5,000.

56:47.449 --> 56:48.619
Thank you.

56:48.617 --> 56:50.327
It really means a lot that you

56:50.327 --> 56:52.197
saw what I wanted to do.

56:52.204 --> 56:54.914
You're in.
You can leave the runway.

56:55.290 --> 56:57.920
MICHAEL:
<i>Winning this challenge</i>

56:57.918 --> 56:59.038
comes as a huge surprise,

56:59.044 --> 57:01.504
<i>because I didn't expect
the judges</i>

57:01.505 --> 57:05.625
<i>to respond to it
in the way that they did.</i>

57:05.634 --> 57:07.684
Oh! Did you win?

57:07.678 --> 57:09.468
-Yes.
-Serious?

57:09.471 --> 57:11.471
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

57:11.473 --> 57:13.143
MICHAEL:
<i>The fact that they</i>

57:13.141 --> 57:15.691
see that there's a level
of weirdness in my work

57:15.686 --> 57:19.146
<i>and I can still make it
really beautiful is exactly</i>

57:19.147 --> 57:20.817
what I came here to do.

57:20.816 --> 57:22.316
Yay, roomie!

57:22.317 --> 57:24.067
(Kenya laughing)

57:24.069 --> 57:27.489
HEIDI:
Ayana, Margarita, Brandon,

57:27.489 --> 57:29.699
you're all in.
You can leave the runway.

57:29.700 --> 57:31.200
Thank you.

57:37.207 --> 57:38.537
Batani.

57:43.672 --> 57:45.722
I'm sorry. You're out.

57:45.716 --> 57:47.626
All right.

57:48.093 --> 57:50.143
-ZAC: Bye.
-NINA: Bye again.

57:50.137 --> 57:52.387
Again,<i>auf Wiedersehen.</i>

57:53.182 --> 57:54.642
Bye.

57:55.184 --> 57:56.604
BATANI:
<i>I actually really liked</i>

57:56.602 --> 58:00.062
<i>my design for this runway,
but I know everybody</i>

58:00.063 --> 58:01.863
has their own opinion
about what they like

58:01.857 --> 58:03.107
or what they don't like.

58:03.108 --> 58:05.068
KENYA:
Yes? No?

58:05.068 --> 58:08.698
I'm going home again.
This time, for real. -Oh.

58:08.697 --> 58:10.567
I don't think I deserve
to go home,

58:10.574 --> 58:12.074
but if they want to send me home

58:12.075 --> 58:13.865
based on their opinion,
that's fine.

58:13.869 --> 58:16.829
You know we love you.

58:17.539 --> 58:18.829
Amy.

58:21.001 --> 58:23.171
I'm sorry.
You're out as well.

58:23.170 --> 58:24.920
Oh.

58:27.007 --> 58:29.177
(sighs)
So it goes.

58:29.176 --> 58:31.086
It was nice to meet you all.
<i>-Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

58:31.094 --> 58:33.554
-All the best to you.
-Thank you.

58:34.264 --> 58:35.724
AMY:
<i>Especially for this challenge,</i>

58:35.724 --> 58:37.774
<i>I didn't get as brave
as the rest of</i>

58:37.768 --> 58:39.478
the designers in this room.

58:39.478 --> 58:41.018
<i>So I get it.</i>

58:41.021 --> 58:43.231
It was just a surprise.

58:43.815 --> 58:46.105
-I'm going, too.
-AYANA: No.

58:46.109 --> 58:47.989
-What? -She's lying.
-Yeah, both of us.

58:47.986 --> 58:49.236
Two people are going home?

58:49.238 --> 58:50.608
-AMY: That's right.
-Are you serious?

58:50.614 --> 58:53.074
-You're kidding.
-Are you joking, Amy?

58:53.075 --> 58:56.155
KENYA:
They did a double whammy on us.

58:56.161 --> 58:58.161
It's like, in this game,
you just never know.

58:58.163 --> 59:01.083
Nobody's safe.
Nobody is off limits.

59:01.083 --> 59:02.583
You never know what will happen.

59:02.584 --> 59:05.294
I hate to be emotional.
Just kind of like, you know...

59:05.295 --> 59:06.495
No, it's shocking,
and I, like...

59:06.505 --> 59:09.915
Exhausting and surprised
more than anything else.

59:09.925 --> 59:11.125
Returning to
the designers' lounge

59:11.134 --> 59:12.434
<i>and seeing everybody else,</i>

59:12.427 --> 59:14.007
<i>I know that there's a lot of</i>

59:14.012 --> 59:15.812
<i>affection and respect</i>

59:15.806 --> 59:16.926
for me there

59:16.932 --> 59:19.642
that I think
I've definitely earned.

59:19.643 --> 59:20.773
<i>And that's touching.</i>

59:20.769 --> 59:21.979
<i>So feeling that--</i>

59:21.979 --> 59:23.689
yeah, that's gratifying.

59:23.689 --> 59:27.479
<i>Because you get so close
to these people.</i>

59:28.902 --> 59:31.362
(sighs)
Just like my students.

59:31.363 --> 59:33.453
(sighs, sniffles)

59:36.618 --> 59:38.118
Tim, what's happening?

59:38.120 --> 59:40.960
This is a point where this
is like the Olympics

59:40.956 --> 59:44.036
and someone is going to lose--
or two people will--

59:44.042 --> 59:46.172
by mere hairs of a second.

59:46.170 --> 59:48.800
Well, I have to send you
and, Batani, you

59:48.797 --> 59:50.967
to the workroom
to clean up your spaces.

59:50.966 --> 59:52.336
-All right.
-Okay?

59:52.342 --> 59:55.142
It's been a great experience
here at <i>Project Runway.</i>

59:55.137 --> 59:56.677
<i>Meeting wonderful people.</i>

59:56.680 --> 59:57.930
-TIM: Bye.
-Bye, guys.

59:57.931 --> 01:00:01.391
BATANI:
<i>It's just been surreal, so...</i>

01:00:01.393 --> 01:00:02.643
what more can you ask for?

01:00:02.644 --> 01:00:04.654
AMY:This experience
has opened up my mind

01:00:04.646 --> 01:00:06.146
<i>in a lot of ways,
which is really</i>

01:00:06.148 --> 01:00:08.478
what I was hoping for
coming to <i>Project Runway</i>

01:00:08.483 --> 01:00:09.573
more than anything else.

01:00:09.568 --> 01:00:13.238
<i>So I leave feeling
rejuvenating.</i>

01:00:13.238 --> 01:00:15.068
I leave feeling uplifted.

01:00:15.073 --> 01:00:18.913
<i>I understand myself again
as a creative person.</i>

01:00:18.911 --> 01:00:21.541
So this will be
influential to me

01:00:21.538 --> 01:00:25.248
in ways maybe I don't even
understand yet.

It was just moving beautifully.
