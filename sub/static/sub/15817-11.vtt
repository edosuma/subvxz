WELL, I HAVEN'T HAD A CRUSH

00:20.667 --> 00:21.733

00:21.733 --> 00:24.467
HE FINALLY ASKED ME OUT.

00:24.467 --> 00:25.700
I MET WITH YOUR PROBATION

00:25.700 --> 00:27.333
OFFICER THIS MORNING, AND SHE

00:27.333 --> 00:29.067
WENT DOWN AND APPLIED FOR A

00:29.067 --> 00:30.867
WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST.

00:30.867 --> 00:34.200
I HAD NO REASON TO HIT YOU.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.300
NO REASON AT ALL.

00:35.300 --> 00:36.233
I COULD HAVE TALKED THAT OUT

00:36.233 --> 00:37.600
BETTER.

00:37.600 --> 00:42.067
MIMI, SAY SOMETHING.

00:42.067 --> 00:42.900

02:04.767 --> 02:05.700
SO I'M HERE AT BENZINO'S

02:05.700 --> 02:07.100
HOUSE TO BLOW OFF SOME STEAM AND

02:07.100 --> 02:08.367
GET SOME CLARITY ON WHAT'S

02:08.367 --> 02:09.533
REALLY GOING ON.

02:09.533 --> 02:10.800
SHOT A VIDEO.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.067
HER AND DEB.

02:12.067 --> 02:13.500
I THOUGHT YOU SAID SHE WAS--

02:13.500 --> 02:14.767
SHE'S PREGNANT.

02:14.767 --> 02:15.600
THIS IS MY PROBLEM.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.867
I'M LIKE, "YOU KNOW, WHAT ARE

02:16.867 --> 02:17.567
YOU DOING?"

02:17.567 --> 02:18.833
AND DEB EVEN WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I

02:18.833 --> 02:20.233
TOLD HER TO SHOOT THE VIDEO, BUT

02:20.233 --> 02:21.333
I KIND OF AGREED IT'S

02:21.333 --> 02:22.400
INAPPROPRIATE WITH THE LOOK

02:22.400 --> 02:23.367
RIGHT NOW.

02:23.367 --> 02:25.433
"YOU AT A POINT WHERE YOU DOIN'

02:25.433 --> 02:26.600
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.267

02:28.267 --> 02:29.633

02:29.633 --> 02:31.333
IS IT A JOINT ACCOUNT?

02:31.333 --> 02:32.400
DEFINITELY A JOINT ACCOUNT.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.267
WELL, THEN, I MEAN...

02:33.267 --> 02:34.233
I'VE ALREADY TOLD HER, "YOUR

02:34.233 --> 02:36.100
NAME IS COMING OFF, PERIOD."

02:36.100 --> 02:37.500
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.267
THEN I'M LIKE--

02:38.267 --> 02:39.500
SO YOU'RE DECLARING WAR RIGHT

02:39.500 --> 02:40.200
NOW?

02:40.200 --> 02:41.167

02:41.167 --> 02:42.733
JUST POINTED 'EM RIGHT AT

02:42.733 --> 02:44.400
RASHEEDA.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.500
I MEAN, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL

02:45.500 --> 02:46.967
IF YOU WAKE UP, AND 20 GRAND IS

02:46.967 --> 02:47.967
JUST GONE?

02:47.967 --> 02:49.067
WHEN YOU STARTIN' CUTTIN' OFF

02:49.067 --> 02:51.533
ACCOUNTS, ESPECIALLY CHICKS WITH

02:51.533 --> 02:53.067
HABITS, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M

02:53.067 --> 02:54.067
SAYING?

02:54.067 --> 02:55.200
SNAKESKIN AND LEATHER HABITS,

02:55.200 --> 02:56.533
IT'S A WRAP, MAN,

02:56.533 --> 02:57.333
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

02:57.333 --> 02:58.933
MY THING IS, JUST ASK ME.

02:58.933 --> 02:59.800
JUST TELL ME.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.733
DON'T JUST TAKE SOMETHING LIKE

03:00.733 --> 03:01.400
THAT.

03:01.400 --> 03:02.200
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A MUTUAL

03:02.200 --> 03:02.933
AGREEMENT, OR COURSE, ESPECIALLY

03:02.933 --> 03:03.600
IF IT'S JOINT.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.267
YEAH.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.500
I'M GONNA AGREE WITH THAT.

03:05.500 --> 03:06.967
YOU KNOW, IF YOU GUYS CAN'T COME

03:06.967 --> 03:08.867
TO SOME AGREEMENT, THEN MAYBE

03:08.867 --> 03:10.867
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO STEP OFF A

03:10.867 --> 03:11.933
LITTLE BIT.

03:11.933 --> 03:13.233
IT BREAKS MY HEART TO SEE A

03:13.233 --> 03:14.300
POWER COUPLE LIKE KIRK AND

03:14.300 --> 03:17.167
RASHEEDA ON THE VERGE OF TOTALLY

03:17.167 --> 03:18.100
FALLING APART.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.700
I STILL GOT FAITH IN THESE TWO.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.967
KIRK CLEARLY NEEDS TO GET HIS

03:20.967 --> 03:21.667
MIND RIGHT.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.633
THE HOMEY NEEDS SOME SPACE.

03:23.633 --> 03:24.600
I GOT THE BIKE.

03:24.600 --> 03:26.067
YOU GOT A BIKE.

03:26.067 --> 03:26.867
LET'S GO TO THE LAKE.

03:26.867 --> 03:28.133
LET'S GET AWAY FROM THE STRIP

03:28.133 --> 03:30.567
CLUBS, THE CITY, THE MADNESS.

03:30.567 --> 03:32.367
RIDE UP THERE, YOU KNOW WHAT

03:32.367 --> 03:33.067
I'M SAYING?

03:33.067 --> 03:35.167
SIT BACK, JUST FISH JUMPIN'.

03:35.167 --> 03:36.567
IT'S ALL GOOD STUFF, MAN.

03:36.567 --> 03:37.500
WE GOT TO DO THAT.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.267
GET US AWAY FROM YOU THINKING

03:39.267 --> 03:41.067
ABOUT RASHEEDA AND FROM ME

03:41.067 --> 03:42.567
FEELIN' SORRY FOR MYSELF BECAUSE

03:42.567 --> 03:44.567
I SEEM TO CAN'T FIND NOBODY OUT

03:44.567 --> 03:45.767
HERE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.100
RASHEEDA DID SAY, "GO HOP ON

03:47.100 --> 03:48.467
YOUR BIKE AND FIND WHATEVER THE

03:48.467 --> 03:49.867
HELL YOU LOOKING FOR," SO...

03:49.867 --> 03:50.633
[laughs]

03:50.633 --> 03:51.300
I'M OUT.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.100
I'LL BE THERE. LET'S DO IT.

03:52.100 --> 03:52.867
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S GO

03:52.867 --> 03:53.667
THEN.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.533
I GOT TO FIND SOMEBODY TO WATCH

03:54.533 --> 03:55.533
CHLOE.

03:55.533 --> 03:57.867
TOAST.

03:57.867 --> 03:59.867
TO MAN TIME.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.933
HEY.

04:10.933 --> 04:11.700
HOW YOU DOING?

04:11.700 --> 04:13.067
I LOVE MIMI, SO I DECIDED TO

04:13.067 --> 04:15.500
PUT MY OPINION ASIDE BECAUSE I

04:15.500 --> 04:16.967
DON'T WANT TO BE FIGHTING WITH

04:16.967 --> 04:18.233
SOMEBODY I LOVE.

04:18.233 --> 04:19.133
SO WE COULD SIT DOWN AND TALK

04:19.133 --> 04:20.300
LIKE GROWN WOMEN.

04:20.300 --> 04:21.400
ME AND MIMI'S FRIENDSHIP IS WAY

04:21.400 --> 04:23.733
BIGGER THAN THAT LITTLE ARGUMENT

04:23.733 --> 04:26.100
WE HAD, AND I WANT US TO GET

04:26.100 --> 04:26.867
PAST IT.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.167
EVERYBODY KNOW I LOVE YOU.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.333
LIKE, I THINK YOU KNOW THAT.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.233
AND I LOVE MY FRIENDS SO HARD,

04:31.233 --> 04:32.567
LIKE I LOVE MY FAMILY.

04:32.567 --> 04:34.267
AND WHEN I SEE SOMETHING THAT I

04:34.267 --> 04:36.533
DON'T LIKE, I BE LIKE, "GRAH!"

04:36.533 --> 04:38.333
IT'S LIKE A BULLDOG, LIKE,

04:38.333 --> 04:40.300
ATTACKING SOMEBODY FOR THEY

04:40.300 --> 04:42.100
OWNER 'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE I BEEN

04:42.100 --> 04:43.933
THROUGH SOME OF THAT BEFORE.

04:43.933 --> 04:45.100
BUT I TRY TO HANDLE IT BETTER,

04:45.100 --> 04:46.467
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'?

04:46.467 --> 04:47.700
I'LL CALL YOU ON THE PHONE.

04:47.700 --> 04:48.900
SO THE LAST TIME WE SAW EACH

04:48.900 --> 04:50.067
OTHER WAS AT THE CHURCH.

04:50.067 --> 04:50.967
MM-HMM.

04:50.967 --> 04:52.133
I HEARD EVERYTHING YOU SAID.

04:52.133 --> 04:53.067
I DID.

04:53.067 --> 04:56.067
I JUST WAS NOT AT A PLACE TO

04:56.067 --> 04:56.900
TALK.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.100
I WASN'T EXPECTING FOR YOU TO

04:58.100 --> 04:59.600
BE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, I LOVE

04:59.600 --> 05:00.433
YOU!

05:00.433 --> 05:01.667
I WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND!"

05:01.667 --> 05:03.500
I WAS JUST HAPPY THAT I WAS ABLE

05:03.500 --> 05:05.100
TO GET IT OUT AND JUST REALLY

05:05.100 --> 05:07.167
SAY HOW I FELT ABOUT IT.

05:07.167 --> 05:08.867
'CAUSE I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT.

05:08.867 --> 05:10.500
AND HONESTLY, IT WAS NOT MY

05:10.500 --> 05:11.867
INTENT TO COME TO YOUR SHOW AND

05:11.867 --> 05:12.900
HAVE THAT CONVERSATION.

05:12.900 --> 05:13.733
OKAY.

05:13.733 --> 05:14.967
THINGS JUST--

05:14.967 --> 05:16.067
IT JUST--I THINK ON BOTH

05:16.067 --> 05:17.600
PARTS, IT JUST WASN'T THE TIME.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.700
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M REAL PISSED

05:18.700 --> 05:19.800
AT THE GIRL ABOUT NOT HAVING NO

05:19.800 --> 05:20.633
MAN.

05:20.633 --> 05:22.467
YOU KNOW I GET SENSITIVE.

05:22.467 --> 05:23.500
YOU SAID THAT, I WAS LIKE,

05:23.500 --> 05:24.367
[gasps].

05:24.367 --> 05:25.233
[laughs]

05:25.233 --> 05:26.767
SO I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?

05:26.767 --> 05:27.900
SHE KNOW ABOUT HER

05:27.900 --> 05:29.300
STRUGGLING WITH A BROKE HOT

05:29.300 --> 05:30.600
POCKET."

05:30.600 --> 05:31.700
I THINK IT'S AMAZING THAT

05:31.700 --> 05:32.800
K.MICHELLE AND I ARE ABLE TO DO

05:32.800 --> 05:33.900
THIS.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.733
THE K. THAT I KNOW WHEN WE SPEND

05:35.733 --> 05:36.867
TIME TOGETHER AND WE'RE COOL AND

05:36.867 --> 05:38.933
SHE'S BEING JUST A COOL-ASS

05:38.933 --> 05:40.067
BITCH?

05:40.067 --> 05:40.967
I LOVE HER.

05:40.967 --> 05:42.833
BUT THAT OTHER PERSON NEEDS SOME

05:42.833 --> 05:43.867
WORK.

05:43.867 --> 05:46.067
YOU'VE GOT TO LET ME GO

05:46.067 --> 05:47.067
THROUGH MY STRUGGLE, WHATEVER IT

05:47.067 --> 05:47.700
MAY BE.

05:47.700 --> 05:48.600
NOW THAT'S GONNA BE HARD.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.933
I'M NOT BLIND.

05:49.933 --> 05:50.833
I'M NOT STUPID.

05:50.833 --> 05:53.067
I SEE REAL CLEAR WHAT IT IS.

05:53.067 --> 05:53.900
YEAH, BUT I HATE IT.

05:53.900 --> 05:54.667
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE HURT NO

05:54.667 --> 05:56.367
MORE.

05:56.367 --> 05:59.300
SO WHERE IS MY BEST FRIEND?

05:59.300 --> 06:00.533
OKAY, I'M BLIND.

06:00.533 --> 06:02.400
[laughter]

06:02.400 --> 06:03.233
KNOW YOU'RE BLIND, GIRL.

06:03.233 --> 06:03.900
WHERE IS NIKKO?

06:03.900 --> 06:04.633
I'M BLIND, GIRL.

06:04.633 --> 06:05.767
WHERE IS NIKKO?

06:05.767 --> 06:07.733
I HAD TO PUT NIKKO ON ICE.

06:07.733 --> 06:09.700
OH, I'M...

06:09.700 --> 06:10.933
HE SAID SOME STUPID [bleep],

06:10.933 --> 06:12.067
DID SOME STUPID [bleep].

06:12.067 --> 06:13.067
LIKE, IT WAS JUST--

06:13.067 --> 06:13.867
LIKE A MAN.

06:59.867 --> 07:01.067
SHAY WALKED IN THE DOOR, YOU

07:01.067 --> 07:02.067
COULD FEEL THE TENSION, AND AS

07:02.067 --> 07:04.433
SOON AS ERICA OPENED HER MOUTH,

07:04.433 --> 07:06.067
SHAY WENT CRAZY.

07:06.067 --> 07:08.067
I GOT CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE, AND

07:08.067 --> 07:09.600
I'M NOT TRYIN' TO DO ALL THAT.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.767

07:11.767 --> 07:13.267
A WHOLE NEW LIGHT.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.333
SHAY AND I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FOR

07:14.333 --> 07:16.067
A LONG TIME, BUT THIS IS TOO

07:16.067 --> 07:16.967

07:16.967 --> 07:18.367
I NEED MY FRIENDS TO BE ABLE TO

07:18.367 --> 07:19.367
KEEP THEY [bleep] TOGETHER

07:19.367 --> 07:20.367

07:20.367 --> 07:21.667
FRIENDSHIP, YOU SHOULD

07:21.667 --> 07:24.100
DISRESPECT ANYONE.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.800
YOU KNOW THE INCIDENT WAS CRAZY,

07:25.800 --> 07:28.267
AND FROM THERE, I FELT LIKE I

07:28.267 --> 07:30.067
CAN'T [bleep] WITH SHAY.

07:30.067 --> 07:31.100

07:31.100 --> 07:33.167

07:56.867 --> 07:57.967

07:57.967 --> 07:58.800

07:58.800 --> 07:59.867

07:59.867 --> 08:01.100
"FORGIVE ME," AND, "I

08:01.100 --> 08:02.067
APOLOGIZE."

16:00.900 --> 16:02.100
JOSELINE CALLS ME TO HAVE

16:02.100 --> 16:02.867

DESERVE YOUR FAIR SHOT.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.500

16:54.600 --> 16:56.067
SO YOU WANT A RING?

16:56.067 --> 16:56.867
OH, YEAH.

16:56.867 --> 16:58.167
SINCE STEVIE AND I GOT BACK

16:58.167 --> 17:00.867
TOGETHER, WE HAD OUR LITTLE

17:00.867 --> 17:01.533
MEETING.

17:01.533 --> 17:02.533
YOU KNOW, I HAD TO TELL HIM THAT

17:02.533 --> 17:04.200
I REALLY MISSED HIM A LOT.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.533
'CAUSE I DID MISS HIM A LOT.

17:05.533 --> 17:06.733
WE BEEN TALKING, WE BEEN GETTING

17:06.733 --> 17:08.567
TIGHTER, AND WE DON'T ARGUE

17:08.567 --> 17:09.333

17:09.333 --> 17:10.700
IT'S BEEN REALLY GREAT.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.733
I REALIZE THAT I KNOW THAT HE

17:12.733 --> 17:13.833
LOVES ME.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.467
I LOVE HIM.

17:15.467 --> 17:16.833
THIS IS THE MAN I WANT TO MARRY

17:16.833 --> 17:18.300
AND THE MAN I WANT TO BE WITH,

17:18.300 --> 17:21.333
SO I THINK IT'S TIME TO, YOU

17:21.333 --> 17:24.300

17:24.300 --> 17:25.200
I DON'T THINK THAT MAN IS

17:25.200 --> 17:26.067
GONNA COMMIT.

17:26.067 --> 17:27.067
IT AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH

17:27.067 --> 17:28.100
YOU BEING A BAD BITCH AND YOUR

17:28.100 --> 17:30.367

17:32.333 --> 17:33.667
I SEEN A JEKYLL AND HYDE WITH

17:35.400 --> 17:36.133
HEART.

17:36.133 --> 17:37.133
NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES, HE GOT A

17:37.133 --> 17:37.933
GREAT HEART.

17:37.933 --> 17:39.500
LORD, I JUST DON'T WANT YOU

17:39.500 --> 17:40.733
HURT, AND I JUST DON'T WANT

17:48.333 --> 17:49.233

17:50.100 --> 17:52.267
LIKE, OH, I JUST CAN REMEMBER,

17:52.267 --> 17:53.467
STARTING OUT MY CAREER, AND

17:53.467 --> 17:55.133
THERE WAS THE MAN, AND IT WAS

17:55.133 --> 17:57.300
JUST EVERYTHING, AND I WANTED A

17:57.300 --> 17:58.767
RING, AND I WANTED TO GET

17:58.767 --> 17:59.900
MARRIED, AND I LOST FOCUS ON THE

17:59.900 --> 18:00.967
MUSIC.

18:00.967 --> 18:02.467
I WENT FROM HAVING ALL KIND OF

18:02.467 --> 18:04.100
STUFF, HONEY, RIDING AROUND

18:04.100 --> 18:05.833
HERE, GIRL, TO NOT HAVING

18:05.833 --> 18:06.867
ANYWHERE TO STAY.

18:06.867 --> 18:08.833
AND WHAT I DON'T WANT IS SIX

18:08.833 --> 18:10.433
MONTHS, SEVEN MONTHS LATER, WE

18:10.433 --> 18:11.933
BE HAVING ANOTHER DRINK,

18:11.933 --> 18:13.300
SITTING AT ANOTHER RESTAURANT,

18:13.300 --> 18:14.767
AND YOU'LL BE CRYING.

18:14.767 --> 18:16.633
I CAN'T HELP WHO I LOVE.

18:16.633 --> 18:17.633
I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH ANYBODY

18:17.633 --> 18:19.133
ELSE BUT STEVIE.

18:19.133 --> 18:20.167
THIS IS THE MAN I WANT TO MARRY

18:20.167 --> 18:21.367
AND THE MAN I WANT TO BE

18:21.367 --> 18:22.233
WITH.

18:22.233 --> 18:24.833
WITHOUT LOVE, YOU HAVE NOTHING.

18:24.833 --> 18:26.500
IF YOU'RE IN LOVE, BE IN

18:26.500 --> 18:27.400
LOVE, MAN.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.300
THERE'S NOTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL

18:29.300 --> 18:30.833
THAN LOVE, BUT DON'T GET HURT,

18:30.833 --> 18:32.500
AND DON'T BE A FOOL, AND DON'T

18:32.500 --> 18:35.700
MESS UP YOUR CAREER.

18:35.700 --> 18:36.467
WHEN I ASKED YOU, "DO YOU

18:36.467 --> 18:37.533
LOVE ME," WHAT'D YOU TELL ME?

18:37.533 --> 18:39.567
DO YOU LOVE ME?

18:39.567 --> 18:41.800
IS A PIG PORK?

18:41.800 --> 18:42.633
YOU THINK HE'S DOING

18:42.633 --> 18:43.633
SOMETHING, AND THEN HE'S LOOKING

18:43.633 --> 18:45.500
AT YOU LIKE YOU ARE?

18:45.500 --> 18:46.567
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL THAT'S HOW

18:46.567 --> 18:48.567
HE THINK.

18:57.767 --> 18:59.567
"NOT SAYING A WORD.

18:59.567 --> 19:01.533
NEXT TAP ON HIS THIGHS.

19:01.533 --> 19:03.467
PAT, PAT, TAP.

19:03.467 --> 19:04.733
PUTTER, PUTTER,

19:04.733 --> 19:05.833
PUTT-A-TAT."

19:05.833 --> 19:07.400
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO NOT ONLY BE

19:07.400 --> 19:08.900
A MAN BUT BE A GOOD FATHER TO

19:08.900 --> 19:10.233
MY DAUGHTER, MAN, AND LET HER

19:10.233 --> 19:12.800

19:12.800 --> 19:13.700
AND IT'S THE TOUGHEST THING I

19:13.700 --> 19:15.133
EVER HAD TO DO, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE

19:15.133 --> 19:16.233
I AIN'T NEVER REALLY LOVED

19:16.233 --> 19:17.100
NOBODY LIKE THAT.

19:17.100 --> 19:18.367
I FEEL LIKE I REALLY LET HER

19:18.367 --> 19:19.067

19:19.067 --> 19:20.933
SO LOOK, EMANI.

19:20.933 --> 19:21.600
HUH?

19:21.600 --> 19:22.467
WHEN YOU FINISHED, DADDY GOT

19:22.467 --> 19:23.333
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.067
OKAY?

19:24.067 --> 19:26.067
OKAY.

19:29.367 --> 19:30.800
DADDY GOT TO GO TO JAIL, AND

19:30.800 --> 19:33.067
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GONNA

19:33.067 --> 19:35.233

19:35.233 --> 19:36.600

19:37.900 --> 19:39.633

19:39.633 --> 19:41.100
NO, I DIDN'T DO NOTHING BAD.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.167
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE MY

19:42.167 --> 19:43.667
LITTLE LADY'S STRAIGHT.

19:43.667 --> 19:44.667
I WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU STRONG

19:44.667 --> 19:45.833
'CAUSE YOU AIN'T GONNA BE ABLE

19:45.833 --> 19:49.100

19:52.100 --> 19:52.967
THAT MAKE IT WORSE, THOUGH,

19:52.967 --> 19:55.067
WHEN YOU COME SEE ME,

19:55.067 --> 19:55.767
'CAUSE THEN YOU GOT TO LEAVE

19:55.767 --> 19:56.700
WITHOUT ME.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.567
AIN'T GONNA HAVE MY LITTLE ONE

19:58.567 --> 19:59.767
IN THERE, AND I NEED MY LITTLE

19:59.767 --> 20:02.633

20:07.300 --> 20:08.567

20:08.567 --> 20:09.900

20:11.100 --> 20:12.200
JAIL.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.367
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

20:14.367 --> 20:16.600
IT'S A BAD PLACE.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.133
YOU HAVE TO STAND THERE ALL

20:18.133 --> 20:22.233
NIGHT AND FACE THE WALL.

20:22.233 --> 20:24.333
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT MOST

20:24.333 --> 20:26.000
LIKELY, BUT IT'S THE WORST PLACE

20:26.000 --> 20:28.233
IN THE WORLD,

20:28.233 --> 20:29.700
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO EVER GO

20:48.367 --> 20:50.500
AND IT AIN'T RIGHT FOR ME.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.800
I'VE DONE DONE THIS LIKE THREE

21:49.400 --> 21:50.067
AND IT WAS A WRAP.

21:50.067 --> 21:51.933

21:51.933 --> 21:52.967

22:30.833 --> 22:32.400
I TRIED TO EVEN SAY, OKAY,

ABOUT US BRINGING ANOTHER CHILD

22:38.867 --> 22:40.633

22:40.633 --> 22:41.867
AND I QUESTION THAT.

22:41.867 --> 22:42.767
YOU THINK HE'S DOING

22:42.767 --> 22:44.667
SOMETHING, AND THEN HE'S LOOKING

22:44.667 --> 22:45.633
AT YOU LIKE YOU ARE?

22:45.633 --> 22:46.700
THAT'S--YOU KNOW THAT.

22:46.700 --> 22:48.067
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL THAT'S HOW HE

22:48.067 --> 22:48.800
THINK.

22:48.800 --> 22:49.567
THAT'S HOW I DAMN THINK.

22:49.567 --> 22:51.667
THAT'S THE NORM.

22:51.667 --> 22:52.633
THAT'S HOW I THINK TOO.

22:52.633 --> 22:54.267
THAT'S WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

22:54.267 --> 22:55.200
YOU WEREN'T THINKING IT.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.567
HE WAS REALLY DOING SOMETHING.

22:57.567 --> 22:58.567
WHEN YOU ACCUSIN', THAT MEAN

22:58.567 --> 22:59.333
YOU ARE DOIN' THAT.

22:59.333 --> 23:00.267

23:00.267 --> 23:01.133
BECAUSE, YEAH, I WAS SITTIN'

23:01.133 --> 23:02.067
THERE THINKIN' LIKE, "DAMN, IF

23:02.067 --> 23:03.067

23:03.067 --> 23:03.800
WELL, DAMN."

23:03.800 --> 23:04.933
YOU KNOW, DO Y'ALL, 'CAUSE

23:04.933 --> 23:06.567
EVIDENTLY, SHE GOT YOU TRIPPED.

23:06.567 --> 23:07.633
OH, LET'S NOT THINK OF--

23:07.633 --> 23:08.433
DON'T EVEN SAY OR THINK ABOUT

23:08.433 --> 23:09.467
NEW GIRLS.

23:09.467 --> 23:10.300
DON'T PUT THAT IN YOUR HEAD.

23:10.300 --> 23:11.233
AND THAT'S WHAT I--

23:11.233 --> 23:12.667
I THINK I WAS TALKING TO YOU.

23:12.667 --> 23:14.300
I SAID, "LET ME NOT PUT THAT

23:14.300 --> 23:15.067
INTO EXISTENCE."

23:15.067 --> 23:15.667
RIGHT?

23:15.667 --> 23:17.067
PLEASE, JESUS, DON'T DO IT.

23:17.067 --> 23:18.267
I CAN DEFINITELY RELATE WITH YOU

23:18.267 --> 23:20.067
BECAUSE BIG DREW AND I SEPARATED

23:20.067 --> 23:21.633
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT, AND HE

23:21.633 --> 23:22.867
WASN'T THERE FOR ME, AND HE

23:22.867 --> 23:24.500
DIDN'T SUPPORT ME, AND I WENT

23:24.500 --> 23:26.333
THROUGH IT BY MYSELF, AND

23:26.333 --> 23:27.100
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I

23:27.100 --> 23:28.267
WOULD EVER WANT FOR YOU OR FOR

23:28.267 --> 23:30.067
MY WORST ENEMY.

23:30.067 --> 23:31.500
SO I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU GUYS

23:31.500 --> 23:32.467
WORK OUT.

23:32.467 --> 23:33.367
I CAN'T KEEP WORRYIN' ABOUT

23:33.367 --> 23:34.233
THIS [bleep] RIGHT NOW.

23:34.233 --> 23:35.633
ALL I KNOW IS, I NEED TO KEEP IT

23:35.633 --> 23:36.967
[bleep] MOVIN' AND KEEP IT

23:36.967 --> 23:37.633

23:37.633 --> 23:38.867
BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS:

23:38.867 --> 23:40.100
ANYTHING THAT'S GOIN' ON IN THE

23:40.100 --> 23:42.100
DARK, IT WILL COME TO THE LIGHT.

23:42.100 --> 23:44.067
I'M HAPPY THAT YOU PUT THIS

23:44.067 --> 23:45.933
TOGETHER, AND I'M JUST GLAD,

23:45.933 --> 23:47.333
SO I JUST WANT US TO ENJOY OUR

23:47.333 --> 23:49.067
LITTLE FOOD HERE.

23:49.067 --> 23:50.133
LET'S TOAST THIS WATER.

23:50.133 --> 23:50.933
DEFINITELY WE GONNA HAVE A

23:50.933 --> 23:51.667
TOAST.

23:51.667 --> 23:52.933
A BITCH CAN'T HANG OVER ME.

23:52.933 --> 23:54.933
[laughter]

24:09.900 --> 24:11.133
I KNOW I LOVE RASHEEDA, BUT

24:11.133 --> 24:12.233
EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT THE

24:12.233 --> 24:14.067
SITUATION, I'M JUST ANGRY AND

24:14.067 --> 24:15.233
FRUSTRATED AT IT.

24:15.233 --> 24:17.200
15 YEARS IS A LONG TIME TO BE

24:17.200 --> 24:18.567
LOCKED DOWN, SO I'M GOIN' TO

24:18.567 --> 24:19.833
LAKE LANIER WITH MY BOY,

24:26.233 --> 24:27.533
I'M GOING OUT TO DO ME.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.100
SO THAT MEANS NO COMMITMENTS, NO

24:29.100 --> 24:29.833
STRESS.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.833
I'M JUST DOING KIRK.

24:35.467 --> 24:36.733
BOBBY!

24:36.733 --> 24:37.500

WHEN I INVITED HIM UP TO THE

24:53.233 --> 24:54.467

RELAXATION.

24:56.567 --> 24:59.233
BIKES, CIGARS, FISHING.

24:59.233 --> 25:00.833
BUT LEAVE IT UP TO BOBBY V.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.233
HE HAS A BUNCH OF CHICKS RUNNING

25:02.233 --> 25:05.200

25:05.200 --> 25:06.433
LORD KNOWS WHAT WE'RE ABOUT TO

25:06.433 --> 25:08.500

25:09.333 --> 25:10.200
THERE'S THE BEST THING.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.167

25:16.733 --> 25:18.500
LIKE, THIS DUDE HAS THE GIRL

25:18.500 --> 25:20.533

25:20.533 --> 25:22.100
WOW.

25:22.100 --> 25:23.300
DO THEY HAVE TO HANDCUFF HIM?

25:23.300 --> 25:25.300
WHY?

25:27.233 --> 25:28.067
OKAY.

25:28.067 --> 25:30.067

25:44.933 --> 25:46.133

25:46.133 --> 25:46.967

25:46.967 --> 25:48.233
HOLD UP. NO, COME HERE.

25:48.233 --> 25:49.600
I GOT YOU.

25:49.600 --> 25:50.900
SIT.

25:50.900 --> 25:52.467
HE SAID HE REALLY NEEDED TO

25:52.467 --> 25:54.333
TALK TO ME, SO I DECIDED, "LET

25:54.333 --> 25:55.400
ME HEAR THIS DUDE OUT."

25:55.400 --> 25:56.667
YOU PULLING OUT MY CHAIR--

25:56.667 --> 25:58.200
WHY YOU--WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:59.367 --> 26:00.433
I JUST WANTED TO INVITE YOU

26:00.433 --> 26:02.600

26:02.600 --> 26:03.600

26:03.600 --> 26:04.933
A FEW DAYS AGO, I WAS A LITTLE

26:04.933 --> 26:07.067
SURPRISED AT WHAT WAS GOING ON.

26:07.067 --> 26:07.933
AND I WAS JUST AS SURPRISED

26:07.933 --> 26:08.733
AS YOU.

26:08.733 --> 26:09.600
I DID NOT KNOW THAT YOU WAS

26:09.600 --> 26:11.900
GONNA REACT THE WAY YOU DID,

26:11.900 --> 26:13.067
AND I THOUGHT YOU WAS BIGGER

26:13.067 --> 26:14.167
THAN THAT.

26:14.167 --> 26:15.267
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO

26:15.267 --> 26:17.133
DO WITH HOW MANY WOMEN YOU WANT

26:17.133 --> 26:19.400

26:19.400 --> 26:21.733
TO MEET YOU, YOU GO OFF.

26:21.733 --> 26:22.567
MAYBE I DON'T THINK HE'S

26:22.567 --> 26:23.267
GOOD.

26:23.267 --> 26:24.533
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

26:24.533 --> 26:25.733
YOU JUST STARTED COUNTERING HIM

26:25.733 --> 26:26.900
AS YOU SOON AS YOU SAW HIM.

26:26.900 --> 26:27.700
I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING I'M

26:27.700 --> 26:29.400
SUPPOSED TO DO AS A MOTHER, AND

26:29.400 --> 26:30.267

26:30.267 --> 26:31.067

26:33.333 --> 26:34.133
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY

26:34.133 --> 26:34.800
WITH THAT GUY.

26:34.800 --> 26:35.500
AND YOU NOT RESPECT ME.

26:35.500 --> 26:36.300
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY

26:36.300 --> 26:36.967
WITH THAT GUY.

26:36.967 --> 26:37.733
WILL YOU BE HAPPY WITH ANY

26:37.733 --> 26:38.800

26:42.367 --> 26:43.300
WHO'S THE RIGHT DUDE?

26:43.300 --> 26:44.333
SOMETIMES [bleep] COULD BE

26:44.333 --> 26:46.833
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE, AND

26:46.833 --> 26:48.200

26:48.200 --> 26:49.300

26:49.300 --> 26:52.967

27:01.300 --> 27:02.133
WOW.

27:02.133 --> 27:03.800
DREW IS CRAZY TO THINK THAT I'M

27:03.800 --> 27:05.300

27:05.300 --> 27:06.667
THIS DUDE REALLY THINK HE CAN

27:06.667 --> 27:07.367
SCOOP ME.

27:07.367 --> 27:08.767
DREW NEEDS TO RESPECT THE FACT

27:08.767 --> 27:09.800
THAT I'M MOVING FORWARD IN MY

27:09.800 --> 27:11.233
LIFE AND UNDERSTAND THAT I'M

27:11.233 --> 27:12.233
HAPPY.

27:12.233 --> 27:13.933
LET ME BE HAPPY.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.167
MAYBE A PART OF ME FEELS LIKE

27:15.167 --> 27:17.967
I'VE MISSED MY WINDOW, AND WHEN

27:17.967 --> 27:19.833
I REALIZE, LIKE--AT THE END OF

27:19.833 --> 27:21.300
THE DAY, YOU'RE THE MOTHER OF MY

27:21.300 --> 27:22.167
CHILD.

27:22.167 --> 27:23.267
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL,

27:23.267 --> 27:24.500
YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL,

27:24.500 --> 27:26.367
AND WE GET ALONG.

27:26.367 --> 27:28.300
THAT'S A FULL PACKAGE.

27:28.300 --> 27:29.500
I WAS THE SAME FULL PACKAGE

27:29.500 --> 27:30.267
WHEN WE WERE DATING AND I WAS

27:30.267 --> 27:31.300
PREGNANT WITH YOUR CHILD.

27:31.300 --> 27:32.133
YEAH, BUT I WAS WAY YOUNGER.

27:32.133 --> 27:32.833
AND YOU WERE CHEATING.

27:32.833 --> 27:33.567
YEAH, BUT I WAS WAY YOUNGER.

27:33.567 --> 27:34.233
I WAS WAY YOUNGER.

27:34.233 --> 27:35.067
SO YOU BLAME IT ON YOU BEING

27:35.067 --> 27:35.700

27:38.633 --> 27:39.300
AMERICA?

27:39.300 --> 27:40.067
"I HAD TO SOW MY ROYAL OATS."

27:40.067 --> 27:40.800
THAT'S WHAT--I WAS JUST SOWING

27:40.800 --> 27:41.467
MY ROYAL OATS.

27:41.467 --> 27:43.600
WHILE I WAS PREGNANT.

27:43.600 --> 27:44.533
RIGHT NOW, I'M HAPPY WITH WHO

27:47.867 --> 27:48.633
I'MA TELL YOU WHY YOU WANT

27:48.633 --> 27:49.367

27:56.467 --> 27:57.133

27:57.133 --> 27:58.533
YOU'RE WRONG.

27:58.533 --> 28:02.633
I'MA SHOW YOU.

28:02.633 --> 28:03.767

37:22.900 --> 37:24.067
HOLD IT, HOLD IT, HOLD IT.

37:24.067 --> 37:25.233
WHAT DO YOU THINK LOVE IS, KIRK?

37:25.233 --> 37:26.700
LOVE IS DEFINITELY CARING

37:26.700 --> 37:28.067
ABOUT THE PERSON YOU CARE ABOUT,

37:28.067 --> 37:28.900
BEIN' ABLE TO HAVE A FRIEND AND

37:28.900 --> 37:30.200
COMPANION AND DO YOUR THING

37:30.200 --> 37:31.567
WITH.

37:31.567 --> 37:33.200
MY DEFINITION OF LOVE IS

37:33.200 --> 37:34.367
SOMEONE THAT'S YOUR PARTNER,

37:34.367 --> 37:35.533
YOUR LOVER, YOUR BEST FRIEND,

37:35.533 --> 37:36.267
YOUR SOUL MATE.

37:36.267 --> 37:38.300
IT'S NOTHING THAT SOMEONE THAT

37:38.300 --> 37:39.667
YOU LOVE COULD DO THAT YOU

37:39.667 --> 37:40.500
AGAINST.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.567
THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE THAT MY

37:41.567 --> 37:43.167
FRIENDS, LIKE MY HOMEGIRLS ARE

37:43.167 --> 37:44.167
MY SOUL MATES BECAUSE THEY DON'T

37:47.633 --> 37:48.733

37:48.733 --> 37:50.267
DON'T THINK IT'S REALISTIC

37:50.267 --> 37:51.533
BECAUSE IF I DO SOMETHING--

37:51.533 --> 37:52.767
YOU BETTER HIDE.

37:52.767 --> 37:53.433
I--

37:53.433 --> 37:54.767

LIKE, YOU GET TO DO WHAT YOU

37:59.067 --> 37:59.767
WANT TO DO?

37:59.767 --> 38:00.700
'CAUSE YOUR PARENTS GIVE YOU

38:00.700 --> 38:01.367
A PASS.

38:01.367 --> 38:02.100
THAT IS TRUE.

38:02.100 --> 38:03.667
