I HOPE SO.

02:01.752 --> 02:03.494
IF NOT, IT'S A BAD CONNECTION
IN HIS BRAIN.

02:03.494 --> 02:05.396

02:05.396 --> 02:06.527
OH, UM...

02:06.527 --> 02:08.759
I BROUGHT THIS FROM HOME
ACCIDENTALLY.

02:08.759 --> 02:10.461
CAN YOU JUST PUT IT IN
WITH MY DIAPER BAG AND STUFF?

02:10.461 --> 02:13.404

I'LL TRY AND FIND TORRES.

02:14.835 --> 02:16.607
WHAT'S UP, SECOND YEAR?

02:16.607 --> 02:18.509
THIS IS A STEP UP, RIGHT?
ARE THESE ASSIGNED?

YES. THERE'S A LAB COAT

02:21.172 --> 02:22.473
WHAT ARE YOU
SO HAPPY ABOUT?

02:22.473 --> 02:24.515
CAN'T TELL YOU.
YOU WISH I COULD, BUT I CAN'T.

02:24.515 --> 02:26.547
SO PLEASE DON'T ASK.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.179

NO DOORS ON THESE?
I KNOW, RIGHT?

02:36.287 --> 02:39.190
YOU GUYS, THERE'S A COAT HERE
FOR HEATHER BROOKS.

02:39.190 --> 02:39.860
OH, MY GOD.
SERIOUSLY?

02:43.694 --> 02:44.865
OKAY, IS HE BEING WEIRD?

02:44.865 --> 02:46.437
DID HE FAIL THE EXAM?

02:46.437 --> 02:48.199
HE LEFT RIGHT AFTER.
HE DIDN'T COME CELEBRATE.

02:48.199 --> 02:49.500
ALSO, HE KISSED ME.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.673
(gasps)
OH, YEAH, HE KISSED HER.
IT COULD BE THAT.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.476

A SECRET THING GOING, TOO.

HEY! I WOKE UP

YEAH, I WAS OUT LATE.

03:07.258 --> 03:08.889
THIS HAS BEEN
THREE NIGHTS NOW.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.892
YEAH, I'VE BEEN, UH,
GOING OUT. THAT--THAT'S ALL.

I NEVER HEARD FROM YOU.

03:15.466 --> 03:17.197
IS THERE SOMETHING
GOING ON?

03:17.197 --> 03:19.330

03:28.539 --> 03:30.441
UGH. I THOUGHT
SHE WOULD NEVER LEAVE.

03:30.441 --> 03:32.713
HMM?
SO YOU GOT MY TEXTS?

03:32.713 --> 03:33.884
I PASSED MY INTERN EXAM.

03:33.884 --> 03:35.616
YEAH, YEAH, I DID.
I-I REPLIED.

03:35.616 --> 03:38.218
I-I WROTE
"CONGRATULATIONS."

03:38.218 --> 03:39.920
I HOPED I WOULD SEE YOU.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.293
I HAD SUCH AN AMAZING TIME
THE OTHER NIGHT.

03:42.293 --> 03:43.624
YEAH, IT WAS FUN.

03:43.624 --> 03:47.298
I FEEL LIKE I'M READY
TO... TAKE IT FURTHER--

03:47.298 --> 03:50.000
UM, YOU KNOW, UM, IT'S--
IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA,

03:50.000 --> 03:51.862
UM...

03:51.862 --> 03:53.304
I TOTALLY GET IT.

03:53.304 --> 03:56.407

SEE YOU TONIGHT?
MM-HMM.

03:56.407 --> 03:58.008

03:59.840 --> 04:00.911

YOU PAGED ME?

04:00.911 --> 04:04.014

HIS WIFE JOYCE.
HI.

04:04.014 --> 04:05.316
HE'S GOT AN ANKLE FRACTURE.

04:05.316 --> 04:06.717

AT THE AIRPORT--

04:06.717 --> 04:09.480
WE WERE RUNNING TO CATCH
OUR CONNECTION TO ALASKA--

04:09.480 --> 04:10.581
AHH, TO SEE
THE NORTHERN LIGHTS.

04:10.581 --> 04:12.453
(chuckles) THEN HE STEPS
OFF THAT THING,

04:12.453 --> 04:13.924
AND I HEARD IT.
I HEARD IT JUST GO

04:13.924 --> 04:16.487
CRACK.
LIKE THE WHOLE WORLD
SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES,

04:16.487 --> 04:18.329
AND I KEPT GOING.
AND HERE WE ARE.

04:18.329 --> 04:20.631
HE'S GONNA NEED A FULL WORKUP
AND AN ORTHO CONSULT.

04:20.631 --> 04:22.463
ALSO GET A CHEST X-RAY,
'CAUSE IT MIGHT BE SURGICAL.

04:22.463 --> 04:25.836
KEEP ME POSTED.
OKAY.
I WILL GET THOSE X-RAYS.

04:25.836 --> 04:27.468
OH! EXCUSE ME. SORRY.
OH! SORRY.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.770
YOU'RE SURE IT'S NOT WEIRD?
I CALLED YOU.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.271
ROBBINS DOESN'T KNOW
THAT WE'RE DATING, DOES SHE?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.003

TO TRADE ON OUR...

04:33.003 --> 04:36.647
WHATEVER THIS IS TO, UH,
GET TO OBSERVE A SURGERY.
NO.

NOTHING. I GOT IT.

THIS PAIN ISN'T GOING AWAY.

05:42.843 --> 05:47.017
IT'S A CONSTANT PAIN
IN MY LEFT SHOULDER.

05:47.017 --> 05:49.349
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS CAUSING THAT?

05:49.349 --> 05:50.921
WERE YOU INJURED IN A FALL?

05:50.921 --> 05:53.053

YOU'RE MY DOCTOR.

THE EASY CASES.

06:18.108 --> 06:20.050
SHE KEEPS A LOW PROFILE.

06:20.050 --> 06:21.882
BUT SECOND YEAR ATTENDING
HAS GOT TO STEP IT UP--

06:21.882 --> 06:25.015
TAKE THE FLASHY CASES,
PUBLISH THE RESEARCH,

06:25.015 --> 06:27.117
MARK HER TERRITORY.
PEE ON SOME TREES.

06:27.117 --> 06:29.159
PORTAL VEINS... ANY BELLS?

06:29.159 --> 06:31.091
IT WAS YOUR MOTHER'S.

"PORTAL VEIN INTERPOSITION

IT'S IN ONE OF THE JOURNALS
YOU GAVE ME.
OH.

06:39.770 --> 06:41.732
CRAP.

06:41.732 --> 06:42.833
(telephone ringing
in distance)

06:42.833 --> 06:44.735
I HAVE A MUG LIKE THAT.

06:44.735 --> 06:46.837
IF YOU DON'T COME BACK
WITH A SOLID DIAGNOSIS

06:46.837 --> 06:48.108
FOR MY SHOULDER PAIN,

06:48.108 --> 06:49.139
I'M GONNA KICK YOU
OFF MY CASE.

06:49.139 --> 06:51.682

06:51.682 --> 06:56.016
GET OUT.
(sighs)

06:56.016 --> 06:59.950
I NEED A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
FOR WEBBER'S SHOULDER PAIN.

06:59.950 --> 07:01.952
ARTHRITIS, BURSITIS...

07:01.952 --> 07:03.053
HMM.
ANY OF THE OLD PEOPLE
"-ITISES."

07:03.053 --> 07:06.196
STILL WAITING ON
MY BROKEN ANKLE'S CHEST SCANS.

07:06.196 --> 07:07.898
YOU GOT COFFEE.

07:07.898 --> 07:10.200
SO ALEX
ISN'T TALKING TO ME.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.903
I THINK IT'S 'CAUSE I PUSHED HIM
TO TALK TO HIS DEADBEAT DAD.

07:12.903 --> 07:14.665
ALEX HAS A DAD?
MM.

07:14.665 --> 07:16.867
HAVE YOU TALKED TO SHANE?
I'M STILL HOPING IT'LL GO AWAY.

07:16.867 --> 07:18.008
SHANE KISSED ME.
I DIDN'T KISS HIM.
(computer beeps)

07:18.008 --> 07:19.009
IT'S HIS PROBLEM.
MM.

07:19.009 --> 07:20.571
(gasps)

07:20.571 --> 07:23.213
OH...

07:23.213 --> 07:26.877
HE HAS A HUGE TUMOR
IN HIS HEART.

07:26.877 --> 07:28.118
NO...

07:29.720 --> 07:31.221
HE HAS A BROKEN ANKLE.

07:42.933 --> 07:45.866
OKAY, YEAH.
THANK YOU.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.868
YOU OKAY?
YEAH, WHY?

07:47.868 --> 07:48.869
YEAH, WE TESTED
THE NEW SENSORS

07:48.869 --> 07:50.240
WITH MICKEY WENSCHLER
THIS MORNING.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.772
OH.
AND--AND IT WAS
A HUGE SUCCESS.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.173
MM.
BUT HE KEPT ASKING
WHY YOU WEREN'T THERE.

07:53.173 --> 07:56.046
UH, WELL, DIDN'T YOU--
DIDN'T YOU GET MY TEXT?

07:56.046 --> 07:57.207
YOUR TEXT SAID,
"WON'T BE THERE."

07:57.207 --> 08:00.180
OKAY, WELL, UH,
HERE'S THE THING--

08:00.180 --> 08:01.782
MOVING BACK INTO MY PLACE
MADE ME FEEL LIKE

08:01.782 --> 08:04.555
I REALLY NEED TO MOVE BACK
INTO "MY PLACE,"

08:04.555 --> 08:05.956
YOU KNOW, CONCENTRATE
ON WHAT MAKES ME, ME.

08:05.956 --> 08:07.588
I DO REGENERATIVE CARTILAGE.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.059
IT'S WHAT MY T.E.D. TALK
WAS ABOUT--
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

08:09.059 --> 08:10.490
I'M NOT GOING FORWARD
WITH THE PROJECT.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.892
YOU SHOULD TOTALLY
RUN WITH IT, THOUGH.

08:11.892 --> 08:13.023
NO, THIS IS YOUR PROJECT.

08:13.023 --> 08:14.665
MICKEY'S YOUR PATIENT.
I CAN'T DO THIS.

08:14.665 --> 08:15.896
I DON'T HAVE TIME.
MEREDITH AND I

08:15.896 --> 08:17.127
ARE IN OVER OUR HEADS
WITH KIDS,

08:17.127 --> 08:19.570
AND SHE NEEDS TIME, TOO.
SO MAYBE WE JUST DROP IT.

08:19.570 --> 08:21.732
NO HARM DONE, RIGHT?
OH, AND TELL THAT
TO MICKEY WENSCHLER.

08:21.732 --> 08:22.803
MICKEY WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.675
EDWARDS, I JUST SAW
YOUR BROKEN ANKLE.

08:24.675 --> 08:25.976
NO SURGERY, JUST SPLINT IT.

08:25.976 --> 08:29.710
HE WON'T BE ALL RIGHT.
IT'S GONNA KILL HIM.
I KNOW, RIGHT?

08:29.710 --> 08:31.542
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

08:31.542 --> 08:33.714
I CAN'T DO THIS.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.045
DID YOU DO THIS?
UH, I...

08:35.045 --> 08:36.917
I NEED TO FIND KEPNER.
NO, WHO BROKE THIS?

08:36.917 --> 08:39.049
YEAH, SORRY. I DROPPED IT.

08:39.049 --> 08:41.291
DR. YANG, UH, WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THIS?

08:41.291 --> 08:42.893
HOLY--WOW!
I MEAN, IT'S BAD, RIGHT?

08:42.893 --> 08:44.695
LOOK, THIS WASN'T
YOURS TO USE--
SHANE, NOT NOW!

08:44.695 --> 08:47.127
THIS IS A RAT'S NEST OF AN
A.V.M. IN THE LEFT VENTRICLE.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.899
(sighs)
IT'S PROBABLY PUSHING IN
ON THE VALVE.

08:48.899 --> 08:50.661
IF IT'S NOT TREATED,
HE'LL BE DEAD IN MONTHS.

08:50.661 --> 08:53.003
HE CAME IN
FOR A BROKEN ANKLE.

08:53.003 --> 08:56.036
AND NOW I HAVE TO TELL THEM
HE'S DYING.

08:57.307 --> 08:59.740
OKAY, LET ME LOOK
AT THE BLOOD WORK,

08:59.740 --> 09:01.071
AND WE'LL TELL THEM
TOGETHER.

09:01.071 --> 09:03.614
(Emma) GOD, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

09:03.614 --> 09:05.876
THIS PLACE IS A MAZE.

09:05.876 --> 09:08.218
THAT'S DR. ROBBINS?
YEAH.

09:08.218 --> 09:10.581
AND YOU ARE?
(door opens)

09:10.581 --> 09:12.823
DR. ROBBINS, EMMA MARLING.
OH, RIGHT.

09:12.823 --> 09:14.855
RIGHT, RIGHT,
YOU'RE OBSERVING.
AND I'M SCRUBBING IN...

09:14.855 --> 09:16.687
I HOPE.
OH.

09:16.687 --> 09:18.929
MURPHY, I'M SORRY.
WITH DR. MARLING,

09:18.929 --> 09:20.891
I THINK THE TABLE'S FULL.
UM, NEXT TIME?

09:20.891 --> 09:23.664
OKAY, SO WE JUST GAVE LITTLE
ERIN'S PARENTS THE PRE-GAME,

09:23.664 --> 09:24.665
AND WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE HER UP.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.837
MURPHY, WILL YOU SHOW HER
WHERE TO GET SOME SCRUBS?

09:26.837 --> 09:28.969
(elevator bell dings)

09:28.969 --> 09:31.171
VISITING SURGEON?

09:31.171 --> 09:32.943
(sighs) YEAH, MATERNAL/FETAL.
SHE'S RESEARCHING

09:32.943 --> 09:35.806
MINIMALLY INVASIVE
IN-UTERO TERATOMAS.

09:35.806 --> 09:37.878
AND SHE'S HOT.
I'M JUST SAYING

09:37.878 --> 09:39.680
IT'S GOOD THAT
I'LL BE THERE TO CHAPERONE.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.783
WHAT, WE'RE NOT
JOKING ABOUT THIS YET?

09:42.783 --> 09:46.356
(laughs) SEE YOU IN THERE.

09:46.356 --> 09:47.718
(panting)

09:47.718 --> 09:49.319
(indistinct conversations)

09:49.319 --> 09:51.121
HERE.
(sets down book)

09:51.121 --> 09:52.793
THIS IS MY MOTHER'S JOURNAL.
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

09:52.793 --> 09:54.995
(breathes heavily) WEBBER...
MADE ME GO TO HIS HOUSE.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.266
AND I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHY HIS SHOULDER HURTS.

09:56.266 --> 09:57.968
CAN I GO?
YEAH.

09:57.968 --> 09:59.229
(sighs)

09:59.229 --> 10:00.901
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?
RESEARCH FUNDING.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.203
I'M TRYING TO DECIDE
BETWEEN AN ISCHEMIA STUDY

10:03.203 --> 10:05.876
AND THIS PORTAL VEIN THING
THAT MY MOTHER WAS WORKING ON.

10:05.876 --> 10:07.708
(gasps) OOH! DO THAT.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.009
IT'S HALF-BAKED.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.240
A-AND I DON'T LIKE TRADING
ON MY MOTHER'S NAME.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.783
NO, IT'S YOUR STORY. YEAH.

10:12.783 --> 10:14.614
"BRILLIANT YOUNG SURGEON
FINISHES WORK

10:14.614 --> 10:15.816
OF DEAD BRILLIANT
MOTHER SURGEON"--

10:15.816 --> 10:17.918
IT WRITES ITSELF.
INVEST IN YOUR BRAND.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.720
YOU MAKE ME SOUND
LIKE A SOFT DRINK.
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.692
YEAH, I'M REINVESTING
IN MYSELF.

10:21.692 --> 10:22.853
THAT'S THE PERFECT REASON...
RIGHT?

10:22.853 --> 10:23.994
NOT TO.
(elevator bell dings)

10:23.994 --> 10:26.827
SHANE, HERE YOU GO.
SOME GOOD STUFF IN THERE.

10:26.827 --> 10:30.230
ENJOY.
(clicks tongue) UGH.
YOU DON'T GET IT.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.832
(beeps)

10:31.832 --> 10:33.834
THESE ARE MICKEY'S M.R.I.s?
MM-HMM.

10:33.834 --> 10:37.668
DR. SHEPHERD...
I WONDERED IF YOU'D MIND

10:37.668 --> 10:39.269
IF I SWITCH SERVICES
AFTER TODAY.

10:39.269 --> 10:42.673
(sighs) I ASKED FOR YOU
SPECIFICALLY.
I KNOW.

10:42.673 --> 10:44.675
LOOK, WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR
BETWEEN YOU AND BROOKS,

10:44.675 --> 10:46.076
I THINK
I MAY HAVE BEEN UNFAIR,

10:46.076 --> 10:47.878
AND I WAS HOPING FOR
A CHANCE TO MAKE IT RIGHT.

10:47.878 --> 10:51.321
SO... NOW THAT
BROOKS IS GONE...

10:51.321 --> 10:53.123
I GET TO TAKE HER PLACE?
OH, HELL.

10:53.123 --> 10:56.656
WELL, THAT'S WHY
THE SENSORS WEREN'T LIGHTING.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.688
HE HAS A GLIOMA.

10:57.688 --> 10:59.790
CAN YOU TREAT IT?

10:59.790 --> 11:01.031
I COULD TRY HITTING IT
WITH SOME GLUE.

11:01.031 --> 11:03.964
GLUE?
EMBOLIZATION GLUE.
WE USE IT FOR A.V.M.s.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.766
WE PUMP SUPERGLUE
INTO THE VESSELS,

11:05.766 --> 11:08.238
THE GLUE HARDENS,
CUTS OFF BLOOD TO THE TUMOR.

11:08.238 --> 11:10.701
I COULD TRY IT. MM...

11:10.701 --> 11:12.102
NO. IT GOES ALL THE WAY
TO THE BRAIN STEM.

11:12.102 --> 11:14.174
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
AND GOING IN SURGICALLY?

11:14.174 --> 11:15.445
IT'S THE SAME THING.

11:15.445 --> 11:16.907
I'M AFRAID OF DOING
MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

11:17.908 --> 11:20.280
(Cristina)
IT'S A VERY DEADLY MASS.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.754
IT'S A LARGE VEINOUS
MALFORMATION...
(mouse clicks)

11:23.754 --> 11:25.315
AND WITHOUT INTERVENTION
IMMEDIATELY,

11:25.315 --> 11:27.818
I'M AFRAID THE PROGNOSIS
IS VERY BAD.

11:27.818 --> 11:30.791
YEAH, THAT'S THE THING.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.193
UM, I HAVE BEEN DYING OF THAT
FOR YEARS.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.195
(mouths words)
(elevator bell dings)

11:35.195 --> 11:36.867
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS
AND YOU DIDN'T MENTION IT?

11:36.867 --> 11:38.328
I'M SORRY.
IN YOUR MEDICAL HISTORY,
THERE'S--

11:38.328 --> 11:40.330
I WAS SO HUNG UP
ON MISSING OUR PLANE--

11:40.330 --> 11:42.202
IT'S AN INOPERABLE A.V.M.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.174
HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH IT,
WHAT, A Y--

11:44.174 --> 11:46.036
YEAR AND A HALF--
YEAR BEFORE LAST, YEAH.

11:46.036 --> 11:47.908
JANUARY.
AND TERMINAL.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.740
SO... (chuckles)
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

11:49.740 --> 11:52.242
SO WE JUST QUIT OUR JOBS,
CASHED OUT ALL OUR ACCOUNTS,

11:52.242 --> 11:55.816
AND JUST STARTED TRAVELING.
YEAH, JUST DOING STUFF--

11:55.816 --> 11:58.388
TRIPS, ACTIVITIES, BASICALLY
CRAMMING AS MUCH LIVING

11:58.388 --> 12:00.821
AS WE COULD INTO
THE TIME WE HAVE LEFT.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.722
OKAY, DID YOUR DOCTOR--
DID HE OR--OR--

12:02.722 --> 12:05.125
OR SHE, UH, TRY TREATING IT
WITH RADIATION?

12:05.125 --> 12:06.927
YEAH, TRIED THAT.
INTRAVENOUS COILING?

12:06.927 --> 12:08.899
MM-HMM. YEAH, NO DICE.

12:08.899 --> 12:10.160
AND THE SCLEROSING AGENTS--

12:10.160 --> 12:12.362
UH, WHAT ABOUT A TRANSPLANT?
OR WHAT ABOUT...

12:12.362 --> 12:14.204
THERE ARE A LOT OF--

12:14.204 --> 12:16.366
SWEETIE...

12:16.366 --> 12:17.908
I KNOW IT'S HARD.

12:17.908 --> 12:19.810
IT WAS HARD FOR US, TOO.

12:21.271 --> 12:22.742
BUT YOU HAVE TO LET IT GO.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.776
(Derek) BECAUSE THERE IS
NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT.

12:25.776 --> 12:27.778
I'M SORRY.
THE BEST COURSE

12:27.778 --> 12:30.821
IS TO LEAVE IT ALONE
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

12:30.821 --> 12:32.522
WE'LL KEEP DOING
THE STUDY, RIGHT?

12:32.522 --> 12:35.485
COME ON. WHY?
BECAUSE IT IS TOO DANGEROUS.

12:35.485 --> 12:38.058
ALSO THE TUMOR COULD GIVE US
ABNORMAL RESULTS.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.890
WHAT IF YOU TAKE
THE TUMOR OUT?

12:39.890 --> 12:42.392
I COULD KEEP DOING
THE TESTING.
YOU COULD, BUT--

12:42.392 --> 12:43.934
THEN TAKE IT OUT, MAN!

12:43.934 --> 12:45.465
WE'RE SO CLOSE, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.839
THIS MORNING, I WAS MILES
BEYOND ANYTHING

12:48.839 --> 12:49.900
WHAT I DID LAST TIME--
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

12:49.900 --> 12:50.801
WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU
UP THERE,

12:50.801 --> 12:52.372
WE'RE GONNA REMOVE
YOUR SENSORS,

12:52.372 --> 12:53.804
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
CLOSE YOUR CRANIOTOMY--
WHAT IF I DON'T CONSENT?

12:53.804 --> 12:55.806
WHAT?

12:55.806 --> 12:58.248
WHAT IF I SAY YOU CAN'T
TAKE YOUR SENSORS BACK

12:58.248 --> 13:00.380
UNLESS YOU TAKE
MY TUMOR, TOO?

13:00.380 --> 13:01.852
MICKEY, I NEED
TO TAKE THEM OUT.

13:01.852 --> 13:03.513
SORRY, BUD.

13:03.513 --> 13:04.915
ACCESS DENIED.

13:04.915 --> 13:06.216
YOU'RE NOT GOING IN MY HEAD

13:06.216 --> 13:08.458
UNLESS YOU'RE LEAVING
WITH THAT TUMOR.

13:14.424 --> 13:16.266
(Emma) LUCKY YOU USE
ELECTRO-THERMAL SEALERS.

13:16.266 --> 13:17.868
THEY'RE TOO BIG TO GET IN THERE
WHEN WE DO THESE IN-UTERO.

13:17.868 --> 13:19.799
BEAR WITH ME, EMMA.
ALEX, I NEED YOUR ADVICE.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.571
WHAT'S YOUR STRATEGY WHEN
YOU HAVE A ONE-NIGHT-STAND--

13:21.571 --> 13:24.274
NOT EVEN--YOU JUST
MAKE OUT WITH SOMEONE,

13:24.274 --> 13:25.305
AND THEN THEY GET
WAY TOO ATTACHED?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.277
YOU KNOW WHO'S LIKE THAT?

13:27.277 --> 13:28.438
LEAH MURPHY.

13:28.438 --> 13:30.110
REALLY?

13:30.110 --> 13:31.942
YEAH, I SLEPT WITH HER ONE,
MAYBE TWO TIMES.

13:31.942 --> 13:33.483
SHE STUCK TO ME LIKE GLUE.

13:33.483 --> 13:35.485
THAT GIRL GOES FROM ZERO
TO "I LOVE YOU"

13:35.485 --> 13:36.586
IN SEVEN SECONDS.

13:36.586 --> 13:39.249
I'VE NEVER, EVER FELT THIS WAY.

13:39.249 --> 13:40.851
AND IF I TELL YOU GUYS
WHO IT IS,

13:40.851 --> 13:42.322
IT WOULD CAUSE SO MANY
PROBLEMS FOR ME

13:42.322 --> 13:44.494
AND FOR THIS PERSON, AND...

13:44.494 --> 13:47.257
GOD, FOR THE HOSPITAL,
PROBABLY.

13:47.257 --> 13:48.298
SO PLEASE DON'T ASK.

13:48.298 --> 13:49.499
COULD IT BE
HEART-RELATED?

13:49.499 --> 13:51.501
HE HAD VENTRICULAR FAILURE.
WHAT?

13:51.501 --> 13:53.263
WEBBER'S SHOULDER HURTS.

13:53.263 --> 13:54.304
HEY,
DID YOU TALK TO ALEX?

13:54.304 --> 13:56.366
YEAH, I TRIED.
HE JUST KEEPS RUNNING AWAY.

13:56.366 --> 13:58.869
HE'S DUMPING YOU.
IT'S WHAT HE DID WITH ME.

13:58.869 --> 14:01.071
HE'LL PRETEND YOU'RE NOT THERE
UNTIL YOU'RE NOT THERE.

14:01.071 --> 14:02.242
AND WHEN YOU'RE NOT THERE,

14:02.242 --> 14:03.944
HE'LL HAVE SEX
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.176
WHY ARE YOU GLUING MY MUG?
IT'S NOT YOURS.
IT'S SHEPHERD'S.

14:06.176 --> 14:07.847
THE MUG WAS
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.549
HOW'D YOU BREAK IT?
SHE GOT SCARED BY A TUMOR.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.522
IT'S AN A.V.M.,
AND IT'S A SCARY ONE.

14:12.522 --> 14:14.024
TOTALLY INOPERABLE.

14:14.024 --> 14:15.155
GUY PROBABLY
HAS MONTHS TO LIVE,

14:15.155 --> 14:16.286
AND HE AND IS HIS POOR WIFE
ARE JUST TRYING TO MAKE

14:16.286 --> 14:17.888
THE MOST OF THEIR TIME
TOGETHER.

14:17.888 --> 14:19.189
(man) ♪ ...WHAT'S GOOD ♪

14:19.189 --> 14:21.031

HEY, WHAT ABOUT GLUE?

14:28.498 --> 14:32.042
WHAT ABOUT GLUE?
I'M SORRY. FOR YOUR A.V.M.--

14:32.042 --> 14:34.144
THIS A.V.M. LOOK,
DR. SHEPHERD WAS TALKING

14:34.144 --> 14:35.275
ABOUT THE EMBOLIZATION GLUE

14:35.275 --> 14:37.177
THEY USE IN NEURO A.V.M.s,
AND I WONDERED--

14:37.177 --> 14:39.179
HAS THIS APPROACH
EVER BEEN USED IN THE HEART?

14:39.179 --> 14:42.552
NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.
SO... NO.

14:42.552 --> 14:44.214
(woman speaking indistinctly
over. P.A.)

14:44.214 --> 14:46.886
THEY GLUE NEURO A.V.M.s
BECAUSE THEY'RE MICROSCOPIC.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.359
THESE VESSELS ARE HUGE.

14:49.359 --> 14:52.262
YOU SAYING IT WON'T WORK?
I'M SAYING...

14:52.262 --> 14:54.394
I'D NEED A CRAPLOAD
OF GLUE.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.026
I'M SAYING THE GLUE
WON'T WORK,

14:56.026 --> 14:57.267
THE RADIATION WON'T WORK,

14:57.267 --> 14:58.198
AND I DON'T WANT
TO GO IN SURGICALLY.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.599
I RISK KILLING HIM.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.302
SO HE'S HOLDING YOUR SENSORS
HOSTAGE IN HIS SKULL? (chuckles)

15:02.302 --> 15:04.474
THIS IS NOT FUNNY, CALLIE.
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO HIM.

15:04.474 --> 15:06.576
IT'S MICKEY.
JUST GIVE HIM A FEW HOURS.

15:06.576 --> 15:09.179
HE'LL COME AROUND.
(sighs)

15:09.179 --> 15:10.580
(typing)

15:10.580 --> 15:11.942
YOU DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO HIM

15:11.942 --> 15:13.243
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO LOOK HIM IN THE EYE

15:13.243 --> 15:15.115
AND TELL HIM
YOU'RE BAILING ON THIS.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.447
AND YOU CERTAINLY
DON'T WANT TO TELL HIM

15:17.447 --> 15:19.019
WHY YOU'RE BAILING.

15:23.223 --> 15:24.654
(clicks tongue)
WHY IS THAT?

15:24.654 --> 15:27.357
YOU STARTED THIS PROJECT
FOR ARIZONA.

15:27.357 --> 15:31.131
WHEN YOU LOST INTEREST IN HER,
YOU LOST INTEREST IN THIS.

15:31.131 --> 15:32.462
YOU'RE LETTING
YOUR PERSONAL PROBLEMS

15:32.462 --> 15:34.134
GET IN THE WAY
OF MONTHS OF RESEARCH.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.165
WELL, YOU'RE DOING
THE SAME THING.

15:35.165 --> 15:36.406
YOU SAID YOU WERE DONE
WITH THE STUDY

15:36.406 --> 15:38.138
TO SPEND TIME
WITH YOUR KIDS.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.540
THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.
OH, WHY IS IT DIFFERENT,
DEREK?

15:40.540 --> 15:43.013
'CAUSE YOUR FAMILY'S PERFECT,
AND MINE'S A DISASTER?

15:43.013 --> 15:44.244
BECAUSE YOU'RE LEAVING
THE STUDY TO SUPPORT YOUR WIFE,

15:44.244 --> 15:45.945
AND I'M DOING IT
TO FORGET MINE?

15:45.945 --> 15:48.248
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH.
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT IT.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.351
YOU GUYS
HAVE FIGURED IT OUT--

15:51.351 --> 15:54.184
HOW TO MAKE THE PIECES FIT.

15:54.184 --> 15:55.485
(voice breaking) AND I THOUGHT
WE DID, TOO, BUT...

15:57.627 --> 16:01.531
(sighs) I'M FIGURING THIS OUT
FOR MYSELF NOW, SO...

16:01.531 --> 16:03.733
JUST BEAR WITH ME, OKAY?

16:07.467 --> 16:11.471
(sighs deeply)
I WILL TALK TO MICKEY.

16:11.471 --> 16:15.405
AND I'M GONNA ASK YOU
A SERIES OF QUESTIONS.

16:15.405 --> 16:17.047
"ARE YOU A TENNIS PLAYER?"

16:17.047 --> 16:18.208
OH, GOOD LORD.

16:18.208 --> 16:21.681
"DO YOU FREQUENTLY CARRY
HEAVY LOADS,

16:21.681 --> 16:24.254
"GROCERIES, ETCETERA,
WITH YOUR INJURED ARM?"

16:24.254 --> 16:26.056
I'VE BEEN IN THIS BED
A MONTH.

16:26.056 --> 16:28.118
I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE THOROUGH.

16:28.118 --> 16:29.519
UM... (clears throat)

16:29.519 --> 16:32.462
"HAVE YOU RECENTLY ENGAGED
IN ANY STRENUOUS SEXUAL--"

16:32.462 --> 16:34.224
(elevator bell dings)
I AM SKIPPING THAT ONE...
(chuckles)

16:34.224 --> 16:36.326
UH, TOO, UH...

16:36.326 --> 16:37.627
(paper rustles)
UM...

16:37.627 --> 16:39.269
(monitor beeps)
(grunting)

16:39.269 --> 16:43.403
UH... I'M NOT GETTING
A VERY GOOD READING ON,

16:43.403 --> 16:45.004
UH, SIR, ARE YOU--
OH--OH...

16:45.004 --> 16:48.208
IT IS NOT MY TENNIS GAME,
AND IT'S NOT MY HEART.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.009
LOOK DEEPER.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.711
NOW GET OUT, AND TAKE
THAT THING WITH YOU.

16:53.283 --> 16:55.785
(sighs)
(button clicks,
machine beeps and whirs)

16:55.785 --> 16:57.717
UM...

16:57.717 --> 17:02.552
(whirring)

17:02.552 --> 17:04.094
(beeps)

17:04.094 --> 17:06.426
OH, COME ON.
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.498
(paper rustles)

17:08.498 --> 17:11.561
"ISCHEMIA REPERFUSION
INJURY IN THORACIC TRAUMA"?
(printer clatters,
computer beeps)

17:11.561 --> 17:13.263
WHAT HAPPENED
TO PORTAL VEINS?

17:13.263 --> 17:15.235
I KNOW ISCHEMIA IS BORING,

17:15.235 --> 17:17.407
BUT MY MOTHER'S PORTAL VEIN
RESEARCH IS OUTDATED.

17:17.407 --> 17:19.369
I MEAN, WE'VE ALREADY
GRAFTED THEM FROM STEM CELLS.

17:19.369 --> 17:20.710
AND I DON'T WANT
TO SPEND MY LIFE

17:20.710 --> 17:22.372
BEING COMPARED TO MY MOTHER.
HEY.

17:22.372 --> 17:24.114
SHE WAS A SMART WOMAN.

17:24.114 --> 17:26.246
IT MIGHT BE WORSE
TO NEVER BE COMPARED TO HER.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.378
I CAN'T FIND A WAY
TO TAKE THE RESEARCH FURTHER.
(printer whirs and beeps)

17:28.378 --> 17:31.421
AND I CAN'T PRINT
THIS DAMN THING!
(lid clacks)

17:31.421 --> 17:34.124
(sighs)

17:37.757 --> 17:39.589
YOU ALL RIGHT?

17:39.589 --> 17:42.832
WE'VE BIO-ENGINEERED
BLOOD VESSELS

17:42.832 --> 17:44.294
FROM A 3-D PRINTER.

17:44.294 --> 17:45.695
YEAH.

17:45.695 --> 17:50.500
BUT I DON'T THINK ANYONE
HAS EVER PRINTED A PORTAL VEIN.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.343
(Cristina)
IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.

17:53.343 --> 17:56.246
THE GLUE IS DESIGNED
FOR USE IN YOUR BRAIN,

17:56.246 --> 17:58.648
BUT I WOULD LIKE
TO TRY IT IN YOUR HEART.

17:58.648 --> 18:00.380
IT--IT'S A BOLD APPROACH.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.781
WAI--ARE YOU--
ARE YOU SAYING THAT--

18:01.781 --> 18:04.484
I AM OPTIMISTIC
THAT IT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.387
THAT'S AWFUL.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.289
I'M SORRY?

18:09.289 --> 18:11.821
(stammers)

18:11.821 --> 18:14.224
AFTER WE GOT BEN'S DIAGNOSIS,
WELL, I MEAN, YOU--YOU KNOW,

18:14.224 --> 18:15.865
WE--WE--WE SOLD EVERYTHING.

18:15.865 --> 18:17.297
WE--WE CASHED OUT
ALL OUR ACCOUNTS.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.530
WE MAXED OUT OUR CREDIT CARDS
AND MORE CREDIT CARDS.

18:20.530 --> 18:21.701
WE WENT TO EUROPE.
WE WENT TO INDIA.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.873
WE WENT TO MOROCCO.

18:23.873 --> 18:25.335
WE RENTED A WHOLE ISLAND.

18:25.335 --> 18:27.807
WE--WE WENT UP IN THAT PLANE
WHERE YOU GET TO BE WEIGHTLESS.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.339
THAT'S 5 GRAND A POP.

18:29.339 --> 18:31.711
WE WENT UP 11 TIMES--
AND THEN BOUGHT A BOAT.

18:31.711 --> 18:34.314
AND THEN WE BLEW IT UP, 'CAUSE
WE WANTED TO WATCH IT BURN.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.715
(lowered voice)
WE OWE CREDITORS

18:35.715 --> 18:38.548
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS.

18:38.548 --> 18:41.191
HOW WERE YOU PLANNING
TO PAY FOR--
LIFE INSURANCE.

18:41.191 --> 18:43.293
(Joyce)
BEN'S A VERY GOOD PLANNER.
I THOUGHT I WAS.

18:43.293 --> 18:44.824
I DIDN'T PLAN FOR SURVIVING.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.628
BUT STILL, HON...
OH.

18:48.628 --> 18:52.232
WE... WE GOTTA TRY IT, RIGHT?

18:52.232 --> 18:53.803
(inhales deeply)

18:53.803 --> 18:56.366
WAIT.

18:56.366 --> 18:57.737
WHAT ARE THE RISKS?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.769
WELL, AS I SAID,

18:59.769 --> 19:02.542
THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE
ON A BEATING HEART.

19:02.542 --> 19:03.743
COULD I DIE?

19:05.345 --> 19:07.317
COULD I DIE ON THE TABLE?

19:08.278 --> 19:11.221
IT'S POSSIBLE.

19:11.221 --> 19:13.683
THEN THERE'S HOPE.

19:13.683 --> 19:16.356
(sighs)

19:23.563 --> 19:24.664
I WANT A C-ARM SET UP
IN THE O.R.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.236
I MAY HAVE TO DO
A CRASH STERNOTOMY.
REALLY?

19:26.236 --> 19:27.337
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

19:27.337 --> 19:28.698
THIS HAS NEVER
BEEN DONE BEFORE.

19:28.698 --> 19:29.839
HOW MUCH A.V.M. GLUE
DO YOU THINK WE'LL NEED?

19:29.839 --> 19:30.900
AGAIN,
NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.

19:30.900 --> 19:32.642
ERR ON THE SIDE
OF ALL OF IT.

19:32.642 --> 19:34.204
WHERE IS IT?
WHERE IS WHAT?

19:34.204 --> 19:35.575
MY MOTHER'S JOURNAL.
WHY WOULD I KNOW?

19:35.575 --> 19:36.746
THE BLACK BOOK--

19:36.746 --> 19:38.177
THE LITTLE BLACK BOOK
I GAVE YOU TODAY--

19:38.177 --> 19:39.579
I NEED IT BACK, SHANE.
I THINK I LEFT IT
WITH EDWARDS.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.211
EDWARDS!
WHAT?

19:41.211 --> 19:43.413
E.R. NEEDS THIS BED.
CAN YOU HELP ME?
(clatters)

19:43.413 --> 19:45.184
HEY, AND WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH MR. BOSCO?

19:45.184 --> 19:47.717
(wheels clattering)
WHY HAS A BROKEN ANKLE
BEEN MOVED TO PRE-OP

19:47.717 --> 19:49.559
FOR A CARDIAC PROCEDURE?
WHAT?

19:49.559 --> 19:51.891
YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE COURSE
OF TREATMENT LIKE THAT

19:51.891 --> 19:54.664
WITHOUT--
I DIDN'T. THE CARDIO CONSULT
DECLARED IT INOPERABLE.

19:54.664 --> 19:56.426
SO THEN WHY
IS HE IN PRE-OP? WHO--

19:56.426 --> 19:58.598
WHO DID THE CONSULT?
DR. YANG!

19:58.598 --> 20:00.370
WHAT?
SORRY.
WE WERE IN HERE BEFORE,

20:00.370 --> 20:03.773
AND I THINK I LEFT
MY... PHONE.

20:03.773 --> 20:05.405
WELL, WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

20:05.405 --> 20:06.736
OH, A VENTRICULAR A.V.M.

20:06.736 --> 20:09.839
I'M DOING LIQUID EMBOLIZATION
WITH GLUE.

20:09.839 --> 20:11.741
WAIT, GLUE
FOR BRAIN ANEURYSMS?

20:11.741 --> 20:14.984
HAS THAT BEEN TRIED
ON A HEART BEFORE?

20:14.984 --> 20:17.517
THANK YOU.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

20:17.517 --> 20:18.818
NO.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.690
ARE YOU SURE IT'LL WORK?

20:20.690 --> 20:22.522
(sighs) THAT IS ALSO A NO.

20:22.522 --> 20:25.795
I-I AM IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR ENORMOUS BALLS.

20:25.795 --> 20:28.998
I WISH I COULD STICK AROUND
AND WATCH THIS.

20:28.998 --> 20:30.660
I'M CRISTINA...
BY THE WAY.

20:30.660 --> 20:34.434
CRISTINA YANG.
JUST SO YOU KNOW.

20:34.434 --> 20:37.337
YEAH, I KNOW. WE'VE MET
A COUPLE OF TIMES, ACTUALLY.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.608
EMMA MARLING.

20:38.608 --> 20:41.711
I KNOW. I'M--I'M SAYING
I'M OWEN'S, UM...

20:41.711 --> 20:43.713
(clicks tongue)

20:43.713 --> 20:45.975
EX-WIFE.

20:45.975 --> 20:48.748
AH! YES.

20:48.748 --> 20:51.281
(pats countertop)
RIGHT.

20:51.281 --> 20:53.453
WELL, THIS LOOKS AMAZING.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.955
AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO HEAR HOW IT WENT.

20:55.955 --> 20:59.258
(sniffs) GOOD NIGHT.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.690
(door opens)

21:00.690 --> 21:02.832
YOU WEREN'T GONNA
SAY GOOD NIGHT?
OH, HEY.

21:02.832 --> 21:04.434
I'M OFF. I'LL--
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

21:04.434 --> 21:05.765
WILL YOU?

21:05.765 --> 21:07.967
(sighs) PROBABLY NOT.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.500
I'LL PROBABLY BE LATE.
ARE YOU SEEING SOMEONE ELSE?

21:10.500 --> 21:11.841
IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING?

21:11.841 --> 21:13.673
'CAUSE I JUST NEED TO KNOW.
OH, IT'S NOT THAT.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.005
THEN WHAT IS IT?
(sighs)

21:16.005 --> 21:18.508
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

21:18.508 --> 21:19.979
(Mickey) IT IS BETWEEN
ME AND SHEPHERD,

21:19.979 --> 21:21.751
AND I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING
HE NEEDS TO KNOW.
MICKEY...

21:21.751 --> 21:25.655
(zapping)
MICKEY, LOOK AT ME.

21:25.655 --> 21:28.057
IF I DO,
THE ALIENS WILL WIN.

21:28.057 --> 21:30.390
(turns off monitor)

21:32.362 --> 21:35.825
THIS OPERATION
COULD KILL YOU.

21:35.825 --> 21:38.828
(sighs)

21:41.831 --> 21:44.374
I NEVER TOLD YOU
HOW I BECAME A QUAD, DID I?

21:44.374 --> 21:48.338
(clicks tongue)
YOU WERE IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

21:48.338 --> 21:51.611
(sighs)

21:51.611 --> 21:53.883
I CAUSED A CAR ACCIDENT...

21:53.883 --> 21:57.587
BECAUSE I WAS DRUNK.
I GOT DRUNK,

21:57.587 --> 22:00.750
AND I DROVE,
AND I HIT ANOTHER CAR,

22:00.750 --> 22:03.653
AND I KILLED
TWO TEENAGE GIRLS--

22:03.653 --> 22:06.025
LINDSAY AND CHERYL.

22:06.025 --> 22:09.999
SO THERE I AM,
A PILE OF GARBAGE.

22:09.999 --> 22:11.801
CAN'T MOVE, CAN'T WALK,
CAN'T DO ANYTHING

22:11.801 --> 22:15.034
EXCEPT THINK ABOUT
WHAT I DID...

22:15.034 --> 22:17.767
TO THOSE FAMILIES.

22:17.767 --> 22:19.839
(sighs)

22:19.839 --> 22:23.373
I'VE GOT PEOPLE
TENDING TO ME.

22:23.373 --> 22:24.714
PEOPLE FEED ME

22:24.714 --> 22:27.777
AND SHAVE ME
AND CLEAN ME,

22:27.777 --> 22:28.778
AND I DON'T DESERVE
THEIR TIME.

22:28.778 --> 22:32.882
I DESERVE... TO HAVE DIED
IN THAT CAR.

22:32.882 --> 22:36.786
AND I WISH I DID
EVERY DAY...

22:36.786 --> 22:38.488
FOR NINE YEARS.

22:38.488 --> 22:41.691
AND WHEN YOU ASKED ME...

22:41.691 --> 22:44.363
TO DO THIS...

22:44.363 --> 22:45.965
(exhales)

22:45.965 --> 22:49.499
WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
TO DO SOMETHING

22:49.499 --> 22:52.442
AFFECTING SOMEONE
IN A GOOD WAY...

22:55.575 --> 22:57.146
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

22:57.146 --> 23:00.109
I THOUGHT I WAS WORTH
HAVING AROUND.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.683
IF I DIE,

23:03.683 --> 23:07.857
GIVE MY BRAIN TO SCIENCE,
AND I STILL HELP.

23:10.820 --> 23:13.493
(voice breaking)
LET ME HELP.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.966
PLEASE.

23:16.966 --> 23:19.869
(man)
AND HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

23:19.869 --> 23:22.802
OH, HEY.
SAME AS LAST NIGHT?

23:22.802 --> 23:24.774
YEAH, THANKS.

23:24.774 --> 23:26.736

23:26.736 --> 23:28.638

23:28.638 --> 23:31.080

23:31.080 --> 23:32.882

23:54.003 --> 23:55.064
I STILL THINK
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

23:55.064 --> 23:56.566
I-I KNOW,
BUT IT'S THE RIGHT IDEA.

23:56.566 --> 24:00.069
MICKEY HAS NOTHING TO LOSE
AND A LOT TO GAIN.

24:00.069 --> 24:03.473
OKAY, I'LL SCHEDULE HIM

24:03.473 --> 24:04.844
OKAY.
OH, NO, WAIT.
I CAN'T DO TOMORROW MORNING.

24:31.501 --> 24:32.672

24:32.672 --> 24:34.944

THIS WHOLE THING.

24:34.944 --> 24:39.509

IS STUCK TO THE VEIN.

24:39.509 --> 24:41.080
GOD, THIS STUFF
IS INTENSE.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.481

THAT HARD?

24:42.481 --> 24:46.485
WELL, YOU WANT ME

24:46.485 --> 24:49.689
OKAY. OKAY, WE'RE GOOD.

YOU'LL FIND?

25:04.273 --> 25:07.176
WELL, IF IT'S NOT ARTHRITIS
OR BURSITIS OR ROTATOR CUFF,

25:07.176 --> 25:09.278
AND YOUR HEART'S FINE,
THEN IT CAN'T HURT.

25:09.278 --> 25:11.881
UNLESS IT'S REFERRED PAIN,
WHICH COULD BE NERVE IMPINGEMENT

25:11.881 --> 25:14.614
OR DIAPHRAGMATIC IRRITATION,
SO...

25:15.845 --> 25:19.148
(gasps)
YOU DON'T NEED AN X-RAY.

25:19.148 --> 25:21.821
BRAVO.
(exhales deeply)

25:21.821 --> 25:24.093
YOU NEED AN ULTRASOUND.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.629
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
THINKING I'M PREGNANT!

25:29.629 --> 25:31.200
PAGE DR. EDWARDS HERE
STAT.
(woman) RIGHT AWAY.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.531
I NEED AN ULTRASOUND.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.163
ARE YOU PREGNANT?
DOES ALEX KNOW?

25:34.163 --> 25:36.606
NO, I-I NEED
AN ULTRASOUND MACHINE.

25:36.606 --> 25:38.738
HAVE YOU SEEN EDWARDS?
DOES ALEX THINK I'M PREGNANT?

25:41.540 --> 25:43.312
I HAVE A MUG LIKE THAT.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.316
(Derek)
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?

25:47.316 --> 25:49.779
UH, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE LEAVING,

25:49.779 --> 25:51.751
AND DR. YANG AND I FOUND
A LEFT VENTRICLE A.V.M.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.583
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE HERE NOW.
SCRUB IN.

25:53.583 --> 25:54.724
I'D RATHER NOT.

25:54.724 --> 25:55.825
(scrubbing hands,
water trickling)

25:55.825 --> 25:57.887
SHANE, YOU GOTTA GET
PAST THIS.

25:57.887 --> 25:59.558
YOU'RE NOT
A CONSOLATION PRIZE.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.160
YOU DESERVE TO BE HERE.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.593
BROOKS HAD A GIFT
THAT NEEDED TO BE--

26:03.593 --> 26:05.564
I DON'T WANNA WORK
WITH YOU.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.566
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.599
CAN I BE MORE CLEAR?

26:09.599 --> 26:12.571
I SUPPOSE NOT.

26:13.903 --> 26:15.044
GO.

26:15.044 --> 26:18.748
(continues scrubbing hands)

26:18.748 --> 26:20.279
(door creaks)

26:20.279 --> 26:22.581
TO A CERTAIN EXTENT,
TIME WILL TELL.

26:22.581 --> 26:26.315
WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS WE'VE
DONE NO DAMAGE TO YOUR HEART,

26:26.315 --> 26:28.117
AND AT THIS
PRELIMINARY STAGE,

26:28.117 --> 26:32.361
IT APPEARS THE A.V.M.
WON'T CONTINUE TO GROW.

26:32.361 --> 26:34.794
SO YOU'RE SAYING...

26:34.794 --> 26:36.866
I'LL LIVE?

26:36.866 --> 26:38.597
YES.
MM-HMM.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.369
DEAR GOD.
(elevator bell dings)

26:40.369 --> 26:42.231
(inhales deeply)

26:42.231 --> 26:44.203
BEN? HONEY?
(whispers) I KNOW.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.675
WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

26:45.675 --> 26:48.978
I KNOW IT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
IT'S BEEN A CRAZY YEAR,

26:48.978 --> 26:52.141
BUT THE WORLD IS A LOT MORE FUN
WITH YOU IN IT.

26:52.141 --> 26:54.944
AS LONG AS WE HAVE EACH OTHER,
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

26:54.944 --> 26:57.386
JOYCE, WE'RE SCREWED.
I KNOW.

26:57.386 --> 26:59.288
WE'RE NOT JUST BANKRUPT.
WE'RE CRIMINALS.

26:59.288 --> 27:00.289
I THINK WE MIGHT GO
TO JAIL. (crying)

27:00.289 --> 27:02.752
OH, WE'RE SO
INCREDIBLY SCREWED.

27:02.752 --> 27:04.924
LIKE A $2 WHORE.
(continues crying)

27:04.924 --> 27:06.295
(exhales deeply)
(sobbing)

27:06.295 --> 27:08.858
YANG,
THAT'S MY BROKEN ANKLE.

27:08.858 --> 27:10.029
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE HEADS-UP

27:10.029 --> 27:11.861
NEXT TIME YOU WANNA STEAL
ONE OF MY PATIENTS?

27:11.861 --> 27:14.303
(sobbing loudly)

27:14.303 --> 27:16.005
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

27:16.005 --> 27:19.869
I SAVED HIS LIFE.

27:21.370 --> 27:22.742
(sighs)

27:22.742 --> 27:24.373
SO I GET
THAT YOU SAVED HIM,

27:24.373 --> 27:26.415
BUT HE WAS MY PATIENT,
AND YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME

27:26.415 --> 27:29.278
BEFORE YOU D--
I CAME UP WITH THE FIX.
YOU DIDN'T.

27:29.278 --> 27:32.651
IF YOU'RE STILL PISSED ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER NIGHT,

27:32.651 --> 27:35.084
I... I'M WITH JACKSON.

27:35.084 --> 27:37.256
IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE, AND IT'S
NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.958
(lowered voice)
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

27:38.958 --> 27:40.760
(whispers)
WHEN YOU KISSED ME, SHANE.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.762
OH. THAT.

27:42.762 --> 27:45.364
WE WERE EXCITED.
IT HAPPENED.

27:45.364 --> 27:48.197
I'M SORRY IT MEANT MORE
TO YOU--

27:48.197 --> 27:50.369
IT DIDN'T.
YOU'RE STILL TALKING
ABOUT IT.

27:50.369 --> 27:53.272
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU?

27:53.272 --> 27:55.304
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
WHISPERING ABOUT?

27:55.304 --> 27:57.777
NOTHING.
GOD, YOU GUYS, FINE.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.178
IT'S ARIZONA ROBBINS.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.309
BUT PLEASE DON'T SAY
ANYTHING, OKAY?

28:00.309 --> 28:02.411
BECAUSE SHE REALLY DOESN'T
NEED--
ROBBINS?

28:02.411 --> 28:03.713
SO... YOU'RE GAY NOW?

28:03.713 --> 28:06.255
SHANE, GROW UP.
IT'S A SLIDING SCALE.

28:06.255 --> 28:07.416
I SLID OVER HER WAY.

28:07.416 --> 28:08.758
IF YOU REALLY HAVE TO
LABEL EVERYTHING,

28:08.758 --> 28:10.389
THEN LABEL ME "IN LOVE."

28:10.389 --> 28:11.290
(Arizona) MURPHY!

28:11.290 --> 28:13.362
(clears throat)

28:13.362 --> 28:14.693
(woman over P.A.)
DR. MAHONEY TO TRIAGE.

28:14.693 --> 28:16.395
DR. MAHONEY TO TRIAGE.

28:16.395 --> 28:19.228
I'M SORRY. THEY PRETTY MUCH
FIGURED IT OUT.
NO.

28:19.228 --> 28:22.401
I'M SORRY, BECAUSE I'M
ABOUT TO BE VERY FRANK.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.303
THE OTHER NIGHT
WAS A BAD CALL ON MY PART.

28:24.303 --> 28:27.106
I WAS LONELY,
AND IT WAS... LOVELY.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.307
BUT IT WAS--
IT WAS ONE NIGHT,

28:28.307 --> 28:29.879
AND THAT'S ALL
THAT IT WILL EVER BE,

28:29.879 --> 28:31.010
SO IF YOU HAD
DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS,

28:31.010 --> 28:32.341
PLEASE ADJUST THEM.

28:32.341 --> 28:33.342
UH, OF COURSE.

28:33.342 --> 28:36.786
THERE'S NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.
IT'S MY FAULT.

28:36.786 --> 28:38.347
UH...

28:38.347 --> 28:40.289
I DON'T OPEN UP TO PEOPLE
MUCH,

28:40.289 --> 28:42.151
AND WHEN I TRY TO OPEN UP
A LITTLE BIT,

28:42.151 --> 28:45.224
I CAN GET CARRIED AWAY.
IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE.

28:45.224 --> 28:48.457
AND YOU...

28:48.457 --> 28:51.300
I'VE JUST ALWAYS
ADMIRED YOU AS... A SURGEON,

28:51.300 --> 28:52.301
AND--AND A PERSON,

28:52.301 --> 28:55.064
AND THE THOUGHT
THAT YOU THOUGHT ABOUT ME...

28:57.266 --> 28:58.467
I MISUNDERSTOOD.

28:58.467 --> 29:01.440
UM, I WENT OVERBOARD,
AND I'M SORRY.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.172
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.744
LEAH...

29:05.744 --> 29:07.917
(voice breaks) THANK YOU
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

29:07.917 --> 29:10.920
(toilet flushes)

29:10.920 --> 29:13.923
(indistinct conversations)

29:15.985 --> 29:17.887
GIN, ROCKS.
(glass clinks)

29:17.887 --> 29:19.128
YOU GONNA CHARGE ME AGAIN?

29:19.128 --> 29:21.991
MOST PLACES COMP THE BANDS,
YOU KNOW?

29:21.991 --> 29:23.492
I GOT THIS ONE.

29:23.492 --> 29:25.534
APPRECIATE THAT.

29:25.534 --> 29:26.936
JIMMY EVANS.

29:26.936 --> 29:28.868
HEY.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.041
I KNOW YOU.

29:35.104 --> 29:37.176
I'VE, UH, BEEN HERE
THE LAST COUPLE OF NIGHTS.

29:37.176 --> 29:40.179
NO. SOMETHING ELSE.

29:45.184 --> 29:46.285
OH, MY GOD.

29:48.117 --> 29:49.418
YOU'RE A DOCTOR...

29:49.418 --> 29:51.060
AT THE HOSPITAL.

29:51.060 --> 29:52.261
GUILTY.

29:52.261 --> 29:55.464
(chuckles) WHAT BRINGS YOU
BACK HERE EVERY NIGHT?

29:55.464 --> 29:57.997
OH, UH, YOU.
I MEAN, I LIKE YOUR SET.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.469
UH, I LIKE
THE ALBERT COLLINS STUFF.

30:00.469 --> 30:02.832
AH. YOU GOT A GOOD EAR, THEN.
YOU PLAY?

30:02.832 --> 30:05.274
MY DAD TAUGHT ME A LITTLE
WHEN I WAS A KID,

30:05.274 --> 30:07.206
BUT, UH, HE DIDN'T STICK
WITH IT.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.238
AW, YOU SHOULD HAVE
STUCK WITH IT.

30:09.238 --> 30:10.439
LOOK WHERE IT COULD'VE
TAKEN YOU.

30:10.439 --> 30:12.381
I MEAN, INSTEAD OF
SAVING PEOPLE'S LIVES,

30:12.381 --> 30:13.943
YOU COULD BE PLAYING
70-YEAR-OLD SONGS

30:13.943 --> 30:16.485
TO FOUR PEOPLE
IN A GIANT ASHTRAY.

30:16.485 --> 30:19.989

30:19.989 --> 30:21.420

30:21.420 --> 30:24.293
(exhales) WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR
ARE YOU?
(sets down glass)

30:24.293 --> 30:26.495
OH. PEDIATRIC SURGEON.

30:26.495 --> 30:28.257
UH, BABIES, KIDS.

30:28.257 --> 30:31.100
I MET
A PEDIATRIC SURGEON ONCE.

30:31.100 --> 30:33.302
SCARIEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

30:33.302 --> 30:36.205
MY SON'S NOT EVEN
2 YEARS OLD.

30:36.205 --> 30:39.138
I'M FEEDING HIM STRAWBERRIES,
AND HE STARTS CHOKING.

30:39.138 --> 30:41.370
TURNED BLUE.

30:41.370 --> 30:43.442
WE TAKE HIM IN,
THEY GET HIM BREATHING AGAIN.

30:43.442 --> 30:47.216
PEDIATRIC SURGEON RUNS
THE TUBE DOWN HIS THROAT,

30:47.216 --> 30:48.918
AND GOT THE THING OUT.

30:48.918 --> 30:52.381
SAVED MY BOY'S LIFE.
SAVED MY LIFE, TOO.

30:52.381 --> 30:55.054
IF I'D LOST MY LITTLE BOY
THAT NIGHT,

30:55.054 --> 30:58.427
I NEVER WOULD'VE MADE IT.
I NEVER WOULD'VE SURVIVED.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.892
I'M GLAD IT WORKED OUT
FOR YOU.

31:02.892 --> 31:06.495
YEAH. THANK GOD
FOR YOU GUYS, MAN. SERIOUSLY.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.939
SO WHERE IS HE?

31:09.939 --> 31:12.171
NOW, I MEAN.
WHERE'S YOUR FAMILY?

31:12.171 --> 31:14.643
(exhales deeply)
THAT'S A COMPLICATED ANSWER.

31:17.176 --> 31:20.309
(exhales deeply) THIS PLACE
HAS REALLY CLEARED OUT.

31:20.309 --> 31:22.181
I GUESS
I WAS THE BIG DRAW.

31:23.412 --> 31:25.184
YEAH, WELL... (sighs)

31:25.184 --> 31:27.586
I PROBABLY SHOULD HEAD OUT
MYSELF.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.418
I WAS GONNA SAY,
YOU PLAY A LITTLE?

31:29.418 --> 31:30.489
I GOT AN EXTRA GUITAR.

31:30.489 --> 31:31.660
WE CAN GET UP
AND MAKE SOME NOISE.

31:31.660 --> 31:34.263
NO. NO, I HAVEN'T PLAYED
SINCE I WAS A KID.

31:34.263 --> 31:36.525
WELL, THERE'S NO ONE HERE
