00:01.917 --> 00:03.792
I couldn't sleep at all
last night

00:03.875 --> 00:05.709
after finding out
Skylar's evil now.

00:05.792 --> 00:07.375
Mostly because you kept
calling me

00:07.458 --> 00:08.709
every five minutes
and saying,

00:08.792 --> 00:11.375
"I can't believe
Skylar's evil now."

00:11.458 --> 00:12.667
(phone ringing)

00:12.750 --> 00:13.917
Hello?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.125
I can't believe
Skylar's evil now.

00:19.458 --> 00:20.875
Alan?

00:20.959 --> 00:22.667
What are you
doing here?

00:22.750 --> 00:24.542
Well, since
I'm half-Normo,

00:24.625 --> 00:27.166
I figured I'd go to school
to embrace my Normo roots.

00:27.250 --> 00:30.583
I'll bet I'll be
the most popular kid here,

00:30.667 --> 00:32.667
if I can keep my temper
somewhat in check.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.500
You'll never be able
to keep your temper in check.

00:34.583 --> 00:35.792
I said somewhat in check!

00:39.375 --> 00:40.834
I also spent
the weekend

00:40.917 --> 00:42.792
watching high school movies
for research

00:42.875 --> 00:44.792
so I've got this whole thing
figured out.

00:44.875 --> 00:47.333
Oh. Now,
what time do students

00:47.417 --> 00:48.834
suddenly break
into song and dance

00:48.917 --> 00:50.458
for no apparent reason?

00:52.125 --> 00:54.834
Alan, that doesn't happen
in real high school.

00:58.917 --> 01:01.333

01:01.417 --> 01:03.458

01:10.834 --> 01:12.500
Hey, wait up for me.

01:17.750 --> 01:19.917
So what are we gonna do
about Skylar?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.542
I don't know, but we cannot let her
find out that we know she's evil,

01:22.625 --> 01:24.291
or we'll end up as statues
like Blaylock.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.291
No, I cannot
become a statue.

01:26.375 --> 01:29.458
You know, I get antsy if I stand around
in one spot for too long.

01:29.542 --> 01:30.458
Hey, guys.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.208
Skylar,

01:33.291 --> 01:34.750
surprised to see you
at school

01:34.834 --> 01:36.417
now they have
your powers back

01:36.500 --> 01:38.834
and can fight for life,
liberty and justice

01:38.917 --> 01:41.000
but mostly life.

01:41.083 --> 01:43.125
Oh, I just have
a few things here

01:43.208 --> 01:44.208
that I need to tie up.

01:44.291 --> 01:46.709
Like hostages?

01:49.291 --> 01:52.166
Actually, there's something
that I need to do.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.333
This is really hard for me...

01:54.417 --> 01:55.792
Then don't do it.

01:55.875 --> 01:57.458
That's always
the best policy.

01:57.542 --> 01:58.917
In fact, if I had
a sneaker company,

01:59.000 --> 02:02.625
that would be its slogan:
"Just don't do it."

02:02.709 --> 02:05.166
But if I don't do it now,
then I never will.

02:07.583 --> 02:10.000
Oliver, would you like to go to
the school dance with me tonight?

02:10.083 --> 02:12.750
Of course, I would love to go
to the dance with you.

This dance is going to be
so much fun.

03:05.041 --> 03:06.500
I'm going to go
pick up my dress.

03:06.583 --> 03:09.500
When you see it,
you are going to die.

03:10.667 --> 03:11.750
(school bell ringing)

03:13.000 --> 03:14.500
What are you doing?

03:14.583 --> 03:16.166
You can't go to the dance
with Skylar.

03:16.250 --> 03:18.333
You might as well just go
with Megahertz.

03:18.417 --> 03:20.792
It's not the same thing
at all.

03:20.875 --> 03:22.333
First, Megahertz
wouldn't look

03:22.417 --> 03:23.709
nearly as good
in a party dress.

03:23.792 --> 03:27.500
And second,
he didn't invite me.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.041
My point is, you're letting
your feelings for Skylar

03:30.125 --> 03:31.750
cloud your judgment.

03:31.834 --> 03:33.750
Actual...

03:33.834 --> 03:37.166
Actually, I'm starting to think
that Skylar isn't a villain after all.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.250
I mean, if she's evil,

03:39.333 --> 03:41.125
then why didn't she just
explode me on the spot

03:41.208 --> 03:42.709
instead of inviting me
to the dance?

03:42.792 --> 03:44.875
Did somebody say dance?

03:55.041 --> 03:57.709
Skylar probably
didn't want to raise suspicion.

03:57.792 --> 04:00.166
Besides, Skylar asking
you to the dance

04:00.250 --> 04:02.792
is the biggest proof
yet that she's a villain.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.041
Think about it,

04:04.125 --> 04:07.959
a pretty girl just asked you
to be her date.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.250
You.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.750
Does that make sense?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.834
I'll have you know
that I've been called

04:15.917 --> 04:17.375
"unconventionally handsome."

04:17.458 --> 04:19.041
By your mom.

04:20.375 --> 04:22.667
Who said it is not important.

04:22.750 --> 04:25.208
Look, I know Skylar
better than anyone,

04:25.291 --> 04:26.667
and I'm telling you,
she's not evil.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.041
I can sense it.

04:28.125 --> 04:30.792
You know what, fine. Okay.
I'll just have to prove you wrong.

04:30.875 --> 04:32.375
I'm gonna go down
to Mighty Max,

04:32.458 --> 04:33.792
spy on the Annihilator,

04:33.875 --> 04:36.083
and get proof
that Skylar is evil.

04:36.166 --> 04:38.667
And how do you plan
on getting into Mighty Max?

04:38.750 --> 04:40.166
They tightened security
like crazy.

04:40.250 --> 04:41.875
And you can't tell anyone
why you're going,

04:41.959 --> 04:43.458
because we don't know
who we can trust.

04:44.500 --> 04:45.834
Don't worry.

04:45.917 --> 04:47.792
I've already
figured out a way in.

04:47.875 --> 04:50.041
Listen up everyone!

04:50.125 --> 04:52.750
I'm the villain...
uh...

04:52.834 --> 04:56.041
No-Name...

04:56.125 --> 04:59.041
and I'm here to destroy you all
and there's no way I can be stopped!

04:59.125 --> 05:01.458
-Stop.
-Okay, I give up.

05:04.375 --> 05:05.792
Why are you so shocked?

05:05.875 --> 05:07.083
I'm not shocked.

05:10.792 --> 05:12.125
You are now.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.417
I love my new job.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.083
(groans,
screams)

05:22.709 --> 05:26.583
Okay, what's the best way
for me to fit in here?

05:26.667 --> 05:29.333
Well, you can try
going in sideways like this.

05:31.458 --> 05:32.834
That's not what I meant!

05:36.667 --> 05:38.667
Thank you for your
valuable advice.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.500
Check it out. I just set up
the greatest prank on Gus.

05:45.583 --> 05:46.709
I can totally
get back at him

05:46.792 --> 05:47.834
for what he's been
doing to me

05:47.917 --> 05:49.750
all these years:

05:49.834 --> 05:51.583
existing.

05:52.792 --> 05:54.792
See?
He's doing it again.

05:56.709 --> 05:59.750
Anyway, I completely
filled his locker with popcorn.

05:59.834 --> 06:00.792
Watch.

06:05.041 --> 06:07.291
Hmm, I don't remember bringing

06:07.375 --> 06:10.792
dozens of unpopped microwave
popcorn bags to school today.

06:10.875 --> 06:14.875
Yesterday, yes,
but today, no.

06:14.959 --> 06:16.583
Wait for it...

06:17.917 --> 06:19.125
(electronic tone)

06:28.125 --> 06:29.834
It missed Gus?

06:29.917 --> 06:31.792
Ohh! Do you know
how hard it is

06:31.875 --> 06:33.041
to turn the inside
of a locker

06:33.125 --> 06:36.041
into a nuclear-powered
microwave?

06:37.083 --> 06:38.792
Alan, are you okay?

06:44.125 --> 06:46.583
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:46.667 --> 06:49.417
I'm just covered in
fresh hot popcorn...

06:49.500 --> 06:50.875
emphasis on "hot."

06:52.875 --> 06:54.041
Here, I can help.

07:03.792 --> 07:05.917
There.
Much better.

07:13.917 --> 07:15.875
Hey, since
I'm super evil,

07:15.959 --> 07:17.625
you should probably
lock me up with someone

07:17.709 --> 07:19.667
who's just as evil as I am.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.667
Like the Annihilator.

07:21.750 --> 07:24.583
That would really
teach me a lesson.

07:25.792 --> 07:29.250
Well, if that would
make you happy...

07:29.333 --> 07:30.750
then forget it!

07:33.917 --> 07:34.875
Get in there.

07:36.750 --> 07:40.834
(Together) Well, well, well...

07:40.917 --> 07:43.875
Seems like we got ourselves
a new roommate.

07:43.959 --> 07:46.625
Wait, you look familiar.

07:46.709 --> 07:48.458
Yeah, do we know
you from somewhere?

07:48.542 --> 07:49.834
Let's play
Villain Geography.

07:49.917 --> 07:52.250
Where did you go to camp?

07:52.333 --> 07:54.667
Uh...you don't know me.

07:54.750 --> 07:57.000
I'm the villain,
No-Name.

07:57.083 --> 07:58.583
Not a teenage boy
you'd see

07:58.667 --> 08:00.834
just about every day
at a comic book store.

08:03.166 --> 08:05.834
So what are you in for?

08:05.917 --> 08:09.917
Whatever would scare you
the most, that's what I did!

08:10.000 --> 08:11.750
You tore one of those

08:11.834 --> 08:13.875
"do not remove" tags
off a mattress?!

08:14.917 --> 08:15.750
Ripped it right off!

08:15.834 --> 08:16.792
You monster!

08:16.875 --> 08:18.166
Please don't hurt us!

08:19.792 --> 08:21.000
Right, I won't hurt you

08:21.083 --> 08:23.417
if you tell me everything
you've heard

08:23.500 --> 08:24.959
in here about the Annihilator.

08:25.041 --> 08:27.375
Okay, we overheard him
in the cafeteria.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.166
Of course, he sits
at the cool villains' table.

08:31.083 --> 08:34.125
Anyway, he's working
with someone in Mighty Med

08:34.208 --> 08:36.291
and you're never gonna
guess who.

08:36.375 --> 08:37.583
Skylar Storm.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.792
I was talking to him.

08:39.875 --> 08:41.959
This is why we don't sit
at the cool table.

08:48.750 --> 08:50.750
Oh, hey, Skylar.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.083
I was thinking we should arrive
at the dance looking cool,

08:53.166 --> 08:55.750
so I asked my mom
to drive us in the nice minivan.

08:55.834 --> 08:57.709
I'm way ahead of you.

08:57.792 --> 09:00.291
I ordered us
a stretch limo.

09:00.375 --> 09:01.375
Really?

09:01.458 --> 09:03.458
Awesome!

09:03.542 --> 09:05.750
My mom will be disappointed,
but, awesome!

09:06.875 --> 09:08.625
What do you think?

09:08.709 --> 09:10.208
Fancy, huh?

09:10.291 --> 09:12.166
That's a hearse...

09:14.667 --> 09:16.166
for a funeral...

09:17.583 --> 09:19.709
for dead people.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.125
I don't think so.

09:21.208 --> 09:23.542
See? In the back,
there's a disco ball.

09:26.291 --> 09:27.792
That's a bone saw.

09:29.750 --> 09:30.917
Huh.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.959
Anyway, I thought
we'd go out to dinner first.

09:35.041 --> 09:38.250
What would you pick to eat
if you could only have one last meal,

09:38.333 --> 09:41.291
because you knew that
it was your final night 1on Earth?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.875
-(cell phone ringing)
-Ah!

09:45.959 --> 09:47.375
(nervous chuckle)

09:47.458 --> 09:50.041
Would you, uh... excuse me

09:50.125 --> 09:52.250
for...a minute?

09:55.500 --> 09:58.208
-(cell phone ringing)
-Hello.

09:58.291 --> 10:00.750
Oliver, okay,
I only get one phone call

10:00.834 --> 10:02.959
and it can only last for three minutes.

10:03.041 --> 10:05.750
I was wrong about Skylar.
She isn't gonna kill us.

10:05.834 --> 10:07.583
(relieved sigh)
Thank goodness.

10:07.667 --> 10:09.834
I was starting to think
you were right.

10:09.917 --> 10:12.500
Nope. Turns out she's only gonna kill you.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.667
Tonight.
At the dance.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.875
Hey, I have two minutes left
on my phone privileges.

10:18.959 --> 10:22.083
So...whatcha doin'?

10:28.333 --> 10:32.792
I don't understand. Why is Skylar gonna
destroy me and not you?

10:32.875 --> 10:35.750
I pretend to listen
to her feelings for hours.

10:35.834 --> 10:37.792
Maybe the Annihilator thinks

10:37.875 --> 10:41.250
that if we both end up dead,
it will look too suspicious,

10:41.333 --> 10:43.417
so I guess
he's going after you.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.959
Hey, buddy,
don't feel left out.

10:46.041 --> 10:47.959
Yeah, you're gonna be
blown to bits

10:48.041 --> 10:50.834
when the Annihilator completely wipes out
the entire city on Sunday.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.583
Sunday?
Why not Monday?

10:53.667 --> 10:55.333
Yeah, no one
likes Mondays.

10:57.375 --> 10:59.250
There's got to be something
we could do.

10:59.333 --> 11:02.667
Well, my sources tell me
there is one way to stop Skylar

11:02.750 --> 11:04.834
and that's with true love's kiss.

11:04.917 --> 11:07.917
And since you truly love her,
that means a kiss from you.

11:08.041 --> 11:09.583
What?

11:09.667 --> 11:12.125
Are you saying that
if I kiss Skylar,

11:12.208 --> 11:14.917
it will break the Annihilator's
spell and make her not evil?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.709
No. That's crazy.

11:17.792 --> 11:20.834
I'm saying that
if you kiss her, she'll die.

11:20.917 --> 11:23.458
No, no, no. There's got to be
some other way.

11:23.542 --> 11:25.834
-Is there any other way?
-(Together) Nope.

11:27.750 --> 11:28.875
Listen...

11:28.959 --> 11:31.500
you have to do it,
or she'll destroy the city

11:31.583 --> 11:33.375
and take out millions of people.

11:33.458 --> 11:35.834
You're the only one
in the position to stop her.

11:37.750 --> 11:39.208
I guess I have no choice.

11:41.125 --> 11:42.709
If it makes you feel any better,

11:42.792 --> 11:44.917
if you ever kissed Skylar,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.875
she'd probably die
of embarrassment anyway.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.667
Uh, yeah, you know,

11:57.750 --> 12:01.166
hearing you repeat that
true love's kiss thing out loud,

12:01.250 --> 12:03.208
I think we're misremembering
something.

12:03.291 --> 12:05.291
Yeah, the Annihilator
didn't say that.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.875
That was the plot of Sleeping Beauty.

12:08.750 --> 12:10.917
-Well, no biggie.
-What?!

12:11.000 --> 12:13.375
Yes biggie!

12:13.458 --> 12:16.500
Fine. The Annihilator said
that he gave Skylar

12:16.583 --> 12:19.417
the ability to drain the life force
out of people with her mouth.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.834
So if she kisses your friend,
your friend will die.

12:21.917 --> 12:23.834
How did we confuse that
with Sleeping Beauty?

12:23.917 --> 12:26.834
Wake with a kiss,
die with a kiss.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.000
They're kind of similar.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.709
They're very similar.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.000
Philip, I need to make
another phone call.

12:33.083 --> 12:35.750
Oh, I've heard that one before.

12:35.834 --> 12:38.834
It's true.
We also needed to make another phone call.

12:39.834 --> 12:40.917
No, you don't understand.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.333
I'm not actually a villain.

12:42.417 --> 12:44.750
It's me, Kaz.

12:44.834 --> 12:47.542
Oh, I've heard that one before.

12:47.625 --> 12:50.792
-It's true.
-We also said that we were Kaz.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.083
Alan! Alan! Why didn't you
return my calls?

13:02.166 --> 13:04.417
-When did you call me?
-Just a second ago.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.542
I called out, "Alan! Alan!"

13:07.750 --> 13:10.834
Listen, I found out it was Jordan
who pulled that prank.

13:10.917 --> 13:13.333
All that popcorn
was meant for me.

13:13.417 --> 13:16.458
Unlike me, she is not very nice.

13:16.542 --> 13:20.625
No, but to Jordan's credit,
she does return my calls.

13:20.709 --> 13:23.041
Watch.
Jordan! Jordan!

13:23.125 --> 13:24.291
Go away!

13:24.375 --> 13:25.542
See?

13:26.750 --> 13:30.083
Anyway, I've set up a great prank
so we can get her back.

13:30.166 --> 13:31.792
I don't want
to pull pranks.

13:31.875 --> 13:34.709
I'm trying to become popular
by doing typical high school things,

13:34.792 --> 13:38.625
like dating a vampire
or befriending a wizard.

13:39.792 --> 13:41.500
Well, you can't
back out now.

13:41.583 --> 13:42.792
You're already in too deep.

13:45.333 --> 13:46.709
What's that?

13:46.792 --> 13:49.709
This?
This controls that.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.875
A huge version
of an arcade claw machine

13:52.959 --> 13:55.125
that grabs
stuffed animals.

13:55.208 --> 13:57.041
Where in the world
did you get it?

13:57.125 --> 13:58.208
My uncle installed it.

13:58.291 --> 14:00.583
He's an inventor
of extremely large things

14:00.667 --> 14:02.250
that are usually much smaller.

14:03.458 --> 14:04.750
He also gave me this bandage.

14:10.375 --> 14:11.750
So here's the prank.

14:11.834 --> 14:13.709
Jordan loves that hat,

14:13.792 --> 14:16.583
and we're going to use this
to steal it.

14:16.667 --> 14:19.792
Wouldn't it be easier to just
walk over and take her hat?

14:19.875 --> 14:22.041
That seems
like a lot of work.

14:28.291 --> 14:32.458
I'm having some trouble
working these controls.

14:34.917 --> 14:35.917
Uhh!

14:39.917 --> 14:42.834
Huh. Well, that's not right.

14:42.917 --> 14:44.667
Help me!

14:49.583 --> 14:51.583
Gus, put me down!

14:52.625 --> 14:53.542
Aaah!

14:53.625 --> 14:55.625
(groaning)

14:55.709 --> 14:58.166
Alan, are you okay?

14:59.417 --> 15:01.208
Do you need a bandage?

15:02.583 --> 15:03.875
(muttering angrily)

15:19.208 --> 15:22.542
(Oliver) I know she's evil,
but I don't want her to die.

15:22.625 --> 15:24.000
I love her.

15:24.083 --> 15:27.166
(Skylar) I know I'm evil,
but I don't want him to die.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.083
I love him.

15:29.166 --> 15:30.583
Uh, like a friend.

15:30.667 --> 15:32.625
I don't want there to be
any confusion,

15:32.709 --> 15:35.208
in case anyone here
can read my mind.

15:35.291 --> 15:37.834
In which case:
I'm totally not evil.

15:39.917 --> 15:42.750
Hey, uh, listen.

15:42.834 --> 15:46.417
Things are gonna be different
now that you have your powers back, and...

15:46.500 --> 15:49.959
I just want you to know
that whatever happens...

15:50.041 --> 15:52.000
I'll never forget you.

15:53.125 --> 15:54.792
I won't forget you either.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.542
Uh, would you excuse me?

16:01.625 --> 16:04.834
I think I need to go sit down...
on a toilet.

16:12.375 --> 16:14.458
Is it done?
Did you finish off Oliver?

16:14.542 --> 16:15.750
What, no "hello?"

16:15.834 --> 16:17.208
No "how was the dance?"

16:18.750 --> 16:20.917
Listen, I've been thinking.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.250
Oliver's not a threat to us,
so I don't need to get rid of him.

16:24.375 --> 16:25.792
I gave you an order!

16:25.875 --> 16:27.667
But Oliver
doesn't know anything.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.583
He's not dangerous.

16:29.667 --> 16:30.709
Except when he dances.

16:30.792 --> 16:32.875
Arms everywhere!

16:34.875 --> 16:37.250
Those boys keep interfering
with my plans.

16:37.333 --> 16:40.375
And Oliver's making you weak
and sentimental.

16:40.458 --> 16:44.041
So finish him,
or I'll finish you and then him.

16:45.041 --> 16:46.333
Fine.

16:48.583 --> 16:51.458
Have fun. Make evil choices.

16:54.125 --> 16:57.709
Philip, please,
I need to use that phone again!

16:57.792 --> 17:01.875
You can't, Not Kaz,
because it's broken.

17:01.959 --> 17:03.792
No, it's not.
I just used it.

17:08.709 --> 17:09.875
It is now.

17:09.959 --> 17:11.875
I love my new job.

17:11.959 --> 17:14.709
Philip, you have
to believe me, I'm Kaz.

17:14.792 --> 17:16.959
And I know that somewhere
inside that giant head of yours

17:17.041 --> 17:18.542
is a shred of common sense.

17:18.625 --> 17:20.291
So please, let me out.

17:20.375 --> 17:22.792
I have to get to Oliver.
His life is at stake.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.875
You said all I needed to hear...

17:25.959 --> 17:28.000
that my head was giant.

17:29.875 --> 17:32.750
Only the real Kaz would know
how much that means to me.

17:34.709 --> 17:35.792
Thank you.

17:35.875 --> 17:37.625
We should probably go, too.

17:37.709 --> 17:40.583
Yes, because,
we are also the real Kaz.

17:40.667 --> 17:43.291
-Aaah!
-Aaah!

17:43.375 --> 17:45.917
All right, guess who's not getting
a Christmas card from us?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.834
-Philip?
-Will you stop it?

17:47.917 --> 17:50.041
I was talking to him!

18:00.834 --> 18:04.625
(Oliver) I know she looks
beautiful, smells beautiful,

18:04.709 --> 18:06.166
but she's evil.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.750
I have to do this,

18:07.834 --> 18:10.667
to save the city and the world.

18:10.750 --> 18:15.166
(Skylar) I know he's not beautiful,
and doesn't smell beautiful,

18:15.250 --> 18:16.709
but I'm evil.

18:16.792 --> 18:21.917
I have to do this,
to destroy the city and the world.

18:23.125 --> 18:26.875
Hey, Alan, I'm so sorry
about the popcorn this morning.

18:26.959 --> 18:29.083
That prank was meant for Gus.

18:29.166 --> 18:31.834
I'm not angry.
No need to apologize.

18:31.917 --> 18:33.917
It's all just
high school hijinks.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.834
In fact, I feel a song coming on.

18:36.917 --> 18:39.250
♪ High school hijinks ♪

18:39.333 --> 18:41.875
♪ Cool friends,
cool drinks ♪

18:44.500 --> 18:46.125
That's really good.

18:50.709 --> 18:54.041
I must have snagged a tiny bit of thread
on your sweater with my mood ring,

18:54.125 --> 18:57.125
which is always dark,
because my mood ring gets me.

19:03.417 --> 19:05.417
What?!!!

19:07.250 --> 19:09.834
I can't take it anymore!

19:13.750 --> 19:15.500
Aaaah!

19:16.667 --> 19:17.834
(pig oinking)

19:28.834 --> 19:32.750
Part of me wants to kiss you,
and part of me doesn't.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.709
I know how you feel.

19:35.792 --> 19:38.375
Part of me also doesn't want to.

19:38.458 --> 19:39.792
Mostly my lips.

19:41.875 --> 19:43.667
I have to do this.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.500
-I'm sorry.
-Me too.

19:49.542 --> 19:50.709
(loud oinking)

20:05.709 --> 20:07.834
There you are. Is it done?

20:10.250 --> 20:12.250
It's done.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.959
-Oliver's dead.
-Excellent.

20:15.041 --> 20:18.000
Wait till they hear about this
at the cool villains' table.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.291
Kaz, you were right.

20:24.375 --> 20:27.250
I did let my feelings
for Skylar cloud my judgment.

20:27.333 --> 20:30.125
-So I was this close to dying?
-Yup.

20:30.208 --> 20:33.458
Pretty much your inability to get
any woman to ever kiss you

20:33.542 --> 20:35.875
actually saved your life.

20:35.959 --> 20:38.083
You should be grateful
you're not irresistible.

20:38.166 --> 20:40.583
Ohh. I would be so dead.

20:40.667 --> 20:43.000
Look, we have to figure out
how to stop Skylar

20:43.083 --> 20:45.166
and the Annihilator
from destroying the city.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.875
Or we could just
move to New York.

20:47.959 --> 20:50.166
I do love bagels.

20:53.667 --> 20:56.834
Alan, that thing with the pig...

20:56.917 --> 20:58.709
did you do what I think you did?

20:58.792 --> 21:01.750
-Um, I...
-You stole our rival school mascot

21:01.834 --> 21:03.542
and put it in a sweater vest?

21:03.625 --> 21:04.834
That's hilarious!

21:04.917 --> 21:06.500
He usually wears a sports jacket.

21:07.709 --> 21:10.041
Greatest prank in history!

21:10.125 --> 21:13.125
All hail Alan, King of Pranks.

21:13.208 --> 21:16.125
