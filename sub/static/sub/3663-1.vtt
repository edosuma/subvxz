13:26.145 --> 13:27.980
It's already the third round.

13:28.439 --> 13:30.733
You turn a hundred rounds you will not find cheaper than this.

13:32.110 --> 13:33.486
Mothers of children!

13:38.533 --> 13:41.285
The door opens so on to where?

13:44.956 --> 13:46.332
Mom!

13:49.085 --> 13:50.461
Mom!

13:50.461 --> 13:50.920
- = Space Operations = - Mom!

13:50.920 --> 13:51.838
- = Operating Room = -

13:55.967 --> 14:00.096
Geez, what happened?

14:01.931 --> 14:03.307
Wife, are you all right?

14:03.766 --> 14:05.143
Holders minum?

14:05.143 --> 14:07.437
Eomonie...

14:07.437 --> 14:09.272
What did you say? Repeat it once again.

14:11.107 --> 14:13.401
Eomonie? Eomonie kenapa?

14:14.318 --> 14:16.612
Children's mother wanted to see me?

14:17.989 --> 14:20.283
What is it? I'm here.

14:20.283 --> 14:21.659
Eomonie...

14:22.118 --> 14:23.036
What is it?

14:25.788 --> 14:27.165
He asked you out.

14:34.505 --> 14:38.176
Do not worry. Okay operating results.

14:38.634 --> 14:39.552
Thank you.

14:39.552 --> 14:43.222
Anyway, if you do not want to be a single man, keep the good wife.

14:43.222 --> 14:45.975
If deteriorate, should be held thoracic surgery.

14:46.893 --> 14:48.728
Want to watch how?

14:48.728 --> 14:51.481
What if he drove to his parents' house to rest a few months?

14:51.481 --> 14:54.233
Recovery was nothing more than eating and adequate rest.

14:54.233 --> 14:56.069
My wife does not have parents.

14:57.445 --> 14:59.739
The only man left in-law died last year.

14:59.739 --> 15:03.868
So what to do? If he has to constantly depressed, it is not good for his health.

15:07.997 --> 15:09.374
You do not consider the mother?

15:09.374 --> 15:11.209
Because of grandmother, mother nearly died.

15:11.209 --> 15:14.420
Still should not be so. However grandmother should not be dropping it into place.

15:14.420 --> 15:16.255
Why memagnnya the nursing home?

15:16.255 --> 15:19.008
Nursing homes now have good facilities and nutritious food.

15:19.008 --> 15:21.302
For parents like grandma, it's a much nicer place than home.

15:21.302 --> 15:23.596
Okay, what if you are there to Ban Ha Na?

15:24.972 --> 15:26.349
Grandma!

15:27.725 --> 15:29.560
Eomonie, have gone home?

15:30.478 --> 15:33.231

15:35.983 --> 15:37.360
Eomonie!

15:55.712 --> 15:57.088

15:58.006 --> 15:59.841
He said he was busy training.

16:06.264 --> 16:08.558
Emonie, eat a lot!

16:08.558 --> 16:11.311
No, you are supposed to eat more.

16:12.687 --> 16:14.522
I'm full.

16:14.522 --> 16:15.898
You also eat a lot.

16:16.816 --> 16:17.734
All right.

16:19.110 --> 16:23.239
Eomonie, after the children's mother's condition has improved, I'll soon get you home.

16:25.533 --> 16:27.368
Well-okay on your wife.

16:28.745 --> 16:32.415
If she gets sick again, there was no one else to blame.

16:33.333 --> 16:37.462
Aigoo, until charred flesh. Too bad ... Please replace the fire!

16:41.132 --> 16:43.426
Young kenapa?

16:43.426 --> 16:46.638
If you are not feeling well, go home and rest.

16:47.096 --> 16:48.473
Conditions terrible-law?

16:48.473 --> 16:50.308
Oh my God ...

16:50.767 --> 16:53.978

17:03.613 --> 17:05.448
You really do not remember me anymore?

17:05.448 --> 17:06.366
Not so ...

17:06.366 --> 17:08.660
Why can you not remember me anymore?

17:08.660 --> 17:11.871
Thanks eonnie, I can enjoy a good life.

17:11.871 --> 17:16.000
You seem to have such great debt of gratitude to Our Lady.

17:16.459 --> 17:21.047
Debt of gratitude? Debt of gratitude is so great.

17:21.964 --> 17:26.094
By the time you and your newborn son had no place to stay, my mother who has been keeping you guys.

17:26.094 --> 17:29.305
Give you a job at the hotel, feed you and shelter.

17:32.058 --> 17:34.352

17:34.811 --> 17:37.563

17:37.563 --> 17:42.151
Eldest daughter of the restaurant owner Sinheung chu-eo-tang that eonnie make it bankrupt.

17:44.904 --> 17:48.116
Looks like you're one person.

17:48.116 --> 17:49.951
Where possible I have the wrong person?

17:50.410 --> 17:53.621
How could I ever forget, eonnie we please, steal secret soup recipes our family.

17:53.621 --> 17:56.833

17:57.750 --> 17:59.586
I'll go first.

18:01.879 --> 18:03.256
Where can you get away with it?

18:03.256 --> 18:06.009
After hearing the news about you yesterday, I could not sleep all night.

18:06.009 --> 18:08.303
Why is this? I had to go home.

18:08.303 --> 18:10.138
Holders of another?

18:10.138 --> 18:12.432
This problem must be solved today.

18:12.432 --> 18:13.808
Every day I pray.

18:13.808 --> 18:14.726
Aigoo, Aigoo! Not so.

18:14.726 --> 18:17.020
Pray that I can see you again.

18:17.020 --> 18:17.937
Move you!

18:17.937 --> 18:21.149
My mother with anger, fell ill.

18:21.149 --> 18:23.443
Before the last breath, he continued to shout.

18:23.443 --> 18:24.360

18:44.088 --> 18:45.465

My son is a faculty member.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.781

19:09.781 --> 19:12.992
Who is better at it than me in terms of teaching children, come out!

Do not always quarreled with nuna.

20:20.894 --> 20:23.646
Grandma, I want to eat fried chicken.

20:24.564 --> 20:26.399
The fried chicken was too oily.

20:26.399 --> 20:29.152
Grandma knew a delicious stewed chicken restaurant.

20:29.152 --> 20:32.363
= Chicken stew? Can. =

20:33.281 --> 20:36.493

21:15.949 --> 21:21.454
Photos on display outside of it was a picture of Audrey Hepburn, right?

21:21.454 --> 21:22.831
Possess.

21:23.748 --> 21:30.171
That's what the movie was that a daughter had run away with a man.

21:30.171 --> 21:31.089
Roman Holiday?

21:31.089 --> 21:32.924
Iya, Roman Holiday.

21:32.924 --> 21:35.677
Of all the artists I know, she is the most beautiful.

Oh ya?

21:39.347 --> 21:42.559

21:49.899 --> 21:52.193
Audrey Hepburn is dead?

21:52.652 --> 21:55.864
Yes, twenty years had passed over.

22:00.452 --> 22:06.416
When you were young, you also certainly as beautiful as Audrey Hepburn.

Honestly, once so said I was the daughter of the family Oh, Oh Mal Soon,

22:15.592 --> 22:19.721
Not one man in Boseong who do not know me.

22:19.721 --> 22:22.015
Plus I was smart to sing.

22:22.015 --> 22:24.309

22:27.979 --> 22:30.732
He said I had a vocal, facial, and body of a female vocalist.

22:30.732 --> 22:33.026
He said I was a package or something.

22:33.026 --> 22:35.779
Even now you still look like a lady.

22:37.614 --> 22:41.743
That's why I wanted to photograph now. Before grew ugly.

27:30.323 --> 27:32.617
This is not a photo studio?

27:33.076 --> 27:35.829
Do you think this place looks like a photo studio?

27:36.746 --> 27:43.169
If so, do you know around here there is a photo studio called Cheongchun?

27:43.169 --> 27:44.546
True there are around here.

27:44.546 --> 27:45.922
Agassi...

27:45.922 --> 27:48.675
It's been 10 years I opened the restaurant business here.

27:48.675 --> 27:51.428
Near here is absolutely no photographic studio.

27:52.804 --> 27:56.016
Aigoo, aigoo, how now? Why is that weird?

27:56.016 --> 27:58.310

28:07.944 --> 28:09.779
There was no mistaking this place.

28:16.203 --> 28:18.496
Agassi did not go home?

28:18.496 --> 28:20.332
True he is not here?

28:20.332 --> 28:23.084
Why do not you tell me clearly. How can agassi just disappear?

28:23.084 --> 28:24.920
Phone? No phone at all?

28:24.920 --> 28:27.214
I called all night, but no one answered.

28:29.507 --> 28:32.260
He said last night promised would like to meet with Ha Ji.

28:34.095 --> 28:35.931
Perchance fall where?

28:36.389 --> 28:38.683
He said if the parents fall in the streets,

28:38.683 --> 28:42.354
they will be brought to the nursing home in the countryside.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.189
Granny mall Piaw out?

28:44.189 --> 28:46.483
Do not make jokes that only dogs can hear laughing.

28:46.483 --> 28:48.777
If so, was kidnapped?

28:48.777 --> 28:51.530
Who would want to kidnap an old woman?

28:51.530 --> 28:53.823
Anyway, Grandma Mal Soon tongue biting off more mending,

28:53.823 --> 28:56.117
instead of making his family paid a ransom.

28:56.117 --> 28:58.870
That's why so why worry.

29:01.164 --> 29:02.082
Profesor Ban...

29:02.082 --> 29:05.293
If the ransom is not enough, let me know.

29:05.293 --> 29:08.046
Even if I have to sell this house, I also have to help Agassi.

29:08.964 --> 29:11.716
Selling a home? I continue?

29:11.716 --> 29:14.928
The time you asked me and Baekgu sleep in a kennel?

29:14.928 --> 29:17.222
In the hearts of the father, the daughter is not more valuable than a dog.

29:17.222 --> 29:19.057
Tutup mulutmu, kunyuk!

29:20.433 --> 29:23.645
By the way, has been a police report?

29:23.645 --> 29:25.939
They said it must wait a few days could make a report.

29:25.939 --> 29:29.609
What if one of these days something happens to agassi?

29:55.760 --> 29:57.137
Not!

30:07.689 --> 30:11.818
- Forehead all the fat, eggs can not be broken. - Aigoo, the basis of these girls.

30:12.277 --> 30:14.571
All day like this, just do not deserve marriage-marriage.

30:16.865 --> 30:19.618
Aging so, what actually my sin?

30:28.794 --> 30:30.170
What happened exactly?

30:32.923 --> 30:34.758
No pain at all.

30:41.181 --> 30:42.557
Young age is a blessing.

30:42.557 --> 30:44.392
Jump there, jump here, just like a contortionist.

30:45.310 --> 30:46.686
Just like that, as if what he'd like?

30:47.145 --> 30:48.522
Just look at her waist!

30:48.980 --> 30:50.357
Like the octopus.

30:51.733 --> 30:54.486
If he were an octopus, I was gaebul. Move!

31:01.827 --> 31:02.744
Miraculous!

31:03.203 --> 31:04.121
Why waist still survive?

31:04.121 --> 31:05.038

31:13.755 --> 31:15.590
Not that I want evicted? Why phone again?

31:23.849 --> 31:27.060
Yeah ya! Want to see me grow old and die just like that?

31:27.060 --> 31:29.354
Totally not fair.

31:29.354 --> 31:32.107
That's why I was given this opportunity by the Lord.

Aigoo, cute little baby.

32:59.277 --> 33:01.113
Try to pluck piece I ate chili.

33:06.159 --> 33:07.994
Aigoo, very good.

33:35.522 --> 33:37.357
You said you had wider?

33:40.110 --> 33:42.863
But, how do you know if my house was looking for the boarders?

33:43.780 --> 33:45.615
I see there are stuck outside.

33:46.074 --> 33:47.451
So long as the announcement disobek.

33:47.451 --> 33:49.286
So long as I see it.

33:52.497 --> 33:54.333
500 thousand a month including breakfast and dinner.

34:02.132 --> 34:03.967
Young Kira my idiot?

34:04.885 --> 34:07.179
I know first the price is 400 thousand. Fuck 500 thousand?

34:09.473 --> 34:10.849
I could eat alone.

34:11.308 --> 34:14.978
I think it was 300 thousand for enough room.

34:14.978 --> 34:16.813
The direction the room tolerable.

34:16.813 --> 34:19.565
Moreover, the young girl who lived in this place before

34:19.565 --> 34:21.400
leave a dressing table.

34:21.400 --> 34:22.319
But Agassi,

34:22.777 --> 34:24.612
once you come here?

34:27.366 --> 34:30.118
But anyway, how come it feels like I've met you before?

34:31.494 --> 34:33.789
To and fro may have crossed paths.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.083
Father, gone home?

34:37.918 --> 34:39.753
He is a new person who intends ngekos here.

34:41.128 --> 34:43.422
But, what's your name?

34:44.340 --> 34:45.257

34:46.176 --> 34:47.552
My name is ...

34:49.846 --> 34:50.764
Oh Doo Ri.

34:51.681 --> 34:53.058
Oh Doo Ri?

34:53.058 --> 34:57.186
[NOTE: Audrey pronunciation and Oh Doo Ri similar] - Agassi my most liked by Audrey Hepburn. - Audrey?

34:58.563 --> 35:01.316
Doo Ri... Oh Doo Ri.

35:01.316 --> 35:03.151
[NOTE: Cha Doo Ri, pemain sepak bola FC Seoul]
Doo Ri-nya Cha Doo Ri?

35:03.151 --> 35:04.528
Oh you're from where?

35:04.528 --> 35:06.363
Agassi Oh you are out of Haeju.

35:06.363 --> 35:08.198
I also much less so.

35:08.657 --> 35:10.951
If so, I wore the rooms yes.

35:11.410 --> 35:12.786
Wait a minute!

35:15.998 --> 35:18.292
Ordinary boarding must pay in advance.

35:41.231 --> 35:42.608
- = I'm gone, you live well. = -

35:43.066 --> 35:45.360
Want to use this way of protest?

35:46.278 --> 35:49.031
People who really want to escape from this house is me.

35:49.031 --> 35:51.325
Should we call the police first.

35:51.325 --> 35:53.619
Do you want to destroy your father's career?

35:53.619 --> 35:55.454
Why do not you just call the TV station?

35:55.454 --> 35:58.665
Old grandmother told them to escape. And his son is a member of gerontology. - = Gerontology: knowledge learned through various aspects of the aging process. = -

36:01.418 --> 36:03.253
Ibu, only to power?

36:16.558 --> 36:19.311
Oppa, a young girl who sits in front of the who?

36:21.146 --> 36:22.522
He is the son of our boarding.

36:22.981 --> 36:25.275
Why should a young girl to come to this place?

36:25.734 --> 36:28.946
She says she likes to places like this. Maybe she was raised by her grandmother.

36:29.863 --> 36:30.781
Oh ya?

36:32.616 --> 36:36.286
It's time for me to retire too?

36:37.663 --> 36:39.957
Nice thought, Oppa.

36:39.957 --> 36:42.709
Already from the first-first supposed to be so.

36:42.709 --> 36:46.838
What good old grandmother suffered from it?

36:46.838 --> 36:50.050
Not, it means stopping work from this place.

36:50.509 --> 36:53.720
However, I have to look for Agassi to meet.

36:54.179 --> 36:57.849
Her body was so weak. Do not know where she is now.

36:58.308 --> 37:00.602
Do not know if he's eating properly.

37:17.119 --> 37:19.413
What else this woman?

37:33.176 --> 37:34.094
It is something to be proud of? The basis of this woman!

37:45.105 --> 37:47.858
This woman, her face skin as thick as a rhino!

37:53.822 --> 37:56.575
Here may be a little difficult. The place is much smaller than we imagined.

37:57.034 --> 37:59.786
Parking problems do not have to talk about, but the security issues surrounding region is also a problem.

38:01.622 --> 38:03.916
Did not I say this place is not so okay.

38:03.916 --> 38:05.751
The place to set the stage as well not exist.

38:07.127 --> 38:08.045
Grandpa!

38:09.421 --> 38:11.256
It's coming, Ha Ji?

38:12.174 --> 38:13.550
How?

38:13.550 --> 38:14.927
Problems already escaped from our house to the police report.

38:15.844 --> 38:17.221
Grandma did not call you?

38:18.138 --> 38:19.056
Do not worry.

38:19.515 --> 38:22.726
I will certainly find Agassi.

38:26.855 --> 38:28.690
Degrees are also good at singing.

38:29.149 --> 38:34.196
In terms of singing, no one can match Mal Soon Agassi.

38:47.042 --> 38:49.336
Day of hiding in the dark-dark like that,

38:49.336 --> 38:52.548
occasionally come out to enjoy the warmth of the sun, it may as well.

38:56.218 --> 38:58.971
Seonbae, think it not interesting?

39:00.347 --> 39:02.641
Property ibunya Doo Get?

39:03.100 --> 39:06.770
Since we've come, what if we photograph with Doo Ri's mother first new home?

39:07.688 --> 39:11.817
Hey, if you have time like that, used to think of new talent search show.

39:12.276 --> 39:15.028
Not because you want to find a new idol, a band that does not have the ability to also recruited.

39:15.028 --> 39:18.699
~ Secretly merintik rain ... ~

39:21.910 --> 39:26.039

39:51.273 --> 39:53.567
Who could love a man like this?

39:55.402 --> 39:56.320

40:00.908 --> 40:05.496

40:39.905 --> 40:43.117
~ Kuberpaling and look back ... ~

40:43.117 --> 40:46.787
~ Do not look any nevertheless ... ~

40:46.787 --> 40:52.751
~ There is only the lonely rain. ~

40:53.669 --> 40:58.257
~ Secretly merintik rain ... ~

42:22.216 --> 42:25.886
President Director Kim already know if Gong Ju is his biological daughter?

42:25.886 --> 42:28.639
No, he does not yet know.

42:28.639 --> 42:30.933
= There is a need of what Chairman Kim to come here today? =

42:30.933 --> 42:32.768
He would know today. Immediately.

42:33.685 --> 42:37.815
= Say your conference today in Shanghai, =

42:37.815 --> 42:41.944
Just little things like this why delay continues? Bacotnya much more.

42:42.403 --> 42:45.614
If people are asked to go to drama tolerance, when it was knocked out of the day.

42:45.614 --> 42:49.284
Young girls like you, dialekmu very thick.

42:49.284 --> 42:52.955
I was raised by my grandmother.

42:52.955 --> 42:55.708
Then, old song that was also you learned from your grandmother?

42:58.919 --> 43:00.295
Miraculous.

43:03.507 --> 43:04.883

43:05.342 --> 43:10.389
The way you talk, do something, to sing any ...

43:10.389 --> 43:12.683
really similar to someone I know.

43:12.683 --> 43:15.894
Biden, aku Masuka as Dulu.

43:15.894 --> 43:17.271
Want to go now?

43:17.730 --> 43:20.941

43:31.035 --> 43:32.870
Soon! Love greetings come on!

43:33.329 --> 43:36.081
He's already like his own grandson.

43:36.081 --> 43:39.293
He said no one wants to talk to him.

43:42.046 --> 43:43.422
Well, time would be know.

43:43.422 --> 43:45.257
= You are my daughter, Gong Ju? =

43:45.257 --> 43:48.469
= In 1993, the 5th of August, the day Gwakbokjeol ... =

43:48.469 --> 43:52.139
= When you play fireworks on the River Chuncheonsoyang, you suddenly disappeared. =

43:52.139 --> 43:54.433

43:55.351 --> 43:56.268
=Gong Ju...=

43:58.103 --> 43:59.938
Dad ... Dad ...

44:06.362 --> 44:10.491

44:14.161 --> 44:17.831
Aigoo, snot-nosed kids who are not strong drink being what?

44:18.290 --> 44:22.419
Miss Doo Ri was drinking soju alone with men?

44:22.878 --> 44:26.090
Your father out because of me and your grandfather drank most, kunyuk!

44:26.090 --> 44:28.384
Why be shy?

44:28.384 --> 44:30.678
Not daring to look at anyone else.

44:30.678 --> 44:33.430
Aigoo, are not you dare look at him, kunyuk.

44:33.430 --> 44:35.265
First time in my life,

44:36.642 --> 44:38.477
the first time I felt a feeling like that before.

44:38.936 --> 44:43.065
Wait a minute! These words were first uttered by the kunyuk grandfather to me.

44:44.441 --> 44:49.029
Aigoo, afraid of people do not know what they were grandparents and grandchildren? Until the eyes are also similar.

44:49.947 --> 44:54.535
I have a request. You should never be pushed.

44:54.994 --> 44:55.452
Understand?

44:55.452 --> 44:58.664
Is not this is a dialogue that night?

45:00.958 --> 45:02.793
Together with ...

45:03.252 --> 45:07.840
Together with ...

45:07.840 --> 45:10.134
- pass through this life how? - Not! There is absolutely no way!

45:10.134 --> 45:13.804
Not just poured sand into my eyes, pouring mud also can not!

45:13.804 --> 45:17.016
Not!

45:17.016 --> 45:18.392
Can not ya?

45:21.145 --> 45:22.980
To be honest, we like this band ...

45:22.980 --> 45:24.815
indeed too merugikanmu.

45:26.650 --> 45:27.568
A - acne? Nyanyi?

45:31.697 --> 45:33.991
What you want to do with you is singing?

45:33.991 --> 45:37.202
I formed a band, but do not have a lead singer.

45:39.038 --> 45:40.873
He quarreled with me.

45:41.332 --> 45:45.920
There is no lead vocals, also no place to practice.

45:45.920 --> 45:47.755
What a pity.

45:48.213 --> 45:51.884
Still have to worry about events at home.

45:51.884 --> 45:53.260
How do you know?

45:53.260 --> 45:55.554
Yeah ya! How did I know?

45:55.554 --> 45:58.766
You were right. There was a slight problem in my family.

45:59.224 --> 46:01.060
My mother had a heart attack.

46:01.518 --> 46:03.812
Father and nunaku feel the incident is the responsibility of my grandmother.

46:04.271 --> 46:06.565
Because it was my grandmother escaped from the house.

46:06.565 --> 46:08.400
But it is the responsibility of all I said.

46:08.400 --> 46:10.236
Grandmother escaped from the house as well.

46:10.694 --> 46:13.447
My mother also fell ill. All of this because I was too annoying.

46:14.365 --> 46:16.200
That ... did not seem like it.

46:16.200 --> 46:18.953
Who knows? Miss Doo Ri'm not understand me.

46:18.953 --> 46:21.705
Basic kunyuk! Your name alone is my gift.

46:22.164 --> 46:23.999
Ban Ji Ha, what a name like this?

46:24.458 --> 46:25.834
The name alone is annoying.

46:33.175 --> 46:36.845
Yes I have! Singing is not it? Yes already singing.

46:36.845 --> 46:39.139
I sing later.

46:39.139 --> 46:40.516
A right band? Tomorrow we start training.

46:40.975 --> 46:42.351
Basic!

46:42.810 --> 46:49.692
~ Kuberpaling and look back ... Do not look any nevertheless ... ~

46:49.692 --> 46:53.362
~ There is only the lonely rain. ~

46:53.821 --> 46:56.115
~ Rain ... ~

46:57.032 --> 46:58.868
How? Fun, is not it?

46:58.868 --> 47:01.620
You know what he nicknames in the outcome? Ho BBang (red bean steamed buns content).

47:03.455 --> 47:04.373
Hobbang!

47:07.126 --> 47:09.879
White exterior, but inside black.

47:09.879 --> 47:11.255
Filled with the spirit of the black soul music.

47:15.384 --> 47:18.596
Do Hobbang, what if KkwaBaeGi (donut pretzels) alone?

47:24.101 --> 47:27.313
Why else PD Han? Did not he ask me to find a flow of soul singer?

47:27.313 --> 47:31.901
She's looking for a Cinderella. Cinderella is singing a song directly after disappearing.

47:31.901 --> 47:33.736
Cinderella? White?

47:40.159 --> 47:41.535
Hey, it's over! Gak goes continue!

47:44.288 --> 47:45.664
Hey, hey, hey! Sudah selesai!

48:18.697 --> 48:19.615
Aigoo...

48:19.615 --> 48:22.368
This is the song his own creations. Cool, is not it?

48:22.368 --> 48:24.662
Of capitalist social gap between rich and poor.

48:24.662 --> 48:26.497
Generation of 880 thousand. [Love the younger generation educated but earn 880 thousand Won]

48:26.497 --> 48:28.791
Expressed with music Metalika flow.

48:28.791 --> 48:30.167
Family you know?

48:30.167 --> 48:32.002
These guys dress up like the streets outside?

48:35.214 --> 48:38.425
Given to eat and live comfortably, but you just do not like this useful.

48:40.261 --> 48:43.931
Miss Doo Ri may not really understand the flow of music like this.

48:43.931 --> 48:45.766
The so-called music

48:45.766 --> 48:49.895
not to vibrate the eardrum, but thrilling.

48:50.354 --> 48:52.189
After hearing your music, I did not feel anything.

48:52.189 --> 48:55.401
Want sesemangat whatever people are singing, what's the point?

48:55.860 --> 48:58.154
You have heard of people who after hearing this song and praise you if this song good?

49:00.906 --> 49:03.200
So what kind of song you want to sing?

49:08.247 --> 49:12.835

49:44.950 --> 49:49.079

~ Letter filled with words of love. ~

49:57.797 --> 50:01.926
~ After arriving in the city of LA, let me know about you. ~

50:04.220 --> 50:08.808
~ Tell me about the weather and your mood. ~

50:10.643 --> 50:13.854
~ Well it was a fun day, or day-to-day sad. ~

50:13.854 --> 50:17.066
~ Remember always every day ... ~

50:17.066 --> 50:23.948
'The days of ever you did with me. Do not forget you. '

50:30.371 --> 50:32.665
Imo (Aunt), we want a large portion jokbal (pig's feet).

50:32.665 --> 50:34.959
Do jokbal, apbal alone.

50:34.959 --> 50:37.253
Apdari much more tender and fragrant.

50:37.711 --> 50:40.923
Aigoo, young lady so why is that idea?

50:40.923 --> 50:42.299

50:54.228 --> 50:56.063
Try to call Oppa! Come quick!

50:56.981 --> 51:02.027
Oppa! Oppa! Oppa! Oppa!

51:03.863 --> 51:04.780
Oppa ...

51:04.780 --> 51:06.615

51:07.074 --> 51:08.909

51:09.368 --> 51:12.580
~ As long as they get along with you ... ~

51:12.580 --> 51:15.791

~ Bye ... bye my love. ~

51:49.283 --> 51:55.247
~ Bye ... bye my love. ~

52:12.223 --> 52:14.058
It seems like going for milk.

52:15.434 --> 52:16.811
Oh ya?

52:21.399 --> 52:22.775
Here son, let I carried.

52:29.198 --> 52:31.492
Aigoo, adorable.

52:38.374 --> 52:42.044
Aigoo, why given that so little clothing?

52:42.044 --> 52:46.173
If it feels hot, it could stay open just clothes. Can flu in contact with air.

52:46.173 --> 52:48.467
Aigoo, also do not wear socks.

52:48.467 --> 52:50.302
Hold your right!

52:53.055 --> 52:54.890
Minum ASI for?

52:55.349 --> 52:57.643
He was so drinking milk directly diarrhea.

52:57.643 --> 53:00.396
Looks like mother's milk is watered once.

53:00.855 --> 53:03.149
Actually, every mother's milk is different.

53:03.149 --> 53:07.278
If thick, babies who drink will be fat and healthy.

53:07.278 --> 53:10.031
digestion was also good, eek too smoothly.

53:10.031 --> 53:14.618
If dilute, so drink directly diarrhea.

53:14.618 --> 53:18.289
The baby will also be small and thin, plus like crying.

53:21.500 --> 53:24.253
Milk is too thin, so you can only drink milk powder.

53:24.712 --> 53:26.088
Aigoo, what a pity.

53:29.300 --> 53:30.217
To!

53:31.135 --> 53:33.429
A young girl like you, with whom you were discussing about breastfeeding?

53:33.888 --> 53:36.641

53:40.311 --> 53:42.146

54:23.896 --> 54:26.190

54:29.402 --> 54:30.778
Who are you?

54:30.778 --> 54:32.613

54:32.613 --> 54:36.742
Who are you? Followed me like a dog in the mating season.

54:37.660 --> 54:41.330
Miss spiel is really funny.

54:45.918 --> 54:49.130
You may never see me, but I've seen you.

54:49.589 --> 54:53.259
Aigoo, so young could be so tiring.

54:53.259 --> 54:57.388
Sorry? Anyway, we can often see,

54:57.388 --> 54:59.682
then indeed we are made for each other.

54:59.682 --> 55:02.893
Paired? You and me?

55:02.893 --> 55:07.481
Aigoo, I'm Such funny?

55:09.317 --> 55:12.069
Wow! Truly unique!

55:12.528 --> 55:14.822
Totally different with the girls today.

55:16.657 --> 55:18.951
What if we have discussions moment somewhere?

55:19.869 --> 55:23.539
Enough! While I still speak well, you get out of here!

55:28.586 --> 55:30.880
Jodoh palamu!

55:31.797 --> 55:33.174
Anu, wait a minute!

55:36.844 --> 55:38.679
Aigoo, only ... only ...

55:41.891 --> 55:46.020
Aigoo... tolong!

55:47.396 --> 55:48.314
What events occur?

55:55.196 --> 55:56.113
Not like that.

55:57.031 --> 55:59.325
Wait a minute!

55:59.325 --> 56:00.701
I know him.

56:00.701 --> 56:02.536
Agassi, you know this guy?

56:02.536 --> 56:06.666
Do not know! Aigoo, shameful!

56:07.583 --> 56:09.418
Agassi!, What number?

56:09.418 --> 56:11.254
Tell me your number!

56:11.254 --> 56:12.171
Agassi!

56:19.053 --> 56:22.265
In short, the lower part of his body was always lead to trouble.

56:23.182 --> 56:27.311
Do not know why also, just because a small piece of meat so, even self-destructive.

56:28.688 --> 56:30.982
Just eat it!

56:57.133 --> 56:58.050
It's hot!

56:58.968 --> 57:03.097
Aigoo, why do not in fact have to be outside?

57:04.932 --> 57:08.144
Welcome. Come on that is so hot definitely tiring yes?

57:08.603 --> 57:09.979
Halo!

57:12.273 --> 57:15.026
His health is pretty good. In vain did I worry.

57:16.402 --> 57:19.155
Ha Ji had a friend who turned out to be so pretty.

57:19.614 --> 57:21.908
Lately, the little boy who perform plastic surgery can also result like that.

57:21.908 --> 57:24.202
The results of your surgery is pretty good too. Operations where?

57:24.202 --> 57:26.496
Like a child who is so cheeky!

57:26.496 --> 57:29.248
Do not be ignored. She was so because similar to my grandmother.

57:31.542 --> 57:35.213
Ha Ji, bring your friends into. After dinner is finished, the new kupanggil.

57:36.130 --> 57:38.424
- Yeah, let's go up to the top! - Anu, if it does not interfere with ...

57:38.883 --> 57:40.718
I may look around the house?

57:53.105 --> 57:55.858
May I look around this room?

57:56.776 --> 57:59.529
It was my grandmother's room.

58:00.446 --> 58:03.199
My grandmother was not there, so ...

58:06.869 --> 58:10.081
I was raised by my grandmother.

58:10.998 --> 58:13.751
I was reminded of my grandmother who had died.

58:18.798 --> 58:19.715
Take a look!

58:21.551 --> 58:22.927
Nenekkku can certainly understand.

58:24.303 --> 58:26.597
Ji Ha! Can you get me a bowl!

58:26.597 --> 58:28.891
Wait a minute yes!

58:44.949 --> 58:46.325
Nice!

58:46.784 --> 58:49.996
They are thought to block my card, I'm going to go home?

58:52.290 --> 58:55.042
The conclusion of our investigation ...

58:55.042 --> 58:56.419
Oh Mal Soon instead of running away from home, but was kidnapped.

58:56.878 --> 59:01.466
From this it can be seen if he has to make sure the angle and location of CCTV.

59:01.466 --> 59:03.301
Plus she uses an umbrella.

59:04.218 --> 59:05.595
This is not just any recidivist.

59:06.512 --> 59:08.806
Assessed from the location of the money,

59:08.806 --> 59:13.394
most likely place where the offender and victim lived very close.

59:13.853 --> 59:17.523
In the area around you there are people like this?

59:23.946 --> 59:26.240
The food does not match the taste?

59:26.240 --> 59:28.534
No, so good.

59:29.452 --> 59:31.746
Another talking face expressions.

59:33.122 --> 59:35.875
But when cooking fish,

59:36.793 --> 59:39.087
radishes do not just put it on the bottom only.

59:39.087 --> 59:40.463
If the top of the well placed,

59:40.922 --> 59:45.510
lobaknya juice will absorb into the meat of the fish so that it feels more comfortable.

59:47.345 --> 59:48.262
Things like this you know?

59:49.180 --> 59:51.474
Mother, Doo Ri is different with the girls today.

59:52.850 --> 59:54.227
Yes, yes ... I think so.

59:57.438 --> 01:00:02.485
It looks like the children's father came home from work a little late today.

01:00:03.861 --> 01:00:06.155
Iya. Looks like there is a problem that must be sharply resolved.

01:00:06.155 --> 01:00:07.990
Because it home a little late.

01:00:08.449 --> 01:00:09.367
This you also nosy.

01:00:09.367 --> 01:00:12.120
Mother, they both want to courtship?

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.625
Gratuitous!

01:00:16.249 --> 01:00:17.625
It's coming huh?

01:00:25.883 --> 01:00:30.471
Aigoo ... it's coming ... the signs.

01:00:31.389 --> 01:00:32.765
Anu, a bathroom next to where?

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.436
There, the door was.

01:00:39.647 --> 01:00:40.565
Who is it?

01:00:40.565 --> 01:00:42.400
Friends who became a singer in my band.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.776
How?

01:00:45.153 --> 01:00:46.988
I go change first.

01:00:46.988 --> 01:00:48.364
Had dinner?

01:00:49.282 --> 01:00:50.658
There is no appetite.

01:01:56.724 --> 01:01:58.101
I go to the bathroom for a while.

01:02:22.875 --> 01:02:28.381
~ Secretly merintik rain ... ~

01:02:29.298 --> 01:02:33.886
~ It makes me fond memories of the day ... ~

01:02:33.886 --> 01:02:35.263
-=Han Seung Woo=-

01:02:35.263 --> 01:02:40.310
So, you're actually working on a TV station?

01:02:42.145 --> 01:02:43.521
Now you have to believe in what I say, right?

01:02:46.733 --> 01:02:48.109
Aigoo...

01:02:49.027 --> 01:02:51.779
Not the sake of making money,

01:02:51.779 --> 01:02:54.991
deceive young children, right?

01:02:54.991 --> 01:02:55.450
To!

01:02:55.908 --> 01:02:58.202
Why are you talking like that in our PD?

01:02:58.661 --> 01:03:00.038
Then, I explained quite simply.

01:03:00.496 --> 01:03:02.332
In our program, I would like to ...

01:03:02.332 --> 01:03:04.626
introduce Doo Ri and friends bandmu.

01:03:04.626 --> 01:03:05.543
It?

01:03:05.543 --> 01:03:07.378
Really, Seonbae!

01:03:07.378 --> 01:03:09.672
How can you let a new person who has never released an album,

01:03:09.672 --> 01:03:11.507
only heard the song once they have them instantly appear on the show?

01:03:11.507 --> 01:03:15.178
If so, who released an album more intelligent than their singing?

01:03:15.178 --> 01:03:18.848
However, they do not have much experience.

01:03:18.848 --> 01:03:20.224
The live broadcast is currently in play?

01:03:20.224 --> 01:03:22.060
If you need another exercise room, let alone me.

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:23.895
I will help you find a place that is adequate.

01:03:24.354 --> 01:03:27.106
Why do not you set the order of their upcoming shows!

01:03:28.024 --> 01:03:29.400
Seonbae!

01:03:31.694 --> 01:03:33.988
Thank you! We will certainly do our best.

01:03:36.282 --> 01:03:37.200
Why? Escaped?

01:03:38.117 --> 01:03:39.494
Very nice! Very nice!

01:03:40.411 --> 01:03:44.540
Awesome performance.

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:46.834
Nice! Nice!

01:03:47.293 --> 01:03:50.964
Aigoo, for Oppa juga ...

01:03:50.964 --> 01:03:52.799
Awesome performance.

01:03:53.716 --> 01:03:56.010
Everyone's really great!

01:04:07.939 --> 01:04:10.692
On where the people?

01:04:13.903 --> 01:04:16.656
Baekku, at home no one at all?

01:04:41.889 --> 01:04:43.725
Mati much!

01:04:45.101 --> 01:04:47.395
The old man was crazy huh?

01:04:47.854 --> 01:04:51.524
Want to catch anyone? Disposable carry sticks at night blind.

01:04:52.442 --> 01:04:56.571
Crazy and want to go to jail yes?

01:04:56.571 --> 01:04:59.782
Doing so is only done by a crazy person.

01:05:01.618 --> 01:05:02.994
Whoop!

01:05:03.912 --> 01:05:07.582
I pull out what's on in your mouth first. Others do not hope!

01:05:11.252 --> 01:05:14.464
Belangmu finally emerge!

01:05:14.923 --> 01:05:17.675
Already from the start I should have realized.

01:05:18.134 --> 01:05:21.346

Aigoo, very noisy!

01:05:25.934 --> 01:05:28.686
How could I not recognize dentures Agassi?

01:05:29.604 --> 01:05:33.274
It is my gift to the birthday agassi 70th.

01:05:34.192 --> 01:05:35.568
Did you kill him?

01:05:37.403 --> 01:05:38.780
You buried him in the mountain?

01:05:41.991 --> 01:05:44.744
Why should continue to ask questions?

01:05:44.744 --> 01:05:47.038
It made me remove the Hangang feed.

01:05:47.038 --> 01:05:48.414
Then kill me too!

01:05:49.332 --> 01:05:53.461
Without agassi, life is meaningless.

01:05:54.379 --> 01:05:57.590
Kill me too!

01:05:57.590 --> 01:05:59.425
Kill too me, throw me to the Hangang and let me on the side agassi.

01:05:59.884 --> 01:06:03.096
What good is an old woman? Until that much joy?

01:06:03.096 --> 01:06:04.931
Tahu leaves only!

01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:08.142
Do you know how beautiful Agassi me?

01:06:14.107 --> 01:06:17.318
When I was 13 years old, I lost my parents.

01:06:18.695 --> 01:06:21.447
I live in the family home agassi.

01:06:23.283 --> 01:06:26.035
No matter how my day,

01:06:26.494 --> 01:06:29.247
so see the smile agassi,

01:06:30.165 --> 01:06:32.917
I could survive.

01:06:33.835 --> 01:06:36.588
Then why can not you recognize me?

01:06:37.505 --> 01:06:38.882
What do you mean?

01:06:40.258 --> 01:06:43.928
Did not you say can not forget?

01:06:48.516 --> 01:06:52.187
If so, you are able to recognize me?

01:06:54.022 --> 01:06:55.857
What are you doing this?

01:06:56.774 --> 01:06:59.068

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:08.703
Aigoo, already so you still can not recognize me. Totally nonsense!

01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:26.596

01:07:29.808 --> 01:07:31.184

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.478

Property Berlalu, Oh Malachi Soon.

01:07:38.525 --> 01:07:40.360
Agassi!

01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:47.700
So it means that this is not a fake, but the original teeth?

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:50.453
Of course.

01:07:50.912 --> 01:07:52.288
A few days ago I was eating ribs.

01:07:52.747 --> 01:07:56.876
Kukunyah galbinya bone to shreds.

01:07:57.794 --> 01:07:58.711
Really envy.

01:07:59.629 --> 01:08:04.217
Next weekend, I'm going to the TV station.

01:08:04.217 --> 01:08:05.593
Stasiun TV?

01:08:06.511 --> 01:08:09.722
Want to go to a dance stage? Then we went together.

01:08:11.099 --> 01:08:15.228
This is the look I look to watch a dance stage?

01:08:21.192 --> 01:08:24.863
I ... want to be a singer.

01:08:25.779 --> 01:08:28.533
Really as a singer who appeared on the TV?

01:08:28.533 --> 01:08:30.826
Sure dong! Really be a singer.

01:08:30.826 --> 01:08:34.497
From childhood I've wanted to be a singer.

01:08:34.497 --> 01:08:36.332
Yes also. I know it.

01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:41.837
~ Secretly merintik rain ... ~

01:08:41.837 --> 01:08:44.591
Truly astounding.

01:08:44.591 --> 01:08:47.801
The only time you are surprised?

01:08:47.801 --> 01:08:53.767
PD TV stations until dumbfounded.

01:08:53.767 --> 01:08:59.731
He said I sang with all my soul.

01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:03.859
Say I have a soul.

01:09:03.859 --> 01:09:06.154
Then Agassi now if it was not in Seoul, What do where?

01:09:07.529 --> 01:09:09.823
You're better off just eating this fruit ice!

01:09:19.459 --> 01:09:23.587
But Hyun July seemed very worried.

01:09:28.176 --> 01:09:29.551
That's why ...

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:31.388
Eomonie?

01:09:32.763 --> 01:09:34.140
You're met with Eomonie?

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:35.975
Eomonie there where now?

01:09:35.975 --> 01:09:40.104
Do not rush. Slowly.

01:09:40.104 --> 01:09:41.939
When did you meet her?

01:09:41.939 --> 01:09:45.609
Came like the wind, away like smoke.

01:09:45.609 --> 01:09:47.904
He advised that you do not worry.

01:09:47.904 --> 01:09:51.573
He left a letter.

01:09:53.868 --> 01:09:55.245
This is true Eomonie handwriting.

01:09:55.703 --> 01:09:57.539
Underneath his stamp is still there.

01:09:57.997 --> 01:10:00.291
Agassi as,

01:10:01.209 --> 01:10:03.962
live the life she wants to feel different.

01:10:03.962 --> 01:10:07.632
In the past though he could never live in accordance with his will.

01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:13.596
Therefore he requested that his credit card reactivated.

01:10:13.596 --> 01:10:14.514
He said trouble.

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:19.102
He said, he would come home on time.

01:10:19.102 --> 01:10:20.937
On second thought ...

01:10:21.396 --> 01:10:23.690
Do it once ceremony.

01:10:23.690 --> 01:10:25.066
The ceremony ...

01:10:25.984 --> 01:10:27.819
The wedding ceremony?

01:10:28.278 --> 01:10:30.113
Did not I say?

01:10:30.113 --> 01:10:33.324
From now on he wants to live as he wishes.

01:10:33.783 --> 01:10:34.701
With who?

01:10:34.701 --> 01:10:38.371
Can anyone else? Of course I am.

01:10:40.206 --> 01:10:42.500
The truth? This Ajussi ...

01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:46.629
Is what true? Do you think I was not in harmony with agassi?

01:10:47.088 --> 01:10:50.300
Small time I was a lad. You're also merendahkanku?

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:54.429
Agassi now more confident than I believed in her son.

01:10:54.429 --> 01:10:57.640
My heart is a heart agassi. Heart agassi is my heart.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.017
You ask yourself!

01:11:23.333 --> 01:11:25.168
Definitely not one anymore.

01:11:25.168 --> 01:11:27.921
The girl had it all planned.

01:11:28.838 --> 01:11:30.674
Where possible?

01:11:31.591 --> 01:11:35.720
I thought only tampangmu just a stupid, stupid turns your brains.

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.014
That's why you do not marry-marry.

01:11:39.849 --> 01:11:43.520
Korean style of your home, the only property alone is how much money.

01:11:43.979 --> 01:11:48.566

01:11:57.742 --> 01:12:00.036
Who knew it could be too young?

01:12:23.435 --> 01:12:24.352
How?

01:12:24.811 --> 01:12:25.729

Grandpa!

01:17:34.037 --> 01:17:35.413
You've come?

01:17:35.413 --> 01:17:38.166
Grandpa, if tired lay down and rest on the couch.

01:17:38.166 --> 01:17:39.543
You look a little pale.

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:44.131
He did real, old farts!

01:17:44.131 --> 01:17:45.966
On the other side there is a hot water bath.

01:17:45.966 --> 01:17:47.342
You just soak in there!

01:17:47.342 --> 01:17:48.718
Not!

01:17:49.177 --> 01:17:51.930
Slide was too boring, so I did not go up.

01:17:52.389 --> 01:17:55.142
Nothing is more stressful?

01:18:06.153 --> 01:18:07.070
That one!

01:18:07.988 --> 01:18:10.282
Typhoon when I was young.

01:18:10.282 --> 01:18:12.576
People who do not easily panic ...

01:18:13.034 --> 01:18:16.246
Pado is sejatiku partner.

01:18:21.752 --> 01:18:23.587
Why the hell you got-got?

01:18:24.045 --> 01:18:29.092
I think to a regular pool. Who knows this turns out.

01:18:29.551 --> 01:18:30.927
But, Agassi ...

01:18:30.927 --> 01:18:33.221
Do not you reveal your skin too much?

01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.974
How? Sexy is not it?

01:18:37.809 --> 01:18:39.186
Palingkan head!

01:18:40.103 --> 01:18:41.938
What are you looking at?

01:18:41.938 --> 01:18:43.774
She is a grandmother!

01:18:43.774 --> 01:18:47.903
Agassi, do not worry! I'll take care of you.

01:19:11.301 --> 01:19:12.219
You did nothing?

01:19:19.559 --> 01:19:20.936
We're out of here now?

01:19:21.853 --> 01:19:23.230
Possess.

01:19:52.592 --> 01:19:53.969
How are you feeling?

01:19:56.263 --> 01:19:57.639
The feeling of what?

01:19:57.639 --> 01:20:00.392
After the show aired, in real-time search is tops.

01:20:01.309 --> 01:20:03.603
The reporters kept asking who you are, and intend to do the interview.

01:20:03.603 --> 01:20:05.897
Not to be!

01:20:05.897 --> 01:20:08.191
Why? Other people actually expect this opportunity.

01:20:08.650 --> 01:20:13.238
If my father to know ...

01:20:13.697 --> 01:20:16.450
hair can be shaved completely bald.

01:20:18.744 --> 01:20:19.661
Oh ya?

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:21.955
Then, other times we just talk about it.

01:20:22.414 --> 01:20:23.790
Tell me about yourself alone, Doo Ri.

01:20:26.084 --> 01:20:27.461
About what?

01:20:27.461 --> 01:20:29.755
I'm very curious towards you.

01:20:29.755 --> 01:20:31.590
But did not know anything about you.

01:20:33.425 --> 01:20:35.719
It was ...

01:20:37.095 --> 01:20:38.930
Do not get excited.

01:20:39.848 --> 01:20:43.977
Little by little.

01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:50.400
But we really destined, huh?

01:20:52.235 --> 01:20:53.612
It seems so.

01:20:59.117 --> 01:21:01.870
But why are your feet? Hurt?

01:21:05.999 --> 01:21:07.834

01:21:08.293 --> 01:21:09.670
It's okay?

01:21:09.670 --> 01:21:10.587
That's all right.

01:21:11.505 --> 01:21:15.175
I was there on drugs for a while.

01:21:15.175 --> 01:21:17.010
Do not be too concerned.

01:21:18.387 --> 01:21:19.304
It was ...

01:21:19.304 --> 01:21:21.139
Do not worry!

01:21:23.433 --> 01:21:24.810
Once a direct stab ya wrong! Ouch it hurts!

01:21:35.821 --> 01:21:38.115
If direct skin aging bleed.

01:21:39.491 --> 01:21:41.326

01:21:46.373 --> 01:21:50.502
But you want to go back to the original?

01:22:02.889 --> 01:22:03.807

01:22:03.807 --> 01:22:04.725

01:22:17.112 --> 01:22:18.947

01:22:40.969 --> 01:22:41.887

Why do I have to live like this until now?

01:23:26.848 --> 01:23:29.601
Before she died,

01:23:29.601 --> 01:23:31.436
he advised me to keep my father well.

01:23:34.648 --> 01:23:36.942

01:23:42.906 --> 01:23:44.741

Similar to the mother. Just know sulk.

01:23:47.494 --> 01:23:50.706
Mother ...

01:23:51.164 --> 01:23:54.835
For the sake of my father I have not married till now.

01:23:55.294 --> 01:23:58.046
How can that be against me?

01:23:58.505 --> 01:23:59.882

- Mom ... - can be torn pants!

01:24:15.939 --> 01:24:19.151
Agassi was really your mother.

01:24:20.986 --> 01:24:25.115
I know my words were hard to believe. But you have to believe.

01:24:25.115 --> 01:24:29.244
If so, who did you say that too Agassi ever run into this?

01:24:29.244 --> 01:24:33.832
Yes. He is agassiku, who also am your mother.

01:24:38.420 --> 01:24:39.338

01:24:45.302 --> 01:24:48.972
Yes, this is still an early stage. It should still be a way.

01:24:48.972 --> 01:24:52.184
Really, there are still ways.

01:24:52.643 --> 01:24:54.937
Blood! Take blood alone!

01:24:55.013 --> 01:24:59.601
Yes, blood. That, my colleagues at the university ...

01:25:00.901 --> 01:25:04.112
No one is working in a hospital. Let me ask him.

01:25:04.112 --> 01:25:07.783
Prof. Kim, it's me. There's something I want to ask you.

01:25:08.242 --> 01:25:11.453
Age about 70 years.

01:25:11.912 --> 01:25:14.665
Do not know depression or dementia.

01:25:14.665 --> 01:25:16.959
There is a little strange.

01:25:16.959 --> 01:25:18.335
Both of them?

01:25:25.217 --> 01:25:28.887
What does a female demon that to you?

01:25:30.264 --> 01:25:31.181
Enyah!

01:25:37.146 --> 01:25:39.439
If you give this land belongs to her right, I'll tell the police.

01:26:00.544 --> 01:26:01.920

01:26:11.555 --> 01:26:12.473
It was ...

01:26:15.225 --> 01:26:16.143
=Halo? Doo Ri?=

01:26:17.060 --> 01:26:20.272
Doo Ri =? Doo Ri, are you okay?

01:26:26.695 --> 01:26:28.530
Miraculous.

01:26:30.365 --> 01:26:31.742
Aigoo....

01:26:32.659 --> 01:26:34.495
His house is nice.

01:26:35.871 --> 01:26:37.706
The owner of this house is a PD?

01:26:38.624 --> 01:26:40.459
No, the rent.

01:26:43.670 --> 01:26:48.258
Yes also. Where young people can afford to pay for this house.

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:05.234
Can I ask you something?

01:27:07.986 --> 01:27:12.574
You're renting a house that is so good, continue to work well okay ...

01:27:13.033 --> 01:27:14.409
The person is also ...

01:27:16.703 --> 01:27:18.080
Its why?

01:27:21.291 --> 01:27:23.127
The person is also handsome.

01:27:24.503 --> 01:27:26.797
Why was not married?

01:27:28.173 --> 01:27:30.467
Who says I'm not married?

01:27:31.844 --> 01:27:32.761
Married huh?

01:27:37.349 --> 01:27:38.267
Not yet!

01:27:40.561 --> 01:27:43.313
It was nice to see Doo Ri surprised.

01:27:46.525 --> 01:27:49.278
Your mother must be very worried, huh?

01:27:49.278 --> 01:27:52.030
Adult children live like this alone.

01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:55.242
Mom would be very worried.

01:27:58.454 --> 01:28:01.206
My mother had died, when I was a kid.

01:28:09.006 --> 01:28:11.300
Doo Ri, you have a boyfriend?

01:28:29.193 --> 01:28:34.239
I've been left to die by my husband.

01:28:35.616 --> 01:28:39.286
I have a grown son and family.

01:28:40.204 --> 01:28:45.250
A widower with one child who liked me, because I

01:28:45.250 --> 01:28:47.544
quarreled with her daughter.

01:28:53.509 --> 01:28:54.426
I admit defeat.

01:28:56.261 --> 01:28:59.932
Other times can not be arbitrary and capricious Doo Ri again.

01:29:00.391 --> 01:29:03.602
If so, except widower son of the ...

01:29:03.602 --> 01:29:05.896
do you like the kind of guy that like?

01:29:08.649 --> 01:29:12.778
A man who does not let her children starve, and experts on the bed.

01:29:17.366 --> 01:29:18.283
You did nothing?

01:29:20.119 --> 01:29:21.495
How is this?

01:29:22.871 --> 01:29:25.165
Towel!

01:29:47.187 --> 01:29:48.564
Who are you?

01:29:54.528 --> 01:29:55.904
Aigoo...

01:29:56.363 --> 01:30:00.492
Is not strong drink still drink a lot.

01:30:24.808 --> 01:30:28.937
~ Go to sleep ... sleep ... dear ... ~

01:30:29.396 --> 01:30:33.525
~ Go to sleep soundly, my dear. ~

01:30:33.984 --> 01:30:38.572
Chicken ~ ~ Do you gobble ...

01:30:39.031 --> 01:30:43.619
~ Do not wake my dear ... ~

01:30:44.078 --> 01:30:48.666
~ Small dogs do not bark ... you ~

01:30:49.124 --> 01:30:53.712
~ Do not wake my dear ... ~

01:30:54.171 --> 01:30:58.759
~ Go to sleep ... sleep ... dear ... ~

01:30:59.218 --> 01:31:02.888
~ Go to sleep soundly, my dear. ~

01:31:15.734 --> 01:31:18.028
Apamu more pain?

01:31:19.863 --> 01:31:22.157
Do not take medicine with cold water.

01:31:22.616 --> 01:31:23.993
Can Just Click.

01:31:55.649 --> 01:31:58.402
~ In the darkness outside the window. ~

01:31:58.861 --> 01:32:04.366
~ That is not concealed ... ~

01:32:08.037 --> 01:32:08.495
How?

01:32:09.413 --> 01:32:10.789
As the lead singer, is pretty good.

01:32:12.166 --> 01:32:13.083
But why is that song?

01:32:14.001 --> 01:32:15.836
These are songs created her own?

01:32:19.965 --> 01:32:20.883
Wait a minute!

01:32:22.259 --> 01:32:24.553
The original song seems a little less suitable.

01:32:25.471 --> 01:32:27.306
I will be contacting composers song.

01:32:28.682 --> 01:32:29.600
Use them alone song.

01:32:30.059 --> 01:32:33.270
You guys know if this was a very important show for you guys, right?

01:32:34.188 --> 01:32:37.399
If you use this song may be a bit risky.

01:32:43.822 --> 01:32:45.199
Where and how risky?

01:32:46.575 --> 01:32:48.869
Let me know let us know.

01:32:51.163 --> 01:32:52.539
The song that you wrote ...

01:32:52.998 --> 01:32:55.292
created to imitate the style and character of Doo Ri.

01:32:55.751 --> 01:32:58.963
Still much better song "Life Underground" the first time you sing.

01:33:02.174 --> 01:33:05.386
The group name bands you "Ban Ji Ha (semi basement) Band"?

01:33:05.844 --> 01:33:07.221
Oh Doo Ri band instead?

01:33:13.644 --> 01:33:14.562
Where are you going?

01:33:14.562 --> 01:33:15.479
Do not come!

01:33:16.855 --> 01:33:18.691
What is it?

01:33:18.691 --> 01:33:21.902
PD-nim also for our own good.

01:33:21.902 --> 01:33:24.655
Kan can write it.

01:33:24.655 --> 01:33:25.573
I hear you spend the night at his house PD?

01:33:27.408 --> 01:33:27.867

01:33:28.784 --> 01:33:29.702
Do you sleep with him?

01:33:35.207 --> 01:33:37.960
Basic kunyuk! Where did you learn from these words?

01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:39.336
Why?

01:33:39.336 --> 01:33:42.548
I sleep, use the AC again.

01:33:42.548 --> 01:33:43.924
Convenient once.

01:33:47.595 --> 01:33:49.430
Yes, I sleep.

01:33:49.889 --> 01:33:54.018
There was air conditioning cold, my sleep soundly once.

01:33:54.018 --> 01:33:57.229
Yes, you were so damaged by too spoiled.

01:33:59.064 --> 01:33:59.982
Wake up!

01:34:05.029 --> 01:34:06.405
Sudan, makan!

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:09.617
Why do you treat me so?

01:34:10.534 --> 01:34:12.369
Today hot.

01:34:12.828 --> 01:34:14.663
What's so strange to eat chicken in a hot day?

01:34:17.416 --> 01:34:19.710
A quick meal! My arms were sore ya!

01:34:25.216 --> 01:34:26.133
Aigoo...

01:34:27.051 --> 01:34:29.345
Lately irregular eating alone.

01:34:30.262 --> 01:34:32.097
If you were to collapse,

01:34:32.097 --> 01:34:33.933
you also a disadvantage.

01:34:33.933 --> 01:34:34.391

01:34:35.768 --> 01:34:37.144
PD Han really going out with?

01:34:38.521 --> 01:34:40.356
You really like me?

01:34:43.108 --> 01:34:44.026
Sorry.

01:34:45.402 --> 01:34:48.614
You're not the type that I like.

01:34:49.073 --> 01:34:52.284
Do not dare to express your feelings as a man like.

01:34:52.284 --> 01:34:54.119
Work and personal problems you can not differentiate.

01:34:54.119 --> 01:34:55.955
Not able to control emotions.

01:34:55.955 --> 01:34:57.790
Making friends around you becomes saturated.

01:34:59.625 --> 01:35:00.543
Plus ...

01:35:01.001 --> 01:35:03.295
My least favorite thing ...

01:35:04.672 --> 01:35:06.966
You did not know ...

01:35:07.424 --> 01:35:09.260

01:35:22.565 --> 01:35:24.859

01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:31.282
Hey, who are you?

01:35:31.282 --> 01:35:32.199

01:35:33.117 --> 01:35:34.034

01:35:34.034 --> 01:35:36.328
Ban vocalist Ji Ha

01:35:36.787 --> 01:35:37.705
Oh Doo Ri.

01:35:47.339 --> 01:35:49.175
How do you live your life these days?

01:35:49.175 --> 01:35:52.386
Sometimes it can see you on TV, but you do not call.

01:35:52.845 --> 01:35:55.139
I'm a little confused.

01:35:57.892 --> 01:35:58.350
Lest ...

01:35:58.809 --> 01:36:01.103
there are people who love you?

01:36:02.938 --> 01:36:06.150
Why can all guess right direct?

01:36:07.526 --> 01:36:10.279
How long have I know at Agassi?

01:36:12.573 --> 01:36:15.326
Agassi also like it?

01:36:18.078 --> 01:36:19.914
It's been so long I do not have it.

01:36:21.749 --> 01:36:22.666
Start thinking

01:36:23.584 --> 01:36:25.878
The what?

01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:32.301
Part here is always out of control, and beating like.

01:36:33.677 --> 01:36:35.054
It was true for you too love it.

01:36:37.348 --> 01:36:39.183
I really envy him.

01:36:44.688 --> 01:36:45.606

01:36:55.241 --> 01:36:56.158
Thank you.

01:36:59.370 --> 01:37:01.205
But anyway ...

01:37:01.664 --> 01:37:04.875
Why not look the Ja Ok it?

01:37:07.169 --> 01:37:09.922
Old grandmother who does not drink coffee day America,

01:37:09.922 --> 01:37:12.675
mouth instantly grow spines.

01:37:12.675 --> 01:37:14.510
A few days ago she fainted.

01:37:15.428 --> 01:37:16.804
Cerebral hemorrhage.

01:37:16.804 --> 01:37:19.098
Why can?

01:37:19.098 --> 01:37:22.309
With age we are like this, what will happen tomorrow no one knows.

01:37:23.686 --> 01:37:26.439
Now Agassi does not have to worry anymore.

01:37:47.543 --> 01:37:48.461
The song tolerable.

01:37:51.672 --> 01:37:52.131
Home?

01:37:53.507 --> 01:37:54.425
Did you write?

01:37:54.884 --> 01:37:56.260
Been drinking again?

01:37:59.930 --> 01:38:00.848
Standing spirit yes!

01:38:01.766 --> 01:38:02.224
I came out first.

01:38:10.483 --> 01:38:12.318
Agassi peo ...

01:38:12.318 --> 01:38:14.153
is agassi who came to the house that day?

01:38:14.612 --> 01:38:15.071
Possess.

01:38:15.988 --> 01:38:16.447
Why?

01:38:16.906 --> 01:38:17.823
That's all right.

01:38:35.716 --> 01:38:39.387
~ Secretly ... secretly comes over. ~

01:38:39.387 --> 01:38:42.139
~ Come here, there ... ~

01:38:43.057 --> 01:38:43.974
Friends!

01:38:43.974 --> 01:38:44.892
Is okay!

01:38:44.892 --> 01:38:45.351
What?

01:38:45.810 --> 01:38:48.104
Special show next week, sing my song!

01:38:48.562 --> 01:38:49.939
Seriously?

01:38:49.939 --> 01:38:52.692
Familiar with the new future songwriter genius like me?

01:38:54.068 --> 01:38:56.362
Aigoo, hebat!

01:38:56.362 --> 01:38:57.738
Oppaku ...

01:38:57.738 --> 01:38:58.656
Great!

01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:01.867
Great!

01:39:06.914 --> 01:39:09.208
Everything is great!

01:39:14.255 --> 01:39:17.925
PD-nim, smooth hands once.

01:39:18.843 --> 01:39:19.301
Oh ya?

01:39:22.972 --> 01:39:27.560
But people say a man who has smooth hands, usually lazy.

01:39:28.019 --> 01:39:29.854
You're worried I'm too lazy to my wife's child hunger?

01:39:31.689 --> 01:39:32.606
Instead.

01:39:33.065 --> 01:39:35.818
PD-nim for this always straightforward.

01:39:36.277 --> 01:39:38.112
The person is also good.

01:39:43.617 --> 01:39:44.994
I quite?

01:39:49.123 --> 01:39:50.041
What?

01:39:50.041 --> 01:39:50.958
As a man.

01:39:54.170 --> 01:39:56.005
Anu...

01:39:56.464 --> 01:39:57.840
Anu...

01:39:59.216 --> 01:40:01.052
Too old.

01:40:02.428 --> 01:40:02.887
Possess.

01:40:03.804 --> 01:40:05.181
I was too old.

01:40:05.181 --> 01:40:07.475
Not so.

01:40:07.475 --> 01:40:11.145
My original figure was 4 ... Because of that ....

01:40:11.145 --> 01:40:12.521
- No grade 4 ... - Motherhood ...

01:40:12.521 --> 01:40:13.439
What?

01:40:14.815 --> 01:40:16.192
In self-Doo Ri,

01:40:18.027 --> 01:40:18.944
there is the shadow of my mother

01:40:19.403 --> 01:40:21.238
whose face no longer remember.

01:40:26.744 --> 01:40:27.662
Hair style is well suited to you.

01:40:44.637 --> 01:40:46.013
Thank you.

01:40:46.013 --> 01:40:48.307
I'll wait here for you, to take you home.

01:40:48.307 --> 01:40:51.519
Do not be. May be long.

01:40:52.436 --> 01:40:55.189
You must have been tired, go home first!

01:40:56.107 --> 01:40:57.024
Doo Ri!

01:41:14.458 --> 01:41:15.376
It's beautiful.

01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:37.398
Come on!

01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:09.055
How can you not know the name of the patient?

01:42:09.972 --> 01:42:14.560
I do not know what marganya.

01:42:15.937 --> 01:42:18.689
His name is Ok Ja.

01:42:19.607 --> 01:42:20.983
OK, and?

01:42:20.983 --> 01:42:23.277
He said a few days ago was taken to the hospital.

01:42:24.195 --> 01:42:26.030
It's here. His name Ja Ok Joo.

Gladiresiknya begins 10 minutes.

01:43:46.319 --> 01:43:47.695
Leader, yet appeared?

01:43:48.154 --> 01:43:49.071
Just a bit farther.

01:43:49.071 --> 01:43:50.448
There should not be any problem.

01:43:50.448 --> 01:43:52.742
Please confirmed its position where it is now!

01:43:55.495 --> 01:43:56.412
Why so late?

01:43:56.412 --> 01:43:58.247
He went to take a guitar that has been fixed.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.294
Almost there. Ten minutes again.

01:44:04.212 --> 01:44:05.588
Ten minutes might be a bit impossible.

01:44:05.588 --> 01:44:06.964
It's going to get even jam like this.

01:44:11.093 --> 01:44:11.552
Ajussi ...

01:44:12.011 --> 01:44:13.329
I'm down here alone.

01:44:24.857 --> 01:44:27.151
Hey, this is not a dream, right?

01:44:28.069 --> 01:44:30.363
We stage with them?

01:44:31.739 --> 01:44:34.033
People who inspired me holding drumsticks

01:44:34.033 --> 01:44:35.409
is he.

01:44:35.868 --> 01:44:37.245
Is out!

01:45:41.476 --> 01:45:42.852
As ji a miracle?

01:45:42.852 --> 01:45:43.770
Where?

01:45:58.451 --> 01:45:59.368
Seonbae ...

01:45:59.368 --> 01:46:00.745
Next is their turn.

01:46:01.662 --> 01:46:03.039
Time to take a decision.

01:46:09.921 --> 01:46:11.756
Performances may be canceled today.

01:46:12.215 --> 01:46:13.591
Should refer to hospital first!

01:46:14.509 --> 01:46:16.344
Let's get to the hospital!

01:46:16.803 --> 01:46:20.014
Having settled affairs here, I will soon follow.

01:46:22.308 --> 01:46:23.684
Sing it ...

01:46:28.272 --> 01:46:28.731
We ...

01:46:30.108 --> 01:46:31.484
singing alone.

01:46:33.319 --> 01:46:35.154
The song is written by Ji Ha ...

01:46:36.072 --> 01:46:38.366
we sing aloud ...

01:46:38.366 --> 01:46:39.742
be heard also by him.

01:46:50.294 --> 01:46:51.671
After that we ...

01:46:54.424 --> 01:46:56.259
let Ji Ha ...

01:47:03.141 --> 01:47:04.976
"Nice your song."

01:47:10.481 --> 01:47:11.399
Ji Ha ...

01:47:12.316 --> 01:47:13.234
Can you hear me?

01:47:16.904 --> 01:47:18.281
So many people ...

01:47:19.198 --> 01:47:21.492
'm waiting for our song.

01:47:23.786 --> 01:47:25.621
You made this song ...

01:47:26.998 --> 01:47:29.292
will kunyanyikan with all my soul.

01:47:30.209 --> 01:47:31.586
Because it ...

01:47:32.045 --> 01:47:33.880
Do not give up,

01:47:34.797 --> 01:47:35.715
Ha Ji.

01:47:59.113 --> 01:48:03.731
~ Today is filled with distress ... ~

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:08.748
~ Without realizing it turned into a day ago. ~

01:48:08.748 --> 01:48:11.042
~ Just as dawn is coming back toward him. ~

01:48:11.501 --> 01:48:14.253
Tomorrow morning ~ ... ~

01:48:14.253 --> 01:48:18.841
~ A bright hope will menyinarimu. ~

01:48:19.759 --> 01:48:22.970
~ Shoulder burdened ... ~

01:48:22.970 --> 01:48:25.264
Heavy footsteps ~ ... ~

01:48:25.723 --> 01:48:29.852
~ The menghantuimu in the darkness ... ~

01:48:31.229 --> 01:48:36.275
~ But without realizing it, the stars are twinkling ... ~

01:48:36.275 --> 01:48:39.487
~ As if showing the way you should go. ~

01:48:39.487 --> 01:48:44.993
~ Will menyinarimu and make you shine. ~

01:48:46.369 --> 01:48:49.122
~ Once again ... ~

01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:51.874
~ Yes, once again ... ~

01:48:52.333 --> 01:48:56.921
~ Although sometimes looks like a mirage teraih not ... ~

01:48:57.380 --> 01:48:59.674
~ Once again ... ~

01:49:00.591 --> 01:49:02.885
~ Yes, once again ... ~

01:49:03.344 --> 01:49:07.015
~ Do not ever stop running ... ~

01:49:07.015 --> 01:49:09.767
~ In the end, the dream will turn into reality. ~

01:49:09.767 --> 01:49:13.896
~ Singing to yourself that glitters. ~

01:49:36.836 --> 01:49:39.589
~ What I never owned yesterday ... ~

01:49:40.048 --> 01:49:42.342
~ The stars are glittering. ~

01:49:42.342 --> 01:49:45.094
~ As if telling happiness tomorrow. ~

01:49:45.094 --> 01:49:51.517
~ Will menyinarimu and make you shimmer. ~

01:49:52.435 --> 01:49:55.188
~ Once again ... ~

01:49:55.188 --> 01:49:57.482
~ Yes, once again ... ~

01:49:57.941 --> 01:50:00.234
~ Do not ever stop running ... ~

01:50:01.152 --> 01:50:04.364
~ In the end, the dream will turn into reality. ~

01:50:04.364 --> 01:50:08.952
~ Singing to yourself that glitters. ~

01:50:08.952 --> 01:50:11.704
~ Once again ... ~

01:50:11.704 --> 01:50:13.998
~ Yes, once again ... ~

01:50:14.457 --> 01:50:19.963
~ Running up the heart felt as if it would explode ... ~

01:50:19.963 --> 01:50:22.257
~ Once again ... ~

01:50:22.715 --> 01:50:25.468
~ Yes, once again ... ~

01:50:25.468 --> 01:50:30.974
~ Shine like a dazzling morning star. ~

01:50:30.974 --> 01:50:36.479
~ Once again ... The last time ... ~

01:50:36.479 --> 01:50:40.149
~ Do not ever stop running ... ~

01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:42.902
~ In the end, the dream will turn into reality. ~

01:50:42.902 --> 01:50:47.490
~ Singing to yourself that glitters. ~

01:51:25.111 --> 01:51:25.570
Doo Ri mana?

01:51:26.029 --> 01:51:27.405
Once completed directly to the hospital.

01:51:27.864 --> 01:51:28.781
We also want to get there again.

01:51:30.158 --> 01:51:33.369
RH-AB. It is appropriate to the patient's blood group?

01:51:33.828 --> 01:51:35.663
Blood is needed for the operation is not sufficient.

01:51:35.663 --> 01:51:37.040
Why could not there?

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:38.875
Why can a hospital no blood?

01:51:38.875 --> 01:51:42.545
Today many patients. Our hospital does not have inventory.

01:51:42.545 --> 01:51:44.380
Now we are contacting other hospitals.

01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:45.298
But this is too urgent.

01:51:45.298 --> 01:51:47.133
Family member is the same blood type?

01:51:48.051 --> 01:51:48.509
Grandma!

01:51:49.427 --> 01:51:50.803
Ji Ha and grandmother have the same blood type.

01:51:53.556 --> 01:51:54.933
How is this?

01:51:55.391 --> 01:51:56.309
How?

01:51:58.603 --> 01:52:01.814
I have the same blood type.

01:52:06.402 --> 01:52:08.238
The same blood with Ha Ji.

01:52:12.825 --> 01:52:13.743
What did you come here?

01:52:14.661 --> 01:52:16.037
What was in your mind?

01:52:16.496 --> 01:52:19.707
Ha Ji Cucuku ... to ...

01:52:19.707 --> 01:52:22.460
If your blood is taken, you will be instantly aging.

01:52:23.836 --> 01:52:25.672
What good is so old?

01:52:25.672 --> 01:52:29.342
What good facial skin wrinkles and body odor?

01:52:33.012 --> 01:52:33.471
I go first.

01:52:33.930 --> 01:52:36.683
Successfully become a singer like impanmu, are not you happy?

01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:39.894
Plus, the feeling sukamu on the person.

01:53:06.045 --> 01:53:07.881

01:53:08.339 --> 01:53:08.798

01:53:28.526 --> 01:53:29.444
Kenalkah?

01:53:33.114 --> 01:53:34.491
First-first ...

01:53:36.784 --> 01:53:39.078
there was a young woman without a husband

01:53:40.455 --> 01:53:41.831
who raise their children alone.

01:53:44.125 --> 01:53:46.878
But the child fell ill.

01:53:48.254 --> 01:53:50.089
His condition was not good.

01:53:51.466 --> 01:53:54.677
In a day several times a condition becomes critical.

01:53:56.054 --> 01:53:57.889
The mother of the child ...

01:53:59.724 --> 01:54:02.477
too poor and unable to do anything.

01:54:04.312 --> 01:54:05.230

01:54:06.606 --> 01:54:08.441
he embraced her tightly in his arms.

01:54:10.735 --> 01:54:12.111
Responding to tears ...

01:54:14.864 --> 01:54:15.782

01:54:27.252 --> 01:54:27.710
Wait a minute!

01:54:32.757 --> 01:54:33.675

01:54:55.238 --> 01:54:57.991
Do not eat seafood that smells fishy.

01:54:59.367 --> 01:55:00.743
Do not for the sake of the child,

01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:04.873
to live like a slave.

01:55:06.249 --> 01:55:08.543
Do not look for a short-age husband.

01:55:12.213 --> 01:55:12.672
Do not ...

01:55:14.966 --> 01:55:16.801
unfilial childbearing like.

01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:18.178
Do not ...

01:55:20.013 --> 01:55:20.930
Kumohon ...

01:55:23.683 --> 01:55:25.059
Quickly go, Mom ...

01:55:30.106 --> 01:55:31.024
No.

01:55:34.235 --> 01:55:35.612
Even if there is life after death,

01:55:37.906 --> 01:55:39.282
I'm not going to budge.

01:55:40.658 --> 01:55:42.035
I'm going to live like this.

01:55:48.458 --> 01:55:49.834
Even if it is bitter and wearisome ...

01:55:52.587 --> 01:55:54.422
I'm not going to change anything ...

01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:56.716
And live like it.

01:56:06.351 --> 01:56:10.480
You are a good son.

01:56:16.444 --> 01:56:17.362
Mother ...

01:56:18.279 --> 01:56:19.197

01:57:23.887 --> 01:57:26.181
