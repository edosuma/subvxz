WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:32.664 --> 01:33.688
Here they come.

01:37.269 --> 01:38.600
Are we there yet, father?

01:38.837 --> 01:39.963
What?

01:40.038 --> 01:42.768
Yes, dear... you can open your eyes.

01:42.908 --> 01:44.205
We... We've landed.

01:44.510 --> 01:47.145
Ileena!
I was wanting to your visit.

01:47.145 --> 01:48.247
Me too, Teela.

01:48.247 --> 01:51.239
I'm glad my dad had to
deliver the transmutator.

01:52.184 --> 01:54.253
Teela, Ileena, guess what?

01:54.253 --> 01:57.122
Jarvan the sorcerer has escaped
the prison mines...

01:57.122 --> 01:59.750
he could be on his way here right now!

02:00.025 --> 02:01.026
Why here?

02:01.026 --> 02:03.962
King Randor and He-Man
imprisoned him a long time ago...

02:03.962 --> 02:05.564
he swore revenge.

02:05.564 --> 02:07.566
Oh, do you think we're safe?

02:07.566 --> 02:11.195
Not to worry,
he's probably in another galaxy by now.

02:11.336 --> 02:12.394
Come, Ileena.

02:26.351 --> 02:29.752
Back on Eternia, at last.

02:29.821 --> 02:35.157
Now to find Randor and
He-Man and take my revenge.

02:40.232 --> 02:43.759
Someone's coming.
I don't want to be seen, just yet...

02:43.835 --> 02:46.065
this will frighten them away.

02:48.006 --> 02:49.598
I think, this is the way.

02:51.577 --> 02:52.976
Oh no!

02:54.846 --> 02:56.315
Geyser Field.

02:56.315 --> 02:58.783
Hurry, before the gas overcomes us.

03:03.221 --> 03:04.518
Ileena, come on.

03:08.894 --> 03:11.829
Teela, help. I'm frightened.

03:23.075 --> 03:25.009
Teela, what happened?

03:29.615 --> 03:32.050
Adam, Teela and Ileena aren't back yet.

03:32.050 --> 03:35.354
They're probably enjoying themselves.
If it'll make you feel better...

03:35.354 --> 03:37.322
I'll call Teela on the comm-link.

03:37.322 --> 03:38.322
Teela...

03:39.858 --> 03:41.416
Teela, can you hear me?

03:43.462 --> 03:46.920
Adam, help...
we're trapped in the Geyser Field.

03:46.999 --> 03:48.466
Teela may be hurt.

03:50.836 --> 03:53.930
Hold on, Ileena, try to stay calm.
I'll send for help.

03:55.474 --> 03:57.499
By the power of Grayskull.

04:04.449 --> 04:07.282
I have the power!

04:30.008 --> 04:32.611
Don't move.
This won't hurt a bit.

04:32.611 --> 04:33.611
He-Man!

04:53.598 --> 04:54.598
He-Man.

05:01.907 --> 05:03.397
It'll be alright now.

05:03.475 --> 05:04.635
Oh, thank you.

05:06.044 --> 05:07.841
I was so frightened.

05:08.947 --> 05:10.949
If only I were more like Teela...

05:10.949 --> 05:13.118
this wouldn't have happened.

05:13.118 --> 05:14.779
Let's get Teela home.

05:19.991 --> 05:23.449
Let's go, Battle Cat. Quickly but gently.

05:24.730 --> 05:27.290
He will lead me to the King,

05:27.866 --> 05:31.427
Then I will make them both
pay for sending me away.

05:33.505 --> 05:37.305
It just isn't fair.
My father can make anything.

05:37.375 --> 05:39.809
Why can't he make me big and strong?

05:40.031 --> 05:41.031
Why? [cries]

05:43.915 --> 05:47.544
So, this little one needs help...

05:47.986 --> 05:49.920
I will help her...

05:52.224 --> 05:54.386
to help me.

05:54.411 --> 05:56.582
But first, a disguise.

06:00.398 --> 06:02.958
What's wrong, deary?

06:04.503 --> 06:05.765
Who are you?

06:07.038 --> 06:10.030
Just an old woman, dear...

06:10.108 --> 06:12.008
What's wrong, child?

06:12.377 --> 06:14.470
Because I'm so weak and timid...

06:14.546 --> 06:18.448
my friend got hurt.
Oh, I wish I could be stronger.

06:19.117 --> 06:22.171
Oh, is that all that's bothering you?

06:22.196 --> 06:25.007
I can fix that, deary.

06:26.457 --> 06:28.049
You can?

06:31.396 --> 06:35.059
But...
but, I don't know what it is.

06:35.667 --> 06:39.194
It will make you feel
anything you want to feel...

06:39.271 --> 06:41.967
Strong, tall, anything.

06:44.442 --> 06:45.932
Feel better?

06:48.280 --> 06:49.872
How can I thank you?

06:50.248 --> 06:53.581
Oh, I'll think of something.

06:53.919 --> 06:55.250
Ileena!

06:55.420 --> 06:56.587
Take this,

06:56.612 --> 06:59.880
...with it you can call me.

07:00.091 --> 07:04.425
Just say: Em ot emoc.

07:05.197 --> 07:07.131
Ileena, where are you?

07:07.632 --> 07:10.166
I'm here, Teela.
How are you?

07:10.202 --> 07:13.605
Oh, I'm all recovered.
But what are you doing up there?

07:13.605 --> 07:15.835
Here, let me help you down. You'll fall.

07:15.907 --> 07:18.171
No, I won't, and what's more...

07:18.343 --> 07:20.038
I'm not afraid.

07:22.147 --> 07:24.377
I never knew you could do that.

07:24.516 --> 07:28.709
[laughs] I didn't either.
Let's go back. I'll race ya.

07:32.824 --> 07:34.553
This is the transmutator.

07:34.626 --> 07:38.819
It can change things from solid
to liquid or gas. Watch the tree.

07:40.898 --> 07:44.434
The tree has been changed from
wood to gold.

07:44.469 --> 07:46.334
It can change it back.

07:50.507 --> 07:53.067
I must have that machine,

07:53.711 --> 07:56.703
and I know a good idea, how to get it.

07:58.016 --> 07:59.415
Are you alright Ileena?

07:59.484 --> 08:02.420
What?  Yes, fine.

08:02.420 --> 08:04.756
Why don't you get some fresh air?
Adam and I will...

08:04.756 --> 08:06.391
join you in a while.

08:06.391 --> 08:07.391
I, I will.

08:07.959 --> 08:09.994
She was fine just a short while ago...

08:09.994 --> 08:11.521
but now she looks almost ill.

08:13.198 --> 08:16.292
I feel so sick, so tired and weak.

08:17.435 --> 08:20.165
Maybe that kind old woman can help.

08:20.505 --> 08:22.530
What were those words again?

08:22.907 --> 08:25.740
Em ot emoc.

08:28.813 --> 08:31.304
Yes, deary, you called?

08:32.417 --> 08:34.317
Oh, where did you come from?

08:35.352 --> 08:39.380
What does that matter? I'm here.
What's wrong?

08:40.291 --> 08:43.828
Oh, I feel awful, I thought...

08:43.828 --> 08:45.659
maybe some more potion?

08:45.997 --> 08:47.328
Of course, deary.

08:52.103 --> 08:55.773
Adam, I think we better find
Ileena, I'm worried about her.

08:55.773 --> 08:57.741
Just what I was thinking. Let's go.

08:59.978 --> 09:01.206
Ileena!

09:01.379 --> 09:02.744
Hi Adam, Teela!

09:03.648 --> 09:06.584
How are you feeling?
Oh I'm fine, I'm just terrific.

09:06.584 --> 09:10.021
In fact I feel so good I think I'll do
something I've always wanted to do...

09:10.021 --> 09:12.991
I think I'll take my father's
Air Car for a ride. Wanna come?

09:12.991 --> 09:14.792
Have you flown it before?

09:14.792 --> 09:17.128
Are you sure you know how?

09:17.128 --> 09:19.864
Of course, I can do anything Adam...
Want to come?

09:19.864 --> 09:21.161
Sure, Ileena!

09:32.243 --> 09:34.211
Ileena, slow down.

09:34.712 --> 09:36.245
Oh Adam, don't be such a fun-stopper.

09:40.318 --> 09:42.411
Ileena, try to land.

09:43.121 --> 09:45.419
I can't... I don't know what to do.

09:46.624 --> 09:49.427
How did I ever get myself
into a fix like this?

09:49.427 --> 09:52.590
But more importantly, how do I get out?

10:00.939 --> 10:03.237
Oh!  Hang on, Adam.

10:12.684 --> 10:14.584
By the power of Grayskull.

10:15.620 --> 10:18.214
I have the power!

10:44.349 --> 10:45.750
I feel sick.

10:45.750 --> 10:48.086
You should, that was a wild ride.

10:48.086 --> 10:50.622
Tell me, have you ever flown this before?

10:50.622 --> 10:51.919
No, I, never have.

10:52.223 --> 10:55.590
That was very dangerous,
Ileena, and not very smart.

10:56.261 --> 10:57.319
Adam!

10:57.562 --> 11:00.827
Adam is safe. Come on!
You can use some rest.

11:04.068 --> 11:05.763
I feel so terrible.

11:06.070 --> 11:09.062
There's only one thing that
will make me feel better.

11:09.707 --> 11:12.369
Em ot emoc.

11:13.044 --> 11:14.409
Yes deary.

11:14.846 --> 11:18.976
Please, I feel awful.
Can I have some more potion?

11:20.051 --> 11:24.647
Not this time, sweetie.
It's time you paid me back.

11:25.256 --> 11:26.256
How?

11:26.324 --> 11:28.355
I want the transmutator.

11:28.359 --> 11:32.261
I can't pass the voice print, but you can.

11:32.563 --> 11:35.760
Get the transmutator for me.

11:36.067 --> 11:37.466
I won't do that.

11:37.769 --> 11:41.967
If you want some of that nice
potion, you will.

11:43.408 --> 11:46.406
She's gone.
Oh, how did I ever get myself into this?

11:47.411 --> 11:50.273
I wish I'd never drank that potion.

11:56.988 --> 11:59.388
Ileena, please tell me what's wrong.

12:00.658 --> 12:02.216
I can't, Adam.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.990
I can't help if you won't let me.

12:06.130 --> 12:07.961
I have to have more potion.

12:08.833 --> 12:11.927
But I can't steal
father's transmutator...

12:12.203 --> 12:15.290
But, if I bring her the transmutator,

12:15.315 --> 12:17.529
once I drink the potion, I'll be strong...

12:17.775 --> 12:19.333
enough to take it back.

12:20.511 --> 12:22.809
How did I get myself into this trouble.

12:24.649 --> 12:27.074
Please, open the door, I'm Ileena.

12:27.785 --> 12:30.754
Voice print matches, you may enter.

12:34.892 --> 12:37.622
There's no one here. Oh, thank goodness.

12:39.197 --> 12:40.528
It's too heavy.

12:41.766 --> 12:44.132
I saw you come in, need some help?

12:45.970 --> 12:50.339
Yes. I...
I need to take this to.. the terrace...

12:51.209 --> 12:53.143
Then I'd like to be alone, Orko.

12:53.277 --> 12:54.710
Your wish is my command.

12:57.382 --> 13:00.408
Now you can push it on to the
terrace, the spell will wear off...

13:00.485 --> 13:03.181
when you set it down. Bye.

13:05.957 --> 13:08.357
Em ot emoc.

13:11.028 --> 13:13.155
Well done, deary.

13:13.998 --> 13:16.262
Please, the potion.

13:17.835 --> 13:20.565
No, I don't think so.

13:20.905 --> 13:23.430
Please, I need your help.

13:24.342 --> 13:27.470
But I no longer need yours...

13:27.545 --> 13:31.606
I think Jarvan was too smart for you.

13:36.521 --> 13:38.682
Jarvan?  He tricked me.

13:39.457 --> 13:44.219
I've go to... warn... the others.

13:47.031 --> 13:50.626
It's gone, it's gone, it's vanished.

13:51.035 --> 13:52.904
What's gone, Zicran?

13:52.904 --> 13:57.864
The transmutator.
Someone stole the transmutator.

13:58.142 --> 14:00.167
Man-At-Arms, Teela.  Come quick!

14:00.244 --> 14:02.269
Somethings happened to Ileena!

14:05.583 --> 14:07.016
She's coming to now.

14:07.218 --> 14:11.213
Oh father, I did something awful.

14:11.722 --> 14:14.418
There, there now... what is it?

14:14.625 --> 14:17.992
I gave the transmutator
to Jarvan, the sorcerer.

14:23.935 --> 14:26.130
By the power of Grayskull.

14:32.977 --> 14:35.775
I have the power!

14:44.922 --> 14:48.085
Now that I've gotten He-Man's attention...

14:48.159 --> 14:50.252
I'll have my revenge.

15:02.807 --> 15:05.298
You'll have to aim better than
that, Jarvan.

15:05.610 --> 15:07.441
Alright, try this!

15:11.549 --> 15:14.775
Your marksmanship leaves me cold, Jarvan.

15:16.420 --> 15:19.116
A little heat should slow you down.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.754
Run through that, He-Man.

15:30.501 --> 15:32.550
Why go through it...

15:32.575 --> 15:34.622
when I can go over it!

15:37.208 --> 15:40.268
Good move, He-Man. But not good enough.

15:43.447 --> 15:45.438
The flash!  I can't see.

15:45.516 --> 15:48.815
You may able to see in a moment, He-Man.

15:50.521 --> 15:52.785
And you'll see, that you've lost.

15:53.157 --> 15:56.524
Yes, this transmutator
is a wonderful thing.

15:56.761 --> 15:59.753
It can turn the air around you to rock...

16:00.197 --> 16:05.227
or shrink the palace down
to a more managable size.

16:10.007 --> 16:12.669
I can't deactivate the transmutator.

16:14.345 --> 16:16.677
The... the palace is shrinking.

16:18.416 --> 16:20.816
I got to break free.

16:26.824 --> 16:31.283
Oh, I think it's time,
to turn on my force field.

16:33.664 --> 16:36.701
I can't take the time to
break through the force field...

16:36.701 --> 16:38.430
I've got to save the palace.

16:40.738 --> 16:43.741
Maybe if I can hold the center
of the Palace, I can stop....

16:43.741 --> 16:45.208
the whole thing from shrinking

16:45.677 --> 16:48.168
I've come through tight spots before.

16:53.318 --> 16:55.718
I could use a bit more elbow room.

16:56.688 --> 16:58.656
It's getting awfully crowded here.

17:00.792 --> 17:02.987
He-Man is holding this back.

17:07.330 --> 17:08.598
But even He-Man...

17:08.598 --> 17:11.762
won't be able to fight
the machine's full power.

17:24.415 --> 17:25.939
Is everyone alright?

17:26.150 --> 17:27.318
What happened?

17:27.318 --> 17:30.621
He-Man's resistance made the
Transmutator overload....

17:30.621 --> 17:31.656
and it blew up.

17:31.656 --> 17:33.351
Might over matter, right?

17:34.025 --> 17:36.493
It is not over yet.  Look!

17:39.629 --> 17:41.859
Jarvan's stunned, but he'll be back.

17:42.032 --> 17:44.635
If only there were a
way to bring him here...

17:44.635 --> 17:45.635
while he's still weak.

17:45.803 --> 17:48.406
Jarvan gave me this
ring to summon him with.

17:48.406 --> 17:50.408
Why did he do that, Ileena?

17:50.408 --> 17:54.469
I felt weak and timid.
Jarvan gave me a potion...

17:54.545 --> 17:58.112
and then said that it would
make me strong... and brave.

17:58.416 --> 17:59.416
And did it?

17:59.484 --> 18:03.250
It made me feel good at first,
but it wore off...

18:03.321 --> 18:05.585
and I needed more and more.

18:05.656 --> 18:08.259
He made you dependent
on some kind of drug.

18:08.259 --> 18:10.193
You're lucky you did'nt continue.

18:10.528 --> 18:12.052
I know that now.

18:14.264 --> 18:16.433
If we can rig up an amplifier, maybe...

18:16.433 --> 18:18.835
we could use this ring to summon him,

18:18.835 --> 18:22.134
and amplify its summoning
power to keep him here.

18:25.409 --> 18:27.240
It's ready now, Ileena.

18:30.748 --> 18:31.872
Now, Ileena.

18:31.983 --> 18:34.577
Em ot emoc.

18:40.524 --> 18:43.550
He-Man, you brought me here...

18:43.627 --> 18:46.061
but you can't make me stay.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.491
I can if that's all you've got Jarvan.

18:55.472 --> 18:57.872
Playing with fire eh, Jarvan?

19:02.513 --> 19:05.209
Give up, Jarvan. You can't win.

19:05.849 --> 19:08.716
Maybe not, but I never lose.

19:37.413 --> 19:39.278
Have a nice trip, Jarvan?

19:39.783 --> 19:43.947
You haven't heard the last of me, He-Man!

19:44.154 --> 19:46.790
Aw, you mean you'll write
to me from the prison mine.

19:47.992 --> 19:50.756
Thanks for helping me to catch
Jarvan, Ileena.

19:50.828 --> 19:52.386
That was very brave.

19:52.963 --> 19:55.232
What I did earlier was very stupid.

19:55.232 --> 19:58.369
I still don't understand why
you took the potion, Ileena.

19:58.369 --> 20:00.270
I wanted to be like you, Teela.

20:00.270 --> 20:01.639
I think you two will agree...

20:01.739 --> 20:03.308
that the only way
to feel good...

20:03.308 --> 20:06.472
is to first, feel good about yourself.

20:30.367 --> 20:33.604
In today's story,
Ileena tried taking a magic potion...

20:33.604 --> 20:35.406
which she thought would help her.

20:35.406 --> 20:38.442
Well, she found out there
aren't any magic potions.

20:38.442 --> 20:39.810
And you know what?

20:39.810 --> 20:42.046
There aren't any magic drugs either.

20:42.046 --> 20:44.648
Any time you take one from anybody...

20:44.648 --> 20:47.051
but your parents or your doctor,
you're taking a very big...

20:47.051 --> 20:50.220
chance. You're gambling with your health,

20:50.220 --> 20:51.922
maybe even your life.

20:51.922 --> 20:54.447
Drugs don't make your problems go away...

20:54.591 --> 20:56.684
they just create more.
