09:48.718 --> 09:51.765
he was driving,
there was a storm,

09:51.808 --> 09:53.418
he took a turn too fast.

09:53.462 --> 09:55.682
And then
he started

09:55.725 --> 09:57.466
acting out.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.947
At first I thought
it was just grief.

And then maybe...

10:02.384 --> 10:04.429
maybe drugs or something.

10:04.473 --> 10:07.650
And then he threw
a 200-pound lawnmower 50 feet

10:07.694 --> 10:09.478
across the yard.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.480
That was when our foster parents
called in the priest.

10:11.523 --> 10:14.004
I guess they thought
he was possessed

10:14.048 --> 10:15.745
by the devil.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.269

10:18.313 --> 10:22.056

11:25.859 --> 11:27.599
MG, did you do it wrong?No, I didn'’t do it wrong.

11:27.643 --> 11:29.210
It'’s the easiest vampire trick
in the book.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.778
Well, it didn'’t work.Obviously, it didn'’t work.

11:35.564 --> 11:36.521
Careful.

11:36.565 --> 11:38.132
Get him to the cellar.

11:38.175 --> 11:39.611
This is not good. This is bad.

12:09.511 --> 12:11.774
WOMAN:
No!

12:11.818 --> 12:14.037
MAN: Let me... WOMAN: No!

12:14.081 --> 12:15.822
You sit here and think about it.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.781
Please, don'’t lock me in here!

12:18.825 --> 12:19.956
Please!

12:21.044 --> 12:23.612
HOPE:
Landon.
Hope.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.570
Can you get me out of here?

12:25.614 --> 12:28.356
Not yet. But you'’re not
a prisoner here, I swear.

12:28.399 --> 12:30.314
I'’m in a witch dungeon.

12:30.358 --> 12:31.968
It'’s a werewolf
transition space.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.491
Super.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.102
I'’m not so good
with, you know...

12:35.145 --> 12:38.148
small spaces.We won'’t keep you here long.

12:38.192 --> 12:40.150
No one expected
you couldn'’t be compelled.

12:40.194 --> 12:41.586
I don'’t know what that means.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.284
MG tried to erase your memories
of this place,

12:43.327 --> 12:44.894
but it didn'’t work.

12:44.938 --> 12:48.419
So now what, I'’m a hostage?
Where'’s Rafi?

12:48.463 --> 12:50.595
He'’s fine. You're fine, too.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.119
Look, compulsion doesn'’t work

12:52.162 --> 12:54.121
on people who take this herb
called vervain.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.644
The town sheriff sometimes

12:55.687 --> 12:57.124
slips it into the coffee
at the gas station

12:57.167 --> 12:58.647
we were at this morning.

12:58.690 --> 13:01.215
It takes about a day
to pass through your system,

13:01.258 --> 13:03.043
but you just have
to wait it out.

13:03.086 --> 13:06.089
Sure.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.438
Yeah, no big deal.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.614
Yeah, I'’ll just sit here

13:09.658 --> 13:12.617
alone in the witch dungeon
with my thoughts.

13:17.057 --> 13:19.450
Would you...

13:19.494 --> 13:22.497
I mean...

13:22.540 --> 13:24.934
could you wait it out with me?

13:28.895 --> 13:32.289
I'’m really sorry
about all of this.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.509
But it was nice
to see you again.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.560
Whoa, move!

13:55.835 --> 13:57.749
Alyssa Chang made a broom
fly in physics last year,

13:57.793 --> 13:59.926
but Rick Rogers fell 30
feet during practice,

13:59.969 --> 14:02.580
so real-life Quidditch remains
an elusive pipe dream.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.408
It'’s called Wickery.

14:04.452 --> 14:07.803
My parents invented it
when we were ten.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.979
Their version is a little less
violent than ours.Hey.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.241
Yo.

14:11.285 --> 14:14.070
Giving up dibs on the
new guy so quickly?

14:14.114 --> 14:15.985
It'’s not a competition.

14:16.029 --> 14:18.683
Plus, I'’m still nursing
a wounded soul.

14:18.727 --> 14:20.860
Hmm. Penelope Park.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.166
We don'’t mention her name
anymore, remember?

14:23.210 --> 14:24.864
Sorry.

14:26.996 --> 14:29.781
Do you think he'’ll go for her?

14:29.825 --> 14:33.220
Probably. They usually do.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.353
Okay.

14:36.397 --> 14:39.226
I heard about what happened
to your girlfriend.

14:40.575 --> 14:43.056
Oh, I have spies everywhere.

14:43.099 --> 14:47.321
I'’m nosy in that,
like, charming way.

14:47.364 --> 14:49.453
Thanks, I guess.

14:49.497 --> 14:50.933
On the plus side,
we'’re all happy

14:50.977 --> 14:52.674
to know that you'’re single.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.547
Oh, God.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.549
That was my inside voice.

14:58.593 --> 15:00.725
I am so sorry.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.379
Guys like you make me nervous.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.294
Guys like me?
You know.

15:04.338 --> 15:05.948
Hot.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.210
Angry.

15:07.254 --> 15:10.213
Damaged.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.737
Yeah, well,

15:12.781 --> 15:14.870
I sort of made a
point in my life

15:14.914 --> 15:17.655
of, uh, keeping clear
of girls like you.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.396
So I guess

15:19.440 --> 15:20.745
I'’m gonna go find Landon.

15:26.664 --> 15:29.624
You didn'’t have to
lock him in the cellar.Where else was I gonna put him?

15:30.973 --> 15:32.888
Block with your hand.I got it.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.934
If you had it, I
wouldn'’t have to say it.

15:38.981 --> 15:40.113
Dimiterre.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.119
Cheater.

15:46.162 --> 15:48.730
You should really let a vampire
start doing my training.

15:48.773 --> 15:51.254
You'’re getting a little old for
me to break your human bones.

15:51.298 --> 15:52.777
How dare you?

15:55.041 --> 15:57.739
You and Landon have
a thing or something?

15:57.782 --> 16:00.350
I don'’t have things.Yes, I'’m well
aware of your quest

16:00.394 --> 16:01.961
to avoid all emotional intimacy.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.745
There was obviously something.

16:05.181 --> 16:06.835
I liked him.

16:06.878 --> 16:09.011
He'’s normal.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.753
Well, let'’s keep him that way.

16:11.796 --> 16:14.321
We survive here
because we follow the rules.

16:14.364 --> 16:16.149
We can'’t get sloppy about it.

16:16.192 --> 16:17.715
You'’re the one
that'’s always telling me

16:17.759 --> 16:19.021
I need to get out more.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.154
I tell you that you need
to stop locking yourself

16:21.197 --> 16:23.156
in your dorm room binge-watching
Cutthroat Kitchen.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.766
I don'’t tell you
to go out and fraternize

16:24.809 --> 16:26.072
with the human locals.

16:26.115 --> 16:27.856
You know, you can just be
my headmaster.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.684
All this other stuff isn'’t
in the job description.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.512
Attempt to make
an actual friend here,

16:31.555 --> 16:34.341
and we could reevaluate
this relationship.JOSIE: Dad?

This guy who used to
mess with me in school

this is lame.
You nearly

21:47.131 --> 21:49.351
gave me a tracheotomy
with a bread knife.

21:49.395 --> 21:50.700

21:53.268 --> 21:54.704
Hmm.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.402
You know,
I could just whip up a remedy

21:56.445 --> 21:58.099
with some herbs
from the bio lab.
No.

21:58.142 --> 21:59.709
No. No magic.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.711
Your magic gets you
into these states,

22:01.755 --> 22:05.498

to get you out of them.

22:13.636 --> 22:15.595

22:17.031 --> 22:20.426

Of course not.

I think your
biological mother'’s

22:28.390 --> 22:31.175

22:31.219 --> 22:33.003

It'’s a supernatural
phenomenon called

22:41.229 --> 22:43.144

22:43.187 --> 22:45.015
she got it
from my side of the family.

22:45.059 --> 22:47.409
I just...

22:47.453 --> 22:50.978
I don'’t ever want
to hurt anybody.

22:51.021 --> 22:53.154
I know that, honey.

22:54.329 --> 22:56.113
That'’s why
we opened this school,

22:56.157 --> 22:58.594
to learn control, which

22:58.638 --> 23:01.031
is why I'’m here now
to help, okay?

23:01.075 --> 23:02.816

23:02.859 --> 23:04.818

of the private training sessions

23:04.861 --> 23:06.733
you'’ve been doing
with Hope Mikaelson.Maybe

23:06.776 --> 23:09.039
if you made friends,
we could do group training.

23:09.083 --> 23:11.172

39:03.993 --> 39:06.909
Find someone else.

39:10.478 --> 39:13.133
This stuff with
Landon is my fault.

39:13.176 --> 39:14.743
I can fix it.
I know how to track him,

39:14.787 --> 39:16.963
but it involves
using a dark magic.

39:17.006 --> 39:19.400
Well, we'’re not allowed
to use dark magic here, so...

39:19.444 --> 39:21.271
Says the girl who just lit
her ex on fire.

39:21.315 --> 39:23.012
Are you blackmailing me?

39:23.056 --> 39:24.536
No.

39:24.579 --> 39:29.410
No, I'’m just looking for
a kindred spirit in revenge.

39:40.203 --> 39:42.728
Sorry.

40:07.013 --> 40:09.755
Are you sure about this?

40:09.798 --> 40:11.974
Absolutely.

40:15.369 --> 40:19.504
Inveniet hostium et tenebrae.

40:19.547 --> 40:22.507
Inveniet hostium
et tenebrae.

40:22.550 --> 40:26.641
Inveniet hostium et tenebrae.

40:28.295 --> 40:30.558
Do you see anything?Just flashes.

40:33.126 --> 40:35.433
Come on, give me something.

40:38.479 --> 40:40.176
I got it. Route 29.

40:40.220 --> 40:41.787
HOPE:
Near the state line.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.836
Is that the knife?
Yeah.

40:48.924 --> 40:50.448
JOSIE:
What'’s it doing?

40:50.491 --> 40:52.145
I have no idea.

41:03.635 --> 41:05.201
DONOVAN: Called in a favor
with a buddy at State Patrol,

41:05.245 --> 41:07.290
asked him to lock down the scene
till we got here.

41:07.334 --> 41:09.467
Local PD thinks
it was a chemical spill.

41:09.510 --> 41:12.034
What'’s the actual story?

41:12.078 --> 41:15.298
I'’ll leave that to you
to figure out.

41:15.342 --> 41:18.780
All right. Thanks, Sheriff.

41:18.824 --> 41:20.956
HOPE:
Funny how life works.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.958
After years
of pushing people away,

41:23.002 --> 41:24.960
I opened my heart
to Landon Kirby,

41:25.004 --> 41:26.962
the human in the wrong place
at the right time

41:27.006 --> 41:29.182
who just needed
a place to belong.

41:29.225 --> 41:33.491
Turns out, Landon isn'’t
the hero of my story at all.

41:43.370 --> 41:45.154
But when I hunt him down,

41:45.198 --> 41:50.029
I'’m gonna be
the villain of his.
