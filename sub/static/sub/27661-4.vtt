I was fired today.

18:24.505 --> 18:25.380
- Yeah, I...

18:25.422 --> 18:28.964
I told them you stole from me.

18:29.005 --> 18:31.088
- I guess you're not wrong.

18:31.130 --> 18:32.255
- So I was--
- With him--

18:32.297 --> 18:34.547
Please, go.
- Yeah, I'm gonna go.

18:34.589 --> 18:36.380
Uh, I've been thinking a lot
about what I'd say to you...

18:36.422 --> 18:39.005
when I saw you.

18:39.047 --> 18:42.589
I had a lot of very mean
speeches prepared.

18:42.631 --> 18:45.088
I even fantasized about just...

18:45.130 --> 18:46.923
hitting you over and over again,

18:46.964 --> 18:49.088
like in the face with a fist,
the whole deal,

18:49.130 --> 18:50.923
maybe rings...

18:50.964 --> 18:52.214
like in bloodsport.

18:52.255 --> 18:56.923
Now you're right in front of me
and it feels...

18:56.964 --> 18:58.505
[sighs] it feels different.

19:00.214 --> 19:01.923
Look, were you and Nathan
in love?

19:04.505 --> 19:05.881
- No.

19:07.172 --> 19:10.797
I mean, I thought I was, but...

19:10.839 --> 19:12.047
I always think I am
at the beginning.

19:14.589 --> 19:17.172
I promise, we weren't.

19:17.214 --> 19:20.589
I think that we were both
just really sad.

19:20.631 --> 19:23.923
- Yeah. Yeah.

19:23.964 --> 19:26.005
- I understand if you hate me.

19:26.047 --> 19:28.881
Maybe...

19:28.923 --> 19:31.088
maybe I hate me.

19:31.130 --> 19:32.714
- I don't hate you.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.464
I don't wanna feel anything
about you.

19:36.964 --> 19:38.714
Hey, how 'bout this.

19:38.756 --> 19:41.380
I'd really like to not to have
to see your face again.

19:41.422 --> 19:43.005
But I'm gonna make that
your problem.

19:43.047 --> 19:45.672
Deal?

19:47.297 --> 19:49.047
