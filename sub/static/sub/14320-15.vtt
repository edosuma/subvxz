01:03.458 --> 01:05.625
GUARD 1: Can you
believe this heat?

01:05.625 --> 01:08.166
GUARD 2: It's not the heat,
it's the humidity.

01:08.166 --> 01:11.000
There you go again.
Every night the same thing!

01:11.000 --> 01:13.833
I say heat, you say humidity.

01:13.833 --> 01:15.708
Yeah, well, it's true.

01:15.708 --> 01:18.333
GUARD 1: It's midnight,
and it's still 97 degrees.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.583
That, to me, is heat.

01:20.583 --> 01:24.500
GUARD 2: Yeah, but it's
the humidity that's
making you uncomfortable.

01:24.500 --> 01:27.458
GUARD 1: No, the humidity
just makes me wet.

01:27.458 --> 01:30.166
You are making me uncomfortable.

01:30.166 --> 01:31.458
You're just bored.

01:31.458 --> 01:33.250
Bored?

01:33.250 --> 01:37.583
Guarding an empty warehouse?
I just can't take the...

01:38.583 --> 01:41.708
(SHIVERING) Say,
it's getting cold in here.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.333
(ALARM BEEPING)

01:52.333 --> 01:57.000
Just as I thought.
A faulty AE-35 unit.
We'll need a replacement.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.583
No prob! I'll just hop
in one of the mini-jets

01:59.583 --> 02:01.583
-and pick up a spare at the...
-Jubilee.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.583
Busted.

02:03.583 --> 02:06.458
You know you're not
authorized to fly
the mini-jets solo.

02:06.458 --> 02:07.958
But I'm ready!

02:07.958 --> 02:10.583
Not according to
your simulator tests.

02:10.583 --> 02:14.625
Jubilee, you can't
keep acting like
some impulsive child.

02:14.625 --> 02:16.833
Well, maybe if you'd stop
treating me like one.

02:16.833 --> 02:17.958
I didn't catch that?

02:17.958 --> 02:19.458
CEREBRO: Attention.

02:19.458 --> 02:22.125
I am registering
violent mutant activity.

02:22.125 --> 02:25.708
Scanning federal satellite
transmissions to corroborate.

02:25.708 --> 02:27.708
What type of
installation is that?

02:27.708 --> 02:30.750
Property is identified
as a federal storage depot.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.708
Restricted access.

02:32.708 --> 02:36.250
Can you determine
the nature of the
attacking mutant's powers?

02:36.250 --> 02:38.291
Formation and
manipulation of ice.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.708
But Storm's in Africa.

02:44.458 --> 02:46.500
Mutant has been identified.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.458
That's Bobby.

02:49.458 --> 02:54.208
Robert Drake.
Also known as Iceman.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.416
-(ALARM BLARING)
-(GRUNTS)

03:00.333 --> 03:01.875
I hate when I do that.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.958
X-Men! Assemble at
theBlackbird at once!

03:08.166 --> 03:10.000
Professor, what's our situation?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.375
I'll explain
once we're airborne.

03:12.375 --> 03:14.375
This better be good.

03:14.375 --> 03:17.333
If I don't get
a full night's sleep,
I'm cranky all day.

03:17.333 --> 03:19.708
Mansion's all locked up.
Let's jet!

03:19.708 --> 03:22.291
No, Jubilee. You stay here
and prepare the infirmary

03:22.291 --> 03:23.875
in case we need it.

03:23.875 --> 03:25.708
-But...
-That's an order, young lady.

03:25.708 --> 03:29.625
The infirmary?
What am I, a candy striper?

03:33.125 --> 03:36.166
It's just like before.
The guy is trouble.

03:36.166 --> 03:37.708
He's an X-Man.

03:37.708 --> 03:39.250
Was.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.625
What are we up against
with this Iceman?

03:41.625 --> 03:43.416
We're not against him,
Wolverine.

03:43.416 --> 03:45.000
So then we're with him?

03:45.000 --> 03:48.458
Of course not! He's destroying
federal property!

03:48.458 --> 03:50.708
Boy, I'm glad
we cleared that up.

03:50.708 --> 03:53.583
Bobby was one of
the original X-Men.

03:53.583 --> 03:56.000
Until he left.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.125
(CHUCKLES)

03:57.125 --> 04:00.250
Left? As in quit or canned?

04:00.250 --> 04:02.708
Bobby was difficult.

04:02.708 --> 04:05.250
Always up to some mischief.

04:05.250 --> 04:06.708
But never like this.

04:06.708 --> 04:09.208
You always made excuses for him!

04:09.208 --> 04:12.375
You'd never let the rest of us
get away with
half the things he did!

04:12.375 --> 04:15.583
I'm not surprised
Drake's gone bad.
He's a renegade!

04:15.583 --> 04:19.333
Renegade? No.
Free-spirited, perhaps.

04:19.333 --> 04:21.125
There you go again,
coddling him.

04:21.125 --> 04:23.708
And you are being intransigent!

04:23.708 --> 04:26.958
Listen to me! I don't know
what Bobby's up to.

04:26.958 --> 04:30.375
But I do not want him harmed.

04:30.375 --> 04:32.625
He's in enough trouble as it is.

04:39.375 --> 04:41.416
All right, split up.

04:41.416 --> 04:46.583
We grab Iceman
and we get clear without
taking on those soldiers.

04:53.750 --> 04:56.958
Whoa! This is getting
way too hot for me.

04:56.958 --> 05:00.583
BEAST: I see you have
retained your engaging
sense of humor.

05:00.583 --> 05:04.708
Beast! What's up, besides you?
Wait a minute.

05:04.708 --> 05:06.291
Xavier sent you!

05:06.291 --> 05:10.000
Professor Xavier was concerned
for your safety.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.250
I don't want his help! Or yours!

05:20.708 --> 05:23.708
OK, pal, you come easy,

05:23.708 --> 05:26.708
or I get to make cocktail ice
for a hundred.

05:28.708 --> 05:33.708
Sorry, pal, you're
skating on thin ice!

05:33.708 --> 05:34.750
So are you, Drake!

05:36.166 --> 05:37.208
(GRUNTS)

05:44.458 --> 05:47.291
A touch of overkill
there, squinty.

05:47.291 --> 05:50.125
You have no right
to wear that uniform!

05:50.125 --> 05:53.416
BEAST: It appears
we have overstayed our welcome.

05:53.416 --> 05:55.000
Something tells me

05:55.000 --> 05:58.166
this ain't your run-of-the-mill
storage depot.

05:58.166 --> 06:01.333
You do have a great facility
for the obvious.

06:01.333 --> 06:03.416
Professor Xavier,
we've got Drake.

06:03.416 --> 06:06.500
But there's a small army between
us and theBlackbird.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.208
This could get ugly.

06:08.208 --> 06:11.250
Please look after Bobby.
I'll see what I can do.

06:27.208 --> 06:29.416
Unusual tactic.

06:29.416 --> 06:32.000
Eminently preferable to
a physical confrontation.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.750
Says who?

06:33.750 --> 06:35.083
Let's move!

06:36.875 --> 06:40.500
I insist you tell me
what you were doing at
that government complex!

06:40.500 --> 06:42.291
I have nothing to say to you!

06:42.291 --> 06:44.458
We probably saved
your life last night!

06:44.458 --> 06:46.583
Nobody asked you to.

06:46.583 --> 06:50.500
What's with those two?
I've never seen
the Professor so angry.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.416
It's a surrogate
father-son dynamic,

06:53.416 --> 06:55.875
with unresolved issues
of dominance.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.875
Beast. In English?

06:57.875 --> 07:00.875
Bobby likes to
question authority.

07:00.875 --> 07:03.583
You owe the Professor
an explanation.

07:03.583 --> 07:07.000
Why? Last time I checked,
I'd flunked out of this
loony bin.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.500
You didn't flunk.
You chose to leave.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.708
I chose to think for myself,

07:12.708 --> 07:16.291
instead of always playing
the good soldier boy.

07:16.291 --> 07:18.250
(EXCLAIMS MOCKINGLY)

07:18.250 --> 07:20.458

07:20.458 --> 07:23.708
Don't push me, Drake.
I push back.

07:23.708 --> 07:25.958
Anytime, apple polisher.
I'm right here.

07:25.958 --> 07:29.458
Stop it! Both of you!

07:29.458 --> 07:32.583
Are you going back
to that compound?

07:32.583 --> 07:33.708
Maybe.

07:33.708 --> 07:34.708
I cannot condone...

07:34.708 --> 07:36.208
It's my life!

07:36.208 --> 07:38.458
I'm not one of your
students anymore.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.833
You can't tell me what to feel
and who to fight.

07:41.833 --> 07:43.458
You can't send me
to detention hall.

07:43.458 --> 07:45.583
On the contrary,

07:45.583 --> 07:48.750
until you prove that
you are no danger to
yourself or to others,

07:48.750 --> 07:50.833
that's exactly
where you're going.

07:50.833 --> 07:52.500
Hey, what is this?

07:52.500 --> 07:54.333
-That's new.
-BOBBY: Let me down.

07:54.333 --> 07:57.625
A gravity-suspension device
I recently constructed,

07:57.625 --> 08:00.416
using technology gleaned
from the Shi'ar craft

08:00.416 --> 08:02.833
found in the Morlock Tunnels.

08:02.833 --> 08:05.083
It is designed
to promote healing.

08:05.083 --> 08:07.750
I see it also serves
another function.

08:07.750 --> 08:12.000
You don't understand!
I've got to get back
to that depot!

08:12.000 --> 08:16.750
Bobby, tell us why. Trust me.

08:16.750 --> 08:19.750
Trust you? I tried that once.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.958
I can't trust any of you.

08:25.208 --> 08:28.000
Let me out of here!

Cut the volume down, will you?

Drake, Robert,
second member of X-Men.

08:48.875 --> 08:52.083
Recruited by Xavier at age 16.

08:52.083 --> 08:54.125
High potential. Low discipline.

08:55.166 --> 08:57.000
And seriously cute.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.291
Got to be careful
about pretty packages.

08:59.291 --> 09:01.708
What's inside
is usually trouble.

09:01.708 --> 09:05.583
I didn't hear you come in.
Did you know Bobby?

09:05.583 --> 09:08.208
No. Before my time.

09:08.208 --> 09:12.208
From what I hear, he's dangerous
to have around.

09:12.208 --> 09:13.458
Kind of like you.

Food for the flesh
and the spirit.

09:24.458 --> 09:26.375
My spirit and I aren't hungry.

09:26.375 --> 09:28.416
Your attack on that
federal compound

09:28.416 --> 09:30.416
suggests that you hunger
for something.

09:30.416 --> 09:33.958
Revenge perhaps? Or information.

09:33.958 --> 09:36.708
I'm sorry, Hank.
I can't tell you.

09:36.708 --> 09:38.833
By the way, where's Lorna?

09:38.833 --> 09:41.083
This has nothing
to do with Lorna!

09:41.083 --> 09:42.833
Who's Lorna?

09:42.833 --> 09:45.458
Bobby, I am your friend.

09:45.458 --> 09:48.333
I was then, I am now.

09:48.333 --> 09:51.125
Please, tell me what happened.

09:52.875 --> 09:55.875
BOBBY: I tried doing
what Xavier wanted.

09:55.875 --> 09:57.416
It was never enough
to please him.

10:03.250 --> 10:08.166
Then, after we nearly
lost Lorna, I took off.

10:12.875 --> 10:14.250
And Lorna came with me.

10:19.583 --> 10:20.708
I got a job.

10:22.625 --> 10:24.875
We lived like normal people.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.416
We weren't trying
to fight the entire world.

10:27.416 --> 10:31.500
We were young
and very much in love.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.625
And then the arguments began.
Always about our powers

10:34.625 --> 10:38.875
and our duty to
use them in the fight
for mutants' rights.

10:38.875 --> 10:41.083
Lorna sounded more
and more like Xavier.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.625
But I still loved her.

10:43.958 --> 10:45.708
One day I came by her apartment.

10:50.750 --> 10:54.625
She was gone.
The place was a wreck.

10:54.625 --> 11:00.000
My only lead was
a scrap of paper with
the name "Kirby Glen."

11:00.000 --> 11:02.250
BEAST: The location
of that storage depot!

11:02.250 --> 11:04.458
I think the government
grabbed Lorna.

11:04.458 --> 11:05.958
Bummer.

11:05.958 --> 11:09.958
Hank, get me out of here.

11:09.958 --> 11:13.708
Let go of the past.
Xavier wants to help you.

11:13.708 --> 11:16.333
But first, you must trust him.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.000
I can't.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.625
That's a pity, old friend.

11:19.625 --> 11:23.333
Without trust,
the world can be a lonely place.

11:24.375 --> 11:27.375
Yes. It can.

11:27.375 --> 11:28.375
Huh?

11:29.708 --> 11:30.833
The book!

11:33.125 --> 11:37.875
Bobby, I forgot to
give you... Oh, no.

11:42.458 --> 11:46.000
BOBBY: Perfect.
They'll never expect us
to hit them again so soon.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.625
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.500
I don't care. I'm going in.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.875
Stay put!

11:51.875 --> 11:53.333
No way!

11:53.333 --> 11:54.875
Would you keep it down?

11:54.875 --> 11:57.000
I was good enough
to help you back at the mansion,

11:57.000 --> 11:58.583
I'm good enough
to help you here.

11:58.583 --> 12:00.125
You're right.

12:00.125 --> 12:02.500
-Let's go.
-So, wait up!

12:05.750 --> 12:07.458
Nail that camera.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.875
-Let's go!
-Cool!

12:15.875 --> 12:18.875
Told you,
this is a piece of cake.

12:18.875 --> 12:20.375
And we're the crumbs!

12:23.500 --> 12:25.708
(GROANS)

12:25.708 --> 12:28.375
Excellent work.
Take them inside.

12:28.375 --> 12:30.416
When I get my hands on Drake,

12:30.416 --> 12:33.000
he's gonna be sorry
he took Jubilee.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.416
It's my fault.

12:34.416 --> 12:37.333
I should have found a way
to reach him.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.833
How do you know she didn't help
him escape?

12:39.833 --> 12:42.583
Yes. She may have overheard
my exchange with Bobby

12:42.583 --> 12:44.416
and had sympathy
for his dilemma.

12:44.416 --> 12:46.875
CYCLOPS: This is Drake's fault,
not yours.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.708
He has no respect for anyone!

12:48.708 --> 12:50.875
Give him an order,
he ignores it.

12:50.875 --> 12:54.458
Scott, losing Bobby again
has made me realize

12:54.458 --> 12:58.875
that sometimes good
leadership is knowing
when not to give orders.

12:58.875 --> 13:02.708
Don't worry. I won't say,
"I told you so."

13:11.166 --> 13:14.500
Bobby's handiwork.
We're going in, Professor.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.625
Keep this channel open.

13:16.625 --> 13:17.708
XAVIER: Good luck.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.375
FORGE: Attention,
security guards. Pull back.

13:22.375 --> 13:26.708
Do not confront the intruders.
Leave them for us!

13:30.083 --> 13:33.500
"Mutant project."
That sounds gross!

13:36.333 --> 13:39.458
You wouldn't happen to have
an aspirin the size of a bus,
would you?

13:39.458 --> 13:42.166
Sorry. Left it
in my other purse.

13:43.958 --> 13:46.875
These metal mittens
block my powers.

13:46.875 --> 13:48.625
Somebody really
did their homework.

13:48.625 --> 13:49.875
Yeah?

13:52.458 --> 13:55.083
Guess they forgot
to read the chapter about me.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.708
Let's go!

14:01.333 --> 14:04.000
Time to kiss this door goodbye!

14:07.458 --> 14:09.583
-You!
-You!

14:09.583 --> 14:12.458
Jubilee! How could you
help this misfit escape?

14:12.458 --> 14:14.375
Because he needed us!

14:14.375 --> 14:16.625
The Professor and
the rest of you guys
were too busy

14:16.625 --> 14:18.375
condemning him to notice it!

14:18.375 --> 14:19.833
That's ridiculous!

14:19.833 --> 14:22.291
No, Cyclops. Jubilee is right.

14:22.291 --> 14:26.875
I fell back into
my old role as Bobby's
disapproving headmaster.

14:26.875 --> 14:30.708
I should have found a new role,
as his friend.

14:30.708 --> 14:34.458
Hate to bust up
the therapy session,
but your hour is up!

14:39.708 --> 14:41.708
Who the heck are they?

14:41.708 --> 14:42.708
CYCLOPS: Let's move!

14:47.291 --> 14:48.625
I got one!

14:50.750 --> 14:51.875
(GRUNTS)

15:07.875 --> 15:09.500
Nice uniform, pal.

15:13.958 --> 15:16.416
I don't like your attitude.

15:20.458 --> 15:24.000
Cyclops, do you read me?
Cyclops!

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
I don't understand. What gives?

15:27.583 --> 15:30.375
I do not believe
we have been introduced.

15:31.833 --> 15:33.000
Oh, dear.

15:44.875 --> 15:47.875
Yo, tiny! Time for you to chill!

16:02.166 --> 16:05.708
Stand still, will you?
Hey! Cut that out!

16:13.708 --> 16:15.000
(JUBILEE SCREAMING)

16:16.875 --> 16:18.958
Go on. Take your best shot.

16:18.958 --> 16:20.750
It's your face, pal.

16:22.708 --> 16:25.000
What's this, a two-for-one sale?

16:26.458 --> 16:30.125
No. It's more like
a baker's dozen!

16:37.291 --> 16:39.125
(SCREAMING)

16:41.958 --> 16:44.166
I must do something to end this!

16:59.583 --> 17:02.875
X-Men, the mutants
you are fighting

17:02.875 --> 17:05.083
seem to know the limits
of your powers.

17:05.083 --> 17:09.083
Learn from Jubilee and Cyclops.
Change adversaries.

17:09.083 --> 17:11.833
Adjust your tactics to
throw them off balance!

17:14.083 --> 17:15.208
Ow!

17:15.208 --> 17:16.250
Thanks a lot.

17:20.458 --> 17:22.416
Care to trade?

17:22.416 --> 17:23.583
With pleasure.

17:31.958 --> 17:35.625
BOBBY: Well,
it looks like Xavier
had these guys figured.

17:37.583 --> 17:40.375
Yeah. Not bad
for an old man, eh?

17:42.958 --> 17:45.708
All right, where's Lorna Dane?

17:45.708 --> 17:48.000
FORGE: She's right here.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.166
Lorna!

17:52.416 --> 17:53.708
Bobby, I...

17:53.708 --> 17:55.000
(GASPS) Havok!

18:00.500 --> 18:02.416
Are you all right?

18:05.333 --> 18:08.083
Bobby, I'm sorry.

18:09.375 --> 18:11.500
FORGE: Professor Charles Xavier.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.458
I am Forge. That is Havok,

18:14.458 --> 18:18.708
Multiple Man, Strong Guy,

18:18.708 --> 18:21.458
Quicksilver, Wolfsbane.

18:21.458 --> 18:23.500
We are a mutant team
recently formed

18:23.500 --> 18:26.000
under the auspices of
the federal government.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.708
What do you mean?

18:27.708 --> 18:29.875
I work closely with
the government in this area.

18:29.875 --> 18:32.166
I have been told
of no such program!

18:32.166 --> 18:36.333
You, above all people,
can appreciate our need
for secrecy.

18:36.333 --> 18:40.083
Great. Now they're hiring
mutants to wipe out
other mutants.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.583
Not so.

18:41.583 --> 18:45.083
We want to make the world safe
for all mutants.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.958
Yourselves included.

18:46.958 --> 18:48.291
Why did you attack us?

18:48.291 --> 18:51.375
You broke into
our training camp.

18:51.375 --> 18:54.000
I must admit
we did not warn you.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.833
I thought a friendly
little skirmish with the X-Men

18:56.833 --> 18:59.500
might teach us a few pointers.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.708
I got your pointers, right here.

19:05.333 --> 19:07.083
What are you doing here?

19:07.083 --> 19:08.875
Forge recruited me in Seattle

19:08.875 --> 19:12.166
because of my experience
with the X-Men.

19:12.166 --> 19:15.000
The way you felt,
you would've tried to stop me.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.375
So we faked my own
disappearance.

19:17.375 --> 19:19.500
Why didn't you tell me later?

19:19.500 --> 19:21.375
Let me know something?

19:21.375 --> 19:25.625
I needed to start over,
without the X-Men.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.000
Without you.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.833
I would have come.
I would have...

19:29.833 --> 19:35.250
When I joined X-Factor,
I also fell in love, with Havok.

19:36.625 --> 19:40.250
Havok and I are fighting
to make things better
for mutants.

19:40.250 --> 19:43.875
I'm using my powers
to help people who need me.

19:43.875 --> 19:46.166
You've lost touch
with that, Bobby.

19:46.166 --> 19:50.333
And when you did,
I lost touch with
what I loved about you.

19:50.333 --> 19:52.291
I'm sorry.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.500
You'll get over it.

19:57.583 --> 19:59.000
Professor?

20:02.833 --> 20:03.958
Bunch of rookies.

20:03.958 --> 20:05.750
Some other time.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.083
I'm counting on it.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.291
Likewise.

20:11.458 --> 20:13.000
Don't go!

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
Yes, Bobby. Perhaps
we should all try again.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.708
Rejoin the X-Men?

20:18.708 --> 20:21.875
(LAUGHING)
Nothing's changed, Professor.

20:21.875 --> 20:24.000
By this afternoon,
I'd be driving you crazy.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.125
Come on! I like
having someone around

20:26.125 --> 20:28.333
who can get into trouble
instead of me!

20:28.333 --> 20:31.458
Hey, thanks, kid. You're OK.

20:31.458 --> 20:35.250
I'm counting on you
to keep this big shot
on his toes after I'm gone.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.208
Think we'll see him again?

20:41.458 --> 20:42.833
I can only hope.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.250
