00:13.972 --> 00:15.807
I'm Jimmy DiResta, and I'm a maker.

00:15.890 --> 00:18.643
That's a hip way of saying
I make things… like this.

00:18.727 --> 00:19.811
Pretty cool, right?

00:20.478 --> 00:21.354
Walk with me.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.858
For years, I made my name
as a toy designer in New York City.

00:24.941 --> 00:28.653
Then I realized I don't like the city,
I don't like designing toys,

00:28.737 --> 00:31.406
and to be honest with you,
I don't really like kids.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.033
It's not like I hate them or anything.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.744
It's just it's,
"Check out my little Timmy."

00:35.827 --> 00:36.745
I don't care.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.246
Look at my birds.

00:40.081 --> 00:41.833
So anyway, I quit my job,

00:41.916 --> 00:45.503
I left the city,
and I moved upstate to here, my farm.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.922
I got land, I got animals,

00:48.590 --> 00:51.009
and best of all, I have this.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.094
The ultimate maker workshop!

00:53.720 --> 00:58.141
Inside, I have every kind of tool
and machine imaginable to make things.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.977
Pretty impressive stuff, huh?

01:02.145 --> 01:05.523
Really? You're labeling the table
like that's some sort of impress--

01:05.607 --> 01:07.108
"Bag"? We can just--

01:07.192 --> 01:09.652
Okay. Graphics guy trying to be funny.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.030
Can we please get on with it? Anyway…

01:12.113 --> 01:15.075
So I got a call to be on a TV show
because I'm a maker celebrity or whatever.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.410
I said, "Sure, cool." Why not, right?

01:17.494 --> 01:18.536
So I agreed.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.206
Then I found out who I'd be working for.

01:21.289 --> 01:22.207
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:22.290 --> 01:23.625
<i>-Hi.</i>
<i>-Hi!</i>

01:23.708 --> 01:24.626
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:24.709 --> 01:25.543
<i>Hey, Jimmy.</i>

01:25.627 --> 01:26.753
What do you want?

01:26.836 --> 01:28.630
<i>Okay, Mr. Grouch.</i>

01:29.839 --> 01:34.302
Thirty years of expert build experience,
and I'm taking orders from half-pints.

01:34.385 --> 01:37.806
Because misery loves company,
I brought my buddies in on it with me.

01:37.889 --> 01:38.723
Say hi, guys.

01:38.807 --> 01:39.641
-Howdy!
-Hello!

01:39.724 --> 01:42.811
That's Jackman.
He's an engineer, and he plans everything.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.729
It's really annoying, but he's good at it.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.397
That's Derek, my best friend.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.692
Big guy and even bigger softie.

01:50.443 --> 01:51.653
This is Graz.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.905
Good maker, bad jokes.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.031
And Canadian Pat.

01:56.032 --> 01:58.618
Well, your guess is as good as mine.

01:58.701 --> 01:59.702
Let's have some fun.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.750
Together, we'll take pitches on this.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.419
Listen to whatever
their dumb little brains come up with.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.672
<i>The Pig Tripper. It trips the pig.</i>

02:10.755 --> 02:13.424
-Wow.
So a catapult that throws cat poop?

02:13.508 --> 02:15.301
<i>-Yes.</i>

02:15.385 --> 02:18.471
If it's interesting or doable,
I'll build it. If not--

02:18.555 --> 02:19.514
Next!

02:19.597 --> 02:20.765
-Next!
<i>-No way.</i>

02:20.849 --> 02:22.392
-Next!
<i>-Shut up!</i>

02:22.475 --> 02:24.185
-Some builds will be good.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.104
Dino Taco Toilet.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.689
Are you not entertained?

02:27.772 --> 02:29.357
Some builds will be bad.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.693
Graz, I told you
the scissors were gonna be too heavy!

02:31.776 --> 02:32.819
Make a bigger handle!

02:32.902 --> 02:34.988
But all of them
will be absolutely pointless.

02:35.071 --> 02:37.157
-Yeah!
<i>-That is disgusting.</i>

02:38.408 --> 02:40.076
Whoa!

02:40.660 --> 02:43.872
<i>-I want the unicorn to fart!</i>
-I can't believe I'm doing this.

02:43.955 --> 02:46.040
-Go, Graz!

02:46.124 --> 02:49.127
Why are we doing this?
Because we make things. That's what we do.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.172
-Thought we weren't supposed to have fun.
-I'm not having fun!

02:52.964 --> 02:54.966
We're gonna show these kids,
if they can dream it up…

02:55.049 --> 02:58.052
<i>I want it to be a guitar boat that floats.</i>

02:58.136 --> 02:59.262
You're onto something there.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.930
…it can be built.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.266
<i>Oh!</i>

03:03.349 --> 03:04.934
<i>That is so cool!</i>

03:05.018 --> 03:07.020
Hey. It might even
inspire them to build

03:07.103 --> 03:09.189
outside their little <i>Minecraft</i> -y world,
or whatever.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.065
-Do I wanna do it?

03:11.149 --> 03:12.650
Dumbest thing we've ever made.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.820
Not really.
But this isn't about me, is it?

03:15.904 --> 03:18.031
-So here we are.
<i>-You better get to work.</i>

03:18.114 --> 03:20.200
Funny how their dreams are my nightmare.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.369
Come on, Jimmy. Have some fun.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.287
Whatever.

03:37.425 --> 03:38.801
I've never had a job.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.596
I've only worked for myself,
since I was in middle school.

03:41.679 --> 03:43.848
Really? Not even like
a paperboy or anything?

03:44.849 --> 03:46.351
-I was a paperboy.
-Yeah.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.518
-Sorry.
-I was too.

03:47.602 --> 03:50.355
I was a paperboy
that instead of delivering papers,

03:50.438 --> 03:53.107
I sat in front of a coffee shop.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.152
-And people came to me to buy papers.
-You were a newsie?

03:56.236 --> 03:59.614
Yeah. I was like, "Extra! Extra!
Lindbergh crosses the Atlantic."

03:59.697 --> 04:01.241
-Did you really do that?
-No.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.243
-We have kids calling in.

04:03.326 --> 04:06.579
So let's get into
the kids-calling-in position.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.831
-You guys ready?
-Ready.

04:08.915 --> 04:10.291
Let's see our first client.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.586
Hey, guys. What are your names?

04:13.670 --> 04:15.129
<i>My name's Kenzie and…</i>

04:15.213 --> 04:16.381
<i>My name is Kincaid.</i>

04:16.965 --> 04:18.508
-Oh! Oh no.
-Oh no.

04:18.591 --> 04:19.759
-Oh, jeez.
-Trouble.

04:19.842 --> 04:22.303
<i>-Hi!</i>
-Hi. What's your name?

04:22.387 --> 04:23.471
<i>Juliette.</i>

04:23.554 --> 04:25.265
<i>Hi. I'm Eric.</i>

04:25.348 --> 04:27.767
Eric, nice to meet you, buddy.
Where do you live?

04:27.850 --> 04:29.185
<i>I live in Pittsburgh.</i>

04:29.269 --> 04:32.272
-Sorry to hear that.

04:32.355 --> 04:34.023
Do you have an invention for us?

04:34.107 --> 04:36.109
<i>It's a smell-transfer machine.</i>

04:36.192 --> 04:38.319
<i>-There's a sniffer right here.</i>
-Okay.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.154
-<i>And it suctions up the smell.</i>
-Oh God.

04:40.238 --> 04:43.157
So the machine smells the smell
and then what does it do with it?

04:43.241 --> 04:46.577
<i>Then it takes some sort of oil</i>
<i>or extract that has scent in it,</i>

04:46.661 --> 04:47.996
<i>and it takes them and--</i>

04:48.079 --> 04:50.415
This is way beyond our paygrade.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.874
Got any dumber ideas?

04:51.958 --> 04:54.294
<i>-I do have a simpler idea.</i>

04:55.003 --> 04:56.796
-Perfect.
-What is your pitch?

04:56.879 --> 04:59.590
<i>You put a bowl on a conveyor belt,</i>

04:59.674 --> 05:03.511
<i>and there's different toppings,</i>
<i>and if you push buttons--</i>

05:03.594 --> 05:05.805
It's like
an ice-cream-sundae-making machine?

05:05.888 --> 05:06.973
<i>Yeah. I guess.</i>

05:07.056 --> 05:08.725
Just what all of us fatsos need.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.810
-I'll take two.
I'll take two as well.

05:10.893 --> 05:16.232
<i>I'm a kid that loves football,</i>
<i>and I usually play with my dad,</i>

05:16.316 --> 05:18.776
<i>but he… he gets tired all the time,</i>

05:18.860 --> 05:22.613
<i>so I want a robot</i>
<i>that can play football with me.</i>

05:22.697 --> 05:25.700
You want a robot
that he can play football with?

05:25.783 --> 05:28.911
-Do you guys know how to build a robot?
-Mm-mm.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.581
-Do you guys know how to play football?
-No.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.208
We might have to push this guy
onto somebody else.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.878
<i>My second idea is a table, basically.</i>

05:36.961 --> 05:38.004
We can make a table.

05:38.087 --> 05:40.840
<i>There's also a pullout mirror. </i>

05:41.424 --> 05:43.760
-Is that a makeup desk?
-<i>I like mirrors.</i>

05:43.843 --> 05:45.762
<i>And then you have a whiteboard.</i>

05:45.845 --> 05:49.682
Can you wipe off the whiteboard?
<i>-Well, duh, that's why it's a whiteboard.</i>

05:49.766 --> 05:51.934
-You know what else you can wipe?

05:52.018 --> 05:53.978
We could wipe the screen clean. Watch.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.188
Next!

05:57.065 --> 05:59.108
-Eric, do you know Elon Musk?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

05:59.192 --> 06:01.569
Reach out to Elon Musk,
he'll make you a whole team of robots.

06:01.652 --> 06:02.904
<i>Ooh.</i>

06:02.987 --> 06:05.698
Okay? All we have here is wood and idiots.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.158
And we're out of wood.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.868
-Next!

06:09.827 --> 06:12.747
Juliette, these four fatsos
will jump all over this.

06:12.830 --> 06:16.376
-I want some ice cream.
-But I am trying to lose a bit of weight.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.212
<i>-Uh-huh.</i>
-You're so cute, adorable, and talented.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.589
Will you allow me
to say it's okay to pass on you?

06:21.672 --> 06:22.632
<i>Of course.</i>

06:22.715 --> 06:24.842
-Aw!
-What a nice kid.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.052
<i>-Thank you.</i>
-Bye.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.012
Normally this is so easy.

06:28.096 --> 06:31.391
Like brothers farting into cups and stuff.
I mean, that makes it easy to say no.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.934
We can get ice cream later.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.478
-Hey. What's up, guys?
-Hey-oh!

06:35.561 --> 06:36.854
What's your name?

06:36.938 --> 06:38.731
<i>-I'm Theman.</i>
<i>-And I'm Jean.</i>

06:38.815 --> 06:40.400
Do you guys like to make things?

06:40.483 --> 06:42.527
<i>-Yes. We like crafting things.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

06:42.610 --> 06:46.280
<i>One time we made a little house</i>
<i>for her Christmas elf.</i>

06:46.364 --> 06:48.866
Right on. We have a Christmas elf.
He's right here.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.202
-Yeah.
-We call him the elf on the table.

06:51.828 --> 06:55.164
We were gonna put him on the shelf,
but it was too high. He got nervous.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.333
That's very funny.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.252
What do you have to pitch metoday?

06:59.335 --> 07:02.213
<i>Well, we have this big problem</i>
<i>about cats and--</i>

07:02.296 --> 07:05.883
<i>We have tons of cats.</i>
<i>I have seven. She has two.</i>

07:05.967 --> 07:07.176
<i>They poop all in the yard.</i>

07:07.260 --> 07:11.848
<i>-So we want a machine that can fling it.</i>
<i>-Robot arm.</i>

07:11.931 --> 07:14.934
-Are we flinging the cats?
Throwing the cats or the poop?

07:15.017 --> 07:16.018
That's dark.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.603
<i>-Poop.</i>
<i>-Poop. The cat poop.</i>

07:17.687 --> 07:19.147
Throwing the cat <i>poop.</i>

07:19.230 --> 07:22.275
-That's fine.
<i>-It picks it up, and it throws it… Whoo!</i>

07:22.358 --> 07:23.401
<i>It yeets it.</i>

07:23.484 --> 07:25.695
-It yeets it?

07:25.778 --> 07:27.155
I'll put it to you straight.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.740
You guys wanna see something
that throws cat poop?

07:29.824 --> 07:30.700
<i>Yes.</i>

07:30.783 --> 07:33.953
That's one of the crappiest ideas
we've heard all day, but we're interested.

07:34.036 --> 07:35.746
Flinging crap as far as we can.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.082
-That's our wheelhouse.
-That's fun.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.376
You guys know what a catapult is?

07:40.918 --> 07:42.253
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-Yes. Yeah.</i>

07:42.336 --> 07:43.671
This could be a catapoop.

07:43.754 --> 07:45.756
What about a trebuchet?
Could we do a trebuchet?

07:45.840 --> 07:47.383
You're from Canada now too?

07:47.467 --> 07:51.471
-Trebuchet. It's a type of catapult.
-Learn that at your local Ren fair?

07:51.554 --> 07:54.098
No. I've never been to a Ren fair.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.767
Why are you making things complicated?

07:56.851 --> 07:58.853
It's the superior siege weapon.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.855
Do you know what a trebuchet is?

08:00.938 --> 08:02.273
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-Nope.</i>

08:02.356 --> 08:04.108
-That makes eight of us.

08:04.692 --> 08:08.321
All right, all right.
So trebpoopchet or a catapoop?

08:08.988 --> 08:12.492
-Which one do you want us to make?
<i>-I like both. I just like the name--</i>

08:12.575 --> 08:13.743
<i>Hey! I got an idea.</i>

08:13.826 --> 08:15.536
-Oh boy.
<i>-Make both of them.</i>

08:15.620 --> 08:16.829
Both?

08:16.913 --> 08:19.165
<i>Both. And we'll figure out</i>
<i>which one's better.</i>

08:20.958 --> 08:23.211
Catapoop or trebpoochet?

08:23.294 --> 08:24.212
All right.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.006
Throw down. Literally.

08:27.089 --> 08:28.090
Me versus you?

08:28.674 --> 08:30.676
-Who can throw the furthest.
-Okay.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.221
Hey, Pat. Meow we have a competition.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.892
All right, guys, you're getting your way.
We're gonna make two.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.686
Trebpoochet versus catapoop.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.271
<i>-Yes! I love that idea!</i>
<i>-Finally!</i>

08:42.355 --> 08:44.232
We're gonna get to work. Thank you.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.610
All right. Trebuchet versus catapult.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.779
-You think you're gonna beat me?
-Of course.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.322
<i>Ooh!</i>

08:51.405 --> 08:53.241
All right, let's figure this out. Come on.

09:03.626 --> 09:06.337
-What are the teams?
I'd love to work with you, Jimmy.

09:06.420 --> 09:09.757
-So, Derek, me and you and Pat?
-Graz. Works for me.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.926
-Versus the young guys.
-Team Youth.

09:12.009 --> 09:15.137
-Ha, you guys are gonna die sooner.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.599
I'm gonna design a catapult,
and you guys design your piece of junk.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.101
I have a plan already.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.479
-Okay. Go.
-Angry old men.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.898
-You guys draw on a piece of paper.
-Have fun.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.110
For the catapoop,
I have a pretty interesting idea.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.404
It's gonna have
like a cup on it, like this.

09:31.487 --> 09:35.658
And that will be the thing that has the
litter box with the cat turd ammo in it.

09:35.741 --> 09:36.951
How does it work, you ask?

09:37.034 --> 09:40.079
In the old days, they would take rope,
bundles of rope,

09:40.162 --> 09:43.124
and wrap it around
the outside of the frame of the catapult.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.584
And then they'd put an arm,

09:44.667 --> 09:47.086
usually a big log or timber
or something like that.

09:47.169 --> 09:50.089
They'd stick the wood in the rope,
and then they'd twist it back.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.340
Twist it. Yeah.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.551
Twisting the rope creates tension,

09:53.634 --> 09:56.262
and because the rope
naturally wants to untwist,

09:56.345 --> 09:59.056
it propels the arm forward as it does so.

09:59.140 --> 10:02.143
But how do you make sure that
whatever's at the end flings into the air

10:02.226 --> 10:03.686
and not directly at the ground?

10:03.769 --> 10:06.188
By putting a crossbeam
or a brace at the top

10:06.272 --> 10:08.524
that will stop
the range of motion of the arm.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.192
Once it hits the brace,

10:10.276 --> 10:13.946
that's where it stops short
and throws the cat poop.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.031
All right.

10:15.114 --> 10:18.075
So using the rope's tension
and stopping the momentum of the arm

10:18.159 --> 10:20.911
is what we will use
to make the cat dung fly.

10:20.995 --> 10:23.623
And then it would shoot like that.
Any input?

10:24.123 --> 10:26.500
No. I love it. I think the idea
with the rope is great.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.629
-Make it look medieval to intimidate them.
-Yeah.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.966
-Trebuchet.
-Trebpoochet.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.259
Trebpoochet.

10:35.343 --> 10:39.180
A trebuchet is basically
a big triangle with a pivot point.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.390
Why a triangle shape?

10:41.474 --> 10:44.977
'Cause not only is a triangle
the sturdiest, strongest geometric shape

10:45.061 --> 10:46.896
when it comes to distribution of weight,

10:46.979 --> 10:50.483
but for a trebuchet it has a flat,
strong base for the bottom,

10:50.566 --> 10:53.778
and a fulcrum pivot point at the top,
which everything will hinge from.

10:53.861 --> 10:54.945
Okay.

10:55.029 --> 10:57.031
-So that's the throwing arm.
-Okay.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.075
There's one short side
and one longer side.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.994
On the long side, there's
a sling attached that holds the poop.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.622
On the shorter side,
we'll attach a counterweight.

11:04.705 --> 11:08.125
And as that counterweight drops,
gravity pulls the weight down,

11:08.209 --> 11:11.545
whipping the long side of the arm
with the sling under and around,

11:11.629 --> 11:14.423
and at that point, cat poo goes a-flyin'.

11:14.507 --> 11:15.633
Cool. I get it now.

11:15.716 --> 11:20.096
That's just a basic geometry of it.
Don't know what we'll make this out of.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.807
I mean, if they go wood,
we should probably go steel.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.184
-Super strong?
-Make it super strong.

11:25.267 --> 11:28.020
Not only should we win,
we should completely crush them.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.021
Yeah.

11:38.698 --> 11:39.699
Let's play.

11:58.050 --> 12:00.469
-Trebuchet time.
-We're building a trebuchet.

12:00.553 --> 12:04.390
You're gonna pull "a Jimmy" and make
a little model and show me how it works?

12:04.473 --> 12:05.433
I'm gonna play Jimmy.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.727
You're gonna be grumpy,
be like, "Check out this model."

12:07.810 --> 12:08.978
"Kids… Ugh."

12:09.478 --> 12:11.313
-It's a very simple machine.
-Very.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.149
But it's really important
our math checks out.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.234
That means we're gonna
take our time and do it right.

12:15.317 --> 12:17.069
Doesn't matter. I just want to win.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.029
-I live to defeat Jimmy.
-Yeah.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.698
All I want is his acceptance.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.491
The only way I get that
is by defeating him.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.868
Jackman's right.

12:23.951 --> 12:27.413
Obviously, model-making is
a very important part of my process.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.749
Since we'll be dealing
with a lot of moving parts,

12:29.832 --> 12:32.042
quickly whipping up a small-scale catapult

12:32.126 --> 12:35.713
will expose any potential problems
with the design early on. And guess what?

12:35.796 --> 12:37.006
It's gonna work.

12:37.089 --> 12:39.592
Those idiots are still trying
to figure out math.

12:40.384 --> 12:42.636
That should be the pivot point there.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.890
That should be the pivot point
where our weight wants to sit.

12:45.973 --> 12:48.350
Because this is my design
there aren't any problems,

12:48.434 --> 12:50.519
so we're already ahead of the game.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.147
Hey, Jackman, how's it coming?
You doing good?

12:53.230 --> 12:54.732
-Yeah.
-Yeah, good.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.986
These nerds can take as long they want.
We're gonna start actually building.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.614
Oh.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.366
Okay. Now we're actually
gonna start building.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.576
We know who's gonna win.

13:11.165 --> 13:15.085
Before we start flinging cat poo,
we need to build a sturdy foundation.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.837
I think we're gonna go to here.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.672
That'll give us enough inside the frame.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.508
Let me draw the line on,
then you can cut it.

13:20.591 --> 13:24.845
We're taking a bunch of 4x4s
and cutting them to create our base frame,

13:24.929 --> 13:26.514
just like the chassis of a car.

13:29.058 --> 13:32.853
Then we'll notch out grooves
so we have a place to lay in our axles.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.698
We're putting Canadian Pat's
expertise on the lathe to good use.

13:45.783 --> 13:48.953
Let's get medieval on this thing. Yeah!

13:56.377 --> 13:58.170
He's shaving down a couple of 4x4s

13:58.254 --> 14:00.422
and using the roughing gouge
to round out the ends,

14:00.506 --> 14:02.508
where we're going to attach the wheels.

14:04.927 --> 14:07.304
We'll bolt in our wooden axles
to the side beams…

14:07.388 --> 14:08.222
There you go.

14:08.305 --> 14:09.306
…and now…

14:12.518 --> 14:15.187
…we have a manly,
medieval, wooden catapult frame.

14:18.148 --> 14:21.443
While what those guys have
over there is a triangle.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.154
Okay, Graz. I think
we're ready to start the real trebuchet.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.448
That'll start with making
the frame of the sides.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.742
So just a bunch of tube steel,
cutting and welding.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.619
-Let's do it.
-Let's get started.

14:34.123 --> 14:38.002
Like I said, a trebuchet catapult frame
is made of two metal triangles.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.628
<i>Try angles.</i>

14:39.712 --> 14:41.755
<i>Support the weight with angles.</i>

14:41.839 --> 14:44.008
<i>Try triangles.</i>

14:44.091 --> 14:48.262
So we'll be cutting metal
tube stock into six ten-foot sections.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.055
Oil me, Jackman.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.974
<i>Triangles.</i>

14:52.057 --> 14:54.101
<i>Cut the ends at angles.</i>

14:54.184 --> 14:56.437
We'll need this thing
to absorb a ton of force.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.481
Luckily, there's one shape
structurally designed just to do that.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.234
-<i>Triangle.</i>

15:04.278 --> 15:05.738
<i>Triangle.</i>

15:05.821 --> 15:07.698
<i>What's your angle?</i>

15:08.407 --> 15:10.910
We're gonna use a MIG welder
to combine the three sides

15:10.993 --> 15:12.453
of the triangle sections.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.704
Then see what we got.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.206
<i>Triangles.</i>

15:16.290 --> 15:17.708
<i>Only one right angle.</i>

15:19.585 --> 15:21.378
Here comes the square.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.927
And lastly, we'll make the necessary
measurements to properly align the base.

15:28.969 --> 15:29.887
Oh. Oh.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.388
Then weld it all together.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.390
<i>Triangles.</i>

15:33.474 --> 15:35.643
<i>Our plan wasn't mangled.</i>

15:35.726 --> 15:36.602
Bam.

15:36.685 --> 15:39.897
-That looks great.
-I love how simple of a machine this is.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.857
It's beautiful in its simplicity.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.567
That's how people describe me.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.827
Jimmy, how big
you thinking for the wheels?

15:53.911 --> 15:55.496
So maybe, uh, like, 27, 28.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.915
-Yeah. I'll do 28 just for easy numbers.
-Okay.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.834
Our medieval weapon
needs medieval wheels.

16:03.545 --> 16:06.590
So I'm cutting down 4x8 pieces of pine

16:06.674 --> 16:08.842
and stacking two layers
on top of each other

16:08.926 --> 16:10.636
in a crisscross fashion.

16:10.719 --> 16:12.471
This will make the wheels strong enough

16:12.554 --> 16:15.975
to support the heavy weight
of the catapult as it rolls.

16:18.394 --> 16:21.230
Once I screw the boards together
into a solid square,

16:21.313 --> 16:24.942
I'll trace a perfect circle on top of it,
using a compass,

16:25.025 --> 16:27.861
then bring it over to the bandsaw
to create the smooth rounded edge.

16:31.657 --> 16:36.120
I gotta say, the cavemen really knocked it
out of the park with the wheel design.

16:36.203 --> 16:39.456
Not bad for a bunch of hairy,
primitive Neanderthals.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.876
Thankfully, mankind
has come a long way since those days.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.676
This is awesome.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.595
What we need to do next is to get the rope

16:53.679 --> 16:55.556
and we'll start testing
the tension of the rope.

16:55.639 --> 16:58.434
We'll get one of those 4x4s
that's gonna be our throwing arm,

16:58.517 --> 17:00.728
and we'll start seeing
what we're looking at.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.399
Okay. So let's wrap that
around here a few times

17:05.482 --> 17:07.818
and start getting a vibe
for how this rope is gonna work.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.737
Here's a quick history lesson.

17:09.820 --> 17:12.322
In the Middle Ages,
they used this twisted rope,

17:12.406 --> 17:16.326
also called a torsion bundle,
to act as a spring for the catapult.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.911
Let's see what that does.

17:17.995 --> 17:21.582
But even though the catapult
is mostly known as a medieval weapon,

17:21.665 --> 17:26.295
this method dates way, way back
to 350 BCE, whatever the hell that means.

17:26.962 --> 17:30.257
Okay, get 'em to where you want to go.
Let's tie that off on this side.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.885
Yeah. So, like cavemen catapults.

17:32.968 --> 17:35.179
If Netflix didn't tell me
to read this fact,

17:35.262 --> 17:36.930
I wouldn't have known it either.

17:37.806 --> 17:40.768
Now, we're gonna test
and see what we need.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.399
We definitely need more tension.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.319
-That's why we have the wedge.
-Yeah. The wedge is gonna help it.

17:50.402 --> 17:53.238
Since the rope is made up
of fabric that can become stretched out,

17:53.322 --> 17:55.032
we have to make sure to keep it taut.

17:55.115 --> 17:58.410
To do that, we put a wedge
between the rope and the side beam.

17:58.494 --> 18:02.039
The more the wedge goes in,
the tighter the rope's gonna get.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.416
Definitely more tight.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.503
I'm afraid to let this go.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.838
I'm afraid it'll shoot through the window.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.673
-Try it.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.050
Damn. Humans are evil.

18:13.133 --> 18:16.345
Derek, could you imagine
I hated somebody so much,

18:16.428 --> 18:18.847
all the way over there, I needed
to throw something at them?

18:18.931 --> 18:22.851
-Now you just do it on the Internet.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.940
-Have you seen what they're doing?
-Yeah.

18:28.023 --> 18:31.110
They're kind of, uh,
a little more ahead of us.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.195
The competition isn't who gets done first.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.906
It's to throw cat poop the furthest.

18:35.989 --> 18:38.367
-Exactly.
-I just wanna beat them really badly.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.160
-Stick with me.
-All right.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.871
Eventually this trebuchet's
gonna generate a ton of force,

18:42.955 --> 18:46.416
so we need to reinforce these joints
with thick metal plates known as gussets.

18:47.793 --> 18:51.130
To fabricate them, we're gonna use
an industrial plasma cutter.

18:51.713 --> 18:54.633
I made some designs
and programed them into the computer.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.387
They're just these triangles here.
This one has holes in it.

18:58.470 --> 19:01.890
Our pivot point for the arm
is gonna run through that big hole there.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.309
Let's cut some gussets.

19:04.393 --> 19:07.771
<i> One, two, three, do it.</i>

19:23.203 --> 19:24.204
<i>Do it.</i>

19:29.168 --> 19:31.295
I have to hold back my tears right now.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.505
I programed the plasma cutter
to make more gussets

19:33.589 --> 19:35.340
that we'll weld to the corners
of the frame,

19:35.424 --> 19:37.509
so it doesn't collapse
from the force of the weight.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.138
Look at this stack of dimes right here.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.931
With our gussets in place,

19:43.015 --> 19:45.142
we're gonna start
fabricating the throwing arm.

19:45.934 --> 19:49.855
The throwing arm will obviously be
at the top of our triangle on a pivot bar.

19:49.938 --> 19:53.942
Just imagine Graz here,
just less a bearded man or bearded kid…

19:54.026 --> 19:54.860
This is kinda nice.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.987
…and more like a steel beam.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.780
Ready? I'm gonna whip you around.

19:58.864 --> 19:59.698
Oh God.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.784
Jimmy's been making fun
of us for being slow,

20:02.868 --> 20:06.038
but with a build like this,
it's all about getting the math right.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.585
And because I took my time…

20:12.544 --> 20:14.046
Oh, this is heavy already.

20:14.129 --> 20:17.591
…I know this arm is gonna swing
oh so smooth and extra swangy.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.187
Now that
we've got the arm in place,

20:30.270 --> 20:32.231
you can really see
the advantages of a trebuchet.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.440
Once we add weights,

20:33.523 --> 20:37.152
our trebuchet arm will have
a nearly 360 degree range of motion

20:37.236 --> 20:38.528
to build up launch speed.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.988
Compare that to the catapult,

20:40.072 --> 20:42.616
which is limited to
about a 90 degree range of motion.

20:42.699 --> 20:44.993
So like I've been saying,
the math checks out,

20:45.077 --> 20:47.454
making the trebuchet
the superior siege weapon.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.164
This thing's gonna whip.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.970
What we're doing now
is putting the big stopper in place,

21:03.053 --> 21:06.223
so that the throwing arm
has something to stop against.

21:06.306 --> 21:08.642
And that also is what causes it to launch.

21:08.725 --> 21:11.228
They say that teamwork makes dream work.

21:11.311 --> 21:13.313
I don't know
if that's all true across the board,

21:13.397 --> 21:16.191
but I do know that whatever
my team's got going on over here,

21:16.275 --> 21:18.944
rivals the stuff
that Hollywood makes TV shows about.

21:24.241 --> 21:27.327
Thirty-two and three-quarters.
That's close enough.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.129
Top secret.
They're top-secret improvements.

21:40.382 --> 21:41.758
I farted in my coverall.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.306
How glad are you
that you're not on their team?

21:47.431 --> 21:49.808
I'm standing around watching them do math.

21:53.895 --> 21:56.648
Whoa, whoa, whoa, editor.
What's going on here?

21:56.732 --> 21:59.318
This is getting absurd.
Can we please get back to the build?

22:02.070 --> 22:04.489
It's… It's gonna be so good.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.664
Oh, hey. I didn't see you there. I…

22:15.625 --> 22:19.129
We're here at the CNC table,
and now we're gonna make some wheels.

22:19.212 --> 22:22.007
And I am wheelie excited
to tell you about that.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.968
<i>Pun fun! </i>

22:25.469 --> 22:27.929
We're gonna be cutting out circles,
stack them together,

22:28.013 --> 22:29.765
and we're gonna have
three-inch thick wheels.

22:29.848 --> 22:33.518
And because the trebuchet
isn't that exciting-looking,

22:33.602 --> 22:35.896
we put some paws on the outside.

22:35.979 --> 22:37.689
That's pretty cool. Isn't it?

22:37.773 --> 22:41.610
It's simple. I'm gonna load the program,
hit start, and it's gonna start cutting.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.694
Let's get going.

22:55.582 --> 22:57.167
Now all we need is a little glue,

22:57.709 --> 23:00.545
some staples, some ball bearings,

23:01.755 --> 23:03.090
and booyah.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.341
I got the wheels.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.385
-Look at those.
-Check it out.

23:06.468 --> 23:09.012
They came out purr-fect.

23:10.972 --> 23:12.599
<i>Pun fun! </i>

23:13.433 --> 23:16.478
-Huge. Look at the cat paws.
-We're rolling on 23s right now.

23:16.561 --> 23:18.522
This was the upgrade
at the dealership.

23:18.605 --> 23:19.940
Exactly.

23:24.027 --> 23:24.861
Wow.

23:25.529 --> 23:27.614
It works wheelie well.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.741
<i> Pun fun! </i>

23:51.721 --> 23:54.057
<i>Attention, Jimmy.</i>
<i>Children calling.</i>

23:54.641 --> 23:55.809
<i>Attention, Jimmy.</i>

23:55.892 --> 23:57.727
<i>Time to talk to the kids again.</i>

23:59.146 --> 24:01.606
Hello, Jean and Theman. How are you guys?

24:01.690 --> 24:03.275
-What's up, guys?
-<i> Good.</i>

24:03.358 --> 24:05.318
<i>-How's the project going?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

24:05.402 --> 24:07.571
-Depends on the team you ask.

24:07.654 --> 24:08.655
<i>Who's on which team?</i>

24:08.738 --> 24:12.033
It's me and Derek and Pat.
We're doing the catapoop.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.327
-And these guys are doing the…
-Trebpoochet.

24:14.411 --> 24:16.621
And we're going pretty fast, pretty good.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.874
The other team, they're going.

24:18.957 --> 24:22.836
<i>Have you ever heard this phrase?</i>
<i>"Slow and steady wins the race."</i>

24:23.920 --> 24:27.674
Hey, Theman. If you were born
with a plan, you just work quick.

24:29.926 --> 24:31.970
<i>That is so squeaky.</i>

24:32.053 --> 24:33.054
<i>I know.</i>

24:33.138 --> 24:34.890
Let's show them how it's done.

24:34.973 --> 24:37.100
-Do you hear how loud that is?
It's so loud.

24:37.184 --> 24:42.189
<i>The things look really cool,</i>
<i>but I think they need more designs and…</i>

24:42.272 --> 24:45.025
<i>-Cat pizzazz.</i>
<i>-Cat pizzazz.</i>

24:45.108 --> 24:47.611
-More pizzazz, huh?
<i>-More pizzazz.</i>

24:47.694 --> 24:48.778
<i>Pizzazz.</i>

24:48.862 --> 24:50.655
<i>Uh-oh. Scratch that.</i>

24:50.739 --> 24:51.573
<i>Meow!</i>

24:51.656 --> 24:54.576
<i>Jimmy's getting razzed</i>
<i>with pizzazz.</i>

24:55.660 --> 24:57.496
Okay. Give me some ideas.

24:57.579 --> 25:02.959
<i>Put like a cat face with like a cat head</i>
<i>and like cat paws, and like, uh--</i>

25:03.043 --> 25:06.421
Can we just tack a real cat
in there and call it done?

25:08.757 --> 25:11.009
<i>Just do something. I don't care.</i>

25:11.092 --> 25:12.135
I got it, you little turds.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.595
<i>You're the bigger turd.</i>

25:13.678 --> 25:16.932
-Oh!

25:17.015 --> 25:19.434
-See what she did there?
-Oh no, you didn't.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.979
All right. Cat stuff. We got it.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.898
-We can do that.
-We got it from here.

25:24.981 --> 25:26.525
It was a pleasure talking to you.

25:26.608 --> 25:27.692
<i>-Okay.</i>
-See you later.

25:27.776 --> 25:28.610
<i>You too.</i>

25:29.236 --> 25:31.863
So you heard them, guys.
They want cat pizzazz.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.699
I'm guessing this is gonna be the tail.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.201
-Definitely the tail.
-Okay.

25:36.284 --> 25:38.578
We do the image of the cat
right here in the front.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.789
We need to catify this thing.
So what are you thinking?

25:40.872 --> 25:44.668
The best idea that popped into my head
was doing like a cat silhouette

25:44.751 --> 25:47.420
like within the triangle,
and towards the front.

25:47.504 --> 25:50.215
-Yeah.
-You know when the cat stretches out?

25:50.298 --> 25:51.758
-Butt in the air?
-Yeah.

25:51.841 --> 25:53.510
Yeah. Something like that.

25:55.345 --> 25:56.388
Yeah. I like it.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.557
We cut the silhouette from plywood
on the CNC.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.975
I like it.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.101
Let's get started.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.358
We have a plan here.

26:08.441 --> 26:11.820
We're gonna take this fabric,
wrap it around some plywood,

26:11.903 --> 26:15.448
create the illusion of this cat
standing at the front of the catapult.

26:15.532 --> 26:18.076
Pat, you had ideas
on the eyes and the expression.

26:18.159 --> 26:21.371
Yeah, for the eyes I was thinking
maybe take a round mold

26:21.454 --> 26:23.999
and pour resin in it, like black resin.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.209
Yeah. So it's nice and shiny and stuff?

26:26.293 --> 26:28.712
-Yeah.
-Yeah. What expression should she have?

26:28.795 --> 26:31.381
I don't know.
A cat, when he's mad, is like…

26:32.841 --> 26:36.219
-Yeah.
-And when he's super happy, he's like…

26:38.013 --> 26:39.723
-Yeah.
-How about when he's playful?

26:41.558 --> 26:43.560
-Can I see happy again?
-Yeah.

26:45.061 --> 26:48.440
-Yeah. I think that's the best way.
-And we need the nose.

26:48.523 --> 26:50.650
-Yeah?
-Yeah. So we can boop it.

26:50.734 --> 26:53.570
Like, you know, boop.

26:54.904 --> 26:57.115
-What the hell was that?

26:57.616 --> 26:59.284
You know, the boop.

26:59.367 --> 27:02.537
Dude, don't do that.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.582
-That's just weird.
-All right, guys.

27:05.665 --> 27:08.376
-Here's the game plan. We need to give--
-Boop.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.421
You wanna try?

27:11.504 --> 27:14.841
-Okay. Yeah. Boop. Okay. Yeah. Cute.
-Yeah. It's fun, right?

27:14.924 --> 27:17.802
-It is fun.
-All right. Let's get some plywood.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.679
Together we'll cut it out, wrap it.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.931
Pat, work on the eyes, nose, and whiskers.

27:22.015 --> 27:23.475
-Good.
-Anything else?

27:23.558 --> 27:25.185
-Yeah. Wait, wait.
-What?

27:25.685 --> 27:27.228
One for you. Boop.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.814
And one for you. Boop.

27:37.155 --> 27:40.784
The first step to catifying
our catapoop is to cut a feline shape

27:40.867 --> 27:41.910
out of plywood.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.203
This will make it sturdy

27:43.286 --> 27:46.081
and give us the foundation
to attach the foam and the fur.

27:49.292 --> 27:52.170
The purpose of the foam layer
is to give the cat some dimensions,

27:52.253 --> 27:53.505
make it look 3D.

27:53.588 --> 27:56.049
If we cover each one
with a different fur, it'll look good.

27:56.132 --> 27:58.551
I decided I wanted
to make it look a little dumb.

27:58.635 --> 28:01.262
I mean, this thing is flinging poop
for crying out loud.

28:01.346 --> 28:04.015
We're not exactly going
for lifelike and realistic.

28:06.017 --> 28:09.813
The next step is to add the fur.
And before you start calling PETA on me,

28:09.896 --> 28:11.981
calm down, all right? It's all fake.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.490
-It's starting to take shape. Right?
-Adorable.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.786
-It's gonna be like that.
-It looks good.

28:25.495 --> 28:26.746
That's one bad cat.

28:31.459 --> 28:35.171
Oh man, this thing came out
so good. Look at that.

28:35.839 --> 28:38.091
CNC cheat code activated.

28:38.174 --> 28:41.469
Up, up, down, down,
left, right, left, right, CNC.

28:42.053 --> 28:46.141
All right. Let's get this thing popped out
of the plywood and bring it to Jackman.

28:48.226 --> 28:51.104
The CNC cut out my design perfectly,

28:51.187 --> 28:54.566
but I'll still need to use
this oscillating saw to finish the cuts.

28:59.362 --> 29:02.031
Jackman, check out my catwalk.

29:02.115 --> 29:03.241
Ba-bam.

29:03.324 --> 29:05.535
That is a mighty big cat.
What do you think?

29:05.618 --> 29:07.245
Um, yeah. I'm excited.

29:10.707 --> 29:13.001
Oh, wait. You are excited.

29:13.084 --> 29:14.210
-Mm-hm.
-Nice.

29:14.294 --> 29:18.256
What I'm thinking is we can
kind of color this thing and distress it

29:18.339 --> 29:22.302
to match kind of
the rusty-steel look of our trebuchet.

29:22.385 --> 29:23.595
Yep. I like it.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.055
The tail comes up right there.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.141
We can paint that
the same color as the body,

29:28.224 --> 29:30.351
so it looks like the tail whipping around.

29:30.435 --> 29:33.146
What else is there to do on this thing?

29:33.229 --> 29:35.356
This is the pizzazz phase of the build.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.902
Dude, this thing
is gonna be so littered in cat pizzazz.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.238
Have I used up my nine lives of puns?

29:42.322 --> 29:43.239
<i>Ah!</i>

29:43.323 --> 29:44.491
<i>Pun fun.</i>

29:46.326 --> 29:48.536
Okay. Cat eyes.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.830
I'm gonna use black epoxy for the pupils,

29:50.914 --> 29:53.625
and then I'm gonna do
a second pour with white epoxy.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.919
At the end of this,
we should have two nice eyes.

29:56.002 --> 29:56.961
Let's go.

29:58.463 --> 30:03.259
First, I need to make the pupils
by mixing epoxy, hardener, and black ink.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.136
Yeah.

30:07.013 --> 30:10.892
Then, I'll pour a small amount
in each silicon cup and let it dry.

30:11.392 --> 30:13.895
I'm just trying to not screw that up, but…

30:15.104 --> 30:19.859
To make the rest of the eye,
I'll mix epoxy, hardener, and white ink.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.364
Then I'll fill this
to the tippy-top of each cup.

30:28.201 --> 30:31.746
While that dries, I'll make
the kitty a cute little nose on the lathe.

30:44.551 --> 30:48.763
Welding wire is super bendable,
so it's perfect for making whiskers.

30:51.474 --> 30:52.517
Boop.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.563
Then, I just need to add some spray paint.

30:57.772 --> 30:59.440
Take the eyes out of the molding.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.483
<i>Et voila!</i>

31:00.567 --> 31:03.778
We have the most boopable
kitty face outside of Canada.

31:04.612 --> 31:06.281
Hey, Pat, come over, let's check the eyes.

31:06.364 --> 31:07.615
Meow.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.410
Oh my God.

31:11.119 --> 31:13.746
-It looks ridiculous.

31:13.830 --> 31:14.831
It's adorable.

31:14.914 --> 31:17.292
We're gonna add
a little bit more of a muzzle to him.

31:17.375 --> 31:20.003
We have to put some color
inside of his ears.

31:20.086 --> 31:24.048
We've got to put his colored stripes on.
We're in the homestretch. Almost done.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.384
-Come on, kitty.
-Let's bring this thing home.

31:27.176 --> 31:30.263
While, the mechanics
of the catapoop are pretty much in place,

31:31.431 --> 31:34.684
to sell the whole cat thing,
I'm gonna add more patterns to the body.

31:34.767 --> 31:37.812
Derek is gonna add
some more finishing touches to the face.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.481
Looks like he's holding his breath. Boop.

31:40.565 --> 31:44.444
Pat's gonna… Pat's gonna… do Pat stuff.

31:45.445 --> 31:48.197
Jackman and Graz are…
I don't even know what they're doing.

31:48.281 --> 31:51.534
Wrapping the thing in twine?
Seems like a waste of time.

31:51.618 --> 31:52.827
That kind of rhymed.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.790
The last thing Derek has to do
is wrap the tail

31:57.874 --> 32:01.252
in a custom-made,
aerodynamically-shaped litter box.

32:03.046 --> 32:06.132
-Okay. It's a regular litter box we got.
-Yeah.

32:06.716 --> 32:09.302
And Jackman and Graz have moved on to…

32:09.385 --> 32:10.887
Oh, still with the twine.

32:10.970 --> 32:12.013
Kids love twine.

32:13.222 --> 32:14.891
Let's step back and take a look.

32:14.974 --> 32:18.061
I'm not exactly sure how far
a catapoop will launch a turd.

32:18.144 --> 32:20.063
Hopefully, the crap goes past the cat.

32:20.146 --> 32:22.482
Yeah. Looks great though.

32:22.565 --> 32:24.275
But there is one thing
I'm sure of.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.069
-We're done?
-We're done.

32:26.152 --> 32:28.154
At least we finished before midnight.

32:28.237 --> 32:29.948
Don't look now.
Are they still tying a rope?

32:30.031 --> 32:32.200
Of course. They have been
for the last two hours.

32:32.283 --> 32:35.662
You know what's funny? How hard they work,
but nothing ever seems to change.

32:36.162 --> 32:37.497
We can hear you guys.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.958
-Let's get out of here. Let's go eat.
-Okay.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.919
-Interesting.
-Nice work.

32:43.002 --> 32:44.087
All right.

32:44.671 --> 32:45.880
Good night, suckers.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.049
-Bye, guys.
-I'll see you later, Pat.

32:48.132 --> 32:50.218
-Come on. Forget about Paul.
-You lock up.

32:51.094 --> 32:53.721
-You don't need him anymore.
-He's my friend.

32:58.851 --> 33:01.145
You ever been
to one of those medieval restaurants?

33:01.229 --> 33:03.606
No. There was one in Boston,
but I never went.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.483
I never really got it. You know?

33:05.566 --> 33:07.860
-What do you mean?
-You eat with your hands.

33:07.944 --> 33:09.028
How do you eat a taco?

33:10.238 --> 33:12.323
They didn't have knives and forks
in medieval times,

33:12.407 --> 33:14.242
so they're trying to make it feel legit.

33:14.325 --> 33:16.869
They didn't have toilet paper either,
so it was kind of--

33:16.953 --> 33:18.746
At the medieval restaurant?

33:18.830 --> 33:20.999
-Now they do but back then…
-Oh.

33:21.082 --> 33:24.335
All right. Enough of this.
Let's get Jean and Theman up here.

33:25.378 --> 33:28.089
-Jean and Theman. How are you?
-<i>Good.</i>

33:28.172 --> 33:30.967
-We're here because you have cat poop.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

33:31.050 --> 33:32.552
It gave you the idea

33:32.635 --> 33:36.180
that you'd like to see a device
that specifically launches cat poo.

33:36.264 --> 33:37.724
<i>And hopefully they work.</i>

33:38.933 --> 33:41.602
Now, guys, one of these machines
is really awesome

33:41.686 --> 33:44.480
and the other one is probably still being…

33:44.564 --> 33:45.815
Hey. What's up, Jackman?

33:45.898 --> 33:48.359
-Jimmy, great siege weapons take time.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.696
<i>We wanna see this thing.</i>
<i>Can you guys just quit talking?</i>

33:51.779 --> 33:54.032
<i>-We wanna see it.</i>
-<i>Come on, Jimmy.</i>

33:54.115 --> 33:55.658
<i>Come on. Just show it to us!</i>

33:55.742 --> 33:56.659
<i>Yeah. Show it.</i>

33:56.743 --> 34:00.329
Fine, fine, fine. All right.
I know you wanna see, and we'll get to it.

34:00.413 --> 34:01.873
<i>Show it to us!</i>

34:02.540 --> 34:03.624
<i>Oh my gosh.</i>

34:03.708 --> 34:05.877
All right, guys. You heard them.

34:05.960 --> 34:06.794
Hit it!

34:20.224 --> 34:21.642
<i>That is awesome!</i>

34:22.727 --> 34:25.271
-What do you think?
-<i>That's so cool.</i>

34:26.355 --> 34:28.149
<i>I can't believe how big it is.</i>

34:39.368 --> 34:40.328
All right, guys.

34:40.411 --> 34:44.290
What you're looking at here is a medieval
cat-poop-slinging masterpiece.

34:44.373 --> 34:47.293
We have wood, we have rope,
we even have wooden wheels,

34:47.376 --> 34:50.338
just like they would have
made them 500 years ago.

34:50.421 --> 34:53.674
We have a beautiful,
plush stuffed cat on the front,

34:53.758 --> 34:56.844
with real, genuine fake fur that is soft.

34:56.928 --> 34:57.970
You can cuddle with it.

34:58.054 --> 35:00.890
The cat's got a lot of personality
with his crossed eyes,

35:00.973 --> 35:03.059
that big beautiful boopable nose.

35:03.142 --> 35:05.436
-Boop.
<i>-I just wanna… Mmm. Grab it.</i>

35:05.520 --> 35:07.355
<i>-I just want to hug it.</i>
<i>-I know.</i>

35:07.438 --> 35:09.232
And we've added a litter box there

35:09.315 --> 35:12.235
to put some poop in it
and to throw it away.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.153
Wait till you see
this thing in action.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.489
It is going to smash
all the way to Tennessee.

35:16.572 --> 35:18.574
<i>And then we can catch it.</i>

35:20.243 --> 35:23.204
-Okay. Now bring out the trebpoochet!

35:23.287 --> 35:24.330
Here we go!

35:27.041 --> 35:28.626
The ultimate siege weapon.

35:38.761 --> 35:41.806
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

35:42.932 --> 35:44.892
Right here
you're looking at the trebpoochet.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.185
Let me sum it up to you.

35:46.269 --> 35:48.396
It's two big metal triangles
and a lot of math.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.439
-Very exciting.
-Clearly superior.

35:50.523 --> 35:53.693
Are you interested in this?
<i>-No. It's really…</i>

35:53.776 --> 35:55.236
<i>-It's weird.</i>
<i>-Yes. I love it.</i>

35:55.319 --> 35:56.737
Thank you, Theman.

35:57.530 --> 35:58.990
So this here is a trebuchet.

35:59.073 --> 36:02.368
It's not just any trebuchet.
It's a whipping trebuchet.

36:02.451 --> 36:03.911
It's all powered by gravity,

36:03.995 --> 36:06.956
and the more weight plates we put in,
the further it throws.

36:07.039 --> 36:10.084
This is made from steel triangles
welded out of tube steel.

36:10.168 --> 36:13.254
-Triangle's the strongest shape.
<i>-Correct.</i>

36:13.337 --> 36:17.258
Trebuchets are the siege weapons
designed to throw high and far.

36:18.259 --> 36:20.553
-The superior siege weapon.
-Right.

36:20.636 --> 36:23.014
You guys were talking about cat pizzazz.

36:23.097 --> 36:24.974
We wanted to add a different angle,

36:25.057 --> 36:28.895
so we went with a mid-century,
art-deco, steel-looking cat

36:28.978 --> 36:30.146
with spaces in it.

36:30.229 --> 36:32.315
We've got some blue eyes in the front.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.734
This is kind of
the representation of its tail.

36:34.817 --> 36:38.321
And it's gonna throw cat poop
so much further than the catapult.

36:38.404 --> 36:41.365
-What's with the dog paws?
-They're cat paws.

36:41.449 --> 36:44.327
<i>It is not cat paws. They are dog paws.</i>

36:44.410 --> 36:47.705
Jean, Theman, now that you've seen them,
you got a chance to review them,

36:47.788 --> 36:50.041
which one do you think
is gonna throw furthest?

36:50.124 --> 36:51.250
<i>Catapoop.</i>

36:51.334 --> 36:52.627
<i>Trebpoochet.</i>

36:52.710 --> 36:55.671
Let's get these things up there
and have a good old-fashioned poop-off.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.965
-What?
-There's a better way to say that.

36:58.049 --> 37:01.219
Let's get up there and have
a good old-fashioned poop toss!

37:01.302 --> 37:03.554
-Yeah.

37:21.614 --> 37:25.117
Welcome to the first-ever
cat-poop-slinging competition.

37:25.201 --> 37:28.204
A competition that shouldn't exist,
but it does because I'm an idiot

37:28.287 --> 37:29.914
and I signed up to do this show.

37:29.997 --> 37:33.376
-<i>Beautiful. So beautiful.</i>

37:33.459 --> 37:35.086
It's time to put up or shut up.

37:35.169 --> 37:37.672
Each team can pick a turd
from either the litter box

37:37.755 --> 37:39.674
or the scratching post. It's up to them.

37:39.757 --> 37:42.718
All right, guys. Which one
do you want to see perform first?

37:43.219 --> 37:44.303
<i>-Catapoop.</i>
<i>-Catapoop.</i>

37:44.387 --> 37:47.473
Catapoop. Start with the best,
be underwhelmed by the rest.

37:47.556 --> 37:50.977
All right, gentlemen. You heard the kids.
Let's load up these turds!

37:52.728 --> 37:54.146
Yeah. This is hard.

37:54.230 --> 37:55.773
I hear cracking.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.817
-You ready?
-That's it.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.778
Tighten up the rope
with the wedge and the mallet.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.990
Let's lock and load the ammo.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.538
-Derek, don't touch it with your hands.
-Derek.

38:10.621 --> 38:12.164
-Don't lick your fingers.
-All right.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.792
This thing is ready to go crazy.

38:14.875 --> 38:17.169
<i>It's gonna go over the fence.</i>
<i>I can tell you that much.</i>

38:17.253 --> 38:19.547
All right, guys.
You ready to count it down?

38:19.630 --> 38:20.881
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:21.549 --> 38:25.386
<i>Three, two, one. Go!</i>

38:41.610 --> 38:43.070
Guys, what the hell happened?

38:43.154 --> 38:45.323
We just barely made it
over the cat's head on the shot.

38:45.406 --> 38:49.327
If we had this right up to the fence,
it goes clear over the fence.

38:49.410 --> 38:52.830
We needed more tension on the rope.
Derek, we should have wet it--

38:52.913 --> 38:54.498
Jimmy, Jimmy, enough.

38:54.582 --> 38:57.626
It's now time
to show you what math can do.

39:16.103 --> 39:17.480
<i>What are you doing?</i>

39:17.563 --> 39:19.940
That's what I've been asking myself
for the last three days.

39:20.608 --> 39:23.110
<i>Come on. I want it shoot.</i>

39:23.194 --> 39:26.697
Coming soon in season two,
they shoot the trebuchet.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.991
Guys, choose your turds!

39:32.161 --> 39:35.581
Behold, the magic turd cannonball.

39:37.416 --> 39:39.377
You guys gotta beat 15 feet!

39:39.460 --> 39:41.670
The bar has been set on the ground.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.339
This is an easy win.

39:43.422 --> 39:45.049
Ready, Theman? Count me down.

39:45.132 --> 39:49.637
<i>Three, two, one. Go!</i>

40:00.439 --> 40:01.774
Whoa!

40:15.287 --> 40:17.373
Look at that! It's rolling away.

40:21.502 --> 40:23.921
<i>Oh, my gosh. That was so far.</i>

40:24.004 --> 40:24.964
Wow!

40:26.090 --> 40:28.467
-Dude, that went so high.

40:28.551 --> 40:31.512
<i>Will one of y'all</i>
<i>go and check where that landed?</i>

40:31.595 --> 40:33.889
Theman, we can't go into space.

40:33.973 --> 40:37.268
Fine. As much as I hate to say it,
I think we have a clear winner.

40:37.351 --> 40:39.728
Oh, by the way, Graz. Here's your trophy.

40:41.689 --> 40:43.482
-That's a nice trophy.
-Hello. Oh.

40:43.566 --> 40:46.735
Now, level with me.
Which one do you think looks better?

40:46.819 --> 40:49.113
<i>I like the catapoop way better.</i>

40:49.196 --> 40:51.991
We win the style game.
You guys win the…

40:52.074 --> 40:54.577
The first time ever
you've won a style game.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.414
Jean, Theman, you wanted
to see cat poop fly,

40:58.497 --> 41:00.249
and for whatever reason
we made that happen.

41:00.332 --> 41:01.584
-Okay?
<i>-Okay.</i>

41:01.667 --> 41:03.002
We're finished.

41:04.128 --> 41:07.214
Gentlemen, you sure know
how to sling some crap. Well done.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.467
-Proud of you.
-Proud of you too.

41:09.550 --> 41:12.261
Now go find the cat turd
so the dog doesn't eat it.

41:12.344 --> 41:14.263
-We know where ours are.

41:14.346 --> 41:16.765
-Let's go.
-Same rules. Winner cleans up?

41:16.849 --> 41:18.142
-Yep.
-Losers clean up.

41:18.225 --> 41:19.435
Where did that go?
