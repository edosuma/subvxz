00:39.587 --> 00:40.822
<i>There he is.</i>

00:42.755 --> 00:44.557
<i>Who paid you?</i>

00:44.591 --> 00:46.658
- <i>I don't know. I don't...</i>
- <i>Who fucking paid you?</i>

00:46.692 --> 00:48.794
<i>I don't know!
It was all online!</i>

00:48.828 --> 00:51.096
<i>I never saw them!
I don't wanna I die!</i>

00:51.129 --> 00:54.631
<i>I don't know, put it down.</i>

00:54.664 --> 00:56.800
<i>So there I was,</i>

00:56.834 --> 00:59.970
<i>having the time of my life
at the party of the century.</i>

01:00.003 --> 01:01.537
Fuck!

01:01.570 --> 01:02.938
- <i>Singing, dancing...</i>
- Shit.

01:02.972 --> 01:06.573
<i>...making merry
in a fine borrowed tux,</i>

01:06.607 --> 01:10.476
<i>when I remembered I hadn't checked
my email in quite some time.</i>

01:10.509 --> 01:13.479
<i>Suddenly, everyone and their
dog needs to use the computer.</i>

01:13.512 --> 01:15.915
<i>So, I log out,
just to make sure</i>

01:15.948 --> 01:19.516
<i>I didn't leave any private
information on someone else's desktop.</i>

01:19.550 --> 01:21.987
<i>I take a little stroll outside,
because you know what,</i>

01:22.019 --> 01:24.855
<i>I actually read somewhere that fresh
air can boost your serotonin levels,</i>

01:24.889 --> 01:27.489
<i>by like, 300%, for real.</i>

01:27.522 --> 01:30.058
<i>Anyway, next thing you know...</i>

01:30.092 --> 01:34.161
<i>Boom, rocked by
a sudden explosion.</i>

01:34.195 --> 01:36.630
<i>Completely caught off-guard.</i>

01:36.663 --> 01:38.797
<i>I mean, believe it or not,
I'm falling through the sky</i>

01:38.832 --> 01:40.666
<i>like an apple
over Newton's head.</i>

01:40.699 --> 01:44.003
<i>By the time I hit the ground,
it's lights out.</i>

01:44.036 --> 01:48.139
<i>And, uh, things have been
a little fuzzy ever since.</i>

01:52.775 --> 01:55.610
<i>Need I remind you
of the severity</i>

01:55.644 --> 01:59.014
of the charges
you're facing right now?

01:59.047 --> 02:04.919
High treason, espionage,
terrorism, murder.

02:04.952 --> 02:07.653
Huh? Murder? I mean...

02:07.686 --> 02:09.222
Charles Bundwig.

02:10.554 --> 02:13.557
Charles Bundwig?

02:13.591 --> 02:15.192
Uh, Your Honor,
how is that my fault?

02:15.226 --> 02:17.862
Uh, you can blame that
on penis envy over here.

02:17.895 --> 02:19.963
Your Honor, are you
going to put up with this?

02:19.996 --> 02:22.463
May we please just walk you
through the evidence?

02:22.497 --> 02:24.166
It'll be obvious
that he's guilty.

02:24.199 --> 02:26.167
Yeah, lay out the evidence,
Mike.

02:26.200 --> 02:28.036
Can you believe the audacity
of this little prick?

02:28.069 --> 02:30.770
Do you have any idea who you
are addressing in this court

02:30.804 --> 02:32.705
and the experience
that these people have?

02:32.738 --> 02:33.973
Order.

02:36.275 --> 02:37.943
Mike, true,

02:37.976 --> 02:39.710
this is not the most ideal way

02:39.743 --> 02:42.478
to go about this
unprecedented hearing.

02:42.512 --> 02:43.814
Explosions?

02:43.847 --> 02:48.151
But apparently,
Mr. Black is the evidence.

02:48.184 --> 02:51.954
So albeit extreme, if you
want this court's assistance,

02:51.987 --> 02:55.156
you're gonna have to wait till
our questions have been satisfied.

02:56.223 --> 02:57.191
Yes, Your Honor.

02:57.224 --> 02:59.125
When you're ready, Mr. Black,

02:59.159 --> 03:00.827
take us back to the beginning.

03:00.860 --> 03:04.029
How did you first
get involved with Cicada 3301?

03:04.063 --> 03:08.933
And let's make sure
we stick to the facts.

03:12.970 --> 03:14.837
<i>Actually,
actually, back it up a few.</i>

03:14.870 --> 03:17.239
<i>You're probably wondering
which one of us started it.</i>

03:24.111 --> 03:28.081
- I hate that guy.
- Hello? Snap to, bitch.

03:28.114 --> 03:29.915
What is taking so long?

03:29.948 --> 03:31.984
William J. Edwards III.

03:32.017 --> 03:34.118
Tori, don't let that guy
see you sweat. Come on, girl.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.798
Next time, move your ass.

03:54.066 --> 03:57.003
Fifty cents.
Are you kidding me?

03:57.936 --> 03:59.838
Stop it. Stop. Stop.

03:59.871 --> 04:02.239
Oh, shit.
Hey, Brooks Brother.

04:02.272 --> 04:05.575
No disrespect, but I can tell by
your, uh, Bob Ross the painter,

04:05.608 --> 04:07.043
little vest jacket thing
you got going on,

04:07.076 --> 04:08.244
you're probably
not from around here,

04:08.277 --> 04:09.611
but what my colleague
was trying to say

04:09.644 --> 04:10.912
is people around here
on most nights,

04:10.946 --> 04:12.848
tip about 20%
for quality service.

04:12.881 --> 04:13.914
Which is
really important to her

04:13.948 --> 04:14.849
because that's how she keeps

04:14.882 --> 04:15.883
the light bulbs flickering,

04:15.916 --> 04:17.684
you get me, pal?

04:17.716 --> 04:19.119
Yeah. And I guess
I'm telling you

04:19.152 --> 04:20.552
I didn't get quality service.

04:20.586 --> 04:22.821
Fair enough. I get it.

04:22.855 --> 04:24.823
Maybe she had an off night.

04:24.857 --> 04:27.691
But still, on average,
I'd say 15% is pretty standard.

04:27.724 --> 04:28.993
Okay. And then what would
that equate to?

04:29.027 --> 04:32.929
About $12.65 on the bill
totaling $96.96.

04:32.963 --> 04:34.897
In which case I'll say,
Tori...

04:34.930 --> 04:37.066
Come on, baby,
put some pep in your step.

04:37.099 --> 04:38.599
But no, you dropped 50 cents.

04:38.632 --> 04:42.903
Equating to what,
.593% on a bill that's $84.31?

04:42.936 --> 04:46.339
That's just not fair, man.
Come on.

04:46.372 --> 04:48.640
Are you some kind of
walking calculator freak?

04:49.708 --> 04:51.810
Yeah, something like that.

04:52.778 --> 04:53.978
Count this.

05:05.254 --> 05:07.321
<i>Keep your elbow
at a 90-degree angle, Connor.</i>

05:07.355 --> 05:10.190
<i>The table's ours.</i>

05:10.223 --> 05:12.292
<i>You didn't hear what I said?</i>

05:12.325 --> 05:13.760
<i>My boy can outshoot
the both of you</i>

05:13.793 --> 05:14.894
<i>with his eyes closed.</i>

05:18.863 --> 05:21.232
<i>You wanna put your money
where you mouth is?</i>

05:21.266 --> 05:22.866
<i>You rack 'em.</i>

05:30.072 --> 05:31.639
<i>There it is.</i>

05:32.874 --> 05:33.941
Yes.

05:33.974 --> 05:35.242
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

05:35.276 --> 05:36.343
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

05:36.377 --> 05:38.044
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

05:43.115 --> 05:45.117
I think I figured it out,
William.

05:54.356 --> 05:56.292
<i>Uh, I'm sure you get the idea.</i>

06:47.063 --> 06:49.265
<i>Is having
an eidetic memory a crime?</i>

06:49.298 --> 06:53.235
Eight-nine-seven-six,
William J. Edwards III.

06:53.268 --> 06:54.902
<i>So I have perfect recall.</i>

06:54.935 --> 06:57.071
<i>Told a couple of kind strangers
on the dark net</i>

06:57.104 --> 06:59.372
<i>about some douchebag's
credit card.</i>

06:59.405 --> 07:02.941
<i>It's not my fault that they go
maxing it out without consent.</i>

07:02.975 --> 07:06.310
<i>And, yes, I cyber-stalked the guy
and sent him a virus ridden email.</i>

07:06.344 --> 07:09.046
<i>Big deal.</i>

07:09.080 --> 07:11.181
<i>Let he who has not
gained access</i>

07:11.214 --> 07:13.116
<i>to someone else's computer
by malware</i>

07:13.150 --> 07:16.218
<i>throw the first stone,
am I right?</i>

07:16.252 --> 07:20.021
<i>Fucking guy deserved it.
Fifty cent tip.</i>

07:20.054 --> 07:21.788
Fucking Bruce Lee.

07:21.822 --> 07:25.025
<i>That douchebag was, like,
this close to getting killed.</i>

07:25.058 --> 07:27.894
<i>I know, I know.
You're so merciful.</i>

07:27.927 --> 07:30.996
<i>Now, even I was
surprised by the whole Bitcoin thing.</i>

07:31.029 --> 07:34.365
<i>It's not my fault his wallet
wasn't in cold storage.</i>

07:39.369 --> 07:40.837
Holy shit.

07:40.870 --> 07:45.440
<i>I had theories about K-1 algorithms
that could hack into Bitcoin.</i>

07:45.474 --> 07:47.808
<i>But I didn't think
it would actually work.</i>

07:47.842 --> 07:52.112
<i>So I considered taking his Bitcoin
an act of God, if you will.</i>

07:52.145 --> 07:54.180
<i>If we're bringing
insurance into this.</i>

07:58.349 --> 08:02.252
<i>Now, the Cicada files.</i>

08:02.286 --> 08:05.189
<i>That's a click of the mouse
I sincerely regret.</i>

08:06.923 --> 08:08.291
<i>I should've backed out
of his computer</i>

08:08.324 --> 08:09.824
<i>and called it a night.</i>

08:11.193 --> 08:13.228
<i>Curiosity kills.</i>

08:14.461 --> 08:17.097
<i>A quick search
showed Cicada 3301</i>

08:17.131 --> 08:20.833
<i>had been headhunting super geniuses
from around the world for years</i>

08:20.867 --> 08:25.103
<i>using this kind of
intellectual scavenger hunt.</i>

08:27.805 --> 08:30.440
Kinda dark, but, okay.

08:30.473 --> 08:33.109
<i>I thought I'd give
the test a try.</i>

08:33.143 --> 08:35.077
<i>It was a simple Caesar cipher.</i>

08:35.110 --> 08:37.413
<i>Took two seconds to crack.</i>

08:37.446 --> 08:39.914
<i>Out popped
a giant middle finger.</i>

08:59.028 --> 09:01.497
Not smart enough. Fuck face.

09:01.531 --> 09:04.533
Fuck! Shit! Shit!

09:04.566 --> 09:06.500
Goddammit!

09:09.070 --> 09:10.804
Goddammit.

09:15.941 --> 09:18.776
<i>That little outburst
would haunt me.</i>

09:45.030 --> 09:46.063
Yeah?

09:46.097 --> 09:48.065
I ain't got all day.

09:50.934 --> 09:52.335
Pay your shit, Connor.

09:52.369 --> 09:53.769
What?

09:59.140 --> 10:02.509
- Well I will, I just, you know...
- Pay your shit.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.011
Language, please.

10:09.015 --> 10:10.515
Let me get my keys.

10:13.884 --> 10:14.918
Shh.

10:17.354 --> 10:18.921
Shit.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.133
Dude, come on, man.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.869
Look, got a little lady here.

10:37.869 --> 10:39.103
Seen him say way worse.

10:39.137 --> 10:43.940
Hey, I'm gonna pay you tonight.
I promise.

10:47.576 --> 10:50.078
Come on, dude.

10:53.014 --> 10:55.215
Tonight, I promise.

10:57.318 --> 10:59.018
- Mm-hm.
- Come on.

10:59.052 --> 11:00.486
Tonight...

11:00.520 --> 11:01.586
I will.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.422
We're aware
no one in your building

11:03.455 --> 11:05.489
had anything to do with this.

11:16.131 --> 11:17.132
Such a dick.

11:17.166 --> 11:19.167
How did you
become involved with

11:19.200 --> 11:21.968
your deceased accomplice,
Gwen Schafer?

11:22.002 --> 11:24.905
That's funny you should ask.

11:25.638 --> 11:27.873
I was just getting to her.

11:30.475 --> 11:33.178
<i>The worst librarian ever.</i>

11:34.345 --> 11:36.080
What happened to Gladys?

11:36.580 --> 11:37.947
She croaked.

11:39.649 --> 11:42.250
Mm. <i>Ulysses.</i>

11:42.284 --> 11:44.386
Ostentatious as hell.

11:44.419 --> 11:48.189
So what, he created
stream of consciousness.

11:48.222 --> 11:50.523
Portrait of the reader
as a bored woman...

11:51.991 --> 11:53.026
Hm.

11:53.059 --> 11:54.293
Unless you're
just gonna pretend

11:54.326 --> 11:55.527
to read it in a cafe

11:55.561 --> 11:57.096
so you can get
some barista booty.

11:57.129 --> 11:58.629
Yeah, thought so.

11:58.664 --> 12:01.431
- Celine writes his ass off.
- Hey.

12:01.465 --> 12:03.900
I'm pretty sure you can't
use ass in front of a kid.

12:03.934 --> 12:05.102
Ass.

12:05.135 --> 12:07.636
She's reading
<i>Island of the Blue Dolphins.</i>

12:07.671 --> 12:10.105
I think she's mature enough
to hear the word ass.

12:10.138 --> 12:12.040
- Ass.
- See?

12:12.073 --> 12:15.309
Careful, this book might make you
wanna move to a deserted island

12:15.342 --> 12:17.343
for the rest of your life.

12:17.377 --> 12:19.178
Sounds fun.

12:19.212 --> 12:21.446
Personal time
on the computer, huh?

12:21.480 --> 12:24.516
I'm pretty sure
that's frowned upon. Hm.

12:25.950 --> 12:28.352
Okay. Next.

12:28.386 --> 12:30.453
Tell me, is the Cicada thing
for real or not?

12:30.487 --> 12:32.021
Cicada the bug?

12:32.055 --> 12:34.089
Cicada the secret society.

12:34.123 --> 12:36.191
Sounds cool.
What do they do?

12:37.126 --> 12:39.894
Yeah, Gwen.
What do they do?

12:42.496 --> 12:44.998
It's all conjecture.
They're illusive.

12:45.031 --> 12:47.967
Kind of like the IT Department
of the Illuminati.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.170
But everyone who knows them knows
that they wanna change the world.

12:52.203 --> 12:53.971
<i>And your other accomplice?</i>

12:54.004 --> 12:57.040
Avi had nothing to do with this.

12:57.074 --> 12:59.142
It's all my fault.
I dragged Avi into this.

12:59.175 --> 13:01.476
Lying sack of shit.

13:01.510 --> 13:03.078
Did you hear that?

13:03.111 --> 13:04.714
He's got dick hair
stuck in his throat.

13:04.747 --> 13:06.715
- Fuck you, man.
- Gentlemen.

13:06.748 --> 13:09.449
You and Avi Baginski
were close friends growing up.

13:09.482 --> 13:10.651
We're best friends.

13:10.684 --> 13:12.285
So you expect us to believe

13:12.318 --> 13:15.954
that he had no idea
what you were up to?

13:19.991 --> 13:21.659
<i>You know, when most
guys hang out with their buddies,</i>

13:21.692 --> 13:24.528
<i>it means drinks at the bar,
chasing tail.</i>

13:24.561 --> 13:28.063
<i>Not Avi. Our paths didn't
exactly cross by chance.</i>

13:28.097 --> 13:30.265
I see what you did there.
I see what you did there.

13:30.298 --> 13:32.033
But not today. Mm-mm.

13:32.066 --> 13:35.436
Today, the title of park
grand champion belongs to me.

13:38.705 --> 13:40.973
- Queen is mine.
- Oh, my God.

13:41.007 --> 13:42.207
Hey, Avi.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.275
Oh, hey!

13:43.308 --> 13:44.976
What's up, man?

13:45.010 --> 13:46.410
It's gonna be a minute.

13:46.444 --> 13:48.045
It's important.

13:50.547 --> 13:52.482
Avi, important, hurry up, man.

13:52.515 --> 13:54.016
Shh.

13:59.520 --> 14:01.155
Hey, can you move it along?

14:01.189 --> 14:03.290
'Cause we have some life
and death shit to discuss.

14:03.323 --> 14:05.192
Will you shut up for a second?

14:05.225 --> 14:06.559
Sorry, guys.

14:12.330 --> 14:13.997
Check.

14:14.031 --> 14:16.668
Avi, Queen to G2 in seven.
Game over, let's go.

14:16.701 --> 14:18.601
- Hey, hey.
- Why would you do that, man?

14:18.635 --> 14:21.170
- Hey, who the hell are you?
- Man, why would you...?

14:21.204 --> 14:23.104
Such a ding-a-ling.

14:23.138 --> 14:24.139
Come on.

14:24.172 --> 14:25.406
Say hi to Dino.

14:25.439 --> 14:27.475
I don't... I don't even
really know him. Honest.

14:27.508 --> 14:29.143
Do you know how long
I've been trying to get to...

14:29.176 --> 14:30.543
on that center table?

14:30.577 --> 14:32.278
They'll be dead tomorrow.

14:32.312 --> 14:35.080
Well, I hope, that's the only
way you can get in.

14:35.113 --> 14:36.148
One of them has to die.

14:36.181 --> 14:38.115
Look, the shit that I've been
telling you about,

14:38.149 --> 14:40.251
it's been going on
for a couple of years now.

14:40.284 --> 14:42.787
It seems like every year,

14:42.820 --> 14:45.521
the very few will get to the end
of this game and just disappear.

14:45.554 --> 14:47.389
But it's not like
it's a nefarious thing,

14:47.423 --> 14:48.658
it's-it's like an ascension.

14:48.692 --> 14:51.092
They find something great
to be a part of

14:51.125 --> 14:52.460
on a societal plane.

14:52.494 --> 14:54.629
It's like the apple
in the worm, right?

14:54.662 --> 14:56.631
You ever wonder how the worm
gets inside the apple?

14:56.664 --> 14:58.297
- Mm-mm.
- There's no hole.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.666
Same thing, man. Thanks.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.566
I wonder how this hotdog
is gonna get into my mouth,

15:01.601 --> 15:03.168
but I-I got the answer to that.

15:03.201 --> 15:05.804
Hey, can I get some extra napkins?
Thanks, man.

15:05.837 --> 15:07.271
Shit...

15:08.105 --> 15:09.439
Appreciate it.

15:10.774 --> 15:12.175
He got it.

15:13.342 --> 15:14.343
To cover the soda.

15:14.376 --> 15:17.045
The female fly
impregnates the apple

15:17.079 --> 15:19.547
on a microscopic level,
imperceptible to the world around it,

15:19.580 --> 15:22.650
and then when a larva hatches,
it infiltrates the apple through its core.

15:22.683 --> 15:23.718
But if I'm right about this,

15:23.751 --> 15:25.351
then I'm right about
what Cicada is really all about,

15:25.384 --> 15:26.786
metaphorically speaking,
you understand?

15:26.820 --> 15:28.387
So I could bring about change
the way I really want

15:28.420 --> 15:29.722
in this motherfucking world.

15:29.755 --> 15:32.557
Thirty-four seconds.

15:32.590 --> 15:34.057
What?

15:34.091 --> 15:35.425
Oh, that's how long
you've been talking

15:35.459 --> 15:37.794
since your last breath.
I was keeping track.

15:37.828 --> 15:39.495
What? You're not even
listening to what I'm saying.

15:39.529 --> 15:40.664
Of course
I'm listening, man.

15:40.697 --> 15:42.364
That's all you're
letting me do is listen.

15:42.397 --> 15:44.767
With all these apples and worms,
and secret societies.

15:44.800 --> 15:49.069
But what I truly wanna know is
what are you running from?

15:50.738 --> 15:52.840
Who's running away from what?

15:52.873 --> 15:54.741
What are you talking about?
Avi, I'm not...

15:54.774 --> 15:57.275
I'm-I'm... I told
you something I'm excited about,

15:57.308 --> 15:59.310
and you tell me I'm running
away from my problems.

15:59.343 --> 16:00.311
This is just like you.

16:00.344 --> 16:02.813
I hit you with the truth
and you gotta attack me.

16:02.847 --> 16:05.214
What truth, man? Come on.

16:08.818 --> 16:10.184
What happened to your hand?

16:10.819 --> 16:12.520
Some ketchup on it.

16:12.554 --> 16:13.821
No, it's not ketchup.

16:13.855 --> 16:16.557
Who'd you beat up this time?

16:16.591 --> 16:18.625
Come on, man.

16:18.659 --> 16:21.126
Look, man, maybe you're
not ready to be out of jail, man.

16:21.159 --> 16:22.628
You can't be
with civilized people.

16:22.662 --> 16:25.095
Maybe jail
is the best thing for you.

16:25.797 --> 16:28.733
What the fuck, Avi?

16:28.767 --> 16:30.734
I come to the park
to see my best friend,

16:30.768 --> 16:32.535
spend some quality time
with you,

16:32.569 --> 16:35.470
come help you out
with a couple of chess moves.

16:35.504 --> 16:38.306
I try to open up to you about
something I've just discovered

16:38.339 --> 16:42.375
that might be quite important,
and you shit on me, man.

16:42.409 --> 16:44.177
Tell me I'm fucking
running away from my problems

16:44.210 --> 16:45.745
and... I'm going back to jail.
Whatever.

16:45.779 --> 16:49.715
What the fuck you talking about?
You're unreal.

16:49.748 --> 16:51.149
Just wondering if I could
borrow some money.

16:51.182 --> 16:52.450
This is the part
where you ask me for money.

16:52.483 --> 16:54.484
- Yeah. What do you need?
- Computer crashed.

16:54.518 --> 16:56.186
Computer crashed?
That's it?

16:56.219 --> 16:57.553
I mean, how much could
a new computer cost?

16:57.588 --> 16:59.656
- That can't be too much.
- Ah...

17:01.256 --> 17:02.457
About 900.

17:02.490 --> 17:03.893
- Nine hundred?
- Mm.

17:03.926 --> 17:06.160
You're doing all this
talking over for $900?

17:06.193 --> 17:07.227
- Man, of course...
- Yeah, man.

17:07.261 --> 17:09.429
- Exactly.
- That's important. You need that.

17:09.462 --> 17:11.164
But it's a lot for me
and not a lot for you.

17:11.196 --> 17:12.332
That's important.
I can't have my man

17:12.365 --> 17:13.633
out there with no computer.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.267
Yeah, no problem.
Hold on.

17:15.300 --> 17:19.303
It's somewhere right here,
okay?

17:19.337 --> 17:21.872
That's for you.
See you next time.

17:40.654 --> 17:42.888
Oh, God. No, no, no.

17:42.922 --> 17:45.456
Come on, man.

17:58.934 --> 18:01.267
You've gotta be kidding me, man.

18:02.302 --> 18:04.170
Come on, you can't do that.

18:14.912 --> 18:20.549
Please, let me just go inside,
grab my things.

18:50.405 --> 18:51.674
What's up, old-timer?

18:51.707 --> 18:52.708
The hell are you doing here?

18:52.741 --> 18:54.241
What, I can't just
check up on you?

18:54.274 --> 18:55.843
I'm fine.
I'm making dinner.

18:55.877 --> 18:58.277
Oh, yeah? What's that?
Lucky Charms?

18:58.310 --> 19:00.246
Your mom home?

19:00.279 --> 19:02.247
Nope. Why?

19:02.280 --> 19:04.983
Soph, I got to use your computer.
My computer exploded.

19:05.016 --> 19:08.485
I got to fire off one email, please,
please, please, please, please.

19:08.519 --> 19:10.888
- Use your phone.
- My phone's in the car.

19:14.791 --> 19:17.324
When you lie,
it robs me of the chance

19:17.358 --> 19:18.492
to be a real friend to you.

19:18.526 --> 19:21.796
Which means you really only
steal stuff from yourself.

19:21.829 --> 19:25.665
Soph, can I just... Please, just...
I'll be quick. Please.

19:25.699 --> 19:27.867
All right.
The computer's in there.

19:27.901 --> 19:29.902
Ah. You're the man.

19:29.935 --> 19:31.837
Just pay your shit, Connor.

19:31.870 --> 19:32.904
I'm gonna pay my shit.

19:32.937 --> 19:33.938
The card wasn't working

19:33.971 --> 19:35.540
when I was withdrawing money.

19:35.573 --> 19:36.907
Why am I even
telling you this?

19:39.341 --> 19:40.910
Yes. Come here, baby.

19:42.044 --> 19:43.813
Come to me, mama.

19:45.479 --> 19:47.782
<i>I had to find
a tumbler and quick.</i>

19:47.816 --> 19:49.750
<i>Cash would fix
everything for me,</i>

19:49.783 --> 19:51.685
<i>but without
doing some laundry first,</i>

19:51.719 --> 19:54.921
<i>those Bitcoins
I had were worthless.</i>

20:00.925 --> 20:04.961
Fucking thief. Fucking 50%.

20:17.671 --> 20:19.271
No, no, no, no.

20:23.709 --> 20:25.476
- What the fuck is this?!
- No, no, no, no.

20:25.509 --> 20:26.678
- I'm fixing this.
- Oh, hell no!

20:26.711 --> 20:28.345
It's not what it seems.
I'm fixing this!

20:28.378 --> 20:29.646
Get the hell out of my house!

20:29.680 --> 20:30.781
I'm trying to fix
the computer!

20:30.814 --> 20:32.616
- Mama, wait! Mama, wait!
- Don't worry, I got this.

20:32.649 --> 20:33.616
I'm trying to
fix the computer.

20:33.649 --> 20:37.986
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

20:38.019 --> 20:41.387
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

20:42.422 --> 20:44.290
Oh, damn.

20:58.334 --> 20:59.636
That's him.

20:59.669 --> 21:00.970
That's him.

21:02.104 --> 21:04.039
We have eyes on the suspect.

21:04.073 --> 21:05.540
Don't run.

21:06.674 --> 21:09.408
Oh, don't-don't do this.

21:09.442 --> 21:12.478
- He's a runner.
- He just said don't fucking run.

21:18.650 --> 21:20.652
Put your hands in the air,
bitch.

21:21.018 --> 21:22.385
Shit.

21:22.418 --> 21:23.954
I told you not to run, boy.

21:23.988 --> 21:26.856
Bullshit.
What are you arresting me for?

21:26.890 --> 21:28.525
You know what this is for,
you little bitch.

21:28.558 --> 21:32.493
Oh, hell yeah!
Karma, bitch! Karma!

21:32.528 --> 21:34.494
Fuck the motherfucker up!

21:34.529 --> 21:37.396
Oh, yeah, we're gonna
fuck this guy real good.

21:37.429 --> 21:38.965
You're all mine now.

21:38.999 --> 21:41.534
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Come on.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.536
You can have him when I'm done.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.805
Hey.

21:46.838 --> 21:48.640
Sophie, don't watch.

21:48.673 --> 21:49.973
Oh, yeah.

21:50.007 --> 21:52.075
Charlie, get your dick
inside of him, yeah.

21:52.109 --> 21:53.109
The fuck that happened!

21:53.142 --> 21:54.442
- That is...
- Your Honor!

21:54.476 --> 21:55.878
- Your Honor, this is...
- Fuck you, man.

21:55.912 --> 21:58.079
- That did not happen.
- Have a seat, Agent Sullivan.

21:58.113 --> 22:01.515
- You try that shit again...
- Have a seat, now!

22:01.549 --> 22:02.850
That never happened,
I just wanted...-

22:02.883 --> 22:04.450
- Did you hear me?
- Sit down.

22:04.484 --> 22:05.417
- I didn't take my...
- Sit down.

22:05.450 --> 22:08.353
- My pants off.
- Sit down!

22:08.387 --> 22:09.755
Fuck.

22:11.123 --> 22:12.957
- Mr. Black?
- Yes?

22:12.990 --> 22:14.826
You make a
mockery of this courtroom again

22:14.859 --> 22:16.860
and we will end
these proceedings immediately.

22:16.893 --> 22:20.730
Now, I'd wager that you'd
prefer to continue a dialogue

22:20.763 --> 22:22.430
with the United States.

22:22.463 --> 22:24.633
Am I correct in that assertion?

22:26.134 --> 22:29.368
Your Honor, I'm terribly sor...
I've been through tons.

22:29.402 --> 22:30.904
It's-it's been stressful.

22:30.938 --> 22:33.806
I might be
misremembering a couple things.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.875
The prosecution would
like to note for the record,

22:35.908 --> 22:38.076
that Mr. Black
just declared under oath

22:38.109 --> 22:42.079
that he is unable to accurately
remember the facts of this case.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.647
- Noted.
- Shit.

22:43.681 --> 22:45.582
Continue with your testimony,

22:45.615 --> 22:49.685
and no more misremembering,
for your sake.

22:55.923 --> 22:57.657
Mr. Black.

22:58.592 --> 22:59.826
Yeah?

23:01.060 --> 23:03.428
Let's do this all over again,
shall we?

23:03.461 --> 23:06.430
I'm Agent Sullivan,
this is my partner, Agent Carver.

23:06.463 --> 23:07.765
- Oh, we've met.
- Hi.

23:07.799 --> 23:10.033
- How's it going?
- Good, how are you?

23:10.067 --> 23:14.402
Um, we'd love to chat for a
second if you're not too busy.

23:14.436 --> 23:17.105
No, now is actually perfect.

23:17.138 --> 23:20.041
Oh, great.
Oh, great, great because, uh,

23:20.075 --> 23:22.843
we've been watching you like a
goddamn hawk for the last couple days.

23:22.877 --> 23:25.410
Like what you see?

23:25.444 --> 23:27.180
Let's see how cute you are

23:27.213 --> 23:29.447
when I bash
your fucking face in!

23:29.481 --> 23:32.017
Jesus, Carver.
Carver, take it down a notch.

23:32.050 --> 23:33.150
Just take it down a notch.

23:33.184 --> 23:35.853
I thought you said
I was bad cop?

23:35.887 --> 23:41.757
No. No. I said...
I said you're a bad cop.

23:41.790 --> 23:43.759
Do your bosses
know you've kidnapped me?

23:43.792 --> 23:45.994
Waylaid. Big difference.
And yes.

23:46.027 --> 23:48.196
Waylaid. Mm, okay.
So you legally kidnapped me.

23:48.229 --> 23:52.599
Look, we're trying to give you the
chance to not go to prison, all right?

23:52.633 --> 23:55.768
God, I wanna fucking hit you
so bad right now.

23:55.801 --> 23:58.904
- Carver...
- You're so fucking st... You're stupid.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.105
Carver.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.707
We would like your help
with something.

24:04.741 --> 24:07.610
Is that how you
ask people for help?

24:07.644 --> 24:09.912
Look, you got two choices here:

24:09.945 --> 24:13.681
Choice numero uno, you say goodbye to
that pointless little life you live,

24:13.714 --> 24:15.917
and we throw your ass
back in prison right now.

24:15.950 --> 24:19.586
We hold you without bail on,
I don't know, 60 charges?

24:19.619 --> 24:22.187
One or two of which may or
may not be true.

24:22.221 --> 24:25.590
And then...
and this is my favorite part.

24:25.623 --> 24:27.625
Mm-hm.

24:27.659 --> 24:32.062
I crawl in a-a little fucking hole
in your cell while you're sleeping,

24:32.095 --> 24:35.765
and I gnaw your tiny,
little dick off...

24:35.798 --> 24:37.532
- Carver! What the fuck?!
- ...for all fucking times.

24:37.565 --> 24:39.634
Carver, what the fu...?

24:39.668 --> 24:40.935
That's completely inappropriate!

24:40.968 --> 24:42.970
What the fuck?
Why you talking about his dick?

24:43.003 --> 24:44.704
It was meant...
it was a torture reference.

24:44.737 --> 24:45.605
It's not fucking torture.

24:45.638 --> 24:47.140
It's fucking weird.
Isn't that weird?

24:47.173 --> 24:49.074
Why does it always
have to be sexual with you?

24:49.107 --> 24:51.610
- It's fucking embarrassing.
- I thought that would hurt really bad...

24:51.643 --> 24:53.044
No. It-it's just fucking weird.

24:53.077 --> 24:54.745
What's option number two?

24:58.148 --> 25:01.951
Choice number two,
you get your ass back to hunting Cicada...

25:01.984 --> 25:04.219
- What's with the ass, man?
- No, but mine was a whole different thing.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.154
- Yeah, how come you can say it? No, no...
- No, no, no, no.

25:06.187 --> 25:08.489
You can't say it
if I can't say it.

25:08.523 --> 25:10.891
You didn't wait for me to finish.
My thing wasn't sexual, right?

25:10.924 --> 25:14.160
- Leave my ass out of it.
- Okay. You get your...

25:14.794 --> 25:15.861
Butt.

25:15.895 --> 25:17.796
Okay, thanks.
You get your butt

25:17.829 --> 25:21.966
back to hunting Cicada 3301.

25:21.999 --> 25:23.200
You make contact.

25:23.233 --> 25:26.235
You get us close enough
to make some arrests,

25:26.269 --> 25:28.271
and we are gonna give you
a ton of money

25:28.304 --> 25:30.005
if you help us bring them down.

25:30.038 --> 25:31.707
Tax-free, of course.

25:31.740 --> 25:33.774
It's our little secret.

25:33.808 --> 25:36.977
How much for me
to deliver them?

25:37.010 --> 25:38.745
Okay, now we're
getting somewhere.

25:38.778 --> 25:40.513
- How much?
- Five mil.

25:40.546 --> 25:42.514
- Five mil?
- Yeah, yeah.

25:42.548 --> 25:44.483
How do I know
you're not gonna fuck me?

25:45.616 --> 25:47.585
- You don't.
- Yeah, you don't.

25:47.618 --> 25:48.819
You don't know that, actually.

25:48.852 --> 25:50.020
- You got to trust us.
- Yeah, you'll get that money.

25:50.053 --> 25:51.688
We're with the
government, you can trust us.

25:51.722 --> 25:53.155
It's five million.

25:57.926 --> 26:00.161
I'm your fucking man.

26:00.195 --> 26:02.229
I'm a company man
from here on out.

26:02.262 --> 26:03.864
I'm your ace.

26:03.897 --> 26:05.765
- You're gonna do it?
- Fuck yeah, man.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.000
- That's really nice of you.
- We're gonna...

26:07.033 --> 26:08.301
We're gonna make
a great fucking team.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.102
I think so, too, actually.

26:10.135 --> 26:11.570
Oh, my God. I didn't think
it was gonna be that easy.

26:11.603 --> 26:14.271
- That actually was kind of easy. Yeah.
- This was... This went well.

26:14.305 --> 26:15.673
- Yeah.
- Listen, man, while we're

26:15.706 --> 26:16.906
- on the subject...
- Yeah, man?

26:16.940 --> 26:20.776
I'm a little short on cash.
I'm on way to getting evicted.

26:20.809 --> 26:23.812
If you can front me some money
to kind of solidify the deal,

26:23.846 --> 26:27.148
you know,
this bond we made. Cool?

26:29.082 --> 26:31.084
Mm.

26:35.955 --> 26:37.255
Shit!

26:41.658 --> 26:42.960
Shit.

26:50.298 --> 26:51.600
Come on.

26:51.633 --> 26:53.934
Who is it?

26:53.968 --> 26:55.202
- No, I gotta go...
- No, no, no...

26:55.236 --> 26:57.037
No, no,
I got nothing for you.

26:57.070 --> 26:59.072
Please, I'm in trouble, just...
I just need your...

26:59.105 --> 27:01.306
You're so strong.

27:02.908 --> 27:05.243
You can't just break into
people's houses like that.

27:05.276 --> 27:08.645
Avi, I'm in deep shit,
real deep shit.

27:08.678 --> 27:10.814
Well, why am I
not surprised?

27:11.715 --> 27:13.149
Took some assholes Bitcoins.

27:13.182 --> 27:14.216
I know I shouldn't have,
but I did

27:14.250 --> 27:15.818
and it triggered something,
next thing you know

27:15.851 --> 27:16.985
I'm in a van with the NSA,

27:17.018 --> 27:18.753
they proposed
I take down Cicada,

27:18.787 --> 27:19.954
a secret society, or they...

27:19.988 --> 27:21.121
they're gonna throw me
in Guantanamo Bay.

27:21.155 --> 27:23.757
And then you
came straight here.

27:23.791 --> 27:26.025
Yeah, I got evicted.
I forgot to tell you.

27:26.059 --> 27:28.327
Secret societies,
Guantanamo Bay.

27:28.361 --> 27:30.062
Okay, I've heard enough,
Mr. Snuggles.

27:30.095 --> 27:32.130
I'm sorry, sweetie,
but it is time to go.

27:32.164 --> 27:33.798
This house is no longer safe.

27:33.831 --> 27:36.599
Avi. Avi, please,
you gotta help me disappear.

27:36.633 --> 27:38.068
And we want
nothing to do with this.

27:38.101 --> 27:39.869
Avi, I'll make this up to you,
I promise.

27:39.903 --> 27:42.371
I know I've been fucking up,
I'm a shitty friend.

27:42.404 --> 27:45.206
Tumbling out of vans, I'm fucking
using third graders' computers,

27:45.239 --> 27:48.176
I got fucking NSA dudes
riding my ass.

27:48.209 --> 27:49.810
Fucking up, man.
I know this.

27:49.843 --> 27:51.912
I know this is affecting you,
I'm sorry.

27:53.646 --> 27:56.815
You know that's the first time
you've ever apologized to me?

27:56.848 --> 27:58.850
You must really be in trouble.

28:00.818 --> 28:02.252
Yeah.

28:02.286 --> 28:04.787
All right,
we'll help you.

28:04.821 --> 28:07.356
I'm not gonna help you run away,
but we'll help you face this.

28:07.390 --> 28:08.957
<i>Pause.</i>

28:13.294 --> 28:14.929
What the hell is he doing?

28:14.962 --> 28:16.796
- Calm down, guys.
- Your Honor.

28:16.830 --> 28:18.398
Mike, just take it easy.
Calm down.

28:18.432 --> 28:19.533
Can we restrain the witness,
Your Honor?

28:19.567 --> 28:20.833
We will defend ourselves,
I'm telling you right now.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.067
- Where do you think you're going son?
- What is happening?

28:22.101 --> 28:24.369
- I come in peace, I'm just...
- Is he allowed to do that?

28:24.403 --> 28:25.336
- Take your seat, Mr. Black.
- I wanna just grab...

28:25.369 --> 28:26.771
- Your Honor...
- ...a quick piece of paper.

28:26.804 --> 28:29.005
- How you doing, sugar tits?
- Why are you giving him this evidence?

28:29.039 --> 28:30.073
- Fuck you, man.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:30.107 --> 28:31.174
Your Honor, please.

28:31.208 --> 28:32.708
- Come and fucking say that to my face!
- Order!

28:32.741 --> 28:33.709
He just called me
"sugar tits."

28:33.742 --> 28:35.144
Order, sit down.

28:35.177 --> 28:38.012
- Why am I getting in trouble?
- Why don't you tell him to sit down?

28:38.046 --> 28:39.214
- This is my court, sit down.
- Why the fuck am I getting in trouble?

28:39.247 --> 28:41.115
- He just...
- Order!

28:41.148 --> 28:43.317
Sit down, now, sit down.

28:43.350 --> 28:48.154
You are pressing your luck,
Connor. Get back to it.

28:48.187 --> 28:51.923
We have the big picture so
help us piece it all together,

28:51.957 --> 28:54.091
3301 and your colleagues.

28:54.125 --> 28:56.227
Think you got
the big picture, huh?

28:57.727 --> 28:59.662
Things are just
starting to get weird.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.630
What do you mean weird?

29:08.136 --> 29:10.070
Hey.

29:10.103 --> 29:12.239
Jump on that computer
in the corner?

29:13.139 --> 29:14.773
Where's your little friend?

29:14.807 --> 29:16.341
It's just me today.

29:16.374 --> 29:18.143
What's your deal with her?

29:18.176 --> 29:19.244
With who, with Sophia?

29:19.277 --> 29:20.911
No, no,
the other ten-year-old

29:20.944 --> 29:22.379
that you bring
on library dates.

29:22.413 --> 29:24.047
You just some kind of pedo?

29:25.748 --> 29:27.984
What, do you talk to everybody
who walks in here like this?

29:28.017 --> 29:30.819
Well, everybody who walks in
here is usually a pedo, so, yeah.

29:32.387 --> 29:36.890
She lives in my building,
mom's never around, works like 19 hours,

29:36.923 --> 29:37.824
at least I never saw her.

29:37.857 --> 29:40.993
No dad, met her
in a laundry room actually,

29:41.026 --> 29:44.463
told me, "Connor, you can't mix the
black socks with the white socks."

29:44.496 --> 29:46.465
Crazy, huh?
Told her if she needs anything,

29:46.498 --> 29:50.000
she can knock on my door,
and she has every Saturday.

29:50.033 --> 29:52.935
Come here,
hangout with the pedophiles.

29:56.172 --> 29:57.872
The hell do you want?

29:57.906 --> 29:59.874
I wanna jump on
the internet, thanks.

30:01.509 --> 30:03.977
Yeah, you're not allowed
to jerk off here.

30:04.011 --> 30:05.479
What?

30:05.512 --> 30:09.347
I'm just saying most people that
come here come for free porn.

30:09.382 --> 30:12.883
Oh. Well, I promise
I won't jerk off

30:12.917 --> 30:14.351
in front of
your pedophile friends.

30:16.319 --> 30:18.389
Let me get on a computer,
please.

30:19.289 --> 30:20.822
Please.

30:22.958 --> 30:24.393
- Fine.
- Thanks.

30:28.261 --> 30:32.065
So, how far did you get
in the hunt for Cicada, huh?

30:32.098 --> 30:33.699
Is that what
you're here to do?

30:34.033 --> 30:35.201
So?

30:35.234 --> 30:36.135
Hey, look, you know what, no,

30:36.168 --> 30:37.369
I don't want any trouble, okay?

30:37.403 --> 30:38.571
- What trouble?
- Just back up...

30:38.604 --> 30:39.737
- What trouble? There's no trouble.
- I don't know,

30:39.771 --> 30:42.206
you could be a fucking NSA agent
or some kind of saboteur,

30:42.239 --> 30:43.508
I don't fucking know.
Get out of the library.

30:43.541 --> 30:44.408
What NSA agent?

30:44.441 --> 30:48.110
Pop a lithium
and just chill, please?

30:48.144 --> 30:50.413
Just lock me in,
let me get to work.

30:50.446 --> 30:52.246
I'm not gonna bother you,
you won't bother me,

30:52.279 --> 30:55.115
the smartest person wins.
Deal?

31:00.453 --> 31:02.154
Don't even think of
asking me for help.

31:10.961 --> 31:12.395
You again.

31:12.429 --> 31:13.829
Good luck.

31:13.862 --> 31:15.264
<i>The good news was</i>

31:15.297 --> 31:17.865

What?

33:49.380 --> 33:53.483
You traumatized from a little
homeless self-love?

33:53.516 --> 33:55.452
It's the circle of life,
dude, get over it.

33:56.385 --> 33:57.586
Where does it go?

34:00.187 --> 34:01.556
The dark web link,
where does it go?

34:01.589 --> 34:03.424
Goes over there.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.191
Oh, okay.

34:05.224 --> 34:06.393
- Hey, can you...
- Hey, hey.

34:06.426 --> 34:08.226
- Use your own computer.
- Get off.

34:08.259 --> 34:11.364
I have to log in admin if you're
gonna get an onion router up.

34:19.135 --> 34:22.505
- GPS coordinates.
- Yeah.

34:22.538 --> 34:24.304
Let's see, will we.

34:27.476 --> 34:31.143
Paris, Tokyo, Los Angeles,
London, Boston.

34:31.177 --> 34:34.647
Holy shit. What's that,
like an hour away from here?

34:34.681 --> 34:36.348
Yeah. Okay, we don't close
for half an hour.

34:36.382 --> 34:37.416
No, no, no, no, no,
we had a deal.

34:37.449 --> 34:38.484
You have to wait for me,
please.

34:38.516 --> 34:39.650
- I'm not waiting for you.
- You don't understand

34:39.685 --> 34:40.451
how much I need this, okay?

34:40.485 --> 34:42.687
It means a lot
to me too, sorry.

34:42.719 --> 34:44.321
What?

34:45.322 --> 34:48.324
- Yeah, I'll wait.
- Cool.

34:48.357 --> 34:51.393
- I'll wait.
- Sit right there.

35:02.735 --> 35:05.102
So, if we're gonna be
friends with benefits,

35:05.136 --> 35:08.572
I mean, at least you could tell me
a little something about yourself.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.408
We're not
friends with benefits.

35:10.441 --> 35:11.575
We're not?

35:11.609 --> 35:14.511
No, I just didn't want you
to leave without me, obviously.

35:14.544 --> 35:16.311
You still liked it.

35:17.746 --> 35:19.947
I'm a lesbian, so...

35:21.349 --> 35:24.451
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:24.484 --> 35:25.318
Whatever, dude.

35:25.352 --> 35:27.554
Okay.
Who's the better kisser, me...

35:27.587 --> 35:29.020
Like every other girl.

35:29.053 --> 35:31.256
- Every other girl?
- Every single one.

35:31.289 --> 35:34.291
- Okay, what's your girlfriend's name?
- Never said I had a girlfriend.

35:34.325 --> 35:37.528
Oh, yeah?
That's interesting.

35:42.432 --> 35:44.999
Hey, dick.
What the fuck?

35:48.502 --> 35:49.670
What the...

35:51.505 --> 35:54.973
Get off my ass, buddy.
Fucking hate city drivers.

35:55.007 --> 35:57.342
Look, our street is right up
here, so just make the next right.

36:00.545 --> 36:02.747
You sure you got
the right coordinates?

36:02.780 --> 36:05.549
What? I'm just asking,
you know.

36:12.787 --> 36:16.088
Maybe this shit up here, right?

36:16.122 --> 36:19.393
- Maybe the art itself is a clue?
- Say what?

36:19.426 --> 36:22.395
I don't know maybe the art,
maybe that's the clue.

36:22.428 --> 36:24.296
I don't know
what any of this means.

36:31.234 --> 36:33.135
Maybe it's this stuff
on the wall,

36:33.168 --> 36:34.437
there's a lot of stuff here.

36:37.739 --> 36:40.040
It's like a needle in a
haystack.

36:56.118 --> 36:57.721
What next, genius?

36:57.754 --> 36:59.590
You're the expert.

36:59.623 --> 37:02.758
God, are you
always this grating?

37:02.792 --> 37:05.993
Fuck, you're like
living sandpaper, man.

37:07.127 --> 37:09.563
I don't mean to be.
It's just...

37:09.597 --> 37:12.365
Sometimes you just..

37:12.398 --> 37:15.033
- You get callous after years of...
- Found it.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.770
...abuse and neglect.

37:18.804 --> 37:21.339
- You sure?
- Yeah. Come look.

37:23.106 --> 37:25.308
- Let me see.
- Okay.

37:25.342 --> 37:26.810
Is it working?

37:28.142 --> 37:29.077
Nothing.

37:29.110 --> 37:30.813
Just try... just keep...
try it maybe horizontal.

37:30.846 --> 37:32.547
I did, just...

37:33.748 --> 37:35.148
- Fuck!
- Nope.

37:39.486 --> 37:41.554
- Uh, Gwen.
- What?

37:43.789 --> 37:46.023
Yup.

37:54.497 --> 37:56.331
- Pick it up.
- Okay, okay.

37:56.365 --> 37:57.766
Answer, answer, answer it.

37:57.799 --> 38:00.468
<i>You
have done well to come this far.</i>

38:00.501 --> 38:02.403
<i>We've sent you a picture.</i>

38:02.436 --> 38:06.273
<i>If you like what you see,
we should meet.</i>

38:10.174 --> 38:13.076
- Okay, well, that's fucking creepy.
- Let me see.

38:14.879 --> 38:16.580
Shit.

38:22.685 --> 38:24.819
- They're watching.
- What the fuck is that?

38:24.853 --> 38:27.556
Hey, come on,
get in the car.

38:27.589 --> 38:29.088
Ever heard
this happening before?

38:29.122 --> 38:31.124
No, I've never gotten
this far in the game.

38:31.157 --> 38:34.126
I don't know maybe it's Cicada
trying to track our progress?

38:34.159 --> 38:36.828
I don't fucking know,
I thought you would know.

38:36.862 --> 38:38.229
Where are we going?

38:40.130 --> 38:42.800
To get help with
the next piece of the puzzle.

38:42.833 --> 38:45.735
Now, let's look again
at Mantegna's Crucifixion.

38:45.769 --> 38:48.337
Well, notice the west
facing themes here, as well.

38:49.538 --> 38:50.673
Now we see here the viewer

38:50.706 --> 38:53.308
is set on the western end
of Golgotha.

38:53.341 --> 38:57.878
And as the hill rises away
from us and down the other side,

38:57.911 --> 39:01.781
it executes both the event
and our perspective active.

39:01.814 --> 39:04.583
Till next time. All right.

39:04.616 --> 39:08.452
Face west my soldiers.
Stay active.

39:09.687 --> 39:11.655
Professor, I've got
one question regarding...

39:11.689 --> 39:14.457
No. No, no, no, no, no,
you are not allowed to come here.

39:14.490 --> 39:18.159
Avi, this is Gwen.
Gwen, this is my best friend Avi.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.394
Hi.

39:20.428 --> 39:24.163
Avi Baginski, pleasure to make
your acquaintance, my dear.

39:24.196 --> 39:25.532
- Oh.
- My dear.

39:25.565 --> 39:27.367
- Okay.
- We're not friends.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.468
- Best friends.
- Okay. Anyway, um,

39:29.501 --> 39:30.502
it's nice to meet you, Avi.

39:30.536 --> 39:31.637
Connor mentioned
you could help us

39:31.670 --> 39:32.770
identify a piece of art.

39:32.804 --> 39:35.239
Well, Connor
says a lot of things.

39:35.273 --> 39:38.842
And unfortunately, I'm late for a
meeting, so you'll have to excuse me.

39:38.875 --> 39:40.443
Just... get him.

39:43.178 --> 39:44.546
Yup.

39:46.213 --> 39:47.349
Whoa.

39:48.282 --> 39:49.750
Knew you'd like it.

39:52.352 --> 39:53.820
Where did you find it?

39:53.853 --> 39:56.488
It's the next clue in the secret
society recruitment game.

39:56.521 --> 39:58.724
You too?

39:58.757 --> 40:01.392
Afraid so.

40:01.425 --> 40:03.760
These are actually all works
from William Blake.

40:03.793 --> 40:08.931
He was considered by many to be a
madman but by others a-a genius.

40:08.964 --> 40:13.735
But it looks like here someone's just
done a mash-up of his greatest works.

40:13.768 --> 40:16.303
I mean,
the hands are actually from

40:16.336 --> 40:18.204
two different prints
of the Nebuchadnezzar.

40:18.238 --> 40:19.272
King of Babylon?

40:19.306 --> 40:21.841
King's hands? Look like my
Grandma Connie's feet.

40:21.874 --> 40:24.843
Is that supposed to be
the compass of God or something?

40:25.377 --> 40:26.678
Urizen.

40:26.711 --> 40:28.779
It's actually one of Blake's
mythological creations

40:28.812 --> 40:32.882
and his proudest work.
I mean, he referenced him a lot.

40:32.915 --> 40:37.452
He was like a facet of God,
a creator, sometimes the devil.

40:37.486 --> 40:38.820
He warred against imagination,

40:38.854 --> 40:41.389
tried to set laws and rules
upon all creation.

40:41.422 --> 40:44.457
But eventually, he became
a slave to the very constraints

40:44.491 --> 40:46.292
he tried to force
upon the universe.

40:46.326 --> 40:49.261
I get it. This piece represents
everything, anti-science,

40:49.294 --> 40:50.896
anti-establishment,

40:50.929 --> 40:54.265
pretty much anti-everything
we know today, right?

40:54.298 --> 40:58.368
Yeah. I'm just wondering why
they used a mirror image though.

40:58.402 --> 40:59.802
They flipped it?

41:00.503 --> 41:02.203
Yeah.

41:02.238 --> 41:06.808
And the bottom piece
is both flipped and upside down.

41:06.841 --> 41:09.276
It's almost like
they made a Thelema star.

41:09.309 --> 41:11.345
A Masonic square and a compass.

41:11.378 --> 41:15.614
Yeah, but there's no G.
Every masonic symbol has a G.

41:15.647 --> 41:19.551
Yeah, but what I wanna know
is why the composition

41:19.584 --> 41:22.620
is drawing the viewer
to the nothing in the center.

41:22.653 --> 41:26.956
It's like the finger is pointing
to where the G would be.

41:26.990 --> 41:30.659
Is that... is that something?

41:31.026 --> 41:32.460
Where?

41:35.629 --> 41:36.897
Hold on.

41:38.532 --> 41:42.334
It's... it's a reverse
Roman numeral.

41:42.368 --> 41:44.636
Hey-hey, Avi,
flip the picture.

41:44.669 --> 41:45.737
Hold on.

41:45.770 --> 41:47.205
Flip the picture.

41:51.041 --> 41:54.911
- "MMMCCI."
- Got it.

41:54.944 --> 41:57.879
3301. That's it.

41:57.913 --> 42:01.248
That's them.
Maybe there's something...

42:10.889 --> 42:12.890
Can't make this shit up.

42:26.434 --> 42:27.469
Look at that.

42:27.502 --> 42:30.337
Yup.
They're all prime numbers.

42:30.370 --> 42:31.771
Except for...

42:36.675 --> 42:38.510
You guys need to stop now.

42:38.543 --> 42:40.277
They're representing the fall

42:40.311 --> 42:42.646
of man and nihilism,
transcendentalism.

42:42.680 --> 42:45.715
These are the type of things
that lead to mass genocide,

42:45.749 --> 42:47.549
bu-buckets
of poisonous Kool-Aid.

42:47.583 --> 42:50.886
If what they're saying
is what they believe, stop.

42:50.919 --> 42:52.520
Can't stop now.

43:23.877 --> 43:25.745
All right, Alpha Team,
we're going back to Avi's,

43:25.779 --> 43:27.413
we're gonna crack
this case open.

43:27.447 --> 43:28.714
Oh, no, we will not.

43:28.747 --> 43:29.615
- We will not.
- We'll order Chinese...

43:29.648 --> 43:31.016
I have nothing to do with this.
I'm sorry.

43:31.049 --> 43:32.016
But I am not getting murdered

43:32.049 --> 43:33.384
by some crazy ass cult leader.

43:33.417 --> 43:34.685
I have a meeting to attend.

43:34.719 --> 43:36.853
No offense to you, madam,
you're lovely.

43:36.887 --> 43:38.722
- Thank you.
- See you in a bit, Avi.

43:38.755 --> 43:41.724
No, you will not!
I don't know you!

43:43.125 --> 43:44.526
He's cute.

43:46.728 --> 43:48.695
Mmm...

43:51.131 --> 43:52.398
Boop.

43:52.431 --> 43:54.700
Now, I'm sorry
they're so sloppy.

43:54.734 --> 43:55.734
If I had known you were coming,

43:55.767 --> 43:58.069
I would've had the time
to make a proper lavender,

43:58.103 --> 44:00.070
but voila.

44:00.104 --> 44:04.774
- Mm. Mm, mm, mm.
- I'm trying not to eat sugar.

44:04.808 --> 44:06.609
Okay, okay.
Well, that's fine.

44:06.643 --> 44:09.778
You know, there's just
more for us. Right, buddy?

44:09.812 --> 44:12.079
- Okay, so...
- So, I've been doing some research

44:12.113 --> 44:13.614
- on this image.
- Mm-hm.

44:13.648 --> 44:16.483
At first, I thought
it was a moth. It's not.

44:16.516 --> 44:18.885
It's from
<i>De humani corporis fabrica.</i>

44:18.919 --> 44:21.887
This anatomy book
that was published in 1543.

44:21.921 --> 44:23.688
- What can I do to help?
- Hey, shh.

44:23.721 --> 44:25.890
- What?
- There's only one hand-colored volume

44:25.924 --> 44:28.091
left of
<i>De humani corporis fabrica.</i>

44:28.125 --> 44:29.726
- Where?
- Oh, so now you can talk?

44:29.760 --> 44:31.561
- What?
- I didn't know any...

44:31.594 --> 44:33.563
I thought, since I couldn't
talk, you couldn't talk.

44:33.596 --> 44:34.730
I don't speak cupcake.

44:34.764 --> 44:36.031
It's in the archives
of some museum

44:36.064 --> 44:37.532
a couple of hours away.

44:37.566 --> 44:39.800
All the clues seem to be
regionally tailored.

44:39.834 --> 44:43.703
What am I? What am I? What am I?
What is it asking for, huh?

44:43.736 --> 44:45.839
I don't know.
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

44:50.843 --> 44:52.109
Mm, I'm sorry.

44:54.579 --> 44:55.745
- That's it.
- What?

44:55.779 --> 44:57.447
Buttercream?

44:57.948 --> 44:59.548
The color.

44:59.582 --> 45:01.817
We need to know
the chemical composition

45:01.851 --> 45:04.586
of the pigment
that's used in this region.

45:05.453 --> 45:06.821
What am I?

45:06.855 --> 45:09.857
Why don't you
just call and ask?

45:09.890 --> 45:12.592
How many colors
in buttercream can you make?

45:12.625 --> 45:15.393
Millions.
I've done golds, mauves,

45:15.427 --> 45:18.563
I've done
this satiny periwinkle.

45:18.597 --> 45:20.030
It's exactly my point.

45:20.064 --> 45:22.600
We need to scrape off
some of the ink and analyze it.

45:22.633 --> 45:24.868
- They're testing our resolve.
- Yeah.

45:24.901 --> 45:26.603
Seeing what we're made of.

45:26.636 --> 45:28.136
I know what we're made of.

45:28.171 --> 45:30.505
We need your professor card.
You're gonna get us in.

45:30.539 --> 45:31.372
No, no, no, no.
No way. No way.

45:31.405 --> 45:33.007
Oh, no, no,
it's not that bad, Avi.

45:33.040 --> 45:34.709
No, no, no, no, no.
You guys ain't getting me in trouble.

45:34.742 --> 45:35.909
- It's not a big deal.
- No!

45:35.942 --> 45:36.710
Avi, we're in and out.

45:36.743 --> 45:37.744
Not putting my job
on the line,

45:37.777 --> 45:40.446
you can just go straight to hell.
Not happening.

45:43.715 --> 45:46.484
- Just try to fit in.
- I've never done this before.

45:48.085 --> 45:49.987
No, no, no, no.
What do I do?

45:50.787 --> 45:52.588
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:54.523 --> 45:56.057
Um...

45:56.091 --> 45:58.693
- Mr. Professor.
- Boston.

45:58.727 --> 45:59.960
Boston. Wow.

45:59.994 --> 46:03.529
Uh, my students and I,
we were just hoping we could have

46:03.563 --> 46:07.100
a little peek
at your rare book archives.

46:07.133 --> 46:10.203
- Uh, I don't know.
- Please. Please.

46:10.236 --> 46:12.470
- Come on, come on, come on.
- You're so cute.

46:12.503 --> 46:14.872
Look, see the thing is,
I just need a little look

46:14.906 --> 46:17.174
because I'm actually
publishing a book.

46:17.208 --> 46:19.176
- Publish? You?
- Yes. Yes!

46:20.743 --> 46:22.745
Oh, my God!

46:22.778 --> 46:25.214
I know! I'm so excited!

46:25.247 --> 46:28.815
So... about those archives?

46:28.849 --> 46:30.617
Oh, yeah.

46:31.550 --> 46:32.885
I wish I could.

46:32.919 --> 46:35.787
But, unfortunately, you would need
permission from the archive lady

46:35.820 --> 46:37.856
and she isn't here
on Sundays.

46:37.889 --> 46:39.456
I'm-I'm so sorry. Please.

46:39.490 --> 46:41.926
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus, watch your shit, lady!

46:41.959 --> 46:43.626
Whoa! Don't call me lady.

46:43.660 --> 46:46.062
Whoa, whoa, guys, please, please, please.
One moment, please?

46:46.095 --> 46:48.931
Yeah. Can you please
take care of your students?

46:50.565 --> 46:52.667
Talk to you for a minute.
What the hell, man?

46:52.700 --> 46:53.601
All you have to do
is sweet talk the guy.

46:53.634 --> 46:56.670
I don't do that.
I've never done this before.

46:56.703 --> 46:59.605
- You stole that?
- Hey. Keep your voice down.

47:00.673 --> 47:01.874
This is perfect.

47:01.907 --> 47:03.474
While Connor and I
break into the archives,

47:03.508 --> 47:04.676
you go distract him.

47:04.709 --> 47:06.744
How am I
supposed to distract him?

47:07.711 --> 47:08.979
Flirt.

47:09.012 --> 47:10.681
Flirt... what?

47:10.714 --> 47:11.981
- Yup.
- Yes.

47:16.718 --> 47:18.687
I-I wouldn't even know
where to start.

47:18.720 --> 47:20.087
I-I, you know,
I've never done this before.

47:20.121 --> 47:21.156
Sure, I thought about it,

47:21.189 --> 47:22.756
but I-I don't swing both ways.

47:22.790 --> 47:24.924
I do. It's pretty great.

47:24.958 --> 47:26.559
Oh, so you
did love kissing me?

47:26.592 --> 47:28.794
- No. No, I didn't.
- You guys kissed?

47:28.827 --> 47:30.495
- If you wanna call it that.
- She loved it.

47:30.529 --> 47:31.796
- She didn't love it.
- She loved it.

47:31.829 --> 47:33.198
- Disgusting.
- Mm-mm.

47:33.231 --> 47:34.465
Can I have a kiss?

47:35.865 --> 47:37.968
I mean,
if you're giving them out.

47:38.835 --> 47:41.271
Sure, you can get a kiss.

47:41.304 --> 47:44.539
You can get a kiss
right over there.

47:44.572 --> 47:46.175
Go get him.

47:46.208 --> 47:48.709
- Hi. You're back.
- Hi.

47:48.742 --> 47:51.610
I couldn't stay away.

47:51.644 --> 47:52.912
Come on.

47:55.115 --> 47:57.816
The old clumsy pickpocket
routine, huh?

47:57.849 --> 48:00.784
- Not bad for a librarian.
- Yeah, well, at least I did something.

48:00.818 --> 48:02.720
Even if you had thought of it,
which you didn't,

48:02.753 --> 48:05.222
you probably would've been too
chicken shit to go through with it.

48:06.856 --> 48:08.991
I actually would beg to differ.

48:09.024 --> 48:10.525
What'd you steal?

48:11.127 --> 48:12.727
Your heart.

48:15.562 --> 48:17.063
Oh, shit.

48:20.799 --> 48:21.934
Damn.

48:31.674 --> 48:34.111
Only hope now is that clerk
is sucking on Avi...

48:36.278 --> 48:38.646
Yeah... let's hope.

48:42.217 --> 48:45.319
Okay. Start looking
over there or something.

48:45.352 --> 48:47.552
Try not to break anything.

49:00.729 --> 49:02.765
Hmm. Damn.

49:02.798 --> 49:05.134
Cherry oak.

49:05.167 --> 49:07.268
Focus for like 30 seconds,
please.

49:12.038 --> 49:15.274
There's no friend
as loyal as a book.

49:15.307 --> 49:16.941
I hear you talking.

49:16.975 --> 49:19.710
That's not me.
That's Hemingway.

49:32.019 --> 49:33.621
Hello?

49:35.989 --> 49:37.791
Is anybody there?

49:42.195 --> 49:46.198
No one is authorized
to be in this location.

49:47.298 --> 49:50.134
- Come on, librarian.
- Fuck.

49:51.834 --> 49:52.835
Found it.

49:52.868 --> 49:54.003
Oh, shit.

49:55.204 --> 49:56.638
Shh.

49:57.306 --> 49:58.773
Calm down.

49:58.807 --> 50:01.809
Careful. You know
how old this thing is?

50:01.842 --> 50:04.644
You're ripping through it
like it's a fucking magazine.

50:11.982 --> 50:14.386
Gentle. Check this one.
Check this one.

50:14.419 --> 50:16.087
- You sure that's it?
- Yes.

50:16.120 --> 50:17.954
- You sure?
- Yes. Wait...

50:17.987 --> 50:19.054
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

50:19.089 --> 50:19.888
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm borrowing it.

50:19.922 --> 50:21.723
- You're borrowing...?
- Shh, shh-

50:21.757 --> 50:22.925
Hey!

50:22.958 --> 50:25.026
- Sorry, just got a little lost.
- Die, bitch!

50:25.059 --> 50:27.861
- Oh, my God! Come on.
- Shit!

50:35.667 --> 50:36.968
Time to go, lover boy!

50:37.001 --> 50:39.903
- I'm coming, I'm coming!
- What the hell did you guys do?!

50:39.937 --> 50:41.106
Asshole!

50:41.139 --> 50:43.107
I was never
good enough for you.

50:45.242 --> 50:46.343
- What was that?
- Oh, man.

50:46.376 --> 50:49.744
You tore that... Oh, you're
wiping your face with it?

50:49.778 --> 50:51.645
The face is fine.
Don't worry about it.

50:51.679 --> 50:53.181
- Well, you deserve it!
- Okay, could you two

50:53.215 --> 50:54.349
figure this out in marriage
counseling?

50:54.382 --> 50:56.983
We cannot stay here! Fuck!

50:57.016 --> 51:00.153
- Oh, shit.
- Going to counseling,

51:00.186 --> 51:01.653
I'm not going anywhere
with you guys ever again.

51:01.687 --> 51:05.357
- Oh, God, Avi, just calm down, please.
- Don't tell me to calm down!

51:05.390 --> 51:07.991
I mean, you might be okay living your
life like some type of wrecking ball,

51:08.024 --> 51:10.794
but some of us
have things to lose!

51:10.827 --> 51:11.994
I might lose my job over this!

51:12.027 --> 51:13.996
My jilted lover,
he knows my address,

51:14.029 --> 51:15.197
he knows about my cat.

51:15.231 --> 51:16.865
What if he
kidnaps Mr. Snuggles?!

51:16.898 --> 51:18.267
- No.
- No one's getting kidnapped.

51:18.300 --> 51:20.401
Stop being ridiculous.

51:20.435 --> 51:22.936
It's just a piece of paper.
We'll put it back tomorrow.

51:22.970 --> 51:25.938
If you don't wanna do it,
me and Gwen will do it.

51:25.972 --> 51:28.039
It will be fine.

51:28.074 --> 51:29.342
No big deal.

51:30.409 --> 51:32.210
Yeah, huh?

51:36.113 --> 51:37.747
Hello?

51:40.883 --> 51:42.017
Avi...

52:05.868 --> 52:07.436
What the fuck is going on?

52:13.208 --> 52:15.742
- Guys?
- What?

52:15.775 --> 52:17.077
One second.

52:17.977 --> 52:19.179
I can't see shit.

52:19.212 --> 52:20.779
Shh. Don't yell!

52:20.812 --> 52:23.315
Shut the fuck up.

52:23.348 --> 52:24.849
Avi, calm down.
We've been through worse.

52:24.882 --> 52:26.751
Who the fuck were they?

52:26.784 --> 52:29.920
- Guys, please calm down.
- Oh, you want me to fucking calm down?

52:29.953 --> 52:31.954
In these situations,
you go with the flow.

52:31.987 --> 52:34.324
With the flow? Since when are
you the zen fucking master?

52:34.357 --> 52:35.524
I don't wanna die here.

52:35.558 --> 52:37.859
No one's gonna fucking die.
Avi, just shut the fuck up.

52:37.892 --> 52:41.095
- Seriously, shut the fuck up.
- Okay?

52:42.763 --> 52:44.231
It might be not that bad.

52:44.264 --> 52:45.798
Might be not that bad.
Shh. Quiet.

52:56.940 --> 52:58.209
What the fuck?

52:58.242 --> 52:59.775
Shit.

53:12.818 --> 53:15.820
Come on, man.
Don't do this.

53:19.157 --> 53:20.358
Oh, shit!

53:20.391 --> 53:22.427
Please, I'm a great cat-dad!

53:22.460 --> 53:24.760
They love me so much,
they're gonna miss me.

53:24.794 --> 53:26.129
They're gonna miss me,

53:26.163 --> 53:28.130
they're gonna miss me...
Please...

53:42.475 --> 53:44.543
What the fuck is happening?

53:49.413 --> 53:52.048
- Are you kidding me?
- Not again.

53:52.082 --> 53:55.783
Your honor...
that-that never happened.

53:55.817 --> 54:00.321
We weren't dressed like...
sexy gun babies.

54:00.355 --> 54:02.989
I mean,
that's not how I remember it.

54:03.023 --> 54:08.893
Mr. Black, were the NSA agents
dressed in baby costumes or not?

54:08.927 --> 54:12.430
Killer Rugrats, Your Honor.
Killer Rugrats!

54:12.464 --> 54:13.998
We're done here.

54:14.032 --> 54:16.166
Okay, your honor,
fine, fine, fine, fine.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.800
They weren't dressed up
like ugly, baby cosplays.

54:17.834 --> 54:19.535
I would not be ugly,
as a baby.

54:19.569 --> 54:22.038
Okay, Carver...
Nor did we open fire, Your Honor.

54:22.071 --> 54:23.004
Or have diapers.

54:23.038 --> 54:24.839
We followed
procedure to the letter.

54:24.872 --> 54:26.108
It's all in the report.

54:26.141 --> 54:28.142
I still contend
things could've gone

54:28.175 --> 54:29.510
in an entirely different
direction

54:29.543 --> 54:32.145
if Mr. GI Joe
wouldn't have intervened.

54:32.178 --> 54:33.113
Yeah, damn straight.

54:33.146 --> 54:35.180
You'd be in a cardboard box
six feet under

54:35.214 --> 54:36.181
if we hadn't intervened.

54:36.215 --> 54:37.116
That's enough.

54:37.149 --> 54:38.083
- That's not true.
- It's true.

54:38.117 --> 54:40.917
We're all dressed up here
because of you.

54:40.951 --> 54:42.253
I'm dressed nicer.

54:43.253 --> 54:44.421
Right.

54:44.454 --> 54:48.424
The deer people
were other Cicada hopefuls?

54:48.457 --> 54:49.525
Yeah.

54:49.558 --> 54:50.426
<i>They wanted to steal the page</i>

54:50.459 --> 54:52.926
<i>we took from
the tome and bury us.</i>

54:57.031 --> 54:58.299
That's ours.

55:00.033 --> 55:03.101
I'm afraid we're gonna have to
collect this for evidence, miss.

55:03.135 --> 55:05.470
We'll take your accounts
and get you on your way soon.

55:07.638 --> 55:11.474
Hey, Sully.
Give me a hard drive. Bang, bang!

55:11.508 --> 55:13.209
What the fuck are you doing?

55:13.243 --> 55:14.511
Fuck...
take that fucking thing off!

55:14.544 --> 55:16.612
It's... It's fucking evidence,
you idiot.

55:16.645 --> 55:19.147
- Okay.
- Put it down! What the fuck?

55:19.180 --> 55:21.115
- Sorry. Cool.
- No, but it's fuckin'...

55:21.149 --> 55:23.016
it's every single day!

55:23.050 --> 55:27.153
All right. Deadly serious...
from here on out.

55:27.186 --> 55:28.454
The fuck you looking at?

55:31.523 --> 55:33.491
You seen that...
you seen this before?

55:33.525 --> 55:34.359
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

55:34.392 --> 55:36.493
- Looks like a brain vagina.
- Yeah.

55:39.996 --> 55:41.364
Fucking idiot.

55:50.271 --> 55:52.971
<i>I never meant for
things to turn out the way they did.</i>

55:54.007 --> 55:54.972
You know, Gwen and Avi

55:55.007 --> 55:56.141
wanted nothing to do with me

55:56.175 --> 55:57.576
and Cicada after that.

55:58.477 --> 55:59.910
I was on my own.

55:59.943 --> 56:02.213
Was that the last piece
of the puzzle?

56:02.246 --> 56:05.582
NSA ran a lab on the
page, it turned out to be cinnabar.

56:05.615 --> 56:08.384
Stuff cost a fortune
in the 16th Century.

56:08.417 --> 56:10.353
Only suitable for kings.

56:10.386 --> 56:13.388
The word was a key to unlock
another piece of the puzzle.

56:13.421 --> 56:14.589
It's all it was.

56:14.622 --> 56:15.955
And what was that?

56:21.994 --> 56:23.894
<i>It was a message that said,</i>

56:23.928 --> 56:27.631
<i>"In order to see the light
you must shine the dark."</i>

56:29.700 --> 56:32.635
<i>I spent days
trying to decipher the text.</i>

56:35.104 --> 56:38.407
<i>But then I realized there was
a different kind of test.</i>

56:40.341 --> 56:43.276
<i>They wanted to see
what I was capable of.</i>

56:47.079 --> 56:49.948
<i>You're a barbarian. Savage.</i>

57:09.430 --> 57:14.100
<i>It took five hours for the lights
to come back in some parts of the city.</i>

57:14.134 --> 57:17.136
<i>Looting tore through
the area almost instantly.</i>

57:18.437 --> 57:21.038
<i>The scales fell off my eyes.</i>

57:21.072 --> 57:24.074
<i>They were no more
enlightened than dogs.</i>

57:24.107 --> 57:26.576
<i>I guess I couldn't blame them.</i>

57:26.610 --> 57:29.111
<i>I mean, who's the animal?</i>

57:29.145 --> 57:30.944
<i>The dog in the cage</i>

57:30.979 --> 57:34.015
<i>or the one
who keeps them locked up?</i>

57:34.048 --> 57:37.418
<i>It wasn't about
shutting down the power.</i>

57:37.451 --> 57:40.987
<i>We're just one light switch away
from tearing each other apart.</i>

58:23.185 --> 58:24.319
All right.

58:28.389 --> 58:31.691
You got me chasing puzzles,
show yourself!

58:32.659 --> 58:34.360
Fuck you!

58:39.263 --> 58:41.065
Think you're so great.

58:42.200 --> 58:43.733
So enlightened.

58:47.703 --> 58:49.171
Fuck you!

58:51.406 --> 58:55.409
Fucking nobody...
like everybody else,

58:55.442 --> 58:57.478
an emperor with no clothes.

01:00:52.864 --> 01:00:54.399
- Uh-uh!
- Hey, Avi, let me in.

01:00:54.431 --> 01:00:55.532
- No, no!
- Pl... Avi.

01:00:55.566 --> 01:00:57.868
No. No means no!

01:00:57.901 --> 01:01:00.169
- Avi, can we just talk? Come on.
- Gwen, help!

01:01:00.202 --> 01:01:02.171
- Wait, Gwen's here?
- Yeah, she is.

01:01:02.204 --> 01:01:04.139
And she's gonna be
my new best friend.

01:01:04.172 --> 01:01:07.241
- Let's just talk.
- No. Nothing to say to you.

01:01:07.274 --> 01:01:09.577
Is this really what
you're like when you date, too?

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:12.579
No, he's being ridiculous.
Would you help me here?

01:01:12.612 --> 01:01:15.814
Hmm, I don't know. How do we know
you're not having deer or rabbit...?

01:01:15.847 --> 01:01:16.916
Dog people.

01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:18.616
- That would be scary.
- That would be scary, yeah.

01:01:18.649 --> 01:01:19.850
How do we know you don't
have any dog people

01:01:19.884 --> 01:01:22.320
following you
trying to fucking kill us?

01:01:22.353 --> 01:01:24.287
That's not my fault.

01:01:24.321 --> 01:01:26.722
- Nice.
- Can we just be adults about this?

01:01:28.691 --> 01:01:31.659
What is this?

01:01:31.693 --> 01:01:32.794
None of your beeswax.

01:01:32.827 --> 01:01:37.564
Yeah, be adults about it.
If you can.

01:01:37.598 --> 01:01:40.199
Avi told me that he would
teach me how to play chess.

01:01:40.232 --> 01:01:41.701
Mm-hm.

01:01:41.734 --> 01:01:45.770
No, no, don't you dare.
Don't, don't... just don't do it.

01:01:45.804 --> 01:01:50.140
King side castle,
bishop A4, queen...

01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:54.409
D3. You're good.

01:01:54.443 --> 01:01:57.279
- You are not a nice person.
- No, he's not.

01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:00.514
Avi, can I talk to you
for a second?

01:02:00.548 --> 01:02:02.749
No. Anything you
have to say to me,

01:02:02.782 --> 01:02:04.184
you can say
in front of my new friend.

01:02:04.217 --> 01:02:07.720
We don't keep any secrets.
Do we?

01:02:07.753 --> 01:02:08.787
No. Hm.

01:02:08.821 --> 01:02:13.424
All right.
Well, I came to say goodbye.

01:02:13.458 --> 01:02:15.559
You broke in
just to say goodbye?

01:02:15.592 --> 01:02:16.827
You couldn't text?

01:02:18.295 --> 01:02:22.330
I got in... to Cicada.

01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:23.698
At least to their party.

01:02:23.732 --> 01:02:26.201
Hold on a second.

01:02:26.234 --> 01:02:28.736
You got in
and you weren't gonna tell me?

01:02:28.769 --> 01:02:30.703
After everything
that you put us through?

01:02:30.737 --> 01:02:32.271
You wanna come to England
and watch me

01:02:32.305 --> 01:02:33.840
choke some bitch out,
be my guest.

01:02:33.873 --> 01:02:35.574
Wait, how do you know
it's just one?

01:02:35.607 --> 01:02:37.876
I don't know if it's just one.
Avi, you were right.

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:40.711
These people need to be stopped.
I'm gonna end this.

01:02:41.379 --> 01:02:42.312
What happened?

01:02:42.345 --> 01:02:44.581
Yeah, there's something
you're hiding from us.

01:02:54.588 --> 01:02:55.622
I'm going.

01:02:55.656 --> 01:02:56.790
You're not invited.

01:02:56.823 --> 01:03:01.360
Um, technically,
she was invited.

01:03:01.394 --> 01:03:02.460
I'm coming, too.

01:03:02.494 --> 01:03:04.596
You're not gonna leave me behind
like some fuddy duddy

01:03:04.629 --> 01:03:07.231
while you guys go off
on some epic spy adventure.

01:03:07.264 --> 01:03:12.201
Avi... everyone who
finished this game disappeared.

01:03:12.235 --> 01:03:15.771
And they wanted in, okay?

01:03:15.804 --> 01:03:17.907
Uh, I-I-I can't...
I can't risk you getting hurt.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.607
These people
are far too powerful.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.742
You heard the lady.
Send the invitation.

01:03:22.776 --> 01:03:25.812
Time for us to kick
some secret insect booty.

01:03:26.578 --> 01:03:29.214
All right.

01:03:29.248 --> 01:03:31.917
<i>We decided if we're
gonna go to Oz to unmask the wizard,</i>

01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:33.618
<i>it'd be better
to work as a team.</i>

01:03:33.651 --> 01:03:35.819
<i>So Avi bought the tickets
for the flight,</i>

01:03:35.852 --> 01:03:40.189
<i>Gwen got the spy gear,
my job was to rent the tuxes.</i>

01:03:40.823 --> 01:03:43.324
Yeah. I look dumb.

01:03:43.358 --> 01:03:46.326
<i>Together,
we would be unstoppable.</i>

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:03.840
Hey, Avi.
You got your earpiece?

01:04:03.874 --> 01:04:06.241
- Secret Agent Avi, to the rescue!
- Jesus!

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:08.477
- Oh, my God. Really?
- Hey, man. Come on.

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:10.478
I'm sorry,
I've never been a spy.

01:04:12.447 --> 01:04:14.715
- Oh, my heart is racing, guys.
- Yeah.

01:04:14.748 --> 01:04:17.250
- Well, what's our safe word gonna be?
- Safe word?

01:04:17.284 --> 01:04:20.921
Yeah, you know, in case things go
haywire, we had to abort mission.

01:04:20.954 --> 01:04:22.754
Every great spy movie
has one.

01:04:22.787 --> 01:04:25.590
It's not a BDSM
sex orgy party, okay?

01:04:25.623 --> 01:04:26.490
It's a black-tie affair.

01:04:26.523 --> 01:04:28.525
We don't need
a safe word, password, guys.

01:04:28.559 --> 01:04:30.727
- Stop.
- Okay, Mr. Optimistic Pants.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.529
But just in case,
I say we make it Mr. Snuggles.

01:04:34.563 --> 01:04:37.499
- I'm not saying Mr. Snuggles.
- No. Don't say Mr. Snuggles.

01:04:37.532 --> 01:04:39.366
- Bad idea.
- Okay.

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.368
- Okay, shall we?
- Yup.

01:04:41.402 --> 01:04:43.536
Mask up, y'all.

01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:45.672
What the fuck is on your face?

01:04:45.705 --> 01:04:47.773
It's-it's a masquerade party.

01:04:47.806 --> 01:04:49.976
- The fuck...
- Did you not read the invitations?

01:04:50.009 --> 01:04:51.843
Am I the only one
who read the invitations?

01:04:51.877 --> 01:04:53.946
Oh, my God. I...

01:04:59.715 --> 01:05:00.917
ID's...

01:05:05.453 --> 01:05:09.423
I'm gonna lose line of sight
in 60 seconds or less. Over.

01:05:10.091 --> 01:05:11.357
All right. Go ahead.

01:05:17.763 --> 01:05:19.263
C'mon in.

01:05:26.401 --> 01:05:27.503
You're not on the list.

01:05:27.536 --> 01:05:28.637
Uh...

01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:33.474
Uh, are-are you sure?
My-my friends are on the list.

01:05:33.508 --> 01:05:35.342
You're not on the list.

01:05:35.375 --> 01:05:36.610
Well... Hey, do you mind?

01:05:36.643 --> 01:05:38.310
I'm just gonna use
the bathroom real quick...

01:05:38.344 --> 01:05:42.048
Don't. No. Please.

01:05:42.082 --> 01:05:43.849
Okay. There's no issue,
there's no issue.

01:05:43.883 --> 01:05:45.985
There's no issue,
I-I'll be on my way.

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:48.685
Please. Excuse me.

01:05:49.453 --> 01:05:51.454
You're very strong.

01:06:38.389 --> 01:06:40.025
It's pretty great, huh?

01:06:40.058 --> 01:06:42.358
- Say again?
- This is pretty great, huh?

01:06:42.392 --> 01:06:43.861
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

01:06:43.894 --> 01:06:47.462
I mean, after what we had
to go through to make it here,

01:06:47.496 --> 01:06:49.765
the least they could do
is throw us a crazy party, eh?

01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:51.766
Hey! Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:06:53.701 --> 01:06:56.003
I mean, I wouldn't expect
anything less from Cicada, huh.

01:06:56.037 --> 01:06:57.404
I'm Patrick.

01:06:58.637 --> 01:07:00.006
Hey, Connor.

01:07:12.682 --> 01:07:14.917
Ow! Ow, ow.

01:07:17.854 --> 01:07:20.121
Any idea what we're
supposed to be doing here?

01:07:20.155 --> 01:07:21.655
Nope.

01:07:21.689 --> 01:07:25.525
But if it's 3301
we're talking about,

01:07:25.558 --> 01:07:27.861
I guess anything's possible.

01:07:29.028 --> 01:07:30.661
Everything's a test, huh.

01:07:31.129 --> 01:07:32.430
Yeah.

01:07:33.999 --> 01:07:37.467
I'm gonna... I'm gonna freshen up.
I'll see ya around, Connor.

01:07:39.435 --> 01:07:42.503
Hmm.
Yeah, everything's a test, huh?

01:07:56.715 --> 01:07:58.917
Anyone else seeing holograms?

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:01.719
Holograms? No!
What-what the hell are you talking...

01:08:01.752 --> 01:08:02.887
No, I don't see holograms.

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.955
<i>Why are you so out of breath?</i>

01:08:04.989 --> 01:08:06.555
Oh, no reason, really, I...

01:08:06.588 --> 01:08:07.857
I'm just having
a lovely evening,

01:08:07.891 --> 01:08:10.458
<i>smelling flowers,
looking at the constellations.</i>

01:08:10.491 --> 01:08:11.592
You didn't get in?

01:08:11.626 --> 01:08:13.761
Negative. I am outside.

01:08:13.794 --> 01:08:15.129
- Outside?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:08:15.162 --> 01:08:16.831
<i>Apparently,
they don't like pirates</i>

01:08:16.863 --> 01:08:18.631
crashing their black-tie
function, Connor.

01:08:18.663 --> 01:08:21.500
Avi, it's not my fault
you can't fit in a tuxedo.

01:08:21.533 --> 01:08:24.502
Hey. I'm gonna go try
and find him and sneak him in.

01:08:24.535 --> 01:08:25.304
No, no,
I need you to stay here.

01:08:25.337 --> 01:08:26.970
There's a little more
to this party

01:08:27.005 --> 01:08:29.640
than just rabbits
and boys in dog outfits.

01:08:29.673 --> 01:08:31.439
There's no knowing how long
this party is gonna go.

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:32.541
I feel bad
leaving him out there.

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:33.643
Look, I can't have you
locked outside

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:34.743
and slowing me down.

01:08:35.710 --> 01:08:38.444
I'm going. Just wait here.

01:08:46.886 --> 01:08:49.488
Mock on, mock on.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.657
Mock on, mock on.

01:08:52.689 --> 01:08:55.126
Mock on.

01:08:55.158 --> 01:09:00.095
Mock on, mock on,
Voltaire, Rousseau.

01:09:00.130 --> 01:09:03.698
You blow your sand
against the wind,

01:09:03.731 --> 01:09:07.701
and the wind
blows it back again.

01:09:07.734 --> 01:09:14.206
And every sand becomes a gem
reflected in the beams Divine.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:20.611
Blown back, they blind...
the mocking eye.

01:09:27.984 --> 01:09:30.218
You've done well
to come this far, Connor.

01:09:37.024 --> 01:09:39.625
- For everything that lives...
- Is holy.

01:10:10.949 --> 01:10:12.284
Good luck.

01:10:20.589 --> 01:10:22.858
Ah, shit!

01:10:22.891 --> 01:10:26.928
Lend me your mind
and feast on the prize.

01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:31.865
Uh...

01:10:31.898 --> 01:10:34.033
That's an interesting test.

01:10:34.066 --> 01:10:39.004
Uh, a painting of a skeleton
smoking a cigarette.

01:10:39.037 --> 01:10:40.571
Avi?

01:10:40.604 --> 01:10:41.705
<i>That's easy. That's easy.</i>

01:10:41.739 --> 01:10:42.806
Head of a Skeleton

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.008
With a Burning Cigarette.

01:10:44.041 --> 01:10:46.042
- Cigarette?
- Vincent Van...

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:49.178
- Would you like a cigarette?
- ...Gogh.

01:10:49.212 --> 01:10:53.081
- I know what this is. Uh...
- Van Gogh.

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:55.216
Head of a Skeleton
With a Burning Cigarette.

01:11:33.778 --> 01:11:36.981
- I love this place.
- I love your flavors. It's hilarious.

01:11:58.096 --> 01:11:59.998
What the fuck?

01:12:11.139 --> 01:12:14.008
Connor? Gwen?

01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:16.643
- Gwen?
- Who are you talking to?

01:12:16.676 --> 01:12:18.078
Mr. Snuggles.

01:12:19.678 --> 01:12:20.814
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:12:20.847 --> 01:12:23.382
He doesn't like...
he doesn't like talking to new people.

01:12:23.415 --> 01:12:27.018
- You're so funny.
- What can I say?

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:29.053
<i>Hey, did you say Mr. Snuggles?</i>

01:12:29.087 --> 01:12:32.255
- Oh, this is not happening.
- <i>Hey, what was that?</i>

01:12:32.289 --> 01:12:34.323
Did you say Mr. Snuggles,
or what?

01:12:34.356 --> 01:12:37.759
<i>Guys? Hey, Gwen, are you there?</i>

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:41.628
- Um...
- Okay.

01:12:54.071 --> 01:12:55.372
So predictable.

01:12:58.308 --> 01:13:04.046
Politicians, global bankers,
all chasing the same thing.

01:13:05.414 --> 01:13:06.713
Power?

01:13:06.747 --> 01:13:10.083
Punishment.

01:13:15.321 --> 01:13:18.722
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Sorry. My bad.

01:13:19.791 --> 01:13:21.724
No holograms in here.

01:13:22.993 --> 01:13:29.965
Only freethinkers, poets,
politicians, and kings.

01:13:33.101 --> 01:13:36.303
The only decision
you have to make

01:13:36.337 --> 01:13:40.240
is if your drug of choice
is pain...

01:13:43.976 --> 01:13:45.277
or pleasure.

01:13:49.413 --> 01:13:53.350
Good evening,
my most esteemed friends!

01:13:53.383 --> 01:13:58.887
Hmm. Phillip Dubois,
Cicada 3301 in the flesh.

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:03.056
Tonight,
we celebrate both the initiated

01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:09.028
and the unreformed with our own
odd bits of magical wisdom...

01:14:10.462 --> 01:14:14.999
that we may be reminded
that it is not the price

01:14:15.032 --> 01:14:17.034
of our professions we seek,

01:14:17.067 --> 01:14:23.172
but rather the crucible
of our liberated consciousness.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:32.913
Eat, drink, dance,
free your minds.

01:14:32.946 --> 01:14:39.050
For the enlightened,
there can be no denial of self, yes?

01:14:40.818 --> 01:14:42.119
Bon appétit.

01:14:44.221 --> 01:14:45.755
You heard the man.

01:14:48.224 --> 01:14:50.091
Hey, Phillip.

01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:20.315
- Hey, you see where that guy...
- Get your hands off me.

01:15:20.348 --> 01:15:21.782
- Hey.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:15:21.815 --> 01:15:25.085
I-I know you. Connor.
How are you, friend?

01:15:25.118 --> 01:15:27.086
These women
sure are ripe, eh?

01:15:27.119 --> 01:15:29.522
- Hey, man. Come here. Come here.
- I'm good, man.

01:15:34.058 --> 01:15:35.759
Shh...

01:16:02.246 --> 01:16:04.147
Hey.
What are you doing here?

01:16:04.181 --> 01:16:08.918
Um... I was just...
I was looking for the bathroom.

01:16:11.453 --> 01:16:12.887
Mr. Snuggles.

01:16:14.855 --> 01:16:16.957
Mr. fucking Snuggles.

01:16:16.991 --> 01:16:20.393
Hey, I think the head honcho
of Cicada's here somewhere,

01:16:20.426 --> 01:16:22.127
so I'm gonna have a look around.

01:16:23.462 --> 01:16:24.963
Gwen?

01:16:26.897 --> 01:16:28.199
Avi?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.267
Awesome.

01:16:32.869 --> 01:16:34.803
I don't...
Uh, just one second.

01:16:34.837 --> 01:16:36.438
Guys, where are you?

01:16:36.472 --> 01:16:37.473
I haven't heard from you
in a long time,

01:16:37.505 --> 01:16:38.973
and I'm starting to worry.

01:16:39.007 --> 01:16:40.475
Do not come and get me.

01:16:40.508 --> 01:16:43.176
Do not come and get me.
I'm-I'm okay.

01:16:43.210 --> 01:16:45.345
Is everything okay?

01:16:45.379 --> 01:16:47.880
Um, I'm not sure.

01:16:47.913 --> 01:16:50.282
I think it might have shorted out
when you took it out of my head,

01:16:50.315 --> 01:16:52.984
which was very sexy.

01:16:53.018 --> 01:16:56.387
Are you really a spy?

01:16:58.087 --> 01:16:59.389
Yeah...

01:16:59.422 --> 01:17:02.524
I'm actually a super spy
for the US government.

01:17:02.557 --> 01:17:04.126
And my friend's in the party.

01:17:04.159 --> 01:17:06.127
I'm supposed to be
helping him spy on people,

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.161
but he never listens to me,

01:17:07.194 --> 01:17:09.596
which is why I'm out here
and he's in there.

01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:12.065
He's so egotistical.
He thinks he's the best in the world.

01:17:12.098 --> 01:17:15.234
He doesn't know anything.
He barely knows art. Art, chess.

01:17:15.267 --> 01:17:17.102
He thinks he knows chess,
but he doesn't.

01:17:17.136 --> 01:17:19.170
And he's put me in a little big
mess and I'm a little pissed off,

01:17:19.203 --> 01:17:22.272
but please
don't tell anybody.

01:17:25.108 --> 01:17:26.842
Well, if you hadn't
have gotten in this mess,

01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:28.277
you never would have met me.

01:17:29.078 --> 01:17:31.179
That is true.

01:17:38.351 --> 01:17:39.852
Hey, Phillip?

01:17:39.886 --> 01:17:42.521
Ooh, my bad.

01:17:42.554 --> 01:17:44.122
Hey...

01:17:44.156 --> 01:17:45.324
Ooh...

01:17:54.897 --> 01:17:57.498
How many more
of these orgy rooms were there?

01:17:57.532 --> 01:18:01.135
About 12. Yeah.

01:18:01.169 --> 01:18:04.471
Then just skip ahead.

01:18:04.504 --> 01:18:06.906
Not bad for a bartender.

01:18:09.075 --> 01:18:15.112
Self-taught, outcast,
overlooked, late bloomer.

01:18:15.145 --> 01:18:17.980
Despite the mountains
in your past,

01:18:18.014 --> 01:18:20.883
despite the thorns
in your veins,

01:18:20.917 --> 01:18:25.120
you have ascended
and made a crown of them.

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:29.956
And here we stand.

01:18:29.989 --> 01:18:34.126
With every move we make,
something moves within you.

01:18:34.159 --> 01:18:38.129
And like some distant ballet
of quantum entanglement,

01:18:38.162 --> 01:18:43.500
that still small voice
within you whispers, "I'm home."

01:18:45.702 --> 01:18:48.904
Don't try to think for me.
You're gonna lose.

01:18:51.206 --> 01:18:53.108
You poor thing.

01:18:54.475 --> 01:18:56.276
You poor, poor boy.

01:18:58.344 --> 01:19:01.480
You have been deprived
of so much.

01:19:01.513 --> 01:19:05.616
You still think the world
is so small.

01:19:05.650 --> 01:19:12.355
There is a war raging above and below
you, and through you at all times.

01:19:12.389 --> 01:19:16.492
And when we simply illuminate that
you have been told you were a pawn,

01:19:16.525 --> 01:19:18.426
when you are
in fact a queen,

01:19:18.459 --> 01:19:22.095
you spit at me
for simply shining the light!

01:19:22.129 --> 01:19:24.665
You can spew
all the poetry you want,

01:19:24.699 --> 01:19:29.235
you won't persuade me to think that
spreading that level of chaos is okay.

01:19:31.136 --> 01:19:33.238
Draw the line then, Connor.

01:19:39.542 --> 01:19:40.576
Tell me, please.

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:42.411
When poverty causes a father

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:45.213
to strike his own son.

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:48.115
When that ignorance
is guaranteed by the banks

01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:51.418
and the corporations
and the governments...

01:19:51.451 --> 01:19:58.189
When beautiful young minds are crushed
under the weight of that oppression.

01:20:00.224 --> 01:20:04.629
And before your rise
in your righteous wrath,

01:20:04.662 --> 01:20:08.197
they tighten the noose
around your passions.

01:20:08.230 --> 01:20:11.366
So where is it, Connor?
Where is this line, huh?

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.067
Is it here?

01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:16.503
Should they
remain in the dark, huh?

01:20:16.537 --> 01:20:19.005
What about...
what about them, hmm?

01:20:19.038 --> 01:20:20.006
Should they stay in chains?

01:20:20.039 --> 01:20:22.574
Shackled to the depravity
of their leaders?

01:20:22.607 --> 01:20:26.076
And what-what of...
what of these, huh?

01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:27.511
Or these? What of them?

01:20:27.545 --> 01:20:32.382
What good would they do awake?
Empowered? Enlightened?

01:20:33.149 --> 01:20:34.616
No good at all, right?

01:20:35.785 --> 01:20:39.721
So then just let them sleep!

01:20:46.258 --> 01:20:49.028
Make no mistake about it,
Connor.

01:20:50.462 --> 01:20:53.064
We are at war.

01:20:53.097 --> 01:20:55.999
It's up to you whether you
are a pawn or a queen.

01:20:57.167 --> 01:20:59.135
You and no one else.

01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:05.506
It is finally time
for us to emerge

01:21:05.539 --> 01:21:10.276
and unleash a chorus
of ideas upon the world.

01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:15.013
Connor, are you ready
for a promotion?

01:21:15.748 --> 01:21:17.248
I'm thinking about it.

01:21:17.683 --> 01:21:19.217
No, thanks.

01:21:24.722 --> 01:21:26.623
To the final test.

01:21:40.333 --> 01:21:42.234
Shit.

01:21:42.267 --> 01:21:43.301
Have a seat.

01:21:43.335 --> 01:21:45.070
What is this?

01:21:45.604 --> 01:21:47.037
Sit.

01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:59.715
Cicada 3301... is sacred.

01:22:01.248 --> 01:22:05.551
And both of you
tried to poison the holy well.

01:22:06.418 --> 01:22:07.787
Not me.

01:22:10.221 --> 01:22:13.791
NSA.

01:22:14.591 --> 01:22:15.760
Hmm?

01:22:16.761 --> 01:22:18.394
It's not obvious by now,

01:22:18.427 --> 01:22:21.063
we know you have both
been working with them.

01:22:21.097 --> 01:22:22.163
What?

01:22:23.398 --> 01:22:25.165
Oh, wait.

01:22:25.199 --> 01:22:27.334
You two didn't know.

01:22:27.368 --> 01:22:30.604
That is too cute.

01:22:30.638 --> 01:22:32.205
You have this all wrong.

01:22:32.238 --> 01:22:33.773
Oh, do I, Gwen?

01:22:33.806 --> 01:22:38.644
My dear, why don't you
tell Connor your real name.

01:22:40.444 --> 01:22:41.578
How do you know that?

01:22:41.612 --> 01:22:44.414
Wait, Gwen's not your real name?

01:22:45.682 --> 01:22:47.249
What's your name?

01:22:48.551 --> 01:22:50.518
I work for the NSA, yes,

01:22:50.552 --> 01:22:52.487
but I brought you files
that could change everything.

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.187
I've been trying to get you
these for months. I...

01:22:59.893 --> 01:23:03.194
I thought the Cicada would protect
me, give me amnesty.

01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:04.462
No.

01:23:04.496 --> 01:23:06.397
No? I'm trying to tell you
that I'm a traitor.

01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:08.833
- Yeah, no shit.
- To the US. Not you.

01:23:08.867 --> 01:23:11.267
- Gwen.
- Olivia.

01:23:11.301 --> 01:23:12.569
Olivia?

01:23:13.468 --> 01:23:14.837
Olivia is your name?

01:23:19.641 --> 01:23:22.409
You've been lying to me
this whole time.

01:23:22.442 --> 01:23:23.577
So did you.

01:23:23.611 --> 01:23:27.546
I'm not in fucking NSA.
They used me to get to Cicada.

01:23:27.581 --> 01:23:32.417
- They don't even know I'm here.
- Oh, actually, they do.

01:23:37.688 --> 01:23:39.255
I'm sorry.

01:23:41.757 --> 01:23:43.558
So none of it was real?

01:23:55.635 --> 01:23:57.468
Are you a lesbian or not?

01:23:57.501 --> 01:23:58.870
Are you serious?

01:23:58.904 --> 01:24:01.338
Oh, please.
You primate.

01:24:01.371 --> 01:24:02.707
Before you devolve anymore,

01:24:02.740 --> 01:24:06.676
can we please just get back
to the final test?

01:24:06.710 --> 01:24:10.278
Now, you have both proven yourselves
adept in a myriad of ways,

01:24:10.311 --> 01:24:16.249
and so what lies in the center
of your treasonous square

01:24:16.283 --> 01:24:19.786
is the only chance you get
at making things right.

01:24:22.588 --> 01:24:27.626
Sins must be paid for in blood.

01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:32.495
There is one bullet
in this pistol.

01:24:32.528 --> 01:24:35.665
Gwolivia, if you wish
to join our cause,

01:24:35.698 --> 01:24:38.366
you must put it in Connor
before he puts it in you.

01:24:38.399 --> 01:24:39.868
And, Connor, vice versa.

01:24:39.901 --> 01:24:42.670
If I shoot myself,
will you spare Connor?

01:24:42.703 --> 01:24:45.437
That is adorable, but no.

01:24:45.471 --> 01:24:48.540
As in life, doing nothing
is saying something too.

01:24:49.374 --> 01:24:50.643
If you leave it to us,

01:24:50.676 --> 01:24:51.644
both of your heads

01:24:51.677 --> 01:24:53.645
will paint the floor
like a Jackson Pollock.

01:24:53.678 --> 01:24:56.346
Yes? Gentlemen, please.

01:25:01.249 --> 01:25:04.419
Ready... aim...

01:25:09.389 --> 01:25:11.759
fire!

01:26:02.462 --> 01:26:05.431
Shots fired. Shots fired.
East wing, second floor.

01:26:18.474 --> 01:26:20.342
How's that for adorable, huh?

01:26:24.613 --> 01:26:26.948
- Hey. Hey.
- I'm so sorry.

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:28.882
Hey, don't say anything.

01:26:28.916 --> 01:26:30.283
I'm so sorry.

01:26:30.316 --> 01:26:31.785
Don't say anything.
Come on.

01:26:33.953 --> 01:26:36.388
It's all on there.

01:26:36.421 --> 01:26:38.389
I-I-I don't understand
what you're saying.

01:26:38.422 --> 01:26:40.759
Oh, God, you can take down
anyone in the world with this.

01:26:40.792 --> 01:26:43.961
What? You sneaky librarian.

01:26:43.994 --> 01:26:46.495
I knew there was
more to you than that.

01:26:46.529 --> 01:26:48.765
- Here.
- I thought that I could pull it off

01:26:48.798 --> 01:26:50.032
and no one would get hurt.

01:26:50.065 --> 01:26:51.332
I'm so sorry.

01:26:51.365 --> 01:26:52.534
No, no, don't talk.
Don't apologize.

01:26:52.568 --> 01:26:53.400
Just hold this.

01:26:53.433 --> 01:26:54.669
Listen to me,
if you don't get this

01:26:54.702 --> 01:26:55.737
somewhere safe right now,

01:26:55.770 --> 01:26:56.970
I die for nothing

01:26:57.003 --> 01:26:59.673
and the world hegemony
goes on forever.

01:27:01.073 --> 01:27:03.274
Listen, they're gonna
kill you, too,

01:27:03.308 --> 01:27:04.577
once they have it, okay?

01:27:04.610 --> 01:27:05.910
You need to go.

01:27:07.045 --> 01:27:08.646
Go, you idiot!

01:27:30.361 --> 01:27:31.597
There he is.

01:27:34.431 --> 01:27:35.867
Tell me why
I shouldn't kill you right now.

01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:37.934
- Wait! Just wait.
- Huh?!

01:27:37.968 --> 01:27:40.036
My name
is not Phillip Dubois.

01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:41.871
It's Charles Bundwig.

01:27:41.904 --> 01:27:44.506
Uh... I'm just an actor.

01:27:45.073 --> 01:27:46.440
You're fucking lying.

01:27:46.473 --> 01:27:47.642
I'm not.

01:27:47.675 --> 01:27:48.809
You're fucking lying!

01:27:48.842 --> 01:27:50.077
I'm not lying!

01:27:50.110 --> 01:27:51.377
I've got a wife
and I've got two kids!

01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:53.478
I live in Coventry,
I do theater!

01:27:53.513 --> 01:27:54.914
Look, look...

01:27:54.947 --> 01:27:57.616
they've been feeding me
the lines.

01:27:57.649 --> 01:27:58.884
They put money
in my account.

01:27:58.917 --> 01:28:00.786
I thought it was
an experimental theater thing!

01:28:00.818 --> 01:28:03.319
I didn't know the bullets
were fucking real!

01:28:04.054 --> 01:28:05.989
Who paid you?

01:28:06.022 --> 01:28:07.891
- I don't know. I never...
- Who fucking paid you?!

01:28:07.924 --> 01:28:11.093
I don't know! It was all online!
I never saw them!

01:28:11.126 --> 01:28:14.929
I don't wanna die.

01:28:18.832 --> 01:28:20.033
Fuck!

01:28:22.568 --> 01:28:23.836
Shit.

01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:34.076
Sit down.

01:28:34.110 --> 01:28:35.611
All right. Okay.

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:37.579
Fuck.

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:38.747
Shit.

01:28:46.786 --> 01:28:47.854
Fuck.

01:28:47.887 --> 01:28:49.121
Come on.

01:28:49.154 --> 01:28:50.622
Goddamnit.

01:28:52.890 --> 01:28:53.991
Yes.

01:28:55.425 --> 01:28:57.393
What are you typing?

01:28:57.426 --> 01:28:58.662
What are you doing?

01:28:58.695 --> 01:29:00.329
Waiting for
your big break, huh?

01:29:06.734 --> 01:29:07.569
Shit.

01:29:07.602 --> 01:29:10.369
Can you get us out of here?

01:29:12.673 --> 01:29:15.608
I'm gonna hide this
information where no one can find it.

01:29:15.641 --> 01:29:18.977
This is mine. It's mine.
That's it.

01:29:19.010 --> 01:29:22.079
You're gonna leave me alone,
I'm gonna leave you alone. Deal?

01:29:22.112 --> 01:29:23.147
Fucking deal.

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:25.414
Ah... that's it. Come on.

01:29:30.686 --> 01:29:32.588
- Open the goddamn door!
- Come on!

01:29:35.455 --> 01:29:37.023
Come on!

01:29:37.057 --> 01:29:38.457
Let's go.

01:29:42.828 --> 01:29:45.096
All right, open up.

01:29:45.129 --> 01:29:47.397
- Open the door, now!
- Shit.

01:29:50.466 --> 01:29:52.569
They're coming in the door!

01:29:54.436 --> 01:29:55.805
Shit.

01:29:55.838 --> 01:29:57.772
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

01:29:57.806 --> 01:29:59.641
If you wanna live,
you gotta jump.

01:30:04.777 --> 01:30:05.778
Come on!

01:30:05.812 --> 01:30:07.947
I'm just terribly afraid
of heights!

01:30:12.783 --> 01:30:14.752
No!

01:30:26.661 --> 01:30:28.896
He's got a gun.

01:30:50.946 --> 01:30:53.147
- Fuck yeah!
- Oh, my God!

01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:54.615
- We fucking got him!
- Yeah! Yeah!

01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:55.549
Fuck yeah!

01:30:57.150 --> 01:30:58.618
That's fuckin'...

01:31:01.954 --> 01:31:04.156
Unbelievable.

01:31:04.189 --> 01:31:06.456
How would I even pee?

01:31:06.491 --> 01:31:07.992
All right, Connor.

01:31:08.026 --> 01:31:09.626
Just don't die. Come on.

01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:15.798
Fuck.

01:31:15.831 --> 01:31:17.966
Fuck.

01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:21.468
Mr. Snuggles.

01:31:21.502 --> 01:31:24.604
Mr. fucking Snuggles.

01:31:24.637 --> 01:31:26.873
I don't even know
if I have my goddamn earpiece.

01:31:26.906 --> 01:31:28.440
Come on.

01:31:30.609 --> 01:31:33.544
Shit. Fuck.

01:31:33.577 --> 01:31:35.179
Goddamnit.

01:31:35.212 --> 01:31:36.846
Oh, shit.

01:31:39.749 --> 01:31:40.950
<i>So I fudged a little</i>

01:31:40.983 --> 01:31:43.085
<i>on how I got down. Big deal.</i>

01:31:43.118 --> 01:31:46.220
Mr. Bundwig was an actor?
Did I understand that correctly?

01:31:46.254 --> 01:31:50.724
Yup. That's what he told me before
dipshit blew his brains out.

01:31:50.757 --> 01:31:54.160
I'll be the first to admit
I don't fully understand

01:31:54.193 --> 01:31:56.795
all the technical jargon
you've discussed here today,

01:31:56.828 --> 01:31:59.898
but you have brought up
some issues about the NSA's

01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:02.766
alleged use of
information-gathering techniques.

01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:06.269
Fake charges, assault,
sexual harassment, torture.

01:32:06.302 --> 01:32:08.271
I mean, I could go
on and on and on and on.

01:32:08.304 --> 01:32:10.005
That is very concerning.

01:32:10.038 --> 01:32:11.206
Absolutely.

01:32:11.239 --> 01:32:12.773
And not something
that was discussed

01:32:12.807 --> 01:32:15.643
in the original FISA request.

01:32:15.676 --> 01:32:19.212
You also have just incriminated
yourself in so many felonies,

01:32:19.245 --> 01:32:22.514
I wouldn't know which
life sentence to begin with.

01:32:22.548 --> 01:32:26.884
And the only evidence you claim to have,
in your words, "would set you free,"

01:32:26.918 --> 01:32:30.921
as I understand it,
right here in this high heel?

01:32:35.024 --> 01:32:36.825
Tell me what I'm missing?

01:32:38.626 --> 01:32:40.261
Come on.

01:32:40.295 --> 01:32:42.229
Yes!

01:32:46.065 --> 01:32:48.501
What the... I shut my ringer off.

01:32:49.668 --> 01:32:50.902
You guys, man...

01:32:50.936 --> 01:32:51.970
Fucking morons.

01:32:52.004 --> 01:32:56.173
I mean, floating fish
in the middle of the room.

01:32:56.207 --> 01:32:57.774
You guys really believe that?

01:32:57.807 --> 01:33:00.909
Did you just admit
to lying under oath?

01:33:00.943 --> 01:33:03.278
Oath? What is this, the mafia?
You guys and the oath.

01:33:03.312 --> 01:33:06.047
It's a creative license
in telling a story.

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:10.250
The homeless guy who was
masturbating, that really happened.

01:33:10.283 --> 01:33:11.985
Wait.
What the hell is going on?

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:14.954
That phone call you
just received is a bot I created.

01:33:14.987 --> 01:33:16.554
One out of 25
you're set to receive.

01:33:16.588 --> 01:33:20.025
In a couple hours, you're gonna hear
about some breaking news around the world

01:33:20.058 --> 01:33:21.625
about some documents
that were leaked.

01:33:21.658 --> 01:33:24.927
Needless to say,
the vice president

01:33:24.961 --> 01:33:28.064
will be sleeping on
the couch tonight, baby.

01:33:28.097 --> 01:33:31.033
Countless others, including you,
will suffer the same fate

01:33:31.066 --> 01:33:33.100
unless you transfer
some funds in my account.

01:33:33.134 --> 01:33:35.636
Transfer? What...

01:33:35.669 --> 01:33:37.771
I... are you
trying to extort us?

01:33:37.804 --> 01:33:38.738
How dare you?

01:33:38.772 --> 01:33:40.206
Mike, get security in here now.

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.340
Your Honor,
I think you better hold...

01:33:41.373 --> 01:33:43.275
Mike, sit down.
You guys authorize unlawful

01:33:43.308 --> 01:33:44.942
information mining every day.

01:33:44.976 --> 01:33:46.677
I'm just cutting out
the middle man.

01:33:46.711 --> 01:33:49.146
I want one million for every
batch you don't want released.

01:33:49.179 --> 01:33:51.615
The schedule is for
every 30 days unless I check in.

01:33:51.648 --> 01:33:54.817
If I don't check in...

01:33:54.850 --> 01:33:56.551
So don't press your luck.

01:33:57.118 --> 01:33:59.621
Oh, one more thing;

01:33:59.654 --> 01:34:02.723
and Avi, I need him
released immediately.

01:34:02.756 --> 01:34:04.224
He's my best friend.

01:34:05.391 --> 01:34:07.593
I'll do anything for him.

01:34:09.061 --> 01:34:11.830
What about Cicada 3301?

01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:16.133
Maybe they'd bring
a little balance to the world.

01:34:16.167 --> 01:34:18.902
I like what they're about.

01:34:18.935 --> 01:34:21.203
Do I think we could get there
in a more cost-effective way?

01:34:21.236 --> 01:34:24.339
Absolutely. But, hey,
it's not my war to fight.

01:34:24.373 --> 01:34:26.607
I'll let you guys dig in.

01:34:26.641 --> 01:34:28.276
I'mma bring about change
my own way.

01:34:28.309 --> 01:34:32.578
And-and-and how do you
plan on doing that exactly?

01:34:33.312 --> 01:34:35.214
One sheep at a time.

01:34:37.882 --> 01:34:39.984
Give us a moment
to discuss this.

01:34:41.419 --> 01:34:45.855
Mike, Sullivan, Carver.

01:35:03.869 --> 01:35:05.670
Mmm, yummy.

01:35:05.703 --> 01:35:08.072
I call this the Wet Cicada.

01:35:08.106 --> 01:35:11.174
- Let's check it out...
- Yeah.

01:35:11.208 --> 01:35:12.242
Cheers.

01:35:13.410 --> 01:35:15.311
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

01:35:15.344 --> 01:35:16.312
Mm. Mm-mm.

01:35:16.345 --> 01:35:18.880
Nope.

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:20.647
- What?
- I don't like that one.

01:35:20.681 --> 01:35:22.082
No?

01:35:22.116 --> 01:35:23.350
Wow, I thought
you'd like that one.

01:35:23.383 --> 01:35:24.817
Put some bitters
in there and everything.

01:35:24.851 --> 01:35:26.219
- Taste like soap.
- What?

01:35:26.252 --> 01:35:27.787
- Nice soap.
- Right.

01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:31.289
- Oh, you're so cute.
- Oh, actually, no tipping.

01:35:31.323 --> 01:35:32.723
Anyway...

01:35:34.158 --> 01:35:35.292
Your friend's here.

01:35:37.861 --> 01:35:38.995
I'll take over.

01:35:39.028 --> 01:35:40.230
Okay.

01:35:40.263 --> 01:35:42.865
Thank you, Tori.

01:35:42.898 --> 01:35:43.932
Hey, you put an order in?

01:35:43.966 --> 01:35:45.099
Nope.

01:35:47.768 --> 01:35:49.035
What is it?

01:35:52.805 --> 01:35:55.408
Nothing. It's all good.

01:35:55.442 --> 01:35:58.309
See you in a bit.
Thank you, babe.

01:35:58.343 --> 01:36:01.278
<i>Institutions grab
power by wrapping their hands</i>

01:36:01.311 --> 01:36:03.180

01:36:03.213 --> 01:36:05.415
<i>and claiming ignorance

<i>in being a voice for another

01:37:51.127 --> 01:37:52.294
Hello?

01:37:53.896 --> 01:37:55.798
Is anybody there?

01:37:56.864 --> 01:37:59.033
Oh, God. Not again.

01:38:06.272 --> 01:38:07.441
Hey!

01:38:07.474 --> 01:38:09.908
Die, bitch!

01:38:09.941 --> 01:38:12.977
Fuck!
Oh, God!

01:38:15.145 --> 01:38:16.513
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- No!

01:38:19.916 --> 01:38:21.316
Oh, my God!

01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:23.352
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:38:23.386 --> 01:38:25.454
Oh, God!

01:38:30.491 --> 01:38:32.191
Jesus Christ!

01:38:35.227 --> 01:38:37.095
No! Not the book!

01:38:37.128 --> 01:38:38.796
Fucking cool it, man.

01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:46.269
I just came to return
a page of your book, okay?

01:38:46.302 --> 01:38:48.004
Now you're really dead meat.

01:39:03.549 --> 01:39:05.016
- Uh, your book.
- Oh.
