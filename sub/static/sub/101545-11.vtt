00:03.090 --> 00:04.004
Mistress: <i>
Previously on "The Outpost"...</i>

00:04.004 --> 00:06.267
That'’s the ancient
Blackblood temple.
She'’s in there.

00:06.267 --> 00:08.617
- Run, Janzo!
- Munt!

00:10.923 --> 00:13.361
- Aah! What was that?
- Are you all right?

00:13.361 --> 00:15.711
- Your weapons
are ineffective on me.
- We'’ll see about that.

00:18.583 --> 00:20.368
- Did it work?
- I think so.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.370
You cannot kill a god.

00:22.370 --> 00:25.547
- There is a black kinj.
- Would it kill Yavalla?

00:25.547 --> 00:27.679
It would kill whomever
its bearer touches.

00:27.679 --> 00:32.032
Gallwood Outpost is now
the greatest threat to peace
in our world.

00:32.032 --> 00:36.993
We must prepare to show them
the power of the United!

00:44.000 --> 00:45.349
And thrust!

00:59.320 --> 01:02.627
Good work.
You'’ll spend the rest of the day

01:02.627 --> 01:06.675
training with some
of our more experienced
soldiers.

01:06.675 --> 01:09.112
Tobin'’s finest.

01:09.112 --> 01:11.506
Sergeant,
take your men and pair up

01:11.506 --> 01:12.507
with the Queen'’s new recruits.

01:12.507 --> 01:13.769
Run the drills.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.265
Thank you, Sergeant.

01:31.265 --> 01:33.832
I'’m in no danger
from Commander Spears.

01:33.832 --> 01:36.096
He may approach me.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.749
And do as he ordered.

01:43.668 --> 01:45.757
What was that?

01:45.757 --> 01:49.326
My men don'’t serve
at your pleasure,
Commander Spears.

01:49.326 --> 01:51.546
Lord Tobin and I
are their commanders.

01:51.546 --> 01:56.072
You serve the Queen,
who has given me authority
to act in her name.

01:56.072 --> 01:57.421
Which is why
I approved your order.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.162
I don'’t need your approval.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.904
Really?

02:01.904 --> 02:03.384
Apparently you do.

02:17.659 --> 02:19.008
You wished to see me?

02:21.010 --> 02:23.360
Baroness, this Outpost
in the last safe haven

02:23.360 --> 02:24.753
against Yavalla'’s infection.

02:24.753 --> 02:28.452
Our impenetrability
may well be essential

02:28.452 --> 02:30.062
in the survival of our kind.

02:30.062 --> 02:32.587
I'’m aware.

02:32.587 --> 02:34.806
Then perhaps you might consider
supporting our efforts

02:34.806 --> 02:36.199
rather than hindering them.

02:40.072 --> 02:41.378
You were so threatened by me

02:41.378 --> 02:43.424
you went running
to tell the Queen.

02:43.424 --> 02:47.602
Trust me, Baroness,
I am not the least bit
threatened by you.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.125
The Queen put me
in command of her army.

02:49.125 --> 02:52.607
She did not put you
between me and my men.

02:54.391 --> 02:58.482
Hand over full control
of your army or get out.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.832
I won'’t ask you again.

03:00.832 --> 03:03.400
It'’s Lord Tobin
you need to speak to.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.749
It'’s his army.

03:04.749 --> 03:08.231
Lord Tobin'’s not the problem.
You are.

03:08.231 --> 03:11.756
I am loyal to my husband,
and he is loyal to you.

03:13.671 --> 03:16.587
As far as I'’ve seen, Baroness,
you'’re only loyal to yourself.

03:16.587 --> 03:21.679
You married Tobin not for love,
but to gain power.

03:21.679 --> 03:25.988
- That'’s not true.
- Then swear your allegiance
to me as your Queen.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.642
Stay out of my way.

03:39.610 --> 03:43.919
As long as Lord Tobin
serves you, Your Majesty,

03:43.919 --> 03:45.834
I will serve you.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.276
He'’ll never love you
like he loves Rosmund.

03:53.276 --> 03:54.364
Garret.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.370
What do you know about love?

04:00.370 --> 04:02.677
Red kinj! Aah! Aah!

04:08.509 --> 04:09.510
[ gasps ]

04:11.642 --> 04:14.210
[ both screaming ]

04:15.907 --> 04:18.345
Aah! Stop!

04:25.743 --> 04:27.179
Garret:
Are you all right?

04:32.315 --> 04:36.711
You try that again,
and I will kill you
where you stand.

04:40.671 --> 04:43.500
<i>[ theme music playing ]</i>

04:52.988 --> 04:55.730
I don'’t understand how that
would have kept anybody
away from us.

04:55.730 --> 04:57.949
Not anybody, Talon,
any insects.

04:57.949 --> 05:01.649
Insects are repelled
by bafler weed and roflo root.

05:01.649 --> 05:06.044
Yeah, well,
we have more to worry about
than just insects, Janzo.

05:06.044 --> 05:08.960
Insects can carry
the infection just as much
as any other animal.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.920
Oh, yes, I'’m sure Yavalla
is especially focused
on uniting with bugs.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.973
Are you all right?

05:21.973 --> 05:24.454
You and Zed just tried to burn
and decapitate my mother.

05:26.195 --> 05:28.371
- I'’m sorry, Wren.
- But she didn'’t die.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.201
My mother really cannot die.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.597
We have to find another way
to kill her.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.383
You'’re all right with that?

05:40.383 --> 05:43.038
I have to be.
I'’m the one who enabled her.

05:43.038 --> 05:45.562
I unlocked the meld box.
I solved the map.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.303
I did everything she needed.
This is my fault.

05:47.303 --> 05:49.653
Yeah, but you did all that
'’cause you're her daughter.

05:49.653 --> 05:52.003
- You had no way of knowing
what she was after--
- No, I should have known.

05:52.003 --> 05:53.788
I knew something wasn'’t right.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.137
From the moment she returned
with that meld box

05:55.137 --> 05:56.094
that she took from
your father, I knew it.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.922
She took the box?

05:57.922 --> 06:00.360
She said my father gave it
to her when he was dying.

06:00.360 --> 06:04.015
No. She took that box.

06:04.015 --> 06:06.017
- By force.
- Well, how do you know?

06:06.017 --> 06:07.802
Because Yavalla went in
with eight men

06:07.802 --> 06:10.195
and only three made it back.

06:10.195 --> 06:11.632
That tells me your father

06:11.632 --> 06:13.111
wasn'’t giving up
without a fight.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.287
Well, is there a chance
he'’s still alive?

06:15.287 --> 06:18.334
I wasn'’t there,
but from what I understand,
he'’s most likely dead.

06:18.334 --> 06:21.250
But there'’s a possibility?

06:21.250 --> 06:23.513
I'’m going to
the Plane of Ashes.

06:23.513 --> 06:26.255
- She just said
he'’s probably dead, Talon.
- Yeah, probably.

06:26.255 --> 06:29.867
- Not definitely.
- Talon, I know you really
want to meet your father,

06:29.867 --> 06:32.304
- but is now really
the right time?
- Now is exactly the time.

06:32.304 --> 06:34.045
If he knew where
the white kinj is,

06:34.045 --> 06:35.525
he could know where
the black one is, too.

06:35.525 --> 06:36.526
And we need that kinj.

06:36.526 --> 06:38.223
Might be our only hope.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.443
Talon, I'’m sorry. I truly am.

06:40.443 --> 06:43.315
But he'’s almost
certainly dead.

06:43.315 --> 06:45.056
You don'’t know that.

06:45.056 --> 06:47.885
I mean, for all we know,
he could have the black kinj.

06:47.885 --> 06:50.845
I mean, how else would
he single-handedly kill
five of Yavalla'’s men?

06:50.845 --> 06:52.847
Well, he didn'’t
kill them all, Talon.

06:52.847 --> 06:55.415
And he didn'’t stop Yavalla
from taking the box,

06:55.415 --> 06:57.068
which means
they probably killed him.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.896
I have to find out.

06:58.896 --> 07:00.420
Then we have to go
to the Outpost first.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.638
We don'’t have time
to go back to the Outpost.

07:01.638 --> 07:03.814
Talon, you don'’t understand.

07:03.814 --> 07:07.035
Even if Saivek survived,
you'’ll never be able
to find him.

07:07.035 --> 07:09.298
The lava tubes are an endless
maze and you can get lost

07:09.298 --> 07:11.431
in there for weeks
if you do now know your way.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.998
- Tell her, Zed.
- She'’s right.

07:13.998 --> 07:16.348
Without a guide or a map,
you could spend a lifetime
in those tubes.

07:16.348 --> 07:18.916
My mother had a map
of the tunnel system
where she found your father.

07:18.916 --> 07:21.919
I'’ve seen it.
Hopefully it'’s still
at the Outpost.

07:29.144 --> 07:31.363
Go on. You'’re clean.

07:36.064 --> 07:38.153
- Strom?
- Ana?

07:38.153 --> 07:39.894
It'’s you. You made it.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.722
I did what I had to do
to get my man.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.463
Unhand me. She'’s my wife.

07:46.378 --> 07:49.381
- She'’s infected.
- No! Please don'’t.

07:49.381 --> 07:52.472
You have to go now.
If you come back
within 100 paces,

07:52.472 --> 07:53.690
- they'’ll kill you.
- I can'’t leave you again.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.257
- Please go!
- Come with me.

07:55.257 --> 07:58.303
Join the United. You'’ll see.
It'’s wonderful.

08:02.873 --> 08:06.834
- I can'’t.
- I'’ll be waiting for you,
husband.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.934
- Spears!
- Tobin, I'’ve been
looking for you.

08:19.934 --> 08:23.981
- It'’s about Falista.
Are you all right?
- Yeah, I just heard.

08:23.981 --> 08:27.942
You threw her in jail
because her men respect her
more than you, is that right?

08:27.942 --> 08:30.684
- Have you been drinking?
- Yes. What of it?

08:30.684 --> 08:32.381
Falista has
the red kinj, all right?
She'’s very dangerous.

08:32.381 --> 08:33.948
- She'’s dangerous?
- Yes.

08:33.948 --> 08:36.037
Falista'’s dangerous?
That'’s funny.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.343
Little, beautiful,
tiny Falista is dangerous?

08:38.343 --> 08:40.345
Yes, hard as it might be
to believe.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.826
- She'’s my wife.
- All right.

08:42.826 --> 08:45.394
I think I'’d know a thing
like that wouldn'’t I, Spears?

08:47.178 --> 08:49.137
Do you want to know
what'’s more believable?

08:49.137 --> 08:51.139
What'’s that?

08:51.139 --> 08:56.492
You and Rosmund are
threatened by Falista.

08:56.492 --> 08:59.190
- All right.
- So you put her in jail
to control her.

08:59.190 --> 09:01.410
I-- whoa.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.672
- Now, I am telling
you the truth.
- No, you'’re not.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.195
- No, hey!
- [ growls ]

09:04.195 --> 09:06.850
Now, now, all right.
Hey. Hey!

09:06.850 --> 09:08.460
[ groans ]

09:09.766 --> 09:12.421
You made me do that.

09:12.421 --> 09:14.815
But there is no reason
that this has to get
any further-- no!

09:14.815 --> 09:18.340
<i>[ music playing ]</i>

09:21.038 --> 09:23.780
- Tobin!
- [ groaning ]

09:23.780 --> 09:25.782
Stop! Stop that.

09:25.782 --> 09:29.699
Ah! Hey!

09:29.699 --> 09:31.701
- No, no, no, no, no.
- [ yelling ]

09:31.701 --> 09:33.442
No, no, no!

09:35.923 --> 09:37.881
- What is wrong with you?
- Why are you doing this, huh?

09:37.881 --> 09:41.058
- To protect her honor?
- Drop it!

09:43.234 --> 09:46.237
- What are you doing?
- She forced you to marry her.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.457
- Did that hurt?
- Yes!

09:48.457 --> 09:51.242
- Good.
- Come on. No! Drop it!

09:51.242 --> 09:53.636
Drop it. Stop!
No, don'’t break the chair!

- Youbroke the chair.
- Tobin, I don'’t...

...want to hurt you.

10:03.907 --> 10:05.866
You'’re gonna have to pay
for that!

10:14.831 --> 10:19.053
Tobin, enough.

10:32.109 --> 10:35.286
Tobin, you need
to listen to me.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.854
I know you'’re angry that
I got the job that you wanted.

10:37.854 --> 10:39.595
I get that. I do.

10:39.595 --> 10:43.512
And maybe you think that
I'’m somehow responsible

10:43.512 --> 10:45.470
- for you losing Rosmund.
- Yes.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.865
Yes to which part?

10:48.865 --> 10:50.693
Yes to both.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.956
Well, you need to see
past that to our friendship.

10:52.956 --> 10:56.917
You need to look at everything
we'’ve been through together.

10:56.917 --> 11:00.442
All right? I would--
I would not lie to you.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.139
All right?

11:05.882 --> 11:08.015
Did I hear you right?

11:08.015 --> 11:09.146
That my wife has got a kinj?

11:09.146 --> 11:11.540
Yes.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.368
The red kinj that used
to be in One.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.892
- What?
- She used it on Rosmund.

11:15.892 --> 11:18.634
- She did what?
- And me.

11:18.634 --> 11:22.377
A few more seconds and
we both would have been dead.

11:22.377 --> 11:25.772
I wouldn'’t believe it myself
if I hadn'’t see it
with my own eyes.

11:25.772 --> 11:29.776
- I'’m gonna speak with her.
- Just be careful.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.908
That red kinj can kill you.

11:35.085 --> 11:37.174
You fight pretty well
for a drunk guy.

11:37.174 --> 11:40.830
[ both laughing ]

11:43.311 --> 11:46.618
- I'’ll go find that map.
- Let me know when you find it.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.450
- Where'’s Munt?
- Sorry, Warlita,
I couldn'’t save him.

11:52.450 --> 11:55.192
- He'’s dead?
- No. He'’s just infected.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.368
- Shut the gate and be
on the lookout.
- For what?

11:57.368 --> 12:00.545
The infected.
They could come alone
or in the hundreds.

12:00.545 --> 12:01.982
Seal this place tight.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.597
Tobin, stay back.

12:08.597 --> 12:11.121
I think I tried
to kill the Queen.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.123
You think?

12:13.123 --> 12:16.953
They said that thing
that was in Jaaris'’ head,

12:16.953 --> 12:19.303
the one that used
to hurt people--

12:19.303 --> 12:21.697
and now it'’s in my head.

12:21.697 --> 12:25.135
I don'’t understand.

12:25.135 --> 12:29.139
But when it happened,
I felt something here.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.619
And there was nobody else there,

12:30.619 --> 12:34.841
just me and the two of them
suffering horribly.

12:34.841 --> 12:38.496
- So you didn'’t mean
to hurt anyone.
- No.

12:38.496 --> 12:41.586
No, I don'’t think so.

12:43.153 --> 12:46.200
Then your friend Garret
said something about

12:46.200 --> 12:47.810
you loving Rosmund, not me.

12:47.810 --> 12:51.292
- He said that?
- Then I got so angry.

12:51.292 --> 12:55.165
Maybe I wanted to hurt him
or her. I don'’t--

12:55.165 --> 12:56.993
It'’s not your fault.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.299
You obviously don'’t know
how to control it.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.219
You'’re hurt.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.265
I'’m fine.

13:10.746 --> 13:13.662
Is it true what he said?

13:15.838 --> 13:17.318
I'’m gonna plead
your case to Rosmund.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.714
I'’m gonna
get you out of here.

13:32.246 --> 13:37.468
So, Yavalla can'’t be killed
and there'’s no cure.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.470
We might as well
join her ranks.

13:39.470 --> 13:41.646
There is one other option.

13:41.646 --> 13:45.215
- There'’s a black kinj.
- Ugh, another kinj.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.696
No, kinjes are only ever
the problem,

13:47.696 --> 13:50.264
- never the solution.
- Not necessarily.

13:50.264 --> 13:53.006
The green kinj brought you
and Tobin back from the dead.

13:53.006 --> 13:55.095
Yes, by killing two people.

13:55.095 --> 13:56.531
Don'’t you see, Talon?
There'’s always a price.

13:56.531 --> 13:59.012
Any price is worth
stopping Yavalla.

13:59.012 --> 14:01.057
What does the black kinj do?

14:03.407 --> 14:06.715
It'’s a death kinj,
Kills anyone it touches.

14:06.715 --> 14:10.545
- So it'’s a weapon?
- Maybe the only weapon
that'’ll kill Yavalla.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.721
Where is it?

14:12.721 --> 14:16.986
Don'’t suppose it's hiding
under the Outpost somewhere.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.292
There'’s someone
in the Plane of Ashes

14:18.292 --> 14:19.510
who might know where it is.

14:19.510 --> 14:20.903
Who?

14:22.513 --> 14:25.690
- My father.
- Oh.

14:27.649 --> 14:30.304
Forgive me, Talon, but...

14:30.304 --> 14:32.132
I thought you told me
that your father was dead.

14:34.569 --> 14:37.485
Probably. But there is
a chance he'’s still alive.

14:37.485 --> 14:40.053
Either way,
he'’s our only lead.

14:40.053 --> 14:41.924

Plane of Ashes.

14:43.534 --> 14:44.840
Talon, are you sure
you'’re not only going

14:44.840 --> 14:46.450

to see your father?

14:46.450 --> 14:48.539
Of course I want to see him.

What wouldn'’t you do
to see your father again?

14:50.585 --> 14:52.717
I understand.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.937
But perhaps it could wait?

14:54.937 --> 14:56.896
I really need you here
during this crisis.

Look,
I know it'’s a long shot,

15:02.466 --> 15:05.165

of stopping Yavalla, do you?

15:06.731 --> 15:07.602
No.

15:10.561 --> 15:14.391
Maybe we should all just escape
to the Plane of Ashes.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.959
You wouldn'’t last
five minutes there.
It'’s a deadly place.

25:07.984 --> 25:09.595
Before we get started,
I would like to clarify

25:09.595 --> 25:11.205
that I'’m doing this
at the request of Tobin

25:11.205 --> 25:13.294
and not out of the kindness
of my own heart.

25:13.294 --> 25:16.602
That'’s enough of my niceties.
Let'’s get on with it,
shall we?

25:16.602 --> 25:19.561
The thing inside your head,
it'’s called a kinj.

25:19.561 --> 25:24.000
They are living creatures
subsisting in cohabitation
with a host body.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.786
- A parasite?
- Not exactly.

25:26.786 --> 25:31.268
A parasite can be harmful
to the host, whereas a kinj,

25:31.268 --> 25:33.270
well, a kinj can offer
substantial benefits.

25:33.270 --> 25:35.751
But I don'’t want it
living in me.

25:35.751 --> 25:39.189
I want it out.
Can'’t you cut it out?

25:39.189 --> 25:42.758
As far as my research goes,
there are only two ways
to separate from a kinj.

25:42.758 --> 25:45.848
One is to-- to pass it on
to somebody else

25:45.848 --> 25:48.285
and the other is to die.

25:48.285 --> 25:52.812
Now, given that this somehow
found it'’s way into you
after Jaaris was killed,

25:52.812 --> 25:55.815
even death might not
get rid of it.

25:55.815 --> 25:59.383
But-- but I could pass it on
to someone.

25:59.383 --> 26:01.864
Yes.

26:01.864 --> 26:04.084
No, no.
Absolutely not.

26:04.084 --> 26:07.870
- Well, someone else.
- Well, I would hope not
just anybody, Falista.

26:07.870 --> 26:10.090
The red kinj is extremely
dangerous in the wrong hands.

26:10.090 --> 26:13.833

of my days in isolation

of you, Falista?

26:39.510 --> 26:43.297
Well, you'’ve come
to judge me for yourself.

26:43.297 --> 26:44.603
Whether you should let me out

26:44.603 --> 26:47.214
or leave me here to die.

of being queen.

make it easy for you.

26:54.482 --> 26:56.615
Don'’t let me out.

26:56.615 --> 27:00.314

- You'’re really prepared

27:00.314 --> 27:02.882

of your days in isolation?

27:02.882 --> 27:05.885
No, but it appears I must.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.587
You know, I see
what he sees in you.

27:14.676 --> 27:17.505
- I beg your pardon?
- I finally see what it is

27:17.505 --> 27:18.767
that Tobin loves about you.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.902
I mean, look at you.

27:22.902 --> 27:25.382
Wise, thoughtful,

27:25.382 --> 27:27.646
and you'’re always
so damn dignified.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.735
Flattering me isn'’t going
to change my decision.

27:29.735 --> 27:32.694
No.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.565
But it helped me make mine.

27:35.915 --> 27:37.438
What are you doing?

27:37.438 --> 27:39.396
Janzo says I can pass
the kinj to someone else.

27:39.396 --> 27:41.921
Clearly it should be you.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.313
You want to give
your kinj to me?

27:43.313 --> 27:44.575
You would make
most use of it.

27:44.575 --> 27:46.969
Surely you would learn
to use it wisely.

27:46.969 --> 27:50.146
- No, I'’m not sure I should.
- From what Janzo'’s told me,

27:50.146 --> 27:52.758
it would protect you
from Yavalla'’s kinj.

27:52.758 --> 27:56.152
And I know that
you would learn to use it
for well and for good.

27:56.152 --> 27:58.154
I would, yes.

27:58.154 --> 28:03.420
Then take it.
It belongs in you, not in me.

28:18.392 --> 28:19.262
I can'’t.

28:27.880 --> 28:31.013
If I took that kinj,
then I'’d be no better
than the Three.

28:31.013 --> 28:33.450
I don'’t want to rule by fear.

28:36.410 --> 28:37.803
Well, then leave me in here.

28:40.196 --> 28:41.458
I can'’t control it.

28:43.896 --> 28:45.027
I am dangerous.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.425
You know,
for what it'’s worth,

28:51.425 --> 28:53.122
I, too, see what Tobin
sees in you.

28:55.211 --> 28:57.823
Tobin sees very little
in me, apparently.

28:57.823 --> 29:02.392
On the contrary,
he came to me practically
begging for your release.

29:02.392 --> 29:07.267
He was acting like--
well, he was acting like a man
in love with his wife.

29:07.267 --> 29:11.010
I think that probably
has more to do with
our growing up together.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.663
Guards.

29:19.888 --> 29:23.239
Lower your weapons.

29:23.239 --> 29:24.893
Release the Baroness.
She'’s free to go.

29:24.893 --> 29:26.373
Why?

29:31.726 --> 29:33.815
I believe I misjudged you.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.817
You were willing to give
the power to me,

29:35.817 --> 29:38.646
and someone who does that is not
likely power hungry herself.

29:38.646 --> 29:42.868
But I can'’t control it.

29:42.868 --> 29:46.697
- What if I hurt someone?
- Go and see Zed and Talon.

29:46.697 --> 29:49.091
They can teach you.
Tell them I sent you.

29:52.573 --> 29:53.574
I trust you'’ll do
the right thing.

30:28.304 --> 30:30.045
Vorsevus had it!

30:30.045 --> 30:34.571
- He had it.
- That doesn'’t look like a map.

30:34.571 --> 30:36.878
When the lava flows run dry,
they leave a network
of passages behind--

30:36.878 --> 30:38.706
up, down, sideways.

30:38.706 --> 30:41.535
Best way to map them
is in three dimensions.

30:41.535 --> 30:43.842
Saivek lived deep inside
this web of tunnels here.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.932
- Are you sure?
- Uh, yes.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.542
- Then let'’s go now, Zed.
- Oh, no, no, no.

30:48.542 --> 30:50.065
Not so fast.
There'’s a problem.

30:50.065 --> 30:52.154
None of the notes say
which tunnel system this is.

30:52.154 --> 30:54.417
Right? So there
are hundreds of tunnels,

30:54.417 --> 30:55.810
but unless we know where
the right entrance is,

30:55.810 --> 30:57.072
we have no idea
where to start.

30:57.072 --> 31:00.162
Corven was still working
with Yavalla,

31:00.162 --> 31:03.252
- wasn'’t he?
- Yes. So?

31:03.252 --> 31:05.820
That'’s his stamp
on the bottom there.

31:05.820 --> 31:06.952
I recognize it.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.345
Which means he made this map.

31:09.345 --> 31:11.782
Corven will know
which tunnel system this is.

31:11.782 --> 31:13.741
Who'’s Corven?

31:13.741 --> 31:16.135
My younger brother.

31:16.135 --> 31:18.006
Brother? Never even knew
you had one.

31:18.006 --> 31:19.312
You'’ve never mentioned him.

31:19.312 --> 31:20.966
Well, in case
you didn'’t notice, Talon,

31:20.966 --> 31:23.490
I don'’t do a lot of talking
about my private life.

31:23.490 --> 31:24.883
Or is it just because
you left him behind
in the Plane of Ashes?

31:24.883 --> 31:26.232
I didn'’t want to leave him.

31:26.232 --> 31:27.233
Yavalla wanted him
with her, so--

31:27.233 --> 31:28.712
Oh, so he chose to stay?

31:28.712 --> 31:31.454
He was proud to serve
the Priestess.

31:31.454 --> 31:34.544
Mm-hmm. So you think he could
lead us to the right tunnels?

31:34.544 --> 31:37.243
Mm, I'’m sure he can.

31:37.243 --> 31:39.810
Gods, I can'’t wait to see him.

31:39.810 --> 31:41.421
- Really?
- Well, he is my brother.

31:43.989 --> 31:46.643
- Then I'’m coming with you.
- What? Why?

31:46.643 --> 31:48.428
Wren, we don'’t know what's on
the other side of the portal.

31:48.428 --> 31:51.344
There could be fire storms,
angry Blackfists, fire worms.

31:51.344 --> 31:53.346
Yes, yes. Do you not think
I know that, Talon?

31:53.346 --> 31:54.825
Believe me,
the Plane of Ashes

31:54.825 --> 31:56.566
is the last place I want
to return to.

31:56.566 --> 31:59.352
You are going to need me
to help with Corven.

31:59.352 --> 32:01.006
[ scoffs ]

32:01.006 --> 32:04.226
Look, I know Corven
had a little thing for you,

32:04.226 --> 32:06.750
but he'’s my brother,
and we'’re very close.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.709
I'’m sure he's gonna help us
without you being there.

32:08.709 --> 32:11.625
Mm, maybe not.

32:11.625 --> 32:12.800
Wren, what aren'’t you
telling me?

32:12.800 --> 32:14.715
Long story.

32:14.715 --> 32:17.239
Can you tell it on the way?
We need to go now.

32:17.239 --> 32:20.242
Now? Can I have half an hour
at least?

32:20.242 --> 32:21.983
Just to let Janzo know
that we'’re going.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.942
Wait a minute.
Tell me what'’s going on
with my brother.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.639
I will meet you
in half an hour.

32:25.639 --> 32:27.684
- At the Citadel.
- Mm-hmm.

32:31.993 --> 32:33.038
What the hell
was she talking about?

32:34.213 --> 32:35.257
I have no idea.

32:42.438 --> 32:44.658
Didn'’t think Wren
was going to find that map.

32:44.658 --> 32:46.660
And I never thought I'’d get to
go back to the Plane of Ashes.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.792
- Talon?
- How did you escape?

32:48.792 --> 32:50.055
Don'’t tell me
you killed someone.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.882
Calm down.
Rosmund released me.

32:51.882 --> 32:54.885
- She did? Why?
- You'’ll have to ask her that.

32:54.885 --> 32:57.062
- So, what do you want?
- Rosmund sent me.

32:57.062 --> 32:59.673
She wants you to teach me
how to control this--

32:59.673 --> 33:03.198
- this thing in my head.
- Your kinj?

33:03.198 --> 33:04.808
We don'’t have time for that.
We'’re on our way out.

33:04.808 --> 33:06.680
And even if
we did have enough time,
we couldn'’t teach you.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.812
You have to figure it out
on your own.

33:08.812 --> 33:10.510
Well, can'’t you just
answer some questions?

33:10.510 --> 33:12.773
Like, for example,
does it always hurt people

33:12.773 --> 33:14.209
without me telling it to?

33:14.209 --> 33:16.037
Without me being able
to stop it?

33:16.037 --> 33:17.821
Mine'’s never acted on its own.

33:17.821 --> 33:20.476
Mine has.
Once or twice to protect me.

33:20.476 --> 33:22.348
Did the kinj change you
when you got them?

33:22.348 --> 33:26.874
No. The power one gives you
can surely corrupt you.

33:26.874 --> 33:28.702
Yeah, just look at Zed.

33:28.702 --> 33:30.573
I didn'’t change at all
when I got the kinj.

33:30.573 --> 33:33.881
No. You were an ass already.

33:33.881 --> 33:34.925
She can'’t get enough of me.

33:38.059 --> 33:39.887
One piece of advice.

33:39.887 --> 33:41.628
Be careful
with that red kinj.

33:41.628 --> 33:44.065
Everyone who'’s had it
has been an evil bastard

33:44.065 --> 33:45.023
or has become one.

33:47.764 --> 33:49.549
And try not to lose
your temper.

34:03.911 --> 34:05.347
Tobin?

34:07.175 --> 34:08.046
Falista?

34:10.222 --> 34:11.788
You'’re free?

34:12.920 --> 34:15.444
Wait, did you--

34:15.444 --> 34:17.707
No. Everyone'’s fine.

34:17.707 --> 34:19.753
Rosmund released me.

34:19.753 --> 34:20.971
Stop.

34:23.452 --> 34:25.063
I'’m afraid I'll hurt you.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.459
I'’m not.

34:41.644 --> 34:43.211
I have something
to say to you.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.171
What'’s wrong?
Are you all right?

34:48.173 --> 34:49.783
I know you argued
on my behalf

34:49.783 --> 34:52.133
to the Queen
to have me released.

34:52.133 --> 34:54.570
Thank you so much
for doing that.

34:54.570 --> 34:57.225
It means so much to me
that you defended me.

34:57.225 --> 34:59.619
Of course.

34:59.619 --> 35:02.012
But now I--

35:03.579 --> 35:06.147
Now I realize how...

35:06.147 --> 35:09.411
honorable and wise
our queen is.

35:11.587 --> 35:14.634
I was wrong to come
between you both.

35:14.634 --> 35:18.028
I mean, if I was a man,
I'’d be in love with her myself.

35:18.028 --> 35:22.032
- Falista.
- So I'’ve made the decision

35:22.032 --> 35:24.818
to hereby release you
from our marriage vows.

35:26.385 --> 35:29.083
You'’re now free
to marry Rosmund,

35:29.083 --> 35:32.086
and my army will remain
loyal to you as promised.

35:40.181 --> 35:42.140
I don'’t know what to say.

35:44.881 --> 35:47.971
<i>[ music playing ]</i>

36:07.904 --> 36:10.516
- I'’ll show them crazy.
- Wren: Ah! Janzo, I--

36:10.516 --> 36:11.865
I need to speak to you
about something.

36:11.865 --> 36:13.867
One moment. Watch this.
You might enjoy it.

36:13.867 --> 36:16.348
Muggs:
Ten for two! Come on.

36:16.348 --> 36:20.482
Ahem! Listen up,
you gullible peasants!

36:20.482 --> 36:24.269
Now allow me to demonstrate
my own magical elixir
on all of you.

36:24.269 --> 36:28.925
I will now reveal that
one of you is infected. Ooh.

36:28.925 --> 36:32.407
Introducing...
my magic finger.

36:32.407 --> 36:34.453
This magic finger will lead us

36:34.453 --> 36:36.455
to the indisputable
biggest threat

36:36.455 --> 36:37.673
to the security
of this Outpost.

36:37.673 --> 36:39.762
Please observe. Ah!

36:41.329 --> 36:43.113
For gods'’ sake.

36:43.113 --> 36:46.900
Ah. Nah.

36:46.900 --> 36:50.120
Hmm, ah. Ah!

36:50.120 --> 36:52.558
You'’re making a fool
of yourself, little man.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.734
Am I really?

36:54.734 --> 36:58.607
Ah! Hmm.

36:58.607 --> 37:01.610
- Mwah!
- Man: Oh.

37:01.610 --> 37:03.525
Exactly. "Oh."

37:03.525 --> 37:05.701
Fear not, my fellow peasants.

37:05.701 --> 37:10.619
This sleazy monstrosity
of a hustler

37:10.619 --> 37:13.492
isn'’t actually infected.

37:13.492 --> 37:17.017
Hmph. This is a common
nightglue beetle.

37:17.017 --> 37:20.194
When smashed alive
onto somebody'’s forehead,

37:20.194 --> 37:22.544
it leaves a glowing
phosphorescence

37:22.544 --> 37:24.285
for just long enough

37:24.285 --> 37:25.373
to convince you all to buy...

37:28.028 --> 37:29.116
...his wilderberry juice.

37:29.116 --> 37:31.292
Isn'’t that right?

37:31.292 --> 37:33.033
This wilderberry juice

37:33.033 --> 37:34.643
is no more of a cure

37:34.643 --> 37:36.776
than the common man'’s water.

37:38.647 --> 37:42.216
This man has jeopardized

37:42.216 --> 37:45.350
the integrity of this Outpost
against infection.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.265
And he'’ll answer
to the law for it.

37:53.358 --> 37:56.143
Step aside! Step aside!
This man is under arrest.

37:56.143 --> 37:58.972
- Right. Janzo--
- Did you see what I did there?

37:58.972 --> 38:00.974
- Yes.
- I put that crook in his place

38:00.974 --> 38:03.542
and I was bloody brilliant.

38:03.542 --> 38:06.196
I'’m going to the Plane of Ashes
with Talon and Zed.

38:06.196 --> 38:07.546
No. No, you'’re not.
We'’ll let someone else do it.

38:07.546 --> 38:09.330
Uh, believe me, I wish I could.

38:09.330 --> 38:11.550
It has to be me.
They won'’t succeed
without my help.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.900
Well, why you? I mean,
what do you have to offer?

38:13.900 --> 38:16.555
I mean, you'’re not exactly
a fighter, are you?

38:16.555 --> 38:18.557
They need the help
of another Blackblood,

38:18.557 --> 38:20.123
one who is likely only
to be willing to help me.

38:20.123 --> 38:21.951
Why only you?

38:21.951 --> 38:24.998
Because he'’s sort of
crazy in love with me.

38:24.998 --> 38:28.567
- An old boyfriend?
- More of an old patient.

38:28.567 --> 38:30.830
When I said that he was
crazy in love with me,

38:30.830 --> 38:32.092
the operative word there
was crazy.

38:32.092 --> 38:33.180
I don'’t understand.

38:33.180 --> 38:35.400
[ groans ]
It'’s a long story.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.620
All right,
uh, I saved his life--
never mind details.

38:38.620 --> 38:41.928
He'’s insane,
as in he tries to kill anyone
who goes near him except me.

38:41.928 --> 38:44.322
Wren, this man sounds
very dangerous.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.237
He'’s the only one who can
locate the lava tubes
that Talon needs to find.

38:47.237 --> 38:49.805
And he'’s most likely only
going to do that for me,

38:49.805 --> 38:51.546
assuming that he still likes me,

38:51.546 --> 38:53.679
given that I abandoned him
in the Plane of Ashes and all.

38:53.679 --> 38:55.942
This is very, very dangerous.
I'’d really rather not lose you.

38:55.942 --> 38:57.813
Well, I'’ll be back
before you know it.

38:57.813 --> 38:59.424
Taken literally,
"back before you know it,"

38:59.424 --> 39:01.251
that means when you do
eventually return,

39:01.251 --> 39:04.298
then I won'’t know
until later on and then--

39:04.298 --> 39:06.648
- Mmm.
- Shut up.

39:10.260 --> 39:11.436
Come on.

39:13.002 --> 39:13.829
Wren, do you have to go?

39:21.054 --> 39:23.448
There you are.
We almost left without you.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.972
I almost wish you did.
Must you take Wren?

39:25.972 --> 39:28.627
- Well, that'’s up to her.
- They need me, Janzo.

39:28.627 --> 39:31.369
Believe me, if they didn'’t,
I would never go back there.

39:33.806 --> 39:37.679
I was thinking,
how do we know where
we'’ll come out in the Planes?

39:37.679 --> 39:39.812
Best I can tell,
if the portal isn'’t targeting
a summoned name,

39:39.812 --> 39:41.074
it goes to where
it last left from.

39:41.074 --> 39:42.684
Wherever Yavalla left from.

39:44.773 --> 39:47.907
Ah, hopefully someone
with some common sense.

39:47.907 --> 39:51.389
Maybe the queen can talk you all
out of this suicide mission.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.955
Rosmund: Janzo,
you know as well as I do

39:52.955 --> 39:54.479
you can'’t talk Talon
out of anything.

39:57.133 --> 39:59.135
Not too late, am I?

40:04.967 --> 40:07.100
I'’d give you some advice,
but not sure you'’d listen.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.015
[ chuckles ]
Probably not.

40:09.015 --> 40:11.539
Come back alive, all right?

40:11.539 --> 40:13.323
I always do.

40:21.157 --> 40:24.030
<i>[ music playing ]</i>

41:01.937 --> 41:05.767
<i>[ ghostly whispering ]</i>

41:44.545 --> 41:46.329
Come in, my followers.

41:46.329 --> 41:51.030
We shall conquer this Outpost
one by one.
