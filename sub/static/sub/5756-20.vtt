WEBVTT

00:00.468 --> 00:03.769
<i> PREVIOUSLY ON</i>
PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:03.771 --> 00:06.805
I'M NOT ASHAMED OF WHO I AM,
BUT I USED TO BE,

00:06.807 --> 00:08.640
<i> AND IF WE HAVE TO HIDE</i>
<i> LIKE THIS ALL THE TIME,</i>

00:08.642 --> 00:11.510
<i> I'M GONNA START TO</i>
<i> FEEL THAT WAY AGAIN.</i>

00:11.512 --> 00:14.446
THE LYING,
THE SNEAKING AROUND--
I FEEL LIKE A TEENAGER.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.115
YEAH. IT'S FUN,
ISN'T IT?

00:19.387 --> 00:20.886
I FOUND THIS IN THE BASEMENT.

00:22.423 --> 00:25.724
JUST GO...
AND DON'T COME BACK.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.493
WELCOME HOME, HONEY.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.061
WOW.

00:29.063 --> 00:32.164
Jenna:<i> I UNDERSTAND WHY</i>
<i> YOU'RE SO FOND OF MR. FITZ.</i>

00:32.166 --> 00:35.000
HE TAKES SUCH A PERSONAL
INTEREST IN HIS STUDENTS.

00:35.002 --> 00:37.269
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
WITH CALEB.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.971
<i> WE CAMPED OUT.</i>

00:40.608 --> 00:42.174
<i> I FIGURED OUT</i>
<i> WHAT THE MESSAGE MEANS.</i>

00:42.176 --> 00:45.010
IT WASN'T B-A-D,
IT WAS THE NUMBER 2-1-4.

00:45.012 --> 00:47.679
DOES THAT NUMBER
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?
IT COULD BE ANYTHING.

00:47.681 --> 00:51.183
<i> WE HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT...</i>
<i> FOR BOTH OUR SAKES.</i>

00:51.185 --> 00:54.219
YOU CAN STAY HERE
FOR A SHORT TIME,
IN THE GUEST ROOM.

00:54.221 --> 00:57.189
THANK YOU.
I DID IT FOR HANNA,
NOT YOU.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.458
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.728
IT'S OVER. I'M OUT.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.496
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU,
BUT YOU NEED TO START

01:04.498 --> 01:05.998
BEING COMPLETELY HONEST
WITH US.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.433
THE POLICE ARE WAITING
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.867
THEY KNOW YOU LIED TO THEM.

01:08.869 --> 01:11.703
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?
( cell phones beep )

01:11.705 --> 01:15.207
"SPENCER HASTINGS
NOW A PERSON OF INTEREST...

01:15.209 --> 01:16.842
"IN MY DEATH.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.110
All: 'A.'"

01:21.715 --> 01:25.017
I FEEL LIKE WHOLE PARTS
OF MY BRAIN HAVE SHUT DOWN.

01:25.019 --> 01:28.220
I USED TO<i> LOVE</i> ALGEBRA,
OR AT LEAST I UNDERSTOOD IT.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.555
AND NOW IT'S A MESS.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.623
WELL, IT CAN GET
REALLY ABSTRACT.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.492
YEAH, BUT THAT'S WHAT
I LIKED ABOUT IT.

01:33.494 --> 01:36.595
YOU KNOW? X's, Y's, Z's--
NONE OF IT REAL.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.263
I COULD DEAL WITH THAT.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.065
YOU JUST ISOLATE
THE X FACTOR.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.468
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE
<i> I'M</i> THE X FACTOR.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.269
HONEY, WHERE WERE YOU?

01:44.271 --> 01:47.239
WE STOPPED ALONG THE WAY
AT EMILY'S.
NOW, DON'T WORRY,

01:47.241 --> 01:48.574
I WAS EXPECTING THIS.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.075
IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT
INTIMIDATION,

01:50.077 --> 01:52.678
SO I WANT YOU TO STAY CALM.
STAY CALM ABOUT WHAT?

01:52.680 --> 01:54.880
THEY SERVED
A SEARCH WARRANT.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.381
A SEARCH WARRANT?

01:56.383 --> 01:58.784
FOR WHERE? FOR WHAT?

01:58.786 --> 02:01.086
THE HOUSE, THE BARN,
YOUR ROOM--

02:01.088 --> 02:02.554
MY ROOM?

02:02.556 --> 02:05.290
SPENCER, DON'T INTERFERE.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.391
HONEY.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.067
MAKE THEM GET OUT.

02:15.069 --> 02:16.468
I CAN'T.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.470
YOUR A PERSON OF INTEREST
IN A MURDER INVESTIGATION.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.339
THEY'RE JUST DOING THEIR JOB.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.641
IN AN ESPECIALLY
HAM-FISTED WAY.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.976
WHAT ARE THEY
LOOKING FOR?

02:23.978 --> 02:26.411
THINGS THAT CONNECT YOU
TO ALISON...

02:26.413 --> 02:28.113
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

02:40.794 --> 02:43.462
<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET,</i>
<i> CAN YOU KEEP IT ¶</i>

02:43.464 --> 02:45.998
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE</i>
<i> YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

02:46.000 --> 02:48.534
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

02:48.536 --> 02:51.069
<i> ¶ TAKIN' THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

02:51.071 --> 02:53.639
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW ME</i>
<i> THEN I'LL KNOW YOU ¶</i>

02:53.641 --> 02:56.108
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

02:56.110 --> 02:58.610
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO CAN</i>
<i> KEEP A SECRET ¶</i>

02:58.612 --> 03:00.913
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD ¶¶</i>

03:03.517 --> 03:05.083
YOU MEAN THEY JUST CAME IN

03:05.085 --> 03:06.885
AND STARTED GOING THROUGH
HER THINGS?

03:06.887 --> 03:07.719
( door closes )

03:09.023 --> 03:11.190
LET ME CALL YOU BACK, EM.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.324
OKAY, BYE.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.359
GOOD MORNING.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.527
GOOD MORNING.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.499
HEY, UH, LISTEN,
YOUR MOM CALLED.

03:20.501 --> 03:21.867
SHE'S GONNA BE
SWINGING BY FOR COFFEE,

03:21.869 --> 03:23.535
SEE IF YOU GUYS
WANT A LIFT TO SCHOOL.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.271
SHE'S<i> COMING</i> FOR COFFEE?

03:26.273 --> 03:27.639
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

03:27.641 --> 03:31.743
SO THE KITCHEN TABLE EXISTS
IN ANOTHER DIMENSION

03:31.745 --> 03:33.946
WHERE THAT
ALREADY HAPPENED?

03:33.948 --> 03:35.914
I HEARD THE DOOR SLAM.

03:35.916 --> 03:39.418
WAS THAT MOM,
OR WAS THAT SOMEBODY ELSE?

03:39.420 --> 03:43.055
UH, NO. NO, THAT WAS,
UH, YOUR MOM.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.190
SO SHE WAS ALREADY HERE
THIS MORNING.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.926
WHY DOES SHE HAVE TO LEAVE
AND FAKE COMING BACK?

03:49.997 --> 03:52.497
BECAUSE SHE WASN'T JUST HERE
THIS MORNING,

03:52.499 --> 03:55.100
SHE WAS HERE LAST NIGHT.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.768
MOM WAS HERE ALL NIGHT?

03:56.770 --> 03:58.770
LISTEN, WHEN YOUR BROTHER
COMES DOWN,

03:58.772 --> 04:00.239
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS.

04:00.241 --> 04:03.208
WAIT. YOU<i> SNUCK</i> MOM
INTO YOUR ROOM LAST NIGHT?

04:03.210 --> 04:05.911
TECHNICALLY, YOU CANNOT
SNEAK INTO YOUR OWN HOUSE.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.247
OH. I'M GONNA
REMEMBER THAT.
( door shuts )

04:08.249 --> 04:09.414
HEY--
Ella: HEY!

04:09.416 --> 04:10.782
DID YOUR DAD
TELL YOU I CALLED?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.017
I WAS JUST AROUND THE CORNER

04:12.019 --> 04:13.285
SO I THOUGHT
I'D TAKE YOU TO SCHOOL.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.423
UM, WE'RE BUSTED.

04:20.194 --> 04:21.393
OH.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.395
YOU SLEPT HERE
LAST NIGHT?

04:23.397 --> 04:27.399
UH, IT JUST
SORT OF HAPPENED.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.534
SO...

04:29.536 --> 04:32.537
YOU GUYS, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE GETTING BACK TOGETHER?

04:32.539 --> 04:34.439
WE DON'T KNOW.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.675
N-NO--WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.212
YOU DON'T LOOK SURPRISED.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.117
WHAT'S WRONG?

04:45.119 --> 04:46.418
NOTHING.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.786
NOTHING'S WRONG.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.588
Ella:
WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT

04:49.590 --> 04:52.924
HOW THINGS MIGHT
CHANGE AROUND HERE.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.060
I DON'T NEED
ANY MORE OF THAT.

04:55.062 --> 04:59.131
NO, YOUR MOM MEANS
MAYBE CHANGE<i> BACK.</i>

04:59.133 --> 05:03.168
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT
TRYING SOMETHING.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.870
YOU COMIN' BACK?

05:04.872 --> 05:08.040
WELL, I MEAN, THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS

05:08.042 --> 05:09.441
AS A FAMILY.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.809
WELL, HOW ABOUT DINNER?

05:10.811 --> 05:13.211
MIKE AND I COULD
MAKE YOU GUYS DINNER.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.650
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.686
SOUNDS...GOOD.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.421
YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.325
Hanna: ARE YOU
GOING TO SCHOOL?

05:26.327 --> 05:28.226
OKAY. LATER.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.164
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:32.166 --> 05:33.865
THE POLICE WERE AT
SPENCER'S HOUSE.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.068
THEY HAD
A SEARCH WARRANT.

05:36.070 --> 05:39.338
WELL, WHAT ARE THEY
LOOKING FOR?

05:39.340 --> 05:41.206
SALT?

05:41.208 --> 05:42.474
NO, THANKS.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.981
SO, YOU SAID THE COPS
WERE AT SPENCER'S HOUSE?

05:51.518 --> 05:52.884
GOOD MORNING.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.519
MORNING.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.754
OKAY, CALEB,

05:55.756 --> 05:58.623
THE SECOND FLOOR IS ALL YOURS.

05:58.625 --> 05:59.925
I'LL GRAB A SHOWER.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.297
FRIED EGGS,
BURNED BUTTER--

06:05.299 --> 06:07.799
THE KITCHEN HASN'T SMELLED
LIKE THIS IN A LONG TIME.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.001
WELL, IT'S A GOOD SMELL.
I LIKE IT.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.537
JUST DON'T LET HIM
MAKE YOU LATE TO SCHOOL.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.773
I WON'T. HE CAN
FINISH THIS ON THE WAY.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.275
SEE YOU TONIGHT.
OKAY.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.288
( door opens, shuts )

06:38.031 --> 06:41.333
IT'S SO PRETTY, HANNA.
WHEN DID HE GIVE IT TO YOU?

06:41.335 --> 06:45.103
HE HASN'T GIVEN IT TO ME,
NOT YET. I FOUND IT.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.439
AND I WASN'T LOOKING FOR IT,
BUT I FOUND IT,

06:47.441 --> 06:49.708
AND I TOOK A PICTURE,
AND THEN I JUST PUT IT BACK.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.410
WHY AN OWL?

06:51.412 --> 06:52.978
IT'S SYMBOLIC.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.279
OF WHAT?

06:54.281 --> 06:56.148
OF OUR FIRST NIGHT

06:56.150 --> 06:57.482
IN THE TENT.

06:57.484 --> 07:00.152
WE HEARD OWLS.

07:00.154 --> 07:02.854
SWOOPING DOWN TO
CARRY OFF THEIR PREY?

07:02.856 --> 07:05.123
YOU CANNOT STOP
THE ROMANCE.

07:05.125 --> 07:09.127
OWLS AND TENTS AND S'MORES
ARE ALL PART OF THAT NIGHT--

07:09.129 --> 07:11.029
EVERY PERFECT MINUTE OF IT.

07:11.031 --> 07:14.433
HAVE YOU TWO HAD...
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY?

07:14.435 --> 07:17.803
NOT SINCE HE WENT
IN THE GUEST ROOM,
BUT WE DO HAVE PLANS.

07:19.673 --> 07:23.008
Paige: APPLES AND SPICE?

07:23.010 --> 07:25.811
YEAH, IT'S REALLY GOOD FOR YOU.
HEALTHY, WHICH IS NICE.

07:25.813 --> 07:28.146
WHEN DID<i> THAT</i>
START TO HAPPEN?

07:28.148 --> 07:30.449
( laughing )
YEAH? THAT'S AWESOME.
ARE YOU CAPTAIN?

07:30.451 --> 07:31.917
YEAH.
NICE. ME TOO.

07:31.919 --> 07:35.620
OH, EM. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IT'S TOTALLY COOL.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.657
I MEAN, THE BREAKUP
WAS WAY MESSY,
BUT SEAN'S A GOOD GUY.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.159
I MEAN, HE SHOULD BE HAPPY.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.161
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE
AS HAPPY AS I AM.

07:43.163 --> 07:47.165
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD
PRACTICE MY SURPRISE FACE
WHEN HE GIVES IT TO ME.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.604
( all laugh )

07:58.745 --> 08:00.378
HEY. ARE YOU OKAY?

08:00.380 --> 08:02.747
YEAH, WE DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE COMING IN TODAY.

08:02.749 --> 08:04.749
I HAVE TO BE SOMEPLACE
OTHER THAN MY HOUSE.

08:04.751 --> 08:07.719
ARE THE COPS STILL THERE?
THEY CAME AND WENT.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.120
THEY ACTUALLY
TOOK THINGS?

08:09.122 --> 08:13.525
NOT SO MUCH. MY MOM SAYS
THEY DID IT JUST TO SHAKE ME UP.

08:13.527 --> 08:14.893
WHAT'D THEY TAKE?

08:14.895 --> 08:17.996
UM, THINGS FROM
MY JEWELRY BOX,

08:17.998 --> 08:20.665
STUFF FROM MY CLOSET,
A COUPLE OF PAIRS OF SHOES--

08:20.667 --> 08:23.401
WAIT. NOT THE TORY BURCHES.
HANNA.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.403
NO, SNEAKERS.

08:25.405 --> 08:27.906
THEY WANTED MY LAPTOP,
BUT MY MOM SAID NO,

08:27.908 --> 08:30.175
IT WASN'T IN THE SEARCH WARRANT
AND THEY COULDN'T HAVE IT.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.912
LOOK, YOU GUYS SHOULD KNOW
THAT THERE'S A CHANCE

08:33.914 --> 08:35.580
THAT THEY MIGHT TRY TO
PULL THIS ON YOU.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.349
SEARCH OUR ROOMS?

08:37.351 --> 08:40.685
MY MOM SAYS
IT'S A POSSIBILITY.
I'M SO SORRY.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.454
NO--
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

08:42.456 --> 08:45.223
YEAH. WE KNOW WHO'S
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

08:45.225 --> 08:48.260
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT
THAT TROPHY WAS
SOME KIND OF TRAP.

08:48.262 --> 08:51.062
IT'S LIKE I CAN HEAR "A"
LAUGHING IN MY HEAD.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.498
DOES "A" SOUND LIKE JENNA?

08:53.500 --> 08:55.567
( cell phone beeps )

08:55.569 --> 08:56.635
IT'S MY MOM.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.838
SHE WANTS ME TO COME HOME.

09:01.475 --> 09:03.475
WALK ME OUT, OKAY?
SURE.

09:03.477 --> 09:04.876
YEAH, SURE.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.349
ARIA, COME ON.
JUST A SECOND.

09:18.592 --> 09:23.328
<i> ¶ I'VE GOTTA</i>
<i> A PLACE TO HIDE ¶</i>

09:23.330 --> 09:27.265
<i> ¶ GET YOUR SUITCASE,</i>
<i> I'LL CRAWL INSIDE ¶</i>

09:27.267 --> 09:30.302
<i> ¶ TO SEE WHAT COULD HAPPEN ¶</i>

09:30.304 --> 09:34.806
<i> ¶ WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN</i>
<i> WHEN WE GET CLOSE ¶</i>

09:39.880 --> 09:44.249
<i> ¶ WE'LL TAKE THE HIGHWAY</i>
<i> TILL IT DEAD-ENDS... ¶</i>

09:44.251 --> 09:46.484
HEY, EMILY,
GOT A SECOND?

09:46.486 --> 09:48.887
I HAVE TO GET ALL THE WAY
OVER TO THE ANNEX.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.056
CAN I WALK YOU?
SURE.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.525
I JUST WANT TO
ASK YOU SOMETHING.
OKAY.

09:53.527 --> 09:56.995
YOU'RE TEAMMATES WITH
PAIGE McCULLERS, RIGHT?
RIGHT.

09:56.997 --> 09:59.864
IS SHE SEEING ANYBODY?
'CAUSE I LIKE HER, SHE'S FUN,

09:59.866 --> 10:02.133
BUT I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
COMPLICATED RIGHT NOW.

10:02.135 --> 10:05.036
I DON'T KNOW, SEAN.
PAIGE ISN'T REALLY MY FRIEND.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.706
OH. OH, I GET IT.
I SHOULDN'T BE ASKING YOU.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.674
YOUR HANNA'S FRIEND.
I'M WAY OUT OF LINE.

10:09.676 --> 10:11.409
NO, SEAN, THAT'S OKAY.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.311
HANNA SAW YOU AT THE TABLE
WITH PAIGE.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.513
SHE SAID YOU'VE GOT
EVERY RIGHT TO BE HAPPY.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.682
SHE SAID THAT?

10:17.684 --> 10:20.151
I THINK SHE MEANT IT.
WOW.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.921
AS FOR PAIGE,
WE SWIM ON THE SAME TEAM,

10:22.923 --> 10:25.490
BUT I DON'T KNOW HER
THAT WELL.

10:25.492 --> 10:26.858
GOTCHA. THANKS.

10:30.497 --> 10:34.866
SO TELL ME, HOW LONG
HAVE YOU KNOWN ABOUT
YOUR FATHER AND ME?

10:34.868 --> 10:36.635
YOU TOLD US THIS MORNING.

10:40.374 --> 10:43.908
I GUESS I JUST SORT OF
HAD A FEELING SOMETHING WAS UP.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.378
AND ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

10:46.380 --> 10:49.014
YEAH,
I'M BEYOND OKAY.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.649
AS LONG AS IT'S WHAT
YOU AND DAD WANT.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.517
WELL, THIS PART
REALLY ISN'T ABOUT US.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.052
IT'S ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR BROTHER.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.287
WE MISS YOU. I MISS YOU.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.390
AND I WISH YOU COULD COME HOME.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.826
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.529
AND BY THE WAY,
IT'S MY EXPERIENCE

11:04.531 --> 11:08.033
THAT YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CHECK
BEFORE YOU PRESS "SEND."

11:08.035 --> 11:11.403
I DON'T THINK
YOU MEANT THIS FOR ME.

11:11.405 --> 11:14.606
MOM. THAT--
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

11:14.608 --> 11:16.274
I KNOW.

11:16.276 --> 11:19.144
HEY, I'M JUST HAPPY
THAT THROUGH ALL OF THIS

11:19.146 --> 11:20.845
YOU CAN STILL
THINK ABOUT BOYS.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.581
SO WHO IS IT?

11:23.583 --> 11:24.849
SOMEBODY I KNOW?

11:24.851 --> 11:28.453
NO, IT'S--
IT'S JUST SOMEBODY.

11:28.455 --> 11:31.222
REALLY? IT DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE JUST SOMEBODY.

11:31.224 --> 11:33.958
SO, WHAT COLOR
ARE THESE AMAZING EYES?

11:33.960 --> 11:36.394
I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE TO
START LOOKING IN THE HALLWAYS

11:36.396 --> 11:37.929
TO SEE IF I CAN
GUESS WHO IT IS.

11:37.931 --> 11:40.632
DON'T.
COUPLE OF MORE
SLIPS LIKE THAT TEXT

11:40.634 --> 11:42.133
AND I'LL KNOW
ALL ABOUT HIM.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.302
NO MORE SLIPS. PROMISE.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.004
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.707
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO FINDING OUT MORE.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.544
IT'S PRIVATE RIGHT NOW.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.445
OKAY?

11:59.453 --> 12:00.318
( beep )

12:01.722 --> 12:04.122
POOF. DELETED.
ALL GONE.

12:04.124 --> 12:07.192
IT'S JUST EVERYBODY'S
ENTITLED TO PRIVACY.

12:07.194 --> 12:10.295
IF YOU AND DAD
CAN HAVE SECRETS,
WHY CAN'T I?

12:10.297 --> 12:11.663
OKAY.

12:23.610 --> 12:27.479
<i> ¶ DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE</i>
<i> LIVING WITH A CURSE ¶</i>

12:27.481 --> 12:31.082
<i> ¶ ARE YOU MAKING IT WORSE? ¶</i>

12:31.084 --> 12:32.984
<i> ¶ CAN YOU TAKE ANY MORE? ¶</i>

12:35.789 --> 12:37.722
<i> ( song continues )</i>

12:42.562 --> 12:44.295
<i> ¶ ARE YOU GONNA GIVE ME</i>
<i> WHAT I'M ASKIN' FOR? ¶</i>

12:48.602 --> 12:51.803
<i> ¶ WHAT'S THE USE IN TRUSTING</i>

13:24.938 --> 13:26.604
GOD, I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

13:26.606 --> 13:30.308
YOU'VE GOT A COP CAR
ACROSS FROM YOUR HOUSE.

13:30.310 --> 13:34.012
WHERE?
I DIDN'T SEE IT.
DETECTIVES.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.614
TRUST ME, I KNOW EVERY
STOCK SEDAN IN TOWN.

13:36.616 --> 13:39.918
THEY USED TO ROTATE
IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.186
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:41.188 --> 13:43.588
THE POLICE
SEARCHED MY HOUSE.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.290
THEY TOOK THINGS
FROM MY ROOM.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.826
I'M A PERSON OF INTEREST.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.227
WHAT DO THEY THINK YOU DID?

13:50.730 --> 13:52.897
I THINK THEY THINK THAT...

13:55.268 --> 13:57.168
THEY THINK THAT I--

13:57.170 --> 13:59.070
THEY THINK<i> YOU</i>
HURT ALISON?

14:01.007 --> 14:03.508
THAT'S CRAZY.

14:03.510 --> 14:07.111
WELL, IT'S GOOD TO HEAR
SOMEBODY ELSE SAY THAT.

14:07.113 --> 14:09.047
YOU GOT ANY COFFEE MADE?

14:09.049 --> 14:11.783
YEAH, ALWAYS.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.918
PAPER CUPS?

14:13.920 --> 14:15.420
WHY PAPER CUPS?

14:15.422 --> 14:16.554
YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE COFFEE

14:16.556 --> 14:18.323
TO THOSE COPS
WATCHING YOUR HOUSE.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.358
WHY AM I GOING TO DO THAT?

14:20.360 --> 14:23.361
SO THEY'LL KNOW
YOU KNOW THEY'RE OUT THERE

14:23.363 --> 14:24.596
AND YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF THEM.

14:24.598 --> 14:27.198
YEAH, BUT I AM
KIND OF AFRAID.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.900
THEY DON'T KNOW THAT.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.641
TOBY..

14:36.643 --> 14:39.410
THE CAR THAT YOU
SAW ALISON GET IN
THE NIGHT THAT SHE WAS KILLED--

14:39.412 --> 14:41.512
I NEVER SAW THE DRIVER.
I TOLD YOU.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.348
I THINK THE DRIVER WAS IAN.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.383
YOU TELL THE COPS
WHAT YOU THINK?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.518
YEAH, I TOLD THEM.

14:47.520 --> 14:50.455
AND NOW I'M THE LITTLE GIRL
WHO CRIED IAN.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.856
THEY THINK
YOU LIED TO THEM.

14:51.858 --> 14:54.926
BIG DEAL. PEOPLE LIE
TO THE COPS ALL THE TIME.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.628
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

14:56.630 --> 14:59.097
IT'S A LOT OF THINGS
THAT ADD UP TO MAKE ME LOOK
REALLY SUSPICIOUS.

15:02.969 --> 15:05.637
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
KEEP AWAY FROM ME.

15:05.639 --> 15:08.172
PEOPLE CROSS THE STREET
WHEN THEY SEE ME COMING,

15:08.174 --> 15:10.675
AND THEY THINK YOU'RE TRYING
TO FRAME YOUR BROTHER-IN-LAW.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.611
WHO ELSE ARE WE
GONNA HANG OUT WITH?

15:30.697 --> 15:32.397
HEY.
HEY!

15:32.399 --> 15:35.600
I, UH, I SAW YOU TALKING
TO SEAN THE OTHER DAY.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.403
YEAH. HE'S NICE.
NICE.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.371
HE MAKES ME LAUGH.

15:40.373 --> 15:41.773
I KNOW IT MIGHT BE
KIND OF WEIRD,

15:41.775 --> 15:44.542
YOU BEING FRIENDS WITH HANNA
AND HANNA BEING HIS EX.

15:44.544 --> 15:47.312
THAT'S NOT REALLY
THE WEIRD PART, IS IT?

15:49.983 --> 15:52.583
SEAN ASKED ME ABOUT YOU.

15:52.585 --> 15:55.286
HE WANTED TO KNOW IF
YOU WERE SEEING ANYBODY.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.621
WHAT'D YOU TELL HIM?

15:56.623 --> 15:59.290
I TOLD HIM AS FAR AS I KNEW
YOU WEREN'T.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.492
I THINK HE WANTED ME
TO TALK HIM UP WITH YOU.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.595
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'S GONNA ASK YOU OUT.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.531
HE HAS.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.700
AND WHAT'D YOU SAY?

16:08.702 --> 16:10.068
I SAID YES.

16:11.905 --> 16:13.571
IT'S NOT REALLY A DATE.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.540
WE'RE GOING WITH
A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.275
NO BIG.
YEAH.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.889
YOU'RE NERVOUS
ABOUT THIS DINNER.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.691
YEAH,
I GUESS I AM.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.259
WELL,
THE IMPORTANT THING IS

16:35.261 --> 16:36.794
WE'LL GET PAST
ALL THE SNEAKING AROUND,

16:36.796 --> 16:38.863
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
WE WERE NOT THAT CLEVER,

16:38.865 --> 16:42.100
BECAUSE ARIA KNEW.
WHAT? WHEN?

16:42.102 --> 16:44.102
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT SHE DID.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.637
SHE ENDS UP WITH
ALL OF OUR SECRETS.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.639
AND NOW SHE WANTS
ONE OF HER OWN.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.476
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
SOME NEW ROMANCE.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.344
I FOUND OUT ABOUT IT
ACCIDENTALLY,

16:53.346 --> 16:56.581
AND I TEASED HER,
WHICH APPARENTLY WAS
THE WRONG THING TO DO.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.416
WHO'S THE BOY?
I DON'T KNOW.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.786
SHE WANTS TO
KEEP IT A SECRET FOR NOW,
WHICH I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.789
IS IT SOMEBODY AT SCHOOL?
PROBABLY.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.958
AREN'T YOU INTERESTED
IN WHO SHE'S DATING?

17:06.960 --> 17:08.259
OF COURSE I AM.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.029
AND WHEN SHE'S READY,
SHE'LL TELL US.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.864
WHAT?
WHAT IS THAT LOOK?

17:12.866 --> 17:16.167
IT'S THE LOOK OF SOMEBODY WHO
JUST HAD TO PICK UP HIS DAUGHTER

17:16.169 --> 17:18.569
AFTER SHE'D BEEN QUESTIONED
BY THE POLICE.

17:18.571 --> 17:19.904
AND YOU HAD
THE SAME LOOK.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.040
SHE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

17:22.042 --> 17:24.942
I'M JUST SAYING
WE NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT
MORE DILIGENT ABOUT THIS.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.345
YES, BUT DILIGENT
DOESN'T MEAN GRILLING HER

17:27.347 --> 17:29.514
ABOUT EVERY TEXT
SHE SENDS TO A BOY.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.315
WE HAVE TO TRUST HER.

17:31.317 --> 17:34.252
WELL, IT'S NOT ARIA
I DON'T TRUST.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.220
IT'S THE REST OF THE WORLD.

17:38.124 --> 17:40.024
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

17:41.461 --> 17:42.727
I THINK I DO.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.932
JUST HOLD ONTO THIS STUFF
FOR ME, OKAY?

17:47.934 --> 17:51.702
YOU DIDN'T MENTION EZRA'S NAME
IN THE TEXT, DID YOU?

17:51.704 --> 17:54.605
NO, NO.
BUT WHAT IF I HAD?

17:54.607 --> 17:58.543
I MEAN, IF I HAD MADE
ONE WRONG DETAIL IN THAT TEXT,

17:58.545 --> 18:00.011
MY MOM WOULD HAVE
FIGURED IT OUT

18:00.013 --> 18:03.147
AND EVERYTHING
WOULD HAVE BLOWN UP--
FOREVER.

18:03.149 --> 18:06.951
FRESH MANICURES
AND TINY KEYBOARDS--
A DEADLY COMBINATION.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.290
OUR FIRST COFFEE TOGETHER.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.196
THE NIGHT THAT
HE READ HIS SHORT STORY.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.967
OKAY, I'LL GIVE YOU
A CATALOGUE LATER.

18:22.969 --> 18:26.304
JUST...PUT THIS STUFF
IN YOUR LOCKER.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.873
DON'T WORRY.
THANKS.

18:28.875 --> 18:32.110
Caleb (distant):
HEY, STOP. LISTEN--

18:32.112 --> 18:34.312
LOOK AT THIS WAY--
WE BOTH MADE A MISTAKE.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.683
NO, I CAN'T DO IT
TONIGHT.

18:40.086 --> 18:43.721
I KNOW WHAT I SAID,
BUT IT'S DIFFERENT NOW.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.424
FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T THINK
SHE'S WHO YOU SAY SHE IS.

18:48.094 --> 18:50.261
DON'T CALL HER THAT.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.029
NO. I CAN'T DO IT TONIGHT.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.066
BECAUSE I<i> SAY</i> SO.

18:55.068 --> 18:58.436
BECAUSE I'M LIVING IN HER
HOUSE AND YOU KEEP CALLING--

18:58.438 --> 18:59.971
IT'S GOTTA STOP.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.440
OKAY, FINE. LATER.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.574
<i> LATER.</i>

19:19.058 --> 19:20.291
YOU GOT IT WRONG.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.059
WE HEARD WHAT WE HEARD,
HANNA.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.428
NO, YOU HEARD WHAT YOU HEARD,
BUT YOU GOT IT WRONG.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.097
HE WAS TALKING
TO ANOTHER GIRL,

19:26.099 --> 19:27.632
AND THERE WAS
A LOT OF HISTORY.
YOU COULD TELL.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.100
WHAT HAPPENED TO BEING
ALL HAPPY FOR HANNA?

19:29.102 --> 19:31.669
WHERE'D ALL THAT GO?
WE WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY--

19:31.671 --> 19:35.640
THEN YOU SHOULDN'T
TELL ME THIS,
BECAUSE IT'S NOT TRUE.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.542
NOT AFTER WE...

19:39.112 --> 19:40.945
YOU JUST--
YOU HEARD WRONG.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.014
HE COULD HAVE BEEN ON THE PHONE
WITH HIS FOSTER PARENTS
OR SOMETHING,

19:43.016 --> 19:45.216
OR HIS SOCIAL WORKER.
YOU DON'T KNOW.

19:45.218 --> 19:48.419
OKAY, MAYBE WE DIDN'T
HEAR IT RIGHT.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.688
HANNA, WE HEARD
WHAT CALEB SAID,

19:50.690 --> 19:52.356
AND YOU HAVE TO
KNOW THE TRUTH.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.960
I THINK HE'S WITH SOMEONE ELSE
AND HASN'T TOLD YOU.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.795
NO, CALEB HAS
TOLD ME EVERYTHING,

19:57.797 --> 19:59.363
AND I TOLD HIM
EVERYTHING.

20:02.101 --> 20:05.836
NOT<i> EVERYTHING,</i>
BUT I TOLD HIM
ALL ABOUT ME.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.139
AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,
IT'S NOT HIM.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.911
IT CAN'T BE.

20:13.913 --> 20:17.848
OKAY, GUYS,
MAYBE WE ARE BEING
A LITTLE BIT PARANOID.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.850
YOU KNOW, WITH ALL
THAT'S GOING ON,

20:19.852 --> 20:21.319
WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS
TOO CLOSELY,

20:21.321 --> 20:24.155
WE'RE GETTING THESE DETAILS,
BUT CAN'T SEE THE BIG PICTURE.

20:24.157 --> 20:26.424
GUYS.

20:26.426 --> 20:28.426
( cane tapping on floor )

20:59.158 --> 21:00.558
CALEB'S NOT PICKING UP.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.660
SHE'S GONNA
SEND HIM A TEXT.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.095
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON?

21:04.097 --> 21:06.097
EITHER IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE,

21:06.099 --> 21:08.499
WHICH IS BAD ENOUGH,
OR IT'S SOMETHING WORSE.

21:08.501 --> 21:11.636
COULDN'T IT JUST BE
TWO PENDANTS THAT LOOK ALIKE?

21:11.638 --> 21:13.371
DREAM ON.

21:15.008 --> 21:18.843
IF CALEB HURTS HANNA,
HE'S A DEAD MAN.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.678
NOT LITERALLY. I MEAN--

21:22.048 --> 21:22.947
I GOTTA GO.

21:29.922 --> 21:33.124
Girl:
IMPRESSIVE! SEAN ACKARD.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.892
SCORE FOR PAIGE.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.161
HE ASKED ME,
AND I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE FUN.

21:37.163 --> 21:39.263
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA HIBERNATE
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR,

21:39.265 --> 21:41.265
BUT YOU DRAGGED HIM
OUT OF THE CAVE.

21:41.267 --> 21:42.533
NICE WORK.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.626
Emily:
<i> PASSING HER INFORMATION?</i>

22:42.628 --> 22:44.261
WHAT KIND OF
INFORMATION?

22:44.263 --> 22:45.896
WHAT WAS ON
THE FLASH DRIVE?

22:45.898 --> 22:48.165
I COULDN'T SEE,
BUT IT COULD HAVE
BEEN ANYTHING.

22:48.167 --> 22:49.233
ANYTHING?

22:49.235 --> 22:51.635
ANYTHING FROM
HANNA'S COMPUTER,
I GUESS.

22:51.637 --> 22:53.037
CALEB THE HACKER.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.905
IS THAT WHO TOBY HEARD
JENNA TALKING TO

22:54.907 --> 22:56.240
WHEN SHE WROTE DOWN
THE NUMBER?

22:56.242 --> 22:58.876
WAIT. 2-1-4 HAS TO DO
WITH CALEB?

22:58.878 --> 23:00.644
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING, RIGHT?

23:00.646 --> 23:02.713
THAT JENNA PLUS CALAB
EQUALS "A."

23:02.715 --> 23:05.216
NO! HE CAN'T BE
DOING THIS.

23:05.218 --> 23:08.252
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT CAN'T BE THIS.
AND IT CAN'T BE HER.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.020
HANNA, NO ONE
WANTS THIS TO BE TRUE.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.523
HAS HE CALLED YOU BACK?
NOT YET.

23:12.525 --> 23:16.460
AND NOBODY'S SEEN HIM IN SCHOOL
SINCE THIS MORNING.

23:16.462 --> 23:19.697
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
THIS WOULD MEAN IF IT'S TRUE.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.632
HANNA, WE DO KNOW.

23:28.207 --> 23:29.407
WAIT. HANNA--

23:29.409 --> 23:31.675
WAIT. SPENCE...DON'T.

24:01.607 --> 24:02.773
TWO...

24:04.444 --> 24:05.643
ONE...

24:09.315 --> 24:10.581
FOUR.

24:22.428 --> 24:23.828
Hanna:<i> MONEY?</i>

24:23.830 --> 24:25.396
YOU DID THIS FOR MONEY?

24:25.398 --> 24:27.331
SHE KNEW I WAS A HACKER.
SHE ASKED ME ABOUT HER PHONE.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.300
THE PHONE YOU COULDN'T CRACK,
WAS THAT A LIE TOO?

24:29.302 --> 24:31.735
JENNA FOUND OUT THAT
I DID WORK ON EMILY'S PHONE.

24:31.737 --> 24:35.306
SHE OFFERED ME CASH
TO MAKE MYSELF AVAILABLE
TO YOU AND LISTEN.

24:35.308 --> 24:38.976
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST
SOME GENERIC BITCHINESS
WITH ALL THE PRETTY GIRLS.

24:38.978 --> 24:42.313
WHY SHOULDN'T I
MAKE A COUPLE OF BUCKS?
YOU ARE SUCH A CREEP.

24:42.315 --> 24:43.781
WAIT.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.816
THEN SHE STARTED
ASKING QUESTIONS,

24:45.818 --> 24:47.818
QUESTIONS THAT
I DIDN'T LIKE.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.087
AND BY THEN...

24:50.089 --> 24:53.424
OTHER THINGS WERE HAPPENING...
WITH YOU AND ME.

24:53.426 --> 24:56.460
YOU WERE SPYING ON ME
THE WHOLE TIME.

24:56.462 --> 24:57.695
NO, NOT THE WHOLE TIME.

24:57.697 --> 24:59.396
YOU GAVE HER
YOUR LOCKER COMBINATION!

24:59.398 --> 25:01.198
THAT'S HOW SHE GAVE ME
THE FLASH DRIVE.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.867
WHAT WAS ON IT
WHEN SHE GOT IT BACK?

25:02.869 --> 25:07.204
JUNK. SHE THINKS IT'S THE LOG
OFF YOUR CELL PHONE,
BUT IT'S NOT.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.005
NO--

25:08.007 --> 25:09.106
DON'T TOUCH ME.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.508
( door slams )

25:52.618 --> 25:54.485
POOR HANNA.

25:55.688 --> 25:57.521
I'M SORRY.

25:57.523 --> 26:00.024
WHY? YOU DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.859
I'M PART OF WHAT
HAPPENED TO HER--

26:01.861 --> 26:04.061
WHAT'S HAPPENING
TO ALL OF YOU.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.564
IT'S THE OTHER WAY
AROUND, TOBY.

26:06.566 --> 26:08.098
WE HAPPENED TO YOU.

26:09.569 --> 26:11.936
( music plays softly
in background )

26:19.412 --> 26:21.612
WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO RUN AWAY?

26:22.915 --> 26:24.582
COLD.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.653
DIDN'T YOU EVER
RUN AWAY?

26:29.655 --> 26:33.090
ONCE.
I THINK I WAS SEVEN.

26:33.092 --> 26:36.427
MY SISTER AND I HAD
AN ARGUMENT OVER SOMETHING,

26:36.429 --> 26:40.264
AND MY PARENTS
TOOK MELISSA'S SIDE.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.434
WHAT WERE YOU
FIGHTING ABOUT?

26:43.436 --> 26:49.173
SOME GREAT INJUSTICE
I CAN'T REMEMBER NOW.

26:49.175 --> 26:51.642
BUT THEY SIDED WITH HER,

26:51.644 --> 26:56.146
SO I MADE
A TUNA SALAD SANDWICH,
AND I RAN AWAY.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.983
AND WHERE DID YOU GO?

26:58.985 --> 27:00.818
THE MOVIES.

27:02.188 --> 27:05.222
IT WAS SOMETHING
ANIMATED.

27:05.224 --> 27:08.759
THERE WAS A PRINCESS,
AND EVERYBODY WAS SINGING.

27:12.832 --> 27:15.532
THEN I GOT LONELY.

27:15.534 --> 27:18.235
AND I ATE
MY TUNA SALAD SANDWICH

27:18.237 --> 27:20.137
AND I CAME HOME.

27:21.807 --> 27:25.609
WERE YOUR PARENTS WORRIED?

27:25.611 --> 27:27.745
THEY HADN'T EVEN NOTICED
I WAS GONE.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.952
DO ME A FAVOR.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.754
WHAT?

27:36.756 --> 27:41.625
IF YOU EVER GET THE URGE
TO RUN AWAY AGAIN...

27:41.627 --> 27:43.994
CALL ME FIRST, OKAY?

27:47.333 --> 27:48.465
OKAY.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.971
Ella: BYRON...

28:27.973 --> 28:29.273
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

28:29.275 --> 28:30.841
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

28:30.843 --> 28:34.278
IF SHE FINDS OUT
YOU'RE SPYING ON HER,
SHE'LL BE FURIOUS.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.879
I'M NOT SPYING.

28:35.881 --> 28:39.216
I'M JUST STANDING IN
OUR DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.385
WE AGREED LONG AGO
THAT WE WEREN'T GONNA BE

28:41.387 --> 28:43.287
THOSE PARENTS
THAT POKE AND PRY.

28:43.289 --> 28:45.589
YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT
THOSE PARENTS WHO WORRY?

28:45.591 --> 28:48.258
AND WHAT IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO HER?
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL?

28:48.260 --> 28:50.828
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
LIFE ISN'T FAIR.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.396
IF SHE'S KEEPING SECRETS,

28:52.398 --> 28:55.099
IT'S BECAUSE
SHE LEARNED IT FROM US.

28:55.101 --> 28:57.101
MEANING WHAT?

28:57.103 --> 28:58.502
MEANING EXACTLY
WHAT I SAID.

28:58.504 --> 29:01.004
IF THERE ARE PARTS OF HER LIFE
THAT SHE WANTS PRIVATE,

29:01.006 --> 29:02.439
IT'S BECAUSE
WE TAUGHT HER TO DO THAT.

29:02.441 --> 29:04.875
YOU MEAN I DID.
I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THAT.

29:04.877 --> 29:07.511
YEAH, BUT IT'S STILL THERE,
ISN'T IT?

29:07.513 --> 29:09.146
YEAH. IT IS.

29:09.148 --> 29:11.048
I THOUGHT
WE WERE PAST THAT.

29:11.050 --> 29:13.383
WE'RE NOT PAST IT.
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND
A WAY AROUND IT,

29:13.385 --> 29:15.252
BUT WE REALLY HAVEN'T
DEALT WITH IT.

29:15.254 --> 29:19.123
OKAY, FINE. CAN WE JUST
KEEP THIS ABOUT ARIA
AND THIS UNKNOWN BOY?

29:19.125 --> 29:20.958
CAN WE DO THAT?
I DON'T KNOW, CAN WE?

29:20.960 --> 29:23.694
IS THAT REALLY WHAT
THIS ARGUMENT IS ALL ABOUT?
I'M NOT ARGUING.

29:23.696 --> 29:26.296
BYRON, YOU CAN'T EVEN AGREE
WITH ME THAT WE ARE FIGHTING.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.865
WE'RE N--

29:27.867 --> 29:29.833
HEY, MIKE.

29:29.835 --> 29:32.035
DID YOU JUST GET HOME?

29:37.777 --> 29:40.811
I CALLED HER.
SHE DIDN'T PICK UP.

29:40.813 --> 29:42.346
DID SHE TALK TO YOU?

29:42.348 --> 29:44.047
RADIO SILENCE.

29:44.049 --> 29:45.849
POOR HANNA.

29:45.851 --> 29:48.752
WHY DO YOU THINK
JENNA TOLD CALEB
TO GO AFTER HER?

29:48.754 --> 29:51.455
BECAUSE SHE WAS THE ONE
WHO WASN'T SEEING ANYBODY.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.891
TARGET OF CONVENIENCE.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.159
( laughter )

29:56.796 --> 29:59.997
I SHOULD JUST PICK A BOY,
SOMEONE NICE,

29:59.999 --> 30:01.832
AND JUST TELL MY MOM THAT
THAT'S WHO I WAS TEXTING.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.801
THAT'D BE
THE SIMPLE SOLUTION.

30:03.803 --> 30:05.936
THERE'S NOTHING SIMPLE
ABOUT LYING.

30:07.807 --> 30:11.575
I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.
I MEANT LYING IN GENERAL.

30:13.279 --> 30:15.112
OKAY.
IF YOU SAY SO.

30:21.520 --> 30:25.422
YOU'VE GOT A GOOD SHOT
AT HAVING THE SEARCH WARRANT
THROWN OUT.

30:25.424 --> 30:28.358
JUDGE ENWRIGHT IS
A NOTORIOUS RUBBER STAMP,

30:28.360 --> 30:29.760
AND HE PROBABLY
DIDN'T EVEN READ IT.

30:29.762 --> 30:32.696
SO...WHATEVER THEY FIND,
WE CAN GET TOSSED OUT.

30:32.698 --> 30:35.666
WHY ARE THEY
SEARCHING<i> MY</i> ROOM?

30:35.668 --> 30:37.768
WHAT MAKES ME SO SPECIAL?

30:37.770 --> 30:40.804
POLICE THINKING
IS LIKE WATER.

30:40.806 --> 30:43.907
IT RUNS DOWNHILL AND TRAVELS
THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTENCE.

30:43.909 --> 30:48.111
SO WHEN THEY FOUND OUT THAT
YOU AND IAN WERE ONCE INVOLVED,

30:48.113 --> 30:50.981
YOU WENT TO
THE TOP OF THEIR LIST.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.350
I COULD NEVER HURT ALISON.

30:53.352 --> 30:56.420
SHE MADE ME FURIOUS
SOMETIMES, BUT...

30:56.422 --> 30:57.855
BUT I WOULD NEVER HURT HER.

30:57.857 --> 31:00.490
HONEY, I KNOW YOU DIDN'T DO
WHAT THEY THINK YOU DID.

31:00.492 --> 31:03.727
YOU COULDN'T. WE'RE GONNA
GET THIS BEHIND US,

31:03.729 --> 31:06.930
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO MOVE AHEAD--

31:06.932 --> 31:08.966
ALL OF US, AS A FAMILY.

31:11.136 --> 31:12.569
COME DOWNSTAIRS?

31:12.571 --> 31:14.438
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

31:25.284 --> 31:28.452
WHERE WERE YOU
ALL MORNING?

31:28.454 --> 31:29.419
WALKING.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.789
JUST WALKING.

31:32.791 --> 31:35.259
SO IT'S TRUE?

31:35.261 --> 31:37.728
YEAH. IT'S ALL TRUE.

31:39.865 --> 31:41.031
WHERE'S SPENCER?

31:41.033 --> 31:43.133
OH, SHE STAYED HOME.

31:49.742 --> 31:50.607
COME ON.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.010
Aria (whispers):
HANNA.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.247
I JUST WANT TO
TALK TO HER.

32:03.289 --> 32:04.488
HELLO?

32:11.797 --> 32:12.796
YES?

32:38.457 --> 32:41.224
THIS IS HANNA.

32:41.226 --> 32:43.260
IN CASE YOU COULDN'T GUESS.

32:53.672 --> 32:56.039
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO MOM AND DAD?

32:56.041 --> 32:58.775
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.610
THEY WERE GETTING ALONG,
AND I CAME HOME

33:00.612 --> 33:02.913
AND FIND THEM
FIGHTING IN YOUR ROOM.
ABOUT WHAT?

33:02.915 --> 33:04.915
ABOUT SOME BOY
THEY DON'T LIKE.

33:04.917 --> 33:07.617
DUMP HIM.
OR JUST<i> SAY</i> YOU'LL DUMP HIM.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.419
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

33:09.421 --> 33:10.721
LIE TO THEM, OKAY?

33:10.723 --> 33:12.456
YOU USED TO DO IT
ALL THE TIME.

33:12.458 --> 33:13.557
TELL THEM WHAT
THEY WANT TO KNOW,

33:13.559 --> 33:15.225
EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO
MAKE IT UP.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.794
HEY, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,
ALL RIGHT?

33:17.796 --> 33:20.564
WE'RE GONNA GO DOWNSTAIRS,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE DINNER,

33:20.566 --> 33:22.032
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT
MOM COMING BACK,

33:22.034 --> 33:24.234
AND EVERYTHING'S
GONNA GO BACK TO NORMAL.

33:24.236 --> 33:25.202
OKAY?

33:26.372 --> 33:27.804
IT BETTER.

33:38.283 --> 33:40.083
CHANGE OF PLANS.

33:40.085 --> 33:43.387
YOUR MOM HAS CALLED.
SHE'S, UH, NOT FEELING WELL.

33:43.389 --> 33:45.422
IS SHE SICK?

33:45.424 --> 33:48.592
NO, SHE'S JUST
NOT UP TO IT TONIGHT.

33:48.594 --> 33:50.994
WE'LL DO IT ANOTHER TIME.
SOON.

33:50.996 --> 33:54.064
COME ON. EVERYTHING
SMELLS SO GREAT

33:54.066 --> 33:56.933
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT
YOU GUYS CAME UP WITH.

34:03.242 --> 34:04.441
<i> ( cell phone beeps )</i>

34:23.495 --> 34:25.162
Ian: YOU KNOW, THEY WERE
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

34:25.164 --> 34:27.898
THEY THOUGHT YOU
MIGHT HAVE RUN AWAY.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.834
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR CONCERN.

34:30.836 --> 34:34.471
I THINK I'D UNDERSTAND
IF YOU DID, THOUGH.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.006
YOU KNOW, RUN AWAY.

34:36.008 --> 34:37.841
YOU KNOW WHAT
I DON'T NEED, IAN?

34:37.843 --> 34:39.810
I DON'T NEED
YOUR UNDERSTANDING.

34:39.812 --> 34:42.746
WELL, WE'RE FAMILY.
WE SHOULD ACT LIKE ONE.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.714
FAMILY
PROTECTS ITSELF.

34:44.716 --> 34:47.617
I THOUGHT YOU
HAD TO PROTECT MELISSA
AND YOUR BUNDLE OF JOY.

34:47.619 --> 34:50.287
I DO...
AND I WILL.

34:50.289 --> 34:54.191
BUT RIGHT NOW THERE'S STILL
A WINDOW OF PROTECTION
LEFT OPEN FOR YOU.

34:54.193 --> 34:56.393
WE JUST NEED TO BE
HONEST WITH EACH OTHER.

34:59.631 --> 35:03.166
YOU WANT TO HELP ME
RUN AWAY, DON'T YOU?

35:03.168 --> 35:06.069
OH, THAT WOULD BE
GREAT FOR YOU.

35:06.071 --> 35:09.072
"SHE RAN AWAY,
SHE<i> MUST</i> BE GUILTY."

35:09.074 --> 35:12.709
IF I DISAPPEARED,
THAT WOULD JUST CLEAN UP
EVERYTHING FOR YOU, WOULDN'T IT?

35:12.711 --> 35:15.512
TIME'S RUNNING OUT FOR YOU,
SPENCER.

35:15.514 --> 35:19.015
YOU SHOULD TAKE
THE HELP THAT'S OFFERED--
WHEREVER IT COMES FROM.

35:19.017 --> 35:23.253
BECAUSE WHEN THEY ARREST YOU...

35:23.255 --> 35:25.589
IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

35:39.972 --> 35:42.005
NICE ROOM.

35:42.007 --> 35:43.940
THANKS.

35:43.942 --> 35:47.477
WINDOW SEAT.
I ALWAYS WANTED A ROOM
WITH ONE OF THOSE.

35:50.048 --> 35:52.249
YOU HAD YOUR DATE
WITH SEAN?

35:54.019 --> 35:55.452
YEAH.

35:55.454 --> 35:57.854
THAT'S WHERE I WAS TONIGHT.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.323
HOW'D IT GO?
GREAT.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.759
GOOD. HE'S A NICE GUY.

36:05.430 --> 36:07.430
YEAH, IT WENT OKAY.

36:07.432 --> 36:09.900
GOOD.

36:09.902 --> 36:11.401
YEAH.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.737
UNTIL HE KISSED ME.

36:15.741 --> 36:20.110
HE TOOK ME HOME
AND KISSED ME GOODNIGHT.

36:20.112 --> 36:22.212
AND...

36:22.214 --> 36:24.047
I DON'T KNOW,

36:24.049 --> 36:27.584
THE DATE, THE WHOLE NIGHT,
JUST FELT...

36:27.586 --> 36:31.154
PHONY ALL OF A SUDDEN,
LIKE IT WASN'T ME--

36:31.156 --> 36:34.324
IT WAS SOMEBODY
I WAS WATCHING,
BUT NOT ME.

36:37.162 --> 36:38.895
HE WENT HOME,
AND I TEXTED YOU.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.134
SEAN'S A NICE GUY,

36:44.136 --> 36:47.637
AND IF HE'S INTERESTED IN YOU
AS MORE THAN A FRIEND,

36:47.639 --> 36:49.706
YOU HAVE TO BE
HONEST WITH HIM.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.641
YOU'RE SAYING
I SHOULD DUMP HIM?

36:51.643 --> 36:54.678
I'M SAYING YOU
SHOULDN'T LEAD HIM ON,

36:54.680 --> 36:56.713
YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.282
THAT IS SO EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

36:59.284 --> 37:00.817
YOU'RE FEARLESS.

37:00.819 --> 37:04.387
I AM SO NOT FEARLESS.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.289
YOU CAME OUT.

37:06.291 --> 37:09.659
I DIDN'T COME OUT
OF THE CLOSET.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.761
I FELL OUT--
ON MY FACE.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.532
BUT I'M OUT.

37:15.534 --> 37:18.535
AND WHATEVER ELSE HAPPENS,
I DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

37:24.243 --> 37:27.644
IF I SAY IT OUT LOUD...

37:27.646 --> 37:30.780
IF I SAY...

37:30.782 --> 37:34.184
"I'M GAY"...

37:34.186 --> 37:37.487
THE WHOLE WORLD
IS GONNA CHANGE.

37:37.489 --> 37:40.056
YEAH. IT WILL.

37:55.207 --> 37:57.040
YOU WANT TO HEAR
SOMETHING FUNNY?

37:57.042 --> 37:59.776
I WOULD<i> LOVE</i> TO HEAR
SOMETHING FUNNY.

37:59.778 --> 38:05.682
WHEN I WAS TRYING TO
TALK MYSELF INTO BEING
INTERESTED IN BOYS,

38:05.684 --> 38:08.618
I WOULD LOOK
FOR GUYS LIKE YOU.

38:11.857 --> 38:14.124
LIKE ME HOW?

38:14.126 --> 38:18.762
THE KIND THAT WOULD
PULL ME UP ON STAGE
AND GET ME TO SING.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.233
BECAUSE I WOULD NEVER
DO THAT ON MY OWN.

38:47.359 --> 38:48.892
( sobbing )

38:58.737 --> 38:59.869
HANNA?

39:01.473 --> 39:02.372
YEAH?

39:04.443 --> 39:07.777
CALEB'S THINGS ARE GONE
FROM THE GUEST ROOM.

39:07.779 --> 39:09.112
HE LEFT.

39:10.816 --> 39:13.416
CAN I COME IN?
NOT RIGHT NOW,

39:13.418 --> 39:14.951
I'M GONNA TAKE A BATH.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.867
<i> ¶ DRAWING A CIRCLE ¶</i>

39:30.869 --> 39:33.403
<i> ¶ 'ROUND A STRAIGHT LINE ¶</i>

39:35.841 --> 39:38.408
<i> ¶ MY HEAVY HEART... ¶</i>

39:41.980 --> 39:44.147
I'M SORRY, HONEY.
IT'S ME.

39:44.149 --> 39:47.851
DID YOU JUST GET HOME?

39:47.853 --> 39:49.452
( sighs )
YEAH.

39:49.454 --> 39:52.956
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

39:52.958 --> 39:54.624
I WAS RIGHT.

39:54.626 --> 39:57.827
WE'VE GOT A SHOT AT HAVING
THE SEARCH WARRANT THROWN OUT.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.496
THAT'S GOOD.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.030
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD,

40:01.032 --> 40:04.868
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING
FOR THEM TO FIND.

40:04.870 --> 40:07.470
THEY DID FIND SOMETHING.

40:10.442 --> 40:12.075
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

40:12.077 --> 40:13.977
I GOT THIS BACK CHANNEL.

40:13.979 --> 40:15.545
THEY FOUND SOME FIBERS,

40:15.547 --> 40:17.847
SOME THREADS
CAUGHT IN A BRACELET--

40:17.849 --> 40:19.182
THAT NAME BRACELET
OF YOURS.

40:19.184 --> 40:21.017
THE ONE ALISON GAVE US?

40:22.988 --> 40:24.854
THE THREADS
MATCH THE SWEATER

40:24.856 --> 40:26.923
THAT THEY FOUND
IN TOBY'S CLOSET,

40:26.925 --> 40:29.459
THE ONE WITH
THE BLOOD STAINS.

40:31.530 --> 40:35.732
I HAVE TO ASK YOU--
DID YOU HAVE THAT SWEATER?

40:35.734 --> 40:37.700
DID YOU PLANT IT
IN TOBY'S HOUSE?
NO!

40:37.702 --> 40:41.371
THAT'S THE SWEATER
ALISON WAS WEARING
THE NIGHT SHE DIED.

40:41.373 --> 40:43.006
HOW COULD I HAVE
THAT SWEATER?

40:43.008 --> 40:45.275
I GUESS THE THEORY IS THAT
SHE GAVE IT TO YOU THAT NIGHT,

40:45.277 --> 40:47.577
OR YOU TOOK IT FROM HER.
I<i> TOOK</i> IT FROM HER?

40:47.579 --> 40:50.413
YOU MEAN LIKE AFTER SHE--

40:50.415 --> 40:53.450
INSIDE THEIR MINDS,
IT MAKES SENSE.

40:53.452 --> 40:56.653
WHAT ABOUT IN YOUR MIND?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

40:56.655 --> 41:00.890
I THINK SOMEONE'S GOING
TO A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE
TO MAKE YOU LOOK GUILTY.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.396
( crying )
MOM.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.201
IT'S OKAY.
