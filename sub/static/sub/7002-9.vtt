WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:03.068
Guys, what are you doing?
We're watching the game.

00:03.069 --> 00:06.137
We're playing sumo wrestlers.
You can't be
watching the game

00:06.138 --> 00:08.372
And playing sumo wrestlers
at the same time.

00:08.373 --> 00:11.977
Yes, we can.
We're gifted.

00:11.978 --> 00:14.946
And I am so proud.
Now take it outside.

00:14.947 --> 00:17.649
Come on, pass the ball,
pass the ball,
pass the ball!

00:17.650 --> 00:21.452
Yes! But not to
the other team, you idiot!

00:21.453 --> 00:23.655
Oh, come on. Not now,
I'm listening to the game.
Come on.

00:23.656 --> 00:25.757
No. I want you to look
at some of this stuff.
Oh, come on.

00:25.758 --> 00:27.993
It's tied, and the wolverines
need me. Please? Please?

00:27.994 --> 00:30.361
No, I need you. Come on,
you can miss an inning.

00:30.362 --> 00:32.463
Inning?

00:32.464 --> 00:35.199
Why do you always bug me
during the football game?

00:35.200 --> 00:37.769
Did I bug you
during childbirth?

00:37.770 --> 00:39.804
No, but you bugged me
during conception.

00:41.674 --> 00:43.307
There, see?
It's a commercial.

00:43.308 --> 00:45.343
You can talk to me.
All right. You got
two minutes. Hurry up.

00:45.344 --> 00:47.779
You know, these are
bits and pieces of wills

00:47.780 --> 00:50.314
That we started
and never finished.

00:50.315 --> 00:52.450
The will? That again?
Didn't we just do this?

00:52.451 --> 00:55.520
Yeah, this is real recent.
"in the event
that we have children."

00:57.757 --> 01:00.125
You see, I think
you're avoiding this again.

01:00.126 --> 01:02.593
Every time we go to make
an appointment with the lawyer,
we end up canceling it,

01:02.594 --> 01:05.495
Usually because
you come up with some
bizarre physical ailment.

01:05.497 --> 01:08.933
Do not.
Last time we didn't go
because your hair hurt.

01:08.934 --> 01:12.270
It tightens up on me
every so often.
Ooh, game's on.

01:12.271 --> 01:14.272
Tim, I'm gonna
make an appointment
with the lawyer.

01:14.273 --> 01:16.541
If you're even
thinking about getting sick,
go see a doctor.

01:16.542 --> 01:18.609
Honey, I'm healthy
as a horse.

01:18.610 --> 01:21.312
Then see a veterinarian.

01:21.313 --> 01:24.482
When was the last time that
you had a complete physical?

01:24.483 --> 01:27.719
Honey, I...
I go to the doctor
all the time.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.155
I'm not talking about
the emergency room.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.161
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

02:49.168 --> 02:50.835
One,

02:50.836 --> 02:52.070
Two,

02:52.071 --> 02:53.571
Three.

02:56.308 --> 02:59.010
Yes, it works.
That was awesome.

02:59.011 --> 03:02.113
I bet if we both jumped on it,
we could get twice the power.

03:02.114 --> 03:03.714
Yeah.

03:03.715 --> 03:06.350
What else can we shoot
across the yard?

03:06.351 --> 03:08.019
Hi, guys.

03:09.121 --> 03:11.856
Hey, mark.
Come here.

03:13.625 --> 03:16.427
Have you ever
played rocket man?

03:16.428 --> 03:19.563
You wanna play with me?
Well, yeah.

03:19.564 --> 03:21.299
And guess what.
What?

03:21.300 --> 03:23.201
You're gonna
be the rocket.
Cool.

03:23.202 --> 03:26.237
Now you just stand there
and wait.

03:26.238 --> 03:29.540
And you might wanna
put your hands out
like superman.

03:29.541 --> 03:32.710
Like this?
Yeah, that's perfect.

03:32.711 --> 03:34.512
One, two...

03:34.513 --> 03:35.680
Wait! Hold it there!

03:35.681 --> 03:38.749
But, mom,
I'm gonna fly.

03:38.750 --> 03:41.019
This flight is grounded.
Mark, you go inside.

03:41.020 --> 03:42.720
You two, you just stay
right where you are.

03:42.721 --> 03:45.290
Don't even
think about moving.

03:46.692 --> 03:49.227
But, mom, they wanted
to play with me.

03:49.228 --> 03:53.097
Mark, when brad and randy
say they wanna play with you,
always ask yourself,

03:53.098 --> 03:56.534
"what do they
want to <i>do</i> to me?"

03:56.535 --> 03:58.636
Ok. Hi, dad.

03:58.637 --> 04:02.273
Hello, my lucky little offspring
and my even luckier wife.

04:02.274 --> 04:04.876
Well, you're in a zippy mood.

04:04.877 --> 04:08.746
Well, I took your advice.
Saw dr. Brody today,
got a complete physical.

04:08.747 --> 04:10.414
Really?

04:10.415 --> 04:15.019
He said I'm fitter
than a greek god.

04:15.020 --> 04:17.055
Just call me baklava.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.327
As a matter of fact,
he was so impressed,

04:22.328 --> 04:24.562
He wanted to know if he could
frame my chest x-rays

04:24.563 --> 04:27.631
And hang them
in the waiting room.

04:27.632 --> 04:30.401
Good thing he's not
a proctologist.

04:32.271 --> 04:35.206
What are you doing?
Working on the will.

04:35.207 --> 04:37.541
I told you I was healthy.
We don't need to do this now.

04:37.542 --> 04:40.245
You don't have to do it.
I'm doing it.

04:40.246 --> 04:44.482
This first part is just about
listing your personal assets.

04:44.483 --> 04:48.353
I'm not doing this.
You don't have to do it.
I told you, I'm doing it.

04:48.354 --> 04:52.456
"upon your death,
how and to whom do you want
your assets to be distributed?"

04:52.457 --> 04:55.426
Why are we always
talking about my death?
Let's talk about your death.

04:55.427 --> 04:59.597
Statistics show
it's much more common
for the man to die first.

04:59.598 --> 05:02.000
Yeah? Well, look what
we have to live with.

05:04.836 --> 05:09.073
And it's remarks like that
that lead to those early deaths.

05:09.074 --> 05:12.710
Now, let me see...
Tim's tools... Go to
his brother steve.

05:12.711 --> 05:15.046
No. No, no! No! They don't
go to steve. Don't...

05:15.047 --> 05:17.081
I thought you
weren't participating.

05:17.082 --> 05:20.418
I'm not participating.
My tools are mine.
They don't go with anybody.

05:20.419 --> 05:22.720
I want to be
buried with them.
Oh, no.

05:22.721 --> 05:26.457
You're not being buried.
I'm having you cremated.

05:26.458 --> 05:30.428
No, you're not. Put me
in some stupid urn up here on
the bookcase? Forget about it.

05:30.429 --> 05:32.463
No, I'm not gonna do that.

05:32.464 --> 05:34.632
I'm gonna put you
in a mayonnaise jar
behind the wing nuts.

05:38.304 --> 05:40.771
Rinse it out before
you pour me in it.

05:40.772 --> 05:43.641
There is something that
we do have to talk about,

05:43.642 --> 05:46.677
And that is who is gonna
get the kids if we both die.

05:46.678 --> 05:48.046
Wedgie patrol!

05:48.047 --> 05:51.382
Hey! Come on.
No wedgie patrol.

05:51.383 --> 05:55.820
Why wait till we're dead?
Won't somebody take them now?

05:55.821 --> 05:59.123
No, really,
I'm serious about this.
What about one of my sisters?

05:59.124 --> 06:01.359
You know, katie or robin
would take them.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.195
If we gotta give them away,
give them to my brother jeff.
The boys love jeff.

06:04.196 --> 06:06.030
Of course they do,

06:06.031 --> 06:08.866
He's the only
human being who can belch
"the star-spangled banner."

06:08.867 --> 06:11.336
No, look. Let's just...
We'll just talk about
this part later.

06:11.337 --> 06:14.472
We'll go back to
the other thing. You know,
we don't have to itemize.

06:14.473 --> 06:16.607
It basically - it just says that
if I die, you get everything,

06:16.608 --> 06:18.676
And if you die,
I get everything.

06:18.677 --> 06:21.545
My stuff's so much cooler
than your stuff.

06:21.546 --> 06:23.914
If you die,
what do I end up with?

06:23.915 --> 06:26.784
That weird little
pig oven mitt
and that blender.

06:26.785 --> 06:29.954
If I die, you get
the binford 18-piece
chisel and punch set.

06:29.955 --> 06:32.290
Oh, well, now you see why

06:32.291 --> 06:34.392
I'm so desperate
to get this down on paper.

06:34.393 --> 06:36.294
But let's say I die

06:36.295 --> 06:39.297
And you remarry
a young stud named paco
who's a bullfighter in mexico.

06:39.298 --> 06:40.331
Then what happens?

06:40.332 --> 06:42.233
I learn spanish.

06:45.637 --> 06:49.340
Anyway, before we say goodbye,
al's got a little project
he'd like to talk about.

06:49.341 --> 06:50.741
That's right, tim.

06:50.742 --> 06:53.978
I've recently bought land
up near houghton lake.

06:53.979 --> 06:55.813
I'm building
my own log cabin.

06:55.814 --> 07:00.485
<i>(grunts/makes</i>
<i>monkey noises)</i>

07:00.486 --> 07:03.087
Log cabin.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

07:03.088 --> 07:05.156
A man, a log
and his tools.

07:05.157 --> 07:07.591
<i>(grunts)</i>

07:07.592 --> 07:11.162
Al comes from
pretty hardy
pioneer stock.

07:11.163 --> 07:13.398
I do.

07:13.399 --> 07:17.402
As a matter of fact, we have
a picture of the matriarch
of the borland clan -

07:17.403 --> 07:19.904
Al's great-great-grandmother -
sal borland.

07:22.807 --> 07:24.542
<i>(neighing)</i>

07:24.543 --> 07:26.577
<i>(gunshot, then crash)</i>

07:28.180 --> 07:30.381
How long have you been
working on that cabin, al?

07:30.382 --> 07:34.452
About four and a half months,
tim.

07:34.453 --> 07:37.755
But that's only because
I'm doing it
the old-fashioned way -

07:37.756 --> 07:40.124
The sweat of my brow
and an ax.

07:40.125 --> 07:41.725
A pox on your ax, al.

07:43.762 --> 07:45.829
This is what
you need, buddy.

07:45.830 --> 07:47.765
<i>(chainsaw motor runs)</i>

07:50.035 --> 07:54.105
You know, the binford 8200.
82cc's, 42-inch pro bar,

07:54.106 --> 07:56.674
Silicone pistons,
steel bucking spike.

07:56.675 --> 07:59.577
<i>(makes monkey noises)</i>

07:59.578 --> 08:03.013
That's fine, tim,
but I'm trying to build it
the way my forefathers did.

08:03.014 --> 08:05.683
But, al, three out of four
fathers recommend this.

08:05.684 --> 08:07.618
<i>(chainsaw motor runs)</i>

08:12.157 --> 08:16.160
I prefer the ax, tim.
You power that yourself.

08:16.161 --> 08:19.097
Fine. Build it
the wimpy way, al.

08:19.098 --> 08:21.132
But next time on <i>tool time,</i>

08:21.133 --> 08:24.202
I'm gonna show everybody
just how to use
the binford 8200.

08:24.203 --> 08:26.137
<i>(chainsaw motor runs)</i>

08:29.241 --> 08:31.675
That way, you can all
learn how to build

08:31.676 --> 08:33.711
Your own
log condominium.

08:33.712 --> 08:36.581
Well, tim, I think
you should point out that
that particular chainsaw

08:36.582 --> 08:38.816
Is very powerful
and dangerous...
<i>(chainsaw motor)</i>

08:38.817 --> 08:40.717
...And should not be...
<i>(chainsaw motor runs)</i>

08:40.719 --> 08:42.486
...Should not be
used without...
<i>(chainsaw motor runs)</i>

08:42.488 --> 08:45.389
<i>(chainsaw motor</i>
<i>switches on and off)</i>

08:51.263 --> 08:54.031
<i>(chainsaw motor runs)</i>

08:54.032 --> 08:55.966
<i>(chainsaw motor stops)</i>

09:01.640 --> 09:04.942
This particular chainsaw
should not be used without
the assistance of a trained...

09:04.943 --> 09:06.877
<i>(chainsaw motor runs)</i>

09:08.380 --> 09:11.449
Do you guys know
what a will is?

09:11.450 --> 09:15.052
It's a paper that says
who's gonna get your stuff
when you die.

09:15.053 --> 09:18.589
Yeah, it's good to have one
in case we kill you.

09:18.590 --> 09:20.891
Mom and dad
are making one now.

09:20.892 --> 09:23.694
I get the hot rod.
No way. Why?

09:23.695 --> 09:26.564
'cause I'm the oldest.
I get all the good stuff.

09:26.565 --> 09:28.432
No, you don't.
I want the hot rod.
Too bad.

09:28.433 --> 09:31.735
Yeah, too bad, huh?

09:31.736 --> 09:33.971
Hey. Good leg sweep, randy.

09:36.275 --> 09:39.277
Who gets the hot rod
when you die?

09:39.278 --> 09:42.446
When I die? That's all
you're worried about -
who gets the hot rod?

09:42.447 --> 09:44.915
Fine, forget the hot rod.
Who gets the stereo?

09:47.252 --> 09:50.221
Why don't you let me
worry about that, and you worry
about setting the table.

09:50.222 --> 09:52.923
I'll figure out
my will myself.

09:52.924 --> 09:54.858
<i>(quacking noise)</i>

09:57.028 --> 09:58.362
Is that you, wilson?

09:58.363 --> 10:00.130
Yes, indeedy,
good neighbor.

10:00.131 --> 10:03.267
Actually, what you heard
was <i>anas platyrhynchos,</i>

10:03.268 --> 10:06.204
More commonly known
as the mallard.

10:06.205 --> 10:10.074
Wilson, jill and I
are working on our will,
and it's really getting to me.

10:10.075 --> 10:11.842
Actually, tim,

10:11.843 --> 10:14.144
It's quite appropriate
that you're
contemplating death.

10:14.145 --> 10:16.414
Yeah, why's that?

10:16.415 --> 10:19.317
Well, you see, when
you rearrange the letters
of your name, tim taylor,

10:19.318 --> 10:21.252
It spells the word
"mortality."

10:21.253 --> 10:23.987
Oh, I hate to hear stuff
like that, wilson.

10:23.988 --> 10:26.056
Does that
disturb you, tim?

10:26.057 --> 10:29.393
Not as much as the fact
that you know that.

10:29.394 --> 10:33.598
Now, jill taylor,
on the other hand, would be...

10:33.599 --> 10:35.233
"jolly trail."

10:38.337 --> 10:40.638
There's been no jolly trail
over here.

10:40.639 --> 10:42.673
We've been arguing
about that will.

10:42.674 --> 10:44.675
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

10:44.676 --> 10:46.043
I hate wills.

10:46.044 --> 10:49.113
I wonder who started them.
Where'd they come from?

10:49.114 --> 10:51.849
Well, tim, I'm sure
you could trace it back
to some chiseled drawing

10:51.850 --> 10:55.519
On the cave wall
of cro-magnon man.

10:55.520 --> 10:58.489
Ting, ting, ting,
ting, ting, ting.

10:58.490 --> 11:01.959
I, grog -
ting, ting, ting, ting, ting -

11:01.960 --> 11:05.329
Leave my wheel -
ting, ting, ting, ting -

11:05.330 --> 11:08.532
To grog jr. -
Ting, ting.

11:08.533 --> 11:12.370
To my loving wife -
ting, ting, ting, ting <i>-</i>

11:12.371 --> 11:14.938
Whose shrill cry
scares the mastodon -

11:14.939 --> 11:17.475
Ting, ting, ting, ting -

11:17.476 --> 11:19.644
I leave this stick.

11:23.348 --> 11:25.883
You see, tim, wills
are the natural outgrowth

11:25.884 --> 11:27.985
Of our mortality
consciousness.

11:27.986 --> 11:29.754
Huh?

11:29.755 --> 11:32.490
I'm saying the human being
is the only animal
from an early age

11:32.491 --> 11:36.260
That realizes that
it's going to die.

11:36.261 --> 11:39.297
It may know it's going to die,
but it doesn't know when.

11:39.298 --> 11:43.734
Oh, I wouldn't worry,
neighbor. You probably have
50 more good years.

11:43.735 --> 11:45.736
Or I could die tomorrow.

11:48.340 --> 11:51.041
<i>(quacking noise)</i>

12:02.921 --> 12:04.622
Honey, what are you doing?

12:04.623 --> 12:05.956
I'm working on my hot rod.

12:05.957 --> 12:07.792
It's 4:30.

12:07.793 --> 12:11.261
I wanted to get
an early start on it today.
Did I wake you up?

12:11.262 --> 12:14.231
No. I'm starting
my paper route this morning.

12:18.102 --> 12:20.003
I'm sorry.

12:20.004 --> 12:23.273
Are you thinking
about the will?
No.

12:23.274 --> 12:26.377
Well, I have been.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.679
I've decided
that you're right.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.849
Maybe we
should let your brother jeff
have the kids. They love him.

12:31.850 --> 12:36.487
No. Jeff doesn't know how
to raise kids. He's demented.

12:36.488 --> 12:39.590
He used to put honey
on my butt and make me
sit in red ant piles.

12:43.328 --> 12:46.597
I thought that you said that
that was who you wanted.

12:46.598 --> 12:48.699
Well, I changed my mind.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.267
Then who do you want?

12:50.268 --> 12:52.102
I don't want anyone.

12:52.103 --> 12:54.672
Tim, what is bothering you?

12:54.673 --> 12:57.241
Nothing is bothering me.
Come on,
there's something.

12:57.242 --> 12:59.777
Is it anything
to do with your dad?

12:59.778 --> 13:02.813
No. It has nothing to do
with my dad. I just don't
think anybody's qualified

13:02.814 --> 13:04.548
To take care of the boys.

13:04.549 --> 13:07.551
I guess you and I
just can't die.

13:07.552 --> 13:10.621
You don't think you're being
a little irrational?

13:10.622 --> 13:15.559
Easy for you to say.
You're "jolly trail."
what?

13:15.560 --> 13:17.995
See, I'm
not being irrational.
I just know too much.

13:17.996 --> 13:21.699
If I were an animal,
I would be unconscious.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.868
Think about that.

13:30.809 --> 13:31.842
Thank you.

13:31.843 --> 13:33.844
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

13:33.845 --> 13:35.345
I'm tim "the tool man" taylor,

13:35.346 --> 13:38.949
And you all know al,
the great-great-grandson
of sal borland.

13:38.950 --> 13:40.984
<i>(loud cheering)</i>

13:45.724 --> 13:50.594
Al, you perchance
have some friends
in the audience today?

13:50.595 --> 13:52.296
More than friends, tim.

13:52.297 --> 13:54.532
I'd like to introduce
a group that I inspired.

13:54.533 --> 13:56.901
People without personalities.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.237
No, tim.

14:00.238 --> 14:02.473
I'd like
to introduce a group that's
in our studio audience today,

14:02.474 --> 14:05.108
The al borland fan club.

14:07.813 --> 14:10.280
Welcome, members of abfc.

14:12.050 --> 14:14.051
Al, do you call it a club

14:14.052 --> 14:16.954
'cause you've gotta
beat these guys over the head
to get them to join?

14:18.790 --> 14:21.325
<i>(all)</i> I don't think so, tim.

14:27.031 --> 14:29.032
Well, since your
fan club's here,

14:29.033 --> 14:31.635
Why don't I let you
introduce the project
for today, al?

14:34.773 --> 14:39.042
Today, tim will be
demonstrating log cutting
with the binford 8200.

14:39.043 --> 14:42.412
And to help him out,
we have a couple of lumberjacks
with us today -

14:42.413 --> 14:45.015
Red jenkins and phil gaxton.

14:47.486 --> 14:49.687
This way.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.288
Thanks, men.

14:51.289 --> 14:52.322
Here you go, al.

14:52.323 --> 14:54.525
Thanks for the buttons.

14:57.496 --> 14:59.597
Golly, it's a lot bigger

14:59.598 --> 15:02.032
Than it looks
in the picture, isn't it?

15:02.033 --> 15:05.102
Hope you have
life insurance.

15:05.103 --> 15:08.005
They don't call it
"the widow maker" for nothing.

15:08.006 --> 15:10.875
W-w-widow maker?

15:10.876 --> 15:14.177
That's right. But I'm sure
you'll do all right, tim.

15:14.178 --> 15:16.814
Al, this would be
the perfect project for you.

15:16.815 --> 15:18.181
Tim, it's your show.

15:20.084 --> 15:23.988
I wonder if your fans
would like to see you take
the reins of this bad boy.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.990
What about it,
al pals? Ha-ha!

15:28.259 --> 15:32.997
You see, tim,
an al pal's first duty
is to watch out for al.

15:38.336 --> 15:39.503
And it's my first duty

15:39.504 --> 15:41.438
To fire you for not
doing what I say, al.

15:43.474 --> 15:47.144
Red, phil, why don't you
bring out al's log?

15:47.145 --> 15:48.612
Here's a lesson
for you kids at home.

15:48.613 --> 15:51.916
Always have your coworker
do the dangerous stunts.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.684
Sure, the girls
are gonna think he's cooler,

15:53.685 --> 15:58.255
But you'll get
the girl in the end
because you survived.

15:58.256 --> 16:00.257
Remember, safety first.

16:02.393 --> 16:04.494
<i>You've seen it</i>
<i>cut through wood,</i>

16:04.495 --> 16:06.530
<i>You've seen it</i>
<i>cut through concrete,</i>

16:06.531 --> 16:07.998
<i>But that's not all.</i>

16:07.999 --> 16:09.466
<i>The kasaki steak knife</i>

16:09.467 --> 16:11.234
<i>Will also cut through</i>
<i>this two-inch exhaust pipe...</i>

16:11.235 --> 16:13.170
Oh.

16:15.473 --> 16:17.541
Uh-huh. Ok.
I found it.

16:17.542 --> 16:21.645
Expiration is 7/93.

16:21.646 --> 16:23.914
Right. I want
the whole kasaki set.

16:23.915 --> 16:27.618
The super set, right.
I get the leather pouch, right?

16:27.619 --> 16:30.253
Oh, that just
looks like leather? Oh.

16:30.254 --> 16:32.322
All right, but I ordered
a whole set,

16:32.323 --> 16:34.491
So I get that titanium
cheese slicer, too, right?

16:34.492 --> 16:35.626
Great.
Thank you.

16:35.627 --> 16:37.795
Hey.

16:37.796 --> 16:39.329
What are you doing up,
little man?

16:39.330 --> 16:41.799
It's 3:00
in the morning.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.100
Can't sleep?

16:43.101 --> 16:45.469
What's the matter?

16:45.470 --> 16:48.338
Dad, are you gonna die?

16:48.339 --> 16:52.576
Not till I've
paid for these knives.

16:52.577 --> 16:54.812
Come over here.
What's the matter with you?

16:54.813 --> 16:57.414
You told wilson
you're going to die.

16:57.415 --> 16:58.482
You heard that?

16:58.483 --> 17:00.618
I was in the tree.

17:00.619 --> 17:03.353
Well, I didn't mean
I was gonna die now.

17:03.354 --> 17:05.089
I'm gonna live
for a long, long time.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.758
But your dad died
when you were a kid.

17:09.460 --> 17:12.630
That doesn't mean anything's
gonna happen to me.

17:12.631 --> 17:15.464
But what if it does?

17:17.234 --> 17:20.137
Well, I'll find
somebody really cool
to take care of you.

17:20.137 --> 17:21.905
Like al?

17:27.545 --> 17:29.312
He'll assist that person.

17:31.082 --> 17:34.952
If you're not gonna die,
why do you need a will?

17:34.953 --> 17:36.153
'cause, uh...

17:36.154 --> 17:39.256
Honey? That's just something

17:39.257 --> 17:43.027
That every responsible adult
has to do.

17:43.028 --> 17:45.462
That's what I was gonna say.

17:45.463 --> 17:47.164
You don't have to worry
about that stuff.

17:47.165 --> 17:51.601
No, you only have to
worry about vegetables

17:51.602 --> 17:54.638
And cleaning up
your own room

17:54.639 --> 17:56.840
And making sure
your brothers

17:56.841 --> 18:00.844
Don't rocket you
over the house.

18:00.845 --> 18:02.612
Besides, you don't have
to worry about that.

18:02.613 --> 18:04.782
Just know that
your mom and I...
Shh.

18:17.729 --> 18:21.098
So I guess you're not
the only one that's been
losing sleep over this.

18:21.099 --> 18:24.568
Yeah, but he gets
to ask questions.
I gotta answer them.

18:24.569 --> 18:26.904
Guess that makes you the dad.

18:29.207 --> 18:31.675
Are you ok?
Yeah.

18:33.745 --> 18:35.412
What are you
thinking about?

18:35.413 --> 18:37.781
The car.

18:40.085 --> 18:41.118
Hot rod?

18:42.587 --> 18:47.725
A 1957 ford fairlane
500 skyliner.

18:47.726 --> 18:51.494
It was two-tone -
deep emerald green and ivory.

18:52.897 --> 18:56.366
Why are you
thinking about that?

18:56.367 --> 18:57.434
Uh...

18:57.435 --> 18:59.803
That was the...

18:59.804 --> 19:02.773
That was the car
that dad and my brothers,

19:02.774 --> 19:05.776
We used to goof around
with on saturdays.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.711
And, god, it was...

19:07.712 --> 19:10.380
It was a hardtop convertible.
Those are tough to get.
You can't find them.

19:10.381 --> 19:12.382
Boy, that was a great car.

19:12.383 --> 19:14.317
You know, and then,
you know, he died.

19:19.390 --> 19:21.691
Uncle harry took the car,
and he sold it.

19:21.692 --> 19:23.693
We never seen it again.

19:23.694 --> 19:27.231
And that was the best thing
I ever remember about my dad.

19:29.033 --> 19:31.101
Honey,

19:31.102 --> 19:34.504
Isn't that the perfect reason
for you to sign a will?

19:34.505 --> 19:37.941
Well, that would be
the perfect reason, sure.

19:37.942 --> 19:41.078
Then why don't you
sign it?

19:41.079 --> 19:43.747
Dad was, uh...

19:43.748 --> 19:47.651
Only three years older
than I am now when he died.

19:47.652 --> 19:50.954
And he had all boys,
and I have all boys.

19:50.955 --> 19:55.725
And he, you know, he built
a ford in the garage, and...

19:55.726 --> 19:57.261
I got a ford in the garage,

19:57.262 --> 19:59.729
And I don't want my kids
growing up without their dad,

19:59.730 --> 20:02.166
And I kinda figure
that if I sign that will,
it means I'm gonna die.

20:03.301 --> 20:06.036
But you know that's not true.

20:10.809 --> 20:13.710
Besides, there's...

20:13.711 --> 20:17.014
There's one big difference
between you and your father.

20:17.015 --> 20:18.282
What's that?

20:18.283 --> 20:20.250
His car worked.

20:24.622 --> 20:26.656
I miss my dad
an awful lot, honey.

20:26.657 --> 20:27.691
I know, I know.

20:34.665 --> 20:36.766
Wanna go upstairs
and go to bed?
All right.

20:36.767 --> 20:39.402
Gonna be awful tired
tomorrow.

20:39.403 --> 20:42.005
Can you carry mark up?
Sure.

20:42.006 --> 20:43.941
Ok.

21:05.730 --> 21:07.865
Oh, like that's believable -

21:07.866 --> 21:11.468
A steak knife that could
cut through a tree trunk.

21:11.469 --> 21:14.204
What kinds of idiots
call up these shows

21:14.205 --> 21:16.539
In the middle of the night
and order this junk?

21:16.540 --> 21:18.708
Huh. It takes
all kinds, honey.

21:26.450 --> 21:28.585
Mom?

21:28.586 --> 21:31.154
Will you give my will
to the lawyer?

21:31.155 --> 21:34.758
You made a will?
That is so responsible of you.

21:34.759 --> 21:35.993
Let's see. "I give
my piggy bank,

21:35.994 --> 21:38.962
"my rollerblades,
and all my toys to mom,

21:38.963 --> 21:43.267
"except my g.I. Joe
that brad pulled the head off.

21:43.268 --> 21:46.103
I leave that to randy
'cause I think he knows
where the head is."

21:49.073 --> 21:51.841
Maybe we can take care of that
while you're still alive.

21:53.444 --> 21:54.945
He gave everything to you?

21:54.946 --> 21:59.016
Yep, just like you.

21:59.017 --> 22:01.851
You know, honey,
I've been thinking.

22:01.852 --> 22:05.622
If I die first,
I want you to remarry.

22:05.623 --> 22:07.457
Thanks.

22:07.458 --> 22:08.558
Would you?

22:08.559 --> 22:12.195
You just said I could.

22:12.196 --> 22:15.098
Yeah, I know,
but would you?

22:15.099 --> 22:17.267
Uh, are you sure
you're dead?

22:17.268 --> 22:18.936
Yeah.

22:18.937 --> 22:20.737
How long?
Years.

22:22.307 --> 22:24.207
Ok, I'd remarry.

22:24.208 --> 22:26.676
What kind of woman
would it be?

22:26.677 --> 22:31.681
Well, I guess
I'd look for a woman
that was alive.

22:31.682 --> 22:34.818
That would make it easier
to get the blood test.

22:34.819 --> 22:36.353
Maybe I'd...

22:36.354 --> 22:39.056
Well, I'd want someone
who's a good mom,

22:39.057 --> 22:42.092
Sensitive and caring,

22:42.093 --> 22:44.627
Good sense of humor,
and loving.

22:44.628 --> 22:46.796
You know, because
I'd like my second marriage

22:46.797 --> 22:48.765
To be a lot better
than this one.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.907
I'll haunt you.

23:01.479 --> 23:03.480
The binford 8200.

23:03.481 --> 23:05.548
Huh? 42-inch pro bar,

23:05.549 --> 23:07.317
Silicone pistons.

23:07.318 --> 23:10.120
Huh? Steel
something or other.

23:12.857 --> 23:15.158
...And should not be...
<i>(chainsaw motor runs)</i>

23:15.159 --> 23:17.294
...Should not be
used without...
<i>(chainsaw motor runs)</i>

23:17.295 --> 23:19.162
<i>(chainsaw motor</i>
<i>turns on and off)</i>
