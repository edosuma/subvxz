00:00.039 --> 00:03.005
Previously on AMC's
"Better Call Saul"...

00:03.016 --> 00:05.309
You, as the lawyer who brought
this case to the firm...

00:05.320 --> 00:07.945
- we can guarantee you 20%.
- That will work.

00:07.955 --> 00:09.466
My brother is sick!

00:09.477 --> 00:10.943
Unfortunately, we have an
issue we need to discuss.

00:10.945 --> 00:12.545
It concerns your malpractice insurance.

00:12.547 --> 00:14.503
I looked at the numbers,
and I can carry us.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.932
I'll take care of my half.
You take care of yours.

00:16.943 --> 00:18.967
Mr. Gatwood? Hi. Kim Wexler.

00:18.983 --> 00:20.316
I've got no choice.

00:20.318 --> 00:22.387
Hector wants to use my dad's business.

00:22.398 --> 00:24.364
I've got cash I can't spend.

00:24.375 --> 00:27.290
You opened this place to
solve a similar problem.

00:27.292 --> 00:28.984
Perhaps there is a way.

00:45.639 --> 00:47.693
_

01:08.194 --> 01:11.086
Mrs. Landry, you're
looking lovely as ever.

01:11.097 --> 01:13.047
Jimmy McGill!

01:13.058 --> 01:15.023
W-What are you doing here?

01:15.034 --> 01:16.984
Oh, I was in the area, and I thought...

01:16.995 --> 01:19.862
I wonder how my favorite
former client is doing?

01:19.873 --> 01:21.370
And I have cookies.

01:21.394 --> 01:22.927
Oh, you're so sweet.

01:22.929 --> 01:24.361
Come on in!

01:24.363 --> 01:25.472
After I made these,

01:25.483 --> 01:28.098
I looked down, and I thought, "Wow!

01:28.100 --> 01:30.421
That looks just like your Felix."

01:31.498 --> 01:33.288
They do!

01:33.299 --> 01:35.409
You're so thoughtful.

01:35.420 --> 01:37.141
I was afraid you wouldn't be here.

01:37.143 --> 01:38.315
Thought, with that settlement money,

01:38.326 --> 01:41.078
you might've moved somewhere swankier.

01:41.080 --> 01:44.007
- What do you mean?
- The settlement.

01:44.018 --> 01:45.984
The Sandpiper case?

01:45.995 --> 01:47.551
Now, that's gotta be
wrapped up by now, right?

01:47.553 --> 01:51.827
Oh, that? That... that...
that... that's still years away.

01:51.838 --> 01:52.890
You haven't settled yet?

01:52.892 --> 01:55.559
No, I don't know all the
details yet, but Erin...

01:55.561 --> 01:59.396
uh, Erin Brill of Davis
& Main... do you know her?

01:59.407 --> 02:04.159
Lovely girl. She reminds
me of a young Mary Martin.

02:04.170 --> 02:06.679
Oh, yes. I-I have met her.

02:06.690 --> 02:09.565
It's a... She's a
wonderful young lady. Uh...

02:09.576 --> 02:11.139
Well, she takes care of all of that,

02:11.150 --> 02:14.245
and she said there's
still a long way to go.

02:14.247 --> 02:16.944
But you've... received an offer, right?

02:16.955 --> 02:19.785
Something sent to you in writing?

02:19.796 --> 02:22.686
I mean, something more than
just Erin and you chatting?

02:22.688 --> 02:24.038
Oh.

02:27.389 --> 02:30.488
It's probably all here in this box.

02:30.499 --> 02:32.997
I can't make heads or tails of it,

02:32.999 --> 02:35.582
but you are welcome to look.

02:35.593 --> 02:36.992
You sure?

02:37.003 --> 02:39.433
Of course. It's you.

02:41.058 --> 02:44.563
Well, uh, I gotta say...

02:44.574 --> 02:48.212
I can't blame you for getting
mixed up with all this.

02:49.699 --> 02:51.331
I mean, these legal notices...

02:51.342 --> 02:54.518
I mean, no one really understands them.

02:54.520 --> 02:57.354
You know, I've got a law degree.

02:57.356 --> 02:59.690
And sometimes I can't even, uh...

03:03.468 --> 03:05.491
I can't even, uh...

03:11.296 --> 03:13.170
You haven't, uh...

03:13.749 --> 03:15.406
accepted this?

03:15.408 --> 03:17.679
Erin says we should wait.

03:18.608 --> 03:19.843
But...

03:21.851 --> 03:24.233
Erin doesn't really matter, does she?

03:24.244 --> 03:27.327
I mean, you're the Class Representative.

03:27.820 --> 03:29.253
That's a big deal.

03:29.255 --> 03:32.189
That means you and you alone decide.

03:32.191 --> 03:34.819
You're... you are the legal stand-in

03:34.830 --> 03:37.161
for your friends and neighbors.

03:37.163 --> 03:39.380
I-I don't know about all that, Jimmy.

03:39.391 --> 03:42.681
I-I just leave it all
to the professionals.

03:42.692 --> 03:44.478
Yeah, sure, sure.

03:44.489 --> 03:46.434
Lawyers know best, but...

03:47.122 --> 03:49.073
I'm sorry.

03:49.075 --> 03:50.407
If you won the lottery,

03:50.409 --> 03:52.276
I mean, you'd take the lump sum, right?

03:52.278 --> 03:54.945
I mean, money now is
better than money later.

03:54.947 --> 03:57.605
- Bird in the hand!
- I suppose.

03:57.616 --> 03:59.683
The more time to enjoy it!

04:01.120 --> 04:03.354
You really should talk to Erin.

04:03.356 --> 04:05.589
She knows all the ins and outs.

04:05.591 --> 04:07.257
Ins and outs.

04:07.259 --> 04:10.372
Yeah, Erin sure knows those.

04:10.383 --> 04:14.166
I'll be happy to talk to Erin, uh...

04:14.177 --> 04:16.065
Just... I just can't help but wonder

04:16.067 --> 04:19.880
if she's taking every aspect into a...

04:20.308 --> 04:21.923
Oh, Jimmy.

04:21.934 --> 04:23.978
I completely forgot...

04:23.989 --> 04:26.410
I'm on my way to chair yoga.

04:26.412 --> 04:27.745
I'm so sorry.

04:27.747 --> 04:29.113
No, it's okay.

04:29.115 --> 04:31.915
Um, I probably should be going.

04:31.917 --> 04:34.291
I have a lot to do.

04:38.223 --> 04:39.416
Hi.

04:39.427 --> 04:40.478
- Jimmy!
- Jimmy!

04:40.489 --> 04:43.408
- Jimmy!
- Rose, Myrtle, Helen.

04:43.793 --> 04:46.324
That chair yoga really works, huh?

04:46.340 --> 04:47.505
You all look 10 years younger.

04:47.516 --> 04:48.598
Oh!

04:48.609 --> 04:50.401
- You honeydripper.
- Hey, hurry up.

04:50.403 --> 04:51.635
It starts in five minutes.

04:51.637 --> 04:52.723
Do you want to come with us?

04:52.734 --> 04:54.605
You're welcome to. We can have guests.

04:54.607 --> 04:58.075
I would love to, uh, but
I'm not dressed for it.

04:58.077 --> 05:00.579
So I'll take a rain check.

05:00.590 --> 05:01.696
Certainly.

05:01.707 --> 05:03.058
Thanks for the cookies, Jimmy.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.082
- Bye, Jimmy! Good to see ya.
- Bye!

05:09.755 --> 05:11.255
That can't be right.

05:11.257 --> 05:13.123
Can't be right.

05:17.337 --> 05:20.595
17.4 total.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.056
33% is the common fund.

05:23.067 --> 05:26.291
So, on 1/15,

05:26.302 --> 05:28.775
15 into 17...

05:30.041 --> 05:31.900
carry the 2.

05:32.548 --> 05:35.283
One million, one hundred and sixty...

05:36.869 --> 05:42.025
One million, one hundred
and sixty thousand!

05:43.575 --> 05:45.255
Holy shit!

www.addic7ed.com

06:19.140 --> 06:20.873
- Mr. Ehrmantraut?
- Yeah.

06:20.875 --> 06:22.033
Sorry to keep you waiting.

06:22.044 --> 06:24.307
It'll be right this way.

06:24.658 --> 06:27.312
Can I get you anything to
drink? Tea, water, espresso?

06:27.314 --> 06:29.322
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

06:45.672 --> 06:46.965
Ms. Rodarte-Quayle?

06:46.967 --> 06:48.969
- I have your next...
- Yes, thank you.

06:48.980 --> 06:51.195
Mr. Ehrmantraut, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle.

06:51.206 --> 06:53.945
- Mike.
- Thanks, Justin.

06:53.956 --> 06:57.797
Have a seat, um... Mike.

06:58.305 --> 07:00.062
HR sent up your start paperwork.

07:00.073 --> 07:02.774
I-9, W-2. Pretty standard.

07:04.985 --> 07:08.487
Could I have your driver's
license and Social Security card?

07:08.489 --> 07:09.640
Why?

07:09.651 --> 07:11.702
My assistant needs to make a copy.

07:12.687 --> 07:16.652
How does this "hire" work,
exactly? Walk me through it.

07:16.663 --> 07:18.597
You'll receive a paycheck from Madrigal

07:18.599 --> 07:20.599
in the amount of $10,000 per week.

07:20.601 --> 07:21.952
I believe at that rate,

07:21.963 --> 07:25.249
your "employment" should be
paid out in about 20 weeks.

07:25.260 --> 07:29.004
Mr. Fring has arranged to
cover FICA, Social Security...

07:29.015 --> 07:31.162
the entirety of the tax burden.

07:31.173 --> 07:33.474
I assume that's all right with you?

07:35.796 --> 07:37.249
Good. So, to that end,

07:37.251 --> 07:39.828
I have you down as a
"logistics consultant."

07:39.839 --> 07:41.574
What is that?

07:41.585 --> 07:45.105
It's a person who consults on logistics.

07:45.116 --> 07:46.710
Does it matter?

07:47.546 --> 07:50.429
I'm not long on logistics.

07:50.431 --> 07:52.304
"Security consultant" would be better.

07:52.315 --> 07:54.390
I used to be a cop.

07:54.401 --> 07:56.635
That will look better
on your "work history"

07:56.637 --> 07:59.031
than your current employer, SMQ Parking.

07:59.042 --> 08:01.867
So, you take my money,

08:01.878 --> 08:04.434
you run it through this
joint, and it comes out clean.

08:04.445 --> 08:06.078
- That it?
- Yes.

08:06.718 --> 08:08.718
Who knows this operation?

08:08.729 --> 08:10.874
You... anyone else?

08:10.885 --> 08:13.140
- No.
- You sure?

08:14.234 --> 08:18.123
May I ask, what precisely
is your concern here?

08:18.125 --> 08:19.906
I am concerned about what happens

08:19.917 --> 08:23.095
if you put my real name in your books.

08:23.562 --> 08:26.248
Your Madrigal is a German company.

08:26.259 --> 08:29.794
One thing I know about Germans
is they love a good audit.

08:31.562 --> 08:35.078
I oversee eight freight terminals
across Texas and the Southwest.

08:35.089 --> 08:38.028
Operating costs range between $800,000

08:38.039 --> 08:40.602
and a million dollars per week.

08:40.614 --> 08:44.293
All due respect, Mike, but your money?

08:44.304 --> 08:46.004
It's a rounding error.

08:46.015 --> 08:48.496
If the IRS or anyone else looks,

08:48.507 --> 08:50.453
you're a contractor for a
multinational corporation

08:50.464 --> 08:53.887
with 114,000 employees worldwide.

08:53.898 --> 08:56.328
You're like every other
person in this building.

08:56.330 --> 08:58.054
Like you?

08:59.499 --> 09:01.703
You think I'm not on the books?

09:01.714 --> 09:04.535
I am. Under my own name.

09:04.546 --> 09:07.506
- This the way you handled it before?
- Handled what?

09:07.508 --> 09:10.642
The money. For Fring's other guys.

09:11.487 --> 09:13.154
Other guys?

09:14.101 --> 09:16.618
This is the first time I've done this...

09:16.629 --> 09:17.929
for anyone.

09:19.265 --> 09:21.871
I don't know what you do, but...

09:21.882 --> 09:24.890
Mr. Fring must think
you're quite good at it.

09:40.531 --> 09:42.207
20 weeks?

09:42.209 --> 09:44.142
The sooner you're off
my books, the better.

09:44.144 --> 09:45.726
Justin?

09:53.373 --> 09:55.967
Can you make a copy of
these, please? Thank you.

10:01.238 --> 10:02.685
What?

10:04.859 --> 10:07.264
This is a very nice office.

10:07.735 --> 10:09.209
Thank you.

10:12.373 --> 10:15.715
Seem to be risking a
lot for a drug dealer.

10:15.726 --> 10:17.339
"Drug dealer"?

10:21.382 --> 10:24.116
If that's all you think he is...

10:24.883 --> 10:27.456
then you don't know Gustavo Fring.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.940
Let me understand you...

10:48.942 --> 10:51.031
you're proposing to double our premiums

10:51.042 --> 10:54.279
on every one of our
practicing attorneys?

10:54.922 --> 10:56.548
We know this is abrupt...

10:56.550 --> 10:58.784
new issues have come to light.

10:58.786 --> 11:00.661
"New issues"?

11:00.672 --> 11:03.043
You mean Mr. McGill's
testimony at the Bar?

11:03.054 --> 11:04.589
That's a part of it, yes.

11:04.591 --> 11:06.879
After 25 years of paying full premiums,

11:06.890 --> 11:08.942
I can count on one hand
the number of our claims.

11:08.953 --> 11:10.957
This is an underwriting
decision... that's all.

11:10.968 --> 11:12.564
You shouldn't take it personally.

11:12.566 --> 11:14.266
In some special circumstances,

11:14.268 --> 11:16.068
we have been known to extend a rider.

11:16.070 --> 11:17.302
What kind of rider?

11:17.304 --> 11:19.171
A senior, management-level partner

11:19.173 --> 11:21.173
who would supervise Charles' work,

11:21.175 --> 11:23.788
attend court and client
meetings with him,

11:23.799 --> 11:25.099
review filings.

11:25.110 --> 11:26.243
The few times we've done this,

11:26.254 --> 11:27.899
it's been for clients
with a high probability

11:27.910 --> 11:30.165
of catastrophic health
failure as a precaution.

11:30.176 --> 11:32.759
What you're saying is that
for any case Charles takes on,

11:32.770 --> 11:34.954
another partner would
be tied up, as well,

11:34.965 --> 11:36.365
and we don't bill a penny more?

11:36.376 --> 11:38.147
This is ludicrous.

11:38.158 --> 11:40.787
The insurance industry
is heavily regulated.

11:40.798 --> 11:42.345
I can think of a dozen infractions

11:42.356 --> 11:44.688
- right here off the top of my head.
- Mr. McGill...

11:44.697 --> 11:47.298
You're hoping we'll
either find another carrier

11:47.300 --> 11:49.131
or cut you an enormous check.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.342
Win-win for you!

11:50.353 --> 11:52.536
I assure you, neither
is going to happen.

11:52.538 --> 11:54.366
What will happen is very simple...

11:54.377 --> 11:55.928
you're going to do right by us

11:55.939 --> 11:57.674
or we will compel you to do so.

11:57.685 --> 12:00.277
- What do you mean by "compel"?
- You know exactly what I mean.

12:00.279 --> 12:03.147
If you're threatening litigation,
I'm afraid this meeting is over.

12:03.158 --> 12:04.768
Then it's over.

12:05.447 --> 12:07.095
Thank you for your time.

12:07.115 --> 12:09.666
Mr. Hamlin, Mr. McGill.

12:19.799 --> 12:21.788
All right. Where do we begin?

12:21.799 --> 12:24.335
Francis should start
digging into regulations.

12:24.337 --> 12:26.971
I'm sorry I don't have the code sections

12:26.973 --> 12:28.405
at my fingertips just now.

12:28.407 --> 12:30.207
Let's pull a team of associates

12:30.209 --> 12:33.407
and get them looking at every
angle of injunctive relief.

12:33.418 --> 12:34.762
Before close of business...

12:34.773 --> 12:37.147
... we're going to hit Santa
Rosa with a demand letter

12:37.149 --> 12:38.916
that'll make their heads spin.

12:38.918 --> 12:40.985
Odds are, inside a week,

12:40.987 --> 12:42.848
they'll be sitting at the table again.

12:42.859 --> 12:44.754
And if not...

12:44.757 --> 12:47.523
well, we've never
shied away from a fight.

12:51.384 --> 12:53.342
Chuck, do you remember Al McConnell?

12:53.353 --> 12:55.232
Of course. Helluva litigator.

12:55.234 --> 12:56.697
Retired now, isn't he?

12:56.708 --> 12:59.006
He's a professor at UNM now.

12:59.017 --> 13:02.006
Wrote a fantastic book on
SCOTUS during Reconstruction.

13:02.008 --> 13:03.240
Fascinating stuff.

13:03.242 --> 13:04.392
Okay...

13:04.403 --> 13:07.100
I was talking to him, and he mentioned

13:07.111 --> 13:10.053
he'd love you to come
speak to his One-Ls.

13:10.064 --> 13:13.134
Maybe make it a regular
thing, if you wanted.

13:14.607 --> 13:16.387
What are you talking about, Howard?

13:16.389 --> 13:18.561
What I'm saying is...

13:18.572 --> 13:21.425
maybe it's time to hang up your spurs.

13:21.947 --> 13:23.818
Become partner emeritus...

13:23.829 --> 13:26.397
leave your name on the firm
but focus on your legacy.

13:26.399 --> 13:29.834
You always said you wanted to
work on the Commerce Clause...

13:29.845 --> 13:31.545
you can write the book on it.

13:31.556 --> 13:34.390
And no longer be a practicing lawyer.

13:36.157 --> 13:38.811
Chuck, there's more to life than this.

13:38.822 --> 13:41.645
That day is far in the future, Howard.

13:41.647 --> 13:44.447
And I don't appreciate the suggestion.

13:46.212 --> 13:48.118
What if it's not a suggestion?

13:48.120 --> 13:49.298
Meaning?

13:49.309 --> 13:52.222
Meaning, if enough people
tell you that you're drunk,

13:52.224 --> 13:54.491
maybe it's time to sit down.

13:57.128 --> 14:00.507
You want me to retire
over this... insurance?!

14:00.518 --> 14:01.948
It's not just the insurance.

14:01.959 --> 14:04.793
That's the straw that
broke the camel's back.

14:06.151 --> 14:08.839
So this is about my condition.

14:09.121 --> 14:10.503
Look!

14:11.176 --> 14:12.503
Look!

14:14.896 --> 14:16.541
You see?

14:17.542 --> 14:19.450
See?

14:19.452 --> 14:21.018
I'm better!

14:21.456 --> 14:23.823
Howard, I'm fine!

14:27.581 --> 14:30.086
This is not what "fine" looks like.

14:33.969 --> 14:36.500
Chuck, you are the best
legal mind I've ever known.

14:36.502 --> 14:38.102
Hands down.

14:38.722 --> 14:41.184
But your decision-making has become...

14:41.195 --> 14:42.815
unpredictable.

14:43.709 --> 14:47.214
And I can't be partners with
someone whose judgment I don't trust.

14:52.014 --> 14:53.433
Chuck...

15:04.667 --> 15:08.445
This right here is the
Texas-New Mexico border.

15:09.597 --> 15:13.633
Now, all of my wells are square...

15:13.644 --> 15:15.640
on the Texas side.

15:15.651 --> 15:18.859
When I negotiated for the
mineral and property rights,

15:18.870 --> 15:23.078
the surveyors said that the
next nearest pool extended to...

15:27.127 --> 15:28.745
about here.

15:28.756 --> 15:30.202
Right.

15:30.213 --> 15:32.424
But... after some extraction,

15:32.435 --> 15:35.284
the west wall of the salt dome gave way,

15:35.295 --> 15:37.702
opening up another pool
that extends... what...

15:37.713 --> 15:39.361
100 yards over the border?

15:39.363 --> 15:40.885
That's about the size of it, yeah.

15:40.903 --> 15:43.671
And now you have New Mexico
rights holders to deal with.

15:44.174 --> 15:46.080
You know, they should get
profit on what's theirs,

15:46.091 --> 15:48.080
but now I've got two
states coming after me

15:48.091 --> 15:50.291
for taxes on each and every gallon.

15:51.665 --> 15:53.643
No equipment crosses the border?

15:53.654 --> 15:55.253
No, ma'am.

15:55.271 --> 15:57.729
Nothing below the surface, like the...

15:58.815 --> 16:00.572
What... is it a drill bit?

16:00.574 --> 16:03.315
It would be the sucker rod at
this point, but no, none of that.

16:03.326 --> 16:05.110
Only on the Texas side.

16:05.112 --> 16:08.613
But that's not stopping New
Mexico from trying to bleed me.

16:08.973 --> 16:11.214
You said on the phone
you have a solution.

16:12.519 --> 16:14.917
You don't negotiate a lease
with the rights holders.

16:14.928 --> 16:17.497
- You offer to pay them damages.
- Damages?

16:17.508 --> 16:19.638
For diminishing their resource.

16:19.653 --> 16:23.248
A significant fraction of the
value of the New Mexico portion,

16:23.259 --> 16:25.466
but without paying for
the rights themselves.

16:25.866 --> 16:27.857
So a kind of a payoff.

16:29.067 --> 16:31.013
Then you don't get hit with the taxes.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.157
You think you can make that fly?

16:33.168 --> 16:35.669
If someone came to me with this offer...

16:35.680 --> 16:37.542
I'd sure as hell take it.

16:37.544 --> 16:40.011
Wish I'd called you sooner.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.318
Way they're makin' noise,

16:42.329 --> 16:44.966
if I don't get this thing wrapped
up by the end of the quarter,

16:44.977 --> 16:48.259
I'm pretty sure the tax
boys are gonna take me apart.

16:48.270 --> 16:50.771
And that's two weeks from now?

16:53.200 --> 16:54.726
I can do it by then.

16:54.728 --> 16:56.294
Really?

16:56.296 --> 16:58.184
If we can get all the
rights holders in one place,

16:58.195 --> 17:00.729
I can walk them through
what we're proposing.

17:00.740 --> 17:02.901
If they're smart, they'll go for it.

17:02.903 --> 17:04.402
Well, hot damn.

17:07.048 --> 17:09.931
Kevin said you were a miracle
worker, but I didn't believe him.

17:09.942 --> 17:11.742
I'm startin' to.

17:11.744 --> 17:15.146
Yeah, well, let me work that
miracle first, then we'll talk.

17:15.147 --> 17:16.580
You know the way outta here?

17:16.583 --> 17:19.962
I got a drillhead that's acting up on me

17:19.973 --> 17:22.520
out on the north forty I gotta check.

17:22.521 --> 17:23.988
Yeah. I'm good.

17:23.990 --> 17:25.353
You need anything from me,

17:25.364 --> 17:27.056
you got my cell. Call me.

17:27.067 --> 17:28.517
Will do.

17:49.083 --> 17:52.215
Billy Gatwood meeting
notes. Contact Gatwood Oil.

17:52.226 --> 17:55.567
Get names and numbers for
New Mexico rights holders...

18:00.179 --> 18:01.676
Shit!

19:01.454 --> 19:03.321
No, no, no, no!

19:03.323 --> 19:05.456
No, no, no! Shit!

19:30.261 --> 19:33.313
Continuing notes from
Gatwood Oil meeting.

19:33.324 --> 19:35.566
Contact rights holders,

19:35.577 --> 19:37.566
begin scheduling.

20:01.314 --> 20:02.747
Howard!

20:05.116 --> 20:09.153
- What are you doing here, Jimmy?
- We have business to discuss.

20:09.155 --> 20:11.055
Is this about Chuck?

20:11.057 --> 20:12.857
Who?

20:12.859 --> 20:15.536
If you actually have business,
then call my secretary.

20:15.547 --> 20:18.262
I did. She stonewalled
me, as if you didn't know.

20:18.264 --> 20:19.720
Sandpiper.

20:19.731 --> 20:21.833
- What about it?
- It's time to settle.

20:21.835 --> 20:23.449
I-I saw the current offer.

20:23.460 --> 20:26.355
The clients make their losses
back, plus a solid chunk of change.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.370
Not that it's any of your business,

20:29.381 --> 20:32.170
but we project a final number
far higher than the current offer.

20:32.181 --> 20:33.983
I get it. I get it. You hold out,

20:33.994 --> 20:36.381
maybe you squeeze a grand
more for each client.

20:36.392 --> 20:38.639
Meanwhile, HHM nets a few million.

20:38.663 --> 20:41.511
You know, you're screwing the
clients for your own benefit.

20:41.522 --> 20:44.522
Oh, so now you're
worried about the clients?

20:44.524 --> 20:46.139
It's the right thing
to do, and you know it.

20:46.150 --> 20:47.659
Please.

20:47.670 --> 20:50.528
All you care about is
your share of the payout.

20:51.721 --> 20:53.795
It's like talking to Gollum.

20:53.806 --> 20:56.699
You're transparent. And pathetic.

20:58.138 --> 21:00.045
You want a handout?

21:01.506 --> 21:02.631
Here.

21:04.711 --> 21:05.936
Huh?

21:07.113 --> 21:08.917
Next time...

21:08.928 --> 21:10.748
why don't you bring a tin cup?

21:10.750 --> 21:12.663
It'd be more honest.

21:14.154 --> 21:16.754
Listen, Howard, settle
this and settle it now.

21:16.756 --> 21:18.522
It's in everyone's best interests!

21:18.533 --> 21:20.591
Meaning it's in your best interests.

21:20.593 --> 21:22.560
And if we don't, what are you gonna do?

21:22.562 --> 21:24.295
Peel off some members of the class,

21:24.297 --> 21:26.199
leak some insider info to Schweikart?

21:26.210 --> 21:28.399
Oh, I doubt it. I know you're low enough

21:28.401 --> 21:30.268
to do something like that,
but you're too damn greedy.

21:30.270 --> 21:31.510
You do any of that,

21:31.521 --> 21:33.815
and you'll be jeopardizing your payday.

21:34.808 --> 21:36.957
You'll get your damn money.

21:36.968 --> 21:38.760
You're just gonna have to wait for it.

22:25.634 --> 22:27.500
_

22:28.276 --> 22:31.096
_

22:31.120 --> 22:33.971
_

22:34.198 --> 22:37.925
_

22:39.198 --> 22:41.784
_

22:41.795 --> 22:45.546
_

22:45.557 --> 22:47.221
_

22:47.901 --> 22:50.862
_

22:50.925 --> 22:55.268
_

22:55.550 --> 22:57.917
_

23:06.288 --> 23:07.819
_

23:14.898 --> 23:16.656
_

23:17.772 --> 23:19.194
Don Hector...

23:19.205 --> 23:22.069
_

23:31.642 --> 23:33.224
Don Hector?

24:06.706 --> 24:10.612
_

24:10.674 --> 24:12.556
_

24:12.643 --> 24:14.448
_

25:05.140 --> 25:06.757
Well, we go around about,

25:06.780 --> 25:09.319
you know, six times, I think.

25:09.349 --> 25:13.827
I think we're... Yeah,
I think... I think so.

25:14.850 --> 25:16.311
I know!

25:16.322 --> 25:18.122
This is so good for you.

25:18.124 --> 25:19.366
Hello, ladies.

25:19.377 --> 25:20.825
Good morning.

25:20.827 --> 25:22.260
- Hi! Jimmy!
- Hi, Jimmy.

25:22.262 --> 25:23.628
Jimmy!

25:23.630 --> 25:26.197
Oh, y-you... you girls
go on a little bit.

25:26.199 --> 25:28.108
I'll... I'll catch up with you.

25:28.119 --> 25:29.351
Jimmy!

25:29.362 --> 25:30.647
Wow, Irene!

25:30.658 --> 25:32.937
Fancy running into
you twice in one week.

25:32.939 --> 25:34.372
How lucky am I?

25:34.374 --> 25:35.725
Y-You're a mall-walker?

25:35.736 --> 25:37.736
- I had no idea!
- Me?

25:37.747 --> 25:39.510
Oh, yeah. Big time.

25:39.512 --> 25:41.779
I mean, it's great for cardio.

25:41.781 --> 25:45.574
Hamstrings, glutes, I-T band.

25:45.585 --> 25:47.152
I'm a huge mall-walker.

25:47.163 --> 25:48.996
Been out of the game for awhile.

25:49.007 --> 25:50.855
Developed this damn plantar fasciitis.

25:50.857 --> 25:52.523
- Mnh. Mnh.
- Hurts like a bear.

25:52.525 --> 25:54.928
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about that.

25:54.939 --> 25:56.806
Well, hey.

25:56.817 --> 25:58.796
I got the cure right here.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.165
Pow!

26:01.167 --> 26:04.836
These have a special
gel and resistance coils

26:04.838 --> 26:06.070
and buncha stuff.

26:06.072 --> 26:08.124
It's like walkin' on pillows.

26:08.135 --> 26:11.175
Well, they... they...
they look comfortable.

26:11.177 --> 26:12.577
You like 'em?

26:12.579 --> 26:15.847
Well, they... they're quite stylish.

26:15.849 --> 26:18.170
Hey, y'know what?

26:18.181 --> 26:20.470
I bought a pair for my
girlfriend, and they don't fit her.

26:20.481 --> 26:22.587
And the store has this...
wouldn't you know it?...

26:22.589 --> 26:24.755
- no-refunds policy.
- Oh.

26:24.757 --> 26:26.219
What size are you?

26:27.164 --> 26:29.985
7 1/2. 7 1/2.

26:31.641 --> 26:33.985
Oh, there we go.

26:41.574 --> 26:42.940
How does that feel?

26:42.942 --> 26:44.242
Oh!

26:45.488 --> 26:48.356
Oh, I-I see what you mean. They...

26:48.367 --> 26:52.677
They are so nice, and
they fit like a dream!

26:52.688 --> 26:55.520
But I-I can't take
these for free, Jimmy.

26:55.522 --> 26:57.185
Oh, please.

26:57.196 --> 26:59.733
There is one thing you could do for me?

26:59.744 --> 27:01.244
What's that?

27:01.563 --> 27:03.219
Don't tell the other
folks I gave 'em to ya.

27:03.230 --> 27:05.719
I don't want to look like
I'm playing favorites.

27:06.232 --> 27:08.892
- My lips are sealed.
- Then you go and enjoy those.

27:08.903 --> 27:10.197
I'm gonna go get my heart rate back up.

27:10.208 --> 27:11.947
- Oh, thank you!
- And I'll see you later.

27:11.965 --> 27:14.222
Thank you so much, Jimmy!

27:23.279 --> 27:25.377
... Right hand, friends...
the hand of love.

27:25.744 --> 27:27.418
Now, watch, and I'll show
you the story of life.

27:27.420 --> 27:29.546
You got some questions.
It's only natural.

27:29.557 --> 27:32.723
And the truth is, if Irene settles...

27:32.725 --> 27:34.725
you'd get some money.

27:36.072 --> 27:39.455
But, I mean, it's not like
you guys need it, right?

27:39.966 --> 27:42.697
On the other hand, I did
get a look at their offer.

27:42.708 --> 27:45.452
I don't want to speak
out of school, but...

27:45.463 --> 27:47.405
it's, uh...

27:48.150 --> 27:52.236
But I mean, hey, everyone's
situation is different.

27:52.650 --> 27:55.158
Maybe Irene just doesn't need the money.

27:55.182 --> 27:57.081
I mean, I don't know for a fact, but...

27:57.083 --> 28:00.111
when you see someone
buying nice new things...

28:00.122 --> 28:02.286
- Like those shoes.
- ... like those shoes.

28:02.288 --> 28:03.768
Uh-huh.

28:04.290 --> 28:06.591
Ah. I mean, those must
have cost a pretty penny.

28:06.593 --> 28:08.267
I mean, if she can afford those,

28:08.278 --> 28:09.927
she's walkin' on easy street.

28:09.929 --> 28:12.345
And there's something else...

28:12.595 --> 28:14.376
y'know. The lawyers.

28:14.387 --> 28:16.103
I mean...

28:16.165 --> 28:18.821
that's the lawyer's
share of the settlement.

28:18.832 --> 28:22.524
And your share is...
boop!... this much. Doo!

28:22.535 --> 28:27.578
If Irene holds out, the
lawyers get this much more...

28:27.580 --> 28:31.235
and you are gonna get this much more.

28:31.246 --> 28:33.529
Doesn't seem like much difference.

28:33.571 --> 28:36.191
I know, but that's how it works.

28:36.202 --> 28:37.935
And Irene knows it, too.

28:37.946 --> 28:40.154
I mean, the lawyers
have explained it to her.

28:40.165 --> 28:42.845
It's crazy, but it's all up to Irene.

28:42.876 --> 28:45.596
After all, she is the
Class Representative.

28:45.598 --> 28:48.199
Does that mean that she gets more?

28:48.201 --> 28:49.767
No. No.

28:49.769 --> 28:52.978
Just means in the eyes of
the court, she's special.

28:52.989 --> 28:56.440
She's like your
congressman or ambassador.

28:56.442 --> 28:58.309
Is there anything we can do?

28:58.311 --> 29:02.224
No. No. You can't do anything.

29:02.235 --> 29:03.648
I can't do anything.

29:05.075 --> 29:06.684
Only Irene.

29:08.388 --> 29:11.188
She probably knows what's best.

29:11.190 --> 29:14.358
I'm sure she's taking
your feelings into account.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.127
Hey, look at the big picture.

29:16.129 --> 29:19.153
Who needs money when you
got the moral high ground?

29:25.543 --> 29:27.189
Yoo-hoo!

29:27.200 --> 29:28.715
Rose!

29:29.475 --> 29:30.957
Helen!

29:31.903 --> 29:33.869
Ladies?!

29:33.880 --> 29:35.817
Ladies!

30:18.197 --> 30:19.803
Ignacio?

30:19.814 --> 30:21.631
_

30:23.366 --> 30:25.683
_

30:25.694 --> 30:27.465
_

30:29.155 --> 30:30.694
_

30:40.747 --> 30:42.335
Papa...

30:44.906 --> 30:47.523
_

30:47.820 --> 30:49.429
_

30:50.195 --> 30:51.609
_

30:51.687 --> 30:55.054
_

30:55.148 --> 30:58.007
_

31:02.375 --> 31:03.984
_

31:04.468 --> 31:06.593
_

31:11.643 --> 31:13.780
Hector Salamanca.

31:16.841 --> 31:18.944
Salamanca.

31:20.518 --> 31:23.163
_

31:27.532 --> 31:29.928
_

31:30.233 --> 31:32.022
_

31:32.033 --> 31:33.280
_

31:33.319 --> 31:35.866
_

31:37.014 --> 31:38.967
_

31:40.530 --> 31:44.248
_

31:45.616 --> 31:47.444
_

31:49.131 --> 31:50.780
_

31:51.116 --> 31:55.780
_

31:56.530 --> 31:58.451
_

32:00.530 --> 32:02.280
_

32:02.772 --> 32:05.647
_

32:09.756 --> 32:12.405
_

32:13.834 --> 32:17.397
_

32:23.287 --> 32:25.530
_

32:27.834 --> 32:29.389
_

32:34.537 --> 32:36.420
_

33:20.994 --> 33:23.518
Okay, and I'm still waiting
for those third-party subpoenas.

33:23.529 --> 33:25.049
Oh, great. Let me know, then.

33:25.060 --> 33:26.277
- Thanks, Francis.
- All right.

33:26.279 --> 33:28.979
- Julie, what's up?
- From Chuck.

33:28.981 --> 33:30.981
It came via messenger...
the instructions say

33:30.983 --> 33:33.533
he wants you to read
it as soon as possible.

33:35.455 --> 33:36.697
Mm-hmm.

33:37.244 --> 33:38.989
Uh, here's what I need you to do.

33:38.991 --> 33:42.726
Call around. Find someplace
special for the retirement party.

33:42.728 --> 33:44.595
Something classy, old-school.

33:44.597 --> 33:46.297
Uh, La Posada, maybe.

33:46.299 --> 33:49.608
And a band. Something jazzy. Upbeat.

33:49.619 --> 33:50.775
Find what's available.

33:50.786 --> 33:52.173
- Let's set it up.
- Okay.

34:06.154 --> 34:07.990
Goddamit, Chuck.

34:10.443 --> 34:12.568
You're suing Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill?

34:12.579 --> 34:14.286
Come on in, Howard.

34:18.023 --> 34:19.668
You turned the lights on.

34:19.679 --> 34:23.199
I told you... I'm back to normal.

34:23.202 --> 34:26.681
And yes, I am suing HHM
for breach of contract.

34:26.693 --> 34:28.701
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

34:28.712 --> 34:30.474
I believe I do.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.443
I'm calling your bluff.

34:32.445 --> 34:35.213
This is my firm. I built it.

34:35.224 --> 34:38.681
Your father was working in a
two-room office when I joined him.

34:38.684 --> 34:41.690
And you I tutored for the bar exam.

34:41.701 --> 34:43.120
You're not kicking me out.

34:43.121 --> 34:45.456
If you can't "trust my
judgment," as you say,

34:45.458 --> 34:46.790
so be it,

34:46.792 --> 34:49.735
but you're gonna have
to pay me for my share.

34:49.746 --> 34:52.795
I believe it comes to around $8 million.

34:52.797 --> 34:55.418
We both know the firm
doesn't have the money.

34:56.771 --> 34:59.705
You'd rather tear down HHM than retire?

34:59.716 --> 35:02.631
You think I'm trouble
now? As your partner?

35:02.642 --> 35:04.732
Imagine me as your enemy.

35:09.164 --> 35:10.497
Chuck...

35:11.359 --> 35:12.883
the damage that you're going to do...

35:12.885 --> 35:14.875
If you'd like to discuss this further,

35:14.886 --> 35:17.098
we can... in court.

35:17.109 --> 35:18.689
Until then...

35:19.539 --> 35:22.059
what else is there to say?

35:40.516 --> 35:42.546
Blue pot. Red wine.

35:42.548 --> 35:44.348
Black burner.

35:44.350 --> 35:46.383
Blue pot. Red wine.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.117
Black burner. Blue pot.
Red wine. Black burner.

36:38.606 --> 36:40.306
I got hot hands.

36:40.308 --> 36:43.051
I got hot hands! I know
this is gonna be the one!

36:43.062 --> 36:45.445
B-9!

36:45.493 --> 36:49.919
Let's hope that biopsy comes back "B-9."

36:49.930 --> 36:51.512
B-9.

36:54.903 --> 36:57.083
Okay... what's next?

36:58.438 --> 37:00.637
We got... I-29.

37:00.648 --> 37:03.028
I remember when I was 29.

37:03.039 --> 37:05.273
Bet you do, too.

37:05.284 --> 37:07.615
I-29.

37:13.301 --> 37:16.895
Here comes O-62.

37:17.872 --> 37:19.579
Oh, my God.

37:19.581 --> 37:21.926
Have I called 62 of these already?

37:21.937 --> 37:25.051
It feels like it. O-62.

37:26.028 --> 37:28.262
Here we have B-2.

37:28.273 --> 37:29.708
B-2.

37:29.719 --> 37:32.425
Well, tonight is all bingo.

37:32.427 --> 37:33.770
Here it comes.

37:33.781 --> 37:36.429
O-70. Anyone? O-70.

37:37.051 --> 37:39.153
All right. No takers.

37:39.164 --> 37:40.708
Boom!

37:41.270 --> 37:42.869
G-55.

37:42.871 --> 37:44.271
G-55.

37:44.273 --> 37:45.939
Oh, my God! Bingo!

37:45.941 --> 37:47.278
I got bingo!

37:47.289 --> 37:49.509
Big Paul, bring it up.

37:49.511 --> 37:51.181
Kelly, take a look.

37:51.192 --> 37:53.661
We may have a winner.

37:54.243 --> 37:57.098
Kelly, tell me... have we got it?

37:57.109 --> 37:58.405
We have a bingo!

37:58.416 --> 38:00.883
Paul, step up to the winner's circle.

38:00.894 --> 38:02.262
Let's hear it for him!

38:02.273 --> 38:04.506
Let's give him a big round of applause!

38:06.795 --> 38:09.129
Okay. New game, new cards.

38:09.131 --> 38:10.630
Here they come.

38:10.632 --> 38:13.012
Get yourself some new cards. New cards.

38:14.670 --> 38:17.260
The helpers have them.
You can have one, two.

38:17.271 --> 38:19.575
You can have up to four, as you know.

38:19.973 --> 38:22.767
Here's a lucky blue one for you.

38:22.778 --> 38:26.278
All right. Take your cards
so we can start a new game.

38:26.280 --> 38:29.247
There you go. Add that to your stack.

38:30.380 --> 38:31.917
All right. Get your cards.

38:31.919 --> 38:34.470
Hey, Irene, you feeling lucky today?

38:34.481 --> 38:36.088
I-I guess so.

38:36.090 --> 38:38.824
All right. Well, here's one on me...

38:38.826 --> 38:40.292
just for you.

38:41.098 --> 38:46.192
All right. I sold my
soul for B-I-N-G-and-O!

38:46.700 --> 38:49.231
Let's clear the table.

39:08.757 --> 39:10.242
Load it up.

39:16.734 --> 39:18.463
Locked and loaded.

39:25.538 --> 39:27.557
Here comes a new game.

39:32.312 --> 39:34.813
First number up...

39:36.804 --> 39:39.409
it's N-31.

39:39.420 --> 39:40.960
"N" for "Nancy."

39:40.971 --> 39:44.184
31 for the number of times
she told me to take a hike.

39:44.195 --> 39:47.132
N-31.

39:49.367 --> 39:51.145
G-48.

39:51.156 --> 39:53.609
"G" for the Greatest Generation.

39:53.620 --> 39:56.735
48 for "Dewey Defeats Truman."

39:56.737 --> 40:00.270
Here's I-25... the big "I."

40:00.281 --> 40:01.824
I-25.

40:01.874 --> 40:05.744
It's B-12, like the vitamin.

40:13.797 --> 40:15.387
O-67!

40:15.389 --> 40:18.532
Anybody? I got a good
feeling about this.

40:18.543 --> 40:21.133
O-67!

40:22.977 --> 40:26.357
I-I-I think... Bingo!

40:26.368 --> 40:27.632
Who is that?

40:27.634 --> 40:29.204
Come on up.

40:29.961 --> 40:34.161
Irene! Irene, come on up here, dear.

40:34.172 --> 40:36.880
Bring it up to Kelly. Let's take a look.

40:36.891 --> 40:39.144
Kelly has to check your card.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.080
Here she comes.

40:47.633 --> 40:49.477
Could be...

40:52.125 --> 40:54.426
Oh, my goodness.

40:54.428 --> 40:58.396
It is a bingo for Irene!

40:58.398 --> 41:00.599
Let's hear it for Irene Landry!

41:02.477 --> 41:05.665
Give it up for the big
winner, Irene Landry!

41:07.307 --> 41:09.587
Fastest bingo of the night!

41:09.598 --> 41:12.077
Come on. Let's hear it for Irene.

41:12.079 --> 41:13.363
Oh!

41:15.015 --> 41:16.215
Irene...

41:16.226 --> 41:17.274
where ya goin'?

41:17.285 --> 41:19.481
Hey, you know what? Take over.

41:21.027 --> 41:23.255
Okay. Time for a new game.

41:23.257 --> 41:26.141
Uh, let's get some
cards out for everyone.

41:31.676 --> 41:33.014
Hey.

41:33.025 --> 41:35.097
What's going on? You okay?

41:37.043 --> 41:39.110
Aww. Don't do that.

41:39.121 --> 41:42.043
Your mascara's gonna run all over.

41:44.285 --> 41:46.478
Irene, come on.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.238
What's wrong?

41:50.117 --> 41:52.738
They've all turned on me.

41:54.070 --> 41:55.670
Who has?

41:56.123 --> 41:57.821
My friends!

41:57.858 --> 42:01.032
Helen, Rose, Myrtle.

42:01.043 --> 42:03.360
All of them.

42:03.371 --> 42:05.821
What? No!

42:05.832 --> 42:07.840
Yes!

42:09.136 --> 42:11.488
They're so cold.

42:12.629 --> 42:16.423
When I walk past them,
they stop talking.

42:16.425 --> 42:18.301
I-I-I hear them whispering

42:18.312 --> 42:21.146
when... when they think I'm not there.

42:21.148 --> 42:23.746
It's just so...

42:23.917 --> 42:25.470
- It's so cruel.
- Mnh.

42:25.481 --> 42:27.652
And I don't even know why.

42:32.637 --> 42:34.926
I think, uh...

42:34.928 --> 42:37.028
maybe I do.

42:38.837 --> 42:40.702
You do?

42:44.180 --> 42:46.755
Could it be the settlement?

42:46.766 --> 42:49.450
I mean, maybe they...

42:49.461 --> 42:51.833
want the money,

42:51.844 --> 42:55.364
you know, to improve their lives?

42:55.375 --> 42:58.550
I had no idea any of them needed money.

42:58.552 --> 43:00.752
No one said anything to me.

43:00.754 --> 43:03.254
Well, maybe it's not
about the money itself.

43:03.256 --> 43:07.726
I mean... hello... who
wouldn't want more money?

43:07.728 --> 43:10.297
I mean, maybe it's the idea

43:10.308 --> 43:15.453
that they don't think you're
considering them, you know?

43:16.110 --> 43:18.236
Thinking of their needs?

43:18.238 --> 43:20.639
I-I-I didn't know.

43:20.641 --> 43:23.969
I don't want to hurt
them. They're my friends.

43:26.914 --> 43:29.381
I wish we never even
started this lawsuit.

43:29.383 --> 43:32.466
I just want everything
to go back the way it was.

43:35.477 --> 43:38.172
What should I do?

43:38.868 --> 43:41.407
What would you do?

43:43.563 --> 43:47.071
I mean, you know I'm
not a lawyer right now.

43:47.821 --> 43:49.601
Please?

43:51.062 --> 43:53.133
Should I settle?

43:57.469 --> 43:59.244
Irene...

44:02.662 --> 44:04.774
you listen to your heart.

44:16.928 --> 44:18.830
Uh, time?

44:18.832 --> 44:20.098
Two hours out.

44:20.100 --> 44:21.633
When did I say I was gonna leave?

44:21.635 --> 44:23.301
20 minutes ago.

44:24.038 --> 44:26.565
Uh, can I have some more coffee, please?

44:26.576 --> 44:28.389
Coming.

44:33.380 --> 44:36.372
Uh, I'm missing a survey
history in this one.

44:36.383 --> 44:38.911
On it. Sorry about that.

44:38.922 --> 44:40.458
Not a problem.

44:40.469 --> 44:42.153
Hey!

44:42.155 --> 44:44.656
Who's ready to have her life changed?

44:44.658 --> 44:46.191
Kim, did you hear me?

44:46.193 --> 44:48.259
Yep. Heard you. Life changed.

44:48.270 --> 44:52.063
Stop your work, both of you, for a sec.

44:52.065 --> 44:53.732
I-I got big, big news.

44:53.734 --> 44:55.567
Can you just tell us later, Jimmy?

44:55.569 --> 44:58.318
- I'm so late, it's not even funny.
- Mesa Verde can wait.

44:58.329 --> 45:01.172
- Look. I got Zafiro.
- It's not Mesa Verde.

45:01.174 --> 45:03.541
It's a new client, and if I mess
this up, it's a former client.

45:03.543 --> 45:05.643
I thought Mesa Verde
was your one and only.

45:05.645 --> 45:07.545
You know, it's go...
Ji... uh, I'm sorry.

45:07.556 --> 45:09.571
Jimmy, can I just explain
all this to you later? I'm...

45:09.582 --> 45:11.790
Sandpiper is settling.

45:12.419 --> 45:14.740
- What?
- Yeah.

45:14.751 --> 45:16.383
For a bundle.

45:17.282 --> 45:19.090
But th-they can't be settling.

45:19.092 --> 45:21.092
Class actions don't move that fast.

45:21.094 --> 45:23.328
Don't get bogged down in the details!

45:23.353 --> 45:26.071
Trust me... they're settling!

45:27.638 --> 45:28.904
Wow, that...

45:28.915 --> 45:30.683
- Yeah. Yeah!
- That's great, then.

45:30.694 --> 45:32.537
So, hey, let's celebrate.

45:32.539 --> 45:34.066
I can tell that you...

45:34.077 --> 45:36.374
pulled another
all-nighter here, you know?

45:36.376 --> 45:38.910
You... you got to stop
and smell the roses.

45:38.912 --> 45:41.913
Hey, who's got two
thumbs, a bottle of Zafiro,

45:41.915 --> 45:43.847
and 20% of the common fund?!

45:43.858 --> 45:45.049
- Huh?
- This guy!

45:45.051 --> 45:47.519
I know... you do. Uh, I
am happy for you, Jimmy.

45:47.521 --> 45:48.853
Be happy for us!

45:48.855 --> 45:51.167
This is the solution to everything.

45:51.178 --> 45:52.702
Okay, Francesca, could you
just put these all in my car?

45:52.713 --> 45:54.241
Kim.

45:54.252 --> 45:55.511
Yeah. Jimmy, I gotta go.

45:55.522 --> 45:57.417
Gimme five goddamn minutes.

45:57.428 --> 45:59.178
- I don't have five minutes.
- But you're already late.

45:59.189 --> 46:01.933
What's five more minutes?
So drive 60 instead of 55.

46:01.935 --> 46:03.546
- Jimmy!
- What?

46:03.557 --> 46:05.056
You're not hearing me.

46:05.067 --> 46:06.905
Our troubles are over! Come on!

46:06.907 --> 46:08.628
Jimmy, I'm leaving now.

46:08.639 --> 46:09.908
I'll be back in a few hours.

46:09.919 --> 46:11.108
Think of all the things
you want to say to me,

46:11.119 --> 46:12.735
and just say them to me later, okay?

46:12.746 --> 46:14.124
Bye.

46:25.671 --> 46:27.775
You. Shots.

46:27.809 --> 46:30.193
- Uh, I...
- Shots.

46:30.204 --> 46:32.070
We're celebrating.

46:38.044 --> 46:40.238
Cheers.

46:43.505 --> 46:44.786
Smooth.

46:47.981 --> 46:49.396
Yeah.

46:53.950 --> 46:57.922
Under the terms we're offering,
you get a substantial payment

46:57.924 --> 47:01.213
without any impact to your property
via drilling and extraction.

47:01.224 --> 47:02.594
And rather than waiting years to close,

47:02.596 --> 47:06.275
Mr. Gatwood is offering cash
on the barrel, right now.

47:06.286 --> 47:09.377
Given the cost of overhead, liabilities,

47:09.388 --> 47:11.669
and other burdens Mr. Gatwood assumes,

47:11.671 --> 47:14.232
we believe this offer is more than fair.

47:14.243 --> 47:15.839
We believe...

47:16.326 --> 47:19.841
we believe this offer is more than fair.

48:01.194 --> 48:02.879
Aah!
