WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:02.433
Well, I could walk you through
the changes, but...

00:02.433 --> 00:03.766
(mouths "oh, thank you")

00:03.766 --> 00:06.500
You know, it would just be
easier if I did it myself.

00:06.500 --> 00:07.466
(tight inhale)

00:07.466 --> 00:09.566
Okay,
send it over.

00:09.566 --> 00:10.566
Thanks. bye.

00:12.266 --> 00:13.333
Julianne:
Whoa-whoa-whoa.

00:13.333 --> 00:14.500
I'm sorry, you haven't
done them yet?!

00:14.500 --> 00:16.200
You haven't filed
the press release,

00:16.200 --> 00:18.266
or taken the cover art
to the printer.

00:18.266 --> 00:21.100
Have you done anything
that I asked?

00:21.100 --> 00:23.100
I made your latte.

00:27.266 --> 00:28.200
Agh!

00:28.200 --> 00:29.300
Erica:
You know, how 'bout--

00:29.300 --> 00:31.400
Give me the copying
and the filing.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.300
The latte,
I can't help you with.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.733
Oh, you,
you are my fave.

00:34.733 --> 00:37.266
And you? You're fired!

00:38.400 --> 00:40.466
Erica: The world
is full of problems.

00:40.466 --> 00:42.033
Fix one.

00:42.033 --> 00:47.000
And you'll find another
just waiting to take its place.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.100
Mom? I got those boxes
you asked for.

00:51.566 --> 00:52.766
I thought you
weren't coming.

00:52.766 --> 00:55.166
Well, I didn't wanna
leave you in the lurch,

00:55.166 --> 00:56.166
but clearly,

00:57.200 --> 00:59.000
You really
need my help.

00:59.000 --> 00:59.666
(half laughs)

00:59.666 --> 01:01.166
You think
I over did it?

01:01.166 --> 01:03.166
Yes, mom,
you over did it.

01:03.166 --> 01:06.033
The whole family is coming here
tomorrow for the bris

01:06.033 --> 01:07.300
and it
looks like a--

01:07.300 --> 01:09.100
Like a flea
market exploded.

01:09.100 --> 01:09.600
(shocked gasp)

01:09.600 --> 01:11.366
Oh!

01:11.366 --> 01:13.000
You know what?
It'll be fine.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.033
It'll be absolutely fine.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.200
I have everything
under control.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.433
I do.

01:18.433 --> 01:20.366
And thank you so much
for bringing me those boxes.

01:20.366 --> 01:21.400
Mom, I'm not leaving.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.366
You can't do all this
all by yourself,

01:23.366 --> 01:24.366
it's too much work.

01:24.366 --> 01:25.500
Wha-no.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.300
Man:
Hey, where do these go?

01:27.300 --> 01:28.533
Who is that?

01:28.533 --> 01:31.233
Is there a man here?

01:33.233 --> 01:34.400
Mom?

01:34.400 --> 01:37.733
Uh, Erica, it's--
That's--

01:37.733 --> 01:39.700
Okay, here it is,
I'm seeing someone.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.733
And when you told me
you couldn't come,

01:41.733 --> 01:43.366
I called
him in a panic.

01:43.366 --> 01:44.466
You're seeing someone?

01:44.466 --> 01:45.666
(stammers excitedly)

01:45.666 --> 01:47.433
Like, a boyfriend?

01:47.433 --> 01:48.633
(small, excited squeal)

01:48.633 --> 01:49.300
Hello?

01:49.300 --> 01:51.466
No, Erica, please.

01:52.433 --> 01:53.166
Hi there.

01:53.166 --> 01:54.466
Hello.

01:54.466 --> 01:56.466
Norm, this is my oldest
daughter, Erica.

01:56.466 --> 01:58.300
Norm: You must be
the hotshot editor,

01:58.300 --> 01:59.500
I've heard
so much about.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.633
Norm, it's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

02:01.633 --> 02:03.466
Norm: You sticking
around for a bit?

02:03.466 --> 02:05.066
We could sure use
your help.

02:05.066 --> 02:06.400
Of course.

02:09.733 --> 02:11.266
(chuckles)

02:12.633 --> 02:15.433
So listen, why didn't you
tell me you had a boyfriend?

02:15.433 --> 02:16.566
I--

02:16.566 --> 02:18.366
Uh, lonely planet's
guide to Argentina?

02:18.366 --> 02:20.500
Uh, donate, please.

02:23.300 --> 02:24.300
Mom?

02:25.566 --> 02:29.000
I was worried
you'd be upset.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.500
Are you crazy?!
I mean, he seems so nice.

02:31.500 --> 02:33.500
Oh, he is, Erica.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.100
Do you
think it'd be okay

02:35.100 --> 02:37.533
if I invited him
to the bris?

02:37.533 --> 02:39.200
Of course.
Why wouldn't it be?

02:39.200 --> 02:41.333
I don't know,
circumcising a baby,

02:41.333 --> 02:44.533
it might not be the best way
to introduce him to the family.

02:44.533 --> 02:47.266
Uh, especially since
your ex-husband is the mohel.

02:47.266 --> 02:48.266
Oh.

02:48.266 --> 02:49.200
There's no saying
what he'll do

02:49.200 --> 02:50.400
with those
sharp instruments.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.000
And if I do invite Norm,

02:52.000 --> 02:54.400
then I have to tell
your father beforehand.

02:54.400 --> 02:58.000
I can't just
blindside him and--

02:58.000 --> 03:00.533
Ah, forget it.
It's too much trouble.

03:00.533 --> 03:02.033
It's okay.

03:02.033 --> 03:03.633
Erica: In a world
where problems abound,

03:03.633 --> 03:05.233
many of us
are professional fixers.

03:05.233 --> 03:06.633
Well, I,
I could tell dad.

03:06.633 --> 03:09.500
You know, it might be easier
if I let him know.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.300
You wouldn't mind?

03:10.300 --> 03:11.333
No, of course not.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.300
And I'll take this box
to him, too.

03:13.300 --> 03:16.300
It's one less thing
for you to worry about.

03:16.300 --> 03:17.533
Whenever we
see a problem,

03:17.533 --> 03:19.133
a need,
a kernel of unhappiness,

03:19.133 --> 03:21.733
we have to get in there.
We have to fix it.

03:21.733 --> 03:24.366
Thank you, sweetheart.

03:24.366 --> 03:26.766
Erica: In our rush to fix,
to help, to solve,

03:26.766 --> 03:28.566
most of us never
pause to wonder

03:28.566 --> 03:30.366
if we're doing
the right thing.

03:30.366 --> 03:31.600
Because after all,

03:31.600 --> 03:34.133
how could trying to help
someone be wrong?

Hello?

04:28.166 --> 04:31.733
Hey, look who came
to make my day.

04:31.733 --> 04:32.633
Here you go.

04:32.633 --> 04:33.700
What's this?

04:33.700 --> 04:37.700
Oh, mom is doing a big
pre-bris clean up.

04:37.700 --> 04:39.600
Thank you, sweetheart.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.433
I was gonna just
barbecue for myself,

04:41.433 --> 04:43.733
but if you wanna
stay for dinner?

04:43.733 --> 04:45.533
Oh, I can't.

04:45.533 --> 04:47.300
I-I'm sorry,
I would love to,

04:47.300 --> 04:49.300
but I told Ethan
I'd be home and--

04:49.300 --> 04:50.333
That's okay.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.500
I am gonna see you
tomorrow anyway.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.633
Don't be late.

04:52.633 --> 04:54.733
I don't want you to miss
your dad in action.

04:54.733 --> 04:57.466
Uh, and
about tomorrow, it's--

04:57.466 --> 04:59.666
I mean, it's not
a big deal, but I--

04:59.666 --> 05:02.200
I just thought that
you should know that, um--

05:02.200 --> 05:04.666
Mom, she's seeing
someone.

05:05.733 --> 05:07.000
His name is Norm

05:07.000 --> 05:08.766
and he's gonna be
at the bris tomorrow.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.300
Your mom's been by herself
for far too long,

05:15.300 --> 05:17.133
so good for her.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.066
Really?

05:19.066 --> 05:20.533
Of course.
It's great news.

05:20.533 --> 05:22.166
Oh, wow!

05:22.166 --> 05:22.700
Wha--?

05:22.700 --> 05:24.200
You remember this?!

05:24.200 --> 05:26.400
I know, we couldn't remember
if that was Leo's,

05:26.400 --> 05:27.600
or yours, or...

05:27.600 --> 05:29.233
Erica, I bought this
for your 10th birthday.

05:29.233 --> 05:31.066
We use to go out
every night

05:31.066 --> 05:35.333
and hunt the sky
for hidden planets and ufos.

05:36.166 --> 05:37.166
You don't remember?

05:37.166 --> 05:38.633
Yeah, no, of course,
I remember, dad.

05:38.633 --> 05:39.666
S-sorry.

05:39.666 --> 05:42.200
That was years ago,
why would you?

05:43.200 --> 05:45.666
Out with the old,
in with the new, right?

05:45.666 --> 05:47.300
Dad.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.300
I'll see you tomorrow.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.200
(mouse double clicks)

06:09.433 --> 06:12.166
(mouse key clicks,
Erica exhales)

06:12.733 --> 06:14.133
J-date?

06:14.133 --> 06:16.233
Uh-oh, is this your way
of telling me it's over?

06:16.233 --> 06:17.433
(half laughs)

06:17.433 --> 06:19.266
Stop it,
I'm looking for my dad.

06:19.266 --> 06:20.633
Ethan:
Okay, that's kinda creepy.

06:20.633 --> 06:23.666
Erica: No, it's not creepy.
I mean he's lonely.

06:23.666 --> 06:25.233
He needs
to meet someone.

06:25.233 --> 06:27.766
Erica, your dad's love life,
or lack thereof,

06:27.766 --> 06:29.200
it's not your problem.

06:29.200 --> 06:30.300
No, I know.
It's--

06:30.300 --> 06:31.700
It's just, mom,
she has Norm,

06:31.700 --> 06:33.300
and Sam
has London.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.066
(inhales and exhales)

06:35.066 --> 06:37.633
Ethan: Hey, what
do you think, hm?

06:37.633 --> 06:38.333
Oh.

06:38.333 --> 06:41.300
(laughs)

06:41.300 --> 06:43.066
What are you wearing?

06:43.066 --> 06:44.666
Ethan:
It's my cool new kippah.

06:44.666 --> 06:46.600
And this tablecloth thing,
I rented.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.666
(laughs)

06:47.666 --> 06:49.133
Ethan: What?
It's too much, isn't it?

06:49.133 --> 06:50.400
Erica:
No!

06:50.400 --> 06:52.666
No, not for
the wailing wall.

06:52.666 --> 06:55.266
But, hey you,
you get an "A" for effort.

06:55.266 --> 06:56.666
(telephone rings)

06:58.600 --> 06:59.600
Mm.

07:00.666 --> 07:01.400
Hi.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.000
Barbara:
Hi, honey.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.200
S-so I told dad
about Norm.

07:07.533 --> 07:08.466
And?

07:08.466 --> 07:10.100
And he--
He took it pretty well.

07:10.100 --> 07:12.266
Barbara: Well, good.
That's a relief.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.366
Thank you, Erica.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.766
And I hate to do this,

07:14.766 --> 07:17.233
but I have one more
favour to ask you.

07:17.233 --> 07:18.466
Mm-hm.

07:18.466 --> 07:20.066
Barbara: Your cousin Elliot
has swine flu.

07:20.066 --> 07:21.766
Now,
he's gonna be fine,

07:21.766 --> 07:24.166
but he was supposed to be
the sandek, right?

07:24.166 --> 07:27.166
What, are you asking me
to fill in?

07:27.166 --> 07:29.433
Barbara: Honey, it would mean
so much to Stephanie.

07:29.433 --> 07:30.433
Mom,
can't, you know--

07:30.433 --> 07:32.200
Can't Aunt Roberta
hold the baby?

07:32.200 --> 07:34.266
And, of course,
your father would be thrilled

07:34.266 --> 07:36.666
if you were to take on
a more meaningful role

07:36.666 --> 07:38.066
during the ceremony.

07:40.166 --> 07:41.166
Uh--

07:42.233 --> 07:43.533
Okay, yeah, I'll do it.

07:43.533 --> 07:45.466
Barbara: Thank you, sweetheart.
I'll let her know.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.466
Bye-bye.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.300
Bye.

07:49.533 --> 07:52.033
Hey,
is everything okay?

07:52.700 --> 07:54.166
What's the big deal?

07:54.166 --> 07:55.766
Isn't being the sandek
like being the godmother?

07:55.766 --> 07:57.366
No,
it is nothing like that.

07:57.366 --> 07:58.633
The sandek
is the person

07:58.633 --> 08:01.033
that has to sit there
and hold the baby

08:01.033 --> 08:04.200
while the mohel,
aka my father,

08:04.200 --> 08:05.200
circumcises him.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.200
So, it's two seconds,
who cares?

08:07.200 --> 08:08.533
Who cares?

08:11.266 --> 08:13.133
Kai? How much
for the biscotti?

08:13.133 --> 08:14.733
Uh, for you,
it's on the house.

08:14.733 --> 08:16.333
Great. thanks.

08:18.033 --> 08:20.500
(paper bag crinkles,
Erica hums to herself)

08:22.766 --> 08:25.233
Can I borrow a knife?

08:26.266 --> 08:27.266
Uh--

08:28.300 --> 08:30.233
Yeah, go crazy.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
See this penis I'm holding
in my hand?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.266
That is not a penis.

08:35.266 --> 08:38.233
How would you feel
if you had to hold a baby down

08:38.233 --> 08:40.066
while your
dad did this?

08:40.066 --> 08:43.400
Foreskin, scalpel,
circumcision.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.400
I don't understand
why I'm the only one

08:45.400 --> 08:47.233
that thinks that
circumcising a baby

08:47.233 --> 08:48.433
is brutal, violent
and wrong!

08:48.433 --> 08:50.333
Okay, okay, I get it!

08:50.333 --> 08:52.133
Please, just stop.

08:52.133 --> 08:53.566
Why didn't you
just say no?

08:53.566 --> 08:55.666
Because Stephanie
asked me to.

08:55.666 --> 08:56.666
So?

08:57.366 --> 08:58.600
So, I mean, it's just--

08:58.600 --> 09:00.600
Ethan, it's a really
important day for her.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.200
And if I can make her happy
and I can make my dad happy,

09:04.200 --> 09:06.100
then I should.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.033
(deep calming breath)

09:07.033 --> 09:08.533
I just have
to get through it.

09:08.533 --> 09:10.233
Kai:
Are you, uh--

09:10.233 --> 09:12.633
All finished
with that knife?

09:13.333 --> 09:14.333
Thank you.

09:21.233 --> 09:22.433
You're armed.

09:22.433 --> 09:24.066
Should I be concerned?

09:24.066 --> 09:25.200
I am at work.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.200
You can't just keep
pulling me in here.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.600
Why do you
keep doing this?

09:28.600 --> 09:30.000
Because you made
a commitment.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.633
I told you,
I changed my mind.

09:31.633 --> 09:32.700
And I told you,

09:32.700 --> 09:34.433
you don't get to
change your mind.

09:34.433 --> 09:37.100
That's not
how it works.

09:38.100 --> 09:41.000
Kai, I know you're used
to getting what you want.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.400
As far as I can tell,

09:42.400 --> 09:45.033
it hasn't made
your life any easier.

09:45.033 --> 09:46.266
You don't
actually know me.

09:46.266 --> 09:47.300
You ever think that

09:47.300 --> 09:49.100
just maybe you got it
all wrong?

09:49.100 --> 09:50.166
No.

09:50.166 --> 09:51.266
Kai, you turning
your back on this

09:51.266 --> 09:52.433
is not the answer.

09:52.433 --> 09:55.033
Just give it a chance.

09:56.566 --> 09:58.400
Let me help you.

09:59.433 --> 10:02.000
I don't want your help.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.666
I wanna be left alone.

10:04.666 --> 10:07.333
Walking out that door
isn't gonna change anything.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.233
You know why?

10:09.233 --> 10:13.400
Because you can't run away
from who you are.

10:14.433 --> 10:15.500
(slams shut)

10:15.500 --> 10:18.500
Yikes! Someone's
having a bad day.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.300
Um, will you
give me a sec?

10:20.300 --> 10:21.766
Ethan:
Yeah, sure.

10:21.766 --> 10:24.600
Erica:
Hey, Kai, are you okay?

10:24.600 --> 10:26.266
Did you just have
a session?

10:26.266 --> 10:27.466
I hate that guy,

10:27.466 --> 10:30.066
the way he acts like
he knows what's best for me.

10:30.066 --> 10:32.466
Like I'm this broken thing
that needs to be fixed.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.466
Well, did you tell him
how you feel?

10:34.466 --> 10:36.466
Are kidding me?
Of course, I told him.

10:36.466 --> 10:37.666
He doesn't listen to me.

10:37.666 --> 10:39.533
Okay, um,
Look--

10:39.533 --> 10:40.433
Maybe--

10:40.433 --> 10:41.700
I could
talk to my doctor

10:41.700 --> 10:43.533
and I could get him
to intervene,

10:43.533 --> 10:44.733
or you could--

10:44.733 --> 10:46.100
Erica,
just listen, I--

10:46.100 --> 10:47.300
It's not your problem,
okay?

10:47.300 --> 10:50.266
Thank you,
but just let it go.

10:50.266 --> 10:51.600
Co-worker:
Kai.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.533
You, uh, going
on break or what?

10:53.533 --> 10:55.633
Yeah,
I'm coming right now.

10:55.633 --> 10:56.600
This is Erica.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.366
Travis.
How's it going?

10:58.366 --> 11:01.300
Erica:
Hey, it's nice to meet you.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.200
(sighs heavily)

11:09.500 --> 11:11.266
"Lavalife." Really?

11:11.266 --> 11:14.100
Barbie, I had no idea
you were so hip.

11:14.100 --> 11:15.100
(laughs)

11:16.766 --> 11:18.233
Isn't he cute?

11:18.233 --> 11:19.166
Introduce me.

11:19.166 --> 11:20.066
Okay, let's go.

11:20.700 --> 11:23.100
(Erica exhales tensely)

11:23.100 --> 11:24.400
Dad!

11:24.400 --> 11:26.700
How's my partner?
It's you and me today.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.200
(gentle squeezing grunt)

11:28.200 --> 11:29.733
Picard
and number one.

11:29.733 --> 11:31.300
Heh. uh--

11:31.300 --> 11:32.700
Are you okay?
You seem nervous.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.300
Just a--
I mean, little bit.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.300
It'll be fine.
I'll walk you through it,

11:36.300 --> 11:37.700
explain everything.
Don't worry.

11:38.700 --> 11:39.700
Okay.

11:42.566 --> 11:44.333
So, that's him.

11:44.333 --> 11:45.366
Yeah.

11:45.366 --> 11:46.733
Well, he's a pretty
good looking guy.

11:46.733 --> 11:48.300
Jewish?

11:48.300 --> 11:50.600
No, I don't think so.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.166
(inhales deeply)

11:52.166 --> 11:53.733
Well,
you gonna introduce me?

11:53.733 --> 11:55.600
Yes. 'kay.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.066
Barbara: You know that little
place in Bayview Village?

11:58.066 --> 11:59.366
Aunt Roberta:
The tea shop?

11:59.366 --> 12:00.533
Barbara: Mm-hmm.

12:00.533 --> 12:01.700
Yeah, that's where
we had our first date.

12:01.700 --> 12:02.366
(murmuring quietly)

12:02.366 --> 12:03.033
(clears throat)

12:03.033 --> 12:03.733
Mom.

12:03.733 --> 12:05.566
Ah, the mohel
has arrived.

12:05.566 --> 12:06.433
Hello, Gary.

12:06.433 --> 12:07.233
Hi.

12:07.233 --> 12:08.466
Muah!

12:08.466 --> 12:09.700
Norm, this is Gary.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.000
Pleasure to meet you.

12:11.000 --> 12:11.766
You too.

12:30.233 --> 12:31.333
(preparatory breath)

12:31.333 --> 12:33.233
Gary: Since the time
of Abraham,

12:33.233 --> 12:35.166
the jewish people have
observed the tradition

12:35.166 --> 12:37.166
of the Brit Milah.

12:37.166 --> 12:41.100
It is the sign of God's
covenant with Israel.

12:41.100 --> 12:43.300
This ritual marks
baby Jonah's entry

12:43.300 --> 12:44.666
into the Jewish community.

12:49.733 --> 12:52.600
(circumcision instrument
clinks)

12:56.766 --> 12:58.333
Erica,

12:58.333 --> 13:01.000
please hold down his legs.

13:03.166 --> 13:05.400
That's right, like that.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.766
Now you have to
keep him very still.

13:07.766 --> 13:08.766
Okay?

13:12.166 --> 13:16.033
Now, just undo
his diapers and I'll--

13:17.200 --> 13:18.200
Erica?

13:21.300 --> 13:22.433
Erica?

13:22.433 --> 13:23.433
Erica!

13:23.766 --> 13:26.133
(shocked gasps)

13:28.233 --> 13:29.433
Dr. Fred:
You all right?

13:29.433 --> 13:31.000
Can I get
you something?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.600
A water?

13:32.600 --> 13:33.766
A juice?

13:35.133 --> 13:36.466
A vanilla latte?

13:43.233 --> 13:45.166
(uneasy breaths)

13:50.100 --> 13:52.100
Dr. Tom, what--

13:52.100 --> 13:54.333
What's going on?
Where, uh--

13:54.333 --> 13:55.200
Where are we?

13:55.200 --> 13:57.033
This is my office.

13:57.033 --> 14:00.033
Dr. Tom: Dr. Fred needs to talk
to you about something.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.500
It's okay.

14:04.066 --> 14:06.533
Dr. Fred? You're-
You're Kai's doctor?

14:06.533 --> 14:08.133
Yes and
I brought you here

14:08.133 --> 14:11.233
because I need to talk
to you about him.

14:11.233 --> 14:13.766
Our therapy has hit
a roadblock.

14:13.766 --> 14:15.100
No kidding.

14:17.266 --> 14:18.200
Sorry.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.333
No. huh.
Please, have a seat.

14:20.333 --> 14:21.533
Share your thoughts
with us.

14:22.266 --> 14:23.566
Um--

14:23.566 --> 14:25.700
Well, not to tell you
how to do your job or anything,

14:25.700 --> 14:27.233
but Kai is--

14:27.233 --> 14:29.266
He's not enjoying
your process.

14:29.266 --> 14:32.300
Which is a very polite way
of saying he hates my guts.

14:32.300 --> 14:33.333
Uh, he--

14:34.333 --> 14:37.100
He doesn't feel
that you understand him.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.566
Which is
where you come in.

14:38.566 --> 14:40.566
Or, more to the point,
you came in

14:40.566 --> 14:42.333
a few months ago,

14:42.333 --> 14:44.666
that day on the street.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.600
You're the one
that bumped into me!

14:46.600 --> 14:48.500
And you made me spill
my coffee

14:48.500 --> 14:50.300
so that I would go
to goblins

14:50.300 --> 14:52.166
And meet Kai
and befriend him

14:52.166 --> 14:54.266
and one day
walk into my office

14:54.266 --> 14:56.466
so I can
tell you that--

14:56.466 --> 14:59.433
That I really need
your help.

14:59.433 --> 15:00.633
Did you
know about this?

15:03.700 --> 15:06.400
Uh okay,
so you need my help?

15:06.400 --> 15:07.666
How?

15:07.666 --> 15:09.300
What am I
supposed to do?

15:09.300 --> 15:12.333
Kai is, as you know,
resisting therapy.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.400
He needs someone
to help him gain--

15:14.400 --> 15:16.100
Dr. Tom:
Perspective.

15:16.100 --> 15:18.233
On what
therapy can do.

15:18.233 --> 15:19.300
When it works.

15:19.300 --> 15:20.566
(half laughs, overwhelmed)

15:20.566 --> 15:21.700
I'm sorry,

15:21.700 --> 15:24.266
but this is a lot to take in
right now and--

15:24.266 --> 15:25.433
And to be honest,

15:25.433 --> 15:27.466
I don't like going behind
Kai's back on this.

15:27.466 --> 15:29.300
He's made it perfectly
clear to me

15:29.300 --> 15:32.400
that he doesn't want to discuss
the specifics of his therapy.

15:32.400 --> 15:35.333
Have you ever asked yourself
why that is, Erica?

15:35.333 --> 15:37.566
Or wondered maybe if--

15:37.566 --> 15:39.333
He's keeping something
from you?

15:41.566 --> 15:42.233
I--

15:42.233 --> 15:43.066
(exhales)

15:43.066 --> 15:44.466
I don't know
what to say.

15:44.466 --> 15:46.166
Dr. Fred:
Say you'll help.

15:46.166 --> 15:48.166
Say you'll at least
let me show you

15:48.166 --> 15:50.366
what I'm
talking about.

15:54.766 --> 15:55.766
Okay.

16:04.300 --> 16:05.300
Thank you, Tom.

16:05.300 --> 16:06.633
Dr. Tom:
Don't thank me.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.700
I'm not doing
this for you or Kai,

16:08.700 --> 16:10.400
I'm doing
this for Erica.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.433
And watch out for her.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.600
(mic feedback
squeals loudly)

16:21.266 --> 16:23.200
Kai: Jesus Christ!

16:23.200 --> 16:25.566
You asshole!
What the hell was that?!

16:25.566 --> 16:27.200
Kai, I am so sorry.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.166
Kai: You're sorry?

16:28.166 --> 16:29.233
Is this amateur hour?

16:29.233 --> 16:31.033
Kai, come on,
it was a mistake.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.300
Kai: Hey, I'm deaf!

16:32.300 --> 16:35.366
You're a rock star, bud.
It comes with the territory.

16:35.366 --> 16:37.533
I'm sorry,
I think that I, um--

16:37.533 --> 16:38.566
I stumbled and, uh--

16:38.566 --> 16:40.266
Kai:
You stumbled?

16:40.266 --> 16:42.066
Uh, what's
your name again?

16:42.066 --> 16:44.733
Producer: Kai, this is Noelle,
she's from rolling stone.

16:44.733 --> 16:46.200
Kai:
Oh, right.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.666
Well, you're just lucky
you're a real journalist,

16:47.666 --> 16:50.400
and not some gossip columnist
or the paparazzi.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.400
Punched out a few in my time,
but we'll let this slide.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.333
Producer:
Noelle.

16:54.333 --> 16:55.133
Yes.

16:55.133 --> 16:56.133
Producer: Have a seat.

16:56.133 --> 16:57.700
Can we get you
something to drink?

16:57.700 --> 16:59.433
Uh yeah.

16:59.433 --> 17:02.033
I think that would be--
That'd be a good idea.

17:02.033 --> 17:03.333

17:38.600 --> 17:41.033
Who's the man, huh?
Who is the man?

17:41.033 --> 17:43.066
You nailed it, my friend!
You nailed it.

17:43.066 --> 17:46.100
Kai: Yeah, as much as
you can nail a piece of shit.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.233
I need some water.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.700
Producer: Get the man
some water, pronto!

17:48.700 --> 17:51.000
Believe me,
that was not shit, Kai.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.333
That is gonna be
your new hit single.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.266
It is, trust me.

17:55.266 --> 17:56.666
(cell phone dials and rings)

17:56.666 --> 17:59.066
Man: Have you got
good news for me, Jody?

17:59.066 --> 18:01.633
Jody: Good news?
Shawn, I have got great news.

18:01.633 --> 18:03.366
Answer this:
what's better than gold?

18:03.366 --> 18:06.133
You got it - platinum.
Triple platinum.

18:06.133 --> 18:07.233
I'm serious.

18:07.233 --> 18:08.700
I just heard "Unwind"
and it was classic.

18:08.700 --> 18:10.500
The fans are gonna
eat it up.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.500
Nice.

18:14.766 --> 18:16.566
That what you think, Noelle?
Triple platinum?

18:16.566 --> 18:18.766
I thought that,
I thought that it was really...

18:18.766 --> 18:21.266
You know,
it's really catchy.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.533
Catchy? That's great.

18:22.533 --> 18:24.600
Anyone ever tell you,
you got a way with words?

18:24.600 --> 18:25.600
Hey, dickhead!

18:25.600 --> 18:27.233
I do enough damage
to my eardrums

18:27.233 --> 18:28.233
without your help,
buddy.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.566
Jody:
okay, Kai.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.266
This lovely lady would like
to start the interview,

18:31.266 --> 18:33.333
so, let's go, boys.

18:33.333 --> 18:35.733
(rustle of entourage leaving)

18:39.466 --> 18:40.633
Oh, thank you.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.633
Uh--

18:57.266 --> 18:58.300
Dr. Fred.

18:58.300 --> 19:00.033
Dr. Fred,
what is going on?

19:00.033 --> 19:02.333
It's all right, heh,
let her through.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.000
Give us
all some space.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.433
Okay, I'm freaking out.

19:09.433 --> 19:10.666
"Dr. Fred." Really?

19:10.666 --> 19:12.266
You trying
to blow my cover?

19:12.266 --> 19:14.366
What? Okay, wait, so...

19:14.366 --> 19:16.766
This is the future, right?
You sent me to 2017?

19:16.766 --> 19:18.033
2019, actually.

19:18.033 --> 19:19.633
Oh, 2019. great.
That's even better.

19:19.633 --> 19:21.100
This is
actually Kai's past

19:21.100 --> 19:22.666
and he's about to hit
rock-bottom.

19:22.666 --> 19:25.266
Kai and the band
are about to go on tour.

19:25.266 --> 19:27.633
Kai'll blow off
the first two gigs,

19:27.633 --> 19:29.333
he'll OD on opium,

19:29.333 --> 19:30.766
spend two weeks
in a coma,

19:30.766 --> 19:32.166
wake up, meet me,

19:32.166 --> 19:33.366
and his therapy will begin.

19:33.366 --> 19:34.733
Okay, just--
Wait a second.

19:34.733 --> 19:37.366
So, you're telling me that,
that the Kai that I know,

19:37.366 --> 19:39.100
the Kai from 2009,
barrista Kai,

19:39.100 --> 19:41.333
he's what--
He's on a session?

19:41.333 --> 19:44.233
A session
he's turned his back on.

19:44.233 --> 19:46.000
He's stranding himself
in 2009, Erica.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.400
You know, he was sent back
to complete a regret,

19:48.400 --> 19:50.633
and has decided
he doesn't wanna leave.

19:50.633 --> 19:53.266
He doesn't wanna
come back to all this.

19:53.266 --> 19:56.166
He-so,
he's not even 22.

19:56.166 --> 19:58.133
Thirty-two.

19:58.133 --> 20:00.600
And trust me,
despite the rock'n'roll bravado,

20:00.600 --> 20:04.066
he needs all the help
he can get.

20:05.500 --> 20:08.433
Now, you better run,
Kai's limo waits for no one,

20:08.433 --> 20:13.133
not even a reporter
from rolling stone magazine.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.000
(computer beeps)

20:21.066 --> 20:23.366
Erica:
Wow, nice limo.

20:23.366 --> 20:26.166
Jody: Hey, yeah,
totally retro.

20:26.166 --> 20:29.133
Kai's got a soft spot
for the turn of the century.

20:29.133 --> 20:30.566
We're glad to have you,
Noelle.

20:30.566 --> 20:33.433
Kai's been looking forward
to this interview for weeks.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.433
You know,
he's had a rough year, so--

20:35.433 --> 20:39.000
We hope your story can get him
back on track, you know?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.166
Come on.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.466
So you said that
it's been a rough year?

20:46.466 --> 20:47.600
Yeah,
it's been awful.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.200
All I read or hear about
is the o addiction,

20:50.200 --> 20:51.433
his rehab, Travis.

20:51.433 --> 20:53.133
You know,
it's never the music.

20:53.133 --> 20:55.766
Travis--
You mean his friend, Travis?

20:55.766 --> 20:57.566
Yeah,
his friend Travis.

20:57.566 --> 20:58.666
Who else?

20:58.666 --> 21:00.533
Sorry, I--
That was a stupid question.

21:00.533 --> 21:02.600
Jody:
It's okay, it's okay.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.733
Travis' suicide was incredibly
shocking to all of us.

21:05.733 --> 21:08.000
You know, and Kai took it
really hard.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.566
More than anyone, you know?
They were bandmates,

21:10.566 --> 21:11.766
they were
best friends, so.

21:11.766 --> 21:12.700
Erica: Right.

21:12.700 --> 21:13.700
Look,
like I told Trina,

21:13.700 --> 21:15.433
you know,
talking about suicide--

21:16.433 --> 21:17.700
Off limits, okay?

21:17.700 --> 21:21.033
I-look, I'm just here
to do a nice cover piece,

21:21.033 --> 21:23.366
and to learn
more about Kai.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.000
Jody:
Well, then.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.066
Looks like we're on
the same page.

21:27.066 --> 21:29.033
Kai: Oh, man,
I love hot reporters.

21:29.033 --> 21:30.366
There's the boy.

21:31.566 --> 21:33.066
Okay,
let's get started.

21:33.066 --> 21:35.466
I am an open book,
ask me anything you want.

21:35.466 --> 21:37.566
Okay, um--

21:37.566 --> 21:41.033
Let me just find
my tape recorder.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.100
Or a notepad, or--

21:45.500 --> 21:46.500
Right.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.000
Thank you.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.233
Okay,
where should we start?

21:49.233 --> 21:51.066
And where's
the on-switch?

21:53.566 --> 21:55.333
Right.

21:55.333 --> 21:56.333
(screen beeps)

21:59.600 --> 22:00.600
Testing, testing.

22:01.666 --> 22:03.366
(rock music plays)

22:03.366 --> 22:05.500
Kai: Uh, early childhood,
army brat.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.566
Moved around a lot.

22:06.566 --> 22:08.000
Finished high school
in Toronto,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.533
formed a band.

22:09.533 --> 22:12.133
That's my story,
I'm sticking to it.

22:12.133 --> 22:13.133
Okay.

22:15.433 --> 22:16.566
Let's, um--

22:16.566 --> 22:18.600
Let's talk about you
and your band.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.200
Oh, band's incredible.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.100
I love 'em.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.633
(laughs)

22:22.633 --> 22:24.633
We're one
big happy family.

22:24.633 --> 22:26.100
I see,
so everything's great.

22:26.100 --> 22:27.300
Kai: Oh, life's
amazing, Noelle.

22:27.300 --> 22:29.166
I wake up everyday inspired,
you know?

22:29.166 --> 22:31.566
And, uh, this is gonna be
the best album yet.

22:31.566 --> 22:33.766
Erica: Even though you're
unhappy with the new single?

22:33.766 --> 22:35.766
Kai: I thought you said
it was catchy.

22:35.766 --> 22:37.566
I thought you said
it was shit.

22:37.566 --> 22:39.166
Jody: Kai's always
hard on himself.

22:39.166 --> 22:40.566
We all love
the new album.

22:40.566 --> 22:42.200
We're looking
at it as a--

22:42.200 --> 22:43.300
A rebirth.
Right, Kai?

22:43.300 --> 22:44.433
Kai:
Yeah, exactly.

22:44.433 --> 22:46.266
I, uh, finished my time
in rehab,

22:46.266 --> 22:48.666
really turned a corner
with the support of my band,

22:48.666 --> 22:50.000
the label,

22:50.000 --> 22:51.533
and especially all my fans

22:51.533 --> 22:54.533
sending out vibes
of love and positivity.

22:54.533 --> 22:55.733
I'm practically
a new man.

22:55.733 --> 22:57.666
Erica: So, you've conquered
your addiction,

22:57.666 --> 22:59.733
you're excited about
the new album, your band,

22:59.733 --> 23:02.166
and you, you're just one big
happy family.

23:02.166 --> 23:03.166
So everything--

23:03.166 --> 23:04.100
I mean everything
sounds perfect.

23:04.100 --> 23:05.466
Guess I'm just
one lucky guy.

23:05.466 --> 23:07.466
So how are you coping
with the suicide

23:07.466 --> 23:09.633
of your bandmate,
Travis?

23:18.766 --> 23:20.300
Kai:
Bitch.

23:20.300 --> 23:24.333
(Erica clears throat,
Kai's music plays, fans scream)

23:26.000 --> 23:27.000
Okay.

23:28.366 --> 23:32.766
(camera shutters click rapidly,
fans cheer and scream)

23:38.566 --> 23:40.066
What the
hell was that?

23:40.066 --> 23:42.066
I told you,
Travis is off-limits.

23:42.066 --> 23:44.500
And I'm here to understand
who Kai Booker really is.

23:44.500 --> 23:45.700
Not paraphrase
his approved bio.

23:45.700 --> 23:47.500
Yeah, well, good luck
with your story

23:47.500 --> 23:48.633
'cause I'm guessing

23:48.633 --> 23:50.500
that Kai's not gonna say
another word to you

23:50.500 --> 23:52.733
after that little stunt.

23:52.733 --> 23:53.400
Really?

23:53.400 --> 23:55.366
Yeah.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.066
Erica:
Uh, Kai?!

23:57.066 --> 23:59.033
Can we just try
this again?

23:59.033 --> 24:00.033
Please?

24:00.433 --> 24:02.133
Kai:
Hello all you pretty ladies!

24:02.133 --> 24:03.333
(women scream wildly)

24:03.333 --> 24:06.366
Kai: You, you,
and you, gorgeous,

24:06.366 --> 24:07.366
come on over here.

24:07.366 --> 24:08.366
(screaming)

24:08.366 --> 24:09.766
Hey, Jody,
can we squeeze three more

24:09.766 --> 24:11.100
in the penthouse tonight?

24:11.100 --> 24:13.266
Hey, the man knows
what he likes, huh?

24:13.266 --> 24:14.233
(women scream wildly)

24:14.233 --> 24:15.300
Yeah.

24:15.300 --> 24:18.000
(fans scream,
cameras shutters snap)

24:18.000 --> 24:19.066
Noelle.

24:19.066 --> 24:21.266
(fans scream,
camera shutters snap)

24:24.000 --> 24:26.500
Fans:
Wooo! Woooo!

24:31.400 --> 24:32.733
Excuse me.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.200

24:37.366 --> 24:38.566

25:05.766 --> 25:08.166
Kai:
Can't you take a hint?

25:08.166 --> 25:10.600
What're you
still doing here?

25:10.600 --> 25:13.233
So what,
now you're talking to me?

25:13.233 --> 25:14.200
No.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.333
Kai, what do you want
from me?

25:15.333 --> 25:16.733
I'm not part
of your entourage,

25:16.733 --> 25:18.233
I'm not your employee,

25:18.233 --> 25:20.533
I am here to find out
everything I can about you.

25:20.533 --> 25:22.333
You know what?
You crossed the line.

25:22.333 --> 25:24.333
You're trying to make
a name for yourself.

25:24.333 --> 25:26.333
Well, all you did
was piss me off.

25:26.333 --> 25:29.233
You wanna interview me?
You respect my boundaries.

25:30.633 --> 25:32.733
Oh my god,
what happened to you?

25:32.733 --> 25:33.766
Excuse me?

25:33.766 --> 25:35.533
How did you go
from the starving artist

25:35.533 --> 25:37.233
slinging lattes
at goblins,

25:37.233 --> 25:38.366
to this?

25:38.366 --> 25:40.233
I mean, if the Kai
that I knew back then

25:40.233 --> 25:41.300
could see you now?

25:41.300 --> 25:43.166
The Kai you knew
back then?

25:43.166 --> 25:46.233
What the hell are you
talking about?

25:47.233 --> 25:49.266
I used to hang out
at goblins.

25:49.266 --> 25:51.166
Prove it.

25:51.166 --> 25:52.566
Okay, fine.
You, uh--

25:52.566 --> 25:54.266
You worked
with a guy, Dave,

25:54.266 --> 25:55.600
kinda looked like
a leprechaun.

25:55.600 --> 25:58.666
And one night you sang
at a open mic there

25:58.666 --> 26:02.000
and it was
this song about--

26:02.000 --> 26:04.533
It was
about aliens.

26:04.533 --> 26:07.400
"Alien like you."
Jesus, you're not lying.

26:07.400 --> 26:08.533
No, I'm not.

26:08.533 --> 26:11.700
And I remember
how good that song was.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.300
I loved it.

26:18.366 --> 26:19.233
Look, uh--

26:19.233 --> 26:20.600
We got off
on the wrong foot.

26:20.600 --> 26:21.600
I tell you what,

26:21.600 --> 26:23.600
I'll promise not to be
such a diva

26:23.600 --> 26:26.433
if you promise
just not to be--

26:26.433 --> 26:29.166
Such a
hard-ass, deal?

26:29.166 --> 26:30.233
Deal.

26:30.233 --> 26:31.233
All right.

26:32.466 --> 26:34.066
(exhales)

26:34.066 --> 26:35.166
(clears throat)

26:35.166 --> 26:37.300
Kai:
I can still do latte art.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.366
Isn't that crazy?

26:38.366 --> 26:41.133
I can make a leaf,

26:41.133 --> 26:42.500
a heart,

26:42.500 --> 26:44.100
a skull and cross bones.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.233
Really?

26:45.233 --> 26:46.566
It was a no-brain job
and it paid shit,

26:46.566 --> 26:47.766
but I really loved it.

26:47.766 --> 26:48.700
Yeah?

26:48.700 --> 26:50.533
Yeah. that whole
time in my life.

26:50.533 --> 26:55.166
I had a tiny studio apartment
at queen and ossington.

26:55.166 --> 26:57.366
I was nobody;
no one knew me.

26:57.366 --> 26:58.366
It was total freedom.

26:58.366 --> 27:01.366
Just me, my friends,
my music--

27:01.366 --> 27:02.366
Travis.

27:05.233 --> 27:07.433
You know, I think I remember
meeting him once.

27:07.433 --> 27:09.233
He seemed really sweet.

27:09.233 --> 27:11.033
And honestly?
Maybe a little bit dorky.

27:11.033 --> 27:12.166
He was. heh.

27:12.166 --> 27:14.233
I used to give him
a hard time about it.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.466
He was never into looking
the part, you know?

27:16.466 --> 27:18.433
Never into the scene,
you know?

27:18.433 --> 27:20.233
He was
just a great friend.

27:20.233 --> 27:22.100
Hm.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.566
He was
a great songwriter.

27:26.766 --> 27:28.000
Woman:
Kai.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.033
We want you
to come talk to us.

27:30.033 --> 27:30.633
Kai: Yeah?

27:30.633 --> 27:32.100
Woman: The o's pure.

27:32.100 --> 27:33.466
Woman:
come on.

27:33.466 --> 27:34.466
Come on.

27:36.566 --> 27:38.500
Maybe later.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.600
I wanna
show you something.

27:40.600 --> 27:41.600
Erica:
Okay.

27:45.566 --> 27:46.566
(waves rush)

27:47.433 --> 27:49.166
Tell me you don't
recognize this.

27:49.166 --> 27:50.366
Erica:
Is that from goblins?

27:50.366 --> 27:51.633
Is that...

27:51.633 --> 27:54.000
I mean it was at the
far end of the bar, right?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.766
Yeah, 'til my first
album went gold,

27:55.766 --> 27:57.166
and I went in there

27:57.166 --> 27:59.600
and I offered 'em three times
what it was worth.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.033
(shocked laugh)

28:01.033 --> 28:02.666
I mean,
it's a nice coffee maker,

28:02.666 --> 28:04.433
but why?

28:04.433 --> 28:07.400
You won't
write about this?

28:07.400 --> 28:08.533
I promise.

28:10.633 --> 28:12.133
Kai:
Well, Travis and me,

28:12.133 --> 28:15.600
we wrote all our
first songs together.

28:17.566 --> 28:19.733
Every night,
after hours at goblins.

28:19.733 --> 28:21.666
♪ He was a big man ♪

28:21.666 --> 28:23.600
♪ But he still can... ♪

28:23.600 --> 28:24.400
Yeah, yeah.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.666
♪ Fix a broken light ♪

28:26.666 --> 28:28.366
That would help
keep us awake.

28:28.366 --> 28:31.633
Was "Alien like you"
one of those songs?

28:31.633 --> 28:33.500
No, that
was all mine, I--

28:33.500 --> 28:35.300
In fact,
I never finished writing it.

28:35.300 --> 28:36.300
Why not?

28:36.300 --> 28:37.733
'cause it was never
gonna be a hit.

28:37.733 --> 28:41.000
Oh, Kai, I thought
it was incredible.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.133
I mean, you can
still finish it.

28:44.133 --> 28:46.333
Naw, come on, Noelle,
it's not my sound.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.566
It's not what the fans
wanna hear.

28:48.566 --> 28:49.766
Travis once said

28:49.766 --> 28:52.000
it was the most
personal song I ever wrote.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.700
And that's why
I like it.

28:53.700 --> 28:57.000
And I think your fans
will love it.

28:57.433 --> 28:59.633
Jody would say we have
to protect the brand,

28:59.633 --> 29:01.233
that, uh--

29:03.033 --> 29:04.033
Fans want consistency

29:04.033 --> 29:06.233
and that's what head
has to deliver,

29:06.233 --> 29:08.666
that's what sells
the albums.

29:08.666 --> 29:11.733
And is that all
you care about?

29:14.400 --> 29:15.533
(door opens)

29:15.533 --> 29:17.633
Jody:
Kai! Hey.

29:17.633 --> 29:20.033
I, uh, hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

29:20.033 --> 29:20.700
Oh.

29:20.700 --> 29:21.433
What's up?

29:21.433 --> 29:22.500
Shawn just arrived.

29:22.500 --> 29:23.566
He's only in
town tonight, remember?

29:23.566 --> 29:25.433
Ah, can't you
keep him busy, yodel?

29:25.433 --> 29:28.033
Jody: Kai, he flew here
from L.A. To see you.

29:28.033 --> 29:30.033
So, come on, man,
chop-chop.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.066
Don't go anywhere,
okay?

29:33.066 --> 29:35.633
Actually, uh,
come with us.

29:41.300 --> 29:42.533
Shawn:
There's my boy.

29:42.533 --> 29:44.100
(laughing)

29:44.100 --> 29:45.500
Kai:
Hey, shawn.

29:46.500 --> 29:47.500
Who's this?

29:47.500 --> 29:49.366
I'm Erica-
I'm Noelle Erica

29:49.366 --> 29:50.200
with rolling stone.

29:50.200 --> 29:52.066
It's nice to meet you.

29:52.066 --> 29:54.766
So the jury tells me
you were making magic today

29:54.766 --> 29:56.566
in the recording studio.

29:56.566 --> 29:57.566
(chuckles)

29:57.566 --> 30:00.566
I like the song, Kai,
but, uh--

30:00.566 --> 30:03.000
It's not a lead single,
no offense.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.666
No, none taken,
and I agree.

30:04.666 --> 30:06.166
Good.

30:06.166 --> 30:08.500
'Cause I'd like you
to record one more track.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.333
One that I
had written for you.

30:10.333 --> 30:11.466
It's all on here.

30:11.466 --> 30:13.133
We hired the wakenator
and his boys,

30:13.133 --> 30:15.333
uh, put them in a room
for a week,

30:15.333 --> 30:17.733
and what they came up with
was pretty damn great.

30:17.733 --> 30:18.700
Cool.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.233
So, what's
the song called?

30:23.033 --> 30:24.033
"Travis."

30:27.133 --> 30:28.733
You know, Shawn,
I'm sure it's brilliant,

30:28.733 --> 30:30.533
you know, I'm sure.
But, uh, I--

30:30.533 --> 30:33.733
I just don't know if the band is
quite ready for that yet.

30:33.733 --> 30:35.333
Maybe not,
but the fans are.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.333
Erica: And you're not worried
about the backlash?

30:37.333 --> 30:40.666
What if Kai's fans accuse him
of cashing in on a tragedy?

30:40.666 --> 30:41.733
Which it was,

30:41.733 --> 30:43.400
especially for Kai
and for the band.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.033
Shawn: And you're an expert
about this because--

30:46.033 --> 30:47.766
What, you write
for some rag?

30:47.766 --> 30:49.233
Sweetheart,
you're just a groupie

30:49.233 --> 30:51.233
who has a way
with words, that's all.

30:51.233 --> 30:52.766
I really don't feel
comfortable--

30:52.766 --> 30:55.300
Shawn: I really don't like the
way your last album produced.

30:55.300 --> 30:57.300
I really don't like spending
millions of dollars

30:57.300 --> 30:59.033
on yet
another busted flush.

31:04.100 --> 31:05.700
Get back in
the studio tomorrow.

31:05.700 --> 31:09.100
We lead with a single
about Travis.

31:12.366 --> 31:14.633
We'll shut down the internet
with all the downloads.

31:14.633 --> 31:16.033
Whatever it takes,
right, Kai?

31:16.033 --> 31:17.466
You know,
this could be good.

31:17.466 --> 31:20.300
It gives us a chance to tell
the truth about Travis.

31:20.300 --> 31:23.500
You know, and not some
made-up tabloid fantasy.

31:23.500 --> 31:26.333
The more I think about this,
the more I like it.

31:31.433 --> 31:33.033
(alcohol sloshes)

31:36.700 --> 31:38.000
Hey, you
want something?

31:38.000 --> 31:41.066
I can't make a latte,
but, uh scotch.

31:42.066 --> 31:44.633
Tell me you're not gonna
do what they want.

31:44.633 --> 31:47.033
There's a whole shit-pile
riding on this album, Noelle.

31:47.033 --> 31:48.133
So what?

31:48.133 --> 31:49.600
You hate your life
and what you've become.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.033
Excuse me?

31:51.033 --> 31:52.700
Look, you wish that
you could go back in time,

31:52.700 --> 31:54.166
but you don't have to.

31:54.166 --> 31:56.100
This rebirth
that you're looking for,

31:56.100 --> 31:59.033
it can start tonight, Kai.

31:59.033 --> 32:00.033
Don't cave on this.

32:00.033 --> 32:02.066
You stand up to them;
say no.

32:02.066 --> 32:03.066
None of this--

32:03.066 --> 32:05.500
None of it matters
to you anymore.

32:05.500 --> 32:07.333
Just do it, Kai.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.100
Oh, please,
when I got into this biz

32:17.100 --> 32:18.700
they were still releasing
albums on cassette.

32:18.700 --> 32:20.200
You remember cassettes?

32:20.200 --> 32:23.233
I barely
remember CD's, Shawn.

32:23.233 --> 32:24.766
(Jody and Shawn laugh)

32:24.766 --> 32:26.700
I'm not singing
the song.

32:26.700 --> 32:27.733
Jody:
Kai.

32:27.733 --> 32:29.200
Buddy, we already
talked through this.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.633
Kai:
No, you went through it.

32:30.633 --> 32:32.033
And in case you forgot,

32:32.033 --> 32:33.233
you're supposed
to represent me.

32:33.233 --> 32:35.100
Screw the song,
I'm not singing it.

32:35.100 --> 32:36.366
Don't then.

32:36.366 --> 32:39.100
Really.
I'll just get someone else to.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.733
I know Brian
of "The Aunt Selmas"

32:40.733 --> 32:42.133
is a
huge "head" fan.

32:42.133 --> 32:43.533
He would love
to honour Travis.

32:43.533 --> 32:45.166
Kai:
Travis was in our band.

32:45.166 --> 32:47.566
Shawn: Which is why
I want you to sing it.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.566
But you don't have to.

32:49.566 --> 32:52.633
No, we could drop your album
without a hit single.

32:52.633 --> 32:55.600
It would move a few
hundred thousand downloads.

32:55.600 --> 32:58.633
It'd be a nice, small,
personal album.

32:59.633 --> 33:01.500
To wrap up
your career.

33:11.600 --> 33:13.233
Maybe I could
listen to it.

33:13.233 --> 33:14.433
Shawn:
Sure.

33:14.433 --> 33:15.666
Have a listen.

33:15.666 --> 33:17.266
What harm
could it do, right?

33:17.266 --> 33:18.033
Kai.

33:18.033 --> 33:20.000
Hey,
just don't, okay?

33:41.433 --> 33:42.433
(waves roar)

34:00.133 --> 34:02.066
(guitar smashes loudly)

34:06.200 --> 34:06.733
Kai!

34:06.733 --> 34:08.233
No-no-no, don't.

34:14.699 --> 34:16.633
(guitar pieces clatter)

34:24.466 --> 34:26.000
(computer beeps)

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
(touch screen trills)

34:34.000 --> 34:35.166
(screen beeps)

34:36.500 --> 34:40.400
Erica: You know, 2019,
it's not so different from 2009.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.699
Aside from a few little
bells and whistles,

34:42.699 --> 34:44.600
it's pretty much
the same.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.266
Well, you were
expecting robots,

34:46.266 --> 34:47.500
flying cars,

34:47.500 --> 34:50.500
everybody in
silver jumpsuits?

34:53.000 --> 34:54.533
Everything okay?

34:54.533 --> 34:59.133
No. no, I feel like
I'm losing it, actually.

34:59.133 --> 35:02.200
Ah, well, that's not
that surprising, really.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.600
I mean, given that within
the space of two days,

35:04.600 --> 35:07.233
you've become, what?
An administrative assistant,

35:07.233 --> 35:08.333
uh, a messenger,

35:08.333 --> 35:10.600
home organizer,
a sendak,

35:10.600 --> 35:13.633
and now your,
your latest high-wire act -

35:13.633 --> 35:15.766
trying to save
a rock star from--

35:15.766 --> 35:17.400
Well, himself.

35:18.233 --> 35:19.200
That's really unfair.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.200
I mean, you agreed
to send me here.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.466
For perspective.

35:22.466 --> 35:24.033
There's nothing wrong
with trying to help the people

35:24.033 --> 35:25.100
you care about.

35:25.100 --> 35:26.633
No, no, that's true.

35:26.633 --> 35:29.166
But, you know,
there is a--

35:29.166 --> 35:30.166
A line.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.200
"A line."
What-what "line"?

35:32.200 --> 35:33.466
What are you
talking about?

35:33.466 --> 35:35.733
Imagine a parent,

35:35.733 --> 35:37.266
like a mother, say.
Right?

35:37.266 --> 35:38.700
And she spends
her entire life

35:38.700 --> 35:41.333
trying to protect her child
from hardship, you know?

35:41.333 --> 35:43.333
She rushes in to fix
every little problem

35:43.333 --> 35:45.633
and fill in
every little need,

35:45.633 --> 35:48.266
and then the child
grows up

35:49.266 --> 35:51.233
and is left unable
to cope,

35:52.233 --> 35:55.666
you know, with life's
vicissitudes.

35:55.666 --> 35:57.733
And the
parent's defense is,

35:57.733 --> 36:00.133
"well, you know,
we were only trying to help."

36:01.133 --> 36:03.133
But I'm not doing that.

36:04.433 --> 36:05.700
I mean, okay, a little,

36:05.700 --> 36:07.033
but it's only because

36:07.033 --> 36:09.300
I want the people
I care about to be happy.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.633
And I'm sure that
that's true.

36:11.633 --> 36:14.200
But the thing is, Erica,

36:14.200 --> 36:17.400
what if their happiness -
Kai's, your dad's -

36:17.400 --> 36:20.133
is not your responsibility?

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
You help me.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.066
No, not like that.

36:24.066 --> 36:25.433
You do all
the heavy-lifting,

36:25.433 --> 36:27.066
I don't
fix your problems.

36:27.066 --> 36:29.766
You know, I just--
I just point the way.

36:38.133 --> 36:39.533
(exhales shakily)

36:42.500 --> 36:44.133
Ethan:
Erica.

36:44.133 --> 36:45.533
Barbara: Sweetheart,
are you all right?

36:45.533 --> 36:48.166
Erica: Uh, yes,
I feel much, much better.

36:48.166 --> 36:51.366
Just a little splash of water
on my face is all I needed.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.400
Barbara:
Honey,

36:53.400 --> 36:54.633
maybe you should
lie down.

36:54.633 --> 36:56.666
Let her decide
what she wants to do.

36:56.666 --> 36:59.700
Come on, number one,
your captain needs you.

36:59.700 --> 37:02.400
Actually, I don't think
that I should.

37:02.400 --> 37:04.300
I mean,
in case I faint again.

37:04.300 --> 37:05.700
If that's
okay with you, Steph?

37:05.700 --> 37:07.700
Stephanie: Of course.
My mom will do it.

37:07.700 --> 37:11.633
Just go.
Just take it easy.

37:11.633 --> 37:14.066
Okay, everybody,
can I please have quiet?

37:14.066 --> 37:17.066
We're going
to try this again.

37:20.433 --> 37:21.766
As I was saying,

37:22.500 --> 37:25.466
the ritual of the brit milah
marks baby jonah's entry

37:25.466 --> 37:27.400
into the
jewish community.

37:27.400 --> 37:28.400
Roberta?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.200
(exhales shakily)

37:38.366 --> 37:39.366
I'm sorry.

37:40.700 --> 37:43.033
Excuse me.

37:43.033 --> 37:44.033
I'll keep her company.

37:54.166 --> 37:55.100
(muted shushing)

37:55.100 --> 37:56.100
(baby cries)

38:05.133 --> 38:06.133
(sighs)

38:07.366 --> 38:08.366
(baby wails)

38:10.266 --> 38:13.100
(speaking in hebrew)

38:25.533 --> 38:27.366
(exhales deeply)

38:31.233 --> 38:32.500
Dad, can we talk?

38:33.500 --> 38:34.500
Mm-hm.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.233
What's going on,
Erica?

38:41.266 --> 38:43.600
Because it feels to me
like it's about more

38:43.600 --> 38:45.200
than just a little
squeamishness.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.200
It is.

38:47.433 --> 38:48.433
Um--

38:49.733 --> 38:52.233
I never should've agreed
to be the sendak.

38:52.233 --> 38:54.266
What? Why?

38:54.266 --> 38:55.766
Because I--

38:57.233 --> 39:00.200
I did it to
make you happy.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.033
I just--
I wanted to do something

39:02.033 --> 39:04.100
that would take your mind
off of Norm,

39:04.100 --> 39:07.100
and--

39:09.266 --> 39:12.300
Well, the truth is,
is that--

39:12.300 --> 39:14.566
I feel very conflicted

39:16.433 --> 39:19.166
about the whole thing.

39:19.166 --> 39:23.266
Just the idea of
circumcising a baby--

39:24.266 --> 39:25.733
It-it's awful.

39:25.733 --> 39:27.266
What're you talking about?!

39:27.266 --> 39:28.700
It's the sign
of the covenant.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.666
I know, but--
I mean you're cutting a baby -

39:31.666 --> 39:34.400
without anesthetic -
for no reason!

39:34.400 --> 39:37.166
And I'm sorry, dad,
but I just don't get it

39:37.166 --> 39:40.233
and I never should have
agreed to participate.

39:40.233 --> 39:42.233
Then why did you?

39:42.233 --> 39:43.433
Because I--

39:43.433 --> 39:44.633
I wanted to do something

39:44.633 --> 39:47.000
that would make you feel
like we're connected.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.333
So this is your token
gesture?

39:49.333 --> 39:50.733
You spent years
neglecting your religion.

39:50.733 --> 39:52.733
No, dad, that's not
what this is about.

39:52.733 --> 39:54.000
I'm a rabbi, Erica,

39:54.000 --> 39:55.466
and my family has rejected

39:55.466 --> 39:57.100
everything that
matters to me.

39:57.100 --> 39:58.400
Sam married an anglican,

39:58.400 --> 39:59.766
your mom's dating
Harrison Ford.

39:59.766 --> 40:01.200
And I'm with Ethan.
I'm--

40:01.200 --> 40:03.200
Dad, what do you
want me to do?

40:03.200 --> 40:05.000
Do you want me
to dump Ethan

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
and go find
a nice jewish guy?

40:11.666 --> 40:14.266
You're--
I mean you're unhappy

40:14.266 --> 40:15.500
and you're lonely,

40:15.500 --> 40:18.100
and I would love to be able
to help you with that,

40:18.100 --> 40:20.633
but the truth is, I--

40:20.633 --> 40:22.633
Is even if I became
a super jew

40:22.633 --> 40:25.700
and watched marathon sessions
of star trek with you,

40:25.700 --> 40:29.166
it's--
I can't fix what's wrong.

40:32.433 --> 40:35.666
That has to start
with you, dad.

40:47.700 --> 40:49.766
(contemporary jazz music plays)

40:55.700 --> 40:57.700
(dishes clatter lightly)

41:00.433 --> 41:01.766
hi.

41:01.766 --> 41:03.466
Wow,
you look exhausted.

41:03.466 --> 41:05.533
Oh, well, thank you.

41:05.533 --> 41:07.033
It's been a rough day.

41:07.033 --> 41:08.000
(tight inhale)

41:08.000 --> 41:10.100
Can I get a mint tea?

41:10.100 --> 41:12.266
Yeah.
A mint tea, please?

41:12.266 --> 41:13.466
I'm sorry
about this morning,

41:13.466 --> 41:14.533
I just went off.

41:14.533 --> 41:16.066
Hey, that's okay,
I've been there.

41:16.066 --> 41:17.466
Really?
It doesn't seem like it.

41:17.466 --> 41:18.533
I don't know,

41:18.533 --> 41:20.300
maybe you're just used
to having some guy

41:20.300 --> 41:23.500
who calls himself a doctor -
doesn't even have a last name -

41:23.500 --> 41:26.600
sticking his nose in
where it doesn't belong.

41:26.600 --> 41:29.500
You know, my doctor?
He helps me, Kai.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.233
So is that why
you're here?

41:31.233 --> 41:33.300
To convince me
I've got it all wrong?

41:33.300 --> 41:35.433
No, no, I'm just...

41:37.666 --> 41:40.133
I'm just your friend,
someone you can talk to.

41:40.133 --> 41:43.300
Someone who understands
how crazy therapy is.

41:45.100 --> 41:46.200
Thank you.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.633
Well, I don't wanna talk
about my therapy,

41:47.633 --> 41:49.266
you know that.

41:57.100 --> 41:59.600
You know, you met
your doctor for a reason.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.200
No one forced you
into therapy.

42:02.200 --> 42:05.466
You agreed to it
just like I did.

42:08.100 --> 42:10.433
Thank you for the tea.

42:20.566 --> 42:22.133
(laughing)

42:23.133 --> 42:24.666
(knocking at the door)

42:25.666 --> 42:27.133
Who could that be?

42:27.133 --> 42:28.633
I don't know.
It's late.

42:28.633 --> 42:30.766
Tv entertainment anchor: just
one or two horror stories here,

42:30.766 --> 42:32.166
we're talking about hundreds.

42:32.166 --> 42:33.766
And the more you read
these stories,

42:33.766 --> 42:36.166
the more you realize--

42:39.700 --> 42:41.266
Dad.

42:41.266 --> 42:43.100
It's a clear night.

42:43.100 --> 42:45.100
I was in the neighbourhood
and I thought--

42:45.100 --> 42:46.233
If you weren't busy,

42:46.233 --> 42:49.266
maybe we could put
this old thing to use?

42:50.266 --> 42:53.266
Maybe search for life
on Mars?

42:54.633 --> 42:56.266
Erica: Ethan,
do you wanna come?

42:56.266 --> 42:57.733
You know what?
I'm good.

42:57.733 --> 42:58.733
Thanks.
