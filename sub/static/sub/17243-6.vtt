00:00.399 --> 00:02.477
Hey, Moira, could you
turn that down please?

00:02.477 --> 00:04.646
Important call coming through.

00:04.647 --> 00:07.115
Stevie says it's the guy from the winery.

00:07.116 --> 00:10.051
Hmm.

00:13.656 --> 00:15.056
Hello, Johnny Rose.

00:15.057 --> 00:18.927
Hello? Hello?

00:18.928 --> 00:21.029
Ah.

00:21.030 --> 00:23.665
Stevie?

00:23.666 --> 00:25.467
- I put it through!
- Okay.

00:25.468 --> 00:27.836
- Who is it?
- Herb Ertlinger.

00:27.837 --> 00:30.105
- Excuse me?
- Herb Ertlinger from the winery.

00:30.106 --> 00:32.274
He's the only guy that's gotten
back to me on my proposal.

00:32.275 --> 00:33.446
And-and now the ph-

00:34.944 --> 00:37.178
Hi! Hello!

00:40.817 --> 00:43.251
There's something wrong with the phones!

00:43.252 --> 00:46.221
John, have her patch it
through to the kids' room.

00:46.222 --> 00:48.557
Yeah, patch it through to the kids' room!

00:48.558 --> 00:49.958
Okay!

00:52.195 --> 00:54.830
Very good suggestion!

00:54.831 --> 00:56.998
Kids!

00:56.999 --> 00:59.768
David, answer the phone!

00:59.769 --> 01:01.837
He has his headphones in; He can't hear it.

01:01.838 --> 01:04.372
- Then you answer it!
- Okay!

01:04.373 --> 01:08.009
Hello?

01:08.010 --> 01:09.978
Alexis, could you open the door, please?

01:09.979 --> 01:11.179
I'll take it.

01:11.180 --> 01:11.913
No, sorry, you have the wrong room.

01:11.914 --> 01:13.882
He's actually in room 6.

01:13.883 --> 01:15.917
Alexis, unlock the door please!

01:15.918 --> 01:20.355
Okay! No problem. Bye.

01:20.356 --> 01:22.090
He's gonna call you back in your room!

01:22.091 --> 01:26.661
No!

01:26.662 --> 01:29.831
Hello?

01:34.966 --> 01:38.975

01:40.577 --> 01:42.611
Can you get a heart murmur
from a lack of sleep?

01:42.612 --> 01:44.346
Because I have not slept
since we've got here

01:44.347 --> 01:45.893
and I think my body is shutting down.

01:45.894 --> 01:48.817
Well, I hate to admit it, but I actually
know very little about heart murmurs.

01:48.818 --> 01:50.285
Well, I have one.

01:50.286 --> 01:52.621
Uh, the pulse is very irregular.

01:52.622 --> 01:54.489
Honestly, David, I have
tried to find my pulse

01:54.490 --> 01:56.558
like a thousand times and
nothing. So don't worry about it.

01:56.559 --> 01:57.659
No, this is very serious!

01:57.660 --> 01:59.060
My heart has not rested in a long time,

01:59.061 --> 02:01.029
my immune system is very low,

02:01.030 --> 02:03.465
I have not been able to
find kale anywhere here-

02:03.466 --> 02:05.533
how long are we going to
be talking about you for?

02:05.534 --> 02:07.335
I think I'm having a heart
attack, is what's happening!

02:07.336 --> 02:08.570
David, you are like 34.

02:08.571 --> 02:10.437
I'm basically 29.

02:10.439 --> 02:12.207
Oh my God, you are overreacting.

02:12.208 --> 02:13.608
I think you're gonna feel very guilty

02:13.609 --> 02:15.477
when I slip into a coma and
you have to come visit me

02:15.478 --> 02:17.812
in the hospital at hospice.

02:17.813 --> 02:19.948
Well, I'm gonna go for a jog,
so don't die until I get back.

02:19.949 --> 02:22.350
Well, how long are you going for?

02:22.351 --> 02:23.952
Um, I don't really know. How long
are you gonna be like this for?

02:23.953 --> 02:25.720
- Don't be a little b...
- Bye!

02:25.721 --> 02:27.655
When I'm this state!

02:34.163 --> 02:37.132
Now, it's fruit wine,
which is exciting in itself.

02:37.133 --> 02:39.000
But the thing we're most proud of

02:39.001 --> 02:42.237
is that our fruit is 100% insecticide free.

02:42.238 --> 02:43.772
- Ah!
- Mm!

02:43.773 --> 02:45.206
Mm! Mm.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.609
There's something in mine.

02:47.610 --> 02:49.147
Oh, that's a ladybug.
That's one of the good ones.

02:49.148 --> 02:51.579
Excuse me.

02:51.580 --> 02:54.316
Herb Ertlinger...

02:54.317 --> 02:56.685
No, this tastes like something
one should not put in their mouth.

02:56.686 --> 02:59.120
It's fruit wine. Whoever
heard of fruit wine?

02:59.121 --> 03:01.423
Doesn't matter, it's a
business. I'll make it work.

03:01.424 --> 03:03.024
It's next to a landfill, John.

03:03.025 --> 03:05.493
He said former landfill.

03:05.494 --> 03:08.163
Sorry. I was looking into a new sprayer.

03:08.164 --> 03:10.265
And I brought you this...

03:10.266 --> 03:12.534
It's our Cabernet Merlot petit grenache.

03:12.535 --> 03:13.969
Oh!

03:13.970 --> 03:16.938
Sounds delightfully busy.

03:16.939 --> 03:19.407
You know, uh, Herb, if you
need any help with distribution,

03:19.408 --> 03:21.876
I have extensive contacts in that area,

03:21.877 --> 03:24.946
or if it's operations management...

03:24.947 --> 03:26.514
Johnny, while I appreciate that offer,

03:26.515 --> 03:29.084
it's actually not your
help I'm looking for.

03:29.085 --> 03:31.453
- Oh.
- No. It's you, Moira.

03:31.454 --> 03:34.589
We were hoping that you
will be the spokesperson

03:34.590 --> 03:37.325
for Herb Ertlinger fruit wines.

03:37.326 --> 03:39.494
I-I don't understand.

03:39.495 --> 03:42.330
My wife and I were such
big fans of "Sunrise Bay."

03:42.331 --> 03:44.632
And we would be an honoured to have you

03:44.633 --> 03:46.935
do just a few commercials
to promote our wine.

03:46.936 --> 03:49.471
That is, of course, if you like it.

03:49.472 --> 03:52.807
Like it? It's fruit
wine. What's not to like?

03:59.315 --> 04:02.050
So, an hour ago, I thought
I was having a heart attack.

04:02.051 --> 04:03.885
- Oh no!
- Yup, yup. Yup.

04:03.886 --> 04:06.021
- Um, but I'm not.
- Oh, phew!

04:06.022 --> 04:09.524
According to Web MD, I'm
having a pulmonary embolism,

04:09.525 --> 04:11.826
which is much, much worse.

04:11.827 --> 04:13.361
Well, you look good.

04:13.362 --> 04:15.163
That's... just the way I look.

04:15.164 --> 04:17.798
I need you to take me
to a hospital right now.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.000
Yeah, the only hospital's in Elmdale.

04:20.002 --> 04:21.736
You're telling me there's
no doctor around here?

04:21.737 --> 04:24.572
People just drop dead in the
streets out of sheer neglect?

04:24.573 --> 04:27.442
Well, there is, technically, a doctor.

04:27.443 --> 04:30.011
Then, please take me to
that doctor right now.

04:31.514 --> 04:33.181
I'm just not sleeping.

04:33.182 --> 04:34.949
I think there's a lack of
oxygen getting to my heart

04:34.950 --> 04:36.618
because I'm feeling very suffocated.

04:36.619 --> 04:38.753
Okay, right. Well, if it is a heart attack

04:38.754 --> 04:40.388
we're way too far away
from the nearest hospital

04:40.389 --> 04:41.831
for you to make it through the night.

04:41.832 --> 04:42.891
- What?
- Kidding.

04:42.892 --> 04:44.659
Take a deep breath for me.

04:44.660 --> 04:46.728
Good.

04:46.729 --> 04:48.969
Now, have you been around any
feces in the past two days?

04:50.232 --> 04:52.700
- I don't n...
- So, no.

04:52.701 --> 04:54.836
- No.
- Okay. Well, the good thing is,

04:54.837 --> 04:56.738
I don't think that you
need an ambulance, David,

04:56.739 --> 04:58.606
because what I think is happening here

04:58.607 --> 05:00.875
is you're having a panic attack.

05:00.876 --> 05:02.577
Oh no, those... Those aren't real.

05:02.578 --> 05:04.579
Those are a PR spin for
celebrity publicists.

05:04.580 --> 05:07.949
Trust me, I've known enough celebrities.

05:07.950 --> 05:10.652
No, it's absolutely a... A real thing.

05:10.653 --> 05:12.420
Uh, tell me, have you
had any experiences lately

05:12.421 --> 05:15.990
that have caused you... Stress or anxiety?

05:15.991 --> 05:18.860
Uh, well, I went from living
in a 25 hundred square foot

05:18.861 --> 05:20.562
Soho live/workspace

05:20.563 --> 05:23.031
to a motel room with my sister.

05:23.032 --> 05:26.334
Wow. Eek. That'll do it.

05:26.335 --> 05:28.569
"Hello, I'm Moira Rose for Herb-"

05:31.707 --> 05:35.743
"Oh, hi! I'm Moira Rose
for Herb Ertlinger wines

05:35.744 --> 05:38.446
inviting you to try our latest offering,

05:38.447 --> 05:41.916
a fruity cab franc we call...

05:41.917 --> 05:44.319
We call Herb Ertlinger's fruity cab-"

05:44.320 --> 05:47.340
Oh, no. No, no, no. No good.

05:47.990 --> 05:51.392
Uh...

05:51.393 --> 05:55.029
"Smokey tannins infuse this rich
blend with a plummy bouquet."

05:55.030 --> 05:58.233
"Plummy bouquet"? Is this guy for real?

05:58.234 --> 06:00.269
His turns of phrase
leave much to be desired,

06:00.270 --> 06:02.237
but the wine is potable.

06:02.238 --> 06:04.205
You called it liquid stink this morning.

06:04.206 --> 06:06.141
The whites seem less stinky.

06:06.142 --> 06:08.877
How about this tote bag?

06:08.878 --> 06:11.079
Two-ply toilet paper has more heft.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.748
I'm sensing negativity, John.

06:13.749 --> 06:17.218
Is this because he did not
take you up on your offer?

06:17.219 --> 06:20.722
Are you kidding me? Come on!

06:20.723 --> 06:23.458
Hey, I haven't even given that guy
a second's thought since I got home.

06:23.459 --> 06:25.793
I was doing him a favour, that's all.

06:25.794 --> 06:27.662
I don't want him
tarnishing your reputation.

06:27.663 --> 06:29.412
I mean, have you read the literature?

06:29.413 --> 06:31.399
Look at this.

06:31.400 --> 06:34.502
"The maximum benefit of
the peachafication process."

06:34.503 --> 06:37.238
"Peachafication!" Who uses
a word like "peachafication"?

06:37.239 --> 06:40.074
A moron... would use that.

06:40.075 --> 06:43.678
That moron is the first moron to offer
me an acting role in a very long time.

06:43.679 --> 06:45.480
Well, he's lucky to have you.

06:45.481 --> 06:50.185
John, this commercial, in
the right hands, could be...

06:50.186 --> 06:51.619
I don't want to use the word "comeback,"

06:51.620 --> 06:54.689
that's... I don't wanna jinx it, but...

06:54.690 --> 06:57.458
John, no one knows the
business better than you do.

06:57.459 --> 07:00.628
Oh, honey, I'm just the
money behind the scenes.

07:00.629 --> 07:03.464
Not that I don't have a few company
commercials under my belt, but...

07:03.465 --> 07:06.000
If you want me in your corner, I'm there.

07:06.001 --> 07:09.437
Oh, John. Thank you.

07:09.438 --> 07:11.239
- I'll do what I can.
- Thank you.

07:11.240 --> 07:14.709
But seriously, how cheap ass is that bag?

07:14.710 --> 07:16.377
Ew, ew-ew, ew, ew!

07:16.378 --> 07:18.218
You have to open your
eyes to get it in the bag!

07:18.219 --> 07:20.481
Ugh! Good. Ugh!

07:20.482 --> 07:24.052
So can I ask you a question?

07:24.053 --> 07:25.653
Why do you always get
dressed up to do this?

07:25.654 --> 07:28.223
I mean, it doesn't seem very practical.

07:28.224 --> 07:31.092
Naomi Campbell wore Dolce & Gabbana couture

07:31.093 --> 07:33.194
to her community service.

07:33.195 --> 07:34.762
And just because she
was picking up roadkill

07:34.763 --> 07:36.664
did not mean that she
needed to look like it.

07:36.665 --> 07:40.101
And I just always really
admired her courage.

07:42.271 --> 07:45.873
Um... I didn't understand
a word you just said.

07:45.874 --> 07:49.244
Besides, it's nice to uh... Change
clothes every once in a while.

07:49.245 --> 07:52.981
Something you might wanna
consider doing at some point.

07:52.982 --> 07:54.782
I change my clothes.

07:54.783 --> 07:56.384
They're just all the same.

07:56.385 --> 07:59.821
Uh-huh. Yeah.

07:59.822 --> 08:02.190
Oh! Well, at least now they'll get washed.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.691
Agghhhh!

08:03.692 --> 08:06.227
Come on! Run!

08:08.000 --> 08:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:17.740 --> 08:21.109
What? It's actually nice in here.

08:21.110 --> 08:22.810
Well, I'm not Valentino, but you know.

08:22.811 --> 08:25.680
Okay, well, don't try
and be funny about it.

08:25.681 --> 08:27.882
It just happens naturally.

08:30.486 --> 08:32.854
It's that um...

08:32.855 --> 08:34.956
When a guy can pack his whole wardrobe

08:34.957 --> 08:36.491
into an overnight bag,

08:36.491 --> 08:40.061
you just don't really think that
he'd be much of an interior designer.

08:44.066 --> 08:45.933
Don't worry, they're fresh. They're clean.

08:45.934 --> 08:50.396
Hmm. Ooh! Smell that
rock-beaten freshness.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.808
What?

08:53.809 --> 08:56.210
It's just I do beat my
laundry against rocks.

08:56.211 --> 08:58.346
You're a freak.

09:16.717 --> 09:20.921
What uh... what kind of
lens are we using here?

09:20.922 --> 09:23.256
It's uh... It's a zoom lens.

09:23.257 --> 09:24.591
Oh, zoom! Good, good, good.

09:24.592 --> 09:26.159
- Yup, yeah.
- Any primes?

09:26.160 --> 09:28.461
Any primes? Using any primes?

09:28.462 --> 09:30.830
Nah. Those are usually for feature films.

09:30.831 --> 09:34.935
Yeah. Yeah. No, it's just I...

09:34.936 --> 09:37.003
What's the, uh, ring light situation?

09:37.004 --> 09:38.772
Do you think we need an inkey?

09:38.773 --> 09:39.973
Uh... I don't know, I don't know...

09:39.974 --> 09:45.006
I... are we booming this... Today?

09:54.655 --> 09:56.856
- Ew!
- Shhh!

09:56.857 --> 09:58.858
Why is it dark?

09:58.859 --> 10:00.560
It's like a witch's house in here, David.

10:00.561 --> 10:02.128
- Shush!
- What's going on?

10:02.129 --> 10:04.097
I am on day two of a panic attack

10:04.098 --> 10:06.666
and I have not slept at all.

10:06.667 --> 10:10.637
Babe, you know that panic
attacks aren't real, right?

10:10.638 --> 10:12.839
They're just things that
celebrities make up to...

10:12.840 --> 10:15.048
No, I know. I thought
so too, but they are real

10:15.049 --> 10:16.648
and I'm having one apparently.

10:16.649 --> 10:18.511
Okay. Okay.

10:18.512 --> 10:20.513
Well, while you were
having your panic attack,

10:20.514 --> 10:25.485
I somehow agreed to attend a yoga class.

10:25.486 --> 10:27.087
That might be a good thing for me.

10:27.088 --> 10:28.688
Okay, well, I'm not gonna go though.

10:28.689 --> 10:30.557
That might help me relax,
might help me calm down.

10:30.558 --> 10:32.492
David, I just said I'm not gonna go.

10:32.493 --> 10:35.028
I don't wanna have to bring this up...

10:35.029 --> 10:38.531
But it's my turn to take a selfish.

10:38.532 --> 10:39.954
- No, David,
- Yes, it is.

10:39.955 --> 10:42.936
- You selfished last time.
- No. Dubai, 2010,

10:42.937 --> 10:45.399
I had to pick you up from that blind date

10:45.400 --> 10:47.200
that went terribly wrong.

10:47.201 --> 10:51.237
It was a total disaster. It's my turn,

10:51.238 --> 10:53.206
and I wanna go to a yoga class.

10:53.207 --> 10:55.541
Fine, I will go,

10:55.542 --> 10:57.276
but I am not happy about this at all.

10:57.277 --> 10:59.178
Okay. Get off my bed.

10:59.179 --> 11:02.148
Ouch, David. Ouch, David!

11:02.149 --> 11:04.617
- Ugh!
- Shut the curtains!

11:06.987 --> 11:08.755
Oh, some people like to exaggerate,

11:08.756 --> 11:10.925
especially in our business.

11:10.926 --> 11:13.158
I dunno. A lot of people
on set were saying it.

11:13.159 --> 11:14.694
He's making people nervous.

11:14.695 --> 11:17.830
I don't care what other's
say. That's today's mantra.

11:19.933 --> 11:22.168
- You look awesome!
- Oh...

11:22.169 --> 11:24.570
- Hey! There she is!
- Hi!

11:24.571 --> 11:27.140
There's my TV star. Hi, sweetheart.

11:27.141 --> 11:28.808
- Hi!
- Nervous?

11:28.809 --> 11:31.277
- No, I'm good.
- Good! Don't want you nervous!

11:31.278 --> 11:33.780
- No.
- Is that the outfit you're wearing?

11:33.781 --> 11:36.215
Yes. That's the one you
and I chose together.

11:36.216 --> 11:38.488
Oh. It looks a little less
flattering in the daylight.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.212
Johnny!

11:39.213 --> 11:41.320
No. I'm just saying, if
there's another outfit-

11:41.321 --> 11:43.356
- No! There's no second choice.
- Really?

11:43.357 --> 11:45.091
- No.
- Oh, I don't know.

11:45.092 --> 11:46.359
- Cheese tray.
- Whoa, whoa, cubby,

11:46.360 --> 11:48.428
what's this? Who ordered cheese?

11:48.429 --> 11:50.329
- I... I asked for cheese.
- Oh no, no. No cheese.

11:50.330 --> 11:51.531
I don't think that's a good idea.

11:51.532 --> 11:53.066
- What about the melon?
- You ordered melon?

11:53.067 --> 11:54.133
- No, I didn't.
- No, well, let's see...

11:54.134 --> 11:55.568
You know what? Looks a little soft.

11:55.569 --> 11:58.571
Why don't we eighty-six that plate.

11:58.572 --> 12:00.106
- Johnny? Johnny?
- Yeah?

12:00.107 --> 12:02.642
- Crystal, do you mind?
- Yeah. Hey, crystal.

12:02.643 --> 12:04.644
- Speak to my husband.
- Hey.

12:04.645 --> 12:07.113
Yeah... listen. The script,
I wanna make a few line-

12:07.114 --> 12:09.382
No! John, no more changes.

12:09.383 --> 12:12.452
I was wondering if it
might be better if you-

12:12.453 --> 12:14.387
Just directed. Just directed?

12:14.388 --> 12:15.788
Believe me, I tried. That didn't fly.

12:15.789 --> 12:17.623
No. Went home.

12:19.927 --> 12:22.795
- Went home?
- Mm-hmm.

12:22.796 --> 12:24.731
- Why?
- Because you're making me nervous.

12:24.732 --> 12:26.532
And apparently you're
making everyone nervous.

12:26.533 --> 12:28.468
No, no, no. Honey, I'm just trying to help.

12:28.469 --> 12:30.303
I'm just trying to be...
You know, watching your back.

12:30.304 --> 12:32.538
I know, John. You're so good at trying.

12:32.539 --> 12:34.273
Now, I'm gonna call
you as soon as I'm done.

12:34.274 --> 12:37.643
- Crystal?
- Yeah?

12:37.644 --> 12:39.979
Yeah, sure. Well, I can just uh...

12:39.980 --> 12:41.114
Yeah, I'll just uh... go home.

12:41.115 --> 12:44.250
Bye.

12:44.251 --> 12:47.687
- All right.
- Bye.

12:47.688 --> 12:50.289
All right. Have a good shoot!

12:51.792 --> 12:54.694
- You look good.
- No, keep working please.

13:04.271 --> 13:06.139
- Oh!
- Okay, I don't think I can do this.

13:06.140 --> 13:07.373
There's a lot of people here.

13:07.374 --> 13:10.143
Hey! You guys made it! Amazing!

13:10.144 --> 13:12.311
It's a pairs class, so partner up.

13:15.616 --> 13:16.516
Okay, well, I'm not touching you.

13:16.517 --> 13:18.351
Well, I'm not touching you.

13:18.352 --> 13:20.253
- David, Hun.
- Oh!

13:20.254 --> 13:23.222
- Come join me.
- Oh... Jocelyn.

13:23.223 --> 13:24.457
Normally I do this with Roland,

13:24.458 --> 13:27.326
but he had a bad burrito so he's M.I.A.

13:27.327 --> 13:29.195
- Oh...
- Trust me, that's good news for everybody.

13:29.196 --> 13:30.930
I'm sure it is.

13:30.931 --> 13:33.933
And Alexis, you can join Mutt.

13:33.934 --> 13:37.203
Okay.

13:37.204 --> 13:39.505
This is gonna be good for you. Just relax.

13:39.506 --> 13:41.641
- Oh, okay. All right.
- Okay.

13:41.642 --> 13:44.143
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:49.149 --> 13:51.784
Ted told me all about your...

13:51.785 --> 13:53.352
Nervous breakdown.

13:55.055 --> 13:57.156
My... my what?

13:57.157 --> 13:59.759
I was at the cafe. He
didn't mention any names,

13:59.760 --> 14:03.095
but when he said it was
someone "precious," I knew.

14:05.199 --> 14:06.933
- Slating!
- ...Somehow.

14:06.934 --> 14:08.601
Remember to smile.

14:08.602 --> 14:10.770
- All right, get out of there, ladies!
- Thank you.

14:10.771 --> 14:12.905
And action!

14:12.906 --> 14:15.775
Hello, I'm Moira Rose.

14:15.776 --> 14:19.478
And if you like fruit wine as much as I do,

14:19.479 --> 14:24.650
discover a winery that pours care
and craftsmanship into every glace.

14:24.651 --> 14:27.053
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:27.054 --> 14:30.423
I wanted to say glass,
but I... was thinking case.

14:30.424 --> 14:31.858
That was great. Loved it.

14:31.859 --> 14:34.160
Uh, same energy. Back
to one. Still rolling.

14:34.161 --> 14:35.862
Check your teeth. Yeah.

14:35.863 --> 14:37.430
Outta there, ladies.

14:37.431 --> 14:39.999
Still rolling... And when you're ready-

14:40.000 --> 14:41.534
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

14:41.535 --> 14:43.102
Action.

14:43.103 --> 14:45.538
Hello, I'm Moira Rose,

14:45.539 --> 14:47.840
and if you enjoy flute line as much as-

14:47.841 --> 14:51.010
What?

14:51.011 --> 14:52.511
Uh... you said "flute line."

14:52.512 --> 14:55.081
Oh. Oh, that is funny.

14:55.082 --> 14:58.017
No problem. Uh... back to ones.

14:58.018 --> 15:00.286
And when you're ready... Action!

15:00.287 --> 15:02.755
Hello, I'm moina rose, and if you Li-

15:02.756 --> 15:04.056
Okay, back to ones. Still rolling.

15:04.057 --> 15:06.058
- Why? Why?
- You said "moina."

15:06.059 --> 15:07.426
- You sure did.
- Are you sure?

15:07.427 --> 15:09.228
- Yeah. Yeah, it's cool.
- I'm good.

15:09.229 --> 15:10.429
- That's great. All right.
- Please, I'm good.

15:10.430 --> 15:11.564
- Get outta there, ladies.
- Please, yes.

15:11.565 --> 15:14.300
And... when you're ready, action!

15:19.306 --> 15:21.474
Action.

15:24.111 --> 15:25.911
Action?

15:35.389 --> 15:36.553
Well, thanks for the lift, Thomas.

15:36.554 --> 15:38.067
You got it, Mr. Rose.

15:38.068 --> 15:40.110
Yeah, we're talking to her now.

15:40.111 --> 15:42.028
Where'd she go?

15:42.029 --> 15:45.431
Apparently she just locked
herself in the bathroom.

15:45.432 --> 15:47.900
He's gonna pull the plug on the
whole thing unless, and I quote,

15:47.901 --> 15:50.670
"that Bitch gets her
Ass out of the trailer."

15:50.671 --> 15:52.238
Maybe I should get back in the car?

15:52.239 --> 15:53.906
I'm guessing, yes.

16:02.115 --> 16:05.618
Rolling the shoulders
back and down, lengthen...

16:05.619 --> 16:07.420
It's just all these feelings
of displacement, you know?

16:07.421 --> 16:08.587
- Like I've...
- Yeah...

16:08.588 --> 16:10.356
I think I'm just having a very hard time

16:10.357 --> 16:13.592
adjusting to the overall
aesthetic of the town.

16:13.593 --> 16:15.161
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Um...

16:15.162 --> 16:16.829
And it's just running through
my head and I've been...

16:16.830 --> 16:19.398
Yeah, lots of talking. Lots of emoting.

16:19.399 --> 16:22.902
That's good, David. Yeah.
Um, have you tried sex?

16:22.903 --> 16:25.471
- Excuse me?
- Sex puts me right to sleep.

16:25.472 --> 16:29.108
- You should have lots and lots of sex.
- Ugh...

16:29.109 --> 16:30.576
Now, with your partner's help,

16:30.577 --> 16:33.579
send your hips to the back of the barn

16:33.580 --> 16:37.950
and partners roll your biceps out and up,

16:37.951 --> 16:40.619
guiding the hips wide and back.

16:40.620 --> 16:42.722
- Is everyone doing this?
- Mm-hmm.

16:42.723 --> 16:44.790
- Um, how's your back?
- It's good.

16:44.791 --> 16:46.792
I mean, normally, it's
a little tight, but...

16:46.793 --> 16:49.061
Yeah, it is. I mean I-I haven't noticed.

16:49.062 --> 16:51.397
I have noticed, I haven't-

16:51.398 --> 16:53.599
I haven't "noticed" noticed, so...

16:53.600 --> 16:56.068
- How're we doing here?
- Good. Super good.

16:56.069 --> 16:59.572
Um... this is a very challenging...

16:59.573 --> 17:01.674
Yoga class, Twyla. Thank you.

17:01.675 --> 17:03.743
Thanks! Yeah, so just
hold Mutt's lower back here

17:03.744 --> 17:05.077
just to support him.

17:05.078 --> 17:06.579
- Okay.
- Good.

17:06.579 --> 17:08.848
Now feel the inner edge of the thigh...

17:08.848 --> 17:11.117
Mm-hmm.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.098
Let's bring it down... Oh, no!

17:13.099 --> 17:15.154
Oh!

17:15.155 --> 17:16.541
Mutt should support his own thigh.

17:16.542 --> 17:18.557
Omigod! Omigod! I'm so sorry.

17:18.558 --> 17:20.393
I'm sssso sorry.

17:20.394 --> 17:22.528
It's okay. Yeah.

17:22.529 --> 17:24.230
Wow, I'm so sorry.

17:32.906 --> 17:35.107
Moira? It's me.

17:35.108 --> 17:36.275
Hi!

17:36.276 --> 17:38.444
You okay?

17:38.445 --> 17:42.114
Yeah... I blew it,
Johnny. I blew it big time.

17:42.115 --> 17:43.949
Let me in, sweetheart.

17:43.950 --> 17:46.652
Oh, I don't know how.

17:46.653 --> 17:49.088
There's a knob on the door.

17:49.089 --> 17:53.592
No, I mean I don't know
how to do this anymore!

17:53.593 --> 17:55.828
I'm no good!

18:04.004 --> 18:05.037
How did you open the door?

18:05.038 --> 18:07.907
I threw a shoe.

18:11.011 --> 18:14.680
This wine is aw-ful!
Give me another glass.

18:14.681 --> 18:18.447
Well, I think maybe we've
had... Enough wine, sweetheart.

18:18.448 --> 18:20.953
I, I can't feel my tongue.

18:20.954 --> 18:24.557
But I know it's there because I'm talking.

18:24.558 --> 18:27.126
Moira, you should hear what
they're saying about you out there.

18:27.127 --> 18:30.461
- You are doing great.
- No. No, John. No.

18:30.462 --> 18:34.066
No, John, I ruined it. I ruined everything.

18:34.067 --> 18:35.768
- No, no, you didn't.
- I did!

18:35.769 --> 18:39.105
No, sweetheart, I ruined
everything. I ruined it.

18:39.106 --> 18:43.642
You did. Why... Why
did you ruin everything?

18:43.643 --> 18:46.545
Okay, well, let-let's
not focus on me right now.

18:46.546 --> 18:48.114
The important thing is,
you've gotta get back up

18:48.115 --> 18:49.615
and you've gotta get out there.

18:49.616 --> 18:53.152
I can't. Can't.

18:53.153 --> 18:57.056
You can! Moira, remember "Sunrise Bay?"

18:57.057 --> 19:00.126
You were drunk most of season three...

19:00.127 --> 19:04.029
And half of season four.

19:04.030 --> 19:06.298
End of season five.

19:06.299 --> 19:09.668
I'll have to take your word for it.

19:09.669 --> 19:11.737
Did I used to have a drinking problem?

19:11.738 --> 19:16.775
The point is, you can do this, Moira.

19:16.776 --> 19:20.179
You're radiant. You're beguiling.

19:20.180 --> 19:24.016
You're daytime television's brightest star!

19:26.486 --> 19:30.623
All you have to do is
go out there and shine.

19:30.624 --> 19:33.092
I'm gonna.

19:33.093 --> 19:35.628
I'm gonna Nail it.

19:35.629 --> 19:37.129
Okay.

19:39.599 --> 19:42.668
And on a big inhale...

19:42.669 --> 19:46.272
Identify any tension you may be holding.

19:46.273 --> 19:48.941
And on a big exhale, breathe it out.

19:51.678 --> 19:55.781
I burnt my sausage casserole.

19:55.782 --> 19:58.551
I'm pretty sure I'm really lonely here.

19:58.552 --> 20:00.986
Now, with one partner on the ground,

20:00.987 --> 20:03.455
the other comes into a downward dog

20:03.456 --> 20:06.091
with hands on your partner's ankles.

20:18.188 --> 20:20.683
In the... of a picturesque ridge

20:20.692 --> 20:24.562
lies a small, unpretentious winery,

20:24.563 --> 20:28.733
one that pampers its
fruit like its own babies.

20:28.734 --> 20:31.269
Hi! I'm Moira Rose,

20:31.270 --> 20:34.505
and if you love fruit wine as much as I do,

20:34.506 --> 20:36.240
then you'll appreciate the craftsmanship

20:36.241 --> 20:39.911
and quality of a local vintner

20:39.912 --> 20:41.913
who brings the musk melon goodness

20:41.914 --> 20:44.482
to his oak chardonnay,

20:44.483 --> 20:47.685
and the dazzling peach cral-bapple

20:47.686 --> 20:51.456
to his Riesling rioja.

20:51.457 --> 20:55.326
Come taste the difference good
fruit can make in your wine.

20:55.327 --> 20:58.830
You'll remember the experience
and you'll remember the name.

20:58.831 --> 21:00.898
Herb erfling... Ger.

21:00.899 --> 21:02.733
Burt herngeif.

21:02.734 --> 21:05.303
Irv herb-blinger.

21:05.304 --> 21:07.572
Bing livehaanger.

21:07.573 --> 21:10.608
