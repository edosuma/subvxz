00:04.752 --> 00:07.988
Is Reinhardt acting as
an INDIVIDUAL or as
a member of a terrorist group?

00:08.055 --> 00:10.324
- I don't know that.
- Could you give us
the name of the victim?

00:10.391 --> 00:14.929
- Katherine Mcallister.
She was in the bank.
- [ sighs ]

00:14.995 --> 00:18.799
they said there was
a bombing three days ago--
That my wife Katherine was hurt.

00:18.866 --> 00:21.101
- She's in a coma.
- Why'd you do it?

00:21.168 --> 00:23.504
You wouldn't understand.

- We've got a sinus rhythm.
- You almost killed him.

00:31.478 --> 00:34.448
- I'm a psychiatrist.
- You wanna see if I'm crazy?

00:34.515 --> 00:36.517
- Are you crazy?
- Are you?

00:36.584 --> 00:40.854
- As a loon.
- Touch me again, you creep,
I'll smash your other leg!

00:40.921 --> 00:43.791
- Well, we did find
some abnormalities.
- What's wrong?

00:43.857 --> 00:46.594
It means that your child
has down's syndrome.

00:46.660 --> 00:51.599
This is our son.
This is a defective...
accident.

00:51.665 --> 00:55.936
What do you got today?
You got doctors with gym Shoes.
Gym shoes, for crying out loud!

00:56.003 --> 01:00.307
She's crazy about me. I keep
telling her it's only a sexual
relationship and nothing more.

01:00.374 --> 01:02.309
That's good.
Women are suckers
for integrity.

02:31.365 --> 02:34.568

<i>Now we see
numerous discrete areas
of diminished activity...</i>

02:39.173 --> 02:41.242
in Both hepatic Lobes.

02:41.308 --> 02:43.744
Next.

02:43.811 --> 02:47.381
In this biopsy,
we see the adenocarcinoma...

02:47.448 --> 02:51.585
is consistent
with the metastatic
adenocarcinoma of the Stomach.

02:51.652 --> 02:53.787
<i>Next.</i>

02:53.854 --> 02:55.956
<i>Here, we have a focus
of fat necrosis.</i>

02:56.023 --> 02:59.293
Note that some of the nuclei
have disappeared...

02:59.360 --> 03:01.228
and the cell walls
are blurred.

03:01.295 --> 03:04.098
Who took these pictures,
James Garner?

03:04.164 --> 03:06.800
May I have the lights, please?

03:09.036 --> 03:12.373
All right.

03:14.775 --> 03:17.278
What do I tell miss Taylor?

03:17.344 --> 03:21.448
I'm not sure.
That should ease her mind.

03:21.515 --> 03:23.484
Anyone else?

03:23.551 --> 03:28.188
Tell her the truth.
And what exactly
is the truth, Dr. Armstrong?

03:28.255 --> 03:32.393
She's dying.
Would you like to be
the one to tell her?

03:32.459 --> 03:34.461
She has a right to know.
I will if I have to.

03:34.528 --> 03:36.664
Very Good.

03:36.730 --> 03:40.401
<i>And are you going to tell her
when she's gonna die?</i>

03:40.467 --> 03:43.203
What do you mean?
Well, is she gonna die
tomorrow morning,

03:43.270 --> 03:45.205
or is she gonna die
next week?

03:45.272 --> 03:48.676
Next month? Next year?

03:48.742 --> 03:51.111
I don't know.
You don't know.

03:51.178 --> 03:55.583
It would seem that miss Taylor
is in the same predicament
we all are.

03:55.649 --> 03:58.552
We know that someday
We're gonna die.

03:58.619 --> 04:00.554
We just don't know when.

04:00.621 --> 04:03.624
[ chuckles ]
what I'm saying,
Dr. Auschlander--

04:03.691 --> 04:06.193
<i>I know what you're saying,
Dr. Armstrong.</i>

04:06.260 --> 04:10.064
<i>I'm questioning how
you would say it.</i>

04:10.130 --> 04:13.701
Let's all think about that
when we meet with miss Taylor.

04:17.971 --> 04:20.874
We're lucky to have
auschlander around
to discuss this case.

04:20.940 --> 04:24.578
Yeah, it's like Marie Antoinette
talking about the inner
mechanisms of the guillotine.

04:24.645 --> 04:26.580
No, no, no.
Franco's doing fine.

04:26.647 --> 04:29.216
What about Mr. Berman?
Did he have a good night?
Are you kidding?

04:29.283 --> 04:32.653
He was bouncing off the walls
like a Ping-Pong ball
yelling for valium.

04:32.720 --> 04:36.156
I told him yesterday
it was the valium that was
making him hypersensitive.

04:36.223 --> 04:40.794
Sometimes, we suffer from a kind
of schizophrenia around here.
I don't understand.

04:40.861 --> 04:42.796
Well, the doctors,
the nurses, the staff--

04:42.863 --> 04:44.932
We think of this hospital
as a place to work.

04:44.999 --> 04:49.103
And the interns, the residents--
They want it to be
a place to learn, of course.

04:49.169 --> 04:51.505
And the community alternates
between thinking of it...

04:51.572 --> 04:55.342
as a renaissance cathedral
or Frankenstein's castle.

04:55.409 --> 04:58.646
There's talk among the board
about closing this facility...

04:58.712 --> 05:02.349
and moving St. Eligius
to one of the better suburbs,
like Newton or Wellesley.

05:02.416 --> 05:04.518
Judge, I'm well aware
of why you're here today.

05:04.585 --> 05:07.354
That kind of talk has been
going on for a long, long time.

05:07.421 --> 05:10.357
You don't agree with the idea?
No, I don't.

05:10.424 --> 05:12.426
St. Eligius
is part of this neighborhood.

05:12.493 --> 05:16.063
It's like old mrs. Weber,
the crossing guard
at pogansett school,

05:16.130 --> 05:19.300
or that Rusty Fountain
in John Adams square.

05:19.366 --> 05:21.302
You can't take it away
without leaving a hole.

05:21.368 --> 05:23.604
[ Snoring quietly ]

05:23.671 --> 05:26.373
Dr. Osterwald, good morning.
Mm-hmm.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.476
I wouldn't want
that guy examining me.

05:29.543 --> 05:31.845
Too bad. He's the best
cardiologist in new England.

05:31.912 --> 05:33.881
Yeah?

05:38.686 --> 05:40.955
So what happened?
I called sanitation.

05:41.021 --> 05:43.958
Well, they didn't hear you.
We had another kid in here
last night.

05:44.024 --> 05:46.660
Twelve years old.
All right,
I'll call 'em again.

05:46.727 --> 05:49.263
Yeah, make sure you do.
Damn hospital!

05:49.330 --> 05:52.466
Angry young man.
Yes, that's Rooney.
He's an orderly.

05:52.533 --> 05:55.703
You let an orderly
talk to you like that?
He's talking about syringes.

05:55.769 --> 05:58.372
You see, sanitation can't
dispose of them fast enough,

05:58.439 --> 06:00.040
and the kids pick them up
and use them again.

06:00.107 --> 06:02.176
You mean the children
are junkies?

06:02.243 --> 06:04.211
Afraid So.

06:06.046 --> 06:09.183
Next time, try ringing
the doorbell, hmm?

Reinhardt in here, haven't you?

06:12.586 --> 06:15.856

I'm not gonna give you
any more percodan.

There's a call for you

What ticket?
She's your wife, pal.

06:42.116 --> 06:44.285

12:50.050 --> 12:51.986
They come here when
they're hurt or sick.

12:52.052 --> 12:56.156
Some die, and some,
with a little luck,
get better.

12:56.223 --> 12:58.225
What does that have to do
with These poor animals?

12:58.292 --> 13:00.394
Do you know anyone
with diabetes?

13:00.461 --> 13:02.396
Yes, my sister-In-Law Marian.

13:02.463 --> 13:05.199
It's very likely she wouldn't
be alive today if it weren't
for the experiments...

13:05.266 --> 13:08.068
in Insulin therapy conducted
in labs like this using Dogs.

13:08.135 --> 13:10.871
Even so, there's got
to be a better way.

13:10.938 --> 13:13.540
If you find one,
we'll try it.

13:15.409 --> 13:17.378
There you go.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.885
Bon Voyage.

13:28.255 --> 13:30.524
<i>Please sit down.</i>

13:38.432 --> 13:40.367
Before we did
the amniocentesis,

13:40.434 --> 13:43.737
remember we talked about
the kinds of things
we'd be looking for--

13:43.804 --> 13:48.242
how the fluid around the fetus
would indicate if there were
any metabolic abnormalities.

13:50.244 --> 13:52.279
Well, we did find
some abnormalities.

13:52.346 --> 13:55.049
What's wrong?

13:55.115 --> 13:58.152
The 21st chromosome
split into three instead of two.

13:58.219 --> 14:01.388
You see, There are
23 matching pair--
What does this mean?

14:03.023 --> 14:05.092
It means that your child
has down's syndrome.

14:11.632 --> 14:14.368
Are you positive?
Yes.

14:17.004 --> 14:21.141
Doctor, um,
let me ask you something.

14:21.208 --> 14:25.746
In this test, isn't there--
isn't there a lot
of margin for error?

14:25.813 --> 14:30.117
Believe me, Mr. Whitehill,
I wouldn't have told you
unless I was sure.

14:33.921 --> 14:36.490
Well, I'm-I'm not sure I--

14:38.125 --> 14:42.263
the thing
I don't understand is--

14:42.329 --> 14:44.265
How retarded will the baby be?

14:44.331 --> 14:47.334
That's hard to say exactly.

14:47.401 --> 14:51.138
Some Down's children
live Well Into their 20s.
But they are children forever.

14:51.205 --> 14:54.842
The average mental age
is about seven years old,

14:54.909 --> 14:56.911
though some do
considerably Better.

14:58.946 --> 15:01.181
Will the baby
be deformed?

15:01.248 --> 15:03.551
There's a high risk of
some sort of Deformity.

15:03.617 --> 15:06.220
Arched palate, slanted eyes.

15:06.287 --> 15:09.990
God.
I know right now it seems
like the end of the world.

15:10.057 --> 15:15.229
But down's children
are very happy, very special.

15:15.296 --> 15:18.465
- Many parents find
immense pleasure in raising--
- pleasure?

15:20.301 --> 15:22.670
Dr. Cavanero,

15:22.736 --> 15:27.575
the thing
I don't understand is,
what caused this?

15:27.641 --> 15:29.577
We have two perfectly
healthy children.

15:29.643 --> 15:32.980
There's nothing wrong
with either of you.
It's not hereditary.

15:33.047 --> 15:37.251
Sometimes,
it-It just happens.

15:37.318 --> 15:40.354
Uh, Dr. Cavanero,
thank you very much.

15:40.421 --> 15:43.023
I think, Um--

15:43.090 --> 15:45.059
Thank you.

15:46.961 --> 15:49.230
I'd like to give you the number
of a friend of mine...

15:49.296 --> 15:51.498
who works at
a genetic counseling center
at the north end.

15:58.005 --> 16:01.008
- What sex is the baby?
- It's a boy.

16:18.492 --> 16:22.429
Did you have a nice visit
from your sister?
Yeah.

16:22.496 --> 16:25.032
She brought you
a new perfume.

16:25.099 --> 16:27.735
Called "Naughty nights."

16:27.801 --> 16:30.104
Very pleasant.

16:30.170 --> 16:33.207
Feel how lobulated she is.

16:38.812 --> 16:42.249
[ loudly ] does that hurt?
I ain't deaf,
and I ain't senile either.

16:42.316 --> 16:45.352
Gently, gently,
like this.

16:45.419 --> 16:48.923
Easy. That's it.
There we are.

16:48.989 --> 16:50.958
Now you.

16:53.661 --> 16:55.896
Breathe in, please.

16:55.963 --> 16:57.932
Breathe out.

16:59.433 --> 17:01.635
There's a vertical span
of about 20 centimeters.

17:01.702 --> 17:04.838
I see your Ivy's Thriving.

17:04.905 --> 17:07.808
Somebody's sneaking in here
waterin' that plant.

17:10.778 --> 17:13.513
All you young folks
gonna be doctors?

17:13.580 --> 17:16.517
- We are doctors.
- Don't look old enough.

17:16.584 --> 17:19.486
Don't let their
freshly scrubbed faces fool you.

17:21.088 --> 17:24.224
How have you been feeling?

17:24.290 --> 17:26.859
Doc, I've been spittin' up
some green stuff.

17:26.926 --> 17:30.598
We'll give you some medicine
to calm your stomach.
Anything else we can get you?

17:32.399 --> 17:35.536
You can leave
one of these young,
good-Looking doctors here.

17:35.603 --> 17:37.538
[ laughter ]
see you later.

17:44.612 --> 17:47.314
Her liver was hard as a rock.
What treatment
would you suggest?

17:47.381 --> 17:49.316
Radiation therapy.

17:49.383 --> 17:54.989
It may relieve some tension,
but it would have to be limited
to doses under 2,000 rads.

17:55.055 --> 17:56.991
What about chemotherapy?

17:57.057 --> 18:00.160
It may also be used
in appropriate
but futile doses.

18:00.227 --> 18:04.398
Any other ideas?
What about a partial
resection of the liver?

18:04.465 --> 18:09.770
Some of the best answers,
Dr. Morrison,
don't come from textbooks.

18:09.837 --> 18:12.339
I think she knows
she's going to die.

18:12.406 --> 18:16.644
We can try to make her
as comfortable as possible.
What else can we do?

18:27.588 --> 18:29.857
Hi, good-Lookin'.

18:38.065 --> 18:40.034
How's my sweetheart?

18:41.435 --> 18:44.572
'cause that's what
you are, you know--
my sweetheart.

18:44.638 --> 18:48.909
It snowed last night
in Minneapolis.

18:48.976 --> 18:51.645
It did.

18:51.712 --> 18:55.616
So we're gonna get those skis,
the broslams,

18:55.683 --> 18:59.019
and we're gonna cross-Country
all the way to bear Lake.

19:00.321 --> 19:03.390
Only this time,
we're gonna take the Brandy.

19:08.429 --> 19:10.998

My brother enjoyed
living on the dairy farm.

19:23.978 --> 19:28.115
Loved those cows.
Married a woman named bossie...

19:28.182 --> 19:30.818

listen, if either of you'd
like a shot at this--

19:39.960 --> 19:44.331
It's very simple.
It's a little like, um,
slicing cheese.

19:44.398 --> 19:47.835
Don't you find the
music distracting?

19:47.902 --> 19:52.139

Excuse me, doctor,
but what's a Bull bank?

this word from our sponsor.

<i>Are you serious?</i>

20:35.182 --> 20:37.851
Would you rather he spent
the rest of his life

20:37.918 --> 20:40.454
We could take care
of him here.
Oh, yeah.

20:40.521 --> 20:42.890
Yeah, we know a lot about
raising a damaged child.

20:42.957 --> 20:44.858
We could learn.

20:44.925 --> 20:49.263
Teach all
the babysitters too?
Other people have done it.

20:49.330 --> 20:54.168
Look, it's just wrong
to bring a child into this world
with that many disadvantages.

20:54.235 --> 20:57.838
Life is hard Enough.
Who says we get
to choose for him?

20:57.905 --> 21:00.708
My responsibility
is to this family.

21:00.774 --> 21:02.743

I don't think so.

I've just been
so stupid this year.

27:01.468 --> 27:04.104
I used all my sick days
for sickness.

27:04.171 --> 27:06.173
Is Andrew Reinhardt
your patient now?

27:06.240 --> 27:08.342
Yeah. How'd you
put up with him?

27:08.409 --> 27:12.947
"Shamash"?
shamash.

27:13.013 --> 27:16.884
Sounds like
a kosher sandwich.
What's it mean?

27:16.951 --> 27:20.120
Well, um, shamash...

27:20.187 --> 27:23.257

27:25.292 --> 27:27.228
Yeah, sun god of Assyria.

27:27.294 --> 27:30.965
Twenty-Three points.
I've had enough.

27:31.031 --> 27:33.601
I hate to tell you this, V.J.,
but I think you're suffering...

27:33.667 --> 27:35.603
from An acute case
of Lexicography.

27:35.669 --> 27:37.705
Sure, a few of them die.

27:37.771 --> 27:40.040
But look how many drop dead...

27:41.942 --> 27:45.646
without any help
from their doctors.

27:45.713 --> 27:50.150
Though, to be totally Frank,
the young resident today
is a complete klutz.

27:50.217 --> 27:52.987
I mean, in my day,
we were taught ethics,

27:53.053 --> 27:56.457
codes of behavior,
respect for seniority.

27:56.523 --> 27:59.226
What do you got today?
You got doctors with gym Shoes.

27:59.293 --> 28:01.161
Gym shoes,
for crying out loud,

28:01.228 --> 28:04.265
as if we were
running a track meet
instead of a hospital.

28:04.331 --> 28:08.702
Am I right, Hugh?
Oh, you know how I hate
to disagree with you, mark.

28:08.769 --> 28:11.639
Brian's older brother, David,
is dead,

28:11.705 --> 28:15.709
and his other brother, well,
he'll never get married.

28:15.776 --> 28:20.981
Well, he's always wanted a son
to carry on the family name.

28:21.048 --> 28:24.818
Do you have any children,
Dr. Cavanero?
No, I'm not married.

28:24.885 --> 28:27.154
Any brothers or sisters?

28:27.221 --> 28:29.823
Yes. One brother,
four sisters.

28:32.059 --> 28:37.064
Well, I was an only child.

28:37.131 --> 28:40.234
When I was growing up,
I always wanted lots
of brothers and sisters.

28:40.301 --> 28:44.271

when I got married,
I'd have five of each.

28:50.010 --> 28:53.147
That's really
not the question here.

28:53.213 --> 28:55.950
I know you're not
supposed to say--
I know what you mean.

28:58.252 --> 29:01.789
What I'm trying to say
is that in this situation,

29:01.855 --> 29:04.358
advice is easy when
you're not directly involved.

29:04.425 --> 29:07.728
It's very complicated,
isn't it?

29:09.730 --> 29:12.866
What about your mother?
What do you mean?

29:12.933 --> 29:15.569
What would she have done?

29:15.636 --> 29:17.538
My mother would have
had the baby.

29:17.605 --> 29:19.506
But, then again,
she's a very
traditional woman.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.512
So am I.

29:25.579 --> 29:28.649
Well, eventually,
I wanna be a scrub nurse.

29:28.716 --> 29:32.319
I know. You think it's funny
a punk like me wants to do more
than clean up afterbirth.

29:32.386 --> 29:36.023
No. It's just that
I've been thinking of Quitting.

29:36.090 --> 29:39.426
Going to another hospital?
Getting out of
nursing altogether.

29:39.493 --> 29:41.562
Why's that?

29:41.629 --> 29:45.165
Too many Forms to fill out,
too many hostile patients,

29:45.232 --> 29:47.167
too many hostile doctors.

29:47.234 --> 29:49.670
Aw, come on.
It ain't that bad.

29:49.737 --> 29:52.506
Most doctors
are rich White men
who don't give a damn...

about my feelings
or Opinions.

29:55.075 --> 29:58.245
