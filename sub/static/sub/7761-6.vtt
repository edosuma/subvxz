WEBVTT

00:10.144 --> 00:13.647
- ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,
FIVE, SIX, SHAKE IT, DUDE.

00:13.681 --> 00:21.622
*

00:35.436 --> 00:37.471
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:37.505 --> 00:44.445
*

00:46.314 --> 00:49.583
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:49.617 --> 00:52.820
* CUE THE PULSE
TO BEGIN *

00:52.853 --> 00:56.124
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

01:06.200 --> 01:08.102
- HEY.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:08.136 --> 01:12.373
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?
both: CHEERS.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.308
- THAT NEW CAMPAIGN
YOU CAME UP WITH FOR US

01:14.342 --> 01:16.110
IS A STROKE OF GENIUS.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.212
- OH, THANKS, CHARLIE.
- OF COURSE.

01:18.246 --> 01:19.880
- I COULDN'T AGREE
WITH YOU MORE.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.483
- [laughs]

01:22.516 --> 01:24.452
- SO THESE ARE THE PEOPLE
WHO MAKE YOU RICH?

01:24.485 --> 01:29.190
- MM-HMM.
GOD LOVE 'EM.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.858
AND...

01:30.891 --> 01:34.128
HERE'S YOUR CUT OF THE ACTION.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.896
- BRIAN...

01:35.929 --> 01:37.865
- THE CONCERNED CITIZENS
FOR THE TRUTH

01:37.898 --> 01:40.401
WOULD LIKE TO THANK
THE CITIZENS OF LIBERTY AVENUE

01:40.434 --> 01:42.503
FOR THEIR GENEROUS SUPPORT.

01:42.536 --> 01:43.804
- BRIAN, IT WAS A GIFT,

01:43.837 --> 01:47.541
A WAY OF SAYING THANK YOU.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.410
- WELL, NOW IT'S MY TURN.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.479
BESIDES, YOU KNOW ME.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.514
I'LL ONLY BLOW IT
ON BOOZE AND DEBAUCHERY

01:53.547 --> 01:55.216
AND THE ARMANI SPRING
COLLECTION.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.884
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,
CASE CLOSED.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.752
- JEANETTE AND ANNA
HAVE THEIR SON BACK,

01:58.786 --> 02:01.289
AND AN UNFAIR DECISION'S
BEEN OVERTURNED.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.890
- AH, CONGRATULATIONS, MEL.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.558
- WELL, I OWE IT ALL TO YOU.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.560
- MMM...
ME?

02:06.594 --> 02:07.761
- FOR REMINDING ME
TO HAVE THE COURAGE

02:07.795 --> 02:09.430
TO CHANGE THE THINGS I CAN

02:09.463 --> 02:12.900
AND THE WISDOM TO ACCEPT
THE THINGS I CAN'T.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.902
- YEAH, STILL WORKING
ON THAT MYSELF.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.637
- YEAH, I TRIED
TO MAKE IT WORK,

02:16.670 --> 02:18.639
BUT, UM, LIVING ALONE
WAS JUST TOO FUCKING LONELY.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.708
- AND TOO LONELY FUCKING.
RIGHT, EM?

02:20.741 --> 02:22.776
- NOW SHE'S LIVING IN SIN.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.712
- OR RIGHT ACROSS THE HALL
FROM IT.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.515
- JUST MAKE SURE TO PUT
THE TOILET SEAT DOWN.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.250
DEB GETS A LITTLE TOUCHY.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.519
- ESPECIALLY AT 2:00
IN THE MORNING.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.521
LISTEN, I'D RATHER FALL IN
THAN HAVE TO PUT UP

02:33.554 --> 02:36.257
WITH THAT INGRATE
I USED TO LIVE WITH.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.591
- THE INGRATITUDE
OF THOSE PUBLISHERS,

02:37.625 --> 02:39.827
REJECTING YOUR SECOND NOVEL.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.795
- WELL, WHEN IT COMES
TO THE BOTTOM LINE,

02:41.829 --> 02:43.531
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS LOYALTY.

02:43.564 --> 02:46.834
- YOU'LL FIND ANOTHER PUBLISHER.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.672
- ATTENTION.

02:51.705 --> 02:52.940
ATTENTION, EVERYONE.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.676
- COME WITH ME.
- OOH.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.546
- HE'S GONNA GIVE A SPEECH.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.281
- UM...
[clears throat]

03:00.314 --> 03:01.815
I'D LIKE TO THANK MY CLIENTS...

03:01.849 --> 03:03.284
- THANK YOU.

03:03.317 --> 03:06.687
- UM, MY EMPLOYEES...
OH.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.957
AND MY FRIENDS
FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT

03:09.990 --> 03:12.426
TO HELP LAUNCH KINNETIK.

03:12.460 --> 03:17.698
[cheers and applause]

03:17.731 --> 03:19.300
[clears throat]

03:19.333 --> 03:21.469
IT HASN'T BEEN EASY.

03:21.502 --> 03:24.004
THEY SAY
THAT THE MARKET IS SHRINKING.

03:24.037 --> 03:29.343
THEY SAY THAT IT'S THE WRONG
TIME TO START A NEW AGENCY.

03:29.377 --> 03:31.912
WELL, I SAY...

03:31.945 --> 03:34.448
"DON'T BELIEVE A FUCKING WORD."
[laughter]

03:34.482 --> 03:37.451
ESPECIALLY IN ADVERTISING.

03:37.485 --> 03:40.588
[applause]

03:40.621 --> 03:42.590
- THE GUY'S GOT BALLS.

03:42.623 --> 03:46.594
- YOU DON'T KNOW
THE HALF OF 'EM.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.562
[cheers and applause]

03:54.034 --> 03:57.638
- SIS.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.343
SIS.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.612
WAITRESS!
- BETTY, HON, YOU WANT TO TAKE

04:04.645 --> 04:06.280
TABLE NUMBER FIVE?
I'M BUSY.

04:06.314 --> 04:10.518
- SURE, DEB.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.486
WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU GENTS?

04:12.520 --> 04:14.922
- MY FUCKING SISTER.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.924
- JUSTIN, JUSTIN.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.926
CHECK THIS OUT.
- WHAT IS IT?

04:18.959 --> 04:21.629
- IT'S AN EMAIL,
BUT LOOK WHO IT'S FROM.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.664
- BRETT KELLER.
THE DIRECTOR?

04:23.697 --> 04:27.535
- YEAH, RATMAN 2,
PHARMACY COWBOY, V-MEN.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.969
HE SAYS
HE'S A BIG FAN OF RAGE.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.904
- THAT'S AWESOME.
- YEAH.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.373
ESPECIALLY IN THE PART
WHERE HE SAYS

04:32.406 --> 04:34.041
HE WANTS TO MAKE IT
INTO A MOVIE.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.544
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
A MOVIE?

04:36.577 --> 04:38.546
- A MOVIE?
WHO'S MAKING A MOVIE?

04:38.579 --> 04:40.381
- BRETT KELLER WOULD LIKE TO...

04:40.414 --> 04:42.049
"FLOAT THE POSSIBILITY
OF TURNING

04:42.082 --> 04:46.520
YOUR BRILLIANT COMIC BOOK
INTO A LIVE-ACTION FEATURE."

04:46.554 --> 04:48.689
- OH MY GOD!
OH, MICHAEL!

04:48.722 --> 04:51.525
I- I ALWAYS SAID YOU'D BE RICH
AND FAMOUS ONE DAY.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.794
I DID. OH MY GOD,
I-I CAN'T BREATHE.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.529
GOD, I CAN'T BREATHE.
- DEB, TAKE IT EASY.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.797
- OH, HONEY.
- MA, SIT DOWN.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.432
- BETTY, COULD YOU BRING
SOME WATER?

04:58.466 --> 05:00.501
- SURE THING.
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SIS?

05:00.534 --> 05:01.702
- I'M PERFECTLY FINE.

05:01.735 --> 05:04.004
THERE'S NO NEED
TO CONCERN YOURSELF.

05:04.037 --> 05:07.541
- BRETT KELLER WANTS TO MAKE
A MOVIE OUT OF RAGE.

05:07.575 --> 05:10.344
- WELL, CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU TWO.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.012
WHEN'S THE PREMIERE?

05:12.045 --> 05:13.080
- HE'S TAKING HIS MOTHER.

05:13.113 --> 05:18.018
YOU CAN RENT IT AT BLOCKBUSTER.

05:18.051 --> 05:19.953
- WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO LET UP
ON UNCLE VIC?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.555
- I DON'T WISH TO DISCUSS
MY BROTHER.

05:21.589 --> 05:24.425
I'M STILL WAITING
ON THAT SIDE OF SLAW.

05:24.458 --> 05:28.429
- JUST BECAUSE HE DIDN'T INVITE
YOU TO HIS DINNER PARTY?

05:28.462 --> 05:31.465
- IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

05:31.499 --> 05:34.835
HE OBVIOUSLY JUST DOESN'T WANT
ME AROUND ANY MORE.

05:34.868 --> 05:38.005
- YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.607
HE HAS HIS OWN LIFE NOW.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.710
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE LOVES YOU ANY LESS.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.445
HEY.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.848
REMEMBER WHAT YOU
ALWAYS TOLD ME?

05:47.881 --> 05:51.519
"BLOOD IS THICKER
THAN MARINARA SAUCE."

05:58.058 --> 06:01.495
- IF THAT'S HOW SHE WANTS IT,
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO,

06:01.529 --> 06:05.032
EXCEPT GO ON WITH YOUR LIFE.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.968
- THANKS.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.511
- I THOUGHT WE MIGHT ARRANGE
THE LANDSCAPES

06:17.545 --> 06:21.449
ACCORDING TO SEASON.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.684
LINDSAY?
- HMM?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.052
OH.
OH, SORRY, SIDNEY.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.754
- I SAID I WAS THINKING

06:26.787 --> 06:28.922
WE COULD ARRANGE THE LANDSCAPES
ACCORDING TO SEASON.

06:28.956 --> 06:32.593
- SURE.
GREAT IDEA.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.763
- WHAT ARE YOU READING?
YOUR HOROSCOPE?

06:35.796 --> 06:37.765
- THE NEW AUERBACH MURAL.

06:37.798 --> 06:41.502
- AH. I STOPPED BY YESTERDAY
TO TAKE A PEEK.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.770
PRETTY AMAZING.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.938
- I'VE ALWAYS LOVED HIS WORK.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.675
HE'S ALWAYS EVOLVING AND ALWAYS
CHALLENGING HIMSELF.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.042
- YEAH.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.644
- HEY, SIDNEY,
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK

06:50.678 --> 06:52.045
OF DOING AN EXHIBIT OF HIS WORK

06:52.079 --> 06:53.647
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MURAL?

06:53.681 --> 06:56.183
- IT'D BE A DREAM COME TRUE.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.918
EXCEPT THAT IT WON'T.

06:57.951 --> 07:02.089
HIS NEW YORK REP ALREADY TOLD
THE CARNEGIE GALLERY NO.

07:02.122 --> 07:05.192
- WELL, THERE'S NO HARM
IN ASKING HIM OURSELVES.

07:05.225 --> 07:08.529
MY HOROSCOPE SAID,
"TAKE A CHANCE."

07:08.562 --> 07:11.965
- I SUGGEST THAT IT'S TIME TO
GET OUR HEAD OUT OF THE STARS

07:11.999 --> 07:14.101
AND GET BACK DOWN TO EARTH.

07:14.134 --> 07:19.006
NOW I THINK WE SHOULD ARRANGE

07:19.039 --> 07:21.208
THE LANDSCAPES
INTO SEASONS.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.743
- [chuckles]
OKAY.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.112
- HE WANTS TO MAKE RAGE
INTO A MOVIE.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.213
- SO?
- BRETT KELLER?

07:26.246 --> 07:28.248
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.818
- ARE THESE RATES FIRM?
- AS MY ABS.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.252
I BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE MACHINES.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.821
- DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?

07:33.854 --> 07:35.556
- YEAH, HE WANTS TO MAKE IT
INTO A MOVIE.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.124
TELL THEM WE'LL BOOK
THE NEXT THREE ISSUES

07:37.157 --> 07:38.158
IF THEY KNOCK OFF 15%.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.860
- AREN'T YOU PROUD OF ME?

07:39.893 --> 07:42.162
I'M GOING TO BE RICH.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.897
- GOOD.
NOW YOU CAN PAY BACK

07:43.931 --> 07:46.834
THE THOUSANDS I SPENT
ON YOUR ABORTED EDUCATION.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.970
- WHO NEEDS SCHOOL
WHEN YOU HAVE A PICTURE DEAL?

07:50.003 --> 07:52.706
- YOU STILL WON'T HAVE A DEGREE.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.708
- I ALREADY HAVE AN IDEA
FOR THE FIRST FEATURE.

07:54.742 --> 07:58.011
ASSUMING, OF COURSE, THERE ARE
GOING TO BE NUMEROUS SEQUELS.

07:58.045 --> 08:01.114
J.T. GETS EVEN
WITH HIS BASHERS,

08:01.148 --> 08:05.152
GOES TO HOLLYWOOD,
AND BECOMES A STAR.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.988
- WOW.
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT BRAINSTORM?

08:08.021 --> 08:11.759
- HOW ABOUT WE GO TO BABYLON
LATER AND CELEBRATE?

08:11.792 --> 08:15.896
- SORRY.
IT'S A SCHOOL NIGHT.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.031
CYNTHIA, WHEN IS THE DEADLINE
ON THAT RUN?

08:18.065 --> 08:21.301
- NOON TOMORROW.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.137
- HEY, SPIELBERG.
- [grunts]

08:24.171 --> 08:29.209
- ONE DRINK.
- OH, OKAY.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.622
- HERE YOU GO, HONEY.
- OHH.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.156
- I PUT SOME MINIATURE
MARSHMALLOWS ON TOP.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.293
- [gasps]
I LOVE MINIATURE MARSHMALLOWS.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.662
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF THEM
AS ANGELS' BALLS.

08:48.696 --> 08:51.231
- [chuckles]
IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THEY GOT 'EM.

08:51.264 --> 08:54.702
WHOA!
THAT IS ONE FUCKING RED DOOR.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.571
- IT'S NOT "FUCKING RED,"
IT'S "JUNGLE RED."

08:57.605 --> 08:59.640
AND I FIGURED, SINCE YOU'RE
THE MOST COLORFUL PERSON

08:59.673 --> 09:01.775
ON THE BLOCK,
WHY NOT HAVE A DOOR TO MATCH?

09:01.809 --> 09:04.111
- HA!
IT'S NICE.

09:04.144 --> 09:07.080
[car door shuts]

09:07.114 --> 09:09.216
HEY, TEDDY!
- HEY, DEB.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.684
- HI, HONEY.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.085
WANNA COME IN
FOR SOME HOT CHOCOLATE?

09:12.119 --> 09:13.921
- UH...
NO.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.989
THANKS, I'M NOT--
I'M NOT STAYING.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.592
- TOO BAD.
WELL, IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,

09:18.626 --> 09:20.961
I GOT A FRESH BAG
OF ANGELS' BALLS.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.674
- WELL, AREN'T YOU GONNA MAKE
SOME CAUSTIC REMARK?

09:33.707 --> 09:34.942
- ABOUT WHAT?

09:34.975 --> 09:37.277
- MY MOVING IN WITH DEB.

09:37.310 --> 09:40.347
YOU KNOW, THE "NOW EMMETT'S GOT
HIS OWN PERSONAL FAG HAG."

09:40.380 --> 09:42.249
- I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.351
LIVING ALONE
WOULD'VE DRIVEN YOU NUTS,

09:44.384 --> 09:46.219
AND I'M SURE DEB ENJOYS HAVING
A NEW ROOMIE.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.221
SO ALL IN ALL I'D SAY
IT'S AN IDEAL ARRANGEMENT.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.958
- ALMOST AS PERFECT
AS YOUR WORKING FOR BRIAN.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.694
- I TOLD HIM HE'S BETTING
ON A LOSER,

09:53.727 --> 09:55.228
BUT WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST TIME A LONG SHOT

09:55.262 --> 09:56.830
CAME FROM BEHIND, I GUESS.

09:56.864 --> 10:02.135
- WE'LL CALL YOU SEABISCUIT.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.105
- [clears throat]
AS--AS PART OF MY RECOVERY,

10:05.138 --> 10:07.107
I'M TRYING TO MAKE AMENDS
FOR MY BEHAVIOR,

10:07.140 --> 10:10.878
SO I'VE WRITTEN LETTERS
APOLOGIZING TO EVERYONE.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.413
MICHAEL, BEN, BRIAN,

10:13.446 --> 10:17.885
MEL AND LINDS...

10:17.918 --> 10:20.320
YOU.
- [chuckles]

10:20.353 --> 10:22.022
LAST AS ALWAYS.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.758
- DAMN IT, EMMETT,
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT LAST.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.627
OR LEAST.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.904
- IT'S VERY ADMIRABLE, TED,

10:36.937 --> 10:40.140
ADMITTING YOUR MISTAKES.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.309
DID EVERYONE FORGIVE YOU?
- SO FAR.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.277
- MUST MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.779
- CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW RELIEVED I AM.

10:45.813 --> 10:49.216
- GOOD FOR YOU.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.154
BUT WHAT'S READING
THIS LETTER...

10:54.187 --> 10:55.188
GONNA DO FOR ME?

10:55.222 --> 10:57.090
HMM?

10:57.124 --> 11:00.060
WILL IT TAKE AWAY
ALL THE DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN DONE?

11:00.093 --> 11:03.063
ALL THE PAIN
THAT'S BEEN INFLICTED?

11:03.096 --> 11:08.335
WILL IT MAKE UP FOR MY FEELING
INADEQUATE AND HELPLESS?

11:08.368 --> 11:10.838
OR ERASE
ALL THOSE MEMORIES OF YOU

11:10.871 --> 11:12.372
DESCENDING INTO YOUR ADDICTION,

11:12.405 --> 11:18.478
WHILE YOU TRIED TO DRAG ME DOWN
WITH YOU?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.347
SORRY, TEDDY.

11:20.380 --> 11:24.985
YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO GET YOUR
FEEL-GOOD FIX FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.230
[laughter]

11:37.264 --> 11:40.801
- THAT'S SO TIGHT.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.370
- SHIT.
- THAT'S SO COOL.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.938
OH!
- WHOA!

11:44.972 --> 11:47.207
- OH!

11:47.240 --> 11:48.976
[laughs]

11:49.009 --> 11:52.212
FIRST I'M GOING
TO PAY OFF MY MOM'S HOUSE,

11:52.245 --> 11:54.948
THEN I'M GOING TO PUT A DOWN
PAYMENT ON A HOUSE FOR US.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.751
THEN I'M GOING TO BUY A CAR.
- A PORSCHE CARRERA.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.853
- IT'S ONLY A TWO-SEATER.
- DON'T WORRY.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.822
WE'LL LET YOU RIDE IN IT
ONCE IN A WHILE.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.957
RIGHT, BEN?
- RIGHT, PAL.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.993
ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW
WHICH FANTASY'S CRAZIER,

12:06.026 --> 12:08.161
THE ONE YOU'RE WATCHING OR THE
ONE YOU'RE TELLING YOURSELVES.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.363
- WHY IS IT SO CRAZY?

12:10.397 --> 12:12.499
- JUST BECAUSE HE SAYS HE WANTS
TO MAKE IT INTO A MOVIE

12:12.532 --> 12:14.768
DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL EVER SEE
THE LIGHT OF DAY.

12:14.802 --> 12:17.971
- THIS PART'S SO COOL.
- I DON'T KNOW WHY NOT.

12:18.005 --> 12:19.239
- I CAN JUST SEE RAGE
DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.373
- THOSE GUYS TALK BIG,

12:20.407 --> 12:23.110
BUT WE'LL SEE IF THEY DELIVER.

12:23.143 --> 12:25.378
- WHO'S GOING TO PLAY RAGE?

12:25.412 --> 12:28.015
- TOM CRUISE.
BRAD PITT.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.149
- THOSE GEEZERS?

12:29.182 --> 12:31.852
YOU GOT TO GET ASHTON KUTCHER.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.120
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:33.153 --> 12:34.554
- SOME OF US NON-HOLLYWOOD TYPES

12:34.587 --> 12:36.123
HAVE A FACULTY MEETING
IN THE MORNING.

12:36.156 --> 12:39.459
COME ON, STAY AND WATCH
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.161
I'LL SIT ON YOUR LAP.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.430
- BRETT KELLER FILM
ISN'T MY THING.

12:43.463 --> 12:46.299
- V-MEN WAS ONE OF THE TOP
GROSSERS OF LAST YEAR.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.902
- ALL THAT PROVES IS THERE ARE
A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE

12:48.936 --> 12:49.903
WHO DON'T MIND SETTLING
FOR MINDLESS ENTERTAINMENT.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.038
- THAT'S WHY I LIKE IT.

12:51.071 --> 12:54.875
- DON'T COME TO BED TOO LATE.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.543
- FUCKING AWESOME!

12:56.576 --> 12:58.879
- [laughs]
MM.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.280
- OHH!
- YEAH!

13:00.313 --> 13:02.182
- [laughs]

13:17.264 --> 13:22.069
- AND THEN ADD MORE WHITE
TO THE RED.

13:22.102 --> 13:25.939
- EXCUSE ME, I'M LOOKING
FOR MR. AUERBACH.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.314
EXCUSE ME,
IS SAM AUERBACH HERE?

13:34.347 --> 13:37.317
- YOU CALL THIS A BAGEL?

13:37.350 --> 13:40.320
- YOU MIGHT SAY HIS PRESENCE
IS EVERYWHERE.

13:40.353 --> 13:43.323
- A LOX WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT DEAD
ON THIS.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.093
- SORRY, SAM.

13:46.126 --> 13:49.229
IF I WERE YOU, I'D FLEE
HIS WRATH AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.531
WILL SOMEONE FIND ME
A REAL BAGEL?

13:51.564 --> 13:55.235
AND A SCHMEAR.
- I'M ON IT, SAM.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.104
- GOTTA RUN.
- YEAH.

13:57.137 --> 14:01.041
- I DON'T KNOW HOW THE HELL ANDY
LIVED IN THIS GODFORSAKEN BURG,

14:01.074 --> 14:04.945
BUT I SURE AS HELL
KNOW WHY HE LEFT.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.947
- MR. AUERBACH?
- YEAH. WHO ARE YOU?

14:06.980 --> 14:09.216
- MY NAME IS LINDSAY PETERSON.
- I NEED THAT PAINT MIXED.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.118
WHERE THE FUCK IS JEROME?

14:11.151 --> 14:13.954
- YOU JUST SENT HIM OUT
FOR BAGELS.

14:13.987 --> 14:17.224
MR. AUERBACH, I'M
A TREMENDOUS FAN OF YOUR WORK.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.492
I-I-I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY
THE MOST BRILLIANT PAINTER...

14:19.526 --> 14:21.661
- I KNOW.
I KNOW. I'M, UH...

14:21.694 --> 14:24.397
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME A MOMENT, I
GOTTA PEE LIKE A SON OF A BITCH.

14:24.431 --> 14:29.669
- I'LL SPEAK QUICKLY.
- [sighs]

14:29.702 --> 14:31.004
I'LL TRY TO HOLD IT.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.539
- THANK YOU.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.107
I'M FROM THE SIDNEY BLOOM
GALLERY,

14:34.141 --> 14:35.142
AND WE WERE HOPING
WE MIGHT INTEREST YOU

14:35.175 --> 14:36.643
IN A SHOW OF YOUR RECENT WORKS,

14:36.676 --> 14:39.679
INCLUDING PERHAPS SOME DRAWINGS
FOR THE MURAL?

14:39.712 --> 14:43.016
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST TAKE IT UP
WITH MY AGENT?

14:43.050 --> 14:45.685
- I FEEL THE PERSONAL TOUCH
IS ALWAYS THE BEST.

14:45.718 --> 14:51.258
- MIRANDA, HONEY,
WOULD YOU JUST, UH,

14:51.291 --> 14:54.161
TAKE THESE BRUSHES
UP THERE FOR ME?

14:54.194 --> 14:57.397
- SURE, SAM.

14:57.430 --> 15:01.434
- SEE, NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL
THE PERSONAL TOUCH.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.541
- IF I HAVE TO LISTEN TO MOANING
MONA CRY ONE MORE TIME

15:08.575 --> 15:10.210
ABOUT HOW SHE MISSES HER PILLS,
I'M GOING TO SHOVE

15:10.243 --> 15:12.712
A GODDAMN PERCOCET
DOWN HER THROAT MYSELF.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.548
- THERE'S A LESSON
IN EVERY STORY.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.285
- AND THE LESSON TODAY WAS:
YOU CAN BE A HOPELESS ADDICT,

15:18.318 --> 15:21.554
YOU CAN DESTROY YOUR LIFE AND
THE LIFE OF EVERYONE AROUND YOU,

15:21.588 --> 15:23.056
BUT DON'T BORE YOUR AUDIENCE.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.724
- JUST KEEP COMING.
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.695
- MONA WILL WORK HER STEPS,
AND YOU'LL WORK YOURS.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.297
- YEAH.
EXCEPT I SEEM TO HAVE FORGOTTEN

15:30.330 --> 15:32.199
WHERE MY STEPS ARE LEADING ME.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.301
- SOBRIETY.
WHOLENESS.

15:34.334 --> 15:38.438
- I DON'T MEAN THAT.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.073
LOOK, IF WHAT EMMETT SAYS
WAS TRUE,

15:40.107 --> 15:41.341
THAT THE ONLY REASON
THAT I'M WRITING THESE

15:41.374 --> 15:42.709
IS SO THAT EVERYONE
WILL FORGIVE ME

15:42.742 --> 15:44.311
AND I CAN FEEL GOOD
ABOUT MYSELF,

15:44.344 --> 15:45.312
THEN THAT'S REALLY NO DIFFERENT
THAN THE WAY

15:45.345 --> 15:48.982
I WAS USING THEM BEFORE.

15:49.016 --> 15:52.485
IN WHICH CASE HE WAS RIGHT
NOT TO ACCEPT IT.

15:52.519 --> 15:55.722
- LOOK, I KNOW IT'S UPSETTING.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.724
THE PERSON YOU MOST WANTED
TO HEAR YOU REFUSED TO LISTEN.

15:57.757 --> 16:01.361
BUT YOU CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR HIS REACTION.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.463
- JUST SPARE ME
THE A.A. BULLSHIT, WOULD YOU?

16:03.496 --> 16:04.731
- YOU OFFERED HIM YOUR TRUTH.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.466
- YEAH, "MY TRUTH."

16:06.499 --> 16:10.237
- THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.139
- WELL, IF THAT'S
ALL THAT MATTERS,

16:12.172 --> 16:16.776
HOW COME YOU'VE NEVER OFFERED
ME YOUR TRUTH?

16:16.809 --> 16:18.645
HMM?

16:23.050 --> 16:25.485
YOU KNOW, I'M GOING
TO SKIP THE COFFEE.

16:25.518 --> 16:28.121
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

16:34.794 --> 16:36.363
- SIS.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.031
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.267
- I GUESS I KIND OF OVERREACTED
THE OTHER NIGHT,

16:40.300 --> 16:41.534
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW ME.

16:41.568 --> 16:45.038
- QUEEN OF THE DRAMA QUEENS.

16:45.072 --> 16:47.774
SO HOW ABOUT A PIECE
OF KUGELHOF?

16:47.807 --> 16:49.776
I JUST BAKED IT.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.778
- THAT'S WHAT I MISS.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.047
THE SMELL OF YOUR KUGELHOF.

16:54.081 --> 16:58.785
- I BAKED AN EXTRA ONE FOR YOU.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.653
I'M SORRY
IF YOU WERE HURT, SIS.

17:00.687 --> 17:04.057
YOU KNOW THAT'S THE LAST THING
I'D EVER WANT TO DO.

17:04.091 --> 17:06.526
- I KNOW THAT, BABY.
- IT'S JUST THAT...

17:06.559 --> 17:08.395
I'M ENTITLED TO MY OWN LIFE.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.163
- WHO SAID YOU WEREN'T?

17:10.197 --> 17:12.165
- ESPECIALLY AFTER ALL IT TOOK
FOR ME TO GET IT.

17:12.199 --> 17:15.402
- HMM, YOU AND ME BOTH.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.437
- SO THEN LET'S BE HAPPY THAT...

17:17.470 --> 17:19.439
WE EACH FINALLY HAVE
OUR OWN LIVES.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.409
- WELL, YEAH,
YOU CERTAINLY DO.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.711
A SWEET LITTLE APARTMENT
AND A BOYFRIEND.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.714
- LIFE PARTNER.
- LIFE PARTNER.

17:27.747 --> 17:32.152
- IT'S A MIRACLE.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.687
- OF COURSE,
IT TAKES A MIRACLE WORKER

17:34.721 --> 17:37.290
TO MAKE A MIRACLE HAPPEN.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.826
AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING
ABOUT THE GOOD LORD ABOVE.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.461
- I KNOW, SIS, I KNOW.

17:41.494 --> 17:42.729
HOW ABOUT A PIECE OF KUGELHOF?

17:42.762 --> 17:44.431
- I'M TALKING SHEER WILL

17:44.464 --> 17:46.699
AND HARD WORK AND SACRIFICES.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.435
LOTS OF SACRIFICES.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.836
YOU KNOW,
LIKE MY NURSING YOU MYSELF

17:49.869 --> 17:51.704
WHEN YOUR HEALTH INSURANCE
RAN OUT.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.840
CLEANING UP YOUR VOMIT
AND WIPING YOUR ASS.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.775
- JESUS CHRIST,
IF I HAVE TO HEAR ABOUT YOU

17:55.808 --> 17:57.610
WIPING MY ASS ONE MORE TIME...

17:57.644 --> 18:00.447
- WELL, IF I HAD TO DO IT,
YOU CAN FUCKING HEAR ABOUT IT.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.882
I MEAN, WHO ELSE WOULD'VE DONE
IT IF IT WASN'T FOR ME?

18:02.915 --> 18:05.118
IF I HADN'T TAKEN YOU IN,
WHERE WOULD YOU HAVE GONE?

18:05.152 --> 18:07.887
WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED TO YOU?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.756
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT,

18:09.789 --> 18:11.724
SO I'M JUST SAYING...

18:11.758 --> 18:14.194
DON'T FORGET WHO PUT
THEIR LIFE ON HOLD

18:14.227 --> 18:15.862
SO THAT YOU ONE DAY
COULD LIVE YOURS.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.498
- I'LL NEVER FORGET
AND I'LL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL.

18:18.531 --> 18:22.502
BUT I NEVER ASKED OR EXPECTED
YOU TO SACRIFICE YOUR LIFE.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.138
- WELL, HOW ELSE
WAS IT GONNA HAPPEN?

18:25.172 --> 18:26.906
BY MAGIC?

18:26.939 --> 18:29.642
- I'D BE DAMNED IF I WAS GONNA
LET THAT DISEASE GET YOU,

18:29.676 --> 18:32.245
NOT AS LONG AS I HAD ONE OUNCE
OF STRENGTH LEFT.

18:35.282 --> 18:39.219
WHY ELSE DO YOU THINK I DID IT?

18:39.252 --> 18:42.789
"I THOUGHT YOU DID IT
FOR ME, MAMA."

18:46.393 --> 18:49.796
- WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

18:49.829 --> 18:52.365
YOU THINK I DID IT FOR ME?

18:52.399 --> 18:54.501
- IF IT GAVE YOU
A SENSE OF PURPOSE,

18:54.534 --> 18:56.169
A WAY TO FEEL GOOD
ABOUT YOURSELF.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.670
- YOU FUCKING LITTLE INGRATE.

18:57.704 --> 18:58.905
- LOOK, THIS IS MY HOUSE.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.307
YOU DON'T TALK TO ME THAT WAY.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.908
- YOUR HOUSE?

19:01.941 --> 19:05.245
AREN'T YOU SUDDENLY HIGH
AND MIGHTY?

19:05.278 --> 19:06.513
I'M NOT EVEN SURPRISED.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.281
YOU KNOW, YOU--YOU TOOK
WHAT YOU NEEDED,

19:08.315 --> 19:10.817
AND THE FIRST CHANCE YOU GOT,
IT WAS "SO LONG, SUCKER!"

19:10.850 --> 19:11.951
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.420
- THE HELL IT ISN'T!

19:13.453 --> 19:17.790
YOU USED ME.
- AND YOU USED ME.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.792
I THINK YOU'D BETTER LEAVE.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.429
- DON'T EVEN BOTHER ASKING.
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:22.462 --> 19:24.397
I'M ALREADY GONE.
- YEAH.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.399
AND DON'T BOTHER COMING BACK
UNTIL YOU SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

19:26.433 --> 19:30.537
- AND DON'T YOU WORRY,
BECAUSE I'M NEVER COMING BACK.

19:30.570 --> 19:34.307
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
IF I EVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.975
OH, EXCUSE ME.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.277
YOU WANT AN APOLOGY?

19:37.310 --> 19:38.945
HERE'S MY APOLOGY:

19:38.978 --> 19:41.681
FUCK YOU, LITTLE BROTHER.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.850
FUCK YOU.

19:43.883 --> 19:47.320
[slams table]

19:47.354 --> 19:50.790
[opens and shuts door]

19:51.858 --> 19:54.827
[house music]

19:54.861 --> 20:02.802
*

20:08.040 --> 20:10.377
- YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM
WITH OUR EXTRACURRICULAR

20:10.410 --> 20:12.445
ONE-FUCK-ONLY POLICY?

20:12.479 --> 20:16.616
- IS IT THAT AFTER A WHILE,
YOU START ASKING YOURSELF...

20:16.649 --> 20:19.386
"AM I DOING THIS
BECAUSE I WANT TO DO IT,

20:19.419 --> 20:22.722
"OR BECAUSE I NEED TO DO IT?

20:22.755 --> 20:25.325
"AND IF I NEED TO DO IT,

20:25.358 --> 20:28.661
"IS IT TO PROVE TO MYSELF
I'M STILL YOUNG AND ATTRACTIVE?

20:28.695 --> 20:32.332
OR 'CAUSE I THINK I'M UNWORTHY
OF BEING LOVED?"

20:32.365 --> 20:37.637
- OR MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I'VE HAD
EVERY FUCKABLE GUY IN THIS CITY.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.875
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

20:42.909 --> 20:45.378
- AH...

20:45.412 --> 20:48.315
THE SCENT OF FRESH MEAT.

20:51.951 --> 20:55.355
THRILL OF THE KILL.
- HEY, TOO BAD, SIMBA.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.356
IT'S ME HE'S CHECKING OUT.

20:56.389 --> 20:57.657
- IN YOUR DREAMS.

20:57.690 --> 21:01.728
- YOU WANT TO BET?

21:01.761 --> 21:04.030
- WHAT ARE THE STAKES?

21:04.063 --> 21:06.366
- IF I WIN,
YOU TAKE ME

21:06.399 --> 21:11.904
ON AN ALL-EXPENSE PAID TRIP
TO "IBEEZA."

21:11.938 --> 21:15.308
- IT'S PRONOUNCED "IBEETHA."

21:15.342 --> 21:18.077
AND IT'S A LONG WAY TO GO
FOR A BATHHOUSE WITH SAND.

21:18.110 --> 21:21.948
- AND IF YOU WIN?
- IF I WIN...

21:21.981 --> 21:23.950
[laughs]
YOU GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.686
- NO FUCKING WAY.

21:26.719 --> 21:29.922
- YOUR CALL.
- NO, WAIT. WAIT.

21:29.956 --> 21:34.927
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY. YOU'RE ON.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.364
'CAUSE I KNOW
HE WAS CHECKING ME OUT.

21:44.837 --> 21:50.710
SHIT.
HE'S GONE.

21:50.743 --> 21:54.313
- HE WHO HESITATES
DOESN'T GET LAID.

21:57.450 --> 22:01.888
- THE MAN IS A PIG,
AN ABSOLUTE PIG.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.691
- AH, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT MEETING YOUR HEROES.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.959
- WHOEVER SAID IT
MUST HAVE MET HIM.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.695
IF I WASN'T ALREADY A DYKE,

22:08.728 --> 22:10.497
HE'D HAVE SENT ME DIVING
FOR THE NEAREST MUFF.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.665
- AND IT'S RIGHT HERE, BABY.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.837
- YOU'D SAY I WAS...

22:17.870 --> 22:18.871
ATTRACTIVE,
WOULDN'T YOU?

22:18.905 --> 22:20.873
- MM, I HAVE TO SHIELD MY EYES

22:20.907 --> 22:22.609
EVERY TIME YOU WALK IN THE ROOM.

22:22.642 --> 22:25.612
HE LOOKED RIGHT THROUGH ME,
AS IF I WAS INVISIBLE.

22:25.645 --> 22:26.879
BUT YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THE WAY

22:26.913 --> 22:28.481
HE WENT
AFTER HIS TRAMP ASSISTANT.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.617
UGH.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.485
- IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE WEARING?

22:32.519 --> 22:34.020
- MM, MY WOOL COAT.

22:34.053 --> 22:37.023
- WHAT WAS THE TRAMP ASSISTANT
WEARING?

22:37.056 --> 22:41.160
- DID YOU EVER HAVE
A DISCO BARBIE?

22:41.193 --> 22:43.996
- YOU THINK I ONLY PLAYED
WITH G.I. JOE?

22:44.030 --> 22:48.735
YES, EVEN I, RAGING BULL, WAS
INDOCTRINATED AT A YOUNG AGE

22:48.768 --> 22:50.670
TO THE STRAIGHT MAN'S IDEAL
OF FEMININE PERFECTION.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.738
- MM. WELL, THAT'S
WHAT SHE WAS WEARING.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.473
- WELL, THERE'S YOUR ANSWER.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.542
- YOU EXPECT ME TO WALK AROUND
IN A SPANDEX DISH TOWEL

22:55.575 --> 22:57.076
AND A COUPLE OF POST-ITS?

22:57.109 --> 22:58.878
- I'M MERELY GIVING YOU
THE SAME ADVICE YOU GAVE ME

22:58.911 --> 23:01.914
WHEN LARRY JACOBS TOOK OVER
THE ARLEN VERSUS ARLEN CASE:

23:01.948 --> 23:05.151
"IT ISN'T RIGHT.
IT ISN'T FAIR. IT JUST IS."

23:05.184 --> 23:08.187
REMIND ME TO KEEP
MY BIG MOUTH SHUT.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.890
- LOOK.
HE'S A MAN, YOU'RE A WOMAN.

23:10.923 --> 23:13.025
GAY, STRAIGHT,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.627
WE ALL HAVE
OUR POWERS OF PERSUASION.

23:14.661 --> 23:15.795
IF YOU WANT
SOMETHING OUT OF HIM,

23:15.828 --> 23:17.630
YOU'VE GOT TO PLAY HIS GAME,

23:17.664 --> 23:19.866
'CAUSE HE SURE AS HELL
ISN'T GOING TO PLAY YOURS.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.070
MMM.

23:27.474 --> 23:30.409
- [sighing]

23:35.482 --> 23:37.083
- SHIT.

23:37.116 --> 23:39.652
- PROBLEM?

23:39.686 --> 23:42.555
- I'M JUST WAITING FOR
AN ANSWER TO AN E-MAIL.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.791
- WELL, IT MUST BE
PRETTY IMPORTANT.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.826
- YEAH, MICHAEL AND I
WROTE KELLER BACK

23:46.859 --> 23:50.463
AND TOLD HIM WE'RE
INTERESTED IN HIS OFFER.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.799
- OH.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.201
WELL, I'M SURE
BIG-TIME DIRECTORS

23:55.234 --> 23:56.803
HAVE HUNDREDS OF CALLS
AND E-MAILS TO ANSWER.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.471
HE'LL GET BACK TO YOU
WHEN HE CAN.

23:58.505 --> 24:00.206
- MMM.

24:00.239 --> 24:03.476
- THAT IS, IF HE'S
STILL INTERESTED.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.612
- WHY WOULDN'T HE BE?

24:05.645 --> 24:07.480
- YOU KNOW HOW IT IS
OUT IN HOLLYWOOD.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.081
THEY'RE HOT ON SOMETHING
ONE MINUTE

24:09.115 --> 24:10.817
AND COLD ON IT THE NEXT.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.252
- I'M SURE HE MEANT IT.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.088
- I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.124
WHAT IF HE TURNS IT
INTO A PIECE OF SHIT?

24:18.157 --> 24:20.560
- WE WON'T LET HIM.

24:20.593 --> 24:23.162
- ONCE YOU SELL IT,
HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS.

24:23.195 --> 24:25.932
MAKE RAGE...
STRAIGHT.

24:28.601 --> 24:32.605
READY FOR LUNCH?

24:32.639 --> 24:34.106
- WE NEED TO GET A LAWYER.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.875
- FOR WHAT?

24:35.908 --> 24:38.110
- KELLER COULD TURN RAGE
INTO A SINGING WARTHOG,

24:38.144 --> 24:41.280
AND THERE'S NOTHING
WE COULD DO ABOUT IT.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.249
- WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN TELLING HIM?

24:43.282 --> 24:45.618
- TO BE CAREFUL,
THAT'S ALL.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.153
- IT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.656
HE TOLD US HE LOVES RAGE
JUST THE WAY HE IS.

24:49.689 --> 24:53.025
- HOW DO WE KNOW HE'S NOT
JUST SAYING THAT?

24:54.561 --> 24:57.163
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BEN.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.731
NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I WOULD APPRECIATE IT

24:58.765 --> 25:00.767
IF YOU WOULD JUST BUTT OUT.

25:03.903 --> 25:06.773
- HAPPY TO.

25:23.790 --> 25:26.525
- THAT LOOKS NICE.

25:28.795 --> 25:31.664
- WELL, WE FAERIES
HAVE A SPECIAL GIFT

25:31.698 --> 25:33.966
FOR RECLAIMING ANYTHING,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.068
NO MATTER HOW COMMON,

25:36.102 --> 25:39.806
AND TRANSFORMING IT INTO
SOMETHING MAGICAL.

25:39.839 --> 25:42.709
WELL, ALMOST ANYTHING.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.711
- I, UH...

25:44.744 --> 25:47.947
BELIEVE THIS IS YOURS.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.982
- I THOUGHT I
RETURNED THAT TO SENDER.

25:50.016 --> 25:51.784
- I KNOW,
I...RETRIEVED IT

25:51.818 --> 25:53.820
FROM THE DEAD LETTER FILE.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.087
- WELL I, UH...

25:55.121 --> 25:57.089
ALREADY TOLD TEDDY
THAT, UM,

25:57.123 --> 25:58.925
I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT
HE'S DOING HIS STEPS

25:58.958 --> 26:01.794
AND WRITING HIS LETTERS,
BUT IT'S ABOUT HIM, NOT ME.

26:01.828 --> 26:03.963
- THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

26:03.996 --> 26:07.199
IT'S ABOUT YOU
HELPING HIM AND, UH...

26:07.233 --> 26:09.368
YOURSELF, TO MOVE ON.

26:09.401 --> 26:12.338
- I HAVE MOVED ON.
THANKS.

26:12.371 --> 26:16.008
AND, UH, SO HAS TED WITHOUT
ANY HELP OR, UH,

26:16.042 --> 26:17.677
OR FORGIVENESS FROM ME.

26:17.710 --> 26:21.347
- HE'S NOT ASKING
FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.215
HE'S ASKING YOU
TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS PAIN

26:23.249 --> 26:25.084
FOR HAVING HURT YOU.

26:25.117 --> 26:29.021
AFTER THAT, IT'S UP TO HIM
TO FORGIVE HIMSELF.

26:56.048 --> 26:58.751
- THAT'S THE EIGHTH ONE
SO FAR TODAY.

26:58.785 --> 27:01.821
IF I'D HAVE KNOWN
WHAT A FLESHPOT THIS WAS,

27:01.854 --> 27:04.791
I WOULD'VE SIGNED UP
YEARS AGO.

27:04.824 --> 27:05.992
NOT THAT I NEED IT.

27:06.025 --> 27:08.627
I HAVE THE PERFECT
TWINK PHYSIQUE.

27:16.969 --> 27:20.673
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU
PUT IT TO USE?

27:31.050 --> 27:33.152
DID YOU JUST START HERE?

27:33.185 --> 27:36.689
- YEAH.
I'M NEW IN TOWN.

27:36.723 --> 27:40.059
- SCORE ONE FOR PITTSBURGH.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.061
MY NAME'S BRIAN.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.897
- SHANE.

27:44.931 --> 27:46.766
- IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO SEE
A FRESH...

27:46.799 --> 27:49.168
FACE.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.302
Justin: OKAY.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.670
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL THEN.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.843
- SHIT. HOLD ON.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.310
COULD YOU ACTUALLY DO
A FAVOR FOR ME?

27:58.344 --> 27:59.846
- YEAH, SURE.

27:59.879 --> 28:02.248
- I KNOW IT'S NOT EVERYBODY
WHO CAN...

28:02.281 --> 28:03.883
SPREAD THEIR LEGS
LIKE THAT.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.788
- I STILL CAN'T GO
AS FAR AS I'D LIKE.

28:08.821 --> 28:12.391
- WELL, I WOULD BE HAPPY
TO HELP STRETCH YOU.

28:12.424 --> 28:18.364
- HEY.
[inaudible whisper]

28:22.835 --> 28:25.404
- IT WAS NICE
TALKING TO YOU.

28:25.437 --> 28:28.007
I GOT TO GO.

28:31.510 --> 28:35.247
- THE MAN THAT
GOT AWAY, HUH?

28:35.281 --> 28:37.950
- AND I WAS HALFWAY
UP HIS ASS.

28:37.984 --> 28:41.220
- HE MUST'VE HEARD
THAT NASTY RUMOR.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.489
YOU KNOW, THE ONE ABOUT YOU
HAVING CRABS.

28:43.522 --> 28:48.394
- AH.
I WONDER HOW THAT HAPPENED.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.763
- PACK THE SUNSCREEN.
WE'RE GOING TO IBIZA.

28:50.797 --> 28:53.432
- AH, I WOULDN'T DITCH
MY TEXTBOOKS YET.

28:59.271 --> 29:02.775
- GOOD NIGHT, GUYS.
- GOOD NIGHT.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.279
- HEY.
- HEY, BUDDY.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.015
- MR. AUERBACH?
- YEAH.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.850
- YOU WANTED A GOOD BAGEL?

29:10.883 --> 29:13.019
HERE'S A GOOD BAGEL.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.520
GO AHEAD, TRY ONE.

29:14.553 --> 29:17.323
HMM, YOU SCREAMED
LOUD ENOUGH FOR THEM.

29:27.199 --> 29:28.567
- THESE FROM NEW YORK?

29:28.600 --> 29:30.069
- TELL JEROME
TO GO TO SOLLY'S.

29:30.102 --> 29:33.539
IT'S THE BEST DELI
IN PITTSBURGH.

29:33.572 --> 29:35.274
BY THE WAY,
I'M LINDSAY PETERSON,

29:35.307 --> 29:36.442
FROM
THE SIDNEY BLOOM GALLERY.

29:36.475 --> 29:38.544
WE MET BRIEFLY
THE OTHER DAY.

29:38.577 --> 29:41.180
- THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.187
WELL, YOU COMING?

30:03.135 --> 30:04.503
- OH!
- OH! OH, OH!

30:04.536 --> 30:05.905
THAT'S OKAY,
SWEETHEART, THAT'S OKAY.

30:05.938 --> 30:06.906
YOU'RE IN THE BEST
OF HANDS.

30:06.939 --> 30:09.441
THERE YOU GO.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.210
[clearing of throat]

30:11.243 --> 30:14.313
- OH.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

30:14.346 --> 30:15.848
- MMM.

30:15.882 --> 30:17.917
- IT'S A WORK OF
MONUMENTAL IMPORTANCE,

30:17.950 --> 30:18.985
RIGHT UP THERE
WITH THE DECO SERIES

30:19.018 --> 30:20.119
AND THE SANTA FE PROJECT.

30:20.152 --> 30:24.056
- DID YOU
BRING THE BAGELS?

30:24.090 --> 30:26.325
- MR. AUERBACH...
- SAM.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.995
- SAM, I WISH
YOU WOULD RECONSIDER

30:29.028 --> 30:31.130
ALLOWING US TO DO A SHOW THAT
WOULD TRACE THIS MURAL

30:31.163 --> 30:33.465
FROM COMMISSION
TO CONCEPT TO EXECUTION.

30:33.499 --> 30:34.600
USING YOUR SKETCHES AND NOTES,
WE COULD...

30:34.633 --> 30:38.337
- GIVE ME A HAND,
WOULD YOU?

30:38.370 --> 30:41.473
- ME?
- TAKE THIS BRUSH.

30:41.507 --> 30:44.210
SOME RIATA RED NUMBER 9.
- HMM? MM-HM.

30:44.243 --> 30:45.411
- DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY COME UP
WITH THESE CRAZY NAMES.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.213
- [uneasy chuckle]
- [chuckling]

30:47.246 --> 30:50.216
NICE EVEN STROKES,
ALL RIGHT?

30:50.249 --> 30:52.151
THAT'S IT.
- OH...

30:52.184 --> 30:53.485
- YEAH,
THAT'S THE WAY, YEAH.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.087
KEEP MOVING IT.
- OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE

30:55.121 --> 30:56.956
I'M ACTUALLY PAINTING
WITH SAM AUERBACH.

30:56.989 --> 30:58.290
- KEEP STROKING.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.631
- W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:05.664 --> 31:08.634
- I TOLD YOU,
KEEP STROKING.

31:08.667 --> 31:11.537
- UM...OH!
OH, MY GOD.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.506
OH, MY GOD,
I'M SO SORRY, I'M...

31:14.540 --> 31:18.244
I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW,
I'M...I'M HAPPILY MARRIED.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.679
- YEAH.
WHO'S THE LUCKY GUY?

31:20.712 --> 31:23.249
- HE'S NOT A GUY.
HE'S A WOMAN.

31:23.282 --> 31:26.518
- ALL THE BETTER.
CALL HER.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.687
WE'LL HAVE A THREE-WAY.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.424
OH! OH! OH! OH!
- [gasps] OH, MY GOD!

31:32.458 --> 31:35.394
- [grunts]

31:35.427 --> 31:37.129
OW, MY NOSE!

31:37.163 --> 31:39.431
[groaning]
- YOU'RE BLEEDING.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.067
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S JUST...

31:41.100 --> 31:43.002
JUST A LITTLE RIATA RED
NUMBER 9.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.004
OH, YOU REALLY
MUST BE A DYKE

31:45.037 --> 31:47.206
WITH A RIGHT HOOK
LIKE THAT.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.575
- YOU ARE THE MOST REPELLENT MAN
I'VE EVER MET,

31:49.608 --> 31:52.611
EVEN IF YOU ARE A GENIUS.

31:52.644 --> 31:55.681
- HEY.

31:55.714 --> 31:57.349
WHAT DID YOU SAY THE NAME OF
THAT DELI IS AGAIN?

32:06.592 --> 32:08.194
[exhales]

32:09.728 --> 32:12.631
- VIC'S POTS AND PANS HAVE
MOVED MORE THAN I HAVE.

32:12.664 --> 32:15.367
FIRST TO TED'S,
THEN TO YOUR MOM'S, NOW HERE.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.503
- SHE SAID SHE WANTED ALL
OF IT OUT OF THE HOUSE

32:17.536 --> 32:19.105
BEFORE SHE COULD
COUNT TO 10.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.740
"AND THAT INCLUDES
EVERY FUCKING TEASPOON."

32:21.773 --> 32:24.110
- IT'S SCARY,
HOW WELL YOU DO HER.

32:24.143 --> 32:26.445
[knocking on window]

32:26.478 --> 32:28.514
- I JUST WISH THEY'D KISS
AND MAKE UP ALREADY.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.449
- UH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

32:30.482 --> 32:34.020
THERE'S NOTHING MORE TEDIOUS
THAN THOSE INTERMINABLE FEUDS.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.491
[knocking]

32:40.526 --> 32:42.494
[keys jangling]

32:46.098 --> 32:47.066
[TV playing quietly]

32:47.099 --> 32:48.067
[door closes]

32:48.100 --> 32:50.036
- UNCLE VIC?

32:54.406 --> 32:57.109
[creaking of floorboards]

32:57.143 --> 33:00.512
- [whispering] SO, WHAT
SHOULD WE DO WITH THIS?

33:00.546 --> 33:02.214
- WELL, I'D PUT IT AWAY,

33:02.248 --> 33:03.649
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE WANTS IT.

33:03.682 --> 33:06.985
- THEN I GUESS WE'D BETTER
WAKE HIM UP AND ASK HIM.

33:10.156 --> 33:13.259
- UNCLE VIC,
YOUR MOVERS ARE HERE.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.361
- WITH EVERYTHING FROM DEBBIE'S
KITCHEN EXCEPT THE SINK.

33:15.394 --> 33:16.662
[chuckling]

33:21.467 --> 33:23.602
- UNCLE VIC?

33:25.271 --> 33:27.406

NO VEGETABLES,

33:44.156 --> 33:45.324
BUT I CHANGED THAT FOR YOU,
SWEETHEART,

33:45.357 --> 33:47.293
SO EAT ALL YOUR BROCCOLI.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.664
WHERE THE HELL
IS THE POT PIE?

33:52.698 --> 33:54.266
DID YOU HAVE TO GO KILL
A CHICKEN?

33:54.300 --> 33:56.168
- MA?
Cook: IT'S COMING. IT'S COMING.

33:56.202 --> 33:58.837
- I CAN'T TALK TO YOU NOW,
MICHAEL.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.439
- IT'S IMPORTANT.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.274
- CAN'T YOU SEE MY HANDS
ARE FULL? ALL RIGHT?

34:02.308 --> 34:03.675
BETTY'S OUT SICK,
I'M WORKING TWO STATIONS.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.277
- MA, PLEASE.

34:05.311 --> 34:06.578
- HERE YOU GO, HONEY.
SORRY.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.414
Man: I NEED THE CHECK,
PLEASE.

34:08.447 --> 34:09.815
- I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.
- DEB, THE POT PIE'S UP.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.450
- GROWLING FOR MEAT TODAY.

34:11.483 --> 34:15.687
- MA, WILL YOU PUT
THE GODDAMN TRAY DOWN?

34:15.721 --> 34:18.090
- WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT
THAT IT CAN'T WAIT?

34:18.124 --> 34:20.159
- COME SIT DOWN.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.293
- I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO SIT DOWN, MICHAEL.

34:21.327 --> 34:24.596
JUST TELL ME. WHAT?

34:24.630 --> 34:27.566
- IT'S UNCLE VIC.
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

34:27.599 --> 34:28.734
DID HE HAVE A SHIT FIT
WHEN YOU SHOWED UP

34:28.767 --> 34:31.203
WITH ALL THOSE POTS
AND PANS?

34:31.237 --> 34:32.704
WELL, I HOPE SO,
THAT SON OF A BITCH.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.706
- MA...

34:34.740 --> 34:36.242
Debbie: WHAT?

34:36.275 --> 34:38.710
Man: IS BETTY
NOT WORKING TODAY?

34:38.744 --> 34:41.347
- UNCLE VIC IS GONE.

34:45.517 --> 34:48.520
HE PASSED AWAY.

34:50.222 --> 34:52.658
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

34:54.293 --> 34:57.629
- WE TOOK THE STUFF
OVER TO HIM.

34:57.663 --> 34:59.631
HE WAS THERE...

35:01.233 --> 35:04.236
IN FRONT OF THE TV.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.652
I'M SORRY, MOM.

35:24.556 --> 35:27.226
I CALLED RODNEY.

35:27.259 --> 35:30.562
AND THE PARAMEDICS CAME,
BUT...

35:41.473 --> 35:44.210
- [moans]

35:49.448 --> 35:50.816
I'VE GOTTA GET MY FOOD.

35:50.849 --> 35:54.286
- IT'S OKAY, MA.
IT'LL WAIT.

35:59.991 --> 36:04.330
[overlapping chatter]

36:04.363 --> 36:08.267
[football game playing
in background]

36:08.300 --> 36:10.402
[laughter]

36:10.436 --> 36:14.373
[overlapping chatter]

36:25.984 --> 36:27.886
- YOU INTO FOOTBALL?

36:27.919 --> 36:30.289
- I HATE FOOTBALL.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.558
- THEN WHY ARE YOU
WATCHING IT?

36:32.591 --> 36:34.426
- SO SOME HOT GUY
WILL COME OVER

36:34.460 --> 36:38.697
AND ASK ME
IF I'M INTO FOOTBALL.

36:38.730 --> 36:39.998
- I'M JUSTIN.

36:40.031 --> 36:43.369
- SHANE.

36:43.402 --> 36:45.971
- I SAW YOU AT BABYLON
THE OTHER NIGHT.

36:46.004 --> 36:48.374
- OH?
- YEAH.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.376
YOU WERE CRUISING
THE HELL OUT OF ME,

36:50.409 --> 36:52.444
AND THEN
YOU JUST DISAPPEARED.

36:52.478 --> 36:53.845
- UM...
ONE OF THOSE EMERGENCIES.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.748
COULDN'T BE HELPED.

36:56.782 --> 37:00.252
- WELL, LUCKY FOR US,
I FOUND YOU AGAIN.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.922
- YOU PITTSBURGH GUYS
SURE ARE FRIENDLY.

37:03.955 --> 37:05.591
- [chuckles]

37:05.624 --> 37:08.327
IT'S A SMALL TOWN
WITH A BIG HEART.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.929
YOU'VE BEEN HERE LONG?
- ALL OF A WEEK.

37:10.962 --> 37:13.432
STILL LIVING OUT OF BOXES.

37:16.535 --> 37:20.639
- WHY DON'T I HELP YOU
UNPACK?

37:20.672 --> 37:22.941
- WHY DON'T YOU?

37:25.911 --> 37:27.913
Brian: HOLD IT.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.549
- SAY, AREN'T YOU
THE GUY FROM THE GYM?

37:30.582 --> 37:32.284
- YEAH, THE ONE WITH
THE BAD CASE OF CRABS.

37:32.318 --> 37:34.353
FORTUNATELY,
THAT'S CLEARED UP.

37:34.386 --> 37:36.888
- YOU'RE TOO LATE.
I WON.

37:36.922 --> 37:38.524
YOU CAN BOOK OUR FLIGHT
TOMORROW.

37:38.557 --> 37:41.927
- NOBODY'S GOING ANYWHERE.
BET'S OFF.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.496
[clearing of throat]

37:44.530 --> 37:47.499
VIC'S DEAD.

37:47.533 --> 37:48.834
- OH...

37:48.867 --> 37:50.902
THAT IS REALLY LOW,
EVEN FOR YOU.

37:50.936 --> 37:53.672
- IT'S TRUE.

37:59.811 --> 38:03.281
MA, YOU WANT TO GO
UPSTAIRS AND LIE DOWN?

38:04.483 --> 38:06.318
MA?

38:07.419 --> 38:10.389
- CAN I GET ANYONE ANYTHING?

38:10.422 --> 38:12.290
HOW ABOUT SOME TEA, DEB?

38:15.427 --> 38:18.096
RODNEY?

38:18.129 --> 38:19.831
- NO, THANKS.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.471
[opening of door]

38:27.873 --> 38:31.076
- DEB, I'M SO SORRY.

38:31.109 --> 38:33.812
- THANK YOU, SUNSHINE.

38:33.845 --> 38:36.047
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

38:38.717 --> 38:41.620
- WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?

38:41.653 --> 38:44.823
Ben: UH, HIS HEART.

38:44.856 --> 38:47.493
THE DOCTOR SAID HIS
CHOLESTEROL WAS SKY-HIGH

38:47.526 --> 38:49.495
FROM THE MEDS HE WAS TAKING.

38:49.528 --> 38:50.762
- NO WARNING.
NOTHING.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.464
Hunter: I THOUGHT THE MEDS

38:52.498 --> 38:54.500
WERE SUPPOSED TO
KEEP YOU ALIVE,

38:54.533 --> 38:56.134
NOT KILL YOU.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.404
- IT DOESN'T ALWAYS
WORK THAT WAY.

39:06.144 --> 39:09.347
- I THOUGHT WE'D HAVE
MORE TIME THAN THIS.

39:12.618 --> 39:16.522
- YOU GUYS SHOULD'VE BEEN
TOGETHER A LOT LONGER.

39:16.555 --> 39:19.057
IT'S TRAGIC.

39:20.692 --> 39:23.595
- HAMLET'S TRAGIC.

39:23.629 --> 39:25.664
PLATFORM SHOES ARE TRAGIC.

39:29.768 --> 39:32.070
VIC WAS ON HIS DEATHBED
FOUR YEARS AGO.

39:34.640 --> 39:37.976
ALL THIS WAS GRAVY.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.713
HE KNEW THAT.

39:43.181 --> 39:45.050
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

39:45.083 --> 39:46.852
- GOING THIS WAY.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.589
COULD'VE BEEN A LOT WORSE.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.460
IF YOU ASK ME,
HE WAS FUCKING LUCKY.

39:55.661 --> 39:56.895
- [grunts]

39:56.928 --> 40:00.432
NOBODY FUCKING ASKED YOU.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.167
AND WHO THE FUCK
ARE YOU TO DECIDE

40:02.200 --> 40:05.471
HOW LONG
HE SHOULD'VE LIVED?

40:07.105 --> 40:10.408
- I KNOW.
THE TRUTH HURTS.

40:16.948 --> 40:19.818
- GET THIS SHITHEAD
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

40:30.696 --> 40:35.000
- BRIAN, WAIT UP.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.234
SHE'S UPSET.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.969
JUST TELL HER
YOU'RE SORRY.

40:38.003 --> 40:41.206
- THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM--
I'M NOT.

40:41.239 --> 40:42.741
- WE JUST HEARD.
- HOW'S DEBBIE?

40:42.774 --> 40:45.076
- NOTHING CAN KEEP
A GOOD WOMAN DOWN.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.578
- WHAT, ARE YOU LEAVING?

40:46.612 --> 40:47.946
- THEY RAN OUT OF ICE.

40:47.979 --> 40:50.549
Lindsay: BRIAN?
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

40:50.582 --> 40:53.084
- JUST GO BACK IN.
WE'LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE.

40:53.118 --> 40:55.086
- NOT ME.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.222
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

40:57.255 --> 40:59.958
- WE HAVE A BET,
REMEMBER?

40:59.991 --> 41:01.727
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT SEX

41:01.760 --> 41:03.829
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.831
- "AT A TIME LIKE THIS"
IS EXACTLY WHEN YOU SHOULD

41:05.864 --> 41:08.867
BE THINKING ABOUT IT--
BEFORE YOU CAN'T.

41:27.753 --> 41:29.655
- HERE YOU ARE.

41:31.056 --> 41:34.025
- JUST TAKING A BREATHER.

41:34.059 --> 41:36.027
- HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

41:37.763 --> 41:40.632
- I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT ME
RIGHT NOW.

41:40.666 --> 41:43.001
I DON'T THINK MA KNOWS
WHAT HIT HER.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.603
- YEAH.

41:44.636 --> 41:47.138
WHAT BRIAN SAID
SURE DIDN'T HELP.

41:47.172 --> 41:50.008
INSENSITIVE PRICK.

41:50.041 --> 41:52.143
- WELL,
THE FUNNY THING IS,

41:52.177 --> 41:57.015
VIC WOULD PROBABLY
HAVE AGREED WITH HIM.

41:57.048 --> 42:00.151
WHEN HE CAME BACK,
EVERYBODY THOUGHT

42:00.185 --> 42:04.823
HE HAD A COUPLE MONTHS
TO LIVE, TOPS.

42:04.856 --> 42:08.026
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN
WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE.

42:08.059 --> 42:10.762
- NOT A PRETTY PICTURE,
I'M SURE.

42:10.796 --> 42:15.066
- SO, WHATEVER TIME HE GOT
WAS A GIFT.

42:16.602 --> 42:20.038
HE WAS A LOT LUCKIER
THAN MOST.

42:20.071 --> 42:23.041
- THAT MAY BE TRUE, BUT...

42:23.074 --> 42:25.644
IT WASN'T BRIAN'S PLACE TO
SHRUG OFF HIS DEATH,

42:25.677 --> 42:26.912
ESPECIALLY TO YOUR MOM.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.647
- HE SHRUGS EVERYTHING OFF.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.048
IT'S WHO HE IS.

42:30.081 --> 42:31.650
- AND YOU DEFEND HIM.
IT'S WHO YOU ARE.

42:31.683 --> 42:33.585
- LOOK, I DON'T NEED
TO BE TOLD

42:33.619 --> 42:36.688
HOW TO RESPOND
OR WHAT TO FEEL.

42:36.722 --> 42:38.189
CERTAINLY NOT BY YOU.

42:38.223 --> 42:40.859
SO...IF THAT'S WHY
YOU CAME UP HERE, THEN...

42:40.892 --> 42:42.227
- IT'S NOT.

42:45.030 --> 42:49.801
I CAME TO OFFER MY
UNCONDITIONAL LOVE AND SUPPORT,

42:49.835 --> 42:53.872
AND TO LET YOU KNOW,
IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO...

42:53.905 --> 42:55.206
- THERE IS.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.843
YOU CAN PUT
EVERYTHING ELSE ASIDE,

42:57.876 --> 43:00.245
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, I DON'T
GIVE A SHIT ABOUT...

43:00.278 --> 43:04.215
THAT DIRECTOR,
WHATEVER HIS NAME IS.

43:04.249 --> 43:08.720
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS HELPING
MY MOM GET THROUGH THIS.

43:12.758 --> 43:15.727
I JUST HOPE I CAN.

43:19.064 --> 43:22.000
[knocking on door]

43:23.268 --> 43:25.270
- [exhales]

43:27.773 --> 43:29.908
[knocking on door]

43:37.683 --> 43:38.850
- DID I WAKE YOU?

43:38.884 --> 43:39.918
- UH, NO.

43:39.951 --> 43:42.120
[clearing of throat]
NO.

43:42.153 --> 43:44.322
COME ON IN.

43:48.426 --> 43:52.297
OKAY, YOU SHOULD KNOW, FIRST
OFF, I-I NEVER WEAR THIS,

43:52.330 --> 43:55.400
BUT, UH, TOMORROW'S LAUNDRY
DAY, SO, UH...

43:55.433 --> 43:58.870
- IT'S OKAY.
YOU LOOK STUNNING.

43:58.904 --> 44:01.006
- YEAH.

44:01.039 --> 44:02.774
SO YOU, UH...
[clearing of throat]

44:02.808 --> 44:05.143
JUST COME FROM A MEETING?

44:05.176 --> 44:07.012
- I DID.
- MM-HM.

44:07.045 --> 44:10.015
AND WHO DID YOU
RESCUE TONIGHT?

44:10.048 --> 44:12.083
- ACTUALLY, UM...

44:12.117 --> 44:14.085
ME.

44:14.119 --> 44:16.221
[exhales]

44:16.254 --> 44:19.157
IT WAS MY TURN TO SPEAK
AND, UH...

44:19.190 --> 44:21.292
BASICALLY,
WHAT I SAID WAS,

44:21.326 --> 44:23.361
EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN CLEAN
FOR OVER TWO YEARS

44:23.394 --> 44:25.897
AND FOLLOWED THE PROGRAMS,
TRIED TO BE A...

44:25.931 --> 44:27.032
A GOOD COUNSELOR...

44:27.065 --> 44:28.166
- BETTER THAN GOOD.

44:28.199 --> 44:30.001
THE BEST.

44:33.071 --> 44:35.040
- I STILL FEEL AS THOUGH
I'VE FAILED.

44:35.073 --> 44:39.444
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- I-IT IS TRUE. I...

44:39.477 --> 44:41.246
I FAILED
TO MAKE PROPER AMENDS

44:41.279 --> 44:43.381
TO THE ONE PERSON THAT I
SHOULD'VE MADE THEM TO

44:43.414 --> 44:46.785
A LONG TIME AGO.

44:46.818 --> 44:48.486
- WELL, IF YOU'D LIKE TO
WRITE A LETTER,

44:48.519 --> 44:50.321
I HAVE PLENTY OF STATIONERY.

44:50.355 --> 44:52.891
- I DON'T WANT TO
WRITE A LETTER.

44:57.362 --> 44:59.931
WHAT I WANT TO DO...

44:59.965 --> 45:02.033
IS THIS.

45:34.900 --> 45:38.169
- YOU KNOW,
MAYBE I SHOULD STAY.

45:38.203 --> 45:40.972
- NO, NO. YOU GO HOME
WITH HUNTER AND BEN.

45:41.006 --> 45:45.310
GET SOME REST. I'M HERE.
DON'T WORRY.

45:45.343 --> 45:47.145
- BYE.

45:51.316 --> 45:53.284
- BYE.

45:58.957 --> 46:01.326
- BYE.

46:21.579 --> 46:24.182
[knocks on door]

46:27.318 --> 46:29.154
- EVERYBODY'S GONE.

46:29.187 --> 46:31.022
- THANK GOD.

46:31.056 --> 46:35.360
I COULDN'T HANDLE ONE MORE HUG
OR TEARY GOOD-BYE.

46:35.393 --> 46:37.128
- THEY UNDERSTAND.

46:38.997 --> 46:42.100
BROUGHT YOU MY AUNT LULAH'S
SECRET SLEEP POTION,

46:42.133 --> 46:44.102
WARM MILK AND HONEY.

46:44.135 --> 46:46.237
GUARANTEED TO
SOOTHE THE NERVES

46:46.271 --> 46:48.840
AND SEND YOU OFF
TO DREAMLAND.

46:48.874 --> 46:52.810
[chuckles]
WELL, THAT AND HALF A XANAX.

46:55.280 --> 46:57.582
- KEEP THE PILL.

46:57.615 --> 46:59.951
- SURE?

46:59.985 --> 47:03.054
IT'LL HELP CALM YOU.

47:03.088 --> 47:05.390
- CALM ME?

47:08.960 --> 47:11.897
HOW CAN I BE CALM...

47:13.098 --> 47:15.967
AFTER THE WAY
I TALKED TO HIM?

47:18.236 --> 47:22.140
I SAID I DIDN'T CARE IF
I EVER SAW HIM AGAIN.

47:28.379 --> 47:31.316
MY LAST WORDS TO HIM...

47:33.551 --> 47:36.054
WERE "FUCK YOU."

47:38.656 --> 47:41.226
- YOU TWO
WERE ALWAYS FIGHTING.

47:41.259 --> 47:43.528
- AND WE ALWAYS MADE UP.

47:51.002 --> 47:53.271
BUT NOT THIS TIME.

48:20.198 --> 48:22.167
- [exhales]

50:09.607 --> 50:12.577
- LIKE THAT?

50:12.610 --> 50:14.279
- YEAH.

50:14.312 --> 50:18.149
I ALWAYS LIKE
WINNING A BET.

50:18.183 --> 50:20.551
- YOU'VE GOT A GREAT COCK.

50:20.585 --> 50:24.389
- IT'S THE FIRST TIME ANYONE
HAS EVER SAID THAT TO ME.

50:24.422 --> 50:26.124
THANKS.

50:26.157 --> 50:27.392
- ALTHOUGH
THERE IS SOMETHING

50:27.425 --> 50:28.693
I'D LIKE TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

50:28.726 --> 50:29.694
WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE ME A CALL?

50:29.727 --> 50:31.129
- HMM.

50:31.162 --> 50:33.398
SORRY, I...
DON'T DO ENCORES.

50:33.431 --> 50:35.166
- I'M A DOCTOR.

50:39.337 --> 50:40.471
- WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

50:40.505 --> 50:43.541
GET PAID TO PROBE
MY PROSTATE?

50:43.574 --> 50:45.210
- I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW

50:45.243 --> 50:47.245
YOU'VE GOT A LUMP
ON YOUR LEFT TESTICLE.

50:50.481 --> 50:53.751
IF I WERE YOU, I'D HAVE IT
CHECKED OUT.

50:53.784 --> 50:56.621
THE SOONER THE BETTER.
