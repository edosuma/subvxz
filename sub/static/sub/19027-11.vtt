our lives and then just put it on TV.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.210
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

11:58.250 --> 12:02.516
<i>[J.D.] Carla listened at the door while</i>
<i>I was helped Turk ask for gym equipment.</i>

12:03.289 --> 12:06.258
- What do you want?
<i>- [J.D.] And then Turk lied.</i>

12:06.358 --> 12:09.919
Sir, we're here on behalf
of Dr. Bianca.

12:10.596 --> 12:13.429
You know, the albino radiologist?

12:13.499 --> 12:15.729
Oh, Jim!

12:15.801 --> 12:17.564
Who'd he get pregnant this time?

12:17.636 --> 12:22.005
I tell you, the ladies cannot
resist that ivory rascal.

12:22.074 --> 12:26.841
Sir, Jim is demanding that he
gets new equipment in his lab.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.846
Demanding?

12:30.316 --> 12:35.879
There is no way in hell
that Jim is getting new equipment!

12:37.757 --> 12:41.215
Sorry, baby. I tried.

12:49.468 --> 12:52.562
- Has there been any change?
- She's still the same.

12:52.638 --> 12:56.540
<i>[J.D.] I guess in the back of my mind</i>
<i>I was hoping for a pleasant surprise</i>

12:56.609 --> 12:59.169
<i>because around here</i>
<i>most of them are unpleasant.</i>

12:59.278 --> 13:01.542
[Sighs]

13:01.614 --> 13:04.777
<i>Like when a guy you thought</i>
<i>you connected with turns on you.</i>

13:04.850 --> 13:07.819
Hey. How's the day
treating you, big guy?

13:08.254 --> 13:10.415
You're not talking to me,
are you, Doogie?

13:10.489 --> 13:11.547
Doogie?

13:11.624 --> 13:15.492
This is a doctor no-fly zone, bubs.
Speaking of flys, yours is down.

13:16.896 --> 13:20.024
Oh, no!
You fell for the grade school zinger!

13:20.099 --> 13:22.761
You gotta go!
Back to the game, boys.

13:25.905 --> 13:30.274
And you guys would not believe
how hard my man fought for us.

13:30.342 --> 13:35.109
Yeah. Well, you know, ladies,
I do what I do when I do what I do.

13:35.214 --> 13:37.444
<i>[J.D.] Or your boss blows your cover.</i>

13:37.516 --> 13:40.007
Turkelton,
I have reconsidered your request

13:40.085 --> 13:44.545
and I've decided to give old Jim
that new MRI machine.

13:44.623 --> 13:46.750
[Yelps] See, baby... No! Wait!

13:46.826 --> 13:49.192
<i>[J.D.] My surprise</i>
<i>came the next morning</i>

13:49.295 --> 13:52.628
<i>when I found out Elliot</i>
<i>had broken our no booty call agreement.</i>

13:54.934 --> 13:56.993
<i>With my nemesis.</i>

14:00.105 --> 14:02.039
Why is he wearing my robe?

14:02.541 --> 14:04.065
It fits me.

14:09.081 --> 14:13.040
- J.D., I can explain.
- Oh, you did it twice.

14:13.118 --> 14:16.679
All righty. Somebody's a stud.
We got a stud alert in here!

14:16.755 --> 14:19.121
Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!

14:20.593 --> 14:25.496
OK, this is just mathematically
impossible.

14:25.564 --> 14:28.465
Keith, Dr. Dorian and I
have to get to work now, OK?

14:28.534 --> 14:31.298
Why don't you clean this up,
then drop off my laundry

14:31.370 --> 14:34.737
and get me a coffee and bring it
to the hospital. Run, like a bunny.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.603
Sure thing, Elliot.

14:36.675 --> 14:40.577
Keith! It's after nine.
It's Dr. Reid now.

14:40.846 --> 14:42.746
Dr. Reid. Dr. Reid.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.511
I love booty calls.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.485
"El Toro Grande"?

14:48.554 --> 14:50.988
I'm not familiar with this brand.

14:54.793 --> 14:59.423
No change.
Her FIO2 is still 50 percent.

15:00.199 --> 15:01.359
I said no cream.

15:01.433 --> 15:05.199
I didn't say no cream.
It's like having a sex puppy.

15:05.638 --> 15:09.130
- What's your problem?
- I can't stand that guy.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.301
J.D., he's just a booty call.

15:11.377 --> 15:15.404
- Say the word and I'll end it.
- I'd appreciate it if you'd end it.

15:16.015 --> 15:19.314
Oh, my God. You've turned Keith
into forbidden fruit.

15:20.185 --> 15:22.483
I must have him now.

15:22.554 --> 15:25.114
Heel! [clicking tongue]

15:26.325 --> 15:29.351
Oh. Hey, bud.
Check out my new mop bling.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.918
Bling!

15:30.996 --> 15:32.361
It's cool. I cleaned it.

15:32.464 --> 15:34.625
Oh, so what?
Now we're pals again?

15:34.733 --> 15:37.497
I've got to be honest.
I'm confused, Sasquatch.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.628
I got a rep to protect, OK?

15:39.705 --> 15:41.730
I'm seen as the king of working folks.

15:41.807 --> 15:44.469
If they catch me hobnobbing
with a doctor-type,

15:44.543 --> 15:48.001
I won't get my cut of prosthetics
we looted from the storage room.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.413
- How's that?
- We sell feet to college kids for $500.

15:51.483 --> 15:54.816
Apparently, they...
smoke something out of them.

15:54.887 --> 15:58.254
Let me get this straight.
You are embarrassed to be seen with me?

15:58.357 --> 15:59.483
At the hospital.

15:59.558 --> 16:01.788
At the bar we can hang out all we want.

16:02.061 --> 16:05.622
You rich, yacht-owning punk!
You think...

16:05.731 --> 16:08.291
They're gone. It's cool.
See you at the bar.

16:10.502 --> 16:12.265
Aw, sweetie,

16:12.338 --> 16:17.105
do you want me to call his mommy
and tell her he's being mean to you?

16:17.176 --> 16:20.145
My friend is mean to me.

16:22.214 --> 16:24.512
Listen. Honey, I know you're angry.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.051
But look what I found in my locker.
A wad of cash.

16:27.119 --> 16:29.178
You can buy the shoes you wanted.

16:29.254 --> 16:32.917
I'm not mad about that gym thing.
Sign this please.

16:34.693 --> 16:37.253
- Any of you ladies have a pen?
- Whoo!

16:37.663 --> 16:39.426
Oh! Yow!

16:39.498 --> 16:41.728
- Yow!
- [Sighs]

16:41.800 --> 16:43.825
You set me up.

16:43.902 --> 16:44.869
Baby, you are mad.

16:44.970 --> 16:48.701
It's not a crime for me to want one
place that I can hang out by myself.

16:48.774 --> 16:51.709
Turk, I am not mad, OK?

16:51.777 --> 16:53.938
Now staple these, please.

16:56.081 --> 16:58.208
Anybody got a stapler?

16:58.884 --> 17:00.249
Hey!

17:01.020 --> 17:02.453
Hey.

17:04.022 --> 17:07.584
<i>[J.D.] I promised I wouldn't pick</i>
<i>on Keith, but this one he had coming.</i>

17:07.659 --> 17:10.627
OK, guys.
Gather round, gather round.

17:10.729 --> 17:12.788
Your hero, Keith here,

17:12.865 --> 17:15.698
forgot to check the blood levels
on Mr. Joy this morning

17:15.768 --> 17:16.826
and guess what?

17:18.237 --> 17:19.464
He's dead.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.597
Way to go there, Keith.

17:21.673 --> 17:23.573
I've never seen this guy before.

17:23.642 --> 17:26.941
Oh! Way to get to know
your patients there, murderer.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.139
There's Mr. Joy.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.478
J.D., did you steal him from the morgue?

17:31.550 --> 17:34.917
I left a note on the decapitated guy's
stump I'd have him back by 2.

17:35.020 --> 17:36.248
It is 1:45.

17:36.321 --> 17:39.848
I have to take him back to the basement
and I don't even have my gurney.

17:39.925 --> 17:41.825
I hate dead people.

17:42.494 --> 17:46.328
All right. The real reason
that I brought Mr. Joy up here

17:46.398 --> 17:48.662
was for a teaching exercise.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.760
Can anyone figure out
the cause of death?

17:51.837 --> 17:54.169
Maybe when you leaned over
to check his I.V.,

17:54.239 --> 17:57.333
you smothered him to death
with one of your love handles.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.205
What did you say, Keith?

18:00.279 --> 18:04.113
Dr. Reid told me if you picked on me
I should stand up for myself.

18:04.183 --> 18:08.017
And that you're very sensitive
about your... doughy physique.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.816
Well, I'm not.

18:15.060 --> 18:19.156
Please, no one help.
He's not heavy at all.

18:19.231 --> 18:21.597
Out of professional decorum

18:21.700 --> 18:25.431
we should refrain
from talking about Dr. Reid.

18:25.504 --> 18:29.201
He's boinking her, everyone.
That's why he gets special treatment.

18:30.342 --> 18:32.572
What did she say to do
if I said that?

18:32.644 --> 18:34.703
- Page her.
- Ah!

18:34.780 --> 18:36.680
- Hello.
- [Gagging]

18:37.049 --> 18:40.815
I forgot how strong you are
when you're mad.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.017
Hey, can I...
can I talk to you for a sec?

18:48.093 --> 18:51.654
What's the matter, Sally?
Vending machine's out of bras again?

18:51.763 --> 18:53.458
Nice. You tell him.

18:53.532 --> 18:54.658
What's up, buddy?

18:54.733 --> 18:58.294
I just thought your friends might
be interested in seeing this photo

18:58.370 --> 19:01.339
I took with my cell phone
the other night.

19:02.441 --> 19:05.808
I'm going to airbrush
"Friends Forever."

19:05.878 --> 19:08.938
Then I'm gonna hang these bad boys
all over the hospital.

19:09.014 --> 19:10.982
Oh, evocative.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.449
- Give it to me.
- You want it? Come and get it.

19:13.519 --> 19:15.453
- Come and get it.
- Gentlemen,

19:15.521 --> 19:17.989
let's try to be professional.

19:19.525 --> 19:22.289
I left my gurney downstairs
in the morgue.

19:22.361 --> 19:24.295
You're a superstar.

19:25.397 --> 19:27.558
One of them staplers
could've killed me.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.965
Know what bothers me?
You whining about me being in your space

19:31.036 --> 19:32.901
when you never want to be alone.

19:32.971 --> 19:35.531
For God's sake,
you bought side-by-side toilets.

19:35.641 --> 19:38.940
- That was a surprise for your birthday.
- A surprise for me.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.310
- Surprise! How about that? OK?
- I don't want it. Take it back.

19:44.116 --> 19:46.641
Doughy physique, Elliot?
Doughy physique?

19:46.718 --> 19:48.948
If the pear-shaped shirt fits, wear it.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.318
I am ashamed of you, OK?

19:50.389 --> 19:53.358
Do you know how petty it is
to get that personal?

19:53.458 --> 19:56.393
- My own face, OK?
- That's what I'm telling you.

19:56.461 --> 19:59.726
Once when we were dating,
Elliot asked me to urinate on her.

19:59.798 --> 20:01.163
[All stop arguing]

20:03.435 --> 20:05.801
I had been stung by a jellyfish!

20:07.005 --> 20:09.337
[All arguing]

20:11.743 --> 20:14.405
<i>[Pagers beeping]</i>

20:15.347 --> 20:18.783
<i>[J.D.] Around here, it can feel</i>
<i>like good things never happen.</i>

20:23.622 --> 20:25.749
Good to see you, you old bird.

20:26.491 --> 20:28.356
Did I miss anything?

20:29.127 --> 20:31.493
I'll catch you up later.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.258
<i>[J.D.] Of course, when they do,</i>

20:33.332 --> 20:36.358
<i>all the petty little arguments</i>
<i>fade away.</i>

20:39.371 --> 20:42.898
<i>And you don't mind waiting</i>
<i>a little longer for your workout.</i>

20:44.176 --> 20:48.306
<i>Or your bar friend</i>
<i>not being your work friend.</i>

20:48.380 --> 20:51.406
<i>Because the truth is,</i>
<i>when you put stuff in perspective,</i>

20:51.483 --> 20:53.849
<i>the little things</i>
<i>will never bother you again.</i>

20:53.952 --> 20:55.579
Good morning, Dr. D.

20:55.654 --> 20:59.385
Dr. Reid told me to get my sweet ass
out of the shower and make an omelet.

20:59.458 --> 21:00.425
You want one?

21:00.525 --> 21:02.959
<i>[J.D.] Did I say never?</i>
