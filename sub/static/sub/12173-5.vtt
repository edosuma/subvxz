but you will also be able
to see into the future.

11:35.080 --> 11:39.324
Now I know this, right, because he
made this pair here for me.

11:41.440 --> 11:44.364
So you don't have to worry
about telling me what this is all about

11:44.440 --> 11:47.887

Well, then go and marry her

You go to the Garrison.

Drink whisky. Have a laugh.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.166
Remember, john?

13:07.000 --> 13:10.846
And then this kid walks in, no shoes on,
says, "it's done".

- And what?

She bought new shoes

13:30.200 --> 13:31.611

It was for a good cause.

14:56.280 --> 14:58.282

to get you clinked up and battered,
which I did.

how does that work for you

your line of work, mate?

15:49.560 --> 15:51.085

is for forgiveness, innit?

32:14.000 --> 32:15.729

32:16.880 --> 32:21.807
So... Now... Hello!

32:22.000 --> 32:25.641
Right, I think it is fair to say,
yeah, £1,500?

32:25.800 --> 32:27.040
(SCOFFING) Fifteen hundred.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.248
Mmm, yeah,
I will give you £1,800.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.564

you got there, innit?

32:41.760 --> 32:44.843

I won't be able to focus.

32:55.360 --> 32:56.521
Do you understand?

32:56.600 --> 32:58.807
Mr Romanov, let me remind you

32:58.880 --> 33:01.645
we were told to come here
and choose what we like

33:02.160 --> 33:03.685
and now we have chosen.

33:03.760 --> 33:06.969
Tsar Nicholas gave you that.
I will give you four.

33:07.040 --> 33:09.646
Five, with the royal provenance.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.606
Done.

33:13.680 --> 33:16.411
All right, Rumplestiltskin,
let's go over here

33:16.480 --> 33:18.881

You shouldn't go looking through
other people's private things.

53:32.440 --> 53:33.851
He's my son.

53:35.440 --> 53:38.091
The bullet was mine.
I never got a chance to fire it.

53:38.160 --> 53:41.642
And the gypsy rules
say it must be passed on...

53:41.720 --> 53:43.165
It's not about rules, Pol.

53:43.240 --> 53:44.571
It's about he asked me.

53:47.040 --> 53:48.690
It's about he told me

53:48.760 --> 53:50.285
why he wanted to do it.

53:51.280 --> 53:52.725
Now, if I tell you,

53:53.640 --> 53:55.529
I can't take the knowledge back.

53:58.040 --> 53:59.451
Better off without it.

54:04.280 --> 54:05.805
So this is when
he was with the parish...

54:05.920 --> 54:07.126
Better off without it, Pol.

54:19.560 --> 54:22.245
This is when he was with the Fathers.

54:22.600 --> 54:25.968
This is when he was in
the care of the Holy Fathers.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.762
Michael wants it
so you don't know...

54:39.400 --> 54:41.243
- That priest...
- That priest

54:42.760 --> 54:45.730
who was there when he was taken in.

54:46.960 --> 54:49.406
And who is still walking
the fucking Earth.

54:49.480 --> 54:50.686
Fuck...

54:59.160 --> 55:00.207
Fuck...

55:00.280 --> 55:01.964
He asked me, Pol...

55:02.320 --> 55:04.004
And I said yes.

55:08.640 --> 55:10.051
And I said,

55:10.440 --> 55:14.684
"You put a bullet
in that fucker's brains.

55:16.680 --> 55:18.967
"By order of the Peaky Blinders."

55:24.520 --> 55:25.521
(SNIFF5)

55:26.640 --> 55:27.971
(EXHALING)

55:31.240 --> 55:32.287
No.

55:34.600 --> 55:35.806
Not my son.

55:39.320 --> 55:40.970
He'll still be as
dead if Arthur does it.

55:41.320 --> 55:43.448
And part of him will always stay dead.

55:47.320 --> 55:49.641
- I swear to God...
- In whose house it took place...

55:49.720 --> 55:52.166
If my son pulls the trigger,

55:53.600 --> 55:57.844
I will bring this whole fucking
organisation down around your ears.

56:10.520 --> 56:12.522
