WEBVTT

00:11.054 --> 00:12.273
Getting late, huh?

00:12.316 --> 00:13.665
Yeah.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.537
If this goes any
further tonight,

00:15.580 --> 00:17.060
we're going to have to
go back to your place.

00:18.496 --> 00:19.671
At least, when
my mom passes,

00:19.715 --> 00:21.456
I inherit the house.

00:21.499 --> 00:24.285
Good to know.

00:25.851 --> 00:28.898
Becky told me
that you don't say much.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.552
Don't worry.

00:30.595 --> 00:33.076
That's a quality
I value in a woman.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.991
Would you excuse me?

00:35.035 --> 00:37.733
I'm gonna freshen up.
Sure.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.343
I'll be right here.

00:45.349 --> 00:46.307
Again.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.570
BARTENDER:
You got it.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.137
Rough night?

00:51.312 --> 00:53.401
Blind date.

00:53.444 --> 00:55.446
On a boat.

00:55.490 --> 00:57.231
Nowhere to go.

00:57.274 --> 00:58.884
Overboard.

00:58.928 --> 01:00.582
[laughs gently]

01:00.625 --> 01:01.844
Should I call the coast guard?

01:01.887 --> 01:04.586
No need.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.805
I am the
coast guard.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.720
CGIS Special Agent
Abigail Borin.

01:08.764 --> 01:10.461
First Lieutenant Jeremy Nolan.

01:11.636 --> 01:13.029
Agent Borin,

01:13.073 --> 01:14.683
if your date continues
to get worse,

01:14.726 --> 01:15.771
will I see you back here?

01:15.814 --> 01:18.513
Safe bet.

01:18.556 --> 01:21.081
Good.

01:23.387 --> 01:26.390
MAN:
There you are.

01:26.434 --> 01:27.087
Thought I lost ya.

01:28.523 --> 01:32.135
No chance of that.
[chuckles]

01:32.179 --> 01:34.006
[gunfire]What was that?!

01:34.050 --> 01:34.964
[gunfire continues,
people screaming]

01:35.007 --> 01:36.226
Get down!

01:36.270 --> 01:38.098
[people screaming, clamoring]

02:42.074 --> 02:44.555
2:00 a.m. on a Friday night.

02:46.644 --> 02:48.298
In a parallel universe,

02:48.342 --> 02:51.214
the Tony DiNozzo that
didn't become a cop is

02:51.258 --> 02:54.217
walking out of a bar
with a beautiful lady

02:54.261 --> 02:57.220
he doesn't know
the name of... yet.

02:57.264 --> 02:58.787
How romantic.As romantic

02:58.830 --> 03:01.311
as your...
Cuban Casanova?

03:01.355 --> 03:03.487
He's not Cuban.
Oh.

03:03.531 --> 03:04.880
Must be tough.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.838
Make time for each other.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.144
You're stuck here,

03:08.188 --> 03:09.928
finishing case
reports, and he's

03:09.972 --> 03:12.192
frolicking in the Miami sun.

03:12.235 --> 03:14.933
He travels... a lot.

03:14.977 --> 03:16.848
Which is why I'm
using comp time

03:16.892 --> 03:18.415
to take three days off next week

03:18.459 --> 03:19.938
to go see him.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.766
You can't do that.

03:21.810 --> 03:24.029
Why not? We're adults.No, not that.

03:24.073 --> 03:26.945
You can't use
comp time for days off.

03:26.989 --> 03:30.210
According to the
OPM guidelines, I can.

03:30.253 --> 03:31.776
Tony, how long have you
been a senior field agent?

03:37.608 --> 03:38.957
I just never thought

03:39.001 --> 03:40.785
there was anything very useful
in those things.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.439
"Even though
NCIS employees

03:42.483 --> 03:45.660
"are salaried, any
scheduled overtime hours

03:45.703 --> 03:47.270
"must be compensated monetarily

03:47.314 --> 03:48.576
"or with...

03:48.619 --> 03:49.664
time off."
Yeah, I was

03:49.707 --> 03:51.187
actually told that
they prefer us

03:51.231 --> 03:52.754
to take the time off.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.103
Well, no one told me!

03:54.146 --> 03:56.105
They just send
me the money.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.672
Then what are you
complaining about?

03:57.715 --> 03:59.717
I don't need more money.

03:59.761 --> 04:00.979
I need more time.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.459
Just think of
all the women

04:02.503 --> 04:04.244
I could've dated.

04:04.287 --> 04:05.854
I would rather not.

04:05.897 --> 04:08.248
Respectfully dated.

04:08.291 --> 04:09.510
But it's never too late.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.251
What are you doing?!

04:12.382 --> 04:14.254
Tallying up my overtime.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.734
Aw, you got more coming, Skippy.

04:16.778 --> 04:18.127
Grab your gear.

04:18.170 --> 04:21.173
TONY: Got another
all-nighter?

04:21.217 --> 04:22.523
You can sleep
when you're dead.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.879
I need this area kept
clear of passengers,

04:30.922 --> 04:32.837
even if they claim
to be my date.

04:32.881 --> 04:33.751
Mm-hmm.Mm-hmm.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.927
Agent Gibbs.
Agent Borin.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.714
We gotta stop
meeting like this.

04:39.757 --> 04:42.673
You mean when NCIS takes
over one of my cases.

04:42.717 --> 04:45.154
My call was a courtesy,
not an invitation.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.591
Body trumps boat.

04:51.769 --> 04:52.857
That's a nice dress.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.338
Are you cold?

04:55.382 --> 04:58.341
Tried to give him CPR.
And no.

04:58.385 --> 05:01.388
The, uh, gift shop was
all out of pantsuits.

05:03.172 --> 05:04.695
Unless you'd rather
just go home.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.654
And let you have
all the fun?

05:06.697 --> 05:08.351
Don't think you're
getting rid of me

05:08.395 --> 05:09.700
that easily, Gibbs.

05:09.744 --> 05:12.224
I didn't.

05:12.268 --> 05:13.748
Not only was I on the boat

05:13.791 --> 05:15.097
at the time of the murder,

05:15.140 --> 05:17.186
I was the last person
to see the victim alive,

05:17.229 --> 05:18.840
so I'm here for
the long haul.

05:18.883 --> 05:21.016
Glad to have you onboard.

05:21.059 --> 05:24.324
Our victim is
Marine Lieutenant Jeremy Nolan.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.021
He was having dinner

05:26.064 --> 05:27.805
with his sister
and uncle.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.329
Metro PD's got them

05:29.372 --> 05:31.983
up on the deck, along with
the rest of the passengers.

05:32.027 --> 05:33.158
You got a murder weapon?

05:33.202 --> 05:35.726
It's likely at the
bottom of the river.

05:35.770 --> 05:39.164
But none of the passengers have
been allowed to disembark.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.558
Which means that our killer
could still be onboard.

05:41.602 --> 05:42.429
Mm-hmm.

05:46.607 --> 05:48.304
Navy looks good on you, Borin.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.090
TONY:
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:52.134 --> 05:53.135
excuse me.

05:53.178 --> 05:54.397
If I could have
your attention.

05:54.441 --> 05:56.138
Thank you.

05:56.181 --> 05:57.444
I know it's been a long night.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.533
Consider it your murder mystery

05:59.576 --> 06:01.056
dinner theater on the Potomac.

06:01.099 --> 06:02.884
It was dinner.

06:02.927 --> 06:04.102
Now it's breakfast.

06:04.146 --> 06:06.366
Well, looks like Colonel
Mustard was killed

06:06.409 --> 06:09.499
on the deck
with a lead pipe,

06:09.543 --> 06:11.545
maybe lead bullets, and...

06:11.588 --> 06:14.156
[with Poirot-like accent]:
only by interrogating

06:14.199 --> 06:17.768
each and every one of you
individually...

06:17.812 --> 06:19.379
"can we hope to see the light."

06:19.422 --> 06:20.902
[clears throat]

06:20.945 --> 06:23.426
It's Albert Finney,
doing, uh, Hercule Poirot--

06:23.470 --> 06:27.561
1974's Murder on
the Orient Express.

06:27.604 --> 06:28.997
[clears throat]

06:29.040 --> 06:29.563
Well, the murderer very well
could be with us now,

06:29.606 --> 06:32.522
so, excuse me--

06:32.566 --> 06:34.829
can I please have you
all take your seats;

06:34.872 --> 06:37.440
we will get to you
one by one.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.355
Thank you.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.792
Jeremy just got back
from Afghanistan.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.533
This was meant to be

06:43.577 --> 06:45.013
a celebration to
welcome him home.

06:45.056 --> 06:48.233
Kimberly and I are
Jeremy's only family.

06:48.277 --> 06:49.626
And you're Lieutenant
Nolan's uncle.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.933
Yes. Wayne Grossman.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.804
Look, we already told all
this to Metro Police.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.025
It's just
Jeremy survived

06:57.068 --> 06:59.810
18 months overseas,
only to be gunned down

06:59.854 --> 07:01.246
four days after
he came home.

07:01.290 --> 07:02.857
Kimberly, were you with
your brother the entire night?

07:02.900 --> 07:04.424
Yes.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.469
Until he went to get
a drink from the bar.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.297
[text message chiming]KIMBERLY: Oh, no.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.302
The paparazzi already
know about Jeremy.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.347
They're outside
the marina now.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.088
Paparazzi?!

07:17.132 --> 07:18.699
For a Marine lieutenant?

07:18.742 --> 07:20.701
And me.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.442
You didn't recognize
our last name?

07:24.705 --> 07:25.357
McGEE:
Oh, you're the

07:25.401 --> 07:27.621
Kimberly Nolan.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.492
TheKimberly Nolan.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.630
Looks like he tried to

07:36.673 --> 07:38.327
crawl out of the line of fire.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.503
Well, it's too little,
too late.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.505
Damage was
already done.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.683
Well, he seemed
like a nice guy.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.207
Guess it's true
what they say--

07:49.251 --> 07:50.948
all the good
ones are taken.

07:50.992 --> 07:52.776
Or dead.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.430
Well, that's what I meant,
you know-- taken.

07:55.823 --> 07:58.086
He's not really
my type, anyway.

07:58.129 --> 07:59.957
What, rich and famous?

08:00.001 --> 08:01.698
Well, that never hurts.

08:01.742 --> 08:02.786
Why?

08:02.830 --> 08:03.874
Because the
lieutenant

08:03.918 --> 08:04.875
was both.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.398
Jeremy Nolan is the only son

08:06.442 --> 08:08.488
of the late Jack Nolan.

08:08.531 --> 08:11.273
Didn't know he was
one of those Nolans.

08:11.316 --> 08:12.492
BORIN: The family's
worth millions.

08:12.535 --> 08:13.536
And yet, our victim

08:13.580 --> 08:15.277
walked away from
the family business

08:15.320 --> 08:17.018
to become a Marine.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.107
Guess he was one
of the good ones.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.038
McGee. You awake?

08:37.081 --> 08:38.692
[clears throat]

08:38.735 --> 08:40.302
I'm sorry, boss. Yes.

08:40.345 --> 08:43.958
Never quite get used
to these extra hours.

08:44.001 --> 08:46.700
I don't know how you and
Agent Borin stay so, uh...

08:46.743 --> 08:48.005
Peppy?

08:48.049 --> 08:50.747
No, no, no.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.401
Uh, it's just that...

08:52.444 --> 08:54.142
you two have a lot in common.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.273
Like what?

08:55.317 --> 08:57.580
BORIN:
Coffee?

08:57.624 --> 08:59.930
Did you bring
cream and sugar?
No.

08:59.974 --> 09:01.018
Stopped off at
the office.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.411
Got some info
on our dead Marine.

09:03.151 --> 09:04.544
Mm!

09:06.937 --> 09:08.765
Yuck.

09:08.809 --> 09:11.594
Now, boss, victim is
Lieutenant Jeremy Nolan.

09:11.638 --> 09:14.075
He was commissioned
three years ago.

09:16.817 --> 09:20.777
Nolan was being groomed to
take over the family business.

09:20.821 --> 09:23.606
Kid chose the battlefield
over the boardroom.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.608
It's a choice his
father took personally.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.915
Apparently, the two
never spoke again.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.612
His father cut him
out of the will

09:29.656 --> 09:31.832
and his family fortune.

09:31.875 --> 09:34.182
Hell of a way to thank him
for serving his country.

09:34.225 --> 09:37.489
Jack Nolan died six months
ago, from a heart attack.

09:37.533 --> 09:40.275
He started the company
in his backyard.

09:40.318 --> 09:42.277
Now Nolan Radar Systems
is one of the country's

09:42.320 --> 09:43.757
biggest aviation
suppliers,

09:43.800 --> 09:46.629
which makes them a very wealthy,
very well-known family.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.500
Yeah, then the
sister went viral.

09:48.544 --> 09:49.763
What'd she have?

09:52.287 --> 09:54.506
Uh, not "sick" viral,
Internet viral.

09:54.550 --> 09:58.293
Yeah. Leaked sex tape
spread across the Internet.

09:58.336 --> 10:00.774
Do you want to see it?No.
No.

10:00.817 --> 10:01.775
GIBBS:
Enemies?

10:01.818 --> 10:02.906
BORIN:
None.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.430
Nolan outworked
every lieutenant

10:05.474 --> 10:06.693
in his battalion;
guy stacked up

10:06.736 --> 10:08.738
citations like it
was cordwood.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.393
Probably trying to prove that
he deserved to be there.

10:11.436 --> 10:13.830
Somebody wanted him dead.

10:13.874 --> 10:14.918
Dinner boat.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.793
Yes, boss.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.882
Ran backgrounds on
all of the passengers.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.275
No connections to
our victim or this family.

10:24.319 --> 10:25.973
Nice work, McGee.

10:26.016 --> 10:27.365
Tony and Ziva
are interviewing

10:27.409 --> 10:28.628
the last of them now.

10:29.759 --> 10:32.240
MAN:
It's Steve.

10:32.283 --> 10:33.328
Steve Mehlman.

10:33.371 --> 10:34.546
She hasn't mentioned me?

10:34.590 --> 10:36.113
We were really
hitting it off.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.942
You and Agent Borin?Oh, yeah.

10:38.986 --> 10:41.336
Is it all right if
I hit the head now?
Oh!

10:44.818 --> 10:47.472
Agent Borin's a lucky lady.

10:47.516 --> 10:50.388
Don't worry, Ziva,
you'll find your Mehlman.

10:50.432 --> 10:52.129
If you do, run.

10:52.173 --> 10:54.175
I've been avoiding him
since last night.

10:54.218 --> 10:56.612
Anything from
the interviews?
There was

10:56.656 --> 10:58.614
no sign of the murder weapon
anywhere onboard,

10:58.658 --> 10:59.746
and, uh, no positive

10:59.789 --> 11:01.051
GSR tests.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.271
So our shooter wore gloves
and changed clothes.

11:03.314 --> 11:04.446
Witnesses?
No one saw

11:04.489 --> 11:05.621
what happened on deck.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.101
Any good news?

11:07.144 --> 11:08.493
Yeah.

11:08.537 --> 11:11.235
A couple remembers seeing
a man in a Marine uniform

11:11.279 --> 11:12.280
get into an argument with

11:12.323 --> 11:14.630
a member of
the boat's waitstaff.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.197
And that happened
about, um,

11:16.240 --> 11:18.242
10 minutes before the gunshots.

11:18.286 --> 11:20.505
Just before I met
Nolan at the bar.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.029
We're on our way
to I.D. the crewmember,

11:22.072 --> 11:23.378
using the couple's description.

11:23.421 --> 11:25.641
In the meantime, what
about the other passengers?

11:25.685 --> 11:26.773
Long as you know
where to find them,

11:26.816 --> 11:27.774
let them go.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.645
Finally...

11:29.689 --> 11:31.212
So, uh...

11:31.255 --> 11:32.692
want me to drive you home?

11:35.738 --> 11:39.176
Celebrities
have always existed--

11:39.220 --> 11:42.092
from promiscuous monarchs
to Roman gladiators.

11:42.136 --> 11:45.922
In fact, when the Olympians
returned home victorious,

11:45.966 --> 11:47.750
they used to take out
a section of

11:47.794 --> 11:49.752
the city walls,
so that the athletes

11:49.796 --> 11:50.971
wouldn't have to...

11:51.014 --> 11:54.191
pass through the same gate
as mere mortals.

11:54.235 --> 11:58.630
These days, however,
fame is more easily obtained.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.894
Anyone with enough money and
a lack of self-respect

12:00.937 --> 12:02.852
can become famous
just by being famous.

12:02.896 --> 12:06.290
We've gone from
Socrates to Snooki.

12:06.334 --> 12:09.685
You know, I-I can understand you
wanting to distance yourself

12:09.729 --> 12:12.819
from such a frivolous lifestyle.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.995
Marines are as far as
it gets, Duck. Bullets?

12:16.257 --> 12:18.999
Both are
nine-millimeters.

12:19.042 --> 12:20.914
And judging by these
trajectories, both were

12:20.957 --> 12:22.524
fired from an
unusually low angle.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.091
The shooter must have

12:24.134 --> 12:26.006
positioned himself
below his victim.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.485
Possibly crouched.

12:27.529 --> 12:29.749
Lying in wait.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.489
Lack of gunshot
residue on his

12:31.533 --> 12:32.752
skin or clothing

12:32.795 --> 12:34.754
indicates that
the shots were fired

12:34.797 --> 12:36.581
from at least 20 feet away.

12:36.625 --> 12:37.626
No exit wounds?

12:37.669 --> 12:39.802
No.
Which suggests

12:39.846 --> 12:42.326
low-powder, low-velocity
rounds were used.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.328
Which makes putting
two in his chest

12:44.372 --> 12:45.808
at that distance quite a feat.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.375
I'm impressed.

12:47.418 --> 12:49.246
Military training.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.508
Perhaps.

12:50.552 --> 12:51.727
Jethro, did you know

12:51.771 --> 12:53.250
that apart from being one of the

12:53.294 --> 12:54.991
greatest marksmen in history,

12:55.035 --> 12:59.517
Herb Parsons was also
a champion duck-caller.

12:59.561 --> 13:00.562
No.

13:00.605 --> 13:01.911
I didn't know that, Duck,

13:01.955 --> 13:03.347
'cause I don't know
who that is.

13:03.391 --> 13:04.914
But if you get
anything else...

13:04.958 --> 13:07.961
Duck, call.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.228
What the hell am I doing here?

13:14.271 --> 13:15.751
I told you I didn't kill anyone.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.579
Well, you are a waiter
on the boat, Doug.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.624
We got witnesses
saying that, uh...

13:19.668 --> 13:21.322
you guys almost
came to blows.

13:21.365 --> 13:23.759
What happened, you take away
his plate prematurely?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.848
Maybe he was planning on
finishing that salmon pâté.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.589
Don't talk down to me, man.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.156
An ex-Marine like yourself
should be used to that.

13:29.199 --> 13:30.635
No such thing as an ex-Marine.

13:30.679 --> 13:32.550
I beg to differ, Doug.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.857
'Cause you got served
the big chicken dinner,

13:34.901 --> 13:35.989
didn't ya?

13:37.425 --> 13:39.644
Bad-conduct discharge.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.298
That's not good.

13:41.342 --> 13:42.647
What did you do?

13:42.691 --> 13:44.998
[papers rustling][laughing]: Oh, no!

13:45.041 --> 13:48.392
Striking a
superior officer?

13:48.436 --> 13:50.003
That's a numbskull move, Doug.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.613
What was he like?

13:51.656 --> 13:53.441
I bet he talked down
to you a lot.

13:53.484 --> 13:54.442
Doesn't mean
I killed anyone.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.226
I guess not.

13:56.270 --> 13:59.490
But you do own a
nine-millimeter, don't ya?

13:59.534 --> 14:01.188
And you got
a bad temper.

14:01.231 --> 14:02.537
Nine-millimeter--

14:02.580 --> 14:05.453
that's the same caliber
as the murder weapon.

14:07.934 --> 14:10.937
Marines who actually complete
a tour of duty, Doug,

14:10.980 --> 14:12.547
they get awfully
thirsty--

14:12.590 --> 14:13.983
the desert and stuff.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.767
What happened,
did you forget to refill

14:15.811 --> 14:17.160
Lieutenant Nolan's water glass?

14:17.204 --> 14:19.423
Stop talking to me like that!

14:19.467 --> 14:21.730
Stop lying to me like that.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.649
So I recognized the rich
son of a bitch,

14:27.692 --> 14:29.781
and I called him out
on being a glory hound.

14:29.825 --> 14:30.826
That a crime?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.262
He gave up a pretty cushy life

14:32.306 --> 14:33.960
to go and join the Marines,
you know that?

14:34.003 --> 14:35.918
We all give
something up.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.615
Thousands of Marines
deploy every year

14:37.659 --> 14:39.052
and put their lives on the line.

14:39.095 --> 14:40.618
The hell makes him
any different?

14:40.662 --> 14:43.447
So you killed Lieutenant
Nolan to prove what?

14:43.491 --> 14:46.363
I told him his
joining up was a stunt.

14:46.407 --> 14:47.625
But I walked away.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.019
Out on deck.

14:53.762 --> 14:56.069
I was on the opposite side
of the boat.

14:57.244 --> 15:00.377
I heard shots...

15:00.421 --> 15:02.510
but I didn't see anything.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.816
Say, listen, you don't mind
if I run ballistics

15:04.860 --> 15:06.296
on your nine-millimeter, do you?

15:06.340 --> 15:07.776
I didn't kill Nolan!

15:07.819 --> 15:09.125
Well, somebody
on the boat did.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.257
You're our prime suspect.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.998
Congratulations, Doug!

15:12.041 --> 15:14.087
I hope he left you a big tip.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.792
Agent Abby! Welcome back.

15:23.835 --> 15:25.098
Here... my
condolences.

15:27.274 --> 15:29.145
Sympathy card.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.973
My condolences on
the loss of Sonny Lee,

15:31.017 --> 15:34.803
the mascot for the Coast Guard
station at Norfolk?

15:34.846 --> 15:36.761
The cocker spaniel
that died two weeks ago?

15:36.805 --> 15:38.241
Right.

15:38.285 --> 15:41.244
Thanks. How did you
even hear about that?

15:41.288 --> 15:44.856
Oh, I'm on an e-mail list
for military service animals.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.989
Gibbs, did you know that

15:47.033 --> 15:48.686
the Coast Guard has
a long tradition

15:48.730 --> 15:51.385
of having an animal mascot
on the ship with them?

15:51.428 --> 15:55.128
And the mascots are so beloved
that they're enlisted.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.130
They have their own service
and medical records,

15:57.173 --> 15:58.566
sometimes even
their own bunk.

15:58.609 --> 15:59.871
It's cool, huh?

15:59.915 --> 16:02.222
How come NCIS
doesn't have a mascot?

16:02.265 --> 16:03.527
We do, Abb.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.661
You.

16:06.704 --> 16:09.620
Oh!

16:09.664 --> 16:11.013
Okay...

16:11.057 --> 16:12.232
So...

16:12.275 --> 16:14.016
I have been trying to recreate

16:14.060 --> 16:15.975
the shooting on the boat deck.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.715
Using the information
from Ducky,

16:17.759 --> 16:20.196
I built a 3-D model
of our victim,

16:20.240 --> 16:21.893
with corresponding
bullet trajectories.

16:21.937 --> 16:23.069
Mm-hmm, and?
And...

16:23.112 --> 16:25.593
it makes no sense.

16:25.636 --> 16:27.073
I can't figure out

16:27.116 --> 16:28.161
where the shooter
was standing.

16:28.204 --> 16:29.118
The angle of the bullets

16:29.162 --> 16:30.119
is too severe
to allow the shots

16:30.163 --> 16:32.774
to come from more
than 20 feet away.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.906
There wasn't enough room
on the boat deck.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.430
ABBY:
Right.

16:36.473 --> 16:38.954
No matter how
I line this up,

16:38.998 --> 16:40.216
there's no place
on that boat

16:40.260 --> 16:42.044
that can explain
the angle and the distance

16:42.088 --> 16:43.567
of the bullets' trajectory.

16:43.611 --> 16:46.222
Killer wasn't on the boat.

16:46.266 --> 16:49.051
But using this
trajectory, the shots

16:49.095 --> 16:51.836
would've had to come
from the water itself.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.491
The surface
of the water.

16:54.535 --> 16:57.190
Our shooter wasn't
on the dinner boat.

16:57.233 --> 16:59.061
He was on a second boat.

17:09.071 --> 17:11.943
[sighs]

17:11.987 --> 17:13.945
McGEE: You need something,
Agent Borin?

17:13.989 --> 17:16.774
Coffee? Nutter Butter?
Aspirin?

17:18.298 --> 17:20.648
There's only one thing
giving me a headache, McGee.

17:20.691 --> 17:23.042
And I deserve it.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.956
What's that?
The fact that
I can't remember

17:25.000 --> 17:28.047
seeing a second boat
last night.

17:28.090 --> 17:30.223
I'm a trained
CGIS investigator.

17:30.266 --> 17:33.052
Well, you were
attending to a dying Marine.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.707
"Never make excuses"
is rule number one.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.970
You should write that down.

17:39.014 --> 17:42.539
I would, but rule number one's
already been taken. Twice.

17:42.583 --> 17:43.932
So who are these people?

17:43.975 --> 17:46.152
Friends?
Oh, I don't think

17:46.195 --> 17:47.544
he has any friends.

17:47.588 --> 17:49.155
Maybe Mike Franks or

17:49.198 --> 17:51.157
Fornell, but...
GIBBS:
Butt out, McGee.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.463
Butt off my desk, Borin.

17:53.507 --> 17:56.988
Talked to the captain
of the dinner boat.

17:57.032 --> 17:59.121
He doesn't remember
seeing any other craft

17:59.165 --> 18:01.428
in the area at the time
of the shooting.

18:01.471 --> 18:03.430
So, if our shooter was
on a second boat,

18:03.473 --> 18:05.475
how would
they know that

18:05.519 --> 18:08.043
Jeremy Nolan was going to be
on deck at that exact time?Could have been

18:08.087 --> 18:09.871
at the wrong place
at the wrong time.You think maybe

18:09.914 --> 18:11.525
Nolan wasn't the target?

18:11.568 --> 18:13.396
Well, let's find
the other boat and find out.

18:15.790 --> 18:16.747
Boss, got something here.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.706
Not about our mystery boat,

18:18.749 --> 18:20.055
but about
our victim.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.535
Lieutenant Jeremy Nolan
just showed up

18:21.578 --> 18:24.277
in the Metro Police system
on an assault charge.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.539
BORIN:
Who assaulted him?

18:25.582 --> 18:26.801
No one.

18:26.844 --> 18:29.847
The charge was
against Jeremy Nolan.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.240
It was filed
three days ago.

18:31.284 --> 18:33.634
So, just after he got
back from Afghanistan.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.679
According to the report, charges
were dropped the next day.

18:35.723 --> 18:38.029
Well, that's fast.

18:38.073 --> 18:39.074
Who was the attorney?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.294
McGEE: The uncle--
Wayne Grossman,

18:41.337 --> 18:43.992
lead counsel for
Nolan Radar Systems.I guess our Marine

18:44.035 --> 18:45.167
hadn't completed severed

18:45.211 --> 18:46.690
all ties with his
family business

18:46.734 --> 18:47.778
or their influence.

18:47.822 --> 18:50.129
Send Tony. Send Ziva.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.046
Wonder how the private sector's

18:55.090 --> 18:57.310
benefit package
compares to ours?

18:57.353 --> 18:59.703
Can we discuss your package
another time, Tony?

19:02.358 --> 19:04.143
TONY:
Ah, Mr. Adams.

19:04.186 --> 19:07.363
Special Agents DiNozzo,
David; NCIS.

19:07.407 --> 19:10.366
Please, sit down.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.063
Wow.

19:12.107 --> 19:14.109
Pretty fancy.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.502
Looks like business
is booming.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.243
It is.
It's hard to believe

19:17.286 --> 19:20.507
a company this big is
still owned and operated

19:20.550 --> 19:22.770
by the Nolan family.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.380
So, you're not a part
of the family?

19:24.424 --> 19:26.904
No, but...
you might say adopted.

19:26.948 --> 19:29.211
I started out in the
warehouse when I was 15.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.213
Mr. Nolan sort of
took me under his wing.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.345
And now you're
the president?

19:32.388 --> 19:33.650
CFO.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.217
I run the business side
for the family.

19:35.261 --> 19:38.742
Kimberly, Jeremy's sister,
is on the board,

19:38.786 --> 19:40.309
but it's more of a
ceremonial position.

19:40.353 --> 19:41.789
And Jeremy?

19:41.832 --> 19:43.660
Jeremy wanted
to serve his country.

19:45.009 --> 19:48.752
Joined the Marines
a few years ago.

19:48.796 --> 19:51.146
Good kid-- I'd do
anything for him.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.365

for the person in charge

39:55.654 --> 39:56.959
of Lieutenant Jeremy Nolan's
murder investigation.

39:57.003 --> 39:58.700
That'd be me--

39:58.744 --> 40:00.267
Special Agent Gibbs.

40:00.528 --> 40:03.096
Might want
to know about this.

40:03.139 --> 40:04.619
Could be pertinent
to your case.

40:10.277 --> 40:12.888
Jeremy Nolan's will?

40:12.932 --> 40:14.324
Revised... will.

40:14.368 --> 40:15.935
He had me redraft it

40:15.978 --> 40:17.850
while we were serving
together over in Kandahar.

40:17.893 --> 40:19.504
GIBBS:
You're a lawyer?

40:19.547 --> 40:21.897
Still have a successful
firm in Chicago, sir.

40:21.941 --> 40:24.422
But that doesn't mean I
can't still serve my country

40:24.465 --> 40:25.771
as a reservist.

40:25.814 --> 40:28.469
No, it doesn't.

40:28.513 --> 40:31.254
Jeremy and I had
a lot in common.

40:31.298 --> 40:33.518
Got to be good friends.

40:33.561 --> 40:35.520
A good man.

40:35.563 --> 40:37.739
Good Marine.

40:37.783 --> 40:39.611
He took his sister
out of the will?
Yes.

40:39.654 --> 40:43.484
And he had me draw up articles
of corporate conversion

40:43.528 --> 40:46.182
turning the company into
a nonprofit foundation.

40:46.226 --> 40:47.575
Left everything to charity?

40:47.619 --> 40:50.796
I heard about what happened,
I thought it might be...

40:50.839 --> 40:53.233
motive?

40:53.276 --> 40:54.930
Hope you catch
his killer, sir.

40:54.974 --> 40:56.628
Yeah. Thanks, Captain.

40:56.671 --> 40:58.151
Captain?

40:58.194 --> 41:00.849
We did get him.

41:14.428 --> 41:17.692
Captain's sacrifice inspire you
to give up your comp time, Tony?

41:17.736 --> 41:19.172
No.

41:19.215 --> 41:21.043
I just realized
I have three weeks

41:21.087 --> 41:22.697
of comp time coming to me.

41:22.741 --> 41:24.656
[laughing]: I can't take
that much time off.

41:24.699 --> 41:25.700
Why not?

41:25.744 --> 41:27.180
Because

41:27.223 --> 41:29.922
someone else would get
temporarily assigned to my desk.

41:29.965 --> 41:30.836
Afraid your replacement
will outshine you?

41:30.879 --> 41:32.707
No.

41:32.751 --> 41:34.840
But, you know,

41:34.883 --> 41:36.319
Bledsoe goes down,

41:36.363 --> 41:38.583
and all of a sudden,
there's Tom Brady, and

41:38.626 --> 41:40.367
he's got Gisele Buündchen.

41:40.410 --> 41:42.935
DiNozzo, the game's
never over.

41:42.978 --> 41:44.589
Go on.

41:44.632 --> 41:46.373
All of you.

41:46.416 --> 41:48.288
Get out of here.
