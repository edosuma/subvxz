09:56.762 --> 09:58.930
like, my emotions
and my thoughts.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.932
- So you're at
a better place right now?

10:01.091 --> 10:02.434
- I'm in a much better place
right now, yeah.

10:02.593 --> 10:03.926
- Got it.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.687
- Like, having
my own space, like,

10:05.846 --> 10:07.764
I needed that and I didn't know
how much I needed it, you know?

10:07.848 --> 10:10.350
Like...

10:10.434 --> 10:13.686
Sometimes you think, like,
we're handling stuff in a good

10:13.779 --> 10:17.440
way until I guess it's,
like, kind of like a build up.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.942
- You're in a better place, how?

10:20.027 --> 10:23.029
- Just being able
to know what--I can

10:23.113 --> 10:25.206
pinpoint, like,
what triggers me.

10:25.366 --> 10:26.449
So I know where that starts,

10:26.542 --> 10:28.451
and then I was able to hash out,

10:28.544 --> 10:31.788
like, you know,
how did you get there?

10:31.881 --> 10:34.290
You know,
there's all those details,

10:34.375 --> 10:36.459
and it's like
the finite details, too.

10:36.543 --> 10:39.137
A big thing for us is,
you know, trying

10:39.221 --> 10:41.056
to figure out how
to talk to each other.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.467
- Do you think that
communication issue is, like,

10:44.560 --> 10:45.727
is it something we can overcome?

10:45.811 --> 10:47.303
- I think it is.

10:47.388 --> 10:49.981
The argument that we had
earlier in the week was really

10:50.066 --> 10:53.142
a learning moment
because I realized how we need

10:53.227 --> 10:55.987
to really talk,
and really explain,

10:56.072 --> 11:00.149
and really use our words
when something is bothering us,

11:00.234 --> 11:03.236
and explain what we would like
to see going forward.

11:03.320 --> 11:06.331
- Hi, hi, hello, hi!

11:06.415 --> 11:08.741
I don't know if I'm doing this,
though, hold on.

11:08.826 --> 11:10.669
Hi.

11:11.995 --> 11:13.588
Okay, let's chill out,
let's not get crazy.

11:13.747 --> 11:16.249
- Here, you have some more.

11:16.333 --> 11:19.135
- Okay, so what do you think
we do well in our relationship?

11:22.423 --> 11:26.017
- I don't know,
I think we have fun.

11:26.102 --> 11:30.012
Like, when we go out and we,
like, go do stuff,

11:30.106 --> 11:31.681

have a lot of fun.

11:31.765 --> 11:34.025

kind of had an issue,

31:06.772 --> 31:09.357
So what happened,
Michaela moved out.

31:09.442 --> 31:11.943
That was like a very difficult
situation just because, like,

31:12.036 --> 31:13.778
I think, you know,
by us sleeping in the same bed,

31:13.872 --> 31:16.540
we've been like progressing,
and I think if we don't

31:16.624 --> 31:18.450
do that any more,
then we're taking a step back.

31:18.534 --> 31:20.201
So I'm essentially like,
well, okay, well if

31:20.286 --> 31:22.120
I'm not sleeping the same bed
with you, I just want to, like,

31:22.204 --> 31:23.630
go to my own bed,
in my apartment

31:23.715 --> 31:25.465
to get some comfort for once.

31:25.625 --> 31:27.459
And so she was like, "Whatever,
I don't really care."

31:27.543 --> 31:31.212
So I did that,
and she had a problem with me

31:31.297 --> 31:33.640
doing that,
and so that's why she left.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.216

She wanted you to,

31:35.301 --> 31:37.394
you know, say,
fight a little bit more?

31:37.553 --> 31:38.729

she wanted me to do

31:38.813 --> 31:40.480
was not leave
in the first place.

31:40.640 --> 31:43.066

you just told me "don't leave,"

I'm not gonna--

31:45.320 --> 31:46.561

31:49.240 --> 31:52.159
- One thing I noticed about
Zack and I's relationship is,

31:52.243 --> 31:54.152
I don't know if you
guys have seen, like,

31:54.236 --> 31:56.821
Godzilla versus King Kong,
or those kind of movies where

31:56.906 --> 32:00.000
it's like--it's like a clash,
like, somebody has to win,

32:00.084 --> 32:03.503
nobody's going to submit,
and it is a ceasefire for us,

32:03.663 --> 32:06.081
somebody has to ceasefire,
and I think that's what we're

32:06.174 --> 32:08.675
learning right now
is who's gonna stop.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.844
- What I'm observing
that you guys are able to get

32:10.929 --> 32:13.922
to that point of realness
and openness because you guys

32:14.006 --> 32:15.507
have something that Brett and I

32:15.591 --> 32:17.342
don't have in our relationships.

32:22.098 --> 32:24.015
You might say something
that will hurt him,

32:24.100 --> 32:27.185
but you feel that he's there
and in it with you.

32:27.269 --> 32:31.448
- It takes two,
always, you know and a girl,

32:31.532 --> 32:34.201
in general,
can only take so much.

32:34.285 --> 32:37.621
You know, I've been in past
situations where I'm like,

32:37.780 --> 32:41.700
why am I so obsessed
with someone that is

32:41.793 --> 32:46.129
not giving me anything back,
like, won't text me back,

32:46.288 --> 32:49.967
won't do anything,
yet I think the world of them,

32:50.051 --> 32:54.045
like, I don't get it,
and it's just this, like,

32:54.138 --> 32:57.224
the rose colored glasses
kind of thing, you know?

32:57.308 --> 33:00.385
And thankfully, for me, it
took a disagreement to be like,

33:00.478 --> 33:02.137
"Okay."

33:02.230 --> 33:05.065
After our big argument,
you can call it,

33:05.149 --> 33:08.143

everything on the table.

I was like, you--you're getting
to know polite Rachel who's not

33:11.814 --> 33:15.900
gonna call you out on anything,
but now any little thing,

33:15.985 --> 33:18.319
I'll point out
and he gets upset,

33:18.413 --> 33:20.071
and I'm okay that he gets upset.

33:20.156 --> 33:23.834

33:23.993 --> 33:26.670

take it or leave it.

The minute that
that is rejected,

33:34.095 --> 33:36.254

times back in the day,

35:25.957 --> 35:28.792
I remember when my dad was very

35:28.951 --> 35:32.203
verbally abusive to my mom
and it spiraled.

35:32.288 --> 35:34.706
There was a period
of time in my childhood

35:34.790 --> 35:36.466

46:55.804 --> 46:58.314
I can handle myself
in scenarios like that

46:58.398 --> 47:00.066
to where I don't have
to make a scene about it,

47:00.150 --> 47:02.643
and that's what we have now
is an absolute scene.

47:02.736 --> 47:05.488
- We have an absolute scene,
you think?

47:05.572 --> 47:06.897
- Well, yeah,
'cause--yeah, yeah we do.

47:06.990 --> 47:08.566
- Why do you think that?

47:08.650 --> 47:09.900
- I don't know how else--
You're gonna just---we're

47:09.993 --> 47:11.661
having this conversation
right now because of it.

47:16.491 --> 47:19.293
Yeah, I mean,
I don't know, I guess I...

47:21.922 --> 47:28.594
Was looking for any time
to follow through

47:28.679 --> 47:32.181
with what I said I was gonna do.

47:34.259 --> 47:35.843
- You said that you
were looking forward

47:35.927 --> 47:37.353
to being here
and being in your element.

47:38.856 --> 47:43.609
- I said it could be
only positive for us,

47:43.694 --> 47:48.281
and it was very quickly
the opposite of very positive.

47:48.440 --> 47:52.201
- You go negative so fast.
You think honesty is negative.

47:54.195 --> 47:56.113
You say to call you out,
well, when I call you out,

47:56.206 --> 47:59.041
this is what happens,
and that's the problem,

47:59.126 --> 48:01.878
so I can't call you out
on your [bleep].

48:07.208 --> 48:08.718
- Yeah.

48:10.962 --> 48:14.390
- When someone
asks me for something,

48:14.474 --> 48:17.977
or someone tells me
what their boundaries are,

48:18.061 --> 48:22.899
I respect them to the point
of I ignore what I need.

48:23.058 --> 48:26.560
So if you express to me
that you need patience,

48:26.645 --> 48:29.572
if you express to me that
you need to sleep elsewhere,

48:29.731 --> 48:32.483
I'm gonna give you that,
no holds barred,

48:32.567 --> 48:35.411
you can have it all,
but what that does to me,

48:35.495 --> 48:38.581
then, as a person,
eventually, is I break down.

48:40.909 --> 48:42.910
And I broke.

48:43.995 --> 48:46.672
I know that within my heart,
I was doing

48:46.757 --> 48:50.834
everything under the sun to be
open, to have conversations,

48:50.919 --> 48:54.430
to be sweet, to be what
I think a wife should be.

48:56.174 --> 48:58.017
- And I acknowledge that
I wasn't a lot of those things.

48:58.176 --> 49:00.102
- To give space, you know.

49:01.846 --> 49:05.349
- If I would do anything
different, it would be to not

49:05.433 --> 49:08.945
expect someone to take
my actions for what I

49:09.029 --> 49:10.771
think they
should be perceived as,

49:10.855 --> 49:14.441
because people
need different things.

49:14.534 --> 49:16.285
I don't know what
the right thing to do is

49:16.370 --> 49:18.454
at this point, as far as--

49:18.613 --> 49:20.698
- The right thing to do
is what you feel.

49:20.791 --> 49:24.702
- I'm still--I'm not
completely giving up on this,

49:24.786 --> 49:27.538
I still know
what I want in life,

49:27.631 --> 49:29.540
I know I want a wife,
none of that's changed.
