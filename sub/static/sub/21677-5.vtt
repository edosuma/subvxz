WEBVTT

00:12.458 --> 00:13.000
- Previously on "Below Deck"...

00:14.542 --> 00:15.833
- Shut the f--- up, dude.
- Hey.

00:15.833 --> 00:17.208
- Dude, get the f--- out
of the car!

00:17.208 --> 00:18.375
- This isn't the right place
for you.

00:18.375 --> 00:19.875
Pack your stuff
and leave the boat.

00:19.875 --> 00:21.625
- Thank you, God.

00:21.625 --> 00:23.042
- You're so adorable.

00:23.042 --> 00:24.708
Emily, if something
should happen to my wife...

00:28.667 --> 00:30.375
- Jesus.

00:30.375 --> 00:32.833
This feels like D-list
Quentin Tarantino characters.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.375
- Is this our anniversary
today?

00:34.375 --> 00:36.500
- Yeah, made it
through our first week.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.708
- Nico, girlfriend back home?

00:37.708 --> 00:39.542
- We just recently
started talking.

00:39.542 --> 00:41.833
- Oh, so it's just fresh.
- What about you there, Lauren?

00:41.833 --> 00:43.833
- Single as a Pringle,
let's put it that way.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.208
This is, like,
awkwardly romantic.

00:49.708 --> 00:51.375
- Good night, Emily.
- Night, night.

00:51.375 --> 00:54.250
- Battle is on.
No matter who wins,

00:54.250 --> 00:55.917
friendship doesn't change.
- Oh, no, no.

00:57.875 --> 00:59.417
- That tuna's f---ed.

00:59.417 --> 01:01.083
Can you just take that away?

01:01.083 --> 01:02.417
- Cannot deal with this.

01:02.417 --> 01:04.917
I just want
to f---ing go home.

01:32.542 --> 01:34.583
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:34.583 --> 01:36.583
- Oh, last day.
Back to reality.

01:36.583 --> 01:38.750
- What's cracking, yo?
- We're working hard out here.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.417
For real, though,

01:40.417 --> 01:43.083
um, maybe have a chat
with Sierra today.

01:43.083 --> 01:44.750
She, like, broke down
last night.

01:44.750 --> 01:46.625
She was cleaning up
and she was just like,

01:46.625 --> 01:48.083
"I don't know
if this is for me."

01:48.083 --> 01:49.458
So she's thinking
about leaving.

01:49.458 --> 01:51.292
- That would be f---ed.

01:51.292 --> 01:53.125
Talk about two crew members
down.

01:53.125 --> 01:55.083
- F---.

01:55.083 --> 01:58.625
- She's just got to realize
Ben in the kitchen is brutal.

01:58.625 --> 01:59.792
- Coming.
- Hey, baby.

01:59.792 --> 02:01.292
- How'd you sleep?
All right?

02:01.292 --> 02:02.958
- I didn't go to bed until,
like, 2:00,

02:02.958 --> 02:06.083
but pretty good, though.
- Sierra freaked out last night.

02:06.083 --> 02:08.417
- 12 courses
is really demanding.

02:08.417 --> 02:09.792
I was intense.

02:09.792 --> 02:11.833
It probably rubbed off
on Sierra.

02:11.833 --> 02:14.417
Hopefully we're in better
frames of mind today

02:14.417 --> 02:16.333
'cause there's a miraculous
thing called sleep.

02:16.333 --> 02:18.167
- I don't want her
to become discouraged.

02:18.167 --> 02:20.583
Maybe if you took her aside
and said, "You know,

02:20.583 --> 02:22.500
"last night, there was
a lot going on.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.917
You did a great job."
- Absolutely.

02:25.917 --> 02:27.625
- Hi.
- Hey, baby.

02:27.625 --> 02:30.500
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.500
What's going on?
- It's been really crazy, Mom.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.917
Like, the chef is
a really intense person.

02:35.917 --> 02:39.667
I really flipped out because
I just was so overwhelmed.

02:44.125 --> 02:46.833
- I'm pretty thick-skinned,
but at the same time, like,

02:46.833 --> 02:49.375
I need to have positivity
around me.

02:51.125 --> 02:52.333
- Yes, Mom.
- I love you.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.708
- Love you too.

02:56.167 --> 02:58.208
- Mostly bacon.
- I have a mascarpone

02:58.208 --> 03:00.042
and smoked salmon omelet.
Would you like some?

03:00.042 --> 03:02.375
- A little bit.
- All right, we're gonna have--

03:02.375 --> 03:04.375
- That's fantastic
wrapping paper.

03:04.375 --> 03:08.000
- I'm gonna give you
two sheets of uncut $2 bills.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.167
- It's amazing.

03:11.875 --> 03:14.042
- Hey, it's Sierra.
Where would you like me?

03:14.042 --> 03:16.833
- Please turn over laundry.
- Copy.

03:16.833 --> 03:17.958
- ♪ Hey ♪

03:19.042 --> 03:20.958
♪ Hey ♪

03:20.958 --> 03:22.333

03:22.333 --> 03:24.042
- How are you?
- Good.

03:24.042 --> 03:26.542
- I think I should be
more bashful

03:26.542 --> 03:30.167
when delegating
a part of my job.

03:30.167 --> 03:32.500
- All good.
- You good?

03:32.500 --> 03:35.250
- Yeah. I'm just trying
to chill and stick to myself.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.750
- We've all been there,
and I promise you,

03:37.750 --> 03:39.500
I can't even f---ing explain
to you

03:39.500 --> 03:41.250
how many times
I've been there.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.750
We don't have to chat
about it.

03:42.750 --> 03:45.833
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Yeah? Okay, cool. Cool.

03:45.833 --> 03:48.375

Are you eatin' my fruit? ♪

03:48.375 --> 03:51.583
- Mmm.

03:51.583 --> 03:53.250
That papaya is so good.
- Is it?

03:53.250 --> 03:55.542
- Mm-hmm.

03:55.542 --> 03:59.375
- I already know that tomorrow
is gonna be f---ing epic.

03:59.375 --> 04:00.917
- Ooh, Trevor's not here.

04:00.917 --> 04:02.875
This is the first night out
we've had without him.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.917
I'm not kidding myself.
Like, I have a crush on Nico.

04:04.917 --> 04:06.583
Like, I feel like
he has a crush on me.

04:06.583 --> 04:08.250
It's definitely mutual.

04:08.250 --> 04:09.917
So I'm excited to see
where things go.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.917
- So just to let you know,
there's a great bar near us

04:15.917 --> 04:18.417
called Foxy's.
It's, like, a local favorite.

04:18.417 --> 04:20.292
Does that sound fun?
- Let's go to Foxy's.

04:20.292 --> 04:22.208
- Let's go to Foxy's.
- Perfect.

04:25.417 --> 04:27.417
- Hi, how are you doing?
- I'm fine.

04:27.417 --> 04:28.708
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:28.708 --> 04:30.417
- So breakfast
is wrapping up.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.292
The guests are going
off the boat.

04:32.292 --> 04:34.250
You guys can both go
for a dip.

04:34.250 --> 04:35.583
- Oh, yay.
- Nice, awesome. Thank you.

04:35.583 --> 04:37.292
- Okay?

04:37.292 --> 04:39.125
It always drove me crazy
when anybody ever thought

04:39.125 --> 04:40.542
I was, like, too harsh
of a leader.

04:40.542 --> 04:41.875
I'm actually really lenient.

04:41.875 --> 04:43.292
Let me take my break now

04:43.292 --> 04:44.292
so that while you guys
are swimming,

04:44.292 --> 04:45.583
I'll be working.
- Okay.

04:45.583 --> 04:47.583
- Finally, I have
two stewardesses

04:47.583 --> 04:51.417
who are enthusiastic
and willing to learn,

04:51.417 --> 04:53.708
and for that kind
of stewardess,

04:53.708 --> 04:55.583
I will have all the time
in the world and be so patient.

04:55.583 --> 04:57.083
I'll be back.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.500
- Thank you.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.333
- All right, Lauren.

05:04.333 --> 05:07.250
- Attention, all crew,
all guests are off the boat.

05:07.250 --> 05:09.458
- Emily and Sierra,
if you want to go for a swim,

05:09.458 --> 05:11.333
now is the time.

05:11.333 --> 05:12.917
- Captain, is it cool
if we join the girls

05:12.917 --> 05:15.250
for a dip in the water?
- Roger that.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.083
- Emily reminds me
of my ex, kind of.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.417
Just, like, little, fun,
outgoing.

05:35.417 --> 05:37.333
She's hot.
And if Kelley's not here

05:37.333 --> 05:39.667
and if it's a competition
that he wants,

05:39.667 --> 05:41.958
then it's a competition
that he gets.

05:41.958 --> 05:44.458
- The battle is on.
Work first,

05:44.458 --> 05:46.958
friendship second,
women third.

05:46.958 --> 05:49.667
- I mean, he knows.
He knows that, you know,

05:49.667 --> 05:50.667
I'm gonna win.

05:53.167 --> 05:55.125
- Yeah.
Come on.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.542
- All right, kids.
Guests want to come back,

05:57.542 --> 05:59.875
so everybody
out of the pool.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.875
- Hello, welcome back.
Can I get you anything to drink?

06:07.875 --> 06:10.667
- Can I get a vodka
and something?

06:12.833 --> 06:14.500
- Ken, you've got
some big arms.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.792
You're like one of those
keg-throwing European guys.

06:16.792 --> 06:19.208
- I can do push-ups.
- I can do, like, two.

06:19.208 --> 06:20.625
- I think we should
make a bet.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.208
You two guys
for a push-up contest.

06:22.208 --> 06:25.750
- Okay, it's on.
Who loses gets a bikini wax.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.417
We could do it in a V
for valor.

06:27.417 --> 06:29.167
- Valor.
- I think I got you.

06:29.167 --> 06:30.167
- No.
- Oh, that's cool.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.542
- Seriously,
it's not gonna be pretty.

06:33.542 --> 06:35.417
- Smell like lavender.
- It's, like, an old wives' tale

06:35.417 --> 06:36.875
that people respond
to you better

06:36.875 --> 06:38.750
if you put lavender oil
on your hair.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.833
I'm an emotional person,
but I'm not gonna let

06:40.833 --> 06:42.500
one temper tantrum
from a chef

06:42.500 --> 06:44.417
derail me from what
I want to do.

06:44.417 --> 06:46.750
- Well, I hope--
let's hope that works tonight.

06:46.750 --> 06:50.375
- Kate, we were asking
about getting some bikini wax.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.667
We're gonna have
a push-up competition,

06:51.667 --> 06:53.500
and whoever wins loses...
- Okay.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.500
- One of the ladies that's
with us gets to wax our chest.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.167
- It's pretty cool.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.333
It's not strange for yachts
to host spa parties.

06:59.333 --> 07:02.250
So clearly, this yacht
has hosted one before.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.292
And thankfully,
they left their wax.

07:04.292 --> 07:05.917
- I'll know in, like,
the first one

07:05.917 --> 07:07.417
if I'm gonna--okay.
- Okay. Legs.

07:07.417 --> 07:09.125
- Okay.
- Okay, go.

07:09.125 --> 07:12.250
- Two.

07:12.250 --> 07:16.292
- It's like walruses mating.
- Seven.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.250
I'm f---ed.

07:23.417 --> 07:25.292
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

07:25.292 --> 07:26.708
- All right.

07:26.708 --> 07:28.542
- That's gotta be
heated up, right?

07:28.542 --> 07:30.292
- Yeah.
- I'll get a little bit

07:30.292 --> 07:32.458
of my back waxed
just to be a good sport too.

07:32.458 --> 07:34.708
- Yeah, but we do it
on your ass then.

07:34.708 --> 07:36.542
- No problem.
I got hair there too.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.708
- Okay, we have vodka.

07:40.708 --> 07:42.208
- Say good-bye to Jeremy.

07:42.208 --> 07:44.625
- We have the mobile spa
coming out.

07:44.625 --> 07:46.458
- How can you have
so much hair?

07:46.458 --> 07:47.667
- It's very hot.
You're gonna put it

07:47.667 --> 07:49.500
in the direction
the hair is growing.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.125
and then pull
the opposite way.

07:51.125 --> 07:52.792
- In the direction--
- Hurry before it melts.

07:52.792 --> 07:54.750
- Just watch the nipples.
You'll rip a nipple off.

07:54.750 --> 07:56.333
Not good.
- Aww.

07:56.333 --> 07:58.000
- And you have to do it quick.
You have to let it rip.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.833
- One, two.
- Just f---ing do it.

07:59.833 --> 08:02.125
- Three!
- Ahh!

08:04.958 --> 08:06.167
- Ugh, God.

08:08.917 --> 08:12.000
- Rip fast.
- Ahh!

08:15.250 --> 08:16.625
- Did it hurt?

08:16.625 --> 08:17.833
- What the hell's
wrong with you?

08:19.792 --> 08:21.458
- The look of pain
on Jeremy's face

08:21.458 --> 08:23.250
broke my heart a little bit...

08:23.250 --> 08:25.125
- Yeah, look, there is
blood coming out.

08:25.125 --> 08:26.333
Now he's bleeding.
- Oh, my God.

08:26.333 --> 08:27.667
- When I got done laughing.

08:27.667 --> 08:28.792
- You did it.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.542
- You deserve that.
Well done.

08:32.542 --> 08:33.833
- I deserve a kiss
on the cheek.

08:33.833 --> 08:35.708
- Yeah.
- Aww, well done.

08:35.708 --> 08:36.833
Yeah!

08:36.833 --> 08:38.167
- Now bless my back fat.

08:38.167 --> 08:40.500
- Whoa.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.000
- We're gonna need more wax.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.458
Did you really
want to do it?

08:43.458 --> 08:45.875
- Look at him.
Of course he wants to do it.

08:45.875 --> 08:49.375
- Wow.

08:52.833 --> 08:56.292
- Oh, my God.

08:56.292 --> 08:58.333
- Why is Bigfoot
getting waxed right now?

08:58.333 --> 09:01.542
- How does it look?
- It looks like sh--.

09:03.958 --> 09:07.917
- Thank you.
- Wow. That's pretty impressive.

09:10.042 --> 09:11.917
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

09:11.917 --> 09:13.417
You did not say that.

09:13.417 --> 09:15.208
- Wow, that's quite demeaning.

09:15.208 --> 09:16.750
I find as a female,
in life,

09:16.750 --> 09:18.208
we're going to get comments
from men,

09:18.208 --> 09:20.083
whether it be
walking down the street

09:20.083 --> 09:22.083
and you get car honks,
or whether you're on a yacht

09:22.083 --> 09:24.917
and you get a drunk man
asking to see your V.

09:24.917 --> 09:27.667
It's always going--
you're going to get something.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.208
Can I get anyone else
anything to drink?

09:30.208 --> 09:31.583
- I'll just get some water.
- Water?

09:31.583 --> 09:33.583
- Thank you.
- Okay.

09:40.208 --> 09:42.250
- Ooh!
- Ah.

09:45.708 --> 09:48.083
- Hi.
- Hello, love.

09:48.083 --> 09:50.458
- Thank you very much
for inviting me.

09:50.458 --> 09:53.917
God bless America.
Let's have f---ing fun.

09:56.583 --> 09:59.542
- Truffle mash,
rib eye with lobster.

09:59.542 --> 10:01.625
Okay, that's Dover sole
for Carolina.

10:01.625 --> 10:03.083
- Oh, surf and turf.

10:03.083 --> 10:05.083
- And for you,
we've got Dover sole.

10:05.083 --> 10:06.417
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.125
- This is the Chianti,
but if you want to start

10:10.125 --> 10:12.417
a new wine after that,
we've got other options.

10:17.292 --> 10:21.458
- What?

10:21.458 --> 10:22.958
He just tried to kiss me.
He just tried...

10:22.958 --> 10:24.458
Are you f---ing kidding me?

10:24.458 --> 10:25.958
- Come in.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.000
- This is the Chianti,

10:35.583 --> 10:36.000
but if you want to start

10:37.917 --> 10:39.542
a new wine after that,
we've got other options.

10:43.167 --> 10:44.917
- Creepy is creepy,

10:44.917 --> 10:46.667
and I can't wait
for these guests to leave.

10:46.667 --> 10:49.292
He's like, "I'll try that wine."
I was like, "Certainly."

10:49.292 --> 10:51.917
And he goes,
"And I'll try you too."

10:51.917 --> 10:55.583
- No. Okay, Nico, so tonight
if I call you on the radio

10:55.583 --> 10:57.292
and tell you that
zucchinis are burning,

10:57.292 --> 11:00.333
that means you come ASAP
to my rescue.

11:00.333 --> 11:02.750
- Please keep your zucchini
away from my oven.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.083
- Deal.

11:06.167 --> 11:08.458
That was so amazing.

11:08.458 --> 11:11.333
- Mr. Chow liked it, right?
- They loved it, the guys.

11:11.333 --> 11:13.000
- This is a very easy evening.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.542
- Let's go to sleep.
- Yep.

11:14.542 --> 11:17.000
- I'm so tired.
- No 12-course dinner.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.708
And no tears in the galley.

11:18.708 --> 11:19.833
Good night.

11:19.833 --> 11:21.125
- Okay.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.875
- You can start pulling
whenever you're ready.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.792
- I love bacon.
God bless America.

11:34.792 --> 11:36.375
- God bless America.
- For bacon.

11:38.167 --> 11:40.542
- The anchor's home
and secure.

11:40.542 --> 11:42.208
- Pull the snubber off
and let's get out of here.

11:47.542 --> 11:49.000
- You guys don't even know
what's under this.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.458
It's so gross.
Come here.

11:51.458 --> 11:52.708
- Kate--
- Oh, God.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.875
- Oh, my God.

11:57.875 --> 12:00.833
- I love laminating things.

12:00.833 --> 12:03.750
I think it's
the perfect gift.

12:03.750 --> 12:06.375
- Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no.
- Oh, God. Oh, no. Okay.

12:09.917 --> 12:12.417
- This channel keeps getting
smaller and smaller.

12:12.417 --> 12:16.042
- Cap, you got 60 feet in
opening on your starboard aft.

12:16.042 --> 12:17.500
- I tell you what,
if stupid could fly,

12:17.500 --> 12:20.042
these guys would be
7-4s.

12:20.042 --> 12:21.375
- Phew.

12:21.375 --> 12:23.000
- Does it smell
like burned hair?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.208
- It's disgusting.
- We're gonna present it

12:25.208 --> 12:27.708
to our guest.
- Do it after the tip.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.875
- Hey, we'll put
the stern line on first,

12:32.875 --> 12:34.583
and the rest,
you'll hand to me.

12:34.583 --> 12:36.167
No, no, no, no, no.
We're gonna hand it to you.

12:40.583 --> 12:43.625
We'll worry about that later.
Can you hand me that line?

12:43.625 --> 12:45.583
Jesus Christ.

12:45.583 --> 12:49.250
This dude on the dock is
moving like a frickin' turtle.

12:49.250 --> 12:52.250
Yeah, yeah, put the eyelet.
- Pull in that bowline.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.792
- Way up there.
- Hey, Nico, Nico.

12:53.792 --> 12:55.625
Can you come to the bow?

12:55.625 --> 12:57.042
- Yeah, Kelley.
Hold on one second.

12:57.042 --> 12:58.083
We need a spring here.

13:01.458 --> 13:03.250
- Lauren?
- Yeah?

13:03.250 --> 13:06.042
- Kelley, pull that forward
spring in a little bit, can you?

13:06.042 --> 13:09.125
- Everything factors in, whether
it's the lines, the fenders.

13:09.125 --> 13:11.292
To be down a man now, it's--
you know,

13:11.292 --> 13:13.125
it could potentially lead
to damaging the boat

13:13.125 --> 13:14.625
or having an accident.

13:14.625 --> 13:16.458
- Hey, Captain,
I can't get that one.

13:16.458 --> 13:17.958
It's underneath the spring.
I need someone up--

13:17.958 --> 13:20.000
oh, f---.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.500
Nico, can you come
to the bow?

13:21.500 --> 13:23.083
- On my way, one second.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.667
Take that off.
- Yep.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.458
- I'm gonna jump back on
right now.

13:26.458 --> 13:30.250
- Dude, don't jump off the boat
in the middle of docking.

13:30.250 --> 13:31.750
Can't get the, uh...
- No worries, man.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.167
- Abreast line.
Tighten that one up.

13:33.167 --> 13:35.667
- Pull up on that.
- We can shut 'em down.

13:35.667 --> 13:37.000
Attention all crew,
I need everybody

13:37.000 --> 13:38.625
on the aft deck in ten.

13:38.625 --> 13:40.125
- Deck crew acknowledges.

13:40.125 --> 13:41.625
- Just got to...

13:41.625 --> 13:43.750
I mean, they're f---ing
crinkled, whatever.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.667
Really?

13:45.667 --> 13:49.500
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's line 'em up.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.167
- Hello.
It was great to meet you.

13:52.167 --> 13:53.625
I hope you all enjoyed
your trip, okay.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.083
- Thank you.
- Have safe travels home, okay.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.792
- This is for the guys.
- Okay.

13:58.792 --> 14:00.500
Jeremy, it was so lovely
having you on board.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.875
- You--oh, my goodness.
Unbelievable.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.000
- We made you
a little something.

14:05.208 --> 14:07.208
- Thank you.
Thank you for this.

14:08.667 --> 14:10.875
I'll remember this.
- I bet you will.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.833
- Unbelievable.
I think I speak for everyone.

14:12.833 --> 14:15.875
Amazing life experience.
- Fantastic job.

14:15.875 --> 14:18.708
I was really looking forward
to tasting your cooking.

14:18.708 --> 14:20.667
You did not disappoint.
- Thank you.

14:20.667 --> 14:21.958
- You guys did
an amazing job.

14:21.958 --> 14:23.375
We have something
for you, Captain.

14:23.375 --> 14:24.708
- Oh.
- Thank you very much.

14:24.708 --> 14:26.125
- Well, thank you.
- Well deserved.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.458
- Thanks, Jeremy.
- Thank you very much.

14:27.458 --> 14:28.875
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

14:28.875 --> 14:30.333
- "Do you have anything
to declare?"

14:30.333 --> 14:32.667
"Yes, uh, chest hair."
- Chest hair.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.167
That's awesome.

14:34.167 --> 14:35.792
- Let's get to work.
Flip the boat.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.542
- Thanks.

14:40.875 --> 14:43.083
- We gotta have a little talk.
- All right.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.375
- Today when we were
coming in docking...

14:44.375 --> 14:45.542
- Yeah.
- Just don't hop off

14:45.542 --> 14:46.917
the boat again.
- Okay.

14:46.917 --> 14:49.083
- Just in case
he gets blown off the dock

14:49.083 --> 14:50.750
or something like that.
- Yeah. Sorry about that.

14:50.750 --> 14:53.500
- Nico jumping off the boat
is a bad reflection on me.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.917
The captain's watching me
like a hawk,

14:54.917 --> 14:57.417
and after the sh-- show
that was Trevor,

14:57.417 --> 15:00.042
I need the Captain to know
that I can run my deck team.

15:00.042 --> 15:01.375
- 100% agree.
- Cool.

15:01.375 --> 15:02.750
- And it won't happen again.

15:02.750 --> 15:05.083
- Awesome.

15:06.667 --> 15:08.208
- Attention all crew,
I need everybody

15:08.208 --> 15:10.708
in the crew mess
in two minutes.

15:13.042 --> 15:16.583
- Hello people.
- Hi.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.000
- So I know we touched

15:18.000 --> 15:19.875
on communication
in the last charter.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.417
How'd that work out
in the interior?

15:21.417 --> 15:23.250
Is it working better?
- Yep.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.917
- Oh, yeah.

15:24.917 --> 15:27.458
- I know you had a bit of a,
uh, wrench thrown into things

15:27.458 --> 15:31.083
with the one guest who didn't
like anything in the world.

15:31.083 --> 15:35.792
But it must have gone
fairly well because...

15:35.792 --> 15:37.625
Strip club?

15:37.625 --> 15:39.375
- Yeah.

15:39.375 --> 15:42.125
- Oh, there we go.
- That looks pretty good.

15:42.125 --> 15:44.708
- 20.
- Ho, ho, ho, ho.

15:44.708 --> 15:47.875
- Split ten ways,
thank you, Trevor.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.292
$2,000 apiece.
- Wow.

15:51.292 --> 15:53.792
- From Jeremy having
his waxing done

15:53.792 --> 15:56.292
to inappropriate attention,

15:56.292 --> 15:57.625
we've definitely
earned this tip.

15:57.625 --> 15:59.417
- You can go out
this evening.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.708
And on that note,
you can all count 'em out

16:01.708 --> 16:03.917
and give me a hand.

16:06.500 --> 16:10.292
- One, two, three,
four, five.

16:10.292 --> 16:12.000
Can we get leftover ones
that I can marry

16:12.000 --> 16:13.333
with my leftover ones?
- Yes, I have six.

16:13.333 --> 16:14.500
- What have you got?
What do you need?

16:14.500 --> 16:16.167
- I have two ones left over.
Anybody?

16:16.167 --> 16:19.333
- Here, I've got leftover ones.
- You've got 76?

16:19.333 --> 16:21.958
- Here's 24.
That makes 100.

16:21.958 --> 16:25.625
- This is not gonna be as easy
as I anticipated at all.

16:33.292 --> 16:36.458
- Yeah, we killed it.
You killed it. We all killed it.

16:36.458 --> 16:37.917
- I'm so happy right now.

16:37.917 --> 16:39.500
Can't even mess with this
right here.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.292
See this vibe going?
You could try to mess with it.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.500
Try. I dare you.
- I don't want to try.

16:42.500 --> 16:43.667
- No, no energy.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.167
- I will lose
against your vibage.

16:45.167 --> 16:47.042
- You can't, you can't.
- I will lose.

16:47.042 --> 16:48.792
- You're gonna lose.
- I will lose.

16:48.792 --> 16:50.333
- I really enjoy
working with Lauren.

16:50.333 --> 16:51.708
She's just good vibes.

16:51.708 --> 16:54.125
It's become like
a brother/sister bond.

16:54.125 --> 16:55.542
- I always sat next to a guy
in class

16:55.542 --> 16:57.333
who used to pick his scabs
and eat it.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.667
And he would take it all off
so it's like one big corn flake

16:59.667 --> 17:00.833
and just, like...

17:00.833 --> 17:02.833
- She's super open with me,

17:02.833 --> 17:04.500
and I'm super open with her,

17:04.500 --> 17:07.000
and it's just a friendship
that's forming

17:07.000 --> 17:08.625
into something really nice.

17:08.625 --> 17:12.208
This is a zone.

17:12.208 --> 17:13.542
- Yeah.
- It's a bubble.

17:13.542 --> 17:15.500
- Yeah,
and it cannot be popped.

17:15.500 --> 17:19.042
- I don't know what's going on
between Nico and Lauren.

17:19.042 --> 17:21.333
I think for Nico,
Lauren's been friend-zoned.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.292
I'm not sure
Lauren's aware of that.

17:27.333 --> 17:29.208
- Kate, Ben, and Kelley,
I need all three of you

17:29.208 --> 17:31.000
in the crew mess in two.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.750
- Kelley and Ben rogers.
- Copy.

17:34.750 --> 17:36.375
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:36.375 --> 17:39.750
Charter four. We have
Marc Empey and Heidi Homme

17:39.750 --> 17:41.250
on a family retreat.

17:41.250 --> 17:44.083
They each have two daughters
from previous marriages.

17:44.083 --> 17:45.583
Kinda like "The Brady Bunch."
- "Brady Bunch."

17:45.583 --> 17:48.000
- Yeah.
- They look so sweet.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.042
- She's limited
on most seafood.

17:50.042 --> 17:52.000
- That's about as wild
as it's gonna get.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.583
We've got no weirdos.

17:54.583 --> 17:57.083
They want to take advantage
of all the water toys

17:57.083 --> 17:58.708
that are on the yacht.
- Roger that.

17:58.708 --> 18:00.875
- And they would like
an all-white dinner party.

18:00.875 --> 18:02.083
- Love.

18:02.083 --> 18:04.542
- And we have a new
deckhand coming.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.875
- Oh, really?
- Be here in the morning.

18:06.875 --> 18:08.542
Kyle Adam Dixon.

18:08.542 --> 18:10.000
- That's a very artistic
profile pic.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.583
- Oh, wow.
- Staring off into a horizon.

18:12.583 --> 18:13.958
- And what is that
in his right hand?

18:13.958 --> 18:15.292
- It's an apple.
- A happy napple.

18:15.292 --> 18:16.792
It's an apple.

18:16.792 --> 18:18.792
- He is a little green.
- I can work with green.

18:18.792 --> 18:20.958
- He does have some
white boat experience.

18:20.958 --> 18:23.583
Not a lot, but the labor pool
when you don't have

18:23.583 --> 18:25.958
a lot of time to waste
gets smaller and smaller.

18:25.958 --> 18:27.792
- Either he's got
the best sense of humor ever,

18:27.792 --> 18:30.958
or he's weird.
- Let's go to work.

18:30.958 --> 18:34.042
- Nico, Lauren, you wanna come
down to my cabin for just a sec?

18:34.042 --> 18:36.875
- Copy.

18:36.875 --> 18:39.292
- Uh, so yeah, we will be
getting our new deckhand.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.375
He's former British Army.
He's pretty green.

18:41.375 --> 18:43.250
- Is he?
- Yeah.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.125
- If he accepts that he's green,
then it'll be fine,

18:45.125 --> 18:47.042
but if he's green with attitude,
then we're gonna have a problem.

18:47.042 --> 18:48.750
- Well, he's either gonna be
a nob or he's not.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.750
- Yeah.
- We'll see.

18:52.167 --> 18:54.125
- What's going on?

18:55.792 --> 18:58.083
- I know something's wrong.
I know her so well.

19:07.292 --> 19:08.833
- What's she doing?

19:08.833 --> 19:11.167
- She just sent me a voice mail,
freaked out.

19:11.167 --> 19:13.333
- What?
- 'Cause she, like, was like,

19:13.333 --> 19:15.458
"Oh, okay, bye.
Love ya."

19:15.458 --> 19:18.333
And she was like, "F---.
Like, I said love."

19:18.333 --> 19:20.333
There's a difference
between "love ya"

19:20.333 --> 19:23.333
and "I love you."

19:23.333 --> 19:25.625
- Yeah, yeah.
- Huge.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.833
- I'm thrilled to bits
that Kate's happy with Ro.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.000
I think being in love
takes a certain maturity.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.542
And I'm not sure that
I've ever really been there.

19:34.542 --> 19:36.792
It's when they look
into your eyes

19:36.792 --> 19:39.208
and say, "I love you."

19:39.208 --> 19:42.458
That's when you know
you're truly buggered.

19:42.458 --> 19:45.625
- That's when you know it's
about to go downhill real fast.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.042
- Real quick.

19:50.708 --> 19:52.708
- Like that.

19:52.708 --> 19:55.042
We'd like four 50/50
each cup, okay?

19:55.042 --> 19:58.625
- But we don't want to put
anyone with 49 and, you know,

19:58.625 --> 20:01.042
"Oh, f---."

20:01.042 --> 20:02.375
The number one rule
of yachting

20:02.375 --> 20:04.458
is just don't screw
the crew.

20:04.458 --> 20:06.667
When you start getting feelings
for someone,

20:06.667 --> 20:08.958
it's like, "Ugh, sh--."
It's confusing.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.208
- That PK's gone
right to the dome, isn't it?

20:11.208 --> 20:13.375
Yeah.

20:18.375 --> 20:19.875
- I'd wear something
long-sleeve

20:19.875 --> 20:21.083
'cause it's gonna be cold
on the way back.

20:21.083 --> 20:22.875
- Wow, look at you
all dolled up.

20:22.875 --> 20:24.208
- Look at you.
- Huh, you look nice.

20:24.208 --> 20:25.833
- You look very nice.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.917
- We're gonna have
such a good night tonight.

20:27.917 --> 20:29.750
- About to go and get...

20:29.750 --> 20:31.583
- The girls are all
in black tonight.

20:31.583 --> 20:33.917
- Ciao.

20:33.917 --> 20:36.875
- Oh, we're going to sit here.
Yeah.

20:36.875 --> 20:39.708
- Where are you going?

20:46.417 --> 20:48.875
And it looks like--
Yeah.

20:48.875 --> 20:52.750
- Currently my relationship
status is, uh, undefined.

20:52.750 --> 20:55.750
Before I left, I was talking
to someone back home,

20:55.750 --> 20:57.417
but they don't call me Freako
for nothing.

20:57.417 --> 20:58.750
There's a reason.

21:15.125 --> 21:17.250
- I honestly can't figure out
what's going on

21:17.250 --> 21:18.875
with Nico and Lauren.
Like, are they friends?

21:18.875 --> 21:20.208
Are they more than friends?

21:20.208 --> 21:21.792
Should they be
more than friends?

21:21.792 --> 21:25.208
I think it's kind of hard
for them to even decide.

21:32.625 --> 21:34.125
- We're here.
- Ooh.

21:34.125 --> 21:36.542
- Off the boat.
- Thank you.

21:36.542 --> 21:37.958
- Off the boat.
- Thank you.

21:37.958 --> 21:40.458
- Go for it.
- Lauren.

21:40.458 --> 21:41.833
- I'm gonna help you
anyways.

21:41.833 --> 21:43.583
- Oh, f---.

21:45.125 --> 21:46.750
- Good evening,
welcome to The Rock Cafe.

21:46.750 --> 21:48.833
- Ooh, lobster tank.
- Just look at those spines.

21:48.833 --> 21:50.167
- So pretty.

21:50.167 --> 21:51.625
- Ooh, it is nice here,
isn't it?

21:55.000 --> 21:56.333
- I'll take a gin and tonic.

21:56.333 --> 21:58.083
- That sounds really good,
actually.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.667
- Can I have a vodka,
fresh lime, and soda water?

22:00.667 --> 22:02.667
- What kind of apps
are we into, guys? Anything?

22:02.667 --> 22:04.125
- Bruschetta.
- Okay.

22:04.125 --> 22:06.417
- Easy to share.
- Em, you want to split one?

22:06.417 --> 22:08.625
- Yeah.

22:08.625 --> 22:10.250
- Let's get it on.

22:10.250 --> 22:12.000
- I'm actually good
for drink, thank you.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.292
- You're not getting
a drink?

22:14.292 --> 22:15.333
- What?

22:19.125 --> 22:20.458
- I'm putting you in charge.

22:20.458 --> 22:22.208
If she comes,
that with fettuccine.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.667
- Sure.

22:25.167 --> 22:27.250
- Well...

22:29.125 --> 22:32.292
Sit down here.
Have a laugh.

22:32.292 --> 22:35.333
It's actually really nice
in here.

22:35.333 --> 22:38.042
- Nico's coming in hot,
and I respect that.

22:38.042 --> 22:40.708
But this is like
the tortoise and the hare.

22:40.708 --> 22:44.375
I'm the tortoise.
I'm gonna play the long game.

22:44.375 --> 22:46.708
- Hey, baby.
Oh, cheeky.

22:46.708 --> 22:49.708
- That looks beautiful.
- I'll share, guys.

22:49.708 --> 22:52.208
- Thank you.
Amazing.

22:52.208 --> 22:55.042
- Yeah.
Amazing.

22:55.042 --> 22:58.000
- How's your food?
- Really impressive.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.625
- What'd you get?

23:01.375 --> 23:03.083
- You got the calamari again.
Clever.

23:03.083 --> 23:04.500
- Yeah.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.167
- What the f---?

23:06.167 --> 23:07.917
I don't know what's
going on with Lauren.

23:14.542 --> 23:16.583
- Yeah.

23:16.583 --> 23:19.583
- I'll lead the way, boys.
Let's make bad decisions.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.542
- No, come with me.
- No, really.

23:22.542 --> 23:25.083
- Don't sulk.

23:25.083 --> 23:26.500
- What do you think?

23:30.417 --> 23:32.042
I say something,
and she just ignores me.

23:33.917 --> 23:35.750
- I know something's wrong.
I know her energy.

23:35.750 --> 23:39.000
I know her so well.
- Well, she likes you, man.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.583
So just--just trust me
on this, um...

23:41.583 --> 23:44.458
- Ugh, Lauren,
Lauren, Lauren.

23:44.458 --> 23:46.958
I feel so bad for her that
I don't have those feelings,

23:46.958 --> 23:48.958
and the last thing
I want to do is hurt her.

23:48.958 --> 23:51.958
- This type of emotion will just
blow over, and she'll get it.

23:51.958 --> 23:53.625
- I would never want
to hurt her.

23:53.625 --> 23:55.125
- All right, big guy.
- Come on, let's go.

23:55.125 --> 23:56.625
- We're gonna make sure
you have fun.

23:56.625 --> 23:57.792
Let's just get
in a better place--

23:57.792 --> 23:58.958
- I'm not gonna have
fun tonight.

23:58.958 --> 24:00.458
- Yeah, you are.
Look at me.

24:00.458 --> 24:01.792
- What do you mean
if they're having fun?

24:01.792 --> 24:02.792
- You know what
I'm talking about.

24:02.792 --> 24:04.292
- Who? Him and Emily?

24:04.292 --> 24:05.292
- Lis--I don't want
to talk about it.

24:05.292 --> 24:07.292
- No, no, no, no.

24:07.292 --> 24:10.125
- CocoMaya,
Asian Latino fusion.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.792
- Nico and I are still
getting to know each other,

24:21.792 --> 24:23.917
but he's a very interesting
character,

24:23.917 --> 24:25.792
and he's quite attractive.

24:25.792 --> 24:28.500
- Nico! Nico!

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
- I feel, like, embarrassed
within myself

24:51.000 --> 24:52.667
that I thought we were
on the same page,

24:52.667 --> 24:54.167
and then now he's flirting
with Emily,

24:54.167 --> 24:55.333
and I just had no idea
that was even

24:55.333 --> 24:56.833
anything on his mind.

24:56.833 --> 24:58.958
It just--
it's painful to watch, really.

25:04.333 --> 25:05.625
Like...

25:16.208 --> 25:17.542
Okay.

25:21.167 --> 25:22.458
- Dude.

25:35.708 --> 25:37.125
- F---.

25:41.208 --> 25:42.375
- Oops.

25:49.208 --> 25:52.083
I disapprove of anyone
making moves on people

25:52.083 --> 25:54.333
when they have
other connections.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.083
I love you all.

26:03.417 --> 26:04.750
- Good evening.

26:18.250 --> 26:19.750
- Yeah.

26:22.250 --> 26:24.208
- All right, off.
- Okay, sounds good.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.083
- We need to get off.
- Lauren, you good?

26:29.583 --> 26:32.458
- Good night, guys.
- Good night, hon.

26:36.583 --> 26:38.458
What?

26:40.792 --> 26:42.750
What?

26:43.958 --> 26:47.375
No, Nico, no.

26:57.042 --> 26:59.125
I go in my room,
Nico knocks on my door.

26:59.125 --> 27:01.625
And he's like, "Come here."
And I'm like, "Oh, what? What?"

27:01.625 --> 27:03.208
Like, "What do you have
to tell me?"

27:03.208 --> 27:04.958
He just tried to kiss me.
He just tried...

27:04.958 --> 27:07.958
Are you f---ing kidding me?

27:07.958 --> 27:09.458
- I think he's just confused.

27:11.792 --> 27:14.500
- Come in.

27:14.500 --> 27:15.875
Hello.

27:21.625 --> 27:23.292
- This is your other deckhand.

27:23.292 --> 27:24.667
- I was on motor yacht "Milo."
I spent a bit of time

27:24.667 --> 27:26.000
in Monaco
and the south of France.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.500
I've been doing
offshore suppling,

27:27.500 --> 27:28.500
working on fishing trawlers
since then.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.000
- What?

27:30.000 --> 27:31.333
- We're not in Kansas anymore.
- No.

27:40.500 --> 27:42.083
- He just tried to kiss me.
He just tried to...

27:42.083 --> 27:44.833
Are you f---ing kidding me?

27:44.833 --> 27:47.333
- I don't--I'm not that kind of
girl, and you got a girlfriend.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.042
- Oh, really?
- What?

27:51.167 --> 27:54.250
- Kelley told me
you had a girlfriend.

27:58.208 --> 28:00.875
- I'm going to bed.
Good night.

28:00.875 --> 28:03.167
- I think he's just confused.

28:15.792 --> 28:17.875
- All crew, all crew,
anybody in the crew mess

28:17.875 --> 28:20.875
who can help me
with provisions?

28:23.167 --> 28:26.875
- I hate provisions so much.

28:26.875 --> 28:28.458
- I don't want to see Nico
this morning.

28:28.458 --> 28:29.792
I don't want to talk
about it.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.458
I don't want him
to give me that look

28:31.458 --> 28:33.208
that's like, "Hey, you okay?"
It's like I do--

28:33.208 --> 28:36.750
I just want--let's just get up
and just go to work.

28:36.750 --> 28:38.917
- I don't know when
our new deckhand is showing up.

28:38.917 --> 28:41.417
I thought he was gonna
be here at 8:00.

28:43.750 --> 28:47.083
- Hiya.
Do you want to do a cover?

28:47.083 --> 28:48.917
- Sweating out
the toxins.

28:48.917 --> 28:50.250
- You were pretty sauced up.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.333
- Woke up,
still had my clothes on.

28:52.333 --> 28:54.000
Didn't have anyone else
in my bed.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.417
- You almost did.

28:55.417 --> 28:57.083
- Yeah, I tried making out
with everyone.

28:57.083 --> 28:59.708
- There was only Nico up there,
but he was so drunk.

28:59.708 --> 29:02.417
And then we came down
to the crew area,

29:02.417 --> 29:05.083
and he tried to kiss me.
- What?

29:05.083 --> 29:07.417
- He tried to kiss me.
- No.

29:07.417 --> 29:10.250
- Yes, as soon as we got back.
- As soon as you got back?

29:10.250 --> 29:12.583
- Yes.
His name's Freako.

29:12.583 --> 29:14.542
But I know that's not
who he is.

29:14.542 --> 29:16.417
He doesn't--he's not, like,
a bad guy.

29:16.417 --> 29:17.917
He's not trying
to, like, play us all.

29:17.917 --> 29:20.125
He just wanted
to get a little kiss.

29:20.125 --> 29:22.417
- I thought he was getting on
really well with Lauren

29:22.417 --> 29:23.625
on the exterior as well.

29:23.625 --> 29:25.958
- I don't know
what the deal is there.

29:25.958 --> 29:29.458
- I just want to kinda clarify
where we stand,

29:29.458 --> 29:31.250
and I don't want to hurt
her feelings ever, you know.

29:31.250 --> 29:32.792
I care about her a lot.
- Yeah.

29:32.792 --> 29:34.958
- Just not in a sexual way,
you know.

29:34.958 --> 29:36.375
- You gotta be real careful
with that.

29:36.375 --> 29:37.625
When Lauren and Nico
work together,

29:37.625 --> 29:39.125
they're like best friends.

29:39.125 --> 29:41.208
And for a girl to act that way
around a guy,

29:41.208 --> 29:44.792
no matter how cool she says
she is and how she's a bro,

29:44.792 --> 29:47.125
she's not.
Like, girls catch feelings.

29:47.125 --> 29:48.875
As long as it doesn't
affect work,

29:48.875 --> 29:50.625
I'm gonna let y'all handle it.
- Yeah, yeah, no.

29:50.625 --> 29:53.208
I mean, there's no need for it
to affect our work,

29:53.208 --> 29:54.792
and it's not going to.

29:54.792 --> 29:58.667
- Like, what was he thinking?
- Freako Nico.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.833
- How's it going?
- Great.

30:01.833 --> 30:03.833
- Isn't it great?
- I know.

30:03.833 --> 30:05.667
- I couldn't wait to get out
of bed today, it's so great.

30:05.667 --> 30:08.083
- I jumped out like this,
"Hello, good morning."

30:09.833 --> 30:11.417
Sarcastic.

30:21.083 --> 30:22.500
- Hi, pal, how you doing?
- Good, how are you?

30:22.500 --> 30:24.000
- Kyle.
- Kelley.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.750
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

30:25.750 --> 30:27.292
- Is the Captain about?
- Yeah, you're the new deckhand,

30:27.292 --> 30:28.500
I'm guessing.
- Yeah, I believe so, yeah.

30:28.500 --> 30:29.625
- All right.
Come on, follow me.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.583
- Captain.
- How are you?

30:31.583 --> 30:34.750
- I'm all right, how are you?
- I'm good. Welcome aboard.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.458
My view on beards,
obviously I have one.

30:36.458 --> 30:37.958
I like 'em short and trimmed
and well-groomed.

30:37.958 --> 30:40.417
- Yeah.
- So you haven't done much

30:40.417 --> 30:42.708
white boat work, huh?

30:42.708 --> 30:44.458
For a while.
- Mm-hmm.

30:44.458 --> 30:46.792
- I spent a bit of time in
Monaco and the south of France.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.500
- What?
That's a crazy British accent,

30:51.500 --> 30:53.167
ya wanker.

30:53.167 --> 30:55.292
- We're starting out right away
with a charter on board

30:55.292 --> 30:57.333
in about three hours.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.667
So if you want to take him down,
get him settled in,

30:59.667 --> 31:01.375
and then put him to work.
- All right, will do, Captain.

31:01.375 --> 31:03.125
- Cheers.

31:03.125 --> 31:04.458
We're not in Kansas anymore.
- No.

31:06.167 --> 31:08.708
So working on a trawler,
it's a very dangerous job.

31:08.708 --> 31:11.792
So for me, getting
into yachting is better

31:11.792 --> 31:13.875
because, number one,
there's women on the boat.

31:13.875 --> 31:16.042
And, number two,
it's not deadly.

31:16.042 --> 31:19.042
So it kinda sums it up for me
that it's a better option.

31:19.042 --> 31:20.875
- This will be your cabin.
Nico's your roommate.

31:20.875 --> 31:22.542
He'll be on top.
- Yeah.

31:22.542 --> 31:24.375
- We'll change over
and then put you to work.

31:24.375 --> 31:27.667
- I'm happy with that. Awesome.
- All right, cool.

31:27.667 --> 31:29.542
Sierra, can I get his uniforms?
- You want the whole bag?

31:29.542 --> 31:32.083
- Yep. Thank you.
- Yeah?

31:32.083 --> 31:33.417
- Ah, it's Kelley.
Here you go, bud.

31:33.417 --> 31:34.833
- Awesome.
Cheers, pal.

31:36.875 --> 31:38.583
- Did you meet
the new deckhand, Captain?

31:38.583 --> 31:40.250
- Mm-hmm.
- And?

31:40.250 --> 31:42.417
- Way too early.
- Here's your radio.

31:42.417 --> 31:43.667
- Sweet.

31:45.375 --> 31:46.583
- Hi, you guys all right?
- Hi.

31:46.583 --> 31:48.417
- Kyle, nice to meet you.
- Apple?

31:49.708 --> 31:51.875
I got it for you.
- I'll take it.

31:51.875 --> 31:53.542
- What's the deal
with the CV photo?

31:53.542 --> 31:55.333
I want to know now.
- I'll explain it, so...

31:55.333 --> 31:57.917
I had a photo of me just posing
on a yacht with an apple,

31:57.917 --> 31:59.875
and I--I liked that one.
I'll give it a go.

31:59.875 --> 32:02.750
And here I am,
so maybe the apple worked.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.417
- Hey, yeah.
- I love it.

32:04.417 --> 32:07.792
- I can barely understand
one word he says,

32:07.792 --> 32:09.792
and I'm from England.
- I'm gonna crack on.

32:09.792 --> 32:12.042
- All right, man. Yeah.
- Awesome. Cheers, pal.

32:12.042 --> 32:14.125
- Stop by anytime, bro.

32:14.125 --> 32:15.583
- So this is
your other deckhand.

32:15.583 --> 32:16.625
- Hi.
- Hi, you all right?

32:16.625 --> 32:18.292
- Lauren.
- Yeah, Lauren.

32:18.292 --> 32:19.917
Nice to meet you. Hi, Kyle.
- Kyle. Absolute pleasure.

32:19.917 --> 32:23.958
- Where's Nico?
- I have no idea.

32:23.958 --> 32:25.958
- Hey, Em.
- Hello.

32:25.958 --> 32:30.625
- Um...I wanted to apologize
for my actions last night.

32:30.625 --> 32:33.292
I was--I think I drank
a little bit too much.

32:33.292 --> 32:34.917
It was a little bit
inappropriate.

32:34.917 --> 32:36.375
- I don't think it's
very fair that you

32:36.375 --> 32:38.375
try and make out with Sierra
and myself.

32:38.375 --> 32:40.083
- Yeah.
- None of us should be made

32:40.083 --> 32:41.250
to feel like you were just
trying to get

32:41.250 --> 32:42.583
with the easiest girl.
- Yeah.

32:42.583 --> 32:44.042
I'm really sorry about that.

32:44.042 --> 32:45.542
I kind of got caught up
in the fun,

32:45.542 --> 32:48.417
and Freako gets me in trouble
sometimes.

32:48.417 --> 32:49.833
- How's your head feeling
this morning?

32:49.833 --> 32:51.500
Yeah.

32:51.500 --> 32:52.792
It's getting a beating.

32:56.083 --> 32:58.333
- Has the boat lost a bit
of respect for Nico,

32:58.333 --> 32:59.833
out of interest?
- Yeah, kind of.

32:59.833 --> 33:01.833
- Really?

33:01.833 --> 33:04.167
- Yeah, 'cause he tried making
out with every stewardess.

33:04.167 --> 33:06.083
But you'll give him
extra respect for that,

33:06.083 --> 33:07.625
so I understand
why you're confused.

33:07.625 --> 33:09.667
- Yeah, I know.

33:09.667 --> 33:11.333
- Hey, man, how's it going?
- How you doing? You all right?

33:11.333 --> 33:12.583
- Yeah, Nico.
- Kyle. Absolute pleasure.

33:12.583 --> 33:13.833
- Kyle.
Nice to meet you as well.

33:13.833 --> 33:15.667
- Well, go ahead
and get with Nico.

33:15.667 --> 33:17.333
It's just a little tidy-up right
now before the guests get here.

33:17.333 --> 33:18.667
- All right.
Okay.

33:18.667 --> 33:20.667
- So where are you from?
- Manchester.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.417
- Oh, nice.
- I live in London.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.667
- Oh, my daughter
lives in London.

33:23.667 --> 33:25.333
- Your?
- Daughter.

33:25.333 --> 33:29.292
I met ex missus
quite rapidly on a pub crawl,

33:29.292 --> 33:31.167
and we had a child
unexpectedly.

33:31.167 --> 33:32.833
- Are you jet-lagged at all?

33:32.833 --> 33:35.375
- I'm all right.

33:35.375 --> 33:37.042
I FaceTimed my daughter
when I landed.

33:37.042 --> 33:39.375
I got to watch her eat raisins
for ten minutes today.

33:39.375 --> 33:40.625
That was--that was nice.

33:40.625 --> 33:42.542
So what do you want me
to do right now?

33:42.542 --> 33:44.375
- Maybe just, like, go over the
stainless just with a chamois,

33:44.375 --> 33:45.875
make sure there's no,
like, water spots.

33:45.875 --> 33:47.333
- Okay, and the chamois
are in that locker?

33:47.333 --> 33:48.958
- Um, yeah.
Check it out. Go through it.

33:48.958 --> 33:50.167
Check out the materials
that we got,

33:50.167 --> 33:51.167
and if you
have any questions--

33:51.167 --> 33:52.292
- Port side or starboard?

33:52.292 --> 33:53.833
- Starboard side, aft.
- Right.

33:57.875 --> 34:00.667
- It's just kind of weird
right now with Lauren.

34:00.667 --> 34:04.208
Just--we just
need to fix this.

34:06.708 --> 34:09.875
- These guys are not gluten free
or lactose intolerant.

34:09.917 --> 34:13.667
- No matter what, they're gonna
be better than the last group.

34:13.708 --> 34:14.875
- You gonna be ready
five, ten minutes?

34:14.917 --> 34:16.417
- Yeah.

34:16.417 --> 34:18.250
- I just want you to go
in the laz with Nico

34:18.250 --> 34:20.083
to open up all the hatches,
find every tool we've got,

34:20.083 --> 34:22.417
and make me a list.
- Yep.

34:22.417 --> 34:24.417
Nico, what a f---ing idiot.

34:25.917 --> 34:29.083
- She told him off
for trying to kiss her

34:29.125 --> 34:30.250
after he tried to kiss me.

34:30.250 --> 34:32.708
- What the f---?

34:32.750 --> 34:33.875
Not cool. Not cool.

34:36.958 --> 34:39.208
- I just hope everything's
all right with us.

34:39.250 --> 34:41.542
- I guess I want to know what
the f--- you were thinking.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.208
- She told him off
for trying to kiss her

34:48.250 --> 34:49.875
after he tried to kiss me.

34:49.917 --> 34:52.750
- What the f---?

34:52.792 --> 34:56.625
Boy, you did not make
any smart moves.

34:56.667 --> 34:58.542
I know Nico
was wasted last night,

34:58.583 --> 35:01.750
but I can't believe he tried
to kiss Emily and Sierra.

35:01.792 --> 35:03.958
He's just not the guy
that I thought he was.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.083
- Lauren.
- Yeah.

35:05.125 --> 35:06.458
- Game time.
- All right.

35:15.625 --> 35:17.792
- So what's up, chica?

35:17.792 --> 35:19.458
- Hey.
- How you feeling today?

35:19.500 --> 35:21.458
- Fine. You know.

35:21.458 --> 35:24.208
- Yeah, you know, I just hope
everything's all right with us.

35:24.250 --> 35:27.125
You seemed really stressed out,
like, you know, I--

35:27.125 --> 35:28.250
- Yeah, I guess I wanna know

35:28.292 --> 35:29.792
what the f---
you were thinking?

35:29.792 --> 35:32.083
- Just, you know,
f---ing alcohol, man.

35:32.125 --> 35:35.125
You know, I got super drunk.
- Yeah.

35:35.167 --> 35:36.500
- Yeah, we all were
pretty drunk,

35:36.542 --> 35:38.250
but when we sat at the table,

35:38.292 --> 35:40.083
you weren't really,
like, talking to me at all,

35:40.125 --> 35:42.958
so I just felt like maybe
I did something to upset you.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.625
You know, I don't want
anything to change.

35:44.667 --> 35:46.625
We work really well.
You know what I'm trying to say?

35:46.667 --> 35:48.000
- I know, yeah.
- You know?

35:48.042 --> 35:49.667
- It's a bit
of a smack in the face

35:49.667 --> 35:51.167
to know that you've
just been "friend zoned,"

35:51.208 --> 35:53.500
but I'm good at just
putting it aside

35:53.500 --> 35:54.917
and just hoping that
the feelings will just

35:54.958 --> 35:56.417
trickle away with time.

35:56.458 --> 35:58.083
We know where we stand.
We know how f---ing good

35:58.125 --> 36:00.000
we are together.
- I'm glad that we're okay.

36:00.042 --> 36:01.958
- We're good.
You can't get through us.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.750
We're good and we're sweet.

36:05.625 --> 36:06.958
- We're cool.

36:11.708 --> 36:13.333
- I'm sorry.
What was your name again?

36:13.375 --> 36:14.583
- Kyle.
- Kyle?

36:14.625 --> 36:16.667
What you doing?
- Ironing.

36:18.875 --> 36:20.542
- I don't mind.
It's just 'cause, uh, I thought

36:20.542 --> 36:21.875
you guys were a bit busy,
so I just thought I'd do it

36:21.875 --> 36:23.125
'cause I've got
some time to burn.

36:23.125 --> 36:24.708
- Okay, well--
- Unless you--

36:24.708 --> 36:25.708
do you wanna do it or--
- No, I'd love

36:25.708 --> 36:26.958
to see your skills, though,

36:26.958 --> 36:28.542
so I'll let you do
these one pants

36:28.542 --> 36:30.667
and maybe the captain's.

36:30.667 --> 36:32.625
- Oh, I can see this now.
Delegation.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.792
- Maybe.
- To delegate is to inspire.

36:34.792 --> 36:37.000
- That's a high honor
to iron the captain's pants.

36:40.792 --> 36:42.833
- Attention all crew,
we have 30 minutes

36:42.833 --> 36:44.708
until guest arrival.

36:47.458 --> 36:49.042
- I don't think your feet
have seen sunlight

36:49.042 --> 36:51.292
in, like, four years.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.792
That's a good-size boat.

36:53.792 --> 36:55.458
- All right, they're coming on.

36:56.875 --> 36:58.500
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

36:58.500 --> 36:59.750
Got a perfect day.
- Captain Lee.

36:59.750 --> 37:01.333
- Hello.
- Hi there. Welcome.

37:01.333 --> 37:02.542
- Hi. How are you?
Captain Lee.

37:02.542 --> 37:03.542
- I'm good. I'm Claire.

37:03.542 --> 37:04.917
- Megan.
- Hi.

37:04.917 --> 37:06.917
- Kelley.
- Nice to meet you, Kelley.

37:06.917 --> 37:08.917
- Marc, Heidi,
welcome aboard "Valor."

37:08.917 --> 37:10.875
We've got a lot of fun
in store for you.

37:10.875 --> 37:12.708
Kate will show you
to your rooms,

37:12.708 --> 37:14.667
and we'll get out of here
and get this party going.

37:14.667 --> 37:16.333
- All right, whoo!
Ready.

37:16.333 --> 37:17.750
- Right this way.

37:17.750 --> 37:19.083
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

37:19.083 --> 37:21.000
So this is the main salon.
- Ooh.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.417
- This boat was recently refit,
so all of this is brand-new.

37:24.417 --> 37:27.500
This is our master, and
the bathroom is quite large.

37:27.500 --> 37:28.833
- I'll just load 'em
up here with you?

37:28.833 --> 37:30.250
- Yeah.

37:30.250 --> 37:32.500
- There's a bathtub,
a huge shower.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.042
- You don't get that everywhere.

37:35.750 --> 37:37.708
- And then we're gonna go
to sun deck.

37:37.708 --> 37:39.292
- Oh, wow.
- So we've got a Jacuzzi.

37:39.292 --> 37:41.292
And then we call this
the bunny pad.

37:41.292 --> 37:43.958
It's great for laying out
while we're under way.

37:43.958 --> 37:45.583
- Gorgeous.

37:45.583 --> 37:48.458
- Okay, let's go.
Bow to stern starting now.

37:48.458 --> 37:50.542
Let's go ahead
and get the bowlines off.

37:50.542 --> 37:52.083
- The spring line,
you're gonna drop.

37:52.083 --> 37:53.625
The breast line,
you're gonna bring up.

37:53.625 --> 37:55.792
- That goes to the mom.
This goes to the dad.

37:55.792 --> 37:57.042
- So it's like drop
spring first

37:57.042 --> 37:58.292
and just pull that
one in, yeah?

37:58.292 --> 38:00.125
- Go ahead and uncoil it off.

38:00.125 --> 38:02.583
- I got one line standing here.
Let's get it off.

38:02.583 --> 38:04.792
- Okay, Cap.
All lines clear astern.

38:04.792 --> 38:06.292
- All right,
we're coming out of here.

38:06.292 --> 38:07.583
- This is awesome.

38:07.583 --> 38:08.583
- Yeah, it's ridiculous.

38:08.583 --> 38:10.625
- Kyle was sent from heaven.

38:12.750 --> 38:15.125
- We're all meshing very well;
we're doing our job well.

38:15.125 --> 38:16.417
It's awesome.

38:16.417 --> 38:18.125
- Can I get anybody a refill

38:18.125 --> 38:19.792
or something to drink
besides champagne?

38:19.792 --> 38:22.000
- A Captain and Sprite
for me, please.

38:24.417 --> 38:25.667
- How hungry are y'all?

38:25.667 --> 38:27.000
You want to do lunch
around 2:00?

38:27.000 --> 38:28.458
- Can I get another mojito,
please?

38:28.458 --> 38:29.833
- Mojito, yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

38:29.833 --> 38:31.250
- As long as they have
cocktails, they can do--

38:31.250 --> 38:32.958
They don't care.
- My kind of people.

38:32.958 --> 38:35.750
- I think this primary
has accepted his fate

38:35.750 --> 38:38.292
that he's gonna be surrounded
by drunk women all the time,

38:38.292 --> 38:40.167
and he handles it with grace.

38:41.917 --> 38:43.500
Ben.
- Yes.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.125
- I asked them if they would
like lunch around 2:00.

38:45.125 --> 38:47.083
Is that good for you?

38:47.083 --> 38:49.167
- Okay. So they're not like,
"Oh, we're really hungry" or--

38:49.167 --> 38:50.833
- No, they're like,
"Hey, who needs food

38:50.833 --> 38:52.500
when you've got drinks?"

38:52.500 --> 38:54.500
- She wants to try mojitos,
but she hates mojitos.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.167
- It tastes like salad
in your drink, bro.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.500
- No, it doesn't.
- Why do I want to eat my drink?

38:59.583 --> 39:02.125
- No, thank you.

39:02.125 --> 39:04.208
- Hi, Kyle. I'm Sierra.
I know we met earlier.

39:04.208 --> 39:05.875
- Been very busy, so I haven't
bothered you all day.

39:05.875 --> 39:07.667
- Yeah, I felt like
I was dying earlier,

39:07.667 --> 39:09.625
and then I got really busy.

39:09.625 --> 39:12.500
Busy's good, though; I feel
like it makes the time go by

39:12.500 --> 39:14.333
and, like, the way these
charters are set up,

39:14.333 --> 39:15.833
like, it just flies.

39:15.833 --> 39:17.375
- So where's all,
like, the treats?

39:17.375 --> 39:18.708
Where's the fat food?

39:18.708 --> 39:21.125
- The fat food?
Oh, you can, like, face me.

39:21.125 --> 39:23.042
Face me and then, like, under

39:23.042 --> 39:24.875
that cabinet, like, under--

39:24.875 --> 39:27.125
- We just met, Sierra; you're
making me bend over already.

39:27.125 --> 39:28.542
- No, no, you can just,
like, lean.

39:28.542 --> 39:30.042
- Sierra's looking nice.

39:30.042 --> 39:31.792
She's just exactly what I need.

39:33.375 --> 39:35.375
She's very, like, cold weather,
like, Norwegian.

39:35.375 --> 39:37.000
And I'm a Viking.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.875
So she can come sailing with me
anytime.

39:42.333 --> 39:44.417
- If you and Claire got in
a fight, like a fistfight--

39:44.417 --> 39:46.083
- Like a fistfight? I feel like
we're both scrappy as f---.

39:47.583 --> 39:49.750
- So, Ben, what are you
making for lunch?

39:49.750 --> 39:51.333
- Asparagus salad
with roast beet,

39:51.333 --> 39:53.583
goat cheese,
Mediterranean sea bass,

39:53.583 --> 39:56.250
and I'm gonna go in strong
with a potato salad.

39:56.250 --> 39:58.417
- Yeah.
- Trufflize the hell out of it.

39:58.417 --> 40:01.083
- Oh, boy.
- Give me three shots.

40:01.083 --> 40:02.333
- Roger, three shots.

40:05.750 --> 40:08.417
- Lock it down at three.
You're good.

40:08.417 --> 40:09.833
- Those tie up at the top there
like that?

40:09.833 --> 40:11.875
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, perfect.

40:11.875 --> 40:14.542
- Kyle seems really cool.
- So nice.

40:14.542 --> 40:16.167
Very nice.

40:16.167 --> 40:18.917
- Somebody needs to get
lucky on this boat.

40:21.042 --> 40:23.083
- There's a lot of sexual
tension on the boat.

40:23.083 --> 40:24.833
Emily should just take
her pick.

40:24.833 --> 40:26.750
Someone. Whatever.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.458
All of them.
I don't care.

40:32.875 --> 40:34.708
- Whoo!

40:34.708 --> 40:36.250
- You all right, Kyle?
- Is he all right?

40:36.250 --> 40:37.458
What happened?
- You all right?

40:37.458 --> 40:39.292
- F---ing hell.
- Oh, my God.

40:39.292 --> 40:41.208
- Holy sh--.

40:41.208 --> 40:42.458
- F---.

40:50.458 --> 40:52.792
- Hey, Kyle, go throw on your
swim shorts and rash guard.

40:52.792 --> 40:54.125
- So just to let you know,

40:54.125 --> 40:55.625
Ben's starting
to platter up lunch,

40:55.625 --> 40:57.208
and I've got the table set
downstairs

40:57.208 --> 40:59.042
whenever you guys are ready.
- Okay, terrific.

40:59.042 --> 41:00.292
Downstairs for lunch.

41:00.292 --> 41:02.625
- Get started
on getting the toys in.

41:02.625 --> 41:04.542
- We're already on it,
Captain.

41:04.542 --> 41:05.958
- Thank you, sir.

41:05.958 --> 41:07.167
- No, we gotta go out this way,
right?

41:12.958 --> 41:14.167
- That's the way.
- There it is.

41:14.167 --> 41:16.000
- Got you.
This is the first time

41:16.000 --> 41:17.292
I've ever been
to the Caribbean,

41:17.292 --> 41:19.792
and I'm so excited to be here.

41:19.792 --> 41:21.292
I'm in the BVIs, man.
You know?

41:21.292 --> 41:23.000
And I'm getting somewhere
in my life.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.667
It's great.

41:24.667 --> 41:26.792
- Would you like
some potato salad?

41:26.792 --> 41:28.167
- Yes, I would.
Great.

41:28.167 --> 41:30.333
- Goat cheese, kiwi,
roasted beets.

41:30.333 --> 41:32.458
- Ooh, beets. I see beets.
- Goat cheese.

41:32.458 --> 41:34.000
- Ben gets an A on this one.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.833
- Bomb.com.

41:35.833 --> 41:37.167
- Kids are messed up.

41:38.250 --> 41:39.250
- Who raised us?
- Not me.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.792
- It's actually
kind of surprising to me

41:42.792 --> 41:45.333
that these parents
are encouraging and allowing

41:45.333 --> 41:48.000
their daughters
to drink so much.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.208
- Kit Kats and Coors Light.
Killing it.

41:51.208 --> 41:52.875
- I want them
to remember their vacation,

41:52.875 --> 41:55.542
so maybe it's time
we start serving them

41:55.542 --> 41:57.333
a little bit lighter drinks.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.958
- You like it.
You like it.

42:01.375 --> 42:03.042
- Look at that.

42:03.042 --> 42:04.708
Whoo!

42:06.042 --> 42:07.875
- So one of those in each bag

42:07.875 --> 42:09.542
and then we'll give you these
lighter ones afterwards.

42:09.542 --> 42:13.042
- All right.

42:13.042 --> 42:17.208
- F---.
- You all right, Kyle?

42:17.208 --> 42:18.500
- Is he all right?
What happened?

42:18.500 --> 42:19.958
- You all right?
- F---. F---ing hell.

42:19.958 --> 42:22.333
- Oh, my God.
- Holy sh--.

42:22.333 --> 42:23.667
Did he dislocate his shoulder?

42:25.625 --> 42:27.167
- Next on "Below Deck"...

42:27.167 --> 42:29.542
- Oh, Ro's coming to visit.

42:29.542 --> 42:31.042
- Who the f--- is that?

42:31.042 --> 42:33.417
What?

42:33.417 --> 42:35.667
- Oh, my God, Ben is, like,
hating his life right now.

42:35.667 --> 42:37.042
- Come on.

42:38.917 --> 42:40.208
- I need to cool off.

42:40.208 --> 42:41.917
- Whoa!

42:41.917 --> 42:43.667
- I like my girls tiny,

42:43.667 --> 42:45.333
like, "Oh,
I'm gonna protect you."

42:45.333 --> 42:47.208
- What are you doing?
Kelley.

42:47.208 --> 42:49.250
- You do realize, though,
that I find you very attractive?

42:49.250 --> 42:52.083
You're stunning,
absolutely beautiful.

42:53.583 --> 42:55.250
Kelley, Kelley, Lee.

42:55.250 --> 42:57.167
I've been looking
at dirty f---ing windows

42:57.167 --> 42:58.750
for three f---ing days.
- That's all inside.

42:58.750 --> 43:00.417
- Do you really want
to go to war on this?

43:00.417 --> 43:02.000
I want it done.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.875
- They're properly
sauced up now, right?

43:03.875 --> 43:06.083
- They're drinking at a rate
that even impresses

43:06.083 --> 43:08.167
and scares me.

43:08.167 --> 43:09.542
- Oh!

43:09.542 --> 43:11.417
- Whoo!
- You guys are over the reef.

43:12.917 --> 43:15.917
- For more info, go to:
