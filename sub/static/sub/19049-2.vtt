00:11.303 --> 00:12.470
Hey.

00:12.538 --> 00:13.905
Hi.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.606
Hey.

00:15.674 --> 00:18.309
Come back to bed and snuggle with me.

00:18.377 --> 00:22.547
Oh... I wish I could, but
I got to go to work.

00:22.614 --> 00:24.348
But there's cab fare
on the nightstand.

00:24.416 --> 00:26.651
That's the third morning
in a row you've done that.

00:26.718 --> 00:28.052
We're married.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.088
I'm already home, silly.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.122
Right. You're here.

00:31.190 --> 00:32.390
We're married, and that's cool.

00:32.458 --> 00:33.357
I'm psyched, dude.

00:33.425 --> 00:34.125
That's great.

00:34.193 --> 00:35.326
So you're... Yeah, okay.

00:35.394 --> 00:38.062
Well, you know, you could use the
cab fare though to get to work.

00:38.130 --> 00:39.230
Oh, I don't work.

00:39.298 --> 00:40.031
Oh, oh, okay.

00:40.099 --> 00:41.933
I just thought maybe you weren't
going to work recently because

00:42.000 --> 00:43.668
we were going through a little
bit of a honeymoon phase.

00:43.735 --> 00:45.636
But you're saying that
you don't have a job.

00:45.704 --> 00:46.404
No job.

00:46.472 --> 00:48.139
No job at all? Wow.

00:48.207 --> 00:49.340
All yours.

00:49.408 --> 00:50.808
All mine.

00:50.876 --> 00:52.076
All mine all the time.

00:52.144 --> 00:53.211
All the time.

00:53.278 --> 00:54.745
Okay. Except on my work days.

00:54.813 --> 00:58.483
I do have to go to work, you know, so...
That's cool, though.

00:58.550 --> 01:00.852
You can just hang out here, I
guess, and sort of get used to

01:00.919 --> 01:03.688
the lay of the land or whatever...
Although, don't-don't go

01:03.755 --> 01:04.589
snooping around too much.

01:04.656 --> 01:06.424
'Cause this has all happened
really fast and I really

01:06.492 --> 01:08.559
haven't had time to do a pass yet.

01:08.627 --> 01:10.261
Don't-don't look in those drawers.

01:10.329 --> 01:11.562
What's in those drawers?

01:11.630 --> 01:13.331
My sex tapes.

01:13.398 --> 01:13.998
Yeah.

01:14.066 --> 01:15.366
All right, I got to go to work.

01:15.434 --> 01:17.702
I love you.

01:17.769 --> 01:21.038
I love you, too, Maureen.

02:02.458 --> 02:04.893
Okay, look, dude,
all I'm saying is that you

02:04.961 --> 02:07.896
started off our domestic
partnership on some very shaky,

02:07.964 --> 02:09.497
very bullshitty ground, dude.

02:09.565 --> 02:13.001
And I'm saying, Charlie,
you should get over it, move on.

02:13.069 --> 02:15.237
You signed the prenup, case closed.

02:15.304 --> 02:17.239
You told me it was
the phone bill, man.

02:17.306 --> 02:19.307
Of course I signed it.

02:19.308 --> 02:22.877
Why would you think that you
needed to sign a phone bill.

02:22.945 --> 02:26.548
I can't keep track of our
financial comings and goings.

02:26.616 --> 02:30.352
When he hands me something to sign and
it's about money and papers, I sign it.

02:30.419 --> 02:31.853
Hey-oh.

02:31.921 --> 02:34.289
Look who got a brand-new car.

02:34.357 --> 02:36.691
I'm still a little bit
confused as to why in the hell

02:36.759 --> 02:38.927
you two got married
in the first place.

02:38.995 --> 02:42.464
Charlie, gets health insurance
and I get diddly-squat.

02:42.531 --> 02:43.398
He's gonna get some perks.

02:43.466 --> 02:44.366
He doesn't trust me.

02:44.433 --> 02:46.501
Hey, why in the hell are you
bathing yourself in the sink?

02:46.569 --> 02:48.570
Because I don't
have a home anymore.

02:48.638 --> 02:50.305
So this is where I take a shower.

02:50.373 --> 02:51.406
This is where I live, Dennis.

02:52.642 --> 02:54.009
Texting me again.

02:54.076 --> 02:54.976
This is pathetic.

02:55.044 --> 02:56.244
Back me up on this, Dennis.

02:56.312 --> 02:58.747
You got a prenup with Maureen, right?

02:58.814 --> 03:00.181
Uh, no, I did not.

03:00.249 --> 03:01.082
Should I have?

03:02.385 --> 03:03.618
Should you have?

03:03.686 --> 03:04.919
You are screwed.

03:04.987 --> 03:06.288
Typical.

03:06.355 --> 03:07.956
This is so typical.

03:08.024 --> 03:10.492
My God, Dee, you clearly have
something you want to say.

03:10.559 --> 03:11.926
So let's just get it over with.

03:11.994 --> 03:12.761
Oh, no.

03:12.828 --> 03:13.795
No, it's no big deal.

03:13.863 --> 03:16.698
It's just Bill Ponderosa is like
obsessed with me now or something.

03:16.766 --> 03:18.533
I don't know, he's
texting me all the time.

03:18.601 --> 03:19.367
He calls me, like, nonstop.

03:19.435 --> 03:20.735
He bought me a new car.

03:20.803 --> 03:25.040
Dee, are you seriously bragging
about sleeping with a married man?

03:25.107 --> 03:27.442
Yeah, one second you're on your
high horse about how great

03:27.510 --> 03:29.444
marriage is, and now
you're destroying one?

03:29.512 --> 03:31.112
Well, I'm not the one who's married.

03:31.180 --> 03:31.913
I didn't do anything wrong.

03:31.981 --> 03:33.214
You let him buy you a car.

03:33.282 --> 03:35.283
Well, Frank, I'm not going
to go passing on free cars.

03:35.351 --> 03:38.453
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys, all
this talk about marriage and

03:38.521 --> 03:42.691
Dee being such a whore has got me
thinking... I never got a bachelor party.

03:42.758 --> 03:43.725
We should go to the strip club.

03:43.793 --> 03:45.727
Right now?

03:45.795 --> 03:47.195
Yeah, immediately.

03:47.263 --> 03:49.497
And since you would have been my
best man, you should probably

03:49.565 --> 03:54.769
throw it for me.

03:54.837 --> 03:57.339
Yeah, and I'm still pretty pissed about
you not throwing me a bachelor party.

03:57.406 --> 03:59.107
So this way I figure we'll be even.

03:59.175 --> 04:00.342
I'm ready for this.

04:00.409 --> 04:02.744
Being married to Charlie's
got me all confused.

04:02.812 --> 04:04.245
I got to get my hetero on.

That's it.

04:17.860 --> 04:18.459
Motorcycle?

04:18.527 --> 04:19.928
That's pretty...
Yeah, not like that, though.

04:19.995 --> 04:22.096
It's pretty good, but you got to use...

04:22.164 --> 04:22.931
...a little bit more shoulder.

04:22.998 --> 04:24.699
I like the way he's
doing it, actually.

04:24.767 --> 04:26.301
Yeah, 'cause I'm like,
I'm bending the bike.

04:26.369 --> 04:28.036
But that's not really
how drive a motorcycle.

04:28.104 --> 04:29.871
Yeah, but you're not really
driving a motorcycle.

04:29.939 --> 04:30.572
It's my thing, okay?

04:30.639 --> 04:31.239
All right.

04:31.307 --> 04:33.641
Well, if you're not going to take it
seriously, then don't... then don't do it.

04:33.709 --> 04:35.043
I feel like I was
doing it pretty good.

04:35.111 --> 04:36.511
I feel like you're
taking it too seriously.

04:36.579 --> 04:37.312
Let's not fight.

04:37.380 --> 04:37.979
It's a bachelor party.

04:38.047 --> 04:39.180
Oh, I got a text.

04:39.248 --> 04:40.882
I got a text from the woman.

04:40.950 --> 04:42.183
"Miss you."

04:42.251 --> 04:46.087
I'll just write, "Miss you, too.
Miss you, too."

04:46.155 --> 04:48.523
Now do I write the word "too" or
should I write the number two?

04:48.591 --> 04:50.725
What's the best way to do that
when we're texting back and forth?

04:50.793 --> 04:51.393
Who cares, dude?

04:51.460 --> 04:52.961
I'll do the word, I'll do the word.

04:53.028 --> 04:53.995
Okay, great.

04:54.063 --> 04:55.130
Frank, what's with the purse?

04:55.197 --> 04:56.865
It's my money bag.

04:56.932 --> 04:58.733
I'm gonna make it rain, baby.

04:58.801 --> 04:59.868
Whoa, hold on.

04:59.935 --> 05:00.769
Make it rain?

05:00.836 --> 05:02.504
What is that... you gonna
chuck money everywhere?

05:02.571 --> 05:03.204
Don't do that.

05:03.272 --> 05:04.372
Will you lighten up?

05:04.440 --> 05:05.273
I'd like to make it rain.

05:05.341 --> 05:06.374
Can I make it rain, Mac?

05:06.442 --> 05:07.342
Why are you asking me?

05:07.410 --> 05:09.744
Well, dude, 'cause I can't
fund my own bachelor party.

05:09.812 --> 05:11.012
That's just tacky.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.947
Fine.

05:13.015 --> 05:14.749
Excuse me. Hi.

05:14.817 --> 05:15.683
Hi.

05:15.751 --> 05:18.620
What is the recommended amount of
money for one to make it rain?

05:18.687 --> 05:19.788
I'd say at least a thousand.

05:19.855 --> 05:24.526
How much would it cost for this gentleman
and I to get a nice couple's dance?

05:24.593 --> 05:26.828
Sorry. You have to be
a couple for that.

05:26.896 --> 05:28.062
We are a couple.

05:28.130 --> 05:29.564
Charlie, documents.

05:29.632 --> 05:31.399
All right, this is
what it was all for.

05:31.467 --> 05:32.700
Mm-hmm.

05:32.768 --> 05:34.469
Look at this... we're married.

05:34.537 --> 05:36.805
Oh, you guys are cute.

05:36.872 --> 05:39.174
You're still going to
have to pay full price.

05:39.241 --> 05:40.108
Screw this.

05:40.176 --> 05:41.443
I'm gonna go make it rain.

05:41.510 --> 05:43.011
All right, well, hang on a second.

05:43.078 --> 05:43.978
Give me some money.

05:44.046 --> 05:45.880
Let's go, I'm your husband.

05:45.948 --> 05:47.882
Give me some money.

05:47.950 --> 05:50.418
♪ Ooh, don't say maybe... ♪

05:50.486 --> 05:51.586
There it is.

05:51.654 --> 05:52.520
What is this?

05:52.588 --> 05:54.756
I'm tightening the purse
strings on this relationship

05:54.824 --> 05:56.925
until there's a little
bit of give and take.

05:56.992 --> 05:58.259
You know what, keep your money.

05:58.327 --> 05:59.861
I don't need your little allowance.

05:59.929 --> 06:00.795
Hey, we'll see.

06:02.331 --> 06:03.665
"Miss you more."

06:03.732 --> 06:05.767
That's classic Maureen right there.

06:05.835 --> 06:13.942
She's always got to one-up
me "Miss you most."

06:14.009 --> 06:16.744
Most... can't get more
than most, right?

06:16.812 --> 06:18.947
So that should...
that should be the end of it, right?

06:19.014 --> 06:20.949
So, I hope so.

06:25.888 --> 06:27.055
Oh, man.

06:27.122 --> 06:28.590
You just cannot get enough, huh?

06:28.657 --> 06:31.159
Sorry for just showing
up, you know, but you weren't

06:31.227 --> 06:32.260
responding to my texts.

06:32.328 --> 06:33.595
Oh, I totally get it.

06:33.662 --> 06:35.964
Once you pop, you can't
stop, am I right?

06:37.132 --> 06:39.234
Actually, I came clean to my wife.

06:39.301 --> 06:40.935
And she kicked me out of the house.

06:41.003 --> 06:42.136
Ew. Ouch.

06:42.204 --> 06:42.871
Yeah.

06:42.938 --> 06:44.806
Bet you wish you could
take that one back.

06:44.874 --> 06:46.975
So I was thinking, maybe I
could stay here tonight.

06:47.042 --> 06:47.809
Oh.

06:47.877 --> 06:49.744
You are somewhat responsible for this.

06:49.812 --> 06:51.613
No. No, no, no, no.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.448
Can't you stay in a hotel or something.
Isn't that...?

06:53.516 --> 06:56.117
I would, but she froze my assets.

06:56.185 --> 06:57.385
Yikes.

06:57.453 --> 06:59.787
Shit's getting pretty
real for you, huh?

06:59.855 --> 07:04.325
But nonetheless, uh, I really, like I
said, I don't want you in my space.

07:04.393 --> 07:06.861
So there's got to be a lot of
other places that you could stay

07:06.929 --> 07:08.930
that aren't, you know, here.

07:08.998 --> 07:10.732
Dee, I gave you a car.

07:10.799 --> 07:13.568
You're gonna jam the
car in my face, huh?

07:13.636 --> 07:16.104
Come in.

07:18.407 --> 07:20.308
Thanks.

Hey... Hey...
What are you doing?

07:46.969 --> 07:48.736
It is 2:00 in the morning.

07:48.804 --> 07:50.371
I was sleeping, Dennis.

07:50.439 --> 07:51.172
That's cool.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.841
Well, you're up now, baby
girl, so let's do some shots.

07:53.909 --> 07:54.943
No, I don't drink.

07:55.010 --> 07:55.944
You know that.

07:56.011 --> 07:57.879
I think it makes people look ugly.

07:57.947 --> 08:01.149
I...
Maybe I should go to my room.

08:01.216 --> 08:02.650
That is not your room anymore.

08:02.718 --> 08:05.620
It is my craft studio, so
kindly stay out of there.

08:05.688 --> 08:06.287
What?!

08:06.355 --> 08:07.689
Don't freak out, dude.

08:07.756 --> 08:08.590
It's all good, dude.

08:08.657 --> 08:11.059
She turned it into her craft
studio where she makes terrible

08:11.126 --> 08:13.995
sweatshirts out of cats or...
puts cats in sweatshirts, and then...

08:14.063 --> 08:16.197
I'm, like, "Dude, what
the hell did you do?"

08:16.265 --> 08:18.399
Dennis, do not talk to me that way.

08:18.467 --> 08:19.167
I am your wife.

08:19.234 --> 08:21.336
Please show me some respect
in front of your friends.

08:21.403 --> 08:22.503
Uh, you know what?

08:22.571 --> 08:29.744

that Maureen Ponderosa.

What? What did you just say?

08:34.683 --> 08:36.884
I will divorce you, Maureen.

08:36.952 --> 08:37.619
I'll do it.

08:37.686 --> 08:38.553
Okay, you're drunk.

08:38.621 --> 08:40.121
Why don't we just go to bed...?

08:40.188 --> 08:41.222
I'm not drunk.

08:41.289 --> 08:44.726
I'm more sober than I've
ever been in my entire life.

08:44.793 --> 08:47.795
Okay, I'm a little bit drink.

08:47.863 --> 08:49.864
I'm totally drunk, but
my mind is sober.

08:49.932 --> 08:53.101
And my mind's telling me the
following: I don't love you, Maureen.

08:53.168 --> 08:54.235
I don't love you.

08:54.303 --> 08:55.536
I never loved you.

08:55.604 --> 08:57.605
You're annoying and you're strange.

08:57.673 --> 08:59.374
I don't know what to say.

08:59.441 --> 09:02.477
Don't say anything 'cause every time
you open your mouth, I'm, like, "Ugh!"

09:02.544 --> 09:03.845
It's like her breath...
Ugh!

09:03.912 --> 09:06.180
It's like always so bad.

09:06.248 --> 09:07.415
It's like a dead tooth.

09:07.483 --> 09:08.182
It's the dead tooth.

09:08.250 --> 09:09.517
I'm saying it now. I'll say it.

09:09.585 --> 09:10.485
You have a dead tooth.

09:10.552 --> 09:11.319
You realize that, right?

09:11.387 --> 09:14.088
And I hate it, and it's annoying!

09:14.156 --> 09:19.193
I want you and your boy toy
out of my apartment now!

09:19.928 --> 09:21.596
I'm the boy toy!

09:21.664 --> 09:23.231
You're my boy toy.

09:23.298 --> 09:27.268
You know, I'm not gonna
leave our apartment.

09:27.336 --> 09:28.970
Or should I say "my apartment,"

09:29.038 --> 09:29.837
'cause it's my apartment.

09:29.905 --> 09:30.872
Oh, yeah?

09:30.939 --> 09:35.343
How about if you guys don't leave, I call
the cops and I tell 'em you beat me?

09:35.411 --> 09:37.178
What in the hell are
you talking about?

09:37.246 --> 09:41.783
I didn't touch you.

09:41.850 --> 09:43.117
What...? What are you doing?

09:43.185 --> 09:43.885
What is that?

09:43.952 --> 09:45.286
I recognize that. What is that?

09:45.354 --> 09:47.655
<i>Oh, shit, that's from...
that's from Fear, dude.</i>

09:47.723 --> 09:48.556
Oh, that's Marky Mark.

09:48.624 --> 09:49.490
That's Marky Mark.

09:49.558 --> 09:50.692
That's what Marky Mark does.

09:50.759 --> 09:53.494
He does that, and then, um...
Oh, shit, and then the cops

09:53.562 --> 09:55.096
come, and then he...
Oh, and the police think that

09:55.164 --> 09:57.131
<i>William Petersen, the guy from CSI...
 Go. She means business.</i>

09:57.199 --> 09:57.799
<i>She means business.</i>

09:57.866 --> 09:59.801
<i>Shit! Oh, shit! Ah!</i>

10:07.715 --> 10:08.781
Oh, my God!

10:08.849 --> 10:11.918
You are really making
yourself at home here, huh?

10:11.985 --> 10:14.654
Sorry. Want to have sex?

10:14.722 --> 10:16.355
What?! No, no!

10:16.423 --> 10:17.190
God, no!

10:17.257 --> 10:18.324
Please close your legs up.

10:18.392 --> 10:21.794
That's... Listen, I don't want
to get into your personal life,

10:21.862 --> 10:22.929
you know what I mean?

10:22.996 --> 10:27.266
It's not really any of my business, but
this is really bumming me out, okay?

10:27.334 --> 10:28.935
So here's what I'd like to do.

10:29.002 --> 10:31.337
I'd like to talk game
plan with you, okay?

10:31.405 --> 10:34.941
And, um, number one, and most
importantly, uh, the car.

10:35.008 --> 10:35.808
Now hear me out.

10:35.876 --> 10:38.811
It was kinda a gift, so it'd be
pretty rude of you to try and...

10:38.879 --> 10:40.780
I don't give a shit
about the car, okay?

10:40.848 --> 10:41.447
Mm-hmm.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.715
My life is in ruins.

10:42.783 --> 10:43.382
Mm-hmm.

10:43.450 --> 10:44.450
I'm gonna lose my kids.

10:44.518 --> 10:46.018
Okay, great, so we're in agreement.

10:46.086 --> 10:46.919
I keep the car.

10:46.987 --> 10:47.587
That's wonderful.

10:47.654 --> 10:53.326
Now secondly, this is gonna be kind
of hard to hear, but, um... get out!

10:53.393 --> 10:55.661
Get out!

10:55.729 --> 10:57.663
You gotta go back to your wife, okay?

10:57.731 --> 10:58.931
And get out of my place.

10:58.999 --> 11:01.768
Okay, well, then I'm gonna need
the car to get over there.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.770
Okay, well, the car's
off the table, okay?

11:03.837 --> 11:06.139
We just discussed the car, and
we came to an agreement that...

11:06.206 --> 11:07.473
Stop bringing up the car, okay?

11:07.541 --> 11:10.343
So I'll get dressed and I'll drive you
over there, and I'll drop you off.

11:10.410 --> 11:11.010
Okay.

11:11.078 --> 11:12.044
Okay. Well, get up.

11:12.112 --> 11:14.647
No, oh, God, I don't, I don't...
Okay, I'm gonna go in here.

11:14.715 --> 11:15.314
Jesus.

11:15.382 --> 11:18.050
Yeah, you now, I mean, I
wouldn't have imagined the whole

11:18.118 --> 11:19.452
thing going down quite the way it did.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.821
It was a little uncomfortable,
but I'm glad, you know, we got

11:21.889 --> 11:25.158
our little heart-to-heart, or whatever
you want to call it, out of the way.

11:25.225 --> 11:28.227
I feel like now we can set aside
our differences and settle this

11:28.295 --> 11:29.595
whole divorce pretty
amicably, you know?

11:29.663 --> 11:31.397
You think it's gonna
be that easy, dude?

11:31.465 --> 11:32.932
Well, yeah, of course.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.935
I mean, marriage and divorce
these days, it's like a, it's

11:36.003 --> 11:38.137
more of a formality than
anything else, you know?

11:38.205 --> 11:40.506
It's just sort of something
that you do, right?

11:40.574 --> 11:42.308
Don't start with me, Charlie!

11:42.376 --> 11:43.576
You bring nothing to the table!

11:43.644 --> 11:44.243
Nothing!

11:44.311 --> 11:46.179
Oh!
I bring nothing to the table!

11:46.246 --> 11:47.213
This is my money!

11:47.281 --> 11:48.581
You bring nothing!

11:53.520 --> 11:54.720
Frank, okay?

11:54.788 --> 11:57.256
"How did my laundry get so clean?

11:57.324 --> 11:59.292
Oh, oh, who washed all
the dishes today?"

11:59.359 --> 12:00.626
Nobody washes the dishes!

12:00.694 --> 12:03.462
We eat the food directly off the
coffee table, and you know it!

12:03.530 --> 12:05.031
I cannot stand being married to you!

12:05.098 --> 12:06.365
Oh, you can't stand it?

12:06.433 --> 12:07.200
I'm gonna pull the plug.

12:07.267 --> 12:08.968
You gonna flush our
marriage down the toilet?!

12:09.036 --> 12:09.902
Right down the toilet!

12:09.970 --> 12:10.870
Flush it, big boy!

12:10.938 --> 12:11.871
Yes, there he goes!

12:11.939 --> 12:13.773
Flush it down the toilet
'cause I don't care!

12:13.841 --> 12:14.440
Oh, yeah?

12:14.508 --> 12:17.043
I'm gonna pull the plug, but first
I'm gonna draw up some documents.

12:17.110 --> 12:19.011
All right, this is gonna
be an ugly-ass divorce,

12:19.079 --> 12:20.346
and we're gonna get a mediator.

12:20.414 --> 12:21.447
Okay, I got it.

12:21.515 --> 12:23.850
We'll get that idiot lawyer
that always helps us out.

12:23.917 --> 12:24.884
He does good by us.

12:24.952 --> 12:25.751
Yeah, he's excellent.

12:25.819 --> 12:28.621
But he slapped a restraining order
on us, so we can't use him.

12:28.689 --> 12:31.023
Also you need a lawyer, too,
so we should talk about it.

12:31.091 --> 12:31.824
I need a lawyer?

12:31.892 --> 12:32.491
For what?

12:32.559 --> 12:34.493
How are you not grasping
this situation?

12:34.561 --> 12:36.229
Oh, for the divorce.

12:36.296 --> 12:36.963
The divorce, yeah.

12:37.030 --> 12:38.331
You're getting a divorce?

12:38.398 --> 12:38.998
Yeah.

12:39.066 --> 12:40.533
All right, sot's going around.

12:40.601 --> 12:43.336
Okay, I think I know someone
who'll take both our cases.

12:43.403 --> 12:45.938
Is it you?

12:46.006 --> 12:48.941
Is it?

12:49.009 --> 12:50.543
'Cause if it's you,
I'm not interested.

12:50.611 --> 12:52.778
All right, well, I have a
family member who's a lawyer.

12:52.846 --> 12:54.780
I bet he'd do it.

12:56.450 --> 12:58.084
It's coming up here.

12:58.151 --> 13:00.853
This...
yeah, this is it right here.

13:00.921 --> 13:02.955
The Ponderosas' ponderosa.

13:03.023 --> 13:04.290
Ugh!

13:04.358 --> 13:05.892
Could you wait a minute?

13:05.959 --> 13:07.894
I just want to make sure it's okay.

13:07.961 --> 13:12.198
Yeah, you know, whatever it's gonna
take to wrap this up, really.

13:12.266 --> 13:13.299
Whew!

13:17.671 --> 13:18.437
Ugh!

13:24.244 --> 13:24.944
Maureen?

13:25.012 --> 13:25.945
No, it's Dee.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.513
How are things going on your end?

13:27.581 --> 13:28.314
Oh, not bad.

13:28.382 --> 13:28.981
Yeah, not bad.

13:29.049 --> 13:29.649
I'm getting a divorce.

13:30.384 --> 13:31.984
Yeah, I know how that goes.

13:32.052 --> 13:34.787
I got a messy situation
going on on my end, too.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.722
Had to let my guy go.

13:36.790 --> 13:38.157
Had to cut him loose.

13:38.225 --> 13:40.326
I tell you what, though,
I do love the car.

13:40.394 --> 13:43.930
Hands-free Blue...
I can do all kinds of stuff with both hands.

13:45.399 --> 13:47.233
Dennis? Did we get cut off?

13:47.301 --> 13:48.401
Okay, hop in there.

13:48.468 --> 13:50.036
No! Wha-wha-wha-wha-what
is this?!

13:50.103 --> 13:51.170
What are you doing?

13:51.238 --> 13:52.204
Here he comes!

13:52.272 --> 13:53.306
Okay, go, go! Go, go!

13:53.373 --> 13:54.774
What?! Oh, my God!

14:00.918 --> 14:01.852
I'm so glad you called, Charlie.

14:01.919 --> 14:04.087
Your uncle never hears
from you anymore.

14:04.155 --> 14:06.690
Well, you're kind of the only
actual lawyer I know, you know,

14:06.757 --> 14:08.758
that doesn't have a
restraining order against me.

14:08.826 --> 14:11.628
So I sort of had to call you, so...
I miss you too, bud.

14:11.696 --> 14:14.397
Uh... with the touching, with
the touching... none of that.

14:14.465 --> 14:15.699
You're put off by my hands.

14:15.766 --> 14:17.534
I know they're very small.

14:17.602 --> 14:18.702
It's been very hard on me.

14:18.769 --> 14:20.470
It is not... there's nothing
wrong with your hands, okay?

14:20.538 --> 14:21.938
Can we just focus on the law?

14:22.006 --> 14:23.106
Of course.

14:23.174 --> 14:26.109
All right, as far as shared
assets, I'm not seeing much.

14:26.177 --> 14:27.244
I'm keeping the hot plate.

14:27.311 --> 14:28.478
Over my dead body.

14:28.546 --> 14:30.147
Hey, hey, hey, easy, boys.

14:30.214 --> 14:32.816
Don't let the dog off the leash, okay?

14:32.884 --> 14:36.386
Remember, the bigger
man walks away first.

14:36.454 --> 14:38.155
You can have the hot plate.

14:38.222 --> 14:39.923
Hot dog!

14:39.991 --> 14:41.858
Now we're cooking with gas.

14:41.926 --> 14:43.226
Moving along to art holdings.

14:43.294 --> 14:46.096
All I'm seeing is a series
of drawings of elephants.

14:46.164 --> 14:47.964
Hmm...
Oh, yeah.

14:48.032 --> 14:50.433
Well, Charlie did the
elephant drawings.

14:50.501 --> 14:52.068
Yeah, but...
You should keep 'em.

14:52.136 --> 14:53.803
I did those for you, man.

14:53.871 --> 14:54.905
I like 'em.

14:54.972 --> 14:56.173
Well, you should like 'em.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.574
I put a lot of work into 'em.

14:57.642 --> 14:59.876
And thank you for saying you like 'em.

14:59.944 --> 15:02.112
I've seen 'em and I like 'em, too.

15:02.180 --> 15:03.079
Yeah, they're good.

15:03.147 --> 15:04.347
I'll keep the drawings, okay?

15:04.415 --> 15:08.451
If I didn't know any better, I'd say
there's a lot of love in this room here.

15:08.519 --> 15:10.820
Look, Jack, we just want to
get back to where we were.

15:10.888 --> 15:14.191
That's... Sounds like what you
guys want is an annulment.

15:14.258 --> 15:17.394
It would essentially
void your partnership.

15:17.461 --> 15:19.229
Yeah, right, that sounds perfect.

15:19.297 --> 15:20.263
Marriage blows.

15:20.331 --> 15:21.932
Preaching to the choir, fellas.

15:23.234 --> 15:26.503
All right, I just need both
your signatures on here.

15:26.571 --> 15:28.538
All right, that's easy enough.

15:28.606 --> 15:30.840
Easy-peasy.

15:30.908 --> 15:33.376
One... two.

15:33.444 --> 15:34.377
We did it.

15:34.445 --> 15:35.312
That's it.

15:35.379 --> 15:37.781
Your union has hereby been dissolved.

15:37.848 --> 15:40.984
Why did we have to do all the touching
and the hand-holding if it was just...?

15:41.052 --> 15:41.785
It was fun.

15:41.852 --> 15:42.752
Hey, Mac.

15:42.820 --> 15:45.055
Do you mind snapping a
photo for the Web site?

15:45.122 --> 15:46.823
But keep my hands out of the shot.

15:51.362 --> 15:53.496
I just kidnapped Bill
Ponderosa's kids.

15:53.564 --> 15:56.132
All right, are the kids
confined in any way, maybe in a

15:56.200 --> 16:00.270
crawl space or a backyard bunker?

16:00.338 --> 16:01.838
No, they're out in the car.

16:01.906 --> 16:03.173
Have you touched them yet?

16:03.241 --> 16:04.274
Absolutely not.

16:04.342 --> 16:05.308
What...? Who is this man?

16:07.011 --> 16:09.512
No, you don't need to...
What is she, some cheap tramp... huh?

16:09.580 --> 16:10.447
Oh, no.

16:10.514 --> 16:13.116
Bill, oh, my God, you
are such an asshole.

16:13.184 --> 16:14.351
I followed you, okay?

16:14.418 --> 16:16.453
Angel, I...
I knew you were seeing someone else.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.722
Honey, that... Hi.
Hi, there, I'm Dee.

16:18.789 --> 16:20.190
Uh, I understand that.

16:20.258 --> 16:24.227
Listen, I wanted to say I'm
really sorry about the kids.

16:24.295 --> 16:26.730
I tell you what, I did
not mean to kidnap them.

16:26.797 --> 16:28.932
That was all...
that was all this guy.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.433
Yeah, they're not my kids.

16:30.501 --> 16:31.835
Aren't you his wife?

16:31.902 --> 16:32.969
No.

16:33.037 --> 16:34.170
I'm his mistress.

16:34.238 --> 16:35.305
Well, what the hell, man?

16:35.373 --> 16:36.373
I'm taking my car back.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.407
Nuh-uh. That's my car.

16:37.475 --> 16:39.509
Actually, I loaned it to both of you ladies...

16:40.244 --> 16:40.910
Son of a bitch!

16:40.978 --> 16:42.045
I gonna kill you!

16:42.113 --> 16:44.781
What? How many
mistresses do you have?

16:44.849 --> 16:46.116
Mistress? I'm his wife.

16:46.183 --> 16:47.384
Kids, let's go.

16:47.451 --> 16:49.119
Yeah, come on, kids, let's go home.

16:49.186 --> 16:50.353
No, no, no, no, no.

16:50.421 --> 16:51.621
Not you, Bill.

16:51.689 --> 16:54.791
Now I want this to be
over with right now.

16:54.859 --> 16:56.026
So how much does he owe you?

16:56.093 --> 16:57.160
What?

16:57.228 --> 16:58.728
How much does he owe you, whore?

16:58.796 --> 17:00.563
How much does he owe you for the sex?

17:00.631 --> 17:01.865
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:01.932 --> 17:03.199
I'm not a prostitute.

17:03.267 --> 17:05.268
I think that's... that's clear.

17:05.336 --> 17:07.936
Oh, well, congratulations.

17:08.005 --> 17:11.107
You're the only woman he didn't
have to pay to sleep with.

17:11.175 --> 17:13.843
You must be very proud of yourself.

17:14.744 --> 17:15.645
Wait, no, no.

17:15.713 --> 17:17.146
Oh, goddamn it.

17:19.684 --> 17:22.419
Yeah, well.

17:22.486 --> 17:28.591
The, uh, the gravity of my situation
just set in, so... Let's go get you a

17:28.659 --> 17:29.259
divorce, huh?

17:29.327 --> 17:30.193
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:30.261 --> 17:32.796
Yeah.

17:32.863 --> 17:35.098
You guys have any questions?

17:35.166 --> 17:36.466
Yeah, I got a question.

17:36.534 --> 17:38.034
What's in the fanny pack?

17:38.102 --> 17:42.605
Oh, check this out, Mac and Dennis.

17:42.673 --> 17:44.274
Just a little victory dance.

17:44.342 --> 17:47.077
Thought maybe we could hang out later.

17:47.144 --> 17:49.045
No.

17:49.113 --> 17:51.081
No.

17:51.148 --> 17:53.983
Oh, Mr. Reynolds.

17:54.051 --> 17:56.886
Oh, uh, I'm sorry, what
are you doing here?

17:56.954 --> 17:59.589
Well, when I heard you were
getting divorced, I-I felt

17:59.657 --> 18:01.991
compelled to involve myself.

18:02.059 --> 18:08.531
I'm sorry, how would you have
heard that I was getting a

18:08.599 --> 18:12.202
listening to you drunkenly
explain all that at 3:00 a.m.

18:12.269 --> 18:15.338
I enjoyed it so much, that I
tracked down Maureen here and I

18:15.406 --> 18:18.908
offered her my services...
pro bono, of course.

18:18.976 --> 18:20.910
Hold on, fellas.

18:20.978 --> 18:22.278
I'm Jack Kelly.

18:22.346 --> 18:23.513
I'm a lawyer.

18:23.581 --> 18:25.181
Hello, Jack Kelly.

18:25.249 --> 18:26.816
The pleasure is all mine.

18:26.884 --> 18:28.852
It's a pleasure to meet you.

18:28.919 --> 18:32.722
The pleasure's... still...
Why don't we just get started.

18:32.790 --> 18:35.725
Why don't we just get started.

18:37.962 --> 18:45.502
Aw...
Boy, the old place, huh?

18:45.569 --> 18:48.638
Some good memories here.

18:48.706 --> 18:50.707
All of us.

18:50.775 --> 18:52.709
Oh, yeah.

18:55.446 --> 19:00.216
Hey, um... So I was like...
I'm gonna go, I think...

19:00.284 --> 19:01.551
No, no, no, stick around, dude.

19:01.619 --> 19:02.218
Stick around.

19:02.286 --> 19:02.886
Please don't go.

19:02.953 --> 19:04.454
I don't...
I don't want to, though.

19:05.189 --> 19:06.456
No, you should stay...
I use shea butter.

19:06.524 --> 19:08.558
Assorted lanolin products.

19:08.626 --> 19:10.727
Oh, I'm serious, you
could be a hand model.

19:10.795 --> 19:12.462
You've got the goods.

19:12.530 --> 19:13.763
That was quick, guys.

19:13.831 --> 19:15.532
Open and shut case, Dennis.

19:15.599 --> 19:16.232
Okay.

19:16.300 --> 19:17.667
Did you get the apartment back?

19:17.735 --> 19:18.368
I sure did.

19:19.437 --> 19:21.438
You did?

19:21.505 --> 19:23.573
And you also acquired Ms.

19:23.641 --> 19:25.108
Ponderosa's debt.

19:25.176 --> 19:26.042
Whoo-hoo.

19:26.110 --> 19:26.876
What? You're in debt?

19:26.944 --> 19:27.911
Not anymore.

19:27.978 --> 19:29.612
But you are... about 90K.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.815
This guy seems to think you
don't have a case and I'm

19:31.882 --> 19:33.116
inclined to agree with him.

19:33.184 --> 19:36.486
Yeah. Well, when I found out that Ms.
Ponderosa here had been

19:36.554 --> 19:40.290
cast out of her marital home, I
only thought it was fair that

19:40.357 --> 19:43.593
you assumed her debt in addition to
the alimony payments, of course.

19:43.661 --> 19:45.695
Wait a second... so I got
to pay alimony payments?

19:45.763 --> 19:47.330
Uncle Jack, what the hell?!

19:47.398 --> 19:48.598
I froze up.

19:48.666 --> 19:49.699
He's great.

19:49.767 --> 19:52.302
<i>Oh, congratulations,
Miss Ponderosa.</i>

19:52.369 --> 19:55.505
<i>Congratulations to you!</i>

19:55.573 --> 19:57.273
<i>See you around, Dennis.</i>

19:57.341 --> 19:58.041
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:58.108 --> 19:59.108
<i>Mac.</i>

19:59.176 --> 20:02.345
<i>Hey, Mac, would you mind taking
a shot of the three of us</i>

20:02.413 --> 20:04.714
<i>for the Web site.</i>

20:04.782 --> 20:06.182
<i>Come on, Dennis.</i>

20:06.250 --> 20:09.018
<i>And would it be okay if you put
your hands on top of mine?</i>

20:09.086 --> 20:10.353
<i>Like they're my hands?</i>

20:10.421 --> 20:11.221
<i>Sure, yeah.</i>

20:11.288 --> 20:11.888
<i>Like that?</i>

20:11.956 --> 20:12.622
<i>Yes.</i>

20:12.690 --> 20:13.389
<i>Okay.</i>

20:13.457 --> 20:14.557
<i>That looks like my hands.</i>

20:14.625 --> 20:17.026
<i>For the Web site.</i>

20:17.094 --> 20:19.362
<i>We're lawyers.</i>
