00:03.880 --> 00:05.666
Don't forget me.
Never

00:05.760 --> 00:07.227
JOH/V: The only way to keep
Jaq safe was to make

00:07.360 --> 00:08.679
a Remnant of his location.

00:08.760 --> 00:10.546
The Lady can't steal
what we don't remember.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.380
TUR/V: The Hul/en na ve been
stealing cn/lo’ren.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.027
We're getting them back.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.497
The deal is simple.
Take the RAC,

00:16.600 --> 00:17.862
free the kids...
Gareth!

00:17.960 --> 00:20.224
Hey.
TURN ”. Kick some green ass.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.429
Bring 'em home.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.543
What the hells?

00:25.640 --> 00:27.221
Their weapons systems
are powering up now.

00:27.320 --> 00:28.582
TURIN: We have to
blow up the RAC

00:28.680 --> 00:30.068
but the code has to be
entered manually,

00:30.160 --> 00:31.741
so one of you
ain't coming back.

00:31.840 --> 00:32.829
PIR' I got the short straw.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.740
Pip, I want you
to get out of there

00:34.840 --> 00:36.182
and I want you to do it now,
do you hear me?

00:36.280 --> 00:38.919
It's okay, Zeph.
Meet me in the middle.

00:42.760 --> 00:47.220
Promise me that you will end
Aneela if you can't save her.

00:49.640 --> 00:51.267
Now I see why she wants you.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.066
DUTCH: I know what Aneela
was t/y/ng to say.

00:53.160 --> 00:54.866
She was telling me
how to let her out...

00:55.680 --> 00:57.864
What did you do?
You need a better guide.

00:57.960 --> 01:00.178
Dutch! Dutch?

01:00.280 --> 01:01.599
(GASPS)

01:06.600 --> 01:08.943
Hello, boys.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.262
Miss me?

01:15.240 --> 01:17.219
Johnny’?
Yeah, D’av.

01:17.320 --> 01:18.389
Johnny.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.347
Are you two going to keep
saying each other's names,

01:21.440 --> 01:23.067
or is someone going
to help me up?

01:29.520 --> 01:30.862
Aneela?

01:33.000 --> 01:35.821
Johnny Favorite doesn't
seem so unconvinced.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.139
It's hard to forget the eyes of someone
who tried to stab me in the heart.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.461
You seem better now.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.742
Sweetness, I told you
to pace yourself.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.705
Need to lie down?
I'm...

01:49.800 --> 01:50.869
She's fine.
She's drunk.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.224
Is that Pree the bartender?

01:53.320 --> 01:54.423
(LAUGHS)

01:54.520 --> 01:55.839
She is so drunk.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.239
Okay-

01:58.520 --> 02:00.021
(SIGHS)

02:00.640 --> 02:01.857
Everything okay?

02:01.960 --> 02:03.587
That crew, who knows.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.420
No, I mean with you.

02:06.600 --> 02:07.988
You feel hot.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.900
I'd be worried ifI didn't.

02:11.560 --> 02:14.620
All right, you ruffians. The
party's just getting started.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.506
(CROWD CHEERING)

02:16.720 --> 02:19.359
The Green pool, where is it?
Hold on just...

02:19.440 --> 02:20.577
If you're Aneela,
then where is Dutch?

02:20.680 --> 02:22.898
She's in the Green.
Stop!

02:24.080 --> 02:26.184
In the Green how?

02:26.280 --> 02:27.781
We switched bodies.

02:27.880 --> 02:30.587
Now I need the pool
so I can bring you back in.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.466
That's impossible.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.347
Was it impossible when you
switched bodies with my papa?

02:35.440 --> 02:37.146
That

02:38.800 --> 02:40.347
Okay, fine. Fair point.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.658
Now, what do you need
so you can stop asking me

02:42.760 --> 02:45.581
stupid questions
and take me to this pool?

02:45.680 --> 02:46.897
Proof.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.139
Lucy, give me Dutch's
current EEG readings.

02:49.240 --> 02:52.220
We're not going anywhere until you
tell us what exactly the Green is.

02:52.320 --> 02:53.503
Is it even a real place?

02:53.600 --> 02:55.659
It's difficult to explain.

02:55.760 --> 02:56.863
Try-

02:57.960 --> 02:59.507
(SIGHS)

03:01.560 --> 03:02.902

03:04.320 --> 03:06.584
_ Is_this like a _
trIck SCIence question?

03:07.560 --> 03:10.142
LUCY: Please refrain from
smashing things in my cargo hold.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.628
Now it's gone.

03:12.320 --> 03:14.902
But in your mind,
can you still imagine it?

03:16.640 --> 03:18.346
Can you see it?

03:18.440 --> 03:20.579
Whole and unbroken?

03:22.320 --> 03:23.901
Can you see it?
Yes.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.501
I see it. It's a bottle.
It's in your hands.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.222
That is where we're going.

03:28.320 --> 03:31.585
The Green is a living
repository of universal memory.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.706
A transdimensional space
that records everything.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.506
Where nothing is forgotten.

03:36.600 --> 03:40.548
So how exactly does it turn regular
people into undying dickheads?

03:40.640 --> 03:42.028
That isn't the Green.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.781
That's The Lady.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.381
LUCY ’1 Johnny, whoever this is,

03:45.480 --> 03:47.664
her brain wave patterns
do not match Dutch.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.829
I am here

03:48.920 --> 03:51.343
because I am the only one
who can bring you in,

03:51.440 --> 03:54.500
and I need D'avin because he's the
only one who can stop The Lady

03:54.600 --> 03:55.942
long enough for us
to get back out

03:56.040 --> 03:58.622
and destroy her
once and for all.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.461
Is that good enough for you?

04:01.560 --> 04:03.425
I guess we're going on a trip.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.705
Not you, Johnny Favorite.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.301
Just D ’ awn.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.181
We haven't got much time.
Neither does Dutch.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.619
DUTCH: We ’re all
made of memories. . .

04:26.640 --> 04:30.064
KHt YE/V: But memories
aren ’t just where you ’Ve been,

04:30.160 --> 04:32.264
they’re who you are.

04:33.080 --> 04:36.106

05:01.840 --> 05:03.979
TURIN: Before anybody
goes into any Green pool,

05:04.080 --> 05:05.581
I want some details.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.466
I haven't signed off
on anything yet.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.902
Why would you need to?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.423
Because it's still my operation
and my ship, Yardeen.

05:12.840 --> 05:15.024
Your ship?

05:15.120 --> 05:17.179
Remember when we
’mew up the RAC

05:17.280 --> 05:18.861
to save everybody and stop
The Lady? Remember, Dutch?

05:18.960 --> 05:20.587
Of course.

05:20.680 --> 05:22.500
Thank you, Tersin.

05:22.600 --> 05:26.479
_ _Tu_rin. _
Your sacrifice IS apprecnated.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.869
I will do my best to honor it.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.639
Think I prefer regular bitchy
Dutch to creepy nice Dutch.

05:36.720 --> 05:38.620
Well, they both
have their moments.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.544
Zeph, we need the pool.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.460
Get out.
Zeph, I'm sorry,

05:47.560 --> 05:48.629
there's no time to explain.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.097
Well, that is the great thing
about leaving, you don't have to.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.259
You just go.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.066
Why do you let your underlings

05:55.160 --> 05:57.867
speak to you this way?
Underling?

05:58.000 --> 05:58.989
Get out.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.581
This was a bad idea.

06:00.680 --> 06:02.466
But I like this one.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.900
Why is Dutch talking
like that?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.900
Because that isn't Dutch.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.422
Aneela Kin Rit,

06:08.520 --> 06:11.159
you stand accused
of the murder of Alvis Akari,

06:11.240 --> 06:13.902
the destruction of three
fully-manned RAC stations,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.377
and the attempted genocide
of the people of Westerley,

06:16.520 --> 06:17.589
and now you're gonna
pay for it.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.625
Turin, you can't arrest her.

06:19.720 --> 06:20.789
Who said arrest?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.063
Tufln,no!

06:26.960 --> 06:29.019

06:30.400 --> 06:31.901
Come on, you evil bitch!

06:32.680 --> 06:35.501
Stop playing around
and face me!

06:38.840 --> 06:40.705
Khlyen.

07:05.160 --> 07:08.061
Okay, everybody stay cool.

07:08.160 --> 07:10.025
This is all very exciting.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.940
Glad somebody's having fun.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.302
Won't be much longer, darling.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.617
Like shit, it Will, Turin.

07:14.720 --> 07:17.143
If you shoot her,
you kill Dutch, trust me.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.947
After you bullshitted your way
in here? Not a chance.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.600
Has the testosterone made you
guys all into raging assholes,

07:22.680 --> 07:24.147
or did I just miss something?

07:24.240 --> 07:26.060
Men need to fight.
It gives them meaning.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.501
And us entertainment.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.943
ZEPH: Well, lam
not entertained.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.541
Wait...

07:32.680 --> 07:34.147
If you're Aneela
in Dutch's body,

07:34.240 --> 07:36.140
how can you physically
bring anyone into the Green?

07:36.240 --> 07:38.140
Hey, we're having
a standoff over here.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.867
It has nothing to do
with the physical properties.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.985
The plasma operates
on a subatomic frequency

07:42.080 --> 07:44.059
more akin to radio waves.
That makes no sense.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.424
Radio waves don't exist
on a subatomic frequency.

07:46.520 --> 07:47.987
Guys, seriously,
a lot of guns here.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.980
Which is why I said "akin to."

07:50.800 --> 07:53.223
I can manipulate
the frequency mentally.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.140
Have you considered
D'avin's repulsion effect

07:55.240 --> 07:57.299
on the Green?
Considered?

07:58.400 --> 07:59.867
I'm counting on it.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.144
I guess this could work.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.707
I don't give a hot ball sack
what works.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.859
I watched my men and
women die because of her.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.905
Lose their minds
because of her.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.503
I watched my ship...

08:13.400 --> 08:15.823
How can I let you go
in there with this?

08:15.920 --> 08:17.899
Am I supposed to trust her?

08:18.960 --> 08:19.949
You're not.

08:21.320 --> 08:24.107
Zeph, give the spore
compound to Turin.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.986
Whoa! Hold on...
Do It.

08:27.680 --> 08:28.863
TURINI What is that?

08:28.960 --> 08:31.906
It's how we're gonna finish
this after we get Dutch out.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.663
But if shit gets weird and
Aneela is playing us, use it.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.159
Even if we're not out.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.901
That's a pretty big risk,
Jaqobis.

08:41.040 --> 08:42.746
Yeah, no shit.
That's the point.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.023
I don't trust her, Turin...

08:46.960 --> 08:48.177
But I do trust you

08:49.200 --> 08:51.225
to do what has to be done
If we can't.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.664
Okay, you guys seriously
all need therapy.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.097

09:13.240 --> 09:14.707
Nothing, why?

09:14.800 --> 09:15.937
You're lying on the ground.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.905
In the street.
Iam?

09:19.000 --> 09:20.467
(COUGHS)

09:20.800 --> 09:22.825
I'm gonna get you
some help, all right?

09:27.800 --> 09:29.142
I'm ready.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.421
These are useless.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.025
You already have
what you need.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.179
D'av's weird green
explodey thing?

09:39.720 --> 09:41.665
Technical term.

09:41.760 --> 09:45.344
Your brother's repulsive
effect on the Green

09:45.480 --> 09:49.826
is a result of a previous
operation he had on his amygdala.

09:51.520 --> 09:54.182
Yeah, it's part of
an army experiment.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.706
Um, this feels a bit...

09:57.840 --> 10:00.582
(EXCLAIMING)
Bad! This feels bad! Ow!

10:00.680 --> 10:01.749
I created a serum

10:01.840 --> 10:05.424
to suppress the effect long enough
for you to enter Green space.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.626
Once inside,
The Lady will attack.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.280
You need to harness
the ability to fight back.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.907
H ow?

10:13.440 --> 10:15.305
Well, how have you
done it before?

10:15.440 --> 10:18.000
He kind of just makes a poo face
and then people's eyes explode.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.305
Well, you do.
All you need to do

10:22.400 --> 10:24.425
is hurt The Lady
long enough to distract her,

10:24.560 --> 10:26.983
giving me the time
to get the three of us out.

10:27.680 --> 10:30.319
Clear?
Crystal.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.987
Except I think you meant
the four of us.

10:32.080 --> 10:35.664
I told you, Johnny Favorite,
we don't need you.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.500
Yes, you do.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.862
If D'av's your secret weapon

10:38.960 --> 10:40.825
then you need somebody
to protect him, and that's me.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.182
(SCOFFS)

10:42.320 --> 10:43.867
In there,

10:44.760 --> 10:47.467
everything you care about
is a weakness,

10:47.560 --> 10:50.302
especially family.
We know.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.380
That's why we got rid of the
memory of where Jaq's located.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.339
Who's Jaq?

11:00.560 --> 11:02.061
Your son.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.186
You've never seen him.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.577
I think Zeph must have some pictures
from all the tests that she ran.

11:09.680 --> 11:10.863
No, no.

11:13.360 --> 11:16.386
The Lady will use
everything against us.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.599
Our greatest fears,

11:20.680 --> 11:23.740
our worst moments.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.500
What would she know
about you from Dutch?

11:29.600 --> 11:31.465
Pretty much everything.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.142
Then that's exactly
what she'll use.

11:37.640 --> 11:38.959
Okay-

11:39.520 --> 11:40.703
So...

11:42.520 --> 11:44.977
How does this work?

11:45.840 --> 11:47.159
Like this.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.897
(GASPS)

11:58.000 --> 11:59.661
Don't bother getting dressed.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.377
D'avin?

12:02.200 --> 12:04.464
D'avin! What are you doing?

12:06.120 --> 12:07.747
D'avin, stop!

12:07.840 --> 12:10.422
A/VEELA: The Lady wﬂl use
everything against us.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.940
Our greatest fears,

12:15.040 --> 12:18.305
our worst moments. . .

12:22.720 --> 12:24.221
(GASPS)

12:29.160 --> 12:31.867
A/VEELA:
What would The Lady
know about you from Dutch?

12:33.000 --> 12:34.422
JOHN ”. Pretty much everything.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.943
A/VEELA:
Then that’s exactly
what she 7/ use.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.462
Pretty Pawter.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.899
No,no,no!
Kill them all.

12:47.040 --> 12:50.225
All/EELA:
E veryth/ng you care
aboé/t is
weakness,

12:50.320 --> 12:51.981
espeCIa/ly fam/ly.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.342
It's okay, it's okay.
Just stay with me, Pawter.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.341
Stay with me. I'm not
gonna let you die again.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.183
Not this time.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.225
D'av, it's me!

13:20.760 --> 13:22.546
(GIGGLES)

13:22.760 --> 13:23.977
No.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.069
What's the matter, D'avin?

13:25.200 --> 13:26.542
No.

13:27.080 --> 13:30.186
This isn't real. No.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.100
(LAUGHS)

13:38.200 --> 13:39.906
(GASPS)

13:41.440 --> 13:42.577
DUTCH: Aneela...

13:44.120 --> 13:45.144
You're back.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.223
You're still here.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.106
W
hereis D’av’?

13:49.200 --> 13:51.225
She separated us
from the boys.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.629
The boys? Johnny came, too?

13:54.280 --> 13:55.463
He insisted.

13:56.680 --> 13:57.897
Of course, he did.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.582
You need to find the boys
before The Lady finds us.

14:02.640 --> 14:03.902
You've seen Papa?

14:04.480 --> 14:06.027
No.

14:07.960 --> 14:09.302
I found this.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.068
What's in it?

14:12.520 --> 14:14.067
Nothing.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.023
But you kept it.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.182
I think it's for you.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.519
(SIGHS)

14:29.240 --> 14:31.982
Letting go is
never easy, is it?

14:33.600 --> 14:35.659
I can hold her off
until you find the boys

14:35.760 --> 14:37.182
but not for much longer.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.622
Go.

14:38.720 --> 14:39.937
Be brave.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.425
Be brutal.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.061
SEYAH: Aneela...

14:50.720 --> 14:52.506
We really need to talk.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.342
I told you, Gared, I'm fine.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.749
Okay, give me a good, "Ahh."

15:04.600 --> 15:06.181
This is not
great for business.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.783
Well, neither is that mucus
coating your tonsils.

15:09.760 --> 15:12.103
Gross.
I'm getting out of here.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.200
Remind me to call you when I really
need to clear this place out.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.498
You said this all started after you
got back from the RAC mission?

15:17.600 --> 15:20.160
Hey. Could you take a look at
Ginny? She's getting worse.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.185
Okay, I'll be right over.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.987
And I kind of mentioned
that you were here,

15:25.080 --> 15:27.640
and there are kind of
some other folks to see you.

15:27.720 --> 15:29.381
How many folks?

15:30.040 --> 15:31.462
Uh...

15:33.040 --> 15:34.143
VVhoa!

15:34.240 --> 15:36.265
How is this spreading so fast?

15:37.800 --> 15:39.665
Wait...

15:39.760 --> 15:41.785
I need to check something.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.585
SEYAH: Aren't you tired
of all this?

15:48.560 --> 15:51.620
All the running, the fighting.

15:51.760 --> 15:54.627
So much drama, don't you find?

15:54.720 --> 15:57.462
I can think of a
simple way to stop it.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.343
Die.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.061
So angry-

16:04.160 --> 16:06.025
It isn't healthy.

16:06.120 --> 16:10.181
It happens when you torture and
lie to someone for centuries.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.662
Sorry about that.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.627
I'm a slow learner,
but I do learn, Aneela.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.988
And...

16:18.320 --> 16:19.503
I want to make it up to you.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.662
Convenient,

16:24.760 --> 16:26.739
now that we're coming for you.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.381
Your Killjoy friends.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.584
I've got them busy
at the moment.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.702
So you and I

16:34.520 --> 16:36.738
can just talk.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.338
Girl to girl.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.746
You can't use her face

16:54.840 --> 16:57.707
to make me forget
who you really are.

16:59.360 --> 17:00.622
No,

17:01.480 --> 17:04.426
but maybe it will help you
listen to what I have to say.

17:05.480 --> 17:09.223
What if everyone
could get what they wanted

17:09.320 --> 17:13.268
and no one had_to win
or lose anything?

17:19.120 --> 17:20.303
Please.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.619
At least let me show you.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.668
It's the kids, Turin.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.819
Everyone who came
in contact with them is sick.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.626
TURI/V: Goo’s, the kids.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.421
It's not just the whole town.

17:39.520 --> 17:42.546
We ’re getting reports of the same
symptoms from a// over the place.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.824
Well, at that rate all of Westerley
will be infected within days.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.229
I have to go find my girl,
she can't be alone.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.345
Gared's with her, Ginny,
you have to stay here.

17:49.440 --> 17:52.944
You're too skinny and too
small to tell me what to do.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.064
Okay---...

17:54.640 --> 17:56.107
(GASPING)

17:56.200 --> 17:57.861
Pree, help!

18:01.600 --> 18:02.817
Ginny?

18:04.200 --> 18:05.337
Ginny.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.177
Ginny, honey, say something.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.440
Her vitals are stable, but
she has no ocular response.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.067
Brain function is...

18:14.000 --> 18:15.501
Well, this is new.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.261
New how? New, good?

18:17.360 --> 18:20.500
ZEPH:
Her entire cerebral cortex
has shut dogvn- She ’s in
coma.

18:21.320 --> 18:22.787
So, no, not good.

18:22.880 --> 18:27.340
I have never seen a natural virus
spread this fast With these symptoms.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.785
That's because it isn't a natural virus.
It's an act of war,

18:30.920 --> 18:33.787
and we need to stop it
before it spreads any further.

18:35.920 --> 18:39.219
As of now, all of Westerley
is under quarantine.

18:47.320 --> 18:48.742
What is this place?

18:48.840 --> 18:49.864
This...

18:51.000 --> 18:52.979
This is what I remember.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.947
My race was ancient
before I was even born.

18:56.040 --> 18:58.600
Spreading to every
corner of space.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.899
Driven by instinct, by nature,
to dominate and rule.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.980
Until I was the last of us...

19:05.120 --> 19:08.305
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

19:08.400 --> 19:10.618
To see everything
you've known,

19:10.720 --> 19:12.859
everything you've ever loved

19:14.160 --> 19:16.264
crumble and die?

19:18.080 --> 19:19.581
Butthen".

19:19.720 --> 19:21.585
I found this.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.280
A place where nothing is lost.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.737
A way for everything
to be remembered.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.622
So you're just a memory.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.621
You only exist in here now.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.699
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

19:36.480 --> 19:38.425
I'm sorry,

19:38.520 --> 19:41.307
but we live, we die.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.425
That's the natural order
of things.

19:43.520 --> 19:45.579
You've lived almost
three centuries.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.784
Is that the natural order
of things?

19:47.880 --> 19:49.097
I didn't ask for that.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.100
No, but that's what
I gave you.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.460
And now I don't think
it's too much to ask

19:54.560 --> 19:56.221
for something in return.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.343
And what if you can't have it?

20:00.640 --> 20:03.825
Let's not go to
worst-case scenarios just yet.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.943
D'AVINI Dutch?

20:10.680 --> 20:12.739
Dutch, where the
hells are you?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.661
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

20:14.800 --> 20:16.700
Yeah, that sounds promising.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.427
DUTCH: Dev!

20:18.520 --> 20:20.499
Don't worry, it gets worse.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.737
(BOTH SIGH)

20:27.640 --> 20:29.585
Wait, how do I know it's you?

20:33.760 --> 20:35.660
It's definitely you.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.102
I like what you did here.

20:37.200 --> 20:38.667
Yeah, well,
don't get used to it.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.739
I assume you met The Lady?
Yeah, not a fan.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.159
Definitely looking forward
to kicking her ass.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.901
Same, but we all
need to be together.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.342
Where's Johnny?
I don't know.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.509
I was looking for him
and then I just...

20:46.640 --> 20:48.221
Well, how did you find me?

20:48.320 --> 20:50.823
I don't know, I was on Lucy
and then I was here.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.103
Well, what were you
thinking about?

20:52.200 --> 20:53.337
You.

20:54.760 --> 20:57.706
Actually, thinking about
kicking the shit out of you.

20:57.800 --> 20:58.869
Oh.

20:59.720 --> 21:02.541
Okay, then let's think about
where Johnny would be.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.779
His worst moment.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.427
The one place he'd
never want to go back to.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.499
I know where he is.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.381
I think it's okay.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.983
No, we have to keep moving.
Johnny.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.629
You did it.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.460
You saved me...

21:23.040 --> 21:25.543
And now we can be
together forever.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.025
But I didn't save you.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.261
Look at me. I'm here.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.861
I'm alive.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.659
You're not Pawter.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.621
Does it really matter?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.979
Aren't you tired
of being lonely?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.900
Wouldn't this be easier?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.661
Yes.

21:55.160 --> 21:56.582
But it's not real.

21:57.160 --> 21:59.105
It's as real as you
want it to be.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.861
Why are you doing this?

22:04.080 --> 22:05.866
What do you want from us?

22:06.560 --> 22:07.982
Memory.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.944
Something my race never had.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.941
I'm not talking about the
animal instincts that drove us.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.224
It's something deeper.

22:16.320 --> 22:20.780
Something that allows you to
remember connections to your past.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.667
To imagine your future.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.547
It's what makes you so unique,

22:26.640 --> 22:28.505
but also so vulnerable.

22:29.680 --> 22:33.229
Even now, you're looking at me

22:33.320 --> 22:35.629
and you know...

22:35.720 --> 22:38.029
You know what I really am.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.900
But all you can see

22:43.280 --> 22:45.180
is the memory
of what you lost.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.139
And if you stay here, Johnny,

22:48.240 --> 22:50.219
I'll never die

22:51.640 --> 22:54.017
and you can love me forever.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.139
Johnny.

22:59.240 --> 23:02.107
D'av.
I know, Johnny.

23:02.200 --> 23:03.781
Let's go.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.299
Johnny, remember
where you are.

23:10.520 --> 23:12.738
Johnny.

23:12.840 --> 23:15.946
Johnny, don't leave me here!

23:16.080 --> 23:17.661
D'av... Johnny, don't
let me die again!

23:17.760 --> 23:19.102
Yeah, buddy?

23:19.200 --> 23:21.179
Don't let me
turn around, okay?

23:21.280 --> 23:23.464
Okay,
Johnny!

you need fluids.

23:42.640 --> 23:43.902
You want some tea?

23:44.000 --> 23:45.137
Gated, I ’m fine.

23:45.240 --> 23:46.377
How about a heating pad?

23:46.480 --> 23:48.698
A blankie?
Gared.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.937

23:50.320 --> 23:51.821
Yes. Fine.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.740

What the hells is going on
with those supplies?

24:23.960 --> 24:25.222
Working on it, Zeph.

24:25.320 --> 24:26.821
How are things coming
on your end?

Not now.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.267
Well, it'd be a hell of a lot
easier if I had the proper supphes.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.180
Commander, you should know...
Not now!

24:33.840 --> 24:36.980
Next time, Zeph, you try negotiating
with these Qreshi assholes.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.384
And here I thought
you liked me, Turin.

24:39.480 --> 24:43.109
Seyon Faresh of Land Faresh
docked 10 minutes ago.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.827
Hang in there, Zephyr.

24:45.720 --> 24:49.099
Looks like the cavalry
has finally arrived.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.781
D'AVIN: This place
makes no sense.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.700
How did we go from the woods
to Old Town to the woods?

24:52.800 --> 24:54.586
It makes perfect sense. You
don't think of things in order.

24:54.720 --> 24:55.823
One memory leads to another,

24:55.920 --> 24:57.137
and that triggers something
completely different.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.309
So whose memory is this?

24:58.400 --> 25:00.459
Because if it's yours or mine
from summer camp,

25:00.600 --> 25:02.659
I'm not protecting you
from the Kerson brothers.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.500
This is The Lady's.

25:05.240 --> 25:08.380
It's where she feels
strongest. We need to move.

25:08.480 --> 25:10.300
Aneela tell you what
you have to do?

25:10.400 --> 25:12.186
Sure. Once we're all together
Aneela gets us ready to go

25:12.320 --> 25:14.629
and D'av does the
old poo face trick.

25:14.720 --> 25:16.301
You know, yourjealousy's
pretty obvious by now.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.982
And then we get the hells out of here
and burn this bitch to the ground.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.063
Let's move.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.479
(GUN FIRES)

25:22.880 --> 25:24.586
What the shit?

25:26.400 --> 25:27.901
Are those Ferran?

25:32.160 --> 25:33.787
(GUNFIRE CONTINUES)

25:33.880 --> 25:36.144
Oh, yeah, I'm really glad
we don't have guns right now.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.319
She's trying to hold us off.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.981
We need to get past them
to get to Aneela.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.660
Great. Any ideas how?

25:43.760 --> 25:45.079
We need weapons.

25:45.160 --> 25:46.741
Aneela told us
what the Green is.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.102
It's a memory
repository system

25:48.200 --> 25:49.781
and systems are meant
to be hacked.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.222
We need weapons?

25:51.360 --> 25:52.782
Where do we usually get them?

25:53.760 --> 25:55.022
DUTCH: Let's go.

25:57.880 --> 26:00.098
Hang in there, boys.
I'm in the armory.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.789
I was hoping
you'd show yourself.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.979
Look what I found.
Enough magic bullshit.

26:13.080 --> 26:14.217
Let's Shoot stuff.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.307
Sorry, Banyon,
can't stay this time.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.426
Why fight me

26:22.520 --> 26:25.626
when you could join me?

26:26.280 --> 26:30.501
I have no desire to become
another one of your Slaves.

26:30.600 --> 26:32.147
The Hullen?

26:32.240 --> 26:34.344
Just a means to an end.

26:34.440 --> 26:36.385
You have no idea

26:36.480 --> 26:38.505
what I plan to do
when I get out.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.306
You can be a part of it.

26:42.600 --> 26:46.229
Why would you think I'd want
anything to do with you?

26:46.320 --> 26:50.097
Because all I want is
what you want.

26:50.240 --> 26:53.380
(GUNS FIRING IN DISTANCE)

26:55.200 --> 26:58.465
You're about to see
what I want.

27:02.440 --> 27:04.419
Now that's what
I'm talking about!

27:09.080 --> 27:11.059
DUTCH: Keep advancing!
We're getting closer.

27:15.480 --> 27:17.345
Do you want a hand with that?
It's just, you know...

27:17.480 --> 27:19.744
It's tricky. Quit
harShing my rocket buzz.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.660
Less talking, more shooting.

27:25.800 --> 27:26.937
Move!

27:28.000 --> 27:30.139
So this is what's
left of the RAC.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.424
We're_in a bit
of a tranSition phase.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.420
I Should say so.

27:34.520 --> 27:37.466
But the nine families
have convened and agreed

27:37.560 --> 27:40.222
that you need our help.
ExceHenL

27:40.320 --> 27:42.777
We're gonna need
cots, food supplies.

27:42.880 --> 27:45.019
I got a RAC agent down there
who needs medical equipment.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.985
She's already working up
an antidote.

27:47.080 --> 27:49.219
Antidote? For what?

27:49.920 --> 27:53.424
To stop the horrible illness
sweeping through Westerley.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.143
Not necessary.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.219
There's no time
for an antidote.

27:57.360 --> 28:00.067
We have enough
nuclear missiles on Qresh

28:00.160 --> 28:02.299
online and ready to wipe out

28:02.400 --> 28:05.460
any disease-bearing organisms
off the face of this moon,

28:05.560 --> 28:09.860
stopping any outbreak before it
spreads to the rest of The Quad.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.504
You can't wipe out an entire
population just to be safe.

28:13.600 --> 28:18.720
I can if it ensures that Qresh isn't
overrun by some mysterious plague.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.220
You need Westerley.

28:21.320 --> 28:24.187
You make money off Westerley.
And we will again,

28:24.280 --> 28:26.339
once all the Sick people
are gone.

28:26.440 --> 28:31.639
I am sure you have some sentimental
attachment to this dirtball,

28:31.720 --> 28:33.824
but I can assure you
Qresh does not.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.377
I got people on the ground
working on a cure.

28:36.480 --> 28:37.902
And if that doesn't work?

28:44.320 --> 28:46.345
I know how to stop the one
who started this.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.862
ZEPH: Well, it may not be
pretty but it just might work.

28:55.040 --> 28:57.497
If it does, can we sell it
at happy hour?

28:58.160 --> 28:59.821
Won't know until I try it.

28:59.920 --> 29:02.343
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Little miss doctor.
What are you doing?

29:03.120 --> 29:04.508
Every treatment
needs a test case.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.500
And what if it doesn't work?

29:06.640 --> 29:08.301
What if it makes it worse?

29:08.400 --> 29:11.540
No, no, we need a doctor
to keep working.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.219
Not a bartender.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.503
I'm the one who took the risk.

29:15.600 --> 29:16.703
I'm the one
who pays the price.

29:20.240 --> 29:21.980
You know what that is?

29:23.480 --> 29:25.584
Honorable?
Stupid,

29:25.680 --> 29:28.581
short-Sighted, and cowardly.

29:28.680 --> 29:32.787
Cowardly's letting someone else make a
sacrifice that could get them killed.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.867
No.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.458
That's making the hard call so
the rest of us don't have to.

29:39.560 --> 29:40.982
Like Pip did.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.218
How do I get over this, Pree?

29:48.160 --> 29:50.025
Oh, sweetheart,

29:51.560 --> 29:53.380
you don't.

29:54.160 --> 29:57.709
_ Life isn't about
getting over or letting go.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.267
Just moving ahead,

30:00.760 --> 30:03.581
because there's nothing
behind you but Shadows.

30:19.480 --> 30:21.744
DUTCH: The Lady is
stalling us. We need to hurry!

30:25.000 --> 30:26.467
(MEN YELLING)

30:30.040 --> 30:31.985
I'm not gonna be able to
hold them off for much longer.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.227
Enough!

30:39.640 --> 30:41.744
What was that?

30:42.560 --> 30:44.107
What's the matter?

30:44.720 --> 30:46.267
Afraid?

30:48.360 --> 30:50.146
Hold on.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.219
You could have done that
the whole time?

30:52.320 --> 30:54.629
So now someone
likes my poo face.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.159
It doesn't have to be
this way, Aneela.

30:58.240 --> 31:00.185
You don't know
what you're giving up.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.259
I know what you took from me.

31:03.240 --> 31:04.502
Time,

31:04.600 --> 31:06.261
life,

31:06.360 --> 31:08.419
happiness.

31:08.520 --> 31:12.502
And I am going to enjoy

31:12.640 --> 31:14.665
taking all of that from you.

31:14.760 --> 31:17.137
Before you've heard
my final offer?

31:17.240 --> 31:19.105
You have nothing I want.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.987
Oh, but I really do.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.424
What if

31:26.520 --> 31:28.624
you could have
your family back?

31:30.080 --> 31:32.503
My father is dead.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.181
You're a liar.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.066
That's not what
I'm talking about.

31:36.160 --> 31:38.469
Listen to me, now, Aneela.

31:44.480 --> 31:47.222
What the hells is this place?
Old and nasty.

31:47.320 --> 31:49.743
The sooner we get the hells
out of here, the better.

31:59.120 --> 32:00.747
She's supposed to be here.

32:00.840 --> 32:02.023
She said she would be here.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.223
JAQ: Dad...
You sure put a lot of trust

32:03.320 --> 32:04.503
in someone who,
let's not forget,

32:04.600 --> 32:05.783
stabbed a bunch of people
that we liked.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.063
JAQ: Dad...
Starting with me.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.741
Jaq.
DUTCH: She had issues.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.462
How'd She get him? JOHN: ...faith
in someone that we don't know.

32:11.560 --> 32:14.222
We have to. We don't
have any other choice.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.505
W
hereis D’av’?

32:22.400 --> 32:24.425
SEYO/V FARESH: I ’ve informed the
capital to prepare the m/Lss/les.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.579
Time's up, Turin.
You can't do this.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.659
We can do whatever we want.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.779
Turin! Turin, listen to me!

32:30.880 --> 32:32.461
The antidote worked!

32:32.560 --> 32:34.460
You hear that?

32:34.560 --> 32:36.585
Call off your firecrackers.

32:36.680 --> 32:37.863
Sunshine.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.145
Pree, your viral load
is dropping.

32:41.240 --> 32:43.504
You're gonna be up and dancing
with Gared in no time!

32:43.600 --> 32:45.261
Well, that's nice.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.788
But who's Gared?

32:48.160 --> 32:49.422
Pree.

32:50.480 --> 32:51.697
It's me.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.937
LUVAYA: Mommy!
Are you okay, Mommy?

32:58.440 --> 33:00.021
Who's your mommy, sweetie?

33:00.960 --> 33:03.019
Is she around here?

33:04.000 --> 33:06.377
Can somebody help
this little girl?

33:09.320 --> 33:10.787
Tell us where Jaq is.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.905
D'av!

33:13.000 --> 33:14.069
Well,

33:15.440 --> 33:16.759
now it's a party.

33:17.720 --> 33:19.142
D'av!

33:19.240 --> 33:20.559
I met the woman who's face
you're wearing.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.380
You're not fooling anyone.
JOHN: And so help me

33:22.520 --> 33:24.624
lam gonna enjoy
ripping it off of you.

33:24.720 --> 33:26.142
It's not for either of you.

33:26.240 --> 33:28.219
Is it, my dear?

33:29.400 --> 33:31.027
Aneela, what's going on?

33:31.120 --> 33:33.020
He wasn't strong enough.
I'm sorry.

33:33.120 --> 33:35.862
Sorry for what?
What did you do?

33:35.960 --> 33:37.302
I made an offer.

33:37.960 --> 33:39.348
And She made a choice.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.439
I'm going to get
my family back.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.465
The Lady is a liar.

33:46.560 --> 33:49.461
Khlyen is dead.
Your mother is hidden.

33:49.560 --> 33:50.982
Not them.

33:52.040 --> 33:53.826
Delle Seyah.

33:53.920 --> 33:55.547
And Jaq.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.621
If we let her out,
she'll let us go.

34:00.720 --> 34:02.859
Please, Aneela.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.382
You know you can't trust her.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.897
She wants to destroy you. She
wants to destroy all of us.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.104
I've seen it.
All I want

34:10.160 --> 34:12.219
is what every
living thing wants.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.666
More time.

34:14.760 --> 34:15.829
More life.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.824
A family of my own.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.668
Come, dear.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.148
It's time.

34:34.760 --> 34:35.977
I'm sorry.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.344
Remember what you
said to me once.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.624
You were here. You mattered.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.299
JOHN: Dutch?

34:49.320 --> 34:51.185
Was this part of the plan?

34:56.040 --> 34:59.862
I can't even imagine how it
will feel to finally get out.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.786
To be free again.

35:05.320 --> 35:08.141
I'm excited to see
how you do this.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.600
It's always been
a mystery to me.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.820
You're such a special girl,
Aneela.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.297
I need to concentrate.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.981
Take your time.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.744
They should be ready for me
when we get out.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.262
Think, Zephyr, think.

35:25.360 --> 35:26.987
A virus is an infective agent.

35:27.080 --> 35:28.149
It needs a host to replicate.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.628
But what if it_ wasn't
replicating itself?

35:29.720 --> 35:31.187
What if it was
for something else?

35:31.280 --> 35:33.919
Okay, the children
were carrying the virus.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.900
The virus was carrying
something that attacked

35:36.000 --> 35:37.979
the cerebral cortex,
wiping out the...

35:38.920 --> 35:42.265
The children were carrying
something that...

35:42.360 --> 35:44.305
Wiping out the...

35:46.520 --> 35:48.420
What was I saying?

35:50.400 --> 35:53.187
You're my mom. Okay?

35:53.280 --> 35:54.747
JOHN: D'av?

35:54.880 --> 35:56.302
D’av, come on.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.947
How could She do this?

35:58.040 --> 36:00.622
She chose her family.
She chose her fight.

36:00.760 --> 36:02.261
But after everything
she's been through

36:02.360 --> 36:03.941
just to give up,
it doesn't make any sense.

36:04.040 --> 36:05.621
No, it makes perfect sense.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.460
She gets out and goes
traipsing around the galaw

36:07.600 --> 36:09.625
with now the second
biggest bitch in the J,

36:09.720 --> 36:11.859
and Queen Asshole,
she probably closes the Green

36:11.960 --> 36:13.860
with the spore
just to kill us for funsieS.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.300
Maybe it's better
to just let him sleep.

36:18.400 --> 36:21.346
The spore.
I remember the spore.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.782
Great.
No, Johnny,

36:22.880 --> 36:24.825
that's what She meant.

36:26.480 --> 36:28.141
"You were here.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.422
"You mattered."

36:33.080 --> 36:34.866
I was here.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.579
YALE/VA: What is Aneela to you?

36:41.760 --> 36:43.899
I know what to do.

36:52.280 --> 36:54.339
She's my family.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.979
Like you.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.307
One request.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.903
If you can't do
the impossible,

37:08.680 --> 37:10.898
do the honorable.

37:12.120 --> 37:13.940
The thing I couldn't do.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.865
JOH/V: D’av...

37:28.720 --> 37:32.019
So, things got worse, huh?

37:32.120 --> 37:33.508
Let's see if we can fix that.

37:33.800 --> 37:36.018
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're
still using the Spore? What?

37:36.120 --> 37:37.826
In here? That's crazy, right?

37:37.920 --> 37:40.138
Johnny?
Crazy, yeah.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.549
Pretty much.
But it also might work.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.540
Where's Aneela?
Stalling for time.

37:44.640 --> 37:45.902
Waiting for us to find this,
find her,

37:46.000 --> 37:47.467
and get the hells out
of Green Town.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.902
Anyway, that's what I hope.

37:49.000 --> 37:52.743
Otherwise, you have a very small
window for "I told you so."

38:01.640 --> 38:03.949
Okay. It works?

38:04.040 --> 38:05.109
It works!

38:07.560 --> 38:09.266
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

38:15.000 --> 38:16.865
What did you do?

38:20.840 --> 38:24.139
I_made sure
you Will never get out.

38:24.280 --> 38:26.100
If the walls come down,

38:26.240 --> 38:28.026
it opens the passageways
in and out.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.627
Maybe.

38:30.720 --> 38:33.063
But you will never see them.

38:57.200 --> 38:59.703
Yeah, this was a great idea.

39:03.600 --> 39:04.669
DUTCH: Aneela!

39:05.760 --> 39:07.079
Where is she?
Where's The Lady?

39:07.160 --> 39:09.617
We can't wait.
The Lady's coming back.

39:09.720 --> 39:11.039
Go! Go!

39:26.440 --> 39:28.021
(RUMBLING)

39:33.040 --> 39:34.302
Papa?

39:43.080 --> 39:44.627
Come on!

39:44.720 --> 39:46.585
Come on.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.021
(GRU NTS)

39:53.520 --> 39:54.657
Aneela isn't out yet.

39:59.720 --> 40:00.744
The Green...

40:08.280 --> 40:10.066
It's dead.

40:10.160 --> 40:11.900
All of it. The Green is dead.

40:12.800 --> 40:13.983
We did it.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.279
Aneela...

40:32.320 --> 40:34.220
JOHN: Yala...

40:37.920 --> 40:40.059
Ah, Shit.

40:40.720 --> 40:42.062
We gotta wake up, Yala.

40:42.840 --> 40:44.228
Yala.

40:46.040 --> 40:47.359
Five more minutes...

40:47.440 --> 40:51.183
Sorry, hon, but five minutes
was half an hour ago.

40:51.680 --> 40:53.147
(GROANS)

40:54.560 --> 40:57.120
(SIGHS) Another day
full of joy.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.865
DUTCH: My father
told me a story once

41:00.960 --> 41:03.337
about a fam/ly that
got lost in the woods.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.903
Gotta run. Got a heavy shift
at the plant today.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.786
Now don't forget your lunch,
and remember to pick up

41:07.880 --> 41:09.859
the crate of Hokk
from Randall's after work.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.985
Oh, that might be a problem. Boys
are watching the fights tonight.

41:12.080 --> 41:13.627
Who do you think'S gonna be
the bigger problem?

41:13.720 --> 41:16.177
Me without the Hokk
or the boys?

41:16.280 --> 41:17.304
(CHUCKLES)

41:18.600 --> 41:20.067
Good point.

41:20.160 --> 41:22.264
Happy wife, happy life.

41:23.480 --> 41:28.907
DUTCH:
They left bread crumbs to mark their
path, so they’d never forget their way home.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.501
Asshole.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.147
Hey, Johnny.

41:33.080 --> 41:34.627
All set for the fights tonight?
No can do.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.466
I'm on bar duty.
But come by afterwards,

41:36.560 --> 41:38.505
shooters are on me.
Yeah, I know.

41:39.200 --> 41:41.100
I'm sorry, man.
Hey, watch it.

41:41.200 --> 41:42.224
What's your problem, pal?

41:43.160 --> 41:45.867
I don't have a problem.
Hey!

41:47.400 --> 41:49.960
You forgot your lunch.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.858
DUTCH: But a monster
lived in those woods...

41:52.960 --> 41:54.825
Thanks,hon.
...and one
by
one,

41:54.920 --> 41:56.308
it ate everything
they left behind.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.140
Relax, friend, have a drink.

41:58.240 --> 41:59.787
Bar's over there.

41:59.880 --> 42:01.859
Welcome to Old Town.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.186
What a shit hole.

42:13.640 --> 42:17.519
YOUNG GIRL: Memories

42:17.600 --> 42:19.227
they’re who you are.

42:20.280 --> 42:23.306
And if I own that; I own you.

42:25.480 --> 42:27.823
And now that I ’m out;

42:29.400 --> 42:32.107
I wﬂl own everyone.
