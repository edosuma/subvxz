15:48.182 --> 15:51.383
Every second is important.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.884
The rice is getting cold, the

15:52.885 --> 15:56.322
seaweed is getting soggy, fish,

15:56.323 --> 15:57.257
less than perfect temperature.

15:57.258 --> 15:58.590
Look at his posture.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.326
A fighter's stance.

16:00.327 --> 16:03.729
Distance, knowing the
perfect spot to be.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.731
Moving in and out as needed.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.000
Never out of position.

16:08.001 --> 16:08.701
Timing.

16:08.702 --> 16:10.869
Reacting to his customer's pace

16:10.870 --> 16:13.105

16:13.106 --> 16:18.577
desires, always ready
for the next move.

16:18.578 --> 16:22.014
Most people who don't
understand Sushi will go to a

16:22.015 --> 16:24.783
Sushi bar and say oh, I had
the best Sushi last night.

16:24.784 --> 16:25.951
The fish was so fresh.

16:25.952 --> 16:28.254
It was right out of the ocean.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.922
The freshest fish,
there is no taste.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.925
Just chewing, just hard.

16:33.926 --> 16:37.596
And people think
freshest should be good.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.431
But it wasn't.

16:38.432 --> 16:42.068
Yasuda's menu changes constantly
with what he finds in

16:42.069 --> 16:42.769
the market.

16:42.770 --> 16:45.204
Like thousands of other Sushi

16:45.205 --> 16:49.708
chefs, he heads every day to

16:49.709 --> 16:51.610
Tsukiji, Tokyo's central fish

16:51.611 --> 16:53.579
market, where the world's best

16:53.580 --> 16:55.047
seafood arrives every day.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.982
But unlike most others at his

16:56.983 --> 16:59.451
level who arrive at 4:00 A.M. to

16:59.452 --> 17:00.719
get what they perceive as the

17:00.720 --> 17:03.622
best and freshest,
Yasuda arrives later.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.224
He does not buy the ridiculously

17:06.226 --> 17:08.426
expensive otoro, the fatty belly

17:08.428 --> 17:10.829
meat of the blue fin tuna that

17:10.829 --> 17:12.464
people have been known to pay

17:12.464 --> 17:13.964
hundreds of dollars a pound for.

17:13.965 --> 17:16.135
Instead, he buys tuna from the

17:16.136 --> 17:17.769
heads, using his knife skills to

17:17.770 --> 17:19.505
go for qualities that most

17:19.506 --> 17:21.640
others miss, removing every bit

17:21.641 --> 17:23.942
of sinew from what would

17:23.943 --> 17:28.480
otherwise be a difficult
piece of meat.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.616
In total, it's, well, perfect.

17:30.617 --> 17:31.983
And he cures the results.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.185
Actually cures it.

17:33.186 --> 17:36.122
Breaking down its molecular

17:36.123 --> 17:37.523
structure in a desirable way by

17:37.524 --> 17:40.659
freezing it quickly in a medical

17:40.660 --> 17:41.528
grade blast freezer where it

17:41.529 --> 17:43.195
will stay for a week or longer

17:43.196 --> 17:45.030
in minus 82 degrees Celsius.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.665
He pioneered this technique

17:46.666 --> 17:47.833
years ago in New York, where if

17:47.834 --> 17:49.535
you bothered to ask, he would

17:49.536 --> 17:51.670
have proudly told you that the

17:51.671 --> 17:53.305
absolutely unbelievably sublime

17:53.306 --> 17:59.378
piece of perfect Sushi you
were eating was frozen.

17:59.379 --> 17:59.946
Delicious.

17:59.947 --> 18:01.513
Thank you very much.

18:01.514 --> 18:05.484
Which is more important,
the rice or the fish?

18:05.485 --> 18:06.518
Rice.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.354
More important?

18:07.355 --> 18:08.954
What percentage?

18:08.955 --> 18:10.222
About 90%.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.023
Wow.

18:11.024 --> 18:15.327
Fish is the second ingredient.

18:15.328 --> 18:19.798
The main ingredient is rice.

18:19.799 --> 18:24.703
So my Sushi is rice.

18:24.704 --> 18:29.040
Yasuda, he still trains,
though his fighting days are

18:29.041 --> 18:29.309
over.

18:29.310 --> 18:35.547
He says he was tired
of hurting people.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.916
He brings me to try and show me

18:37.917 --> 18:40.085
how his Sushi technique and

18:40.086 --> 18:48.086
karate are one in the same.

19:01.574 --> 19:09.574
Yuki Kamio, the master.

19:15.121 --> 19:15.388
Nice.

19:15.389 --> 19:17.189
People ask me, what's the

19:17.190 --> 19:21.427
point between the
karate and the Sushi?

19:21.428 --> 19:23.462
But this movement
is so much good

19:23.463 --> 19:27.065
for when I make my Sushi.

19:27.066 --> 19:33.104
Because of the stance.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.606
The stance is more upper.

19:34.607 --> 19:41.447
So this karate
stance is more deep.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.148
So stand in front of the cutting

19:43.149 --> 19:47.453
board, a deep stance
and movement.

19:47.454 --> 19:54.793
Deep stance and body and
watch, through the right.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.928
Move this, move this.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.631
Watch this and watch this.

19:59.632 --> 20:04.903
This is the key.

20:04.904 --> 20:12.904
So this karate is
my Sushi stance.

20:26.459 --> 20:29.795
Now, in an official tournament,
two-minute rounds.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.330
Two-minute round.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.366
And the result you are
looking for is points?

20:34.367 --> 20:38.804
Points, or knockdown.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.005
But two minutes fight.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.807
One minutes fight.

20:41.808 --> 20:46.278
That's most hardest.

20:46.279 --> 20:46.713
It's underground.

20:46.714 --> 20:48.380
You can just work on their legs

20:48.381 --> 20:50.549
for five, seven minutes
to slow them down.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.618
Then you go in.

20:52.619 --> 20:53.320
Yes.

20:53.321 --> 20:55.120
And not compromise.

20:55.121 --> 20:55.722
Just do it.

20:55.723 --> 21:00.158
Whatever happen, no excuse.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.027

If it's bad, try again.

21:03.696 --> 21:06.865
Don't give up.

21:06.866 --> 21:10.168
Right.

21:10.169 --> 21:14.473

couldn't draw penises, you
couldn't draw specifically

30:38.304 --> 30:39.238
orifices.

30:39.238 --> 30:40.072
You couldn't actually show

30:40.073 --> 30:41.973
humans penetrating each other.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.074
In Japan.

30:43.075 --> 30:43.943
Right.

30:43.944 --> 30:46.111
It was a big no-no at that time.

30:46.112 --> 30:52.417
So I invented tentacles to
be evasive about the law.

30:52.418 --> 30:53.818
Also demons.

30:53.819 --> 30:56.487
Demons.

30:56.488 --> 31:03.094
That's fantastic.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.495
Whether you meant to at the

31:04.496 --> 31:06.431
time, you absolutely changed
the world of manga.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.466
You created an entire spectrum

31:08.467 --> 31:10.835
of pornography that
didn't exist before.

31:10.836 --> 31:16.407
If you go to YouTube now,
there's tentacle manga.

31:16.408 --> 31:17.976
Tentacle and demon manga.

31:17.977 --> 31:24.182
There is tentacle
and demon anime.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.350
A lot.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.918
That looks good.

31:26.919 --> 31:31.456
For dinner, there's fresh bonito

31:31.457 --> 31:32.924
seared quickly over flame,

31:32.925 --> 31:36.361
arranged in bite-sized pieces,

31:36.362 --> 31:41.532
garnished with fresh greens,
sprouts and ponzu.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.668
He comes here commonly for the

31:43.669 --> 31:45.336
favorite of sumo wrestlers as

31:45.337 --> 31:47.472
part of a weight gain diet.

31:47.473 --> 31:50.841
Basically it's a hot pod
of meat and vegetables.

31:50.842 --> 31:54.645
Chicken, pork, beef, fish bowls

31:54.646 --> 31:57.348
keep getting fed into the pot.

31:57.349 --> 32:05.349
Usually alongside
much beer and rice.

32:08.995 --> 32:12.964
So, appealing to the human
desires of a manga-buying

32:12.965 --> 32:16.067
audience, men want filthier,
dirtier, more violent?

32:16.068 --> 32:21.506
In Japan, you can't
be rude in public.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.541
But you need to just, you know,

32:23.542 --> 32:25.810
I can say that
letting off steam.

32:25.811 --> 32:30.381
So for me, the manga
is one way to do that.

32:30.382 --> 32:32.883
What do women want?

32:32.884 --> 32:37.855
Generally speaking, what
do women want in manga?

32:37.856 --> 32:42.193
Yaui.

32:42.194 --> 32:42.494
Boys.

32:42.495 --> 32:43.561
Because they don't have enough

32:43.562 --> 32:46.164
experience to do
that with real men.

32:46.165 --> 32:47.066
But nobody's going to the

32:47.067 --> 32:52.670
fish market and asking
for live octopus.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.605
Probably not.

32:54.606 --> 32:55.874
Probably not.

33:10.689 --> 33:12.557
The pop music scene in Tokyo

33:12.558 --> 33:13.958
is not that different than ours.

33:13.959 --> 33:15.626
With an accent, though, on

33:15.627 --> 33:22.800
pretty boy bands, pop
idols, tween stars.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.902
Generic, industry-created
crap, for the most part.

different than us.

no hint of a record deal.

40:10.443 --> 40:13.644
27 years.

40:13.645 --> 40:14.679
27 years in New York.

40:14.680 --> 40:15.780

Very much.

40:43.475 --> 40:49.046

40:49.047 --> 40:51.381
From my perspective these are

40:51.382 --> 40:51.983
completely different cities.

40:51.984 --> 40:58.556
Even building to building.

40:58.557 --> 41:01.659
Nightclub for men, nightclub for

41:01.660 --> 41:07.532
girls, nightclub for rock
and rollers, hair salon.

41:28.253 --> 41:29.554
What is strange?

41:29.555 --> 41:36.527
What do those things
even mean, anyway?

41:36.528 --> 41:38.563
Sure a lot of what you've seen

41:38.564 --> 41:40.330
looks different from
maybe the mainstream.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.199
It's certainly different from

41:41.200 --> 41:42.900
the way we like to portray

41:42.901 --> 41:46.737
ourselves, see ourselves, at
least our daytime selves.

41:46.738 --> 41:49.740
But roughly 50% of all movies

41:49.741 --> 41:53.944
rented in American hotel
rooms are adult films.

41:53.945 --> 41:55.379
The American important industry

41:55.380 --> 41:57.648
catering to exactly the kind of

41:57.649 --> 41:59.216
dark urges we've been talking

41:59.217 --> 42:01.919
about but even nastier is a $12

42:01.920 --> 42:03.754
billion a year industry that

42:03.755 --> 42:06.824
dwarves the Hollywood product.

Our own obsessions arguably are

42:09.127 --> 42:13.798
at least as crazy, violent,
and lurid as Japan's.

42:13.799 --> 42:16.066

42:16.067 --> 42:19.670
out our violent fantasies
more frequently.

42:19.671 --> 42:21.906
Maybe with that fetishism, that

42:21.907 --> 42:24.742
attention to detail comes some

42:24.743 --> 42:26.644
kind of excellence
in other fields.

42:26.645 --> 42:30.581
Maybe there's a line
from there to here.

42:30.582 --> 42:33.984
