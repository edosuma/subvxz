You know sometimes a 21 minute
15 second episode of Broad City

00:03.515 --> 00:06.170
isn't enough of the world
of Broad City for me.

00:06.177 --> 00:07.209
No, me neither.

00:07.216 --> 00:09.652
Right after this episode you

00:09.659 --> 00:13.070
exclusive footage of how
our show Broad City is made.

00:13.077 --> 00:15.698
It is like a behind the
curtain look at Broad City.

00:15.705 --> 00:18.204
Very informative and
you're gonna dig it.

00:18.211 --> 00:20.551

Can't you get the air up a little bit?

00:31.202 --> 00:32.962
(ELIOT) Mom, don't call him driver.

00:32.969 --> 00:35.054
Yeah, they call this security, this guy.

00:35.061 --> 00:37.046
Like, he's gonna stop anybody, huh?

00:37.053 --> 00:38.529
Esther Baumgarten?

00:38.536 --> 00:40.931
No. No, that's my mother. She's dead.

00:41.126 --> 00:43.342
- Huh?
- Dead! She's dead!

00:43.444 --> 00:44.977
Okay, go ahead.

(BOBBI) God, I needed to be slapped
in the face with this Vitamin D.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.182
I could feel my mustache lightening.

00:50.189 --> 00:52.537
Yup, you told us and the TSA guy.

00:52.544 --> 00:54.910
Oh, please, you're just grumpy
'cause you lost your luggage.

00:54.917 --> 00:57.060
Yeah, I got this amazing suitcase

00:57.067 --> 00:59.219

Oh, Eliot, I am so sorry for your loss.

01:05.752 --> 01:07.561
(BOBBI) It's insane that
didn't do carry-on.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.201
But, look, I had to check.

01:09.208 --> 01:11.098
I had my shampoo and my conditioner.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.572

Okay, so can you help me
put on this 100 SPF?

that need to wear 100 SPF

to be so [BLEEP] hard?

are Richard Pryor's dick,

06:03.753 --> 06:05.018

longer to [BLEEP].

we can say, "We did that!
We lived there!"

08:30.530 --> 08:32.563
Ab, we're doing this.

08:32.666 --> 08:34.265
We're moving to Florida. (BOTH LAUGHING)

08:34.996 --> 08:36.195
Oh, my gosh, okay.

08:36.359 --> 08:38.197
If we're gonna impress
all these old people,

08:38.203 --> 08:39.434
we got a lot of work to do.

08:39.442 --> 08:42.243
Oof, it is net-twerking time, gaga.

08:43.861 --> 08:45.268
Great serve, Edna!

08:45.275 --> 08:46.408
Great return, Ethel.

08:46.987 --> 08:49.139
That was out! I win, bitch!

08:49.146 --> 08:50.812
Oh, shove it, Edna.

08:50.914 --> 08:52.814
That was on the line and you know it.

08:52.916 --> 08:55.483
Girls, you saw it. You make the call.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.237
I can't tell who has more
power in the community.

08:58.255 --> 08:59.590
Um...

09:00.257 --> 09:03.591
Well, Edna looks like she's
wearing a really expensive skirt.

09:03.694 --> 09:05.493
Could mean that she's, like, elite.

09:05.595 --> 09:06.828
Right.

09:06.930 --> 09:08.096
But Ethel's so [BLEEP] bossy.

09:08.103 --> 09:10.088
I feel like she'd force
people to vote for us.

09:10.095 --> 09:11.623
She's like a cyberbully IRL.

09:11.630 --> 09:13.835
So, like a bully.

09:13.937 --> 09:15.804
Huh. I forgot about bullies.

09:15.906 --> 09:17.183
You know what?

09:17.190 --> 09:20.057
I don't think we can choose.
We need both votes.

09:20.510 --> 09:22.277
You won, but you should let her win.

09:22.379 --> 09:23.445
She needs it more.

09:23.452 --> 09:25.106
She needs it more.

09:25.113 --> 09:27.138

I got to [BLEEP] JFK and she didn't.

09:41.698 --> 09:42.997
Wow...

09:44.908 --> 09:46.062
Wow.

09:46.069 --> 09:47.802
I do owe her one.

09:47.809 --> 09:50.577
She [BLEEP] JFK so I wouldn't have to.

09:50.584 --> 09:52.769

have been, like, nurses

various dudes driving ambulances

16:30.840 --> 16:32.073
Thank you.

16:38.594 --> 16:39.760
So, when we were kids,

16:39.949 --> 16:41.382
Grandma Esther and Grandpa Zayde

16:41.389 --> 16:43.439
used to take us
to the Catskills every summer.

16:43.446 --> 16:45.248
And the men would stay home
during the week.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.021
They'd come up
on the weekends to join us.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.298
So, one summer, Bev and I stole

16:49.305 --> 16:52.106
Grandma Esther's diet pills...
Speed, you know, we took it.

16:52.113 --> 16:53.779
And we're trying
to hide it from Grandma.

16:53.786 --> 16:55.418
But she spotted us immediately

16:55.425 --> 16:57.320
'cause she was high on speed herself,

16:57.327 --> 16:58.526
so then... (LAUGHING)

16:59.929 --> 17:01.229
So then... (LAUGHING)

17:01.259 --> 17:03.387
we just ended up in the middle
of the night, you know,

17:03.394 --> 17:05.461
in that tiny, little bungalow kitchen

17:05.468 --> 17:07.730
till 3:00 in the morning
grinding our teeth.

17:07.737 --> 17:09.232
And we never told Daddy.

17:09.239 --> 17:12.874
No, we never told Daddy.

17:12.991 --> 17:16.092
You know, I lost my virginity
in that little bungalow.

17:16.098 --> 17:18.708
No, you didn't. You lost
your virginity to Jerry Katz

17:18.714 --> 17:22.083
- the year after I went to college.
- Unh-unh, I lied.

17:22.185 --> 17:25.920
I lost my virginity to Neil Friedman

17:26.021 --> 17:27.683
in that bungalow

17:27.690 --> 17:30.992
while all of you were sleeping
the summer I was 15.

17:31.094 --> 17:32.894
Wait a minute, Neil Friedman?

17:32.996 --> 17:35.763
Wasn't he the one
with the scoliosis brace?

17:35.865 --> 17:36.998
Uh-huh.

17:38.368 --> 17:39.901
I was so petrified

17:40.003 --> 17:42.136
that I was gonna wake all of youse up

17:42.238 --> 17:45.306
because it kept bangin'
against the headboard.

17:45.408 --> 17:48.376
(LOUD LAUGHTER)

17:51.681 --> 17:52.947

17:53.049 --> 17:55.917
Oh, Beverly, you know what? (LAUGHING)

17:56.019 --> 17:57.718
You take the ring.

17:57.820 --> 18:01.355
No, Bobbi, you take it.

18:01.457 --> 18:03.357
No, you take it, Bev. Who could care?

18:03.459 --> 18:06.761
It's just a material possession.
It doesn't mean anything.

18:06.863 --> 18:08.691
Oh, my God, Mom,
you need to smoke more often,

18:08.698 --> 18:10.398
like, every damn day.

18:15.571 --> 18:18.306
I do need to change
my Facebook profile pic.

18:18.408 --> 18:20.474
I see that now, you know?
It's just hard.

18:20.576 --> 18:22.143
Sometimes I wanna be one of those people

18:22.245 --> 18:24.478
that just, like, deletes
Facebook altogether.

18:24.547 --> 18:26.430
- Yeah.
- And than I can always tell everyone

18:26.437 --> 18:28.244
I deleted Facebook.

18:28.251 --> 18:31.118
But then I'd miss all the baby pics.

18:32.588 --> 18:34.855
Babies. Mmm...

18:34.862 --> 18:36.297
You know what, speaking of Facebook,

18:36.304 --> 18:37.892
and I wasn't gonna say anything.

18:37.994 --> 18:39.460
But, you know, now I'm stoned.

18:39.562 --> 18:41.395
I'm gonna spill the beans.

18:41.497 --> 18:44.665
I saw earlier on Facebook
that, uh, Lincoln

18:44.767 --> 18:47.168
changed his status to single.

18:52.508 --> 18:55.476
Cool. Cool.

18:55.578 --> 18:56.744
Hey...

18:56.846 --> 18:58.746
Ilana, where did you
get this pot anyway?

18:58.848 --> 19:00.448
- I brought it.
- On the plane? How?

19:00.550 --> 19:01.916
- In my pussy.

19:02.018 --> 19:03.250

- Ew.

19:03.353 --> 19:04.919
I knew, it's a thing.

19:05.021 --> 19:06.988
Oh, big freakin' deal.

19:07.090 --> 19:08.456
She came out of you.

19:08.558 --> 19:10.925
