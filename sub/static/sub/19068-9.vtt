WEBVTT

00:01.363 --> 00:02.917
<i>Previously on "Dracula"...</i>

00:03.166 --> 00:05.596
Your man, Hackett, he attacked Mina.

00:05.789 --> 00:08.157
Who sent you here?
It was Grayson, wasn't it?

00:10.761 --> 00:13.364
I belong to you,
and you belong to me.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.868
I love you, Mina.

00:16.363 --> 00:17.716
You need to leave.

00:17.841 --> 00:19.608
Someone should teach her such pain.

00:19.912 --> 00:20.957
Jonathan.

00:23.340 --> 00:25.743
The Order burned my wife
and children.

00:26.302 --> 00:27.712
I will have my revenge.

00:28.603 --> 00:29.517
The children!

00:34.180 --> 00:37.488
Welcome, Mr. Harker,
to the Order of the Dragon.

00:38.883 --> 00:40.117
Grayson's technology is a dead end.

00:40.420 --> 00:43.561
- We need your help.
- You'd have me play Judas.

00:43.957 --> 00:48.997
Ladies and gentlemen, this machine is
a threat to public safety. Shut it down.

00:49.295 --> 00:51.636
There is another elder vampire
in London.

00:52.099 --> 00:55.540
<i>He's infested London with
creatures, answering his call.</i>

00:56.028 --> 00:57.877
- Who called you?
- Dracula.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.067
If it's a war they want, then
it's a war they're gonna get.

01:33.610 --> 01:36.347
These arrogant bastards
have sealed their own fate.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.197
Now, they'll see the violence
I can reap.

01:38.448 --> 01:40.184
Sir, you insist the Order
was behind the attack

01:40.421 --> 01:43.205
on Miss Murray, when
not a fortnight ago, you concluded

01:43.330 --> 01:46.517
that my abduction was the work
of a rogue element within their ranks.

01:46.683 --> 01:49.360
- This is different.
- No, this is the same. The woman...

01:49.643 --> 01:52.196
Janina Kleiberson,
a known contractor to the Order.

01:52.803 --> 01:55.700
Repeatedly asked me
what it was you loved.

01:55.923 --> 01:58.770
Then, the triptych...
A painting of your wife, yes,

01:59.043 --> 02:01.019
but the very image
of Mina Murray was stolen

02:01.305 --> 02:03.574
and then recovered
from Lord Davenport's study.

02:03.740 --> 02:05.476
Recovered? When?

02:05.683 --> 02:09.116
Tonight. Some agents of mine
will be delivering it this very evening,

02:09.241 --> 02:10.514
and will you please let me finish?

02:10.681 --> 02:12.350
- I thought you had.
- It was Davenport,

02:12.516 --> 02:13.997
not the Order, who ordered my attack,

02:14.318 --> 02:17.722
stole the triptych, and it was
his men who attacked miss Murray.

02:17.963 --> 02:18.870
Your point?

02:18.995 --> 02:20.717
This was a personal vendetta
against you,

02:20.883 --> 02:24.228
completely unrelated to his position
in the Order of the Dragon.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.957
No. This stinks of High Council.

02:27.598 --> 02:30.357
Their cowardly tactic of attacking
the wives and children of their enemies.

02:30.601 --> 02:33.371
- Sir, I know...
- To attack her with acid...

02:33.537 --> 02:37.408
To obliterate her beauty,
to disfigure her...

02:37.574 --> 02:41.197
This is not the act of one man seeking
vengeance for his son's death,

02:41.363 --> 02:44.538
but a pack of vandals
I know all too well.

02:46.650 --> 02:49.634
The time for stealth
and scheming has passed.

02:50.387 --> 02:53.434
From this night and every night
until they yield...

02:54.163 --> 02:56.178
Blood will flow.

03:14.883 --> 03:17.117
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

03:17.648 --> 03:19.484
You're needed
at Carfax Manor immediately.

03:19.683 --> 03:22.224
I don't think you quite understand
the situation, Professor.

03:22.349 --> 03:26.628
On the contrary, Mr. Renfield.
It is you who does not understand.

03:27.665 --> 03:30.795
Put quite simply, your client
and I had a contract.

03:30.961 --> 03:34.665
I would provide technical skills,
he would promote that technology.

03:34.831 --> 03:37.717
And together, you and he
would destroy your common enemy.

03:38.335 --> 03:43.141
Would have, had your client restrained
his passion to be human, but he did not,

03:43.843 --> 03:46.677
and in the process, he lost
possession of the resonator.

03:46.883 --> 03:51.315
And now, our plan has failed,
and the contract is broken.

03:51.558 --> 03:53.251
Now, please, if you will excuse me...

03:53.493 --> 03:56.554
He intends to take
direct action against the Order.

03:56.797 --> 03:58.789
Professor, he's quite beside himself.

03:59.003 --> 04:02.258
- You really must speak with him.
- Mr. Renfield.

04:04.204 --> 04:07.629
What your client chooses to do
is no longer my concern.

04:18.808 --> 04:23.813
They're arriving. Every huntsman of note
from every chapter house in Europe.

04:24.114 --> 04:26.350
Oh, we're going to sweep
across London,

04:26.516 --> 04:31.477
root out every one of the swine,
and butcher them in their lairs.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.797
What's wrong?

04:36.625 --> 04:38.831
My children have been abducted.

04:41.163 --> 04:44.556
Clear the room.
Now.

04:45.402 --> 04:46.841
Come along.

04:57.883 --> 04:59.688
It's linked to all of this.

05:03.186 --> 05:07.225
Our men recovered that while they
were sanitizing Davenport's house.

05:07.391 --> 05:10.134
His son, Daniel, wrote it.
It's clearly a suicide note.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.990
Daniel and Lord Laurent were lovers?

05:13.430 --> 05:15.761
Alexander Grayson is not only
a cunning businessman,

05:15.886 --> 05:18.030
he is a criminal mastermind,
prepared to cheat,

05:18.155 --> 05:20.371
blackmail, or murder anyone
who stands in his way.

05:20.757 --> 05:23.708
But why? Now, why would he
abduct your children?

05:23.874 --> 05:25.409
How could that possibly
further his ends?

05:25.603 --> 05:27.578
His ends are not what they seem.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.948
This energy scheme of his is merely
a means to a very different end,

05:31.114 --> 05:33.050
and that is the destruction
of this organization.

05:33.403 --> 05:35.997
Since he arrived in London,
we have been under attack...

05:36.186 --> 05:38.256
Individual members,
our financial security,

05:38.523 --> 05:40.717
and now, my children.

05:40.891 --> 05:43.494
But what motive does Grayson have?

05:43.660 --> 05:46.664
Grayson has none, but Dracula,

05:46.883 --> 05:48.699
that is a different matter entirely.

05:49.464 --> 05:52.036
This infestation
is merely a distraction,

05:52.611 --> 05:54.705
a feinting maneuver
that allows him to strike us

05:55.280 --> 05:57.642
at will in the guise
of Alexander Grayson.

05:58.163 --> 06:01.945
Surely you can't still believe
that Grayson is a vampire.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.317
You've seen him in broad
daylight with your own eyes.

06:06.645 --> 06:09.677
Perhaps he's found some way
to protect himself...

06:10.854 --> 06:12.934
Some sorcery.

06:14.257 --> 06:16.170
Listen to yourself.

06:16.860 --> 06:19.037
This is insanity.

06:20.445 --> 06:22.900
Or more importantly,
it is off the point.

06:23.283 --> 06:25.903
We face a threat
of biblical proportions.

06:26.069 --> 06:27.297
I'm aware of that, but Grayson...

06:27.422 --> 06:29.440
Grayson will be dealt with
in due course,

06:30.003 --> 06:32.877
but for now, I must demand your
full attention on this crisis.

06:33.363 --> 06:37.209
- But my children...
- Must I quote the Primary Oath?

07:26.095 --> 07:27.647
Jonathan.

07:41.610 --> 07:43.181
Mr. Harker...?

07:50.352 --> 07:51.846
Lucy?

07:55.803 --> 07:57.419
What have you done?

08:25.624 --> 08:27.424
Season 1, Episode 9 "Four Roses"

08:27.549 --> 08:30.237
Synced by err0001 & Reef
www.addic7ed.com

08:30.643 --> 08:32.990
Search the carriage house
and any outbuildings or sheds.

08:33.115 --> 08:35.388
Lassiter,
check the servants' quarters,

08:35.513 --> 08:37.101
and send two men up
to check on the attic!

08:37.267 --> 08:38.969
- Right you are, sir.
- Are you charge here?

08:39.135 --> 08:41.037
Yes, I am, and who may you be?

08:41.304 --> 08:44.306
R. M. Renfield, esquire.
I'm Mr. Grayson's attorney.

08:44.723 --> 08:46.538
I presume you have a warrant.

08:46.910 --> 08:49.277
Signed by a magistrate.
Everything's in order.

08:53.003 --> 08:53.951
Hardly.

08:54.117 --> 08:57.016
There's no mention of what it is
you're searching for.

08:57.721 --> 08:59.541
Without it, this is invalid.

09:00.023 --> 09:03.477
I demand you remove yourself and your
men from these premises immediately.

09:04.861 --> 09:05.757
Or what?

09:07.012 --> 09:10.037
Or I shall be forced to press
charges of criminal trespassing.

09:13.035 --> 09:14.317
Sorry.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.218
And vandalism.

09:17.707 --> 09:20.717
Perhaps I should arrest you
for obstructing an investigation.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.874
An investigation into what, exactly?

09:25.243 --> 09:27.757
They're looking
for my children, Mr. Renfield.

09:29.686 --> 09:31.922
Be that as it may, sir,
they shall have to desist

09:32.304 --> 09:34.622
until they return with
a properly executed warrant.

09:34.747 --> 09:35.637
Nonsense.

09:37.476 --> 09:39.418
I've already informed
inspector Salinger

09:39.678 --> 09:41.499
that his men are free
to search this property,

09:41.624 --> 09:43.858
if only to speed their investigation.

09:45.443 --> 09:47.637
You'll find no children
at Carfax, Mr. Browning.

09:47.980 --> 09:50.877
Although I've often longed
for their laughter...

09:51.675 --> 09:54.117
And the pitter-patter of tiny feet.

10:05.503 --> 10:07.969
I'm sorry to have wasted your
time, but I have my reasons.

10:08.094 --> 10:09.960
No, no, nothing
to apologize for, sir.

10:10.354 --> 10:12.418
As far as I'm concerned,
this is just a start.

10:12.896 --> 10:15.766
Commissioner's got half the met
under my command on this.

10:15.932 --> 10:17.157
We will find your children.

10:17.367 --> 10:20.477
Thank you, Inspector.
My poor wife is beside herself.

10:20.970 --> 10:23.797
Yes. Yes, I'm sure she is.
Best you look after her.

10:24.007 --> 10:25.943
I'll contact you personally
if anything comes up.

10:26.109 --> 10:28.859
- Be it good or bad.
- Yes, sir.

10:33.923 --> 10:36.802
- Harker.
- Shush. Get in, quickly.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.437
This is what happens
when you're vile.

10:44.160 --> 10:47.180
You assume your enemies
would sink to similar tactics.

10:48.904 --> 10:50.000
Disgusting.

10:50.323 --> 10:53.887
- You don't suppose Van Helsing...
- Abducted Browning's children?

10:54.503 --> 10:55.306
Doubtful.

10:56.026 --> 11:00.178
The man's a martinet,
enslaved to his own scheme.

11:00.810 --> 11:04.155
He'd rather self-immolate than stray
from that rut he calls a path.

11:04.881 --> 11:06.511
I wouldn't be so sure
about that, sir.

11:07.203 --> 11:09.320
He said himself he considered
your partnership over.

11:09.563 --> 11:11.168
Did he?

11:11.855 --> 11:13.869
And when did he tell you this?

11:16.163 --> 11:20.397
I thought it prudent
to inform him of your plan

11:20.744 --> 11:23.458
to directly engage the Order, sir.

11:23.716 --> 11:24.762
Really?

11:25.135 --> 11:27.197
Did you think it prudent, Renfield?

11:27.837 --> 11:29.779
Am I now your charge,
and you my caretaker?

11:29.904 --> 11:31.157
No, sir, I o...

11:34.693 --> 11:37.338
You're quite right, sir.
I overstepped my bounds.

11:38.923 --> 11:41.597
I assure you,
it will not happen again.

11:54.230 --> 11:56.239
That was Alastair.

11:57.066 --> 11:59.319
I told him
you've been feeling unwell.

12:00.904 --> 12:02.037
He's worried about you.

12:10.546 --> 12:12.357
Please, Lucy.

12:13.249 --> 12:15.597
You must tell me what's going on.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.957
I know I'm not as sophisticated
or modern as Jayne Wetherby, but...

12:20.833 --> 12:22.985
I'm not a complete fool.

12:26.395 --> 12:28.037
Darling...

12:29.966 --> 12:30.997
Please tell me.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.594
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Tell you what?

12:43.744 --> 12:47.467
That it's perfectly natural for a woman
to fall in love with another woman.

12:49.052 --> 12:50.629
To what?

12:51.621 --> 12:53.197
For me and Mina to...

12:55.158 --> 12:56.378
What are you saying?

13:00.095 --> 13:02.041
Oh, my God.

13:10.038 --> 13:11.685
That's far enough.
Pull over here.

13:12.008 --> 13:14.237
Whoa! Whoa.

13:18.081 --> 13:20.670
I've decided to accept your offer...

13:22.652 --> 13:24.370
Pending your answer to one question.

13:25.955 --> 13:26.924
And that is?

13:27.163 --> 13:28.959
Why did the Order attack Mina Murray?

13:29.203 --> 13:31.877
Attack? Your fiancée?
That's ridiculous.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.717
We're trying to recruit you,
not make an enemy of you.

13:35.144 --> 13:36.397
Davenport was behind it.

13:38.301 --> 13:41.314
If he was, then I assure you,
it was unsanctioned.

13:42.138 --> 13:44.553
Had we known about it,
he would've been...

13:49.064 --> 13:50.317
<i>You</i> killed him.

13:53.687 --> 13:56.427
You are full of surprises,
Mr. Harker.

13:57.186 --> 14:00.544
- Will I be punished?
- By us? Good God, no.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.293
Rogue actions are not tolerated
within the ranks,

14:03.459 --> 14:06.138
especially when they run
counter to our objectives.

14:07.030 --> 14:09.918
Besides, I never did much care
for Davenport.

14:13.384 --> 14:16.637
I trust I've answered your
question to your satisfaction.

14:17.704 --> 14:18.909
You have.

14:19.566 --> 14:22.562
Then, welcome, Mr. Harker...

14:24.243 --> 14:26.216
To the Order of the Dragon.

14:48.683 --> 14:51.529
<i>The first thing we need you
to do, Mr. Harker,</i>

14:52.141 --> 14:54.877
<i>is bring us the blueprints
of Grayson's resonator.</i>

15:09.458 --> 15:13.252
Mr. Harker, I didn't know
you were still here.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.046
I was just catching up
on some correspondence.

15:20.402 --> 15:22.701
Will Alexander be needing
anything else tonight?

15:23.139 --> 15:24.140
I doubt it.

15:24.683 --> 15:27.599
He just left, and I suspect
he will be quite late.

15:30.698 --> 15:32.981
Well, then, I suppose
I'll be off as well.

15:34.217 --> 15:35.381
Mr. Harker?

15:36.386 --> 15:37.197
Yes?

15:39.483 --> 15:41.625
If you could, please convey

15:42.363 --> 15:45.037
my and Mr. Grayson's
warmest regards to Miss Murray.

15:47.696 --> 15:48.991
I'll do that.

16:05.318 --> 16:06.571
What are you doing here?

16:07.183 --> 16:09.186
Renfield tells me
that you're under the impression

16:09.455 --> 16:11.154
that our partnership
has come to an end.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.244
I see no alternative.

16:13.856 --> 16:18.764
Your inability to control yourself
has completely derailed our scheme.

16:20.096 --> 16:22.597
Not if I regain possession
of the resonator.

16:27.997 --> 16:29.292
One demonstration,

16:30.139 --> 16:33.551
and the Order Draco will be
rendered bankrupt, as planned.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.468
Yes, Renfield told me.

16:37.323 --> 16:38.503
Another bloodbath.

16:39.115 --> 16:43.208
Calling it a strategy does not
make it any less a compulsion.

16:43.843 --> 16:46.490
Professor, you wouldn't
happen to know anything

16:47.283 --> 16:50.111
about the disappearance
of Browning's two children?

16:53.228 --> 16:55.253
- What is it to you?
- Nothing.

16:55.865 --> 16:58.990
Only that it places undue scrutiny
on our activities by the authorities,

16:59.944 --> 17:01.997
and if our plan should fail
as a result,

17:02.305 --> 17:04.231
I'll hold you solely responsible.

17:05.374 --> 17:06.897
And then, Abraham...

17:07.522 --> 17:11.531
You're going to have
a very, very bad day.

17:14.415 --> 17:18.837
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I'm dining with friends tonight.

18:51.283 --> 18:53.612
Papa! Papa! Papa!

18:54.450 --> 18:55.477
Papa! Papa!

19:40.698 --> 19:41.951
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:51.339 --> 19:54.631
Ah, billiards.

19:56.978 --> 20:00.637
Grayson, I had no idea
you were a member.

20:03.351 --> 20:04.517
Rothcroft, isn't it?

20:06.289 --> 20:08.713
I do hope you'll pardon
the interruption.

20:09.563 --> 20:11.311
Relatives of mine from the continent.

20:12.028 --> 20:14.957
I invited them to London with
the promise that the cuisine here is...

20:15.633 --> 20:16.700
Excellent.

20:21.570 --> 20:22.957
Aren't you American?

20:30.963 --> 20:32.557
<i>Bon appétit,</i> boys.

21:31.640 --> 21:32.957
Sleep.

21:36.650 --> 21:38.357
They're from you.

21:42.918 --> 21:44.218
Yes.

21:46.755 --> 21:47.730
I thought...

21:48.644 --> 21:51.037
- I thought Jonathan...
- No.

21:55.153 --> 21:57.529
- You were there.
- Where?

21:58.501 --> 22:02.598
- You stopped those men.
- Don't think about it, ever.

22:03.083 --> 22:05.501
None of those men
will ever touch you again.

22:05.787 --> 22:06.610
I know.

22:07.043 --> 22:08.797
Whatever you think happened
didn't happen.

22:09.845 --> 22:11.117
I wasn't there.

22:12.815 --> 22:13.917
I was at Carfax.

22:14.680 --> 22:15.681
No.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.237
No, you were there.

22:27.762 --> 22:29.246
I have to go.

22:29.994 --> 22:34.731
Please... please, will you stay
a little longer?

22:40.742 --> 22:41.643
I can't.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.957
You don't know
how much I want to, but...

22:47.883 --> 22:48.637
I can't.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.521
Why?

22:52.821 --> 22:54.764
I'm sorry.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.732
I believe they call this
a declaration of war.

23:26.283 --> 23:27.351
It's astonishing.

23:27.476 --> 23:29.239
No effort to conceal the bodies
whatsoever.

23:30.203 --> 23:33.637
Nor the cause.
It's bold, brazen, flamboyant.

23:40.305 --> 23:41.558
I've never seen its like.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.788
- And these men?
- Known associates from the Yard.

23:46.509 --> 23:49.292
This evening's edition will
report how these five gentlemen

23:50.000 --> 23:53.757
were part
of a tragic yachting mishap...

23:55.175 --> 23:56.197
Lost at sea.

24:00.158 --> 24:02.749
Only the Fell One would dare
to orchestrate a slaughter like this.

24:03.043 --> 24:04.445
- Mr. Browning.
- Inspector?

24:04.803 --> 24:05.804
Yes, sir.

24:06.095 --> 24:07.697
It seems I've wasted your time.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.557
I've just had word from my wife's
sister that my children are with her.

24:11.834 --> 24:13.517
An errant telegram,
a terrible mix-up.

24:14.083 --> 24:15.638
- They're safe then?
- Safe and sound.

24:15.804 --> 24:18.409
- I can't tell you how embarrassed I am.
- No, no. Say no more, sir.

24:19.163 --> 24:20.791
- Better to be safe than sorry.
- Yes.

24:21.535 --> 24:23.913
Now, if you don't mind, I'd like
a quiet word with my colleagues.

24:24.495 --> 24:26.194
Of course, sir.
All right, men.

24:36.661 --> 24:38.241
Mr. Browning, this is Kaha Ruma.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.197
He's descended from Maori warriors,
one of our leading huntsmen.

24:42.131 --> 24:45.117
- Your reputation precedes you, sir.
- Pleasure.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.851
- I've summoned the Sicilian.
- Loiza Scaverra?

24:48.337 --> 24:50.301
You'll need a good seer.
He's the best.

24:50.426 --> 24:52.363
Cardinal Valachi
from the Vatican chapter's

24:52.675 --> 24:55.877
also agreed to lend us
the <i>Sanguinem Sanctorum</i>.

24:57.560 --> 24:58.877
A most sacred relic.

25:02.583 --> 25:04.220
Mr. Browning, your children, sir?

25:04.386 --> 25:07.757
Still missing, but we can't
have the police bungling about,

25:07.923 --> 25:10.449
and God help us
if the press get a hold of it.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.845
You were right to question
my judgment about Grayson.

25:15.331 --> 25:16.957
I was distraught.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.184
- That said, he's still a threat to us.
- It's no doubt, sir.

25:21.936 --> 25:24.609
Therefore, while you deal with
this infestation, I shall deal with him.

25:25.207 --> 25:27.757
In the meantime,
if there's anything you need,

25:28.443 --> 25:31.117
anything at all,
I am at your service.

25:31.914 --> 25:33.677
Above all, this must be contained,

25:34.434 --> 25:36.517
no matter what the personal cost
to any of us.

25:49.797 --> 25:50.597
Lucy...

25:55.563 --> 25:56.564
Oh, God.

25:57.139 --> 25:58.874
What have they done to you?

26:00.843 --> 26:02.797
- How could they?
- I don't know.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.837
I'm still so confused.

26:06.594 --> 26:07.477
Oh, Mina.

26:07.882 --> 26:09.261
- Lucy.
- Yes?

26:09.685 --> 26:12.157
- You're sitting on my hand.
- Oh, God, sorry.

26:12.975 --> 26:14.197
I'm such an oaf.

26:20.161 --> 26:21.249
They're beautiful.

26:23.431 --> 26:24.917
I positively decimated the garden.

26:26.655 --> 26:27.877
Mother will have a fit.

26:33.862 --> 26:35.034
Mina, I'm so sorry.

26:36.683 --> 26:38.295
It's just you're so smart and kind.

26:38.781 --> 26:40.988
I can't imagine anybody would
ever want to hurt you.

26:41.564 --> 26:44.074
Breaks my heart that there are
people in the world who would...

26:44.753 --> 26:46.308
Who would what?

26:47.256 --> 26:48.948
Deliberately...

26:53.115 --> 26:54.421
They're beautiful.

26:55.364 --> 26:56.256
Jonathan?

26:57.120 --> 27:00.684
No, no. I-I haven't seen him since...

27:01.554 --> 27:03.071
Has something happened to him?

27:03.803 --> 27:04.484
No.

27:05.255 --> 27:07.829
No, I mean, not that I know of.

27:10.244 --> 27:12.837
Lucy, tell me the truth.

27:20.015 --> 27:21.501
You must forget about Jonathan.

27:21.880 --> 27:24.808
- What?
- Please don't ask me any questions.

27:25.575 --> 27:28.451
You just have to know he's not
the man you think he is.

27:29.198 --> 27:30.700
You must call off the engagement.

27:30.998 --> 27:33.834
But that's... that's insane.
I-I can't... I can't do that.

27:34.503 --> 27:36.908
- You must.
- Why?

27:37.586 --> 27:38.689
What has he done?

27:41.457 --> 27:42.357
He...

27:45.683 --> 27:47.016
- I can't.
- Lucy...

27:47.182 --> 27:48.914
Don't be ridiculous.
Just tell me.

27:52.121 --> 27:53.397
You're going to hate me.

27:58.993 --> 27:59.917
I'm so sorry, Mina.

28:09.207 --> 28:10.308
- I'm so...
- Don't.

28:11.323 --> 28:12.389
- No...
- Get out!

28:12.954 --> 28:14.188
Get out, get out!

28:29.438 --> 28:32.390
Romanian - "Within a closed circle,
a place without escape"

28:33.843 --> 28:37.083
Romanian - "Within a closed circle,
a place without escape"

28:38.163 --> 28:40.997
Romanian - "Within a closed circle,
a place without escape"

28:47.042 --> 28:48.441
Jonathan Harker...

28:50.072 --> 28:51.835
Are you prepared
to take the Primary Oath

28:52.321 --> 28:54.955
of the Order of the Dragon before
your brethren and before your God?

28:56.373 --> 28:57.374
I am.

29:07.195 --> 29:11.573
I swear on my life and the lives of all
those I love from this day forward,

29:12.218 --> 29:14.675
I will never place my own needs
above those of this sacred Order,

29:15.337 --> 29:16.990
so help me God.

30:28.721 --> 30:31.286
We slaughtered over half
the London Council in a single night.

30:32.523 --> 30:35.397
More blood drawn than in
15 years of cowardly scheming.

30:35.684 --> 30:37.192
It is but one chapter.

30:37.841 --> 30:39.273
There are hundreds more.

30:39.588 --> 30:43.471
Perhaps, yes, but I have
this one in utter panic.

30:44.854 --> 30:47.555
Could you imagine their terror if
I decided to attack in broad daylight?

30:49.055 --> 30:50.635
Sir, that would be inadvisable.

30:52.961 --> 30:55.238
One of the few advantages
we still have over the enemy

30:55.523 --> 30:59.917
is that they do not suspect Dracula and
Alexander Grayson are one in the same.

31:00.142 --> 31:03.118
And if you were to attack by day,
we would lose that advantage.

31:04.046 --> 31:05.181
Where have you been?

31:05.871 --> 31:07.917
Preparing to leave
the country, as should we all.

31:10.062 --> 31:11.854
That's right.

31:12.020 --> 31:14.190
Run, little rabbit, run.

31:14.356 --> 31:16.767
I'm sure your wife and children
would be very proud.

31:17.092 --> 31:20.877
Alexander!
Alexander, I have great news.

31:21.430 --> 31:24.233
The board of Health
ruled in our favor.

31:24.483 --> 31:27.270
They've removed the quarantine.

31:27.523 --> 31:30.064
- Unbelievable.
- Is it, Abraham?

31:30.672 --> 31:34.410
Is it really so surprising that decades
of soft living have neutered our enemies?

31:34.643 --> 31:39.195
It's clear; they no longer have
the stomach for direct confrontation.

31:40.215 --> 31:43.240
- Is everything in order?
- Indeed it appears so.

31:44.198 --> 31:46.983
And so we shall have
our grand demonstration.

31:48.090 --> 31:50.331
I hope you'll attend, Abraham,
if not to assist,

31:51.413 --> 31:54.469
at least to witness our first
decisive victory over the...

31:55.523 --> 31:56.374
Competition.

31:57.877 --> 31:58.878
Yes.

32:00.568 --> 32:01.437
Of course.

32:06.382 --> 32:08.277
Why is he so glum?

32:09.438 --> 32:12.949
You know, Mr. Kowalski,
there are some men in this world

32:13.115 --> 32:16.811
that would rather lose everything
they have than be proven wrong.

32:17.481 --> 32:18.632
Good job.

32:26.385 --> 32:28.464
I've just received word
that the Board of Health...

32:28.630 --> 32:30.992
Has allowed the demonstration
to move forward?

32:31.718 --> 32:35.397
Yes, of course.
How fortuitous for Mr. Grayson.

32:37.104 --> 32:40.797
- You arranged it.
- Not me, Mr. Harker. God.

32:41.476 --> 32:43.279
We are all merely His servants.

32:43.717 --> 32:47.397
Besides, if there is no demonstration,
there can be no failure.

32:50.786 --> 32:53.197
You should know,
Alexander Grayson is a pit bull.

32:54.189 --> 32:57.717
If he fails, he'll simply regroup
and keep trying until he succeeds.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.018
Noted.

33:00.262 --> 33:01.475
Thank you, Mr. Harker.

33:12.339 --> 33:14.917
Dear Lord, this is quite remarkable.

33:15.083 --> 33:16.979
That's all well and good,
but our objective

33:17.201 --> 33:19.354
is to make certain
no one ever attempts this again.

33:19.641 --> 33:21.575
We must engineer a debacle
so thorough

33:21.700 --> 33:25.077
that no one will ever consider
geomagnetism as a viable source of energy.

33:25.243 --> 33:28.257
Well, like any machine, there are
a number of ways to cause it to fail.

33:28.483 --> 33:30.718
I am not interested in failure, sir!

33:31.401 --> 33:32.792
I want a catastrophe!

33:49.210 --> 33:50.581
Doctor!

33:57.785 --> 33:59.477
What are you doing here?

34:02.223 --> 34:03.453
How did you get in?

34:04.459 --> 34:08.355
You gave me a key,
or don't you remember?

34:13.567 --> 34:15.157
Where have you been?

34:16.304 --> 34:17.212
I...

34:17.337 --> 34:20.715
For the last two days,
where have you been?

34:23.413 --> 34:26.181
I... look, I've... I've, um...
I've been meaning to...

34:26.348 --> 34:27.357
Meaning to what?

34:28.550 --> 34:31.355
Stop by?
Visit me in hospital?

34:34.255 --> 34:36.025
I wanted to wait
until you were stronger.

34:37.333 --> 34:38.597
By all means.

34:39.255 --> 34:40.995
Because I'm such
a delicate little thing.

34:41.120 --> 34:43.199
- How very thoughtful of you.
- That's not what I'm saying.

34:43.324 --> 34:44.677
Why, Jonathan?

34:46.467 --> 34:47.190
Lucy?

34:54.362 --> 34:55.937
What...
what did she tell you?

34:56.603 --> 34:58.435
Everything that I needed to know.

34:59.773 --> 35:01.435
Well, I don't suppose she mentioned

35:01.560 --> 35:04.837
that she's been throwing herself
at me for the past two weeks.

35:06.388 --> 35:07.355
You pig.

35:11.403 --> 35:12.755
Don't touch me!

35:15.841 --> 35:17.021
I'm sorry.

35:22.512 --> 35:24.195
Just... just...

35:24.472 --> 35:26.648
Just... just go.
Just go.

35:27.889 --> 35:29.597
You won't hear from me again.

35:34.215 --> 35:35.322
Why?

35:36.818 --> 35:39.315
- Jonathan, why?
- You know why.

35:40.388 --> 35:41.094
No...

35:42.883 --> 35:44.486
I don't.

35:47.895 --> 35:49.275
Because you love Grayson.

36:19.203 --> 36:20.997
Oy! Mind where you're going.

36:27.952 --> 36:29.263
Watch where you're going.

36:29.871 --> 36:30.931
Dear, oh, dear.

36:31.173 --> 36:32.355
Out of my way.

36:56.403 --> 36:58.517
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, steady!

37:27.960 --> 37:28.961
You.

37:29.393 --> 37:31.364
Yes, me.

37:31.769 --> 37:33.757
You keep coming back.

37:35.060 --> 37:36.655
I can't help myself.

37:38.106 --> 37:39.959
I brought you another.

37:40.549 --> 37:43.557
It's beautiful.
Thank you.

37:43.945 --> 37:45.470
What happened?

37:46.047 --> 37:47.760
Uh, I got lost.

37:49.617 --> 37:51.587
The doctor says
you may have a concussion.

37:52.069 --> 37:53.517
Yes.

37:54.823 --> 37:58.550
- Did you wander outside?
- No, I didn't.

37:59.060 --> 38:00.157
I left.

38:01.930 --> 38:03.397
I hate hospitals.

38:04.966 --> 38:07.545
You know, that's gonna be a problem
when you become a doctor.

38:10.073 --> 38:12.877
Don't make me laugh.
That hurts.

38:13.187 --> 38:14.815
- I apologize.
- Oh.

38:20.948 --> 38:21.917
Alexander?

38:25.620 --> 38:28.635
- What's happening between us?
- I don't know.

38:30.492 --> 38:32.334
All I can say is...

38:37.098 --> 38:38.237
Please.

38:39.501 --> 38:40.727
Please go on.

38:43.070 --> 38:45.579
You remind me of somebody
I used to love.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.094
Her name was Ilona.

38:52.713 --> 38:53.837
I know her.

38:55.617 --> 38:57.957
I have dreamed about her
since I was a little girl.

38:58.952 --> 39:00.132
She looks like me.

39:04.425 --> 39:05.691
I saw her tonight.

39:07.228 --> 39:09.437
I saw her
in a reflection in a puddle,

39:09.879 --> 39:12.630
and she reached out to me,
as if she was going to...

39:15.936 --> 39:16.823
I'm here.

39:18.419 --> 39:19.997
I'm right here.

39:28.288 --> 39:30.124
Do you love me?

39:31.953 --> 39:33.822
- Don't ask me that.
- Tell me.

39:33.988 --> 39:35.301
I can't.

39:38.158 --> 39:40.436
I have something
that I have to finish,

39:41.129 --> 39:43.637
and until I do,
I cannot move forward.

39:43.832 --> 39:44.967
The resonator.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.874
Yes, but that's only
the smallest part.

39:48.284 --> 39:51.410
I owe that someone that
I used to love a terrible debt,

39:52.807 --> 39:54.824
and until it's paid in full...

39:57.912 --> 39:58.794
I can't.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.406
Besides...

40:05.651 --> 40:07.187
You love Harker.

40:08.552 --> 40:09.943
No, that's finished.

40:11.187 --> 40:12.630
Never again.

40:13.560 --> 40:14.837
Why?

40:18.483 --> 40:19.879
Why?

40:20.902 --> 40:23.145
Well, he...
he and Lucy...

40:27.444 --> 40:28.445
Lucy?

40:32.149 --> 40:33.811
How could she?

40:39.237 --> 40:41.347
- Mina.
- No, don't. Don't.

40:41.609 --> 40:46.677
Can you please go?
I-I need to be alone right now.

41:42.616 --> 41:43.786
Hello, Lucy.

41:47.021 --> 41:49.549
If you insist
on behaving like a monster,

41:49.674 --> 41:51.724
then I'm going to make you one.
