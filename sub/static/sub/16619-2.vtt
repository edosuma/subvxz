as human shields to prevent our snipers

10:51.888 --> 10:53.055
from having a clean shot.

10:53.089 --> 10:55.024
So at this moment, there is no action.

10:55.058 --> 10:56.135
It's my call, Commissioner.

10:56.159 --> 10:59.495
Wyatt, I need a 20 on Vice
President Haas, please.

10:59.529 --> 11:01.830
Uh, Secret Service shows that
she's on Air Force One.

11:01.865 --> 11:03.666
My superiors at MI6 request access

11:03.693 --> 11:05.343
to any and all actionable intelligence.

11:05.344 --> 11:06.312
You know I can't do that.

11:06.336 --> 11:08.938
The Prime Minister is
inside Federal Hall.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.941
It might be your jurisdiction,
but it's both our problems.

11:11.975 --> 11:15.177
You and I can stand here debating
all day if you want.

11:15.211 --> 11:17.613
Or we can start saving lives.

11:17.647 --> 11:19.815
Director Shaw's right.

11:20.784 --> 11:23.584
Paul Burke, Deputy Chief,
National Security Council.

11:23.585 --> 11:25.486
I just got off the phone
with Vice President Haas,

11:25.510 --> 11:26.949
and the first thing she's requested

11:26.950 --> 11:28.290
before any decisions are made

11:28.314 --> 11:29.802
are eyes on the inside of that building.

11:29.826 --> 11:32.528
Do we have any?

11:34.221 --> 11:35.722
- Okay, come on.
- Okay.

11:35.756 --> 11:37.857
- How much further?
- It depends.

[Panting]

11:41.161 --> 11:42.695
If they find us.

11:43.564 --> 11:45.131
First step of counter-surveillance

11:45.165 --> 11:49.569
is learning to run SDRs...
Surveillance detection routes.

11:49.603 --> 11:51.537
We start with learning
the proper formation

11:51.572 --> 11:54.707
of "the box."

11:54.742 --> 11:57.643
The "rabbit" is the
person being followed.

11:59.446 --> 12:02.515
[Cellphone vibrates]

12:02.549 --> 12:06.419
Stay focused, Dayana! Start again.

12:06.453 --> 12:10.556
The "eyes" are the
ones doing the surveillance.

12:10.591 --> 12:14.494
They make up the
four corners of the box.

12:14.528 --> 12:16.362
The eyes are the visual perimeter.

12:16.397 --> 12:17.659
They never move from their position

12:17.660 --> 12:19.665
unless they need to re-frame
the formation.

12:19.700 --> 12:21.200
Yeah?

12:21.235 --> 12:23.046
Who gets to decide who
re-frames the formation?

12:23.070 --> 12:25.438
Ah, the "trigger."

12:25.472 --> 12:29.208
The trigger always has the
rabbit in their sights

12:29.243 --> 12:31.544
because they're inside
the box with the rabbit,

12:31.578 --> 12:35.448
following the most
closely without getting spotted.

12:35.482 --> 12:37.250
Start again!

12:37.284 --> 12:38.384
When the rabbit moves,

12:38.419 --> 12:40.953
the trigger signals for the
eyes to move with them.

12:40.988 --> 12:42.722
Which means, if you're the rabbit,

12:42.756 --> 12:44.690
you better find your
trigger and your eyes.

12:44.725 --> 12:49.929
If you're the eyes, don't
lose the rabbit or get spotted.

12:49.963 --> 12:51.731
Any and every agent meeting,

12:51.765 --> 12:53.866
dead drop, or intelligence gathering,

12:53.901 --> 12:56.135
you have to assume you're not alone.

12:56.170 --> 12:58.571
Find your path, know
it backwards and forwards.

12:58.605 --> 13:00.206
That's how you survive.

13:00.240 --> 13:03.709
I once ran a live SDR
for 38 straight hours.

13:03.744 --> 13:06.279
And you probably will, too, one day.

13:06.313 --> 13:09.215
This wouldn't be spy
school without a little homework.

13:09.249 --> 13:12.985
Get to know our neighboring
town of Williamsburg.

13:13.020 --> 13:15.121
It's where you'll practice your SDRs.

13:15.155 --> 13:17.423
However, after many years,

13:17.458 --> 13:19.759
the residents have
gotten hip to our training.

13:19.793 --> 13:22.795
So we let them play "Spot the spy."

13:22.830 --> 13:25.131
If they clock you, you
got no business here.

13:25.165 --> 13:26.299
You're out, understood?

13:26.333 --> 13:27.433
All right, get out of here.

13:27.468 --> 13:29.936
We'll run live scenarios tomorrow
and see how you do.

Three years ago in Islamabad,
I was moving through a market

14:05.672 --> 14:07.607
when I realized I had eyes on me.

14:07.641 --> 14:10.543
I got so nervous I kept
my eyes on the ground.

14:10.577 --> 14:13.312
Ended up walking in
circles till the local police

14:13.347 --> 14:15.715
approached me and
started asking questions.

14:15.749 --> 14:17.683
Good thing I had the right answers,

14:17.718 --> 14:19.852
but it never should have got that far.

I should have kept my eyes up.

didn't believe you had potential.

of your class at Harvard Law.

After that, you went
to work at your father's firm,

14:36.370 --> 14:39.405
focusing on the human rights work
they were doing in the DRC.

opened a company bank account.

- Yeah, of course.

If our hunch is correct, in

the reasons you left the FBI
