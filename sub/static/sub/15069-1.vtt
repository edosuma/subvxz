WEBVTT

00:11.094 --> 00:14.306
Defend me, O God, thy humble
servant in all assaults

00:14.431 --> 00:19.019
of the enemy, that I, surely
trusting in thy defense,

00:19.144 --> 00:22.898
may not fear the power
of the adversary,

00:23.023 --> 00:26.443
that the words of my mouth,
the meditation of my heart,

00:26.568 --> 00:29.363
be always acceptable
in thy sight.

00:29.488 --> 00:32.658
O Lord, my strength
and my redeemer.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.886
Hi, Clair.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.022
Excuse me, Reverend.

01:05.147 --> 01:06.692
The news is on.

01:13.282 --> 01:14.950
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.037
Well, the big news of the hour
is, once again,

01:19.162 --> 01:20.956
you guessed it, Fay Grim.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.291
Look, Ned.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.502
It's the lady terrorist,
Fay Grim.

01:25.627 --> 01:26.628
Hey!

01:26.753 --> 01:27.963
Gotta make it look like
you did some work

01:28.088 --> 01:29.423
around here today, Derek.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.967
The suburban single mom
from Woodside Queens convicted

01:32.092 --> 01:35.387
of treason and sentenced to
a lifetime in prison without

01:35.512 --> 01:38.473
hope of parole
is finally being transferred

01:38.599 --> 01:40.934
from a secret U.S. military
detention center

01:41.059 --> 01:42.936
and placed in a
Federal penitentiary

01:43.061 --> 01:44.313
in Upstate New York.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.565
Should've killed that
slut when they found her.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.609
Save the taxpayers
a whole lot of money.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.614
So, Lisa, what's the
feeling there on the ground?

01:53.739 --> 01:56.742
Well, Bob, there's a sizable
crowd of protestors out by

01:56.867 --> 02:00.454
the road chanting for Fay's
execution, but by and large,

02:00.579 --> 02:03.624
the community here
is simply curious.

02:03.749 --> 02:06.251
I say being in prison
her whole life long...

02:06.376 --> 02:08.336
best thing that ever
happened to that girl.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.422
She goes out on the streets,
somebody's bound to hit her

02:10.547 --> 02:11.798
in the head with
a baseball bat or something.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.216
Chet, can you see what
the problem is

02:13.342 --> 02:14.801
with the girl's
lavatory?

02:14.926 --> 02:16.428
Right away, Reverend.
Right away. Just on my way.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.680
You ladies have
a nice day now.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.807
The poor woman.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.435
Mary, pull yourself
together.

02:23.560 --> 02:26.855
She's a traitor to the nation,
an international terrorist.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.190
She's Ned's mother!

02:28.315 --> 02:31.234
Yes, well, of course this wouldn't be
the first time

02:31.360 --> 02:33.779
that a perfectly decent,
God-fearing, sober-minded

02:33.904 --> 02:35.447
person like Ned has risen up

02:35.572 --> 02:37.032
and escaped
from such moral ruin.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.408
I think she's innocent.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.826
She's been convicted, Mary.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.536
Mistakes have
been made before.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.331
Anyway, Ned's been
traumatized by all this.

02:44.456 --> 02:47.459
It's a miracle he's as
well-adjusted as he is.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.961
- Has he decided yet?
- I believe so.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.463
He's 18 today.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.631
He's free to leave
witness protection

02:52.756 --> 02:53.840
if he chooses.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.550
What do you suppose
he's thinking about?

02:55.676 --> 02:57.469
- Me.
- Keep dreaming, Clair.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.262
He smiled and said hello.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.473
You're the minister's daughter
for crying out loud.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.891
He lives in your house.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.102
I bet he's had sex
and everything.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.104
No, he's chaste, I'm certain.

03:07.229 --> 03:09.106
Do you really think he'll
leave, now that he's 18?

03:09.231 --> 03:10.524
I hope not.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.491
But, Mama, why is Ned in
witness protection anyway?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.493
Clair, you know we can't
discuss those things.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.912
This plate is chipped.
See if there's another one.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.498
Not even now, now when
he's about to leave?

03:26.623 --> 03:27.999
Oh, really?
Is he leaving?

03:28.125 --> 03:29.459
That's what everybody says.

03:29.584 --> 03:30.752
What everybody says,
I see.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.045
Well, why don't you
ask him yourself?

03:32.170 --> 03:34.339
Here he comes now.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.842
That was great, Mrs. Gardner.
Thank you.

03:36.967 --> 03:37.968
There's more.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.428
No, thanks.
I'm stuffed.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.804
Derek, what did I tell you?

03:40.929 --> 03:42.431
No mobile devices
at the table.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.099
They let that
lady terrorist go today.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.434
You mean Fay Grim.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.810
They didn't let her go.
They just moved her.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.019
Enough!

03:48.145 --> 03:50.439
Derek, help your sister bring
out the coffee and dessert.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.109
I'm sorry.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.027
At least I know
where she is now.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.821
So you've decided?

03:59.656 --> 04:00.907
Yes.

04:01.032 --> 04:04.703
Are you sure
you want to return to that...

04:04.828 --> 04:06.580
well, that life?

04:09.458 --> 04:10.876
She's my mother.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.797
Happy birthday!

04:15.922 --> 04:17.757
Wow! Thank you.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.676
Clair made it.

04:19.801 --> 04:20.927
Thank you, Clair.

04:21.052 --> 04:23.096
I don't know if
it'll be any good or anything.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.140
- I'm sure it is.
- It's chocolate.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.266
What should I wish for?

04:26.391 --> 04:27.476
No, it's gotta be a secret.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.602
- Does it?
- No.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.312
Clair,
that's just superstitious.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.563
Alice, what do you say?

04:31.688 --> 04:33.648
"The secret things belong
unto the Lord our God."

04:33.774 --> 04:34.983
Clair?

04:35.108 --> 04:36.568
"Ecclesiastes"?

04:36.693 --> 04:38.904
No. "Judges."
Sit down. Go ahead, Ned.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.989
Wish away.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.992
I wish...

04:44.117 --> 04:47.871
I wish this family
the peace, the happiness,

04:47.996 --> 04:52.459
and the security it has
provided me these past 4 years

04:52.584 --> 04:54.002
forever and ever.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.670
Amen.

05:00.509 --> 05:01.635
Dad.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.512
Oh, yes, Ned,

05:03.637 --> 05:06.097
this is just a little something from all
of us.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.432
Don't open it now.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.975
Happy Birthday.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.185
Thank you, all.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.436
It's a Bible.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.813
Derek!

05:35.585 --> 05:39.506
"Our thoughts go with you
and our hopes also."

05:51.977 --> 05:53.562
Wow! Clair!

06:00.193 --> 06:01.486
I wish you wouldn't leave.

06:01.611 --> 06:02.779
I know that.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.447
You're an important
and loved member

06:04.573 --> 06:05.574
of this community.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.576
Besides, there is work here
for you if you want it,

06:07.701 --> 06:09.411
a career,
maybe even the ministry.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.872
I believe you have
a true calling.

06:11.997 --> 06:15.333
I've prayed on it, Reverend.
I'm not sure it's for me.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.254
I know, as you do,

06:19.379 --> 06:23.133
that I've made
mistakes, indiscretions.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.677
That young lady
from Florida, in particular.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.721
We're all human, sir.

06:27.846 --> 06:29.472
Temptation exists.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.309
Yes, but I owe you my life
for your help in covering up

06:32.434 --> 06:34.436
that disgraceful
and tragic episode.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.479
Make your peace
with God, Reverend.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.815
You're too good a man to
be brought low by a mistake

06:38.940 --> 06:40.817
of that kind.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.820
In any event,
your secret is safe with me.

06:49.826 --> 06:51.870
Don't spend it all
in one place.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.455
Thank you, Reverend.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.831
I'll pay this back
in time.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.458
No rush.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.752
You'll retain your new
identity, your new name?

06:58.877 --> 07:00.211
Yes.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.425
What are your intentions?

07:06.968 --> 07:09.346
I'm going to find
my father.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.477
I see. Of course.
And what then?

07:15.602 --> 07:17.520
What will you do when
you find your father?

07:19.606 --> 07:21.608
I'm going to kill him.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.698
I'm going to kill him for
destroying my mom's life,

07:28.823 --> 07:31.952
for leading her astray,
away from the light,

07:32.077 --> 07:35.497
and the power,
and the glory that is God.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.874
I learned it here, sir,
and I thank you

07:37.999 --> 07:39.459
for the knowledge.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.677
I was going to say
"Go in peace."

07:50.637 --> 07:53.974
I'm sorry, Reverend,
but that's not likely.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.870
Hold it, son.
No sudden movement.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.748
Appropriate
physical contact only.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.378
Right?

09:53.593 --> 09:56.930
You're so tall,
and you've got color.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.515
Your hair is darker.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.268
Do you have a girlfriend?

10:02.393 --> 10:03.853
Maybe.
I don't know.

10:03.978 --> 10:07.607
Ha! Playing the field, good,
be careful though, okay?

10:07.732 --> 10:08.900
I'm chaste, Mom.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.318
You're what?

10:10.443 --> 10:13.738
I'm a virgin.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.490
It's what God wants.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.742
We should remain
chaste until marriage.

10:19.536 --> 10:20.537
Mom, it's okay.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.334
You're religious?

10:26.459 --> 10:28.294
There's a better way
to live.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.213
Yeah, well,
tell me about it.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.090
But how are you?

10:32.215 --> 10:34.926
Oh, well...

10:35.051 --> 10:36.344
this place
is a barrel of laughs

10:36.469 --> 10:38.763
compared to where I was.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.808
At least you're allowed to
see people, talk to people.

10:41.933 --> 10:45.103
I do yoga.
I'm starting a book club.

10:45.228 --> 10:46.771
Oh, and a big
publishing company

10:46.896 --> 10:48.940
paid me a million dollars
for my autobiography--

10:49.065 --> 10:51.568
you know, suburban-single-
mom-terrorist sort of thing.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.236
They're sure it'll be
a best-seller.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.654
Are they allowed to do that?

10:54.779 --> 10:57.240
Well, no. I'm not allowed
to earn money myself,

10:57.365 --> 10:58.783
but they've set up
an account for you.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.535
Simon has all the details.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.453
So you're writing
the story of your life?

11:02.579 --> 11:04.747
Not me exactly. No.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.041
They send this graduate
student chick over once a week

11:07.167 --> 11:08.960
who's supposed to be
a genius or something.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.337
She asks me questions
and records it all.

11:11.462 --> 11:12.714
She does all the work.

11:12.839 --> 11:18.428
Mom, forgive me, but you're
not a terrorist, right?

11:18.553 --> 11:19.888
How can you ask me that?

11:20.013 --> 11:23.516
You're just, like, totally falsely
accused, correct?

11:23.641 --> 11:26.019
Yeah, well, of course.

11:27.687 --> 11:31.357
But...

11:31.482 --> 11:34.402
I did some stupid things.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.571
I was confused.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.408
I lied about-- about...

11:42.702 --> 11:46.039
Well, you see, Ned,
there was, you know, a bomb.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.541
Mom, it's okay.
I believe you.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.668
God, I'm such an idiot.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.462
No, you're not.

11:52.587 --> 11:53.713
Oh, what my life
might've been

11:53.838 --> 11:56.216
if I'd never met your father.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.425
I know.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.843
I mean,
apart from having you.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.598
Where is he now?

12:03.723 --> 12:06.226
- Henry?
- Yes.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.603
Russia, I guess.
Odessa, I think.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.606
After that, who knows?
Who cares?

12:11.731 --> 12:14.150
Forget about him, Ned.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.903
He deserves to die for the
trouble he's caused you.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.364
Oh, don't talk like that.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.865
Who deserves to die?

12:20.990 --> 12:23.201
There's a woman here--
Florence. She shot and killed

12:23.326 --> 12:25.036
her husband and
two little girls.

12:25.161 --> 12:28.665
Most days, she wants to die,
but more and more, she's just

12:28.790 --> 12:30.541
this kind, little woman
who's happy to work all day

12:30.667 --> 12:33.461
in the laundry.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.630
What gets into people?

12:35.755 --> 12:37.799
The devil, probably.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.678
Fay, time's up.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.639
Go see your Uncle Simon.
He's got the information

12:44.764 --> 12:46.057
about the publisher
and the money.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.850
- Okay.
- You'll come back soon, right?

12:47.976 --> 12:50.270
As soon as I can, I have to
take care of something first.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.437
Don't forget me in here.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.231
I may have to be
away for a while.

12:53.356 --> 12:54.691
- Okay. Call me.
- I'm sorry, young man.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.150
- Time's up.
- Okay.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.486
Between 7:00 and 9:00
on Wednesday.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.862
I'm always here.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.701
Hi. I'm here to see a friend
of mine. Mr. Simon Grim?

13:46.826 --> 13:48.119
Is he expecting you?

13:48.244 --> 13:49.370
I believe so.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.376
Yes, sir, someone's here.
A Mister...

13:55.501 --> 13:56.878
Edward Rifle.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.504
Mr. Rifle.

13:58.629 --> 13:59.881
Of course.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.216
It's the elevator
to the 4th floor, room 423.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.010
It's the street side.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.893
Ned, nice to see you.
Thanks for visiting.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.395
I'm just revising
my new material.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.730
A new poem?

14:15.855 --> 14:17.273
No, I'm through
with all that.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.693
Working on
my stand-up routine.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.029
- You want to be a comedian?
- Yeah, why not?

14:23.154 --> 14:24.530
Am I not funny?

14:27.950 --> 14:30.161
Well, it's been a while,
Uncle Simon.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.121
That's right.
It's been a while,

14:32.246 --> 14:33.915
and real-life experience
has taught me much,

14:34.040 --> 14:35.708
that perhaps I'd overlooked
as a poet laureate

14:35.833 --> 14:37.960
and cultural touchstone.

14:38.086 --> 14:40.838
People want a good laugh
now and then, Ned, trust me.

14:40.963 --> 14:44.467
Good old-fashioned slapstick
humor, naughty innuendo,

14:44.592 --> 14:45.968
a few well-placed
fart jokes,

14:46.094 --> 14:48.137
enough with the
earnest reflection,

14:48.262 --> 14:49.972
the tragic
but unifying elusiveness

14:50.098 --> 14:51.766
of the human spirit in
modern times and so on.

14:51.891 --> 14:55.603
I'm through with it.

14:55.728 --> 15:00.066
Only now, after all this
heartbreak and controversy,

15:00.191 --> 15:04.320
only now, am I able to
confront my inner clown.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.866
Look, Uncle Simon, my mom said you had
some money for me.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.786
Oh, yeah, here it is.
That's the bank card.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.704
The pin number's on
the Post-It note.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.748
Thanks.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.208
So where exactly
do you do this?

15:17.333 --> 15:20.128
- Do what?
- Your stand-up comedy routine.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.379
Right here in front
of the computer.

15:21.504 --> 15:22.755
I have a weekly video blog.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.298
I'm about to post a new one,

15:24.424 --> 15:27.218
but I can't seem to
get this joke right.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.054
Ah! That's Zach,
my comedy coach.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.639
Excellent.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.015
Think funny.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.767
Hi, Zach.
Come on in.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.144
Zach this is
my nephew, Ned.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.980
- Ned, Zach.
- Think funny.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.523
Hey, you know,
you guys have work to do,

15:40.648 --> 15:42.066
and I have to go
get a room.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.568
I'll leave you to it for now.
Talk to you later, Simon.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.027
See you later, kid.

15:46.571 --> 15:47.989
Have you got a room free?

15:48.114 --> 15:49.365
How many nights?

15:49.490 --> 15:51.909
Two, three, maybe.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.662
Yeah, I can do that.
A single, right?

15:54.787 --> 15:57.123
Right. Can I leave
my suitcase here?

15:57.248 --> 15:58.666
Sure.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.863
Wow, that's a lot of money.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.673
Hey.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.218
Hey.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.721
Are you staying
at the hotel?

16:53.846 --> 16:57.683
Oh, I just sort of
hang around there.

16:57.808 --> 17:03.898
Oh, well, I'm sorry but,
I'm not interested.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.566
In what?

17:05.691 --> 17:10.279
In whatever it is
you're selling.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.740
Do you think
I'm a prostitute?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.124
What do you want?

17:22.250 --> 17:23.876
To meet Simon Grim.

17:24.001 --> 17:27.088
Oh, that's why you
hang around the hotel?

17:27.213 --> 17:28.756
He never leaves
the building.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.508
I've been here for weeks.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.636
I did my graduate
thesis on his poetry.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.023
Susan.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.109
Edward.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.745
He claims he's over poetry now and wants
to do

17:59.870 --> 18:01.372
stand-up comedy.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.207
Of course. All the poets
are doing that now.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.751
It's the new thing.
Have you seen his blog?

18:05.876 --> 18:06.961
- Not yet.
- Don't.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.963
It's bad, huh?

18:09.088 --> 18:11.382
It's perfectly harmless,
mind-numbingly attuned to

18:11.507 --> 18:14.010
the lowest common denominator
of consumer entertainment.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.469
What do you want to talk
to him about then?

18:15.595 --> 18:16.846
Are you familiar
with his work?

18:16.971 --> 18:18.806
- Grim's?
- Yes.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.391
A little, I, uh,

18:20.516 --> 18:22.810
sometimes work for
his comedy coach, Zach.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.604
He's a jerk.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.397
Zach?

18:26.522 --> 18:27.898
I asked him
to introduce me to Grim,

18:28.024 --> 18:29.984
and he insisted on
sexual favors.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.360
No!

18:31.485 --> 18:33.487
And afterwards, he still
refused to introduce me.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.993
You're not well.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.495
I got caught in
the rain yesterday.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.998
Where do you stay?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.125
Oh, around.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.003
Do you have a room
for my friend here?

18:49.128 --> 18:50.296
She's your friend?

18:50.421 --> 18:51.422
Yes, I'm paying.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.798
He thinks I'm a prostitute, too.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.634
No, you're the poet
laureate stalker.

18:54.759 --> 18:55.885
Ex-poet laureate.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.471
She wrote a book about him.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.222
I have no singles left.

19:00.348 --> 19:01.849
This place doesn't
seem so busy.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.476
Still, no singles.
You got the last one.

19:03.601 --> 19:06.312
I do have a double, though.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.522
Does that mean two beds?

19:08.648 --> 19:10.816
Two single beds.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.903
That okay with you?

19:44.600 --> 19:46.519
Where's that comedy coach
of yours?

19:46.644 --> 19:49.146
- I fired him.
- Yeah?

19:49.271 --> 19:51.899
I don't think Zach knows the first thing
about being funny.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.485
And you do?

19:54.610 --> 19:58.072
You appear to doubt
my comic chops.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.449
Simon, what are you doing?

20:00.574 --> 20:03.452
I want to be popular and
liked, like everybody else.

20:03.577 --> 20:04.912
But you're not popular,

20:05.037 --> 20:06.914
and it takes most people a while to get
to know you

20:07.039 --> 20:09.500
before they like you,
and once they like you,

20:09.625 --> 20:10.918
they tend to love you.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.545
Yeah, but I can change that.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.506
- Why?
- Have you read my poetry?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.925
Yeah, well, no,
not really.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.760
But I'm not that into poetry.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.679
But that's just it.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.597
Shouldn't I be doing something that a
hip, young guy

20:23.723 --> 20:25.141
like yourself is interested in?

20:25.266 --> 20:26.934
Am I hip?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.103
Well, I don't know.
Aren't you? You're young.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.897
Simon, if you're all set
on chucking poetry,

20:32.022 --> 20:35.109
don't waste your time trying
to be a stand-up comic.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.528
Set you eyes on the
straight and narrow,

20:37.653 --> 20:40.030
and give yourself to Jesus.

20:41.198 --> 20:42.992
You're not just trying to
be funny now, are you?

20:43.117 --> 20:45.327
No, of course not.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.538
Well, this is new.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.707
You've found God?

20:49.832 --> 20:54.628
Look, I have a friend downstairs who
wants to meet you.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.714
- Is this an intervention?
- A what?

20:56.839 --> 20:58.340
Am I gonna be baptized
or something?

20:58.466 --> 21:00.134
No.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.303
She knows all
about your poetry.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.930
She wants to give you
a copy of her dissertation.

21:05.055 --> 21:09.143
It's the least you can do,
I think, really.

21:09.268 --> 21:12.313
Okay.
Bring her up.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.732
Tomorrow.
She's sleeping.

21:14.857 --> 21:19.320
Now, any ideas about where
my father might be?

21:20.446 --> 21:21.739
Seattle.

21:21.864 --> 21:24.617
Hundreds of people follow my
blog, and many of them write

21:24.742 --> 21:26.202
in and post comments.

21:26.327 --> 21:29.747
Henry, who seems to work at,
or used to work at a certain

21:29.872 --> 21:31.582
bookstore in Seattle,

21:31.707 --> 21:34.001
writes in weekly,
and assassinates my character

21:34.126 --> 21:36.670
in increasingly
elaborate ways.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.799
I think more people
follow my blog to read him

21:39.924 --> 21:41.926
than to see my stand-up routine,
honestly.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.853
You're not going to try and
save Henry for Jesus, are you?

21:53.938 --> 21:55.773
And what if I am?

22:19.964 --> 22:22.550
O Lord, give unto thy
servant that peace that the

22:22.675 --> 22:25.636
world cannot give, that my
heart may be set to obey

22:25.761 --> 22:27.346
thy commandments,

22:27.471 --> 22:29.473
That through thee I
remain constant of purpose

22:29.598 --> 22:31.141
and fearless of the enemy.

22:31.267 --> 22:34.728
Lighten my darkness, O Lord,
I beseech thee, and by thy

22:34.854 --> 22:37.273
mercy defend me from the
perils and dangers of this

22:37.398 --> 22:40.234
night, for the love of
thy Holy Son, our Savior,

22:40.359 --> 22:41.819
Jesus Christ.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.195
Amen.

22:52.621 --> 22:55.082
He said 10:00?

22:55.207 --> 22:56.876
Any time after 10:00.

22:57.001 --> 22:59.461
How do I look?

22:59.587 --> 23:01.505
Great. What are you
all dolled-up for?

23:01.630 --> 23:04.383
You're just going to be talking about
poetry and literature.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.801
I don't look like a slut, do I?

23:05.926 --> 23:07.636
- No.
- Really?

23:07.761 --> 23:13.267
Yeah, it's just...
I don't-- well...

23:13.392 --> 23:16.103
I don't know anything
about literature.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.646
That's right, you don't.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.692
See you this afternoon.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.527
Good luck.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.743
She went up to the poet
laureate 10 minutes ago.

23:30.868 --> 23:32.119
We're okay with
the room, right?

23:32.244 --> 23:34.496
- Two more nights.
- Okay, thanks.

23:34.622 --> 23:35.915
Want me to tell her anything?

23:36.040 --> 23:39.043
No. Make sure she
knows the room's hers.

23:40.669 --> 23:42.546
- La Guardia Airport.
- Okay.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.508
I've always read the poems,

23:46.634 --> 23:48.761
even and especially,
the later ones,

23:48.886 --> 23:53.015
as an evocation of the joys
and sorrows of influence.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.893
The evolution of one's
own manner of perceiving

23:56.018 --> 23:58.312
and inevitably expressing
the world to one's self

23:58.437 --> 23:59.730
and to others

23:59.855 --> 24:03.859
the sadness of breaking with
the cherished attitudes

24:03.984 --> 24:06.153
inherited from the friendly,

24:06.278 --> 24:09.323
encouraging,
but ultimately limited sources

24:09.448 --> 24:11.951
that must be outgrown.

24:12.076 --> 24:13.410
Please go on.

24:13.535 --> 24:20.334
I recognize that voice--
the tempter, the challenger,

24:20.459 --> 24:23.337
the seducer, the friend.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.672
Yes.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.632
I use the term "antagonist"
to start with,

24:26.757 --> 24:29.343
but it's
more fluid than that.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.970
I could never find
the right word

24:31.095 --> 24:32.346
for how he feels to be with.

24:32.471 --> 24:37.643
It's actually more like
being inspired by the wind,

24:37.768 --> 24:40.771
the rain, a sickness,

24:40.896 --> 24:45.359
some other uncontrollable element--
demonic.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.611
You seem to know Henry
better than I do.

24:47.736 --> 24:49.905
It's expressed better in
the body of the text itself,

24:50.030 --> 24:52.741
but that is, I think,
it generally.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.378
It was difficult to get out
from the shadow he cast.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.714
There was always something apt
about his most unreasonable

25:06.839 --> 25:08.757
ranting and raving that
kept me from dismissing his

25:08.882 --> 25:10.718
input entirely--

25:10.843 --> 25:14.304
his own failures, his own
ineptitude, his delusions.

25:14.430 --> 25:16.974
These, I came to see,
were my lens onto the world.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.309
It provided a material out
of which to shape an image

25:19.435 --> 25:21.603
of that world
as I endured it.

25:21.729 --> 25:22.938
Endured it?

25:23.063 --> 25:24.815
I merely endured the world
until my friend, Henry,

25:24.940 --> 25:26.650
showed me
one could do otherwise.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.318
It was the same with me.

25:28.444 --> 25:29.695
Excuse me?

25:29.820 --> 25:31.822
I mean, of course,
through the reading

25:31.947 --> 25:34.408
of your poetry,
how you rendered him

25:34.533 --> 25:35.701
and his influence upon you.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.665
I'm moved by how intimately
you've engaged in my poetry.

25:41.790 --> 25:45.252
It means the world to me,
and I was so afraid

25:45.377 --> 25:46.670
I might be totally mistaken.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.297
What do you want?
A documentary?

25:48.422 --> 25:49.882
A YouTube feed?
A series of Tweets?

25:50.007 --> 25:51.341
Whatever you want,
just ask.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.135
Stop doing your blog.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.928
Oh.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.680
The stand-up thing
is awful.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.057
Wow.

25:58.182 --> 26:02.269
Decisive, committed,
admittedly obscure work

26:02.394 --> 26:04.772
indifferent to mainstream
approval and unafraid

26:04.897 --> 26:07.274
of confrontation with moral
and aesthetic absolutes.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.735
This, more than you might
imagine, is what keeps people

26:09.860 --> 26:12.613
from jumping out
windows and under trains.

26:12.738 --> 26:15.866
Adding to mass-cultural
self-congratulation is,

26:15.991 --> 26:18.035
of course, its own reward--
cheap, immediate,

26:18.160 --> 26:20.079
and disposable, as it is.

26:22.790 --> 26:23.999
Sorry.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.711
So you think it's okay
for me to be unpopular?

26:27.836 --> 26:30.297
Oh, I think it's necessary.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.882
You're an unusual person.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.383
I have few friends.

26:35.511 --> 26:38.097
I hope I haven't
hurt your feelings.

26:38.222 --> 26:41.308
No.
Thank you.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.727
I hope we can talk again soon,

26:43.852 --> 26:46.730
but I have to ask,
are you religious, as well?

26:46.855 --> 26:47.940
As well?

26:48.065 --> 26:49.900
As Ned, my nephew,
who introduced us.

26:50.025 --> 26:54.321
- You mean Edward?
- We call him Ned.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.697
Young Mr. Rifle?

26:55.823 --> 26:57.366
That's my mother's
maiden name.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.284
He was advised to
remain incognito.

26:59.409 --> 27:02.496
- The son of Fay Grim?
- And Henry Fool.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.791
- You're leaving?
- Oh, I just...

27:05.916 --> 27:07.793
forgot I have to do something.

27:07.918 --> 27:09.378
And no, I'm not religious.

27:09.503 --> 27:11.547
Sorry. Thank you so much.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.259
- Come back soon.
- I will.

27:15.384 --> 27:17.136
Where's my friend
Mr. Rifle?

27:17.261 --> 27:18.929
Your room is paid for
for the next two nights.

27:19.054 --> 27:20.180
Where has he gone?

27:20.305 --> 27:23.350
- I saw him hail a cab.
- And?

27:23.475 --> 27:25.811
He might've said something
about La Guardia Airport.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.491
Thank you.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.749
What are you doing here?

27:47.875 --> 27:49.918
My meeting with
Simon Grim was amazing.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.546
Thank you so much
for setting it up.

27:52.671 --> 27:53.964
Sure, sure,
but you didn't have to come

27:54.089 --> 27:55.174
all the way out here
to thank me.

27:55.299 --> 27:56.967
I mean, the room's paid up
for a couple of nights.

27:57.092 --> 28:00.387
- I know, but I like you.
- Oh, man.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.097
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- Stop.

28:02.222 --> 28:05.559
I know I'm a little older
than you, but I'm fun,

28:05.684 --> 28:07.978
and I know a bunch
of different languages,

28:08.103 --> 28:10.522
and I don't do drugs, and--

28:14.109 --> 28:15.569
Why Seattle?

28:15.694 --> 28:17.988
I have some business to
do there for Simon Grim.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.573
You don't work
for Zach anymore?

28:19.698 --> 28:20.949
No.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.503
Dad?

28:43.430 --> 28:46.600
Toothpaste, soap, shampoo.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.019
Look at these towels.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.021
You look fine.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.189
Really?

28:52.314 --> 28:54.024
You have no clothes
but what you're wearing?

28:54.149 --> 28:56.818
No, but I can get
these laundered here.

28:56.944 --> 28:59.613
Is that okay?

28:59.738 --> 29:01.615
Go buy yourself some things.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.242
I have to go meet someone.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.577
Tomorrow, you can take
me to the bookstore.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.037
How long will you be?

29:07.162 --> 29:08.997
Hard to tell.
Don't wait up.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.699
- Fay.
- So, listen, wise guy,

30:25.824 --> 30:27.117
like I was saying last week--

30:27.242 --> 30:28.327
- Fay, hold on.
- What?

30:28.452 --> 30:29.745
Did Ned come
to see you yet?

30:29.870 --> 30:32.289
- Yeah, he did.
- Hasn't he gotten tall?

30:32.414 --> 30:34.708
He's, like, you know,
a man and everything.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.294
- And he's Christian.
- Yeah, right?

30:37.419 --> 30:38.670
Where does he get
that from, I wonder?

30:38.795 --> 30:40.047
Apparently, he's lived with
a devout family

30:40.172 --> 30:41.423
these past four years.

30:41.548 --> 30:42.799
You see, Simon,
that's what I mean.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.885
He's so damn
impressionable, that kid.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.721
But anyway, I think it's
you he gets that from.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.349
Me? I haven't been inside a church since
you married Henry.

30:50.474 --> 30:51.725
Yeah, well, it's how, like,

30:51.850 --> 30:54.144
people discuss you
and everything, you're this--

30:54.269 --> 30:56.563
this weird kind of
moral compass in a society

30:56.688 --> 30:58.398
half-convinced of its
own worthlessness.

31:00.650 --> 31:01.818
You don't sound
like yourself.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.403
Who have you been
talking to?

31:03.528 --> 31:05.405
Oh, this graduate student
the publisher hired

31:05.530 --> 31:07.574
to write my autobiography
was here the other week.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.534
She's got a truckload of ways
to say how you've influenced

31:09.659 --> 31:11.161
the zeitgeist and
everything, Simon.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.164
Really, I was impressed,
but then I told her how

31:14.289 --> 31:16.041
I always had to get you out
of fights in high school and--

31:16.166 --> 31:18.752
Fay, listen, I need to talk to you about
something important.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.505
Oh, and, like, my autobiography
is not important?

31:21.630 --> 31:24.966
No, of course it is, but, Fay,
did Henry ever tell you about

31:25.092 --> 31:27.761
the girl he went to prison for having
sexual relations with?

31:27.886 --> 31:29.971
You mean, the 13-year-old
girl he sexually molested?

31:30.097 --> 31:32.432
- Well, okay, yes.
- No.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.976
- Her name was Susan.
- Do I really have to hear this?

31:35.102 --> 31:38.897
Yes, because I believe I met
this girl, Susan, yesterday.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.273
What?

31:40.399 --> 31:41.858
I mean, she's a woman,
now, of course.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.444
She's written this remarkable
study of my work, or least,

31:44.569 --> 31:46.655
that aspect of my work which
she feels, and I must admit,

31:46.780 --> 31:48.657
she's onto something here,
that aspect of my poetry that

31:48.782 --> 31:50.367
centers on my
friendship with Henry.

31:50.492 --> 31:51.785
- That's odd.
- Not really.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.204
Unusual, yes,
but an original and provocative

31:54.329 --> 31:55.455
reading of these poems and--

31:55.580 --> 31:57.457
No, I mean...
I mean,

31:57.582 --> 32:01.211
this graduate student who's writing the
story of my life.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.630
Her name is Susan, too.

32:03.755 --> 32:04.756
What does she look like?

32:04.881 --> 32:07.300
Early 30s, skinny,
addicted to lipstick.

32:08.343 --> 32:11.847
And the lipstick is not on,
you know, correctly.

32:11.972 --> 32:14.641
Exactly.
She's kind of helpless.

32:14.766 --> 32:17.018
- Where did you meet her?
- Well, that's the thing.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.437
She was introduced
to me by Ned.

32:18.562 --> 32:20.897
- Uh-oh.
- My feelings exactly.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.399
Are you sure it's her?

32:22.524 --> 32:24.568
Fay, she sat here and talked
about my poems in a way that

32:24.693 --> 32:27.821
only a person could if
they knew Henry intimately.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.114
You said she was with Ned?

32:29.239 --> 32:30.866
He introduced her to me.

32:30.991 --> 32:32.868
And, were they,
like, together?

32:32.993 --> 32:34.411
I think so.

32:34.536 --> 32:35.871
You know
he's chaste, right?

32:35.996 --> 32:37.038
Chaste?

32:37.164 --> 32:38.832
Yeah, it means,
you know, that, like--

32:38.957 --> 32:40.292
I know what chaste means, Fay.

32:40.417 --> 32:43.044
Well, what do you
think she's up to?

32:43.170 --> 32:45.088
It's hard to say.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.882
I hope she's not a
psycho killer or anything.

32:47.007 --> 32:48.925
I was really enjoying
our time together.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.553
I'll talk to your publisher
and see what I can find out.

33:01.563 --> 33:04.900
I'll be over in Erotica
if you need me.

33:05.025 --> 33:06.276
Whatever.

33:09.029 --> 33:10.489
Yeah?

33:10.614 --> 33:12.908
Looking for a friend of mine
who I think used to work here.

33:13.033 --> 33:14.910
An older guy named Henry.

33:15.035 --> 33:17.120
- Henry?
- Loudmouth.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.288
- Troublemaker?
- Drunkard.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.706
- Thief.
- Egomaniac.

33:19.831 --> 33:20.999
- Sex fiend?
- That's him.

33:21.124 --> 33:22.292
We fired him.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.835
He's not allowed in
the store anymore.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.879
- But he's around?
- As far as I know.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.881
He's always at the topless bar down the
block

33:28.006 --> 33:29.549
with his pal, Bud,

33:29.674 --> 33:33.303
who's also not allowed
in here anymore.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.679
You gonna buy that?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.894
This is it, I guess.
Wait here.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.812
There's no way
you're 21, buddy.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.440
Oh, wait, I just need to go
in and find somebody.

33:45.565 --> 33:46.816
No matter, man.
I can't let you in.

33:46.942 --> 33:48.944
I'll go.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.989
- What's his name?
- But she can go in?

33:53.114 --> 33:54.741
Dude, it's a
gentleman's club, okay?

33:54.866 --> 33:56.493
Smokin' babes are
always welcome.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.912
- I used to dance here.
- No, when?

33:59.037 --> 34:00.622
You were just a child.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.750
- Talk dirty to me.
- What's his name?

34:03.875 --> 34:05.335
- Bud.
- Bud?

34:05.460 --> 34:06.753
You're looking for Bud?

34:06.878 --> 34:08.295
Right at the bar.

34:22.060 --> 34:26.063
- Bud?
- I can't. Not now.

34:26.188 --> 34:27.190
I'm working.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.695
Dude, it's nothing personal.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.114
- What?
- It's just the law.

34:35.489 --> 34:37.993
There's a law
higher than the law.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.369
Really?

34:39.494 --> 34:40.954
You think I'd ever want to go into a
place like this

34:41.079 --> 34:42.330
if I didn't have to?

34:42.455 --> 34:46.167
I see. I was mistaken.
Sorry, man.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.420
Ned, this is Bud.

34:48.545 --> 34:50.505
Bud, this is Ned.

34:52.716 --> 34:54.967
You wanna talk to me?

34:55.092 --> 34:57.971
- Yeah.
- About what?

34:58.096 --> 34:59.097
Henry.

35:01.308 --> 35:03.393
Buy me lunch.

35:03.518 --> 35:04.519
No problem.

35:04.644 --> 35:07.856
And, like, I'm gonna
need some booze.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.532
I send him his reading
material, books I steal from

35:17.657 --> 35:18.908
the library over here.

35:19.034 --> 35:20.869
Where? Where do you send
the reading material?

35:20.994 --> 35:22.996
He took this job as a,
I don't know,

35:23.121 --> 35:24.831
test case
for some drug company

35:24.956 --> 35:27.250
or something down
outside of Portland, Oregon.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.127
Do you have the address,
the name of the place?

35:29.252 --> 35:32.380
Ashbrook Pharmaceuticals.
Hey, you ain't, like--

35:32.505 --> 35:33.757
he don't owe you money
or nothing, right?

35:33.882 --> 35:35.133
No.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.760
He didn't impregnate
your sister or nothing?

35:36.885 --> 35:38.386
I'm a friend.

35:38.511 --> 35:39.763
'Cause he's my teacher and shit.

35:39.888 --> 35:41.014
I gotta watch his back.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.474
Yeah?
What did he teach you?

35:42.599 --> 35:43.975
He taught me to write.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.685
- Poetry, I guess.
- Damn straight.

35:45.810 --> 35:49.314
I was just a garbage man
before Henry came to town.

35:49.439 --> 35:50.857
Listen, thanks
for talking to me.

35:50.982 --> 35:54.444
- I have to go.
- What about my booze?

35:54.569 --> 35:56.112
My friend will be here
with it any minute now.

35:56.237 --> 35:57.739
She your girl?

35:57.864 --> 35:59.115
No.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.867
Because I think
she sorta digs me.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.410
Yeah, I think so, too.
So, just wait here.

36:02.535 --> 36:04.412
And listen, don't tell her what
we talked about, okay?

36:04.537 --> 36:06.081
- Done.
- Or where I'm headed.

36:06.206 --> 36:07.374
Double done.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.474
- Mr. Grim.
- Yes, hello. Simon.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.059
Such an unexpected
pleasure, really.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.894
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.480
Not at all, please,
come on in.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.485
- Simon Grim.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.278
- I thought he was dead.
- I know.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.161
Wow, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

36:45.286 --> 36:46.538
Where's Ned?

36:46.663 --> 36:48.498
Ned? Ned who?
Who's Ned?

36:48.623 --> 36:50.500
Come on, Bud.
We're friends, right?

36:50.625 --> 36:52.794
Oh, yes; I've been writing
a poem about you even.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.295
So you have to tell
me where Ned's gone.

36:54.421 --> 36:55.505
But this poem, you see,

36:55.630 --> 36:58.091
requires a certain
creatural detail.

36:58.216 --> 37:01.136
The currency of lived
experience, so to speak.

37:01.261 --> 37:03.513
What's it about,
this poem?

37:03.638 --> 37:04.973
Your thigh.

37:05.098 --> 37:07.183
Which one?

37:07.308 --> 37:09.686
Wow, now there's an idea.

37:09.811 --> 37:11.521
Bud, concentrate.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.526
This one.

37:16.651 --> 37:18.486
- You want to touch it?
- I have to.

37:18.611 --> 37:19.863
How long?

37:19.988 --> 37:21.948
60 seconds is the
structural prerequisite

37:22.073 --> 37:24.951
of my poetic expression.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.953
A formalist.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.122
Interesting.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.540
But where has Ned gone?

37:30.665 --> 37:34.127
Ashbrook Pharmaceuticals,
Portland, Oregon.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.254
Okay, let's do it.

37:44.304 --> 37:45.847
I'm interested in the young
woman you've hired to

37:45.972 --> 37:47.974
ghost-write my sister's
autobiography.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.726
- Susan.
- It's come to my attention

37:49.851 --> 37:52.437
she's written a quite thorough analysis
of my own work.

37:52.562 --> 37:53.897
Ah, yes.

37:54.022 --> 37:56.941
Well, so you know
about this then?

37:57.066 --> 37:58.276
I was impressed.

37:58.401 --> 37:59.986
Really, you've read it?

38:00.111 --> 38:03.156
Yes, I'd like to
know more about her.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.158
She'd been writing movie
reviews for a small,

38:05.283 --> 38:06.993
city-wide entertainment guide.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.579
She developed quite a
following because, well,

38:09.704 --> 38:11.372
because no matter what
she was reviewing,

38:11.498 --> 38:13.792
it always came around
to a discussion of your poetry.

38:13.917 --> 38:15.168
I see.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.836
It's quite hilariously
obsessive.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.213
But well-written?

38:18.338 --> 38:19.672
One couldn't fault the grammar,

38:19.798 --> 38:21.800
but the irony was a bit too intense for
me.

38:21.925 --> 38:23.843
Nevertheless, she became
popularly associated

38:23.968 --> 38:26.429
with you and Fay,
the infamous Grims.

38:26.554 --> 38:28.431
So when I had this idea
for the Fay autobiography,

38:28.556 --> 38:29.682
I thought, of course.

38:29.808 --> 38:33.394
Get this well-read,
fringe iconoclast to ghost it.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.855
That turned out to be more
difficult than I anticipated.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.566
Why?

38:38.691 --> 38:41.027
Because she was,
as I should've expected,

38:41.152 --> 38:43.071
in a mental hospital.

38:43.196 --> 38:44.614
Ah.

38:44.739 --> 38:48.910
Olive, tell Simon
here about Susan.

38:49.035 --> 38:51.621
She, um,
presented her dissertation

38:51.746 --> 38:53.623
at Columbia University and--

38:53.748 --> 38:55.041
Go ahead.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.210
Well, Mr. Grim,
it was, of course,

38:57.335 --> 38:58.878
a dissertation on your poetry.

38:59.003 --> 39:00.547
I understand.

39:02.632 --> 39:06.052
They refused outright to grant
her diploma, and apparently,

39:06.177 --> 39:07.846
she had a nervous breakdown

39:07.971 --> 39:10.557
and stabbed
her academic advisor.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.642
So, she's violent.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.519
Turns out, she's been in and out
of psychiatric care

39:14.644 --> 39:16.062
since she was 13.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.731
The charges
were eventually dropped.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.442
She's a loaded pistol,
Simon, and I like that.

39:21.568 --> 39:23.111
Comes across in her prose.

39:23.236 --> 39:26.531
Biting, precise,
and, well, yes, obsessive.

39:26.656 --> 39:27.657
When will you see her next?

39:27.782 --> 39:29.075
Us? Oh, we never see her.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.661
She transcribes her interviews
with Fay each week,

39:31.786 --> 39:33.746
reworks them into chapters,
and emails them to me.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.415
We're about a third
of the way through the book.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.667
- It's incendiary.
- It'll be huge.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.252
We're negotiating
with the penitentiary

39:39.377 --> 39:40.879
to get a photo shoot done
with Fay.

39:41.004 --> 39:43.256
"Esquire's" on board,
maybe "GQ," "Vanity Fair."

39:43.381 --> 39:45.592
And the controversy is more
than likely to generate

39:45.717 --> 39:48.011
a renewed interest in
even your work, Mr. Grim.

39:48.136 --> 39:49.262
Good thinking, Olive.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.347
Simon, who are you with
these days?

39:51.472 --> 39:52.473
Anyone?

39:59.397 --> 40:00.982
Fay, you have a visitor.

40:23.421 --> 40:26.299
Please have a seat.

40:32.764 --> 40:36.309
My name is Daniel.
Reverend Gardner.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.145
Ned may have
mentioned me to you.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.314
Yes.

40:41.439 --> 40:45.526
If I may say so, Fay,
Ned is like a son to me.

40:45.652 --> 40:48.154
Me too.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.741
Fay, I believe Ned intends
to do something terrible.

40:51.866 --> 40:54.327
Oh, man.

40:54.452 --> 40:55.870
He loves you very much.

40:55.995 --> 40:57.997
Of course he does.

40:59.499 --> 41:01.751
What do you mean by that?

41:01.876 --> 41:04.337
It means he'll kill the man
he thinks is responsible

41:04.462 --> 41:06.255
for your incarceration.

41:10.677 --> 41:12.011
Henry?

41:12.136 --> 41:13.346
Fool.

41:13.471 --> 41:18.601
- With an "E"?
- Could be.

41:18.726 --> 41:21.145
The man you describe
is here.

41:21.270 --> 41:23.773
Can I see him?

41:23.898 --> 41:25.900
- You say he's your father.
- Yes.

41:27.026 --> 41:29.362
He's been here for a
little over a year.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.739
He replied to an ad we
placed asking for volunteers

41:31.864 --> 41:34.826
on the testing of certain
drugs we were developing.

41:34.951 --> 41:37.328
However, we were advised to
cease experimenting with these

41:37.453 --> 41:38.788
particular medications,

41:38.913 --> 41:40.373
but by then, unfortunately,

41:40.498 --> 41:42.250
Henry had begun to exhibit
side effects.

41:42.375 --> 41:43.543
Like what?

41:43.668 --> 41:48.631
Well, there are certain
physio-optical manifestations.

41:48.756 --> 41:50.883
- He sees things?
- Yes,

41:51.009 --> 41:52.802
which, of course,
is not entirely unusual

41:52.927 --> 41:55.972
under the circumstances
of the experiment, but...

41:56.097 --> 41:57.849
Well, anyway, he has no legal right to
compensation

41:57.974 --> 42:00.226
in that regard.

42:00.351 --> 42:03.730
However, there is the issue
of his delusions, typically

42:03.855 --> 42:07.650
a symptom of mental disorder,
which, honestly, we should've

42:07.775 --> 42:09.736
done due diligence in
detecting before we agreed to

42:09.861 --> 42:11.320
have him participate.

42:11.446 --> 42:14.240
This, you see,
could expose the laboratory

42:14.365 --> 42:15.825
to legal action.

42:15.950 --> 42:17.869
And what's his delusion?

42:17.994 --> 42:21.247
He believes, apparently
with perfect sincerity,

42:21.372 --> 42:24.417
that he is...

42:24.542 --> 42:27.253
well, the devil.

42:27.378 --> 42:29.839
- Are you okay?
- It's all right.

42:36.012 --> 42:37.263
Yes, sir.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.848
Have you seen
that young woman around,

42:38.973 --> 42:39.974
the young lady who hangs out down here?

42:40.099 --> 42:41.684
That would be
your stalker, Mr. Grim.

42:41.809 --> 42:44.103
Well, yeah, I guess so.
Susan.

42:44.228 --> 42:47.273
She left yesterday,
following the young man.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.859
- Young man?
- Mr. Rifle.

42:49.984 --> 42:51.986
- Where?
- Uh, to the airport.

42:52.111 --> 42:54.947
In fact, Mr. Grim,
you have another visitor.

42:57.992 --> 43:01.037
As delusions go,
it's a remarkable narrative.

43:01.162 --> 43:02.455
To be perfectly accurate,

43:02.580 --> 43:06.876
he claims he's the devil's number-one
assistant, or was.

43:07.001 --> 43:10.088
He was born into the human realm in 1591
to run riot--

43:10.213 --> 43:11.464
Can you throw him out?

43:11.589 --> 43:12.882
No, our lawyers have indicated
that would cast

43:13.007 --> 43:15.093
a bad light on our situation.

43:15.218 --> 43:16.469
Let me talk to him.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.472
I'll convince him
to leave on his own.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.432
You don't look so good
all of a sudden.

43:24.435 --> 43:25.686
Oh, man.

43:27.897 --> 43:30.358
Is this a problem?

43:33.444 --> 43:35.530
I'll be with you
in a minute.

43:40.451 --> 43:42.161
What are you doing here?

43:42.286 --> 43:44.288
I'm supposed to help you.

43:46.624 --> 43:48.626
I didn't ask you to.

44:00.054 --> 44:01.139
I'm sorry.

44:01.264 --> 44:04.517
You don't look good.
What's wrong?

44:04.642 --> 44:06.060
I was up all night driving.

44:06.185 --> 44:07.812
I haven't slept.

44:07.937 --> 44:09.981
What happened to your hand?

44:10.106 --> 44:13.734
Look, my father's
a patient in here.

44:13.860 --> 44:16.821
I haven't seen him since
I was a little kid.

44:20.158 --> 44:24.620
Okay, I'll stay here.
Do what you have to do.

44:24.745 --> 44:26.455
I'm okay right here.

44:26.581 --> 44:29.500
Mr. Rifle, they're ready for us.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.277
Don't be taken in.

44:56.402 --> 44:57.653
He's a great tragic actor.

44:57.778 --> 44:59.280
The drama never stops.

44:59.405 --> 45:00.573
Just wait here.

45:02.325 --> 45:04.076
Auf wiedersehen,
mademoiselles.

45:04.202 --> 45:05.661
Dr. Ford.
Is it Thursday already?

45:05.786 --> 45:07.371
Henry, who were those women?

45:07.496 --> 45:09.457
Local pilgrims
seeking wisdom.

45:09.582 --> 45:11.000
Whoa, hold on.

45:11.125 --> 45:12.752
You dismantled the alarm
on the fire door again.

45:12.877 --> 45:14.295
Look, I have to smoke someplace.

45:15.546 --> 45:16.964
I know where you live, asshole.

45:17.089 --> 45:19.300
Who's the winsome tart with the
humorless youth over there?

45:19.425 --> 45:20.760
Henry, please.

45:20.885 --> 45:22.011
Doctor, I can't work
under these conditions.

45:22.136 --> 45:23.429
My point exactly.

45:23.554 --> 45:25.598
Why do you insist on
remaining here?

45:30.728 --> 45:32.271
Thank you
for this information, Reverend.

45:32.396 --> 45:33.689
Of course.

45:33.814 --> 45:35.441
Hopefully, we can reach
him before he does

45:35.566 --> 45:36.734
anything irreparable.

45:41.155 --> 45:42.740
It's him.

45:42.865 --> 45:44.283
You sure?

45:44.408 --> 45:47.245
- Yes.
- And you'll talk to him?

45:47.370 --> 45:49.413
I'll come back tomorrow.

45:49.538 --> 45:52.083
I'll only tell him
to expect a visitor.

45:52.208 --> 45:54.377
I'll leave the rest to you.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.185
Come on.

46:11.310 --> 46:13.312
They gave me the name of
a motel down the road.

46:27.910 --> 46:30.663
I'm sorry, we actually only have one
single room available.

46:30.788 --> 46:33.249
Okay, a double is okay.

46:33.374 --> 46:35.668
Yeah, we don't have
any doubles either.

46:35.793 --> 46:38.254
In fact, we just have
the one room, a single.

46:59.984 --> 47:01.819
Come, get some sleep.

47:01.944 --> 47:04.447
No, I have to--
I have to go.

47:09.243 --> 47:11.245
You have to go pray?

47:12.830 --> 47:15.708
Yeah.

47:15.833 --> 47:19.712
You'll have to tell
me about that one day.

47:19.837 --> 47:23.716
What's to tell?

47:23.841 --> 47:26.469
How it feels to have
someone listening.

47:29.472 --> 47:32.141
Defend me, O God,
thy humble servant

47:32.266 --> 47:35.061
in all assaults of the enemy,

47:35.186 --> 47:36.729
that I,

47:36.854 --> 47:39.732
surely trusting in thy defense,

47:39.857 --> 47:44.320
may not fear the power
of the adversary,

47:44.445 --> 47:46.947
that the words of my mouth
and the meditation of my heart

47:47.073 --> 47:50.159
be always acceptable
in thy sight.

47:50.284 --> 47:53.871
O Lord, my strength
and my redeemer.

48:55.933 --> 48:57.226
You want to come in
and take a shower

48:57.351 --> 48:58.644
and brush your teeth?

48:58.769 --> 49:01.063
What? Yeah. Sure.

49:01.188 --> 49:02.898
You should've slept
with me.

49:03.023 --> 49:04.650
I wouldn't have done
anything scandalous.

49:04.775 --> 49:06.819
Promise.

49:06.944 --> 49:08.654
Got the key?

49:08.779 --> 49:09.947
I've got your purse.

49:43.981 --> 49:47.276
How, may I ask,
have I offended thee?

49:47.401 --> 49:49.111
Why ask me that?

49:49.236 --> 49:51.447
It's just something
written here.

49:51.572 --> 49:54.867
A lovely phrase, I think.
It speaks to me.

49:54.992 --> 49:56.994
Where's the young lady?

49:57.119 --> 49:58.370
What is all this?

49:58.496 --> 50:02.041
History, European mostly,
Renaissance and some

50:02.166 --> 50:04.293
remarkably incriminating
correspondence between

50:04.418 --> 50:07.755
The Vatican and the Spanish king
from the early 16th Century.

50:07.880 --> 50:10.299
No one's ever thought
to put it all in order.

50:10.424 --> 50:13.302
Some local antiquarian died,
and his moronic heirs

50:13.427 --> 50:14.970
donated it to this place.

50:15.095 --> 50:16.597
Imagine.

50:16.722 --> 50:17.973
You don't recognize me?

50:18.098 --> 50:20.309
No. Should I?

50:22.686 --> 50:25.022
I'm your son.

50:25.147 --> 50:27.608
Listen, kid,
I have lots of offspring.

50:27.733 --> 50:29.735
They're, you know, legion.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.612
You gotta do
better than that.

50:31.737 --> 50:33.030
I'm Ned.

50:42.706 --> 50:45.000
Fay's kid.

50:45.125 --> 50:46.919
Yeah.

50:54.635 --> 50:57.137
I suppose
you've come to kill me.

51:20.536 --> 51:22.788
I hear she's got
a life sentence.

51:22.913 --> 51:24.957
No parole, all that.

51:25.082 --> 51:26.834
Why did she come
looking for me?

51:29.712 --> 51:32.381
She thought
your life was in danger.

51:32.506 --> 51:34.883
People were trying to kill you.

51:35.009 --> 51:37.094
You should've talked
her out of it.

51:37.219 --> 51:39.263
She thought she was
doing it for my sake.

51:39.388 --> 51:41.181
- For your sake?
- Yeah.

51:41.307 --> 51:44.685
Like I needed a father figure
or something.

51:44.810 --> 51:50.399
I'm a wanted criminal,
a known felon, a murderer.

51:50.524 --> 51:53.193
I mean, I'm not apologizing,
but really, I know why.

51:53.319 --> 51:55.529
I mean, really, why.

51:55.654 --> 51:57.573
I hope I don't offend you, son,

51:57.698 --> 51:59.617
but your mother
has very complicated,

51:59.742 --> 52:02.411
perverse, and deeply repressed
sexual needs

52:02.536 --> 52:05.623
which, I, in my generosity,
was able to intuit and satisfy.

52:05.748 --> 52:06.999
She's never gotten over it.

52:07.124 --> 52:09.043
Sue me.
You gonna drink that?

52:14.131 --> 52:16.008
You, as it turns out,

52:16.133 --> 52:17.885
are the fruit
of that liberation.

52:18.010 --> 52:20.679
A son of the devil.

52:20.804 --> 52:22.848
You've been talking
with Dr. Ford.

52:29.938 --> 52:33.442
Listen, Ned--
can I call you Ned?

52:33.567 --> 52:36.028
I've got these mercenary quacks
by the cojones

52:36.153 --> 52:37.571
like nobody's business.

52:37.696 --> 52:39.698
I mean, really,
these guys are stinking of sin.

52:39.823 --> 52:41.867
You?

52:41.992 --> 52:43.452
I am, in fact,
suffering certain,

52:43.577 --> 52:44.662
definite side effects

52:44.787 --> 52:47.456
from this amalgamation of chemicals they
were feeding me,

52:47.581 --> 52:52.127
the constituent elements
of which are not even--

52:52.252 --> 52:55.047
Did you see that?

52:55.172 --> 52:56.173
No.

52:58.384 --> 53:02.471
The point is,
this is not really a bad place.

53:02.596 --> 53:04.056
What with the library here,

53:04.181 --> 53:05.891
and the park
and the regular meals,

53:06.016 --> 53:08.268
all I've got to do is pretend I'm insane
once or twice a week

53:08.394 --> 53:10.062
and tell them
this cock-and-bull story

53:10.187 --> 53:12.064
about being the devil
or whatever.

53:12.189 --> 53:14.400
This cache of Renaissance lit has
provided me with

53:14.525 --> 53:17.486
a treasure trove of
dates and places and names.

53:17.611 --> 53:19.613
These assholes are terrified.

53:21.281 --> 53:24.076
Look, mom wants me
to get you out of here

53:24.201 --> 53:25.494
and bring you home.

53:25.619 --> 53:27.788
Home?
How can we have a home

53:27.913 --> 53:29.581
when she's in prison
the rest of her life?

53:29.707 --> 53:31.083
She wants me, you,
and Uncle Simon

53:31.208 --> 53:33.168
to live nearby
and go visit her all the time.

53:33.293 --> 53:34.920
I'm sorry, I'll do anything
for Fay,

53:35.045 --> 53:36.296
but I can't live with Simon.

53:36.422 --> 53:38.215
That man is a disgrace.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.720
A publisher has paid her
to write her autobiography.

53:42.845 --> 53:46.098
She wants your help.

53:46.223 --> 53:47.933
Really?

53:48.058 --> 53:50.519
Yeah, she said so herself
that Simon couldn't have

53:50.644 --> 53:52.938
written a thing if not for you.

53:53.063 --> 53:54.523
Well, that's right.

53:54.648 --> 53:56.525
Exactly.

53:56.650 --> 53:58.610
That ungrateful climber,

53:58.736 --> 54:00.529
and now with this blog
and the sketch comedy.

54:00.654 --> 54:02.948
Where will it end?
It hurts to witness this.

54:03.073 --> 54:04.533
Who does he think he is?
Jerry Lewis?

54:04.658 --> 54:06.827
I've got-- wait a minute.
Hold on.

54:09.413 --> 54:10.873
Fuck.

54:14.752 --> 54:17.755
I've got a passage in here
somewhere about, you know,

54:17.880 --> 54:20.549
about Simon's passive-aggressive
will to power,

54:20.674 --> 54:22.968
and-- here it is.

54:23.093 --> 54:26.764
No, well, it's not about Simon, but it
pertains.

54:26.889 --> 54:29.516
Anyway, I need someone to
help me get all this in order.

54:29.641 --> 54:30.893
Can you type?

54:31.018 --> 54:33.771
No.
So are you coming?

54:33.896 --> 54:35.147
How will we get there?

54:35.272 --> 54:38.984
I am, as it were,
a wanted man.

54:39.109 --> 54:41.487
- We'll drive.
- Cross-country?

54:41.612 --> 54:43.572
Yeah.

54:43.697 --> 54:46.450
Will the young lady
be coming?

54:46.575 --> 54:47.826
Probably.

54:47.951 --> 54:49.787
Is she your girlfriend?

54:51.246 --> 54:52.498
We're just friends.

54:52.623 --> 54:56.168
I'm warning you, kid,
exteriors notwithstanding,

54:56.293 --> 54:59.129
girls just sorta
can't resist me.

54:59.254 --> 55:00.506
That must be a major hassle.

55:00.631 --> 55:03.008
I just don't want any
unnecessary resentment,

55:03.133 --> 55:04.468
if you know what I mean.

55:04.593 --> 55:05.844
This all you got?

55:05.969 --> 55:07.387
I'll need my own room.

55:07.513 --> 55:08.806
Fine. Come on.

55:08.931 --> 55:11.099
Wait up.
I gotta get dressed.

55:29.284 --> 55:30.536
Where are we?
I thought you said

55:30.661 --> 55:31.912
the motel was just
down the road?

55:32.037 --> 55:33.831
- It's not far.
- To be fair,

55:33.956 --> 55:35.624
Simon's third and
fourth books were pretty good,

55:35.749 --> 55:37.209
and I hadn't seen him in years.

55:37.334 --> 55:38.627
I read them in translation,
of course,

55:38.752 --> 55:40.045
being in exile and everything.

55:40.170 --> 55:41.922
It's clear he allowed
himself to be influenced

55:42.047 --> 55:44.216
by the dynamics of his own
notoriety, so to speak.

55:44.341 --> 55:47.636
Can you hold that
farther away?

55:47.761 --> 55:49.972
- Don't you agree?
- About what?

55:50.097 --> 55:51.223
Simon's third and fourth books.

55:51.348 --> 55:52.975
- I don't read poetry.
- What do you read?

55:53.100 --> 55:55.060
I read what really matters.

55:55.185 --> 55:56.687
Oh, you mean, like,
The "New York Times"?

55:56.812 --> 55:58.647
No.

55:58.772 --> 56:00.440
No, shit, you're
a God-fearing man?

56:00.566 --> 56:02.943
- You got a problem with that?
- Find someplace to pull over.

56:03.068 --> 56:04.862
What?

56:04.987 --> 56:06.238
Gotta pee.

57:31.448 --> 57:33.075
"Coffee product."

57:33.200 --> 57:34.743
It's free.

57:34.868 --> 57:36.578
The donuts are
fresh this morning.

57:36.703 --> 57:37.955
Hi.

57:38.080 --> 57:41.041
Oh, this is quaint
in a desperate sort of way.

57:41.166 --> 57:43.126
Ah, we meet finally.

57:43.251 --> 57:46.588
That's a fetching ensemble.

57:46.713 --> 57:48.507
- There's free coffee product.
- Is there?

57:48.632 --> 57:50.467
- And semi-fresh donuts.
- Excellent.

57:50.592 --> 57:52.177
Ned, are you gonna introduce us,

57:52.302 --> 57:54.596
or did your mother teach you
no manners at all?

57:54.721 --> 57:56.598
- This is Susan.
- Fascinating.

57:56.723 --> 57:59.017
Come on. We're leaving.

57:59.142 --> 58:01.186
Soldier of God or not,
that kid's got a hair

58:01.311 --> 58:02.938
across his ass.

58:03.063 --> 58:04.523
Yes, he's very devout.

58:04.648 --> 58:07.359
Maybe we should get
some donuts for the road, huh?

58:07.484 --> 58:08.694
Can I hold that for you?

58:08.819 --> 58:12.155
Guard it with your life,
young lady.

58:12.280 --> 58:13.907
Is this the confessions?

58:14.032 --> 58:17.536
I see my reputation
has preceded me.

58:17.661 --> 58:20.706
I did my graduate dissertation
on the work of Simon Grim.

58:20.831 --> 58:21.832
Is that so?

58:21.957 --> 58:24.334
Yes, and because
of that, I guess,

58:24.459 --> 58:27.546
I was hired to ghost-write
your wife's autobiography.

58:27.671 --> 58:29.297
Oh, you're practically family.

58:29.423 --> 58:30.799
That's not sugar.
That's Sweet 'N Low.

58:30.924 --> 58:32.092
The sugar's right there.

58:32.217 --> 58:33.510
Well, that's good.

58:33.635 --> 58:35.387
Fay can't spell
to save her life.

58:35.512 --> 58:37.514
- Do you type?
- Very well.

58:37.639 --> 58:38.765
And I'm
a great copy editor.

58:38.890 --> 58:40.225
I can use some help
with this.

58:40.350 --> 58:43.478
I'd love to.
I mean, if that's okay.

58:43.603 --> 58:45.814
Good, it needs some--

58:45.939 --> 58:50.193
Oh, did you see that?

58:50.318 --> 58:51.319
No.

58:55.574 --> 58:57.868
You remind me of someone.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.251
Okay, okay!

59:06.376 --> 59:08.045
He hates me, of course.

59:08.170 --> 59:10.547
So embarrassingly oedipal.

59:10.672 --> 59:12.299
Come on.

59:15.552 --> 59:18.096
So, it's like this: In the infinite
amplitude of his love,

59:18.221 --> 59:19.848
God wants to create
the largest number

59:19.973 --> 59:21.266
of best elements that can exist together
in one cosmos.

59:22.809 --> 59:25.729
Okay, that's a spin on Leibniz, but the
important part is next.

59:25.854 --> 59:27.439
- Do I write that?
- No, hold on.

59:27.564 --> 59:30.567
In an instantaneous
calculation made in eternity,

59:30.692 --> 59:32.652
God computes the best
possible world and creates it.

59:32.778 --> 59:34.279
Okay, fine.

59:34.404 --> 59:36.865
This decision,
as it were, by God,

59:36.990 --> 59:39.910
is uncontingent and eternal,
rather than temporally

59:40.035 --> 59:41.536
or ontologically sequential.

59:41.661 --> 59:43.330
- Mmm...
- What?

59:43.455 --> 59:46.458
Do you think that's
the right word?

59:46.583 --> 59:47.709
Temporally?

59:47.834 --> 59:49.669
No, ontologically.

59:49.795 --> 59:51.421
What do you suggest?

59:51.546 --> 59:54.424
It's just that the nature of
being is already the subject

59:54.549 --> 59:55.884
of the passage itself.

59:56.009 --> 59:58.428
I think you should move on
from the idea of temporality

59:58.553 --> 01:00:00.305
to something more
materially concrete.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.600
Spatiality, right. Or--

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:06.728
We'll stop here for the night.

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:11.817
Anyway, the point, Susan,
it is impossible for every

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.903
perfect good to be compatible
with every other perfect good.

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:17.114
The holiness of the mountain
needs to be contrasted

01:00:17.239 --> 01:00:20.158
with the profanity of the
used condom on the sidewalk

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.493
- so to speak.
- Good image,

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.328
Should I write that?

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:28.083
The good of free will must
entail real choices for sin.

01:00:31.086 --> 01:00:32.504
Something like that.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:33.880
We'll continue tomorrow.

01:00:48.103 --> 01:00:50.355
We need three
single rooms please.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.566
Uh-oh, I'm afraid we only
have one single

01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:53.859
and a suite available.

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.152
A suite?

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:57.529
Two rooms, a full kitchen,
and a jacuzzi.

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:59.531
A class establishment,
obviously.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:02.200
I once participated in the
most fantastic group sex

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:04.494
in a hot tub outside in the mountains
while it was snowing.

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:06.621
Where was that?
Doesn't matter.

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:08.373
- How about you?
- He'll have the suite.

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:10.500
- We'll take the single.
- I'll be in the bar.

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.216
What?

01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:23.972
You're flirting
with my father.

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:25.807
Am I?

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:29.144
He's... he's fun.

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:31.354
Are you kidding me?

01:01:31.479 --> 01:01:33.648
He appreciates my ideas.

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:35.775
I like the way
he thinks.

01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:37.986
He's a degenerate.

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:40.155
Give him three minutes alone,
and he'd rape you.

01:01:41.823 --> 01:01:44.409
I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:47.412
Yeah, well, maybe you're
right, seeing as I don't know

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:50.999
what you're
capable of yourself.

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:54.461
What's that
supposed to mean?

01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:55.754
Give me the bullet.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:00.425
What bullet?

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:08.308
That's all the cash I have.

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:09.809
Take it. Get lost.

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:11.853
You're not traveling
with us.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.359
- Is there a church around here?
- Lots.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:21.655
Catholic, Methodist, Baptist, Seventh
Day Adventist, a mosque.

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:22.948
It doesn't matter.

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:24.908
Catholic's right
across the parking lot.

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:37.170
I was wondering how long

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:38.672
you'd be able
to stand that guy.

01:02:38.797 --> 01:02:40.048
Get dressed, you have
to get out of here.

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:41.466
What are you talking about?

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:44.135
The young, Christian
gentleman's paying for it all.

01:02:44.261 --> 01:02:45.512
There's a jacuzzi upstairs.

01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:47.847
The young Christian gentleman
has every intention

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:49.349
of killing you.

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:50.809
Here's his gun.

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:52.394
This is the bullet.

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:53.770
I didn't think he
had it in him.

01:02:53.895 --> 01:02:55.146
He does.

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:56.982
I've heard him
say his prayers.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:59.484
- God's on his side, I suppose.
- Apparently.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:00.860
And so, you mean to say,

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:03.738
Fay doesn't need my help
with her memoir?

01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:06.116
Is that what he told you?

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:14.582
- That's low.
- You got any money?

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:16.876
Yeah, I stole his bank card.

01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:18.795
He's got his pin code
written on a Post-It note

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.171
and everything.

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.882
- Very generous of him.
- I know, right?

01:03:23.008 --> 01:03:24.676
You'd think a religion would
help teach people how

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.094
the ungodly operate.

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:27.804
Let me get dressed.

01:03:27.929 --> 01:03:29.931
Take all the good stuff
from the mini bar.

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:51.661
What have I done?

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:57.792
I might've killed a man
but for this woman.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.923
Have you sent her?

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:06.051
Placed her in my path
to keep me from sin?

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:16.936
I'll set everything right.
I'll make amends.

01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:21.066
Jesus, I don't want
to kill anyone.

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.741
Wow.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.159
Lots?

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:35.497
He's loaded, but we can
only withdraw $400 a day.

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:54.057
I really can't believe
that sanctimonious

01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:56.184
little church mouse is my son.

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:58.395
- Forget about it.
- Where are we going, anyway?

01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.979
I mean,
New York, right?

01:05:00.105 --> 01:05:03.066
All points on the globe are
equally dismal for me, Susan.

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:07.028
Unwanted, unappreciated,
despised even by my own son.

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:08.822
We can make it in maybe
three or four days,

01:05:08.947 --> 01:05:11.616
depending on when
Ned unplugs our credit line.

01:05:11.741 --> 01:05:13.118
I called ahead and reserved
a motel room

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:14.619
just this side of Spokane.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:16.204
Do they have a restaurant,
you think?

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:18.331
No, but the rooms have kitchens.

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:20.708
- Ned.
- Simon...

01:05:20.834 --> 01:05:22.419
I almost did a real bad thing.

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:23.586
Your mother thought
you might.

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:25.463
Mom? How?

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:27.674
She received a visit
from the Reverend Gardner.

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:30.260
Oh, man.

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:31.719
Have you found Henry?

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:34.139
- Yes.
- Is he with you now?

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:37.142
No, I lost him.
He disappeared again.

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:39.727
He ran off with some woman
I was traveling with.

01:05:39.853 --> 01:05:41.354
Susan?

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:43.231
Yeah.

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:47.402
Ned, how much do you know
about your dad's early years?

01:05:47.527 --> 01:05:48.736
More than I want to.

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:50.738
Well, he spent some
time in prison.

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:54.325
Right, that much I got.

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.077
Do you know why he
was in prison?

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:58.121
Mom said he hadn't paid
his taxes or something.

01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:01.374
No, Henry was in jail for
7 years because he was

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:03.168
caught in flagrante delicto

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:05.253
with, as he once told me
in confidence,

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:11.468
an ugly and mean-spirited 13-year-old
girl named Susan.

01:06:11.593 --> 01:06:12.969
You think this is that Susan?

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:15.013
I'm certain of it.
I've read her dissertation.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:17.515
It's a long, wild,
passionate encomium to Henry.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.766
A what?

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:21.227
And she's ghost-writing
your mom's autobiography.

01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:22.604
No way! That's her?

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:23.980
She's obsessed with Henry.

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:26.024
Oh, damn it.
Then let them be.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:28.526
They're both nuts anyway.
He's an idiot, she's a floozy.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:30.612
They both read too much.
They're made for each other.

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:33.531
- I'm coming home.
- But she might do him harm.

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:35.783
You think?

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:37.535
She's been in and out of
psychiatric hospitals her

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.913
whole life, and she stabbed
a man in college when they

01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:42.332
refused to let her graduate.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:45.668
What was your impression?

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:49.714
She's armed.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:53.301
Is she?

01:06:57.305 --> 01:06:59.891
Ned, you've got to find them.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.100
I know.

01:07:01.226 --> 01:07:03.144
Susan's brilliant,
and she's a good person,

01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:04.521
but she's totally fucked up.

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:06.147
I know.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:07.649
We could probably say the same
thing about your dad,

01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:09.651
but I suspect you don't want
to hear that right now.

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:10.902
You're right, Uncle Simon,
I don't want to

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:13.029
hear that right now.
Listen, I'll call you tomorrow.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:18.826
Stateside Mutual Customer
Service, how can I help you?

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:20.995
Yeah, my bank card
has been stolen.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.539
Would you like me
to cancel the card?

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:25.833
Yes, and wait--

01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:27.335
Excuse me?

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.629
Will you be able to tell me
where the card was last used?

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:31.589
Of course,
the exact time and location.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:34.133
Okay, don't cancel
the card just yet.

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:37.053
- Really? Are you sure?
- I'll call back in a few hours.

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:38.763
A lot of damage can occur
in a few hours, sir.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:40.306
I know.

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:41.933
We should get
some booze.

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:43.810
Can you get me
some rum, please?

01:07:43.935 --> 01:07:45.395
There's a liquor store
across the parking lot.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.564
- Rum, huh?
- And whatever you're drinking.

01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:49.566
- I'll get something to cook.
- What do you smoke?

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:54.946
Whatever.
Fairport Lights are okay.

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:56.906
An embarrassment of riches!

01:08:14.841 --> 01:08:16.759
We'll need a knife.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.894
All set?

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.062
Anything else?

01:08:28.187 --> 01:08:30.814
Ice cubes.
I'll get napkins.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:33.109
Oh, and lemonade.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:54.589
Susan?

01:09:05.433 --> 01:09:08.019
Rum, lemonade,
and Fairport Lights.

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:11.564
These were your
preferred poisons at 13.

01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:13.149
Why didn't you
come back for me?

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:15.026
- What?
- I waited.

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:18.196
They put me in jail
for seven years.

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.113
But I was 20
by the time you got out.

01:09:20.238 --> 01:09:22.867
I wasn't allowed into the
state of Ohio without written

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:24.452
permission from some office
of the governor,

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:26.662
and only then if I could prove
I had gainful employment.

01:09:26.787 --> 01:09:30.667
Look, Susan, I paid dearly for
our little afternoon of bliss.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:32.877
I really did think my parents were away
for the weekend.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:35.421
I had no idea they
would come back.

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:37.048
Aw, Susan.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:40.009
Susan, what my life might've
been if I'd never met you.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.345
- I'm sorry.
- Please don't apologize.

01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:45.723
What's done is done
and I shouldn't have done it.

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:47.892
- I wanted you to.
- You were 13.

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:50.560
You didn't know what you wanted.

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.939
I did.
I did know what I wanted.

01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:55.066
Susan, it's like I've
been trying to get at.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.484
There is sin in this world.

01:09:56.609 --> 01:09:58.069
I haven't worked it out
perfectly yet,

01:09:58.194 --> 01:09:59.237
but if there is
such a thing as sin,

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:00.488
it comes down to this.

01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:01.906
Taking advantage of innocence.

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:04.325
I was not innocent.
How dare you say that.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:06.119
You were the only
one I wanted.

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:08.246
Yes, the only one stupid
enough to succumb to the

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:10.707
advances of an overweight
and perspiring adolescent

01:10:10.832 --> 01:10:12.500
with bad teeth.

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:15.712
What happened?

01:10:15.837 --> 01:10:17.422
I grew up.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:19.173
Well, you've got a nice ass.

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:21.342
I had braces
until I was 26.

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.010
You could use
a few pounds, though.

01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:24.804
I was anorexic for a while.

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:26.097
No.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:28.516
I'm okay now,
but it wasn't so bad,

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:30.101
because I was in
a hospital anyways.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:32.103
What kind of hospital?

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:33.855
The kind for crazy people.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:35.940
- Oh, no.
- No, it wasn't like that.

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:39.110
They thought I was crazy
because I was in love with you.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:40.486
Well, they were right.

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:41.988
I was the janitor at
your junior high school.

01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:44.615
You turned me on to Lautreamont.

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:47.577
- Did I?
- And Verlaine, Rimbaud.

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:49.537
- Really?
- All the French symbolists.

01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:51.956
Of course, I outgrew them,
but they were formative.

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:54.167
Yeah, well, but still,
there are limits.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:56.627
I mean,
there are laws even.

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:59.380
Hi. It's me again--
Edward Rifle.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:01.132
Oh, yes, Mr. Rifle.

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:04.552
The card was used near
Spokane 45 minutes ago

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:07.180
at a supermarket on Route 47.

01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:11.851
That was the best day of my life.

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:13.561
It was astonishing.

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:14.896
I mean, at least,
until your father

01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:17.565
was standing there
and the police arrived.

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:20.568
I remember every moment of it.

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:23.946
I put myself to sleep at night
for years replaying it again,

01:11:24.071 --> 01:11:26.115
and again.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.992
Every touch.

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:30.161
Each thrust.

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:33.915
The taste of your dirty
fingers in my mouth.

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.043
How I clutched the bedspread
and drooled.

01:11:41.839 --> 01:11:45.301
And now we can be together,
you and me finally,

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:49.013
without any interference.

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:50.598
Is that what you want?

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:54.727
More than anything
in the world.

01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:19.627
Henry: I'm not an easy man
to live with, Susan.

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:21.212
I could just follow you,

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:23.047
yours whenever you want me.

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:25.675
- You're incorrigible.
- Thank you.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.593
Woman: Outrageous!

01:12:27.718 --> 01:12:29.679
You people
are disgusting!

01:12:29.804 --> 01:12:31.848
Why, a man your age ought to know better
than to--

01:12:31.973 --> 01:12:33.766
Come on! Come on!
It's not our business.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:37.562
Pervert!

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:41.774
And so you stabbed the guy?

01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:45.403
All semester long he's
encouraging me to revise

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:48.573
and to annotate and insisting
we meet after class to discuss

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:52.243
and, well, of course, fuck,
and then he totally goes along

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:53.870
with the other department
heads and dismisses

01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:56.247
the dissertation as not
worthy of consideration.

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:58.499
- What's this for?
- The tomatoes.

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:00.251
- You still hungry?
- Not really.

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:03.546
Give me your glass.

01:13:03.671 --> 01:13:06.799
These self-satisfied pundits
who, themselves received

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:10.928
master's degrees for writing
college papers on post-Marxist

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:14.473
third generation feminist
apocrypha or whatever,

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:17.518
now have these high-paid
tenured positions lock-step

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:20.646
with college policy, pushing
only commercially sustainable

01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:24.066
mass-cultural phenomena,
proudly detailing the most

01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:26.903
profitably, impermanent
trends as critically relevant

01:13:27.028 --> 01:13:29.697
societal indicators for the
next really cool Facebook ad,

01:13:29.822 --> 01:13:31.198
et cetera.

01:13:31.324 --> 01:13:34.118
I mean,
am I repeating myself?

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:35.912
God, I love it when you
get all fired up

01:13:36.037 --> 01:13:38.372
and indignant like this.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:41.667
Fuck me.

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:40.351
Hello, ladies.

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:43.896
Welcome to the first meeting
of the Penitentiary Book Club.

01:14:44.021 --> 01:14:45.648
Since we're all gonna be
here for, well,

01:14:45.773 --> 01:14:46.774
like, the rest of our lives,

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:48.985
I figured we should start out with some

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:54.782
really big books like these.

01:14:54.907 --> 01:15:01.372
"Don Quixote"
by Cervantes, 941 pages.

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:07.795
"War and Peace," Tolstoy,
1,443 pages.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:08.921
"Les Miserables."

01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:11.882
They made a musical out of
this one by Victor Hugo,

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:14.093
1,232 pages.

01:15:14.218 --> 01:15:16.804
Older man, young woman.

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:18.973
Yeah, high heels,
that's right.

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:29.191
Dad's home!

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:41.495
Good morning.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.998
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:45.249
Are you, by any chance,

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:47.043
headed toward
the city of Spokane?

01:15:47.168 --> 01:15:48.919
Well, yeah, sort of.

01:15:49.045 --> 01:15:51.464
I'd appreciate a lift,
if you'd be so kind.

01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:54.800
- Absolutely not!
- Amelia, please.

01:15:54.925 --> 01:15:57.553
Just drop me anywhere along
the road in that direction.

01:15:57.678 --> 01:15:58.679
Thanks.

01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:50.898
Look, young man, we don't want any
trouble around here.

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:52.525
I'm just looking
for my friends.

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:58.531
- Henry!?
- I can't do this to her again.

01:16:58.656 --> 01:16:59.907
I'll get off here.

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:01.325
Man: There's nothing
here for miles.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.743
Yeah, but I gotta
take a shit.

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:03.911
Amelia:
Dear God almighty.

01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:05.704
The filth that comes
out of his mouth.

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:08.165
Let him go. Let him go!
Let him go.

01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:17.424
Ned: I don't want to
cause any trouble.

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:18.634
I'm just gonna wait here
in the car

01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:21.804
till my friends wake up.

01:17:21.929 --> 01:17:22.930
Okay?

01:17:58.507 --> 01:17:59.884
Dad.

01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:31.373
Save her.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.215
No, please.

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.836
Run.

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:52.389
No.
