WEBVTT

00:02.529 --> 00:03.580
We're doomed.

00:03.729 --> 00:05.759
- We can make a break for it.
- Impossible.

00:06.129 --> 00:08.300
- Front exit?
- We'd be spotted instantly.

00:09.130 --> 00:10.460
Back door?

00:11.529 --> 00:13.419
- Blocked.
- That's it, then.

00:13.929 --> 00:16.739
- We're trapped.
- We might try shouting "fire!"

00:18.129 --> 00:19.850
It's not a crowded theater.

00:19.929 --> 00:22.460
One day I might, yes...

00:23.530 --> 00:27.989
...many years from now,
when I've lost my looks a little.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.070
Do not laugh.

00:31.929 --> 00:33.009
Only another hour.

00:33.729 --> 00:37.170
I mean, of course, a time will come...

00:37.929 --> 00:40.250
...when Torvald is not....

00:40.929 --> 00:42.469
He's not....

00:45.130 --> 00:47.340
- Line!
- "Is not as devoted to me."

00:47.530 --> 00:48.469
Perhaps two.

00:48.729 --> 00:50.340
- What?
- "Is not as devoted."

00:51.130 --> 00:52.710
Right, right, right.

00:52.929 --> 00:56.479
When Torvald is not as devoted to me.

00:58.329 --> 01:00.189
And I thought I knew eternity.

01:52.409 --> 01:54.689
So, what did you guys think?

01:56.010 --> 01:57.799
Well, your projection was excellent.

01:58.409 --> 02:01.010
I could hear every word,
and we were way in the back.

02:02.010 --> 02:04.500
Okay, so I was loud,
but was I any good?

02:05.010 --> 02:07.849
You took the role
and made it your own.

02:08.610 --> 02:12.229
Really?  Thanks.
Angel, was I good?

02:13.409 --> 02:16.110
- I wouldn't say if I didn't think so.
- Thanks.

02:17.009 --> 02:18.270
- You didn't say.
- I didn't?

02:18.810 --> 02:21.830
- I don't believe it!
- It was a night I'll never forget.

02:22.409 --> 02:23.490
That's Oliver Simon!

02:24.810 --> 02:25.680
Who?

02:26.009 --> 02:28.569
One of the most important
talent managers in town.

02:29.009 --> 02:30.689
I met him at a party.
You were there.

02:31.409 --> 02:32.389
Oh, right.

02:35.610 --> 02:37.009
- He gave me his card.
- What?

02:37.409 --> 02:39.620
I worked him all night
and he gave you his card?

02:40.409 --> 02:42.020
He thought I had a "quality."

02:43.409 --> 02:44.710
Look who he's with!

02:45.810 --> 02:46.860
Can we please go now?

02:47.009 --> 02:48.830
- Rebecca Lowell!
- Who?

02:50.009 --> 02:52.849
Raven! She played
Raven in On Your Own,

02:53.610 --> 02:56.099
Hit television show,
on for, like, 9½ years.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.560
- Do either of you even own a TV?
- I don't.

03:00.210 --> 03:03.509
It was a seminal show,
canceled by the idiot network.

03:04.409 --> 03:07.250
I was gonna picket, but
I didn't have comfortable shoes....

03:15.810 --> 03:17.349
Angel!

03:21.810 --> 03:23.280
Oh, my God, Rebecca!

03:26.009 --> 03:27.449
Are you all right, darling?

03:29.610 --> 03:32.240
Oh, my God!  What was she like?

03:35.610 --> 03:37.500
Excuse me.  Are you all right?

03:38.009 --> 03:41.270
Oh, he's fine.  It was such an honor
to save your life, Miss Lowell.

03:42.210 --> 03:44.840
Thank you.
I'm sorry, I didn't get your name.

03:45.210 --> 03:47.979
Cordelia Chase.
I'm so glad you weren't--

03:48.810 --> 03:51.689
Oh, he doesn't even know who you are.

03:53.009 --> 03:54.689
You don't know me?

03:55.409 --> 03:58.669
Sure, he doesn't.  I'm sure
he'll accept a small reward anyway.

03:59.610 --> 04:02.030
- No, thanks.
- We're not gonna be held up here.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.400
Oliver, down.
He doesn't know who I am.

04:05.009 --> 04:07.080
He's culturally retarded that way.

04:08.610 --> 04:09.800
I'm Rebecca.

04:10.409 --> 04:11.139
Angel.

04:11.610 --> 04:14.069
So, you make a habit
of this sort of thing?

04:14.610 --> 04:17.769
It's only like his purpose in life.
Angel's the Dark Revenger.

04:18.810 --> 04:20.420
Only not too dark.  Happy dark.

04:21.209 --> 04:24.050
- I got a card in here somewhere.
- Cordelia.

04:24.810 --> 04:26.350
Oh, God. Who called E.T.?

04:26.610 --> 04:28.750
- Emma Thompson?
- Entertainment Tonight, doofus.

04:29.610 --> 04:31.360
- They're here for the party.
- Oliver....

04:32.009 --> 04:34.360
It's gonna be all over
the tabs come morning, Beck.

04:34.410 --> 04:36.899
We might as well just put
our own spin on it first.

04:38.009 --> 04:40.610
- Look, I'd like to apologize....
- Oh, he does that.

04:41.009 --> 04:45.579
Here's our card.  If you need rescuing
or just want to pal around, call us.

04:47.009 --> 04:48.620
- Let go.
- Come on.

04:56.769 --> 05:00.319
I made the papers.  Last night's all
over the front page of the Calendar!

05:00.970 --> 05:03.069
Really?  There was a
reviewer at your play?

05:03.970 --> 05:07.300
What? No!  Like a reviewer needs
to see some 100-year-old play.

05:08.170 --> 05:10.629
The thing with Rebecca Lowell.
I'm in the picture.

05:11.170 --> 05:12.750
- Where?
- Right there.

05:13.569 --> 05:15.990
- Where?
- Right there, next to Rebecca.

05:16.569 --> 05:18.079
That's my elbow.

05:18.970 --> 05:21.990
Can we forget about Rebecca Lowell?
I mean, we ran into an actor.

05:22.569 --> 05:26.120
It's Hollywood, it happens.
We have a nice photo of Cordelia's...

05:26.769 --> 05:28.839
...elbow and an article about
me saving a TV star.

05:29.769 --> 05:32.160
- Just because the paper--
- There's no mention of you.

05:32.170 --> 05:34.449
- What?
- Nothing.

05:37.569 --> 05:40.199
Well, that's good, right?

05:41.170 --> 05:43.870
I mean, this high-profile thing
isn't our deal anyway.

05:44.170 --> 05:45.040
What?

05:45.370 --> 05:48.040
Rebecca hasn't had a series since
On Your Own was canceled.

05:48.970 --> 05:50.860
That was almost
a season and a half ago.

05:51.370 --> 05:53.300
And they say Los Angeles
has no seasons.

05:53.769 --> 05:57.490
We have to use this now, before she's
just another E! True Hollywood Story,

05:57.970 --> 06:00.360
When word gets out that you're
protector to the stars...

06:00.970 --> 06:02.689
...they'll line up at the door.

06:03.370 --> 06:05.120
Glad I beat the crowd, then.

06:06.970 --> 06:08.829
Oh, my God. No!

06:11.170 --> 06:14.610
I didn't mean--  Coffee, tea?
We don't have anything good here.

06:15.970 --> 06:20.540
But our intern would be happy
to get you something, Miss Lowell.

06:22.569 --> 06:24.079
Can we talk?

06:24.370 --> 06:26.300
Sure, right in here.

06:27.970 --> 06:28.839
Stay.

06:33.370 --> 06:34.379
Stay.

06:48.970 --> 06:51.600
- You're not fond of sunshine.
- I'm a night person.

06:52.569 --> 06:53.759
Me too.

06:54.970 --> 06:58.620
It makes it easier to hide.

06:59.769 --> 07:02.019
You're in the wrong
business if you want to hide.

07:03.970 --> 07:08.290
So you never really saw even one
single episode of On Your Own?

07:08.769 --> 07:09.850
No.

07:11.769 --> 07:13.100
Well, stop by.

07:14.170 --> 07:17.610
I'll give you a private screening of
the episode I didn't win the Emmy for.

07:20.170 --> 07:22.379
Thanks for the invitation, but....

07:23.170 --> 07:26.290
Look, I've been famous since I was 14.

07:26.769 --> 07:30.319
It's refreshing to meet
someone who doesn't care.

07:32.170 --> 07:34.629
Seems you're surrounded by
people who care about you.

07:35.170 --> 07:38.290
They work for me.
They're paid to care.

07:39.970 --> 07:41.620
So how can I help you?

07:47.769 --> 07:51.980
I have a stack of these at home.
All the same, written in blood.

07:53.170 --> 07:55.699
He also has my personal
telephone number.

07:56.170 --> 07:58.339
Scary calls in the
middle of the night.

07:58.569 --> 08:01.519
Most of my devoted fans are
harmless, but these--

08:02.170 --> 08:04.519
- It's not blood.
- Are you sure?

08:05.769 --> 08:08.509
- Have you tried the police?
- Oliver wants me to, but...

08:09.370 --> 08:12.949
...then I'd be just hand-feeding the
story to the Enquirer,  No, thanks.

08:13.569 --> 08:15.670
How do you know I won't do the same?

08:17.170 --> 08:21.170
I don't, but I know you came out of
nowhere and saved my life last night.

08:21.970 --> 08:24.389
I know you didn't ask
for anything in return.

08:24.970 --> 08:29.540
And I know I feel safer in this
office than I do in my own home.

08:35.769 --> 08:37.629
I'm up for a new series.

08:38.769 --> 08:42.909
One of those make-or-break gigs
for Rebecca's career, part two.

08:45.970 --> 08:50.110
I need peace of mind.

08:52.570 --> 08:54.529
The car that ran you down was...

08:54.970 --> 08:58.269
...a green, freshly-painted
'76 Chevy Nova.

08:59.169 --> 09:02.330
I caught the plates, ran the I.D.
It was stolen.

09:03.970 --> 09:07.059
And I'm sorry, but
I can't take your case.

09:08.169 --> 09:09.710
Are you insane?

09:12.370 --> 09:15.000
- I don't understand.
- Give that information to your people.

09:15.370 --> 09:18.460
They'll find the guy.
You don't need me.

09:24.210 --> 09:27.720
My first big connection in Hollywood,
and you throw her out of the office.

09:29.009 --> 09:30.200
Ever hear of networking?

09:30.210 --> 09:31.080
- Cordelia--
- No!

09:31.409 --> 09:35.169
He can fight off donkey demons
who rip people's guts out...

09:36.210 --> 09:38.700
...but he can't help a defenseless
actress from a psycho?

09:39.210 --> 09:40.679
What is your thing?

09:42.809 --> 09:44.139
He likes her.

09:45.809 --> 09:47.700
He's afraid of getting close.

09:50.009 --> 09:51.409
Because of his curse?

09:52.409 --> 09:54.730
You'd have to get awfully close
for that to kick in.

09:55.409 --> 09:56.740
Meanwhile, you could help me.

09:57.210 --> 09:59.490
The person who needs
help is Miss Lowell.

10:00.210 --> 10:03.399
Right, he could be helping us both.
Think of the karma.

10:03.809 --> 10:05.879
This may not be
the right case for you.

10:06.210 --> 10:08.490
Maybe we can find somebody
else to help her.

10:09.809 --> 10:11.950
Oh, no.  Not now!

10:14.009 --> 10:15.799
What's this I see in my vision?

10:17.009 --> 10:20.269
It's a figure, a woman.
It's Rebecca!  She's in danger.

10:20.610 --> 10:23.029
Terrible danger!

10:28.409 --> 10:29.919
Great, just great.

10:30.210 --> 10:33.539
Because Mr. Distant has intimacy
issues, I lose my brush with fame.

10:34.409 --> 10:38.799
- Jeez, Cordelia, she's just a person.
- Spoken like a true non-person.

10:41.009 --> 10:43.289
Just knowing a star
makes your life better.

10:44.009 --> 10:45.799
I'd do anything to live in her world!

10:47.009 --> 10:51.259
They make an incision behind the jaw,
under the eyes and suction out fat.

10:53.009 --> 10:54.799
Be proactive with deterioration.

10:55.409 --> 10:57.620
- Right.
- Christiana had it done at 24.

12:08.009 --> 12:09.169
Are you...?

12:21.210 --> 12:24.690
Miss Lowell, are you okay?
I'm calling the police.

12:32.570 --> 12:36.639
Yes, Oliver, I am sure.
I'd rather be alone tonight.

12:37.370 --> 12:40.559
After all this?  Don't you
at least want someone in the house?

12:40.970 --> 12:45.289
Half the LAPD is camped out on my
front lawn.  He won't be back tonight.

12:46.370 --> 12:49.139
All right, I should probably
go deal with the press.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.299
You do that, Oliver.

12:52.370 --> 12:53.629
I love you, kiddo.

12:56.570 --> 12:58.889
- You know that.
- I know.

13:15.769 --> 13:17.590
I know you're still here.

13:24.769 --> 13:26.169
I'm not what you think.

13:27.169 --> 13:28.360
You're not?

13:28.970 --> 13:30.129
Because...

13:31.370 --> 13:33.649
...no reflection,
dark private office...

13:34.370 --> 13:36.830
...knowing those letters
weren't written in blood.

13:37.370 --> 13:39.860
I guess what I would think
is "vampire."

13:40.970 --> 13:42.649
- Then again--
- Which is impossible.

13:43.370 --> 13:46.179
Bela Lugosi, Gary Oldman,
they're vampires.

13:47.570 --> 13:49.429
I believed
Frank Langella's performance--

13:49.370 --> 13:50.600
This is real.

13:52.370 --> 13:53.769
You're real.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.639
Do you drink blood?

13:59.570 --> 14:01.360
Yeah, but not people.

14:02.570 --> 14:04.320
- You're not a killer.
- I gave that up.

14:04.970 --> 14:08.450
Well, there's a support group for
everything in this town, I guess.

14:09.169 --> 14:11.419
- It's a long story.
- How long?

14:12.169 --> 14:13.919
- A hundred years?
- Two...

14:14.570 --> 14:16.250
...hundred and some change.

14:16.370 --> 14:19.000
Two hundred years?
But you look....

14:20.570 --> 14:22.669
If I touch you, will you be cold?

14:27.769 --> 14:29.309
I've felt colder.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.980
You're really not afraid.

14:33.769 --> 14:34.539
No.

14:34.970 --> 14:38.590
- Most people who saw what you saw--
- I'm not "most people."

14:42.169 --> 14:43.750
I lied to Oliver.

14:44.570 --> 14:47.129
I don't really want
to be alone tonight.

14:58.210 --> 15:01.120
- He took the case?
- Yes, he phoned early this morning.

15:01.809 --> 15:03.389
We follow up on the stolen car.

15:03.610 --> 15:06.000
- What made him change his mind?
- Apparently, he didn't.

15:06.610 --> 15:08.399
He was keeping tabs on her all along.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.750
- And he called you early this morning?
- Yes.

15:13.210 --> 15:16.049
- Weren't you lobbying for this?
- How early?

15:16.809 --> 15:18.210
Did he spend the night?

15:18.610 --> 15:20.190
- One assumes.
- Great.

15:20.409 --> 15:23.820
He spent the night with the
fantasy of millions, all alone.

15:24.610 --> 15:27.210
- "Protecting" her.
- You're worried about the curse.

15:27.610 --> 15:28.549
- I wouldn't.
- Hey!

15:29.409 --> 15:31.759
You weren't around the last
time Angel went mental.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.940
I was on the first wave
of the cleanup crew.

15:35.409 --> 15:39.340
He knows perfect happiness, he goes
evil.  Don't tell me not to worry.

15:40.210 --> 15:42.879
Angel's moment of happiness
occurred when he was with Buffy.

15:43.210 --> 15:46.399
Do you realize how rare that is?
True happiness?

15:48.009 --> 15:51.340
- He won't find it with an actress.
- What's that supposed to mean?

15:54.009 --> 15:56.610
I was....

15:58.210 --> 16:00.279
- I meant TV actress.
- Save it.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.580
Angel spent the night at Rebecca's.
I owe it to that poor girl...

16:05.409 --> 16:08.919
...to see if he wound up chowing
down on my one link to fame.

16:15.009 --> 16:18.870
Cordelia, you're here.
And you brought a cross.

16:19.809 --> 16:22.200
Along with three double
half-caf nonfat skinny lattés.

16:22.809 --> 16:23.970
- And a cross.
- Well...

16:24.009 --> 16:26.149
...judging by the outfit,
it's safe to come in.

16:27.009 --> 16:29.330
Evil Angel never would've
worn those pants.

16:31.210 --> 16:33.529
- Where's Rebecca?
- She had a lunch to go to.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.809
Lunch?  It's still noon.

16:37.210 --> 16:39.279
Shouldn't that be more
of a brunch for her?

16:40.210 --> 16:42.169
She was up before dawn, working out.

16:43.210 --> 16:47.779
So she went to lunch and just left you
here to rummage through her things?

16:49.809 --> 16:50.889
No.

16:51.610 --> 16:54.559
I told her I'm a vampire.
Daytime patio dining is out.

16:55.210 --> 16:56.580
Did you just make a joke?

16:58.210 --> 16:59.440
I really told her.

17:00.610 --> 17:04.440
Wow.  So do you think she'd
still set me up with her manager?

17:12.608 --> 17:15.309
- You look terrific.
- They canceled, didn't they?

17:19.809 --> 17:22.759
Just postponed.
Scheduling conflicts.  It's nothing.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.900
- Oliver, you said I had this part.
- Yes.

17:26.410 --> 17:28.970
They want you to come into
their offices and read.

17:30.609 --> 17:31.869
Read?

17:33.009 --> 17:35.430
Know how long it's been since
I've read for anything?

17:36.009 --> 17:40.400
A season and a half off the air
and suddenly I'm nobody again.

17:42.009 --> 17:44.400
- Not according to these.
- According to those...

17:45.009 --> 17:47.079
...I slept with Ernest Borgnine
and I'm bulimic.

17:48.009 --> 17:49.829
I hear Borgnine's
a very skilled lover.

17:50.410 --> 17:53.009
Listen to me.
Poor little rich girl.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.980
- We've all got problems.
- Yeah, well...

17:59.410 --> 18:02.430
...right now my problem is getting
this guy off my back...

18:03.009 --> 18:04.450
...long enough to win this part.

18:05.410 --> 18:09.200
I've been so distracted lately,
I haven't had time to play the game.

18:09.609 --> 18:10.980
Now I'm afraid I'm losing.

18:17.410 --> 18:20.319
- Here you are, Miss Lowell.
- Thank you, Maria.

18:25.809 --> 18:27.279
You're what, a 44 long?

18:28.210 --> 18:29.960
- Why?
- I have a premiere tonight.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.349
Can't go without my bodyguard, can I?

18:44.369 --> 18:46.299
Raven!  Raven!

18:47.970 --> 18:50.180
Raven!  Raven, over here!

18:53.970 --> 18:57.339
Raven.  They think that
I'm the character I play.

19:23.970 --> 19:25.579
The movie's in the alleyway?

19:26.369 --> 19:28.720
No, I just come to these
things for the photo-op.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.950
My driver meets me out back.

19:31.769 --> 19:35.349
If I had to sit through every one
of these, boredom would kill me.

19:40.769 --> 19:41.930
Rebecca, get down!

20:00.569 --> 20:01.440
Rebecca....

20:02.970 --> 20:04.900
It's okay.  I'm here.

20:12.569 --> 20:15.240
--any notes I got
if you want to compare them.

20:16.170 --> 20:18.910
I just want to go over your
statement one more time, sir.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.230
Rebecca.

20:23.369 --> 20:27.089
Not again.  Are you all right?
I came as soon as I heard.

20:27.569 --> 20:31.009
- And when was that, exactly?
- What do you mean?

20:32.970 --> 20:35.569
I know the stalker.  I've seen him.

20:35.970 --> 20:37.339
At your house.

20:38.369 --> 20:41.559
He's a stuntman.
You used to represent him.

20:43.170 --> 20:45.339
Oh, I didn't get a good look.

20:46.170 --> 20:49.680
Oh, come on, Oliver.  My private phone
number, how to get into my house...

20:50.369 --> 20:54.269
...that I skipped the movie at a
premiere.  Only you know all that.

20:56.970 --> 20:59.640
I never would have let you get hurt.
You must believe that.

21:01.769 --> 21:05.069
The publicity might help you get
the series.  I did it out of love.

21:05.970 --> 21:08.250
I don't pay you to love me.

21:09.569 --> 21:12.309
No.  That you get for free.

21:16.170 --> 21:17.680
I didn't get the part, did I?

21:19.769 --> 21:21.519
I was gonna tell you tonight.

21:23.369 --> 21:26.630
The network feels that
you're too "mature" for the role.

21:26.970 --> 21:30.759
It may not seem that way now, but
once we distance you from Raven--

21:31.769 --> 21:35.700
Oliver, the series is in syndication.
She'll always be there.

21:36.569 --> 21:39.519
- Beck--
- Looking younger than me forever.

21:40.170 --> 21:43.259
Sweetie, your life is not over at 24.

21:43.769 --> 21:45.630
I'm not 24!  I'm--

21:47.369 --> 21:50.990
Raven is 22.  She will always be 22.

21:51.569 --> 21:54.940
All right, so she'll always be 22.
She's not you.

21:56.369 --> 22:00.160
And we're gonna have to face it
that nobody stays young forever.

22:15.769 --> 22:19.180
I got the preliminary forensics report
from the theater.

22:19.369 --> 22:20.599
- The bullets were--
- Blanks.

22:21.170 --> 22:22.400
No, they were blanks.

22:24.170 --> 22:28.450
The shots never connected.  There were
no holes in the wall, nothing.

22:28.970 --> 22:32.480
- When does a killer use blanks?
- When he's not a killer.  It's fake.

22:34.369 --> 22:35.380
Miss Lowell?

22:35.569 --> 22:37.990
I don't think she knows.
How do I tell her?

22:39.170 --> 22:40.539
This is good news, isn't it?

22:40.970 --> 22:45.180
Depends on what would bother her more:
being stalked or not being stalked.

22:46.970 --> 22:49.670
- Actresses.
- Tell me about it.

22:49.970 --> 22:52.950
Thanks for coming.
I'm glad you could find the time.

22:55.369 --> 22:57.259
You were being serious?

22:57.769 --> 23:01.839
Big important stars ask me to lunch
and a shopping spree all the time...

23:02.569 --> 23:03.829
...in my dreams!

23:04.369 --> 23:06.329
I'm just an actress, like you.

23:06.769 --> 23:10.069
You're an actress, I'm someone
who auditions and auditions....

23:10.970 --> 23:15.390
That's how it is when you first start
out.  I'm sure you'll make it big.

23:18.170 --> 23:21.470
Sorry, I didn't mean
to squeal like that in public.

23:22.369 --> 23:26.650
Thank you for calling.  You must have
a ton of friends you could've asked.

23:27.170 --> 23:30.609
None of them would know what
to buy a 200-year-old vampire...

23:31.369 --> 23:32.630
...as a thank-you gift.

23:33.170 --> 23:36.220
He is impossible to buy for.
What on earth does he need?

23:36.769 --> 23:41.269
So, what's his story, anyway?
How did he become what he is?

23:42.170 --> 23:44.559
- Oh, God.  You got eight hours?
- I've got all day.

23:48.170 --> 23:49.430
I won't do that again.

23:57.890 --> 23:59.569
I was just coming to see you.

24:01.490 --> 24:05.559
There was no one upstairs so I just
came down.  I hope that's okay.

24:06.890 --> 24:08.220
Sure, come on in.

24:11.690 --> 24:14.500
I went shopping
to pick out a thank-you gift...

24:15.289 --> 24:18.200
...but what do you get the guy
who's seen everything?

24:18.890 --> 24:21.210
So I figured,
what's better than Dom?

24:23.089 --> 24:27.089
- You can--  You do--
- I can drink other liquids, yeah.

24:29.089 --> 24:31.259
Good.  Have you got glasses?

24:32.089 --> 24:35.809
Yeah.  Yeah.  Please sit down.

24:48.289 --> 24:51.869
Wow!  It's sort of what
you'd expect...

24:52.490 --> 24:54.099
...and sort of not.

24:56.089 --> 24:58.339
Well, there's no coffin.

24:59.089 --> 25:00.910
That hadn't even crossed my mind.

25:02.690 --> 25:03.670
Rebecca....

25:07.490 --> 25:10.440
There's something I have to tell you.
Your stalker--

25:11.089 --> 25:13.930
Oh, that.  I already know.

25:14.089 --> 25:15.170
You do?

25:16.490 --> 25:18.740
It turns out we share representation.

25:20.089 --> 25:22.089
- Oliver.
- Set the whole thing up...

25:22.490 --> 25:26.180
...to revive my flagging career.

25:27.289 --> 25:30.380
It didn't work.
I didn't get the part.

25:32.089 --> 25:33.319
I'm sorry.

25:35.089 --> 25:36.170
Yeah.

25:50.089 --> 25:52.829
Have you ever....
Oh, this is so dumb!

25:53.089 --> 25:54.880
Have you ever...

25:55.490 --> 25:58.329
...done that thing where you link arms
and sip champagne?

25:59.089 --> 26:01.299
It's sort of a good-luck thing.

26:20.089 --> 26:22.829
- Your shirt!  I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

26:23.690 --> 26:25.369
It's kind of fun.  Cold...

26:26.690 --> 26:27.880
...but fun.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.680
I'll be right back.

26:48.289 --> 26:52.750
You know, the next time
I try something so corny...

26:53.690 --> 26:56.599
...I promise not to ruin your wardrobe
in the process.

27:05.089 --> 27:06.599
Let's try this again.

27:14.690 --> 27:16.019
A toast:

27:16.490 --> 27:20.559
To the end of an ending
and the beginning of a beginning.

27:35.490 --> 27:36.650
Oh, Wesley!

27:37.289 --> 27:39.430
I got your pages.  What's happening?

27:40.289 --> 27:42.500
I may have done something terrible.

27:45.089 --> 27:47.410
- I went shopping with Rebecca.
- That's terrible?

27:48.089 --> 27:51.250
No!  That was fantastic.
They close off stores for her.

27:51.690 --> 27:53.089
Oh, and lunch at Mirabelle.

27:53.490 --> 27:56.970
I had a to-die-for veal fillet
with a light truffle marinade--

27:57.690 --> 27:58.809
- Cordelia.
- Oh, sorry.

27:59.490 --> 28:03.769
The whole time Rebecca's real gabby,
asking questions about Angel.

28:04.890 --> 28:06.960
Well, what sorts of questions?

28:07.289 --> 28:10.730
Where does Angel hail from,
what's his favorite color...

28:11.490 --> 28:16.059
...the specific details on how one
could make herself into a vampire....

28:18.089 --> 28:20.650
- Surely you don't think--
- What?

28:21.089 --> 28:24.779
That she'd try to maneuver Angel
into an exchange of bodily fluids...

28:25.890 --> 28:28.980
...to keep herself young,
thus saving her career?

28:30.690 --> 28:34.759
I used to be....
A long time ago....

28:35.490 --> 28:37.240
I hurt a lot of people.

28:39.089 --> 28:40.809
- I don't believe that.
- No.

28:41.490 --> 28:43.839
It's true.  I was bad.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.980
Which is why
I have to help people now.

28:47.490 --> 28:48.859
I'm trying to atone.

28:49.289 --> 28:51.539
Cordelia says you've saved the world.

28:52.289 --> 28:53.900
A couple times I helped.

28:57.690 --> 29:00.319
But I almost had it sucked
into hell once too.

29:03.089 --> 29:06.180
Still, don't you think...

29:06.690 --> 29:10.309
...after all this time,
you deserve some happiness?

29:12.690 --> 29:14.789
That's probably not a good idea.

29:19.289 --> 29:22.549
You smell...so good.

29:27.089 --> 29:28.630
So warm.

29:34.890 --> 29:35.940
I miss that.

29:39.089 --> 29:40.250
You don't have to.

29:40.890 --> 29:45.170
You can have what you've been craving
all these long, empty years.

29:47.490 --> 29:50.089
We both can. Forever.

29:52.890 --> 29:54.079
What are you saying?

29:58.890 --> 30:00.329
You know what I'm saying.

30:04.289 --> 30:05.619
Do it.

30:06.690 --> 30:09.500
We won't have to be lonely,
either of us, ever again.

30:10.890 --> 30:13.059
You don't know what you're asking me.

30:13.289 --> 30:17.609
Of course I know.  I'm not a fool.
There's a price.  I understand that.

30:18.690 --> 30:20.440
You couldn't possibly understand.

30:20.490 --> 30:24.109
I wasn't afraid when I looked
into the mirror and you weren't there.

30:25.289 --> 30:28.130
I didn't scream.  I didn't run.
I understood.

30:28.890 --> 30:33.000
No, you weren't afraid.  You looked
into that mirror and saw yourself.

30:33.690 --> 30:36.009
That's all you ever see.
That's what scares you.

30:36.690 --> 30:39.670
This isn't about the way the studio
or your fans see you.

30:40.289 --> 30:41.759
It's about how you see yourself.

30:42.089 --> 30:45.180
Your reflection has been corrupted
into something unrecognizable.

30:45.690 --> 30:47.440
You want it to stay the same?

30:49.289 --> 30:51.680
What you really want
is to make it disappear.

30:54.089 --> 30:56.119
You're supposed to help people.

30:58.289 --> 30:59.660
Help me.

31:00.089 --> 31:01.529
You want me to help you?

31:02.490 --> 31:03.750
Fine.

31:04.890 --> 31:07.309
- What are you doing?
- It's a big decision, eternity.

31:08.490 --> 31:10.809
You need a taste of what
you're asking for.

31:19.289 --> 31:20.660
I'm sorry.

31:26.490 --> 31:27.750
What did you do to me?

31:28.890 --> 31:30.220
Nothing.

31:33.089 --> 31:34.599
You put something in my drink.

31:36.089 --> 31:39.529
I wanted you to relax a little.
Lower the defenses a little.

31:40.289 --> 31:42.539
- What was it?
- Just a little happy pill.

31:46.289 --> 31:47.660
Oh, God.

31:48.690 --> 31:52.450
- I'm so sorry.
- Everybody's so sorry.

31:54.690 --> 31:58.019
- I just wanted us both to be happy.
- But I am happy.

31:58.289 --> 31:59.660
- You are?
- Yes.

32:06.089 --> 32:07.460
Perfectly happy.

32:13.450 --> 32:14.680
Angel?

32:14.650 --> 32:16.049
You look a little nervous.

32:16.450 --> 32:17.680
You....

32:18.849 --> 32:20.569
- You're--
- Free!

32:24.250 --> 32:25.690
You freed me.

32:30.250 --> 32:32.950
God, I love this stuff.  Wow!

32:33.250 --> 32:35.990
Let me get the name
of your dealer before I kill you.

32:38.650 --> 32:40.750
- Kill me?
- In all my years...

32:41.049 --> 32:42.730
...I never killed a famous person.

32:43.450 --> 32:45.410
With no witnesses, who'll believe me?

32:46.450 --> 32:48.410
Maybe we can take a picture.

32:48.849 --> 32:51.869
I know!  We'll do it like
we did back in the day.

32:53.049 --> 32:56.670
I'll keep your head on a stick
as proof.

32:58.450 --> 32:59.390
My head on a stick?

32:59.650 --> 33:01.440
Well, okay...

33:03.250 --> 33:04.299
...pike.

33:05.049 --> 33:06.940
- You're trying to scare me.
- Is it working?

33:07.450 --> 33:08.640
No.

33:11.049 --> 33:12.349
How about now?

33:16.450 --> 33:19.430
- You're crazy.
- No.  I'm a vampire.

33:22.450 --> 33:25.009
You could drop a few pounds.
I'll help you.

33:27.250 --> 33:28.299
This isn't you.

33:28.450 --> 33:32.380
They always mistake me for the
character, never see the real me.

33:35.650 --> 33:36.730
I just wanted to--

33:37.450 --> 33:39.839
Be like me?
Hey, I'm one happy fella.

33:43.450 --> 33:45.910
I'll torture you
for a few long hours...

33:46.450 --> 33:49.289
...then you can tell me
if this is the lifestyle for you.

33:54.849 --> 33:56.079
Up to you.

34:14.050 --> 34:15.590
Whatever you're going to do...

34:17.650 --> 34:18.630
...do it.

34:20.050 --> 34:21.380
I'm not running anymore.

34:24.250 --> 34:25.900
Now, that I respect!

34:30.250 --> 34:31.440
Women!

34:52.690 --> 34:53.920
It's okay.

34:56.889 --> 34:58.219
Thank God!

35:01.090 --> 35:03.230
Help me.  He's trying to kill me.

35:03.489 --> 35:04.679
You slut!

35:06.489 --> 35:08.559
- You did it with him, didn't you?
- Cordelia.

35:08.889 --> 35:11.139
- What are you talking about?
- What you did.

35:11.889 --> 35:14.380
- I didn't do anything.
- You must have done something.

35:16.690 --> 35:19.460
Maybe I gave him something
to loosen him up.  Now he's--

35:19.690 --> 35:21.829
- Loose?
- Yeah.

35:22.690 --> 35:24.090
- What was it?
- Does it matter?

35:24.489 --> 35:26.420
If he's homicidal, I think, yeah!

35:26.889 --> 35:28.400
- Doximall.
- Doximall!

35:28.690 --> 35:31.670
- Doxi-what?
- Powerful tranquilizer.  Induces bliss.

35:32.889 --> 35:34.500
Bliss?  As in bliss?

35:34.690 --> 35:37.500
Sheer contentment?
Perfect happiness?

35:38.289 --> 35:41.130
- It's synthetic.  Not true happiness.
- This is good.

35:41.889 --> 35:44.380
He hasn't really turned.
It's an illusion.

35:44.889 --> 35:46.260
He bit me.

35:46.690 --> 35:49.570
We'll leave the premises
until the effects wear off.

35:50.289 --> 35:52.849
- Are you sure they will wear off?
- Reasonably.

35:54.489 --> 35:56.000
He's cut the power.

35:56.889 --> 35:58.960
- Where's the box?
- Side of the building.

35:59.289 --> 36:01.039
- He's gone out.
- Which means he's--

36:01.690 --> 36:04.250
Looks like somebody
didn't pay the power bill.

36:07.690 --> 36:08.949
Cordelia?

36:09.489 --> 36:12.090
I'd lay odds that the phone's
dead too.

36:13.090 --> 36:14.139
What do you think?

36:16.090 --> 36:19.349
- What happens if there's an emergency?
- Angel.

36:20.289 --> 36:24.329
I want you to listen to me.
What you're experiencing isn't real.

36:25.090 --> 36:27.550
You've been fed a drug.
It's simulating bliss.

36:28.690 --> 36:31.389
All that you're feeling
is chemical suggestion.

36:34.690 --> 36:35.849
Angel?

36:41.289 --> 36:42.480
Name's Angelus.

36:44.889 --> 36:48.820
I don't wish to take drastic measures,
but unless you listen, I warn you--

36:49.690 --> 36:52.639
You're warning me?
What happened, Wes?

36:54.489 --> 36:56.099
You suddenly grow a pair?

36:56.889 --> 36:59.909
That's it.  The whole root
of your inferiority complex.

37:01.090 --> 37:05.340
Good news, Wes, old boy.  You don't
really have an inferiority complex.

37:05.889 --> 37:07.750
You're just simply inferior.

37:10.090 --> 37:11.320
Wesley, no!

37:16.090 --> 37:18.300
- Why don't you just--
- Just-- Just--

37:20.289 --> 37:21.550
Line?!

37:22.690 --> 37:25.079
"Of course a time will come...

37:25.690 --> 37:29.519
...when Torvald is not
as devoted to me."

37:31.690 --> 37:34.289
You were really, let me tell you, bad.

37:34.690 --> 37:36.130
- Stop it.
- Why?

37:36.489 --> 37:39.900
You didn't.  I've been to hell,
but that was so much worse!

37:43.090 --> 37:44.070
You had to be there.

37:44.289 --> 37:47.769
There wasn't a dry eye in the house.
Everybody was laughing.

37:48.489 --> 37:51.750
Here's a thought:  Maybe you can
get Raven to coach you.

37:52.090 --> 37:54.119
Then you'd actually suck.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.150
- Back off.
- What are you gonna do?

37:58.690 --> 38:01.250
- Melt me?
- One more step and you'll find out.

38:01.690 --> 38:03.719
You think this is just water?

38:07.090 --> 38:08.769
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

38:09.489 --> 38:12.119
You don't think I was ready
for this, do you?

38:12.489 --> 38:16.000
Why do I have a stake stashed in my
desk, a cross in my bag?

38:16.690 --> 38:20.269
I think about this happening
every single day.

38:22.690 --> 38:24.269
That's just drinking water.

38:25.090 --> 38:26.840
Delivered right to our door...

38:26.889 --> 38:29.489
...then blessed every second
Tuesday by Father Mackie...

38:30.489 --> 38:33.969
...while you're down in your cave
sleeping through the day.

38:36.489 --> 38:37.750
You don't believe me?

38:39.489 --> 38:40.679
Have some!

38:43.690 --> 38:45.510
And the Oscar goes to....

39:14.809 --> 39:15.969
Are you still evil?

39:22.010 --> 39:24.960
- I'm so sorry.
- Can you read that line again?

39:28.010 --> 39:29.659
- Rebecca? Is she--?
- Gone.

39:30.409 --> 39:33.570
She won't be keeping you on retainer
as her bodyguard.

39:34.010 --> 39:37.309
I think it was the trying
to murder her that lost the gig.

39:38.809 --> 39:40.949
- I need to apologize.
- There's no need.

39:41.809 --> 39:44.929
- Hello?
- It was the drug.  Couldn't be helped.

39:47.809 --> 39:50.090
Things were said, that's true...

39:50.809 --> 39:53.369
...but I think it best if we
put it behind us.

39:55.010 --> 39:56.019
Move on.

39:59.210 --> 40:00.260
Thank you.

40:03.409 --> 40:05.269
You walk a fine line, Angel.

40:07.010 --> 40:08.130
I don't envy you.

40:13.610 --> 40:14.940
Wesley?

40:16.610 --> 40:17.909
Nice moves up there.

40:25.010 --> 40:26.380
- Cordelia--
- Okay.

40:26.809 --> 40:30.530
Here's something I never
thought I would say to you:

40:31.010 --> 40:32.519
Wesley's right.

40:34.010 --> 40:35.550
- Forget it.
- I didn't mean--

40:35.809 --> 40:39.389
Yes, you did.  I'd appreciate you
not trying to weasel out of it.

40:43.010 --> 40:46.909
Angelus may not be relaxing company,
but at least he's honest.

40:49.010 --> 40:51.750
Shouldn't I expect the same
from the not-evil version?

40:53.210 --> 40:54.889
So we're okay, then?

40:56.809 --> 41:00.320
I'm too big of a person to let it
get in the way of our friendship.

41:01.610 --> 41:03.190
I appreciate that.

41:07.610 --> 41:09.429
You're not gonna untie me, are you?

41:16.010 --> 41:17.239
Wesley?

41:17.809 --> 41:18.860
Cordelia?

41:20.409 --> 41:21.349
Guys?
