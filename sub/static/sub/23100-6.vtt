A hush falls over the crowd

01:18.083 --> 01:22.791
as Geronimo Jay attempts
his greatest trick ever,

01:22.916 --> 01:26.166
the double reverse,
triple backward somersault spin!

01:26.291 --> 01:27.833
And here he goes.

01:27.958 --> 01:30.583
Some have called it impossible,

01:30.708 --> 01:33.750
but everything is possible, folks.

01:33.875 --> 01:36.625
Geronim-- Whoa!

01:43.291 --> 01:46.708
Whoa.

01:50.166 --> 01:53.708
Woo-hoo! He's done it!
Did you see that, bugs?

01:53.875 --> 01:56.625
Buzz? Uh, Kumi?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.833
Hey, bugs, did anyone see that?

01:58.958 --> 02:00.250
-Who?
-Whoa!

02:01.708 --> 02:04.166
Hey, hey, hey, Tawny.
I didn't see you there.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.500
Hey, have you seen Buzz?

02:07.583 --> 02:09.208
Mm...

02:09.500 --> 02:10.750
Who?

02:10.875 --> 02:13.833
Okay. Have you seen Kumi?

02:14.708 --> 02:16.000
Who?

02:16.083 --> 02:18.250
Um, uh... What about Walter?

02:18.333 --> 02:20.708
Ah. Mm...

02:20.875 --> 02:22.500
Yeah, no. Who?

02:22.625 --> 02:25.166
Okay. Crick?

02:25.291 --> 02:27.916
Oh, yeah. He, uh-- Who?

02:34.333 --> 02:37.250
The Big House.

02:37.375 --> 02:40.208
I wonder who lives there.

02:40.291 --> 02:41.541
Hmm.

02:41.666 --> 02:44.791
-No one knows for sure.
-Huh?

02:44.875 --> 02:48.916
We've only ever seen them from a distance,
and they've never seen us.

02:49.583 --> 02:52.916
What would they look like, up close?
I want to see.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.875
Mm... That's not possible.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.458
What? Everything is possible.

02:58.541 --> 03:02.208
Mm, you have to be very careful
if you go near the Big House.

03:02.333 --> 03:03.583
No, I don't.

03:03.708 --> 03:06.500
I don't have to be careful of anything.

03:12.875 --> 03:15.250
Jay? Jay?

03:15.375 --> 03:18.250
Oh, my goodness gracious, where is he?

03:18.333 --> 03:22.500
Uh... By my crick-to-calculations,
he can't have gone far.

03:22.625 --> 03:24.000
Who?

03:24.666 --> 03:26.833
Oh, Tawny. It's you.

03:26.916 --> 03:28.166
Uh, have you seen Jay?

03:28.250 --> 03:34.166
Uh, yeah.
He went to find out who lives, um...

03:34.583 --> 03:36.583
in the...

03:37.000 --> 03:38.166
The Big House.

03:39.333 --> 03:40.708
the Big House?

03:40.833 --> 03:42.750
Not the Big House.

03:42.875 --> 03:44.666
All by himself?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.583
Whoa.

03:54.166 --> 03:57.125
See, there's no need to be--

03:57.750 --> 03:59.083
Careful!

04:09.125 --> 04:12.125
Like I said, no need to be careful.

04:33.083 --> 04:34.125
Huh?

04:40.500 --> 04:41.541
Hello?

04:42.125 --> 04:45.083
Wow, hello.

04:45.166 --> 04:46.916
Julia! Lunch is ready.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.166

04:53.291 --> 04:54.583
I'm-- I'm right here!

04:54.666 --> 04:56.541
Little bug, come back.

04:56.625 --> 05:00.083
I'm here! Hey! Hey!

05:04.791 --> 05:06.250
Wow.

05:06.750 --> 05:09.583
Wait till I tell the others.

05:12.666 --> 05:14.208
Are we there yet?

05:14.833 --> 05:16.583
Please say yes.

05:16.708 --> 05:19.166
- Walter, we only just left.
- Bugs!

05:20.750 --> 05:23.916
-Jay! It's you!
-Are you okay?

05:24.041 --> 05:26.791
Bugs, I've just-- I saw...

05:26.916 --> 05:29.166
Oh, you'll never guess...

- Who are you talking about?
- I've seen who lives in the Big House.

06:34.875 --> 06:38.250
Up close. I've seen her face.

06:38.333 --> 06:42.333
We were worried, Jay.
The Big House is a dangerous place.

06:42.458 --> 06:45.083
No, it's like a magic castle

06:45.208 --> 06:48.375
with a giant princess
who comes down from the sky,

06:48.500 --> 06:50.416
and her face is kind

06:50.541 --> 06:53.916
with a spotty nose and one ginormous eye.

06:54.041 --> 06:58.875
She's-- She's just like us,
only ginormous.

06:58.958 --> 07:01.916
Jay, is this one of your jokes?

07:02.041 --> 07:04.500
No. I'm telling the truth.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.208
Crick, you believe me, don't you?

07:07.291 --> 07:10.625
Uh, well, it does seem like a nice story.

07:10.708 --> 07:15.291
It just, uh... It doesn't seem
like a story that is, uh...

07:15.458 --> 07:17.625
well, real.

07:19.875 --> 07:24.541
But, uh, I suppose, the only way
to find out the truth

07:24.666 --> 07:27.375
is by gathering evidence.

07:29.166 --> 07:31.666
It was like a looking device.

07:31.791 --> 07:34.708
I think we need one to see her up close.

07:34.791 --> 07:35.958
Intriguing.

07:36.083 --> 07:39.125
Uh, can you describe
the technical specifications?

07:41.416 --> 07:42.583
What did it look like?

07:42.666 --> 07:45.583
Oh! Uh... Well, it was round.

07:51.791 --> 07:53.291
Huh?

08:00.541 --> 08:01.666
Ah.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.208
Awesome!

08:05.333 --> 08:12.083
No, like a round piece of solid air
for looking through?

08:25.583 --> 08:30.500
Yeah, yeah! With a straight bit
of, uh, non-air for holding.

08:30.583 --> 08:32.291
Whoo!

08:43.416 --> 08:44.750
That's it!

08:44.875 --> 08:47.416
I can't wait for you bugs to meet her.

08:51.291 --> 08:53.958
Here, deep in the forest of grass,

08:54.083 --> 08:59.333
the brave explorers search
for the mysterious face.

09:00.458 --> 09:05.333
The forest falls eerily quiet,
as the brave explorers...

09:08.833 --> 09:12.583
-Buzz?
-You guys look funny.

09:12.708 --> 09:14.875
You look funny.

09:14.958 --> 09:17.750
I look funny.

09:20.583 --> 09:24.833
Perhaps here,
at this great historical monument,

09:24.958 --> 09:31.125
the elusive face
will show its, uh... face.

09:31.250 --> 09:33.291
Can anyone see a face?

09:34.583 --> 09:38.291
I can see your face
but not what's-her-face's face.

09:41.166 --> 09:42.708
I'm detecting, uh...

09:43.166 --> 09:45.875
no trace, no trace of the face.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.083
I know where we have to go.

09:56.750 --> 10:00.625
And as the sun sets,
the exhausted explorers

10:00.750 --> 10:03.250
realize that some of them are slugs

10:03.375 --> 10:05.416
and don't even have proper legs.

10:05.541 --> 10:09.666
Jay, thanks for the day
of exploring, but, uh...

10:09.791 --> 10:11.583
maybe we should quit
while we're ahead.

10:11.708 --> 10:15.125
Yes, we should definitely quit
while we have heads.

10:15.833 --> 10:19.250
We can't quit now.
You haven't even seen her face yet.

10:19.375 --> 10:20.666
Jay, it's okay.

10:20.791 --> 10:23.458
We've had fun and I liked your story.

10:23.583 --> 10:25.250
My story?

10:25.375 --> 10:27.625
Crick, you believe me, don't you?

10:27.916 --> 10:32.708
Uh... Well, maybe it was just a daydream?

10:33.791 --> 10:36.000
Maybe you're right.

10:36.500 --> 10:40.458
Maybe not everything
is possible after all.

10:47.375 --> 10:49.750
Julia, did you bring your book inside?

10:50.833 --> 10:51.791
What's that?

10:59.833 --> 11:02.041
I knew I'd seen her face.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.083

12:07.250 --> 12:08.958
Really?

12:09.083 --> 12:11.666
Well, that's a wonderful story, Julia.

12:44.791 --> 12:46.291
Huh.

12:51.208 --> 12:53.125
Who's making all that noise?

12:53.250 --> 12:54.625
How do you know that is a who?

12:54.750 --> 12:56.708
-It could be a what.
-Or a how.

12:56.833 --> 12:58.083
Or a why.

12:58.208 --> 13:01.083
There's only one way to find out.

13:01.208 --> 13:03.041
Yeah! Let's go!

13:20.000 --> 13:21.375
Wha--?

13:22.250 --> 13:24.708
What is that?

13:36.666 --> 13:39.291
Well, hello, hello.

13:39.416 --> 13:41.958
And a good, good, goody-good day to you.

13:42.041 --> 13:44.041
Oh. Hi.

13:44.166 --> 13:45.500
You're not that scary.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.166
Why, heh, thank you. How kind.

13:49.291 --> 13:54.666
And a good, good, goody-good day
to all of you too, friends.

13:54.833 --> 13:58.500
Jasper's the name
and hop, hop, hopping's the game.

14:00.125 --> 14:02.833
Is he going to eat us?

14:03.250 --> 14:06.166
Oh! Eat you? Heh. No.

14:06.291 --> 14:09.250
At least not until
you've answered my invitation...

14:10.125 --> 14:14.583
to hop on board
this luxurious viewing vehicle

14:14.708 --> 14:21.333

14:21.458 --> 14:23.666

astound and amaze.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.958

14:40.125 --> 14:44.666
Well, I would love to detail
all the little details,

14:44.750 --> 14:50.208
but the very special thing
about the Magical Mystery Tour is...

14:50.333 --> 14:53.916

14:54.041 --> 14:57.875

to see the world.

17:09.833 --> 17:11.040
Let's do this.

17:13.375 --> 17:14.415
Brace yourselves.

17:14.540 --> 17:18.790
The Magical Mystery Tour
is about to begin...

17:23.415 --> 17:25.083
any moment now.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.291
Heh. In any moment.

17:38.833 --> 17:41.500
Heh. Look, this is...

17:41.625 --> 17:43.791
Well, she's always here by now.

17:43.916 --> 17:47.833
Who is... she?

18:00.958 --> 18:05.583
Wow. I can see you in there.

18:05.708 --> 18:07.500
What do we do? What do we do?

18:08.125 --> 18:11.708
Welcome aboard, bold travelers.

18:11.833 --> 18:14.375
Now, here below us,
you will see the first

18:14.500 --> 18:19.708
of many astonishing sights
that await us on the tour.

18:19.791 --> 18:25.208
There, the legendary
Palace of... Smorfy Dorf!

18:25.291 --> 18:28.083
Huh. Looks a lot like my house.

18:33.666 --> 18:35.250
What's that, Jasper?

18:35.333 --> 18:37.333
Oh! Ha, ha. Well...

18:37.458 --> 18:42.875
that is the Magical Forest of, uh...

18:43.291 --> 18:45.750
Bendy Wendy Trees.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.666
Oh, yes, it's a personal favorite of mine.

18:48.791 --> 18:51.000
They look remarkably similar to...

18:51.083 --> 18:53.916
uh, the trees in our village.

18:54.041 --> 18:55.541
Hey, come on, would you quit it?

18:55.666 --> 18:57.583
I'm trying to enjoy the tour.

18:57.666 --> 19:01.333
- Jasper?
- Uh, thank you.

19:01.416 --> 19:03.458
Now, look at this.

19:03.583 --> 19:07.666
The lost city of, uh... Lost-ville.

19:07.791 --> 19:09.250
Takes my breath away.

19:09.375 --> 19:13.583
Oh, and you certainly won't want
to miss the stupendous sight of--

19:25.291 --> 19:27.583
-What do you call this place, Jasper?
-Uh...

19:28.166 --> 19:30.666
Well, um, this is...

19:30.791 --> 19:34.166
This is none other than the, um... The...

19:38.750 --> 19:41.375
- Julia, we're late.
- Oh, I'm coming, Mom.

19:45.458 --> 19:47.833
What was that?

19:58.416 --> 20:01.750
Finally, we can see where we are.

20:01.875 --> 20:04.541
And it's not good.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.000
Whoa. What do you call that, Jasper?

20:12.125 --> 20:13.791
Jasper?

20:15.833 --> 20:19.458
It's, heh... It's a mystery.

20:19.958 --> 20:22.333
What do you mean, it's a mystery?

20:22.416 --> 20:24.833
Heh. What I mean is, it's a...

20:24.958 --> 20:28.583
It's very mysterious.

20:28.708 --> 20:31.750
What does "mysterious" mean?

20:31.875 --> 20:33.541
Well, I'll tell you what it means.

20:33.666 --> 20:38.083
It means I've never been
on the Magical Mystery Tour!

20:39.583 --> 20:41.458
So, where is we going next?

20:55.958 --> 20:58.208
Hey, little bugs.

20:59.041 --> 21:02.541
With your help,
maybe I could win the science fair.

21:02.666 --> 21:05.083
We need a way out of here, fast.

21:05.208 --> 21:08.583
- Why? She would never hurt us.
- Ew. Bugs.

21:12.791 --> 21:15.291
- Denis.
- Sorry.

21:16.333 --> 21:18.333
But it can't hurt to have a back-up plan.

21:20.458 --> 21:24.125
How about a crick-up plan?

21:24.958 --> 21:26.625
A little to the left. A little more.

21:30.500 --> 21:32.875
Awesome. Now what?

21:32.958 --> 21:37.291
Huh. Interspecies co-operation.
I've never seen anything like it.

21:38.708 --> 21:40.375
Astonishing stuff, Julia.

21:45.583 --> 21:51.333
It, uh... seems we've been rewarded
for our, uh... endeavors.

21:51.458 --> 21:53.750
Awesome! What do we win?

22:01.375 --> 22:04.791
This is a terrible prize.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.500
Bye-bye, bugs.

22:23.250 --> 22:25.916
We... We made it.

22:27.833 --> 22:28.958
Jasper, wait!

22:30.833 --> 22:34.208
Before you say anything rash,

22:34.333 --> 22:37.208
I must offer you my humble apologies.

22:37.333 --> 22:40.916
If I had any idea
the tour would be like that,

22:41.041 --> 22:44.458
I never ever would
have invited you, I promise.

22:44.583 --> 22:46.500
But everything was just like you said.

22:46.625 --> 22:48.125
It was magical.

22:48.250 --> 22:50.500
-And mysterious.
-And tour-like!

22:50.625 --> 22:53.375
And-- And-- And awesome!

22:53.500 --> 22:55.958
It was belly-rific!

22:56.083 --> 22:59.166
Well, all good then.

23:00.125 --> 23:02.708
In that case...

23:02.833 --> 23:06.791
have you heard about
the astonishing airborne adventure?

23:06.916 --> 23:09.416
It's due to leave any moment now.
What do you say?

23:13.083 --> 23:15.416
Jay, let's think about this for a minute.

23:15.541 --> 23:18.916
Bugs, it'll be fine.
