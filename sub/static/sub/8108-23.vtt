WEBVTT

00:01.836 --> 00:03.879
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)

00:25.985 --> 00:28.070
- It's way too fast.
- It felt good.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.156
If we can clear the stage,
quickly please.

00:30.281 --> 00:31.699
Maury, it's too fast.

00:31.824 --> 00:32.700
It's exactly the same.

00:32.950 --> 00:33.826
Then slow it down.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.161
Everything all right,
Jeremy?

00:35.286 --> 00:37.747
Sure. Ready
whenever you are.

00:37.872 --> 00:38.873
From the allegro please.

00:45.838 --> 00:47.006
What's his problem?

00:47.131 --> 00:48.716
His back's not 100%.

00:48.841 --> 00:50.468
He can't talk to
the conductor like that.

00:50.593 --> 00:52.261
No, he can't.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.221
She could.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.479
You okay with the lift?

01:01.604 --> 01:03.606
I'll be fine unless
you mess up the timing.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.448
My timing is perfect.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.492
Was last night.

01:17.953 --> 01:19.747
Moment of truth.

01:35.513 --> 01:36.764
(GROANING)

01:42.061 --> 01:43.521
Damn it.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.398
(GASPING)

01:46.816 --> 01:48.526
Penelope, are you
all right?

01:56.700 --> 01:59.328
She can't breathe.
Call the doctor!

02:46.250 --> 02:48.586
Are you gonna ignore me
all day again?

02:48.711 --> 02:49.795
I help you.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.755
You tried to kill Chase.

02:51.881 --> 02:54.175
Doing what you wanted,
that's all, boss.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.722
- I exist.
- No, you don't.

03:00.806 --> 03:03.726
I acknowledge my
subconscious exists. Now go away.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.227
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

03:05.352 --> 03:08.689
Saying it is one thing.
Living it is another.

03:10.274 --> 03:14.862
You're not rational.
Not completely.

03:19.867 --> 03:20.910
Put the phone
on the receiver,

03:21.035 --> 03:22.453
send the hookers home
and get dressed.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.288
- We've got a case.
- I'm taking a personal day.

03:24.413 --> 03:27.082
21-year-old star of the New York Ballet
collapsed on stage.

03:27.208 --> 03:29.793
I love ballet.
But as someone may have mentioned,

03:29.919 --> 03:31.670
I'm taking a personal day.

03:31.795 --> 03:34.006
Cuddy said get your ass
in or you're fired.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.716
She's not going to fire me.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.177
She's not going to fire you?
If you don't go to work?

03:38.302 --> 03:39.845
- Okay.
- How long, do you figure,

03:39.970 --> 03:42.181
till I just disappear?

03:45.517 --> 03:46.936
Hold on.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.605
No tumors or punctures
in the lungs,

03:49.730 --> 03:52.858
no bruising,
no sign of trauma, no STDs.

03:52.983 --> 03:56.195
And supplemental oxygen's
only gotten her saturation level to 60.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.364
Lungs keep collapsing
despite a chest tube.

03:58.489 --> 03:59.740
ER ruled out the obvious,

03:59.865 --> 04:01.617
white count and temp
are normal, so no pneumonia.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.161
The coffee's burnt, Thirteen's wearing
cherry-flavored lip gloss.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.747
Foreman's staring at you.
Any of that helpful?

04:06.872 --> 04:08.082
House.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.211
- STD?
- We just said the tests were negative.

04:12.336 --> 04:13.379
- You think we should...
- No.

04:13.504 --> 04:16.715
She's a dancer.
What about dehydration?

04:16.840 --> 04:18.884
What about
a pulmonary contusion?

04:19.009 --> 04:21.220
CT showed no inflammation
on the lungs.

04:21.345 --> 04:23.305
What about dehydration?

04:25.641 --> 04:28.227
BUN and creatinine
are elevated but within range.

04:28.352 --> 04:31.939
Hey. I'm just
the irrational part of your brain,

04:32.064 --> 04:34.441
but elevated
means high, right?

04:34.984 --> 04:37.069
Dehydration could
hide an infection.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.115
Dehydration could
hide an infection.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.366
Go treat her for the obvious.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.910
IV fluids and
antibiotics for pneumonia.

04:49.081 --> 04:51.083
We're like
Magic and Kareem.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.171
Mr. Pietramala,
you have kidney cancer.

04:56.297 --> 05:00.301
Wow. Is that a bad one?
I mean, they're all bad, but...

05:01.885 --> 05:03.804
The door was closed
for a reason.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.932
Well, now it's open for a reason.
We need to talk.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.101
He just told me
I have kidney cancer.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.562
Then you'll obviously need
a moment to process.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.022
House.

05:14.732 --> 05:16.734
I'm hallucinating.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.530
I'm... I'll be right back.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.204
I need you to sit in
on my differentials,

05:29.330 --> 05:30.581
double-check everything I do.

05:30.706 --> 05:32.041
You can't treat patients...

05:32.166 --> 05:33.459
It's gotta be sleep apnea.

05:33.584 --> 05:35.627
I get a good night's sleep,
and I still feel exhausted.

05:35.753 --> 05:38.422
Lack of delta sleep
can lead to hallucinations.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.758
Do you have any other
neurological symptoms?

05:40.883 --> 05:41.759
Don't think so.

05:41.884 --> 05:42.718
- Aphasia?
- No.

05:43.010 --> 05:43.969
- Memory loss?
- No.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.804
- Irritability?
- Yeah, that one.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.306
Don't deflect.
He cares about you.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.224
- You shouldn't be practicing.
- You care about him. Tell him...

05:49.350 --> 05:50.768
- At least until...
- Enough.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.814
Don't give me the look.
I told you I was hallucinating.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.942
Who were you talking to?

05:59.068 --> 06:02.071
Someone who's not actually here,
beyond that seems irrelevant.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.865
Your mind made a choice.
It means something.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.159
AMBER: You know he's just
gonna keep asking.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.285
Kutner.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.624
Good choice.
He feels bad.

06:13.749 --> 06:14.875
You gonna help me or not?

06:16.960 --> 06:18.253
Yeah.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.717
I could eat from this place
seven days a week.

06:23.842 --> 06:26.470
We practically do.

06:26.595 --> 06:27.888
You can order
tomorrow night.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.766
- Do you want some wine?
- No, thanks.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.520
I have my husband's sperm.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.691
Your dead husband's?

06:39.817 --> 06:42.778
We froze it when
he got diagnosed.

06:42.903 --> 06:47.741
And you kept it?
All this time?

06:47.866 --> 06:50.911
I used to think,
if I didn't find anyone...

06:51.036 --> 06:52.121
You found someone.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.247
I know.

06:54.790 --> 06:57.042
- But...
- What if it goes wrong?

06:57.167 --> 07:00.421
What if I turn out to
be a radical anarchist

07:00.546 --> 07:03.882
with a secret family,
and that I age backwards?

07:05.843 --> 07:08.804
Nobody plans on
getting divorced.

07:08.929 --> 07:12.891
I didn't plan
on my husband dying. But he did.

07:14.685 --> 07:17.604
So, you're saying
you want a pre-nup?

07:19.440 --> 07:21.191
In liquid form?

07:21.817 --> 07:22.860
(SIGHS)

07:27.448 --> 07:29.658
What if it's not
sleep apnea?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.785
Trauma from your
motorcycle accident?

07:31.910 --> 07:34.788
Vicodin abuse?
You need to be admitted.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.665
I know you're wrong
about sleep apnea,

07:36.790 --> 07:38.792
which means you know you're wrong
about sleep apnea.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.878
You're scared.
Tell him you're scared.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.884
I can't sleep
with you here.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.761
(SIGHS)

08:03.358 --> 08:04.193
Did it work?

08:04.318 --> 08:06.904
Do you see someone
standing beside me?

08:07.029 --> 08:08.614
No.

08:08.739 --> 08:09.740
Then no.

08:09.865 --> 08:12.993
So what's next on your list of things
it's not?

08:13.118 --> 08:16.205
Patient's not responding
to the antibiotics. Still can't breathe.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.956
So run a test to confirm
it's pneumonia.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.626
We can't do a bronc
because her lungs are still collapsed.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.586
Transtracheal aspiration.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.630
That's basically
waterboarding.

08:24.755 --> 08:25.672
It is pretty radical.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.175
It's a great idea.

08:28.300 --> 08:32.804
Regular radical, me radical
or me-out-of-my-mind radical?

08:32.930 --> 08:35.807
Somewhere between
regular and you.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.101
So what's the problem?

08:38.227 --> 08:39.228
Everything okay?

08:40.187 --> 08:43.065
No. Our patient
can't breathe.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.652
Either do the test
or come up with a better one.

08:52.950 --> 08:55.202
So we're down to
infection, trauma,

08:55.327 --> 08:58.247
MS, schizophrenia, or pills.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.458
Schizophrenia usually
manifests younger.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.335
That's why it's further
down the list.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.463
I can confirm an infection
with a simple blood test.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.049
An infection can
be treated, cured.

09:09.174 --> 09:12.803
Means you've still got a job,
means you've still got a life.

09:12.928 --> 09:15.639
Doesn't make it a better idea,
just a nicer one.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.141
This the rational
you talking?

09:19.685 --> 09:21.395
Can't do this on my own.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.486
FOREMAN: When we inject the water
it's gonna feel like you're drowning.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.863
But it'll be over
in a few seconds.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.073
And then it'll be better?

09:33.198 --> 09:34.199
A little.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.326
Hold her shoulders
down a little.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.583
Ready?

09:44.668 --> 09:46.044
(MOANS)

09:49.756 --> 09:50.924
(WHIMPERING)

09:52.342 --> 09:54.803
You're doing great.
Here comes the liquid.

09:59.891 --> 10:00.726
(COUGHING)

10:01.435 --> 10:02.269
FOREMAN: Taub.

10:02.394 --> 10:03.228
I slipped.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.771
- Oh, no.
- What?

10:04.896 --> 10:06.356
Her skin came off.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.691
(CRYING)

10:19.536 --> 10:21.163
Her skin's sloughing off
faster than

10:21.288 --> 10:23.123
we can replace it
with the artificial skin.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.291
THIRTEEN: Could be autoimmune.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.543
FOREMAN: ANA was negative.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.086
HOUSE: Focus on the lungs.

10:28.211 --> 10:31.840
FOREMAN: You want us to ignore the fact
that she's lost 80% of her skin?

10:31.965 --> 10:35.093
We know it's not lung cancer.
Could be a liver tumor.

10:35.218 --> 10:38.305
Eats through to the lungs.
Get an ultrasound of her liver.

10:38.430 --> 10:40.182
If you find masses,
get a biopsy.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.017
We can't just
ignore the skin.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.352
It's obviously
the most significant

10:43.477 --> 10:45.228
and dangerous
symptom right now.

10:45.354 --> 10:49.107
I don't think it is a symptom.
I think we caused it.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.317
By doing what?

10:50.442 --> 10:52.611
I prescribed antibiotics.

10:52.736 --> 10:56.990
Toxic epidermal necrolysis? That's a
one-in-a-million reaction.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.202
Yeah, well,
maybe this is the one.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.080
Get swabs of her
old skin to confirm.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.391
Where the hell were you?

11:22.516 --> 11:23.892
I do have a practice.

11:24.017 --> 11:27.437
Ballerina has toxic
epidermal necrolysis.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.189
Are you sure?

11:29.314 --> 11:30.315
About to be.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.525
I'm sorry.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.235
I feel guilty.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.194
You didn't do
anything wrong.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.071
You prescribed
antibiotics.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.115
Any other doctor would have done
the exact same thing.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.118
"Any other doctor"?
Words can hurt, you know.

11:43.286 --> 11:46.873
I have no reason to feel guilty.
It doesn't make any sense.

11:46.998 --> 11:47.999
Unless there's
something wrong

11:48.125 --> 11:50.210
in the limbic area of my brain.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.378
Guilt as a symptom?

11:51.503 --> 11:53.588
It's consistent with MS.

11:54.965 --> 11:59.219
And since the blood tests were negative,
I have to apologize.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.097
If I feel better, then you're right.
I'm just feeling an emotion.

12:02.222 --> 12:06.560
If I feel nothing,
means my limbic brain is shot.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.243
I'm Dr. House.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.539
Anyone explain to you
your status?

12:29.791 --> 12:32.335
They found a mass
in my liver, cancer.

12:32.461 --> 12:34.337
They said they think
they can treat it.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.214
And that the skin
is starting to take.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.175
I'll be able to dance again.

12:38.300 --> 12:42.012
She's half-dead and she's wondering
if she'll ever plié again.

12:42.137 --> 12:45.056
Healthy priorities.
Let the mocking begin.

12:47.893 --> 12:49.269
I'm sorry.

12:52.063 --> 12:56.902
I treated you for infection
before confirming that you had one.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.696
That's why you lost
your skin.

12:59.821 --> 13:04.826
I know you're in pain. I know
that I caused it. I'm sorry.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.121
Very nice.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.418
Thank you.

13:19.216 --> 13:20.550
Nothing.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.353
Maybe you didn't mean it.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.146
I meant it.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.564
Did you do a liver biopsy to confirm...

13:34.689 --> 13:38.485
FOREMAN: Couldn't. The artificial skin
was too thin, she'd bleed out.

13:38.610 --> 13:40.737
Why were you talking
to the patient?

13:40.862 --> 13:42.948
I think skinless women are hot.

13:43.073 --> 13:45.116
Do a transjugular
liver biopsy.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.410
If she bleeds, at least
it stays in her veins.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.874
Did you just check
with Wilson again?

13:52.999 --> 13:54.000
No.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.383
I felt nothing. It's MS.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.260
Apologies aren't supposed
to make you feel better,

14:03.385 --> 14:04.761
they're supposed to make
the other person feel better.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.179
In order to make
you feel better.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.265
Fine. You want to do
an LP to confirm

14:08.390 --> 14:11.268
or is guilt enough to start
filling prescriptions?

14:15.522 --> 14:18.066
Last mass, about a centimeter
to your right.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.195
Problem?

14:22.320 --> 14:24.489
Short burst of flutter.
We're almost done.

14:24.614 --> 14:26.491
Entering the right hepatic vein.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.954
Cameron kept her
dead husband's sperm.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.292
She doesn't like yours?

14:35.417 --> 14:37.377
She likes his better.

14:38.295 --> 14:40.797
Or at least she wants
to hang on to it

14:40.922 --> 14:44.259
in case mine is
unfaithful or something.

14:45.594 --> 14:46.928
Wow.

14:50.307 --> 14:52.225
Advancing two centimeters.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.311
You gotta let her do it.

14:54.436 --> 14:57.105
If you don't, you'll be stuck
with her forever.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.190
I want to be stuck
with her forever.

14:59.316 --> 15:03.111
She married a dying guy.
She has issues.

15:03.236 --> 15:08.825
You cannot leave her.
Ever. For any reason.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.493
Because then you're
not just the guy who left her,

15:10.619 --> 15:13.246
you're the guy
who killed her kids.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.540
(MACHINE BEEPING RAPIDLY)

15:15.665 --> 15:17.208
That's not a good rhythm.
Get out.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.878
Narrow complex tachycardia.
She's gonna crash.

15:25.175 --> 15:27.719
TAUB: Liver biopsy
was negative for cancer.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.638
But the procedure sent
her heart into A-Fib.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.723
We don't know it was the biopsy
that caused the heart problem.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.975
Maybe the heart caused
the lungs to collapse.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.727
Why is Wilson here?

15:35.852 --> 15:37.938
You were looking for cancer.
I thought it'd be helpful if...

15:38.063 --> 15:39.397
- We didn't find cancer.
- Yes,

15:39.522 --> 15:41.483
which you reported
to me five seconds ago.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.151
I thought I'd let him
finish his hols d'oeuvre

15:43.276 --> 15:44.653
before getting the bouncer
to take care of him.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.363
Until we can
regulate the heart,

15:46.488 --> 15:47.864
we can't get any
meaningful pictures,

15:47.989 --> 15:48.949
so we can't tell...

15:49.157 --> 15:50.784
Metoprolol can correct
irregular heart.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.661

Didn't work.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.162
Is Cuddy making
him oversee...

15:54.287 --> 15:55.580
No.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.583
TAUB: Heart's too irregular for MRI,
other scans wouldn't...

15:58.708 --> 16:01.503
Then you're
making him oversee your choices.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.839
You don't trust yourself.
Why?

16:08.385 --> 16:10.136
Wilson, get out.

16:10.261 --> 16:11.262
Are you sure?

16:11.388 --> 16:13.640
Do I need your approval
to throw you out?

16:20.230 --> 16:21.606
You happy now?

16:22.857 --> 16:26.027
There's only one time her heart's going
to be perfectly still for our pictures

16:26.152 --> 16:27.445
and that's when she's dead.

16:28.029 --> 16:31.950
If it's not MS,
severe mental illness

16:32.075 --> 16:33.785
and Vicodin are
all that's left.

16:34.995 --> 16:38.540
Mental illness means you can
no longer practice medicine.

16:38.665 --> 16:44.129
Vicodin means detox, which means pain.
For the rest of your life.

16:44.254 --> 16:47.048
Which means you can no longer
practice medicine.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.601
Are you saying we
should kill her?

16:58.727 --> 16:59.728
TAUB: No.

17:03.023 --> 17:06.192
If we stopped her heart, we could get
our pictures and then restart it.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.778
What if we can't restart it?

17:08.903 --> 17:10.613
Then she stays dead.

17:10.739 --> 17:12.949
We restart hearts
all the time.

17:13.074 --> 17:16.119
It'll take four minutes for us
to MRI her entire heart.

17:16.244 --> 17:19.581
And we only have three minutes
until there's brain damage.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.876
You sure about this?

17:23.001 --> 17:24.002
Yeah.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.758
Gonna stop her heart
so I can MRI it.

17:29.883 --> 17:34.888
I think it was her idea. The pneumonia
was her idea, almost killed the patient.

17:35.013 --> 17:35.972
"Her"?

17:36.097 --> 17:37.140
Oops.

17:39.309 --> 17:43.480
Kutner was secretly a woman,
that's why he killed himself.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.567
It's Amber.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.821
Your subconscious picked
my dead girlfriend?

17:51.946 --> 17:53.907
Yeah, the irrational part
of my brain

17:54.032 --> 17:55.075
works like the rational
part of yours.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.159
How about that?

17:56.284 --> 17:58.870
It raises questions.

17:58.995 --> 17:59.913
It answers questions.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.122
Who cares?

18:01.247 --> 18:03.625
I've got competing ideas.
They can't both be right.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.461
Everybody gets competing ideas.
Everybody has doubts.

18:06.586 --> 18:10.173
So is it regular radical, me radical
or me-out-of-my-mind radical?

18:10.298 --> 18:12.175
It's on the upper end
of you radical.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.344
Do you have any alternative?

18:14.469 --> 18:17.055
Nothing that anyone in my head
has come up with.

18:17.180 --> 18:19.474
Then you're as safe
as you can be.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.600
Great.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.897
You get the LP results back?

18:26.022 --> 18:27.524
Yeah.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.025
It's a big shock.
You don't have MS.

18:29.150 --> 18:32.237
But while I had your blood sample,
I checked Vicodin levels.

18:32.362 --> 18:33.446
Way too high.

18:33.571 --> 18:34.781
I need the pills.

18:34.906 --> 18:37.200
Not an argument. He knows
that's not an argument.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.701
It could still
be schizophrenia.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.329
House, if you're
on anti-psych meds,

18:41.454 --> 18:42.705
you're not going to
be able to practice...

18:42.831 --> 18:43.998
I know.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.918
You'd prefer
electroshock therapy to rehab?

18:47.043 --> 18:49.337
I'd prefer something
that could actually work.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.547
You're rationalizing.

18:50.672 --> 18:52.006
No kidding.

18:52.132 --> 18:55.844
I know that you're afraid of the pain,
but electroshock...

18:55.969 --> 18:59.889
Don't give me the cancer voice,
that overly earnest tone.

19:00.014 --> 19:04.310
Heart attack, stroke,
seizure, death or worse.

19:04.435 --> 19:06.062
Worse? Double death?

19:06.187 --> 19:08.439
You live but you damage the only thing
you care about:

19:08.565 --> 19:10.191
your rational mind.

19:17.073 --> 19:18.449
I'll make some calls.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.249
I'll actually be dead?

19:26.374 --> 19:29.210
Just your heart.
And just for a little while.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.670
Hopefully.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.107
I had an idea.

19:52.609 --> 19:53.943
Stop having ideas.

19:54.068 --> 19:55.320
Insulin shock.

19:56.321 --> 19:59.616
Yes, that's marginally
less dangerous than ECT,

19:59.741 --> 20:02.035
- puts you in a coma, could cause...
- It could work.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.120
If you had psychosis,
which you don't.

20:04.245 --> 20:07.123
I have no diarrhea,
no sweating, no vomiting,

20:07.248 --> 20:09.250
none of the symptoms
of Vicodin overdose.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.753
Yeah, except the
"I see dead people" thing.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.755
I've been popping pills
for years.

20:13.880 --> 20:17.050
I've only been seeing things for days.
Something changed.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.427
Vicodin addiction
is still more likely.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.679
So we're no longer
dealing in absolutes.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.389
House, I'll be up
in five minutes,

20:23.514 --> 20:26.434
then we can talk about how you'd
rather be in a coma than in rehab.

20:26.559 --> 20:31.064
Actually, if you could be up here
in two, that'd be really helpful.

20:31.189 --> 20:32.065
Why?

20:33.316 --> 20:36.069
Because I'm about to put myself
into insulin shock.

20:36.527 --> 20:37.654
Left atrium is fine.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.489
Left coronary
artery also fine.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.282
- We're almost at three minutes.
- Keep going.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.034
- Chordae tendineae clear.
- Right atrium is fine.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.744
- I gotta start her back up.
- We have some time.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.913
- We're over.
- Right coronary artery is fine.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.122
The three-minute threshold
is a guideline.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.999
She might have less.
We have to stop.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.210
What's that by the aorta?

20:52.335 --> 20:53.795
- I don't see anything.
- I'm restarting her heart.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.713

Two centimeters...

this is going to work.

She's been everywhere
I've been for days.

22:50.453 --> 22:52.288
She's not here. Ergo...

22:52.622 --> 22:54.874
This was not
the next rational step.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.043
Now who's being biased?

as much as I wanted...

to do my zipper.

as usual. Not sure that's a deficit.

- Absolutely.

repressing all kinds of icky things.

23:36.207 --> 23:38.459
He didn't see anything.
He saw an artifact on the monitor.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.670
It was a shadow
on her heart.

23:40.795 --> 23:43.047
She'd already been
technically dead for three minutes.

23:43.172 --> 23:47.009
I thought keeping her alive took
precedence over prolonging the photo op.

24:05.445 --> 24:07.029
Could be an abscess.

in the blood.

It's doing its damage
behind closed doors. Sealed off.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.494
See, the problem
with speculation is

24:13.619 --> 24:17.457
you make a "spec" out of you
and some guy named "Lation,"

24:17.582 --> 24:18.749

affect me at all.

24:18.875 --> 24:21.043
We have to guess.
It's all we've got.

24:21.169 --> 24:23.129
We can't do a biopsy.
Last time we went into her heart

24:23.254 --> 24:25.214
she had a major
cardiac event.

All by myself.

Too devoted?
You think he feels guilty?

25:04.921 --> 25:06.005
Right, I'm being cynical.

Theoretically true,
but gonorrhea fits better.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.763
No. No STDs. We tested her.

it'd be invisible.

like a shadow.

No need to test her again.
But we can check Prince Charming.

in the pink.

27:09.211 --> 27:12.632
The years go by

27:12.757 --> 27:13.716
(LAUGHING)

27:14.592 --> 27:18.179
As quickly as a wink

27:19.138 --> 27:21.349
Enjoy yourself

27:21.474 --> 27:24.268
Wilson, come get me.

27:24.560 --> 27:27.647
<i>It's later than you think</i>

27:27.772 --> 27:29.190
(LAUGHING)

27:41.035 --> 27:43.663
I know a nice facility
outside Philly.

27:44.205 --> 27:46.540
I went to undergrad
with one of the directors.

27:48.751 --> 27:49.877
Thanks.

28:04.058 --> 28:05.976
How many shirts do I need?

28:06.102 --> 28:09.480
They said three.
They have laundry.

28:09.605 --> 28:12.358
Like living with Mom again.
Delightful.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.735
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
It's probably Foreman.

28:18.781 --> 28:20.074
He's unavailable.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.826
Tell him the infection's
made her septic.

28:21.951 --> 28:23.786
We can't remove the abscess
until we get her BP up,

28:23.911 --> 28:25.705
and it's not responding
to fluids, it's not...

28:25.830 --> 28:27.289
He's off the case.

28:30.584 --> 28:31.711
Patient okay?

28:31.836 --> 28:32.837
Yeah.

28:32.962 --> 28:34.422
He's lying.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.932
Why don't I feel scared?

28:46.809 --> 28:49.937
I'd say you're unaware
of what you're feeling at this moment.

28:51.188 --> 28:55.359
I feel like crap, my life is falling
apart, but I don't feel scared.

28:56.152 --> 28:57.903
Not of the rehab, anyway.

28:58.028 --> 29:00.865
We've always been able
to find a way to cheat.

29:06.579 --> 29:07.955
It won't work.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.957
You want it to
work this time.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.625
Do we?

29:11.959 --> 29:15.379
House, it's
your only option.

29:16.172 --> 29:18.841
And what do I do
if my only option won't work?

29:20.050 --> 29:22.428
You don't give up.

29:26.682 --> 29:29.852
It's either that or electroshock
every six hours.

29:31.437 --> 29:32.813
Good night, Wilson.

29:34.607 --> 29:35.900
What if we put her on
a heart-lung machine?

29:36.025 --> 29:37.067
She's septic.

29:37.193 --> 29:38.402
We don't need
a heart-lung machine.

29:38.527 --> 29:41.030
We need a blood vessel
holder-together machine.

29:41.155 --> 29:42.782
FOREMAN: We could try
a high-dose dopamine.

29:42.907 --> 29:44.450
It's a vasoconstrictor.

29:44.575 --> 29:46.702
It'll close the blood vessels
so she won't bleed out.

29:46.827 --> 29:49.705
Her heart can't take
that much dopamine. It'll explode.

29:49.830 --> 29:51.999
FOREMAN: And if we don't
use the dopamine, it'll implode.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.335
Is House really done?

29:54.460 --> 29:55.628
Sounded that way.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.382
Dopamine it is.

30:20.444 --> 30:21.737
It's late and I'm tired.

30:21.862 --> 30:24.615
Can we get to the talking part
of this conversation?

30:25.491 --> 30:26.784
(SIGHS)

30:27.409 --> 30:29.203
I quit.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.412
Great.

30:32.748 --> 30:35.459
My nanny is off
the clock at 7:30.

30:35.584 --> 30:39.964
So your week off,
bigger desk,

30:41.799 --> 30:44.677
tighter nurses' uniforms,
or whatever

30:44.802 --> 30:47.137
other stupid thing
you're about to demand

30:47.263 --> 30:49.098
is gonna have
to wait until...

30:49.223 --> 30:51.517
You can go suckle
the little bastard child

30:51.642 --> 30:53.769
who makes you feel
good about yourself.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.064
Screw you.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.196
Don't do this.

31:04.321 --> 31:05.656
I'm hallucinating.

31:08.325 --> 31:09.785
From the Vicodin?

31:12.454 --> 31:14.081
Ruled out everything else.

31:21.714 --> 31:25.050
We can admit you
through the ER

31:25.175 --> 31:27.428
under a pseudonym.
No one has to...

31:27.553 --> 31:31.682
I'll cheat, scam,
find some way to keep using.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.267
These people know
what they're doing.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.102
These people don't know me.

31:36.562 --> 31:37.396
You do.

31:37.521 --> 31:41.525
She's not your keeper. She has
no responsibility for you.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.155
I need you.

31:52.161 --> 31:53.704
Let me call my babysitter.

32:07.885 --> 32:09.219
TAUB: Blood pressure
is 90 over 60.

32:09.470 --> 32:10.304
We know.

32:10.429 --> 32:13.641
I'm just saying, it's still 90 over 60.
It's holding.

32:13.766 --> 32:15.351
Abscess is intact.

32:15.476 --> 32:17.978
Doesn't look like any of
the surrounding tissue is affected.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.730
She's gonna be fine.

32:19.855 --> 32:20.898
NURSE: Doctor.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.372
We've got a problem.

32:39.249 --> 32:40.542
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

32:44.171 --> 32:46.882
Lie down.
I'll get you some tea.

32:48.759 --> 32:51.303
Yeah, then I'll be better.

33:00.145 --> 33:03.774
You really think she hasn't searched
this place for your secret stash?

33:08.195 --> 33:13.200
I already did this room,
and the bathroom and your bedroom.

33:15.077 --> 33:17.871
Where should I look
in the kitchen?

33:19.957 --> 33:23.293
Coffee cup.
In the top shelf.

33:23.419 --> 33:26.422
That was a test.
I already did the kitchen.

33:26.547 --> 33:30.217
Nicely played. She'll think
you've come clean, given her everything.

33:32.428 --> 33:33.637
There's more.

33:33.762 --> 33:37.224
Don't. You're hurting already.
It'll only get worse.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.977
House, you should
tell me where it is now,

33:40.102 --> 33:43.772
because you won't have the will
to tell me in two hours.

33:48.569 --> 33:50.779
In my shoes.
In the closet.

33:52.448 --> 33:55.659
It's like I don't even know
who you are anymore.

34:02.666 --> 34:03.834
(GRUNTING)

34:04.501 --> 34:07.129
It's okay. Hold my hand.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.234
Am I Okay?

34:29.735 --> 34:33.197
We were able to successfully remove
the abscess from your heart.

34:33.322 --> 34:34.823
But the dopamine
caused the blood vessels

34:34.948 --> 34:37.618
in your hands and feet to clamp shut.

34:38.243 --> 34:42.539
We need to amputate or the gangrene
will spread, and you'll die.

34:43.082 --> 34:44.166
(CLEARS THROAT)

34:44.625 --> 34:46.418
My feet?

34:46.543 --> 34:49.797
And your hands.
I'm sorry.

34:53.133 --> 34:55.803
No. I'm a dancer.

34:55.928 --> 34:58.764
The tissue can't be saved.

34:58.889 --> 34:59.890
No.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.940
TAUB: We know what
House would do.

35:08.065 --> 35:10.442
CHASE: House would have
never woken her up to ask for consent.

35:10.567 --> 35:12.319
If you can't live with the answer,
don't ask the question.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.321
You're saying
we should accept her decision?

35:14.446 --> 35:16.281
Bold idea, I know.

35:16.406 --> 35:18.283
Maybe we can get the boyfriend
to convince her to do it.

35:18.408 --> 35:20.869
Yeah, boyfriends get
everything they want.

35:22.287 --> 35:25.499
Forget it. The boyfriend
doesn't want to talk to her at all.

35:26.708 --> 35:27.709
TAUB: Where are you going?

35:27.835 --> 35:29.253
Home. The case is over.

35:29.378 --> 35:31.421
No, it's not.
Not until we come up

35:31.547 --> 35:33.674
with something
that might work.

35:33.799 --> 35:35.676
It's a shame
that she might die

35:35.801 --> 35:38.428
because House has some personal crap
to work through.

35:38.554 --> 35:40.264
Technically, if she dies,

35:40.389 --> 35:42.266
it's because House
has some personal crap to work through

35:42.391 --> 35:45.644
and we weren't smart enough
to get the answer without him.

36:02.244 --> 36:04.204
False alarm.

36:04.329 --> 36:05.998
Drink this.

36:06.123 --> 36:08.375
That's your advice?
Drink this?

36:09.209 --> 36:12.254
It's ginger.
It'll ease the nausea.

36:12.379 --> 36:14.339
You know what
would calm the nausea?

36:14.464 --> 36:19.303
Vicodin. Marijuana. A coma.

36:22.097 --> 36:24.183
Don't pretend
you didn't see it.

36:24.308 --> 36:26.476
I saw it,
which means you saw it.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.021
Send her away.

36:35.194 --> 36:38.864
Too bitter.
I already have enough bitter.

36:38.989 --> 36:40.073
I'll add some honey.

36:47.206 --> 36:49.124
You're pathetic.

36:49.249 --> 36:51.501
If you want the pill,
just send her home.

36:52.211 --> 36:56.089
But you can't, because that would be
admitting defeat to her.

37:10.479 --> 37:12.314
Now this is interesting.

37:12.439 --> 37:15.275
If you take the pill,
you don't deserve her.

37:15.400 --> 37:19.780
If you secretly take the pill,
you don't deserve anyone.

37:25.118 --> 37:26.870
No!

37:26.995 --> 37:31.291
No. No!

37:51.561 --> 37:52.938
This isn't going to work.

37:53.146 --> 37:56.024
It might work.
That's all we're going for.

37:56.149 --> 37:57.109
Vasodilators can...

37:57.234 --> 37:59.903
Big jump from reopening
to reanimating.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.030
I'm out of the ulnar.

38:03.198 --> 38:05.784
Not seeing any clearing.
This won't work.

38:05.909 --> 38:07.953
This probably won't work.

38:08.078 --> 38:09.121
Radial artery's really tight.

38:09.246 --> 38:12.207
Don't go too fast. If it clots,
she loses the hand.

38:12.332 --> 38:14.626
If it clots,
she's dead.

38:19.256 --> 38:20.590
I can't believe it.

38:20.716 --> 38:21.883
What?

38:23.510 --> 38:25.846
It might be working.

38:39.860 --> 38:41.403
Can you stop?

38:42.612 --> 38:44.323
The breathing.

38:46.366 --> 38:48.660
Air goes in,
air goes out.

38:48.785 --> 38:50.287
Use your nose.

38:51.246 --> 38:54.916
You're supposed to feel like crap.
You're doing great.

38:57.294 --> 39:00.297
- And after?
- You come back to work.

39:01.882 --> 39:03.508
What if I can't?

39:07.095 --> 39:09.097
Opioid dependency
can make you think

39:09.222 --> 39:11.308
you have more pain
than you really have.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.603
You're going to be okay.

39:14.728 --> 39:17.314
You're telling me what I want to hear,
with no evidence.

39:17.439 --> 39:19.399
I'm telling you what I
believe to be the truth.

39:19.524 --> 39:20.650
With no evidence.

39:20.776 --> 39:23.070
You're hardly the most
unbiased observer.

39:23.195 --> 39:24.363
Neither are you.

39:26.281 --> 39:28.367
I'm your hospital's
biggest asset.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.789
Is that why you
think I'm here?

39:34.206 --> 39:36.083
That's why you're here, that's why
you're lying to me about...

39:36.208 --> 39:39.586
I haven't lied
to you in 20 years.

39:39.711 --> 39:40.754
Sure you have.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.051
Which means that
you just said that

39:46.176 --> 39:49.429
because you want to tell me what
you lied to me about 20 years ago.

39:51.515 --> 39:53.683
You're an ass.

39:53.809 --> 39:55.060
Am I wrong?

39:58.397 --> 40:00.565
I wasn't in your
endocrinology class.

40:03.652 --> 40:05.529
You sat next to me.
I cheated off you in the mid-term.

40:05.654 --> 40:07.823
I audited your
endocrinology class.

40:09.825 --> 40:11.326
Why would you...

40:11.451 --> 40:16.706
Because I thought you were
an interesting lunatic even then.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.838
I'm not here protecting
hospital property.

40:34.266 --> 40:35.725
We're alone.

40:38.728 --> 40:40.355
We've been alone all night.

40:42.274 --> 40:43.859
No, I mean Amber.

40:46.361 --> 40:47.529
She's gone.

41:06.631 --> 41:08.925
Where's Jeremy?

41:09.050 --> 41:10.051
He left.

41:15.265 --> 41:16.433
You Okay?

41:29.821 --> 41:31.990
The surgery worked.

41:32.115 --> 41:33.283
Congratulations.

41:38.246 --> 41:40.040
I can't do it.

41:43.668 --> 41:46.379
You have doubts.

41:46.505 --> 41:47.714
You don't?

41:49.049 --> 41:50.342
No.

41:52.886 --> 41:54.429
That's

41:57.140 --> 41:58.433
naive.

41:59.226 --> 42:02.729
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you. I love you.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.356
That's how I feel
right now,

42:04.481 --> 42:09.444
but I don't know.

42:12.906 --> 42:14.908
I'll wait until you do.

42:17.702 --> 42:22.374
I can't know.
No one knows.

42:25.126 --> 42:26.086
I do.

42:34.678 --> 42:38.598
I'll see you in later?
I have some papers to push for you.

42:41.893 --> 42:43.395
Thank you.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.317
You want to kiss me,
don't you?

42:52.404 --> 42:53.780
I always want to kiss you.
