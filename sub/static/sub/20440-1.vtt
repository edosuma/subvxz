WEBVTT

00:05.273 --> 00:07.175
Last season on Bosch...

00:07.241 --> 00:09.043
Don't walk away from--

00:10.211 --> 00:11.512
- Oh!
- Hey! Hey!

00:11.579 --> 00:13.814
Hey, Harry.
How's it hanging?

00:13.881 --> 00:15.549
Welcome back, partner.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.885
A man named Anthony Allen was
murdered over the weekend.

00:17.951 --> 00:19.220
Ohh!

00:19.287 --> 00:20.521
His body was
discovered yesterday

00:20.588 --> 00:22.456
in the trunk of his car
above Mulholland.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.558
When you're finished here,
go notify the next of kin.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.294
- Do we know who that is yet?
- Veronica Allen.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.461
Well, do you have a suspect?

00:27.528 --> 00:29.130
We came up here
to talk to Carl Nash,

00:29.197 --> 00:30.531
but he's not
at work today.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.500
Why on earth would you
want to speak with him?

00:32.566 --> 00:34.835
He's become a person
of interest in this case.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.337
Not that you'd know this,

00:36.404 --> 00:38.272
but he's got
quite a checkered past.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.143
My lawyer called.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.212
Should be on the
probate docket any day.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.846
When exactly?

00:45.913 --> 00:48.749
Soon. Just be patient.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.751
Patience is my middle name.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.520
These cases
are 35 years old.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.423
Doesn't matter. A friend
of my mother's contacted me,

00:55.489 --> 00:57.891
told me my mother went there
the night she was murdered.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.493
This is new information.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.828
Who was he?

01:00.894 --> 01:02.530
He called himself Mitch.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.432
It's the only name
I ever knew him by.

01:04.498 --> 01:07.000
What about the detective?
Do you remember his name?

01:07.067 --> 01:08.936
- No, I--
- Was it Caffrey?

01:09.002 --> 01:10.138
John Caffrey?

01:10.204 --> 01:12.806
Fox Mitchell
was an alias, okay?

01:12.873 --> 01:14.375
He was a snitch.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.210
You didn't even talk
to him off book?

01:16.277 --> 01:18.579
I did the right thing.
I asked Narcotics

01:18.646 --> 01:20.714
to make him available
for questioning.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.216
That request was denied.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.385
So you just
laid down on it.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.854
So what's going on at home?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.156
I don't know.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.491
Mom and Reggie were
arguing a lot,

01:30.558 --> 01:32.893
and then all of a sudden
he goes to Hong Kong.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.662
There's been an
officer-involved shooting.

01:34.728 --> 01:37.731
I got a call to pick you up
and bring you to the scene.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.006
Oh, my boy.

01:46.073 --> 01:48.242
In memory of your son,

01:48.309 --> 01:50.678
and on behalf
of a grateful city

01:50.744 --> 01:53.714
and the Los Angeles
Police Department.

01:53.781 --> 01:58.219
You... killed him.

01:58.286 --> 02:01.021
I can't stand
to look at you.

02:01.088 --> 02:04.292
I agreed to accept the position
of Interim Chief of Police

02:04.358 --> 02:05.759
to honor my son

02:05.826 --> 02:08.896
and help lead the department
out of this current crisis.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.399
But I will not be accepting
the job permanently,

02:11.465 --> 02:13.301
no matter
who wins the election.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.002
You're just gonna walk away?

02:15.068 --> 02:17.004
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.239
Not without
my fucking money.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.707
You know, I'm
calling the police.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.675
No, you are not!

02:21.742 --> 02:23.244
What happened?

02:23.311 --> 02:25.045
He attacked me.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.180
And how many times
did you hit him?

02:26.247 --> 02:27.981
Once or-- or twice.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.683
I don't--
I don't really remember.

02:29.750 --> 02:30.751
I was terrified.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.621
- You feared for your life.
- I did.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.257
So is that enough?

02:36.324 --> 02:38.392
- Bosch!
- I'm good!

02:45.566 --> 02:46.600
Aah!

02:49.102 --> 02:50.404
Shit.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.810
Arno Apperson,

02:56.877 --> 02:58.546
also known
as Fox Mitchell.

02:58.612 --> 03:01.682
These are names I haven't
heard in a long time.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.317
What are you
looking at him for?

03:03.384 --> 03:05.953
Murder of Marjorie Lowe,

03:06.019 --> 03:07.154
my mother.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.457
Jesus.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.661
You tied Apperson
to your mother's murder?

03:13.727 --> 03:15.496
No, he did it.
And this department,

03:15.563 --> 03:17.598
the D.A.'s office
protected him afterward,

03:17.665 --> 03:20.334
put him in
the Relocation Program.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.902
I want to know
where he is.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.071
I'll see what I
can find out.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.606
What's up, man?

03:25.673 --> 03:27.875
I'm looking for
Big Wave Dave. He around?

03:27.941 --> 03:29.843
He's been dead a while now.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.379
This him?

03:31.445 --> 03:33.981
Yeah. Dave Arenson.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.275
Shit.

06:06.767 --> 06:07.901
Fuck.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.605
Fuck.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.682
All right. All right.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.424
Shit.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.237
Returning
from the national picture,

06:44.304 --> 06:45.906
with 80% of the vote counted,

06:45.973 --> 06:48.842
incumbent mayor Hector Ramos
has an 11-point lead

06:48.909 --> 06:51.979
over Republican challenger
District Attorney Rick O'Shea.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.681
Some observers believe

06:53.747 --> 06:55.516
O'Shea's bid
for the city's top job

06:55.583 --> 06:57.417
was fatally damaged
a year ago

06:57.485 --> 06:58.919
by the video that showed him

06:58.986 --> 07:00.721
ordering
the shacklesremoved

07:00.788 --> 07:02.690
from a murder suspect
who then escaped custody,

07:02.756 --> 07:04.424
shooting a prosecutor

07:04.492 --> 07:05.993
and wounding
a police detective.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.928
There are still
two years remaining

07:07.995 --> 07:10.297
to O'Shea's term
as District Attorney,

07:10.363 --> 07:11.832
but the once rising star

07:11.899 --> 07:14.201
appears to be at
a crossroads in his career.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.449
Think you've had enough.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.018
Fuck you I've had enough.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.920
I'll tell you
when I've had enough.

07:32.986 --> 07:37.190
Got no call to cut me off
long as he's buying.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.064
Pour yourself one.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.700
It's on him.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.001
That okay with you?

07:48.068 --> 07:50.037
Why the fuck not?

07:52.139 --> 07:54.107
- There you go.
- That's good.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.820
From Atwater Village
to Arlington Heights,

08:06.887 --> 08:09.122
from Highland Park
to the Hollywood Hills,

08:09.189 --> 08:10.824
From Sylmar to South L.A.--

08:10.891 --> 08:12.693
...the people of Los Angeles

08:12.760 --> 08:15.729
have sent a message,
a strong message, that--

08:15.796 --> 08:18.365
- Bosch.
- This is Webster at Rampart.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.433
Sorry to bother you so late,

08:20.500 --> 08:22.736
but I got Ed Gunn here again.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.304
What do you want me
to do with him?

08:24.371 --> 08:25.639
Keep him awake
till I get there.

08:25.706 --> 08:26.907
I'm on my way.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.177
Conscious when I called you.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.913
I swear.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.448
- What's this mutt to you?
- Cold case.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.250
Serial killer.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.019
No shit.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.420
Him?

08:40.487 --> 08:42.856
Who'd he kill?
Some other rummies?

08:43.991 --> 08:46.059
Couple young women,
back in the day.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.394
Gonna book him?

08:47.460 --> 08:49.029
The sheriffs
don't want him.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.164
We'll frick him
in the morning,

08:51.231 --> 08:52.733
soon as he's sober.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.367
I'll be back
before that happens.

08:54.434 --> 08:55.703
I need a word.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.743
**

11:02.562 --> 11:05.298
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

11:05.365 --> 11:07.534
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

11:07.600 --> 11:10.570
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

11:10.637 --> 11:13.073
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

11:13.140 --> 11:16.143
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

11:16.209 --> 11:18.378
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

11:18.445 --> 11:21.749
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

11:21.815 --> 11:23.050
* I can't let go *

11:35.628 --> 11:38.465
* I feel *

11:47.975 --> 11:49.542
Enter the code.

11:52.612 --> 11:55.949
8979.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.361
- This it?
- Yeah, this is it.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.329
Right here.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.397
Okay.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.032
All right.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.200
Okay.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.235
Where are your keys?

12:15.302 --> 12:17.771
Wait a minute.
I got them.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.439
All right.

12:19.506 --> 12:20.941
Oh, you got 'em?

12:21.008 --> 12:22.175
Okay. Good. Come on.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.344
- Okay.
- Come on. Thank you.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.612
- Morning.
- Morning.

13:32.679 --> 13:33.813
Breakfast?

13:33.881 --> 13:34.948
I'll grab
something at school.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.249
You look nice.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.585
Thanks.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.752
I got court today.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.088
But tired.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.324
Up late
watching the returns.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.760
Presidential election?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.529
Dad, don't be a derp.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.465
I'm totally putting you on.
I even know who won.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.334
Uh-huh. I'm gonna
quiz you on that later.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.003
I'm gonna be able
to vote next year.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.071
Oof. That's
a terrifying thought.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.740
And when are you gonna
let me get my license?

14:00.807 --> 14:03.310
Hmm. Significantly
more terrifying thought.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.312
I have my permit.
You can teach me.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.681
Whoa. Hat trick.
You're on a roll.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.417
But you already testified.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.953
No, the defense lawyer
reserved their
cross examination

14:13.020 --> 14:14.454
until the end
of their case.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.823
- Do you think she'll get off?
- Might.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.225
Can't predict juries.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.859
And you're sure she did it?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.562
Beyond a reasonable doubt.

14:22.629 --> 14:23.863
You're gonna say that?

14:23.931 --> 14:25.465
I can only answer
the questions they ask me

14:25.532 --> 14:26.466
truthfully.

14:28.969 --> 14:30.737
- Uch.
- What?

14:30.803 --> 14:31.871
You were doing so well.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.374
I'm gonna quit again.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.809
I promise.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.011
Soon.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.485
I want you to see this.

14:47.955 --> 14:49.056
Okay?

14:49.122 --> 14:50.223
You shouldn't litter.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.858
You said
you wanted me to stop.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.660
I-- I just stopped.
You saw it.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.895
For real this time?
You promise?

14:57.931 --> 14:59.366
I promise.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.833
Truthfully?

15:00.900 --> 15:03.203
You really do
take after your mother.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.286
What the fuck?

15:20.820 --> 15:22.489
5:25 a.m. $500 bond.

15:22.555 --> 15:23.590
Who wrote the bond?

15:24.691 --> 15:25.792
AAA Bail.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.160
He was gonna
be released anyway.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.962
Who'd waste the money
to bail him out?

15:29.029 --> 15:30.897
- Family. Friend.
- He's got no friends.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.499
Sister washed her hands
of him years ago.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.334
And how the hell would
she know he was here?

15:34.401 --> 15:36.069
- Called her?
- He didn't call anybody.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.537
He's a black-out drunk.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.073
He washes up on you again,
I want to be notified.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.208
It's in the computer,
detective.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.476
Just make sure it happens.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.216
Yes?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.551
Mayor Ramos here to see you.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.186
Send him in.

15:59.392 --> 16:01.894
- Irv.
- Mr. Mayor.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.696
Jen.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.166
This is a surprise.
I would have come to you.

16:06.233 --> 16:09.536
Doing my victory lap.
You're my first stop.

16:10.770 --> 16:11.804
Please have a seat.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.640
And congratulations.

16:13.706 --> 16:14.907
Thank you.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.176
It was a great night.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.145
Get you anything?
Water? Coffee?

16:18.211 --> 16:19.912
No. We're good.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.614
Thank you, Ida.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.419
I wanted to thank you
in person for your support.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.622
I doubt it made
much of a difference.

16:29.689 --> 16:30.990
Numbers say otherwise.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.759
You're a popular dude,
Chief--

16:32.825 --> 16:34.327
south of I-10,
east of the river,

16:34.394 --> 16:35.728
Westside,
even the Valley.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.465
The Valley?
Imagine that.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.168
So we're grateful.

16:41.234 --> 16:45.172
You know, you could use
the Chief's office.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.973
It's nicer than mine.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.575
I'm happy here.

16:48.641 --> 16:52.112
Besides, I wouldn't want
to send the wrong message.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.515
We know you've had
other offers.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.519
I haven't accepted any.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.321
Good to hear.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.656
I still intend to step down
at the end of the year.

17:03.723 --> 17:07.427
Then we have till then
to change your mind.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.504
Detective,
you testified previously

17:17.570 --> 17:20.140
that, when you encountered
Mrs. Allen in the church,

17:20.207 --> 17:21.308
she was distraught.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.642
She seemed to be, yes.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.078
There was blood
on her right hand.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.546
There was blood on her dress.

17:26.613 --> 17:29.082
And upon entering
Father Tabakian's office,

17:29.149 --> 17:30.217
what did you see?

17:30.283 --> 17:32.018
He was lying on the floor.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.920
The back of his head
had been bashed in.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.822
He was unresponsive,
not breathing.

17:35.888 --> 17:40.427
A heavy trophy was lying
nearby, covered in blood,

17:40.493 --> 17:42.262
and a pair of scissors
had been placed

17:42.329 --> 17:43.530
under his left hand.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.366
- Placed?
- That was my impression.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.867
Placed?

17:47.934 --> 17:49.236
By whom, in your opinion?

17:49.302 --> 17:51.037
The defendant.
Mrs. Allen.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.639
You didn't
witness her do that.

17:52.705 --> 17:53.740
No.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.508
Were her fingerprints
on the scissors?

17:55.575 --> 17:56.609
No.

17:56.676 --> 17:57.944
Were any prints found
on the scissors?

17:58.010 --> 17:59.346
Father Tabakian's.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.581
What was your initial
assessment at the scene?

18:01.648 --> 18:03.883
That they had quarreled
over the money,

18:03.950 --> 18:06.719
that Mrs. Allen had
struck Father Tabakian
with the trophy,

18:06.786 --> 18:09.322
and then planted
the scissors in his hand

18:09.389 --> 18:11.658
to make it look
like self-defense.

18:11.724 --> 18:13.193
Detective,
your partner testified

18:13.260 --> 18:15.094
that you told him
from the beginning

18:15.162 --> 18:16.296
you believed the scissors
were planted.

18:16.363 --> 18:17.797
- That is correct.
- You never considered

18:17.864 --> 18:19.366
that her story of
self-defense might be true?

18:19.432 --> 18:21.201
Considered and dismissed.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.206
Detective, weren't you
a defendant in a civil suit

18:26.273 --> 18:28.007
where you were accused
of planting evidence?

18:28.074 --> 18:29.309
Yes.

18:29.376 --> 18:30.943
What was the outcome
of that lawsuit?

18:31.010 --> 18:32.479
The jury found
for the plaintiff.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.416
Nothing further.

18:38.685 --> 18:42.121
Detective, did the jury
in that case conclude

18:42.189 --> 18:43.790
that you had planted evidence?

18:43.856 --> 18:46.092
- No.
- Did the findings against you

18:46.159 --> 18:48.528
involve falsifying
of evidence in any way?

18:48.595 --> 18:49.962
No.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.298
And the total amount
in damages

18:51.364 --> 18:52.632
awarded to the plaintiff?

18:52.699 --> 18:53.766
One dollar.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.335
One dollar.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.970
Nothing further, Your Honor.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.872
The witness may step down.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.380
Ms. Chandler,
any other witnesses?

19:07.447 --> 19:08.681
Uh, just one, Your Honor.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.418
The defense calls
Mrs. Anthony Allen.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.554
Uh, Your Honor,
given the late hour,

19:14.621 --> 19:16.623
I suggest we recess
for the day.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.225
Court will resume
in the morning

19:18.291 --> 19:19.726
with Mrs. Allen's testimony.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.369
Señor Bosch.

19:29.436 --> 19:30.503
Gracias, Gladys.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.804
De nada.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.743
- Gracias.
- De nada.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.126
Talk to your mom lately?

19:54.193 --> 19:55.362
We Skyped Sunday.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.896
You should make that
a standing date--

19:56.963 --> 19:58.931
once a week, Sunday.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.067
Well, her Sunday
or my Sunday?

20:01.133 --> 20:02.569
Whichever.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.337
The time difference.
It's so hard.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.938
Plus, she and Reggie
work nights.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.074
It's morning here,
it's evening in Hong Kong,

20:08.140 --> 20:09.175
and it's not even
the same day.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.311
Okay. Don't whine.
Just try.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.712
I'm not whining.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.247
Okay.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.085
You've been working
late a lot.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.720
Prepping the Holland trial.

20:22.188 --> 20:24.657
What? What's that look?

20:24.724 --> 20:26.726
Nothing.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.628
You've been spending
a lot of time with her.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.030
Her? Who? Anita?

20:31.097 --> 20:33.065
Oh, that's what you
call her? Anita?

20:33.132 --> 20:35.268
Deputy DA Benitez to you.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.703
Whatever.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.739
When's the trial?

20:39.806 --> 20:40.940
A few weeks.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.675
I've got court
in the morning,

20:42.742 --> 20:44.444
then tomorrow we go
over to his house,

20:44.511 --> 20:46.112
revisit the crime scene.

20:46.178 --> 20:47.280
Will he be there?

20:47.347 --> 20:48.781
Yeah. He's under
house arrest.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.784
- What's he like?
- Andrew Holland?

20:51.851 --> 20:53.386
He's a creep.

20:53.453 --> 20:54.821
His movies are creepy.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.188
You've seen his movies?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.658
My friends like them
more than I do.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.260
Will you have to testify?

21:01.328 --> 21:02.562
Yeah.

21:02.629 --> 21:03.996
- Can I come watch you?
- No.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.333
- Why not?
- It's a murder trial, Maddie.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.834
It's not an entertainment.

21:07.900 --> 21:08.935
Dad, get real.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.437
It so is an
entertainment.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.306
Famous director kills an
aspiring actress during sex.

21:14.641 --> 21:15.975
All my friends
think it's cool

21:16.042 --> 21:17.977
that you were the one
who arrested him.

21:21.247 --> 21:23.716
He's not famous.

21:23.783 --> 21:24.951
He is now.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.024
I went there
to get my money back.

21:32.091 --> 21:35.094
The money your husband's
mistress stole from you.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.397
And gave
to Father Tabakian.

21:37.464 --> 21:40.299
I explained to him

21:40.367 --> 21:42.435
who she was
and what she'd done.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.103
And how did he respond?

21:44.170 --> 21:46.138
He defended her.

21:46.205 --> 21:48.107
She was so innocent,
so pure.

21:48.174 --> 21:49.642
He didn't believe me.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.478
What did you do then?

21:51.544 --> 21:53.279
I showed him the pictures
of them together.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.682
And how did he
respond to that?

21:55.748 --> 21:57.850
He--

21:57.917 --> 21:59.819
He got so angry.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.422
He told me to leave.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.257
He said he'd never
give me my money back.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.026
And then he threatened me.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.495
He threatened you?

22:08.561 --> 22:10.397
Said he'd call the police,
have me arrested.

22:10.463 --> 22:11.731
Then he--

22:13.500 --> 22:16.369
he put his hands on me.

22:17.570 --> 22:18.738
Take your time.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.040
Thank you.

22:24.411 --> 22:25.678
He began...

22:27.179 --> 22:29.549
pushing me
toward the door.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.052
And he--

22:34.821 --> 22:36.723
he picked up
a pair of scissors,

22:36.789 --> 22:39.225
and...

22:39.291 --> 22:40.927
came at me again.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.028
What did you do?

22:42.094 --> 22:44.797
I grabbed the nearest
thing I could

22:44.864 --> 22:45.898
to defend myself.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.066
The trophy.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.369
He lunged at me.

22:50.437 --> 22:52.371
I thought he was
going to kill me,

22:52.439 --> 22:54.941
so I-- I-- I hit him.

22:56.776 --> 22:59.078
I hit him.
I had no choice.

23:00.312 --> 23:02.081
I'm so, so sorry.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.987
- ...as soon as possible.
- Right.

23:09.288 --> 23:10.356
Detectives.

23:10.423 --> 23:11.991
Mr. District Attorney.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.360
Kind of ballsy of her to put
her client on the stand.

23:14.427 --> 23:15.628
Could've backfired.

23:15.695 --> 23:18.030
Mrs. Allen was
a compelling witness.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.432
What's your gut?

23:19.499 --> 23:21.100
We'll see.

23:21.167 --> 23:23.536
I thought Amanda did
the best she could
on the redirect,

23:23.603 --> 23:26.205
given that you did
lose that case,

23:26.272 --> 23:27.774
dollar or no dollar.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.576
I meant, any guess on
when the jury comes back?

23:29.642 --> 23:30.910
If I were to bet,

23:30.977 --> 23:33.446
tomorrow afternoon
at the latest.

23:33.513 --> 23:35.848
My office will
give you a heads up.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.686
Should've taken that bet.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.420
Asshole.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.122
Headed
back to the house?

23:43.189 --> 23:45.658
I gotta go do this thing
with Benitez.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.960
The Holland case?
How's that going?

23:48.027 --> 23:50.930
In a rational world,
it'd be a slam dunk.

23:52.499 --> 23:55.134
She's kind of a dish,
Benitez.

23:55.201 --> 23:56.636
Is she?

23:56.703 --> 23:58.304
I mean for someone
who's age appropriate.

23:58.370 --> 23:59.539
Fuck you.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.440
You ought to ask her out.

24:01.508 --> 24:02.509
We're working together.

24:02.575 --> 24:03.843
That's never stopped you.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.452
Counselor, does your client
want to join us?

24:13.520 --> 24:14.887
I know he's
under house arrest,

24:14.954 --> 24:16.523
but I'm sure he's allowed
in the driveway.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.658
He's fine where he is.
Thank you.

24:18.725 --> 24:20.426
On the night Donatella Spear
was murdered--

24:20.493 --> 24:22.361
That has not been
proved, counselor.

24:22.428 --> 24:23.395
Please.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.731
On October 12 of last year,

24:24.797 --> 24:26.432
Miss Spear
arrived at 8:32 p.m.

24:26.499 --> 24:28.535
We have security data
and video.

24:28.601 --> 24:31.203
Someone exited the house,
no video, at 11:20 p.m.

24:31.270 --> 24:32.805
Mr. Holland and Miss Spear.

24:32.872 --> 24:35.307
And through the main vehicle
entrance 14 minutes later.

24:35.374 --> 24:36.643
He was driving her home

24:36.709 --> 24:38.578
after an evening
of consensual relations.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.680
He's a real gentleman.
She was already dead.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.882
No. Alive and well.

24:42.949 --> 24:46.986
14 minutes from the house
to the car and out the gate?

24:47.053 --> 24:48.721
Well, they'd had
a lot to drink.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.222
They'd done some Ecstasy.

24:50.289 --> 24:54.193
And they were still in a--
let's call it a frisky mood.

24:54.260 --> 24:55.595
Making out. Parking.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.229
Ever do it, Bosch,
in your youth?

24:57.296 --> 24:59.799
Maybe he was trying to put
a seat belt on a corpse.

24:59.866 --> 25:02.168
Someone-- Mr. Holland,
presumably--

25:02.234 --> 25:05.371
returned through that gate
at 1:52 a.m.

25:05.437 --> 25:07.206
Holland told us
he dropped off Spear

25:07.273 --> 25:09.508
at her house
around midnight,

25:09.576 --> 25:11.477
was back here by 12:30.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.880
That's nearly 90 minutes
unaccounted for.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.181
He was mistaken
about the time.

25:15.247 --> 25:16.248
He was under the influence.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.483
Bosch, who knows

25:17.550 --> 25:19.318
where the fuck
the time goes, right?

25:19.385 --> 25:20.887
They were fucked up.
Why would he lie

25:20.953 --> 25:22.822
about something
that's so easy to check?

25:22.889 --> 25:24.256
Because he's
an arrogant prick.

25:24.323 --> 25:25.324
You would know.

25:25.391 --> 25:27.459
Let me ask you
something, Rudy.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.995
You miss the job?

25:29.061 --> 25:31.030
Fuck, no.
Not for a second.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.565
I was never a lifer
like you.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.533
Oh, yeah, right.

25:34.601 --> 25:37.503
20 years of just
going through the motions.

25:37.570 --> 25:40.206
But pimping for celebrities?
That's low.

25:40.272 --> 25:42.709
That's low even for
a bottom feeder like you.

25:42.775 --> 25:45.111
Bosch, Bosch, Bosch.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.445
Look at you.

25:46.512 --> 25:48.848
Most guys would've
pulled the pin,

25:48.915 --> 25:53.485
take the pension,
lean back, enjoy life.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.121
Except you got none.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.726
When the department finally
puts you out to pasture,

25:59.792 --> 26:01.661
you'll eat your gun.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.611
40 minutes
door to door in traffic.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.880
That night,
that hour? Under ten.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.285
I've been here at night.

26:26.352 --> 26:27.687
It's dark dark.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.022
Private.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.090
He uses her keys,

26:31.157 --> 26:33.159
drags her body
up the stairs,

26:33.225 --> 26:34.093
stages a scene.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.695
There's your missing
90 minutes.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.163
He must have had help.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.765
Rudy Tafero's my bet.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.599
We've been at this
for 13 months.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.234
We don't have any evidence,

26:42.301 --> 26:43.435
any witnesses.

26:43.502 --> 26:46.005
Ran the phone records.
No calls.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.174
The place was wiped clean.
That's suspicious.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.241
It's all suspicious.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.343
And if Holland
were an ordinary mook

26:51.410 --> 26:52.578
with a public defender,

26:52.645 --> 26:54.213
he'd be begging
to cop a plea.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.315
But he's a semi-famous
film director

26:56.382 --> 26:57.817
with a high-priced
mouthpiece.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.085
Well, I still think
he'll plead.

26:59.151 --> 27:01.788
This is L.A. I got
two words for you.

27:01.854 --> 27:02.989
Don't say O.J.

27:03.055 --> 27:04.023
Robert Blake.

27:04.090 --> 27:04.957
Phil Spector.

27:05.024 --> 27:07.359
The exception
that proves the rule.

27:07.426 --> 27:10.429
So his story is:

27:10.496 --> 27:11.630
They have sex.

27:11.698 --> 27:13.132
He brings her home,
drops her.

27:13.199 --> 27:15.601
She's still hot.
She's still high on the X.

27:15.668 --> 27:17.236
He leaves. She wants
to get off again.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.906
Auto-erotic asphyxiation
is a male phenomenon.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.408
- There are cases of females--
- Very few.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.843
A few is all they need.

27:23.910 --> 27:26.578
That's why your testimony
is so important.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.314
Excuse me.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.984
- Jerry.
- Caught one, partner.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.253
- I'll text the address.
- On my way.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.123
I'll drop you at your car.

27:41.527 --> 27:43.796
Edge, what you got?

27:43.863 --> 27:45.264
White male, thirties.

27:45.331 --> 27:48.167
Looks like a single GSW.
Hard to tell.

27:48.234 --> 27:51.704
Head's like a baked apple.
No I.D.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.639
You glove up before
you went in, Powers?

27:53.706 --> 27:55.474
Yeah, I did.

27:55.541 --> 27:57.043
He's been cooking.

27:57.109 --> 27:59.311
Might want a hazmat
to go with those gloves.

28:11.490 --> 28:13.259
What was that about?

28:13.325 --> 28:14.626
Fucking Bosch.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.312
Jerry.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.783
"De Oppresso Liber."

28:37.683 --> 28:39.718
"Free the oppressed"?

28:40.753 --> 28:42.354
More like
"I was an oppressed man.

28:42.421 --> 28:43.756
Now I'm free."

28:45.825 --> 28:47.960
Oh, fuck this, Harry.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.764
This shit is hazardous
to human health.

28:51.831 --> 28:54.767
Coroner can get the body out,
call for a tow.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.702
Crims can process this
over at FSD.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.004
Air it the fuck out.

29:14.153 --> 29:14.921
Powers,

29:14.987 --> 29:16.455
you run the plates?

29:16.522 --> 29:17.990
I'm not a boot, Bosch.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.893
R-O comes back
to a male in Eagle Rock.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.162
Who called it in?

29:23.229 --> 29:24.797
Shopping cart lady
flagged us down.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.465
Door was open,
flapping in the breeze.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.000
Lock's busted.
Scene's fucked.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.335
People in and out,
stealing shit,

29:29.401 --> 29:31.904
- God knows what.
- This suit is toast.

29:31.971 --> 29:33.505
That looks kind of fresh.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.276
I know that tag.

29:37.343 --> 29:39.478
I might have a shake
on him. I'll look.

29:39.545 --> 29:40.779
It's a waste a time.

29:40.847 --> 29:42.448
It's a homeless
on homeless drug murder.

29:42.514 --> 29:43.883
There's no way
we clear this.

29:45.818 --> 29:48.087
Everybody counts,
or nobody counts.

29:48.154 --> 29:49.989
Written on the wall
at RHD.

29:50.056 --> 29:52.158
Doesn't mean
it always rings true
here on the streets.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.692
It should.

29:53.759 --> 29:54.726
Whatever.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.128
Come on, Harry.

29:59.065 --> 30:01.733
That tattoo.
It's an SF tattoo.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.202
Army, Special Forces.

30:03.269 --> 30:05.938
Special Forces, huh?
Like Green Beret?

30:06.005 --> 30:07.306
You got one, too?

30:07.373 --> 30:09.541
- Want to see it?
- I'll pass.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.553
Lieutenant.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.355
Captain.

30:23.422 --> 30:24.991
This thing is bullshit.

30:25.057 --> 30:26.425
I don't disagree.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.794
How are you feeling
about the verdict?

30:28.861 --> 30:30.362
Confident.

30:30.429 --> 30:31.630
From what I hear,

30:31.697 --> 30:33.499
the defense scored
some points off our people.

30:33.565 --> 30:36.335
Oh, it's just boilerplate
blame the police.

30:36.402 --> 30:39.571
Your lead detective
has a history.

30:39.638 --> 30:42.841
Uh, he has a history
of being accused.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.576
Where there's smoke.

30:44.643 --> 30:46.112
Not always.

30:46.178 --> 30:49.081
Sometimes it's just somebody
blowing it up your ass.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.719
Congrats on passing
the written.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.588
Oh, thanks.
Nervous about the orals.

30:56.655 --> 30:57.856
I don't see why.

30:57.924 --> 30:59.558
The orals should be
right up your alley.

31:00.626 --> 31:01.894
Excuse me?

31:13.639 --> 31:15.241
Here we go. That's my key.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.159
Morning, Juan.

31:38.597 --> 31:39.932
Homicide. He's out.

31:39.999 --> 31:42.234
I used to say it
as a joke, you know?

31:42.301 --> 31:43.235
Gentlemen.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.037
Lieutenant.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.805
Say what as a joke?
What's going on?

31:46.872 --> 31:48.874
Why the long faces?

31:48.941 --> 31:51.243
You know how I always
introduce Renee

31:51.310 --> 31:53.679
as the future
ex-Mrs. Johnson?

31:53.745 --> 31:55.514
I thought that was
funny, you know,

31:55.581 --> 31:57.849
given my matrimonial
history, and--

31:57.916 --> 32:00.086
Ah, Barrel, I am so sorry.

32:00.152 --> 32:01.720
What're ya gonna do?

32:01.787 --> 32:03.055
No retirement
for you, pal.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.390
Now you're stuck
with me.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.025
Fuck you.
I'm not sticking around

32:06.092 --> 32:07.859
just to keep you company.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.628
- Yeah, you are.
- No I'm not.

32:09.695 --> 32:10.829
You guys headed downtown?

32:10.896 --> 32:12.098
Yeah, just leaving.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.066
So is it good sign
or a bad sign?

32:14.133 --> 32:15.434
Who knows?

32:15.501 --> 32:16.602
Good sign.

32:16.668 --> 32:17.703
The jury's out two days?

32:17.769 --> 32:18.804
That's a bad sign.

32:18.870 --> 32:20.139
Do you need
to take some time?

32:20.206 --> 32:22.541
Eh, better to stay busy.
But thanks, Lieutenant.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.676
All right, if you need
anything, let me know.

32:24.743 --> 32:26.979
Boy, she's all right, Grace.

32:27.046 --> 32:28.847
Nobody like her.

32:28.914 --> 32:30.416
Fucking hate to see her
make Captain.

32:30.482 --> 32:31.383
Are you serious?

32:31.450 --> 32:33.085
No telling who we'd
end up with.

32:33.152 --> 32:34.386
I feel the same way.

32:34.453 --> 32:38.224
Anything we can do to,
uh, fuck up her chances?

32:38.290 --> 32:39.958
Just keep doing
what we're doing.

32:40.026 --> 32:42.261
Jesus, you guys.
Selfish assholes.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.063
I'm just joking.
I mean, you know,

32:44.130 --> 32:45.397
we wish her the best.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.333
You know, she deserves
to make Captain, right?

32:47.399 --> 32:49.501
Fuck that.
It'd be a calamity.

32:49.568 --> 32:50.969
I'll light a candle.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.439
I've been informed

32:53.505 --> 32:55.474
that the jury finds itself
still deadlocked

32:55.541 --> 32:57.943
and that further deliberations
would be fruitless.

32:58.010 --> 33:01.213
Therefore, on the single
count of Murder Two,

33:01.280 --> 33:03.949
The People of California
versus Veronica Allen,

33:04.016 --> 33:05.717
I declare a mistrial.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.186
No jeopardy attaches.

33:07.253 --> 33:08.954
The defendant's bond
is released.

33:09.021 --> 33:10.656
What does that mean,
no jeopardy?

33:10.722 --> 33:12.158
They can retry you.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.459
That's not fair.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.027
Well, don't worry
about it yet.

33:15.094 --> 33:16.228
Let's celebrate
this victory.

33:16.295 --> 33:18.330
This is a good thing,
Ronnie.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.800
This is not over.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.170
Detective.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.004
Seven to five
for acquittal?

33:26.072 --> 33:27.873
Why would the next
jury find you

33:27.939 --> 33:29.641
any more persuasive
than this one did?

33:29.708 --> 33:30.676
Trust me.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.511
The District Attorney
will weigh the odds

33:32.578 --> 33:35.047
- and cut his losses.
- The DA will re-try.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.415
I'll make it my mission.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.284
You are a dog with a bone.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.752
And you, Mrs. Allen,
are a liar and a murderer.

33:44.790 --> 33:47.793
You really do need
to get a life, detective.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.861
I still owe you that drink.

33:49.928 --> 33:51.730
Ring my bell any time.

33:53.065 --> 33:56.602
Ouch. Must be
oh so sore by now.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.309
Most of the usable prints
belong to a William Meadows.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.943
- Military?
- How'd you know?

34:05.010 --> 34:07.646
- The tattoos. How'd you know?
- Documents in the van

34:07.713 --> 34:09.681
pertaining to a Staff Sergeant
William Meadows

34:09.748 --> 34:11.650
and letters addressed
to a Billy Meadows.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.085
He the deceased?

34:13.152 --> 34:14.986
Waiting on the autopsy
for an I.D.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.688
They're super
backed up over there.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.657
He the owner of this
little slice of heaven?

34:18.724 --> 34:20.759
We think so.
Any prints
besides Meadows?

34:20.826 --> 34:22.361
- A multitude.
- Coppers said

34:22.428 --> 34:24.396
the place was ransacked
after he died.

34:24.463 --> 34:25.797
Homeless
on homeless, right?

34:25.864 --> 34:27.299
Most likely.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.175
The people's
case was flimsy,

34:36.242 --> 34:37.476
and the jury agreed.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.111
Bet it was the men
voted to acquit.

34:39.178 --> 34:42.248
I hear you, brother.
I'd acquit that any day.

34:42.314 --> 34:43.582
They heard the testimony.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.851
They found Mrs. Allen
more compelling...

34:45.917 --> 34:47.286
You guys do look shifty,

34:47.353 --> 34:49.688
like a couple
of salt-and-pepper
shakedown artists

34:49.755 --> 34:50.989
preying on lonely widows.

34:51.056 --> 34:52.824
- Shake this.
- Eh.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.460
Well, we're disappointed.

34:54.526 --> 34:56.862
But this office will study
the events of this trial

34:56.928 --> 34:59.531
before we decide whether
to retry Mrs. Allen.

34:59.598 --> 35:03.235
Whether to retry?
Are you kidding me?

35:03.302 --> 35:05.237
That chickenshit.

35:06.505 --> 35:07.773
Excuse me.

35:20.051 --> 35:22.688
Mr. District Attorney.
Benitez.

35:22.754 --> 35:23.689
Bosch.

35:23.755 --> 35:25.391
Anita was just
bringing me up to speed

35:25.457 --> 35:26.858
on the Holland case--

35:28.894 --> 35:31.297
All right,
I have to tell you.

35:31.363 --> 35:33.432
After what happened
today, I'm concerned.

35:33.499 --> 35:34.366
Don't be.

35:34.433 --> 35:35.701
And since
you brought it up,

35:35.767 --> 35:36.502
The Allen case,

35:36.568 --> 35:38.103
which way
are you leaning?

35:38.170 --> 35:40.071
- Oh, I've made up my mind.
- Mm-hmm.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.241
This office
will not file new charges

35:42.308 --> 35:43.642
against Veronica Allen.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.143
Hold on a minute.
You're shitting me.

35:45.211 --> 35:46.345
Honey Chandler has painted

35:46.412 --> 35:48.380
an indelible portrait
of you, detective,

35:48.447 --> 35:50.449
one that cannot be erased:

35:50.516 --> 35:52.551
that you can't be trusted,

35:52.618 --> 35:54.253
That you'll do anything,
say anything,

35:54.320 --> 35:55.521
cut any corner, to win.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.022
That's bullshit.
I don't do that.

35:57.088 --> 35:58.757
You have that reputation,
detective,

35:58.824 --> 36:00.359
deserved or not.

36:00.426 --> 36:02.761
Between you and Mrs. Allen
and credibility,

36:02.828 --> 36:04.263
it's no contest.

36:04.330 --> 36:05.731
So, no. I won't refile.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.433
Now if you'll excuse us,
we've got business.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.268
Now, you listen to me,
you smug son of a bitch.

36:09.335 --> 36:10.936
You don't want to pursue this.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.771
You don't want to do your job.

36:12.838 --> 36:15.874
This is payback. This is
your vendetta with Irving.

36:15.941 --> 36:17.576
Harry--

36:17.643 --> 36:19.878
Harry, stop.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.076
Shit.

36:51.142 --> 36:52.511
Dad?

36:52.578 --> 36:53.345
Yeah.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.213
You going to bed?

36:55.281 --> 36:58.016
Yeah.

36:58.083 --> 36:59.718
You finish your homework?

37:02.588 --> 37:04.155
Dad, you're
on the internet.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.258
I'm just doing
something for work.

37:06.325 --> 37:08.494
No, I mean you.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.061
You're on the internet.

37:10.128 --> 37:11.563
You don't want
to pursue this.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.198
You don't want
to do your job.

37:13.265 --> 37:16.335
This is payback. This is
your vendetta with Irving.

37:16.402 --> 37:18.470
Harry. Harry, stop.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.377
You look like you
wanted to kill him.

37:26.778 --> 37:27.746
We had an argument.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.881
I shouldn't
have lost my temper.

37:31.149 --> 37:32.318
Okay?

37:32.384 --> 37:34.019
Well, you're lucky.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.722
It only got,
like, 37 retweets.

37:38.490 --> 37:41.293
You have to be really
careful these days, Dad.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.395
Literally
everything is on camera.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.163
Ain't it the truth.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.666
Okay, honey.
Good night.

37:47.733 --> 37:48.734
Good night.

37:59.711 --> 38:00.879
Ah, shit.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.551
50 bucks.

38:07.753 --> 38:08.787
Deal.

38:08.854 --> 38:09.988
Get in.

38:25.537 --> 38:28.206
This class of recruits

38:28.273 --> 38:30.376
exemplifies the core values

38:30.442 --> 38:32.611
of the Los Angeles
Police Department:

38:34.245 --> 38:36.648
service to the community,

38:36.715 --> 38:39.050
reverence for the law,

38:39.117 --> 38:43.088
integrity. leadership,

38:43.154 --> 38:45.090
respect for all people.

38:47.393 --> 38:50.128
Keep these values in mind,

38:50.195 --> 38:53.098
and strive to uphold them
throughout your careers.

38:56.802 --> 39:00.005
It is a privilege to be
a Los Angeles police officer.

39:01.607 --> 39:05.010
It is an honor
to wear this uniform.

39:06.878 --> 39:12.484
And with it comes
enormous responsibility

39:12.551 --> 39:13.819
and an awesome commitment

39:13.885 --> 39:16.788
to protect this city
and its citizens...

39:19.791 --> 39:21.893
with your lives if necessary.

39:23.395 --> 39:25.330
Not so many years ago,

39:25.397 --> 39:27.499
on a day like this...

39:29.735 --> 39:31.603
I was in the audience.

39:37.776 --> 39:40.111
My son graduated that day.

39:41.747 --> 39:43.682
And I could not
have been prouder.

39:47.519 --> 39:50.956
My son honored
that commitment.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.726
He made the ultimate
sacrifice.

39:56.394 --> 40:00.899
So I honor his memory every
time I put on this uniform,

40:00.966 --> 40:05.170
just as you honor
the memory of every officer

40:05.236 --> 40:08.474
who has given his or her life
in the line of duty.

40:09.675 --> 40:11.643
Wear it with pride.

40:12.844 --> 40:15.447
Respect what it represents:

40:17.015 --> 40:20.452
to serve and protect
the citizens of Los Angeles.

40:20.519 --> 40:23.188
Class 516.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.423
A-ten-hut!

40:26.625 --> 40:29.661
Class 516,

40:29.728 --> 40:33.599
on behalf of the Mayor
and the City of Los Angeles,

40:33.665 --> 40:36.902
welcome to the Los Angeles
Police Department.

40:57.222 --> 40:59.758
Smile, man, smile.

41:01.493 --> 41:03.495
A happy day.
Well done, Irv.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.631
Thank you, Brad.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.465
How goes the search?

41:07.533 --> 41:08.834
The board's split.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.936
Do we pick an
insider like you?

41:11.002 --> 41:12.003
Go outside,

41:12.070 --> 41:13.805
someone with no ties
to the department?

41:13.872 --> 41:15.306
No potential
conflicts of interest?

41:15.373 --> 41:18.143
Maybe it's time for
the first female chief,

41:18.209 --> 41:19.878
the first Latino.

41:19.945 --> 41:21.880
You could
make it easy on us.

41:21.947 --> 41:23.114
Stick around.

41:23.181 --> 41:24.950
Put us out of our misery.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.185
Look, I've already
told the mayor.

41:27.252 --> 41:30.856
I know, I know. You're
a stubborn son of a bitch.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.124
So I hear.

41:33.191 --> 41:34.359
Talk him into it?

41:34.425 --> 41:35.994
What do you think,
Hector?

41:36.061 --> 41:39.364
That was moving, Irv,
inspirational,

41:39.430 --> 41:40.999
first-rate. I mean it.

41:41.066 --> 41:43.034
You're held in high regard
by your troops.

41:43.101 --> 41:45.303
- Thank you.
- Mr. Mayor.

41:45.370 --> 41:48.339
- Bradley.
- Richard.

41:48.406 --> 41:51.342
Congratulations, Chief.

41:51.409 --> 41:53.545
Um, a word?

41:54.980 --> 41:56.147
Gentlemen.

42:02.754 --> 42:06.992
You need to put your attack
dog back on his leash.

42:18.937 --> 42:21.106
Come in.

42:21.172 --> 42:22.440
Captain?

42:22.507 --> 42:25.343
I just had a call
from Chief Irving.

42:25.410 --> 42:27.412
It's about Bosch.

42:27.478 --> 42:28.980
I have something
to show you.

42:32.984 --> 42:35.220
I thought he was
more chipper lately,

42:35.286 --> 42:37.989
- more hopeful.
- Probably just high.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.425
Mr. Meadows, was
your son in treatment?

42:40.491 --> 42:42.894
NA? AA?

42:42.961 --> 42:44.362
Any veteran's groups?

42:44.429 --> 42:45.697
He'd tell you he was.

42:45.764 --> 42:48.533
When he first got back he was.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.068
Did he have a cell phone?

42:50.135 --> 42:53.171
One after another.
What do they call them?

42:53.238 --> 42:54.505
Burners.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.474
Yeah, always
a different number.

42:56.541 --> 42:58.343
If we can get a hold
of the latest.

42:58.409 --> 43:00.378
We're like to talk to anyone
who might have seen him

43:00.445 --> 43:02.480
or spoken to him recently.

43:02.547 --> 43:04.582
Friends, girlfriends.

43:04.650 --> 43:06.918
Ohh.
None that we knew of.

43:06.985 --> 43:11.089
Army buds? Anybody he might
have kept in touch with?

43:12.190 --> 43:13.692
I think he pretty much

43:13.759 --> 43:15.727
lost touch with everyone.

43:15.794 --> 43:17.896
Did you see him often?

43:19.130 --> 43:20.298
First of the month.

43:20.365 --> 43:21.900
Pick up his check.

43:23.068 --> 43:24.770
That was the deal.
I'd cash it for him,

43:24.836 --> 43:26.171
and that was that.

43:26.237 --> 43:28.940
No. Not just.

43:29.007 --> 43:32.610
A meal, a change of clothes,

43:32.678 --> 43:34.713
hot shower.

43:34.780 --> 43:37.082
I'd do his wash for him.

43:38.316 --> 43:40.686
Some men never grow up.

43:42.387 --> 43:44.189
You ever visit him?

43:44.255 --> 43:46.391
He wouldn't ever tell us
where he was living.

43:46.457 --> 43:49.327
He was ashamed, Hal.

44:05.310 --> 44:08.646
That was just before he
deployed the first time.

44:08.714 --> 44:10.581
The first time?

44:10.648 --> 44:14.352
Once to Iraq,
twice to Afghanistan.

44:14.419 --> 44:16.121
A Green Beret.

44:16.187 --> 44:19.190
That's a real accomplishment,
Mrs. Meadows.

44:20.491 --> 44:21.893
We were proud of him.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.494
I'm sure you are.

44:23.561 --> 44:27.332
It wrecked him,
this damn war.

44:27.398 --> 44:31.036
He had no end of troubles
when he finally came home.

44:32.704 --> 44:35.273
Now this.

44:35.340 --> 44:37.142
Take your time.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.996
I'll tell you
what isn't here:

44:58.063 --> 44:59.530
his kit.

44:59.597 --> 45:01.599
Anything to do
with his service.

45:01.666 --> 45:04.169
No unit patches,
no challenge coins,

45:04.235 --> 45:08.439
no souvenirs,
no uniform, no beret.

45:08.506 --> 45:10.175
Just this one picture.

45:11.209 --> 45:13.845
He kept his things at The Bin.

45:13.912 --> 45:15.881
Downtown?
On Fifth Street?

45:15.947 --> 45:18.549
Yeah, his important
things from the army.

45:18.616 --> 45:20.418
The RV wasn't safe.

45:20.485 --> 45:22.053
Why didn't he
keep them here?

45:23.889 --> 45:26.491
He said he didn't
want to infect us.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.395
Thank you.

45:35.533 --> 45:37.302
I'll write the warrant.

45:40.605 --> 45:41.773
- Hey.
- Oh.

45:41.840 --> 45:43.274
Sorry I'm late.

45:43.341 --> 45:46.377
Traffic coming from
the Westside was murder,

45:46.444 --> 45:47.545
miserable.

45:47.612 --> 45:48.679
We made ramen.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.581
- I see that.
- Want some?

45:50.648 --> 45:52.851
It's good. Salty. Slurpy.

45:52.918 --> 45:54.185
Naw, I'm not hungry,

45:54.252 --> 45:55.854
but I'm gonna grab a beer
and come join you.

46:01.192 --> 46:02.994
So, Grace,

46:03.061 --> 46:04.529
what brings you by?

46:04.595 --> 46:07.565
Mm, just checking
on you two,

46:07.632 --> 46:09.334
making sure you're
getting along.

46:09.400 --> 46:11.302
- We're doing good. Maddie?
- Excellent.

46:11.369 --> 46:12.770
Harry's gonna teach me
how to drive.

46:12.838 --> 46:14.172
Ooh. Brave man.

46:14.239 --> 46:15.073
We'll see.

46:15.140 --> 46:16.307
Maddie was just telling me

46:16.374 --> 46:17.843
about Eleanor and Reggie
in Hong Kong.

46:17.909 --> 46:19.544
Doing well,
by all accounts.

46:19.610 --> 46:21.012
Yeah,
but you must miss them.

46:21.079 --> 46:23.681
A lot. They're planning
to come home for Christmas.

46:23.748 --> 46:26.184
They are?
Good to know.

46:26.251 --> 46:28.019
Grace, seconds?

46:28.086 --> 46:29.787
No, I'm good, thanks.
It was delish.

46:29.855 --> 46:31.122
Thanks.

46:36.527 --> 46:37.528
I have homework.

46:37.595 --> 46:38.763
Okay.

46:38.830 --> 46:40.098
It's good to see you,
Maddie.

46:40.165 --> 46:41.799
You, too.
Tell Lisa I said hi.

46:41.867 --> 46:43.101
Will do.

46:52.944 --> 46:55.480
Your little outburst
with the DA.

46:55.546 --> 46:57.348
It's gone viral.

46:57.415 --> 47:00.351
IA is going to file
a 128 against you.

47:00.418 --> 47:01.719
What a pain in the ass.

47:01.786 --> 47:03.221
Do me a favor,
take their call.

47:03.288 --> 47:04.289
Yeah, yeah.

47:05.390 --> 47:06.524
No, I mean it.

47:06.591 --> 47:08.259
Lewis is
on the war path.

47:08.326 --> 47:09.427
I said yeah.

47:13.764 --> 47:15.033
I'm worried
about you, Harry.

47:15.100 --> 47:16.001
Don't be. I'm fine.

47:16.067 --> 47:17.302
I don't think you are.

47:17.368 --> 47:18.503
I'm tired is all.

47:18.569 --> 47:19.737
I'm not sleeping.

47:19.804 --> 47:21.973
All right, well,
take some vacation days.

47:22.040 --> 47:23.374
When Maddie
finishes school.

47:31.216 --> 47:33.251
You know what?
Fuck this.

47:33.318 --> 47:36.054
This is me, Grace, asking.

47:36.121 --> 47:38.423
What the fuck
is eating you, Harry?

47:39.590 --> 47:41.226
I thought that closing
your mother's murder

47:41.292 --> 47:42.827
would bring you some peace.

47:42.894 --> 47:44.362
Instead, it's made you
more miserable.

47:44.429 --> 47:45.730
Peace?

47:45.796 --> 47:47.698
That's a load of shit.

47:47.765 --> 47:49.300
Her murderer
got away with it,

47:49.367 --> 47:51.469
and my department
helped him do it.

47:51.536 --> 47:52.603
Things have changed.

47:52.670 --> 47:53.838
It's not the same
department.

47:53.905 --> 47:55.073
It's the same world.

47:55.140 --> 47:58.743
You need to get over it

47:58.809 --> 48:01.312
and get yourself right.

48:26.671 --> 48:28.039
Just wanted
to say good night.

48:29.674 --> 48:31.142
Good night, honey.

48:33.911 --> 48:34.980
You okay?

48:35.046 --> 48:36.481
Yeah, I'm fine.

48:38.316 --> 48:40.818
What did Grace want,
really?

48:40.885 --> 48:43.621
Just wanted
to make sure we're okay.

48:45.056 --> 48:46.024
We are, right?

48:46.091 --> 48:48.326
Of course. Absolutely.

48:48.393 --> 48:49.694
Good.

48:53.498 --> 48:54.865
- Good night.
- Good night.

48:54.932 --> 48:56.567
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

49:26.331 --> 49:27.432
Aah!

49:27.498 --> 49:28.633
No!

50:38.636 --> 50:40.405
Who the fuck are you?
