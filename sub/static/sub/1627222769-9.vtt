WEBVTT

00:25.992 --> 00:27.527
Everything seems
to be in order.

00:32.999 --> 00:36.169
May I ask, Master Wayne,

00:36.236 --> 00:38.104
are you completely sure
about what you're doing?

00:42.008 --> 00:44.077
Yes, Charles. I am.

00:48.014 --> 00:48.915
Very well.

01:05.632 --> 01:08.134
Will you be requiring
anything more tonight, sir?

01:09.736 --> 01:10.737
I will not.

01:12.539 --> 01:13.540
Thank you

01:14.874 --> 01:16.276
for everything you've done.

01:19.446 --> 01:20.914
Good night, Master Wayne.

01:23.550 --> 01:24.584
Good bye, Charles.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.343
And again. Head.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.512
Just what exactly were
you trying to do in there?

02:59.579 --> 03:00.480
Left.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.215
- I was trying...
- Right.

03:03.550 --> 03:04.884
...to bring Donna back.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.085
Stubborn and willful.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.987
I was just like you
at your age.

03:08.054 --> 03:09.556
Legs.

03:09.656 --> 03:11.057
You call
this place paradise,

03:11.157 --> 03:12.525
but I don't get it.

03:12.592 --> 03:15.061
I've been here for months,
and all I do is train.

03:15.161 --> 03:16.896
And you know I can do more.

03:22.001 --> 03:24.103
You're here to learn our ways.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.606
Certain things are
not achieved by force.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.008
The ritual we do in the temple
requires patience

03:29.075 --> 03:30.243
and dedication.

03:30.343 --> 03:32.011
Your ritual's not working.

03:35.081 --> 03:35.949
Top!

03:37.083 --> 03:39.352
It also requires humility.

03:41.688 --> 03:45.091
I apologize
for my words, Lydia.

03:45.191 --> 03:46.726
Proceed with your training.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.629
Your timing could
use some work, too.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.298
I hate this island.

03:54.968 --> 03:55.969
Okay.

03:56.936 --> 03:57.971
- Okay.
- Again.

03:59.372 --> 04:00.373
Head.

04:39.579 --> 04:40.613
Timothy Drake?

04:41.848 --> 04:42.815
Yeah.

04:47.920 --> 04:48.988
So...

04:49.922 --> 04:53.326
You're Timothy S. Drake?

04:55.428 --> 04:56.696
Can you...

04:56.796 --> 04:59.332
Can you tell me
where we're going?

04:59.432 --> 05:01.000
I'm afraid I can't.

05:02.201 --> 05:03.670
I'm sorry, I...

05:06.773 --> 05:08.174
I know this'll sound weird,

05:08.274 --> 05:12.612
but I can't quite remember
why I'm here.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.049
It's totally normal.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.483
Nothing to worry about.

05:18.284 --> 05:19.619
It can take a while.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.621
Look, man.

05:22.955 --> 05:24.524
You're gonna have to
give me some answers,

05:24.624 --> 05:27.660
'cause I don't know where I am
or how I got here, so...

05:28.795 --> 05:29.862
I understand.

05:30.963 --> 05:31.964
Just come with me.

05:33.299 --> 05:34.133
What?

05:35.635 --> 05:38.805
We're almost at your stop.

05:39.872 --> 05:40.707
Hand off!

06:17.243 --> 06:20.346
- Hey.

06:20.413 --> 06:22.849
- Are you all right?
- Where the hell am I?

06:26.352 --> 06:29.589
This is the next place.

06:31.190 --> 06:32.125
You mean...

06:32.725 --> 06:34.193
I'm dead?

06:34.260 --> 06:35.461
We all are.

06:36.929 --> 06:38.965
I know it can be
a lot to take in.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.069
My name's Donna.

06:44.370 --> 06:45.304
Tim.

06:46.539 --> 06:47.607
Timothy?

07:02.655 --> 07:03.756
They're looking for you.

07:03.823 --> 07:05.258
Look, Ma'am--
- Ma'am?

07:05.324 --> 07:07.293
Maybe you're dead,
but not me.

07:08.728 --> 07:09.929
Are you crazy?

07:22.442 --> 07:23.409
Damn it.

08:12.358 --> 08:13.659
Come on, Donna.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.128
Come back to me.

08:24.537 --> 08:25.505
Come on.

08:26.305 --> 08:27.373
Come on.

09:00.439 --> 09:01.340
Wait!

09:03.609 --> 09:04.544
Okay.

09:06.512 --> 09:07.747
Where are you going?

09:10.950 --> 09:11.951
Back.

09:12.852 --> 09:13.853
Back where?

09:14.787 --> 09:16.355
Home.

09:16.422 --> 09:19.392
Well, you better pace yourself,
'cause you got a ways to go.

09:19.458 --> 09:20.927
So what,
do you work for them?

09:21.027 --> 09:22.595
Who? The train people? No.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.363
Then why are you following me?

09:24.430 --> 09:25.765
Because you look scared.

09:27.533 --> 09:28.768
We should probably
head back now.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.403
Not gonna happen.

09:30.469 --> 09:34.106
Look, I was freaked out
when I woke up, too, okay?

09:34.206 --> 09:37.276
It can be a lot to
wrap your head around.

09:37.376 --> 09:40.313
It's kind of the point of life
and death, though, right?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.882
Move forward, not back.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.819
Which is why it's a train?

09:46.919 --> 09:48.487
Yeah, the metaphor
is not subtle,

09:48.588 --> 09:49.989
but it nails the point.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.125
Do you remember anything?

09:54.493 --> 09:55.795
How you died or...

09:57.330 --> 09:58.631
No.

09:59.565 --> 10:01.667
Just know I gotta go home.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.669
How are you gonna
do that, huh?

10:03.769 --> 10:05.137
Order a Lyft?

10:05.237 --> 10:07.106
Let me tell you,
the service down here sucks.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.174
Hey!

10:08.274 --> 10:09.609
You wanna go back
to the train, go.

10:09.675 --> 10:10.910
I didn't ask for your help.

10:22.488 --> 10:23.656
Who are these guys?

10:23.756 --> 10:25.124
I have no idea.

10:27.426 --> 10:29.028
Hey, are you guys
from the train?

10:30.262 --> 10:31.497
We were just getting
some fresh air,

10:31.597 --> 10:33.499
so if there's a problem...

10:47.480 --> 10:48.547
Do you feel that?

10:53.319 --> 10:54.887
Get behind me.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.192
Run!

11:10.036 --> 11:12.004
Get in!
- Do it.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.384
Oh, my God.

11:25.484 --> 11:28.054
Looks like we got some
catching up to do.

11:51.610 --> 11:54.280
In this hour,
as in all hours,

11:54.380 --> 11:55.915
we seek balance.

11:56.015 --> 11:58.884
We request
the blessings of Artemis

11:58.951 --> 12:01.020
as we begin our endeavor.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.256
Given.

12:04.356 --> 12:07.626
The ritual of Ordigi
has been disrupted.

12:08.360 --> 12:09.562
Given.

12:09.628 --> 12:12.398
The act of blasphemy
has caused an imbalance.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.632
Given.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.368
The act was committed
by Rachel Roth.

12:18.204 --> 12:19.371
Implied.

12:19.438 --> 12:22.541
The transmigration of
Donna Troy's soul

12:22.608 --> 12:24.310
has been corrupted.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.979
Any hope for resurrection
now jeopardized.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.782
Wait, you don't know that...

12:29.882 --> 12:33.152
- Sorry.
Therefore determined.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.987
Balance must be restored

12:35.087 --> 12:36.889
through the appropriate result.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.491
I request that
the council hold that

12:38.591 --> 12:40.626
Rachel is a visitor
to our island

12:40.726 --> 12:42.795
and still largely ignorant
of our ways.

12:42.895 --> 12:44.964
Willfully ignorant.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.669
May I submit initial result?

12:52.338 --> 12:53.672
Result.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.308
I will oversee an increase
in task and training,

12:56.408 --> 12:58.811
as well as initiate
a curriculum in the culture

12:58.911 --> 13:00.513
and rituals of our island.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.348
Insufficient result.

13:03.749 --> 13:05.084
Secondary result.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.585
I propose that
Rachel be allowed--

13:06.652 --> 13:08.454
I wasn't committing blasphemy.

13:09.755 --> 13:11.824
You have no proof that
what I did hurt Donna

13:11.924 --> 13:14.293
or her soul's transmigration.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.163
Please, Rachel...

13:17.263 --> 13:19.598
I just... I don't see why
I should be punished

13:19.665 --> 13:22.535
because you all are
afraid of me and my powers.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.337
I see why Donna left
this place.

13:25.437 --> 13:26.705
I don't blame her.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.341
She was a hero,

13:29.441 --> 13:31.310
and you all are cowards.

13:36.782 --> 13:38.384
May I request that
the council allow me

13:38.484 --> 13:40.052
to speak privately
with Rachel.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.354
This endeavor has concluded.

13:42.454 --> 13:45.124
I will administer
result myself.

14:09.648 --> 14:10.749
I think we lost them.

14:13.419 --> 14:14.687
Who's the kid?

14:14.753 --> 14:17.223
I don't really know.
His name is Tim.

14:17.323 --> 14:18.557
Is he okay?

14:18.657 --> 14:20.693
He's still in the fog,
you know.

14:20.759 --> 14:22.094
Oh, yeah.

14:22.194 --> 14:25.731
It took me forever
before I felt halfway normal.

14:25.831 --> 14:28.067
Hey, what were you doing
back there in the woods?

14:28.167 --> 14:30.703
Um, he jumped off the train,

14:30.769 --> 14:32.705
freaked out or something,
so I followed him.

14:32.771 --> 14:35.374
What the fuck were
those things back there?

14:35.441 --> 14:37.409
Ghouls.

14:37.509 --> 14:41.447
If you get off the train
before your "destination,"

14:41.547 --> 14:43.249
you end up out here.

14:43.349 --> 14:46.719
It's kind of a no man's land.
Your soul's up for grabs.

14:46.785 --> 14:49.922
Ghouls will steal your soul
if they get close enough,

14:50.022 --> 14:53.225
and if they get you,
they take you down.

14:53.292 --> 14:54.693
All the way down.

14:54.760 --> 14:55.861
To Hades.

14:55.928 --> 14:57.596
And you don't
come back from that.

15:00.699 --> 15:04.603
So, should we talk about
the elephant in the room?

15:04.703 --> 15:05.771
What elephant?

15:05.871 --> 15:06.972
Well, I don't know.
You're dead!

15:07.539 --> 15:08.307
Oh.

15:09.975 --> 15:11.143
That elephant.

15:11.944 --> 15:13.445
Yeah.

15:13.545 --> 15:14.914
What happened?

15:14.980 --> 15:17.816
Jason. Fucking. Todd.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.119
- What?
- I know, right?

15:20.219 --> 15:23.122
I mean, Jason's always been
fucked up and had problems,

15:23.222 --> 15:24.924
but why would he kill you?

15:24.990 --> 15:27.259
Oh, you think I know?

15:27.326 --> 15:30.296
He started taking
some fucked-out drug,

15:30.396 --> 15:34.266
started dressing like
Deathstroke meets the Gimp,

15:34.333 --> 15:37.937
calls himself Red Hood,
whatever that means.

15:38.003 --> 15:40.839
Next thing you know
he went batshit nuts,

15:40.940 --> 15:42.975
strapped a bomb
to my chest and...

15:47.579 --> 15:48.981
Just wanna make sure
you're still kicking
back there, kid.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.282
Asshole.
- He's with us.

15:50.349 --> 15:52.017
You're good.
Take a chill pill.

15:53.352 --> 15:57.156
Anyway, classic
Gotham bullshit.

15:57.256 --> 15:59.124
My God. I'm so sorry, Hank.

15:59.758 --> 16:00.926
Yeah.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.428
Oh, my God. Dawn.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.997
She must be devastated.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.499
She better be.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.049
Malcolm?

16:26.618 --> 16:27.720
You on your own?

16:27.820 --> 16:29.855
Uh, my friends and I had
a little run in,

16:29.955 --> 16:32.458
but we left them on the road.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.227
Welcome to
the Twilight Owl.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.363
My name is Malcolm.
Pleased to meet you.

16:37.463 --> 16:38.564
Now you folks look like

16:38.664 --> 16:39.832
you can use
a little pick-me-up.

16:39.898 --> 16:41.800
This one's gonna
need some food.

16:43.702 --> 16:45.204
We need to talk.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.538
Grab a table.

16:46.638 --> 16:48.574
Come on.
Let's get you fixed up.

16:50.142 --> 16:51.377
I gotta get home.

16:52.978 --> 16:53.879
Yeah.

16:54.813 --> 16:57.483
Okay, kid. You and me both.

16:58.650 --> 17:00.085
Go with Malcolm, grab a bite.

17:02.154 --> 17:03.022
Hey.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.258
We're gonna figure
this out, okay?

17:16.735 --> 17:18.604
What is this place?

17:18.704 --> 17:21.040
I kinda think of this
as my home base.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.776
Classy for a guy
who thinks flushing's optional.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.244
Thank you.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.780
I can gather my thoughts here,
get the lay of the land,

17:27.880 --> 17:29.415
pick up intel.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.050
Help people out when I can.

17:31.717 --> 17:32.918
What people?

17:33.018 --> 17:34.219
Ah, you don't think
you're the only one

17:34.286 --> 17:36.455
who jumped off that train, huh?

17:36.555 --> 17:39.258
Lot of people get cold feet
on the way to the next place.

17:40.359 --> 17:41.693
Cheers.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.262
I thought you weren't drinking.

17:43.362 --> 17:44.630
Oh, I wasn't.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.465
Then I died, so I figured out
what the hell?

17:46.565 --> 17:48.100
- Might as well live a little.

17:51.537 --> 17:54.106
Look, the important thing is,
we found each other.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.275
That can't be a coincidence.

17:56.375 --> 17:57.576
I'll give you that.

17:57.643 --> 17:59.745
This all does seem
pretty strange.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.147
Yeah.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.150
Maybe it's all happening
for a reason.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.919
You said the kid
wants to go back, huh?

18:06.985 --> 18:08.287
Yeah.

18:08.387 --> 18:09.988
I tried explaining
it's not really an option,

18:10.089 --> 18:12.758
but he's not ready to hear it.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.293
Who says it's not an option?

18:15.227 --> 18:16.795
All of human history.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.135
I may have found a loophole.

18:23.235 --> 18:26.305
Hank, this is the afterlife.
There are no loopholes.

18:26.405 --> 18:27.573
When our tickets got punched,

18:27.639 --> 18:29.241
they were one way,
not round trip.

18:30.742 --> 18:32.111
Maybe it's just a rumor,

18:33.579 --> 18:35.013
there's supposed
to be a bridge.

18:35.814 --> 18:37.316
A bridge?

18:37.416 --> 18:38.183
Back to Earth?

18:38.283 --> 18:39.952
That's what I heard.

18:40.018 --> 18:42.821
I was scouting it out
when I found you.

18:42.921 --> 18:44.456
That's totally insane.

18:44.523 --> 18:45.958
And all of this isn't?

18:48.127 --> 18:50.929
Your timing couldn't
be more perfect.

18:50.996 --> 18:53.265
The Titans were having
real problems when I died.

18:53.332 --> 18:55.134
Jason's coming after them, too.

18:56.502 --> 18:57.703
They can use my help

18:57.803 --> 18:59.104
and they could
definitely use yours.

19:00.606 --> 19:03.041
Now we can go back together.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.277
That's why all this
is happening, Donna.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.881
A second chance.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.050
What's wrong?

19:15.521 --> 19:16.889
I don't wanna go back.

19:19.791 --> 19:20.859
So, this is it?

19:20.959 --> 19:22.394
You're locking me in my room?

19:22.494 --> 19:23.862
'Cause that doesn't
really seem like a punishment.

19:23.962 --> 19:25.364
I thought you'd
throw me in a pit,

19:25.464 --> 19:28.033
or make me fight sharks
or something.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.169
Have you ever considered
speaking less?

19:40.179 --> 19:42.748
This is Pnevma.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.751
It has existed here
on the island

19:45.851 --> 19:47.853
since before history.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.421
Before memory.

19:49.521 --> 19:53.392
The legend is that it was built
by a hero of our tribe,

19:53.492 --> 19:54.893
long forgotten now,

19:54.993 --> 19:56.828
to represent the human soul.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.068
Why would you do that?

20:03.168 --> 20:04.403
This is your result.

20:04.503 --> 20:07.039
Designed by me
to restore balance

20:07.105 --> 20:09.074
where balance has been lost.

20:09.174 --> 20:12.878
Rebuild Pnevma
in whatever way you can,

20:12.945 --> 20:14.413
using every stone.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.349
Is that all?

20:17.416 --> 20:18.850
It is.

20:18.917 --> 20:22.187
Well, it doesn't seem so bad.

20:23.689 --> 20:27.526
It is nothing more than
the task of building a soul.

20:31.296 --> 20:33.432
What are you talking about?
We have to go back.

20:33.532 --> 20:36.101
You don't even know if we can.
And even if we could--

20:36.201 --> 20:37.903
You're telling me you wouldn't
jump at the chance

20:37.970 --> 20:40.205
to go back down there
and hand Jason his ass?

20:40.272 --> 20:41.573
Is that what this is about?

20:41.640 --> 20:42.874
Revenge?

20:42.941 --> 20:44.610
You're goddamn right
it's about revenge!

20:44.710 --> 20:46.878
That little fucker blew me up.

20:46.945 --> 20:49.147
I think we're supposed
to let that go, Hank.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.820
Donna Troy is
lecturing me about

20:54.920 --> 20:56.288
letting stuff go?

20:56.388 --> 20:58.824
Did you let stuff go
when Deathstroke killed Garth?

21:00.225 --> 21:01.893
I didn't fucking think so.

21:03.128 --> 21:04.329
The hell happened to you?

21:04.429 --> 21:05.497
I died.

21:06.465 --> 21:07.966
And so did you.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.168
It sucks,
but it is what it is.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.503
I had a lot of road left.

21:11.603 --> 21:12.838
And so did I!

21:14.840 --> 21:17.976
You think I'm happy
about how I went out?

21:18.076 --> 21:22.281
I didn't save the planet
from some asteroid.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.483
I died at a carnival, Hank.

21:25.684 --> 21:26.818
A carnival.

21:32.424 --> 21:35.327
Well, when you put it
like that...

21:35.427 --> 21:37.696
I spent a lot of time
struggling with it,

21:38.497 --> 21:39.665
agonizing over it,

21:39.765 --> 21:42.301
trying to make
some sense of it.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.670
You know what I realized?

21:46.672 --> 21:48.206
It doesn't make sense.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.611
You saved
someone's life.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.981
You can sure as hell bet
it made sense to them.

21:56.048 --> 21:59.851
But I shouldn't have
had to die to do it.

21:59.951 --> 22:03.188
We spent our whole lives
on a hamster wheel,

22:03.288 --> 22:05.557
running hard
but not making much ground.

22:06.958 --> 22:09.961
We saved people, I know that.

22:10.028 --> 22:11.730
But it didn't change anything.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.502
So when I was sitting
on that train,

22:18.403 --> 22:19.905
I made a decision.

22:21.306 --> 22:23.308
I want to move forward,

22:23.375 --> 22:25.410
see what's next for
Donna Troy.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.881
Who knows, maybe I'll
come back as a clown fish.

22:29.981 --> 22:32.017
- At least that makes sense.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.329
Fucking hell!

22:47.165 --> 22:48.266
No!

22:52.037 --> 22:53.405
Malcolm, no.

23:35.881 --> 23:38.417
So why do guys train
so much?

23:38.483 --> 23:40.886
It is our practice
and our way.

23:40.952 --> 23:42.053
Yeah, I get that.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.623
But what are you training for?

23:46.558 --> 23:48.260
Like when I was with the Titans,

23:48.326 --> 23:49.961
we trained a lot too.

23:50.061 --> 23:53.832
But we trained to fight.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.400
Did you fight often?

23:55.467 --> 23:58.470
No... not very much,
actually.

23:59.905 --> 24:02.974
I thought we'd would fight
a lot more,

24:03.074 --> 24:05.777
you know, as a team
against bad guys.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.414
It almost never
worked out that way.

24:09.481 --> 24:14.186
Hmm. I have found
to fight a battle
is to invite another.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.821
And another and soon--

24:21.026 --> 24:23.695
You remind me
of my daughter.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.431
Her temper was
even greater than yours.

24:27.933 --> 24:29.167
Your daughter?

24:30.502 --> 24:31.536
She's dead.

24:33.338 --> 24:35.874
I'm so sorry.
I, I didn't even...

24:35.974 --> 24:38.009
She was killed in battle.

24:38.109 --> 24:40.479
We made many attempts
to bring her back.

24:41.346 --> 24:42.514
None were successful.

24:44.449 --> 24:48.019
So what are you saying?
That we can't really
bring Donna back?

24:48.119 --> 24:49.187
Not at all.

24:49.287 --> 24:51.289
A return from death
is possible,

24:51.356 --> 24:53.124
I've seen it happen.

24:53.191 --> 24:57.395
But I've never been sure
how and why the process
was successful.

24:57.496 --> 25:01.166
And in the case of my daughter,
I became unsure as to...

25:01.233 --> 25:04.169
whom I was attempting
to do it for?

25:12.911 --> 25:15.580
Listen, when Tim's ready
to travel, I'm taking him back
to the train. Okay?

25:15.680 --> 25:17.148
No, your not.

25:17.215 --> 25:20.218
- Excuse me?
- Who do you think
your kidding?

25:20.318 --> 25:22.754
You can talk about
clownfish and hamster wheels

25:22.854 --> 25:24.389
and moving forward
all you want.

25:24.489 --> 25:26.391
But none of that changes
who you are.

25:26.491 --> 25:28.927
Oh, please don't start
Hank-splaining me to me, okay?

25:29.027 --> 25:31.930
When those ghost
assholes floated in here,
you know what you did?

25:32.864 --> 25:34.332
You ran to him.

25:34.399 --> 25:36.167
You put yourself
between him and hell.

25:36.234 --> 25:37.569
Some guy
you met an hour ago.

25:37.669 --> 25:39.771
So don't tell me
you're done being a hero.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.039
Okay.

25:41.106 --> 25:42.908
But this hero
is not gonna risk

25:43.008 --> 25:44.943
that kid's eternal soul
to go look for some
mythical bridge

25:45.043 --> 25:47.078
that probably
doesn't even exist.

25:47.178 --> 25:49.447
- It's just no worth it.
Yes, it is, Ms. Troy.

25:54.185 --> 25:58.290
I mean... you are
Donna Troy, aren't you?

25:58.390 --> 25:59.591
And you're Hank Hall.

26:00.692 --> 26:01.693
You're Hawk.

26:02.794 --> 26:04.529
Um...

26:04.596 --> 26:08.099
I was Donna Troy
and he was Hank Hall.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.269
Can I ask how you
know all of this?

26:11.369 --> 26:12.704
It's all coming back.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.775
I'm from Gotham.

26:16.875 --> 26:19.578
And when I was alive,
I spent a lot of time
thinking about you.

26:19.644 --> 26:22.447
Researching, finding out
everything I could.

26:22.547 --> 26:25.050
I know about Dick Grayson,
too, I know he's Nightwing.

26:25.116 --> 26:29.955
And I, I know about
Starfire and Beast Boy
and Superboy.

26:30.055 --> 26:31.289
They're all in Gotham City
right now

26:31.389 --> 26:33.091
trying to stop
Red Hood and Scarecrow.

26:34.392 --> 26:35.794
I was trying to help them.

26:36.795 --> 26:38.330
That's how I got shot.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.466
I'm sorry that
happened to you.

26:41.566 --> 26:43.969
Believe me I know
how you feel but--

26:44.069 --> 26:45.570
No.

26:45.637 --> 26:46.738
You don't.

26:49.140 --> 26:50.809
I was shot in the back.

26:54.412 --> 26:56.748
All I ever wanted
was to be a hero.

26:57.916 --> 26:59.117
Like you.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.587
Instead I froze.

27:04.022 --> 27:05.624
And then I ran.

27:07.592 --> 27:08.960
I died a coward.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.331
That's why I have
to go back.

27:13.431 --> 27:16.701
What happened down there,
that can't be my story.

27:16.801 --> 27:19.838
Being a hero doesn't mean
never being scared.

27:19.938 --> 27:21.439
And it doesn't mean
putting yourself in danger

27:21.506 --> 27:23.308
that you're not ready
to handle yet.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.610
Well... maybe
you two can give me

27:25.677 --> 27:27.545
some pointers
once we're back in Gotham.

27:31.683 --> 27:33.118
Kid's got balls.

27:38.690 --> 27:40.392
You know if we end up
back on Earth,

27:40.492 --> 27:43.128
there's no guarantee
it's gonna work out
any different.

27:43.194 --> 27:44.896
You know that, right?

27:44.996 --> 27:46.998
I don't need
a guarantee, Ms. Troy.

27:48.633 --> 27:50.368
I just need a chance.

27:52.537 --> 27:55.173
Sounds like he's ready
to move forward, too.

28:06.551 --> 28:07.585
Okay.

28:08.720 --> 28:09.921
I'll help you.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.158
We both will.

28:15.026 --> 28:16.728
Thank you.

28:16.828 --> 28:21.066
And stop calling me
Ms. Troy, all right?

28:21.166 --> 28:22.867
- Knew it
- Shut up.

28:25.737 --> 28:26.771
Come on.

29:29.501 --> 29:30.568
She's dead.

29:33.438 --> 29:34.773
She's really dead.

29:36.174 --> 29:37.776
Yes, Rachel.

29:37.842 --> 29:39.477
And she's never coming back.

29:41.112 --> 29:43.181
No... she isn't.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.486
Will her soul... be okay?

29:51.289 --> 29:52.357
I hope so.

29:59.364 --> 30:01.166
I think it's time
I should go.

30:02.767 --> 30:05.870
Was that the result
you were hoping for?

30:05.970 --> 30:07.672
No.

30:07.772 --> 30:11.209
But perhaps balance
has been restored.

30:35.366 --> 30:37.869
- No one behind us.
- For now.

30:37.969 --> 30:39.838
Do you know
where we're going?

30:39.904 --> 30:42.707
Guy said to look
for an "upside down tree."

30:42.807 --> 30:45.310
- What does
that even mean?
- How far is it?

30:45.376 --> 30:49.347
I don't know a mile,
10,000 miles.

30:49.414 --> 30:50.982
I don't even know
if they use miles here.

30:51.049 --> 30:53.184
Maybe they're
on the metric system.

30:53.251 --> 30:55.987
Maybe you better pass out
those guns, just in case.

30:56.054 --> 30:57.222
I don't have them.

30:58.256 --> 30:59.324
Why not?

31:00.225 --> 31:01.426
I never did.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.164
How do I
explain this?

31:06.231 --> 31:08.233
I don't wanna
freak you guys out or anything.

31:08.333 --> 31:12.337
But ever since I died,
I've been getting in touch
with my spiritual side--

31:15.506 --> 31:17.575
Okay, you know what,
forget it.

31:17.675 --> 31:19.911
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31:20.011 --> 31:21.713
- No!
- Go on. No, Hank.

31:21.779 --> 31:23.014
Go on.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.452
I was gonna say...

31:28.686 --> 31:31.422
Things work
a little different here.

31:34.859 --> 31:37.695
If you picture something
you really want,

31:38.696 --> 31:40.965
really focus your mind on it.

31:42.767 --> 31:44.102
It appears.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.072
The hell?

31:48.139 --> 31:49.474
I know, I know.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.644
Back there at the bar,
you know,

31:53.912 --> 31:55.780
I was a little scared.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.483
And I started thinking
to myself,

31:58.583 --> 32:01.119
"It'd be really nice
if I had some guns right now."

32:02.720 --> 32:04.923
And the next thing
you know...

32:06.224 --> 32:08.059
Sounds a little...

32:08.126 --> 32:11.396
- Corny, I know,
but look, when you die--
- Stop, stop, stop.

32:27.445 --> 32:28.780
Son of a bitch!

32:29.847 --> 32:31.149
It is upside down.

32:34.352 --> 32:35.987
But I don't see
any bridge.

33:26.971 --> 33:28.539
Told ya.

33:28.639 --> 33:30.875
So, what's the deal?

33:30.975 --> 33:33.678
We just walk across
and end up back on Earth?

33:35.413 --> 33:36.914
Only one way to find out.

33:53.331 --> 33:55.233
Any idea
how long this is?

33:55.333 --> 33:57.068
Nope.

33:57.168 --> 33:59.370
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea after all.

34:01.105 --> 34:03.574
I'm getting
a really bad feeling.

34:03.674 --> 34:05.543
Just keep walking.
You'll be fine.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.188
Oh, shit!

34:18.122 --> 34:19.056
Great!

34:34.939 --> 34:36.274
Oh, come on!

34:38.709 --> 34:40.144
Let's do this.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.112
Ha!

34:41.879 --> 34:43.147
Oh, really!

34:43.247 --> 34:45.083
Pretty sure I wasn't
thinking about Grayson.

34:48.986 --> 34:50.955
What the hell!

34:56.494 --> 34:58.162
Guns, guns, guns.

34:59.464 --> 35:01.099
Okay, this makes no sense.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.502
Ow!

35:16.280 --> 35:17.615
That's more like it.

35:18.349 --> 35:19.784
She gets a sword!

35:53.618 --> 35:55.219
Oh, no.

35:55.319 --> 35:56.354
No, no, no.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.356
Jump!

35:58.456 --> 35:59.891
Tim, jump!

36:09.367 --> 36:10.501
Tim, come on!

36:11.402 --> 36:12.970
You gotta jump.

36:13.037 --> 36:15.339
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

36:19.977 --> 36:21.179
Ahh!

36:41.599 --> 36:42.733
Hank, come on!

36:57.515 --> 36:59.116
Sorry, asshole...

36:59.217 --> 37:00.351
not gonna happen.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.224
Go!

37:06.290 --> 37:08.192
Get him out of here
before more come.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.461
Tell Dawn I love her.

37:11.596 --> 37:12.697
Now go!

37:13.864 --> 37:15.299
Go on.

37:31.215 --> 37:32.917
Now this I can work with.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.006
- Guess we made it.
- Yeah.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.575
I guess we did.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.313
Ms. Troy--

38:02.413 --> 38:04.515
Would you stop calling me
Ms. Troy?

38:04.615 --> 38:07.184
I mean how old
do you think I am, anyway?

38:07.285 --> 38:09.620
- Old. Like 30.
- Thirty--

38:10.988 --> 38:13.658
Whatever. What is your point?

38:13.758 --> 38:15.359
I just wanted
to say thank you.

38:17.862 --> 38:19.430
You're welcome.

38:22.867 --> 38:24.135
Do you hear that?

38:24.935 --> 38:26.637
You all right?

38:29.607 --> 38:30.808
Oh, my God!

38:34.145 --> 38:35.446
Ms. Troy...

38:35.513 --> 38:38.115
- Donna...
- It's all right. Here.

38:38.182 --> 38:39.717
You're gonna be all right.

38:44.622 --> 38:45.890
You are a hero, Tim.

38:47.124 --> 38:48.059
Okay?

38:48.893 --> 38:50.227
You made the jump.

39:01.706 --> 39:02.740
He's back.

39:03.974 --> 39:05.376
Ninety-three
seconds, Doctor.

39:34.405 --> 39:35.539
Hank...

39:46.350 --> 39:48.352
- Donnie...

39:54.225 --> 39:56.026
It's been a minute,
big brother.

40:02.933 --> 40:03.934
Where've you been?

40:04.034 --> 40:05.302
Looking for you, man.

40:07.905 --> 40:10.608
- You almost missed me.
- Yeah.

40:12.042 --> 40:14.111
I gotta say...

40:14.211 --> 40:16.280
I'm glad you're still here.

40:19.984 --> 40:21.986
What the hell
are you doing
in this costume?

40:22.086 --> 40:23.287
Oh, yeah...

40:24.822 --> 40:27.291
I don't know, man.
I just...

40:27.391 --> 40:31.095
A lotta people
around here need help,
you know.

40:31.162 --> 40:33.130
Those damn ghouls
have been getting away
with murder.

40:33.230 --> 40:35.800
So I figured...

40:35.900 --> 40:38.502
maybe this place
could use itself a little
Dove and Hawk.

40:39.737 --> 40:40.971
Uh...

40:41.071 --> 40:43.140
I think you mean
Hawk and Dove, right?

40:43.240 --> 40:44.408
That's what you meant.

40:44.475 --> 40:46.010
Actually, no, I mean
Dove and Hawk.

40:47.745 --> 40:49.447
Uh, you know,
we can about the name.

40:49.513 --> 40:51.148
- You wanna talk about it? Okay.
- We'll talk about he name.

40:51.248 --> 40:52.416
- We got time.

42:44.261 --> 42:45.930
- Bruce.

42:46.764 --> 42:47.932
Bruce, wake up.

42:48.032 --> 42:49.533
Bruce!

42:49.600 --> 42:50.534
Bruce, wake up!

42:59.610 --> 43:00.778
Am I dead?

43:02.046 --> 43:03.080
No.

43:05.783 --> 43:06.984
But you are.

43:08.886 --> 43:09.987
Not anymore.
