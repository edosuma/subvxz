00:09.125 --> 00:12.458
I'm proud of my one term
as Student Council President.

00:13.208 --> 00:15.875
Why was I not re-elected? Nobody knows.

00:15.959 --> 00:17.333
You made the school day longer.

00:17.417 --> 00:18.458
You banned desserts.

00:18.542 --> 00:20.041
You got rid
of the faculty pinball machine.

00:20.125 --> 00:21.500
Nobody knows!

00:23.250 --> 00:26.166
Please welcome
our new Student Council President

00:26.166 --> 00:29.208
Kim Beulah Crawford. That's right, people.

00:29.291 --> 00:30.667
You voted in a Beulah.

00:40.792 --> 00:42.458
Fellow students,

00:42.542 --> 00:44.625
There is nothing I will not do for you.

00:44.709 --> 00:46.125
Place your hand on the turtle.

00:46.208 --> 00:47.667
What? I am not touching that wart bag.

00:48.375 --> 00:49.250
It's tradition, Kim.

00:49.333 --> 00:51.250
To be sworn in,
you have to put your hand on Arlo.

00:54.125 --> 00:57.125
My heart is clean. My mind is fertile.

00:57.667 --> 00:58.792
I'm the Prez...

01:00.709 --> 01:02.000
- Swear on the turtle.
- Aww.

01:08.041 --> 01:10.583
And now I'd like to bring up
a good friend.

01:11.083 --> 01:12.750
<i>He's loyal. He's true.</i>

01:13.083 --> 01:14.166
And he's dependable.

01:14.792 --> 01:15.917
He's my Vice President,

01:15.917 --> 01:17.166
<i>Jack Brewer!</i>

01:22.125 --> 01:23.333
Thank you.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.166
So I was told as Vice President,

01:27.250 --> 01:28.875
all I have to do
is stand up here and look good.

01:28.959 --> 01:30.458
So here you go.

01:32.542 --> 01:33.709
-
- Thank you.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.458
And now Erica Straffman has put together

01:37.542 --> 01:39.166
a special victory performance.

01:43.542 --> 01:44.834
Thank you, Kim.

01:45.333 --> 01:47.041
I think y'all know who I am.

01:47.125 --> 01:48.208
I'all don't.

01:48.291 --> 01:49.875
Then I'll tell you.

01:51.417 --> 01:54.000
I'm a nationally ranked
cheerleader and gymnast.

01:54.083 --> 01:56.041
And I'm the head of our dance committee.

01:56.625 --> 01:58.041
This is for you, Kim.

01:58.125 --> 01:59.792
Isn't she sweet?

01:59.875 --> 02:01.208
Get in line, Gina.

02:19.542 --> 02:21.375
Gina, look out, Frank's got the turtle.

02:28.417 --> 02:29.250
Frank!

02:29.333 --> 02:30.875
Why do you always ruin everything?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.125
Look at what you've done.

02:32.208 --> 02:33.667
- Are you okay, hon'?
- Yeah, I think so.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.125
- I just need--
- Come here.

02:35.250 --> 02:37.667
Daddy's gonna take care of you.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.291
Ohh!

I don't know, okay?

03:26.750 --> 03:28.500
This decision could
affect a lot of people.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.750
It could define my presidency.

03:31.041 --> 03:33.041
Kim, remember why you ran.

03:33.291 --> 03:35.375
This is your chance to make a difference.

03:36.166 --> 03:37.291
You're right.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.709
By presidential decree

03:42.083 --> 03:43.542
from this day forward,

03:44.959 --> 03:47.792
any student wearing the mascot suit
will be required to wear underpants

03:47.875 --> 03:49.250
at all school functions!

03:49.333 --> 03:51.333
<i>-</i>

03:53.291 --> 03:55.750
Kim, if it's all right with you,
I'd like to say something.

03:57.166 --> 04:00.542
As head of the dance committee,
I suggest that we throw...

04:00.625 --> 04:02.166
A Fall Ball.

04:03.458 --> 04:04.667
<i>Picture this,</i>

04:04.750 --> 04:07.125
the entrance to the gym
is a sea of icebergs.

04:07.208 --> 04:09.709
The doors open and you've just boarded...

04:09.792 --> 04:11.041
The Titanic.

04:12.917 --> 04:16.208
I see good times off the starboard bow.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.458
It's not worth it, Erica.

04:19.542 --> 04:22.458
Frank ruins every event
your dance committee puts on.

04:22.542 --> 04:24.917
He's right. Remember the hive of hornets
he put in the air vent

04:25.000 --> 04:25.875
at the spring formal?

04:25.959 --> 04:28.125
That was a riot!

04:29.917 --> 04:31.083
Kids' faces so messed up

04:31.166 --> 04:32.834
you couldn't tell
the hornet bites from the zits.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.458
Kim, we voted for you

04:36.458 --> 04:39.917
because we thought that you would
stand up to people like Frank.

04:39.917 --> 04:41.041
Am I right, y'all?

04:41.125 --> 04:42.208
Yeah.

04:46.125 --> 04:47.375
You know what?

04:48.458 --> 04:49.667
You're right.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.875
By presidential decree,

04:54.875 --> 04:56.667
we shall get our boogie on.

05:01.458 --> 05:03.917
Motion to ban the president
from ever dancing again?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.125
- Seconded!
<i>Seconded!</i>

05:08.166 --> 05:10.875
Duck migration
is my favorite time of the year.

05:11.709 --> 05:14.542
And we got front-row seats
to the poop storm.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.458
Oh, Rudy, you forgot the tahini sauce.

05:19.542 --> 05:20.834
Oh, I'll get it.

05:20.917 --> 05:22.166
Rudy, don't.

05:22.250 --> 05:23.542
Every year they get you.

05:23.625 --> 05:25.375
I'll make it. I just got to be quick.

05:28.667 --> 05:31.000
<i>-</i>

05:31.083 --> 05:32.667
Oh, no, they're here.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.709
Oh, no! I'm never gonna make it.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.041
Yeah!

05:44.125 --> 05:46.208
First time in four years
you didn't get me,

05:46.291 --> 05:48.291
- you dumb ducks!
-

05:48.417 --> 05:49.542
What?

05:52.208 --> 05:53.750
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

05:54.125 --> 05:55.542
So Kim,

05:55.625 --> 05:58.250
the whole school's talking about this
little dance you approved.

05:58.375 --> 05:59.875
Would you go with me?

06:00.000 --> 06:00.917
No.

06:00.917 --> 06:04.083
Then unlike the real Titanic,
this one's going down.

06:05.917 --> 06:07.917
Guys, somebody stole Arlo last night,

06:08.041 --> 06:09.500
and Funderburk is freaking out.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.917
He's the chief administrator
of a high school.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
I doubt he's freaking out
over a missing turtle.

06:14.083 --> 06:16.917
He's gone.

06:18.542 --> 06:20.750
We've been turtle-napped, people!

06:22.250 --> 06:25.208
He was in his cage when I left at 4:00.

06:25.291 --> 06:27.709
And I saw the cage was empty at 6:00.

06:27.792 --> 06:28.959
Why were you in my office?

06:29.041 --> 06:32.125
Uh, well, I certainly wasn't using
your private bathroom.

06:36.333 --> 06:37.583
I just got an anonymous text

06:37.667 --> 06:40.041
saying Arlo is in locker 137.

06:40.125 --> 06:41.333
That's Frank's locker.

06:41.417 --> 06:42.458
Wait a minute!

06:43.500 --> 06:45.250
I didn't even know I had a locker.

06:46.333 --> 06:47.625
Nobody believes you, Frank.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.667
I'll open it myself.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.166
I got a master key.

06:51.834 --> 06:53.291
Oh, there it is.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.959
Here's my little guy.

07:06.709 --> 07:09.166
I missed you!

07:10.125 --> 07:11.291
Frank!

07:11.375 --> 07:13.959
You are going to detention
for a long time!

07:16.083 --> 07:17.125
What happened?

07:17.208 --> 07:19.667
Frank's stole Arlo and
now he's got detention.

07:19.750 --> 07:22.000
Sending Frank to detention is a joke.

07:22.542 --> 07:25.875
Kim, as President,
isn't there something you can do?

07:27.750 --> 07:28.583
There is.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.583
Section seven of
the School Constitution states

07:30.667 --> 07:32.542
that a unanimous vote
from the School Council

07:32.625 --> 07:34.250
can expel a disruptive student.

07:36.875 --> 07:37.917
Please, Milton.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.041
I got this.

07:41.583 --> 07:43.417
Section seven of the School Constitution

07:43.500 --> 07:45.959
states exactly what Milton said.

07:50.625 --> 07:52.458
<i>♪ I love to go swimming ♪</i>

07:52.542 --> 07:54.417
<i>♪ With bow-legged women ♪</i>

07:55.917 --> 07:57.291
Oh, no!

07:57.792 --> 07:58.709
Not again!

07:58.792 --> 08:00.000
I think that's the one that got me.

08:00.834 --> 08:02.792
Louie's been following me around all day.

08:02.875 --> 08:05.208
It's because you're
acting like his mother.

08:05.208 --> 08:07.166
I am not!

08:07.250 --> 08:09.709
Don't you listen to the bad man.

08:09.792 --> 08:14.333
Oh, you're my little baby boy
and I love you so much.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.917
Jerry, it's a wild animal.

08:17.041 --> 08:18.625
You got to return him to his flock.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.917
You're right.

08:21.083 --> 08:22.959
We're from two different worlds.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.208
Sure, we both have webbed feet
and eat worms,

08:26.291 --> 08:27.458
but that's just not enough.

08:31.041 --> 08:33.166
Yeah, that's him, all right.

08:34.917 --> 08:36.917
You were the tail gunner, weren't you?

08:37.959 --> 08:40.291
You heard it! He admitted it!

08:50.166 --> 08:51.417
What's the matter, Frank?

08:52.333 --> 08:55.166
You crying 'cause you found one
of Phil's nose hairs in your hummus?

08:55.667 --> 08:56.875
Yes.

09:00.125 --> 09:02.417
And because I'm being framed at school.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.792
Ah, dude, they found Arlo in your locker.

09:04.875 --> 09:06.542
A turtle in a locker?

09:06.625 --> 09:07.917
That's not me.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.208
Now packing Danny Doyle's trombone
full of mashed potatoes,

09:11.291 --> 09:12.792
that's classic Frank.

09:13.750 --> 09:16.166
-
- More trombone!

09:16.250 --> 09:18.166
Doyle, more trombone.

09:19.375 --> 09:21.166
Come on, Doyle, more tromb--

09:23.208 --> 09:24.917
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.625
Funderburk sneezed potatoes for a month.

09:28.041 --> 09:29.375
You got to help me, Jack.

09:29.458 --> 09:31.792
If I get expelled, I'll be homeschooled.

09:31.875 --> 09:34.250
giving Mother a wedgie
is awkward for both of us.

09:35.750 --> 09:36.750
Come to think of it,

09:36.834 --> 09:38.625
this would be the first prank
you committed

09:38.709 --> 09:39.917
that you didn't take credit for.

09:40.041 --> 09:41.458
Because I didn't do it.

09:41.542 --> 09:43.750
I was at the Black Dragon Dojo
when it happened.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.208
Well, then you couldn't have done it.

09:46.083 --> 09:47.542
But I just have one more question.

09:48.375 --> 09:50.792
Why is Milton making
kissy faces with that duck?

09:54.709 --> 09:56.500
That dude needs a girlfriend fast.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.166
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

10:01.250 --> 10:02.792
Okay, before we take a vote,

10:02.875 --> 10:04.500
does anybody have anything to say?

10:04.583 --> 10:05.417
I do!

10:05.500 --> 10:06.875
Frank is a liar.

10:06.959 --> 10:08.250
A Liar.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.125
And his pants are indeed on fire.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.166
Noted. Now let's take a vote.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.542
All council members
in favor of expelling Frank,

10:16.625 --> 10:17.667
say, "Aye."

10:17.750 --> 10:18.750
Aye.

10:18.834 --> 10:21.625
- All those opposed say "Nay."
- Nay.

10:21.709 --> 10:23.000
Yes! It's unanimous!

10:23.083 --> 10:24.750
All thanks to me, Frank Bickel is--

10:24.834 --> 10:26.625
I'm sorry? Did you just "nay" me?

10:28.917 --> 10:30.500
I believe that Frank is innocent.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.250
I just got hit with a shoe.

10:37.333 --> 10:39.417
This is unacceptable.

10:40.250 --> 10:42.583
Jack is entitled to express his opinion

10:42.667 --> 10:44.000
no matter how unpopular it is!

10:44.083 --> 10:46.208
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

10:56.083 --> 10:58.125
Do you ever feel like you're totally alone

10:58.208 --> 10:59.208
floating on a raft

10:59.291 --> 11:00.750
in the middle of a sea of hate?

11:01.291 --> 11:02.250
Usually.

11:04.291 --> 11:05.458
Why do you ask?

11:08.250 --> 11:09.500
No reason.

11:10.834 --> 11:12.291
You don't have any lunch. How do you eat?

11:12.375 --> 11:15.083
By making kids so mad
they throw food at me.

11:16.208 --> 11:17.208
Check it.

11:17.291 --> 11:18.458
Hey, Marty!

11:18.542 --> 11:19.959
I like your sneakers.

11:20.041 --> 11:21.792
Does your sister know you're wearing them?

11:23.375 --> 11:25.083
Meatloaf, nice.

11:25.875 --> 11:27.625
Hey, Jack. I don't know if you heard,

11:27.750 --> 11:30.208
but we're having another vote
on Frank's expulsion tomorrow.

11:30.583 --> 11:32.417
Look, I'm sorry. I'm not changing my mind.

11:33.875 --> 11:36.250
You don't have to. You're fired.

11:36.333 --> 11:37.291
What?

11:37.375 --> 11:38.917
You picked me as Vice President

11:39.041 --> 11:40.667
Because I'm a strong, independent thinker

11:40.750 --> 11:42.166
who will always do what's right.

11:42.250 --> 11:45.417
I picked you because you were
nice eye-candy for the campaign poster.

11:46.625 --> 11:48.542
I feel so used!

11:49.250 --> 11:51.208
Look, Jack, you told me
I could make a difference,

11:51.291 --> 11:52.834
and now you're standing in my way.

11:52.917 --> 11:56.166
I will be remembered as the president
who got Frank kicked out of school.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.041
Wow, if she could do that,

11:58.125 --> 12:00.000
she would be very popular, Jack.

12:01.041 --> 12:01.917
Frank.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.417
Kim, I really believe Frank is innocent.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.125
Funderburk said he saw
Arlo in his cage at 4:00.

12:08.208 --> 12:09.959
And Bert said the cage was empty at 6:00.

12:10.500 --> 12:11.500
So?

12:11.583 --> 12:12.792
So Frank couldn't have done it.

12:12.875 --> 12:14.542
He was at the Black
Dragons' dojo at that time.

12:15.417 --> 12:16.458
<i>Really, Jack?</i>

12:16.542 --> 12:18.125
My brother's a Black Dragon

12:18.208 --> 12:20.166
and they've been closed all week

12:20.250 --> 12:21.750
for fumigation.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.208
<i>Wow, Jack.</i>

12:25.291 --> 12:27.542
Your new friend Frank
turns out to be a liar.

12:28.166 --> 12:29.333
What a shock.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.750
Let's go, Erica.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.458
Oh, hey, Milton.
Did you take Louie back to his family?

12:41.542 --> 12:42.959
Absolutely.

12:44.166 --> 12:46.000
I'm proud of you. See, Jerry,

12:46.083 --> 12:47.542
He did the right thing.

12:51.041 --> 12:52.250
Whoa, whoa.

12:53.542 --> 12:54.959
What's going on there?

12:55.041 --> 12:56.709
I think I'm having a reaction to some...

12:56.834 --> 12:59.041
-
- ...bad jambalaya.

12:59.125 --> 13:01.083
-
- Aah!

13:01.166 --> 13:03.542
Dude, I am never eating jambalaya.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.333
It's Louie!

13:10.417 --> 13:11.625
- Dude.
- You didn't take him back?

13:11.709 --> 13:13.792
I tried. I couldn't.

13:14.291 --> 13:17.667
This little featherly fella
just quacked his way into my heart.

13:18.709 --> 13:20.750
Well, now we gotta figure out what to do.

13:20.834 --> 13:21.917
Got it.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.750
Put pants on him and raise him as a human.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.166
No.

13:26.250 --> 13:28.291
His flock already left the park.

13:28.417 --> 13:30.417
If he doesn't join them,
he's never gonna see them again.

13:31.208 --> 13:33.000
Dude, what are we supposed to do?

13:33.083 --> 13:35.959
Grow wings, fly up in the air
and reunite him with his family?

13:41.500 --> 13:43.041
What?

13:46.542 --> 13:48.208
This is Mama Bird.

13:48.291 --> 13:50.083
I see Louie's flock up ahead.

13:50.542 --> 13:52.291
It won't be long now, Louie.

13:55.083 --> 13:56.166
Be advised,

13:56.250 --> 13:58.834
Fred the barber is on the roof

13:58.917 --> 14:00.834
sunbathing in his underpants.

14:01.542 --> 14:02.834
Jack!

14:02.917 --> 14:04.792
Sorry I lied about being in the dojo.

14:04.875 --> 14:06.583
I couldn't tell you the truth because

14:06.667 --> 14:07.834
I was embarrassed.

14:07.917 --> 14:09.625
You, embarrassed?

14:09.709 --> 14:12.625
Last week you wore your underpants
outside your jeans.

14:13.375 --> 14:15.709
I thought it made me look
like a superhero.

14:17.458 --> 14:18.542
If I tell you where I was,

14:18.625 --> 14:20.041
promise you won't laugh?

14:20.125 --> 14:21.291
Yes, of course.

14:31.291 --> 14:33.041
You said you wouldn't laugh.

14:33.125 --> 14:35.291
Well, I didn't know
you flounced around in tights.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.959
I don't flounce, Jack.

14:37.291 --> 14:38.667
I <i>jeté.</i>

14:38.750 --> 14:40.542
I <i>jeté!</i>

14:40.917 --> 14:42.625
All right, I don't blame you for lying.

14:42.709 --> 14:45.291
Hey, don't cross this tape.

14:45.375 --> 14:46.792
I don't want you getting your footprints

14:46.875 --> 14:48.750
all over my freshly waxed floors.

14:48.834 --> 14:49.834
Sorry, Bert.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.834
Do you wax every day?

14:53.917 --> 14:55.166
No, not every day.

14:55.250 --> 14:56.917
Maybe if I'm gonna hit the beach,

14:56.959 --> 14:58.583
strut around in my mankini,

14:58.667 --> 15:00.500
- then I might--
- I was asking about the floors.

15:02.417 --> 15:03.875
Yeah. Every day.

15:07.333 --> 15:08.917
This is Mama Bird.

15:08.917 --> 15:11.333
I'm about 50 yards away
from Louie's flock.

15:11.417 --> 15:12.917
Roger that, Good Buddy.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.917
This is Swag Ranger.

15:14.917 --> 15:17.041
I'm sitting in the hen house
with the Pole Cat, over.

15:18.208 --> 15:20.375
Would you stop using
those stupid nicknames?

15:21.583 --> 15:24.792
Mama Bird, this is Flash Starblazer.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.000
Hit me back with a, uh...

15:29.875 --> 15:31.083
status update.

15:34.709 --> 15:37.041
Louie's rejoining his flock.

15:37.125 --> 15:38.709
That's it, Louie.

15:38.792 --> 15:40.375
Follow the lead bird.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.041
Mission complete.

15:44.125 --> 15:45.583
He's back with his family.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.750
- Aw, sweet!
- Yeah!

15:47.834 --> 15:49.000
Great work, Mama Bird.

15:49.083 --> 15:51.875
Ahh... Come on home.

15:53.875 --> 15:54.917
Oh, no.

15:54.917 --> 15:56.208
Oh, no, no.

15:56.291 --> 15:57.917
The whole flock is following me.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.875
They think I'm the lead bird!

16:01.041 --> 16:03.083
What? Where are you now?

16:03.166 --> 16:05.500
Uh, I'm right above the courtyard.

16:17.208 --> 16:18.709
Really, Louie?

16:21.500 --> 16:24.250
Any day we have to say good-bye
to a student

16:24.875 --> 16:26.333
is a sad day.

16:27.458 --> 16:28.542
Except when it's Frank.

16:30.834 --> 16:33.083
Conga line!

16:35.583 --> 16:37.417
Whoo!

16:38.125 --> 16:40.834
Okay. Okay, Council. Come on, come on.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.709
It's voting time.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.709
All those in favor
of expelling Frank Bickel

16:45.792 --> 16:47.166
from Seaford High, say--

16:47.250 --> 16:49.041
- Nay!
- Again with the nay-ing?

16:49.959 --> 16:52.166
Frank is innocent, and I can prove it.

16:52.250 --> 16:53.750
Everyone, follow me.

16:54.375 --> 16:55.750
Uh, Kim?

16:55.834 --> 16:56.750
What's he doing?

16:56.834 --> 16:58.375
Uh, excuse me?

16:58.458 --> 17:00.083
Okay, I am the President

17:00.166 --> 17:01.917
and I did not approve-- Okay.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.375
Following Jack approved.

17:05.125 --> 17:08.375
All right, we know Arlo
was taken between 4:00 and 6:00.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.166
And every day at that same time,

17:10.250 --> 17:11.750
Bert waxes the floors.

17:11.834 --> 17:14.000
So whoever put Arlo in Frank's locker

17:14.083 --> 17:15.333
would have left footprints.

17:16.250 --> 17:18.083
But there weren't any, right, Bert?

17:18.166 --> 17:19.417
Not a one.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.625
Floors were so clean
you could eat off them.

17:21.709 --> 17:22.583
Which I've done.

17:24.208 --> 17:25.959
I like the lemony taste.

17:26.041 --> 17:27.375
Yes, thank you, Bert.

17:28.709 --> 17:29.709
Whoever did this

17:29.792 --> 17:31.000
would have to reach the locker

17:31.083 --> 17:32.750
without touching the stairs,

17:32.834 --> 17:34.542
or the floor.

17:34.625 --> 17:35.875
Do you mind if I borrow this?

17:37.291 --> 17:39.000
Say Arlo is this book.

17:39.417 --> 17:41.917
So with Arlo in a backpack,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.291
our thief may have done
something like this.

17:53.792 --> 17:55.917
-
- Okay.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.083
- Wow!
-

18:42.375 --> 18:43.792
It was you, Jack.

18:43.875 --> 18:45.750
you set me up just so you could defend me

18:45.834 --> 18:47.250
so you could prove your own guilt.

18:47.333 --> 18:48.875
What kind of sick game are you playing?

18:50.375 --> 18:52.709
It wasn't me, Frank. It was Erica.

18:52.792 --> 18:54.291
What?

18:54.375 --> 18:56.417
Jack, you are just being crazy now.

18:56.917 --> 18:58.375
Kim, can we just get on with the vote?

18:58.458 --> 18:59.583
All those in favor?

19:00.041 --> 19:01.291
Wait a minute.

19:01.375 --> 19:03.667
Erica, Jack does have a point.

19:03.750 --> 19:06.333
You are the only one in school
that can do what Jack just did.

19:06.417 --> 19:08.333
Kim, don't tell me you're buying this.

19:08.417 --> 19:10.333
I mean, this is crazy.

19:17.875 --> 19:18.709
You know,

19:18.792 --> 19:20.500
what's crazy is that there's a size four

19:20.583 --> 19:23.250
precision balance gymnastics
shoe print up here.

19:24.125 --> 19:25.125
Well...

19:25.208 --> 19:26.750
That's up there--

19:26.834 --> 19:29.875
You see, sometimes what happens--

19:29.959 --> 19:31.250
Every once in a while there's--

19:31.333 --> 19:32.583
Okay, I did it!

19:35.083 --> 19:38.250
For three years,
Frank has ruined every one of my dances!

19:38.333 --> 19:39.792
Dirt bombs from the ceiling,

19:40.583 --> 19:43.041
frogs in the punch bowl.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.583
Oh, man.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.333
I thought those were gummy frogs.

19:48.166 --> 19:51.083
Erica, you're in big trouble.

19:51.166 --> 19:52.417
Take her to my office.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.542
I just wanted the entire school
to remember

19:54.625 --> 19:56.333
one perfect night put on by me,

19:56.417 --> 19:58.000
Erica Straffman!

19:58.083 --> 19:59.375
Keep it moving, Streetcar.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.208
I told you I didn't do it.

20:02.291 --> 20:03.917
Because I was doing ballet.

20:04.375 --> 20:05.375
That's right.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.375
I'm not gonna hide who I am anymore.

20:07.458 --> 20:09.375
I'm a dancer!

20:10.834 --> 20:12.667
So am I, Frank.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.333
So am I.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.250
Kim, I gotta hand it to you.

20:19.333 --> 20:21.375
When I was up there,
I never even noticed that shoeprint.

20:21.875 --> 20:23.333
It's 'cause there wasn't one.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.417
After you put it all together,
I knew you were right.

20:26.792 --> 20:29.083
I just wanted to make her admit it.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.583
That's pretty slick, Kim.

20:30.667 --> 20:33.083
I should have known you wouldn't have
stood up against the whole school

20:33.166 --> 20:34.834
unless you really believed
Frank was innocent.

20:35.417 --> 20:37.625
That's the kind of guts
I'd like to see in my vice president.

20:38.542 --> 20:40.125
- So I'm back?
- Yeah.

20:40.208 --> 20:42.291
I mean, we look great on a poster.

20:43.667 --> 20:45.166
Except that one.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.542
I kinda feel bad for doing that now.

20:55.208 --> 20:56.959
Dude, those ducks
aren't leaving without you.

20:57.041 --> 20:58.417
They think you're their mother.

21:01.291 --> 21:03.333
Leave me alone!

21:03.417 --> 21:05.333
I'm not ready to be a mom!

21:08.583 --> 21:10.208
I'll see you later.
I'm going to the movies.

21:10.917 --> 21:13.000
Well, you can't go out there
with that sandwich.

21:13.083 --> 21:14.417
Oh, please. They're ducks.

21:14.500 --> 21:16.083
You just gotta show them who's boss.

21:24.875 --> 21:29.041
<i>-</i>

21:57.041 --> 21:57.709
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:01.709 --> 22:02.709
<i>Yes!</i>
