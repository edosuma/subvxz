- Will.

27:35.738 --> 27:38.439
It's been a while. [chuckles]

27:40.991 --> 27:45.694
It... it actually feels trite
to ask you this, but how are you?

27:45.729 --> 27:47.228
- Good.
- Yeah?

27:47.264 --> 27:48.630
Good. Yeah. You?

27:48.665 --> 27:52.383
Um, no, I'm good. I'm so, so good.

27:52.408 --> 27:55.103
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

27:55.138 --> 28:00.308
Mm. I feel terrible about
how things ended with us,

28:00.344 --> 28:01.910
and, um, my behavior was...

28:01.945 --> 28:04.646
Hey, I knew what I was
getting myself into.

28:04.681 --> 28:06.049
Eh?

28:06.583 --> 28:08.216
- Kind of.
- Yeah. [laughs]

28:08.251 --> 28:09.908
There's no need.

28:10.718 --> 28:12.198
Probably not the time
or the place, anyway.

28:12.222 --> 28:13.695
Oh, yeah.

28:16.426 --> 28:18.193
So how are the kids?

28:18.228 --> 28:21.363
Um, great. They're
visiting Jake in Vancouver.

28:21.398 --> 28:24.532
He is... well, Charlie is.
Lilly actually came home

28:24.568 --> 28:26.134
'cause she missed her boyfriend.

28:26.169 --> 28:27.480
Can you believe she has a boyfriend?

28:27.505 --> 28:29.572
I'm reeling. [laughs]

28:29.606 --> 28:31.206
- So Jake's up in Vancouver?
- Um, yeah,

28:31.241 --> 28:34.042
he's directing a show up there.
We're not together.

28:34.077 --> 28:37.512
Yeah. That was not a
great plan, so... shocker!

28:37.547 --> 28:40.617
But, um, after all that,

28:41.418 --> 28:43.084
you were right about us.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.620
Ah, I take no pleasure in that.

28:45.656 --> 28:47.989
- Maybe just a little bit.
- Maybe a little bit.

28:48.025 --> 28:49.557
Yeah. [laughing] Yeah.

28:51.039 --> 28:53.294
- You okay?
- I'm good. Yeah.

28:53.330 --> 28:56.008
Closing that door was
actually very good for me.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.133
And you?

28:58.168 --> 29:01.336
You're here, hobnobbing
and fancy-pants.

29:01.371 --> 29:03.071
[both laugh]

29:03.106 --> 29:04.339
How... things are going well?

29:04.374 --> 29:06.307
Yeah. Um, you know, I mean,

29:06.343 --> 29:08.643
my fancy-pants are a
plus-one here tonight,

29:08.679 --> 29:11.746
but, yeah, also great.

29:11.782 --> 29:14.735
My book's about to go to
print in French and Russian.

29:14.760 --> 29:18.219
- Mm.
- And Focus bought the film rights.

29:18.255 --> 29:20.055
- Wow!
- Yeah.

29:20.090 --> 29:22.390
Yeah. Well, I always knew
things would happen for you.

29:22.426 --> 29:24.025
Ooh, no, you didn't.

29:24.061 --> 29:26.261
Ah, yes, I deserve that.

29:26.296 --> 29:30.231
Once I read you, I knew things
were gonna happen for you.

29:30.400 --> 29:31.885
You're a natural.

29:32.235 --> 29:34.502
Thank you. And what
about you, work-wise?

29:34.538 --> 29:36.104
Exciting. Yes.

29:36.139 --> 29:39.323
I just launched a
website with my friend:

29:39.743 --> 29:42.077
Lady Parts.

29:42.112 --> 29:44.112
- Lady Parts.
- Yeah. [laughing]

29:44.147 --> 29:45.413
- Sounds...
- It sounds dirty.

29:45.449 --> 29:46.781
- Very dirty.
- Yeah, it's...

29:46.817 --> 29:49.451
It's actually a lifestyle website

29:49.486 --> 29:51.368
for women in midlife.

29:51.618 --> 29:53.488
Clearly, you are our target demo.

29:53.523 --> 29:55.390
[chuckles] Well, I'm
happy for you, Abby.

29:55.425 --> 29:59.160
Yeah. It's good. So,
so good. Strong launch.

29:59.196 --> 30:01.362
- Wow.
- Yeah.

30:03.265 --> 30:05.533
You know who's a charm to chat up?

30:05.569 --> 30:07.235
Julie Chen.

30:07.270 --> 30:09.637
I just pitched her Lady
Parts, and she was all...

30:09.673 --> 30:11.439
these lights are on, but nobody's home.

30:11.475 --> 30:13.341
Babs, I love you, but
I think this is just...

30:13.376 --> 30:16.211
I know. I know. This may
have been a misguided idea.

30:16.246 --> 30:17.712
- Yeah.
- But thanks

30:17.748 --> 30:19.114
for letting us try, Pheebs.

30:19.149 --> 30:20.515
Yeah, I'm gonna find Abby.

30:20.550 --> 30:22.150
Yeah, well, let me know when you do.

30:22.185 --> 30:23.785
I'm gonna peace out with you ladies

30:23.820 --> 30:25.854
and let Phoebe get back
to Gemma... [gasps] Work.

30:25.889 --> 30:27.233
I told you you could stay, Delia.

30:27.257 --> 30:29.090
Just stay. It's fine.

30:29.126 --> 30:31.270
Wow, you really know how
to make a girl feel welcome.

30:31.294 --> 30:33.428
Wow. I love it.

30:33.463 --> 30:36.264
You guys show up uninvited,
and I'm the bitch.

30:36.299 --> 30:37.643
Nobody called you a bitch, Phoebe.

30:37.667 --> 30:38.745
You didn't have to. It's in your tone.

30:38.769 --> 30:39.653
- My tone?
- Yes.

30:39.678 --> 30:42.148
- Ladies, please.
- Let's just stop pretending

30:42.172 --> 30:43.382
like you didn't invite
us because of work.

30:43.406 --> 30:44.672
This is work, but obviously,

30:44.708 --> 30:46.020
you have zero respect for it.

30:46.045 --> 30:49.287
Okay. Babs, let's roll
out. Abby can catch up.

30:49.312 --> 30:51.357
And if you didn't ask about
the state of my marriage

30:51.381 --> 30:52.847
every time that I walked...

30:52.883 --> 30:55.536
Did I ask you about JD one time tonight?

30:55.561 --> 30:58.231
It's your marriage, Phoebe.
You can ignore it all you want.

30:59.723 --> 31:00.777
Wow.

31:01.848 --> 31:03.224
Thank you.

31:03.260 --> 31:05.460
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.

31:05.495 --> 31:06.861
We're just worried about you.

31:06.897 --> 31:08.530
That's why we hit you
with the questions.

31:08.565 --> 31:12.734
We haven't even seen
you. And we miss you.

31:12.769 --> 31:14.903
We care about you, okay?

31:14.938 --> 31:16.863
[sighs]

31:17.941 --> 31:19.819
I just thought he would
come to his senses by now

31:19.843 --> 31:21.511
and fight for me, but...

31:23.720 --> 31:25.910
He hasn't, so I guess
he doesn't want to.

31:30.754 --> 31:32.765
- Maybe he needs more time.
- Maybe he's just waiting

31:32.789 --> 31:35.108
for you to make the first move.

31:35.982 --> 31:37.624
<i>What do you want?</i>

31:42.272 --> 31:43.832
I have to get back. I'm sorry.

31:43.867 --> 31:46.668
But you guys can stay, or... or not.

31:46.703 --> 31:48.335
It's whatever you want to do.

31:52.742 --> 31:54.843
Well, we should bounce.

31:54.878 --> 31:57.378
Yeah, definitely. I'm gonna get the car.

31:57.414 --> 31:58.804
[gasps]

31:59.052 --> 32:01.359
- Oh, my God.
- What did I miss?

32:02.953 --> 32:05.553
- [gasps]
- _

32:05.589 --> 32:08.007
It's Philip Christede.

32:08.325 --> 32:09.624
Of course he's here.

32:09.659 --> 32:11.593
Dickwad among dickwads.

32:11.628 --> 32:13.976
Go serve his ass, girl.

32:14.464 --> 32:16.331
[phone keyboard clicking]

32:16.366 --> 32:18.466
We're doing this series
of first-person narratives

32:18.501 --> 32:20.935
about sex and estrogen
replacement therapy.

32:20.971 --> 32:22.837
- I would read that.
- You should.

32:22.873 --> 32:24.606
You should get up in
that vagina research.

32:24.641 --> 32:26.541
- Ugh, save me!
- Hey.

32:26.576 --> 32:29.477
I cannot listen to that
woman one more second.

32:29.512 --> 32:32.547
"Blah, blah, blah. 1.2
billion per episode."

32:32.582 --> 32:35.216
Has to spend all day
opening residual checks.

32:35.252 --> 32:36.684
Get over yourself.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.364
Yeah, that's my least
favorite "Law & Order."

32:38.388 --> 32:39.388
I mean, it's so rape-y.

32:39.422 --> 32:40.855
- Right?
- Yes.

32:40.891 --> 32:43.706
Uh, Temple, this is... This is Abby.

32:43.731 --> 32:44.859
And, Abby, this is...

32:44.895 --> 32:46.261
No introduction necessary.

32:46.296 --> 32:47.406
Temple Hampton, I'm a big fan.

32:47.430 --> 32:48.763
It's really nice to meet you.

32:48.798 --> 32:50.465
Thank you. Are you nominated?

32:50.500 --> 32:53.501
For a BAFTA? Oh, my God, no.

32:53.536 --> 32:54.936
[chuckles] I'm a writer.

32:54.971 --> 32:57.738
I mean, I'm a real
writer, not a TV writer.

32:58.008 --> 33:00.475
Abby just started
this very cool website.

33:00.510 --> 33:01.809
- Is this the right drink?
- Oh.

33:01.845 --> 33:04.355
It's called Lady Parts. The website.

33:05.175 --> 33:08.676
And we're just starting to
plug it on Twitter, and...

33:09.352 --> 33:11.019
I should, uh, go find my friends.

33:11.054 --> 33:13.254
- It was really good seeing you.
- You too.

33:13.290 --> 33:15.364
- Nice to meet you, Abby.
- Nice to meet you too.

33:16.622 --> 33:18.326
Can you taste this, please?

33:18.361 --> 33:19.973
Does it have sugar in it?
Because I told them no sugar.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.531
I can't have sugar.

33:22.699 --> 33:26.301
So, we may have overstayed our welcome.

33:26.503 --> 33:28.436
- Any luck?
- Ugh!

33:28.471 --> 33:31.906
Yeah, I know. Ooh, is
that Temple Hampton?

33:31.942 --> 33:33.841
I love her. Did you target her?

33:33.877 --> 33:36.844
I tried, but that guy that she's with...

33:36.880 --> 33:39.047
- Cute.
- Is my ex.

33:39.082 --> 33:41.416
Shut up. Abby. Oh, my God.

33:41.451 --> 33:42.817
That's our in.

33:42.852 --> 33:44.519
Uh, yeah, no, I don't think so.

33:44.554 --> 33:46.654
Did you ask her? Work that contact.

33:46.690 --> 33:49.357
He is not a contact. He is my ex.

33:49.392 --> 33:51.292
It's all too embarrassing.

33:51.328 --> 33:54.028
Embarrassing? Have you seen
our unique viewer count?

33:54.064 --> 33:55.499
Let it go.

33:55.932 --> 33:58.833
My ex. My choice.

33:58.868 --> 34:00.479
This is an opportunity,
and we're gonna miss it

34:00.503 --> 34:01.970
because you're too proud?

34:02.005 --> 34:04.605
I made a decision.
That's it. It's final.

34:04.641 --> 34:06.374
I'm not your employee, Abby.

34:06.409 --> 34:08.643
Did I say that? No.
This is one decision.

34:08.678 --> 34:10.328
It's every decision.

34:10.353 --> 34:13.425
You never just trust me
unless I force your hand.

34:13.449 --> 34:14.927
I didn't agree to
take this risk with you

34:14.951 --> 34:16.751
so you could boss me around.

34:16.786 --> 34:18.496
Is that how you feel? That
I'm bossing you around?

34:18.521 --> 34:20.437
- Yeah.
- I see us as equals,

34:20.590 --> 34:23.056
and I'm sorry that I
don't want to talk to Will.

34:23.092 --> 34:26.027
I get that whatever happened
with this guy was painful.

34:26.062 --> 34:29.864
But that's in the past.
This website is our future.

34:29.899 --> 34:33.074
And as your partner and your equal,

34:33.100 --> 34:36.632
my gut is saying,
swallow your damn pride.

34:40.399 --> 34:43.234
[music and chatter]

34:43.995 --> 34:45.594
Here you go.

34:51.172 --> 34:53.706
Excuse me. Hi.

34:53.743 --> 34:55.074
Are you Philip Christede?

34:55.110 --> 34:56.643
Depends who's asking.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.679
I think we met in St. Barts.

34:58.714 --> 35:00.247
It was a really wild night.

35:00.283 --> 35:01.982
- That sounds about right.
- Mm-hmm.

35:02.018 --> 35:04.084
Oh, this is for you. It's a gift.

35:04.120 --> 35:05.886
- Hmm?
- Enjoy.

35:10.359 --> 35:13.060
Hey... What the hell is this?

35:13.095 --> 35:15.266
- Here we go.
- Gemma!

35:16.018 --> 35:17.516
Gemma!

35:18.000 --> 35:20.234
- Phil, what's going on?
- That woman...

35:20.269 --> 35:22.133
- He just point at me?
- She just subpoenaed me.

35:22.158 --> 35:24.625
- I didn't come here to be accosted.
- I know.

35:26.742 --> 35:28.266
Could we have these two escorted out?

35:28.298 --> 35:30.098
Okay. You ready?

35:30.133 --> 35:31.632
Would you follow me, please?

35:31.668 --> 35:34.669
[concerned chatter]

35:35.705 --> 35:37.238
[mouthing words]

35:45.350 --> 35:46.681
Hey.

35:47.249 --> 35:48.416
Hey.

35:48.451 --> 35:51.599
Um, so I wasn't entirely
honest with you before.

35:51.637 --> 35:56.393
My site... it is my chance
to do something important,

35:56.421 --> 36:00.067
and it is not easy
launching something new,

36:00.092 --> 36:02.125
and we are struggling.

36:02.161 --> 36:04.561
That is why we are here
crashing this party tonight.

36:04.596 --> 36:05.736
Crashed?

36:06.808 --> 36:08.241
How very Abby of you.

36:08.266 --> 36:10.705
That's right. My
fancy-pants are fraudulent.

36:10.730 --> 36:13.587
[laughs] We just need
a celeb to, you know,

36:13.643 --> 36:16.644
tweet or whatever about our site,

36:16.679 --> 36:18.112
and so far, we've struck out.

36:18.147 --> 36:20.014
So you need a holler on social media.

36:20.049 --> 36:21.115
Someone meaningful.

36:21.150 --> 36:23.651
Yes, and since my idea

36:23.686 --> 36:26.754
to approach Madeleine
Albright was vetoed,

36:26.789 --> 36:29.346
I thought I would ask your girlfriend.

36:31.222 --> 36:33.330
- Temple?
- Yeah.

36:34.018 --> 36:38.149
Oh, God, uh, no, she's
not my girlfriend.

36:38.174 --> 36:39.600
- Oh.
- She's not my girlfriend.

36:39.636 --> 36:40.533
- Sorry. I thought that...
- No, no, no.

36:40.558 --> 36:42.603
We're just... hanging out.

36:42.639 --> 36:44.502
- Oh, you're hanging out.
- Yeah.

36:44.874 --> 36:47.375
Oh. Um...

36:47.810 --> 36:49.844
Uh, well, she has a
lot of followers, so...

36:49.879 --> 36:52.713
Yeah. I think she has a
person that tweets for her.

36:52.749 --> 36:54.048
Oh, yeah, of course. Of course.

36:54.083 --> 36:55.917
- She has a lot of people.
- I bet.

36:55.952 --> 36:59.320
However, I happen to
have her phone right here.

36:59.355 --> 37:02.023
Oh, yes, those are too
big to fit in the clutch.

37:02.058 --> 37:05.326
More importantly, I know the pass code.

37:06.062 --> 37:07.509
Really?

37:09.032 --> 37:10.698
