00:03.969 --> 00:07.907
I'm gonna find out what the truth is.
You can count on it.

00:07.974 --> 00:11.376
<i>My father was the sheriff around here
about 4D years ago.</i>

00:11.444 --> 00:15.244
<i>He had this theory about aliens,
that they were real.</i>

00:15.315 --> 00:16.646
Sounds awfully silly,
doesn't it?

00:16.716 --> 00:20.243
Maybe you were right.
Maybe you were right all along.

00:20.320 --> 00:23.620
If anything happens to me again,
like when I got sick, don't help me.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.250
<i>I can't get entangled.
I gotta be a stone wall.</i>

00:26.326 --> 00:29.455
- We don't belong together.
- Don't say that.

00:29.529 --> 00:33.090
I know you think we shouldn't be
together, but you made me part of this.

01:31.090 --> 01:33.024
Fourteen calls
this morning, Sheriff...

01:33.092 --> 01:35.026
all about the sighting
last week.

01:35.094 --> 01:38.325
- Dry lightning, Deputy.
- I tell 'em that, but they keep calling.

01:38.397 --> 01:42.334
I have no time to talk to anybody about
unfounded or unsubstantiated rumors...

01:42.401 --> 01:45.336
and it is your job
to explain that to them.

01:45.404 --> 01:47.998
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, Deputy.

01:53.713 --> 01:55.977
Been a while,junior.

01:56.048 --> 01:58.016
How'd you get past
the front desk?

01:58.084 --> 01:59.950
Better beef up security.

02:01.354 --> 02:03.288
Heard you had a boy.

02:03.356 --> 02:05.381
Bachelor myself.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.449
<i>No kids for me.</i>

02:08.961 --> 02:10.895
You're not welcome here, Hub.

02:10.963 --> 02:14.263
Oh,junior,
I expect more from you...

02:14.333 --> 02:16.859
than dumb-ass,
small-town threats.

02:19.872 --> 02:23.502
Well,just wanted to stop by.

02:26.512 --> 02:29.209
Regards to your dad.

02:29.282 --> 02:34.152
From what I hear, you're starting to
come around to his way of thinking.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.552
[Chuckles]
See ya,junior.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.485
Who was that?

02:43.563 --> 02:47.557
That, Deputy, was
a bona fide alien hunter.

03:41.754 --> 03:43.688
I've concluded, Mr. Guerin...

03:43.756 --> 03:45.952
that, yes, these aliens do exist.

03:46.025 --> 03:47.959
Yes, they're among us today.

03:48.027 --> 03:50.792
And yes, they're brutal,
dangerous killers...

03:50.863 --> 03:53.798
and must be stopped at any cost.

03:53.866 --> 03:55.800
[Sighs]

03:55.868 --> 03:58.803
- I wasn't finished talking to him.
- I wanna get out of here.

03:58.871 --> 04:00.805
This place is
psychologically damaging.

04:00.873 --> 04:02.739
Hey, I've got no choice here.

04:02.808 --> 04:06.244
We've got cave paintings we don't
understand, Nasedo sending us messages.

04:06.312 --> 04:09.247
This place could hold
the answers to everything.

04:09.315 --> 04:12.444
Yeah, I'm sure it's a real mecca
for factual information.

04:12.518 --> 04:16.351
Save me. Save me. I'm a human
trapped in an alien body.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.857
Excuse us.

04:21.861 --> 04:25.627
You realize that we've just lost
our last shred of dignity.

04:34.006 --> 04:37.442
Okay, I have one green eggs
with moon rock hash...

04:37.510 --> 04:39.706
and one convention special.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.804
Can I get you guys anything else?

04:41.881 --> 04:43.975
I am Zinaplox
from the planet Zedagon.

04:44.050 --> 04:47.645
I come to destroy humanity
and return to my home planet.

04:47.720 --> 04:52.749
Well, then it's really great that you're
starting out with a hearty breakfast.

Hi. Welcome to the Crashdown.
Can I show you to a table?

05:23.589 --> 05:25.523
A table would be lovely.

05:25.591 --> 05:27.787
- Jen?Table?
- Yeah, thanks.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.851
Here you go.

05:31.997 --> 05:34.932
So, can I get you
a beverage to start?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.934
A beverage would be lovely.

05:37.002 --> 05:38.595
Jen? Beverage?

05:38.671 --> 05:40.469
I'll have a Coke.

05:40.539 --> 05:44.533
You know, I would love
to try one of those delicious shakes...

05:44.610 --> 05:46.544
that you guys have.

05:46.612 --> 05:48.546
Let's see, which one do-

05:48.614 --> 05:50.605
Oh, this one looks interesting.

05:51.817 --> 05:53.808
Alien Encounter?

05:53.886 --> 05:55.752
Yeah.

05:55.821 --> 06:00.486
Okay, so we've got one Coke
and one Alien Encounter.

06:00.559 --> 06:02.926
- I'll just be right back.
- Thanks.

06:02.995 --> 06:05.862
Actually, you know what?
There is just... [Chuckles]

06:05.931 --> 06:07.922
One more little thing.

06:12.605 --> 06:15.597
Why don't you tell me what
really happened in September?

06:25.651 --> 06:28.848
Michael, I've got to talk to you
about something... personal.

06:28.921 --> 06:31.583
- Nothings too personal.
- How do you do it with Maria?

06:31.657 --> 06:35.423
- Too personal.
- No, I mean, how did you stop?

06:37.062 --> 06:39.326
I can't stop thinking about Liz.

06:39.398 --> 06:43.426
Every time I see her,
shejust starts going into slow motion.

06:43.502 --> 06:45.436

<i>It wasn't easy for me either, but you
gotta throw yourself into something.</i>

Somethingjust to
get your mind off her.

06:55.614 --> 06:57.548

06:57.616 --> 06:59.607
<i>[Shutter Clicks]</i>

07:03.088 --> 07:05.022

07:05.090 --> 07:07.024
- What's that, Milton?
- The energy.

07:07.092 --> 07:09.026
The synergy. It's kismet!

07:09.094 --> 07:11.028
Kismet?

07:11.096 --> 07:14.031
The sighting has attracted some
of the leading experts in the field.

07:14.099 --> 07:16.534
This is shaping up to be one of
the most important gatherings...

07:16.602 --> 07:18.536
on the paranormal in history.

07:18.604 --> 07:22.006
- We're not just a joke anymore, Evans.
- That's great, Milton.

07:22.074 --> 07:24.008
The problem is,
I'm overwhelmed here.

07:24.076 --> 07:26.010
The press
is buzzing around like flies...

07:26.078 --> 07:28.308
and the celebrities,
they're making my life a living hell.

07:28.380 --> 07:32.044
Oh, well, it's no wonder
my sciatic nerve is acting up.

07:32.117 --> 07:35.246
Well, maybe I could
take on more.

07:35.321 --> 07:38.416
- More?
- More work. More responsibilities.

07:38.490 --> 07:41.425
I've actually been looking
for something to throw myself into.

07:41.493 --> 07:44.019
I'm not gonna lie to you, Evans.

07:44.096 --> 07:46.087
I'm moved right now.

07:47.266 --> 07:50.327
I'm gonna give you more work
than you ever knew existed.

07:55.341 --> 07:57.275
“Alien Takedown“?

07:57.343 --> 07:59.778
What is that,
some sort of wrestling match?

07:59.845 --> 08:02.712
Yeah. The alien takedown.
You have a problem with that?

08:02.781 --> 08:04.715
You know what?
I do.

08:04.783 --> 08:07.218
I'm here trying to figure out
the meaning of my existence...

08:07.286 --> 08:09.721
and I'm tired of having to
wade through kooks like you...

08:09.788 --> 08:11.722
and freak shows like this to do it.

08:11.790 --> 08:14.725
Nothing personal, but this “freak show“
keeps my kooky daughter and myself...

08:14.793 --> 08:16.727
off the streets.

08:16.795 --> 08:18.729
Mom, Michael.
Michael, Mom.

08:18.797 --> 08:20.788
Nice to meet you.

08:22.968 --> 08:24.902
That was some guffaw.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.904
“Guffaw“?

08:26.972 --> 08:30.567
Yeah. My mother.
Great first impression.

08:30.643 --> 08:33.304
Why would I want to
make an impression?

08:35.648 --> 08:38.049
- Are you Max Evans?
- Yeah.

08:38.116 --> 08:40.051
- Oh, aren't you-
- Yes, I am.

08:40.119 --> 08:43.054
Milton said that you were
in charge of celebrity relations.

08:43.121 --> 08:45.056
WelLyeah, I guess I am.

08:45.124 --> 08:49.391
Then maybe you can explain why Shatner
and Stewart got suites and I didn't.

08:49.461 --> 08:51.395
The Tumbleweed only has two suites.

08:51.463 --> 08:53.898
And why wouldn't I
get one of them?

08:53.966 --> 08:57.402
- They signed on first, they got suites.
- Oh. That would explain it.

08:57.469 --> 08:59.904
Well, I'm gonna need a suite too.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.838
I don't think there are any.

09:01.907 --> 09:04.842
No, the right reply would be,
“I'll take care of it, Mr. Frakes.“

09:04.910 --> 09:06.844
Yeah, but I-l don't-

09:06.912 --> 09:09.313
I'll see what I can do?

09:10.416 --> 09:12.612
I'll move you to another motel.

09:12.685 --> 09:14.676
Thanks, Max.

09:15.421 --> 09:17.355
Evans.

09:17.423 --> 09:19.357
I want you to meet a legend.

09:19.425 --> 09:21.359
This is Everett Hubble.

09:21.427 --> 09:24.362
You are looking at
one of the few men in the world...

09:24.430 --> 09:26.159
rumored to have made
direct contact.

09:26.231 --> 09:29.826
Direct contact?
Sounds exciting.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.303
That's one way of looking at it.

09:32.371 --> 09:35.432
So, what did this alien look like?

09:35.507 --> 09:37.373
A little like you, actually.

09:39.378 --> 09:42.370
Or me. They're not
little green men, you know.

09:44.249 --> 09:48.186
<i>I'm tryin' to get Hub to participate in

<i>Nice little souvenir shop
you got goin' here, Miltie.</i>

09:57.196 --> 10:01.861

Get Hubble to do the roundtable.

<i>Disappeared almost 30 years ago.
Nobodys seen him since.</i>

10:58.057 --> 11:00.355
<i>I Boy]
So, why'd they kill the aliens?</i>

11:00.426 --> 11:02.292
What aliens?

11:02.361 --> 11:05.353
From the '47 crash.
Why'd they kill 'em?

11:05.431 --> 11:08.457
Well, maybe you should visit
our Theories on '47 exhibit.

11:08.534 --> 11:10.969
But I thought this was
the information booth.

11:11.036 --> 11:13.198
Well, yeah, it is, but-

11:24.016 --> 11:25.950
Mud.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.952
What?

11:28.020 --> 11:31.513
When you're with her, think about mud.
It helped me.

11:33.025 --> 11:36.017
I don't need some trick.
I can handle this.

11:38.997 --> 11:42.797
Hi. Um, I just wanted to talk to you
about the luncheon we're catering.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.893
Oh. Yeah.
If it's work-related, sure.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.904
It's just, I'm kinda busy.

11:46.972 --> 11:50.966
Okay, um, I'lljust-
Come over.

11:52.511 --> 11:54.502
It's just that, um...

11:56.548 --> 11:58.482
Larry andjennifer are back.

11:58.550 --> 12:01.417
You know, the ones that were there
the day that I got shot.

12:01.487 --> 12:04.752
Nowjennifer won't leave. She just
planted herself in the Crashdown.

12:04.823 --> 12:07.758
It's, like, she's been sitting there
for hours and hours.

12:07.826 --> 12:10.761
[Voice Echoes, Fades] It feels like
she's been watching me or something.

12:10.829 --> 12:14.697
<i>So I came to tell you that they're here,
in case anything should happen...</i>

12:14.766 --> 12:17.292
I wanted you to know.

12:17.369 --> 12:20.669
- Mud.
- What?

12:20.739 --> 12:22.673
Pie.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.675
Mud pie?

12:24.743 --> 12:27.678
For the lunch the Crashdown
is catering tomorrow.

12:27.746 --> 12:31.148
- I was thinking about mud pie.
- Okay.

12:31.216 --> 12:33.776
Um, I'll see if I can arrange it.

12:33.852 --> 12:36.378
I gotta go. I'm really busy.

12:36.455 --> 12:38.446
Okay.

12:47.199 --> 12:49.167
<i>Jim? Hi.</i>

12:49.234 --> 12:51.168
Hey. Amy-

12:51.236 --> 12:54.171
I didn't think U.F.O. conventions
were your cup of tea.

12:54.239 --> 12:57.174
- I'm just here to see a friend.
- Oh. [Chuckling]

12:57.242 --> 13:00.405
Um, I'll catch up
with you later, Amy.

13:03.582 --> 13:05.516
Isabel. Wow. Hey.

13:05.584 --> 13:07.518
So, you made it.

13:07.586 --> 13:09.520
You gotta stop
following me, Alex.

13:09.588 --> 13:12.649
Following you? Are you kidding me?
I just happened to be here.

13:12.724 --> 13:14.658
I mean, the whole town is here.

13:14.726 --> 13:17.718
Oh, good. You found Isabel.
He was looking for you.

13:23.168 --> 13:24.897
[Sighs]

13:32.177 --> 13:34.168
Lookin' for someone?

13:36.181 --> 13:39.116
What'd you come back
here for, Hubble?

13:39.184 --> 13:42.449
Well, I been trackin'
what's been going on around here...

13:42.521 --> 13:44.888
for the last few months.

13:44.957 --> 13:47.892
The shooting in September
at the Crashdown?

13:47.960 --> 13:49.894
What happened over there?

13:49.962 --> 13:53.398
You got to my father
when he was at his weakest...

13:53.465 --> 13:55.900
and you pushed him
over the edge.

13:55.968 --> 13:58.460
Because of you,
I had to have him committed.

13:58.537 --> 14:01.905
Well, now you're givin' me
more credit than I deserve.

14:01.974 --> 14:03.908
You get the hell outta here.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.910
I thought we already
talked about-

14:05.978 --> 14:08.913
I'm not talking to you
as the sheriff now.

14:08.981 --> 14:13.214
This is coming from me,
from everything you've cost me.

14:13.285 --> 14:16.220
<i>I don't ever wanna
have to see you again.</i>

14:16.288 --> 14:19.223
I understand you'd be upset,
but remember this-

14:19.291 --> 14:24.291
all those years your father's been
in that nuthouse, I been in my own hell.

14:24.496 --> 14:24.519
All those years your father's been
in that nuthouse, I been in my own hell.

14:24.629 --> 14:28.497
Now, from what I hear,
your dad isn't all there these days.

14:28.566 --> 14:32.127
But <i>I'll</i> bet you still
have a lot of questions...

14:32.203 --> 14:34.137
about your father...

14:34.205 --> 14:38.472
about that Silo murder
and why he was arrested.

14:38.543 --> 14:40.739
I'm the only person in the world...

14:40.812 --> 14:43.474
that has the answers
to those questions.

14:43.548 --> 14:45.448
I was there.

14:45.517 --> 14:47.451
I saw it all.

is go after me.

41:59.146 --> 42:01.240
You believe all these crazy things.

42:01.315 --> 42:03.579
You'rejust like Hubble!

42:03.650 --> 42:05.812
You want me?
Well, here I am!

42:07.988 --> 42:10.082
Take me.

42:10.157 --> 42:13.684
- Max, come on.just relax.
- No. No!

42:13.760 --> 42:14.989
Son-

42:15.062 --> 42:17.997
Would you treat your son this way?

42:22.936 --> 42:24.995
Get out of here.

42:25.072 --> 42:26.972
The both of you.

42:27.975 --> 42:30.410
YOU were HGVGI' hGFG.

42:31.411 --> 42:33.641
- Go on.
- Come on. Let's go.

42:38.619 --> 42:41.554
The guy was crazy, Max. He didn't
know what he was talking about.

42:41.622 --> 42:43.556
I don't think he was crazy.

42:43.624 --> 42:46.559
I think the one we've been
looking for has killed people.

42:46.627 --> 42:48.117
A lot of people.

42:53.367 --> 42:55.301
This is Sheriff Valenti.

42:55.369 --> 42:58.304
I've been involved in a code four.
I got one man down.

42:58.372 --> 43:01.808
My 10-20 is the abandoned Peppers Café
at Bitter Lake.
