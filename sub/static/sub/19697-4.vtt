00:24.100 --> 00:27.140
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

00:27.140 --> 00:28.620
On tonight's show,

00:28.620 --> 00:32.060
we've got a world exclusive
on four wheels and on two wheels.

00:32.060 --> 00:36.660
That's right, we're doing a bike.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:36.660 --> 00:40.300
But first, if you like
huge horsepower hypercars,

00:40.300 --> 00:43.220
and if you're watching this
it's safe to assume that you do,

00:43.220 --> 00:45.100
now is a great time to be alive.

00:45.100 --> 00:48.980
There's not a week that goes by
without another 1,000 horsepower,

00:48.980 --> 00:51.660
million-pound monster
appearing on the scene,

00:51.660 --> 00:53.060
but where did it all begin?

00:53.060 --> 00:56.820
Well, here's Chris Harris,
with a quick history lesson.

01:00.340 --> 01:04.420
Once upon a time, there was
a car called the Bugatti Veyron.

01:04.420 --> 01:06.500
Volkswagen's passion project,

01:06.500 --> 01:10.780
it launched in 2005
and promptly rewrote the rule book.

01:13.460 --> 01:17.660
Not only was it the world's fastest,
most powerful production car,

01:17.660 --> 01:21.020
it cost an unprecedented
one million Euros.

01:22.100 --> 01:25.900
This was hypercar 1.0 and,
without it, we might never

01:25.900 --> 01:29.540
have seen the likes
of the McLaren P1, the LaFerrari

01:29.540 --> 01:32.100
or the Porsche 918 Spyder.

01:34.540 --> 01:38.820
But now it's gone -
and been replaced by this.

01:41.980 --> 01:45.620
The new £2 million Bugatti Chiron.

01:49.060 --> 01:50.140
Like the Veyron,

01:50.140 --> 01:54.980
it has an eight-litre, 16-cylinder
engine, with four turbochargers.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.140
And because this is the car
to replace the Veyron,

02:00.140 --> 02:04.620
you would expect it to pack some
sort of extra futuristic shove.

02:05.940 --> 02:10.740
But you'd be wrong, because this
is basically a very modified Veyron.

02:10.740 --> 02:15.100
The same huge petrol engine,
four-wheel-drive system, gearbox -

02:15.100 --> 02:18.980
it's all been tinkered and improved,
but this is the old formula.

02:20.660 --> 02:25.860
So, if the Veyron was revolutionary,
the Chiron, I'm afraid, isn't.

02:25.860 --> 02:27.900
But it does have...

02:29.260 --> 02:32.500
..1,500 horsepower.

02:36.460 --> 02:41.100
And that...
Well, that's a really long runway.

02:42.100 --> 02:43.220
ENGINE ROARS

02:43.220 --> 02:44.580
I'm quite nervous.

02:45.820 --> 02:47.620
ENGINE PURRS

02:47.620 --> 02:50.260
I don't really know how you
prepare yourself for this,

02:50.260 --> 02:52.300
so I think you just go, don't you?

02:54.620 --> 02:56.100
Oh, my God!

02:57.220 --> 03:00.460
60. That's 100.

03:00.460 --> 03:03.340
That's 125, that took six seconds.

03:04.660 --> 03:08.220
That's 190. That's 200.

03:08.220 --> 03:10.700
215. I'm trying to read
the speed and look ahead.

03:10.700 --> 03:14.380
225. 228.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.420
231. 233.

03:19.220 --> 03:22.420
236 and that's the limit to there.

03:24.460 --> 03:29.300
That is absolutely mind-bending.

03:32.820 --> 03:34.580
I'm sorry, but that...

03:35.540 --> 03:36.700
..needs another go.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.100
This is looking insane.

03:46.140 --> 03:49.660
You can almost hear it
gulping down the fuel.

03:49.660 --> 03:54.060
The Veyron could empty its
100-litre fuel tank in 12 minutes.

03:54.060 --> 03:56.220
This thing can do it in nine!

03:58.060 --> 04:02.620
And the force
on those tyres - 3,800Gs!

04:02.620 --> 04:08.820
Which means at this speed,
the 12mg valve caps weigh 13.5kg.

04:12.700 --> 04:15.340
This is the edge of physics!

04:15.340 --> 04:17.100
At this speed,

04:17.100 --> 04:22.820
this Chiron is gulping
1,000 litres of air a second.

04:22.820 --> 04:25.900
Drink in, Mr Chiron!
Get it down you!

04:33.980 --> 04:36.500
That's a drug. That's a drug.

04:36.500 --> 04:40.300
I know it's just going fast
in a straight line, but...

04:40.300 --> 04:45.060
just the motive force required
to smash you through the air!

04:46.780 --> 04:50.860
Now, if you're thinking, hang on,
the Veyron goes quicker than 236,

04:50.860 --> 04:54.700
well, you'd be right,
but so does the Chiron.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.500
You see, the Chiron
is a two-key vehicle.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.180
The first key nestles in the
dashboard here and that gives

04:59.180 --> 05:02.380
you 236mph, but down here, there's
another one, if I can find it.

05:02.380 --> 05:04.260
There you go. Look at that.

05:04.260 --> 05:08.940
Put that and turn it down there
and you're allowed 261mph.

05:10.140 --> 05:12.980
And because Bugatti
is still testing the tyres,

05:12.980 --> 05:17.700
even that speed is still limited.
How fast will it go?

05:17.700 --> 05:20.860
270? Maybe 280?

05:20.860 --> 05:24.220
I think we can speculate that,
at some point during its life,

05:24.220 --> 05:28.260
the Chiron might well do 300mph.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.140
300mph.

05:33.860 --> 05:37.340
It goes like
a £2 million car should, then.

05:37.340 --> 05:39.860
But what about the way it looks?

05:39.860 --> 05:43.740
When I first saw pictures of the
Chiron, I was totally underwhelmed.

05:43.740 --> 05:47.500
It looked too much like a Veyron,
but now I'm here with it in the raw,

05:47.500 --> 05:51.740
I can get a sense of proportion and
the details, and it really works.

05:51.740 --> 05:55.860
This lovely C that houses the air
intakes, then round the back here,

05:55.860 --> 05:59.860
to this floating light bar,
massive diffuser and huge wing.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.780
It's a stunning-looking thing.

06:01.780 --> 06:05.420
The only problem is this
rather nasty 3 door handle,

06:05.420 --> 06:11.300
but otherwise, well, it looks
every inch the £2 million car.

06:11.300 --> 06:13.620
As does the interior.

06:13.620 --> 06:17.900
It isn't complicated by
huge screens or rows of unfathomable

06:17.900 --> 06:19.980
buttons and switches.

06:19.980 --> 06:24.540
Bugatti intends the Chiron
to be timeless... elegant.

06:24.540 --> 06:28.660
Then again, no-one ever criticised
the old Veyron for feeling cheap.

06:31.940 --> 06:35.900
But they did criticise it
for being a bit, well, dull.

06:37.220 --> 06:40.660
You see, it was admired,
but never really adored.

06:40.660 --> 06:46.020
It was so competent, so stable,
it all felt a bit joyless.

06:46.020 --> 06:50.300
With the Chiron though, Bugatti
has started to have some fun.

06:51.380 --> 06:53.620
To start with, it's got
adaptive dampers all round,

06:53.620 --> 06:55.740
so they can slacken off
and make the car comfortable

06:55.740 --> 06:59.140
when it needs to be, and firm
and responsive when it needs to be.

06:59.140 --> 07:02.740
And the steering is
a different world to the Veyron.

07:02.740 --> 07:06.060
It's now electromechanical,
it's into the wrists.

07:06.060 --> 07:11.020
The car now feels so much more
agile, but easier to place as well.

07:11.020 --> 07:13.540
It's got a front end
you can lean on.

07:13.540 --> 07:16.660
And with the four-wheel-drive
system revised, as well,

07:16.660 --> 07:19.100
there's even mention of the D word.

07:20.580 --> 07:23.820
Yes,
Bugatti says this thing will drift,

07:23.820 --> 07:26.420
so I suppose we'd better
find out, hadn't we?

07:29.020 --> 07:31.620
This is my
"BLEEP don't crash it" face.

07:39.540 --> 07:40.940
It's like wrestling a shark.

07:40.940 --> 07:42.660
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

07:49.460 --> 07:51.020
The traction is mega.

07:51.020 --> 07:53.820
All the power goes to the back
wheels, then it goes all

07:53.820 --> 07:57.060
to the front and you have
to just grab armfuls of lock.

08:01.900 --> 08:06.460
Rail breaker bit, get the rear
to rotate, then follow the gas on.

08:09.220 --> 08:11.260
HE CHUCKLES

08:14.820 --> 08:17.820
Yeah. You can drift the Chiron.

08:19.740 --> 08:22.860
Now, of course, I'm not saying
Bugatti has gone and built

08:22.860 --> 08:26.980
some P1 918 LaFerrari
baiting trap weapon.

08:28.020 --> 08:31.860
The truth is, the more time
you spend with the Chiron, the more

08:31.860 --> 08:34.980
you get the impression those
three upstarts don't even feature

08:34.980 --> 08:36.220
on its radar.

08:36.220 --> 08:39.900
What Bugatti has built here is
a car with a different purpose.

08:41.140 --> 08:46.500
Above all else, the Chiron
is about straightforward speed.

08:52.940 --> 08:56.660
And when it comes to speed,
it has no equals.

08:56.660 --> 08:58.940
You can talk about
which one of the McLaren,

08:58.940 --> 09:01.780
the Ferrari and the Porsche
you would buy, but you don't

09:01.780 --> 09:02.820
with the Chiron.

09:02.820 --> 09:07.740
You either buy a Chiron or no
Chiron. There is no competition.

09:09.740 --> 09:14.220
A class apart, then.
Well, the Chiron isn't the Veyron.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.660
It doesn't rewrite any rule
books or change the way we look

09:17.660 --> 09:18.860
at the automobile,

09:18.860 --> 09:21.820
but there's something
oddly appealing about that.

09:23.460 --> 09:26.340
This is no longer the Volkswagen
group trying to demonstrate

09:26.340 --> 09:28.780
its technological superiority.

09:28.780 --> 09:31.620
It just wanted
to go really, really fast.

09:31.620 --> 09:34.700
It wants to win at car
Top Trumps and that's

09:34.700 --> 09:38.140
a pleasingly,
pig-headed aim in my book.

09:43.540 --> 09:46.500
And talking
of going very, very fast...

09:48.700 --> 09:51.700
Come on. If you were me,
you would, wouldn't you?

10:03.140 --> 10:05.020
I'll never tire of this!

10:16.020 --> 10:17.460
Amazing.

10:17.460 --> 10:19.060
Amazing!

10:19.060 --> 10:21.940
I'm a very, very lucky boy.

10:21.940 --> 10:24.140
That's the fastest
I've ever been in a car.

10:24.140 --> 10:27.940
- OK, now, you hit the limiter at 236mph, right?
- Yeah.

10:27.940 --> 10:30.180
OK, so I've got to ask you,
you had the second key,

10:30.180 --> 10:33.620
why didn't you use the second key
and hit the limiter at 261?

10:33.620 --> 10:36.260
- I knew you'd ask that.
- Of course I'm going to ask you that.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.620
Look, this car
isn't quite finished yet.

10:38.620 --> 10:41.340
Bugatti's still working on it.
That's the reason it can't go

10:41.340 --> 10:44.140
- around our lap, by the way. It's not quite finished.
- OK.

10:44.140 --> 10:46.420
It's so complicated,
it's a leap into the unknown.

10:46.420 --> 10:49.220
They're still developing it
and I was, sort of, part of that

10:49.220 --> 10:52.260
- development process, actually.
- You are so selfless.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.580
LAUGHTER

10:53.580 --> 10:57.140
Risking your life for
the millionaires of the world.

10:57.140 --> 10:59.940
- I mean, it's amazing.
- It's not a millionaire's game,

10:59.940 --> 11:02.580
- this is a billionaire's game.
- Yeah!
- Let me give you some stats.

11:02.580 --> 11:08.820
- Bugatti tells us the average Chiron owner has 42 cars.
- OK.

11:08.820 --> 11:13.860
- Two yachts and 1.6 helicopters.
- LAUGHTER

11:16.820 --> 11:20.380
OK, which 0.6 of that second
helicopter do they have, though?

11:20.380 --> 11:22.860
- The expensive bit.
- OK.

11:22.860 --> 11:26.060
Anyhow, of all
the mind-bending stats,

11:26.060 --> 11:30.780
I think the tyres might be the
most mind-bending part of this car,

11:30.780 --> 11:33.100
because when Bugatti
developed this machine,

11:33.100 --> 11:35.420
it had to go faster than anything
else had gone before, so it

11:35.420 --> 11:36.860
went to Michelin and said,

11:36.860 --> 11:39.380
"We need a new tyre,"
and Michelin said, "OK."

11:39.380 --> 11:42.580
But they'd never tested
a tyre to 300mph before,

11:42.580 --> 11:46.260
so they had to test it on their
aircraft rig to get the tech right

11:46.260 --> 11:48.740
and that's how you have
to think of this car.

11:48.740 --> 11:53.740
- It's not so much a car, it's like a land-based jet.
- Yeah. All right,

11:53.740 --> 11:56.260
let's think of it that way.
And we're not done with the Chiron,

11:56.260 --> 11:59.780
because later in the show,
this car is taking part in a very,

11:59.780 --> 12:02.860
very special race. Trust me,
you don't want to miss that one.

12:02.860 --> 12:06.500
- Rory!
- That's right. This has the most horsepower

12:06.500 --> 12:10.620
of any Top Gear film ever
and that's not all, because,

12:10.620 --> 12:13.580
and I don't think I'm giving away
too much when I say that tonight's

12:13.580 --> 12:18.420
show also features an exclusive
appearance from the Smart Fortwo.

12:18.420 --> 12:21.700
- LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
Yeah.
- That's right.

12:26.300 --> 12:29.620
Now it's time to welcome
this week's guest. I love this guy.

12:29.620 --> 12:31.380
This is great. OK.

12:31.380 --> 12:35.700
He is the platinum-selling,
Brit Award-winning, chart-topping

12:35.700 --> 12:38.860
megastar who loves to go low.

12:38.860 --> 12:41.020
Ladies and gentlemen, Tinie Tempah!

12:41.020 --> 12:44.020
MUSIC: Girls Like
by Tinie Tempah

12:53.420 --> 12:56.580
- You all right?
- Yeah.

12:58.620 --> 13:01.180
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.
- Where do you want me, here?

13:01.180 --> 13:04.820
Yeah, right there is good. So glad
to have you here, right? Come on.

13:04.820 --> 13:07.580
- CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
- Finally! Finally!

13:07.580 --> 13:14.260
- Yeah, yeah. This isn't your first time here.
- No, it isn't, actually.

13:14.260 --> 13:17.820
So, basically, I was supposed
to shoot the video for the song

13:17.820 --> 13:21.660
Girls Like in Dunsfold,
I was supposed to shoot it here.

13:21.660 --> 13:24.940
And as soon as I got here,
it was rainy, rainy as hell.

13:24.940 --> 13:28.980
The light went by, like, 3pm or
4pm, so we couldn't do anything

13:28.980 --> 13:31.940
and then, by 6pm,
the director said it was a wrap.

13:31.940 --> 13:34.060
- I watched the video back
and it was absolutely - BLEEP.

13:34.060 --> 13:36.580
It's the worst video
I've ever seen.

13:36.580 --> 13:39.780
The worst video I've ever seen
in my life, so then we had to rush

13:39.780 --> 13:43.540
- over to South Africa, to do Top Gear, where we met.
- Yeah. Right.

13:43.540 --> 13:45.420
And then,
after we finished doing that,

13:45.420 --> 13:48.260
then I got to reshoot the video
in South Africa, so actually,

13:48.260 --> 13:52.300
Top Gear and Girls Like have a lot
of synergy, there's just a lot

13:52.300 --> 13:54.340
- there.
- Speaking of Girls Like,

13:54.340 --> 13:57.660
- that kind of became an unofficial Top Gear anthem.
- Oh, yes.

13:57.660 --> 13:58.900
On shoots, everywhere we go,

13:58.900 --> 14:01.660
you can always guarantee
this man is playing Girls Like.

14:01.660 --> 14:05.700
- You are in his head 24/7.
- I think he just likes to...

14:05.700 --> 14:07.700
I'm not sure he even likes the song,

14:07.700 --> 14:10.380
he just likes, "Go low,
go low. Everybody get low."

14:10.380 --> 14:11.780
- That's what he likes.
- I love it.

14:11.780 --> 14:14.420
- You're a bigger part of the show than you think.
- I appreciate that.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.820
- That's on the new album?
- Yeah, it's on the new album, Youth,

14:16.820 --> 14:18.460
coming out pretty soon
and I'm excited.

14:18.460 --> 14:20.500
I've been working
on it for two years.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.180
I'm like a Londoner,
it's an artist from the UK,

14:23.180 --> 14:25.900
born and bred in London
and I wanted to be

14:25.900 --> 14:29.580
a rapper when I was growing up
and everybody said it was naff.

14:29.580 --> 14:31.020
You could never be a rapper.

14:31.020 --> 14:34.580
A rapper would never get on the
radio or get on a show like this

14:34.580 --> 14:37.860
and times have changed. Youth
is basically a celebration of that,

14:37.860 --> 14:40.220
you know, just doing
something that wasn't really

14:40.220 --> 14:42.420
a thing before and it's a thing now.

14:42.420 --> 14:45.140
Speaking of growing up,
what was your first car?

14:45.140 --> 14:50.420
- Oh, OK, so my first car was a Vauxhall Corsa.
- Yes.
- 1.1.

14:50.420 --> 14:52.140
- Humble beginnings.
- Yes.

14:52.140 --> 14:55.780
Y reg, I remember
that very vividly and I used to...

14:55.780 --> 14:58.900
Outside my mum and dad's house there
was a driveway and I'd, literally,

14:58.900 --> 15:01.380
because I wanted to listen
to my music loud and stuff,

15:01.380 --> 15:03.060
I'd just keep
the car in the driveway,

15:03.060 --> 15:06.980
invite all my friends, technically,
to my house, but to the car,

15:06.980 --> 15:09.500
so they'd get, "No, no,
don't go in there. Come in here."

15:09.500 --> 15:10.980
And it was, literally, like,

15:10.980 --> 15:13.060
my little, kind of,
like, domain for a while.

15:13.060 --> 15:18.460
- What do you drive now?
- At the moment I'm driving the Lamborghini Huracan.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.340
- Nice.
- We talked about this.

15:20.340 --> 15:23.100
I thought
you were going to get a Porsche?

15:23.100 --> 15:24.260
Yeah, I kind of...

15:24.260 --> 15:27.860
I don't know, we spent a week
together and I realised that you was

15:27.860 --> 15:29.980
talking a lot, bro, and I was
listening to everything

15:29.980 --> 15:31.020
you was saying.

15:31.020 --> 15:34.980
You know you're with, like, Matt
LeBlanc, it's like, he's a legend.

15:34.980 --> 15:37.980
I'm just like, "Yes, Matt.
Of course, Matt. I will, Matt."

15:37.980 --> 15:40.540
And I got home and I was like,
"No, I don't want the Porsche."

15:40.540 --> 15:42.860
- "Screw what he said."
- Yeah, "Screw his advice."

15:42.860 --> 15:45.460
- And how do you like it?
- It's good, yeah. It's a good car.

15:45.460 --> 15:48.260
I'm quite glad he wasn't the guest
two weeks ago, when I was...

15:48.260 --> 15:51.340
less than kind
about the Lamborghini Huracan.

15:51.340 --> 15:52.660
What did you say about it, bruv?

15:52.660 --> 15:55.540
I said it was a wonderful car
for wonderful people.

15:55.540 --> 15:57.580
LAUGHTER

15:57.580 --> 15:59.580
And I went
and got it matted as well,

15:59.580 --> 16:01.180
so I got MATT black colour.

16:01.180 --> 16:02.340
Oh, thank you.

16:04.900 --> 16:06.620
OK, what do you think?

16:06.620 --> 16:08.700
Let's see how you did
in your training lap with Chris,

16:08.700 --> 16:13.220
who just finished his Tamsin
Greig school of social etiquette.

16:13.220 --> 16:16.020
- How did it go out there with him? Good?
- It was good, man.

16:16.020 --> 16:19.180
I've heard a lot
of bad things about you, bro.

16:19.180 --> 16:20.940
I've heard a lot
of bad things about Chris,

16:20.940 --> 16:22.340
so I wasn't looking forward to it.

16:22.340 --> 16:24.420
It was raining. It was raining,

16:24.420 --> 16:26.860
then we started getting a bit
of sunlight, but too much,

16:26.860 --> 16:29.700
so there was glare in the
windshield and I was thinking,

16:29.700 --> 16:32.860
"This is probably all
because of Chris, somehow."

16:32.860 --> 16:35.180
Like, he's just got...
There's just something about him.

16:35.180 --> 16:36.860
He brings misery to the role.

16:36.860 --> 16:39.700
Yeah, he brings misery,
but then I started to get upset

16:39.700 --> 16:43.740
and then, after that, I started
to realise that he has got a soft...

16:43.740 --> 16:45.580
quite a soft, sentimental side.

16:45.580 --> 16:48.020
Because as I started
to get quite worked up,

16:48.020 --> 16:51.340
he was immediately there,
to be like, "Don't worry, T..."

16:51.340 --> 16:54.860
- Who has a soft, sentimental side?
- Chris. This guy over here, yeah.

16:54.860 --> 16:57.100
I'm very giving.
Just watch the film.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.060
Whatever! OK, let's take a look.

17:00.660 --> 17:03.540
- Right, first gear, please.
- Right.
- First gear, please, Tinie.
- Cool.

17:03.540 --> 17:05.579
- Handbrake off, please.
- Nice and positive.

17:05.579 --> 17:08.099
- See, you like that?
- I love it.
- Now just get on with it, come on.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.460
- It's really slippery.
- Yeah.

17:14.460 --> 17:17.260
And we both want to go home
with all of our limbs, don't we?

17:17.260 --> 17:18.339
Yeah, nice and safe.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.540
- Feel that understeer, baby.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.460
- Now feel that oversteer on the exit.
- Yeah.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.339
- Whoa!
- Got it, got it, got it.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.620
Now you're alive. Got to
go left here at the blue line.

17:29.620 --> 17:31.580
To the left of the tyres.
Brake, brake, brake.

17:31.580 --> 17:34.140
- Remember, look for the red line now on your right-hand side.
- Yes.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.900
- It's there. It's there, it's there.
- Oh, spinning out.

17:36.900 --> 17:40.060
- Understeer, understeer, understeer.
- There we go. Am I within the line?

17:40.060 --> 17:42.540
- Is that cool?
- That's good, that's brilliant. Up here.

17:42.540 --> 17:45.260
- Let's go.
- Admittedly, begrudgingly...

17:45.260 --> 17:46.620
Come on! Come on!

17:48.380 --> 17:50.020
It's time for some tunes, man.

17:50.020 --> 17:52.980
RAP MUSIC PLAYS

17:55.300 --> 17:58.380
Brake, brake, brake, brake,
or we're off. Brake or we're off.

18:03.060 --> 18:05.980
You know, Toyota make an offroader,
as well. It's called a Land Cruiser.

18:05.980 --> 18:08.060
- Is it?
- It's not this one, though.
- Oh, OK.

18:08.060 --> 18:10.020
I'll bear
that in mind for next time.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.900
- Good Lord!
- I've got it.

18:13.900 --> 18:16.820
- And over the line.
- Over the line!
- Yes!

18:16.820 --> 18:20.180
- You nearly braked before the line!
- The pressure's too much, man.

18:20.180 --> 18:22.380
I don't know
if I can deal with this.

18:22.380 --> 18:24.540
I'm going to get
high blood pressure. Come on.

18:24.540 --> 18:26.180
# I'm a boss... #

18:26.180 --> 18:29.300
How did you do it?
Teach me the dance move.

18:29.300 --> 18:33.420
Look at this one. Do this one.
Just a slow one. Just a slow one.

18:33.420 --> 18:34.860
This is about my Lamborghini.

18:34.860 --> 18:36.100
# My Lamborghini... #

18:36.100 --> 18:38.140
Yeah, just have
to dance like a grandad now.

18:38.140 --> 18:40.980
- That's all you have to do.
- Your Lamborghini looks like a shark?

18:40.980 --> 18:43.060
Yeah,
my Lamborghini looks like Jaws.

18:45.540 --> 18:47.540
CHEERING

18:53.860 --> 18:56.420
What was that dance
you were doing in the car?

18:57.740 --> 18:59.060
I don't really understand.

18:59.060 --> 19:02.020
I was taking some lessons
from Tinie about how I should dance

19:02.020 --> 19:03.940
and he said, very reassuringly,

19:03.940 --> 19:06.660
"Dance as you want to. Be a
grandpa." So I thought, OK, I would.

19:06.660 --> 19:08.780
I mean, obviously,
when my children see that,

19:08.780 --> 19:12.060
that's just going to be appalling,
but I tried my hardest.

19:12.060 --> 19:15.260
Look, he dealt very well with the
conditions, because it was so wet

19:15.260 --> 19:18.060
it was flooded. The tyre
wouldn't deal with the water,

19:18.060 --> 19:19.300
so we were aquaplaning,

19:19.300 --> 19:22.540
and then, the sun came out, so
he couldn't see where the line was.

19:22.540 --> 19:25.700
- It was just like a glass surface, wasn't it?
- It wasn't easy, bro.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.100
- It was tough.
- Yeah, that was wet.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.980
We'll see how you did
in your timed lap.

19:28.980 --> 19:30.780
- We'll check that out later on.
- Cool.

19:30.780 --> 19:34.740
Now, usually these two get to
hoon about in Ferraris and Lambos

19:34.740 --> 19:36.660
and such,
but a couple of months ago,

19:36.660 --> 19:39.900
the producers told me
there was a new rear engine,

19:39.900 --> 19:43.420
rear-wheel drive sports car
that I should take a look at.

19:43.420 --> 19:47.460
Maybe a rival for the Porsche 911.
So, I went to check it out.

19:56.700 --> 20:01.820
And this is that rear-engined,
rear-wheel drive sports car. Yeah.

20:03.260 --> 20:05.340
I've been stitched
up here, haven't I?

20:08.660 --> 20:11.260
It's called the Renault Twingo GT.

20:11.260 --> 20:13.380
And, yeah, like the Porsche 911,

20:13.380 --> 20:15.500
it does have
the engine in the back.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.420
And, like the Porsche 911,

20:17.420 --> 20:19.620
that engine
does drive the rear wheel.

20:20.700 --> 20:24.740
But I'm calling foul on the
whole sports car thing, I'm sorry.

20:24.740 --> 20:26.940
What sport?

20:26.940 --> 20:29.380
What is sporty about this?

20:29.380 --> 20:31.900
Well, right now, not a lot.

20:31.900 --> 20:36.780
Even on a dry day, 0-60 takes
over 9.5 seconds and it's got

20:36.780 --> 20:40.060
a top speed of just 113mph.

20:40.060 --> 20:42.580
Those are not numbers
to worry Porsche.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.380
They're not numbers to worry anyone.

20:45.820 --> 20:49.460
But according to Renault,
this really is a sports car.

20:50.820 --> 20:54.540
Compared to the standard Twingo,
the one driven by your nan,

20:54.540 --> 20:56.500
the GT has bigger alloys,

20:56.500 --> 20:59.580
firmer suspension
and twin tailpipes.

20:59.580 --> 21:03.740
And, on the left-hand side only,
a small intake, which feeds

21:03.740 --> 21:07.220
cool air into the three-cylinder,
turbo-charged engine,

21:07.220 --> 21:09.140
which makes 20% more power.

21:18.340 --> 21:21.620
All right, that still
only gives it 108 horsepower.

21:23.660 --> 21:25.620
But that doesn't actually matter,

21:25.620 --> 21:29.180
because this Twingo is
a different kind of sports car.

21:29.180 --> 21:32.620
It doesn't need power. It weighs
less than a ton. It's light.

21:34.020 --> 21:37.980
And the GT costs
under £14,000, so it's cheap.

21:40.060 --> 21:42.340
This is a baby hot hatch.

21:46.380 --> 21:48.620
And that is a very good thing.

21:49.820 --> 21:51.740
Because unlike a big hot hatch...

21:53.820 --> 21:56.580
..you're not paying
for anything you can't use.

21:56.580 --> 21:57.860
Ha-ha!

21:59.460 --> 22:02.420
Your Ford Focus RSes
and your Golf Rs and the like,

22:02.420 --> 22:04.900
great cars,
but they're so damn fast.

22:04.900 --> 22:06.340
In Britain at least,

22:06.340 --> 22:10.740
you can only use a fraction of their
firepower a fraction of the time.

22:10.740 --> 22:12.900
Not in the Twingo, though.

22:12.900 --> 22:16.180
You can keep your foot
buried for 20, 30 seconds,

22:16.180 --> 22:19.740
safe in the knowledge
that it's not going to kill you.

22:19.740 --> 22:22.780
It's one of those cars
that encourages you to drive

22:22.780 --> 22:24.380
like an absolute hooligan

22:24.380 --> 22:27.900
and, yet, you always stay
on the right side of the law.

22:27.900 --> 22:29.300
HE LAUGHS

22:29.300 --> 22:31.940
It's just a really
rewarding car to drive.

22:34.660 --> 22:37.060
OK, it's not a Porsche,
but it is good.

22:38.660 --> 22:41.820
So, yes, if your name's
Chris Harris and you commute to work

22:41.820 --> 22:45.020
sideways over empty,
sweeping moorland B-roads,

22:45.020 --> 22:49.420
the Twingo IS going
to leave you a bit cold.

22:49.420 --> 22:52.940
But because you're not Chris Harris,
and, thank God, neither am I,

22:52.940 --> 22:57.900
we don't commute to work over
empty, sweeping moorland B-roads.

22:57.900 --> 22:59.860
We spend most of our time...

23:01.140 --> 23:02.180
..in the city.

23:03.660 --> 23:06.460
And that is what
the Twingo is all about.

23:06.460 --> 23:10.420
Because there's no oily,
petrolly, motory stuff jammed in

23:10.420 --> 23:13.740
by the front wheels, I can
get an insane amount of lock on.

23:14.820 --> 23:18.940
That means it's a cinch to park.
It also means I'm agile, I'm nippy.

23:18.940 --> 23:21.820
I'm like a big,
orange hummingbird on wheels.

23:24.820 --> 23:28.100
What I'm saying is,
you don't need loads of horsepower

23:28.100 --> 23:29.780
to have a good time.

23:29.780 --> 23:32.660
Remember the Peugeot 205 GTi
from the '80s?

23:32.660 --> 23:35.100
One of the best
hot hatches of all time.

23:36.340 --> 23:40.380
And yet, the Twingo GT
has almost exactly the same power

23:40.380 --> 23:41.660
and performance.

23:42.780 --> 23:44.940
This car is retro.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.100
And I do love a bit of retro.

23:50.380 --> 23:53.940
The thing is, if you're
after a playful little city car

23:53.940 --> 23:57.860
with that old school appeal,
the Twingo does have its rivals.

23:58.980 --> 24:01.380
And helping find
the right car for you

24:01.380 --> 24:04.260
is something we take very seriously.

24:04.260 --> 24:05.420
Oh, yes.

24:05.420 --> 24:09.740
Welcome to what, for legal reasons,
I'm obliged to refer to as

24:09.740 --> 24:14.340
the Top Gear arcade-based
maze re-creation challenge.

24:18.260 --> 24:22.860
Yes, like all classic arcade games,
here, the rules are simple.

24:22.860 --> 24:26.340
There's a big maze covered in dots
and me and the Twingo

24:26.340 --> 24:29.620
have three lives to drive
around eating said dots

24:29.620 --> 24:32.180
without getting got by the ghosts.

24:32.180 --> 24:36.540
And by ghosts, I do mean
similarly-priced city car rivals.

24:38.780 --> 24:41.780
Ghost number one
is the Brabus ForTwo.

24:41.780 --> 24:44.780
It has the same engine
and performance as the Twingo

24:44.780 --> 24:47.940
but only has
two doors, two seats and,

24:47.940 --> 24:52.140
for tonight at least,
is being driven by a speedy German.

24:52.140 --> 24:54.700
I see you, man pack.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.780
No, it's not man pack,
it's... Never mind.

24:57.780 --> 25:00.980
Ghost number two
is the new Volkswagen Up!

25:00.980 --> 25:04.700
Yes, it might be five years old,
but the king of modern city cars

25:04.700 --> 25:08.340
now comes with a turbocharger,
to give it more zip -

25:08.340 --> 25:11.140
especially in the hands
of Mr Happy here.

25:11.140 --> 25:14.380
Rory, do you know what
corrugated steel tastes like?

25:14.380 --> 25:17.580
I'm sorry, did they have arcade
games when you were growing up?

25:17.580 --> 25:20.180
Or were you part of
the stick and hoop generation?

25:20.180 --> 25:23.100
Less talky, more smashy.

25:23.100 --> 25:26.500
'Right, three lives
to eat up all the dots

25:26.500 --> 25:29.940
'and one handy sat nav map,
to help me find them.'

25:29.940 --> 25:32.340
Get ready
for an arcade masterclass.

25:35.540 --> 25:37.140
See you later, suckers!

25:37.140 --> 25:39.540
He's going left! Follow, Harris!

25:39.540 --> 25:41.300
Catch me if you can, losers!

25:41.300 --> 25:44.260
Give me them dots,
give me them tasty dots.

25:44.260 --> 25:46.380
Yummy, yummy, yummy, come on.

25:46.380 --> 25:47.420
This is good fun!

25:49.940 --> 25:53.860
One thing I've got on my side
is that this is the most

25:53.860 --> 25:56.140
manoeuvrable car of the bunch.

25:57.380 --> 26:00.420
A little car.
Such a tiny little thing.

26:01.580 --> 26:04.020
And for this job, just perfect.

26:04.020 --> 26:07.740
Now, officially,
the Up! is the cheapest car here,

26:07.740 --> 26:09.420
but it has the highest top speed.

26:09.420 --> 26:12.340
'Which is of no use
in an arcade maze.'

26:12.340 --> 26:13.540
Handbrake!

26:15.340 --> 26:17.660
Yes! Whoo!

26:17.660 --> 26:19.380
- That was - BLEEP - great.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.740
Oh, yes.

26:23.740 --> 26:27.300
This is the best
city car, bar none.

26:27.300 --> 26:30.900
Oh, no, no, no! Come on!

26:30.900 --> 26:33.180
- Come on!
- SHE CACKLES

26:33.180 --> 26:35.020
I'm dead. Already!

26:36.380 --> 26:41.100
OK, two lives left, and with nearly
a third of the maze cleared,

26:41.100 --> 26:43.380
lots of dots still to eat.

26:43.380 --> 26:45.860
Rory,
be a bit less rubbish this time.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.700
HE LAUGHS

26:52.220 --> 26:54.860
We're off. Here we go, here we go.

26:54.860 --> 26:57.140
Don't let them beat you, man.
Don't let them beat you!

26:57.140 --> 26:59.180
I'm right behind you.
Right behind you!

26:59.180 --> 27:01.060
Oh, Harris is quick!

27:01.060 --> 27:03.180
- He's quick!
- Go, Harris!

27:03.180 --> 27:05.780
'Immediately, the ghosts
were closing in again.'

27:05.780 --> 27:07.420
Go, go, go!

27:07.420 --> 27:10.380
'But no retro arcade game would
be complete without the odd...'

27:10.380 --> 27:12.020
Here we go! '..power up.'

27:13.100 --> 27:15.220
- Ha-ha!
- Whoo!

27:15.220 --> 27:18.460
- You hit me!
- What are you doing? What's the red light thing?

27:18.460 --> 27:21.660
The red light means stop, Grandad.

27:21.660 --> 27:24.300
'And that gave me
ten whole seconds...

27:25.660 --> 27:27.100
'Of ghost-free dot-munching.'

27:28.420 --> 27:32.100
I am on a dot spree now, baby.

27:32.100 --> 27:33.940
I think you'll find
they're called biscuits.

27:33.940 --> 27:36.820
Literally,
nobody calls them biscuits.

27:36.820 --> 27:38.380
Well, except old people.

27:39.660 --> 27:43.420
- Oh, we can go again.
- Let's go!
- Now we're blocked in.

27:44.860 --> 27:45.980
Whoa!

27:47.140 --> 27:50.900
Oh, the turning circle!
The turning circle!

27:50.900 --> 27:54.060
I haven't quite got the turning
circle of a Twingo, have I?

27:56.740 --> 28:01.380
Oh, delicious dots.
Delicious dots! Mine!

28:01.380 --> 28:05.500
'And with Harris still halfway
through his million-point turn...'

28:05.500 --> 28:07.500
I'm not going to catch
anyone at this rate, am I?

28:07.500 --> 28:10.380
'..I tried a new tactic. Stealth.'

28:10.380 --> 28:11.860
Stay under the radar.

28:13.340 --> 28:16.620
- Off the grid.
- Ah, we're away. Right, come on.

28:16.620 --> 28:18.340
Where is he?

28:18.340 --> 28:20.820
Think stealth. Think ninja.

28:20.820 --> 28:22.820
Rory! Where are you?

28:22.820 --> 28:24.740
He's hiding. We'll find him.

28:24.740 --> 28:26.220
I'm right behind him.

28:26.220 --> 28:28.340
I'm right behind him.
He doesn't even know.

28:29.900 --> 28:32.780
'Yep, my awesome ninja
stealth skills let me sneak in

28:32.780 --> 28:35.100
'a few more dots before...'

28:35.100 --> 28:36.580
I got him, I got him!

28:37.780 --> 28:39.820
HE LAUGHS

28:39.820 --> 28:41.140
Yeah, I can see him.

28:41.140 --> 28:43.180
Run away! Run away!

28:43.180 --> 28:45.660
'The city car ghosts
were back in the hunt.'

28:46.780 --> 28:48.940
I'm going to catch you, Reid.

28:48.940 --> 28:51.260
Which way? Which way?
Which way? Which way? Which way?

28:51.260 --> 28:53.580
- Got him!
- No, no, no!

28:53.580 --> 28:55.100
Oh!

28:55.100 --> 28:56.140
Mate!

28:56.140 --> 28:58.020
HE CHUCKLES

28:58.020 --> 29:00.620
Dude, it's a brand-new Twingo!

29:00.620 --> 29:02.740
'You're better than this, Reid.

29:02.740 --> 29:05.060
'Right, still a load of dots left.

29:05.060 --> 29:08.020
'Last life, no continues.'

29:08.020 --> 29:10.820
Rory, just give up.
You're not going to win.

29:10.820 --> 29:14.020
Come on, Twingo, help me
out here. Please, please, please.

29:21.180 --> 29:23.020
You can do this, you can do this!

29:23.020 --> 29:25.780
'Game time.
Hunting out the last of the dots.'

29:27.140 --> 29:29.660
You're not supposed
to wreck all the lights, Reid.

29:29.660 --> 29:33.500
'The Twingo and I were using
every trick in the arcade manual...'

29:33.500 --> 29:35.460
Dots, dots, I need dots. Come on.

29:35.460 --> 29:37.020
'..which isn't even a thing..

29:38.140 --> 29:39.180
Oops.

29:39.180 --> 29:41.580
All right, we've got to stop him
getting these last biscuits.

29:41.580 --> 29:42.860
I have an idea.

29:43.980 --> 29:47.300
Come on, Twingo!
Come on! Yes, yes!

29:47.300 --> 29:48.740
The last dots! Come on!

29:48.740 --> 29:53.100
'We were nearly there, but with the
last dots almost within reach...'

29:53.100 --> 29:56.660
That's them.
The last dots. Let's go.

29:57.900 --> 29:59.140
Argh!

29:59.140 --> 30:00.860
'..Sabine had set up a dot block.'

30:00.860 --> 30:02.380
Sneaky German ghost!

30:02.380 --> 30:03.860
SHE SQUEALS

30:05.340 --> 30:08.540
Oh, no, you don't,
Mr French shopping trolley.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.860
Ha-ha! Ken Block who?

30:12.860 --> 30:15.220
Good skills.

30:15.220 --> 30:17.180
Ah, yes!

30:17.180 --> 30:18.820
- Oh, no!
- Here we go, here we go!

30:18.820 --> 30:21.420
Yes! Nearly there, Twingo!

30:21.420 --> 30:23.220
That's them - the last dots!

30:23.220 --> 30:24.820
Yes! Yes!

30:24.820 --> 30:26.180
Go!

30:27.620 --> 30:30.020
Yes! Yes!

30:30.020 --> 30:31.500
We did it! We did it!

30:31.500 --> 30:34.020
Oh, look,
he's doing a victory doughnut.

30:34.020 --> 30:35.700
HE LAUGHS

30:35.700 --> 30:38.580
In your face!

30:38.580 --> 30:40.180
It's not really a doughnut, is it?

30:40.180 --> 30:42.900
More of a kind of crap teacake.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.780
RORY LAUGHS

30:46.340 --> 30:48.340
In your face!

30:55.940 --> 31:00.060
- Victory for the Twingo!
- Victory for the Twingo.

31:00.060 --> 31:02.900
That was... That was great.

31:02.900 --> 31:04.260
That was great.

31:04.260 --> 31:07.300
You know, not a day goes
by where I don't find myself

31:07.300 --> 31:09.820
trapped in a maze of shipping
containers and wonder,

31:09.820 --> 31:12.300
"What would be the best car
to help me escape?"

31:12.300 --> 31:14.380
- Yeah, exactly.
- Now I know.
- Exactly, exactly.

31:14.380 --> 31:16.500
You know what I like
about the Twingo, right?

31:16.500 --> 31:19.100
It's the fact that all city cars
were, kind of, all becoming the

31:19.100 --> 31:21.900
same, they were becoming clones,
but the Twingo is a different way

31:21.900 --> 31:23.420
of answering the question.

31:23.420 --> 31:26.380
It's not the front-wheel drive,
it's not, kind of, boxy.

31:26.380 --> 31:28.860
All right, it's not perfect
but it's got character.

31:28.860 --> 31:31.260
And when you want to go somewhere,
you just pop it in the boot

31:31.260 --> 31:34.140
of your real car and off you go.

31:34.140 --> 31:37.300
OK, now it's time to find
out which of these teeny, tiny cars

31:37.300 --> 31:39.100
is fastest around our track,

31:39.100 --> 31:42.020
and that means handing
them over for testing.

31:42.020 --> 31:45.780
Not by The Stig,
but by The Stig's teenage cousins.

31:49.100 --> 31:51.980
So, there they all are,
standing around Snapchatting,

31:51.980 --> 31:54.220
photo bombing, looking for
Pokemon Go...

31:54.220 --> 31:57.100
And off the line, the Twingo,
rear-engine traction,

31:57.100 --> 31:59.060
has got a little bit
of a march there.

31:59.060 --> 32:02.100
There's no room up the inside for
that particular adolescent lunatic.

32:02.100 --> 32:05.460
Oh, my God. Imagine what's inside
that helmet - all the acne.

32:05.460 --> 32:07.660
AUDIENCE LAUGHTER

32:09.820 --> 32:13.660
Right, turning in, there's not
enough room for you there.

32:13.660 --> 32:15.180
Oh, dangerous - headphones on.

32:15.180 --> 32:17.260
What are they listening to?
Tinie Tempah, maybe.

32:17.260 --> 32:19.820
Some cool tunes.
OK, this is worrying now because

32:19.820 --> 32:22.140
there's not room for two of them
going in here.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.980
The Up looking a bit sneaky
at the back there.

32:24.980 --> 32:27.140
A tighter line... This is clever.

32:27.140 --> 32:29.260
..and he's going
to get the march on the Smart

32:29.260 --> 32:30.780
coming down the back straight.

32:30.780 --> 32:33.980
They don't look very fast, do
they? No, not in a straight line.

32:33.980 --> 32:36.100
What's he doing there?

32:36.100 --> 32:39.460
I don't know, talking to his
pals on Face Chat thing...

32:39.460 --> 32:42.580
OK, breaking hard
down into the Hammerhead.

32:42.580 --> 32:43.900
What's going to happen here?

32:43.900 --> 32:47.300
Well, the Up has got
a massive advantage because...

32:47.300 --> 32:49.820
I think because it's front-engined,
it looked better.

32:49.820 --> 32:51.980
But look at that sneaky
git on the inside there.

32:51.980 --> 32:54.100
Three abreast.
I don't how this is going to end.

32:54.100 --> 32:57.860
This looks like a massive insurance
claim in waiting, doesn't it?

32:59.180 --> 33:01.300
So let's go through
the Follow-Through...

33:01.300 --> 33:02.740
Oh, that's rude! That's rude!

33:02.740 --> 33:04.940
He's cut him right
off at the nose there.

33:04.940 --> 33:08.060
And that Smart just looks
unstable to me... It looks so short.

33:08.060 --> 33:09.820
So short. OK...

33:09.820 --> 33:13.140
Oh, that's a
buttock-clenching moment there.

33:13.140 --> 33:15.380
But the Smart's
got the run on the Twingo

33:15.380 --> 33:17.500
heading down towards second-to-last.

33:17.500 --> 33:18.820
Really unstable under breaks -

33:18.820 --> 33:20.620
I don't know what
they're playing at here.

33:20.620 --> 33:22.340
I think the
Twingo's got this wrapped up.

33:22.340 --> 33:25.540
Second-to-last, Twingo runs wide.
Carry... That's just rude!

33:25.540 --> 33:28.540
OK, that's rude! So effectively,
a moral victory to the Renault

33:28.540 --> 33:30.460
because he had
to get out of the way,

33:30.460 --> 33:33.900
otherwise he'd
have crashed into that Stig.

33:38.980 --> 33:42.380
All right, now, because
that got a bit out of hand,

33:42.380 --> 33:45.740
we also got The Stig himself
to lap all three cars.

33:45.740 --> 33:48.340
Now, only the fastest one of the
three earns a place

33:48.340 --> 33:54.500
on the leaderboard, and that
was the Smart in 1.49.1.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.180
Which is...

33:56.180 --> 33:57.980
a way down there. OK...

33:57.980 --> 34:00.020
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

34:05.740 --> 34:07.660
- I told you.
- All right, now...

34:07.660 --> 34:09.860
Hold on, hold on. I want to
talk about the internet

34:09.860 --> 34:11.300
- for a second...
- Yes.

34:11.300 --> 34:14.500
..because I hear that you
and Chris Harris have the same

34:14.500 --> 34:18.900
favourite website, which I've got
to say, I find hard to believe

34:18.900 --> 34:21.300
because I know Chris
and he's disgusting!

34:22.300 --> 34:24.900
Oh, we definitely do, then.
No, I'm joking!

34:24.900 --> 34:28.020
No, my favourite website
is actually Auto Trader, bro.

34:28.020 --> 34:30.420
- I love it. Do you love Auto Trader?
- Yeah, I'm addicted.

34:30.420 --> 34:32.500
I love it.
Ever since I've been a kid...

34:32.500 --> 34:35.380
For me, I grew up in, like,
a council estate, south-east London,

34:35.380 --> 34:39.219
didn't have much, so being able to
go online and look at all these cars

34:39.219 --> 34:41.420
at all these ridiculous prices...

34:41.420 --> 34:45.540
I used to type in
"£200,000, £1 million,

34:45.540 --> 34:47.060
"let's see what cars come up."

34:47.060 --> 34:49.219
And you'd see all these rare
cars, and I just...

34:49.219 --> 34:51.860
I was obsessed with it. So, yeah,
it's my favourite website.

34:51.860 --> 34:54.940
- OK. And that's your favourite website, too?
- It is, yes.

34:54.940 --> 34:58.820
To avoid any confusion,
that is my favourite website.

34:58.820 --> 35:02.420
What's you second...?
No, never mind! Let's not do that.

35:02.420 --> 35:05.820
Tinie, I heard you enjoy an
Aston Martin.

35:05.820 --> 35:08.340
Yeah, bro. I... Oh, God!

35:08.340 --> 35:12.060
So I... Luckily, when
they launched the One-77

35:12.060 --> 35:14.180
they invited me down
to be factory.

35:14.180 --> 35:17.700
So they said to me, "Do you want
to borrow one for a week?"

35:17.700 --> 35:20.780
So I borrowed the
Aston Martin Virage

35:20.780 --> 35:25.260
and I remember rolling around like
just the coolest kid in the world.

35:25.260 --> 35:27.780
I was like 23 years old at the time

35:27.780 --> 35:30.540
and I was dating this girl
at the time,

35:30.540 --> 35:34.220
and so when she saw the car,
and she was in the car,

35:34.220 --> 35:36.700
she got really, really giddy
and excited.

35:36.700 --> 35:39.900
And she said, "We should celebrate.
We should..."

35:39.900 --> 35:41.700
LAUGHTER

35:41.700 --> 35:44.100
- Should what?
- Yeah.
- Should what?
- What? What? What?

35:45.820 --> 35:48.140
Don't make this harder
than it already is, please.

35:48.140 --> 35:49.940
- But, yeah...
- Is that what you said to her?

35:49.940 --> 35:52.260
Choose your words more carefully.

35:58.820 --> 36:00.620
That Aston Martin badge, I told you.

36:00.620 --> 36:04.140
Yeah, I felt like James Bond for,
like, 20 seconds, which was great.

36:04.140 --> 36:05.940
20 seconds?

36:07.140 --> 36:09.780
The good thing is, they don't make
the Virage any more

36:09.780 --> 36:11.220
because I don't want to borrow one.

36:11.220 --> 36:14.460
Yeah, don't ever buy... Like,
if you see used one floating around,

36:14.460 --> 36:17.180
- don't get that one.
- What do you think?

36:17.180 --> 36:19.740
I think it's time to take a look
at Tinie's lap around the track.

36:19.740 --> 36:22.060
- Who wants to see that?
AUDIENCE: - Yeah!

36:22.060 --> 36:24.700
- Let's do it. Yeah?
- How do you think it went? How did you think you did?

36:24.700 --> 36:27.340
I think it was cool. I mean,
I don't really know how I did.

36:27.340 --> 36:28.580
And it was a swamp out there.

36:28.580 --> 36:31.620
Yeah, the conditions were horrible,
but I'm not going to be a moaner.

36:31.620 --> 36:35.060
- I'm not going to make excuses.
- All right, let's take a look.

36:37.060 --> 36:39.060
Off the line.

36:39.060 --> 36:41.060
It's time to make the family proud.

36:43.500 --> 36:46.020
It's a freezing day in England,
but I'm actually sweating.

36:46.020 --> 36:48.980
It's nerves, I've got gas today.

36:48.980 --> 36:51.460
LAUGHTER

36:51.460 --> 36:54.780
OK, well, you're using most
of the circuit, that's good.

36:54.780 --> 36:59.180
Third gear...
Look, at the flooding there!

36:59.180 --> 37:02.460
- Wetter than... What was going on there?
- Whoa!

37:02.460 --> 37:06.660
That was properly lairy. A bit of
understeer here. Get on the gas.

37:06.660 --> 37:09.820
- A bit of oversteer on the exit.
- Come on, son!

37:09.820 --> 37:12.740
You're letting it just dance
around, aren't you?

37:12.740 --> 37:16.460
- Braking hard now into Hammerhead.
- It's started to rain again.

37:16.460 --> 37:18.300
You're really not...

37:18.300 --> 37:20.340
Really trying to rain
on my parade.

37:22.580 --> 37:24.100
SCREECHING

37:24.100 --> 37:27.820
Oi, oi! It's all about
the smoothness, T.

37:27.820 --> 37:31.140
It's all about the smoothness.

37:31.140 --> 37:33.940
Smoother than a baby's bottom.
Come on.

37:33.940 --> 37:36.020
OK, coming down now
to the Follow-Through.

37:36.020 --> 37:37.940
This is going to be tough.

37:37.940 --> 37:40.980
I think I've just
farted out of nervousness.

37:40.980 --> 37:44.340
I don't know what to say about that.

37:44.340 --> 37:47.260
That is a massive moment!

37:47.260 --> 37:50.700
Do you know what that face is?
That the new underwear face.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.860
So we're going to roll
into Second-to-last.

37:52.860 --> 37:55.540
It's slippery here.
You got that one right that time.

37:55.540 --> 37:57.540
Breaking hard, keeping it tight.
Do you know what?

37:57.540 --> 37:59.620
I think that was the toughest
conditions so far

37:59.620 --> 38:01.700
for any of our drivers
over the line.

38:01.700 --> 38:04.820
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

38:09.020 --> 38:12.220
- That face!
- Are you happy with that? What do you think?

38:12.220 --> 38:16.300
It's weird because it feels a lot
faster than it looked on the screen.

38:16.300 --> 38:18.940
- Yeah, always.
- So while I was driving, it felt way faster

38:18.940 --> 38:21.740
and there it didn't really look
that fast, but, I don't know.

38:21.740 --> 38:23.180
Who knows, bro? I don't know.

38:23.180 --> 38:25.620
Yeah, the same thing happens
to me in performances.

38:25.620 --> 38:27.660
It always looks a lot
better when I'm doing it

38:27.660 --> 38:29.580
then what it actually looks like.

38:29.580 --> 38:31.780
You watch it back and you're like...

38:31.780 --> 38:34.740
All right, now, the top of our
leaderboard is still Max Whitlock,

38:34.740 --> 38:37.460
the iconic gymnast.
You give that guy a foam horse

38:37.460 --> 38:40.900
covered in suede and he just gives
you poetry. Is it not nice...?

38:40.900 --> 38:44.100
- Incredible.
- But, because it was so wet, you have a wet time,

38:44.100 --> 38:48.140
so you have to beat
James McAvoy's time of 1.47.1.

38:48.140 --> 38:50.660
Don't say it like,
"You only have to beat..."

38:50.660 --> 38:52.180
Don't say that.

38:52.180 --> 38:57.140
OK, Tinie Tempah,
you went around the track...

38:57.140 --> 38:59.620
in one minute...

38:59.620 --> 39:01.420
- 50...
- Oh!

39:01.420 --> 39:03.580
- Point four.
- Good effort.

39:03.580 --> 39:05.020
That's a good effort.

39:05.020 --> 39:06.780
Considerably wetter.

39:06.780 --> 39:09.020
Considerably...
Considerably wetter.

39:09.020 --> 39:12.100
..three seconds slower out
there for you. Yes, it was.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.420
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

39:14.420 --> 39:17.620
Yeah, that's solid.
That's solid for those conditions.

39:17.620 --> 39:19.700
Ladies and gentlemen, Tinie Tempah!

39:19.700 --> 39:21.900
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

39:30.980 --> 39:32.660
What a hero.

39:32.660 --> 39:35.460
OK, now, earlier on you
remember Chris was driving

39:35.460 --> 39:38.300
the 1,500 horsepower Bugatti Chiron.

39:38.300 --> 39:40.980
Which, so long as you have more
money than Mark Zuckerberg,

39:40.980 --> 39:44.300
- is pretty much as fast as you can go in a car.
- Yes, that's true.

39:44.300 --> 39:47.420
But, of course, if you have more
money than Mark Zuckerberg,

39:47.420 --> 39:49.860
you're not limited to just cars.

39:49.860 --> 39:52.820
So, since we had
a day to kill with the Chiron,

39:52.820 --> 39:54.780
we decided to have a little race.

39:59.780 --> 40:02.660
It's the age-old question
we've all pondered -

40:02.660 --> 40:06.020
you're a billionaire oil mogul
based in downtown Dubai,

40:06.020 --> 40:08.620
you knock off work at lunch
on a Friday,

40:08.620 --> 40:12.340
or a Thursday as they do here,
so what's the fastest way

40:12.340 --> 40:15.860
to reach your luxury weekend
retreat in the Omani mountains?

40:15.860 --> 40:18.260
Car or not car?

40:24.580 --> 40:28.780
- Hello.
- Well, I'm what they call suitably equipped, Matthew.
- Yeah.

40:28.780 --> 40:32.140
I can't help noticing
you have no transport.

40:32.140 --> 40:34.420
Are you planning
on walking to Oman?

40:34.420 --> 40:36.460
No, no, no. Don't worry.
Off you go.

40:36.460 --> 40:38.820
I'll be the guy at the hotel bar
with all the empty drinks

40:38.820 --> 40:40.580
- in front of him.
- No, you're going to lose.

40:40.580 --> 40:44.380
It's not possible to get anywhere
faster than in this car.

40:44.380 --> 40:47.100
Yeah, and what a car!

40:47.100 --> 40:48.580
HE WHISTLES

40:49.860 --> 40:51.700
Does come in men's?

40:51.700 --> 40:53.860
You're better than that,
you know you are.

40:53.860 --> 40:56.700
- And, also, what's in that rucksack? Why's it so big?
- This?

40:56.700 --> 40:59.260
My lunch.

40:59.260 --> 41:01.540
Three, two, one, go.

41:01.540 --> 41:04.020
- Oh, hang...
- You're going to lose.
- Wait, wait, wait!

41:04.020 --> 41:06.340
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

41:06.340 --> 41:09.260
- You're going to lose.
- I'm already in front of you!

41:16.220 --> 41:18.740
Now, the winner of this
billionaire's commute-off

41:18.740 --> 41:21.740
would be the first to get
from the heart of Dubai

41:21.740 --> 41:23.740
to a luxury five-star retreat,

41:23.740 --> 41:26.820
perched high in the mountains
of neighbouring Oman.

41:26.820 --> 41:29.300
And with Chris driving the Chiron,

41:29.300 --> 41:31.740
I would have
to travel by other means.

41:31.740 --> 41:33.420
No driving.

41:33.420 --> 41:34.900
I won't be driving.

41:34.900 --> 41:37.420
Not one bit of driving.

41:37.420 --> 41:38.940
I have a plan.

41:40.260 --> 41:43.940
I think I can safely say
I'm the only Chiron driving around

41:43.940 --> 41:48.060
on the public highway
in the world at the moment.

41:48.060 --> 41:50.380
One of us is currently winning...

41:50.380 --> 41:51.940
and it's not Joey!

41:53.020 --> 41:55.860
Anyone can take a car.

41:55.860 --> 41:58.660
A billionaire doesn't take a car.

42:03.060 --> 42:06.380
So you are actually
walking to Oman.

42:06.380 --> 42:10.100
- Very luxurious.
- You're wasting time you don't have, keep going.

42:14.980 --> 42:17.220
An angry small man in Dubai,

42:17.220 --> 42:19.860
rocks up in his Chiron,
says, "Hi," What a...

42:19.860 --> 42:21.860
BEEPING

42:21.860 --> 42:25.740
Unfortunately, I quickly encountered
a problem unfamiliar to most

42:25.740 --> 42:27.900
billionaires, rush hour.

42:27.900 --> 42:31.180
There's about 19 lanes and yet
everyone's stuck stationary.

42:31.180 --> 42:33.500
- BEEPING
- Oh, come on!

42:33.500 --> 42:37.340
Don't drive into me.
This is worth 2 million quid.

42:37.340 --> 42:39.900
'Silly Harris, you see,
traffic was not something

42:39.900 --> 42:41.220
'I needed to worry about.'

42:41.220 --> 42:44.100
That's right, it's a boat.

42:44.100 --> 42:49.140
'And this was just stage one
of my four stage master plan.'

42:49.140 --> 42:51.420
This is the
frustrating part of the race

42:51.420 --> 42:54.660
because we have to adhere
to this five-knot speed limit.

42:54.660 --> 42:58.220
Once we get out on the
open water, we can pin it.

42:58.220 --> 43:02.860
The Riva Rivarama is 44 feet long,
costs £1 million -

43:02.860 --> 43:06.900
half the price of Harris's car,
which is only a third the length

43:06.900 --> 43:11.540
of this boat, and he doesn't
even have an onboard ice-maker.

43:11.540 --> 43:12.580
Or a toilet.

43:14.340 --> 43:15.580
He's in trouble.

43:15.580 --> 43:17.740
Well, not quite...

43:17.740 --> 43:20.380
Because when you're
a billionaire for the day,

43:20.380 --> 43:22.700
you can call in the odd favour.

43:22.700 --> 43:24.620
SIRENS

43:24.620 --> 43:28.540
Yes, yes, yes!
Now, this is what I call a plan.

43:28.540 --> 43:31.980
I'm being escorted out of Dubai
at speed

43:31.980 --> 43:35.140
behind a Dubai police i8.

43:35.140 --> 43:37.700
There's a McLaren 570 ahead,

43:37.700 --> 43:42.100
behind me, a Nissan-GTR -
and to my left

43:42.100 --> 43:47.100
is an Audi R8 V10 Plus.
It has 610 horsepower.

43:47.100 --> 43:51.940
That's 900 less than
the one I'm in. 900 less!

43:53.220 --> 43:54.580
This is cool!

43:55.620 --> 43:59.020
'Whatever.
See, I was now clear of the marina.

44:00.780 --> 44:02.180
'Fast as you like.'

44:02.180 --> 44:05.060
Oh, yeah, baby!
That's the stuff right there.

44:05.060 --> 44:07.020
PHONE RINGS

44:09.860 --> 44:12.820
- Hello!
- Have you located some proper transport yet?

44:12.820 --> 44:14.860
I can't really hear you too good.

44:14.860 --> 44:17.300
It's a little windy
out here on the sea.

44:17.300 --> 44:19.940
- What are you on, a boat?
- Yeah.

44:19.940 --> 44:24.060
Just having a
good old time racing you.

44:24.060 --> 44:28.460
I've got through the Dubai traffic
by using a police escort

44:28.460 --> 44:31.180
and I'm now heading
towards the border.

44:31.180 --> 44:33.460
I can't possibly see how
you can win.

44:35.220 --> 44:39.980
Yes, an hour in and with Admiral
LeBlanc bobbing around in his boat,

44:39.980 --> 44:42.060
I was well on my way to Oman.

44:42.060 --> 44:45.580
Frankly, this wasn't
much of a race after all.

44:47.220 --> 44:51.180
Maybe I could just spend the next
hour conjugating the verb "to win."

44:51.180 --> 44:55.220
I win, you win,
he, she or it wins...

44:55.220 --> 44:58.180
we win, you win, they win...

44:59.500 --> 45:02.060
Or you're Matt LeBlanc,
and you lose.

45:03.140 --> 45:06.860
What has Matthew got planned?

45:06.860 --> 45:10.460
Well, since he asked, it was time
for the second stage of my commute.

45:10.460 --> 45:13.500
OK, here she is!

45:13.500 --> 45:18.140
Now, that is the
Bentley Mulsanne EWB.

45:18.140 --> 45:19.460
Extended wheelbase.

45:25.260 --> 45:28.860
Now, of course, I'm not driving.

45:28.860 --> 45:32.540
'No, no. Like any good billionaire,
I have a chauffeur -

45:32.540 --> 45:35.300
'The Stig's Emirati cousin.'

45:35.300 --> 45:37.300
OK, vamos!

45:37.300 --> 45:40.180
Andiamo!

45:40.180 --> 45:41.300
Allez?

45:42.580 --> 45:43.660
Go!

45:52.620 --> 45:55.220
Meanwhile, basking
in my comfortable lead,

45:55.220 --> 45:59.660
I had time to consider
some of the Chiron's utter madness.

45:59.660 --> 46:02.180
Remember when you were a kid
and you'd get into cars

46:02.180 --> 46:05.300
and always look how fast
the speedometer read to?

46:05.300 --> 46:08.580
And you'd assume that
if a speedometer said 140,

46:08.580 --> 46:10.140
the car could do 140?

46:10.140 --> 46:13.340
Ha-ha!
In the Chiron, the game is over.

46:13.340 --> 46:17.060
This reads
to 500 kilometres per hour.

46:17.060 --> 46:19.780
That's 300 miles an hour.

46:22.340 --> 46:26.100
How do you out-Chiron a Chiron?
What do you do?

46:28.500 --> 46:30.380
Come on.

46:30.380 --> 46:33.740
Now, I had hit some traffic,
but to be honest,

46:33.740 --> 46:36.180
in the Mulsanne,
it was hard to care.

46:37.260 --> 46:39.740
Oh... Oh, yeah.

46:41.620 --> 46:43.260
Yeah, it gives you a massage...

46:46.460 --> 46:52.300
Oh... That is maybe the nicest
car seat that was ever made.

46:58.780 --> 47:02.300
Let's give him a call,
see how old Chris is doing.

47:02.300 --> 47:03.540
Hello?

47:03.540 --> 47:05.580
Well, well, well, how are you?

47:05.580 --> 47:07.340
Pretend you're not going
to hear this...

47:07.340 --> 47:09.140
- Super, please.
- Super?
- Super.

47:09.140 --> 47:11.020
MATT LAUGHS

47:11.020 --> 47:14.300
How many fuel stops have you made so
far? Is this your second or third?

47:14.300 --> 47:16.580
It's my first, don't be stupid.

47:16.580 --> 47:17.700
'Where are you?'

47:17.700 --> 47:20.220
I, my friend,
am sitting in the back of

47:20.220 --> 47:23.820
a beautiful Bentley Mulsanne EWB.

47:23.820 --> 47:28.820
So, you've taken a boat
to get in the back of a Bentley

47:28.820 --> 47:31.100
that you know is slower
than my car, and now you're

47:31.100 --> 47:33.500
just going to drive
all the way to Oman?

47:33.500 --> 47:35.300
'I had you down as a clever man.'

47:35.300 --> 47:38.020
I didn't say anything about driving
all the way to Oman.

47:39.140 --> 47:40.340
OK.

47:40.340 --> 47:43.420
Oh, do you want some money?
Do you want money?

47:43.420 --> 47:45.300
'Yeah, you have to pay
for that fuel.'

47:45.300 --> 47:46.380
Hey, listen...

47:47.820 --> 47:50.060
- PHONE BEEPS
- Oh, he's gone.

47:50.060 --> 47:51.780
HE CHUCKLES

47:51.780 --> 47:53.300
A small, angry man in Dubai

47:53.300 --> 47:55.500
Rocks up in his Chiron,
says, "Hi..."

47:57.180 --> 48:00.540
With his mad little grin
Cos he thinks he'll win...

48:05.220 --> 48:06.300
BLEEP!

48:09.180 --> 48:12.700
OK, my plan to avoid all of Dubai's
traffic with the speedboat

48:12.700 --> 48:16.540
had backfired,
and after two hours of racing,

48:16.540 --> 48:18.700
I was still stuck downtown,

48:18.700 --> 48:22.700
while Chris was approaching Oman,
100 miles ahead of me.

48:23.980 --> 48:26.420
Ah. The border.

48:26.420 --> 48:32.620
Which looks strangely similar
to the Mound Stand at Lord's.

48:32.620 --> 48:35.180
What's going to happen here?
Don't we just go through?

48:36.940 --> 48:38.180
He's got a gun.

48:39.620 --> 48:42.100
He's got a gun as well, actually,
I didn't notice him.

48:42.100 --> 48:46.220
What's going on here?
Come on, let me through...

48:50.180 --> 48:52.340
Yes! I'm liking the look of this!

48:53.620 --> 48:55.420
You see...?

48:55.420 --> 48:59.260
The Bugatti Chiron improves
international relations -

48:59.260 --> 49:03.460
just smile and look as if you are
comfortable with what you're doing.

49:06.780 --> 49:11.260
What's he doing?
He wants me to wait here?

49:11.260 --> 49:13.820
Or what? Wait here?

49:13.820 --> 49:15.500
Good, OK, OK.

49:16.580 --> 49:19.060
MEN CHATTER

49:21.940 --> 49:23.100
So...

49:24.100 --> 49:27.100
They're all tweeting
and taking photos of the car.

49:27.100 --> 49:31.580
- Hashtag - can I please get on with it?
- How are you, sir?

49:31.580 --> 49:35.060
- Hello, how are you?
- Welcome back.
- Thank you. Hello.

49:35.060 --> 49:38.220
- Sir, I've got to change this number.
- What?

49:40.900 --> 49:44.660
So they're re-registering the car
cos we've entered Oman.

49:44.660 --> 49:47.780
This is a disaster,
I've been here 30 minutes now.

49:47.780 --> 49:50.580
Matt LeSmuggins is going to be...

49:51.700 --> 49:54.100
I don't know where he is.

49:54.100 --> 49:57.380
Well, I had finally reached
stage three of my plan...

49:57.380 --> 49:59.540
TYRES SCREECH

49:59.540 --> 50:00.740
Thanks, Stig!

50:00.740 --> 50:03.020
'..and really had
some catching up to do.'

50:03.020 --> 50:04.460
How are you?

50:04.460 --> 50:07.540
Nice to see you. Hello.

50:07.540 --> 50:12.500
OK. Did not plan on
that much traffic.

50:12.500 --> 50:15.540
Worse still, Chris had crossed
the border into Oman.

50:17.460 --> 50:20.580
'Luckily, stage three...
was a good one.'

50:20.580 --> 50:23.060
Ho-ho! There it is.

50:23.060 --> 50:27.940
The Honda Jet,
as in a jet made by Honda.

50:27.940 --> 50:30.260
Howdy, boys. Let's go!

50:33.740 --> 50:35.140
This thing's quick!

50:36.980 --> 50:38.740
Oh, that's a steep climb.

50:38.740 --> 50:40.460
Yeah, baby.

50:41.700 --> 50:43.580
That's what I'm talking about.

50:45.260 --> 50:46.620
Hey, how fast are we going?

50:46.620 --> 50:51.020
- About 480mph.
- Maxed out, boom!

50:53.020 --> 50:54.820
It's like we're rolling up here.

50:56.220 --> 50:59.100
You know, somewhere down there
there's a very small man

50:59.100 --> 51:02.380
in a very fast car,
and though that very small man

51:02.380 --> 51:04.260
is still talking a very big game...

51:05.260 --> 51:08.180
..deep down, deep, deep down,

51:08.180 --> 51:11.860
that very small man knows very well
that he is going to lose.

51:13.180 --> 51:15.700
It's very sad.

51:15.700 --> 51:22.020
That border check situation...
That lost me a lot of time.

51:22.020 --> 51:27.580
Come on, Mr Bugatti... We might just
have to deploy a bit of your speed.

51:27.580 --> 51:31.540
Meanwhile... at 15,000 feet...

51:31.540 --> 51:37.700
The Honda Jet, £3.6 million,
20 years in the making.

51:37.700 --> 51:41.180
Its ground-breaking
overwing engine design

51:41.180 --> 51:43.860
maximises performance
and efficiency.

51:43.860 --> 51:46.020
It comes with snacks too.

51:46.020 --> 51:50.980
But what it all really adds up to
is a great way to overtake a Chiron.

51:53.220 --> 51:54.860
You're what...? You're in a Honda?

51:56.260 --> 51:58.180
No, it's not a Civic.

51:59.340 --> 52:01.260
No, it's not an Accord.

52:01.260 --> 52:04.020
It's not the NSX either.

52:04.020 --> 52:05.260
It's the Honda Jet.

52:07.460 --> 52:10.580
Git! Utter git!

52:12.660 --> 52:14.260
I can't even boast that I've got

52:14.260 --> 52:16.900
the fastest, most expensive
toy now, can I?

52:18.620 --> 52:22.060
'The Honda had definitely
put me back in the game.'

52:22.060 --> 52:24.220
Making time, making time...

52:24.220 --> 52:28.220
'But my one-hour flight would
touch me down in Muscat,

52:28.220 --> 52:30.460
'which was still a good 100 miles

52:30.460 --> 52:32.980
'from the mountaintop finish line.

52:32.980 --> 52:36.820
'So, Chris was technically
still in the lead...'

52:36.820 --> 52:38.820
Speed's dropping again.

52:38.820 --> 52:40.140
'..for now.'

52:41.740 --> 52:43.980
We're coming into another town...

52:43.980 --> 52:46.260
It's becoming a pain, this.

52:48.780 --> 52:51.420
You know when your brain tells you
you just have to keep moving

52:51.420 --> 52:54.260
when the traffic stops, so you
dive off and take another route

52:54.260 --> 52:56.700
and think that keeping moving
is the thing...?

52:56.700 --> 52:58.460
But it turns out to be rubbish?

52:58.460 --> 53:00.100
Yeah, that's where I am now.

53:02.580 --> 53:03.780
Matt's going to be quivering

53:03.780 --> 53:05.980
when he finds out how fast
I'm driving through here.

53:07.260 --> 53:09.380
HE WHEEZES

53:10.460 --> 53:12.300
This is ridiculous.

53:12.300 --> 53:14.900
- SENSOR BLEEPS
- No, no, no, no, no...

53:14.900 --> 53:17.180
This thing is two metres wide!

53:18.460 --> 53:20.460
YELLS: - I hate this!

53:21.700 --> 53:25.340
A-a-a-a-nd... touchdown.

53:25.340 --> 53:27.020
Thanks a lot, take care.

53:27.020 --> 53:30.500
'Stage four, it was time to open up
the backpack.'

53:30.500 --> 53:32.500
Excuse me one second,
I'll be right back.

53:32.500 --> 53:34.620
I've got to take care of something.

53:38.780 --> 53:41.020
So, the rules said no driving...

53:41.020 --> 53:43.060
HE CHUCKLES MISCHIEVOUSLY

53:43.060 --> 53:45.300
Nobody said anything about riding.

53:47.460 --> 53:52.500
This is the new
Ducati 1299 Superleggera.

53:54.260 --> 53:58.980
Hey, Chris, I don't know where
you are or what you're doing,

53:58.980 --> 54:01.620
but I'm pretty confident
I'm going to win.

54:01.620 --> 54:03.500
Now, I know what you're thinking,
and, no,

54:03.500 --> 54:04.820
your average billionaire

54:04.820 --> 54:07.340
probably wouldn't finish
their commute on a bike,

54:07.340 --> 54:11.700
but that's probably because
they haven't tried THIS bike.

54:15.220 --> 54:19.740
The Superleggera will do 0-60
in about two and a half seconds,

54:19.740 --> 54:22.420
which is the same as the Chiron.

54:22.420 --> 54:26.100
The only difference is I don't need
1,500 horsepower to do it,

54:26.100 --> 54:27.580
just a bit of bravery.

54:29.140 --> 54:32.940
The top speed is
190-something miles an hour.

54:32.940 --> 54:35.580
Now, some people will look at that
and say,

54:35.580 --> 54:37.540
"Well, that's just stupid,

54:37.540 --> 54:40.420
"that's more speed than anyone
would ever need."

54:40.420 --> 54:42.660
To which I say, "Exactly."

54:46.580 --> 54:51.700
The small, angry man in Dubai
Rocked up in his Chiron, said, "Hi"

54:51.700 --> 54:55.980
With a mad little grin
He thought he could win

54:55.980 --> 54:58.340
But at the bar in the mountains
he'll cry.

54:58.340 --> 55:00.660
That's it, that's the rhyme.

55:01.900 --> 55:04.900
But as I made short work of
my 100-mile ride from Muscat,

55:04.900 --> 55:07.660
Chris had found his way
back onto the open road.

55:07.660 --> 55:09.180
Are you off the plane?

55:09.180 --> 55:12.020
- Yeah, I'm on a bike.
- What do you mean, you're on a bike?

55:12.020 --> 55:13.180
What bike?

55:13.180 --> 55:16.020
Ducati 1299 Superleggera.

55:16.020 --> 55:19.580
- You what?!
- Yeah, you better stand on it, buddy.

55:19.580 --> 55:24.980
That bike is basically
a personal teleportation device.

55:24.980 --> 55:27.500
Thankfully, so is the Chiron.

55:29.500 --> 55:30.820
Let's get a move on.

55:33.260 --> 55:36.060
Now we're talking.
A little bit of open road here.

55:39.100 --> 55:41.140
Come on, push, push!

55:42.980 --> 55:45.220
Come on! Come on! Come on!

55:47.380 --> 55:49.380
Foot down.

55:49.380 --> 55:50.940
- This thing's - BLEEP - fast!

55:50.940 --> 55:53.300
Approaching the mountains
from opposite sides,

55:53.300 --> 55:55.540
we were entering the final stage
of the race.

55:55.540 --> 55:57.500
With no way of telling
who was in front,

55:57.500 --> 56:00.180
there was just one road up
to the finish line...

56:01.220 --> 56:02.620
Oh, look at that.

56:02.620 --> 56:05.380
..and it was a good one.

56:05.380 --> 56:06.900
This is about to get fun.

56:11.140 --> 56:12.380
Wow!

56:14.180 --> 56:16.220
Now this is a proper road!

56:17.220 --> 56:19.740
Look at it, fantastic!

56:22.540 --> 56:24.020
Now we're talking.

56:25.820 --> 56:27.420
This is nice!

56:29.060 --> 56:36.100
God, it goes left to right so good.
It just holds the line perfect.

56:38.660 --> 56:41.020
And I know this is a car show...

56:41.020 --> 56:43.660
so you probably want the Chiron
to win, but if it doesn't...

56:43.660 --> 56:45.460
I mean, when...
When it doesn't...

56:46.460 --> 56:48.740
..don't blame the car...
blame Harris.

56:50.580 --> 56:53.180
I don't know if I'm hunting him down
and catching him

56:53.180 --> 56:54.860
or maybe he's catching me.

56:57.620 --> 57:01.580
I don't see that big gold Bugatti
in my mirror.

57:01.580 --> 57:04.780
Got to be in front. He's got to be.

57:04.780 --> 57:08.980
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Please let me be ahead of him!

57:08.980 --> 57:12.260
Please let me be ahead of him!

57:12.260 --> 57:13.500
Come on, push, push!

57:13.500 --> 57:15.500
Push, LeBlanc!

57:17.420 --> 57:21.380
Come on, Mr Chiron!
We have to win this!

57:23.340 --> 57:25.140
This is it, this is it.

57:31.580 --> 57:32.780
OK, thanks, buddy.

57:35.540 --> 57:37.700
Where is he?

57:37.700 --> 57:39.420
That's it, that's the spot.

57:41.780 --> 57:45.220
He's small, but he's not that small,
I don't see him.

57:46.940 --> 57:48.460
I think we have a winner!

57:50.620 --> 57:54.460
Oh, yes, that's what I'm
talking about, look at that view!

57:56.500 --> 57:58.700
Harris is going to be so mad.

57:58.700 --> 58:01.300
I can't wait to see the look
on his little...

58:02.620 --> 58:04.460
..bald face.

58:08.260 --> 58:12.220
There you go...
Have a Chiron. And no-one there.

58:12.220 --> 58:15.660
I think we've got this, boys.
I think we've got...

58:15.660 --> 58:17.180
Oh, come on, no.

58:17.180 --> 58:20.340
Welcome to Oman!
HE LAUGHS

58:20.340 --> 58:22.540
- No!
- How are you, my friend?

58:22.540 --> 58:25.180
Why so slow... bro?

58:25.180 --> 58:27.540
I haven't even thought of my line!

58:27.540 --> 58:29.420
- MATT CHUCKLES
- Oh...

58:29.420 --> 58:31.060
What was your line?

58:31.060 --> 58:33.380
It's like you're always stuck
in second gear,

58:33.380 --> 58:35.860
which looking at it now
wasn't very funny, was it?

58:35.860 --> 58:40.420
- I was stuck in top gear, my friend.
- Yes, well done. Well done.

58:40.420 --> 58:44.260
- MATT LAUGHS
- Oh!
- Oh, yeah.

58:44.260 --> 58:46.380
I can't believe I lost.

58:46.380 --> 58:47.940
You didn't lose.

58:47.940 --> 58:50.820
If you say I just came second,
I'll throw you off that balcony.

58:50.820 --> 58:52.140
- No, no, no.
- OK.

58:52.140 --> 58:55.940
No, you lost.
CHRIS LAUGHS

58:55.940 --> 58:58.740
No! Just get me off of here!

58:58.740 --> 58:59.860
Cheers.

59:01.300 --> 59:03.140
That's a good beer.

59:03.140 --> 59:05.580
It never tastes as good as
a winning beer, though, does it?

59:05.580 --> 59:07.700
- You want to try that one?
- Yeah.

59:07.700 --> 59:08.940
Thank you.

59:10.380 --> 59:12.340
Oh, yeah, that's better.

59:12.340 --> 59:15.300
MATT SPITS
Oh!

59:18.700 --> 59:22.620
You just missed the sunset,
it was beautiful.

59:22.620 --> 59:24.860
We could have held hands
and everything.

59:24.860 --> 59:27.220
CHRIS LAUGHS

59:30.460 --> 59:33.500
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

59:38.260 --> 59:41.100
So close. So, so close.

59:41.100 --> 59:42.300
That was so close.

59:42.300 --> 59:44.700
You know, I think if it wasn't
for that border crossing,

59:44.700 --> 59:45.900
you would have had me.

59:45.900 --> 59:48.980
Well, the border crossing and
the fact that I had my own jet.

59:48.980 --> 59:54.540
- Look, I'm gutted, but I made the Chiron look good value.
- What?!

59:54.540 --> 59:57.140
Well, add up the cost of the boat,

59:57.140 --> 01:00:00.580
the limo and then the plane
and the bike... How much is that?

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.500
- About £5 million.
- OK.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.900
Double the price of the Chiron and
I only lost by a couple of minutes.

01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:08.860
- You still lost.
- Mm.
- Or, or...

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:12.700
I maximised my time in the most
extraordinary car of the millennium.

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:15.140
Ah! No, you lost.

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.220
On next week's show,

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:20.460
a motorsport battle
as we find out who's quickest...

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:22.420
Chris Harris or Sabine Schmitz?
