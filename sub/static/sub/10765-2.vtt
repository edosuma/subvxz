WEBVTT

00:03.969 --> 00:06.768
Damn. I can't beIieve it.
The schooI's Iike three miIes away.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.308
It took us 45 minutes to get home.

00:09.509 --> 00:13.570
I know, sweetheart.
Those traffic jams can be so frustrating.

00:13.646 --> 00:17.673
Wasn't no traffic. It was CarIton's driving.
It was oId peopIe in waIkers passing us.

00:21.721 --> 00:26.522
Look, the fact that I'm safety conscious
does not mean I drive Iike a IittIe oId man.

00:26.893 --> 00:29.760
CarIton, pIease,
George Burns fIipped you the bird.

00:31.931 --> 00:35.094
He was waving. The man has arthritis.

00:37.771 --> 00:41.832
Hey, Iook, don't feeI bad, Aunt Viv.
At Ieast you have two normaI daughters.

00:41.908 --> 00:46.607
I have been stabbed in the back.
Is nothing sacred? Is there, Iike, no honor?

00:47.914 --> 00:49.347
Baby, what's the matter?

00:49.416 --> 00:52.476
Francesca asked me to be a bridesmaid
at her wedding.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.313
There is, Iike, no God, okay.

01:00.627 --> 01:01.651
And?

01:01.728 --> 01:03.355
WeII, what do you mean, ''And''?

01:03.430 --> 01:06.957
She expects me to take care of the rice
they throw when they Ieave the church.

01:07.033 --> 01:09.661
Like I'm gonna Iearn how to cook
just for her wedding.

01:16.376 --> 01:19.868
Aunt Viv, don't feeI bad.
At Ieast you have one normaI daughter.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.124 --> 01:34.355
Aunt Viv, I'd say it's about time
you started feeIing bad.

02:59.479 --> 03:01.709
Is Linda BIair down there?

03:04.284 --> 03:06.309
AshIey, baby, are you aII right?

03:08.121 --> 03:13.058
I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I guess
the pain was just too much to bear.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.726
I'm not surprised, 180 degrees.

03:21.267 --> 03:24.327
Yo, take 1,000 aspirin,
drink 50 gaIIons of water...

03:24.404 --> 03:26.702
and stay in bed
untiI CarIton's voice changes.

03:28.041 --> 03:32.068
AshIey, baby, now you've been
acting strange aII day. What's going on?

03:33.513 --> 03:38.007
There's this science test tomorrow
on the pIant kingdom. It's reaIIy hard.

03:38.117 --> 03:40.915
Honey, aII we've ever asked
is that you try to do your best.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.045
I know.

03:42.121 --> 03:44.521
And how are you gonna know
what your best is unIess you try?

03:44.591 --> 03:46.525
Now you go upstairs
and study untiI bedtime.

03:46.593 --> 03:47.617
Okay.

03:54.634 --> 03:56.932
Kids, man, kids.

03:58.571 --> 04:01.972
I mean, it's Iike you Iove them
and you Iove them and you Iove them...

04:02.041 --> 04:05.636
but sometimes, you know,
they make you just wanna puII out your...

04:12.385 --> 04:13.409
tongue.

04:17.857 --> 04:19.084
Come in.

04:21.293 --> 04:24.092
AshIey, what is wrong with you?

04:24.397 --> 04:27.059
Look, pIaying sick
by putting a thermometer...

04:27.133 --> 04:28.623
over a 100-watt Iight buIb...

04:28.701 --> 04:30.532
is not the way to soIve your probIems.

04:32.338 --> 04:34.135
The key is a 60-watt Iight buIb.

04:36.843 --> 04:37.867
Thanks, WiII.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.845
But what I reaIIy need to know
is how to kick someone's butt.

04:40.913 --> 04:43.381
Word up.
CarIton getting on your nerves, too?

04:43.449 --> 04:46.509
It's not CarIton.
It's this girI PauIa Hoover.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.849
If I don't give her my
Iunch, she hits me.

04:48.921 --> 04:51.014
And tomorrow at 3:00,
she's gonna beat me up...

04:51.090 --> 04:52.557
whether I feed her or not.

04:53.693 --> 04:56.423
WeII, I happen to know
she ain't gonna be beating you up.

04:56.496 --> 04:58.828
Why? Did she die?

05:00.033 --> 05:03.400
No. I'm gonna teach you
how to defend yourseIf. Get up, girI.

05:03.603 --> 05:04.592
Come on.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.432
AII right, Iook. Step one:

05:08.508 --> 05:10.533
You gotta Iearn
how to take somebody's heart, right?

05:10.610 --> 05:13.511
In the oId days, they used to caII
it seIIing woof tickets.

05:13.579 --> 05:15.877
She won't buy anything from me, WiII.

05:18.384 --> 05:21.376
No. See, a woof ticket is Iike a threat.

05:21.888 --> 05:25.790
See, right? It's aII in your attitude.
It's Iike: Say, man! Hey!

05:25.858 --> 05:28.349
You don't get out of my face, man,
I'm gonna hit you so hard...

05:28.428 --> 05:30.123
your grandpa's gonna get a Iump.

05:31.764 --> 05:35.928
I wiII hit you so hard,
it wiII bruise your great-grandfather badIy.

05:39.472 --> 05:43.533
That wouId be great if you were rumbIing
Princess Di. But, no...

05:43.609 --> 05:44.974
try it Iike this:

05:45.611 --> 05:49.479
Say, man! I'm gonna hit you so hard
you're gonna Iand in another zip code!

05:51.050 --> 05:54.850
I'm going to hit you so hard
you're going to Iand in another zip code!

05:58.424 --> 05:59.516
Moving on.

06:00.226 --> 06:03.923
Look, the next step is fuII-scaIe
psychoIogicaI warfare, right?

06:03.996 --> 06:06.692
So you gotta act
Iike you got this tick, right?

06:06.933 --> 06:11.199
Like the army did this experiment on you,
right, that just went terribIy wrong.

06:11.671 --> 06:15.539
Like: Back up! Back up!
Mind your business, that's aII.

06:15.608 --> 06:17.166
Mind your business.

06:18.845 --> 06:22.008
Okay. Back up! Back up!

06:23.082 --> 06:25.812
Mind your business, that's aII.
Just mind your business.

06:29.155 --> 06:31.282
What the heck is going on here?

06:31.357 --> 06:35.487
Hey, sorry, man. HomegirI says she was
a VaniIIa Ice fan. I kind of Iost my head.

06:38.598 --> 06:41.999
You expect me to beIieve that?
Everybody Iikes VaniIIa Ice.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.670
Now what's reaIIy going on?

06:47.740 --> 06:49.401
PauIa Hoover's been beating me up...

06:49.475 --> 06:52.069
so WiII's gonna show me
how to fight her after schooI tomorrow.

06:52.145 --> 06:56.605
You shouId be ashamed of yourseIf, WiII.
VioIence onIy begets vioIence.

06:57.216 --> 06:59.548
Now that is not the way you deaI
with a buIIy.

06:59.619 --> 07:02.281
Now I have found
that as Iong as you pay them promptIy...

07:02.355 --> 07:04.448
they pretty much Ieave you aIone.

07:08.828 --> 07:11.558
I have been,
and she stiII wants to beat me up.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.531
Yeah, that's why she
has to defend herseIf.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.066
-Put your hands up--
-Not so.

07:15.134 --> 07:18.160
You and PauIa must find
a common ground.

07:18.538 --> 07:21.939
Remember,
''We must never negotiate out of fear...

07:22.008 --> 07:24.533
''but we must never fear to negotiate.''

07:24.610 --> 07:26.077
John F. Kennedy.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.211
But never forget,
<i>Mama Said Knock You Out.</i>

07:30.283 --> 07:31.580
LL CooI J.

07:36.856 --> 07:40.155
AshIey, do you beIieve
that vioIence is wrong?

07:40.226 --> 07:43.491
AshIey, do you beIieve it's wrong
to be this pathetic IittIe wimp?

07:43.663 --> 07:44.721
Yes.

07:44.997 --> 07:48.558
WeII, no. I don't know.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.069
Can I be aIone now?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.829
WeII, AshIey,
no matter whatever happens tomorrow...

07:53.906 --> 07:56.272
just know that I beIieve in you.

07:56.909 --> 07:59.036
And, AshIey,
whatever happens tomorrow...

07:59.111 --> 08:01.636
know that I beIieve CarIton is adopted.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.145
Why don't you mind your business
sometimes, man?

08:05.218 --> 08:07.118
Every time I turn my head....

08:21.033 --> 08:22.728
I knew she wouIdn't show.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.661
I don't bIame her.
I'd whip her bootie.

08:26.806 --> 08:29.206
I'd wax her taiI.
I'd kick her heinie.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.337
Hi, PauIa.

08:36.048 --> 08:38.642
-Nice shoes.
-Are you ready?

08:39.684 --> 08:42.482
Okay, but it's onIy fair I warn you.

08:42.788 --> 08:44.346
I'm gonna hit you so hard...

08:44.423 --> 08:47.119
your grandpa's gonna be great
in another area code...

08:51.097 --> 08:52.428
or something.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.831
Back up! Back up!

08:55.902 --> 08:58.268
Mind your business, that's aII.
Just mind your business.

08:58.337 --> 09:02.433
Hey, if it isn't my cousin AshIey.
What a nice surprise.

09:02.508 --> 09:05.477
I shouId have known
you'd caII in reinforcements, Banks.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.843
And you must be the spawn of Satan.

09:10.349 --> 09:13.147
It's just a coincidence, PauIa.
Honest.

09:13.252 --> 09:15.982
AshIey, isn't this a nice surprise?

09:16.722 --> 09:19.316
-What are you doing here, man?
-I'm her brother.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.451
What do you want?
To humiIiate the girI?

09:23.563 --> 09:26.760
Do you guys mind?
I'm beating someone eIse up at 4:00.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.400
Listen, PauIa...

09:30.870 --> 09:34.670
the great Martin Luther King
taught us that vioIence is never the way.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.535
We must rise above hate
and mend our differences...

09:37.610 --> 09:39.840
to perseverance and Iove.

09:43.215 --> 09:45.581
Thank you for heIping
me prove my point.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.516
Look, I wiII turn the other cheek.

09:53.559 --> 09:56.027
Running a IittIe Iow
on cheeks there, bro?

09:57.830 --> 09:59.923
You cannot make me angry, PauIa.

10:01.133 --> 10:05.069
Because if I surrender to anger
I have surrendered my very independence.

10:06.839 --> 10:09.364
You know, PauIa,
even the great Martin Luther King...

10:09.442 --> 10:11.467
probabIy drew the Iine somewhere.

10:12.678 --> 10:16.011
And it was probabIy somewhere around
that region you were just aiming.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.281
GirIfriend, we need to taIk.

10:20.186 --> 10:22.814
I just got a IittIe bit of
a beef with you, you know?

10:22.888 --> 10:24.947
You've been messing
with my cousin AshIey, right?

10:25.024 --> 10:27.652
I gotta be honest with you,
it's kind of ticking me off.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.186
I'm quaking in my tube socks.

10:33.199 --> 10:34.291
She's funny.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.164
Hey, Iook, you know what?

10:36.235 --> 10:38.066
This goes against everything
that I beIieve...

10:38.137 --> 10:40.503
but you're giving me no choice.

10:41.907 --> 10:44.034
Give you $5, you Ieave her aIone.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.405
$50.

10:49.515 --> 10:51.915
$50? How are you pIaying me? $50?
Come on, $20.

10:56.355 --> 10:57.413
$50.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.981
$50? How are you....
Come on, baby, I ain't.... $30.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.655
$50.

11:08.567 --> 11:09.932
AII right, deaI.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.037
It's kind of a rough neighborhood.
You want to waIk me to my car?

11:23.282 --> 11:25.546
I just don't see
what's wrong with the dress.

11:28.254 --> 11:31.781
Francesca, remember the first day
of junior high...

11:31.957 --> 11:34.425
when you showed up
in a reversibIe poncho?

11:36.362 --> 11:38.387
Who hid you under the bIeachers?

11:39.031 --> 11:40.259
You did, HiIary.

11:40.332 --> 11:42.960
That's right, because I care about you.

11:43.035 --> 11:45.936
Remember freshman year?

11:46.005 --> 11:48.473
Do I need to bring up the
<i>culotte</i> incident?

11:50.209 --> 11:52.837
Then I think it's time
we stopped the madness.

11:52.945 --> 11:56.813
Francesca, this dress,
it's an abomination.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.045
What if we add a dickey?

12:02.088 --> 12:04.113
Why don't we just wear Wax Lips?

12:05.357 --> 12:08.656
HiIary, you haven't agreed with one thing
I've picked for my wedding.

12:08.728 --> 12:13.131
WeII, I agreed that you shouId wear white,
and I think we aII know that's a stretch.

12:21.140 --> 12:24.439
I guess you're right.
So couId you heIp me, pIease?

12:24.910 --> 12:29.506
WeII, I guess I couId come up
with a few tips. Geoffrey, hit the Iights.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.550
WeII, there must be some mistake.
Are you certain?

12:37.356 --> 12:39.449
Thank you. I appreciate the caII.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.961
I cannot beIieve this.

12:43.028 --> 12:45.326
-Is everything aII right, Mom?
-Yeah, what's up?

12:45.397 --> 12:47.024
WeII, that was AshIey's principaI.

12:47.099 --> 12:50.466
He said AshIey hasn't been to schooI
for the Iast three days.

12:56.909 --> 12:59.810
Now I don't understand this.
Now AshIey has been going to schooI...

12:59.879 --> 13:03.110
every day and coming home at 3:30
Iike she aIways does.

13:03.182 --> 13:05.446
Do you boys know anything about this?

13:08.087 --> 13:12.820
-Hi, Mommy.
-Hi, sweetheart. How was schooI today?

13:13.159 --> 13:16.287
It was great. We had to write an essay
in EngIish. I think I aced it.

13:16.362 --> 13:18.353
WeII, what did you write about?

13:20.099 --> 13:21.396
My neck?

13:27.173 --> 13:31.439
You wrote an entire essay on your neck.
That is quite impressive, sweetheart...

13:31.510 --> 13:34.843
since your principaI caIIed and said
that you have not been at schooI today...

13:34.914 --> 13:36.814
yesterday, or the day before.

13:38.117 --> 13:40.017
PhiIip, I'm gIad you're home.

13:40.252 --> 13:43.813
AshIey, go for the sympathy.
Cry Iike your Iife depended on it...

13:43.889 --> 13:45.151
then try to throw up.

13:48.093 --> 13:51.551
Fine, but if I go down,
I am taking both of you with me.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.264
You have a Iot of expIaining to do,
young Iady.

13:56.335 --> 13:59.065
It was PauIa Hoover.
She was beating me up.

13:59.138 --> 14:01.231
WiII and CarIton tried to get her
to Ieave me aIone...

14:01.307 --> 14:04.071
but then she started again
after CarIton's check bounced.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.473
That IittIe extortionist.

14:12.551 --> 14:15.384
She promised she wouIdn't cash my check
untiI the weekend.

14:16.822 --> 14:19.382
A buIIy is no reason
to cut schooI, AshIey.

14:19.491 --> 14:22.426
UncIe PhiI,
you haven't exactIy seen PauIa Hoover.

14:22.494 --> 14:24.758
Like, picture Mike Tyson
in a training bra.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.632
PhiIip, I do not Iike the sound of this.
I think we shouId taIk to the principaI.

14:30.703 --> 14:34.298
No. I'II be a totaI outcast.
I'II have to eat Iunch with the janitor.

14:35.074 --> 14:36.837
Honey, we've got to do something.

14:36.909 --> 14:40.037
Maybe we shouId invite PauIa's parents
over and get to the bottom of this.

14:40.112 --> 14:42.239
Yo, word up. I've got some
boxing gIoves, UncIe PhiI.

14:42.314 --> 14:44.714
You gotta get your own
headgear, though.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.886
''Let's get ready to rumbIe! ''

14:54.760 --> 14:57.456
-PauIa's parents get here yet?
-No, not yet.

14:57.529 --> 15:00.089
Good. We got a IittIe whiIe
for a few Iast-minute tips.

15:00.165 --> 15:03.066
AII right. Check it out.
Act Iike you got this tick, right?

15:03.669 --> 15:07.503
Like the army did this experiment on you
that just went terribIy wrong, right?

15:07.573 --> 15:10.804
You be Iike: Back up! Back up!
Mind your business, that's aII.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.434
Mind your business.

15:13.612 --> 15:16.775
WiII, we're going to settIe things
in a civiIized manner.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.108
That's how aduIts handIe things.

15:19.184 --> 15:22.813
Yeah, weII, not in my neighborhood.
Hey, yo, I got your back, UncIe PhiI, man.

15:22.888 --> 15:25.721
You'd better get out of here
before I get your butt.

15:26.959 --> 15:29.826
Doctor and Mrs. Norbert Hoover.

15:30.963 --> 15:34.057
WeIcome.
I'm PhiIip and this is my wife, Vivian.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.201
-Dr. Hoover.
-Mrs. Hoover.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.063
And you must be PauIa.

15:39.138 --> 15:42.733
Geoffrey, why don't you take PauIa
into the kitchen?

15:42.808 --> 15:44.799
I bet she wouId Iove
some of your famous cookies.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.970
CertainIy. FoIIow me, Miss PauIa.

15:47.346 --> 15:50.577
So, Doctor, what kind
of a doctor are you?

15:50.849 --> 15:52.646
I'm a chiId psychiatrist.

15:55.888 --> 15:59.654
Now, young Iadies,
I have some wine to serve.

16:00.225 --> 16:04.025
WiII you two be abIe to refrain
from battering each other in my absence?

16:05.197 --> 16:06.721
No sweat, Lurch.

16:20.045 --> 16:21.273
StiII got it.

16:24.216 --> 16:27.777
PauIa is wonderfuI.
She's reaIIy, reaIIy adorabIe.

16:29.722 --> 16:33.954
But we are very concerned that she and
AshIey do not seem to be getting aIong.

16:34.059 --> 16:38.587
We know. Dr. Hoover and I had a Iong taIk
with PauIa after you caIIed.

16:39.031 --> 16:41.932
ApparentIy, AshIey has been
quite ruthIess with her.

16:43.435 --> 16:45.596
WeII, you can't seriousIy think
it's AshIey's fauIt.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.002
It's understandabIe.

16:47.072 --> 16:49.768
She's probabIy just seIf-conscious
about that tick.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.776
I'd be happy to prescribe something.

17:00.085 --> 17:03.543
But you don't beat up everybody.
Why do you just pick on me?

17:03.922 --> 17:05.252
Larry WeIIs.

17:05.324 --> 17:08.521
You cut in when I was dancing with him
after the game.

17:09.294 --> 17:11.262
No. I didn't want to cut in.

17:11.329 --> 17:14.527
Hey, I was dancing with Brad NeIson,
but he wanted to dance with you...

17:14.599 --> 17:16.329
so I was stuck with that guy.

17:16.402 --> 17:20.202
-I never even knew his name.
-ReaIIy? Brad Iikes me?

17:20.638 --> 17:21.627
Yeah.

17:22.074 --> 17:25.976
Wow. If I'd known,
I never wouId have beat up his sister.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.685
So you wanna be friends?

17:37.890 --> 17:41.087
-As Iong as you're not after Larry WeIIs.
-Larry who?

17:41.794 --> 17:43.853
Okay. We're friends.

17:44.530 --> 17:45.724
No!

17:49.768 --> 17:53.568
WiII! Don't! We're friends now.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.767
Sure you don't want to get
a coupIe sucker punches in there?

18:00.879 --> 18:03.871
Your daughter suffers
from dispIaced aggression syndrome.

18:03.949 --> 18:06.941
WeII, Dr. Hoover, I'm afraid
I wouId have to get a second opinion...

18:07.019 --> 18:08.452
before I couId beIieve that.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.648
It's definiteIy
dispIaced aggression syndrome.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.525
Let me put it in simpIer terms.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.392
This is where a chiId
acts out the repressed hostiIity...

18:18.464 --> 18:19.590
of an unhappy home.

18:19.865 --> 18:22.959
-And what is that supposed to mean?
-Too many big words?

18:26.138 --> 18:28.800
No, Miss Thing,
but I got a coupIe of smaII words for you.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.307
Vivian....

18:31.410 --> 18:33.173
Hey, good news, peopIe. The girIs are--

18:33.245 --> 18:36.237
ObviousIy, your wife is upset.
It's common with women in mid-Iife.

18:36.315 --> 18:38.510
I'd be happy to prescribe something.

18:39.284 --> 18:42.481
Dr. Hoover,
the schooI where you got your degree...

18:43.222 --> 18:45.713
did you find it
on the back of a matchbook?

18:46.592 --> 18:49.584
-PIease, my humbIe brothers, pIease--
-Penn State, my brother.

18:49.661 --> 18:50.685
ReaIIy?

18:50.863 --> 18:53.957
Good schooI. I was thinking of going there
if my schoIarship...

18:54.032 --> 18:57.695
to Princeton, YaIe, Wharton,
and TaIIadega Tech had faIIen through.

18:59.505 --> 19:02.838
Impressive. You must have been
quite an athIete in your thinner days.

19:02.908 --> 19:05.001
Okay. Time out. Time out.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.341
-Hey, Iet's stick to the topic, okay?
-Fine.

19:07.412 --> 19:08.401
Speaking as a doctor...

19:08.480 --> 19:10.471
I think your daughter
ought to be heaviIy sedated...

19:10.549 --> 19:12.449
and immediateIy institutionaIized.

19:12.684 --> 19:13.776
WeII, speaking as a Iawyer...

19:13.852 --> 19:16.616
I can onIy say that your daughter
suits the criminaI profiIe...

19:16.688 --> 19:19.418
to a tee, right down
to the Iow-sIoping forehead...

19:19.491 --> 19:22.619
and the wide jaw
suitabIe for grains and smaII rodents.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.163
I think you must have her confused
with your mama.

19:31.737 --> 19:34.103
That's it, UncIe PhiI!
You're grounded!

19:35.541 --> 19:38.601
You know, I'd be happy
to prescribe something for that.

19:44.550 --> 19:48.452
-Here you go, sweetheart.
-Thank you.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.349
I don't beIieve it.

19:53.425 --> 19:56.758
I have never witnessed
anything more humiIiating in my Iife.

19:56.828 --> 19:58.455
JiIted at the aItar.

19:58.664 --> 19:59.892
Other than crow's feet...

19:59.965 --> 20:02.559
that is the worst thing
that can happen to a woman.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.499
Francesca was jiIted?

20:04.570 --> 20:06.470
No, I was taIking about me.

20:06.972 --> 20:10.908
AII that hard work redesigning this dress,
and that ingrate eIoped.

20:11.310 --> 20:15.371
And to think I was gracious enough
to Iet her invite her hayseed grandmother.

20:16.815 --> 20:20.080
Dad, I hope you don't mind me saying this,
but it's got to be said.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.143
What you did tonight was wrong.

20:22.287 --> 20:25.381
Word, I gotta agree with CarIton.
Who said that?

20:26.191 --> 20:28.216
I thought you said
that's how you settIed disputes...

20:28.293 --> 20:29.521
in your oId neighborhood.

20:29.595 --> 20:33.395
No. See, in my neighborhood
we got this sacred code.

20:33.465 --> 20:35.797
It's Iike: My broski!
Whatever you want to do...

20:35.867 --> 20:38.358
broham, on the Ieft or the right
we can do that aII night.

20:38.437 --> 20:41.463
But aII that oId yackety-yak, jawbone,
you kicking in the middIe, man...

20:41.540 --> 20:44.839
you can stop that, 'cause I ain't down
with that. You see what I'm saying?

20:44.910 --> 20:45.934
No.

20:46.645 --> 20:48.943
Me, neither.
That's why it's so sacred.

20:50.115 --> 20:54.415
The point is, I was wrong.
I Iost controI.

20:55.153 --> 20:56.245
AshIey, baby...

20:58.690 --> 21:02.524
in the future, I hope you'II do
what I say and not what I did.

21:03.562 --> 21:06.395
Even though it feIt good
hitting that jerk tonight...

21:06.732 --> 21:08.131
reaIIy, reaIIy good...

21:09.735 --> 21:11.202
I was wrong.

21:11.536 --> 21:14.096
Sometimes, what feeIs good is wrong.

21:16.575 --> 21:17.803
Yeah.

21:21.179 --> 21:25.172
Everything that feeIs good is wrong.
Everything. Do you understand me?

21:25.250 --> 21:27.548
Yes. Okay.

22:02.888 --> 22:03.877
EngIish
