01:45.000 --> 01:47.867
I'm so sorry. Can you help me?

01:47.969 --> 01:49.869
My tire...

01:49.971 --> 01:53.134
Sorry. I have an appointment.
I don't like to be late.

01:53.241 --> 01:55.300
Well, would you rather
be late or dead?

01:56.611 --> 01:59.341
- You don't wanna do this.
- Step out of the car.

02:07.189 --> 02:08.883
Whoo!

02:08.990 --> 02:13.324
Let's go, fellas!
Come on, baby! Yeah!

02:13.428 --> 02:15.896
Take it easy. The car's brand-new.

02:15.997 --> 02:17.726
No problem, buddy. I got this.

02:17.833 --> 02:21.269
- Baby, let's ride! Time to go!
- Let's get to the club, baby!

02:21.370 --> 02:23.270
Your parents know the kind
of company you're keeping?

02:23.372 --> 02:25.840
- Shut up!
- Dog!

02:25.941 --> 02:28.068
- This shit ain't workin', man!
- It's coded.

02:28.176 --> 02:30.201
- What's the code, man?
- I'm afraid I can't give you that.

02:30.312 --> 02:32.712
Well, I'm afraid we'll have to beat it
out of you. Let's get out of this car!

02:32.814 --> 02:34.782
Get out of the car, nigger!
Come on, man.

02:34.883 --> 02:37.852
- What you got for me, player?
What you got? - Kick your ass!

02:37.953 --> 02:40.251
- Come on, baby!
- Mm-hmm!

02:40.355 --> 02:42.516
Hold on.

02:42.624 --> 02:44.592
Just came out of the dry cleaners.

03:02.677 --> 03:06.704
Hands up!

03:07.983 --> 03:09.951
Stop moving, or I will shoot you!

03:10.051 --> 03:12.781
Don't you have homework to do?

03:14.856 --> 03:18.292
- Why don't you go and do it?
- Okay. I'm sorry.

03:21.530 --> 03:23.464
Late.

04:33.301 --> 04:36.361
Hey, hey...

04:36.471 --> 04:38.340
The game! The game! The game!

04:38.471 --> 04:41.340
What's the first rule
when entering a man's car?

04:41.443 --> 04:44.173
Respect a man's car,
a man respects you.

04:44.279 --> 04:47.009
- Rule number two?
- Greet the man.

04:47.115 --> 04:49.811
- Good afternoon, Frank.
- Good afternoon, Jack.

04:49.918 --> 04:51.184
Can we play the game now?

04:51.218 --> 04:53.684
I think your brain would be
tired after a day of school.

04:53.788 --> 04:55.517
You're just afraid I'm gonna win.

04:55.624 --> 04:57.649
I'm afraid you're gonna be too
worn out to do your homework.

04:57.759 --> 05:00.250
It's Friday.
I don't have any homework.

05:00.362 --> 05:02.523
- In that case, the game.
- Yes!

05:02.631 --> 05:05.156
But first, what's the
third rule of the car?

05:06.701 --> 05:09.169
Good.

05:24.019 --> 05:29.457
For five points. I'm white, I'm
round, but I'm not always around.

05:29.558 --> 05:32.425
- A tennis ball?
- Tennis balls are yellow.

05:46.007 --> 05:49.443
Four points. Sometimes I'm half.
Sometimes I'm whole.

05:49.544 --> 05:51.569
Sometimes a slice of me
is all you'll know.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.978
- A loaf of bread?
- No.

05:59.387 --> 06:01.378
Three points.
Sometimes I'm light.

06:01.489 --> 06:03.389
Sometimes I'm dark.
Sometimes I'm both.

06:03.491 --> 06:05.459
- I know! A light bulb!
- No.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.892
- A pizza!
- No.

07:08.657 --> 07:12.491
Audrey. Audrey!
Stop walking away from me.

07:12.594 --> 07:15.825
Listen, we've got to
finish this conversation.

07:15.930 --> 07:17.830
- Just wait.
- I've got about two and a half...

07:17.932 --> 07:20.230
Where's he goin'?

07:22.070 --> 07:24.698
Okay, look at me.

07:24.806 --> 07:28.674
Last clue for all the points.
Everyone wants to walk on me...

07:28.777 --> 07:31.007
but only a happy few ever have.

07:31.112 --> 07:33.171
Take your time.

07:41.156 --> 07:44.717
- Hey, bud. - Shh! Mom, it's
the game. I'm trying to think.

07:44.826 --> 07:47.056
Sorry. Hey, Frank.
How are you today?

07:47.162 --> 07:50.393
- Well, Mrs. Billings.
- Frank, can I team up with Mom?

07:50.498 --> 07:53.194
- I don't know. It's not in the rules.
- Come on.

07:53.301 --> 07:56.099
What's the point in having rules
if you can't bend 'em?

07:56.204 --> 07:58.104
Okay. Just this once.

07:58.206 --> 08:00.071
- Yeah!
- All right.

08:00.175 --> 08:02.075
Give me some clues.

08:02.177 --> 08:04.737
It's round,
but not always around.

08:04.846 --> 08:07.872
It's light sometimes. It's dark
sometimes. It's both sometimes.

08:07.982 --> 08:11.543
Everyone wants to walk on it,
but only a happy few ever have.

08:11.653 --> 08:13.951
Hmm. That is a hard one.

08:14.055 --> 08:16.216
Tell me about it.

08:17.926 --> 08:20.394
The moon!

08:20.495 --> 08:22.463
- Correct.
- Whoo!

08:22.564 --> 08:24.464
Good job. Good job.
All right. Come on.

08:24.566 --> 08:26.591
- See you Monday.
- Bye, Frank. Thanks.

08:26.701 --> 08:29.693
- Keep your snacks in the kitchen.
- Bye, Mom!

08:29.804 --> 08:32.898
Hey, he's really taken to you in
the month you've been with us.

08:33.006 --> 08:34.575
Likewise.

08:34.650 --> 08:37.299
It's too bad you can't stay on
after Tony gets back.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.360
It was just a favor.

08:38.413 --> 08:40.539
I don't usually do
this sort of a job.

08:40.648 --> 08:43.879
I thought you were
a professional driver?

08:43.985 --> 08:45.976
A different kind of driving.

08:48.289 --> 08:51.315
Well, we're all gonna
miss you when you're gone.

08:59.234 --> 09:03.466
And... thank you
for what you did.

09:03.571 --> 09:05.835
For what?

09:05.940 --> 09:10.104
For turning the car around so that
Jack wouldn't have to see us fighting.

09:10.211 --> 09:14.147
- You really know kids, don't you?
- I know fighting.

09:14.249 --> 09:17.946
He hasn't seen Jack in months.
And then when he gets back here...

09:18.052 --> 09:20.612
all I can hear
is what I'm doing wrong?

09:20.722 --> 09:22.690
You'd think that after
being separated for a year...

09:22.791 --> 09:25.487
that he would...

09:25.593 --> 09:27.959
I'm sorry.

09:28.062 --> 09:32.021
- Um, you don't have to hear this.
- It's okay.

09:33.735 --> 09:36.260
For what it's worth, I think
you're doin' a great job with Jack.

09:36.371 --> 09:38.601
Thank you.

09:38.706 --> 09:41.539
Anytime I can be of help,
if there's anything you need...

09:41.643 --> 09:44.771
That's really sweet of you, Frank.

09:44.879 --> 09:47.507
I might have to take you up on it.

09:49.717 --> 09:52.845
Oh, uh, I almost forgot.

09:52.954 --> 09:55.855
I'm supposed to take Jack to the doctor
tomorrow morning for his annual checkup...

09:55.957 --> 09:57.982
but I'm organizing
a surprise party for him...

09:58.092 --> 10:00.788
even though his birthday's
not until next week.

10:00.895 --> 10:04.353
I thought it would be nice
since his dad's in town.

10:04.465 --> 10:06.956
So while I decorate
and, um, his friends arrive...

10:07.068 --> 10:09.298
I was thinking
if you wouldn't mind...

10:09.404 --> 10:11.998
- I'll take him.  - I feel kind
of funny cutting into your weekend.

10:12.106 --> 10:14.973
I'm just picking up a friend
at the airport later on in the day.

10:15.076 --> 10:17.203
Oh. That's nice.

10:17.312 --> 10:21.112
- What is?  - The guys on security
say you're a bit of a loner.

10:21.216 --> 10:24.014
Um, so it's just- it's just nice
to hear you have a friend.

10:24.118 --> 10:27.576
He's not really a friend.
He's French.

10:29.123 --> 10:31.990
I'll call you back.

10:32.093 --> 10:35.256
Audrey, I'd like
to finish our conversation.

10:40.468 --> 10:43.494
Well, if anything comes up between
now and then, you have my cell.

10:43.605 --> 10:45.573
Nothing will come up,
Mrs. Billings.

10:45.673 --> 10:49.370
- Audrey.
- Audrey.

11:19.140 --> 11:22.473
- Yeah, hello?
- Confirmed for tomorrow, 9:00 a.m.

12:11.192 --> 12:13.160
Tomorrow, 9:00 a.m.
Only change...

12:13.261 --> 12:15.229
the driver will be taking him,
not the mother.

12:15.330 --> 12:17.355
Even better.

12:21.436 --> 12:24.030
Vasily.

12:35.650 --> 12:38.380
- Is it stable?
- Yes, it's stable.

12:38.486 --> 12:40.784
And the antidote?

12:47.562 --> 12:50.122
See you tomorrow, gentlemen.

13:01.809 --> 13:03.834
And in other news,
the drug enforcement ministers...

13:03.945 --> 13:07.881
of six Latin American countries arrived
in Miami today for a summit meeting.

13:07.982 --> 13:11.418
Yeah. Martin, Frank.
1156 Palmetto.

13:11.519 --> 13:13.817
I'm waiting
for an express delivery.

13:13.921 --> 13:15.980
That's what you told me
45 minutes ago.

13:16.090 --> 13:18.650
No, I don't need anything else.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.660
Just get me the pizza.

13:20.762 --> 13:23.424
- I'm not paying for that...
- Hi.

13:23.531 --> 13:27.058
Hi.

13:27.168 --> 13:29.898
So, Mr. Martin, that's one
medium pie, no mozzarella...

13:30.004 --> 13:33.337
Extra olives and extra anchovies,
which amounts to 11.95.

13:33.441 --> 13:36.604
- I hope you're hungry.
- You have no idea.

13:36.711 --> 13:40.044
I apologize for the delay, sir.

13:41.649 --> 13:43.674
Mrs. Billings.

13:43.785 --> 13:48.620
Uh-uh. Audrey. Audrey.

13:48.723 --> 13:50.657
What are you doin'?

13:50.758 --> 13:52.749
What does it look like I'm doing?

13:52.860 --> 13:55.124
What, you've been drinking?

13:55.229 --> 13:57.129
A little.

13:58.966 --> 14:00.900
You said if I needed anything...

14:01.002 --> 14:03.436
I can't.

14:03.538 --> 14:06.268
Why? Because of who I am?

14:06.374 --> 14:08.865
Because of who I am.

14:19.687 --> 14:21.712
I feel so lost.

14:21.823 --> 14:23.586
So confused.

14:25.026 --> 14:26.994
Who isn't?

14:37.238 --> 14:39.763
Thank you, Frank...

14:39.874 --> 14:44.777
for the time and...
the respect.

14:46.447 --> 14:49.041
I think it's what
I needed the most.

14:51.252 --> 14:53.220
Bye.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.689
- Am I gonna get a shot?
- I don't know.

15:51.312 --> 15:53.303
Geez! Um, we're not open yet.

15:53.414 --> 15:56.212
It's an emergency. I need to see
the doctor immediately.

15:56.317 --> 16:00.754
Right. Dr. Copeland, uh, if you'll come
out here, please. We have an issue.

16:00.855 --> 16:03.346
You'll have to fill out some papers
stating the medical problem.

16:03.457 --> 16:06.984
Actually,
my problem's not medical.

16:07.094 --> 16:09.528
- It's psychological.
- Yes, Laura?

16:09.630 --> 16:12.599
- What seems to be the problem?
- Me.

16:13.801 --> 16:16.326
I hate shots.

16:16.437 --> 16:20.464
Number one: There's no guarantee
you're getting a shot.

16:20.575 --> 16:24.375
So there's no sense in getting all worked
up over something that might not happen.

16:30.551 --> 16:33.714
- Give me the good news.
- Doctor said I'm cured.

16:33.821 --> 16:36.346
Frank, it hurts a lot.

16:36.457 --> 16:39.119
- I'd never let anyone hurt you a lot.
- Promise?

16:39.227 --> 16:42.958
You know my fourth rule?
Never make a promise you can't keep.

16:43.064 --> 16:45.362
Come on.

16:47.435 --> 16:49.665
Close the door.

16:55.576 --> 16:58.477
Come on.

17:05.685 --> 17:08.883
- May I help you?
- Jack Billings to see Dr. Copeland.

17:08.990 --> 17:11.823
I'm sorry. He's out sick today.
He'll be seeing Dr. Tyberg.

17:11.925 --> 17:16.089
- I like Dr. Copeland.
- Don't worry. Dr. Tyberg's very nice.

17:16.196 --> 17:18.494
Now, if you'll just
take him into room 3.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.894
Where's Miss Laura?

17:20.001 --> 17:21.935
- Who?
- You're standing at her desk.

17:22.036 --> 17:24.128
That Miss Laura.
She's out sick too.

17:24.238 --> 17:28.299
There's a lot of flu going around.
Now, come on. Doctor's got a busy day.

17:28.409 --> 17:31.606
Come on. It'll be over
before you know it.

17:33.114 --> 17:35.776
Hey, hey!

17:35.883 --> 17:38.443
I'm Dr. Tyberg.

17:38.552 --> 17:40.144
Can't I wait for my doctor?

17:40.254 --> 17:43.985
Unfortunately, your doctor
was called away on emergency.

17:44.091 --> 17:47.185
- Your nurse said he had the flu.
- That was the emergency.

17:47.295 --> 17:49.525
He came down with flu very quickly.

17:49.630 --> 17:52.997
So, the sooner we start,
the sooner we finish.

17:53.100 --> 17:56.263
Eh? Come. I show you
something very cool.

17:58.105 --> 18:00.869
I'm sorry.
Doctor-patient privacy in room.

18:00.975 --> 18:04.706
But you can wait in reception area,
or glass of water, or...

18:04.812 --> 18:08.680
Hey, trust me.
I'm doctor.

18:08.783 --> 18:11.149
Oh, it's-it's phone.

18:13.921 --> 18:16.481
- Yeah.
- Allo, allo.

18:16.590 --> 18:18.490
Frank, I'm here.

18:18.592 --> 18:21.288
- You're early.
- Yeah. We had fantastic tailwinds.

18:21.395 --> 18:24.057
Two hours of my vacation
just like that.

18:24.165 --> 18:28.067
From now on, it's the only way
I fly, Frank. Tailwinds or nothing.

18:28.169 --> 18:29.830
Glad you made it.

18:32.406 --> 18:34.306
Hello?

18:34.408 --> 18:37.707
Sorry. Dr. Dunietz is not in today.
Call back Monday.

18:43.451 --> 18:45.351
Listen, Inspector,
I'm a little tied up.

18:45.453 --> 18:47.887
You mind taking a cab?
You have the address, yes?

18:47.988 --> 18:52.152
Thank you. You know, I heard
the fish down here is fantastic.

18:52.259 --> 18:56.320
I could make us bouillabaisse.
You like bouillabaisse, Frank?

18:56.430 --> 18:58.227
I gotta go.

18:59.767 --> 19:01.667
Frank!

19:01.769 --> 19:03.737
You know, maybe it's better if we wait
for his regular doctor to come back.

19:03.838 --> 19:06.830
It's very important that
he receives immunizations.

19:06.941 --> 19:09.239
Well, I'm sure it is. But a week
won't make a difference.

19:09.343 --> 19:11.607
No, we're doing...

19:32.833 --> 19:34.630
Keep going, Jack!

20:44.872 --> 20:48.273
Look at me. Look at me.

20:48.375 --> 20:51.435
- Remember my promise?
- Yes.

21:12.066 --> 21:14.227
- It's me!
- Get out!

21:18.439 --> 21:20.703
Frank.

21:49.603 --> 21:51.503
Shit!

21:59.980 --> 22:03.848
The patient's not cooperating.
Prep the vehicle.

22:16.997 --> 22:19.397
Come on! Hurry!

22:24.672 --> 22:27.368
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

22:54.068 --> 22:56.798
Freeze!
Drop your weapon!

22:56.904 --> 22:58.929
- Get down!
- Put your guns on the ground!

22:59.039 --> 23:01.633
- Si.
- They got away.

23:01.742 --> 23:04.472
- God!
- Plan "B"?

23:04.578 --> 23:07.809
Yes, plan "B."

23:26.400 --> 23:29.597
- Oh, you made it.
- Uh-huh.

23:29.703 --> 23:32.467
- Aw. What's that?
- Jack's birthday present.

23:32.573 --> 23:35.974
Baseball uniform,
cleats, glove and a bat.

23:36.076 --> 23:38.340
Whoo-hoo!

23:38.445 --> 23:42.279
- It's his favorite sport.
- It was last year.

23:42.383 --> 23:45.511
He's on a soccer team now,
and he's actually really good.

23:45.619 --> 23:47.814
- You know, you should see him sometime.
- Hello?

23:49.123 --> 23:51.717
Mr. And Mrs. Billings,
they're coming!

23:51.825 --> 23:53.520
Hide, everyone! Hide!

24:01.235 --> 24:03.396
- Yes?
- Good morning, Mr. Driver.

24:03.504 --> 24:06.496
- Who is this? - Look in your rear-view
mirror, and you'll see who it is.

24:08.509 --> 24:11.171
I know what you're thinking.
Bulletproof glass.

24:11.278 --> 24:13.143
So now you'll tell me,
in your experience...

24:13.247 --> 24:16.876
... which, judging from the little
performance you put on back at the office

24:16.984 --> 24:19.646
goes way beyond just driving
children to school and back...

24:19.753 --> 24:23.917
does bulletproof glass stop
a 7.62 armor-piercing round?

24:24.024 --> 24:27.084
Frank, why did you stop the car?

24:29.930 --> 24:32.900
Don't bother moving.
I've triangulated 300 feet away.

24:32.980 --> 24:34.326
Come on, Frank. Pick up.

24:34.368 --> 24:37.360
None of this would have been necessary
if you had not screwed up my plan.

24:37.471 --> 24:39.837
So, now I'm going to tell you
how to set things right.

24:39.940 --> 24:42.067
Someone is going to appear
in a few seconds.

24:55.289 --> 24:57.257
Let her in.

25:03.797 --> 25:07.062
Driver?

25:07.167 --> 25:08.896
Good boy. Good boy.

25:14.241 --> 25:16.903
Hi.

25:17.010 --> 25:19.069
Leave it on.

25:21.248 --> 25:23.773
Personally, I hate kids.

25:23.884 --> 25:26.079
Now, I don't know what
your feelings are on the subject...

25:26.186 --> 25:30.418
but if you ever wanna have any, make
no moves but the moves I tell you to make.

25:31.892 --> 25:33.757
You're in her hands now, amigo mio.

25:33.861 --> 25:36.796
They can be very gentle hands,
or they can be the hands from hell.

25:36.897 --> 25:41.732
- Trust me on this one.
- Trust him on this one. Now, drive!

26:24.578 --> 26:26.637
Make a left!

26:26.747 --> 26:29.215
I said left!

26:49.603 --> 26:51.503
Listen, we keep doing this
your way...

26:51.605 --> 26:53.800
no matter how many rights and lefts
we make, they're gonna catch us.

26:53.907 --> 26:56.808
- Let me do this my way so no one gets hurt.
- Where's the fun in that?

26:56.910 --> 26:59.538
Let's save the fun for later.

27:07.354 --> 27:09.822
Hey! Look out!

28:52.025 --> 28:53.267
Not bad.

28:53.325 --> 28:55.351
Didn't your mother ever
teach you to say thank you?

28:55.395 --> 28:57.955
Yeah. She tried
and failed miserably.

28:58.065 --> 29:02.195
- I think we lost them.
- Think again.

29:06.707 --> 29:09.267
Thought complete. Let's go.

29:39.106 --> 29:41.074
What do you mean,
you can't find him?

29:41.174 --> 29:44.371
He's one man in one car!
He's a chauffeur, for Christ's sakes!

29:44.478 --> 29:47.675
Not exactly, sir. We think there's
a possibility he may have been in on it.

29:47.781 --> 29:50.750
- That's impossible.
- How would you know?

29:50.851 --> 29:53.185
He's been working here for a month.
He could've been setting this up...

29:53.200 --> 29:55.654
the whole time and you wouldn't
have known any different.

29:55.756 --> 30:00.420
- You are such an expert on
knowing people! - His background.

30:00.527 --> 30:03.394
He's ex-special forces. Head of an
elite commando unit for five years...

30:03.497 --> 30:05.089
specialized in search and destroy.

30:05.198 --> 30:09.157
Been in and out of Lebanon,
Syria, Sudan. The man is a hunter.

30:09.269 --> 30:11.931
I don't care what his skills are.
I don't care where he's from.

30:12.039 --> 30:15.167
This is not a war zone!
This is an American city!

30:15.275 --> 30:17.505
Where's my son?

30:45.172 --> 30:48.073
Last stop. All out.

30:50.544 --> 30:52.512
You're quite a guy.

30:52.612 --> 30:54.944
Another time,
another place...

30:55.048 --> 30:58.950
you and me, baby,
the pleasure we could have.

31:04.858 --> 31:06.758
Beauty.

31:06.860 --> 31:08.259
Frank.

31:10.263 --> 31:12.254
Frank!

31:13.567 --> 31:15.728
Frank!

31:15.836 --> 31:18.634
Not what you expected when
you reported for work this morning.

31:18.738 --> 31:20.638
Is it, Frank? No?

31:20.740 --> 31:23.402
Is that what passes
for wit in this circle?

31:23.510 --> 31:26.001
In this circle, my friend...

31:26.113 --> 31:28.308
wit is not a requirement of the job.

31:28.415 --> 31:30.007
Brutality, yes.

31:30.117 --> 31:32.517
An ability to inflict pain,
absolutely.

31:32.619 --> 31:37.852
A certain psychotic, moral ignorance,
blind obedience- all required.

31:37.958 --> 31:40.449
But not wit.
How was it?

31:40.560 --> 31:42.926
- Fun.
- Only the beginning, my love.

31:44.564 --> 31:46.464
What's this all about?

31:46.566 --> 31:48.830
A timely question. Max?

31:50.570 --> 31:52.697
Pardon me.

31:58.945 --> 32:01.345
Hello?

32:01.448 --> 32:04.645
Put me on the speaker so you don't
have to repeat the instructions.

32:04.751 --> 32:08.778
In the next two hours, you'll get
$5 million in non-sequential $100 bills.

32:08.889 --> 32:10.516
You put them in
a waterproof suitcase.

32:10.624 --> 32:13.058
You go to the
Bayfront Park personally.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.287
There will be a blue Chrysler
parked on the sand.

32:15.395 --> 32:17.955
You place the suitcase
in the trunk, and you leave.

32:18.064 --> 32:20.658
I don't know if I can get
five million dollars in two hours.

32:20.767 --> 32:22.735
Mr. Billings, please.
I read the newspapers.

32:22.836 --> 32:24.804
The day you were appointed
to your current position...

32:24.905 --> 32:27.237
your net worth exceeded
100 million dollars.

32:27.340 --> 32:29.035
So, you won't even feel the bite.

32:29.142 --> 32:32.578
What guarantee do I have
that you won't harm my son?

32:32.679 --> 32:35.876
Guarantee, Mr. Billings? Huh?

32:35.982 --> 32:38.280
I'm not a car dealer.
Don't let the charming accent...

32:38.385 --> 32:41.115
and my grammatical,
impeccable syntax mislead you.

32:41.221 --> 32:43.416
I live in the jungle,
and in the jungle...

32:43.523 --> 32:45.423
you either eat or be eaten.

32:45.525 --> 32:48.050
But in the spirit of doing business,
here is the guarantee.

32:48.161 --> 32:51.858
Ten minutes past the deadline, if the
money doesn't arrive, I send a finger.

32:51.965 --> 32:55.765
Twenty minutes, a hand.
Thirty minutes, a foot.

32:55.869 --> 32:58.099
Sounds like we have a deal,
don't we, Mr. Billings?

32:58.205 --> 33:00.196
You have a deal.

33:02.409 --> 33:05.037
Could we please speak to our son?

33:06.446 --> 33:08.607
Mommy! Mommy!

33:08.715 --> 33:11.775
You have two hours, Mr. Billings...

33:11.885 --> 33:14.012
starting now.

33:15.956 --> 33:19.619
- Just get my son!
- All right. All right.

33:19.726 --> 33:23.457
Frank, you promised you
wouldn't let anybody hurt me!

33:23.563 --> 33:25.292
You promised!

33:25.398 --> 33:28.026
Never make promises
you can't keep, my friend.

33:28.134 --> 33:31.433
I don't.
It's one of my rules.

33:31.538 --> 33:34.666
Wow! Bravo!

33:34.774 --> 33:37.572
A man who lives his life
by the rules.

33:37.677 --> 33:41.135
- Well, in my world, rules are
meant to be broken. - Not in mine.

33:41.248 --> 33:45.048
This time, you're gonna
have to make an exception. Go.

34:13.045 --> 34:15.606
Prego.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.154
- Go.
- Hey, driver!

34:32.799 --> 34:36.496
No, no. Wait, wait. A little distance
between us isn't a bad thing.

34:38.905 --> 34:41.168
Andiamo!

34:49.783 --> 34:52.183
Now.

35:26.486 --> 35:28.647
Hold on. No, hang on.
Wait for the signal.

35:28.755 --> 35:30.222
- Hello?
- It's me.

35:30.323 --> 35:32.883
- We've got something here, gentlemen.
- You son of a bitch!

35:32.992 --> 35:34.687
Look, I had nothing
to do with this.

35:34.794 --> 35:36.694
One scratch on his head,
one hair out of place...

35:36.796 --> 35:38.423
Let me speak to who's in charge.

35:38.500 --> 35:39.950
Hello, Frank?
This is U.S. Marshal Stappleton.

35:39.960 --> 35:40.950
You have to act fast.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.662
- There are three boats.
- Just tell us where you are.

35:43.770 --> 35:46.398
Get a plane up over the Intracoastal.
They're heading north.

35:46.506 --> 35:49.066
- Just tell me where you are.
- Just tell us where you are!

35:49.175 --> 35:52.076
- Hello, Frank?
- Got it.

36:18.204 --> 36:22.573
Allo.

36:22.675 --> 36:24.370
Tarconi, it's me.
Get out of the house.

36:24.477 --> 36:26.877
No. I was just prepping
the madeleines, and...

36:26.980 --> 36:28.777
Forget the madeleines.
Just get out.

36:28.882 --> 36:31.407
- And go where?
- Anywhere. The beach. Go to the beach.

36:31.518 --> 36:36.751
Oh, the beach. Oh, the famous
Miami Beach. Oh, my dream!

36:36.856 --> 36:39.256
I would love to go to the beach.

36:42.662 --> 36:45.256
- Maybe not.
- Freeze!

36:45.365 --> 36:48.095
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm the cook.

36:50.203 --> 36:53.604
Oh! It's a mistake!
A terrible mistake!

36:55.275 --> 36:59.302
Why we can't all just get along?

36:59.412 --> 37:01.312
You know?

37:16.129 --> 37:18.495
- Hello?
- It's Frank. Don't hang up.

37:18.598 --> 37:20.566
Pretend it's someone else.

37:21.634 --> 37:24.467
Hi, Susan.

37:24.571 --> 37:27.199
Uh, no, I'm just here at home.

37:27.307 --> 37:30.765
I didn't do it, Audrey. She had
a gun on Jack. I had no choice.

37:30.877 --> 37:34.176
Yeah, I saw that.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.840
- What do you know?
- It's more than a kidnapping.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.508
They called and asked for a ransom.

37:38.618 --> 37:41.178
The doctors there were fake.
They were trying to give Jack a shot...

37:41.287 --> 37:43.380
when I interrupted them.

37:46.659 --> 37:49.355
Audrey, I promised Jack
I wouldn't let anyone hurt him.

37:49.462 --> 37:52.454
- I'm not gonna break that promise.
- Frank?

37:52.565 --> 37:54.931
I'll call you back.

37:57.103 --> 37:59.333
Audrey?

37:59.439 --> 38:01.532
Is everything all right?

38:01.641 --> 38:04.542
That's a pretty stupid question to
ask right now, don't you think, Jeff?

38:12.185 --> 38:16.178
All right, so tell me again,
Inspector Tarconi...

38:16.289 --> 38:20.316
why you didn't immediately
identify yourself as a police officer.

38:22.228 --> 38:26.995
Oh. I was, uh, overwhelmed by the
effectiveness of your operation...

38:27.100 --> 38:30.001
and the sophistication
of your equipment.

38:30.103 --> 38:33.334
You know, I work in a small
office in small town.

38:33.439 --> 38:35.873
We only have small crimes.

38:35.975 --> 38:37.875
I must admit,
I was a little insecure.

38:37.977 --> 38:39.877
And you and Frank Martin
are friends, right?

38:39.979 --> 38:43.710
A friend? Oh, I wouldn't say
exactly a friend.

38:43.816 --> 38:46.080
I know him.
We have a relationship.

38:46.185 --> 38:49.086
- A long relationship?
- Not so long.

38:49.188 --> 38:52.021
- But they found you cookin'
in his house! - I'm French!

38:52.125 --> 38:53.752
- So?
- We don't need to know someone...

38:53.860 --> 38:55.760
for a long time
in order to cook for them.

38:55.862 --> 38:59.298
It's our way of breaking the ice.
Take, for example, you.

38:59.399 --> 39:03.460
This sandwich and coffee.

39:03.570 --> 39:06.437
You will pardon me to think so,
but it's not very good.

39:06.539 --> 39:09.303
Yeah, I know. It sucks. But what
does that got to do with anything?

39:09.409 --> 39:12.640
Do you have a kitchen?

39:12.745 --> 39:14.872
Stay back. Stay back.

40:40.099 --> 40:42.090
Don't move!

40:42.201 --> 40:45.034
Smith! Drop it.

40:54.180 --> 40:56.080
Fuck!

40:56.182 --> 40:58.582
Aah!

41:09.028 --> 41:11.656
I just found this.

41:11.764 --> 41:13.664
Oh, Jesus!

41:13.766 --> 41:15.825
- What happened?
- We'll take care of it for you.

41:23.910 --> 41:26.708
- Are you sure this is safe?
- Look over your shoulder.

41:26.813 --> 41:29.247
We got you covered.

41:38.324 --> 41:40.417
As my mother used to say...

41:40.526 --> 41:45.225
- "A meal is only limited
by your imagination." - Hmm!

41:45.331 --> 41:46.923
That's cr幦e brul嶪
and croque monsieur.

41:47.033 --> 41:48.625
- Cream brul嶪.
- Cr幦e brul嶪.

41:48.735 --> 41:50.965
- Croque monsieur.
- Croque monsieur.

41:53.606 --> 41:55.403
- Oui?
- Where are you?

41:55.508 --> 41:59.035
- Cooking.
- Cooking? Can you talk?

41:59.145 --> 42:02.410
- Speak of the devil. My mother.
- Mom!

42:02.515 --> 42:07.418
Please, um, do you mind?
Thank you.

42:13.826 --> 42:16.056
May I ask who you're cooking for?

42:16.162 --> 42:17.891
For the U.S. Marshals.

42:17.997 --> 42:21.489
But once they found my badge,
they were very polite.

42:21.601 --> 42:23.796
They gave me coffee
and a sandwich.

42:23.903 --> 42:26.428
You wouldn't believe what passes
for food in this place, Frank.

42:26.539 --> 42:28.507
But I'm correcting the situation...

42:28.608 --> 42:32.203
while they wait for my chief
to call back and confirm everything.

42:32.311 --> 42:36.975
Of course, that might take a while.
He's never there.

42:37.083 --> 42:40.678
- Anything about me? - Yes.
They are very interested about you.

42:40.787 --> 42:44.587
They want to know where you are.
Where are you?

42:44.690 --> 42:47.022
Nowhere for very long.
Listen, hold on.

42:51.731 --> 42:54.495
Do you have access to a computer?

42:54.600 --> 42:58.468
It's years since having access
to something decent.

43:14.120 --> 43:16.486
Oh. Handsome fellow.
Who is he?

43:16.589 --> 43:18.784
That's what I need to know.
Do they have an I.D. Program?

43:18.891 --> 43:21.519
You'll forgive me,
but I'm not so used to this system.

43:21.627 --> 43:24.494
Back home, there is
one computer for 10 of us.

43:24.597 --> 43:26.963
So, how is it with you, Frank?

43:27.066 --> 43:29.034
It's a complicated story.

43:29.135 --> 43:32.036
- You mean, you are in the shit?
- You might say that.

43:32.138 --> 43:34.800
In other words,
you're not arrested.

43:34.907 --> 43:39.736
Ah! Voil? A Russian biologist
with advanced degrees...

43:39.744 --> 43:43.240
from the state laboratory for
biological warfare in Siberia.

43:43.349 --> 43:46.477
- Do we have an address?
- Miami. Park West.

43:46.586 --> 43:49.453
King Street, number 11.

45:30.256 --> 45:33.089
Get out!

45:49.875 --> 45:52.673
Go! Go! Go!

46:00.252 --> 46:02.015
Hey!

46:05.257 --> 46:08.124
- What are you doing?
- Trying to catch a bus.

46:11.731 --> 46:14.393
Come on!

46:28.748 --> 46:32.650
What are you doing, driver?
Not so good on the water, huh?

46:55.975 --> 46:58.375
Hit the ground!

47:09.855 --> 47:12.688
- Okay. Okay.
- Tell me about the doctor's office.

47:12.792 --> 47:16.284
- What doctor's office? - The one where
you tried to stick the kid with this.

47:16.395 --> 47:19.592
Wanna tell me?

47:27.807 --> 47:31.538
Do you know what you have done?
Do you know what you have done?

47:31.644 --> 47:34.272
Obviously something not
conducive to your good health...

47:34.380 --> 47:36.780
which is all I needed to know
in the first place.

47:36.882 --> 47:40.579
Have a good life.
What's left of it.

47:56.569 --> 47:59.299
Outpost to Base.
The ransom is still there.

47:59.405 --> 48:02.710
Thanks. The ransom still
hasn't been picked up.

48:02.750 --> 48:03.750
What does that mean?

48:03.760 --> 48:05.400
Don't worry.
Right now it means nothing.

48:05.410 --> 48:06.708
What if it's not a kidnapping?

48:06.718 --> 48:08.800
I've worked with over 15
kidnapping cases in two years.

48:08.810 --> 48:11.840
You think that if they don't take
the ransom, I'm gonna get my son back?

48:11.850 --> 48:14.850
Audrey, don't make this any more
complicated than it already is.

48:14.954 --> 48:18.981
I'm not making this complicated,
Jefferson. It's because of your job.

48:19.091 --> 48:20.956
What does my job
have to do with any of this?

48:21.060 --> 48:22.960
It has everything to do with it.

48:23.062 --> 48:26.589
Don't you understand? Because you
became famous, we became the targets.

48:26.699 --> 48:28.599
And no matter what
any of you all think...

48:28.701 --> 48:31.829
the only one who's out there
trying to get Jack back is Frank.

48:31.937 --> 48:33.250
Frank? The chauffeur?

48:33.270 --> 48:35.698
You spoke with Frank Martin
and didn't tell us about it?

48:35.738 --> 48:37.500
What the hell are you
doing talking to him?

48:37.510 --> 48:39.740
Because he is the last
person who saw Jack alive!

48:39.778 --> 48:43.043
We found the boy.

49:07.606 --> 49:09.870
It shut down.

49:09.975 --> 49:11.840
- Hard drive blew.
- Get another one in there.

49:11.944 --> 49:14.606
- Yes, sir.
- How long is it gonna take?

49:14.713 --> 49:16.874
Ma'am, we're going
as fast as we can.

49:16.982 --> 49:19.109
- He can suffocate in there!
- Ma'am, stay calm.

49:19.218 --> 49:21.686
- It's my son!
- Audrey, let them work.

49:21.787 --> 49:23.507
Are you just gonna sit there
and do nothing?

49:23.517 --> 49:24.617
Audrey, they're experts!

49:24.657 --> 49:27.217
Everyone is an expert!
I've had it with all of you!

49:28.594 --> 49:29.993
Audrey!

49:33.432 --> 49:37.732
Audrey! Audrey!

49:41.974 --> 49:43.999
Audrey!

49:46.312 --> 49:49.304
Mommy! Mommy!

49:51.050 --> 49:53.382
Jack!

49:53.485 --> 49:55.385
Are you okay?

50:00.793 --> 50:02.693
Here you go, little buddy.

50:07.566 --> 50:10.296
Breathe. Come on, breathe.

50:10.402 --> 50:12.962
You're the devil.

50:13.072 --> 50:15.063
I wish.

50:50.609 --> 50:54.238
- Tipov! No!
- Shit! Shit!

50:54.346 --> 50:56.780
Dimitri, you scared
shit in me!

50:56.882 --> 50:58.816
- Where is Sonavitch?
- He's in chamber.

50:58.917 --> 51:00.942
- I need to speak with him.
- He won't be long.

51:01.053 --> 51:03.749
Sit down!
Listen Panasonic.

51:03.856 --> 51:06.518
It's rock music. It's good.

52:44.890 --> 52:46.558
- What was that?
- I don't know.

52:46.558 --> 52:47.024
- What was that?
- I don't know.

52:47.126 --> 52:48.787
Shit!

52:50.062 --> 52:52.223
- What are you doing here?
- I need antidote.

52:52.331 --> 52:55.425
The driver- He inject me
with virus. Look.

52:55.534 --> 52:57.627
Dimitri, where would he
get the virus?

52:57.736 --> 52:59.897
The one we left
in doctor's surgery.

53:00.005 --> 53:02.974
Please, I need antidote.
I am sick.

53:03.075 --> 53:07.239
Calm down. You're not sick. You have
four hours before the virus is active.

53:07.346 --> 53:09.644
You know that.
You worked on creating it.

53:10.883 --> 53:12.612
- Open fridge.
- I'm telling you...

53:12.718 --> 53:14.242
Open fridge!

53:14.353 --> 53:17.151
Open fridge.

53:17.256 --> 53:19.315
Open the fridge!

53:19.425 --> 53:23.725
Please. Insurance policy.
How many do you have?

53:23.829 --> 53:26.730
Two doses. Enough
for Tipov and myself.

53:30.269 --> 53:33.170
Tipov's policy canceled.
There is one for me.

53:34.373 --> 53:37.638
And I want it now.
Come on! Come on!

53:38.844 --> 53:41.244
Let's do it!

53:41.346 --> 53:43.644
- Let's not.
- Who are you?

53:43.749 --> 53:45.979
- Driver, there is enough for two of us.
- You don't need it.

53:46.084 --> 53:48.143
- But you injected me!
- With water.

53:48.253 --> 53:50.153
I'm not sick?

53:50.255 --> 53:52.189
- Not sick.
- Water?

53:52.291 --> 53:55.089
Water.

53:55.194 --> 53:57.788
Son of bitch!

53:59.798 --> 54:03.199
Good. The problem is solved.
One dose for each of us.

54:03.302 --> 54:06.601
- It's not for us.
- Ah, one for you: One for the child.

54:06.705 --> 54:10.471
- Your devotion is touching.
- My patience is about to run out.

54:14.713 --> 54:17.705
- Tell me about the virus.
- Okay.

54:17.816 --> 54:20.944
- What do you want to know?
- Everything. For starters, what is it?

54:21.053 --> 54:24.614
It's a recombinant retro-immune
double-polymorphing efferent.

54:24.723 --> 54:27.624
The child will die.
Anyone he breathes on will die.

54:27.726 --> 54:29.557
- And then it's over.
- What do you mean, it's over?

54:29.661 --> 54:33.188
The virus is designed
to go inert after 24 hours.

54:33.298 --> 54:36.529
Thanks for the lesson.
Now give me the vials.

54:36.635 --> 54:39.729
You really want to play
superhero, don't you?

54:39.838 --> 54:43.035
Well, let's see if you can fly.

55:19.244 --> 55:22.907
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

56:25.911 --> 56:27.811
There's nothing to worry about.

56:27.913 --> 56:29.763
It's just a simple viral infection

56:29.783 --> 56:31.783
combined with the stress
of what happened.

56:31.883 --> 56:33.809
It should pass in a day or two.

56:33.883 --> 56:34.909
I gave him something
to help him sleep.

56:35.020 --> 56:37.921
Call me if anything arises.

56:38.023 --> 56:40.116
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Doctor.

56:41.560 --> 56:45.656
You know, Audrey,
all of this has...

56:45.764 --> 56:49.359
Well, it's made me realize
what a fool I've been...

56:49.468 --> 56:53.336
with Jack... and with you.

56:55.073 --> 56:58.770
Are you okay?

56:58.877 --> 57:01.141
Mr. Billings, we're running late.

57:01.246 --> 57:04.306
I'll be right out.

57:04.416 --> 57:07.544
I'd like to come by
after the conference.

57:07.653 --> 57:12.022
Check on Jack.
Check on you.

57:15.093 --> 57:18.688
Good. I'll see you soon.

57:18.797 --> 57:21.061
They're here if you need them.

57:33.111 --> 57:36.638
- You all right, ma'am?
- I'm fine.

57:39.885 --> 57:42.979
- Hello?
- It's me.

57:43.088 --> 57:45.318
- Are you okay, Mrs. Billings?
- Go to your bedroom.

57:45.424 --> 57:48.359
Hi, Susan.
How are you?

57:50.162 --> 57:53.188
I'm alone.
Where are you, Frank?

57:53.298 --> 57:55.323
Turn around.

58:04.609 --> 58:07.203
Frank, you were wrong.

58:07.312 --> 58:09.712
It was a kidnapping.
Jack is fine.

58:09.815 --> 58:11.908
Jack's been infected
with a deadly virus, Audrey.

58:12.017 --> 58:14.747
Now anyone who comes into
contact with him will die.

58:14.853 --> 58:17.879
What are you telling me?

58:17.989 --> 58:20.514
Are you telling me
that my son is gonna die?

58:20.625 --> 58:22.593
No, he's not.

58:24.730 --> 58:26.857
Once incubated, the virus
becomes airborne...

58:26.965 --> 58:29.525
so anyone he breathes on
gets infected.

58:29.634 --> 58:32.432
Your son was a weapon.
The target is his father.

58:32.537 --> 58:34.630
Jefferson? Well, why?

58:34.740 --> 58:37.402
Because of the conference.
It's the only logical answer.

58:37.509 --> 58:40.706
Every drug enforcement agency
in the hemisphere in one room.

58:40.812 --> 58:43.542
Your husband breathes:
The room dies.

58:46.518 --> 58:49.112
Please.

58:49.221 --> 58:51.416
You gotta trust me, Audrey.

58:59.397 --> 59:03.299
- Can you get to him?
- What are you gonna do?

59:03.401 --> 59:06.564
Find the guy responsible.
He has more of this.

59:07.739 --> 59:11.641
- For you and everybody else.
- For you now.

59:29.461 --> 59:31.429
We have a guest.

59:31.530 --> 59:34.465
- You're burnin' up.
- I'm okay.

59:35.867 --> 59:38.062
You gotta go. Go.

59:41.239 --> 59:42.866
Don't move!

01:00:27.619 --> 01:00:30.281
- Is the governor here?
- Everybody's gonna be here.

01:00:30.388 --> 01:00:33.687
The governor, delegates
from all over the world.

01:00:33.792 --> 01:00:35.919
Just a second. Hello?

01:00:36.027 --> 01:00:38.359
- You can't go to the conference.
- Is everything all right?

01:00:38.463 --> 01:00:41.432
...to give him a deadly virus.

01:00:41.533 --> 01:00:44.229
- I can't hear you. I'm inside.
- Now I've got it, and so do you.

01:00:44.336 --> 01:00:47.499
- Audrey, I can't hear you. - Their plan
is to infect everyone at the conference.

01:00:47.606 --> 01:00:50.040
- I'm gonna have to call you back.
- Jeff!

01:00:51.977 --> 01:00:55.879
Mr. Billings, are you all right?

01:00:55.981 --> 01:00:58.040
- I'm all right. Come on.
- You sure?

01:00:58.149 --> 01:01:00.913
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:01:20.205 --> 01:01:22.765
- Allo.
- You still a guest of the government?

01:01:22.874 --> 01:01:26.742
They gave me the five-star
accommodation.

01:01:26.845 --> 01:01:29.939
- Let me guess. You need my help?
- Are you near the computer?

01:01:30.048 --> 01:01:33.211
It's practically my pillow.

01:01:33.318 --> 01:01:36.287
- So, how do you want to start?
- I don't know. I have nothing.

01:01:36.388 --> 01:01:40.381
Ah, my favorite type
of investigation.

01:01:40.492 --> 01:01:42.790
Let's see.

01:01:42.894 --> 01:01:44.794
Alors.

01:01:44.896 --> 01:01:49.026
I'd like to take this opportunity
to introduce you to my delegates.

01:01:49.134 --> 01:01:51.864
Breathe. That's right.
Breathe, my friend. Breathe.

01:01:54.072 --> 01:01:57.007
Tomorrow, once these bastards
are out of the way...

01:01:57.108 --> 01:01:59.668
and their cooperation agreements
are dead and buried...

01:01:59.778 --> 01:02:02.269
you know what the biggest
problem is going to be?

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:05.281
- What?
- Counting the money.

01:02:09.454 --> 01:02:12.582
- I can't wait for tomorrow.
- Ay, ay, ay!

01:02:12.691 --> 01:02:15.489
It's easier with you.

01:02:16.895 --> 01:02:20.194
Ahhh, Gianni Chellini.

01:02:20.298 --> 01:02:23.062
He hires himself out to anyone
looking to make trouble...

01:02:23.168 --> 01:02:25.136
Red Brigades, Shining Path.

01:02:27.205 --> 01:02:30.368
Someone accessed the database
on the 15th floor.

01:02:30.475 --> 01:02:35.174
That's Gonzalez.
He's on vacation.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:39.808
Ah, he was behind the hostage taking
of the public ministers in Geneva.

01:02:39.918 --> 01:02:42.716
That was a nice piece of work.

01:02:47.158 --> 01:02:48.459
Give me an address.

01:02:48.558 --> 01:02:51.959
Miami, East Island,
Pelican Drive, 26900.

01:02:52.063 --> 01:02:54.361
- We found the car.
- You're one great cop, Tarconi.

01:02:54.466 --> 01:02:56.525
Ah, thank you for the compliment.

01:02:56.634 --> 01:02:59.159
Now I'm going back to sleep.

01:03:01.573 --> 01:03:04.371
Hmm. Maybe not.

01:03:06.244 --> 01:03:08.974
Move out of the way!

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:12.208
- Move over.
- What do you- Sure!

01:03:12.317 --> 01:03:15.081
This is the second gun
in my car tonight.

01:03:15.186 --> 01:03:19.418
I may be out of a job,
out of a house...

01:03:19.524 --> 01:03:21.219
Mommy?

01:03:21.326 --> 01:03:24.261
Hmm? Honey.

01:03:24.362 --> 01:03:28.059
- You feeling better?
- A little bit.

01:03:28.166 --> 01:03:30.361
Why don't you try
to go back to sleep, okay?

01:03:37.142 --> 01:03:39.667
Ma'am, are you all right?

01:03:48.486 --> 01:03:52.354
Jefferson? Jefferson, you okay?

01:04:56.821 --> 01:04:58.846
Okay, do it.

01:05:11.669 --> 01:05:15.196
- What are you doing?
- You know, last night got me thinking.

01:05:15.306 --> 01:05:18.605
How do you transport
the antidote safely?

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:20.610
We need something
that won't break...

01:05:20.712 --> 01:05:22.270
something that can't be stolen...

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.644
something totally secure.

01:05:24.749 --> 01:05:26.376
Me.

01:05:32.423 --> 01:05:34.288
Impressive.

01:05:34.392 --> 01:05:36.690
Get dressed.

01:05:37.896 --> 01:05:39.796
Stop him.

01:05:41.132 --> 01:05:44.033
- These your friends?
- Not yet.

01:05:53.278 --> 01:05:56.406
- Where'd they go?
- The garage.

01:05:56.514 --> 01:05:59.483
- I'm out of ammo.
- Me too.

01:05:59.584 --> 01:06:01.745
- So am I.
- Where are the reloads?

01:06:01.853 --> 01:06:03.684
The garage.

01:06:04.856 --> 01:06:07.723
Check the house!
Go, go, go!

01:06:11.663 --> 01:06:13.756
Forget the ammo! Get him!

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:52.461
- What you want me to do?
- Keep the meter running.

01:07:52.563 --> 01:07:56.397
Fine. Don't worry, baby.

01:07:56.501 --> 01:07:59.698
Safe now. You're safe.
You're so beautiful.

01:07:59.804 --> 01:08:02.432
Remind me of my yellow
poom-poom rider.

01:09:18.716 --> 01:09:21.549
Don't move.

01:09:21.652 --> 01:09:24.120
- Oh, Mr. Driver.
- I'll blow you into tomorrow.

01:09:24.221 --> 01:09:26.712
But then I'd bleed what you
came for all over the floor.

01:09:26.823 --> 01:09:28.724
You wouldn't want this,
would you?

01:09:28.826 --> 01:09:32.057
Not after you worked so hard
trying to get to the antidote.

01:09:32.162 --> 01:09:36.292
Take a good look, Frank Martin.
I'm a cure for what ails you.

01:09:36.401 --> 01:09:38.562
I'm the only cure for what ails you.

01:09:38.669 --> 01:09:41.934
I am the antidote.

01:09:42.038 --> 01:09:45.372
But nice try. I'm impressed.
Didn't give you enough credit.

01:09:45.475 --> 01:09:48.309
Took more than a driver
to figure this out.

01:09:48.412 --> 01:09:50.471
- I haven't figured it all out yet.
- Perhaps I can help you.

01:09:50.581 --> 01:09:53.209
What part are you a little...
how you say... thick on?

01:09:53.317 --> 01:09:55.547
You. Why?

01:09:55.653 --> 01:09:58.281
Ah, well, that's the easy part.

01:09:58.389 --> 01:10:00.721
It's a business deal,
pure and simple.

01:10:00.825 --> 01:10:02.816
I'm for hire
to the highest bidder.

01:10:02.927 --> 01:10:06.761
And in this case, the highest bidder
was the Colombian cocaine cartels...

01:10:06.864 --> 01:10:09.992
that wanted these pesky
little men off their backs.

01:10:10.101 --> 01:10:13.559
You think killing all these politicians
is gonna make things easier for them?

01:10:13.671 --> 01:10:17.163
That's not my problem.
I was hired to do a job.

01:10:17.275 --> 01:10:21.712
I did the job, like you.
Just... my pay is better.

01:10:23.181 --> 01:10:25.843
My hair and my suit too.

01:10:27.919 --> 01:10:29.978
Mm, Lola.

01:10:30.087 --> 01:10:34.456
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a plane to catch.

01:10:34.559 --> 01:10:36.652
Kill him.

01:10:36.761 --> 01:10:38.752
Ciao, ciao.

01:10:41.599 --> 01:10:43.829
Don't even blink.

01:10:43.935 --> 01:10:46.199
- What's in this for you?
- Pleasure.

01:10:49.474 --> 01:10:51.374
In killing you.

01:12:28.239 --> 01:12:31.265
We're coming to you live
from the Key Biscayne Causeway...

01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:35.539
where at least 10 police cars are in
hot pursuit of a stolen red pickup truck.

01:12:39.984 --> 01:12:43.249
Oh, my! This is just not...
Jim, are you getting that?

01:12:43.354 --> 01:12:48.155
There's another car that is swaying past
the police as if it were standing still.

01:12:48.259 --> 01:12:52.093
- Son of a bitch can drive. Whoo.
- Yes, he can.

01:13:38.542 --> 01:13:41.204
We have clearance
for takeoff, Mr. Chellini.

01:13:41.312 --> 01:13:45.874
Sit back, enjoy your flight, and we
will be in Colombia before you know it.

01:14:29.627 --> 01:14:32.221
We have a problem with the
landing gear. It won't come up.

01:14:32.329 --> 01:14:34.593
- I'm turning back to land.
- Can we fly with the problem?

01:14:34.699 --> 01:14:36.101
Yeah, theoretically.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:38.601
Then you'll land
when we get to Colombia.

01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:42.270
Go and see if you can
lift it manually.

01:14:42.373 --> 01:14:46.241
Sorry for the inconvenience,
Mr. Chellini. Nothing to worry about.

01:14:50.815 --> 01:14:52.715
Sorry. Flight's been canceled.

01:14:52.817 --> 01:14:57.584
I'm sorry to inform you
that you have been canceled.

01:14:57.688 --> 01:14:59.747
Have a seat.

01:15:00.858 --> 01:15:02.382
Relax.

01:15:04.028 --> 01:15:07.259
Drink something, and let's
get to know each other.

01:15:07.364 --> 01:15:10.800
I think I know
everything I need to know.

01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:58.934
Shit!

01:18:38.042 --> 01:18:41.239
Five points.
What has eyes but no ears...

01:18:41.345 --> 01:18:44.940
skin but no hair, it's white
inside and brown outside?

01:18:45.049 --> 01:18:46.983
- Mom?
- A worm?

01:18:47.084 --> 01:18:50.918
- Wrong. Dad?
- A caterpillar.

01:18:51.021 --> 01:18:52.921
Wrong.

01:18:53.023 --> 01:18:55.685
A potato.

01:18:57.828 --> 01:18:59.762
May I help you?

01:18:59.863 --> 01:19:01.763
I was just leaving.

01:19:01.865 --> 01:19:04.425
He'll be out of here in a couple
of weeks. Just a couple of weeks.

01:19:04.535 --> 01:19:06.469
- Coconut?
- Wrong.

01:19:06.570 --> 01:19:09.198
- A snake?
- Wrong.

01:19:10.674 --> 01:19:13.768
- A peanut?
- Yuck.

01:19:13.877 --> 01:19:15.936
- A hot dog?
- Wrong.

01:19:16.046 --> 01:19:17.980
Uh...

01:19:28.959 --> 01:19:31.553
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

01:19:31.662 --> 01:19:34.028
Didn't want you to miss your plane.

01:19:34.131 --> 01:19:36.122
That's very thoughtful of you.

01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.808
Want a ride, big boy?

01:19:45.909 --> 01:19:48.241
Check it out, man.

01:19:50.614 --> 01:19:53.139
You won't believe what
happened to me last night.

01:20:00.124 --> 01:20:03.651
I have something for you. I figured
since you never got to the beach...

01:20:03.761 --> 01:20:09.199
I know. Water is water, sand is sand.
Here, there, it's all the same.

01:20:09.299 --> 01:20:11.824
Air France flight 069 to Paris.

01:20:11.935 --> 01:20:14.597
Thank you, Frank.
It was an interesting vacation.

01:20:14.705 --> 01:20:18.905
- What more could one ask for?
- Ah. Yeah.

01:20:19.009 --> 01:20:21.477
- Au revoir, Frank.
- Au revoir, my friend.

01:20:21.578 --> 01:20:23.944
- Have a good flight.
- I doubt it.

01:20:24.048 --> 01:20:26.175
They said it is all headwinds.

01:20:26.283 --> 01:20:29.514
I guess we can't have
everything we wish for, can we?

01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:31.451
No, we can't.

01:20:46.904 --> 01:20:48.804
Yeah.

01:20:48.906 --> 01:20:51.431
I'm looking for a transporter.

01:20:54.845 --> 01:20:56.779
I'm listening.
