WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.403
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.403 --> 00:04.605
LYNETTE FOUGHT TO SAVE
HER MARRIAGE.

00:04.605 --> 00:07.608
I COULD SEE IT IN HIS EYES.
TOM STILL LOVES ME.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.610
CARLOS DECIDED
TO CHANGE CAREERS.

00:09.610 --> 00:10.781
MAYBE COUNSELING.

00:10.781 --> 00:12.543
IN ONE WEEK,
A COUNSELOR DOES MORE GOOD

00:12.543 --> 00:15.186
THAN I'VE DONE
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

00:15.186 --> 00:16.216
GOOD NEWS...

00:16.216 --> 00:18.349
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.
 OH!

00:18.349 --> 00:19.390
CAME WITH BAD NEWS.

00:19.390 --> 00:21.222
IN THE MIDDLE
OF HIS PROPOSAL,

00:21.222 --> 00:23.324
THE COPS COME BY TO ASK
ABOUT SOME DEAD BODY

00:23.324 --> 00:24.625
THEY FOUND
AT THE CONSTRUCTION SITE.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.127
SO TELL ME MORE.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.399
I TOLD 'EM THAT I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT,

00:28.399 --> 00:30.731
AND THE POLICE DON'T SEEM LIKE
THEY'RE GONNA POSE A PROBLEM.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.134
BUT IT BECAME A PROBLEM
FOR BREE...

00:33.134 --> 00:35.306
WE'RE JUST MAKING SMALL TALK
WAITING FOR HER LAWYER.

00:35.306 --> 00:38.038
SMALL TALK'S OVER.
 SO SHE GOT THE PERFECT LAWYER.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.211
LET'S GO.
YOU DON'T NEED HIS PERMISSION.

00:40.211 --> 00:42.613
YOU WANNA TALK TO HER,
YOU TALK TO ME FIRST.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.181
(Mary Alice)
WHEN IT CAME TO HER DIVORCE,

00:50.181 --> 00:54.355
LYNETTE SCAVO WAS DETERMINED
TO MAKE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.090
SO WHEN TOM WAS LATE
TO PICK UP THE KIDS,

00:59.090 --> 01:01.332
SHE WAITED PATIENTLY.

01:01.332 --> 01:05.666
WHEN HE GOT SOMETHING
IN THE MAIL, SHE HELD ON TO IT.

01:07.398 --> 01:10.401
AND WHEN HE LEFT BEHIND
SOMETHING IMPORTANT,

01:10.401 --> 01:13.444
SHE BROUGHT IT TO HIM.

01:13.444 --> 01:17.578
YES, AFTER YEARS OF FIGHTING
HAD LED HER NOWHERE,

01:17.578 --> 01:20.781
LYNETTE DECIDED
TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.254
LYNETTE?
 OH! HEY, GREGG.

01:23.254 --> 01:25.256
HEY. COMING BY TO SEE
THE NEW OFFICES?
 (chuckles)

01:25.256 --> 01:27.858
I BET I COULD GET THE C.E.O.
TO GIVE YOU A PRIVATE TOUR.

01:27.858 --> 01:30.121
WAIT A SECOND. I AM THE C.E.O.
I KNOW I COULD.

01:30.121 --> 01:31.622
(laughs) NO, THANKS.

01:31.622 --> 01:35.266
I'M JUST DROPPING SOMETHING OFF
THAT TOM FORGOT AT HOME.

01:35.266 --> 01:36.567
OH, WOW.

01:36.567 --> 01:38.399
MY EX WOULDN'T BRING ANYTHING
BY FOR ME UNLESS IT WAS TICKING.

01:38.399 --> 01:39.730
OH.

01:39.730 --> 01:43.434
SO... HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING
WITH YOUR SEPARATION?

01:43.434 --> 01:45.406
I'M GUESSING YOU KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT,

01:45.406 --> 01:49.109
HAVING BEEN THERE.
 YEAH, IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS SINCE
MY DIVORCE, AND IT STILL SUCKS.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.141
AH.

01:50.141 --> 01:51.842
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT NOT BE
MY PLACE TO SAY IT,

01:51.842 --> 01:54.685
BUT I THINK TOM'S NUTS
FOR LETTING YOU GO.

01:54.685 --> 01:56.647
THAT'S VERY SWEET.

01:56.647 --> 01:58.118
SO ARE YOU SEEING ANYONE?

01:58.118 --> 02:00.421
THAT'S... A LITTLE NOSEY.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.223
SORRY. I-I'M JUST SAYING,
IF YOU EVER WANTED

02:02.223 --> 02:04.555
TO HAVE A DRINK AND VENT
WITH SOMEBODY WHO GETS IT,

02:04.555 --> 02:06.897
I WOULD GLADLY BE THAT PERSON.
 OKAY.

02:06.897 --> 02:08.729
SWEET AGAIN, BUT I THINK
THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE WEIRD

02:08.729 --> 02:10.300
WITH YOU BEING TOM'S BOSS.

02:10.300 --> 02:11.662
YEAH, I GET THAT.

02:11.662 --> 02:14.905
I JUST WOULDN'T FORGIVE MYSELF
IF I DIDN'T ASK.

02:14.905 --> 02:16.907
BUT NEVER WORRY IF YOU'RE
GONNA BE OKAY, LYNETTE.

02:16.907 --> 02:19.740
YOU WILL. YOU ARE
THE EXACT KIND OF WOMAN

02:19.740 --> 02:21.742
THAT MOST MEN OUT THERE
ARE LOOKING FOR.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.174
(clicks teeth)

02:25.145 --> 02:28.179
WELL, THANKS. I-I ALWAYS
LIKED THIS PICTURE OF US.

02:28.179 --> 02:29.720
YOU'RE WELCOME.
 (chuckles)

02:29.720 --> 02:31.151
OH, HEY, I'M OFF ON FRIDAY,

02:31.151 --> 02:33.184
SO WE CAN LEAVE EARLY
FOR THE CABIN.

02:33.184 --> 02:35.286
UH, BAD NEWS. UH, I CHECKED
THE WEATHER UP THERE.

02:35.286 --> 02:36.757
IT LOOKS LIKE RAIN
FOR THIS WEEKEND.

02:36.757 --> 02:41.462
SO? I WASN'T SEEING US SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME OUTDOORS.

02:41.462 --> 02:42.633
(laughs)

02:42.633 --> 02:44.195
I THINK WE HAVE A LITTLE...

02:44.195 --> 02:46.837
"HORIZONTAL" TO CATCH UP ON.

02:46.837 --> 02:49.240
IT'S KIND OF BEEN A WHILE,
HASN'T IT?

02:49.240 --> 02:51.902
WELL, I GUESS, WITH, UH,
WORK AND EVERYTHING.

02:51.902 --> 02:54.345
A CABIN, THE RAIN...

02:54.345 --> 02:56.607
A BED.

02:56.607 --> 02:59.780
IT'S GONNA BE
A GOOD WEEKEND.

03:07.288 --> 03:10.391
YES, LYNETTE HAD TRIED HARD

03:10.391 --> 03:13.324
TO TAKE THE HIGH ROAD
IN HER DIVORCE...

03:13.324 --> 03:15.666
HEY, GREGG.

03:18.269 --> 03:20.501
THAT DRINK--
I'D ACTUALLY ENJOY THAT.

03:20.501 --> 03:23.504
BUT SOMETIMES, THE LOW ROAD
WAS EASIER TO FIND.

03:37.548 --> 03:43.424
CARLOS SOLIS WAS USED TO
SITTING IN A POSITION OF POWER,

03:43.424 --> 03:48.759
WHETHER IT WAS BEHIND THE WHEEL
OF A POWERFUL CAR...
 (starts engine)

03:48.759 --> 03:52.603
AT THE HEAD OF A POWER LUNCH...

03:53.904 --> 03:58.439
OR AT THE HELM
OF A POWERFUL COMPANY.

03:59.810 --> 04:04.315
BUT NOW THAT CARLOS SOLIS
HAD STARTED A NEW CAREER,

04:04.315 --> 04:09.380
HE SUDDENLY FOUND HIMSELF
IN A MUCH HUMBLER PLACE.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.782
SO... WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY NEW OFFICE?

04:13.724 --> 04:16.656
OKAY, I'LL ADMIT IT'S A LITTLE
BIT ON THE BARE BONES SIDE--

04:16.656 --> 04:18.389
ARE YOU KIDDING?

04:18.389 --> 04:19.829
ALL YOU NEED
IS SOME YELLOW TAPE

04:19.829 --> 04:21.332
AND A NOOSE HANGING
FROM THE CEILING,

04:21.332 --> 04:23.634
AND YOU'LL BE READY
TO ENTERTAIN.

04:23.634 --> 04:24.895
I LIKE IT, DADDY.

04:24.895 --> 04:25.996
THANK YOU, BABY.

04:25.996 --> 04:27.598
AW, THAT'S SO SWEET.

04:27.598 --> 04:30.441
YOU'RE LYING TO SPARE
YOUR DADDY'S FEELINGS.

04:30.441 --> 04:33.474
SERIOUSLY, HONEY, THERE'S A GUY
DOWN AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE

04:33.474 --> 04:36.347
WHO DRESSES ALL THE WINDOWS.
MAYBE HE COULD SPRUCE IT UP.

04:36.347 --> 04:37.508
"SPRUCE IT UP"?

04:37.508 --> 04:39.910
GABY, WE CAN BARELY
KEEP THE LIGHTS ON HERE.

04:39.910 --> 04:42.483
OUR BUDGET IS TINY,
AND EVERY CENT GOES TOWARDS

04:42.483 --> 04:44.555
HELPING ADDICTS,
FINDING THEM JOBS, HOUSING...

04:44.555 --> 04:47.388
OKAY, OKAY.
SAVE IT FOR THE PAMPHLET.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.889
ALL I'M SAYING IS,
IF I WAS AN ADDICT,

04:48.889 --> 04:51.462
ROOMS LIKE THIS ARE WHY
I SHOOT UP IN THE FIRST PLACE.

04:51.462 --> 04:54.365
OKAY, BEHAVE.
LISTEN TO YOUR DADDY.

04:54.365 --> 04:56.397
(kisses) I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

04:56.397 --> 04:57.968
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! I CAN'T
TAKE THE GIRLS TO SCHOOL.

04:57.968 --> 04:59.330
YOU ALWAYS TAKE THEM.

04:59.330 --> 05:00.631
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK EARLY
TODAY.

05:00.631 --> 05:02.533
WELL, I'M AT WORK RIGHT NOW.

05:02.533 --> 05:04.535
CARLOS, HOW MUCH DO YOU MAKE
IN AN HOUR?

05:04.535 --> 05:06.477
$12.

05:06.477 --> 05:09.380
I JUST MADE $12 LISTENING TO YOU
TELL ME YOU MAKE $12.

05:09.380 --> 05:11.642
GABY, COME ON. THIS JOB
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

05:11.642 --> 05:14.044
I'M DOING VERY MEANINGFUL WORK.
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT.

05:14.044 --> 05:16.347
WELL, WHEN WE CAN PAY
OUR MORTGAGE IN "MEANINGFUL,"

05:16.347 --> 05:17.348
I WILL BE.

05:17.348 --> 05:19.490
MWAH.

05:22.393 --> 05:24.455
HEY, BUDDY.
HOW WAS SCHOOL?

05:24.455 --> 05:28.499
OKAY. I'M STARVING.
CAN I HAVE SOME COOKIES?

05:28.499 --> 05:30.601
SURE.

05:30.601 --> 05:32.603
DIDN'T YOU LIKE
THE TURKEY SANDWICH I MADE YOU?

05:32.603 --> 05:33.734
NOT REALLY.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.506
I TRIED TO TRADE IT
TO JOHN GURRY

05:35.506 --> 05:37.037
FOR A BOOK ABOUT WORMS,

05:37.037 --> 05:39.910
BUT HE BACKED OUT 'CAUSE
YOU USED TOO MUCH MAYO.

05:39.910 --> 05:44.545
SORRY. DIDN'T REALIZE
THE WORM KID WAS SUCH A GOURMET.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.718
WHAT'S THIS?

05:47.718 --> 05:49.380
NOTHING.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.522
WAIT. YOUR SCHOOL'S HAVING
A SOAPBOX DERBY.

05:51.522 --> 05:52.383
YEAH.

05:52.383 --> 05:54.024
WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
SO MUCH FUN.

05:54.024 --> 05:57.428
IT'S FOR DADS AND SONS.

06:00.791 --> 06:05.095
YES... BUT IT DOESN'T SAY
MOMS CAN'T DO IT, TOO.

06:05.095 --> 06:07.398
THAT'S OKAY.
I DON'T HAVE TO DO IT.

06:07.398 --> 06:09.369
BESIDES, IT'S IN THREE DAYS.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.873
OH. THAT'S REALLY SOON.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.605
I GUESS WE SHOULD
GET STARTED.

06:14.605 --> 06:16.477
OH, COME ON.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.409
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MISS OUT ON ALL THE FUN.

06:18.409 --> 06:20.411
MOM, YOU CAN'T MAKE A CAR.

06:20.411 --> 06:22.683
WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

06:22.683 --> 06:25.556
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T EVEN MAKE
A TURKEY SANDWICH.

06:25.556 --> 06:29.490
WELL, THANK GOODNESS I HAVE
THE MOST TALENTED PARTNER.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.492
NOW COME ON.
WE'RE WASTING TIME.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.464
LET'S GET HAMMERING.

06:33.464 --> 06:35.466
(indistinct conversations)

06:35.466 --> 06:36.997
SERIOUSLY?
YOU'RE TELLING ME

06:36.997 --> 06:39.169
YOU'RE
AGAINST THE DEATH PENALTY?

06:39.169 --> 06:40.871
I'VE JUST SEEN
TOO MANY CASES

06:40.871 --> 06:43.534
WHERE THE WRONG PERSON
GETS CONVICTED.

06:43.534 --> 06:45.576
NOT MY CLIENTS, OF COURSE.

06:45.576 --> 06:48.138
WELL, I JUST THINK
OUR SOCIETY'S GOTTEN TOO SOFT.

06:48.138 --> 06:51.542
WE NEED A POWERFUL DETERRENT
TO STOP THESE KILLERS.

06:51.542 --> 06:52.643
YOU DO REALIZE
YOU'RE NOT ON TRIAL

06:52.643 --> 06:55.516
FOR A PARKING TICKET, RIGHT?
 (fork clatters)

06:55.516 --> 06:59.019
KIDDING. HEY, I'M JUST--
JUST TRYING TO LIGHTEN THE MOOD.

06:59.019 --> 07:02.022
TOMORROW'S GONNA BE FINE.
IT'S JUST A PRE-TRIAL HEARING.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.455
YES, WHICH BRINGS ME ONE STEP
CLOSER TO THE REAL THING.

07:04.455 --> 07:08.759
SO WHAT EXACTLY... WILL WE
BE DOING AT THIS HEARING?

07:08.759 --> 07:12.933
YOU WILL SIT THERE
AND LOOK CLASSY AND INNOCENT.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.966
I WILL TRY TO GET AS MUCH
OF THEIR CASE TOSSED AS I CAN.

07:15.966 --> 07:18.639
AND YOUR SUCCESS RATE
AT THIS SORT OF THING IS?

07:18.639 --> 07:20.971
IMPRESSIVE.

07:20.971 --> 07:23.844
I ONCE DEFENDED A WOMAN
WHO RAN A BROTHEL.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.547
AT THE PRE-TRIAL,
I GOT THE WHOLE THING REDUCED

07:26.547 --> 07:29.980
TO OPERATING A BUSINESS
WITHOUT A FIRE DOOR.

07:29.980 --> 07:31.081
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

07:31.081 --> 07:33.584
WHAT? WHAT, ME BEING
A GREAT LAWYER?

07:33.584 --> 07:35.756
NO, DEFENDING A PROSTITUTE.
CALL ME OLD-FASHIONED,

07:35.756 --> 07:38.729
BUT I FIND THAT LINE OF WORK
RATHER DISTASTEFUL.

07:38.729 --> 07:40.561
(chuckles) SO--SO IF SHE RAN
A CIGARETTE COMPANY,

07:40.561 --> 07:43.534
OR MANUFACTURED HANDGUNS,
SHE'S A-OK,

07:43.534 --> 07:45.035
BUT--BUT SELLING MEN
A LITTLE RING-A-DING

07:45.035 --> 07:46.567
MAKES HER A PARIAH.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.940
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
"RING-A-DING"?
 MM-HMM.

07:49.940 --> 07:53.173
SECOND, SEX, ISN'T A COMMODITY.
IT'S... SACRED.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.605
YEAH, I'LL SAY,
AND FOR THIS WOMAN,

07:54.605 --> 07:56.877
SACRED COST 400 BUCKS A POP.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.179
CAN WE PLEASE STOP TALKING
ABOUT IT? IT'S TAWDRY.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.782
(chuckles)
 AND THAT LITTLE CRACK
ABOUT MANUFACTURING HANDGUNS?

08:01.782 --> 08:04.615
I HOPE THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE ANTI-GUN.

08:04.615 --> 08:06.186
I'VE SUED THE N.R.A.
THREE TIMES.

08:06.186 --> 08:10.090
IT IS MY DREAM TO ONE DAY
TAKE THOSE SONS OF BITCHES DOWN.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.663
WELL, WHEN IT COMES TO MY GUNS,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PRY THEM

08:12.663 --> 08:14.865
OUT OF MY COLD, DEAD HANDS.

08:14.865 --> 08:18.569
"GUNS"? PLURAL?
 MM-HMM.

08:18.569 --> 08:20.901
WHAT, IS THAT SO YOU CAN, UH,
COORDINATE YOUR FIREARMS

08:20.901 --> 08:22.933
WITH YOUR SHOES?

08:22.933 --> 08:25.636
YOU AND I ARE NEVER GONNA
AGREE ON ANYTHING, ARE WE?

08:25.636 --> 08:28.909
(crunches)
THIS SALAD KIND OF SUCKS.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.681
I AGREE.

08:30.681 --> 08:34.715
NOT WITH THE LANGUAGE,
BUT WITH THE OBSERVATION.

08:36.046 --> 08:37.748
I HAVE NEVER MET ANYONE

08:37.748 --> 08:40.049
WHO CAN PULL OFF A CAPE
LIKE YOU, MRS. DUNCAN.

08:40.049 --> 08:41.291
AND THIS IS OUR LAST ONE,

08:41.291 --> 08:42.953
SO I'M NOT LETTING YOU
LEAVE HERE WITHOUT IT.

08:42.953 --> 08:44.955
(chuckles)

08:46.797 --> 08:50.801
UH-OH. ANOTHER STRAY FROM
THE LAND OF ELASTIC WAISTBANDS.

08:50.801 --> 08:53.033
AVERT YOUR EYES.
I'LL GET RID OF HER.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.705
HELLO, DEAR.

08:54.705 --> 08:56.607
YOU MUST HAVE TAKEN
A WRONG TURN.

08:56.607 --> 08:58.739
SENSIBLE SHOES
ARE ONE FLOOR DOWN.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.941
OH, ACTUALLY, I'M LOOKING
FOR A PERSONAL SHOPPER.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.242
I NEED HELP.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.676
OKAY. UM...

09:10.681 --> 09:11.722
YOU'RE WELCOME.

09:11.722 --> 09:13.624
OH.

09:13.624 --> 09:15.756
OH, CHAMPAGNE. OH--

09:15.756 --> 09:18.158
OH, NO, NO. THIS IS JUST
FOR HIGH-END CUSTOMERS.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.189
OH. (chuckles)

09:19.189 --> 09:20.761
AND ME. MY HUSBAND'S
AN ALCOHOLIC.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.963
SO I CAN ONLY DRINK
AT WORK.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.335
I'M LOOKING TO FRESHEN UP
MY WARDROBE.

09:25.335 --> 09:28.568
I HAVEN'T BOUGHT NEW CLOTHES
IN QUITE SOME TIME.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.801
I UNDERSTAND. FIXED INCOME?

09:30.801 --> 09:34.675
NO. MY RICH HUSBAND WAS
A STINGY SON OF A BITCH,

09:34.675 --> 09:39.780
AND NOW HE'S TOES UP.
I AM READY TO SPEND.

09:39.780 --> 09:40.851
WHO WAS YOUR HUSBAND?

09:40.851 --> 09:42.252
WILLIAM HAMMOND.

09:42.252 --> 09:43.984
AS IN THE HAMMOND THEATER?
 MM-HMM.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.085
AND THE HAMMOND HOSPITAL?
 YEP.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.257
AND THE HAMMOND LIBRARY?

09:47.257 --> 09:49.620
SO YOU'VE HEARD OF HIM.
 ARE YOU KIDDING?

09:49.620 --> 09:50.691
I'VE BEEN TO SHOWS
IN THAT THEATER,

09:50.691 --> 09:52.192
I'VE GIVEN BIRTH
IN THAT HOSPITAL,

09:52.192 --> 09:55.065
AND I WENT INTO THAT LIBRARY
ONCE FOR DIRECTIONS.

09:55.065 --> 09:56.767
OH.
 WELL, SIT DOWN

09:56.767 --> 09:57.928
WHILE I PULL YOU
SOME CLOTHES.

09:57.928 --> 10:00.030
OH. (chuckles)
 THERE YOU GO.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.071
WELL, THANK YOU.

10:01.071 --> 10:03.373
OH, HONEY.
LOOK AT THAT CAPE.

10:04.705 --> 10:05.706
THAT LOOKS INTERESTING.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.237
OH.

10:07.237 --> 10:11.041
GIVE ME THAT.
YOU LOOK LIKE BATMAN.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.282
OH. (chuckles)

10:12.282 --> 10:14.214
THERE YOU GO.

10:14.214 --> 10:19.920
AND FOR THE RECEPTION,
I WAS THINKING OF A JAZZ BAND.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.291
WOULDN'T THAT BE COOL?

10:21.291 --> 10:23.724
EH, I LIKE JAZZ.
UH, BUT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED

10:23.724 --> 10:26.326
IN A LITTLE, UH,
TRADITIONAL AUSTRALIAN MUSIC,

10:26.326 --> 10:29.129
I KNOW THIS GUY WHO PLAYS
A BADASS DIDGERIDOO.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.833
JAZZ IT IS.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.805
OKAY, WE'VE DONE ENOUGH.

10:34.805 --> 10:37.768
LET ME CLEAN THIS UP,
AND THEN WE CAN GO UPSTAIRS

10:37.768 --> 10:40.310
FOR A PREVIEW
OF OUR WEDDING NIGHT.

10:40.310 --> 10:42.813
OH, NOW YOU'RE TALKING.
I'LL GRAB SOME WINE.

10:42.813 --> 10:44.815
I KNOW THIS MIGHT SURPRISE YOU,

10:44.815 --> 10:47.678
BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE A FEW MOVES
SAVED UP

10:47.678 --> 10:50.721
FOR MY FIRST NIGHT
AS MRS. BEN FAULKNER.

10:50.721 --> 10:52.683
UH... IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

10:52.683 --> 10:56.126
I JUST... CAN'T IMAGINE...
WHAT'S LEFT.

10:56.126 --> 10:59.089
(bottle clatters)
 OH, YEAH, THAT'S JUST SOME,
UH, SOME BUSINESS STUFF

10:59.089 --> 11:03.333
THAT I NEED TO TAKE.
 NO, IT'S A SUBPOENA.

11:03.333 --> 11:07.237
YOU'RE ON THE WITNESS LIST
FOR BREE'S TRIAL? WHY?

11:07.237 --> 11:10.070
UH, BEATS ME. I-I TH-THINK
THEY MADE A MISTAKE.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.903
KIND OF A COINCIDENCE,
THOUGH.

11:12.903 --> 11:15.045
WELL...
 THE COPS QUESTIONING YOU

11:15.045 --> 11:16.406
ABOUT THAT BODY
THEY FOUND ON SITE

11:16.406 --> 11:19.810
AND THEN BREE GETTING ARRESTED
FOR KILLING THE GUY?

11:21.912 --> 11:23.413
BEN, DON'T LIE TO ME.

11:23.413 --> 11:25.455
I CAN HANDLE ANYTHING
YOU TELL ME,

11:25.455 --> 11:27.788
JUST AS LONG AS
IT'S THE TRUTH.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.420
UM... OKAY.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.763
LISTEN, RENEE,
LET'S JUST DROP THIS, OKAY?

11:32.763 --> 11:34.965
NO. I'M ABOUT TO BECOME
YOUR WIFE.

11:34.965 --> 11:36.867
YOU WANNA KEEP A SECRET

11:36.867 --> 11:40.030
ABOUT TOUCHING ANOTHER BOY'S
DIDGERIDOO AT SUMMER CAMP, FINE.

11:40.030 --> 11:41.371
BUT NOT ABOUT A MURDER.

11:43.774 --> 11:47.207
HOLY CRAP.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.179
I'M RIGHT.

11:49.179 --> 11:52.712
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON, OR I'M
WALKING OUT OF THIS HOUSE.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.484
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO LET ME
THINK ABOUT IT.

11:56.947 --> 11:59.019
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

11:59.019 --> 12:03.093
MY, UH, MY FIRST HUSBAND
KEPT SECRETS FROM ME,

12:03.093 --> 12:06.226
AND IT ENDED OUR MARRIAGE.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.429
I'M NOT GOING DOWN
THIS ROAD AGAIN.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.508
GABY,
WHY IS THERE AN OLD LADY

12:18.508 --> 12:20.941
SITTING AT
OUR DINING ROOM TABLE?

12:20.941 --> 12:23.013
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO THAT IS?

12:23.013 --> 12:25.175
I THINK MY GENERIC REFERENCE
TO HER AS "OLD LADY"

12:25.175 --> 12:26.416
KINDA SAYS I DON'T.

12:26.416 --> 12:29.019
SHE'S DORIS HAMMOND,
AS IN HAMMOND INVESTMENTS.

12:29.019 --> 12:30.450
RING ANY BELLS?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.522
BILL HAMMOND'S WIDOW?

12:32.522 --> 12:34.024
GUY MADE A KILLING
IN PRIVATE EQUITY.

12:34.024 --> 12:35.455
WHY IS SHE HERE?

12:35.455 --> 12:38.028
SHE'S MY BEST CUSTOMER
DOWN AT CUMBERLY'S,

12:38.028 --> 12:39.429
I THINK MOSTLY 'CAUSE
SHE SEES ME AS HER FRIEND.

12:39.429 --> 12:42.893
(chuckles) OH. SO YOU THOUGHT
YOU'D EXPLOIT THAT--

12:42.893 --> 12:45.335
INVITE A LONELY WIDOW TO DINNER,
PRETEND SHE'S YOUR FRIEND,

12:45.335 --> 12:46.496
JUST TO MAKE MONEY
OFF OF HER.

12:46.496 --> 12:48.338
(oven door clatters)
 EXACTLY.

12:48.338 --> 12:49.970
GABY, CAN'T I JUST TAKE
MY PLATE UPSTAIRS?

12:49.970 --> 12:51.371
I'M EXHAUSTED.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.844
YOU'RE EXHAUSTED? I HAD TO WATCH
A 20-MINUTE iPhone VIDEO

12:53.844 --> 12:55.775
OF HER CAT TAKING A NAP
IN A LAUNDRY BASKET

12:55.775 --> 12:57.147
JUST TO SELL HER A COAT.

12:57.147 --> 12:58.909
NOW GET OUT THERE,
LOSE YOUR TOP BUTTON,

12:58.909 --> 13:00.450
AND LOOK PRETTY.

13:03.353 --> 13:07.257
DORIS, I CAN'T GET OVER HOW
LOVELY THAT JACKET LOOKS ON YOU.

13:07.257 --> 13:10.290
ISN'T IT LOVELY, CARLOS?

13:10.290 --> 13:13.223
YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

13:13.223 --> 13:17.027
OH, I ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK
WHEN I SAW THE PRICE.

13:17.027 --> 13:18.528
I GUESS I JUST HAVE
TO GET COMFORTABLE

13:18.528 --> 13:20.530
WITH THE IDEA
OF SPENDING MONEY.

13:20.530 --> 13:23.103
THAT'S RIGHT, AND TOMORROW
WHEN THE NEW FALL LINE COMES IN,

13:23.103 --> 13:25.005
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
 REAL COMFORTABLE.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.376
(chuckles)

13:26.376 --> 13:28.238
SO, CARLOS...

13:28.238 --> 13:29.910
WHAT IS IT YOU DO?

13:29.910 --> 13:34.484
I... WORK FOR A NONPROFIT
THAT HELPS RECOVERING ADDICTS.

13:34.484 --> 13:39.119
(imitates loud snoring)

13:39.119 --> 13:43.223
OH, I'M SORRY. WAS CARLOS
TALKING ABOUT HIS CHARITY?

13:43.223 --> 13:45.395
GOOD THING WE WEREN'T OPERATING
HEAVY MACHINERY, HUH, DORIS?

13:45.395 --> 13:46.426
(chuckles)

13:46.426 --> 13:48.498
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE
MY WIFE.

13:48.498 --> 13:51.301
NOT THE BIGGEST FAN
OF WHAT I DO.

13:51.301 --> 13:52.863
OH, THAT'S SILLY.

13:52.863 --> 13:55.936
PHILANTHROPY IS VERY IMPORTANT.

13:55.936 --> 13:59.339
MY BILL GAVE GENEROUSLY
TO MANY WORTHY CAUSES.

14:01.171 --> 14:02.442
OKAY, IF WE'RE GONNA KEEP
TALKING ABOUT CHARITY,

14:02.442 --> 14:04.945
I'LL MAKE COFFEE.
WE'RE GONNA NEED IT.

14:08.278 --> 14:10.480
BOY, BILL LEFT
QUITE A LEGACY.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.522
HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT
ABOUT CARRYING THAT ON?

14:12.522 --> 14:17.087
OH, I'D LOVE TO, BUT I WOULDN'T
KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN.

14:17.087 --> 14:20.931
MAYBE I COULD HELP.

14:20.931 --> 14:23.533
SO MY EX'S LAWYER SAYS,
"WE BELIEVE IT'S FAIR

14:23.533 --> 14:26.596
FOR MR. LIMON TO PAY
AN ADDITIONAL $1 MILLION."

14:26.596 --> 14:29.139
AND I SAID--AND THIS IS
HOW MY MOUTH

14:29.139 --> 14:32.472
ALWAYS GETS ME IN TROUBLE--
"SO THAT COMES OUT TO WHAT,

14:32.472 --> 14:34.444
ABOUT $1 A POUND"?

14:34.444 --> 14:38.548
(gasps) OH, MAN.
AND THE JUDGE...

14:38.548 --> 14:40.510
NOT AMUSED, WHICH IS WHY
I WOUND UP PAYING

14:40.510 --> 14:43.113
AN ADDITIONAL $2 MILLION.

14:43.113 --> 14:47.887
OHH. TOM AND I ARE GOING TO
TRY TO DO THIS WITHOUT LAWYERS.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.259
HUH.

14:49.259 --> 14:50.420
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, "HUH"?

14:50.420 --> 14:51.621
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
25 YEARS.

14:51.621 --> 14:53.493
WE HAVE KIDS TOGETHER.
 AND THAT'S GREAT.

14:53.493 --> 14:57.097
IT'S ALL GREAT, BUT THERE IS
ANOTHER PERSON INVOLVED.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.498
JANE.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.001
AND TRUST ME, SHE IS GONNA BE
IN HIS EAR THE WHOLE TIME

15:01.001 --> 15:02.302
ABOUT THE SETTLEMENT.

15:02.302 --> 15:06.076
BY THE WAY, I DO NOT
 GET THE ATTRACTION THERE.

15:06.076 --> 15:07.978
WELL, LET'S SAVE THAT TOPIC
FOR ANOTHER NIGHT.

15:07.978 --> 15:09.539
WE CAN DO HOURS
ON THAT ONE.

15:09.539 --> 15:13.143
ANOTHER NIGHT?
SO THIS IS GOING PRETTY GOOD.
 YEAH. IT'S BEEN GREAT.

15:13.143 --> 15:15.445
WELL, OKAY,
WE SHOULD DO IT AGAIN.

15:15.445 --> 15:16.987
HOW ABOUT SATURDAY NIGHT?

15:16.987 --> 15:20.951
(chuckles)
THIS SATURDAY'S BAD.

15:20.951 --> 15:22.192
TOM NEEDS ME
TO SWITCH WEEKENDS

15:22.192 --> 15:25.925
BECAUSE HE'S GOING AWAY
WITH... JANE.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.598
WELL... (sighs)
IT'D BE KIND OF A SHAME

15:28.598 --> 15:31.561
IF SOME LAST-MINUTE STUFF
CAME UP AT WORK,

15:31.561 --> 15:33.333
AND HE WASN'T ABLE TO GO.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.464
(laughs) YEAH.
 I GUESS THAT WOULD MEAN

15:34.464 --> 15:35.705
HE WOULDN'T HAVE
TO SWITCH WEEKENDS,

15:35.705 --> 15:39.109
AND THAT WOULD FREE YOU UP
FOR SATURDAY.

15:39.109 --> 15:41.441
DID I GET THAT CALCULUS
RIGHT?

15:41.441 --> 15:44.614
ARE YOU SAYING IN ORDER
TO GET A DATE WITH ME,

15:44.614 --> 15:46.246
YOU'D MESS WITH TOM?

15:46.246 --> 15:48.378
DON'T THINK OF IT SO MUCH
AS MESSING WITH TOM.

15:48.378 --> 15:50.520
THINK OF IT MORE
AS MESSING WITH...

15:50.520 --> 15:53.523
JANE.
 (deep voice) JANE.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.059
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S STAYING TOGETHER. (laughs)

15:59.059 --> 16:00.330
HOW LONG IS THIS RACE?

16:00.330 --> 16:02.532
THREE MINUTES.
 THREE MINUTES!

16:02.532 --> 16:04.664
THIS CAN TOTALLY STAY TOGETHER
FOR THREE MINUTES.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.966
CAN I GO NOW?
 OH.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.598
I WAS GONNA HAVE YOU
HELP ME PUT ON THE WHEELS.

16:08.598 --> 16:10.600
NO, THANKS.
JUANITA FOUND A DEAD SQUIRREL,

16:10.600 --> 16:12.502
SO I KINDA WANNA
CHECK IT OUT.

16:12.502 --> 16:15.075
UH...

16:15.075 --> 16:16.246
WELL, OF COURSE.

16:16.246 --> 16:17.607
GOTTA SEE
THE DEAD SQUIRREL.

16:17.607 --> 16:20.980
ONLY TOUCH IT
WITH A STICK!

16:20.980 --> 16:23.213
NO FINGERS!

16:23.213 --> 16:25.685
BLOWN OFF
FOR A DEAD SQUIRREL?

16:25.685 --> 16:28.518
BOY, DOES THAT BRING BACK
MEMORIES.
 (tape rips)

16:28.518 --> 16:30.490
NEW HOBBY?

16:30.490 --> 16:33.993
OH, M.J. AND I ARE BUILDING
THIS SOAPBOX THINGY CAR

16:33.993 --> 16:35.625
FOR THE SCHOOL'S BIG RACE.

16:35.625 --> 16:38.528
YOU SHOULD GET TOM TO HELP.
HE DID IT WITH ALL OUR BOYS.

16:38.528 --> 16:40.530
IT'S HOW THEY LEARNED
TO SWEAR.

16:40.530 --> 16:42.632
OH. THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

16:42.632 --> 16:44.574
I AM TELLING YOU,
HE LOVES THIS STUFF.

16:44.574 --> 16:46.336
I'M GONNA GIVE HIM
A CALL.

16:46.336 --> 16:48.608
OH, THANKS, BUT I REALLY
THINK IT'S BETTER

16:48.608 --> 16:49.609
IF I DO IT MYSELF.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.141
BUT TOM CAN JUST...
 (snaps fingers)

16:51.141 --> 16:54.584
TOM IS NOT... GONNA BE
AROUND ALL THE TIME.

16:57.747 --> 17:00.019
I'M SORRY. I MEAN,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.122
I DO.
SINCE TOM AND I SPLIT,

17:02.122 --> 17:05.795
I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO BE BOTH MOM AND DAD,

17:05.795 --> 17:08.758
BUT I ALSO KNOW
IT'S OKAY TO ASK FOR HELP.

17:08.758 --> 17:12.662
NO. (sighs) I CAN DO THIS.
I HAVE TO.

17:12.662 --> 17:16.636
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK
IT'S GONNA TURN OUT GREAT.

17:16.636 --> 17:20.109
(clatters)

17:25.115 --> 17:28.078
(mouthing words)

17:28.078 --> 17:30.420
DO YOU ALWAYS MOVE YOUR LIPS
WHEN YOU READ?

17:30.420 --> 17:31.421
DO YOU ALWAYS
COMMENT ON EVERYTHING

17:31.421 --> 17:32.652
THAT BUGS YOU ABOUT ME?

17:32.652 --> 17:34.524
I HAVEN'T SAID A WORD
ABOUT YOUR TIE.

17:34.524 --> 17:39.829
OKAY, WE'RE HERE FOR DISCOVERY,
COMPLIANCE, AND TRIAL SETTING.

17:39.829 --> 17:42.632
MS. STONE, MR. WESTON,
YOU'VE EXCHANGED WITNESS LISTS?

17:42.632 --> 17:45.565
THE PEOPLE HAVE NO OBJECTION
TO MR. WESTON'S LIST.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.697
MR. WESTON, ANY OBJECTIONS?

17:47.697 --> 17:49.099
THAT DEPENDS.

17:49.099 --> 17:52.602
WHO ARE THE GENTLEMEN
FROM NUMBER 16 TO 28?

17:52.602 --> 17:54.604
I'VE NEVER HEARD
THESE NAMES BEFORE.

17:54.604 --> 17:56.346
YOUR CLIENT HAS.

17:56.346 --> 17:57.707
THEY'RE MEN SHE MET AT A BAR,
BROUGHT HOME,

17:57.707 --> 17:59.579
AND HAD SEX WITH.

17:59.579 --> 18:03.183
(laughs) THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

18:03.183 --> 18:06.116
YOUR HONOR, THE DEFENSE
WILL ARGUE THAT THERE'S

18:06.116 --> 18:07.817
NO SUGGESTION OF A RELATIONSHIP

18:07.817 --> 18:09.489
BETWEEN MS. VAN DE KAMP
AND MR. SANCHEZ,

18:09.489 --> 18:11.191
THAT SHE NEVER EVEN MET HIM.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.723
BECAUSE SHE HADN'T.
 SOME OF THESE MEN
WILL TESTIFY

18:13.723 --> 18:16.696
THAT SHE WAS SO INTOXICATED
DURING THEIR TIME TOGETHER,

18:16.696 --> 18:19.699
THAT SHE DIDN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ABOUT THE LIAISON.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.702
SUGGESTING THAT SHE COULD HAVE
SLEPT WITH MR. SANCHEZ.

18:24.574 --> 18:29.209
SO UNDER MS. STONE'S
"FORGETFUL SLUT" THEORY,

18:29.209 --> 18:32.712
YOU CAN CONNECT MY CLIENT
TO ANY MAN IN FAIRVIEW.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.284
WELL, NOT EVERY MAN IN FAIRVIEW
ENDED UP

18:34.284 --> 18:36.786
WITH THE DEFENDANT'S FINGERPRINT
ON HIS SHIRT,

18:36.786 --> 18:38.548
BUT MR. SANCHEZ DID.

18:40.550 --> 18:43.653
YOUR HONOR,
THE IDEA THAT MY CLIENT

18:43.653 --> 18:46.626
WOULD CONDUCT HERSELF IN--
IN THAT MANNER IS ABSURD.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.729
SHE IS A PARAGON OF VIRTUE
IN THE COMMUNITY,

18:49.729 --> 18:52.202
A CHAMPION
OF CONSERVATIVE VALUES...

18:57.537 --> 18:59.339
SHORT RECESS, YOUR HONOR?

18:59.339 --> 19:02.872
BREE...

19:02.872 --> 19:06.176
BREE, IS THIS TRUE? DID YOU
SLEEP WITH RAMON SANCHEZ?

19:06.176 --> 19:07.517
NO.

19:07.517 --> 19:09.679
BUT THE OTHER MEN?

19:11.681 --> 19:14.554
HOW THE HELL COULD YOU
NOT TELL ME THIS?

19:16.626 --> 19:18.428
OH, ALL RIGHT, OKAY. THIS...

19:18.428 --> 19:21.561
THIS IS OKAY AS LONG AS WE CAN
STAY IN FRONT OF IT.

19:21.561 --> 19:26.836
UM... I NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY
WHO YOU SLEPT WITH AND WHEN--

19:26.836 --> 19:30.670
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
(whispers) NO.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.702
BREE, IF I'M GOING
TO DEFEND YOU,

19:32.702 --> 19:34.204
I NEED TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

19:34.204 --> 19:38.548
I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T
TALK ABOUT THIS WITH YOU.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.812
(sighs)

19:47.787 --> 19:49.389
(Doris) GABY?

19:49.389 --> 19:52.292
DORIS, YOU WON'T BELIEVE
WHAT JUST GOT OFF THE PLANE.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.664
THE MOST BEAUTIFULLY
EMBROIDERED CHINESE SILK,

19:54.664 --> 19:56.396
AND IF YOU LISTEN TO IT
CAREFULLY,

19:56.396 --> 19:58.898
YOU CAN HEAR LITTLE CHILDREN
ASKING, "WHEN'S DINNER?"

19:58.898 --> 20:01.231
OH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE.

20:01.231 --> 20:03.573
OKAY, A LITTLE INSENSITIVE.
MY BAD.

20:03.573 --> 20:05.735
NO, I-I'VE HAD
A CHANGE OF HEART,

20:05.735 --> 20:07.877
AND I CAN'T BUY
ANYTHING MORE FROM YOU.

20:07.877 --> 20:10.510
IN FACT,
I NEED TO RETURN THESE.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.842
WHAT? YOU CAN'T.
I WORK ON COMMISSION.

20:12.842 --> 20:15.445
I-I MEAN,
YOU LOVE THESE CLOTHES.

20:15.445 --> 20:17.647
DID YOU KNOW THAT ONE
OF THESE SCARVES

20:17.647 --> 20:19.689
COULD BUY A MONTH
OF VOCATIONAL TRAINING

20:19.689 --> 20:21.691
FOR A HOMELESS ADDICT?

20:21.691 --> 20:24.994
NO, BUT THAT SOUNDS
AWFULLY FAMILIAR.

20:24.994 --> 20:27.727
IT WAS IN THE PAMPHLET THAT
CARLOS SLIPPED ME LAST NIGHT.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.399
HE DID WHAT NOW?

20:29.399 --> 20:30.900
AND WE TALKED ON THE PHONE
THIS MORNING,

20:30.900 --> 20:34.604
AND HE REMINDED ME OF WHAT
MY HUSBAND USED TO SAY--

20:34.604 --> 20:37.537
THAT "THOSE WHO DO WELL
MUST ALSO DO GOOD."

20:37.537 --> 20:39.569
MM-HMM.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE CARLOS.

20:39.569 --> 20:43.543
HE'S A VERY SPECIAL GUY.

20:43.543 --> 20:44.774
HOLD ON TO HIM.

20:45.975 --> 20:47.777
(chuckles) WELL,
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

20:47.777 --> 20:50.280
I CAN'T WAIT TO GET
MY HANDS ON HIM.
 (bag rustles)

20:50.280 --> 20:51.951
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH
COMMISSION I STOOD TO MAKE

20:51.951 --> 20:53.953
FROM THIS LADY?
 GABY.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.855
DORIS WAS MY GOLDEN GOOSE.
I WAS FATTENING HER UP,

20:55.855 --> 20:58.488
AND THEN YOU WENT
AND STOLE ALL HER EGGS,

20:58.488 --> 21:00.860
AND--AND, WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THIS METAPHOR IS GOING,

21:00.860 --> 21:03.333
BUT I AM MAD AT YOU, MISTER.
 GABY. (chuckles)

21:03.333 --> 21:05.795
NO, STOP "GABY"-ING ME.
I WILL NOT BE "GABY"-ED.

21:05.795 --> 21:08.898
LOOK, WHERE DORIS PUTS
HER MONEY IS HER DECISION.

21:08.898 --> 21:12.001
TOMORROW MORNING, 9:00,
SHE'S PUTTING IT HERE.

21:12.001 --> 21:14.744
(scoffs) OKAY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO SMUG

21:14.744 --> 21:16.876
JUST 'CAUSE YOU'RE
"DOING CHARITY."

21:16.876 --> 21:20.680
NO QUOTATION MARKS.
I'M ACTUALLY DOING CHARITY,

21:20.680 --> 21:22.512
HELPING PEOPLE
GET THEIR LIVES TOGETHER.

21:22.512 --> 21:23.913
AND I'M HELPING PEOPLE
PUT THEIR WARDROBES TOGETHER.

21:23.913 --> 21:25.715
POTATO, POTAHTO.

21:25.715 --> 21:27.687
I GOT TO RUN TO A MEETING.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.319
NOW? WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN ARGUMENT.

21:29.319 --> 21:30.890
YEAH, BUT IT'S NO FUN TO ARGUE
WHEN ONLY ONE SIDE

21:30.890 --> 21:32.392
IS MORALLY DEFENSIBLE.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.864
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS FUN?
A LITTLE VICTORY DANCE.

21:34.864 --> 21:37.667
(imitates dance beat)

21:37.667 --> 21:38.928
OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.

21:38.928 --> 21:40.299
(slap)

21:41.831 --> 21:43.403
(sighs)

21:47.607 --> 21:48.808
OKAY, IT TOOK ME ALL NIGHT,

21:48.808 --> 21:50.810
AND I SCRAPED OFF
TWO OF MY KNUCKLES,

21:50.810 --> 21:52.382
AND I DRANK
SO MUCH GREEN TEA

21:52.382 --> 21:53.883
THAT ONE OF MY EYES
WON'T STOP TWITCHING,

21:53.883 --> 21:58.888
BUT... IT'S... FINISHED.
(squeals)

21:58.888 --> 22:00.750
WHOO!

22:02.822 --> 22:03.923
(laughs)

22:03.923 --> 22:06.856
OKAY.
BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,

22:06.856 --> 22:08.658
I DESIGNED
THE FLAME DECALS MYSELF,

22:08.658 --> 22:11.060
SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM,
THEY'RE TOTALLY REMOVABLE.

22:11.060 --> 22:13.833
BUT PERSONALLY, I LIKE THEM.
I THINK THEY'RE AWESOME.

22:13.833 --> 22:17.907
AND THERE'S A BASKET ON THE BACK
FOR SUNDRIES OR SNACKS

22:17.907 --> 22:21.010
OR THUMB TACKS TO THROW
UNDER THE COMPETITION'S TIRES.

22:21.010 --> 22:23.543
BUT WHY WOULD YOU NEED TO CHEAT
WITH A CAR LIKE THIS, RIGHT?

22:23.543 --> 22:24.944
(chuckles)

22:24.944 --> 22:26.976
ARE YOU GONNA SAY SOMETHING?

22:26.976 --> 22:28.778
OH, I GET IT.

22:28.778 --> 22:30.349
YOU HATE THE BASKET.
GUESS WHAT.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.952
BASKET GONE.
 (clang)

22:34.784 --> 22:37.687
OH, COME ON. I'VE BEEN DOING
THIS FOR TWO DAYS STRAIGHT.

22:37.687 --> 22:38.888
YOU GOTTA GIVE ME SOMETHING.

22:39.889 --> 22:42.492
I... LOVE IT.

22:42.492 --> 22:44.664
YOU DO? OH!

22:44.664 --> 22:46.996
HEE HEE!
I MEAN, OF COURSE YOU DO.

22:46.996 --> 22:50.570
BUT SERIOUSLY, IF YOU HAVE
ANY THOUGHTS OR TWEAKS, TELL ME.

22:50.570 --> 22:51.941
'CAUSE WE STILL HAVE
A DAY BEFORE THE RACE.

22:51.941 --> 22:53.873
NO, NO, IT'S PERFECT.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.745
OH, I'M SO RELIEVED.

22:55.745 --> 22:58.007
YOU WANNA TAKE IT
FOR A SPIN?

22:58.007 --> 23:00.109
YEAH, BUT...
I'M KIND OF THIRSTY.

23:00.109 --> 23:02.051
CAN YOU GET ME SOMETHING
TO DRINK?

23:02.051 --> 23:05.755
OF COURSE. TWO FROSTY
NON-CAFFEINATED ROOT BEERS

23:05.755 --> 23:07.617
COMING RIGHT UP.

23:18.027 --> 23:20.430
(brakes squeal)

23:20.430 --> 23:24.073
OH! OH, MY GOD!
WHAT DID YOU DO?

23:24.073 --> 23:25.975
I DIDN'T SEE IT COMING.
I'M SO SORRY.

23:25.975 --> 23:30.980
NO, NOT YOU! MY SON!
YOU CAN GO. OH.

23:30.980 --> 23:32.141
(truck door closes)

23:32.141 --> 23:36.886
(truck departs)
 M.J., DID YOU WRECK THE CAR
ON PURPOSE?

23:36.886 --> 23:40.920
NO. IT JUST ROLLED
DOWN THE DRIVEWAY.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.994
IT'S A FLAT DRIVEWAY.

23:44.994 --> 23:47.096
OKAY, I DID IT.

23:47.096 --> 23:49.999
(sighs deeply)

23:49.999 --> 23:51.160
(wood clatters)
 WHY?

23:51.160 --> 23:53.002
I HATE THAT CAR.

23:53.002 --> 23:55.034
WELL, THEN WE'LL CHANGE IT.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.106
WE'LL MAKE IT
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO.

23:57.106 --> 23:59.969
I DON'T WANNA DO IT.
I DON'T WANNA BE THE WEIRDO.

23:59.969 --> 24:04.173
HONEY, DID SOMEONE CALL YOU
A WEIRDO?

24:04.173 --> 24:06.616
THEY DON'T HAVE TO.
THEY'RE ALWAYS STARING AT ME

24:06.616 --> 24:09.679
AND TREATING ME DIFFERENT
'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE A DAD.

24:09.679 --> 24:11.751
OH, HONEY.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.883
AND IF I GO
TO THE FATHER-SON DERBY,

24:13.883 --> 24:15.885
AND I'M THE ONLY KID
WITH HIS MOM,

24:15.885 --> 24:17.857
IT'S GONNA BE EVEN WORSE.

24:17.857 --> 24:21.591
I'M SO SORRY.
I HAD NO IDEA.

24:21.591 --> 24:23.092
WHAT CAN I DO
TO MAKE IT BETTER?

24:23.092 --> 24:27.236
NOTHING.
I JUST WANT DAD.

24:30.700 --> 24:31.971
(sighs)

24:37.777 --> 24:38.808
HEY!

24:38.808 --> 24:41.050
HEY! HOW WAS SOCCER?

24:41.050 --> 24:42.682
AWESOME. I THINK WE'RE GONNA

24:42.682 --> 24:44.954
KICK SAN MARINO'S ASS
ON SATURDAY.
 (door closes)

24:44.954 --> 24:46.856
NICE. YOU WANT ME TO MAKE YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT?

24:46.856 --> 24:48.688
THANKS.
I'M GONNA GET CHANGED.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.119
HEY.
 HEY.

24:50.119 --> 24:51.661
IT'S CUTE HOW HER GENERATION

24:51.661 --> 24:53.893
THINKS THAT SPORT
IS INTERESTING.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.565
UGH.

24:55.565 --> 24:56.966
OH, AND, UM, I WILL BRING HER
TO THE GAME SATURDAY.

24:56.966 --> 24:59.228
LOOKS LIKE WE WON'T NEED
TO SWITCH WEEKENDS.

24:59.228 --> 25:02.672
I THOUGHT YOU AND JANE
WERE GOING AWAY.

25:02.672 --> 25:05.134
CAN'T. I GOT TO WORK.

25:05.134 --> 25:07.036
GREGG WANTS ME TO REWORK
THE STRATEGIC PLAN

25:07.036 --> 25:09.739
THE INTERNATIONAL GUYS DID,
SO...

25:09.739 --> 25:10.940
HUH. WELL, THAT SUCKS.

25:10.940 --> 25:12.241
NEVER LIKED THAT GUY.

25:12.241 --> 25:15.084
THEN WHY'D YOU GO OUT
WITH HIM?

25:15.084 --> 25:16.746
(packaging rustles)

25:16.746 --> 25:19.018
I MEAN, HE SAID YOU GUYS
HAD DRINKS THE OTHER NIGHT?

25:19.018 --> 25:23.052
IT WAS NOTHING.
 WE JUST, YOU KNOW...

25:23.052 --> 25:25.024
HUNG OUT FOR A BIT.
 (silverware clatters)

25:25.024 --> 25:29.799
YOU DO REALIZE THAT
THAT COULD BE AWKWARD FOR ME.

25:29.799 --> 25:32.131
HUH. THAT'S WEIRD.

25:32.131 --> 25:33.232
WHAT?

25:33.232 --> 25:35.605
I HAVE
AN "ISN'T THAT IRONIC?" APP

25:35.605 --> 25:37.937
THAT USUALLY BUZZES WHEN
PEOPLE SAY STUFF LIKE THAT.

25:37.937 --> 25:41.611
I'M SERIOUS, LYNETTE.
THAT'S WHERE I WORK.

25:41.611 --> 25:44.113
IT WAS JUST DRINKS
WITH A GUY I KNOW,

25:44.113 --> 25:45.775
WHO HAPPENS TO BE YOUR BOSS.
 (packaging rustling)

25:45.775 --> 25:47.546
I PROMISE NOT TO DO
ANYTHING EMBARRASSING

25:47.546 --> 25:51.921
LIKE...
KISS HIM IN THE OFFICE.

25:54.023 --> 25:57.126
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU WANNA SEE GREGG?

25:57.126 --> 25:59.128
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

25:59.128 --> 26:01.961
(door closes)

26:03.993 --> 26:05.765
HEY.
 HMM?

26:05.765 --> 26:07.937
HOW ABOUT IF INSTEAD OF
EATING THIS SANDWICH,

26:07.937 --> 26:09.799
I JUST WANTED
TO EAT CHOCOLATE?

26:09.799 --> 26:12.341
HEY. HOW ABOUT... "NO"?

26:12.341 --> 26:15.975
BUT WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
SOMETHING ABOUT DAD AND JANE

26:15.975 --> 26:18.978
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU
VERY HAPPY?

26:18.978 --> 26:20.149
THEN COULD I?

26:20.149 --> 26:23.813
WHY, YOU LITTLE FINAGLER.

26:23.813 --> 26:25.615
HOW DO I KNOW YOUR INFORMATION
IS EVEN WORTH

26:25.615 --> 26:28.818
THE FINE BELGIAN CHOCOLATES THAT
I HAVE HIDDEN IN THE PANTRY?

26:28.818 --> 26:30.059
OH, IT IS.

26:30.059 --> 26:32.321
OH. (laughs)
IT WOULD BE WRONG TO TEACH YOU

26:32.321 --> 26:34.764
THAT THIS KIND OF BLACKMAIL
WORKS.

26:34.764 --> 26:38.668
BESIDES, I CAN SEE YOU'RE JUST
BURSTING TO TELL ME ANYWAY.

26:38.668 --> 26:41.801
WHEN DAD TOLD JANE
HE HAD TO WORK THIS WEEKEND,

26:41.801 --> 26:43.072
SHE KIND OF LOST IT.

26:43.072 --> 26:46.305
REALLY? THE CHOCOLATE
THAT I AM IN NO WAY TRADING

26:46.305 --> 26:48.838
FOR THIS INFORMATION
HAS ALMONDS IN IT.

26:48.838 --> 26:52.011
SHE WAS ALL,
"WE NEVER HAVE TIME TOGETHER"

26:52.011 --> 26:55.144
AND "YOU STILL HAVEN'T
FILED THE DIVORCE PAPERS."

26:55.144 --> 26:57.316
IS THAT TRUE? HE HASN'T?

26:57.316 --> 27:01.851
THE ENVELOPE IS STILL SITTING
ON A SHELF IN THE KITCHEN.

27:01.851 --> 27:03.192
PUT THE SANDWICH DOWN,

27:03.192 --> 27:05.094
OR YOU WON'T HAVE ANY ROOM
LEFT FOR CHOCOLATE.

27:12.902 --> 27:16.736
AH. WELL, LOOK WHO STROLLED IN
FROM THE OUTBACK.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.037
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?

27:18.037 --> 27:21.841
SORRY. I REALLY NEEDED
TO SORT THROUGH SOME STUFF.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.973
STUFF? YOU MEAN
WHAT HORS D'OEUVRES

27:23.973 --> 27:25.414
WE'LL BE SERVING
AT THE WEDDING,

27:25.414 --> 27:28.077
OR ARE YOU REFERRING
TO THE DEAD BODY?

27:31.220 --> 27:36.025
HEY, IF YOU PLAN ON STAYING,
YOU'D BETTER START TALKING.

27:36.025 --> 27:40.760
I AM IMPOSSIBLY
IN LOVE WITH YOU, RENEE.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.662
AND THERE'S NOTHING I WANT MORE
THAN TO COME CLEAN.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.294
BUT IF I TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON,

27:45.294 --> 27:47.366
YOU COULD GET DRAGGED
INTO THIS,

27:47.366 --> 27:50.299
AND THEN YOU'RE AT RISK,
TOO.

27:53.903 --> 27:56.145
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

27:56.145 --> 27:59.378
YOUR EX KEPT SECRETS
TO HURT YOU.

27:59.378 --> 28:02.181
I'M KEEPING THEM
TO PROTECT YOU.

28:04.784 --> 28:05.815
OKAY.

28:05.815 --> 28:09.358
REALLY? THAT WAS EASY.

28:09.358 --> 28:12.822
(cork pops)
 WELL, WHILE YOU WERE
ON YOUR WALKABOUT,

28:12.822 --> 28:15.765
I REMEMBERED SOMETHING.

28:17.166 --> 28:19.098
SPOUSAL PRIVILEGE.

28:19.098 --> 28:20.469
WHICH IS?

28:20.469 --> 28:22.101
IT'S A CRAZY LAW
WE HAVE HERE.

28:22.101 --> 28:25.975
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TESTIFY
AGAINST YOUR HUSBAND.

28:25.975 --> 28:28.007
SO HERE'S WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN.

28:28.007 --> 28:30.810
WE SAY "I DO,"
WE WALK BACK UP THE AISLE,

28:30.810 --> 28:32.441
THE SECOND
WE'RE OUTSIDE THAT CHURCH,

28:32.441 --> 28:34.744
YOU TELL ME EVERYTHING.

28:34.744 --> 28:36.215
AND IF I DON'T?

28:36.215 --> 28:38.317
WELL, THEN I GUESS
YOU WON'T BE SEEING

28:38.317 --> 28:42.151
THOSE WEDDING NIGHT MOVES
I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

28:42.151 --> 28:43.252
AND TRUST ME...

28:44.754 --> 28:47.126
MY SECRET IS WAY BETTER
THAN YOURS.

28:55.304 --> 28:56.866
AHH, SO YOU ARE ALIVE.

28:56.866 --> 28:59.138
YOU'RE JUST NOT ANSWERING
YOUR PHONE.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.140
I'M SORRY. I JUST...

29:01.140 --> 29:02.842
CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT YOU MUST THINK OF ME

29:02.842 --> 29:04.213
AFTER HEARING ALL THAT.

29:09.979 --> 29:12.221
BREE, LISTEN,
I DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE.

29:12.221 --> 29:13.853
I DEFEND THEM.

29:13.853 --> 29:16.325
AND IF I'M GONNA DEFEND YOU,
I NEED TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

29:16.325 --> 29:18.327
(sighs)

29:18.327 --> 29:21.160
SEXUAL HISTORY
FROM YOUR FIRST HUSBAND

29:21.160 --> 29:23.092
DOWN TO THE LAST GUY
ON THE D.A.'s WITNESS LIST.

29:23.092 --> 29:25.294
HOW ABOUT I GO IN THE KITCHEN
AND SAY IT,

29:25.294 --> 29:28.197
AND YOU JUST...
LISTEN FROM OUT HERE?

29:28.197 --> 29:30.239
NO DICE. I NEED YOU
TO SAY IT TO MY FACE.

29:30.239 --> 29:31.770
WHY?

29:31.770 --> 29:34.773
BECAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE SITTING
AT THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE

29:34.773 --> 29:37.106
WHILE ONE GUY AFTER ANOTHER
TAKES THE STAND

29:37.106 --> 29:40.349
AND GOES INTO AS MUCH
GRAPHIC DETAIL

29:40.349 --> 29:42.111
AS THE PROSECUTOR
WANTS HIM TO,

29:42.111 --> 29:45.184
AND THE WHOLE TIME THE JURY IS
GONNA BE LOOKING AT YOUR FACE.

29:45.184 --> 29:46.355
OH, DEAR GOD.

29:46.355 --> 29:49.358
AND IF THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE
IS GUILT,

29:49.358 --> 29:50.920
THEY'RE GONNA THINK
YOU'RE GUILTY.

29:52.491 --> 29:56.365
SO I NEED YOU TO OWN
THIS PART OF YOUR LIFE,

29:56.365 --> 29:59.098
AND THAT STARTS WITH YOU
TELLING ME EVERYTHING.

30:03.973 --> 30:05.975
OKAY.

30:05.975 --> 30:07.376
I HOPED IT WOULDN'T
COME TO THIS, BUT, UH,

30:07.376 --> 30:09.808
MAYBE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL
IF I TOLD YOU

30:09.808 --> 30:11.310
MY SEXUAL SECRETS FIRST.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.913
NO, IT MOST CERTAINLY
WOULD NOT BE HELPFUL.

30:13.913 --> 30:16.215
BESIDES,
MEN AREN'T EMBARRASSED

30:16.215 --> 30:18.087
TO BRAG
ABOUT THEIR CONQUESTS.

30:18.087 --> 30:21.350
I'M GONNA START TALKING NOW.

30:21.350 --> 30:24.253
FIRST TIME I HAD SEX...

30:24.253 --> 30:25.955
I WAS 24.

30:25.955 --> 30:27.296
I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL.

30:27.296 --> 30:30.329
SHE WAS A CLASSMATE
AND RATHER EXPERIENCED.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.361
IT DIDN'T GO VERY WELL,

30:32.361 --> 30:34.363
OR FOR THAT MATTER,
LAST VERY LONG.

30:34.363 --> 30:35.464
(chuckles)

30:35.464 --> 30:38.067
YEAH, YEAH,
IT'S HILARIOUS.

30:38.067 --> 30:39.939
(chuckles) IN FACT,
EVERY CHRISTMAS,

30:39.939 --> 30:42.271
I GET A CARD FROM HER
THAT SAYS, "STILL LAUGHING."

30:42.271 --> 30:45.314
(laughs) SO YOU HAD
AN AWKWARD FIRST EXPERIENCE.

30:45.314 --> 30:46.315
WHO DIDN'T?

30:46.315 --> 30:49.448
YOU WANT WORSE?
I-I CAN DO WORSE.

30:52.021 --> 30:53.182
OKAY.

30:53.182 --> 30:57.256
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS.
UM...

30:57.256 --> 31:01.961
I AM... QUITE OVERSIZED
DOWN THERE.

31:03.192 --> 31:05.364
SINCE WHEN IS A MAN
BEING WELL ENDOWED

31:05.364 --> 31:06.595
CONSIDERED HUMILIATING?

31:06.595 --> 31:09.098
I'M TALKING
ABOUT MY PROSTATE--

31:09.098 --> 31:11.140
MY ENLARGED PROSTATE.

31:11.140 --> 31:14.303
BEST PART--
YOUR DOCTOR TELLS YOU

31:14.303 --> 31:16.875
IT ONLY HAPPENS
TO OLDER MEN.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.278
THAT'S THE REASON YOU HAVE
TO PEE 30 TIMES A DAY.

31:19.278 --> 31:24.083
SO NOW YOU KNOW I'M PUSHING 50,
BORDERLINE INCONTINENT,

31:24.083 --> 31:26.385
AND WOMEN ARE SCARED
OF MY JUNK.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.888
IS THAT HUMILIATING ENOUGH
FOR YOU?

31:29.888 --> 31:31.360
YES, I THINK IT IS.

31:31.360 --> 31:33.192
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

31:33.192 --> 31:37.466
OH. I HAVE TO TELL YOU NOW,
DON'T I?

31:42.401 --> 31:44.903
(sighs) HMM.

31:47.306 --> 31:50.279
I WAS IN A DARK PLACE...

31:50.279 --> 31:52.411
LONELY...

31:52.411 --> 31:55.084
AND IN PAIN, I STARTED...

31:55.084 --> 31:58.587
DRINKING... AGAIN.

32:07.256 --> 32:08.397
(indistinct conversations)

32:08.397 --> 32:10.229
SO THE KICKER
TO THE STORY IS,

32:10.229 --> 32:12.601
THE NEW INTERNATIONAL PLAN
THAT TOM CAME UP WITH IS--

32:12.601 --> 32:13.932
IS PRETTY AWESOME.
 MM.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.434
HE MAY NOT HAVE GOOD TASTE
IN WOMEN,

32:15.434 --> 32:18.337
BUT HE IS DAMN SMART
ABOUT FINANCE.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.009
TOM IS REALLY SMART...

32:20.009 --> 32:23.642
IN THAT ONE AREA.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.144
POOR JANE.

32:25.144 --> 32:26.645
(clink)
 YOU'RE REALLY ENJOYING THIS,
AREN'T YOU?

32:26.645 --> 32:29.018
UM... A LITTLE, TINY BIT.

32:29.018 --> 32:30.179
YOU SHOULD.

32:30.179 --> 32:31.280
I WISH I HAD A WAY
OF GETTING BACK AT CRYSTAL

32:31.280 --> 32:32.681
WHEN WE WERE BREAKING UP.

32:32.681 --> 32:34.323
MUST FEEL GOOD.

32:34.323 --> 32:36.255
JANE WAS PRETTY PISSED, HUH?

32:36.255 --> 32:38.557
OH, APPARENTLY.
SO EVEN THOUGH THAT MAKES ME

32:38.557 --> 32:40.689
A TERRIBLE PERSON,
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

32:40.689 --> 32:44.193
ANYTIME. I MEAN THAT.

32:44.193 --> 32:45.194
ANYTIME.

32:45.194 --> 32:47.666
(chuckles) SO...

32:47.666 --> 32:50.069
IF I ASKED YOU TO HAVE TOM
WORK A FEW NIGHTS THIS WEEK,

32:50.069 --> 32:51.370
YOU'D DO IT?

32:51.370 --> 32:53.472
IF I COULD HELP YOU
PISS OFF YOUR EX

32:53.472 --> 32:56.745
AND SPEND MORE TIME WITH YOU,
I SEE NO DOWNSIDE IN THAT.

32:56.745 --> 32:58.277
YOU JUST SAY THE WORD.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.278
REALLY?

32:59.278 --> 33:01.210
LATE NIGHTS, WEEKENDS.

33:01.210 --> 33:03.012
MAYBE EVEN A FEW
OUT-OF-TOWN TRIPS?

33:03.012 --> 33:05.554
YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT,

33:05.554 --> 33:07.356
I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

33:07.356 --> 33:10.619
OH. (laughs)
I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

33:10.619 --> 33:13.162
MUST BE WHY WOMEN FALL
FOR POWERFUL MEN.

33:16.625 --> 33:18.327
AND THEN
THE PROSECUTOR SUGGESTED

33:18.327 --> 33:21.570
I WAS PROBABLY SO DRUNK,
THAT I FORGOT THE WHOLE THING.

33:21.570 --> 33:23.732
WELL, HANG ON.
DIDN'T YOUR HOTSHOT LAWYER

33:23.732 --> 33:25.434
GET ALL UP IN HER FACE
WITH THE "OBJECTIONS"

33:25.434 --> 33:26.605
AND THE "SIDEBARS"

33:26.605 --> 33:28.277
AND THE "YOU CAN'T HANDLE
THE TRUTH!"?

33:28.277 --> 33:29.538
TRIP WAS AMAZING,

33:29.538 --> 33:31.440
BUT SHE STILL SAID
IT WAS ADMISSIBLE.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.283
MY ENTIRE SORDID PAST
IS ADMISSIBLE.

33:34.283 --> 33:35.714
SO JUST BECAUSE YOU SLEPT
WITH A FEW GUYS

33:35.714 --> 33:37.686
MEANS YOU SLEPT
WITH ALEJANDRO?

33:37.686 --> 33:40.289
MORE THAN A FEW.

33:40.289 --> 33:42.591
SORRY. CARRY ON.

33:42.591 --> 33:45.624
YOU KNOW WHAT
THE WORST THING WAS?

33:45.624 --> 33:49.298
THE LOOK ON TRIP'S FACE.
HE WAS SO DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

33:49.298 --> 33:52.231
WAIT. THAT WAS
THE WORST THING?

33:52.231 --> 33:54.703
WORSE THAN THE WHOLE
SHARING-A-CELL-FOR-20-YEARS-

33:54.703 --> 33:57.066
WITH-A-BIG-GAL-NAMED-VERN
THING?

33:57.066 --> 33:58.637
WELL, I'M NOT GOING
TO PRISON.

33:58.637 --> 33:59.668
I MEAN, TRIP SAYS
WE'RE GONNA WIN,

33:59.668 --> 34:01.240
AND I BELIEVE IN HIM.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.212
I JUST THANK GOD THAT
EVEN AFTER ALL OF THIS,

34:03.212 --> 34:04.613
HE STILL BELIEVES IN ME.

34:07.776 --> 34:10.518
OKAY, I'M GONNA SAY IT.
 (cup clatters)

34:10.518 --> 34:12.781
BREE, YOU HAVE A CRUSH
ON YOUR LAWYER.

34:12.781 --> 34:14.753
(scoffs) DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

34:14.753 --> 34:18.157
YOU DO SOUND
A TEENSY BIT SMITTEN.

34:18.157 --> 34:21.630
I AM NOT SMITTEN. I-I HAPPEN TO
ADMIRE HIS LEGAL SKILLS, AND--

34:21.630 --> 34:24.062
HIS DREAMY BLUE EYES?

34:24.062 --> 34:27.795
THEY'RE NOT BLUE. THEY'RE GREEN,
FLECKED WITH HINTS OF BROWN.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.702
OKAY, MAYBE I FIND HIM
ATTRACTIVE,

34:33.702 --> 34:35.674
BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK I WOULD
PUT MYSELF AT RISK

34:35.674 --> 34:37.106
BY DATING MY OWN ATTORNEY?

34:37.106 --> 34:38.246
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

34:38.246 --> 34:40.248
YOU PUT US ALL AT RISK
WHEN YOU DATED CHUCK.

34:40.248 --> 34:45.184
LOOK, HAVING A CRUSH
IS NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.716
HE'S RESCUING YOU,
AND IT'S IN OUR D.N.A.

34:47.716 --> 34:50.219
TO FALL FOR GUYS
WHO RESCUE US.

34:50.219 --> 34:53.762
BUT IN THIS CASE, IT'S JUST
NOT SAFE FOR YOU TO ACT ON IT.

34:53.762 --> 34:55.824
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:55.824 --> 34:57.666
YOU'RE ON TRIAL
FOR MURDER, BREE.

34:57.666 --> 34:59.698
YOU GOT TO KEEP
A CLEAR HEAD.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.600
AND SO DOES HE.

35:04.373 --> 35:06.805
DORIS, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE.

35:06.805 --> 35:09.178
YOUR DONATION IS GONNA HELP
SO MANY RECOVERING ADDICTS

35:09.178 --> 35:10.539
GET BACK ON THEIR FEET.

35:10.539 --> 35:13.512
OH, STOP. (chuckles)
I SHOULD BE THANKING YOU

35:13.512 --> 35:15.314
FOR LETTING ME BE A PART
OF ALL THIS.

35:15.314 --> 35:17.846
MM, AND PLEASE FORGIVE
THE APPEARANCE OF MY OFFICE.

35:17.846 --> 35:20.789
EVERY PENNY THAT WE GET
GOES DIRECTLY TO THOSE IN NEED,

35:20.789 --> 35:23.222
SO THERE'S NOT A LOT
LEFT OVER FOR...

35:23.222 --> 35:26.725
NICE... THINGS.

35:30.699 --> 35:33.202
THOSE IN NEED, HUH?

35:33.202 --> 35:34.863
THIS IS NOT MY STUFF!

35:34.863 --> 35:37.806
I HAD A SIMPLE WOODEN DESK,
AN OLD COFFEE TABLE.

35:37.806 --> 35:39.808
OH.

35:39.808 --> 35:41.870
AND A BABY GRAND.

35:41.870 --> 35:43.242
WELL, THAT MUST COME IN HANDY

35:43.242 --> 35:45.844
WHILE YOU'RE ALL SINGING
"KUMBAYA"

35:45.844 --> 35:48.577
DURING
YOUR CLEAN NEEDLE EXCHANGE.

35:48.577 --> 35:51.780
DORIS, PLEASE. THIS IS NOT
WHAT WE'RE ABOUT HERE.

35:51.780 --> 35:54.853
FIND YOURSELF ANOTHER OLD LADY
TO FLEECE.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.485
(sighs)

35:59.828 --> 36:01.790
(door opens)

36:01.790 --> 36:04.263
HONEY, I NEED TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING IN THE GARAGE.

36:04.263 --> 36:05.894
DID YOU FIX THE CAR?

36:05.894 --> 36:08.497
NO. JUANITA USED THE WOOD
TO BUILD A COFFIN

36:08.497 --> 36:10.939
FOR THE SQUIRREL, BUT I DO HAVE
A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU.

36:10.939 --> 36:14.543
(sighs)

36:16.505 --> 36:17.706
AHEM.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.909
OH, HEY, PERFECT TIMING,
M.J.

36:20.909 --> 36:22.581
WE COULD REALLY USE
ANOTHER PAIR OF HANDS.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.853
(lowered voice)
WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE?

36:24.853 --> 36:27.786
WELL, I KNOW I TOLD YOU
THAT I COULD DO THIS MYSELF,

36:27.786 --> 36:30.319
BUT I GOT TO THINKING
THAT EVERY RACE CAR DRIVER

36:30.319 --> 36:32.891
HAS A PIT CREW,
AND THIS IS YOURS.

36:32.891 --> 36:35.424
WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU.

36:35.424 --> 36:36.725
AND NOT JUST ABOUT CAR STUFF,
YOU KNOW?

36:36.725 --> 36:40.629
ANYTIME YOU NEED SOMETHING,
GIVE US A CALL.

36:40.629 --> 36:42.531
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS DESIGN?
 HEY?

36:42.531 --> 36:44.873
IT... KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE A CORVETTE.

36:44.873 --> 36:46.775
KIND OF?
IT'S AN EXACT RENDERING.

36:46.775 --> 36:48.837
LOOK AT THE SHADING
ON THE WHEEL WELL.

36:48.837 --> 36:51.209
CALM DOWN. YOU TRACED IT
OUT OF A MAGAZINE.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.942
CAN YOU GUYS
REALLY BUILD THIS?

36:53.942 --> 36:56.485
UM, WELL...
NOT WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

36:57.986 --> 36:59.888
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT COLOR?

36:59.888 --> 37:02.220
RED OR BLUE?

37:02.220 --> 37:03.922
MOM? WHAT DO YOU THINK?

37:03.922 --> 37:08.757
I THINK, UH...
THIS IS KIND OF A GUY THING,

37:08.757 --> 37:11.430
AND I SHOULD LET YOU GUYS
 GET TO WORK.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.502
MY DAD LOVED CORVETTES.

37:13.502 --> 37:14.633
WE KNOW.

37:14.633 --> 37:15.904
HE ALWAYS SAID IF HE EVER
WON THE LOTTERY,

37:15.904 --> 37:20.539
FIRST THING HE'D DO IS BUY
A CORVETTE STINGRAY CONVERTIBLE.

37:31.350 --> 37:33.582
(knock on door)

37:33.582 --> 37:34.653
HEY.
 HEY.

37:34.653 --> 37:35.754
COME ON IN.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.787
WHOA. (laughs)
YOU LOOK LIKE A MILLION BUCKS.

37:38.787 --> 37:41.029
AW.
 AND TRUST ME, I KNOW WHAT
A MILLION BUCKS LOOKS LIKE.

37:41.029 --> 37:43.632
WHAT A LOVELY COMPLIMENT...

37:43.632 --> 37:45.394
FOR ONE OF US.

37:45.394 --> 37:47.966
SO, UH, GALLO IS
THE BEST RESTAURANT IN TOWN,

37:47.966 --> 37:49.938
AND AFTER TONIGHT,
YOU WILL KNOW WHY.

37:49.938 --> 37:54.042
WELL, CAN'T WAIT.

37:54.042 --> 37:55.904
LET'S GO.

37:55.904 --> 37:57.976
BUT FIRST...
I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU.

37:57.976 --> 37:59.748
UH-HUH?

38:01.980 --> 38:03.512
A NAIL.

38:03.512 --> 38:05.384
HOW THOUGHTFUL...

38:05.384 --> 38:06.885
AND... IMAGINARY.

38:06.885 --> 38:10.058
A NAIL IN THE COFFIN
OF TOM'S HAPPINESS.

38:10.058 --> 38:12.861
THE END OF TOM AND JANE.

38:12.861 --> 38:14.563
COMPLETELY BAFFLED.

38:14.563 --> 38:15.924
EVERY TIME THIS WEEK
I TOLD HIM I NEEDED HIM LATE,

38:15.924 --> 38:17.526
TOM WOULD GO IN HIS OFFICE,

38:17.526 --> 38:20.829
AND I'D HEAR HIM ON THE PHONE
IN A BIG FIGHT WITH JANE.

38:20.829 --> 38:24.873
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
TELLING ME THIS.

38:24.873 --> 38:27.376
BUT... (high-pitched voice)
YAY!

38:27.376 --> 38:29.007
SO HOW DO YOU THINK
THE PERSNICKETY MS. CARLSON

38:29.007 --> 38:31.840
WILL HANDLE THE NEWS
OF TOM'S TRANSFER?

38:31.840 --> 38:33.682
HIS WHAT?

38:33.682 --> 38:35.684
THE INTERNATIONAL PLAN
NEEDS A POINT MAN,

38:35.684 --> 38:39.317
SO I'M SENDING TOM TO MUMBAI
FOR A YEAR.

38:41.490 --> 38:44.523
M-MUMBAI LIKE...
INDIA MUMBAI?

38:44.523 --> 38:45.724
MM-HMM.

38:45.724 --> 38:48.627
WHICH MEANS YOU AND I
WILL HAVE FAIRVIEW

38:48.627 --> 38:51.460
ALL TO OURSELVES.

38:51.460 --> 38:52.861
WE GOT TO GO.

38:55.934 --> 38:57.906
LYNETTE?

38:57.906 --> 38:59.968
CAR.
 HUH?

39:02.941 --> 39:04.773
(sighs)

39:04.773 --> 39:06.845
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT TO MY OFFICE.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.076
I HAD A BUTLER LINED UP,

39:08.076 --> 39:10.779
BUT HE BOOKED A COMMERCIAL
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

39:10.779 --> 39:12.921
SO I GUESS I'LL CALL DORIS NOW
AND MAKE AN APPOINTMENT

39:12.921 --> 39:14.753
FOR SHOPPING TOMORROW.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.585
YEAH, I DON'T THINK SHE'LL BE
ANSWERING EITHER OF OUR CALLS.

39:16.585 --> 39:19.357
SHE THINKS WE'RE BOTH NUTS,
SO THANKS A LOT, GABY.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.029
YOU STARTED IT. YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO STOLE HER FROM ME

39:21.029 --> 39:22.461
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.092
YEAH, FOR SOMETHING
THAT MATTERS.

39:24.092 --> 39:26.895
OH, ENOUGH WITH
THE CARLOS OF NAZARETH ACT.

39:26.895 --> 39:27.896
THIS WASN'T ABOUT
HELPING PEOPLE.

39:27.896 --> 39:29.668
THIS WAS ABOUT YOU
SMELLING MONEY

39:29.668 --> 39:30.969
AND GOING AFTER IT.

39:30.969 --> 39:34.843
THE MONEY WAS FOR THE CENTER.
THOSE PEOPLE NEED IT.

39:34.843 --> 39:37.546
THE CENTER? PLEASE.
YOU WERE DOING IT TO WIN.

39:37.546 --> 39:39.077
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

39:39.077 --> 39:41.079
'CAUSE YOU'RE A SHARK,
CARLOS.

39:41.079 --> 39:44.012
YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN,
AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE.

39:44.012 --> 39:45.514
IT'S YOUR NATURE.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.921
HONEY.

39:52.921 --> 39:55.093
IT'S OKAY. I AM, TOO.

39:55.093 --> 39:58.627
THAT'S WHY
WE'RE GOOD TOGETHER.

39:58.627 --> 40:01.630
LOOK, I MAY NOT LIKE THAT
YOU STOLE DORIS FROM ME,

40:01.630 --> 40:04.973
BUT I DO LIKE THAT
YOU'RE THE TYPE OF GUY WHO CAN.

40:04.973 --> 40:07.005
IT'S SEXY.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.406
BUT...

40:08.406 --> 40:10.909
THAT'S NOT WHO
I WANT TO BE ANYMORE.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.511
WELL, WHO DO YOU
WANT TO BE?

40:15.043 --> 40:16.745
SOMEBODY DIFFERENT.

40:16.745 --> 40:19.147
WELL, I HATE
TO TELL YOU THIS, BABE,

40:19.147 --> 40:19.988
BUT THE BEST
YOU CAN HOPE TO BE

40:19.988 --> 40:22.521
IS JUST A DIFFERENT KIND
OF SHARK.

40:27.025 --> 40:32.030
YES, IT ISN'T EASY
GIVING UP POWER...

40:32.030 --> 40:36.104
ADMITTING
THAT WE MIGHT NEED HELP

40:36.104 --> 40:39.808
FROM FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS...

40:39.808 --> 40:43.612
DECIDING THAT A LOVED ONE...

40:43.612 --> 40:47.476
MIGHT KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR US.

40:47.476 --> 40:51.019
GIVING UP OUR BETTER JUDGMENT

40:51.019 --> 40:56.054
FOR A SLIGHTLY DARKER AGENDA.

40:56.054 --> 40:59.057
BUT FOR SOME,

40:59.057 --> 41:02.561
THE HARDEST KIND OF POWER
TO GIVE UP...

41:02.561 --> 41:07.996
IS THE POWER TO CONTROL
THEIR OWN DESIRES.

41:07.996 --> 41:11.870
HELLO.
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

41:11.870 --> 41:14.072
DID YOU, UH, HAVE SOME
NEW THOUGHTS ON THE CASE?

41:14.072 --> 41:17.546
LOTS, BUT WHY DON'T
WE DISCUSS THEM OVER DINNER?

41:17.546 --> 41:20.509
DINNER.
UM, CAN'T WE TALK HERE?

41:20.509 --> 41:22.080
NO, I'VE BEEN COOPED UP
ALL DAY,

41:22.080 --> 41:24.152
AND I KNOW THIS
GREAT, LITTLE ITALIAN PLACE.

41:24.152 --> 41:26.084
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

41:26.084 --> 41:28.116
OH, COME ON.
I'M A MUCH BETTER LAWYER

41:28.116 --> 41:31.189
AFTER A PLATE
OF SPAGHETTI CARBONARA.

41:31.189 --> 41:34.192
SO? WHAT DO YOU SAY?

41:34.192 --> 41:38.527
I SAY...

41:38.527 --> 41:39.898
(chuckles)

41:39.898 --> 41:42.100
LET'S DO IT.
