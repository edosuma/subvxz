It's a wonderful world

01:26.580 --> 01:31.142
I'm just walking on air

01:31.150 --> 01:33.642
talk of heaven on earth

01:33.660 --> 01:38.222
I've got more
than my share

01:38.230 --> 01:41.825
haven't got a care

01:41.830 --> 01:45.323
happy all day through

01:51.910 --> 01:55.972
it's a wonderful,
wonderful, wonderful world

...More than my share

02:07.390 --> 02:11.054
haven't got a care

02:11.060 --> 02:14.052
John, are you in here?

02:14.060 --> 02:18.327
It's just a wonderful,
wonderful, wonderful world

02:18.330 --> 02:21.789
loving wonderful you

02:24.070 --> 02:28.200
I'm gonna call the cops,
I swear to god.

02:29.910 --> 02:35.041
Ok. That's it. I am gonna
call the cops right now.

02:35.050 --> 02:37.314
[ringing]

02:37.320 --> 02:39.516
Operator: 911. What's
your emergency?

02:39.520 --> 02:43.115
Yeah. This
is francine johnson, and--

02:43.130 --> 02:46.156
[screaming]

02:54.270 --> 02:55.760
Ohh!

03:05.210 --> 03:06.769
Aah!

03:06.780 --> 03:10.239
Lee: happy all day through

03:30.670 --> 03:33.833
Man: Agent gregg,
you got a sec?

03:33.840 --> 03:36.502
I'm detective doug baer,
robbery homicide.

03:36.510 --> 03:38.069
Uh, you're filling in
for beth, right?

03:38.080 --> 03:39.741
Uh, yes, but it's
only temporary.

03:39.750 --> 03:42.310
A woman by the name
of francine johnson

03:42.320 --> 03:44.049
Was murdered in her home
last night.

03:44.050 --> 03:46.041
Checked the database,
and it says that tau handled

03:46.060 --> 03:48.654
A stalking case
for the victim a year ago.

03:48.660 --> 03:51.652
Any information you can give
us would be greatly appreciated.

03:51.660 --> 03:53.583
Sure. T'll look
into it.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.728
Thank you.
Thank you.

03:55.730 --> 03:57.960
Have you thought anymore
about leaving .A.?

03:57.970 --> 04:00.029
Yes. Some.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.599
I don't know
what to do.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.466
Pending the results
of your internal review,

04:03.470 --> 04:07.634
There is no reason you
can't resume your job quickly.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.701
Do you miss it?

04:10.710 --> 04:13.680
I do. I love my job.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.684
But I feel like this career
belongs to beth davis,

04:18.690 --> 04:21.660
And now everyone
knows me as michelle.

04:21.660 --> 04:23.219
It's all over the news.

04:23.230 --> 04:25.426
Hmm.

04:25.430 --> 04:29.151
I changed my identity
when I was 20,

04:29.160 --> 04:31.959
So my entire adult life
has been spent

04:31.970 --> 04:34.359
As beth davis.

04:34.370 --> 04:37.965
I don't know who
michelle is anymore.

04:37.970 --> 04:40.359
Janice: Francine johnson
was stalked for several months

04:40.380 --> 04:42.371
By her abusive boyfriend
john murray.

04:42.380 --> 04:44.701
He was charged
with stalking, battery,

04:44.710 --> 04:46.747
Was sentenced to a year,
served 8 months,

04:46.750 --> 04:51.142
I just got confirmation that john
murray checked into a minnesota rehab

04:51.150 --> 04:53.414
There's no way he murdered
francine johnson.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.980
Well, I'll let baer
know. Thank you.

04:58.790 --> 05:00.781
Hey.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.668
You know, a stalking here,
a threat there.

05:04.670 --> 05:07.423
I'm good. I was
just in the building,

05:07.440 --> 05:09.169
So I thought I'd
come and say hi.

05:09.170 --> 05:10.990
Any idea when you're
coming back to work.

05:11.010 --> 05:14.878
It's been suggested
that I take some time off.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.771
I don't know.
Could be a while.

05:18.780 --> 05:20.305
Why? You don't think
I should?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.469
Oh, it's--it's not that.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.073
It's just that
you thrive on work,

05:23.090 --> 05:25.184
But, yeah, you should
take as much time as you need

05:25.190 --> 05:28.251
If that's what you want.

05:28.260 --> 05:29.011
Yeah.

05:29.020 --> 05:30.909
Janice: Hey, stranger.

05:30.930 --> 05:32.921
Hi!

05:32.930 --> 05:35.228
Much better.
They're gonna release him

05:35.230 --> 05:36.459
At the end
of the week.

05:36.470 --> 05:37.722
Great. I'm gonna
stop by the hospital

05:37.730 --> 05:40.427
On my way home.
He'd like that.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.839
Heh.
Heh.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.262
I'm gonna go.

05:43.270 --> 05:44.669
Come back to us, beth.

05:44.670 --> 05:45.808
Thanks.
Keep in touch.

05:45.810 --> 05:48.199
Hey. Uh, we should
get together for drinks

05:48.210 --> 05:49.439
Or something.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.475
You do owe me.

05:51.480 --> 05:52.379
For what?

05:52.380 --> 05:53.905
I saved your life.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.777
Well, I think that might
be worth a whole dinner,

05:57.790 --> 05:59.747
Don't you think?

06:02.620 --> 06:04.725
When you first filed a
report against your husband

06:04.730 --> 06:06.926
Darren tyler
3 months ago--

06:06.930 --> 06:08.329
All more 4 now.

06:08.330 --> 06:10.253
He was harassing you
over your breakup,

06:10.270 --> 06:13.729
Showing up at your work,
gym, restaurants.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.333
He was hurt,
he wanted you back.

06:15.340 --> 06:17.536
He can't understand
why I broke up with him.

06:17.540 --> 06:20.009
He only slept with every woman
who looked in his direction.

06:20.010 --> 06:21.808
Well, the judge granted
you a tro.

06:21.810 --> 06:23.369
Has he violated it?

06:23.380 --> 06:24.745
Yes.

06:24.750 --> 06:28.516
This morning, I found
this on my doorstep--

06:28.520 --> 06:30.409
My favorite bottle
of champagne

06:30.420 --> 06:33.720
Along with a play list
of taylor swift love songs.

06:33.720 --> 06:35.609
Does the music have
symbolic meaning?

06:35.620 --> 06:38.988
Do I look like I listen
to taylor swift?

06:38.990 --> 06:40.651
Are you sure darren
left these?

06:40.660 --> 06:42.321
Flowers last week,
perfume the week before.

06:42.330 --> 06:45.129
Well, you came to us because
he was threatening you.

06:45.130 --> 06:47.167
And now he's politely
stalking me. Whatever.

06:47.170 --> 06:48.899
I just want him
to stop.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.664
If you didn't see him
leave these things,

06:50.670 --> 06:51.831
Uh, we don't have
any proof.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.604
Well, I never saw him,
but I know it was him.

06:53.610 --> 06:55.669
Cheap flowers,
rank-ass-smelling perfume.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.103
I was married to the man.
He had zero taste.

06:58.110 --> 06:59.578
How can I get him
to stop?

06:59.580 --> 07:01.070
Well, he's trying
a different approach,

07:01.080 --> 07:03.777
Which indicates
an escalation.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.713
If he gets violent--
if?

07:05.720 --> 07:06.812
More like when.

07:06.820 --> 07:07.890
Darren has a temper.

07:07.890 --> 07:09.187
These gifts
don't fool me.

07:09.190 --> 07:11.830
He's one love song
away from snapping.

07:11.830 --> 07:12.888
He's not right
in his head.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.722
Look. I have done
everything you told me to do.

07:15.730 --> 07:18.529
I got a restraining order,
I changed my schedule,

07:18.530 --> 07:20.020
I take a different route
home every day,

07:20.040 --> 07:21.599
I shop
at 10 different stores.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.830
The only thing left
for me to do is to move.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.639
I can't afford to move.
I have a job here.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.904
He is ruining
my life.

07:28.910 --> 07:32.039
Can you just arrest
his ass?

07:36.950 --> 07:38.611
I don't scare easily,

07:38.620 --> 07:40.941
But this is
really getting to me.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.554
Look. I'll talk
to him.

07:43.560 --> 07:47.986
We're gonna get you
through this, I promise.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.737
Hi. I'm looking
for vicky gregg.

08:03.110 --> 08:05.101
Will!

08:05.110 --> 08:05.770
Hey.

08:05.780 --> 08:07.145
What are you
doing here?

08:07.150 --> 08:08.743
Didn't you get
my message?

08:08.750 --> 08:10.172
Didn't you get mine?

08:10.190 --> 08:12.545
[sighs]

08:12.550 --> 08:14.609
Come in here.

08:23.130 --> 08:24.552
Who's the, uh--

08:24.570 --> 08:25.321
No idea.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.627
Why are you here, will?

08:26.640 --> 08:28.995
It's good to see
you, too, vicky.

08:29.000 --> 08:29.865
Please.

08:29.870 --> 08:32.339
No. Don't sit down.
You're not staying.

08:32.340 --> 08:34.229
I left you a message.
I can't have lunch.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.707
How about dinner?
No.

08:35.710 --> 08:37.075
Drinks later?
No.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.548
Why not?
Because.

08:38.549 --> 08:40.700
You say so much
with so little.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.371
I'm sorry, will. This
really not a good time.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.518
Well, that sums up
our entire marriage.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.488
Can you please leave
before I throw something?

08:47.490 --> 08:51.779
I've missed you. No one
berates me the way you do.

08:51.790 --> 08:53.326
How long are you
in town for?

08:53.330 --> 08:54.684
I don't know yet.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.623
I want to sell
the house.

08:56.630 --> 09:00.191
It's the last remaining
detail of your divorce.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.634
Our divorce.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.836
Heh. Yeah.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.299
When can we discuss it?

09:07.310 --> 09:08.630
Before I leave.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.234
I promise you
I'll call you.

09:12.850 --> 09:15.171
I'll hold you to it.

09:52.090 --> 09:54.957
[dog barking]

10:01.630 --> 10:03.928
[footstep]

10:21.780 --> 10:23.316
Hey, pam.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.173
Clay.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.589
What are you
doing here?

10:25.590 --> 10:27.615
Heh. Came to see you.

10:27.620 --> 10:31.511
You didn't answer any
of my calls this morning.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.282
I was busy.
Heh.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.927
What do you want,
clay?

10:34.930 --> 10:36.853
The obvious--
to talk,

10:36.870 --> 10:39.293
To tell you
my side of things.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.529
You got me all wrong.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.339
This whole thing is
SO many ways of wrong.

10:43.340 --> 10:44.830
This is not the time
or the place.

10:44.840 --> 10:48.731
Oh., Is this not
a convenient time for you?

10:48.740 --> 10:50.208
I'm sorry.
You ruined my life.

10:50.210 --> 10:53.646
Maybe I should schedule
another time for us to discuss it.

10:53.650 --> 10:54.879
There are ways to deal
with things, clay.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.510
Yeah, that's right, and I
choose direct confrontation.

10:58.520 --> 11:00.887
You need to leave, or
I'm gonna call the cops.

11:00.890 --> 11:02.654
You ain't doing
anything.

11:02.660 --> 11:05.186
Ohh! Unh! Unh!

11:05.190 --> 11:07.329
No! Get off!

11:07.330 --> 11:10.152
Pam!
Aah!

11:10.170 --> 11:11.695
Pam!

11:11.700 --> 11:12.565
Ugh!

11:12.570 --> 11:13.822
[pam whimpering]

11:13.840 --> 11:15.433
Clay: Pam!

11:15.440 --> 11:17.238
Aah! Aah!
Pam!

11:17.240 --> 11:19.959
Open the door!

11:27.880 --> 11:30.713
I just received a file
from the hollywood station.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.519
Pam tyler was accosted
outside of her home last night.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.285
That's my case.
I just met with her.

11:36.290 --> 11:37.189
Was it
the ex-husband?

11:37.190 --> 11:38.954
No, a co-worker,
who was apparently upset

11:38.960 --> 11:40.257
Over being fired.

11:40.260 --> 11:40.954
Who is he?

11:40.960 --> 11:42.189
Uh, his name is
clay adams.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.656
He was let go
from their accounting firm

11:43.670 --> 11:45.195
Last month
for sexual harassment.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.294
Pam works in hr.
She handled the case.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.394
But she's still being
threatened by her ex-husband?

11:49.400 --> 11:51.562
Yeah. She has a
restraining order against him,

11:51.570 --> 11:54.437
But this is
someone new.

11:55.010 --> 11:56.330
Clay: I wasn't trying
to hurt her.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.671
I just wanted to
talk with her.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.739
Then she got all
pushy and shovey, not me.

11:59.750 --> 12:02.173
<i>You think it was appropriate
to wait outside her house</i>

12:02.180 --> 12:03.272
To accost her?

12:03.290 --> 12:04.974
I wanted to talk
with her.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.549
I was not there
to accost her.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.813
You like pam?

12:08.820 --> 12:09.787
She's ok.

12:09.790 --> 12:11.588
You have romantic
feelings for her?

12:11.590 --> 12:13.854
No. I don't think
of pam like that.

12:13.860 --> 12:16.557
So you never left
gifts outside her house,

12:16.570 --> 12:17.594
Flowers or perfume?

12:17.600 --> 12:20.092
Are you kidding? That
woman got me fired.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.090
So you hold
a grudge?

12:21.100 --> 12:23.740
No. No.
Not a grudge.

12:23.740 --> 12:25.139
A--a grievance.

12:25.140 --> 12:26.369
I--I like to
joke around.

12:26.370 --> 12:32.150
I made a comment about a
female co-worker's appearance.

12:32.150 --> 12:34.244
You sexually
harassed her.

12:34.250 --> 12:37.140
Man, people are
so touchy these days.

12:37.150 --> 12:40.586
Ok. Look. I didn't
harass anyone.

12:40.590 --> 12:44.185
I complimented
a co-worker

12:44.190 --> 12:49.253
On her perfectly
proportional...Chest.

12:49.260 --> 12:52.093
This whole thing is
a misunderstanding.

12:52.100 --> 12:54.296
Honestly, if anything,
I'm--I'm guilty

12:54.300 --> 12:57.497
Of having a bad sense of
humor, not sexual harassment.

12:57.510 --> 12:58.534
Any priors?
No.

12:58.540 --> 12:59.530
He's just a creep.

12:59.540 --> 13:01.338
Jack: What about
boundaries?

13:01.340 --> 13:03.672
Was that your ex-husband
that stopped by yesterday?

13:03.680 --> 13:05.808
That would be him.

13:05.810 --> 13:08.245
So you're
on good terms.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.173
He seems to think so.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.373
Clay: I was upset.

13:11.390 --> 13:12.812
Pam put that on record.

13:12.820 --> 13:14.743
Ok. That's gonna
follow me forever.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.057
She ruined my career.

13:16.060 --> 13:17.186
Well, maybe it
should be ruined.

13:17.190 --> 13:18.919
According to pam,
you also groped yourself

13:18.930 --> 13:20.329
In front of the
female co-workers.

13:20.330 --> 13:21.627
I bought
the wrong size briefs.

13:21.630 --> 13:24.122
They were tight.
I couldn't breathe.

13:24.130 --> 13:25.894
Why does everybody think
the worst about me?

13:25.900 --> 13:29.029
Because you're
kind of creepy.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.292
No one will hire me

13:30.310 --> 13:32.563
Unless pam files
a new hr report,

13:32.570 --> 13:33.503
But she won't do that

13:33.510 --> 13:35.171
Because she's holier
than god

13:35.180 --> 13:36.773
With her female
empowerment crap.

13:36.780 --> 13:38.839
I get it. She got
burned by her husband.

13:38.850 --> 13:40.705
Everybody knows about it.
She doesn't need to

13:40.720 --> 13:42.472
Take it out on me.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.744
Jack: I spoke with clay.
He's upset about being fired,

13:44.750 --> 13:46.582
And he's directing
all his anger at you.

13:46.590 --> 13:48.854
Why? All I did was
follow company policy.

13:48.860 --> 13:51.420
He feels mistreated,
misunderstood.

13:51.430 --> 13:52.420
He's blaming you.

13:52.430 --> 13:53.659
He did this
to himself.

13:53.660 --> 13:55.082
Did he admit to
sending the champagne?

13:55.100 --> 13:57.250
No. He seems too angry
for a peace offering.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.900
That requires a skill set
he doesn't possess.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.096
So it's my
ex-husband darren.

14:03.100 --> 14:04.238
Have you talked
to him yet?

14:04.240 --> 14:05.765
We're in the process
of locating him now.

14:05.770 --> 14:07.238
Your ex is definitely
a more viable suspect,

14:07.240 --> 14:09.470
But I wouldn't rule out
another visit from clay.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.335
I'd also advise you
to file a tro,

14:11.350 --> 14:13.569
Maybe invest
in an alarm system,

14:13.580 --> 14:14.877
A few cameras
on the property.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.348
In other words,
spend money.

14:16.350 --> 14:17.749
This is such
an inconvenience.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.514
It's more than
an inconvenience.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.488
It's your life.

14:25.560 --> 14:29.497
So two of pam's
neighbors saw

14:29.500 --> 14:31.423
A gray challenger
in the neighborhood

14:31.430 --> 14:33.125
On two different
occasions.

14:33.130 --> 14:35.189
There are a lot
of gray cars.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.292
What makes you think
it was me?

14:36.300 --> 14:37.461
Darren, we're
beyond that.

14:37.470 --> 14:38.960
We'll pull
the city cameras,

14:38.970 --> 14:39.960
We'll place you there.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.972
Why are you stalking
your ex-wife?

14:48.180 --> 14:49.773
Pam broke up with you.

14:49.780 --> 14:51.270
She divorced you.

14:51.290 --> 14:56.319
You're angry,
yet you still love her.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.459
Love, hurt, anger--

14:58.460 --> 15:01.122
It's a volatile
combination.

15:01.130 --> 15:03.519
Pam's house is
on my way home.

15:03.530 --> 15:04.793
Yeah. I sometimes
drive by.

15:04.800 --> 15:07.622
Which makes it easy to
stop off and leave her gifts.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.130
Gifts are an expression
of love.

15:09.140 --> 15:10.130
You admit
to leaving them?

15:10.140 --> 15:12.632
No. That would mean
I broke my tro,

15:12.640 --> 15:14.005
And you could
arrest me.

15:14.010 --> 15:14.932
I will not admit
to that.

15:14.940 --> 15:16.601
Darren, if you really
care about pam,

15:16.610 --> 15:18.305
You'll leave her alone.

15:18.310 --> 15:21.177
So it should be all that
you want if you love her.

15:21.180 --> 15:24.639
Look. I know things didn't
end well with me and pam.

15:24.650 --> 15:26.209
I said and did
a lot of things,

15:26.220 --> 15:28.188
Mostly because
I was hurt,

15:28.190 --> 15:29.453
But I'm better now.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.383
I'm trying to
move on.

15:31.390 --> 15:33.449
And we should believe
you why?

15:33.460 --> 15:34.882
When pam filed
that restraining order,

15:34.900 --> 15:36.322
It hit me pretty hard.

15:36.330 --> 15:39.630
I realized that I had a
problem, so I got help.

15:39.630 --> 15:40.927
What kind of help?

15:40.940 --> 15:43.989
I joined a love and sex
addicts support group.

15:44.010 --> 15:47.036
I go to meetings.
They've helped me.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.099
I understand why
I need to feel love

15:49.110 --> 15:50.976
And why I obsess
when I don't get it.

15:50.980 --> 15:52.778
It's helped manage
my behavior.

15:52.780 --> 15:55.147
You mean your obsession.

15:57.350 --> 15:59.887
I fear abandonment
and loneliness.

15:59.890 --> 16:03.918
I always have. It
causes me to act out.

16:03.930 --> 16:06.149
I'm working on it.

16:10.930 --> 16:12.125
Vicky.

16:12.130 --> 16:13.359
Sorry for
the surprise visit.

16:13.370 --> 16:15.532
Do you have a minute? Of course.

16:15.540 --> 16:18.134
So when they asked me to
come to |.A. To fill in for you,

16:18.140 --> 16:21.906
I said yes because I wanted
to look in on an old case

16:21.910 --> 16:22.934
From 5 years ago.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.170
5 years ago?
You had left tau already.

16:25.180 --> 16:28.400
Yeah.
It's complicated.

16:29.350 --> 16:31.671
Stan gardner.
That's before my time.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.112
I wasn't there yet.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.009
Yeah.
Love obsession case.

16:35.020 --> 16:37.250
Uh, stan's wife
had left him,

16:37.260 --> 16:38.580
Was seeing
other men,

16:38.590 --> 16:40.285
And he couldn't
take it.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.620
He confronted her
one night,

16:41.630 --> 16:42.552
A fight ensued,

16:42.560 --> 16:43.755
And he
strangled her.

16:43.770 --> 16:44.794
Was he convicted?

16:44.800 --> 16:46.768
Yes. He claimed
he was with a friend.

16:46.770 --> 16:48.192
Is that barry newly?

16:48.200 --> 16:49.690
Yes, who had his own
trouble with the law

16:49.700 --> 16:52.408
And couldn't be found
to verify stan's alibi.

16:52.410 --> 16:54.401
Stan's dna,
fingerprints, everything

16:54.410 --> 16:57.402
Were found
at the crime scene.

16:57.410 --> 16:58.229
What can I do?

16:58.250 --> 16:59.342
Well, barry has
resurfaced.

16:59.350 --> 17:01.409
Now he's corroborating
stan's alibi,

17:01.420 --> 17:02.819
Says they were
together all night

17:02.820 --> 17:04.049
The night
of the murder.

17:04.050 --> 17:05.449
Why now? Why didn't
he come forward before?

17:05.450 --> 17:07.714
Because what they were
doing was selling drugs.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.212
The judge has said that he'll
look at the case next week.

17:10.230 --> 17:13.222
Stan's entire conviction
could be overturned.

17:13.230 --> 17:17.155
Yes, but it means that there
is still a murder to be solved.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.797
So we pass it
to homicide.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.928
Not yet.

17:20.940 --> 17:25.194
I just would really appreciate
your fresh eyes on it

17:25.210 --> 17:28.464
Just to get an
objective opinion.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.209
Of course.

17:30.210 --> 17:32.201
Thank you.

19:34.970 --> 19:37.359
[creaking]

19:41.240 --> 19:43.129
Aah! Aah!

19:43.140 --> 19:45.973
Agh! Unh!

19:45.980 --> 19:47.675
Unh!

19:56.760 --> 19:59.183
Aah! Aah!

20:00.790 --> 20:02.895
[screaming]

20:02.900 --> 20:04.652
Help me, somebody!

20:04.670 --> 20:07.321
Oh, god!
Oh, god!

20:11.510 --> 20:13.137
Thanks
for the update.

20:13.140 --> 20:14.539
How's pam?
She suffered

20:14.540 --> 20:16.008
A superficial stab
wounds to the chest,

20:16.010 --> 20:17.739
But the e.R. Docs
say she was lucky.

20:17.750 --> 20:18.774
No vital organs
were hit.

20:18.780 --> 20:20.179
She'll be
released soon.

20:20.180 --> 20:21.670
Clay adams, our
disgruntled co-worker has

20:21.680 --> 20:22.909
An alibi for last night.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.275
He was at a bar.
10 people confirmed it.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.689
Pam was attacked
with this letter opener.

20:26.690 --> 20:27.885
I saw several others
just like it

20:27.890 --> 20:29.187
On a table
in the kitchen.

20:29.190 --> 20:30.612
And one of her bedroom
windows was jimmied.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.155
Her attacker broke
in while she was gone

20:32.160 --> 20:33.480
And waited
for her to get home.

20:33.490 --> 20:35.857
[tires squeal]

20:37.970 --> 20:39.927
Sir, stop.
This is a crime scene.

20:39.930 --> 20:40.920
Get off me.
Let me in.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.760
This is my
ex-wife's house.

20:42.770 --> 20:44.989
Get off me! It's
my ex-wife in there!

20:45.010 --> 20:46.500
Jack: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. Hey.

20:46.510 --> 20:47.807
You can't go
in there.

20:47.810 --> 20:48.709
It's ok, guys.

20:48.710 --> 20:50.508
I need to see pam.
Is she ok?

20:50.510 --> 20:51.773
Has something
happened? Please tell me.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.339
That's what we're
trying to find out.

20:53.350 --> 20:55.739
Why don't you tell us
where you were last night

20:55.750 --> 20:58.879
I was out, having
a meal with friends.

20:58.890 --> 21:00.312
We're gonna need
names.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.287
Wanda and rachel.

21:01.290 --> 21:02.382
That's all I know.

21:02.390 --> 21:03.653
We don't use
last names in group.

21:03.660 --> 21:05.116
Is this the sex and love
addicts group

21:05.130 --> 21:06.120
You were talking about?

21:06.130 --> 21:07.427
Yeah. A few of us
got together

21:07.430 --> 21:08.955
For a bite at the
diner across the street

21:08.960 --> 21:09.995
After our
9:00 meeting.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.923
How do we find this
wanda and rachel?

21:11.930 --> 21:13.261
There's a meeting
letter today

21:13.270 --> 21:17.093
At the sunset community
art center in hollywood.

21:19.010 --> 21:20.409
Jack: So they know
we're coming?

21:20.410 --> 21:22.629
I spoke with the coordinator
at the main branch.

21:22.640 --> 21:23.778
It's quite an operation.

21:23.780 --> 21:25.179
They have over
100 meetings daily

21:25.180 --> 21:26.375
In |.A. County alone.

21:26.380 --> 21:27.404
Lots of sex addicts.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.239
And love addicts.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.649
There's help
for everyone.

21:29.650 --> 21:31.539
Might be good for you. Easy.

21:31.550 --> 21:33.848
Why do they lump
sex and love together?

21:33.860 --> 21:37.216
Cynic. It's about the rush
that comes with sex and love.

21:37.230 --> 21:40.154
The effects of dopamine on
the brain are similar to cocaine.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.719
So love really
is a drug.

21:41.730 --> 21:42.822
The addict is driven
to re-create

21:42.830 --> 21:44.252
The pleasurable feelings
of sex and love

21:44.270 --> 21:46.329
Over and over at the
expense of their relationships.

21:46.330 --> 21:48.526
Always searching for
that high is addictive,

21:48.540 --> 21:52.192
All that serotonin,
oxytosin, phenylethylamine

21:52.210 --> 21:53.530
Running through the brain.

21:53.540 --> 21:56.669
You know way
too much about this.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.978
Yeah.

21:58.980 --> 21:59.879
Man: And at night,

21:59.880 --> 22:01.507
I fight the urge
to call her,

22:01.520 --> 22:03.943
To e-mail her,
to drive by her house,

22:03.950 --> 22:05.918
And in my head,
I know that I've idealized

22:05.920 --> 22:08.946
Our whole relationship,
I've created

22:08.960 --> 22:10.758
This fantasy in my mind

22:10.760 --> 22:13.183
That bears no resemblance
to reality,

22:13.190 --> 22:16.353
And yet the desire
is there,

22:16.360 --> 22:17.430
Stronger than ever.

22:17.430 --> 22:20.161
So I go out,
and try to re-create something

22:20.170 --> 22:21.262
That never existed,

22:21.270 --> 22:23.238
But each sexual conquest
leaves me only feeling

22:23.240 --> 22:24.890
More alone,
leaves me feeling

22:24.910 --> 22:28.039
Isolated from the world
around me.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.771
You know, so then
I come here,

22:30.780 --> 22:35.308
And suddenly,
I don't--I don't feel alone.

22:39.790 --> 22:44.216
Janice: Hi. We're looking
for rachel or wanda.

22:47.460 --> 22:48.621
Are you rachel?

22:48.630 --> 22:50.951
Wanda. Rachel's
not here today.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.722
Detective larsen,
lawrence.

22:52.730 --> 22:55.427
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.498
See you later.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.332
We need to confirm
the whereabouts

22:58.340 --> 23:01.002
He said he was
with you last night.

23:01.010 --> 23:01.932
That's right.

23:01.940 --> 23:03.499
Uh, rachel and I took
him out to dinner

23:03.510 --> 23:04.830
Right after the meeting.

23:04.850 --> 23:06.500
What time did
you leave?

23:06.510 --> 23:08.069
About 11:30.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.115
Darren had to work early.

23:09.120 --> 23:10.110
How well do you
know darren?

23:10.120 --> 23:12.384
He's a member
of my home group.

23:12.390 --> 23:15.985
I've been in recovery
a little over a month.

23:15.990 --> 23:18.015
Thank you for
speaking with us.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.328
Uh, go easy on darren.

23:20.330 --> 23:21.957
He's had a rough time.

23:21.960 --> 23:22.927
How do you mean?

23:22.930 --> 23:24.420
His wife cheated on him,

23:24.430 --> 23:25.522
Broke his heart.

23:25.530 --> 23:28.625
He's had a hard time
getting over the betrayal.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.597
Thank you.

23:31.670 --> 23:34.059
Pam: It's not true.
I never cheated on darren.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.036
But I don't get it.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.439
You--you told him
that you did.

23:36.440 --> 23:39.034
I'd just found out the man
I loved was a sex addict,

23:39.050 --> 23:41.246
Was sleeping
with multiple partners.

23:41.250 --> 23:42.479
So you were trying
to hurt him?

23:42.480 --> 23:44.869
I was angry. I said some
things in the moment.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.380
What does it matter?

23:46.390 --> 23:47.710
Darren has an alibi.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.085
Is there anybody
else you haven't

23:49.090 --> 23:50.558
Told us about,
anyone?

23:50.560 --> 23:53.860
There hasn't been
anyone since darren.

23:53.860 --> 23:56.090
Who else
could it be?

23:58.870 --> 24:01.862
[music playing
on headphones]

24:41.210 --> 24:43.201
[splash]

24:56.320 --> 24:58.084
[sighs]

25:13.640 --> 25:15.267
Apparently clay adams
was jogging,

25:15.280 --> 25:17.078
And someone hit him
in the head with a rock.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.708
Only some homeless guy
who swears he's brad pitt.

25:19.710 --> 25:20.939
What did
the doctors say?

25:20.950 --> 25:22.748
They're waiting for his
brain swelling to subside.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.275
They have no idea
when he'll wake up

25:24.290 --> 25:25.849
Or if he'll be able
to remember anything.

25:25.850 --> 25:27.249
What about
the surveillance cameras?

25:27.260 --> 25:28.546
Working on those
right now.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.483
Well, who whoever
attacked clay took a huge risk.

25:30.490 --> 25:31.685
I mean, a public
park in full view

25:31.690 --> 25:33.180
Of anyone who
happened to be walking by.

25:33.190 --> 25:35.727
Well, that means that the
attacker was either angry

25:35.730 --> 25:37.255
Or saw clay
as a threat.

25:37.270 --> 25:38.749
My money's
on darren.

25:38.770 --> 25:39.589
Clay threatened pam.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.863
Maybe he's still
being protective.

25:40.870 --> 25:42.429
According to the security
at darren's office,

25:42.440 --> 25:43.965
He used his key card
to exit the building

25:43.970 --> 25:45.233
A little after 5 p.M.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.129
Which gives him plenty
of time to get to the park

25:47.140 --> 25:50.474
I'll check
on the surveillance video.

25:52.550 --> 25:55.042
Hey! What are you
doing here?

25:55.050 --> 25:56.939
I'm here to see vicky.

25:56.950 --> 25:58.111
You back to work?

25:58.120 --> 25:59.315
Not quite yet.

25:59.320 --> 26:00.446
So when?

26:00.450 --> 26:02.487
You miss me?

26:02.490 --> 26:03.889
Maybe.

26:03.890 --> 26:04.960
You miss me?

26:04.960 --> 26:06.655
Of course not.

26:06.660 --> 26:08.287
When you making
me dinner?

26:08.300 --> 26:10.155
Oh, I'm cooking now?

26:10.160 --> 26:11.798
Yeah.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.492
[knock knock knock]

26:17.510 --> 26:20.730
Hey.

26:20.740 --> 26:23.209
I looked over the case.

26:23.210 --> 26:24.177
And?

26:24.180 --> 26:26.877
I think I know
why you asked me to.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.076
You want
an objective opinion.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.572
Unbiased, yes.

26:32.950 --> 26:34.918
I think stan gardner's
innocent.

26:34.920 --> 26:38.481
His alibi checks out,
and barry newly is legit.

26:38.490 --> 26:40.549
Newly hasn't seen stan
in 5 years.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.028
He qualified his alibi
word for word.

26:42.030 --> 26:44.727
I think he's got a real shot
at overturning his conviction.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.289
So when stan
is cleared

26:46.300 --> 26:48.723
And the case is
reopened,

26:48.740 --> 26:52.904
Where would you
begin your investigation?

26:53.570 --> 26:59.976
Vicky, I think you know that I
would start where you would start--

27:01.250 --> 27:03.742
With your ex-husband.

27:07.920 --> 27:09.684
He was sleeping
with the victim,

27:09.690 --> 27:11.112
And if it wasn't
her husband stan,

27:11.130 --> 27:15.283
Then it was the man she
was having an affair with.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.950
You were his alibi.

27:16.960 --> 27:19.668
In your deposition,
you said that

27:19.670 --> 27:22.560
He was home all night,
you two got into an argument,

27:22.570 --> 27:24.732
And then he went upstairs
to watch tv.

27:24.740 --> 27:26.469
You stayed downstairs
in the kitchen,

27:26.470 --> 27:28.029
Working at the counter.

27:28.040 --> 27:30.429
Yes.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.135
This alibi is complete?

27:32.150 --> 27:33.174
There's no holes in it?

27:33.180 --> 27:35.103
I would never lie
fro that man.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.714
I believe you,
or you wouldn't be here,

27:37.720 --> 27:39.984
But you must have
some doubt.

27:39.990 --> 27:42.186
Things were not good
between us.

27:42.190 --> 27:44.716
He was sleeping
in the guest room,

27:44.730 --> 27:46.220
<i>And 1--I could hear
the by,</i>

27:46.230 --> 27:50.155
But I did not physically
see him until the morning.

27:50.160 --> 27:54.063
_ I read that
in your statement.

27:54.070 --> 27:56.562
You're not
SO sure Nnow.

28:01.840 --> 28:05.105
He's your husband,
and you know him,

28:05.110 --> 28:07.545
But is he capable
of murder?

28:07.550 --> 28:09.575
I don't know.

28:09.580 --> 28:11.241
Janice: Surveillance
footage is in.

28:11.250 --> 28:12.513
So there's clay.

28:12.520 --> 28:15.945
According to the report,
the attack took place here.

28:20.260 --> 28:22.524
That's where he
picked up the rock.

28:22.530 --> 28:23.850
We never get a clear
look at the attacker.

28:23.860 --> 28:25.692
He looks to be the same
height and weight as darren.

28:25.700 --> 28:29.091
We're gonna need evidence
if we want to get a warrant.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.234
There.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.459
You see that?
Sports car?

28:34.480 --> 28:37.609
It's gray. Darren
drives a gray challenger.

28:37.610 --> 28:39.749
I can't make out
the license plate.

28:39.750 --> 28:42.606
Let me see if I can
zoom in.

28:44.380 --> 28:45.609
Can you run it?

28:45.620 --> 28:47.884
Doing it right now.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.383
We got him.
Nice.

29:09.440 --> 29:13.843
Darren tyler,
open up. Lapd.

29:18.250 --> 29:19.979
[beep]

29:37.340 --> 29:39.934
Jack, over here!

29:46.380 --> 29:48.007
It's pam.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.512
Some kind of shrine
to their relationship.

29:50.520 --> 29:55.048
Looks like he put it up
and then took it down.

30:05.170 --> 30:06.057
He knows he's sick.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.890
He's trying to cure
his obsession

30:07.900 --> 30:08.992
By going to meetings.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.070
He's more than
obsessed.

30:10.070 --> 30:11.299
He's bipolar,
but it's untreated.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.369
Antipsychotics
from 6 months ago--

30:13.370 --> 30:14.531
Full bottle.

30:14.540 --> 30:15.803
Pam said he wasn't
right in the head,

30:15.810 --> 30:17.278
But she never
mentioned mental illness.

30:17.280 --> 30:20.079
Darren could have kept it
from her, source of shame.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.105
I keep mine a secret.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.316
Sorry. Bad joke.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.742
He's already turned
violent.

30:25.750 --> 30:27.240
What he's done here,
these photos,

30:27.250 --> 30:30.515
He doesn't know whether
to love her or to hate her.

30:30.520 --> 30:32.386
Or hurt her.

30:32.390 --> 30:36.725
[bells toll]

30:37.760 --> 30:38.795
[sighs]

30:38.800 --> 30:39.961
Thanks, gary.
Tell everyone

30:39.970 --> 30:41.290
We'll meet
at the 6th street shelter

30:41.300 --> 30:43.029
Downtown tomorrow
at 7:00.

30:43.040 --> 30:46.499
Thanks, everyone.
I'll see you tomorrow.

31:24.810 --> 31:27.302
[door shuts]

31:27.310 --> 31:31.440
Hello? Father james?

32:03.920 --> 32:07.015
[man groaning]

32:12.890 --> 32:15.120
Father james?

32:25.910 --> 32:28.561
Oh, my god!
Father james!

32:30.480 --> 32:32.437
Father james?

32:34.050 --> 32:36.940
Darren: I didn't mean
to hurt him.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.589
He tried to stop
me, pam.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.480
I just wanted
to see you.

32:50.200 --> 32:53.921
Darren, what did you do?

33:02.740 --> 33:05.209
Any update on
darren tyler's location?

33:05.210 --> 33:06.541
Not yet. We tried
to ping his phone,

33:06.550 --> 33:07.779
But he must have
turned it off.

33:07.780 --> 33:09.100
We have a unit
outside his apartment

33:09.120 --> 33:10.770
And a bolo out
on his car.

33:10.780 --> 33:11.713
What about pam?

33:11.720 --> 33:15.213
I spoke to a neighbor, who
saw her leave her house alone

33:15.220 --> 33:16.483
Less than two hours ago.

33:16.490 --> 33:18.310
That was pam"s sister.
It's pam's day off.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.253
She said that pam
volunteers for a church group

33:20.260 --> 33:21.659
That feeds the homeless.

33:21.660 --> 33:22.684
Which church?

33:22.700 --> 33:23.599
St. Julia's.

33:23.600 --> 33:26.467
We should get
over there.

33:26.470 --> 33:28.199
I came to see you.

33:28.200 --> 33:31.363
I've wronged you, pam.

33:31.370 --> 33:33.065
I know that.

33:33.070 --> 33:34.868
That's why I sent
those gifts.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.837
That was my way
of saying, "I'm sorry."

33:36.840 --> 33:38.604
Darren.

33:38.610 --> 33:41.580
I need you to know
how sorry I am.

33:41.580 --> 33:43.048
Darren, stop!

33:43.050 --> 33:45.109
I must take
responsibility.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.610
That's what they
teach us in group,

33:46.620 --> 33:48.019
That we are all
responsible

33:48.020 --> 33:50.512
For what happens
in our lives.

33:54.630 --> 33:56.621
[tires squealing]

33:59.230 --> 34:01.324
Janice: That's
darren's car!

34:01.340 --> 34:03.229
Call for backup!

34:03.240 --> 34:04.560
This is detective
janice lawrence

34:04.570 --> 34:08.063
Requesting backup
at st. Julia's on gower.

34:15.250 --> 34:16.775
Darren, let's talk.

34:16.780 --> 34:19.750
Put the candle down.

34:19.750 --> 34:20.649
Unh!

34:20.650 --> 34:22.539
Hey! No! Unh!

34:22.560 --> 34:24.585
Aah! Pam!

34:24.590 --> 34:26.284
Wait!

34:27.530 --> 34:29.418
Wait!

34:31.100 --> 34:32.454
Go find detective lawrence.

34:32.469 --> 34:34.620
Put your hands
in the air.

34:37.969 --> 34:40.337
I said put them up.

34:42.139 --> 34:43.072
Do it.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.105
I'm done.

34:45.110 --> 34:47.147
Shoot me.

34:47.850 --> 34:50.012
Get on your knees.

35:05.830 --> 35:08.094
Hyah!

35:08.100 --> 35:09.659
Unh! Ohh! Agh!

35:09.670 --> 35:11.661
Unh!

35:11.670 --> 35:13.434
Agh! Ohh!

35:13.440 --> 35:15.260
[crying]

35:15.280 --> 35:18.238
You got him?
Yep.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.548
Come on.
On your feet.

35:25.350 --> 35:27.990
Officer: All right.
Come on. Let's go.

35:27.990 --> 35:32.279
Were you aware he'd stopped
taking his antipsychotics?

35:32.290 --> 35:33.849
I never knew he was
taking them.

35:33.860 --> 35:35.419
He never told me.

35:35.430 --> 35:36.454
I asked, but...

35:36.460 --> 35:37.552
He was sick, pam.

35:37.560 --> 35:39.119
I never knew
how bad it was.

35:39.130 --> 35:43.397
Sex addiction, self-mutilation,
even stalking you,

35:43.400 --> 35:45.368
He was self-medicating.

35:45.370 --> 35:47.304
But he was never
gonna hurt me.

35:47.310 --> 35:49.733
I thought he would,
but I was wrong.

35:49.740 --> 35:52.573
He was never
gonna hurt me.

36:05.860 --> 36:07.487
We caught
the bad guy.

36:07.490 --> 36:09.652
Time to go home.

36:09.660 --> 36:11.355
In a minute.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.498
Everything all right?

36:13.500 --> 36:18.529
Yeah. I'm good. I'll
see you tomorrow.

36:23.010 --> 36:24.478
Man: da da

36:24.480 --> 36:29.702
I just can't get you
out of my head

36:29.720 --> 36:30.744
Thanks
for meeting me.

36:30.750 --> 36:32.275
I'm surprised
you called.

36:32.290 --> 36:33.644
Why are you surprised?
I said I would.

36:33.650 --> 36:36.039
Maybe because we haven't
seen much of each other

36:36.060 --> 36:40.657
I always think it's because
you remember just the bad stuff.

36:40.660 --> 36:48.568
Besides, I believe that people
can change if they really want to.

36:48.570 --> 36:49.969
I've tried.

36:49.970 --> 36:51.233
And you
certainly have.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.538
Look at you. You're
an fbi agent now.

36:53.540 --> 36:55.929
So--thank you--

36:55.940 --> 36:58.932
Why exactly
are you here?

36:58.950 --> 37:00.975
This and that.

37:00.980 --> 37:03.677
It's about that woman
who runs your old unit.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.546
I read about her.

37:05.550 --> 37:07.484
Crazy story.

37:07.490 --> 37:12.417
Oh, there's still some
fallout and other cases.

37:12.430 --> 37:15.559
Hey. Did you hear
about stan gardner?

37:18.030 --> 37:20.124
There's a name
I haven't heard in a while.

37:20.130 --> 37:22.599
A judge has agreed
to reopen his case.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.591
His conviction
may be overturned.

37:24.610 --> 37:25.600
Seriously? Why?

37:25.610 --> 37:26.839
A witness
has emerged.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.707
Heh. It's been
5 years.

37:29.710 --> 37:30.780
Who's this witness?

37:30.780 --> 37:32.930
I don't know, but
apparently, it checks out.

37:32.950 --> 37:34.406
Stan could walk.

37:34.410 --> 37:38.278
Is that what you're
doing here?

37:38.290 --> 37:40.645
If stan was
innocent,

37:40.650 --> 37:42.186
Then I screwed up.

37:42.190 --> 37:45.160
The murderer's
still out there.

37:46.730 --> 37:48.858
[cell phone vibrates]

37:52.100 --> 37:54.728
Work?

37:54.740 --> 37:55.525
Yeah.
Hmm.

37:55.540 --> 37:57.736
I'm sorry. Can I
take a rain check?

37:57.740 --> 37:59.595
Of course.

37:59.610 --> 38:02.659
Da da

38:06.650 --> 38:09.574
da da da

38:09.580 --> 38:10.445
Hey.

38:10.450 --> 38:13.283
I know it's late, but I
wanted to check on you,

38:13.290 --> 38:14.542
See how you're
doing.

38:14.550 --> 38:16.587
If I knew you were coming,
I would have cooked.

38:16.590 --> 38:19.514
Hmm. I'll settle
for a beer.

38:19.530 --> 38:22.227
That I can do.
How was your day?

38:22.230 --> 38:24.392
You know, it's weird
not having you around,

38:24.400 --> 38:26.619
Telling me
what to do.

38:27.200 --> 38:30.465
You having
a problem with vicky?

38:30.470 --> 38:31.733
She's good, jack.

38:31.740 --> 38:34.232
But she's not you.

38:37.340 --> 38:40.469
You're not coming
back, are you?

38:43.950 --> 38:45.839
Why would you
say that?

38:45.850 --> 38:49.548
My instinct would
be to run, take off,

38:49.560 --> 38:52.712
Go somewhere
and start over,

38:52.730 --> 38:54.687
Become someone new.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.759
That is what
you did, jack.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.489
Except I didn't
run away.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.298
I ran to something--

39:00.300 --> 39:01.165
My son--

39:01.170 --> 39:05.596
And I got a new life
in the process.

39:05.610 --> 39:08.307
What would you be
running to?

39:09.740 --> 39:11.731
I don't know.

39:12.710 --> 39:14.974
I guess I just have
to figure out

39:14.980 --> 39:17.415
What the next chapter is

39:17.420 --> 39:19.514
In my life
and then--

39:19.520 --> 39:22.842
Well, and then start
living it.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.555
Hmm.

39:26.060 --> 39:28.927
Well, it would be
nice if...

39:28.930 --> 39:33.197
I was a part of
that next chapter.

39:33.200 --> 39:37.296
Set me free

39:40.640 --> 39:45.601
stay forever and ever

39:48.010 --> 39:50.069
I just can't

39:50.080 --> 39:53.687
get you out of my head

39:58.090 --> 39:59.580
I got your message.

39:59.590 --> 40:00.728
Sorry to make you
come back,

40:00.730 --> 40:02.084
But I think
I have something.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.352
No worries.
What's up?

40:03.360 --> 40:04.759
Well, it all started with
something that pam said

40:04.770 --> 40:06.727
About how darren
would never hurt her,

40:06.730 --> 40:08.619
So I started to
wonder who did

40:08.640 --> 40:09.698
Attack pam
in her house?

40:09.700 --> 40:11.589
Right because both
darren and clay adams

40:11.610 --> 40:12.691
Had alibis
for that night.

40:12.710 --> 40:15.031
Correct, which got me
thinking about the m.O.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.530
The attacker jimmied
the window,

40:16.540 --> 40:18.508
Found the weapon
inside the house,

40:18.510 --> 40:19.705
Then laid in wait
for his victim,

40:19.710 --> 40:22.042
Which is the exact
m.O. Of the killer

40:22.050 --> 40:23.916
In this case.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.445
Francine johnson.

40:25.450 --> 40:27.418
She was murdered
in her home,

40:27.420 --> 40:29.980
The killer jimmied
the window,

40:29.990 --> 40:31.583
Took a knife
from the kitchen,

40:31.590 --> 40:34.389
Stabbed francine
in the chest.

40:34.390 --> 40:36.654
So you think these
two cases may be related?

40:36.660 --> 40:38.424
There's more than
just two.

40:38.430 --> 40:40.819
I found 4 murders
with the same m.O.,

40:40.830 --> 40:44.266
And in each case,
the victim had been stalked

40:44.270 --> 40:45.396
Before she was murdered.

40:45.410 --> 40:47.208
So how can you tie
these victims together?

40:47.210 --> 40:50.737
I can't, but I can tie
their stalkers together.

40:50.740 --> 40:53.448
Darren tyler,
john murray--

40:53.450 --> 40:59.469
Had a stalker who attended a love
and sex addiction support group.

40:59.490 --> 41:03.017
So we've got a
serial killer out there.
