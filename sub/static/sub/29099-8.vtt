"Sandie Shaw"
Closed captioned

00:12.447 --> 00:14.927
I'm sorry about your
husband, Mrs. Thwaite.

00:14.971 --> 00:16.842
Let's put the past
behind us, Mrs. Gaunt.

00:16.886 --> 00:18.496
Let's show the world
what can be done

00:18.540 --> 00:20.846
when two women reason together.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.546
Do you like parties, Martha?

00:27.810 --> 00:29.333
MARTHA: You need to go get your sister away from that man.

00:29.377 --> 00:30.508
He's in league
with the devil.

00:30.552 --> 00:31.814
I mean, really he is.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.729
How did you two

00:33.772 --> 00:35.296
end up working together?

00:35.339 --> 00:36.645
We're not with
the No-Name League.

00:36.688 --> 00:37.820
CROWLEY:
Next you'll tell me

00:37.863 --> 00:40.170
you're not spying on them
for the CIA.

00:40.214 --> 00:43.043
What do you want, Crowley?I want your soul, of course.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.963
MARTHA: Thomas, will you please tell us what happened?

00:51.007 --> 00:53.444
We were never there.
You understand?

00:53.488 --> 00:55.838
My God. James.

00:55.881 --> 00:57.231
Hello, Frances.

00:57.274 --> 00:58.406
I thought you were dead.

00:58.449 --> 00:59.842
When the time is right,

00:59.885 --> 01:02.149
I shall reveal myself publicly.

01:02.192 --> 01:05.021
And then I will destroy
my enemies

01:05.065 --> 01:06.718
and lead this country back
to greatness.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.590
The Raven Society

01:08.633 --> 01:12.159
is on the cusp
of a new dawn.

01:12.202 --> 01:14.204
It'll shock the world.

01:14.248 --> 01:16.119
Are you with me?!

01:16.163 --> 01:18.121
Yes, yes, yes!

01:19.340 --> 01:20.471
Will you marry me?

01:20.515 --> 01:21.690
Yes.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.126
Yes, I will.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.522
Esme!

01:27.565 --> 01:29.698
ALFRED:
Captain Curzon,

01:29.741 --> 01:30.742
he has been waiting,

01:30.786 --> 01:31.830
waiting all this time

01:31.874 --> 01:32.831
to pay me back.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.833
Anything?

01:37.836 --> 01:39.273
MRS. PIKE:
I don't even know
his first name.

01:39.316 --> 01:40.665
Just clean his house,
that's all.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.189
Have you any idea
where he's gone?

01:45.627 --> 01:47.455
You're supposed to be dead.Well, I'm not.

02:30.715 --> 02:33.196
How's your mum?

02:33.240 --> 02:34.850
All right.

02:34.893 --> 02:36.721
I like your mum.

02:36.765 --> 02:39.071
Why aren't you dead?

02:39.115 --> 02:40.725
It's a good trick, eh?

02:40.769 --> 02:42.336
I'd tell you how,
but I'd have

02:42.379 --> 02:47.297
to implicate other parties,
so I'll say nowt.

02:47.341 --> 02:50.213
Tell me why I shouldn't give
the old bill a shout.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.954
Why would you?

02:51.997 --> 02:54.391
I've done nothing to you.

02:54.435 --> 02:56.828
Recently.

02:56.872 --> 02:58.613
Why are you here?

02:58.656 --> 03:00.354
How did you know about Curzon?

03:00.397 --> 03:03.313
I've got important friends, me.

03:03.357 --> 03:05.968
And you're the talk
of the town, you two.

03:06.011 --> 03:09.276
Why? Curzon's a nobody.

03:09.319 --> 03:11.713
Nobody's nobody.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.758
Why'd he kill Esme?

03:15.934 --> 03:18.154
To get at me.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.766
Revenge. He thinks
I disrespected him.

03:21.810 --> 03:25.248
Oh, I see.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.207
It were your fault, then.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.817
Thought as much.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.862
Why else would anyone hurt

03:30.906 --> 03:34.388
such a lovely, innocent
lass like her?

03:34.431 --> 03:37.565
What did you do
to disrespect him?

03:37.608 --> 03:40.002
What's any of this got to do
with you?

03:40.045 --> 03:42.613
I just want justice for Esme,
same as you.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.051
I loved her.

03:46.095 --> 03:49.098
You barely knew her.

03:49.141 --> 03:51.056
She was my fiancée.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.972
I dare say you were
very fond of her.

03:54.016 --> 03:56.018
A man's love's not the same,
though, is it?

03:56.061 --> 03:58.325
You've less
feeling in you.

03:58.368 --> 04:01.066
Any road,

04:01.110 --> 04:04.113
our lad's away,
pointing no fingers.

04:05.723 --> 04:08.335
We have to catch
the bugger again.

04:08.378 --> 04:09.858
Best team up, eh?

04:09.901 --> 04:13.644
I'm gonna go now.

04:13.688 --> 04:16.821
Have I done somewhat
to offend you somehow?

04:16.865 --> 04:20.085
No. You're mad, that's all.

04:20.129 --> 04:21.739
Don't be like that.

04:21.783 --> 04:23.306
We could help each other.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.787
Good-bye.He weren't alone.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.181
He were with a woman.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.968
How do you know that?

04:33.011 --> 04:35.318
I were there.

04:35.362 --> 04:38.713
Came to see Esme.

04:38.756 --> 04:41.193
They got to the door first.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.718
Well, what did
this woman look like?

04:43.761 --> 04:47.069
Older lady.

04:47.112 --> 04:48.766
Dark hair, I think.

04:48.810 --> 04:50.942
She were wrapped up.

04:50.986 --> 04:54.729
They let 'emselves in so quick
I couldn't get a proper look.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.908
I could've stopped 'em
if I'd known.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.912
They let themselves in?

05:03.955 --> 05:05.043
Wh-- Th-They had keys?

05:06.175 --> 05:08.177
Big ring of 'em.

05:09.178 --> 05:10.745
Where you going?

05:10.788 --> 05:13.356
The keys, they gave you
a clue, didn't they?

05:13.400 --> 05:15.010
Tell.

05:15.053 --> 05:17.055
No.

05:17.099 --> 05:18.100
I'm coming with
you, Sherlock.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.449
No. You're not.

05:19.493 --> 05:22.931
If you loved Esme
as much as I do...

05:22.974 --> 05:25.455
you won't deny me.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.896
You'll know how much
this means to me.

06:14.286 --> 06:16.332
For fuck's sake,
why'd you do that?

06:16.376 --> 06:18.943
Emotions got the better
of me. Sorry.

06:18.987 --> 06:20.902
Walk away.

06:22.860 --> 06:24.253
Now, let's have a look.

06:26.168 --> 06:28.039
Oh, it's not too bad.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.998
Now let's start
again, shall we?

06:30.041 --> 06:32.130
You gave over
the keys. Why?

06:32.174 --> 06:33.958
W-We do it all the time.

06:34.002 --> 06:36.178
There are other flats
in the building to be let.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.658
He looked like
a respectable buyer.

06:37.701 --> 06:39.007
It-it's normal procedure.

06:39.050 --> 06:41.575
When you heard
about Esme's murder,

06:41.618 --> 06:42.880
why didn't you say
anything to the police?

06:42.924 --> 06:45.405
I called the police immediately!

06:45.448 --> 06:48.538
T-Two detectives came,
and I gave them

06:48.582 --> 06:50.148
a full description
of the man

06:50.192 --> 06:53.064
and-and all the relevant
paperwork. Look, I swear.

06:55.284 --> 06:58.287
The police knew.

06:58.330 --> 06:59.810
Coppers.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.769
Bent as Judas,
the lot of 'em.

07:01.812 --> 07:03.553
Leave me alone now,
would you?

07:03.597 --> 07:06.382
Don't take your grump
out on me, duck.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.384
I'm not the enemy.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.864
What we gonna do now?

07:09.907 --> 07:12.170
We never see
each other again.

08:13.318 --> 08:15.146
PRIME MINISTER:
There's a telephone number
you can call for information

08:15.190 --> 08:17.279
about bloody trains
and parking.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.542
Is this too much?
Hmm?

08:19.586 --> 08:21.544
Oh, uh, no.
It's very fetching, ma'am.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.067
But this...
No.

08:23.111 --> 08:24.504
No. I think it's too much.

08:26.157 --> 08:29.813
Ma'am, this is
a serious problem.

08:29.857 --> 08:32.686
None of these secret
political societies

08:32.729 --> 08:34.862
have ever dared show
their faces in public before.

08:34.905 --> 08:39.301
This is a brazen show
of disrespect.

08:39.344 --> 08:40.694
THE QUEEN:
What a dreary poster.

08:40.737 --> 08:43.871
How on earth does Mrs. Gaunt
expect to draw a crowd?

08:43.914 --> 08:45.829
Mm, there'll be a crowd.

08:45.873 --> 08:48.440
A mob.
Screaming for blood.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.965
Or a general election,
at least,

08:51.008 --> 08:52.749
which would come
to the same thing.

08:52.793 --> 08:57.275
A hung parliament, martial law,
blood and anarchy, ma'am.

08:57.319 --> 09:01.584
You should write plays,
Prime Minister. So dramatic.

09:01.628 --> 09:04.282
No.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.588
No, it won't do.

09:05.632 --> 09:06.850
I do not exaggerate.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.591
Anarchy.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.375
The whole country
will be watching

09:10.419 --> 09:11.681
to see how we respond.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.378
We don't oppose order

09:13.422 --> 09:16.991
or strength
or new dawns, do we?

09:17.034 --> 09:19.646
I don't understand
what it is they want.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.865
Ooh, they're not Republicans,
are they?

09:21.909 --> 09:23.650
Oh, Lord, no.

09:23.693 --> 09:26.696
No, traditional
English fascists.

09:26.740 --> 09:29.873
Smart black uniforms,
thrash Johnny Foreigner,

09:29.917 --> 09:32.876
hang free thinkers
sort of thing. Childish stuff,

09:32.920 --> 09:34.922
but they're willing
to destroy half the country

09:34.965 --> 09:36.706
to get what they want.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.708
A national cleansing in blood
would be just the ticket.

09:38.752 --> 09:40.710
But under Royal authority.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.625
Yes, of course.

09:42.669 --> 09:46.629
But you'd have
to follow their orders

09:46.673 --> 09:50.067
or be forced into abdication.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.463
The Duke of Windermere
would be very happy

09:54.506 --> 09:56.770
to take your place.I believe I told you

09:56.813 --> 09:58.685
we shan't ever speak
of my wretched uncle.

09:58.728 --> 10:01.513
As you say, madam.
Nevertheless...Absurd.

10:01.557 --> 10:04.386
The people would never stand
for it.

10:04.429 --> 10:06.736
Mustard and coral,
have you gone stark mad, woman?

10:09.696 --> 10:12.394
I want your permission to use
the harshest available methods

10:12.437 --> 10:14.439
to crush this rally.

10:14.483 --> 10:17.660
Water cannon and rubber bullets,
deployed with brisk discretion.

10:17.704 --> 10:21.272
Perhaps one or two snipers
in reserve.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.100
Won't that make me look
awfully oppressive?

10:23.144 --> 10:24.972
Can't we just send in
those lovely horses?

10:25.015 --> 10:26.103
Isn't that the usual style?

10:27.714 --> 10:30.412
Well, we shall do that,
of course.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.980
But we must do more.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.677
In times of strife,
the people need

10:34.721 --> 10:37.158
to see and feel
the firm guidance

10:37.201 --> 10:39.464
of Your Majesty's
government.
No.

10:39.508 --> 10:41.684
I won't be goaded
into brutality.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.556
Horses and truncheons only.

10:44.600 --> 10:47.124
No rubber bullets.
No cannon, no snipers.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.737
Yes, ma'am.

10:55.002 --> 10:58.048
If I may...
That's all.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.675
UNDINE:
A public rally?

11:15.718 --> 11:18.025
We had a pact.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.943
I thought we understood
each other.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.727
Why is she doing this?

11:24.771 --> 11:26.294
Puzzling.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.383
What can she say
or do at a public rally

11:28.426 --> 11:32.648
that warrants the risk
of arrest? I don't know.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.651
A reckless mistake, perhaps.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.784
You should be guardedly happy,
my dear.

11:37.827 --> 11:41.570
Well, she exposes herself,
she exposes us.

11:41.613 --> 11:44.486
We have to respond with
our own counterprotest,

11:44.529 --> 11:46.270
or the No-Name League
will look weak.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.881
I will look weak.

11:47.924 --> 11:52.146
If Mrs. Gaunt wants to bare
her neck, don't stop her.

11:52.189 --> 11:54.496
Let the police
do your work for you.

11:54.539 --> 11:57.368
Do nothing, you mean?

11:57.412 --> 12:00.371
If you sit down by the riverbank
and wait long enough,

12:00.415 --> 12:04.245
the corpses
of your enemies float past.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.637
Chinese proverb.

12:05.681 --> 12:08.075
We're not in China.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.076
Of course.

12:09.119 --> 12:11.600
I'm just a loyal advisor.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.689
You're the leader.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.430
You must decide.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.544
Big rally tomorrow in the park.

12:42.587 --> 12:46.243
Stand up for your country
and take part.

12:46.287 --> 12:51.118
Say no to peace
and say yes to battle. Eh?

12:51.161 --> 12:52.554
Are we not men?

12:52.597 --> 12:53.947
Shut it, Adolf.
The game's on.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.949
Oi, you! Off the furniture!
Sharpish.

12:55.992 --> 12:58.778
We are talking about
the future of England.

12:58.821 --> 12:59.909
Fuck off!

12:59.953 --> 13:01.781
Commie drunkards.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.130
You call yourself English?

13:03.173 --> 13:05.349
Fucking liberty.

13:05.393 --> 13:06.742
PATRON:
You're ruinin' the
fucking football, eh?

13:06.786 --> 13:09.223
PATRON 2:
Fuck off.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.007
Do you want some?Lads. Lads!

13:11.051 --> 13:13.531
Go on, then.
Do something.

13:13.575 --> 13:15.664
DAVEBOY:
You know,
I don't get politics.

13:15.707 --> 13:19.363
You're born, you're fucked,
you die.

13:19.407 --> 13:20.974
That's the name
of this ship.

13:21.017 --> 13:23.585
Why worry which fucker's
on the bridge?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.370
Alfie boy.

13:26.414 --> 13:30.548
Night of the murder,
Curzon had a woman with him.

13:30.592 --> 13:33.595
Description sounds like
that charlady, Mrs. Pike.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.205
What description?
How do you know that?

13:35.249 --> 13:37.294
Long story.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.166
We need to track her down.

13:39.209 --> 13:41.168
No problem. Ready.

13:41.211 --> 13:42.952
Well, finish your
pint. Let's go.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.736
What, now?

13:44.780 --> 13:47.348
What, we're-we're tracking
her down now? This minute?

13:47.391 --> 13:49.132
You're gonna track her down.
I've got other business.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.873
What business?

13:50.917 --> 13:54.268
The police fucked
Esme's murder investigation.

13:54.311 --> 13:56.183
It was a cover-up.Why?

13:56.226 --> 13:58.663
Don't know.
I'm going to ask a policeman.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.230
You two, find Pike.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.510
Goddamn it.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.905
You're nervous.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.994
Of course I am.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.996
I haven't the faintest doubt
that you'll be marvelous,

14:27.040 --> 14:28.650
your speech will
be spellbinding,

14:28.693 --> 14:30.782
and the rally will
be a great success.

14:30.826 --> 14:32.001
Yes.

14:32.045 --> 14:34.264
Or the Tower.

14:34.308 --> 14:37.311
Success. Destiny.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.095
Well and good.

14:39.139 --> 14:41.141
A success.

14:41.184 --> 14:42.577
What then, Jimmy?

14:42.620 --> 14:44.274
Well, I think
I'll start

14:44.318 --> 14:46.711
by personally castrating
the prime minister

14:46.755 --> 14:48.539
and all his cronies.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.629
Then I'll put them out to starve
in the Aldgate gibbet.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.024
Jolly well deserved, I'm sure.

14:55.068 --> 14:58.810
But wouldn't mercy look
more statesmanlike, though,

14:58.854 --> 15:00.943
to the people
at large?
The people...

15:00.987 --> 15:02.423
love ferocity,

15:02.466 --> 15:04.555
and they love
a spectacle.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.601
I'll give them both.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.516
Christ.

15:08.559 --> 15:11.432
It's all
a bit daunting, isn't it?

15:11.475 --> 15:14.000
I mean, we're-we're
starting a civil war.

15:14.043 --> 15:16.132
Steel yourself, Frances.

15:16.176 --> 15:19.614
Make no mistake,
I come with a rod of correction.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.703
There must be bloodshed.

15:21.746 --> 15:23.313
There must be pain.

15:23.357 --> 15:26.403
That is how a new
and stronger nation is forged.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.406
Egg and omelets, old girl.

15:29.450 --> 15:30.712
You know that.

15:30.755 --> 15:33.584
Yes. Yes, you're right,
of course.

15:33.628 --> 15:37.414
Sorry. Just a...
touch of the old butterflies.

15:37.458 --> 15:39.503
We shall fight... and win.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.812
What if the queen...

15:43.855 --> 15:45.814
refuses to accept our victory?

15:45.857 --> 15:48.338
Well... we'll
reason with her.

15:48.382 --> 15:50.297
She'll do the right thing.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.255
Wh-What if she doesn't?

15:53.387 --> 15:55.171
Then she knows that her uncle

15:55.215 --> 15:57.913
is waiting in the Bahamas,
anxious to come home.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.394
The pretender?

16:00.437 --> 16:01.569
Never.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.353
Never?

16:03.397 --> 16:06.400
Do you think?A coward

16:06.443 --> 16:08.706
who fled the war,
practically a traitor?

16:10.273 --> 16:11.405
Trifle harsh.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.233
He's no Alexander, but...

16:13.276 --> 16:16.062
He's married
to an American divorcée,

16:16.105 --> 16:17.411
and he wears jewelry.

16:17.454 --> 16:18.760
How can we talk

16:18.803 --> 16:20.283
about restoring virtue

16:20.327 --> 16:22.633
and allow such a man
on the throne?

16:24.157 --> 16:26.333
Perhaps you're right.

16:28.552 --> 16:30.815
No. You areright.

16:30.859 --> 16:32.992
No doubt.

16:35.559 --> 16:38.214
In any case...

16:38.258 --> 16:41.522
the mere threat of the man is
useful to us, don't you see?

16:41.565 --> 16:44.003
The queen doesn't know
we won't countenance the man.

16:46.962 --> 16:49.182
Here am I, talking
about the queen's business.

16:49.225 --> 16:50.748
Absurd.

16:50.792 --> 16:54.056
I can hardly write
a decent sentence.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.134
Terrible habit.

17:28.177 --> 17:31.659
Smoking?Sneaking up on people.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.835
It's uncivilized.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.185
Hard to break old habits.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.231
And it strongly suggests
this conversation

17:38.274 --> 17:39.797
will not be amiable.

17:39.841 --> 17:41.843
That's your guilty
conscience talking.

17:41.886 --> 17:44.019
Conscience?
You flatter me.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.021
You know why I'm here.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.502
Not the faintest, old chap.

17:49.981 --> 17:53.072
You-- and by "you,"
I mean the police--

17:53.115 --> 17:56.423
you knew who killed Esme,
and you covered it up.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.120
A very serious accusation.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.817
Skip the bollocks. Talk.

18:00.949 --> 18:02.559
Supposing what you say is true.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.735
I wasn't on Esme's case--
why do you assume

18:04.779 --> 18:06.128
I know anything about it?

18:06.172 --> 18:08.609
You know everything.
It's your job.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.915
Flattery again.

18:10.959 --> 18:13.179
I'm not happy,
Mr. Aziz.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.789
I'm not happy at all.

18:14.832 --> 18:16.660
Was you to play ignorant,

18:16.704 --> 18:19.185
I can't be responsible
for my actions.

18:19.228 --> 18:20.751
Are you threatening me?

18:20.795 --> 18:22.449
Yeah. I am.

18:24.842 --> 18:26.931
Just wanted to be clear
on that point.

18:26.975 --> 18:29.020
I'd hate to capitulate
too early.

18:31.284 --> 18:33.503
Uh, bravo on cracking
the case, by the way,

18:33.547 --> 18:35.853
Someday you must tell me
how you did it.

18:37.290 --> 18:40.119
It's the usual sordid story.

18:40.162 --> 18:42.991
Esme's killer, Mr. Curzon,
is the bastard son

18:43.034 --> 18:44.819
of a very important man.

18:44.862 --> 18:46.386
A lord, in fact.

18:46.429 --> 18:50.041
Favors were called in;
the case was scuppered.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.392
What lord? Give me a name.

18:52.435 --> 18:53.871
Oh.

18:53.915 --> 18:56.004
That's more
than my life's worth.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.353
Literally.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.530
Cut my throat, if you must.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.493
Tell me where Curzon is now.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.190
I don't know.

19:08.234 --> 19:11.498
Like I said, Mr. Aziz,
I'm not happy.

19:11.541 --> 19:13.369
I'll make trouble.

19:13.413 --> 19:15.066
Bulls in china shops
ain't in it.I don't know

19:15.110 --> 19:16.894
where your man is.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.940
I expect
I could find out, though,

19:18.983 --> 19:20.942
if you gave me some time.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.248
I haven't got time.

19:22.291 --> 19:24.032
You could put
the Sweeney onto me

19:24.075 --> 19:25.686
as soon as I walk out there.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.122
Yes, I could do that.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.472
You'll have to trust me.

19:31.561 --> 19:33.824
You got 24 hours.

19:35.913 --> 19:38.481
Well, I'd better
get onto it, then.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.440
Now, how should I reach you?

19:46.315 --> 19:48.926
Fuck.

19:48.970 --> 19:50.928
If you ask me, they're
all bloody lunatics.

19:50.972 --> 19:53.235
Ravens, indeed.
They're crows, more like.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.368
Disgruntled crows.
You give them their head,

19:55.411 --> 19:57.848
they'll have us
back at war in a trice,

19:57.892 --> 19:59.633
never mind who with.Hear, hear.

19:59.676 --> 20:01.069
I hope you're gonna give 'em
a bloody good thrashing

20:01.112 --> 20:02.636
at this wretched rally.

20:02.679 --> 20:05.073
Don't you worry,
we'll show them what's what.

20:05.116 --> 20:08.424
Rather them than that
wretched No-Name League, eh?

20:08.468 --> 20:09.512
Hmm.

20:09.556 --> 20:10.905
At least the Ravens have

20:10.948 --> 20:12.211
proper respect for rank...

20:12.254 --> 20:13.212
and blood.

20:13.255 --> 20:15.170
A plague on both their houses.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.477
What's the matter with
just muddling along together

20:17.520 --> 20:19.261
as we always have done?

20:19.305 --> 20:21.089
PRIME MINISTER:
Hear, hear.Built an empire that way.

20:21.132 --> 20:23.309
Gentry, plebs,
muddling and...

20:23.352 --> 20:25.876
bodging along together.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.965
Arthur.Sir.

20:29.663 --> 20:32.927
Arthur's been with me here
nigh on...

20:32.970 --> 20:34.537
20 years.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.539
We couldn't live
without each other.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.019
Am I right, Arthur?

20:38.062 --> 20:39.716
No doubt,
Sir Francis.

20:39.760 --> 20:40.978
What is it?

20:41.022 --> 20:43.372
A telephone call
for the prime minister, sir.

20:43.416 --> 20:44.808
Oh.

20:44.852 --> 20:47.028
Excuse me, gentlemen.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.817
Yes?

20:56.516 --> 20:58.431
Yes, I'm...

20:58.474 --> 21:00.998
with him now, as it happens.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.698
No.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.268
No. Come here.

21:21.367 --> 21:24.283
Sit down, man.

21:24.326 --> 21:25.936
Sit down.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.722
Thank you, sir.

21:28.765 --> 21:31.594
I've told Lord Smytth
what's afoot,

21:31.638 --> 21:34.336
and I've assured him
you'll do your very best

21:34.380 --> 21:36.469
to resolve the
situation quietly.

21:36.512 --> 21:38.775
He quite rightly
wants to know

21:38.819 --> 21:42.039
why the situation
isn't resolved already.

21:42.083 --> 21:45.260
Yes, sir.
Uh, the vengeful young man

21:45.304 --> 21:49.003
pursuing your son is a highly
skilled SAS combat veteran.

21:49.046 --> 21:51.919
Hard to catch,
hard to kill.

21:53.224 --> 21:55.139
We can get him, sir, no doubt,

21:55.183 --> 21:56.402
but, um....

21:56.445 --> 21:58.447
it'll take some doing.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.449
At a high cost
in men and blood, perhaps.

22:00.493 --> 22:02.103
Oh, indeed, Prime Minister.

22:02.146 --> 22:03.496
A high cost.And then,

22:03.539 --> 22:06.325
I imagine, a good few
indiscreet mouths

22:06.368 --> 22:08.457
will need to be silenced,
I expect.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.024
Yes, sir.
That's usually the case.

22:10.067 --> 22:12.331
You needn't lay it on
so thick.

22:13.723 --> 22:16.160
I know I'll have
to pay for this.

22:16.204 --> 22:18.206
Get the thing done.

22:18.249 --> 22:20.077
Yes, my lord.

22:23.167 --> 22:25.213
I make no excuses for him.

22:25.256 --> 22:27.171
He's not right in the head.

22:27.215 --> 22:29.348
He never was.

22:29.391 --> 22:32.525
But no child of mine is going
to be hunted like an animal

22:32.568 --> 22:34.353
by a mere pleb.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.574
Whatever he
may have been accused of,

22:38.618 --> 22:42.012
he has noble blood in him.

22:42.056 --> 22:45.364
And blood... is blood.

22:45.407 --> 22:49.368
Oh, any father
would do the same.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.327
His mother...

22:52.371 --> 22:55.286
was the great love of my life.

22:56.592 --> 22:59.465
As for payment,
perish the thought.

22:59.508 --> 23:02.206
What are friends for?Humbug.

23:03.338 --> 23:05.427
What do you want?

23:05.471 --> 23:07.081
Goes without saying

23:07.124 --> 23:10.301
your splendidly loyal support
for me in the House

23:10.345 --> 23:12.521
has been most welcome.Essential, you mean.

23:12.565 --> 23:15.045
Mm, quite so.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.439
I should hate
to lose that support,

23:17.483 --> 23:19.093
for any reason,

23:19.136 --> 23:21.748
under anycircumstances.

23:25.882 --> 23:28.276
Protect my son,

23:28.319 --> 23:31.061
get rid of this SAS ruffian,

23:31.105 --> 23:33.412
and I promise you my vote.

23:35.675 --> 23:38.460
Under any circumstances.

23:40.984 --> 23:42.943
Your son is safe.

24:35.735 --> 24:37.258
WOMAN:
One, two, three. Testing.

25:04.851 --> 25:08.332
Martha, do you
know what time it is?

25:08.376 --> 25:10.552
I do.

25:10.596 --> 25:13.773
I figured you for
an early riser.

25:13.816 --> 25:15.601
What is this about?

25:17.733 --> 25:19.518
Just passing.

25:22.390 --> 25:24.087
Are you okay?

25:25.611 --> 25:26.960
Fine.

25:28.091 --> 25:30.311
Touch of the flu.

25:30.354 --> 25:33.836
You shouldn't stay
long. It's catching.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.012
I never catch stuff.

25:36.056 --> 25:38.188
What's the coffee situation?

25:39.320 --> 25:41.540
I'll call room service.

25:46.675 --> 25:49.809
So, the big Raven Society
rally today, huh?

25:49.852 --> 25:52.028
What are you guys
doing about it?

25:53.203 --> 25:54.553
Nothing.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.555
Undine Thwaite told everyone
to stay at home.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.948
No. Not those guys.

25:58.992 --> 26:00.254
You guys.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.256
CIA.

26:02.299 --> 26:04.563
Now, I'm guessing you're gonna
play a waiting game, but...

26:04.606 --> 26:06.129
I think that would be a mistake.

26:06.173 --> 26:07.957
The situation
could deteriorate fast.

26:08.001 --> 26:10.307
Look at me, Martha.

26:10.351 --> 26:12.614
I'm not CIA.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.485
I'm looking at you, Thomas,

26:14.529 --> 26:16.009
and I don't believe you.

26:16.052 --> 26:18.577
Well, I can't help with that.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.406
Anyhow, I'm here
to tell you

26:22.450 --> 26:24.713
that I'm okay with
the CIA thing.

26:24.757 --> 26:27.194
I didn't want you to think
it'd be a problem for me.

26:27.237 --> 26:28.587
So we can continue
working together.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.589
That's a whole other issue.

26:32.199 --> 26:34.723
Well, go on.

26:34.767 --> 26:36.595
Let's face it, Martha.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.248
I'm not CIA.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.642
But supposing I was...

26:40.686 --> 26:43.645
you're not really...
Agency material.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.168
The hell I'm not.

26:45.212 --> 26:46.909
Last week,

26:46.953 --> 26:48.694
whilst on
a three-day blackout drug spree,

26:48.737 --> 26:51.827
you mislaid my sister
at a satanist orgy.

26:51.871 --> 26:54.482
Just a tad bit unprofessional,
don't you think?

26:54.525 --> 26:56.789
You son of a bitch.
Unprofessional?

26:56.832 --> 26:58.573
Look at you.

26:58.617 --> 26:59.966
I have the flu.

27:00.009 --> 27:01.794
You're drowning in
scotch and pills,

27:01.837 --> 27:03.926
you haven't slept right in
ages, you've been crying,

27:03.970 --> 27:05.885
and you're the big-shot CIA man?

27:05.928 --> 27:07.974
Yeah, well,
if you're the benchmark,

27:08.017 --> 27:10.367
I think I can
measure up okay.

27:15.938 --> 27:18.462
I'm sorry.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.553
That was uncalled for.

27:22.597 --> 27:25.556
That's all right.

27:25.600 --> 27:28.864
Not in great shape
at the present.

27:28.908 --> 27:30.431
It's true.

27:30.474 --> 27:33.173
What happened to you
at Crowley's?

27:33.216 --> 27:35.218
Not up for discussion.

27:35.262 --> 27:37.133
You saw the Devil.

27:37.177 --> 27:39.266
No. No Devil.

27:39.309 --> 27:41.311
I did. I saw him.

27:41.355 --> 27:42.617
No, Martha, you imagined him.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.401
I wish.

27:46.839 --> 27:50.016
Crowley is a spooky guy.

27:51.931 --> 27:54.890
We both got spooked.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.500
Let's leave it at that,

27:56.544 --> 27:57.893
shall we?

27:57.937 --> 27:59.634
This coffee sucks.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.724
You want some scotch?

28:02.768 --> 28:04.683
Um...

28:05.814 --> 28:08.774
Yeah. Sure.

28:15.781 --> 28:16.912
Hello?

28:16.956 --> 28:18.914
AZIZ:
He's been gift-wrapped for you.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.742
Wapping Pumping Station.

28:20.786 --> 28:23.136
Come alone.

29:04.612 --> 29:06.788
You're up early.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.225
Work, Mum.

29:09.269 --> 29:11.271
You're up early, too.Yeah.

29:11.314 --> 29:14.317
Making breakfast
for your dad.

29:14.361 --> 29:15.754
He's up early, too.

29:15.797 --> 29:16.842
Yeah, work.

29:18.191 --> 29:20.584
Sir Francis has a function.

29:21.716 --> 29:23.544
My busy boys.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.243
Where are you going?

29:27.287 --> 29:28.897
West End.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.420
Meeting a client.

29:30.464 --> 29:32.683
Got time
for a bacon sandwich?

29:32.727 --> 29:34.337
Or boiled egg
and soldiers?

29:34.381 --> 29:35.686
No, Mum.

29:35.730 --> 29:37.471
Well, at least let me
give you a hug, then.

29:59.885 --> 30:00.842
Got to go.

30:00.886 --> 30:01.843
Don't want to be late.

30:01.887 --> 30:04.063
Well, you be careful.

30:04.106 --> 30:05.673
I love you, son.

31:45.642 --> 31:48.123
CURZON :
Help.

31:50.038 --> 31:51.953
Help!

32:34.474 --> 32:36.389
Who's there?

32:43.744 --> 32:46.225
Who is it?

32:47.356 --> 32:50.142
Pennyworth,

32:50.185 --> 32:51.882
is that you?

33:01.457 --> 33:03.894
Good morning.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.768
Good morning.

33:07.811 --> 33:09.683
We meet at last,

33:09.726 --> 33:11.859
as they say.

33:13.948 --> 33:16.429
Cat got your tongue?

33:17.734 --> 33:19.345
I thought,
when I finally met you,

33:19.388 --> 33:21.347
I'd have lots to say to you.

33:21.390 --> 33:23.784
Questions to ask.

33:23.827 --> 33:25.438
But now we're here,

33:25.481 --> 33:27.831
I've got nothing.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.398
You're nothing.

33:31.444 --> 33:34.055
You fool.

33:34.099 --> 33:35.970
You think you've won.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.233
Don't you?

33:38.277 --> 33:42.063
You really think a dirty,
stupid little pleb like you

33:42.107 --> 33:44.457
could outwit a man
of noble blood?

33:44.500 --> 33:46.676
Nah.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.939
I know there's no winning
this game.

33:48.983 --> 33:51.986
But you got to play to
the whistle, haven't you?

33:53.335 --> 33:55.250
Isn't that right,
Inspector Aziz?!

33:59.298 --> 34:01.213
You can show yourself.

34:02.344 --> 34:04.216
I've got no backup.

34:04.259 --> 34:05.260
You're safe.

34:05.304 --> 34:07.958
Come have a chat to me.

34:10.222 --> 34:12.093
I'm not a fucking idiot.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.356
I know a trap when I see one.

34:16.445 --> 34:17.794
AZIZ:
Why did you walk

34:17.838 --> 34:19.753
into it, then?

34:23.583 --> 34:25.106
I don't know.

34:25.150 --> 34:28.022
I think
I don't give a fuck anymore.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.371
AZIZ:
I'm sorry.

34:29.415 --> 34:31.373
Makes my job easier,
at any rate.

34:31.417 --> 34:33.810
I don't know about easy.

34:33.854 --> 34:35.073
You've got three men with you

34:35.116 --> 34:36.596
and another couple up there
in cover

34:36.639 --> 34:37.597
with sniper rifles.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.773
There and there.

34:39.816 --> 34:41.383
I bet I can kill
Curzon and one

34:41.427 --> 34:43.168
or two of your men
before you can kill me.

34:43.211 --> 34:44.952
I doubt that.

34:44.995 --> 34:47.041
Let's find out, shall we?

34:47.085 --> 34:48.129
Count to three.

34:48.173 --> 34:52.002
Shoot him now.

34:52.046 --> 34:53.178
Shoot him.AZIZ:
One moment, sir,

34:53.221 --> 34:55.136
please.

34:55.180 --> 34:58.835
I am genuinely sorry
for all this chicanery.

34:58.879 --> 35:00.881
His father has
political clout.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.492
You know
the rest.

35:03.536 --> 35:04.711
We have no choice.

35:04.754 --> 35:06.582
Who's "we"?
You and your conscience?

35:07.714 --> 35:09.672
My superiors have no choice.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.109
Therefore,
I have no choice.

35:11.152 --> 35:12.414
I understand.

35:12.458 --> 35:13.937
No hard feelings.

35:13.981 --> 35:15.069
Count to three.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.897
I told you
to shoot him, damn it.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.333
A direct bloody order.
Do you hear?

35:18.377 --> 35:19.465
Shut up!

35:20.857 --> 35:22.424
Listen,

35:22.468 --> 35:23.773
if you give me

35:23.817 --> 35:25.906
your word of honor
that you'll spare this man,

35:25.949 --> 35:27.560
I can let you escape,

35:27.603 --> 35:30.867
get out of
the country.

35:30.911 --> 35:31.912
What?

35:31.955 --> 35:33.957
That's not the fucking plan.

35:34.958 --> 35:36.003
Shoot him, man.
Shoot him!

35:36.046 --> 35:37.352
Quiet!

35:40.312 --> 35:42.183
That's very decent of you.

35:42.227 --> 35:43.924
Won't do, though.
He has to die.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.055
AZIZ:
Look at him!

35:45.099 --> 35:46.753
Sad little madman.

35:48.407 --> 35:49.625
Is he really worth your life?

35:49.669 --> 35:52.150
CURZON:
You wretched little insect.

35:52.193 --> 35:54.630
How dare you?
How dare you?!

35:54.674 --> 35:55.631
My father will
have you hung!

35:55.675 --> 35:56.893
Is he worth your life?

35:56.937 --> 35:58.156
No.

35:58.199 --> 36:00.984
He's not worth
anything.

36:01.028 --> 36:02.072
Not fair, is it?

36:02.116 --> 36:03.900
Count to three.

36:06.033 --> 36:07.991
Alfred, please.
I don't need to count to three.

36:08.035 --> 36:09.167
I just need
to raise my finger.

36:09.210 --> 36:10.951
Well, go ahead.
Raise your finger, then.

36:26.967 --> 36:28.447
Don't... you...

36:28.490 --> 36:29.274
dare.

36:29.317 --> 36:31.145
Drop your weapons.

36:32.015 --> 36:34.496
All of ya!

36:35.628 --> 36:36.585
Tell 'em.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.152
Do as she says.

36:51.687 --> 36:53.776
Glad to see me now,
aren't you, pet?

36:53.820 --> 36:56.431
Say I'm wrong.

37:09.096 --> 37:10.532
Stop looking.

37:10.576 --> 37:11.403
You said you had

37:11.446 --> 37:12.665
no backup.

37:12.708 --> 37:13.753
And I actually
believed you.

37:13.796 --> 37:14.754
Well played.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.103
Swear to God, Mr. Aziz,

37:16.146 --> 37:17.235
I didn't know she was here.

37:17.278 --> 37:18.975
Look at me.

37:20.150 --> 37:21.282
Who is she?

37:21.326 --> 37:23.589
Looks very familiar.Long story.

37:23.632 --> 37:24.981
You think we talk
'cause you can wait.

37:25.025 --> 37:26.069
Oi.

37:26.113 --> 37:27.636
I told you to wait.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.377
I only gave him
a few little jabs.

37:29.421 --> 37:30.639
Keep her away
from me.

37:31.684 --> 37:33.294
Big baby.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.775
Who's this, then?

37:35.818 --> 37:36.776
Who are you?

37:36.819 --> 37:37.777
I'm nobody.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.822
Nobody?

37:39.866 --> 37:41.650
Nobody? What are you
doing here, then?

37:41.694 --> 37:42.956
Tell the truth.

37:42.999 --> 37:44.784
Nanny! I'm his nanny!

37:48.527 --> 37:50.268
Is that right, duck?

37:50.311 --> 37:51.660
She's your nanny?

37:51.704 --> 37:53.532
Mm-hmm.

37:53.575 --> 37:54.794
I see, I see.

37:54.837 --> 37:56.839
You're one of them.

37:56.883 --> 37:59.407
Filthy bastards.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.191
Posh people.

38:01.235 --> 38:03.759
Perverts, the lot of 'em.

38:03.803 --> 38:05.195
It's a wonder
they reproduce.

38:05.239 --> 38:06.414
Get her away from me.

38:06.458 --> 38:07.589
She's mad!

38:07.633 --> 38:09.287
Mad?

38:09.330 --> 38:11.941
I'm calm as a
millpond, me!

38:11.985 --> 38:14.466
You ain't seen
nothing yet.

38:14.509 --> 38:16.337
Sorry,
there'll be no torture.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.469
Give over.

38:17.512 --> 38:19.079
We're not animals.

38:19.122 --> 38:20.080
Speak for yourself.

38:20.123 --> 38:21.255
I need to see him suffer.

38:22.387 --> 38:23.779
No.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.781
You're a soldier.

38:25.825 --> 38:28.175
Are you telling me
you've never had a go?

38:29.263 --> 38:31.134
I've done torture.

38:31.178 --> 38:32.614
For answers.

38:32.658 --> 38:34.355
To make people talk.

38:34.399 --> 38:36.183
This one's got
nothing to tell us.

38:36.226 --> 38:38.185
He's mental.

38:38.228 --> 38:39.229
He just needs to be dead.

38:39.273 --> 38:40.448
Oh, God. This isn't right.

38:40.492 --> 38:42.320
You owe me.

38:42.363 --> 38:43.930
You know you do.

38:45.192 --> 38:46.367
Give us ten minutes.

38:46.411 --> 38:48.369
You don't need to watch.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.110
Leave the room if
you're squeamish.

38:50.153 --> 38:52.286
No, I'm-I'm sorry.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.418
I'm-I'm sorry.

38:53.461 --> 38:54.854
I'm sick.
I know I am.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.986
I don't
deserve this!

38:58.553 --> 39:00.294
Do you not?

39:00.338 --> 39:02.427
How many other women
have you killed?

39:02.470 --> 39:04.080
Esme wasn't your first,

39:04.124 --> 39:05.517
was she?

39:07.432 --> 39:09.390
I can smell
darkness on you.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.784
I-I have a sickness.

39:11.827 --> 39:14.787
I-I swear, if you let me go,
I'll get treatment.

39:14.830 --> 39:15.875
My-my family will...

39:15.918 --> 39:16.919
Sorry, love.

39:20.401 --> 39:22.621
What the fuck?

39:22.664 --> 39:24.927
I have to say,
I'm very disappointed in you.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.494
Welcome to the club.

39:26.538 --> 39:29.062
I'm afraid this is gonna
create a lot of trouble.

39:29.105 --> 39:30.150
For all of us.

39:30.193 --> 39:33.327
Be seeing you, then.

39:40.856 --> 39:42.728
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:42.771 --> 39:45.992
it's my great honor
to introduce to you

39:46.035 --> 39:47.907
our speaker of the day,

39:47.950 --> 39:50.997
talking to you on the
subject of "A New Dawn,"

39:52.433 --> 39:55.523
pro tem leader
of the Raven Society,

39:55.567 --> 39:58.439
Dr. Frances Gaunt!

40:08.101 --> 40:11.452
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

40:11.496 --> 40:13.367
Citizens of England,

40:13.411 --> 40:16.109
I will talk
to you today

40:16.152 --> 40:19.895
about the future
of our country.

40:19.939 --> 40:22.420
This is a topic
around which has settled

40:22.463 --> 40:24.639
a unanimous gloom.

40:24.683 --> 40:26.902
All seem to agree

40:26.946 --> 40:30.340
that, if we're not destroyed
by atom bombs,

40:30.384 --> 40:32.995
we will be ruined by poverty

40:33.039 --> 40:34.562
and moral decay,

40:34.606 --> 40:37.086
by unemployment and mob rule

40:37.130 --> 40:39.654
and angry dissent.

40:39.698 --> 40:43.484
We are united
only in our pessimism!

40:43.528 --> 40:47.619
Today,
I will talk to you of hope.

40:47.662 --> 40:50.926
Hope and optimism

40:50.970 --> 40:53.146
and a glorious future.

40:53.189 --> 40:55.496
Some of you will laugh,

40:55.540 --> 40:58.325
as if I'm talking about fairies and unicorns.

41:01.284 --> 41:05.201
But no.
Hope is real and powerful.

41:05.245 --> 41:09.205
Once we have hope,
then courage and strength

41:09.249 --> 41:10.555
and discipline will follow.

41:10.598 --> 41:13.427
No trial cannot be endured.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.995
No battle cannot be won.

41:16.038 --> 41:18.476
Platitudes, you say.

41:18.519 --> 41:21.130
Empty rhetoric. No.

41:22.436 --> 41:25.047
I am not here to speak of hope.

41:25.091 --> 41:26.484
I am here to show you.

41:26.527 --> 41:28.398
I'm no leader,

41:28.442 --> 41:31.706
no visionary.
I'm a simple country doctor

41:31.750 --> 41:36.102
here only because a great man
was brought low.

41:36.145 --> 41:40.149
My predecessor in this post

41:40.193 --> 41:42.412
was Lord James Harwood.

41:42.456 --> 41:44.545
He was a man of heroic vision

41:44.589 --> 41:46.547
and boundless energy.

41:46.591 --> 41:49.158
A true patriot
and a man of destiny.

41:49.202 --> 41:52.335
So the powers that be
were afraid of him

41:52.379 --> 41:55.034
and ordered his destruction.

41:55.077 --> 41:57.427
They threw him into the Tower.

41:57.471 --> 42:00.169
They kept him in a metal box,

42:00.213 --> 42:03.433
four foot square, and tortured
him to the brink of death.

42:03.477 --> 42:06.045
They mutilated him horribly.

42:06.088 --> 42:08.874
And when he was
thoroughly broken,

42:08.917 --> 42:11.224
they threw him naked
into the streets,

42:11.267 --> 42:13.182
condemned to a living death,

42:13.226 --> 42:16.185
a crazed and crippled beggar.

42:18.318 --> 42:20.494
My friends,

42:20.538 --> 42:23.062
fellow citizens,

42:23.105 --> 42:26.021
I hereby formally announce

42:26.065 --> 42:29.155
my resignation as leader
of the Raven Society,

42:29.198 --> 42:31.853
effective immediately.

42:31.897 --> 42:34.595
Where the devil is she going
with this?

42:34.639 --> 42:38.860
But it is my great honor
to introduce

42:38.904 --> 42:40.514
our new leader,

42:40.558 --> 42:42.734
our guiding light,

42:42.777 --> 42:46.433
Lord James Harwood.

42:49.392 --> 42:51.307
MAN:
What's happening?

43:03.406 --> 43:04.799
What the fuck?

43:08.673 --> 43:10.022
Oh, my God.

43:10.065 --> 43:11.501
RIPPER:
There goes

43:11.545 --> 43:12.981
our truce.

43:13.025 --> 43:15.418
Wow.

43:15.462 --> 43:17.595
Guess you were right.

43:17.638 --> 43:19.945
Situation has
deteriorated fast.

43:21.511 --> 43:22.556
Doesn't he look handsome, eh?

43:22.600 --> 43:23.992
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.488
Hello, England.

43:51.759 --> 43:52.978
Harwood!

43:53.021 --> 43:55.502
Bravo!

43:57.156 --> 43:59.593
Read the Riot Act.
Send in the heavy brigade.

44:01.029 --> 44:02.378
Arrest him.

44:02.422 --> 44:04.990
Arrest everyone.

44:13.738 --> 44:17.219
You cannot imagine

44:17.263 --> 44:21.093
how good it is
to see you all here today.

44:21.136 --> 44:24.444
A beautiful sight.

44:24.487 --> 44:28.535
The same cannot be said for me,
I'm afraid.

44:30.406 --> 44:31.799
I hope

44:31.843 --> 44:34.367
that you will forgive my looks

44:34.410 --> 44:36.674
and listen to my message.

44:38.806 --> 44:42.897
A new dawn is coming,
my friends.

44:44.029 --> 44:45.770
A fresh start

44:45.813 --> 44:47.119
for all of us!

44:55.780 --> 44:57.303
HARWOOD:
I'm going to talk with you

44:57.346 --> 44:59.609
about the serious...

44:59.653 --> 45:02.351
...the serious problem
that is fa...

45:02.395 --> 45:03.483
POLICE CHIEF:
Our sovereign queen

45:03.526 --> 45:05.441
commands all persons
being assembled here

45:05.485 --> 45:06.704
to disperse

45:06.747 --> 45:09.315
and depart peacefully...

45:09.358 --> 45:11.404
...on penalties contained...

45:11.447 --> 45:13.754
...in the Riotous Assembly Act.

45:13.798 --> 45:15.974
MAN:
Close the door!

45:19.151 --> 45:20.239
Please, stay calm.

45:44.567 --> 45:46.569
Let's go!

45:59.844 --> 46:02.368
Stop!

46:08.722 --> 46:10.985
Officers of the law,

46:11.029 --> 46:12.857
this is England.

46:12.900 --> 46:14.815
You will respect

46:14.859 --> 46:18.427
our ancient rights
and liberties

46:18.471 --> 46:20.734
and stop this violence

46:20.778 --> 46:23.998
immediately!

46:26.261 --> 46:28.089
Stand down.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.503
Further violence was averted

46:50.546 --> 46:53.419
when the police allowed
the crowd to disperse

46:53.462 --> 46:56.422
peacefully to their homes
without arrest.

46:56.465 --> 46:58.467
As we continue the news...

46:58.511 --> 47:01.253
Double whiskey
and two aspirin, please, Sid.

47:01.296 --> 47:03.211
Got it.

47:03.255 --> 47:05.431
You'll never guess
who was on the telly.

47:05.474 --> 47:07.825
I'll never guess.

47:07.868 --> 47:11.002
You look... pale, Alfie.

47:11.045 --> 47:12.307
You all right?

47:12.351 --> 47:15.136
Yeah, just a bit
of a headache, that's all.

47:15.180 --> 47:17.312
We looked
for that Mrs. Pike all over.

47:17.356 --> 47:19.445
Not hide nor hair.

47:20.576 --> 47:22.622
Yeah.

47:22.665 --> 47:25.059
Forget about all that. Sorted.

47:25.103 --> 47:27.279
Sorted? Curzon?

47:32.719 --> 47:34.634
SID:
You missed a prime show
on the telly, Alfie.

47:34.677 --> 47:37.028
High drama.

47:37.071 --> 47:38.986
Did I?

47:44.862 --> 47:46.733
See you later.

48:00.747 --> 48:01.966
MR. PENNYWORTH:
We'll not tell him anything.

48:03.097 --> 48:04.229
But...

48:04.272 --> 48:06.057
No. No, no, he'll make a fuss.

48:09.930 --> 48:11.540
You all right, Dad?Ah.

48:11.584 --> 48:12.977
Yeah, it's nothing.

48:13.020 --> 48:14.674
Bumped into a door.

48:15.936 --> 48:17.024
Clumsy so-and-so,

48:17.068 --> 48:18.852
he is.

48:20.941 --> 48:22.638
Where have you been?

48:22.682 --> 48:24.249
You don't look very well.

48:26.120 --> 48:28.079
Give us a hug, Mum.

48:28.122 --> 48:30.908
Oh, course.

48:33.736 --> 48:35.651
What about me, then?

48:37.088 --> 48:38.480
You're in a good mood.

48:38.524 --> 48:39.873
Why not?

48:39.917 --> 48:41.266
Today was a good day.

48:41.309 --> 48:42.702
If you say so.

48:42.745 --> 48:44.182
And tomorrow...

48:44.225 --> 48:46.967
tomorrow will be even better.

48:47.011 --> 48:48.577
I hope you're right.

48:48.621 --> 48:49.970
I know I am, son.

48:50.014 --> 48:52.277
I know I am.

48:52.320 --> 48:53.974
We've had a rough go of it,

48:54.018 --> 48:56.585
you know, all in all.

48:56.629 --> 48:58.587
But things are
gonna change now.

49:01.025 --> 49:03.331
Well, Prime Minister,

49:03.375 --> 49:04.985
that didn't go
very well, did it?

49:05.029 --> 49:07.335
No, ma'am. It did not.

49:07.379 --> 49:08.989
I could swear you told
me Harwood was dead

49:09.033 --> 49:10.730
months and months ago.

49:10.773 --> 49:13.124
"As good as dead," ma'am.

49:13.167 --> 49:15.735
"As good as," I said.

49:15.778 --> 49:18.781
Says here
Harwood's a national sensation,

49:18.825 --> 49:20.218
a hero,

49:20.261 --> 49:22.611
darling
of the disaffected masses.

49:22.655 --> 49:24.613
Says he defied
the police by

49:24.657 --> 49:28.922
"sheer force
of his commanding authority."

49:28.966 --> 49:32.360
Well, perhaps with water cannon
and rubber bullets,

49:32.404 --> 49:33.883
something might have been done.

49:33.927 --> 49:36.016
Oh, it's my fault, is it?

49:36.060 --> 49:37.670
Certainly not, madam.

49:37.713 --> 49:40.586
I-I merely point out
the mitigating circumstances.

49:40.629 --> 49:44.024
In any case, thrash the bugger
in Trafalgar Square.

49:44.068 --> 49:47.506
Make an example.Well, I would
that were possible.

49:47.549 --> 49:49.203
He's far too high-profile.

49:49.247 --> 49:52.119
Detain him now,
we'll have a tiger by the tail.

49:52.163 --> 49:54.252
The press
will scream blue murder.

49:54.295 --> 49:56.645
There'll be angry mobs in the
street howling for his liberty.

49:56.689 --> 49:58.560
Well, what are we
going to do, then?

49:58.604 --> 50:01.607
I don't know, Your Majesty.

50:01.650 --> 50:03.565
You'd better think
of something

50:03.609 --> 50:05.437
bloody fast.

50:07.482 --> 50:08.657
I got it!Got it?

50:08.701 --> 50:10.877
Yes. Ha. Oh, again?Hey! Bravo.

50:10.920 --> 50:13.184
Oh, I've got it! I've got it!

50:13.227 --> 50:16.317
Oh, what did I... what
did I tell you, Frances?

50:16.361 --> 50:17.536
I never doubted you.

50:17.579 --> 50:18.885
Oh, didn't you?

50:18.928 --> 50:20.408
Good girl. I-I've
got to confess

50:20.452 --> 50:22.106
I doubted myself.

50:22.149 --> 50:24.804
I'm just jolly lucky that
I'm not hanging in a dungeon.

50:24.847 --> 50:25.848
Hear, hear.

50:25.892 --> 50:27.154
Sir,

50:27.198 --> 50:28.242
your guests have arrived.

50:28.286 --> 50:29.722
Oh, uh, jolly good.

50:29.765 --> 50:31.680
They're a touch early. Will
you stall them a moment?

50:31.724 --> 50:32.942
Yes, Your Lordship.

50:32.986 --> 50:35.075
Guests?

50:35.119 --> 50:37.121
Yes.

50:37.164 --> 50:39.514
You see, the question
is, Frances, what now?

50:39.558 --> 50:41.647
Yes, indeed.

50:41.690 --> 50:44.128
See, I see power
within our grasp.

50:44.171 --> 50:46.260
And when that day comes,
some cold, hard decisions

50:46.304 --> 50:47.783
will have to be made.

50:47.827 --> 50:50.917
Some people will be with us,
and some against.

50:50.960 --> 50:52.614
I'm confident about
the army and the clergy,

50:52.658 --> 50:55.835
but Her Majesty the Queen...

50:55.878 --> 50:57.445
she troubles me.

50:57.489 --> 50:59.969
The queen?

51:00.013 --> 51:01.145
Well, I-I thought we were agreed

51:01.188 --> 51:02.624
she must be assured
of our loyalty.

51:02.668 --> 51:04.931
And we must be assured
of her obedience.

51:04.974 --> 51:07.847
Now, I know you're not keen
on going down this road,

51:07.890 --> 51:09.283
but I see no alternative.

51:09.327 --> 51:12.243
Down which road?

51:12.286 --> 51:15.202
You do trust me,
don't you, Frances?

51:15.246 --> 51:17.117
Yes, yes, of course I do.

51:17.161 --> 51:21.295
Well, if the queen should
prove to be reluctant,

51:21.339 --> 51:23.341
then we will need to find
an alternative.

51:23.384 --> 51:25.256
We will need to find
a replacement.

51:25.299 --> 51:28.085
SERVANT:
Their graces, the Duke and
Duchess of Windermere.

51:28.128 --> 51:29.260
Ah.

51:33.916 --> 51:36.267
HARWOOD:
Welcome, sir, ma'am.

51:36.310 --> 51:38.225
Welcome back to your lands.

51:57.375 --> 51:59.420
ALFRED:
Hello, Ez.

52:01.466 --> 52:03.859
Sorry I haven't visited
for a while.

52:07.602 --> 52:09.387
If you're there,
I expect you'll know

52:09.430 --> 52:11.432
that I killed the people who...

52:11.476 --> 52:13.391
Well, you know.

52:15.349 --> 52:17.569
Had to be done,
and now I've done it.

52:23.183 --> 52:25.838
You remember that first time
we went out?

52:28.232 --> 52:31.104
We were in the park,
listening to a brass band,

52:31.148 --> 52:32.584
and I made you laugh.

52:32.627 --> 52:35.282
And you looked at me
in my eyes,

52:35.326 --> 52:37.806
and you smiled at me.

52:37.850 --> 52:42.028
One of your proper
happy smiles.

52:42.071 --> 52:44.596
First one you ever gave me.

52:46.380 --> 52:49.296
I thought, fuck a duck,
she likes me.

52:51.472 --> 52:53.953
Best moment of my life,
that was.

52:53.996 --> 52:56.216
Best moment.

52:59.741 --> 53:03.571
Used to be that
that memory made me sad.

53:03.615 --> 53:07.140
I woke up this morning,
and I remembered it,

53:07.184 --> 53:10.317
and it didn't make me sad.

53:10.361 --> 53:13.712
I saw you smile at me.

53:16.280 --> 53:18.804
I sort of smiled back.

53:20.109 --> 53:23.025
So that's good, isn't it?

53:23.069 --> 53:25.332
Things are looking up.
