WEBVTT

00:01.976 --> 00:04.220
I didn't even know you could
fit a pine cone in there.

00:04.222 --> 00:05.464
Oh, you can fit it in,

00:05.466 --> 00:08.225
but only a medical
professional can get it out.

00:08.227 --> 00:11.446
Dr. Frost, Dr. Jacobs.
Any news about Eddie?

00:11.448 --> 00:12.925
Nothing yet, but you can rest assured,

00:12.927 --> 00:14.362
with Dr. Lewis as his surgeon,

00:14.364 --> 00:16.190
- he's in great hands.
- Meh.

00:18.559 --> 00:20.985
I just mean, does any
surgeon truly deserve

00:20.987 --> 00:22.021
to be called great?

00:22.023 --> 00:24.407
Cut, cut, snip, snip,
a little light sewing.

00:24.409 --> 00:26.374
The whole profession's
basic arts and crafts.

00:26.376 --> 00:29.333
- Yes, sir. But if we...
- But when a magazine

00:29.335 --> 00:32.336
makes a list of
California's sexiest doctors,

00:32.338 --> 00:36.514
you better believe it's surgeons
as far as the eye can see.

00:36.516 --> 00:39.343
I never should have
shown him that article.

00:39.345 --> 00:42.346
Hey, Mom. Any news?

00:42.348 --> 00:44.392
Nothing yet. And the
wait is driving me crazy.

00:44.394 --> 00:46.916
Hey, everyone. Hello, Jenny.

00:46.918 --> 00:48.700
Nice seeing you for
the first time today.

00:48.702 --> 00:50.702
Hmm. You look well.

00:50.704 --> 00:53.401
Ugh, enough. We all
know you're hooking up.

00:53.403 --> 00:55.968
- It's obvious.
- Yeah, you both leave at the same time

00:55.970 --> 00:58.235
and you show back up at the same time.

00:58.237 --> 00:59.297
Even I can tell.

00:59.299 --> 01:00.886
The little looks between you,

01:00.888 --> 01:03.436
the walks to the parking garage,
the texts on Jenny's phone.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.498
Mom.

01:04.501 --> 01:06.459
Well, you shouldn't just
leave it in your purse.

01:07.721 --> 01:10.026
Okay, great. You got us.

01:10.028 --> 01:11.229
This is happening.

01:11.231 --> 01:12.688
Okay, so what's happening?

01:12.690 --> 01:15.597
It's casual? It's very
casual? I's almost over?

01:15.599 --> 01:17.120
We're not labeling it, Mom.

01:17.122 --> 01:19.427
We're exploring, we're discovering.

01:19.429 --> 01:21.429
Ugh, I'm sorry I asked. That's plenty.

01:22.519 --> 01:24.910
Everyone.

01:24.912 --> 01:27.173
I'm just realizing that Dr.
Kenney probably expects me

01:27.175 --> 01:29.437
to deliver this news
with balloons or confetti,

01:29.439 --> 01:31.239
but the transplant was a success.

01:31.241 --> 01:32.741
Oh! Thank goodness!

01:32.743 --> 01:34.961
- Oh, my God. You are a miracle worker.
- Oh.

01:34.963 --> 01:37.825
An absolute miracle worker.
You just saved a man's life.

01:37.827 --> 01:40.125
Can you believe that?
I bet you're jazzed.

01:40.127 --> 01:41.187
Are you jazzed?

01:41.189 --> 01:42.841
I suppose I'm a little jazzed.

01:42.843 --> 01:45.580
Well, you should be. This man
deserves a pat on the back.

01:45.582 --> 01:47.672
- He is a hero.
- No, no, no. It's thanks to you

01:47.674 --> 01:49.457
that he made it to surgery at all.

01:49.459 --> 01:50.893
Dr. Lewis.

01:50.895 --> 01:53.880
I mean, well, that's a very
kind thing of you to say.

01:53.882 --> 01:55.724
I'm embarrassed. I don't even... I mean,

01:55.726 --> 01:57.856
- wow.
- I'm going back upstairs.

01:57.858 --> 01:59.028
Yes.

01:59.030 --> 02:00.204
Well, don't be a stranger.

02:00.206 --> 02:01.947
You're welcome back here any time.

02:01.949 --> 02:03.732
I mean, of course you
are. You work here.

02:03.734 --> 02:06.474
Okay, bye.

02:07.781 --> 02:09.126
Wow.

02:09.127 --> 02:12.152
You are deeply in love with that man.

02:12.154 --> 02:13.693
Oh, come on, stop it. Honestly.

02:13.695 --> 02:15.961
I'm just excited that Eddie is okay.

02:15.963 --> 02:18.007
Mm-hmm. Is Eddie the reason why you wore

02:18.009 --> 02:19.530
your favorite earrings today?

02:19.532 --> 02:22.405
I definitely noticed
those thirsty little hoops.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.414
Guys, lay off. There are
already enough barriers

02:26.416 --> 02:28.239
to love without the
fear of getting teased.

02:28.241 --> 02:31.107
Carol? I hope you find what we have.

02:31.109 --> 02:33.459
I liked this better
when it was a secret.

02:43.401 --> 02:44.705
Knock, knock.

02:44.707 --> 02:46.777
Eddie, oh, my gosh.

02:46.779 --> 02:48.064
You look great.

02:48.066 --> 02:49.666
Oh, I feel great, too.

02:49.668 --> 02:51.843
I'm thinking of replacing
more of my organs.

02:53.584 --> 02:55.732
Maybe start with a kidney,
upgrade the ticker,

02:55.734 --> 02:57.931
then if all goes well,
I'll do my breasts.

02:59.330 --> 03:02.053
Oh... I don't want you to leave.

03:02.055 --> 03:04.072
Carol, you hold him
down, I'll break his legs.

03:04.074 --> 03:05.944
Aww.

03:05.946 --> 03:07.992
I'm gonna miss you guys, too.

03:07.994 --> 03:09.799
Hey, can I ask you guys something?

03:09.801 --> 03:11.166
It's a little sentimental.

03:11.168 --> 03:13.757
Sentimental? You have my attention.

03:13.759 --> 03:16.123
The whole time I've
been cooped up in here,

03:16.125 --> 03:17.607
I've been dreaming of fresh air.

03:17.609 --> 03:20.785
So, when I'm cleared to leave,
the first thing I want to do

03:20.787 --> 03:22.787
is go up to the roof and raise a toast.

03:22.789 --> 03:25.833
A little thank you
from me to my doctors.

03:25.835 --> 03:29.445
Don't worry, little
guy, it's nonalcoholic.

03:29.447 --> 03:30.751
Oh, Eddie.

03:30.753 --> 03:33.232
You want to toast us on the roof?

03:33.234 --> 03:36.235
I'm gonna tell you right
now, I will be sobbing.

03:36.237 --> 03:38.822
Frankly, I'm surprised
I'm not already sobbing.

03:38.824 --> 03:40.935
Wait, here it comes.

03:40.937 --> 03:43.720
Think about Daniel and Jenny hooking up.

03:43.722 --> 03:46.029
Okay. I'm back.

03:47.712 --> 03:51.167
Oh, Eddie, that would be
lovely. As long as we can avoid

03:51.169 --> 03:53.469
the pigeons and the trauma helicopters.

03:53.471 --> 03:57.404
Trauma helicopters, filthy
birds, nonalcoholic booze.

03:57.406 --> 04:00.191
What can I say? I know how to party.

04:01.164 --> 04:03.789
Now tell me, how are things
going with your surgeon?

04:07.050 --> 04:08.702
What?

04:08.704 --> 04:10.469
He's been in the
hospital for three months.

04:10.471 --> 04:11.923
Gossip's all he has.

04:11.925 --> 04:14.839
Okay.

04:14.841 --> 04:18.016
It might be true that I have

04:18.017 --> 04:21.671
an itty-bitty, teensy-weensy,
not even a big deal crush

04:21.673 --> 04:23.151
on Dr. Lewis.

04:23.153 --> 04:25.893
- Ooh...
- But I... Okay.

04:25.895 --> 04:27.329
I don't know how he feels.

04:27.331 --> 04:30.115
And he certainly hasn't
expressed any interest.

04:30.117 --> 04:32.117
Well, dating at work
is tough these days.

04:32.119 --> 04:34.771
As a guy, you don't want to
do anything disrespectful,

04:34.773 --> 04:36.730
so sometimes you have
to wait for the woman

04:36.732 --> 04:38.036
to make the first move.

04:38.038 --> 04:40.847
Really? I have to flirt with him?

04:40.849 --> 04:43.911
Oh, my gosh. I don't know
if I even remember how.

04:43.913 --> 04:46.871
Carol, how long has it been
since you flirted with a guy?

04:46.873 --> 04:49.874
On purpose? 30 years.

04:49.876 --> 04:51.919
Unintentionally? A week.

04:51.921 --> 04:54.052
Caleb had a little piece
of lint on his cheek.

04:54.054 --> 04:56.469
I leaned in to blow it off
and I accidentally kissed him.

04:57.971 --> 05:00.797
Take it from a guy who
stared death in the face:

05:00.799 --> 05:02.499
you got to take your shots.

05:02.501 --> 05:03.988
You'll be great. Just tell him

05:03.990 --> 05:05.280
it looks like he's been working out.

05:05.282 --> 05:07.195
Guys love that stuff.

05:07.197 --> 05:09.502
If he flirts back,
you know he likes you.

05:09.504 --> 05:11.896
Oh, well, I just might.

05:11.898 --> 05:13.245
But right now, you get some rest.

05:13.247 --> 05:14.855
I'm gonna order you some pain killers.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.596
And a pair of D cups.

05:18.905 --> 05:21.601
Let's go C. I want it to look natural.

05:23.605 --> 05:26.342
So, the ER sent you up
for a possible concussion,

05:26.344 --> 05:28.303
but I don't see any bruises or swelling.

05:28.305 --> 05:31.237
Huh, that's weird, because
I definitely got kicked

05:31.239 --> 05:33.458
in the head by three different horses.

05:35.008 --> 05:38.009
Before we order an MRI,
would you say you're nauseous?

05:38.011 --> 05:40.185
No, in fact, I'm pretty hungry.

05:40.187 --> 05:42.274
Hmm. Are you dizzy?

05:42.276 --> 05:45.757
No. Everything's fine, except
for this awful concussion.

05:47.324 --> 05:49.846
Well, you don't have the two
main symptoms of a concussion,

05:49.848 --> 05:51.283
so we can rule that out.

05:51.285 --> 05:53.285
Oh, man, really?

05:53.287 --> 05:55.071
Can you ask me those questions again?

05:56.768 --> 05:58.551
All right, Greg. What's going on?

05:58.553 --> 06:02.990
The truth is, I'm having
the worst week of my life.

06:02.992 --> 06:05.243
- My girlfriend broke up with me.
- Oof.

06:05.245 --> 06:07.573
- While I was proposing.
- Oof.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.641
Because she's in love
with my best friend.

06:09.643 --> 06:12.736
And while I was in my apartment,

06:12.738 --> 06:16.221
sobbing, my car got stolen.

06:16.223 --> 06:19.615
I was so depressed, I didn't
go to work for three days.

06:19.617 --> 06:22.314
I work at this furniture
store, Danny's...

06:22.316 --> 06:24.100
Oh, that's where I got
my dining room chair.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.472
You bought one dining room chair?

06:27.474 --> 06:28.842
Uh-huh.

06:28.844 --> 06:31.157
Anyway, my boss was about to fire me,

06:31.159 --> 06:32.846
but I told him I was sick.

06:32.848 --> 06:35.849
He said to keep my job,
I need a doctor's note.

06:35.851 --> 06:36.921
Oh, I don't know.

06:36.923 --> 06:40.078
Writing a fake doctor's
note is sort of a gray area.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.625
I don't want to get you
guys in trouble. It's just,

06:42.627 --> 06:45.119
if I lose this job, I lose my insurance.

06:45.121 --> 06:48.907
And that's literally the
only thing I have left.

06:51.171 --> 06:53.171
I-I really would like to help you.

06:53.173 --> 06:55.356
You seem so pathetic.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.263
Thank you.

06:59.713 --> 07:03.173
Hey, you said you were
feeling depressed, right?

07:03.175 --> 07:05.922
- Totally.
- Oh. Great.

07:05.924 --> 07:08.795
Then we can give you a note
saying you visited the doctor

07:08.797 --> 07:11.316
for a legitimate medical concern.

07:11.318 --> 07:12.519
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:12.521 --> 07:14.436
Oh, man. You two are the best.

07:14.438 --> 07:17.325
This will just take a minute.

07:17.327 --> 07:19.371
Ah... There he is.

07:19.373 --> 07:22.461
Carol, are you ready
to get your flirt on?

07:22.463 --> 07:24.677
I don't know, I just finished my salad,

07:24.679 --> 07:27.324
and I think you're supposed to
wait 30 minutes after eating?

07:27.326 --> 07:29.772
Carol, come on. Trust me,
I know from experience.

07:29.774 --> 07:31.731
It'll all be worth it when
you and that special person

07:31.733 --> 07:34.402
get to finally connect both
emotionally and physically...

07:34.404 --> 07:36.122
- No.
- Dude, that is her daughter.

07:36.124 --> 07:37.416
Gross.

07:37.418 --> 07:39.052
Okay, listen, I can do this.

07:39.054 --> 07:41.184
I just have to go over
there and be friendly.

07:41.186 --> 07:43.839
No, no, no, no. Regular
Carol is friendly.

07:43.841 --> 07:46.355
He needs to know that
you want a piece of that.

07:46.357 --> 07:50.566
So, when in doubt, I say lick your lips.

07:54.296 --> 07:56.037
Okay, definitely don't do that.

07:57.194 --> 08:00.305
I like Eddie's advice.
Just compliment his body.

08:00.307 --> 08:03.113
That should be easy.
He has great wrists.

08:03.115 --> 08:05.382
Carol, do not listen to
these amateurs, all right?

08:05.384 --> 08:07.428
Just mention a restaurant
you want to try,

08:07.430 --> 08:08.546
and if he takes the bait,

08:08.548 --> 08:10.049
- it means he likes you.
- Right.

08:10.051 --> 08:15.578
Like, "Hey, are you a fan
of the... Spaghetti Factory?"

08:16.609 --> 08:18.091
You've all been a huge help.

08:19.355 --> 08:20.617
Okay.

08:23.924 --> 08:25.446
- Hi.
- Oh.

08:25.448 --> 08:27.230
Sorry, that-that came out
louder than I intended.

08:27.232 --> 08:30.405
- Ah. Good to see you, Dr. Kenney.
- Yeah.

08:30.407 --> 08:32.234
I-I'm sorry. Am I, uh,
blocking the bananas?

08:32.236 --> 08:34.368
Uh, no. Um, I already ate.

08:34.370 --> 08:37.311
Uh, just, uh, just wanted to say howdy.

08:37.313 --> 08:38.596
Hmm.

08:38.597 --> 08:41.405
Oh. Burrito. Very nice.

08:41.407 --> 08:44.126
It's sort of the sandwich of Mexico.

08:44.128 --> 08:47.022
Actually, a Mexican
sandwich is a called a torta.

08:47.024 --> 08:50.505
Oh, wow. Neat fact.

08:52.994 --> 08:54.886
So, um...

08:54.888 --> 08:58.695
Dr. Lewis, have you been working out?

08:58.697 --> 09:00.155
Excuse me?

09:00.157 --> 09:02.265
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
it as a personal comment.

09:02.267 --> 09:04.572
I-I only ask because
I'm looking for a gym.

09:04.574 --> 09:07.662
For exercise. Because
I've gained weight.

09:07.664 --> 09:09.055
Really?

09:09.057 --> 09:11.144
Well, have you considered
a low-carb diet?

09:11.146 --> 09:15.365
Well, I would, but I just can't
get enough of those tortas.

09:15.367 --> 09:17.150
The ones I just told you about?

09:17.152 --> 09:18.977
Uh-huh.

09:18.979 --> 09:20.285
Okay.

09:24.115 --> 09:26.217
Oh, um, Dr. Lewis, speaking of food,

09:26.219 --> 09:28.378
have you heard? There is a
great new sushi restaurant

09:28.380 --> 09:30.119
that opened up just across the street.

09:30.121 --> 09:32.339
I don't know if you're a fan of ginger,

09:32.341 --> 09:34.080
but you can have as much as you want.

09:34.082 --> 09:35.124
Oh.

09:35.126 --> 09:37.909
Well, I love sushi.

09:37.911 --> 09:42.000
You know what, I should
give it a try. Thanks, Carol.

09:42.002 --> 09:44.757
Oh, darn it. I'm-I'm getting paged.

09:44.759 --> 09:46.587
Uh, nice seeing you, Dr. Kenney.

09:55.625 --> 09:57.190
Uh, Carol, uh,

09:57.192 --> 09:58.901
I'm gonna be real:

09:58.903 --> 10:00.534
t-that was terrible.

10:04.151 --> 10:05.912
Oh...

10:05.914 --> 10:08.661
I'm sorry for the sounds I'm making.

10:08.663 --> 10:11.038
Hold up, is that a massage chair?

10:11.040 --> 10:14.163
One of your patients sent it.

10:14.165 --> 10:17.949
"Thank you for lying
for me and saving my job.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.447
Sincerely, Greg",

10:19.449 --> 10:23.430
in parentheses, "The Kicked
in the Head by a Horse Guy".

10:23.432 --> 10:27.002
Daniel, vamoose. I want that
cushion to form to my butt.

10:27.004 --> 10:29.222
Lexie, we need to return it.

10:29.224 --> 10:31.533
Great idea. Or, hear me out,

10:31.535 --> 10:33.515
we keep it forever.

10:33.517 --> 10:34.952
Lexie, of one...

10:34.954 --> 10:38.065
If we just ask Dr. Frost,
can we skip the speech?

10:38.067 --> 10:40.283
Hey. Massage chair?

10:40.285 --> 10:42.786
Lexie and Caleb got
it as part of a bribe.

10:42.788 --> 10:44.601
You should try it. It'll make you forget

10:44.603 --> 10:45.686
all about yesterday.

10:45.688 --> 10:47.841
Oh, my God, I can't
stop thinking about that.

10:47.843 --> 10:49.779
It was excruciating.

10:49.781 --> 10:51.425
I have never been so humiliated.

10:51.427 --> 10:54.494
I mean, I put myself out
there in the most obvious way.

10:54.496 --> 10:57.337
He gave me nothing back. Not a sign.

10:57.339 --> 10:59.252
At least we know how he feels about me.

10:59.254 --> 11:00.775
Case closed.

11:00.777 --> 11:02.768
Hey, hey, Carol, you tried.

11:02.770 --> 11:04.402
Not everybody can say that.

11:06.429 --> 11:08.261
Dr. Lewis.

11:08.263 --> 11:10.199
Hey, Carol, everyone.

11:10.201 --> 11:11.945
I was just in the
neighborhood and thought

11:11.947 --> 11:14.249
maybe I could fill up in here.

11:14.251 --> 11:15.610
I-I don't want to interrupt anything.

11:15.612 --> 11:18.027
No, of course not. Sure. Help yourself.

11:18.029 --> 11:19.073
Thank you.

11:28.152 --> 11:30.352
It's nice in here.

11:32.112 --> 11:33.547
I see you have a couch.

11:33.549 --> 11:35.489
Yes, we do.

11:35.491 --> 11:38.886
We call her "Ol' Couchy".

11:39.856 --> 11:42.526
Okay, I will see you later.

11:42.528 --> 11:45.378
See ya.

11:45.380 --> 11:49.171
"Ol' Couchy"? What is wrong with me?!

11:49.173 --> 11:51.577
Uh, Carol, you're missing the point.

11:51.579 --> 11:53.046
That was your sign. He's into you.

11:53.048 --> 11:54.244
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

11:54.246 --> 11:55.791
Why else would he have come in here?

11:55.793 --> 11:57.044
For a coffee. He told us.

11:57.046 --> 11:58.373
Carol, the surgeons' lounge has

11:58.375 --> 12:00.424
a professional-quality espresso machine.

12:00.426 --> 12:02.602
We use newspaper for a coffee filter.

12:03.847 --> 12:05.739
He did not come in here for the coffee.

12:05.741 --> 12:08.263
He came in here for the Carol.

12:08.265 --> 12:10.742
Oh, my.

12:10.744 --> 12:12.070
He likes me.

12:12.072 --> 12:13.247
- Yeah!
- Ooh, ooh!

12:15.831 --> 12:18.193
Wait, so he pretended
to stop by for coffee

12:18.195 --> 12:19.989
- just so he could see you?
- I...

12:19.991 --> 12:22.449
That is the cutest
thing I've ever heard.

12:22.451 --> 12:24.708
I mean, I think he was
even a little nervous.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.493
He complimented our couch.

12:26.495 --> 12:28.057
That garbage couch?

12:28.059 --> 12:29.626
It is garbage. Yeah.

12:29.628 --> 12:31.890
You know, for someone who once said

12:31.892 --> 12:33.892
they didn't approve
of workplace romances,

12:33.894 --> 12:35.981
you are dangerously
close to being in one.

12:35.983 --> 12:38.592
- You think I'm dangerously close?
- Yes.

12:38.594 --> 12:42.242
Okay, so... what do I do?

12:42.244 --> 12:44.337
I think you should text him.

12:44.339 --> 12:46.165
Text him?

12:46.167 --> 12:47.644
You don't think that's too forward?

12:47.646 --> 12:49.603
No, it's exactly forward enough.

12:49.605 --> 12:51.742
I guess it's like Eddie said.
I should just take my shot.

12:51.744 --> 12:52.853
- Yeah.
- All right.

12:52.855 --> 12:56.596
To craft... the perfect text.

12:58.550 --> 13:01.619
"Hey..."

13:01.621 --> 13:03.666
Send.

13:10.299 --> 13:12.669
That's really good.

13:12.671 --> 13:14.671
And now we wait.

13:14.673 --> 13:16.762
Okay.

13:17.813 --> 13:19.400
I think when you see this gift,

13:19.402 --> 13:21.512
you'll understand why we're concerned.

13:21.514 --> 13:23.494
Or you'll be like, "This is no biggie.

13:23.496 --> 13:25.519
Lexie was right the whole time.

13:25.521 --> 13:27.815
Pip pip... cheerio".

13:27.817 --> 13:31.166
Your impression of me
has improved, Dr. Gilani.

13:31.168 --> 13:33.038
Now, I do love a juicy moral dilemma,

13:33.040 --> 13:34.389
so let's see what we've got.

13:35.455 --> 13:39.022
Oh, my goodness.

13:39.024 --> 13:41.502
Wow, this is troubling.

13:41.504 --> 13:44.592
First of all, Dennis,
stop making eye contact.

13:44.594 --> 13:46.029
And second,

13:46.031 --> 13:47.421
this chair is the gift?

13:47.423 --> 13:49.510
I know. Cool, right?

13:49.512 --> 13:51.208
When you said "a sizeable gift",

13:51.210 --> 13:52.600
I thought you meant a big cake.

13:52.602 --> 13:54.124
This is unprecedented.

13:54.126 --> 13:57.257
Oh, so there's no precedent.
We can keep it.

13:57.259 --> 13:59.477
No. And I'm disappointed in you both.

13:59.479 --> 14:00.826
You should never accept a gift

14:00.828 --> 14:02.480
in exchange for medical services.

14:02.482 --> 14:04.874
I'm sorry, Dr. Frost.

14:04.876 --> 14:06.484
Well, what can we do?

14:06.486 --> 14:08.442
For now, I want you to find the hardest,

14:08.444 --> 14:10.967
most unforgiving
chairs in the cafeteria,

14:10.969 --> 14:12.927
sit in them and think
about what you've done.

14:16.844 --> 14:19.236
So, if they can't keep it,
what are you gonna do?

14:19.238 --> 14:22.326
I'm gonna give this to
someone who really deserves it.

14:22.328 --> 14:25.693
Oh...

14:25.695 --> 14:27.239
God, what was I thinking?

14:27.241 --> 14:29.202
I should never have texted him.

14:29.204 --> 14:31.901
Oh, my God. And "hey"? That's terrible.

14:31.903 --> 14:35.121
"Hey". "Hey!" "Hey..." Idiot.

14:35.123 --> 14:37.994
Mom, it's fine. It's
only been three minutes.

14:37.996 --> 14:39.604
Well...

14:39.606 --> 14:41.998
I mean, that's it. I'm shutting it down.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.521
Dating is not for me.

14:43.523 --> 14:46.176
I mean, okay, I admit I
was excited by the idea

14:46.178 --> 14:49.005
that a handsome, successful
man might like me.

14:49.007 --> 14:50.658
But dating is just so uncomfortable.

14:50.660 --> 14:53.226
I mean, what comes next?
We go get martinis.

14:53.228 --> 14:55.663
And then what if we have
nothing to say to each other?

14:55.665 --> 14:57.491
What if he wants to kiss me?

14:57.493 --> 14:59.450
What if he doesn't want to kiss me?

14:59.452 --> 15:01.175
What if he wants to have sex...

15:01.177 --> 15:03.287
Mom!

15:03.289 --> 15:05.848
It just... It freaks me out.

15:05.850 --> 15:08.154
And for what? For the opportunity

15:08.156 --> 15:10.330
to take care of a man who's sliding down

15:10.332 --> 15:14.247
the wrong side of the hill
into incontinence and dementia.

15:14.249 --> 15:16.336
Okay, this is a full spiral.

15:16.338 --> 15:18.988
No, that's it. Jenny, take my phone.

15:18.990 --> 15:20.645
I don't want to check it
for the rest of the night.

15:20.647 --> 15:22.560
Mom, Dr. Lewis is calling.

15:22.562 --> 15:24.649
Give it to me!

15:24.651 --> 15:26.085
- How do I look?
- It's a phone call.

15:26.087 --> 15:28.044
Yes.

15:28.046 --> 15:30.570
Hey.

15:33.573 --> 15:35.355
Oh.

15:35.357 --> 15:38.358
Yeah. Of course.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.752
- Thanks for calling.
- Oh, no.

15:40.754 --> 15:43.798
Mom, that man is an idiot.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.383
No, no, no. It's not that.

15:46.385 --> 15:49.431
Our patient Eddie, he died.

16:06.998 --> 16:08.867
It's like he was never there.

16:08.869 --> 16:11.375
Dr. Jacobs told me
this is the first time

16:11.377 --> 16:12.610
you've lost a patient.

16:12.612 --> 16:14.612
How are you?

16:14.614 --> 16:17.528
A few hours ago, we were
laughing and celebrating.

16:17.530 --> 16:18.703
What happened?

16:18.705 --> 16:21.662
His immune response was too strong.

16:21.664 --> 16:24.796
It's the hardest part about
this job: the unpredictability.

16:24.798 --> 16:26.918
Ten percent of the time,
the immunosuppressants

16:26.920 --> 16:28.062
just aren't enough.

16:28.064 --> 16:31.281
There's nothing you or any of
us could have done about it.

16:31.283 --> 16:35.067
I-I can't believe how
quickly things move on.

16:35.069 --> 16:39.506
It may seem callous, but
death is a common thing here.

16:39.508 --> 16:43.641
We have a job to do, and
other people to take care of.

16:43.643 --> 16:47.429
I promise, over time,
it does get easier.

16:48.953 --> 16:51.301
Do I want it to get easier?

16:51.303 --> 16:55.220
If you need anything, I'm around.

16:59.398 --> 17:03.313
Sometimes... I find it helps me

17:03.315 --> 17:07.406
to take a private moment to
say goodbye in my own way.

17:08.667 --> 17:10.974
Hang in there.

17:43.050 --> 17:46.965
Well, Eddie, you stood me up.

17:46.967 --> 17:49.707
Not cool.

17:49.709 --> 17:52.188
I did steal your bottle
of fake booze, though,

17:52.190 --> 17:55.758
so I guess we can call it even.

17:58.761 --> 18:01.849
Oh, boy.

18:01.851 --> 18:05.247
I mean, you were cooped up
in that tiny room for months,

18:05.249 --> 18:07.004
and somehow you seemed
like the happiest person

18:07.006 --> 18:08.591
in the hospital.

18:08.593 --> 18:11.226
You know, you just...
you never lost your joy

18:11.228 --> 18:12.815
or your sense of humor.

18:12.817 --> 18:15.754
You just lived every day to the fullest.

18:15.756 --> 18:17.375
Even if, for the last little while,

18:17.377 --> 18:18.760
all it meant was switching the kickers

18:18.762 --> 18:20.547
on your fantasy football team.

18:25.788 --> 18:28.748
I'm gonna miss you.

18:32.870 --> 18:35.284
- Dr. Kenney.
- Dr. Lewis. Hi.

18:35.286 --> 18:37.102
I'm sorry, I...

18:38.888 --> 18:41.628
I guess Eddie told you his plan, too.

18:41.630 --> 18:44.762
I thought they'd thrown the bottle out.

18:44.764 --> 18:47.598
I had to run to the corner store.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.941
Seemed important to him.

18:49.943 --> 18:51.899
Yeah.

18:51.901 --> 18:54.424
I owe you an apology.

18:54.426 --> 18:56.516
You said that letting patients in

18:56.518 --> 18:58.297
makes it harder to do your job,

18:58.299 --> 19:00.422
and you were right.

19:00.424 --> 19:02.403
I should have never
pushed you to do that.

19:02.405 --> 19:03.767
I didn't know how bad it felt.

19:03.769 --> 19:05.096
- Mm.
- Yeah.

19:05.098 --> 19:07.991
No, I was glad that I got to know Eddie.

19:07.993 --> 19:11.777
I...

19:11.779 --> 19:14.606
I haven't felt connected
to a patient like this

19:14.608 --> 19:16.782
in a long time.

19:16.784 --> 19:19.133
Which is funny because
it's sort of the reason

19:19.135 --> 19:21.787
I got into medicine in the first place.

19:21.789 --> 19:24.181
- So thank you.
- Oh, you're...

19:24.183 --> 19:25.706
you're welcome.

19:28.297 --> 19:31.517
You actually have had
quite an effect on me.

19:34.997 --> 19:37.107
In fact, I actually
feel like doing things

19:37.109 --> 19:38.610
that I normally wouldn't.

19:38.612 --> 19:41.920
Oh, really? Like what?

19:54.816 --> 19:56.992
- Trauma helicopter!
- Get down!

20:02.142 --> 20:04.794
I can't believe Eddie's gone.

20:04.796 --> 20:06.753
This isn't gonna be the
last time this happens.

20:06.755 --> 20:10.452
But we'll be here for each other.

20:10.454 --> 20:12.417
If either of you need me
to mentor you through this,

20:12.419 --> 20:14.065
I'm here.

20:14.067 --> 20:16.110
Daniel, I'm older than you.

20:16.112 --> 20:18.765
But I'm wise.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.334
I just hope Carol isn't
taking this too hard.

20:27.689 --> 20:29.428
What the heck happened?

20:29.430 --> 20:30.777
Nothing.

20:30.779 --> 20:32.955
Just... nothing.

20:40.789 --> 20:43.877
Oh, I see what happened.
