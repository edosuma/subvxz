<i>Grab those bathing suits and beach chairs</i>
<i>and get outside if you can,</i>

00:18.894 --> 00:22.606
<i>because it's going to be</i>
<i>another beautiful day here in Los Angeles.</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:25.776
<i>Clear and sunny skies</i>
<i>with a high of 86 degrees.</i>

00:25.859 --> 00:29.571
<i>Current temperature is a perfect 82 degrees.</i>

00:29.655 --> 00:31.865
<i>The five-day forecast</i>
<i>calls for more ofthe same.</i>

00:31.949 --> 00:33.784
<i>Highs in the mid-to-upper 80s,</i>

00:33.867 --> 00:37.371
<i>lows in the high 60s to low 70s</i>
<i>for the rest of the week.</i>

00:37.454 --> 00:39.665
<i>A few clouds to speak of here and there.</i>

00:39.748 --> 00:44.169
<i>Other than that,</i>
<i>a beautiful, typical Los Angeles-type week.</i>

01:01.979 --> 01:03.564
-What's up?
-Hey, man.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.620
Move.

01:20.205 --> 01:21.790
Hey, Slater.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.375
What are you doing here, man?

01:23.458 --> 01:24.835
What am I doing?
You know what I'm doing here.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.546
-Dude, I don't have the money.
-Come on. You don't have my money?

01:27.629 --> 01:30.591
I have people over.
You come to my house uninvited.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.513
Give me my money, Slater,
or I kill everybody!

03:13.652 --> 03:14.653
Dave, we in?

03:14.736 --> 03:16.697
<i>Yeah, we just deactivated</i>
<i>all the alarms in the house.</i>

03:17.572 --> 03:18.573
<i>Eagle has eyes.</i>

03:19.866 --> 03:20.867
We've got a lot of kids in here.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.577
-Let's use the disruptor shells.
-Got it.

03:27.749 --> 03:28.917
-Hello?
-Hey, Slater?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.837
This is Sergeant Cutler with LAPD.
What's going on in there?

03:31.920 --> 03:35.173
Dude, these two uninvited A-holes
crashed my party.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.801
My parents are going to kill me.
They've got my friends in the den.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.219
Get in here and shoot them.

03:42.597 --> 03:43.932
You have any weapons in there, Slater?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.813
No, man. Just get your asses in here
and shoot these dicks.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.115
Shut the hell up!

04:02.367 --> 04:04.119
All right, this is a drug deal gone bad.
We're going in.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.204
Full breach and blow. On my "Go."

04:15.505 --> 04:16.673
<i>Bravo team, what's your status?</i>

04:17.257 --> 04:19.551
<i>Nearing back entrance. Ten meters out.</i>

04:25.932 --> 04:28.226
<i>Bravo team, secure perimeter in the back.</i>

04:28.310 --> 04:30.812
<i>-Back entrance is secure.</i>
<i>-Go on my command.</i>

04:31.813 --> 04:32.814
Go, go.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.988
<i>-Bravo team, go!</i>
-Go.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.829
Put the gun down, Slater.

04:49.498 --> 04:52.667
They crashed my party.
They drank all my beer, man.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.546
Get down! Now!

04:57.047 --> 04:58.131
Get down!

05:00.008 --> 05:01.801
Get down on the floor.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.683
I will be going now.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.103
-You got it?
-Got it.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.190
Close your eyes, sweetheart.

05:16.816 --> 05:17.817
Oh, my God!

05:46.555 --> 05:48.139
Suspects in custody.

05:48.557 --> 05:49.766
Those water shell things...

05:50.183 --> 05:53.853
Disruptor shells. Bomb squad uses them.
Thought I'd give them a try.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.438
Nice work. Quantico?

05:55.730 --> 05:58.149
Yeah, picked it up
with a faw other nifty tricks.

05:58.567 --> 06:01.069
-Way to think outside the box.
-Captain Simon,

06:02.237 --> 06:04.114
why are you kissing my ass?

06:04.531 --> 06:05.740
Feds and Homeland Security

06:05.824 --> 06:08.827
need another hostage-rescue training
specialist loaned out.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.871
A SWAT team needs a tune-up.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.081
Brought up to modern methods code.
That's all.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.541
Where?

06:15.333 --> 06:17.586
-Detroit.
-Detroit?

06:17.669 --> 06:18.670
Get in.

06:21.381 --> 06:25.218
Bailey got to train Honolulu PD.
And Carson wentto Miami for three weeks.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.428
I get Detroit?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.305
It's a nice place. My wife is from Detroit.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.182
-Send her.
-Look, you went to lraq for your country.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.101
You won't go to Detroit for your city?

06:34.311 --> 06:36.813
I believe department regulations
called it an "honor request."

06:36.897 --> 06:38.440
And I am politely turning down the offer.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.775
The negotiations start.
How much do you want?

06:40.942 --> 06:42.027
How bad does the mayor want me?

06:43.236 --> 06:44.237
Pretty badly.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.162
You are such a bad negotiator.

06:52.245 --> 06:56.333
Detroit requested the best.
Our mayor is buddies with their mayor.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.126
Besides, who's going to miss you here,

06:58.752 --> 07:00.670
except for me?

07:00.754 --> 07:03.465
So, how much?

07:04.299 --> 07:08.261
Promotion. Lieutenant would be nice.
Bump in pay, too.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.513
I'll see what I can do.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.811
-Harrison got San Francisco.
-Yeah.

08:21.376 --> 08:22.377
Hey, Trish.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.878
Gonna let me in, stranger?

08:26.089 --> 08:27.882
You need a date? I brought us dinner.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.302
You dumped me, remember?
I work too much.

08:31.928 --> 08:35.056
-Yeah. Right.
-Sorry, school night.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.100
Got a lot of homework to do.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.311
And I don't want you hating me
in the morning.

08:40.395 --> 08:43.982
Someday you're going to meet somebody
that you care about more than work.

08:44.065 --> 08:47.027
And when you do, embrace her,

08:47.902 --> 08:52.323
or else she's going to figure out
that you are emotionally unavailable.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.620
Good night.

09:31.946 --> 09:34.949
Detroit ain't so bad. Looks kind of charming.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.334
-Detroit SWAT?
-You found it.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.670
-You on the SWAT team?
-Four years.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.173
So, can I help you?

10:32.841 --> 10:34.676
Paul Cutler, LAPD SWAT.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.636
Yeah, yeah. We got the memo.

10:37.846 --> 10:40.306
Terrorist preparedness
and hostage-rescue specialist, yeah?

10:40.390 --> 10:41.391
That's me.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.017
Wayne Wolport. Nice to meet you.

10:43.434 --> 10:44.853
So where's the rest of you guys?

10:44.978 --> 10:47.188
Weight shed. Weapons cleaning.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.275
What's your average response time?

10:51.693 --> 10:53.778
We're locked and loaded
within a 10-to-15, usually.

10:53.862 --> 10:54.863
Really?

11:04.873 --> 11:06.499
<i>9-1-1. What is your emergency?</i>

11:06.583 --> 11:08.001
I'm atthe Rosa Parks Bus Station.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.712
I think I just spotted a guy
with a bomb in his backpack.

11:10.795 --> 11:11.838
<i>Can you still see him?</i>

11:11.921 --> 11:15.091
Yeah, he's sitting on a park bench
across from the main entrance.

11:15.174 --> 11:19.012
Black boots, black hat and hoodie.

11:49.918 --> 11:51.294
Go, go, go!

11:52.128 --> 11:53.588
Hands up! Hands up!

11:53.838 --> 11:55.256
Put your hands up!

11:55.590 --> 11:57.467
Hands up! Hands up!

11:57.550 --> 11:59.093
Move away from the bench!

12:01.262 --> 12:02.597
Walk toward us slowly.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.515
Drop the bag on the ground!

12:05.350 --> 12:07.685
Drop the bag on the ground slow.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.729
Step away from the bag.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.231
Hey, Wolport.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.026
Cutler?

12:15.610 --> 12:17.904
Where's your waffle?
I was hoping you'd bring it with you.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.282
Stand down, guys! One of us!

12:21.366 --> 12:22.450
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

12:31.459 --> 12:35.380
I reach for my creds,
they're not going to shoot me, are they?

12:38.967 --> 12:39.968
Stop!

12:40.969 --> 12:43.137
How do you know
I didn't buy this badge over the Internet?

12:43.346 --> 12:45.265
Come down to the station and chat you up,

12:45.348 --> 12:48.309
so that when you showed up here,
I could blow all of us up

12:48.393 --> 12:51.229
with the Semtex high explosives
I have in this backpack?

12:52.647 --> 12:56.109
Because Mr. Mundy has been monitoring you
with a bomb sniffer.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.278
Welcome to Detroit.

12:58.987 --> 12:59.988
That's very good.

13:00.071 --> 13:03.992
Mr. Cutler is here to teach and preach
the ways of Quantico,

13:04.492 --> 13:07.537
the FBl's hostage-rescue tactics.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.082
This little stunt was sanctioned by the feds

13:11.165 --> 13:15.878
in cooperation with the mayor's office
and our lovely chief of police.

13:16.087 --> 13:19.507
A provocative action
to test your response time.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.844
Mr. Cutler?

13:22.927 --> 13:25.263
Nice start, boys. Outstanding.

13:41.779 --> 13:42.947
Well, I think you got their attention.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.073
That's what I'm here for.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.451
Homeland thinks
you have some high-value targets.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.535
Who doesn't?

13:47.952 --> 13:49.412
This is our playbook.

13:50.163 --> 13:54.208
Maps, details of major venues,
airport information.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.587
I'll evaluate the team,
get them to full mission readiness.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.590
lf they pass,
they'll get full FBl HRT certification.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.008
And what if they don't?

14:02.884 --> 14:04.927
My recommendation will be
you replace them.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.972
Homeland's setting the bar
pretfy high these days.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.223
Let's just get a few things straight.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.809
-Okay.
-Ground rules.

14:11.893 --> 14:14.729
You are not part of this department,
so you'll have no actual authority.

14:15.188 --> 14:18.232
The SWAT team is mine, not yours.
You are a guest.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.984
The mayor's guest. Not mine.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.861
I think there's been some miscommunication.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.821
I'll need full command of your team
while I'm here.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.323
That was nevera ariculated to me.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.574
Then we have a problem.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.825
If I'm going to train your men,

14:27.909 --> 14:31.079
I have to be able to do it in the field,
not on a shooting range.

14:31.162 --> 14:35.249
I am not giving you command
ofthe SWAT team. Sorry.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.669
Thank you for a very lovely,
very short visit to your beautiful city.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.548
-Where're you going?
-Airport.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.008
Unless I'm in charge of your men,

14:44.092 --> 14:46.010
-I can't certify them.
-Why not?

14:46.094 --> 14:49.097
HRT and terror preparedness training
isn't a quick-study course.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.389
They need to do what I tell them,

14:50.473 --> 14:53.017
the way I tell them to do it, in the field.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.727
It's federal regulations.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.070
I will issue a provisional command.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.198
Sir.

15:09.867 --> 15:10.868
-He in there?
-Pardon?

15:10.952 --> 15:12.286
-Hollander? He in his office?
-Yes.

15:13.371 --> 15:16.332
-LAPD. I got a sister there.
-She a cop?

15:16.416 --> 15:18.626
No, no. Graphic designer. Long Beach.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.211
You got a minute, Inspector?

15:20.586 --> 15:22.964
Hi, I'm Kim. Department shrink.

15:23.297 --> 15:24.799
Paul. Visitor.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.468
Hi, Paul Visitor. I'll see you around.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.058
Well, it is a little bit.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.352
What are you going to do tonight?
Are you coming or not?

15:36.978 --> 15:38.229
Hey, guys.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.823
-Where'd you get that?
-Across the street.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.032
Homemade butterscotch sauce.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.160
Enjoy it. It's your last one.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.579
But why? I passed my physicals.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.747
-I can do 200 sit-ups.
-You can?

15:56.831 --> 15:59.167
Yeah. Want to see me?

15:59.750 --> 16:01.169
I believe you.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.046
You have to quit smoking.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.549
How long you here for, sir?

16:06.841 --> 16:09.677
Two weeks. Less if you pick it up quickly.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.430
You want me to quit smoking for two weeks?

16:12.513 --> 16:15.558
Sir, I've been smoking for 14 years.
What good's that going to do me?

16:15.641 --> 16:19.395
You? Nothing.
But I can't stand the smell of smoke.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.522
Well, that sucks for you.

16:21.606 --> 16:24.400
It sucks for you. I'm the new team leader.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.570
Training for your certification
starts tomorrow morning at 0500.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.489
We got a bachelor party tonight
in Ann Arbor.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.450
One of the guys from Metro's getting hitched.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.869
Okay. Make it 0700.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.580
-Have a beer for me.
-All right, what do you drink?

16:38.164 --> 16:39.457
I hate smoke, too.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.168
He doesn't look so special to me.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.170
That's 'cause you ain't looking in the mirror.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.464
-I kind of like him.
-He's a clown.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.382
Nobody gives a shit what you think.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.872
-My God.
-Man, you were a dancing machine last night.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.458
He was, too.

17:22.791 --> 17:23.960
So, how were the strippers?

17:24.502 --> 17:26.212
Pretty good. Thanks for asking.

17:30.174 --> 17:33.469
You won the SWAT shoot-off last year,
is that right?

17:33.553 --> 17:34.679
And the year before.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.180
The year before was a tie.

17:36.264 --> 17:38.266
Yeah, I tied for first.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.271
-You never lost a hostage.
-Not yet.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.524
So, while I'm here,
I'm going to be your training liaison

17:46.607 --> 17:49.277
and your officer
in charge of SWAT operations.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.530
We'll go out on regular calls
and respond as a unit.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.950
The only difference will be this.
I will be instructing you as you go.

17:56.409 --> 18:00.997
Today we're going to do a three-mile run,
50 push-ups, 80 sit-ups and 10 chin-ups.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.666
Hey, that's usually our quarterly fitness test.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.252
I'm going to be throwing
a lot of curve balls at you guys,

18:06.335 --> 18:07.461
so don't be afraid to swing.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.755
Wake me up when you're done.

18:10.256 --> 18:13.634
This will help you get through the day,

18:14.468 --> 18:15.970
and I'll take these.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.097
You're just going to take them from me?

18:20.308 --> 18:22.476
<i>Conditioning is important in police work.</i>

18:23.227 --> 18:27.356
<i>In SWAT, it's 10times more important.</i>
<i>It's critical.</i>

18:27.857 --> 18:31.193
<i>So push yourself to the limits here</i>
<i>and get used to it.</i>

18:40.494 --> 18:42.663
Come on, baby! Get up!

18:45.833 --> 18:47.043
Bring it in!

18:54.634 --> 18:56.886
Go! Go! Come on!

18:58.012 --> 18:59.138
Not bad, gentlemen.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.848
Now we get to the fun stuff.

19:05.603 --> 19:08.606
-Welcome to the Brewster Projects.
-We know where it is.

19:08.689 --> 19:09.940
Cutler, what are we doing here?

19:10.024 --> 19:11.734
This place's been abandoned
for, like, three years.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.195
-Diana Ross lived here.
-Yeah, and the Motown Sound.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.739
-Anyway, Diana moved back to LA.
-We know the history.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.617
This is a... What?
A fed training site, l guess. Right?

19:19.700 --> 19:23.746
That tower is where your
final FBl HRT certification will take place.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.790
-Never been in any of those.
-Yeah, that's why I picked it.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.750
I'm going to make it
very challenging for you guys.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.419
Next two weeks, you're going to be
spending a lot oftime in these projects.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.462
So learn to love it.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.798
Damn. I dated a girl that lived here once.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.133
Yeah! I remember that, actually.
What was his name?

19:36.509 --> 19:38.094
Screw you, Stockton.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.638
You were probably too worried about
catching an STD to even have sex.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.306
All right, playtime's over, guys. Let's go.

19:42.598 --> 19:43.891
Let's work.

19:47.103 --> 19:50.314
Old-school, "Precision is everything."

19:50.398 --> 19:51.649
"Take it slow and get it right?"

19:52.108 --> 19:54.652
Well, Mumbai and Virginia Tech

19:54.735 --> 19:56.612
and Columbine changed all that.

19:56.696 --> 20:00.282
Speed and accuracy are now
equally important. Rapid response.

20:00.616 --> 20:04.036
Tactical and precision are now generally
the same thing.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.955
So unlearn whatever they taught you
at SWAT school

20:06.038 --> 20:07.540
because shit happens fast today.

20:07.915 --> 20:10.334
Everything I teach you will be on the move.

20:10.418 --> 20:14.255
Nothing static. Target on the move.
Shoot on the move. Rescue on the move.

20:14.755 --> 20:15.923
And do it fast.

20:16.006 --> 20:18.342
Magazines should be emptied in 15 seconds.

20:18.426 --> 20:19.844
Accuracy and time counts.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.929
All right, let's suit up and go.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.931
Kellogg, go!

20:27.101 --> 20:29.103
Kneeling barricade position.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.444
Moving, moving!

20:38.320 --> 20:39.655
Change barricade.

20:40.614 --> 20:41.615
Hold, hold, hold.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.076
Behind you.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.787
-High-low firing position.
-Right behind you.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.873
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

20:48.956 --> 20:50.708
Forward firing position!

20:50.791 --> 20:51.792
Move it. Move it.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.388
Looking good, boys. Looking good.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.894
Now let's do it the hard way.
Watters, give him your MP3 player.

21:10.311 --> 21:14.064
Turn it up. Full blast.
You've just been shot in your good arm.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.651
You have four mags, 30 seconds.

21:18.903 --> 21:20.362
Hit the target.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.457
Taking too long,
and you're missing everything.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.541
Other than that, you're perfect.

21:34.168 --> 21:35.878
This is why we practice.

21:35.961 --> 21:39.507
<i>Requesting SWAT backup</i>
<i>at 1949 Barton Street.</i>

21:39.590 --> 21:44.094
<i>PR reports possible hostage with</i>
<i>barricaded suspect. Unknown assailants.</i>

21:44.178 --> 21:46.180
You guys ready,
or should I call in another unit?

21:46.388 --> 21:48.057
No, we're the A-team. We'll do it.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.518
-We're good.
-We got it.

21:50.601 --> 21:52.811
We're good. We'll be there in 15.

21:52.895 --> 21:55.064
You got a key for this thing?

22:18.838 --> 22:20.965
Got it, thank you. Thank you.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.968
Building security's sending through
floor plans and surveillance footage.

22:24.051 --> 22:26.387
-Mundy, on the laptop.
-All right.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.561
Got the video feed right here.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.438
All right. That's our suspect.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.357
He entered the north entrance
15 minutes ago.

22:38.732 --> 22:39.900
Name on the office door?

22:41.068 --> 22:43.237
-Command, Control, "M".
-I know. I got it.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.782
Here it is.
Rose Walker is our potential hostage.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.827
-Punch her up.
-She's a systems analyst for the firm.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.245
Recently moved from D.C.

22:51.328 --> 22:52.580
Any red flags?

22:52.830 --> 22:55.165
What else? What else? What else?
What else? Here we go.

22:55.249 --> 22:59.169
Filed a restraining order two weeks ago.
And it is the same guy.

22:59.253 --> 23:01.171
-Suspect's name is Walter Hatch.
-Right.

23:01.255 --> 23:02.923
Tap into the building's phone router
and ring her office.

23:03.007 --> 23:04.008
Already did.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.092
Good.

23:07.136 --> 23:10.431
-Ms. Walker?
<i>-Leave. Right now.</i>

23:10.514 --> 23:14.435
Hey, Walter. This is Sergeant Cutler.
Can I speak to Rose, please?

23:23.861 --> 23:24.862
What the hell does that mean?

23:25.738 --> 23:27.656
Hell if I know. Cover me.

23:28.449 --> 23:29.491
Got you.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.008
Hey, why are we talking on this phone?

23:46.091 --> 23:48.218
<i>Because you were taping the other phone.</i>

23:48.302 --> 23:49.803
You okay? You need anything?

23:49.887 --> 23:54.016
<i>Leave immediately. Otherwise,</i>
<i>this is going to get very ugly very quickly.</i>

23:54.099 --> 23:55.935
<i>We clear, asshole?</i>

23:56.644 --> 23:57.895
All right. We're going up.

23:57.978 --> 24:01.398
Full package. Gas, flash, dynamic entry.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.651
Watters, sniper into that building.

24:03.734 --> 24:05.194
-You know what a click command is?
-Yes, sir.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.820
I'm the best marksman. I'll take the roof.

24:06.904 --> 24:08.364
Watters, sniper into that building.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.532
-Hey, I'm a better shot. I'll take it.
-Hey, hey, hey!

24:10.616 --> 24:14.578
I just deployed an asset, Officer Kellogg.
You do not countermand me. Are we clear?

24:14.870 --> 24:17.414
Wolport, you man communications.
Everybody else with me.

24:17.498 --> 24:19.375
Move. Faster! Faster, guys.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.169
Let's go! Let's go! We got a job to do.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.756
Bench press 350 pounds to communicate.
Great.

24:28.759 --> 24:31.220
-Let's go. Showtime, man.
-Bring us home, man.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.248
I got up here.

24:59.873 --> 25:03.210
-Clear.
-Guys, guys! Stockton, Mundy,

25:03.627 --> 25:04.753
up to the roof.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.214
Prepared to repel and flash bang
on my command.

25:07.381 --> 25:08.757
-Got it?
-All right. Let's go.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.300
This way.

25:11.885 --> 25:13.303
<i>Watters, what's your status?</i>

25:14.221 --> 25:16.390
I'm on the eighth floor about to take position.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.983
-Hey, where's the roof access?
-Yeah, through there. Bythe stairwell.

25:26.400 --> 25:29.278
We got a hostage situation.
This is for your protection.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.613
Blow the glass.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.080
Drop the guns.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.124
Drop the guns.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.043
Hey, Walter. I'm the guy on the phone.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.544
This is a personal matter.

26:27.628 --> 26:28.754
You need to leave now.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.131
I'm not going to say it again!

26:31.632 --> 26:33.509
Shoot him. Please, shoot him.

26:35.010 --> 26:38.639
It's okay. Stay calm. You scared her.

26:39.389 --> 26:42.935
Everything's under control.
Now get out of here before this gets worse.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.645
It's already worse.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.355
Walter, you seem like a reasonable person.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.691
I am reasonable. She's safe now. Leave.

26:50.526 --> 26:53.153
Go, orwe're going to have bigger problems.
Do you understand me?

26:53.362 --> 26:55.989
Hey, man,
I know chicks can drive you a little crazy...

26:56.156 --> 26:58.033
Call an EMT unit.

26:58.742 --> 27:02.496
Walter, you know we can't leave.
So let's talk about what we can do.

27:02.955 --> 27:03.997
I'm going to count to three.

27:04.122 --> 27:05.415
Rose, stop moving.

27:05.749 --> 27:06.750
One.

27:08.627 --> 27:09.628
<i>Two.</i>

27:17.845 --> 27:19.012
We're code four up here.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.181
Little to the right next time!

27:22.432 --> 27:23.433
Should've let me take the shot.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.395
-Secure the hostage.
-Don't you touch her!

27:27.187 --> 27:28.188
Gun!

27:28.814 --> 27:29.898
Rose, it's okay.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.692
It's over. We're taking him away.

27:31.775 --> 27:32.818
Get out of the way.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.863
-Rose, listen to me.
-You can't let him live.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.906
You don't know what he is.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.199
What do you mean, Rose?

27:39.366 --> 27:42.786
He has to die. Please, get out ofthe way.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.330
Rose, it's okay now. Just breathe.

27:45.414 --> 27:46.456
It's just adrenaline.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.917
You don't understand. You can't stop him!

27:49.001 --> 27:51.879
I do understand. I do understand.

27:56.425 --> 27:57.426
No!

27:58.552 --> 28:00.137
No, Rose! No!

28:00.512 --> 28:01.513
Son ofa bitch!

28:03.098 --> 28:04.892
-Hostage down. Hostage down.
-Do not let her die!

28:05.100 --> 28:08.020
-Shut up, asshole. Shut up!
-Don't let her die! Don't let her die!

28:08.103 --> 28:10.230
-Secure the prisoner, God damn it.
-lf she dies,

28:10.731 --> 28:13.609
you're all going to die!
Every goddamn one of you!

28:18.238 --> 28:20.324
<i>We have a civilian wounded.</i>

28:31.293 --> 28:34.046
<i>You have one new message.</i>

28:34.129 --> 28:36.256
<i>Hey, Paul. It's Captain Simon.</i>

28:36.632 --> 28:38.217
<i>Heard what happened with the hostage.</i>

28:38.842 --> 28:40.928
<i>Listen, if you wantto</i>
<i>come back, decompress,</i>

28:41.011 --> 28:44.097
<i>we can push this certification thing</i>
<i>a few weeks.</i>

28:44.306 --> 28:46.183
<i>Call me if you want to talk.</i>

29:09.748 --> 29:11.291
You're about as subtle as a train wreck.

29:13.502 --> 29:18.507
I'll tell you something right now, though.
Today was some intense shit, yeah?

29:18.674 --> 29:20.008
Yeah.

29:20.801 --> 29:23.303
We gotto talk to Hollander about that guy.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.806
This is our team. Our town.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.225
What'd Cutler say to you?

29:28.475 --> 29:31.603
Didn't say anything.
I didn't do anything wrong.

29:32.646 --> 29:34.147
All I'm saying is, if I was on that roof,

29:34.231 --> 29:35.983
I would have calculated
for the angle of the glass.

29:36.066 --> 29:37.859
Hatch would be dead,
and that woman would still be alive.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.277
Dude, she'd be alive if you hadn't...

29:39.361 --> 29:41.279
You know what? You know what?
You know what?

29:41.363 --> 29:42.531
ltwas a tough shot, man.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.283
Which I would have made.

29:47.452 --> 29:50.831
Tell you one thing, though. lf that guy Cutler,
doesn't ease back a little bit,

29:50.914 --> 29:53.625
he might find himself caught in the crossfire,
you know what I'm saying?

29:53.709 --> 29:54.793
Here we go.

29:55.502 --> 29:56.670
What do they call that in the Army?

29:57.045 --> 29:58.171
-"Fragging an officer?"
-"Fragging an officer."

29:58.255 --> 30:01.383
-I think you've had a little too much to drink.
-Somebody's drunk.

30:01.466 --> 30:04.386
Paul actually served in the Army. lraq.
Two tours.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.013
I mean, Reserves, but then went active duty.

30:06.680 --> 30:07.973
Worked intel and recon.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.057
-"Paul."
-"Paul."

30:09.349 --> 30:11.601
-He's also vegan.
-Seriously?

30:12.019 --> 30:13.520
Hell of a day.

30:15.188 --> 30:17.399
Everyone did all right, considering.

30:19.192 --> 30:21.862
We did all right. You hear that, boys?

30:23.030 --> 30:24.698
But Paul lost his first hostage.

30:26.366 --> 30:27.534
Want a drink?

30:27.617 --> 30:30.746
No, and neither do you. You've had enough.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.373
It's off-hours, sir.
I think I can decide when I've had enough.

30:33.957 --> 30:36.460
You don't seem very happy that I'm here,
Officer Kellogg.

30:37.044 --> 30:39.671
What, in Detroit or in this bar?

30:40.255 --> 30:41.381
Both.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.218
You box?

30:45.510 --> 30:47.804
You challenging me to a fight?

30:48.055 --> 30:49.222
No.

30:49.806 --> 30:51.767
Just challenging you to a little game.

30:52.267 --> 30:55.687
Little contest. You beat me,
I'm on the first plane tomorrow morning.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.317
-You serious?
-Dead serious.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.402
Fragalicious.

31:04.821 --> 31:07.240
But if I win, you're off the team.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.870
-We got a match.
-It's on.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.163
You can take that one.

31:13.246 --> 31:15.540
-Don't let him beat you.
-Anytime.

31:17.542 --> 31:18.794
Power or speed?

31:19.378 --> 31:21.296
Power.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.885
Take your best shot.

31:29.596 --> 31:30.806
Get some.

31:35.060 --> 31:38.230
That's it, man. Nice hit. That's my man.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.275
First principle of crisis negotiation.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.779
lf you're not smarter
than the guy you're dealing with, you lose.

31:45.987 --> 31:47.072
You think I lost?

31:47.364 --> 31:48.698
Yeah, I do.

31:48.782 --> 31:51.701
You failed to utilize
the most effective strategy

31:51.785 --> 31:55.288
by not using the most available resources
to affect your outcome.

31:55.956 --> 31:57.457
Just take your swing.

31:58.583 --> 31:59.584
Hey!

32:12.180 --> 32:13.473
Yeah, well, you cheated.

32:13.765 --> 32:17.894
No, I didn't. I played to win.
You played to prove how tough you are.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.650
Rules of engagement in SWAT are simple.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.028
Defeat the enemy any way you can.

32:27.696 --> 32:29.573
You could have done the same thing I did.

32:29.656 --> 32:32.409
You should have.
But you didn't think about it.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.331
Clear out your locker tomorrow.

32:47.757 --> 32:49.468
-Hey!
-Cutler, come on, man.

32:49.551 --> 32:51.511
Call him a cab or drive him home. Got it?

32:51.887 --> 32:53.763
All right. All right. We got him.

32:53.847 --> 32:55.473
See you gentlemen in the morning.

32:56.016 --> 32:58.101
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Stop!

32:58.185 --> 32:59.519
Come on, man. Relax.

33:06.860 --> 33:09.362
I had enough of this day. I'm out of here.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.781
<i>Kellogg was the best man on the team.</i>

33:12.032 --> 33:13.366
Best shooter, best leader.

33:13.450 --> 33:16.536
He disobeys orders.
He's arrogant, compulsive.

33:16.620 --> 33:19.372
-He intimidates team members.
-This is Detroit!

33:19.456 --> 33:20.999
You can't fire somebody off my team.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.918
-I'm not certifying him!
-Then don't.

33:23.168 --> 33:25.128
He's working on Charlie Company
till you're gone.

33:25.212 --> 33:26.922
In the meantime, you're one man sho?.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.177
Pre-screened candidates. Pick one.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.470
I'd rather bring someone else in.

33:33.553 --> 33:34.638
For less than two weeks?

33:34.721 --> 33:37.224
You'll want to keep him after I'm gone.
They're that good.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.017
Who is this guy?

34:11.632 --> 34:13.927
Hope your little girl feels better.

34:17.847 --> 34:20.058
I was hoping you'd be ugly by now.

34:20.308 --> 34:21.935
And I was hoping you'd be cute.

34:25.146 --> 34:27.065
-How you doing, Lori?
-What up, P?

34:29.275 --> 34:30.277
Thanks for coming here.

34:30.568 --> 34:33.112
Easy. Didn't leave much behind.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.324
Do you know,
I was number four on Dallas SWAT?

34:36.949 --> 34:39.536
Then I move to Seattle for that jackass.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.581
Never date a cop.

34:43.415 --> 34:44.708
They'll break your heart, man.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.876
-Every time.
-You want me to shoot him? Take him out?

34:47.252 --> 34:49.629
Already did. He lived.

34:51.505 --> 34:52.966
Let's do it like Baghdad, baby.

34:53.967 --> 34:54.967
Yeah.

35:00.849 --> 35:03.393
Day four, gentlemen. Sniper school.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.897
I don't remember people looking like that
when I was in the Army.

35:07.981 --> 35:11.151
Shit. This is going to be hell.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.653
Or heaven.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.117
-Requests?
-Forehead.

35:22.996 --> 35:23.997
Call it.

35:25.332 --> 35:26.499
Nose.

35:31.630 --> 35:32.672
All right, guys.

35:33.465 --> 35:36.885
We're going to retrain youreye and hands
to move in one single motion.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.346
Now, you may lose a little accuracy,
but you'll gain a lot of speed.

35:39.763 --> 35:41.056
What's the advantage of that?

35:41.681 --> 35:43.016
Speed kills.

35:43.350 --> 35:45.602
Tactical sniping changed a bit in lraq.

35:45.685 --> 35:48.563
We found you could shoot a bit faster
than the old school thought or taught

35:48.647 --> 35:50.523
and still meet a high standard of accuracy.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.902
I really like the way you say that.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.905
Get your boy, P.

36:00.075 --> 36:01.618
What's the matter with you?

36:03.328 --> 36:04.454
Watters, right?

36:07.248 --> 36:08.625
Right eye.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.674
Very nice.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.551
Seattle.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.721
-Officer Mundy.
-Yeah.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.264
Left ear.

36:23.556 --> 36:25.016
Upside down.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.476
What?

36:26.559 --> 36:27.811
Upside down. Now.

36:27.894 --> 36:29.646
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

36:29.729 --> 36:32.399
Ridiculous. Grab me some of these bags.

36:36.277 --> 36:37.612
-Hold my feet, will you?
-I got it.

36:46.413 --> 36:47.872
Hey, Watters,

36:49.499 --> 36:50.708
that a hit or miss?

36:50.792 --> 36:52.377
I'd give itto him.

36:52.669 --> 36:55.422
That would be incorrect, Watters.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.299
So you want me to stay after class, now?

36:58.383 --> 37:00.093
Easy does it.

37:01.302 --> 37:02.929
-Officer Mundy.
-Yes.

37:03.346 --> 37:07.267
You accounted for wind, humidity and heat,
 just not drop ratio.

37:08.643 --> 37:11.271
That round is heavier than
a normal full jacket.

37:11.604 --> 37:14.023
Starts falling like a dead pigeon at 400 feet.

37:14.107 --> 37:15.108
Again.

37:16.109 --> 37:17.736
-Same target.
-Okay.

37:31.624 --> 37:34.544
-Hello?
<i>-Remember what I told you?</i>

37:34.627 --> 37:37.130
-Who is this?
<i>-It's Walter.</i>

37:37.797 --> 37:40.800
<i>Remember what I told you would happen</i>
<i>if she died?</i>

37:40.884 --> 37:44.512
<i>This is your fault. It's your fault she's dead.</i>

37:45.555 --> 37:48.725
You should have used your one phone call
to get a lawyer, asshole.

37:58.026 --> 38:01.738
Worst name for a baseball player ever.
Melky Cabrera.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.448
Melky. Sounds like discharge.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.992
Do that again.

38:09.871 --> 38:12.165
Did you hit something
or did something hit you?

38:12.332 --> 38:13.333
My wife, brother.

38:42.195 --> 38:46.282
The main objective of SWAT
in a barricaded suspect situation is what?

38:46.574 --> 38:47.575
Mundy?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.577
-To save lives.
-Correct.

38:50.036 --> 38:53.665
And what's the main objective of a terrorist
in a suspect situation? Stockton?

38:54.082 --> 38:56.459
To die and to take everybody with him.

38:56.543 --> 38:58.211
Correct. From the beginning,

38:58.294 --> 39:01.172
hostage rescue has always been about
saving lives, but the mission's changing.

39:02.006 --> 39:05.385
Your department's record on talking down
hostage takers, it's excellent.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.470
But I just want to make sure
that you're tuned up

39:07.554 --> 39:09.556
for the ones who can't be talked down.
Okay?

39:10.557 --> 39:12.141
Thirty minutes for lunch. Cool?

39:12.225 --> 39:13.977
-Is that good?
-Cool with me.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.019
Dude, watch it.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.104
-Watch what?
-The chair.

39:16.479 --> 39:17.647
You watch yourself.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.610
-Hey, there. How's it going?
-Hey.

39:23.111 --> 39:25.363
You were the arresting officer
on that suicide three nights ago?

39:25.446 --> 39:26.489
Yeah.

39:26.573 --> 39:27.907
Brought you your incident report.

39:27.991 --> 39:30.159
Doesn't the watch commander
usually bring the arrest reports?

39:30.243 --> 39:32.870
Yeah, I just...
I wanted to make sure you're adjusting okay.

39:34.581 --> 39:37.250
And you might not be smiling
after you read that.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.297
-He in there?
-Excuse me.

39:43.089 --> 39:44.549
Why was this lunatic allowed bail?

39:45.550 --> 39:48.803
He was deemed not to be a flight risk
and paid the cou?.

39:48.886 --> 39:49.887
Somebody died.

39:51.806 --> 39:54.851
She killed herself.
His bail was set at a million.

39:54.934 --> 39:56.936
He paid it!
Why are we even talking about this?

39:57.270 --> 40:00.648
He was waving a gun at police officers.
They should revoke his bail.

40:00.732 --> 40:05.570
We got killers, we got drug dealers
overwhelming our system.

40:05.653 --> 40:08.323
This is one step removed
from a domestic dispute.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.700
He had a gun in her office.

40:10.783 --> 40:13.578
lt was her gun registered to her.

40:13.661 --> 40:16.247
He claims he took it away from her
to protect her and himself.

40:17.999 --> 40:20.835
We played the 9-1-1 tape. He's not lying.

40:21.044 --> 40:22.462
Co-worker called it in.

40:22.545 --> 40:26.299
Said she was brandishing the gun
and he was the hostage.

40:35.642 --> 40:38.311
-You did the evaluation on Hatch?
-Yes.

40:38.645 --> 40:40.897
I requested a 72-hour mandatory hold.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.858
He was a stalker with a restraining order,
and the woman died.

40:43.941 --> 40:48.404
I agree. I requested a 5150 on Hatch.
Court didn't agree with me.

40:48.488 --> 40:49.572
See this?

40:49.656 --> 40:51.949
This is the pile of
the-court-didn't-agree-with-mes.

40:52.533 --> 40:55.161
-Welcome to Detroit, Paul Visitor.
-I think he's mentally unstable.

40:55.244 --> 40:56.871
So was she.

40:57.121 --> 41:00.792
Rose Walker was under
comprehensive psychiatric care.

41:01.668 --> 41:04.045
She's suicidal.
Yeah, it's probably related to him.

41:05.088 --> 41:07.799
Hatch has no record at all. He's clean.

41:08.508 --> 41:11.511
It's unbelievable.
Someone else is going to get hurt.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.516
Let me know
if there's anything else I can do for you.

41:24.357 --> 41:25.817
You can let me...

41:28.361 --> 41:30.071
You can let me buy you dinner.

41:30.530 --> 41:34.701
I've got... I've got way too much work to do.

41:35.034 --> 41:37.954
Sounds familiar.
But you do have to eat, though, don't you?

41:38.246 --> 41:39.497
A lot of the times I don't.

41:39.580 --> 41:43.084
How about tonight
you make an exception for the new guy?

41:43.793 --> 41:46.170
If I say yes, would you please shut up?

41:46.629 --> 41:49.841
-Yeah.
-Okay. Yes.

41:51.217 --> 41:52.343
Yeah.

41:58.599 --> 42:00.059
So why Detroit?

42:00.309 --> 42:04.147
lt was the best offer at the time
for a rookie police psychologist.

42:04.564 --> 42:06.357
-Why LA?
-Born there.

42:06.899 --> 42:07.942
Why a cop?

42:08.025 --> 42:10.570
Action, adventure, romance.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.030
Okay.

42:13.239 --> 42:15.908
You know, people who feel
the need to rescue other people

42:15.992 --> 42:17.744
are often running away
from their own problems.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.996
You help people.
What are you running away from?

42:22.749 --> 42:24.167
A relationship.

42:24.250 --> 42:25.585
Excuse me. May l?

42:25.668 --> 42:27.670
-Thank you.
-With who?

42:29.255 --> 42:30.715
Well, right now, with you.

42:31.591 --> 42:33.051
Who's looking for a relationship?

42:33.384 --> 42:35.428
Is this how you normally
talk your barricaded suspects out?

42:35.511 --> 42:36.512
You just wear them down?

42:36.596 --> 42:38.931
I'm not looking to win any negotiations here.

42:39.223 --> 42:40.558
Good.

42:41.768 --> 42:44.062
Because if you are looking
to get any action tonight,

42:44.145 --> 42:46.147
it's not going to happen.

42:48.107 --> 42:51.694
-This is insane. I never do things like this.
-Yeah, me neither.

42:51.778 --> 42:54.447
I mean, I've only known you, like, four hours.

43:17.804 --> 43:22.058
Tomorrow. 1200. Grand Circus Park.

43:31.025 --> 43:33.820
You are gonna make somebody a great wife.

43:35.112 --> 43:37.240
Okay, I think my manhood's
 just been questioned.

43:38.241 --> 43:40.535
Nobody is questioning that. Trust me.

43:40.993 --> 43:41.994
You see that?

43:45.706 --> 43:46.999
You're famous.

43:47.416 --> 43:48.417
You want to talk about it?

43:48.793 --> 43:49.794
No.

43:50.378 --> 43:51.379
You busy tonight?

43:51.462 --> 43:53.506
Yeah, I've gotta work tonight.

43:55.508 --> 43:57.176
What about tomorrow night?

43:58.094 --> 43:59.095
Meetings.

43:59.554 --> 44:00.805
You work too much. You know that?

44:01.305 --> 44:02.306
I know.

44:22.785 --> 44:26.747
Sir, do you know how hard it is to catch
a direct flight from Rio to Detroit?

44:26.873 --> 44:30.001
No, and I really don't care. Let's take a walk.

44:31.460 --> 44:33.629
I don't like rush jobs, Hatch.

44:33.713 --> 44:36.507
-Haven't told you what the job is yet.
-So tell me.

44:36.924 --> 44:38.968
-Remember Belgrade?
-Yeah.

44:39.552 --> 44:41.512
It's like that. Only bigger.

44:42.263 --> 44:43.723
So, this is approved?

44:44.223 --> 44:45.558
Was Belgrade approved?

44:46.559 --> 44:47.560
Who's the target?

44:47.935 --> 44:49.478
It's a need-to-know basis.

44:49.729 --> 44:51.647
Pay is the same as usual.

44:51.898 --> 44:54.192
Need you to get me everything on this list.

44:55.276 --> 44:56.277
Roger that.

45:03.451 --> 45:04.452
You guys have any idea

45:04.535 --> 45:08.414
how much lead, asbestos, carcinogens
and toxic mold is in this tower?

45:08.706 --> 45:11.167
-You're like a broken record, bro.
-Whatever, man.

45:11.250 --> 45:13.544
No, seriously, you can catch cancer
hanging around here.

45:13.753 --> 45:15.087
Yes, you can.

45:15.171 --> 45:16.839
Wear your gas mask. You'll be fine.

45:16.964 --> 45:18.758
That's why I have it.

45:19.884 --> 45:22.678
All right, time for our first walkthrough.

45:22.762 --> 45:25.348
I want you guys to memorize
every inch of this tower.

45:25.514 --> 45:26.849
Burn it into your brain.

45:26.933 --> 45:30.102
I want you all to pass this certification.
We got six days to go.

45:30.811 --> 45:32.521
Hey, is this gonna be a problem, sir?

45:32.605 --> 45:34.941
-No. No problem at all.
-Perfect.

45:38.736 --> 45:40.696
How's that patch coming?

45:40.863 --> 45:42.281
It ain't coming at all.

45:42.448 --> 45:45.451
-Look alive. Man-down drill.
-Slow and steady.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.623
-Keep your eyes open, guys.
-Look alive. Look alive.

45:50.706 --> 45:52.792
Speed it up just a tad, guys.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.002
Contact door.

45:55.127 --> 45:56.462
Contact window. Left. Quick.

45:57.129 --> 45:58.381
Contact door. Left.

45:58.464 --> 45:59.465
Contact door.

45:59.882 --> 46:00.883
Contact left window.

46:00.967 --> 46:02.301
-Contact left door.
-Contact window.

46:03.302 --> 46:04.720
-Left window.
-Contact window.

46:04.804 --> 46:06.055
Move, move.

46:06.138 --> 46:07.390
Contact left window.

46:11.644 --> 46:13.145
<i>Day eight. Here's the scenario.</i>

46:14.647 --> 46:17.483
<i>Barricaded suspects in the car,</i>
<i>possible hostages.</i>

46:19.318 --> 46:20.569
We split.

46:23.656 --> 46:24.907
Get on the ground.

46:24.991 --> 46:26.242
Hands up! Get out ofthe car.

46:26.492 --> 46:28.285
-Hands up.
-Secure him.

46:28.369 --> 46:29.370
Move it around. Move it around.

46:30.079 --> 46:31.330
Secure him.

46:32.707 --> 46:33.749
Good.

46:33.916 --> 46:34.917
<i>Welcome to day nine.</i>

46:35.418 --> 46:37.712
<i>Structured clearance</i>
<i>and close quarter combat.</i>

46:37.795 --> 46:39.088
<i>Everything counts double here.</i>

46:39.171 --> 46:40.339
-Contact door.
-Contact window.

46:43.884 --> 46:45.511
Down, down, down, down.

46:46.345 --> 46:47.555
Police.

46:54.228 --> 46:55.313
-Man.
-Shit.

46:55.396 --> 46:59.442
Time. And by "time", I mean you guys
took too much of it. Drill complete.

46:59.525 --> 47:00.526
What are you talking about?

47:00.609 --> 47:02.903
Listen, when you're clearing a structure,
it's like a dance.

47:02.987 --> 47:06.282
You need to be in sync, okay?
Thinking and moving as one.

47:06.866 --> 47:08.868
-Quickly.
-Man, I got shot, like, 50 times.

47:08.951 --> 47:11.954
Yeah, well, you need to learn to shoot
straighter or duck faster.

47:12.038 --> 47:14.540
Did any of you guys get a little tingle
in your throat? Don't laugh at me.

47:14.623 --> 47:16.083
You're not dying, Stockton. You're not dying.

47:16.167 --> 47:17.126
You don't think?

47:17.209 --> 47:18.461
-No, relax.
-Maybe.

47:18.753 --> 47:21.464
You would be dying from that girl
I saw the other night, if anything.

47:21.547 --> 47:22.548
-Exactly.
-Your mom.

49:43.105 --> 49:45.107
Got your message, asshole.

49:45.900 --> 49:48.110
The wallet on the table.

49:48.194 --> 49:49.445
You can have the jewelry.

49:50.488 --> 49:52.364
Sorry. Mistake. l...

49:53.073 --> 49:54.825
Police.

49:55.784 --> 49:57.620
-Yeah.
-It's okay.

50:09.548 --> 50:10.549
Yeah?

50:14.053 --> 50:17.890
<i>First you lose a hostage.</i>
<i>Now you break into the wrong house.</i>

50:18.307 --> 50:20.726
<i>I don't know if your reputation</i>
<i>is gonna survive.</i>

50:20.809 --> 50:23.103
-Yeah, well, I'm a survivor.
<i>-So am l.</i>

50:24.271 --> 50:26.732
<i>And I'll be going to your funeral.</i>

51:06.772 --> 51:10.609
We triangulated the call to a cell phone tower
about a block away. He was close.

51:11.235 --> 51:12.236
You get a number?

51:12.319 --> 51:15.781
Pre-paid cell phone.
Could have bought it anywhere. Untraceable.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.032
Google Earth?

51:17.116 --> 51:19.493
The last satellite image taken of this area
was 10 hours ago.

51:19.576 --> 51:20.619
Sir.

51:20.953 --> 51:22.246
C-4 and Semtex.

51:22.621 --> 51:24.832
This is military grade.

51:25.040 --> 51:26.875
This bomb would've taken out half the block.

51:26.959 --> 51:27.960
Thank you.

51:30.838 --> 51:32.131
-What's this?
-Plane ticket.

51:32.589 --> 51:34.508
I want you out of Detroit. Tonight.

51:36.635 --> 51:37.803
You're a target.

51:38.053 --> 51:40.472
Leaving won't stop him,
and I have a team to certify.

51:40.556 --> 51:41.724
I'm not going anywhere.

51:44.768 --> 51:47.229
Yeah, we're good. We're good.

51:56.739 --> 51:58.782
-Hey. What's up?
-We need to talk.

51:58.866 --> 52:00.909
-About what?
-Walter Hatch.

52:03.662 --> 52:05.873
Wait, he planted a bomb?

52:06.206 --> 52:09.209
Yeah, but he called me first. Warning me.

52:09.543 --> 52:13.005
I don't know if he's homicidal. l...

52:13.088 --> 52:16.258
Okay, the fact that he called you first,
put you on guard,

52:16.342 --> 52:19.845
it's almost like he wanted you
to look for the bomb.

52:19.928 --> 52:21.096
What am I dealing with here?

52:21.180 --> 52:25.184
Well, he's a high-functioning bipolar
borderline personalify.

52:25.768 --> 52:29.229
You know, I think that you have
become the object of his fixation.

52:30.189 --> 52:32.191
He was obsessed with Rose Walker.

52:32.274 --> 52:34.735
And now that she's gone,
he's transferred that obsession to you.

52:37.029 --> 52:38.530
You okay?

52:38.614 --> 52:40.366
I've never lost a hostage.

52:41.325 --> 52:42.493
Never.

52:44.703 --> 52:46.955
Ten years on SWAT. Never once.

54:03.782 --> 54:05.451
I like your shirt.

54:08.579 --> 54:09.621
I like your pants.

54:11.790 --> 54:15.127
So, how hard is this certification thing?

54:16.503 --> 54:17.963
It's no joke.

54:18.464 --> 54:20.215
-Any pointers?
-Yeah.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.135
Don't mess it up.

54:26.013 --> 54:30.476
So, when you and Cutler
were in lraq together,

54:31.643 --> 54:33.479
how was that, exactly?

54:34.438 --> 54:37.649
You mean, did he and I ever hook up?

54:39.067 --> 54:40.861
Not in so many words, but...

54:40.944 --> 54:42.863
Well, here's one for you.

54:43.906 --> 54:45.324
Never.

54:46.533 --> 54:47.743
No, for real.

54:47.826 --> 54:50.871
I mean, when you're
constantly getting shot at,

54:51.497 --> 54:54.208
the last thing you're thinking about is sex.

54:54.541 --> 54:55.667
Not us.

55:03.675 --> 55:05.302
Hey, you guys ready to get certified?

55:05.552 --> 55:06.845
Nice threads, Cutler.

55:07.429 --> 55:08.889
-You like that, huh?
-It's about time.

55:09.723 --> 55:11.266
-Looking good.
-Thanks.

55:11.850 --> 55:15.187
Now, I hope you guys all pass. Today.
Let's go.

55:17.815 --> 55:22.152
Today's exercise is based
on Quantico's FBl HRT criteria.

55:22.611 --> 55:25.447
lt will determine
your mission readiness as individuals,

55:25.531 --> 55:28.116
which will determine your readiness
for this team.

55:28.200 --> 55:32.371
Today's scenario. Unknown numberof
terrorists have taken over tower number one,

55:32.538 --> 55:34.122
and they're threatening to kill hostages.

55:34.456 --> 55:37.960
The top foor  apartment on the west wall
has been outfitted with mannequins,

55:38.043 --> 55:39.461
some with guns.

55:39.545 --> 55:41.547
Some are hostages, and some are bogeys.

55:42.089 --> 55:45.384
I'll be splitting you up into two groups.
Good guys and bad guys.

55:45.634 --> 55:50.013
<i>Central requesting SWAT</i>
<i>at 33490 Grand River.</i>

55:50.222 --> 55:52.516
<i>Multiple barricaded suspects,</i>
<i>automatic weapons.</i>

55:52.599 --> 55:54.226
Confirmed, dispatch. We're on ourway.

55:58.313 --> 55:59.690
<i>It's all his fucking fault.</i>

55:59.773 --> 56:01.733
<i>lfthis clerk would've just</i>
<i>remembered the combination,</i>

56:01.817 --> 56:04.152
<i>we'd have been out of here by now</i>
<i>and nobody would have got hurt.</i>

56:05.988 --> 56:09.408
Yes, and I totally understand.
You're absolutely right, Carlos.

56:09.491 --> 56:10.742
So let's not make this any worse.

56:11.326 --> 56:14.746
You release the hostages and walk on out,
we'll straighten this out.

56:17.916 --> 56:20.002
Yo, check this out. I want a car.

56:20.085 --> 56:23.505
I want a safe passageway,
and I want 50K in unmarked bills,

56:23.589 --> 56:25.257
or I blow these bitches' brains out.

56:25.340 --> 56:26.592
-You got it?
-I got it.

56:27.384 --> 56:28.385
The car's gonna take a while,

56:28.468 --> 56:30.512
so why don't you relax
and have yourself a beer?

56:30.721 --> 56:32.306
Are you making fun of me, asshole?

56:32.389 --> 56:35.058
<i>No, I am telling you,</i>
<i>if you want to walk out of there,</i>

56:35.142 --> 56:37.311
I can make it happen.
But you're gonna have to trust me.

56:37.394 --> 56:38.604
Do you trust me?

56:40.314 --> 56:41.440
Why should I trust you?

56:42.190 --> 56:43.817
Because I'm gonna save your life.

56:45.027 --> 56:47.070
<i>Give me the clerk, Carlos.</i>

56:54.286 --> 56:56.538
I'll give you the clerk
when you give me my car.

56:56.747 --> 57:00.042
Okay, but if he dies,
it's gonna be a lot harder to get your car.

57:00.292 --> 57:02.336
<i>You wantto make sure you get the car,</i>
<i>you give me the clerk.</i>

57:02.419 --> 57:06.340
Yo, if you try anything, I'll kill him,
and still got more hostages.

57:06.632 --> 57:07.674
<i>You're in charge, Carlos.</i>

57:08.258 --> 57:09.426
Yo, go get that old man, man.

57:09.635 --> 57:10.594
Yo, let's go.

57:10.677 --> 57:11.678
-Help him up.
-Help him up.

57:15.057 --> 57:17.017
Here comes Charlie Team.

57:19.311 --> 57:20.979
-Sir.
-Kellogg.

57:22.064 --> 57:23.065
You're gonna catch.

57:23.899 --> 57:24.900
Yes, sir.

57:30.822 --> 57:33.158
Let's go. Let's go.

57:41.959 --> 57:43.669
Get the fuck out there, old man.

57:44.378 --> 57:45.379
I got you.

57:48.965 --> 57:50.300
He's good.

57:55.514 --> 57:56.890
Fuck. Get that bitch.

57:57.516 --> 57:59.601
<i>Shit. A hostage just lost a fuse in there.</i>

57:59.768 --> 58:02.145
-We got coverage?
-Line of sight to two of them.

58:02.229 --> 58:03.939
Blind on Carlos. Behind an aisle.

58:04.022 --> 58:05.107
Damn!

58:06.191 --> 58:07.401
He's falling apart. We're going in.

58:07.484 --> 58:09.528
Full breach and blast.
Rear assault on my cue.

58:09.611 --> 58:10.737
Roger that.

58:10.821 --> 58:11.780
Where's my car?

58:11.863 --> 58:13.115
It's on the way, Carlos.

58:13.198 --> 58:15.200
We got five minutes. Just sit tight in there.

58:18.370 --> 58:23.166
Hostages are located four yards to the left
of the front door on the number three wall.

58:23.375 --> 58:24.835
<i>We're gonna have</i>
<i>a three-second window there.</i>

58:24.918 --> 58:26.211
<i>So let's make it count, all right?</i>

58:28.755 --> 58:31.591
We got people coming out!
People coming out. Go see those officers.

58:34.302 --> 58:35.846
What the fuck is that?

58:36.638 --> 58:39.015
Cutler, we got another phone
ringing in there.

58:39.391 --> 58:40.392
Carlos.

58:41.143 --> 58:43.270
Car... I just lost audio. Carlos?

58:44.354 --> 58:46.356
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo?

58:46.440 --> 58:47.524
<i>Your car's coming 'round the back.</i>

58:47.607 --> 58:49.067
Somebody cut that line!

58:49.401 --> 58:50.944
Somebody cut that damn line!

58:51.945 --> 58:53.864
<i>Go out the back. Right now.</i>

58:53.947 --> 58:55.741
No, I want my car in the front,
where I can see you.

58:55.907 --> 58:58.493
<i>-Then blowthe bitch's brains out!</i>
-What?

59:00.412 --> 59:01.413
No, please.

59:01.913 --> 59:05.083
No, no, not me. No.

59:05.625 --> 59:07.210
Where's my car? Where's my car?

59:10.172 --> 59:11.173
Lori?

59:12.632 --> 59:13.633
-No, please.
-Where's my car?

59:15.761 --> 59:17.137
I got the D.

59:21.850 --> 59:22.851
<i>Take it.</i>

59:34.154 --> 59:35.155
Come on!

59:38.450 --> 59:39.451
Drop your weapons!

59:39.534 --> 59:40.994
Guns down! Guns down!

59:41.077 --> 59:42.579
-Move now!
-Get down! Get down!

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.277
All clear.

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:51.231
So, I picked this up
through the open tactical mics.

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:53.859
I amplified it
and minimized background noise for you.

01:00:54.943 --> 01:00:56.611
<i>Then blow the bitch's brains out!</i>

01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:59.781
-How'd he do that?
-He blocked us.

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:00.949
Got our cell frequency.

01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:04.744
Then overrode the kill switch order
we put on the land line inside.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:06.788
I mean, he could have done it remotely
from almost anywhere.

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:07.873
You think you can trace it?

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:11.543
According to all phone company records,
no call was ever even made.

01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:13.336
I mean, he just erased it.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.006
I mean, first he plants a bomb, and nowthis.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.718
-Who is this guy?
-I don't know.

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.052
Tap every traffic, ATM,

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:23.096
and retail surveillance camera
in a 10-block radius.

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:25.265
I already did that, sir.

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.726
And nothing showed up. The guy's a ghost.

01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:38.737
Yeah?

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:42.449
<i>First, you lose a hostage.</i>
<i>Then you break into the wrong house.</i>

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.035
<i>Now you kill a guy who's trying to give up.</i>

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:50.040
You're having a rough week, Cutler.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:52.792
How's the certification coming?

01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:53.919
Fine.

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:57.714
I'm gonna find you, Walter.

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:01.384
And then what?

01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:04.304
I haven't done anything.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.139
<i>Not that you can prove.</i>

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:08.725
How do you know we didn't trace
the explosives to where you got them?

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:10.268
Because that's impossible.

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:12.520
<i>Which means you're bullshitting me.</i>

01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:14.940
Now you've lost my trust, Cutler.

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:21.696
That's a bad position
for a hostage negotiator to be in.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:23.782
I'm going to put a bullet in you, Walter.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:27.327
<i>Now, now, don't lose your cool.</i>

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:33.250
First rule of SWAT. "Never let your emotions
control your judgment."

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:39.255
Bet you haven't heard the sound
of a .50 cal since you left lraq.

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:45.637
It can kill a man through a wall
from a mile away.

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:49.140
<i>You never see it coming.</i>

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:50.809
You never hear it.

01:02:51.142 --> 01:02:52.477
<i>It just gets you.</i>

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:56.272
Rose died for your sins.

01:02:57.148 --> 01:02:59.651
Now you're going to die for yours.

01:03:02.362 --> 01:03:05.532
Come and get me, Walter.
We'll see who walks away.

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.980
Don't move! Do not move!

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.190
Just reaching for creds, Mr. Cutler.

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:40.692
Do it slow.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:44.904
We need to talk.

01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:47.157
Let me see that thing.

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:55.123
State Department? Was he not FBl?

01:03:55.206 --> 01:03:57.250
No, but we're the federal government.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:59.878
Let's cut the cloak-and-daggershit,
shall we?

01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:05.425
Okay, we've been in Detroit
for the last week looking for this man.

01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:07.344
Walter Hatch.

01:04:07.427 --> 01:04:08.845
Or whatever his real name is, right?

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.555
What exactly does Hatch do for you?

01:04:11.389 --> 01:04:13.975
Assignments of a sensitive nature.

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:15.351
So he's a spy?

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:19.105
CIA operative? NSA? Black Ops? What?

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:21.649
He's an asset. A very important one.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:24.361
One we can't afford to lose.

01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:27.655
Yeah, I think this guy's gone off the
reservation and doesn't wanna be found.

01:04:27.739 --> 01:04:29.949
Rose Walker. Was she a target of his?

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:31.743
No. Just a citizen.

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.621
She and Hatch had a relationship.

01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:37.749
He was obsessed with her, romantically.
He stalked her.

01:04:38.249 --> 01:04:41.461
It's the first time I've ever seen him show
any type of emotion at all.

01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:42.629
It didn't go well.

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:46.633
Rose was originally from Detroit.
She came back here to get away from him.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:48.510
Yeah, that didn't go well either.

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:50.261
Sergeant Cutler,
there's someone here to see you.

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:57.477
Hello, boys. How's the Beltway?

01:04:58.478 --> 01:04:59.479
Hatch.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:01.272
What are you doing here, Walter?

01:05:01.856 --> 01:05:02.941
These are for Kim.

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:09.280
-Hey, hey, hey! Back off! Back off! Back off!
-Back off! Back off!

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:10.907
Keep him off! Keep him off!

01:05:11.449 --> 01:05:12.409
Put that hand down!

01:05:12.492 --> 01:05:15.745
Inspector, I'd like to press assault charges
against this maniac.

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:18.123
He's been following you.
That's why you couldn't find him.

01:05:18.373 --> 01:05:20.125
-He knew you were here.
-Okay, we'll take it from here.

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:21.251
No. He's under arrest.

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:22.460
Now, you let it go, Cutler.

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:25.213
-You're just gonna let him walk out?
-It's the federal government's problem.

01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:26.881
-No, he's my problem!
-It's their call.

01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:28.383
Feds trump State. You know the rules.

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:29.551
He doesn't know the rules!

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:31.719
We'll be going. Come on. Let's go.

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:32.887
Couldn't keep him away from Rose.

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:34.180
You think you're gonna keep him
away from me?

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:35.473
Have a nice day, gentlemen.

01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:36.683
Would you step back?

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:40.186
You get this team certified,
and you get out of my city tomorrow.

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:42.355
Come on. I got this.

01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:44.899
It's over. Let it go.

01:05:45.108 --> 01:05:47.360
No, it's not over.
You don't understand guys like this.

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:49.696
I don't? I shrink heads for a living.

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:51.114
He's gonna come after you.

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:52.615
Paul,

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.827
he's focused on you, okay? Not me.

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:59.581
-That type of transference, it's not typical...
-He knows that

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:01.499
I care about you.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:08.673
You care about me? You just met me.

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:12.260
-Don't do this.
-Do what?

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:13.344
This.

01:06:41.247 --> 01:06:42.332
Fry?

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:44.375
Not hungry.

01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:47.921
So what's the job?

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:50.715
There is no job.

01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:53.676
But they want you back in Washington
in case there is.

01:06:54.052 --> 01:06:55.762
You know you need to get over her, right?

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:58.181
She's gone.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:00.600
And you work for the govemment.

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:03.144
Suck it up and move on.

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:04.479
lt was none of your business.

01:07:04.979 --> 01:07:06.814
You scared her.

01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:09.234
Hey, we were trying to help you.

01:07:10.235 --> 01:07:12.862
You're very important to your country.

01:07:14.405 --> 01:07:16.032
She was very important

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.660
to me.

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:22.288
Her name was Rose.

01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:28.670
Hey, Paul.

01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:30.672
-Who's tailing her?
-I got Mani and Rattan on that.

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:32.674
-Who's watching her at work?
-Bayless and Thayer.

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:34.842
She never leaves your sight, understand?

01:07:34.926 --> 01:07:37.178
He shows up, shoot him. Ask questions later.

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:38.346
Okay.

01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:43.142
Yeah?

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:46.771
<i>Cutler, you better get over here</i>
<i>to Beaubien and Monroe.</i>

01:07:52.110 --> 01:07:54.112
Hold on a sec.

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:56.739
He took them both out.

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:02.870
Cutler, who the hell is this guy?

01:08:04.122 --> 01:08:06.958
So, Mundy, go inside right now
and don't let herout of your sight.

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:08.376
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:11.921
Hey, Mundy.

01:08:32.483 --> 01:08:34.527
<i>Hi, this is Kim. Leave a message.</i>

01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:44.287
Mundy? Hey.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:57.258
No.

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:10.729
Yeah, officer down.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:14.317
Kentolin and Elm. 1035 Elm.

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:21.948
Government recon satellite access.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:26.037
We got real-time NSA shots
over the feds' car and Kim's house.

01:09:26.203 --> 01:09:28.497
-He disappeared underground.
-How's Mundy?

01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:31.000
OR. Don't know.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:33.211
Doesn't look good.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:34.879
You let Hatch walk out of here.

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:36.964
-You know, you let him go.
-I told you to go home.

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:38.383
This would have never have happened.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.301
I am revoking your deputization.

01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:43.054
You no longer have any authorify
in this department. Go home.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:45.932
What are you doing to find her?
Why isn't the FBl here?

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:48.393
I am waiting for Washington
to advise me on the situation.

01:09:53.314 --> 01:09:54.482
-He's gone, I'm gone.
-Fine.

01:09:54.649 --> 01:09:56.651
Then you're both gone.
You're next in seniority.

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:59.529
You're team leader now.

01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:05.827
You stupid son of a bitch.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.454
We're a team, sir.

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:15.253
This is nobody's fight but mine.

01:10:15.962 --> 01:10:17.255
You sure about this, P?

01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:19.340
Make me proud.

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:22.176
Okay.

01:10:24.178 --> 01:10:25.638
<i>Requesting SWAT back-up.</i>

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:28.141
<i>Jumper at Seventh and Woodward.</i>
<i>The construction site.</i>

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:30.685
Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go.

01:10:31.477 --> 01:10:33.729
All right, fellows. Let's go. Let's gear up.
Come on.

01:10:40.945 --> 01:10:43.364
-Where are the first responders?
-Don't know.

01:10:43.448 --> 01:10:44.991
Supposed to be here
to lock down the perimeter.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.909
Well, we'll spank them later.

01:10:47.118 --> 01:10:49.120
Let's get this guy down.

01:10:49.203 --> 01:10:53.875
All right, y'all. We got a white male, 30s,
threatening suicide on the fourth floor.

01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:56.002
-Is he armed?
-Could be, so look alive.

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:58.838
Look, if he's a local, I might be able
to connect with him better.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:01.090
Good. You take him.

01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:02.383
Stockton, cover the floor above him.

01:11:02.467 --> 01:11:03.843
-I got the one below him.
-Got it.

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:06.220
-Wolport...
-Man the van? I know.

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:07.972
I'm the van man.

01:11:08.055 --> 01:11:11.100
Hey, let's do this for Mundy.

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:15.813
Let's do it.

01:11:23.154 --> 01:11:24.655
<i>Stockton, what you got down there?</i>

01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:26.699
Downstairs clear.
Moving toward the forewall.

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:30.411
<i>Watters, check in.</i>

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:32.497
Hold on. I got movement up here.

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:35.082
<i>-Wolport, what's our back-up status?</i>
<i>-Working on it.</i>

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:36.834
Found our jumper.

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.045
We're here by ourselves.
Are you sending back-up?

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.255
<i>Negative. No jumper call</i>
<i>came through our switchboard.</i>

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:43.508
Sir, show me your hands, sir.

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:45.885
Listen, sir. I'm here to help you.

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.178
Who called this in?

01:11:47.386 --> 01:11:49.096
<i>Not us. No call came through here.</i>

01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:50.890
You wouldn't happen to have a smoke,
would you?

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.017
Yeah, I got one.

01:11:59.607 --> 01:12:02.026
Son ofa bitch. Watters!

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:35.560
Hey! Don't move! Don't move!

01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:37.979
Wolport. They got Lori.

01:12:50.741 --> 01:12:53.077
Stockton, you there? Watters?

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.458
Send back-up now!

01:13:18.352 --> 01:13:20.563
<i>I can see why you like her so much.</i>

01:13:20.771 --> 01:13:24.150
-Walter, if you touch her...
<i>-Threats won't save her.</i>

01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:26.360
<i>Or your team.</i>

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:28.279
<i>I have them all now.</i>

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:31.240
Look, whatever you want, you got it.

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:32.908
You want me? You got it.

01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:35.202
<i>That's not much of a negotiation.</i>

01:13:35.286 --> 01:13:36.954
<i>Here's what I want, Paul.</i>

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:39.498
<i>Absolutely nothing.</i>

01:13:39.582 --> 01:13:42.168
<i>But I'm gonna give you the chance</i>
<i>you never gave me.</i>

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.462
<i>To save your girlfriend's life.</i>

01:13:44.545 --> 01:13:47.381
<i>I kill the first of your team in 30 minutes.</i>
<i>Training site.</i>

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:49.675
Come alone or I kill them all.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:16.494
I heard what happened tonight.

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:19.330
You don't have to steal anything.
Take whatever you need.

01:14:20.039 --> 01:14:21.248
I'm going with you.

01:14:22.333 --> 01:14:24.710
I can't. Hatch will know.

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:51.862
Lights and siren. You're gonna need it.

01:14:58.035 --> 01:15:00.079
Kill that son of a bitch!

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:16.512
<i>Call the other units.</i>

01:15:20.224 --> 01:15:21.559
You all right?

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:52.715
You broke your leg. You're staying here.

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:53.924
No.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:56.427
No way.

01:15:56.927 --> 01:15:58.012
You can't walk.

01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:05.603
You see anything. You shoot it.

01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:18.657
<i>You're bait, you understand?</i>

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.994
Don't kill Cutler. He's mine.

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:26.457
Watters, get back. Get back!

01:17:23.722 --> 01:17:24.849
<i>Nice shooting, ace.</i>

01:17:25.683 --> 01:17:27.101
<i>You might wanna save some ammo.</i>

01:17:27.852 --> 01:17:30.563
<i>I'm pretty sure the first one got him.</i>

01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:33.065
Walter, talk to me, God damn it.

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:35.067
<i>ls that emotion I hear, Paul?</i>

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:36.986
<i>First rule of SWAT HRT,</i>

01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:39.363
"Don't get emotionally involved."

01:17:39.864 --> 01:17:42.950
<i>lf you care too much,</i>
<i>it impairs your judgment.</i>

01:17:43.033 --> 01:17:45.244
<i>Starting to feel for these people, Paul?</i>

01:17:45.369 --> 01:17:46.370
<i>Not good.</i>

01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:48.914
<i>Now your certification just got harder.</i>

01:17:58.549 --> 01:18:00.342
<i>Welcome to the endgame.</i>

01:18:01.969 --> 01:18:06.390
Two lives. You have five minutes
before they're both dead.

01:18:06.724 --> 01:18:07.725
<i>So much to do.</i>

01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:10.269
<i>So little time.</i>

01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:13.522
Speed and accuracy count.

01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:17.526
Third floor utility room.

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:07.910
IED, Cutler. Like old times. Radio and phone!

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:10.913
It's got a back-up remote detonator
in a collapsing circuit.

01:19:11.038 --> 01:19:13.040
Check the point of ignition from the primer.

01:19:13.123 --> 01:19:15.125
It's Semtex. I can smell it.

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:17.836
There's not enough time to defuse it.

01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:19.129
What?

01:19:19.546 --> 01:19:21.340
-Move me.
-CO2. I'll freeze it up.

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:22.675
We'll load it on the timer.

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:24.134
Don't breathe.

01:19:30.015 --> 01:19:31.225
Hurry.

01:19:32.059 --> 01:19:34.103
-Damn, we'll have to cut one.
-Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

01:19:34.228 --> 01:19:35.437
Wait. Not that one.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.523
No, no, no, no.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:40.818
Hey, look in my eyes.

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:48.450
There we go!

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.374
If I were a girl, I'd kiss you.

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:59.044
Get this. Give me a gun.

01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:02.464
We lost Watters. He's dead.

01:20:03.173 --> 01:20:04.925
-What?
-He's going to kill Kim.

01:20:05.426 --> 01:20:06.802
That's his endgame.

01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:08.679
He's going to make me watch her die.

01:20:09.346 --> 01:20:10.973
-Where is she?
-Eighth floor.

01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:12.808
Where I set up the certification test.

01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:15.102
You remember that ceramic factory
outside of Ramadi?

01:20:15.185 --> 01:20:16.228
I got you. Give me 80.

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:17.521
You got 60.

01:20:17.604 --> 01:20:18.689
Shit!

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:27.948
<i>lmpressive.</i>
<i>But I expected you to pass that, Sergeant.</i>

01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:30.951
<i>Don't forget your girlfriend.</i>

01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:34.580
You have one minute
before I put a bullet in her head.

01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:55.893
Hurry, Paul!

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.145
Precision and speed!

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:06.737
Ten seconds, Paul!

01:21:08.072 --> 01:21:09.073
Nine seconds!

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:15.704
Welcome to your final test!

01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:21.335
Shoot me, Paul.

01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:28.217
If I die, I let go.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.803
If I let go, Kim's vest blows.

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:36.850
Not so easy this time, is it?

01:21:37.434 --> 01:21:40.646
Not as easy as when you killed Rose, is it?

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:42.940
Is it?

01:21:44.274 --> 01:21:45.734
Answer me, God damn it!

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:47.236
What do you want, Walter?

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:51.115
I want you to stop me from killing myself.

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:56.286
Talk me out of it.

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:59.289
It's not often you get to relive history, is it?

01:22:00.624 --> 01:22:02.251
Walter.

01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:05.754
Talk me out of killing myself.

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:58.158
Mundy's gonna make it,
but he's not coming back to SWAT.

01:23:58.992 --> 01:24:00.035
You should bring Kellogg back.

01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:02.621
What about you?

01:24:02.913 --> 01:24:04.915
I don't work here, remember?

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:06.875
Well, maybe you should consider it.

01:24:08.794 --> 01:24:10.003
No.

01:24:11.964 --> 01:24:14.299
I'm going home. But thanks anyway.

01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:17.386
And what about their certification?

01:24:18.595 --> 01:24:20.305
Consider them certified.

01:24:22.266 --> 01:24:23.267
Thank you.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.916
I guess you're gonna be
off SWAT duty a while?

01:24:49.459 --> 01:24:52.045
You have any interest
in seeing your sister in Long Beach?
