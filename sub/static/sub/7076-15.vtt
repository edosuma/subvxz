I never thought I'd miss it.

00:08.205 --> 00:10.720
How come I'm not best friends
with anyone in the group?

00:10.840 --> 00:11.885
Aw!

00:12.005 --> 00:13.418

Just letting the students know

00:19.592 --> 00:21.225
that if you're on campus
this weekend,

00:21.293 --> 00:23.027
you'll have to park
on the street

00:23.095 --> 00:24.529
because of the carnival.

00:24.597 --> 00:27.398
On an unrelated note,
I'm into trains now.

00:27.466 --> 00:28.967
A real carnival?

00:29.034 --> 00:31.235
Is the company called
red beard's amusements?

00:31.303 --> 00:32.503
Name rings a bell.

00:32.570 --> 00:33.937
But with me,
that could mean anything.

00:34.005 --> 00:35.772
I wonder.

00:35.840 --> 00:38.174
I have an ex-boyfriend
that travels with a carnival.

00:41.646 --> 00:42.946
I'm sorry, Britta.

00:43.014 --> 00:44.715
Some things are funny
because they make no sense.

00:44.782 --> 00:46.850
And that is not one of them.

00:46.918 --> 00:50.252
Well, it looks like my news
has incited some doings.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.522
And if that's not my job,
what is?

00:52.589 --> 00:55.224
Choo choo!

00:55.291 --> 00:57.459
Well, you're also
supposed to--

00:57.528 --> 01:00.095
Eh.
Administrate the school.

01:00.163 --> 01:03.032
So, Britta, tell us about
your carnival worker boyfriend.

01:03.099 --> 01:04.866
Why, so you all can get
a big laugh?

01:04.934 --> 01:06.067
- Yeah.
- I'd love to have a laugh.

01:06.135 --> 01:07.268
The exact reason.

01:07.336 --> 01:09.504
Fine.
I'm not ashamed of my past.

01:09.572 --> 01:10.906
And if it entertains you guys,

01:10.973 --> 01:13.474
that's great
because we're friends.

01:13.543 --> 01:15.109
His name is Blade and...

01:16.546 --> 01:17.712
What?
Oh, no, Britta!

01:17.780 --> 01:20.114
She invoked friendship
to undercut the laugh,

01:20.182 --> 01:22.382
and we're still laughing.
That's how funny it is!

01:22.450 --> 01:24.117
His name is Blade.
Is that legal?

01:24.185 --> 01:25.519
Shouldn't new line cinema
be suing him?

01:25.587 --> 01:27.821
He was called that
before that stupid movie.

01:27.889 --> 01:30.691
He was called that
before the fantastic movie.

01:30.759 --> 01:32.192
And it was a marvel comic
in 1973.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.460
Well, nerd alert.

01:33.528 --> 01:35.262
Well, ex-boyfriend named
Blade alert.

01:36.531 --> 01:39.198
Her love life makes Pierce
seem with it.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.600
Her pain unifies us.

01:40.668 --> 01:43.102
She has the king Arthur
of bad taste in men.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.171
I'm glad you guys
are reacting this way.

01:45.238 --> 01:47.707
I need to be reminded
that he is the worst on earth.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.876
Because if he comes
through town and calls me,

01:49.944 --> 01:51.477
I will be there
in five minutes.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.912
- I don't understand.
- Uh, Andre much?

01:53.980 --> 01:55.814
- Okay, I understand.
- I don't.

01:55.882 --> 01:56.949
- You will.
- What's that mean?

01:57.016 --> 01:58.817
- He's hung.
- Oh, God!

01:58.885 --> 02:00.118
Pierce, you're disgusting.

02:00.186 --> 02:01.620
Just like that
I'm disgusting again.

02:01.688 --> 02:04.790
I was one of the gang.
It was in my hand.

02:04.857 --> 02:06.524
Sometimes, a woman meets a man

02:06.593 --> 02:08.493
that she just can't shake
from her system

02:08.561 --> 02:10.193
no matter much
she knows better.

02:10.261 --> 02:12.463
I lucked out with Andre,
but God help me.

02:12.530 --> 02:14.198
As you all know, there's not
a lot he couldn't get away with.

02:14.265 --> 02:17.034
So what, Britta?
You're in love with a guy

02:17.102 --> 02:19.003
who's named after
a kickboxing vampire movie?

02:19.071 --> 02:21.639
A fantastic kickboxing
vampire movie.

02:21.707 --> 02:24.975
No, I don't believe in love
because of this guy...

02:25.042 --> 02:27.376
Named after
a kickboxing vampire movie.

02:27.444 --> 02:28.778
Oh, Britta!

02:28.846 --> 02:30.413
Oh, sweetie.

02:30.481 --> 02:31.414
You wanna watch <i>Blade</i> tonight?

02:31.482 --> 02:32.616
Yes.

02:32.683 --> 02:36.653

02:36.721 --> 02:39.555

Ugh, I <i>love</i> that I have
a locker now.

03:01.944 --> 03:03.611
All that wasted time going
to my car

03:03.679 --> 03:05.847
for mid-afternoon wardrobe
adjustments.

03:05.914 --> 03:08.516
What do you think, hmm?
Stick with what's working?

03:08.583 --> 03:09.684
You're gonna change your shirt?

03:09.752 --> 03:11.218
Not if it's working.

03:11.286 --> 03:13.286
- It's not working.
- Yeah.

03:13.354 --> 03:15.321
You're right.
I knew it.

03:15.389 --> 03:18.224
- I'll have what she's having.
- Hey, grow up, lady!

03:18.292 --> 03:20.727
- Annie!
- His shirt wasn't working!

03:20.795 --> 03:22.095
I need your help.

03:22.163 --> 03:23.530
It Blade's carnival
that's coming.

03:23.597 --> 03:25.565
He's working the BB gun
duck-shooting gallery.

03:25.633 --> 03:27.467
I guess he finally got
the promotion.

03:27.535 --> 03:28.901
And he will call me.

03:28.969 --> 03:30.269
And left unattended,

03:30.336 --> 03:32.271
I will end up doing him
like a crossword,

03:32.338 --> 03:33.839
and I will regret it.

03:33.907 --> 03:35.174
So I need you to take my phone,

03:35.241 --> 03:36.508
and don't give it back
until Monday!

03:36.576 --> 03:37.509
Of course.
Okay.

03:37.577 --> 03:39.011
- For real?
- Pipe it!

03:39.079 --> 03:41.113
And I need to stay with you
this weekend.

03:41.181 --> 03:43.883
Not just stay with you,
I need to be on lockdown.

03:43.950 --> 03:46.484
You were a pillhead,
so think of Blade as Adderall.

03:46.552 --> 03:48.219
And handcuff me to the radiator

03:48.287 --> 03:50.722
like a mother-flipping
carny-banging werewolf.

03:50.790 --> 03:52.256
I got this.
I got this.

03:52.324 --> 03:53.591
Our apartment
has central heating,

03:53.659 --> 03:55.226
but I get the idea--
stay strong.

03:55.294 --> 03:57.762
Man, I wonder how many women
I've affected this way.

03:57.830 --> 03:58.963
Ha ha!

04:02.801 --> 04:04.201
Whoo whoo!

04:04.268 --> 04:06.469
All aboard
the human being railway!

04:06.537 --> 04:08.271
Next stop, spo--

04:08.339 --> 04:09.740
- I'll get to the point.

04:09.808 --> 04:11.408
I'd like your student
Troy Barnes

04:11.475 --> 04:13.877
enrolled in the air conditioning
repair program immediately.

04:13.945 --> 04:17.079
Oh, a wonderful opportunity
for a young man of...

04:17.147 --> 04:18.680
Urban race.

04:18.749 --> 04:21.649
Yet try as I might, I'm unable
to make him see it that way.

04:21.719 --> 04:24.553
I need you to change his mind.

04:24.621 --> 04:26.756
But if he's not interested,
what can I do?

04:26.824 --> 04:29.325
Dean, have we forgotten
that your school

04:29.392 --> 04:31.828
is under the ac repair
school's thumb?

04:31.895 --> 04:33.294
Uh, we have not.

04:33.362 --> 04:36.497
Then mine is not to tell you
how to do what I want done.

04:36.565 --> 04:38.133
Mine is to want

04:38.201 --> 04:41.002
and to say my want.

04:41.070 --> 04:42.938
Yours is to know and to do.

04:43.005 --> 04:44.639
I know exactly what to do.

04:47.443 --> 04:52.646
Natalie, could you get me a,
um, book on how to do things?

04:52.714 --> 04:54.749
You know what,
just make me a scotch and soda.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.650
- Make it yourself!
- I don't know how.

04:58.319 --> 04:59.720
I love Blade's
special Blade weapons.

04:59.788 --> 05:01.588
Yeah, see that sword?
It has two blades.

05:01.656 --> 05:02.823
One blade is silver,

05:02.891 --> 05:03.991
the other blade is infused
with garlic.

05:04.059 --> 05:05.992
- I should check my messages.
- No.

05:06.060 --> 05:08.427
Guys, could we maybe
watch a different movie

05:08.495 --> 05:10.630
or just stop saying that word
six times per minute?

05:10.697 --> 05:11.998
- What word?
- Blade.

05:12.066 --> 05:13.199
Oh, because of
Britta's ex-boyfriend.

05:13.267 --> 05:14.567
Can you check my messages
for me

05:14.635 --> 05:15.769
and tell me if he called?

05:15.836 --> 05:17.036
I don't think
that's a good idea.

05:17.104 --> 05:18.371
What if my mother died?

05:18.438 --> 05:20.273
You guys are really
talking over <i>Blade.</i>

05:20.340 --> 05:22.607
- Not cool!
- Annie, subdue your guest.

05:22.675 --> 05:24.309
Annie, think for one second.

05:24.377 --> 05:26.544
You have my phone,
and you're not even checking it.

05:26.612 --> 05:27.880
What if my mother is dying?

05:27.947 --> 05:29.281
This is junkie talk.

05:29.348 --> 05:30.749
You just wanna know
where your phone's hidden.

05:30.817 --> 05:32.284
I just wanna know
if my mother is dying.

05:32.351 --> 05:34.987
It's a simple yes or no.
I'll cover my eyes.

05:35.054 --> 05:36.588
You go check my phone and say,

05:36.656 --> 05:39.556
"No, your mother isn't dying"
or "Yes, your mother is dying,"

05:39.624 --> 05:43.094
and then we go back
to watching the film.

05:56.674 --> 05:58.374
That's right, Britta.
It's a banana.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.877
Why is there a banana
in your DVD cabinet?

06:00.945 --> 06:03.313
Read the banana, Britta.

06:03.380 --> 06:05.381
"You are a lying junkie."

06:05.449 --> 06:06.883
I'm sure those words hurt.

06:06.951 --> 06:10.152
But you wouldn't be reading them
if they weren't true.

06:10.220 --> 06:13.655
I am so weak.

06:13.723 --> 06:16.591
But we are not defined
by our limitations.

06:16.659 --> 06:18.928
We are defined
by our potentials.

06:18.995 --> 06:20.495
I have the potential
to watch <i>Blade.</i>

06:20.563 --> 06:23.065
You two are bad friends!
Bad.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.333
That's unfair.
What about you guys?

06:25.400 --> 06:27.802
Okay, you don't like our movie,
we can't say the word "Blade,"

06:27.870 --> 06:29.370
there's phones
in the refrigerator.

06:29.438 --> 06:30.839
Oops.

06:30.906 --> 06:33.074
- Troy, Abed!
- Let me see if he called!

06:33.142 --> 06:35.376
I have a right to know!
You're monsters!

06:35.444 --> 06:38.112
You're Hitlers!
You're racist pedophiles!

06:38.180 --> 06:40.081
You're the opposites of Batman!

06:40.149 --> 06:41.414
You don't know what that means.

06:41.482 --> 06:43.583
Gonna rip out your throats
and eat your--

06:43.651 --> 06:45.052
Still think the lock
was overkill?

06:45.119 --> 06:46.786
No.

06:46.855 --> 06:48.788
There's
phones in the refrigerator.

I will stop letting you

Look what Pierce won me.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.954
What is this?

07:27.022 --> 07:29.334
I decided to go outside
the group for a best friend.

07:29.454 --> 07:30.754
And you couldn't do better
than Chang?

07:30.821 --> 07:31.921

We will.

07:38.962 --> 07:40.229
What do you wanna do next?

07:40.297 --> 07:41.531
- Cotton candy?
- Russian roulette?

07:41.598 --> 07:44.167
- What did you say?
- Cotton candy sounds great.

07:45.735 --> 07:48.671
Oh, thank you.

07:52.141 --> 07:54.309
That's it?
Huh.

07:54.377 --> 07:56.178
Hmm. He's not
as good-looking as you.

07:56.245 --> 07:57.845
- I wasn't fishing for that.
- No, no, no.

07:57.913 --> 08:00.382
I offered it freely.
Come on, I wanna go on a ride.

08:00.449 --> 08:01.550
This is a window for me.

08:01.617 --> 08:03.017
I spent my carnival years
pregnant.

08:03.085 --> 08:04.352
Shirley, I'm not jealous.

08:04.420 --> 08:05.787
I just wanted to see
what the deal was.

08:05.854 --> 08:07.621
Obviously the deal is
he's a dirtball,

Britta hates herself, voila.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.124

08:20.134 --> 08:22.902
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

08:22.969 --> 08:25.037
Great, actually.
Thank you, Annie.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.539
I could've never done this
without you.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.107
I'm glad to be able
to help you.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.442
I want you to know--

08:29.510 --> 08:30.610
and I've never said
these words--

08:30.678 --> 08:32.044
but I've always felt them.

08:32.111 --> 08:33.212
You're a sister to me.

08:34.748 --> 08:37.049
Britta!

08:37.116 --> 08:39.784
Whoo!

08:39.852 --> 08:41.186
Hey, little sis,

08:41.254 --> 08:43.087
do you think you could trust me
to have my phone back now?

08:43.155 --> 08:44.789
I've got my email on there,

08:44.857 --> 08:47.158
my calendar,
homework assignments.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.460
I'm kinda screwed without it.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.795
You're not just
manipulating me, right?

08:50.863 --> 08:53.665
Oh, because of...
Oh, jeez.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.933
Yeah, whatever.
That's over, Annie.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.101
Seriously.

08:57.168 --> 08:59.604
Okay, I have it right here.

08:59.671 --> 09:01.439
It's a gateway
to further trust.

09:01.506 --> 09:02.940
Perfect.
Thank you.

09:03.007 --> 09:07.278
Love the gateway.
Honoring the gateway.

09:07.346 --> 09:09.847
I have to call my doctor
for some results.

09:09.914 --> 09:12.148
Don't worry, I'm fine.
It's just a little personal.

09:12.216 --> 09:15.285
You need privacy, sure thing.
I'll check on you later.

09:15.353 --> 09:17.820
Bye.
Thank you, sweetie.

09:21.792 --> 09:24.060
Boy, this guy doesn't
give vampires

09:24.128 --> 09:25.428
a square inch of leeway.

09:25.496 --> 09:26.862
He's harsh.

09:29.299 --> 09:31.233
What's wrong, Annie?

09:31.301 --> 09:32.601
You came out of the bedroom
smiling,

09:32.669 --> 09:34.803
and then your smile faded
as you leaned against the door.

09:34.871 --> 09:36.405
I gave Britta her phone.

09:36.473 --> 09:38.140
You did?
Why?

09:38.207 --> 09:40.376
She needs to feel trust
to recover, or she'll relapse.

09:40.443 --> 09:42.443
She's gonna relapse
because you gave her her phone.

09:42.511 --> 09:44.679
No, I secretly switched
Blade's number in her phone

09:44.747 --> 09:46.013
to my number.

09:46.081 --> 09:47.315
So if she tries to get
in touch with him,

09:47.383 --> 09:49.016
- it'll come to me.
- That's diabolical.

09:49.084 --> 09:50.685
Yeah,
you're just like Blade, man.

09:50.753 --> 09:52.019
Straight up.

09:52.087 --> 09:53.788
I just hope she can find
the strength to--

09:55.758 --> 09:57.392
She's probably just telling him

09:57.459 --> 09:59.493
she's...dying to feel
the warmth of his...

09:59.560 --> 10:01.895
Are you kidding me?

10:01.962 --> 10:03.930
She said we were sisters.

10:03.998 --> 10:07.000
I am so sad right now.

10:07.067 --> 10:10.537
And she is so codependent!

10:10.605 --> 10:11.871
And such a bad speller.

10:17.477 --> 10:19.512
Nice shootin'.
Tough luck.

10:19.579 --> 10:22.315
Thanks.
I'll go another round.

10:22.382 --> 10:24.650
There's room in our bed
for three bears, right, honey?

10:24.718 --> 10:26.352
And then some, sugar.

10:26.420 --> 10:27.886
You're very nice...

10:27.954 --> 10:29.922
For a man named...
What'd you say it was? Blade?

10:29.989 --> 10:31.289
Yup.

10:31.357 --> 10:33.090
But that's a carnival name
though, right?

10:33.158 --> 10:35.360
A <i>nom de</i> corn dog?

10:35.428 --> 10:36.695
Why would I have
a carnival name?

10:36.762 --> 10:37.995
Your parents named you Blade?

10:38.063 --> 10:39.364
Apparently.

10:39.432 --> 10:41.966
Well, you seem okay with it.

10:42.034 --> 10:44.068
Not much to do about it.

10:44.136 --> 10:45.069
You could change it.

10:45.137 --> 10:48.372
To what?
Templeton Ferrari III?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.407
Won't change
how mustard tastes.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.710
I'll be right back.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.812
Huh. Won't change
how mustard tastes.

10:54.879 --> 10:56.913
I get it.
I see the appeal.

10:56.981 --> 10:58.749
He's relaxed, he's cool.

10:58.817 --> 11:02.418
N-not as cool as you.

11:02.486 --> 11:05.020
Mr. Blade.
I want three more rounds.

11:05.088 --> 11:06.255
Jeffrey!

11:06.323 --> 11:07.623
Not gonna change
the way mustard tastes.

11:07.691 --> 11:09.024
Oh, and you're so cool,
Shirley.

11:09.092 --> 11:10.693
Sometimes I am.

11:13.430 --> 11:14.897
How many times
are they gonna do that?

11:14.965 --> 11:16.566
Aw, this is it, isn't it?

11:16.633 --> 11:17.967
We're becoming best friends.

11:18.034 --> 11:21.570
I think so.
I think so.

11:21.637 --> 11:26.040
♪ Would you let me
be your best friend ♪

11:26.108 --> 11:29.511
♪ I would call you every day ♪

11:30.813 --> 11:35.015
Oh, my God!
One after the other!

11:35.083 --> 11:36.817
"I'm texting to tell you
I'm not texting you any more.

11:36.885 --> 11:39.219
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

11:39.287 --> 11:41.288
"Are you mad at me now?

11:41.356 --> 11:43.524
Fine. I guess you don't
wanna know our two-year-old."

11:43.592 --> 11:44.925
Can we please just put it

11:44.993 --> 11:46.193
under a stack of mattresses
or something?

11:46.261 --> 11:47.695
I don't know.
When is she gonna take a hint?

11:47.763 --> 11:49.830
Britta's attracted
to unavailable men.

11:49.898 --> 11:52.932
- Dean, why are you here?
- Ouch.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.968
Fine. Let's make him
available.

11:56.036 --> 11:57.970
- What are you doing?
- Ending this.

11:58.038 --> 12:01.007
- "Leave me alone."
- No!

12:01.074 --> 12:03.976
That's so much worse.

12:04.044 --> 12:06.078
See?
She stopped.

12:11.150 --> 12:12.551
She's calling him?

12:12.619 --> 12:13.985
She was born in the '80s.

12:14.053 --> 12:15.754
She still uses her phone
as a phone.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.188
- Uh-oh.
- That's fine, it's fine.

12:17.256 --> 12:20.292
- We just won't answer it.
- Won't it go to your voicemail?

12:21.861 --> 12:25.062
Hello? Blade?

12:31.870 --> 12:32.870
There you go.

12:32.938 --> 12:34.271
I don't know!

12:34.339 --> 12:36.574
Change your settings
so it doesn't go to voicemail.

12:36.642 --> 12:38.875
Too late.

12:38.943 --> 12:41.511
You guys act like a carnival.
<i>Be</i> a carnival.

12:41.579 --> 12:43.513
Now!

12:43.581 --> 12:45.482
- Step right up!
- Ding, ding, ding!

12:45.550 --> 12:46.950
Get your popcorn here.

12:47.017 --> 12:49.920
- Hello?
- Busy, babe.

12:49.987 --> 12:51.655
Blade, just wait.
Wait, Bla...

12:52.990 --> 12:56.058
I told you not to call me
at work!

12:56.125 --> 12:58.494
"I'm sorry, I forgot.

12:58.562 --> 13:00.429
Don't be mad at me."

13:00.497 --> 13:02.531
She's whipped
by an imaginary douche.

13:02.599 --> 13:05.367
Hey, don't knock it
till you try it.

13:05.435 --> 13:07.402
I got my fake
bachelor's degree,

13:07.471 --> 13:09.505
and then I cheated on the LSAT.

13:09.573 --> 13:11.506
You're probably wondering,
how do you cheat on the LSAT?

13:11.540 --> 13:12.774
How?

13:12.842 --> 13:14.241
A magician never reveals
his secrets, my friend.

13:14.309 --> 13:16.010
Ah.

13:19.114 --> 13:22.249
- Yeah! In your face!
- Good job.

13:22.317 --> 13:25.052
Uh, give me the big one!
Yeah, that's the one.

13:25.120 --> 13:27.287
Yeah.

13:27.355 --> 13:28.689
Not too shabby, huh?

13:28.756 --> 13:30.824
Yeah, you really did it,
baby.

13:30.892 --> 13:32.292
So you dropped
out of high school

13:32.360 --> 13:33.861
and joined the carnival.

13:33.928 --> 13:35.462
And 15 years later,
here you are.

13:35.530 --> 13:37.097
- Jeffrey!
- Guess that's about it.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.665
So what's the record?

13:38.733 --> 13:40.233
What's the best anyone's
ever done in this booth?

13:40.301 --> 13:42.969
- I guess eight ducks.
- All right, one more round.

13:43.036 --> 13:44.136
One more round.

13:44.204 --> 13:46.038
- Jeff?
- Honey?

13:46.106 --> 13:47.707
Will you excuse us
just for a moment, please?

13:47.774 --> 13:48.908
Certainly.

13:48.976 --> 13:51.043
Can you get over here?

13:53.380 --> 13:55.581
- What is your end game here?
- I don't know.

13:55.649 --> 13:57.249
- I wanna know.
- Wanna know what?

13:57.317 --> 13:59.217
I wanna know what drove Britta
crazy about him.

13:59.284 --> 14:01.753
Are you jealous?
Are you in love with Britta?

14:01.821 --> 14:03.054
No, I am not in love
with Britta.

14:03.122 --> 14:04.589
And yes, I'm insanely
jealous of him.

14:04.657 --> 14:06.057
What's his secret?

14:06.125 --> 14:07.959
Why do you wanna know the
secret to making a woman psycho?

14:08.027 --> 14:09.794
Why do we wanna know
how to blow up the earth

14:09.862 --> 14:11.763
or grow a human ear on a mouse?

14:11.831 --> 14:13.264
In case we have to, Shirley.

14:13.332 --> 14:14.598
In case we have to.

14:14.666 --> 14:17.568
- I'm going to find Pierce.
- Good!

14:17.636 --> 14:20.237
One of those bears is mine!

14:20.304 --> 14:22.772
So this is best friendship.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.206
Something else, isn't it?

14:24.274 --> 14:25.608
How do we keep it going?

14:25.676 --> 14:26.943
How do we know
we won't get into a fight?

14:27.011 --> 14:28.578
I say we just let it happen.

14:28.646 --> 14:30.880
Don't tell me what to do!

14:30.948 --> 14:32.215
- What's your problem?
- What's yours?

14:32.335 --> 14:33.844
I'm outta here!

Message.

15:10.550 --> 15:12.817
Okay. We can stop worrying
about voicemail now.

15:12.885 --> 15:14.386
Back to the matter at hand.

15:14.453 --> 15:15.920
Now what are you doing?

15:15.988 --> 15:18.288
- Dean, why are you here?
- Yikes.

15:18.356 --> 15:20.457
I figured it out.
I know exactly what to do.

15:20.525 --> 15:23.360
I'm just gonna be really,
really, really mean to her.

15:23.428 --> 15:24.594
Uh.

15:24.662 --> 15:25.962
What don't you get
about the concept?

15:26.031 --> 15:29.033
Britta likes guys
who are mean to her.

15:29.100 --> 15:31.201
She doesn't like herself.

15:31.269 --> 15:34.203
Give me the phone.

15:39.076 --> 15:40.843
What did you say?

15:40.911 --> 15:42.078
Something nice.

15:42.146 --> 15:44.180
Don't worry about it.

15:44.248 --> 15:48.584
I'm deleting it
from your phone.

15:48.652 --> 15:51.086
- Hi.
- What's up?

15:51.154 --> 15:53.588
You guys still watching movies?

15:56.092 --> 15:57.259
Hi, Dean.
Why are you here?

15:57.326 --> 15:59.661
Hi, Britta.
And ouch.

15:59.728 --> 16:01.329
And you don't know anything
about carpentry.

16:01.397 --> 16:02.730
- Nope.
- Or aquariums--

16:02.798 --> 16:04.399
freshwater or saltwater.

16:04.467 --> 16:06.367
- Do you have a big weiner?
- Nope.

16:06.435 --> 16:08.169
I don't get it, Blade!

16:08.236 --> 16:10.971
What's your secret?
Why do I wanna impress you?

16:11.039 --> 16:15.109
Are you dumb or smart?
Are you a loser or winner?

16:15.177 --> 16:16.743
Or are you just a human mirror?

16:16.811 --> 16:18.512
Do we all see
what we wanna see in you?

16:18.580 --> 16:21.549
A magician never reveals,
right?

16:23.016 --> 16:25.685
Right.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.488
Later.

16:28.556 --> 16:30.856
Okay.

16:30.924 --> 16:35.161
You dropped over 300 bucks
on my booth, so I'll tell ya.

16:35.229 --> 16:36.729
You wanna know my secret?

16:36.797 --> 16:40.199
Yes.

16:40.266 --> 16:43.535
Yes, I do.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.440
What are you doing?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.941
I wanna know.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.943
Okay, I'm sorry.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.645
I was texting with Blade,
but it's over now.

16:54.713 --> 16:58.583
He's...a loser.

17:00.719 --> 17:01.986
Good night.

17:02.053 --> 17:04.521
Uh, uh, uh...
Troy!

17:04.589 --> 17:05.990
You should really join

17:06.057 --> 17:07.790
the air conditioning
repair program.

17:07.858 --> 17:09.727
- No.
- Well, that didn't work.

17:09.794 --> 17:11.194
That's what I get
for improvising.

17:11.262 --> 17:14.196
Good night.

17:14.265 --> 17:15.698
So I don't get it.

17:15.766 --> 17:18.201
He's a vampire, but he can
walk around during the day?

17:18.269 --> 17:22.305
- What...is wrong with you?
- Huh?

17:22.373 --> 17:24.508
You weren't texting Blade,
you were texting us.

17:24.575 --> 17:26.474
I switched Blade's number
in your phone to mine.

17:26.542 --> 17:29.778
- You tricked me?
- You tricked me!

17:29.846 --> 17:32.047
You ask for my help,
you tell me I'm your sister,

17:32.115 --> 17:35.717
I do everything I can
to make you hate this turd,

17:35.785 --> 17:38.654
and the first nice thing
he says, and you're over him?

17:38.721 --> 17:41.257
Who are you?

17:41.324 --> 17:42.657
And why didn't it stick?

17:42.724 --> 17:46.694
I was texting with you guys
this whole time?

17:46.762 --> 17:50.365
So Blade...isn't a loser!

17:50.432 --> 17:51.832
Uh-oh.

17:51.900 --> 17:55.637
No, let her go.
Lost cause, man.

17:55.704 --> 17:57.605
Jeff!
What are you doing here?

17:57.673 --> 17:59.239
I just got back
from the carnival...

17:59.307 --> 18:00.374
Where I met Blade.

18:00.441 --> 18:01.508
Is he okay?
How is he?

18:01.576 --> 18:02.909
He's brain damaged.

18:02.977 --> 18:04.844
- Well, let's not be petty.
- No, I'm serious.

18:04.912 --> 18:06.146
He showed me the scar.

18:06.214 --> 18:08.315
Ten years ago,
before he even met you,

18:08.383 --> 18:10.784
a loose bolt flew off
a Ferris wheel

18:10.851 --> 18:12.286
and imbedded in his skull,

18:12.353 --> 18:17.190
destroying the part of his brain
that feels shame.

18:17.257 --> 18:20.693
He's basically irresistible
to people for the same reason

18:20.760 --> 18:24.129
he can pretty much only work
at a carnival.

18:24.198 --> 18:26.465
He has nothing to prove
or disprove

18:26.533 --> 18:29.168
about himself or to himself.

18:29.236 --> 18:30.502
He has no shame.

18:30.570 --> 18:32.204
Why wouldn't he
have told me that?

18:32.271 --> 18:33.971
Because he didn't care
if you knew.

18:34.039 --> 18:36.274
That is so like him.

18:36.342 --> 18:38.943
- I have to go to him.
- No, woman.

18:39.011 --> 18:42.146
None of us have to
"go to" anyone.

18:42.215 --> 18:43.682
And the idea we do
is a mental illness

18:43.749 --> 18:45.750
we contracted
from breath mint commercials

18:45.818 --> 18:47.117
and Sandra bullock.

18:47.185 --> 18:48.919
We can't keep going
to each other

18:48.986 --> 18:53.156
until we learn to go
to ourselves.

18:53.225 --> 18:56.827
Stop making our hatred
of ourselves someone else's job

18:56.894 --> 18:59.697
and just stop hating ourselves.

19:07.671 --> 19:10.106
Annie, I want you
to take my phone.

19:10.173 --> 19:11.907
Do not let me call Chang.

19:11.975 --> 19:15.745
I'm locking myself
in your room.

19:16.847 --> 19:18.380
What are you guys
doing out here?

19:18.448 --> 19:19.914
Self-actualizing.

19:19.982 --> 19:21.283
Well, it's loud.

19:21.351 --> 19:23.685
Come watch <i>Blade.</i>

19:23.753 --> 19:26.388
Okay.

19:58.986 --> 20:00.887
This movie is fantastic.

20:02.425 --> 20:11.969

20:14.582 --> 20:16.353
Y'all ever notice
that cold spot in the hallway?

20:16.473 --> 20:17.117
Oh, yeah!

20:17.185 --> 20:19.286
That thing is <i>freezing!</i>

20:19.353 --> 20:21.453
You know what could learn
a lesson from that cold spot?

20:21.521 --> 20:24.690
The air conditioning unit
in my living room.

20:24.758 --> 20:26.959
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:27.027 --> 20:28.261
so yesterday, typical Sunday.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.328
I was hanging out
in my dreamatorium.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.696
Whoo!

20:30.764 --> 20:32.331
This ever happen to you guys?

20:32.399 --> 20:34.033
I couldn't remember
where I imagined the door.

20:35.235 --> 20:38.303
Then I realized I was in
an actual bathroom.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.640
Uh, no offense,
but this material

20:42.708 --> 20:44.609
seems pretty specific
to your apartment.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.845
I don't think it'll work
at an open mic.

20:52.217 --> 20:53.350
Y'all ever notice
the difference

20:53.418 --> 20:55.619
between me and Troy
brushing our teeth?

20:55.687 --> 20:58.722
I brush my teeth like this.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.658
Troy brushes his teeth
like this.

21:02.994 --> 21:04.061
I do!

21:04.129 --> 21:06.263
I do! I brush my teeth
just like that.

21:06.331 --> 21:07.977
Now you know what I'm gonna
talk about next.

21:08.097 --> 21:09.590
Toaster oven!

21:09.710 --> 21:11.156
It's from his album.

21:12.305 --> 21:18.591
