00:01.183 --> 00:03.750
Welcome to "Everlasting".

00:05.052 --> 00:08.255
Something's wrong. It's Mary.
Somehow, she got on the roof.

00:08.257 --> 00:09.640
Give me your hand right now.

00:09.642 --> 00:11.008
Come with me.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.759
Mary! Wait!

00:13.512 --> 00:16.096
One of our cast members passed away.

00:16.097 --> 00:18.765
I'm gonna call legal.
We'll deal with the family.

00:18.767 --> 00:21.401
But I want to zip this thing
up air tight. You hear me?

00:21.403 --> 00:24.104
No lights, no camera, no action.

00:24.106 --> 00:26.907
- Whole season's been kind of freaky.
- It's my first one.

00:26.909 --> 00:28.525
Maybe we should postpone the wedding.

00:28.527 --> 00:31.127
- This is about Rachel.
- Maybe.

00:31.129 --> 00:33.196
There is just so much
that you don't see. It's...

00:33.198 --> 00:35.015
When it comes to you, I
see more than you think.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.455
Coming home?

00:41.457 --> 00:43.590
Yeah.

00:43.592 --> 00:45.792
I just left my wife.

00:57.139 --> 01:00.307
We were on the beach, stark
naked, and we were in...

01:00.309 --> 01:03.277
You know, we were in the
middle of... of doing it.

01:03.279 --> 01:05.812
And suddenly, there were lights everywhere,

01:05.814 --> 01:07.397
just shining down at us.

01:07.399 --> 01:09.483
It was the birding club.

01:09.485 --> 01:13.954
16 old ladies just staring us
down at 5:00 in the morning.

01:13.956 --> 01:17.040
The most embarrassing moment of my life.

01:18.327 --> 01:19.960
I don't even know how you would do that.

01:19.962 --> 01:22.296
I don't like having sex on
the beach with all that sand.

01:22.298 --> 01:24.331
Yeah, that's what beds are for.

01:25.601 --> 01:27.834
All right, easy, boy.

01:27.836 --> 01:30.220
You've got enough toys
around here to play with.

01:30.222 --> 01:31.972
I don't want the toys.

01:31.974 --> 01:35.726
Sometimes a man wants a
grown-up to look him in the eye.

01:36.628 --> 01:40.812
Yeah, and people in hell...
they want ice water. I got to go.

01:42.484 --> 01:46.101
His royal highness has you
wiping his ass awfully early.

01:46.188 --> 01:48.772
Yeah, he was, uh, just
borrowing my cellphone.

01:48.774 --> 01:50.274
I think he had to call his lawyer

01:50.276 --> 01:52.526
about the vineyard or
something. I have no idea.

01:52.528 --> 01:55.111
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:55.114 --> 01:57.864
But, um, look, we... we have a problem.

01:57.866 --> 01:59.449
- What? What happened?
- It's, um...

01:59.451 --> 02:02.869
I can't stop thinking
about the other night.

02:02.871 --> 02:05.706
Well, that... sucks for you.

02:05.708 --> 02:07.958
You should just tell your fiancée about it.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.176
Yeah, uh, look...

02:10.179 --> 02:11.595
You know what? It's...

02:11.597 --> 02:13.764
It... we didn't mean it,
okay? We were in shock.

02:13.766 --> 02:15.882
- Rachel? Control room.
- So it was just...

02:15.884 --> 02:17.551
- We got a big day.
- I'm flying in.

02:17.553 --> 02:19.186
I have to go. Quinn's freaking.

02:19.188 --> 02:20.638
- We're not done, now.
- I know.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.390
- We're talking later.
- Great.

02:28.113 --> 02:30.948
They say that every
cloud has a silver lining.

02:30.950 --> 02:34.568
And we here at "Everlasting"
believe that to be true.

02:34.570 --> 02:37.788
If the tragedy of Mary
Newhouse untimely death

02:37.790 --> 02:41.408
has taught us anything,
it's that life is fleeting...

02:41.410 --> 02:43.410
What the hell is he doing with an umbrella?

02:43.412 --> 02:44.745
It's not even raining.

02:44.747 --> 02:47.414
Cut! Cut!

Who wrote this crap? It's
just too much doom and gloom.

02:52.795 --> 02:55.644
It's my fault. I'll adjust
and give the note to Graham.

02:55.798 --> 02:58.098
Oh, hey, finally. All right, here we go.

02:58.100 --> 03:00.300
We are done with death, okay?

03:00.302 --> 03:02.803
Give me romance, romance, romance!

03:02.805 --> 03:04.805
Let's get this show back
to what it's all about.

03:04.807 --> 03:06.890
True love, baby!

03:09.612 --> 03:11.645
Thank you.

03:13.498 --> 03:15.699
All right, let's keep it
cool, guys. Let's keep it cool.

03:15.701 --> 03:16.950
It's kind of disgusting.

03:16.952 --> 03:18.652
- Fine. Thank you.
- Okay, okay.

03:18.654 --> 03:20.988
This week, it is spa dates, all right?

03:20.990 --> 03:22.573
We've got four girls left...

03:22.575 --> 03:24.942
Anna, Faith, Grace, and Shamiqua.

03:25.044 --> 03:26.827
Let's heat things up.
Let's keep America guessing.

03:26.829 --> 03:29.663
Come on, nobody is guessing.
That boy is going for Grace.

03:29.665 --> 03:30.914
- You don't know that for sure.
- Honey...

03:30.916 --> 03:32.916
- No, you don't...
- I may be gay, but I know

03:32.918 --> 03:34.835
what kind of punani
straight boys like, okay?

03:34.837 --> 03:37.254
I'm with homeboy. Grace
has the lips and the body,

03:37.256 --> 03:38.922
and she can count to 10... I think.

03:38.924 --> 03:40.674
That one's not even important, 10.

03:40.676 --> 03:44.575
Anna's a total catch. She's beautiful,
she graduated magna cum laude

03:44.597 --> 03:46.647
from, like, brown or something.

03:46.649 --> 03:48.682
And Adam is not as shallow as you think.

03:48.684 --> 03:50.067
He's just not.

03:50.069 --> 03:51.735
According to nobody but you.

03:51.737 --> 03:53.404
All right, let's just forget
who the front-runner is.

03:53.406 --> 03:54.571
I need a horse race.

03:54.573 --> 03:56.523
So, Jay, we need to amp up Shamiqua.

03:56.525 --> 03:59.059
I want less brains and
I want more cleavage.

03:59.061 --> 04:00.494
- You got it.
- Okay?

04:00.496 --> 04:02.196
And, Rachel, I don't know
what to do with Faith,

04:02.198 --> 04:04.114
but we've got to make her hot for Adam.

04:04.116 --> 04:06.750
And Anna... Anna's got to loosen up.

04:06.752 --> 04:08.535
Come on. Have some fun.

04:08.537 --> 04:10.370
Show some skin, you know?

04:10.372 --> 04:13.974
Adam wants a lady on the street
but a freak in the sheets.

04:13.976 --> 04:16.009
Capiche? Right?

04:16.313 --> 04:18.930
We got three more episodes
to get him to propose

04:18.932 --> 04:20.814
to one of these ding-dongs.

04:21.016 --> 04:23.050
Excuse me, Mr. Wilton. I'm so sorry.

04:23.052 --> 04:24.768
- Your wife is here.
- Ex-wife.

04:24.770 --> 04:26.353
Not soon enough.

04:26.355 --> 04:28.472
We need to talk.

04:28.474 --> 04:30.441
Uh, you guys can use my office.

04:30.443 --> 04:34.228
My, that's so generous of you, Quinn.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.398
I talked to my lawyer.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.617
- Bully for you.
- "Bully" is right.

04:40.619 --> 04:43.821
You can have your divorce, Chet.

04:43.823 --> 04:47.374
But I am gonna take you
for every penny you have.

04:47.376 --> 04:49.209
By the time I'm done with you,

04:49.211 --> 04:52.212
you are gonna be living in a
single in the city of commerce.

04:52.214 --> 04:53.580
Well, cali's a community-property state.

04:53.582 --> 04:55.048
You'll get your half. What are you doing?

04:55.050 --> 04:57.184
You can't drink. You're pregnant.

04:57.186 --> 05:00.137
Oh, please. At my age, 50/50,
it's a flipper baby anyways.

05:00.139 --> 05:02.840
And yeah, I will get my half.

05:02.842 --> 05:06.009
But this little sideshow attraction

05:06.011 --> 05:07.594
gonna get everything else.

05:07.596 --> 05:10.347
Child support's gonna
take you to the cleaners.

05:10.349 --> 05:12.850
I'd think about downsizing if I were you.

05:12.852 --> 05:14.151
Look, my lawyers

05:14.153 --> 05:15.853
are gonna fight you every step of the way,

05:15.855 --> 05:17.855
and your lawyers are
gonna fight my lawyers.

05:17.857 --> 05:19.606
Mm, let the games begin.

05:19.608 --> 05:21.825
And we're both gonna be paying
those lawyers millions...

05:21.827 --> 05:23.610
Millions we both lose.

05:23.612 --> 05:25.579
Or...

05:25.581 --> 05:26.997
Or?

05:26.999 --> 05:29.449
We cut a deal, right here, right now.

05:29.451 --> 05:31.585
Leave the lawyers out of it.

05:31.587 --> 05:35.122
I'm listening.

05:35.124 --> 05:36.874
Thanks so much. I appreciate it.

05:36.876 --> 05:38.125
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

05:38.127 --> 05:39.793
Hi. Here's to a good night.

05:39.795 --> 05:42.095
Yes, and very little sleep.

05:42.097 --> 05:43.463
When you do sleep...

05:43.465 --> 05:44.965
You're very active. Do you know that?

05:44.967 --> 05:47.467
You drool and you snore a lot. Just...

05:47.469 --> 05:49.770
Lucky you. Lucky you.

05:49.772 --> 05:51.855
Um, so, look... today, I, um...

05:51.857 --> 05:54.641
I'm gonna need you to bring your "A" game.

05:54.643 --> 05:56.026
- My "A" game?
- Yes, please.

05:56.028 --> 05:57.644
- Three days after a woman died.
- I know.

05:57.646 --> 05:59.146
It's super weird, but you know Quinn.

05:59.148 --> 06:01.281
She's doesn't like to linger
on feelings or anything.

06:01.283 --> 06:03.233
How about you?

06:03.235 --> 06:04.985
Lingering?

06:04.987 --> 06:07.070
My specialty.

06:07.072 --> 06:08.822
- Got it.
- Yeah.

06:08.824 --> 06:10.725
You know, she wants a little
romance to cleanse the palate.

06:10.727 --> 06:12.760
- Oh, I can do that.
- Not me, Romeo. Them.

06:13.462 --> 06:14.995
Get on out there.

06:21.935 --> 06:23.170
You all feel weird about this?

06:23.172 --> 06:24.888
What? The show?

06:24.890 --> 06:26.723
Yeah. I mean...

06:26.725 --> 06:28.175
Mary and all?

06:28.177 --> 06:30.727
And we're just... Here,
goofing off, having a good time?

06:30.729 --> 06:33.480
Yeah, it's hard, but
what's quitting the show

06:33.482 --> 06:36.099
or curling up in a ball
gonna do for anyone?

06:36.101 --> 06:37.851
If I had stayed home after my dad died,

06:37.853 --> 06:40.153
I would be eating my feelings

06:40.155 --> 06:42.856
and crying myself to sleep at night.

06:42.858 --> 06:44.858
At least on the show, I'm
doing something.

06:44.860 --> 06:46.693
I'm staying busy.

06:46.695 --> 06:51.112
I mean, do you really think that
Mary would've wanted us to quit?

06:51.200 --> 06:53.166
Ladies...

06:53.168 --> 06:54.534
May I?

06:54.536 --> 06:58.121
As a veteran of this series,
there's a little saying

06:58.123 --> 07:01.875
we have in showbiz...
"the show must go on."

07:01.877 --> 07:04.211
And in the case of your
quest for Everlasting love,

07:04.213 --> 07:08.715
the search must go on.

07:08.717 --> 07:11.885
After 13 seasons, that's all you got?

07:11.887 --> 07:14.271
Well, that and an Emmy.

07:19.561 --> 07:21.445
Yes! Hoo!

07:24.950 --> 07:26.566
Oh. $50 million?

07:26.568 --> 07:28.819
What were you thinking?

07:28.821 --> 07:30.153
Come on.

07:30.155 --> 07:32.539
I thought we weren't gonna
talk about that anymore.

07:32.541 --> 07:33.824
Oh, come on.

07:33.826 --> 07:36.410
I mean, I worked really
hard for that money, too.

07:36.412 --> 07:37.911
And what did she do?

07:37.913 --> 07:40.614
She shopped at whole foods and lululemon?

07:40.716 --> 07:42.833
I-I don't like it any more than you do,

07:42.835 --> 07:45.669
but at least it clears
the way for you and me.

07:45.671 --> 07:47.471
Yeah, I guess.

07:47.473 --> 07:49.256
It's actually sort of sweet,

07:49.258 --> 07:51.925
you giving away 50 mil for little, old me.

07:51.927 --> 07:54.061
And you are worth every cent.

07:54.063 --> 07:56.347
Oh, we'll make that cash back in no time.

07:56.349 --> 07:58.515
All we have to do is
start selling some shows.

07:58.817 --> 08:00.150
And...

08:00.152 --> 08:02.102
Oh, speak of the devil.

08:02.104 --> 08:03.737
- There's Brad.
- And the best part?

08:03.739 --> 08:05.188
The wicked witch of brentwood.

08:05.190 --> 08:07.774
won't be able to touch a
cent we make from here on in.

08:07.776 --> 08:10.160
All right, hold on. Hoo!

08:10.162 --> 08:13.330
All right, here we go.

08:13.332 --> 08:14.614
Hey, guys.

08:14.616 --> 08:16.366
- Hey!
- Hi!

08:16.368 --> 08:18.285
How's everyone holding up?

08:19.172 --> 08:20.955
You know, it's... it's been a little tough,

08:21.457 --> 08:23.256
but we're getting through it.

08:23.258 --> 08:24.791
I... I feel terrible.

08:24.793 --> 08:27.961
But how about those
monster numbers last night?

08:27.963 --> 08:29.346
Right?

08:29.348 --> 08:32.799
Yeah, 6.8... up 22% from last week.

08:32.801 --> 08:34.051
Whoo!

08:34.053 --> 08:35.769
Yeah, people should die more often.

08:35.770 --> 08:37.471
I know! Unbelievable!

08:37.472 --> 08:39.972
How's, uh, how's her kid doing?

08:39.975 --> 08:41.357
Fine, I think.

08:41.360 --> 08:45.562
Management is thrilled with these numbers.

08:45.564 --> 08:48.148
They want to capitalize on
the momentum, so get this.

08:48.150 --> 08:50.701
They want to end the season with Cromwell

08:50.703 --> 08:54.321
marrying one of these chicks, live, on air.

08:54.323 --> 08:55.655
So we're talking about

08:55.657 --> 08:58.375
a two-hour special "Everlasting" wedding.

08:58.377 --> 09:00.660
I mean, is that not genius?

09:00.662 --> 09:02.579
Can you guys make that happen?

09:02.581 --> 09:04.214
What if we take it one step further

09:04.216 --> 09:07.000
and use the wedding to backdoor
a spin-off for next season?

09:07.002 --> 09:08.385
Right.

09:08.387 --> 09:10.504
And... and, uh, we have
Adam and his new bride,

09:10.506 --> 09:13.507
um, adjusting to the
upper-crust life in the UK.

09:13.509 --> 09:15.008
- We'll call it "Royal Love".
- Oh.

09:15.010 --> 09:16.393
Sweet! I'll tell you what.

09:16.395 --> 09:18.428
You get him to marry
the Mexican bikini model,

09:18.430 --> 09:20.397
and you've got yourselves
a deal, all right?

09:20.399 --> 09:22.265
She'll bring in the telemundo audience.

09:22.267 --> 09:23.850
Okay.

09:23.852 --> 09:24.985
Bye! Boom!

09:24.987 --> 09:27.571
That's what I'm talking about. Synergy.

09:27.573 --> 09:29.990
You and me. Oh, man.

09:29.992 --> 09:32.192
We're gonna double that 50 mil in no time.

09:33.445 --> 09:34.861
I love you.

09:34.863 --> 09:37.414
Oh, I love you, too.

09:43.622 --> 09:45.372
Wait. So, I don't get it.

09:45.374 --> 09:47.874
Are you saying that I've already won?

09:47.876 --> 09:49.459
Isn't that great? What do you say?

09:49.461 --> 09:51.044
Shouldn't be so hard to be married

09:51.046 --> 09:53.013
to such a beautiful,
exotic, and compelling woman.

09:53.015 --> 09:55.599
I mean, that's... that's
quite a proposition.

09:55.601 --> 09:58.385
Um, so, on this show...

09:58.387 --> 10:00.470
- "Royal Love".
- Ooh.

10:00.472 --> 10:01.772
I love how that sounds.

10:01.774 --> 10:03.723
So, uh, Grace and I...
we're gonna be married?

10:03.725 --> 10:05.142
No. You'll be married on "Everlasting."

10:05.144 --> 10:06.860
You'll propose in the final episode,

10:06.862 --> 10:08.562
and then we'll do a two-hour special

10:08.564 --> 10:10.263
when we introduce the spin-off.

10:10.365 --> 10:13.233
A spin-off. So exciting.

10:13.235 --> 10:15.452
Yeah, indeed.

10:15.454 --> 10:17.154
So glad you two are on board.

10:17.156 --> 10:19.656
Quinn, we're ready for Grace now.

10:19.658 --> 10:22.075
Okay. Copy that. I'm sending her down.

10:22.077 --> 10:23.910
All right. So, just
keep this under your hat.

10:23.912 --> 10:25.662
The only reason why we're telling you this

10:25.664 --> 10:27.464
is 'cause we need you two to sign releases.

10:27.466 --> 10:29.049
Thing's moving at warp speed.

10:29.051 --> 10:30.750
- Consider me signed.
- All right.

10:30.752 --> 10:32.385
We'll draw up the paperwork.

10:32.387 --> 10:33.587
Thank you. Thanks.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.005
Uh, Quinn, uh...

10:35.007 --> 10:37.724
Before you do that...

10:37.726 --> 10:39.726
You okay, Chief?

10:39.728 --> 10:41.094
Yeah, look. Uh...

10:41.096 --> 10:43.814
don't get me wrong, Grace is a lovely girl,

10:43.816 --> 10:45.732
but what you're suggesting is absurd.

10:45.734 --> 10:47.567
I signed on for one season of this.

10:47.569 --> 10:49.769
One season, that's it.

10:49.771 --> 10:51.488
And look, I don't intend
to stick around for another,

10:51.490 --> 10:54.274
so, I mean, find yourself another patsy.

11:00.077 --> 11:03.578
"What a lovely house
you have, your lordship.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.214
Thank you so much for having me.

11:06.216 --> 11:08.084
Mm. So nice to be here.

11:08.277 --> 11:09.860
It's a pleasure to meet you.

11:09.863 --> 11:14.532
My name is Grace... Grace Cromwell."

11:17.620 --> 11:20.288
Practicing your accent, huh?

11:21.090 --> 11:23.841
Your mascara's smudged.

11:23.843 --> 11:27.512
Do you really think he's gonna pick you?

11:27.514 --> 11:29.013
Sluts get cut...

11:30.216 --> 11:32.183
Or that's what I hear.

11:32.485 --> 11:36.354
Honey, I know he's gonna pick me.

11:36.356 --> 11:38.856
It's all worked out.

11:38.858 --> 11:41.692
What is that supposed to mean?

11:41.694 --> 11:44.062
The pressure is on, ladies.

11:44.064 --> 11:49.033
Now, since Maya sadly decided
to, of course, leave the show,

11:49.035 --> 11:51.486
each of you have made it to the final four.

11:51.488 --> 11:53.905
We know it has been stressful for all of us

11:53.907 --> 11:57.542
these past few weeks, which is why we're
giving you a chance to relax with Adam

11:57.544 --> 12:02.528
- and rejuvenate at a tranquil zen paradise
- Anna. Anna, hi. Smile, okay?

12:02.714 --> 12:03.714
Behind me are candles.

12:03.716 --> 12:06.634
Each one of these candles is
a symbol of your burning desire

12:06.636 --> 12:08.302
to win Adam's heart.

12:08.304 --> 12:09.587
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:09.589 --> 12:11.172
Everything hunky-dory?

12:11.174 --> 12:13.307
- Yeah, hunkiest-doriest.
- You got a sec?

12:13.309 --> 12:16.260
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

12:16.262 --> 12:18.262
Okay. Now's good for me.

12:19.064 --> 12:21.599
Okay, cut. Everybody take five, please.

12:30.690 --> 12:32.823
Hey, psst. Shamiqua, come here.

12:32.825 --> 12:35.409
So, you're with me on this, right? Really?

12:35.411 --> 12:38.362
This is what it's come to
after hanging in there for weeks

12:38.364 --> 12:41.115
through a suicide? Now
it's "flash them titties"?

12:41.117 --> 12:42.416
Come on, girl.

12:42.418 --> 12:44.335
Seriously, you've got to
give me something.

12:44.337 --> 12:45.536
Or what?

12:45.538 --> 12:47.538
Or we both go home.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.373
You're my last girl.

12:52.727 --> 12:54.611
Well, what makes you think
I can even turn Adam around?

12:54.668 --> 12:56.201
Hey, he didn't want to do this show.

12:56.202 --> 12:58.751
- You're our limey whisperer.
- Okay, listen. That was then.

12:58.788 --> 13:01.173
We weren't asking him to sign
on and marry one of these girls.

13:01.175 --> 13:03.225
Come on. We're talking about a year here.

13:03.227 --> 13:05.060
Then they get a big, juicy divorce,

13:05.062 --> 13:06.761
splash it all over the tabloids.

13:06.763 --> 13:08.647
Screw all the D-listers they want.

13:09.633 --> 13:10.882
All right, okay.

13:10.884 --> 13:12.667
So let's say that I, uh...

13:12.669 --> 13:14.669
Let's say that I can, right?

13:14.671 --> 13:15.821
Let's say I can turn him around.

13:15.923 --> 13:17.873
- What's in it for me?
- Wheeling and dealing?

13:17.875 --> 13:19.458
Oh, mama bear taught you well.

13:19.460 --> 13:21.410
I'm just saying, you
are getting a spin-off.

13:22.012 --> 13:24.345
He's getting another year
to promote his vineyard.

13:24.347 --> 13:26.481
All right, all right,
fine. What do you want?

13:26.483 --> 13:29.017
Peace in the middle east.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.320
A sailboat full of ponies?

13:32.322 --> 13:35.523
Regular, miniature ponies? Continue. Or?

13:36.776 --> 13:38.526
My own show.

13:38.528 --> 13:41.496
Okay. Take "Royal Love".

13:41.498 --> 13:44.866
No. Just flat-out no.

13:44.868 --> 13:47.035
I'm not gonna get in between you and Quinn.

13:47.037 --> 13:48.419
Oh, Quinn's with me now.

13:48.421 --> 13:50.672
No, she's done her time in the trenches.

13:50.674 --> 13:52.674
It's your turn to not have a life.

13:52.676 --> 13:54.375
Come on. What do you say?

13:54.377 --> 13:57.128
Grunt to executive
producer, blink of an eye.

13:57.130 --> 13:58.930
It's a deal of a lifetime.

13:58.932 --> 14:02.383
All I have to do is deliver Adam?

14:02.385 --> 14:05.220
Well, on a silver platter.

14:05.222 --> 14:07.021
Of course.

14:07.023 --> 14:08.523
Oh. Hey, Adam!

14:08.525 --> 14:10.775
Adam, can I talk to you for a second?

14:10.777 --> 14:14.445
Hey. I, uh, wanted to talk to you.

14:14.447 --> 14:15.780
Let me guess.

14:15.782 --> 14:17.482
About "Royal Love",
this ludicrous spin-off

14:17.484 --> 14:19.400
Chet and Quinn are trying to rope me into?

14:19.402 --> 14:20.702
Just heard about it, yeah.

14:20.704 --> 14:21.903
These people are mad. I...

14:21.905 --> 14:24.155
A marriage was never part of the deal.

14:24.157 --> 14:26.124
Honestly, it's only for a year.

14:26.126 --> 14:28.293
Yeah, we'll just... We'll just
get married and just fake it.

14:28.295 --> 14:29.711
Of course. Brilliant.

14:29.713 --> 14:31.663
I would never do that
to one of these girls.

14:31.665 --> 14:34.082
Believe it or not, I actually
have a modicum of respect for them.

14:34.084 --> 14:36.634
Oh, I can't wait to get
the hell out of here.

14:36.636 --> 14:38.086
Yeah. Copy that, buddy.

14:38.088 --> 14:40.088
It's only three more weeks, right?

14:40.090 --> 14:42.090
Trust me, I'm counting the days.

14:45.428 --> 14:46.862
A.D.s, go to two.

14:46.864 --> 14:48.397
Copy that.

14:52.068 --> 14:55.236
"Royal Love"? Really?

14:55.238 --> 14:56.487
Who told you?

14:56.489 --> 14:59.774
A little bird with a great
ass and a deep throat.

14:59.776 --> 15:02.110
Grace is such an idiot.

15:02.112 --> 15:05.530
Yeah, which is why I should
be the one who wins this.

15:05.532 --> 15:07.749
What? Look, I don't even know

15:07.751 --> 15:09.917
why they went to her in the first place.

15:09.919 --> 15:11.586
Yeah, they hook up or whatever,

15:11.588 --> 15:14.205
but Adam came to my father's
funeral for a reason.

15:14.207 --> 15:16.874
Okay? We have a real connection.

15:16.876 --> 15:19.961
I think that you would...
You would be great.

15:19.963 --> 15:23.298
You would be so much
better than Grace for Adam.

15:23.300 --> 15:26.134
I mean, if it were up to me, it would...

15:26.136 --> 15:28.303
It would definitely be you.

15:28.305 --> 15:30.188
But?

15:30.190 --> 15:32.140
Do you really want it?

15:32.142 --> 15:35.026
'Cause I can work it on my end.

15:35.028 --> 15:38.446
But you're just gonna have
to work it with Adam, okay?

15:38.448 --> 15:42.200
You make him want you and
then get him on board with it.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.735
Well, what about Grace?

15:43.737 --> 15:45.036
I'll just...

15:45.038 --> 15:46.788
You focus on your future husband, okay?

15:46.790 --> 15:48.156
I'll take care of it.

15:49.993 --> 15:51.909
So, what's up? We have a deal?

15:51.911 --> 15:54.295
Yeah. Deal.

15:54.297 --> 15:55.997
I like you.

15:58.871 --> 16:01.740
So, each of our contestants
gets a chance to experience

16:01.742 --> 16:04.409
an individual spa treatment with Adam.

16:04.411 --> 16:06.795
Let's see how it's going, shall we?

16:06.797 --> 16:08.163
Whoa-ho-ho!

16:08.165 --> 16:10.815
Great idea, showing a little more skin.

16:10.817 --> 16:12.250
Ratings aren't the only thing
that're gonna be going up.

16:12.252 --> 16:15.303
- Soft-tissue massage.
- Right.

16:15.305 --> 16:17.172
Soft tissue.

16:17.174 --> 16:18.423
Right.

16:18.425 --> 16:19.925
Whoa.

16:19.927 --> 16:22.678
Ah. Just start with my back first, mister.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.479
We'll see how far you get.

16:24.481 --> 16:27.099
Beautiful, black boner killer.

16:28.769 --> 16:32.354
Medicinal mud has been used for
centuries as a healing regimen.

16:32.356 --> 16:35.273
So you want us to rub this
dirt all over ourselves?

16:35.275 --> 16:41.880
The mud opens the pores to
relax and invigorate the body.

16:41.882 --> 16:46.001
All right.

16:51.508 --> 16:53.625
Mm. Sexy.

16:55.379 --> 16:58.096
Check him out.

16:58.098 --> 17:00.132
Okay.

17:02.870 --> 17:04.803
Do you feel invigorated?

17:04.805 --> 17:06.438
Really? That's what you're gonna do?

17:06.440 --> 17:09.307
Oh. Mm. No.

17:11.678 --> 17:12.861
You like that?!

17:12.863 --> 17:15.063
Oh! Who's invigorated now?!

17:15.065 --> 17:16.982
Oh, I feel so alive!

17:18.117 --> 17:19.534
Oh, no. No!

17:21.320 --> 17:22.554
Yeah! You like it?!

17:22.556 --> 17:24.539
You like that?! Yeah!

17:26.492 --> 17:27.826
Cut, please, cut.

17:27.828 --> 17:29.828
The cedar enzyme bath

17:29.830 --> 17:33.381
boosts circulation and metabolism.

17:33.383 --> 17:36.835
It's both relaxing and energizing.

17:36.837 --> 17:38.837
Seems... Interesting.

17:38.839 --> 17:40.272
So, wait.

17:40.274 --> 17:42.340
We're just... we're gonna,
like, lay on top of it?

17:42.342 --> 17:43.558
Oh, no.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.310
You'll be immersed.

17:45.312 --> 17:47.229
Oh, my God.

17:48.682 --> 17:52.067
Okay.

17:58.242 --> 17:59.991
The warmth you feel is produced

17:59.993 --> 18:03.995
by a biological fermentation process.

18:03.997 --> 18:05.697
This feels good.

18:05.699 --> 18:08.533
I can't...

18:10.204 --> 18:11.870
Grace, are you okay?

18:11.872 --> 18:14.122
I can't just sit here.

18:14.124 --> 18:16.675
I... are you okay?

18:16.677 --> 18:18.210
That's not good.

18:18.212 --> 18:19.461
No! Aah!

18:19.463 --> 18:21.046
I can't! I'm not doing this!

18:21.048 --> 18:22.380
No, no, no!

18:22.382 --> 18:23.799
Cut! Cut, cut, cut!

18:23.801 --> 18:25.467
Grace?! Grace? You okay?

18:25.669 --> 18:28.887
I'm sorry. I'm claustrophobic, okay?

18:28.889 --> 18:30.555
Ever since I was a little girl.

18:30.557 --> 18:33.358
Where I come from, being
buried alive is no joke.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.093
- I can't.
- I'm sorry.

18:35.095 --> 18:36.812
You didn't know that
she was claustrophobic?

18:36.814 --> 18:39.530
If I did do you think I would've done
that? Do you want me to go talk to her?

18:39.532 --> 18:40.748
No, I'll handle it.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.400
You just start setting
up for the next date.

18:42.402 --> 18:46.321
Maybe that could be good,
you know, emotion-wise.

18:46.323 --> 18:49.106
You know, Adam consoles phobic chick?

18:49.108 --> 18:50.541
Oh, yeah, more consoling. That's hot.

18:50.543 --> 18:51.409
I just... I don't even know

18:51.411 --> 18:53.829
that he's gonna go for
somebody so high-strung.

18:53.831 --> 18:56.597
Brad wants Grace.
I don't give a crap.

18:56.599 --> 18:57.432
I just want a show.

18:57.434 --> 18:59.718
Okay, well, then we'll
just sell Anna to Brad.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.553
I mean, she's so much classier.

19:01.555 --> 19:03.421
Hold your horses, Tonto.

19:03.423 --> 19:06.925
Let's see how the date
goes first, all right?

19:09.930 --> 19:11.479
Hey.

19:11.481 --> 19:17.234
Um, locations gave me a bunch
of brochures of places we can go,

19:17.336 --> 19:19.520
you know, for the wedding?

19:19.522 --> 19:22.122
I thought that, you know, we
were talking about seeing...

19:22.142 --> 19:24.775
I know. Look, after...

19:24.777 --> 19:27.946
Everything that happened
with Mary, it just...

19:27.948 --> 19:31.283
It really put everything in perspective.

19:31.285 --> 19:34.119
I want to make things better, Jer.

19:34.121 --> 19:36.671
Okay, guys, moving on. Next setup.

19:36.673 --> 19:37.873
Got it!

19:37.875 --> 19:39.958
We need to talk about this later.

19:42.629 --> 19:46.431
Tantra is about accessing our energies

19:46.433 --> 19:49.467
to enhance pleasure and dissolve the ego.

19:54.274 --> 19:57.108
Oh. This is really good.

19:57.110 --> 20:01.947
With practice, partners
can make love for hours

20:01.949 --> 20:04.733
and have orgasms without touching...

20:05.380 --> 20:06.579
Damn.

20:06.582 --> 20:08.982
This bitch looks like
she could eat him alive.

20:08.988 --> 20:10.454
Well, look who's a little minx.

20:10.456 --> 20:12.489
- I'd totally do her.
- Mm-hmm.

20:12.491 --> 20:13.741
Yeah, if she gives us heat, so would I.

20:14.911 --> 20:20.381
Breathe them in. Feel them.

20:22.168 --> 20:23.834
Sorry, guys.

20:23.836 --> 20:26.370
- Sound needs us to hold for a plane.
- Holding.

20:29.392 --> 20:31.976
You know, this is actually kind of fun.

20:31.978 --> 20:33.928
Breathing each other in?

20:33.930 --> 20:36.063
Well, I... I don't know about you,

20:36.065 --> 20:39.400
but I personally prefer
physical touch when I orgasm.

20:39.402 --> 20:41.185
Are you making a pass at me?

20:42.405 --> 20:44.905
Do you want me to?

20:44.907 --> 20:47.224
Naughty girl.

20:47.226 --> 20:51.862
With the right person, you have no idea.

20:51.864 --> 20:54.282
Oh-ho-ho! Finally,
some friggin' chemistry.

20:54.284 --> 20:56.500
Yeah. No kidding. It's great.

20:56.502 --> 20:59.120
Yeah, no, I need to do some
yoga, 'cause this is just...

21:00.373 --> 21:03.007
Is there a lot of yoga in England?

21:03.009 --> 21:04.709
Don't know.

21:04.711 --> 21:06.794
More a polo guy.

21:06.796 --> 21:10.431
Well, I'm sure that we
could find some creative way

21:10.433 --> 21:12.383
to release our energies.

21:12.385 --> 21:13.601
What?

21:13.603 --> 21:15.386
Yeah, you know, just, in England,

21:15.388 --> 21:17.221
we could find something...

21:17.223 --> 21:19.523
You and me in England?

21:21.060 --> 21:24.061
So now they want you to
go to England with me?

21:24.063 --> 21:25.563
- No.
- Of course they do.

21:25.565 --> 21:28.231
Yep. Adam...

21:28.233 --> 21:29.817
These people are vulgar.

21:29.819 --> 21:34.238
They will do anything they can
to make a quick buck off us.

21:34.240 --> 21:35.956
And you'd willingly be a part of that?

21:35.958 --> 21:37.958
I... I'm sorry. I... I didn't...

21:37.960 --> 21:39.794
I mean, I got excited.

21:39.796 --> 21:41.212
What are you doing?

21:41.214 --> 21:42.747
- We're still shooting.
- Forget it.

21:42.749 --> 21:44.799
This date's over.

21:48.216 --> 21:49.800
Adam. Hey, hey, hey.

21:49.803 --> 21:51.052
Come on. Where are you going?

21:51.054 --> 21:52.838
To get a drink. It's ridiculous.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.340
"Royal Love"... Like
I'm so bendy child's toy

21:55.342 --> 21:57.175
they can twist however they like...

21:57.177 --> 22:00.178
Listen, I think it's a good
idea, for what it's worth.

22:00.180 --> 22:02.264
You are literally insane if you think

22:02.266 --> 22:05.400
I'm gonna marry a girl I met
three weeks ago on a TV show.

22:05.402 --> 22:07.452
It doesn't matter how fantastic she is.

22:07.454 --> 22:10.371
My God, they're both willing
to sign on the dotted line,

22:10.373 --> 22:11.039
- aren't they?
- Yeah, totally.

22:11.041 --> 22:12.491
What would drive a woman to do that?

22:12.493 --> 22:15.159
Oh, God. Every single fairy tale she's read

22:15.196 --> 22:16.862
since she was about I
would say 3 years old.

22:16.864 --> 22:19.365
- Wine?
- Yes, yes, thank you so much.

22:19.367 --> 22:20.699
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

22:20.879 --> 22:22.596
I am just telling you to think about it.

22:22.597 --> 22:24.713
You would be getting everything you wanted

22:24.715 --> 22:27.550
when you signed on for the
show, all of that exposure.

22:27.552 --> 22:29.385
So many people have taken that...

22:29.387 --> 22:31.604
That reality-show TV moment

22:31.606 --> 22:33.689
and turned it into something legit.

22:33.691 --> 22:34.807
I'm sorry.

22:34.809 --> 22:36.358
Is the real Rachel anywhere nearby?

22:36.360 --> 22:38.227
'Cause I don't recognize
this golem in front of me.

22:39.897 --> 22:41.447
- Oh.
- What?

22:41.449 --> 22:42.648
I get it.

22:42.650 --> 22:44.733
What are you getting out of this?

22:47.038 --> 22:48.621
I would be the showrunner.

22:48.623 --> 22:49.905
Of course.

22:49.907 --> 22:53.207
It's everything I wanted my entire career.

22:53.294 --> 22:55.244
Well, since when? Last night, you
were talking about writing novels

22:55.246 --> 22:56.712
and saving African AIDS babies.

22:56.714 --> 22:58.964
Those are just my dreams.
This is my actual life.

22:58.966 --> 23:00.466
So you're using me.

23:00.468 --> 23:01.967
Yeah, I am.

23:01.969 --> 23:03.419
- When I get used...
- Mm-hmm.

23:03.421 --> 23:04.887
I like to get paid a lot.

23:04.889 --> 23:06.639
This deal's not cutting it for me.

23:06.641 --> 23:08.724
Another year on a reality TV show,

23:08.726 --> 23:10.593
dancing for the organ grinder?

23:10.595 --> 23:12.978
No way. Besides, you know as well as I do

23:12.980 --> 23:15.781
I did this so I could
get away from my family.

23:15.783 --> 23:19.201
I do this insipid "Royal
Love", I'm back where I started,

23:19.203 --> 23:20.820
only with more for them
to ridicule me with.

23:20.822 --> 23:23.155
Listen, I'm just telling
you to think about it.

23:23.157 --> 23:26.108
The marriage wouldn't be real.
You could have it annulled.

23:26.110 --> 23:27.443
It would be real.

23:27.445 --> 23:29.278
This may shock you, Rachel,

23:29.280 --> 23:32.114
but marriage actually
means something to me.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.800
What the hell is this?

23:47.802 --> 23:50.803
No, Rachel, Jay, why
is the mansion prepped?

23:50.805 --> 23:52.555
The elimination ceremony is tomorrow.

23:52.557 --> 23:54.424
Damn it! Answer! All right?

23:54.468 --> 23:56.001
Come on. This is all wrong.

23:56.003 --> 24:00.506
Or... maybe it's just right.

24:04.228 --> 24:08.013
Shall we check it out?

24:08.015 --> 24:09.348
What?

24:10.985 --> 24:13.152
Mmm. Oh, my God.

24:13.154 --> 24:14.436
What is this?

24:14.438 --> 24:17.106
Cuisse de grenouilles sur un bâton.

24:17.108 --> 24:19.525
Frog legs on a stick.

24:21.128 --> 24:23.195
Frog. No shit.

24:23.197 --> 24:26.198
This, um...

24:26.200 --> 24:29.284
This whole thing is... is too much.

24:29.286 --> 24:31.870
This must've cost you a mint.

24:31.872 --> 24:35.257
You gave away $50 million this morning.

24:35.259 --> 24:37.843
I don't want to talk about money.

24:37.845 --> 24:40.546
I want to talk about you... and me.

24:40.548 --> 24:43.715
The only thing that matters is us.

24:43.717 --> 24:48.387
We'll make money. "Royal Love", whatever.

24:59.900 --> 25:02.568
Open it.

25:14.381 --> 25:16.715
It's your turn now.

25:16.717 --> 25:18.667
But you're not even divorced yet.

25:18.669 --> 25:21.803
I say as soon as the papers
come in, let's just do it.

25:21.805 --> 25:25.157
I don't want to wait anymore,
not after eight years.

25:34.268 --> 25:36.935
Will you marry me?

25:40.774 --> 25:42.908
Screw it. Yes, yes.

25:42.910 --> 25:45.244
Let's get married.

25:45.246 --> 25:48.197
Let's get married.

26:15.276 --> 26:17.809
So, you know that thing
that we were talking about?

26:17.811 --> 26:20.112
Uh-huh. Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

26:21.949 --> 26:25.317
What thing?

26:25.319 --> 26:27.486
"Royal Love", with Adam.

26:27.488 --> 26:30.155
- He's not into it.
- Oh. Well...

26:30.157 --> 26:31.456
He will be.

26:31.458 --> 26:34.559
You just got to give him the right reason.

26:34.561 --> 26:37.228
That's all. I trust you. You know why?

26:37.581 --> 26:39.164
'Cause you're a winner.

26:39.166 --> 26:42.167
Thank you very much for
the vote of confidence,

26:42.169 --> 26:45.003
but he really is pretty out of it.

26:45.005 --> 26:46.972
Well, I've seen you at
the top of your game,

26:46.974 --> 26:49.424
- and I think you're gonna deliver.
- Not this time.

26:49.426 --> 26:52.010
I'm sorry. P.S.

26:52.012 --> 26:54.546
You're doubting your
own powers, aren't you?

26:54.548 --> 26:56.515
Creepy, little kid. Follow me.

26:56.517 --> 26:58.567
Let me show you something.

26:59.987 --> 27:01.770
Oh-ho-ho!

27:01.772 --> 27:05.857
Oh. Oh, you feel that?

27:05.859 --> 27:10.746
That is what it's like to be
in control, to be the boss.

27:10.748 --> 27:13.115
You control the machine.

27:13.117 --> 27:18.203
You can make it do whatever you like.

27:20.174 --> 27:24.176
What do you say we take her for a spin?

27:30.517 --> 27:32.184
Hey.

27:32.186 --> 27:33.885
Hey.

27:35.306 --> 27:39.423
So, um... listen, uh...

27:39.676 --> 27:44.846
I know we've been going
'round and 'round, but...

27:44.848 --> 27:46.933
I actually think you were right.

27:47.012 --> 27:48.761
We have been moving too fast.

27:48.764 --> 27:51.966
Look, I... I told you I didn't mean that.

27:51.968 --> 27:54.134
I was just upset, confused.

27:54.136 --> 27:58.305
You know, you and Rachel have...

28:00.142 --> 28:02.142
You and Rachel.

28:03.980 --> 28:05.896
Don't do this.

28:05.898 --> 28:10.084
We have plans, Jer, for a life.

28:10.086 --> 28:13.237
Rachel, she's... she's
there, and then she's gone.

28:13.239 --> 28:14.738
She puts on a good show,

28:14.740 --> 28:17.992
but she doesn't give a damn
about anybody but herself.

28:17.994 --> 28:23.080
Look, you deserve someone who's
gonna love you all the way.

28:23.082 --> 28:26.550
You know? No regrets...

28:26.552 --> 28:28.886
No holding back.

28:28.939 --> 28:33.241
I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm not that guy.

28:42.068 --> 28:43.851
It's fun, isn't it?!

28:43.853 --> 28:45.402
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

28:45.404 --> 28:48.022
This is every day for
me... the life, the show,

28:48.024 --> 28:50.591
it's all coming at me at 80 miles per hour.

28:50.593 --> 28:51.825
Copy that.

28:51.827 --> 28:54.612
And I make it work,
even when it gets scary.

28:55.331 --> 28:56.997
- Which it does.
- Hey, Chet, what are you doing?

28:56.999 --> 28:59.482
- Stop pushing my leg!
- More than you know!

28:59.484 --> 29:00.901
Chet!

29:03.539 --> 29:06.306
Ah, as much shit as I give
you, Rachel, I love you for it.

29:06.308 --> 29:07.507
You know something, I
really don't like this.

29:07.509 --> 29:08.976
If you really want to make it, Rachel,

29:08.978 --> 29:10.427
you got to be willing to drive the car

29:10.429 --> 29:11.962
as fast as it'll take you.

29:11.964 --> 29:14.715
Even when you feel this
close to crashing and burning,

29:14.717 --> 29:18.468
- you've got to just keep driving!
- Chet, let go of my leg!

29:19.605 --> 29:21.055
There's nothing you can't do, Rachel!

29:21.057 --> 29:22.389
- Nothing!
- Chet!

29:31.567 --> 29:34.117
Ah, well, lesson learned.

29:34.119 --> 29:38.155
I just wish someone had done
that for me when I was your age.

29:38.157 --> 29:42.076
Now... go get me Adam.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.407
These numbers are too low.

29:54.409 --> 29:55.908
These numbers are too high.

29:55.910 --> 29:57.777
These numbers don't equal this total.

29:57.779 --> 30:00.496
So whoever did this must've
been high or half asleep.

30:00.498 --> 30:02.114
I don't care.

30:05.620 --> 30:07.169
Okay.

30:07.171 --> 30:08.921
You know what? Just go...
go... go get it fixed.

30:08.923 --> 30:10.706
I don't care how you do
it. Just get it fixed.

30:10.708 --> 30:11.924
- Hey, hey.
- Thank you.

30:11.926 --> 30:13.459
Uh, what was that all about?

30:13.461 --> 30:15.428
Ah, some people just need to
be reminded of their power.

30:15.430 --> 30:17.129
If we're gonna make that spin-off money,

30:17.131 --> 30:19.532
she's got to come through.

30:19.534 --> 30:20.933
Oh.

30:20.935 --> 30:23.135
Hey, why don't you, uh...

30:23.137 --> 30:24.770
Why don't you check her out?

30:24.772 --> 30:26.522
Make sure she got the message.

30:26.524 --> 30:27.807
Okay.

30:29.310 --> 30:32.478
Whew.

30:36.217 --> 30:38.618
Are you okay?

30:39.737 --> 30:43.155
You need to pull your shit together.

30:43.157 --> 30:45.491
Excuse me?

30:45.493 --> 30:47.376
I mean, what is wrong with you?

30:47.378 --> 30:49.078
You used to be like a shark.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.197
Dead eyes, no emotion, no weakness.

30:51.199 --> 30:52.498
- And now look at you.
- I'm sorry.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.133
Are you honestly taking his side?

30:54.135 --> 30:56.135
Because the guy basically
tried to drive me off a cliff.

30:56.137 --> 30:59.087
- Oh, please.
- Holy crap.

30:59.089 --> 31:00.222
- That's a nice ring.
- Yeah.

31:00.224 --> 31:01.390
Yeah.

31:01.392 --> 31:03.142
Chet and I are together now,

31:03.144 --> 31:05.394
so you need to suck it up and do your job.

31:05.396 --> 31:08.731
Yeah, right. Which is what,
exactly? I just want to clarify.

31:08.733 --> 31:10.650
You want me to go into Adam's room
and convince him to do something

31:10.652 --> 31:12.018
that he doesn't want to do, right?

31:12.020 --> 31:15.438
Hell, yeah. Since when is that news?

31:15.440 --> 31:17.189
Okay, how would you like me to do it?

31:17.191 --> 31:18.858
Because you've taken away his winery.

31:18.860 --> 31:21.277
You've turned it into the
"Everlasting" theme park.

31:21.279 --> 31:23.613
And now you're asking me
to get him back on board

31:23.615 --> 31:25.197
with his family, whom he loathes,

31:25.199 --> 31:27.867
and, quite honestly, they're
not crazy about him, either.

31:27.869 --> 31:30.586
Why are you letting Adam
get up all in your vag?

31:30.588 --> 31:33.055
He's a prop, Rachel.

31:34.676 --> 31:39.345
Because maybe I'm just sick
of being a manipulative bitch.

31:39.347 --> 31:40.680
Oh.

31:40.682 --> 31:43.516
Well, let me tell you, sweetheart,

31:43.518 --> 31:46.235
there's no sense fighting that.

31:46.237 --> 31:48.020
That's who we are.

31:51.359 --> 31:53.359
Where are you going?

31:53.361 --> 31:58.030
To be a manipulative bitch.

31:58.032 --> 31:59.332
No means no.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.200
Unless it gets you something you want.

32:01.202 --> 32:02.535
Which is?

32:02.537 --> 32:04.870
Which is your vineyard...
Adam Cromwell Winery.

32:04.872 --> 32:07.340
Fat chance. It's the
"Everlasting" spa and resort now.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.425
Not if you tell Chet you're
gonna do "Royal Love".

32:09.427 --> 32:14.213
But only as "Royal Renovations".

32:14.215 --> 32:15.881
Okay, you cut a deal for the show,

32:15.883 --> 32:17.683
and you insist that they
shoot it at the vineyard.

32:17.685 --> 32:19.268
And we spend the entire
season renovating it

32:19.270 --> 32:20.770
and putting it online,

32:20.772 --> 32:22.772
and you are not gonna commit

32:22.774 --> 32:25.057
unless you get the vineyard
back at the end of the year.

32:25.059 --> 32:26.776
I am talking about the classy cromwell one.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.311
I'm not talking about the
cheesy "Everlasting" one.

32:29.313 --> 32:31.981
And I know that it's
another year of your life,

32:31.983 --> 32:34.900
but at the end of it, you
get everything you want.

32:34.902 --> 32:36.318
Okay, tell me.

32:36.320 --> 32:38.654
Tell me that that's not
gonna impress your father.

32:38.656 --> 32:41.290
It's actually not a bad idea.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.577
But getting married on reality TV?

32:44.579 --> 32:45.911
No, just forget it.

32:45.913 --> 32:48.213
Okay. So you pick Anna.

32:48.315 --> 32:51.917
You propose to her, and
then you just put it off.

32:51.919 --> 32:54.387
So she's your fiancée
for one year. Big deal.

32:54.389 --> 32:56.472
You spend a year of your
life with some beautiful,

32:56.474 --> 32:58.391
smart, sexy woman, and...

32:58.393 --> 33:00.593
You know, when the show's over,

33:00.595 --> 33:03.429
you can... you can do whatever you want.

33:03.431 --> 33:04.814
No marriage.

33:04.816 --> 33:06.515
Not unless you want to.

33:06.517 --> 33:09.068
Okay. So let's say I was interested.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.604
- Mm-hmm.
- What would I need to do?

33:11.606 --> 33:14.740
You just got to get Anna back.

33:16.611 --> 33:19.111
Right.

33:22.116 --> 33:23.749
Madison!

33:23.751 --> 33:25.334
This might qualify as coffee

33:25.336 --> 33:27.753
from whatever fly-over
state you came out of,

33:27.755 --> 33:29.955
but there is no way I'm drinking
this hillbilly monkey piss,

33:29.957 --> 33:33.042
so get your butt down to the
corner and get me a real latte.

33:33.044 --> 33:36.212
I got it.

33:36.214 --> 33:39.465
Word of advice... don't
roll over for Quinn.

33:39.467 --> 33:40.766
She likes the pushback.

33:40.768 --> 33:42.885
I mean, don't... don't be disrespectful,

33:42.887 --> 33:44.887
but get in the ring, have a little fun.

33:44.889 --> 33:48.724
I'm... I'm not scared of
Quinn, if that's what you mean.

33:48.726 --> 33:51.227
Mm. Guess that's why you flinch
every time she talks, huh?

33:51.229 --> 33:54.246
I don't really care how Quinn talks to me.

33:54.248 --> 33:56.782
I have wanted to be in this business

33:56.784 --> 34:00.619
ever since I was a little
girl, and here I am doing it.

34:00.621 --> 34:02.571
Glamorous life of a P.A., huh?

34:02.573 --> 34:04.824
For now.

34:06.744 --> 34:09.545
Hey.

34:09.547 --> 34:11.746
Hey. Hi. Hi.

34:11.748 --> 34:13.165
Um, so...

34:13.167 --> 34:16.418
I broke up with Lizzie.

34:16.820 --> 34:20.306
You what? Are you serious?

34:20.308 --> 34:22.475
Are you gonna... are you okay?

34:22.476 --> 34:24.876
Yeah, Rach, I'm more than okay.

34:24.878 --> 34:27.012
You know, I was just sick
of ignoring the obvious.

34:27.014 --> 34:29.014
What obvious?

34:29.016 --> 34:30.850
It's you.

34:32.687 --> 34:35.571
I just... I don't...

34:35.572 --> 34:38.072
I'm not even sure...

34:49.453 --> 34:52.254
You sure now?

34:53.255 --> 34:54.623
Okay, people... two minutes.

34:54.625 --> 34:56.041
Two minutes.

34:56.043 --> 34:59.879
After wrap, meet me in your truck.

34:59.881 --> 35:03.382
Seriously, it's gonna be good.

35:03.384 --> 35:04.850
- Yeah.
- I promise.

35:10.274 --> 35:12.775
Okay, guys, here we go! Places, please!

35:12.777 --> 35:13.976
And action!

35:13.978 --> 35:15.394
Good evening, and welcome.

35:15.396 --> 35:17.396
It's a sad night here at the mansion,

35:17.398 --> 35:19.398
as one of our four remaining contestants

35:19.400 --> 35:21.650
- will be leaving us...
- I'm sorry to interrupt you, uh, Graham...

35:21.652 --> 35:24.069
but there's something, um, I
would like to get off my chest

35:24.071 --> 35:26.205
before the elimination,
if that's all right.

35:26.207 --> 35:29.074
Of course, Adam, yes. What is it?

35:29.076 --> 35:31.911
Uh, Anna, my behavior on our
date today was inexcusable,

35:31.913 --> 35:34.246
and I was wondering if we might
have a moment alone together

35:34.248 --> 35:35.464
before the ceremony.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.750
Yeah, of course.

35:37.752 --> 35:39.919
Okay.

35:39.921 --> 35:41.503
"A" cam, stay with Anna.

35:41.505 --> 35:44.924
And Adam on "B" cam go
wide, please? Thank you.

35:57.905 --> 36:00.072
I am sorry about today.

36:00.074 --> 36:03.192
I was upset, and I wanted you to know

36:03.194 --> 36:05.244
that it had nothing to do with you.

36:05.246 --> 36:08.280
It's, uh...

36:10.084 --> 36:13.953
It's just overwhelming sometimes...

36:13.955 --> 36:15.454
Trying to remember who I am

36:15.456 --> 36:17.923
and what I want in the
middle of all this, and...

36:17.925 --> 36:19.191
It's easy to forget

36:19.193 --> 36:22.461
that I actually have
real feelings and desires.

36:22.463 --> 36:24.713
And what's crazy

36:24.715 --> 36:27.132
is that I know that you
and I have a connection.

36:27.134 --> 36:31.303
And I... I'd really like to
take the time to explore that.

36:31.305 --> 36:32.721
So would I.

36:32.723 --> 36:34.773
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:34.775 --> 36:38.777
Let's do that.

36:52.326 --> 36:55.327
Chet, look at this. Look...

36:55.329 --> 36:58.163
Oh. Uh, Chet?

37:36.587 --> 37:38.838
Have you made your choice, Adam?

37:38.840 --> 37:43.126
Yes, I have.

38:01.479 --> 38:03.229
Can't say I'm shocked.

38:03.231 --> 38:06.649
This entire show has been
an obscene waste of my time.

38:10.071 --> 38:11.404
Well...

38:11.406 --> 38:13.956
That's the last of my girls.

38:14.158 --> 38:16.508
- I'm out. Bye
-bye, Jay.

38:16.510 --> 38:17.293
Sorry, buddy.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.462
Bye, Jay.

38:20.882 --> 38:24.500
See you next season, chica.

38:32.060 --> 38:34.344
Mm.

38:34.346 --> 38:38.648
Try not to blow anything up, okay?

39:24.195 --> 39:26.112
- Hey.
- Tell me that one later.

39:26.114 --> 39:27.397
Yeah, okay.

39:27.399 --> 39:29.315
All right. Hey.

39:30.017 --> 39:34.136
Hi. You were right.

39:34.138 --> 39:35.037
Me?

39:35.039 --> 39:37.223
We should get married as soon as we can...

39:37.225 --> 39:38.924
As soon as the papers come through.

39:38.926 --> 39:42.411
Us, Vegas, Elvis impersonator.

39:42.413 --> 39:43.913
Let's do it.

39:43.915 --> 39:46.049
That's amazing. Yes!

39:54.376 --> 39:56.593
Hey.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.879
- Hey.
- Do you need something?

39:58.881 --> 40:00.147
Uh, no.

40:00.149 --> 40:03.183
I just wanted to come by
and see that you were...

40:03.185 --> 40:04.568
Okay with everything.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.787
Yeah, like a dog with two tails.

40:06.789 --> 40:09.290
Gonna get everything I ever wanted, right?

40:10.228 --> 40:14.097
Yeah, well, it seems like things
went really well with Anna.

40:14.099 --> 40:16.516
Yeah. It did. She's... she's lovely.

40:16.518 --> 40:18.435
But we've been on two dates, and what...

40:18.437 --> 40:20.987
We're gonna commit to each
other for an entire year...

40:20.989 --> 40:23.856
- Adam, come on.
- What if I find out she drives me insane?

40:23.958 --> 40:26.725
Or I her. What're we gonna do then?

40:26.727 --> 40:28.811
Just fake it for a year?

40:28.813 --> 40:29.362
You know something?

40:29.364 --> 40:31.114
It's not even about feeling
anything or faking it.

40:31.116 --> 40:33.033
It's just about getting what you want.

40:33.035 --> 40:37.287
What if I can't have what I truly want?

40:47.518 --> 40:48.717
Rach.

40:50.688 --> 40:54.106
Rach.
