00:01.669 --> 00:04.570
<i>- Previously on
"The Magicians"...</i>

00:04.572 --> 00:05.971
We summoned some kind of killer
moth man from another world.

00:05.973 --> 00:07.506
My friends who got separated
and I just...

00:07.508 --> 00:09.141
I can't let them fight
the beast on their own.

00:09.143 --> 00:10.909
<i>- You want me to come
to Fillory with you?</i>

00:10.911 --> 00:12.745
- All right, so there might be
a solution here, a weapon.

00:12.747 --> 00:14.113
<i>It's something that
if we could find it,</i>

00:14.115 --> 00:15.614
<i>we could use it
to kill the beast.</i>

00:15.616 --> 00:17.282
- Payment is due.
- Apparently marriage here

00:17.284 --> 00:19.485
- is different.
- I can never leave Fillory.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.487
- I have gifted you my bestowal,

00:21.489 --> 00:23.622
<i>when you are ready
to face the beast.</i>

00:23.624 --> 00:24.857
<i>Imbibe it.</i>

00:24.859 --> 00:26.325
- We followed all the clues.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.861
<i>We thought
that she was leading us to her.</i>

00:28.863 --> 00:30.529
<i>We summoned her.</i>

00:30.531 --> 00:33.966
You know, I actually believed
our lady underground chose me.

00:33.968 --> 00:36.168
<i>- You may address me
as Reynard the fox,</i>

00:36.170 --> 00:38.971
trickster of the faithful,
the pure of heart,

00:38.973 --> 00:42.875
the very stupid.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.810
- Hi, Martin.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.219
- Ahh!

00:54.221 --> 00:55.454
- Wait.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.688
You know how to deal with gods.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.957
You know how to fuck up
their shit.

00:58.959 --> 01:01.293
- I want to make a deal.
- Let's.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:22.716 --> 01:25.150
- Help!

01:27.988 --> 01:31.223
- Somebody!

01:42.169 --> 01:43.902
- There's gotta be someone

01:43.904 --> 01:47.739
in this motherfucking
goddamn magical forest.

01:49.176 --> 01:51.009
- Get up.

01:51.011 --> 01:55.247
People are dying.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.207
- Hungry, I assume?

02:22.209 --> 02:25.410
After all that being chased?

02:25.412 --> 02:27.112
- No, um, I'm not being chased.

02:27.114 --> 02:30.215
- Oh.
- Usually they're being chased.

02:30.217 --> 02:33.785
- That I know of, no.

02:33.787 --> 02:37.756
- But you do need
some kind of help.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.658
- Uh, it's just where
I come from there's a legend

02:39.660 --> 02:43.162
about a witch
with a cottage made of candy.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.596
- Well, the cottage
is mostly wood,

02:44.598 --> 02:47.166
and I'm more of a healer and...

02:47.168 --> 02:49.001
Gardening enthusiast.

02:49.003 --> 02:52.271
- Okay.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.672
I need your help.

02:53.674 --> 02:56.175
- And you're offering...?

02:56.177 --> 02:59.411
- Offering? Um...
- Gold... Is always good.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.613
- You would be helping
the next high king of Fillory.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.081
- Okay.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.950
Then my discount rate.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.185
One vial.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.020
- Vial of what?

03:08.022 --> 03:09.454
- Were you dropped on your head
as a child?

03:09.456 --> 03:13.091
Your blood, dum-dum.

03:20.334 --> 03:23.168
- There you are.

03:23.170 --> 03:26.338
We were so worried.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.407
- You're, uh...

03:31.844 --> 03:36.181
- God-powered.

03:36.183 --> 03:39.251
So it's a little hard
to kill me at the moment.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.790
- Ahh!

03:44.792 --> 03:47.459
- Thank god.

03:47.461 --> 03:50.362
I mean, you know,

03:50.364 --> 03:53.432
thank god, Alice.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.005
- I hesitated.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.707
With the beast,
I should have... it's...

04:01.709 --> 04:02.908
It's my fault.

04:02.910 --> 04:03.909
- No, it's not, I...

04:03.911 --> 04:05.310
- no, he's right.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.311
It's Julia's fault.

04:06.313 --> 04:07.679
- No, guys.

04:07.681 --> 04:10.048
- She... she's not sane.
- You think?

04:10.050 --> 04:11.416
- One small consolation

04:11.418 --> 04:13.185
is the bitch is
with the beast right now,

04:13.187 --> 04:15.153
and I can't really see
that going her way.

04:15.155 --> 04:18.523
- No, it, uh,
I'll explain it in a second.

04:18.524 --> 04:21.226
Um, can I have
my blood back, please?

04:22.896 --> 04:24.096
- Look, my friends,
they're fine.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.698
- I don't need your...
- no.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.868
I took an hour out of my night.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.070
You're in Fillory, magician.

04:32.072 --> 04:34.273
Be careful with strangers.

04:34.275 --> 04:37.009
We only look whimsical.

04:40.546 --> 04:43.215
- Who was that?
- Uh, a local.

04:43.217 --> 04:46.451
- Okay, fuckers, huddle up.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.120
Zillion bucks says the beast
comes back any minute,

04:48.122 --> 04:49.554
so what's the plan?

04:49.556 --> 04:52.758
- We lost the blade,
so we need a new something.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.227
Um, especially while Alice
is still...

04:55.229 --> 04:56.795
- Juiced up?
- We should all juice up.

04:56.797 --> 05:00.132
Like the beast.
Wellspring smoothies, stat.

05:09.643 --> 05:13.211
- Ahh!
- Shit.

05:13.213 --> 05:15.380
- There's a missing piece
right there.

05:15.382 --> 05:17.316
- Oh, hey, I think I...
- Uh, yeah.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.718
Ahh!

05:19.720 --> 05:20.986
- This is going great.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.055
- Let me try.

05:30.596 --> 05:33.665
- Wow, swallowing has
its privileges.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.488
- Wow, it looks like...
- A major drought's hit.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.557
- There's a bucket.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.332
Shit.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.639
I knew the beast came here
every day, but is it...

06:14.641 --> 06:16.108
But is it even possible for him

06:16.110 --> 06:17.709
to drain the wellspring
that much?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.378
- He really threw something
out of whack.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.012
- I vote we don't touch it
on the grounds

06:21.014 --> 06:22.881
that exploding Fillory
wouldn't help.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.282
- Okay.
- We need a new plan.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.184
- What plan?
- The beast is gone.

06:26.186 --> 06:29.020
Our squad is a joke.
What plan, exactly?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.655
- We'll figure it out.
- We always do.

06:30.657 --> 06:32.457
- When it's a final to cheat on,

06:32.459 --> 06:34.693
not when we're stuck
in some epic fantasy

06:34.695 --> 06:39.164
that likes to behead its heroes
halfway through season one.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.734
If we even are heroes.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.804
We might be comic relief.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.841
I thought you threw that out.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.911
- It's for emergencies.
- Pass it around.

06:52.913 --> 06:56.748
- Okay.
- No wellspring, no knife.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.050
- I have no idea what to do now.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.919
- So we are fucked
without grease.

07:00.921 --> 07:04.756
- That sounds like us.
- Must be a Monday.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.825
Onward to glory.

07:20.907 --> 07:23.975
- Ah, much better.

07:28.714 --> 07:30.215
- Why are... are we...

07:30.217 --> 07:32.250
- ah, the food is tremendous.

07:32.252 --> 07:35.854
Let's sit.

07:35.856 --> 07:39.090
- You familiar?
- Word as bond?

07:39.092 --> 07:42.260
Uh, I assume the extra bits
enchant the blade

07:42.262 --> 07:44.062
to kill me instantly

07:44.064 --> 07:47.599
in the event I break it, eh.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.367
- Okay, here's the deal...

07:49.369 --> 07:52.070
- you need to kill a god.

07:52.072 --> 07:54.239
Thrilling.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.107
So you need to get near him.

07:56.109 --> 07:59.744
- Tricky.
- Yes, but you can help.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.813
- Mm.

08:01.815 --> 08:05.083
- His... Name
is Reynard the fox.

08:05.085 --> 08:08.220
- A trickster of some sorts,
yes?

08:08.222 --> 08:10.255
Oh, that will be a challenge.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.424
- Well, you don't really have
much choice, do you?

08:12.426 --> 08:15.827
- Oh, well aware you have
that stylish little blade.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.096
- I sure do.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.632
- That reminds me to insist
the terms of our deal

08:20.634 --> 08:23.068
include said blade
reverting to me

08:23.070 --> 08:25.437
at the moment
of Reynard's demise.

08:25.439 --> 08:27.772
- Agreed?
- Almost.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.608
First, for the duration
of our agreement,

08:29.610 --> 08:31.843
you do not hurt
or act against me in any way.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.145
- Mm, fine.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.782
- Quentin, all of them.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.818
You lay a finger,

08:40.821 --> 08:45.090
this will put this

08:45.092 --> 08:48.627
in the base of your skull.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.262
- You're not what I expected.

08:50.264 --> 08:53.598
- Once Reynard is dead,
I put the knife down.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.967
Yours to take.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.670
- So this Reynard's
still out there?

08:58.672 --> 09:00.372
- As far as she knows.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.973
Yeah, it's why she needed
the knife

09:01.975 --> 09:03.508
and why she needs the beast.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.777
- Okay, I get it now,
but I also have to say

09:05.779 --> 09:08.647
that is the dumbest thing
she could possibly have done.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.283
- Like I said,
she's not sane right now.

09:11.285 --> 09:12.951
- I wouldn't be.
- So what are we supposed to do?

09:12.953 --> 09:15.020
- Kill the beast.
- He's right.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.488
You know, it's awful,

09:16.490 --> 09:18.290
but she chose
to double cross us.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.959
- Look, I'm pissed too,
but I would like to point out...

09:20.961 --> 09:22.727
- okay, we don't have to take
a vote right this second.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.529
Penny's right.
First things first.

09:24.531 --> 09:27.198
We need to make a plan
to deal with the beast.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.833
- Eliot!

09:28.835 --> 09:30.235
I thought for sure you...

09:30.237 --> 09:33.138
- yeah, me too.
- Not yet.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.640
- Are... are you all right?

09:35.642 --> 09:38.577
Um, I'll... I'll get everyone
something to eat.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.645
- That would be amazing.

09:42.882 --> 09:46.518
I think I like her.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.587
I hope I like her.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.761
- Um, okay.
- This might be something.

09:56.763 --> 10:00.365
Um, so there's a-a-a place

10:00.367 --> 10:01.833
called the armory.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.102
- Weapons?
- Books.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.205
Uh, so Rupert Chatwin,

10:07.207 --> 10:10.008
uh, he realizes that back home,

10:10.010 --> 10:11.376
world war ii is still raging

10:11.378 --> 10:13.945
and he tells Jane and Martin
that he is going...

10:13.947 --> 10:16.748
He's... he's going to go fight.
Before he does,

10:16.750 --> 10:19.851
uh, he spends all night
in the armory reading.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.687
Uh, and, uh, you know,
like, whatever he finds,

10:22.689 --> 10:25.056
it doesn't say,

10:25.058 --> 10:29.527
but his next move
is to petition ember and umber

10:29.529 --> 10:31.129
for strength.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.931
I mean, what...
What if he found something.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.266
What if he found, uh, a spell

10:35.268 --> 10:38.870
or a piece of, I don't know,
Fillorian battle magic

10:38.872 --> 10:40.739
that was so strong
that he couldn't do it without...

10:40.741 --> 10:42.440
- Without juice?
- Yeah, because the...

10:42.442 --> 10:45.276
Okay, the thing is this is, uh,

10:45.278 --> 10:48.947
December, 1944.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.649
I mean, he shows up
right in the middle of the...

10:50.651 --> 10:54.552
- battle of the bulge.

10:54.554 --> 10:58.056
Wait, are you saying
that Rupert secretly...

10:58.058 --> 11:00.725
- I'm saying...
- Uh,

11:00.727 --> 11:04.996
maybe he found something
powerful enough to help.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.065
- And win world war ii?

11:07.067 --> 11:10.802
- Maybe.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.238
- Well then, I need the armory.
- Where is it?

11:13.240 --> 11:16.808
- Castle Whitespire.
- Accessible to...

11:16.810 --> 11:17.809
The king.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.245
- Oh, hey.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.781
- And if we can find
the road, there's, um,

11:22.783 --> 11:25.450
a carriage that runs
in a continuous circle, uh,

11:25.452 --> 11:27.952
also at the disposal
of the king, so...

11:27.954 --> 11:31.523
- Okay.
- Whitespire it is.

11:31.525 --> 11:34.592
Come on, everybody.
Grab snacks.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.327
- Yeah, uh, about that.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.529
My hands are in a fucking box,

11:37.531 --> 11:40.098
so Chatwin's torrent.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.967
- I-i know that one.
- It's, um, it's a healing river.

11:42.969 --> 11:45.170
- Can it reattach hands?
- Maybe.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.439
- I'm going.
- I'll catch you on the flip.

11:47.441 --> 11:49.307
- Wait, no, I don't think
you should be going alone.

11:49.309 --> 11:53.111
- I'll go.
- Um, healing water?

11:53.113 --> 11:56.181
We're going to battle.
I'll grab, like, a gallon.

11:59.618 --> 12:02.687
You're wiping your own ass,
so figure that out.

12:15.167 --> 12:17.702
- Souvenir?
- Barometer.

12:17.704 --> 12:21.539
Thought I should pay attention
to see if it gets warm.

12:25.479 --> 12:28.379
- Whoa. Hey, guys.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.181
Hey, over here!

12:30.183 --> 12:32.183
- Oh, my god,
those horses are so beautiful.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.918
- Uh, hey.
- What are you doing?

12:33.920 --> 12:36.421
- I just really love horses.
- Come on.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.756
- Hup!

12:40.226 --> 12:42.694
- You have got to be kidding me.

12:42.696 --> 12:44.729
- I know, those horses
were so rude.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.231
- I guess they're a tad literal.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.266
- Yeah. I'd call needing to see
an actual crown

12:48.268 --> 12:50.101
on my head
as pretty goddamn literal.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.437
- Look, it's not just
about the carriage.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.272
They're not gonna let us
in to Whitespire

12:54.274 --> 12:56.274
until you've been crowned
high king, so...

12:56.276 --> 12:59.577
- We... we need to get you
crowned.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.514
Uh...

13:02.516 --> 13:04.783
Okay, yeah.
Um, so there's a...

13:04.785 --> 13:08.286
There's a specific
coronation place

13:08.288 --> 13:10.088
in the forest.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.623
- There are four kings
and queens.

13:11.625 --> 13:16.261
- Yeah, you get to pick
the other three.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.729
Do I get to be a king?

13:17.731 --> 13:19.464
- Unless you want me
to pick penny.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.134
- So, okay, so we get
to the coronation spot

13:23.136 --> 13:25.203
by crossing the rainbow bridge.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.273
- Rainbow bridge? Like where
family pets go when they die?

13:28.275 --> 13:30.308
- No. I mean,
not that I know of.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.777
No, it's called that because of
the flowers that are everywhere.

13:32.779 --> 13:35.079
- Oh.
- Um, but there is, of course,

13:35.081 --> 13:36.881
no map,

13:36.883 --> 13:40.151
but I know Martin found it
with a spell.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.922
- Well, we could always
just ask around.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.591
- Or we could make like Martin.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.408
He loves me.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.943
He loves me not.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.312
He loves me.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.514
He loves me not.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.584
Uh, he loves me.
Let's go.

14:23.829 --> 14:26.965
- Ah.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.001
Uh, please know
I heard every loophole.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.770
"Put the knife down."

14:32.772 --> 14:35.607
You really think
you have a fighting chance?

14:35.609 --> 14:38.509
- I think I'm gonna
give it my best.

14:38.511 --> 14:41.346
- Oh, this is going to be fun.

14:44.684 --> 14:47.185
- Nice of Reynard to pull
so many hearts out of chests.

14:47.187 --> 14:51.623
It's, uh, distinctive.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.925
Why do you suppose he does that?

14:53.927 --> 14:58.763
- He likes the taste.
- Mm.

14:58.765 --> 15:01.699
Brilliant, that, uh, laptop.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.469
The things they come up with
when they don't have magic.

15:04.471 --> 15:07.605
- Yeah, like accounts that tweet
police scanner activity.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.007
- "Tweet"?

15:09.009 --> 15:12.377
Birds have computer accounts?

15:12.379 --> 15:14.612
- Don't worry about it.

15:14.614 --> 15:18.182
- Mm.
- Wait a minute.

15:18.184 --> 15:21.286
They found five bodies
at a house in Florida.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.054
Missing a couple of hearts.

15:26.793 --> 15:31.195
Okay, just try to keep people
away for a minute.

15:32.131 --> 15:35.300
- Nicely.
- Mm-hmm.

15:35.302 --> 15:38.636
- Hey, is this seat taken?

15:44.743 --> 15:45.843
- Excuse me, sir, this is...

15:45.845 --> 15:47.912
- won't be but a moment.

16:18.944 --> 16:21.245
- He's still in Richard's body.

16:21.247 --> 16:24.182
- Richard doesn't care, darling.

16:24.184 --> 16:28.886
- I fucking do.

16:28.888 --> 16:31.723
Well, so I guess
we came for not much.

16:31.725 --> 16:34.959
- On the contrary, we've
verified what attracts Reynard.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.594
- What?
- Witches doing rituals?

16:36.596 --> 16:38.296
I mean, that's thousands
of people every day.

16:38.298 --> 16:41.366
- Not this type of ritual.

16:44.436 --> 16:46.170
Come on.

16:55.115 --> 16:58.449
- So, what do I do?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.585
- Well, per the books,

17:00.587 --> 17:04.222
you strip and jump in, I guess.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.223
Here, I'll help you.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.593
- You'll need to help him
sew those back on his wrists.

17:08.595 --> 17:11.295
- Who are you?
- I watch the river.

17:11.297 --> 17:14.365
And assist those
who require its magic.

17:17.403 --> 17:19.470
- This guy is fucking weird.

17:27.112 --> 17:29.013
- Go on.

17:37.589 --> 17:39.657
Go. Go, go.

17:48.167 --> 17:50.535
You know, you're very beautiful.

17:50.537 --> 17:52.370
Where are you from, hmm?

17:52.372 --> 17:53.671
Earth?

17:53.673 --> 17:56.674
Love women from earth.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.876
- Is it supposed
to take this long?

17:58.878 --> 18:02.146
- No.
- He may have drowned.

18:02.148 --> 18:03.848
- Are you kidding?
- Why didn't you...

18:03.850 --> 18:07.852
- oh, oh, oh.
- There we go.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.221
Are you sure I can't interest
you in an elixir?

18:10.223 --> 18:12.156
It... it's small batch
and very fresh.

18:12.158 --> 18:14.725
- No, thank you.
- I have a tooth powder

18:14.727 --> 18:16.561
that I think
you are going to love.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.863
- You know what?
- We're kinda in a hurry.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.132
- I understand.
- As you wish.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.201
Pleasure to serve.

18:25.337 --> 18:26.571
- I think he wants a tip.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.573
- 20 gold pieces is customary.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.308
- Okay, that sounds like a lot.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.742
- Well, this is
Chatwin's torrent.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.744
- We don't have...
- There was nothing

18:33.746 --> 18:35.513
about charging in the books.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.849
- Oh, uh, you'd rather pay
in labor?

18:37.851 --> 18:39.383
I think three to five years.

18:39.385 --> 18:41.486
- Are you fucking kidding me?

18:41.488 --> 18:43.754
You said none of this
before I went in the river.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.389
- Because I have manners...

18:45.391 --> 18:47.892
- are you even officially
affiliated with the torrent?

18:47.894 --> 18:49.160
- Penny, chill out.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.561
- It's kind of
an amateur calling.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.563
- Oh, I see.
- Yes, yes, you're a con man.

18:52.565 --> 18:55.533
- No, penny...
- No, I know his type.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.502
I've been ripped off
plenty of times

18:57.504 --> 19:01.239
by smiling little snake oil
pricks like this dude.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.707
- Okay, all right.
- Same in Detroit,

19:02.709 --> 19:05.610
same in Mumbai, same in Fillory.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.778
Sorry, try it on the next sap

19:07.780 --> 19:12.416
who needs this natural resource
on public property.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.185
Good luck.

19:14.187 --> 19:17.054
- I'm sorry.
- He gets touchy.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.223
It's... it's not personal.

19:19.225 --> 19:22.460
Um, these are diamond.

19:22.462 --> 19:25.796
- What the hell is diamond?
- Here.

19:25.798 --> 19:28.299
- When you meet one scammer,
you met 'em all. Let's go.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.368
- Okay.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.517
- Okay, so this net...
- This net you throw,

19:46.519 --> 19:47.985
what sort of a net
catches a god?

19:47.987 --> 19:49.387
- Oh, it's an obscure bit
of casting,

19:49.389 --> 19:51.055
but I assure you it works.

19:51.057 --> 19:53.858
We'll just have to act fast
when the time comes.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.160
It'll hold for a few seconds.

19:56.162 --> 19:59.263
So...

19:59.265 --> 20:01.332
I need a few items.

20:06.104 --> 20:09.006
- Okay, it might be better for
me to go alone for some of this.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.409
- Uh, can you drop me
at the playground?

20:11.411 --> 20:13.444
I like to watch
the little children play.

20:13.446 --> 20:16.047
It's perfectly innocent.

20:31.296 --> 20:34.065
- Al, we got your note.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.400
Let's do this.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.369
I call high queen.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.404
Did it work?

20:40.406 --> 20:42.807
- Perfect.
- Lead the way.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.987
It's fine.
They're just healing.

21:46.706 --> 21:49.640
- Do you think he's sleeping
or dead?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.309
I don't know, should we just go
into the trunk?

21:51.311 --> 21:54.445
- Oh, pussies.

21:54.447 --> 21:57.348
- He looks dead.
- I guess we're late.

22:03.855 --> 22:05.923
Oh, dear.

22:08.293 --> 22:12.363
Oh, dear.

22:17.703 --> 22:20.571
I am the knight of crowns.

22:20.573 --> 22:23.140
Uh, my apologies.

22:23.142 --> 22:27.712
I seem to have died waiting
for you aspirants to come.

22:27.714 --> 22:31.749
Y-y-you are aspirants?

22:31.751 --> 22:33.651
Uh...

22:33.653 --> 22:36.354
I'm the high king of Fillory.

22:36.356 --> 22:37.755
I took a blood test.

22:37.757 --> 22:42.560
- Excellent, excellent.
- It's an honor.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.695
- Can we have the crowns,
please?

22:44.697 --> 22:46.997
- Certainly.
- Honored to oblige.

22:46.999 --> 22:50.334
Just as soon
as you pass the test.

22:50.336 --> 22:52.570
- Of course there's a test.

22:52.572 --> 22:56.540
- As you know,
only a child of earth

22:56.542 --> 23:00.111
can wear the crown
of the high king.

23:00.113 --> 23:02.346
I will ask you
a series of questions

23:02.348 --> 23:05.015
designed to root out
all pretenders to the throne.

23:05.017 --> 23:08.018
Only a true high king
will hold the answers

23:08.020 --> 23:10.087
in his heart.

23:12.457 --> 23:15.960
- Come at me.

23:15.962 --> 23:20.097
- What popular American
television program

23:20.099 --> 23:23.067
stars actor Tim Daly?

23:23.069 --> 23:24.602
- What the fuck?

23:24.604 --> 23:26.537
- He was in a lot of TV shows.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.305
- There is only one
correct answer.

23:28.307 --> 23:30.141
- Okay.
- Give me the next question.

23:30.143 --> 23:34.545
- This hit single
is performed by offspring

23:34.547 --> 23:36.447
of famous entertainers.

23:36.449 --> 23:39.150
- Dude, that is crazy vague.

23:39.152 --> 23:41.419
- You will receive
a single hint.

23:41.421 --> 23:44.288
Your hint is beach boys.

23:44.290 --> 23:47.591
"Hold on" by Wilson Phillips.

23:47.593 --> 23:49.427
- That song is my jam.

23:49.429 --> 23:52.263
- Wait, all these questions
are from the '90s.

23:52.265 --> 23:54.999
- It... it's not the 1990s
on earth right now?

23:55.001 --> 23:56.967
- No, it... it's 2017.

23:56.969 --> 24:00.905
Oh, and it's, uh, "wings,"
the... the Tim Daly show. "Wings."

24:00.907 --> 24:05.142
- Of course you know that.
- Okay, '90s.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.745
Ask me something
about Patrick Swayze.

24:07.747 --> 24:09.814
- You know of Swayze?

24:17.823 --> 24:22.126
Ahem.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.928
"Sorry about the disruption,
folks,

24:23.930 --> 24:26.797
"but I always do the last dance
of the season.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.699
"This year somebody told me
not to.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.701
"So I'm gonna do
my kind of dancing

24:30.703 --> 24:32.436
"with a great partner,

24:32.438 --> 24:34.939
"who's not only
a terrific dancer,

24:34.941 --> 24:37.875
"somebody who's taught me

24:37.877 --> 24:39.877
"that there are people out there
willing to stand up

24:39.879 --> 24:43.347
"for other people
no matter what it costs them.

24:43.349 --> 24:47.618
"Somebody who's taught me

24:47.620 --> 24:51.288
"about the kind of person
I want to be.

24:51.290 --> 24:52.990
Miss Frances houseman."

24:52.992 --> 24:57.495
- Oh, your majesty.

24:57.497 --> 25:01.232
The crowns of Fillory are yours.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.716
- So I guess we just
put them on.

25:18.718 --> 25:20.184
- No, god, stop.

25:20.186 --> 25:24.255
I mean, I just...
We should do a-a ceremony.

25:24.257 --> 25:26.223
This is only gonna happen once.

25:26.225 --> 25:28.259
We are becoming
kings and queens,

25:28.261 --> 25:33.864
so... It's important
and we should honor it.

25:33.866 --> 25:38.369
Just give me that.

25:38.371 --> 25:41.539
Kneel, Eliot Waugh.

25:41.541 --> 25:44.642
Would you just do it?
It's gonna be quick, I promise.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.751
So, destiny is...
It's bullshit.

25:53.753 --> 25:56.720
But you are high king
in your blood.

25:56.722 --> 25:58.822
And somehow that makes sense,
you know?

25:58.824 --> 26:00.925
And I-i just...
For what it's worth,

26:00.927 --> 26:04.662
I think that you are going to be
a really good king.

26:04.664 --> 26:09.466
Um, so, um,
I-i dub thee,

26:09.468 --> 26:11.936
um, I don't know.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.171
Would you say, like,
you're more brave or merciful?

26:14.173 --> 26:16.941
- I'd say I'm neither.

26:16.943 --> 26:20.311
But I still plan to be
a spectacular monarch.

26:20.313 --> 26:22.646
- I hereby dub thee

26:22.648 --> 26:25.583
high king Eliot

26:25.585 --> 26:28.152
the spectacular.

26:31.523 --> 26:35.793
- Wow, uh,

26:35.795 --> 26:38.862
this feels as natural
as underwear.

26:43.001 --> 26:46.604
Thank you.

26:46.606 --> 26:49.340
By the power vested in me by...

26:49.342 --> 26:52.509
I have no idea,

26:52.511 --> 26:55.646
I do hereby crown you

26:55.648 --> 26:59.450
high queen Margo

26:59.452 --> 27:00.951
the destroyer.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.820
I mean that
in the best possible sense.

27:02.822 --> 27:07.191
Uh, all hail.
Everyone clap.

27:11.896 --> 27:15.399
I have known what you truly are

27:15.401 --> 27:18.369
since the day we met.

27:18.371 --> 27:20.437
Long may you reign.

27:30.248 --> 27:32.883
I feel it's incumbent upon me

27:32.885 --> 27:37.321
to promise never again
to betray you like I did.

27:37.323 --> 27:42.059
I really...
Really am sorry.

27:42.061 --> 27:46.497
I have some character defects.
I'm working on it.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.565
Honestly.

27:55.373 --> 27:58.242
- I'm working on some too.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.744
- Well, on that note,

28:00.746 --> 28:04.782
I crown you queen Alice

28:04.784 --> 28:06.617
the wise.

28:16.394 --> 28:18.595
- No, wait.

28:18.597 --> 28:21.665
Since we're cleaning slates
and shit, give me.

28:24.803 --> 28:28.539
Q.

28:28.541 --> 28:32.743
Uh, I could start
by saying something cruel

28:32.745 --> 28:35.479
yet totally hilarious about you.

28:35.481 --> 28:40.050
Let's be real,
you're an easy target.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.985
But that's...

28:41.987 --> 28:45.422
Well, that's because you're
honest about what you love.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.891
And underneath it all, that's...

28:47.893 --> 28:50.294
Inspiring.

28:51.963 --> 28:53.964
And I'm sorry too.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.466
Not about the sex,

28:55.468 --> 28:58.469
I don't even really remember it.

28:58.471 --> 29:01.805
Mostly my part in fucking up
something that was good for you.

29:01.807 --> 29:05.309
- Thanks, I think
I fucked it up just fine myself.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.444
- Now that we're ruling
a kingdom together,

29:07.446 --> 29:09.980
I hope we can be
whatever we were again.

29:09.982 --> 29:12.616
- I guess you could
call that friends.

29:12.618 --> 29:14.952
- Let's go with that.

29:14.954 --> 29:18.589
I hereby crown you king Quentin

29:18.591 --> 29:23.827
the moderately
socially maladjusted.

29:23.829 --> 29:26.897
- Scrunch down.
- Yeah.

29:37.542 --> 29:40.110
Royalty, bitches.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.524
- Okay.

29:58.897 --> 30:02.132
Shit.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.303
- Hey, everything okay?

30:06.305 --> 30:07.538
- I'm going back to the torrent.

30:07.540 --> 30:09.373
- You think that guy
did something to you

30:09.375 --> 30:11.542
'cause you were a raging douche?

30:11.544 --> 30:13.343
- I'll sweet talk him.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.846
Get him to fix my hands, then...
Then I'll head to the castle.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.915
Everything's under control.

30:31.696 --> 30:34.765
- Alice.

30:36.901 --> 30:40.037
- Apology accepted.

30:40.039 --> 30:44.374
That was you apologizing
for what you did.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.276
I just...

30:46.278 --> 30:49.479
If we survive this,
I hope we can be friends still.

30:52.750 --> 30:56.253
I know it may sound stupid,

30:56.255 --> 30:58.722
but that's what I'm mad
at you for,

30:58.724 --> 31:02.526
not... not the cheating part.

31:02.528 --> 31:07.965
The part where what you did
made me lose you.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.100
And you're a big part
of my life, Quentin.

31:10.102 --> 31:14.404
- You can never lose me, Alice.

31:14.406 --> 31:16.240
I mean, you can avoid me,
you can hate me...

31:16.242 --> 31:18.609
- I don't hate you.

31:18.611 --> 31:21.378
- Well, you can't lose me.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.447
Sorry.

31:27.252 --> 31:32.055
- I just...
- I can't stop thinking.

31:32.057 --> 31:34.758
We're gonna find
this epic spell, great.

31:34.760 --> 31:39.229
But I'm afraid I'm just gonna...

31:39.231 --> 31:41.298
Freeze again when the beast
is in front of me.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.967
- You're thinking
about it wrong.

31:43.969 --> 31:45.569
Cool under pressure
is not a talent.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.671
It's a... it's a skill,
and you need to practice.

31:47.673 --> 31:52.142
You... come on.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.444
We stood on a roof together
during the trials,

31:54.446 --> 31:55.679
and you told me that you were
afraid to see

31:55.681 --> 31:59.483
what you're really capable of.

31:59.485 --> 32:02.953
That was then.

32:02.955 --> 32:05.589
So let's see
what you can do now.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.758
- I'm not sure it'll help.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.793
- Then do it for me.
- I'm not gonna lie.

32:09.795 --> 32:13.196
I... I'm dying to see
what you can do.

32:16.034 --> 32:17.868
- I'm not a naturalist.

32:17.870 --> 32:19.436
- You know the spell, we all do.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.505
We just sucked at it.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.744
Let's see what you can do now.

32:40.625 --> 32:45.529
- Oh.
- That feels...

32:45.531 --> 32:49.733
It's just like breathing.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.803
- See?
- Nice.

33:18.196 --> 33:22.299
So how do you feel now?

33:40.218 --> 33:42.386
- We're not getting back
together.

33:42.388 --> 33:44.454
- Okay.

33:57.903 --> 34:00.504
- I've been wondering something.

34:00.506 --> 34:03.106
Why didn't Reynard kill you
with your friends?

34:03.108 --> 34:05.175
Why were you spared?

34:15.485 --> 34:17.487
You weren't spared, were you?

34:17.489 --> 34:19.456
- Look, let's not go there,
okay?

34:19.458 --> 34:21.792
- You know, when I was a boy,

34:21.793 --> 34:24.161
a man who was meant
to care for me

34:24.163 --> 34:27.364
bent me over his desk
and had me over and over

34:27.366 --> 34:30.000
every time I was alone with him.

34:30.002 --> 34:32.636
It helps me understand a truth.

34:32.638 --> 34:36.306
You're powerful or you're weak.

34:36.308 --> 34:40.043
If you're powerful,
you will survive.

34:40.045 --> 34:42.846
- So what, you're suggesting
I just get over it?

34:42.848 --> 34:44.915
- Actually, yes.

34:47.784 --> 34:51.221
- How?
- Mutate?

34:51.223 --> 34:52.522
Take over a world,

34:52.524 --> 34:54.190
kill a bunch of grad students
39 times?

34:54.193 --> 34:58.562
Eh, see, what you feel,

34:58.564 --> 35:00.697
the haunted look in your eyes,

35:00.699 --> 35:05.302
doesn't come from nowhere.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.637
- Then where does it come from?

35:07.639 --> 35:09.406
- In the center of your being,

35:09.408 --> 35:13.677
there's a tiny beating heart.

35:13.679 --> 35:15.812
- What, you mean like my soul?

35:15.814 --> 35:18.315
- Part of it, yes,
the slimmest part,

35:18.317 --> 35:21.485
but it holds specific power.

35:21.487 --> 35:23.687
It's called a shade.

35:23.689 --> 35:26.256
- Shade.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.425
- It's what makes you feel

35:28.427 --> 35:32.529
the pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

35:32.531 --> 35:34.664
And, yes, it's also there
for love,

35:34.666 --> 35:36.700
but, uh, let's be Frank,
darling,

35:36.702 --> 35:38.535
you're more likely
to throw yourself off a bridge

35:38.537 --> 35:43.406
than ever love again.

35:43.408 --> 35:46.209
I felt that way.

35:46.211 --> 35:50.080
And I knew it crippled me
when I needed to be strong.

35:50.082 --> 35:52.149
As you do now.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.991
You know...

36:04.462 --> 36:07.531
I don't care for people,
as a rule.

36:13.971 --> 36:17.040
I like you.

36:17.042 --> 36:18.542
You have promise.

36:18.544 --> 36:22.979
With the right control,
you would be formidable.

36:22.981 --> 36:27.617
Even a worthy collaborator.

36:27.619 --> 36:30.687
I have plans.
You could be part of them.

36:33.491 --> 36:35.825
- If?
- Do what I did.

36:35.827 --> 36:38.962
Sever your shade.

36:38.964 --> 36:42.165
- Sever.
- It's not hard.

36:42.167 --> 36:45.068
You'll feel better.

36:45.070 --> 36:47.571
You'll feel happy.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.639
I can show you how.

36:52.143 --> 36:55.145
- No, thank you.

36:55.147 --> 36:58.215
- Do let me know
if you change your mind.

37:50.034 --> 37:51.968
- Eliot!

37:51.970 --> 37:54.537
The crown suits you, of course.

37:54.539 --> 37:56.806
- Who are all these people?
- The Pickwick family.

37:56.808 --> 37:59.008
They've been running things
till children of earth came.

38:02.213 --> 38:03.580
- Your highness.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.081
Tick Pickwick
of the northern marsh Pickwicks,

38:05.083 --> 38:06.683
at your service.

38:06.685 --> 38:08.818
The rest of the king's council
will arrive shortly.

38:08.820 --> 38:11.855
- Great.
- So glad you're here.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.823
There are a few problems.

38:13.825 --> 38:15.692
Uh, several problems

38:15.694 --> 38:17.327
that could use
your immediate attention.

38:17.329 --> 38:19.929
- Ah, okay, great.
- We should probably get started.

38:19.931 --> 38:22.232
- First, your throne room.

38:22.234 --> 38:23.900
I'm afraid it's been locked
a long time.

38:23.902 --> 38:25.535
- We're looking for the key.
- That's fine.

38:25.537 --> 38:28.605
Uh, take me straight to
the armory.

39:05.376 --> 39:10.113
- The armory,
your, uh, highnesses.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.315
- Well, this is underwhelming.

39:12.317 --> 39:15.385
- This is supposed to be
full of books.

39:18.289 --> 39:19.723
- "Strategies for trapping

39:19.725 --> 39:21.825
tomato-eating garden fairies."

39:21.827 --> 39:23.893
Yeah, no.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.729
- Someone took
all the battle magic.

39:25.731 --> 39:28.431
- It's not like the beast
is coming to find us any second.

39:28.433 --> 39:30.567
- Wait, this is something.

39:30.569 --> 39:33.636
It's an... it's a workbook
on spells, serious ones.

39:33.638 --> 39:35.572
Looks like battle magic.

39:35.574 --> 39:37.407
But the actual spells
aren't here.

39:37.409 --> 39:40.810
- Hmm, like notes on cake,
but no actual recipes.

39:40.812 --> 39:42.946
That's helpful.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.682
Who wrote it?

39:45.684 --> 39:47.917
- Oh, my god.
- What?

39:47.919 --> 39:49.986
- I know where we need to go.

39:52.356 --> 39:53.823
- Brakebills?

39:58.163 --> 40:02.365
- Hello?
- Mr., uh, Mr...

40:06.004 --> 40:09.406
Fuck!

40:09.408 --> 40:12.041
- Can I help you?

40:12.043 --> 40:14.010
- Hell, yes, you can.
- These don't work.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.578
- Well, by all means,
request a refund.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.914
- Very funny.
- You did this on purpose.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.884
- Did what? Help an ungrateful
child of earth?

40:20.886 --> 40:22.218
- Look, I'll pay you
whatever you want, okay?

40:22.220 --> 40:23.553
I'm... I'm serious, okay?

40:23.555 --> 40:24.888
I'm friends
with the kings and queens.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.790
You want to be a Duke,
great, I got you...

40:26.792 --> 40:29.292
- actions have consequences,
penny.

40:29.294 --> 40:32.228
Even glib words spoken
in casual arrogance.

40:32.230 --> 40:34.364
It's past time you learned,

40:34.366 --> 40:36.433
especially give the position
you'll occupy soon.

40:36.435 --> 40:37.767
- What position?

40:37.769 --> 40:39.602
- You know what?
- I've done you a service.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.471
- No, no, look, hey, I'm...

40:41.473 --> 40:44.307
I'm sorry, okay?

40:44.309 --> 40:47.544
Please fix my hands.

40:47.546 --> 40:50.647
- See, how do I put this
in a way that you'll understand?

40:50.649 --> 40:54.651
Ah, go fuck yourself.

40:54.653 --> 40:58.221
- No, wait!

40:58.223 --> 41:00.290
Fuck!

41:03.327 --> 41:06.095
- Hang onto this while I'm gone.

41:06.097 --> 41:08.798
- Oh.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.567
You guys all packed?

41:10.569 --> 41:14.304
- Yeah.

41:14.306 --> 41:17.273
El, thank you.

41:17.275 --> 41:19.909
- For what?
- For, um, taking one for the team

41:19.911 --> 41:21.978
to the tune
of the rest of my life?

41:23.948 --> 41:26.783
I'm trying
to see this ruling thing

41:26.785 --> 41:29.185
as an adventure.

41:29.187 --> 41:31.955
Apparently we have enemies
to the north and south.

41:31.957 --> 41:36.092
Plus broken infrastructure
and huge magic issues

41:36.094 --> 41:38.862
thanks to the beast
and his wellspring addiction.

41:38.864 --> 41:41.598
And do you know they don't know
what champagne is here?

41:43.334 --> 41:45.535
I plan on inventing it.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.370
I'd like to be known as...

41:47.372 --> 41:50.807
The champagne king.

41:50.809 --> 41:52.008
- It has a ring to it.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.710
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

41:53.712 --> 41:56.613
- I'm really looking forward
to drinking socially,

41:56.615 --> 41:58.681
like the French.

42:03.721 --> 42:07.457
So, uh, in the books,

42:07.459 --> 42:09.959
time doesn't exactly run
the same speed

42:09.961 --> 42:13.796
on earth as in Fillory.

42:13.798 --> 42:15.231
- I mean, look, sometimes
it got screwy

42:15.233 --> 42:18.067
when Jane and Martin
would go back and forth.

42:18.069 --> 42:20.136
- But not always.

42:22.306 --> 42:24.374
- It's gonna be fine.

42:26.310 --> 42:28.077
- Yeah.

42:28.079 --> 42:29.646
Yeah.

42:29.648 --> 42:32.382
Or I'll just live out my days

42:32.384 --> 42:35.451
waiting for my friends
to return and die alone.

42:42.826 --> 42:45.929
You know, it's considered
extremely disrespectful

42:45.931 --> 42:48.998
to touch a king
without permission.

42:51.402 --> 42:55.204
But, um, I think you should...

42:55.206 --> 42:58.274
Probably hug me right now.

43:07.718 --> 43:09.385
It'll also be okay if you just

43:09.387 --> 43:11.888
give my ass, like,
a little squeeze.

43:14.859 --> 43:19.228
- Feel free to, uh, double-check
this before I get started.

43:19.230 --> 43:21.297
Julia?

43:33.243 --> 43:36.212
- Why do you want to help me

43:36.214 --> 43:39.048
with my shade?

43:39.050 --> 43:40.650
- Without your shade,

43:40.652 --> 43:45.254
you would see
a lot of things differently.

43:45.256 --> 43:49.058
You'd be able to live, Julia.

43:49.060 --> 43:51.094
Come here.

43:51.096 --> 43:53.162
Let me show you.

44:25.462 --> 44:27.664
- We're there.
- Put it back.

44:27.666 --> 44:31.000
- It's okay, it's okay.

44:31.002 --> 44:34.103
- I need it.

44:34.105 --> 44:37.173
Put it back now, Martin.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.877
- Suit yourself.

45:00.397 --> 45:03.666
- I understand
why you're afraid.

45:03.668 --> 45:06.069
You don't want to lose yourself.

45:06.071 --> 45:08.371
But hear me on this.

45:08.373 --> 45:10.139
Martyring yourself to your pain

45:10.141 --> 45:11.741
isn't all it's advertised to be.

45:11.743 --> 45:14.811
It'll destroy you.

45:14.813 --> 45:18.081
There's no glory in that.

45:18.083 --> 45:21.918
You might get Reynard, yes.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.054
But he'll still win.

45:25.056 --> 45:27.056
Anyways.

45:28.305 --> 45:34.556
