00:03.834 --> 00:05.834
(buzz of excited chatter)

00:09.417 --> 00:10.667
(clears throat)

00:10.709 --> 00:11.792
Good evening, ladies,

00:11.834 --> 00:14.750
and welcome to the
official launch

00:14.792 --> 00:15.750
of "The None."

00:15.792 --> 00:17.875
(hoot and applaud)

00:18.917 --> 00:22.250
Please join me in welcoming
Katie Atkins.

00:22.291 --> 00:24.709
(applaud and cheer)

00:25.750 --> 00:26.917
Thank you.

00:26.959 --> 00:29.750
I am so excited to share
this book with you.

00:29.792 --> 00:31.792
We have lots of
surprises tonight,

00:31.834 --> 00:35.000
and it is all thanks to
my very talented friend

00:35.041 --> 00:36.375
and editor.

00:36.417 --> 00:38.667
She is the vision
behind this launch,

00:38.709 --> 00:41.417
so, thank you,
Erica Strange.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.333
(cheer and applaud)

00:43.375 --> 00:45.917
Erica: ever get that feeling
that you've hit your stride?

00:45.959 --> 00:48.625
You're in the groove,
on top of the world?

00:48.667 --> 00:52.792
Like everything you've worked
so hard for is finally yours?

00:52.834 --> 00:54.375
Katie: ...And Julianne
Giacomelli,

00:54.417 --> 00:56.417
and all of the people
at River Rock

00:56.458 --> 00:57.583
who poured their hearts...

00:57.625 --> 00:59.834
This launch would make
Deepak jealous,

00:59.875 --> 01:02.667
and those slogan T's
are the cutest!

01:02.709 --> 01:04.208
Incredible work,
chicken.

01:04.250 --> 01:05.333
Thank you, Julianne.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.291
So, without
further ado...

01:09.333 --> 01:11.375
Bachelors, come on out!

01:11.417 --> 01:14.750
(whoop and holler)

01:14.792 --> 01:17.583
Erica: oh boy! Welcome,
gentlemen.

01:17.625 --> 01:18.959
Welcome. Have fun.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.875
Julianne: My spidey
senses are saying,

01:20.917 --> 01:23.792
"New York Times bestseller,
here we come!"

01:23.834 --> 01:25.834
(excited laughter)

01:25.875 --> 01:26.875
Hi there.
Have fun.

01:29.709 --> 01:31.458
Can I get a whoo-hoo?!

01:31.500 --> 01:33.417
Can I get a
wha-wha?!

01:33.458 --> 01:34.667
Who's the man?

01:34.709 --> 01:36.291
That's me.
Oh, yeah.

01:37.750 --> 01:38.959
Someone had a good night.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.250
Oh, Ethan,
it was the best!

01:41.291 --> 01:42.917
(inhales, excited)

01:44.125 --> 01:45.250
all of that work,

01:45.291 --> 01:47.083
all those months of stress
finally pay off.

01:47.125 --> 01:48.709
The whole night,
it was perfect,

01:48.750 --> 01:50.000
from beginning to end.

01:50.041 --> 01:51.083
That's awesome.

01:51.125 --> 01:52.500
Wait here.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.500
Erica: where are
you going?

01:57.041 --> 01:57.875
Hmm?

01:57.917 --> 01:58.959
Ethan, what's this?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Open it.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.875
I know it's kind of
corny, but...

02:04.917 --> 02:06.291
No, I love it.

02:06.333 --> 02:07.291
You coming to bed?

02:07.333 --> 02:08.834
Um... In a minute.

02:08.875 --> 02:12.375
The first reviews should be
out online and...

02:12.417 --> 02:13.500
I can't wait.

02:15.834 --> 02:16.917
(clears throat)

02:19.917 --> 02:21.291
But that perfect moment,

02:21.333 --> 02:23.834
no matter how badly
we want it to,

02:23.875 --> 02:25.959
won't last forever.

02:27.417 --> 02:28.750
Oh my God.

02:28.792 --> 02:30.458
That good, huh?

02:31.625 --> 02:32.959
What does it say?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.041
"The None is definitely
not the one."

02:36.041 --> 02:37.875
Hey, it's just one
review, right?

02:37.917 --> 02:39.917
Yeah, one
terrible review.

02:39.959 --> 02:43.000
Ethan: from bookwormer.ca
Who cares about them?

02:43.041 --> 02:45.000
Come on, try not
to think about it.

02:45.041 --> 02:46.250
Let's just go to bed.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.291
Yeah, I'll be
right there.

02:50.709 --> 02:53.625
Because without warning,
a setback can strike...

02:53.667 --> 02:55.375
What?!

02:55.417 --> 02:57.875
Sending us even further back
than where we started from.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.959
Oh, great, and that's
from Larry Horowitz.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.375
Larry jerk-owitz.

03:49.417 --> 03:51.625
No, he's actually one
of the top literary critics

03:51.667 --> 03:52.792
in Toronto.

03:52.834 --> 03:54.667
It's just a couple of
people's opinions.

03:54.709 --> 03:56.083
Who reads reviews anyway?

03:56.125 --> 03:57.542
Everyone in the industry.

03:57.583 --> 03:59.291
I mean my bosses,

03:59.333 --> 04:00.500
the public.

04:00.542 --> 04:03.625
A review - it can make
or break a book.

04:03.667 --> 04:05.333
Ethan, this is
really bad.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.083
Hey, I guess my day
can't get any worse, right?

04:12.125 --> 04:13.375
Just hang in there,
okay?

04:14.208 --> 04:15.208
Yeah.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.500
(office phones ring)

04:33.959 --> 04:35.166
Julianne?

04:35.208 --> 04:36.208
Yes?

04:39.625 --> 04:41.917
So, the reviews were...

04:41.959 --> 04:43.458
Catastrophic?

04:43.792 --> 04:46.000
I just... I feel like
I should do something.

04:46.041 --> 04:47.750
Well, there's nothing
to be done.

04:47.792 --> 04:49.083
Although, personally,

04:49.125 --> 04:51.000
I'd like to give Larry Horowitz
a piece of my mind.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.000
Yeah, see? Okay, 'cause
I read the review

04:53.041 --> 04:55.041
and normally,
I agree with Larry, I do,

04:55.083 --> 04:57.333
but I feel like,
you know, he misunderstood

04:57.375 --> 04:58.834
what Katie was trying
to say.

04:58.875 --> 05:00.583
It's like his interpretation
of the message,

05:00.625 --> 05:02.125
it was way off.

05:02.166 --> 05:04.333
Okay, Erica, I get that you
wanna cry and share feelings-

05:04.375 --> 05:05.583
No, it's not just that.

05:05.625 --> 05:07.583
It's just I honestly feel
that the review,

05:07.625 --> 05:09.041
it wasn't fair.

05:09.333 --> 05:10.291
All right, chicken,

05:10.333 --> 05:12.709
let's get some
perspective here.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.166
If the book sells,

05:14.208 --> 05:15.709
no one's gonna remember
the reviews.

05:16.583 --> 05:17.166
Really?

05:17.208 --> 05:18.834
Yeah.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.834
So... Scoot!

05:22.166 --> 05:22.709
Erica.

05:22.750 --> 05:23.709
Yeah?

05:23.750 --> 05:25.250
Don't "dwell."

05:25.291 --> 05:27.208
Focus on
the sex scoop.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.291
Cry in the bathroom,
move on.

05:29.333 --> 05:30.792
Frank Galvin
will be back today

05:30.834 --> 05:32.542
and we've gotta be
on our game,

05:32.583 --> 05:33.583
you got it?

05:34.041 --> 05:35.041
'kay. Thanks.

05:38.542 --> 05:39.542
Move on.

05:39.583 --> 05:41.291
(computer keys clack)

05:41.333 --> 05:43.166
(office phones ring)

05:48.834 --> 05:50.166
(paper rustles)

05:55.250 --> 05:57.458
(through gritted teeth)
you didn't even read it!

06:02.959 --> 06:04.041
(phones ring)

06:12.875 --> 06:13.959
(zipper zips)

06:16.417 --> 06:17.875
Brent: Thanks
for coming in,

06:17.917 --> 06:20.208
but we're looking for something
a little more relatable,

06:20.250 --> 06:23.458
given our recent...
Colossal failure.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.917
Uh...

06:28.959 --> 06:30.041
Thanks.

06:35.917 --> 06:36.500
(hard thud)

06:36.542 --> 06:37.333
Ow!

06:39.458 --> 06:41.125
Sorry, I just, uh...

06:41.166 --> 06:44.542
I just got another
rejection.

06:44.583 --> 06:45.542
Sorry to hear that.

06:45.583 --> 06:47.417
Yeah, by number nine,
you...

06:47.458 --> 06:49.083
Well, you almost stop
feeling it.

06:49.125 --> 06:51.583
Well, you know, Brent,

06:51.625 --> 06:53.125
he can be pretty tough.

06:53.166 --> 06:54.500
Are you a...

06:54.542 --> 06:56.041
Are you an editor too?

06:56.083 --> 06:58.041
Uh, I like to think so.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.875
Well, in that case,
Seth Newman.

06:59.917 --> 07:00.834
Hi, Erica Strange.

07:00.875 --> 07:02.250
It's nice to meet
you, Erica.

07:02.291 --> 07:04.208
Nice to meet you, too.

07:07.709 --> 07:09.542
So what is "The Purple
Door" about?

07:09.583 --> 07:11.291
It's the story
of my life.

07:12.667 --> 07:15.000
Wow. So you were
raised in a cult

07:15.041 --> 07:16.500
and your parents,
they're still there.

07:16.542 --> 07:17.750
And now?

07:17.792 --> 07:19.417
Well, I got out.

07:19.458 --> 07:20.959
I'm one of the lucky ones.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.792
But I had to um... Escape,

07:23.834 --> 07:25.583
and I haven't looked
back since.

07:25.625 --> 07:27.041
Until now.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.250
Seth, that must
be so hard.

07:30.291 --> 07:31.250
It's an amazing story.

07:31.291 --> 07:32.500
I mean, if you want,

07:32.542 --> 07:34.500
I'd be happy
to give it a read.

07:34.542 --> 07:36.250
I can't promise anything,
of course, but...

07:36.291 --> 07:38.875
No, of course not.
Um...

07:38.917 --> 07:42.875
You have no idea how much
I appreciate this, Erica.

07:42.917 --> 07:44.291
Great.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.291
Um... I'll be in touch.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.458
Take care.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.291
Yeah. Thank you.

07:50.333 --> 07:51.709
(traffic whirs by)

07:53.250 --> 07:54.291
This is a first.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.291
What do you have
in there, a gun?

07:56.333 --> 07:57.291
Oh, of course not.

07:57.333 --> 07:58.667
Just checking.

07:58.709 --> 08:01.125
An editor comes to see me
the day I give a bad review,

08:01.166 --> 08:01.917
it's a little...

08:01.959 --> 08:02.667
Unorthodox?

08:02.709 --> 08:03.542
That's one word.

08:03.583 --> 08:04.667
Crazy's another.

08:04.709 --> 08:06.125
What can I do for you,
Miss Strange,

08:06.166 --> 08:07.375
that I haven't already done?

08:07.417 --> 08:09.125
Well, I've read your
review, of course,

08:09.166 --> 08:10.625
and I have to be honest,

08:10.667 --> 08:11.625
I think you've
misinterpreted

08:11.667 --> 08:13.375
what Katie Atkins
was trying to say.

08:13.417 --> 08:14.458
Really?

08:14.500 --> 08:16.250
Yeah. I mean, the book,
it's sending out

08:16.291 --> 08:17.083
an optimistic message,

08:17.125 --> 08:18.917
it's about finding happiness.

08:18.959 --> 08:20.417
With a guy
you don't love.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.333
Happiness through
mediocrity,

08:21.375 --> 08:22.917
through settling.

08:22.959 --> 08:24.208
Well, I'm sorry,
Mr. Horowitz,

08:24.250 --> 08:26.417
but I think that settling
is a little simplistic.

08:26.458 --> 08:29.208
I mean, we're just saying stop
holding out for Mr. Right.

08:29.250 --> 08:30.583
And settle for Mr. Wrong.

08:30.625 --> 08:32.000
Not Mr. Wrong,
mr. Real.

08:32.041 --> 08:34.583
Now that's a worthy idea,
but it's not in the book.

08:34.625 --> 08:36.333
It's the whole backbone
of the book.

08:36.375 --> 08:38.875
No, the backbone of the book
is the cynical flipside

08:38.917 --> 08:41.333
that all men
are fixer-uppers;

08:41.375 --> 08:45.000
that you never hoped
to find your soulmate.

08:45.041 --> 08:46.250
Well, that wasn't
the intention.

08:46.291 --> 08:47.542
What is it you want?

08:47.583 --> 08:49.875
A new review?
A retraction?

08:50.750 --> 08:52.542
I just...
I just wanna understand.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.375
Fine. Now you understand.

08:54.417 --> 08:56.583
This book made me angry.

08:56.625 --> 08:58.291
It's a manual
on giving up,

08:58.333 --> 09:00.834
and how to stop
looking for love.

09:00.875 --> 09:03.583
You know, I've been married
to my soulmate for 20 years,

09:03.625 --> 09:06.333
I can assure you, I did
not marry "The None."

09:08.834 --> 09:11.750
I'm assuming
we're done here?

09:15.375 --> 09:16.041
(exhales)

09:19.166 --> 09:20.041
Travis: Okay, so...

09:20.083 --> 09:21.291
Remember when you told us

09:21.333 --> 09:22.792
that the band shouldn't
enter V-Fest?

09:22.834 --> 09:24.792
How you said
it would be a waste,

09:24.834 --> 09:26.291
that we were still
too raw?

09:26.333 --> 09:27.375
Yeah, I remember.

09:27.417 --> 09:29.375
Before you freak out,
I want you to know

09:29.417 --> 09:31.375
that there's a happy ending
to this story

09:31.417 --> 09:33.333
because, bro...

09:34.750 --> 09:36.041
We got in.

09:37.166 --> 09:38.375
It's not the main stage,

09:38.417 --> 09:40.709
but there will be key
industry people there

09:40.750 --> 09:41.709
to hear us play.

09:41.750 --> 09:42.792
No.

09:42.834 --> 09:43.458
Kai...

09:43.500 --> 09:46.125
We're not doing this.

09:46.166 --> 09:47.333
Yeah, we are.

09:47.375 --> 09:49.917
Travis, trust me,
this is not what we need.

09:49.959 --> 09:51.000
You said yourself

09:51.041 --> 09:53.000
that you wanted
to keep the band small.

09:53.041 --> 09:54.959
When did I ever
say that?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.417
We're doing this, Kai.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.291
Dr. Fred: you know,
Travis has a point.

10:03.333 --> 10:06.333
He doesn't say, "let's
keep the band small"

10:06.375 --> 10:08.542
until june 18th, 2012.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.125
You're a couple
years early.

10:11.166 --> 10:12.875
He may not
know it now.

10:12.917 --> 10:14.417
Dr. Fred:
but you do.

10:14.458 --> 10:17.041
Because hindsight's 20-20?

10:17.083 --> 10:18.041
That's right.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.458
Not always.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.875
Travis has big dreams too.

10:22.750 --> 10:23.959
But he couldn't
handle them.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.250
That may be true,
but that's not the point.

10:28.417 --> 10:29.917
Your future,

10:29.959 --> 10:33.041
you know, the very thing
you keep fighting against?

10:33.083 --> 10:36.333
Well, it looks like
it's found you.

10:42.458 --> 10:43.875
(elevator dings)

10:46.875 --> 10:49.542
Um, Brent, a
quick word.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.417
Yes, Julianne.

10:52.417 --> 10:54.125
Well, I was reviewing
the latest chapters

10:54.166 --> 10:55.458
of "The Mystery Of Tomorrow,"

10:55.500 --> 10:59.125
and, I gotta say,
not exactly up to snuff.

11:01.417 --> 11:03.458
Friedken and I actually
feel very strongly

11:03.500 --> 11:05.417
about the chapters.

11:05.458 --> 11:09.583
Well, I feel very strongly
that they need work.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.583
Care to be specific?

11:11.625 --> 11:14.083
I will be "specific"
when I give you your notes.

11:14.125 --> 11:15.583
And I don't like
your tone.

11:15.625 --> 11:17.125
And I don't trust
your "instincts"

11:17.166 --> 11:18.875
because lately, they've
been about as reliable

11:18.917 --> 11:21.792
as a Bernie Madoff
stock tip.

11:21.834 --> 11:24.542
Brent, I am your boss.

11:24.583 --> 11:27.500
That's what your
business cards say.

11:27.542 --> 11:30.333
The chapters remain
as they are.

11:30.375 --> 11:31.834
Brent, what is
wrong with you?

11:31.875 --> 11:33.333
This is none
of your business.

11:33.375 --> 11:35.125
Look, she gave you
your shot, okay?

11:35.166 --> 11:36.333
If it wasn't for Julianne

11:36.375 --> 11:38.125
you would still be
in the mailroom

11:38.166 --> 11:39.375
working with Zeke.

11:39.417 --> 11:41.667
Please, please, could
we all just calm down,

11:41.709 --> 11:42.750
remain professional?

11:42.792 --> 11:44.000
Julianne: professional?!

11:44.041 --> 11:46.000
Is that what you call
going behind my back

11:46.041 --> 11:46.959
to Frank Galvin?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.709
I was looking out
for River Rock.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.375
You were looking out
for "numero uno"

11:51.417 --> 11:53.542
and Frank is either
too naive

11:53.583 --> 11:55.291
or in the early stages
of Alzheimer's,

11:55.333 --> 11:56.333
not to see that.

11:56.375 --> 11:57.375
Julianne.

11:59.250 --> 12:00.875
Erica.

12:00.917 --> 12:02.375
Boardroom.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.792
Now.

12:08.166 --> 12:13.917
(stunned breaths)

12:13.959 --> 12:14.959
Um, Frank...

12:16.250 --> 12:17.667
Ugh... God.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.208
Engaging in a public
shouting match

12:22.250 --> 12:23.583
with a fellow employee?

12:23.625 --> 12:24.875
Frank, I'm sorry.

12:24.917 --> 12:26.875
That's what I keep hearing,
apology after apology.

12:26.917 --> 12:29.125
And yet I come back
to find your department,

12:29.166 --> 12:30.875
once again, in shambles.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.417
Case in point,

12:32.458 --> 12:34.875
Erica visiting Larry
Horowitz at his office,

12:34.917 --> 12:35.917
accosting him.

12:35.959 --> 12:37.000
What?!

12:37.041 --> 12:39.542
I-I... I just wanted
some clarification.

12:39.583 --> 12:42.625
You went to see him?
Erica, we don't do that.

12:42.667 --> 12:44.667
I'm sorry, I...
I just thought-

12:44.709 --> 12:46.875
No, you didn't think!

12:47.458 --> 12:48.667
Neither did you,

12:48.709 --> 12:50.417
dropping the ball
on "The None."

12:50.458 --> 12:52.959
Giving a junior editor
free reigns.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Crossing the line
with Thomas Friedken,

12:55.041 --> 12:56.583
a bestseller.

12:56.625 --> 12:57.750
Frank.

12:57.792 --> 13:00.250
You managed to talk me
into the Sex Scoop,

13:00.291 --> 13:04.542
based largely on the projected
success of "The None."

13:04.583 --> 13:05.750
(book slams on desk)

13:05.792 --> 13:08.000
it now seems only logical
to kill that title.

13:08.041 --> 13:09.250
Mr. Galvin, if I may.

13:09.291 --> 13:10.750
"The Sex Scoop"
and "The None,"

13:10.792 --> 13:11.792
they're completely different.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.834
Who the hell do you
think you are?!

13:14.709 --> 13:16.208
Julianne,

13:16.250 --> 13:19.125
you brought us great success
with Thomas Friedken.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.542
Based on that,

13:20.583 --> 13:23.291
I was prepared to overlook
a few stumbles,

13:23.333 --> 13:26.125
but we've reached the point
where your errors in judgment

13:26.166 --> 13:29.333
are now compromising the
reputation of this company.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.375
I cannot stand by
and let that happen.

13:31.417 --> 13:32.750
Frank, please.

13:32.792 --> 13:36.667
You will pack up your desks
and be out before lunch.

13:36.709 --> 13:37.709
Both of you.

13:43.834 --> 13:45.750
(door opens and closes)

13:53.500 --> 13:54.709
(van whirs by)

13:56.208 --> 13:57.875
Hey...

13:57.917 --> 13:59.041
It's gonna be okay.

13:59.083 --> 14:00.750
No, Ethan, it's not.

14:00.792 --> 14:03.875
I got fired again.

14:03.917 --> 14:05.625
This is story of
my life, right?

14:05.667 --> 14:06.792
(shaky, ragged breath)

14:06.834 --> 14:08.750
you'll find another job,
you always do.

14:08.792 --> 14:10.417
Mm.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.667
Oh, that's great.
In what?

14:11.709 --> 14:13.875
Um... Customer service?

14:13.917 --> 14:14.875
Maybe telemarketing?

14:14.917 --> 14:15.959
Hey...

14:16.041 --> 14:17.083
You're gonna bounce back.

14:17.125 --> 14:19.083
I know it might not
seem like it,

14:19.125 --> 14:20.834
but this could be
an opportunity.

14:20.875 --> 14:23.125
To collect welfare?

14:23.166 --> 14:24.875
You've always wanted
to work in fiction.

14:24.917 --> 14:27.417
Now's your chance to apply
to those kinds of jobs.

14:27.458 --> 14:30.333
Ethan, you don't realize
how small the industry is.

14:30.375 --> 14:31.750
Everyone reads the reviews.

14:31.792 --> 14:33.500
No one's gonna hire
me after this.

14:33.542 --> 14:37.125
Of course they will
and I'll help you.

14:38.542 --> 14:39.500
What are you doing?

14:39.542 --> 14:40.500
Let's update your CV!

14:40.542 --> 14:42.000
The best thing
you can do

14:42.041 --> 14:44.125
is just get right back
in the game.

14:44.166 --> 14:45.709
(laptop snaps shut)

14:45.750 --> 14:49.709
I know that you're just trying
to make me feel better, but...

14:50.709 --> 14:53.542
But honestly, all I wanna do
is just crawl into bed

14:53.583 --> 14:54.792
and disappear.

14:57.709 --> 15:01.667
"A refreshing take on love
that tells it like it is."

15:01.709 --> 15:03.041
That's not bad.

15:03.083 --> 15:04.625
Oh, yeah?

15:04.667 --> 15:05.667
Okay, so, uh...

15:06.917 --> 15:09.417
Why don't you go tell that
to Larry Horowitz.

15:09.458 --> 15:10.625
(disgusted huff)

15:10.667 --> 15:12.917
enh, what does it
matter anyways?

15:12.959 --> 15:13.959
I got fired.

15:15.834 --> 15:17.792
Why does it have
to be so hard?

15:17.834 --> 15:20.583
And what would make
things better, hmm?

15:20.625 --> 15:23.542
Vacation?
A good book?

15:23.583 --> 15:25.125
Some perspective maybe?

15:25.166 --> 15:26.792
A lottery ticket?

15:26.834 --> 15:28.000
Ah, money.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.542
Interesting.

15:31.583 --> 15:35.291
And so what do you think
that that would solve for you?

15:35.333 --> 15:36.959
Buy a little happiness,
maybe?

15:37.000 --> 15:38.500
No, it's not about
buying anything;

15:38.542 --> 15:41.208
it's about...
It's about freedom.

15:43.542 --> 15:44.667
(sighs)

15:44.709 --> 15:46.917
which brings us
to your list.

15:47.917 --> 15:50.333
You wanna take a stab?
Got any guesses here?

15:50.375 --> 15:51.959
"meandyoumakestwo.com."

15:52.000 --> 15:54.083
(chuckles)
Well done.

15:54.125 --> 15:55.667
So what happened there?

15:55.709 --> 15:58.458
Oh, it was a dot-com company
that I worked for in the boom

15:58.500 --> 16:02.083
and I quit a few months
before they were bought out.

16:02.125 --> 16:04.625
And that was the lottery ticket
that I threw away.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.875
Ah...

16:07.917 --> 16:09.291
It's pointless anyways
though.

16:09.333 --> 16:10.542
It's like you told me,

16:10.583 --> 16:12.542
you can't go back
to win a lottery.

16:12.583 --> 16:16.458
Mm, no, I said you can't
go back and buy a ticket.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.625
This is different.
This is a legitimate regret.

16:19.667 --> 16:22.041
So, go ahead,
indulge me.

16:24.625 --> 16:26.041
I...

16:29.083 --> 16:30.834
If I would've stayed,
I would've been...

16:30.875 --> 16:32.792
I would've been rich
in my twenties.

16:32.834 --> 16:34.333
(half laughs)

16:35.166 --> 16:36.500
I...

16:36.542 --> 16:38.792
I mean, I could've paid off
all my student loans,

16:38.834 --> 16:42.083
and I never would've had
to work at a call centre.

16:42.125 --> 16:44.083
I would've had the time
and the means

16:44.125 --> 16:46.959
to dedicate to my writing.

16:48.125 --> 16:51.000
And my life, it would've been
completely different.

16:51.041 --> 16:53.291
(water rushes,
Erica exhales)

16:59.083 --> 17:00.083
What?

17:02.542 --> 17:03.542
Ah...

17:04.959 --> 17:06.625
So, I made us reservations

17:06.667 --> 17:09.000
for tomorrow night
at Canoe.

17:09.750 --> 17:11.041
Right.

17:11.083 --> 17:12.208
Hey, come on,

17:12.250 --> 17:14.208
I had to call in
some serious favours

17:14.250 --> 17:15.792
to get a last-minute table.

17:15.834 --> 17:18.500
A little "thanks, Luc"
would be good.

17:18.542 --> 17:19.834
Luc...

17:19.875 --> 17:20.583
Yeah?

17:20.625 --> 17:23.041
um... (stammers)
thanks.

17:24.041 --> 17:25.041
Anytime.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.125
Uh...

17:31.875 --> 17:35.417
("Clocks" by Coldplay plays)

17:36.834 --> 17:37.834
(shocked gasp)

17:45.166 --> 17:47.000
(exhales, awestruck)

17:54.208 --> 17:56.000
(exhales in amazement)

17:58.000 --> 18:00.917
Hey, I've got a 2:00 today
at Goldman Sachs,

18:00.959 --> 18:02.583
but call me after
your meeting,

18:02.625 --> 18:04.834
I wanna hear all about it.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.041
Um, my meeting...

18:07.083 --> 18:10.458
At River Rock,
about your book.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.583
My book?

18:11.625 --> 18:14.041
Okay, so it's not
a book yet,

18:14.083 --> 18:16.166
but I believe in you.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Your paper.

18:20.959 --> 18:22.125
My paper.

18:22.166 --> 18:23.834
My, my paper!

18:23.875 --> 18:27.083
My... Which I'm
going to read

18:27.125 --> 18:29.917
with my coffee.
(titters)

18:29.959 --> 18:30.959
you okay, babe?

18:31.000 --> 18:32.792
Yeah, I'm fine.
Mm-hm.

18:36.208 --> 18:36.834
Bye.

18:36.875 --> 18:37.792
Bye.

18:39.917 --> 18:40.917
See ya.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.917
(excited squeal)

18:49.959 --> 18:52.291
(screaming)
whaaa-ha-ha-ha!

19:01.166 --> 19:02.542
(doorbell dings)

19:02.583 --> 19:03.834
Stay there.

19:06.208 --> 19:07.208
Coming!

19:10.250 --> 19:13.125
Dr. Tom: Ms. Strange?
Christmas comes early,

19:13.166 --> 19:16.166
courtesy of the 2004
fall collection.

19:17.083 --> 19:19.250
Erica: 2004? Wait,
wait, wait...

19:19.291 --> 19:22.583
I worked at "meandyoumakestwo"
in 2001.

19:22.625 --> 19:24.333
Yeah-yeah-yeah, well,
you didn't quit,

19:24.375 --> 19:26.542
it's three years later,
options vested,

19:26.583 --> 19:28.709
you made millions,
yada-yada-yada.

19:29.834 --> 19:32.583
Ooh, can anybody say
"fierce"?

19:32.625 --> 19:34.083
Oh, so...

19:34.125 --> 19:35.458
You're my personal shopper?

19:35.500 --> 19:37.000
Well, I prefer
personal stylist.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.500
Oh.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.417
This is for your
meeting today.

19:40.458 --> 19:43.333
Right, at River Rock,
for my book,

19:43.375 --> 19:44.333
that I write here

19:44.375 --> 19:45.959
in my big,
fancy-shmancy mansion

19:46.000 --> 19:49.083
that I bought
with my millions.

19:49.125 --> 19:50.917
Dr. Tom,

19:50.959 --> 19:54.250
I own a first edition
of "Ulysses."

19:55.250 --> 19:56.250
(impressed whistle)

19:56.291 --> 19:57.750
right here.

19:57.792 --> 19:59.000
First edition.

20:00.875 --> 20:03.333
Oh my God, I wonder
if James Joyce signed it?

20:03.375 --> 20:08.166
I rather think that you'd
want to focus on this.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.166
"Little Feats?"

20:10.208 --> 20:12.792
This is my short story
from professor Lozar's class.

20:12.834 --> 20:14.041
Hm. You say short story,

20:14.083 --> 20:17.250
I say first chapter
of your first novel.

20:17.291 --> 20:19.750
Look, you've already
started to expand it.

20:19.792 --> 20:22.083
And I snagged a meeting
at River Rock?

20:22.125 --> 20:23.083
Oh, why, because I'm...

20:23.125 --> 20:24.375
In good company.

20:24.417 --> 20:26.500
Turns out that you frequent
the same private club

20:26.542 --> 20:29.667
as Frank Galvin's daughter.

20:29.709 --> 20:31.667
"Success is often achieved

20:31.709 --> 20:36.125
by those who don't know
that failure is inevitable."

20:37.333 --> 20:38.333
Coco Chanel.

20:39.667 --> 20:40.667
Thanks!

20:46.458 --> 20:47.959
(elevator dings)

20:48.000 --> 20:50.792
(hum of chatter
throughout office)

21:02.959 --> 21:05.208
So, it's the story
about a girl

21:05.250 --> 21:06.583
from rural Ontario

21:06.625 --> 21:08.959
who suffers hardship
after hardship

21:09.000 --> 21:10.667
and she's in love...

21:10.709 --> 21:12.875
And I know
you're thinking hardship,

21:12.917 --> 21:14.041
rural Ontario,

21:14.083 --> 21:15.250
not the sexiest world,

21:15.291 --> 21:17.542
but it's a story that
has been important to me

21:17.583 --> 21:18.792
since university.

21:18.834 --> 21:21.125
You know, I really connect
with the protagonist.

21:21.166 --> 21:23.208
She's, she's an underdog.

21:23.250 --> 21:24.709
Erica...

21:24.750 --> 21:27.917
I was born just after
the great depression.

21:27.959 --> 21:29.500
I had seven siblings.

21:29.542 --> 21:30.709
I know.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.583
I built this company
from nothing.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.083
I have lived
through poverty.

21:35.125 --> 21:36.208
Whereas you?

21:36.250 --> 21:39.166
You became wealthy overnight.

21:39.208 --> 21:40.375
That's true, but-

21:40.417 --> 21:43.667
you've heard the saying,
"write what you know?"

21:43.709 --> 21:46.375
Authenticity is everything.

21:47.458 --> 21:50.667
H-how could you possibly
know anything

21:50.709 --> 21:52.125
about your protagonist?

21:52.166 --> 21:53.625
Uh...

21:53.667 --> 21:57.959
Okay, I could make
the character more urban.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.083
That's a start.

22:00.625 --> 22:02.208
Tell you what.

22:03.834 --> 22:05.667
Let's start
from scratch here.

22:07.166 --> 22:08.375
Mr. Galvin-

22:08.417 --> 22:11.125
stop trying to be
the next Margaret Atwood.

22:11.166 --> 22:13.250
Be what you are!

22:13.291 --> 22:15.125
Write the next
"Devil Wears Prada,"

22:15.166 --> 22:17.125
or "Shopaholic" book.

22:17.166 --> 22:19.500
Write what you know.

22:19.542 --> 22:22.291
That's the best advice
that I can give you.

22:22.333 --> 22:23.667
Oh...

22:23.709 --> 22:24.625
(clears throat)

22:24.667 --> 22:27.250
Right, well, thank
you, Mr. Galvin.

22:27.291 --> 22:28.291
Good luck.

22:28.333 --> 22:29.333
Thank you.

22:43.166 --> 22:49.250
(cell phone ringing)

22:49.291 --> 22:50.291
Uh...?

22:52.041 --> 22:52.917
(beeps phone on)

22:52.959 --> 22:53.834
Hello?

22:53.875 --> 22:55.333
Woman: Where
are you?

22:55.375 --> 22:57.458
Uh, sorry,
who is this?

22:57.500 --> 22:59.333
Woman: (half laughs)
it's Shayna.

22:59.375 --> 23:01.208
Did you forget our shiatsus?

23:01.250 --> 23:03.500
No, I did-
no, of course not.

23:03.542 --> 23:06.291
Can you just remind me again,
where are we meeting?

23:06.333 --> 23:07.667
(relaxed groans)

23:10.291 --> 23:12.875
Wow, I could get
used to this.

23:12.917 --> 23:14.333
Mm, yeah, I know.

23:14.375 --> 23:17.125
Once a week
really isn't enough.

23:17.166 --> 23:18.959
So, listen,
you coming tonight or what?

23:19.000 --> 23:20.834
I need to know.

23:20.875 --> 23:22.750
Oh, remind me?

23:22.792 --> 23:24.834
Hello? The Noam
Chomsky lecture.

23:24.875 --> 23:26.333
He's talking about
his new book,

23:26.375 --> 23:29.291
all about American imperialism,
post 9-11.

23:29.333 --> 23:30.500
That sounds amazing!

23:30.542 --> 23:32.250
So what? We get
to meet him?

23:32.291 --> 23:36.083
(titters) meet him,
have drinks with him.

23:36.125 --> 23:37.291
So, here's
the plan.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.959
Yeah.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.208
Shayna: I'm gonna pick up Jenny
and Tassie in my new wheels

23:41.250 --> 23:43.250
and then we'll swing around
and get you,

23:43.291 --> 23:46.250
and you'll spend the night
finding me a future husband.

23:46.291 --> 23:47.625
Perfect! And what
about Judith?

23:47.667 --> 23:50.375
'cause Noam Chomsky,
he's right up her alley.

23:50.417 --> 23:51.000
Judith?

23:51.041 --> 23:51.709
Erica: Yeah.

23:51.750 --> 23:53.166
Do you guys even talk?

23:53.208 --> 23:55.500
Seriously, that girl
is so jealous of you.

23:55.542 --> 23:57.750
I mean if you wanna
invite her, invite her,

23:57.792 --> 24:00.125
but I'm not
picking her up.

24:04.208 --> 24:06.458
(streetcar rumbles and dings)

24:07.500 --> 24:08.500
(exhales)

24:12.458 --> 24:14.375
Hey, Jude.
Thank you.

24:14.667 --> 24:15.625
Thank you for coming.

24:15.667 --> 24:18.375
So what's the big emergency?

24:18.417 --> 24:20.333
Oh, well, uh...

24:21.375 --> 24:24.000
(stammers)
um, I just...

24:25.000 --> 24:28.667
I wanna know why
we don't talk anymore.

24:34.583 --> 24:36.250
Please, Jude, tell me,

24:36.291 --> 24:39.375
why did you stop
talking to me?

24:39.709 --> 24:41.417
Come on, why are
you doing this?

24:41.458 --> 24:43.959
Because I know that
you will tell me the truth.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.709
So, just lay it
on me, Jude.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.500
I'm serious, don't hold
anything back.

24:52.583 --> 24:53.583
Fine.

24:55.875 --> 24:58.583
You used to be ambitious.

24:58.625 --> 25:00.083
You wanted to be
an author,

25:00.125 --> 25:02.458
you wanted to win
a booker.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.583
But ever since you...

25:04.625 --> 25:07.709
Ever since you cashed in,
all you do is shop,

25:07.750 --> 25:09.709
or travel, or...

25:09.750 --> 25:11.375
Go to parties
and...

25:11.417 --> 25:14.333
Lectures
and silent auctions.

25:15.875 --> 25:18.542
You don't even try
anymore.

25:20.875 --> 25:21.875
Okay.

25:23.667 --> 25:25.250
And you and I?

25:26.583 --> 25:29.750
It's not like I don't
love you, Erica,

25:29.792 --> 25:31.417
I do, I just...

25:31.458 --> 25:35.125
I mean we were best
friends for years.

25:37.041 --> 25:40.291
We're just in
different places now.

25:45.250 --> 25:46.959
I have to go to
work, so...

25:47.000 --> 25:49.125
Sure. Of course.

25:49.166 --> 25:50.458
And thank you.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.667
Yeah. Um...

25:52.709 --> 25:54.500
Erica, for the record?

25:55.500 --> 25:58.000
You stopped calling me.

26:11.291 --> 26:13.834
Hey, I thought you were
going to Chomsky?

26:13.875 --> 26:16.000
I... (sighs) I
cancelled.

26:16.041 --> 26:17.417
You did, why?

26:17.458 --> 26:19.500
I ended up meeting up
with Judith.

26:19.542 --> 26:22.000
We got together
for coffee.

26:22.041 --> 26:25.417
Judith? Well,
that must've been fun.

26:28.500 --> 26:31.458
Look, I take it the
meeting at River Rock

26:31.500 --> 26:32.875
didn't go so well?

26:32.917 --> 26:34.125
(sighs deeply)

26:36.166 --> 26:38.083
Luc, what do I do?

26:38.125 --> 26:39.041
About Judith?

26:39.083 --> 26:41.667
No, I mean, day
after day. I...

26:41.709 --> 26:42.917
I don't have a job,

26:42.959 --> 26:46.291
I go for massages
with Shayna and...

26:46.333 --> 26:47.208
And then what?

26:47.250 --> 26:48.792
Just sit around
and eat bon bons

26:48.834 --> 26:50.792
and talk about
politics all day?

26:50.834 --> 26:52.458
Erica, you're writing
a book, right?

26:52.500 --> 26:53.709
Ugh.

26:53.750 --> 26:55.208
Luc: River Rock -

26:55.250 --> 26:57.041
who needs them?

26:57.083 --> 26:58.125
Self-publish.

26:58.166 --> 26:59.166
Luc.

26:59.208 --> 27:00.500
I'm serious.

27:00.542 --> 27:03.041
Look, you don't need to go
in there on your knees

27:03.083 --> 27:05.208
begging to be taken
seriously.

27:05.250 --> 27:08.166
Publish your own book.

27:08.208 --> 27:10.291
Buy a publishing company.

27:10.333 --> 27:12.667
Oh, so it's that
easy, huh?

27:13.709 --> 27:17.208
If I can't do it myself
then I just buy it?

27:18.792 --> 27:21.875
Who says money
can't buy happiness?

27:21.917 --> 27:22.959
(phones ring)

27:23.000 --> 27:24.083
(gasps)

27:24.125 --> 27:25.041
Woman: Hello?

27:25.083 --> 27:25.792
Hello?

27:25.834 --> 27:26.875
Woman: Hello!

27:26.917 --> 27:30.166
Say, "WTP Insurance,
how may I help you"?

27:30.208 --> 27:31.667
Say it.

27:31.709 --> 27:32.709
(stunned exhale)

27:36.750 --> 27:38.458
WTP Insurance,
how may I help you?

27:38.500 --> 27:40.250
(dial tone)

27:40.291 --> 27:41.875
Vair?

27:41.917 --> 27:44.542
Okay, I'm sorry,
am I going too fast?

27:44.583 --> 27:45.792
Is that it?

27:45.834 --> 27:47.667
Uh, this is a telephone.

27:47.709 --> 27:50.250
We use these in 2009
to transmit

27:50.291 --> 27:51.458
and receive sound.

27:51.500 --> 27:54.750
Most commonly the human
voice, I.E. Yours.

27:54.792 --> 27:57.542
Do you... Are you
understanding me?

27:57.583 --> 27:58.792
How is this happening?

27:58.834 --> 28:00.750
Yeah, actually,
it kind of isn't,

28:00.792 --> 28:04.291
okay? Since someone put
the "you" in incom-petent.

28:04.333 --> 28:05.792
Vair, I just need
a second-

28:05.834 --> 28:06.875
tea time!

28:06.917 --> 28:09.041
Don't talk,
don't answer the phone,

28:09.083 --> 28:10.083
Don't move.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.333
Perfect.

28:12.917 --> 28:13.917
(stunned gasp)

28:16.875 --> 28:18.709
(office phones ring)

28:22.291 --> 28:23.959
Hello. Um, WTP.

28:24.959 --> 28:26.542
Dr. Tom: Hello, Erica.

28:26.583 --> 28:28.750
(whispers)
Dr. Tom?!

28:28.792 --> 28:30.250
Where are you?

28:30.291 --> 28:31.291
Huh?

28:33.792 --> 28:35.291
(whispers)
Dr. Tom?

28:41.333 --> 28:42.792
What the hell is going on?

28:42.834 --> 28:45.750
Well, I think Vair made
that pretty clear.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.083
You're in training.

28:47.125 --> 28:49.542
What am I doing at WTP
in 2009?

28:49.583 --> 28:52.208
Because I don't work
at WTP in 2009.

28:52.250 --> 28:53.667
Well, you do now.

28:53.709 --> 28:55.083
(stammers, stunned)

28:56.291 --> 28:58.709
oh, come on, you
lived the good life,

28:58.750 --> 29:00.625
you know, for a while,

29:00.667 --> 29:02.542
but then, hey,
the well ran dry.

29:02.583 --> 29:05.041
I don't think it helped
having Luc as your boyfriend

29:05.083 --> 29:07.166
and your financial advisor.

29:07.208 --> 29:08.917
Apparently, he was
terrible at both,

29:08.959 --> 29:10.583
but anyway,
there you have it.

29:10.625 --> 29:12.542
'kay, wait a minute,
wait-wait-wait.

29:12.583 --> 29:14.125
What're you saying?

29:15.125 --> 29:17.875
I'm saying that it's gone.

29:17.917 --> 29:18.917
All of it.

29:20.208 --> 29:23.500
And with nothing
to fall back on...

29:23.542 --> 29:25.208
WTP?! I mean...

29:26.792 --> 29:28.834
What about my book?

29:28.875 --> 29:30.125
What about "Little Feats"?

29:30.166 --> 29:31.834
Uh...

29:31.875 --> 29:34.250
Well, little came of it.

29:34.291 --> 29:35.500
You and Luc broke up

29:35.542 --> 29:37.291
and rather than working
on the book,

29:37.333 --> 29:41.083
you decided that you wanted
to get away from it all

29:41.125 --> 29:43.083
and you went on
a safari

29:43.125 --> 29:46.250
to... Tanzania,
I believe.

29:46.291 --> 29:49.709
And you saw lots of
lions and a...

29:49.750 --> 29:51.834
Giraffe or two and...

29:51.875 --> 29:53.000
Monkeys.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.750
Okay, wait a minute,
so, I didn't...

29:55.792 --> 29:57.792
I didn't finish the book

29:57.834 --> 29:59.458
and now I have nothing?

29:59.500 --> 30:01.625
No, you still got
your mom.

30:01.667 --> 30:02.917
You live with her now.

30:02.959 --> 30:03.959
What?!

30:04.834 --> 30:06.875
Dr. Tom:
well...

30:08.208 --> 30:10.667
We don't wanna
keep Vair waiting.

30:10.709 --> 30:12.000
W-wait.

30:12.041 --> 30:13.542
(stammering)
wait... I mean...

30:13.583 --> 30:15.792
You're gonna send
me back, right,

30:15.834 --> 30:17.250
to the real 2009?

30:17.291 --> 30:20.959
Well, who said that
this isn't real?

30:21.000 --> 30:22.208
(welling up)
Dr. Tom.

30:22.250 --> 30:23.834
Go on.

30:23.875 --> 30:25.959
Go on, Erica, and
enjoy the first day

30:26.000 --> 30:28.083
of the rest of your life.

30:28.125 --> 30:29.125
No way!

30:31.041 --> 30:32.959
I'm not going anywhere.

30:34.750 --> 30:35.750
(exhales)

30:43.291 --> 30:45.875
Oh, hey, Erica,
where were you?

30:45.917 --> 30:48.875
I, uh, just had to use
the, um...

30:48.917 --> 30:50.542
Washroom? Okay,
that's pretty funny,

30:50.583 --> 30:54.000
'cause the rest of us
have to wait 42 more minutes,

30:54.041 --> 30:56.875
'cause that's when the scheduled
bathroom break is.

30:56.917 --> 30:58.750
Okay, Vair, just,
just back off.

30:58.792 --> 31:02.000
Wow, wow, that's a little
hostility, huh?

31:02.041 --> 31:04.375
No one really likes
an Amy attitude.

31:04.417 --> 31:05.583
Would you please just-

31:05.625 --> 31:06.750
hold on,

31:06.792 --> 31:08.083
getting a little signal.

31:08.125 --> 31:11.041
(vair mimics beeping radar)

31:13.041 --> 31:14.792
this just in.

31:15.750 --> 31:18.417
(snaps fingers)
good stuff.

31:22.625 --> 31:23.625
(gasps)

31:24.875 --> 31:27.250
I got fired by
sticky note.

31:27.291 --> 31:29.375
That's worse than being
let go by email.

31:29.417 --> 31:31.125
Oh, it's gonna
be fine, honey,

31:31.166 --> 31:32.583
you'll find something else.

31:32.625 --> 31:33.709
Oh yeah, maybe...

31:33.750 --> 31:36.417
Maybe another call
center job.

31:36.458 --> 31:37.875
You know, oh, hey,

31:37.917 --> 31:40.917
maybe I could go work for
uncle ruby at White Dreams?

31:40.959 --> 31:42.875
Erica, when you
hit a bump,

31:42.917 --> 31:46.959
you pick yourself up
and you keep going.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.208
Mom, this isn't a bump;

31:48.250 --> 31:50.333
it is a giant wall.

31:51.667 --> 31:53.125
I mean, is this my life?

31:53.166 --> 31:55.041
Do I just need to accept

31:55.083 --> 31:58.125
that this is as good
as it gets?

31:58.166 --> 32:00.041
You know,
you yourself said

32:00.083 --> 32:01.875
you didn't even
want this job.

32:01.917 --> 32:04.166
Ugh. You know what?
Mom, you don't get it.

32:04.208 --> 32:06.542
No, actually,
I do get it.

32:06.583 --> 32:08.834
Losing your job
is one thing, Erica,

32:08.875 --> 32:10.542
losing your son

32:10.583 --> 32:14.000
and then your marriage
is another.

32:15.041 --> 32:16.250
I'm not trying
to diminish

32:16.291 --> 32:18.041
what you're going through
here, Erica, but-

32:18.083 --> 32:20.291
no, mom, you're right.

32:20.333 --> 32:21.417
I'm wallowing.

32:21.458 --> 32:23.458
(shocked half laugh)

32:24.542 --> 32:27.000
you know, when your father
and I first got together,

32:27.041 --> 32:30.125
it felt like I could see
our entire future,

32:30.166 --> 32:34.083
complete with three
healthy, happy kids.

32:35.166 --> 32:36.750
But things don't
always turn out

32:36.792 --> 32:38.208
the way you imagine.

32:38.250 --> 32:40.625
Life deals you a hand

32:40.667 --> 32:42.959
and no matter what card
you're holding,

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
you have to play them.

32:45.041 --> 32:47.250
And, honey, it's hard,

32:47.291 --> 32:50.625
and it never
stops being hard.

32:50.667 --> 32:52.000
But you learn,

32:52.041 --> 32:54.417
and you change,
and you grow.

32:55.417 --> 32:58.583
And even in my darkest
moments, Erica,

32:58.625 --> 33:01.125
I remind myself...

33:01.166 --> 33:03.625
It's the reason
we're all here.

33:03.667 --> 33:05.625
So you got fired.

33:05.667 --> 33:09.208
So you're back down
at the bottom again.

33:10.250 --> 33:12.083
It could be worse.

33:12.125 --> 33:13.125
Yeah.

33:15.125 --> 33:16.709
So get back up

33:17.333 --> 33:19.333
and keep fighting!

33:28.959 --> 33:30.041
(elevator dings)

33:31.041 --> 33:32.041
(phones ring)

33:48.750 --> 33:50.291
Hello.

33:50.333 --> 33:53.083
My name is Erica Strange.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.667
Do you have an appointment?

33:57.709 --> 33:59.834
No, I don't,
but I was...

33:59.875 --> 34:03.709
Hoping to talk to you
about working...

34:04.834 --> 34:05.667
Here.

34:05.709 --> 34:07.417
I love books.

34:07.458 --> 34:09.667
and I feel that
I have what it takes

34:09.709 --> 34:12.542
to work with authors,
and to develop projects.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.166
Mm-hm.

34:14.208 --> 34:16.667
And I know that my CV
doesn't reflect that, but-

34:16.709 --> 34:17.917
All it really reflects

34:17.959 --> 34:21.458
is that you have a
masters in English lit...

34:21.500 --> 34:22.542
From ten years ago.

34:22.583 --> 34:25.917
It's nine years,
but point taken.

34:27.583 --> 34:28.959
Look, (sighing)

34:29.000 --> 34:30.834
I have a soft spot
for go-getters,

34:30.875 --> 34:32.083
but let's all
gather around

34:32.125 --> 34:35.542
and have a little
reality check.

34:35.583 --> 34:37.834
You have no experience.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.333
Then hire me
in the mail room.

34:45.375 --> 34:48.333
Honey, mail sorters
don't wear Prada.

34:48.375 --> 34:50.458
I bet you did.

34:50.500 --> 34:54.125
Secret number 34:
dress to impress, right?

34:54.166 --> 34:56.125
And I can promise you

34:56.166 --> 35:00.375
that I will not stay
a mail sorter for long.

35:02.959 --> 35:04.542
Is your phone number
on here?

35:04.583 --> 35:06.166
Home and cell.

35:08.166 --> 35:10.250
I'll see what I
can do.

35:11.250 --> 35:12.583
(clears throat)

35:15.083 --> 35:16.458
Thank you,
Mr. Kennedy.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.667
You're welcome,
Miss Strange.

35:23.333 --> 35:24.750
(elevator dings)

35:33.375 --> 35:34.375
(exhales)

35:37.000 --> 35:38.625
(relieved sigh)

35:49.417 --> 35:50.750
(printer whirs)

35:55.667 --> 35:56.625
Ethan: You're
up early.

35:56.667 --> 35:59.041
Well, I had to get
my CV ready.

35:59.083 --> 36:00.291
Plus, rustle up a list

36:00.333 --> 36:01.875
of every publishing
company in town.

36:02.875 --> 36:07.667
Wow, what a difference
a night's sleep makes, huh?

36:07.709 --> 36:09.750
You were right.

36:09.792 --> 36:10.959
I usually am.

36:15.583 --> 36:16.583
Good luck.

36:16.625 --> 36:17.750
Thanks.

Okay. Are you
ready?

37:29.792 --> 37:30.875
What is that?

37:30.917 --> 37:32.250
A manuscript,

37:32.291 --> 37:34.333
and it's amazing.

37:34.375 --> 37:36.083
I mean it needs
some work, but...

37:36.125 --> 37:37.375
Julianne,
it is so different

37:37.417 --> 37:39.834
from anything
that I've ever read.

37:39.875 --> 37:41.917
In case you
forgot, Erica,

37:41.959 --> 37:44.709
we're unemployed,
we are pariahs...

37:44.750 --> 37:46.834
'Kay, just hear me out.

37:46.875 --> 37:49.208
What if we publish it?

37:50.208 --> 37:53.583
Okay, someone needs to share
her anti-depressants.

37:53.625 --> 37:55.542
No, Julianne,
I'm serious.

37:55.583 --> 37:58.792
Let's start a company.
Together.

38:01.166 --> 38:02.792
Erica,

38:02.834 --> 38:04.917
starting a company,
that's a big deal.

38:04.959 --> 38:06.917
It's not like setting up
a lemonade stand.

38:06.959 --> 38:07.917
Okay, you know what?

38:07.959 --> 38:09.625
Stop being such
a Debbie downer.

38:09.667 --> 38:11.875
When did you ever give up
without a fight?

38:11.917 --> 38:13.875
I mean, you made a mistake
with Friedken

38:13.917 --> 38:15.625
and I screwed up
on "The None."

38:15.667 --> 38:17.583
And we got fired.

38:17.625 --> 38:18.959
And it's a setback.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.291
But it's also an opportunity
to try something.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.291
Maybe...

38:24.333 --> 38:27.750
This is the universe's way
of giving us a push.

38:31.375 --> 38:32.834
When the lord
closes a door,

38:32.875 --> 38:35.625
somewhere he
opens a window.

38:35.667 --> 38:37.625
It's mother superior.

38:37.667 --> 38:39.875
"sound of music."
I heart that movie.

38:39.917 --> 38:41.125
Exactly.

38:43.291 --> 38:45.542
Okay, I'll read it.

38:45.583 --> 38:46.792
Tonight.

38:47.166 --> 38:49.375
But I can't guarantee you
I'm gonna like it.

38:49.417 --> 38:51.000
You're gonna love it.

38:51.041 --> 38:52.750
Julianne, I...

38:52.792 --> 38:55.458
I have that tingly feeling.

38:58.417 --> 39:02.000
(music plays within goblins,
low hum of chatter)

39:05.792 --> 39:06.542
You stalking me?

39:06.583 --> 39:07.917
Yeah, Kai,

39:07.959 --> 39:11.667
I'm stalking the lead singer
of a nonexistent band.

39:11.709 --> 39:13.208
I know I've been
acting weird.

39:13.250 --> 39:14.291
You've been acting

39:14.333 --> 39:16.750
like a completely
different person.

39:16.792 --> 39:18.166
A few months ago,

39:18.208 --> 39:20.500
you were talking about "Head"
becoming the new U2.

39:20.542 --> 39:23.917
I know, but, Travis,
success isn't everything.

39:23.959 --> 39:26.208
If we do this,
if we go to V-Fest,

39:26.250 --> 39:28.250
there's a chance
we could blow up.

39:29.792 --> 39:31.959
Is that really
what you want?

39:32.000 --> 39:33.166
Of course.

39:33.208 --> 39:35.291
That's the whole point.

39:35.333 --> 39:37.250
Go big or go home.

39:38.667 --> 39:41.208
We can't do this
without you,

39:41.250 --> 39:44.291
so don't back out
on us now.

39:52.750 --> 39:55.750
You are not gonna
regret this.

39:58.166 --> 39:59.375
(elated breath)

39:59.417 --> 40:02.000
see you at
practice, okay?

40:09.417 --> 40:11.375
I don't wanna hear it.

40:11.417 --> 40:12.667
Okay, then.

40:14.166 --> 40:17.709
I'll just say that I think
you handled that really well.

40:17.750 --> 40:19.625
It's not how I
remember it.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.125
I thought I was the one-

40:21.166 --> 40:23.041
you thought
you pushed him into it.

40:23.083 --> 40:24.041
Yeah.

40:24.083 --> 40:26.792
You thought everything
you did

40:26.834 --> 40:28.250
lead to Travis' suicide.

40:28.291 --> 40:29.291
Yeah.

40:30.583 --> 40:32.291
Looks like the way
you remember things,

40:32.333 --> 40:36.333
isn't exactly
how they really happened.

40:37.333 --> 40:40.291
Something to think
about, Kai.

40:40.333 --> 40:41.834
Take it easy.

40:44.750 --> 40:46.333
Hey, Dr. Fred?

40:47.792 --> 40:48.792
Thanks.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.208
Happy to be back?

41:01.250 --> 41:02.875
Oh...

41:02.917 --> 41:04.417
You have no idea.

41:05.709 --> 41:08.208
So, winning the lottery?

41:08.250 --> 41:11.250
Is not all it's cracked
up to be.

41:11.291 --> 41:13.208
Well, it did gave you
that freedom

41:13.250 --> 41:14.291
you were talking about.

41:14.333 --> 41:15.709
Yeah,
freedom to coast

41:15.750 --> 41:18.041
and freedom
to stop trying.

41:18.083 --> 41:19.291
I mean, having it easy,

41:19.333 --> 41:21.583
it did solve some
problems, I guess,

41:21.625 --> 41:24.083
but then it created
a whole bunch of new ones.

41:24.125 --> 41:25.417
For example?

41:25.458 --> 41:26.458
All those hard years,

41:26.500 --> 41:30.250
all that struggle
to find my way,

41:30.291 --> 41:32.125
it made me different.

41:33.166 --> 41:34.750
It made me better.

41:35.750 --> 41:38.834
Where would we be
without struggle,

41:38.875 --> 41:42.041
without hardship
and pain?

41:42.083 --> 41:45.375
You know, it's easy to forget
how much these moments teach

41:45.417 --> 41:47.166
and shape us.

41:47.875 --> 41:51.542
How different we would be
without them.

41:52.542 --> 41:55.500
I guess, it's hard to look
at a setback as a gift.

41:55.542 --> 41:59.291
Why? When that's exactly
what it is.

41:59.333 --> 42:02.500
"The struggle itself
towards the heights

42:02.542 --> 42:05.125
is enough to fill
a man's heart."

42:05.166 --> 42:06.166
Albert Camus.

42:10.875 --> 42:12.208
Erica: setbacks.

42:12.250 --> 42:14.333
We face them every day.

42:14.375 --> 42:16.458
Some cause us to stumble,

42:16.500 --> 42:18.500
others brings us
to our knees.

42:18.542 --> 42:20.375
And along with pain
and heartache,

42:20.417 --> 42:23.709
each setback brings
the opportunity to rise up,

42:23.750 --> 42:25.333
to be stronger and better

42:25.375 --> 42:26.959
and braver than before.

42:27.000 --> 42:27.917
Hey.

42:27.959 --> 42:28.959
Hey!

42:30.750 --> 42:32.709
Are we celebrating
something?

42:32.750 --> 42:33.750
We are.

42:35.875 --> 42:38.083
You got a new job,
already?

42:38.125 --> 42:41.041
It's... It's more of
a new direction, actually.

42:41.083 --> 42:43.041
Here, have a seat
and let me explain.

42:43.083 --> 42:44.083
(stool rattles)

42:45.375 --> 42:46.375
So...

42:47.834 --> 42:51.166
What if Julianne and I started
our own publishing company?

42:51.208 --> 42:52.792
I know it's crazy,
right?

42:52.834 --> 42:54.750
But, I mean,
think about it.

42:54.792 --> 42:56.458
Was this Julianne's idea?

42:56.500 --> 42:58.208
No, it was mine,
actually.

42:58.250 --> 43:00.458
I read an incredible manuscript
by this new author.

43:00.500 --> 43:03.125
His writing blew
me away.

43:04.125 --> 43:05.834
Okay, what's wrong?

43:06.834 --> 43:09.500
Erica, starting your own
publishing company,

43:09.542 --> 43:11.000
it's a risky move.

43:11.041 --> 43:13.250
It's not something
you just decide on a whim.

43:13.291 --> 43:14.375
No, and I'm not.

43:14.417 --> 43:16.500
I'm gonna have to take out
a business loan,

43:16.542 --> 43:18.542
the hours are gonna be
crazy at first-

43:18.583 --> 43:22.750
You've never run a business,
it might not work out.

43:22.792 --> 43:25.250
Why are you being
so negative?

43:25.291 --> 43:26.959
I'm not being negative

43:27.041 --> 43:29.291
and I don't mean
to sound like a jerk.

43:29.333 --> 43:32.458
I just think we should
be practical.

43:32.500 --> 43:36.583
I'm sorry, I just don't
think it's a good idea.

43:36.625 --> 43:39.333
Erica: But no sooner have we
conquered a setback,

43:39.375 --> 43:40.959
we'll find another

43:41.000 --> 43:43.875
just waiting
to take its place.
