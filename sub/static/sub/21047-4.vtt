<i>Previously on "Blood Drive"...</i>

00:04.501 --> 00:06.101
- Jesus.
- They're shooting red now.

00:06.103 --> 00:07.803
- You can't shoot the stuff.
- Doesn't work that way.

00:07.805 --> 00:09.435
Ahh!

00:09.600 --> 00:11.360
Heart Enterprises
owns the asylum

00:11.369 --> 00:12.706
where your sister is living.

00:12.707 --> 00:14.573
That's not a random connection.

00:15.840 --> 00:16.900
What do you want from me?

00:16.907 --> 00:18.842
Obedience.

00:19.023 --> 00:20.653
I need you to get
these bombs off our necks.

00:20.658 --> 00:22.625
They'll blow us both up
if we try.

00:22.626 --> 00:24.026
What about that box
that slink carries around,

00:24.028 --> 00:25.028
can you mess with that?

00:25.029 --> 00:26.896
<i>Yeah, in theory.</i>

00:26.897 --> 00:29.335
The race takes us
within 30 miles of that asylum.

00:29.336 --> 00:30.893
You up for a detour, Barbie?

00:30.901 --> 00:32.000
Hell yeah.

<i>In the middle
of a hard day's work...</i>

01:01.932 --> 01:04.932
<i>Everybody needs
a little pick-me-up.</i>

01:47.411 --> 01:49.411
<i>Smax candy.</i>

01:49.413 --> 01:53.143
<i>So good, you'd kill
for just one more taste.</i>

01:53.150 --> 01:57.150
<i>A scary night is Halloween.</i>

01:57.154 --> 01:59.922
<i>Ghouls and goblins
make me scream.</i>

01:59.923 --> 02:01.183
<i>The horror and the mayhem...</i>

02:01.191 --> 02:02.821
Good morning, everyone.

02:02.826 --> 02:04.961
Happy Halloween.

02:04.962 --> 02:07.862
<i>There's something scary
for everyone...</i>

02:48.772 --> 02:50.772
A few hours, tops.

02:50.774 --> 02:52.774
Nobody ever ditches
the mayhem party.

02:52.776 --> 02:55.016
Just gotta make sure
we're back for the race.

02:58.214 --> 03:00.814
I think this is the first time
I've ever seen you happy.

03:00.818 --> 03:02.218
How could I not be?

03:02.219 --> 03:04.787
Finally getting my sister back.

03:04.788 --> 03:05.922
And then what?

03:05.923 --> 03:08.491
She gonna finish the race
with us?

03:08.492 --> 03:10.092
I don't know.

03:10.094 --> 03:12.762
I haven't thought
that far ahead, okay?

03:12.763 --> 03:14.124
But we can't remove
these brain bombs,

03:14.131 --> 03:17.261
and I still need the prize money
to take care of her.

03:17.267 --> 03:19.205
Oh, but don't you
even think of putting

03:19.206 --> 03:21.503
that conspiracy theory shit
inside her head.

03:21.505 --> 03:24.474
I wanna bring down heart,
but people are more important.

03:24.475 --> 03:26.975
I promise, Karma comes first.

03:30.180 --> 03:31.940
Of course,
none of that really matters

03:31.949 --> 03:33.787
if our heads are gonna explode.

03:33.788 --> 03:35.884
Well, I guess there's
only one way to figure out

03:35.886 --> 03:37.756
if The Scholar lied to us.

03:47.931 --> 03:50.791
Hold still,
or it won't hurt enough.

03:50.801 --> 03:52.331
Ahh...

04:04.948 --> 04:06.948
Hand me that, you imbecile.

04:06.950 --> 04:08.510
I guess if you want
something done right,

04:08.519 --> 04:11.989
you've got to do it yourself.

04:23.567 --> 04:26.237
You sneaky little bastards.

04:28.838 --> 04:31.038
Always biting the hand
that feeds you.

04:39.816 --> 04:42.351
Ahh...

04:42.352 --> 04:44.982
TouchÃ©, officer Bailey.

04:44.988 --> 04:46.388
Where's rib bone?

04:46.390 --> 04:48.150
And before you say
you don't know, be advised,

04:48.158 --> 04:52.295
I'll use that drill
on your urethra.

04:52.296 --> 04:54.296
I don't know.

04:58.035 --> 04:59.605
Get that to The Scholar.

04:59.606 --> 05:02.003
He'll know what to do with it.

05:20.022 --> 05:22.922
- Cool.
- We're not dead yet.

05:22.926 --> 05:25.264
I'm sure slink knows
we've left by now.

05:25.265 --> 05:27.922
Heart Enterprises is already
harvesting homeless people

05:27.931 --> 05:29.331
for their blood.

05:29.333 --> 05:31.193
What could they want
with a mental hospital?

05:31.201 --> 05:33.961
I don't know; that's why
we gotta make this quick.

05:33.971 --> 05:35.232
Grace,
we're just signing her out.

05:35.239 --> 05:37.406
It's paperwork.

05:37.407 --> 05:39.207
You catch more flies
with sugar, you know?

05:39.209 --> 05:41.077
Whatever Heart Enterprises
wants with her,

05:41.078 --> 05:43.148
they're not gonna let her go
that easy, and you know it.

05:43.149 --> 05:44.413
Which is why it'll go smoother

05:44.414 --> 05:45.944
if we let my friends here
do the talking.

05:45.949 --> 05:47.449
You asked for my help.

05:47.451 --> 05:50.281
Do me the courtesy
of trying it my way, please.

05:51.954 --> 05:53.354
Fine.

05:53.357 --> 05:56.125
Okay.

05:56.126 --> 05:59.262
But it's honey, not sugar.

05:59.263 --> 06:01.223
Dipshit.

06:11.675 --> 06:16.045
- Welcome to Kane Hill.
- Happy Halloween.

06:16.046 --> 06:18.916
You know it's June, right?

06:22.319 --> 06:25.226
Uh, I'm officer Bailey,
and this is my partner...

06:25.227 --> 06:28.052
I'm here to find
my sister, Karma d'argento.

06:29.458 --> 06:31.968
You can call Dr. Kleinfeld
if there's a problem...

06:31.969 --> 06:34.362
she was transferred.

06:34.364 --> 06:36.094
Okay, you didn't
even check to see if...

06:36.099 --> 06:38.199
she was transferred.

06:38.201 --> 06:39.461
Are you fucking kidding me?

06:39.469 --> 06:41.109
Put down
the goddamn candy bar...

06:41.110 --> 06:43.372
- Easy, Grace.
- Sorry, sir.

06:43.373 --> 06:45.503
Can you call Dr. Kleinfeld?

06:45.509 --> 06:47.443
I can draw you a map.

06:47.444 --> 06:49.344
That sounds great.

06:49.346 --> 06:51.946
That works.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.380
- Okay, that's it!
- Okay, easy, easy, Grace!

06:59.389 --> 07:01.489
Your blood sugar's tanking.

07:01.491 --> 07:03.351
Uh, I think it's time
we get her a muffin.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.120
Uh, we'll take it from here.

07:05.128 --> 07:06.728
Thanks so much for your help.

07:06.730 --> 07:09.060
If you could just buzz us in,
that'd be perfecto.

07:13.437 --> 07:18.074
Your best friend, the cop,
has taken a few liberties.

07:18.075 --> 07:20.375
If you're still up
for a little revenge,

07:20.377 --> 07:23.277
I'll Grant you a free pass
to go after them.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.040
I've been wanting to get back
at that pig for a while.

07:27.050 --> 07:28.410
Just the cop.

07:28.418 --> 07:31.728
The girl I want alive.

07:35.425 --> 07:38.094
He's a dead man.

07:38.095 --> 07:41.464
Uh, one condition.

07:41.465 --> 07:43.265
Caligula gets her own masseuse.

07:43.266 --> 07:45.166
She's a little stressed.

08:01.183 --> 08:03.183
This squiggle
means right or left?

08:03.186 --> 08:04.455
Just forget about the map.

08:04.456 --> 08:06.354
Something's off
about this place.

08:06.356 --> 08:08.756
- It's an asylum.
- What'd you expect?

08:08.759 --> 08:10.759
Something's different.

08:16.099 --> 08:20.239
- No, no, no!
- Help me, help me, help me!

08:23.240 --> 08:24.800
How big is this place?

08:24.808 --> 08:27.278
Big enough that
we should split up.

08:27.279 --> 08:29.277
Good idea.

08:55.372 --> 08:57.502
Must have been some dream.

09:05.281 --> 09:07.511
So why am I still restrained?

09:07.517 --> 09:09.417
While we have you,
we need a few...

09:09.419 --> 09:10.819
Samples.

09:14.291 --> 09:16.291
Samples for what?

09:18.161 --> 09:21.561
Your bodily fluids tell us
the story of who you are.

09:21.565 --> 09:24.195
We'll need to harvest them,

09:24.201 --> 09:26.601
all of them,

09:26.603 --> 09:31.173
should we ever want to
reproduce your best features.

09:32.876 --> 09:35.516
If that's all you want,
all you gotta do is ask, baby.

09:37.414 --> 09:39.414
That's why I like you,
Christopher.

09:41.318 --> 09:44.888
Always looking
for the silver lining.

09:54.297 --> 09:56.497
Hey, have you seen
Dr. Kleinfeld?

09:58.635 --> 10:00.635
Kleinfeld?

10:27.464 --> 10:29.594
Well, this place is weird.

10:29.599 --> 10:31.367
Just play it cool, okay?

10:31.368 --> 10:32.638
How long are we gonna be here?

10:32.639 --> 10:34.266
Not long.

10:34.271 --> 10:36.231
What if Lucas calls?

10:36.239 --> 10:37.377
Then you call him back.

10:37.378 --> 10:38.374
Straightaway?

10:38.375 --> 10:39.375
Tomorrow.

10:39.376 --> 10:40.606
He's so sweet.

10:40.610 --> 10:42.210
- Of course he is.
- His name is Lucas.

11:09.739 --> 11:11.639
Don't look at me
like that, Karma.

11:11.641 --> 11:13.541
Look, this place
is dripping in silicone.

11:13.543 --> 11:16.273
It's the only way I'm gonna
get the primo to notice me.

11:16.279 --> 11:17.748
You're better than that.

11:17.749 --> 11:20.247
Yeah, and we're too broke
for me to act like it.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.410
I hear the pit crew makes bank.

11:22.419 --> 11:25.289
Enough cash where maybe
you could go back to school.

11:25.290 --> 11:27.428
That would be nice,
but it's bullshit.

11:27.429 --> 11:29.754
I mean, a race across America?

11:29.759 --> 11:32.261
No one can afford the gas.

11:32.262 --> 11:34.392
I don't know, but I gotta try.

11:34.397 --> 11:36.437
Payday's too big to pass up.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.340
What kind of name
is primo anyway?

11:45.342 --> 11:46.972
Primo's not his name.

11:46.977 --> 11:49.317
It's the title
of the winner, and...

11:49.318 --> 11:51.712
I think it's kind of awesome.

11:51.715 --> 11:53.015
Look...

11:53.016 --> 11:54.483
I can tell you hate this.

11:54.484 --> 11:55.754
Why don't you just
go wait in the car?

11:55.755 --> 11:58.382
No, I'm fine.

11:58.388 --> 12:01.257
I'll play along.

12:01.258 --> 12:02.524
Thanks.

12:02.525 --> 12:04.593
One beer, no drugs,

12:04.594 --> 12:05.724
especially not red.

12:05.729 --> 12:07.669
Got it.

12:17.439 --> 12:18.579
<i>Okay, now you've gotta be</i>

12:18.580 --> 12:20.705
a big brave little dog

12:20.710 --> 12:22.840
while daddy goes in there,
and...

12:22.846 --> 12:26.846
Cuts up some bacon
for your breakfast.

12:26.850 --> 12:29.350
Give me some sugar.

12:37.494 --> 12:39.494
Happy Halloween.

12:45.402 --> 12:47.432
Your candy bowl's empty.

13:03.353 --> 13:05.753
So tell me...

13:05.755 --> 13:08.895
How long you crazy fucks
been running this place?

13:25.475 --> 13:26.905
Yes...

13:29.540 --> 13:31.840
Oh, come on, seriously?

13:41.851 --> 13:43.481
Are you real?

13:43.487 --> 13:45.747
Of course I'm real.

13:45.756 --> 13:48.086
- Thank the baby Jesus!
- A cop!

13:48.092 --> 13:50.592
They didn't attack you
dressed like this?

13:50.594 --> 13:53.863
No, we walked right in.

13:53.864 --> 13:55.464
What the hell happened here?

13:55.466 --> 13:56.726
Good morning, everyone.

13:56.733 --> 13:58.573
Happy Halloween!

13:59.802 --> 14:02.271
The patients rioted
on Halloween.

14:02.272 --> 14:03.742
They took over
the whole damn place.

14:03.743 --> 14:05.170
It was anarchy.

14:05.175 --> 14:07.213
And... and now
we're the prisoners.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.741
Well, there has to be
someone in charge.

14:13.484 --> 14:16.184
<i>Here, piggy-piggy-piggy.</i>

14:16.186 --> 14:17.616
How does it feel to be locked in

14:17.621 --> 14:19.791
with violent psychopaths?

14:26.596 --> 14:31.196
<i>And the only way
out of this place...</i>

14:31.201 --> 14:34.701
<i>Is through me!</i>

14:36.639 --> 14:38.769
Shit. They hate it when
the emergency lights come on.

14:38.775 --> 14:40.245
It makes them violent.

14:40.246 --> 14:41.781
- Okay, no, no.
- Stay with me.

14:41.782 --> 14:43.908
I'm a cop.
It's much safer with me, okay?

14:43.914 --> 14:45.914
Yeah, until they kill you.

14:45.916 --> 14:47.876
Okay, let's look at
the bright side...

14:47.885 --> 14:50.355
- do you have any food?
- I haven't eaten in days.

14:50.356 --> 14:53.794
No, but if you help me
find my friend, I promise,

14:53.795 --> 14:57.690
next roadside diner we find,
apple pie's on me.

14:57.694 --> 14:59.194
No meat, though.

14:59.196 --> 15:01.326
Pie? Deal.

15:01.331 --> 15:04.200
But you won't make it 10 feet
dressed like that.

15:04.201 --> 15:05.631
I'll be the judge of that.

15:11.909 --> 15:13.369
So if we're gonna survive...

15:13.377 --> 15:15.877
You're gonna have to go native.

15:15.879 --> 15:18.209
Dr. Kleinfeld?

16:05.696 --> 16:07.326
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

16:07.331 --> 16:08.961
- Uh...
- Nowhere with you.

16:08.966 --> 16:10.656
Hey, wait,
we could have so much fun.

16:10.667 --> 16:11.997
- Just...
- No. Just stop.

16:12.002 --> 16:13.602
Oh, I think you know
what I need.

16:13.604 --> 16:15.604
- Stop.
- Get away from me.

16:15.606 --> 16:17.606
She said no, cocksucker.

16:21.345 --> 16:22.612
Are you okay?

16:22.613 --> 16:24.613
No, I'm not.

16:28.785 --> 16:29.985
Can we please just go home now?

16:29.987 --> 16:31.747
Oh, come on,
primo isn't even here.

16:31.755 --> 16:32.895
It's my one chance to meet him.

16:32.896 --> 16:34.389
Just give me
a couple more hours.

16:34.391 --> 16:35.821
That's what you said
two hours ago.

16:42.699 --> 16:44.969
Damn it, I'm trying to
make sure we get ahead, Karma.

16:44.970 --> 16:47.428
By what? Fucking some guy
you don't even know?

16:47.437 --> 16:49.337
Who says I'm gonna fuck him?

16:49.339 --> 16:51.039
- I'm your sister.
- I know you.

16:51.041 --> 16:53.641
You'd do anything
to get what you want.

16:53.644 --> 16:55.044
I love you and shit,
but sometimes

16:55.045 --> 16:57.680
being your guardian sucks.

16:57.681 --> 17:00.711
I'm sorry
I'm such a burden to you.

17:00.717 --> 17:02.847
Karma, you know
that's not what I meant.

17:02.853 --> 17:04.453
Why should you have all the fun?

17:04.454 --> 17:06.354
- Karma?
- Karma, stop!

17:06.356 --> 17:08.016
Karma!

17:50.033 --> 17:52.533
- Hey, sniff your own ass!
- He's mine!

17:58.709 --> 18:00.109
You do crazy pretty well.

18:01.445 --> 18:03.115
You look good.

18:07.718 --> 18:10.978
Just keep walking.

18:10.987 --> 18:12.887
They killed another one.

18:12.889 --> 18:14.389
Another what?

18:14.391 --> 18:15.791
Wait.
That wasn't paint?

18:15.792 --> 18:17.522
This is where the riot
came to a head.

18:17.527 --> 18:19.427
God-awful slaughtering.

18:19.429 --> 18:22.559
They sacrifice another employee
every week in remembrance.

18:22.566 --> 18:24.396
Well, there was
only two patients in there.

18:24.401 --> 18:26.001
- I can take them.
- And if the other patients

18:26.002 --> 18:27.472
come running, we're both dead.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.001
You can't do anything for them.

18:29.005 --> 18:31.474
They're beyond help,
but I'm not.

18:31.475 --> 18:33.909
Come on.

18:33.910 --> 18:35.910
Oh, my god.

18:45.122 --> 18:47.452
Anne, help me.

18:47.457 --> 18:50.087
Anne! Anne!

18:50.093 --> 18:52.027
Will you stop? You're gonna
get us both killed.

18:52.028 --> 18:54.158
When was the last time
these patients took their meds?

18:54.164 --> 18:56.504
This place hasn't been
an actual hospital in years.

18:56.505 --> 18:57.900
What do you mean?

18:57.901 --> 18:59.501
Shh!

19:06.543 --> 19:08.543
When the government
cut mental health funding,

19:08.545 --> 19:10.445
we needed money,
and Heart Enterprises

19:10.447 --> 19:11.877
needed lab rats.

19:11.882 --> 19:12.912
Lab rats for what?

19:12.916 --> 19:14.006
Bad monkey!

19:24.027 --> 19:25.487
Candy?

19:25.495 --> 19:27.035
- Not just candy...
- What's in the candy.

19:27.036 --> 19:28.930
Heart wanted to reengineer sugar

19:28.932 --> 19:30.962
so it wouldn't make people fat,
which smax doesn't.

19:30.967 --> 19:33.967
- Only problem is, it...
- it makes people insane.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.049
So smax is basically like a...

19:47.050 --> 19:49.618
Like an edible form of red?

19:49.619 --> 19:51.919
Not even close.

19:51.922 --> 19:55.060
Red makes you feel euphoric,
like you're in the womb, but...

19:55.061 --> 19:57.188
Smax makes you feel
like a hunter.

20:00.197 --> 20:02.527
But the hunt never ends.

20:09.477 --> 20:11.907
Is this the velvet touch
you give all your victims?

20:11.913 --> 20:13.913
Turn the homeless
into pincushions...

20:13.915 --> 20:16.445
Before you send them
to the tubes.

20:18.852 --> 20:21.822
I detect disdain in your voice.

20:24.491 --> 20:28.031
Heart Enterprises picks up
where the government leaves off.

20:28.032 --> 20:32.029
We don't just hand out
free blankets and food vouchers.

20:32.033 --> 20:37.671
We give them a purpose, a drive,
a destiny.

20:37.672 --> 20:40.512
It's all very symbiotic
when you think about it.

20:43.777 --> 20:47.907
In return, they get heaven.

20:47.915 --> 20:49.545
And by "heaven,"

20:49.550 --> 20:51.820
you mean you get them
so addicted to red

20:51.821 --> 20:53.419
that it's impossible for them

20:53.421 --> 20:56.421
to lead normal lives ever again.

20:56.424 --> 20:58.659
Define "normal life" to me.

20:58.660 --> 21:01.790
Living on the streets,
constantly hungry,

21:01.796 --> 21:05.596
out in the cold, all alone.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.600
Given the choice between that
and eternal pleasure,

21:08.603 --> 21:10.603
I'd choose pleasure.

21:15.042 --> 21:17.912
You deserve all
the pleasure in the world.

21:30.557 --> 21:33.087
I don't do drugs.

21:33.094 --> 21:36.604
But there are so many
different forms of pleasure.

22:16.603 --> 22:19.740
How was that for you?

22:19.741 --> 22:22.041
We're almost halfway there.

22:25.012 --> 22:26.780
Great.

22:26.781 --> 22:28.611
I can't wait.

22:30.784 --> 22:33.053
Oh, and drink up.

22:33.054 --> 22:36.064
It'll make what's coming
a lot easier.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.767
You want some of this?

22:46.768 --> 22:49.898
Yeah?

22:49.904 --> 22:53.807
Now, go over there.

22:53.808 --> 22:56.676
And now sit.

22:56.677 --> 22:58.677
Wag your tail.

22:58.679 --> 23:01.679
Wag it, wag it, wag.
Wag your tail!

23:01.682 --> 23:04.782
Now lick your balls.

23:04.786 --> 23:07.017
Lick 'em, lick 'em, lick 'em,
lick 'em, lick 'em, lick 'em!

23:11.125 --> 23:12.685
Oh, my god.

23:12.693 --> 23:13.960
Dr. Kleinfeld.

23:13.961 --> 23:15.731
It's Grace, Grace d'argento.

23:15.732 --> 23:17.630
Dr. Kleinfeld,
you treated my sister, Karma.

23:17.632 --> 23:20.132
What the fuck?

23:22.036 --> 23:23.666
Dr. Kleinfeld, come back.

23:23.671 --> 23:24.902
Come back to me.
Come back to me!

23:26.207 --> 23:28.207
Dr. Kleinfeld, it's Grace.

23:28.209 --> 23:30.739
- Grace...
- Where's my sister?

23:30.745 --> 23:32.975
You gotta save them, Grace.

23:32.980 --> 23:34.580
You gotta stop them.

23:34.582 --> 23:35.852
- Them? Who "them"?
- Who's them?

23:35.853 --> 23:37.680
Who's them...

23:38.953 --> 23:40.853
Clear!

23:45.026 --> 23:46.786
Clear!

23:52.667 --> 23:54.697
No!

24:12.887 --> 24:15.887
No!

24:42.282 --> 24:44.182
What was that?

24:44.185 --> 24:46.015
I don't think I want to know.

25:03.938 --> 25:05.268
Clear, motherfucker.

25:09.124 --> 25:12.524
Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!

25:27.507 --> 25:29.107
You find Kleinfeld?

25:29.108 --> 25:31.248
- Couldn't get much out of him.
He's dead.

25:33.078 --> 25:35.080
What's with the skin?
You checking in here or...

25:35.081 --> 25:36.711
- Funny. I... i just...
- Yeah, I don't care.

25:36.716 --> 25:38.146
Put some pants on.
We can't fight like that.

25:38.150 --> 25:39.550
- Who's this?
- I'm Anne.

25:39.552 --> 25:40.813
And I think we should
go this way.

25:40.820 --> 25:42.220
- I used to work here...
- she worked here,

25:42.221 --> 25:43.781
so I thought maybe
she could help us.

25:43.789 --> 25:45.689
Anne, my sister checked in
about a year ago,

25:45.691 --> 25:47.521
- but I can't find her anywhere.
- I'm sorry.

25:47.527 --> 25:48.827
- She's gone missing...
- I was just a trauma nurse.

25:48.828 --> 25:50.228
I didn't deal
with any of the admins.

25:50.229 --> 25:53.159
<i>Hey...</i>

25:53.165 --> 25:55.200
<i>Batshit lunatics.</i>

25:55.201 --> 25:59.131
<i>I have a bag of
smax candy bars at reception</i>

25:59.138 --> 26:03.842
<i>for the first whackjob
that brings me the cop.</i>

26:03.843 --> 26:06.673
He's real good-looking.

26:06.679 --> 26:09.239
Feel free to change that.

26:20.759 --> 26:22.589
Got any ideas?

26:22.595 --> 26:23.595
Duck!

26:23.596 --> 26:24.726
<i>Suit up!</i>

26:27.733 --> 26:28.903
<i>Suit up!</i>

26:30.803 --> 26:33.703
<i>Uh, uh, uh, uh...</i>

26:39.579 --> 26:40.639
whoa!

26:40.646 --> 26:43.686
- Officer?
- This way, this way.

26:45.751 --> 26:47.611
<i>Suit up!</i>

26:47.620 --> 26:49.620
This way, this way!

26:50.923 --> 26:52.893
Go, go, go!

26:57.163 --> 26:59.763
We need to stop.

26:59.765 --> 27:02.765
So far, the only thing crazier
than rib bone's candy army

27:02.768 --> 27:04.206
is not having a plan, okay?

27:04.207 --> 27:05.803
I think we need to take
a little...

27:25.824 --> 27:27.794
give me a second, okay?

27:29.729 --> 27:31.729
Grace, I don't feel right.

27:31.731 --> 27:34.731
I feel like my heart's
gonna beat out of my chest.

27:34.734 --> 27:37.004
Okay, uh, just go outside
and get some fresh air, okay?

27:37.005 --> 27:39.771
I'll be there
in five minutes, I swear.

27:39.772 --> 27:40.902
Okay?

27:40.906 --> 27:42.906
Grace...

28:30.389 --> 28:31.789
Where did you get this?

28:31.791 --> 28:33.052
Grace, what the hell
are you doing?

28:33.059 --> 28:34.319
This was Karma's locket.

28:34.326 --> 28:35.764
She would have never
taken it off.

28:35.765 --> 28:36.991
Now, this bitch better have

28:36.996 --> 28:38.896
a damn good explanation
as to why she has it.

28:38.898 --> 28:42.008
She can't explain anything
if you're choking her.

28:42.009 --> 28:43.431
Fine.

28:43.436 --> 28:44.866
We'll do it your way.

28:46.405 --> 28:48.005
- That's...
- You're still choking her.

28:48.007 --> 28:50.007
Back off, Barbie.

28:50.009 --> 28:51.870
- I didn't know it was Karma.
- She left it behind

28:51.877 --> 28:53.117
when they checked her
out of here.

28:53.118 --> 28:54.772
Who's they?

28:54.780 --> 28:56.341
- It was months ago.
- I don't remember his name.

28:56.348 --> 28:58.018
Why didn't anybody contact me?

28:58.019 --> 28:59.957
- I don't know.
- Where did they take her?

28:59.958 --> 29:01.412
I don't know!

29:01.420 --> 29:03.020
- Damn it!
- Do you know anything?

29:07.960 --> 29:11.090
All the outtake paperwork's in
a storage closet by reception.

29:11.097 --> 29:13.097
I-I could take you there.

29:13.099 --> 29:14.459
That's where rib bone is.

29:14.467 --> 29:15.934
Great.

29:15.935 --> 29:17.905
We kill two birds, one stone.
You in?

29:17.906 --> 29:20.733
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

29:20.740 --> 29:22.740
Go.

29:28.447 --> 29:32.383
Just 'cause my cpu
is far superior to your brain

29:32.384 --> 29:34.814
doesn't mean
I don't understand you.

29:35.987 --> 29:38.790
You were free.

29:38.791 --> 29:42.360
You never had to see me
ever again.

29:42.361 --> 29:44.161
And yet, you couldn't
help yourself.

29:44.163 --> 29:46.431
You had to be...

29:46.432 --> 29:49.502
What do you humans call it?

29:56.041 --> 29:59.471
A hero?

30:04.950 --> 30:06.780
What the hell
did you give to me?

30:06.786 --> 30:11.086
Arabica Espresso,
coconut water, some karo syrup,

30:11.090 --> 30:14.020
and 4 milliliters of patented

30:14.026 --> 30:16.026
synthetic amebic dysentery.

30:19.964 --> 30:23.064
They engineer it
two floors down.

30:26.405 --> 30:28.205
I need a bathroom!

30:28.207 --> 30:30.577
Now, now,
no premature eruptions.

30:30.578 --> 30:34.813
We need everything you've got.

30:34.814 --> 30:37.944
Aki, whatever... whatever
you're thinking about doing,

30:37.950 --> 30:40.510
you don't have to do it,
you don't have to...

30:44.990 --> 30:47.390
If you want the best apple,

30:47.393 --> 30:49.523
you've gotta pluck it
straight from the tree.

30:52.131 --> 30:53.831
Oh, shit!

30:53.833 --> 30:55.863
Exactly.

31:05.307 --> 31:07.247
You guys go for the records.

31:07.248 --> 31:10.342
I'll take care of rib bone.

31:10.345 --> 31:11.345
Hey.

31:11.346 --> 31:12.780
Where is he...

31:12.781 --> 31:13.781
sic 'em.

31:15.851 --> 31:19.181
What's your story?

31:19.187 --> 31:21.187
I want my candy.

31:24.859 --> 31:27.759
- Where's my candy?
- Bitch!

31:37.672 --> 31:39.372
Welcome to wonderland, Alice.

31:39.374 --> 31:41.614
<i>Let go of me,
you jizzy pedophile!</i>

31:41.615 --> 31:43.340
I know my rights!

31:43.345 --> 31:44.912
Come on!

31:44.913 --> 31:46.243
Get off me!

31:46.248 --> 31:47.808
Off me!

31:50.352 --> 31:51.921
I know it may not feel like it,

31:51.922 --> 31:54.150
but you're doing
the right thing.

31:54.156 --> 31:56.690
Get off!

31:56.691 --> 31:59.691
You're so full of shit, Grace!

31:59.694 --> 32:01.362
Twatsicle whore!

32:01.363 --> 32:04.293
I hope that primo dick
gave you gonorrhea!

32:04.299 --> 32:05.829
What now, doctor?

32:05.834 --> 32:08.734
I have never seen anybody
take so much red.

32:08.737 --> 32:12.206
We're not even sure what the
long-term consequences might be.

32:12.207 --> 32:14.207
She may very well
have permanent psychosis.

32:14.209 --> 32:16.169
She's gonna have to stay
indefinitely.

32:16.178 --> 32:18.178
The state will cover
two weeks payment.

32:18.180 --> 32:21.910
Do you have a plan
to pay her bills after that?

32:21.917 --> 32:25.252
I'll figure something out.

32:25.253 --> 32:27.383
Grace!

32:27.389 --> 32:30.819
Wait, Grace! Grace!

32:30.825 --> 32:32.593
Grace!

32:32.594 --> 32:34.594
<i>Grace, don't leave me!</i>

32:34.596 --> 32:37.596
<i>Please, Grace, don't leave me!</i>

32:56.250 --> 32:57.710
Mahalo.

32:59.353 --> 33:00.783
Looking for this?

33:00.789 --> 33:02.689
Fuck did you do to my car?

33:02.691 --> 33:03.891
Who the hell are you?

33:03.892 --> 33:05.962
Try "thank you," it's easier.

33:07.761 --> 33:09.230
I wasn't even in there
for an hour.

33:09.231 --> 33:10.431
How did you do this?

33:10.432 --> 33:13.432
I saw you talking to the primo.

33:13.435 --> 33:15.970
You're a real firecracker.

33:15.971 --> 33:17.771
Devotion to family...

33:17.772 --> 33:21.472
That's a rare commodity
these days.

33:21.476 --> 33:23.911
I don't have time for this shit.

33:23.912 --> 33:26.382
That's what I like
about you, Grace.

33:26.383 --> 33:28.911
You see right through
everybody's bullshit.

33:28.917 --> 33:30.384
I'll be brief.

33:30.385 --> 33:32.720
Blood drivers!

33:32.721 --> 33:35.721
They bathe in quite
the spotlight.

33:35.724 --> 33:39.724
You seem like the type of girl
who likes to win.

33:39.728 --> 33:45.428
How would you like to be
the new primo?

33:49.738 --> 33:51.998
Not interested.

33:52.007 --> 33:53.307
Oh.

33:56.778 --> 33:58.778
They also make a lot of money.

33:58.780 --> 34:01.040
You can do it
for the cash prize.

34:01.049 --> 34:03.049
Sounds like your
little sister is in need

34:03.051 --> 34:07.051
of some very expensive
medical care.

34:07.055 --> 34:10.295
What do you say?

34:21.034 --> 34:23.435
You promised a whole bag
of fucking candy!

34:23.438 --> 34:24.898
Where's my candy?

34:32.047 --> 34:34.817
- Hey, asshole.
- Come fight me like a man.

34:34.818 --> 34:39.025
See what happens
when I'm looking at you.

34:42.757 --> 34:44.857
Come on, pretty boy.

35:00.474 --> 35:01.774
Ouch.

35:01.776 --> 35:04.976
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

35:12.487 --> 35:14.787
I've always wanted to do that.

35:25.566 --> 35:27.134
Come on, pretty boy.

35:27.135 --> 35:30.135
Show me what you got.

36:03.904 --> 36:05.504
Hey, rib bone.

36:05.507 --> 36:07.907
Are you this gentle in bed?

36:07.909 --> 36:09.639
Actually, I should
ask your bitch...

36:09.644 --> 36:12.079
Sorry, your dog.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.540
No, your bitch.

36:13.548 --> 36:16.808
Insulting caligula's virtue...

36:16.818 --> 36:19.818
Is a line you do not cross!

36:30.931 --> 36:32.501
Stop!

36:35.003 --> 36:37.003
Like I said...

36:37.005 --> 36:39.573
You catch more flies...

36:39.574 --> 36:40.904
With sugar.

36:40.909 --> 36:42.569
Ah, fuck.

37:25.605 --> 37:27.475
Grace, let's go.

37:32.312 --> 37:35.242
Grace, we gotta go!

37:41.521 --> 37:44.521
Why don't you just kill me?

37:44.524 --> 37:47.793
They wanted to put you
in a blood-fracking suit,

37:47.794 --> 37:51.094
but I could never waste
a specimen like you.

37:53.432 --> 37:55.562
Wait...

37:55.569 --> 37:58.838
Those people I saw
hanging from tubes...

37:58.839 --> 38:01.874
You're taking their blood?

38:01.875 --> 38:03.642
Yes.

38:03.643 --> 38:05.773
But there are so many other ways

38:05.779 --> 38:08.489
to serve Heart Enterprises.

38:11.484 --> 38:13.454
You've got spunk...

38:15.754 --> 38:18.524
And I'm here
to get it out of you.

38:21.394 --> 38:23.524
What the...

38:23.530 --> 38:25.830
Time for your next
fluid extraction.

38:25.832 --> 38:29.401
Do you want the hand
or the probe?

38:29.402 --> 38:32.402
- The hand.
- Definitely the hand.

38:41.380 --> 38:44.510
Oh, my god.

39:40.574 --> 39:42.544
Four out of five.

39:43.976 --> 39:45.976
Just one fluid left.

39:45.979 --> 39:48.479
Why...

39:48.481 --> 39:52.751
Why do you need
all this from me?

39:52.752 --> 39:55.752
I don't.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.360
All I really needed was this.

40:24.617 --> 40:28.517
I had a feeling The Scholar
would keep his word.

40:28.521 --> 40:31.921
I can't believe
we pulled one over on slink.

40:38.932 --> 40:40.932
Welcome home.

40:43.937 --> 40:46.937
In case you haven't noticed,
your leashes are back on.

40:49.409 --> 40:51.809
Though I might suggest
changing your undies

40:51.811 --> 40:54.711
before rejoining the party.

40:54.714 --> 40:56.714
Toodle-oo!

41:07.527 --> 41:10.627
I'm sorry we didn't find Karma.

41:14.734 --> 41:16.864
We will.

41:32.551 --> 41:35.081
How's that possible?

41:35.088 --> 41:38.857
He knows where my sister is.

41:38.858 --> 41:40.828
The question is...

41:42.594 --> 41:45.464
Are you gonna help me
get it out of him?

41:46.305 --> 41:52.781
