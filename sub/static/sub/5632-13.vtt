WEBVTT

00:04.851 --> 00:07.084
<i>Help! Mom! Dad!</i>

00:09.756 --> 00:11.789
Oh, God.

00:11.824 --> 00:13.224
Christine, it's okay,

00:13.259 --> 00:14.259
Mommy and Daddy are here.

00:14.294 --> 00:16.193
Get away, don't hurt me.

00:16.229 --> 00:17.495
No, no, no, no, no,
no one's going to hurt you.

00:17.530 --> 00:19.196
Okay, everything's going
to be okay.

00:19.232 --> 00:20.565
You're fine,
you're just having a nightmare.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.401
The monster, it came
out of the closet.

00:23.436 --> 00:24.902
Oh, there's no monster
in the closet.

00:24.938 --> 00:26.504
Remember when I tucked you in,
you know.

00:26.539 --> 00:27.705
I came and I scared

00:27.740 --> 00:28.906
the monster away.

00:28.942 --> 00:31.142
No, you didn't, Booth.

00:31.177 --> 00:32.509
Monsters are not real,

00:32.545 --> 00:33.644
therefore you had
nothing to scare away.

00:33.680 --> 00:34.845
Your mother is right,

00:34.881 --> 00:36.380
but what I meant
to say is that, look,

00:36.416 --> 00:38.783
I would never let anything
happen to you, okay?

00:38.818 --> 00:39.884
You don't believe me.

00:39.919 --> 00:41.018
It was here.

00:41.054 --> 00:43.421
I'm sure it felt
very real to you.

00:43.456 --> 00:44.856
Can... can I sleep
with you tonight?

00:44.891 --> 00:46.424
Of course, sweetheart.
Come on.

00:46.459 --> 00:47.992
Anything for my little girl,
come on, jump up, jump up.

00:48.027 --> 00:49.460
Come on, you're into bed.

00:49.495 --> 00:51.262
You're in between me
and Mom tonight, okay.

00:51.297 --> 00:53.064
Don't snore, whatever you do.

00:56.302 --> 00:57.368
Hey, there you are.
Yeah.

00:57.403 --> 00:58.469
I got something for you.

00:58.504 --> 00:59.637
Look, if it's not a cup

00:59.672 --> 01:01.505
of coffee about this big,
I'm not interested.

01:01.541 --> 01:03.040
Rough night, huh?

01:03.076 --> 01:04.909
Yeah, Christine, she's been
having these really bad,

01:04.944 --> 01:07.111
Freddy Krueger-like nightmares

01:07.146 --> 01:09.714
about monsters in her closet.

01:09.749 --> 01:11.549
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
That's terrible.

01:11.584 --> 01:14.752
Where's my cup?
Aw, geez.

01:14.787 --> 01:16.020
Uh, she... you know what?

01:16.055 --> 01:17.455
It's going to be fine, okay?

01:17.490 --> 01:19.824
Every parent has to deal
with this kind of stuff.

01:19.859 --> 01:21.659
You want my advice?

01:21.694 --> 01:23.628
Your advice, right,
because you're a single guy

01:23.663 --> 01:25.696
who knows how to deal with kids.
No, trust me.

01:25.732 --> 01:26.964
Look, the key
is that Christine's

01:27.000 --> 01:29.033
got to confront
the monster head-on.

01:29.068 --> 01:30.568
She's got to get out
of the bed,

01:30.603 --> 01:31.869
walk up to the closet,

01:31.904 --> 01:33.771
tell the monster to go bye-bye,

01:33.806 --> 01:36.007
or else her dad's going
to put a cap in his ass.

01:36.042 --> 01:38.275
What do you got?
What is this?

01:38.311 --> 01:41.178
A body was found
in Cherrywood Park.

01:41.214 --> 01:43.247
A dog walker nearly got
his arm yanked off when his

01:43.282 --> 01:45.449
pooch patrol
attacked the remains.

01:45.485 --> 01:47.184
Great.

01:47.220 --> 01:48.719
Look at that,
flesh is all dried out

01:48.755 --> 01:50.421
like a piece of rawhide.

01:50.456 --> 01:53.024
Local PD's bringing the body
to the Jeffersonian.

01:53.059 --> 01:55.126
Something's not right here.

01:55.161 --> 01:56.927
It's a dead body that
was used as a chew toy.

01:56.963 --> 01:58.462
There's nothing right about it.

01:58.498 --> 02:00.231
Have you been
to Cherrywood Park before?

02:00.266 --> 02:01.465
Single guy in that park?

02:01.501 --> 02:02.800
It's just a little creepy,
isn't it?

02:02.835 --> 02:03.901
Cherrywood's more
of a family hangout.

02:03.936 --> 02:05.436
Right, exactly.

02:05.471 --> 02:07.338
So how could a body be there
long enough to dry up

02:07.373 --> 02:08.973
without somebody noticing?

02:09.008 --> 02:10.274
So this was a body dump?

02:10.309 --> 02:13.077
Somebody wanted the body
to be found, right?

02:13.112 --> 02:14.478
<i>High and rounded</i>

02:14.514 --> 02:17.381
frontal bone with
a slight browridge,

02:17.417 --> 02:19.383
suggests the victim
was a Caucasian female.

02:20.553 --> 02:21.719
Well, and the
way she's dressed

02:21.754 --> 02:23.320
is really dated.

02:23.356 --> 02:24.555
This pleated skirt,

02:24.590 --> 02:25.723
the shoes.

02:25.758 --> 02:26.724
So not just a murder victim,

02:26.759 --> 02:27.725
but a fashion victim as well.

02:27.760 --> 02:28.793
Hodgins,

02:28.828 --> 02:30.194
that was uncalled for.

02:30.229 --> 02:32.730
I must insist you show
respect to the deceased.

02:32.765 --> 02:33.964
Yeah, don't hold your breath.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.033
These days, he's not
respectful to the living,

02:36.069 --> 02:38.869
so I'm not sure why the dead
would be any different.

02:38.905 --> 02:40.938
Well, for one thing,
she doesn't talk back.

02:42.075 --> 02:43.040
Enough.

02:43.076 --> 02:44.408
Do you hear me?

02:49.949 --> 02:50.949
Sorry.

02:50.983 --> 02:53.250
You have no reason to apologize.

02:53.286 --> 02:55.119
Do you want me to send him home?

02:55.154 --> 02:58.055
Uh, no. Home is worse.

02:58.091 --> 02:59.857
Believe it or not, this is

02:59.892 --> 03:02.093
Hodgins at his happiest.

03:02.128 --> 03:04.395
By the way, uh,
there's so much damage

03:04.430 --> 03:05.863
to the left side of the skull

03:05.898 --> 03:08.566
that a facial reconstruction
is not going to be easy.

03:08.601 --> 03:09.900
I see what you mean.

03:09.936 --> 03:11.869
There are
multiple comminuted fractures

03:11.904 --> 03:15.506
to the left frontal, sphenoid,
temporal, and zygomatic.

03:15.541 --> 03:16.807
So cause of death's most likely

03:16.843 --> 03:18.008
blunt force trauma
to the skull?

03:18.044 --> 03:19.210
It's possible,

03:19.245 --> 03:20.444
but I won't know until more

03:20.480 --> 03:21.445
of the tissue has been removed.

03:21.481 --> 03:22.880
Speaking of which,

03:22.915 --> 03:25.449
the way this tissue's
been desiccated is odd.

03:25.485 --> 03:27.585
I'm not seeing any adipocere.

03:27.620 --> 03:29.587
Uh, you're definitely
going to want to see this.

03:29.622 --> 03:32.223
This is officially creepy.

03:36.162 --> 03:37.762
Wow, is that a mix tape?

03:37.797 --> 03:40.331
It's all vintage,
just like the clothes, and yeah,

03:40.366 --> 03:41.332
look at the label.

03:41.367 --> 03:43.167
It says "Home."

03:43.202 --> 03:44.301
And then check out this Bible.

03:44.337 --> 03:46.270
It's got earmarks throughout.

03:46.305 --> 03:47.671
We should get this
to Booth right away.

03:47.707 --> 03:49.774
He's very well-versed
in Scripture.

03:49.809 --> 03:51.509
Hold on, the Bible is just

03:51.544 --> 03:53.844
the tip of the iceberg.

03:59.485 --> 04:00.651
Bones, what are you
doing here?

04:00.686 --> 04:01.652
I wanted to give you the latest

04:01.687 --> 04:03.087
on what the lab has found.

04:03.122 --> 04:07.725
The evidence collected
is far from normal.

04:07.760 --> 04:10.094
Okay, well, why don't you
show me what you got?

04:10.129 --> 04:13.464
Cam finished her analysis
of the flesh.

04:13.499 --> 04:14.832
It wasn't desiccated due to

04:14.867 --> 04:15.933
environmental factors.

04:15.968 --> 04:17.267
It was because the killer

04:17.303 --> 04:19.370
removed the skin, soaked it,

04:19.404 --> 04:20.571
and then scraped away the fat.

04:20.606 --> 04:22.106
You mean like taxidermy.

04:22.141 --> 04:25.042
And then, once Cam removed
a section of flesh,

04:25.077 --> 04:26.710
I discovered this.

04:26.746 --> 04:28.212
What is that, a wire?

04:28.247 --> 04:29.980
Before placing the taxidermied

04:30.016 --> 04:31.315
skin back on,

04:31.350 --> 04:33.918
first, the killer
articulated the skeleton.

04:33.953 --> 04:35.486
I found wear
along the joints.

04:35.521 --> 04:36.854
It appears

04:36.889 --> 04:39.223
the killer repositioned
the body frequently,

04:39.258 --> 04:41.091
in a manner of his choosing.

04:41.127 --> 04:44.695
Whoa, whoa. Are you saying
that he... but... uh...

04:44.730 --> 04:47.198
No, there's no evidence
the killer did anything sexual

04:47.233 --> 04:48.933
with the deceased; however,

04:48.968 --> 04:51.468
based on the deterioration
of the tissue,

04:51.504 --> 04:55.172
he lived with the body
for an extended period of time.

04:55.208 --> 04:57.174
Wh... how long?

04:57.210 --> 04:59.343
At least six months.

04:59.378 --> 05:01.745
But then something must
have happened.

05:01.781 --> 05:03.781
I-I found found multiple

05:03.816 --> 05:07.184
postmortem blunt force trauma
injuries to the skull.

05:07.220 --> 05:08.819
It's almost like
he broke up the skull

05:08.855 --> 05:10.688
to conceal the
victim's identity.

05:10.723 --> 05:12.690
But the teeth are still intact.

05:12.725 --> 05:14.258
Which means he wasn't trying

05:14.293 --> 05:15.459
to obfuscate identity.

05:15.494 --> 05:16.527
Wow, it's crazy.

05:16.562 --> 05:17.728
It's almost as if he saw

05:17.763 --> 05:19.063
the victim as still alive,

05:19.098 --> 05:20.331
and... and he became angry,

05:20.366 --> 05:21.899
and he had to kill her
all over again.

05:21.934 --> 05:23.334
As I said,

05:23.369 --> 05:28.873
the evidence thus far
is anything but normal.

06:20.664 --> 06:22.030
step out of the Stone Age.

06:22.066 --> 06:23.699
No, she already did.

06:23.734 --> 06:25.200
I just wanted to

06:25.236 --> 06:27.436
listen to it once, you know.

06:27.471 --> 06:30.138
Hear it the way
it was intended to be heard.

06:30.174 --> 06:32.608
You, uh, pick up on anything?

06:32.643 --> 06:34.042
No.

06:34.078 --> 06:35.577
I'm guessing since
everything from her purse

06:35.613 --> 06:37.546
is here, the lab didn't find
anything, either?

06:37.581 --> 06:38.547
Nothing.

06:38.582 --> 06:40.082
No fingerprints.
Not a trace.

06:40.117 --> 06:41.550
The only thing they got

06:41.585 --> 06:44.987
is some desiccated skin cell
off the lipstick.

06:45.022 --> 06:47.389
Which means that
the killer applied it

06:47.424 --> 06:49.524
to the victim after she died?

06:49.560 --> 06:52.127
He was grooming her.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.695
What about the Bible?

06:53.731 --> 06:55.897
Uh, reading some passages

06:55.933 --> 06:58.033
that have been marked here.

06:58.068 --> 07:02.804
Second Corinthians 5:10,
5:21, John 3:4...

07:02.840 --> 07:04.439
I know that one.

07:04.475 --> 07:07.376
That's, uh, that's something
about sin and lawlessness.

07:07.411 --> 07:09.044
Everything I've read so far

07:09.079 --> 07:11.046
deals with punishment
for the wicked.

07:11.081 --> 07:13.315
When I get all this together,

07:13.350 --> 07:16.285
I'm going to send it over
to Karen Delfs at the BRIU.

07:16.320 --> 07:17.786
That's good thinking,
start building a profile.

07:17.821 --> 07:19.388
Yeah.

07:19.423 --> 07:23.191
The question is: whose profile
are we building here?

07:23.227 --> 07:25.027
Is this for the victim, or...

07:25.062 --> 07:28.263
Does it say more about
who killed her?

07:30.000 --> 07:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:40.944 --> 07:41.910
Hey.

07:41.945 --> 07:44.379
Oh, God.

07:44.415 --> 07:47.316
Sorry, I... I... I didn't,
uh, see you there.

07:47.351 --> 07:49.551
I thought you'd be used to
looking down on me by now.

07:49.586 --> 07:52.187
I don't look down
on you, Hodgins.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.989
It's, it's not fair.

07:54.024 --> 07:56.458
Oh, really, you're going to tell
the paraplegic what's fair?

07:56.493 --> 07:57.859
Okay, no, this should be good.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.394
What do you want?
Me?

07:59.430 --> 08:01.129
Nothing.

08:01.165 --> 08:03.165
Cam, however,
was hoping for an update

08:03.200 --> 08:04.399
on your reconstruction,

08:04.435 --> 08:05.734
but judging by what I see,

08:05.769 --> 08:07.302
I'll just tell her
that you'll be done

08:07.338 --> 08:10.472
approximately by the time
I start walking again.

08:10.507 --> 08:11.907
Can you give me ten seconds?

08:11.942 --> 08:13.608
Why? You don't even
have half the face.

08:13.644 --> 08:15.210
Yeah, but with
the half I do have,

08:15.245 --> 08:17.379
I can make a mirror image.

08:20.984 --> 08:23.118
See?

08:23.153 --> 08:25.220
And since I already have all
the tissue depth measurements,

08:25.255 --> 08:27.422
I just...

08:31.595 --> 08:35.297
Hey, look at that.

08:36.700 --> 08:39.735
Okay, normally this is
the time when you say,

08:39.770 --> 08:41.770
"Good work, Angela."

08:41.804 --> 08:43.572
You want a pat on the back,
you should find someone

08:43.607 --> 08:45.073
not confined to a chair.

08:47.244 --> 08:48.810
What about a match
to missing persons?

08:48.846 --> 08:51.747
Okay, I'll run it now.

09:00.424 --> 09:02.090
Allison Monroe.

09:02.126 --> 09:03.625
42.

09:06.029 --> 09:08.630
Man, look at her,
she's so happy.

09:08.665 --> 09:10.065
So she was reported missing

09:10.100 --> 09:13.468
by her husband six months ago.

09:13.504 --> 09:17.205
She disappeared a week before
their tenth anniversary.

09:24.815 --> 09:28.183
Hello, hello, welcome.

09:28.218 --> 09:31.119
Please, have a seat.

09:31.155 --> 09:33.388
Can I get either
one of you anything,

09:33.424 --> 09:34.823
perhaps a cup of tea?

09:34.858 --> 09:37.192
I have English Breakfast
and Chamomile.

09:37.227 --> 09:40.328
They are organic
if that's important to you.

09:40.364 --> 09:41.496
Are... I'm sor... Are you okay?

09:41.532 --> 09:43.131
Oh, um,

09:43.167 --> 09:44.733
what my partner means

09:44.768 --> 09:46.868
is that you're not exhibiting

09:46.904 --> 09:48.403
any of the normal emotions

09:48.439 --> 09:50.405
associated with learning

09:50.441 --> 09:52.340
that a loved one
has been murdered.

09:52.376 --> 09:55.043
I apologize for not
seeming more surprised.

09:55.078 --> 09:57.546
My wife wasn't the type
of woman that just went missing.

09:57.581 --> 09:59.247
Even a couple hours
after she was gone,

09:59.283 --> 10:00.682
I knew she wasn't
coming back.

10:00.717 --> 10:01.783
When was the last time
you saw her?

10:01.819 --> 10:03.218
Just over six months ago.

10:03.253 --> 10:04.619
It's all in the
missing persons report.

10:04.655 --> 10:07.522
Our file says that she
was a social worker?

10:07.558 --> 10:11.827
Allison volunteered to take
on the most difficult cases,

10:11.862 --> 10:13.195
and she did
everything she could

10:13.230 --> 10:15.397
to place those children
in good homes.

10:15.432 --> 10:17.466
Mr. Monroe, we found a purse

10:17.501 --> 10:19.734
next to her
that had items in it.

10:19.770 --> 10:24.172
Among those items was a
mix tape labeled "Home"

10:24.208 --> 10:25.440
and a Bible.

10:25.476 --> 10:26.441
That doesn't make any sense.

10:26.477 --> 10:28.043
Allison wasn't religious.

10:28.078 --> 10:29.311
And as for a mix tape,

10:29.346 --> 10:31.012
I don't think I've
seen one in years.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.148
Well, we know that you already
spoke to the local PD.

10:33.183 --> 10:35.150
Can you think of anyone who'd
want to hurt your wife?

10:35.185 --> 10:36.418
I would suggest

10:36.453 --> 10:37.719
speaking to Neal Hogan.

10:37.754 --> 10:39.721
He was your wife's supervisor?

10:39.756 --> 10:41.523
Because of the type
of cases she took on,

10:41.558 --> 10:44.860
from time to time, uh,
she received threats.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.495
She assured me
they were nothing,

10:46.530 --> 10:47.462
but I could tell she was scared.

10:47.498 --> 10:48.763
And I'm guessing
those threats

10:48.799 --> 10:50.065
came from the parents whose kids

10:50.100 --> 10:51.233
were taken away from them.

10:51.268 --> 10:53.435
And from
prospective foster parents.

10:53.470 --> 10:55.103
People that Allison

10:55.138 --> 10:58.139
deemed unfit
to care for a child.

11:06.483 --> 11:07.582
Arastoo.

11:07.618 --> 11:09.417
Uh, I'm sorry.

11:09.453 --> 11:13.388
Dr. Brennan told me she'd
be bringing in outside help.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.857
She just failed to mention
it would be you.

11:15.893 --> 11:17.359
That's not a surprise.

11:17.394 --> 11:19.160
I suppose to her,
our past isn't even a factor.

11:19.196 --> 11:20.562
No, I'm sure

11:20.597 --> 11:23.498
she just grabbed
the best person she could find.

11:23.534 --> 11:26.668
Uh, just so you know,
I should be finished

11:26.703 --> 11:28.904
reassembling the skull
any minute now.

11:28.939 --> 11:31.973
And I will have the rest
of the bones ready shortly,

11:32.009 --> 11:34.509
just as soon as I have finished
macerating the tissue.

11:34.545 --> 11:36.044
Did you find anything
on your initial exam?

11:36.079 --> 11:38.246
Yes, based on the scrape marks,

11:38.282 --> 11:41.316
it appears a buck knife was used
to scrape away the fat.

11:41.351 --> 11:42.617
So the killer could be a hunter.

11:42.653 --> 11:43.685
Also,

11:43.720 --> 11:44.953
I found several holes

11:44.988 --> 11:46.588
bored through the tissue
into the bone.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.723
Hodgins thinks it could
be caused by termites.

11:48.759 --> 11:50.325
Wait a second,
was one of the holes here?

11:50.360 --> 11:51.993
Yeah, why?

11:52.029 --> 11:53.228
I need Dr. Hodgins.

11:53.263 --> 11:54.496
We have to swab
the victim's teeth.

11:54.531 --> 11:56.398
Arastoo, what's going on?

11:56.433 --> 11:59.167
I have a bad feeling I've seen
this kind of damage before.

12:02.539 --> 12:04.172
Dr. Brennan, I'm telling you,

12:04.207 --> 12:06.308
there's too many similarities
for this to be a coincidence.

12:06.343 --> 12:07.809
Please, allow me to judge.

12:07.844 --> 12:09.110
Dr. Hodgins, what did you find?

12:09.146 --> 12:11.246
I studied the holes.
Definitely not termites.

12:11.281 --> 12:13.548
More likely, they were made
by some kind of drill.

12:13.584 --> 12:15.250
And the holes are identical

12:15.285 --> 12:17.052
to those found on this
other set of remains?

12:17.087 --> 12:18.853
As you can see,
we don't have a full skeleton.

12:18.889 --> 12:21.289
However, the holes in the radius
and tibia are a match.

12:21.325 --> 12:23.091
Then, there's the damage
to the teeth.

12:23.126 --> 12:24.893
What damage are
you referring to?

12:24.928 --> 12:26.628
On both bodies,

12:26.663 --> 12:29.164
postmortem breaks of the central
and lateral incisors.

12:29.199 --> 12:30.465
In other words,

12:30.500 --> 12:32.701
the victim's teeth
were chipped as the killer

12:32.736 --> 12:34.669
spoon-fed his corpses.

12:34.705 --> 12:36.037
I swabbed.

12:36.073 --> 12:38.306
It seems like he fed them
some kind of porridge.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.709
The second set of remains,

12:40.744 --> 12:42.510
where did you find them?

12:42.546 --> 12:44.913
The bones were first discovered
in Chapman State Park.

12:44.948 --> 12:46.214
There's no flesh
on these remains,

12:46.249 --> 12:47.649
'cause they
were thoroughly scavenged

12:47.684 --> 12:49.284
by coyotes,
who probably couldn't get enough

12:49.319 --> 12:51.086
of that rawhide flesh.

12:51.121 --> 12:52.654
The victim was never identified.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.090
His remains were stored
in Limbo at the Jeffersonian.

12:55.125 --> 12:56.224
Impossible.

12:56.259 --> 12:57.425
I have personally catalogued

12:57.461 --> 12:59.961
every set
of unidentified remains.

12:59.997 --> 13:01.630
Actually, these remains were
catalogued during the time

13:01.665 --> 13:03.665
when you and Booth
quit your jobs.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.400
Their existence proves
we're not dealing

13:05.435 --> 13:07.235
with an amateur psychopath.

13:07.270 --> 13:10.271
This guy's a serial murderer.

13:15.404 --> 13:18.910
It's strange, looking strictly
at the osteological evidence,

13:18.912 --> 13:21.045
the two victims had
almost nothing in common.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.646
Right, I see what you mean.

13:22.681 --> 13:25.181
Allison Monroe
was a Caucasian female,

13:25.217 --> 13:27.017
in her mid-40s,

13:27.052 --> 13:29.486
while the hyperbolic palate

13:29.522 --> 13:32.389
of this unidentified victim

13:32.425 --> 13:34.458
suggests a black male.

13:34.493 --> 13:36.960
Based on the erratic
ossification of his pubic faces,

13:36.995 --> 13:39.529
my best estimate for age
was mid-50s.

13:39.564 --> 13:41.932
I see most of the
facial bones are missing.

13:41.967 --> 13:43.766
They were consumed
by scavengers,

13:43.802 --> 13:46.136
making it impossible for Angela
to do a facial reconstruction.

13:46.171 --> 13:48.104
Then we should test for isotopes
in the tooth enamel,

13:48.140 --> 13:50.006
see if we can determine
where he grew up.

13:50.042 --> 13:51.408
I did that when the remains
were first brought in,

13:51.443 --> 13:53.076
the results were inconclusive.

13:53.111 --> 13:55.711
Then we should test for
heavy metals and pesticides.

13:55.747 --> 14:00.049
Again, I tested for those
during my initial examination.

14:00.084 --> 14:01.951
I see.

14:02.123 --> 14:04.690
It appears you've done
everything you could.

14:06.928 --> 14:10.829
Therefore,
you should not feel any guilt

14:10.865 --> 14:14.166
that the killer
has taken another life.

14:14.202 --> 14:16.969
Dr. Brennan, I assure you,
my conscience is clear.

14:17.004 --> 14:19.872
Good.

14:19.907 --> 14:24.977
I am relieved you are not
burdened by such feelings.

14:25.012 --> 14:27.313
Shall we continue?

14:35.990 --> 14:39.391
Okay, Doc, lay it on us,
what do you think?

14:39.427 --> 14:41.227
All right, well in my
professional opinion,

14:41.262 --> 14:43.495
I would say that this killer
is extremely intelligent,

14:43.531 --> 14:45.464
possibly schizophrenic,

14:45.499 --> 14:47.666
and completely
and totally cray-cray.

14:47.702 --> 14:49.068
Cray-cray, what's that mean?

14:49.103 --> 14:51.303
Oh, it's slang for crazy.

14:51.339 --> 14:52.605
What are you, 13?

14:52.640 --> 14:53.640
No-- I'm sorry.

14:53.674 --> 14:55.007
I've just been going through

14:55.042 --> 14:56.542
Dr. Sweets' old files
on the two of you,

14:56.577 --> 14:58.110
and in them he states that you

14:58.145 --> 15:00.446
are easily annoyed
by overly complex

15:00.481 --> 15:01.580
and officious
sounding language.

15:01.616 --> 15:03.015
But I will make an
addendum to that

15:03.050 --> 15:04.984
that says you are just
easily annoyed in general.

15:05.019 --> 15:06.252
Tell you what, why don't you
put a little Post-it

15:06.287 --> 15:07.720
next to the little addendum

15:07.755 --> 15:09.421
that I'm not annoyed, okay?

15:09.457 --> 15:10.756
So why don't we start over?

15:10.791 --> 15:12.346
Allison Monroe,
let's focus on that, okay?

15:12.369 --> 15:13.225
Okay.

15:13.227 --> 15:15.661
The fact that nothing sexual was
done to the body implies to me

15:15.696 --> 15:17.796
that our killer chose her
as sort of a surrogate mother.

15:17.832 --> 15:18.864
So he has mommy issues.

15:18.899 --> 15:20.399
A regular Norman Bates.

15:20.434 --> 15:22.735
The Bible that we found
on Allison Monroe's body,

15:22.770 --> 15:24.103
all the pages are marked

15:24.138 --> 15:26.138
and they have to deal
with punishment.

15:26.173 --> 15:27.806
That's because the killer wants
to be disciplined.

15:27.842 --> 15:29.842
So he knows what
he's doing is wrong.

15:29.877 --> 15:32.544
In life, Allison Monroe
was a strong

15:32.580 --> 15:34.380
but kind maternal figure.

15:34.415 --> 15:36.615
Our killer selected her
because he wanted someone

15:36.651 --> 15:37.816
who would give him boundaries.

15:37.852 --> 15:39.084
And stop him from killing again.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.120
But then the temptation

15:40.154 --> 15:41.520
grows too strong,

15:41.555 --> 15:42.755
so the killer "kills"
the surrogate mother

15:42.790 --> 15:45.024
so he's then free to kill again.

15:45.059 --> 15:46.925
Now, I put air quotes
around "kills"

15:46.961 --> 15:49.161
because you can't kill
someone who's already dead.

15:49.196 --> 15:51.297
You ever think maybe you're
a little cray-cray yourself?

15:51.332 --> 15:53.232
What about this other...
the second victim,

15:53.267 --> 15:54.233
this unidentified male?

15:54.268 --> 15:55.268
Look, I can't give you

15:55.303 --> 15:56.268
a full profile on our killer

15:56.304 --> 15:57.304
until you give me a name.

15:57.338 --> 15:58.304
No, I'm saying is,

15:58.339 --> 15:59.938
what if we reverse the process?

15:59.974 --> 16:01.407
You said that the killer wanted
to be disciplined.

16:01.442 --> 16:03.642
Right, so he wouldn't
choose just anyone.

16:03.678 --> 16:05.477
So, when going through
the missing persons,

16:05.513 --> 16:07.179
we can rule out anyone
who was homeless,

16:07.214 --> 16:08.280
down on their luck.

16:08.316 --> 16:09.548
That's right,
that's right.

16:09.583 --> 16:12.484
It would be a,
a strong male role model.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.720
Someone who was a,
a pillar of their community.

16:14.755 --> 16:16.322
I tell you what,
you and I, we're going to go

16:16.357 --> 16:17.923
check out missing persons,
see what we can come up with.

16:17.958 --> 16:21.093
You, you're going to go
interview Allison Monroe's boss.

16:21.128 --> 16:23.796
You got it, I'll get a list
of anyone who threatened her.

16:23.831 --> 16:26.465
Also anyone who paid her
undo amounts of attention.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.966
I'm just saying,
the killer didn't select her

16:28.002 --> 16:29.635
because he hated her.

16:29.670 --> 16:31.770
He thought she would
make an ideal mother.

16:33.274 --> 16:35.514
I'm telling you, this is
everything you're going to need.

16:35.543 --> 16:37.676
It's all in the files.

16:37.712 --> 16:39.111
Thanks, it's always nice when we

16:39.146 --> 16:41.280
don't have to waste time
getting a warrant.

16:41.315 --> 16:43.248
Yeah, well, I may work
for the government,

16:43.284 --> 16:45.351
but I'm not about to let
any red tape get in the way.

16:45.386 --> 16:47.853
Not if I can help you catch
whoever did this.

16:47.888 --> 16:49.488
Mr. Hogan, why don't
you sit down.

16:49.523 --> 16:51.223
Sure.

16:51.258 --> 16:54.827
By the way, you ask me,

16:54.862 --> 16:57.062
I'd take a look
at the Rameys first.

16:57.098 --> 16:59.031
Husband and wife,

16:59.066 --> 17:01.200
had their kid locked
in their attic all winter.

17:01.235 --> 17:03.502
They didn't give a crap about
Jake until we took him away.

17:03.537 --> 17:05.204
The next thing you know,
the husband, Paul,

17:05.239 --> 17:06.472
shows up at our office
with a gun.

17:06.507 --> 17:08.840
I'm assuming you
pressed charges.

17:08.876 --> 17:11.276
This guy Paul's
in jail now, right?

17:11.311 --> 17:13.311
Just got released.

17:13.347 --> 17:17.348
Well, what
about Allison's admirers?

17:17.385 --> 17:20.752
What are you talking about?

17:20.788 --> 17:22.921
Well, I'm wondering if
she had any clients

17:22.957 --> 17:25.691
that spent an inordinate
amount of time with her--

17:25.726 --> 17:27.593
or coworkers
for that matter.

17:27.627 --> 17:29.895
I mean, you knew
her best, right?

17:29.930 --> 17:31.830
I talked to all of
Allison's coworkers,

17:31.866 --> 17:33.432
that's what they
all told me.

17:33.467 --> 17:36.702
They told me how much
you loved Allison.

17:36.737 --> 17:39.438
What do you want from me?

17:39.473 --> 17:42.474
Well, your home computer
would be a good start.

17:42.510 --> 17:44.410
We already have phone
records that show

17:44.445 --> 17:45.711
you called Allison
a great deal,

17:45.746 --> 17:49.415
especially considering
she was married.

17:51.685 --> 17:55.187
All right,
you want my computer, take it.

17:55.222 --> 17:57.022
You'll find plenty on there.

17:57.057 --> 17:59.091
E-mails I probably
shouldn't have sent,

17:59.126 --> 18:00.526
but I swear to God,

18:00.561 --> 18:03.729
I would have never,
ever hurt Allison.

18:08.335 --> 18:10.769
<i>His name is George Gibbons.</i>

18:10.805 --> 18:13.205
The file was, uh,
tagged by the victim's boss.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.507
And, Dr. Hodgins was able
to identify

18:15.543 --> 18:16.642
a hair we found
on the body

18:16.677 --> 18:19.278
as belonging
to a Kurilian Bobtail.

18:19.313 --> 18:21.079
It's an exceptionally
rare breed.

18:21.115 --> 18:23.515
Uh, yeah, that's just one
of the 13 cats that the guy has.

18:23.551 --> 18:25.117
Talk about an unsound mind.

18:25.152 --> 18:27.085
It says here
that Allison rejected him

18:27.121 --> 18:29.822
as a foster parent due
to a criminal record.

18:29.857 --> 18:30.889
Yeah, that's right,
five years ago

18:30.925 --> 18:32.057
he was charged with kidnapping,

18:32.092 --> 18:33.692
but the boy was unharmed.

18:33.727 --> 18:35.727
And he spent the rest
of his time in prison.

18:35.763 --> 18:36.728
It doesn't make any sense.

18:36.764 --> 18:37.796
On multiple occasions

18:37.832 --> 18:39.698
he applied to be
a foster parent.

18:39.733 --> 18:40.999
Why would he think the state

18:41.035 --> 18:43.235
would approve him,
given his record?

18:43.270 --> 18:45.704
My guess is, he knew he
was going to be rejected,

18:45.739 --> 18:47.339
but he kept trying because...

18:47.374 --> 18:49.541
Because he was obsessed
with Allison Monroe.

18:51.145 --> 18:55.747
<i>Well, this is a perfect</i>
<i>location for a serial murderer.</i>

18:55.783 --> 18:57.916
<i>The nearest neighbor is over</i>

18:57.952 --> 18:59.751
a kilometer away,
and given the loudest

18:59.787 --> 19:01.220
a person can scream
is 126 decibels...

19:01.255 --> 19:02.721
You know what, Bones?

19:02.756 --> 19:04.256
Bones, Bones, Bones,
Bones, there are some

19:04.291 --> 19:06.158
word problems that are
not meant to be solved.

19:06.193 --> 19:07.326
You know that.

19:07.361 --> 19:09.628
This is a mess out here.

19:12.299 --> 19:14.433
Ooh, Booth, come here.
What is it?

19:14.468 --> 19:17.135
Do you smell that?

19:17.171 --> 19:18.737
Something is rotten inside.

19:18.772 --> 19:20.372
It could be fetid remains.

19:20.407 --> 19:21.740
You know,
that's probable cause.

19:21.775 --> 19:23.742
Just, just stay behind me,
will you?

19:27.882 --> 19:30.415
Bones, behind me.

19:33.988 --> 19:35.921
Wow.

19:35.956 --> 19:38.690
Cats-- why did it
have to be cats?

19:41.428 --> 19:43.962
Man, what's that smell?

19:43.998 --> 19:45.297
Booth, over there.

19:45.332 --> 19:48.367
I think the smell's
emanating from there.

19:48.402 --> 19:50.002
Okay, just stay behind me.

20:02.850 --> 20:05.851
Hey, more cats.

20:05.886 --> 20:07.753
Do you see anything?

20:07.788 --> 20:09.154
No, just cats.

20:09.189 --> 20:12.958
Cat litter, cat food, cat boxes.

20:16.697 --> 20:18.463
Ooh,

20:19.133 --> 20:21.033
Booth, look.

20:21.068 --> 20:22.167
Yeah.

20:22.202 --> 20:24.570
I-I saw this in photos in the...

20:24.605 --> 20:26.371
...in the case file.

20:26.407 --> 20:27.406
You know what, you're right.

20:27.441 --> 20:30.175
That, that definitely
is Allison's.

20:30.210 --> 20:32.644
Look at the notebook.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.680
Do you think it's
the killer's?

20:34.715 --> 20:36.515
I don't know,
but it looks like it was written

20:36.550 --> 20:38.483
by somebody insane,
that's for sure.

20:40.721 --> 20:41.753
Okay, stay here.

20:41.789 --> 20:42.821
But, Booth...

20:42.856 --> 20:44.923
Just stay here.

21:42.650 --> 21:44.650
Stupid cat.

21:48.656 --> 21:51.657
Don't move.

21:53.009 --> 21:56.162
Okay, just listen to me.

21:56.249 --> 21:57.682
I'm with the FBI.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.184
I'm gonna give you
three seconds.

21:59.219 --> 22:01.286
Give me the gun.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.054
That's not gonna happen.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.489
Drop the knife.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.624
One, two...

22:06.660 --> 22:08.092
You hear that?

22:08.128 --> 22:09.961
It's the cocking of a Colt .45

22:09.996 --> 22:11.496
pointed directly at your head.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.167
Now lower the knife.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.006
You got to be
kidding me, huh.

22:22.042 --> 22:23.608
Thanks, Bones,
I appreciate it.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.176
You know, you're lucky
my partner showed up,

22:25.212 --> 22:27.245
or you would have had
a bullet right in your chest.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.047
Where'd you get the gun?

22:29.082 --> 22:31.983
I don't have one, but I do have
these handy sound files.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.897
I considered going with
the pumped shotgun,

22:34.898 --> 22:37.498
but that seemed like a bit much.
Got to be kidding me.

22:37.534 --> 22:39.334
Will you put that away,
Bones, all right?

22:43.707 --> 22:45.173
Ah, sorry

22:45.208 --> 22:47.475
to interrupt,
but I believe you're standing

22:47.510 --> 22:49.978
in my favorite hiding spot.

22:50.013 --> 22:51.012
I'm not hiding.

22:51.047 --> 22:52.614
I just needed a quiet spot,

22:52.649 --> 22:56.351
so I could plot how to kill
my jerk of a husband.

22:56.386 --> 22:57.518
Well,

22:57.554 --> 22:59.153
if anyone could
get away with it...

22:59.189 --> 23:01.689
Yeah, don't I know it?

23:01.725 --> 23:03.458
How are you holding up?

23:03.493 --> 23:04.726
I heard that Arastoo

23:04.761 --> 23:07.228
turned down that job in Berlin.

23:07.264 --> 23:08.997
Must be strange having him
back here, right?

23:09.032 --> 23:11.165
It is...

23:11.201 --> 23:15.870
but it is also really,
really great.

23:15.906 --> 23:17.672
Hmm.

23:17.707 --> 23:21.709
Well, just be nice to Sebastian
when you give him the news.

23:21.745 --> 23:23.211
Just let him down easy.

23:23.246 --> 23:26.347
I will, if that's
what I choose to do.

23:28.818 --> 23:31.986
Oh, that's Booth.

23:32.022 --> 23:34.889
You want to get out of here?

23:46.803 --> 23:48.202
When you said

23:48.238 --> 23:50.672
getting me out of the office
would do me some good,

23:50.707 --> 23:54.108
I didn't really think that
this was what you had in mind.

23:54.144 --> 23:56.744
Yeah, and what's even more
disturbing is, I'm not seeing

23:56.780 --> 24:00.315
any physical evidence that
Allison Monroe was ever here.

24:00.350 --> 24:02.116
Well, let's keep looking.

24:02.152 --> 24:03.117
There's got to be a torture room

24:03.153 --> 24:05.520
around here somewhere.

24:05.555 --> 24:09.023
Hey, guys, by my count,
we're one cat short.

24:09.059 --> 24:10.591
There should be 13.

24:10.627 --> 24:12.493
Wait, is the Kurilian Bobtail
missing?

24:12.529 --> 24:13.861
You think he ate him?

24:16.399 --> 24:17.699
Oh...

24:17.734 --> 24:19.267
hold on here.

24:20.804 --> 24:22.904
Guys, look at this.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.238
Oh, God, no.

24:24.274 --> 24:25.740
No, thank you, no way,

24:25.775 --> 24:27.141
not even if you pay me.

24:27.177 --> 24:29.210
Wait, what kind
of watch is that?

24:29.245 --> 24:30.311
It looks pretty high-end, right?

24:30.347 --> 24:31.713
Yeah, also totally out of place

24:31.748 --> 24:33.614
considering the state of
everything else around here.

24:33.650 --> 24:35.183
So, maybe it belongs

24:35.218 --> 24:37.185
to our other victim
that hasn't been ID'd yet.

24:38.288 --> 24:40.388
Hey, guys, come check this out.

24:40.423 --> 24:41.889
I think I found something.

24:48.999 --> 24:50.665
What is that?

24:50.700 --> 24:51.666
A video camera?

24:51.701 --> 24:53.067
Where'd you find it?

24:53.103 --> 24:55.536
Yeah, it was hidden
up behind that curtain.

24:55.572 --> 24:57.805
I'll check the house to see
if I can find any more.

24:57.841 --> 25:00.408
So, what, you think
he was videotaping his kills?

25:00.443 --> 25:01.376
Or...

25:01.411 --> 25:03.211
someone was watching him.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.353
<i>Look, Ms. Hobart,</i>
<i>we just need to ask your client</i>

25:12.389 --> 25:14.155
a few questions, that's all.
Yes, and specifically,

25:14.190 --> 25:15.590
I'd like to start
with your journal.

25:15.625 --> 25:16.591
Now, I've read
through it,

25:16.626 --> 25:17.759
and there are tons

25:17.794 --> 25:19.293
of references to blood,

25:19.329 --> 25:20.428
like over a
thousand of them...

25:20.463 --> 25:21.463
He's a serial killer.

25:21.498 --> 25:23.197
No, I hear-- I hear you,
but it was just

25:23.233 --> 25:24.570
a little heavy-handed,
if you know what I mean.

25:24.594 --> 25:25.567
George, look,

25:25.568 --> 25:27.101
I don't care about
the journal. I don't.

25:27.137 --> 25:28.770
That doesn't bother me
right now, just look at me.

25:28.805 --> 25:30.571
Who-who is watching you?

25:30.607 --> 25:32.006
Who are you working with?
Agent Booth,

25:32.042 --> 25:33.374
my client has
already indicated

25:33.410 --> 25:34.375
that he would
like to confess

25:34.411 --> 25:35.810
to Allison
Monroe's murder.

25:35.845 --> 25:37.278
Look, I understand,
but I have questions

25:37.313 --> 25:39.447
that I need answered.
Yes, and just returning

25:39.482 --> 25:40.848
to the blood references
really quickly,

25:40.884 --> 25:42.617
you had a knife
to Agent Booth's throat,

25:42.652 --> 25:43.985
and yet you
didn't use it.

25:44.020 --> 25:46.154
Karen, not now,
please, okay?

25:46.189 --> 25:47.321
George, look at me.

25:47.357 --> 25:49.123
I need to know who
you're working with.

25:49.159 --> 25:50.091
Who's behind this?

25:50.126 --> 25:51.325
Mr. Gibbons,
you are not

25:51.361 --> 25:53.127
required to speak.
George,

25:53.163 --> 25:54.595
George, I know you're scared.
Look at me.

25:54.631 --> 25:56.297
I need to know who
you're working with.

25:56.332 --> 25:57.932
Oh, my God, he didn't do it.

25:58.902 --> 26:00.234
He didn't do it, I can prove it.

26:00.270 --> 26:02.203
I can prove it, I can prove it.

26:02.238 --> 26:03.671
Whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

26:03.706 --> 26:05.873
You suffer from
vasovagal syncope, don't you?

26:05.909 --> 26:08.543
And although you
fantasize about blood,

26:08.578 --> 26:09.530
you simply can't stand
the sight of it, can you?

26:09.554 --> 26:10.578
Put the knife down.

26:10.580 --> 26:12.113
What's happening?
What-what are we do...?

26:12.148 --> 26:13.147
A-Agent Booth,
what's happening?

26:13.183 --> 26:14.215
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, okay...

26:14.250 --> 26:15.783
whoa.

26:16.753 --> 26:19.220
Wow, that worked.

26:19.255 --> 26:19.865
Yeah, hey.

26:19.866 --> 26:21.124
- And ow, ow,
- Yeah, close.

26:21.125 --> 26:22.854
could someone
get me a Band-Aid, please?

26:22.859 --> 26:24.779
Keep your hand up, hand
up high, above your head.

26:26.629 --> 26:29.230
Okay, so we know
the unidentified remains

26:29.265 --> 26:30.531
belong to a black male.

26:30.567 --> 26:32.667
And we know the ulna
measured 31 centimeters,

26:32.702 --> 26:34.802
which gives us a height
of around 180 centimeters.

26:34.838 --> 26:37.672
Okay, so that tells us
he was just under six feet.

26:37.707 --> 26:38.940
That should narrow
things down.

26:38.975 --> 26:40.341
And these missing persons,

26:40.376 --> 26:41.585
they're all strong,
male role models?

26:41.609 --> 26:42.511
Yeah.

26:42.512 --> 26:44.612
Doctors, teachers,
about a dozen vets.

26:44.647 --> 26:45.746
Nothing but alpha males.

26:45.782 --> 26:48.082
Hey, I cleaned off the watch

26:48.118 --> 26:49.717
and I found an engraving.

26:49.752 --> 26:51.319
I had to give it an acid wash,

26:51.354 --> 26:52.987
but at least now
you can read it.

26:53.022 --> 26:56.324
"Love always, G.H.S."

26:56.359 --> 26:57.525
Good, now at least
we have the initials

26:57.560 --> 26:58.960
of whoever gave
our victim the watch.

26:58.995 --> 27:01.362
No, no, not good,
I'm telling you.

27:01.397 --> 27:02.864
There's only five guys
that fit that height,

27:02.899 --> 27:04.732
not one of them has a wife,
kid, or girlfriend

27:04.767 --> 27:06.167
with those initials.

27:06.202 --> 27:07.802
Well, there has to be.
Let's keep looking.

27:07.837 --> 27:09.737
I'm telling you,
it's not here.

27:09.772 --> 27:11.706
What if the initials
didn't belong to a person?

27:11.741 --> 27:13.107
What would they
belong to then?

27:13.143 --> 27:14.876
Not what, where.

27:16.479 --> 27:18.412
Gainesborough High School.

27:18.448 --> 27:19.847
G.H.S.

27:19.883 --> 27:21.749
There-there was a principal
that went missing.

27:21.784 --> 27:23.184
He'd just recently retired.

27:23.219 --> 27:24.752
That must have been why
they got him the watch.

27:24.787 --> 27:26.721
Here, got it.

27:26.756 --> 27:28.055
Douglas Burkhart.

27:28.091 --> 27:29.390
Wife reported him missing

27:29.425 --> 27:30.725
just over a year ago.

27:30.760 --> 27:32.226
Nice work.

27:32.262 --> 27:34.428
Now we finally have a name.

27:39.079 --> 27:40.337
According to the report,

27:40.347 --> 27:42.588
Mr. Burkhart went
missing a year ago.

27:42.589 --> 27:44.822
His body was found
on November 8.

27:44.857 --> 27:46.803
So, consistent
with our killer's M.O.

27:46.804 --> 27:48.537
He lives with the
victim for six months

27:48.572 --> 27:50.172
and then he kills and
disposes of the corpse.

27:50.207 --> 27:51.207
So...

27:51.241 --> 27:52.908
why wait six months?

27:52.943 --> 27:54.776
My best guess is it's
the longest interval

27:54.812 --> 27:56.611
that he can suppress
his desire to kill.

27:56.647 --> 27:57.980
And you're sure that it can't
be this George Gibbons?

27:58.015 --> 27:59.281
No.

27:59.316 --> 28:00.916
Gibbons faints at
the sight of blood.

28:00.951 --> 28:02.768
There's no way he could
taxidermy a body.

28:02.769 --> 28:05.021
So then, how did he get a hold
of Allison Monroe's necklace

28:05.055 --> 28:06.321
and Douglas Burkhart's watch?

28:06.357 --> 28:07.322
Well, I mean

28:07.358 --> 28:08.623
he's involved in some way,

28:08.659 --> 28:10.425
he just did not do
the actual killing.

28:10.461 --> 28:13.295
So, the killer probably
just used him as a way

28:13.330 --> 28:14.663
to help in kidnapping
the victims.

28:14.698 --> 28:16.331
Our killer is smart.

28:16.367 --> 28:18.266
In Gibbons he chose
the perfect accomplice.

28:18.302 --> 28:20.002
Somebody he could
easily manipulate.

28:20.037 --> 28:22.871
Someone who would confess
rather than cross him.

28:22.906 --> 28:24.373
You think, uh,

28:24.408 --> 28:26.942
Gibbons knows
the killer's actual name?

28:26.977 --> 28:29.544
No harm in asking, right?

28:32.049 --> 28:35.484
Hey, you know those
video cameras that I found

28:35.519 --> 28:36.752
at George Gibbons' house?

28:36.787 --> 28:38.320
Yeah, were you able
to trace the feed?

28:38.355 --> 28:39.321
Uh, sort of.

28:39.356 --> 28:40.422
I-I followed the signal

28:40.457 --> 28:41.823
to a remote terminal,

28:41.859 --> 28:44.226
but the problem is,
the line was still

28:44.261 --> 28:45.560
hooked to a
routing station.

28:45.596 --> 28:47.295
So, the killer could
have accessed the feed

28:47.331 --> 28:48.463
from virtually anywhere?

28:48.499 --> 28:51.466
Yeah, and that's
not the worst of it.

28:51.502 --> 28:55.337
The cameras were still
transmitting when I found them,

28:55.372 --> 28:57.506
which means the killer

28:57.541 --> 28:58.707
could have been watching

28:58.742 --> 29:00.008
when Booth and Brennan
came to the house.

29:00.044 --> 29:01.777
Or when you and I were there
with Aubrey.

29:01.812 --> 29:02.778
Yeah.

29:02.813 --> 29:04.146
So, that means there is

29:04.181 --> 29:05.881
a very distinct possibility

29:05.916 --> 29:07.883
that this very sick individual

29:07.918 --> 29:10.252
could know exactly who we are.

29:16.593 --> 29:18.393
<i>Sorry, Mrs. Burkhart,</i>
<i>but we just</i>

29:18.429 --> 29:20.629
can't share any more information
about the investigation.

29:20.664 --> 29:22.697
But still, you're certain
the remains you found

29:22.733 --> 29:24.399
belonged to my husband?

29:24.435 --> 29:26.935
Yes, ma'am.

29:26.970 --> 29:30.305
So, he didn't run off
with some student of his?

29:30.340 --> 29:31.406
No, actually,

29:31.442 --> 29:32.774
we-we think that
he was targeted

29:32.810 --> 29:34.876
because he was such
an honorable, good man.

29:38.115 --> 29:40.215
What can I do to help?

29:40.250 --> 29:43.552
Your husband, did he ever
mention a social worker

29:43.587 --> 29:46.188
by the name of, uh,
Allison Monroe?

29:46.223 --> 29:47.255
Here's a picture of her.

29:47.291 --> 29:48.857
No, did she

29:48.892 --> 29:50.559
work with Douglas
over at Gainesborough?

29:50.594 --> 29:52.127
Not that we're aware of.

29:52.162 --> 29:54.029
Also, there's a-a
George Gibbons,

29:54.064 --> 29:55.497
he owned a farm
in Somerset County.

29:55.532 --> 29:58.033
No, I'm sorry,
I've never seen him.

29:58.068 --> 30:00.068
Can you think of any enemies
that your husband had?

30:00.104 --> 30:01.403
Did-did he get any threats?

30:01.438 --> 30:03.839
Maybe from a student
that he threw out?

30:03.874 --> 30:05.907
No, Gainesborough was
a good school.

30:05.943 --> 30:08.043
There were no gangs, or...

30:08.078 --> 30:09.811
nothing like that.

30:09.847 --> 30:13.748
Okay, well, uh,
thank you again for coming in.

30:13.784 --> 30:14.983
No, Agent Booth, please,

30:15.018 --> 30:17.586
don't stop.

30:17.621 --> 30:21.289
For my husband, I need to find
a way I can help.

30:27.865 --> 30:29.764
Thank you.

30:29.800 --> 30:33.535
On Douglas Burkhart's remains,
I'm not seeing cause of death.

30:33.570 --> 30:34.636
In my initial exam,

30:34.671 --> 30:36.171
I never found
anything definitive.

30:36.206 --> 30:37.472
My assumption was,
I was missing

30:37.508 --> 30:39.574
key evidence
due to predation.

30:39.610 --> 30:41.176
What about the
other victim?

30:41.211 --> 30:42.911
So far, I'm not seeing any

30:42.946 --> 30:45.247
perimortem damage,
aside from these drill holes,

30:45.282 --> 30:47.516
which were likely
the result of torture.

30:47.551 --> 30:48.884
Given the pain
she must have endured,

30:48.919 --> 30:50.886
it's conceivable
she died of shock.

30:50.921 --> 30:52.187
Well, I agree that's possible,

30:52.222 --> 30:54.322
but it's not what
my tox screen is saying.

30:54.358 --> 30:56.358
What did you find?

30:56.393 --> 30:57.759
Propofol...

30:57.794 --> 30:58.960
and Succinylcholine.

30:58.996 --> 31:00.395
That doesn't make sense.
Those are drugs

31:00.430 --> 31:01.930
you would use if
you wanted someone to die

31:01.965 --> 31:03.298
a relatively peaceful death.

31:03.333 --> 31:05.066
Our killer drilled holes
into his victims.

31:05.102 --> 31:06.401
It's completely random.

31:06.436 --> 31:09.104
First, he brutally
tortures his victims.

31:09.139 --> 31:11.273
Then he shows compassion
in killing them.

31:11.308 --> 31:13.308
Then, six months later,
he smashes in their skulls.

31:20.350 --> 31:22.083
George, no one
is gonna believe

31:22.119 --> 31:23.818
that you killed
anyone, okay?

31:23.854 --> 31:25.020
Now, do yourself a favor,

31:25.055 --> 31:26.421
give us a name and then

31:26.456 --> 31:27.389
you and I can start talking

31:27.424 --> 31:28.657
about a reduced sentence.

31:28.692 --> 31:32.661
George, tell them
what you know.

31:32.696 --> 31:35.163
No. No, no, no, I can't.

31:35.199 --> 31:39.434
He said if I talked,
he would kill Charley.

31:39.469 --> 31:40.535
Who is Charley?

31:40.571 --> 31:41.571
A friend?

31:41.605 --> 31:44.739
Yes, Charley is my best friend.

31:44.775 --> 31:47.008
He's one of your cats, isn't he?

31:47.044 --> 31:51.012
He-he-he took Charley
the last time,

31:51.048 --> 31:52.747
when I messed up.

31:52.783 --> 31:54.049
Messed up, how?

31:54.084 --> 31:57.285
He-he told me to find him a mom,

31:57.321 --> 32:00.155
but i-it couldn't
lead back to me.

32:00.190 --> 32:02.891
But you knew
Allison Monroe, didn't you?

32:02.926 --> 32:05.093
I-I messed up.

32:05.128 --> 32:06.361
George, listen to me.

32:06.396 --> 32:07.862
Give us a name,

32:07.898 --> 32:09.497
and I will do everything I can

32:09.533 --> 32:10.699
to get Charley back.

32:10.734 --> 32:12.534
No.

32:12.569 --> 32:14.436
You don't understand.

32:14.471 --> 32:15.904
He's smart.

32:15.939 --> 32:17.672
He's smarter than anybody.

32:18.809 --> 32:21.876
If I talk, he'll know.

32:21.912 --> 32:23.578
Okay.

calling you for an hour.

33:44.100 --> 33:45.366
You're not picking up the phone...
I'm sorry.

33:45.402 --> 33:47.335
I got preoccupied dressing

33:47.370 --> 33:49.604
and rearticulating the remains.

33:49.639 --> 33:51.172
Why?
To hopefully

33:51.208 --> 33:52.273
gain insight
into the killer's mind.

33:52.309 --> 33:53.641
I don't think
that's a good idea.

33:53.677 --> 33:55.510
You don't want to get
into this killer's head.

33:55.545 --> 33:57.278
I don't know if I can help it.

33:57.314 --> 33:59.814
In a way, he and I
are very similar.

33:59.850 --> 34:02.250
Stop right there.
You're not very similar, okay?

34:02.285 --> 34:03.451
Look at the
victim, Booth.

34:03.487 --> 34:04.652
What do you see?

34:04.688 --> 34:06.521
Just bones, right?
Yeah.

34:06.556 --> 34:09.123
Well, the killer lived
with the remains,

34:09.159 --> 34:11.960
and when he looked at them,
he didn't see a skeleton.

34:11.995 --> 34:13.360
He saw...

34:13.396 --> 34:16.231
a living person
he could interact with,

34:16.266 --> 34:17.998
and that's what I see as well.

34:18.034 --> 34:20.635
Bones, the killer
is completely insane.

34:20.670 --> 34:22.270
He's a lunatic.
Come on, let me take you home.

34:22.304 --> 34:23.237
No.

34:23.273 --> 34:24.706
No, given the killer's M.O.,

34:24.741 --> 34:27.775
it is very likely
he is out there looking

34:27.811 --> 34:29.511
for his next victim as we speak.

34:29.545 --> 34:31.379
You're not taking
responsibility for all this.

34:31.414 --> 34:32.847
Booth,
if we hadn't quit our jobs...

34:32.882 --> 34:34.549
Allison Monroe still
would have been killed.

34:34.583 --> 34:36.150
No, I don't believe that.

34:36.186 --> 34:39.587
Given our track record,
it is statistically more likely

34:39.623 --> 34:42.090
that she would still be alive.

34:45.295 --> 34:48.362
Okay, fine.

34:48.398 --> 34:49.364
What-what do you need?

34:49.399 --> 34:50.632
What is it?
Nothing.

34:50.667 --> 34:53.201
Just time to...

34:54.571 --> 34:58.239
...to reexamine
the remains and...

34:58.275 --> 34:59.874
challenge my own findings.

34:59.910 --> 35:02.577
For instance...

35:02.612 --> 35:04.913
do you see this
flaking here?

35:04.948 --> 35:06.047
That is called spalling.

35:06.082 --> 35:07.515
It only occurs

35:07.551 --> 35:09.918
when the bone has been
disturbed postmortem.

35:09.953 --> 35:13.321
So, the holes...

35:13.356 --> 35:14.656
don't indicate torture.

35:14.691 --> 35:16.958
Well, that's one
possible scenario.

35:18.695 --> 35:24.465
As you can see, I have collected
a large number of screws that

35:24.501 --> 35:26.601
fit in the allotted holes,

35:26.636 --> 35:27.769
but I...

35:27.804 --> 35:29.904
I-I don't see what purpose

35:29.940 --> 35:31.706
the killer would have
in using them.

35:35.745 --> 35:37.378
You're missing
something here, hold on.

35:37.414 --> 35:39.280
W-What do you see?

35:39.316 --> 35:41.583
What I see is that you don't
have the right screw here.

35:41.618 --> 35:44.619
All right, the killer is
very manipulative, right?

35:44.654 --> 35:46.254
So, you know the screw

35:46.289 --> 35:47.589
with the little circle on top,

35:47.624 --> 35:49.023
the little
fish-eye screw...

He was turning his victims
into marionettes.

37:57.987 --> 38:00.021
Hey, there you are.

38:00.056 --> 38:01.255
Hey, did
Agent Booth call you?

38:01.291 --> 38:02.590
Yeah, but there's
something else.

38:02.625 --> 38:04.459
I know how we can
get Gibbons to talk.

38:04.494 --> 38:06.060
I just need an hour
alone with him.

38:06.096 --> 38:07.862
I need to prove to him that
we're not like the killer...

38:07.897 --> 38:09.230
Gibbons is dead.

38:10.533 --> 38:12.300
Hanged himself

38:12.335 --> 38:13.335
in his cell.

38:13.369 --> 38:15.470
Guards just found him.

38:25.682 --> 38:26.682
Hey.

38:26.716 --> 38:27.882
I was wondering if you know

38:27.917 --> 38:28.917
where Dr. Brennan is.

38:28.952 --> 38:29.917
Right now,

38:29.953 --> 38:30.985
I'd say she's probably

38:31.020 --> 38:32.386
pulling into her driveway.

38:32.422 --> 38:33.921
So, I take it
you're leaving as well?

38:33.957 --> 38:36.057
I was considering it,
but to be honest,

38:36.092 --> 38:37.625
the thought
of an empty house

38:37.660 --> 38:38.926
kind of creeps me out right now.

38:38.962 --> 38:39.927
I understand.

38:39.963 --> 38:41.062
Must be frightening,

38:41.097 --> 38:42.497
the idea that this killer

38:42.532 --> 38:44.632
may have seen you on video.

38:46.970 --> 38:51.005
Any chance I could, uh, maybe
talk you into driving me home?

38:51.040 --> 38:52.940
Of course,
and if it would help,

38:52.976 --> 38:54.308
I could stay as long
as you like.

38:54.344 --> 38:56.410
Or, what I mean is,

38:56.446 --> 38:59.480
I could stay at least until
Sebastian is able to join you.

38:59.516 --> 39:01.816
Well, that may be a while,

39:01.851 --> 39:05.620
'cause I've decided I'm not
going to be seeing him anymore.

39:06.523 --> 39:08.823
I see.

39:12.362 --> 39:15.429
So...

39:15.465 --> 39:16.798
are you ready?

39:38.955 --> 39:40.221
Is Christine okay?

39:40.256 --> 39:42.123
Yeah, she's sleeping
like a baby.

39:42.158 --> 39:45.560
Whew, turns out that
Aubrey's advice did the trick.

39:45.595 --> 39:47.295
What exactly
did you say?

39:47.330 --> 39:49.263
Well, I told her,
you know,

39:49.299 --> 39:51.766
if she's scared, you just go
right up to the closet,

39:51.801 --> 39:53.768
and you tell the monster,
"If you don't stop,

39:53.803 --> 39:56.204
my Dad is gonna put a cap in
your butt."

39:56.239 --> 39:57.805
No, you did not, Booth.

39:57.841 --> 39:59.173
Come on, I'm joking, all right?
It's all good.

39:59.209 --> 40:00.541
Looks like you need a drink.

40:02.445 --> 40:03.878
Yes.
Okay.

40:03.913 --> 40:07.014
I would like that, thank you.
Okay, all right.

Booth, what was that?

41:25.361 --> 41:28.229
I don't know, hold on.

41:28.264 --> 41:29.563
Christine?

41:31.034 --> 41:33.935
Christine?
Christine?

41:33.970 --> 41:36.103
Christine?

41:36.139 --> 41:38.039
Christine?

41:38.074 --> 41:39.540
Christine...
Sweetie.

41:39.575 --> 41:40.775
Where are you?

41:40.810 --> 41:41.976
She was just here.

41:42.011 --> 41:43.611
No, this is not happening.
Christine!

41:43.646 --> 41:45.680
Look.

41:52.155 --> 41:53.988
Please don't be mad, Mommy.

41:54.023 --> 41:54.956
What, Christine?
Oh...

41:54.991 --> 41:56.357
Sweetie...

41:56.392 --> 41:57.658
you're okay.

42:03.833 --> 42:06.534
I'm sorry I broke
my snow globe.

42:06.569 --> 42:08.836
I was only trying to do
what Daddy told me.

42:08.871 --> 42:09.804
And when I opened the door,

42:09.839 --> 42:11.539
it fell along

42:11.574 --> 42:13.607
with a bunch
of my stuffed animals.

42:13.643 --> 42:14.675
That's okay,
don't worry about it.

42:14.711 --> 42:15.676
No one's mad at you.

42:15.712 --> 42:16.644
Daddy's right.

42:16.679 --> 42:17.812
I was just a little worried.

42:17.847 --> 42:18.980
Why?

42:19.015 --> 42:20.147
You were right, Mommy.

42:20.183 --> 42:21.482
There are no monsters.

42:21.517 --> 42:22.650
See?

42:24.687 --> 42:27.555
I'm always right.
