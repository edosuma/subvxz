WEBVTT

00:01.420 --> 00:03.141
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:03.151 --> 00:06.019
- So he's your boyfriend?
- Why do you care?

00:06.087 --> 00:07.721
Well, you two must not be from around here.

00:07.789 --> 00:08.789
He's talking to you, Nancy.

00:08.856 --> 00:10.223
Uhh!

00:10.292 --> 00:11.357
I just found out I'm gonna be playing

00:11.425 --> 00:13.726
- in that festival.
- That's so awesome.

00:13.795 --> 00:16.629
Pull Deacon Claybourne's name
from the list of performers.

00:16.697 --> 00:19.632
If we really are a thing,
we have to tell Scarlett.

00:21.068 --> 00:22.435
I can't believe I'm in
this battle with Jeff.

00:22.503 --> 00:23.703
You guaranteed me a buyout,

00:23.771 --> 00:25.438
and unfortunately, you failed to deliver.

00:25.506 --> 00:26.572
Well, would you like to know

00:26.640 --> 00:28.174
why Charlie and Olivia Wentworth split up?

00:28.241 --> 00:30.476
Two words... Juliette Barnes.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074

00:40.020 --> 00:42.322
What you're doing for
the city is just so great.

00:42.389 --> 00:43.356
You can say that to Mayor Conrad.

00:43.424 --> 00:44.489
It was all his idea.

00:44.557 --> 00:46.258
Yeah, well, none of this
would have come together

00:46.326 --> 00:47.693
without Juliette's hard work.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.161
She's wonderful, isn't she?

00:49.229 --> 00:50.162
And, thank you, Councilwoman Burke.

00:50.230 --> 00:51.463
- I appreciate it.
- Thank you.

00:51.531 --> 00:53.332
Thank you.

00:53.399 --> 00:55.201
- Thank you, guys. Thank you.
- Hey, listen, I really do mean that.

00:55.268 --> 00:56.568
Thank you for all of this.

00:56.636 --> 00:58.103
If you hadn't agreed to come on board,

00:58.171 --> 00:59.939
we never would have connected
with Charlie Wentworth,

01:00.006 --> 01:02.240
and this probably never
would have happened.

01:02.308 --> 01:03.842
- It's my pleasure.
- All right.

01:03.909 --> 01:04.909
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

01:04.977 --> 01:06.044
- Yes.
- Okay. Bye.

01:06.111 --> 01:07.346
Hey, thank y'all for coming.

01:07.413 --> 01:08.814
We'll see you at the
opening ceremony tomorrow.

01:10.282 --> 01:12.584
Absolutely.

01:12.652 --> 01:13.585
Down at the other end.

01:13.653 --> 01:14.653
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:14.721 --> 01:16.455
- Welcome home.
- Yeah.

01:16.522 --> 01:17.588
What are you doing here?

01:17.656 --> 01:19.190
Uh, just dropping off my guitars

01:19.258 --> 01:21.259
for our show tomorrow night.

01:21.327 --> 01:23.094
Well, thank you for
agreeing to play with me.

01:23.162 --> 01:24.428
Yeah. What happened to Brian?

01:24.496 --> 01:25.864
I thought he was playing the festival.

01:25.931 --> 01:27.398
I gave him a few days off.

01:27.466 --> 01:30.701
You know, he had a couple
tours back-to-back, so...

01:30.769 --> 01:33.604
- You're not complaining, are ya?
- Not at all.

01:34.806 --> 01:36.674
You know, I, uh, tried to call you

01:36.742 --> 01:38.876
a couple times when I got your voice-mail.

01:38.943 --> 01:40.010
Everything okay?

01:40.078 --> 01:42.613
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Juliette Barnes!

01:42.681 --> 01:45.015
- We hear you're to blame for the Wentworth separation.
- Move back!

01:45.083 --> 01:46.250
Hey, come on, man.

01:46.317 --> 01:47.752
- Hey, right over here.
- Hey, back up!

01:47.819 --> 01:49.119
You and Charlie were together in Houston

01:49.187 --> 01:51.955
- at the Wentworth 5th anniversary party.
- Let her through.

01:52.023 --> 01:54.958
- How's it feel to be a home wrecker?
- Go! Go!

01:56.761 --> 01:57.727
Back up.

01:57.795 --> 01:59.396
How about you, Mr. Mayor?

01:59.463 --> 02:01.198
Any thoughts on the fact
that the face of your festival

02:01.266 --> 02:02.532
is a tramp?

02:05.303 --> 02:07.036
Look what just got here.

02:07.104 --> 02:09.372
- Well, look at that. We look good together.
- It looks pretty good.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.441
- I think so, too.
- We should duet more often.

02:11.509 --> 02:13.175
I hope you're ready for
all these early mornings

02:13.243 --> 02:14.611
we got with this big radio
tour we got coming up.

02:14.678 --> 02:16.178
Yeah, I'm... I am up for anything

02:16.246 --> 02:17.647
as long as it means I
get to hang out with you.

02:17.715 --> 02:18.815
I like this, you know,

02:18.883 --> 02:20.116
workin' with my girlfriend thing.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.584
Oh, girlfriend, huh?

02:21.652 --> 02:23.485
- What?
- Well, I don't know if my kids are ready

02:23.553 --> 02:25.955
- for me to have a boyfriend.
- Well, what about you?

02:26.023 --> 02:28.824
Fair enough. I'll...

02:28.892 --> 02:30.293
no, hey, I'll be your dirty little secret.

02:30.360 --> 02:31.394
I like it that way.

02:31.461 --> 02:32.995
Mmm.

02:33.063 --> 02:34.730
Oh, hey, listen, I was, uh,

02:34.798 --> 02:36.832
golfing with Jeff Fordham this morning.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.100
Oh, God. Did you lose a bet?

02:38.168 --> 02:40.268
Easy. Uh, and he said something about

02:40.336 --> 02:42.571
marketing strategy for your album launch.

02:42.639 --> 02:43.839
What album launch?

02:43.907 --> 02:45.674
I got the distinct impression

02:45.742 --> 02:46.708
he's planning on releasing it

02:46.776 --> 02:48.143
right on the heels of this single.

02:48.210 --> 02:50.245
I just, you know, wanted
to give you a heads-up.

02:50.313 --> 02:51.880
I don't know what kind of promises

02:51.948 --> 02:52.948
Jeff Fordham has made to you,

02:53.015 --> 02:54.249
but I hope you've collected on 'em,

02:54.317 --> 02:57.152
'cause I'm about to go over
to Edgehill and kill him.

02:59.788 --> 03:01.022
Look, I'm sorry.

03:01.090 --> 03:02.657
I know you're mad, but we need to be able

03:02.724 --> 03:03.758
to talk about this.

03:03.826 --> 03:05.860
What do you want me to do, beg?

03:05.928 --> 03:08.529
I was gonna tell you
about Gunnar in St. Louis,

03:08.597 --> 03:10.398
but you were upset about being on the road,

03:10.466 --> 03:11.899
and I didn't want to make that worse.

03:11.968 --> 03:13.968
I don't want to hurt
you. Neither does Gunnar.

03:14.035 --> 03:17.472
Please.

03:17.539 --> 03:18.706
I've barely talked to him.

03:18.774 --> 03:20.307
I told him I need to
work things out with you.

03:20.375 --> 03:22.276
Would you just look at me?

03:28.083 --> 03:30.884
Hey, what do you think about this one?

03:30.952 --> 03:32.786
It looks good.

03:39.794 --> 03:41.695
I have an idea. What if, um...

03:41.762 --> 03:44.631
what if I just go like this?

03:44.699 --> 03:45.799
It looks good.

03:45.867 --> 03:48.434
Hey!

03:48.503 --> 03:49.970
I'm practically dancing
around in my underwear here,

03:50.037 --> 03:51.638
and you're not even paying attention.

03:51.706 --> 03:52.906
What's going on?

03:52.974 --> 03:56.042
I don't care to talk much about clothes.

03:58.779 --> 04:01.781
I'd rather talk without 'em.

04:04.584 --> 04:06.019
- And I got yours right here.
- Thank you.

04:06.086 --> 04:07.020
All right.

04:07.087 --> 04:08.321
- Hey.
- Deacon!

04:08.389 --> 04:10.056
As I live and breathe.

04:10.124 --> 04:12.258
I saw your name on the list the other day.

04:12.326 --> 04:13.326
How are you doin', Tanya?

04:13.394 --> 04:14.494
Excited to see you out there.

04:14.561 --> 04:15.728
- I'm excited to be playing.
- Yeah?

04:15.795 --> 04:16.928
Yeah.

04:16.997 --> 04:18.964
You know what? It must
have gotten misplaced,

04:19.031 --> 04:20.533
- but I'll just call the office.
- Okay.

04:21.668 --> 04:23.669
- Hey, man.
- Hey!

04:23.737 --> 04:24.837
- How are you doin'?
- I'm good.

04:24.905 --> 04:25.871
Good. Where is Deacon Claybourne's packet?

04:25.939 --> 04:27.239
Name?

04:27.306 --> 04:28.674
- Uh, Gunnar Scott.
- Okay, great.

04:28.742 --> 04:30.543
- Are you playing this thing, too?
- That's what they tell me.

04:30.610 --> 04:31.810
- Nice.
- You?

04:31.878 --> 04:33.779
Yeah, uh, Jeff Fordham pulled some strings.

04:33.847 --> 04:36.014
- Thank you.
- Oh. Friends in high places, huh?

04:36.082 --> 04:37.349
Apparently.

04:37.417 --> 04:38.716
I'll tell him.

04:38.784 --> 04:40.185
Paul says you're not on the list.

04:40.253 --> 04:42.020
That doesn't make any sense.

04:42.088 --> 04:43.355
- You saw my name yourself, right?
- Yeah.

04:43.423 --> 04:45.257
Uh, last-minute changes
somewhere really high up.

04:45.324 --> 04:47.059
But I can call around for you.

04:47.126 --> 04:48.326
No, that's all right. All right?

04:48.394 --> 04:49.361
I... I think I know what happened.

04:49.429 --> 04:51.430
- Thank you.
- Okay.

04:51.497 --> 04:53.330
Hey, I got a question.

04:53.398 --> 04:55.934
So if the main stage is zone 1,

04:56.001 --> 04:59.437
they got me at zone 8.
You... you know where that is?

05:01.006 --> 05:02.406
What?

05:06.045 --> 05:07.979
On the plus side, if you
need to use the bathroom...

05:08.047 --> 05:09.113
That's not funny.

05:09.181 --> 05:11.915
Yeah, well, at least you got a spot.

05:11.983 --> 05:15.186
Great. Only cost me one
of my favorite songs.

05:16.321 --> 05:18.456
Jeff wanted it for will Lexington...

05:18.523 --> 05:22.259
In return for a great
place at the festival.

05:22.327 --> 05:24.295
Yeah, "with a bunch of
label execs in the audience

05:24.362 --> 05:26.763
who might want to sign you, Gunnar."

05:26.831 --> 05:29.600
I doubt they will be
down here at 11:00 A.M.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.468
Yeah, I don't expect they will be.

05:31.535 --> 05:35.138
Welcome to the club of the rejected.

05:35.206 --> 05:37.074
Why? What did Jeff to do you?

05:37.141 --> 05:40.844
Not Jeff. Somebody else just
playing personal politics.

05:40.912 --> 05:43.179
I'm just lookin' for a break, man.

05:43.247 --> 05:45.348
Tell me about it.

05:45.416 --> 05:48.818
How about you and me partner up?

05:48.885 --> 05:49.986
What do you mean?

05:50.053 --> 05:52.688
Inside of these fences,

05:52.756 --> 05:54.257
they can tell us where we play...

05:54.325 --> 05:55.425
if we play.

05:55.493 --> 05:58.360
But right outside...

05:58.428 --> 06:00.096
they can't tell us a damn thing.

06:03.399 --> 06:05.134
You would think after 42 unanswered calls,

06:05.201 --> 06:07.169
she'd get the message
and just leave me alone.

06:07.237 --> 06:09.438
Gunnar called, what, 14 times.

06:09.506 --> 06:10.706
What is he, like,

06:10.774 --> 06:12.541
three-times less sorry or somethin'? Did...

06:12.609 --> 06:14.309
did you know anything about this?

06:14.377 --> 06:16.145
Did she say anything on
the trip to St. Louis?

06:16.212 --> 06:19.615
- I know she only came to see him. But...
- Nobody said anything to me.

06:19.682 --> 06:22.117
Why do you care so much?

06:22.185 --> 06:23.218
It's because it's Gunnar?

06:23.286 --> 06:25.320
You think he's the only reason I care?

06:25.388 --> 06:27.689
Seems to me you broke up
with him, he's moved on,

06:27.757 --> 06:30.159
- and you're... a little pissed.
- No.

06:30.226 --> 06:33.028
That's not what it is at all.

06:33.095 --> 06:35.063
And I'm sorry. I've been home 12 hours,

06:35.131 --> 06:37.365
- and all I've done is complain.
- Well...

06:37.432 --> 06:38.767
I might have to give you something else

06:38.834 --> 06:40.434
to complain about...

06:40.502 --> 06:42.603
Juliette wants me to play
the festival with her.

06:42.672 --> 06:44.839
And...  our sound check

06:44.907 --> 06:46.875
- is during your show.
- That's okay.

06:46.942 --> 06:48.742
You heard me before. It's good.

06:48.810 --> 06:51.312
Well, how about this...

06:51.380 --> 06:53.614
tomorrow night, after I play,

06:53.682 --> 06:54.848
late night date night?

06:54.916 --> 06:57.652
You are so cute. Yes.

06:57.719 --> 07:02.089
Look, I know things have
been kinda weird lately,

07:02.157 --> 07:04.758
but... I really missed you

07:04.826 --> 07:07.527
- while you were gone.
- I missed you, too.

07:11.933 --> 07:14.735
"TMZ" picked it up, "Radar."

07:14.803 --> 07:16.203
Ugh. "Perez Hilton."

07:16.270 --> 07:19.272
Am I just never supposed
to work with a married man?

07:19.340 --> 07:21.441
I mean, I was with Mayor Conrad today.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.410
Does that mean rumors are
gonna start up about us, too?

07:23.477 --> 07:24.777
Okay, so what do you want to do?

07:24.845 --> 07:27.113
It's a rumor, okay? It's not like

07:27.181 --> 07:29.749
some sex tape is suddenly
comin' to light here.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.686
If I had to comment on every
absurd story out there...

07:32.753 --> 07:35.088
this isn't just some absurd story, honey.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.789
What are you trying to say, Glenn?

07:36.857 --> 07:39.092
- Huh? That these rumors have merit?
- Okay,

07:39.159 --> 07:41.894
it's just a rumor. But look...

07:41.962 --> 07:43.696
they're still one of the
world's most idolized couples,

07:43.764 --> 07:46.099
and you're you, and... look, even though

07:46.166 --> 07:48.400
country music might like a cheating song,

07:48.468 --> 07:50.903
the audience has never
much liked the cheater...

07:50.971 --> 07:52.438
I mean, even an alleged one.

07:52.505 --> 07:53.772
We can't just sit here and ignore this

07:53.840 --> 07:55.807
and hope that it goes away.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.209
How long will it take for you to find out

07:57.277 --> 07:58.410
who started this rumor?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.078
I...  look, who knows?

08:00.146 --> 08:02.715
All right, well, your new full-time job

08:02.782 --> 08:05.150
is to turn that "who
knows" into an "I know."

08:05.218 --> 08:07.319
You're right. This is never gonna stop

08:07.387 --> 08:10.421
unless the tabloids have
somebody to rip to shreds.

08:10.489 --> 08:13.524
So I'll talk to the press, but when I do,

08:13.592 --> 08:17.262
I'll give 'em another target to shoot at.

08:17.329 --> 08:20.232
Hey, Jeff.

08:20.299 --> 08:21.833
I found you. Rayna.

08:21.901 --> 08:23.635
Housekeeper let me in. She's a big fan.

08:23.702 --> 08:25.703
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.171
I hear that you're gonna screw me over

08:27.239 --> 08:28.839
- and try to release that album.
- You wanna meet me,

08:28.907 --> 08:30.341
you call my office, make an appointment.

08:30.409 --> 08:31.442
I've been calling your office all day.

08:31.510 --> 08:32.777
They've been giving me the runaround.

08:32.844 --> 08:34.145
We talk about this now.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.318
I'll make this easy. I ran the numbers,

08:41.386 --> 08:43.254
and that duet single is
not gonna make my quarter.

08:43.321 --> 08:45.222
Oh, so you're doing this 'cause
your quarterly spreadsheet?

08:45.290 --> 08:46.791
Oh, we all answer to someone, Rayna.

08:46.858 --> 08:50.360
Now... right after I launch this new duet,

08:50.428 --> 08:52.362
I'm putting out an album
anchored by the duet

08:52.430 --> 08:53.864
and featuring the best
tracks of you and Liam.

08:53.932 --> 08:56.433
You can't just drop tracks off the album.

08:56.501 --> 08:57.902
That album is complete.

08:57.969 --> 09:00.203
- People don't care about albums.
- I care about albums!

09:00.271 --> 09:01.905
That's what I created.
That's what I believe in.

09:01.972 --> 09:03.106
You can't just hack that up

09:03.174 --> 09:04.708
because you want to try to exploit the fact

09:04.776 --> 09:06.310
that I was almost killed in a car accident!

09:06.377 --> 09:08.144
You know what? You're unbelievable here.

09:08.212 --> 09:09.479
What... what don't you get?

09:09.547 --> 09:11.481
Okay, those masters do not belong to you.

09:11.549 --> 09:12.783
Bottom line...

09:12.850 --> 09:15.385
I need a Rayna Jaymes album to be released

09:15.453 --> 09:16.719
or a check for $20 million.

09:16.787 --> 09:20.389
What? No sassy comeback this time?

09:22.126 --> 09:29.221
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

09:36.083 --> 09:37.216
The album that Jeff wants me to make

09:37.284 --> 09:38.384
has nothing to do with
the album that I made

09:38.451 --> 09:40.019
and everything to do with the fact

09:40.087 --> 09:42.255
- that I had a car accident.
- But you're still under contract with him.

09:42.322 --> 09:44.556
Thank you. Well, he said,

09:44.624 --> 09:46.759
"album or check."

09:46.927 --> 09:49.295
If I bring him a check for $20 million,

09:49.363 --> 09:51.130
then I own Highway 65 and my album.

09:51.593 --> 09:53.927
Well, you have yourself. You have Scarlett.

09:53.995 --> 09:55.128
- And I know I need more artists than that.
- Yes.

09:55.196 --> 09:57.230
You know, I'm gonna go to Teddy's festival

09:57.298 --> 09:59.766
and try to find more
acts, but I need money.

09:59.834 --> 10:03.503
I mean, I have some cash flow
after the tour with Juliette.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.172
But it's just... it's not gonna be enough.

10:05.239 --> 10:07.373
Okay, I've been thinking about jumping back

10:07.441 --> 10:08.708
into the business world.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.710
And I know that I don't
have daddy's kind of money,

10:10.778 --> 10:13.813
but do you think $3
million could maybe buy me

10:13.880 --> 10:15.648
a corner office at Highway 65?

10:15.716 --> 10:17.517
You sure you wanna do that?

10:17.584 --> 10:19.452
Look, I don't know a thing
about the music business,

10:19.520 --> 10:21.887
but I do know how to run a company.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.857
You can take care of that.
I can take care of the other.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.659
I would love to be in business with you.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.393
Well, I don't know if
you're really gonna say that

10:28.461 --> 10:31.063
once I start yelling at you
about balancing your books.

10:31.311 --> 10:32.744
Well, we're not there yet,
'cause, hate to say it,

10:32.812 --> 10:35.547
we need a lot more than $3 million.

10:37.950 --> 10:39.084
What do you think this
house would be worth?

10:39.152 --> 10:40.386
No.

10:40.453 --> 10:42.954
People go bankrupt by
gambling everything they have

10:43.023 --> 10:44.322
on risky start-ups.

10:44.390 --> 10:46.658
Now the first rule of business is

10:46.726 --> 10:48.493
you never risk everything you have.

10:50.763 --> 10:52.096
Hello?

10:52.164 --> 10:53.665
Hey.

10:53.733 --> 10:54.966
Uh, Scarlett isn't here, is she?

10:55.034 --> 10:57.502
Uh, no, no. She already
went down to the festival.

10:57.570 --> 10:59.437
- Why, you need her? I can get her for you.
- Oh, no, it's all good.

10:59.505 --> 11:00.538
Okay.

11:00.605 --> 11:02.340
So look, uh...

11:02.408 --> 11:04.409
I was thinkin' we do
this late tonight, okay?

11:04.476 --> 11:05.943
We're down at the riverfront stage...

11:06.011 --> 11:07.078
it's right there.

11:07.146 --> 11:08.746
We'll wait till that headliner is done.

11:08.813 --> 11:10.714
There'll be a ton of
people. We'll be good to go.

11:10.782 --> 11:12.016
I just... I just have one question.

11:12.084 --> 11:14.018
Um, is... is this even legal?

11:14.086 --> 11:15.920
Not completely.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.256
Look, you want that 11:00 A.M. slot

11:19.323 --> 11:20.958
at toilet town, you go ahead and take it.

11:21.026 --> 11:22.392
But if you're willing to work around

11:22.460 --> 11:23.961
- the letter of the law just a little bit...
- All right. Okay.

11:24.029 --> 11:25.395
- Okay, but I... I don't get it.
- All right.

11:25.463 --> 11:26.764
Why... why do you want to involve me?

11:26.831 --> 11:29.466
Well, uh, I don't think
me, uh, hanging up flyers

11:29.534 --> 11:31.268
is gonna work as well as it used to.

11:31.335 --> 11:33.270
- You do that tweetering thing, right?
- Tweeting.

11:33.337 --> 11:36.039
Well, I barely text, so
I need you to do that.

11:36.807 --> 11:37.640
Look, you said that

11:37.708 --> 11:40.210
Jeff was gonna bring you
some label types, right?

11:40.278 --> 11:41.678
I got some friends I can call...

11:41.745 --> 11:44.081
some A&R guys. I'll have 'em come on down.

11:44.148 --> 11:46.550
Hell, I'll open for you.

11:46.617 --> 11:47.684
- Yeah, well, that's great, man.
- All right, good.

11:47.751 --> 11:49.453
I... I just... I just don't get it.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.788
You can play for Rayna, for...
for Juliette, for anybody.

11:51.855 --> 11:54.090
Not with this hand.

11:54.157 --> 11:56.726
Besides, you know what?

11:56.794 --> 11:58.628
I think I'm done being on the side.

11:58.696 --> 12:00.663
I want to be out front a little bit.

12:02.700 --> 12:05.167
How could you possibly
think it would be a good idea

12:05.235 --> 12:06.768
for you to come to this house?

12:06.836 --> 12:08.904
- Oh, I gotta go pick up, uh...
- We're... we're just talking about...

12:08.972 --> 12:10.506
No, no, no, I don't
care what you were doing.

12:10.574 --> 12:11.640
I care that you're doing it here.

12:11.708 --> 12:15.244
Look, I'm sorry. All right? Zoey's sorry.

12:15.312 --> 12:17.146
But you can't take this personally

12:17.214 --> 12:18.247
'cause, actually, it's
got nothing to do with you.

12:18.315 --> 12:19.781
My ex is sleeping with my best friend

12:19.849 --> 12:21.250
and I can't take this personally?

12:21.318 --> 12:23.885
You think this is some
let's-gang-up-on-Scarlett thing?

12:23.953 --> 12:26.287
Well, it's not, okay? I like her.

12:26.355 --> 12:28.690
I really like her.

12:28.758 --> 12:31.192
Please, get out.

12:31.260 --> 12:32.861
Great, thanks, John.

12:32.929 --> 12:34.663
Now, look, I'm happy she's
planning on laying low,

12:34.731 --> 12:36.832
but let's double security
wherever Juliette Barnes

12:36.899 --> 12:38.767
is gonna be, so she can do just that, okay?

12:38.835 --> 12:40.935
- Hey!
- Hi. Dad, this is so awesome!

12:41.003 --> 12:42.537
O.M.G., is that Layla Grant?

12:42.605 --> 12:44.071
Dad, we have to go over there. Please?

12:44.140 --> 12:45.306
- Yes, it is. Of course, go. Go.
- Oh, my gosh.

12:45.374 --> 12:48.610
Looks like you've done a good job.

12:48.632 --> 12:49.865
What do you think the chances are

12:49.933 --> 12:52.168
the press focuses on that
and not the P.R. challenges

12:52.236 --> 12:53.269
my headliner's facing?

12:53.337 --> 12:54.837
I've been putting out fires all morning.

12:54.905 --> 12:57.239
- Yeah, you know what? I coulda warned you about that.
- Thank you.

12:57.307 --> 12:58.841
- Hey!
- Ready to go, Mr. Mayor?

12:58.909 --> 13:00.409
- Yeah, I am.
- Hey, Rayna.

13:00.477 --> 13:02.277
Hi. Girls, come on, let's go!

13:02.345 --> 13:04.747
Come on, let's go. All right, see ya.

13:04.815 --> 13:06.448
- Let's go. All right.
- Bye.

13:06.516 --> 13:09.018
Come on, sweetie.

13:09.086 --> 13:10.185
Hey, everybody!

13:10.253 --> 13:11.520
Thanks for being here today.

13:11.588 --> 13:14.689
- Where's Juliette?
- Uh, Juliette... she's very busy

13:14.757 --> 13:16.125
getting ready for the
festival's opening night,

13:16.192 --> 13:18.960
but she is very excited about
what we put together here.

13:19.028 --> 13:20.729
I'm just thrilled to be
up here with my family

13:20.796 --> 13:23.198
to welcome y'all to the
first... and hopefully annual...

13:23.266 --> 13:25.066
music city music festival.

13:25.135 --> 13:27.369
- I'd like to start off by thanking all of our sponsors.
- Rayna, I love you!

13:27.437 --> 13:29.604
Hey, Will!

13:30.906 --> 13:33.541
So legal was able to deal
with those guys from Houston

13:33.609 --> 13:35.376
who were threatening to press charges.

13:35.444 --> 13:38.179
Well, that's great. Thanks, man.

13:38.247 --> 13:40.782
I saw pictures of 'em.

13:40.850 --> 13:43.151
They were the guys harassing me and Craig.

13:43.218 --> 13:46.020
Yeah, and how are things, uh...

13:46.087 --> 13:48.156
- going with you and Craig?
- It's not.

13:49.158 --> 13:51.058
He wasn't my type.

13:52.894 --> 13:54.995
How's it going with you and Layla?

13:55.063 --> 13:58.199
Just great. My type across the board.

13:59.768 --> 14:02.202
Let's take some pictures together.

14:02.270 --> 14:04.872
Hey, y'all have met my
boyfriend Will Lexington, right?

14:10.578 --> 14:12.112
I am the face of this festival,

14:12.180 --> 14:14.648
and I practically just snuck
in through a basement window.

14:14.716 --> 14:15.783
Well, you're the one who wanted no press

14:15.850 --> 14:16.884
before you have a name.

14:16.951 --> 14:18.485
I understand the strategy.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.320
It doesn't mean I have
to be happy about it.

14:20.388 --> 14:24.057
You avoiding the madness, too?

14:24.124 --> 14:27.026
It seemed like a wise choice.

14:27.094 --> 14:28.928
Glenn, can you give us a minute, please?

14:32.333 --> 14:33.833
Tell me it wasn't you.

14:33.901 --> 14:35.234
Tell me that this isn't part of some

14:35.302 --> 14:37.369
crazy plan to get me back.

14:37.437 --> 14:39.271
No, you ended it. I'm respecting that.

14:39.339 --> 14:41.473
- Was it Olivia?
- No, she'd be mortified

14:41.541 --> 14:42.641
to be anything less than perfect

14:42.710 --> 14:43.776
in the eyes of the press.

14:43.844 --> 14:46.145
You gotta keep up appearances, right?

14:46.213 --> 14:48.948
Right. But my family is giving me pressure.

14:49.016 --> 14:50.717
They'd like nothing more
than for this whole thing

14:50.784 --> 14:53.085
- to just... disappear.
- That's amazing.

14:53.152 --> 14:56.222
I actually do have something
in common with your people.

14:56.289 --> 14:57.489
Mm.

14:57.557 --> 15:01.960
So if it wasn't you or
I, and it wasn't Olivia...

15:02.028 --> 15:04.062
I have a few ideas.

15:06.199 --> 15:07.199
- Hey, y'all.
- Hey.

15:07.267 --> 15:09.101
How are ya? Good to see you.

15:09.168 --> 15:10.702
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

15:10.770 --> 15:12.204
Hey, I'm... I'm really
sorry that you're having...

15:12.271 --> 15:13.438
To deal with all this crazy press stuff.

15:13.505 --> 15:15.006
Were you the one who lied to the tabloids

15:15.074 --> 15:16.441
and told them I was having an affair

15:16.508 --> 15:18.810
- with Charlie Wentworth?
- No. Why would you think that?

15:18.878 --> 15:21.479
Would you just give it a rest?

15:21.547 --> 15:25.283
This little innocent act
is gettin' pretty damn old.

15:25.351 --> 15:27.485
Well, I'm only 19, so...

15:27.553 --> 15:28.586
it's not really an act.

15:28.654 --> 15:30.821
I just meant that it must be hard...

15:30.889 --> 15:32.390
when you've been doing it for so long...

15:32.458 --> 15:35.926
to, uh, not be paranoid 'cause
you've made so many enemies.

15:51.012 --> 15:52.179
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:52.246 --> 15:55.248
Uh, so I got your message. I just wanna say

15:55.316 --> 15:56.950
- I don't wanna fight you.
- Fight me?

15:57.018 --> 15:59.086
You're not pissed about the Scarlett thing?

15:59.153 --> 16:00.920
- 'Cause I can explain everything...
- No, I heard enough this morning.

16:00.989 --> 16:03.456
All right? So... unless
you cheated on her...

16:03.524 --> 16:04.824
- No.
- Good.

16:04.892 --> 16:05.992
Then we got a show to do.

16:06.059 --> 16:08.595
We'll talk about that later... as in never.

16:08.662 --> 16:10.062
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:10.130 --> 16:14.667
I mean, of all the times,
you decide not to weigh in?

16:14.735 --> 16:17.003
Giving out free advice is kinda your thing.

16:18.972 --> 16:20.973
- Is that right?
- Well...

16:21.041 --> 16:23.142
Y... yeah, uh, yeah... it is.

16:23.210 --> 16:26.278
You want some free advice?
Don't crap where you eat.

16:26.346 --> 16:28.481
That's your free advice.

16:28.548 --> 16:30.716
- Okay, well, can you just talk to her, please?
- Did you miss the part

16:30.783 --> 16:32.184
- where I said I wasn't gonna get involved?
- No.

16:32.252 --> 16:33.585
- 'Cause it was an important...
- Not... not for me.

16:33.653 --> 16:35.821
For... for Zoey. I don't want
Scarlett to give up on her.

16:35.889 --> 16:38.757
Yeah, well, that's a nice sentiment, but...

16:38.825 --> 16:40.559
I think I'm gonna just let
y'all work this thing out.

16:40.627 --> 16:42.528
Okay? 'Cause we got a show to do here.

16:42.595 --> 16:44.696
Now this lot belongs to
an old friend of mine.

16:44.764 --> 16:48.000
He likes underdogs, so he
shut it down so we can use it.

16:48.067 --> 16:49.835
It's kinda missing a stage, though.

16:49.903 --> 16:52.504
Yeah, well, I'll handle my end of things,

16:52.571 --> 16:54.739
you handle yours.

16:54.806 --> 16:57.742
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go see Scarlett play.

16:57.809 --> 17:01.346
I recommend you don't join me.

17:01.414 --> 17:02.813
- Boo!
- Oh, my!

17:02.881 --> 17:05.483
Hi, darlin'.

17:05.550 --> 17:06.851
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:06.919 --> 17:08.318
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

17:08.386 --> 17:09.753
I didn't wanna miss Scarlett,
didn't wanna miss you.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.521
I was a little afraid
you wouldn't talk to me,

17:11.589 --> 17:13.523
seeing as I'm fully dressed

17:13.592 --> 17:15.560
and not near a swimming pool, but...

17:15.627 --> 17:16.993
Did Jeff Fordham tell you that?

17:17.021 --> 17:18.489
Good lord, y'all are inseparable.

17:18.557 --> 17:20.625
No, look, he's just worried you might be

17:20.692 --> 17:23.060
sabotaging yourself a little bit.

17:23.127 --> 17:24.728
He's worried or you're worried?

17:24.795 --> 17:26.195
Okay, I admit it. I'm worried.

17:26.263 --> 17:27.564
This is something I have wanted to do

17:27.632 --> 17:29.466
for a very long time.

17:29.534 --> 17:31.768
I am gonna buy myself out of this label,

17:31.836 --> 17:32.903
come hell or high water.

17:32.970 --> 17:35.539
Why? Labels are great, Rayna.

17:35.606 --> 17:37.707
They take care of all the business crap

17:37.775 --> 17:40.110
so we can play music and
travel all around the world.

17:40.178 --> 17:41.444
Hell, they make us a lot of money.

17:41.512 --> 17:43.847
Well, yeah, but it's more than just money.

17:43.915 --> 17:45.849
- Is it?
- Yeah.

17:45.917 --> 17:47.584
I'm kiddin'.

17:47.652 --> 17:48.919
- You're taking this too seriously, darlin'.
- No, I'm not taking it too se...

17:48.986 --> 17:50.353
listen, this is important to me.

17:50.421 --> 17:52.889
This is what I love. This is my career.

17:52.957 --> 17:54.591
Okay, what are you gonna do
when you buy yourself out?

17:54.659 --> 17:57.393
You gonna build your
whole label up from scratch

17:57.461 --> 17:58.861
with one artist... Scarlett?

17:58.929 --> 18:00.629
You know I think she's great,
but you think she's ready

18:00.697 --> 18:01.997
to carry half a label on her shoulders?

18:02.066 --> 18:04.200
I know that I need more artists.

18:04.268 --> 18:07.036
And let's not forget, your
best buddy Jeff Fordham

18:07.104 --> 18:08.471
poached will Lexington from me.

18:08.539 --> 18:10.639
Now hang on a sec. Rayna,
he's not my best buddy.

18:10.707 --> 18:12.075
- He is a businessman.
- Well...

18:12.142 --> 18:13.576
that's not the way I like to do business.

18:13.643 --> 18:15.210
Okay, look, you know what?

18:15.278 --> 18:17.379
Your career, not mine.

18:17.447 --> 18:19.048
Do you need anything from me?

18:19.115 --> 18:21.450
I mean, I could, you know, help you invest,

18:21.517 --> 18:24.219
- get you started.
- Well, I think that might be a little complicated, but...

18:24.287 --> 18:25.320
Hello.

18:25.388 --> 18:26.388
Look at you.

18:26.456 --> 18:28.857
You look fierce, girl.

18:28.925 --> 18:30.459
Thank you. I have a fantastic role model.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.461
- How are you?
- I'm good. Go get 'em.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.129
- I will. Thank you.
- I'll see you in a minute.

18:34.197 --> 18:35.363
- Knock 'em dead, hon.
- I know.

18:35.431 --> 18:36.898
... Scarlett O'Connor!

18:36.966 --> 18:38.833
Hey, Nashville,

18:38.901 --> 18:40.969
it is so good to be back
on this beautiful day.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.104
Let's have some fun.

18:42.171 --> 18:44.038
Okay, you're right.

18:44.107 --> 18:46.108
She is pretty special.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.428
Any word on who started this rumor?

18:50.495 --> 18:51.896
These reporters aren't
going to reveal their source.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.631
They are not reporters, okay?

18:53.699 --> 18:54.999
They are tabloid scum.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.801
Whatever they are, nobody's talking,

18:56.869 --> 18:58.235
not even for the usual incentives.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.171
It was that little twit Layla.

19:00.238 --> 19:02.774
I'm telling you, in can feel it in my gut.

19:02.841 --> 19:05.242
I cannot believe after
bringing her on tour,

19:05.310 --> 19:07.078
that she'd end up being so two-faced.

19:07.145 --> 19:10.281
- Go find me a name, please.
- All right.

19:10.348 --> 19:12.049
That's a pretty big
accusation you're making there.

19:12.117 --> 19:13.951
You got any evidence to support it?

19:14.018 --> 19:15.752
Not yet, but I will.

19:15.820 --> 19:18.089
Try not to mess up this good
thing you got going here.

19:18.156 --> 19:20.624
Fans can turn on you.
Then where would you be?

19:20.692 --> 19:22.893
My fans have stood by me through more than

19:22.961 --> 19:25.762
a made-up sex scandal, but
thank you for the pep talk.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.731
And hey, next time you visit me

19:27.799 --> 19:29.232
a few hours before I take the stage

19:29.300 --> 19:31.635
to sell albums that benefit your company,

19:31.703 --> 19:33.436
you might wanna go with...

19:33.504 --> 19:36.339
- "Break a leg."
- I'm just saying, handle this carefully,

19:36.407 --> 19:38.241
or the tabloids will eat you alive.

19:38.309 --> 19:39.542
I'm well aware.

19:39.610 --> 19:42.378
They've been snackin'
on me my entire career.

19:47.518 --> 19:50.019
So you didn't revoke
the passes you gave me.

19:50.087 --> 19:51.378
That must mean that deep down,

19:51.379 --> 19:52.370
- you really wanted to see me...
- Hey!

19:52.371 --> 19:53.923
- Hey!
- That was so great.

19:53.991 --> 19:55.825
Thanks. It's really nice
to be back in Nashville.

19:55.892 --> 19:58.160
- Yeah, I bet. Hey, Zoey.
- Hey, Deacon.

19:58.228 --> 20:01.296
- Scarlett, can we just...
- I'm gonna come and see your... your set later.

20:01.364 --> 20:02.464
Okay.

20:07.237 --> 20:08.403
Look, I don't want to get in the middle

20:08.471 --> 20:09.605
of whatever soap opera
y'all got going here,

20:09.672 --> 20:10.939
- but...
- Then don't.

20:11.007 --> 20:12.674
All I know is you've been
best friends for 20 years.

20:12.742 --> 20:14.075
That's gotta mean something.

20:14.144 --> 20:16.778
You got some fans here.

20:16.846 --> 20:18.647
Okay.

20:18.714 --> 20:20.616
Hi! How are you?

20:20.683 --> 20:21.356
I'll catch up with you.

20:21.357 --> 20:22.831
- Can I have your autograph, Scarlett?
- Okay.

20:22.835 --> 20:24.019
- You having a good day?
- Yeah.

20:24.086 --> 20:25.521

21:04.125 --> 21:05.993
No, not that spot he was doing tomorrow.

21:06.061 --> 21:07.161
He's playing here tonight.

Oh, honey, I don't think your
dad would appreciate that.

This is his big weekend.

21:14.002 --> 21:15.868
Okay, they made up after
that fight they had.

21:15.936 --> 21:17.537
My dad told me.

21:17.605 --> 21:19.005
I really wanna go.

21:19.073 --> 21:20.807
And I said, "no."

21:20.874 --> 21:23.009
Look, I know this family...

21:23.077 --> 21:24.311
is complicated. But...

21:24.378 --> 21:26.546
What do you mean, "complicated"?

21:26.614 --> 21:27.847
I think you know what I mean.

I thought you would be the one person

22:39.584 --> 22:40.785
who always had my back.

22:40.852 --> 22:43.387
I got yours.

22:43.454 --> 22:44.621
Isn't that what we promised each other

22:44.689 --> 22:47.357
when I left town?

22:47.425 --> 22:49.726
I know we handled telling you poorly.

22:49.794 --> 22:52.962
But this isn't just a fling.

22:53.030 --> 22:54.331
I really like him.

22:54.399 --> 22:57.167
I do remember the promise we made.

22:57.234 --> 22:59.002
We said we wouldn't let
anything come between us...

22:59.069 --> 23:02.839
not time, not distance, not a boy.

23:02.907 --> 23:05.241
Can you see that this
is not just about a boy?

23:05.309 --> 23:07.410
It's about you and I.

23:07.477 --> 23:10.180
You told me you'd changed
when you came to town.

23:10.247 --> 23:13.116
Maybe I was really stupid to
expect you to come here and...

23:13.184 --> 23:14.950
and be my best friend,

23:15.018 --> 23:16.652
even though you're the
only part of my childhood

23:16.720 --> 23:19.188
that I want to remember. Don't say that.

23:19.255 --> 23:21.990
We've always been friends.
We're always gonna be friends.

23:22.058 --> 23:23.025
Well, I would be a terrible friend

23:23.092 --> 23:25.461
if I didn't tell you that...

23:25.529 --> 23:28.698
being the good girl suited
you a whole lot better.

23:28.765 --> 23:29.998
You hurt less people.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.003
Thank you.

23:35.071 --> 23:36.504
Uh, Rayna. Rayna, you got a minute?

23:36.572 --> 23:37.973
Oh, no, I don't.

23:38.041 --> 23:39.474
Look, I just want to apologize
for our encounter last night.

23:39.542 --> 23:40.675
I might have come off a little harsher

23:40.743 --> 23:42.444
than I intended. Rayna, stop!

23:42.511 --> 23:43.678
Stop it. Rayna, please.

23:43.746 --> 23:46.481
Look... I was an ass, okay?

23:46.549 --> 23:48.182
Look, I know we've had our difficulties,

23:48.250 --> 23:50.117
but just... would you listen?

23:50.185 --> 23:52.854
I feel like you're just gonna
try to smooth over something

23:52.921 --> 23:54.322
so that I will let you

23:54.390 --> 23:55.657
release the album you wanna release.

23:55.725 --> 23:57.325
- It's not gonna happen.
- I feel like you deserve

23:57.393 --> 23:59.894
to know why I wanna make
these changes to your album.

23:59.962 --> 24:02.497
- What's this?
- It's market research.

24:02.565 --> 24:03.931
Oh. I didn't just make the call

24:03.999 --> 24:05.967
to dump those tracks arbitrarily.

24:06.034 --> 24:08.369
The ones I wanna lose aren't
registering with your audience,

24:08.436 --> 24:10.905
and there's no hit single to launch it all.

24:10.973 --> 24:12.473
The album is not gonna sell.

24:12.540 --> 24:13.640
Numbers don't lie.

24:13.708 --> 24:14.675
Well, see, there's a difference

24:14.743 --> 24:16.510
between you and me, Jeff.

24:16.578 --> 24:19.046
You think music is all about the numbers.

24:19.114 --> 24:21.849
You've probably been so busy
with all your materials here,

24:21.916 --> 24:23.917
you haven't even listened
to the album, have you?

24:23.985 --> 24:26.286
So you'll forgive me if I
don't give that much credence

24:26.354 --> 24:29.155
- to your "research."
- Read it.

24:29.223 --> 24:31.157
I know you think I'm the bad guy,

24:31.225 --> 24:32.259
but I'm not.

24:44.417 --> 24:46.051
Keep comin'. Y'all watch out back there.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.352
All right, right there! Right there!

24:47.420 --> 24:48.353
That's good! That's good!

24:48.421 --> 24:50.521
Mr. Mayor, officers,

24:50.589 --> 24:51.722
it's gonna be a great night, right?

24:51.790 --> 24:53.057
We're shutting you down.

24:53.124 --> 24:54.559
Hmm. Shutting what down?

24:54.626 --> 24:55.626
You can't just put a show up here

24:55.694 --> 24:57.161
because you feel like it.

24:57.228 --> 24:58.429
- You don't have the permits for it.
- Well, the funny thing is...

24:58.497 --> 25:01.098
is that, uh, the guy that
owns this private property,

25:01.166 --> 25:02.399
he says I can...

25:02.468 --> 25:04.469
which is real fortunate,
since somehow I just recently

25:04.536 --> 25:06.070
lost my spot at your little festival.

25:06.137 --> 25:07.905
You want to arrest me, you go ahead.

25:07.973 --> 25:09.173
I'll be more than happy to tell everybody

25:09.240 --> 25:11.408
what a hospitable mayor we got.

25:11.476 --> 25:13.777
I'm gonna have officers
stationed right here.

25:13.845 --> 25:16.447
One thing goes sideways,
one person gets hurt,

25:16.514 --> 25:19.483
one complaint, and I'm holding
you personally responsible.

25:21.419 --> 25:23.854
Go.

25:30.194 --> 25:32.328
Mayor Conrad,

25:32.396 --> 25:33.396
I just want to apologize

25:33.464 --> 25:34.931
if these rumors are causing any trouble.

25:34.999 --> 25:36.399
Of course, Mr. Wentworth.

25:36.467 --> 25:38.835
I'm sure it's all just vicious lies.

25:38.903 --> 25:40.036
No blood, no foul.

25:40.104 --> 25:42.972
Get out there and kick some ass.

25:43.040 --> 25:45.008
Don't I always?

25:52.149 --> 25:54.750
Y'all ready to have a good night?

You asked, so I made the call.

27:12.810 --> 27:15.178
And I had the bank lock you
in to a low-interest rate,

27:15.246 --> 27:16.880
but it's still gonna be tight.

27:16.948 --> 27:18.915
Is it gonna get me what I need?

27:18.983 --> 27:20.751
Well, if you mortgage the house

27:20.818 --> 27:22.184
and liquidate all your stocks,

27:22.253 --> 27:24.254
that's gonna get you just north of 15.

27:24.321 --> 27:26.822
That plus my buy-in and...

27:26.890 --> 27:29.024
everything you made on tour
with Juliette last year,

27:29.092 --> 27:31.093
will get you to 20.

27:33.464 --> 27:36.132
Jeff Fordham gave me all
this marketing research,

27:36.199 --> 27:37.367
which I don't even wanna look at.

27:37.434 --> 27:39.135
But, you know, it does make me realize,

27:39.202 --> 27:41.503
man, I'm leveraging everything for this.

27:41.571 --> 27:42.537
- I mean, it's a...
- Yep.

27:42.605 --> 27:45.941
- It's a risk, you know?
- Yeah, it is.

27:47.644 --> 27:49.145
Would you do it if you were in my position?

27:49.212 --> 27:51.713
No.

27:51.782 --> 27:53.215
But then, I went to business school.

27:53.283 --> 27:55.250
And you became a country music star.

27:55.318 --> 27:56.985
I probably wouldn't have bet on you

27:57.052 --> 27:58.720
having the career that you've already had.

27:58.788 --> 27:59.821
But here's the thing...

27:59.889 --> 28:02.391
I'm not the one who's making the bet.

28:02.458 --> 28:04.293
Mom, I'm, like, so dizzy right now.

28:04.360 --> 28:05.427
Hello.

28:05.495 --> 28:06.762
Y'all did it!

28:06.829 --> 28:09.097
You rode on the ferris
wheel. You ready to go home?

28:09.165 --> 28:12.801
No. Mom, I really want to go
and see Deacon perform tonight.

28:12.868 --> 28:14.435
But Peggy said, "no," because she's a...

28:14.503 --> 28:17.338
Okay. Well, I thought Deacon
was playing tomorrow, y'all.

28:17.406 --> 28:19.140
No. I mean, there must
have been a change of plans

28:19.208 --> 28:21.642
'cause it's happening, like, soon.

28:21.710 --> 28:25.346
That was so unfair.

28:25.414 --> 28:27.182
Tell me that you have a name.

28:27.249 --> 28:29.550
- Juliette...
- All I asked you for was one thing,

28:29.618 --> 28:31.452
and you can't even do that?!

28:36.425 --> 28:38.326
I wouldn't.

28:40.429 --> 28:41.595
If you try to tell me

28:41.663 --> 28:43.331
that was nothing to get upset over,

28:43.398 --> 28:45.199
I will literally come over there

28:45.266 --> 28:48.235
and rip your face off.

28:49.971 --> 28:51.538
Actually, I thought it was pretty terrible.

28:56.311 --> 28:59.980
But...

29:00.048 --> 29:02.982
you kept going.

29:03.050 --> 29:06.353
And at least we came out the other side.

29:06.420 --> 29:08.388
Thank you.

29:10.458 --> 29:13.526
I am so screwed.

29:13.594 --> 29:15.462
My fans turned on me.

29:15.529 --> 29:18.731
I can't avoid the press for much longer.

29:18.798 --> 29:21.800
All I needed was a name...

29:21.869 --> 29:24.636
just somebody to put the blame on.

29:24.704 --> 29:29.575
He was gonna leave his wife for me.

29:29.642 --> 29:31.410
And I ended it.

29:31.478 --> 29:32.778
I thought it wouldn't be a big deal,

29:32.846 --> 29:34.546
'cause nobody would have to know.

29:34.614 --> 29:36.448
Did you love him?

29:36.516 --> 29:38.617
It was never about that.

29:38.685 --> 29:41.453
It wasn't about...

29:41.521 --> 29:44.456
anything. It was just dumb.

29:46.926 --> 29:49.294
And I was wrong.

29:51.197 --> 29:53.564
- You think I'm a terrible person, don't you?
- No.

29:53.632 --> 29:55.833
Not at all.

29:57.502 --> 30:01.105
Listen, you might have to go out there

30:01.172 --> 30:02.907
and face the press,

30:02.974 --> 30:06.176
but that doesn't mean you
have to play their game.

30:12.050 --> 30:14.651
Hey. Hey. What happened?

30:14.719 --> 30:15.919
Talk to me.

30:15.986 --> 30:18.455
My best friend just broke up with me.

30:18.523 --> 30:20.056
She's gonna come around, okay?

30:20.124 --> 30:21.958
Not as long as we're together, she won't.

30:22.026 --> 30:25.128
Look, I know how much your
friendship with Scarlett means to you.

30:25.195 --> 30:27.898
And I get it if...

30:27.965 --> 30:29.999
you need to take some time
to work that out, but...

30:30.067 --> 30:32.101
I don't know what I need right now.

30:32.169 --> 30:34.103
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

30:57.627 --> 30:58.994
I gotta go.

31:14.714 --> 31:16.615
Mayor Conrad, Charles Wentworth, and I

31:16.682 --> 31:18.517
have been working tirelessly for months

31:18.585 --> 31:21.720
to make this weekend a
great one for Nashville.

31:21.787 --> 31:24.556
I think that's what y'all
should talk about, not me.

31:24.624 --> 31:26.791
And the only comment
you're gonna get from me

31:26.859 --> 31:29.127
or my people is "no comment."

31:29.194 --> 31:31.362
Just tell us if it's true.

31:31.430 --> 31:33.431
No.

31:33.499 --> 31:35.033
I'm done handing out headlines.

31:35.101 --> 31:36.835
My private life is just that...

31:36.902 --> 31:38.870
private and mine.

31:38.938 --> 31:40.338
- Thank you.
- Juliette, come on. We just wanna...

31:41.641 --> 31:43.307
I know that's not what we discussed,

31:43.375 --> 31:47.578
but there's no making lemonade
out of "no comment," so...

31:47.646 --> 31:48.946
This is gonna be hell.

31:49.014 --> 31:51.949
We're gonna get through this together.

31:53.785 --> 31:56.120
- Hey, Jeff!
- Hey.

31:56.188 --> 31:57.855
- What a great festival, right?
- Yeah.

31:57.922 --> 31:58.922
Yeah, did you get to see will?

31:58.990 --> 32:00.257
He was amazing.

32:00.324 --> 32:03.994
Sadly, I missed it. I'm...
dealing with a few things.

32:04.062 --> 32:05.796
Right, yeah.

32:05.864 --> 32:08.165
Such a shame, what's
happening with Juliette.

32:08.232 --> 32:10.300
Trouble seems to follow her
around everywhere, doesn't it?

32:10.368 --> 32:12.002
And what would you know about that?

32:12.070 --> 32:13.103
Oh, just what I've read.

32:13.171 --> 32:14.337
Between you and me,

32:14.405 --> 32:15.772
she kind of deserves
what she's been getting.

32:15.839 --> 32:17.374
Hmm.

32:17.441 --> 32:20.677
Not that you had anything to do
with that story becoming public.

32:20.744 --> 32:23.246
Me? No. Why would you think that?

32:23.314 --> 32:24.981
- I would never...
- Juliette Barnes might not be perfect,

32:25.049 --> 32:26.949
but I have years worth of
albums and singles from her

32:27.017 --> 32:28.318
that are very important to Edgehill.

32:28.386 --> 32:30.587
If I find out that you had anything to do

32:30.655 --> 32:32.021
with this story coming out,

32:32.089 --> 32:33.823
your contract will be in serious jeopardy.

32:33.891 --> 32:35.357
There will be another runner-up

32:35.425 --> 32:37.126
on "American Hitmaker" next year.

32:40.731 --> 32:43.199

Hey.

Uh, it went good.

35:30.267 --> 35:32.235
Hey, Jeff.

35:32.302 --> 35:33.936
I got good news for ya.

35:34.004 --> 35:35.171
- You read the research.
- No.

35:35.239 --> 35:37.974
I'm gonna have a check
for you for $20 million

35:38.041 --> 35:39.342
first thing Monday morning.

35:39.410 --> 35:41.710
I'm buying myself, my
album, and Highway 65,

35:41.778 --> 35:44.046
out of Edgehill... full price.

35:44.114 --> 35:45.882
And how far did you have to
go to find someone to back you?

35:45.949 --> 35:46.983
Not far.

35:47.050 --> 35:49.551
- I'm backing myself.
- It's a mistake...

35:49.619 --> 35:51.420
betting on an album and a baby artist,

35:51.488 --> 35:52.621
neither of which has what it takes.

35:52.689 --> 35:53.956
That's where you're wrong.

I've made millions before,
and I'm gonna do it again.

- Hey.

36:07.704 --> 36:08.871
You did it, didn't you?

36:08.938 --> 36:10.138
Yeah, I just did.

36:10.206 --> 36:13.008
- Wow. Bold move.

- Not a can of worms I'd wanna open,

36:15.411 --> 36:17.913

36:17.980 --> 36:19.781

36:19.848 --> 36:21.983
seeing as it's Edgehill?

36:22.051 --> 36:23.885

37:31.502 --> 37:32.768
your budding solo career.

37:32.836 --> 37:33.969
We can do that.

That video of you and the media

38:14.253 --> 38:16.021
went viral pretty quick, didn't it?

38:16.089 --> 38:18.556
I thought you'd just deny it.

38:18.625 --> 38:20.692
Sorry if that threw a wrench into

38:20.760 --> 38:22.594
you trying to get back with Olivia.

38:22.662 --> 38:24.029
I just couldn't...

38:24.097 --> 38:26.364
stand up there and lie anymore.

38:26.432 --> 38:28.699
No. I'm not upset.

38:28.767 --> 38:30.602
I'm going ahead with the divorce,

38:30.669 --> 38:32.537
in spite of what my family think's best.

38:32.605 --> 38:36.274
If I stay with Olivia, I'll be miserable.

38:36.342 --> 38:38.109
And that's no way to live, is it?

38:38.177 --> 38:41.546
No, it isn't.

38:41.614 --> 38:42.780
Thank you.

38:42.848 --> 38:45.482
Well, that's the last thing

38:45.550 --> 38:47.451
I would expect you to say to me.

38:47.519 --> 38:50.755
Well, I wouldn't be
making changes to my life

38:50.822 --> 38:54.424
if it wasn't for you opening
up my eyes to possibility...

38:54.492 --> 38:57.928
making me see the world
a little differently.

38:59.364 --> 39:02.232
I'm sorry I couldn't do that for you.

39:02.300 --> 39:04.668
But I hope you find
someone someday who can.

39:04.735 --> 39:07.337
Me, too.

39:11.075 --> 39:12.576
- Hey, Gunnar, you were great.
- Thank you.

39:12.644 --> 39:13.810
- Amazing show.
- I appreciate it.

39:13.878 --> 39:17.513
Thanks, guys. See you again.

39:19.449 --> 39:20.516
Great show.

39:20.584 --> 39:22.686
Thank you.

39:22.753 --> 39:25.321
Scarlett's been my best friend forever.

39:25.389 --> 39:27.824
But if she was really my friend,

39:27.892 --> 39:31.494
she would see how happy I
am, and she'd be happy for me.

39:33.129 --> 39:37.633
She made the wrong choice
when she broke up with you.

39:37.701 --> 39:39.368
I'm not gonna make the same mistake.

39:47.511 --> 39:48.543
Hello?

39:52.248 --> 39:54.349
Will?

40:34.656 --> 40:36.023
The last few months have been really crazy,

40:36.091 --> 40:39.627
and I know that I've
made a lot of mistakes.

40:39.694 --> 40:42.496
But when Charlie told me that he loved me,

40:42.564 --> 40:44.798
I realized that...

40:44.866 --> 40:48.001
all I want is to be a person...

40:48.069 --> 40:49.436
who gets to say "I love you"

40:49.504 --> 40:51.972
and really mean it.

40:52.039 --> 40:54.540
- So...
- Juliette.

40:54.608 --> 40:57.577
- Hi.
- Scarlett.

40:57.645 --> 40:59.813
Hey.

40:59.881 --> 41:02.382
I'm so sorry.

41:02.449 --> 41:05.852
I just came to thank Avery.

41:05.920 --> 41:08.354
So... thank you.

41:09.757 --> 41:12.258
Juliette...

41:20.000 --> 41:22.001
- Hey, Rayna.
- Hey.

41:22.068 --> 41:23.903
- Where are the girls?
- Oh, they went home with Tandy

41:23.970 --> 41:24.904
just a little while ago.

41:24.971 --> 41:26.306
Hey, listen, um...

41:26.373 --> 41:28.240
I know it was your week to have them.

41:28.308 --> 41:30.375
So thank you for letting
them spend the day with us.

41:30.443 --> 41:31.777
- We... we really had a good time with them.
- We did.

41:31.845 --> 41:33.279
Yeah, I thought it went really well.

41:33.346 --> 41:35.547
All right, well, good night.

41:35.615 --> 41:36.849
- Bye.
- Good night.

41:36.917 --> 41:39.185
- Um, hey, Teddy.
- Yeah?

41:39.252 --> 41:40.652
- Can I talk to you for a quick second?
- Sure.

41:40.720 --> 41:41.753
- I'll be over here.
- All right.

41:45.491 --> 41:48.259
- What's going on?
- I just wanted to let you know...

41:48.328 --> 41:50.061
'cause of the girls and... and all that...

41:50.129 --> 41:52.731
that, um, I'm... I'm buying
myself outta Edgehill.

41:52.799 --> 41:55.801
- Really?
- Yeah, so I'm gonna...

41:55.868 --> 41:58.937
put a mortgage on the
house, sell some stocks.

41:59.004 --> 42:00.671
Wow.

42:00.739 --> 42:03.341
That's, uh... kinda risky.

42:03.408 --> 42:06.077
- Yeah.
- You've always been a risk taker,

42:06.145 --> 42:09.080
so... why not? Go for it, you know?

42:09.148 --> 42:10.915
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

42:10.983 --> 42:12.917
Y'all seem happy.

42:12.985 --> 42:15.486
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

42:15.554 --> 42:18.589
Guess everything works out
the way it's supposed to.

42:18.657 --> 42:21.024
Yeah.

42:21.092 --> 42:22.926
Listen, drive safe.

42:22.994 --> 42:24.528
Good night.

42:29.401 --> 42:30.868
Evening, Mr. Mayor.

42:39.409 --> 42:40.709
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

42:44.848 --> 42:46.715
- Oh, my God.
- Peggy?!
