00:40.554 --> 00:42.317
Aw.
Don't worry about him.

00:42.394 --> 00:44.889
It's good to be passionate
about your hobbies.

00:48.952 --> 00:50.125
Yo, TV!

00:50.202 --> 00:52.246
Get me a chocolate bar!

00:52.422 --> 00:53.548
Okay.

00:55.312 --> 00:56.905
Attaboy!

01:01.988 --> 01:03.163
Ah!

01:03.661 --> 01:05.256
Hello, young man!

01:05.333 --> 01:06.422
Oh!

01:07.696 --> 01:08.783
Psych.

01:11.792 --> 01:14.231
Delicious chocolate bridge...

01:15.233 --> 01:16.280
Ugh!

01:17.028 --> 01:19.156
Yeech! Huh?

01:23.693 --> 01:25.837
"This diary belongs to B.P.

01:25.914 --> 01:27.386
Private property.

01:27.516 --> 01:30.189
If you're still reading this,
you're a bad person."

01:30.257 --> 01:31.274
Uh...

01:31.351 --> 01:32.941
statue of limitations.

01:33.674 --> 01:34.719
Dear diary.

01:34.798 --> 01:35.834
Wow.

01:35.902 --> 01:37.446
I sound like a real cornball.

01:37.549 --> 01:38.563
Oh, well.

01:38.631 --> 01:39.840
Dear diary!

01:39.917 --> 01:42.040
Morn is going to love you.

01:42.117 --> 01:43.396
She's always
ragging about me

01:43.473 --> 01:46.044
spending too much time
with my nose in books.

01:46.121 --> 01:48.019
I wonder what I'm
going to write in you.

01:48.096 --> 01:49.488
What kind of
person will I be

01:49.565 --> 01:51.151
when I get to
your last page?

01:51.228 --> 01:52.789
Will I have
my braces off?

01:52.866 --> 01:55.559
Will I have written a song
that doesn't totally suck?

01:55.636 --> 01:57.015
Will I have
met a cool guy?

01:57.092 --> 01:58.344
I can barely
look at dudes

01:58.421 --> 01:59.421
without
breaking out into

01:59.498 --> 02:00.541
- hives.
- Just another day

02:00.618 --> 02:01.915
in teenage purgatory.

02:01.992 --> 02:03.912
A.K.A.
The School Caf.

02:03.989 --> 02:05.127
Sloppy Joes again.

02:05.204 --> 02:07.011
Boys I did not talk to today...

02:07.088 --> 02:08.940
- Are they trying to kill us?
- Brownieguy...

02:09.017 --> 02:11.286
- Stayed in and tried to cut my bangs.
- Ruffles,  Bryan,

02:11.363 --> 02:12.945
- Morn says it looks like  I got in
- Pennycandy guy...

02:13.013 --> 02:14.461
a fight with a snapping turtle.

02:14.538 --> 02:17.201
Taffi and Mochi are the
coolest girls at school.

02:17.278 --> 02:20.266
When I think about them,
my skin feels sparkly.

02:20.343 --> 02:22.146
They don't
even know I exist.

02:22.223 --> 02:23.218
Why would they?

02:23.295 --> 02:24.312
I'm a nobody.

02:24.389 --> 02:25.608
Less than nobody.

02:25.685 --> 02:27.130
I'm a pimple on the butt of a...

02:27.207 --> 02:28.204
Geez, B.P.

02:28.284 --> 02:29.808
Prone to dramatics much?

02:29.885 --> 02:33.090
The Fire Kingdom
has officially frozen over.

02:33.167 --> 02:37.173
Justin Rockcandy asked
me to the semi-formal!

02:37.250 --> 02:38.409
Oh, my glob.

02:38.486 --> 02:40.949
Just-Justin is taking me
to the Fructose Fair.

02:41.026 --> 02:43.393
Justin... Justin wants to go
on the roller coaster.

02:43.470 --> 02:44.906
Kissing is fun and easy.

02:44.983 --> 02:48.796
If I don't think about the
bacteria in spit teeming, multiplying.

02:48.873 --> 02:50.576
Diary,
can you keep a secret?

02:50.653 --> 02:51.854
Justin! Justin!

02:51.931 --> 02:53.357
Hive of bees in my head,

02:53.434 --> 02:54.936
- get out!
- Mother, I'm not going

02:55.013 --> 02:56.635
- to tell you again!
- Lies, lies, lies!

02:56.703 --> 02:58.689
Diary, it's my birthday
tomorrow,

02:58.766 --> 03:00.325
but I don't feel
like celebrating.

03:00.402 --> 03:02.123
I feel like screaming.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.569
Justin wants to meet
at Lovetree Point.

03:04.646 --> 03:06.724
Says he wants to
give me a present.

03:06.801 --> 03:07.904
I should tell him...

03:07.981 --> 03:09.241
I need to tell him...

03:09.318 --> 03:10.995
I <i>will</i> tell him!

03:11.976 --> 03:13.078
Tell him what?!

03:13.155 --> 03:14.935
Aaaaaah!

03:18.566 --> 03:19.751
Not hungs.

03:19.828 --> 03:21.354
Heading out for a bit.

03:22.929 --> 03:24.036
There you go!

03:24.104 --> 03:26.358
Just needed a lil' push
from the old man.

03:27.618 --> 03:29.755
I gotta get into
the mind of this kid.

03:30.334 --> 03:31.588
Role-play.

03:31.866 --> 03:33.630
Rip! Rip!

03:35.124 --> 03:36.149
Sploosh!

03:36.276 --> 03:39.255
My secret is safe at the
bottom of this disgusting moat.

03:39.332 --> 03:40.338
Oh, oh, B.P.!

03:40.415 --> 03:41.554
What have you done?!

03:41.631 --> 03:42.704
I'm sick of the lies!

03:42.781 --> 03:44.277
Sick, sick, sick!

03:44.354 --> 03:45.355
Babe! Um...

03:45.432 --> 03:46.940
I said I'm sorry?

03:47.017 --> 03:48.280
You don't know me!

03:48.357 --> 03:50.982
Nobody knows me!
Leave me alone!

03:54.564 --> 03:56.741
I hate Sloppy Joes!

04:01.859 --> 04:03.383
Aaaaaah!

04:09.040 --> 04:10.215
Yuck.

04:11.646 --> 04:12.898
What?

04:13.052 --> 04:14.224
Taffi?

04:14.928 --> 04:16.430
Mochi!

04:17.041 --> 04:18.504
Hey, Moch'.

04:18.581 --> 04:21.418
Is that the new
"Nosy Nellies" bootleg 7-inch?

04:21.515 --> 04:23.070
- I ordered it from this
- <i>Taffi, Mochi,</i>

04:23.147 --> 04:24.834
- dude in Lumpy Space.
- <i>down here!</i>

04:24.978 --> 04:26.370
Is it insane?

04:26.494 --> 04:30.779
- It's almost <i>too</i> insane.
- Wicked.

04:33.391 --> 04:35.562
Hiya. B.P.!
What's up?

04:35.639 --> 04:36.722
Justin?

04:36.799 --> 04:38.152
Guilty as charged.

04:38.229 --> 04:40.082
You psyched for your birthday,
birthday girl?

04:40.159 --> 04:41.321
Don't forget
about our little

04:41.398 --> 04:43.587
"Rendez-vous"
at Lovetree Point, huh?

04:43.664 --> 04:45.779
I can't wait for
you to see your prezzie.

04:45.856 --> 04:47.191
You're gonna
be there, right?

04:47.268 --> 04:49.012
Please say yes.
Please! Please!

04:49.089 --> 04:51.469
- Please! Please! Please!
- Aaaaaah!

04:52.910 --> 04:56.029
Barn! Barn! Barn!

04:56.106 --> 04:58.243
Lady, you're
really off your game!

04:58.320 --> 05:00.309
I never win at canasta!

05:04.346 --> 05:07.214
You said you wanted the kid
to spend more time outside.

05:07.291 --> 05:08.691
Barn...
He's outside.

05:08.768 --> 05:09.955
He's loving it!

05:12.847 --> 05:14.910
If it'll make you
feel better, then yes.

05:14.987 --> 05:16.428
But I'm sure he's fine.

05:16.893 --> 05:18.024
Uh-oh.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.110
Uh, son?

05:22.235 --> 05:24.501
- Morn?
- Uh, close enough.

05:24.578 --> 05:26.168
Get out of my room!

05:26.245 --> 05:27.726
TV, what is that?

05:27.803 --> 05:28.929
Private property.

05:29.006 --> 05:30.029
Gimme the book.

05:30.106 --> 05:31.495
Nooooo!

05:31.714 --> 05:34.259
A diary, huh?
Juicy.

05:34.336 --> 05:36.647
And now you've become
dangerously obsessed with it

05:36.724 --> 05:39.713
and have confused your reality
with that of the diary keeper.

05:39.790 --> 05:42.732
You always were a little too
susceptible to fantasy.

05:43.694 --> 05:46.278
Ooh' ripped Pages!
Mystery!

05:46.355 --> 05:48.714
And look how the handwriting
changes right before the rip.

05:48.791 --> 05:50.321
The e's are all crabbed.

05:50.398 --> 05:51.639
That's weird, right?

05:51.716 --> 05:53.365
Super weird, son.

05:53.442 --> 05:55.739
She was obviously
emotionally distraught.

05:55.816 --> 05:58.990
Maybe she was so stressed,
she broke out in hives,

05:59.067 --> 06:01.014
and they covered
her whole body.

06:01.091 --> 06:03.007
So they rushed
her to the hospital.

06:03.084 --> 06:05.875
She was thinking
"Oh, man, I'm so young,"

06:05.952 --> 06:10.261
and how life is so unfair,
and that this was the end.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.286
But it wasn't the end.

06:13.363 --> 06:15.106
She had pulled through...

06:15.183 --> 06:19.819
except her hand had been
replaced with a crab hand!

06:19.896 --> 06:21.803
Which negatively
affected her handwriting.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.420
Yeah!
And, and,

06:23.497 --> 06:25.648
while I recovered,
I refused all visitors.

06:25.725 --> 06:28.866
- Wait. You refused?
- Especially Justin.

06:29.208 --> 06:31.594
How could he love a girl
with a crab hand?

06:31.671 --> 06:32.806
I mean...

06:32.918 --> 06:34.818
that is definitely not normal.

06:34.897 --> 06:37.320
Justin sent me flowers
every day for a week.

06:37.503 --> 06:39.259
Then every other day.

06:39.593 --> 06:41.595
Then they stopped
coming all together.

06:42.462 --> 06:43.480
On my birthday,

06:43.557 --> 06:45.916
I decided I was going to
keep my promise to meet Justin,

06:45.993 --> 06:47.652
crab hand or no crab hand.

06:47.729 --> 06:49.216
But when I got
to Lovetree Point,

06:49.293 --> 06:50.969
Justin was already there...

06:51.529 --> 06:54.147
making outwith my BFFs
Taffi and Mochi!

06:54.224 --> 06:55.428
He did not!

06:55.505 --> 06:57.469
Well,
that's one theory, anyway.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.092
Am I unlovable?

06:59.212 --> 07:01.197
Hey, did you say
Lovetree Point?

07:01.274 --> 07:04.110
That's where the kids used to
go smoochin' back in the day.

07:04.187 --> 07:06.335
This diary must
be pretty old.

07:07.044 --> 07:08.836
We should go
check it out.

07:10.381 --> 07:12.610
Ugh.
This place is a dump.

07:12.717 --> 07:14.629
Why do they call
this Lovetree Point?

07:14.706 --> 07:16.631
'Cause of that
tree over there.

07:17.350 --> 07:19.410
Yeah, it's
pretty heavy-handed.

07:19.561 --> 07:22.005
On page 42, it says
Justin hid a present

07:22.082 --> 07:23.226
somewhere around here.

07:23.303 --> 07:24.615
Maybe it's in the tree.

07:24.692 --> 07:26.237
Hey, good thinking.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.358
Bingo!

07:38.459 --> 07:39.923
It's so beautiful.

07:40.000 --> 07:40.993
Yeah.

07:41.070 --> 07:42.748
B.P. would have loved this.

07:42.825 --> 07:45.566
Justin must have been too
devastated to reclaim it.

07:45.643 --> 07:48.283
Maybe he thinks she'll
come back for it one day.

07:49.239 --> 07:50.850
We've got to
find her, Dad!

07:50.927 --> 07:53.137
She never knew how much
she meant to him.

07:53.214 --> 07:54.639
To all of us!

07:59.702 --> 08:02.807
Y'know, son, I bet I know
where this music box is from.

08:02.884 --> 08:05.000
Maybe they can
give us a clue.

08:06.395 --> 08:09.250
Oh, yes, yes,
this is one of mine,

08:09.327 --> 08:11.803
from my
"Dancing Cat" period.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.405
Do you remember
who bought it?

08:13.482 --> 08:16.454
Oh, goodness,
it feels like a lifetime ago.

08:16.531 --> 08:19.452
I must have made hundreds
of boxes since then,

08:19.529 --> 08:24.224
each marrying sound and
motion to tell a unique story,

08:24.301 --> 08:27.508
the Dance of the
Cosmos in miniature.

08:27.585 --> 08:28.684
Okay.

08:28.803 --> 08:29.895
Well, we gotta go.

08:29.972 --> 08:31.257
A young man bought this!

08:31.334 --> 08:32.365
Justin!

08:32.442 --> 08:33.519
Was he handsome?

08:33.596 --> 08:34.826
Oh, very.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.477
Who was it meant for?

08:36.554 --> 08:38.379
A girl. Betsy.

08:38.456 --> 08:39.799
Ah! B.P.!

08:39.909 --> 08:41.224
She ran away.

08:41.301 --> 08:43.857
Went wild, cut herself
off from the world,

08:43.934 --> 08:46.607
hid away in a cave,
never to be seen again.

08:46.684 --> 08:47.683
Whoa!

08:47.760 --> 08:49.920
But, Dad, there are probably
hundreds of caves in...

08:49.997 --> 08:52.955
It's the one at the fork in
the road to Butterscotch Lake!

08:54.187 --> 08:57.293
The box said she does weird
stuff to bodies up there.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.390
That's it!

09:00.950 --> 09:02.964
Why do you think
Betsy ran away, Dad?

09:03.041 --> 09:04.279
Hard to say.

09:04.356 --> 09:06.414
Some people can't
face their troubles.

09:06.491 --> 09:09.718
But, TV, hiding
away won't solve anything.

09:09.795 --> 09:10.859
Look!

09:11.008 --> 09:13.026
That teachable moment.

09:16.236 --> 09:17.362
Betsy?

09:19.005 --> 09:20.182
Betsy?

09:20.511 --> 09:22.009
Aaaaah!

09:22.471 --> 09:23.688
Betsy.

09:23.868 --> 09:25.476
Oh, my glob.

09:25.553 --> 09:26.930
We're too late!

09:27.007 --> 09:29.700
She was too good
for this cruel world.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.568
- It's a model.
- Huh?

09:31.645 --> 09:32.743
It's plastic.

09:32.820 --> 09:34.149
"Heeyyy."

09:37.822 --> 09:39.059
Hey, look at this!

09:39.136 --> 09:40.410
A letter.

09:40.601 --> 09:42.200
Maybe we
shouldn't read this.

09:42.277 --> 09:43.898
Yes, we should.

09:44.017 --> 09:47.826
Dear Justin,
I'm not sure you'll ever read this letter.

09:47.903 --> 09:50.534
Maybe I'm writing this
more for myself anyway.

09:50.774 --> 09:51.843
You know when
you're little

09:51.920 --> 09:54.324
and the future feels
really far away?

09:54.401 --> 09:56.089
You don't know
what it looks like.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.768
You just hope you'll have
stuff figured out by then.

09:58.845 --> 10:01.586
You'll know exactly
how to act and feel.

10:01.663 --> 10:03.835
You'll have conquered
all your fears.

10:03.912 --> 10:06.473
And you'll never feel dumb
or uncomfortable.

10:06.550 --> 10:08.940
You don't think about how
you'll actually get there.

10:09.017 --> 10:11.499
The middle parts,
between now and then...

10:11.576 --> 10:13.511
the middle parts suck!

10:13.588 --> 10:15.997
Which is why I split,
I guess...

10:16.178 --> 10:18.844
Okay, so riding out your
teen years in a cave is

10:18.921 --> 10:20.130
pretty dramatic.
But...

10:20.207 --> 10:22.478
do you know how much
reading you get done in a cave?

10:22.555 --> 10:25.021
I even figured out
a cure for my crab hand!

10:25.098 --> 10:27.493
Oh, Justin,
I hope you're not too upset,

10:27.570 --> 10:29.304
and I hope you didn't
spend too much money

10:29.381 --> 10:31.007
on that birthday present.

10:31.084 --> 10:33.419
It wouldn't have worked
out between us anyway.

10:33.496 --> 10:34.912
You're kind of clingy.

10:34.989 --> 10:37.566
Sincerely,
Nurse Betsy Poundcake.

10:37.643 --> 10:38.919
Nurse Poundcake!

10:38.996 --> 10:40.928
I've got the injection,
Doctor.

10:41.005 --> 10:42.912
I'm not gonna
make it, man! Gah!

10:42.989 --> 10:44.448
You <i>will</i> live.

10:44.525 --> 10:47.099
Way to take control of the
situation, nurse.

10:47.176 --> 10:49.231
Save it for the Post-Op, Doc.

10:49.308 --> 10:51.678
Wow.
B.P. is Nurse Poundcake.

10:51.755 --> 10:53.275
She turned out fine.

10:53.352 --> 10:55.148
But what about
the ripped pages?

10:55.225 --> 10:56.962
Oh, I saw them
in the cabin.

10:57.039 --> 10:59.414
It was just a lot of
mean stuff about Justin.

10:59.491 --> 11:02.200
Hey, that guy must
be pretty sad, huh?

11:02.277 --> 11:03.785
Hey, you wanna
go find <i>him?</i>

11:03.902 --> 11:04.912
No.
