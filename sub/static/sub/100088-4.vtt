this really nice reservation

00:11.924 --> 00:13.535
at this restaurant
up in Richmond.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.232
That's a hundred
miles away.

00:15.276 --> 00:17.147
SONNY:
Well, don't want anybody
to spot us.

00:17.191 --> 00:19.062
[phone chiming]

00:19.106 --> 00:21.325
Oh, we got a new target
package coming in.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.066
I got to go back.
I'm sorry.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.155
Hey, don't be sorry.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.417
I'm gonna try
for warrant officer.

00:26.461 --> 00:27.636
NAIMA:
What about Jason?

00:27.679 --> 00:29.377
You'll be an officer?

00:29.420 --> 00:30.595
Won't you outrank him?

00:30.639 --> 00:32.249
How's he gonna take that?

00:32.293 --> 00:33.816
Jason'll be fine.

00:33.859 --> 00:34.904
Gentlemen, it's my privilege

00:34.947 --> 00:36.166
to introduce you

00:36.210 --> 00:38.908
to DEVGRU's
next commanding officer,

00:38.951 --> 00:40.170
Captain Greyson Lindell.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.606
Bravo Team,
Captain Harrington

00:41.650 --> 00:43.260
told me all about you.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.176
JASON:
Game, set...

00:46.220 --> 00:48.265
Ripper Magoo,
next round's on you, buddy boy.

00:48.309 --> 00:49.658
It's getting expensive

00:49.701 --> 00:51.094
hanging with you
like this, man.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.443
Is that four in a row?JASON: That would be

00:52.487 --> 00:54.663
five in a row.
Hey, beer's a great motivator.

00:54.706 --> 00:55.925
How about you, Sonny boy?

00:55.968 --> 00:57.318
Want to get the
next beating?

00:57.361 --> 00:59.581
What?I got to tell you, man,
it's a little sad

00:59.624 --> 01:02.627
watching you sit there moping
and waiting for a call

01:02.671 --> 01:04.194
that's never
gonna come in.Oh, come on, now.

01:04.238 --> 01:07.545
Look-it, man, couples text

01:07.589 --> 01:09.330

01:09.373 --> 01:11.332
Come on, this whole girlfriend
thing, is it a rumor, or what?

01:11.375 --> 01:12.898
Look, I did not
get stood up.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.726
Because she has
work obligations, as do I.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.946
Speaking of which,
I actually have

01:16.989 --> 01:19.340
a bottle at home
with my name on it.

01:19.383 --> 01:20.906
See ya.Hard to believe

01:20.950 --> 01:22.995
I drafted that dude.
Be careful, or he's gonna be

01:23.039 --> 01:24.519
walking around upright
real soon.

01:24.562 --> 01:26.129
Damn.

01:26.173 --> 01:28.131
Whole team's evolving, man.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.915
And Bravo's gonna
look a lot different

01:29.959 --> 01:32.179
once Ray leaves to
run his own team.

01:32.222 --> 01:34.616
Whoa, whoa.
Pump the brakes there.

01:34.659 --> 01:36.748
You lobbying for 2IC?

01:36.792 --> 01:40.404
Come on. Be a long time
before you wear that crown.I'm just saying,

01:40.448 --> 01:43.407
who you gonna turn to in a bind
once Ray's gone, Full Metal?

01:43.451 --> 01:45.540
Sure, if I want
to bury a body.Yeah, exactly.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.063
I'm saying that...

01:47.107 --> 01:48.717
Ray leaves a void.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.154
And you think you're the one
who can fill that void?

01:51.198 --> 01:52.329
Yeah.

01:52.373 --> 01:54.331
Yeah? Okay, tell you what...

01:54.375 --> 01:56.464
[dart thuds]let's go hit Smoke's.

Your teammate suffers

02:34.371 --> 02:36.330
a line-over chute malfunction
that strands him

02:36.373 --> 02:38.941
in enemy territory on
the other side of the mountain

from your LZ.

Excuse me, Lopez,

03:09.406 --> 03:11.582
but how warm and fuzzy
you are for this guy

03:11.626 --> 03:12.757

I first joined Bravo, Jason.

Well, thatRay needed
to hear that.

up with you later.

my last candidate.

04:47.243 --> 04:48.723
[barks]Hey!

04:48.766 --> 04:52.727
This is Dr. Natalie Pierce.
She is a research physiologist

04:52.770 --> 04:55.338
at the NHRC's Department
of Warfighter Performance.

04:55.382 --> 04:58.994
The Navy can keep trying,
but my head can't be shrunk.

04:59.037 --> 05:01.344
She's a physiologist,
not a psychologist, Sonny.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.998
Please, just
call me Natalie.

05:03.041 --> 05:06.610
I'm here to conduct research
to identify risk factors

05:06.654 --> 05:08.786
associated with
operational longevity.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.701
Bravo Team's
your lab rats, right?

05:10.745 --> 05:12.877
I know how this kind of thing
could be received downrange.

05:12.921 --> 05:15.010
I just wanted to get us all
on the same page.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.228
Same page, that's all.

05:16.272 --> 05:18.100
LINDELL:
Master Chief Hayes, a word.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.625
Warfighter longevity is
one of my priorities.

05:21.669 --> 05:24.367
Most valuable resource
for future generations

05:24.411 --> 05:26.630
is the current one.
I would like you to give Natalie

05:26.674 --> 05:28.937
every opportunity
to work with Bravo Team.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.286
Appreciate that, sir,

05:30.330 --> 05:32.332
but Bravo Team has a
way of doing things.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.724
We're just fine.
NATALIE:
Do you?

05:33.768 --> 05:35.335
Bravo Team has

05:35.378 --> 05:38.555
a lot of miles on it,
and you have even more.

05:38.599 --> 05:41.645
Lot a gas left in the tank.
I actually have that
"new car" smell.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.430
NATALIE [chuckles]:
I'm here to...

05:43.473 --> 05:45.345
help you manage
that wear-and-tear.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.390
Keep the tank from hitting
empty, and the only way

05:47.434 --> 05:49.653
that I can do that is by
seeing what's under the hood.

05:49.697 --> 05:52.482
Wow. Now, you know what,
that is quite a sales pitch.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.963
It's not a pitch.
It's my job.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.268
And I'm good at it.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.531
I'm sure you're
better than good.

05:57.574 --> 06:00.708
But... we're fine.

06:00.751 --> 06:03.145
It is my belief that
nobody could benefit more

06:03.188 --> 06:06.148
from Natalie's expertise
than you, Master Chief.

06:06.191 --> 06:08.846
I just wanted you
to break the ice.

06:08.890 --> 06:11.196
Ice has been broken, sir.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.416
Dr. Pierce.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.591
Natalie.

06:20.641 --> 06:22.556
Warrant Officer Mack,
you got a minute?

06:22.599 --> 06:26.603
Hmm. That's awful formal
sounding for a door-kicker,

06:26.647 --> 06:28.866
Senior Chief Perry.
What's up, man?[laughs]

06:28.910 --> 06:31.303
You all right?I wanted to, uh--
Yeah, I'm good.

06:31.347 --> 06:33.567
I just wanted to follow up
about putting in a package.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.003
Don't tell me
you changed your mind

06:35.046 --> 06:37.484
about going warrant officer?Oh, not a chance.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.311
My man.

06:39.355 --> 06:42.576
My man. Have a seat.Yeah. Yeah.

06:42.619 --> 06:46.057
I was afraid your teammates
talked you out of it.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.451
Frogmen freak
when one of us goes warrant.Well, that's because

06:48.495 --> 06:50.671
no one actually knows what
the hell a warrant officer does.

06:50.714 --> 06:52.890
That's kind of true.

06:52.934 --> 06:55.458
Got the fancy title.
Straddling the worlds

06:55.502 --> 06:58.026
between enlisted
and officer ranks.

06:58.069 --> 06:59.680
You wonder why our boys freak?Nah, that's the beauty

06:59.723 --> 07:01.203
of the gig, man--
it's, like, one day

07:01.246 --> 07:03.292
you're in your camis
on a sniper rifle, the next day

07:03.335 --> 07:05.903
you're in a suit
rubbing elbows with dignitaries,

07:05.947 --> 07:08.558
trying to facilitate
a clandestine op.

07:08.602 --> 07:12.083
You end up becoming, like, a...
an expert in all things

07:12.127 --> 07:14.216
Special Operations,
you know what I mean?

07:14.259 --> 07:16.566
Offer Bravo a fresh perspective.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.699
Well, it's a good thing
Jason Hayes is always open

07:18.742 --> 07:20.352
to new ideas, you know?Right.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.964
Right. How'd he take the news?

07:23.007 --> 07:25.575
My team leader's head
exploded when I told him.

07:25.619 --> 07:26.924
Yeah.

07:26.968 --> 07:29.144
I haven't exactly told him yet.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.017
So, look, I'm just gonna say it.

07:33.061 --> 07:34.541
I, uh, I'd appreciate it

07:34.584 --> 07:36.325
if you'd consider sponsoring
my package.

07:36.368 --> 07:38.762
Really?

07:38.806 --> 07:41.243
Look, a thinking man like you,

07:41.286 --> 07:43.463
you're gonna make a
great warrant, okay?

07:43.506 --> 07:44.942
Put your service
record together.

07:44.986 --> 07:46.509
I'll convene a review board.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.250
Make sure you, you know,
walk the line

07:48.293 --> 07:49.773
for the next few months, okay?

07:49.817 --> 07:51.819
I don't want anything
derailing your application.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.211
I hear you.

07:55.692 --> 07:58.390
Never thought I'd be
jealous of paperwork.

07:58.434 --> 08:00.958
But them hours you've
been grinding with eggheads,

08:01.002 --> 08:02.612
you're startin' to change.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.396
I'm sorry about
last night.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.486
Just awful inconsiderate.

08:06.529 --> 08:10.098
The enemy isn't considerate
of our social schedule.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.056
Well, I'll make
it up to you.
Oh, yeah?

08:12.100 --> 08:14.537
Yeah, I got us tickets
to the Longbranch Rodeo.Ooh-wee.

08:14.581 --> 08:17.061

a net of razor wire

just handed us our lunch.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.016
That's when we care, Sonny.

18:25.060 --> 18:28.019
Okay, well, this game is rigged
'cause those newbies know

18:28.063 --> 18:29.804
when and where
we're coming.Get your head

18:29.847 --> 18:31.849
in the game, Sonny. Think.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.112
You're
more concerned

18:33.155 --> 18:35.636
about some broad
standing you up on the phone,

18:35.679 --> 18:37.638
doesn't call you back.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.030
What the hell
did you just say?

18:39.074 --> 18:41.076
J.What part of that
did you not understand?

18:41.120 --> 18:43.731
You're more concerned
about your phone not ringing!J!

18:43.774 --> 18:45.124
Look, man,
maybe we call it a night.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.038
A-And we come back tomorrow
after we cool off, okay?

18:47.082 --> 18:48.692
No, we're not gonna
call it a night.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.868
We're gonna run it again. And
then we're gonna go run it again

18:50.912 --> 18:52.131
until we get it right.

18:52.174 --> 18:53.871
Nobody leaves
the base.

18:53.915 --> 18:55.743
Lockdown. Getting it right.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.092
Run it again!

19:06.232 --> 19:08.799
[groans]

19:08.843 --> 19:10.845
[grunts]

19:16.285 --> 19:18.200
Painkillers, huh?

19:18.244 --> 19:19.288
[groans]

19:19.332 --> 19:20.855
Ooh.

19:20.898 --> 19:22.726
Must've been a hell of a day.[sighs]

19:22.770 --> 19:24.859
Still early.
The day is not over.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.861
Trust me, I can still get it up.

19:26.904 --> 19:29.733
You certainly know your way
around a cold pack.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.344
I'm guessing that's from

19:31.387 --> 19:33.259
the four arthroscopic
knee surgeries,

19:33.302 --> 19:34.434
the torn rotator cuff,

19:34.477 --> 19:36.436
the dozen
bone fractures.

19:36.479 --> 19:39.874
Right. Did you read
all about that in my jacket?

19:39.917 --> 19:41.223
Let me guess, they had a, uh,

19:41.267 --> 19:42.833
centerfold of me

19:42.877 --> 19:44.618
that you could pull out,
look at, too, huh?[chuckles]

19:44.661 --> 19:47.055
Sadly, no.
But it did paint a picture.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.100
Well, keep that
picture in your brain,

19:49.144 --> 19:51.102
'cause, uh, that's the only way
you're gonna see me.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.669
Sure about that?

19:52.713 --> 19:55.106
You're in the top one percent
when it comes to operator age.

19:55.150 --> 19:56.543
I'm the top one percent
when it comes

19:56.586 --> 19:57.892
to anything operator-related.

19:57.935 --> 20:00.286
Called rarefied air.[chuckles]

20:00.329 --> 20:02.636
Even air gets old.

20:02.679 --> 20:04.159
That's where
I come in.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.075
You know, I'll tell you what,
I'll pass.

20:07.118 --> 20:09.077
I understand the body.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.296
I understand how I work.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.298
I don't need anyone
to tell me differently.

20:12.341 --> 20:15.649
Course.Okay? No one
is gonna tell me the odds.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.259
Worked with a ton of team guys.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.261
You all look at me the same
at first.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.263
Really? And
how is that?

20:21.307 --> 20:23.526
Oh, like I'm a narc,[chuckles]

20:23.570 --> 20:25.746
sent in to find out
just how damaged you are

20:25.789 --> 20:28.531
so that Command can ship you off
to the scrap heap.

20:30.707 --> 20:33.275
You know, you have a very
Serpico vibe to you.

20:33.319 --> 20:35.016
Mm. Yeah.

20:35.059 --> 20:37.323
You don't know me
and you do not trust me.

20:37.366 --> 20:41.283
But another perspective
is often the missing ingredient

20:41.327 --> 20:43.154
in maximizing longevity.

20:43.198 --> 20:44.591
Right. Well,

20:44.634 --> 20:46.201
tell you what.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.899
It's a shame
that there's nothing missing,

20:48.943 --> 20:51.772
'cause I really wanted
to see you again.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.295
I'm fine.

20:53.339 --> 20:56.820
Yeah. That's why you're wearing,
uh, two beer cans there

20:56.864 --> 20:59.388
and popping tramadol
like they're M&M'S?

20:59.432 --> 21:02.435
[sighs]Look, there's one thing
I know about operators:

21:02.478 --> 21:04.959
as much as you say
you're all about team,

21:05.002 --> 21:08.049
you think you can take on
the world all by yourselves.

21:08.092 --> 21:10.660
I'll be here
when you realize you can't.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.837
[sighs]

21:14.882 --> 21:16.405
Davis.

21:16.449 --> 21:17.928
Hey.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.713
Listen, just wanted
to clear the air.

21:19.756 --> 21:21.410
Not at work, Sonny.

21:21.454 --> 21:24.457
Okay, well, where else
are we gonna do it?

21:30.114 --> 21:31.638
[sighs]

21:31.681 --> 21:33.596
Does Ray know about us?

21:33.640 --> 21:35.468
No.Then why did

21:35.511 --> 21:37.731
you need to explain to him
that we're just friends?

21:37.774 --> 21:40.473
He saw us in Serbia,
and he asked.

21:40.516 --> 21:43.476
And you didn't tell me?

21:43.519 --> 21:46.653
Is this why you wanted to
go to Richmond last month?

21:46.696 --> 21:48.481
You know, I almost missed
a briefing because of that.

21:48.524 --> 21:49.482
What-what do you mean?

21:49.525 --> 21:51.527
Lisa, people go to Richmond.

21:51.571 --> 21:52.920
They-they go to dinner,

21:52.963 --> 21:54.400
and people
miss things, okay?Sonny,

21:54.443 --> 21:56.271
we are walking in a minefield,

21:56.315 --> 21:58.621
and the least that you can do
is tell me where the mines are.

21:58.665 --> 22:00.319
This relationship
is hard enough,

22:00.362 --> 22:03.060
but it's gonna be impossible
if I can't trust you.

22:03.104 --> 22:05.411
You're telling me
you can't trust me?

22:05.454 --> 22:07.369
You're in your head, Lisa,
and you need to relax.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.892
Don't tell me what to do.

22:08.936 --> 22:11.373
[chuckles]
What is your problem?You're not listening.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.419
That is my problem.Wow.

22:13.462 --> 22:15.377
I can't do this right now.Yeah.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.727
We've got 14 people that
are depending on us.We do.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.773
Okay.Roger that.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.646
♪

22:35.615 --> 22:38.357
Fall back! Fall back!
We're pinned down!

22:40.663 --> 22:41.882
Damn it!

22:43.797 --> 22:45.407
[gunfire continues]Too slow!

22:45.451 --> 22:47.017
Move!

22:48.454 --> 22:49.585
[gunshots]

22:52.893 --> 22:55.199
[alarm buzzing]

Back to one. Do it
again. Run it again!

23:16.090 --> 23:17.483
12 hours straight.
I feel like a rented mule.

23:17.526 --> 23:18.658
Still not good enough.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.399
We're still outgunned
once we make entry.

23:20.442 --> 23:23.010
Still taking too long
to open the first hatch.

23:23.053 --> 23:25.012
SONNY:
I've been staring
at a 10,000-degree lightsaber

23:25.055 --> 23:26.535
on repeat. I'm going blind.

23:26.579 --> 23:27.971
What about a carbide blade?

23:28.015 --> 23:29.712
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.Carbide blade cuts faster

23:29.756 --> 23:31.192
than a diamond cuts.
Can shave off 15, 20...What'd you just say?

23:31.235 --> 23:32.976
What'd you say?
Maybe I'll use it

23:33.020 --> 23:34.543
to cut that loose tongue
out of your mouth, newbie.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.589
You better watch yourself,
Yoder.Come on.

23:36.632 --> 23:38.678
Come on.
Ease up, Texas.

23:38.721 --> 23:40.419
Carbide blade

23:40.462 --> 23:41.724
wears out faster, anyway.

23:41.768 --> 23:43.291
Two hatches down,
Sonny'll be changing blades

23:43.334 --> 23:45.206
while the bad guy
starts popping hostages.

23:45.249 --> 23:48.209
Well, Yoder's just trying
to execute Jason's plan, okay?

23:48.252 --> 23:50.254
Maybe we wouldn't
be in this jam

23:50.298 --> 23:51.430
if y'all were doing
the same thing.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.909
You know what,
tell me what the team needs

23:52.953 --> 23:54.520
once you've been here as long
as I have, how about that?

23:54.563 --> 23:56.435
Well, I hear that's not
possible, Ray, 'cause I hear

23:56.478 --> 23:57.784
you're never leaving.JASON:
All right, knock it off.

23:57.827 --> 23:59.002
Knock it off.

23:59.046 --> 24:00.003
Running us into the ground

24:00.047 --> 24:01.309
isn't proving anything, Jason.

24:01.352 --> 24:03.224
It proves to me that
priorities are out of whack.

24:03.267 --> 24:05.182
That's what it proves to me.SONNY:
Our priorities?

24:05.226 --> 24:06.532
Yeah, priorities, Sonny.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.185
SONNY:
What the hell, man?
We were locked in here

24:08.229 --> 24:11.319
playing paintball because
you got nowhere else to go

24:11.362 --> 24:12.451
but the bar.Hour break.

24:12.494 --> 24:13.843
SONNY: Yeah.Eat some Twinkies.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.279
That's the truth
and you know it.All right...

24:15.323 --> 24:17.456
Back at it.Yeah, grab another drink.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.678
[exhales]

24:27.378 --> 24:28.989
Stop.

24:30.077 --> 24:31.295
Ready?

24:31.339 --> 24:32.296
Yeah.

24:32.340 --> 24:33.515
[both grunt]

24:33.559 --> 24:35.517
You didn't have to do that.

24:35.561 --> 24:39.086
Yeah, well,
I figure if I'm nice,

24:39.129 --> 24:41.175
maybe you'll stop
shooting us in the ass.

24:41.218 --> 24:43.090
[laughs]
You know,

24:43.133 --> 24:45.092
you guys don't stand a chance.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.267
I mean,

24:46.310 --> 24:47.964
we know when you're coming.

24:48.008 --> 24:50.663
I know your hook point.

24:50.706 --> 24:52.142
We may be Green Team,

24:52.186 --> 24:54.884
but we're still
serious door-kickers.

24:54.928 --> 24:56.495
Read in your file
you're from Newark.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.540
That's a rough city, man.You could say that.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.368
I know that look.
Come on, talk on it.

25:00.411 --> 25:02.065
Neighborhood,
I could handle.

25:02.109 --> 25:04.285
My old man was a
different story, though,

25:04.328 --> 25:05.939
depending which version of him

25:05.982 --> 25:07.244
walked through the
door that night.

25:07.288 --> 25:09.159
But you did eventually get away.

25:09.203 --> 25:10.421
Yeah?Yeah.

25:10.465 --> 25:11.858
When I was 14.

25:11.901 --> 25:14.208
Lebanese restaurant.

25:14.251 --> 25:16.210
Started washing dishes.

25:16.253 --> 25:17.733
That's where you learned Arabic.

25:17.777 --> 25:20.301
[speaking Arabic]

25:24.523 --> 25:27.613
Spent my whole life
feeling out of place.

25:27.656 --> 25:29.353
So I ran.

25:29.397 --> 25:32.879
I ran from my family,
from the restaurant.

25:32.922 --> 25:35.185
I even ran from the
regular Navy to BUD/S.

25:35.229 --> 25:38.624
But when I made it to
the teams, I stopped.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.235
Think you'd fit in well
with our team?

25:41.278 --> 25:43.367
You got a bunch of
stone-cold hammers

25:43.411 --> 25:45.195
who aren't afraid

25:45.239 --> 25:47.241
to let the world
know their opinions.

25:49.112 --> 25:52.507
If being alpha is the prime
ingredient for Bravo,

25:52.551 --> 25:55.118
well, then, Yoder's
your man, not me.

25:55.162 --> 25:56.990
But if you need a guy

25:57.033 --> 25:59.296
who can keep his mouth
shut, his kit tight

25:59.340 --> 26:02.517
and wants to do the work?

26:02.561 --> 26:05.302
Well, then, I might be your guy.

26:09.045 --> 26:11.004
Direct ISR to Ha Long Bay

26:11.047 --> 26:12.788
and track the coast
moving north.

26:12.832 --> 26:15.312
The Orion 9'sprobably hiding
amongst the commercial boats

26:15.356 --> 26:17.358
in the area.Roger that, ma'am.

26:19.273 --> 26:21.231
Find the Orion,Ensign Davis?

26:21.275 --> 26:23.277
Not yet, sir.
Uh, but we did confirm

26:23.320 --> 26:25.409
that it made port
in Cam Pha two days ago.

26:25.453 --> 26:27.673
Vietnam. Makes sense. Remote.

26:27.716 --> 26:29.762
Less likely to run
into issues there.

26:29.805 --> 26:30.980
I'm guessing
they're sailing north

26:31.024 --> 26:32.678
for the protection
of Chinese waters.

26:32.721 --> 26:35.376
That's great work, Ensign.Took too long

26:35.419 --> 26:36.986
to figure out.

26:37.030 --> 26:38.335
Every minute counts.

26:38.379 --> 26:40.120
Ensign.

26:40.163 --> 26:42.165
Officers carry
a heavy enough burden

26:42.209 --> 26:43.602
without kicking the snot
out of themselves.

26:43.645 --> 26:46.039
No offense,
but you got to get over it.

26:46.082 --> 26:47.518
You committed
all your energy and focus

26:47.562 --> 26:49.520
into finding the Orion.
You did your job.

26:49.564 --> 26:51.174
Done.

26:55.396 --> 26:57.964
Bravo must be primed
for battle

26:58.007 --> 26:59.226
with all the training
you guys have been doing.

26:59.269 --> 27:00.662
More like, uh...

27:00.706 --> 27:02.229
coming apart at the seams.

27:02.272 --> 27:04.013
Jason's got us locked down.

27:04.057 --> 27:05.711
Guys are
at each other's throats,

27:05.754 --> 27:08.017
but he can't see
he's just making things worse.

27:08.061 --> 27:10.019
Jason's digging in his heels?
I can't believe it.

27:10.063 --> 27:12.326
[chuckles]Oh, he just seems hell-bent

27:12.369 --> 27:14.981
on proving he can do this op
without me. Without any of us.

27:15.024 --> 27:16.504
And given all the challenges
of this op,

27:16.547 --> 27:18.245
it seems like
your perspective might help.

27:18.288 --> 27:21.509
Unfortunately, "help" is
a foreign word to Jason, Mandy.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.293
I'll talk to you.

27:37.046 --> 27:38.221
All right, let's go.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.614
Break time's over, okay?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.398
Sonny, switch out
the quickie saw with the Broco.

27:41.442 --> 27:42.922
Come on.Roger that.

27:44.271 --> 27:46.447
Ensign Davis just located
the Orion 9

27:46.490 --> 27:48.362
sitting off the coast
of Vietnam.

Oh, man, I would
much rather crack

27:55.412 --> 27:56.849
this nut before jumping
back in the fire.

27:56.892 --> 27:58.459
[grunts]It's a little late

27:58.502 --> 28:00.679
to start caring about training
now, there, Sonny.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.724
Ah, kiss my ass,
platinum wonder.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.073
RAY: You think
the Pentagon cares

28:04.117 --> 28:05.509
that every run
has ended in disaster?

28:05.553 --> 28:07.381
Know what, Pentagon trusts
us to hit it on target.

28:07.424 --> 28:09.078
They say go, we go.

28:16.782 --> 28:19.219

Yeah.Can't sleep?

28:22.744 --> 28:24.441
Yeah, well, you know,
jumping into a zero-margin op

28:24.485 --> 28:25.965
where the team's
been off all week?

28:26.008 --> 28:27.444
Yeah, I can't sleep.
What do you think?

28:27.488 --> 28:29.272
So now you're trying
to figure out the impossible

28:29.316 --> 28:32.101
all by yourself?I've done it
before, Sonny.

28:32.145 --> 28:34.451
I know you have.

28:34.495 --> 28:37.977
But is that what got you
through BUD/S alone?

28:38.020 --> 28:39.979
What about Green Team?

28:40.022 --> 28:41.981
The strength of the pack

28:42.024 --> 28:43.286
is the wolf,

28:43.330 --> 28:46.115
but the strength of the wolf
is the pack.

28:46.159 --> 28:48.465
And the pack's out of sorts
right now.Okay, well,

28:48.509 --> 28:49.815
maybe training
balls to the wall's

28:49.858 --> 28:51.251
got something to do with that.Got to run hard

28:51.294 --> 28:52.992
if you want to break through.

28:53.035 --> 28:55.255
And breakthrough is worthless
if the cost is breakdown.

28:55.298 --> 28:57.344
You're here
to question my leadership,

28:57.387 --> 29:00.173
just turn around, go to sleep.

29:00.216 --> 29:02.523
Jace, I would
follow you anywhere.

29:02.566 --> 29:04.003
You know that.

29:04.046 --> 29:06.179
But you got this way
of bending the universe

29:06.222 --> 29:07.789
and forcing it into the way

29:07.833 --> 29:10.096
you think things
are supposed to be.

You're not alone
in this, Jason.

Uh, that's a scenario
we trained for.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.858
Let's run it like we planned,
boys. Let's go.

29:34.163 --> 29:35.817
All right, hold up.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.169
Look,

29:40.213 --> 29:42.041
I know

29:42.084 --> 29:44.130
these past few days, I've...

29:44.173 --> 29:46.045
pushed you really hard
during the training.

29:46.088 --> 29:49.265
And maybe that's
because of all the changes

29:49.309 --> 29:52.486
that I'm going through
back home in my life.

29:52.529 --> 29:54.053
I just want you

29:54.096 --> 29:57.273
to know that I trust each and
every one of you with my life.

we already got a lot of Yoders.

is a guy

his teammates,

38:40.405 --> 38:41.797

a ninja team leader
