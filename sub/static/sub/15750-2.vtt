00:31.400 --> 00:34.061
Join the union!
Workers' rights for all!

00:34.111 --> 00:37.661
Ladies and gentlemen who will
protect you if war breaks out

00:37.712 --> 00:39.671
and Selfridge goes back to America?

00:39.722 --> 00:41.782
Oi! Watch what you're doing. You all
right?

00:41.833 --> 00:43.853
I beg your pardon, miss. No harm
done, I hope?

00:43.903 --> 00:45.804
I'm fine thank you.

00:45.853 --> 00:47.813
Come on, I'll walk with you.

00:48.163 --> 00:50.795
Morning, Mr. Crabb.
Mr. Thackeray. Mr. Crabb.

00:50.843 --> 00:52.875
Unions causing trouble all over the
country.

00:52.923 --> 00:55.703
You go ahead. I'll deal with this.

00:55.754 --> 00:57.715
Sorry, mate, can't take it.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.896
Can I have a moment of your time?
Won't hurt you to read it.

00:59.947 --> 01:03.136
If you have to fight for your country,
you'll want a union to comeback to.

01:03.166 --> 01:05.186
Come along, ladies.

01:05.236 --> 01:07.858
Gentlemen, can I interest you in one
of these?

01:12.917 --> 01:15.749
If there's war, why does we have to
get involved?

01:15.799 --> 01:17.840
I don't know. I don't understand any
of it.

01:17.889 --> 01:21.758
With all this trouble in Europe, Mr.
Selfridge might decide to go back to
America.

01:21.809 --> 01:23.880
He wouldn't, would he?
What's stopping him?

01:23.930 --> 01:25.901
His family live there most of the
time as it is.

01:25.950 --> 01:27.952
But what about us? Our jobs?

01:30.762 --> 01:32.823
Mr. Selfridge isn't going anywhere.

01:35.801 --> 01:37.605
Listen to me!

01:38.773 --> 01:41.744
We've had quite enough excitement for
one morning.

01:42.954 --> 01:47.716
Now hurry along to your stations,
please, quietly and with decorum.

01:48.905 --> 01:52.826
It was a peaceful demonstration but
the message was clear enough.

01:55.826 --> 01:59.778
The staff know our position on trade
unions: we take care of our own.

01:59.829 --> 02:01.838
We do, but we're in the minority.

02:01.888 --> 02:04.678
Workers are protesting all over
London.

02:04.729 --> 02:06.820
Dissatisfaction spreads.

02:06.869 --> 02:09.739
Well, our people feel secure enough.

02:11.470 --> 02:13.901
Rumors have started, Mr. Selfridge.
What rumors?

02:13.951 --> 02:16.091
There's a notion
that you may return to America.

02:16.142 --> 02:19.763
That's ludicrous.
Where's Mr. Grove?

02:19.812 --> 02:22.722
I'm sure he's on the shop floor
doing his rounds.

02:22.772 --> 02:24.853
We must reassure the staff
immediately.

02:24.903 --> 02:28.883
Miss Plunkett, arrange a heads of
department meeting as soon as
possible.

02:28.934 --> 02:31.684
And get Mr. Grove up here.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.685
Mr. Grove, you're late.

02:33.735 --> 02:38.707
Mr. Crabb, apprise Mr. Grove of the
situation.

02:38.756 --> 02:40.876
I want to see you in my office in
five minutes.

02:46.928 --> 02:50.708
You couldn't wait till I got in?
I was trying to cover for you.

02:50.758 --> 02:52.760
And not for the first time, Mr.
Grove.

02:56.740 --> 02:59.890
These are Mr. Selfridge's requirements
for this week's promotional displays.

02:59.939 --> 03:03.821
Menswear, Haberdashery, Outdoor
Equipment. Top priority.

03:03.870 --> 03:05.924
Er... Thank you, Miss Plunkett.

03:05.972 --> 03:09.792
And you're needed at a head of
departments meeting in 15 minutes.

03:09.843 --> 03:11.842
Never a dull moment.

03:13.824 --> 03:17.823
We need to reassure the staff.
We've always looked out for our own.

03:17.874 --> 03:19.955
We always will.
Yes, Mr. Selfridge.

03:23.935 --> 03:26.955
Good of you to join us, Miss Towler.
Sorry, Mr. Selfridge.

03:28.865 --> 03:30.947
With the stock market already in
turmoil.

03:32.937 --> 03:34.856
Your pencil, Miss Towler.

03:34.906 --> 03:36.918
Now, with the stock market in
turmoil,

03:36.968 --> 03:39.769
if our staff are jittery and the
morale is low

03:39.820 --> 03:42.759
what does that say to our suppliers
and our buyers?

03:42.808 --> 03:45.920
What I need to do is distract people
from what's really going on.

03:45.969 --> 03:48.761
I need ideas? What do you have?

03:48.810 --> 03:50.951
Anyone? Miss Towler?

03:55.862 --> 03:57.821
We could have a dance!

03:57.872 --> 04:02.743
How about a tango demonstration here
in the store?

04:02.793 --> 04:03.984
All the girls love the tango

04:04.744 --> 04:07.714
and Senor Gomerez is performing at
Delphine's.

04:07.765 --> 04:09.815
Oh, he's meant to be amazing!

04:12.826 --> 04:14.896
That's an excellent idea. I love it.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.916
Inspired thinking, Miss Hawkins.

04:17.966 --> 04:21.767
And maybe... a staff party afterwards?

04:21.976 --> 04:24.548
I like it. Very good thinking.

04:24.598 --> 04:27.428
We'll book the Palm Court,
no expense spared, for tomorrow evening.

04:27.477 --> 04:29.488
Get a hold of Delphine's and book
the dancers.

04:29.498 --> 04:33.799
Now, we need something to raise the
spirit of the public as well.

04:33.859 --> 04:36.900
Something... big and British.

04:37.920 --> 04:39.851
An Empire exhibition!

04:39.901 --> 04:41.921
We could put something on in the Palm
Court.

04:41.971 --> 04:44.891
If that's all right with Mr. Colleano,
of course.

04:45.933 --> 04:47.973
Fine, Miss Towler.

04:49.792 --> 04:51.944
Something simple, low-key but
effective.

04:51.994 --> 04:55.945
A display of photographs, merchandise
and maps?

04:57.965 --> 05:01.904
Something a little more colorful
and entertaining. Think about it.

05:01.955 --> 05:03.955
Thank you all for your time.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.776
Excellent idea, Miss Hawkins.

05:14.877 --> 05:19.959
And I hope your Palm Court exhibition
does justice to Mr. Selfridge's grand
vision, Miss Towler.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.889
But you can only do what you can do.

05:41.814 --> 05:44.725
Well, I'm looking forward to getting
out of London.

05:44.774 --> 05:46.803
It's so dreadfully hot.
Isn't it?

05:46.854 --> 05:49.835
And everyone's in such a stew about
war.

05:50.827 --> 05:52.846
Thoroughly dull, I agree.

05:53.866 --> 05:56.996
Yes, the country holds particular
attractions at the moment.

05:58.788 --> 06:01.938
And... will Lord Loxley be staying in
town, my lady?

06:02.937 --> 06:04.848
Yes, Pimble.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.898
Loxley will not be coming with us.

06:12.889 --> 06:14.810
Am I disturbing you?

06:14.860 --> 06:16.810
Yes... thank goodness.

06:16.861 --> 06:19.921
To hell with accounts. I
can't make them balance anyway.

06:19.971 --> 06:22.862
Too much money going out and
not enough coming in.

06:22.910 --> 06:24.943
Why is it always that way round?

06:24.994 --> 06:28.793
I did mean it, you know, about
investing in the club.

06:28.954 --> 06:32.815
Oh, thank you.
Well, it's a lovely offer

06:32.864 --> 06:35.744
and I have given it serious
consideration.

06:35.795 --> 06:38.743
But friendship and business do not go
together.

06:38.794 --> 06:40.745
Well, they should.

06:40.794 --> 06:43.757
They should go hand in hand. So I'm
not giving up on this one.

06:43.807 --> 06:45.758
I'm flattered.

06:45.807 --> 06:47.766
But I'm holding firm.

06:47.815 --> 06:50.006
For now.

06:51.808 --> 06:54.739
Actually it's, erm... friendship that
brings me here.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.809
I might be completely wrong but when
I was here the other night,

06:57.859 --> 06:59.858
I thought I saw someone that I know.

07:00.779 --> 07:02.780
His name's Henri Leclair.

07:03.820 --> 07:05.820
Henri Leclair?

07:06.920 --> 07:08.921
That name rings a bell.

07:09.882 --> 07:12.812
Was that the man last week asking
lots of questions?

07:12.862 --> 07:15.822
Didn't he leave his address?
Yeah. He left this.

07:22.954 --> 07:25.934
What would you want with him?
He used to work with Harry.

07:25.984 --> 07:27.985
They were close once.

07:30.927 --> 07:33.805
Are you sure, Rose? Because that's a
rough area.

07:33.856 --> 07:36.807
Oh, I've got a tougher streak than
you might think.

07:37.858 --> 07:42.978
Oh, by the way, Harry's secretary has
arranged for our guest, Senor
Gomerez,

07:43.028 --> 07:45.980
to do a tango demonstration for the
staff at the store. Oh.

07:46.028 --> 07:49.878
But I was rather hoping that you
could get them to hold it here.

07:49.929 --> 07:53.029
You can appreciate that it'd be very
good for business.

07:53.791 --> 07:56.801
And I do throw a good party, if I say
so myself.

07:56.851 --> 07:58.950
I'll see what I can do.

07:59.001 --> 08:00.942
Thanks, darling.

08:08.873 --> 08:10.945
Do I get to keep everything?
Everything.

08:12.933 --> 08:14.896
Even the ruby necklace?

08:14.946 --> 08:16.944
Especially the ruby necklace.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.906
I hope you'll miss me.

08:20.955 --> 08:23.007
I hope I don't... too much.

08:25.986 --> 08:29.038
Well, you know where to find me if
you change your mind. Mm.

08:35.889 --> 08:37.960
Cancel Miss Spender's account,
please.

08:41.798 --> 08:44.020
Actually... cancel all their accounts.

08:45.012 --> 08:47.010
All of them?
Yes.

08:49.942 --> 08:53.923
Telephone Mrs. Selfridge and let her
know I'll be home early for dinner.

08:59.863 --> 09:02.814
May I use some of our cosmetics for
the party, Miss Hawkins?

09:02.864 --> 09:04.815
Oh, I should think so.

09:04.865 --> 09:06.884
Miss Hawkins, how are you today?

09:07.816 --> 09:09.977
Not one bit shaken by the
demonstration this morning.

09:10.026 --> 09:12.867
If that's what you're wondering, Mr.
Edwards.

09:12.915 --> 09:14.947
You're looking for a story, I
presume?

09:14.997 --> 09:19.847
As a matter of fact, I'm here to
find a present for a very special
lady.

09:20.949 --> 09:24.879
Well, in that case, I'll leave you
in Miss Pertree's capable hands.

09:25.939 --> 09:28.790
Might I know something about her
coloring, sir?

09:28.840 --> 09:31.971
Well, one day her hair is golden.

09:32.020 --> 09:36.002
A shaft of sunlight and voilÃ  it
turns crimson.

09:36.941 --> 09:39.891
Sometimes her lips are pink petal
smooth.

09:40.893 --> 09:42.913
Other times there's a pearly sheen.

09:42.964 --> 09:44.892
Blue eyes.

09:44.942 --> 09:47.003
But then sometimes there's a hue of
violet.

09:47.054 --> 09:49.864
She's a difficult lady to pin down.

09:50.934 --> 09:52.894
But I'm sure I'll manage in time.

09:52.944 --> 09:54.946
She sounds lovely, sir.

09:56.006 --> 09:57.935
She is.

09:57.986 --> 10:00.937
A new perfume from the House of
Guerlain, perhaps?

10:00.987 --> 10:02.985
I'm sure she'd like that.

10:04.907 --> 10:06.908
Well, that looks erm...

10:13.848 --> 10:15.839
Yardley facial cream.

10:15.890 --> 10:17.890
Top of the range.

10:18.929 --> 10:21.951
Penhaligon soap, her complexion could
be quite sensitive,

10:22.002 --> 10:24.921
from what you describe.

10:25.951 --> 10:27.941
Lady Primrose hand lotion.

10:29.042 --> 10:31.003
She'll love the presentation.

10:31.053 --> 10:33.833
And the extra expense.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.854
If she's as hard to pin down as you
say, sir,

10:36.904 --> 10:38.994
you'll have to work all the harder,
won't you?

10:39.044 --> 10:41.044
If she's such a catch.

10:43.835 --> 10:47.837
Thank you for a very valuable lesson
in my wooing approach.

10:47.885 --> 10:49.847
You're quite welcome.

10:49.897 --> 10:51.897
Everybody has something to learn.

10:56.968 --> 11:01.030
I need you to get me in a room with
your shopkeeper friend.

11:03.890 --> 11:05.849
And why would I do that?

11:05.898 --> 11:07.860
There's a war coming.

11:07.910 --> 11:10.901
The military will need supplies.
He's the man to consult.

11:10.951 --> 11:13.971
Arrange a meeting and I'll take it
from there.

11:14.971 --> 11:17.932
How can you expect him to help you
after the way you behaved?

11:17.982 --> 11:19.982
Just do as I say.

11:20.943 --> 11:22.902
It will be to our mutual advantage.

11:22.953 --> 11:24.914
Trust me.

11:24.963 --> 11:28.924
That's the problem, Loxley. I never
have.

11:33.045 --> 11:35.946
You might find the country house a
tad crowded.

11:36.896 --> 11:39.966
It's been leased to a Dutch
industrialist as of yesterday.

11:42.987 --> 11:44.988
Chap likes fishing, apparently.

11:49.077 --> 11:53.849
You should have seen it, Mother.
Charlie Chaplin's the funniest fellow
ever.

11:53.900 --> 11:57.869
He starts the film drunk as
anything...

11:57.920 --> 12:01.021
Falls over, then puts his hat onto
some poor woman's head.

12:01.071 --> 12:05.811
What's it called? Tango Tangles?
Why is that?

12:05.862 --> 12:07.923
Because it's set in a music hall.
Oh!

12:07.973 --> 12:09.942
Come with us next time. You'd love
it.

12:09.993 --> 12:13.942
Oh, that sounds so fun. I will. I
will. It's a date.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.846
Night, Harry.

12:26.975 --> 12:28.978
I miss us.

12:30.007 --> 12:31.967
I love you, Rose.

12:32.017 --> 12:35.888
No matter what happened in the past,
I want you to know that.

12:37.878 --> 12:39.950
I know you're lonely sometimes.

12:41.080 --> 12:43.828
But that's for you to deal with.

12:43.879 --> 12:46.901
When you're in the States, it's not
just the house that feels empty.

12:46.950 --> 12:50.010
Harry... I can't give you everything
again.

12:50.971 --> 12:53.902
I'll just end up with a little less
of me each time.

12:54.082 --> 12:57.950
I don't want to hate you. There
isn't anybody but you now, Rose.

13:16.356 --> 13:17.976
Good morning, little one.

13:18.986 --> 13:21.898
Why, hello, Mr. Crabb.
Hello, Mrs. Grove.

13:22.918 --> 13:24.927
I haven't seen you for ages. How
nice.

13:24.977 --> 13:26.938
We hardly ever see anybody.

13:26.989 --> 13:29.828
Roger's always on about what good
friends you are.

13:29.877 --> 13:32.009
How are you these days?
In my element, Mr. Crabb.

13:32.059 --> 13:34.991
How could I not be with my little
angels around me?

13:36.051 --> 13:39.891
I thought I'd come this way
to work today. Walk in with you.

13:39.940 --> 13:41.881
Goodbye, my dear.

13:41.931 --> 13:43.932
Goodbye.

13:46.922 --> 13:49.833
Well? I'm waiting to be frog marched
in.

13:49.883 --> 13:51.912
I was trying to help, Mr. Grove.

13:53.093 --> 13:55.094
I don't need help!

14:02.895 --> 14:04.886
It's about fully respecting workers.

14:04.936 --> 14:07.107
Don't you need to go to a meeting
before signing up?

14:07.867 --> 14:10.878
You don't need to do any of that.
Just come along when ever you want.

14:10.927 --> 14:13.878
Gentlemen you're trespassing on
private property.

14:13.929 --> 14:15.939
We uphold the law, Mr...?

14:15.989 --> 14:18.869
Towler. George Towler.

14:18.920 --> 14:22.830
Arnold Huxton. Just letting London
workers know what we could offer
them.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.101
Look, I'm all for unions...
where they're needed.

14:25.931 --> 14:29.111
But I've worked here five years and
we rub along just fine without one.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.843
Take a look at our
vision for the future.

14:34.013 --> 14:37.882
We have a booth by Bond Street
Station if you want to get in touch.

14:37.932 --> 14:39.904
Thank you, Mr. Huxton.
Pleasure.

14:39.955 --> 14:41.955
Thank you very much.
Gents.

14:53.846 --> 14:57.247
Rose!
Hey, Harry.

14:59.007 --> 15:00.949
Good afternoon, Mr. Selfridge.

15:00.997 --> 15:02.998
Black coffee, Franco, thank you.

15:05.889 --> 15:07.989
Have you thought about what I said
last night?

15:08.039 --> 15:13.861
Harry, I just thought it would be
nice to take afternoon coffee with
you. That's all.

15:13.911 --> 15:15.870
Hm.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.932
That'll do me for now.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.903
What? I have the feeling you have
something to ask me?

15:26.934 --> 15:30.023
Delphine wondered if you'd hold the
staff party in her Club.

15:31.063 --> 15:33.064
What do you think?

15:35.044 --> 15:37.004
It makes more sense to have it here.

15:37.055 --> 15:39.125
A store event for people that work
here.

15:39.886 --> 15:41.986
But Harry, it would be such a treat
for them.

15:46.046 --> 15:51.018
I'm not sure. I mean, Delphine would
have to get it absolutely right.

15:52.058 --> 15:54.108
Well, she'd have every incentive to.

15:55.069 --> 15:57.969
I'm thinking of investing in the
club.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.850
Investing in her club?
Mm-hm.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.849
You think that's a wise move?

16:03.899 --> 16:06.891
Well, it's early days. We're still
negotiating.

16:10.002 --> 16:12.063
Now, what about this party, mm?

16:12.112 --> 16:15.913
Well, only because it's you...
I'll consider it.

16:30.946 --> 16:32.976
Miss Towler?
Yes, Mr. Thackeray.

16:33.027 --> 16:35.926
You were supposed to be at the
Fashion Department.

16:35.977 --> 16:37.997
Oh... ten minutes ago.

16:38.047 --> 16:40.068
Erm... Yes.

16:40.117 --> 16:44.089
I-I'm sorry, Mr. Thackeray. It's just
I've got an awful lot on.

16:44.138 --> 16:48.140
The luggage window display, the Palm
Court...

16:49.118 --> 16:51.942
I will get to you today, I promise.

16:51.989 --> 16:55.082
Let's say five o'clock. After
closing.

16:56.101 --> 16:58.101
Busy, busy bee, aren't we?

17:00.982 --> 17:02.981
I look forward to seeing you then.

17:27.068 --> 17:29.108
Hello, Henri.
Rose.

17:30.138 --> 17:32.098
It's been a long time.

17:32.148 --> 17:34.150
What are you doing here?

17:36.088 --> 17:38.051
Do you mind if I come in?

17:38.100 --> 17:40.101
Erm... no.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.151
How did you find me?

17:51.912 --> 17:53.912
I thought I saw you at Delphine's.

17:54.113 --> 17:57.022
At Delphine's? What were you doing at
Delphine's?

17:57.073 --> 17:59.034
She's a friend of mine.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.085
Really?

18:04.935 --> 18:06.935
You look well, Henri.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.057
You don't need to lie, Rose.

18:14.937 --> 18:17.108
A lot's changed since I saw you
last.

18:18.127 --> 18:20.128
Harry's changed.

18:22.979 --> 18:24.978
New York didn't work out for you?

18:25.948 --> 18:27.948
No.
I'm sorry.

18:29.101 --> 18:31.100
Get out, get out.

18:34.002 --> 18:38.001
I understand about that -
about... things not working out.

18:39.002 --> 18:41.982
You've got money, family, security.

18:43.963 --> 18:46.164
What exactly hasn't worked out for
you, Rose?

18:48.003 --> 18:52.084
I'm not here to talk about me.
I'm here to talk about Harry.

18:53.986 --> 18:58.097
He misses you. He feels very badly
about the way you two parted.

19:00.017 --> 19:03.007
If he feels so bad, why is it you are
here and not him?

19:03.056 --> 19:05.056
He doesn't know that I'm here.

19:06.077 --> 19:08.039
Harry really needs a true friend.

19:08.088 --> 19:12.908
And forgive me, Henri, but it looks
like...

19:12.959 --> 19:14.890
What?

19:14.941 --> 19:17.920
Well, it looks like you could do
with a friend too.

19:17.970 --> 19:19.971
I don't need charity.

19:20.152 --> 19:23.101
Henri, just... Why don't you let
Harry help you?

19:23.152 --> 19:26.961
I don't need Harry's help. I don't
care if I never see him again.

19:27.012 --> 19:28.932
Please, Rose.

19:30.932 --> 19:32.934
Goodbye.

19:50.047 --> 19:52.008
Miss Towler, at last.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.976
I said I'd get here, Mr. Thackeray.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.037
Indeed you did. And almost on time.

19:56.087 --> 19:59.179
In fact, I've requested Mr.
Selfridge's presence for our
meeting.

19:59.939 --> 20:01.119
And here he is now.

20:01.169 --> 20:04.929
Mr. Selfridge, thank you for giving
us a moment of your valuable time.

20:04.979 --> 20:06.920
What's this about, Thackeray?

20:06.971 --> 20:11.012
I've been thinking about your Empire
idea. Thinking hard, Mr. Selfridge.

20:11.060 --> 20:15.012
And?
Why not roll the idea out storewide?

20:15.992 --> 20:19.063
Every department. Showcase the best
of Britain and the colonies

20:19.114 --> 20:22.112
from the stationary department to up
here in fashion.

20:24.043 --> 20:26.956
I like it.
Make it a week long festival

20:27.005 --> 20:29.043
of all that is truly great about the
Empire.

20:29.094 --> 20:33.946
We'd be saying that you can trust us
at Selfridge's to put our best foot
forward at all times.

20:33.996 --> 20:35.936
And that we're here to stay.

20:35.987 --> 20:37.946
Trust, Mr. Selfridge.

20:37.995 --> 20:41.097
That's what people sorely lack in
these uncertain times.

20:43.097 --> 20:45.098
It's good thinking.

20:46.188 --> 20:49.099
A little more than you bargained for,
Miss Towler.

20:49.149 --> 20:51.108
Can you handle it?

20:51.159 --> 20:53.999
Of course, Mr. Selfridge.
Excellent.

20:54.049 --> 20:56.051
I look forward to all of your ideas.

20:59.981 --> 21:01.911
As do I.

21:01.962 --> 21:05.952
Do let me know if I can...
assist you in any way at all.

21:18.975 --> 21:20.975
Good morning, Mae.

21:27.066 --> 21:29.997
Have you arranged my meeting with
Selfridge? Mm.

21:30.997 --> 21:33.078
I spoke to his secretary.
He's traveling.

21:33.129 --> 21:35.128
Very busy man.

21:38.969 --> 21:41.159
I hope that you're not lying to me,
Mae.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.101
What are you going to do?

21:46.061 --> 21:48.030
Blackmail me?

21:48.080 --> 21:50.090
As you blackmailed your friend?

21:57.962 --> 21:59.964
Don't play games with me.

22:02.073 --> 22:07.163
You will smooth everything over with
Selfridge.

22:11.035 --> 22:13.037
Never forget...

22:13.086 --> 22:15.056
all you have...

22:15.105 --> 22:17.107
is the Loxley name.

22:19.097 --> 22:21.097
I can take it from you like that.

22:35.160 --> 22:37.121
Hello, Victor.

22:37.170 --> 22:40.161
I've ordered white lilies for the
Champagne Bar.

22:41.129 --> 22:44.022
Sounds good.
And for the Empire Exhibition...

22:44.072 --> 22:48.022
I've... I've got some ideas for
designs.

22:49.003 --> 22:52.165
I was thinking we could put display
cabinets all along this wall.

22:52.214 --> 22:55.115
And hang mounted photographs here.

22:55.164 --> 22:57.115
And erm...

22:57.164 --> 23:00.156
Maybe drape flags from the ceiling
or...

23:03.096 --> 23:05.058
Erm... I'm sorry.

23:05.106 --> 23:09.037
I know that it was my idea to use
your restaurant for the exhibition.

23:09.088 --> 23:13.038
I just thought that a contained area
would be an easier space to dress.

23:13.089 --> 23:15.128
Sounds like you've got a lot on your
plate.

23:15.178 --> 23:17.158
But you seem to be coping well
enough.

23:17.209 --> 23:20.189
Actually, I'm finding it all rather
daunting.

23:21.219 --> 23:23.221
Same here from time to time.

23:24.192 --> 23:26.191
Excuse me.

23:28.992 --> 23:30.952
Oh, yes, of course.

23:31.002 --> 23:34.143
Sorry. I didn't mean to take up your
time unnecessarily.

23:42.025 --> 23:44.075
Late finish, early start.

23:45.085 --> 23:47.205
The perils of running your own
business.

23:54.016 --> 23:55.977
Looks different during the day.

23:56.026 --> 23:58.068
I didn't know that you'd been here
before.

23:58.118 --> 24:00.116
Rose said it wasn't your thing.

24:01.127 --> 24:04.219
She tells me that you offered to host
the party for my staff.

24:06.009 --> 24:08.210
That's a pretty big money-making
venture for you.

24:10.169 --> 24:13.060
I won't lie to you, I'm pretty skint
at the moment.

24:13.109 --> 24:16.062
And an event like that would help,
yes.

24:16.113 --> 24:20.071
Unlike you, Mr. Selfridge, I can't go
to the bank to borrow.

24:20.991 --> 24:22.991
An unmarried woman has no leverage.

24:23.203 --> 24:26.122
Well, I have to think about my store.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.233
About the Selfridge name.

24:28.993 --> 24:32.015
I don't want anything to bring that
into disrepute.

24:32.064 --> 24:35.155
Are you talking about the store
or your wife now?

24:35.205 --> 24:37.164
Both.

24:37.214 --> 24:41.176
Rose told me that she's thinking
about investing in this club.

24:41.226 --> 24:44.187
That was her idea, not mine. I don't
think it would work.

24:44.237 --> 24:47.006
But she was pretty excited about it.

24:47.057 --> 24:49.077
Rose is a little bit restless at the
moment.

24:49.128 --> 24:51.150
Can I give you some advice?

24:51.198 --> 24:54.149
Miss Day... we've had our problems.

24:55.049 --> 24:59.129
But we will sort them out.
If you love her, trust her.

24:59.180 --> 25:02.030
Thank you very much. I'll keep that
in mind.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.041
But I am going to tell you something.

25:04.090 --> 25:07.181
I think that I know my wife a lot
better than you do.

25:14.093 --> 25:17.032
Signing up, are you?
Just interested.

25:17.083 --> 25:20.194
You're all right. You've got your pa
to look out for your interests.

25:20.244 --> 25:24.045
Now, come on, Dave. He's down here
learning from scratch, ain't he?

25:24.095 --> 25:26.975
All I was saying, Mr. Towler, is if
he's got the right

25:27.025 --> 25:29.026
to read that pamphlet, so do we.

25:29.075 --> 25:31.116
That's right Ed. My dad swears by his
union.

25:31.166 --> 25:34.137
We should at least have the right to
talk about joining one.

25:34.188 --> 25:36.108
You two need to get a grip.

25:36.157 --> 25:39.088
And if you're so unhappy, go and
speak to Mr. Grove.

25:39.137 --> 25:41.137
See what he has to say about it.

25:42.118 --> 25:44.099
Yeah, well, maybe we'll do just
that.

25:44.150 --> 25:46.149
Yeah, maybe we will.

25:47.158 --> 25:49.161
Come on.
Yeah.

25:55.031 --> 25:58.083
W-We're here to formally ask for the
right to investigate entry

25:58.132 --> 26:01.163
to the trade union for warehouse
workers.

26:06.222 --> 26:10.065
You knew our policy with regard to
that when you sought employment.

26:10.115 --> 26:13.194
We already have a staff council if
you need something addressed.

26:13.243 --> 26:18.135
Well, yes, but... can't we even -
There's been no change of policy.

26:18.186 --> 26:20.167
Now return to your stations, please.

26:29.169 --> 26:31.169
Selfridge can shove his party.

26:32.229 --> 26:35.991
Tell the lads gather in the loading
bay at seven this evening.

26:36.039 --> 26:38.040
Oh, I will.

26:48.171 --> 26:50.212
Gordon. Everything all right?

26:50.262 --> 26:54.043
I think some of the men see your
party as a way of buying them off

26:54.093 --> 26:56.094
from talking to the unions.

26:58.153 --> 27:01.184
I don't mean it that way.
I just thought you should know.

27:04.186 --> 27:07.155
Son, there'll be days when you'll sit
in that chair

27:07.205 --> 27:10.997
when it'll seem like you just can't
do right for doing wrong.

27:11.046 --> 27:13.257
So what do I do, then?
You do what you think is right.

27:15.258 --> 27:18.087
And then you pay the price if you get
it wrong.

27:24.199 --> 27:29.031
'My dear Lady Mae, you're greatly
missed at the store.

27:29.080 --> 27:33.021
Please join us for a social gathering
at Delphine's.

27:33.071 --> 27:35.073
I'll send a car.'

27:35.123 --> 27:38.001
It appears that he's returned from
his travels.

27:38.052 --> 27:41.032
Delphine's? I'm not going.

27:42.032 --> 27:43.995
Oh, you're going.

27:44.043 --> 27:46.064
And what's more...

27:47.175 --> 27:49.175
..I'm coming with you.

28:03.668 --> 28:06.600
I can't believe we're going to
Delphine's tonight!

28:06.648 --> 28:08.679
I've borrowed tortoise shell hair
combs

28:09.438 --> 28:12.408
and a fan trimmed with Spanish lace
from accessories.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.530
Nice to be open about wearing rouge,
Grace.

28:14.579 --> 28:17.599
About time us girls didn't have to
keep our personals secret.

28:17.648 --> 28:20.410
You're so daring, Jessie. How d'you
do it?

28:20.461 --> 28:22.541
I just look to see how Miss Hawkins
does things.

28:22.591 --> 28:25.480
One of you lucky ladies might get a
dance tonight.

28:25.531 --> 28:28.603
You might be the one who
gets lucky, Mr. Colleano.

28:29.503 --> 28:31.663
Ooh! Playing hard to get are we,
Miss Pertree?

28:39.474 --> 28:41.436
Evening.

28:41.485 --> 28:43.526
Ah! Do you want a ride to the party,
son?

28:43.575 --> 28:46.445
Actually, I've got a lot to catch up
on here.

28:46.495 --> 28:49.617
Is that true or are you getting
pressure from the men down here?

28:50.677 --> 28:52.678
I can make up my own mind.

28:55.578 --> 28:57.579
Well, I'd like you to be there.

28:58.559 --> 29:01.529
No shame in changing your mind if you
decide to come.

29:08.591 --> 29:10.590
Thank you.

29:12.659 --> 29:14.523
Nice enough, I suppose.

29:14.572 --> 29:19.493
If my mam saw me in this place, I'd
be back in the Valleys faster than I
could pack a bag.

29:26.475 --> 29:28.585
Mind you don't crack it. Seven years'
bad luck.

29:28.634 --> 29:32.426
No cracking mirrors tonight, Victor.
I'm feeling lucky.

29:32.475 --> 29:35.518
This is a works do. So it's still
Mr. Colleano to you.

29:50.619 --> 29:52.630
Evening, chaps.
Evening.

29:53.689 --> 29:59.531
Mr. Arnold Huxton is here to tell us
what signing up for the Warehouse
Workers' Union can do for us.

30:07.533 --> 30:10.463
It is a pleasure to see so many of
you here.

30:10.513 --> 30:12.452
This is your party,

30:12.503 --> 30:15.514
so leave your cares behind at the
door for one night.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.515
It won't change the future

30:17.566 --> 30:21.506
but we will face whatever comes our
way together.

30:21.556 --> 30:25.587
Understand we are here for you when
nobody else is.

30:26.477 --> 30:29.618
In these uncertain times, who is
looking out for the rights of the
workers?

30:29.667 --> 30:33.497
How are your interests protected
if not by us?

30:33.548 --> 30:35.508
It may be my name on the door...

30:35.559 --> 30:40.580
but behind that door, you are the
ones who matter.

30:40.629 --> 30:43.620
So eat, drink and be merry.

30:44.601 --> 30:47.501
That is an order.

30:48.581 --> 30:50.541
â™ª El Choclo

31:42.692 --> 31:47.504
For now, we are just looking for
shorter hours and better pay.

31:47.554 --> 31:51.463
But I have a vision that goes much
further than that.

31:51.513 --> 31:54.726
Let me tell you where the future
lies for workers in this country.

31:57.545 --> 31:59.676
Everything all right with you and
Thackeray?

32:00.605 --> 32:05.546
You made it quite clear earlier that
you weren't interested in listening
to my problems.

32:05.596 --> 32:07.597
I didn't mean to cut you off.

32:08.617 --> 32:13.549
It's just... I don't know what way to
be with you now.

32:16.519 --> 32:18.520
What's going on with us?

32:19.600 --> 32:21.601
There is no 'us', Victor.

32:22.600 --> 32:26.630
Look, it's been a really long day.
I think I'm just going to go home.

32:50.576 --> 32:52.676
There is trouble brewing on the
continent.

32:52.725 --> 32:54.688
Some say war will come.

32:54.737 --> 32:57.639
Will the great Mr. Selfridge look out
for you?

32:57.687 --> 33:01.648
Your jobs and your loved ones if you
have to go and fight?

33:01.699 --> 33:04.599
Will you accept... with my apologies?

33:05.738 --> 33:07.690
Apologies for what?

33:07.740 --> 33:10.538
For making assumptions, Miss
Hawkins.

33:11.570 --> 33:13.532
I won't make the same mistake again.

33:13.579 --> 33:16.661
In fact I promise to work very, very
hard

33:16.711 --> 33:19.681
to make you see me in a more worthy
light.

33:21.552 --> 33:23.464
I'll accept your gift.

33:23.514 --> 33:24.713
I need a volunteer.

33:36.684 --> 33:38.686
I'll talk you through it.

33:39.606 --> 33:41.568
Don't worry if you stumble at first.

34:04.710 --> 34:07.492
Why should we put up with shoddy work
conditions?

34:07.541 --> 34:10.483
The rich are staying rich and the
poor are getting poorer.

34:10.533 --> 34:11.661
It's time to turn the tables.

34:11.712 --> 34:14.703
Think about how Selfridge would treat
you if you got ill?

34:19.694 --> 34:21.693
Tell him, Ed.

34:22.685 --> 34:26.565
Look, Mr. Huxton... the things that
you're promising us...

34:27.666 --> 34:30.576
..we already have.
The store has a full-time nurse.

34:30.626 --> 34:32.558
Dentist comes every week.

34:32.608 --> 34:35.558
There's all sorts of schemes for
betterment and education.

34:45.730 --> 34:49.659
If you've got it so good, why did you
ask me here tonight? I'm wasting my
time!

34:53.701 --> 34:59.523
I guarantee you'll come crawling back
to us when Selfridge runs off to
America at the first sign of war.

34:59.573 --> 35:02.521
That's my father you're talking
about and he is not a coward.

35:02.572 --> 35:04.493
Did you know he was here?
No.

35:04.543 --> 35:06.544
You need to get out of here now.

35:26.600 --> 35:27.768
Go on, get him out!

35:38.620 --> 35:40.621
Bravo!

35:46.761 --> 35:51.523
Well, I have to hand it to you, Miss
Day, you know how to put on a show.
Well done.

35:51.573 --> 35:55.643
I'm glad you're pleased. I could
tell that you were doubtful this
afternoon.

35:57.643 --> 35:59.544
You were here earlier?

35:59.595 --> 36:02.555
Yes, I just wanted to check out the
venue for myself.

36:04.546 --> 36:06.545
â™ª Magnetic Rag

36:17.558 --> 36:19.598
Good of you to invite us along,
Selfridge.

36:19.649 --> 36:21.649
A charming display.

36:23.549 --> 36:26.601
Well, as I recall, I extended the
invitation to Lady Mae.

36:26.651 --> 36:29.641
Thank you so much for coming,
Lady Mae.

36:30.701 --> 36:32.660
Selfridge, while I'm here,

36:32.710 --> 36:35.622
it behoves me to bring up the matter
of her bill.

36:35.672 --> 36:39.592
Nothing to bring up. You closed her
account. We're done on that subject.

36:39.643 --> 36:43.514
A fit of pique on a trying day, you
understand.

36:43.563 --> 36:46.784
Our outstandings will be settled in
due course. Maybe you didn't hear me.

36:47.544 --> 36:49.524
I don't need your money.

36:49.574 --> 36:51.785
Well, if it's all behind us,

36:52.545 --> 36:54.606
I want to discuss some business with
you.

36:54.656 --> 36:58.567
Lord Loxley, this is a party.
Your timing is inappropriate.

36:59.607 --> 37:04.699
Perhaps my lovely wife can persuade
you to hear what I have to say?

37:05.708 --> 37:07.707
Mae?

37:08.688 --> 37:10.689
Oh, I agree with Mr. Selfridge.

37:11.681 --> 37:14.549
This is neither the time nor the
place, dear.

37:15.559 --> 37:17.670
Why don't you stay and having a
couple of drinks?

37:17.721 --> 37:19.721
They're also on the house.

37:23.751 --> 37:26.561
What were you doing, spying on us
like that?

37:26.612 --> 37:29.653
I just wanted to hear what the man
had to say, same as you.

37:30.694 --> 37:32.735
I am working in the Loading Bay.

37:33.653 --> 37:36.705
See Dave? There's them...
Then there's us.

37:37.715 --> 37:39.716
Ever the same.

37:43.575 --> 37:45.536
You're all right, Selfridge.

37:45.587 --> 37:47.737
Ed would be the first to stick up for
his old man.

37:55.789 --> 37:57.738
Are you sure I can't arrange a car
for you?

37:57.789 --> 38:01.678
Thanks, but we're going to walk.
I have a little surprise for Rose.

38:01.728 --> 38:03.691
I'm not sure about this.

38:03.741 --> 38:05.700
Enjoy your evening, ladies.

38:05.751 --> 38:07.751
Good night.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.801
So what's the surprise?

38:12.563 --> 38:14.642
Oh... Just a second, Rose.

38:16.593 --> 38:18.662
Come with us, Mr. Selfridge. Come on.

38:18.712 --> 38:22.544
All work and no play.
I don't want to get in the way.

38:22.593 --> 38:25.716
Don't be silly. Come on. It's a
beautiful evening.

38:28.565 --> 38:30.565
â™ª Magnetic Rag

38:50.691 --> 38:53.669
Mm, jellied eels - the finest London
has to offer.

38:53.718 --> 38:55.699
Come on. Where's your sense of
adventure?

38:55.750 --> 38:58.552
Life isn't all fancy restaurants,
you know.

38:58.602 --> 39:01.641
You need to try what your staff eat.
You're full of surprises, Miss Day.

39:01.692 --> 39:03.542
You have no idea.

39:03.593 --> 39:06.622
Mr. Grove? Are you feeling quite well?

39:07.644 --> 39:09.544
I'm drunk, I think.

39:09.593 --> 39:11.554
How pleasant.
It's not pleasant.

39:11.603 --> 39:13.604
How unpleasant, then.

39:14.744 --> 39:16.745
Do you ever wonder...

39:18.735 --> 39:21.625
..what paths you might have taken?

39:22.646 --> 39:24.567
Paths?

39:24.617 --> 39:26.648
In life! In life! In life!

39:26.696 --> 39:28.647
Paths in life!
Oh, yes.

39:28.697 --> 39:31.758
I mean, Doris is a sweet girl and
she's a wonderful mother.

39:31.809 --> 39:34.647
As you know, she's with child once
more.

39:35.599 --> 39:37.608
That'll make... four.

39:38.759 --> 39:40.729
That's quite a handful.

39:40.778 --> 39:43.741
My life is chaos, Mr. Crabb.

39:45.792 --> 39:48.610
Utter, utter chaos.

39:50.823 --> 39:56.733
I don't know when I last had a
good... night's sleep.

39:59.673 --> 40:01.634
And when it is quiet...

40:01.684 --> 40:05.555
I lie awake, worrying about my
girls.

40:05.605 --> 40:07.675
How will they be affected if war
comes?

40:07.725 --> 40:09.675
It's terrifying.

40:09.726 --> 40:11.746
War brings changes, Roger.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.746
We'll have to adapt.

40:14.796 --> 40:16.797
Your daughters will adapt.

40:17.798 --> 40:20.736
And we will do what we can to help
our young men...

40:21.738 --> 40:23.739
..in every way that we can.

40:24.629 --> 40:26.819
From the store?
Of course from the store.

40:33.710 --> 40:35.700
You know, I think...

40:36.772 --> 40:39.731
..as long as His Majesty has men of
your calibre...

40:41.591 --> 40:43.593
..we shall be all right.

40:46.732 --> 40:50.734
You're a true friend and a decent
gentleman.

40:51.825 --> 40:53.825
Steady on, old stick.

40:55.594 --> 40:56.835
Mm!

40:59.825 --> 41:02.677
It's quite a... strong taste.

41:03.717 --> 41:05.677
What do you think, Harry?

41:05.727 --> 41:08.647
Not much, I'm afraid.

41:10.668 --> 41:14.598
Nearly as bad as those snails we had
in Paris last time we were there.

41:14.829 --> 41:19.599
That reminds me, Rose. Did you find
your mysterious Frenchman?

41:19.649 --> 41:21.651
Mysterious Frenchman? Do tell.

41:24.811 --> 41:28.581
Erm... I saw Henri.

41:28.632 --> 41:30.703
I went to his lodgings.
Henri Leclair?

41:31.731 --> 41:33.753
He's in London and you didn't tell
me?

41:38.613 --> 41:41.703
It all... backfired on me, anyway.

41:45.614 --> 41:47.726
Harry... I'll leave you ladies to
your supper.

41:47.776 --> 41:49.726
Harry...
I'll see you at home, Rose.

41:49.776 --> 41:52.637
Harry, wait! Harry, let me explain!

41:59.727 --> 42:02.678
Why did you do that? Delphine...

42:02.727 --> 42:06.669
I was going to explain to Harry about
Henri in my own time.

42:06.719 --> 42:08.650
I'm sorry, Rose.

42:08.700 --> 42:10.701
I didn't mean to make trouble.

42:19.721 --> 42:22.723
Gordon! You were working until now?

42:24.853 --> 42:26.854
I went to a trade union meeting.

42:29.695 --> 42:31.654
Are you all right, son?
I'm fine.

42:31.704 --> 42:34.845
Things got a bit heated but...
it all got sorted in the end.

42:36.626 --> 42:38.776
I just... wanted to see what it was
all about.

42:40.736 --> 42:42.737
Well, you're your own man now, son.

42:43.697 --> 42:47.718
I understand if you need to look at
different sides to different stories.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.648
Night, Pa.

42:57.810 --> 42:59.808
How it must sting...

43:01.771 --> 43:04.742
..being made to look a fool of by a
lowly shopkeeper.

43:19.774 --> 43:21.775
I'm sorry about Henri, Harry.

43:22.716 --> 43:25.695
Tell me where he is and I'll go see
him first thing in the morning.

43:25.745 --> 43:27.745
I don't think that's a good idea.

43:29.787 --> 43:31.627
Why not?

43:31.676 --> 43:33.777
Things haven't turned out too well
for him.

43:36.709 --> 43:39.708
You should have at least just talked
to me about this.

43:39.759 --> 43:42.700
Well, you don't involve me in every
part of your life.

43:42.750 --> 43:45.619
You went to Delphine's today without
telling me.

43:45.670 --> 43:48.721
That is completely different. Henri
is an old and trusted friend.

43:48.770 --> 43:51.851
Harry, I meant well.
I'm not going to apologise again.

43:53.781 --> 43:55.742
We used to share everything Rose.

43:55.792 --> 43:58.613
That is what marriage is supposed to
be about.

43:58.662 --> 44:00.623
Oh, Harry, that's you all over.

44:00.673 --> 44:03.633
You want marriage when it suits you
and drop it when it doesn't.

44:03.684 --> 44:07.615
I told you... I am trying to make
things right.

44:07.666 --> 44:10.615
I am not the one who made a mess of
this marriage. You are!

44:10.665 --> 44:13.796
So you have to live with the
consequences. God knows I've had to.
