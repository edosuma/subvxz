AKU: Long ago,
in a distant land,

00:04.923 --> 00:09.302
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.385 --> 00:12.805
unleashed an unspeakable evil.

00:13.097 --> 00:18.645
But a foolish samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword,

00:18.728 --> 00:21.606
stepped forth to oppose me.

00:24.234 --> 00:26.528
Before the final blow
was struck,

00:26.611 --> 00:29.113
I tore open a portal in time

00:29.197 --> 00:33.993
and flung him into the future,
where my evil is law.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.997
Now the fool seeks to return
to the past

00:38.081 --> 00:43.044
And undo the future that is Aku.
