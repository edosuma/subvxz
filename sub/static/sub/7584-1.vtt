00:57.599 --> 00:59.146
Come on, Jack.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.563
- Just pull the damn trigger.

01:14.116 --> 01:15.208
I can't.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.304
<i>My brother Forrest once said,</i>

02:17.471 --> 02:20.600
<i>"Nothing can kill us.
We can't never die."</i>

02:20.766 --> 02:22.643
<i>The reason being
that in the great war,</i>

02:22.809 --> 02:24.903
<i>my eldest brother, Howard,
saw his entire battalion</i>

02:25.228 --> 02:26.445
<i>drown in the sea.</i>

02:26.605 --> 02:28.357
<i>Every last one of them.</i>

02:29.691 --> 02:31.318
<i>He was the only survivor.</i>

02:34.488 --> 02:36.866
<i>And Forrest, well,
that same year,</i>

02:37.199 --> 02:38.576
<i>Spanish Lady ﬂu hit Franklin,</i>

02:38.742 --> 02:40.961
<i>damn near wiped out
the entire state.</i>

02:41.119 --> 02:42.621
<i>It got Ma and Pa and Forrest</i>

02:42.788 --> 02:44.381
<i>but against all the odds,</i>

02:44.539 --> 02:47.133
<i>he somehow managed
to fight it off.</i>

02:47.292 --> 02:49.465
<i>So you could see
why Forrest felt that way.</i>

02:52.339 --> 02:54.592
<i>Me and my brothers
are moonshiners.</i>

02:54.758 --> 02:55.930
<i>Bootleggers.</i>

02:56.259 --> 02:58.136
<i>In 1920, they passed
the Prohibition Act</i>

02:58.303 --> 03:00.021
<i>making the sale
of alcohol illegal.</i>

03:00.847 --> 03:03.316
<i>Well, at least
it was supposed to be.</i>

03:03.475 --> 03:04.977
You want a case, Sheriff?

03:05.143 --> 03:08.773
- Morning, Forrest.
- Pure corn whiskey.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.316
That there's the white lightning, Sheriff.

03:10.482 --> 03:11.904
It'll come at you like a knife,

03:12.067 --> 03:13.785
pointy end first,
sharp and hot all the way down.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.992
Aw, damn it. Give me two.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.201
All right, then.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.455
- You all right there?
- Thanks, boys.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.836
Always happy to oblige
an officer of the law.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.628
<i>They called Franklin
the wettest county in the world</i>

03:30.794 --> 03:34.344
<i>on account of almost everybody
was making the stuff.</i>

03:34.506 --> 03:36.884
<i>Now, you can make moonshine whiskey
from just about anything.</i>

03:37.217 --> 03:39.515
Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
Hey, Selma.

03:39.678 --> 03:42.932
<i>Turnips, pumpkins,
blackberries, cornmeal, tree bark.</i>

03:43.265 --> 03:44.687
- Anything.
- All right, then.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.948
He's so fucking sick, man, can't get
himself out the bed to tend the stills.

03:52.274 --> 03:54.322
- You want me to take it up to him?
- No, I can do it.

03:54.484 --> 03:57.829
<i>And at night, in them hills,</i>

03:57.988 --> 03:59.786
<i>you could see them fires
from the stills burning</i>

03:59.948 --> 04:02.292
<i>like lights on a damn Christmas tree.</i>

04:03.744 --> 04:07.419
<i>Over the mountains, in the cities,</i>

04:07.581 --> 04:10.460
<i>there was the biggest crime
wave this country'd ever seen.</i>

04:10.625 --> 04:13.048
<i>- And all that illegal liquor</i>

04:13.211 --> 04:16.464
<i>was ﬂowing down from the hills
to the cities by the truckload.</i>

04:19.050 --> 04:22.270
<i>Gangsters were just scooping money
off the streets like candy.</i>

04:22.429 --> 04:25.979
<i>They had men like Al Capone,
Tommy Maloy,</i>

04:26.141 --> 04:28.360
<i>that mad dog Floyd Banner.</i>

04:28.518 --> 04:30.566
<i>They just moved in and took over.</i>

04:32.272 --> 04:35.367
<i>Meanwhile, we were hauling stuff around
in our old, beat-up jalopies.</i>

04:42.783 --> 04:45.582
All right now, Jack,
I want you to stay here.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.291
- What?
- Stay in the truck.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.003
Ain't like someone's gonna steal
this piece of shit, Forrest.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.505
Just do what you're told, Jack.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.893
- All right, Forrest, go on.

05:27.369 --> 05:30.714
Amen! Amen!

05:30.872 --> 05:32.795
Here we go. All right, then.

05:32.958 --> 05:34.301
Get some of this.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.971
Welcome, welcome.
How're you boys doing?

05:42.133 --> 05:43.931
Sorry to hear about Little Bean,
Ida Belle.

05:44.094 --> 05:47.064
You know Little Bean loved
his gals and his giggle water.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.983
She sure is giving him
one hell of a send-off.

05:52.143 --> 05:55.147
Give me your money, boy.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.405
Yeah, you do as I say

05:56.565 --> 05:59.114
or I'm gonna cut you.
- Hold on, now, I ain't got nothing.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.823
I'm just a driver.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.158
You boys staying?

06:02.320 --> 06:03.947
No, we gotta be getting off, Ida Belle.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.411
Come on, Forrest, one damn drink.

06:05.574 --> 06:06.951
No, we better be getting back now.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.336
You ever seen a Harlem sunset?

06:09.494 --> 06:11.462
Well, I'm fixing
to cut one right into you...

06:11.621 --> 06:12.622
I ain't got nothing.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.336
...If you don't hand over
that goddamn money.

06:14.499 --> 06:15.341
Motherfucker.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.877
Here, I'll take care of this.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.341
Hey you, come on now,
you don't want to do this.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.098
Why don't you put that knife away,
take you and your friends on home?

06:22.257 --> 06:24.305
I'd listen to him if I was you.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.137
You the boss?

06:27.304 --> 06:29.932
You just sold a load to those
dinges in there, didn't you?

06:30.932 --> 06:34.607
You hand over that cash or I'm gonna
cut some daylight into you.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.857
Listen here, mister.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.321
We got no way of
understanding this world.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.871
We got about as much sense of it
as a bird flying in the sky.

06:44.613 --> 06:46.490
There is a lot that bird don't know.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.704
But it don't change the fact that

06:48.867 --> 06:52.167
the world is happening to him
all the same.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.042
What I'm trying to say is...

06:54.205 --> 06:58.085
...is that the course of your life,
it is changing.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.050
- You don't even see it.
- What are you talking about?

07:07.218 --> 07:08.515
Let's go!

07:09.387 --> 07:11.560
Yep.
That's what he's talking about.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.693
- Yeah, all right now.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.194
You all right there, Jack?

07:16.519 --> 07:18.567
Just caught me off guard is all.

07:19.481 --> 07:21.279
You still good to drive?

07:22.233 --> 07:23.985
- Fuck you, Howard.
- Oh, whatever you say,

07:24.152 --> 07:26.701
- Little doggie.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.694
All right, Jack, come on,
we gotta go set up over here.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.204
Thank you.

08:16.371 --> 08:17.623
Finest apple?

08:19.457 --> 08:20.959
All right, then.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.764
Are you gonna talk to Forrest about
taking some of me and Cricket's liquor?

08:26.923 --> 08:29.517
- We're working on somethin' big.
- What do you mean talk to him?

08:29.676 --> 08:31.098
About letting us in, Howard.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.104
Not with that damn popskull shit
you been cooking up.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.265
- We're still perfecting it.
- Perfecting it, my ass,

08:35.432 --> 08:38.025
Jack, that shit
ain't fit to slop hogs.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.107
Forrest don't want you involved, is all.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.272
Why is that?

08:42.605 --> 08:44.607
'Cause he don't think you got the grit.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.993
Gimme another jar, Jack. Huh?

08:47.777 --> 08:51.327
You might wanna slow down some,
Howard. We're trying to sell this stuff.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.209
- Who is that?
- She's one of them crazies

08:59.539 --> 09:01.291
from that church at Burnt Chimney.

09:01.624 --> 09:05.174
Her daddy over there,
he's gonna be the preacher.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.885
You wanna get yourself a crowbar, Jack,
if you wanna get inside of her.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.142
She don't look that crazy.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.723
Her daddy don't look too happy, neither.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.646
All right, now.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.358
Jack, go on and
take this around the back.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.147
Store whatever's left in the shed.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.442
You too, Howard.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.161
- Come on, Jack.
- Yeah.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.873
Are you Forrest Bondurant?

09:43.708 --> 09:45.005
Um...

09:46.294 --> 09:47.921
I'm Maggie Beaufort.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.980
They say in town you're looking for
someone to help out 'round the place.

10:02.602 --> 10:06.027
- Is that position still vacant?

10:06.189 --> 10:08.442
Forgive me for asking, but, um...

10:10.318 --> 10:12.696
...what does a lady like you...

10:12.862 --> 10:15.581
...want here?

10:15.740 --> 10:17.834
The city can grind a girl down.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.918
Gets to a point where you start
looking for somewhere quiet.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.087
Damn.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.969
Well, Mr. Bondurant...

10:41.182 --> 10:43.276
...do I get the job?

11:44.370 --> 11:45.337
Quick. Quick.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.051
Hey!

13:18.214 --> 13:19.466
Cricket!

13:19.799 --> 13:21.221
Hey!

13:22.260 --> 13:24.308
- Hey!

13:26.597 --> 13:28.144
You ain't never gonna believe
what I just seen.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.528
Floyd Banner shoot the tires
out of a goddamn ATU car

13:31.686 --> 13:33.780
right smack in the middle of
town with a goddamn Tommy gun.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.030
- Floyd Banner?
- Floyd Banner.

13:35.189 --> 13:38.819
Oh, hey, look here. In the middle
of all that, I was thinking about you.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.245
Got you one of these shell cases, Cricket.

13:41.404 --> 13:42.576
- Oh, thanks, Jack!
- Yeah.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.578
Figured we could put holes in it,
you know.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.285
Put a chain through it, hang it around
our necks for luck or something.

13:48.119 --> 13:52.545
Floyd Banner.
He looked like he had direction, vision.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.087
You got smoke coming out the cabin.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.890
Jesus Christ, Cricket.

14:03.134 --> 14:05.262
- This gonna work?
- Naturally,

14:05.428 --> 14:08.602
I'm still messing with
the recipe, of course.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.808
And with this set-up through the pipes,

14:10.975 --> 14:12.852
no one'll even know it's down here.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.204
The man tucks away his bottle,
out he goes.

14:28.576 --> 14:32.251
Well... Partner, I don't know if
that's the stupidest thing I ever seen

14:32.413 --> 14:34.415
or you're some kind
of damn genius.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.303
- Ooh.
- Mm-hm.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.095
Did Jimmy pay us?

14:47.261 --> 14:49.355
- Yup.
- He did?

14:59.732 --> 15:01.075
Thank you.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.128
Hi, Forrest.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.515
This here's the new Special Deputy.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.683
He's been brought in
from the city to help us out.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.979
You know, make sure things go smooth.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.692
What things might they be?

16:22.273 --> 16:23.820
Sorry, something amuse you?

16:26.152 --> 16:28.621
My name is Charlie Rakes,
I'm from Chicago.

16:30.364 --> 16:33.208
That damn brother of yours,
is he somewhere about?

16:40.917 --> 16:41.668
Who's in the car?

16:42.001 --> 16:45.221
That there's the new
Commonwealth's Attorney, Mason Wardell.

16:46.255 --> 16:50.601
He wants to work it out so everybody
gets to do some business.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.357
Henry,
go see what Mr. Wardell wants.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.619
Pete, who the hell is this son of a bitch?

17:12.781 --> 17:16.537
Me? I'm the one who's going to make
your life real difficult from now on

17:16.702 --> 17:19.125
if you don't toe the line, country boy.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.759
Don't you ever touch me again.

17:23.917 --> 17:28.013
- All right, all right.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.596
Forrest, it already settled.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.102
The whole county's gonna
get on board eventually.

17:33.261 --> 17:36.435
Start at $20 a week, $30 a load

17:36.597 --> 17:38.565
and that gets you free passage
throughout the whole county.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.523
- No one'll bother you.
- Don't nobody bother me now.

17:42.144 --> 17:47.025
Mr. Wardell, he'd like a jar
of your finest apple brandy.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.534
That be all right?

18:13.551 --> 18:15.895
Can I help you, son?

18:16.053 --> 18:17.521
Yeah.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.479
You send your clown
with the bow tie around here again,

18:20.641 --> 18:23.815
and I guarantee you'll personally
pull a cleaver out of his fucking skull.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.275
You understand me?

18:29.025 --> 18:31.073
You're gonna regret this, Forrest.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.329
He's already regretting it,
he's just too ignorant to know it yet.

18:33.487 --> 18:34.488
Go on, go inside now.

18:43.497 --> 18:45.545
You thinking of drawing on me?

19:11.400 --> 19:13.994
Say your piece, Jimmy.
I got a business to run.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.123
All right, Forrest.
Now we got a chance

19:18.282 --> 19:20.580
to make a good stack of money
here while the getting is good.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.711
But for things to run smooth,

19:22.870 --> 19:25.293
you got to grease the tracks.

19:25.456 --> 19:27.879
Yeah, I hear what
you're saying, Jimmy, and...

19:29.960 --> 19:32.930
...we go back a long way, so I'm not
gonna make a big deal out of this,

19:33.255 --> 19:34.507
but, uh...

19:36.550 --> 19:38.097
...I'm a Bondurant.

19:40.471 --> 19:43.145
And we don't lay down for nobody.

19:43.307 --> 19:46.902
<i>We'll continue to operate
free and clear here, as always.</i>

19:47.228 --> 19:50.858
Me, I'll never pay no money
to no Mason Wardell

19:51.023 --> 19:53.367
or the next damn bloodsucker
come after him.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.904
I never have, I never will.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.749
I'm sorry you feel that way,
Forrest.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.878
Jimmy, do you have something
that you really wanna say to me?

20:04.203 --> 20:06.626
You can't do it
the old way no more.

20:06.789 --> 20:08.757
I remember there was a time
you had some balls, Jimmy.

20:14.714 --> 20:18.014
Well, I guess we'll see what happens.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.427
Gentlemen.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.647
Look, Deputy, we've got
something of a problem here.

20:30.813 --> 20:34.363
It's Special Deputy, and
I don't see a problem at all.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.737
I hear these mountain boys
have got, uh...

20:37.903 --> 20:39.951
...injun blood in them.

20:40.114 --> 20:43.914
Cherokee. This would explain
why they're a little...

20:44.076 --> 20:46.579
...animalistic in their nature.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.965
I don't rightly understand
what you mean.

20:49.290 --> 20:53.215
But there's a feeling around
these parts that Forrest Bondurant

20:53.377 --> 20:55.471
is different than other folks.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.966
- Different?
- Indestructible.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.805
Do you mean "immortal"?

21:08.392 --> 21:12.397
Shit. You fucking hicks are
a sideshow unto yourselves.

21:18.694 --> 21:19.911
Sheriff, you have any idea

21:20.070 --> 21:22.368
what a Thompson submachine gun
does to "immortal"?

21:22.531 --> 21:26.502
Well, this ain't Chicago.
You can't just shoot him.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.504
Do that, people around here
will string us up from a tree.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.881
Do I look stupid to you?

21:35.795 --> 21:38.799
I've been brought in to do a job.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.592
And I know just who to start with.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.138
You know something?

21:47.598 --> 21:49.396
I don't much like you.

21:51.185 --> 21:53.483
Yeah, well, not many do.

22:09.745 --> 22:13.170
- Gimme some of that.
- Yeah, it's good.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.094
I could run them blockades.

22:23.259 --> 22:27.014
- You? A blockader? Shit.
- What do you mean "shit"?

22:27.179 --> 22:30.524
Danny, I can drive a damn sight
better than you can.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.651
Just not in the shitcan we got.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.780
Oh, yeah? Well, Forrest,
he don't wanna hear about it.

22:35.938 --> 22:39.613
Yeah, well...
the hell with Forrest.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.028
I'm sick of being his house dog.

22:46.323 --> 22:49.497
You gonna tell him that?
Or you want me to do that, too?

22:55.165 --> 22:56.132
You all right there, Jack?

22:56.292 --> 22:57.885
Shut up, Howard.

22:58.043 --> 22:59.920
Forrest ain't got no aspirations.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.966
He still sleeps on a mattress on the floor
like a fucking Chinaman.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.807
You might wanna watch your mouth there,
little brother.

23:07.970 --> 23:10.473
- Fuck off, Howard.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.104
- Oh, come on.
- Stop. Stop.

23:13.434 --> 23:14.686
It's...

23:17.897 --> 23:20.150
Where are you going with that stuff?

23:20.482 --> 23:21.984
Church.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.620
Hell, you better take
it easy on that jar then!

24:15.996 --> 24:20.547
<i>♪ He gave a peace</i>

24:20.709 --> 24:25.385
<i>♪ Of the world ♪</i>

24:29.593 --> 24:31.061
Let us pray.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.683
If any man loved the world,

24:35.849 --> 24:38.477
the love of the Father
is not in him.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.031
For all that is in the world,

24:42.189 --> 24:46.990
the lust of the flesh
and the lust of the eyes

24:47.152 --> 24:49.154
and the pride of life

24:49.321 --> 24:52.746
is not of the Father,
but is of the world.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.127
Amen.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.210
Thirty-nine, top.

26:38.847 --> 26:41.225
Too much rust
in the tank, maybe.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.532
- Or lead.

27:01.370 --> 27:02.587
Mind if I come in?

27:04.873 --> 27:08.252
Don't expect no biscuits
coming out around here.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.302
- Who's that?
- Aunt Winnie.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.726
Why don't you tell Aunt Winnie
this is not a social visit.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.728
Well, I ain't sure
that'll do no good, sir.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.106
She ain't right in the head.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.863
Three things you gotta tell us, son.

27:29.022 --> 27:32.071
Where's the still, where's the
liquor and where's the money?

27:38.866 --> 27:40.618
He don't have it.

27:43.537 --> 27:45.289
Now who might you be?

27:45.455 --> 27:47.173
That there is Jack Bondurant.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.337
Well, I'll be damned.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.723
I was told I'd find you here.

27:56.049 --> 27:57.392
And look...

28:00.846 --> 28:01.972
...here you are.

28:04.266 --> 28:06.268
Go find the still,
leave us alone.

28:14.693 --> 28:18.448
So, the runt of the litter.

28:18.614 --> 28:22.960
- You boys don't get it, do you?

28:23.118 --> 28:24.870
Look at me, son.

28:31.293 --> 28:33.466
Oh, you're a peach.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.305
What's going on?

28:45.432 --> 28:46.558
Come closer.

28:48.185 --> 28:49.812
Step forward.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.534
Stop right there.

29:12.793 --> 29:15.012
- Get up.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.268
I thought they said you
Bondurant boys were

29:21.426 --> 29:23.303
a bunch of hard-boiled
sons of bitches.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.856
Oh, this is terrible.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.198
This just won't do.

29:51.707 --> 29:53.755
My brothers are gonna get you.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.590
They're gonna kill you.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.379
Is that so?

29:57.546 --> 29:59.719
- It's not gonna help right now, is it?

30:06.263 --> 30:08.561
Why don't you tell
those brothers of yours

30:08.890 --> 30:10.892
we're coming for them next.

30:15.105 --> 30:17.107
You tell 'em.

30:17.274 --> 30:19.072
No more!

30:19.234 --> 30:22.283
No more, please.
Please.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.242
Don't touch me!

30:36.335 --> 30:38.508
Next time I come down real hard.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.190
All right.

31:35.519 --> 31:37.988
So you want to
get into this racket.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.988
But I see you sitting there,

31:42.150 --> 31:44.027
looking like somebody's
punching bag.

31:47.155 --> 31:48.748
Sol ask you...

31:50.659 --> 31:52.707
...what do you
intend to do now?

31:55.038 --> 31:57.757
- What do I intend to do?
- Yeah.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.090
You.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.924
You expect somebody else
to handle it?

32:06.091 --> 32:07.593
- No.
- Howard, maybe?

32:07.759 --> 32:09.682
- That ain't what I meant.
- What did you mean?

32:10.595 --> 32:11.847
I don't need no help.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.057
I'm sorry?

32:15.517 --> 32:18.111
- I don't need no help.
- Oh, you don't?

32:22.107 --> 32:23.404
Here it is.

32:25.193 --> 32:28.072
As long as you are my brother,

32:28.238 --> 32:30.616
you will never let this happen
again, do you understand?

32:30.949 --> 32:32.872
- I get it.
- I don't think you do.

32:36.413 --> 32:37.960
What if I can't?

32:40.709 --> 32:42.711
I mean, I ain't... I'm not
built like you and Howard.

32:43.044 --> 32:44.717
I ain't never been like you.

32:46.256 --> 32:47.473
It's all right.

32:52.471 --> 32:53.688
Jack...

32:56.391 --> 33:00.396
...it is not the violence
that sets a man apart.

33:00.562 --> 33:04.237
All right? It is the distance
that he is prepared to go.

33:07.068 --> 33:09.446
Jack, look at me.

33:09.613 --> 33:11.741
We're survivors.

33:11.907 --> 33:13.909
We control the fear.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.749
And without the fear,

33:16.912 --> 33:19.586
we are all as good as dead.

33:23.919 --> 33:26.388
Do you understand?

33:26.546 --> 33:28.093
- Do you?
- Rakes told me to tell you

33:28.256 --> 33:30.099
they're coming for you next.

33:30.842 --> 33:31.843
Hm.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.765
Yeah, well, they'll be back,
you can be sure of that.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.737
Um...

33:47.442 --> 33:49.536
A present from
your preacher friend.

33:53.782 --> 33:55.250
You gonna open it?

34:08.505 --> 34:09.882
Fuck you, Howard.

34:14.094 --> 34:15.641
Ah, damn.

34:55.552 --> 34:57.179
Forrest Bondurant.

34:57.345 --> 35:01.521
It seems you've been involved
in certain illegal activities.

35:02.684 --> 35:04.903
Illegal activities?

35:06.855 --> 35:09.859
Look here, Forrest,
if you play ball with us,

35:10.025 --> 35:13.029
we can make this here
summons disappear.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.032
Are you trying
to shake me down, Henry?

35:19.909 --> 35:21.786
I'm just the messenger here,
Forrest.

35:26.958 --> 35:27.925
Have you met Howard?

35:29.419 --> 35:31.513
Oh, what?
You gonna shoot me, huh?

35:31.671 --> 35:33.844
Howard! Howard!

35:34.174 --> 35:36.176
Huh? Huh?

35:38.386 --> 35:41.856
Huh? You gonna
hurt my brother?!

35:42.182 --> 35:46.153
Huh? You trying to intimidate
us, Sheriff? Huh?

35:47.687 --> 35:49.280
The Bondurants?

35:52.275 --> 35:54.243
All right now.
That's enough now.

35:54.402 --> 35:57.406
You gonna sell out
like them other Cocksuckers?

35:57.572 --> 36:00.416
- Huh?

36:00.575 --> 36:01.667
That's enough now.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.669
Howard, that's enough.

36:07.582 --> 36:10.085
- All right.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.930
You old piece of shit.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.558
Now, y'all oughta know better
than to come around here

36:16.716 --> 36:19.560
when Howard's been on the
stump whiskey for a few days.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.514
I think you might wanna
get out of here.

36:24.057 --> 36:27.527
You give my regards

36:27.686 --> 36:30.485
- to Special Deputy Rakes.
- Oh, yeah.

36:38.530 --> 36:41.158
It ain't nothing personal, Henry.

36:48.456 --> 36:50.379
He got that
special look in his eye.

36:50.542 --> 36:51.509
No I don't.

36:51.668 --> 36:52.920
- Yes, he does.
- Yes, you do.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.317
I saw you
at the Bondurant place.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.498
You're not from around here.

37:24.868 --> 37:26.370
Chicago, right?

37:30.957 --> 37:32.880
You were a dancer up there.

37:33.042 --> 37:35.545
The Apex Club, wasn't it?

37:35.712 --> 37:38.261
Did a little number
with feathers, I believe.

37:43.052 --> 37:44.679
Something troubling you?

37:44.846 --> 37:46.848
Get out of my way.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.518
Oh, you don't
need to worry about me.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.403
I ain't the kind to
drink from a greasy cup.

37:58.193 --> 37:59.661
Where's Jack?

38:00.528 --> 38:03.031
I've seen him swanning
around in Daddy's old suit.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.409
- Listen, Howard.
- Yeah?

38:06.576 --> 38:09.045
I need you here
with me tonight...

38:09.370 --> 38:11.043
I got some business with
a couple out-of-towners

38:11.372 --> 38:12.544
I never dealt with before.

38:12.707 --> 38:15.256
- Yeah? Where they from?
- Chicago.

38:17.796 --> 38:20.640
Yeah, well, me and Danny, we just
gotta stop by the stills first.

38:20.799 --> 38:23.552
You just be here by 11:00 now.
You got that?

38:23.718 --> 38:27.268
I got it.
When have I ever let you down?

38:54.999 --> 38:57.422
How'd you like to come
for a ride with me sometime?

38:57.585 --> 38:59.087
You must be jingle-brained
if you think I'm gonna

38:59.420 --> 39:02.048
get in a car
with the likes of you.

39:02.215 --> 39:05.094
Anyway, you oughta be worried
if my father catches you here.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.019
Talking to me.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.272
He's just in the feed store, there.

39:10.765 --> 39:13.109
Why'd I need to be worried?

39:13.434 --> 39:15.983
You know, coming to
the church meeting like that.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.819
And bustin' out of there
like a crazy person.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.033
Are you affected in the head?

39:22.443 --> 39:24.946
Hold on, now, look here.
Look.

39:25.113 --> 39:28.162
Crazy person wear a suit
as fancy as this?

39:28.324 --> 39:31.043
Still don't explain why
you acted like a lunatic.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.622
I didn't want
my feet washed, is all.

39:35.623 --> 39:38.376
- I know who you are.
- Yeah? Who's that?

39:38.543 --> 39:42.844
One of them Bondurant boys,
and that's enough.

39:43.006 --> 39:46.010
There ain't many that have
a good word to say about you.

39:46.175 --> 39:49.019
- Yeah?
- Except some rubbish about a legend.

39:49.178 --> 39:51.055
Yeah.

39:51.222 --> 39:54.476
About you guys being invincible
or some such nonsense.

39:54.642 --> 39:58.146
- Say that word again. What'd you say?
- Invincible.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.152
Well, shoot, I don't know
what that means.

40:00.481 --> 40:03.155
Sounds good, though.

40:03.318 --> 40:07.164
My daddy thinks you boys are
the worst thing ever to hit Franklin.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.324
Well, what would your daddy know?

40:10.909 --> 40:14.584
You sure got a funny way of courting,
Jack Bondurant.

40:14.746 --> 40:18.000
That is what you're doing, right?
Courting?

40:19.584 --> 40:20.676
Yeah.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.765
All right, then.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.890
You tell your daddy I said hi.

40:32.472 --> 40:34.850
- Oh sh...
- Thank you.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.708
- Oh!
- Woo!

40:58.539 --> 41:00.667
- Oh, shit!

41:18.726 --> 41:19.898
Hey, Red.

41:20.061 --> 41:21.654
Where them feathers at?

41:33.908 --> 41:35.660
He's a crip.
Don't worry about it.

41:35.827 --> 41:36.953
Hey, Forrest.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.587
All right, go tell Maggie
to shut her down.

41:50.800 --> 41:53.770
All right now, that's enough.
Come on, now, get out of here.

41:57.223 --> 42:01.273
I paid for another jar
and she won't give it.

42:01.436 --> 42:05.282
- And then the bitch done me.
- No, you didn't.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.818
We gonna buy near 100 gallons
of your liquor.

42:07.984 --> 42:10.203
Now you ain't gonna
throw in some extra?

42:10.528 --> 42:12.280
You ain't buying a goddamn thing.
Now go on, get out of here.

42:12.613 --> 42:15.662
He pulled a gun on her, then she
pulled the knife around and cut him.

42:19.412 --> 42:21.130
Did you pull a gun on this woman?

42:24.042 --> 42:25.339
Forrest!

42:32.633 --> 42:34.135
I may be a cripple boy,
you sack of shit

42:34.302 --> 42:36.976
but I'll blow your goddamn
brains out if you move!

42:46.689 --> 42:49.363
All right now. Sorry.

42:55.073 --> 42:56.074
Yeah.

43:26.145 --> 43:28.147
Goddamn you, Howard.

43:49.961 --> 43:51.929
Well, you best be getting home.

43:53.381 --> 43:55.224
- OK.

44:07.562 --> 44:09.564
Are you sure you're all right?

44:17.738 --> 44:21.083
A bit too much whoopee
for one night, I guess.

44:22.577 --> 44:23.578
Yeah.

44:30.585 --> 44:32.587
Bye, Forrest.

45:24.597 --> 45:29.478
Hm. Well that don't
make no sense.

45:33.856 --> 45:36.075
Well, I don't see nothin'...

45:42.156 --> 45:44.579
- Now you got trouble.

45:55.836 --> 45:57.838
Fuckin' hillbilly.

46:48.347 --> 46:49.724
Damn.

47:27.636 --> 47:29.138
Forrest?

47:42.276 --> 47:43.448
Forrest?

47:46.989 --> 47:48.332
Forrest?

47:52.286 --> 47:54.163
There's something
you need to know.

48:01.253 --> 48:02.971
Mm, now we're
gonna have some fun.

48:45.840 --> 48:47.262
You can come in.

48:47.425 --> 48:49.018
But don't let him talk.

49:00.104 --> 49:01.401
Hey, Forrest.

49:04.024 --> 49:05.947
Them doctors are saying
you walked in here.

49:08.279 --> 49:10.702
All the ways
from Blackwater Station.

49:10.865 --> 49:13.789
Through the damn snow.

49:19.540 --> 49:21.338
Did you get 'em, Forrest?

49:24.253 --> 49:26.506
'Cause I want to be there when you do.

49:26.714 --> 49:28.307
I'll hold them down myself.

49:30.593 --> 49:31.719
Walking all the way here from

49:32.052 --> 49:34.976
- Blackwater Station...
- Jack, why don't you shut up a minute?

49:50.654 --> 49:51.906
Um...

49:56.911 --> 49:59.255
You should've been there, Howard.

50:38.327 --> 50:40.329
Look what they did to you.

50:50.297 --> 50:52.470
I'm leaving, Forrest.

50:54.635 --> 50:55.636
Huh.

50:57.680 --> 51:01.184
Well, it ain't really the quiet
life you're looking for?

51:01.350 --> 51:03.569
Those people, Forrest...

51:06.814 --> 51:11.320
People like them,
they're why I left Chicago.

51:13.654 --> 51:15.827
I got out and ran.

51:21.078 --> 51:22.580
Come here, Maggie.

51:31.672 --> 51:34.926
Now this has nothing
to do with you, you hear?

51:36.885 --> 51:38.432
Nothing at all.

51:39.847 --> 51:42.350
Did you check out
of that place yet?

51:44.685 --> 51:48.531
I want you to come stay
at the station for a while.

51:50.608 --> 51:54.283
With those guys still around,
you're best off close to us.

51:57.031 --> 51:59.580
We don't want to
see you getting hurt.

52:01.285 --> 52:02.787
"We?"

52:03.787 --> 52:05.209
You can, uh...

52:07.666 --> 52:09.885
You can use the spare room.

52:26.393 --> 52:28.395
I know a fella across the county line,
take your whole run

52:28.562 --> 52:29.814
for five dollars on the gallon.

52:30.147 --> 52:31.490
- Baloney.
- No, Howard, it's a fact.

52:31.649 --> 52:33.322
- Cricket got a message to him.
- Five dollars?

52:33.484 --> 52:34.827
- Yep.
- Beat it, Jack.

52:34.985 --> 52:37.408
I'm not in the mind
for your horseshit.

52:37.571 --> 52:40.120
I'll do the driving, Howard,
you ain't gotta worry about nothing.

52:40.282 --> 52:41.750
You?

52:41.909 --> 52:43.582
- And Cricket.
- And Cricket,

52:43.744 --> 52:46.167
that twisted little gimp. You're
gonna deal with Floyd Banner?

52:46.330 --> 52:48.958
You're a goddamn house dog, Jack.
You sweep the floors.

52:49.124 --> 52:50.797
You got no goddamn vision, Howard.

52:50.959 --> 52:52.586
Go on, scram, get outta here.

52:55.172 --> 52:56.970
Hey what's eatin' you anyway, huh?

52:57.132 --> 52:58.975
The fact that you let your own brother,
old Forrest, down?

52:59.134 --> 53:00.932
Shut your mouth!

53:37.965 --> 53:39.638
What you doin', Jack?

53:41.135 --> 53:43.308
Checkin' on you.

53:43.470 --> 53:46.815
- I'm all right.
- All right, then.

53:46.974 --> 53:48.976
Yeah, I'm all right.

53:49.143 --> 53:52.067
- Yeah, I was just worried.
- I'll be home tomorrow.

53:53.981 --> 53:55.198
Go on, now.

53:56.817 --> 53:57.864
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

54:01.697 --> 54:03.745
- Hey.
- What the hell are you doin', Jack?

54:03.907 --> 54:04.999
Come here and help me with this.

54:05.159 --> 54:07.207
Shit, Jack, are you off your nuts?

54:07.369 --> 54:09.747
- I'm done waiting for table scraps.
- Forrest is gonna throttle you.

54:09.913 --> 54:12.007
Don't you worry about that, grab a box.

54:12.166 --> 54:13.668
You just call Gummy Walsh.

54:13.834 --> 54:15.757
You tell him we're
bringing a big load.

54:15.919 --> 54:17.671
Two hundred gallons at least.

54:17.838 --> 54:19.932
- "We?"
- Yeah.

54:21.008 --> 54:22.555
You mean you and me?

54:22.718 --> 54:26.188
Well, hell, I need backup, Cricket.
You my partner or what?

54:27.347 --> 54:28.018
Shit.

54:28.348 --> 54:29.725
Grab that tarp.

54:31.518 --> 54:32.519
Shit.

54:42.696 --> 54:46.371
Jesus, Cricket, you look like you're
about to shit yourself a kitten.

54:46.533 --> 54:47.955
Whoa, you wouldn't really
shoot that thing.

54:48.285 --> 54:49.753
If anybody gonna
give me cause to, I might.

54:49.912 --> 54:51.038
- Oh, bullshit, I don't believe you.
- Absolutely.

54:51.205 --> 54:53.628
Pow, right between the eyes.

55:01.423 --> 55:02.595
What is that?

55:04.218 --> 55:05.060
The transmission?

55:05.385 --> 55:07.934
It don't sound like it.

55:08.096 --> 55:09.769
Did you put gas in it?

55:13.477 --> 55:15.900
- Did you put gas in the truck?
- Shit!

55:16.063 --> 55:18.907
You forgot to put gas in it. Well,
what the fuck are we gonna do now?

55:19.066 --> 55:19.908
Uh...

55:20.067 --> 55:21.410
- Huh?
- Uh...

55:23.946 --> 55:26.290
I'm sorry, Jack!
I had other things on my mind.

55:26.448 --> 55:28.416
Like robbing your brothers,
for instance.

55:28.575 --> 55:30.919
Other things on your mind? All you
had to do was put gas in the truck!

55:31.078 --> 55:32.421
All you had to do
was put gas in it!

55:32.579 --> 55:35.048
I got me an idea.
I got an idea.

55:35.249 --> 55:37.092
Now we're just two bootleggers
waiting for the ATU!

55:37.251 --> 55:40.346
This road is crawling
with cops, Cricket!

55:40.504 --> 55:42.506
You know that we're
just sitting ducks?

55:43.757 --> 55:46.385
- You gotta be kidding me!
- What, you got a better idea?

55:48.595 --> 55:51.098
You're gonna put moonshine
in the gas tank?

55:54.768 --> 55:56.020
Come on!

56:07.698 --> 56:09.996
- Oh, shit!

56:10.158 --> 56:12.411
Yeah! Yeah!

57:11.053 --> 57:13.181
You must be Cricket Pate, huh?

57:14.389 --> 57:17.108
Jack, meet Gummy Walsh.

57:20.812 --> 57:22.189
So what you got?

57:22.522 --> 57:25.446
Well, sir, we got 100 gallons
of quality White Lightning,

57:25.609 --> 57:27.202
and 100 finest Crazy Apple.

57:27.527 --> 57:30.872
- Eel juice from Franklin County?
- Yes, sir.

57:33.033 --> 57:34.034
All right.

57:35.243 --> 57:36.586
It's all right.

57:40.916 --> 57:42.418
What you got there,
a little pea-shooter?

57:47.923 --> 57:50.221
OK, now walk.

57:50.384 --> 57:52.887
- Walk.
- We had a deal.

57:53.053 --> 57:55.897
You're one stupid sack of shit,
ain't you, boy?

57:56.056 --> 57:57.899
Can't we work something out?

58:01.061 --> 58:03.655
That how you hillbillies do business?
With a pop-gun?

58:03.814 --> 58:05.737
I said fucking walk!

58:23.083 --> 58:24.505
That's far enough.

58:32.634 --> 58:35.012
All right, you're next.

58:38.473 --> 58:41.022
You dug them boys
a hole like I told you?

58:43.937 --> 58:45.484
Meet Floyd Banner.

58:53.238 --> 58:56.037
Ain't no honor in the business any more.

58:56.199 --> 58:58.998
- Shoot 'em.
- Wait, wait.

58:59.161 --> 59:02.290
Best stand back, fellas, unless
you wanna get your suits all splattered.

59:02.572 --> 59:04.745
These country boys
can make a real mess.

59:04.907 --> 59:06.830
Wait, wait, wait!
My name's Jack Bondurant.

59:06.993 --> 59:09.087
I come from Blackwater Station.

59:30.349 --> 59:31.942
That's impressive.

59:36.606 --> 59:39.780
I'll give you four dollars,
but keep it to yourself.

59:39.942 --> 59:43.037
Those boys out front,
they only get but three and a half.

59:45.031 --> 59:46.499
I was told five.

59:57.335 --> 59:59.178
Let's get it unloaded.

01:00:05.551 --> 01:00:07.224
I respect you Bondurants
standing up to

01:00:07.386 --> 01:00:10.139
that Commonwealth's District Attorney.

01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:12.274
He's got everybody in his pocket.

01:00:12.433 --> 01:00:15.858
He takes a shit and
half of Virginia falls out his ass.

01:00:24.237 --> 01:00:25.989
There's something you ought to know.

01:00:28.699 --> 01:00:31.327
I heard what happened
to your brother, Forrest.

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:34.873
Them cocksuckers that
did it used to work for me.

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:41.262
- They work for you?
- They left my outfit.

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:45.926
Got an offer from some
slick-looking deputy. He wore perfume.

01:00:46.092 --> 01:00:47.184
Charlie Rakes?

01:00:49.428 --> 01:00:51.772
Yeah, that was him.

01:00:51.931 --> 01:00:54.184
What happened to Forrest...

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:56.102
...had nothing to do with me.

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:59.572
Make sure you tell Forrest that.

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:02.525
Tell him Floyd Banner says hello.

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:08.202
Give him this.

01:01:11.033 --> 01:01:12.376
Say it's a gift

01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:15.755
from the Midnight Coal Company.

01:01:23.045 --> 01:01:27.391
Yeah. Now I remember
them Bondurant boys.

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.551
That boy's brother,

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:33.144
he's the one who walked
20 miles with his head out clear off.

01:01:33.306 --> 01:01:36.560
They say he goes around drinking
white mule through a hole in his throat.

01:01:39.979 --> 01:01:44.485
<i>I got every lawman in three
fucking states up my ass!</i>

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:46.903
The last thing I need
is some hard-ass crackers

01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:50.073
pulling a damn blood feud on me!

01:01:50.239 --> 01:01:52.913
Now get this sack of shit out of here!

01:02:16.098 --> 01:02:19.648
You're gonna hold on, Forrest.
You gotta hear me out.

01:02:19.810 --> 01:02:22.154
I sold your whole lot
to Floyd Banner in one damn go.

01:02:22.313 --> 01:02:24.566
Would have taken you a month
to off-load that.

01:02:24.899 --> 01:02:27.118
Not only that, I sold it
for five dollars on the barrel.

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:29.699
That's twice what you get.
Right here?

01:02:32.323 --> 01:02:35.793
That's two thousand dollars,
minus my commission.

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:48.802
Look at you.

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:52.468
You think you're
so goddamn smart.

01:02:54.387 --> 01:02:57.357
You're swanning around
like you're Al Capone.

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:00.522
With your new best friend.

01:03:00.726 --> 01:03:04.947
You take a good look, Jack.

01:03:05.898 --> 01:03:07.024
That's your new best friend.

01:03:07.191 --> 01:03:08.659
Yeah, you're wrong there, too.

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.993
Special Deputy Rakes was the one
hired the men to do that to you.

01:03:13.155 --> 01:03:15.203
- Who told you that?
- Floyd Banner himself.

01:03:15.366 --> 01:03:17.869
Oh, Floyd Banner himself.

01:03:19.495 --> 01:03:21.668
Well, that must be gospel.
What's that?

01:03:21.997 --> 01:03:24.591
It's a gift.
From Floyd Banner.

01:03:24.917 --> 01:03:27.170
It's an address, Forrest.

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.555
For where you can find them
bastards who cut your throat.

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.763
I say we get 'em tonight.

01:03:40.057 --> 01:03:42.606
Anything else I can
do for you, Forrest?

01:03:42.768 --> 01:03:45.191
Sweep your fuckin' floors, maybe?

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:51.702
I got somewhere I gotta be.

01:04:12.131 --> 01:04:13.132
Can I come in?

01:04:16.135 --> 01:04:18.058
- Better be quick then.
- I'll be quick.

01:04:20.556 --> 01:04:22.103
Got me one of them cameras.

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:26.146
- Stand right here.
- Here?

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:34.404
Lord, if my daddy caught me with one
of those things, he'd murder me.

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:36.447
You gotta keep steady now,
so as I can get it.

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:39.249
- All right.

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:40.751
Why'd you stop fooling around?

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:42.753
That's how the movie stars
do it in California.

01:04:43.078 --> 01:04:44.421
All right.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.459
One, two, three.

01:04:50.336 --> 01:04:52.430
- Now you.
- All right.

01:04:53.964 --> 01:04:54.965
Ready?

01:05:00.262 --> 01:05:01.684
How'd I look?

01:05:01.847 --> 01:05:03.645
Like trouble, Jack Bondurant.

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.869
I got me a new car.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.532
Forrest?

01:05:21.617 --> 01:05:22.618
Hey.

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:27.047
Huh?

01:05:27.206 --> 01:05:28.583
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Yeah.

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:29.792
Where's Forrest?

01:05:31.210 --> 01:05:32.553
- What?
- Jack.

01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:34.133
- Have they gone without me?
- You don't have to be like...

01:05:34.296 --> 01:05:36.424
Shit. I found out where they was.

01:06:24.555 --> 01:06:27.024
You know how they say
you ain't got no balls, Jack?

01:06:33.188 --> 01:06:35.190
They was wrong.

01:06:36.358 --> 01:06:38.235
You send these to Rakes.

01:06:47.119 --> 01:06:49.713
You're looking real sharp there, kid.

01:06:55.127 --> 01:06:57.380
The trumpet has been blown,

01:06:57.546 --> 01:07:01.676
the battlement stormed,
and the walls have come tumbling down.

01:07:20.736 --> 01:07:21.953
Who's there?

01:08:32.433 --> 01:08:34.982
<i>I kept hearing the country
was in a real bad way.</i>

01:08:37.979 --> 01:08:40.323
<i>Folks outta work, people dusted out,</i>

01:08:40.482 --> 01:08:42.904
<i>losing their homes and
their farms and all.</i>

01:08:43.234 --> 01:08:44.987
<i>But from my perspective,</i>

01:08:45.319 --> 01:08:48.995
<i>the situation was something
different entirely.</i>

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:52.002
<i>Once we started shifting that
liquor across the county line,</i>

01:08:52.327 --> 01:08:54.421
<i>that money just started
pouring in.</i>

01:08:55.205 --> 01:08:57.207
<i>That don't mean the runs were easy.</i>

01:08:57.374 --> 01:08:59.216
<i>Rakes was coming at us day and night.</i>

01:09:03.881 --> 01:09:06.009
Go on, boy, gimme a reason.

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:07.763
Y'all get the fuck out of Franklin.

01:09:17.185 --> 01:09:19.439
<i>Then Cricket,
he had one of his ideas.</i>

01:09:19.604 --> 01:09:22.358
<i>He stuck a souped-up
carburetor in that Ford.</i>

01:09:22.524 --> 01:09:24.276
<i>It was thing of pure beauty.</i>

01:09:24.443 --> 01:09:26.366
<i>He's gifted, that boy.</i>

01:09:26.528 --> 01:09:30.249
<i>Me, well, ain't no one could say
I couldn't drive a damn car.</i>

01:09:47.841 --> 01:09:50.765
- Forrest, dance with me!
- I ain't dancing to this.

01:09:50.928 --> 01:09:53.680
- Come on...

01:10:06.568 --> 01:10:07.911
<i>Meanwhile,
Howard and me hammered out</i>

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:10.789
<i>four 300 gallon submarine stills.</i>

01:10:12.074 --> 01:10:14.748
<i>They were the biggest stills
Franklin had ever seen</i>

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:17.789
<i>and we hid them deep in the woods
where Rakes could never find them.</i>

01:10:19.248 --> 01:10:21.797
Come on, you gotta look tough, Cricket.

01:10:33.679 --> 01:10:34.931
Get off my property, boy!

01:10:35.097 --> 01:10:36.440
I catch you near my daughter again,

01:10:36.598 --> 01:10:38.475
God Himself won't
be able to help you!

01:10:38.642 --> 01:10:41.942
- You hear me?!
- One, two, three.

01:10:53.991 --> 01:10:56.710
<i>By that time,
Jimmy and them others caved in,</i>

01:10:56.869 --> 01:10:58.621
<i>made deals with Wardell.</i>

01:10:59.663 --> 01:11:01.631
<i>All except our cousin, Spoons.</i>

01:11:06.003 --> 01:11:08.347
<i>But Rakes took him
out of the picture altogether.</i>

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:18.228
<i>We Bondurants,
we were the last ones standing.</i>

01:13:17.843 --> 01:13:19.937
You just gonna watch me forever?

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:27.440
Um...

01:13:29.104 --> 01:13:31.607
Uh... What...
What you doin'?

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.249
Damned if you don't
keep a girl waiting.

01:14:33.668 --> 01:14:35.341
Forrest?

01:15:16.878 --> 01:15:19.757
Now hold on, Bertha, before you
start talking about your soul,

01:15:19.923 --> 01:15:23.052
vanity and all that sort of stuff, I wanna
make sure you understand something.

01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:25.937
This here vehicle,
you know what that is?

01:15:26.096 --> 01:15:28.315
That's a Rumbleseat Roadster.
It's a Ford V8.

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.392
Not many in the world get a
chance to drive in such a thing.

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:32.732
It's only fair of me to warn you
before you open that door

01:15:32.894 --> 01:15:34.896
and get inside, nothing's gonna
be the same as it was before.

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:36.815
Your whole life is
gonna change forever.

01:15:36.982 --> 01:15:38.905
Now you can sit there on that gate
and you can shake your head,

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:40.740
talking about "Daddy this" and
"Daddy that" till you're blue in the face

01:15:40.902 --> 01:15:43.906
or you can climb down off that gate,
you can live a little bit,

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:45.369
- you can get inside my car...
- Hey, Jack...

01:15:45.699 --> 01:15:46.996
Hold on, Bertha, this is the best part.

01:15:47.159 --> 01:15:48.411
- There's kudzu fields just up...
- Jack.

01:15:48.743 --> 01:15:50.245
Yeah?

01:15:50.412 --> 01:15:52.756
You still got the price tag
on your coat.

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:57.423
No, I don't.

01:15:58.587 --> 01:16:01.261
- Come here.
- Where?

01:16:17.647 --> 01:16:19.399
Jeepers, Jack.

01:16:19.566 --> 01:16:20.988
It sure goes fast.

01:16:21.151 --> 01:16:22.448
Fast?

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:29.660
Now we're going fast.

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:30.054
Don't you like it?

01:17:31.596 --> 01:17:34.349
It don't matter if I like it,
I can't wear this.

01:17:34.516 --> 01:17:37.395
I just wanted to
get you something nice.

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:41.360
Where do you think I'd be able
to wear something like that?

01:17:41.523 --> 01:17:44.572
I'll take you somewhere so you can
wear something like that every day.

01:17:48.029 --> 01:17:49.656
Why don't you try it on?

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:54.453
What? Here?

01:17:54.619 --> 01:17:56.963
- Yeah, ain't nobody around.
- You're around.

01:17:57.122 --> 01:18:00.376
I... I'll just... listen to my radio,
look out at this tree here.

01:18:00.542 --> 01:18:03.546
I won't look, you can go back
behind the car and put it on.

01:18:11.303 --> 01:18:14.477
All right, seeing as
you bought it and all.

01:18:29.946 --> 01:18:31.163
You better not look.

01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:40.423
- You better not be looking.
- I'm not looking.

01:18:40.582 --> 01:18:43.051
Just over here at this
woodpecker on a tree.

01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:58.141
Well?

01:18:59.934 --> 01:19:00.935
How do I look?

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:13.281
Come on.

01:19:51.861 --> 01:19:55.240
Oh, shit, Jack. Goddamn.

01:20:11.464 --> 01:20:13.341
I got you, you dumb hick.

01:20:24.769 --> 01:20:27.693
Watch your step, here.
Whatcha think?

01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:30.780
- What do I think about what?
- My place of employment.

01:20:33.945 --> 01:20:37.199
- Hey.
- Hot socks, Jack.

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:38.912
What's she doing here?

01:20:39.075 --> 01:20:43.171
Miss Bertha Minnix,
meet my partner, the Cricket Pate.

01:20:43.329 --> 01:20:45.502
Pleased to meet you, Cricket Pate.

01:20:47.459 --> 01:20:49.336
The pleasure's all mine, miss.

01:20:50.795 --> 01:20:53.389
Boy, oh, boy, Jack, your
brothers are gonna shit their grits.

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:54.720
Don't you worry about it.

01:20:56.634 --> 01:20:58.386
This is it.

01:20:58.553 --> 01:21:00.521
- It's a real hideout.
- Howard's up in the look-out.

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:03.524
It's the biggest distillation
set-up in these hills.

01:21:03.683 --> 01:21:05.230
We're able to put
out 1,000 gallons a week.

01:21:05.393 --> 01:21:06.690
No one around here comes
close to doing that.

01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:07.942
You're an outlaw, Jack.

01:21:08.104 --> 01:21:10.607
No, that's just a matter
of perspective.

01:21:10.773 --> 01:21:12.446
I'm just doing what
any man around here would do

01:21:12.609 --> 01:21:14.737
if he had the same
strength of character.

01:21:17.071 --> 01:21:19.290
You got it all figured out?

01:21:19.449 --> 01:21:20.917
Yeah.

01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:28.754
Damned if your face don't
belong on a coin, Bertha.

01:21:30.502 --> 01:21:33.130
- Jack.
- I mean it.

01:21:33.755 --> 01:21:37.259
<i>I ain't never seen nothing
as beautiful as you right here.</i>

01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:38.722
Not never.

01:21:38.885 --> 01:21:40.512
I wish I had the damn words to tell you.

01:21:40.678 --> 01:21:42.271
You're doing just fine.

01:22:07.872 --> 01:22:10.000
You're a damn fool, Jack.

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:22.354
- Jack!
- What?

01:22:22.512 --> 01:22:23.729
- It's the law!
- What?

01:22:24.055 --> 01:22:25.557
The law! The ATU!
It's the law!

01:22:25.723 --> 01:22:27.270
Come here, come here.

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:33.194
- What the hell was that?
- We gotta go!

01:22:34.148 --> 01:22:37.118
All right, look.
You take her. Take her.

01:22:37.277 --> 01:22:38.692
- Go to the Station, I'll meet you there.
- Jack...

01:22:38.736 --> 01:22:40.488
Go. Go, go, goddamn it, go!

01:22:48.246 --> 01:22:50.795
- Keep moving!
- Where the fuck is that coming from?

01:22:50.957 --> 01:22:53.426
- Mm...

01:22:56.170 --> 01:22:58.218
Go, go, go!

01:23:11.894 --> 01:23:14.317
- Do you think we scared them off?
- I don't know.

01:23:25.283 --> 01:23:27.126
- What the hell's that?

01:23:33.207 --> 01:23:35.881
- Goddamn it, listen!
- Shit.

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:50.267
Huh?

01:23:53.728 --> 01:23:56.231
Fuck!

01:24:02.362 --> 01:24:05.081
- I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker.
- Hey, Rakes!

01:24:09.952 --> 01:24:11.920
Remember me?

01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:22.307
- You're not gonna shoot me.
- Oh, yeah?

01:24:24.926 --> 01:24:27.600
Look at you. Boo-hoo.

01:24:28.179 --> 01:24:29.322
OK, let's go. Close in!

01:24:29.514 --> 01:24:32.358
- Goddamn nance.

01:24:32.517 --> 01:24:34.235
- Move in!
- Come on, Jack!

01:24:36.479 --> 01:24:38.231
Go, go, go!

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:47.411
Get those sons of bitches! Fuck!

01:24:58.042 --> 01:25:00.386
- Good job, boys.
- Thank you, sir.

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:04.640
They found Cricket Pate
and some gal.

01:25:04.799 --> 01:25:06.972
- The cripple boy?
- Yep.

01:25:07.301 --> 01:25:09.474
- Hiding out in the woods.
- You all right?

01:25:12.724 --> 01:25:14.852
Come on, miss,
let's get you home, now.

01:25:15.017 --> 01:25:16.143
Come on.

01:25:20.690 --> 01:25:21.782
Come on.

01:25:22.567 --> 01:25:24.615
Don't worry, miss, he'll be fine.

01:26:04.484 --> 01:26:05.781
Keep on going.

01:26:11.532 --> 01:26:14.786
That friend of yours,
he called me a nance.

01:26:14.952 --> 01:26:17.080
Why would he say that?

01:26:17.246 --> 01:26:19.419
I don't know, sir.

01:26:19.582 --> 01:26:22.005
Maybe 'cause you smell funny.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:30.802
What's wrong with
your damn legs, anyway?

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:36.646
I got rickets when I was a kid.

01:26:36.808 --> 01:26:38.731
Left me a little hinky.

01:26:44.398 --> 01:26:46.571
That's it. Down a bit.

01:26:50.696 --> 01:26:52.619
Here, just go in here.

01:26:56.410 --> 01:26:59.914
What are we...
Why do you want me to go in there?

01:27:00.081 --> 01:27:02.425
It's fine. Come on.

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:15.184
He makes a goddamn mess
on Charlie Rakes' shirt!

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:23.654
- He called me a fucking nance!

01:28:25.166 --> 01:28:27.885
Forrest, I never meant to...

01:28:30.171 --> 01:28:32.219
Go on, you never meant what?

01:28:35.092 --> 01:28:37.720
To walk around like you own the place?

01:28:39.263 --> 01:28:40.560
Or like you're...

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.193
...you're public enemy number one now?

01:28:44.352 --> 01:28:46.195
Forrest, I was just
trying to make sure...

01:28:50.024 --> 01:28:53.198
Letting you in was a mistake.

01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:55.034
- I'm sorry.
- Hm?

01:28:55.196 --> 01:28:57.119
I said I'm sorry. I'm sorry
they damn blew up your stills.

01:28:57.448 --> 01:28:59.200
I'm sorry they got the car.

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:01.961
- I'm sorry they took your money.
- My money?

01:29:02.119 --> 01:29:04.292
Hold on. My money?

01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:08.258
This ain't about the goddamn money.

01:29:08.417 --> 01:29:10.545
This is about a goddamn principle.

01:29:10.711 --> 01:29:12.213
Might be
he's had enough, Forrest.

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:13.677
Yeah, as for you,
you dumb son of a bitch...

01:29:13.839 --> 01:29:15.216
I just heard...

01:29:16.133 --> 01:29:17.430
They got Cricket.

01:29:22.098 --> 01:29:24.942
- What do you mean?
- They killed him.

01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:29.738
Cricket's dead, Jack.

01:29:52.753 --> 01:29:56.098
That boy never hurt a... fly.

01:30:05.349 --> 01:30:07.602
He was a good boy.

01:30:26.746 --> 01:30:29.340
Them bastards!

01:31:01.155 --> 01:31:02.202
Forrest.

01:31:04.784 --> 01:31:08.038
Uh, we just want to say how...

01:31:08.204 --> 01:31:10.332
How sorry we are about Cricket.

01:31:10.498 --> 01:31:12.250
We all liked that boy.

01:31:12.583 --> 01:31:15.883
And whatever was done to him goes
beyond the point of forgiveness.

01:31:17.630 --> 01:31:20.099
Yeah, well there's a lot
that can't be forgiven.

01:31:20.299 --> 01:31:22.893
All right, Forrest, I know
what we done wasn't right...

01:31:23.052 --> 01:31:25.020
You sold us out, Jimmy.

01:31:28.099 --> 01:31:30.101
It's time y'all picked a side.

01:32:04.718 --> 01:32:06.470
Jack.

01:33:03.485 --> 01:33:05.658
- What do you want?
- I need to talk to Forrest.

01:33:05.821 --> 01:33:07.789
- No you don't.
- Ja...

01:33:07.948 --> 01:33:09.541
You talk to me now.

01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:13.458
Now, looky here, Jack.

01:33:13.621 --> 01:33:16.966
I just want y'all to know
that neither me nor my officers

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:19.798
had anything to do with
what happened to Cricket.

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:21.883
- He was a good boy...
- Just your best buddy, Rakes.

01:33:22.046 --> 01:33:24.469
He ain't my buddy.

01:33:24.632 --> 01:33:26.509
What he done to that boy...

01:33:26.675 --> 01:33:28.177
...there can be no absolution.

01:33:28.344 --> 01:33:30.346
You come all the way out here
to tell me that?

01:33:30.512 --> 01:33:33.231
I'm risking something being here, Jack.

01:33:33.432 --> 01:33:37.107
Now... I come here to tell you
that what happened to Cricket

01:33:37.269 --> 01:33:41.149
ain't the end of something, but the start
of something. You understand me?

01:33:41.315 --> 01:33:43.317
Mason Wardell,
he's gotten Rakes to bring in

01:33:43.484 --> 01:33:45.828
extra ATU officers from the city.

01:33:45.986 --> 01:33:47.988
They're gonna shut down
the whole damn county.

01:33:48.155 --> 01:33:50.999
They already got me and
my deputies close down the bridge.

01:33:51.158 --> 01:33:52.876
No one's getting in
and no one's getting out.

01:33:53.035 --> 01:33:54.912
- Where is Rakes?
- Never you mind.

01:33:55.079 --> 01:33:57.332
- I asked you a question.
- I'm warning you, son.

01:33:57.498 --> 01:33:59.045
You keep your voice down.

01:34:00.876 --> 01:34:03.174
You better lay low.

01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:07.262
At least till this blows over.
This is a war they is waging.

01:34:07.424 --> 01:34:09.518
You ain't gonna survive.

01:34:13.389 --> 01:34:14.857
You best get out of here now.

01:34:18.978 --> 01:34:20.446
Go on.

01:34:49.466 --> 01:34:52.640
Jack!

01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:57.232
Forrest!

01:34:57.391 --> 01:34:59.940
- Ah, shit.
- Hey, wake up!

01:35:01.937 --> 01:35:03.735
Damn it, Jack.

01:35:07.609 --> 01:35:08.531
What are you doing?

01:35:08.861 --> 01:35:11.956
Well, Jack's gone off half-cocked.

01:35:12.114 --> 01:35:15.994
- That's it, then.

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:18.504
Forrest, Jack done took off
in Cricket's car!

01:35:18.829 --> 01:35:21.082
Calm down, Howard.
Go fetch the car.

01:35:21.248 --> 01:35:23.592
He got trouble
written all over him.

01:35:25.336 --> 01:35:26.929
Come on, Danny, I said get up!

01:35:27.087 --> 01:35:28.930
I gotta watch you die all over again.

01:35:29.089 --> 01:35:31.091
What you talkin' about?

01:35:32.092 --> 01:35:34.561
I gotta find you lying
in a pool of your own blood?

01:35:34.887 --> 01:35:37.515
Drag your damn body into my car?

01:35:39.433 --> 01:35:42.983
Drive you down to the hospital,
your throat cut from ear to ear?

01:35:48.609 --> 01:35:50.202
You did that?

01:35:52.488 --> 01:35:54.786
I'm not doing it again.

01:35:57.951 --> 01:35:59.373
I thought I walked.

01:36:00.662 --> 01:36:01.959
Isn't that just like you

01:36:02.122 --> 01:36:05.126
to believe your own damn legend?

01:36:06.794 --> 01:36:08.637
Come on, Forrest,
get a move on!

01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:11.549
Wait a minute.
You came back here that night?

01:36:17.304 --> 01:36:18.806
They see you?

01:36:22.684 --> 01:36:24.903
Forrest, come on!

01:36:25.062 --> 01:36:28.316
- Then what happened?
- Nothing.

01:36:31.485 --> 01:36:33.863
I asked you a question.

01:36:34.029 --> 01:36:35.372
I told you.

01:36:37.991 --> 01:36:40.039
Look at me.

01:36:49.253 --> 01:36:50.926
Maggie, look at me.

01:36:59.596 --> 01:37:03.021
- What happened when you got back?
- Not a damn thing.

01:37:05.185 --> 01:37:07.529
Now you know.

01:37:07.688 --> 01:37:10.612
Not a goddamn one of them bastards

01:37:10.941 --> 01:37:14.366
ever did a damn thing to me.

01:37:20.242 --> 01:37:21.789
Forrest, come on!

01:37:27.207 --> 01:37:29.801
- Son of a bitch.

01:38:18.759 --> 01:38:21.808
- Wasn't that Jack Bondurant?
- Shit!

01:38:35.108 --> 01:38:37.452
It's that Bondurant boy!

01:38:41.657 --> 01:38:43.659
Where's that murdering piece of shit?!

01:38:44.535 --> 01:38:45.832
He's got a gun.

01:38:45.994 --> 01:38:48.543
Rakes! You motherfucker,
where are you?!

01:38:48.705 --> 01:38:50.799
- Where are you?!
- Just hold it right there, Jack.

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:54.679
- Rakes, you bastard!
- You looking for me, son?

01:38:57.130 --> 01:38:58.803
Stop!

01:38:58.966 --> 01:39:00.593
Rakes!

01:39:00.759 --> 01:39:04.354
Deputy! Stand down, deputy!

01:39:04.513 --> 01:39:07.517
- You are one stupid boy!
- Put down your weapon.

01:39:15.899 --> 01:39:19.244
Forrest.

01:39:20.487 --> 01:39:21.488
Hey!

01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:28.753
Kill those sons of bitches!

01:40:05.407 --> 01:40:06.784
Hold your fire!

01:40:07.117 --> 01:40:08.869
Huh? How's that feel?

01:40:09.036 --> 01:40:11.209
Come on, Danny.

01:40:11.371 --> 01:40:15.126
Ceasefire!

01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:25.724
Cease fire, deputies!

01:40:25.886 --> 01:40:27.854
Take that, you shit-kicking rubes!

01:40:31.725 --> 01:40:32.817
Jack!

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:35.108
- Get him out of there!
- Howard!

01:40:38.231 --> 01:40:40.404
I'll teach you to mess with
Special Deputy Charlie Rakes.

01:40:40.567 --> 01:40:41.944
Sheriff?

01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:43.737
You are nothing now!

01:40:45.322 --> 01:40:47.575
That goes for all you hicks!

01:40:49.326 --> 01:40:51.829
Stand down, everybody!
Stand down!

01:40:52.162 --> 01:40:54.961
- Cease fire!

01:40:55.123 --> 01:40:57.421
Hold your fire. Jimmy, please.

01:40:58.293 --> 01:41:01.342
Let's stop this right here.
No one else needs to get hurt.

01:41:01.505 --> 01:41:04.258
Time to die, you chicken-shit
sons of bitches!

01:41:06.426 --> 01:41:07.427
Stand down, deputy!

01:41:07.594 --> 01:41:08.891
It's time for me
to take out the garbage!

01:41:09.054 --> 01:41:10.931
- Goddamn it, Rakes, stand down!
- Immortal?

01:41:11.264 --> 01:41:12.766
- Immortal?! What a fucking laugh!
- Deputy!

01:41:13.975 --> 01:41:15.977
Fuck!

01:41:20.774 --> 01:41:22.617
Someone help Forrest!

01:41:32.285 --> 01:41:34.959
Now get the fuck out of Franklin.

01:41:38.792 --> 01:41:39.964
You gonna let him walk away?

01:41:40.127 --> 01:41:42.630
Get out of my way! All of you!

01:41:42.796 --> 01:41:45.970
- Now, everybody...
- Fuck!

01:41:46.133 --> 01:41:48.636
- Just stay calm.
- Come on, just take it easy.

01:41:48.802 --> 01:41:50.554
I work for the Commonwealth's attorney!

01:41:50.721 --> 01:41:52.644
Stay where you are, Jimmy.

01:41:56.643 --> 01:41:57.940
You're candy-assed motherfuckers!

01:41:58.270 --> 01:42:00.489
- Every single one of you!

01:42:02.107 --> 01:42:03.450
- You bastard!

01:42:08.655 --> 01:42:12.000
- Forrest! Forrest!
- Goddamn it, stop shooting!

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:13.786
- Holster your weapons!
- No!

01:42:13.994 --> 01:42:16.838
Get some help!
Somebody get some help!

01:42:16.997 --> 01:42:17.998
What was he thinking?

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:20.668
You fucking bastards
are gonna pay for this!

01:42:22.544 --> 01:42:24.638
Rakes!

01:42:24.796 --> 01:42:28.517
Jack!
Now just hold it right there, Jack!

01:42:30.510 --> 01:42:31.853
Gimme the gun.

01:42:34.931 --> 01:42:38.561
Now, everybody just stay calm.

01:42:38.727 --> 01:42:40.525
Let it be, Jimmy.

01:42:43.106 --> 01:42:44.528
Jack.

01:42:44.691 --> 01:42:46.534
Jack!

01:42:46.693 --> 01:42:49.617
Fuck.

01:43:08.715 --> 01:43:10.388
Christ.

01:43:32.781 --> 01:43:34.954
Son of a bitch.

01:44:05.313 --> 01:44:06.940
All right then.

01:44:45.812 --> 01:44:49.658
<i>In December 1933,
Prohibition finished.</i>

01:44:53.111 --> 01:44:56.536
<i>So ended the great Franklin County
Moonshine Conspiracy,</i>

01:44:56.698 --> 01:44:58.166
<i>as it became known.</i>

01:45:00.994 --> 01:45:03.668
<i>That same year,
Commonwealth Attorney Mason Wardell</i>

01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:06.003
<i>was arrested on charges of corruption.</i>

01:45:17.928 --> 01:45:21.774
<i>A couple years later,
Howard moved to Martinville,</i>

01:45:21.932 --> 01:45:24.606
<i>found work in the textile mills there.</i>

01:45:24.768 --> 01:45:29.023
<i>Surprised us all by getting hitched,
having a whole bunch of children.</i>

01:45:31.858 --> 01:45:33.826
<i>Bertha Minnix,</i>

01:45:33.985 --> 01:45:37.114
<i>the preacher's daughter, well,</i>

01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:40.705
<i>that gal always had
a rebellious streak in her.</i>

01:45:40.867 --> 01:45:43.120
<i>We got married the following year.</i>

01:45:43.453 --> 01:45:46.753
<i>I ran my daddy's farm.
Raised cattle,</i>

01:45:46.915 --> 01:45:47.757
<i>grew tobacco.</i>

01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:50.547
All right, then, here we go.

01:45:50.710 --> 01:45:52.212
<i>After he got shot at the bridge,</i>

01:45:52.545 --> 01:45:56.595
<i>Forrest spent two weeks
recuperating in the hospital.</i>

01:45:56.758 --> 01:46:00.058
<i>Then he walked out of there
and married Maggie.</i>

01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:02.814
- You gonna toast, Howard?
- Yeah.

01:46:04.432 --> 01:46:06.810
<i>Neither of them told no one.</i>

01:46:06.977 --> 01:46:08.695
<i>I only found out years later.</i>

01:46:08.853 --> 01:46:10.696
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:46:10.855 --> 01:46:12.448
<i>He was like that, Forrest.</i>

01:46:15.735 --> 01:46:17.578
Don't you boys be making a commotion

01:46:17.737 --> 01:46:19.455
when you come upstairs, all right?

01:46:19.614 --> 01:46:20.615
- Yes, ma'am.
- I'm going to bed.

01:46:20.682 --> 01:46:22.480
Come on, you, up to bed.

01:46:24.202 --> 01:46:24.873
Night.

01:46:26.955 --> 01:46:28.377
Good night, boys.

01:46:33.086 --> 01:46:35.088
Hey, come on, Forrest.
Come on.

01:46:35.255 --> 01:46:37.257
Why don't you show us a dance?

01:46:38.967 --> 01:46:41.265
Come on, Uncle Forrest, get up.
Come on!

01:46:41.594 --> 01:46:44.768
- Come on.
- I ain't dancing for you two jackasses.

01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:48.026
- Come on, huh?

01:46:48.184 --> 01:46:49.857
I'm gonna go get me some air.

01:46:51.521 --> 01:46:53.523
- Do one move.
- No.

01:46:53.690 --> 01:46:58.116
- Here we go, here we go! Oh, oh...
- Come on...

01:46:58.278 --> 01:47:00.497
- There ain't enough space.

01:47:00.655 --> 01:47:02.953
Let him walk it off.

01:47:04.868 --> 01:47:08.122
Yep, I'm gonna...
I'm going to bed, too.

01:47:08.288 --> 01:47:11.963
It's too damn cold to be sitting
out here on this porch.

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.133
Midnight's upon us already.

01:47:16.713 --> 01:47:18.135
Night, Forrest.

01:47:21.176 --> 01:47:22.849
- Night, Jack.
- Good night.

01:47:29.309 --> 01:47:32.233
<i>Forrest once said
nothing could kill us,</i>

01:47:32.395 --> 01:47:34.022
<i>that we could never die.</i>

01:47:35.857 --> 01:47:38.326
<i>And back then I think
I actually believed it.</i>

01:47:39.736 --> 01:47:41.579
<i>Hell, I know Forrest did.</i>

01:47:44.157 --> 01:47:46.580
<i>'Cause no matter what
this world flung at him</i>

01:47:47.660 --> 01:47:50.755
<i>he seemed to be able to just
stand up and keep on going.</i>

01:47:52.332 --> 01:47:54.175
<i>Getting a little more bent,</i>

01:47:54.334 --> 01:47:56.211
<i>a little more twisted each time.</i>

01:48:00.256 --> 01:48:02.884
<i>But nobody leaves
this world alive.</i>

01:48:03.885 --> 01:48:06.104
<i>- Not even Forrest.</i>

01:48:24.322 --> 01:48:26.290
<i>And in the end,</i>

01:48:26.449 --> 01:48:29.077
<i>it was dumb luck
and pneumonia that got him.</i>

01:48:32.455 --> 01:48:35.459
<i>It was as simple
and indifferent as that.</i>

01:48:40.964 --> 01:48:44.434
<i>Nowadays, we Bondurants
abide by the law.</i>

01:48:44.592 --> 01:48:48.642
<i>People ain't trying to cut our throats,
stab us, shoot us no more.</i>

01:48:52.058 --> 01:48:53.981
<i>Them days are long gone.</i>

01:48:57.230 --> 01:48:58.903
<i>Sometimes when I'm out on the porch,</i>

01:48:59.065 --> 01:49:01.944
<i>just sitting around doing nothing,</i>

01:49:02.110 --> 01:49:03.828
<i>hell...</i>

01:49:03.987 --> 01:49:07.662
<i>...it sure does get
real quiet around here.</i>
