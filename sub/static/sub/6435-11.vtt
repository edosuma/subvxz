WEBVTT

00:03.470 --> 00:05.004
Jesus!

00:05.006 --> 00:07.006
Just the man
I want to see.

00:07.008 --> 00:09.008
Damn, Lloyd, you back
on the street, man?

00:09.010 --> 00:10.209
What happened?

00:10.211 --> 00:12.044
You and Vic had
another roomie spat?

00:12.046 --> 00:13.379
Yeah, my ex-best friend
kicked me out.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.813
I don't give
a damn about him.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.815
I couldn't tell you how it was
living with that punk.

00:16.817 --> 00:17.983
He's a tyrant.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.152
Act like he's
the mayor of something.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.687
"Lloyd, wash
your ass, Lloyd.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.955
"Wash your ass, Lloyd.

00:22.957 --> 00:24.490
Ass. Ass. Ass."

00:24.492 --> 00:25.624
He was obsessed.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.793
I was like, "Damn, why you
worried about my ass?"

00:27.795 --> 00:30.029
'Cause your ass stink, Lloyd.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.897
Whatever.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.799
He gonna get what's
coming to him.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.300
Have a little food there, Jesus.

00:36.669 --> 00:38.470
Oh, thanks, Lloyd.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.672
Get as much as you
want now, Jesus.

00:40.674 --> 00:44.009
Now... um, I want to talk
to you about my Christmas list.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.678
Now, I've been very good.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.414
I've been... I'm talking about
I've been excellent.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.749
And I got a long list of things
that I want for Christmas.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.318
Thank you for the food, man,
but I've been telling folks

00:53.320 --> 00:54.987
to miss me with that
"I've been good" shit, man.

00:54.989 --> 00:57.756
Take it to that fat white
(bleep) down at the mall, brah.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.925
But it's Christmas.
Yeah, I know it's Christmas.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.260
It's my birthday.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.828
Why you got to get shit
on my birthday?

01:02.830 --> 01:04.029
I don't get shit on yours, man.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.531
(bleep) out of here.

01:05.533 --> 01:06.698
Jesus!

01:06.700 --> 01:08.267
Come back here!

01:08.269 --> 01:11.103
You better learn
what Christmas is all about!

01:42.802 --> 01:45.137
JESUS:
<i>Man, people always surprised</i>
<i>to hear how I hate Christmas,</i>

01:45.139 --> 01:47.706
<i>but they shouldn't be, 'cause</i>
<i>Christmas is some bullshit.</i>

01:47.708 --> 01:49.274
<i>It's supposed to be</i>
<i>about giving,</i>

01:49.276 --> 01:51.276
<i>but every year</i>
<i>the takers come out.</i>

01:51.278 --> 01:52.978
<i>Case in point.</i>

01:52.980 --> 01:54.546
Jesus.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.981
(laughs)

01:55.983 --> 01:57.816
I'm sorry, did I
wake you? My bad.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.551
Early Christmas
present.

01:59.553 --> 02:02.121
Happy birthday to
the King of kings.

02:02.123 --> 02:03.589
(laughs)

02:03.591 --> 02:05.190
(chuckles)

02:09.596 --> 02:13.432
And there's more
where that came from

02:13.434 --> 02:14.800
if you just come to
my Christmas party.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.802
Man, you can keep this
little funky-ass weed, man.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.505
I told you I wasn't coming
to your party, Ms. Tudi.

02:19.507 --> 02:22.074
Jesus, baby, please,
you got to come.

02:22.076 --> 02:23.842
Because I've already
sent out invitations

02:23.844 --> 02:25.777
and-and e-mails with
your picture on it.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.813
Merry Christmas,
Ms. Tudi.
Merry Christmas, baby.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.349
You always have me on some
exploitative shit, man.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.683
Just like last year.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.619
Remember you set up
the little photo booth

02:33.621 --> 02:35.420
and charged people $20 a head?

02:35.422 --> 02:37.589
A dub a head!
Right, right.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.924
To take a picture with me.
That was good!

02:38.926 --> 02:41.093
No, it wasn't good, man--
You had drunk (bleep)

02:41.095 --> 02:43.428
sitting on my lap,
spilling drink all on my garb.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.796
Smelling like yak all night;

02:44.798 --> 02:46.798
is that how you want to be
treated for your birthday?

02:46.800 --> 02:48.634
MS. TUDI: All right, well,
listen here-- this is different.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.836
Now, I got the
best idea ever.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.504
Okay, check this out.

02:52.506 --> 02:56.041
A live nativity scene
on my front lawn

02:56.043 --> 02:58.110
starring... you!

02:58.112 --> 03:00.012
Huh?!
(laughs)

03:00.014 --> 03:01.947
You want me to be
a lawn ornament?

03:01.949 --> 03:03.882
That's some bullshit,
Ms. Tudi.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.217
You know what?

03:05.219 --> 03:07.286
I'm thinking about Buddhism.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.787
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:13.993 --> 03:17.062
Well, well, well, if it ain't
the Australian con man.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.163
Merry Christmas, nigga.

03:18.165 --> 03:20.165
Hey, Vic.

03:20.167 --> 03:22.234
Did you really
kick Lloyd out, man?

03:22.236 --> 03:23.802
On Christmas, brah?

03:23.804 --> 03:25.237
Hell yeah, I did.

03:25.239 --> 03:26.805
He's a degenerate.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.473
A lowlife.

03:28.475 --> 03:31.243
Got a horrible work ethic,
just like you.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.811
You know, man,
that's some (bleep) up shit

03:32.813 --> 03:34.880
to tell a brother
on his birthday, man.
Birthday?

03:34.882 --> 03:36.315
That's right. Yeah.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.983
Well, I got some good
news for you, man.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.485
Gift straight from God.
(chuckling): Wha...?

03:40.487 --> 03:42.654
Hey, Pops blessed you
with a gift?

03:42.656 --> 03:45.757
The Word?! Ah, man, that's
the gift that keep on giving.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.360
Come on, lay it on me, man,
come on, what'd he say?

03:48.362 --> 03:49.695
He says, "Beware
of false prophets

03:49.697 --> 03:51.697
"and those that would
disguise themselves

03:51.699 --> 03:53.699
"to be servants
of righteousness.

03:53.701 --> 03:56.702
"Their end will correspond
with their deeds,

03:56.704 --> 03:59.871
"as they will be hurled into
a lake of burning sulfur

03:59.873 --> 04:04.509
to be tormented day in
and day out forever."

04:04.511 --> 04:06.545
Vic, man,
I-I don't think

04:06.547 --> 04:08.280
that was supposed
to be taken literally, brah.

04:08.282 --> 04:11.683
In your case, you better
take it literally.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.019
You going to
Hell, con man.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.354
In case you didn't know,

04:15.356 --> 04:17.956
that's a whole lot
hotter than Australia.

04:22.228 --> 04:24.363
Hater, man.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.399
Man, everybody can miss me

04:27.401 --> 04:29.401
with this stupid-ass
holiday bullshit.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.937
Oh, man, here this
nigga go again.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.272
Nah, man, seriously though.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.906
Whatever that is they
out there celebrating

04:34.908 --> 04:36.241
ain't got shit to do with me.

04:36.243 --> 04:40.245
FISH: Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know,
Jesus-- you hate Christmas.

04:40.247 --> 04:42.547
Everybody knows
that you hate Christmas.

04:42.549 --> 04:43.815
Yeah, man, why you got
to (bleep) it up

04:43.817 --> 04:45.083
for the rest of us, man?

04:45.085 --> 04:47.619
You want to be known as the
Jesus that ruined Christmas?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.288
FISH: Yeah, man, don't be
ruining our Christmas

04:49.290 --> 04:50.622
just 'cause you
in a bad mood.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.257
So we gonna celebrate
your birthday

04:52.259 --> 04:54.126
a little early this year.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.627
(chuckles)

04:57.497 --> 04:59.298
(laughing):
Oh, snap!

04:59.300 --> 05:01.433
Hey, y'all did
this for me?

05:01.435 --> 05:03.669
(laughs)

05:05.505 --> 05:07.739
Yeah, man, so cheer
your ass up, man.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.074
We got you.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.409
Your homies got
your back, man.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.377
Hey, things could be
a lot worse.

05:13.179 --> 05:14.946
(knocking on door)

05:14.948 --> 05:17.683
Get the door, Jay.

05:19.285 --> 05:20.819
Hey, baby.
(coughs)

05:20.821 --> 05:22.821
What's up?

05:22.823 --> 05:23.855
Your mail.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.424
I don't know why I'm
still getting it--

05:25.426 --> 05:26.958
we haven't lived
together in ages.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.293
Oh, thank you, baby.

05:28.295 --> 05:30.329
You ain't even have
to do all that.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.331
Hey, Dianne.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.932
Want to come inside
and kick it?

05:33.934 --> 05:35.200
Nah, I'm cool.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.969
Ah.
All right, well, have
fun "kicking it."

05:37.971 --> 05:39.971
(speaks in Spanish)

05:39.973 --> 05:42.641
Have fun shooting people.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.476
Jay, you need to go
with her, man.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.644
It's your destiny, man.

05:45.646 --> 05:46.812
She want to spend
Christmas with you.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.548
Nah, I'll just
call her later.

05:50.883 --> 05:52.884
Hey, Jesus, what am I
getting this year?

05:52.886 --> 05:55.454
Nothing, man, your daddy's an
alcoholic and he lost his job.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.955
Stop being so self-centered.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.124
(child sobs)

05:59.126 --> 06:01.126
Jesus, man, you shouldn't
do stuff like that.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.662
Nah, they don't care about
nothing but theyself, man.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.364
People are over
Christmas now.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.799
You're not the only one who
hates your birthday, all right?

06:07.801 --> 06:10.001
You don't have a job,
you don't have no money,

06:10.003 --> 06:11.136
you can't go shopping.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.338
To be honest, we all
wish we could skip it.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.006
And I wish I could
just skip being

06:15.008 --> 06:16.575
the Holy Redeemer
and the Heavenly Savior.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.310
All right, now you
just talking crazy.

06:18.312 --> 06:20.412
Nah, man, I'm telling
the truth, man.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.180
Sometimes I don't even want
to be Jesus no more.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.216
Here I am spreading the goodness
and the (bleep) light,

06:24.218 --> 06:25.684
you feel me?
That's all I know.

06:25.686 --> 06:28.420
But all they know is
the Santa Claus bullshit.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.355
Hey, brah, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.523
Ah, here we go, man.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.891
Why you got to
mess with me, man?

06:32.893 --> 06:35.427
Man, you are too agitated
and too black right now.

06:35.429 --> 06:37.763
And this outfit is offensive--
it's Christmas.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.332
You right-- it<i> is</i> Christmas.

06:40.334 --> 06:42.033
It's<i> my</i> birthday!

06:42.035 --> 06:43.201
My (bleep) birthday!

06:43.203 --> 06:45.837
(bleep) all this
hyper-consumerism bullshit!

06:45.839 --> 06:47.572
This ain't
what Christmas is about!

06:47.574 --> 06:49.541
It's about getting
your boy what he want!

06:49.543 --> 06:51.943
And what I want
is peace on (bleep) Earth!

06:51.945 --> 06:52.778
Donnie!

06:52.780 --> 06:54.613
We on top of this (bleep)!

06:54.615 --> 06:57.048
Donnie!
Oh, yeah, bitch-ass
Santa Claus.

06:57.050 --> 07:00.152
Hey, man,
it's his birthday, man, oh!

07:04.957 --> 07:06.191
Donnie!

07:06.193 --> 07:08.126
(grunting)

07:12.298 --> 07:15.267
Jesus, are you okay?

07:15.269 --> 07:17.569
Quick, we need an ambulance!

07:17.571 --> 07:19.571
(echoing):
Jesus! Jesus!

07:19.573 --> 07:21.139
Are you okay?

07:21.141 --> 07:23.975
(echoing):
<i>Are you okay? ...you okay?</i>

07:25.711 --> 07:28.747
All right, so,
how you feeling?

07:28.749 --> 07:30.715
That's a pretty nasty
bump you got there.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.217
But no concussions

07:32.219 --> 07:33.418
or serious damage.

07:33.420 --> 07:34.586
What day is it?

07:34.588 --> 07:37.422
Still Christmas Eve.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.890
Are my, are my friends here?

07:38.892 --> 07:41.259
You didn't come
with any friends.

07:41.261 --> 07:42.994
Look, I just need you to
fill out a few documents,

07:42.996 --> 07:44.763
and I'll have you
on your way, Fred.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.431
Wait...

07:46.433 --> 07:47.899
What you call me, brah?

07:47.901 --> 07:50.302
Fred.
Fred Bethlehem?

07:50.304 --> 07:53.171
At least, that's what's
on your driver's license.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.573
(scoffs)

07:54.575 --> 07:56.641
I don't have
a driver's license, man.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.044
Somebody should've
told this guy.

08:00.112 --> 08:01.746
Hmm.

08:01.748 --> 08:04.416
(laughing): You were
born on Christmas Day.

08:04.418 --> 08:05.750
That must suck!

08:05.752 --> 08:07.452
(sighs)
Look,

08:07.454 --> 08:09.454
Doctor, somebody
made a huge mistake.

08:09.456 --> 08:10.856
Man, that's not me, brah.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.958
L-Like I said, that's
a pretty nasty bump.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.260
But it'll all start
coming back to you soon...

08:15.262 --> 08:16.695
Fred.

08:18.297 --> 08:20.165
I got to get out of here.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.666
<i>Hey, Pops, it's me, man.</i>

08:21.668 --> 08:23.969
There's some strange shit
going on down here.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.837
And I really need you to holler
at me with the quickness.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.273
Until then, I'm just gonna
assume it was your divine hand

08:28.275 --> 08:29.674
putting in work.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.676
In my resplendent
and illustrious name,

08:31.678 --> 08:33.311
I pray, Pops.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.680
Amen, amen.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.883
Oh, my bad, Lloyd.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.284
You good?

08:39.286 --> 08:40.452
What the hell?

08:40.454 --> 08:41.520
Oh, Freddie, hey!

08:41.522 --> 08:43.154
What's going on, man?

08:43.156 --> 08:45.223
Listen, I'm just up here
enjoying the day,

08:45.225 --> 08:48.326
taking a nice little nap, man.
How you been, Freddie?

08:48.328 --> 08:50.595
Darby?

08:54.534 --> 08:55.667
No, I'm not cool!

08:55.669 --> 08:57.335
What is you doing out
here on the streets,

08:57.337 --> 08:58.837
looking like Lloyd?!
Hold up, nigga.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.739
I might be dirty, nasty

09:00.741 --> 09:02.140
and drunker than a (bleep),

09:02.142 --> 09:03.708
but I damn sure
don't look like no Lloyd!

09:03.710 --> 09:04.843
That's just mean.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.011
Hey, fellas,
how's it going?

09:06.013 --> 09:07.579
Hey, it's that doctor!

09:07.581 --> 09:10.215
I ain't no doctor.
That-that's my side hustle.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.316
This is my real job.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.517
How's your head, Fred?

09:12.519 --> 09:13.919
Everything okay?

09:13.921 --> 09:15.720
(laughs):
Oh, okay, I get it.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.689
You ain't no doctor, man.
You a angel!

09:17.691 --> 09:19.824
You can't fool me, man.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.026
I know angels when I see them.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.194
Guilty!
(laughs)

09:23.196 --> 09:24.729
Freddie,
you-you okay, man?

09:24.731 --> 09:26.197
Brah, I told you, man.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.933
My name ain't Freddie, man.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.935
It's Jesus H. Christ.
Come on, you know me, brah.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.202
Nigga, you on the pipe?

09:31.204 --> 09:33.705
Actually your name
was Jesus H. Christ.

09:33.707 --> 09:36.942
Now you're Freddie Bethlehem,
ordinary negro.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.510
Retired-foreign-league

09:38.512 --> 09:40.378
basketball-playing-looking
(bleep).

09:40.380 --> 09:41.880
And look at your boy Jason.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.748
Without Jesus in his life.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.216
Piece of shit, Bobby Brown

09:45.218 --> 09:47.686
reject-looking (bleep)--
look at him!

09:47.688 --> 09:50.388
He's given up.
Nigga, you know
I can hear you?

09:50.390 --> 09:51.790
All right, so look, man,
you never

09:51.792 --> 09:52.857
did answer my question, man.

09:52.859 --> 09:53.892
This-this is all Pops

09:53.894 --> 09:55.093
trying to teach me some little

09:55.095 --> 09:56.227
Christmas lesson
or something, right?

09:56.229 --> 09:57.596
No, this is not Pops

09:57.598 --> 09:59.364
teaching you some type
of Christmas lesson.

09:59.366 --> 10:02.300
It's Pops granting<i> you</i>
your Christmas wish.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.636
You're not Jesus anymore.

10:04.638 --> 10:08.106
(laughs)

10:08.108 --> 10:10.241
JESUS:
You're (bleep) with me, right?

10:10.243 --> 10:11.743
I mean, Pops took away
my divinity?

10:11.745 --> 10:13.912
Have you noticed how hard
it is to reach him now?

10:13.914 --> 10:16.481
Ordinary people
can't reach God.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.783
They need you.
Ain't this a bitch?

10:18.785 --> 10:20.652
(door creaks)

10:22.221 --> 10:24.589
Freddie, how many
times I told you

10:24.591 --> 10:26.391
to stop loitering in
front of Compton Gardens,

10:26.393 --> 10:27.993
giving it a bad name?

10:27.995 --> 10:29.728
Lloyd?!
Jason!

10:29.730 --> 10:32.097
Get that dirty,
funky box out of here!

10:32.099 --> 10:34.599
Package?

10:34.601 --> 10:37.669
And I told you stop throwing
packages over that gate.

10:37.671 --> 10:38.637
Okay, I'm sorry.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.105
You threw one last week.
All right.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.439
And this funky-ass
nigga here got it.

10:41.441 --> 10:44.009
Lies!
And I'm gonna sue your ass.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.343
Mr. Lloyd, I will see you

10:45.345 --> 10:46.645
at the Compton Christmas
Celebration, right?

10:46.647 --> 10:48.146
Oh, yeah,
I'll be there.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.682
(chuckling)

10:50.684 --> 10:53.151
ANGEL: Without you, Lloyd
stayed in the rat race.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.153
And as you can see, look!

10:55.155 --> 10:58.123
He's just a bitter,
angry (bleep).

10:58.125 --> 11:00.458
All right, ah.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.127
Got more packages to deliver.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.162
Hey, wait, though-- if-if-if
Lloyd running the complex,

11:04.164 --> 11:05.463
where Vic at?

11:05.465 --> 11:07.565
Vic's the mayor of Compton!

11:12.104 --> 11:13.638
(Lloyd grunts)

11:13.640 --> 11:15.373
(laughing)

11:19.712 --> 11:22.981
I got a special
Christmas gift for you--

11:22.983 --> 11:25.283
a bullet up your ass.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.552
(laughing)

11:29.822 --> 11:31.222
VIC:
Tudi!

11:31.224 --> 11:32.857
What?

11:32.859 --> 11:34.225
Where's that son of yours?

11:34.227 --> 11:35.794
I need to know quick.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.662
We got 40 minutes
to get down to the park

11:37.664 --> 11:39.330
and it's gonna take me 30
minutes to whip his ass

11:39.332 --> 11:40.365
for what he did.
You didn't say

11:40.367 --> 11:41.666
nothing about no gun.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.501
Now, why you got the gun?
Come on, baby.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.837
This is Compton. It's a lot
of crazy fools out there.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.405
Ain't you the mayor?

11:47.407 --> 11:48.973
Ain't that why you got

11:48.975 --> 11:51.342
all them bodyguards
and Secret Service?

11:51.344 --> 11:52.844
I don't need them niggas.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.412
I'm the sheep dog.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.014
The protector of the flock.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.483
(laughing):
The sheep...?!
That's right.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.552
Hey, what's up, Moms?
Sorry I'm late.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.387
Ooh, ooh.
I had to go get my hair cut.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.422
Uh-oh!
I got a new outfit.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.690
And I got my nails done,
my feet done, new jewelry...

12:05.692 --> 12:06.925
Stop, Boon.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.359
Just stop it.
Stop.

12:08.361 --> 12:12.063
Boonie, I was in
your room earlier.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.066
And I found this.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.202
VIC:
Oh, hell nah! Nah, nah.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.436
It's because of that bitch!

12:18.438 --> 12:20.939
No stepson of mine
gonna be a druggie!

12:20.941 --> 12:24.275
(Boonie screaming)
(Ms. Tudi shouting)

12:24.277 --> 12:26.544
You big-ass bitch!
I'm gonna whip your ass!

12:26.546 --> 12:29.447
That's why the nigga like you!
Wish you had an ass!

12:29.449 --> 12:31.015
Come over here, bitch!
Come here!

12:31.017 --> 12:32.083
(Boonie crying)

12:32.085 --> 12:33.885
Bad! No drugs, nigga!

12:33.887 --> 12:36.354
MS. TUDI:<i> And you gave</i>
<i>my precious Boonie weed!</i>

12:36.356 --> 12:38.790
<i>I'm gonna beat your ass, bitch!</i>

12:38.792 --> 12:40.959
See, it's the mayor
house right here.

12:40.961 --> 12:43.361
Nah, man, this Ms. Tudi's hou--

12:43.363 --> 12:45.697
Vic and Ms. Tudi?

12:45.699 --> 12:47.799
Imagine that.
Without you,

12:47.801 --> 12:49.701
Ms. Tudi never knew
the pleasures of weed.

12:49.703 --> 12:52.637
She became a alcoholic
and married Vic.

12:52.639 --> 12:53.738
What?!

12:53.740 --> 12:55.740
Yep, and without you
around to hate on,

12:55.742 --> 12:58.643
Vic had enough time and energy
to run for mayor and win.

12:58.645 --> 13:01.579
(Boonie shouting)
Is that...
Dianne?

13:01.581 --> 13:03.815
Freddie?

13:03.817 --> 13:05.917
Damn it, Freddie, what the hell
are you doing here?

13:05.919 --> 13:07.118
I'm working!

13:07.120 --> 13:08.486
Hey, look, Dianne,

13:08.488 --> 13:10.588
I-I know this might
sound crazy as (bleep),

13:10.590 --> 13:12.624
but I'm not who
you think I am, girl.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.993
DIANNE:
Yes, you are, Freddie.
You're a loser.

13:14.995 --> 13:18.062
What's this?
You hanging out
with bums, now? Huh?

13:18.064 --> 13:19.264
I've had enough of this.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.598
This relationship is--

13:20.600 --> 13:22.000
(indistinct voice over earpiece)

13:22.002 --> 13:23.635
Yes, sir.
Okay, okay.

13:23.637 --> 13:24.435
(sighs)

13:24.437 --> 13:25.637
Some of us
are working.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.939
Merry Christmas, you asshole.

13:27.941 --> 13:30.008
Man, how you lose
a woman like that?

13:30.010 --> 13:32.277
You know what I'd do
to have a woman like that?

13:32.279 --> 13:33.478
Oh!

13:33.480 --> 13:35.914
Man, that<i> is</i> your woman!

13:35.916 --> 13:37.582
You ain't my daddy!

13:37.584 --> 13:39.250
Everybody, come on,
let's get cleaned up.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.652
I'm sorry.
We gotta get down

13:40.654 --> 13:42.954
to the park and talk
to the people of Compton.

13:42.956 --> 13:46.124
I'm-a finish whupping
your ass when I get back.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.326
I'll be your daddy
then, nigga.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.995
Mayor! Over here!
Mayor, Mayor, over here!

13:50.997 --> 13:52.931
Hey, get that
camera out of here.
Mayor, over here!

13:52.933 --> 13:54.532
Come on, girl...
I-I got it, I got it.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.367
Hey! Boon!
Can I get one?

13:56.369 --> 13:57.836
What's up, Boon?
It's me!

13:57.838 --> 13:59.804
It's your boy, Jesus!
Hey, (bleep) you, man.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.105
Maggie! What's up?
It's your boy, it's Jesus!

14:01.107 --> 14:03.374
Right here!
Come on, man, watch out.

14:05.110 --> 14:06.477
What's up, man?

14:06.479 --> 14:08.179
It's your boy!

14:08.181 --> 14:09.848
ANGEL:
Mayor, let me get one!

14:09.850 --> 14:12.450
Are y'all just gonna
push off old Jesus?

14:12.452 --> 14:14.052
Come on, it's...

14:15.988 --> 14:17.488
Okay.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.990
A'ight, a'ight, dawg.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.326
Look, this is all getting
a little bit too weird.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.728
Okay, Pops, I'm good,
I'm straight.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.897
Tell Pops I got the message,
I understand, I'm straight.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.499
I don't want to not be
Jesus no more; I'm good.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.069
I can't help you, bruh.

14:33.973 --> 14:35.240
Fish...

14:35.242 --> 14:36.841
Hey, you know this
dude named Fish?

14:36.843 --> 14:39.143
Yeah. You talking 'bout
your homeboy Fish, right?

14:39.145 --> 14:40.345
Yeah!

14:40.347 --> 14:42.013
Yeah, you know, the
brown-skinned dude?

14:42.015 --> 14:43.815
Thug nigga?
Yes, yes!

14:43.817 --> 14:45.516
I always liked Fish, man.
Yeah...

14:45.518 --> 14:47.018
You know, he-he my kind
of dude right there.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.186
Uh, where he at, though?

14:48.188 --> 14:49.587
Oh, he dead.

14:50.689 --> 14:51.689
Yeah.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.925
Police kill him
for selling burned DVDs.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.159
Mm-hmm.

14:55.161 --> 14:56.594
Shame.

14:57.863 --> 14:59.697
Wh... Wh... Where?

14:59.699 --> 15:02.467
Couple blocks
up that way.

15:04.169 --> 15:06.004
Crazy nigga.

15:07.439 --> 15:10.008
Nah, Pops.
Pops, come on, Pops.

15:10.010 --> 15:13.444
I'm sorry I hated
on Christmas so hard, Pops.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.580
I'm sorry I s...
I said I didn't want to be

15:15.582 --> 15:17.782
your Divine and Holy Son
no more, Pops.

15:17.784 --> 15:20.184
(sobbing)

15:22.221 --> 15:25.623
It's too late for Fish, Freddie.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.692
Jesus was the only one

15:27.694 --> 15:28.726
holding him down
in these streets.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.361
And you better
hurry up,

15:30.363 --> 15:32.730
because Fish won't be
the only dead homie out here.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.799
Lloyd is planning
on assassinating Vic

15:34.801 --> 15:37.068
at the Christmas
in Compton celebration.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.736
Assassinate Vic?

15:38.738 --> 15:41.606
Without you, Lloyd became
a radical libertarian.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.807
<i>He thinks Vic's a tyrant.</i>

15:42.809 --> 15:45.209
(Lloyd chuckling maniacally)

15:45.211 --> 15:47.278
(bleep) is crazy.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.814
No, Pops, this can't be right.

15:49.816 --> 15:52.116
Pops, this ain't right, Pops!

15:52.118 --> 15:53.318
Come on, Pops.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.919
Come on,
let's fix this, Pops,

15:54.921 --> 15:56.754
come on, Pops,
send me a sign, Pops.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.156
This ain't real, man!

15:58.158 --> 15:59.657
Oh, no, it's real, it's real.

15:59.659 --> 16:00.992
Here go your sign
right here.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.461
You put it up there. Look.
Say "Freddie B."

16:03.463 --> 16:05.229
Mm-hmm.

16:09.001 --> 16:11.669
(chuckling)

16:13.939 --> 16:16.341
Now that's what I'm talking
'bout, pimp?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.943
Thanks, Pops.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.111
Come on, Jay.

16:20.113 --> 16:21.312
(chuckling)

16:21.314 --> 16:23.181
Hey, nigga, slow down.

16:24.750 --> 16:28.653
VIC:
Welcome, and Merry Christmas.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.988
As we all know,

16:29.990 --> 16:32.790
Christmas is a time
for happiness.

16:32.792 --> 16:33.992
Joy.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.460
Family.

16:35.462 --> 16:38.629
And family is what I want
to talk to y'all about today.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.798
See, we have a scourge
in our neighborhoods

16:40.800 --> 16:44.535
and that scourge is called
marijuana.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.004
Why, I just caught my stepson

16:46.006 --> 16:47.605
smoking marijuana
just this morning.

16:47.607 --> 16:48.840
Yeah, that's right, Boonie.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.808
You (bleep) up Christmas
for everybody!

16:50.810 --> 16:54.879
That's why, henceforth,
as your mayor, I declare,

16:54.881 --> 16:58.316
okay, that in spite
of the liberals

16:58.318 --> 17:01.719
and all these other hippies
running around talking shit,

17:01.721 --> 17:04.188

17:04.190 --> 17:09.060
will remain
illegal in Compton forever.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.895
That's right, 'cause we gonna
have a clean Compton.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.730
A Compton where little babies

17:12.732 --> 17:15.199
can breathe freely.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.201
A Compton where kids
can walk to school

17:17.203 --> 17:18.636
without walking through
a cloud of smoke.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.004
We pushing for a new Compton!

17:20.006 --> 17:22.673
A Compton where niggas
remember they last name!

17:22.675 --> 17:25.243
Where we no longer have to spend

17:25.245 --> 17:27.345
half our paychecks on chips

17:27.347 --> 17:29.480
from smoking weed
and gettin' the munchies.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.349
We gonna move forward...
Can't let the
tyrant get away!

17:31.351 --> 17:33.751
What the hell are you
doing here, Lloyd?!

17:33.753 --> 17:35.119
LLOYD: Sending your
black ass home!

17:36.555 --> 17:39.157
(people shouting, screaming)

17:39.159 --> 17:41.125
Aah!

17:44.363 --> 17:46.264
MS. TUDI:

17:46.266 --> 17:48.166

17:51.770 --> 17:53.404
MS. TUDI:

17:53.406 --> 17:54.839
(screams, sobs)

17:54.841 --> 17:56.774
MS. TUDI:
Oh, my baby!

17:56.776 --> 17:58.910
OFFICER: It's the Mayor
and his wife!
Babe! My baby!

17:58.912 --> 18:00.211
OFFICER:
We need backup!

18:00.213 --> 18:01.512

18:01.514 --> 18:03.748
Pops, Pops, please...

18:03.750 --> 18:05.216
MS. TUDI (sobbing):

18:05.218 --> 18:07.085

Please, Pops, I've had it...

18:07.087 --> 18:10.221
MAGGIE:
Jesus! Are you okay?

18:10.223 --> 18:12.256
Jesus... are you okay?

18:14.726 --> 18:16.094
What day is it?

18:16.096 --> 18:18.129
You're okay!

18:18.131 --> 18:19.430
It's Christmas Eve.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.132
You dating Boonie?

18:21.134 --> 18:22.633
Ew.

18:22.635 --> 18:23.935
No, I tried to give her
some money,

18:23.937 --> 18:25.236
but she wouldn't go for it.

18:25.238 --> 18:28.473
It ain't too late.
It's ain't too late!

18:28.475 --> 18:30.208
It ain't too late!
Hallelujah!

18:30.210 --> 18:31.576
He did it, y'all!

18:31.578 --> 18:33.311
It ain't too late,
you know, he did it.

18:33.313 --> 18:36.714
God delivered us from the most
(bleep) up Christmas ever!

18:37.449 --> 18:39.350
Eh...
Merry Christmas!

18:42.754 --> 18:44.655
JESUS:<i> All right,</i>
<i>so maybe I need to chill out</i>

18:44.657 --> 18:46.257
<i>on Christmas, man.</i>

18:46.259 --> 18:49.093
<i>Problem is, we put way too much</i>
<i>on it, you know?</i>

18:49.095 --> 18:50.828

18:57.237 --> 18:58.336
(laughter)

18:59.905 --> 19:02.640
Merry Christmas, buddy.

19:02.642 --> 19:06.611
Hey, man, why don't you come in
and have some Christmas dinner?

19:06.613 --> 19:08.279

19:21.961 --> 19:24.495
