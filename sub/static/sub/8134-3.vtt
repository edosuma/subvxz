Shadowhunters...

00:06.507 --> 00:08.340
My mother told me
she hid something
from someone.

00:08.342 --> 00:11.276
The Mortal Cup is
the most important object
in the Shadow World.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.948
And you know exactly
what'd happen if Valentine
gets the cup before we do.

00:16.450 --> 00:20.419
Maybe a little medicine
will trigger your memory.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.822
I suggest
you find Clary soon.
I will.

00:23.824 --> 00:26.458
If anyone can
tell me another way
to recover my memories,

00:26.460 --> 00:27.693
I'm listening.

00:27.695 --> 00:28.794
If they're as bad
as they say they are,

00:28.796 --> 00:30.462
it's not good
for Clary, is it?

00:30.464 --> 00:31.864
It's not good for any of us.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.800
I've drawn this before.
But I don't know
what it means.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.186
[gasps]

00:37.187 --> 00:39.571
We're negotiating.
The mundane in exchange
for the Mortal Cup.

[Clary]
My mother lied to me.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.942
My father is Valentine.

00:47.481 --> 00:50.215
I still don't understand.
How can Shadowhunters
be better than...

00:50.217 --> 00:51.717
than what you people
call mundanes?

00:51.719 --> 00:53.485
Because we protect humans.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.254
[sighs]
You're right.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.991
Humans. You protect humans.

00:58.993 --> 01:02.027
You left Simon
all alone in the van.

01:02.029 --> 01:03.779
Great job, guys. You rock.

01:03.780 --> 01:05.530
There is some truth
to the idea that
human beings should have

01:05.533 --> 01:06.999
a modicum of common sense.
[Clary scoffs]

01:07.001 --> 01:08.767
Alec, not now.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.536
Look, they won't do
anything to Simon.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.171
They just wanted
to draw you out.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.772
They want the Cup,
and they think you have it.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.674
But why do they think that?
Why does anyone think that?

01:15.676 --> 01:18.177
What, my mom lies to me
my entire life except,

01:18.179 --> 01:19.678
"Oh, by the way,
there's this magic cup,

01:19.680 --> 01:21.780
I hid on, like,
the planet Bongo,
but don't tell anyone."

01:23.117 --> 01:26.185
[sighs] What am I
supposed to do now?

01:26.187 --> 01:28.020
We have to report
to the Clave.
Great.

01:28.022 --> 01:30.189
They have to know
we've learned
about Valentine.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.523
What, that he's my father?

01:32.393 --> 01:34.026
Great. Fine.
Tell them.

01:34.028 --> 01:36.028
What good does that do Simon?

01:36.030 --> 01:38.464
Clary, it's all connected.
The vamps want the Cup.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.798
Why? It makes
new Shadowhunters.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.401
Nobody wants Valentine
forming an army
loyal to himself.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.269
Plus, it controls demons.

01:44.872 --> 01:47.606
They'll propose a trade.
Simon for the Cup.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.441
So, vampires will trade
Simon for the Cup

01:49.443 --> 01:51.844
and Valentine will trade
my mother for the Cup.

01:52.113 --> 01:53.779
Either way,
I lose someone I love.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.082
What if I just
toss it up in the air

01:57.084 --> 01:59.051
and let them fight it
out among themselves?

01:59.053 --> 02:00.619
So this doesn't
matter to you?

02:00.621 --> 02:02.121
Yes, of course,
it matters!

02:04.291 --> 02:07.893
Listen...
when you saved my life...

02:07.895 --> 02:09.628
I put my trust in you.

Now, I need you
to put your trust in me.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.668
I can't turn into
what you are overnight.

It's true.
She was raised as a mundane.

Anyone?

02:27.948 --> 02:31.250
I'm just
an accounting student.
I have no value to anyone.

02:31.252 --> 02:34.186
[stuttering]
And I barely saw your faces,

02:34.188 --> 02:37.322
so if you let me go,
I couldn't even identify you.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.092
Not that I would,
'cause you guys are vampires!

02:40.094 --> 02:41.760
Who would believe me?

02:41.762 --> 02:43.996
I didn't even know
you guys existed

02:46.433 --> 02:47.833
Is anyone there?

02:50.471 --> 02:52.538
If your goal was to scare
the crap out of me,

02:52.540 --> 02:53.839
mission accomplished!

And as far as
I'm concerned...

02:56.443 --> 02:58.777
[stutters] you can
have it out with
those Shadowhunters.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.145
Especially,
the blonde one.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.549
You know, you don't need me.

I mean, can any of this
help me find Simon?

03:16.530 --> 03:19.398
Where is he, anyway?
Some kind of crypt
in Transylvania?

03:19.400 --> 03:21.567
Actually, no.
That was Camille's
outfit, right?

03:21.569 --> 03:23.052
They're locals.

03:23.053 --> 03:24.536
They're at the Hotel DuMort,
down in Gansevoort Street.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.805
And we came back here?
Why? We have to go there.

03:26.807 --> 03:27.906
Let's go, now. Come on.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.374
We need a Clave
resolution for that.

03:29.376 --> 03:32.344
The four of us can't
declare war on the vamps
all by ourselves.

03:32.346 --> 03:35.080
And we can't react
without considering
our options.

03:35.082 --> 03:38.150
Downworlders are slaves
to their impulses. We're not.

03:38.152 --> 03:40.085
Alec, you can't just jump
on all the Downworlders.

03:40.087 --> 03:42.721
Oh, that's right.
Seelies have their charms,
apparently.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.189
Right?
"Seelies"?

03:44.191 --> 03:46.024
Like faeries.
The Fair Folk.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.193
Add pixies, nixies, elves...

03:48.195 --> 03:49.661
anybody half-angel,
half-demon.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.897
It's pretty much
a catch-all term.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.600
Izzy can tell
you all about them.
She's got a thing.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.902
We've all got our things,
don't we?

03:57.905 --> 04:01.373
Okay, I can't listen to this.
Simon's been kidnapped
by vampires.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.609
I guess I'll just
take care of it myself.

04:03.611 --> 04:04.743
Clary, you're gonna
get yourself killed.

04:05.179 --> 04:07.412
Clary. Simon, too.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.085
Then help me.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.953
While we consider
other options,

04:14.955 --> 04:16.521
my best friend is suffering.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.826
Is that something
Shadowhunters understand
or am I just being a mundane?

04:26.267 --> 04:27.866
Clary's right.

04:30.204 --> 04:31.637
They made the first move.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.739
We're gonna take care
of this ourselves,
right now.

04:33.741 --> 04:34.973
This is a bad idea. I--

04:34.975 --> 04:36.341
What, have you got
a better one?

04:37.444 --> 04:39.611
Look, the vamps
broke the Accords.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.613
They kidnapped a mundie.
That's a big no-no.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.248
The Clave will
give us a lecture

04:43.250 --> 04:44.716
and then they'll
be glad we did it.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.551
Come on.
Hard to argue with that.

04:46.553 --> 04:49.321
Even if we went ahead,
I don't see how we
get out of here

04:49.323 --> 04:51.757
without having to explain
where we're going.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.359
We need weapons,
and we can't let
anyone see us get them.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.463
I know where to get
what we need.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.466
[siren wailing in distance]

05:08.742 --> 05:10.409
[Simon] So how does this end?

05:10.411 --> 05:12.911
Do I, uh...
do I get out of here or what?

05:12.913 --> 05:14.913
The answer to that
is above my paygrade.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.749
Paygrade?
They... they pay vampires?

05:17.751 --> 05:20.519
Let's just say
we invest early and often.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.429
I really hate fidgeting.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.597
I'm just, uh...
just looking.
For a way out?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.334
Ooh. [inhales sharply]

05:35.336 --> 05:37.136
There isn't one.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.937
[stutters] I mean, all the,
uh... the cool stuff
you guys collect.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.072

05:43.344 --> 05:45.377
It's-- Whatever.

05:45.379 --> 05:48.580
Leonidas I has been trying
to peddle that junk for years.

05:50.184 --> 05:54.119
Museums make you prove
antiquities are
legit these days.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.887
Yeah, naturally.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.357
[Raphael] When they
ask where you got it,
what do you say?

05:58.359 --> 06:01.193
It's not against the law
to rob my own grave.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.466
Oh, my God.

[grunts] Oh, please.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.708
Honestly,
I just got this jacket.

06:17.544 --> 06:21.480
There's no way out.
You're a hostage,
so accept it.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.714
I'm a hostage?

06:23.684 --> 06:25.050
That means you
won't kill me, yeah?

06:25.652 --> 06:27.419
[Camille] Won't kill you?

06:28.555 --> 06:29.888
Who said that?

06:35.095 --> 06:36.161
Oh, look.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.131
How sweet.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.800
You're bleeding.

06:48.509 --> 06:51.777
I am so looking forward
to getting to know you.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.362
Whose grave is it?

07:10.364 --> 07:13.932
[sighs] Mary Milligan,
born January 10th, 1802.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.368
Died, January 10th, 1878.

07:16.370 --> 07:17.769
All right, Alec,
let's go.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.037
Wait, what are we
looking for?

07:19.039 --> 07:20.138
Cache of weapons.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.140
Stashed here with
Mrs. Milligan.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.276
Why are there
Shadowhunter weapons
in a churchyard?

07:24.278 --> 07:27.145
Because all of
the ancient religions
recognized demons.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.814
Or at least
they used to.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.450
They forgot about the threat
because we've been here
to protect them.

07:32.553 --> 07:35.053
Typical mundane failure
of imagination.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.289
Are you saying we
did too good a job?

07:37.291 --> 07:38.723
You just can't
let up, can you?

07:38.725 --> 07:40.058
You know what?

07:40.060 --> 07:41.960
Alec, why don't you go
check out by the angel?

07:45.499 --> 07:46.965
We couldn't gear up
at the Institute,

07:46.967 --> 07:48.767
but we know our
ancestors left

07:48.769 --> 07:50.469
a cache around
here someplace.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.337
We'll find it.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.940
I always wondered
where my dad was buried.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.642
[sighs] I used to wish
he was still alive.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.513
Be careful
what you wish for.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.482
This isn't your fault.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.817
This is all my fault.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.819
[cell phone beeping]
[Isabelle] Excellent.

08:08.455 --> 08:10.722
He's home.
I'm outta here.

08:11.825 --> 08:12.991
Wait, aren't you
coming with us?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.626
Oh, I wouldn't miss it
for the world,

08:14.628 --> 08:16.728
but I gotta find out
how to get into
the vampires' lair.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.732
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.768
Jace... over here.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.203
Yeah, coming.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.039
Are you gonna be all right?
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be fine.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.174
I'm just, um...

08:29.176 --> 08:30.675
[breathes deeply]

08:30.677 --> 08:32.511
Just give me a minute, okay?

08:33.113 --> 08:34.779
Okay.

08:34.781 --> 08:36.515
[sighs]

08:40.554 --> 08:41.720
[Jace] Yeah?

08:45.292 --> 08:47.893
We're crossing a line
into vamp territory.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.461
That's the point.

08:49.463 --> 08:51.029
Come on, Alec, cheer up.
It's going to be fun.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.732
Damn it, Jace, just...
think this through.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.067
You don't even
like this guy.

08:56.069 --> 08:59.037
This isn't about the mundane,
this is about Clary.

09:00.507 --> 09:03.008
What, are you so desperate
to get laid that you'll risk
killing us?

09:03.010 --> 09:06.144
Wow, um, there's so much
in that that was wrong,

09:06.146 --> 09:07.412
I'm gonna pretend
I didn't hear it.

09:07.414 --> 09:11.049
That's the problem.
You're not listening.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.385
Not to this or anything else
I've said tonight.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.621
You don't even know this girl.
Why do you trust her?

09:17.324 --> 09:19.257
Is this about her being
Valentine's daughter?

09:19.259 --> 09:22.761
Haven't we been
through this?
Alec, look at me.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.829
You can trust her, or not.
I don't care.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.031
That's not my business.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.666
But if you don't
trust me--

09:27.668 --> 09:29.834
[Clary] Jace! Alec!
I think I found it!

09:29.836 --> 09:31.736
Mary Milligan!

09:40.914 --> 09:42.247
Beloved servant?

09:43.450 --> 09:45.600
Who wants that
on a headstone?

09:45.601 --> 09:47.751
Someone who is in service
to a cause greater
than themselves.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.591
At least she is now.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.093
Abracadabra.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.561
Wait, you people
actually say that?

09:56.563 --> 09:58.597
No, Clary, we don't.

10:17.217 --> 10:18.483
[blows]

10:22.222 --> 10:24.656
Whoa! Where's
Mrs. Milligan?

10:26.393 --> 10:29.561
Don't touch that.
You don't know how to use it.

10:29.563 --> 10:32.263
What, like at Pandemonium
when I killed that demon?

10:32.265 --> 10:33.431
You didn't kill--
Alec.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.400
I'm gonna show her
the right way to use it.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.801
Do you see what
you need in here?

10:39.773 --> 10:43.675
No. There's no bow here.
I need one.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.411
I have to rune some arrows.
That's back at the Institute.

10:46.413 --> 10:47.746
I gotta go.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.981
Well, how are you gonna
get back in the Institute?

10:50.917 --> 10:53.718
Go in the back.
Won't bother me
if I'm alone.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.154
Okay, good. Go.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.323
I can finish up here.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.029
[sighs] Hey...

11:05.332 --> 11:06.798
I understand
what we need to do.

11:06.800 --> 11:10.435
And I trust you,
<i>parabatai...</i>

11:10.437 --> 11:12.337
but don't ever doubt me.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.738
No matter what I said.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.674
It's already forgotten.

11:17.678 --> 11:18.943
I'll see you at dawn.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.011
At dawn.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.381
[sighs]

11:27.120 --> 11:28.753
Okay, let me show you
how to use this thing.

11:29.356 --> 11:33.224
Now, it knows
you're a Shadowhunter,
so it wants to respond.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.394
But you have to
be firm with it.
Let it know who's boss.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.966
There.

11:43.236 --> 11:47.072
You make it
a part of yourself
and it a part of you.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.408
Now, the blade never dims.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.944
It's saying you
belong together.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.214
How does it know?

11:57.350 --> 11:59.050
'Cause you're
part angel, Clary...

11:59.720 --> 12:01.619
like all Shadowhunters.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.858
[Clary gasps]

12:06.860 --> 12:08.460
You understand?

12:09.196 --> 12:10.795
Not even a little.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.131
You'll get there.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.001
It's not something
you understand in your mind.

12:17.571 --> 12:20.905
It's something you know
because it's pulsing
through your body.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.409
It's in your blood.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.082
Could I even do this
without you?

12:32.119 --> 12:34.185
You just did.

12:34.187 --> 12:37.922
But it... felt like
you were still with me.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.292
I am.

12:42.629 --> 12:43.995
I will be.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.532
[clears throat]

12:47.534 --> 12:51.269
We... we will be...
there for you.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.272
[chuckles softly]

12:55.041 --> 12:56.441
[sighs]

12:58.044 --> 12:59.244
How do you know
they'll come back?

12:59.246 --> 13:00.545
Who? Alec and Izzy?

13:00.547 --> 13:02.113
Yeah.
We were raised together.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.715
They're basically my
brother and sister.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.917
You know Alec doesn't
like me, right?

13:05.919 --> 13:07.552
Alec doesn't like anybody.

13:07.821 --> 13:08.887
Why would he help me?

13:08.889 --> 13:10.121
Did you hear what he
called me just then?

13:10.123 --> 13:11.623
We're  <i> parabatai.</i>

13:16.296 --> 13:17.562
[exhales]

13:17.564 --> 13:20.965
There's no human bond
that compares to
what Alec and I have.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.333
We're bound together for life.

13:22.335 --> 13:25.503
Bound to fight together,
to protect each other.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.840
In battle,
our hearts beat as one.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.410
If one of us were to die...

13:32.412 --> 13:34.813
a part of the other
would die inside as well.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.819
He'll be here, Clary.

13:42.656 --> 13:43.855
Are you ready?

13:44.624 --> 13:45.757
I'm ready.

13:45.759 --> 13:46.858
You look ready.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.197
I hate throwing things.

13:52.198 --> 13:53.698
[stuttering] I don't...
I literally hate
throwing things.

13:53.700 --> 13:54.933
Even at my own
Bar Mitzvah,

13:54.935 --> 13:57.001
I wouldn't throw spitballs
at a gray table. I mean...

13:57.003 --> 13:59.370
I would never throw things,
honest to God!

13:59.372 --> 14:00.705
Oh, God. You guys
can't say God, right?

14:00.707 --> 14:02.607
For God's sake,
what are you trying to say?

14:02.609 --> 14:04.275
I didn't...
I didn't mean to
throw that thing.

14:04.277 --> 14:07.445
Of course you did, darling.
That's what makes you
so amusing.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.547
I don't find any
of this amusing.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.616
[stuttering] Me neither.
I can't say how sorry I am.

14:11.618 --> 14:12.884
I can pay to have
the whole thing--

14:12.886 --> 14:14.118
[snaps fingers]

14:14.120 --> 14:15.286
Thank you.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.955
The living are
so exhausting.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.656
But this one will be useful.

14:18.658 --> 14:19.724
I don't know.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.562
I'm not sure
breaking the Accords
was the best idea.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.332
If you'll forgive me
for saying so.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.033
I'll forgive,
but I won't agree.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.468
You know as well as I do

14:30.470 --> 14:33.037
Clary Fairchild will come
after her dearest friend...

14:33.039 --> 14:35.073
or whatever he is.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.975
All we have to do is
take her.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.811
Either she has the Cup
or we'll make her
tell us where it is.

14:39.813 --> 14:41.980
She'll bring those
Shadowhunters with her.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.548
They won't get past
the front door.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.584
Even if they do,
we've got them
vastly outnumbered.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.455
Have you ever tasted
Shadowhunter blood?

14:52.225 --> 14:53.758
[whispers]
It's heavenly.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.427
I wouldn't know.
Let's stick to the subject.

14:56.429 --> 14:59.163
Isn't this the wrong time
to be antagonizing the Clave?

14:59.165 --> 15:00.598
They're our best hope

15:00.600 --> 15:02.166
if Valentine really
does make a comeback.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.935
How much longer have I
been at this than you?

15:03.937 --> 15:05.169
Three, four-hundred--

15:05.171 --> 15:06.404
You weren't supposed
to answer that.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.290
Suffice to say,

15:09.291 --> 15:11.408
she who controls
the Mortal Cup,
controls the Shadow World.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.317
He's a tasty little morsel.

15:20.186 --> 15:21.352
Don't you think?

15:21.354 --> 15:23.121
Camille, him?

15:23.123 --> 15:24.455
Remember chocolates?

15:25.959 --> 15:30.795
Sometimes
the plainest candy shell
has the tastiest center.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.367
We'll see.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.438
[snaps fingers]

15:40.440 --> 15:43.508
...so I'd be happy to pay
for a whole new jacket.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.110
[scoffs]

15:48.782 --> 15:50.682
Don't worry,
my little caramel.

15:51.418 --> 15:54.218
Everything will be just fine.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.987
[chuckles nervously]

15:58.792 --> 16:00.858
[soft music playing]

16:03.229 --> 16:04.329
Meliorn?

16:08.401 --> 16:09.801
Isabelle.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.173
Have you missed me?

16:15.608 --> 16:16.975
You know I have.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.682
I thought you'd
be busy tonight.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.521
The only thing
I have to do is you.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.698
Really?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.099
Why aren't you all out looking
for Valentine's daughter?

16:41.101 --> 16:42.934
We're not looking.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.135
So you found her?

16:44.137 --> 16:45.336
[chuckles]

16:46.106 --> 16:47.205
[moans]

16:49.509 --> 16:51.042
That's not an answer.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.014
Is this?

16:57.317 --> 17:00.251
No, but it's clear enough.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.621
Does she have
the Mortal Cup?

17:03.623 --> 17:04.856
Who?

17:04.858 --> 17:06.290
Jocelyn's daughter.

17:06.292 --> 17:09.894
Meliorn, are you trying to
get information out of me?

17:10.797 --> 17:12.030
[whispers] Yes.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.372
And if I had some
questions for you?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.540
I'd have to answer.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.375
You know that.

17:28.481 --> 17:31.049
Seelies can't lie.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.850
But they can evade.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.585
And distract.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.792
Yes, they certainly can.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.735
[beeping]

17:50.737 --> 17:52.236
[whirring]

18:04.050 --> 18:06.084
[rock music playing
over speakers]

18:07.854 --> 18:09.854
[Clary] You wanna kill time
at a biker bar?

18:09.856 --> 18:11.889
We can't move on
the vamps until sunrise.

18:11.891 --> 18:14.258
Plus, there's something
I need in here.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.261
[Clary] What, a drink?
[Jace] I don't drink.

18:17.931 --> 18:21.032
We need to save Simon,
not hang around
a bunch of posers.

18:21.034 --> 18:22.366
[Jace chuckles]

18:23.303 --> 18:24.635
Jace, it's not funny.

18:24.637 --> 18:25.870
It's kinda funny.
[scoffs]

18:25.872 --> 18:28.773
Shouldn't you be
teaching me to fight
vampires or something?

18:29.742 --> 18:31.275
Do me a favor.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.345
Look over there.
What do you see?

18:34.747 --> 18:35.847
[Clary] A lot of people.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.750
Waitress, people making out.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.452
[Jace] Focus on the couple.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.455
Now, concentrate
on seeing through.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.225
Through?

18:47.227 --> 18:50.495
There are layers to reality.
You can peel them away.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.396
See the Shadow World.

18:54.634 --> 18:55.933
Maybe you can.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.502
Don't just use your mind.

18:58.104 --> 18:59.670
Use your whole self.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.706
Relax into it.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.349
Oh, my God.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.185
They're vampires.

19:24.297 --> 19:27.431
Check out that guy.
He's got something.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.467
What? Fleas?
Now, now.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.002
Here you go.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.703
Bet you can't
handle his charm.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.672
Charm?
Are you kidding me?

19:34.674 --> 19:37.341
[Jace] You really
wanna help find Simon?

19:37.343 --> 19:39.911
Go on, go compliment him
on his motorcycle.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.747
They like that.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.186
Hi.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.291
I've been wondering
who owns this awesome bike.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.892
Well, hey, baby.

19:55.828 --> 19:57.094
You like to ride?

20:11.477 --> 20:12.743
[exhales]

20:16.149 --> 20:18.983
You know you smell like
a friggin' angel, right?

20:18.985 --> 20:22.320
But without all that
Shadowhunter rune crap
all over you.

20:24.490 --> 20:25.890
Much better look, right?

20:27.093 --> 20:28.226
Right. [chuckles]

20:28.228 --> 20:30.261
I don't know what the hell
you are, angel doll,

20:30.263 --> 20:31.762
but you're one tasty treat.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.531

Could you tell me

That's not it.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.964
Why do you think we went
to the City of Bones?

21:40.933 --> 21:43.000
She's trying to find
a way to remember,

I missed you when
you were in Idris.

22:25.778 --> 22:26.911
What's the Clave like?

22:28.014 --> 22:30.781
I learned how Shadowhunters
really feel about us.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.784
It's bad enough
not to have a vote.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.553
It's worse to be
treated as inferiors.

22:36.289 --> 22:38.322
They act as if Seelies
aren't half-angel, too.

22:38.324 --> 22:40.991
[laughs] But you're
also half-demon.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.793
You think that makes
us a lesser people?

22:42.795 --> 22:44.829
[chuckles] No,
are you kidding?

22:44.831 --> 22:47.031
Some of us like
a little spice.

I love that you can't lie.
Of course, you don't trust me.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.646
But should I trust you?

23:02.648 --> 23:03.748
To do what?

23:03.750 --> 23:06.317
Oh, I don't know.

23:06.319 --> 23:08.152
Not fool around
with anyone else?

23:08.154 --> 23:10.421
[laughs] Teasing.

23:11.190 --> 23:14.492
Anyway, I know you've
been seeing Camille.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.060
How?

23:16.062 --> 23:18.262
So, you are seeing Camille.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.531
She is very attractive.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.466
No, no. I totally get it.

23:23.336 --> 23:24.835
But how does that work?

23:24.837 --> 23:26.270
Talk about
Shadow World enemies.

23:26.272 --> 23:28.239
Seelies and vampires
don't really speak
to each other

23:28.241 --> 23:29.640
unless they have to.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.675
How do you two manage it?

23:41.354 --> 23:43.120
So do you go to her place?

23:43.523 --> 23:44.588
Sometimes...

23:44.590 --> 23:45.990
Mmm, that's so brave.

23:46.893 --> 23:49.260
A Seelie can't exactly
walk in the front door.

23:51.464 --> 23:54.432
So how would you get in
to the Hotel DuMort?

23:56.569 --> 23:57.701
How would you?

23:57.703 --> 23:59.303
[chuckles]

23:59.305 --> 24:00.805
I asked first.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.941
[inhales deeply]

24:13.820 --> 24:14.952
Alec.

24:17.390 --> 24:18.422
Didn't know you were here.

24:18.424 --> 24:19.490
[stammering]
Yeah, no, I, uh...

24:19.492 --> 24:22.993
Don't tell me.
I don't wanna
have to report you.

24:23.729 --> 24:25.963
It's just that, you know,
Clary is--

24:25.965 --> 24:28.299
That girl is Valentine's--

24:28.301 --> 24:29.967

[groaning]

24:30.470 --> 24:32.102
[exhales]

24:32.104 --> 24:33.604
The monster's daughter.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.272
There must be some reason

24:35.274 --> 24:38.242
why the roaches are
coming out of the
woodwork again, right?

24:38.244 --> 24:39.477
[sighs]

24:41.581 --> 24:42.913
I'll leave you to it.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.081
Hodge?

24:45.518 --> 24:46.684
Thank you.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.320
You remind me of me, Alec.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.289
[inhales]
A loyal friend standing

24:52.291 --> 24:54.692
in the shadow
of the chosen one.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.627
[scoffs]

24:56.629 --> 24:58.095
Hey...

25:00.433 --> 25:02.333
Don't make
the same mistakes I did.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.336
Look where it got me.

25:15.348 --> 25:16.714
Do you wanna jump
on the bike, baby?

25:16.716 --> 25:17.882
Yeah.
All right.

25:17.884 --> 25:19.416
Careful.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.585
Ooh, yeah.

25:22.555 --> 25:23.621
Hey.

25:24.657 --> 25:25.789
You having fun
with my girl?

25:25.791 --> 25:27.992
Piss off, Shadowhunter.

25:27.994 --> 25:29.860
Brad's gonna
take me for a ride.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.061
[whispers]
That's right.

25:31.664 --> 25:32.796
That's not gonna happen.

25:33.399 --> 25:35.199
You heard the lady.
Step aside.

25:37.537 --> 25:39.136
[grunts]

25:39.138 --> 25:41.472
[both chuckle]

25:41.474 --> 25:43.107
Don't move, Clary.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.444

25:51.250 --> 25:52.917
Yoo-hoo, Romeo.
[gasps]

25:53.352 --> 25:54.451
[grunts]

25:57.924 --> 25:59.089
As you were.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.191
Jace, what...

26:01.193 --> 26:02.426
[engine revving]

26:02.428 --> 26:03.594
[tires squealing]

26:11.037 --> 26:12.436
[Clary squeals]

26:15.408 --> 26:17.441
Why did you let him
do that to me?

26:17.443 --> 26:20.678
I couldn't exactly dig around
in his pockets for the keys.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.879
What, you were gonna
let him turn me

26:21.881 --> 26:23.581
into a vampire
just to get his keys?

26:23.583 --> 26:24.882
Don't you trust me?

26:24.884 --> 26:26.283
[engine throttling]

26:27.954 --> 26:30.554
Better hold tight,
this bike runs
on demon energy.

26:30.556 --> 26:32.056
It's pretty mean.

26:32.058 --> 26:33.724
Don't their bikes
run on that, too?

26:33.726 --> 26:37.461
Why do you think
I picked this one?
It's been modified.

26:40.633 --> 26:42.533
But we still have to find--
Simon.

26:42.535 --> 26:44.668
Yes, we'll find
your mundie.

26:45.871 --> 26:47.438
You got a good grip?

26:47.440 --> 26:49.006
You keep asking me that!

27:40.159 --> 27:41.525
[Alec] Izzy.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.863
I got your text.
Where are we exactly?

27:45.865 --> 27:47.998
It's an old meatpacker's
service entrance.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.199
If we go back there,
we come up

27:49.201 --> 27:50.934
into the basement
of the Hotel DuMort.

27:51.937 --> 27:54.021
Perfect, right?

27:54.022 --> 27:56.106
We distract the vamps,
Clary and Jace have time
to find Simon.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.442
Okay.

27:58.444 --> 27:59.510
"Okay"?

27:59.512 --> 28:03.113
It was hard work
interrogating Meliorn
to get this intel.

28:03.683 --> 28:05.182
Great job, Izzy.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.451
You have faerie dust
on your dress.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.821
And I hate being
the distraction.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.222
[Isabelle] I don't.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.492
You know,
you'd be a lot happier

28:15.494 --> 28:17.594
if you weren't so
freaking repressed.

28:19.031 --> 28:20.230
Alec?

28:21.834 --> 28:23.300
Hello?

28:32.845 --> 28:34.078
[sniffs]

28:35.147 --> 28:36.580
[Simon] What? Come back.

28:36.582 --> 28:38.449
I smell angel blood.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.289
We've been breached.

28:45.290 --> 28:47.057
I don't know how
many there are,
but it's the real thing.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.626
I want them stopped now.
I don't care how.

28:53.599 --> 28:55.632
They're near the
stairwell or in it. Go!

28:58.370 --> 29:00.037
It's all right, darling.

29:00.039 --> 29:02.840
Will you just
stay right there,
just for a minute?

29:03.709 --> 29:04.775
Are you all right?

29:06.045 --> 29:07.277
I'm a little light-hearted.

29:07.279 --> 29:10.047
[chuckles softly]
Light-headed.

29:10.049 --> 29:11.849
Light-hearted
and light-headed.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.552
I guess I had a little
too much to drink.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.321
[laughs] You had?

29:17.923 --> 29:19.923
That's a mind-blower
because...

29:19.925 --> 29:21.825
you had too much
to drink, and I'm...

29:22.728 --> 29:23.827
whatever I am.

29:24.530 --> 29:25.963
You certainly are.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.635
They're in the building.
Stop them.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.743
[Jace] What that vamp did
to you back at the bar...

29:39.745 --> 29:41.211
it's called  <i> encanto.</i>

29:41.213 --> 29:42.730
[flesh searing]

29:42.731 --> 29:44.248
That was just the first step.
[inhales sharply]

29:44.250 --> 29:47.951
It's kind of like what
a cobra does to a mouse
right before it strikes.

29:48.487 --> 29:51.121
This will keep you
safe just in case

29:51.123 --> 29:53.290
you run into
Mr. Fascinating again.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.225
[groans]
Give me your arm.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.593
I'm never gonna live
that down, am I?

29:56.595 --> 29:58.228
Probably not. No.

29:59.498 --> 30:01.098
Ow! What is that?

30:01.100 --> 30:02.666
This is for silence.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.301
The vamps won't
hear us coming,

30:04.302 --> 30:05.935
but we can't disguise the
scent of our blood from them.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.005
[inhales sharply]

30:08.941 --> 30:13.677
Once we enter
the building through there,
they'll know something's up.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.580
But if our plan works,
we'll have time to find Simon.

30:19.018 --> 30:21.785
The mundane world
is all into vampires.

30:21.787 --> 30:26.456
I don't get it.
They see everyone else
as an animated sack of meat.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.592
Yeah, I certainly
don't see the romance.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.728
That's 'cause now
you know it's all real.

30:32.865 --> 30:35.465
Still, you gotta
hand it to them, though.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.568
They know how to
frame a narrative.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.537
How will we find Simon?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.707
He'll be in the most
secure room in the building.

30:44.643 --> 30:47.344
Trust me, we'll know it
when we see it.

30:47.346 --> 30:51.014
What if they do
an  <i> encanto  </i> on him?
Will he turn into a vampire?

30:51.016 --> 30:53.851
No, you have to drink
vampire blood for that.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.152
Even then,
there's more to it.

30:55.154 --> 30:57.387
It's an overly
involved process,
if you ask me.

30:57.389 --> 30:59.790
But I don't get it.
What if a vampire
bites him?

31:00.659 --> 31:02.526
They won't drain
him right away.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.328
They like to
take their time.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.697
Vampires are real gourmets.

31:06.699 --> 31:08.131
He'll be terrified.

31:08.133 --> 31:12.803
Actually,
he'll feel kind of high,
kind of like he's in love.

31:12.805 --> 31:14.304
With the one who bit him?
Yeah.

31:14.306 --> 31:15.739
That's awful.

31:16.342 --> 31:17.407
It's awful?

31:20.012 --> 31:21.245
Guess I wouldn't know.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.080
You've never been bitten?

31:27.887 --> 31:30.087
You've never been in love.

31:33.425 --> 31:36.093
The point is it wears off.
Just like love.

31:37.997 --> 31:40.030
What's the deal with you
and that guy, anyway?

31:40.032 --> 31:41.565
He seems kinda--
Be careful.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.267
Unworthy of you?
How's that?

31:43.736 --> 31:45.702
You really think
you have it all figured out?

31:45.704 --> 31:47.237
I do.

31:47.239 --> 31:48.872
You don't even
understand friendship.

31:48.874 --> 31:50.173
Really?

31:50.175 --> 31:52.442
You have a  <i> parabatai,  </i> right?

31:52.444 --> 31:54.711
Alec would die for me.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.647
Now you understand
me and Simon.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.451
[inhales deeply]
Sun's gonna come up soon.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.657
Remember how to use
the blade?

32:06.658 --> 32:08.225
Keep your arms steady
and don't overestimate
what you know.

32:08.227 --> 32:10.060
They can be tricky.

32:10.062 --> 32:12.629
We'll try and
keep them off you
as much as we can.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.464
Where are Alec and Isabelle?

32:14.466 --> 32:15.933
Being distracting.

32:16.902 --> 32:18.702
You're really not
gonna talk to me,
are you?

32:18.704 --> 32:20.570
That's because
you have no idea
what you're talking about.

32:20.572 --> 32:23.540
But I do. You're hiding
from yourself, not me.

32:23.542 --> 32:26.410
You have feelings,
whether you like
'em or not, Alec.

32:26.412 --> 32:30.280
This is not the time
or the place, Izzy.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.816
I don't know.
Looks pretty smooth so far.

32:46.065 --> 32:47.664
This must be the way.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.500
[growling]

32:51.904 --> 32:53.637
Well, not that smooth.

32:54.606 --> 32:55.639
Any day now.

32:55.641 --> 32:56.940
Yeah, if you hold
the door still,

32:56.942 --> 32:58.508
it might be a lot easier.

32:59.645 --> 33:00.877
It's not taking it.

33:08.120 --> 33:11.121
Whoever said,
"The pen is mightier than
the sword," was an idiot.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.923
When you're right,
you're right.

33:18.263 --> 33:20.497

know where we are?

33:32.978 --> 33:34.244
That's the idea, right?

33:35.781 --> 33:37.147
How long do you think
we have to distract them for?

33:37.149 --> 33:38.315
Ten more minutes.

33:38.317 --> 33:40.283
Ten minutes?
Are you kidding?

33:40.285 --> 33:41.651
We're liquid
lunch in five.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.153
So let's distract them.

33:43.155 --> 33:44.621
So let's distract them.

35:07.739 --> 35:08.972
Damn it! [grunting]

35:12.377 --> 35:13.977
[growling]

35:18.083 --> 35:19.649
Okay.

35:31.130 --> 35:32.395
[grunting]

35:40.672 --> 35:42.172
I killed him.

35:42.941 --> 35:44.007
He was already dead.

35:45.444 --> 35:48.311
Plus, he wanted
to kill you.
Remember that.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.013
She did great, right?

35:51.650 --> 35:54.885
Yeah, you did.
You should be proud.

35:56.922 --> 35:59.189
Thanks, but...
it's not about me.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.324
Let's go find Simon.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.800
Why is it so loud out there?
What is that?

36:10.802 --> 36:12.169
It's nothing, dearest.
A party.

36:12.171 --> 36:14.971
You know the neighbors
in these places.
Short-term rentals.

36:14.973 --> 36:17.541
I know. Bloody Marys
for everyone.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.679
Where is everyone?

36:22.681 --> 36:24.047
Clary! I'm here!

36:24.983 --> 36:27.884
I told you,
you're a hostage!
Accept it!

36:29.154 --> 36:30.954
[laughing]
[Simon breathing heavily]

36:30.956 --> 36:34.090
Don't move.
I know you wanna find out
how this story ends.

36:35.227 --> 36:39.229
Thank you, Raphael.
I'll take care
of this from here.

36:39.231 --> 36:40.363
You don't have to bother.

36:40.365 --> 36:43.500
No, honestly.
I've had it with this thing.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.702
Give it to me.
I'll finish it off.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.903
[Raphael] Camille,
we have a bigger problem.

36:46.905 --> 36:49.039
They're almost here
and you can't be caught.

36:49.041 --> 36:52.475
You're too valuable.
Don't worry, I'll kill it.

36:52.477 --> 36:54.444
That's a little
excessive, yeah?
Shut up.

36:55.147 --> 36:56.980
Take the back passage
out through the tunnels.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.181
Go!

36:58.183 --> 36:59.649
[Simon breathing heavily]

36:59.651 --> 37:05.589
Now you listen and
do exactly as I say...
nothing more.

37:18.170 --> 37:19.769
They're coming.

37:22.674 --> 37:23.873
Simon!
[Jace] Clary!

37:23.875 --> 37:25.375
That's not gonna
do any good.

37:25.377 --> 37:27.377
Listen to him,
Clary Fairchild.

37:27.379 --> 37:28.945
Put it away.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.281
I've had more than enough
of your friend for one day.

37:31.883 --> 37:34.951
I'd love to cut his throat.
Don't give me a reason.

37:35.854 --> 37:36.953
Put it away!

37:39.791 --> 37:42.125
Simon. Simon,
are you all right?

37:42.127 --> 37:43.960
I wouldn't say all right--
Stop talking!

37:45.564 --> 37:48.965
Now... if you would
all just follow me.

37:50.369 --> 37:51.768
Let's go!

37:55.741 --> 37:58.308
Come on, let's go!
Up here now!

38:01.413 --> 38:03.079
That's right,
get down there now!

38:03.081 --> 38:04.581
Get down there or
I'll kill him right now!

38:04.583 --> 38:06.816
Look,
we're not gonna hurt you.
We just want Simon.

38:06.818 --> 38:08.918
I'm glad you do.
We don't!

38:08.920 --> 38:10.587
We wanted you.
Well, here I am.

38:10.589 --> 38:13.256
Stop!
I said "wanted." Not my idea.

38:13.258 --> 38:14.991
Now, get out! Go!
Not without Simon.

38:14.993 --> 38:17.894
Shut up!
Open that door right now
or I'll kill him right here.

38:17.896 --> 38:19.062
Listen to him!

38:19.064 --> 38:20.163
But Simon will die if--

38:20.165 --> 38:21.431
[whimpering]

38:21.433 --> 38:22.666
Clary, go!

38:23.602 --> 38:27.437
[Jace] Go! Go! Go!
[Raphael] Go! Take him! Go!

38:27.439 --> 38:29.272
I don't know
how to thank you.

38:29.274 --> 38:31.107
Don't thank me.
You mean nothing.

38:31.109 --> 38:33.276
This is about Valentine
and the chaos he can bring.

38:33.278 --> 38:35.178
Come on!
Jace Wayland!

38:37.416 --> 38:39.482
[panting] Remember
who your friends are.

38:49.628 --> 38:51.494
[Simon breath trembling]

38:51.496 --> 38:52.829
Shouldn't we get
the hell out of here?

38:52.831 --> 38:54.197
Why, Simon?

38:54.199 --> 38:55.665
They're right downstairs.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.933
Let them come after us.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.669
They'll just turn into
a bunch of fried eggs
out here.

38:59.671 --> 39:00.937
I thought you said
you watch movies.

39:05.043 --> 39:06.209
Oh, my God.

39:06.211 --> 39:09.112
Oh, my God, it's over.
It's actually over.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.648
I was so afraid
I would lose you.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.850
But it's true,
you're actually here.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.785
You know I'd do
anything for you.

39:15.787 --> 39:16.953
You don't have
to die! [sighs]

39:16.955 --> 39:18.121
I'd rather not do that.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.129
I couldn't live
without you.

39:27.799 --> 39:28.865
Say that again.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.301
I couldn't live
without you, Simon.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.037
You're all I have left.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.072
My whole life
just disappeared.

39:36.074 --> 39:39.642
I'm supposed to...
be this other thing,
live this other way.

39:40.712 --> 39:41.878
You're my best friend.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.017
Don't you ever,
ever let yourself

39:48.019 --> 39:49.619
get in that kind
of trouble again.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.455
Got it? Yeah?

39:55.761 --> 39:59.429
<i>♪ You're the one,</i>
<i>You're the one,</i>
<i>You're the one ♪</i>

39:59.431 --> 40:02.599
Well...
no accounting for taste.

40:02.601 --> 40:04.134
Yeah, you should talk.

40:07.239 --> 40:09.239
Look, can I just
say one thing?

40:09.241 --> 40:10.940
You will,
whatever I say, so shoot.

40:10.942 --> 40:14.544
You think you
know Clary, right?
But you may not.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.112
Think about who her father is.
You know what, Alec?

40:16.114 --> 40:18.348
Do not start this
again with me, Alec.

40:18.350 --> 40:20.116
She just came out
of nowhere, Jace.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.251
She has no one.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.019
Just listen to me
for one second--
Alec, stop!

40:26.358 --> 40:27.424
[sighs]

40:30.929 --> 40:32.495
Just stop.

40:33.398 --> 40:34.864
I'm older than you, Jace.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.200
I'm not in your shadow.

40:38.370 --> 40:40.336
If you really feel
that way about her...

40:41.273 --> 40:42.806
why did you help us tonight?

40:53.118 --> 40:56.319
<i>♪ You're the one,</i>
