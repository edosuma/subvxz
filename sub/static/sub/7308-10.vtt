WEBVTT

00:04.396 --> 00:06.273
You sold your sperm?

00:06.482 --> 00:08.609
Stop looking at me like that.
l was a freshman in college.

00:10.194 --> 00:13.823
There are little teenage DiNozzos
running around somewhere?

00:15.533 --> 00:16.617
That's frightening.

00:16.951 --> 00:18.953
l never thought about it
till this morning.

00:19.161 --> 00:20.871
l got a registered letter
from the sperm bank

00:21.080 --> 00:23.749
telling me to contact them
as soon as possible.

00:23.958 --> 00:25.543
- Why?
- l don't know.

00:25.793 --> 00:28.712
<i>- We're moving, DiNozzo.
- Coming out.</i>

00:33.717 --> 00:35.886
<i>- We're on our way down.
- Roger, boss.</i>

00:36.137 --> 00:37.763
<i>- The car's ready.
- Check the exit.</i>

00:38.139 --> 00:39.932
- On it. They're coming down.
- Yes, sir.

00:40.474 --> 00:41.725
Standing by.

00:49.066 --> 00:50.818
- You're making a mistake.
- You made a mistake.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.195
- Back off.
- Stupid, you're making a...

00:53.779 --> 00:55.489
Hey, boss, hold on one second.

00:59.285 --> 01:00.744
What do you got, McGee?

01:01.120 --> 01:02.663
l'm not sure.

01:02.872 --> 01:04.081
l had you...

01:04.290 --> 01:06.167
You're not telling me what to do.

01:06.375 --> 01:07.585
Talk to me, McGee.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.630
Go, go, go.
Get him out of here.

01:11.797 --> 01:14.341
Through the front entrance.
Go, go, go!

02:22.368 --> 02:23.661
- You find a weapon?
- Nope.

02:23.869 --> 02:25.454
Yeah, well, we're done.

02:26.831 --> 02:28.958
Let's bag him and tag him,
Mr. Palmer.

02:29.166 --> 02:30.709
Yes, sir.

02:32.128 --> 02:35.131
Do you think Mr. Ryan
was connected in any way

02:35.339 --> 02:38.259
to the death threat
on the chief of naval operations?

02:38.968 --> 02:40.970
Gonna find out.
lt came from a human rights group

02:41.178 --> 02:43.848
protesting Marine abuse
of prisoners at Gitmo.

02:44.223 --> 02:47.601
lt's ironic, isn't it? A human rights
group threatening to kill.

02:47.852 --> 02:52.273
lt's no different than a right-to-lifer
bombing a family planning clinic, Duck.

02:52.523 --> 02:55.818
Yes, we live
in interesting times, Jethro.

02:56.235 --> 02:58.529
You think, Duck?

02:59.613 --> 03:02.366
Way to go, probie.
Three shots, three hits.

03:02.533 --> 03:05.369
l guess my instruction
on the range paid off, huh?

03:05.953 --> 03:08.289
Tony, l killed somebody, okay?

03:18.799 --> 03:20.050
What about the CNO?

03:20.259 --> 03:22.386
- Secured at home.
- Doubled his security detail.

03:22.595 --> 03:24.722
- Did you find his weapon?
- No.

03:24.930 --> 03:25.931
lt's got to be here.

03:28.309 --> 03:31.228
l identified myself
as a federal officer.

03:32.354 --> 03:34.732
He fired at me. l returned fire.

03:34.982 --> 03:37.526
The SUV drove off.
His weapon has got to be here.

03:38.235 --> 03:41.363
The SUV, McGee. Did you get
the color? Number? Make?

03:41.614 --> 03:44.074
Dark blue or black.

03:44.533 --> 03:46.535
Virginia plate.

03:46.744 --> 03:48.871
First two numbers 89.
l don't know the model.

03:49.079 --> 03:51.582
- Ziva, get out a BOLO.
- On just that?

03:52.666 --> 03:54.752
- Right, BOLO.
- Hang on.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.797
Hey, l wanna know everything
about this guy.

03:59.298 --> 04:01.467
McGee, go back
to where you fired from.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.427
DiNozzo.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.097
Show me, McGee.

04:12.728 --> 04:15.564
Federal officer.
Drop your weapon.

04:17.942 --> 04:18.942
- Got it?
- Got it.

04:24.365 --> 04:27.201
Don't worry, McGee.
l'll find the slug.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.663
Well, we're done.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.125
- This guy's a mess.
- Yeah, you don't know the half of it.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.460
His lungs were completely blackened

04:36.669 --> 04:38.671
from what l would guess
is a two-pack-a-day habit.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.257
His coronary arteries
are almost completely blocked,

04:41.465 --> 04:43.968
and his liver shows
definite sign of abuse.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.806
This little sluggy's in good shape.

04:49.014 --> 04:51.308
l took that out of his thigh.

04:51.517 --> 04:55.646
Didn't impact any bone. lt imbedded
itself in the adductor longus.

04:58.357 --> 05:00.526
- This one's all banged up.
- Yeah, left shoulder.

05:00.734 --> 05:05.489
lt entered the deltopectoral triangle,
smashed the fourth rib,

05:05.698 --> 05:08.701
and ended up
in the upper lobe of his left lung.

05:08.868 --> 05:10.578
Both those were non-lethal.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.873
That one, however,
caused massive damage.

05:17.251 --> 05:19.503
- Abigail.
- Ducky.

05:19.753 --> 05:23.591
You know, there was a time
when you wouldn't set foot in Autopsy.

05:23.799 --> 05:27.052
- Look how far l've come.
- Regrettably, for the moment.

05:27.261 --> 05:30.181
Look, back off.

05:31.474 --> 05:32.933
l think l'm ready
for the next big step.

05:33.601 --> 05:34.810
And what's that?

05:35.770 --> 05:38.856
- Assisting in an autopsy.
- Oh, yeah, right.

05:39.064 --> 05:42.359
Actually, Mr. Palmer,
a medical degree

05:42.568 --> 05:45.821
is not required,
even to be a coroner.

05:46.238 --> 05:49.533
Abby has an exceptional
analytical mind.

05:49.742 --> 05:51.202
She's a quick study.

05:51.410 --> 05:53.996
l think you'll do very well.
Put it on.

05:58.334 --> 06:01.670
Your first lesson,
lesson number one.

06:01.879 --> 06:05.925
The third bullet removed
what was left of the fourth rib,

06:06.091 --> 06:07.885
smashing the costal cartilage,

06:08.093 --> 06:12.765
took a piece out of the left atrium,
and lodged itself

06:12.973 --> 06:15.810
against the costal surface
of the scapula.

06:16.018 --> 06:18.771
lt's amazing how much damage
one bullet can do.

06:19.063 --> 06:21.398
Definitely the kill shot.

06:22.233 --> 06:23.400
Something wrong?

06:28.322 --> 06:31.659
l'm sorry, McGee.
That wasn't meant for your ears.

06:31.867 --> 06:34.036
Not a problem, Ducky.

06:38.457 --> 06:42.378
l was hoping when l woke up
this morning it was all a nightmare.

06:42.586 --> 06:44.421
Somebody needs a hug.

06:49.844 --> 06:52.138
l was trained for last night, but...

06:52.346 --> 06:56.267
Well, shooting a human cutout
is not quite the same, Timothy.

06:56.767 --> 07:00.479
No one is prepared for their first kill.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.527
Abby, l'm gonna need you
to run his prints.

07:06.735 --> 07:08.946
The driver's license was phony.

07:11.449 --> 07:13.492
The only Andrew Aidan Ryan
l could find

07:13.701 --> 07:15.244
is 3 years old
and lives in Los Angeles.

07:15.494 --> 07:17.955
The address, if it existed, would be
in the middle of the Potomac.

07:18.164 --> 07:20.624
- Run his prints.
- Why didn't we think of that, Tony?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.336
Abby's working on it.
FBl's identified three radical groups

07:24.545 --> 07:26.464
protesting prisoner abuse
at Gitmo, boss.

07:26.672 --> 07:28.382
Catch anything with the BOLO,
Officer David?

07:28.632 --> 07:31.635
We did.
Six hundred thousand SUVs.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.473
- That are registered in Virginia.
- Yeah, so?

07:35.681 --> 07:38.976
So we're gonna check them
against radical groups.

07:39.894 --> 07:40.978
Don't--

07:41.187 --> 07:43.147
Something bothering you, Tony?

07:45.024 --> 07:46.901
He doesn't want to say
what we're all thinking.

07:47.109 --> 07:48.319
Spit it out.

07:49.069 --> 07:52.531
McGee says he was shot at,
but we can't seem to find the slug,

07:52.823 --> 07:55.326
shell casing or a weapon.

07:56.494 --> 07:58.204
<i>- Yeah, Gibbs.
- Sir, the director would like</i>

07:58.412 --> 08:00.539
<i>- to see you in her office.
- Be right up.</i>

08:03.250 --> 08:06.962
McGee isn't your father,
and he isn't Ari.

08:07.213 --> 08:09.590
He doesn't know how to lie.

08:13.719 --> 08:14.720
What'd he say?

08:17.264 --> 08:19.391
To go back to work.

08:23.646 --> 08:25.815
Go right in, Special Agent Gibbs.

08:26.816 --> 08:28.275
Shut the door, Jethro.

08:36.700 --> 08:40.203
l'm flashing back
to Paris in '99.

08:46.919 --> 08:50.047
- Not what you're thinking.
- No?

08:50.297 --> 08:51.423
Then what?

08:52.216 --> 08:54.760
l remember you covering
for another agent

08:55.511 --> 08:57.221
who messed up.

08:57.429 --> 09:00.266
- What agent was that?
- You know damn well what agent.

09:00.474 --> 09:02.476
Oh, you mean the time
you shot that guy.

09:02.685 --> 09:04.061
Did McGee blow it?

09:04.228 --> 09:05.396
McGee is a probie.

09:05.771 --> 09:08.607
Probies make mistakes. Having said
that, no, l don't think he did.

09:08.774 --> 09:09.817
Where's the gun?

09:10.025 --> 09:13.988
- The slug that was fired.
- l don't know, but l will find out.

09:14.238 --> 09:17.533
The CNO's aide called me
at 7 a.m. this morning.

09:17.783 --> 09:19.493
Admiral Chapman wants
to know what's going on.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.120
He asked me--

09:23.497 --> 09:24.748
What are you thinking about?

09:25.541 --> 09:26.917
Paris.

09:27.168 --> 09:30.171
Get your mind
out of the bedroom, Jethro.

09:31.797 --> 09:33.424
Let's get some answers.

09:35.176 --> 09:38.012
<i>Your call is very important to us.
Please stay on the line.</i>

09:38.220 --> 09:39.764
<i>We will be with you in a moment.</i>

09:39.972 --> 09:41.766
You've been holding for 1 5 minutes.

09:42.475 --> 09:43.934
Must be important.

09:44.393 --> 09:46.020
Yep.

09:47.271 --> 09:49.106
Sperm bank?

09:53.778 --> 09:56.781
- Yeah.
- Why'd you do it?

09:56.947 --> 09:58.324
You didn't need the money.

09:58.532 --> 10:00.659
lt was easier than giving blood.

10:00.868 --> 10:03.704
You enjoyed making those deposits.

10:07.500 --> 10:10.169
Was there a penalty
for early withdrawal?

10:13.047 --> 10:14.757
You're a sick chick, David.

10:15.090 --> 10:16.801
<i>Thank you for holding.</i>

10:17.051 --> 10:21.680
Hi there. l received
a certified letter requesting l call.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.016
Thanks, Agent Vandalay.
You are the man.

10:24.266 --> 10:26.102
- l owe you one, man.
- Anything useful, DiNozzo?

10:26.310 --> 10:29.730
Of the 621 ,800 SUVs
registered in Virginia,

10:29.939 --> 10:32.608
approximately 1 27,000
of them are dark-colored.

10:33.150 --> 10:34.235
Vanity plates aside,

10:34.443 --> 10:37.321
one in every hundred
begins with the numbers 89.

10:37.530 --> 10:40.658
- That's over 1 ,200 vehicles.
- We're running the registered owners

10:40.866 --> 10:43.828
against the names on the list
of protesters. lt's gonna take a while.

10:47.540 --> 10:48.541
What's wrong?

10:49.375 --> 10:51.502
l ran the fingerprint through AFlS.

10:51.710 --> 10:53.838
The victim's real name
is John Benedict.

10:54.547 --> 10:56.340
Has he got a record?

10:57.049 --> 10:58.843
He was a Metro detective.

10:59.844 --> 11:01.679
He was working undercover.

11:04.723 --> 11:06.684
l killed a cop, boss.

11:16.902 --> 11:18.988
Can l get you two anything?

11:19.280 --> 11:20.322
No, thanks.

11:24.827 --> 11:26.203
Yes, ma'am. l'll send them in.

11:34.920 --> 11:40.926
Special Agents Gibbs and McGee, this
is Metro Police Captain Dan Karzin

11:41.177 --> 11:44.597
and Sergeant Keith Archer,
the dead officer's partner.

11:46.182 --> 11:48.476
- l'm sorry about--
- Director Shepard already gave us

11:48.684 --> 11:52.897
the official NClS condolences,
Special Agent McGee.

11:53.481 --> 11:55.566
We're here to find out
what happened.

11:55.775 --> 11:57.234
Please sit.

12:04.283 --> 12:07.453
l'd like to ask Sergeant Archer
some questions.

12:08.078 --> 12:10.581
Do you know why your partner
was behind the hotel last night?

12:10.790 --> 12:13.876
- No. We were off duty.
- When did you last see him?

12:14.376 --> 12:15.419
Yesterday about noon.

12:15.628 --> 12:17.588
They were working
undercover, Narcotics.

12:17.797 --> 12:20.466
Just got off a 36-hour shift.

12:21.342 --> 12:23.052
l read your report.

12:23.427 --> 12:25.513
l got some questions.

12:26.138 --> 12:28.224
You say you identified yourself?

12:29.975 --> 12:31.769
- Yes, sir.
- Loud enough to be heard?

12:32.228 --> 12:33.270
Definitely.

12:33.479 --> 12:36.857
And you contend that Lieutenant
Benedict then turned and fired at you.

12:37.149 --> 12:38.526
Yes, sir.

12:39.151 --> 12:40.945
So why can't you find
a bullet or a weapon?

12:41.153 --> 12:43.489
- We can't answer that yet.
- Yeah, l can.

12:43.697 --> 12:45.866
Bennie wasn't carrying one.

12:46.909 --> 12:49.870
Are you sure it happened
like that, son?

12:57.253 --> 12:59.421
lt happened the way
that l reported it, captain.

12:59.630 --> 13:02.883
Because l knew Lieutenant John
Benedict maybe 20 years.

13:04.176 --> 13:07.471
He was a highly decorated officer.
A great cop.

13:07.972 --> 13:11.058
And if Agent McGee
had properly identified himself

13:11.225 --> 13:14.645
the way that he claims, there's no way
Bennie would've acted threateningly.

13:14.854 --> 13:16.647
- Evidently he did.
- l don't believe it.

13:16.856 --> 13:19.316
Special Agent McGee,

13:19.650 --> 13:21.485
why don't you return
to the squad room?

13:21.694 --> 13:24.155
We'll call you if we need you.

13:33.873 --> 13:35.875
l'm really sorry.

13:43.215 --> 13:45.009
With all due respect,
Director Shepard,

13:45.217 --> 13:47.052
l think we all know
what happened here.

13:47.261 --> 13:50.014
Nobody else saw another vehicle
in the alley.

13:50.181 --> 13:52.433
A nervous rookie panicked.

13:52.641 --> 13:53.893
Fired prematurely.

13:55.144 --> 13:56.312
Killed a veteran cop.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.898
McGee's young,
but he's a damn good agent.

13:59.106 --> 14:01.692
Are you sure your partner
wasn't carrying a weapon last night?

14:01.942 --> 14:04.487
lt would've blown his cover
on the case that we were working.

14:04.695 --> 14:06.655
You said he was off duty,
just like you are right now.

14:06.906 --> 14:08.073
- Yeah.
- You're carrying.

14:09.909 --> 14:11.869
The small of your back.

14:12.912 --> 14:14.538
Your partner's liver
said he drank a lot.

14:14.789 --> 14:16.749
Oh, go to hell.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.251
- Gentlemen.
- l'm not gonna stand for a cover-up.

14:19.668 --> 14:21.629
And neither am l, captain.

14:21.837 --> 14:25.716
l shared our preliminary report, and
you'll have full access to our findings.

14:25.925 --> 14:27.843
l'm gonna conduct
my own investigation.

14:28.052 --> 14:30.471
- That is your prerogative.
- And l wanna interrogate McGee.

14:30.679 --> 14:31.889
That's not gonna happen.

14:32.098 --> 14:34.767
- l'll handle this, Special Agent Gibbs.
- McGee has made his statement.

14:34.934 --> 14:38.187
- That's not going to change.
- Thank you for coming.

14:38.437 --> 14:41.107
You'll have NClS's full cooperation.

14:41.524 --> 14:44.568
- Do l get to question Agent McGee?
- Yes.

14:45.152 --> 14:46.195
But not today.

14:56.038 --> 14:59.166
Before you jump down my throat,
you think about what you would do

14:59.375 --> 15:03.212
if that cop shot McGee
and McGee didn't have a weapon.

15:06.048 --> 15:08.551
DiNozzo, look at this.
Got a possible.

15:08.801 --> 15:10.511
Robert Gershon.

15:10.719 --> 15:12.888
Thirty-two-year-old white male.
Lives in Alexandria.

15:13.097 --> 15:16.016
Drives a 2003 dark blue
Ford Expedition.

15:16.225 --> 15:19.728
First two digits
of license plates, 89.

15:19.979 --> 15:23.649
McGee, was the SUV
as big as an Expedition?

15:24.442 --> 15:27.111
Maybe. l don't know.
l'm not sure.

15:27.319 --> 15:29.822
This guy belongs to a protest group
called CACA.

15:30.156 --> 15:31.699
You're making that up.

15:31.907 --> 15:33.367
''Citizens Against Criminal Abuse.''

15:33.576 --> 15:36.120
He was arrested last May
for defacing the main entrance

15:36.328 --> 15:38.914
of the Pentagon with horse manure.

15:39.206 --> 15:41.459
Call me crazy, but a guy
that belongs to a group called CACA,

15:41.709 --> 15:43.377
smears horse pucky
on a government building,

15:43.586 --> 15:46.255
- isn't making death threats.
- DiNozzo, David.

15:46.464 --> 15:49.049
Get back in that alley.
Find that damn bullet. Do it now.

15:49.258 --> 15:50.968
Boss, we spent hours.
We covered every inch

15:51.135 --> 15:52.928
of where McGee was standing
when he--

15:53.137 --> 15:55.514
Well, maybe we'll find something
in daylight.

15:55.723 --> 15:57.433
We're working the protester angle.

15:57.641 --> 15:59.685
l don't think that cop being there
had anything

15:59.894 --> 16:01.562
to do with the threat against that CNO.

16:02.021 --> 16:04.774
Can somebody tell me
what the hell is going on here?

16:04.982 --> 16:10.988
First, Abby's lab nerd frames DiNozzo
for murder and then McGee kills a cop.

16:11.197 --> 16:13.949
Did somebody break a mirror?

16:14.158 --> 16:15.451
Boss, can l go
with Tony and Ziva?

16:15.659 --> 16:17.453
- An extra set of eyes might help.
- No.

16:17.661 --> 16:19.705
Metro P.D. is out to get you.
You find the bullet,

16:19.914 --> 16:21.373
it's compromised evidence.

16:21.540 --> 16:22.917
Hey, DiNozzo.

16:23.083 --> 16:26.086
While you're there, see if anyone
saw Benedict in the area last night.

16:26.295 --> 16:27.922
Got it.

16:28.964 --> 16:32.301
- What should l do?
- Find that SUV.

16:34.512 --> 16:36.430
This is a waste of time.

16:36.639 --> 16:39.308
Gibbs says search the alley again,
we search the alley again.

16:39.517 --> 16:42.353
You never question anything
he tells you to do, huh?

16:42.520 --> 16:44.396
- No.
- We can't find anything

16:44.605 --> 16:46.357
because there's nothing to be found.

16:46.565 --> 16:48.109
You don't believe McGee
was shot at?

16:48.317 --> 16:51.278
Tony, McGee stumbled
across something,

16:51.487 --> 16:53.364
misread it and overreacted.

16:53.572 --> 16:56.784
Not McGee.
His brain's like a computer.

16:56.992 --> 17:01.497
lt's scary. l'm sure procedures and
regs warp-sped through his processor

17:01.705 --> 17:03.290
before he pulled the trigger.

17:03.499 --> 17:06.252
lt happens so fast
you don't have time to think.

17:08.045 --> 17:09.046
We're talking about a guy

17:09.255 --> 17:12.340
who has protocols and checklists
for brushing and flossing.

17:14.343 --> 17:17.637
l'll start flashing Benedict's
photo on the street.

17:30.776 --> 17:32.027
Hey.

17:33.154 --> 17:34.155
How are you doing?

17:35.448 --> 17:37.074
Okay.

17:37.658 --> 17:40.077
What's this music?

17:40.786 --> 17:42.496
l'm almost done here.

17:42.788 --> 17:43.998
Tox screen?

17:44.290 --> 17:45.916
Yeah, it's Benedict's.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.586
Ducky said his liver
showed signs of cirrhosis,

17:48.794 --> 17:51.714
but he was clean
and sober last night.

17:52.256 --> 17:54.049
ls that why you called me
down here?

17:54.967 --> 17:57.386
Nope. Come with me, McGee.

17:58.471 --> 18:01.348
- Where are we going?
- Your therapy session.

18:01.557 --> 18:03.267
What?

18:08.439 --> 18:09.482
What is that smell?

18:10.483 --> 18:11.859
Aromatherapy.

18:12.318 --> 18:14.612
You're stressed. Anxious.

18:15.029 --> 18:18.240
Thirty minutes in here,
and you'll be back to your old self.

18:18.657 --> 18:21.327
Probably even better.
Now sit.

18:23.496 --> 18:25.664
l don't believe
in New Age panaceas, Abby.

18:29.585 --> 18:30.711
What are these things?

18:31.712 --> 18:35.132
Frankincense, lavender,
and neroli oil.

18:35.633 --> 18:37.968
What the hell's neroli oil?

18:38.761 --> 18:42.640
''Used for the treatment of depression,
nervous tension, flatulence,

18:42.848 --> 18:44.767
and irritable-bowel syndrome.''

18:44.975 --> 18:47.978
Are you denying that more than one
of those apply to you?

18:48.354 --> 18:49.730
You know what,
l think l'm gonna pass.

18:54.276 --> 18:57.029
- Where did you get these?
- Never leave home without them.

18:58.239 --> 18:59.698
Okay, Abby,
l have to get back to work.

18:59.865 --> 19:03.285
And you will as soon
as you clear your mind.

19:03.494 --> 19:06.664
You'll see things
from a new perspective.

19:06.872 --> 19:09.208
Just relax,

19:09.583 --> 19:13.295
enjoy and inhale.

19:42.825 --> 19:46.871
- You still here?
- No, l'm the director's doppelganger.

19:47.079 --> 19:49.039
l never did know what that meant.

20:08.100 --> 20:10.603
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:11.270 --> 20:13.731
So a doppelganger
is someone who's pissed?

20:13.981 --> 20:15.149
Yes, Agent Gibbs.

20:15.399 --> 20:16.609
- This one definitely is.
- Why?

20:16.817 --> 20:19.570
Why? Because you countermanded
me in front of Metro Police.

20:19.779 --> 20:21.572
l didn't countermand you.

20:21.739 --> 20:23.866
- You overruled me.
- Oh, semantics.

20:25.701 --> 20:29.747
- ls that like doppelganger?
- Get a dictionary.

20:53.187 --> 20:54.480
Open up, McGee.

20:56.315 --> 20:59.527
- Tony, l'm really not in the mood.
- Let me in.

21:06.158 --> 21:07.535
Okay, you're in.
What do you want?

21:08.494 --> 21:09.537
We're going out.

21:10.121 --> 21:11.288
Where?

21:11.622 --> 21:15.042
When the going gets tough,
the tough go clubbing.

21:15.251 --> 21:16.710
We've got to get you dressed.

21:16.877 --> 21:18.879
Tony, l really wanna
be alone tonight, okay?

21:19.755 --> 21:20.756
No, you don't.

21:22.508 --> 21:24.218
Still working on the novel,
l see, huh?

21:24.385 --> 21:27.596
DiNozzo, l'm begging you.
Do not rag on me tonight, okay?

21:27.805 --> 21:29.598
Well, l wouldn't be DiNozzo
if l didn't.

21:30.057 --> 21:31.434
The wardrobe.

21:33.519 --> 21:34.979
You got any party clothes, McGeek?

21:35.187 --> 21:36.981
- Tony--
- Baby, you are not gonna be scoring

21:37.148 --> 21:39.608
- in any of this stuff.
- Hey, would you stop?

21:39.817 --> 21:40.860
l'm not going anywhere.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.581
Hey, listen, man, l'm sorry.
l just wanted to--

21:53.789 --> 21:55.499
No, l know. l know.

21:56.208 --> 21:58.335
l know you're just trying to help.

22:02.506 --> 22:04.759
Tony, l'm not like you guys.

22:06.385 --> 22:08.846
You were trained as a cop.

22:09.430 --> 22:12.016
Gibbs was a Marine sniper.

22:12.892 --> 22:16.270
Kate protected
the president of the United States.

22:17.271 --> 22:20.107
God only knows
what Ziva did with Mossad.

22:21.484 --> 22:26.238
My background is biomedical
engineering and computer forensics.

22:27.907 --> 22:30.409
l don't think l'm cut out
to be a field agent.

22:39.084 --> 22:41.545
The first time l shot at someone...

22:44.757 --> 22:46.300
...l wet my pants.

22:47.468 --> 22:49.178
Really?

22:49.512 --> 22:50.596
Really.

22:53.140 --> 22:56.727
lf you tell anyone that,
l will slap you silly.

23:00.356 --> 23:01.732
You got anything to eat?

23:02.608 --> 23:03.609
l know it's bad.

23:03.859 --> 23:05.569
l've been where you are.
But a week from now,

23:05.778 --> 23:09.615
this will all be behind you.
Just a bad memory.

23:30.511 --> 23:32.054
What time did you get up, Ziva?

23:32.680 --> 23:34.473
Zero four hundred.

23:34.723 --> 23:38.018
Background check on the cop McGee
killed didn't come up with anything.

23:38.227 --> 23:40.521
He drank a little too much,
had three ex-wives...

23:40.729 --> 23:43.482
Yeah, well, that does not make him
a bad person.

23:43.691 --> 23:45.234
His police service record is clean.

23:45.443 --> 23:48.028
Several commendations
for meritorious service

23:48.237 --> 23:50.364
and a mayoral award.

23:50.656 --> 23:51.657
Nothing negative.

23:51.866 --> 23:54.952
Metro's gonna make it look like
our probie killed their hero.

23:56.996 --> 23:58.956
They're going to interrogate McGee
this afternoon.

24:01.167 --> 24:03.544
Request was approved
by the director.

24:03.794 --> 24:06.172
And you know this how?

24:06.797 --> 24:10.509
l'm a spy, remember?

24:13.554 --> 24:14.805
When were you gonna tell me?

24:15.014 --> 24:17.057
l see we're picking up
where we left off yesterday.

24:17.266 --> 24:19.518
lf you're sending McGee to Metro,
you're damn right we are.

24:19.727 --> 24:21.979
Didn't know l had to ask
your permission.

24:22.855 --> 24:24.398
Don't give me the stare.

24:24.607 --> 24:26.901
- l'm not a junior agent.
- No, you're a junior director.

24:27.109 --> 24:29.528
That's enough, Special Agent Gibbs.

24:29.737 --> 24:32.323
<i>Excuse me, director.
They're waiting for you in MTAC.</i>

24:32.865 --> 24:34.325
l'm on my way, Cynthia.

24:34.533 --> 24:36.243
You have to learn how to say no.

24:36.452 --> 24:38.496
l did, Jethro.

24:39.205 --> 24:41.290
Or have you forgotten?

24:51.717 --> 24:54.720
McGee, what are you
doing here so early?

24:55.262 --> 24:58.349
l had an epiphany.
A different way of tracking the SUV.

24:59.391 --> 25:00.851
So the aromatherapy worked.

25:01.060 --> 25:03.562
lt cleared your mind so you could
come up with new ideas.

25:03.771 --> 25:06.440
- l don't know about that.
- l do.

25:07.733 --> 25:09.443
Did you get any sleep last night?

25:09.610 --> 25:11.695
Not much.
DiNozzo kept me up till 3.

25:11.862 --> 25:12.863
Our DiNozzo?

25:13.072 --> 25:15.574
He came by my apartment
to cheer me up.

25:15.783 --> 25:17.409
- Really?
- Yeah, l know.

25:17.618 --> 25:20.371
DiNozzo being nice to me
means l'm really in trouble.

25:21.288 --> 25:24.625
l think it's sweet.
So, what was your light bulb?

25:24.834 --> 25:27.711
Well, are you familiar with
the Ajzen-Fishbein Theory

25:27.920 --> 25:30.214
- of reasoned action?
- Of course.

25:30.464 --> 25:33.843
lf Lieutenant Benedict was having
an argument with the man in the SUV,

25:34.093 --> 25:37.596
the theory hypothesizes there's a high
probability they had prior contact.

25:38.055 --> 25:42.560
So you're matching SUV owners
to people Benedict knew?

25:42.810 --> 25:45.396
- Exactly.
- Using what as a database?

25:45.604 --> 25:50.401
l wrote this program to cross-check
registered owners with telephone calls

25:50.609 --> 25:53.863
and e-mails sent and received
by Benedict over the last three months.

25:54.071 --> 25:57.658
Timothy, that's brilliant.

25:57.867 --> 26:00.077
l thought so,
but l didn't get any hits.

26:00.286 --> 26:03.038
Problem is l only got
his home and cell numbers.

26:03.205 --> 26:05.416
l was denied access
to Benedict's extension at Metro.

26:05.666 --> 26:07.042
lf you had the maintenance codes

26:07.251 --> 26:09.503
for the telephone servers
at the police department,

26:09.753 --> 26:10.921
do you think that would help?

26:11.714 --> 26:13.174
Yes.

26:13.340 --> 26:15.676
While you're getting me
a Caf-Pow! , l'll make a phone call.

26:19.013 --> 26:21.348
ls there any way of finding out
why she wants to talk to me?

26:21.557 --> 26:24.101
<i>Not without asking her.
Are you a personal friend of hers?</i>

26:24.310 --> 26:26.103
<i>- l was a donor.
- l'm sorry. l can't hear you.</i>

26:26.437 --> 26:28.731
<i>- l'm a donor.
- Oh, a donor, right.</i>

26:28.939 --> 26:31.108
<i>- What was your last name again?
- DiNozzo.</i>

26:31.317 --> 26:34.612
- Could you spell that for me, please?
- Big D, little l, big N, little ozzo.

26:34.820 --> 26:36.113
<i>- And your first name?
- Anthony.</i>

26:36.322 --> 26:38.991
<i>Would you please hold a moment,
Mr. DiNozzo?</i>

26:42.578 --> 26:44.997
Playing phone-tag
with the sperm bank.

26:45.456 --> 26:47.458
You haven't found out
what it's about yet?

26:48.000 --> 26:49.376
Well...

26:49.752 --> 26:54.131
They're probably running low
on their favorite fossil fuel,

26:54.381 --> 26:55.633
''Essence of DiNozzo.''

26:57.927 --> 26:59.637
<i>- Hello, sir?
- Yeah, l'm here.</i>

26:59.845 --> 27:01.639
<i>She's in a meeting at the moment.
Out of the office.</i>

27:01.847 --> 27:03.641
<i>- When will she be back?
- Not till tomorrow.</i>

27:03.808 --> 27:05.559
<i>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</i>

27:06.060 --> 27:07.353
Problem?

27:09.522 --> 27:12.566
The woman who's been trying
to contact me isn't there.

27:12.775 --> 27:14.652
Her title is director of critical issues.

27:15.027 --> 27:17.446
What do you think that means?

27:19.115 --> 27:21.492
l don't know, but it sounds serious.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.494
Yeah.

27:24.870 --> 27:28.040
lt could be one of my offspring
has a medical condition.

27:28.249 --> 27:31.085
Maybe they need
an organ transplant.

27:33.879 --> 27:38.843
You-- You, who won't share
a Krispy Kreme doughnut.

27:39.051 --> 27:41.095
You are going to give up a kidney?

27:47.226 --> 27:49.687
You wouldn't understand.
You're not a parent.

28:00.906 --> 28:02.450
That's so cute.

28:02.616 --> 28:04.201
l didn't know you were superstitious.

28:05.161 --> 28:06.287
l'm not.

28:07.872 --> 28:08.956
We've got a hit.

28:10.749 --> 28:14.587
Edward Francis Halligan.
Owns a black 2005 Range Rover.

28:14.795 --> 28:16.922
License plate 8967YZE.

28:17.131 --> 28:20.050
He received a call from Benedict's
Metro office extension two weeks ago.

28:20.301 --> 28:21.761
You wanna know how McGee
figured it out?

28:21.927 --> 28:23.471
- No.
- Halligan's an lrish national.

28:23.637 --> 28:25.723
He's been living here
for the past three years.

28:26.182 --> 28:27.558
l'll run him by my lnterpol contacts.

28:27.808 --> 28:31.020
- Find him, Tony, bring him in here.
- On it.

28:34.273 --> 28:37.109
So...
Are you gonna bust them, Archer?

28:37.276 --> 28:39.069
Blow my cover.
Why don't you?

28:39.278 --> 28:41.197
They don't look Navy.

28:41.739 --> 28:42.740
Who are you staking out?

28:42.948 --> 28:45.117
A second-tier pusher
released from Elkton this morning.

28:45.326 --> 28:48.162
Right now he's in that hotel
reacquainting himself with his old lady.

28:48.370 --> 28:51.207
Historically, the pusher's second stop
is to look for employment,

28:51.373 --> 28:53.334
so l'm hoping he'll lead me
to a local distributor.

28:53.584 --> 28:55.336
l'm surprised you agreed to meet.

28:55.544 --> 28:57.004
Just wanna find out the truth.

28:57.171 --> 29:00.174
l'd appreciate it if Captain Karzin
didn't find out we were talking.

29:00.382 --> 29:02.301
He's not going to hear
anything from me.

29:03.135 --> 29:04.136
Do you know this guy?

29:06.388 --> 29:08.432
Never met him, but l'd love
to get my hands on him.

29:08.641 --> 29:09.683
lt's Ed Halligan.

29:09.892 --> 29:12.770
He's a rich lrishman rumored to be
the money behind a local crack ring.

29:12.978 --> 29:14.105
He drives a black SUV.

29:14.522 --> 29:16.524
He collects expensive cars.
He has dozens of them.

29:16.732 --> 29:18.442
Why'd Benedict call him
two weeks ago?

29:18.651 --> 29:20.486
We set a trap for Halligan,
but he never showed.

29:20.820 --> 29:22.113
Bennie suspected he was tipped.

29:24.490 --> 29:25.950
Wait, what are you
getting at, Gibbs?

29:26.742 --> 29:29.954
We think that Halligan was the guy
your partner was talking to in the alley.

29:30.204 --> 29:33.958
- lf he was, he had a legitimate reason.
- Wouldn't he have told you?

29:34.208 --> 29:35.292
Look, l'm...

29:36.043 --> 29:37.878
l was the junior partner on the team.

29:38.087 --> 29:40.923
We hadn't been together that long,
so he didn't share everything with me.

29:41.882 --> 29:43.968
lf you think that he was
a dirty cop, forget it.

29:44.176 --> 29:45.636
Bennie was as straight up
as they come.

29:45.845 --> 29:47.972
You just said
you hadn't been together very long.

29:48.180 --> 29:50.850
How long does it take
to know if your partner's dirty?

29:55.688 --> 29:59.275
- ls that your dirt bag?
- Yeah, l gotta get to work.

30:00.067 --> 30:01.610
Okay.

30:13.456 --> 30:14.498
Anxious?

30:15.040 --> 30:16.417
Does it show?

30:16.584 --> 30:18.502
May l give you some advice?

30:18.711 --> 30:19.712
Please.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.381
Be confident when Metro
interrogates you.

30:22.590 --> 30:25.342
lf you don't believe what you're saying,
how can they?

30:25.885 --> 30:27.595
Every time l think about it,

30:28.387 --> 30:29.764
it comes out a little different.

30:31.015 --> 30:33.684
For God's sakes,
don't tell that to Metro.

30:33.893 --> 30:35.519
Where's the boss?

30:35.770 --> 30:39.565
- Where's Halligan?
- Not at home. l went to his house.

30:39.982 --> 30:43.194
lt's really more like an estate.
lt's all marble and stone.

30:43.402 --> 30:46.405
Monolithic thing
with Greco-Roman statues.

30:46.614 --> 30:47.990
lmpressionist art and flowers
everywhere.

30:48.157 --> 30:51.410
ln the front hall, there were these two
flowers like swans that were kissing.

30:51.619 --> 30:53.537
What about the Range Rover?

30:53.746 --> 30:57.041
Oh, that wasn't in the garage,
but the thing was loaded.

30:57.249 --> 31:00.711
<i>Lamborghinis, Ferraris,
1 965 Aston Martin, the Goldfinger--</i>

31:00.920 --> 31:02.630
Tony.

31:03.422 --> 31:04.799
Sorry.

31:05.257 --> 31:06.258
Sorry.

31:06.467 --> 31:08.719
Reminded me of when l was a kid
in the Hamptons.

31:09.303 --> 31:10.888
So you have no idea where he went?

31:11.430 --> 31:14.266
Well, he told Shamus,
that's his houseboy,

31:14.433 --> 31:15.726
he was going away for a few days.

31:15.935 --> 31:18.104
l'm telling you, if l had
a master bedroom like that,

31:18.312 --> 31:19.355
mirrors on the ceiling...

31:19.563 --> 31:22.483
My contact at lnterpol said Halligan's
been under investigation

31:22.691 --> 31:24.777
in lreland, Britain and France.

31:25.820 --> 31:29.323
Several indictments.
All drug related, but none ever--

31:33.619 --> 31:36.205
- Whatever that is doesn't sound good.
- Halligan's on the goat.

31:36.413 --> 31:37.498
Oh, no. Not goat.

31:38.874 --> 31:40.251
Sheep?

31:40.501 --> 31:42.670
- Lam?
- That's it.

31:42.920 --> 31:45.673
He's on the lam.
There's no B in that, by the way.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.550
Thank you.

31:47.758 --> 31:50.052
He bought a ticket
at Dulles yesterday afternoon.

31:50.261 --> 31:53.180
- To lreland?
- Rabat, Morocco via Lisbon.

31:53.556 --> 31:55.349
No extradition.

31:57.893 --> 31:59.186
Benedict was arresting him.

32:01.814 --> 32:04.108
l killed a cop arresting a drug lord.

32:08.904 --> 32:10.281
His goose is cooked.

32:11.615 --> 32:13.492
You would get that one right.

32:33.721 --> 32:36.932
Bennie didn't point
a weapon at you...

32:37.683 --> 32:39.226
...did he?

32:52.072 --> 32:53.657
No.

33:01.957 --> 33:04.460
- ls the director in?
- Expecting you.

33:07.171 --> 33:08.172
Close the door, please.

33:08.380 --> 33:10.674
No, you don't want
that door closed, director.

33:10.883 --> 33:12.968
- l don't?
- No.

33:17.723 --> 33:20.142
- Let her rip.
- The U.S. Attorney's office

33:20.351 --> 33:22.186
is charging McGee
with negligent homicide.

33:22.394 --> 33:24.897
Metro is booking him right now.
Do you know why?

33:25.106 --> 33:26.816
Because he admitted
to making a tragic mistake.

33:27.066 --> 33:30.111
No, because you may know
how to kiss ass,

33:30.319 --> 33:32.113
but you sure don't know
how to protect it.

33:32.279 --> 33:34.740
And you think you're protecting
that boy by ignoring the facts?

33:34.949 --> 33:37.284
He's not a boy.
He's an NClS special agent.

33:37.493 --> 33:40.037
He's one of my people.
l don't leave my people behind.

33:40.246 --> 33:42.790
- lt's a Marine thing.
- What are you going to do?

33:43.082 --> 33:45.251
l'm gonna go to Metro
and get him.

33:45.501 --> 33:47.420
- No.
- No?

33:47.670 --> 33:50.881
Your eyesight's weak,
not your hearing.

33:57.430 --> 34:00.641
You're not going to Metro
because McGee's on his way here.

34:00.891 --> 34:04.103
l convinced Captain Karzin
that he wasn't a flight risk

34:04.311 --> 34:08.565
and to release him into our custody
until his arraignment hearing.

34:17.824 --> 34:20.578
- You should have gone with him.
- Why me? He's your bud.

34:20.744 --> 34:24.456
- Bud?
- Bud. Buddy. Friend.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.293
You're not McGee's friend?

34:27.835 --> 34:29.670
Of course l'm his friend.

34:29.920 --> 34:33.174
English is
a very confusing language.

34:33.382 --> 34:34.675
lf you're his--

34:38.094 --> 34:41.724
- There's that word again.
- lnterpol missed Halligan in Portugal.

34:41.931 --> 34:44.935
He cleared Mora Customs
an hour ago.

34:52.318 --> 34:53.860
l let you down.

34:54.487 --> 34:58.073
- l think it's the other way around.
- l should have gone with you to Metro.

35:00.159 --> 35:02.411
l don't think
it would have made a difference.

35:04.888 --> 35:06.098
l panicked.

35:06.557 --> 35:09.059
l thought he had a weapon in his hand.
l need to face it.

35:09.560 --> 35:11.311
l shot a good cop making an arrest.

35:11.520 --> 35:14.398
What cop makes a drug bust
without a weapon?

35:15.524 --> 35:16.608
None.

35:16.817 --> 35:18.569
Rule number eight is gonna
save you, McGee.

35:19.278 --> 35:20.571
Never date a coworker?

35:20.821 --> 35:22.364
Never go anywhere
without your knife.

35:22.531 --> 35:25.075
- l thought that was nine.
- Never take anything for granted.

35:25.284 --> 35:27.119
<i>Correcto, jefe,
but you did make up the rules--</i>

35:27.327 --> 35:29.788
- Get to the point, Abs.
- l didn't do forensics on the jacket

35:29.997 --> 35:31.457
because we knew what happened.

35:31.707 --> 35:34.293
<i>Then l remembered
rule numero ocho.</i>

35:34.501 --> 35:35.878
Gunshot residue.

35:36.128 --> 35:39.214
Based on the density and the pattern
of the stippling and the sooting,

35:39.381 --> 35:44.928
one of the slugs in Lieutenant Benedict
was fired from only one foot away.

35:45.429 --> 35:48.432
- One of my shots missed?
- l knew you weren't that good, probie.

35:48.599 --> 35:50.851
Three for three at 25 meters?
l don't think so.

35:51.059 --> 35:52.603
Halligan shot him
from behind the wheel.

35:52.770 --> 35:54.021
Wrong, boss.

35:54.396 --> 35:56.023
Slap him, Ziva.

35:58.275 --> 36:01.904
lf Halligan was behind the wheel,
then he was five or six feet away.

36:02.112 --> 36:03.989
l pulled the registration
from the Range Rover.

36:04.573 --> 36:06.700
lt was brought in the DMV
for an inspection

36:06.909 --> 36:09.495
because it was imported
from lreland.

36:11.705 --> 36:13.081
Right-hand drive.

36:13.290 --> 36:16.210
British, like Ducky's Morgan. Steering
wheel's on the right-hand side.

36:16.376 --> 36:18.670
The person l saw arguing
with Benedict was a passenger.

36:18.879 --> 36:20.756
- There was a third man.
- That's a great movie.

36:20.964 --> 36:23.634
- Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles.
- We're looking in the wrong direction.

36:23.842 --> 36:25.803
lf McGee's third round
didn't hit the SUV,

36:26.011 --> 36:29.473
then it's somewhere at the other end
of that alley. Go. Abby, thank you.

36:32.226 --> 36:33.936
Boss, he still didn't fire at me.

36:34.144 --> 36:36.355
You saw a flash, McGee.
You heard a gunshot.

36:36.730 --> 36:39.566
You had no way of knowing
if Benedict was firing at you or not.

36:40.609 --> 36:43.362
lf l was in your position, McGee,
l'd have fired.

36:43.862 --> 36:45.405
Go on.

36:45.697 --> 36:47.866
Run Halligan's phone records.
See if you can't figure out

36:48.075 --> 36:50.911
- who he was meeting with.
- Right.

36:52.496 --> 36:55.249
Could be your two rounds
weren't the fatal one.

37:03.006 --> 37:06.510
lf you ever Gibbs-slap me again, David,
and l will slap you back harder.

37:06.718 --> 37:09.638
- l was following orders.
- The dutiful Mossad agent.

37:11.932 --> 37:14.017
You miss the spy game?
Must have been exciting.

37:14.268 --> 37:16.520
You've seen too many
James Bond movies.

37:16.728 --> 37:20.774
- lt's not all about car chases and sex.
- lt wasn't?

37:21.525 --> 37:24.445
Well, there was a lot of sex.

37:30.617 --> 37:33.162
Six-one-four. Ohio.

37:33.745 --> 37:35.122
Sperm bank.

37:35.330 --> 37:36.957
Yeah, this is Anthony DiNozzo.

37:37.124 --> 37:38.876
<i>There's something l need
to talk to you about.</i>

37:39.334 --> 37:41.044
<i>- Yeah?
- Your sperm is being discharged.</i>

37:41.503 --> 37:43.964
Yeah, l know. There's gotta be
some kind of mistake because--

37:44.173 --> 37:47.217
<i>- Yeah, that's me. But, l mean--
- Were you hoping for birth notification?</i>

37:47.468 --> 37:48.469
No.

37:48.677 --> 37:50.304
<i>- Well, have a nice day.
- Thank you.</i>

37:50.512 --> 37:52.306
<i>You're welcome.</i>

37:52.806 --> 37:54.516
Do you want to discuss it?

37:55.142 --> 37:56.143
lt's nothing.

37:56.351 --> 37:58.812
For two days, you've obsessed
on that letter, driving me crazy.

37:59.021 --> 38:01.523
- Now, all of a sudden, it's nothing?
- Drop it.

38:01.774 --> 38:04.818
l understand.
l'd be embarrassed too.

38:06.820 --> 38:10.240
l shouldn't have done it, but your
phone kept on ringing this morning,

38:10.449 --> 38:13.952
and l knew this call was important,
so l answered it.

38:15.078 --> 38:16.205
You talked--?

38:16.413 --> 38:19.500
To the woman at the sperm bank,
the director of critical issues.

38:19.708 --> 38:20.959
Yes.

38:23.003 --> 38:25.339
l'm sorry, Tony.

38:28.509 --> 38:31.720
She had no right to tell you
that no one wants my sperm.

38:32.763 --> 38:34.223
Yes.

38:36.475 --> 38:41.355
- You didn't talk to her.
- So no little DiNozzos anywhere.

38:41.647 --> 38:44.316
lt's hard to believe that a stud like you
would not be chosen.

38:44.525 --> 38:48.737
Were any of the prospective women
shown a photo of you? Because...

38:50.405 --> 38:53.158
You're enjoying this a lot,
aren't you?

38:53.325 --> 38:55.744
Oh, yes.

38:59.456 --> 39:04.211
- Are they going to return your sperm?
- Let's focus on finding the bullet.

39:05.671 --> 39:07.047
Don't have to.

39:14.263 --> 39:16.431
The striations in the bullets
are exact.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.517
lt was definitely fired
from McGee's SlG.

39:18.725 --> 39:21.728
- Where did you two find the bullet?
- Miss Abby Sciuto.

39:23.939 --> 39:24.940
Right here, boss.

39:25.149 --> 39:28.861
Behind the body,
embedded in the door frame.

39:29.069 --> 39:31.321
McGee was wide to the left.

39:31.530 --> 39:33.574
Where the hell
is Benedict's weapon?

39:35.993 --> 39:38.078
- Yeah?
- l have a theory.

39:38.287 --> 39:39.913
Okay.

39:40.122 --> 39:43.250
McGee identified himself.

39:43.459 --> 39:46.420
The man in the car fires point blank
at Benedict.

39:46.628 --> 39:49.131
Now, like you said,
it was too close and it was dark.

39:49.381 --> 39:51.967
So McGee couldn't distinguish
where the flash came from,

39:52.468 --> 39:55.512
and McGee fires back.

39:55.762 --> 39:57.306
One missed.

39:57.514 --> 39:59.057
And when Benedict fell,

39:59.641 --> 40:03.312
he dropped his weapon through
the open window of the Range Rover.

40:03.729 --> 40:06.023
- What do you think?
- What's going on?

40:06.231 --> 40:08.609
- We're saving your butt.
- Hey, come on. What do you got?

40:08.817 --> 40:10.611
lt's a dump of Halligan's
phone records.

40:10.819 --> 40:13.655
The morning of the shooting, he
placed several calls to Archer's home

40:13.822 --> 40:15.657
- and cell phones.
- You mean Benedict's?

40:16.116 --> 40:17.117
No, Archer, his partner.

40:17.326 --> 40:19.995
The call from Metro two weeks ago
came from Archer, not Benedict.

40:20.245 --> 40:21.955
Partners share extensions
at the precinct.

40:22.122 --> 40:25.292
l showed Archer a picture of Halligan.
He acted like they'd never met.

40:25.501 --> 40:27.252
Well, one of the phone calls
lasted 1 8 minutes.

40:29.254 --> 40:31.590
Come on, McGee.
You're with me.

40:33.342 --> 40:34.551
McGee, come here.

40:35.052 --> 40:37.262
Use my backup.

40:42.976 --> 40:44.895
Archer's gotta know
that Halligan's in Morocco.

40:45.104 --> 40:47.523
- He's never gonna talk.
- ls Halligan in Morocco?

40:47.731 --> 40:49.274
Ziva said he passed through Customs.

40:49.441 --> 40:52.778
Well, maybe Archer doesn't know that.
Pull an old warrant.

41:08.544 --> 41:09.795
What's up?

41:10.003 --> 41:11.171
Got a few questions.

41:12.214 --> 41:14.508
- He's supposed to be in custody.
- He's in my custody.

41:14.716 --> 41:16.510
You never told me
you spoke with Halligan.

41:16.760 --> 41:18.220
- Never did.
- Phone records show

41:18.428 --> 41:20.556
you exchanged several calls.

41:20.806 --> 41:22.850
You know what, l don't care
what your phone records say.

41:23.058 --> 41:25.394
l never talked to Halligan.
You can ask him.

41:25.602 --> 41:28.689
One of the calls was two weeks ago,
the time you claim you set the trap.

41:28.897 --> 41:31.358
l don't need this from the guy
who killed my partner.

41:31.567 --> 41:34.778
McGee shot him after someone
inside the car fired first.

41:35.028 --> 41:37.364
Your partner suspected
you were working with Halligan.

41:37.614 --> 41:39.908
He followed you to a meet in the alley.

41:40.784 --> 41:42.327
You guys aren't laying this off on me.

41:42.536 --> 41:45.205
We pulled a nine-millimetre slug
out of Benedict's chest.

41:45.414 --> 41:47.583
l wanna run that
against your service weapon.

41:49.126 --> 41:51.587
We're gonna search the premises.

41:52.004 --> 41:53.380
l'm not talking
to Navy-wannabe cops.

41:53.589 --> 41:56.133
lnterpol picked Halligan up
in Lisbon.

41:56.341 --> 41:57.968
He never made it to Morocco.

41:58.302 --> 42:00.429
We'll get him back here
and he'll talk.

42:00.929 --> 42:03.182
Halligan's not gonna take the fall
for you.

42:20.783 --> 42:23.619
Don't ever hesitate because you
second-guessed yourself again.

42:23.786 --> 42:25.162
l'll take your badge.

42:25.370 --> 42:27.623
- Are we clear?
- Clear.

42:43.096 --> 42:46.558
l thought you would be out celebrating.

42:48.727 --> 42:49.853
No.

42:54.900 --> 42:56.819
Did you come down for a hug?

42:59.571 --> 43:00.781
What'd you find out?

43:03.242 --> 43:05.994
l ran every test l could think of.

43:06.620 --> 43:08.705
The slugs are too damaged.

43:08.956 --> 43:11.625
There's no way to tell
who fired the kill shot.

43:15.671 --> 43:18.048
Does it really matter?

43:19.341 --> 43:20.968
Yeah.

43:22.886 --> 43:24.638
lt matters.
