01:13.391 --> 01:14.526
So how was your day, Mikey?

01:14.958 --> 01:16.827
I was down by the old factory.

01:17.161 --> 01:18.563
What were you doing
down by the factory?

01:18.797 --> 01:20.432
Tommy and Vinny.

01:20.465 --> 01:22.232
Yeah, you know I don't like ya
hanging around those two.

01:22.467 --> 01:24.436
- You always come back a mess.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:24.669 --> 01:26.970
Yeah, well I'm serious, Mikey.

01:33.378 --> 01:36.080
I don't want you playing around
the factory. It's dangerous.

01:39.216 --> 01:41.553
It's okay, it's okay, come here.

01:43.688 --> 01:46.223
I want you
to have something Mikey, okay?

01:46.458 --> 01:49.361
Something that's
very dear to my heart.

01:50.428 --> 01:53.897
My mother gave this to me
when I was just a little girl.

01:54.131 --> 01:55.533
You've seen me with it, right?

01:55.767 --> 01:57.268
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:57.502 --> 02:01.339
She said that
if I was ever lost or scared

02:01.573 --> 02:03.308
that this would
lead me back home.

02:04.007 --> 02:06.176
And now, I want you to have it.

02:07.044 --> 02:07.911
Okay?

02:14.686 --> 02:17.389
So I want you to promise me
that if you ever feel alone

02:17.756 --> 02:20.258
that you're just going
to take out this compass

02:20.492 --> 02:23.994
and know that
I'm always with you, okay?

02:24.962 --> 02:26.063
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:26.297 --> 02:27.432
All right.
I love you. Come here.

02:27.665 --> 02:29.199
I love you, too.

Hey you.
Hey, beautiful.

Ummmm...

02:59.731 --> 03:00.698
'Course I did.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.933
So what are we doing tonight?

03:03.167 --> 03:05.002
I don't know.
I gotta talk to the guys.

03:05.370 --> 03:06.471
The guys?

03:06.504 --> 03:07.672
I swear.
It's like you're all married.

03:07.906 --> 03:09.307
We are all married.

03:09.541 --> 03:11.041
We're gonna get a big house,

03:11.074 --> 03:12.510
we're gonna have a bunch
of wives, a bunch of kids.

03:12.744 --> 03:13.645
Ha ha.

03:14.279 --> 03:18.349
Okay.

03:18.383 --> 03:20.017
Just be ready for tonight, okay?

03:20.652 --> 03:22.420
I gotta go right now
though, I'm sorry, baby.

03:22.754 --> 03:24.656
Why?
I'm late, I gotta go meet-

03:24.889 --> 03:26.624
The guys, I know.

03:28.158 --> 03:30.762
You're the best.

03:30.795 --> 03:32.363
- I love you.
- I love you too.

03:49.481 --> 03:50.615
Oh, here he is.

03:50.648 --> 03:52.383
Hey Mikey,
where the hell you been?

03:52.617 --> 03:53.685
Hey guys.
Hey.

03:53.718 --> 03:55.587
What the hell

03:55.854 --> 03:57.120
Hello, Mickey.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.356
- Good, how you doing?
- I'm all right.

03:58.389 --> 03:59.691
He was in the car giving
her a little one, two.

04:00.758 --> 04:02.293
Where were you?

04:02.327 --> 04:05.497
I was, uh, I was busy...
doing something important.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.398
He was taking care
of some business.

04:07.432 --> 04:08.433
Taking care
of some business. What's...

04:08.700 --> 04:10.067
What's the lucky guy?

04:10.100 --> 04:12.102
Better stop going out
with guys on dates.

04:12.337 --> 04:13.705
You guys want the usual?

04:14.071 --> 04:16.139
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Yeah, yeah, that's good.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.175
What about you, Vinny?

04:18.208 --> 04:20.209
You're looking a little
glum today, sweetie.

04:20.812 --> 04:23.113
Yeah, what's wrong with him?
I'll have the same.

04:23.448 --> 04:25.350
Thank you.

04:25.383 --> 04:27.117
I'll be right back
with your order.

04:27.452 --> 04:29.754
Thank you.

04:29.787 --> 04:32.022
Look at this guy.
Behave yourself.

04:32.590 --> 04:34.024
Forget about it.

04:35.360 --> 04:38.463
I think, uh...

04:38.496 --> 04:40.097
I think I'm gonna pop
the question tonight.

04:40.331 --> 04:41.733
Whoa!
Whoa.

04:41.766 --> 04:43.301
This guy.
You're gonna pop the quest-really?

04:43.535 --> 04:45.837
Yeah.
Congratulations, Mickey.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.472
Thank you.
Yes, congratulations.

04:47.705 --> 04:49.039
- God bless you.
- on your death.

04:49.274 --> 04:51.409
God bless you and her, yeah.

04:51.643 --> 04:52.677
Thank you.

04:52.710 --> 04:53.711
What the hell's
the matter with you?

04:53.745 --> 04:54.812
Yeah, you gonna
see Susan tonight?

04:54.846 --> 04:56.347
Hey, Vinny, snap out of it!

04:57.615 --> 04:59.082
See that look?
You gotta watch out for that.

04:59.317 --> 05:00.351
Oh, what, is he gonna kiss me?

05:00.585 --> 05:01.719
Maybe.

05:01.753 --> 05:03.086
But Susan, Susan?

05:03.321 --> 05:04.455
Yeah, I'm seeing her tonight.

05:04.856 --> 05:06.324
And?

05:06.357 --> 05:07.825
I don't know.
We just haven't, um...

05:08.158 --> 05:09.761
What? Speak up, speak up.

05:09.994 --> 05:11.228
This guy-

05:11.262 --> 05:12.363
- Guys, guys.
- You know, you know...

05:12.597 --> 05:13.364
spit it out, Vinny.

05:13.598 --> 05:15.266
We haven't,

05:15.300 --> 05:16.568
yeah, we haven't...
Come on, give it to me.

05:16.801 --> 05:17.769
Come on, give it up.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.537
Do me a favor, keep it down.

05:19.571 --> 05:20.738
I'm learning so much
about you, Vincent.

05:21.339 --> 05:23.140
I've never seen it before.

05:23.173 --> 05:24.642
Didn't I tell you that?
Have you ever touched it?

05:25.075 --> 05:26.811
- I've touched it, yes.
- Have you ever seen the thing?

05:27.345 --> 05:29.747
You're lying to me. You have
never even touched a pussy.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.784
No, I-I've seen...
I've seen glimpses of it.

05:33.116 --> 05:35.853
I knew it, I knew it.
Remember I told you,

05:36.086 --> 05:37.555
Hey! Hey!

05:37.822 --> 05:39.357
- No, don't. Don't.
- What?!

05:39.390 --> 05:40.825
- don't, don't, don't...
- We gotta tell you something.

05:41.059 --> 05:42.627
Honey, can't you see
I'm working here?

05:42.994 --> 05:45.797
This guy here,
can you believe it?

05:45.830 --> 05:47.832
He's been with this girl
for God knows how long

05:48.165 --> 05:50.501
and he's a virgin.
He hasn't sealed the deal.

05:51.936 --> 05:52.837
I want to tell you, sweetheart,

05:53.071 --> 05:54.439
you look really nice today.

05:54.772 --> 05:55.840
Thanks, honey.

05:55.873 --> 05:57.575
Aw, virgins are
kinda cute to me.

05:58.241 --> 06:00.345
Oh, really?

06:00.378 --> 06:02.179
Well then you are in luck
'cause we have one right here.

06:05.248 --> 06:07.585
If, uh, things don't work
out with yous...

06:08.019 --> 06:11.255
you can always date me, doll.
Just let me know, capiche?

06:15.326 --> 06:17.795
I think our friend Vincent over
here just went in his pants.

06:26.537 --> 06:27.739
What's the hell's
the matter with you?

06:27.972 --> 06:29.474
It's got nothing
to do with her, man.

06:29.707 --> 06:31.542
You'll take care
of business tonight, Vinny.

06:31.776 --> 06:33.711
Eventually some girl
is gonna wanna sleep with you.

06:34.045 --> 06:36.347
- Yeah, don't worry.
- It's not that, guys.

06:36.581 --> 06:37.849
It's not that,
what is it?

06:37.882 --> 06:39.617
Your mother didn't make you
pancakes this morning.

06:40.418 --> 06:41.919
Why you always gotta be
picking on me?

06:42.219 --> 06:43.721
Can I tell you
something serious for once?

06:43.955 --> 06:45.590
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:45.957 --> 06:47.692
- Buck up!
- I'm getting drafted!

06:47.725 --> 06:49.727
All right, you want
to hear that?

06:50.061 --> 06:51.796
I got drafted this morning.

06:53.264 --> 06:53.931
- What?
- What?

06:56.300 --> 06:57.502
I got drafted today.

06:59.337 --> 07:01.906

07:01.939 --> 07:03.908
What the fuck do you

07:05.743 --> 07:06.678
Are you serious?

07:07.745 --> 07:09.414
I'm being serious with this.

07:10.948 --> 07:12.383
I got this in the mail
this morning.

07:17.555 --> 07:19.290
What am I gonna
tell my mom, man?

07:20.091 --> 07:22.894
- You haven't told anyone yet?
- I don't know how to.

07:23.127 --> 07:26.196
All right, just, we'll think
of something here, all right?

07:26.497 --> 07:28.198
Mikey, this is not a fuckin'
suggestion! This is a-

07:28.433 --> 07:30.268
This is a draft card,
you understand me?!

07:30.468 --> 07:32.235
They're not asking me,
they're telling me!

07:32.603 --> 07:33.805
We're gonna think of
something, all right?

07:34.038 --> 07:35.339
We're gonna think of something.

07:35.573 --> 07:37.475
What are you gonna think about?

07:37.508 --> 07:39.610
Listen guys,
I just wanted to tell you,

07:39.877 --> 07:43.347
you know, like thank you, you
know and I'll miss you guys.

07:43.581 --> 07:45.248
Listen, stop talking
like that, all right?

07:45.483 --> 07:46.684
Listen, we grew up together.
All right?

07:46.918 --> 07:48.319
We're like family.

07:48.352 --> 07:49.587
Yeah, don't talk
like that any more.

07:50.054 --> 07:51.589
Listen, think, think, think.

07:51.622 --> 07:53.257
We're gonna figure
something out here, all right?

07:53.791 --> 07:55.326
What am I gonna do, Mickey?

07:56.561 --> 07:58.463
Huh, what am I gonna do?

07:58.696 --> 08:00.698
This is not me, man,
this is not me.

08:01.299 --> 08:02.800
We could put you in a car and
we'll sneak you

08:02.834 --> 08:04.936
across the borde.
I will drive you to Canada.

08:05.570 --> 08:07.939
- You could hide out.
- Who wants to go to Canada?

08:09.474 --> 08:10.508
I'm going with you.

08:16.013 --> 08:16.948
Mickey.

08:17.782 --> 08:19.317
Mickey. I love you...

08:19.350 --> 08:21.552
you're like a brother to
me but you got a life here.

08:21.953 --> 08:23.020
You know I ain't got
nuthin', man,

08:23.254 --> 08:24.522
and you got a life here.

08:24.822 --> 08:26.290
Vinny, no, listen,

08:26.324 --> 08:26.991
we grew up together, we're
like family, all right?

08:27.225 --> 08:28.626
You're like my brother

08:28.926 --> 08:30.328
and you're not going there
on your own.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.537
Are you-you'd do that for me?

08:40.938 --> 08:42.607
Who's gonna watch
your back, huh?

08:42.840 --> 08:44.075
Are you serious right now?

08:44.107 --> 08:45.476
You kidding?
We're going together?

08:45.810 --> 08:47.011
We're going together, huh?

08:51.582 --> 08:52.950
What are you lookin' at me for?

08:57.388 --> 08:58.756
All right, forget about it,
I'll come too.

08:59.090 --> 09:00.458
What?

09:00.491 --> 09:01.592
You need somebody to
take care of your ass.

09:03.227 --> 09:05.730
You come too? No, you're not-

09:07.098 --> 09:08.866
You're gonna have your
head so far up his ass,

09:09.100 --> 09:10.434
you'll need someone to
watch out for you

09:10.668 --> 09:11.869
and I'll shoot them little gooks

09:12.236 --> 09:13.638
when you guys are doing nothing.

09:14.705 --> 09:15.773
You know he wouldn't do it.

09:16.007 --> 09:17.074
I'd end up shooting
you in the ass

09:17.608 --> 09:19.443
And I'd shoot you just because.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.815
Just make sure I'm not with
Becky when you do it, huh?

09:25.583 --> 09:27.718
Hey, God bless you, Mickey.

09:47.171 --> 09:48.372
What's up?

09:50.408 --> 09:52.476
- I love you.
- I love you too.

09:53.678 --> 09:54.545
So much.

09:55.112 --> 10:01.853
I do too.

10:01.886 --> 10:03.688
You know I want to be
with you, right?

10:03.921 --> 10:05.990
Yeah, I want to be
with you too.

10:08.993 --> 10:10.361
I want to be with you,

10:14.065 --> 10:17.134
be with you.

10:17.168 --> 10:19.003
I-I've never felt
like this before.

10:20.638 --> 10:22.540
- Me neither.
- Not with anyone.

10:24.709 --> 10:25.710
I love you.

10:34.719 --> 10:36.520
I have to tell you something.

10:36.988 --> 10:42.860
What?

10:42.894 --> 10:44.528
Vinny got a draft card today.

10:45.563 --> 10:47.498
- He did?
- Yeah, he did.

10:48.933 --> 10:50.101
He's going into the war.

10:51.502 --> 10:52.670
- That's awful.
- Yeah.

10:55.606 --> 10:57.208
Yeah.

10:57.241 --> 10:58.910
He must be really
upset about it.

10:58.943 --> 11:01.479
Yeah, I mean can you
imagine Vinny in the war?

11:01.812 --> 11:04.515
I think I'm the one that taught
him to tie his shoelaces.

11:04.849 --> 11:06.617
His shoelaces are
always untied.

11:07.985 --> 11:09.120
The kid's a mess.

11:09.354 --> 11:10.554
I know, he is.

11:20.231 --> 11:21.899
I told him I was going with him.

11:24.602 --> 11:26.237
Why?

11:26.271 --> 11:29.941
Because he's my brother.
He's my family, and I... I...

11:30.875 --> 11:32.643
I can't risk losing him.

11:32.677 --> 11:35.012
Can you imagine him out there
in the middle of the war?

11:35.246 --> 11:36.113
I mean, like, he-

11:37.048 --> 11:38.849
- Why would you go?

11:38.883 --> 11:42.486
I'm... I'll be there to...
I'm like his brother. I'll-

11:42.820 --> 11:44.088
I'm gonna take care
of him out there.

11:44.323 --> 11:45.856
- Tommy's coming too.
- No.

11:45.890 --> 11:47.525
We're gonna look after
each other. And we're gonna...

11:47.558 --> 11:49.160
We're gonna take care of
each other out there, so...

11:49.394 --> 11:50.528
What about me?

11:50.761 --> 11:53.064
You can't just leave like that.

11:53.298 --> 11:55.700
I know, I know,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.203
I didn't-I wasn't planning on
this, this just happened.

11:59.438 --> 12:01.772
You promised we would spend
the whole summer together.

12:02.006 --> 12:03.941
Baby, I promise-
We have some time.

12:04.175 --> 12:05.609
We're gonna spend a lot
of time together but-

12:05.843 --> 12:08.579
- I want to spend time
after the summer together.

12:08.913 --> 12:12.650
I do too, I really
do. I don't want to go.

12:12.883 --> 12:15.720
- Baby, I don't want to go.
- I don't want to be here.

12:15.953 --> 12:16.921
I want you to take me home.

12:17.154 --> 12:18.122
Mary, listen to me.

12:18.357 --> 12:20.157
No, no, I want to go home.

12:21.293 --> 12:22.793
- I want to go home.
- Listen to me.

12:23.027 --> 12:24.595
- I'm sorry, Mary, I have to go.
- No.

12:24.829 --> 12:26.230
- No, you don't.
- I have to.

12:26.264 --> 12:27.598
- No, you don't. You can stay here with me.
- Yes, I do.

12:27.631 --> 12:29.133
- I have to go, Mary!
- No, you don't.

12:29.334 --> 12:32.003
Yes, I do! I can't
leave him there!

12:32.236 --> 12:34.171
I can't leave him
by himself there!

12:34.538 --> 12:37.041
Tommy's coming! We're gonna
look after each other.

12:37.775 --> 12:39.277
What about me?

12:39.677 --> 12:41.912
What am I to you?!

12:41.946 --> 12:44.181
I love you so much.
You are everything to me.

12:44.949 --> 12:47.585
I love you too, and
that's why you should stay.

12:47.818 --> 12:49.587
I don't want to go, Mary.

12:49.820 --> 12:51.989
I don't want to go
but I have to.

12:52.491 --> 12:54.692
You understand?
Do you understand that?

12:54.925 --> 12:57.795
He's my family. He's my
brother, and I have to go.

12:58.662 --> 13:00.231
I don't want you to go.

13:04.535 --> 13:10.174
I promise you that it's all
gonna work out somehow, okay?

13:11.208 --> 13:13.010
Everything's gonna
work out, okay?

13:13.378 --> 13:15.012
I believe you.

13:15.646 --> 13:17.081
Everything's gonna be fine.

13:20.385 --> 13:22.119
I want to be with you forever.

13:23.355 --> 13:24.722
I do too.

13:25.689 --> 13:26.690
You do?

13:27.024 --> 13:27.691
Yeah.

13:28.125 --> 13:37.635
I do.

13:37.668 --> 13:39.304
<i>Back before you know it.
Blink of an eye.</i>

13:39.837 --> 13:41.906
<i>Pick up right
where we left off.</i>

13:44.642 --> 13:48.079
<i>To a ticker tape parade,
and a hero's welcome.</i>

15:02.019 --> 15:03.355
- Yes.
- Yeah?

15:03.588 --> 15:04.422
Yes.

15:06.790 --> 15:08.192
Yes?
Yes.

15:08.426 --> 15:09.894
Yes?!

16:22.267 --> 16:24.868
<i>Five hundred and forty nine
thousand soldiers</i>

16:25.102 --> 16:27.305
<i>served in Vietnam
in the year 1969.</i>

16:29.507 --> 16:31.942
<i>Five hundred and forty nine
thousand goodbyes.</i>

16:34.279 --> 16:36.213
- Mickey.
- Hey, let's go!

16:37.081 --> 16:38.882
Hey, Mikey, let's go!

16:39.284 --> 16:42.953
That's my cue.

16:42.987 --> 16:47.024
<i>Five hundred and forty nine
thousand promises to come home.</i>

17:04.509 --> 17:06.175
Hey, come on, asshole.

17:06.511 --> 17:08.779
We gotta get goin'. You all rig?

17:09.113 --> 17:11.516
Mary, we'll see you later, huh?

17:12.483 --> 17:14.885
Hey, what do you want, a
fuckin' parade? Get in the car.

17:15.118 --> 17:16.920
We'll have him back to you
in no time, all right?

17:17.154 --> 17:18.021
Hey!

17:19.324 --> 17:20.190
Bye.

17:25.194 --> 17:27.865
Look at this guy.

17:27.897 --> 17:29.800
Don't worry, we'll make sure
we tuck him in at night.

17:30.034 --> 17:31.802
- Mary, we'll see you soon.
- Yeah.

17:32.036 --> 17:34.306
See you in a bit. We'll have
him back before no time.

17:34.773 --> 17:36.907
They'll probably kick
us out for being ugly.

17:42.946 --> 17:44.549
<i>The thing about luck is...</i>

17:46.116 --> 17:51.021
<i>you don't know you had it,
until after it's gone.</i>

17:56.361 --> 17:58.596
All right, here we go, boys.

17:59.331 --> 18:00.432
Here we go, boys.

18:00.465 --> 18:02.232
Thanks so much
for coming with me, guys.

18:02.467 --> 18:04.436
I told you before, if I
get shot while I'm over there,

18:04.669 --> 18:07.372
- I'm gonna fucking kill you.
- Thank you so much, Mickey.

18:29.761 --> 18:31.496
<i>And so it went on.</i>

18:32.364 --> 18:34.098
<i>We made our plans.</i>

18:34.566 --> 18:36.301
<i>Vinny got laid.</i>

18:36.835 --> 18:38.570
<i>Tommy was still an asshole.</i>

18:40.438 --> 18:44.041
<i>And just like a bunch of
ready-made tin toy soldiers...</i>

18:44.709 --> 18:48.380
<i>we were processed
and shipped out.</i>

18:49.179 --> 18:53.183
<i>And the war would be just
an adventurous interlude</i>

18:53.984 --> 18:59.990
<i>a brief chapter in our
long fortunate lives.</i>

19:38.028 --> 19:39.531
Hey, how come you ain't eating?

19:43.535 --> 19:44.935
'Cause I ain't hungry.

19:45.303 --> 19:46.571
Here, have some of mine.

19:50.575 --> 19:52.042
You're like my mother
sometimes, you know that?

19:52.410 --> 19:53.278
Yeah?

19:54.178 --> 19:55.413
Who else is gonna let you know

19:55.447 --> 19:57.582
which end of that rifle's
the dangerous one?

20:00.418 --> 20:01.619
That one, right?

20:01.853 --> 20:02.720
Yeah.

20:11.362 --> 20:13.230
Hey, how's Mary doing?

20:14.399 --> 20:15.999
You heard from her?

20:18.135 --> 20:19.471
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

20:19.838 --> 20:22.105
- She's good.
- Yeah?

20:23.608 --> 20:25.142
She's pregnant.

20:26.444 --> 20:28.646
- No.
- Yeah, yeah.

20:30.180 --> 20:31.716
- No.
- Yeah.

20:31.982 --> 20:34.352
You're gonna be a daddy?
You're gonna be a daddy?

20:34.652 --> 20:38.055
You're gonna be a daddy?
Look at you. All grown up.

20:38.590 --> 20:41.259
- Can you believe that?
- Congratulations, Mickey.

20:41.493 --> 20:42.660
I'm gonna be a father.

20:45.162 --> 20:46.431
I'm gonna be a father!

20:47.565 --> 20:49.166
I'm so sorry, Mickey.

20:51.503 --> 20:53.170
Damn, I'm so sorry.

20:53.538 --> 20:54.572
What are you talking about?

20:54.806 --> 20:56.641
I got you
in this shithole, man.

20:57.542 --> 21:01.144
You and Tommy, you shouldn't
be here, this was my fight.

21:03.213 --> 21:05.517
I just want you to know
that you should

21:05.750 --> 21:09.621
be at home with your wife,
meet your kid, you know?

21:11.723 --> 21:13.424
Nah man, we're in this together.

21:14.792 --> 21:17.060
I just hope we make
it out all right, man.

21:26.437 --> 21:28.373
<i>In the middle of
the bloodiest time of the war,</i>

21:28.940 --> 21:31.074
<i>we saw too many of us fall.</i>

21:33.444 --> 21:35.413
<i>We were looking
for the big fight</i>

21:36.381 --> 21:37.715
<i>the highest kills</i>

21:38.215 --> 21:39.751
<i>but the VC knew it.</i>

21:40.351 --> 21:42.253
<i>Their platoons stayed small,</i>

21:42.754 --> 21:44.187
<i>moved constantly,</i>

21:44.622 --> 21:46.257
<i>used our own signals
against us,</i>

21:46.925 --> 21:49.159
<i>ambushed us,
then disappeared.</i>

21:50.562 --> 21:52.463
<i>But if we did
catch up to them,</i>

21:53.364 --> 21:55.165
<i>we had a score to settle.</i>

21:56.133 --> 21:57.702
<i>And we were fucking pissed.</i>

21:58.036 --> 21:59.270
Holy shit...

21:59.504 --> 22:00.371
Vin!

22:18.823 --> 22:20.458
Look what we got here, fellas.

22:28.700 --> 22:29.601
Go ahead.

22:30.335 --> 22:31.201
Pull it.

22:32.202 --> 22:33.338
Pull the fucking thing.

22:38.241 --> 22:39.109
Pull it!

22:40.612 --> 22:41.746
Pull it, motherfucker.

22:43.213 --> 22:48.386
Pull it.

22:48.419 --> 22:50.722
Looks like we got ourselves
here a quitter, guys.

22:54.459 --> 22:57.562
- Hold this.
- Baptize his ass, Squiggs?

23:00.264 --> 23:02.266
You know what we do
to quitters, huh?

23:11.843 --> 23:14.412
Yeah! Baptize that
motherfucker! Go ahead!

23:15.880 --> 23:18.248
Oh yeah,
how you like that, huh?

23:21.886 --> 23:23.721
<i>When people ask me
about the war,</i>

23:25.723 --> 23:27.558
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

23:28.092 --> 23:30.160
Go ahead!
Earn your stripes, baby!

23:30.695 --> 23:33.431
Yeah! Get it in his mouth!
Get it in his fuckin' mouth!

23:33.665 --> 23:35.266
Yeah, you motherfucka.

23:35.633 --> 23:37.468
<i>I could tell them
about the VC.</i>

23:38.770 --> 23:41.339
<i>I could say how you lose
your humanity.</i>

23:41.639 --> 23:42.607
How you like that?

23:42.840 --> 23:44.542
<i>How I witnessed it firsthand.</i>

23:45.677 --> 23:47.210
<i>How it still haunts me today.</i>

23:47.445 --> 23:48.579
It burns, right? It burns!

23:48.813 --> 23:49.947
<i>How we did our duty.</i>

23:50.247 --> 23:51.582
<i>Served our country.</i>

23:52.617 --> 23:54.318
<i>Honored our last brothers.</i>

23:54.552 --> 23:56.821
- Squiggs, Squiggs, come on, man-
- Shut the fuck up!

23:57.955 --> 23:59.424
<i>But did we really?</i>

24:00.625 --> 24:01.726
<i>I don't know.</i>

24:02.360 --> 24:03.661
Fuckin' earn your stripes!

24:04.062 --> 24:06.229
What the fuck
is goin' on here?

24:07.665 --> 24:09.867
<i>But I do know</i>

24:09.901 --> 24:11.402
<i>that anybody
that wasn't there</i>

24:12.870 --> 24:14.405
<i>would never understand it.</i>

24:18.676 --> 24:20.978
- Get the fuck out.
- Yes, sir.

25:29.947 --> 25:31.883
Tommy!

25:34.619 --> 25:35.486
Tommy!

25:37.855 --> 25:39.557
Cover me while I move!

25:40.057 --> 25:40.925
Moving!

25:41.926 --> 25:43.795
Don't go, Mickey! Mickey!

25:45.129 --> 25:46.464
Don't do it!

25:46.697 --> 25:49.467
Tommy!

26:01.546 --> 26:02.380
Medic!

26:04.749 --> 26:05.616
Tommy!

26:06.450 --> 26:07.318
Medic!

26:08.486 --> 26:09.353
Medic!

26:13.791 --> 26:14.659
Medic!

26:17.094 --> 26:18.429
Let me see it.

26:20.064 --> 26:22.066
- Please...
- Medic!

26:22.366 --> 26:23.901
Medic!

26:25.503 --> 26:26.938
Medic!

26:27.805 --> 26:28.739
Tommy!

26:29.073 --> 26:30.107
Tommy!

26:31.609 --> 26:33.845
- Echo Three, this is-
- Blackbird!

26:34.145 --> 26:35.847
Blackbird, do you read me?!

26:36.080 --> 26:37.448
We need air support now!

26:37.982 --> 26:40.818
We need help!
Where the fuck are you?!

26:41.419 --> 26:43.120
76 Bravo,
this is 24...

26:43.354 --> 26:45.022
I need a medi-vac here!

26:45.257 --> 26:47.091
We need air support now!
We got men down!

26:47.358 --> 26:49.126
Do you copy?!

26:49.160 --> 26:50.528
You're gonna
be all right, all right?

26:50.828 --> 26:52.096
Don't fuckin' lie to me.

26:53.865 --> 26:55.566
You're lookin' good,
all right? It's nothing.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.802
It's like the time you fell off
the porch. Remember that?

26:58.903 --> 26:59.904
Stay with me, okay?

27:00.137 --> 27:01.405
Stay with me! Stay with me!

27:01.772 --> 27:02.940
Looking good,
all right, buddy?

27:02.974 --> 27:04.709
- I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die!

27:04.942 --> 27:06.410
Stay with me,
stay with me, okay?

27:06.644 --> 27:08.145
Fuckin' Joe DiMaggio, right?

27:08.379 --> 27:10.681
Here, here, here, all right?

27:12.183 --> 27:14.919
I fuckin' hate Joe DiMaggio.

27:15.254 --> 27:18.055
Come on,
we gotta go!

27:23.661 --> 27:28.866
Sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

27:29.334 --> 27:30.935
Hang in there, okay buddy?

27:30.968 --> 27:32.904
You're lookin' good.
Lookin' good. Stay with me.

27:33.137 --> 27:35.606
Look at me! Look at me! Look
at me! Stay with me, okay?

27:35.840 --> 27:37.441
Stay with me! Stay with me!

27:37.675 --> 27:39.176
I fuckin' hate
Joe DiMaggio too, man.

27:39.410 --> 27:41.579
Let's go,
move out, move out!

27:41.812 --> 27:43.681
We gotta move out!
We gotta get him outta here!

27:43.915 --> 27:45.516
Come on, let's go, let's go!

27:46.751 --> 27:47.685
Let's move!

27:52.857 --> 27:53.791
Get him up!

27:57.128 --> 27:59.630
<i>That was the last time
I ever saw Tommy.</i>

28:03.100 --> 28:05.603
<i>I knew every expression
he ever made.</i>

28:06.737 --> 28:08.773
<i>But after that day,</i>

28:08.806 --> 28:11.442
<i>I could never get that look
on his face out of my head.</i>

28:14.078 --> 28:15.813
<i>I told the guys
in my platoon,</i>

28:16.781 --> 28:18.816
<i>"I don't know
if he made it to Heaven,"</i>

28:19.284 --> 28:21.085
<i>"but if Tommy ever
saw the Devil,"</i>

28:21.485 --> 28:23.487
<i>"he'd look him right
in the face"</i>

28:23.754 --> 28:25.156
<i>"and he'd tell him,
'Go fuck yourself.'"</i>

28:26.924 --> 28:29.527
<i>They nodded, and laughed</i>

28:30.227 --> 28:31.896
<i>and toasted to my friend.</i>

28:32.563 --> 28:35.599
<i>Of course, that false bravado
came from fear.</i>

28:36.567 --> 28:39.503
<i>A fear that grew inside each
and every one of us.</i>

28:40.405 --> 28:42.673
<i>Something we'd never be able
to say out loud.</i>

28:43.641 --> 28:46.177
<i>Never be able to name
or put a face to.</i>

28:47.545 --> 28:48.813
<i>But there it was.</i>

28:50.548 --> 28:52.083
<i>And it never went away.</i>

29:58.015 --> 29:59.884
<i>There was no
hero's welcome for us.</i>

30:01.752 --> 30:03.621
<i>There were protests
in the street.</i>

30:06.123 --> 30:07.992
<i>We served our country.</i>

30:08.592 --> 30:10.661
<i>And they hated us for it.</i>

30:12.930 --> 30:14.799
<i>The Vietnam War was over
for me now.</i>

30:16.801 --> 30:18.636
<i>But another battle
had just begun.</i>

30:20.338 --> 30:22.206
<i>Who needs
a damn parade anyway.</i>

30:29.580 --> 30:33.050
You remember the men
who fell before you in W W Two.

30:33.285 --> 30:34.952
A real war, I might add.

30:35.886 --> 30:39.824
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- You like your job, De-puke-o?

30:40.492 --> 30:43.994
It's DeLucca, sir,
Michael DeLucca.

30:44.862 --> 30:46.797
I could give a rat's ass.

30:48.333 --> 30:49.867
The answer is

30:50.335 --> 30:51.202
no,

30:51.802 --> 30:53.771
you do not like your job.

30:54.605 --> 30:58.042
It's people like me who
made this country strong.

30:58.276 --> 31:01.078
The men who stand up,
who make a difference.

31:01.313 --> 31:03.948
And I certainly
don't wanna lose it all

31:04.181 --> 31:10.054
to no lazy fuckin' alcoholic
pathetic goomba piece of shit!

31:11.323 --> 31:12.823
Excuse my French.

31:14.326 --> 31:17.061
Like yourself.

31:17.094 --> 31:20.764
Excuse me, sir, but I
fought for this country.

31:20.998 --> 31:22.733
I'm cuttin' your hours!

31:23.568 --> 31:25.836
- No, sir, wait-
- Get the hell outta my sight!

31:26.237 --> 31:27.738
I need those hours!

31:36.448 --> 31:38.682
- Yo Rocky, what's up, buddy?
- Hey, where you been?!

31:38.916 --> 31:40.684
Tony, what did I tell you, man?

31:40.718 --> 31:42.853
You don't even gotta say it
but you're welcome, brother!

31:43.087 --> 31:44.755
Fuck you, you prick!

31:53.164 --> 31:54.865
Yo, what's up? How was work?

31:59.437 --> 32:00.639
What's the matter with you?

32:04.442 --> 32:06.043
Marty cut my hours.

32:06.278 --> 32:08.413
Piece of shit.

32:08.446 --> 32:10.748
- You're telling me.
- You know what you need to do, right?

32:10.981 --> 32:12.783
The next time Marty calls
you into his office,

32:13.017 --> 32:14.386
you wait until that motherfucker

32:14.419 --> 32:16.687
starts giving you one of them,
how do you call those?

32:17.021 --> 32:19.957
- I built America.
- I built America. That's it. That's the one.

32:20.191 --> 32:22.693
Well right when he's done,
you get up

32:22.960 --> 32:25.162
and say "Thank you very
much," pull your pants down

32:25.397 --> 32:27.164
and tell him to kiss your
ass and walk the fuck out.

32:27.399 --> 32:29.066
- Yeah?
- Do it.

32:30.234 --> 32:31.835
Yeah, thanks
for the tip, Danny.

32:32.102 --> 32:35.105
Hey, if it were me, I'd take
a shit on his fuckin' desk,

32:35.440 --> 32:41.111
but hey...
I just work here, right?

32:41.145 --> 32:42.347
- I'm getting fucking evicted.
- I don't know how much longer

32:43.548 --> 32:46.884
I can take this
low paying shit, Danny.

32:49.019 --> 32:50.488
I can't do it anymore.

32:55.092 --> 32:56.227
You take it easy.

32:56.461 --> 32:57.995
My man, stay tight!

33:04.068 --> 33:10.040
Yo Mikey!

33:10.074 --> 33:11.409
What are you doing later, eh?

33:12.377 --> 33:14.245
I don't know, why?

33:26.890 --> 33:29.860
Jesus, Danny,
I have a question for you.

33:30.094 --> 33:33.130
You heard of an AC?
'Cause this shit ain't working.

33:33.365 --> 33:36.468
It is fuckin' hotter in
here than it is outside.

33:39.970 --> 33:42.340
Sorry bro, been
meaning to get that fixed.

33:42.574 --> 33:43.441
Shit.

33:48.613 --> 33:51.982
All right, so this is for
real, this is the place?

33:53.418 --> 33:54.918
So what kinda work
you do in there?

33:55.152 --> 33:58.155
Simple shit, you know,
plumbing, electrical.

33:58.390 --> 34:01.058
Whatever that prick needs,
he calls me. Nothing more.

34:01.393 --> 34:05.029
Pays me shit.

34:05.062 --> 34:07.798
If you want out, now's
the time. You know that, right?

34:09.367 --> 34:10.234
Yeah, I know that.

34:11.536 --> 34:13.103
Good.

34:13.137 --> 34:16.072
'Cause you're about to be a
fuckin' rich motherfucker!

34:18.074 --> 34:20.110
- Rich motherfucker.
- That's right!

34:20.378 --> 34:22.112
Rich motherfucker.

34:24.482 --> 34:26.384
So how are we planning
on doing that?

34:29.119 --> 34:30.120
There's a safe.

34:45.603 --> 34:47.137
Greedy motherfucker
barely pays me

34:47.371 --> 34:49.005
but he's sitting
on a shitload of cash.

34:49.407 --> 34:51.875
- Yeah, how do you know that?
- I hear things.

34:52.610 --> 34:55.313
So where is it?

34:55.347 --> 34:57.282
Hand me that Allen
wrench over there, will you?

34:58.350 --> 34:59.249
Tell you the truth,

35:00.552 --> 35:01.453
I ain't quite sure.

35:01.686 --> 35:03.120
What?!

35:03.153 --> 35:04.556
What do you mean you
ain't quite fucking sure?!

35:04.589 --> 35:06.257
- Hey, lower your goddamn voice.
- Danny, I swear to God...

35:06.291 --> 35:08.660
if you're gettin' yourself in
one of these fucking cockamamie-

35:08.693 --> 35:10.628
It's here. It's here, all right?

35:11.962 --> 35:13.130
Where?!

35:13.163 --> 35:14.898
Behind one of them paintings
or some shit.

35:16.133 --> 35:18.068
Saw them hide it once.
What?!

35:18.303 --> 35:19.604
Not sure where really.

35:21.038 --> 35:23.475
Why? Why would they do that?

35:23.842 --> 35:25.610
They live upstairs.

35:27.177 --> 35:28.613
What's so fucking funny, Danny?

35:28.879 --> 35:32.216
Jesus, you're really aiming
for the fence with this one.

35:32.617 --> 35:34.652
Tell me about it.
Guess they figured

35:34.885 --> 35:38.122
it'd be a safe place to hide it.
Beats the fuck outta me.

35:38.956 --> 35:41.526
Old fuckin' bastard didn't
trust me either, I guess.

35:41.760 --> 35:43.160
Yeah, I wonder why.

35:43.395 --> 35:44.462
Smart ass.

35:46.964 --> 35:48.433
There you are, you bastard.

35:49.267 --> 35:51.969
Freeze your fuckin' balls
off now, motherfucker!

35:55.239 --> 35:56.641
We just have to find it, Mikey.

35:57.007 --> 35:58.309
It's as easy as that.

36:14.459 --> 36:15.959
Hey, don't think so much.

36:16.193 --> 36:18.195
You'll give yourself a
fuckin' aneurism, come on.

36:36.180 --> 36:41.151
Hey, neighbor.

36:41.185 --> 36:44.689
Hey. What's with you always
showing up out of nowhere?

36:45.022 --> 36:47.659
Sometimes it's good to be
invisible to assholes, right?

36:48.693 --> 36:50.194
I wouldn't know, Houdini.

36:51.296 --> 36:52.229
Where ya headed?

36:52.597 --> 36:54.632
Drown my sorrows. Wanna come?

36:56.200 --> 36:57.134
I got a better idea.

36:57.569 --> 36:59.203
Not likely.

36:59.236 --> 37:01.739
- Meet me at Pauley's at 8.
- Pauley's, isn't that, uh...

37:01.972 --> 37:03.106
I hate delis!

37:03.341 --> 37:04.174
Tough shit!

38:16.481 --> 38:20.485
I like to come out here.
Think about things.

38:26.558 --> 38:28.125
Every time I close my eyes,

38:30.261 --> 38:31.128
I remember.

38:33.130 --> 38:36.199
Every time I wake up at night,

38:37.001 --> 38:39.337
I walk the streets,
I take the bus,

38:39.704 --> 38:41.739
I talk to people, I
shake hands.

38:42.774 --> 38:43.675
I remember.

38:48.479 --> 38:49.814
I need a change, Jane.

38:51.616 --> 38:53.518
I need to get out
of this fucking town.

38:55.253 --> 38:56.854
If I left, would you
come with me?

38:58.356 --> 39:00.358
Michael, we
don't have to run away.

39:00.792 --> 39:02.293
You can make a change here.

39:04.462 --> 39:05.330
You're right.

39:06.364 --> 39:08.466
I can.

39:08.499 --> 39:11.302
And tomorrow night,
everything is gonna change.

39:12.537 --> 39:13.871
Yeah, how's that?

39:16.574 --> 39:17.442
I got a break.

39:18.776 --> 39:20.110
What kind of break?

39:22.347 --> 39:23.213
A new job.

39:24.649 --> 39:26.116
Oh really, where?

39:27.919 --> 39:30.622
- At a... art gallery.
- Art?

39:31.022 --> 39:32.624
I didn't know
you were into art.

39:32.957 --> 39:34.325
Yeah, me neither.

39:38.963 --> 39:40.732
The one on
Washington and Cherry?

39:41.032 --> 39:43.434
- Yeah, that's the one.
- That's pretty fancy.

39:43.668 --> 39:44.902
How'd you get a job there?

39:50.908 --> 39:51.776
Michael...

39:53.378 --> 39:54.412
Yeah?

39:54.445 --> 39:56.213
What's inside
that head of yours?

40:12.363 --> 40:13.698
We've
heard too many companies,

40:13.731 --> 40:15.900
too many battalions
wanna walk the road.

40:16.134 --> 40:18.703
This is
CBS News Special Report.

40:19.504 --> 40:23.641
The world of Charlie Company
with CBS News Correspondent-

40:23.875 --> 40:28.312
...their attitude since 1970.
A sense of independence.

40:28.746 --> 40:30.581
Sometimes there was
open rebellion.

40:30.815 --> 40:32.750
I'm here.

40:32.784 --> 40:35.653
It was an internal
conflict within the Armed Forces

40:48.266 --> 40:49.901
Why can't you stay?

40:51.569 --> 40:54.639
He's my
brother. He's my family. I-

40:57.742 --> 41:01.345
- I'll be there to-I'm like,
I'm like, I'm like his brother.

41:01.579 --> 41:02.947
I'm gonna take care
of him out there.

41:03.181 --> 41:04.716
- Tommy's going too.
- No!

41:04.749 --> 41:06.684
We're gonna look after
each other and we're gonna-

41:12.724 --> 41:14.425
- So you're just
gonna leave?

41:14.792 --> 41:16.828
Why can't you stay?

41:16.861 --> 41:19.263
We're gonna take
care of each other out there...

41:19.497 --> 41:21.733
We're
determined to survive.

41:21.966 --> 41:25.703
Yes! Yes! Yes!

41:25.937 --> 41:27.905
They insisted
on having something that-

41:35.379 --> 41:36.380
Pass, Dad.

41:40.384 --> 41:41.252
Hi, Dad.

41:50.328 --> 41:50.995
Hey.

41:54.999 --> 41:55.867
Amazing.

42:16.988 --> 42:20.625
<i>My life before the war now
feels like a distant dream.</i>

42:21.626 --> 42:26.664
<i>When your every day is kill
or be killed, there's almost a</i>

42:27.799 --> 42:29.967
<i>comfort to
the simplicity of it.</i>

42:31.135 --> 42:32.837
<i>And then you come back.</i>

42:33.437 --> 42:35.339
<i>And it's almost as if war</i>

42:36.641 --> 42:38.609
<i>made more sense
than it does over here.</i>

42:40.611 --> 42:42.580
<i>I knew guys that kept
going back to Nam.</i>

42:43.948 --> 42:45.650
<i>I thought they were crazy.</i>

42:46.517 --> 42:48.019
<i>But once I got back,</i>

42:48.553 --> 42:50.454
<i>I finally understood why.</i>

42:51.823 --> 42:53.524
<i>You come back to a world</i>

42:54.525 --> 42:56.027
<i>you can no longer remember.</i>

43:00.765 --> 43:02.900
Dear Michael,

43:04.402 --> 43:07.004
I hope this letter finds
you in good health.

43:08.673 --> 43:10.041
I can't pretend to imagine

43:10.275 --> 43:12.877
what you've been through
these last few months.

43:14.946 --> 43:19.584
Enclosed is a picture of
your newborn son, Jacob.

43:25.089 --> 43:28.392
We couldn't bring ourselves
to give you this news earlier

43:28.626 --> 43:32.363
and it saddens me to
tell you this, Michael.

43:35.132 --> 43:37.835
Mary died giving birth
to your son.

43:39.971 --> 43:42.773
Complications in childbirth.

43:45.209 --> 43:48.613
He needs you now more
than ever with her gone

43:49.480 --> 43:50.882
and we need you as well.

43:54.452 --> 43:57.455
He's here with us.
We're waiting for you.

44:11.903 --> 44:14.005
<i>Hardship discharge.</i>

44:16.474 --> 44:18.175
<i>I guess they didn't
need me anymore.</i>

44:19.744 --> 44:21.712
<i>But that didn't matter.</i>

44:22.446 --> 44:24.615
<i>I had a son
to look after now.</i>

44:25.583 --> 44:28.185
<i>Mary's parents were taking
care of him for me.</i>

44:30.187 --> 44:31.756
<i>So I was going home.</i>

44:52.810 --> 44:53.678
Michael.

45:00.551 --> 45:01.218
Come.

45:47.732 --> 45:49.867
Would you like to hold your son?

46:14.025 --> 46:15.826
My son.

46:36.247 --> 46:39.284
Don't worry, your father's here.
Everything's gonna be all right.

46:54.031 --> 46:54.899
Vinny...

46:59.136 --> 47:00.004
Vinny!

47:03.707 --> 47:05.343
I can't find it.

47:08.746 --> 47:10.014
I can't find it.

47:13.318 --> 47:18.189
My compass.

47:18.222 --> 47:21.192
Vinny, I can't find
my compass, man!

47:32.036 --> 47:33.804
I'm so-I'm sorry.

47:47.419 --> 47:49.053
Leave it at the door.

47:56.894 --> 47:58.028
Hungry?

48:00.231 --> 48:01.665
Sorry for waking you.

48:04.201 --> 48:05.703
Don't worry about it.

48:05.736 --> 48:07.272
I needed to get a headstart
on cleaning anyway.

48:07.506 --> 48:08.873
I can see that.

48:20.084 --> 48:21.218
Oh, you like that?

48:22.119 --> 48:23.754
I brought groceries, you know?

48:24.121 --> 48:29.693
I owe you one, missy.

48:29.727 --> 48:31.429
This is a
historic moment.

48:31.662 --> 48:36.233
The arrival of the North
Vietnamese Army in Saigon.

48:36.468 --> 48:39.703
Right in the middle of
Saigon, just after 12 o'clock,

48:40.104 --> 48:43.308
Just after noon. Here they are
pouring down the main avenue.

48:43.542 --> 48:45.009
This war's gonna be over soon.

48:45.242 --> 48:47.011
This war is never gonna be over.

48:47.811 --> 48:50.948
Seriously Michael, it's
just a matter of time.

48:53.418 --> 48:56.754
You know, thanks for
breakfast but I gotta get going.

48:58.756 --> 48:59.790
You barely ate.

49:00.024 --> 49:01.359
I'll finish it later.

49:01.759 --> 49:04.028
Michael, listen, uh...

49:04.695 --> 49:07.798
A few of us are getting
together later and, well,

49:08.300 --> 49:11.202
I completely understand if
you don't want to come but

49:11.469 --> 49:13.471
I guess what
I'm trying to say is-

49:14.238 --> 49:15.239
Spit it out, Jane.

49:16.508 --> 49:17.975
There's a protest.

49:19.043 --> 49:20.445
Jane.

49:20.478 --> 49:25.149
Look. Just come by and hear
it out, see how you feel.

49:27.184 --> 49:29.454
- Just think about-
- Don't!

49:40.864 --> 49:42.833
You should let your hair
down more, you know.

49:49.407 --> 49:51.775
Four days,
you hear me. Four days!

49:52.009 --> 49:55.946
Hey, Mr. Mortetti! Nice
to hear you this morning!

49:56.180 --> 49:57.282
Fuck off!

49:58.148 --> 49:59.750
What was all that about?

50:00.918 --> 50:02.487
- I think I made a friend.
- Oh really?

50:02.721 --> 50:04.154
- Jane.
- Let's see.

50:04.188 --> 50:05.089
Hey!

50:05.323 --> 50:06.991
Jane, please.

50:07.024 --> 50:10.194
Nice, looks like you got it
all figured out, don't you?

50:10.428 --> 50:12.096
- What, like you?
- Like me?

50:12.330 --> 50:14.098
- Gimme a break.
- No, what about me?

50:14.499 --> 50:16.867
Go back out there and fight
for shit that doesn't exist.

50:17.101 --> 50:18.303
At least I stand
for something.

50:18.536 --> 50:19.837
Stop! Stop!

50:21.573 --> 50:22.906
You stand for nothing...

50:24.074 --> 50:25.477
but yourself.

50:27.177 --> 50:28.779
That's not true.

50:32.983 --> 50:33.851
Go.

50:56.508 --> 50:59.076
<i>They talk about
the horrors of war.</i>

50:59.778 --> 51:01.513
<i>But that's just what it is.</i>

51:03.247 --> 51:04.482
<i>Just talk.</i>

51:05.583 --> 51:07.117
<i>If you've ever seen it,</i>

51:08.553 --> 51:10.388
<i>you don't talk about it.</i>

51:12.056 --> 51:15.159
<i>Because there is no talk.</i>

51:15.993 --> 51:18.596
<i>There aren't any words
to describe it right.</i>

51:20.197 --> 51:21.965
<i>Because it's not words.</i>

51:22.801 --> 51:26.338
<i>It's images of your friends
getting shot up.</i>

51:28.138 --> 51:32.976
<i>It's sounds of screams and
the deathly silence afterwards.</i>

51:34.011 --> 51:37.981
<i>It's smells of their stench
and rotting flesh.</i>

51:42.253 --> 51:47.359
<i>It's bloodstains you can't
ever wash away.</i>

53:28.760 --> 53:30.295
Any minute now.

53:36.668 --> 53:38.336
It's a little chilly
out there tonight.

53:38.603 --> 53:40.305
Where the fuck have you been?

53:40.338 --> 53:41.606
Who the fuck is this?

53:42.574 --> 53:44.007
Joe, nice to meet you.

53:44.409 --> 53:45.677
Danny!

53:45.710 --> 53:47.044
I meant to tell you about this.

53:47.278 --> 53:49.046
- You meant to tell me?
- Yeah.

53:49.280 --> 53:50.715
- Is there a problem here?
- No, there's no problem.

53:50.949 --> 53:53.551
Yeah, there's a fucking problem!
Who the fuck is this?!

53:55.520 --> 53:57.087
Look, I'm not gonna get
in your way, all right?

53:57.322 --> 53:59.990
This is - shut up - this is Joe.

54:00.224 --> 54:02.059
He's my kid sister's boyfriend,
all right?

54:02.092 --> 54:04.362
You're out of your fucking mind.
Danny, what are you doing to me?

54:04.596 --> 54:06.264
Come on, look, I'm not
gonna get it your way.

54:06.498 --> 54:08.299
- Joey, do me a favor, will ya?
- Yeah.

54:08.533 --> 54:09.300
Shut the fuck up.

54:09.534 --> 54:12.470
Shut the fuck up.

54:12.504 --> 54:15.038
Look he's really down to do this
with us, all right?

54:16.841 --> 54:18.643
You're out
of your fucking mind.

54:18.676 --> 54:20.645
You told me this would be easy.
We're in, we're out!

54:21.211 --> 54:24.081
Nothing's changed, okay?
He's just gonna be a lookout.

54:24.315 --> 54:25.517
- A lookout?!
- That's right.

54:25.750 --> 54:27.352
Believe me, we might need him.

54:27.785 --> 54:29.320
Fucking Christ.

54:31.489 --> 54:33.056
Look, I'm not gonna
get in y'all's way.

54:33.090 --> 54:35.260
- I know you're not gonna get-
- All right, all right!

54:35.493 --> 54:37.562
We fuckin' heard you, you fuck!
Shut the fuck up.

54:44.302 --> 54:45.703
All right, nice to meet you.

54:46.437 --> 54:47.805
Yeah.

54:47.839 --> 54:50.575
All right, one big family
reunion, all right, okay.

54:50.808 --> 54:55.045
Look, anything happens
with this kid, it's on you.

54:55.413 --> 54:58.349
Fuck that! It's on him!

54:58.583 --> 54:59.817
You know that, don't you?

55:00.050 --> 55:02.185
Yeah, yeah Danny, I get you.

55:02.520 --> 55:03.788
Now can we do this? I'm ready.

55:29.514 --> 55:31.214
Where do we start?

55:31.248 --> 55:32.817
Check the desk over there.
There must be a key somewhere.

55:33.051 --> 55:34.352
A key?!

55:34.385 --> 55:35.620
I thought you said they hid it.

55:35.853 --> 55:37.422
That's what I said.

55:37.455 --> 55:39.390
Then how do you know
we need a goddamn key?!

55:39.624 --> 55:41.191
Shut the fuck up
and help me, will you?

55:41.224 --> 55:43.294
Danny, I swear to
Christ, it better be here.

55:43.528 --> 55:44.596
Lower your voice.

55:44.829 --> 55:45.863
- Guys, guys!
- What?

55:46.129 --> 55:48.666
Sh. I think I heard something.

55:55.573 --> 55:56.441
Hello?

55:57.709 --> 55:58.576
Hello?

56:00.778 --> 56:02.647
Is someone down there?!

56:08.586 --> 56:10.788
Albert, who is it?

56:13.424 --> 56:14.859
Don't you fuckin' move!
Where is it?!

56:17.996 --> 56:19.364
- What the fuck, man?!
- Don't make me

56:19.597 --> 56:23.166
ask you again!
Where the fuck is it?!

56:23.401 --> 56:24.736
What the fuck, man?!

56:24.969 --> 56:27.772
Goddammit! Shut that
fucking bitch up right now!

56:28.006 --> 56:29.374
Be cool, man!

56:29.607 --> 56:31.576
I got it! I got it! I'll do it.

56:32.543 --> 56:34.612
Keep looking, dammit!

56:35.178 --> 56:37.649
What the fuck, lady?!

56:39.851 --> 56:41.319
Shut up, lady!

56:41.352 --> 56:43.821
You have no idea
of the consequences.

56:44.355 --> 56:46.724
Shut up, lady,
shut up, shut up!

56:46.958 --> 56:48.860
Take it easy, kid!

56:48.893 --> 56:51.462
You have no idea who
you're trying to take from.

56:52.030 --> 56:54.197
You're not gonna
get away with it.

56:55.566 --> 56:56.434
Well I plan to.

56:57.568 --> 56:58.936
Where is it, man?

56:58.970 --> 57:01.406
There ain't nothing here,
man. There ain't nothing here!

57:01.639 --> 57:02.573
What do we do, man?

57:02.807 --> 57:03.941
It's here! It's here!

57:04.207 --> 57:05.343
Where the fuck is it?!

57:05.576 --> 57:06.644
I'm thinking!

57:06.878 --> 57:08.245
You're thinking?!

57:08.780 --> 57:10.748
Fuck you, Danny!

57:13.751 --> 57:15.353
Kid, I told you to take it easy.

57:15.687 --> 57:17.922
You see what you
made me do, huh, you see?

57:18.221 --> 57:21.726
Everybody shut the fuck up!
I can't hear myself think!

57:23.695 --> 57:24.962
All right, fuck it, that's it.

57:24.996 --> 57:26.798
Fuck it, we gotta move,
you hear me, you hear me?!

57:27.065 --> 57:28.666
I said fuck it! Let's go!

57:29.033 --> 57:30.635
Come on, man.

57:30.902 --> 57:31.736
Danny?

57:37.575 --> 57:51.556
Shh.

57:51.589 --> 57:55.727
I'm not gonna say it again,
you fuckin' cheapskate.

57:56.094 --> 57:57.662
No more playing around.

57:59.597 --> 58:03.267
She dies if we don't find
nothing, you understand?

58:05.303 --> 58:06.938
- Do you understand?!
- Yes!

58:08.639 --> 58:10.708
- Danny.
- Shut up!

58:11.042 --> 58:13.277
- Danny, don't do this.
- Shut up!

58:13.511 --> 58:15.313
- What are you fucking doing?
- Shut the fuck up!

58:15.546 --> 58:16.380
What the fuck are you doing?

58:16.614 --> 58:17.482
Joe! Do it!

58:18.382 --> 58:19.484
No!

58:19.717 --> 58:21.018
Lemme do it! Lemme do it!

58:21.252 --> 58:22.620
Hold up! Hold up!

58:22.854 --> 58:23.921
No?

58:24.155 --> 58:25.022
Okay.

58:25.256 --> 58:27.492
No? You gonna tell me?

58:28.059 --> 58:29.460
Where the fuck is it?

58:30.361 --> 58:31.829
Come on! Tell me!

58:32.063 --> 58:34.031
- Okay.
- Okay?

58:34.398 --> 58:36.334
- Okay.
- That's it.

58:36.567 --> 58:39.604
Take me to it. Joe!
Go with him, Joe!

58:39.837 --> 58:41.539
- You lucky bitch.
- Hurry up, man!

59:00.725 --> 59:02.660

59:02.693 --> 59:04.896
Move! Move!
Don't look at her.

59:05.363 --> 59:07.298
Don't look at her.
She's dead already. Go!

59:07.532 --> 59:09.667
Eyes front, bitch! Eyes front!

59:10.201 --> 59:12.703

59:13.037 --> 59:14.739

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:15.006 --> 59:16.040
I'm opening, I'm opening.

59:30.154 --> 59:30.988
Stop this!

59:35.893 --> 59:37.328
You fucking told her.

59:37.562 --> 59:38.362
Open it now!

59:38.596 --> 59:39.463
Don't do this!

59:40.598 --> 59:42.600
Jane, leave now.

59:42.900 --> 59:44.101
No.

59:44.135 --> 59:45.736
Michael, get her the
fuck outta here, man.

59:46.003 --> 59:47.572
Please, go home.

59:47.905 --> 59:48.773
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:49.740 --> 59:51.042
I think we got something!

59:51.709 --> 59:52.710
It's too late.

59:52.743 --> 59:54.111
Get her the fuck

I can't do that, man.
Listen to me!

Michael!

01:00:50.401 --> 01:00:51.602
Don't!

01:00:51.636 --> 01:00:52.837
Michael, just forget it!

01:00:53.104 --> 01:00:54.572
It's gonna be all right.

01:00:54.872 --> 01:00:57.141
- I'm gonna count to three.
- Michael!

01:00:57.441 --> 01:00:58.843
It's gonna be all right.

01:00:59.744 --> 01:01:00.945
- One...

01:01:01.178 --> 01:01:02.713
I'm not leaving without that!

01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:04.849
- Two...

01:01:09.153 --> 01:01:10.187
Three...

01:01:24.669 --> 01:01:25.970
Jackpot, motherfucker.

01:01:30.708 --> 01:01:33.077
Grab whatever you can!

01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:34.812
You fuckin' hear me?!
Let's get outta here, man!

01:01:35.046 --> 01:01:36.213
Go, please!

01:01:36.547 --> 01:01:37.848
It's gonna be okay.

01:01:38.149 --> 01:01:39.251
No.

01:01:39.284 --> 01:01:40.952
Did you fuckin' hear me?!
Let's go!

01:01:40.985 --> 01:01:43.988
It's okay! Let's leave and
forget any of this happened!

01:01:44.289 --> 01:01:46.791
So you're gonna listen

01:01:50.695 --> 01:01:53.631
Day after day I hear you,
yap-yap-yap, blah-blah-blah...

01:01:53.864 --> 01:01:56.667
You can't pay shit!
That you ain't worth shit!

01:01:57.001 --> 01:01:58.736
I go ahead and offer you shit

01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:01.072
and you puss out on me
like a little bitch?!

01:02:03.841 --> 01:02:06.177
- Don't listen to this psycho!
- Shut the fuck! Up!

01:02:06.411 --> 01:02:07.712
Fuck you, Danny!

01:02:08.079 --> 01:02:09.847
- Fuck me?!
- Yeah, fuck you!

01:02:10.081 --> 01:02:11.615
Noooo...

01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:13.517
Fuck you, bitch!

01:02:46.684 --> 01:02:48.119
<i>If a person has a soul</i>

01:02:51.155 --> 01:02:52.623
<i>I think it's like a sponge.</i>

01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:58.062
<i>A recorder of events</i>

01:03:01.198 --> 01:03:02.633

01:03:25.756 --> 01:03:26.991
<i>Forever.</i>

You don't talk much,
do you, son?

01:05:20.572 --> 01:05:24.643
Well, that's all right. I'll
wake you when the ride's over.

<i>I didn't have
a reason anymore.</i>

01:05:40.858 --> 01:05:41.959
<i>No direction.</i>

01:05:44.895 --> 01:05:46.030
<i>No schedule.</i>

01:05:48.266 --> 01:05:49.833
<i>No agenda.</i>

01:05:50.968 --> 01:05:52.102
<i>No tasks.</i>

01:05:54.539 --> 01:05:56.907
<i>No leader
telling me what to do.</i>

01:06:01.145 --> 01:06:02.780
<i>It's all gone now.</i>

01:06:04.148 --> 01:06:06.384
<i>And I'm all alone.</i>

01:06:24.802 --> 01:06:25.970
<i>Searching</i>

01:06:30.542 --> 01:06:31.909
<i>for something</i>

01:06:37.382 --> 01:06:41.386
<i>a foothold</i>

01:06:41.419 --> 01:06:43.787
<i>to keep me from sliding
off the face of the earth</i>

01:06:47.925 --> 01:06:49.126
<i>for answers</i>

01:06:51.396 --> 01:06:52.930
<i>for an escape</i>

01:06:55.132 --> 01:06:56.368
<i>for hope</i>

01:06:58.470 --> 01:07:00.070
<i>a way forward</i>

01:07:02.307 --> 01:07:03.974
<i>a way through it all</i>

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:07.945
<i>to take me anywhere</i>

01:07:09.847 --> 01:07:12.049
<i>anywhere but here.</i>

01:07:17.855 --> 01:07:20.858
<i>And then eventually,
sometimes,</i>

01:07:22.327 --> 01:07:25.363
<i>you find that some things
start searching for you.</i>

01:08:55.386 --> 01:08:56.421
You're making me come.

01:09:07.997 --> 01:09:08.666
Yes!

01:09:11.234 --> 01:09:16.374
Oh, God.

01:09:16.408 --> 01:09:19.042
- Do something for me?
- Oh, anything, baby.

01:09:19.477 --> 01:09:21.078
Close your eyes.

01:09:23.013 --> 01:09:30.354
That's it.

01:09:30.388 --> 01:09:33.189
Shh, shh, shh,
don't breathe now.

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:40.365
Saddle up!

01:09:41.165 --> 01:09:44.201
- Oh God, oh God...
- You like that?

01:09:44.569 --> 01:09:46.103
- Yeah.
- Louder!

01:09:58.683 --> 01:10:01.084
Hey, where you going?

01:10:01.419 --> 01:10:02.287
Where you going?

01:10:06.558 --> 01:10:08.025
Where you going?

01:10:25.142 --> 01:10:26.611
Come on!

01:10:26.644 --> 01:10:28.646
You better be washing
that shit, motherfucker.

01:10:29.814 --> 01:10:31.215
Are my windows clean?

01:10:31.449 --> 01:10:33.685
That's him, that's him.
That's him, Billy Boy.

01:10:33.918 --> 01:10:40.023
So, man. You are havin' some
sort of problem there, fella?

01:10:40.525 --> 01:10:42.527
Look, why don't you guys do
yourselves a favor, huh?

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.329
Walk on.

01:10:44.362 --> 01:10:47.097
We got an out-of-town baby
killer on our hands, don't we?

01:10:47.432 --> 01:10:48.633
Woo, baby boy.

01:10:48.867 --> 01:10:51.769
We surely do, Billy,
we surely do.

01:10:54.204 --> 01:10:59.209
I'm gonna need you to back
the fuck up from that car.

01:10:59.944 --> 01:11:02.079
Do it, faggot!
You got a problem here?

01:11:02.313 --> 01:11:03.113
Listen to him, boy.

01:11:04.849 --> 01:11:06.284
Turn around!

01:11:06.317 --> 01:11:09.186
What the fuck?

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:12.222
I said
turn your ass around, boy.

01:11:13.525 --> 01:11:15.092
- Seems like he likes it.
- What the fuck?

01:11:15.326 --> 01:11:17.127
This some sorta
fuckin' comedy show, huh?

01:11:17.562 --> 01:11:19.731
What the fuck is so
funny with you, bitch?

01:11:21.231 --> 01:11:22.500
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

01:11:22.534 --> 01:11:23.735
Motherfucker, I'll give
you something to laugh at.

01:11:23.768 --> 01:11:24.669
I'll give you
something to giggle.

01:11:24.903 --> 01:11:26.203
He's a fuckin' loon, Lloyd.

01:11:26.571 --> 01:11:28.640
- You wanna know?
- Tell me, boy!

01:11:28.907 --> 01:11:30.308
You fuckin' tell me.

01:11:30.341 --> 01:11:34.211
There ain't nothing,
nothing

01:11:34.445 --> 01:11:38.783
that you can do to me that
hell hasn't already done.

01:11:40.385 --> 01:11:42.052
- Fuck.
- He's talkin' purty!

01:11:43.021 --> 01:11:44.289
Motherfucker.

01:11:46.858 --> 01:11:48.560
Let's get him now, boys.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.107
<i>Sure. I needed help.</i>

01:12:05.476 --> 01:12:07.144
<i>A little support.</i>

01:12:08.479 --> 01:12:10.147
<i>In the end,</i>

01:12:10.715 --> 01:12:12.383
<i>I just needed the war to stop.</i>

01:12:14.919 --> 01:12:17.755
Mickey, I love you.

01:12:18.155 --> 01:12:20.692
You're like a brother to
me but you got a life here.

01:12:21.025 --> 01:12:22.360
You're kidding,
we're going together?

01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:24.262
We're going together, huh?

01:12:24.295 --> 01:12:26.229
Would
you like to hold your son?

01:12:32.403 --> 01:12:34.405
Just hope we make it out
all right.

01:12:34.639 --> 01:12:36.341
Hey, Mikey! Let's go!

01:12:36.574 --> 01:12:39.611
Your son needs
his father. Come back to us.

01:12:40.645 --> 01:12:42.380
Move out, move out.

01:12:42.614 --> 01:12:44.782
Mikey, this is not a
fuckin' suggestion, man.

01:12:45.016 --> 01:12:46.451
This is a draft card,
you understand me?

01:12:46.718 --> 01:12:48.720
I'm so sorry! Medic!

01:12:50.588 --> 01:12:52.490
Vinny,
I can't find my compass, man.

01:12:53.424 --> 01:12:56.327
Enclosed is
a picture of your newborn son.

01:12:57.028 --> 01:12:59.897
He's here with us,
we're waiting for you.

01:13:56.754 --> 01:13:58.221
Hello?

01:14:00.291 --> 01:14:00.958
Hello?

01:14:03.561 --> 01:14:06.196
Hello, is anybody there?

01:14:06.564 --> 01:14:07.932
Who is it, baby?

01:14:08.299 --> 01:14:10.902
I don't know,
no one's answering.

01:14:11.936 --> 01:14:13.203
Hello?

01:14:15.273 --> 01:14:15.940
Hello?

01:14:19.277 --> 01:14:19.944
Michael?

01:14:21.012 --> 01:14:21.913
Is that you?

01:15:48.366 --> 01:15:49.767
Vinny.

01:15:53.004 --> 01:15:53.838
Vinny!

01:15:57.508 --> 01:15:58.776
I can't find it.

01:16:02.547 --> 01:16:03.781
I can't find it.

01:16:07.418 --> 01:16:12.390
My compass.

01:16:12.423 --> 01:16:14.525
Vinny, I can't find
my compass, man!

01:16:18.496 --> 01:16:21.065
Hey Mickey. I got it, man.

01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:44.755
No, Vinny, no!

01:16:57.101 --> 01:16:58.703
<i>When I was a little boy,</i>

01:17:00.171 --> 01:17:01.772
<i>my mother gave this to me.</i>

01:17:03.708 --> 01:17:08.579
<i>And she told me that
if I was ever lost or scared</i>

01:17:09.146 --> 01:17:10.882
<i>that this would lead me
back home.</i>

01:17:12.083 --> 01:17:15.119
<i>And now, I want you to have it.</i>

01:17:16.554 --> 01:17:19.023
<i>And if you ever feel alone,</i>

01:17:19.457 --> 01:17:21.959
<i>you just take out this compass</i>

01:17:22.294 --> 01:17:24.495
<i>and know that
I'm always with you.</i>

01:17:25.796 --> 01:17:28.065
<i>Because I love you very much,
my son.</i>

01:17:41.112 --> 01:17:42.780
This is Jacob.

01:17:43.014 --> 01:17:44.949
You're not gonna
believe this.

01:17:46.617 --> 01:17:48.419
We found your father.

01:17:49.487 --> 01:17:50.955
Here's the address.

01:18:14.045 --> 01:18:15.646
<i>My mother used to say</i>

01:18:17.014 --> 01:18:18.616
<i>you either bend</i>

01:18:19.917 --> 01:18:21.519
<i>or you break.</i>

01:18:23.054 --> 01:18:24.655
<i>And when you break,</i>

01:18:25.324 --> 01:18:30.795
<i>sometimes you grow stronger
in the broken places.</i>

01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:35.700
<i>And sometimes, you don't.</i>

01:18:38.869 --> 01:18:40.471
<i>But if you can last</i>

01:18:42.274 --> 01:18:43.874
<i>if you can stick it out</i>

01:18:46.043 --> 01:18:47.645
<i>time has a funny way</i>

01:18:50.014 --> 01:18:54.618
<i>of curing even the incurable.</i>

01:18:56.020 --> 01:18:57.621
<i>And then sometimes</i>

01:18:59.190 --> 01:19:01.192
<i>when we're standing
on the precipice</i>

01:19:03.227 --> 01:19:05.229
<i>staring into the abyss
of it all</i>

01:19:08.266 --> 01:19:13.938
<i>life can offer us even
just glimmer of hope</i>

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:18.042
<i>Take it.</i>

01:19:18.343 --> 01:19:19.944
<i>It's worth it.</i>

01:19:21.145 --> 01:19:22.747
<i>And then maybe</i>

01:19:23.714 --> 01:19:25.116
<i>just maybe</i>

01:19:27.285 --> 01:19:28.886
<i>you can have some peace</i>

01:19:29.887 --> 01:19:31.289
<i>my friend.</i>
