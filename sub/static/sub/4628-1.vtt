00:12.541 --> 00:14.540
(Narrator) 'He had been living in the city
for nine years,

00:14.666 --> 00:16.499
'and was only now coming
to think of it as home.

00:17.250 --> 00:18.749
'Characteristically not in a hurry,

00:18.875 --> 00:21.874
'but perpetually enraged
by slow foot traffic before him,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.707
'Philip was on this day meeting for lunch
with Mona, his ex-girlfriend,

00:25.833 --> 00:27.999
'whom he had dated
throughout a portion of college.

00:29.750 --> 00:33.915
'As with any punctual individual,
Philip loathed when people ran late,

00:34.041 --> 00:36.124
'which Mona typically was.

00:37.708 --> 00:39.207
'By the time Mona made her way to Philip,

00:39.333 --> 00:41.790
'he was in a state of rage
and on the verge of storming out ‒

00:41.916 --> 00:43.415
'a reaction he was known to often have

00:43.541 --> 00:46.124
'towards the end
of their two-year relationship.

00:47.208 --> 00:49.165
'During the arguments
that led to their breakup,

00:49.291 --> 00:52.457
'Mona repeatedly emphasised
Philip's short fuse and poor temper

00:52.583 --> 00:55.749
'as key factors in no longer being capable
of tolerating his company.'

00:55.875 --> 00:58.874
- It's just crazy that you're late to me.
- Can we stop talking about it?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.457
25 minutes I'm waiting, almost 30.
It's an insult.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.915
Also, I have a really busy day,
so now I have less than an hour.

01:04.041 --> 01:05.582
Probably not even enough time
to eat anything.

01:05.708 --> 01:06.957
Maybe a grilled cheese for me.

01:07.083 --> 01:08.540
I had that the other day.
It's disgusting.

01:08.666 --> 01:11.457
So I'll ask you how you are, right?
Things are good?

01:11.583 --> 01:12.915
Things are good with me.

01:13.041 --> 01:14.665
Allie and I just finally found
a new roommate.

01:14.791 --> 01:15.915
Oh, what's-her-ass moved?

01:16.041 --> 01:18.415
- She got married, like, two years ago.
- Figures.

01:19.291 --> 01:21.249
- Is that the new book?
- Er... yeah.

01:21.375 --> 01:23.249
I wasn't sure you'd noticed, or heard.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.207
- OK.
- I'm just getting ready.

01:25.333 --> 01:27.415
Things are gonna be pretty crazy for me
after the release.

01:27.541 --> 01:29.999
In fact, this might be
the last time I'm home

01:30.125 --> 01:33.540
for more than a week at a time
for the next eight or possibly nine months.

01:33.666 --> 01:35.540
Actually, yeah, definitely.
It's just busy.

01:36.166 --> 01:38.040
Los Angeles in January,
San Francisco...

01:38.166 --> 01:40.290
Powell's in Portland,
the whole West Coast thing, really.

01:40.416 --> 01:41.874
I'm told to expect
big things out there.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.040
- You sound like you're bragging.
- That's because I am bragging.

01:44.166 --> 01:46.249
And you're doing a really hurtful job
of sounding unfazed.

01:46.375 --> 01:48.457
And do you know why that is?
Because you're not pretending.

01:48.583 --> 01:50.499
You're not interested in this or me,
not even a little.

01:50.625 --> 01:53.165
- Why would you say that?
- Because you never believed in me.

01:53.291 --> 01:54.665
- And you don't now.
- Well, good for you.

01:54.791 --> 01:56.374
No, not good for me.
Great for me.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.707
You know, you told me many times,
now that I think about it, actually,

01:58.833 --> 02:01.582
that my goals were unreasonable
and foolhardy.

02:01.708 --> 02:03.040
Am I recalling this correctly?

02:03.166 --> 02:05.707
That my dream, the only dream I've had
since I was 14 years old,

02:05.833 --> 02:07.290
to write and publish a novel of my own,

02:07.416 --> 02:08.957
wasn't something I could just
reach out and have.

02:09.083 --> 02:11.874
Hard work, you tell me. Years of
working up from the bottom, you tell me.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.540
Well, you know something?
You were wrong.

02:13.666 --> 02:16.832
Dead wrong, actually.
About me and everything.

02:16.958 --> 02:18.957
This was for you.
It's an advance copy.

02:19.083 --> 02:21.707
I'd even written a little note
on the dedication page and everything.

02:21.833 --> 02:24.374
But you know something?
You don't support me and you never did.

02:24.500 --> 02:25.957
So you don't get this gift from me.

02:26.083 --> 02:28.582
Not today, not ever. Forever.

02:29.958 --> 02:32.249
You were unkind,
and you tried to stray me from my path.

02:32.375 --> 02:35.165
And had I listened to you,
I'd be nothing right now.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.832
(Narrator) 'Philip had never been one
for speaking his mind,

02:48.958 --> 02:51.082
'preferring instead
to bottle up his emotions,

02:51.208 --> 02:54.874
'eventually forgetting or utilising them
for creative inspiration.

03:01.666 --> 03:05.124
'However, this outpouring resulted in
Philip feeling more satisfied and content

03:05.250 --> 03:06.874
'than he had in some time,

03:07.000 --> 03:08.957
'and it was for this reason
that he immediately telephoned

03:09.083 --> 03:10.665
'his college roommate, Parker,

03:10.791 --> 03:13.999
'with the intention of delivering to him
an equally robust dressing down.'

03:14.125 --> 03:16.124
You blew people's minds, man.

03:16.250 --> 03:20.124
Now look at you. You're just a combination
of strange fucking colours.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.790
It was gonna be you and me, man.
Ring a bell?

03:22.916 --> 03:26.124
Sophomore year, creative writing seminar,
it was us versus them.

03:26.250 --> 03:28.624
- What the fuck happened?
- I...

03:28.750 --> 03:32.790
Apparently not everybody's cut out
for life in the fast lane.

03:32.916 --> 03:35.332
You make me want back
every minute of time I wasted with you,

03:35.458 --> 03:37.540
dreaming of a future we could share.

03:40.791 --> 03:42.749
Our declaration of principles.

03:43.708 --> 03:44.707
Remember this?

03:45.833 --> 03:47.207
Worthless now.

03:49.291 --> 03:50.915
I was so stupid to think you wanted it.

03:51.041 --> 03:52.790
I wanted it, you fucking asshole!

03:52.916 --> 03:54.999
I did want it.
I wanted it more than you could know.

03:55.125 --> 03:57.249
It's not so easy for everybody, OK?

03:57.375 --> 04:02.082
We can't all be as lucky and talented
as the great Philip Lewis Friedman.

04:02.541 --> 04:03.957
You know what, though?
I'm glad, I'm glad.

04:04.083 --> 04:06.207
Because if both of our goals
had come true,

04:06.333 --> 04:08.707
then I'd be just as much
of an insufferable piece of shit as you,

04:08.833 --> 04:10.624
you fuckin' Jew bastard!

04:10.750 --> 04:12.457
(Laughs mockingly)

04:18.333 --> 04:19.999
This could have been us.

04:21.541 --> 04:23.207
Instead, I'm all alone.

04:30.333 --> 04:33.040
(Narrator) 'Returning home to the apartment
he shared with Ashley Kane,

04:33.166 --> 04:34.790
'his girlfriend of two years,

04:34.916 --> 04:37.915
'Philip found himself gripped
by uncontrollable lust,

04:38.041 --> 04:41.207
'temporarily forgetting the ambivalence
and negligence towards him

04:41.333 --> 04:43.790
'that she was increasingly incapable
of concealing,

04:43.916 --> 04:46.457
'as her success as a photographer
in the art world

04:46.583 --> 04:48.332
'led to consistent and
lucrative commercial work.'

04:48.458 --> 04:50.624
Hello? Ashley?

04:50.750 --> 04:51.915
(Ashley) Hello.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.415
Come out.
I have a surprise for you.

04:53.541 --> 04:55.457
'For the past year,
they had been living together,

04:55.583 --> 04:57.915
'one advantage of which
was added stability,

04:58.041 --> 05:00.082
- 'and a clear head space for writing.'
- (Cork pops)

05:00.208 --> 05:03.249
'Philip would credit this with allowing him
to finish his second novel,

05:03.375 --> 05:05.874
'which he previously believed himself
unable to complete.'

05:06.000 --> 05:08.332
...Parker, and I smoked him too.
I don't know what happened.

05:08.458 --> 05:09.624
- Parker too?
- Yeah, so...

05:09.750 --> 05:11.707
- Two nemesi in one day.
- Yes.

05:11.833 --> 05:12.832
That's pretty hot.

05:14.916 --> 05:16.540
- I'm really proud of you.
- Thank you very much.

05:16.666 --> 05:18.624
I, er... I feel... No, it's insane.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.832
- It's very hot.
- What is? The champagne?

05:20.958 --> 05:22.332
- You being mean.
- Oh.

05:22.458 --> 05:23.707
Not hot when you stand like that.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.374
- It's not hot?
- (Laughs) Not hot.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.624
You ruined it.
Go back to your story.

05:30.125 --> 05:31.624
(Narrator) 'Despite these recent events,

05:31.750 --> 05:34.124
'Philip was incapable of
experiencing happiness.

05:34.916 --> 05:37.165
'He counterbalanced
his feelings of love and productivity

05:37.291 --> 05:39.457
'with periods of extreme isolation,

05:39.583 --> 05:41.999
'sometimes finding
that days on end had passed

05:42.125 --> 05:44.415
'since last leaving the house.

05:44.541 --> 05:46.665
'Shortly after the rush of severing ties

05:46.791 --> 05:49.957
'with those he believed to be poisonous
to his mental health,

05:50.083 --> 05:52.290
'Philip was too crippled
with anxiety and dread

05:52.416 --> 05:55.124
'to go outside
for the better part of a week.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.707
'Philip had harboured
increasingly romantic notions

05:59.833 --> 06:01.874
'about what this period
in his life would mean,

06:02.000 --> 06:05.374
'until one day, a few months
before the publication of his second novel,

06:05.500 --> 06:07.874
'he abruptly became
confidently disenfranchised

06:08.000 --> 06:09.499
'to the point of despondency.'

06:32.541 --> 06:34.165
You know this should be your job.

06:35.041 --> 06:36.957
- So sorry about the wait.
- Ah, it's ridiculous.

06:37.083 --> 06:40.624
30 minutes I'm out here, 40 maybe.
I'm five away from leaving.

06:40.750 --> 06:44.165
- I'm sorry. What do you want me to say?
- Nothing. I'd prefer you to say nothing.

06:44.291 --> 06:46.249
Riley, don't hold my calls.

06:46.375 --> 06:49.165
I've got some bad news,
two items of good news.

06:49.291 --> 06:50.415
Give 'em to me in that order.

06:50.541 --> 06:52.249
Bad news is you're not looking at
a good review in the Times.

06:52.375 --> 06:54.415
What? How do we know so soon?
Who's doing it?

06:54.541 --> 06:55.665
Some new woman.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.082
- She's new.
- So what's the problem?

06:58.208 --> 06:59.207
She doesn't like your book.

07:00.166 --> 07:01.915
Fuck, I really needed that.

07:02.041 --> 07:04.374
- I'll take the good news now.
- (Clears throat) Well, two things.

07:04.500 --> 07:08.290
First, you're going to be in the "35 Under 35"
issue of the New York Literary Review.

07:08.416 --> 07:10.457
- Nobody reads that anymore.
- This is something.

07:10.583 --> 07:12.707
It is not uncompetitive.
Don't be a baby.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.374
Shit.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.165
Other thing is,
Ike Zimmerman got back to me.

07:16.291 --> 07:19.415
- He liked your book, wants to meet you.
- That's huge.

07:19.541 --> 07:22.415
(Narrator) 'Ike Zimmerman was
one of the most prolific American authors

07:22.541 --> 07:24.790
'of the 1970s and '80s.

07:24.916 --> 07:26.832
'His breakthrough novel,
Madness & Women,

07:26.958 --> 07:29.999
'sold over three million copies
in hardback alone.

07:30.125 --> 07:32.999
'Lesser returns
and failed genre experiments

07:33.125 --> 07:36.999
'gave way to the triumphant comeback
Audit in 1982.

07:37.125 --> 07:38.749
'Since then he published infrequently.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.832
'He had not completed a novel
in six years.'

07:41.958 --> 07:43.582
Do you wanna look
in our wardrobe area?

07:43.708 --> 07:45.749
We can probably find you
a lighter-weight jacket.

07:45.875 --> 07:48.999
Let's just keep this jacket on me and take
the photograph sooner rather than later.

07:49.125 --> 07:52.165
We actually wanted to get a picture of you
in front of the printing press,

07:52.291 --> 07:54.124
and then the portrait.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.499
- Is that from the 1920s?
- Yeah.

07:56.625 --> 07:57.915
Well, I'm not, so let's skip it

07:58.041 --> 07:59.999
and move on over
to this yellow thing, all right?

08:00.125 --> 08:01.957
I know.
"What an asshole."

08:09.166 --> 08:10.874
(Shutter clicking)

08:15.125 --> 08:16.957
Would you mind standing?

08:21.208 --> 08:22.957
What is this for?

08:24.083 --> 08:26.832
Could you open it as though you're reading,
then look at me again?

08:26.958 --> 08:27.957
I don't wanna do that.

08:29.083 --> 08:30.290
- Why?
- It's a poor idea.

08:30.416 --> 08:33.457
Why would I be standing up
with my jacket buttoned, reading?

08:34.625 --> 08:36.207
- It's just a prop.
- I can see that.

08:36.332 --> 08:38.582
But I think it presents
a very false depiction of me.

08:38.707 --> 08:40.749
I'd much rather
this picture at least seem honest.

08:40.875 --> 08:43.332
You know, Tolkien wouldn't allow himself
to be photographed writing,

08:43.457 --> 08:44.999
because he didn't allow
anybody to watch him work.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.582
Same idea here.
Just slightly modified to suit me.

08:48.708 --> 08:49.707
Philip.

09:00.041 --> 09:01.540
I hope that wasn't too bad.

09:02.666 --> 09:05.374
It's always bad.
There's just degrees of bad.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.832
Oh, hey. How's it going?

09:08.041 --> 09:09.374
Mmh... good.

09:11.166 --> 09:12.624
We met before.

09:12.750 --> 09:15.290
Er... I don't think we have.

09:15.416 --> 09:17.207
You sure about that?

09:18.250 --> 09:21.332
Um... I wanted to tell you
I really liked your book.

09:21.458 --> 09:23.790
Those advance copies
really get around, huh?

09:23.916 --> 09:25.707
Anyway,
the first one's better.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.249
Um, I haven't read it.

09:32.416 --> 09:34.582
I'm not some weird groupie or anything.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.707
No, if you were a groupie,
you likely would have read both my books.

09:37.833 --> 09:39.999
Are there book groupies?
Author groupies?

09:40.125 --> 09:41.749
Not many, but yeah.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.665
Hey! (Whistles)
Quick thought I just had.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.707
I'm not doing any press for the book at all.
Readings, interviews. Nothing.

09:53.833 --> 09:56.165
- You cannot be serious.
- Oh, quite.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.374
That's a horrible, horrible idea.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.999
I don't like the idea of being on display.

10:00.125 --> 10:01.957
My mind is made up.
I wanna be left alone.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.290
Hi, Riley.

10:13.708 --> 10:15.332
(Ashley) I think the tie is a bit much.

10:15.458 --> 10:18.124
I'm invited to his home.
I don't wanna look like a schmo.

10:18.250 --> 10:19.582
Then maybe lose the jacket.

10:19.708 --> 10:21.665
You know, it's 80 degrees out.

10:21.791 --> 10:24.457
It looks like you don't own
a more seasonally-appropriate jacket.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.665
I don't know, I think it looks nice.

10:26.791 --> 10:29.415
Yeah. Nice, just kind of sweaty.

10:31.916 --> 10:33.874
- Philip Lewis Friedman.
- Go get 'em.

10:34.583 --> 10:35.582
- OK, bye.
- Bye.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.665
- Pleasure.
- Good luck.

10:37.791 --> 10:39.249
- Thank you.
- Fix your collar.

10:39.375 --> 10:40.374
- Huh?
- Your collar.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.624
Oh. Thank you.

10:43.083 --> 10:47.040
I'd seriously consider having a better answer
to that question if I were you.

10:47.166 --> 10:50.207
I'm filling up notebooks,
but it's nothing but worthless garbage.

10:50.333 --> 10:51.707
Don't tell people that.

10:51.833 --> 10:53.749
Makes you look lazy and stupid.

10:54.291 --> 10:55.290
Got it.

10:55.416 --> 10:57.915
That probably came out
a lot crueller than I intended.

10:58.583 --> 11:01.915
But don't make being lackadaisical
and disorganised your thing.

11:03.625 --> 11:06.790
- It sends out a message that you'll regret.
- I see.

11:10.541 --> 11:12.707
Do you have a nice place to write?

11:12.833 --> 11:14.915
I mean, that's important.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.957
You'll find that,
if you haven't already.

11:17.083 --> 11:19.290
I rented a small studio.

11:20.125 --> 11:21.624
Does it work for you?

11:21.750 --> 11:24.707
No, not really.
In fact, I rarely go.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.165
Here.

11:27.916 --> 11:31.040
I probably wouldn't have wanted
to hear this either

11:31.166 --> 11:33.082
when I was your age, but...

11:34.958 --> 11:36.665
The city.

11:36.791 --> 11:38.332
You can't get anything done here.

11:38.458 --> 11:41.749
It has a creative energy,
but not a productive energy.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.457
Quiet does not exist,
and I find that difficult.

11:46.041 --> 11:48.290
Do you know,
I've not written a single page

11:48.416 --> 11:50.749
within the city limits
these past 30 years?

11:52.000 --> 11:55.082
You'll need a country retreat,
if you can afford one.

11:55.958 --> 11:57.249
I can't.

11:57.375 --> 11:59.082
(Chuckles)

11:59.208 --> 12:00.957
Well...

12:02.958 --> 12:06.540
Of course, I had achieved
considerably more than you by now.

12:06.666 --> 12:08.999
- Not to be insulting.
- Of course.

12:09.125 --> 12:12.290
But if I can be of any assistance,
if I can help in any way,

12:12.416 --> 12:14.165
just ask outright.

12:14.291 --> 12:16.290
Don't be shy.

12:16.416 --> 12:17.957
I loved your book.

12:18.083 --> 12:20.957
- Yeah, it was OK.
- Don't denigrate yourself.

12:21.083 --> 12:22.790
It's really, really good,

12:22.916 --> 12:25.749
and it would be a shame
for me not to read another one.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.332
Hello.

12:51.291 --> 12:53.790
(♪ Upbeat lounge music playing)

13:07.125 --> 13:10.374
It's a filthy system, the way it's structured.
You can trust me on this.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.124
I'm not sorry if this kills
any of your illusions about anything.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.415
I feel like it's my job
to tell you the honesty.

13:16.541 --> 13:18.165
Nobody else has.

13:18.291 --> 13:19.499
Nobody else can.

13:19.625 --> 13:22.332
It's rare to find these things out,
and also upsetting.

13:23.916 --> 13:26.582
These little glasses.
Let me see these things.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.290
Oh, yeah, we have
the exact same affectation.

13:37.208 --> 13:38.624
Mm-mmh...

13:39.125 --> 13:40.707
Ah... Emily.

13:42.375 --> 13:43.582
Erm...

13:44.125 --> 13:46.915
Seems like a less than ideal place
to carry on.

13:48.333 --> 13:50.499
Is it 'cause you have a girlfriend?

13:52.083 --> 13:54.499
You mentioned her
in an interview.

13:55.958 --> 13:58.915
It's because it's gauche
to grope and kiss in public.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.290
You really don't remember
meeting me, do you?

14:07.416 --> 14:09.707
I had a photo shoot in that same place
when my first book came out.

14:09.833 --> 14:11.749
I gave you a copy of it.

14:11.875 --> 14:14.999
You acted like you were better than some
first-time author nobody had ever heard of,

14:15.125 --> 14:17.082
even though you were probably
still in college.

14:17.208 --> 14:19.540
I wrote my number in it, twice.

14:21.291 --> 14:24.374
I really honestly
don't remember meeting you.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.457
Sorry, but I remember you now.

14:26.583 --> 14:28.207
Oh, of course you do.

14:28.750 --> 14:30.832
OK. I'll call you.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.040
(Bicycle bell rings)

15:00.041 --> 15:01.540
(Ashley) Where were you?

15:01.666 --> 15:02.915
Out.

15:05.958 --> 15:07.665
So, my meeting with Ike today...

15:09.583 --> 15:11.249
Oh, so he's Ike now?

15:11.375 --> 15:14.165
- With Zimmerman. How's your gin?
- How was he?

15:14.291 --> 15:18.665
He has a quality
that can only be described as... chrome.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.999
- And?
- He seems to wanna help me.

15:24.916 --> 15:26.332
How can he help you?

15:26.458 --> 15:27.915
He didn't say.

15:29.166 --> 15:31.665
He's got great stories.
I'd love to hang out with him again.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.707
Do we have plans?

15:34.833 --> 15:37.624
- Do we have plans when?
- Whenever.

15:39.125 --> 15:42.665
Yes, Philip, I'd say sometime in the
indeterminate future, we may have plans.

15:42.791 --> 15:43.915
Good shoot today?

15:46.750 --> 15:48.040
Can you just leave me alone?

15:48.166 --> 15:49.665
I have to do this.

15:50.833 --> 15:52.499
You're fucking with
other people's money here.

15:52.625 --> 15:54.582
Money, money, money.
What about my integrity?

15:54.708 --> 15:56.582
You know, I can think of
a few other important writers

15:56.708 --> 15:59.165
who also took a firm no-press position.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.249
I just wanna know that you've
thought it through thoroughly.

16:01.375 --> 16:02.540
I haven't.

16:02.666 --> 16:05.749
It's a very impulsive decision,
and I'm very pleased with myself for that.

16:10.583 --> 16:12.040
Philip, this is Josh Fawn.

16:12.166 --> 16:14.999
Josh, this is Philip,
who's being a baby and an asshole.

16:15.125 --> 16:17.957
Ciao. Yes, we've met before.
We've done some panels together.

16:18.083 --> 16:20.207
Er... I remember one of them.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.999
Phil, Josh is going on a promotional tour
for his new book.

16:23.125 --> 16:24.915
That's what responsible authors do.

16:25.041 --> 16:27.707
It helps them sell copies
and benefits all parties involved.

16:27.833 --> 16:29.374
- Noted.
- We're wanting you to cover this

16:29.500 --> 16:32.832
as a feature for one of several magazines,
that we're currently negotiating with.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.749
I just like the new book,

16:34.875 --> 16:36.999
and this idea came up,
and I kind of suggested you.

16:37.875 --> 16:39.207
- Thanks, Josh.
- Interest?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.374
Terms?

16:41.500 --> 16:43.374
You'll take whatever
we can get you.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.999
It'll be two to three weeks.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.874
I assume we can get you
something like 5,000 to 8,000

16:47.000 --> 16:49.040
depending on where
we ultimately sell it to.

16:49.166 --> 16:50.707
Right in my pocket.
Sounds great.

16:50.833 --> 16:53.957
See, when I slam a door,
life opens a window. When do we leave?

16:54.083 --> 16:57.332
You gonna be speaking in little turns of phrase
like that the whole time?

16:57.458 --> 16:58.790
I might. I don't know.

16:59.583 --> 17:00.957
I think this is gonna be fun.

17:02.916 --> 17:05.332
You wanna go sit somewhere
and talk more about it?

17:06.165 --> 17:08.165
I think we're pretty much
on the same page.

17:09.125 --> 17:10.999
Hey, thanks for doing this, by the way.

17:11.750 --> 17:13.915
You don't seem to give a shit
about this at all.

17:15.665 --> 17:17.249
Sure, I do.

17:18.375 --> 17:20.290
I'm a nice guy.

17:20.415 --> 17:23.249
Read an article about me.
I'm self-deprecating.

17:33.375 --> 17:35.957
No, I'm not thrilled you're going away
for over a month.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.415
That is why I'm acting like this.

17:37.541 --> 17:39.374
Can we please not
talk about this in public?

17:39.500 --> 17:41.790
It strikes me as unlikely,
as you supported ideas like this

17:41.916 --> 17:44.415
when I still could have turned them down.
I need the money.

17:44.541 --> 17:46.874
What I said was,
it would be good for your career.

17:47.916 --> 17:50.457
I thought you meant "career"
with a dollar sign.

17:51.208 --> 17:52.374
I think we need more.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.582
Fireworks, shooting guns.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.457
Maybe we need to get arrested.

17:57.625 --> 17:59.290
Yeah, that might be
a little bit problematic

17:59.416 --> 18:01.415
for some of my younger,
more impressionable fans.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.290
I have a lot of those, I'm told.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.624
Hi.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.624
Ashley.
(Clicks tongue)

18:09.750 --> 18:11.124
Oh, my God. Hi.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.082
- Josh.
- Josh.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.374
Yeah.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.707
- Wow. How are you?
- I'm good. How you doin'?

18:16.833 --> 18:18.582
It was...

18:18.708 --> 18:21.082
- Beth's wedding?
- Beth's wedding, right.

18:21.208 --> 18:22.790
Wow. Was a fun night.

18:22.916 --> 18:24.582
I'm foggy.

18:24.708 --> 18:26.957
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, nice to see you as well.

18:30.416 --> 18:31.957
You guys know each other.

18:32.083 --> 18:33.415
Yeah, we fucking live together.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.040
(Clicks tongue) Nice.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.624
How you take a punch, Josh?

18:40.750 --> 18:43.290
- (Coughs) Excuse me?
- I think we should get into a fight.

18:43.416 --> 18:45.874
For the article.
I think it'd be a neat idea.

18:47.541 --> 18:49.457
- Stand up, Josh.
- OK.

18:50.541 --> 18:53.082
- I'm gonna show you how to take a punch.
- I know how to take a punch.

18:53.208 --> 18:54.790
I'm gonna show you the right way
to take a punch.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.082
OK, hit me.

18:56.708 --> 18:58.457
- Where?
- Right in my stomach.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.124
Hit me as hard as you can,
just at my stomach.

19:03.666 --> 19:05.290
That wasn't as hard as I can.

19:05.416 --> 19:06.832
I know. I hope not.

19:06.958 --> 19:08.665
Hit me again.
Harder. Seriously.

19:08.791 --> 19:09.874
- Yeah, OK.
- Go.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.790
- You ready?
- Yeah.

19:11.916 --> 19:13.665
- Harder?
- Go. Harder.

19:16.041 --> 19:17.165
I'm fine.

19:17.291 --> 19:20.207
What I did was essentially,
breathing is key.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.332
- Think of it as, like...
- Just hit me.

19:22.458 --> 19:24.082
- All right, you ready? OK.
- Yeah.

19:24.708 --> 19:26.040
One...

19:26.166 --> 19:27.582
Two...

19:27.708 --> 19:29.749
It's cancelled.
I'm fired, if you can believe that.

19:29.875 --> 19:31.499
The whole damn time,
he had another guy

19:31.625 --> 19:33.999
and was talking to another magazine,
and just goes with that.

19:34.125 --> 19:36.665
It's sociopathic, is what it is.
Fucking snake.

19:36.791 --> 19:38.249
Feel like a real
fat loser right now.

19:38.375 --> 19:41.457
You should use the time
doing something equally as productive.

19:42.208 --> 19:44.749
Well, I was actually planning to stay home
and suffer quietly

19:44.875 --> 19:46.790
as I can no longer afford
to do much else.

19:48.166 --> 19:50.749
Come to my country house.
Stay with me.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.957
Rub two sticks together.

19:54.083 --> 19:55.624
Make a fire.

19:55.750 --> 19:58.290
I know most people expect
surprising and generous offers

19:58.416 --> 19:59.582
to be politely refused,

19:59.708 --> 20:02.040
but I might have to call your bluff
and emphatically accept.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.124
How does Memorial Day sound?

20:05.250 --> 20:06.249
That's next week.

20:06.375 --> 20:08.374
Yeah. Sooner the better.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.499
I have a girl, Melanie, up there.

20:11.625 --> 20:12.915
She looks after the place.

20:13.041 --> 20:14.707
I'll mention it to her.

20:16.750 --> 20:17.749
Thank you.

20:18.541 --> 20:19.540
Skol.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.540
(Narrator) 'Philip had begun to feel
that the city was rejecting him,

20:31.666 --> 20:35.790
'and Ike's sudden offer of solitude and respite
was immediately appealing.

20:35.916 --> 20:39.374
'So much so that Philip even requested
that the invitation be open-ended,

20:39.500 --> 20:43.999
'and that he be allowed to stay until he felt
emotionally capable of returning to the city.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.790
'To Philip's surprise,
Ike considered this a terrific idea,

20:48.916 --> 20:50.540
'and even said so.'

20:50.666 --> 20:52.415
(Ike) Actually, that's a terrific idea.

20:53.333 --> 20:57.374
I admire you for being so bold
as to come right out and ask.

20:57.500 --> 21:00.540
I know that sounds like I'm being sarcastic,
but I'm not.

21:05.041 --> 21:08.415
(Narrator) 'Ike had begun to lose
his passion for being alone all the time,

21:08.541 --> 21:12.915
'and was eager to have an impressionable
young mind on which to impart his wisdom.

21:13.041 --> 21:14.999
'It was under these circumstances
that Philip agreed

21:15.125 --> 21:17.332
'to spend a portion
of his summer upstate with Ike,

21:17.458 --> 21:19.915
'rather than in the city with Ashley.

21:21.708 --> 21:23.332
'Ashley had not been the first to notice

21:23.458 --> 21:26.040
'Philip's increasingly
marginal role in her life.

21:26.166 --> 21:28.540
'It was talked about often
by friends and colleagues,

21:28.666 --> 21:30.707
'none of whom ever had
a relationship with Philip,

21:30.833 --> 21:33.957
'but grew used to hearing about him
much more than they had been lately.

21:37.916 --> 21:41.290
'It had been months since Ashley felt
any real connection to Philip.

21:41.416 --> 21:44.999
'He began to drift away while applying
the finishing touches to his new book

21:45.125 --> 21:46.582
'and had never come back.

21:46.708 --> 21:48.874
'She tried her best to ignore
the mounting signs,

21:49.000 --> 21:50.915
'but the more often they were
brought to her attention,

21:51.041 --> 21:52.540
'the harder it became.

21:52.666 --> 21:55.207
'The most difficult part of which
was her own increasing ambivalence

21:55.333 --> 21:58.415
'regarding her role in Philip's life,
or his in hers.

21:58.958 --> 22:00.290
'She wanted him to want her,

22:00.416 --> 22:02.790
'and the slowly dawning realisation
that he might not

22:02.916 --> 22:05.374
'was enough to push her
into emotionally unprecedented levels

22:05.500 --> 22:07.415
'of doubt and misdirected anger.'

22:10.083 --> 22:12.374
(Ashley) So it's cancelled,
and you're suddenly leaving again?

22:12.500 --> 22:13.749
Looks like it.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.665
God, you'd do anything
to get away from me.

22:15.791 --> 22:18.874
You see, it's remarks like that
that tell me I'm doing the right thing.

22:19.833 --> 22:21.249
Can we please talk?

22:21.375 --> 22:22.624
OK.

22:22.750 --> 22:24.207
Talk.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.582
Kind of figured
you would say something.

22:27.708 --> 22:28.999
(Clicks tongue) Nope.

22:29.666 --> 22:31.040
Actually, I do have something to say,

22:31.166 --> 22:33.374
and I imagine you'll not care to hear it,
and it is this.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.957
I'm not going to Ike's for just the week.
He invited me to stay for longer.

22:38.833 --> 22:40.874
- Wait, longer?
- Yeah.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.749
I don't understand.

22:42.875 --> 22:45.790
Honestly, I don't see myself
returning till July or so.

22:46.541 --> 22:48.332
So, you're basically leaving me
for the whole summer.

22:48.458 --> 22:49.832
Not if you look at it like that.

22:49.958 --> 22:51.790
- How am I supposed to look at it?
- Look at it like this.

22:51.916 --> 22:53.874
I was supposed to be gone
most of June anyway, right?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.124
I don't see how this is any different.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.624
I can't breathe here,

22:56.750 --> 22:58.999
and you seem to resent my presence.
Thus I'm unable to work.

22:59.125 --> 23:01.040
It's ugly. It's loud.
It's always moving.

23:01.166 --> 23:03.540
I never feel still long enough
to hold a thought.

23:03.666 --> 23:04.999
I feel sick out there among the people.

23:05.125 --> 23:07.165
I need to remedy this,
and an opportunity has presented itself.

23:07.291 --> 23:10.124
I'm gonna take it. I've got no money
and no hope of another advance.

23:10.250 --> 23:12.082
I'm doing what's best for me.

23:12.208 --> 23:14.415
Yeah, you're doing
what you're best at.

23:14.541 --> 23:16.457
You're looking out for
your own self interests

23:16.583 --> 23:19.624
without thinking about how it might
affect me or anybody else. Typical!

23:19.750 --> 23:21.582
You're hardly around anyway.
You won't even notice.

23:21.708 --> 23:24.999
Hey, don't tell me I'm not gonna notice
that I'm alone all of a sudden.

23:26.916 --> 23:28.915
Why can't you do something
that involves me?

23:29.041 --> 23:31.624
Why can't we go somewhere together?
You know, alone or...

23:33.875 --> 23:36.332
Is it the money? Because I don't mind
if you need to borrow some again...

23:36.458 --> 23:37.457
Put your money away, all right?

23:37.583 --> 23:38.874
I'm not taking any money from you.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.749
Those days are behind me.
Forever, I told myself.

23:41.958 --> 23:44.124
I hope this will be good for us.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.624
But especially for me.

24:05.416 --> 24:08.124
You are selfish and unsentimental.

24:08.875 --> 24:11.874
- Everyone knows this about you.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.332
On the contrary.

24:13.458 --> 24:16.749
An admirable trait, if you ask me.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.665
I come from
an unsupportive background.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.832
Yeah, I do, too,
but don't cling to it.

24:21.958 --> 24:23.415
It'll make you lazy and angry.

24:23.541 --> 24:25.790
- Your work will suffer.
- I'll keep that in mind.

24:25.916 --> 24:29.415
And I don't believe you need to
exacerbate these instincts in yourself

24:29.541 --> 24:30.540
more than you already do.

24:33.416 --> 24:34.415
You got it.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.915
(Tyres screech, car horn beeps)

24:44.833 --> 24:46.540
(♪ Music playing on radio)

25:05.791 --> 25:07.749
Ah... now, your room's out the back.

25:24.291 --> 25:25.707
I, erm...

25:26.250 --> 25:28.457
I have to go to the city
for a couple of days.

25:28.583 --> 25:31.790
- Do you think you'll be all right here?
- Yes, I do.

25:31.916 --> 25:33.249
I thought so.

26:01.750 --> 26:03.249
(Door opens)

26:04.541 --> 26:05.540
Hello?

26:06.291 --> 26:07.749
Dad?

26:09.083 --> 26:10.124
(Philip) Hello?

26:12.875 --> 26:14.290
Are you that kid?

26:15.458 --> 26:17.290
You're the caretaker, Melanie?

26:17.416 --> 26:19.124
Dad mentioned you might be here.

26:19.250 --> 26:20.790
So, this comes as no surprise.

26:20.916 --> 26:22.624
Not to me, no.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.082
"Dad"?

26:35.000 --> 26:36.624
Beautiful sunset.

26:39.791 --> 26:42.165
- Productive day?
- Not particularly.

26:43.416 --> 26:46.082
I'm glad that he's replaced himself
with a younger surrogate

26:46.208 --> 26:47.665
to handle the forlorn moping.

26:49.583 --> 26:51.790
I'm glad it pleases you.

26:53.291 --> 26:54.874
He'll be back in a few days.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.499
I know.

26:57.041 --> 27:00.457
I wasn't sure if you cared about
me being here and him not.

27:00.583 --> 27:02.415
- I do not.
- Right.

27:02.541 --> 27:04.290
Because you are a guest.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.457
And this is probably
your summer home.

27:11.583 --> 27:14.540
He used to bring other women here
so he could cheat on my mother.

27:17.166 --> 27:18.332
So, no family vacations.

27:18.458 --> 27:20.332
Only horrible, traumatic ones.

27:22.291 --> 27:23.832
(Birds chirping)

27:25.416 --> 27:27.165
(Lawnmower)

27:50.916 --> 27:52.290
(Engine stops)

27:53.833 --> 27:55.749
You never smell cut grass in the city.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.499
I don't find you charming.

27:57.625 --> 28:00.749
You are just like him, and I hope you learn
to take responsibility for yourself

28:00.875 --> 28:03.457
before you destroy the lives
of people who care about you.

28:09.625 --> 28:11.207
(Strains)

28:19.250 --> 28:20.749
This is really nice.

28:21.458 --> 28:22.874
Thanks, Dad.

28:24.291 --> 28:25.957
So, how's it been up here?

28:27.291 --> 28:28.540
It's been good.

28:28.666 --> 28:30.707
I've really enjoyed
all the alone time.

28:32.541 --> 28:34.457
I'm sorry about
the scheduling problem.

28:34.583 --> 28:36.790
Will you admit
that you made a mistake?

28:36.916 --> 28:38.499
I don't think that's necessary.

28:38.625 --> 28:40.915
It was a simple misunderstanding.

28:41.041 --> 28:42.499
Could happen to anyone.

28:43.791 --> 28:45.124
Was anybody speaking to you?

28:45.250 --> 28:47.915
- I thought I was part of the conversation.
- Well, you weren't supposed to be.

28:48.041 --> 28:50.040
In fact, you're not even
supposed to be here.

28:50.166 --> 28:51.540
I am. Does that make sense?

28:51.666 --> 28:54.415
You are the scheduling problem
I was referring to.

28:54.541 --> 28:57.332
I thought you were talking about
how your father had to go back to the city.

28:57.458 --> 28:59.624
- Yeah, I thought so too.
- Well, I wasn't.

28:59.750 --> 29:01.332
You didn't make that clear,
sweetheart.

29:06.958 --> 29:10.665
I can't process how grossly dissatisfied
I find myself feeling.

29:10.791 --> 29:14.249
Things I've coveted for years are mine now,
and all I feel is miserable.

29:14.375 --> 29:16.749
(Chuckles) That is so cliché.

29:16.875 --> 29:20.082
But you know that, so I won't bother
reminding you of how silly you sound.

29:20.875 --> 29:23.957
Didn't you say you, erm...
you placed on some

29:24.083 --> 29:26.499
silly list of young so-and-so's?

29:26.625 --> 29:27.915
35 under 35.

29:28.041 --> 29:29.457
That's it. Yeah.

29:29.583 --> 29:32.165
Yeah, we didn't have crap like that
when I was your age.

29:32.291 --> 29:33.707
You're ahead of the game.

29:33.833 --> 29:36.999
Yeah, but when you were 32,
didn't you win the National Book Award?

29:38.750 --> 29:40.332
That's true.

29:40.458 --> 29:42.832
But you are not me.

29:46.250 --> 29:49.499
How would you like to accept
a gracious favour I've done for you?

29:50.958 --> 29:52.082
Depends on what it is.

29:52.833 --> 29:57.332
That answer is at once
both arrogant and correct.

29:57.458 --> 30:00.832
Don't accept too readily
something you might want.

30:01.708 --> 30:05.540
In any event, a friend of mine
from Lambert College got in touch.

30:05.666 --> 30:08.999
They're looking for an
adjunct creative writing instructor

30:09.125 --> 30:10.415
for the fall semester.

30:10.541 --> 30:12.415
I teach there occasionally,
as you know,

30:12.541 --> 30:15.374
but usually more advanced seminars, so...

30:16.291 --> 30:18.165
I find this to be beneath me,

30:18.291 --> 30:20.499
but it's a good opportunity for you.

30:21.416 --> 30:22.790
He'd like to interview you tomorrow.

30:23.500 --> 30:25.415
- You can take my car.
- What does it pay?

30:25.541 --> 30:27.124
At that level, I have no idea.

30:27.250 --> 30:29.874
But, hey, you haven't got
the position yet.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.374
I've merely placed you
on their radar.

30:33.375 --> 30:36.207
But you're notable now,
and that helps.

30:38.916 --> 30:40.957
We're so excited you accepted.

30:41.583 --> 30:43.457
The new book is really terrific.

30:44.583 --> 30:45.999
Oh, boy.

30:56.083 --> 30:58.124
I wish somebody here
would say something mean.

30:58.250 --> 30:59.540
- Mean?
- Or honest.

30:59.666 --> 31:02.582
It's unlikely that everybody here
has nothing but praise.

31:02.708 --> 31:05.415
It's not real.
I don't like how this is starting.

31:05.541 --> 31:07.165
These are decent people.

31:07.291 --> 31:08.957
(Mockingly)
They just want to be your friend.

31:09.083 --> 31:10.332
I know, that's the problem.

31:10.458 --> 31:11.874
Sorry to bother you again.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.832
- Is there trash in here?
- Yes, I'm right here.

31:13.958 --> 31:15.540
(Laughs)

31:34.458 --> 31:35.999
Hey.

31:36.125 --> 31:37.832
It's Philip.

31:54.583 --> 31:56.915
You look like you're asleep
with your eyes open.

31:58.458 --> 31:59.999
I didn't even see you there.

32:00.125 --> 32:01.790
You were looking right at me.

32:03.875 --> 32:06.040
You were right.
This place is beautiful.

32:08.208 --> 32:09.999
You sure you don't want
any of these?

32:10.125 --> 32:12.457
Brought you a whole box.

32:12.583 --> 32:15.124
I'd rather just look around
and stare at people.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.290
I was surprised you called me.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.832
I didn't see any way
that I couldn't.

32:24.666 --> 32:27.582
Things are pretty hectic
with my new book and everything.

32:27.708 --> 32:29.540
That's pretty cool.

32:31.083 --> 32:33.749
No, it's not cool.
It's fucking amazing.

32:33.875 --> 32:35.957
Do you know how few people
reach this level?

32:38.208 --> 32:39.457
You seem to not care.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.249
I really don't.

32:44.916 --> 32:47.374
Did you ask me here
so you could talk about yourself?

32:48.458 --> 32:49.957
Next question.

32:51.375 --> 32:53.874
Does talking about this stuff
make you feel happy?

32:54.666 --> 32:55.874
No.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.540
I find thinking about it all
to be unfulfilling and exhausting.

32:59.666 --> 33:00.832
Does nothing for me.

33:00.958 --> 33:03.207
Well, that's how the rest of your life
is gonna be.

33:03.333 --> 33:04.999
Unfulfilling and exhausting.

33:06.291 --> 33:08.290
I think success has made you ugly.

33:09.333 --> 33:12.332
I think you've gotten far too in touch
with your selfish instincts,

33:12.458 --> 33:13.999
and it's not healthy.

33:16.083 --> 33:17.957
But I still think about you.

33:18.875 --> 33:21.999
I think the guy I used to know
would have made a really great boyfriend.

33:23.041 --> 33:24.999
I want to take that cupcake
out of your hand right now

33:25.125 --> 33:27.415
and throw it
so fucking far away from you.

33:28.041 --> 33:31.457
Goddamn it, you make me sick.
You're just a big baby.

33:31.583 --> 33:34.457
Babies wanna be around sugar all the time.
No wonder you're a baker.

33:35.333 --> 33:36.374
You're the worst.

33:36.916 --> 33:39.374
I'm not successful, I'm notable.
There's a difference.

33:40.125 --> 33:41.415
Besides, I'm not notable, either.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.124
Noteworthy at best.

33:45.166 --> 33:47.415
I once considered you
my favourite ex-girlfriend.

33:48.291 --> 33:49.957
That's very sweet of you.

33:51.916 --> 33:54.582
Let's... let's turn this day around,
do something fun.

33:54.708 --> 33:57.082
Maybe, I don't know,
break into a bank,

33:57.208 --> 33:58.415
or rob a car or something.

33:58.541 --> 33:59.874
- All right, let's do it.
- Let's do it.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.624
Got some wire hangers at my place.

34:01.750 --> 34:04.665
Oh, great, well, let's steal a car,
go to your place, get the wire hangers,

34:04.791 --> 34:06.457
come back, steal another car,
and just drive off.

34:06.583 --> 34:07.582
OK.

34:07.708 --> 34:09.790
I feel like it wouldn't be weird
for you to kiss me right now.

34:21.625 --> 34:25.331
Every girl's so beautiful to me.
I don't wanna think about her at all anymore.

34:25.458 --> 34:27.540
- You should have followed her.
- She wouldn't have me.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.206
And besides, she's moved on.

34:30.333 --> 34:32.331
And in a way, so have I.

34:33.333 --> 34:35.331
Just not actually, of course.

34:40.375 --> 34:44.248
Well, I speak from experience
when I say that it is horrible...

34:45.708 --> 34:49.331
to be treated in a way that only points out
how meaningless you are.

34:56.166 --> 34:57.832
Never thought of it that way.

35:15.416 --> 35:17.332
(♪ Indie dance music playing)

35:18.875 --> 35:20.540
He's here.

35:20.666 --> 35:22.749
(Man) Yeah, he just walked
into your bedroom.

35:33.666 --> 35:35.124
Oh, hey, how's it goin'?

35:42.083 --> 35:43.749
You're a monster.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.624
I hate you.

35:45.750 --> 35:48.499
Then I doubt you'll mind me
being gone through December.

35:50.208 --> 35:52.415
I don't even know
how to respond to that.

35:52.541 --> 35:55.332
I've been offered a position teaching
creative writing at Lambert College.

35:55.458 --> 35:57.290
I'm moving there for the semester.

36:02.416 --> 36:05.207
You stood in my way
when I had so many opportunities.

36:07.291 --> 36:09.457
I guess that's why I'm telling you about this
after I agreed to it.

36:09.583 --> 36:12.499
So you decided to sneak back
in the middle of the night?

36:12.625 --> 36:15.374
It's not the middle of the night, Ashley.
It's 10:00pm.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.332
Besides, I had some meetings
in the city that ran late,

36:18.458 --> 36:19.915
and I considered
just buying new clothes,

36:20.041 --> 36:22.207
but I needed to get some books
I wanted to re-read.

36:22.333 --> 36:23.999
Also, I want my car.

36:26.666 --> 36:28.457
Oh, shit, I forgot about the car.

36:29.625 --> 36:31.790
You haven't been moving it
for street cleaning?

36:31.916 --> 36:35.207
I've been gone for three weeks.
Do you know how many tickets I must have?

36:35.333 --> 36:36.665
(Tuts)

36:44.750 --> 36:47.124
I kind of would have thought
this to be beneath you.

36:47.250 --> 36:50.290
You know, at one time
I would have as well,

36:50.416 --> 36:51.790
but look at me now.

36:54.291 --> 36:56.040
- You're a man of contradictions.
- No, I'm not.

36:56.166 --> 36:57.749
Who are all these assholes?

36:58.458 --> 36:59.832
They're my friends.

36:59.958 --> 37:01.457
"They're my friends."

37:03.791 --> 37:05.124
Mostly.

37:07.791 --> 37:10.165
I got this job, this...

37:12.083 --> 37:14.124
This national ad campaign, so...

37:15.750 --> 37:17.249
We're celebrating.

37:21.416 --> 37:22.915
That's great.

37:23.041 --> 37:25.082
(Narrator) 'Philip wished
Ashley had not reminded him

37:25.208 --> 37:27.332
'of how great it felt
to be proud of her.

37:27.458 --> 37:29.457
'His own relationship with success
had forced him

37:29.583 --> 37:32.499
'to grow out of feeling resentful
towards her accomplishments.

37:32.625 --> 37:35.707
'He was not prepared to lose
that constant stream of enthusiasm.'

37:37.083 --> 37:39.040
You see?
You don't even need me.

37:44.458 --> 37:47.374
God, you really
believe that, don't you?

37:47.500 --> 37:50.290
I'm not sure how to answer that
without making things worse.

37:52.458 --> 37:54.999
I supported you when
nobody gave a shit about you.

37:59.166 --> 38:01.249
I want you to know
I regret that now.

38:03.500 --> 38:04.707
Good.

38:05.958 --> 38:08.249
(Ashley) I don't wanna
talk to you anymore.

38:10.666 --> 38:15.957
So you can just...
you can be somebody else's charity case.

38:16.083 --> 38:19.457
- Maybe Zimmerman will take care of you.
- He already has, and he will gladly continue.

38:19.583 --> 38:21.040
Get out of my house.

38:21.166 --> 38:22.499
My house too.

38:22.625 --> 38:25.165
No. It was never your house.
You just lived here.

38:25.291 --> 38:27.415
You know, I'd like to hope
that in a few months' time,

38:27.541 --> 38:28.874
we'll both have
some perspective on this

38:29.000 --> 38:30.957
and be able to move somewhere,
like forward.

38:39.000 --> 38:40.540
This feels irreparable.

38:41.250 --> 38:43.249
You accusing me of indifference?

38:48.916 --> 38:50.415
You don't seem to be struggling.

38:51.791 --> 38:53.040
I am.

38:53.166 --> 38:54.749
Just not in the ways that you notice.

39:03.625 --> 39:05.082
You need a haircut.

39:08.166 --> 39:09.415
I know.

39:20.041 --> 39:21.499
(Door closes)

39:31.291 --> 39:33.499
I'm pretty sure
I'm missing a brush.

39:34.125 --> 39:36.249
I'll bet one of those models
yoinked it.

39:39.416 --> 39:40.874
You got any plans tonight?

39:47.833 --> 39:50.957
Just gonna stay in,
or are you going out?

39:53.166 --> 39:55.415
We were together
for almost three years.

39:58.041 --> 40:00.832
Do you want to come over?
We were just gonna make dinner at home.

40:00.958 --> 40:02.624
You should come.

40:02.750 --> 40:04.540
No, thanks.
I don't want to be a burden.

40:04.666 --> 40:06.374
You're not being a burden.

40:06.500 --> 40:10.624
I couldn't tell him anything
without him getting depressed and jealous.

40:12.875 --> 40:14.415
Now he's gone.

40:15.250 --> 40:16.540
He owes me a lot of money.

40:16.666 --> 40:19.499
You know, when he was writing
and had no income.

40:19.625 --> 40:21.499
Thousands of dollars.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.540
I don't mean to bring you into it.
I just...

40:27.416 --> 40:29.957
I don't think dinner tonight's
a good idea.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.749
No, it's not a good idea at all.

40:39.125 --> 40:40.540
I'm allergic to cats.

40:40.666 --> 40:42.374
Can we just, like, put them down
until you're ready?

40:42.958 --> 40:46.040
No, 'cause then
they're likely to run away.

40:46.166 --> 40:48.499
And then where are we?
Stuck with no cats.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.165
Is everything OK?

41:03.458 --> 41:05.374
What is this cat's name?

41:06.375 --> 41:08.249
This little guy is called Prescott.

41:09.375 --> 41:11.040
That was my grandfather's name.

41:15.750 --> 41:20.290
(Narrator) 'For the first time in years,
Ashley found herself feeling truly alone.

41:20.416 --> 41:22.915
'Despite being surrounded
by people most of every day,

41:23.041 --> 41:26.249
'she was unable to connect to them
in a way she considered meaningful

41:26.375 --> 41:29.165
'and found herself passing through their lives,
and her own,

41:29.291 --> 41:31.124
'in a state of total isolation.

41:50.625 --> 41:51.957
What size are these shirts?

41:52.083 --> 41:55.290
I don't know. Small or medium.
Try it on.

41:55.416 --> 41:57.624
I'll give you
an ill-fitting discount.

41:57.750 --> 41:59.207
They seem expensive.

41:59.333 --> 42:00.582
Sold to the highest bidder.

42:01.708 --> 42:03.540
- This too.
- Yeah, why not?

42:03.666 --> 42:06.249
This? Throw this in.

42:06.375 --> 42:08.874
It's not very good,
but you can use it as a coaster or something.

42:10.333 --> 42:11.874
No good. Naw.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.957
Take the jacket too.
Two for one.

42:14.083 --> 42:15.832
Look at that.

42:15.958 --> 42:17.415
You would date that man, right?

42:18.750 --> 42:19.749
Yeah.

42:30.166 --> 42:32.082
(♪ Club music playing)

42:46.375 --> 42:48.915
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

42:56.458 --> 42:58.624
- You're late.
- Yeah.

42:58.750 --> 43:00.457
- It's OK.
- Yeah.

43:01.125 --> 43:03.040
You lost? Goddamn it.

43:03.916 --> 43:06.790
Well, at least there's one pinball player
in the family.

43:06.916 --> 43:08.040
(Laughs)

43:09.416 --> 43:11.165
- That's a triple take.
- Yeah?

43:12.625 --> 43:14.082
Is that with the spin?

43:15.416 --> 43:17.249
You do that...
Wait, let me try.

43:18.500 --> 43:20.249
- You missed mine.
- Let me see it again.

43:20.375 --> 43:22.832
I was... We were both double-taking
at the same time.

43:23.750 --> 43:26.957
Hey, that was three.
That was pretty good. That was good.

43:27.083 --> 43:28.249
Erm...

43:28.375 --> 43:30.207
What do you get
if you cut a bra in half?

43:30.333 --> 43:33.332
- (Chuckles) What?
- A yarmulke with a chin strap.

43:33.458 --> 43:35.374
- (Man) Can you guys keep it down, please?
- What?

43:35.500 --> 43:37.499
Can you please keep it down?

43:37.625 --> 43:39.999
How dare you tell me to keep it down?
I'm here with my better half here.

43:40.125 --> 43:41.207
Go fuck yourself!

43:41.333 --> 43:43.790
You can't come into my place
where I'm with my friends,

43:43.916 --> 43:46.374
drinking, playing pinball,
having a fun time, celebrating.

43:46.500 --> 43:48.749
You're not welcome.
Get out of here.

43:48.875 --> 43:50.207
Get the fuck out of here!

43:50.333 --> 43:53.124
I'm not kidding you.
Get the fuck out of here right now.

43:53.250 --> 43:55.165
I hate that man.

43:55.958 --> 43:57.415
(Man) Hey, sweetheart.

44:00.958 --> 44:02.332
What?

44:02.458 --> 44:03.749
What are you staring at?

44:04.958 --> 44:05.957
Nothing.

44:06.708 --> 44:08.749
- Nothing?
- Thought I smelled gasoline.

44:09.583 --> 44:10.832
That's me.

44:11.458 --> 44:13.457
- You look lost.
- I'm not.

44:13.583 --> 44:14.915
Wanna come hang out?

44:20.916 --> 44:22.999
- You want something to drink?
- Sure.

44:23.125 --> 44:24.624
All right, sit down.

44:32.333 --> 44:34.874
(Narrator) 'When she had first spoken to
the lowlife at the bar,

44:35.000 --> 44:38.874
'it was the first time in four days
Ashley heard her own voice out loud.

44:41.250 --> 44:45.082
'She became devastatingly aware of
her own desperation, loneliness and torment.

44:45.875 --> 44:48.415
'Quickly she could take no more
and went home.'

45:36.416 --> 45:37.832
This is a no-kill shelter.

We have plenty of available
foster parents

45:40.875 --> 45:45.332
who are able to take care of them
for as long as necessary to find a home.

45:49.875 --> 45:51.874
- Do you have any cats?
- What?

45:52.000 --> 45:54.040
Cats! Do you have any cats?

46:01.791 --> 46:04.457
This guy is really friendly.
Loving.

46:07.875 --> 46:10.874
Do you have any
black and white ones?

46:11.000 --> 46:15.207
Like, that resemble a panda?
Or a raccoon?

46:15.333 --> 46:16.915
You really care about the colour.

46:17.041 --> 46:18.749
Yeah, kind of.

46:25.333 --> 46:27.374
(Mechanical voicebox) He chooses you.

46:30.166 --> 46:32.957
You want a snack?
Do you want a snack?

46:33.083 --> 46:34.582
This is your new home.

46:35.708 --> 46:36.915
What do you think?

46:37.583 --> 46:39.582
There we go. Get familiar.

46:43.500 --> 46:45.457
OK, come on. Ready?

46:45.583 --> 46:47.082
Ready to find your bed?

46:51.291 --> 46:52.499
What do you think?

47:19.125 --> 47:20.665
- Hey!
- Hey!

47:23.500 --> 47:25.290
- Hey, you're here.
- I'm here.

47:25.416 --> 47:27.832
- How was your trip?
- Ugh, I feel sick.

47:27.958 --> 47:30.082
- You feel sick?
- Yeah. Oh, it's a beautiful day.

47:30.208 --> 47:31.207
Right?

47:38.041 --> 47:39.040
Place looks good.

47:39.166 --> 47:41.374
I'm excited you finally
get to see our renovations.

47:42.375 --> 47:44.207
Can't believe that excites you.

47:44.333 --> 47:46.582
God, you sound like a brat
who lives in a dump in New York.

47:47.375 --> 47:49.582
Don't be shitty.
My house is not a dump.

47:50.500 --> 47:52.415
Wouldn't know.
I've never been.

47:54.666 --> 47:56.499
Lots of fights happened in this room.

47:57.916 --> 47:59.082
Only with you.

48:05.333 --> 48:06.457
We're going out.

48:06.583 --> 48:07.915
Get yourself dressed up.

48:09.625 --> 48:11.790
It's gonna be a big night. (Laughs)

48:33.583 --> 48:35.332
OK, could you stop doing that?
It's really annoying.

48:35.458 --> 48:36.957
I planned on going away for a week.

48:37.083 --> 48:38.624
- You know this is important to me.
- I know,

48:38.750 --> 48:40.290
but it wasn't supposed
to start for 10 days.

48:40.416 --> 48:41.999
They changed it.
I don't know what to tell you.

48:42.125 --> 48:44.165
You're not being really
supportive right now.

48:44.291 --> 48:46.165
You know this is
an amazing opportunity for me.

48:46.291 --> 48:48.624
Tell me the good version
of this conversation.

48:52.625 --> 48:53.665
"You got the job?

48:53.791 --> 48:56.207
"Congratulations, Ashley.
I'm so happy for you.

48:56.333 --> 48:58.540
"Although I admit to being
a little disappointed,

48:58.666 --> 49:00.582
"I understand that
these things happen.

49:00.708 --> 49:02.665
"I'm so proud of you, baby."

49:03.250 --> 49:04.624
That's basically what I said.

49:05.416 --> 49:06.874
I would never say that.

49:08.583 --> 49:10.124
I am proud of you.

49:13.333 --> 49:14.582
Come here.

49:14.708 --> 49:16.165
I wish you wanted to go out.

49:17.500 --> 49:19.374
I am out. I don't live here.

49:22.666 --> 49:23.874
Oh, I adopted a cat.

49:24.000 --> 49:25.749
I know.
You send me pictures.

49:26.333 --> 49:28.374
I send them
or I sent them once?

49:28.500 --> 49:31.874
- Oh, more than once.
- I think I'm going to name my cat Gadzookey.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.957
You have a little situation there.
With your...

49:35.791 --> 49:37.374
Oh.

49:39.208 --> 49:40.582
I love him.

49:41.625 --> 49:42.999
You should love a human.

49:49.958 --> 49:54.124
I just don't want him to be one of those exes
I have to see every few years.

49:54.250 --> 49:55.249
You know?

49:56.041 --> 49:57.749
He's making it really easy.

50:00.083 --> 50:02.374
I hate that you think this is easy.

50:02.500 --> 50:03.790
That's nice.

50:06.375 --> 50:09.249
- Should I do anything?
- No, no, no, just look that way.

50:10.208 --> 50:11.707
There you go. Smile.

50:11.833 --> 50:12.832
(Camera shutter clicks)

50:12.958 --> 50:14.999
Think of something funny.

50:16.250 --> 50:17.582
Nice.

50:19.791 --> 50:21.040
There you go.

50:21.958 --> 50:23.082
It's me.

50:23.208 --> 50:24.999
Work it. Work it.

50:25.125 --> 50:27.207
Classic, but not a comedy.

50:28.416 --> 50:29.957
And he got 'em all!

50:31.333 --> 50:33.749
- You want another one?
- Not another banana joke.

50:33.875 --> 50:35.124
Can I take one of you?

50:35.708 --> 50:37.624
- So, you pull the thing back?
- Oh, it looks nice, yeah.

50:37.750 --> 50:40.665
- Did it click?
- Yeah. Smile a little.

50:40.791 --> 50:42.040
I don't feel like smiling.

50:43.208 --> 50:45.707
- Focus up there. You all right?
- I'm getting addicted to this.

50:45.833 --> 50:48.207
It's gonna be a bit fuzzy,
I have a feeling.

50:48.333 --> 50:51.165
- There you go. Turn that thing, don't be shy.
- They're art house.

53:39.500 --> 53:41.832
'without being preoccupied
by thoughts of him.

53:42.916 --> 53:45.874
'Once, when she failed to keep him
out of her mind,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.040
'Ashley decided to uncover
and finally read

53:48.166 --> 53:51.374
'the short stories Philip had written
while in college and shortly thereafter,

53:51.500 --> 53:53.082
'before they had met.

53:57.250 --> 53:59.374
'She was sad to discover
that the stories were,

53:59.500 --> 54:00.832
'as Philip had always promised,

54:00.958 --> 54:03.249
'not of any remarkable quality.

54:03.375 --> 54:07.082
'Ashley felt her final remaining vestiges
of admiration for Philip slipping away,

54:07.208 --> 54:10.957
'although she respected his progression
from these to his recent work.

54:11.833 --> 54:15.832
'Ashley wondered if Philip's first novel
would have excited her as much as it once did

54:15.958 --> 54:18.290
'if she had read these stories
when they first met.

54:21.166 --> 54:22.374
'Following this episode,

54:22.500 --> 54:25.874
'Ashley put the stories and Philip away
for as long as she could manage.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.457
'By this point, the truth was

54:27.583 --> 54:30.374
'that she had no idea of
what he had been doing all summer,

54:30.500 --> 54:33.207
'nor was it of any pressing concern to her.

54:34.500 --> 54:37.540
'Ashley's dedication to carrying on
with early autumn traditions,

54:37.666 --> 54:39.290
'ones formerly enjoyed with Philip,

54:39.416 --> 54:41.874
'did much to distract her
from the shifting of seasons

54:42.000 --> 54:44.749
'and all the connected feelings
that could come along with it.

54:44.875 --> 54:47.332
'Her dedication to normalcy
allowed Ashley to stave off

54:47.458 --> 54:49.915
'a seasonally-augmented
sense of melancholy,

54:50.041 --> 54:52.165
'which prevented her
from regressing back to the darkness

54:52.291 --> 54:54.290
'she had completely left behind.

54:56.750 --> 54:58.999
'Yearning for intimate interaction
detached from her work

54:59.125 --> 55:00.707
'and regular circle of friends,

55:00.833 --> 55:03.624
'and needing to spend an evening away
from Gadzookey the cat,

55:03.750 --> 55:06.124
'to whom she had discovered
she was mildly allergic,

55:06.250 --> 55:09.374
'Ashley made social plans
with her ex-boyfriend Peter.

55:09.500 --> 55:12.582
'They had dated for just under two years
prior to her meeting Philip,

55:12.708 --> 55:14.207
'and seldom saw one another,

55:14.333 --> 55:17.707
'so the invitation came to him
as something of a surprise.

55:17.833 --> 55:19.790
'The ease with which
their conversation flowed

55:19.916 --> 55:23.540
'made her further disdain Philip
for not only the void he had left in her life,

55:23.666 --> 55:27.082
'but also the energy she had decided
he routinely drained from it,

55:27.208 --> 55:29.665
'which she now felt being
slowly breathed back in.'

55:31.125 --> 55:32.415
You didn't talk about him at all.

55:34.041 --> 55:35.499
Got nothing to say.

55:37.083 --> 55:38.207
How is he?

55:38.333 --> 55:40.999
I did so well.
Can you not ask?

55:41.583 --> 55:43.040
Please.

55:43.875 --> 55:45.624
Thank you.

55:47.208 --> 55:49.457
I feel him weighing on me
more in his absence,

55:49.583 --> 55:51.249
than I did when he was around.

55:52.166 --> 55:53.749
Where is he?

55:54.583 --> 55:56.082
He's just gone.

55:57.416 --> 55:59.665
It's like he was a figment
of my imagination.

56:14.166 --> 56:16.749
(Philip) I'm fairly certain
I'm not welcome here.

56:16.875 --> 56:18.165
Ding-ding-ding.

56:18.291 --> 56:21.665
It's late. I've been sitting here
waiting to make a scene for hours.

56:21.791 --> 56:23.374
What do you want?

56:23.500 --> 56:24.874
I'm very lonely.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.624
That's unfortunate.

56:26.750 --> 56:29.790
I don't like teaching creative writing
as much as I assumed I would.

56:29.916 --> 56:31.457
Well, you're a cruel, miserable person,

56:31.583 --> 56:33.999
so it makes sense you'd end up
in a miserable situation.

56:34.125 --> 56:35.915
What happened to my desk?

56:36.666 --> 56:38.082
That's my bonus desk.

56:39.291 --> 56:41.832
- Nobody at the school likes me.
- Nobody here likes you.

56:41.958 --> 56:44.124
I think I might resign
and come home.

56:45.125 --> 56:47.124
(Mumbling) You don't live here.

56:48.041 --> 56:49.582
You live upstate.

56:49.708 --> 56:51.249
No, I don't want that
to be my home.

56:51.375 --> 56:54.790
It's lonely and sad
and the faculty have turned on me.

56:54.916 --> 56:57.790
Boo-hoo! The last few weeks
have been so hard for you.

56:58.375 --> 56:59.374
Whose cat is this?

57:02.500 --> 57:04.082
It's my cat.

57:04.208 --> 57:06.624
- We don't have a cat.
- Apparently I do.

57:07.625 --> 57:09.832
Oh, look, see? There it is.

57:09.958 --> 57:11.790
Come here, big boy.

57:11.916 --> 57:13.624
This is Gadzookey.

57:13.750 --> 57:15.874
Gadzookey, meet Philip.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.332
Don't get attached.
He was just leaving.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.249
Do you ever make a decision
that at the time seems sound,

57:24.375 --> 57:26.582
but quickly reveals itself
to be empty?

57:26.708 --> 57:28.749
Good-bye, Philip.
I don't like you.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.457
He's kind of an asshole.

57:35.291 --> 57:37.165
What a strange feeling.

57:37.291 --> 57:39.582
So off ‒
it's like my head is a car,

57:39.708 --> 57:42.207
but I can't drive fast
because there's too much traffic.

57:42.333 --> 57:46.999
So instead I'm just
moving very, very slowly.

57:47.916 --> 57:49.665
It's so hard, what I do.

57:49.791 --> 57:52.165
I mean, it's not at all,
and that is the joke, right?

57:52.916 --> 57:55.290
- (Sighs) God, this is so boring.
- A big joke.

57:55.416 --> 57:56.790
Ashley's so bored right now.

57:56.916 --> 57:58.915
Just go back where you came from.

57:59.041 --> 58:01.499
I'm getting angry at myself,
do you understand?

58:01.625 --> 58:04.832
Because it doesn't even upset me
to see you like this.

58:04.958 --> 58:06.999
I want you to leave
and leave me alone.

58:07.125 --> 58:10.624
I don't know why you are here,
but I'm not interested, so don't tell me.

58:10.750 --> 58:13.374
God, do you remember
there was a time when we just...

58:13.500 --> 58:16.707
We wanted to go to sleep together
and wake up together,

58:16.833 --> 58:18.874
every day, indefinitely.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.124
Now I don't even give a shit
if I ever see you again.

58:21.250 --> 58:23.457
I want you to leave,
and just don't come back

58:23.583 --> 58:25.249
and stop hurting me.

58:30.500 --> 58:32.957
I got asked to write a short story
about photography.

58:33.666 --> 58:35.207
By who?

58:36.333 --> 58:38.207
Oh, God, you'd be so mad if I told you.

58:38.333 --> 58:40.290
Isn't that what you want?

58:42.833 --> 58:44.707
I don't know what
you want me to say.

58:45.500 --> 58:47.582
You used to be so exciting.

58:48.458 --> 58:49.999
Now you're just pitiful.

58:53.416 --> 58:56.582
(Clicks tongue) I'm afraid you've seen
the last of me for a long, long time.

58:56.708 --> 58:57.915
(Ashley chuckles)

59:02.916 --> 59:04.415
(Door closes)

59:24.000 --> 59:25.499
(Exhales)

59:41.000 --> 59:42.915
(Door opens)

59:43.583 --> 59:45.415
- Hey.
- I know you.

59:46.083 --> 59:47.249
Do you know where he is?

59:47.791 --> 59:48.790
I don't.

59:50.958 --> 59:52.749
Do you, like, live here now?

59:52.875 --> 59:54.165
I still have the keys.

59:54.750 --> 59:57.874
No, now I live
in a depressing faculty apartment.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.165
How is the college?

59:59.291 --> 01:00:00.665
It's fine.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:02.999
I assumed he'd be here.

01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:05.374
- Seems I was mistaken.
- Yeah, that makes two of us.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.874
Hey, you can stay
if you want to.

01:00:10.083 --> 01:00:11.707
That won't be necessary.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.457
(Narrator)
'For reasons unclear to him,

01:00:14.583 --> 01:00:17.749
'the exchange with Melanie
caused overwhelming anxiety in Philip,

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:19.499
'who had driven through the night
to get here.

01:00:20.791 --> 01:00:24.374
'In the weeks he had spent living with Ike,
when Melanie was not around,

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.290
'she was never brought up
in conversation.

01:00:26.416 --> 01:00:27.707
'Philip would have forgotten about her,

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:29.665
'had it not been for
the smattering of photographs

01:00:29.791 --> 01:00:32.332
'that still remained in the guest room
where he slept.

01:00:33.041 --> 01:00:34.582
'Sitting meekly on the couch,

01:00:34.708 --> 01:00:38.999
'Melanie embodied the high cost of isolation
and detachment from loved ones.

01:00:39.125 --> 01:00:40.832
'Unable to stand it any longer,

01:00:40.958 --> 01:00:44.290
'Philip excused himself and returned
to his pitiful life at the college.'

01:00:44.416 --> 01:00:45.999
Tell him I was here.

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:04.957
Your little protégé
stopped by yesterday.

01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:08.249
He's not a protégé, he's a...
He's a friend.

01:01:08.375 --> 01:01:11.332
I still haven't read his book.
I couldn't find it anywhere.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.749
My copy is in the city.

01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:16.582
Should I read it?

01:01:16.708 --> 01:01:19.124
Well, it is remarkable.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.915
He suffers a little
from being too arrogant,

01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:26.207
both in his writing
and as a person.

01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:28.999
Oh. Match made in heaven.

01:01:36.041 --> 01:01:38.874
I don't know if I can continue
to accommodate you here.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.124
Why is that?

01:01:46.583 --> 01:01:48.332
Because you're a pain in the ass.

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:56.749
I have to go to the city today.

01:01:57.916 --> 01:01:59.290
What for?

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:00.915
See my agent.

01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:05.165
- Henry?
- Henry? No.

01:02:05.291 --> 01:02:07.415
Henry's not been with me
for 10 years.

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:09.582
Why not?

01:02:09.708 --> 01:02:12.665
Because he's a cocksucker
and a little piece of shit.

01:02:13.833 --> 01:02:15.249
Oh, fuck!

01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:19.374
Jesus, God Almighty.
Fucking thing. Look at this.

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:24.374
Is this a meeting
about something new?

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.290
Hmm? Well, potentially.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.457
It's complicated.

01:02:29.583 --> 01:02:32.290
We're hoping for some money
from a sale of movie rights.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:35.707
Is that woman still your editor?

01:02:35.833 --> 01:02:38.249
No. She's an asshole
with no loyalty as well.

01:02:40.166 --> 01:02:42.915
- What about...
- Are you here only to put me on the spot?

01:02:43.041 --> 01:02:44.915
None of this is worth revisiting to me.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:48.582
I've been betrayed by
a lot of small-minded and worthless people.

01:02:48.708 --> 01:02:50.457
Do I need them to
accomplish anything?

01:02:50.583 --> 01:02:54.374
The answer is no.
They are altogether nothing.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.999
Having once known me will always be
the most interesting thing about them.

01:02:58.125 --> 01:03:00.540
Those fucking vultures
have fed off me longer

01:03:00.666 --> 01:03:02.290
than any sane man
would have allowed.

01:03:04.916 --> 01:03:08.249
That sounds like a horrible example
to set for your little student.

01:03:08.375 --> 01:03:10.624
So what? He's not my kid.

01:03:17.416 --> 01:03:19.665
(Narrator) 'Ike's time with Philip
had been rejuvenating,

01:03:19.791 --> 01:03:21.332
'restoring a sense of pride and vitality

01:03:21.458 --> 01:03:24.499
'that the man at one point
subsided solely upon.

01:03:25.958 --> 01:03:28.540
'The adoration and attention
was something he'd not felt in years

01:03:28.666 --> 01:03:31.749
'and, during the summer months,
resulted in Ike feeling stronger

01:03:31.875 --> 01:03:34.249
'and more productive
than he had been in some time.

01:03:36.041 --> 01:03:38.540
'When Philip departed
in late August for the college,

01:03:38.666 --> 01:03:40.707
'Ike was remiss
to find himself backsliding

01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:44.457
'into a familiar pattern
of boredom and tedium.

01:03:45.666 --> 01:03:47.540
'His friendship with Philip
eventually served

01:03:47.666 --> 01:03:50.749
'as little other than a reminder
of the absences in his life,

01:03:50.875 --> 01:03:53.040
'and of their increasing
presence and volume.

01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:57.790
'Seeing Philip during
the previous weekend

01:03:57.916 --> 01:04:00.665
'had left Ike in an even lower
state of self-pity,

01:04:00.791 --> 01:04:03.749
'as he found himself unable to produce
a worthwhile thought.

01:04:03.875 --> 01:04:07.124
'So consumed was he
with the solitude and self-imposed exile

01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:10.874
'he had once coveted and manufactured
for himself so meticulously

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.957
'but now experienced only
as an infinitely replenishing prism of regret.

01:04:19.125 --> 01:04:21.457
'The companionship of Melanie
was, at best, diverting

01:04:21.583 --> 01:04:24.374
'and, at worst, a constant reminder
of the multitudes of relationships

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.165
'Ike had gleefully sabotaged
over the years,

01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:32.082
'all in the name of preserving
and feeding his increasingly insatiable ego.

01:04:32.208 --> 01:04:34.582
'When she asked, he would refuse
to be open or honest

01:04:34.708 --> 01:04:36.832
'about the past several years of his life,

01:04:36.958 --> 01:04:39.290
'neglecting to satisfy her curiosity
about what had become

01:04:39.416 --> 01:04:42.207
'of his many friends,
acquaintances and colleagues.'

01:04:54.166 --> 01:04:56.374
Nobody's seen her
since she was a teenager.

01:04:58.041 --> 01:05:00.207
Well, she stopped visiting
right about then.

01:05:01.166 --> 01:05:03.624
Which is just as well.
She's a pain in the ass.

01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:05.124
How so?

01:05:05.958 --> 01:05:07.082
She asks too many questions.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.874
She used to have
all those cute friends.

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:14.874
- Have any of them been by?
- I'm...

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.749
I'm not here all the time.

01:05:22.416 --> 01:05:23.874
I used to be a lion.

01:05:24.791 --> 01:05:26.249
We all did.

01:05:27.416 --> 01:05:29.415
I think we've become pathetic.

01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.915
Want to hear a funny idea?

instructor giving dance instructions)

01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:58.624
(Groans) Come on up, come on.

01:05:58.750 --> 01:05:59.999
Hey, come on.

01:06:00.125 --> 01:06:02.874
Here, take your coat off.
Here you are.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.040
Yeah.

01:06:04.166 --> 01:06:06.332
This is my place.
My humble home.

01:06:07.416 --> 01:06:08.707
I know.

01:06:08.833 --> 01:06:10.582
- You want to take your coat off?
- Oh, thank you.

01:06:10.708 --> 01:06:12.790
Yeah, I'll set it right here.

01:06:12.916 --> 01:06:15.832
- So, er... drinks?
- Sure, of course.

01:06:15.958 --> 01:06:17.999
We have some wine,
red wine, white wine.

01:06:18.125 --> 01:06:19.457
- Erm... red.
- Red?

01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:21.040
- Norm?
- Prosecco.

01:06:21.166 --> 01:06:22.707
- Ah...
- Prosecco!

01:06:22.833 --> 01:06:24.582
That's fancy, Norm.

01:06:28.666 --> 01:06:30.124
(Norm) You know, I love movies.

01:06:34.708 --> 01:06:36.582
So here's a line from a movie.
You have to guess.

01:06:38.916 --> 01:06:43.957
She says to a younger man
who's trying to woo her, to flirt with her...

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:47.832
And she says to him, "You don't want me.
You want somebody young and fresh."

01:06:48.416 --> 01:06:51.999
And she goes,
"Armies have marched over me."

01:06:52.958 --> 01:06:54.749
- All right, guess that one.
- Right away.

01:06:54.875 --> 01:06:56.207
Thank you.

01:06:57.333 --> 01:06:58.999
(Woman) Are we supposed to guess
who said that?

01:06:59.125 --> 01:07:00.582
- Well, maybe. Yeah.
- What movie?

01:07:00.708 --> 01:07:02.957
- What was your name again?
- Thank you. Flo.

01:07:05.291 --> 01:07:07.790
Flow gently, sweet Afton.

01:07:07.916 --> 01:07:10.665
It is spoken by Rita Hayworth.

01:07:10.791 --> 01:07:12.457
- Do you remember Rita Hayworth?
- Of course.

01:07:12.583 --> 01:07:14.499
- Yes!
- They don't remember Rita Hayworth.

01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:16.249
(Laughs)

01:07:16.375 --> 01:07:19.374
In a movie called
Fire Down Below.

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:20.707
Hey, you know that?

01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:23.207
There's snow on the roof,
but there's fire down below.

01:07:23.333 --> 01:07:25.457
- Santé! Santé!
- You're French, right?

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:27.457
Come here. It's more cosy.

01:07:27.583 --> 01:07:30.415
- Yeah, come on.
- Is there anyone else coming tonight?

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.790
Well, I'm younger than Norm.

01:07:34.916 --> 01:07:38.082
Oh, I thought you said
there was a party happening.

01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:40.374
Oh, I'm sorry, I... Maybe I...

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.040
I have a secret weapon.

01:07:42.166 --> 01:07:43.624
- Oh!
- I'll go get it.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.832
Just hold it right there.

01:07:45.958 --> 01:07:47.957
Yeah, he's young.

01:07:48.083 --> 01:07:50.499
He's not tall, but he's young.

01:07:55.291 --> 01:07:57.332
Philip. Philip, get over here.

01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:00.249
No, now, as quick as you can.

01:08:01.208 --> 01:08:02.999
Get here now.

01:08:04.291 --> 01:08:08.374
So there was these two old men
sitting in deck chairs on the beach,

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.332
and one of them turns to the other
and he says, "It's nice out today,"

01:08:11.458 --> 01:08:13.999
and the other one says,
"Sure, I'll get mine out in a minute."

01:08:14.125 --> 01:08:15.457
(Laughter)

01:08:15.583 --> 01:08:17.499
(Knock on door)

01:08:17.625 --> 01:08:20.790
Hey, let's hope it's a boy! Huh?

01:08:21.791 --> 01:08:23.249
Philip!

01:08:23.875 --> 01:08:26.915
Come on, stand up.
Oh, you are standing. (Laughs)

01:08:27.041 --> 01:08:29.165
Come in, come in. Hey.

01:08:29.291 --> 01:08:30.457
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:08:30.582 --> 01:08:32.332
Oh! In you come.

01:08:32.457 --> 01:08:34.874
(Whispers) We will be social
with these women tonight.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.665
Son, you're young. Come on.

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.374
Huh? What are you?

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.082
- Old.
- Yeah?

01:08:42.207 --> 01:08:43.665
Wise.

01:08:43.791 --> 01:08:45.665
And also rich, which helps.

01:08:45.791 --> 01:08:49.332
Yeah, one day you'll be old, wise and rich.
Now get in there.

01:08:49.457 --> 01:08:52.457
Come on. Enjoy yourself! (Laughs)

01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:58.165
Call me son, yeah?
Hi, I'm Philip.

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:00.290
My name is Philip.

01:09:00.916 --> 01:09:02.665
- Hello.
- (Woman) Hi.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:06.665
I know who you are,
but it's a real pleasure.

01:09:06.791 --> 01:09:09.374
- An old friend of Ike's.
- How do you know each other?

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.332
Well, I've never met him personally,
but, um...

01:09:11.457 --> 01:09:14.999
- You've heard of me.
- I've read. I've read who I think you are.

01:09:15.125 --> 01:09:18.665
- (Woman) Wow.
- Yeah, he's... you know who he is, correct?

01:09:19.582 --> 01:09:22.332
No, should we know who he is?

01:09:22.457 --> 01:09:24.374
- Yeah, he's one of the...
- I don't know whether you should...

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.874
- I... I write.
- He's what they call essential.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.374
- A writer.
- Like the profession.

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:31.374
This guy is like,
they teach this guy.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.499
- You know...
- Oh, really?

01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:35.624
Yeah, I'm gonna just go check
really quickly on the lord of the manor.

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:38.499
Oh! Well, get yourself a drink.
You need a drink.

01:09:38.625 --> 01:09:39.874
Well, I shouldn't, probably.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.165
I've already taken, like,
all kinds of strange things

01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:44.124
before coming over here,
so I don't know.

01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:46.332
- Good, you'll be able...
- You look very put together.

01:09:46.457 --> 01:09:48.999
You handle your things well.

01:09:49.125 --> 01:09:51.249
I do handle them well, but...

01:09:51.375 --> 01:09:54.957
I'm speaking of allergy medicine in this case,
'cause upstate really fucks with me.

01:09:55.083 --> 01:09:56.124
All right, have yourself...

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:58.582
All right, have yourself
a merry little Christmas. I'll be right back.

01:09:59.333 --> 01:10:01.249
- Good to see you.
- It's an honour.

01:10:01.833 --> 01:10:02.832
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

01:10:02.958 --> 01:10:03.957
Sit down.

01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:07.540
What are you doing in here?

01:10:07.666 --> 01:10:09.999
- They said they want you to come back.
- You fucked up.

01:10:10.125 --> 01:10:11.332
- Huh?
- Get back in there.

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.915
I could have made that transaction
in two minutes when I was your age.

01:10:15.041 --> 01:10:16.874
Twice a week.
Fucking get back in there.

01:10:17.416 --> 01:10:19.915
Well, it's my understanding
that was a different time.

01:10:20.041 --> 01:10:21.915
Women were, you know...
looser then.

01:10:22.416 --> 01:10:23.957
Also much more
impressed by authors.

01:10:24.083 --> 01:10:26.040
Yeah, authors like me.

01:10:26.166 --> 01:10:27.290
Get in!

01:10:27.416 --> 01:10:28.707
(Woman) You wrote that book?

01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:31.499
- Well, no. No, no, no. Listen.
- Oh, my god.

01:10:31.625 --> 01:10:35.207
- Can we have an autograph?
- You wanted to know about Joseph Conrad.

01:10:35.333 --> 01:10:37.165
(Ike) And we're back.

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:40.624
Hey, hey, how about you give us
a little tune on the piano, huh?

01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:42.332
- Uh...
- Come on, come on.

01:10:42.458 --> 01:10:44.749
You want a little song?
A song from Philip?

01:10:44.875 --> 01:10:46.040
(Norm) Georgia on My Mind.

01:10:46.166 --> 01:10:48.040
More upbeat. Upbeat.

01:10:48.166 --> 01:10:49.665
Let's dance. Let's dance.

01:10:49.791 --> 01:10:51.124
(♪ Upbeat music playing on piano)

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:52.915
(Ike) Oh, that's it.

01:11:14.708 --> 01:11:17.207
(Ike) Melanie! Hey, hey, hey!

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.540
Look who's here! Hey!

01:11:19.666 --> 01:11:20.665
(Philip) Hey.
(Woman) Hi.

01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:22.374
(Ike) That's my daughter, huh?

01:11:23.291 --> 01:11:24.999
(Melanie) I hate you both.

01:11:25.125 --> 01:11:27.499
- (Whispers) I have nothing to do with this.
- Oh, didn't you?

01:11:27.958 --> 01:11:29.499
Go fuck yourself.

01:11:31.375 --> 01:11:33.165
(♪ Music resumes)

01:11:38.375 --> 01:11:40.124
You've ruined this night for me.

01:11:41.458 --> 01:11:43.499
OK, OK, OK. No, no.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.499
It's over, it's over.

01:11:46.291 --> 01:11:47.915
OK, you should go.

01:11:49.625 --> 01:11:50.915
Go, go, go!

01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:01.749
Thanks for coming.

01:12:01.875 --> 01:12:03.374
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:09.790
Ike. What just happened?

01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:12.374
I told you what she's like.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.499
- I didn't think it was that...
- Yeah.

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:20.624
I'd completely forgotten
she was here.

01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:24.082
Oh, she can be
such a bitch sometimes.

01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:27.249
To hell with her.

01:12:27.916 --> 01:12:29.457
- Norm?
- Yes, sir.

01:12:29.583 --> 01:12:30.999
Little drink for the road.

01:12:31.125 --> 01:12:32.874
- Thank you.
- Huh?

01:12:34.333 --> 01:12:36.165
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

01:12:36.958 --> 01:12:39.332
Smell that? '25.

01:12:39.458 --> 01:12:41.415
(Philip) All right, the good stuff.

01:12:42.041 --> 01:12:43.874
Philip, I've, er...

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.374
I got something special for you.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:49.082
I don't talk to her mother anymore.
Did I tell you that?

01:12:49.208 --> 01:12:51.332
I guess I just sort of assumed it.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.874
She asked me about it the other day.
I didn't know what to say to her.

01:12:56.041 --> 01:12:57.624
Oh, God.

01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:01.082
She can be such a pain in the ass.

01:13:01.208 --> 01:13:03.124
Anyway, here's to us.

01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:04.915
Cheers. Philip.

01:13:06.416 --> 01:13:10.082
Seems like it's just you and me left now,
Norm, huh?

01:13:10.875 --> 01:13:12.290
Oh, hey.

01:13:12.416 --> 01:13:14.082
I forgot to tell you.

01:13:14.875 --> 01:13:16.874
I saw this the other day.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.040
Hmm?

01:13:18.166 --> 01:13:23.249
The guy you were supposed
to do the journalism piece on, that snake?

01:13:23.875 --> 01:13:26.415
It seems he took his own life.

01:13:28.458 --> 01:13:29.957
- Jesus.
- Who is it? Who's that?

01:13:30.083 --> 01:13:31.457
(Ike) What's he called?

01:13:31.583 --> 01:13:33.707
(Philip) Josh Fawn, the writer.

01:13:34.916 --> 01:13:37.915
I mean, I'm glad he's dead and all, but...

01:13:38.041 --> 01:13:41.665
Doing that interview would have been
a really great opportunity for me.

01:13:41.791 --> 01:13:45.499
Last interviews are hard to get,
because you never know.

01:13:45.625 --> 01:13:47.915
I know this guy.
I like his work.

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:50.957
- I had lunch with him recently.
- You did?

01:13:51.083 --> 01:13:52.832
- I did.
- (Ike) You had lunch with him?

01:13:52.958 --> 01:13:55.582
- Yes.
- Lunch, and, whoo! (Laughs)

01:13:58.916 --> 01:14:00.207
Oh, well.

01:14:00.333 --> 01:14:02.915
Erm... you know, I'm looking forward
to reading your work.

01:14:03.041 --> 01:14:05.374
Hey, hey, hey, don't buy a copy.
I got plenty here.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:06.957
You can have one of mine.

01:14:07.833 --> 01:14:09.582
Anyway, listen...

01:14:10.875 --> 01:14:12.915
I gotta go to bed, OK?

01:14:13.041 --> 01:14:15.290
Old Ikey has got to get some rest.

01:14:15.416 --> 01:14:16.874
Why don't you stay here tonight?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.082
I've got a meeting at the college tomorrow.
You can drive me there.

01:14:20.958 --> 01:14:22.790
- Erm...
- Is that good?

01:14:22.916 --> 01:14:24.374
- Yeah.
- OK.

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:26.499
- I didn't bring a toothbrush.
- Good night, everybody.

01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:28.332
Good night.

01:14:28.458 --> 01:14:30.207
- Night.
- Good night to you.

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:31.999
- Norm.
- Take care.

01:14:32.125 --> 01:14:33.707
Was a pleasure.

01:14:33.833 --> 01:14:34.957
Take care.

01:14:35.083 --> 01:14:36.082
- And...
- Be well.

01:14:36.208 --> 01:14:38.207
- I can, I will be.
- Oh, well, don't look at that.

01:14:38.333 --> 01:14:39.915
Jesus Christ.

01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:42.790
You dick.

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:51.499
- Good one?
- Good enough.

01:14:54.666 --> 01:14:59.207
Even looking at the girls here
brings on a cascade of conflicting emotions.

01:14:59.333 --> 01:15:02.082
They're always gonna want more
than you're prepared to offer.

01:15:02.208 --> 01:15:04.957
You remember that.
You'll learn it yourself one day,

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:06.624
if you haven't already.

01:15:07.958 --> 01:15:11.415
What are you thinking about?
Are you thinking about what I just told you?

01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:15.207
This place looks unforgiving.

01:15:15.333 --> 01:15:17.499
Suffers in comparison
to the guest room.

01:15:18.416 --> 01:15:20.124
Well, the offer's still on the table.

01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:21.957
Don't sit on the car.

01:15:24.291 --> 01:15:26.374
Listen, this isn't the city.

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.832
They're a different breed of snob up here.

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:31.124
It's academia.

01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:32.790
Academia nuts.

01:15:32.916 --> 01:15:34.374
(Laughs)

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.082
I fail to understand the distinction.

01:15:36.583 --> 01:15:38.707
Yeah, I do, too, sometimes.

01:15:38.833 --> 01:15:40.499
It's been really awful.

01:15:41.791 --> 01:15:43.499
I consider you my good friend.

01:15:44.250 --> 01:15:45.707
I appreciate that.

01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:49.082
But you'll soon find
how little that counts for.

01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:54.374
I'm not referring to myself,
but there's a lot of assholes out there.

01:15:55.708 --> 01:15:58.832
Less up here than in the city,
but it's all relative.

01:16:16.625 --> 01:16:20.207
You say it yourself. You don't see anybody.
You have no friendships.

01:16:20.333 --> 01:16:23.790
And you have ruined every relationship
in which you ever could have found meaning.

01:16:23.916 --> 01:16:25.332
Who?

01:16:26.291 --> 01:16:29.290
Huh? Associates?
Sycophants?

01:16:29.416 --> 01:16:32.290
Who the fuck needs pissants like that?
Good riddance.

01:16:32.416 --> 01:16:34.040
Me. Mom.

01:16:34.166 --> 01:16:36.540
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, as usual.

01:16:36.666 --> 01:16:39.457
Why do you assume
that she never talked to me?

01:16:39.583 --> 01:16:41.874
Oh, I'm sure she was only too eager

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.207
to fill your head with some inane,
fictitious bullshit.

01:16:45.333 --> 01:16:47.124
But one thing I know for a fact,

01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:49.249
you only got one version of events

01:16:49.375 --> 01:16:53.707
told from the perspective of a very sad,
very lonely, pathetic woman.

01:16:53.833 --> 01:16:55.832
You insult again.

01:16:56.375 --> 01:16:58.332
This is my mother
you're talking about.

01:16:58.458 --> 01:16:59.915
And? Go on.

01:17:00.041 --> 01:17:03.332
You talk about her like she's
some leech that sucked you dry.

01:17:03.458 --> 01:17:07.082
Yeah, well, she would have done,
given half the chance.

01:17:07.208 --> 01:17:08.749
Her and everyone else.

01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:12.082
You know,
she is my biggest regret, hmm?

01:17:12.208 --> 01:17:15.499
The strongest and saddest proof
that you cannot change anyone,

01:17:15.625 --> 01:17:18.790
and that your first instinct about them
will always be right.

01:17:18.916 --> 01:17:22.582
Yeah, well, that just proves
that you yourself can't be changed, either.

01:17:22.708 --> 01:17:25.749
Yeah, well, much to my chagrin,
I prove my own point.

01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:29.457
I always try to lead by example...

01:17:30.208 --> 01:17:33.124
To show everyone
how I can put aside preconceptions

01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:36.040
and find new feelings, new ideas.

01:17:36.166 --> 01:17:38.624
But the innate ineffability
of human disappointment

01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:41.374
overcomes my faith every time.

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.457
- So, when you belittle me...
- "Belittle you"?

01:17:43.583 --> 01:17:45.540
- I didn't even fucking say anything to you.
- Yes!

01:17:45.666 --> 01:17:47.915
- What are you talking about?
- "Belittle me"!

01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:51.665
For my self-made disconnect
from those who want nothing from me

01:17:51.791 --> 01:17:55.665
but to further their own
petty feelings of self-delusion.

01:17:55.791 --> 01:17:59.874
Then you reinforce the degree to which
I saved myself from future disappointment

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.999
by cutting myself off
to the extent that I did!

01:18:07.875 --> 01:18:09.624
Do you hear yourself?

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.874
(Narrator) 'The emotions which arose

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.249
'from the spectacular confrontation
with his daughter

01:18:14.375 --> 01:18:18.624
'enraged and excited Ike in such a way
as he no longer felt possible.

01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:21.332
'Philip's unbridled respect
and reverence for his idol,

01:18:21.458 --> 01:18:24.457
'compounded with his
youthful sense of rage and entitlement,

01:18:24.583 --> 01:18:27.415
'had forced unwanted introspection
upon Ike.

01:18:28.583 --> 01:18:31.374
'And what he saw was
a shamefully complacent old man,

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.540
'who had long since given up
the forcefulness

01:18:33.666 --> 01:18:37.207
'that had once motivated him
to create some of his best work.

01:18:38.083 --> 01:18:39.999
(Car engine starts)

01:19:04.166 --> 01:19:07.374
'The autumn months had brought about
an overwhelming sense of shame in Ike,

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.374
'as he tried and failed
to put out of his mind

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:12.790
'the vigour and dissatisfaction
that once drove him to succeed,

01:19:12.916 --> 01:19:17.040
'replaced with frustration,
self-pity and disappointment.'

01:19:35.958 --> 01:19:37.790
(Ike) And of course,
the frustrating thing is

01:19:37.916 --> 01:19:40.624
to want to focus your energies
on something

01:19:40.750 --> 01:19:44.665
that, well, at this point in my life,
should be something of an opus.

01:19:44.791 --> 01:19:46.749
- A culmination.
- Right.

01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:51.374
Could we swap seats?
I don't feel right sitting here.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:54.124
I'd rather not sit in a pupil's chair
in my own office.

01:19:55.333 --> 01:19:58.624
We can both sit over there,
or we can both stand.

01:20:02.416 --> 01:20:03.749
(Sighs)

01:20:04.583 --> 01:20:06.332
I've had years of this shit.

01:20:07.416 --> 01:20:09.249
How long did yours take?

01:20:09.375 --> 01:20:10.749
Something like two years apiece.

01:20:10.875 --> 01:20:12.915
Oh, God, I used to be
faster than that.

01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:16.665
Two years would be
humiliating for me.

01:20:16.791 --> 01:20:18.874
(Chuckles) Well, for anyone.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.957
I... I didn't mean it like that,
but you get the idea.

01:20:24.125 --> 01:20:26.207
(Exhales)
This could be so big for me.

01:20:26.333 --> 01:20:29.040
Instead, I... I'm suffering here.

01:20:30.166 --> 01:20:33.624
More than you could know
or I could possibly explain.

01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:36.415
I just don't see anything clearly.

01:20:38.916 --> 01:20:40.665
I'm trying to do my best here.

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:43.040
Oh, fuck it.

01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:47.374
I should have this
figured out by now.

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:48.665
Well, thank you for listening

01:20:48.791 --> 01:20:51.874
to the sentimental and frustrated ramblings
of an old man.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.374
- You've done a lot for me.
- I didn't do much.

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.249
No. But your work did.

01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:58.082
That's true.

01:20:58.208 --> 01:21:00.124
Bonjour, Yvette. Ça va?

01:21:04.583 --> 01:21:06.957
- She's Yvette?
- Yeah.

01:21:08.041 --> 01:21:10.832
(Narrator) 'Yvette Dussart
was entering her third year on the faculty

01:21:10.958 --> 01:21:14.290
'when she was informed that a young,
newly successful author from the city

01:21:14.416 --> 01:21:16.165
'would be joining the English department,

01:21:16.291 --> 01:21:18.749
'which she took as a personal attack
on her territory,

01:21:18.875 --> 01:21:21.874
'as it relieved her of the title
of youngest faculty member,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.707
'a distinction from which she derived
no small amount of satisfaction.

01:21:25.625 --> 01:21:28.749
'Philip and Yvette were only about
three years apart in age.'

01:21:28.875 --> 01:21:30.707
(Speaks French)

01:21:34.791 --> 01:21:36.749
'Prior to his arrival and introduction,

01:21:36.875 --> 01:21:39.374
'Yvette had decided to act
unkind towards him,

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:41.874
'and was able to convince
several other faculty members

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.999
'that, in fact, a novelist
with no teaching experience

01:21:45.125 --> 01:21:46.790
'did not belong among their ranks,

01:21:46.916 --> 01:21:50.207
'a cunning move that created
an environment of tension and hostility

01:21:50.333 --> 01:21:53.124
'before Philip appeared
for what became an increasingly painful,

01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:56.040
'and humiliating orientation process.

01:21:56.166 --> 01:22:00.374
'The result of her scheming was immediate
and total isolation for Philip,

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.832
'who routinely found himself
with nothing more to do

01:22:02.958 --> 01:22:05.374
'than retreat to his small,
sad apartment every night,

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:08.749
'where he made a concerted effort
to devote himself fully to his writing,

01:22:08.875 --> 01:22:11.165
'and to doing as good a job teaching
as possible.'

01:22:11.791 --> 01:22:14.540
I wonder what type of style
we should be working on for these exercises.

01:22:14.666 --> 01:22:16.832
I'm not sure I can answer that question.

01:22:16.958 --> 01:22:18.124
In fact, I'm certain I cannot.

01:22:18.250 --> 01:22:21.999
I don't have a very academic relationship
with form or style.

01:22:22.125 --> 01:22:24.790
So... what is your advice?

01:22:24.916 --> 01:22:27.457
The best thing I can offer is what I do,

01:22:27.583 --> 01:22:31.124
which is to kinda goof around
until you find what works.

01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:32.290
Besides, in my experience,

01:22:32.416 --> 01:22:34.332
more than half of you
will probably abandon writing,

01:22:34.458 --> 01:22:36.624
creative or the other kind,
very shortly after graduating.

01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:37.749
If you haven't already.

01:22:38.666 --> 01:22:41.540
I'm thinking of a few of you specifically
when I say that last part.

01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:42.874
Hey, hey.

01:22:43.416 --> 01:22:45.582
Are you at all qualified to be teachin'?

01:22:47.666 --> 01:22:50.165
I never use the word "teach".
I always say "instruct".

01:22:52.916 --> 01:22:53.957
Nice try.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.999
You've made it a point
to turn others against me,

01:23:12.125 --> 01:23:13.457
and I don't understand why.

01:23:14.208 --> 01:23:15.499
I've not.

01:23:16.708 --> 01:23:17.707
You have.

01:23:17.833 --> 01:23:20.040
And as a result,
I'm sad and alone...

01:23:22.583 --> 01:23:24.082
I don't like it here.

01:23:38.666 --> 01:23:40.874
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:23:43.791 --> 01:23:46.499
I read Obidant.
I really liked it.

01:23:47.333 --> 01:23:49.874
- I didn't realise it had come out already.
- About two weeks ago.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.332
Huh.

01:23:52.458 --> 01:23:54.040
Listen, it's nothing personal, but...

01:23:54.166 --> 01:23:55.999
I'm really trying to do
my best up here,

01:23:56.125 --> 01:23:59.249
and part of that means
not getting involved with anybody

01:23:59.375 --> 01:24:02.165
in, er... say, a human way.

01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:05.582
So if you'd like, you could
come visit me at my office.

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:07.207
This is not my office.

01:24:11.791 --> 01:24:13.540
(Indistinct chatter)

01:24:13.666 --> 01:24:16.249
Please don't act like somebody
who doesn't know how to handle themselves.

01:24:17.375 --> 01:24:18.915
I don't know what you mean.

01:24:19.041 --> 01:24:21.707
Act as though you attend these things
all the time.

01:24:21.833 --> 01:24:22.957
How?

01:24:23.083 --> 01:24:25.207
Feel like you don't want to be here.
Like me.

01:24:25.333 --> 01:24:26.999
See how little I wanna be here?

01:24:27.875 --> 01:24:29.707
But I very much want to be here.

01:24:31.166 --> 01:24:32.624
Oh, Jonathan.

01:24:35.041 --> 01:24:36.540
Are you proud of me?

01:24:36.666 --> 01:24:38.082
In what way?

01:24:39.458 --> 01:24:40.749
Never mind.

01:24:41.791 --> 01:24:44.124
(Jonathan) You seem to have
a decent situation here.

01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:46.957
- This place is just fine.
- Yeah.

01:25:07.625 --> 01:25:10.499
(Yvette) You do not need to look away
every time you see me.

01:25:14.791 --> 01:25:16.874
Was it your father
I saw you with earlier?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.040
He's my uncle. Mon oncle.
Like the film.

01:25:21.083 --> 01:25:22.290
You look sad with him.

01:25:24.416 --> 01:25:26.582
I don't think you're saying
what you think you are.

01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:28.832
I meant to say...

01:25:28.958 --> 01:25:32.249
When with him, it makes you look
as though you are not happy.

01:25:32.375 --> 01:25:35.290
Oh. I guess that's pretty much
what you said the first time.

01:25:35.416 --> 01:25:36.999
Why is this?

01:25:37.125 --> 01:25:38.915
Your own family
makes you unhappy?

01:25:39.041 --> 01:25:41.665
I don't feel comfortable
talking to you like this.

01:25:42.291 --> 01:25:44.207
- Why?
- Because we don't like each other.

01:25:44.333 --> 01:25:45.915
Or you don't like me.

01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:48.874
It's not like that. I mean...

01:25:50.291 --> 01:25:52.249
OK, it's true that I am upset that

01:25:52.375 --> 01:25:55.540
I study for years to obtain
a teaching degree, and you...

01:25:55.666 --> 01:25:59.999
You just publish two slim novels
and get a job many would murder for.

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:06.749
I, however, think it is possible
we could be friendly together.

01:26:07.583 --> 01:26:09.457
You encouraged the faculty
to turn on me.

01:26:09.583 --> 01:26:11.249
Nobody likes me here.

01:26:12.833 --> 01:26:14.249
Nobody ever talks to me.

01:26:14.375 --> 01:26:17.957
We like it here.
We have family and community.

01:26:18.083 --> 01:26:20.499
And you've just come here
with your new novel

01:26:20.625 --> 01:26:23.999
and turned them against yourself
with your arrogance and ego.

01:26:25.166 --> 01:26:27.457
You're to blame nobody
but yourself for these things.

01:26:27.583 --> 01:26:28.874
I don't know how to process that.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.249
I'm not sure how quickly
I can absolve you of wrongdoing

01:26:31.375 --> 01:26:33.040
and shoulder the blame myself.

01:26:36.041 --> 01:26:38.040
I'd like to go elsewhere and talk.

01:26:38.791 --> 01:26:39.790
Speak with you more.

01:26:40.708 --> 01:26:42.249
Just not standing here, outside.

01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:43.957
OK.

01:26:44.083 --> 01:26:45.790
Just not back in there.

01:27:00.375 --> 01:27:02.040
Hello.

01:27:06.125 --> 01:27:08.665
I thought it best if my students
don't ever see me out of class.

01:27:09.458 --> 01:27:10.874
So, what do you do at night?

01:27:11.625 --> 01:27:13.749
I stay home, I read, and I think.

01:27:13.875 --> 01:27:16.499
It'll make my life harder
if people see me differently.

01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:18.332
Does that make sense?

01:27:18.458 --> 01:27:20.957
And you only want to be thought of
as a talented writer

01:27:21.083 --> 01:27:22.665
and not as a real person?

01:27:25.125 --> 01:27:26.749
Hmm, yeah.

01:27:27.291 --> 01:27:29.415
Yeah.
That's probably about right.

01:27:30.166 --> 01:27:32.207
In fact, that's exactly right.

01:27:32.333 --> 01:27:33.665
(Speaks French)

01:27:34.541 --> 01:27:35.957
Thank you.

01:27:37.666 --> 01:27:38.915
All right.

01:27:43.166 --> 01:27:45.124
Be a good boy.
Give me a call, OK?

01:27:45.250 --> 01:27:46.749
Yeah.

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:53.040
I never had a weekend on campus
where I went to school.

01:27:53.166 --> 01:27:54.374
I can't really quite adjust.

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.749
Last night your uncle
and then me...

01:27:56.875 --> 01:27:59.207
It's your first real conversation
since you arrived here?

01:27:59.333 --> 01:28:02.915
Conversation that took place on or around
campus and was substantial? Yes.

01:28:03.708 --> 01:28:05.790
Wow.
You must be really lonely.

01:28:05.916 --> 01:28:07.624
Can't see your eyes in that hat.

01:28:08.708 --> 01:28:10.415
That's better.
Where are you going?

01:28:35.958 --> 01:28:38.124
- Are your office hours over?
- For the time being.

01:28:38.250 --> 01:28:40.499
Also they're for people in classes I teach.
That's not you, is it?

01:28:40.625 --> 01:28:42.957
- No, but I was hoping...
- No, it's urgent.

01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:48.374
So, today we'll be learning
about the Romantic period,

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:51.665
and the impact of
the French Revolution,

01:28:51.791 --> 01:28:53.874
such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and...

01:28:55.625 --> 01:28:58.124
Erm... William Godwin and...

01:28:59.541 --> 01:29:01.790
Erm... did anyone read it?

01:29:03.875 --> 01:29:05.957
Er... we'll be also talking about the...

01:29:06.916 --> 01:29:09.124
(Chuckles) ...romantic themes.

01:29:10.416 --> 01:29:13.624
Sorry, the cult of sensibility, emphasising...

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:22.915
(Chuckles)
Sorry, what were we talking about?

01:29:26.166 --> 01:29:29.665
Well, this is the most amount of visitors
I've ever seen during a single session.

01:29:29.791 --> 01:29:31.040
And on a Friday, no less.

01:29:31.166 --> 01:29:32.499
What a world.

01:29:32.625 --> 01:29:34.457
One second.

01:29:35.375 --> 01:29:36.915
(Thudding)

01:29:44.166 --> 01:29:45.165
Come right in.

01:29:45.708 --> 01:29:47.582
When I was in school,
I never went to these things,

01:29:47.708 --> 01:29:49.582
- so I tend to forget about them.
- That's OK.

01:29:49.708 --> 01:29:51.499
I was hoping we could discuss my story.

01:29:51.625 --> 01:29:53.624
Right. Which I read.

01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:56.124
I think the perspective
was very clear.

01:29:56.250 --> 01:29:59.665
Erm... and, also,
I should say that...

01:30:00.708 --> 01:30:02.040
What was the title of it again?

01:30:02.833 --> 01:30:05.207
I'll be honest.
That's not the main reason I'm here.

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:08.540
Thank God, because honestly,
I don't even think I've read yours yet.

01:30:08.666 --> 01:30:11.082
Or any of them, for that matter,
so don't be offended.

01:30:11.208 --> 01:30:13.790
I was hoping you could provide me with
a letter of recommendation

01:30:13.916 --> 01:30:16.790
for an internship I'm pursuing
at Paragon Press.

01:30:20.291 --> 01:30:22.082
- OK.
- Is that not possible?

01:30:22.916 --> 01:30:25.374
Look, I'll say this,
and then we can proceed accordingly.

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:28.540
Number one, internships are a waste of time,
so you shouldn't bother.

01:30:29.208 --> 01:30:30.707
Two, that company sucks,

01:30:30.833 --> 01:30:33.207
and you wouldn't gain
any worthwhile experience there.

01:30:33.333 --> 01:30:36.749
And three, I don't actually think
that I know you very well.

01:30:36.875 --> 01:30:38.332
Or at all, now that I think about it.

01:30:38.458 --> 01:30:41.290
So, I wouldn't be the best person
to sing your praises.

01:30:41.416 --> 01:30:44.707
Where does that leave us
on the whole letter of recommendation tip?

01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:47.165
I think they can be somewhat generic.

01:30:47.291 --> 01:30:49.624
It's kind of a formality anyway.

01:30:50.958 --> 01:30:52.290
Nah.

01:30:54.875 --> 01:30:57.790
Does your publisher have
an internship programme?

01:30:57.916 --> 01:31:00.124
To be honest with you,
I have no idea.

01:31:00.250 --> 01:31:02.415
I'm not thinking
about this right now.

01:31:03.875 --> 01:31:06.165
Here's a piece of paper
with some staples in it.

01:31:10.416 --> 01:31:11.915
Wish I could be of more help.

01:31:15.125 --> 01:31:16.790
(Narrator)
'The semester drew to a close,

01:31:16.916 --> 01:31:20.499
'and an impending sense of melancholy
and longing developed within Philip,

01:31:20.625 --> 01:31:22.707
'as the promise of facing Ashley again

01:31:22.833 --> 01:31:26.415
'became less of an abstraction
and more of a looming certainty.

01:31:26.541 --> 01:31:29.999
'Anticipating this,
and unable to process his feelings verbally,

01:31:30.125 --> 01:31:32.624
'Philip wrote and mailed her a letter,
which read...'

01:31:33.458 --> 01:31:35.707
(Philip) "I find myself alone
again and again,

01:31:35.833 --> 01:31:39.332
"and I've abandoned hope that this is
something that can or will change.

01:31:39.458 --> 01:31:41.624
"I would extend my apologies
for neglecting to phone,

01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:43.957
"were I not certain
that they would be rejected.

01:31:44.083 --> 01:31:46.582
"I offer the honest yet
invented-sounding explanation

01:31:46.708 --> 01:31:49.040
"that hearing your voice
or anything about your current life

01:31:49.166 --> 01:31:51.957
"would compound my already
overwhelming sense of isolation and regret

01:31:52.083 --> 01:31:54.415
"in a way I would consider crippling.

01:31:54.541 --> 01:31:57.374
"My return date is set
for December the 15th.

01:31:57.500 --> 01:32:00.499
"I look forward to seeing
what type of person I feel like by then."

01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:03.415
(Narrator)
'The letter was signed simply, "P".

01:32:03.541 --> 01:32:06.374
'She threw it away
without ever opening the envelope.

01:32:09.125 --> 01:32:10.540
'Just under four weeks had passed

01:32:10.666 --> 01:32:13.249
'since Philip had last attempted
to contact Ashley,

01:32:13.375 --> 01:32:15.707
'and his letters
had started being returned.

01:32:15.833 --> 01:32:18.332
'The period following his collection
of midterm assignments

01:32:18.458 --> 01:32:19.790
'and leading up to Thanksgiving,

01:32:19.916 --> 01:32:23.749
'found Philip at long last adjusting
to his temporary life at the college.

01:32:23.875 --> 01:32:27.040
'No longer fighting against his situation
and finally at peace with it,

01:32:27.166 --> 01:32:30.540
'he had noticed himself making friends
where there before had been none,

01:32:30.666 --> 01:32:32.165
'and experiencing feelings and emotions

01:32:32.291 --> 01:32:35.624
'he had studiously blocked out
from August through late October.

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:39.290
'The result of which was his transformation
into a tolerable person

01:32:39.416 --> 01:32:41.290
'for whom the faculty began to care,

01:32:41.416 --> 01:32:44.415
'to say nothing of the added benefit
of winning Yvette's affections,

01:32:44.541 --> 01:32:48.665
'a goal of his since he first convinced himself
of the extent to which she disliked him.'

01:32:51.375 --> 01:32:52.790
I don't know
what you want me to tell you.

01:32:53.458 --> 01:32:55.249
You know
what I want you to tell me.

01:32:56.500 --> 01:32:58.999
Oh, the situation is
becoming really irritating.

01:32:59.125 --> 01:33:01.540
I have a life somewhere.
Or had one.

01:33:01.666 --> 01:33:03.874
I'm not sure which.
It's probably not even there anymore.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.582
Then forget it. And come back home with me
for the holiday break.

01:33:07.708 --> 01:33:09.999
I've nothing to do when I get back.
Also, I've nowhere to live.

01:33:10.125 --> 01:33:12.165
I don't work here permanently.
Only you do.

01:33:13.416 --> 01:33:15.207
I'm sure you can get
one more semester of work.

01:33:15.333 --> 01:33:17.124
Hang on while I put
my head in this sweater.

01:33:17.250 --> 01:33:18.790
Keep going.

01:33:18.916 --> 01:33:20.124
It is possible.

01:33:20.250 --> 01:33:21.957
A lot that would need to change
for that to happen.

01:33:25.291 --> 01:33:27.707
Are we still going to Ike's for Thanksgiving?
What are we bringing?

01:33:28.291 --> 01:33:30.207
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:33:36.791 --> 01:33:39.790
You know what? Why don't you stay
at your own apartment tonight?

01:33:39.916 --> 01:33:42.749
My apartment is sad
and has improper heating,

01:33:42.875 --> 01:33:46.165
which you know
because we're standing in it right now.

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:49.915
Oh!

01:33:58.333 --> 01:34:00.915
So, you don't want to be
trapped by academia.

01:34:01.041 --> 01:34:05.082
There are some people over there
who I wish I could still call my colleagues.

01:34:05.625 --> 01:34:07.915
They didn't want this life
for themselves.

01:34:08.041 --> 01:34:09.874
I told this to our boy here.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.082
You know, you have
to be very careful.

01:34:12.875 --> 01:34:16.540
Don't believe too strongly
the structures they put in front of you.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.207
This is good advice.

01:34:19.333 --> 01:34:21.290
For you more so than him, though.

01:34:22.416 --> 01:34:23.790
Excuse me.

01:34:27.291 --> 01:34:29.165
(Whistles quietly)

01:34:29.291 --> 01:34:31.332
You seem ill-equipped
to deal with someone like that.

01:34:31.458 --> 01:34:33.332
We began by hating one another.

01:34:33.458 --> 01:34:35.457
I think we're coming back
down the other side now.

01:34:36.291 --> 01:34:37.665
That's a very potent image.

01:34:37.791 --> 01:34:39.332
You should write it down and use it.

01:34:39.458 --> 01:34:41.665
I came up with it on the silent,
excruciating drive over here.

01:34:41.791 --> 01:34:44.374
- I'm glad you approve.
- Oh, I do, indeed.

01:34:45.791 --> 01:34:47.124
I should go check on her.

01:34:48.041 --> 01:34:49.665
Excuse me.

01:34:57.458 --> 01:34:59.082
I think you're being rude to Ike.

01:35:00.125 --> 01:35:02.082
I'm glad his feelings
are so important.

01:35:04.541 --> 01:35:06.374
I think I need to leave.

01:35:09.291 --> 01:35:10.749
You said you
wanted to meet him.

01:35:11.458 --> 01:35:12.624
Besides we just got here.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.540
Why don't you leave me alone?

01:35:23.708 --> 01:35:26.415
My uncle, who you saw in passing,

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:28.499
raised me

01:35:29.125 --> 01:35:31.915
because both of my parents
were killed in a car accident.

01:35:32.875 --> 01:35:34.499
Why are you telling me this?

01:35:42.083 --> 01:35:44.790
Because I want you to
contextualise my sadness.

01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:48.665
Put whatever you're going through
into perspective.

01:35:50.416 --> 01:35:52.040
My mom was pregnant
at the time.

01:35:52.666 --> 01:35:53.707
Seven months.

01:35:54.458 --> 01:35:56.040
I was on the news.

01:35:57.375 --> 01:35:59.374
I'm telling you this
to hurt you right now,

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:01.249
because you're trying
to make me feel bad,

01:36:02.083 --> 01:36:03.749
horrible even,

01:36:03.875 --> 01:36:05.499
which I don't appreciate.

01:36:07.208 --> 01:36:08.874
But I never will...

01:36:09.541 --> 01:36:10.999
Because nothing ever feels bad

01:36:11.125 --> 01:36:13.249
once you learn
what that emotion is capable of.

01:36:15.416 --> 01:36:17.665
Now let's not make
a big deal about it.

01:36:17.791 --> 01:36:19.332
I usually don't.

01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:23.249
But you really forced
my hand on this.

01:36:24.208 --> 01:36:25.957
Do you know that expression?

01:36:26.791 --> 01:36:28.290
"Forced my hand"?

01:36:29.666 --> 01:36:31.249
It's one of my favourites.

01:36:54.833 --> 01:36:57.207
- She seems difficult.
- She is. Very.

01:36:58.208 --> 01:37:00.832
Well, you're putting her
in an ugly situation.

01:37:00.958 --> 01:37:02.832
What with you trying
to have two girlfriends.

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:06.249
That's a tawdry way to phrase it.

01:37:07.333 --> 01:37:08.624
(Ike chuckles) You...

01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:11.665
You have one living in a house
that you share with her in the city

01:37:11.791 --> 01:37:13.540
and another one up here
that you're living with.

01:37:14.666 --> 01:37:16.415
Yeah, I can see the appeal.

01:37:17.250 --> 01:37:19.374
I practically invented it.

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:21.915
But I did it better than you.

01:37:22.541 --> 01:37:24.415
Nobody hated me then.

01:37:24.541 --> 01:37:28.124
I could enjoy it. Until later, of course,
when it all came crashing down.

01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:32.165
But by then, I had
my escape all planned.

01:37:32.291 --> 01:37:35.790
You see, you haven't put enough thought
into something as delicate as this.

01:37:36.541 --> 01:37:39.707
Ever since I was a teenager,
I wanted to fall in love with a French girl.

01:37:39.833 --> 01:37:41.499
(Ike laughs)

01:37:42.666 --> 01:37:44.082
I'm proud of you, boy.

01:37:47.250 --> 01:37:52.499
You'll find yourself
referring to this experience often

01:37:52.625 --> 01:37:56.332
when you opt to pull your head
out of your own ass and get back to work.

01:37:56.458 --> 01:37:58.957
Can you offer any suggestions
about what I should do until then?

01:37:59.666 --> 01:38:01.332
Well, I could.

01:38:02.083 --> 01:38:04.499
But this really belongs to you.

01:38:05.625 --> 01:38:07.374
You'll find a solution.

01:38:08.250 --> 01:38:09.749
I gave you the '25, by the way.

01:38:10.458 --> 01:38:12.082
Oh, thank you.

01:38:13.708 --> 01:38:17.499
The way I see it,
you have two possible scenarios.

01:38:17.625 --> 01:38:20.832
Either you abscond to France
with a girl you just met three months ago,

01:38:20.958 --> 01:38:22.749
thus becoming a cliché,

01:38:22.875 --> 01:38:26.124
leaving the city in disgrace
and your former life in shambles,

01:38:26.250 --> 01:38:30.790
or you'll return to your kind,
successful, tolerant,

01:38:30.916 --> 01:38:34.374
and probably very attractive
girlfriend in the city.

01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:36.165
Immerse yourself in work,

01:38:36.291 --> 01:38:38.999
and become miserable for eternity.

01:38:39.916 --> 01:38:42.999
Two fine options,
as far as you're concerned.

01:38:43.125 --> 01:38:45.457
You're lucky to have them already,
at your age.

01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:55.790
You're a good friend, Ike.

01:38:56.333 --> 01:38:58.249
It's an honour to say
that I know you.

01:39:00.666 --> 01:39:04.290
Don't make yourself any more miserable
than you need to be.

01:39:04.416 --> 01:39:06.082
Leave that to the women you love.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.499
That's what they're
pretty much there for.

01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:12.624
In my experience.

01:39:21.375 --> 01:39:24.457
I believe that I'll need to return home
to the city at some point.

01:39:25.375 --> 01:39:27.790
It's highly likely that I'll realise
I made a huge error,

01:39:27.916 --> 01:39:29.874
at which point I might try
to return to this place

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.082
to see if you'd ever
still care about me.

01:39:33.708 --> 01:39:37.249
I'm fairly certain that what I just said
is exactly what's gonna happen.

01:39:39.250 --> 01:39:42.207
I can't believe you still think
that's your decision to make.

01:39:43.041 --> 01:39:45.749
Just trying stuff out to see
what the right thing to do is.

01:39:55.166 --> 01:39:56.665
Thank you.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.207
(Narrator) 'Philip left the college
much as he arrived,

01:40:05.333 --> 01:40:08.874
'alone and devoid of meaningful connections
with anybody else.

01:40:11.208 --> 01:40:14.999
'His time spent there would come to be
regarded as adequate by the administration,

01:40:15.125 --> 01:40:17.499
'who subsequently invited him back,

01:40:17.625 --> 01:40:19.749
'an offer which he would
repeatedly decline,

01:40:19.875 --> 01:40:21.332
'until he heard several years later

01:40:21.458 --> 01:40:25.582
'that Yvette had gotten a tenure job
at another school further north.

01:40:25.708 --> 01:40:28.124
'He eventually returned to teach
several more semesters

01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:32.207
'at increasingly-irregular intervals
as the publication of his work allowed.'

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.290
(Car starts)

01:42:00.875 --> 01:42:02.290

01:42:15.958 --> 01:42:17.707
My key is broken.

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:24.915
(Narrator) 'He returned home to the city
and was refused decency by Ashley,

01:42:25.041 --> 01:42:27.040
'who had made the decision
that Philip would not be allowed

01:42:27.166 --> 01:42:29.999
'to re-enter either her home or her life,

01:42:30.125 --> 01:42:33.249
'having come to the realisation
that she would no longer invest in somebody

01:42:33.375 --> 01:42:35.999
'who would routinely cause her
to feel terrible.

01:42:36.958 --> 01:42:38.415
'Without so much as noticing,

01:42:38.541 --> 01:42:42.499
'Philip had lapsed into his usual pattern
of destructiveness and self-sabotage,

01:42:42.625 --> 01:42:44.790
'forever ruining
yet another relationship,

01:42:45.666 --> 01:42:49.499
'while Ashley explained all the reasons
he was no longer welcome to Philip,

01:42:49.625 --> 01:42:51.957
'he found himself thinking back
on a quotation,

01:42:52.083 --> 01:42:54.999
'which he had hoped to one day use
as the opening of a novel,

01:42:55.125 --> 01:42:57.332
'or perhaps just a chapter.

01:42:57.458 --> 01:43:01.374
"'Nothing lasts forever," he thought,
"and we both know hearts can change."'

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:02.957
You're wrong.
I know what you need.

01:43:03.083 --> 01:43:06.790
Open the door. Let me show you.
Let me show you that you're wrong.

01:43:08.458 --> 01:43:09.790
It's OK.

01:43:10.708 --> 01:43:12.415
I'm not angry with you anymore.

01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:25.374
(Narrator) 'Philip's thoughts
then turned to Ike,

01:43:25.500 --> 01:43:27.749
'alone in his isolated home
in the woods,

01:43:27.875 --> 01:43:30.082
'a lifetime of enemies
and scorched earth

01:43:30.208 --> 01:43:33.749
'forcing him into a quasi-involuntarily
self-imposed exile.'

01:43:33.875 --> 01:43:35.290
(Typewriter clattering)

01:43:35.416 --> 01:43:38.624
'He recalled the lessons learned
from Ike's novels about character,

01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:40.540
'sense of place and dialogue,

01:43:40.666 --> 01:43:43.874
'before realising that his hero and new friend
had imparted Philip

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.374
'with more than either of them
had realised,

01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:48.665
'for better or worse.

01:43:49.875 --> 01:43:51.540
'Staring down at the small creature,

01:43:51.666 --> 01:43:55.124
'Ashley's emotions were at last
completely hers to control.

01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:58.290
'Gadzookey had a home, food,
and one very good friend,

01:43:58.416 --> 01:44:01.665
'who cared more about him
than anything or anyone else.

01:44:01.791 --> 01:44:03.957
'He needed nothing more
to be content.

01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:13.749
'Rejected by both Ashley and Yvette,
Philip walked off on his own,

01:44:13.875 --> 01:44:16.582
'with only the faintest notion of
where to move forward from this,

01:44:16.708 --> 01:44:18.499
'the low point of his adult life.

01:44:19.916 --> 01:44:22.290
'And while he would remain
close with Ike,

01:44:22.416 --> 01:44:23.957
'a friendship that proved essential

01:44:24.083 --> 01:44:27.707
'to the eventual completion and publication
of several more novels,

01:44:27.833 --> 01:44:31.290
'and later achieve an enviable
level of wealth and success,

01:44:31.416 --> 01:44:36.082
'from this day forward, Philip would never
invest so much of himself in anybody else,

01:44:36.208 --> 01:44:40.999
'instead living the rest of his life unwilling
to so much as consider emotional honesty,

01:44:41.125 --> 01:44:44.165
'and deeply wary of those
who attempted to get close to him,

01:44:44.291 --> 01:44:49.165
'a pattern of behaviour that ultimately
left him an isolated and emotionless spectre,

01:44:49.291 --> 01:44:51.999
'forever remaining a mystery,
even to himself.'
