Well, she's got questions.

38:59.821 --> 39:02.258
Yeah, don't we all?

39:02.949 --> 39:08.390
For what it's worth, my advice...
talk to her.

39:09.916 --> 39:13.072
I would appreciate it if
you didn't say any of this

39:13.097 --> 39:14.561
to anyone else.

39:15.346 --> 39:17.148
It's not my story to tell.

39:18.456 --> 39:19.855
Thank you.

39:19.880 --> 39:22.068
You're welcome, Constable Grant.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.405
Wait.

39:27.410 --> 39:30.327
I think it's time that you
start calling me Nathan.

39:33.258 --> 39:34.916
Elizabeth.

39:41.618 --> 39:44.276
<i>(ROSEMARY) We'll have that
ready for you next week.</i>

39:45.555 --> 39:47.421
I want this style?

39:47.446 --> 39:48.946
It worked!

39:48.971 --> 39:52.272
I am calling this my Fiona Collection.

39:52.297 --> 39:53.963
Well, that has a nice ring to it.

39:53.988 --> 39:55.101
[LAUGHS]

39:55.126 --> 39:56.926
Now, what can I get for you?

39:56.951 --> 39:59.022
You want this one?

40:01.093 --> 40:02.725
You're connected.

40:02.750 --> 40:03.949
Faith?

40:03.974 --> 40:05.874
I wanted to surprise you.

40:05.899 --> 40:07.240
Hmm.

40:08.218 --> 40:10.276
Well you-you certainly did.

40:10.513 --> 40:11.994
<i>How is your father?</i>

40:12.354 --> 40:13.754
[SILENCE]

40:13.899 --> 40:14.997
<i>Faith?</i>

40:15.048 --> 40:20.001
Um, he's on the mend and
so is our relationship,

40:21.775 --> 40:26.007
but... something like
this might take a while.

40:26.260 --> 40:30.018
Well, how much longer are
you planning on staying?

40:30.188 --> 40:32.221
I don't know, Carson.

40:38.234 --> 40:41.523
Mrs. Thornton told me today that
you were asking about grandpa.

40:42.528 --> 40:44.735
Is there something that
you would like to ask me?

40:45.046 --> 40:47.238
Is he a bad guy?

40:47.861 --> 40:49.115
He's in prison.

40:49.140 --> 40:50.285
Why?

40:50.310 --> 40:52.909
Well... Grandpa deceived people.

40:52.934 --> 40:55.234
He thought that that was the only way

40:55.259 --> 40:57.125
he could provide for his family.

40:57.150 --> 40:58.550
Was it?

40:58.575 --> 41:01.209
No. It wasn't.

41:01.234 --> 41:03.963
Is that why you became a Mountie?

41:04.448 --> 41:06.448
To be different than him?

41:13.607 --> 41:15.139
Huh.
