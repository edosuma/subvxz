01:16.400 --> 01:19.517
And in perhaps the most monumental
Supreme Court decision...

01:19.720 --> 01:22.154
...in over 100 years...

01:22.360 --> 01:26.478
And the missiles of this small Mideast
country remain pointed at the...

01:26.680 --> 01:29.399
So until further information
is uncovered...

01:29.600 --> 01:32.398
...scientists will continue
to sift through the giant hole...

01:32.600 --> 01:36.309
...that was, until yesterday,
the Republic of France...

01:36.520 --> 01:39.398
Snidely Whiplash, unhand that now.

01:41.240 --> 01:45.756
Well, they must have had a fine round
of Pin the Tail on the Shoe Salesman...

01:45.960 --> 01:47.916
...up in heaven today.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.869
Middle-aged woman
comes into the shoe store.

01:52.080 --> 01:54.355
She's wearing a blossom hat...

01:54.560 --> 01:58.348
You know, the
"I'm just a cute young girl of 45" look.

01:58.920 --> 02:01.115
- And she's looking
for something cool to wear...

02:01.320 --> 02:04.676
...to a Crosby, Stills & Nash
reunion concert.

02:04.880 --> 02:10.000
So I suggest a nice, recyclable
paper bag to put over her face.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.836
You know, so she can
save the planet two ways.

02:14.400 --> 02:16.675
So she maces me.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.679
But as I lash out blindly...

02:18.880 --> 02:22.077
...I think I clipped her a good one
in the teeth.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.675
So from now on,
she'll be gumming the words...

02:24.880 --> 02:26.836
...to "Teach Your Children."

02:27.840 --> 02:29.193
How was your day, pumpkin?

02:30.600 --> 02:33.353
Daddy, when did you get home?

02:33.640 --> 02:34.868
How was your day?

02:35.240 --> 02:37.708
Well, a... A middle-aged woman
came to the shoe store...

02:37.920 --> 02:39.638
...wearing a blossom hat...

02:39.840 --> 02:43.515
Snidely Whiplash, unhand that horse.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.911
- Hi, honey.
- Oh, hi, Peg.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.270
I wasn't talking to you.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.159
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.112
When's your Daddy getting home?

02:54.840 --> 02:58.753
Oh, hi, honey. Guess what
we're gonna do this evening.

02:59.120 --> 03:03.557
Get naked and try to figure out where
our interesting parts used to be?

03:05.200 --> 03:08.397
Shoes got you down, bunky?
Well, this should cheer you up.

03:08.600 --> 03:12.388
I've invited Marcie and Jefferson over
for a game of Ethical Dilemma.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.751
Oh, a dream come true, by gum.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.349
I actually get the opportunity
to play a board game...

03:18.560 --> 03:21.552
...with two people I can't stand
and Jefferson?

03:24.680 --> 03:27.353
Pardon me while I boogaloo.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.758
Well, it's better than our usual
Friday-night fare...

03:30.960 --> 03:32.837
...sitting around
watching you and Buck...

03:33.040 --> 03:36.032
...play Don't Blame Me, It Was Him.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.878
Now, I'm going over to Marcie's
to steal some potato chips...

03:41.080 --> 03:43.150
...so we have something
to serve them.

03:46.120 --> 03:48.953
Gee, Daddy,
I guess it's true what they say:

03:49.160 --> 03:51.754
Life really does begin at 40.

03:53.640 --> 03:56.996
Well, at least I'm not the only one
with no life around here.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.390
Where is your brother, anyway?

03:59.600 --> 04:00.874
He's out with a girl.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.789
No, I said your brother. You know...
You know, Bud.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.911
I know. He's out with an actual girl.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.998
- No, I was asking about Bud.
- I know.

04:10.200 --> 04:14.352
You could have knocked me over
with the weather, but I tell you...

04:14.560 --> 04:17.028
...it was a real girl. Honest.

04:17.240 --> 04:20.357
There was no blow-up tube
in the back or anything.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.069
Son.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.274
Look, he was out with a real girl.

04:36.160 --> 04:37.275
I'm hurt, Dad.

04:37.480 --> 04:41.632
Well, son, that's what happens when
you lay the Bundy on some babe.

04:42.200 --> 04:46.557
The natural result of 30 seconds
of crazed abandon.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.319
Come on, tell Dad all about it.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.511
- I am totally done with women.
- What?

04:53.720 --> 04:55.631
What, did you get married?

04:58.160 --> 05:00.116
- No, Dad.
- Well, don't worry, son.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.629
Remember, it gets better each time...

05:02.840 --> 05:05.513
...as long as it's never
with the same woman.

05:06.720 --> 05:09.439
Wipe your chin and listen to me, Dad.

05:09.800 --> 05:13.156
As you know, I've been laying this
Grandmaster B thing on all the babes.

05:13.360 --> 05:16.113
Well, finally one bought it
and she took me to this rap club.

05:16.320 --> 05:19.551
Well, I got my hat turned around
and all, and I'm cool, I'm cool.

05:19.760 --> 05:23.036
Until she said, " Hey,
that guy over there is looking at me.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.151
Waste him for me, B."

05:25.360 --> 05:28.079
So I go up to him
and I look him right in the eye.

05:28.760 --> 05:29.988
So, what happened then, son?

05:30.200 --> 05:31.918
Then he stood up.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.990
Next thing I know,
I'm in the tunnel of light...

05:36.200 --> 05:38.475
...with Grandma and Elvis
at the other end.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.871
Grandma and Elvis? You die and go
to International House of Pancakes?

05:47.560 --> 05:50.836
I wish. Instead she brought me home
to meet her dad.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.600
She told him I was a tough
street rapper. He hates rap...

05:53.800 --> 05:56.633
...so suddenly,
there was that tunnel of light again.

05:56.840 --> 05:58.956
I'm telling you, Dad,
I am through with women.

05:59.400 --> 06:03.075
Oh, no. Who's gonna fill them shoes?

06:04.960 --> 06:09.078
Gee, Kel, it's 7:00. Shouldn't you
be cuffed to a radiator by now?

06:13.720 --> 06:17.633
Oh, father,
I have angered the Grand Bastard.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.589
That's Grandmaster.

06:23.880 --> 06:26.599
Or at least it was Grandmaster.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.518
From now on, I'm Bud.

06:28.720 --> 06:32.190
Bud Bundy. Take me for what I am.

06:39.880 --> 06:44.192
Yo, girlie. My bedroom's upstairs.
Word to your mother.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.158
Oh, B, thank you
for not hurting my father.

06:48.640 --> 06:53.031
Well, from the foetal position
I can kill in three different ways.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.991
Word to your father.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.112
You should have seen him,
Mr. Bundy.

06:58.320 --> 07:02.677
All rolled up in a little ball
in the corner, ready to strike.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.791
Anyway, I've got some great news.

07:05.040 --> 07:08.032
What, Mike Tyson
was looking at you funny?

07:08.800 --> 07:10.279
I booked us on a rafting trip.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.631
Down a river the Indians used to call
Kiss Your White Ass Goodbye.

07:18.240 --> 07:23.519
- Lf you think I'm kissing my white ass...
- Oh, please, B. I'd be so grateful.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.073
Let's do it.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.590
Daddy, aren't you gonna
say anything to him?

07:33.800 --> 07:35.392
Well, who am I to give advice?

07:35.600 --> 07:39.036
Another hour, I'll be saying,
"Marcie, it's your spin."

07:40.320 --> 07:42.914
Marcie, it's your spin.

07:47.040 --> 07:50.157
I've landed on Childhood Trauma.

07:51.480 --> 07:55.519
Come on, Marcie.
Share or go to Denial.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.791
Oh, all right.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.958
I remember my puppy Winkums.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.393
Winkums was tied
to the back of my bike.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.993
Hey, Al, another Friday night
and I got a k eg of beer in the back.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.555
Let's go beat the hell
out of somebody...

08:14.760 --> 08:16.796
...pick up a couple
of private-school girls...

08:17.000 --> 08:20.117
...and rock the pleats
right off their skirts.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.870
Will it always be lik e this, Al?

08:25.080 --> 08:28.516
You bet. The boys'll never die.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.590
Al, it's your turn
to move your thimble.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.876
"Get in touch with your feminine side."

08:49.240 --> 08:50.275
Tough break, buddy.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.270
Oh, I'll tell you, Al. It's Friday night...

08:54.480 --> 08:57.631
...I got a cup of herb tea...

08:57.840 --> 08:59.831
...we're with the girls we love...

09:02.680 --> 09:06.229
...and we're playing a game that's sure
to become the next middle-aged craze.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.351
Will it always be like this, Al?

09:08.680 --> 09:11.433
No. No, one day it'll be just like this...

09:11.640 --> 09:15.030
...only we'll be wearing
Depend's undergarments.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.599
That's not your feminine side
speaking.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.519
No, my feminine side
is on the couch watching Oprah...

09:22.720 --> 09:26.918
...and occasionally pushing
aside a breast to scratch my knee.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.352
Bitch.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.755
Now it's my turn.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.800
Oh, please don't let her land
on Sexual Intimacy.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.719
Sexual Intimacy.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.348
Okay.

09:42.560 --> 09:47.315
"If your lover suddenly
was unable to perform anymore...

09:51.640 --> 09:54.313
...and was a shoe salesman...

09:57.000 --> 10:01.437
...and named Al..."
- Oh, come, give me this now.

10:01.640 --> 10:05.633
It couldn't possibly say that.
Oh, my God, it does.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.229
"...and an old lover
came back to town..."

10:11.440 --> 10:13.396
I guess they mean Jim.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.509
"...would you have a sleazy affair
with him?"

10:20.720 --> 10:22.438
Yeah.

10:28.680 --> 10:32.309
Well, I did it. I survived the river.

10:32.520 --> 10:35.398
I never felt so alive.
The rush of the water...

10:35.600 --> 10:38.672
...the feeling of flight
as you're launched out of the boat...

10:39.880 --> 10:41.757
...and the good,
clean crack of a pelvis...

10:41.960 --> 10:44.520
...as it meets one of nature's
finest pointy rocks.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.715
And as I lay there clinging for
dear life, I couldn't help but notice...

10:49.920 --> 10:54.471
...the beauty of nature as it sat
on my chest, pecking at my eyes.

10:56.440 --> 11:00.069
It thought it could carry me to
its young ones, but the joke was on it...

11:00.280 --> 11:02.350
...because I was too heavy
and it dropped me...

11:02.560 --> 11:06.314
...in part of the river the Indians
used to call Nutcracker Falls.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.236
But at least you weren't with them.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.511
Yeah, but you people are old.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.352
I still have needs.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.232
From now on, it's life without girls.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.908
I'm through with them.
I mean it this time.

11:24.360 --> 11:25.998
Hello.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.838
Yeah.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.118
Of course.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.189
Well, that was Kara.

11:35.760 --> 11:39.435
She asked me to jump out
of an airplane tomorrow and I said yes.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.713
Good night.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.998
Oh, good.

11:57.440 --> 12:00.876
Daddy, why are you standing up
against the wall?

12:01.720 --> 12:04.837
Well, it's a...
It's an adult thing, pumpkin.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.793
You... You wouldn't understand.
You see, l...

12:08.000 --> 12:10.560
I landed on
the Loneliness Of Adolescence.

12:10.760 --> 12:14.878
So your mother yelled at me
and took my wallet, and I sassed her...

12:15.080 --> 12:18.914
...and well, here I am
stuck in Shame on You Land.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.035
Really cool, Dad.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.558
Pumpkin...

12:23.760 --> 12:27.912
...before you go out and spread this
all around, can I ask you something?

12:28.400 --> 12:30.550
What's it like to have a life?

12:30.960 --> 12:35.317
Well, people think being young and
beautiful is exciting and everything...

12:35.520 --> 12:37.078
...but actually it's pretty boring.

12:37.280 --> 12:38.793
I mean, take today for example.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.752
There I am in the mall,
and this guy...

12:40.960 --> 12:43.474
...some geezer rock star,
steps on my foot.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.079
You know, that Springsteen guy?

12:45.640 --> 12:46.595
The Boss?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.153
Well, I don't think so, Daddy.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.555
His wife seemed to be
the one in charge.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.994
Well, anyhow,
it was downhill from there.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.033
There I am, hitching a ride,
and who should pick me up?

12:57.240 --> 12:58.992
The Swedish bikini team.

13:00.520 --> 13:04.069
They wanted to drive me home, come in
for a beer, but I've heard you say...

13:04.280 --> 13:07.238
...you didn't like people
drinking your beers.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.198
Your time's up, Al.

13:10.880 --> 13:12.632
I know.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.314
So then Ernie Banks comes...

13:14.840 --> 13:17.718
Pumpkin, could you
go wait for the mail?

13:18.160 --> 13:20.151
Okey-dokey.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.559
Oh, Daddy,
if it makes you feel any better...

13:27.760 --> 13:31.469
...you're a lot younger than the guy the
bikini team ended up going home with.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.432
Your spin, Al.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.279
Al landed on Caring.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.232
I mean... I mean, I'm trying to win...

13:44.440 --> 13:48.149
...but I keep landing on
Date a Kennedy, Lose a Turn.

13:52.280 --> 13:54.999
Tell us what you care about, honey.

13:57.680 --> 14:00.433
"I Care" by Al Bundy.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.119
When hooters jiggle around

14:08.600 --> 14:11.910
And I find nick els on the ground,
I care

14:12.120 --> 14:17.114
When a Mustang engine purrs
And the bathroom is not hers

14:17.320 --> 14:19.038
I care

14:19.240 --> 14:23.597
When the pitcher's on the mound
And the wife is underground

14:25.640 --> 14:27.232
I care

14:27.440 --> 14:29.317
But when I've been playing this for days

14:29.520 --> 14:33.195
I will kill anyone who stays,
I swear.

14:40.520 --> 14:45.389
And if you really want a scare
Check out his underwear

14:46.600 --> 14:49.114
If you dare

14:50.320 --> 14:53.278
Well, I'm going to jump
out of an airplane now...

14:53.480 --> 14:55.391
...and plummet to my death.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.397
Basically for nothing.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.828
Just wanted to say goodbye.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.958
Hey.

15:05.440 --> 15:08.159
Hey, Al's not moving his thimble
down the Path to Intimacy.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.075
Gee, that's a first.

15:11.320 --> 15:14.471
I'm using my
Get-Out-of-Sexual-Intimacy card free.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.314
You have to say it before you spin.

15:18.520 --> 15:20.192
- Drop dead.
- Bite me.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.675
I'm glad I caught you,
Thumb-sucker B.

15:24.880 --> 15:28.839
Listen, it's time that we had
a little boy-girl talk.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.871
Now, let's pretend that you're the boy.

15:31.080 --> 15:32.877
Okay. Okay, I'm number 27.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.719
Do I get in line
behind the sailors over there?

15:37.240 --> 15:40.357
Look, I'm just trying
to help you, drippy.

15:41.320 --> 15:42.753
Now let me tell you about women.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.791
I already know about women, Kel.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.515
Yes, but there's more to us than just
"Inflate until feet start to plump."

15:50.600 --> 15:54.036
Now, as we both know,
you are doing this for sex.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.832
But let me tell you something.

15:56.040 --> 15:59.874
It doesn't matter what a guy does
or says or how he treats us.

16:00.080 --> 16:03.516
The second we see a guy, we already
know whether or not he's gonna get sex.

16:03.720 --> 16:07.235
Which, by the way, explains
why you've never gotten any.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.673
If that was even close to true...

16:09.880 --> 16:12.394
...do you think
I could still hold my head up?

16:15.440 --> 16:20.309
Look, all I'm saying is that if she hasn't
let you touch her yet, she never will.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.034
If you still feel the need
to do something dangerous...

16:23.240 --> 16:25.276
...throw out your Clearasil.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.796
Like I'm gonna take the advice
of someone...

16:30.000 --> 16:33.231
...who's fooled by every single
disguise of the Trix rabbit.

16:37.760 --> 16:42.197
Yeah, like you know who he is
until his ears flop out.

16:44.440 --> 16:45.793
But I do know this.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.958
You can jump out of a plane
and go hurtling to your death...

16:49.160 --> 16:50.434
...but mark my words.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.791
You will not even get
a cheap feel out of this.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.197
You will die a flat virgin.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.953
Kel, you're wrong. And besides...

17:01.160 --> 17:04.435
...if jumping out of a plane with
almost no training was dangerous...

17:04.640 --> 17:07.154
...don't you think my parents
would have stopped me?

17:07.359 --> 17:10.875
Hey, everyone, Al got a Cuddle card.

17:14.280 --> 17:17.477
I played high school football,
for God's sake.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.714
So does anybody
have any questions...

17:26.920 --> 17:29.309
...in case we get tangled up
in power lines?

17:33.840 --> 17:35.193
Yes?

17:35.400 --> 17:37.868
Is there any way to get out of them
and still live?

17:38.080 --> 17:42.312
No, not with the piddly training
you guys have had.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.752
That's how I like it.

17:45.960 --> 17:50.033
You're so brave, Grandmaster B.
You're all I ever wanted in a man.

17:50.240 --> 17:54.233
My last boyfriend was so boring.
All we did was make love.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.510
What a loser.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.117
Oh, I'm definitely not doing this.

18:01.320 --> 18:04.551
No way, no how, never.
Not for anything.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.916
Oh, Daddy.

18:10.080 --> 18:12.355
Look at those hooters.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.676
I'm doing it.

18:18.360 --> 18:20.794
Well, we're just about ready to go.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.195
Remember,
I'll be jumping out with you...

18:23.400 --> 18:26.039
...and we'll be in radio contact
all the way down.

18:26.240 --> 18:28.435
You know,
so I can give you instructions.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.959
Just in case.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.071
Any questions?

18:32.440 --> 18:34.237
Yes.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.158
Just in case of what?

18:36.360 --> 18:39.670
Like if your parachute doesn't open.
If it gets tangled up in itself.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.108
If there's a hole in it...

18:41.320 --> 18:44.676
...or if we just forgot
to put one in the pack.

18:45.200 --> 18:47.350
Well, let's go.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.039
Wait. Wait a minute.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.629
Now, aren't these guys gonna go first?

18:51.840 --> 18:54.115
Oh, they backed out.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.110
They're not with girls.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.319
This is so exciting.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.592
My whole body feels like it's on fire.

19:03.240 --> 19:07.392
Well, before mine is, upon impact...

19:07.600 --> 19:09.955
...how about just one last kiss?

19:10.160 --> 19:12.833
Which means one first kiss.

19:13.640 --> 19:17.269
Which means one last kiss for luck.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.633
All right, one kiss for my hero.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.876
All right, Bundy.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.875
How you doing, Bud?

19:39.680 --> 19:42.148
Bud, this is Kara. How are you?

19:42.360 --> 19:46.592
Couldn't be calmer, babe. Could you
put the instructor back on, please?

19:46.800 --> 19:48.358
Sure.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.278
Bud?

19:53.360 --> 19:55.920
That's right. Just enjoy the free fall.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.156
I'm watching you all the way.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.557
Oh, man, what fun.

20:00.760 --> 20:04.469
Okay, I've had enough now.
Listen, this is Grandmaster 1 here.

20:04.680 --> 20:06.989
Should I be concerned
I'm plummeting to my death...

20:07.200 --> 20:08.599
...over Lake Michigan? Over.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.313
Yes.

20:10.520 --> 20:12.272
But stay calm. I'll talk you in.

20:12.480 --> 20:16.598
Alls you have to do is...
Say, Kara, you're cute.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.189
Thank you. You're cute too.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.836
The second I saw you,
I knew we were going to have sex.

20:26.680 --> 20:29.069
Instructor, Grandmaster 1 here.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.875
Listen, I seem to be heading
towards the smokestack of a tugboat.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.833
Could use some last-minute advice.
Over.

20:36.040 --> 20:39.430
Tak e me, Biff. Tak e me now.

20:39.640 --> 20:42.029
But I thought we were gonna jump.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.835
Can you look at these
and still think of jumping?

20:47.960 --> 20:51.236
Instructor? Kara?

20:51.440 --> 20:54.193
Mommy!

20:56.680 --> 21:01.515
His eyes, his chest, his butt.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.629
What else would you change
about him?

21:06.560 --> 21:09.677
Well, certainly you wouldn't want him
to keep those teeth.

21:09.880 --> 21:14.192
Please, Jefferson,
he's sitting right in front of us.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.198
But I would like to change
that birthmark on his tush...

21:17.400 --> 21:19.868
...shaped like Woody Allen.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.358
Death can't be this busy.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.640
The sparrow has landed.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.432
Did you get any?

21:33.120 --> 21:37.193
Yes, if you count mouth-to-mouth
from a drunken sea captain.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.348
But I've learned a couple of things
from all this.

21:40.560 --> 21:44.109
One, there's nothing
a pelican won't eat.

21:45.800 --> 21:49.679
And two, I am finally, totally,
completely finished with women.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.596
Wait, let us not forget number three.

21:52.800 --> 21:54.756
That I was right. Say it.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.520
- No.
- That's all I needed to hear.

21:58.840 --> 21:59.795
But I tell you this:

22:00.000 --> 22:02.560
Next time a girl comes to me
and wants me to do something stupid...

22:02.760 --> 22:05.035
- You'll do it?
- You betcha.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.709
You know what? For a million dollars
I'd never jump out of an airplane.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.514
Al, you landed on Kiss the Neighbour.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.676
Don't you want
your last-minute instructions?
