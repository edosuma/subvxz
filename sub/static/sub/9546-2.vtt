00:12.297 --> 00:15.230
The longest garbage strike
in the history of San Francisco

00:15.247 --> 00:18.563
continues and there is still
no end in sight.

00:18.597 --> 00:22.430
On every street corner,
the trash continues to pile up.

00:22.563 --> 00:25.580
Negociations between the city
and the sanitation workers

00:25.638 --> 00:27.504
have completly broken down.

00:27.792 --> 00:29.901
<i>So, how are residents coping?</i>

00:29.934 --> 00:32.667
<i>Well, so far, the people
of San Francisco can be</i>

00:32.701 --> 00:34.567
very proud of themselves.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.367
<i>No one is panicking.</i>

00:36.408 --> 00:39.730
<i>In fact, it seems everybody
is rising to the occasion,</i>

00:39.761 --> 00:43.709
coming together, and taking
this latest crisis in stride.

00:43.735 --> 00:44.730
See?

00:44.767 --> 00:45.961
That's better, right?

00:47.136 --> 00:48.863
No! Please, not incent.

00:48.937 --> 00:50.753
That smells worse
than the garbage.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.782
Okay, fine,
I'll put it out.

00:54.807 --> 00:56.063
Natalie.

00:56.105 --> 00:57.331
What am I gonna do?

00:57.816 --> 00:59.561
The whole city reeks.

00:59.667 --> 01:01.200
I'm starting to get used to it.

01:01.468 --> 01:03.032
You are? Really?

01:03.536 --> 01:05.400
Then, you're gonna love hell.

01:06.837 --> 01:07.863
All right, look, listen.

01:07.907 --> 01:09.333
I-I-I gotta get outta town.

01:09.367 --> 01:10.733
Let's just get in the car.

01:10.767 --> 01:12.562
And go somewhere upwind,
please.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.562
Mr. Monk, I can't just leave.
I have Julie here.

01:14.607 --> 01:16.363
It's a school week.
We'll take her with us.

01:16.437 --> 01:17.702
I'll teach the girl.

01:17.736 --> 01:19.030
I'll tutor the girl.

01:19.136 --> 01:20.933
She's not up to fractions,
yet, is she?

01:20.967 --> 01:23.583
Listen. Listen.
It's a truck.

01:24.266 --> 01:26.361
That sounds like
a garbage truck, right?

01:26.406 --> 01:28.101
Mr. Monk, it's not
a garbage truck.

01:28.136 --> 01:29.881
They've settled the strike.
It's all over!

01:29.915 --> 01:31.402
T-turn on the news.

01:32.207 --> 01:33.862
Uh. False alarm.

01:33.907 --> 01:35.432
It's a...bus.

01:36.465 --> 01:37.652
<i>All we want--</i>

01:37.716 --> 01:40.312
<i>All we've ever wanted
is a fair contract</i>

01:40.367 --> 01:42.581
<i>for ourselves
and for our families.</i>

01:43.257 --> 01:45.150
This union is
willing to stay out

01:45.187 --> 01:46.963
for as long as it takes.

01:47.005 --> 01:49.383
<i>Two weeks!
Two months!</i>

01:49.865 --> 01:51.581
We will never back down!

01:52.205 --> 01:53.811
We will never surrender!

01:54.207 --> 01:55.703
It's all his fault.

01:56.137 --> 01:57.633
Jimmy Cusack.

01:58.036 --> 02:00.293
Hate that guy.
Wish he was dead.

02:00.585 --> 02:01.601
Don't say that.

02:01.637 --> 02:03.091
I do.
I wish he was dead.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.540
What if something
happened to him?

02:04.557 --> 02:06.061
- You'd feel terrible.
- No, I wouldn't.

02:06.106 --> 02:07.400
- Yeah, you would.
- No. I wouldn't.

02:07.438 --> 02:08.382
Yeah, you would.

02:08.437 --> 02:09.650
<i>...is very much for real</i>

02:09.765 --> 02:11.700
<i>and shows no signs
of coming to an end.</i>

02:19.607 --> 02:21.603
Oh, Mr. Cusack,
I didn't see you.

02:23.337 --> 02:24.763
<i>Mr. Cusack?</i>

02:34.765 --> 02:36.503
* It's a jungle out there

02:36.958 --> 02:39.630
* Disorder and confusion
everywhere *

02:41.317 --> 02:43.450
* No one seems to care

02:43.508 --> 02:44.702
* Well, I do

02:44.735 --> 02:47.553
* Hey, who's in charge here?

02:47.638 --> 02:49.651
* It's a jungle out there

02:51.507 --> 02:53.953
* Poison in the very air
we breathe *

02:54.737 --> 02:57.003
* You know what's in
the water that you drink? *

02:57.265 --> 03:01.500
* Well, I do,
and it's a-ma-zing *

03:01.535 --> 03:04.710
* People think I'm crazy
'cause I wry all the time *

03:04.906 --> 03:07.763
* If you paid attention,
you'd be worried too *

03:08.188 --> 03:12.032
* You'd better pay attention
or this world love so much *

03:12.438 --> 03:15.553
* Might just kill you

03:16.215 --> 03:18.083
* I could be wrong now

03:18.538 --> 03:20.213
* But, I don't think so

03:20.308 --> 03:22.412
* 'Cause it's
a jungle out there *

03:23.055 --> 03:24.780
* It's a jungle
out there *

03:38.005 --> 03:39.061
You called for pick-up?

03:39.108 --> 03:40.100
Yeah!
Thank you.

03:40.138 --> 03:42.351
Right there.
Thank you.

03:44.935 --> 03:46.453
<i>Watch the woodwork.</i>

03:48.565 --> 03:50.033
There's no address on these.

03:50.065 --> 03:51.133
I know.

03:51.167 --> 03:53.103
Just send 'em anywhere.
It doesn't matter.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.711
We can't just send 'em
anywhere, sir.

03:54.756 --> 03:55.802
We gotta have an address.

03:55.836 --> 03:58.132
Don't you guys have
a...depot...place?

03:58.165 --> 04:00.030
So, you can just 'em
in a corner?

04:00.067 --> 04:01.361
"Put 'em in a corner"?

04:01.406 --> 04:02.603
O-Okay, okay.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.482
All right, uh--

04:07.407 --> 04:08.960
What--uh,  what's your address?

04:09.807 --> 04:11.513
- Have a nice day, sir.
- <i>All right, okay!</i>

04:11.555 --> 04:12.603
<i>All right.
Okay, hold on.</i>

04:12.657 --> 04:13.632
Hold on.

04:13.866 --> 04:15.162
Hold on.

04:15.205 --> 04:16.730
Okay, just a second.

04:18.916 --> 04:20.031
All right.

04:20.067 --> 04:21.202
Okay, there it is.

04:21.238 --> 04:22.312
There's--there's--

04:22.915 --> 04:24.553
There's the address.

04:24.957 --> 04:26.661
And that's
where you send it.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.031
Right there.

04:30.535 --> 04:32.303
<i>Thank you very--
Watch the woodwork.</i>

04:32.866 --> 04:33.833
<i>Watch the trim.</i>

04:40.168 --> 04:41.333
What were you doing?

04:41.365 --> 04:42.462
Nothing.
Nothing...

04:43.605 --> 04:44.600
Where's your garbage?

04:46.065 --> 04:47.903
Did you just mail
your garbage to somebody?

04:48.207 --> 04:50.001
These are desperate times,
Natalie.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.362
Desperate times.

04:52.037 --> 04:53.052
What?

04:53.116 --> 04:54.130
Are you happy?

04:54.418 --> 04:55.530
No.

05:01.865 --> 05:02.940
Got your wish.

05:05.106 --> 05:06.433
<i>Wha--?
No.</i>

05:06.465 --> 05:07.902
Y-you think I did this?

05:07.938 --> 05:09.132
Yeah. I think you did.

05:09.167 --> 05:10.333
With your karma!

05:10.368 --> 05:11.851
<i>You  said
you wanted the guy dead.</i>

05:11.866 --> 05:14.261
I was joking.
It's a figure of speech.

05:14.318 --> 05:16.363
Mr. Monk, you need to be
careful what you wish for.

05:17.157 --> 05:19.960
Because of his death, the union
has stopped all negotiations.

05:20.038 --> 05:21.030
Nobody's talking.

05:21.067 --> 05:22.633
The strike's gonna go on
for years.

05:23.338 --> 05:24.363
Good job.

05:28.705 --> 05:30.363
Union! Union!

05:30.408 --> 05:32.480
Union! Union!

05:32.565 --> 05:35.832
- Union! Union!
- I've known Jimmy Cusack--

05:36.685 --> 05:39.333
I've known Jimmy Cusack
my whole life.

05:39.687 --> 05:42.131
His old man and
my old man came up together.

05:42.165 --> 05:43.853
They rode the same truck.

05:44.508 --> 05:46.032
Now, Jimmy had a temper.

05:46.068 --> 05:47.800
And Jimmy had his problems.

05:48.185 --> 05:50.530
But he was not suicidal.
No way, no how!

05:53.205 --> 05:54.681
<i>Now, Mayor Nicholson</i>

05:54.755 --> 05:57.102
and his lap dogs down
at the police department...

05:57.868 --> 06:00.360
They're telling us
the case is closed.

06:03.058 --> 06:04.750
Here's what we say.

06:05.268 --> 06:07.010
Mayor Nickelson,
you can go to hell!

06:15.105 --> 06:16.133
You...

06:18.855 --> 06:20.003
Hello.

06:22.067 --> 06:23.363
My name--

06:23.405 --> 06:25.501
My name is Adrian Monk.

06:27.701 --> 06:32.059
<i>I-I am not technically
a sanitation worker.</i>

06:32.535 --> 06:35.360
Although, I have always
felt like one.

06:35.587 --> 06:37.131
In spirit...

06:38.437 --> 06:40.682
I recognize a lot of you.

06:41.608 --> 06:43.401
<i>Ronnie, Morris.</i>

06:43.567 --> 06:44.880
Excuse me, sir?

06:45.087 --> 06:46.432
We  appreciate your support.

06:46.746 --> 06:48.060
But this is a closed meeting.

06:48.416 --> 06:49.531
I-I won't be long.

06:49.565 --> 06:51.310
I just wanted to say--

06:52.638 --> 06:54.830
You've made your point.

06:55.305 --> 06:57.380
Congratulations!
We get it now.

06:58.505 --> 07:01.060
You can all go back to work.
Union!

07:01.107 --> 07:03.332
Now, w-w-wait a minute.
What about our contract?

07:05.437 --> 07:07.451
Okay, I know money is important.

07:07.605 --> 07:09.001
<i>Damn right.</i>

07:10.636 --> 07:14.832
But, that's not why you guys
became garbage men, is it?

07:15.708 --> 07:18.233
You're doing
God's work out there.

07:18.388 --> 07:21.000
You're keeping the streets
clean for the people.

07:21.556 --> 07:22.602
<i>Right?</i>

07:22.768 --> 07:24.631
You do it--
Say it with me--

07:25.356 --> 07:27.453
For the people.

07:28.318 --> 07:30.232
<i>Oh, and let me
tell you something.</i>

07:30.265 --> 07:32.962
The people are suffering.

07:34.806 --> 07:36.682
The people--

07:38.668 --> 07:41.112
People are going a little nuts
out there.

07:44.165 --> 07:50.312
The people...can't wash
the stink off their hands.

07:50.708 --> 07:53.452
<i>The people are having trouble
sleeping.</i>

07:53.938 --> 07:56.300
People woke up
this morning at 5:00.

07:56.335 --> 07:58.763
Couldn't get back to sleep
because--

07:59.788 --> 08:03.862
Smelled like a buffalo had died
in the people's closets!

08:05.735 --> 08:07.133
Sir, excuse me.

08:07.167 --> 08:08.561
<i>Excuse me, sir?</i>

08:08.968 --> 08:10.700
Are you Adrian Monk,
the detective?

08:12.067 --> 08:13.283
Y-yeah, that's right.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.001
We've heard a lot about you,
Mr. Monk.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.600
You're a great detective
and from what we can tell,

08:17.635 --> 08:18.702
you're an honest man.

08:18.716 --> 08:19.883
You're on your own, right?

08:19.965 --> 08:21.452
You're not working
for the cops?

08:21.505 --> 08:23.753
I'm a private consultant.
Well, good.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.733
Then, you'll be
an objective voice.

08:26.225 --> 08:27.270
We wanna hire you.

08:27.327 --> 08:28.383
Hire me?

08:28.467 --> 08:30.831
We want you to look into
what happened to Jimmy Cusack.

08:30.866 --> 08:33.530
If you say it's a suicide,
that'll be good enough for us.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.730
We'll go back
to the bargaining table.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.751
I'm pretty sure
it was a suicide.

08:40.885 --> 08:42.283
How can you tell?

08:42.355 --> 08:44.100
Don't you have to,
you know, look around?

08:44.168 --> 08:45.233
Investigate?

08:45.418 --> 08:46.580
Yeah...

08:47.058 --> 08:48.333
That's right.

09:01.536 --> 09:03.630
Jimmy Cusack was sitting there.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.960
Yup.

09:07.057 --> 09:08.081
Okay.

09:12.355 --> 09:13.463
<i>But, there was...</i>

09:13.956 --> 09:16.801
somebody else... here.

09:22.506 --> 09:25.352
And they--
he had his feet up.

09:26.945 --> 09:28.932
<i>And he ate all the cashews.</i>

09:29.476 --> 09:30.592
What does that mean?

09:33.267 --> 09:35.760
He probably liked
the cashews the best.

09:42.337 --> 09:43.561
- Damn...
- You okay?

09:43.605 --> 09:44.663
Yeah, I just--

09:44.936 --> 09:47.363
I'm just--just hard to think.

09:47.657 --> 09:49.062
It's the smell.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.161
It's the smell.

09:53.405 --> 09:56.162
Okay.
Give me the timeline.

09:56.458 --> 09:57.862
<i>I've got it right here.</i>

09:58.368 --> 10:00.500
<i>Now, Cusack was last seen alive</i>

10:00.535 --> 10:03.350
in here sitting at his desk
at around 9:30.

10:03.555 --> 10:06.861
<i>Cleaning crew found him
this morning at 7:00.</i>

10:07.205 --> 10:09.801
Our coroner said the body had
been cold about seven hours.

10:10.008 --> 10:11.352
So, midnight...

10:11.957 --> 10:15.080
Was he upset about something
or--or depressed?

10:16.305 --> 10:18.561
Besides the whole city
hating his guts,

10:18.608 --> 10:20.301
as a matter of fact, he was.

10:20.507 --> 10:21.510
Ron!

10:21.587 --> 10:22.630
<i>This is Ron Nealy.</i>

10:22.666 --> 10:24.701
<i>He's the chief accountant
with the union.</i>

10:25.306 --> 10:26.403
Adrian Monk.

10:26.438 --> 10:28.403
<i>I was, uh, going through
the books yesterday,</i>

10:28.437 --> 10:30.131
<i>getting ready for the next
round of talks,</i>

10:30.185 --> 10:32.463
and I found
a few... irregularities.

10:32.668 --> 10:35.462
300 grand from the pension fund
went poof.

10:35.655 --> 10:38.163
-  304.2, actually.
- Yeah.

10:38.208 --> 10:39.932
I called Jimmy about midnight

10:39.965 --> 10:41.060
<i>and asked him about it.</i>

10:41.105 --> 10:42.300
What--what did he say?

10:42.405 --> 10:43.600
<i>He kind of groaned.</i>

10:43.885 --> 10:47.100
And then he said,
"What took you so long?"

10:48.965 --> 10:50.162
That--

10:50.208 --> 10:52.251
That sounds like suicide.

10:52.356 --> 10:54.502
But, you are
the independent investigator

10:54.515 --> 10:56.903
and you have to decide
for yourself.

10:59.408 --> 11:00.831
I'm gonna say suicide.

11:00.868 --> 11:03.512
- Suicide it is.
- Thank you, Mr. Nealy.

11:06.808 --> 11:07.931
That was easy.

11:07.966 --> 11:09.330
Wait.

11:09.366 --> 11:11.630
No.
You haven't even looked around.

11:11.666 --> 11:13.333
- I did. I looked around.
- No.

11:13.366 --> 11:15.453
You didn't do the thing.
You know.

11:16.268 --> 11:17.762
With your hands.

11:18.667 --> 11:20.131
With your hands...

11:21.267 --> 11:22.533
Come on.

11:24.607 --> 11:25.850
Come on.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.083
He  was left-handed?

11:55.905 --> 11:57.903
<i>He's holding the gun
in his right hand.</i>

11:58.265 --> 12:00.380
His left hand was bandaged.

12:01.207 --> 12:02.301
So, he--

12:02.335 --> 12:05.263
He probably...
sprained his wrist

12:06.186 --> 12:08.350
and couldn't hold
the gun in his left.

12:22.487 --> 12:23.681
What, what?

12:24.308 --> 12:27.232
The bullet hole
and the blood spatter.

12:27.568 --> 12:31.351
He must have been sitting
all the way back in this chair.

12:32.466 --> 12:35.560
How did he...
raise his arm?

12:35.806 --> 12:37.263
There's no room.

12:49.106 --> 12:50.912
These are the bullets
from the gun.

12:51.056 --> 12:52.031
That's strange.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.033
- What?
- No fingerprints.

12:54.867 --> 12:56.451
They've been wiped clean.

12:58.117 --> 13:02.401
So, why would anyone
who's about to kill himself...

13:04.607 --> 13:07.250
wipe the fingerprints
off the bullets?

13:08.465 --> 13:11.731
Wait. What are you saying?
It was murder?

13:15.935 --> 13:16.961
Yeah.

13:19.267 --> 13:20.632
<i>Captain, Captain!</i>

13:20.667 --> 13:21.800
<i>Captain!</i>

13:24.816 --> 13:26.261
Mr. Monk, who hired you?

13:26.496 --> 13:30.383
Well, the sanitation union asked
me to look at the evidence.

13:30.436 --> 13:32.350
And what do you think?
Was the coroner right?

13:32.365 --> 13:33.431
Well--

13:36.907 --> 13:39.632
Mr. Monk, was this suicide
or murder?

13:41.286 --> 13:42.560
No, no, no, no.

13:42.607 --> 13:43.663
There was no murder.

13:43.705 --> 13:45.501
This is definitely suicide.

13:46.065 --> 13:47.881
Well, let's try
and get everybody

13:47.958 --> 13:49.853
back to the bargaining table

13:49.956 --> 13:52.161
and get all this garbage
off the street.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.431
Okay, well, thank you.

14:03.645 --> 14:05.861
Of course there will be
a formal inquest.

14:05.905 --> 14:08.000
But, as of this moment,
the police department

14:08.036 --> 14:11.002
is completely satisfied that
union president Jimmy Cusack

14:11.037 --> 14:12.931
died by his own hand.

14:12.966 --> 14:15.662
Now that conclusion has just
been verified by Adrian Monk,

14:15.707 --> 14:17.733
a distinguished
independent investigator.

14:17.766 --> 14:19.010
Captain! Captain!

14:19.038 --> 14:20.602
So, you're saying
the case is closed?

14:20.667 --> 14:23.181
It is. As far as I'm concerned,
the case is closed.

14:23.257 --> 14:24.380
Thank you.

14:58.306 --> 14:59.460
What?

14:59.508 --> 15:00.821
You know what.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.622
Mr. Monk, I'm so....

15:03.737 --> 15:05.103
disappointed in you.

15:05.495 --> 15:06.771
What took you so long?

15:06.798 --> 15:08.402
<i>Mr. Monk,
you lied back there.</i>

15:08.447 --> 15:09.801
About a murder case!

15:09.886 --> 15:10.953
Oh, great.

15:11.105 --> 15:12.163
Okay, look.

15:12.967 --> 15:15.430
<i>I'm not 100% sure it was murder.</i>

15:15.578 --> 15:16.930
It could have been suicide.

15:17.098 --> 15:18.432
Detective Thurber agrees
with me.

15:18.457 --> 15:19.552
Mr. Monk, I was with you.

15:19.595 --> 15:21.010
You showed me
all the evidence--

15:21.056 --> 15:22.370
the--the blood on the chair,

15:22.415 --> 15:23.772
no fingerprints
on the bullets--

15:23.815 --> 15:26.452
Natalie, obviously,
you don't understand.

15:28.498 --> 15:30.662
Some things are bigger
than the truth.

15:30.706 --> 15:31.700
Like what?

15:31.768 --> 15:34.863
Like that mountain
of garbage out...there!

15:36.137 --> 15:39.633
<i>The truth is buried alive
out there.</i>

15:41.466 --> 15:43.061
Look at me.
Seriously.

15:43.106 --> 15:45.151
I don't think that I can work
for a dishonest man.

15:45.197 --> 15:46.672
It was for the greater good.

15:46.755 --> 15:48.361
You've heard of that, right?

15:48.456 --> 15:50.353
The greater good?
Turn on the news!

15:51.215 --> 15:54.902
They resume negotiations.
Everybody's talking again.

15:55.168 --> 15:56.882
I am the hero here.

15:58.016 --> 15:59.781
You are not a hero, Mr. Monk.

16:00.055 --> 16:01.522
You are letting
a killer go free

16:01.586 --> 16:03.253
<i>so you can get
your garbage picked up.</i>

16:03.285 --> 16:05.040
Okay, Natalie.

16:05.705 --> 16:08.081
Let me explain one more time.

16:08.565 --> 16:10.011
About the greater good.

16:12.656 --> 16:14.090
<i>You think I'm joking, Mr. Monk.</i>

16:14.155 --> 16:17.160
I'm not kidding, okay?
Now, come on!

16:17.586 --> 16:19.243
Okay, now--now not
a good time.

16:19.266 --> 16:20.800
Okay, you know what?
This is enough!

16:20.847 --> 16:22.862
- I know you think that I'm kidding.
- I can't just go in there--

16:22.896 --> 16:24.293
- <i>I'm not gonna show up tomorrow.
- Can I help you?</i>

16:24.337 --> 16:25.322
This is it!

16:27.835 --> 16:29.003
- All right.
- Tell him.

16:29.058 --> 16:30.380
Okay. All right.

16:40.715 --> 16:41.791
What?

16:45.135 --> 16:46.311
It was a murder.

16:46.357 --> 16:47.551
Louder!

16:48.086 --> 16:49.350
It was murder.

16:50.088 --> 16:52.753
You're not talking about
the Jimmy Cusack case, are you?

16:52.786 --> 16:54.910
Yeah, Mr. Monk here saw
some stuff at the crime scene

16:54.957 --> 16:56.423
he's failed to mention.

16:56.627 --> 16:58.140
He thinks it's a homicide.

16:58.237 --> 16:59.970
It was for the G.G.

17:00.968 --> 17:03.010
The greater good!
The G.G.

17:03.468 --> 17:04.651
Captain, it was--

17:04.977 --> 17:06.492
The stench out there.

17:06.785 --> 17:09.073
The stench!
I-I can't think straight.

17:09.307 --> 17:12.212
<i>A smell like that can kill!</i>

17:12.825 --> 17:14.983
People die from smells
every day.

17:15.207 --> 17:16.363
That's a fact.

17:19.507 --> 17:21.353
- That is a beautiful suit.
- Monk!

17:21.416 --> 17:23.313
<i>20 minutes ago
I went on the record</i>

17:23.357 --> 17:24.790
defending your suicide theory.

17:24.858 --> 17:27.172
I was on TV!
My name was across the screen.

17:27.236 --> 17:28.530
I'm gonna look like an idiot.

17:28.578 --> 17:30.441
Call--call Larry Cutler
at the mayor's office.

17:30.486 --> 17:31.980
Get him on the phone right now.

17:32.186 --> 17:33.460
- Dial faster.
- I'm dialing.

17:33.527 --> 17:34.551
Dial like the wind!

17:34.618 --> 17:36.403
- Are you happy now?
- Someone had to do it.

17:36.466 --> 17:38.003
Larry, hey, it's Randy Disher.

17:38.067 --> 17:39.113
Hey, Larry.

17:39.157 --> 17:40.813
I'm here with Adrian Monk.

17:41.148 --> 17:42.723
Listen, he's having
second thoughts

17:42.768 --> 17:44.222
about the Jimmy Cusack suicide.

17:44.287 --> 17:46.912
- Why do I have to be so good?
- I know...

17:46.978 --> 17:49.853
Why can't I be like
a regular detective like--

17:54.837 --> 17:56.683
The deputy mayor wants
to see you.

17:58.267 --> 18:01.043
This is the main rotunda,
the heart of City Hall.

18:01.148 --> 18:04.810
The  acoustics in this room
are a little bit...quirky.

18:04.858 --> 18:06.252
I need two volunteers.

18:07.748 --> 18:09.652
Okay, you two.
Go over there.

18:10.728 --> 18:11.980
<i>Keep going.</i>

18:14.935 --> 18:16.671
Okay, now whisper
something to each other.

18:16.736 --> 18:18.201
Be very quiet.

18:18.478 --> 18:20.152
This is so boring.

18:20.188 --> 18:21.780
Yeah, I know.

18:21.817 --> 18:23.681
I hope they have
a gift shop.

18:23.716 --> 18:25.862
It's called the whisper spot.
Isn't that cool?

18:26.115 --> 18:27.312
All right, come with me.

18:27.575 --> 18:29.321
Now, I wanna show you
the mailroom.

18:31.986 --> 18:34.013
Ah, I still--smell it.

18:34.056 --> 18:35.780
Well, it's the same air.

18:35.818 --> 18:37.970
Did you think City Hall was
some kind of magical place

18:37.976 --> 18:38.981
<i>like the land of Oz</i>

18:39.028 --> 18:40.240
where nothing bad ever happens?

18:40.307 --> 18:41.411
Yes, yes.
I did.

18:41.455 --> 18:42.583
I did too.

18:42.616 --> 18:43.810
Larry.
Captain Stottlemeyer.

18:44.076 --> 18:46.243
- How are you doing?
- It's the worst week of my life.

18:46.285 --> 18:48.180
Thanks for asking.
I'm 30 years old.

18:48.218 --> 18:49.831
I'm eating antacids like
they're M&M's.

18:49.895 --> 18:51.553
- Is this Monk?
- Yes. Hello.

18:51.585 --> 18:54.051
I didn't quite understand
about the M and Ms.

18:54.085 --> 18:55.553
It was a joke, Mr. Monk.

18:56.006 --> 18:57.221
But, here's a real joke.

18:57.267 --> 18:58.611
20 minutes ago, the union hears

18:58.666 --> 19:00.402
a rumor about you
changing your mind.

19:00.487 --> 19:02.082
Boom, it all hit the fan.

19:02.166 --> 19:03.482
The negotiations are kaput.

19:03.518 --> 19:04.780
The union walked out.

19:04.815 --> 19:06.513
Nobody's talking.
It's over!

19:08.248 --> 19:09.453
Mr. Mayor, I'm so sorry.

19:09.485 --> 19:11.513
There's a man here says
he's a former detective.

19:11.557 --> 19:14.110
He's out there mumbling
something about his wife and car bomb.

19:14.155 --> 19:15.822
Mr. Mayor, I'm sorry--
to interrupt.

19:15.868 --> 19:18.122
I know you're very busy.
My name's Adrian Monk.

19:18.186 --> 19:19.380
W-wait.
Detective Monk?

19:20.317 --> 19:21.900
Come on in.
Dennis, it's fine.

19:21.996 --> 19:24.952
Karen, it's okay.
Mr. Monk is on our team.

19:24.995 --> 19:26.031
I hope.

19:26.455 --> 19:28.452
So, Adrian Monk, we meet at last.

19:28.726 --> 19:29.940
You know, my predecessor,

19:30.008 --> 19:32.383
Mayor Dunaway, said some
really great things about you.

19:32.768 --> 19:34.312
You have an amazing track record.

19:34.337 --> 19:35.923
Well... Go ahead. Please, sit down.

19:36.985 --> 19:38.422
I, uh--I'm okay.

19:38.866 --> 19:41.681
I'm--I'm--I'm fine, sir.

19:41.746 --> 19:43.111
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

19:43.158 --> 19:45.232
You know, my garbage hasn't
been collected either.

19:45.307 --> 19:46.863
We're all in this together,
Mr. Monk.

19:48.318 --> 19:49.952
Did, uh, you talk
to the deputy mayor?

19:49.988 --> 19:51.351
Yes.
Yes, yes, I did.

19:51.415 --> 19:53.010
- He explained the situation.
- Right.

19:53.768 --> 19:55.402
Frankly, we're stuck.

19:55.556 --> 19:57.810
<i>Nobody's talking.
Nobody trusts anybody.</i>

19:57.858 --> 20:00.612
We gotta solve
this Jimmy Cusack case ASAP.

20:00.696 --> 20:02.243
- All right.
- What do you think?

20:02.448 --> 20:04.780
Okay, uh, here's
the thing, Mr. Mayor.

20:04.978 --> 20:07.940
Even if I do find the man
who killed Jimmy Cusack,

20:08.068 --> 20:10.583
even if the strike ends tomorrow,

20:10.618 --> 20:13.912
<i>it's not gonna solve
the big problem.</i>

20:14.467 --> 20:17.343
- What problem is that?
- Your Honor, we have got to...

20:18.037 --> 20:19.640
You've got to face facts.

20:20.116 --> 20:23.882
The city...is ruined forever.
It's a total loss.

20:23.948 --> 20:26.640
Even if we clean up
all the garbage tomorrow,

20:27.325 --> 20:29.222
<i>we'll never get the stink out.</i>

20:29.316 --> 20:30.990
It's like the dining room carpet

20:31.035 --> 20:33.502
when the cat makes
a--a B.M. on there.

20:33.587 --> 20:35.852
I mean, what do you?
You don't have any choice really.

20:35.885 --> 20:37.921
You gotta replace the carpet!
You gotta --

20:38.518 --> 20:39.700
You gotta get rid
of the cat.

20:39.788 --> 20:43.411
<i>And you can never eat in
that dining room again, can you?</i>

20:43.458 --> 20:44.612
No, you can't.

20:44.655 --> 20:46.852
But, I do have a plan.

20:47.286 --> 20:48.410
I have a plan.

20:48.858 --> 20:50.250
Oh, good.

20:50.387 --> 20:51.880
Yes...sir.

20:52.565 --> 20:55.052
It just came to me
last night in a vision.

20:55.766 --> 20:58.141
One, we evacuate the city.

20:58.208 --> 20:59.810
Every man, woman, and child.

20:59.856 --> 21:01.113
- Evacuate--
- Two!

21:01.156 --> 21:02.682
We burn it down

21:02.715 --> 21:04.731
<i>We just burn it.</i>

21:05.117 --> 21:06.350
Scorched earth.

21:07.518 --> 21:09.380
Then, just to be safe,

21:09.418 --> 21:11.062
we collect all the ashes.

21:11.146 --> 21:12.242
And what do we do?

21:12.505 --> 21:14.310
We burn the ashes--Three.

21:14.628 --> 21:17.250
We bring everybody back
and we start over.

21:17.525 --> 21:19.221
Think of it.
Just think of it.

21:19.796 --> 21:21.941
We rebuild San Francisco.

21:22.586 --> 21:23.860
From scratch.

21:26.087 --> 21:28.282
Start fresh.
Everything clean.

21:28.635 --> 21:30.200
Everything brand-new.

21:30.278 --> 21:33.552
Gonna have that new city smell.
Fresh off the lot.

21:33.636 --> 21:36.230
We can even straighten out
Lombard Street while we're at it.

21:38.616 --> 21:40.000
- Maybe.
- Yeah! Yeah!

21:40.045 --> 21:41.812
But, sir, if you don't
write it down,

21:41.855 --> 21:43.773
you'll--you'll forget it.

21:46.326 --> 21:48.090
Oh, I don't think
I'm gonna forget this.

21:48.158 --> 21:49.901
- So--you'll think about it.
- Oh, yes!

21:50.067 --> 21:51.301
Yes, absolutely.

21:51.367 --> 21:52.523
I promise.

21:52.716 --> 21:54.180
Yeah, but, Mr. Monk.

21:54.215 --> 21:56.073
I'm gonna need you
to promise me something.

21:56.116 --> 21:57.283
Anything.

21:57.526 --> 21:59.872
I want you to promise that
you're gonna get some sleep

21:59.888 --> 22:01.801
before you start working
on this murder case.

22:06.556 --> 22:07.710
Are you okay?

22:12.987 --> 22:14.182
Scuff marks...

22:15.005 --> 22:16.302
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah!</i>

22:16.346 --> 22:18.043
New shoes.
Yeah, no big deal.

22:19.117 --> 22:20.401
You like cashews?

22:20.735 --> 22:22.651
Oh, yeah, my wife says
I like 'em too much.

22:22.686 --> 22:24.021
Here, help yourself.

22:24.127 --> 22:25.623
No, no, thanks.

22:26.717 --> 22:29.170
I'm gonna go--back
to Jimmy Cusack's office

22:29.218 --> 22:30.510
and have a look around.

22:30.555 --> 22:31.882
Oh. Yeah.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.213
Ever been there?

22:33.257 --> 22:34.610
Jimmy Cusack's office?

22:34.656 --> 22:36.210
No, never have.

22:36.845 --> 22:38.880
Well, you let me know
if you find something, now.

22:38.915 --> 22:40.313
- Keep me in the loop.
- Funny--

22:40.357 --> 22:41.430
I was talking to somebody.

22:41.476 --> 22:43.782
They said they thought
they saw you there

22:44.008 --> 22:45.220
the night he died.

22:46.338 --> 22:47.650
Well, they're mistaken.

22:48.237 --> 22:50.141
What would I be doing
in Jimmy Cusack's office?

22:50.168 --> 22:51.911
He hated my guts.
Everybody knew that.

22:52.087 --> 22:53.291
Right.

22:53.376 --> 22:56.500
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
make some calls right now.

22:56.585 --> 22:58.350
So, good luck to you, Mr. Monk.

22:58.387 --> 22:59.341
Yeah.

22:59.365 --> 23:02.280
Anything you need,
be sure and let me know, okay?

23:02.808 --> 23:04.052
Right.

23:13.226 --> 23:15.392
There he is!
What took you so long?

23:15.455 --> 23:18.661
I...was upstairs
talking to the mayor.

23:18.767 --> 23:20.042
You were in his office?

23:20.087 --> 23:22.181
I just broke the Cusack case
wide open.

23:22.205 --> 23:23.662
- You have a suspect.
- Oh, yeah.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.171
I have a suspect.

23:25.235 --> 23:26.862
- Well, who is it?
- Okay--

23:26.937 --> 23:29.181
But, you can't tell anybody.
This is big.

23:29.225 --> 23:31.701
This is going to rip the city apart.

23:33.876 --> 23:35.070
Reporters.

23:36.128 --> 23:37.312
Over here.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.692
Okay--
Hang on, hang on.

23:43.337 --> 23:45.403
Just a little bit further.
Just to make sure.

23:50.036 --> 23:51.151
What is it?

23:51.197 --> 23:53.932
Okay, but you have to promise me
that you won't tell anyone

23:54.015 --> 23:56.370
until I am 100% sure!

23:56.466 --> 23:57.571
Absolutely.
What--

23:57.615 --> 24:00.521
<i>'Cause if I am right,
this is gonna be the biggest</i>

24:00.546 --> 24:02.230
<i>story of the year!</i>

24:02.655 --> 24:05.521
<i>The mayor was in
Jimmy Cusack's office</i>

24:05.646 --> 24:07.012
the night he was killed.

24:10.646 --> 24:12.672
Are you saying the mayor is--

24:13.795 --> 24:15.341
Mayor Nickelson's the guy?

24:15.426 --> 24:17.250
<i>I am saying he was involved.</i>

24:17.288 --> 24:19.512
<i>He is definitely hiding
something.</i>

24:19.558 --> 24:21.450
Wow.
I mean, wow.

24:21.487 --> 24:23.053
What do we do?

24:23.087 --> 24:24.483
I don't know.
But, Monk is right.

24:24.516 --> 24:25.782
We have to be very careful.

24:25.816 --> 24:27.231
Nobody says a word.
Not a--

24:28.276 --> 24:29.683
Oh, hell.

24:34.616 --> 24:36.013
Enough is enough!

24:36.055 --> 24:37.440
Enough is enough!
Enough is enough!

24:37.488 --> 24:38.953
Mayor Nickelson!

24:38.988 --> 24:40.781
You cannot hide in there
forever.

24:42.098 --> 24:43.202
We know what you did!

24:43.238 --> 24:44.651
You have blood on your hands!

24:45.707 --> 24:46.800
<i>What do we want?</i>

24:46.846 --> 24:48.122
<i>Justice for Jimmy!</i>

24:48.188 --> 24:50.070
- <i>What do we want?</i>
- <i>Justice for Jimmy!</i>

24:50.256 --> 24:51.150
What do we want?

24:51.187 --> 24:52.183
Justice for Jimmy!

24:52.215 --> 24:53.550
Enough is enough!

24:53.587 --> 24:55.550
Enough is enough!

25:01.425 --> 25:02.911
Ah, I've done it again.

25:03.328 --> 25:05.211
Made the situation worse.

25:10.816 --> 25:13.171
The union wants the mayor
indicted for murder.

25:13.255 --> 25:15.280
The mayor's
denying everything.

25:16.716 --> 25:19.790
And I haven't slept
in nine days.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.752
<i>It keeps piling up.</i>

25:32.855 --> 25:34.552
I always hated garbage.

25:35.256 --> 25:36.810
Even when I was a kid.

25:38.317 --> 25:42.212
We lived 2.2 miles
from the city dump.

25:43.386 --> 25:45.780
I used to lie in bed.
Smelling it.

25:46.645 --> 25:48.351
Had nightmares all the time.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.852
About trash bags.

25:52.936 --> 25:58.131
Piling up outside.
Higher and higher...

25:59.525 --> 26:02.141
Until we couldn't leave
the house.

26:03.598 --> 26:05.183
We were buried alive.

26:12.997 --> 26:15.241
And now, it's coming true.

26:20.488 --> 26:21.623
Dr. Kroger?

26:26.268 --> 26:29.060
Adrian, have you been
sending me your trash?

26:46.666 --> 26:47.711
No.

26:50.968 --> 26:52.011
See...

26:52.725 --> 26:56.912
<i>I've been getting boxes of trash</i>

26:57.265 --> 26:59.681
sent to me in the mail.

27:01.687 --> 27:03.572
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

27:04.337 --> 27:06.653
Now, Adrian, don't deny it.

27:07.557 --> 27:12.121
<i>It's all sorted according to
color and food groups.</i>

27:12.998 --> 27:15.883
It's your handwriting
on the label.

27:16.778 --> 27:18.571
<i>It's upsetting my wife.</i>

27:18.677 --> 27:20.923
<i>It's upsetting my children.</i>

27:21.038 --> 27:23.081
And I want it to stop.

27:29.538 --> 27:32.451
Adrian, do you hear me?
I want it to stop!

27:33.617 --> 27:35.191
I want it to stop too.

27:43.207 --> 27:44.773
Mr. Monk, maybe we missed him.

27:44.878 --> 27:47.091
No, he always uses
this door to avoid the press.

27:47.257 --> 27:48.610
He'll be out soon.

27:48.658 --> 27:50.080
He has to go home sometime.

27:50.115 --> 27:51.482
Yeah, so do I.

27:52.887 --> 27:53.982
It looks like rain!

27:54.016 --> 27:55.981
That'll help, right?
It'll wash away the stench.

27:56.047 --> 27:56.951
Yeah...

27:56.985 --> 27:59.090
Contaminate
the city's water supply.

27:59.136 --> 28:01.053
Probably kill
half a million people.

28:01.605 --> 28:03.003
Yeah, that's the spirit.

28:03.787 --> 28:05.482
Your Honor!
Mr. Mayor!

28:05.515 --> 28:07.112
That's the guy.
Get him outta here!

28:07.157 --> 28:08.631
Sir, this will only
take a minute.

28:08.676 --> 28:09.821
You know, let him through.

28:09.886 --> 28:11.811
Let him through.
I wanna talk to this guy.

28:12.017 --> 28:15.703
Mr. Monk, do you have idea
what you've done to me?

28:16.395 --> 28:18.543
I've been accused of a lot of things.
Matter of fact,

28:18.605 --> 28:20.551
I've been accused
of just about everything.

28:21.578 --> 28:22.550
But, this?

28:23.497 --> 28:25.543
We asked you to look
into a man's death.

28:25.616 --> 28:28.032
We never expected you to accuse
the mayor of homicide!

28:28.095 --> 28:29.371
No, no,
you have to understand.

28:29.415 --> 28:30.682
He's having a really tough week.

28:30.995 --> 28:32.042
Tougher than this?

28:32.108 --> 28:33.262
<i>Here's the thing.</i>

28:33.586 --> 28:35.672
It might be months before
there's an indictment.

28:35.717 --> 28:38.133
<i>Then, there's the trial,
which could take forever.</i>

28:38.237 --> 28:40.803
The union won't go back to work
until there is a verdict.

28:40.867 --> 28:42.051
What do you want me to do?

28:42.095 --> 28:45.093
Well, if it isn't
too inconvenient...

28:45.507 --> 28:48.312
I was thinking,
maybe, you could--confess

28:48.377 --> 28:50.041
and then resign temporarily...

28:50.728 --> 28:51.832
<i>Okay...sir!</i>

28:51.917 --> 28:54.542
Sir, you were in Jimmy Cusack's
office that night.

28:54.827 --> 28:56.452
W-why are you lying about that?

28:56.486 --> 28:57.700
Sir, don't answer that.

28:57.788 --> 29:00.182
The mayor was at home
Monday night with his wife

29:00.326 --> 29:01.871
all night from 8:00 on.

29:01.977 --> 29:03.263
You have any other questions,

29:03.366 --> 29:05.341
submit them to
the District Attorney's office.

29:05.426 --> 29:06.982
- Okay, let's go, sir.
- Where was it?

29:07.047 --> 29:08.972
It was in a drugstore
downtown on Minton Street.

29:09.087 --> 29:10.091
Somebody turned it in.

29:10.156 --> 29:12.413
A drugstore?
I was never in any drugstore.

29:12.517 --> 29:13.931
Here, take this.

29:20.227 --> 29:21.401
Natalie.

29:22.116 --> 29:24.103
Was it raining Monday night?

29:24.817 --> 29:26.841
I think so, Mr. Monk.
Why?

29:28.418 --> 29:29.773
<i>Oh, you mean
the plaid umbrella?</i>

29:29.795 --> 29:31.820
Yeah, I found it,
Tuesday morning.

29:31.875 --> 29:33.953
I was punching out.
It was right over here.

29:34.496 --> 29:38.041
It said "Property of City Hall,"
so...I dropped it off.

29:38.738 --> 29:39.901
Is there a reward?

29:40.085 --> 29:42.182
Yeah. You did the right thing.
That's your reward.

29:42.218 --> 29:44.522
Jimmy Cusack was killed
right around midnight,

29:44.566 --> 29:45.693
just up the street.

29:45.798 --> 29:48.073
Do you have any more
of these Odor Eaters?

29:49.528 --> 29:50.713
How many do you need?

29:50.935 --> 29:52.251
Oh, about...

29:52.647 --> 29:53.573
trillion...

29:53.986 --> 29:55.912
Mr. Decko, back to the umbrella,

29:56.006 --> 29:57.232
did you notice who left it?

29:58.305 --> 29:59.090
No.

29:59.136 --> 30:01.852
Do you happen to have
the sales receipts from that night?

30:02.127 --> 30:03.211
Maybe.

30:04.018 --> 30:05.391
Is there a reward?

30:09.708 --> 30:11.232
Here's one from 1:00 AM, sir.

30:11.505 --> 30:13.401
You wanna tell me
what this is all about?

30:13.665 --> 30:14.630
No.

30:14.666 --> 30:15.990
Okay. Fair enough.

30:18.068 --> 30:19.232
Here it is.

30:20.358 --> 30:21.542
<i>Here it is.</i>

30:22.935 --> 30:25.320
12:24 AM.
He paid cash.

30:25.468 --> 30:26.640
Bottled water.

30:26.907 --> 30:29.270
A pack of Belgium Gold
cigarettes.

30:30.158 --> 30:31.151
And...

30:32.888 --> 30:34.971
- A wrist bandage.
- Of course!

30:35.696 --> 30:36.850
Here's what happened..

30:37.658 --> 30:40.200
<i>The mayor snuck into
Jimmy Cusack's office</i>

30:40.437 --> 30:41.602
<i>shot him in the head.</i>

30:41.636 --> 30:43.241
<i>He made it look like
a suicide.</i>

30:43.346 --> 30:45.761
<i>Then, he realized
that he had just made</i>

30:45.807 --> 30:48.030
<i>the biggest mistake
of his life.</i>

30:48.066 --> 30:50.930
<i>Because Jimmy Cusack
was left-handed.</i>

30:50.965 --> 30:52.922
<i>Nobody would ever believe
he would shoot himself</i>

30:52.988 --> 30:54.283
<i>with this right hand.</i>

30:55.087 --> 30:56.622
<i>But, Jimmy Cusack
was already dead.</i>

30:56.678 --> 30:57.863
<i>What could the Mayor do?</i>

30:57.926 --> 30:59.663
<i>Put a bandage
on the other wrist.</i>

30:59.726 --> 31:01.290
<i>Exactly!</i>

31:02.935 --> 31:06.972
<i>He walked two blocks, came in
here, bought the wrist bandage,</i>

31:07.237 --> 31:10.063
<i>then he went back
to Jimmy Cusack's office</i>

31:10.365 --> 31:12.202
<i>and made it look
like Jimmy Cusack</i>

31:12.345 --> 31:14.051
<i>had a sprained left hand.</i>

31:15.235 --> 31:17.441
<i>And it would have worked too,
except...</i>

31:17.645 --> 31:19.023
<i>He forgot his umbrella.</i>

31:19.305 --> 31:21.313
Well, it should be
easy enough to prove.

31:21.356 --> 31:22.833
He's the mayor,
for God's sake.

31:23.977 --> 31:25.101
Who rang this up?

31:25.408 --> 31:26.561
Let's see.

31:26.606 --> 31:27.870
It says...

31:28.567 --> 31:30.111
Cashier number one.

31:31.028 --> 31:32.101
Oh, that would be me.

31:32.718 --> 31:34.632
Well, do you remember
who you sold that to?

31:34.698 --> 31:35.672
Maybe I do.

31:35.715 --> 31:37.230
- There's no reward.
- I have no idea.

31:37.275 --> 31:38.822
There's so many people
that come here.

31:38.868 --> 31:40.890
It could have been anybody.
We get all kinds in here.

31:40.977 --> 31:42.013
Was it him?

31:44.078 --> 31:45.193
The mayor?

31:45.737 --> 31:47.623
What would the mayor
be doing in my store

31:47.686 --> 31:48.830
at 12:30 in the morning?

31:48.885 --> 31:50.900
Buying a wrist bandage!

31:50.938 --> 31:52.490
No. I-it wasn't him.

31:53.635 --> 31:54.790
It was him.

31:55.567 --> 31:57.142
<i>It wasn't him.</i>

31:58.506 --> 31:59.783
It was him!

32:00.285 --> 32:01.962
- No, it wasn't him.
- It was him.

32:02.026 --> 32:04.291
Look, I'm not an idiot.
I think I would notice

32:04.356 --> 32:06.780
if the mayor of San Francisco
was in my store

32:06.886 --> 32:08.440
at 12:30 in the morning!

32:09.127 --> 32:10.921
It wasn't...him.

32:17.825 --> 32:19.010
So, you were wrong?

32:19.518 --> 32:22.080
'Cause usually when you say,
"Here's what happened"...

32:23.445 --> 32:24.933
it's pretty much what happened.

32:24.968 --> 32:27.271
Yeah, but it's the stench.
It's everywhere.

32:27.296 --> 32:28.831
I-I-I can't possibly--

32:28.865 --> 32:30.303
It wasn't the mayor, Monk!

32:32.867 --> 32:34.532
I'm gonna have to go
out to the press

32:34.575 --> 32:36.093
and retract everything!

32:37.238 --> 32:39.740
So?
What's the big deal?

32:40.637 --> 32:42.742
Oh, like he's never
been wrong before?

32:43.258 --> 32:44.251
No.

32:45.037 --> 32:46.273
No, he hasn't.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.150
Thank God you're here.
He's having some sort of breakdown.

33:07.177 --> 33:09.403
- He won't even talk to me.
- <i>What the hell's he doing?</i>

33:09.445 --> 33:11.570
He's cleaning up San Francisco
single-handedly.

33:11.635 --> 33:13.622
Hey, Captain!
Lieutenant!

33:13.785 --> 33:15.063
Where did he get the truck?

33:15.107 --> 33:17.112
He told the dispatcher
it was a police emergency.

33:17.155 --> 33:18.490
He's like a vigilante.

33:18.966 --> 33:20.602
A garbage vigilante.

33:20.998 --> 33:22.731
You could say that,
but don't.

33:23.585 --> 33:24.571
Hey, Monk!

33:26.196 --> 33:27.243
How ya doing?

33:27.465 --> 33:29.153
So far so fabulous!

33:29.446 --> 33:31.981
I've done seven...
eight...nine houses.

33:32.025 --> 33:33.280
<i>Well, good for you.</i>

33:33.328 --> 33:34.660
<i>That looks great.</i>

33:34.907 --> 33:37.091
You intend to clean up
the entire city up by yourself?

33:37.138 --> 33:38.193
Well...

33:38.475 --> 33:40.023
that's the plan, Stan.

33:40.066 --> 33:41.180
Street by street.

33:41.246 --> 33:42.683
One bag at a time.

33:42.805 --> 33:45.123
One...bag...at a time.

33:45.186 --> 33:46.673
One bag at a time.

33:46.818 --> 33:48.520
Where you gonna put
the garbage?

33:48.708 --> 33:50.183
I got it all figured.

33:50.306 --> 33:53.372
When this truck's full,
gonna drive it into the bay.

33:53.798 --> 33:56.021
Then come back,
get another truck.

33:56.048 --> 33:57.590
Keep driving 'em into the bay.

33:57.616 --> 34:00.572
One bag at a time.
One truck at a time.

34:00.678 --> 34:01.990
One bag at a time.

34:02.405 --> 34:03.470
One truck at time.

34:03.547 --> 34:05.703
Well, so long as you got a plan.

34:05.748 --> 34:06.690
Yeah!

34:06.777 --> 34:08.949
But, Mr. Monk, the case,
remember? Jimmy Cusack.

34:11.677 --> 34:13.522
I forgot to tell you.

34:13.625 --> 34:15.692
I solved that case
about an hour ago.

34:16.846 --> 34:19.400
W-wait.
You solved the case?

34:19.446 --> 34:21.512
Take a look, take a look,
take a little look.

34:21.945 --> 34:24.371
This was stapled
to a telephone pole

34:24.476 --> 34:26.382
that was right in front of us
the whole time.

34:26.705 --> 34:28.163
He's the guy!

34:28.327 --> 34:29.893
Who's the guy?
Alice Cooper?

34:30.784 --> 34:33.580
Are you telling us that
Alice Cooper, the rock star,

34:33.628 --> 34:34.942
killed Jimmy Cusack?

34:35.108 --> 34:36.360
First off,

34:36.466 --> 34:39.422
I don't think Alice Cooper
is his real name.

34:40.094 --> 34:41.340
Take a closer look.

34:41.844 --> 34:44.601
He is sitting in
an antique wingback chair.

34:44.648 --> 34:46.841
The same kind of chair
Jimmy Cusack was sitting in

34:46.875 --> 34:48.373
when he was killed.

34:49.148 --> 34:50.501
Check this out.

34:50.565 --> 34:52.112
- What?
- Check out the date.

34:52.746 --> 34:54.382
April 5th.
Monday night.

34:55.138 --> 34:58.553
Same night as the murder.
Coincidence?

34:59.718 --> 35:01.091
Yeah, coincidence.

35:02.196 --> 35:03.302
No.

35:03.348 --> 35:06.851
No, we were--we were looking
at this case all wrong.

35:06.978 --> 35:08.741
'Cause it never was
about Cusack.

35:08.828 --> 35:11.001
It was never
about the garbage strike.

35:11.045 --> 35:14.073
And it was never
about the Sanitation Union.

35:14.107 --> 35:15.472
It was about the chair.

35:15.507 --> 35:17.040
The antique chair.

35:17.145 --> 35:20.273
The antique wingback
Cusack chair!

35:20.578 --> 35:21.873
Here's what happened...

35:22.155 --> 35:25.943
<i>It is no secret that rock and
roll stars collect antiques.</i>

35:25.977 --> 35:27.933
<i>Especially antique chairs.</i>

35:27.975 --> 35:29.723
<i>What the hell are you
talking about?</i>

35:29.746 --> 35:31.541
<i>Alice Cooper must have read</i>

35:31.587 --> 35:34.660
<i>about Jimmy Cusack's
handcrafted wingback chair.</i>

35:34.725 --> 35:37.040
<i>He was consumed with envy!</i>

35:37.167 --> 35:40.020
<i>He was consumed
with resentment!</i>

35:40.386 --> 35:42.680
<i>Alice had to possess</i>

35:42.726 --> 35:46.400
<i>the fairest antique
wingbackchair in all the land.</i>

35:50.308 --> 35:51.770
Should I be writing
this down?

35:52.488 --> 35:53.542
Nope.

35:53.795 --> 35:54.881
<i>It's true.</i>

35:54.927 --> 35:56.120
<i>Alice Cooper is a hippie.</i>

35:56.187 --> 35:57.483
<i>But he's the bad
kind of hippie.</i>

35:57.546 --> 36:00.732
<i>He's the kind of hippie that
breaks into people's offices</i>

36:00.745 --> 36:02.110
<i>and beats them up</i>

36:02.175 --> 36:03.741
<i>and shoots them in the head.</i>

36:03.776 --> 36:04.800
<i>Why?</i>

36:04.847 --> 36:06.612
<i>To steal their antique chairs.</i>

36:07.746 --> 36:09.100
Why didn't he take the chair?

36:09.147 --> 36:10.102
<i>Hello!</i>

36:10.147 --> 36:11.260
It had a bullet hole in it.

36:11.287 --> 36:13.381
It had blood on it.
He didn't want it anymore.

36:13.428 --> 36:15.200
- He could have washed it.
- Randy.

36:15.737 --> 36:17.783
I don't think we need
to stand here and pick apart

36:17.825 --> 36:20.080
the-Alice-Cooper-wants
an-antique-chair theory.

36:20.248 --> 36:21.630
If you will excuse me,

36:21.756 --> 36:22.972
I have a city to clean.

36:23.015 --> 36:24.411
One bag at a time!

36:25.335 --> 36:26.973
One bag at a time.

36:27.008 --> 36:28.541
One bag at a time.

36:28.866 --> 36:30.711
One bag at a time.

36:32.168 --> 36:33.140
I got it!

36:33.178 --> 36:34.333
I got it.
Hold on.

36:34.358 --> 36:35.730
It's all up to me!
I got it!

36:35.788 --> 36:37.382
It's all up...to me!

36:37.666 --> 36:40.070
It's all up to me!
Oh, God!

36:40.106 --> 36:41.442
<i>One bag at a time!</i>

36:41.475 --> 36:43.441
It might be time to call
Dr. Kroger.

36:44.955 --> 36:47.061
I got an idea.
Stinkin' trash!

36:47.317 --> 36:48.761
Hey, help me get him to the car.

36:55.957 --> 36:56.981
You can sit over there.

36:57.066 --> 36:58.183
Don't touch anything.

36:58.267 --> 37:00.861
Thanks, Barry.
Thank the old man too.

37:09.997 --> 37:11.511
Feeling better?

37:12.538 --> 37:13.680
Where are we?

37:14.275 --> 37:15.903
It's called
a fabrication room.

37:16.208 --> 37:18.851
This is where they assemble
their new circuit boards.

37:19.597 --> 37:21.381
I know the guy in charge
of their security.

37:21.446 --> 37:22.622
He owed me a favor.

37:25.095 --> 37:27.221
I can't smell anything.

37:29.046 --> 37:30.322
That's right.

37:30.407 --> 37:32.543
They have
their own oxygen supply.

37:33.096 --> 37:36.081
It is 100% germ free.

37:38.276 --> 37:40.330
Germ...free?

37:43.257 --> 37:45.221
Adrian Monk,
you are sitting in

37:45.285 --> 37:47.851
the cleanest room
in the world.

37:49.805 --> 37:51.422
It's quiet too.

37:55.096 --> 37:56.170
Yeah.

37:57.585 --> 38:00.071
Well. We haven't got all day.

38:00.118 --> 38:01.583
They're kicking us out at 2:00.

38:01.687 --> 38:05.403
So, why don't we just kick back
and enjoy ourselves.

38:14.408 --> 38:16.590
I can feel my head.

38:17.486 --> 38:19.052
Clearing up.

38:20.265 --> 38:21.521
That's good.

38:26.927 --> 38:28.770
It wasn't Alice Cooper.

38:29.466 --> 38:30.500
I know.

38:31.527 --> 38:32.843
Leland.

38:33.648 --> 38:34.940
<i>I got it.</i>

38:35.016 --> 38:37.892
I just...got it.

38:39.046 --> 38:41.602
<i>Remember that receipt
from the drugstore?</i>

38:41.667 --> 38:44.252
The guy that bought
that wrist bandage

38:44.468 --> 38:46.952
also bought some cigarettes.

38:47.335 --> 38:49.751
That's right.
Belgium Gold.

38:50.247 --> 38:52.002
<i>The union accountant,
Ron Nealy,</i>

38:52.047 --> 38:53.761
<i>was smoking
imported cigarettes.</i>

38:53.825 --> 38:55.773
<i>The box said Belgium Gold!</i>

38:55.835 --> 38:56.863
<i>The accountant.</i>

38:56.928 --> 38:59.750
<i>Now, you're making sense.
He ran the pension fund.</i>

38:59.797 --> 39:01.661
<i>He could have been skimming
money for years.</i>

39:01.705 --> 39:04.141
And he was about to get caught.

39:04.495 --> 39:06.243
He knew they'd be going over
the books

39:06.267 --> 39:07.803
as part of the negotiation.

39:07.986 --> 39:09.503
Here's what happened...

39:09.726 --> 39:10.902
I mean--

39:11.065 --> 39:13.070
<i>Here's what really happened...</i>

39:14.375 --> 39:18.130
<i>Nealy killed Cusack and
made it look like a suicide.</i>

39:18.415 --> 39:19.853
<i>But he screwed up.</i>

39:20.096 --> 39:22.473
<i>Then he had to run out
and buy a wrist bandage.</i>

39:23.227 --> 39:24.561
<i>That makes sense.</i>

39:25.975 --> 39:27.101
<i>But wait.</i>

39:27.676 --> 39:29.120
<i>He grabbed
the mayor's umbrella.</i>

39:29.227 --> 39:30.690
- <i>Yes, he did.</i>
- <i>How did he get it?</i>

39:31.058 --> 39:33.223
<i>The mayor left it there.</i>

39:33.646 --> 39:37.253
<i>The mayor was in Cusack's office</i>
<i>earlier that night.</i>

39:37.305 --> 39:40.141
<i>They were meeting secretly
trying to settle the strike.</i>

39:40.208 --> 39:43.541
<i>Officially, the two sides were
not supposed to be talking.</i>

39:43.577 --> 39:47.140
<i>That's why the mayor could
never admit he was there.</i>

39:47.408 --> 39:49.450
<i>It would have been
political suicide.</i>

39:52.608 --> 39:53.703
Monk.

39:55.108 --> 39:57.643
I have been burned twice
this week already.

39:57.678 --> 39:59.100
Are you sure about this?

39:59.146 --> 40:01.402
I mean, are you
absolutely sure?

40:06.046 --> 40:07.742
That's good enough for me.

40:17.147 --> 40:18.633
The captain looks so happy.

40:18.677 --> 40:20.501
Everybody's happy.
It's a great day.

40:20.587 --> 40:21.762
Listen.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.921
Here! Here they come!
This is it!

40:24.186 --> 40:25.793
Here it comes.
Get ready.

40:26.116 --> 40:27.530
Gentlemen!

40:27.826 --> 40:29.360
Hey, boys!

40:29.466 --> 40:30.843
Welcome back!

40:31.455 --> 40:33.741
You're a sight for sore eyes!

40:37.487 --> 40:38.903
It's a great day!

40:38.948 --> 40:41.101
You're a sight for sore eyes,
gentlemen!

40:42.635 --> 40:43.841
<i>We missed you!</i>

40:43.878 --> 40:45.691
Mr. Monk, our hero.

40:45.757 --> 40:47.171
Oh, no, you're the hero!

40:47.208 --> 40:48.602
No, you're the hero.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.202
No, you're the her--
We're all heroes!

40:50.288 --> 40:51.662
Except for Natalie.

40:52.106 --> 40:54.643
One bag at a time, gentlemen,
that's the way we do it.

40:54.677 --> 40:56.202
Don't forget the bag of water.

40:56.246 --> 40:58.733
<i>Thank you, Morris.
Thank you, guys.</i>

40:58.796 --> 41:00.471
No, we should be
thanking you.

41:00.535 --> 41:01.733
You saved our pension fund.

41:01.776 --> 41:04.272
And you got us
a brand-new contract.

41:04.378 --> 41:06.440
Anything you want, Mr. Monk,
you let us know.

41:07.008 --> 41:08.100
All right.

41:08.147 --> 41:09.741
<i>You guys do great work.</i>

41:10.317 --> 41:11.473
<i>Great work.</i>

41:12.816 --> 41:14.043
<i>Wait, wait, hold it.</i>

41:14.077 --> 41:15.272
<i>Excuse me, gentlemen.</i>

41:15.895 --> 41:17.981
What about this,
the confetti?

41:19.245 --> 41:21.070
<i>You just can't...
leave that there.</i>

41:21.107 --> 41:22.272
<i>Right?</i>

41:22.305 --> 41:24.591
<i>I mean, uh,
you can't leave that.</i>

41:25.166 --> 41:26.272
<i>Thank you.</i>

41:26.308 --> 41:29.202
I wouldn't have thrown it if I thought
it was gonna stay in the street.

41:29.808 --> 41:32.282
How 'bout, uh,
probably start back around--

41:32.327 --> 41:34.181
There's a little bit
around the corner there.

41:34.217 --> 41:35.552
Yeah, this is good,
right here.

41:35.617 --> 41:39.323
And then you might want to make sure
you get under the-- under the paper.

41:39.757 --> 41:41.171
That's it--whoa, no!

41:41.207 --> 41:42.843
Natalie, Natalie.
Don't--don't--

41:42.878 --> 41:45.030
Don't you do that.
Let them do that.

41:45.096 --> 41:46.400
- It's their job.
- Sorry.

41:46.446 --> 41:47.473
It's their job.

41:47.538 --> 41:49.443
You work for me, remember,
not for them.
