01:31.999 --> 01:34.028
This head wound didn't
happen from a fall.

01:34.139 --> 01:37.700
Multiple contusions says
repeated blunt force to the head.

01:38.692 --> 01:40.884
Also, bruising on the neck.

01:41.015 --> 01:43.664
I noticed a name tag,
Alexx. Who is that ?

01:46.193 --> 01:47.168
Patrick Hale.

01:47.669 --> 01:49.827
It's got an old picture of him on it.

01:49.878 --> 01:51.012
Cute kid.

01:51.013 --> 01:54.438
And we got about a hundred people
trying to see what he looks like now.

01:54.952 --> 01:57.456
High school reunion's
going on all weekend.

01:57.607 --> 01:59.711
Wavecrest High, Class of 1990.

01:59.712 --> 02:01.265
Champagne bottle.

02:01.266 --> 02:04.193
We've got a probable murder
weapon here that someone

02:04.314 --> 02:06.700
took no great pains to hide.

02:06.821 --> 02:09.544
Killer was either in a hurry,
or eager to get caught.

02:09.746 --> 02:11.657
Assuming it's the former.

02:13.239 --> 02:16.009
Hmmm... What do we have here ?

02:16.541 --> 02:19.064
Smeared blood, Alexx.

02:19.239 --> 02:21.736
That can't do that by itself, can it ?

02:22.557 --> 02:23.478
Horatio...

02:24.413 --> 02:27.368
name tag says our boy was prom king,

02:27.539 --> 02:31.704
student body president, and
quarterback of the football team.

02:31.825 --> 02:33.462
Every high school has one.

02:33.755 --> 02:36.052
People either want to
be him, or be with him.

02:36.243 --> 02:40.329
Tell you what, all kinds of rage
behind these head wounds.

02:40.330 --> 02:43.430
Take motive to murder,
multiply it by 15 years...

02:43.431 --> 02:48.001
And we have a victim that started
the weekend big man on campus...

02:48.142 --> 02:49.114
and ended it

02:49.342 --> 02:50.714
dead on arrival.

03:45.816 --> 03:47.684
So far, no one saw a thing.

03:47.685 --> 03:50.504
I guess this is the one time our
quarterback didn't have an audience.

03:51.170 --> 03:52.159
Excuse me, Frank.

03:52.654 --> 03:53.596
Horatio Caine.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.050
Yeah, I know where that is.
Just stay there.

03:57.201 --> 03:58.148
Yeah.

03:58.741 --> 04:01.048
Uh, Frank, could you...

04:01.382 --> 04:03.156
could you take over here ?

04:03.295 --> 04:04.500
Yeah, you got trouble ?

04:04.701 --> 04:06.053
I don't know yet.

04:19.536 --> 04:21.439
Victim's got two gunshot wounds.

04:21.821 --> 04:23.927
Looks like both were
through-and-through.

04:24.405 --> 04:25.821
Turn him over.

04:51.159 --> 04:52.278
Lieutenant...

04:53.001 --> 04:54.117
you know this guy ?

04:56.175 --> 04:57.663
You figured it out.

04:59.306 --> 05:01.490
Is Raymond still alive, Bob ?

05:01.830 --> 05:05.311
- Look, man,I'm deep undercover.
- I didn't see you,

05:05.582 --> 05:07.828
and you didn't see me, okay ?

05:11.677 --> 05:14.106
Weird, Lieutenant. No casings.

05:26.679 --> 05:28.416
There aren't going to be any casings.

05:30.814 --> 05:32.095
Where do you want me to start ?

05:34.887 --> 05:36.912
It won't be necessary to start, Eric.

05:36.913 --> 05:37.917
Why not ?

05:37.918 --> 05:40.809
Someone has processed
this crime scene.

05:41.218 --> 05:42.102
Who ?

05:42.424 --> 05:44.119
Someone thorough.

05:54.699 --> 05:56.863
No prints, no ballistics...

05:57.598 --> 05:58.952
Think the killer did this ?

05:59.073 --> 06:02.487
Killers clean scenes, Eric.
They don't process them.

06:04.243 --> 06:06.033
Let's get Bob to post.

06:06.234 --> 06:07.255
All right.

06:07.256 --> 06:09.702
Let me check here and see if
these guys missed anything.

06:13.630 --> 06:15.040
Is that the wife ?

06:15.041 --> 06:16.089
Yeah...

06:17.337 --> 06:18.493
Jennie Hale.

06:18.494 --> 06:20.510
Former head cheerleader, prom queen.

06:20.511 --> 06:23.517
Quarterback and head cheerleader,
still together after all these years.

06:23.638 --> 06:26.382
Nice to know there are some
things you can still count on.

06:26.747 --> 06:28.470
Just hang in there, Jen.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.610
Hey, guys... take him out back.

06:30.611 --> 06:31.623
Wait.

06:31.624 --> 06:33.230
Ma'am, this might not be the best place...

06:33.231 --> 06:35.337
No, I have to see him.

06:35.554 --> 06:36.612
Please.

06:43.609 --> 06:45.418
Oh. Patrick...

06:49.949 --> 06:51.382
What's that ?

06:52.512 --> 06:53.763
On his neck.

06:56.022 --> 06:57.255
Is that a hickey ?

06:57.770 --> 07:01.745
Uh... or it could be a rupture
of the blood vessels in the...

07:01.866 --> 07:03.570
subcutaneous tissue.

07:03.691 --> 07:04.676
A hickey.

07:06.992 --> 07:10.469
15 years of marriage, and it's
like no time's passed at all.

07:11.580 --> 07:13.381
He's still playing around.

07:18.533 --> 07:20.080
Poor thing.

07:21.908 --> 07:26.352
Officers, if you need any help,
please don't hesitate. Krystal Sneed.

07:26.493 --> 07:28.089
I organized the event.

07:28.210 --> 07:29.618
I know everybody here.

07:29.619 --> 07:32.421
Any idea who might've
given Patrick the love bite ?

07:32.422 --> 07:35.360
Um... just between us ?

07:35.361 --> 07:39.378
Patrick used to always make
time with the undesirables.

07:39.539 --> 07:41.898
He cheated on Jennie
three times senior year.

07:42.019 --> 07:43.846
Any of those ladies here today ?

07:43.949 --> 07:45.101
Michelle Day.

07:45.102 --> 07:47.146
Wouldn't exactly call her a lady.

07:47.372 --> 07:50.165
I used to... act out.

07:51.432 --> 07:52.933
Patrick was popular.

07:52.934 --> 07:56.656
He'd ditch his girlfriend after
games and we'd go down to the pier.

07:56.820 --> 07:58.428
Well, under it.

07:59.414 --> 08:01.719
Did you and Patrick
reunite for old times' sake ?

08:01.720 --> 08:02.865
No.

08:03.916 --> 08:07.172
Michelle, Patrick
incurred a suction bruise

08:07.173 --> 08:09.129
on his neck antemortem.

08:09.330 --> 08:10.652
What's that mean ?

08:10.653 --> 08:13.651
It means whoever gave him the
hickey did so before his murder.

08:21.070 --> 08:22.300
Perhaps during it.

08:22.301 --> 08:25.369
Now we swabbed the area around
his neck to check for DNA.

08:26.663 --> 08:29.319
Would you care to give us
a sample for comparison ?

08:31.430 --> 08:33.160
Patrick was so cute.

08:33.164 --> 08:35.881
I just wanted to experience
that feeling again.

08:38.765 --> 08:42.390
- Okay... Okay !
- Come on.

08:50.416 --> 08:52.050
Still like that ?

08:52.161 --> 08:53.144
Oh, you know it.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.767
But to him, I was still a skank.

08:57.445 --> 08:58.483
Hear that ?

08:58.484 --> 09:00.466
I requested our song.

09:00.467 --> 09:02.247
We didn't have a song.

09:02.248 --> 09:04.422
Come on. Let's go out there and dance.

09:04.423 --> 09:05.986
What, in public ?
Are you kidding me ?

09:05.987 --> 09:09.504
I didn't take you out in public in
high school. Why would I start now ?

09:14.579 --> 09:17.550
If someone killed him,
I can't say I'm sorry.

09:18.037 --> 09:19.330
But it wasn't me.

09:25.450 --> 09:26.613
Alexx...

09:26.974 --> 09:28.309
Horatio.

09:28.310 --> 09:32.019
So soon ? I was just prepping
the shooting vic from the condo.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.306
Alexx, is that a void in the blood ?

09:40.391 --> 09:42.721
I think our boy was wearing a wire.

09:42.722 --> 09:44.785
Yes, it looks that way.

09:50.364 --> 09:52.074
You don't seem surprised.

09:53.333 --> 09:55.649
Is that a fingerprint right there ?

09:58.553 --> 09:59.416
Yeah.

10:04.015 --> 10:08.022
Whoever removed this wire,
left his print in the adhesive.

10:08.023 --> 10:09.561
Who was this guy ?

10:11.214 --> 10:13.964
No one goes to this much
trouble over a dead dealer.

10:13.965 --> 10:15.172
We do.

10:48.555 --> 10:50.052
We have an audience.

10:50.203 --> 10:52.261
Yes, we do. Give me a
minute, will you, Alexx ?

11:05.810 --> 11:06.810
I had to see for myself.

11:14.979 --> 11:16.766
John... u can't be here.

11:16.871 --> 11:17.881
How'd this mope get out ?

11:17.916 --> 11:20.922
- Cop killers don't get early release...
- John, I need you to stay out of this.

11:21.420 --> 11:22.603
Stay out of this ?

11:22.638 --> 11:24.681
Bob Keaton down
there killed my partner.

11:24.716 --> 11:25.699
Your brother.

11:26.546 --> 11:28.265
What is it you're not telling me ?

11:28.400 --> 11:30.430
I don't have that information yet.

11:30.710 --> 11:32.493
You don't have that information ?

11:32.628 --> 11:34.834
I've been on the outside
since the day Raymond died.

11:34.834 --> 11:35.646
Yes, you have.

11:35.681 --> 11:37.189
And it probably kept you alive.

11:38.988 --> 11:40.087
What's this about ?

11:41.089 --> 11:42.331
I don't know yet.

11:46.112 --> 11:48.145
Just raises so many questions.

11:49.822 --> 11:51.694
I want to get you some answers.

11:53.622 --> 11:55.013
Don't make me wait.

12:06.941 --> 12:09.159
So who removed the
wire from Bob Keaton ?

12:09.266 --> 12:10.801
I don't know. Still searching.

12:10.836 --> 12:13.437
Just switched over from
a local criminal database.

12:13.472 --> 12:14.484
Okay, take your time.

12:17.989 --> 12:20.823
H, I've been thinking
about this crime scene.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.343
The wire, the scene
being processed...

12:26.484 --> 12:28.229
It's above my pay scale, isn't it ?

12:28.763 --> 12:30.054
Maybe all of ours.

12:33.387 --> 12:34.615
Who's this ?

12:34.820 --> 12:36.371
"David Park."

12:38.690 --> 12:41.298
This guy's not a criminal.
He's a GS-14.

12:41.578 --> 12:44.564
David Park has government clearance.

12:45.019 --> 12:47.036
Let's have Homicide bring him in.

12:47.171 --> 12:48.272
Thank you, Eric.

12:51.739 --> 12:53.292
Mr. Park.

12:54.507 --> 12:55.386
Yeah ?

12:55.421 --> 12:57.624
My name is Lieutenant

12:58.531 --> 12:59.977
Horatio Caine.

13:02.784 --> 13:03.856
Caine.

13:04.815 --> 13:08.678
Yes... now, I understand you
work for the federal government.

13:11.589 --> 13:12.687
Census Bureau.

13:13.807 --> 13:15.070
I count people.

13:15.808 --> 13:19.097
Now, a GS-14 clearance is a
little high on the food chain

13:19.132 --> 13:21.056
for a census taker,
don't you think ?

13:23.573 --> 13:24.768
Again,

13:25.573 --> 13:27.019
I count people.

13:30.211 --> 13:35.219
Well, I guess that could explain why
I recovered your fingerprint from my victim.

13:35.329 --> 13:37.219
And that would also tell me

13:37.755 --> 13:39.939
that you removed his surveillance wire.

13:51.653 --> 13:53.511
So that's how you tracked me down.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.272
But you're wasting your time.
I didn't kill Bob Keaton.

13:57.397 --> 13:59.271
But you did process the scene,

13:59.306 --> 14:01.249
which means you do know

14:01.606 --> 14:02.928
who did kill him.

14:04.329 --> 14:06.081
I'm not at liberty to say.

14:07.693 --> 14:08.872
Mr. Park,

14:09.345 --> 14:11.172
what can you tell me?

14:11.952 --> 14:14.030
That this case doesn't exist.

14:14.165 --> 14:15.504
And neither do I.

14:19.367 --> 14:20.432
Well, then,

14:20.967 --> 14:22.542
how do you explain me?

14:27.351 --> 14:28.552
Lieutenant Caine...

14:30.235 --> 14:33.036
nothing good comes
from waking ghosts.

14:34.195 --> 14:35.940
I think you know what I mean.

14:37.375 --> 14:39.061
But if you can wake them,

14:39.136 --> 14:40.393
then maybe...

14:41.068 --> 14:42.557
they're not ghosts.

14:44.746 --> 14:45.600
Hey, Alexx.

14:45.728 --> 14:46.843
Hey, Ryan.

14:46.878 --> 14:49.103
Did you determine the cause
of death on my quarterback ?

14:50.111 --> 14:52.581
Blunt-force trauma was the cause.

14:53.209 --> 14:57.170
And I may have also found
the person who caused it.

14:57.393 --> 14:59.097
I found this in his pants pocket.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.386
I know about the curve,
you're a dead man.

15:06.678 --> 15:08.046
"Curve..."

15:08.081 --> 15:09.357
What kind of curve ?

15:09.861 --> 15:13.118
Whatever it was, guess it was
something worth killing for.

15:13.353 --> 15:14.675
That's weird.

15:15.552 --> 15:17.241
Note has perforated edges.

15:18.417 --> 15:21.138
It looks like dot-matrix
printer paper.

15:21.627 --> 15:23.901
Who uses that kind
of paper these days ?

15:24.711 --> 15:26.054
Exactly.

15:35.956 --> 15:37.717
I didn't write any note to Patrick.

15:38.185 --> 15:39.899
You pulled me out of
the reunion for this ?

15:39.934 --> 15:40.981
Yeah, we did.

15:41.016 --> 15:42.667
You wrote the note 15 years ago.

15:43.846 --> 15:45.093
You can't prove that.

15:45.766 --> 15:47.628
The paper was the first indication.

15:48.616 --> 15:50.391
Obsolete brand, slight yellowing.

15:50.426 --> 15:52.254
But the ink you used...

15:52.689 --> 15:54.132
the ink told us the rest.

15:54.819 --> 15:57.069
We extracted the ink
from the note, Kevin.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.724
From 1969 to 1994,

16:13.799 --> 16:16.724
consumer ink was infused
with a Coumarin compound.

16:16.759 --> 16:18.189
It's a plant extract.

16:18.946 --> 16:20.497
They're called chemical date tags.

16:20.532 --> 16:23.778
Determine the compound and get
the year the ink was manufactured.

16:24.013 --> 16:27.598
Once the ink's extracted, it's analyzed
with thin layer chromatography.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.310
The tags react to ultraviolet light.

16:49.716 --> 16:54.408
Which shows the ink on your note
was made of compounds C, A, and B.

16:54.608 --> 16:57.744
Which is unique to only one year : 1990.

16:57.779 --> 16:59.930
And the writing,
unique to one person.

17:00.024 --> 17:00.926
You.

17:01.443 --> 17:04.128
Krystal Sneed's Class of '90 yearbook.

17:04.364 --> 17:05.948
Which you signed.

17:06.183 --> 17:08.297
We matched the handwriting to your note.

17:12.009 --> 17:13.987
"I know about the curve.
You're a dead man. "

17:16.719 --> 17:18.977
He stole the science midterm test.

17:19.012 --> 17:20.537
Got a bogus 98.

17:20.571 --> 17:22.143
Set the curve for the rest of us.

17:22.178 --> 17:24.118
Made my 91 look like a "C".

17:24.847 --> 17:26.165
Kept me out of Vanderbilt.

17:28.705 --> 17:31.289
And you waited 15 years for revenge.

17:33.014 --> 17:34.058
What ?

17:34.686 --> 17:36.118
I- I didn't kill him.

17:36.153 --> 17:38.275
Krystal told our homicide
detective that she saw

17:38.276 --> 17:40.398
you and Patrick arguing
right before he was killed.

17:40.970 --> 17:41.874
Kevin.

17:41.909 --> 17:42.834
Bro.

17:42.869 --> 17:45.602
Always expected you to show up
at Vanderbilt, and, uh,

17:45.717 --> 17:48.016
follow through on your threat.

17:49.407 --> 17:50.200
You kept that ?

17:50.235 --> 17:51.358
It's ancient history, man.

17:51.393 --> 17:52.786
Hey, I still feel bad.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.288
I mean, I heard where you ended up.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.764
Community college ?

17:55.799 --> 17:57.266
You trying to rub my nose in it ?

17:57.301 --> 18:00.304
Hey, I'm saying it's my bad.

18:00.339 --> 18:00.932
Yeah ?

18:00.967 --> 18:02.556
Dude, tell me something I don't know.

18:06.534 --> 18:09.125
My net worth is like ten times his.

18:09.667 --> 18:12.375
I was looking forward to rubbing
that in his face at the picnic.

18:14.743 --> 18:16.179
Don't go far, Mr. Banks.

18:19.180 --> 18:20.269
Right this way.

18:21.700 --> 18:22.956
So what now ?

18:24.298 --> 18:26.365
Check with Dr. Talcott in DNA.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.380
See if our murder weapon is
telling us anything, would you ?

18:29.515 --> 18:30.274
Yup.

18:30.747 --> 18:32.493
The reunion murder, right ?

18:32.728 --> 18:33.472
Yeah.

18:33.507 --> 18:36.452
Uh, is there any non-victim
blood on our champagne bottle ?

18:36.487 --> 18:38.540
No, but I did find
something else, though.

18:44.896 --> 18:46.440
There's something in the blood.

18:46.572 --> 18:47.869
Any idea what it could be ?

18:48.933 --> 18:50.760
Whatever it is, it's
underneath the blood.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.237
So it was stuck on the bottle
before it was used as a weapon.

18:54.342 --> 18:55.932
Yeah, I gotta get this to Trace.

18:55.932 --> 18:56.875
Thanks.

19:02.310 --> 19:04.079
That from the Bob Keaton murder ?

19:05.934 --> 19:07.180
Dusting powder.

19:08.658 --> 19:10.124
All they got was smudges.

19:13.522 --> 19:14.981
Dusting powder...

19:20.070 --> 19:22.156
Eric, here's what I want you to do.

19:22.191 --> 19:24.562
Let's stay focused on
this powder, okay ?

19:24.597 --> 19:25.541
Get it over to Aaron,

19:25.676 --> 19:27.429
- see what we get.
- Okay, good.

19:27.676 --> 19:28.509
Ma'am...

19:29.134 --> 19:30.717
When were you going to tell me ?

19:32.188 --> 19:33.251
Excuse me.

19:35.190 --> 19:36.189
Tell you what ?

19:38.268 --> 19:41.012
Last week you were looking
at Ray's old case files.

19:41.658 --> 19:42.825
And now today,

19:42.860 --> 19:46.054
a man I thought was locked
up for the rest of his life,

19:46.089 --> 19:48.803
the man that killed my
husband, was murdered.

19:51.282 --> 19:52.772
I'm still working on that.

19:53.572 --> 19:56.581
You see the way I have this is that
if Bob Keaton got out of prison,

19:56.616 --> 19:58.172
that tells me he wasn't Ray's killer.

20:00.129 --> 20:01.475
Horatio, don't lie.

20:02.215 --> 20:03.398
Do you trust me ?

20:03.433 --> 20:04.390
I thought I could.

20:04.425 --> 20:07.908
I need you to trust me until I
have something real to tell you.

20:08.143 --> 20:09.680
Okay ?

20:09.715 --> 20:11.835
You promise me ?
Promise ?

20:12.393 --> 20:13.667
Of course.

20:44.095 --> 20:44.936
Hey.

20:45.351 --> 20:46.295
Alexx,

20:46.551 --> 20:47.595
what is that ?

20:49.042 --> 20:52.153
The shooter left a calling
card our competitor missed.

20:55.298 --> 20:56.405
Muzzle stamp.

20:56.510 --> 20:58.712
It was under the mess.
They didn't know to look for it.

20:58.747 --> 21:00.168
But we did, didn't we ?

21:00.823 --> 21:03.895
The killer got close
for the second shot.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.237
The heat softened Bob's skin.

21:06.282 --> 21:08.241
And then the muzzle smashed into it.

21:14.353 --> 21:16.404
The muzzle with an imperfection, Alexx.

21:16.439 --> 21:19.871
This demarcation is unique
only to the killer's gun.

21:20.106 --> 21:21.811
So we find that gun,

21:21.846 --> 21:24.905
we match it to this imperfection,
we have our killer.

21:31.210 --> 21:33.899
Here's the thing, you need
to protect your family. OK ?

21:33.934 --> 21:36.129
Policies start at $250,000.

21:36.164 --> 21:37.806
We offer term or whole life.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.239
You really can't go wrong.

21:42.062 --> 21:42.929
Think about it, Sally.

21:42.964 --> 21:45.799
People don't plan to fail,
but they do fail to plan.

21:47.811 --> 21:49.060
It's great to see you.

21:50.492 --> 21:51.999
Sir, may I talk with you for a minute ?

21:52.878 --> 21:54.719
Yeah, officer.
What can I do you for ?

21:56.048 --> 21:57.554
You lost your name tag.

22:00.112 --> 22:01.903
I didn't go to this school.

22:03.632 --> 22:06.133
So you go to reunions
for the sheer fun of it ?

22:09.242 --> 22:10.205
What is that ?

22:09.457 --> 22:10.531
What is that ?

22:10.816 --> 22:12.532
Oh, it's a mortality clock.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.942
It shows you how many seconds
you have left on this Earth.

22:14.971 --> 22:18.500
You factor in age, habits, height
and weight, and statistics tell the rest.

22:18.521 --> 22:22.109
But the class of '90's going
to start dropping around 2055.

22:22.639 --> 22:25.918
So you sell life insurance
at the reunion ?

22:26.608 --> 22:30.564
It's a perfect place. People are
all focused on their fading youth.

22:30.871 --> 22:37.077
I know, it's sleazy, but it's working.
I go to class reunions all over the state.

22:37.546 --> 22:40.149
Our detective said he saw
you talking to the victim's wife.

22:40.208 --> 22:41.502
I was consoling her.

22:43.090 --> 22:44.384
How are you holding up ?

22:46.935 --> 22:48.964
Patrick was taken much too soon.

22:49.213 --> 22:51.345
Jennie, yeah, I wanted
to see how she was doing.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.345
I met her when I sold her a policy.

22:53.874 --> 22:56.252
- She bought a policy ?
- On her husband

22:56.362 --> 22:59.334
- last night at the cocktail party.
- Before he was killed ?

23:01.182 --> 23:03.639
Yes. I don't want to get her in trouble.

23:04.624 --> 23:06.408
Do you have the application on you ?

23:16.069 --> 23:18.510
Term policy, a million upon death.

23:18.666 --> 23:20.731
Jennie Hale. She signed it.

23:21.874 --> 23:23.657
Any idea where she is now ?

23:24.411 --> 23:26.962
No, I'd like a small service.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.027
Uh, nothing too pricy.

23:29.653 --> 23:31.890
No, no. Cremation.

23:31.968 --> 23:33.690
That's what my husband
would have wanted.

23:33.721 --> 23:36.710
So Jennie's got a million
reasons to kill her husband.

23:36.834 --> 23:38.195
Should we bring her in ?

23:41.347 --> 23:44.742
I want forensic proof.
She'll wiggle out of it too easily.

23:44.851 --> 23:46.807
Everyone bought one of those policies.

23:47.007 --> 23:49.507
We may have forensic proof.
There was trace on the murder weapon,

23:49.507 --> 23:51.263
- Bahamian aragonite.
- Sand ?

23:58.571 --> 24:01.971
Produced by coral reefs in the Bahamas,
high pH, large granule size,

24:01.971 --> 24:03.312
unique to the region.

24:04.267 --> 24:07.509
- So our killer was in the Bahamas.
- Not necessarily.

24:07.865 --> 24:09.430
Remember that yearbook we looked at ?

24:14.969 --> 24:18.599
Oh, yeah. "Senior class trip
to the Bahamas was awesome."

24:18.710 --> 24:21.745
I got a way to find out where
that champagne bottle came from,

24:22.747 --> 24:24.717
but we're going to have
to go back in time.

24:31.149 --> 24:32.007
Hey, Krystal,

24:32.386 --> 24:33.496
wait up a minute.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.139
Oh, officer.

24:35.217 --> 24:36.860
Where you going with the time capsule ?

24:37.017 --> 24:37.908
Home.

24:38.316 --> 24:40.882
Unveiling it was supposed
to be a special event.

24:40.976 --> 24:42.712
The whole weekend's ruined.

24:42.822 --> 24:46.201
I mean, some things
you just can't party plan.

24:46.640 --> 24:50.708
You know, actually, I'd like to see
the contents if you don't mind.

24:53.032 --> 24:55.426
At least someone will get
to see the time capsule.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.194
Here's the list.

25:08.898 --> 25:11.558
We buried it underground
right before graduation.

25:11.652 --> 25:13.576
All our favorite memories.

25:16.591 --> 25:19.031
"Rubik's Cube, Atari 2600,

25:19.502 --> 25:20.894
Whitesnake CD,

25:20.957 --> 25:22.474
President Bush elected."

25:22.505 --> 25:24.023
That's the first one, right ?

25:25.666 --> 25:27.105
Dubé champagne."

25:28.248 --> 25:30.001
The same brand as the murder weapon.

25:34.382 --> 25:36.056
The bottle's not in there.

25:37.292 --> 25:38.826
Did you take it out, Krystal ?

25:39.060 --> 25:40.953
What do you mean, take it out ? No !

25:42.361 --> 25:43.659
Oh, my God !

25:44.608 --> 25:46.047
Our beach in a jar.

25:46.094 --> 25:47.346
It broke !

25:49.051 --> 25:50.398
That might be evidence.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.330
Evidence ? I'm confused.

25:52.463 --> 25:56.171
Let me guess. You brought it back from
your trip senior year in the Bahamas ?

25:56.202 --> 25:57.563
How'd you know ?

25:58.066 --> 26:00.632
Are you the only one with
a key to the time capsule ?

26:01.258 --> 26:02.744
Well, there's one other person.

26:02.858 --> 26:05.044
Not that she ever cared
about the class project.

26:05.232 --> 26:07.032
She just loved the attention.

26:12.681 --> 26:13.322
So ?

26:13.635 --> 26:15.732
I opened your little time capsule.

26:16.389 --> 26:18.704
Still as lame as the day we buried it.

26:18.791 --> 26:20.527
You removed the champagne bottle,

26:20.652 --> 26:22.812
breaking the glass jar
in the process, didn't you ?

26:41.718 --> 26:44.343
Okay, yeah. I took the bottle.

26:44.422 --> 26:47.629
The same bottle that was used
to kill Patrick shortly afterwards ?

26:48.020 --> 26:49.835
You're putting words in my mouth.

26:49.961 --> 26:52.668
It used to be Patrick's favorite,
so I brought it to our hook up.

26:54.945 --> 26:57.119
Remember this ? Dubé champagne.

26:57.151 --> 26:59.904
Yeah, sure, great, we'll
drink it after. Come on.

27:00.647 --> 27:02.743
- Okay. Okay.
- Come on !

27:08.113 --> 27:10.960
I left the bottle on the floor, unopened.

27:13.496 --> 27:16.281
You're only going after me
because of my reputation.

27:16.594 --> 27:18.034
A person's

27:18.409 --> 27:21.538
character does enter
into an investigation.

27:21.639 --> 27:22.813
Character ?

27:23.120 --> 27:25.560
I have a job, a condo,

27:25.701 --> 27:27.688
nieces that love me.

27:27.985 --> 27:29.706
I left high school,

27:30.208 --> 27:32.038
not like some of the
people at the reunion.

27:32.085 --> 27:33.556
Oh, yeah, like who ?

27:34.221 --> 27:35.324
Take your pick :

27:35.324 --> 27:40.026
cheerleaders, band geeks, rockers,
stoners, loners. It's just like they never left.

27:40.136 --> 27:41.451
I mean, look at Dan.

27:41.513 --> 27:43.328
He's still a total outcast.

27:43.813 --> 27:44.564
Dan ?

27:45.143 --> 27:46.340
Life insurance Dan ?

27:47.842 --> 27:49.031
Dan Winslet.

27:50.635 --> 27:52.450
Dropped out freshman year,

27:52.490 --> 27:53.757
but still shows up

27:53.804 --> 27:55.040
to our reunion.

27:55.071 --> 27:56.808
What kind of loser would do that ?

27:58.280 --> 27:59.813
We're going to find out.

28:00.908 --> 28:02.942
I'm serious, guys.
You're making a mistake.

28:03.036 --> 28:05.056
No, we're not. Get your
hands out, Mr. Winslet.

28:06.464 --> 28:07.340
What ?

28:08.232 --> 28:10.923
You didn't go to the reunion
to sell insurance, did you ?

28:14.914 --> 28:17.401
Yes, I did. I told you before.

28:23.583 --> 28:25.601
I got blood smeared.

28:26.337 --> 28:28.934
There was smeared blood on the
floor where Patrick was killed.

28:29.309 --> 28:31.656
How much you want to bet
that's our victim's blood ?

28:35.099 --> 28:36.585
Puts you at the scene, Dan.

28:37.774 --> 28:39.480
Do you care to talk about that ?

28:55.416 --> 28:57.294
I should have been part of that class.

28:58.827 --> 29:00.032
It's all his fault.

29:00.918 --> 29:02.592
Freshman year, locker room.

29:02.639 --> 29:06.745
Dansy the pansy. Shouldn't have
told Coach I blew off practice.

29:06.886 --> 29:08.466
That'll keep you from talking !

29:09.483 --> 29:10.484
Yeah !

29:13.100 --> 29:14.070
Good night !

29:16.949 --> 29:18.952
You want to know how long
I was in the hospital ?

29:20.392 --> 29:22.754
How long it took them
to get that tape off me ?

29:31.962 --> 29:33.136
Skin grafts.

29:37.251 --> 29:39.785
I can't take off my shirt
in front of anyone.

29:39.975 --> 29:41.430
Not that I even have anyone.

29:43.277 --> 29:45.608
- Do you blame Patrick for the life you have ?
- No.

29:47.235 --> 29:48.846
For taking the life I could have had.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.631
Bastard !

29:59.122 --> 30:01.234
- I know you ?
- You should.

30:01.782 --> 30:03.941
Well, I guess more people remember me.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.114
Dan Winslet.

30:05.614 --> 30:06.709
Freshman year.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.618
Dansy the pansy !

30:09.597 --> 30:10.958
What's up, man ?

30:12.460 --> 30:13.837
I want an apology

30:14.338 --> 30:15.558
for what you did.

30:17.577 --> 30:18.782
Whatever it was,

30:19.298 --> 30:20.338
get over it.

30:26.305 --> 30:27.369
Man, wait !

30:47.616 --> 30:49.337
He didn't even remember
what he did to me.

30:49.368 --> 30:50.808
So he took your life...

30:51.793 --> 30:53.155
and you took his.

30:58.589 --> 30:59.950
Mortality clock.

31:01.249 --> 31:03.690
Counts down the remainder
of someone's life.

31:06.954 --> 31:08.456
Or their life sentence.

31:16.218 --> 31:16.984
Eric,

31:17.188 --> 31:18.188
the powder ?

31:18.282 --> 31:21.229
You were right. Some of the trace we
found in Bob's apartment was cocaine.

31:21.256 --> 31:22.773
What was it cut with ?

31:22.923 --> 31:27.710
Vitamin A, Vitamin C, and
five percent bisacodyl. It's a laxative.

31:27.968 --> 31:31.316
Now, we have this mixture in
our library. It's Julio Pena's cut.

31:31.505 --> 31:33.305
Calls it the Colombian Health High.

31:33.383 --> 31:36.340
Yes, well, it's time
for Julio to come down.

32:04.162 --> 32:06.305
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Julio Pena ?

32:06.338 --> 32:10.140
I wanna know why were you
at Bob Keaton's apartment today.

32:10.375 --> 32:12.542
Lily white doper ? What you think ?

32:12.792 --> 32:14.779
I'm guessing that you
might have killed him.

32:15.789 --> 32:18.198
I was there, sure.
Boy postured like he's seasoned.

32:19.239 --> 32:19.975
Feels light.

32:19.990 --> 32:21.915
Which would mean a lot
if you were a scale.

32:22.024 --> 32:23.338
Do you want it or no ?

32:23.847 --> 32:26.304
Now it is light.
I'm losing my patience.

32:26.399 --> 32:28.151
$800 or the deal is off.

32:28.558 --> 32:29.794
Deal's off.

32:31.499 --> 32:32.704
I'm out of here.

32:33.064 --> 32:35.332
See, there's a problem
with your story, Julio.

32:35.443 --> 32:36.757
What, no happy ending ?

32:36.788 --> 32:39.902
No, whoever shot Bob left
evidence of their gun on him.

32:40.653 --> 32:41.560
Okay.

32:43.524 --> 32:46.653
Look, I brought an associate with me.
New guy, loose cannon,

32:46.810 --> 32:50.112
- name of Luis, Luis Rivera.
- And Luis shot Bob ?

32:50.793 --> 32:51.810
You ask him.

32:51.935 --> 32:53.983
Until we find Luis, Julio,

32:54.103 --> 32:56.347
we're going to hang onto you.
Step over to the car, please.

32:56.473 --> 32:59.790
Let's go, Julio.
Right over here. Let's go.

33:09.773 --> 33:10.543
Eric !

33:12.557 --> 33:14.123
I don't see anyone.

33:26.963 --> 33:28.797
Shift into Plan "B".

33:49.696 --> 33:51.437
Luis Rivera

33:51.541 --> 33:52.416
hold up.

33:54.864 --> 33:57.062
Luis, you got to change up
your routine, man.

33:57.074 --> 33:58.025
I didn't do nothing wrong.

33:58.116 --> 33:59.849
Yeah, you wake up,
and you're already wrong.

33:59.850 --> 34:00.663
Let's get him up.

34:04.374 --> 34:06.264
Mmm. Concealed weapon.

34:07.310 --> 34:09.532
The gun's going to the lab ;
you're coming with us.

34:09.675 --> 34:10.708
Let's go, guys.

34:18.761 --> 34:20.120
You shoot Julio ?

34:20.259 --> 34:21.909
I didn't cap nobody.

34:22.670 --> 34:24.965
That's all right. We'll get
the bullet from autopsy.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.931
Well, when you do,
get back to me.

34:28.235 --> 34:29.246
Are we done ?

34:30.427 --> 34:33.371
Not quite, Luis.

34:36.228 --> 34:37.112
What's that ?

34:37.951 --> 34:41.164
That is your confession
for another murder.

34:42.445 --> 34:43.559
What murder ?

34:44.005 --> 34:45.248
Bob Keaton.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.254
Muzzle stamp's identical.

34:47.496 --> 34:49.650
Bob's chest, your gun.

34:49.904 --> 34:51.460
800 or deal is off.

34:51.473 --> 34:52.741
Then it's off.

34:53.154 --> 34:54.358
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:55.431 --> 34:56.915
Five. I'll give you five.

34:56.985 --> 34:58.033
Now you negotiate ?

34:58.118 --> 35:00.435
Luis, show him my counteroffer.

35:01.921 --> 35:04.446
- I'm out of here.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

35:22.871 --> 35:24.143
You killed him.

35:27.946 --> 35:29.051
Julio's the boss.

35:29.379 --> 35:31.157
Maybe you took care of that, too.

35:32.741 --> 35:34.095
No, I swear. I didn't.

35:34.274 --> 35:36.686
Then why, Luis, are you alive

35:36.686 --> 35:38.101
and Julio's dead ?

35:41.761 --> 35:43.021
I'm cagey, man.

35:44.076 --> 35:46.765
Not cagey. Meaningless.

35:51.870 --> 35:53.344
Got the bullet from Julio ?

35:54.323 --> 35:56.472
Right here.
22-caliber.

35:58.965 --> 36:00.705
Long rifle used for distance.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.926
And not a match to Luis's gun.

36:03.259 --> 36:04.875
What else, Alexx ?

36:05.256 --> 36:08.964
Julio's got ulcerations
of the oral mucosa,

36:08.964 --> 36:11.453
stomach and intestines.

36:11.774 --> 36:13.153
That's rare for a young man.

36:13.165 --> 36:14.745
Yeah. And look at this :

36:14.954 --> 36:18.035
He's got burns and lesions
on both hands.

36:18.035 --> 36:20.364
Now the burns could've
come from drug use,

36:20.453 --> 36:22.618
but the lesions, I don't think so.

36:22.845 --> 36:25.146
Alexx, I want to order a CBC.

36:25.473 --> 36:27.108
A complete blood count ?

36:27.466 --> 36:29.577
I don't think this is drug-related.

36:29.869 --> 36:31.733
You think he was killed
for some other reason ?

36:31.899 --> 36:33.235
Not killed.

36:33.545 --> 36:34.573
Assassinated.

37:51.547 --> 37:54.622
Horatio, I've got the results
of the blood work you asked for.

37:54.627 --> 37:56.731
Ran Julio's CBC with a complete

37:56.731 --> 37:58.603
white cell differential.
And look at this :

37:58.709 --> 38:01.545
his lymphocytes
are alarmingly low.

38:01.842 --> 38:04.754
And you couple that with
the ulceration, and, well...

38:05.366 --> 38:06.842
He's been exposed to radiation.

38:06.887 --> 38:07.960
And not a little.

38:08.034 --> 38:09.669
We're talking serious exposure.

38:09.678 --> 38:11.570
This guy was working in this stuff.

38:11.707 --> 38:13.152
Thank you, Alexx.

38:13.888 --> 38:16.345
Eric, we need an address on Julio Pena,

38:16.439 --> 38:18.743
and I need you to
meet me there right now.

38:19.101 --> 38:19.800
Thank you.

38:32.559 --> 38:34.424
All clear. All clear.

38:53.914 --> 38:55.423
- H...
- Yeah.

38:58.890 --> 39:00.561
You've got an X-ray machine.

39:00.661 --> 39:02.492
This is a source of the radiation.

39:02.622 --> 39:06.113
Hazmat didn't register any,
so where'd it go ?

39:07.506 --> 39:09.307
This cable's the pig tail.

39:09.560 --> 39:11.633
Houses an iridium
capsule at one end.

39:11.704 --> 39:14.296
Iridium's the source
of the radiation.

39:16.116 --> 39:17.708
Capsule's been removed.

39:18.013 --> 39:19.998
This is bigger than we thought Eric.

39:20.940 --> 39:22.925
Why was Julio involved in this ?

39:23.788 --> 39:27.165
Because someone was using him
to finance the operation.

39:27.374 --> 39:29.369
So Julio was caught in
between the two worlds.

39:29.382 --> 39:32.136
Whoever did this needed
to get to him before we did.

39:37.186 --> 39:38.553
Got a serial number.

39:38.867 --> 39:40.994
We need to trace that number.

39:54.145 --> 39:57.113
Mr. Thomason,
last year you purchased

39:57.121 --> 39:58.580
ten X-ray machines.

39:59.877 --> 40:02.905
For welding seams. I'm planning
to start a construction company.

40:02.920 --> 40:04.693
Then explain to me
how one of them ended up

40:04.726 --> 40:06.674
in Julio Pena's workshop.

40:07.907 --> 40:09.283
Don't know who that is.

40:11.903 --> 40:15.919
Mr. Pena sells drugs in order
to purchase the machines.

40:15.919 --> 40:19.404
Once in his possession,
he dissembled them.

40:19.613 --> 40:21.182
Dissembled them ?

40:21.608 --> 40:23.750
- Why would anyone do that ?
- Excuse me.

40:23.983 --> 40:24.767
Excuse me... !

40:24.767 --> 40:26.129
This conversation is over.

40:26.210 --> 40:27.957
Mr. Thomason, you're under arrest.

40:27.958 --> 40:28.904
Please stand up.

40:29.913 --> 40:31.249
Couldn't leave it alone,
could you, Caine ?

40:31.346 --> 40:32.589
Hang on a second, gentlemen.

40:32.767 --> 40:36.237
Now I am conducting
an investigation in this room.

40:36.961 --> 40:38.830
Say good-bye to Mr. Thomason.

40:39.176 --> 40:42.233
He's our suspect now.
Fed trumps county.

40:42.325 --> 40:43.299
Get him out of here.

40:50.569 --> 40:53.083
Thomason was leading us
to his contacts.

40:53.256 --> 40:55.561
- We were closing in.
- Closing in on what ?

40:56.308 --> 40:57.884
I can't discuss it.

40:59.988 --> 41:02.827
This would be a good time
for you to start.

41:04.234 --> 41:06.588
This isn't just smoke and mirrors.

41:07.004 --> 41:08.365
There are people in our country,

41:08.366 --> 41:10.350
this very state in fact,
who want to do us harm.

41:10.350 --> 41:12.238
Answer my question.

41:13.666 --> 41:15.663
Haven't you heard
of the greater good ?

41:16.242 --> 41:18.688
Was my brother Raymond
involved in this ?

41:19.201 --> 41:20.754
And I want the truth.

41:23.006 --> 41:24.451
Raymond's dead.

41:25.196 --> 41:28.532
Now we both know that's not true.

41:31.895 --> 41:33.579
You keep digging...

41:33.889 --> 41:35.478
and it will be.

42:12.942 --> 42:14.917
I did some checking of my own.

42:15.656 --> 42:19.021
Bob Keaton's release was
approved by federal authorities.

42:19.627 --> 42:21.091
He was a Fed, wasn't he ?

42:23.795 --> 42:27.078
Yelina, Bob Keaton was a DEA agent.

42:30.726 --> 42:31.934
And Raymond ?

42:41.034 --> 42:42.529
I need to know.

42:46.665 --> 42:48.754
I have the right to know.

42:51.521 --> 42:54.019
Horatio, is he still...

42:55.453 --> 42:57.084
is he still alive ?

43:00.274 --> 43:01.338
It's possible.

43:01.659 --> 43:02.733
It's possible.

43:04.172 --> 43:05.152
Oh, my God.

43:32.870 --> 43:34.217
What are we going to do ?

43:37.791 --> 43:39.351
Everything we can.
