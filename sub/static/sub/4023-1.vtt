THE HAMPTONS,

12:48.936 --> 12:51.004

ONLY BECAUSE
I LOVE YOU.

12:54.007 --> 12:57.010

OPERATION.

12:57.010 --> 13:00.013
YOU SHOULD WANT

FOR YOURSELF.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.614
YOU'VE WORKED

13:03.616 --> 13:05.618
TO THE BEST
COUNTRY CLUB.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.420
THEY'RE A BUNCH
OF SNOBS.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.423
LOOK AT THE NAMES
THEY GIVE THEIR KIDS.

13:10.423 --> 13:14.027
"THIS-AND-THIS JUNIOR,
THIS-AND-THIS THE FIRST."

13:14.027 --> 13:18.198
HOW BRILLIANT!
THEY CAN'T EVEN
THINK OF A NEW NAME.

13:18.198 --> 13:21.634
DON'T CONDEMN THEM
JUST BECAUSE
THEY HAVE ROOTS.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.437
THEY GOT ROOTS
LIKE AN OAK TREE.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.439
WE GOT ROOTS
LIKE RADISHES.

13:26.439 --> 13:30.643
I DON'T WANT
TO BE A RADISH
ALL MY LIFE,

13:30.643 --> 13:33.113

13:54.067 --> 13:56.669
I KNEW A GIRL

PROBABLY
FOR DIFFERENT
REASONS.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.806
HEH HEH.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.674
SHE WAS UGLY.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.077
SHE HAD
A COMING-OUT PARTY.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.646
THEY MADE HER
GO BACK!

14:06.646 --> 14:08.681
WELL,

14:08.681 --> 14:10.483
TODD'S WAITING FOR US

14:10.483 --> 14:14.087

14:59.366 --> 15:01.201
DOES IT SHOW?

15:03.436 --> 15:07.274
YOU LOOK SICK.
I DON'T WANT TO
CAUSE PROBLEMS.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.760
JACK!

15:27.760 --> 15:29.796
YOU'RE WORKING HARD,
AS USUAL.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.764
MANAGING
A LARGE INHERITANCE

15:31.764 --> 15:33.566
IS A FULL-TIME JOB.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.736
LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTANTS
SEND ME THINGS.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.571
GOT TO SIGN THINGS.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.508
HARD WORK FOR
A COUPLE MILLION A YEAR.

15:41.508 --> 15:45.578
I WAS BORN
WITH A WOODEN SPOON
IN MY MOUTH.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.948
MUST'VE BEEN
HARD ON YOUR MOTHER.
STILL BUILDING?

15:48.948 --> 15:51.184
YEAH.
LOW-INCOME HOUSING.

15:51.184 --> 15:55.188
NO MONEY IN IT,
BUT I SLEEP WELL
AT NIGHT.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.991
I SLEEP WELL
DURING THE DAYTIME.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.959
WHERE?

HEY, WHO BUILT
THIS THING, ANYWAY?

16:17.410 --> 16:18.811
THERE WE GO.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.414
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE,
JACK.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.621
YOU KNOW ME, JACK.

16:28.621 --> 16:32.225
I BELIEVE
A HEALTHY LIFE NEEDS
A BALANCE BETWEEN

16:32.225 --> 16:34.627
WORK AND PLAY,
YIN AND YANG.

16:34.627 --> 16:38.831
I HEARD YOU GET
MORE YANG THAN
YOU CAN HANDLE.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.433

16:59.186 --> 17:02.522
IT'S FOR
MY DAUGHTER'S SAKE.
I COULDN'T CARE LESS.

17:02.522 --> 17:06.726
THIS PLACE IS WHAT
THE WORLD WOULD'VE
LOOKED LIKE

17:06.726 --> 17:08.861
IF THE GERMANS
HAD WON.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.263
LUCKY FOR US
THE JAPANESE WON.

17:11.263 --> 17:13.800
I SHOULD
INTRODUCE YOU
AROUND.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.667
DO YOU
HAVE TO?

17:15.667 --> 17:19.271
JUST RELAX.
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS TO BE YOURSELF--

17:19.271 --> 17:21.741
AND LOSE THE ACCENT.

17:21.741 --> 17:24.111
WHAT ACCENT?

17:24.111 --> 17:27.280
JACK HARTOUNIAN,
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET

I'M MIFFY'S FATHER,
CHANDLER YOUNG.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.721
CHANDLER YOUNG.

18:08.721 --> 18:12.058
I'M AFRAID I ONLY HAVE
ONE LAST NAME.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.794
AND AN INTERESTING
NAME IT IS.

18:14.794 --> 18:15.828
HARTOUNIAN.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.764
WHAT IS YOUR BACKGROUND?

18:17.764 --> 18:19.532
MY FATHER WAS
ARMENIAN.

18:19.532 --> 18:22.835
MY MOTHER WAS
HALF-JEWISH, ENGLISH, SPANISH.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.337
THAT'S THREE HALVES.

18:24.337 --> 18:27.073
SHE WAS A BIG WOMAN.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.741
HA HA HA!

18:28.741 --> 18:31.344
JACK, CHANDLER IS
THE CLUB PRESIDENT.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.946
YOU CAN PLAY GOLF
WITH HIM,

18:33.946 --> 18:35.948
MAYBE
HAVE A COCKTAIL,

18:35.948 --> 18:38.451
MAYBE SOME
LIGHT PETTING LATER?

18:38.451 --> 18:41.654
WELL, I GOT
A THING.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.558
HE'S A LITTLE STRANGE.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.567

18:54.567 --> 18:55.435
OH!

18:55.435 --> 18:57.370

ELIZABETH PEARCE.

18:57.370 --> 19:00.106

YOUR SUIT.

19:00.106 --> 19:03.376
YOU'RE A REAL
NICE-LOOKING PERSON.

19:03.376 --> 19:06.379
SHOULD I COME BACK
WHEN YOU'RE DRESSED?

19:06.379 --> 19:09.182
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'M PLEASED
TO MEET YOU.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.984
LOOK WHAT I DID.
I'M SORRY.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.920
IS THAT
WHERE THAT GOES?

19:13.920 --> 19:17.857
MOST WOMEN I KNOW
PUT THAT IN A DIFFERENT
LOCATION.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.992
I DON'T NEED ANY
THERE.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.195
I'VE ASKED ELIZABETH
AND MY WIFE

19:22.195 --> 19:24.797
TO JOIN US
FOR A FOURSOME.

19:24.797 --> 19:28.801
I WOULDN'T MIND
A FOURSOME
OR TWO TWOSOMES

19:28.801 --> 19:31.137
OR MAYBE
FOUR ONESOMES.

19:31.137 --> 19:33.139
AND THIS IS
MY WIFE,

19:33.139 --> 19:34.607

19:39.512 --> 19:41.414
OH, NO.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.416
IT'S OUT OF
THE QUESTION.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.419
I REFUSE
TO PLAY GOLF
WITH THIS MAN.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.020
THEN YOU'VE MET?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.689
THIS IS THE MAN

19:49.689 --> 19:52.024
WHO'S DESTROYING
OUR COMMUNITY.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.427
IT WAS
A LITTLE DISAGREEMENT.

19:54.427 --> 19:57.697
HE TRIED TO RUN
ME OVER WITH
A STEAMROLLER!

19:57.697 --> 20:02.168
WHAT STEAMROLLER?
IT WAS A BULLDOZER. HEH HEH.

20:02.168 --> 20:05.438
I REALLY HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

20:05.438 --> 20:08.375
I WAS WRONG.
I'M TERRIBLY, TERRIBLY SORRY.

20:08.375 --> 20:11.043
DARLING, A WORD?

20:11.043 --> 20:13.045
EXCUSE US
FOR A MOMENT.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.181
JACK, LET'S GET
OUR CLUBS.

20:15.181 --> 20:17.083
LET'S NOT
MAKE A SCENE.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.051
HE TRIED
TO KILL ME.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.053
I'M SURE HE HAD
REASONS.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.889
I PROMISED MIFFY
WE'D PLAY.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.458
IT'S FUNNY
RUNNING INTO
MRS. YOUNG.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.627
WAS THE FIRST TIME
FUNNIER?

20:27.627 --> 20:29.862
BESIDES, THIS IS
AN OPPORTUNITY

20:29.862 --> 20:32.865
FOR YOU TO SAVE
THE ARMSTRONG
ESTATE.

20:32.865 --> 20:36.068
YOU'LL CATCH
MORE FLIES
WITH HONEY.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.504

20:37.504 --> 20:40.973
DON'T WORRY.
I WON'T RUN HEAVY
EQUIPMENT INTO YOU.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.215
THIS SHOULD BE FUN,
YOU THINK?

20:49.215 --> 20:51.250
I DON'T SEE HOW.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.486
JACK, GIVE YOU
THE HONOR.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.489
LOOK AT THIS.
I'M HERE 15 MINUTES

20:56.489 --> 20:59.492
AND ALREADY
THEY WANT TO
GIVE ME HONORS.

20:59.492 --> 21:03.162
THAT MEANS
THEY WANT YOU
TO TEE OFF FIRST.

21:03.162 --> 21:06.098
OH...
HERE GOES.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.968

BE IT.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.290
WHAT WOULD YOU
CALL THAT?

21:33.125 --> 21:35.161
IT'S A 12-GAUGE.

21:35.161 --> 21:36.896
12-GAUGE.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.333
[BEEPING]

21:44.537 --> 21:47.139
OUT OF AMMUNITION,
MR. HARTOUNIAN?

21:47.139 --> 21:50.042
A FRIEND OF MINE
AT NASA SENT THIS.

21:50.042 --> 21:53.346
I'M SURPRISED
YOU BOTHER
COMING OUT AT ALL.

21:53.346 --> 21:57.684
WHY NOT DEVELOP A GADGET
THAT ALLOWS YOU
TO STAY INSIDE?

21:57.684 --> 22:02.054
THAT'S FUNNY.
I GOT A FRIEND
WORKING ON THAT, TOO.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.624
[BEEPING]

22:09.996 --> 22:13.400
DOESN'T THAT TAKE
THE SPORT OUT OF IT?

22:13.400 --> 22:16.569
NO. A LOT OF THINGS
COULD GO WRONG.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.971
BATTERIES COULD
GO LOW, GET STATIC.

22:18.971 --> 22:22.174
SOMETIMES THE SIGNAL
INTERFERES WITH
A PACEMAKER.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.175

HUH.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.198
HA HA!

22:46.198 --> 22:48.801
MUST'VE BEEN
THAT CHILIDOG!

22:48.801 --> 22:52.539
HE WANTS
TO BECOME A MEMBER.
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

22:52.539 --> 22:57.410
YEAH. WITH THAT MAN AROUND,
I CAN IMAGINE ANYTHING!

22:59.479 --> 23:01.614
SO...
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

23:01.614 --> 23:04.617
ARE MY CHANCES
OF BECOMING A MEMBER?

23:04.617 --> 23:06.619
THAT DEPENDS
ON YOU, JACK.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.621
THIS IS A LOVELY
NEIGHBORHOOD.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.624
PEOPLE HATE TO
SEE IT MUCKED UP

23:11.624 --> 23:13.225
WITH CHEAP
APARTMENTS.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.628
I CAN'T TELL YOU
YOUR BUSINESS,

23:15.628 --> 23:18.631
BUT YOU KNOW,
ONE HAND WASHES
THE OTHER.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.232
YOU WOULDN'T
DISAPPOINT

23:20.232 --> 23:22.902
YOUR DAUGHTER,
WOULD YOU?

23:22.902 --> 23:24.236
THERE'S DADDY.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.539
OH! HI.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.643
I CERTAINLY
WOULDN'T.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.645
LET'S GET
A MEMBERSHIP
APPLICATION

23:32.645 --> 23:34.981
AND LEAVE
BUSINESS
TO THE LAWYERS.

23:34.981 --> 23:38.651
IF YOU WANT,
WE'LL LEAVE IT
TO THE LAWYERS,

23:38.651 --> 23:40.720
BUT IT WAS
YOUR IDEA.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.457
I DIDN'T GO TO ONE
OF THOSE FANCY LAW SCHOOLS

23:44.457 --> 23:46.926
LIKE YOU DID,
MR. PIERPONT,

23:46.926 --> 23:50.663
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
EXPLAIN SOMETHIN' TO ME.

23:50.663 --> 23:54.066
HOW IN THE WORLD
DO YOU EXPECT MR. HARTOUNIAN

23:54.066 --> 23:57.069
TO VOLUNTARILY STOP
BUILDING ON THAT SITE

23:57.069 --> 24:00.139
AND MOVE THIS ENTIRE
HOUSING PROJECT SOMEWHERE ELSE?

24:00.139 --> 24:01.073
I DON'T SEE IT.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.610
BECAUSE, SIR, HE'LL
HAVE NO CHOICE.

24:03.610 --> 24:07.279
LET ME EXPLAIN HOW
THE LEGAL SYSTEM
REALLY WORKS.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.414
OK.

24:08.414 --> 24:09.916
YOU SEE, MR. BLUNT,

24:09.916 --> 24:13.085
IF YOUR CLIENT DOESN'T
VOLUNTARILY CEASE AND DESIST,

24:13.085 --> 24:16.589
WE'LL BE FORCED TO GO
THROUGH THE LONG, COSTLY PROCESS

24:16.589 --> 24:18.558
OF INJUNCTIONS,
LAWSUITS,

24:18.558 --> 24:20.392
MOTIONS,
COUNTERMOTIONS,

24:20.392 --> 24:22.294
HEARINGS, APPEALS--

24:22.294 --> 24:24.697
WHICH WILL COST
YOU SO MUCH

24:24.697 --> 24:27.700
IN TERMS OF LEGAL FEES
AND CONSTRUCTION DELAYS,

24:27.700 --> 24:30.770
YOU'LL WISH YOU'D
NEVER HEARD OF US.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.471
OOH.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.407
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
WE'LL LET YOU GUYS

24:35.407 --> 24:37.109
COME BARGING
INTO BUSHWOOD ESTATES

24:37.109 --> 24:40.479
AND THROW UP A LOT
OF CHEAP HOUSING.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.181
HA HA HA!

24:42.181 --> 24:45.417
WHICH ONE OF YOU IS
CHANDLER YOUNG'S SON?

24:45.417 --> 24:48.087
I AM.

24:48.087 --> 24:51.524
YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR
HOW YOUR LEGAL SYSTEM WORKS.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.726
NOW I'D LIKE
TO EXPLAIN

24:53.726 --> 24:55.995
ABOUT THE PETER
BLUNT SYSTEM.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.730
YOU SEE, UM...

24:57.730 --> 25:01.333
I DON'T GO IN
FOR LAWSUITS AND MOTIONS

25:01.333 --> 25:04.336
OR ANY OF
THAT LEGAL STUFF.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.739
NO, NO. SEE,
WHAT HAPPENS IS,

25:06.739 --> 25:09.141
I FIND OUT
WHERE YOU LIVE,

25:09.141 --> 25:12.344
AND THEN I COME
TO YOUR HOUSE, SEE?

25:12.344 --> 25:15.347
AND I BEAT DOWN
YOUR DOOR

25:15.347 --> 25:18.417
WITH A FUCKIN'
BASEBALL BAT!

25:18.417 --> 25:22.354
THEN I'M GONNA MAKE
A BONFIRE WITH
THE CHIPPENDALE,

25:22.354 --> 25:24.691
MAYBE ROAST
THAT GOLDEN RETRIEVER!

25:24.691 --> 25:27.459
ARF! ARF! ARF!
THEN EAT IT!

25:27.459 --> 25:29.762
THEN I'M COMIN'
UPSTAIRS, JUNIOR,

25:29.762 --> 25:32.899
AND I'M GONNA
GRAB YOU BY YOUR PJs!

25:32.899 --> 25:35.768
THEN I'M GONNA TAKE
YOUR BRAND-NEW BMW

25:35.768 --> 25:38.504
AND CRAM IT
UP YOUR TIGHT ASS!

25:38.504 --> 25:40.539
DO WE HAVE
AN UNDERSTANDING?

25:40.539 --> 25:42.975
[YELLING]

25:46.378 --> 25:48.380
SO, MARTHA,
IS HE IN?

25:48.380 --> 25:50.783
HE'S IN A MEETING.

25:50.783 --> 25:55.187
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE
BEFORE I HURT SOMEBODY!

25:57.657 --> 26:00.392
I TRIED TO
SWEET-TALK 'EM.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.928
SO I HEARD.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.931
WE CAN'T BUILD ANYTHING
ON BUSHWOOD ESTATES

26:04.931 --> 26:06.933
UNTIL WE GET A RULING
FROM THE COMMISSION.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.669
WE HAVE TO HAVE
A HEARING.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.071
A HEARING?
DO ME A FAVOR--

26:12.071 --> 26:14.674
DON'T TRY TO SWEET-TALK
THE PLANNING COMMISSION.

26:14.674 --> 26:18.410
JACK, HAVE A LITTLE
FAITH IN YOUR LAWYER.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.312
FAITH IN A LAWYER?

26:27.419 --> 26:29.288
THAT WAS GREAT,
DADDY.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.023
IT REALLY WAS,
MR. YOUNG.

26:31.023 --> 26:33.660
THANKS, KATE.
HE'S COMING ALONG NICELY.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.895
YOU KNOW, JUMPING
A FINE HORSE

26:35.895 --> 26:40.166
IS A BEAUTIFUL THING TO WATCH
WHEN IT'S DONE RIGHT.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.034
[NEIGH]

26:42.034 --> 26:43.435
SLOW DOWN!

26:43.435 --> 26:45.437
ELIZABETH,
WHERE'S THE BRAKES?

26:45.437 --> 26:47.439
NEXT TO
THE CLUTCH.

26:47.439 --> 26:50.643
EASY, DOG FOOD.
SON OF A BITCH!

26:50.643 --> 26:53.179
DON'T YOU EVER
MOVE THIS FAST!

26:53.179 --> 26:55.081
WHOA, DOG FOOD!

26:55.081 --> 26:56.315
DADDY.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.250
WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' HERE?

26:58.250 --> 27:00.152
I ASKED HIM.

27:00.152 --> 27:03.289
KATE, ELIZABETH.
ELIZABETH, MY DAUGHTER KATE.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.724
HAPPY TO MEET YOU.

27:04.724 --> 27:07.994
HELLO. I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE ON A HORSE.

27:07.994 --> 27:10.529
HE SAID HE'S BEEN
AROUND HORSES.

27:10.529 --> 27:12.598
BETTING ON THEM--
NOT RIDING.

27:12.598 --> 27:14.767
GENTLEMEN RIDE.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.602
NOT LIKE THAT.

27:16.602 --> 27:18.004
QUITE AN ENTRANCE.

27:18.004 --> 27:21.674
I WAS AFRAID YOU MIGHT
BREAK YOUR NECK

27:21.674 --> 27:22.942
OR YOUR ARM,

27:22.942 --> 27:26.012
MAYBE STRIKE YOUR HEAD
AGAINST A FENCE POST,

27:26.012 --> 27:28.948
MAYBE BE DRAGGED
SEVERAL MILES
OVER ROUGH TERRAIN.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.549
SWEET OF YOU TO CARE.

27:30.549 --> 27:33.619
OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE
NOT TROUBLED ABOUT
OUR LAWYERS' MEETING.

27:33.619 --> 27:35.888
NO, NOT AT ALL.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.157
CARE TO TAKE
A FEW JUMPS?

27:38.157 --> 27:41.293
I DON'T THINK
HE'S QUITE READY
FOR JUMPING.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.996
HOLD ON TIGHT.
GRIP WITH YOUR KNEES.

27:43.996 --> 27:47.033
LET THE ANIMAL
DO ALL THE WORK.

27:47.033 --> 27:50.402
SOUNDS LIKE
MY WEDDING NIGHT.

27:51.771 --> 27:54.741
[PFFFFFT!]

27:54.741 --> 27:56.943
YOUR HORSE HAS
A GAS PROBLEM.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.978
IT'S NOT THE HORSE.

27:58.978 --> 28:00.112
UGH!

28:00.112 --> 28:01.714
GAS PROBLEM.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.384
RAISE ALL THE JUMPS.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.119
YES, SIR.
YES, SIR.

28:13.793 --> 28:16.929
THIS IS CRAZY.
HE COULD REALLY GET HURT.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.065
ALMOST DEFINITELY,
I'D SAY.

28:19.065 --> 28:22.534
STAY BEHIND ME
AND DO AS I DO.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.070
GO!

28:26.072 --> 28:27.807
HA HA HA!

28:31.577 --> 28:32.678
YO!

28:32.678 --> 28:34.313
[NEIGH!]

28:36.148 --> 28:38.050
[PANTING]

28:41.287 --> 28:44.256
A LITTLE HIGHER
NEXT TIME. HIGHER!

28:46.358 --> 28:50.797
YOU MAY WANT TO URGE HIM
A LITTLE MORE, JACK.

28:53.632 --> 28:56.836
UP, PRINCE.

28:56.836 --> 29:00.239
THIS TIME, DOG FOOD,
OVER IT!

29:00.239 --> 29:02.775
[PANTING]

29:05.111 --> 29:06.212
AAH!

29:10.482 --> 29:12.251
[NEIGH]

29:13.986 --> 29:15.721
ONE MORE SET
OF JUMPS.

29:15.721 --> 29:18.424
WE'LL MAKE IT
AN EASY ONE.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.441
HAVING FUN YET, JACK?

29:35.441 --> 29:36.876
WHOA!

29:36.876 --> 29:39.211
HA HA HA!

29:39.211 --> 29:41.413
AAH!

29:41.413 --> 29:43.149
UHH!

29:43.149 --> 29:44.083
OH!

29:46.185 --> 29:47.353
AAH!

29:47.353 --> 29:48.220
[NEIGH]

29:48.220 --> 29:49.655
HA HA!

29:49.655 --> 29:52.391
[PFFFFFFT!]

29:56.295 --> 29:57.263
HA HA HA!

29:57.263 --> 29:59.131
HI-YO, DOG FOOD!

30:04.937 --> 30:06.538
GOOD EVENING, MISS.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.140
GOOD EVENING, SIR.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.077
POP, DADDY...

30:11.077 --> 30:13.946
DID YOU HAVE TO
WEAR THAT TUX?

30:13.946 --> 30:15.948
WHY? WHAT'S
WRONG WITH IT?

30:15.948 --> 30:17.683
IT'S...BLUE.

30:17.683 --> 30:20.252
IF YOU LOOK AT IT
THIS WAY--PURPLE.

30:20.252 --> 30:24.456
IF YOU LOOK AT IT
LIKE THIS--GOLD.
BEAUTIFUL, HUH?

30:24.456 --> 30:26.893
COME ON, SWEETHEART.

30:29.228 --> 30:31.964
PEOPLE HERE LIKE
THEIR TUXEDOS BLACK.

30:31.964 --> 30:34.967
THEY LIKE
THEIR NOSES RED,
THEIR BLOOD BLUE,

30:34.967 --> 30:37.970
THEIR FACES WHITE...
UNTIL THEY HIRE HELP.

30:37.970 --> 30:40.372
THEN SUDDENLY,
THEY WANT EVERY FACE

30:40.372 --> 30:42.975
TO BE BLACK,
BROWN, OR YELLOW.

30:42.975 --> 30:45.978
I'M NOT A HYPOCRITE
ENOUGH TO GO ALONG

30:45.978 --> 30:47.980
WITH A SCHEME LIKE THAT.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.983
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO CHANGE AT ONCE.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.985
I'M GONNA
INTRODUCE YOU

30:52.985 --> 30:55.387
TO THIS GUY
I REALLY LIKE,

30:55.387 --> 30:58.124
SO COULD YOU PRETEND
YOU LIKE EVERYONE?

30:58.124 --> 31:00.592
PRETEND? LISTEN,
I CAN'T PRETEND

31:00.592 --> 31:02.895
TO LIKE PEOPLE
I DON'T LIKE.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.997
WHY DO FUNZANOONS
IMPRESS YOU?

31:04.997 --> 31:06.598
WHAT'S
A FUNZANOON?

31:06.598 --> 31:10.269
SOMEONE WHO FARTS
IN THE BATHTUB
AND BITES THE BUBBLES.

31:10.269 --> 31:13.305
NICE. POP,
PLEASE, DON'T--

31:13.305 --> 31:16.742
GLAD YOU COULD COME.
THIS IS FOR YOU.

31:16.742 --> 31:18.544
HA HA! THAT'S
A FUNZANOON!

31:18.544 --> 31:22.281
THIS IS THE PERSON
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

31:22.281 --> 31:25.151
TODD, I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET MY FATHER.

31:25.151 --> 31:27.186
WHY DO YOU
LOOK FAMILIAR?

31:27.186 --> 31:29.721
BECAUSE I'M SUING YOU, SIR.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.190
NOTHING PERSONAL.

31:31.190 --> 31:34.860
YOU THINK YOUR HEAD GETTIN'
BUSTED MIGHT BE PERSONAL?

31:34.860 --> 31:36.162
HA HA HA!

31:36.162 --> 31:38.130
WHAT ABOUT
A BROKEN NOSE?

31:38.130 --> 31:41.333
JACK, HAVE
A PIG-IN-A-BLANKET.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.435
I LOVE
YOUR JACKET, JACK.

31:43.435 --> 31:46.505
TODD, NICE SEEING YOU.
KATE, IT'S A PLEASURE.

31:46.505 --> 31:47.173
THANKS.

31:47.173 --> 31:49.308
COME WITH ME, JACK.

31:49.308 --> 31:51.510
HE'S A VERY
FUNNY MAN.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.412
YEAH,
HE'S A RIOT.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.915
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.651
CHANDLER, YOU
WANT TO BUY A HORSE?

31:59.651 --> 32:02.054
HA HA HA HA!

32:02.054 --> 32:04.056
WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

32:04.056 --> 32:07.059
CYNTHIA, YOU MUST BE
HAPPY TO SEE ME.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.995
OF COURSE.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.602
HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

32:16.602 --> 32:19.671
LOOK AT THIS
CONVERSATION
I JUST HEARD.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.340
THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME

32:21.340 --> 32:23.742
SOMEONE ELSE GOT
THE COLD SHOULDER.

32:23.742 --> 32:26.178
I LIKE TO TALK
TO MYSELF.

32:26.178 --> 32:29.615
I LIKE DEALING
WITH A BETTER
CLASS OF PEOPLE.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.024
I LIKE THAT.

32:46.832 --> 32:48.834
DO YOU RUMBA,
SAMBA, MAMBO?

32:48.834 --> 32:50.702
I TRY TO TANGO.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.704
THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH.

33:12.558 --> 33:13.592
UHH.

33:15.727 --> 33:16.728
OH!

33:26.138 --> 33:28.774
MMM. YUM-YUM.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.483
MMM. HEE HEE HEE!

33:37.483 --> 33:39.551
KATE, WILL YOU
PLEASE LOOK

33:39.551 --> 33:43.289
AT YOUR FATHER
AND MY COUSIN
DANCING OUT THERE?

33:45.057 --> 33:47.326
EXCUSE ME.

33:49.628 --> 33:52.498
SL-U-U-U-U-URP!

34:00.706 --> 34:01.773
AHH.

34:07.779 --> 34:10.516
NO. UHH!

34:10.516 --> 34:13.851
NAH! EE! UH!

34:13.851 --> 34:15.721
YAH!

34:15.721 --> 34:17.289
AH!
AH!
AH!

34:42.348 --> 34:43.181
HA!

34:43.915 --> 34:45.083
AH!

34:45.083 --> 34:46.485
OH!

34:55.161 --> 34:58.096
BOY, THIS IS
A TOUGH ROOM.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.832
WELL, WHAT IS THAT?

35:04.236 --> 35:06.238
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

35:06.238 --> 35:10.242
OH! WELL...
I WAS JUST
PRACTICING.

35:10.242 --> 35:13.245
HOW CAN YOU TELL
WHERE THE BALL WENT?

35:13.245 --> 35:16.848
YOU CAN'T,
WHICH IS PROBABLY
WHY YOU DON'T SEE

35:16.848 --> 35:18.850
A LOT OF NIGHT GOLF.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.852
HOW'S THE PARTY GOIN'?

35:20.852 --> 35:21.987
OH...

35:21.987 --> 35:23.855
AH, I SEE.

35:23.855 --> 35:26.858
WAS IT, UH,
IS IT THAT BAD?

35:26.858 --> 35:29.661
HARRY, JUST BY
LOOKING AT ME,

35:29.661 --> 35:32.664
WOULD YOU SAY
THAT I WAS LOWER-CLASS,

35:32.664 --> 35:34.866
MIDDLE-CLASS,
OR UPPER-CLASS?

35:34.866 --> 35:36.602
YOU'RE BEING
SERIOUS?

35:36.602 --> 35:37.736
YES.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.871
YES. I WOULD SAY...

35:39.871 --> 35:42.474
MIDDLE...
UPPER, MAYBE.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.610
MIDDLE-UPPER,
DEFINITELY.

35:44.610 --> 35:47.479
SO WHAT ARE YOU--
I MEAN, AT HOME,

35:47.479 --> 35:49.215
WHEN YOU'RE
NOT CADDYING?

35:49.215 --> 35:52.351
AT HOME, WE HAPPEN
TO BE UPPER-LOWER,

35:52.351 --> 35:55.287
BUT AT SCHOOL,
I PRETEND I'M
LOWER-MIDDLE,

35:55.287 --> 35:58.324
BUT I ASPIRE
TO BECOME
MIDDLE-MIDDLE.

35:59.558 --> 36:02.394
YOU'RE OBSESSED WITH
THIS CLASS THING,
AREN'T YOU?

36:02.394 --> 36:05.096
I JUST WANT TO
FIT IN,

36:05.096 --> 36:07.499
BUT AROUND HERE,

01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:56.152
I DON'T LIKE YOU
THAT MUCH. 90-20.

01:10:56.152 --> 01:10:58.154
SWING NICE AND EASY.

01:10:58.154 --> 01:11:00.156
HIT ONE
DOWN THE FAIRWAY.

01:11:00.156 --> 01:11:03.159
JUST WANT TO SEE
HOW YOU HIT IT.

01:11:03.159 --> 01:11:06.162
TAKE YOUR TIME.
HIT IT NICE AND EASY.

01:11:06.162 --> 01:11:08.765
RIGHT DOWN THE FAIRWAY.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:09.999
RELAX. SWING EASY.

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:12.636
DON'T BE AFRAID.
ANYTIME.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.107
GIVE IT
A GOOD HIT

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.310
RIGHT DOWN
THE FAIRWAY.

01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:24.314
FELLAS?

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.518
HOLD IT.

01:11:28.518 --> 01:11:30.720
YOU'RE PICKIN'
YOUR HEAD UP...

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:31.521
[CRACK]

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:33.156
BEFORE YOU HIT.

01:11:33.156 --> 01:11:35.392
KEEP YOUR LEFT
ELBOW STRAIGHT.

01:11:35.392 --> 01:11:37.260
USE BOTH HANDS.

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:40.263
JUST BEND YOUR KNEES
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

01:11:40.263 --> 01:11:42.332
THAT'S IT.
JUST LIKE THAT.

01:11:42.332 --> 01:11:43.900
IT'S QUITE SIMPLE.

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:44.901
KEVIN.

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:46.302
HARRY.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:48.705
YOU'RE
CONFUSING THE MAN.
IT'S SIMPLE.

01:11:48.705 --> 01:11:52.809
GET RID OF
ALL THIS STUFF.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:55.745
YOU WANT TO
CLEAR YOUR MIND.

01:11:55.745 --> 01:11:57.347
OK. WATCH ME.

01:11:57.347 --> 01:12:00.350
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.521
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

01:12:05.555 --> 01:12:08.825
JUST BE THE BALL.

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:10.760
BE THE BALL.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.161
BE THE BALL.

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:14.163
BE THE BALL.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.165
NA NA NA NA...

01:12:16.165 --> 01:12:17.901

01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:19.836
NA NA NA NA...

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:21.771
NA NA NA NA...

01:12:21.771 --> 01:12:23.440
BE THE BALL.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.442
BE THE BALL.

01:12:25.442 --> 01:12:27.444
BE THE BALL.

01:12:27.444 --> 01:12:29.178
NO, NO, NO.

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.781

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:33.783

NO, NO, NO,
JACK, JACK, JACK!

01:12:40.457 --> 01:12:43.593
YOU'RE NOT
BEING THE BALL.
BE THE BALL.

01:12:43.593 --> 01:12:45.595
YOU BE THE BALL.

01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:48.598
IF I WANTED TO BE
SPORTS EQUIPMENT,

01:12:48.598 --> 01:12:51.401
I'D BE A LADIES'
BICYCLE SEAT.

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:55.605
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

01:12:55.605 --> 01:12:58.608
THE PROBLEM IS CONCENTRATION.

01:12:58.608 --> 01:13:01.344
WHY DON'T WE TRY IT
BLINDFOLDED?

01:13:01.344 --> 01:13:02.612
WHY NOT?

01:13:02.612 --> 01:13:04.414
LET'S TRY THAT.

01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:13.022
JACK, THE SPIRITUAL APPROACH
JUST DIDN'T WORK.

01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:15.625
THIS IS THE LATEST
BIOMECHANIC, ERGONOMIC,

01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:19.228
KINESTHETIC,
STATE OF THE ART
TEACHING TECHNIQUE.

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.230
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT.

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:23.833
GET RID OF THAT
WICKED SLICE.

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:25.435
LET'S TRY IT.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.440
OK. LET'S TRY ONE.

01:13:34.544 --> 01:13:36.846
IT'S GETTING BETTER.

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:42.018
AH!

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:43.920
PERFECT.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:00.403
GOOD MORNING,
MRS. ESTERHOUSE.

01:14:00.403 --> 01:14:03.272
DON'T "MRS. ESTERHOUSE"

01:14:08.678 --> 01:14:10.680
IN MY LINE OF WORK,

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.082
IT'S THE DETAILS
THAT KILL YOU.

01:14:13.082 --> 01:14:15.552
MAKE SURE THERE AREN'T
ANY SCREW-UPS.

01:14:15.552 --> 01:14:19.923
I DON'T INTEND
TO LOSE THIS GOLF MATCH.

01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:21.891
HA HA...HA HA!

01:14:21.891 --> 01:14:23.493
YOU WON'T.

01:14:33.036 --> 01:14:34.437
OK.

01:14:34.437 --> 01:14:37.306
THESE ARE SIX
MERCURY-FILLED,

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:40.577
STEEL-JACKETED
DUMDUM GOLF BALLS.

01:14:40.577 --> 01:14:44.247
FEEL THE WEIGHT
ON THIS LITTLE SWEETIE.

01:14:45.715 --> 01:14:48.718
THIS IS A HIGH TENSILE
STRENGTH TITANIUM DRIVER,

01:14:48.718 --> 01:14:52.121
WHICH IN THE HANDS
OF A PROPERLY TRAINED
PROFESSIONAL

01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:55.324
WILL DEFINITELY REDEFINE
THE TERM HANDICAP.

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:57.727
GO AHEAD.
LOOK IN THE EYEPIECE.

01:14:57.727 --> 01:15:00.163
GO AHEAD. FEEL FREE.

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:03.867
YOU SEE A WATERMELON
HANGING FROM THOSE GALLOWS?

01:15:03.867 --> 01:15:05.134
YES.

01:15:05.134 --> 01:15:08.137
LET'S JUST SAY THAT
THAT WATERMELON

01:15:08.137 --> 01:15:11.407
REPRESENTS THE HEAD
OF YOUR PROBLEM.

01:15:11.407 --> 01:15:13.543
OK.

01:15:14.744 --> 01:15:18.014
NOW, SIR,
IF YOU WOULD, PLEASE...

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:26.355
KEEP YOUR EYE
ON THE FRUIT.

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:29.358
KEEP YOUR EYE
ON THE FRUIT.

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:34.864
KEEP YOUR EYE
ON THE FRUIT.

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:39.235
GOOD.

01:15:39.235 --> 01:15:40.503
GOOD?

01:15:40.503 --> 01:15:41.771
GOOD?

01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:44.373
IT'S BETTER THAN GOOD.
IT'S GONE.

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:47.176
I WANT TO BE
VERY CLEAR ABOUT THIS.

01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:50.179
FOLLOW THE MATCH.
STAY OUT OF SIGHT.

01:15:50.179 --> 01:15:54.517
DO NOTHING
UNLESS YOU GET
A SIGNAL FROM ME.

01:15:54.517 --> 01:15:57.787
SHOULD MY OPPONENT
START TO WIN,

01:15:57.787 --> 01:16:00.189
I WILL TIP MY CAP.

01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:03.192
SPEAKING OF TIPPING,
THERE IS STILL MY FEE.

01:16:03.192 --> 01:16:05.929
I'D LIKE IT DEPOSITED
THERE, PLEASE.

01:16:05.929 --> 01:16:08.331
WHAT'S THIS?
SWISS BANK ACCOUNT?

01:16:08.331 --> 01:16:12.168
IT'S THE COMBINATION
OF MY BUS STATION LOCKER.

01:16:12.168 --> 01:16:14.904
HOW ELEGANT.

01:16:18.808 --> 01:16:22.478
I HOPE THIS IS
OUR LAST MEETING, MR. SANDERSON.

01:16:22.478 --> 01:16:26.482
MY SENTIMENTS EXACTLY,
MRS. ESTERHOUSE.

01:16:26.482 --> 01:16:30.019
[FANFARE PLAYS]

01:16:33.222 --> 01:16:39.829
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE.

01:16:39.829 --> 01:16:42.832
GENTLEMEN, THESE ARE
THE RULES OF THE MATCH.

01:16:42.832 --> 01:16:44.768
IT'S A SCOTCH TWOSOME.

01:16:44.768 --> 01:16:47.837
EACH PARTNER
HITS THE OTHER PARTNER'S BALL.

01:16:47.837 --> 01:16:51.708
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT
LIKE TAG TEAM WRESTLING.

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:53.777
ONLY YOU CAN'T DO THIS...

01:16:53.777 --> 01:16:56.212
NONE OF THIS...

01:16:56.212 --> 01:16:57.847
OR THIS.

01:16:57.847 --> 01:17:00.449
NOW, FEWEST STROKES
WINS THE HOLE.

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:03.319
MOST HOLES WINS THE MATCH.

01:17:03.319 --> 01:17:04.888
AUSTRALIAN WINTER RULES.

01:17:04.888 --> 01:17:07.256
IMPROVE YOUR LIE
IN THE ROUGH

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:10.459
IF YOU CAN ROUGHLY PROVE
YOU'RE NOT LYING.

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.862
GET YOUR BALL
IN THE WATER

01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:16.065
IF IT'S BEEN 45 MINUTES
SINCE YOU LAST ATE.

01:17:16.065 --> 01:17:20.236
THE PLAYER WITH
THE LARGEST SHOES HAS THE HONOR.

01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:23.006
ANYBODY BEAT A 12-D?

01:17:23.006 --> 01:17:25.775
I CAN, BUT I'M
OUT OF THIS.

01:17:25.775 --> 01:17:27.877
I GUESS YOU'RE UP.

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:29.813
MAY THE BEST MEN WIN.

01:17:29.813 --> 01:17:33.883
IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN,
I HOPE JACK AND HARRY WIN.

01:17:33.883 --> 01:17:37.120
WISH I COULD STAY,
BUT I GOT A THING.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.122
BYE.

01:17:39.122 --> 01:17:40.757
COME ON, HARRY.

01:17:40.757 --> 01:17:43.092
STRAIGHTEN UP.

01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:47.430
YAY!

01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:49.132
WOO!

01:17:51.801 --> 01:17:55.238
YOU'RE THE KIND
OF PARTNER TO HAVE.

01:17:55.238 --> 01:17:56.840
READY.

01:18:03.512 --> 01:18:06.115
THESE CLUBS
ARE TERRIBLE!

01:18:18.261 --> 01:18:19.695
ALL RIGHT.

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:22.665
I KNOW, I KNOW.
BE THE BALL.

01:18:22.665 --> 01:18:24.267
BE THE BALL.

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:27.871
SWING FOR THE FENCES!

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:30.539
IT'S SLICING!

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:33.142
STAY OUT
OF THE WOODS!

01:18:33.142 --> 01:18:34.110
HA HA HA!

01:18:34.110 --> 01:18:37.413
STAY OUT
OF THE WOODS!

01:18:37.413 --> 01:18:39.883
WAIT A MINUTE!
LOOK OUT!

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.286
AAH!

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:48.157
HA HA HA!

01:18:49.292 --> 01:18:51.961
MMM...MMM...

01:18:51.961 --> 01:18:53.963
UH-OH.
THERE'S MY OBJECTIVE.

01:18:53.963 --> 01:18:55.631
HE'S NO THREAT.

01:18:55.631 --> 01:18:57.700
NICE DUDS, THOUGH.

01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:00.569
SURE HATE
TO MESS 'EM UP.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:03.572
THIS IS GOING TO BE
AN EASY ONE.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.975
ONE QUICK STROKE,
I'LL BOUNCE HIM

01:19:05.975 --> 01:19:08.978
AND BE OUT OF HERE
BY SUNDOWN.

01:19:08.978 --> 01:19:12.148
EASIEST MONEY
I EVER MADE.

01:19:12.148 --> 01:19:14.984
HOW THE HELL
AM I SUPPOSED TO CONCENTRATE

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:17.486
WITH SMURF LIKE THAT
WALKING AROUND?

01:19:19.856 --> 01:19:22.025
YOU DID THAT
ON PURPOSE.

01:19:22.025 --> 01:19:24.393
NAUGHTY! NAUGHTY!

01:19:24.393 --> 01:19:28.597
I MAY HAVE TO PUT YOU
IN THE DUCK SUIT.

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:30.199
AHA!

01:19:30.199 --> 01:19:32.501
HEY! HEY!

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:34.603
WHO THE HELL
FOUND YOU?

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.772
YOU LITTLE
SUBVERSIVE VERMIN!

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:38.474
AH! OH!

01:19:38.474 --> 01:19:41.344
RRR...RRR...

01:19:41.344 --> 01:19:42.611
WOO! WOO! WOO!

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:44.413
LEGAL MATTER,
COMING THROUGH.

01:19:44.413 --> 01:19:47.951
YOU GETTIN' THE SHIT
KICKED OUT OF YOU?

01:19:47.951 --> 01:19:50.753
HA HA HA HA HA!

01:19:50.753 --> 01:19:52.822
HEY, JACK,
HOW'S IT GOING?

01:19:52.822 --> 01:19:55.892
TERRIBLE. I HAVE TO
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

01:19:55.892 --> 01:19:58.427
NO, I MEAN THE GAME.

01:19:58.427 --> 01:20:01.898
AH, WE'RE LOSING.
THEY'RE SIX HOLES AHEAD.

01:20:01.898 --> 01:20:06.369
I WAS STARTING
TO GET USED TO
COUNTRY CLUB LIFE.

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:12.041
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT?

01:20:12.041 --> 01:20:15.044
BUT THE GREEN
IS OVER THERE.

01:20:15.044 --> 01:20:19.048
YOU HAVE THE WORST SLICE
IN THE HISTORY OF GOLF.

01:20:19.048 --> 01:20:21.817
MIGHT AS WELL
GO WITH IT.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:25.521
LOOK OUT!
LOOK OUT!

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:39.936
HA HA!

01:20:39.936 --> 01:20:41.437
SEE THAT?

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:43.372
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

01:20:43.372 --> 01:20:47.176
AND I THOUGHT
THIS WAS A HARD GAME.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:48.477
UH-OH.

01:20:48.477 --> 01:20:52.748
I GOT YOU NOW,
YOU LITTLE FURRY FREAK.

01:20:52.748 --> 01:20:56.685
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
GET AWAY FROM ME.

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.821
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

01:20:58.821 --> 01:21:01.690
OH! TWINKIE!

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:04.560
HE'S CLOSE.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.695
YOU'RE CLOSE,
AREN'T YOU?

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:10.233
JUST A FEW FEET AWAY
MOCKING ME.

01:21:10.233 --> 01:21:15.438
AIN'T A GOPHER ALIVE
THAT'S A MATCH
FOR AN EX-MARINE.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:25.881
COME ON!
COME ON!

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:27.917
YAY!

01:21:29.718 --> 01:21:31.120
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.122
YOU WERE UP
SEVEN HOLES.

01:21:33.122 --> 01:21:35.124
HE'S WON
THE LAST SIX.

01:21:35.124 --> 01:21:38.928
HE CAN'T WIN
IF HE DOESN'T FINISH.

01:21:53.476 --> 01:21:54.743
YAAH!

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.012
AAH!
