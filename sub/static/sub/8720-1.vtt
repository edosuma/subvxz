- Yes, we are cunt-hair close.

They care about Ken Castle.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.793

05:43.218 --> 05:46.301
Okay, Bob.

05:46.722 --> 05:49.840
Castle has clocked exactly
one media appearance date:

05:50.267 --> 05:53.134
Walters' last interview before she died,
nine fucking years ago.

05:53.562 --> 05:57.055

06:24.551 --> 06:28.385

<i>a live “Worldlink Tonight" exclusive.</i>

06:38.815 --> 06:41.648
This motherfucker is off the charts!
- He could buy the network.

06:42.069 --> 06:47.280
Why would he? He pulls in 650 million

06:47.699 --> 06:52.193
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

06:53.413 --> 06:55.199

06:55.624 --> 06:57.615
<i>the ultimate sim environment,</i>

06:58.168 --> 07:02.162
<i>where players don't control virtual

<i>(Gina): The creation of

<i>Who is Castle? - (Gina):
"Society" took the world by storm,</i>

<i>becoming the number-one
guilty pleasure of billions.</i>

07:22.484 --> 07:26.569
<i>You can get paid to be controlled.
Or you can pay to control.</i>

07:26.988 --> 07:29.901
<i>(Gina): and generating

07:30.325 --> 07:33.488
<i>surpassing Bill Gates

07:36.039 --> 07:39.407
<i>(Gina): Nine months ago,
Castle unveiled a new simulation.</i>

07:39.835 --> 07:43.874
<i>One that would take gaming
to new heights of thrilling excess...</i>

07:45.215 --> 07:48.628
<i>and controversy.
- (Announcer): “Slayers.“</i>

07:49.136 --> 07:52.128
<i>(Gina:) "Slayers."
If "Society" let us live through others,</i>

07:52.556 --> 07:55.344
<i>“Slayers" would let us
die through others.</i>

07:55.767 --> 07:59.351
<i>“Slayers" gives the gamer full control
of a flesh-and-blood human being</i>

07:59.771 --> 08:02.763
<i>in full-scale, kill-or-be-killed combat.</i>

08:03.191 --> 08:08.152
<i>And when we say flesh and blood,
we mean flesh and blood.</i>

08:08.572 --> 08:11.109
(applauding)

08:17.747 --> 08:20.614
"Slayers."
- "Slayers." (chuckles)

08:21.042 --> 08:22.749
Why isn't it murder?

08:23.170 --> 08:26.037
When was the last time you saw
somebody volunteer to be murdered?

08:26.464 --> 08:29.752
Every slayer
is a bona fide death-row inmate,

08:30.177 --> 08:34.421
offered the chance to participate.
You survive 3O sessions,

08:34.847 --> 08:37.385
you get set free.
That's not a bad goddamned deal.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.269
And has any of them actually survived

08:42.688 --> 08:45.556
long enough to be set free?
- "Slayers" was put together

08:45.984 --> 08:49.067
with the full cooperation and approval
of the US government.

08:49.487 --> 08:53.355
The revenue it produces is responsible
for funding our prison system,

08:53.783 --> 08:58.152
keeping the bad guys behind bars.
The prop was voted for by a cock-solid

08:58.580 --> 09:01.163
68% of the American public.
- In an election tainted by

09:01.583 --> 09:04.951
suspected digital fraud.
Let's talk about the "genericons"

09:05.378 --> 09:09.087
sent into the "Slayers" environment
with a set of pre-programmed actions

09:09.507 --> 09:13.751
with no one controlling them.
Chances of survival are next to nil.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.887
Plenty of prisoners
could never cut it as slayers.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.470
Shouldn't they be given the same chance?
To roll the dice for a ticket out?

09:20.894 --> 09:25.183
Besides, they only need to survive
one session. - Right.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.560
Mr. Castle, how does it work?

09:28.109 --> 09:31.568
It begins with a single nanocell planted
in the motor cortex of the brain.

09:33.949 --> 09:38.489
This cell replicates, replacing
the cells around it with perfect copies.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.745
These copied cells contain
remote-access functionality.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.203
Nano plus cortex equals nanex.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.244
Isn't it true that every human
that undergoes this procedure

09:48.672 --> 09:51.664
will have a distinct IF' address,
like a mobile device

09:52.092 --> 09:54.504
or a notebook?
- Similar, but control

09:54.928 --> 09:57.545
is localized to the parameters
of our gaming environments.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.714
You take "Society," for instance.

10:00.225 --> 10:03.013
Once a cast member has left
the workplace, they are free

10:03.436 --> 10:07.100
from the control and monitoring
of their player. - Oh, that's a relief.

10:07.524 --> 10:10.357
To some, maybe. To some.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.279
Don't you think a good many folks
wouldn't mind a bit of control.

10:19.703 --> 10:23.867
Uh - Someone else making
all the decisions for you?

10:24.499 --> 10:27.867
No tough choices, no responsibilities.

10:29.796 --> 10:34.711
Think about it.
- We will, Mr. Castle. We will.

10:35.135 --> 10:38.298
<i>(applauding) - (Announcer): The “Gina

Mr. Castle,
we can't stop every virus

11:35.945 --> 11:38.687

Yeah, yeah. Tillsman, Tillsman.

13:23.011 --> 13:27.847

13:28.850 --> 13:31.968
Always sitting and looking.
Just looking and sitting.

13:32.395 --> 13:36.229
Just like me. I keep my holes down.
You gotta keep them down.

13:37.025 --> 13:40.438
Every day a dude inevitably snaps,
breaks,

We don't know if we'll live or die.

13:46.534 --> 13:50.698
Everybody but you. Right? 27 battles.

13:51.122 --> 13:54.831
Three to go.
No one's ever come that close.

13:55.251 --> 13:59.040
No one's even gotten 1O games without
getting shot. Everybody but Kable.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.380
Kable, Kable,
because he's sitting and looking.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.667
You got a plan in your head.
You got a mission.

14:06.095 --> 14:09.929
You never break, you never snap.
You never say shit either.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.808
But you take care
of your business, don't you?

14:13.228 --> 14:15.970
Niggas get spooked

20:50.207 --> 20:52.790

- (beeps)

21:40.633 --> 21:43.500

21:44.053 --> 21:46.135

21:54.855 --> 21:56.937

22:08.619 --> 22:10.781

22:39.358 --> 22:40.860

23:13.768 --> 23:16.886

23:28.282 --> 23:29.317

23:40.878 --> 23:42.164

23:53.474 --> 23:55.090
Bastard!

24:15.955 --> 24:18.071

24:23.212 --> 24:25.374
(cheering loudly)
- Fuck! Yeah!

24:27.091 --> 24:28.172
Yeah!

24:44.358 --> 24:46.474
We're all gonna die.

24:49.530 --> 24:53.239
(gasping) on my God.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.156
Let me out of here!

24:58.622 --> 25:01.614
I'm not supposed to be in here!

25:02.459 --> 25:04.951
Who are they?

25:05.379 --> 25:07.461
Who the fuck are they?

25:09.300 --> 25:11.587
Who the fuck is playing us?

25:21.854 --> 25:23.310
(high-pitched whine)

25:23.731 --> 25:25.813
Shut up, fish.

25:52.593 --> 25:57.303
Gay. Gay. Gay. Retardedly gay...

25:58.224 --> 25:59.555
<i>Swarmers. ..
(Computer): Swarmers,</i>

25:59.975 --> 26:03.058
<i>the latest innovation from Browning.
This self-detonating cartridge</i>

26:03.479 --> 26:06.892
<i>offers the deadliest spray available
from a full-tracking, cornering ordnance</i>

26:07.316 --> 26:11.776
Daddy like. - Simon!
- Fangirl, stop hacking me.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.904
<i>You suck. You'll kill
my boyfriend before he gets out of jail</i>

26:15.324 --> 26:17.531
<i>to fill me up with his hot seed.
- Simon...</i>

26:17.952 --> 26:22.116
<i>I just wanna play you. Forget about
that star-sucker. - Shut up!</i>

26:22.539 --> 26:25.372
<i>When am I gonna meet you for real?</i>

26:25.793 --> 26:27.249
What's that?

26:28.254 --> 26:32.498
<i>What's up, loser? Mom says
go to college, move the fuck out,</i>

26:32.925 --> 26:36.168
<i>and you're a sick retard.
You smell like Jeffrey Dahmer.</i>

26:36.595 --> 26:40.429
Wanna make <i>out?</i> - <i>I can't wait
till they cut you off.</i> - <i>Eat balls.</i>

26:40.849 --> 26:44.387
<i>Simon? - Maybe.
- Oh my God. It's really you.</i>

26:44.812 --> 26:47.554
<i>Nice.
- Do you want to see our tits?</i>

26:47.982 --> 26:51.145
<i>Yes,</i> I <i>do.</i>
- <i>Now that we have your attention,</i>

26:51.568 --> 26:53.946
<i>here's an offer that you can't refuse.
- Here we go.</i>

26:54.363 --> 26:59.233
<i>5O million Euros for control of Kable.
Instant transfer to your account.</i>

26:59.702 --> 27:03.821
Kable's not for sale.
- <i>Baby,</i> make <i>it</i> 100.

27:04.248 --> 27:06.080
It's been real.

27:06.500 --> 27:10.710
(buzzing, whirring)

27:12.214 --> 27:14.581
What the fuck?
- (gunshot)

27:18.929 --> 27:20.340
(gunshot)

27:24.601 --> 27:27.389
<i>(Woman): If you want to talk to Kable,
we can show you how.</i>

27:27.855 --> 27:30.597
<i>If you want to talk to Kable,
we can show you how.</i>

27:31.025 --> 27:35.440
<i>If you want to talk to Kable,
we can show you how.</i>

27:37.656 --> 27:41.365
Look at the new face of "Slayers."
Pure, crystallized horror.

27:41.785 --> 27:46.495
Two stories high and bathed
in bloody red. He is what they want.

27:46.915 --> 27:52.285
They love Kable. - They do now. But when
they watch him die in front of them,

27:52.713 --> 27:57.207
so sharp and vivid, like you could
reach out and touch the wet flesh,

27:57.801 --> 28:01.795
they're gonna change their view.
They'll be seduced by the power,

28:02.222 --> 28:04.088
the violence, the dominance.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.429
It's human nature.
- Kable's made it through 28 battles.

28:07.853 --> 28:11.471
Every player is trying to take him out.
- He's a perfect soldier,

28:11.899 --> 28:13.606
a tactical killing computer.

28:14.026 --> 28:18.145
His only vulnerability
is the nanex itself. The ping!

28:19.073 --> 28:23.237
The delay between Simon's commands
and Kable's ability to execute.

28:23.660 --> 28:26.368
Why should this one be any different?

28:26.789 --> 28:28.871
Who controls him?

28:32.711 --> 28:33.746
No one.

28:34.129 --> 28:37.463
(growling)

28:42.471 --> 28:44.007
(screaming)

28:45.432 --> 28:47.264
Get it out of me!

29:08.247 --> 29:11.990
What happened to this one?
- Looks like he escaped.

29:13.043 --> 29:14.249
(laughs)

29:16.672 --> 29:18.754
All right, girls,

29:19.174 --> 29:21.461
back to your jazzercise.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.764
(neck cracking)

29:30.894 --> 29:34.182
That's Hackman, Hackman, Hackman.

29:34.606 --> 29:38.224
He killed a whole mess of people,
all kinds of people.

29:39.111 --> 29:43.856
One day he just turns himself in,
like he wants to be inside,

29:44.283 --> 29:47.446
or some crazy shit like that.
You know what I'm saying.

29:48.370 --> 29:52.455
There'll always be slayers, as long
as they got motherfuckers like that.

29:52.875 --> 29:55.617
Kable! Let's go. Upgrades, come on.

30:00.591 --> 30:02.753
Why don't you upgrade me?
- Shut the fuck up!

30:08.474 --> 30:11.057
You shut the fuck up.
You shut the fuck up.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.559
Fucking shut the fuck up.

30:15.397 --> 30:18.515
(explosions)

30:25.824 --> 30:29.533
(beeping, whirring)

30:41.590 --> 30:47.085
Who aims? - What?
- The player or the slayer?

30:51.600 --> 30:56.845
I'm the hand.
Someone somewhere else is the eye.

30:57.606 --> 31:02.351
That's tripped out.
- Sometimes they take over

31:02.778 --> 31:07.523
completely.
They move you around like a robot.

31:07.950 --> 31:10.783
That don't work so good.
- Why?

31:11.578 --> 31:13.194
The delay.

31:13.622 --> 31:16.284
Yeah, the ping. They talk about that.

31:16.708 --> 31:20.076
How long it takes the slayer
to respond to the command.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.041
Whatever they call it,

31:23.465 --> 31:25.923
the slice of a second out there

31:26.343 --> 31:30.257
is the difference between living
and dying. When that trigger pulls...

31:31.557 --> 31:34.675
(gunshots)

31:36.687 --> 31:38.894
...it's just me.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.617
Hey, Kable!

32:03.338 --> 32:04.840
Look“.

32:06.091 --> 32:08.173
I just killed someone.

32:09.678 --> 32:12.545
This is the blood.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.306
Look.

32:18.979 --> 32:20.936
He's back here.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.438
Want to see?

32:25.152 --> 32:27.063
Your head ain't on straight.

32:28.155 --> 32:31.864
(neck cracks)
- (groans)

32:32.284 --> 32:34.992
I'm gonna kill you too, on Sunday.

32:35.454 --> 32:40.790
Probably. - That's why
they put me here. I've got no strings.

32:41.501 --> 32:45.665
<i>I've got no strings, so I have fun.</i>

32:46.715 --> 32:49.582
<i>I'm not tied up to anyone.</i>

32:51.011 --> 32:54.970
<i>They've got strings, but you can see</i>

32:56.558 --> 32:58.299
<i>there are no strings</i>

32:58.727 --> 33:00.217
<i>on me.</i>

33:01.229 --> 33:03.391
You got two whores, Kable.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.603
The fuck you say?
- On the outside.

33:07.944 --> 33:11.482
I'm sorry,
I meant your pretty girls.

33:13.450 --> 33:16.192
You wanna get back to them,

33:17.204 --> 33:19.741
but I'm gonna visit them first.

33:28.465 --> 33:30.456
(beeping)

33:30.884 --> 33:31.464
All right.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.342
(Simon): Kable?

33:42.187 --> 33:44.975
Kable, dude? It's me.

33:45.399 --> 33:47.060
It's me.
- Who?

33:47.609 --> 33:50.522
Simon. I'm playing you.

33:51.196 --> 33:54.234
How come I can hear you?
- Well, it's a mod.

33:55.367 --> 33:58.610
Gamers can't talk to cons.
- I know.

33:59.037 --> 34:02.029
It's fucking unbelievable.
This is amazing.

34:04.960 --> 34:05.995
(gunfire)

34:20.308 --> 34:24.016
It's cool, yeah?
- No, it's not cool.

34:24.813 --> 34:27.976
Pay attention
to the fucking game.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.735
(Simon): All right, I got it.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.277
What are you? 12?
- I'm 17 actually. Thank you.

34:44.291 --> 34:45.577
(screams)

34:48.587 --> 34:52.455
This is unbelievable.
How am I not dead yet?

34:53.216 --> 34:55.331
Cause I'm a badass motherfucker.

34:57.471 --> 34:59.212
(man groans)

35:09.316 --> 35:10.351
Shit.

35:11.359 --> 35:13.191
I'm making my cut, gonna scatter.

35:16.615 --> 35:22.327
Freek, you shouldn't be here!
- I wanna put down. I wanna rock.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.071
I'm gonna make it.

35:42.015 --> 35:45.133
Gibs. - What?
- Like giblets, kibbles and bits,

35:45.560 --> 35:48.643
chunks, pieces everywhere.
- These are real humans!

They had it coming anyway. - (screams)

36:15.632 --> 36:19.967
That goes for me, too.
- (Simon): Yeah, but you're different.

36:20.720 --> 36:24.554
Different? How?
- Because you're my psycho.

36:25.767 --> 36:28.225
Damn, new area.

36:34.150 --> 36:37.393
Think about it, Kable.
All the shit we've been through.

36:37.821 --> 36:42.031
What an epic run.
It's gonna suck to see it end.

36:42.450 --> 36:46.284
Are you fucking kidding me?
- I get that for you it's different.

36:51.251 --> 36:53.333
This way.

36:55.797 --> 36:58.755
There's nothing there.
- Trust me. - It's a restricted area.

36:59.175 --> 37:02.668
It's beyond the borders of the game.
I can't put you there.

37:03.096 --> 37:05.258

37:52.354 --> 37:54.391
I'm right here. I can hear you.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.225
Listen to me.

37:57.275 --> 38:01.735
I don't know who's behind it or why,
but I was supposed to die tonight.

38:02.155 --> 38:05.944
They're gunning for us. I can beat them,

38:06.368 --> 38:09.781
but not with you controlling me.
- What are you talking about?

38:10.205 --> 38:14.449
Turn me loose, kid.
You wanna win, turn me loose. - I can't.

38:14.876 --> 38:15.911
Find a way!

38:18.129 --> 38:19.665
Bastard.

38:26.805 --> 38:30.890
Miss Roth, you're applying
for custody of your daughter...

38:31.309 --> 38:34.176
Delia, her name is Delia.

38:34.604 --> 38:38.598
Spouse incarcerated, without possibility
of parole. You use your maiden name?

38:39.275 --> 38:43.769
Uh-huh. Urn... My husband, he's...

38:44.197 --> 38:48.942
It's not entirely true, regarding his
sentence. He's due to be released soon.

38:49.327 --> 38:54.163
Miss Roth, your husband
was charged and... (laughs)

38:55.458 --> 38:59.292
He was convicted of first-degree murder.
I hardly consider

39:00.171 --> 39:04.005
his release, if it were to happen
at all, to be a good thing.

39:07.804 --> 39:09.841
So it says you're an actor?

39:12.183 --> 39:16.427
I haven't seen you in anything.
- I work in "Society."

39:17.647 --> 39:19.354
It's a job.
- Miss Roth,

39:19.774 --> 39:24.189
your child has been well placed.
The new family is very wealthy.

39:24.612 --> 39:29.527
I can understand that you love her,
probably very much.

39:29.951 --> 39:33.990
But do you really think
that she would be better off with

39:34.414 --> 39:36.030
people like you?

39:38.251 --> 39:42.040
Yes, I do. I'm her mother.

39:45.341 --> 39:49.630
We will give your application all the
consideration it merits. - (buzzer)

<i>that goes on inside the so-called game.</i>

40:47.737 --> 40:52.356
Kable said we got lucky that they were
gunning for us. What's that all about?

40:52.826 --> 40:57.115
<i>Kable got a past. He knows things
he don't even know he knows.</i>

40:57.539 --> 41:00.156
<i>What 'Mugs'?
- Things that Castle's afraid of.</i>

41:00.583 --> 41:04.497
<i>As long as your boy stays on the inside,
Castle can keep him quiet.</i>

41:04.879 --> 41:08.463
<i>But if he ever got out...
Castle would never let that happen.</i>

41:08.883 --> 41:12.592
There's one battle left.
I can handle my own bidness, thank you.

<i>You're not hearing me.
This is not something you can control.</i>

42:30.006 --> 42:33.169
I don't have any.
- Listen to me.

42:33.593 --> 42:36.881
Simon's gonna give you what you want.

42:40.558 --> 42:43.596
How do you know that?
- I know something else.

42:44.020 --> 42:48.514
Whether or not he's controlling you,
you'll never reach the save point.

42:48.942 --> 42:51.149
Castle won't allow it.
- We'll see.

42:51.569 --> 42:57.155
No! You have to escape.
Your wife and your daughter need you.

42:57.575 --> 43:02.615
If you wanna get out and see them,
you'll have to find another way.

43:06.876 --> 43:11.791
I need you to give me something.
- What, Tillman?

43:13.883 --> 43:15.965
Drunk.

43:59.554 --> 44:03.297
<i>(Man): What have you got there?
Kable, what the hell is that?</i>

44:11.983 --> 44:13.974
<i>Put it down!</i>

44:14.861 --> 44:17.023
<i>Put it down!</i>

44:19.866 --> 44:22.904
<i>Fuckface, throw the bottle in the trash!</i>

44:23.328 --> 44:24.193
(shatters)

44:29.042 --> 44:31.158
(panting)

44:43.639 --> 44:46.848
(Simon): It was a great idea
turning you loose.

44:56.652 --> 45:00.270
(Kable): What happened?
- You wanted control. You got it.

45:02.408 --> 45:03.239
(screams)

45:06.287 --> 45:08.369
(gunfire)
- (screams)

45:13.294 --> 45:15.911
What's the matter with you, Kable?
Kill something!

45:41.823 --> 45:44.030
This is unbelievable. Kable,

45:44.450 --> 45:47.238
listen. This is the last game.
You're gonna end up dead

45:47.662 --> 45:51.621
and I'm gonna look like an asshole
if you don't pull your balls together.

45:52.083 --> 45:54.165
(gunfire)

45:55.795 --> 45:56.830
(Simon): Damn it!

45:58.297 --> 46:02.211

46:24.031 --> 46:26.523
Kable, what the hell are you doing?

46:33.082 --> 46:35.494
Oh, what the hell?

46:37.795 --> 46:39.126
That's just gross.

47:10.828 --> 47:14.742
Go, go, go! - Anything else,
you fucking cheerleader?

47:16.250 --> 47:17.627

47:20.630 --> 47:23.372
(laughing)

47:30.097 --> 47:31.713
Motherfucker!

47:46.906 --> 47:50.319
Kable, I beg you.
Get back in the game.

47:50.743 --> 47:52.245
You're screwing my ass here.

47:59.335 --> 48:03.420
<i>(Woman): This is a restricted area.

50:24.105 --> 50:25.595
Oh, oh.

50:26.023 --> 50:29.186
You have a question?
He left a wife on the outside, right?

50:29.610 --> 50:32.102
Tillman? Yeah.
- Find her.

50:42.123 --> 50:45.081

She's not home. But Castle's
personal security will be soon enough.

51:43.267 --> 51:46.760
Trust me, you don't wanna meet them.
- Who are you?

51:47.688 --> 51:49.554
You asked me that once before.

51:50.900 --> 51:55.440
Your voice...
- You should come with me. Like now!

(Man #1): That's why you're fool.
That's what I'm talking about.

52:56.006 --> 52:59.590
Exactly. - (Man #2): Stop it with that.
Freaky off-the-rails shit?

53:00.344 --> 53:03.462
(Man #1): That's why it's a game
of deception. - (puck clacking)

53:06.517 --> 53:10.226
(Man #2): Yeah!
- That's bullshit.

53:11.230 --> 53:13.892
You're the ones who broke me out?
- We only freed your mind.

53:14.316 --> 53:17.900
And your ass followed.
- Holy shit, you made it.

53:18.362 --> 53:21.024
You're really here. Kable...

53:22.491 --> 53:24.073
You're great.

53:26.161 --> 53:29.290
You got questions.
- A few.

53:29.957 --> 53:32.415
She took my blood. Why?

53:32.835 --> 53:37.079
The nanex, it modifies
the actual cell structure of the brain.

53:37.506 --> 53:41.420
We can crack it,
but we need your DNA

53:41.844 --> 53:45.428
to generate custom code.
- All right. Why me?

53:45.848 --> 53:48.135
Castle's afraid of you.
- It ain'tjust a game.

53:48.559 --> 53:49.970
More people are stepping forward,

53:50.394 --> 53:53.762
wanna be a part of Castle's world
and forget about being human.

53:54.189 --> 53:58.433
Right now it's the desperate ones:
convicts, addicts, the sick, the poor.

53:58.861 --> 54:02.274
The ones that fell through the cracks.
- The prison system is out of control,

54:02.698 --> 54:05.565
set to bankrupt the whole USA.
Castle rides in

54:05.993 --> 54:09.577
on a white horse, says he has a plan,
and we just fall in line.

54:09.997 --> 54:14.457
The healthcare system is collapsing.
- Control over genetic disease,

54:14.877 --> 54:18.666
birth defects no longer an issue,
all we gotta do is exchange our cells.

54:19.089 --> 54:22.923
Promise of a longer life.
You think people will refuse? - No.

54:23.344 --> 54:25.802
Then the next thing you know...

54:26.805 --> 54:28.716
We're all slaves.

54:30.601 --> 54:32.683
I can't help you.

You'd just got Kable through his 10th

an I-con could last that long.

King player. - Good times.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:52.391
Sure, on the outside.
Now look at these.

01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:59.853
That's what it's like on the inside.
How long would you last?

01:03:00.986 --> 01:03:02.476
You know, Simon,

01:03:02.863 --> 01:03:06.982
you're suspected in aiding the escape
of a convicted

01:03:07.409 --> 01:03:10.947
murderer
from a maximum security penitentiary.

01:03:11.371 --> 01:03:13.738
These charges are beyond serious.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:20.085
Your hard drives have been seized.
Forensics is decrypting the contents.

01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:23.714
Your internet activity
over the last 1O years is being

01:03:24.176 --> 01:03:26.918
scrutinized and catalogued...

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:30.212
in minute, vivid detail.

01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:33.890
In addition, your father's bank accounts
have been frozen

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:36.769
pending further investigation.

01:03:37.189 --> 01:03:40.477
It was his money
that funded Tillman's escape.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:46.319
Tell me everything that happened
leading up to yesterday afternoon.

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:49.948
Everybody you talked to,
everything you saw,

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:56.364

Tell me that right now!

01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:58.452
Yeah, urn...

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:01.702
I'm gonna need something, too.

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:07.299
Oh, really?
What might that be?

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:13.051
Could you guys do a sandwich,
like peanut butter,

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:16.718
almond butter, walnut butter,
pecan butter,

01:04:17.145 --> 01:04:19.352
pistachio butter...

01:04:20.315 --> 01:04:23.524
Pretty much any kind of nut butter

01:04:23.944 --> 01:04:25.355
with some grape jelly.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:31.941
Pistachio butter? They make that?

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:33.575
It's awesome.

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:52.128
(Kable): Now what? - We'll put
the DNA into the soup, light it up,

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:56.720
extract it, feed my girl's sequence
into the code and we are good to go.

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:59.555
An anti-spyware program.
- Basically.

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:04.565
You can't quarantine the cells, but we
can disable their ability to transmit.

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:09.736
I'd make you cut it out. - That would be
like cutting out your brain.

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:14.491
The nanocells replace the cells
they replicate. They become you.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:18.404
We gonna keep her sedated
until we can kill the link.

01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:22.788
Otherwise, she's broadcasting everything
she sees or hears. - 3O minutes.

01:05:23.211 --> 01:05:27.375
You give us a robot,
we give you back a super-hot human.

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:28.834
Tillman,

01:05:29.843 --> 01:05:33.427
we need to talk.
- So talk.

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:35.383
Come on.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.852
They tested it on soldiers.

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:48.893
The first volunteer
was a Corporal Travis Scotch.

01:05:49.321 --> 01:05:51.358
A friend of yours, I believe.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:53.692
And the second was you.

01:05:57.871 --> 01:06:00.829
The idea was to replace your brain.

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:03.707
Bit by bit, cell by cell.

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:08.086
The new tissue would never break down,
never deteriorate.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:11.878
A new era in human longevity,
that's what they told us.

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:15.761
Nine weeks later, Scotch was dead
and you were serving life in maximum.

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:18.008
Castle's project was shut down,

01:06:18.433 --> 01:06:22.597
but the same technology
resurfaced within a year in a game.

01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:25.934
Castle called it "Society."
Tillman, listen:

01:06:26.358 --> 01:06:28.395
Whatever happened in that project,
it's something Castle wanted buried.

01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:30.479
We need that shit,

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:35.319
what you saw, what you know.
- I don't know what to tell you.

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:39.322
You ain't gotta tell me shit.
I want you to show me.

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:46.454
(Trace): We're ready to rock.
Let's cut the link in three,

01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:48.960
two, one.

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:52.839
(snorts)

01:06:55.095 --> 01:06:57.177
(creaking)

01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:00.676
Who's there?

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:07.516
What are you doing here?

01:07:09.401 --> 01:07:11.893
Who are you?
- Tech support.

01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:26.536
What are we looking at?
- His memories.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:30.749
Translated into audio-visual data.
- I read something about this.

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:33.914
That tech's not supposed
to be available for another decade.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:37.384
They'll have better shit than this
at best buy in 18 months.

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:49.267
Oh, son of a bitch. John Tillman.

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:54.936
I never thought I would be so happy
to see your ugly face. - Scotch!

01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:57.445
Scotch.

01:07:58.658 --> 01:08:01.992
<i>(Scotch): Is it me, or does this place
fucking suck?</i>

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:05.245
<i>They got me hooked up
to computers five hours a day,</i>

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.949
feeding me vitamins and pills
and God knows what,

01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:11.835
giving me injections,
taking and giving me blood...

01:08:12.255 --> 01:08:16.122
These nurses are wiping my ass.
And male nurses, too.

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:21.883
I can't believe I let you talk me into
this. I'm having these blackouts.

01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:26.517
They're scaring the shit out of me.
I don't know how long I've been here.

01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:30.136
Hey, man!

01:08:30.564 --> 01:08:31.805
<i>(Static)</i>

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:36.477
<i>(Scotch): Are they letting you out,
you son of a bitch?</i>

01:08:37.906 --> 01:08:42.524
I'm not getting out.
- Okay.

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:48.497
John, you good?

01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:52.960
I'm fine.
- Man, you don't look fine.

01:08:55.298 --> 01:08:57.585
I'm sorry.
- Yeah, that's okay.

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:03.803
It's not like you ever looked
that good in the first place.

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:12.680
What's the gun for, John?
- (Gina): What's happening?

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:14.142
Shh!

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:18.185
You're scaring me. What's the gun for?
- I can't...

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:20.899
I can't stop this.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:24.658
Stop what? What did they do to you?
- (groaning)

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:28.662
John. Stop it. You're scaring me.
- I'm sorry, Scotch.

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:31.993
John, don't. No, John, stop!

01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:39.042
(breathing heavily)

01:09:44.264 --> 01:09:47.506
Not the best commercial for Castle.
- (Trace): He made him do it.

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:50.971
Castle made him do it.
(Man): It was a test. - Cha-ching.

01:09:51.395 --> 01:09:54.980
Excuse me, media whore,
this isn'tjust a story.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.641
The world is splitting down.
Sooner or later,

01:09:58.069 --> 01:10:01.562
everyone will have to take a side,
even scavengers like you. - Urn...

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:42.648
It's you.

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:54.123
I missed you so much.
You're the reason I held on.

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:03.340
I love you.
- Where's our daughter?

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:12.758
I couldn't stop them. I'm sorry.
- Nobody could.

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:16.394
The foster parent paid good money
to remain anonymous,

01:11:16.814 --> 01:11:20.398
but there's always a data trail.
- Where is she?

01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:23.776
I'm sorry, Tillman. She's with Castle.

01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:33.412
(motorcycle revving)
- (crowd chattering)

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:41.544
Tillman!

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:46.625
That's all the story you're gonna get.

01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:02.015
<i>(Man): Silverton, get up!</i>

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:05.902
(groans) What's up? What's going on?

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:10.532
<i>(Man): Looks like someone decided
you're no longer a threat.</i>

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:22.581
<i>(Computer):
You're a cheater. You're a cheater.</i>

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:26.590
<i>You're a cheater. You're a cheater.</i>

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:39.477
We'll find him.

01:12:40.815 --> 01:12:44.399
Don't worry. He'll come to us.

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.082

01:13:46.214 --> 01:13:48.706

01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:05.772
<i>The latest and greatest.

You're awesome!
- Castle. - Kable.

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:46.221
I don't care about you.
- You just want your little sugarpie.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:49.936
So don't do anything stupid.
My house, my rules.

01:16:51.232 --> 01:16:53.599
Come on, I wanna show you something.

01:16:59.031 --> 01:17:02.023
(sighs) Thank you
for leading me to them, by the way.

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.783
The Humanz's cell, that is.

01:17:06.163 --> 01:17:09.622
Sooner or later, they'd be
whistling my tune like everybody else.

01:17:10.042 --> 01:17:14.206
Their little cracker program
got my attention. A genuine nuisance,

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:17.839
no doubt about it.
One thing even they didn't know though,

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:20.378
I'm wired too.

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:25.092
I replaced 98% of my own noodle
with nano-tissue years ago.

01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:28.304
But mine's different.
It's built to send...

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:31.306
(imitates computer beeping)

01:17:31.731 --> 01:17:34.223
...to transmit.
Whereas every other nanocell,

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:39.645
including the ones in your head,
Kable, are designed to receive.

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:42.780
I think it and you do it.

01:17:45.077 --> 01:17:47.159
(laughing)

01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:55.161
We're talking every slayer, everyone
in Society City. Your better half

01:17:55.588 --> 01:17:59.081
falls into that category, if they
are within range of my transmitters.

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:01.090
Very nice, Castle.

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:05.174
So you've got an army of psychotics
to dance around for you.

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:09.683
You're thinking small, Kable.
But not as small as me.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:15.681
Nanocell are real small. A 1000 times
smaller than these dust particulates.

01:18:16.734 --> 01:18:19.396
(inhaling) You inhale it,
they go to work, replicating,

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:22.938
spreading like a virus,
multiplying in exponentials.

01:18:23.366 --> 01:18:26.779
In 6 months' time, I could have
100 million people converted.

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:30.571
Ditch diggers, porn stars and
presidents. Not one would be the wiser.

01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:33.831
100 million people who'll buy
what I want them to buy

01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:36.743
and vote how I want them to vote.

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:41.544
Do pretty much anything
I figure they ought to do. For instance:

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:46.799
(roaring)

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:49.180
(bone snapping)
- (screaming)

01:19:19.046 --> 01:19:23.335
You should've let him fight for himself.
Maybe he would've had a shot.

01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:26.342
You're missing the point.
- No, I get it.

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:28.673
You're pulling the strings.

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:32.932
Which makes my next move
pretty stupid. (grunting)

01:19:33.644 --> 01:19:37.103
My smart boys reversed that crack
the Humanz worked for you.

01:19:37.523 --> 01:19:40.231
Easy-breezy

Come on.
Let's boogie-woogie rock and roll.

01:20:18.689 --> 01:20:19.895
Whoop, whoop! (snickering)

01:20:20.316 --> 01:20:23.775
Biggest, baddest slayer in the game
doesn't seem like much, does he?

01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:26.773

01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:31.528

01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:33.488
Lucky shot. Whoa!

01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:37.580
(snickers) Not really.

01:20:41.921 --> 01:20:43.753
Hya! (laughs)

01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:51.514

All right, boys, you ready?
It's time for a true test.

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:39.676
Just like last time, remember?

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:46.065
Yeah, you're stronger now,
more fight in you. But the result

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:48.692
will be just about the same.

01:21:51.824 --> 01:21:53.360
I am right here with you.
