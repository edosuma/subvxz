WEBVTT

00:02.262 --> 00:03.329
Lemon.

00:03.397 --> 00:04.830
I just got my bridesmaid's dress

00:04.898 --> 00:06.132
For cerie's wedding.

00:06.199 --> 00:09.001
It is a vietnamese size two.

00:09.069 --> 00:10.870
Dressing up isn't
any easier for men.

00:10.938 --> 00:12.605
Do you know what it's like
when a younger man shows up

00:12.673 --> 00:14.073
Wearing the same cufflinks?

00:14.141 --> 00:15.408
You might as well be invisible.

00:15.475 --> 00:17.276
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
let this dress win.

00:17.344 --> 00:19.712
I have a plan.
This morning, I joined--

00:19.780 --> 00:20.913
- A suicide cult!
- A gym.

00:20.981 --> 00:22.048
What do you want, jack?

00:22.115 --> 00:23.816
I just received a
call from don geiss'

00:23.884 --> 00:25.017
Estate lawyer.

00:25.085 --> 00:27.620
Apparently, I've been
named in his will.

00:27.688 --> 00:30.289
I know this is a
difficult time for you,

00:30.357 --> 00:31.590
But word of advice:

00:31.658 --> 00:33.059
If the will says that you
have to spend the night

00:33.126 --> 00:34.460
In a haunted house,
you better hope

00:34.528 --> 00:36.462
That everybody else there
is black guys and sluts.

00:36.530 --> 00:38.397
I just want something
to remember the man by.

00:38.465 --> 00:40.566
- Okay.
- His pen or his tie clip.

00:40.634 --> 00:42.802
Maybe that boyhood
sled he held so dear.

00:42.869 --> 00:44.770
I believed he called it...

00:44.838 --> 00:46.472
Sleddy.

00:46.540 --> 00:47.807
Something which I, in turn,

00:47.874 --> 00:50.910
Can then pass on to my...
Protege.

00:50.978 --> 00:52.511
any chance it's one of those

00:52.579 --> 00:54.347
Bendy hospital beds?

00:54.414 --> 00:56.449
Maybe. He did have three.

00:57.651 --> 01:00.386
he was such an amazing man.

01:06.460 --> 01:16.500

01:22.342 --> 01:23.976
Before we rehearse,

01:24.044 --> 01:26.746
I have an announcement to make.

01:26.813 --> 01:30.249
Our boy grizz is getting
married on may 22nd.

01:32.252 --> 01:34.487
<i>Jeez, another wedding.</i>

01:34.554 --> 01:36.055
Life is like tv.

01:36.123 --> 01:38.024
Testing tells us that people
like weddings, births,

01:38.091 --> 01:40.292
And episodes where
a character dies.

01:40.360 --> 01:41.327
That's dumb.

01:41.395 --> 01:43.496
My heart!

01:43.563 --> 01:45.598
So I thought grizz might
want to take this time

01:45.665 --> 01:47.867
To announce who's
gonna be his best man.

01:47.934 --> 01:50.469
Um...I haven't decided yet.

01:50.537 --> 01:52.738
"um, I haven't decided yet."

01:52.806 --> 01:54.206
You sound like my mother

01:54.274 --> 01:56.075
Talking to the planned
parenthood lady.

01:56.143 --> 01:59.812
Seriously, which one of
your rich and famous friends

01:59.880 --> 02:02.515
With hepatitis b are
you going to pick?

02:02.582 --> 02:04.517
Let's not do this in
front of everybody.

02:04.584 --> 02:06.419
Let's not do this in
front of everybody?

02:06.486 --> 02:08.586
You sound like my mother
being pulled onstage

02:08.655 --> 02:10.656
At a 2 live crew concert.

02:10.723 --> 02:12.858
Damn.

02:12.926 --> 02:14.427
My mother had problems.

02:15.729 --> 02:17.129
Oh, brother,
we have to tell jenna

02:17.197 --> 02:18.798
We can't do her
kardashian sketch

02:18.865 --> 02:21.634
Because jack is "bros"
with lamar odom.

02:21.701 --> 02:23.135
you are such a coward!

02:23.203 --> 02:25.771
you think I care what you think?

02:25.839 --> 02:27.106
Hey, jenna!

02:27.174 --> 02:30.543
So look, we can't do
the kardashian sketch.

02:30.610 --> 02:32.912
Okay, I understand.

02:32.979 --> 02:34.613
Pete, there you are you.

02:34.681 --> 02:36.382
I heard one of your
kids broke his arm.

02:36.450 --> 02:38.284
Oh, uh, yeah.

02:38.351 --> 02:39.885
The shed I built
collapsed on him.

02:39.953 --> 02:41.020
Well, is he gonna be okay?

02:41.088 --> 02:42.088
What's going on?

02:42.155 --> 02:43.391
Why are you being
so happy and nice?

02:43.459 --> 02:47.493
Are you soaking your
tampo in vodka again?

02:53.061 --> 02:54.461
Because the glue is abrasive.

02:54.529 --> 02:57.497
But I'm really happy.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.334
Is there any chance

03:00.401 --> 03:01.501
This might make
our lives easier?

03:01.569 --> 03:03.370
No way. I have seen
this 100 times.

03:03.438 --> 03:04.838
She gets psyched about some guy,

03:04.906 --> 03:06.206
He reveals himself to be crazy,

03:06.274 --> 03:07.274
Then there's a terrible breakup,

03:07.342 --> 03:08.375
And we suffer.

03:08.443 --> 03:10.577
Remember when she
dated that sniper?

03:10.645 --> 03:13.080
And so it's over.

03:13.147 --> 03:14.648
Jenna, there's a laser
sight on your forehead.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.216
Oh, please. He's not gonna fire.

03:16.284 --> 03:18.085
For god's sakes,
he's scared of his own mother!

03:18.152 --> 03:19.353
Aren't cha, alan?

03:19.420 --> 03:20.420
Aah!

03:20.488 --> 03:22.022
Whoever this new guy is,

03:22.090 --> 03:23.357
We need to figure out his deal

03:23.424 --> 03:25.525
Before she gets burned
and takes it out on us.

03:25.593 --> 03:26.593
Tell me about it.

03:26.661 --> 03:28.862
Remember this breakup,
when she bit me?

03:28.930 --> 03:30.497
Pete, that was, like,
two years ago.

03:30.565 --> 03:32.599
It just won't heal.

03:32.667 --> 03:35.569
That concludes mr.
Geiss' financial disbursements.

03:35.637 --> 03:37.771
I believe all have
been accounted for.

03:37.839 --> 03:39.673
His daughter. His lovely wife.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.675
His even lovelier mistress.

03:41.743 --> 03:43.477
The secret canadian family.

03:43.544 --> 03:46.313
And his even more
secret attic family.

03:46.381 --> 03:49.049
L that remains are a
few personal items.

03:49.117 --> 03:50.384
"to my daughter cathy,

03:50.451 --> 03:52.252
"I bequeath my pocket watch.

03:52.320 --> 03:56.089
"it comes with very specific
instructions for care,

03:56.157 --> 03:57.357
"the most important of which

03:57.425 --> 03:59.760
Is to not let the
piece get wet."

04:04.565 --> 04:07.134
"to my protege and friend,
john francis donaghy,

04:07.201 --> 04:08.502
"I leave a gift

04:08.569 --> 04:11.038
"from the gardens of my
estate in connecticut.

04:11.105 --> 04:13.940
My beloved pet peacock, argus."

04:19.547 --> 04:22.549
Hello, old friend.

04:25.790 --> 04:26.924
Ugh! Vietnamese size two.

04:28.293 --> 04:29.827
Beth, I hope it
wasn't awkward for you

04:29.894 --> 04:31.428
When tracy brought
up my wedding.

04:31.496 --> 04:32.429
Why would it be awkward?

04:32.497 --> 04:34.632
Because of our sexual past.

04:36.001 --> 04:38.335
Leave it open. I'd feel safer.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.237
How could I help you, grizz?

04:40.305 --> 04:41.605
Well, tracy keeps pushing...

04:41.673 --> 04:42.640
To be your best man.

04:42.707 --> 04:43.807
Yeah, I noticed that.

04:43.875 --> 04:45.109
But I wanna pick dotcom and...

04:45.176 --> 04:48.145
And you're afraid that
tracy will freak out.

04:48.213 --> 04:51.181
So you want me to help you
convince him to step aside.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.483
You know my every thought, beth.

04:52.550 --> 04:55.285
We really were the sam
and diane of this place.

04:58.123 --> 04:59.857
no.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.260
Liz, pete,

05:03.328 --> 05:04.428
I want you to meet someone.

05:04.496 --> 05:06.263
This is my boyfriend paul.

05:06.331 --> 05:08.032
- Pete hornberger.
- Hey.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.167
But you can call me dallas.

05:10.235 --> 05:11.669
this could be the start
of something for me.

05:11.736 --> 05:13.404
It's really nice to meet you,

05:13.471 --> 05:15.005
And I'm a big fan of the show.

05:15.073 --> 05:16.807
Yeah, so, paul,
what's your deal?

05:16.875 --> 05:19.710
How did you guys meet?

05:19.778 --> 05:20.811
Through a mutual fund.

05:20.879 --> 05:22.012
Friend, jenna.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.181
Oh, of course.
Through a friend fund.

05:24.249 --> 05:25.282
Noted.

05:25.350 --> 05:27.718
And what do you do
for a living, paul?

05:27.786 --> 05:30.154
Oh, I work for a bank.

05:30.221 --> 05:31.855
-...Rupt circus.

05:31.923 --> 05:34.625
He works for a bankrupt circus.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.599
Okay, he's hiding something.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.535
I'm guessing...

05:44.602 --> 05:46.370
Already-married cat strangler.

05:46.438 --> 05:48.472
Hmm.

05:48.540 --> 05:50.074
Hey, could I just get a signa--

05:50.141 --> 05:52.042
Agh! Living dinosaur!

05:52.110 --> 05:53.243
Lemon.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.545
This is argus.

05:54.612 --> 05:56.146
He was a gift from don geiss.

05:56.214 --> 05:58.015
Don's last gift, to be exact.

05:58.083 --> 05:59.349
Why did don geiss
have a peacock?

05:59.417 --> 06:00.684
Is that an nbc thing?

06:00.752 --> 06:04.188
No, don owned argus long
before he bought nbc.

06:04.255 --> 06:07.157
Peacocks can live
up to 40 years,

06:07.225 --> 06:09.827
Longer if they're not part
of mike tyson's home zoo.

06:09.894 --> 06:11.061
Ohh, what a weird gift.

06:11.129 --> 06:12.329
Not at all.

06:12.397 --> 06:14.498
When don was first
taking me under his wing,

06:14.566 --> 06:16.600
He and I would sit
on the veranda

06:16.668 --> 06:17.701
Of his home in connecticut,

06:17.769 --> 06:19.837
Talking about business,
politics,

06:19.904 --> 06:22.072
How to avoid getting paper
cuts while making love

06:22.140 --> 06:23.607
On a pile of money.

06:23.675 --> 06:26.443
And our friend argus would strut
proudly through the garden.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.513
We three peacocks felt
like we owned the world.

06:29.581 --> 06:30.748
Well, that's a--

06:30.815 --> 06:32.783
how did he get up here so quick?

06:32.851 --> 06:34.651
You know, I never told
anybody this before, lemon,

06:34.719 --> 06:37.387
But don and I had
nicknames for each other.

06:37.455 --> 06:39.490
Like we might someday, j-town?

06:39.557 --> 06:42.392
We called each other
sempai and kohai.

06:42.460 --> 06:43.694
Master and pupil.

06:43.762 --> 06:45.829
Terms we learned
on a trip to japan

06:45.897 --> 06:48.065
<i>Because they played the movie
rising sun on the airplane.</i>

06:48.133 --> 06:50.501
Don was my sempai.

06:50.568 --> 06:53.270
Now this bird is...
All that remains.

06:53.338 --> 06:55.606
Jack, I'm really
sorry for your--

06:58.009 --> 06:59.309
Oh, his feather
went in my mouth.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.478
Ew, it's so oily.

07:01.546 --> 07:02.613
Lemon, he's marked you.

07:02.680 --> 07:04.748
He thinks you're his wife.

07:06.117 --> 07:08.252
Go! Get out.

07:08.319 --> 07:09.720
yah!

07:12.423 --> 07:14.057
Hey, tracy.

07:14.125 --> 07:15.492
Grizz and I were just talking.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.427
Of course.
You guys are very close.

07:17.495 --> 07:18.462
Continue.

07:18.530 --> 07:20.931
And we had an amazing idea.

07:20.499 --> 07:22.466
We thought that maybe,
at the wedding,

07:22.534 --> 07:25.336
You could be the lead
singer of the band.

07:25.404 --> 07:27.972
Really? I'd be awesome at that.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.206
You would.

07:29.274 --> 07:31.075
Now, of course you
couldn't sing and--

07:31.143 --> 07:32.743
But who's gonna tell you two?

07:32.811 --> 07:34.278
The wedding band is u2?

07:34.346 --> 07:36.247
No! You two idiots!

07:36.315 --> 07:38.149
I see what you're trying to do.

07:38.216 --> 07:39.784
You're trying to manipulate me

07:39.851 --> 07:41.686
Into not being the best man.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.287
And, damn it, grizz,

07:43.355 --> 07:45.656
I've known you since
you was six feet tall!

07:45.724 --> 07:48.092
I'm gonna be your best man!

07:48.160 --> 07:49.960
I am the leader
of this entourage!

07:50.028 --> 07:53.264
and because of you,
I'm having a tantrum!

07:53.332 --> 07:56.867
Now pick up that table
and smash it for me!

08:00.472 --> 08:01.639
That's right!

08:01.707 --> 08:03.774
I know that.

08:03.842 --> 08:05.343
Hey, jenna...

08:05.410 --> 08:06.344
What are you doing?

08:06.411 --> 08:09.113
I'm just feeling the weight

08:09.181 --> 08:11.716
Of jenna's jewelry
on my finger pads.

08:16.755 --> 08:18.889
pete!

08:18.957 --> 08:20.458
Pete!

08:20.525 --> 08:22.460
Ugh. Dallas. - What's up?

08:22.527 --> 08:24.095
Paul is getting weirder.

08:28.066 --> 08:29.667
We've got to step it up.

08:29.735 --> 08:31.836
You know what we should do,
we should follow him.

08:31.903 --> 08:33.003
I don't care how long it takes.

08:33.071 --> 08:34.038
What's going on?

08:34.106 --> 08:35.206
Your kids have a play tonight?

08:35.273 --> 08:36.440
<i>Oklahoma.</i>

08:36.508 --> 08:37.808
They couldn't find
cowboy hats big enough

08:37.876 --> 08:38.842
For my kid's head,

08:38.909 --> 08:40.077
So they're just wearing turbans.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.011
It's on. When paul leaves,
we follow him,

08:42.080 --> 08:43.179
Cia style.

08:43.248 --> 08:45.249
And afterwards, I go to the gym.

08:47.119 --> 08:50.321
Words are the first step
on the road to deeds!

08:54.459 --> 08:56.293
You wanted to see me, sir?

08:56.361 --> 08:58.929
Oh, my, what a
gorgeous swamp eagle.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.464
This is argus.

09:00.532 --> 09:04.101
He is very special to me.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.936
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.371
He's become listless.

09:07.439 --> 09:08.939
And he won't eat any
of the peacock food

09:09.007 --> 09:11.041
I got at the crazy rich
person's pet store.

09:11.109 --> 09:12.543
Frankly, I don't
know what to do.

09:14.413 --> 09:16.514
He's recently taken a mate.

09:16.581 --> 09:17.982
Lemon.

09:18.049 --> 09:19.717
Good luck, argus.

09:21.953 --> 09:24.655
Well, sir, there's nothing
wrong with this bird.

09:24.723 --> 09:27.024
He's just very old.

09:27.092 --> 09:28.893
Argus probably doesn't
have very long to live.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.295
All of your page
duties stop right now.

09:31.363 --> 09:33.664
The welfare of this bird
is your only concern.

09:33.732 --> 09:35.866
He lives...Or you die.

09:35.934 --> 09:39.136
I was about to suggest
the same thing.

09:43.809 --> 09:45.142
Hey, dummy,

09:45.210 --> 09:46.944
What are you doing to grizz?

09:47.012 --> 09:48.078
Whoa, you watch your mouth,

09:48.146 --> 09:51.115
Before I show you
the back of my hand.

09:53.785 --> 09:56.387
Look, you gotta grow up
about this best man thing.

09:56.455 --> 09:58.556
Liz lemon, I don't even
want to be best man.

09:58.623 --> 09:59.824
Why would I?

09:59.891 --> 10:01.859
Show up one time,
not lose a ring,

10:01.927 --> 10:04.061
Keep my shirt on
through a dinner? Psh.

10:04.129 --> 10:06.230
Then why are you
throwing a fit about it?

10:06.298 --> 10:09.066
Because I'm trying to
protect dotcom, dummy.

10:09.134 --> 10:11.235
He's in love with
grizz's fiancee...

10:11.303 --> 10:12.269
Feyonce!

10:12.337 --> 10:13.737
Oh, your stutter is back.

10:13.805 --> 10:17.107
No, grizz's fiancee's
name is feyonce.

10:17.175 --> 10:18.542
Like beyonce with an "f."

10:18.610 --> 10:19.910
- Ah, come on.
- Listen...

10:19.978 --> 10:21.512
We cannot make dotcom

10:21.580 --> 10:23.447
Get up there and give a
speech at that wedding.

10:23.515 --> 10:24.882
It'd kill him!

10:24.950 --> 10:26.684
Wow, I can't believe
that you are using

10:26.751 --> 10:29.553
Your infantile
selfishness for good.

10:29.621 --> 10:31.088
I'm impressed, tracy.

10:31.156 --> 10:32.756
You think that's impressive,

10:32.824 --> 10:34.658
Watch me stand on one foot.

10:37.162 --> 10:38.796
Hang on. I did it earlier.

10:38.864 --> 10:40.064
You're right, tracy.

10:40.131 --> 10:42.166
You've got to convince
grizz to choose you.

10:42.234 --> 10:43.434
No, you do.

10:43.502 --> 10:45.469
Why do I have to do everything?

10:45.537 --> 10:47.471
Oh! I am never gonna
fit in that dress.

10:47.539 --> 10:51.342
Bored!

10:51.409 --> 10:52.843
What? Ohh.

10:54.000 --> 11:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:01.686 --> 11:03.087
That's a bar.

11:03.154 --> 11:05.155
We're gonna have to
drink a lot to fit in.

11:09.261 --> 11:11.028
I don't understand
where he went.

11:11.096 --> 11:12.696
Can I get five more beers here?

11:12.764 --> 11:13.864
Name's dallas.

11:14.933 --> 11:16.200
I don't get it. Did we lose him?

11:16.268 --> 11:18.502
What if he's in a secret
back room doing pot?

11:18.570 --> 11:20.771
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

11:20.839 --> 11:23.741
For miss jinah baloney!

11:23.808 --> 11:25.409
what did he say?

11:25.477 --> 11:26.744
Is that jenna?

11:29.180 --> 11:31.081
No, it's paul.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.884
* my muffin top is all that *

11:33.952 --> 11:35.719
* whole grain, low fat *

11:35.787 --> 11:37.588
* I know you want
a piece of that *

11:37.656 --> 11:39.390
* but I just want to dance *

11:39.457 --> 11:41.659
I'm jenna. Naturally.

11:41.726 --> 11:45.563
Jenna's boyfriend is a
jenna maroney impersonator.

11:45.630 --> 11:46.830
* *

11:46.898 --> 11:47.932
Work it, miss thang.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.266
Oh, god.

11:49.334 --> 11:52.369
I'm gonna need five more
cranberry juices over here!

11:56.446 --> 11:59.215
Jack, I just found
out that jenna

11:59.283 --> 12:03.052
Is dating a guy who does
a drag show...As her.

12:03.120 --> 12:04.954
Lemon, what is with
this food layout?

12:05.022 --> 12:06.923
Kenneth says he needs
some sumac bark

12:06.990 --> 12:07.957
And shrub yellow root

12:08.025 --> 12:09.625
To make a poultice for argus.

12:09.693 --> 12:11.394
How is your thing
weirder than mine?

12:11.461 --> 12:13.195
I...

12:13.263 --> 12:14.864
I am not letting that bird die.

12:14.932 --> 12:16.132
And why does he have to?

12:16.199 --> 12:18.167
For god's sakes,
if we can put an ear

12:18.235 --> 12:19.502
On a mouse's back,

12:19.569 --> 12:21.203
We can certainly make
a peacock immortal.

12:21.271 --> 12:23.572
Oh, jack, I know this
is important to you,

12:23.640 --> 12:25.875
But it is just a bird.

12:25.943 --> 12:28.544
I mean, do you think maybe
you're so worked up about argus

12:28.612 --> 12:31.180
Because you never let
yourself grieve for don?

12:31.248 --> 12:32.882
I did grieve for don.

12:32.950 --> 12:34.317
As soon as jack welch told me,

12:34.384 --> 12:36.585
I went through all
five stages of grief.

12:36.653 --> 12:38.421
Don is dead.

12:38.488 --> 12:39.555
What?

12:39.623 --> 12:41.691
You didn't do anything.

12:41.758 --> 12:43.592
- Let me retell it-
- in slow motion.

12:43.660 --> 12:44.961
Don is dead.

12:47.998 --> 12:56.038
* *

13:02.279 --> 13:03.946
See?

13:04.014 --> 13:05.581
Sir, I just wanted
to let you know,

13:05.649 --> 13:06.782
Argus is sleeping.

13:06.850 --> 13:09.051
And you left him alone?

13:09.119 --> 13:10.319
What if he rolls
over on his back

13:10.387 --> 13:12.288
And his cloaca
fills with mucous?

13:13.657 --> 13:15.758
Oh, brother. This is
not about some peacock.

13:15.826 --> 13:17.193
We're gonna have to
help him, kenneth.

13:17.260 --> 13:18.828
I have an idea, but you're
gonna have to take the lead,

13:18.895 --> 13:20.229
Because I am stretched
pretty thin.

13:20.297 --> 13:22.665
Well, not new york thin, but--

13:22.733 --> 13:25.134
Don't worry,
I'm on it, ms. Lemon.

13:25.202 --> 13:27.169
Sorry--mrs. Argus.

13:27.237 --> 13:29.071
Okay.

13:29.139 --> 13:31.774
Beth, I need you to
do something for me.

13:31.842 --> 13:32.808
Yeah, actually,
I need to talk to you

13:32.876 --> 13:33.809
About the wedding.

13:33.877 --> 13:35.311
I'm too upset to talk.

13:35.379 --> 13:36.679
Look at me.

13:38.882 --> 13:41.717
What's this?

13:41.785 --> 13:44.487
Grizz has asked me to
read this to both of you.

13:44.554 --> 13:46.255
"dear friends,

13:46.323 --> 13:49.091
"I don't want any more
fighting or bad feelings.

13:49.159 --> 13:51.761
"tracy, I love you,
but I've known dotcom

13:51.828 --> 13:54.397
"ever since we went to
above the beanstalk,

13:54.464 --> 13:56.766
"a free summer camp for giants.

13:56.833 --> 13:59.101
"I want him to be my best man.

13:59.169 --> 14:00.636
"and if you care about me,

14:00.704 --> 14:01.971
"you'll respect my decision.

14:02.039 --> 14:03.572
I will always be your"--

14:03.640 --> 14:06.375
Oh, no, I'm white.
I can't read that word.

14:06.443 --> 14:08.744
<i>"friend from the neighborhood.</i>

14:08.812 --> 14:10.513
Grizz."

14:11.982 --> 14:13.716
I'm so honored.

14:13.784 --> 14:15.084
Now no one is getting hurt.

14:15.152 --> 14:16.652
No one at all.

14:16.720 --> 14:17.853
Thanks, guys.

14:17.921 --> 14:19.755
I'm so happy.

14:27.731 --> 14:29.765
Hey! Jenna!

14:29.833 --> 14:31.801
So nice to meet paul!

14:31.868 --> 14:33.102
Interesting guy.

14:33.170 --> 14:34.837
How much do you know about him?

14:34.905 --> 14:36.639
Well, I lost a toe ring in him,

14:36.706 --> 14:37.973
So I'd say a lot.

14:38.041 --> 14:40.743
No, I mean, like,
what he does...

14:40.811 --> 14:41.977
At night,
and what he wears there

14:42.045 --> 14:43.412
And who he's being.

14:43.480 --> 14:46.449
So...You know about paul's act.

14:46.516 --> 14:48.084
Wait, you know about paul's act?

14:48.151 --> 14:49.685
How do you think we met?

14:49.753 --> 14:51.987
Paul won a jenna maroney
impersonator contest,

14:52.055 --> 14:54.123
At which I came in fourth.

14:54.191 --> 14:55.958
And now you're dating him?

14:56.026 --> 14:57.493
That's it, right there.

14:57.561 --> 14:58.527
That face.

14:58.595 --> 15:00.029
That is exactly why

15:00.097 --> 15:01.730
I didn't tell you about
paul in the first place.

15:01.798 --> 15:04.300
Your judgmental badger face.

15:04.367 --> 15:06.001
Jenna, even for you,

15:06.069 --> 15:08.304
This is weird. Be a friend, liz.

15:08.371 --> 15:09.872
Until then, I don't
want to talk to you.

15:12.509 --> 15:15.678
Looks like one of
us is in trouble.

15:21.384 --> 15:23.853
- How is he?
- He's awake. But...

15:23.920 --> 15:24.987
But what?

15:25.055 --> 15:26.122
Well, sir,

15:26.189 --> 15:28.224
I've spent a lot of
time with peafowl.

15:28.291 --> 15:30.326
They make all sorts
of different noises.

15:33.897 --> 15:36.098
ooh, that's a car alarm.

15:36.166 --> 15:37.366
Kenneth, what's your point?

15:37.434 --> 15:40.336
It's just I've never
in all my life

15:40.403 --> 15:41.770
Heard a peacock say

15:41.838 --> 15:44.106
Sempai and kohai.

15:44.174 --> 15:45.674
What did you say?

15:45.742 --> 15:47.476
Sempai and kohai.

15:47.544 --> 15:49.545
At least, that's
what it sounded like.

15:51.448 --> 15:53.549
Kenneth, I've been under
a lot of strain lately.

15:53.617 --> 15:56.152
But do you believe a human soul

15:56.219 --> 15:58.754
Could be transferred
into an animal vessel?

15:58.822 --> 16:00.523
Sir, I think that there's
a lot about this world

16:00.590 --> 16:02.124
That we don't understand.

16:02.192 --> 16:03.559
Like the afterlife.

16:03.627 --> 16:06.462
Or how bread turns into toast.

16:09.900 --> 16:11.133
Liz,

16:11.201 --> 16:13.869
I am in love with grizz's
fiancee, feyonce.

16:13.937 --> 16:15.237
Oh, my god!

16:15.305 --> 16:16.805
I definitely didn't know that.

16:16.873 --> 16:18.874
Would you talk to
grizz and convince him

16:18.942 --> 16:20.442
Tracy should be his best man?

16:20.510 --> 16:22.645
Okay, yeah. I'll try to help.

16:22.712 --> 16:24.413
But can I please go
to the gym first?

16:24.481 --> 16:26.282
No.

16:29.319 --> 16:30.252
Hello.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.253
badger.

16:31.321 --> 16:32.321
It's another badger.

16:32.389 --> 16:34.089
The third badger
has taken the bait.

16:34.157 --> 16:36.425
Why is everyone
code named badger?

16:36.493 --> 16:38.327
I thought you said you
wanted to do it this way.

16:38.395 --> 16:40.663
No, I said I didn't care.

16:46.703 --> 16:49.338
Jenna, can we please
talk about this

16:49.406 --> 16:51.340
Before it becomes a big--

16:51.408 --> 16:53.042
Aah! - Hello, liz.

16:53.109 --> 16:55.277
Jenna told me I didn't need
to hide from you anymore.

16:55.345 --> 16:57.079
All right,
let's cut to the chase.

16:57.147 --> 16:58.847
What's your game, friend?

16:58.915 --> 17:00.015
What are you getting out of this

17:00.083 --> 17:01.617
<i>What am I getting out of this?</i>

17:01.685 --> 17:02.785
Yeah.

17:02.852 --> 17:04.520
I am the luckiest
"shman" in the world.

17:04.588 --> 17:07.089
I get to be with
the most talented,

17:07.156 --> 17:08.991
Beautiful, sexy woman ever.

17:09.059 --> 17:11.292
So you aren't just
using her for your act?

17:11.361 --> 17:12.661
My act?

17:12.729 --> 17:15.364
I'd never tuck my penis
again if she asked me.

17:15.432 --> 17:16.832
All I want to do

17:16.900 --> 17:20.336
Is spend my days listening
to her talk and sing

17:20.403 --> 17:22.704
And scream at her cleaning
lady on the phone.

17:22.771 --> 17:24.373
To be honest, liz,

17:24.441 --> 17:26.709
I just don't understand
what she gets out of it.

17:26.776 --> 17:29.245
I think I do, paul.

17:29.312 --> 17:31.413
She finally gets
to love herself.

17:31.481 --> 17:32.448
It's perfect.

17:32.515 --> 17:35.050
What are you two talking about?

17:35.118 --> 17:36.051
You, jenna.

17:36.119 --> 17:38.887
Ooh.

17:38.955 --> 17:41.523
This situation is
empirically weird.

17:41.591 --> 17:44.226
But...I'm glad you're happy.

17:44.294 --> 17:46.495
I heard what you said about me.

17:46.563 --> 17:48.063
You're so sweet.

17:48.131 --> 17:49.999
God, you're incredible.

17:51.768 --> 17:54.570
Okay, guys, let's just...

17:54.638 --> 17:58.207
Ew, jenna, why are you
grabbing his boobs?

18:06.116 --> 18:08.050
I don't know, argus.

18:08.118 --> 18:09.885
Maybe it's the scotch talking,

18:09.953 --> 18:12.288
But I think...

18:12.355 --> 18:15.491
There might be a man's
soul inside you.

18:21.998 --> 18:24.199
This is crazy, but, don,

18:24.267 --> 18:27.002
If you're in there...

18:27.070 --> 18:28.537
Give me a sign.

18:35.078 --> 18:36.211
You want a drink.

19:00.470 --> 19:03.238
Don...

19:03.306 --> 19:04.573
Sempai...

19:04.641 --> 19:06.075
There's just a few things

19:06.142 --> 19:07.743
I want you to know.

19:07.811 --> 19:10.612
You're the father
that I never had.

19:11.781 --> 19:12.781
Just let me finish.

19:12.849 --> 19:14.483
I want to live the
rest of my life

19:14.551 --> 19:17.686
In a way that'll make you proud.

19:17.754 --> 19:20.356
I just wish you could be
here to watch me do it.

19:29.899 --> 19:31.700
Good-bye, sir.

19:36.473 --> 19:37.840
All right, grizz.

19:37.907 --> 19:39.641
I'm gonna speak
frankly to you now.

19:39.709 --> 19:41.510
And I can do that
because of our...

19:41.578 --> 19:42.911
Sexual past.

19:42.979 --> 19:44.847
Damn, beth, let it go.

19:46.149 --> 19:48.984
Don't even have a best man.

19:49.052 --> 19:50.819
Your wedding day

19:50.887 --> 19:52.821
Is about you and your bride.

19:52.889 --> 19:55.090
So who cares what anyone thinks?

19:55.158 --> 19:56.625
Love isn't judgmental.

19:56.693 --> 19:58.460
Love is patient.

19:58.528 --> 20:00.095
Love is...Weird.

20:00.163 --> 20:03.132
And sometimes gross.

20:03.199 --> 20:05.033
Love is elusive.

20:05.101 --> 20:06.301
And you found it.

20:06.369 --> 20:07.636
So treasure it.

20:07.704 --> 20:10.339
And maybe don't leave
it alone with dotcom.

20:10.407 --> 20:12.574
That was beautiful.

20:12.642 --> 20:13.776
Look at me...

20:13.843 --> 20:16.779
Crying like a baby.

20:16.846 --> 20:19.348
So now I am grizz and feyonce's

20:19.416 --> 20:20.482
Woman of honor.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.284
And he wants me to
give the same speech

20:22.352 --> 20:25.220
At the hunts point marriott
while wearing a dashiki.

20:25.288 --> 20:26.422

20:26.489 --> 20:28.123
In three weddings in
the same day, yeah.

20:34.921 --> 20:39.892

20:39.959 --> 20:44.463
