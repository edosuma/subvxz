00:11.323 --> 00:14.097
Dude, see the way that Heather was
checking you out in the cafeteria?

00:14.345 --> 00:15.578
Get out. Get out.

00:15.759 --> 00:17.976
Man, I'm serious.
She's totally into you.

00:17.978 --> 00:19.511
Heather's kind of hot.

00:20.170 --> 00:22.720
Ooh, Heather. You're so hot.

00:22.722 --> 00:24.722
I love you so much.

00:24.724 --> 00:26.174
Shut it, dweeb.

00:26.176 --> 00:28.393
Dude, I'm telling you,
you should text Heather.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.812
Yeah, maybe I will.

00:33.266 --> 00:35.099
[Thunk] Aah...

00:35.101 --> 00:36.017
What's in there?

00:36.019 --> 00:38.820
Hey, have a look at this.

_

00:50.617 --> 00:53.051
Alvez: You getting tired yet?

00:55.538 --> 00:57.288
How you doin', huh?

00:57.290 --> 00:59.173
You good?

00:59.175 --> 01:01.709
You need a break, you
just let me know, ok?

01:01.711 --> 01:03.261
We can stop.

01:03.263 --> 01:05.379
Hey. Hey.

01:05.382 --> 01:07.799
Show-off!

01:10.937 --> 01:12.136
Show-off.

01:12.138 --> 01:13.304
Come here.

01:13.306 --> 01:15.306
Here, want some water?

01:15.308 --> 01:16.974
Come on. No?

01:18.728 --> 01:19.777
All right.

01:19.779 --> 01:21.362
Let's go home.

01:21.364 --> 01:23.314
Let's go!

01:35.161 --> 01:38.063
[Snoring]

01:38.665 --> 01:39.931
The blue or the gray?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.049
Hmm?

01:41.051 --> 01:43.668
Yeah, going with the blue.

01:46.172 --> 01:49.841
Yeah, she's gotta have her veggies.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.676
A little...

01:51.678 --> 01:54.145
[Whimpering]

01:54.147 --> 01:55.313
[Barks]

02:05.024 --> 02:08.493
All right, Jaynie's coming by
to walk you later, all right?

02:08.495 --> 02:09.443
[Barks]

02:09.446 --> 02:11.112
[Chuckles] All right, Roger that.

02:11.114 --> 02:13.664
I'll bring you a treat.

02:13.666 --> 02:15.083
Be good.

02:15.085 --> 02:17.119
[Whimpers]

02:25.211 --> 02:28.212
Some things never change.

02:28.214 --> 02:29.347
Hey, you!

02:29.349 --> 02:30.298
Hi.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.349
Mwah! Mwah!

02:31.351 --> 02:32.383
Aah! Welcome back!

02:32.385 --> 02:33.968
[Laughing]

02:33.970 --> 02:36.521
Doughnuts? Wait, did
you happen to get...

02:36.523 --> 02:38.723
Chocolate frosted with sprinkles? Yes.

02:38.725 --> 02:39.891
How could I forget your favorite?

02:39.893 --> 02:42.276
It is so great to see you.

02:42.278 --> 02:43.694
Even if it's only temporary.

02:43.696 --> 02:45.196
Well, when Hotch told me

02:45.198 --> 02:46.981
the director tapped him
for special assignment,

02:46.983 --> 02:48.950
I wanted to help out.
More so when he said

02:48.952 --> 02:51.903
you guys still have escaped
serial killers you have to catch,

02:51.905 --> 02:54.155
on top of your normal caseload?

02:54.157 --> 02:55.706
Lewis is going to be
sorry she missed you.

02:55.708 --> 02:57.074
Oh, yeah, me, too.

02:57.076 --> 03:00.578
That's actually Luke Alvez's desk.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.914
Really? It looks empty.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.166
Uh, well, he travels light.

03:05.168 --> 03:06.834
Garcia said he was ex-army.

03:06.836 --> 03:08.953
Came over from the Fugitive Task Force ?

03:08.955 --> 03:10.171
Yeah, you're gonna like him.

03:10.173 --> 03:13.107
You know, the lack of
personal effects on his desk

03:13.109 --> 03:15.843
could stem from his days
as a fugitive hunter.

03:15.845 --> 03:19.263
He probably felt like he was never
once place long enough to dig in.

03:19.265 --> 03:22.433
I mean, no family photos,
no significant others.

03:22.435 --> 03:24.268
Not even a plant to over water.

03:24.270 --> 03:27.405
I mean, this Alvez could
be a real loner type.

03:27.407 --> 03:29.407
Somebody could have done
a real number on this guy.

03:29.409 --> 03:30.441
An ex, maybe.

03:30.443 --> 03:32.109
I mean, no doubt the army taught him

03:32.111 --> 03:34.078
order and discipline,
but a desk like this

03:34.080 --> 03:37.331
could mean he has commitment issues.

03:37.333 --> 03:39.283
He's behind me right now, isn't he?

03:39.285 --> 03:42.537
Luke Alvez, meet Emily Prentiss.

03:42.539 --> 03:44.288
Hey. Hey. Nice to meet you.

03:44.290 --> 03:45.957
Emily used to be part of our team,

03:45.959 --> 03:48.176
and now she's the unit
chief for Interpol in London.

03:48.178 --> 03:49.427
Yeah, she's agreed to help us out

03:49.429 --> 03:50.795
while Hotch is off on a TDY

03:50.797 --> 03:52.597
and Lewis works on her research.

03:52.599 --> 03:55.716
I'm on temporary duty,
so I'll be in and out.

03:55.718 --> 03:57.969
I'll be working on and off.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.220
I'm on today.

03:59.222 --> 04:01.189
Obviously. I'm just...

04:01.191 --> 04:02.974
I'm really happy that I could, uh,

04:02.976 --> 04:04.942
come back, you know, and help...

04:04.944 --> 04:07.478
Truth be told, it's
pretty hard to resist

04:07.480 --> 04:09.947
putting the band back
together again, so...

04:09.949 --> 04:12.483
Yeah, so, I'm here to help.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.452
Well, we have a lot on our plate.

04:14.454 --> 04:17.154
Garcia: Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

04:17.156 --> 04:21.158
Speaking of which, looks
like we have a case.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.964
- Hey, Garcia.
- [Gasps]

04:26.966 --> 04:29.917
You really are here.
It's a dream come true.

04:29.919 --> 04:31.719
Have you met Luke Alvez?

04:31.721 --> 04:33.754
Oh, yeah, we just met.

04:33.756 --> 04:36.424
So you know how I like to
sometimes say something clever

04:36.426 --> 04:39.927
before I say something sad
and disturbing to self-soothe.

04:39.929 --> 04:42.763
To that end, uh, please make sure

04:42.765 --> 04:44.515
your seat backs and your tray tables

04:44.517 --> 04:45.816
are in their fully upright position,

04:45.818 --> 04:48.819
because yesterday in South Florida,

04:48.821 --> 04:50.988
the body of a woman was found

04:50.990 --> 04:55.159
encased in concrete in a 55-gallon drum.

04:55.161 --> 04:58.145
Lisa Barclay, 35, single mom,

04:58.147 --> 05:00.798
lived with her 13-year-old son

05:00.800 --> 05:02.199
in Boynton Beach.

05:02.201 --> 05:04.902
If she was encased in
concrete, how'd they I.D. her?

05:04.904 --> 05:07.255
Because the M.E. was
able to match prints

05:07.257 --> 05:11.008
from 3 of her fingers that
broke through the surface.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.260
When did she go missing?

05:12.262 --> 05:13.544
About a week ago.

05:13.546 --> 05:14.812
Where did they find the drum?

05:14.814 --> 05:17.214
At an illegal dump site.
Some teenagers found it.

05:17.216 --> 05:18.799
Uh, local P.D. needs to canvass the area

05:18.801 --> 05:20.384
for more possible victims.

05:20.386 --> 05:21.719
They're doing that right now.

05:21.721 --> 05:22.937
Any signs of sexual assault?

05:22.939 --> 05:24.438
That is unclear at this time

05:24.440 --> 05:26.557
because they're still removing
the concrete from her body.

05:26.559 --> 05:31.195
Burying his victim like this may
be the unsub's form of torture.

05:31.197 --> 05:33.114
It could be a forensic countermeasure.

05:33.116 --> 05:34.899
Or a sign of remorse or undoing.

05:34.901 --> 05:37.868
Unfortunately, all of you
could be right, because...

05:37.870 --> 05:39.720
Is... is that...

05:39.722 --> 05:42.456
An ultrasound of the drum.

05:48.331 --> 05:53.250
Lisa Barclay was still alive
when he put her in there.

Prentiss: Tyron Edwards wrote,

06:26.677 --> 06:29.678
"sinful and forbidden pleasures
are like poisoned bread.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.431
"They may satisfy
appetite for the moment,

06:32.433 --> 06:34.933
but there is death in them at the end."

06:34.935 --> 06:36.935
Reid: Lisa Barclay lived
a low-risk lifestyle.

06:36.937 --> 06:38.654
She and her son moved to Boynton Beach

06:38.656 --> 06:40.272
after her divorce 4 years ago.

06:41.328 --> 06:43.128
So is this the work of a jealous ex?

06:43.130 --> 06:44.496
Unlikely.

06:44.498 --> 06:46.481
It appears the divorce was amicable.

06:46.483 --> 06:49.501
The ex-husband remarried
and lives in Texas.

06:49.503 --> 06:51.503
He sends child support
checks like clockwork.

06:51.505 --> 06:53.171
She worked as an assistant bank manager.

06:53.173 --> 06:55.306
If she was known as a whistle blower,

06:55.308 --> 06:56.891
this could be a way of silencing her.

06:56.893 --> 06:59.010
What bumps me is how the unsub

06:59.012 --> 07:00.678
disposed of the barrel.

07:00.680 --> 07:01.813
I mean, there's no way

07:01.815 --> 07:04.099
that he lifted that sucker up.
It must weigh...

07:04.101 --> 07:05.734
542 pounds, give or take.

07:05.736 --> 07:08.353
Depending on such factors as
moisture content of the concrete,

07:08.355 --> 07:09.687
the victim's body weight,

07:09.689 --> 07:11.106
and the laws of displacement.

07:11.108 --> 07:13.158
Which still begs the question,

07:13.160 --> 07:14.359
how did he lift it?

07:14.361 --> 07:17.095
We could be looking
at two unsubs, maybe?

07:17.097 --> 07:19.697
Guys, I hate to interrupt, but
a second drum has been found

07:19.699 --> 07:21.783
with a woman's body encased
in concrete inside it.

07:21.785 --> 07:23.084
JJ: Where?

07:23.086 --> 07:24.719
At another illegal dump site

07:24.721 --> 07:27.455
not far from where
Lisa Barclay was found.

07:27.457 --> 07:29.924
Two women in literal dump sites.

07:29.926 --> 07:31.960
He must view his victims as garbage.

07:31.962 --> 07:35.213
Prentiss, you and I will check
out the latest crime scene.

07:35.215 --> 07:37.265
JJ, set up at the local P.D.

07:37.267 --> 07:39.684
Spencer, Luke, talk to the M.E.

07:41.341 --> 07:43.579
_

07:44.141 --> 07:46.724
So, you still like driving
on the left side of the road?

07:46.726 --> 07:47.976
Yeah. London's good.

07:47.978 --> 07:50.228
And Mark? He treating you right?

07:50.230 --> 07:51.863
'Cause if not, you give me the word.

07:51.865 --> 07:54.899
[Laughs] Thanks, Rossi,
we're very happy.

07:54.901 --> 07:57.569
What about you and Hayden?
Are you still going strong?

07:57.571 --> 07:59.370
And then some.

07:59.372 --> 08:00.455
Wow.

08:00.457 --> 08:01.456
Agent Rossi.

08:01.458 --> 08:02.457
Hey.

08:02.459 --> 08:03.491
Detective Ogilvie.

08:03.493 --> 08:05.243
Good to see you again.
This is SSA Prentiss.

08:05.245 --> 08:07.078
My pleasure. Right this way.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.215
Careful. Hope you've
had your tetanus shots.

08:10.217 --> 08:13.251
Here's where the second drum was found.

08:13.253 --> 08:15.637
The unsub had to overcome
a lot of obstacles

08:15.639 --> 08:16.721
to get the drum here.

08:16.723 --> 08:18.139
He'd also need a vehicle

08:18.141 --> 08:19.641
capable of supporting a lot of weight.

08:19.643 --> 08:21.392
Maybe a pickup, dual-wheels.

08:21.394 --> 08:23.795
What if he's mixing the
cement at the disposal sites?

08:23.797 --> 08:25.146
It would be a messy job.

08:25.148 --> 08:26.764
I don't see any evidence of that.

08:26.766 --> 08:28.149
He might have used a steel dolly

08:28.151 --> 08:29.317
to get the drum here,

08:29.319 --> 08:30.902
but it couldn't have been easy.

08:30.904 --> 08:32.937
So why here? The guy could have

08:32.938 --> 08:34.438
rolled it off the embankment

08:34.441 --> 08:35.523
of any canal in the area.

08:35.525 --> 08:36.991
It would have sank right out of sight.

08:36.993 --> 08:38.159
Officer: Detective.

08:38.160 --> 08:39.443
Excuse me.

08:40.330 --> 08:42.947
The hard to reach locations,

08:42.948 --> 08:44.782
the drums, the concrete.

08:44.784 --> 08:47.168
This unsub is jumping
through a whole lot of hoops

08:47.170 --> 08:48.369
to hide these bodies.

08:48.371 --> 08:50.004
It must mean something to him.

08:50.006 --> 08:52.123
Part of a ritual, maybe.

08:52.125 --> 08:54.759
Drums could symbolize coffins,

08:54.761 --> 08:57.428
the concrete, tomb or headstone.

08:57.430 --> 09:00.215
All the earmarks of a cemetery.

09:00.217 --> 09:05.803
Which means, this could be
his private burial ground.

09:05.805 --> 09:07.805
Reid: Dr. Durboraw?

09:07.807 --> 09:08.806
[Turns off drill]

09:08.808 --> 09:09.974
Dr. Durboraw. Hi.

09:09.976 --> 09:11.809
Sorry. I didn't hear you come in.

09:11.811 --> 09:15.964
I'm Dr. Spencer Reid.
This is agent Alvez.

09:15.966 --> 09:19.651
The unsub may have a gender
preference, but not race.

09:19.653 --> 09:21.903
How long had Lisa
Barclay been in the drum?

09:21.905 --> 09:25.290
Based on the condition
of the body, about a week.

09:27.627 --> 09:30.295
Ligature marks. He restrained her.

09:30.297 --> 09:31.412
Have you determined C.O.D.?

09:31.414 --> 09:33.498
X-rays showed she had
concrete in her mouth,

09:33.500 --> 09:36.467
trachea, and lungs. She drowned in it.

09:36.469 --> 09:39.754
I won't know more until I
can complete a full exam.

09:39.756 --> 09:42.006
She shows severe decomposition,

09:42.008 --> 09:43.508
but we should be able to I.D. her

09:43.510 --> 09:46.311
through DNA or dental records of
other missing women in the area.

09:46.313 --> 09:48.513
I see you tried dermal
tissue rehydration

09:48.515 --> 09:50.098
to get her fingerprints.

09:50.100 --> 09:53.151
My initial examination noted
friction ridges were still visible.

09:53.153 --> 09:55.403
You can rehydrate mummified skin?

09:55.405 --> 09:58.022
It's a method adapted from
an archaeological study

09:58.024 --> 09:59.107
on Egyptian mummies.

09:59.109 --> 10:01.576
The loose rehydrated
skin is then slipped over

10:01.578 --> 10:04.362
a living person's fingertip and
it's used to get the victim's print.

10:04.364 --> 10:06.364
I'm running them through the system now.

10:06.366 --> 10:08.700
You know, we initially thought
that she was the second victim.

10:08.702 --> 10:10.034
But the mummification indicates

10:10.036 --> 10:12.837
that she was actually
killed before Lisa Barclay,

10:12.839 --> 10:15.089
making her the original known victim.

10:15.091 --> 10:16.941
I'd say a month before.

10:16.943 --> 10:19.627
This isn't the pre-mixed
ready-to-use kind,

10:19.629 --> 10:21.930
which means that he
went through the trouble

10:21.932 --> 10:23.932
to mix his own sand, cement, and gravel.

10:23.934 --> 10:26.217
He obviously has the
skills to make it himself

10:26.219 --> 10:28.386
or access to it through his job.

Hey.

10:39.649 --> 10:40.865
I'm at work.

10:40.867 --> 10:42.367
Hey, guys. Incoming.

10:42.369 --> 10:45.153
Yeah, I'll be home for dinner.

10:46.456 --> 10:49.073
No, she hasn't called.

No texts or emails either, no.

10:53.713 --> 10:55.630
How should I know?

10:55.632 --> 10:58.034
Look, I can't talk now.

10:59.636 --> 11:01.586
Yeah, when I get home.

11:01.588 --> 11:03.921
Hi. Sorry to bother you,

11:03.923 --> 11:06.174
do you have any idea when
you'll be finished here?

11:06.176 --> 11:08.226
It's hard to tell, ma'am.
Probably not till Friday.

11:08.228 --> 11:11.729
But, Mom, I invited the
guys over to go swimming.

11:11.731 --> 11:13.264

11:13.266 --> 11:14.565
Uh, really, that long?

11:14.567 --> 11:15.566
Sorry, ma'am.

11:15.568 --> 11:17.185
Ok. Uh, all right, I'll tell you what.

11:21.524 --> 11:22.573

11:22.575 --> 11:24.692
All right. Thanks
anyways. Have a good one.

11:26.830 --> 11:29.197
Yeah, I got your good
one right here, huh?

that is somebody's mother?

11:38.375 --> 11:42.343
Mm. Well, we can rule out
Lisa Barclay's job as a motive.

11:42.345 --> 11:44.295
According to Garcia, there's no evidence

11:44.297 --> 11:45.680
of fraud at the bank where she worked

11:45.682 --> 11:48.099
and nothing suspicious
about her finances.

11:48.101 --> 11:51.302
Prints came back on
our unidentified victim.

11:51.304 --> 11:54.138
They belong to Sharon Landon,

11:54.140 --> 11:56.774
33, of Delray Beach.

11:56.776 --> 11:59.143
She was reported missing a month ago.

11:59.145 --> 12:00.778
Her husband died last year,

12:00.780 --> 12:04.482
leaving her and a
10-year-old son named Malcolm.

12:04.484 --> 12:06.984
Both victims were young single moms.

12:06.986 --> 12:09.487
Each had a son and lived
in neighboring towns.

12:09.489 --> 12:11.155
They must be surrogates.

12:11.157 --> 12:14.325
He crossed racial lines, so it's
gotta be about single mothers.

12:14.327 --> 12:17.128
I'll have Garcia look for a
connection between the mothers,

12:17.130 --> 12:18.429
maybe through the sons.

12:18.431 --> 12:22.133
Agents, Malcolm Landon is here.
He came in with his aunt.

12:22.135 --> 12:23.835
Thank you.

12:23.837 --> 12:27.004
Why don't you two see
what you can find out.

12:29.843 --> 12:32.343
Why did someone hurt my mom?

12:32.345 --> 12:34.729
We don't know yet.

12:34.731 --> 12:38.599
But we're working really
hard to find out why, ok?

12:38.601 --> 12:42.403
Prentiss: Malcolm, I bet you had
a lot of friends where you live.

12:42.405 --> 12:45.073
That's ok, baby.

12:45.075 --> 12:47.191
Yes, ma'am. Lots.

12:47.193 --> 12:49.861
Have you ever noticed any
strangers hanging around

12:49.863 --> 12:51.245
when you're out playing,

12:51.247 --> 12:54.949
maybe a man who looked
like he didn't belong there?

12:54.951 --> 12:58.035
Uh, a workman in a uniform, maybe?

12:59.672 --> 13:02.790
They were always fixing stuff.

13:02.792 --> 13:04.375

have a special friend,

13:14.721 --> 13:18.022

to take her out to dinner,

13:19.359 --> 13:23.144
Agents, dating was the
last thing on Sharon's mind.

13:23.146 --> 13:27.565
She focused all of her
energies on Malcolm.

She said it was just me and her,

13:30.570 --> 13:33.704

13:56.679 --> 13:59.981
There's no cross-over between
Lisa Barclay and Sharon Landon

13:59.983 --> 14:02.683
or between their kids. How
did it go with Malcolm Landon?

14:02.685 --> 14:06.437
Uh, well, he mentioned seeing
some workers at the condo complex.

14:06.439 --> 14:08.606
Emily's following up.

14:08.608 --> 14:10.858
You ok?

14:12.111 --> 14:15.613
Yeah. You know, Sharon Landon
seemed like such a great mom.

14:15.615 --> 14:16.781
You know? She didn't
think about herself.

14:16.783 --> 14:18.616
She devoted her whole life to her son.

14:18.618 --> 14:21.202
Garcia said the same
thing about Lisa Barclay.

14:21.204 --> 14:24.505
Yeah. If the unsub was raised by
a single mom and she died young,

14:24.507 --> 14:26.958
he might blame her for
leaving him on his own.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.293
Punishing his victims could
be his way of punishing her.

14:29.295 --> 14:32.296
Or she may have been an
absent or abusive mother.

14:32.298 --> 14:34.966
So when he sees a mom doting on her son,

14:34.968 --> 14:38.019
he may want to kill what he never had.

14:44.944 --> 14:47.645
Last seen dropping her son and
his friends off at the mall,

14:47.647 --> 14:49.113
and when she didn't
show to pick them up,

14:49.115 --> 14:50.281
he called a neighbor who found evidence

14:50.283 --> 14:52.316
of a struggle at her home.

14:52.318 --> 14:54.151
You two go to the condo.

15:43.089 --> 15:45.756
Well, it takes some cojones
to abduct another woman

15:45.758 --> 15:48.642
with the cops out in force
and all the news coverage.

15:48.644 --> 15:50.928
I mean, he's gotta know
we're looking for him.

15:50.930 --> 15:52.930
Yeah, well, his need-based compulsion

15:52.932 --> 15:55.649
is making a cooling-off
period too difficult.

15:55.651 --> 15:59.436
See, the unsub dumped
the first two victims

15:59.438 --> 16:00.988
here and here.

16:00.990 --> 16:03.324
And this is our current location.

16:03.326 --> 16:06.944
We have a triangle.

16:06.946 --> 16:09.330
What's so special about
these 3 dump sites?

16:09.332 --> 16:10.948
It's about more than that.

16:12.668 --> 16:16.154
It's what's in here
that's important to him.

16:19.037 --> 16:21.121
I hate to use the word
luck in this situation,

16:21.123 --> 16:24.341
but it was fortunate you found
the latest victim so quickly.

16:24.343 --> 16:26.259
The concrete had no
time to cure completely.

16:26.261 --> 16:28.712
She has the same ligature
marks as Lisa Barclay.

16:28.714 --> 16:30.564
The C.O.D. is the same, too.

16:30.643 --> 16:31.976
She drowned in the concrete.

16:32.082 --> 16:33.381
Any sign of sexual assault?

16:33.383 --> 16:34.916
I'm still conducting my exam,

16:34.918 --> 16:37.669
but I can tell you that
based on core body temperature

16:37.671 --> 16:40.471
and lividity, time of death
was about two hours ago.

16:40.473 --> 16:42.557
Kim Conti went missing 18 hours ago,

16:42.559 --> 16:45.143
but he kept her alive for some reason.

16:45.145 --> 16:47.478
I see that there's tissue
damage. Have you tested that?

16:47.480 --> 16:50.765
Not yet. But concrete
itself can be corrosive.

16:50.767 --> 16:53.101
There appears to be more damage here.

16:53.103 --> 16:54.852
Do you have a light I can borrow?

16:54.854 --> 16:56.154
Thanks.

16:58.074 --> 16:59.741
It's chemical burns.

16:59.743 --> 17:01.242
Look.

17:03.697 --> 17:05.029
What are you thinking?

17:05.031 --> 17:06.864
I'm thinking concrete may not have been

17:06.866 --> 17:08.366
the only factor in her death.

17:08.367 --> 17:10.835
We're looking for a white male,
30 to 40 years old,

17:10.837 --> 17:14.372
who may be performing crude
chemical lobotomies on his victims.

17:14.374 --> 17:16.874
It appears he's drilling
up through the nasal cavity

17:16.876 --> 17:20.044
in order to insert chlorine
into his victims' brains.

17:20.046 --> 17:21.212
Chlorine?

17:21.214 --> 17:23.097
Concentrated chlorine
is highly corrosive.

17:23.098 --> 17:25.683
This suggests he's trying to
destroy their frontal lobes.

17:25.685 --> 17:29.187
That area of the brain
controls impulse and inhibition.

17:29.189 --> 17:32.023
Didn't Jeffrey Dahmer want
to create sex slave zombies?

17:32.025 --> 17:35.393
Yes. And like Dahmer, he may be
looking for a way to find power

17:35.395 --> 17:36.894
and control over his victims.

17:36.896 --> 17:40.598
In this case, 30-something
single mothers with young sons.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.567
His knowledge of the dump sites

17:42.569 --> 17:44.369
indicates that he's comfortable here

17:44.371 --> 17:46.237
and likely lives or works in the area.

17:46.239 --> 17:48.072
He's probably physically fit

17:48.074 --> 17:50.959
and may drive a large van or a pickup

17:50.961 --> 17:52.410
in order to transport the drums.

17:52.412 --> 17:54.629
Reid: It's doubtful that
he has any medical training,

17:54.631 --> 17:57.215
and when his experiments fail,
he may be entombing his victims

17:57.217 --> 17:59.133
as a forensic countermeasure.

17:59.135 --> 18:02.220
The use of chlorine combined
with his masonry skills

18:02.222 --> 18:03.554
suggests he's some sort of tradesman.

18:03.556 --> 18:06.174
Let's look at
contractors, pool builders.

18:06.176 --> 18:08.259
He could also be part
of a highway road crew.

18:08.261 --> 18:09.894
The dump site area is important to him.

18:09.896 --> 18:12.397
We need your help to find out why.

18:12.399 --> 18:15.433
In the meantime, single
moms with young sons

18:15.435 --> 18:17.602
should remain vigilant.

18:17.604 --> 18:19.103
Thank you.

18:29.833 --> 18:32.250
Ah, that was a fun day, huh?

18:32.252 --> 18:35.053
Lord, I could not pry
you off those swings.

18:35.055 --> 18:38.923
You wore me out with all
your "again, Mommy, again."

18:38.925 --> 18:40.958
I don't remember.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.794
Honey, I know you're worried.

18:42.796 --> 18:44.729
I'm worried, too.

18:44.731 --> 18:47.632
Your sister has never
been gone this long before,

18:47.634 --> 18:50.552
but I'm sure she's gonna come home soon.

18:53.690 --> 18:55.139
I'm not.

18:55.141 --> 18:57.525
Listen.

18:57.527 --> 19:00.228
She's not like that anymore.

19:00.230 --> 19:02.146
She's better.

19:05.201 --> 19:10.855
You know, that's one good
thing about being adopted.

19:10.857 --> 19:12.907
I dodged the crazy gene.

19:12.909 --> 19:15.376
Oh, stop it. You know what happened.

19:15.378 --> 19:18.046
You know she couldn't help it.

19:21.167 --> 19:24.919
Dinner's almost ready.
Why don't you go change.

19:24.921 --> 19:27.055
You stink like chlorine.

19:31.311 --> 19:32.844
Hey, Rossi, the M.E. called.

19:32.846 --> 19:35.680
She said that Sharon Landon
died from the lobotomy

19:35.682 --> 19:37.482
and was entombed postmortem.

19:37.484 --> 19:40.101
The unsub was able to keep
his last two victims alive

19:40.103 --> 19:41.519
before putting them into the drums.

19:41.521 --> 19:43.354
He must be perfecting his technique.

19:43.356 --> 19:46.274
So then the concrete was likely
a forensic countermeasure,

19:46.276 --> 19:47.692
not a form of torture.

19:47.694 --> 19:49.577
It could simply be what he has on hand,

19:49.579 --> 19:51.079
what's he's comfortable with.

19:51.081 --> 19:53.781
The unsub's escalating. If
he sticks to his timetable,

19:53.783 --> 19:55.366
that means he could
be hunting right now.

19:55.368 --> 19:58.252
We need to find him before he
tries his new and improved skills

19:58.254 --> 19:59.537
on someone else.

19:59.539 --> 20:01.339
Oh.

20:01.341 --> 20:03.758
Me likey.

20:03.760 --> 20:04.759
[Beep]

20:04.761 --> 20:07.044
[Ringing]

20:07.046 --> 20:08.045
Thank you.

20:08.047 --> 20:09.297
What do you have, Garcia?

20:09.299 --> 20:12.049
So, I'm looking for workers

20:12.051 --> 20:14.569
that Malcolm Landon may
have come into contact with

20:14.571 --> 20:16.554
at the condo complex he
lived at with his mom,

20:16.556 --> 20:19.974
and it turns out that the
complexes where all 3 victims lived

20:19.976 --> 20:23.060
shared not only the same
property management company

20:23.062 --> 20:27.231
but the same cable provider,
contractors, gardeners,

20:27.233 --> 20:30.067
pool maintenance, and
security companies.

20:30.069 --> 20:32.653
Narrow the search to
employees from each complex

20:32.655 --> 20:35.072
that were working the days
the victims went missing.

20:35.074 --> 20:37.825
Well, we think the same, soul
sister, because I am currently

20:37.827 --> 20:40.828
swimming through time cards
and employment records.

20:40.830 --> 20:43.297
And by swimming, I don't mean
like the glammy olympic way.

20:43.299 --> 20:45.082
It's sort of a slog and
nothing really matches up.

20:45.084 --> 20:48.052
Well, transient workers and day
laborers often provide false IDs

20:48.054 --> 20:51.055
What about the sales of
55-gallon drums, chlorine,

20:51.057 --> 20:52.840
and the materials to make concrete?

20:52.842 --> 20:56.761
Yes. I have cross-matched that with South
Floridians who drive super duper trucks.

20:56.763 --> 20:57.762
Rossi: And?

20:57.764 --> 20:59.430
I have come up with a list

20:59.432 --> 21:02.433
that is good and plenty,
which, by the way,

21:02.435 --> 21:04.285
- Is my current favorite candy.
- It's that long?

21:04.287 --> 21:06.354
Well, yeah, but there's a lot
of housing projects going up,

21:06.356 --> 21:07.822
there's roads being paved,

21:07.824 --> 21:09.740
and it's The Sunshine State.

21:09.742 --> 21:12.026
Do you know how many pools
need to stay sparkling clean?

21:12.028 --> 21:15.413
Have you found anyone who lives or works

21:15.415 --> 21:17.665
within the geo-profile area?

21:17.667 --> 21:19.116
Uh-uh. So far with that

21:19.118 --> 21:20.835
I've come up with a big fat goose egg.

21:20.837 --> 21:22.787
Ok, Garcia, keep searching.

21:22.789 --> 21:25.456
Oh, I will leave nothing
unturned. Good-bye.

21:25.458 --> 21:28.042
All right. We profiled

21:28.044 --> 21:30.711
this guy may view the disposal sites

21:30.713 --> 21:33.798
as a cemetery, hallowed ground.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.883
It that's true, he most
likely will be compelled

21:35.885 --> 21:37.268
to revisit the area.

21:37.270 --> 21:38.469
But the drums have been removed.

21:38.471 --> 21:39.804
His victims aren't there anymore.

21:39.806 --> 21:42.106
Well, if he doesn't
live or work in the area,

21:42.108 --> 21:46.194
there's some emotional reason
he's putting the barrels there.

21:46.196 --> 21:49.230
We need to stake it out.

21:52.702 --> 21:55.953
[Crickets chirping]

21:57.373 --> 21:59.824
If I never do another stakeout again,

21:59.826 --> 22:01.242
it'll be too soon.

22:01.244 --> 22:03.794
[Chuckles] You like 'em that much, huh?

22:03.796 --> 22:05.763
Let me count the ways.

22:05.765 --> 22:08.833
The ass-numbing boredom,

22:08.835 --> 22:11.636
the greasy fast food, the cold coffee,

22:11.638 --> 22:15.473
and may I tell you how much
I hate peeing in the woods.

22:15.475 --> 22:19.343
[Laughing] Yeah, I hear you.
I could see that about you.

22:19.345 --> 22:20.978
See what?

22:20.980 --> 22:23.147
You like things a certain way.

22:23.149 --> 22:26.851
Hmm? You want control.

22:26.853 --> 22:29.153
That's cool.
Everybody's got their thing.

22:29.155 --> 22:33.975
I see somebody as been studying
his behavioral analysis manual.

22:33.977 --> 22:37.562
[Laughs] Oh, I don't need
a manual to profile you.

22:37.564 --> 22:40.248
Knock yourself out.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.449
[Exhales]

22:41.451 --> 22:43.784
You are definitely an East Coast girl.

22:43.786 --> 22:48.923
Mm-hmm. Not Boston, Philly, um...

22:48.925 --> 22:54.378
Not New York. Bronx born
and raised. I think I'd know.

22:54.380 --> 22:57.448
I'm gonna say you're from D.C.

22:57.450 --> 22:58.883
You read my file.

22:58.885 --> 23:00.868
No. Cross my heart, I didn't.

23:00.870 --> 23:03.054
You're comfortable working
overseas, which means

23:03.056 --> 23:07.224
you could have traveled
around a lot as a kid.

23:07.226 --> 23:10.227
Or maybe your parents were diplomats,

23:10.229 --> 23:14.398
or maybe a military brat.

23:14.400 --> 23:16.317
How am I doing?

23:19.939 --> 23:21.038
You suck.

23:21.040 --> 23:22.373
[Laughs]

23:22.375 --> 23:24.742
I mean, yeah, you were right about D.C.

23:24.744 --> 23:28.829
And, yeah, my parents were diplomats.

23:28.831 --> 23:30.464
And you guessed military brat.

23:30.466 --> 23:32.633
But you're ex-army, right?

23:32.635 --> 23:35.419
Oh, yeah, that's right.

23:35.421 --> 23:37.054
So why the army?

23:38.257 --> 23:41.759
My dad served, and I
was always proud of that.

23:41.761 --> 23:43.611
I wanted to serve my country, too.

23:43.613 --> 23:46.681
Were you in Afghanistan?

23:46.683 --> 23:48.432
Mm-mm. Iraq.

23:48.434 --> 23:51.652
What unit were you with?

23:51.654 --> 23:55.439
I was with the 75th Ranger Regiment.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.076
Wow.

23:59.078 --> 24:00.077
Yeah.

24:00.079 --> 24:01.979
The 75th, huh?

24:03.082 --> 24:04.865
Yeah.

24:04.867 --> 24:08.119
Oh, I forgot one thing
about you, Prentiss.

24:08.121 --> 24:11.956
You are definitely a cat person.

24:11.958 --> 24:14.258
[Laughs] Yeah.

24:18.931 --> 24:22.049
Got a Florida plate.

24:22.051 --> 24:25.136
Garcia, I need you to
run a license plate.

24:25.138 --> 24:28.472
8-Bravo-Romeo-6-9-0-4.

24:28.474 --> 24:31.609
Can't make out who's driving.

24:34.013 --> 24:36.414
Belongs to a local contractor.

24:40.436 --> 24:42.820
[Woman screaming]

24:51.547 --> 24:52.713
Alvez: Freeze right there!

24:52.715 --> 24:53.831
Move. Move back.

24:53.833 --> 24:55.383
Don't shoot, please.

24:55.385 --> 24:57.835
I was just getting a blanket.

25:03.726 --> 25:05.843
Alvez: Whose truck is this?

25:05.845 --> 25:07.511
It... it's my dad's.

25:07.513 --> 25:09.680
He let me borrow it, I swear.

25:09.682 --> 25:12.433
What are you two doing way out here?

25:12.435 --> 25:13.834
What are you doing out here?

25:17.156 --> 25:19.340
Ok, get out of here.

25:19.342 --> 25:20.691
Go home.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.326
Get out of here.

25:23.579 --> 25:24.745
[Engine starts]

25:24.747 --> 25:26.113
Time to call it.

25:26.115 --> 25:27.448
He knows we're out here.

25:31.370 --> 25:35.339
Sounds like you spoiled a
romantic evening for those kids.

25:35.341 --> 25:37.508
JJ: So the unsub's disposal area

25:37.510 --> 25:38.959
is a lovers lane?

25:38.961 --> 25:41.212
Why dump the body of grown women

25:41.214 --> 25:43.297
in a place used by horny teenagers?

25:43.299 --> 25:45.599
Probably the same reason they go there.

25:45.601 --> 25:46.851
It's secluded, private.

25:46.853 --> 25:48.886
Well, if the unsub took girls
there when he was younger,

25:48.888 --> 25:50.521
it would explain how he knows the area

25:50.523 --> 25:52.056
and why it would mean something to him.

25:52.058 --> 25:54.225
Maybe he had his first
sexual experience there.

25:54.227 --> 25:55.810
Maybe the first time didn't go so well.

25:55.812 --> 25:59.196
Lobotomies might be his way of
creating a willing sexual partner.

25:59.198 --> 26:01.866
Or, he could have
recently started dating

26:01.868 --> 26:03.784
a single mother with a son.

26:03.786 --> 26:06.904
If she mocked or rejected his sexual
advances, this could be payback.

26:06.906 --> 26:08.989
Whatever the reason, we
have made it impossible

26:08.991 --> 26:10.624
for him to return to the site,

26:10.626 --> 26:13.077
so, he's probably angry.

26:13.079 --> 26:15.613
Most likely he will devolve.

26:43.776 --> 26:46.110
Stuart, did you break that?

26:46.112 --> 26:47.545
Shut up.

26:47.865 --> 26:51.116
I didn't raise you to
speak to me that way.

26:51.118 --> 26:54.169
No, you raised me to believe
there were consequences

26:54.171 --> 26:55.754
for my actions.

26:55.756 --> 26:57.790
You taught me about accountability

26:57.792 --> 27:01.627
and responsibility, honesty.

27:01.629 --> 27:05.464
When are you gonna tell the truth?

27:05.466 --> 27:06.932
Truth about what?

27:06.934 --> 27:08.717
I can't do this anymore.

27:08.719 --> 27:11.103
Do what? You're not making sense. I...

27:11.105 --> 27:12.187
Why did you adopt me?

27:12.189 --> 27:15.107
Why on earth are you
asking that right now?

27:15.109 --> 27:17.392
Why?!

27:17.394 --> 27:20.112
When my husband died,
I wanted another child.

27:20.114 --> 27:21.613
I...

27:22.783 --> 27:25.818
God answered my prayers. I got you.

27:25.820 --> 27:28.787
But that's not the whole story, is it?

27:28.789 --> 27:30.456
You know the story.

27:32.910 --> 27:35.210
Look, I'm tired. It's late.

27:35.212 --> 27:37.329
I'm exhausted and I'm going to bed.

27:37.331 --> 27:39.381
I just want the truth. I
want to hear you say it!

27:39.383 --> 27:40.582
Aah!

27:49.440 --> 27:51.300
_

27:51.659 --> 27:54.493
So we said the unsub may be performing

27:54.495 --> 27:56.161
the lobotomies on his victims

27:56.163 --> 27:58.246
to manipulate their inhibitions.

27:58.248 --> 27:59.831
People who experience
frontal lobe damage

27:59.833 --> 28:02.467
often become aggressive,
with heightened sex drives.

28:02.469 --> 28:05.504
He may want to alter the
sexual behavior of his victims.

28:05.506 --> 28:07.539
Yeah, but when he
becomes bored with them

28:07.541 --> 28:09.341
or the women don't do
what he wants them to do,

28:09.343 --> 28:11.443
then he moves on to the next victim.

28:11.445 --> 28:13.061
Thank you so much.
Guys, that was the M.E.

28:13.063 --> 28:14.980
She's completed her
exams on all 3 victims

28:14.982 --> 28:17.082
and found no sign of sexual assault.

28:25.909 --> 28:28.026
[Gasps]

28:28.028 --> 28:30.328
Why are you doing this?

28:34.535 --> 28:37.803
Stuart, answer me, please!

28:37.805 --> 28:43.208
So, I was adopted because
you wanted another child.

28:43.210 --> 28:45.544
That's what I said, yes.

28:45.546 --> 28:47.796
Now, untie me!

28:47.798 --> 28:49.548
Not until you tell the truth.

28:50.851 --> 28:52.384
Even though there was no sexual assault,

28:52.386 --> 28:57.189
the use of a lovers lane as a dump
site suggests a sexual component.

28:57.191 --> 28:59.725
And the lobotomies are still
probably the unsub's way

28:59.727 --> 29:01.560
of exerting control over his victims.

29:01.562 --> 29:03.361
It could go back to his childhood.

29:03.363 --> 29:05.363
He's trying to gain a
control he never had.

29:05.365 --> 29:08.650
It seems primitive now,
but in the 1940s and '50s,

29:08.652 --> 29:12.287
cutting portions of the brain
was believed to rid a patient

29:12.289 --> 29:14.239
of delusions, nervousness.

29:14.241 --> 29:17.159
Instead, most of those patients
experienced loss of memory,

29:17.161 --> 29:18.560
motor skills, and language.

29:18.562 --> 29:21.246
That happened to JFK's
older sister Rosemary.

29:21.248 --> 29:23.215
She suffered brain damage at birth.

29:23.217 --> 29:27.002
At 23, her father secretly arranged
to have doctors perform a lobotomy.

29:27.004 --> 29:29.221
It was a misguided attempt
to control mood swings

29:29.223 --> 29:31.389
and sexual behavior.

29:31.391 --> 29:32.507
Rossi: Maybe,

29:32.509 --> 29:34.426
instead of trying to turn on

29:34.428 --> 29:36.344
his victims' sexuality,

29:36.346 --> 29:40.148
our guy is trying to
turn the switch off.

29:42.686 --> 29:45.937
You wanted to know about your adoption.

29:45.939 --> 29:50.275
Ok, I will. Your...

29:50.277 --> 29:53.278
Your birth mother wasn't able to...

29:53.280 --> 29:55.247
To raise you.

29:55.249 --> 29:56.832
So she did the right thing.

29:56.834 --> 29:58.917
You were only a few days old

29:58.919 --> 30:02.120
and I... I adopted you
and brought you home.

30:02.122 --> 30:03.622
To our happy little family.

30:03.624 --> 30:06.258
I admit it was difficult.

30:06.260 --> 30:07.759
I was a single mother.

30:07.761 --> 30:09.261
Your sister was acting out.

30:09.263 --> 30:10.962
I... I tried to control her.

30:10.964 --> 30:13.298
But you didn't try hard enough.

30:14.968 --> 30:16.518
You see something, Spence?

30:16.520 --> 30:17.636
It's what Rossi said.

30:17.638 --> 30:19.888
What if the unsub is
deliberately damaging

30:19.890 --> 30:22.974
his victims' brains in his own
misguided hope of fixing them?

30:22.976 --> 30:24.476
He targets single moms.

30:24.478 --> 30:27.062
He could be trying to cure
them of their sexuality.

30:27.064 --> 30:29.531
To turn them into what he considers

30:29.533 --> 30:31.783
to be good, well-behaved mothers.

30:31.785 --> 30:33.952
So most likely his own mother

30:33.954 --> 30:37.239
or another woman close
to him has brain damage.

30:37.241 --> 30:38.957
Garcia, we need your help.

30:38.959 --> 30:40.242
Fire when ready.

30:40.244 --> 30:44.329
We are looking for local women
who have or have been treated

30:44.331 --> 30:47.215
for a brain injury or disorder.

30:47.217 --> 30:48.633
I have 19 names.

30:48.635 --> 30:50.168
Well, he's targeting
women in their mid-30s.

30:50.170 --> 30:53.038
How many fall into that category?

30:53.040 --> 30:55.590
3 women suffered traumatic brain injury

30:55.592 --> 30:58.260
and all due to accidents.
I have a car crash,

30:58.262 --> 31:00.929
fall off a horse, and
a surfing incident.

31:00.931 --> 31:03.515
Any of them have damage
to the frontal lobe?

31:03.517 --> 31:07.702
One. Lynelle Barker,
36, of West Palm Beach.

31:07.704 --> 31:10.605
When she was 15, she was in a car crash

31:10.607 --> 31:12.607
that killed her father, Edward Barker.

31:12.609 --> 31:13.892
She wasn't wearing her seat belt.

31:13.894 --> 31:15.193
Soon after that, she was diagnosed

31:15.195 --> 31:17.412
with something called
Kluver‐Bucy Syndrome.

31:17.414 --> 31:20.031
Kluver‐Bucy Syndrome
is a neurological disorder

31:20.033 --> 31:21.533
associated with frontal lobe damage.

31:21.535 --> 31:24.369
One of its major symptoms
is hypersexuality.

31:24.371 --> 31:26.254
Lynelle would dress provocatively.

31:26.256 --> 31:28.073
She'd sneak out of
the house at all hours.

31:28.075 --> 31:32.260
The school was calling saying she's
kissing boys and rubbing up against them.

31:32.262 --> 31:34.713
She was always disappearing.

31:34.715 --> 31:37.465
She always came back.

31:37.467 --> 31:43.271
I don't know why she's gone now, but...

31:43.273 --> 31:45.056
I know she's gonna come home,

31:45.058 --> 31:49.060
and the 3 of us, we will
sit down and we'll talk.

31:50.264 --> 31:52.397
She's never coming back.

32:01.875 --> 32:05.493
If Lynelle Barker was
acting out sexually,

32:05.495 --> 32:08.163
she may have a husband or a
boyfriend who was upset about it.

32:08.165 --> 32:10.498
Garcia, was she getting
treatment for her condition?

32:10.500 --> 32:13.585
Yeah, a month ago she started seeing
a therapist and taking medication.

32:13.587 --> 32:16.087
That's when Sharon Landon,
the first victim, went missing.

32:16.089 --> 32:18.089
If the victims were
surrogates of Lynelle

32:18.091 --> 32:21.092
and she was no longer
hypersexual thanks to treatment,

32:21.094 --> 32:23.612
why would the unsub
suddenly start killing?

32:23.614 --> 32:27.182
Garcia, can you check males 35 to 40

32:27.184 --> 32:29.234
that would have been in Lynelle's
circle of family and friends?

32:29.236 --> 32:30.235
Bien sûr, je peux.

32:30.237 --> 32:32.187
The lovers lane, the crude lobotomies,

32:32.189 --> 32:33.989
the possible sexual dysfunction...

32:33.991 --> 32:35.774
This could all speak
to the unsub's youth.

32:35.776 --> 32:38.610
Garcia, refine your search

32:38.612 --> 32:41.446
to men between 18 and 25.

32:41.448 --> 32:43.531
Refining.

32:43.533 --> 32:46.501
Lynelle has a 20-year-old
brother named Stuart.

32:46.503 --> 32:48.954
He lives with his mother
in West Palm Beach.

32:48.956 --> 32:51.456
16 years is a big age
difference between siblings.

32:51.458 --> 32:53.625
Oh. That's because Stuart was adopted.

32:53.627 --> 32:59.798
Gloria barker adopted him a year
after Lynelle and Gloria's husband

32:59.800 --> 33:02.550
were in that car crash.

33:02.552 --> 33:03.768
And brace yourselves,

33:03.770 --> 33:05.854
because methinks I'm about to uncover

33:05.856 --> 33:08.690
some family dirt of the hidden variety.

33:08.692 --> 33:12.560
Ok, just days before
Gloria adopted Stuart,

33:12.562 --> 33:14.729
Lynelle, Gloria's daughter,

33:14.731 --> 33:16.881
then 16, had a baby.

33:16.883 --> 33:19.651
And I am prying open the
sealed adoption records now.

33:19.653 --> 33:21.252
And, um...

33:21.254 --> 33:22.487
Yeah, guess what.

33:22.489 --> 33:23.822
Stuart's sister is actually his mother.

33:23.824 --> 33:25.123
Garcia: Uh-huh.

33:25.125 --> 33:26.741
And the woman he thought was his mother

33:26.743 --> 33:28.543
is actually his grandmother.

33:28.545 --> 33:32.297
Guys, Stuart does repairs at a
place called Blue Breeze Pools,

33:32.299 --> 33:34.466
that have worked at
all 3 condo complexes.

33:34.468 --> 33:38.837
Was he working the days
the victims disappeared?

33:38.839 --> 33:39.804
Yahtzee! Go get him.

33:39.806 --> 33:41.673
Send us his home and work addresses.

33:41.675 --> 33:43.341
Oh, newbie, already sent.

33:54.321 --> 33:56.521
[Gasps] Oh, no!

33:56.523 --> 33:58.523
Please, Stuart, you're hurting me!

33:58.525 --> 33:59.691
You know why?

33:59.693 --> 34:02.193
You're a bad mother.

34:02.195 --> 34:04.412
Or should I say grandmother?

34:04.414 --> 34:05.697
That's right.

34:05.699 --> 34:07.032
She told me.

34:08.568 --> 34:12.003
I've been hoping one day you'd
want to come here with me.

34:12.005 --> 34:15.255
Oh. No, uh, Stuart, we...

34:15.257 --> 34:18.043
No, it's ok. See, we're
not actually related

34:18.045 --> 34:19.627
if you think about it.

34:19.629 --> 34:21.212
Well, not biologically, anyway.

34:21.214 --> 34:23.848
Stuart, we're here
because we have to talk.

34:23.850 --> 34:27.851
And this was the only place I could
think of where we'd have some privacy.

34:27.853 --> 34:29.853
I don't want to talk.

34:29.856 --> 34:31.389
I want you.

34:31.391 --> 34:33.558
I've wanted you for so long.

34:33.560 --> 34:34.726
Stop, Stuart, stop. Stop it!

34:34.728 --> 34:38.696
Why? Why are you acting
so prim and proper with me?

34:38.697 --> 34:42.984
I mean... you've had sex with
a lot of guys. I've seen you.

34:42.985 --> 34:45.703
You've been watching me?

34:45.705 --> 34:49.456
You... you've slept with all my friends.

34:49.458 --> 34:52.710
Do you know how that makes me feel?

34:52.712 --> 34:54.411
Damn it, why not me?

34:54.414 --> 34:56.714
Stuart, you're my son.

34:56.716 --> 34:58.083
What?

35:00.253 --> 35:04.389
When I was 16...

35:04.391 --> 35:07.258
I got pregnant and I had you.

35:07.260 --> 35:10.311
No. No, that... That's not true.

35:10.313 --> 35:12.230
You're my son.

35:13.767 --> 35:15.150
I'm so sorry.

35:15.152 --> 35:17.852
Don't touch me!

35:17.854 --> 35:20.105
All this time you lied to me.

35:20.107 --> 35:21.239
You and her.

35:21.241 --> 35:23.108
It was the only way.

35:23.110 --> 35:25.743
No. No, you should
have told me the truth.

35:25.745 --> 35:27.162
You should've told me the truth!

35:27.164 --> 35:28.413
You talked to her?

35:28.415 --> 35:30.365
She said she wasn't coming back.

35:30.367 --> 35:33.201
Did you fight about that,
about how she was before?

35:33.203 --> 35:35.086
No. I didn't fight with my mom

35:35.088 --> 35:36.955
because she had sex with all those men.

35:36.957 --> 35:38.456
No.

35:38.458 --> 35:41.126
I killed her because she
wouldn't have sex with me.

35:41.128 --> 35:42.794
[Sobbing]

35:48.952 --> 35:52.437
[Metal clanking]

35:52.439 --> 35:55.874
[Gasping]

35:55.876 --> 35:56.875
[Crying]

35:59.192 --> 36:00.542
[Siren]

36:01.569 --> 36:04.653
If Stuart believed he had
an older, hypersexual sister

36:04.655 --> 36:08.561
he wasn't biologically related to,
he might have been attracted to her.

36:08.561 --> 36:11.757
He may have convinced himself that it
wouldn't be wrong to sleep with her.

36:11.917 --> 36:12.964
But what about Lynelle?

36:12.964 --> 36:14.703
Would she really have
encouraged her own son?

36:14.740 --> 36:17.491
The taboo of incest is believed
to be hard-wired in our DNA.

36:17.493 --> 36:20.160
Even with Kluver-Bucy, it's unlikely
she would have crossed that line.

36:20.162 --> 36:22.362
Which could have enraged Stuart.

36:22.364 --> 36:24.781
Talk about a traumatized love map.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.366
If he found out the
truth about his sister,

36:26.368 --> 36:29.536
that could be a trigger
for the killings.

36:29.538 --> 36:32.372
[Crying]

36:32.374 --> 36:35.876
I wanted to have sex with my own mother.

36:35.878 --> 36:38.595
Don't you see how wrong that was?

36:38.597 --> 36:41.131
I didn't know. I swear.

36:41.133 --> 36:42.382
But you knew what she was like.

36:42.384 --> 36:43.717
You should have protected me.

36:43.719 --> 36:45.936
A mother protects her child.

36:45.938 --> 36:48.272
I was protecting you.

36:48.274 --> 36:50.224
Oh, no. No, no, no!

36:50.226 --> 36:52.893
She just wasn't fit to
be a mother. Don't you...

36:52.895 --> 36:56.029
Can't you see it was better this way?

36:56.031 --> 36:58.899
You should have told
me the truth years ago.

36:58.901 --> 37:02.035
Please don't do this.

37:02.037 --> 37:04.071
We both love you.

37:04.073 --> 37:05.405
That's good.

37:05.407 --> 37:06.573
[Crying]

37:06.575 --> 37:08.408
'Cause you're gonna be together forever.

37:08.410 --> 37:13.130
No! No! [Sobbing]

37:13.132 --> 37:14.414
No!

37:14.416 --> 37:16.300
I'm standing on her right now.

37:16.302 --> 37:18.001
[Sobbing]

37:27.096 --> 37:28.395
[Sobbing]

37:28.397 --> 37:31.398
Help!

37:31.400 --> 37:32.532
Help!

37:38.774 --> 37:41.074
Help me!

37:41.076 --> 37:43.410
Help!

37:44.997 --> 37:46.964
FBI! Stay where you are!

37:46.966 --> 37:48.949
Go!

37:55.124 --> 37:57.341
Uhh!

37:57.343 --> 37:59.459
You're under arrest.

37:59.461 --> 38:01.628
Stuart Barker, you have
the right to remain silent.

38:01.630 --> 38:04.514
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.133
You have the right to an attorney.

38:07.937 --> 38:11.521
[Sobbing]

38:11.523 --> 38:13.974
You're all right. You're all right.

38:13.976 --> 38:16.643
[Sobbing] Oh, god.

38:16.645 --> 38:17.477
Look at me. Look at me.

38:17.479 --> 38:18.528
Oh, no...

38:18.530 --> 38:20.280
You're all right. It's ok.

38:20.282 --> 38:21.481
It's ok. It's ok.

38:21.483 --> 38:22.482
[Sobbing]

38:22.484 --> 38:24.201
It's ok.

38:24.203 --> 38:25.485
It's ok.

38:28.107 --> 38:31.325
Hey, Alvez, we're heading over
to O'Keefe's. Do you want to come?

38:31.327 --> 38:33.710
Thanks. I've got some
work I want to finish up.

38:33.712 --> 38:35.796
All right, let's get
this show on the road.

38:35.798 --> 38:38.832
This lady needs to get her drink on.

38:39.969 --> 38:42.169
Not that I need a drink.

38:42.171 --> 38:44.388
On occasion I have one, maybe two.

38:44.390 --> 38:46.256
3 if it's not a school night,

38:46.258 --> 38:48.058
and not on an empty stomach,
and not when I drive.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.726
I don't drink and drive.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.178
Did I say anything?

38:51.180 --> 38:52.929
No. I just... I don't want to feel

38:52.931 --> 38:55.148
your Judgy McJudgerson looks on me

38:55.150 --> 38:56.350
as I daintily sip my Mai Tai.

38:56.352 --> 38:57.851
Hey, he's not joining us.

38:57.853 --> 39:00.187
Ok, in that case, never mind.

39:00.189 --> 39:01.488
Stay safe, ladies.

39:01.490 --> 39:04.191
Uh, guys, you know what?
I need another 30 seconds

39:04.193 --> 39:05.359
and then we're out of here, I promise.

39:05.361 --> 39:06.610
All right, we'll see
you at the elevators.

39:06.612 --> 39:08.278
- JJ: Good night, Luke.
- Good night.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.197
You know why I don't
think he goes out with us?

39:10.199 --> 39:12.532
It involves someone named Roxy.

39:12.534 --> 39:14.001
Roxy? Do tell.

39:14.003 --> 39:17.654
Hey. Nice work today.

39:17.656 --> 39:20.040
Thanks. You, too.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.009
Prentiss.

39:22.011 --> 39:23.543
Oh, you change your mind?

39:23.545 --> 39:26.797
No. Uh, you know, on the stakeout,

39:26.799 --> 39:29.216
you know, about me being in the 75th?

39:29.218 --> 39:32.002
Well, I was just, uh...

39:32.004 --> 39:35.188
I was hoping we could
keep that between us.

39:35.190 --> 39:36.390
Sure.

39:36.392 --> 39:37.557
Thanks.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.818
Alvez: "Three things
cannot long stay hidden."

39:47.820 --> 39:50.237
"The sun, the moon,

39:50.239 --> 39:52.072
and the truth."

39:52.074 --> 39:53.540
Buddha.
