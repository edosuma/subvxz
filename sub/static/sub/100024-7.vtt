00:01.044 --> 00:03.003
Welcome to my palace, Sir David.

00:03.046 --> 00:04.700
Damn, this is the life.

00:04.743 --> 00:06.397
You invited David to church?

00:06.441 --> 00:08.617
He's singing his first solo
in the men's day celebration.

00:08.660 --> 00:09.835
You have to come.

00:09.879 --> 00:12.664
We see what's
special about Seren.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.884
-You've gotta tell somebody.
-Who?

00:14.927 --> 00:16.712
[Tio] I want to
start you off small.

00:16.755 --> 00:18.018
These are just samples.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.062
But I want to know if the people

00:19.106 --> 00:20.759
in the Ville will bite.

00:20.803 --> 00:23.458
Tell your uncle no disrespect
but I'm not interested.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.982
-You paid rent.
-Yeah, so I took care of it.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.158
-Where were you?
-Right here!

00:28.202 --> 00:29.507
Trying to get unemployment

00:29.551 --> 00:31.074
so we don't end
up on the streets.

00:31.118 --> 00:32.728
What's this?

00:34.251 --> 00:36.601
Why did you want
extra sessions, David?

00:41.171 --> 00:43.260
[Sky] Once you make your
choice, David,

00:43.304 --> 00:44.827
you gotta live with it.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.831

[man] Hey, man,
why you cheifin'? Come on.

01:10.461 --> 01:11.549
What?

01:11.593 --> 01:13.551
'Cause it's my weed.
Fuck you mean?

01:13.595 --> 01:15.466
Nigga, fuck you,
I smoked you out last week.

01:15.510 --> 01:18.861
Hey, man, don't nobody
want that, Reggie.

01:18.904 --> 01:20.776
Shit gave me a damn headache.

01:20.819 --> 01:23.605
You can take them seasoned
stems back to the flower shop.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.259
[laughs] ASAP.

01:25.302 --> 01:26.695
-[coughs]
-Yeah, yeah.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.305
Good, good, I hope
you fucking choke, Stingy-ass.

01:28.349 --> 01:29.785
Hey nigga, ain't you
supposed to be up top?

01:29.828 --> 01:32.222
-Oh, shit.
-This ain't no tag team sport.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.050
This ain't Wrestlemania, dog.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.399
Dog, dog, you got to lighten.

01:35.443 --> 01:38.098
Your boy ain't here
like it's is your job.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.274
[David] Hey, Nobi.

01:40.839 --> 01:41.927
David?

01:41.971 --> 01:43.233
[David] Is Sky up there?

01:43.277 --> 01:44.582
Man, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:44.626 --> 01:47.237
Telling the whole
'hood his whereabouts?

01:47.281 --> 01:48.978
There's a system in
place for a reason.

01:49.021 --> 01:50.719
[Sky] Hey, hey.

01:50.762 --> 01:54.026
Ain't no need to be
a lion to a lamb, man.

01:54.070 --> 01:55.289
We can't have him
running his mouth

01:55.332 --> 01:56.812
and putting all the
business on the front.

01:56.855 --> 01:58.248
[Sky] I know.

01:58.901 --> 02:00.598
Go find some calm.

02:06.909 --> 02:09.129
[slow music playing]

02:23.230 --> 02:25.362
What I'd tell you
about next moves, huh?

02:25.406 --> 02:27.495
Never let anyone know them.

02:27.538 --> 02:31.673
So what would that infer
about one's current locale?

02:37.200 --> 02:38.854
[laughs]

02:44.164 --> 02:45.643
Hey, keep a lookout.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.645
[Man] Yo, where you going, G?

[ominous music playing]

03:09.319 --> 03:11.321
Hey yo,
Dai wants you downstairs.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.193
So tell him to come up then.

03:17.371 --> 03:18.981
[man] All right,
little man, let's go.

03:19.024 --> 03:20.156
[boy] Why I gotta go?

03:20.200 --> 03:21.766
Where the boss go, you go.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.464
You know?

03:24.595 --> 03:25.944
Come on.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.817
[muffled rap music playing]

03:31.559 --> 03:35.215
[David] Okay, so this one
comes in .25 milligrams.

03:35.258 --> 03:36.694
Goes up to three milligrams but

03:36.738 --> 03:38.914
three milligrams is a lot, so,

03:38.957 --> 03:40.611
don't go past one.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.265
But you can say
three times a day.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.875
-Yo, that's crazy.
-[cell phone rings]

03:43.919 --> 03:45.225
Why not...

03:45.268 --> 03:47.183
three milligrams
three times a day,

03:47.227 --> 03:48.619
then we chop them into ones,

03:48.663 --> 03:50.055
and then we'll have nine.

03:50.099 --> 03:52.362
Nah, because they'll
call the police.

03:52.406 --> 03:53.885
But Benzos is almost
the same thing.

03:53.929 --> 03:56.627
And that goes up to
ten milligrams four times a day.

03:56.671 --> 03:59.326
Right, only it's
not the same thing.

03:59.369 --> 04:01.937
Look, if you prescribe
40 milligram of Zannies a day,

04:01.980 --> 04:04.592
the pharmacy would
definitely call the police.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.376

04:06.420 --> 04:07.725
[speaks in foreign language]

04:07.769 --> 04:09.161
Look, Tio ain't here
holding your hand

04:09.205 --> 04:10.293
with these samples no more.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.947
This shit all on us.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.992
You fuck around, somebody
might die or go to jail.

04:14.036 --> 04:16.343
-Shit, or both.
-[phone continues ringing]

04:16.386 --> 04:18.301
If that happens,
Tio Teo would definitely

04:18.345 --> 04:19.737
know before we want him to.

04:19.781 --> 04:22.000
So, make sure you don't
tell him until it works.

04:22.044 --> 04:23.437
You gonna get that?

04:24.742 --> 04:27.136
Look, so, basically,
anything with Benzo is--

04:27.179 --> 04:30.270
[phone ringing]

04:32.794 --> 04:34.535
Yeah, what's up?

04:35.666 --> 04:36.885
Yeah.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.279
I'm coming.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.976
Yes, I did.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.717
Yeah, after school.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.980
Yeah, eight.

04:45.023 --> 04:46.590
I'll remember.

04:47.374 --> 04:50.594
I know. No, no, it's cool.

04:50.638 --> 04:52.857
I'll be there,
I promise, I'll be there.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.598
Hey G, you better be
talking to a bitch,

04:54.642 --> 04:56.296

04:57.166 --> 04:58.950
Okay.

Okay.

this over with.

Nobi's gotta dip soon.

05:16.098 --> 05:17.447
Okay, so let him dip.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.797
Real G's are supposed
to move in silence anyway.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.625
Why you wanna let everybody
know the business?

05:21.669 --> 05:23.671
Who you calling everybody?

05:23.714 --> 05:25.281

fucking head open,

Yo. Yo. Chill.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.460

05:32.070 --> 05:33.071
Right.

05:33.115 --> 05:34.203
On my momma, I swear to God--

It's not a big deal, Mom.

06:33.262 --> 06:35.046
I said, it's not
a big deal, Mom.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.439
But it's Halloween.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.398
It's a sin to go to
church on Halloween.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.225
It's Seren's solo.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.531

love a spooky surprise?

all the time but

08:37.386 --> 08:39.562
obviously he's outgrown that.

08:39.606 --> 08:40.737
Right, Seren?

08:40.781 --> 08:42.260
[Ray] That's one way to put it.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.567

real damage to your mom.
-Ray.

now an extreme issue

Mass shootings have almost
become a norm in America,

boils down to.

Deacon Harris asked me

11:29.340 --> 11:32.822
if I would even acknowledge

this is another day for
us to worship our Savior

11:40.787 --> 11:42.353
and be reminded...

11:42.397 --> 11:45.748
that no ghost, no ghoul,

that it was His duty
