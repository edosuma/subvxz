WEBVTT

00:02.252 --> 00:03.992
- Previously on Haven...

00:04.129 --> 00:05.414
- [grunts]

00:05.547 --> 00:07.162
- It's the troubles,
isn't it?

00:07.299 --> 00:09.381
- Maybe it's some kind
of cosmic test of our character.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.875
- You seriously can't feel pain?
- No.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.672
- There are
two different Havens.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.669
There's the one that's
right beneath the surface,

00:14.806 --> 00:16.546
and then there's the one
right underneath that.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.799
You, Nathan,
you live in both Havens.

00:18.936 --> 00:20.676
You remember that woman
that I look like?

00:20.812 --> 00:22.677
- In the Colorado Kid pic?
- Yeah.

00:22.814 --> 00:25.601
Do you think there's a chance
that her name could be Lucy?

00:25.734 --> 00:26.849
- Could we pick this up later?

00:26.985 --> 00:28.566
- Hey, Duke.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.606
- On the menu this evening
is a grilled tiger shrimp.

00:30.739 --> 00:32.275
- Dinner, Friday night.
Right.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.193
- Don't even think
about canceling on me, woman.

00:34.326 --> 00:35.907
- When I couldn't
make our dinner,

00:36.036 --> 00:37.901
you met up with somebody else,
didn't you?

00:38.038 --> 00:39.653
I don't think I had friends.
But I do now.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.030
And so do you.

00:46.797 --> 00:49.789
[boat engine humming]

00:53.053 --> 00:55.715
[sighs]

01:04.106 --> 01:06.142
Seriously,
you dragged me out of bed

01:06.275 --> 01:08.812
at 8:00 am. on a Saturday
to watch you meditate?

01:08.944 --> 01:12.107
- [sighs]

01:12.239 --> 01:13.729
Audrey, it's gonna take us
a little while

01:13.865 --> 01:15.071
to get where we're going.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.440
Just relax.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.246
- Can you just tell me
where we're going?

01:22.374 --> 01:23.910
I know. I know.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.158
You can't explain it.
You have to show it to me.

01:26.295 --> 01:29.412
Okay, then just tell me
what this is about.

01:29.548 --> 01:33.006
ls--is this
about the troubles?

01:33.135 --> 01:36.093
- Buddha says all good things
come to those who wait.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.882
- Yeah, does Buddha
also say,

01:38.015 --> 01:40.848
"Drink, smuggle, and always
look out for number one"?

01:40.976 --> 01:42.466
- I'm a reformed Buddhist.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.218
- Can't you just tell me
where we're going?

01:44.354 --> 01:45.935
I don't understand.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.183
- It's called Carpenter's Knot.

01:51.320 --> 01:55.029
It's been in the Carpenter
family since forever.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.489
The last of the Carpenters
is kind of a hermit.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.324
You know,
he closed down the hotel

01:59.453 --> 02:01.284
and pulled up the red carpet
when l was a kid.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.153
- Hmm.

02:03.290 --> 02:07.249
- Now, I hear that the grounds
and resorts are very special.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.333
- You hear?

02:09.463 --> 02:12.830
You said you saw something
that you had to show me.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.831
- Oh. Well, I may have
embellished about that.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.208
- Yeah.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.687
- [grunts]

02:29.816 --> 02:32.102
Practically smell the history,
can't you?

02:32.235 --> 02:34.362
- Yeah, I can smell something.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.315
This place
gives me the creeps.

02:50.796 --> 02:54.129
All right, now are you
gonna tell me why--

02:54.257 --> 02:55.588
[screams]

02:55.717 --> 02:57.878
- Surprise!
- Happy birthday!

03:00.472 --> 03:01.712
- You...

03:03.725 --> 03:04.885
- Got ya.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.554
- Did you see her face?
It was so--

03:06.687 --> 03:08.723
Very effective.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.392
That was priceless!

03:11.525 --> 03:13.356
- Are you crying?

03:13.485 --> 03:14.850
- No.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.317
- Crying will not
be tolerated today.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.947
- Shut up!
I am still armed.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.483
[laughs]

03:19.616 --> 03:22.028
Nobody's ever thrown me
a birthday party before,

03:22.160 --> 03:24.196
so it's--
it's pretty awesome.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.115
- Well, after all you've
already done for Haven,

03:26.248 --> 03:27.533
it's the least
we could do.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.076
- I never even
expected it.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.416
I didn't even know
you guys were plan--

03:31.545 --> 03:33.831
I didn't even expect it
from the girl I don't even know.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.454
Hello.
- Julia Carr.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.672
I'm Eleanor's daughter.
I just got back in town.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.087
- She was in Ethiopia
with the Peace Corps.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.257
- Well, Darfur, actually,
with Doctors Without Borders.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.051
- Well, thank you.
Thank you for coming.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.559
- Well, I brought
margarita mix.

03:46.685 --> 03:47.970
- Will you marry me, please?

03:48.103 --> 03:49.388
- [laughs]

03:49.521 --> 03:51.432
- Julia here
had the biggest crush on me

03:51.565 --> 03:53.430
when she was just
a wee lass.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.933
- Please, I put up
with your hipster chin fuzz

03:56.069 --> 03:57.684
so you'd tell me
cool traveling stories.

03:57.821 --> 04:00.062
- She loved me.

04:01.283 --> 04:03.194
I'm gonna...

04:03.326 --> 04:04.611
- Bellhop's here.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.986
- Oh, are these all for me?
- Mm-hmm.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.703
- Which one did you get me?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.462
- This box.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.919
It's, uh, shiny.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.332
- Thanks for coming.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.002
I know you're not really
in a party mood.

04:19.134 --> 04:20.499
- I wouldn't miss it.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.546
- I was worried about you
after Jess. l--

04:22.679 --> 04:23.794
- Oh, I'm fine.
I'm good.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.136
Drink Jack
out of the bottle,

04:25.265 --> 04:27.005
listen to Patsy Cline,
you know.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.427
It's a man thing.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.768
- Am I, uh,
the last one here?

04:35.901 --> 04:37.641
[soft laughter]

04:37.778 --> 04:40.611
Well, I always enjoy
making an entrance.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.104
[laughter]

04:42.240 --> 04:43.821
I'm Vaughn Carpenter.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.815
Welcome to the Knot.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.534
Mi case as su, uh...

04:48.663 --> 04:50.654
hotel for the weekend.

04:50.791 --> 04:51.951
[laughter]

04:52.083 --> 04:56.042
- Oh, Vaughn, thank you
for having us.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.502
Where's your better half?

04:57.631 --> 04:59.838
- Why, she's, uh,

04:59.966 --> 05:01.297
no longer with us.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.541
No.
- Oh.

05:02.677 --> 05:03.962
- We had a good life.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.842
Look at all of you!

05:07.974 --> 05:09.635
The children
are all grown up,

05:09.768 --> 05:12.805
and the old
are as ugly as ever.

05:12.938 --> 05:14.394
[laughter]

05:14.523 --> 05:17.310
But, of course,
not you, Eleanor.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.057
- Oh, Vaughn.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.185
Here, I want to introduce you
to the birthday girl,

05:21.321 --> 05:22.481
Audrey Parker.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.820
Vaughn Carpenter.
- Hi.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.314
- Hello, you--

05:25.450 --> 05:27.031
Well, you're
the spitting image--

05:27.160 --> 05:28.491
- Um, I'm
sorry?

05:28.620 --> 05:30.736
- Lucy Ripley.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.703
You look exactly like her.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.040
- Lucy Ripley?
Did you know her?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.499
- She's an old friend.

05:36.628 --> 05:37.743
[thunder booming]

05:37.879 --> 05:39.335
Oh, damn.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.126
Oh, the power is temperamental
with the weather.

05:42.259 --> 05:45.126
Excuse me while I check
on the generator.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.672
-Um...

05:49.641 --> 05:51.131
- I thought it'd be best
for them to think

05:51.268 --> 05:52.883
you had passed, Olivia.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.431
- Are you sure
you have to do this?

05:55.564 --> 05:57.225
- I'm getting weaker.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.348
- Please be careful.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.731
- Make sure
they don't see you leave.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.733
Have a safe trip.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.862
[laughter and chatter]

06:27.637 --> 06:30.504
[dramatic music]

06:30.640 --> 06:38.638
J‘J‘

06:59.586 --> 07:02.703
- Okay, everybody, let's take
the presents to the table.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.296
- Do you mind if we get
settled in first, Mom,

07:05.425 --> 07:07.131
pick out rooms,
that kind of thing,

07:07.260 --> 07:09.421
before you start,
you know, cracking the whip?

07:09.554 --> 07:10.930
- I'm not
cracking the whip.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.592
I'm trying
to get everybody organized.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.806
- I'm just saying
maybe ask first.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.220
Anybody have a preference?

07:16.353 --> 07:18.218
- Uh...
- Yeah.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.470
- Do whatever you want.

07:19.606 --> 07:20.812
- All right!

07:20.941 --> 07:22.397
Hey, if they still
have bunk beds,

07:22.525 --> 07:23.731
I get dibs on the bottom.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.475
- No fair.
You always call dibs.

07:25.612 --> 07:26.977
- That's 'cause I'm older,

07:27.113 --> 07:28.489
but I'm faster.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.355
- And you're short.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.699
- So you want me to, uh--
you want me to go with you?

07:32.827 --> 07:34.613
I'll help you--
help you pick out a room.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.953
- I actually thought
I'd walk the grounds

07:37.082 --> 07:38.413
before the rains hit.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.122
- Well, you want me to just

07:40.251 --> 07:43.163
place your bag
in one of the rooms up there?

07:43.296 --> 07:45.708
- Okay.
Sure, yeah.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.000
Thanks.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.715
[thunder booming]

07:56.601 --> 07:58.011
- Well, that was interesting.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.681
- Yeah, that was
a big bucketful of awkward.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.180
- Yeah, speaking
of which, um...

08:03.316 --> 08:05.523
I don't really do
public displays of gift giving,

08:05.652 --> 08:07.313
but I got you a gift.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.481
- Actually, I was gonna go look
for Mr. Carpenter.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.070
You know, he said
that he knows Lucy,

08:11.199 --> 08:12.780
so I wanted to ask him
some questions.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.740
- We just got here.
Don't worry.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.325
You will have all weekend

08:16.454 --> 08:19.412
to catch up with the old guy
that you just met.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.953
- I'm sorry, did you say
that you got me a gift?

08:22.085 --> 08:23.700
What is it?
Is it a pony?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.577
- Forget it.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.169
[thunder booming]

08:41.146 --> 08:42.261
[knock at door]

08:42.397 --> 08:44.183
- Nathan, are you in here?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.257
- Anybody seen Audrey?

09:13.386 --> 09:15.502
- Uh, just long enough
to know

09:15.638 --> 09:18.596
she was looking
for Mr. Carpenter.

09:18.725 --> 09:21.432
- I left my birthday present
in her room.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.678
Figured she needed an outfit
for the party.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.224
She's gonna look fantastic.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.563
' [giggles]

09:27.692 --> 09:29.023
Oh, sweetheart,
would you get Vaughn

09:29.152 --> 09:30.608
and get him
to find some matches?

09:30.737 --> 09:32.602
I forgot to bring something
to light the cake with.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.979
- Aye, aye, Captain.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.651
- And Nath--Nathan.
Where's--Nathan?

09:35.784 --> 09:37.649
Oh, Nathan,
go find Audrey.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.991
- Sorry I'm the last one here.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.329
Took me a little bit
to figure out

09:45.794 --> 09:48.627
- My birthday's in March.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.672
- You like the decorations?

09:52.801 --> 09:54.757
- Dr. Carr, it's amazing.

09:54.886 --> 09:57.047
It's a dragony, um...

09:57.180 --> 09:58.295
- Underwater.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.968
- Underwater wonderland.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.716
What is that?
Is that a sea horse?

10:02.852 --> 10:04.592
- [screams]

10:06.064 --> 10:07.975
Guys, get in here!

10:08.108 --> 10:09.393
- Julia?

10:12.112 --> 10:13.227
- What the hell is that?

10:13.363 --> 10:14.478
- Get back! Get back!
Get back!

10:14.614 --> 10:15.729
Parker.
Thank you.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.856
Don't even touch it.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.651
Oh, boy.

10:21.788 --> 10:25.406
- It looks like...molt.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.952
- Yup, you're right.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.679
Vaughn Carpenter...

10:41.808 --> 10:42.923
was a chameleon.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.174
- What?

10:44.310 --> 10:46.767
- Chief.
- Sorry, Nathan.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.764
A shape-shifter,

10:50.900 --> 10:52.185
a monster,

10:52.318 --> 10:56.186
for want of a better term,
a chameleon.

10:56.322 --> 11:00.031
And it's now shed
Vaughn Carpenter's form

11:00.160 --> 11:02.651
and found itself a new one.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.870
One of ours.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.208
Somebody right here
in this room

11:10.336 --> 11:13.544
is a chameleon,

11:13.673 --> 11:16.665
which means one of us

11:16.801 --> 11:18.211
is a killer.

11:18.344 --> 11:22.462
One of us is dead.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.640
[thunder booming]

11:26.769 --> 11:28.305
I was a rookie

11:28.438 --> 11:31.851
the one time I saw
one of these chameleon things.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.223
I was just back from 'Nam,

11:33.359 --> 11:34.769
where must have thought

11:34.903 --> 11:37.144
I'd pretty much seen
and done everything,

11:37.280 --> 11:39.771
until I was forced
to shoot my own partner

11:39.908 --> 11:42.524
right in the head
to stop him from killing me.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.241
- You killed your partner?

11:44.370 --> 11:46.076
- Chameleon killed my partner.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.537
He'd taken his shape,

11:47.665 --> 11:49.280
taken his personality,
taken everything.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.998
I killed the chameleon--

11:51.127 --> 11:54.745
but not before it had copied
and killed six people.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.792
Now, 27 years
on the job,

11:56.925 --> 11:59.462
and the only thing
I've ever hoped for:

11:59.594 --> 12:02.882
that I'd never have to see
one of them again.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.721
- How do we stop it
from taking someone else?

12:05.850 --> 12:08.762
- Everyone just has
to stay within earshot

12:08.895 --> 12:10.101
of everyone else,

12:10.230 --> 12:11.595
'cause this chameleon thing,

12:11.731 --> 12:14.063
it seems to need time
with its victim

12:14.192 --> 12:15.773
in order to mimic its soul.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.563
Get jumped,

12:17.695 --> 12:18.901
just scream
as loud as you can.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.146
- What does it want?

12:21.282 --> 12:22.738
- It wants to kill, basically.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.949
It wants to change.
It wants to renew itself.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.114
I think everybody here
in this room's

12:27.247 --> 12:30.739
pretty much well aware
that the troubles are now back.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.412
Well, this thing's lived
as Vaughn Carpenter

12:33.544 --> 12:34.954
all these years.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.953
- Well, when the troubles
were gone.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.957
- Now all of a sudden,
it wants to get active again.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.382
It's killed one of us already.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.927
And I guarantee
it's not gonna stop at one.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.596
[thunder booming]

12:57.443 --> 13:00.355
[thunder booming]

13:00.488 --> 13:02.479
- Hang on a second.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.401
Uh...

13:04.534 --> 13:07.025
I'm trying to be Zen
about all this.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.776
Just so I'm clear...

13:08.913 --> 13:11.120
you're saying
that you haven't seen

13:11.249 --> 13:15.117
one of these chameleon deals
since the Reagan administration.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.665
And now, of all the times

13:17.797 --> 13:19.037
and all the places,

13:19.173 --> 13:20.583
we just happen to get stuck
in a storm

13:20.717 --> 13:23.129
inside its damn lair?

13:23.261 --> 13:25.217
I'm just curious
how that happens.

13:25.346 --> 13:28.053
- We didn't happen
to get stuck.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.718
We were invited.

13:33.479 --> 13:34.594
- Dave.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.643
- He called me--
Vaughn.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.640
Said it'd been too long.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.814
Said he'd heard about
all the troubles in town,

13:42.947 --> 13:44.323
about the new FBI agent,

13:44.449 --> 13:45.780
and he wondered if we--

13:45.908 --> 13:47.864
we'd like to come over
for a visit.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.859
And then Eleanor called.
You did.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.078
You called, and you said
you were looking for a place

13:52.206 --> 13:53.332
to throw Audrey a party.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.073
I just thought it was fate!

13:55.209 --> 13:57.586
- You're trying to blame me?
I was looking for--

13:57.712 --> 14:01.204
[all talking at once]

14:01.341 --> 14:03.502
- Well, what was I
supposed to do?

14:03.634 --> 14:05.295
- Okay, everybody quiet.

14:05.428 --> 14:08.465
Please, can we use
our inside voices?

14:08.598 --> 14:10.384
- We should probably
call the mainland,

14:10.516 --> 14:12.507
let 'em know
what's happening.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.474
- Yeah, good luck with that.

14:14.604 --> 14:16.469
I haven't gotten a signal
since we got on the boat.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.346
- The landline's down too.
I checked.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.814
Probably the storm
knocked it out.

14:19.942 --> 14:22.775
- Or the chameleon thing.
- Yup.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.065
- But Vaughn was gonna call
a boat for us when we were--

14:25.198 --> 14:26.859
Well, I guess
that isn't gonna happen.

14:26.991 --> 14:29.448
- Well, now, there's a boathouse
down by the water.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.738
Maybe there's a dinghy we can
take back to the mainland.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.407
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.245
No one's taking any boat
back to any mainland,

14:35.375 --> 14:38.412
not until we're absolutely sure
this chameleon's dead.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.921
- So, what, are you gonna
stop me, Old Man River?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.833
Maybe you just want
to keep me here

14:42.965 --> 14:44.501
so that you can eat me
and take over my body.

14:44.634 --> 14:45.874
- I'm not taking any chances

14:46.010 --> 14:48.046
letting this killer loose
on the mainland.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.921
Now, if you want to throw down
there, yoga mat,

14:51.057 --> 14:52.217
you just feel free.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.760
I've coughed up
tougher than you.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.384
- Hey, if I may interrupt
the Chuck Norris revival

14:56.521 --> 14:58.386
with some logic...

14:58.523 --> 15:00.354
why don't we just go down
to the boathouse

15:00.483 --> 15:02.223
and then decide what to do?

15:02.360 --> 15:03.725
Nathan?

15:03.861 --> 15:05.442
Chief?

15:05.571 --> 15:06.777
- Are you armed?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.988
'Cause she is.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.859
I mean, she's all
"be cool" and whatnot.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.370
She's got a gun.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.112
How do we know
she's not the thingamabob?

15:16.249 --> 15:17.910
- I am not the thingamabob.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.998
Ask me anything, all right?

15:20.128 --> 15:23.120
What--the first boy
that I kissed

15:23.256 --> 15:24.621
was when l was 18.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.839
My favorite singer
is Ray Charles.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.458
- Ray Charles?

15:28.594 --> 15:30.459
- Okay, fine, I lied.
It's Justin Timberlake.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.302
And my middle name
is Prudence,

15:32.432 --> 15:34.263
self-inflicted
on my confirmation.

15:34.392 --> 15:35.882
So are we good now?

15:36.018 --> 15:38.805
- Well, that may all be true,
but...

15:38.938 --> 15:40.724
we don't know you
well enough to know.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.569
- One.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.647
Two.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.406
That's one more
than you knew that I had

15:56.539 --> 15:58.825
and one I could have kept
if I was a bad guy.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.073
- HoW's about...

16:00.209 --> 16:02.370
a little gun for you

16:02.503 --> 16:04.585
and a little gun clip
for you

16:04.714 --> 16:07.296
and big ole gun,
you know, for you

16:07.425 --> 16:10.337
and big clip for...

16:10.470 --> 16:12.631
[laughing]
Not really enough to go around.

16:12.763 --> 16:13.889
- Anybody else?

16:14.015 --> 16:15.221
- I'd certainly feel better

16:15.349 --> 16:17.931
if the other two badges
weren't packing.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.722
- I got nothin'.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.516
Service weapon
is up in my bag.

16:22.648 --> 16:23.933
Feel free to take it.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.272
- What about you, Chief?

16:25.401 --> 16:26.686
- A gun--l was coming
to a party.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.731
Look, there's nothing.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.980
- All right, then.
Anybody else?

16:32.116 --> 16:33.276
Going once.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.569
Going twice.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.159
Okay, boathouse, ASAP.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.749
[thunder booming]

16:59.393 --> 17:01.805
- Okay.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.053
- You get that side?

17:03.189 --> 17:04.725
- Yup.

17:06.901 --> 17:09.062
[grunts]
I'm not sure l--

17:09.195 --> 17:10.901
- Just give it some slack.
Then pull.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.566
- Thank you.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.984
Thanks for up at the hotel too.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.732
- What?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.450
- Well, I was trying
to calm everybody down,

17:18.579 --> 17:19.694
and you backed me up.

17:19.830 --> 17:20.956
Thank you.

17:21.082 --> 17:22.322
- That's what partners do.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.876
Sucks.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.260
You know, you were asking
about Jess before.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.592
It sucks.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.097
But I appreciate
you asking.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.134
- Yeah, that's what friends do.

17:41.477 --> 17:42.592
[door creaks]

17:42.728 --> 17:44.343
- Found this, uh...

17:44.480 --> 17:46.266
in the old storage trunk
out there.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.684
You know,
once that dries out,

17:47.817 --> 17:50.229
it should work pretty fine.

17:50.361 --> 17:52.067
Looks like somebody
hit pay dirt in here.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.402
- Yeah, well,
let's find out.

17:53.531 --> 17:54.691
[clears throat]

17:54.824 --> 17:55.939
- Oh!

17:56.075 --> 17:59.033
- All right.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.698
Looks like we found a boat.
Now what?

18:01.831 --> 18:03.196
- It's the chief.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.583
Think about it.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.370
If you're the chameleon,

18:06.502 --> 18:07.833
you take
the one with power,

18:07.962 --> 18:09.418
the one
that everybody listens to.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.128
- The one
with no social skills.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.122
[laughter]

18:13.259 --> 18:15.841
No, l--
I'd take Nathan.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.676
People listen to him.
People like him.

18:17.805 --> 18:20.137
- Yeah.
Nathan's a good choice.

18:20.266 --> 18:22.348
But the point is,
I wouldn't take me.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.602
- Of course not.

18:23.728 --> 18:24.934
Why take an old man

18:25.062 --> 18:26.472
when there are so many
other choices?

18:26.606 --> 18:28.938
- I wouldn't.
- Me neither.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.689
- Decaf!
- Oh!

18:33.821 --> 18:35.527
- You look like
you could use some.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.317
- [chuckling]

18:43.080 --> 18:44.581
- What did you do?

18:44.707 --> 18:47.540
- Nothing.
- You took the cheese knife.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.375
- If I did,
why wouldn't I tell you?

18:50.504 --> 18:53.541
- Who knows why you do
half the things you do?

18:53.674 --> 18:55.084
- Really?

18:55.217 --> 18:59.426
Now--you want to have
this conversation now?

18:59.555 --> 19:01.091
- I'm sorry.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.804
Oh, I love you.

19:02.933 --> 19:06.596
Please...let's not fight.

19:06.729 --> 19:07.889
- I love you too, Mom.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.933
- Oh.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.852
- We should tell the others.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.191
- And do what, have them
draw straws for a seat?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.106
No, I mean, everybody's
going crazy back there.

19:16.238 --> 19:19.196
[gunshots, air hissing]

19:19.325 --> 19:21.281
- Yeah, so I lied
about having a gun.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.025
So sue me.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.493
I made a call
for the greater good,

19:24.622 --> 19:25.737
a tough call.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.329
One day,
you're gonna grow up,

19:27.458 --> 19:29.073
and you're gonna have
to do the same thing.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.916
- You left us stranded
on this rock.

19:31.045 --> 19:33.536
- Better than letting
a killer loose on the mainland.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.959
Look, leaving this place
is not really an option anymore.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.549
Basically, we either kill
this son of a bitch

19:38.678 --> 19:39.918
right here, right now,

19:40.054 --> 19:41.260
or it kills us.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.754
Got it?

19:47.353 --> 19:49.184
[thunder booming]

19:49.313 --> 19:51.269
- Well?

19:51.399 --> 19:52.764
- No.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.607
I'm afraid
there's no boat, no raft,

19:55.736 --> 19:56.896
no nothing, really,

19:57.029 --> 19:59.566
just a, uh...

19:59.699 --> 20:02.315
some old lanterns,
couple thousand cockroaches.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.567
- Little better luck
on my trip to the attic.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.410
- You went to the attic
by yourself?

20:06.539 --> 20:07.904
I thought we said
to stay together.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.656
- Nathan...

20:10.793 --> 20:11.953
I found a radio.

20:12.086 --> 20:13.622
Maybe I can fix it.

20:13.754 --> 20:17.417
And no,
I don't need any help.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.006
- What can the rest of us do?

20:19.135 --> 20:20.716
- We should find the victim.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.257
We'll know who the chameleon is
if we find the body.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.674
- Yeah, about million places

20:24.807 --> 20:26.388
to hide a body
in a house this size.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.553
We'd better break up into teams.
What do you think?

20:28.686 --> 20:30.768
So let's put the Hardy Boys here
with the Bickersons.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.852
Why don't you go
with them, Nathan?

20:32.982 --> 20:34.188
Parker, you're with me.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.726
- All right.
Duke?

20:35.860 --> 20:38.476
- Party of one.
Thanks.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.738
I have work to do,

20:39.864 --> 20:41.195
and I can't exactly do it

20:41.323 --> 20:42.824
if I'm carrying
the radio around with me.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.156
- All right,
thanks, everybody.

20:44.285 --> 20:46.116
- Urban legend
at my orphanage

20:46.245 --> 20:48.907
used to say that bad kids
would get shut up in the walls,

20:49.039 --> 20:52.281
so we used to do this
to try to find 'em.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.625
Look how far I've come.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.833
Hey, why didn't you
pick Nathan for your team?

20:58.966 --> 21:00.672
[knocks]

21:00.801 --> 21:03.042
- Well, I thought the ladies
needed a little protection.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.215
- That, and you couldn't stand
to talk to your son

21:05.347 --> 21:06.678
for more than five minutes?

21:06.807 --> 21:08.843
- Well...okay.
That too.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.637
- He's in a dark place
right now, you know.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.431
He could really use a friend.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.679
- All the more reason for him
not to have to talk to me then.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.271
- [knocks]

21:16.400 --> 21:18.391
There's something here.

21:18.527 --> 21:21.940
Yeah, this is--
this is boarded up.

21:23.574 --> 21:24.984
- Got it?

21:27.578 --> 21:29.284
- Oh, you know
what that is?

21:29.413 --> 21:30.949
That's an old dumbwaiter.

21:35.503 --> 21:38.666
- Yeah, I guess they really
don't need those things anymore.

21:38.798 --> 21:39.958
- Doesn't matter.
Good find.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.250
Nice job there, Parker.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.543
- [scoffs]

21:42.676 --> 21:44.507
Wow, is that a compliment?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.423
You think it would,
you know, kill you

21:46.555 --> 21:48.671
to lay one of those on Nathan
every once in a while?

21:48.808 --> 21:50.298
- The troubles are back.

21:50.434 --> 21:51.970
Getting all warm and fuzzy
with Nathan

21:52.102 --> 21:54.013
is not exactly gonna
do him any favors.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.386
- He's pretty tough.

21:55.523 --> 21:56.808
- He's gonna have to be
tough as nails

21:56.941 --> 21:58.272
in order to deal with that
on his own.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.015
Otherwise,
it'll eat him alive.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.017
- Still, that doesn't mean
you can't be friendly.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.485
- Now, friendship,
that's a burden.

22:03.614 --> 22:05.275
I don't want to be a burden.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.363
Especially I'm leaving him
a whole world of troubles

22:07.493 --> 22:08.608
he's gonna have to fix.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.109
Let's go.

22:14.208 --> 22:17.700
- Julia...

22:17.837 --> 22:20.249
you okay?

22:20.381 --> 22:21.791
- I don't want to die,

22:21.924 --> 22:23.334
not here,
not like this.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.844
- You're not gonna die.
Stop talking like that.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.506
We're with you.

22:27.638 --> 22:30.380
- No offense, Mom,
but that's not real comforting.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.223
For all I know, right now,
you could be a hell beast

22:33.352 --> 22:34.467
from the seventh circle,

22:34.603 --> 22:35.718
waiting for me
to turn my back

22:35.855 --> 22:37.186
so you can rip off my face

22:37.314 --> 22:39.270
and wear it around town
like a Halloween mask.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.560
- Take it easy.

22:40.693 --> 22:41.808
- We're looking
for a dead body,

22:41.944 --> 22:44.435
and one of us is a monster.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.358
I mean, why do the most awful,
horrible things

22:46.490 --> 22:49.106
keep happening
in this godforsaken town?

22:49.243 --> 22:53.202
I should never have let you
convince me to come back.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.707
- Hey, is everything okay?

22:55.833 --> 22:57.198
- I think
we should switch teams.

23:01.422 --> 23:03.378
- Don't fight me, okay?

23:11.265 --> 23:13.256
- Still she tells me
what to do.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.438
Sorry about before.

23:18.564 --> 23:21.101
I kind of lost it.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.145
- It's an intense situation.

23:24.278 --> 23:27.190
- Here I thought
I was the queen of extreme.

23:27.323 --> 23:30.486
You know, I left town
wanting to walk the Earth,

23:30.618 --> 23:34.202
have adventures,
come back all knowing and wise.

23:34.330 --> 23:39.575
Figured dealing with my mom
was a no-brainer at that point.

23:39.710 --> 23:42.042
Guess I should have
stayed away longer.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.332
[thunder booming]

23:44.465 --> 23:46.001
- Hey, uh...

23:46.133 --> 23:48.124
not that it's
any of my business or anything,

23:48.260 --> 23:51.718
but staying away,
even though it's easier,

23:51.847 --> 23:53.257
you miss out
on a lot of stuff too.

23:55.017 --> 23:58.384
There's all these
newspaper clippings...

23:58.520 --> 23:59.771
including one of you.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.433
- What?

24:04.860 --> 24:06.225
- Huh.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.648
Here's one of Carpenter
as a young man.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.989
- "Noted family's last heir
receives final rites."

24:12.117 --> 24:13.493
- He had bacterial meningitis.

24:13.619 --> 24:14.984
See how his body
was wasting away?

24:15.120 --> 24:16.451
- Mm-hmm.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.037
- And yet here he is,
three days later.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.327
- "Scion makes
miraculous recovery.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.325
Doctors at a loss
for explanation."

24:23.462 --> 24:25.202
- You don't recover
from bacterial meningitis

24:25.339 --> 24:26.499
in three days.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.088
- He didn't.

24:28.217 --> 24:30.173
The chameleon
took his shape.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.918
He's been living as Carpenter
for 27 years.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.420
- You think his wife knew?

24:34.556 --> 24:37.172
- I think so.
Look at the picture.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.049
She just got
the best news ever--

24:39.186 --> 24:40.392
her husband is going to live--

24:40.521 --> 24:42.762
and she's
a million miles away,

24:42.898 --> 24:44.229
thinking of God knows what.

24:44.358 --> 24:45.689
- Yeah, but think.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.683
If she knew the choice
that she had to make...

24:47.820 --> 24:50.607
I mean, the love of your life
is dying,

24:50.739 --> 24:52.275
and you could either,
you know,

24:52.408 --> 24:54.740
live happily ever after
with a perfect copy of him--

24:54.868 --> 24:56.483
somebody that looks like him,

24:56.620 --> 24:58.030
speaks like him,
acts like him,

24:58.163 --> 25:00.199
essentially is him--

25:00.332 --> 25:01.993
or you could be
a widow at 30.

25:02.126 --> 25:05.289
- The idea of having a wife,
a home, an actual life--

25:05.421 --> 25:07.662
it must have been like
a dream come true for him.

25:07.798 --> 25:10.039
- 27 years,
and the troubles come back,

25:10.175 --> 25:13.292
and it all goes to hell.

25:13.429 --> 25:14.885
You know, what I want to know,
though,

25:15.014 --> 25:16.879
is, what does this all
have to do with me?

25:19.143 --> 25:21.179
I know exactly
who I can ask.

25:21.311 --> 25:23.893
You knew him
back then, Vince.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.264
You wrote the article.
Did you know what he was?

25:26.400 --> 25:29.107
- No.
I swear, I had no idea.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.773
- Do you think what we're saying
really is possible,

25:31.905 --> 25:33.566
that this real woman

25:33.699 --> 25:36.065
could live a life
with a thing,

25:36.201 --> 25:38.192
with a--a chameleon?

25:38.328 --> 25:40.740
- The chameleon
isn't a thing.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.204
It's a person.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.788
He's afflicted,

25:43.917 --> 25:45.953
just like the people
you've seen in Haven.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.998
They're no more monsters
than a hungry bear.

25:49.131 --> 25:51.247
They don't deserve
to be feared.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.544
- Unless they're
killing people.

25:53.677 --> 25:55.713
- True enough.

25:55.846 --> 25:58.588
But Lucy always helped
those in need.

25:58.724 --> 26:01.136
She must have helped
the Carpenters back in the day.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.884
That must have been why he
thought you could help him now.

26:04.021 --> 26:05.181
- Wait.
You knew my mother?

26:05.314 --> 26:06.724
- Oh, yes.

26:06.857 --> 26:08.768
- [scoffs]
Why didn't you say anything?

26:08.901 --> 26:10.892
- You stay the hell
away from me!

26:12.738 --> 26:14.899
- What is wrong with you,
you freak?

26:15.032 --> 26:17.694
- I went down
to the boathouse,

26:17.826 --> 26:20.659
and guess what I found.

26:20.788 --> 26:22.369
A boat,

26:22.498 --> 26:24.284
a perfectly good boat,

26:24.416 --> 26:26.122
until you shot it!

26:26.251 --> 26:27.661
- I didn't shoot the boat.

26:27.795 --> 26:29.831
- Where's your gun, Nathan?

26:29.963 --> 26:32.295
'Cause I looked
in your duffel bag.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.255
It's not there.

26:34.384 --> 26:35.510
- Put the ax down.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.251
- You're the chameleon.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.763
- Where's your gun, Nathan?

26:38.889 --> 26:41.801
- I left it in my bag.
I didn't do it!

26:41.934 --> 26:44.300
- Inside voices, please!

26:44.436 --> 26:46.267
All right, listen.

26:46.396 --> 26:49.229
We need to figure out
who the chameleon is--

26:49.358 --> 26:50.598
- Were you not listening?
- No!

26:52.569 --> 26:54.400
and what we're gonna do
with him

26:54.530 --> 26:56.361
or her.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.481
All right?
- Yeah.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.403
- I have an idea.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.199
We can't really know
what the chameleon knew

27:05.332 --> 27:07.948
about the person
that it took.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.326
But we have
to start somewhere.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.293
So each of you brought
a present to the Knot.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.083
I'm assuming
that you didn't take the time

27:14.216 --> 27:16.457
to tell Mr. Carpenter
what that was.

27:16.593 --> 27:18.299
So if you can say
what's in your box,

27:18.428 --> 27:19.964
then we'll chalk one
in your favor.

27:20.097 --> 27:21.962
And if not,

27:22.099 --> 27:24.590
we have a problem.

27:24.726 --> 27:26.466
- I'm going last.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.104
- Huh?

27:28.230 --> 27:30.186
Why does he
get to go last?

27:30.315 --> 27:34.649
- Because he...
has the ax.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.564
- What about, uh,
cue ball over here?

27:36.697 --> 27:39.063
- Well, l-l brought her
the dress.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.360
- And the killer shoes.
- And the purse.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.074
- Well, exactly.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.410
- We're gonna start
with Dr. Carr.

27:45.539 --> 27:47.871
- Earrings.

27:49.042 --> 27:51.203
Emperor penguins.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.173
- All right.

27:55.299 --> 27:56.664
Those are beautiful.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.301
Thank you.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.548
Okay.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.139
Vince.

28:06.268 --> 28:09.601
- It's a book,
Misery Unchained.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.891
It's a first edition,
signed by the author,

28:12.024 --> 28:14.766
just before that lady
chopped off his foot.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.142
- Okay.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.152
- Can I see that?

28:23.285 --> 28:24.525
- Sure.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.325
Okay.

28:29.458 --> 28:30.868
Nathan.

28:31.001 --> 28:33.242
- It's a sweater.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.993
Blue.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.370
Cashmere.

28:47.184 --> 28:49.516
- It's a scarf.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.431
- Oh, my God.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.019
- It is him.
I knew it!

28:53.148 --> 28:54.388
- Easy!
- Hey! Hey!

28:54.524 --> 28:55.980
- Somebody do something!

28:56.109 --> 28:58.236
- Okay, everybody
just calm down for...

29:00.239 --> 29:01.479
- [shrieks]

29:04.326 --> 29:05.816
- Tie him up.

29:13.335 --> 29:14.666
- You have a gun.

29:14.795 --> 29:16.626
- Yup.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.871
- You lied.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.122
- Maybe I did.

29:20.259 --> 29:21.840
- Chief, hand it over.

29:21.969 --> 29:23.584
We all play
by the same rules.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.631
- Says who?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.470
- Says the whole room

29:27.599 --> 29:29.430
that's about to go
Lord of the Flies on your ass.

29:31.103 --> 29:32.593
- Well...

29:36.441 --> 29:37.601
- Duke.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.725
- Huh?

29:39.861 --> 29:41.817
- Even the playing field.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.608
- [scoffs]

29:51.623 --> 29:53.033
Happy?

29:57.129 --> 29:58.790
- That was manly.

30:00.590 --> 30:04.003
- What are we gonna do
with him?

30:04.136 --> 30:06.377
- I am not the damn chameleon.

30:06.513 --> 30:08.128
- Okay, now,
why did you not know

30:08.265 --> 30:10.472
what was in the box,
then, Nathan?

30:10.600 --> 30:13.387
- I told Jess to pick up

30:13.520 --> 30:17.513
the sweater we saw
in McGuinness's last week.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.982
She must have seen the scarf
and changed her mind.

30:21.111 --> 30:23.693
She didn't tell me
before she left.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.358
- What about the boat

30:25.490 --> 30:26.696
and the gun?

30:26.825 --> 30:29.658
- I'm not armed.
You searched me.

30:29.786 --> 30:31.322
- The chief is the one
who shot the boat!

30:31.455 --> 30:32.661
- Yeah!

30:32.789 --> 30:34.040
- He"
- All right.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.532
Before y'all
yell at me, okay.

30:36.668 --> 30:38.044
That proves
I'm not the chameleon.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.161
The chameleon would want
to go to the mainland.

30:40.297 --> 30:41.787
- Any chance
I could get untied

30:41.923 --> 30:43.709
before everyone
goes crazy again?

30:43.842 --> 30:46.049
- How do we know
you're not the chameleon?

30:46.178 --> 30:47.884
- And how do we know
that you're not?

30:48.013 --> 30:49.844
If we start
turning on each other now,

30:49.973 --> 30:51.838
we're just as likely
to kill an innocent person

30:51.975 --> 30:54.557
as we are a chameleon.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.063
Listen, I don't know
any of you very well,

30:57.189 --> 30:59.896
but I would like to.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.981
And I would like to think
that we're better than that.

31:02.110 --> 31:04.726
- I probably should have
given you a chance to...

31:04.863 --> 31:06.023
- Yeah, you should have.

31:06.156 --> 31:07.362
- Say something
before I hit you.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.777
- So what now?
Do we keep--

31:09.910 --> 31:11.025
[thunder booming]

31:11.161 --> 31:12.276
[electricity crackles]

31:12.412 --> 31:16.781
[panicked chatter]

31:16.917 --> 31:18.703
[overlapping shouts]

31:22.756 --> 31:23.871
- Oh!

31:24.007 --> 31:25.508
- [whispering]
Stay down.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.376
- Hey, don't you go
for that ax head!

31:29.513 --> 31:31.469
- [chuckles]

31:31.598 --> 31:33.008
I wasn't even
thinking about it.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.768
And for once,

31:38.897 --> 31:40.683
it wasn't me.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.397
I swear.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.270
What the hell
just happened?

31:48.407 --> 31:51.240
- Exactly what a predator
would want.

31:52.494 --> 31:54.155
Every man for himself.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.491
[banging]

32:01.795 --> 32:03.035
[clanking]

32:04.923 --> 32:06.129
- [screams]
Garland.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.920
- Eleanor.
- What are you doing?

32:09.052 --> 32:11.008
- I'm tired of this.
I'm gonna kill this thing.

32:11.138 --> 32:13.049
I'm gonna force it out,
face it.

32:13.181 --> 32:15.593
- Don't be an idiot.
Come on and hide.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.852
- Look, I tied my son
to a chair.

32:17.978 --> 32:19.468
I accused him
of being a murderer.

32:19.604 --> 32:22.266
I'm tired of letting this thing
play with my head.

32:22.399 --> 32:23.605
- If we crucified ourselves

32:23.733 --> 32:25.234
every time
we screwed up as parents,

32:25.360 --> 32:27.066
well, there'd be no more
parents in the world.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.277
- I could have
actually killed him.

32:29.406 --> 32:31.397
- Garland, I dropped Julia
on her head

32:31.533 --> 32:33.899
when she was six months old.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.161
Twice.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.572
- Hmm.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.115
Well, thanks.

32:44.296 --> 32:47.288
[thunder booming]

33:04.107 --> 33:05.563
[switches clicking]

33:08.403 --> 33:09.904
- Well, it isn't
the breakers.

33:10.030 --> 33:12.316
- This place has got to have
a backup generator.

33:12.449 --> 33:13.689
We need to split up
and find it.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.031
- Hang on.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.776
You said that we should
stick together.

33:17.913 --> 33:19.119
- There are four people

33:19.247 --> 33:20.748
who are sitting ducks
in the dark.

33:20.874 --> 33:22.660
We need to get to them
before the chameleon does,

33:22.792 --> 33:25.124
and that'll be a lot easier
with the lights on.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.868
- Man up.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.963
- That would be a lot easier
if I still had my ax!

33:46.858 --> 33:48.098
[clank]

33:53.532 --> 33:56.695
This is why you don't
throw people birthday parties.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.150
- [screams]

34:48.211 --> 34:49.747
- Mom?

34:58.179 --> 34:59.430
- I'm sorry.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.547
She's gone.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.931
- Okay.

35:12.068 --> 35:15.652
All right, uh...

35:15.780 --> 35:18.863
looks like a broken neck.

35:18.992 --> 35:20.607
- I thought you said
the chameleon killed

35:20.744 --> 35:22.280
by taking over its victims.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.494
- Well, yeah, but maybe
it didn't have enough time

35:24.623 --> 35:26.409
and panicked and took off.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.827
- All right,
the backup generator is--

35:34.299 --> 35:36.255
Oh, no.

35:36.384 --> 35:37.669
- I can't remember

35:37.802 --> 35:39.588
what the last thing
I said to her was.

35:41.848 --> 35:44.134
- All of you should
come here and see this!

35:50.690 --> 35:51.975
-Jeez

35:53.818 --> 35:55.069
- That is a big crack.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.401
- Yeah, well, the weather

35:56.529 --> 35:58.394
can play havoc
with these old houses.

35:58.531 --> 36:00.692
That's probably what happened
to the electricity too.

36:00.825 --> 36:03.658
- But an earthquake in Maine?

36:05.080 --> 36:06.320
- Yeah.

36:08.583 --> 36:09.698
Well, yeah.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.620
- What?

36:15.340 --> 36:17.296
- Can I talk to you
for a second?

36:17.425 --> 36:18.676
- Yeah.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.381
Hey, listen,
this is gonna get worse

36:22.514 --> 36:23.924
before it gets better,

36:24.057 --> 36:25.922
so we need to find some way
to call for help.

36:26.059 --> 36:28.596
- Do you trust me?

36:28.728 --> 36:31.014
- Yeah, of course I do.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.186
Are you okay?

36:43.451 --> 36:44.566
- No, I'm not.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.034
- What are--

36:52.293 --> 36:54.079
What the hell
are you doing?

36:54.212 --> 36:55.748
No.
Oh, please!

36:55.880 --> 36:57.131
[gunshot]

36:59.050 --> 37:00.460
- Nathan!

37:13.064 --> 37:14.600
- You killed my friend.

37:14.733 --> 37:18.271
' [gasping]
How--how did you know it was me?

37:18.403 --> 37:20.564
- Audrey...

37:20.697 --> 37:23.530
I can feel her touch.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.398
I can't feel yours.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.360
- What did you do?

37:29.748 --> 37:31.158
- She's the chameleon.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.282
- [gasping]

37:33.418 --> 37:35.704
I'm sorry.

37:37.255 --> 37:39.667
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.460
The doctor...

37:41.593 --> 37:44.881
the doctor,
she saw who I was.

37:45.013 --> 37:47.004
And...

37:47.140 --> 37:48.880
Audrey...

37:49.017 --> 37:50.882
[gasps]
l was weakening,

37:51.019 --> 37:54.307
and I thought
she could help me,

37:54.439 --> 37:56.304
like Lucy.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.853
- If you thought
she could help,

37:58.985 --> 38:00.976
then why did you
kill her?

38:01.112 --> 38:03.945
- She's different.

38:04.073 --> 38:07.941
She--she should have died.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.986
- She's alive?

38:12.123 --> 38:14.865
Where is she?
Where is she?

38:15.001 --> 38:16.707
[pounding on door]
Audrey, can you hear us?

38:16.836 --> 38:18.372
Audrey!

38:20.131 --> 38:21.246
It's in here.

38:21.382 --> 38:22.792
- Find the light!

38:27.972 --> 38:29.508
She's alive.
Get her out.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.256
Get her out.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.808
Parker?
Parker.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.179
Julia, some help.

38:39.234 --> 38:40.349
Audrey.

38:40.485 --> 38:42.567
Come on. Come on.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.528
- Hand me that disinfectant.

38:45.657 --> 38:48.069
- Come on. Come on.

38:48.201 --> 38:49.657
- Parker, come on.

38:49.786 --> 38:51.447
- I don't think she needs
to be disinfected.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.695
- The ammonia will act
as a smelling salt.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.950
Audrey, can you hear me?

38:58.086 --> 39:00.702
Pulse is getting stronger.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.204
She's gonna be okay.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.705
- [sighs]

39:03.842 --> 39:05.503
Parker, you're gonna be okay.

39:05.635 --> 39:08.468
You're gonna be okay.

39:08.596 --> 39:10.382
- [groans softly]

39:10.515 --> 39:11.755
Are you crying?

39:11.891 --> 39:13.222
- [scoffs]

39:13.351 --> 39:15.057
- 'Cause crying
will not be tolerated.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.767
[laughs weakly]

39:16.896 --> 39:19.182
[all chuckle]

39:27.323 --> 39:30.065
I don't think
that he was a monster at all.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.317
He came to me,
and he asked me for help,

39:32.453 --> 39:35.490
and I told him I didn't know
how to help him, you know?

39:35.623 --> 39:39.707
He looked--
he looked really sad.

39:39.836 --> 39:42.953
That's the last thing
that I remember before,

39:43.089 --> 39:45.125
you know, he became me.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.421
Just how "me" was he?

39:49.554 --> 39:50.919
- Pretty you.
I mean, pretty mu--

39:51.055 --> 39:52.966
[chuckles]
Pretty much exactly you.

39:53.099 --> 39:56.341
- Yeah? And when did you
realize he wasn't me?

39:56.477 --> 39:58.513
- I just--l knew.

39:58.646 --> 40:00.762
- [laughing] Yeah, you think
you know me that well?

40:00.899 --> 40:03.561
- No, not that well.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.643
What's your middle name?

40:06.779 --> 40:08.110
- My middle name?

40:08.239 --> 40:09.854
Really?

40:09.991 --> 40:11.731
It's Prudence.

40:11.868 --> 40:14.109
Self-inflicted
at my confirmation.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.951
[chuckles]

40:16.080 --> 40:19.072
And yours?

40:19.208 --> 40:20.459
- Thaddeus.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.121
- Thaddeus?

40:22.253 --> 40:23.538
Thaddeus.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.002
- lnflicted by the chief.

40:25.131 --> 40:26.632
- He is a bad man.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.043
- Uh-huh.

40:33.348 --> 40:35.339
- HoW's Julia?

40:35.475 --> 40:37.557
- Not good.

40:37.685 --> 40:40.802
I think
she's still in shock.

40:40.939 --> 40:44.056
- Yeah, I think we all are.

40:44.192 --> 40:48.151
Can't believe
that Dr. Carr is gone.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.019
- I'll see you at work.

40:52.075 --> 40:53.861
- You did really good
in there.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.403
- What?
- I'm proud of you.

40:55.536 --> 40:57.822
When it all hit the fan,
you didn't flinch.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.662
You had to shoot
your own partner.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.372
You know, part of me thinks

41:01.501 --> 41:04.584
you kind of grew up
a little bit today.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.088
- You don't know me at all,
do you?

41:06.214 --> 41:07.795
- Just trying to give you
a compliment, son.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.380
Take a compliment when--

41:09.509 --> 41:12.672
- You think I need to grow up,
be like you?

41:12.804 --> 41:14.840
I'm not like you.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.804
Okay?
I don't want to be like you.

41:20.311 --> 41:21.972
- Got a whole pack.

41:28.403 --> 41:31.019
- If you need anything,
anything at all,

41:31.155 --> 41:33.897
please don't hesitate
to call.

41:34.033 --> 41:35.944
- We'll see you
real soon, huh?

41:36.077 --> 41:37.533
- Thank you.

41:51.551 --> 41:53.883
- Hey.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.252
Happy birthday.

41:55.388 --> 41:57.424
- [laughs]
You're kidding me.

41:57.557 --> 41:59.718
- Ah, just 'cause
you got body snatched

41:59.851 --> 42:02.718
doesn't mean you don't get
a present on your birthday.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.560
- Yeah.

42:11.237 --> 42:13.193
Wow, this is beautiful.

42:17.243 --> 42:19.279
Thank you.

42:19.412 --> 42:21.494
- Look closer,

42:21.622 --> 42:22.873
at the engraving.

42:24.834 --> 42:26.074
_ "L R"?

42:29.839 --> 42:31.454
- Lucy Ripley.

42:34.552 --> 42:35.962
- How...

42:36.095 --> 42:37.926
Where did you get this?

42:43.144 --> 42:44.884
- Lucy gave it to me.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.265
The boy...

42:51.402 --> 42:57.568
standing next to Lucy
in the Colorado Kid photo...

42:57.700 --> 42:59.361
is me.
