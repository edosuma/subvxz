they just lost their nanny.

in a bind.
A nanny.

some experience with infants.

my new employer have one?

This trip is

You have to help me

What's in it?
It's something which,
if in the wrong hands,

create massive destruction.

We don't have much time.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.849
You were brought
to this community
for a reason.

00:48.916 --> 00:51.319
To hide because
we were in danger.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.988
Somebody way up in D.C.,
I find out who, I'll kill
the son of a bitch myself,

00:55.055 --> 00:58.259

to hide and seek.
Seek what?

00:58.326 --> 01:00.128
There's a man
living in this community...

been involved in the attacks
last month.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.099
- Who is he?
- Elliot Gillum.

He's a Canadian who's
been living in this country
for over a decade.

01:08.936 --> 01:12.606
He's got
a bioengineering company.
His wife's named Susan.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.742
Do we want to do this
in private?

01:14.808 --> 01:18.612

the women in this room

- In what manner?

01:24.518 --> 01:26.587
They want to use Molly
to make contact
with Gillum.

01:26.654 --> 01:29.523
Once you've done that,
they want you
to befriend Susan.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.792

about her.
- And what about us?

any financial statements
around the house.

four students in your homeroom--

Their parents work
for Gillum's company.

[ Bob ]
So someone in Washington...

01:51.044 --> 01:54.615
has put our wives in a
potentially dangerous situation
for weeks and none of us knew?

01:54.682 --> 01:57.017
Instead of
pulling 'em out now,
they want 'em in deeper?

01:57.084 --> 01:59.920
- I don't think so.
- Objections?
I'm ready to hear 'em.

01:59.987 --> 02:01.622
I signed myself up,
not my wife.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.558

02:07.395 --> 02:10.231
Did someone assassinate
our vice president...

02:10.298 --> 02:13.867
and try to kill the man
that we elected to be
our next president?

02:13.934 --> 02:17.871
- Amongst other atrocities.
- Then we are at war.

02:17.938 --> 02:22.042
We're in a war for this
country's survival and someone
thinks that we might be of use.

02:22.109 --> 02:23.811
[ Ryan ]
It's an extreme situation.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.547
It's a one-time deal.
That's what
they promised me.

02:26.614 --> 02:31.785
- Their promises mean anything?
- And if we find something,
does that mean it's over?

02:31.852 --> 02:34.388
- Do I get my kids back?
- That's what it means.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.490
They're not trained
for this, Tom.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.592
Good thing I married

It's a map back to our kids.
Mm-hmm.

you were screaming

in the day to have every kid
come in early...

I can dig into their lives.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.143
I set something up
so that he will come to me.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.946

So that he will have

No.
You can't touch them.

- If you try,
they'll kill them.
- They're gonna kill 'em anyway.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.015
They told me as long
as I didn't talk...

05:48.081 --> 05:51.351
that my family would just
be watched until it's over.

You got radiation poisoning
from military grade plutonium.

06:04.965 --> 06:09.336
If you built them a weapon--
Your family checks out
in three days.

06:09.403 --> 06:13.273
So whatever it is you made
for them, they're gonna use it
before then, aren't they?

06:13.340 --> 06:16.577
I'm sorry.
God believe me, I am.

06:16.644 --> 06:20.380
These people will not leave
anyone alive who can
possibly identify them.

As soon as that
weapon goes off,
your family will be killed,

the only hope you have.

06:40.167 --> 06:43.437
The poison that's inside me...

06:43.504 --> 06:46.607

the water supply.

First, you bring me my family.
