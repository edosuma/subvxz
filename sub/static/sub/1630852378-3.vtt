14:23.080 --> 14:25.408

14:30.500 --> 14:32.039

15:05.370 --> 15:07.159

19:37.140 --> 19:38.430
It's why...

19:39.480 --> 19:43.440
That is exactly why I don't think Hyun Soo is the killer.

19:45.359 --> 19:47.319
Not once but 13 times.

19:47.779 --> 19:50.699
It has to be the result of underlying resentment.

19:50.700 --> 19:51.700

19:52.910 --> 19:55.450
Judging by the level of brutality,

19:55.660 --> 19:58.910

Not this again.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.048
only have two options.

20:13.049 --> 20:16.430
Find definitive evidence that links Hyun Soo to the crime...

20:17.099 --> 20:19.849
or get a confession out of him.

20:20.980 --> 20:23.808
All you have is circumstantial evidence though...

20:23.809 --> 20:26.519
which is why you had him sent to prison. Right?

You don't look like you need it.

21:46.099 --> 21:48.229
(Infirmary)

21:48.230 --> 21:49.819
Please.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.240
Excuse me.

22:01.160 --> 22:04.039
Here. They're painkillers.

22:04.539 --> 22:05.660
I hope they can help.

22:12.210 --> 22:13.420
What do you think you're doing?

22:14.759 --> 22:17.720
I'm sorry. Please...

22:17.930 --> 22:19.639
I gave him medicine.

22:19.640 --> 22:20.640
You did?

22:22.559 --> 22:24.269
But he belongs to us.

22:44.200 --> 22:46.579
You have some nerve.

22:57.170 --> 22:59.970
You. Know your place.

23:19.319 --> 23:22.160
Around 4:25am on Wednesday,

23:23.029 --> 23:24.829
Ms. Hong, a 25-year-old female,

23:25.579 --> 23:27.788
was found murdered in her residence.

23:27.789 --> 23:29.118
(Implementing Justice and Protecting Human Rights)

23:29.119 --> 23:31.419
At a five-minute distance from the scene,

23:31.420 --> 23:33.709
the police picked up Mr. Kim, the 25-year-old male suspect,

23:33.710 --> 23:36.048
and escorted him to the station.

23:36.049 --> 23:39.588
Jeez. Our chief cleans up well.

23:39.589 --> 23:41.220
He finally has some good luck, for a change.

23:41.930 --> 23:43.969
I heard he already got an offer.

23:43.970 --> 23:47.019
Hansung? What's the average salary there?

23:47.470 --> 23:49.849
The police presume that Kim raped...

23:50.140 --> 23:51.808
and brutally murdered Hong, the victim,

23:51.809 --> 23:53.939
- between midnight and 1am, - I'm home.

23:53.940 --> 23:56.819
the estimated time of Hong's death,

23:57.029 --> 23:58.990
under the influence of alcohol and drugs.

23:59.950 --> 24:03.240
Based on the 13 stab wounds found on the victim's body,

24:03.410 --> 24:04.618
the prosecution is leaning...

24:04.619 --> 24:06.740
toward it being a killing with malice aforethought.

24:07.910 --> 24:09.578
Due to the brutality of the crime...

24:09.579 --> 24:11.619
and the possibility of the suspect having committed additional crimes,

24:12.079 --> 24:13.328
the prosecution has decided...

24:13.329 --> 24:16.038
to disclose the identity of the suspect to the public,

24:16.039 --> 24:17.338
based on the Special Act...

24:17.339 --> 24:20.170
on the Punishment of Specific Violent Crimes.

24:22.430 --> 24:26.430
The accused is Kim Hyun Soo, a 25-year-old male.

24:29.809 --> 24:32.139
He is a college student...

24:32.140 --> 24:34.230
with no criminal record or any previous convictions,

24:34.440 --> 24:37.018
but the police and prosecution are investigating him...

24:37.019 --> 24:38.730
as they believe he was deeply involved in the murder.

24:38.940 --> 24:41.568
You said there was a possibility that he committed additional crimes.

24:41.569 --> 24:44.108
- Hey. - Could this be a serial case?

24:44.109 --> 24:45.739
- How embarrassing. - You little...

24:45.740 --> 24:47.239
- What? - You scumbag.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.618
- Nothing has been confirmed yet. - Do you want to die?

24:49.619 --> 24:51.539
- You little jerk. - Get lost.

24:52.829 --> 24:53.829
Good grief.

25:04.759 --> 25:08.349
Did Kim Hyun Soo and the victim take drugs together?

25:13.140 --> 25:15.849

25:16.690 --> 25:18.649
- Hyun Soo, is it you? - Yes, it's me.

25:18.650 --> 25:21.819
- I'm at the prison... - Hey! Stop.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.119
This call is being recorded,

25:27.369 --> 25:29.619
so calm down and be careful what you say.

25:30.539 --> 25:32.289
- Okay? - Okay.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.829
So? How are you holding up?

25:40.299 --> 25:42.170
Well, I'm all right.

25:44.220 --> 25:46.838
What's going to happen to me now?

25:46.839 --> 25:48.548
In about ten days,

25:48.549 --> 25:50.508
they'll hold a hearing to review the legality of confinement.

25:50.509 --> 25:53.269
They want to make sure the arrest was lawful and reasonable.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.809
Well, you don't need to worry about it.

25:56.769 --> 25:57.900
Ten days?

26:01.109 --> 26:02.980
I can still get out, right?

26:03.069 --> 26:04.069
Hyun Soo.

26:04.819 --> 26:08.108
It's only natural to have a lot on your mind when you're in there,

26:08.109 --> 26:09.990
but try not to think about anything. Okay?

26:10.079 --> 26:13.039
Empty your mind. It'll help you cope with this.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.910
I want to,

26:15.619 --> 26:17.039
but it's hard.

26:17.710 --> 26:20.500
Yes, I understand. But try not to think about anything.

26:21.170 --> 26:23.299
Just tell yourself this one thing, Hyun Soo.

26:25.009 --> 26:28.589
"I am getting out of here, no matter what."

26:30.390 --> 26:31.390

Okay.

26:48.609 --> 26:49.910

26:50.319 --> 26:52.739
Has Mr. Kim Hyun Soo confessed to everything?

26:52.740 --> 26:55.619
We'll share more details with you at our next briefing.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.460
I'm Kim Hyun Soo's attorney.

26:59.119 --> 27:02.289
I'm an attorney who represents Mr. Kim Hyun Soo, the accused.

27:02.839 --> 27:03.839
- May we interview you? - Sure.

27:06.670 --> 27:09.179
The prosecution insists that Mr. Kim is guilty...

27:09.180 --> 27:11.088
based on circumstantial evidence alone.

27:11.089 --> 27:12.890
Here's what I'd like to ask the prosecutors.

27:13.599 --> 27:15.970
Rape. Serial murders.

27:16.680 --> 27:18.769
Where is the evidence?

27:19.099 --> 27:22.018
The police made a hasty judgement and pegged him as the killer...

27:22.019 --> 27:23.729
before they even launched their investigation.

27:23.730 --> 27:26.400
And based on the results of the police investigation,

27:27.029 --> 27:29.199
the prosecutors abused their authority...

27:29.200 --> 27:30.859
and took the liberty of indicting Mr. Kim.

27:37.160 --> 27:40.829
Hello, sir. It's been so long since we last spoke.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.460
Yes.

27:43.039 --> 27:47.170
You know, the Chrysanthemum case is causing quite a stir these days.

27:49.089 --> 27:51.970
Would I be able to get Kim Hyun Soo's address?

28:18.660 --> 28:19.829
Why... Why are you doing this?

28:24.920 --> 28:26.380
Let go.

28:32.180 --> 28:33.180
Help!

28:41.019 --> 28:42.059
Hey, kiddo.

28:42.230 --> 28:44.690
Why... Why are you doing this?

28:45.900 --> 28:48.069
The court isn't the only place where trials take place.

28:57.079 --> 29:00.829
This is why one should never do such a horrible thing.

30:44.099 --> 30:46.429
Just a moment. This will hurt a little.

30:46.430 --> 30:48.189
Stay still. Just a moment.

30:48.190 --> 30:49.690
There, it's done.

30:53.650 --> 30:55.400
Oh, boy.

30:55.490 --> 30:58.660
My goodness. This is bad.

30:59.319 --> 31:03.619
Doctor, can we just... I want to just chop them off.

31:03.740 --> 31:04.910
The whole feet.

31:05.079 --> 31:07.369
You see, these little buggers are very smart.

31:07.869 --> 31:10.129
If we do that, they'll just move to a different part of the body.

31:10.130 --> 31:12.379
They'll target the weakest part of your body.

31:12.380 --> 31:16.008
Usually, a soft, moist spot that will make a good home.

31:16.009 --> 31:17.589
For example...

31:21.089 --> 31:24.219
- Darn it. - I'll prescribe you some ointment.

31:24.220 --> 31:25.809
Apply plenty of it on the affected area.

31:26.809 --> 31:27.929
You know the plastic wrap, right?

31:27.930 --> 31:30.269
Make sure you wrap it around the feet.

31:30.349 --> 31:32.268
You mean, the cling wrap for food?

31:32.269 --> 31:33.269
Yes.

31:33.359 --> 31:36.359
But wouldn't it keep the area wet?

31:36.819 --> 31:39.990
If you don't want to do that, you can use aluminium foil instead.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.240
What? That's nonsense.

31:42.700 --> 31:46.079
I can't walk around like that. They're not sweet potatoes.

31:46.450 --> 31:48.539
Well, if you don't want to do that...

31:49.660 --> 31:50.710
We'll have to chop them off.

31:51.170 --> 31:52.250

36:52.630 --> 36:53.800

37:03.190 --> 37:04.980
that he's guilty?

37:09.650 --> 37:11.320
That night,

37:12.820 --> 37:15.780

37:22.869 --> 37:25.000

37:43.349 --> 37:44.900
and at the police station,

all he did...

37:47.610 --> 37:50.280
was ask if the girl had died.

Is the girl...

37:52.739 --> 37:54.070
dead?

37:54.570 --> 37:56.070

I can offer you my help.

42:21.670 --> 42:22.840
If you need it, that is.

42:39.980 --> 42:41.730

43:37.289 --> 43:40.250
Hey, kid. Do you have shampoo?

43:41.630 --> 43:45.300
Washing your scalp with soap will give you dandruff.

43:49.590 --> 43:51.219
Here. Go ahead.

43:54.679 --> 43:55.679
Thank you.

43:56.019 --> 43:57.849
Are you and Do Ji Tae acquaintances?

44:00.650 --> 44:01.650
We're not.

44:07.150 --> 44:11.989
Kiddo, don't you also find it to be weird?

44:15.449 --> 44:18.659
Why would Do Ji Tae show interest in someone like you?

44:25.920 --> 44:26.920
Anyway, I'll see you around.

44:28.130 --> 44:29.130
Be well.

44:52.449 --> 44:53.909
I'm lawyer Park Mi Kyung.

44:55.619 --> 44:56.619
Please have a seat.

44:56.789 --> 44:57.789
Right.

45:02.670 --> 45:05.129
I felt bad about what was happening...

45:05.130 --> 45:07.049
to a student at my Alma mater.

45:07.050 --> 45:10.339
I raised my concern to Ms. Park,

45:10.340 --> 45:13.679
and she gladly agreed to talk to you both.

45:14.679 --> 45:17.510
Did you already sign with Mr. Shin Joong Han?

45:19.519 --> 45:20.889
No, not yet.

45:22.019 --> 45:24.809
He's a third-rate attorney.

45:25.400 --> 45:28.190
In our circle, he's known for his work with petty offenders.

45:28.570 --> 45:31.319
He negotiates payment with clients and demands hefty retainers...

45:31.320 --> 45:33.360
while doing none of the actual work.

45:33.860 --> 45:37.489
No wonder. I told you he seemed shady.

45:38.079 --> 45:39.079
Right.

45:42.159 --> 45:43.170
Here.

45:44.170 --> 45:45.170
Thank you.

45:46.960 --> 45:48.710
Meanwhile, our law firm...

45:49.000 --> 45:51.718

45:51.719 --> 45:53.049
as well as an advisory team...

45:53.050 --> 45:55.179
consisting of former detectives and NFS experts.

45:55.889 --> 45:59.260
I have one clear rule at my law firm.

45:59.889 --> 46:02.848
Whether the client is innocent or guilty,

46:02.849 --> 46:05.440
he or she is to be returned home.

46:07.309 --> 46:10.820
I will fight for Hyun Soo myself.

46:12.610 --> 46:13.780
But...

46:14.949 --> 46:17.239
what about the retainer?

46:17.699 --> 46:19.738
We can't afford much, you see.

46:19.739 --> 46:20.739
Pro bono.

46:25.500 --> 46:27.578
She'll do it for free.

46:27.579 --> 46:29.380
- Right. - Sorry?

46:29.840 --> 46:34.339
You'll take on Hyun Soo's case for free?

46:34.340 --> 46:35.340
That's right.

46:36.590 --> 46:40.138
So please do not be so worried...

46:40.139 --> 46:41.969
and let us fight your battle.

46:42.019 --> 46:44.768
My gosh. Thank you so much.

47:20.179 --> 47:22.349
This had better work.

47:40.119 --> 47:43.579
This little...

47:45.369 --> 47:47.710

We met her yesterday.

48:09.349 --> 48:13.479
Dad, I like Mr. Shin Joong Han.

48:13.480 --> 48:14.570
Why would you suddenly do this?

48:14.769 --> 48:17.110
You like him because you have no idea.

48:17.280 --> 48:20.489
Apparently, everyone in the industry calls him a third-rate attorney.

48:20.570 --> 48:22.320
He specializes in petty cases.

48:22.659 --> 48:24.659
And he doesn't do any work until he gets paid.

48:25.489 --> 48:27.999
Even so, he's been helping me all along.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.328
I'll feel bad if we suddenly hire someone else.

48:30.329 --> 48:32.289
Why would you feel bad? He's done nothing.

48:32.460 --> 48:35.669
Hyun Soo, Ms. Park has kindly offered...

48:35.670 --> 48:37.460
to represent you free of charge.

48:39.590 --> 48:40.630
For free?

48:40.760 --> 48:44.299
Yes. She feels bad that you're being groundlessly accused...

48:44.300 --> 48:45.719
and wants to help you, free of charge.

48:46.179 --> 48:48.730
You know we can't afford a lawyer. I'm so relieved.

48:50.639 --> 48:53.480
Now, you have a competent lawyer representing you,

48:53.690 --> 48:54.940
so everything will be okay.

48:55.440 --> 48:56.650
Don't worry about anything.

48:57.980 --> 49:00.239

Okay.

49:04.739 --> 49:07.989
(Underwear Clearance)

49:08.659 --> 49:10.658
How much is this?

49:10.659 --> 49:11.868
There's no price tag.

49:11.869 --> 49:13.670
- If you buy 4, it's 10 dollars. - It's 10 dollars?

49:19.340 --> 49:21.969
Oh, that boxer. It's 3 for 15 dollars.

49:22.719 --> 49:24.139
- Okay, I'll get this one. - Sure.

49:24.550 --> 49:26.300
- I don't need the box. - Okay.

49:28.889 --> 49:31.940
Hey, I did my best to pick out a nice one.

49:43.280 --> 49:46.119
Here. This is in your inmate account.

49:46.699 --> 49:47.780
My inmate account?

49:48.119 --> 49:49.658
Yes, it's money you can spend here.

49:49.659 --> 49:52.250
The balance was zero, so I've deposited a small amount.

49:52.750 --> 49:55.630
I see. I guess my parents didn't know.

49:56.289 --> 49:57.289
Thank you.

49:57.290 --> 49:59.670
No worries. It's not even much.

50:13.059 --> 50:14.139
Yes, go ahead.

What? What is it?

50:17.440 --> 50:18.519
Well...

50:19.610 --> 50:20.650
This.

50:21.530 --> 50:23.280
I really appreciate it,

50:25.159 --> 50:26.199

50:27.619 --> 50:28.619
I...

50:29.530 --> 50:31.579
I have a new lawyer now.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.170
What do you mean?

50:41.670 --> 50:43.630
According to my parents,

50:45.300 --> 50:46.760
a different lawyer...

50:47.139 --> 50:49.889
has offered to help me for free.

50:55.019 --> 50:56.389
Really?

50:58.269 --> 51:00.480
For free? I see.

51:00.940 --> 51:02.780
Have they decided to go with a public defender?

51:03.780 --> 51:05.570
I don't think so.

51:06.699 --> 51:08.619
The lawyer's name is Park Mi Kyung.

51:08.869 --> 51:10.869
She has her own law firm.

51:11.989 --> 51:13.039
Park Mi Kyung?

Yes.

51:21.420 --> 51:23.420
Lawyer Park Mi Kyung. I see.

51:24.510 --> 51:27.010
She's famous. She's very well-known...

51:27.340 --> 51:28.679
and well-respected.

51:31.639 --> 51:34.808
I'm sorry. You helped me at my lowest point.

51:34.809 --> 51:36.179
Don't be sorry.

51:37.309 --> 51:39.440
This is probably better for you anyway.

51:40.980 --> 51:42.150
All right.

51:42.570 --> 51:45.069
If your parents have already decided to go with her,

51:45.070 --> 51:46.239
what can I do?

51:48.909 --> 51:49.949
Well...

51:51.989 --> 51:53.159
All right.

51:55.369 --> 51:57.159
Hold on.

51:58.170 --> 52:00.670
Then should I just get going?

52:02.000 --> 52:05.670
Darn it. I wish you had given me a heads-up.

52:07.420 --> 52:10.429
Goodness. This is really awkward.

My gosh.

52:14.260 --> 52:16.218
Please take this back.

52:16.219 --> 52:20.269
No. I bought them for you, so just keep them.

52:20.349 --> 52:22.440

Oh, no.

53:32.760 --> 53:35.218
- Darn it. See this? - My back hurts.

53:35.219 --> 53:37.179
- Like this? - Okay.

53:37.389 --> 53:38.469
Keep it down.

What's the matter?

54:56.719 --> 54:58.800
She had an unexpected...

55:00.010 --> 55:01.218
- She had... - Did she tell you to say...

55:01.219 --> 55:02.639
that she had to step out?

55:02.719 --> 55:04.389
No. She's really not here at the moment.

55:07.650 --> 55:08.809
This is rude.

55:09.519 --> 55:11.230
She stole my case from me,

55:11.780 --> 55:14.489
and she's treating me like this? This is disrespectful.

55:16.780 --> 55:18.159
I'm not following.

55:18.280 --> 55:19.779
We met with Kim Hyun Soo's parents and...

55:19.780 --> 55:21.449
Look, Ms. Seo Soo Jin.

55:22.329 --> 55:25.909
That is called stealing.

55:29.630 --> 55:31.710
I'm sorry, but I do not agree.

55:34.130 --> 55:38.050
Ms. Seo, is this why you studied law?

55:38.840 --> 55:40.510
To be used in theft?

55:41.050 --> 55:44.428
To list these pathetic excuses?

55:44.429 --> 55:46.809
It can't be why you studied the Penal Code and the Civil Code,

55:47.269 --> 55:48.980
which is very hard to do.

55:49.519 --> 55:52.320
If you'd like to leave a message for her, I'll happily pass it along.

55:59.409 --> 56:02.780
Do I really have to say it?

56:03.119 --> 56:05.000
I'm sure you know why I'm here.

58:58.960 --> 59:00.710
inside a prison.

59:01.250 --> 59:04.800
It is not allowed, but this place is just like the outside world.

59:05.760 --> 59:08.090
It's possible for those with power.

59:09.429 --> 59:13.309
Cell phones, cigarettes, and meth.

59:16.559 --> 59:19.110

59:19.900 --> 59:21.940
Trading them without his permission...

Out of these mongrels,

1:00:17.869 --> 1:00:20.289
who could've traded cigarettes behind my back?

1:00:21.920 --> 1:00:22.920
Sorry?

1:00:31.679 --> 1:00:33.050
make him remember.

1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:47.239
But how...

1:00:47.900 --> 1:00:50.029
am I supposed to know?

1:00:50.030 --> 1:00:51.030
You will.

1:00:54.329 --> 1:00:55.329
You have to.

1:00:59.869 --> 1:01:01.630
He's known as Bone Breaker.

1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.130
He can break every bone in your body, you see.

1:01:10.130 --> 1:01:12.888
Please... Please don't hurt me.

1:01:12.889 --> 1:01:14.469
Please don't.

No, wait.

1:01:17.889 --> 1:01:19.889

1:01:20.599 --> 1:01:22.480
What if I really don't know?

You do.

1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:21.500
Because he is here.

He's not here.
