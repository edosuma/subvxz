<i>STEPHEN: Previously on
The Tomorrow People...</i>

00:02.731 --> 00:04.683
We can't let Roger get put in that machine.

00:04.800 --> 00:06.232
Why is that?

00:06.234 --> 00:08.867
Because it's a weapon, he
was supposed to be its engine.

00:08.869 --> 00:10.769
- Dad.
- Didn't mean to scare you.

00:10.771 --> 00:12.638
You're back.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.081
If he forces me into that machine,

00:14.082 --> 00:16.202
those people inside are all in danger.

00:16.244 --> 00:18.587
The Founder wants to use the
Machine to kill every man,

00:18.588 --> 00:20.815
woman and child on the planet.

00:20.817 --> 00:23.749
Natalie, we need to stay unified.

00:23.751 --> 00:26.885
I'm gonna make my own peace
with Ultra before his father,

00:26.887 --> 00:29.622
our absentee messiah,
blows everything to hell.

00:29.624 --> 00:31.224
Since you're so keen on mankind...

00:31.226 --> 00:33.426
perhaps you'd like to join them.

00:33.428 --> 00:35.661
So what exactly does that shot do?

00:35.663 --> 00:37.497
It allows us to keep track of our kind.

00:37.499 --> 00:38.563
See?

00:38.565 --> 00:40.732
That wasn't so bad.

00:40.734 --> 00:42.033
(THINKING) Goodbye, Stephen.

00:42.035 --> 00:43.368
CARA: What is it?

00:43.370 --> 00:44.436
I gotta stop her.

00:45.971 --> 00:47.539
It's time for you to die.

Now, that beats the hell out
of training with the Founder.

01:32.673 --> 01:33.673
You okay?

01:35.776 --> 01:37.309
Just...

01:37.311 --> 01:38.911
Promise me that we'll
look after each other.

01:41.181 --> 01:42.782
Okay.

01:42.784 --> 01:44.050
I promise.

01:44.052 --> 01:45.184
(SOFTLY) Okay.

02:16.816 --> 02:18.049
Hillary...

02:19.218 --> 02:20.653
That was close.

02:36.002 --> 02:40.138
Just to be clear, you want me
to pull the plug on your own lab.

02:40.140 --> 02:43.208
Yes, because right now they are
engaged in research on paranormals

02:43.210 --> 02:44.943
that will have catastrophic results.

02:44.995 --> 02:47.195
Sorry, but I never saw any appropriations

02:47.197 --> 02:50.098
for an Area 51 in the
middle of New York City.

02:50.100 --> 02:51.799
Of course you didn't.

02:51.801 --> 02:53.668
That's because I've kept the
nature of my work hidden from you...

02:53.740 --> 02:56.074
I've got a defense
authorization bill to pass,

02:56.076 --> 02:57.976
and you're talking about super-people?

02:57.978 --> 03:00.946
This must be a joke, tell me
there's a hidden camera, Doctor.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.713
Listen to me.

03:02.715 --> 03:06.884
Right now, their leader is poised
to eradicate the entire human race.

03:06.976 --> 03:09.110
Do you hear me? Hugh Bathory.

03:09.112 --> 03:11.245
You're saying he's a space alien?

03:11.247 --> 03:14.248
No, he is our evolutionary replacement.

03:16.117 --> 03:18.218
Oh, right.

03:18.220 --> 03:19.353
- (PHONE BUZZING)
- Thank you.

03:19.355 --> 03:21.922
I have a deranged man in my office.

03:21.924 --> 03:23.057
Wait a minute, no, you have to...

03:23.059 --> 03:24.358
Wait a minute!

03:24.360 --> 03:25.926
You have to listen to me.

03:25.928 --> 03:28.228
- What are you talking about?
- Calm down, Dr. Price.

03:28.230 --> 03:31.165
(YELLING) No, I'm not gonna calm down,
because he's gonna kill everybody!

03:31.167 --> 03:32.699
What is wrong with...

Oh, my God, you just
signed our death warrant!

What happened?

03:52.620 --> 03:54.287
Uh...

03:54.289 --> 03:57.190
(STAMMERING) I don't know. Hillary...

03:57.192 --> 03:58.824
She set off the bomb.

03:59.893 --> 04:01.394
Oh, my God. Is she...

04:02.929 --> 04:04.763
Stephen.

04:04.765 --> 04:06.899
What about the Founder?

04:06.901 --> 04:09.034
Survived.

04:09.036 --> 04:11.003
We have to go.

04:11.005 --> 04:13.072
No.

04:13.074 --> 04:15.874
(SNIFFLING) No, I... I spent
a year trying to find you.

04:15.936 --> 04:17.935
I killed myself pulling you out of limbo.

04:17.938 --> 04:21.439
We are finally together again
as a family, we are not running.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.308
The Founder knows I'm alive.

04:23.310 --> 04:25.177
He needs me to power up the Machine.

04:25.179 --> 04:28.346
If he succeeds, human beings are doomed.

04:28.348 --> 04:31.383
But if he can't use me,
then he'll use my son.

04:31.385 --> 04:33.251
This is what he's trained you for, Stephen.

04:33.253 --> 04:35.154
And where will you go this time?

04:35.156 --> 04:37.355
Whatever we do, we do as a family.

04:37.357 --> 04:41.293
I can't do what we did last
time, I won't live like a refugee.

04:41.295 --> 04:43.228
There is no life for this family,

04:43.230 --> 04:46.065
until the Founder and the
Machine are gone forever.

04:51.003 --> 04:52.804
Listen.

04:52.806 --> 04:54.371
CARA: Stephen?

04:54.373 --> 04:55.673
John...

04:55.675 --> 04:57.408
He was inside Ultra when the bomb...

04:57.410 --> 04:59.310
Yeah, I, uh...

04:59.312 --> 05:01.879
I saw him before the explosion.

05:04.149 --> 05:06.317
It looked like they were letting him go.

05:06.319 --> 05:08.186
That doesn't make sense,
if he's not at Ultra...

05:18.731 --> 05:19.731
John.

05:24.970 --> 05:26.136
You're alive.

05:29.941 --> 05:31.007
What happened?

05:31.009 --> 05:32.876
Stephen said that they were...

05:32.878 --> 05:34.144
Where've you been?

05:38.950 --> 05:41.118
Trying to find my way back to the Lair.

05:42.220 --> 05:44.821
Finally got in contact with Tim.

05:44.823 --> 05:46.390
Had him send Russell for me.

05:46.392 --> 05:47.991
Why didn't you just teleport?

05:50.228 --> 05:52.095
I can't.

05:52.097 --> 05:53.731
He took my powers.

05:56.334 --> 05:59.269
- No.
- The Founder set me free to give you a message.

05:59.271 --> 06:00.570
John.

06:00.572 --> 06:03.740
He said you need to
negotiate a truce with him.

06:03.742 --> 06:05.107
A real one this time.

06:05.109 --> 06:06.942
It's the only way to keep...

06:06.944 --> 06:08.110
your people safe.

06:08.112 --> 06:10.179
Our people.

06:10.181 --> 06:14.784
They'll end up like me unless you convince
the Founder that you're not the enemy.

06:14.786 --> 06:16.419
That's what he said.

06:16.421 --> 06:17.887
You gotta make a deal with him.

06:32.803 --> 06:35.104
So you got my message.

06:35.106 --> 06:37.306
You should've frisked me for a bomb.

06:37.308 --> 06:40.075
That wouldn't have been a wise move, Cara.

06:45.315 --> 06:47.349
Oh, you should see Hillary.

06:47.351 --> 06:49.151
Well, what's left of her.

06:50.787 --> 06:53.889
I've asked you here for one simple reason.

06:53.891 --> 06:56.125
I want Stephen's father.

06:56.127 --> 06:58.127
So, you bring Roger to me,

06:58.129 --> 07:01.763
and, uh, we'll let bygones be bygones.

07:01.765 --> 07:05.300
If you put him in the Machine,
all of humankind will be gone.

07:05.302 --> 07:06.835
So that's a "no"?

07:06.837 --> 07:08.169
(SCOFFING) That's a "hells no".

07:08.171 --> 07:09.904
Okay.

07:09.906 --> 07:11.372
You bring Roger to me,

07:12.441 --> 07:14.309
or I'll kill all of you.

07:14.311 --> 07:16.878
RUSSELL: You're gonna have
to try harder than that.

07:16.880 --> 07:19.848
Jedikiah threatened to kill us for years.

07:19.850 --> 07:23.751
You remember the injection you and your
friends received when you were last here?

07:23.753 --> 07:27.688
It's a tracer, and it
lodges in the cerebellum.

07:27.690 --> 07:30.892
It allows our network to monitor them.

07:31.927 --> 07:33.962
It also has a kill switch.

07:33.964 --> 07:35.429
(SCOFFING)

07:35.431 --> 07:36.930
Dude's bluffing.

07:36.932 --> 07:38.832
You think so, Russell?

07:38.834 --> 07:40.167
We are done here.

07:44.105 --> 07:45.138
Jody.

07:48.109 --> 07:49.977
That is your name, isn't it?

07:54.749 --> 07:56.283
Any last words for your friends?

07:57.418 --> 07:58.986
Don't listen to him.

07:58.988 --> 08:01.855
Oh, I know it's a lot of
pressure. In that case, uh,

08:01.857 --> 08:04.123
I'll just go with
something short and sweet.

08:07.060 --> 08:08.127
Like, "goodbye".

08:09.830 --> 08:10.830
(BEEPING)

08:12.065 --> 08:12.932
Jody

08:18.706 --> 08:20.006
You have one hour.

08:23.043 --> 08:25.344
And then I will kill
another one of your friends.

08:28.448 --> 08:29.715
Tick-tock.

ROGER: So if I don't turn myself in,
he starts killing you off one-by-one.

08:50.504 --> 08:52.236
Not all of us got the tracer.

08:52.238 --> 08:53.772
Thank God.

08:53.774 --> 08:55.273
Seriously, Marla? Not helping.

08:55.275 --> 08:56.875
Just try and stay calm, Russell.

08:56.877 --> 08:59.243
Yeah, easy for you to say,
you're not a walking time bomb.

08:59.245 --> 09:01.079
We're all on the same side, okay?

09:01.081 --> 09:02.447
This is what the Founder wants.

09:02.449 --> 09:04.748
For you to turn on each other
so that you'll turn on me.

09:08.019 --> 09:09.119
Give me a second.

09:11.990 --> 09:14.725
So while the Jamesons are enjoying
their little family reunion,

09:14.727 --> 09:17.795
the rest of us just get to stand
around here with our fingers crossed,

09:17.797 --> 09:19.129
hoping we're not the next to drop?

09:19.131 --> 09:20.664
We're building a strategy.

09:20.666 --> 09:22.265
The Founder has laid out a plan.

09:22.267 --> 09:23.667
The Founder can't be trusted.

09:23.669 --> 09:24.869
And Roger can?

09:26.538 --> 09:29.072
The rest of them are gonna freak out
when I tell them what happened to Jody.

09:29.074 --> 09:30.641
Natalie.

09:30.643 --> 09:32.543
There is no reason to stir the dirt.

09:32.545 --> 09:35.646
You have 52 minutes until
the next one bites the dust.

09:35.648 --> 09:36.913
What if it's you, Russell?

09:43.287 --> 09:46.256
We have to find a way
to deactivate the tracer.

09:46.258 --> 09:47.690
What, me?

09:47.692 --> 09:50.093
You have two PhD's, can you
create an antidote or something?

09:50.095 --> 09:53.497
Two unfinished dissertations, and
six digits worth of student loans.

09:53.499 --> 09:56.733
I mean, I don't even know how the
nano-agent inserts itself in the body.

09:56.735 --> 09:58.168
Well, can't you experiment on Russell?

09:58.170 --> 09:59.903
Get a sample, or something?

09:59.905 --> 10:02.172
You said it binds to
the person's cerebellum,

10:02.174 --> 10:04.941
as in "brain," as in, "I'm
not a flippin' brain surgeon."

10:04.943 --> 10:06.542
Have you seen her eat
with a fork and knife?

10:06.544 --> 10:08.244
No way I'm letting
Irene cut open my nugget.

10:08.246 --> 10:10.746
What if the person was already dead?

10:10.748 --> 10:11.847
You mean Jody.

10:11.849 --> 10:13.649
You're gonna cut open Jody's head?

10:13.651 --> 10:15.184
His or yours.

10:15.186 --> 10:17.520
- We will get you your sample.
- CARA: No.

10:17.522 --> 10:19.721
Russell, not you.

10:19.723 --> 10:20.789
CARA: John.

10:20.791 --> 10:22.291
Uh, but John's...

10:22.293 --> 10:24.693
Human, not useless.

10:25.728 --> 10:27.596
JOHN: Teleport me, I'll ride shotgun.

10:27.598 --> 10:28.797
Speaking of...

10:31.634 --> 10:33.001
Russell, you're in charge while we're gone.

10:34.137 --> 10:37.272
You have 45 minutes to figure this out.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.975
Jody's death is on the Founder.

10:40.977 --> 10:42.477
The next one's on us.

10:45.247 --> 10:48.716
It took Jonas Salk seven years
to create the polio vaccine.

10:48.718 --> 10:51.286
I'm not even technically
a molecular geneticist.

10:51.288 --> 10:53.388
What about Jedikiah?

10:53.390 --> 10:57.559
<i>TIM: Actually, Dr. Price was just
admitted to the Tribeca Psychiatric Center</i>

10:57.561 --> 11:00.095
for a 72-hour evaluation.

11:00.097 --> 11:04.265
Something to do with a hallucinatory
episode at a government office building.

11:04.267 --> 11:05.800
What was he doing there?

11:05.802 --> 11:08.703
Might have been trying to
go behind the Founder's back.

11:08.705 --> 11:11.606
So, what, we draw straws
to see who rescues Jedikiah?

11:11.608 --> 11:13.708
No, I think I know who we can send.

11:16.578 --> 11:18.846
Doctor, while you are
sitting there, taking notes,

11:18.848 --> 11:22.216
the fate of humankind hangs in the balance.

11:22.218 --> 11:23.618
Well, okay, I know it sounds nuts,

11:23.620 --> 11:25.820
but the future always seems
impossible until it happens.

11:25.822 --> 11:29.256
(HYSTERICAL) Do you think the Founding
Fathers envisioned a moon landing,

11:29.258 --> 11:30.625
for crying out loud?

11:32.260 --> 11:33.559
I'm joking.

11:33.561 --> 11:36.162
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
I'm kidding, it's a joke.

11:36.164 --> 11:39.833
I'm friends with the senator, I thought
he could take a joke, for crying out loud.

11:39.835 --> 11:42.201
- (AGITATED) What are you writing?
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

11:45.205 --> 11:46.840
I brought a sedative, Doctor.

11:54.882 --> 11:55.915
Ow.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.487
The patient should be
out for a couple of hours.

12:01.489 --> 12:02.688
I'll keep an eye on him.

12:13.534 --> 12:15.134
What, what... what are you doing?

12:15.136 --> 12:17.236
You should wear more white,
it really brings out your eyes.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.178
Left in an alley by Ultra.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.612
Jody deserved better.

12:30.149 --> 12:32.950
- Freeze!
- Take it easy.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.118
Just back up.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.690
I got this. Go.

12:40.793 --> 12:41.793
JOHN: Go.

12:43.162 --> 12:44.796
That's it. Keep going.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.667
I want you to teleport
him back to the Lair.

12:49.669 --> 12:50.935
- John said he's...
- I'm not arguing with you, Stephen.

12:52.805 --> 12:54.105
JOHN: All right.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.573
I'm not gonna hurt you, it's all good.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.274
Just put the gun down.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.077
- That's it.
- GUARD: Drop your weapon.

13:16.928 --> 13:18.095
Freeze! I said freeze!

13:23.300 --> 13:24.267
Don't!

13:29.140 --> 13:31.774
I just warned them that
paranormals were a threat.

13:31.776 --> 13:33.375
I mean, this is what evolution is.

13:33.377 --> 13:36.011
The more advanced species
supplanting the obsolete one.

13:36.013 --> 13:37.913
Pretty crude reduction of Darwinism.

13:37.915 --> 13:40.750
Crude or not, survival
of the fittest holds true.

13:40.752 --> 13:44.186
The Neanderthals died off with the arrival
of Homo sapiens, and now Homo sapiens...

13:44.188 --> 13:46.789
Neanderthals were not eliminated by humans.

13:46.791 --> 13:48.057
They made us possible.

13:49.459 --> 13:53.229
FYI, 70% of our dermal
layer is Neanderthalic code.

13:53.231 --> 13:54.730
Yeah, well, you know what?

13:54.732 --> 13:56.865
I'd rather be alive than the
blueprint for somebody else's skin.

13:56.867 --> 13:57.932
Thank you very much.

13:57.934 --> 13:59.500
That's what evolution is.

14:08.110 --> 14:10.711
But, this is about her.

14:11.814 --> 14:12.847
IRENE: Morgan.

14:13.983 --> 14:16.584
You're human, she's paranormal,

14:16.586 --> 14:19.654
and you're playing both sides
of it, like Romeo and Juliet.

14:19.656 --> 14:20.855
That's so romantic!

14:23.925 --> 14:25.092
She's pregnant.

14:27.796 --> 14:30.130
And you don't know if the
kid's gonna be like you, or...

14:30.132 --> 14:33.000
The laboratory is no place
for this kind of emotion.

14:33.002 --> 14:35.202
I think it's a good thing to have a heart.

14:35.204 --> 14:37.237
Even for a scientist.

14:37.239 --> 14:40.040
Great, can you take your heart
and get me some coded slides?

14:49.217 --> 14:50.750
I'll take you down.

14:50.752 --> 14:51.751
No.

14:52.854 --> 14:54.121
I'm not coming with you.

14:56.191 --> 14:59.626
You didn't listen to me
when I told you to leave.

14:59.628 --> 15:02.095
You used your powers in front of humans.

15:02.097 --> 15:04.564
I didn't have a choice.

15:04.566 --> 15:07.567
Six inches to the left, and that
guard's bullet would have killed you.

15:09.570 --> 15:12.105
I put you in that position
because I was vulnerable.

15:15.176 --> 15:17.210
I know you'd never cut me loose.

15:17.212 --> 15:18.645
So I'm doing it for you.

15:52.388 --> 15:54.255
You got 26 minutes.

15:54.257 --> 15:57.024
Till the Founder hits
the kill switch again.

15:57.026 --> 15:59.960
Tell me you found a way to
get this thing out of my brain.

15:59.962 --> 16:02.930
Irene and Jedikiah are working on it.

16:02.932 --> 16:05.432
You think he gives a rat's ass about us?

16:05.434 --> 16:07.334
Jedikiah knows what's at stake.

16:07.336 --> 16:12.139
Yeah, the lives of a species he's
spent his whole life trying to kill.

16:12.141 --> 16:15.509
Honestly, I'm really starting to
wonder who has my back down here.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.187
Irene, check this out.

16:32.893 --> 16:34.794
You ever seen that before?

16:34.796 --> 16:37.396
Adsorption / Replication.

16:37.398 --> 16:39.498
The tracer cells are going
through the Lytic Cycle.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.400
- In a dead body.
- What does that mean?

16:41.402 --> 16:43.302
The tracer's acting like a virus.

16:43.304 --> 16:46.105
- A kind of mechanical cancer.
- Only it's bonding to certain cells.

16:46.107 --> 16:48.440
How are the tracer's connected
to the Founder's network?

16:48.442 --> 16:50.409
It's a low-frequency cellular signal.

16:50.411 --> 16:52.488
Okay, if it's acting like a cell phone,

16:52.489 --> 16:54.261
can't we just knock down the cell tower?

16:54.983 --> 16:58.850
Interesting, but until we know how
the tracer's operating inside the host,

16:58.852 --> 17:03.121
we don't know if anything we do
to stop it will, in fact, stop it.

17:03.123 --> 17:06.023
Tim, can you pinpoint
the source of the signal?

17:06.026 --> 17:08.993
<i>TIM: Assuming it uses
a spread-spectrum signal,</i>

17:08.996 --> 17:12.830
I should be able to decrypt
the transmission security key.

17:12.833 --> 17:14.499
Great, tell me when it's done.

17:14.501 --> 17:16.367
MARLA: Okay, so if I'm gonna
be a part of this fight,

17:16.368 --> 17:18.837
I feel like I should know
what I'm doing, right?

17:18.839 --> 17:20.038
(ROGER CHUCKLING)

17:21.440 --> 17:23.339
You know how to use one of these?

17:23.342 --> 17:25.209
A stick?

17:25.211 --> 17:26.542
- For what?
- (CHUCKLING)

17:26.545 --> 17:27.877
To protect yourself.

17:31.983 --> 17:36.320
We can't kill our enemies, but we
can do things they can't even imagine.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.823
As long as we use that to our advantage.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.124
We can protect ourselves.

17:43.461 --> 17:44.995
And everyone we love.

17:46.198 --> 17:47.397
Pretty slick.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.965
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

17:52.837 --> 17:55.071
(LAUGHING)

17:55.073 --> 17:57.006
Not so bad yourself.

17:57.008 --> 17:58.341
(LAUGHING) Thank you.

18:01.411 --> 18:04.280
So this is what you were doing
all those years you were gone.

18:04.282 --> 18:08.151
You were building this place,
teaching those kids how to fight.

18:08.153 --> 18:09.886
Seems pretty trivial now.

18:09.888 --> 18:10.954
It's incredible.

18:12.389 --> 18:14.357
I'm just sorry you had to do it alone.

18:20.196 --> 18:21.429
Now show me again.

18:31.340 --> 18:32.374
Hey!

18:36.980 --> 18:37.980
You okay?

18:39.982 --> 18:41.849
I didn't know who else to call.

18:49.357 --> 18:51.259
Who did this to you?

18:51.261 --> 18:52.526
A security guard.

18:54.062 --> 18:55.863
Slightly harder to avoid when you

18:55.865 --> 18:57.231
can't teleport.

19:00.035 --> 19:02.170
They took your powers?

19:02.172 --> 19:03.838
Well, that's not the worst of it.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.071
Come on, I gotta tell you somethin'.

19:12.314 --> 19:13.314
Stephen?

19:14.449 --> 19:16.317
You're lurking.

19:16.319 --> 19:19.320
Why don't you go train with your
dad, or something, thank you.

19:19.322 --> 19:22.323
<i>TIM: I believe I've found
a diversion for you, Stephen.</i>

19:22.325 --> 19:24.297
<i>The relay array for the Founder's network</i>

19:24.298 --> 19:28.362
<i>is located within the Long Lake
Dam, in the Adirondack mountains.</i>

19:28.864 --> 19:30.430
Let's go.

19:30.432 --> 19:34.367
<i>I should mention that the
facility is on lease from the DOD.</i>

19:34.369 --> 19:36.970
How do you think Ultra pays
for all their fancy toys?

19:36.972 --> 19:40.073
This is way too risky, Stephen,
we're talking about the US government.

19:40.075 --> 19:42.809
Let's just see what Igor and Dr.
Frankenstein can come up with.

19:42.811 --> 19:44.544
Wait, which one am I?

19:44.546 --> 19:45.778
(MAN SCREAMING)

19:50.852 --> 19:53.419
LUCA: She just... she fell
down and started bleeding.

19:53.421 --> 19:54.854
What happened to her?

19:56.323 --> 20:00.092
60 minutes. That's how long you
have before someone else dies.

20:42.734 --> 20:45.001
These are the exact
coordinates Tim gave us.

20:45.003 --> 20:46.115
Our friends are walking IED's.

20:46.316 --> 20:48.084
We probably should have Google Mapped it.

20:49.074 --> 20:50.641
It's not your fault, you know.

20:50.643 --> 20:52.443
They're counting on us.

20:52.445 --> 20:54.344
I meant Hillary.

20:54.346 --> 20:56.647
What she did, you shouldn't blame yourself.

20:56.649 --> 20:58.348
I don't.

20:58.350 --> 20:59.783
It's no use lying to me, Stephen.

20:59.785 --> 21:01.952
Okay, Cara, out of my head.

21:01.954 --> 21:04.721
- I'm just trying to...
- No, no, you hack into people's brains.

21:04.723 --> 21:06.089
You learn their vulnerabilities,

21:06.091 --> 21:08.759
but you don't let anyone know
how you're really feeling.

21:08.761 --> 21:10.726
That is because I am scared.

21:11.862 --> 21:14.330
You want to know how I'm feeling?

21:14.332 --> 21:16.031
My friends are dying

21:16.033 --> 21:18.434
and I am second-guessing every
decision I have ever made.

21:18.436 --> 21:21.437
Only I can't admit that because I
am supposed to be the strong one.

21:23.006 --> 21:24.440
And now John's gone,

21:24.442 --> 21:26.809
and I am doing everything
I can not to fall apart.

21:28.411 --> 21:29.745
That is how I am feeling.

21:35.853 --> 21:37.453
John was just trying
to get out of your way.

21:40.056 --> 21:41.290
Out of my way?

21:42.626 --> 21:43.726
Right.

21:44.895 --> 21:46.428
I'm scared too, Cara.

21:48.298 --> 21:49.664
You already knew that.

21:53.669 --> 21:55.036
So that's it? You just...

21:55.038 --> 21:58.540
you just called me to tell
me the world is going to end?

21:58.542 --> 22:00.274
I thought you wanted a heads up.

22:00.276 --> 22:02.777
A chance to say goodbye if it came to it.

22:02.779 --> 22:04.779
Okay, well what are you doing to stop it?

22:06.015 --> 22:08.517
Coming to terms.

22:08.519 --> 22:09.851
What else can I do?

22:09.853 --> 22:11.986
I've lost my powers and now...

22:11.988 --> 22:15.923
You know, John. Your powers
are not what make you useful.

22:15.925 --> 22:18.559
Or important, or funny, or kind,

22:18.561 --> 22:19.860

a mini bottle of vodka.

22:31.874 --> 22:33.741

23:13.746 --> 23:15.347
Why are you hiding all that courage?

23:42.274 --> 23:43.609
Shut the front door.

23:45.678 --> 23:48.647
- What?
- I've always suspected that multiple genes

23:48.649 --> 23:51.649
working in tandem create the
Tomorrow Person adaptation.

23:51.651 --> 23:54.719
No, it's impossible to identify
those contributing markers.

23:54.721 --> 23:56.887
Trust me, I've been
trying to do it for years.

23:56.889 --> 23:59.824

- It's a magnet.
- That's what makes me special.

24:15.642 --> 24:17.875
Nothing more than a few hundred
carefully placed proteins.

24:17.877 --> 24:21.411
I have been looking for this for 20 years

24:21.413 --> 24:24.782

(EXCLAIMING) Yes, the
applications are endless.

24:34.460 --> 24:36.894
I mean we can identify breakouts in utero.

24:36.896 --> 24:40.865
Amplify existing powers,
counter bio-weapons.

24:40.867 --> 24:42.667
If more of these genes are out of sequence,

24:42.669 --> 24:45.736
we can transplant them
directly into human DNA.

24:47.472 --> 24:49.806
And Homo sapien becomes Homo superior.

24:51.441 --> 24:53.342
IRENE: Theoretically.

24:53.344 --> 24:54.944
But it still doesn't answer the question,

24:55.946 --> 24:58.214
"How do we disable the tracer?"

24:58.216 --> 25:00.416
And if we don't figure that out soon,

25:00.418 --> 25:03.486

We have to be ready.

25:30.714 --> 25:32.281
You remind me so much of my dad.

25:33.383 --> 25:34.850
Thank you. That's not a compliment.

25:36.886 --> 25:39.822
Sorry, but doesn't it strike
anybody else as strange that

25:39.824 --> 25:43.392
we're taking orders from a guy
who was a popsicle for six years?

25:43.394 --> 25:46.262
No offense, Roger, but you
didn't really live up to the hype.

25:46.264 --> 25:48.264
Ahem, would you give us a sec?

to take us to Wonderland

25:55.305 --> 25:56.938

picks another lucky winner...

26:02.679 --> 26:05.413

Because he's the Chosen One?

26:13.323 --> 26:14.322
Did you?

26:16.825 --> 26:18.393
Look.

26:18.395 --> 26:21.595

Look.

26:46.889 --> 26:48.221
That's it.

26:55.497 --> 26:57.798
Okay. How do you want to do this?

27:04.973 --> 27:07.574
Camping... you know, got lost, heh...

27:07.576 --> 27:10.243
This government facility
is restricted access.

27:10.245 --> 27:11.678
I'm pretty sure you two don't have it.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.447
Or tents for that matter.

27:25.426 --> 27:26.960
This goes two ways.

27:26.962 --> 27:29.429
Keep your hands up, cooperate with me.

27:29.431 --> 27:30.830
Or?

27:30.832 --> 27:33.366
Or they find your bodies in the icy river.

27:33.368 --> 27:34.434
No third option?

27:53.886 --> 27:55.354

- You okay?

28:30.922 --> 28:32.356
How did you do that?

28:33.892 --> 28:35.458
TK blast?

28:35.460 --> 28:36.960
Pretty sure you taught me.

28:36.962 --> 28:38.996
How many are down there still?

28:38.998 --> 28:40.430
I'm just getting one.

28:40.432 --> 28:41.564
Okay, stay here.

28:41.566 --> 28:43.333
- No, I can come with you.
- Cara,

28:43.335 --> 28:45.402
keep pressure on your arm. Stay here.

28:49.339 --> 28:51.474

29:18.184 --> 29:19.950

29:22.655 --> 29:23.987
<i>CARA: He has a wife,</i>

29:23.989 --> 29:26.023
Eve and a daughter named Jordan.

29:26.025 --> 29:28.824
Think of your wife, Eve?

29:28.826 --> 29:30.226
Your little girl, Jordan?

29:31.328 --> 29:33.629
1100 Briar Patch.

29:33.631 --> 29:37.600
Sitting at home, 1100 Briar
Patch Road, Plattsburgh?

29:37.602 --> 29:39.702
How do you know this stuff?

29:39.704 --> 29:41.871
I know you want to see them again.

29:41.873 --> 29:44.040
Which is why you're going to shut it down.

29:44.042 --> 29:45.141
Now.

29:46.877 --> 29:48.111
Alright, alright.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.319
(MACHINE POWERING DOWN)

29:56.321 --> 29:58.020
It's done. The whole system's dark.

29:58.022 --> 29:59.188
Good.

29:59.190 --> 30:00.822
It has to stay that way.

30:00.824 --> 30:02.057
(YELLING)

30:17.140 --> 30:20.209
So... you sure you want to do this?

30:20.211 --> 30:22.611
Well, I have to.

30:22.613 --> 30:24.345
Can't save the world from up here.

30:24.347 --> 30:25.913
I gotta go there.

30:25.915 --> 30:28.849
And you're not going
back for any other reason?

30:31.353 --> 30:33.020
'Cause back there when...

30:34.223 --> 30:35.323
When I kissed you.

30:43.798 --> 30:44.999
It's my lucky jacket.

30:46.268 --> 30:47.868
I'll be back for it.

30:49.738 --> 30:51.772
Hold on.

30:51.774 --> 30:53.573
(BELL RINGING) (BANGING)

31:03.785 --> 31:06.286
Astrid, when I kiss you next time.

31:06.288 --> 31:08.689
It's not going to be
because the world's ending.

31:14.327 --> 31:16.328
No use trying to take the Founder head on.

31:16.330 --> 31:18.164
We need to be strategic.

31:18.166 --> 31:20.033
We strike here and here.

31:20.035 --> 31:22.101
Simultaneously.

31:22.103 --> 31:24.771
We should be inside Ultra
before they sound the alarms.

31:24.773 --> 31:27.874
Our priorities. The human
guards, and the agents.

31:28.909 --> 31:31.377
Then it's just us against the Founder.

31:31.379 --> 31:32.779
Roger that, Roger.

31:35.248 --> 31:37.649
That still doesn't get
these bombs out of our heads.

31:37.651 --> 31:40.919
If we don't take him down, he'll
kill every human being on the planet.

31:40.921 --> 31:42.721
And?

31:42.723 --> 31:44.856
The Founder already said he's gonna
kill everyone who got a tracer until

31:44.858 --> 31:46.992
he gets his hands on you.

31:46.994 --> 31:49.027
While we're fighting amongst ourselves,

31:49.029 --> 31:52.097
the Founder is sitting in his office
with his finger on that button.

31:52.099 --> 31:55.967
The more we talk, the closer
we get to someone else dropping.

31:55.969 --> 31:58.937
If I only have a few
minutes left to live, I...

31:58.939 --> 32:01.272
I'm trying to do the right thing.

32:01.274 --> 32:02.607
Exactly.

32:04.276 --> 32:06.078
We can't let the Founder
turn us into killers.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.547
We're killers either way, Roger

32:11.684 --> 32:12.883
(BEEPING)

32:15.688 --> 32:17.222
Russell.

32:17.224 --> 32:19.290
Don't do this.

32:19.292 --> 32:20.858
I'm sorry, Roger.

32:28.934 --> 32:30.668
(GRUNTING)

LUCA: Dad, no!

32:35.974 --> 32:37.308
What was that?

32:41.178 --> 32:43.179
What are you doing?

32:43.181 --> 32:45.081
Testing a theory.

32:45.083 --> 32:46.750
Stephen is going to stop it.

32:49.520 --> 32:50.987
(GRUNTING)

32:58.996 --> 33:00.130
Stop!

33:09.673 --> 33:11.274
Russell, let him go.

33:22.852 --> 33:24.219
I don't want to hurt him.

33:24.221 --> 33:25.821
Natalie, stop!

33:25.823 --> 33:28.623
You let go of your husband,
and I'll let go of your son.

33:35.298 --> 33:36.564
It's okay.

33:38.301 --> 33:39.834
I'll be alright.

33:39.836 --> 33:41.202
- Roger, no.
- Shh!

33:42.738 --> 33:44.238
I'll never stop loving you.

34:23.152 --> 34:24.620
We brought your guy.

34:24.621 --> 34:27.188
Yeah, so maybe it's time
for you to stop killing us.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.492
Hello Roger.

34:29.494 --> 34:32.962
Seems like your sewer rats
weren't as loyal as you'd hoped.

34:34.130 --> 34:36.098
(SCREAMS)

34:36.100 --> 34:39.367
Hey! What about the tracers?
We want them out of our heads.

34:39.369 --> 34:40.768
Now.

34:40.771 --> 34:42.203
A deal's a deal.

34:48.344 --> 34:50.277
Oh, would you look at that?

34:50.280 --> 34:52.313
Somebody's pipped me to the post.

34:52.315 --> 34:54.483
Taken out my network.

34:54.485 --> 34:58.319
- What?
- Guess one of your friends, perhaps.

34:58.321 --> 35:02.123
Well, either way, we
still get our happy ending.

35:02.125 --> 35:05.960
All of our species get
to survive and thrive.

35:05.962 --> 35:07.895
Well, almost all.

35:27.348 --> 35:28.983
Anyone home?

35:31.987 --> 35:33.987
Hey, how'd you get down here?

35:33.989 --> 35:35.989
Four miles of steam tunnels.

35:35.991 --> 35:37.224
Where is everyone?

35:37.226 --> 35:39.159
I don't know, we just got back.

35:39.161 --> 35:40.894
Stephen.

35:40.896 --> 35:43.863
I never heard back from Russell,
so I forced my way into his head.

35:47.068 --> 35:48.968
And?

35:48.970 --> 35:51.438
Russell, Natalie, and a
few of the others, they...

35:54.409 --> 35:55.975
They took your father into Ultra.

35:57.011 --> 35:58.878
I guess they couldn't wait for us.

36:11.891 --> 36:13.359
Roger's in the Machine.

36:16.163 --> 36:18.297
Which means me and the rest of mankind

36:18.299 --> 36:20.533
aren't long for this world.

36:20.535 --> 36:22.368
Every war has its casualties.

36:25.272 --> 36:27.239
It's not too late, we can still stop it.

36:27.241 --> 36:29.341
- Take me topside.
- Why?

36:29.343 --> 36:30.642
Astrid's all alone up there.

36:32.546 --> 36:34.080
It's no way to die.

36:39.251 --> 36:40.985
- Oh, Stephen!
- Hey!

36:43.255 --> 36:45.022
There's nothing you could have done.

36:46.125 --> 36:48.326
Mom, The Founder, he's got Dad.

36:48.328 --> 36:50.161
He's going to put him in the
Machine, he's gonna use him...

36:50.163 --> 36:52.430
I know, your father said that the
further we are from the epicenter,

36:52.432 --> 36:54.232
the safer Luca will be.

36:54.234 --> 36:55.900
So we've gotta go now.

36:55.902 --> 36:58.336
You need to leave. I'm not coming with you.

36:58.338 --> 37:00.605
What? Of course you're
coming. We're a family.

37:00.607 --> 37:03.874
I have to stay here and stop this.

37:03.876 --> 37:05.343
- How are you going to stop it?
- I don't know,

37:05.345 --> 37:06.944
- but I have to try.
- Stephen.

37:08.481 --> 37:11.548
Hey. Hey you gotta get up, buddy.

37:11.550 --> 37:14.085
I need you to do something for me, okay?

37:14.087 --> 37:16.053
I need you to take care of Mom.

37:16.055 --> 37:18.188
No matter what.

37:18.190 --> 37:19.456
Alright, can you do that?

37:25.530 --> 37:27.665
I love you.

37:27.667 --> 37:28.966
I love you too.

37:30.535 --> 37:32.302
How did you get to be so brave?

37:34.006 --> 37:35.205
I learned it from you.

37:37.242 --> 37:38.408
