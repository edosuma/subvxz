WEBVTT

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
My stars and garters.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
President Ronald Reagan,

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
my hero.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Is this heaven?

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Oh, not just heaven,
Ruckus.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
White heaven.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000
You see,
there are many

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
different types
of people, Ruckus,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
so God created
many separate but,

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
well, for the most part,
equal heavens.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
: Folks, we are looking

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
You don't say.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
at some serious temperatures. How hot is it?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Well, let's just say it's hot.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
Hotter than the barrel of Dick Cheney's gun.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
This heat is relentless. Also coming up later today--

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
White heaven is
for decent, good

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
God-fearing Christians
who just happen to,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
well,
hate everyone

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
MAN: Wow, you look great.
WOMAN: Thank you.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
and everything relating
to black people.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
WOMAN 2: Hey!
MAN: You really look great.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
That means
no Muhammad Ali,

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
: Nobody predicted

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
the heat wave.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
no hip-hop music,
and no fucking Jesse Jackson.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
GIRL:
You want to come over

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
to my house?

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
But everyone seemed to be enjoying it.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
What about Whoopi Goldberg?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
GIRL: Yeah, ask your mom.
GIRL 2: Okay.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
Nope.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
They say the heat makes people crazy.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
Wow. This is heaven.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
WOMAN:
Hey, Bill.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
BILL:
Hey, how are you there, Gina?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
REAGAN:
Turns out that God

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
really doesn't have

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
GINA:
I love your flowers.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
that much of a problem
with racism.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
He doesn't even
remember slavery,

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
except in February.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Come on, everybody.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
Personally,
I hate black people, Ruckus.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
That's why I did
everything I could

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
to make
their lives miserable.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Come on, everybody.
What you waitin' for?

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Crack? Me.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
AIDS? Me.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Huh?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Reaganomics?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
Oh,
my hair!

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Hmph. Come on,
I'm in the name.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Riley.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
And God has rewarded me.
Know why?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
What?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
White people have pools.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Nigga, what's with the coat?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
Uh, 'cause two niggas
and two quarters

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
don't add up to a dollar?

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Well, that, and because
God loves white people.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
Hey. You quit playin'
with that white man water, boy.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
And if you teach everyone
on earth to love the white man,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
And you, turn off
that goddamn jungle noise.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
you too can join us
in white heaven.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
What?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
You heard me.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
Turn off that goddamn black,
African, Congo jungle noise!

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Praise white God.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Son of a bitch!

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm gonna show
your little black ass.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
You wait until they here.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Hello? 911. Breaker 911.
911 emergency.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
This is Uncle Ruckus.
I'm on Timid Deer Lane.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
A little monkey's sprayin' water
all down my esophagus

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
and hittin' my nether region.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
That's right, officer.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
He even done sprayed me
on my brand-new shirt

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
that I finally--

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Well, if it ain't
the brave men and women

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
of the police department
come save the day.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Get out of the truck
and show me some ID!

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
ID? Oh, that's
a fine idea, officer.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Can't be too careful.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I'm just gonna reach
into my pocket

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
and take out my--

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Gun!

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
Ah! Mr. Policeman, wait!

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Wait! It's a case
of mistaken identity!

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
HUEY:
Okay, so this meeting

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
of the executive board

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
Hey, watch out, now!

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
of the committee to free
Shabazz K. Miltonburough

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Please, not me.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
has now officially commenced.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
I got Indian in my family.
Seriously.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
Let's see now. Attendance.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
COP:
Hold your fire!

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
All in attendance say "here."

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Here.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Here.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
It's okay, officers.
It's okay.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Jazmine, Mrs. Wellington isn't
a member on this board.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
I have a backup wallet,
just in case.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
That's where I keep
my spare Blockbuster card.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Now, first item on the agenda:

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Gun!

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
our planned bus trip tomorrow

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Hey, what--?
What you all doing, here?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Ow-- Oh!
Ow! Oh!

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
to visit our illegally
imprisoned brother

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
I appreciate
what you're doing,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
and offer him moral support.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
but it's the wrong fellow.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Have we assembled
the reading material

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
HUEY: It was 90 degrees,

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
and baked goods
for Brother Shabazz?

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
and the temperature was rising.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Check.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
I have the latest edition
of  Highlights

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
and two and a half Fig Newtons.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Two and a half?

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Now, honey, you sure you have
enough water and a calculator?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Mrs. Wellington
got hungry.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
What about the snacks
for the two-hour bus ride?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
I have everything
I need, Daddy.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
I got part of a Lunchable and
a half a bottle of S-Snapple.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Oh. I can't believe
what happened to Ruckus.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Oh, so you
just wanna drink

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Morning, Huey.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
the white man's poison, huh?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
What a great day today.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
Whatever.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.000
I don't--

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
Huey Freeman, you're
the only person I know

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
High-fructose corn syrup.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
who can take a beautiful day
like this

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Read about it.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
and turn it into a problem.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
It'll kill you.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
What's that
box for?

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
Great.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
It's my soapbox.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
So we'll just get
a head count for the trip.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
If you have important things
to say, you use a soapbox.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Everybody who's going,
raise their hands.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Sir, would you
like to hear

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
about how the government
wants you dead by 62,

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Ah, come on, Jazmine.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
The man is on death row.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
so you can't collect
on social security?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
He needs moral support.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Is that true?

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
I'm not allowed to go past
the second light post.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Yes, but lemon juice can lead
to a longer, healthier life.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
I hope you don't treat me
like this when I'm on death row.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Oh. I'll take a cup.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I'll go next time.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
I promise.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Well, he'll be dead next time,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
but I'll tell him
you said, "Hi."

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
See? You depress him,

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
and I had a lemonade
ready to cheer him up.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
That's called synergy.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
This is uncomfortable.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Damn, it's hot.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
WOMAN:
The police were responding

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
to a call about
a broken fire hydrant

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
when they pulled over
the suspect

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
God bless you, Robert.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
How are you this fine morning?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
here on Timid Deer Lane.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
The officers
apparently mistook

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Hm?

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
the suspect's safety-orange
wallet for a gun

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
You're not a Jehovah Witness,
are you?

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
and shot at him 118 times,
and beat him.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
I'm in the Jehovah Witness
protection program.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
What did I see?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Robert, I'm dyin'.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Well, that brings up

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
That's right.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
an interesting
philosophical question.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
Went to the doctor
this morning.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Is it okay to snitch to
the police on the police?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
I only got six months
to live.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Tumor on the back.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Prozac can lead
to suicide.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
They call it
"biggus backus tumoritis,"

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
But lemonade
can lead to smiles,

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
or some other big word
that my tiny Negro brain

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
which can cause
dimples.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Dimples? I'll take two.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
and big lips can't pronounce.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Doctors say
they can't operate.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Thank you.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.000
But praise be to white God
and his son, white Jesus.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
You're good for business.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Well, I'm sorry to
hear that, Ruckus.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
You're not contagious,
are you?

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Just contagious
with the Holy Spirit

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
WUNCLER:
What's this here?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
of our Caucasian Savior.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.000
"Jazmine's Lemonade Parade."

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I'm on a mission from God,

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
The E's are backwards.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
and let me share
his word with ya.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Interesting.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Come,
child of God.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
Well, Jaz, look,
I'm a very powerful man

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Come.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
with a very powerful thirst.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Do you know
what's going on?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
What do you recommend?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
RUCKUS:
Please, everybody.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Lemonade.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Lemonade was a popular drink
in my day,

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Everybody, gather around
to hear the good news.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
and it still is.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
God is white, and he loves
the white man above all others.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
One lemonade, please.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
One dollar please,
Mr. Wuncler.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
All right!

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
How's business?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Woo-hoo!

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah!

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Not good enough.
I'm saving for a pony.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Yeah!

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Ye--! Sorry.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
A pony?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
RUCKUS:
Don't be sorry, white man.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Wow. Those can be pricey.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Only niggas and Mexicans
are sorry.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Be joyful.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Like, a couple hundred bucks.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
God loves you.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
I know.
I'm like, "Hey, guys,

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
That's why he made his only
begotten son in your image.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
I could buy a car
for that much."

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
Talk about highway robbery.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
God hates darkies.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Highway robbery.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Well, actually, I'm more
of a caramel complexion.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
You know, I raise ponies.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
No.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
But I'm outraged
all the same!

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
Ah! Magnificent.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Hear ye, hear ye.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
White God is a good God.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
I admire entrepreneurship
in young people.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Even darkies can rejoice.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
For even ones cursed
with the skin of coal

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
You mean like them
12-year-old girls

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
who work in your sweatshops
in Indonesia?

05:58.000 --> 06:03.000
can enter the gates of paradise
if he hates his own blackness.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
That's right.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Every morning I wake up
and put one foot on the ground

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
In white Jesus' name, amen.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
and the other up the ass of
a 12-year-old Indonesian girl.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
What?
That's right, Robert Freeman.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
And if this country didn't have
unions and child labor laws,

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
You must hate thyself
to save thyself.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
maybe your generation
would understand

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
the value of hard work.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
But, uh...we're okay?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Excuse me?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
Like this little girl here.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
White people.
We--? We're okay, right?

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
I might have to check
with my accountants, but

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Of course.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Cool.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
what if I bought your stand
from you right now

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
So who among this flock
will join me,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
for the price of...

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
one little pony?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
so that the world can hear

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
the joyful message
of love and redemption?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Wow.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
You must be rich.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
Ruckus, you done lost it
this time.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Yes, I am.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
You really dying?

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
I'm not sayin'
I do have a videotape,

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
Praise God, yes, I am.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
but I'm not sayin' I don't,
either.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Heed the word, darkies.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
I think
you're onto something.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Hypothetically speaking,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
how much would you pay
for something like that?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Tell me more.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Well, I didn't exactly see what happened, per se.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Well, first of all, the Gipper
is standing at the Pearly Gates.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah, he's wearing
a all-white suit,

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
But I don't think we should jump to any conclusions.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
got some white
tennis shoes on.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
And as the assistant district attorney,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
HUEY:
At this point,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
we're resorting

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
I urge everyone to be calm.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
to what I call
desperation tactics.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Such as?

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Have you observed anyone not being calm?

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
MAN:
How the hell

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
do you expect me to do?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I'm doin'
not so great.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
I've sent anonymous letters
to the governor,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
No, I guess. Ha.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
threatening to expose
his gay lover.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
This neighborhood is actually handling the shooting

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
I wasn't aware
the governor was gay.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
of an unarmed black man pretty well.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
He probably isn't,

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
but I figure 10 percent
of the population is gay,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
What do you say, Jazmine?

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Why not make your next move
your best move, huh?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
and probably about half

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
the people cheat
on their spouses.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
Deal!

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
So I figure that plan has about
a 5 percent chance of success.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
"Make your next move
your best move"?

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
My lawyers will be by with
the paperwork this afternoon.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Better than nothing.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Huey.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
What?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
See ya, partner.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
You always say
I should have faith.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
And why in God's name
are you wearing that coat?

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
Well, that's me having faith.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
Random, anonymous blackmail.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
It's 90 degrees.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Huey, they turned down
the final appeal.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Bye, partner.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
The execution date
has been set.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
It's in two months.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Two months?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
My own pony.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I'm gonna name him
"Sammy Davis, Jr. the Pony."

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
That's so soon.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
I've had a long time
to come to peace with this.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
What do you think?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I think he just ripped you off.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
It's not over yet.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
I'd expect you to say that,
pony-hater.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Why don't you
just holler at him?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Shit, I don't know.
He's so detached.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Daddy! Daddy! Guess what?!

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
But he never even paid
for the...lemonade.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
We used to spend
all our yard time together.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
We used to lift weights
together every day.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
He doesn't even
spot me anymore.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I think
there's somebody else.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
Here's the contracts
for the lemonade stand.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
Jail nigga,

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
you gay.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
My little girl,

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
RUCKUS:
Well, you see, the blackness

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
in our skin represents sin,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
already selling out
for the first time.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
I'm so proud.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
which is why God wants us
to hate the black in us.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
WUNCLER:
Now, this pony,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Mr. Sammy Davis, Jr.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
MAN: Ooh.
MAN 2: That's interesting.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
will be your responsibility
from now on.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
Yes, yes.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
MAN 2:
Yeah.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
We'll keep him
at my stables

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Hate the sin, not the sinner.
MAN 2: Wow.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
until you can get
your own ranch,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
RUCKUS:
You got the point,

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
little girl.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
which I think
will be pretty soon.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
You can't go
to the Pearly Gates...

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Thank you, Mr. Wuncler.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
Do you believe
in God, Huey?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
No problem.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I believe in God.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Now, let's think
of some ways

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
First of all, I'm
gonna live forever.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
to manipulate people
emotionally,

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
But if I do die,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
so that they buy lemonade.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I'll go smack God
upside the head

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Hm.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
and go tell him to get me

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
a grilled cheese sandwich
and some tacos.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Those police officers
look thirsty.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
We should invite them over
for lemonade.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
When I want something

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
or I'm afraid about something,

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
I pray.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Well, guess I should let
you partners get to work.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Have you ever prayed?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
And I dare God
to say something.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
Oh, hey there,
Huey.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
I'll be like,

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
"Say something, God.
Say something.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
Oh. That is so
not appropriate, Huey.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Yeah, I thought so."

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You should pray
for Shabazz.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
So when do I get to see
Sammy Davis, Jr. the Pony?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
God'll get him out
of jail.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
They have to listen to him.
He's God.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
And if God say something,
I'll be like this: "Ooh!

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
When you learn how to run
a respectable business.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
Take that, God."

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
I'll be beatin'
God's jaw like,

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
Huh?

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
What the hell is up
with this sign?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
bli-gah!

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Blah!

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
What's this crude drawing
supposed to be?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Mm. Mm-hm.
Hm.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
Excuse me, Reverend.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
Hey, hey, I know you.
You Armstrong Elder.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
I-it's the m-m-magical
pony carriage.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I seen you

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
This looks like
a kid drew it.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
on the TV news.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
You the only darkie
that I ever seen

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
WUNCLER:
Look at this.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
make any sense
on the TV news.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Why are all the E's backwards?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Hallelujah!

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
I-- I-- It's supposed
to be c-cute.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
And you talk white too.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
That's very impressive
for a monkey, no offense.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
You think ignorance is cute?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Uh, none taken.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Well, I suppose you think
mental retardation

09:24.000 --> 09:25.000
Now, if you don't mind,

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
is downright adorable.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
I'd like to talk to you
about expanding your message.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Lemonade, now.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I bet you got
a white wife.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Yes, I do have a white wife.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
WUNCLER:
How is anyone

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
supposed to believe
you can make lemonade

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Can I see a picture of her?

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
when you can't
even spell it?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
How old are you?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
T-t-t-ten.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
It's called
Operation Black Steel.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
T-t-t-too damn old to be writing
your E's backwards, damn it.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
We should call it--

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
We're callin' it
Operation Black Steel.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I like that name.
We're not changin' it.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
WUNCLER:
Squirm, little worm.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
What happened?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
What's your suggestion?

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
It's okay,
Jazmine.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
"Jazmine and Huey's plan

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
You don't need him.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
What do you mean,
I don't need him?

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
to get his friend
out of jail."

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Well, you're not gonna let him
treat you like that.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Why's your name first?

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
What, you think ponies
grow on trees?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Because I thought
of the name.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
I'm callin' it
Operation Black Steel.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
What kind of question is that?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
It's a large,
four-legged mammal.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Suit yourself.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Or maybe I'm just supposed
to wait

10:02.000 --> 10:03.000
You'll be sorry.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
What?
Nothing.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
until I'm an old woman
before I get my pony.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Whatever.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
How am I gonna
look, Huey?

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Operation Black Steel
works as follows:

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
A 65-year-old woman
riding a pony.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
Shabazz K. Miltonburough  will be executed

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Jazmine, he's a crook.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
You just want everyone
to be miserable

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
exactly 63 days from now.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
because you're miserable.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
That night,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
And why are you wearing
that stupid coat?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
there'll be a candlelight vigil.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
I wish you'd go away.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Granddad,

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
who refuses to take an interest

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
in the fate of Brother Shabazz,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
will probably stay in the car and watch  Friday.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
"All the pigs' feet."
That's funny. Ha-ha!

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
HUEY: One hour before

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
Brother Shabazz's execution,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
HUEY: They say the heat

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
makes people crazy.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Oh, buck up, son.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
he will be taken from his cell

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I'm sure you'll
get me next time.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
and brought to the prison hospital,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Weatherman says it's gonna be hotter tomorrow.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
where he will receive his final examination.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
At precisely that time,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Pshh. I hope not.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
I'll fake a massive heart attack.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
WOMAN:
Somebody do something.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
MAN:
Where's his parents?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
: Folks, this heat

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
will not let up.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
MAN 2:
The kid's dyin', man.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
It is hot.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
And speaking of hot, Al Sharpton is hot right now,

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
That's so funny.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
"It's your ass,
Mr. Postman."

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
having a big old protest.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
HUEY: The guards

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
will have no choice

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Seems like Al's angry again at something.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
but to bring me into the prison hospital

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
I believe it's a cartoon this time.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
In fact, he wants to have all...

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
while Shabazz is there.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
They'll have no idea

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
I'm a black radical freedom fighter

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
until it's too late.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
I'll be able to tranquilize two of the guards right away.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
I want these tables cleaned
every hour on the hour.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
After that, I've got the stun baton.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
MAN:
Get some help.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Now, where's
my money?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
We got
a problem here!

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Well, don't stand there.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Lemonade ain't gonna
make itself.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
GUARD 2:
Clear the way!

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
If I see a single thirsty person
on this block,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
Come on, move! Move!

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
they'd better be broke.

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
HUEY: We'll be gone

11:24.000 --> 11:27.000
before they even know what hit.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
JAZMINE:
What happens then?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
It's gonna be hot today.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Then I move to Cuba
for the rest of my life.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
That's assuming I'm not killed
in the breakout.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
HUEY: A press conference was held

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Yeah.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
at Jazmine's lemonade stand

11:35.000 --> 11:38.000
to announce Ruckus' settle with the police department.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
This is a good plan.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
He turned down a seven-figure settlement offer.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
In fact, all Ruckus asked for

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
HUEY: Shabazz K. Miltonburough

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
was actually interning

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
was to fulfill a childhood dream

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
of being a police officer.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
for the Black Panthers in early 1970.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
He hadn't even earned

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
So help me God.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
his black beret and leather jacket.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
One fateful day, he heard a gunshot...

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
Congratulations,
Officer Uncle Ruckus.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
...and the words:
MAN: A Gun!

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
RUCKUS:
Thank you, thank you.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
I, Eli Gorbinsky,

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Thank you.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
You know--

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
hate deputy sheriffs.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
--people been asking me

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
if I'm upset
about what happened yesterday.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
In fact, I'd go so far as to say
I hate all police officers

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
I say, no.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
and parking enforcers.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Ruckus is not upset.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
And that's why I,

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Because the swift and measured
response of these officers

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Eli Gorbinsky,

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
shot this here
deputy sheriff!

12:11.000 --> 12:16.000
is a fine example of
my tax dollars hard at work.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
HUEY: Shabazz never investigated

12:12.000 --> 12:15.000
the gunshot

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
or the oddly expositional phrase Eli yelled out.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
And I just want you
all to know

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
But within minutes,

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
that I hope to live up to
the fine example of those men.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
the cops busted down the door...

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
What's going on?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
...to the Black Panther office supply shed

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
And I hope to harass and beat

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
and arrested Shabazz... What--?

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
each and every
black person I see

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
...for the murder of Deputy Sheriff Gary Fife.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
with "excreme" prejudice.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
GIRL:
That's a totally great idea.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Several people witnessed the murder.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
That's great.
Yeah.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.000
One had 8mm video footage.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
I'm glad you feel me
on that sentiment.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Another happened to be a stenographer

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
who had it all transcribed,

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Now, let's enjoy
some delicious lemonade

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
including Eli's confession,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
from this little
mix-breed girl.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
which he oddly enough signed and dated.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
That's an order
from Officer Ruckus.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
The murder weapon had Eli's prints all over it,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Oh, my rear.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
That's right, Bob.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
which were clearly visible,

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
I'm standing on
Timid Deer Lane in Woodcrest,

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
since he had been enjoying

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
a chocolate doughnut at the time of the shooting.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
where one little girl
has turned the lemon

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
There was also a receipt of sale attached to the gun,

12:53.000 --> 12:57.000
of shocking police brutality
into lemonade.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
and the manufacturer warranty card was filled out,

12:57.000 --> 13:01.000
Woodcrest isn't a place where people dwell on the past

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
signed and dated by Eli.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
During the trial,

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
and focus on the negative, like who shot at who 118 times,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
footage of the incident

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
confirmed the stenographer's note

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
that Gary's last words were actually,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
or who cracked whose ribcage.

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
"Eli Gorbinsky killed me."

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
That's all media hype.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
After only 20 minutes of deliberation,

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
In my day,

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
we resolved our differences the old-fashioned way:

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
Shabazz K. Miltonburough

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
over a cool glass of lemonade.
WOMAN:  Ow, my toe.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
was sentenced to death.
Guilty as charged.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
We just want everyone to know

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Man, ain't this a bitch?

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
that this was not racially motivated.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
And everyone is welcome to come to Woodcrest.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
RUCKUS:
Amen.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
White Jesus tells us:

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Uh, including the African-Americans.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
"In order to enter paradise,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
Just don't stay too long, darkies.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
we must hate ourselves
to save ourselves."

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Just kiddin'. Not really.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
Sound pretty simple,
don't it?

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I can't believe
this crazy fool

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
MAN: Come on, damn it.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
is actually tryin'
to start a church.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
MAN 2:
And you told me to come here,

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
and now I'm not gonna listen.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
HUEY: Ruckus had partnered up

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
MAN 3: Whatever.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
Let's see.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
with famous black conservative Armstrong Elders

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
I want a...

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
to market his "ministry."

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I'll take two small lemonades
with ice,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Elders was a media vet.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
two small lemonades
without ice,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
He knew just how to package Ruckus for the masses.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
three large lemonades,
one with ice,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
one with no ice,
one with crushed ice.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
: So you believe God is white?

13:54.000 --> 13:59.000
Do you guys have,
uh...mm-mmm...?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
First of all, white man,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
let me say
that I love you,

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
honor you,

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Uh...

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
envy you,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
enjoy your smell,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
That's all I got.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
and I celebrate you
in the name of white Jesus.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Lemonade is a dollar.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
That's all I got!

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Make it work.
I'm thirsty.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Lemonade is a dollar.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Um, thank you.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I ain't got no dollar.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
No, thank you.
Look at that.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
It's hot as hell out here, man.
Just hook me up.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
That's a handsome young man,
ain't it?

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
All the money
I spent up in this place,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Now, if God looked like
Isaac Hayes,

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
this is some ol' bullshit!

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
do you think his son
would look like this?

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
Lemonade is a dollar!

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
So black people are--?

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Cursed! Cursed! Cursed!

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Mm...

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
Uh, do you guys have anything
other than lemonade?

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Just look
around you.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
That's why we
in the ghettos.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
That's why we in jail.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Jazmine, this is stupid.
You're being exploited.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
That's why we on UPN.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
You'll never get anywhere
in this world

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Because God don't like us.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
without doing a fair day's work

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
You think if God wanted
to change that, he couldn't?

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
for a fair day's pay.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
Hell, he turned water to wine.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Jazmine, Ed's never
gonna give you that pony.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
He could have changed
UPN to CBS.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
Next.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Peaches, I think it's time
you come inside.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
Reverend Ruckus
and his peculiar message

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Can't talk, Dad.
Making lemonade.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
of race-based redemption

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Come on, honey,
I want you inside  now.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
has begun to spread, and fast.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
No!
I have been

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
waiting 20 minutes

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
How fast?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
for this lemonade.
I'm thirsty!

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Reverend Ruckus
will be holding a revival

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
What's the problem?

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
here at Woodcrest Post Pavilion tonight.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Mr. Wuncler,

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
you know, yesterday
I thought this was cute.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Tickets are expected
to sell out.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
But don't you think you guys
are taking this a little far?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Coming up next, time has run out

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
for a condemned man who many say is innocent.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
Jazmine can leave
whenever she wants.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
After this.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
I don't get it.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
But Sammy Davis, Jr. the Pony
will have to be put down.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
Who would actually follow
Uncle Ruckus?

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
We have to put a stop to this.
We're going.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
What?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
He's your pony now.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Your percentage was supposed to
pay for his food and upkeep.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
Yeah?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
I'm calling you
to say goodbye, Huey.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
And thanks for
everything you did.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
Now he'll starve to death
in a puddle of his own feces.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
It means a lot.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
It's not over.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
I promise.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
Oh, come on,
Mr. Wuncler.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
I can't say much

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
because I know
people are listenin',

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
I don't want to leave,
Mr. Wuncler.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.000
but...I promise you.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
Please, Daddy,
don't make me leave.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Goodbye, Huey.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
There you have it.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
You know the name of the game.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Your daughter chose me.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Now, we can handle this
like some gentlemen,

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
or we can get into
some old gangster shit.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Damn, Morpheus.
What you about to do?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
Mm...

15:46.000 --> 15:47.000
Okay, best of luck,
honey.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
I love you,
man.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Ugh!

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
: This heat will not stop.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Nigga, you gay.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
This portion of the program sponsored by

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
But, Granddad,
you promised to take me

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Jazmine's Lemonade Parade,

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
to the prison tonight--

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
a subsidiary of Wuncler Food Incorporated.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Not tonight.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Somebody has to talk
some sense into Ruckus.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.000
Oh, Wuncler. That's...

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Thank you.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
But I'm tryin'
to save my friend.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Me too.
But I promised him.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Come again, ma'am.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
I gave him my word
I'd be there.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
MAN:
I have to have a glass.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Hello. Bye.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
He's gonna die,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
WOMAN:
Come on, move it.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
My legs are sore.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
You should pray
for your friend, Huey.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
WOMAN 2:
Oh! Come on.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
That's all anyone
can do for him.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
: Martin Luther King

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
MAN:
Hey, kid!

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Huh?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
and the colored folks died before him--

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Wake up!

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
What makes your God any less
made up than his?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Some of us have to work
for a living.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
--dark chocolate soup.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
CROWD: Yeah.
MAN: She's taking too long.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
:
Oh, not another day.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
So hate the black within you.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
Row H, seats 44
and 45. Ha.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
MAN: No more child labor!
MAN 2: That's right!

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Let's roll.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
MAN 3: Hell no, we won't go!
WOMAN: Let's go!

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Hell no, we won't go!

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
HUEY: Operation Black Steel,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
We're gonna shut down
this lemonade stand

16:34.000 --> 16:37.000
the mission to liberate Shabazz K. Miltonburough,

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
and liberate that little girl.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
was aborted...

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
'cause I couldn't get a ride.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Yeah!
Right on, man!

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
People say to me,
"Ruckus?"

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Stop in the name of the law.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.000
I say,
"Huh? Who said that?"

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Just what the hell y'all
think y'all doing, here?

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
They say, "How do I make it
to white heaven?"

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Yeah,
quit making trouble.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Well, start by
asking yourself,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
We're thirsty.
Get lost.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.000
"How is my relationship
with the white man?"

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Let's get 'em!

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
Do you celebrate the white man's goodness every day?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
WOMAN:
Release the children!

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Let 'em run free, man.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Do you stop and thank the white man

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
What the hell are you doing?

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
for the food you eat and the clothes you wear?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
We're protesting.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Quit playing.
Let's shut it down.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Huh?

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
Well, if you don't,
you going to hell.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.000
This will shut it down.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.000
WOMAN 2: Yeah.
Just very slowly...

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
WOMAN 2: Children!
...and peacefully.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Now, I want everybody
who isn't white

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
We're gonna liberate that
girl one of these days.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
to turn to a white
person and say,

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Even if it's not
in our lifetimes, right?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
"Thank you."

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Thank you.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
Thank you so much.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Who's with me?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
Why don't you
leave me alone?

17:18.000 --> 17:22.000
Well, there are those of you
who say I'm a racist.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
I don't want
your help.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Jazmine,
there is no pony.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
There are those of you who say I'm wrong for hatin' niggas.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
There is too.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
He has a white tail.
I saw the picture.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Well, I call y'all all hypocrites,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
MAN: Look.
MAN 2: Hey, get some deodorant.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
because each
and every one of you

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
can name 10 niggas you hate
right now if you had to.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Ponies!

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Ponies!

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
Oh, my gosh,
look at the mane!

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
I never thought about it
like that.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
There's Tyrone,
Leon...

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Oh, my gosh!

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
Ladies and gentlemen...

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Oh, Eddie.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
it has been brought
to my attention

17:42.000 --> 17:45.000
You don't have to admit it,
that's okay.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
that Jazmine's Lemonade Parade
has been using child labor.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
'Cause I know you done
already counted off

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
five niggas in your head.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
Obviously, this comes
as a great surprise to me.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.000
You're like,
"I hate that nigga Jamal.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
So I present to you...

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
"Oh, I hate Otis.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.000
Wuncler's Cruelty-Free Lemonade.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
I can't stand Usher."

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
Oh, my God, he's right.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
It's lemonade, but without
the biting sting of injustice.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
I hate Usher too.
What?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
He's right.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
Its lack of cruelty
makes it look delicious.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I think I hate
black people.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Tom, stop
being stupid.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
And I know it's cruelty-free,
because he said so.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
No, I think
I hate them all.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
I don't like Puffy.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
And it's on the label.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
I don't like Kobe.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Sammy, I'm coming!

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
I don't like--
I don't like any of them.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Ow! Please, let me through.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Tom, snap out of it.
Come on. We're leaving.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
RUCKUS:
That's right.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Ow!

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
Somebody out there
is feelin' the Spirit.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Ugh! Please move.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
I am. I am! I feel it!

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
Ow!

18:22.000 --> 18:25.000
If you black of skin
and full of sin,

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Mr. Wuncler.
Let me see my pony.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
come forward, so I may
lay my hands on you.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Your pony?

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
You better check the contract,
young lady.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Hah!
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
HUEY: Wuncler's deal with Jazmine

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Black be gone.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
advanced her one $213 pony

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Hah!

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Praise white Jesus.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
against a five-point royalty,

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Hah!

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
which gave her 5 cents of every cup sold.

18:41.000 --> 18:46.000
That meant Jazmine had to sell 4260 cups of lemonade

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
RUCKUS: Now I want everybody

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
to find the nearest black man

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
before the pony was actually hers.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
and lay hands on him.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
She in fact sold 4376 cups.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
But, first, make sure your hand
is balled up in a fist,

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
so you can beat the black out of his soul.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.000
But what Jazmine hadn't calculated

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
God smiles when
you hate blackness,

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
was the cost of her new stand,

18:58.000 --> 18:59.000
marketing and promotion,

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
so you beat that darkie
in the name of the Almighty.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
the lemons, cups, umbrellas, straws,

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
and the gas to drive Wuncler back and forth from the stand,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Hallelujah!

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
all came out of her 5 percent.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Jazmine not only didn't get her pony,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
People have lost
their damn minds.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
she ended up about $300 in debt to Ed Wuncler.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
What's wrong with y'all?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Hey! Hey!

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
That's right.
Ronald Reagan said,

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
You know, Miss DuBois,

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
I sunk a lot of money
into this business.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
"Beat a nigga's ass
and go to heaven."

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I gave you an opportunity.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
God is good.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
But that's just not
good enough for you, is it?

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
You wanted a handout.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
I just want my pony.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I've never seen anyone
so ungrateful.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
HUEY: I never prayed before.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
This partnership is over.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
Sammy Davis, Jr. the Pony
belongs to me now.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
I don't even know who I'm praying to.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
And maybe I'm too young to know

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
No!

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Don't take Sammy.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
what the world is supposed to be...

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
I'm sorry.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I won't be ungrateful.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
but it's not supposed to be this.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
It can't be this.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Hey, cry about your failed
dreams on your own time.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
So please--

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
We want lemonade.
What's taking so long?

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
Hey, give us some of
that cruelty-free stuff.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Governor.
What is it?

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Hey, man, fuck y'all.
Get your own.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
They found out about Raoul.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
MALCOLM X: Today is time to stop singing

19:54.000 --> 19:58.000
and stop swinging.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Now, let us pray.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Lord, I have spent
my whole life hatin' you

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
HUEY: Maybe the heat does

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
make people crazy.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
for makin' me black.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.000
And now I see I must hate myself and all those like me,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
and cause them misery,

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
just like your servant
Ronald Reagan did.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
HUEY: Before you know it,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
crazy becomes normal.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
And if any of my words
don't come directly

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
from the Almighty God himself,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
Huh! Ha! Huh!

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
Get your black ass out of here.
Get out of here right now.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
then may I be struck by lightning

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
What's wrong?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
right this very instant.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Huh?

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Halle--!

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Gun!

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Huh?

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
Ow! Ow-- Easy. Excellent use
of a baton, officer.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
Ow! Ow! Ow!

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
HUEY: But sanity eventually returned.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
What just happened?

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
And when it does, you better have your coat.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Would somebody
like to get that?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
MAN:
Come here.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
WOMAN:
I'm so sorry.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
MAN 2:
That was bad.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
I think it's for me.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
WOMAN:
No, I was really to blame.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
MAN 2:
Here's your guitar.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
HUEY: The lightning bolt

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
that saved Shabazz's life

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
If you really
think about it--

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
seemed to have struck Uncle Ruckus on his tumor.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
WOMAN 2:
This is so stupid.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Over lemonade.
I mean, that's so dumb.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Doctors would find

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
MAN 3:
No, it was my fault.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
no remaining signs of his cancer.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Some called it a miracle.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
RUCKUS:
Uh, help me up.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
WOMAN 2:
That'd be great. Yeah.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
MAN:
It seemed to make sense.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
HUEY: And maybe there are forces

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
in this universe

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
we don't understand.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Huh? Wha--?

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
Get your black
banana-peelin' hands off of me.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
I s-s-shouldn't have taken
that n-nap.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
HUEY: But I still believe we make

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
our own miracles.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Have I ever told you about

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
I don't know how
they found out about us,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
J-J-Jazmine's Hot Chocolate
Explosion?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
but we have to
end it, Raoul.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
It would be a delivery service
for hot chocolate.

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
HUEY: Shabazz K. Miltonburough

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
was not yet free,

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I can charge a delivery fee
and get tips.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
RUCKUS:
Move along. Move along,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
but for now, the mission had been accomplished.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
There's nothing to see here.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
RUCKUS:
Oh, a unicorn.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
I decided to take the rest of the day off.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
I wonder if there's anything good on TV.
