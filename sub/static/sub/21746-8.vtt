00:33.666 --> 00:35.000
I am probably gonna kill you.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.601
But there's a chance
you can talk your way out of it.

00:37.625 --> 00:38.791
What do you want?

00:39.166 --> 00:40.291
Just the basics, really.

00:42.708 --> 00:44.375
Who are you?
And why did you kill my son?

00:49.958 --> 00:51.998
Chuck your gun down.
We're gonna have a little chat.

00:52.458 --> 00:53.791
Yeah, I know you too well, Jack.

00:55.333 --> 00:56.773
I've been screwed
by you once before.

00:56.833 --> 00:59.083
Why don't you put your
gun down and kick it to me?

00:59.166 --> 01:00.226
No, I never give up my gun.

01:00.250 --> 01:01.250
Yeah, well, no deal then.

01:03.083 --> 01:04.083
All right.

01:11.291 --> 01:12.291
I tell you what.

01:20.500 --> 01:21.958
I'm gonna kill your girlfriend.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.166
Go on, take a look.

01:24.750 --> 01:25.750
Whoa!

01:29.083 --> 01:30.083
Last chance.

01:31.625 --> 01:32.708
What the...

01:56.125 --> 01:57.208
Hey, Chief.

01:58.958 --> 02:00.791
That's your wife's car, asshole.

02:00.875 --> 02:02.583
You think you can knock down
a row of bikes

02:02.666 --> 02:04.066
and get away
without a shit kicking?

03:07.458 --> 03:08.458
Anna.

03:32.625 --> 03:34.166
Hi, this is Anna
leave a message.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.125
Anna, it's your mum.
Where are you?

03:38.208 --> 03:39.250
I'm worried about you.

03:40.333 --> 03:41.333
I love you.

03:41.833 --> 03:43.166
Call me right now, okay?

03:44.083 --> 03:45.083
Bye.

04:45.583 --> 04:46.625
Where are we going?

04:47.375 --> 04:48.416
Calgary.

04:50.416 --> 04:51.416
Why?

04:52.291 --> 04:53.958
You're going to give
a deposition.

04:55.291 --> 04:56.291
Shit.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.541
You know, I told you,
I'm not testifying.

05:00.375 --> 05:01.541
Don't you want justice?

05:16.500 --> 05:17.500
Are you for reals?

05:18.791 --> 05:20.208
Yeah, I'm for reals.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.250
So, how old are your kids?

06:16.666 --> 06:17.875
Four and six.

06:18.583 --> 06:19.583
Where are they?

06:19.625 --> 06:21.125
Toronto, with their father.

06:21.208 --> 06:22.208
And you're here.

06:23.166 --> 06:24.875
My exhusband's out of work.

06:25.625 --> 06:27.000
Someone has to earn the money.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.041
That's ironic.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.125
You leave your kids so that

06:32.208 --> 06:34.375
you can come work for the
same people who killed mine.

06:36.125 --> 06:37.125
I'm sorry.

06:38.916 --> 06:39.916
You're sorry?

06:42.125 --> 06:43.250
Yes.

06:44.958 --> 06:46.125
Just how sorry are you?

06:46.250 --> 06:47.083
What?

06:47.166 --> 06:50.125
How fucking sorry are you?

06:50.833 --> 06:51.833
Very!

06:51.875 --> 06:52.916
Very.

06:54.166 --> 06:55.375
That's a little vague.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.750
What exactly are you sorry for?

06:57.833 --> 07:01.083
Are you sorry that your
partner murdered a doctor?

07:01.166 --> 07:02.666
Or are you sorry

07:02.750 --> 07:05.833
that your company built
a leaky pipeline on our land?

07:06.083 --> 07:07.083
All of it.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.708
I'm sorry for all of it.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.083
Let's not stop there.

07:11.166 --> 07:13.291
Your people wouldn't even
have oil

07:13.375 --> 07:15.291
if your ancestors
didn't steal all our land.

07:15.958 --> 07:19.500
Or are you sorry
that we signed a treaty

07:19.583 --> 07:22.500
that was impossible
to understand?

07:22.583 --> 07:24.541
Are you talking about Treaty 6?

07:25.333 --> 07:27.125
Because that was 150 years ago.

07:27.250 --> 07:28.541
So fucking what?

07:28.625 --> 07:30.250
Are you sorry that

07:30.333 --> 07:33.125
you sold whiskey to us that
was laced with strychnine?

07:33.208 --> 07:34.041
What?

07:34.125 --> 07:37.666
Or that your people almost
wiped out all the buffalo?

07:38.125 --> 07:41.166
Or are you sorry
that you gave us smallpox?

07:41.250 --> 07:43.416
Okay, I'm not responsible
for smallpox.

08:12.333 --> 08:14.333
Wake me up when we get
to Little Big Bear.

08:16.416 --> 08:17.726
We're not going
to Little Big Bear.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.375
Gagnon's in Little Big Bear.

08:19.458 --> 08:20.750
We're going to Calgary.

08:21.750 --> 08:23.666
Yeah, but I'm out of Apache.

08:23.750 --> 08:24.583
What?

08:24.666 --> 08:26.833
Fentanyl pills. I'm all out.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.613
Are you going through
withdrawal?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.083
Well, not yet.

08:34.416 --> 08:35.500
Okay.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.625
I'll figure something out.

08:38.957 --> 08:40.375
- Just...
- Fuck, don't.

08:40.457 --> 08:41.457
"Trust me"?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.125
Fuck, well, I guess
I got no choice, do I?

09:03.291 --> 09:04.833
Hey, hey.

09:07.625 --> 09:08.625
Sorry.

09:12.208 --> 09:13.208
You want a ride?

09:15.458 --> 09:17.750
No, I didn't mean to flag
you down. I was just...

09:18.875 --> 09:19.875
Sorry.

09:45.666 --> 09:46.666
Hello, love.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.166
Jesus.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.125
My fault, right?

10:00.125 --> 10:01.791
With Pete, my fault.

10:03.833 --> 10:05.333
Supposed to keep my family safe.

10:05.416 --> 10:06.541
Fucked that right up.

10:35.666 --> 10:36.666
You want a drink?

10:46.208 --> 10:47.208
No.

11:11.958 --> 11:13.166
Where are you headed?

11:14.166 --> 11:15.166
Airport.

11:17.250 --> 11:18.250
All alone?

11:42.458 --> 11:43.750
It's me.

11:45.041 --> 11:46.458
Why the hell are you calling

11:46.541 --> 11:47.750
from my husband's cell phone?

11:47.833 --> 11:49.041
Just routed the call.

11:50.375 --> 11:51.708
It's easy when you know how.

11:54.708 --> 11:56.541
You know, I know a lot
about your family.

11:57.875 --> 11:59.708
I know your exhusband, Richard.

11:59.791 --> 12:02.958
He's a very talented, but,
sadly, unemployed journalist.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.250
And I know your two kids,
Katie and Tom.

12:07.666 --> 12:11.166
They live with him at
172 Arndale Drive, Toronto.

12:14.750 --> 12:15.750
It's easy.

12:18.083 --> 12:21.166
I also know that 4:00 tomorrow,

12:21.666 --> 12:23.625
Richard will collect Katie

12:23.708 --> 12:25.708
from her school on Bellamy Road.

12:27.375 --> 12:28.708
On the way home,

12:28.791 --> 12:32.291
they'll park in that lot at
the corner of 14th and 3rd,

12:32.375 --> 12:34.125
they'll cross that road

12:35.000 --> 12:37.083
and get Tom from
his swimming lesson.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.291
That's a nasty intersection.

12:45.375 --> 12:46.375
So...

12:46.583 --> 12:48.583
If you want to see
your exhusband

12:48.666 --> 12:49.875
and your daughter again,

12:49.958 --> 12:52.083
you'll bring that
fucking woman to me.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
It's me.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.166
I'm gonna kill him.

13:13.833 --> 13:15.000
Just like I promised.

13:17.666 --> 13:18.750
But I love her.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.500
That wasn't supposed
to happen, but...

13:26.208 --> 13:27.833
I need her to forgive me.

13:31.333 --> 13:32.666
I just don't know how.

13:38.083 --> 13:39.083
Are you there?

13:55.916 --> 13:56.916
Anna?

14:00.875 --> 14:02.000
Mrs. Worth!

14:02.083 --> 14:03.083
Is Anna with you?

14:03.458 --> 14:04.458
No.

14:08.041 --> 14:09.041
Do you know where she is?

14:10.625 --> 14:11.666
No. What's happened?

14:13.708 --> 14:14.708
She's gone.

14:15.375 --> 14:16.416
Shit.

14:19.041 --> 14:20.125
I can help you find her.

14:25.916 --> 14:27.125
Okay, thanks.

14:55.666 --> 14:56.583
Dad.

14:56.666 --> 14:57.708
Be right there, buddy.

15:00.625 --> 15:01.875
- Dad?
- Elizabeth.

15:02.333 --> 15:03.500
Are the kids okay?

15:03.583 --> 15:05.543
You know, they waited
all weekend for you to call.

15:05.583 --> 15:08.625
I need you to do
exactly what I say.

15:09.875 --> 15:10.875
What's wrong?

15:10.916 --> 15:12.625
Remember where
we spent Thanksgiving?

15:12.708 --> 15:13.750
What?

15:13.833 --> 15:16.083
- 2012 family reunion?
- Yeah.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.333
- Don't say where.
- What?

15:18.416 --> 15:19.708
Tom, stop that.

15:19.958 --> 15:21.666
Don't take the kids
to school tomorrow.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.625
Go straight to where
we're talking about.

15:24.708 --> 15:27.916
I have a job interview
tomorrow, so what is this?

15:28.000 --> 15:29.583
I can't say.

15:30.041 --> 15:31.666
You just have to trust me.

15:32.166 --> 15:33.351
And I'm gonna have
to call you back

15:33.375 --> 15:34.642
because your son
is flooding the toilet.

15:34.666 --> 15:35.666
Don't hang up on...

15:36.166 --> 15:37.333
Fuck!

17:16.333 --> 17:17.915
Did you check
the local cab company?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.165
And the buses.

17:19.958 --> 17:21.500
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

17:23.958 --> 17:24.958
Christ.

17:25.458 --> 17:26.726
She couldn't have been
stupid enough

17:26.750 --> 17:27.833
to hitchhike, could she?

17:27.915 --> 17:28.916
She's not stupid.

17:29.625 --> 17:30.625
No.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.750
So what's she playing at?

17:33.875 --> 17:34.875
She's upset.

17:39.250 --> 17:40.500
What happened between you two?

17:41.583 --> 17:42.416
Nothing.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.000
Having sex is not nothing.

17:45.291 --> 17:46.333
Not for Anna.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.458
It's not me she's upset with.

17:53.458 --> 17:54.583
It's her dad.

18:20.625 --> 18:21.791
Jesus.

18:27.833 --> 18:28.833
Don't worry.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.125
I took the turnoff.

18:33.208 --> 18:34.208
What?

18:34.666 --> 18:36.541
I took the turnoff
to Little Big Bear.

18:39.291 --> 18:42.500
But you said that Gagnon
would be waiting there for us.

18:43.541 --> 18:45.041
You said you wouldn't make it.

19:01.833 --> 19:02.833
Shit.

19:04.916 --> 19:06.416
Shit, shit, shit.

19:11.916 --> 19:13.125
Airport's the other way.

19:15.625 --> 19:16.625
You...

19:17.541 --> 19:19.000
You know,
my dad's Chief of Police.

19:22.208 --> 19:23.500
I wouldn't worry about Daddy.

19:24.166 --> 19:25.166
What?

19:25.583 --> 19:26.583
He's a wino, baby.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.083
Wherever he is,
he's probably juiced.

19:33.625 --> 19:35.208
You touch me,
my dad'll kill you.

19:35.291 --> 19:36.500
I doubt it.

19:43.708 --> 19:44.976
There's only one road
out of town,

19:45.000 --> 19:46.416
so she must be
somewhere up ahead.

19:49.333 --> 19:50.333
Yeah.

19:56.708 --> 19:57.791
I gotta know.

19:57.875 --> 19:59.625
Did you kill
the Police Chief's son?

20:00.750 --> 20:01.750
No.

20:03.125 --> 20:04.405
He was just a little boy, Frank.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.958
That was not me.
That was nothing I did.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.761
You told me you came here
to kill the Chief.

20:11.333 --> 20:13.125
Chief says the guys
who tried to kill him

20:13.208 --> 20:14.916
missed and killed his son.

20:15.875 --> 20:18.458
So, who shot
the little boy, Frank?

20:18.541 --> 20:20.125
That fucking kid
you hang around with?

20:20.916 --> 20:22.208
Now, you listen to me.

20:22.291 --> 20:24.458
You say nothing about that kid
to anyone. You got that?

20:26.166 --> 20:27.333
That kid is family.

20:28.416 --> 20:29.416
I owe him.

20:29.583 --> 20:30.791
Jesus, Frank. What is this?

20:31.791 --> 20:34.333
Love, it'll soon be over. Yeah?

20:35.041 --> 20:36.041
Trust me.

20:36.458 --> 20:37.708
You're not a killer, Frank.

20:39.166 --> 20:40.166
Well, maybe not.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.708
But I'll do what I have to.

21:14.500 --> 21:15.500
What now?

21:17.541 --> 21:18.541
Please.

21:19.625 --> 21:20.625
Pretty please?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
Hey!

21:22.333 --> 21:23.333
Dad!

21:26.083 --> 21:27.708
Mum?

21:28.500 --> 21:29.416
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

21:29.500 --> 21:30.333
What happened?

21:30.416 --> 21:32.416
Nothing. He just offered me
a lift. Can we just go?

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
What did he do to you?

21:34.875 --> 21:36.515
- Jesus, Anna, you're shaking.
- I'm fine.

21:36.958 --> 21:38.142
Do you want me
to take care of him?

21:38.166 --> 21:39.166
No.

21:43.291 --> 21:44.625
Jesus, Mum.

21:44.708 --> 21:45.833
- Stay here.
- What?

21:46.416 --> 21:47.416
You, stay with her.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.208
Hey!

21:51.875 --> 21:53.625
They're both fucking mad.

21:53.708 --> 21:55.541
- What did you do to my daughter?
- Nothing.

21:55.625 --> 21:57.083
- Did you touch her?
- No.

21:57.166 --> 21:58.916
- Liar.
- Fuck you, bitch.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.250
- Fuck me?
- Yeah.

22:00.333 --> 22:01.833
- Bitch?
- I never put a hand on...

22:03.833 --> 22:05.583
That fucking hurts.

22:09.708 --> 22:10.875
You repeat after me.

22:10.958 --> 22:11.958
I will never...

22:12.291 --> 22:13.291
Really?

22:14.916 --> 22:15.916
I will never...

22:16.208 --> 22:17.083
I will never...

22:17.166 --> 22:18.166
Go near...

22:18.208 --> 22:19.208
Go near...

22:19.291 --> 22:20.541
A teenage girl...

22:21.000 --> 22:22.041
A teenage girl...

22:22.125 --> 22:23.041
Maybe we should let him go.

22:23.125 --> 22:24.750
- Feck off.
- Feck off.

22:24.833 --> 22:25.833
Not you.

22:26.416 --> 22:27.416
Ever again.

22:27.916 --> 22:28.916
Say it.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.875
Ever... again.

22:34.958 --> 22:35.958
Good.

22:44.208 --> 22:45.208
Bitch.

22:53.875 --> 22:54.875
Get in.

23:05.083 --> 23:06.666
Here, stop right here.

23:06.958 --> 23:08.291
You sure this is a good idea?

23:11.125 --> 23:12.166
I'll be quick.

23:13.875 --> 23:14.875
Be right back.

23:30.750 --> 23:31.750
Yes.

23:33.541 --> 23:34.875
We're behind Randy's bar.

23:41.375 --> 23:42.541
Get out of the car

23:43.166 --> 23:44.291
and walk away.

24:06.458 --> 24:07.458
Let's go.

24:11.958 --> 24:13.166
Fuck.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
You know,

24:18.291 --> 24:20.000
I thought that I was
strong enough

24:21.750 --> 24:23.791
to manage without my kids.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.000
I could tough it out.

24:36.166 --> 24:40.625
You know, just make them proud.

24:45.791 --> 24:46.958
But it hurts.

25:07.125 --> 25:09.458
I'm sorry I flew off the handle.

25:09.541 --> 25:11.041
Go to the biggest mall
you can find,

25:11.125 --> 25:13.250
leave the car,
take a cab to the airport.

25:13.333 --> 25:15.958
Leave your laptops, your phone,
anything they can trace.

25:16.041 --> 25:19.083
Jesus Christ, Beth.
Is this real?

25:19.958 --> 25:21.198
Just tell me that you'll do it.

25:21.458 --> 25:22.500
Fuck.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.875
- Tell me that you will go.
- I'll go.

25:24.958 --> 25:27.208
I'll go.
How will you contact us?

25:27.958 --> 25:29.916
- I'll find a way.
- What's going on?

25:37.333 --> 25:38.458
Holy shit!

25:56.500 --> 25:57.750
- Anna.
- What?

25:57.833 --> 25:59.833
- Can we talk about this?
- About what?

26:00.166 --> 26:01.666
About you running away
from home.

26:01.750 --> 26:03.630
I ran away because my mum
and dad are murderers.

26:04.416 --> 26:05.250
What?

26:05.333 --> 26:06.684
I asked you why dad
was covered in blood,

26:06.708 --> 26:08.017
and the next thing
you're out in the woods

26:08.041 --> 26:09.250
burning his bloody clothes.

26:10.916 --> 26:12.351
Okay, can we talk
about this in private?

26:12.375 --> 26:13.695
No. I don't want
to talk about it.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.375
Anna.

26:40.708 --> 26:41.750
What a family.

26:42.791 --> 26:43.791
They're maniacs.

26:46.250 --> 26:47.250
They are.

26:54.875 --> 26:56.250
I'm sorry for being a cunt.

26:59.958 --> 27:00.958
Yeah, you were.

27:10.958 --> 27:12.375
What am I gonna do now?

27:12.458 --> 27:14.083
Yeah, you're pretty fucked.

27:26.750 --> 27:27.750
It's him, isn't it?

27:29.291 --> 27:30.500
I don't want to see him.

27:34.958 --> 27:35.958
Leave it to me.

27:58.125 --> 27:59.291
She doesn't want to see you.

28:05.666 --> 28:06.958
What's it like being you?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.375
What's it like

28:10.875 --> 28:13.125
waking up and not remembering

28:13.625 --> 28:15.291
who it is that you've hurt

28:16.333 --> 28:17.625
the night before?

28:18.458 --> 28:19.500
The week before?

28:20.833 --> 28:22.166
The year before?

28:23.333 --> 28:24.916
- You've got no remorse.
- Hand.

28:26.250 --> 28:29.333
You've got no remorse 'cause
you can't fucking remember

28:29.416 --> 28:30.517
what it was that you did wrong.

28:30.541 --> 28:32.291
Take your fucking hand off me.

28:32.375 --> 28:33.791
She can't live with that
no more.

28:34.416 --> 28:35.416
Anna,

28:36.541 --> 28:38.208
it's not safe for her.

28:38.291 --> 28:39.291
She's had enough.

28:40.083 --> 28:42.291
So, they'd be better off alone
than with a dad like you.

28:43.500 --> 28:44.500
Dad!

28:48.041 --> 28:49.416
Dad.

28:49.500 --> 28:50.500
Jack.

28:50.583 --> 28:52.291
Shit..

28:53.750 --> 28:55.041
- Anna.
- It was an accident.

28:55.416 --> 28:56.416
She's safer with me.

28:57.041 --> 28:59.166
Anna.

29:06.083 --> 29:07.083
Anna!

29:18.958 --> 29:20.333
- I go after her?
- No!

29:21.291 --> 29:22.531
Shit. It'll only make it worse.

29:23.833 --> 29:26.541
Jesus Christ, Jack,
I just got her back.

29:27.666 --> 29:28.750
Fucking shit.

29:31.125 --> 29:32.333
Damn you, Jack.

29:41.708 --> 29:43.708
Sure, it's my fault.
I gave you the fecking bottle.

29:48.333 --> 29:50.333
It's easier to deal with guns
and revenge

29:50.416 --> 29:52.791
than it is a wee
little dead boy.

29:59.125 --> 30:00.333
This has to stop.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.416
Promise me.

30:04.458 --> 30:05.458
No more, Jack.

31:00.708 --> 31:02.875
So how'd Gagnon know
we were gonna be there?

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Cameras?

31:12.833 --> 31:16.041
I still say that
we make a run for it.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.750
Get our asses to Calgary.

31:17.833 --> 31:19.166
I told you, we're low on gas,

31:19.250 --> 31:20.726
and I'm not going to
a service station

31:20.750 --> 31:22.083
in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

31:24.375 --> 31:25.833
Yeah, well,
what are we gonna do?

31:28.333 --> 31:29.583
I'm trying to fucking think.

32:21.750 --> 32:22.976
I need to talk to your husband.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
What about?

32:24.041 --> 32:25.041
We're being followed.

32:25.833 --> 32:26.833
I can explain.

32:28.041 --> 32:30.000
I know who this woman is.
I read the papers.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.916
This is my home.
Why would you bring her here?

32:33.500 --> 32:34.500
We need help.

32:35.958 --> 32:37.291
Why? What's wrong?

32:39.250 --> 32:40.083
Kill the lights.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.000
What?

32:41.083 --> 32:42.666
Quick.

33:49.041 --> 33:51.041
We should maybe be
calling the Federal Police?

33:52.833 --> 33:55.458
Gagnon buys cops.
That's why we're here.

33:56.166 --> 33:57.583
We need a cop we can trust,

33:57.666 --> 33:59.625
who's not afraid
to arrest a spook.

34:00.958 --> 34:01.958
For what?

34:05.000 --> 34:07.833
I saw Suzy Bouchard's murder.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.125
Suzy was my sponsor.

34:14.125 --> 34:16.208
I told her what Gagnon
had done in Reverie,

34:16.291 --> 34:17.583
and she went after him.

34:18.416 --> 34:20.083
I was crashed out
in her basement

34:20.166 --> 34:22.041
the night he tried
to scare her, and...

34:22.125 --> 34:23.375
she fought back.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.059
This place is full of cameras.

34:47.083 --> 34:48.563
Surely, he wouldn't
try anything here.

35:07.958 --> 35:09.166
Holy shit.

35:27.625 --> 35:28.625
Fuck.

35:31.500 --> 35:32.500
Stay here.

35:40.416 --> 35:41.416
Go get a knife.

35:41.625 --> 35:42.625
A knife?

35:42.708 --> 35:44.291
A fucking knife. Go get one.

37:25.333 --> 37:26.458
Shit.

38:20.250 --> 38:22.125
What's that?

38:26.250 --> 38:27.250
Put it down.

38:33.458 --> 38:34.875
That shit.

38:45.041 --> 38:46.958
You're a nasty woman.

39:35.125 --> 39:37.416
This is a step up
from the back of a truck.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.208
I found it the other day.

39:40.958 --> 39:42.166
You'll be safe here.

39:52.541 --> 39:54.583
You know, you've been
a complete prick.

39:58.166 --> 39:59.333
You treated me like shit.

40:04.416 --> 40:05.833
But you're the only one
I can trust.

40:12.083 --> 40:13.083
How much?

40:14.875 --> 40:15.875
What?

40:18.250 --> 40:20.125
How much do you trust me?

40:26.500 --> 40:27.791
With my life.

40:35.291 --> 40:36.458
Then maybe you're ready.

40:37.958 --> 40:39.000
For what?

40:46.166 --> 40:47.166
The truth.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Fuck!

41:39.458 --> 41:40.750
Fuck! Fuck!

41:42.416 --> 41:44.041
Fuck! Fuck!

42:10.625 --> 42:12.791
God! Fuck off!

42:25.458 --> 42:26.500
Pete, is that you?

42:28.791 --> 42:30.000
Honey?

42:37.875 --> 42:38.875
- Pete?
- Pete?

42:41.666 --> 42:42.541
Who the...

42:42.625 --> 42:44.083
- My God!
- Who the hell are you?

42:44.166 --> 42:45.916
I'm sorry. Sit down.

42:50.458 --> 42:51.458
Car keys.

42:51.500 --> 42:52.500
What?

42:52.958 --> 42:53.958
Car keys.

42:54.916 --> 42:56.500
Give me yourfucking car keys!

42:57.375 --> 42:58.375
Fucking now!

43:02.791 --> 43:03.791
Fuck's sake!

43:04.625 --> 43:05.875
Fuckin' hurt!

43:07.583 --> 43:08.666
Fuckin' twat!

43:26.666 --> 43:27.875
Fucking car.

43:40.458 --> 43:41.458
Where is he?

44:02.333 --> 44:04.541
Fuck!

44:14.083 --> 44:15.250
Who are you?

44:15.333 --> 44:16.500
It's payback, Jack.

44:18.583 --> 44:21.708
You kill me
and you'll never find out.
