01:37.367 --> 01:40.662
Deference to the executive
cannot possibly justify

01:40.745 --> 01:45.625
the injuries to Mr. Mahmoud
or the death of his family members.

01:45.709 --> 01:50.421
If you do not say that this is wrong,
that this is unconstitutional,

01:50.505 --> 01:55.301
there is nothing to prevent this sort
of senseless tragedy from happening again.

01:55.385 --> 01:58.804
We ask for nothing more
than reform and oversight.

01:58.888 --> 02:01.057
Your ruling is a crucial first step.

02:01.140 --> 02:03.226
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Katyal.

02:03.309 --> 02:04.728
Ms. Dunbar.

02:10.483 --> 02:13.403
Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the court,

02:13.486 --> 02:17.281
the security of American citizens
is the reason our drone program

02:17.365 --> 02:19.534
and other covert operations exist.

02:19.617 --> 02:22.912
But that security
often comes with a cost.

02:22.995 --> 02:26.499
At this very moment,
the president is at Arlington Cemetery,

02:26.583 --> 02:28.918
laying to rest three Navy SEALs

02:29.001 --> 02:32.797
who perished on a mountainside
in Afghanistan.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.383
They gave their lives to save others.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074

02:55.945 --> 02:58.531
And God said to Abraham,
"Take your son,

02:58.615 --> 03:02.285
your only son, whom you love,
Isaac, and sacrifice him."

03:03.536 --> 03:05.121
Abraham was willing.

03:06.539 --> 03:11.419
But when he raised his knife
above Isaac on the altar,

03:11.502 --> 03:13.170
God stopped him.

03:13.254 --> 03:17.174
For Abraham had proven
his devotion to God.

03:17.258 --> 03:22.138
Then God, to prove his devotion to us,

03:22.221 --> 03:24.641
made his own sacrifice.

03:24.724 --> 03:30.104
"For God so loved the world,
that he gave his only Son."

03:30.187 --> 03:34.442
Devotion. Sacrifice.

03:34.525 --> 03:35.777
Love.

03:35.860 --> 03:39.155
This is what the Lord teaches us.

03:39.238 --> 03:43.451
And what these young men
have exemplified.

03:43.534 --> 03:45.620
We shall forever honor them.

03:47.288 --> 03:51.501
And in heaven,
they will have eternal life.

03:52.794 --> 03:54.295
Amen.

03:54.378 --> 03:56.130
Ready, pull.

04:02.011 --> 04:04.930
As you are aware, we have
invoked the State secrets privilege

04:05.014 --> 04:07.016
during our request for dismissal.

04:07.099 --> 04:11.604
But I have authority from the president
to share some of the classified brief

04:11.688 --> 04:14.273
in order to reinforce
the government's argument.

04:15.692 --> 04:17.610
Are you certain you want to do that,
Ms. Dunbar?

04:17.694 --> 04:20.863
I am, Mr. Chief Justice.
And so is the president.

04:20.946 --> 04:24.367
So the government is publicly
admitting responsibility for the strike?

04:24.450 --> 04:25.785
It is, Your Honor.

04:25.869 --> 04:30.164
The terrorist successfully targeted
was Zuri Aziz.

04:30.247 --> 04:32.917
He routinely used civilians
as human shields.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.379
Mr. Mahmoud's family did not know
Aziz was in the same building.

04:36.462 --> 04:40.007
The drone strike is responsible
for their deaths.

04:40.090 --> 04:45.346
Mr. Mahmoud has suffered
a terrible injury and loss.

04:45.429 --> 04:49.975
While the government's action is tragic,
it wasn't unlawful.

04:50.059 --> 04:53.813
It was legal, it was necessary,
and it was right.

04:53.897 --> 04:56.273
Heather Dunbar?
She's never run for office.

04:56.357 --> 04:59.276
You don't become Solicitor General
without being politically savvy.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.445
It takes more than savvy
to be elected president.

05:01.529 --> 05:04.699
Don't forget, she has a national profile
after the Walker investigation.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.743
Truth and justice personified.

05:06.826 --> 05:09.036
If the leadership wants
to redefine the party, she's...

05:09.119 --> 05:11.997
No one with this little
experience has ever been a real contender

05:12.081 --> 05:14.250
since Ross Perot,
and at least he had the money.

05:14.333 --> 05:17.754
So does she.
Her family owns Dunbar Armored Cars.

05:19.714 --> 05:23.217
She could finance her entire campaign
if she needed to.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.344
But what prevents the abuse of power?

05:25.428 --> 05:28.681
The executive can't legislate,
can't receive appropriations,

05:28.765 --> 05:30.558
can't sentence people to imprisonment.

05:30.641 --> 05:32.560
All of these depend
on the other branches,

05:32.643 --> 05:34.771
which keeps executive power in check.

05:34.854 --> 05:37.022
But we know for a fact that,
in emergencies,

05:37.106 --> 05:39.525
the executive will contemplate actions

05:39.609 --> 05:42.278
that do not have clear
legislative authority

05:42.361 --> 05:45.949
and might be constitutionally dubious.

05:46.031 --> 05:48.117
Including...

05:57.334 --> 05:59.462
Are you asking about drone strikes,
Your Honor?

05:59.545 --> 06:01.338
Yes. Drone strikes.

06:01.422 --> 06:04.634
The fear of an out-of-control
executive is exaggerated.

06:04.717 --> 06:08.220
The president has strong electoral
and other political incentives

06:08.304 --> 06:09.889
to act in the public interest.

06:09.973 --> 06:13.058
You yourself have investigated
the White House for abuse of power.

06:13.142 --> 06:14.769
It forced a president to resign.

06:14.852 --> 06:18.648
Now you maintain that, uh, we should
give our president a wide berth?

06:18.731 --> 06:22.318
I am not here to defend any one person,

06:22.401 --> 06:25.696
but rather the office
of the presidency itself.

06:25.780 --> 06:29.533
We must hold everyone
in government accountable to the law.

06:29.617 --> 06:33.871
But we must not manufacture
our interpretation of the law

06:33.955 --> 06:37.500
to erode constitutional authority.

06:37.583 --> 06:42.630
We can prosecute presidents,
but not the presidency.

06:42.713 --> 06:44.214
We have to assume this is happening.

06:44.298 --> 06:46.175
We need to end her campaign
before it begins.

06:46.258 --> 06:48.344
She's clean.
Walker vetted her for Solicitor General,

06:48.427 --> 06:50.267
then again when he made her
special prosecutor.

06:50.304 --> 06:53.140
That's one of the things
that makes her so attractive.

06:53.223 --> 06:54.976
- Thank you, Jackie.
- Yes, sir.

06:57.478 --> 07:00.731
Well, if we can't knock her out,
we have to figure out another way.

07:17.456 --> 07:20.626
- It's something, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

07:22.503 --> 07:25.130
Traditionally,
the United States has not supported

07:25.214 --> 07:27.675
military action in the Middle East.

07:27.758 --> 07:30.970
But a neutral UN peacekeeping force
in the Jordan Valley

07:31.054 --> 07:36.266
is an essential first step
to sustainable, long-term peace.

07:36.350 --> 07:38.811
The United States will vote "yes."

07:38.895 --> 07:40.437
Thank you, Mr. President.

07:40.521 --> 07:42.523
I give the floor
to the representative

07:42.606 --> 07:44.400
of the Russian Federation.

07:45.985 --> 07:48.988
Russia is also committed
to stability in the region.

07:49.072 --> 07:52.658
But inserting the UN
into such a complicated situation

07:52.742 --> 07:55.828
could irrevocably damage
the hopes of real peace.

07:55.912 --> 07:59.331
I strongly encourage my colleagues
to not support this resolution.

07:59.415 --> 08:01.333
Thank you, Mr. President.

08:01.417 --> 08:06.005
With no further requests to speak,
I put the draft resolution to a vote.

08:06.089 --> 08:08.007
All those in favor?

08:10.009 --> 08:11.969
Those against?

08:14.097 --> 08:15.639
Those abstaining?

08:17.850 --> 08:23.188
The vote is 13 in favor,
one against, one abstention.

08:23.272 --> 08:25.232
The draft resolution does not pass

08:25.315 --> 08:30.320
due to the "no" vote by a permanent member
of the Security Council.

08:35.241 --> 08:38.287
We hoped that
Russia would change their mind

08:38.370 --> 08:40.164
but their veto doesn't surprise me.

08:40.246 --> 08:44.877
So we need your support
to bypass the Security Council.

08:44.961 --> 08:49.048
We don't want to
undermine the veto of permanent members.

08:49.132 --> 08:53.677
We will not establish
a dangerous precedent.

08:53.761 --> 08:58.057
The General Assembly can't override
the veto without a majority.

08:58.141 --> 09:00.392
Do you still have the support of Israel?

09:00.476 --> 09:03.813
I would not call you
if this was not the case.

09:03.896 --> 09:08.734
Then as long as Israel agrees, we agree.

09:08.818 --> 09:11.904
Wonderful. Thank you, Ambassador.

09:11.988 --> 09:17.201
I'll let you know when we decide
to submit it to a vote.

09:23.332 --> 09:25.626
Ileana, France is in.

09:25.709 --> 09:28.671
I need to be certain
Israel will stand firm.

09:36.095 --> 09:38.263
Israel will never maintain
its commitment.

09:38.347 --> 09:42.601
Israel wants what the rest of the world
wants, sustainable security.

09:42.685 --> 09:45.896
Trust me on this, I've dealt with
Jerusalem for many years at the UN.

09:45.980 --> 09:48.565
The moment it gets difficult,
they'll turn their back on you.

09:48.649 --> 09:51.401
- And it will get difficult.
- You're right.

09:51.485 --> 09:53.654
I can't predict how they will act
down the road,

09:53.737 --> 09:56.281
but I do know they will vote
for this resolution.

09:56.365 --> 09:57.992
We'll see.

09:58.075 --> 10:00.452
Going around the Security Council
is a radical move.

10:00.536 --> 10:03.080
It's not radical, it's justified.

10:03.164 --> 10:06.291
You dust off some 60-year-old
precedent and think you're justified?

10:06.375 --> 10:08.752
The Uniting for Peace resolution
was used to start a war.

10:08.836 --> 10:10.546
To end North Korea's aggression.

10:10.629 --> 10:12.840
Semantics.

10:12.923 --> 10:16.927
Ninety-three nations on board already,
including Israel, that's not semantics.

10:17.011 --> 10:19.555
Claire, I'm getting a lot of pressure
from the Kremlin.

10:19.638 --> 10:21.807
Petrov doesn't want this
to go to the General Assembly.

10:21.891 --> 10:24.309
Give me a little more time
to work on him.

10:34.862 --> 10:36.947
We've given you a month.
We're moving forward.

10:45.956 --> 10:48.125
- Yes?
- Ms. Dunbar is here.

10:48.209 --> 10:49.793
Send her in.

10:58.594 --> 11:00.804
- Heather.
- Mr. President.

11:00.888 --> 11:04.141
I listened to the audio of your defense
this morning. It was outstanding.

11:04.225 --> 11:06.727
You were right about making
the emotional argument.

11:06.810 --> 11:10.022
I think it will help the country heal.
Please, have a seat.

11:16.904 --> 11:20.032
I'm also going to meet later tonight
with Mr. Mahmoud privately.

11:20.116 --> 11:24.078
- To personally apologize.
- That's a compassionate thing to do.

11:26.622 --> 11:29.959
When I listened to your argument,
I also heard something else.

11:30.042 --> 11:34.421
There was a moment when Justice Jacobs
was asking you about drone strikes.

11:34.504 --> 11:36.006
Yeah, I remember.

11:36.090 --> 11:40.761
And he paused...
for quite a long time.

11:41.929 --> 11:44.765
I think...
he just lost his train of thought.

11:44.848 --> 11:46.892
Well...

11:50.604 --> 11:54.733
What I'm about to tell you
has to remain between us.

11:54.817 --> 11:57.111
Of course.

11:57.194 --> 12:00.156
Justice Jacobs has Alzheimer's.

12:00.239 --> 12:03.033
He came to me a few months ago
to tell me.

12:03.117 --> 12:05.995
Now, it's in the early stages,
so you wouldn't even notice

12:06.078 --> 12:08.164
unless you know what to look for.

12:08.247 --> 12:10.124
He wants to remain on the court?

12:10.207 --> 12:12.584
Well, that's what I want to discuss.

12:12.668 --> 12:14.461
He wanted to retire.

12:14.544 --> 12:17.047
I asked him to hold on
just a little while longer,

12:17.131 --> 12:20.759
until I could find a suitable
replacement and now I have.

12:20.843 --> 12:24.263
And I want that replacement...
to be you.

12:26.932 --> 12:28.767
What do you think?

12:31.061 --> 12:35.565
I'm... humbled, sir.

12:35.649 --> 12:39.778
And... honestly surprised
that you'd consider me.

12:39.862 --> 12:42.865
- Why is that?
- Given our history.

12:42.948 --> 12:45.742
When I said that was water
under the bridge, I meant it.

12:45.826 --> 12:47.995
You have the finest legal mind
in this country,

12:48.078 --> 12:50.206
a deep understanding
of the Constitution,

12:50.289 --> 12:52.791
and the Republicans wouldn't dare
block your nomination.

12:52.875 --> 12:55.752
After all, you prosecuted
a Democratic president.

12:55.836 --> 12:58.172
You're too good to be Solicitor General.

12:58.255 --> 13:02.467
Let's make sure you have a job for life.

13:02.551 --> 13:05.804
I appreciate you saying that, sir.

13:05.888 --> 13:08.015
I'm sorry.

13:08.098 --> 13:10.017
This is a lot to process.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.269
It's important we do this
before the election.

13:12.353 --> 13:14.397
We could end up
with a Republican president.

13:14.479 --> 13:17.149
And I don't want
to suggest your name to Jacobs

13:17.233 --> 13:19.235
unless you truly want the position.

13:19.318 --> 13:23.155
So... I need to know now.

13:25.991 --> 13:28.869
Yes. It would be a great honor.

13:28.952 --> 13:31.163
Good. Congratulations.

13:31.247 --> 13:33.332
You speak to your family.
I'll speak to Jacobs.

13:33.416 --> 13:35.251
Thank you, Mr. President.

14:15.499 --> 14:18.252
- Did you see this?
- Hm? See what?

14:18.335 --> 14:20.754
I just got an alert.

14:20.837 --> 14:23.507
I don't know.
I haven't, uh... seen Jim in a while.

14:26.176 --> 14:27.719
That's weird.

14:36.103 --> 14:38.814
I want to offer you my sincerest regret.

14:38.897 --> 14:42.151
And I hope that you
will accept my apology.

14:42.234 --> 14:44.069
I'm sorry, but I can't.

14:44.153 --> 14:46.822
I know it should have come sooner.

14:46.905 --> 14:48.865
There needs to be more oversight.

14:48.949 --> 14:50.510
Well, there is congressional oversight.

14:50.575 --> 14:53.578
We have a rigorous system
to prevent collateral damage.

14:53.662 --> 14:56.123
Civilians are listed as "other militants."

14:56.206 --> 14:59.584
But the government offers
no evidence that's true.

14:59.668 --> 15:02.379
It definitely wasn't in my case.

15:02.463 --> 15:05.132
How rigorous can your process be?

15:05.215 --> 15:09.928
The numbers of non-combatants
who are being killed by drone strikes

15:10.012 --> 15:12.973
- is lower than it's ever been.
- Those numbers are false.

15:13.056 --> 15:16.477
One civilian killed in 2010?
That has to be wrong.

15:16.560 --> 15:20.105
Look, I don't think the Pentagon
is being honest about...

15:22.649 --> 15:26.320
Are you okay?

15:27.737 --> 15:31.492
- I'll get the doctor up here.
- Don't do that. It'll pass.

15:33.035 --> 15:34.744
Phantom pain.

15:43.379 --> 15:46.131
You know what I dreamed of
when I came here?

15:46.215 --> 15:48.717
Choking you with my bare hands.

16:00.563 --> 16:03.399
Mr. Mahmoud, you may hate me.

16:03.482 --> 16:06.151
You may hate the office I hold.

16:06.235 --> 16:08.695
But here's the reality:

16:08.778 --> 16:13.783
I must make decisions every day
that I hope are just.

16:13.867 --> 16:17.079
I don't know right
from wrong all the time.

16:17.162 --> 16:18.955
I wish I did.

16:20.207 --> 16:23.168
But what I can't be is indecisive.

16:23.252 --> 16:28.215
It says in the Qur'an:
"The taking of one innocent life

16:28.298 --> 16:30.926
is like the taking of all mankind."

16:31.009 --> 16:36.473
It also says that
"the saving of one life

16:36.557 --> 16:39.351
is like the saving of all mankind."

16:42.938 --> 16:45.441
You didn't ask me here to apologize.

16:45.524 --> 16:48.068
You asked me here to forgive you.

16:50.362 --> 16:51.988
I didn't order the strike that...

16:53.115 --> 16:55.951
I won't forgive you, Mr. President.

16:56.034 --> 16:59.037
I don't want to make it any easier
for you to sleep at night.

16:59.121 --> 17:02.499
And knowing a few lines of the Qur'an
does not absolve you.

17:07.503 --> 17:10.757
I have a duty to this nation,
Mr. Mahmoud.

17:10.839 --> 17:12.050
I swore an oath.

17:12.134 --> 17:16.054
There's a fine line
between duty and murder.

17:18.056 --> 17:21.268
Only you have the power
to stop what happened to me.

17:21.351 --> 17:26.648
The next time you wield it...
I hope you'll think twice.

17:26.731 --> 17:29.693
Yes, of course. Meechum!

17:31.194 --> 17:33.530
- Yes, sir?
- You show Mr. Mahmoud out.

17:38.827 --> 17:41.538
Two months of random sampling
across the country.

17:41.622 --> 17:44.374
Less than a tenth of a percent
of all incoming data.

17:44.458 --> 17:45.459
Why so little?

17:45.542 --> 17:47.343
You have any idea
how many cameras we monitor?

17:47.419 --> 17:49.630
The CPU core quota
of every mainframe in Washington

17:49.713 --> 17:51.214
couldn't handle all that data.

17:51.298 --> 17:53.717
I tried doubling the sample range
and it set off alarms.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.052
I came this fucking close
to getting caught.

17:56.136 --> 17:58.847
Okay, we just need
to narrow the search, man.

17:58.930 --> 18:02.267
- It's too much ground to cover.
- How?

18:02.351 --> 18:06.021
I need more information on Rachel.

18:06.104 --> 18:08.398
Favorite books, fuckin' movies.

18:08.482 --> 18:10.775
- Anything.
- I don't know.

18:10.859 --> 18:12.739
Come on.
Did she ever talk about going anywhere?

18:12.819 --> 18:16.114
- Traveling to some place?
- No. Traveling wasn't an option.

18:17.115 --> 18:18.575
I need more, man.

18:20.827 --> 18:23.830
- What about the other girl? Lisa.
- I'm reading her e-mails.

18:23.913 --> 18:26.291
I'm tracking her phone.
There's nothing there.

18:28.084 --> 18:30.170
We should get close to her, though.
We should talk to her.

18:30.253 --> 18:32.172
- Extract something.
- She might recognize me.

18:32.255 --> 18:35.634
- I'll do it.
- That makes me nervous.

18:35.718 --> 18:37.678
It's social engineering.
I'll just hack her that way.

18:37.761 --> 18:39.513
She won't suspect a thing.

18:41.557 --> 18:45.227
If we don't try something new,
we're not gonna find Rachel.

18:50.232 --> 18:51.983
Help yourself
to some boiled peanuts.

18:52.067 --> 18:54.152
No, thank you. Too much salt.

18:54.236 --> 18:56.739
First week I was here,
I asked one of the stewards

18:56.821 --> 18:58.323
if I could have some boiled peanuts.

18:58.407 --> 19:00.992
I used to eat them all the time
as a kid, and I'll be damned

19:01.076 --> 19:03.953
if there hasn't been a full bowl
of peanuts here every day since.

19:04.037 --> 19:06.831
They must have a pot boiling
'round the clock.

19:06.915 --> 19:09.084
Ruth has me eating kale crisps now.

19:09.167 --> 19:12.170
Says they're good for me.
I can't stand the things.

19:12.254 --> 19:13.714
I have them shucked in the kitchen,

19:13.797 --> 19:17.842
so you don't even have to get your
fingers dirty. Feel free. Live a little.

19:22.097 --> 19:26.769
Mr. Justice, since we last spoke,
I've done a lot of soul searching.

19:26.851 --> 19:30.021
It was unfair of me
to ask you to stay on the bench.

19:30.105 --> 19:33.734
If you want to retire, you should.

19:33.817 --> 19:36.486
I appreciate your consideration,
Mr. President.

19:36.570 --> 19:40.240
Well, I thought the first thing I should
do is to find a suitable successor.

19:40.323 --> 19:43.368
Someone you would approve of
to put your mind at ease,

19:43.452 --> 19:45.704
- and I think I've found one.
- Who?

19:45.788 --> 19:50.667
- Heather Dunbar.
- I think she'd be an excellent justice.

19:50.751 --> 19:52.252
I'm glad you agree.

19:52.335 --> 19:56.298
Just an unlikely choice,
given how vociferous she...

19:56.381 --> 19:57.882
With the Walker investigation, yes.

19:57.966 --> 20:00.093
But that only increases
my estimation of her.

20:00.176 --> 20:02.220
She has a great sense of duty.

20:02.304 --> 20:05.599
More than any Solicitor General
I've ever worked with.

20:05.682 --> 20:09.561
I wish I'd known the reason
you invited me beforehand.

20:09.645 --> 20:12.439
- I could have saved you the trouble.
- Why?

20:12.522 --> 20:14.733
After I talked to you
a couple of months ago,

20:14.817 --> 20:17.152
Ruth said you'd given me a gift.

20:17.235 --> 20:20.155
That I would be miserable
if I weren't on the bench.

20:20.238 --> 20:23.908
She talked to my sons
and they all agreed.

20:23.992 --> 20:25.869
As long as I'm well enough
to serve the court,

20:25.952 --> 20:30.165
that's where I want to be.
And we'll keep an eye on 2016.

20:30.248 --> 20:34.878
If it looks as though the Republicans
will win, I'll step down.

20:34.961 --> 20:38.173
If not, I'll stay.
But, there's no rush.

20:43.637 --> 20:45.597
Must I destroy this man?

20:45.681 --> 20:47.516
Mr. President?

20:52.020 --> 20:55.398
No. I won't.

20:55.482 --> 20:57.567
Excuse me?

20:59.695 --> 21:05.492
I won't stand by
and watch you make this mistake.

21:07.494 --> 21:09.496
I've thought this through.

21:10.873 --> 21:14.877
We're not friends, Robert.
We don't know each other that well.

21:14.959 --> 21:17.045
But I care about you.

21:17.128 --> 21:20.131
Because you served
for more than 20 years on the bench.

21:20.215 --> 21:23.593
You've established legal precedents
that will outlive both of us.

21:23.677 --> 21:27.430
And... maybe you can explain away
yesterday as a senior moment.

21:27.514 --> 21:30.809
But what if another moment happens
that you can't explain away?

21:30.893 --> 21:34.020
What if somehow the news
of your illness leaks?

21:34.103 --> 21:37.482
Then every decision you've written
will be called into question.

21:37.566 --> 21:39.025
They'll be challenged.

21:39.108 --> 21:42.404
And a life's work will be undone
in a heartbeat.

21:42.487 --> 21:45.281
Do you have some ulterior motive here?

21:45.365 --> 21:47.617
Only your best interests.

21:47.701 --> 21:49.327
But why the urgency?

21:52.497 --> 21:55.375
I want to protect you.

21:55.458 --> 21:59.504
Justice, I'm asking you,
I'm pleading with you.

21:59.588 --> 22:04.259
Don't let events get out of your control.

22:04.342 --> 22:06.010
Will you reconsider?

22:08.137 --> 22:11.391
I appreciate your concern, Mr. President.

22:11.474 --> 22:14.644
Let me speak again to Ruth
and I'll get back to you.

22:15.687 --> 22:17.397
Thank you, Justice.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.816
- It's a moratorium.
- We're not calling it that.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.860
Call it whatever you want,
nobody's talking.

22:21.944 --> 22:23.904
We're trying to prevent misinformation.

22:23.987 --> 22:25.697
I'm supposed to write about AmWorks.

22:25.781 --> 22:28.784
How can I do that when no one from
the executive branch will speak to me?

22:28.867 --> 22:30.869
This thing's shifting
under our feet in Congress.

22:30.953 --> 22:33.455
By the time I finish the morning brief,
it's already outdated.

22:33.538 --> 22:36.249
I'm not asking for a one-on-one
with the president, but...

22:36.332 --> 22:39.335
the Secretary of Labor, Treasury,
one of his economic advisors.

22:39.419 --> 22:41.588
Give you special treatment?

22:41.671 --> 22:44.382
I think you issued the moratorium
because you're losing the battle.

22:44.466 --> 22:46.092
It's 500 billion dollars.

22:46.175 --> 22:48.386
This is the largest jobs program
since the New Deal.

22:48.470 --> 22:51.222
Of course it's a slugfest.
That doesn't mean we're losing.

22:51.306 --> 22:53.642
Then let me speak to someone
who can confirm that.

22:53.725 --> 22:56.185
Because all I'm hearing
from the Republicans is that

22:56.269 --> 22:57.854
AmWorks will never
see the light of day.

22:57.938 --> 23:00.774
I sympathize with you, Ayla.
I wish I could give you what you want.

23:02.734 --> 23:05.445
- The president needs us.
- So we'll talk later.

23:07.030 --> 23:09.699
Michael Corrigan,
the activist who organized the protest

23:09.783 --> 23:11.242
at the state dinner last month,

23:11.326 --> 23:13.829
arrested by Russian police
three hours ago in Moscow.

23:13.912 --> 23:15.497
The video is going viral.

23:15.580 --> 23:20.794
He's a high profile gay rights activist,
nationally and abroad.

23:20.877 --> 23:24.213
And he's been very vocal in Russia
over the last six weeks.

23:24.297 --> 23:26.257
Here's the bureau file on him, sir.

23:26.341 --> 23:27.926
Have we been in touch with the Kremlin?

23:28.010 --> 23:30.345
Secretary Durant
is in Tangier right now.

23:30.428 --> 23:33.306
I briefed her by phone
and she reached out to Bugayev.

23:33.389 --> 23:35.224
But they have not connected yet.

23:35.308 --> 23:38.770
Ambassador Grimes is making calls
in Moscow, but nobody's engaging,

23:38.854 --> 23:41.439
other than to say they plan
on fully prosecuting him.

23:41.523 --> 23:44.150
Ambassador, do you think
this could be in retaliation

23:44.233 --> 23:45.652
for what you're doing at the UN?

23:45.735 --> 23:47.153
It could be.

23:47.236 --> 23:50.114
The Russians are very upset
about this resolution.

23:50.198 --> 23:51.878
I'll see what I can find out
from Moryakov.

23:51.950 --> 23:54.661
Let's hold off on the press conference
until tomorrow.

23:54.744 --> 23:57.205
I'd like to deliver some good news
instead of no news.

23:57.288 --> 24:00.583
In the meantime, put out a statement
that we're in communication with Moscow.

24:00.667 --> 24:02.794
And that we're doing
everything we can to get Mr. Corrigan

24:02.878 --> 24:04.671
back to the United States.
Thank you all.

24:06.381 --> 24:09.801
Personally, I hate the law.
It's medieval homophobic nonsense.

24:09.885 --> 24:12.178
- But it's the law.
- I don't think it's coincidence

24:12.261 --> 24:14.347
that Corrigan was arrested
after our conversation.

24:14.430 --> 24:16.431
Well, I wouldn't think
it was a coincidence either.

24:16.432 --> 24:18.226
So what do you hope to achieve?

24:18.309 --> 24:20.520
The same thing as you do:
Mr. Corrigan's release.

24:20.603 --> 24:21.980
If I withdraw the resolution.

24:22.064 --> 24:24.858
I think Moscow would certainly see it
as a sign of goodwill.

24:24.941 --> 24:28.653
Well, we don't barter goodwill
for the freedom of American citizens.

24:28.737 --> 24:31.823
I actually advocated
for his immediate deportation.

24:31.907 --> 24:34.027
I agree that tossing him
in jail is counterproductive,

24:34.076 --> 24:35.952
but my superiors are adamant.

24:36.036 --> 24:38.830
Save Petrov from himself.

24:38.914 --> 24:42.876
It's not my place to question him.
Unlike you, I'm not married to my boss.

24:46.046 --> 24:49.424
I'll relay the Kremlin's position
to the president.

24:52.802 --> 24:55.263
If we give in,
the Jordan Valley plan is over

24:55.346 --> 24:58.058
and we show the Russians
we can be blackmailed.

24:58.141 --> 25:00.226
So we're just supposed
to let Corrigan rot away?

25:00.309 --> 25:03.855
I think if we continue to drive hard
at the UN, we'll gain leverage.

25:03.939 --> 25:05.982
- What does Cathy think?
- She agrees.

25:06.066 --> 25:08.985
I'm gonna take flak every day
that Corrigan remains in jail.

25:09.069 --> 25:10.820
And you'll take more if you back down.

25:10.904 --> 25:12.697
But it does mean I have
to get in front of the press

25:12.781 --> 25:14.699
with absolutely nothing
of substance to say.

25:14.783 --> 25:16.993
You spent 20 years in Congress.
You're good at that.

25:19.829 --> 25:21.456
It's good to hear you laugh.

25:22.540 --> 25:24.584
Get some sleep.
I'll call you tomorrow.

25:24.667 --> 25:26.044
Good night.

25:28.922 --> 25:31.716
Who specifically is communicating
between Washington and Moscow?

25:31.800 --> 25:34.260
All of our communication
is between the State Department

25:34.343 --> 25:35.904
and the Russian Foreign Ministry. Ayla.

25:35.971 --> 25:39.348
In your statement, you persisted
in calling this a free speech issue,

25:39.432 --> 25:41.309
but isn't gay rights really
at the center of this?

25:41.392 --> 25:44.062
Well, Mr. Corrigan was arrested
for speaking his mind.

25:44.146 --> 25:46.856
- No matter what his opinions...
- Aren't you skirting that,

25:46.940 --> 25:50.110
Mr. President, because your stance
on gay rights is unclear?

25:51.820 --> 25:54.948
What is clear is that Mr. Corrigan's
detainment is unjust

25:55.031 --> 25:56.866
and, as I said, we're doing
everything we can

25:56.950 --> 25:58.870
to make sure that he can come home.
Yes, Zachary.

25:58.952 --> 26:01.704
Following up. Isn't dodging
gay rights a calculated move

26:01.788 --> 26:04.499
for a man not running for office?

26:04.582 --> 26:06.626
You think I'm dodging?

26:06.709 --> 26:09.087
Well, then let me be
as clear as I possibly can be.

26:09.171 --> 26:11.131
Gay people have rights.

26:11.214 --> 26:13.883
And this administration has
always believed that Mr. Corrigan

26:13.967 --> 26:17.929
has the right to speak his mind without
fear of being arrested on any issue,

26:18.013 --> 26:19.889
whether it's gay rights
or something else.

26:19.973 --> 26:24.102
And what is also quite clear is that
you must have failed etiquette class.

26:24.186 --> 26:28.272
Why won't you speak to John Pasternak,
Michael Corrigan's husband?

26:28.356 --> 26:30.608
Mr. Pasternak has been trying
to contact the White House

26:30.692 --> 26:33.111
- and no one will speak with him.
- I do apologize, I have a meeting.

26:33.195 --> 26:35.822
I wish I could've gotten to all your
questions. Any further inquiries,

26:35.905 --> 26:38.658
please direct them to Mr. Grayson.
Thank you very much.

26:38.741 --> 26:40.160
I apologize, sir.

26:43.371 --> 26:45.165
- You went too far.
- I did my job.

26:45.248 --> 26:48.001
There's protocol.
There's basic decorum.

26:48.084 --> 26:50.628
How about this: you lift
the moratorium for me on AmWorks,

26:50.712 --> 26:53.589
I disappear for five weeks.
Focus on my long-lead piece.

26:53.673 --> 26:55.274
I don't touch Corrigan or anything else.

26:55.299 --> 26:56.759
You wanted me to chew you out.

26:56.843 --> 26:58.761
If that's what it takes
to get us talking.

26:58.845 --> 27:01.181
Which is why I need your credential.

27:02.182 --> 27:04.059
- What?
- Your credential.

27:05.227 --> 27:08.230
- You're kidding.
- Do you see me laughing?

27:08.312 --> 27:11.440
You don't control my credential.
The Correspondents' Association does.

27:11.524 --> 27:14.194
And I just spoke to Joel Weinmann.

27:14.277 --> 27:17.488
- He wouldn't.
- You succeeded, Ayla.

27:17.572 --> 27:20.992
I'm lifting the moratorium for every
other member of the press corps.

27:21.076 --> 27:23.369
The price was your credential.

27:24.579 --> 27:28.332
- He has no grounds.
- You disrespected the president,

27:28.416 --> 27:31.878
the office, and most importantly,
your fellow colleagues.

27:31.961 --> 27:34.422
- It wasn't a tough sell.
- Then this becomes my next story.

27:34.505 --> 27:37.341
Punishing a member of the press.
Collusion. Pay for play.

27:37.425 --> 27:39.052
And I'll deny.

27:39.135 --> 27:42.430
And do you think the head of the
association is gonna admit anything?

27:42.513 --> 27:46.184
You don't have any friends, Ayla,
on either side of the fence.

27:46.268 --> 27:48.394
The president just made a statement
about free speech.

27:48.477 --> 27:51.022
Now you're gonna start kicking
reporters out of the White House?

27:51.106 --> 27:54.442
- No. Just you.
- No, not just me!

27:54.525 --> 27:56.861
You're fucking with
the second largest daily in America.

27:56.945 --> 28:00.156
You can get rid of me, but you can't
get rid of the institution I work for.

28:01.741 --> 28:04.119
You done?

28:04.202 --> 28:07.163
Don't let your 15 minutes
of power go to your head, Seth.

28:08.831 --> 28:12.961
You can keep the plastic if you want...
as a souvenir.

28:13.044 --> 28:15.297
That's all it's good for, now.

28:24.806 --> 28:26.682
Hello?

28:26.766 --> 28:28.017
Yeah.

28:31.896 --> 28:33.439
Are you serious?

28:37.610 --> 28:39.612
Okay.

28:39.695 --> 28:40.822
Fuck.

28:44.492 --> 28:46.161
I need to speak to the president.

28:47.787 --> 28:52.500
Through our laws,
we seek to create a more perfect union.

28:52.583 --> 28:55.003
Government officials who abuse the law,

28:55.086 --> 29:00.424
or, at the very least, exploit the edges
of it for their own personal gain,

29:00.508 --> 29:05.221
tarnish our democracy and weaken
the bonds of our great nation.

29:05.305 --> 29:08.308
The Democratic Party
must step out of the shadow

29:08.391 --> 29:10.601
of scandal and redefine itself.

29:10.685 --> 29:12.979
I want her here
when she's done with this stunt.

29:13.062 --> 29:17.900
Embracing a new era of transparency,
honesty and justice,

29:17.984 --> 29:21.988
this country deserves a president
who has dedicated herself

29:22.071 --> 29:24.282
to those ideals in this court

29:24.366 --> 29:29.162
and many others, who has spent
her entire life defending the law,

29:29.245 --> 29:33.291
and who now wants to dedicate herself
to enforcing it.

29:33.375 --> 29:36.878
Let's restore integrity
to the Oval Office.

29:36.961 --> 29:41.632
Use its power to root out corruption
and lead by example.

29:41.716 --> 29:45.511
Today, before my family and friends,

29:45.594 --> 29:48.890
my God, and the highest court
in our land,

29:48.973 --> 29:54.729
I announce my candidacy for President
of the United States of America.

29:54.812 --> 29:58.316
There was no indication
Ms. Dunbar had plans to run for president.

29:58.400 --> 30:02.153
This will make her the second Solicitor
General in history to run for president,

30:02.237 --> 30:05.240
the only other being
William Howard Taft in 1908.

30:05.323 --> 30:07.409
With President Underwood
declaring he will not...

30:09.618 --> 30:11.746
- Mr. President.
- Ms. Dunbar.

30:13.122 --> 30:14.999
Please, take a seat.

30:16.376 --> 30:18.669
- My letter of resignation.
- I can't accept that.

30:18.753 --> 30:20.255
You're too valuable to us.

30:20.338 --> 30:22.548
I can't run for office
as Solicitor General.

30:22.631 --> 30:24.432
Then you should reconsider
running for office.

30:24.467 --> 30:26.052
It's too late for that, I think.

30:26.135 --> 30:27.303
I don't understand, Heather.

30:27.387 --> 30:30.306
I offered you a seat
on the Supreme Court.

30:30.390 --> 30:32.392
If Jacobs was stepping down,
which he isn't.

30:33.684 --> 30:34.894
You spoke to him.

30:34.977 --> 30:37.605
As Solicitor General,
I'm friendly with all the justices.

30:37.688 --> 30:41.817
I keep those relationships private
so no one will suspect any bias toward me.

30:41.901 --> 30:44.528
But Robert and I are very close.

30:44.612 --> 30:47.282
He and Ruth have me over
for dinner once a month.

30:47.365 --> 30:49.492
So you already knew
about the Alzheimer's?

30:49.575 --> 30:51.160
He told me the day he was diagnosed.

30:51.244 --> 30:54.038
I've never had anything
but his best interests at heart.

30:54.122 --> 30:56.458
You don't care about Robert.

30:56.540 --> 30:58.460
You wanted to sideline me.

30:58.542 --> 31:03.256
So you actually think
you have a shot at this office?

31:03.339 --> 31:06.092
Yes, I do.
And so does the leadership.

31:06.175 --> 31:08.219
You're in over your head, Heather,

31:08.303 --> 31:10.513
no matter what Birch
and Womack are telling you.

31:10.596 --> 31:13.349
Why should it concern you,
Mr. President?

31:13.433 --> 31:15.310
You've announced
that you're not running.

31:15.393 --> 31:19.397
- Is this personal for you?
- Don't flatter yourself.

31:19.481 --> 31:21.649
You got Walker, but you couldn't get me.

31:21.732 --> 31:24.692
I don't have to run to make sure you
leave office. You couldn't win anyway.

31:24.693 --> 31:27.363
I'm running because I know
I'd make a good president.

31:27.447 --> 31:30.241
You might very well
make a good president.

31:30.325 --> 31:32.618
But right now, you're being delusional.

31:32.701 --> 31:35.830
When Birch approached me, I wasn't sure.

31:35.913 --> 31:38.749
I was tempted,
but I knew it was a long shot.

31:38.833 --> 31:41.669
And when you offered the nomination,
I was overwhelmed.

31:41.752 --> 31:43.796
It's what I'd been working toward
my entire career.

31:43.879 --> 31:45.548
But then I spoke to Robert.

31:45.631 --> 31:49.093
And when he told me how you
threatened him, I knew I had to run.

31:49.177 --> 31:52.180
Someone needs to scrub the stink
from this office.

31:52.263 --> 31:54.849
- I didn't threaten him.
- What would you call it?

31:54.932 --> 31:56.267
I was trying to save him,

31:56.351 --> 31:58.394
in the same way I'm trying
to save you now.

31:58.478 --> 32:01.605
Once the news of his Alzheimer's
gets out, which it will,

32:01.689 --> 32:04.567
because no matter how much we all
try to lie about it, it's gonna leak,

32:04.650 --> 32:08.112
can you imagine what
that's going to do to his reputation?

32:08.196 --> 32:09.447
He deserves better than that.

32:09.531 --> 32:11.907
And you deserve better
than being an also-ran.

32:11.991 --> 32:14.369
Help me convince him.

32:14.452 --> 32:18.164
Take the seat on the court
where you belong.

32:18.247 --> 32:21.501
Is this how you live with yourself?

32:21.584 --> 32:25.421
By rationalizing the obscene
into the palatable?

32:30.301 --> 32:32.094
I haven't excused you yet.

32:32.178 --> 32:33.596
See you in Iowa.

32:57.870 --> 33:02.833
I wouldn't have made it through
the past eight months without my faith.

33:04.085 --> 33:07.088
But I wouldn't have made it
without this community, either.

33:08.339 --> 33:11.008
And on tough days...

33:11.092 --> 33:13.428
I remind myself of that.

33:13.511 --> 33:16.264
That I'm not alone.

33:16.347 --> 33:19.683
That I have all of you.

33:19.767 --> 33:23.896
And I think it's important
to acknowledge that.

33:23.979 --> 33:26.190
To give thanks.

33:26.274 --> 33:28.401
So thank you.

33:28.484 --> 33:30.278
All of you.

33:30.361 --> 33:34.365
For always being there.
For always being here.

33:39.370 --> 33:41.914
I have to go.
I'll see you soon.

33:47.253 --> 33:50.005
Hey.
I just wanted to say, what you said...

33:50.089 --> 33:51.840
it really connected with me.

33:51.924 --> 33:53.301
- About community.
- Thank you.

33:53.384 --> 33:54.594
- Yeah.
- I'm glad.

33:54.677 --> 33:57.138
- I'm Lisa. Hi.
- Of course. Max. Hi.

33:57.221 --> 33:59.307
- You're new.
- It was my first time, actually.

33:59.390 --> 34:02.893
- Do you live around here?
- Towson. Just drove up.

34:02.977 --> 34:04.604
How did you find out about us?

34:04.687 --> 34:08.857
Online. Website.

34:08.940 --> 34:13.571
Yeah, I was surfing around, and I was...
I was looking for something and...

34:13.655 --> 34:15.614
- It's stupid.
- No. No, no.

34:15.697 --> 34:18.784
- Tell me.
- Um...

34:19.577 --> 34:22.621
Okay, well, a few months ago, this girl...

34:22.705 --> 34:24.790
Um...

34:24.873 --> 34:28.293
The love of my life, actually...

34:28.377 --> 34:31.130
- Breakup?
- She just left me.

34:32.255 --> 34:33.507
Out of the blue.

34:33.591 --> 34:38.887
You know, one day she just said
it was over and that was it.

34:38.971 --> 34:42.808
Yeah. That's hard.

34:44.518 --> 34:47.271
I went through something similar
not that long ago.

34:47.355 --> 34:48.856
Oh, really?

34:48.938 --> 34:53.110
Sort of what I was talking about tonight
with the hard time I had been through.

34:53.194 --> 34:55.112
What happened?

34:56.237 --> 34:57.406
Oh...

34:57.490 --> 34:59.492
Ancient history.

34:59.575 --> 35:01.076
A guy left you?

35:02.370 --> 35:05.998
- It was a woman.
- Oh.

35:08.668 --> 35:12.588
I guess I'm not completely over it,
but time heals, you know?

35:12.672 --> 35:14.089
Mm-hmm.

35:14.173 --> 35:16.842
I gotta get home,
but it was nice to meet you, Max.

35:16.925 --> 35:18.844
Nice meeting you, Lisa.

35:27.478 --> 35:29.355
Can we reschedule?
Let me see.

35:29.438 --> 35:32.775
Yeah, yeah.
Can you move that up by a half an hour?

35:34.818 --> 35:37.572
- Hello?
- Is this a good time, Ms. Dunbar?

35:37.655 --> 35:40.074
- Who is this?
- Doug Stamper.

35:41.992 --> 35:44.078
How did you get this number?

35:44.161 --> 35:46.372
Phone numbers are easy.
What you should be asking

35:46.455 --> 35:49.250
is how I knew you were meeting
with Senator Giallo tonight.

35:50.585 --> 35:52.336
Look down the hallway.

35:55.673 --> 35:57.883
- Go ahead. I'll meet you down there.
- All right.

36:00.678 --> 36:04.390
No. Stay where you are.
We wouldn't want to be seen together.

36:06.141 --> 36:08.770
Did the president send you?

36:08.852 --> 36:12.273
No. He and I aren't in touch.

36:12.356 --> 36:14.149
Then why are you here?

36:14.233 --> 36:17.152
You're forming your team.
I want to be a part of it.

36:17.236 --> 36:19.822
- The real reason.
- That is the reason.

36:19.905 --> 36:23.075
He sent you. Don't lie to me.

36:25.620 --> 36:28.497
I've been out of the game
for nine months, Ms. Dunbar.

36:28.581 --> 36:30.124
I want to get back in.

36:30.207 --> 36:31.709
You're forming your team,

36:31.793 --> 36:33.586
and I want to get in
on the ground floor.

36:35.463 --> 36:38.006
The leadership isn't enough.

36:40.259 --> 36:42.094
You need the rank and file.

36:42.177 --> 36:45.013
Their connections to county
and municipal power brokers.

36:45.097 --> 36:47.266
The chiefs of a thousand kingdoms

36:47.349 --> 36:49.893
in every primary
from Iowa to Super Tuesday.

36:49.977 --> 36:52.772
I worked in the whip's office
for ten years.

36:52.855 --> 36:55.983
I have files on every single member.

36:56.066 --> 36:59.403
What they want, who they sleep with,
what they eat for lunch.

36:59.487 --> 37:01.947
I can be valuable to you.

37:02.030 --> 37:04.950
How did you know I was meeting
with Giallo tonight?

37:05.033 --> 37:07.119
You rub shoulders with the leadership.

37:07.202 --> 37:09.371
I rub shoulders with the people
who work for them.

37:15.670 --> 37:18.506
Think about it, Ms. Dunbar.
That's all I ask.

37:18.589 --> 37:19.923
Going down.

37:26.013 --> 37:28.015
I made a mistake.

37:28.098 --> 37:30.434
I mean, the way she spoke
to me in the Oval,

37:30.518 --> 37:33.270
I wanted to strangle her.

37:33.354 --> 37:35.147
I mean, what is she thinking?

37:35.230 --> 37:38.984
Running against an incumbent when
I offered her a seat on the court...

37:39.067 --> 37:41.612
She was going to run the moment
Birch whispered in her ear.

37:41.696 --> 37:44.824
Once people imagine themselves
in the Oval, there's no turning back.

37:44.907 --> 37:46.283
You know that as well as anybody.

37:46.367 --> 37:49.745
It's my own damn fault.
Shouldn't have given Jacobs the choice.

37:49.829 --> 37:52.540
I should've just announced her
nomination before I even asked her.

37:52.623 --> 37:54.500
- Should I come home?
- No.

37:55.626 --> 37:58.003
I just need to think.
I need to clear my head.

37:58.086 --> 38:00.297
Tell me what I can do.

38:03.676 --> 38:05.720
Why did I hold back?

38:06.721 --> 38:09.139
Why did I show Jacobs any mercy?

38:09.223 --> 38:12.100
Francis, this doesn't sound like you.

38:12.184 --> 38:14.687
Put this behind you.
Think about what's next.

38:17.064 --> 38:19.358
It was because of Mahmoud.

38:20.902 --> 38:23.571
I let him get to me.

38:24.739 --> 38:29.076
And all those flags on those coffins
and those soldiers, whose...

38:29.159 --> 38:32.162
I deployed and then
I buried in the ground. It's my...

38:32.246 --> 38:34.916
Stop it. This isn't doing you any good.

38:34.998 --> 38:37.418
I will talk about this
with you if you want,

38:37.501 --> 38:39.712
but if you're doubting yourself,
I can't indulge that.

38:39.795 --> 38:42.089
No, you're right, of course.

38:42.172 --> 38:43.758
Well, let's talk in the morning.

38:43.841 --> 38:46.552
- I'm here if you need me.
- I know.

38:47.762 --> 38:50.514
- Good night.
- Good night, Francis.

39:14.830 --> 39:18.542
Yes, can you reach out
to Bishop Eddis for me?

39:18.626 --> 39:20.043
I'll hold.

39:40.731 --> 39:42.274
Thank you, Meechum.

39:42.357 --> 39:44.610
- If we can have some privacy.
- Yes, sir.

39:47.029 --> 39:48.948
Still riding the Bonneville?

39:49.031 --> 39:52.534
Sold the '67 for a Pipeburn.
Beautiful bike.

39:52.618 --> 39:54.787
You should take me for a spin sometime.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.705
I don't think so.

39:56.789 --> 39:58.666
They're a death wish.

39:58.749 --> 40:01.418
At least you know
you have a place in heaven.

40:05.756 --> 40:08.300
What's on your mind, Mr. President?

40:08.383 --> 40:10.761
The burial the other day.

40:10.845 --> 40:15.599
You talked about Abraham and Isaac.
God giving up his only Son.

40:15.683 --> 40:19.895
Between you and me, that's the same
sermon I always use at Arlington.

40:19.979 --> 40:23.357
You put enough soldiers in the ground,
you get tired of writing new ones.

40:25.275 --> 40:28.236
- It was the first time I had heard it.
- Won't be the last.

40:30.238 --> 40:32.783
I want to understand what justice is.

40:32.867 --> 40:36.244
That's a big one.

40:36.328 --> 40:37.872
I know.

40:39.790 --> 40:43.377
There's our justice,
the kind men create.

40:43.460 --> 40:47.589
We base it on things
like the Ten Commandments.

40:47.673 --> 40:51.093
But those can be read
a million different ways.

40:51.176 --> 40:54.179
"Thou shalt not kill"
seems pretty clear.

40:54.262 --> 40:57.683
Who's to say? If we didn't kill,

40:57.766 --> 41:00.602
others would kill instead of us.

41:00.686 --> 41:03.271
There's a lot of killing in the Bible.

41:03.355 --> 41:04.815
King David was a warrior.

41:04.899 --> 41:09.528
How do you reconcile that
with the laws that God gave Moses?

41:09.611 --> 41:12.489
Even those laws require interpretation.

41:13.741 --> 41:16.785
There are two laws we have to remember
above all else.

41:18.662 --> 41:21.999
He tells us to love God

41:22.083 --> 41:23.751
and to love each other.

41:25.669 --> 41:29.131
You can't love the people you kill.

41:29.214 --> 41:30.758
You sure as hell can.

41:30.841 --> 41:34.136
And you have to love the people
who are trying to kill you.

41:35.387 --> 41:37.806
Jesus loved the Romans.

41:37.890 --> 41:42.061
"Father, forgive them," he said,
"for they know not what they do."

41:42.144 --> 41:44.105
Why didn't he fight?

41:44.187 --> 41:46.941
Why did he allow himself
to be sacrificed?

41:48.358 --> 41:50.694
I ask myself that question a lot.

41:50.778 --> 41:53.072
I understand the Old Testament God,

41:53.155 --> 41:54.615
whose power is absolute,

41:54.698 --> 41:58.035
who rules through fear, but... him.

42:04.666 --> 42:07.502
There's no such thing
as absolute power for us,

42:07.586 --> 42:09.463
except on the receiving end.

42:10.547 --> 42:12.716
Using fear will get you nowhere.

42:12.800 --> 42:15.427
It's not your job
to determine what's just.

42:15.510 --> 42:19.014
It's not your place to choose
the version of God you like best.

42:19.098 --> 42:21.308
It's not your duty
to serve this country alone,

42:21.391 --> 42:24.394
and it better not be your goal
to simply serve yourself.

42:24.478 --> 42:26.688
You serve the Lord.

42:26.772 --> 42:30.067
And through him, you serve others.

42:30.151 --> 42:35.030
Two rules:
Love God. Love each other.

42:35.114 --> 42:37.365
Period.

42:37.449 --> 42:40.161
You weren't chosen, Mr. President.

42:42.663 --> 42:44.623
Only he was.

42:50.629 --> 42:53.090
May I have a few moments?

42:53.174 --> 42:56.635
For myself. To pray.

42:58.679 --> 43:00.472
It's all yours.

43:33.172 --> 43:34.589
Love?

43:35.632 --> 43:37.509
That's what you're selling?

43:41.180 --> 43:43.431
Well, I don't buy it.

44:07.748 --> 44:09.750
Is everything all right, sir?

44:11.001 --> 44:13.962
I was praying and it just fell.

44:38.695 --> 44:41.240
Please have someone clean this up.

44:41.323 --> 44:43.450
Yes, sir.

44:43.533 --> 44:45.327
Well, I've got God's ear now.

44:45.451 --> 47:08.292
