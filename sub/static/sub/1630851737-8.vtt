WEBVTT

00:08.875 --> 00:10.916
Cha-chung!

00:19.291 --> 00:20.500
-Hurry, Zyanya.

00:20.583 --> 00:22.375
-We're almost there.

00:25.375 --> 00:28.208
-They're gaining on us!
-Keep going.

00:28.291 --> 00:30.208
I will buy you some time.

00:30.291 --> 00:31.458
No.

00:33.875 --> 00:36.458
-Ow.

00:56.250 --> 00:58.416
Shh, silencio, por favor.

01:00.708 --> 01:02.625
Por favor, Zatz.

01:02.708 --> 01:04.083
The river is not far.

01:04.166 --> 01:05.666
-We'll never make it.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.208
Then we'll die trying.

01:18.833 --> 01:21.583
-Camazotz, there's the canoe.

01:21.666 --> 01:23.041
-Get in! Now!

01:24.750 --> 01:26.166
Pass Zatz to me.

01:27.375 --> 01:30.708
You will protect Zatz
better than I ever could.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.625
-Zyanya sorry, mi amor.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.166
-I buy you time.

01:39.666 --> 01:41.000
-Zatz…

01:41.083 --> 01:43.833
-…I always with you.

01:56.833 --> 01:59.625
-Come and get some, you monstruos!

01:59.708 --> 02:02.291
-Barbarians!

02:08.625 --> 02:10.208
Zyanya?

02:12.083 --> 02:13.000
Zyanya?

02:16.708 --> 02:20.000
Zyanya!

02:20.083 --> 02:22.000
-I am here, mi amor.

02:22.083 --> 02:25.833
-I will always be here.

02:25.916 --> 02:26.875
Zyanya.

03:02.208 --> 03:03.666
Take care of them, Mama.

03:07.541 --> 03:09.583
Has all the snake poison passed?

03:09.666 --> 03:11.291
-Yes.

03:13.291 --> 03:15.916
-Whoa!
-We're going down!

03:25.708 --> 03:26.958
-Whoa!

03:30.291 --> 03:32.416
-Is everyone all right?

03:34.875 --> 03:35.708
Agh!

03:36.333 --> 03:37.541
Where are we?

03:37.625 --> 03:38.666
Hidden, for now.

03:42.625 --> 03:45.166
It's hurt. Chimi, do you speak owl?

03:45.250 --> 03:47.125
That's not a regular owl.

03:50.583 --> 03:52.625
-What in the gods'?

03:57.458 --> 03:59.000
Lady Micte?

03:59.541 --> 04:02.541
The goddess of death?
The goddess of death!

04:03.583 --> 04:06.916
Please, I beg you,
can you introduce me to my mother?

04:09.583 --> 04:11.791
In time, yes, Chimi.

04:12.791 --> 04:14.375
-We need to help her.

04:14.458 --> 04:16.791
-Can we trust her?

04:16.875 --> 04:18.666
She just saved our lives.

04:25.958 --> 04:27.625
Awesome.

04:30.458 --> 04:33.791
I'm sorry I could not
carry you all to safety.

04:33.875 --> 04:35.583
-Ay.
-Your Majesty!

04:35.666 --> 04:38.791
I must get you to Teca.

04:38.875 --> 04:41.250
Sure, but after you regain your strength…

04:41.333 --> 04:43.916
…your goddessness?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.333
You should rest, Lady Micte.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.333
Yes.

04:47.416 --> 04:51.875
I'm just gonna rest
with my eyes closed, mija.

04:52.791 --> 04:53.916
Don't call me that.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.708
-I deserve that.

05:03.125 --> 05:04.583
This is all my fault.

05:06.250 --> 05:09.125
If I hadn't been
so consumed with vengeance,

05:09.208 --> 05:11.000
none of this would've happened.

05:11.083 --> 05:13.708
We all knew what we were signing up for.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.208
And Picchu…

05:18.166 --> 05:20.875
He sacrificed himself for us.

05:20.958 --> 05:25.541
-He died a warrior's death.
-Yeah. He's with his family now.

05:28.583 --> 05:31.333
-This is all my fault.

05:48.791 --> 05:51.125
Your friend Picchu was a great warrior.

05:52.958 --> 05:55.791
-The best.
-I'm sorry for your loss.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.250
And I'm so sorry
about your father and Colmillo.

06:01.500 --> 06:04.041
They are in a better place.

06:04.125 --> 06:06.750
I hate when people say that.
You don't know that.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.833
Actually, I do.

06:10.250 --> 06:12.541
My mother died when I was just an infant.

06:12.625 --> 06:15.458
So every night before I went to bed,

06:15.541 --> 06:19.416
my father would share a story about her
to keep her memory alive.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.750
But one night,
I refused to hear another story.

06:22.833 --> 06:25.083
I told my father they made me sad.

06:26.541 --> 06:30.458
That's when my father
let me in on a little secret.

06:30.541 --> 06:35.708
He said since my mother died selflessly,
she's now a star in the sky.

06:35.791 --> 06:39.208
And she's always there
looking after me. There.

06:40.166 --> 06:41.000
That's Mama.

06:44.708 --> 06:47.166
And that's Papa.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.750
They're beautiful.

06:48.833 --> 06:50.333
And now they're together.

06:51.041 --> 06:51.875
Forever.

07:09.208 --> 07:12.208
But some stars
don't belong in the sky just yet.

07:13.916 --> 07:16.125
Picchu was always thinking of us.

07:16.833 --> 07:20.291
Remember how he'd carry me on his
shoulders for hours and never complain?

07:20.375 --> 07:24.750
Yeah. You remember how he used to
fist bump me and crack my ribs?

07:24.833 --> 07:26.166
Eh!

07:26.250 --> 07:28.750
He was the closest thing
I ever had to a brother.

07:30.458 --> 07:31.291
-Oh!

07:31.375 --> 07:33.583
Relax. Lady Micte won't hurt you.

07:33.666 --> 07:35.416
You don't know that.

07:35.500 --> 07:39.291
When this is all over, Lady Micte's
gonna introduce me to my mother.

07:39.875 --> 07:43.083
There you are.
We were worried about you.

07:43.166 --> 07:45.000
What's the plan, Eagle Warrior?

07:45.833 --> 07:47.500
Lord Mictlan cannot be stopped.

07:48.791 --> 07:50.791
Then we fight till the end.

07:50.875 --> 07:53.291
You must return to your kingdoms at once.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.500
There's no prophecy.
Tell your rulers I was wrong.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.875
-I was wrong about a lot of things.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.208
And now I need you to warn everyone.

08:03.791 --> 08:05.583
I will not abandon my pack.

08:05.666 --> 08:08.333
When Lord Mictlan is done destroying Teca,

08:08.416 --> 08:11.541
he will unleash his fury
on the rest of your kingdoms.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.500
You must convince them to evacuate.

08:13.583 --> 08:16.166
Bu-Bu-Bu-But we were
outcasts in our kingdoms.

08:16.250 --> 08:19.833
-They'll never listen to us.
-They have to listen to you.

08:21.708 --> 08:24.958
Zatz, the barbarians evacuated
the Golden Mountains.

08:25.041 --> 08:27.250
-Can you track them down?
-Absolutely.

08:27.333 --> 08:31.750
Find the Barbarian King and Princess.
Tell them about Picchu's sacrifice.

08:33.750 --> 08:35.041
Hurry. Go now.

08:36.458 --> 08:40.083
Wait. What about you?
We can't just leave you here, Maya.

08:40.166 --> 08:42.916
I'll stay with Lady Micte
until she regains her strength,

08:43.000 --> 08:46.333
and then I will make her tell me
how to kill her husband.

08:46.916 --> 08:50.250
Then we'll return to Teca
and prepare to fight till the end.

08:50.333 --> 08:52.500
-We will buy you time.

08:52.583 --> 08:57.791
And let it be known to all the kingdoms
that Teca went out fighting for them.

08:57.875 --> 08:58.708
-But--
-Go.

08:58.791 --> 09:01.875
Go now, while you still have
the cover of darkness.

09:06.541 --> 09:08.541
Be well, Princess Maya.

09:24.083 --> 09:24.916
Maya?

09:30.083 --> 09:32.625
-Thank you, mija.
-You don't get to call me that.

09:32.708 --> 09:33.666
Perdon.

09:35.041 --> 09:35.875
You're right.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.458
Where are your friends?

09:44.541 --> 09:49.958
I sent them away to warn their kingdoms
that your husband is coming to kill them.

09:50.041 --> 09:52.916
-One friend dying for me is one too many.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.083
I can't lose another one.

09:56.791 --> 09:58.250
I felt Picchu's death.

10:01.708 --> 10:03.375
-For him--

10:06.916 --> 10:09.375
For him, it was not a loss.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.166
It was a triumph.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.208
You…

10:13.291 --> 10:16.916
Why? Why'd you save me?
Why the change of heart?

10:18.666 --> 10:21.250
You hated me. You wanted me dead.

10:23.333 --> 10:26.541
-Long ago, when I was a young goddess…

10:26.625 --> 10:28.583
…all I cared about was power.

10:29.083 --> 10:33.083
That is why I married
the mightiest god of all.

10:34.833 --> 10:36.166
Lord Mictlan.

10:36.708 --> 10:38.750
He become drunk with power.

10:39.458 --> 10:43.791
I knew it was just a matter of time
before he turned on me.

10:43.875 --> 10:44.958
You did?

10:45.958 --> 10:50.000
That is when I discovered
the god who sacrificed a half human,

10:50.083 --> 10:54.750
half god of death, would become
the most powerful god in the underworld.

10:55.583 --> 10:57.333
So I gave birth to you.

10:57.416 --> 10:59.708
-So you can sacrifice me?

10:59.791 --> 11:01.166
No se, Maya

11:02.791 --> 11:05.625
But death itself grew a heart.

11:05.708 --> 11:09.166
And from the moment
I first held you in my arms,

11:09.250 --> 11:12.666
-you became all that mattered to me.

11:12.750 --> 11:15.875
I had created a life. You.

11:15.958 --> 11:18.083
It changed me forever.

11:18.166 --> 11:19.958
But you were never there.

11:20.041 --> 11:21.500
I was there.

11:21.583 --> 11:24.125
I risked everything to visit you

11:24.208 --> 11:27.041
-every year on your day of birth.

11:27.125 --> 11:28.458
¿Qué?

11:51.291 --> 11:53.458
Hey, that's my favorite melody.

11:53.541 --> 11:54.541
Mine too.

11:55.250 --> 11:58.000
Some say it was here before the world

11:58.083 --> 12:02.291
-and will remain after it ends.

12:11.041 --> 12:14.958
I couldn't let Lord Mictlan know
I was coming to see you.

12:15.041 --> 12:16.916
Oh, Mama.

12:17.875 --> 12:19.833
I'm so sorry, mija.

12:20.333 --> 12:23.083
-Mmm.
-I will always be by your side.

12:23.166 --> 12:25.166
Always.

12:40.416 --> 12:43.041
Once we get to Teca, we must-- Huh?

12:43.125 --> 12:45.083
-Whoa!

12:55.750 --> 12:57.958
Mama! Papa!

12:58.958 --> 13:00.708
Ay, thank the dioses! Maya's back.

13:00.791 --> 13:02.708
-You did it!

13:02.791 --> 13:05.208
Wait. Where are your warrior friends?

13:05.291 --> 13:07.708
Remember when I promised
we'd cross the Endless Forest

13:07.791 --> 13:09.416
to destroy the Divine Gate?

13:09.500 --> 13:11.666
-Yes. Why?
-Oh no.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.625
-Well, instead,

13:13.708 --> 13:18.083
I convinced them to go through the gate
and storm Lord Mictlan's temple.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.083
Oh, Maya.

13:21.375 --> 13:23.791
I thought
we were the true prophecy.

13:23.875 --> 13:25.208
I thought… I believed.

13:26.083 --> 13:28.000
I was… I was wrong.

13:28.916 --> 13:30.250
And because of me,

13:31.541 --> 13:33.916
my friend died helping us escape.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.375
Oh no. How did the rest of you get out?

13:37.750 --> 13:39.041
We were flown to safety.

13:49.291 --> 13:54.375
Thank you for saving my daughter, my lady.
I am the Queen of the Teca. And you are?

13:54.958 --> 13:56.083
Lady Micte.

13:59.750 --> 14:02.208
-So, how's it going?

14:03.541 --> 14:06.083
Would you like to join us
for dinner, my lady?

14:06.166 --> 14:07.708
What?

14:07.791 --> 14:10.666
I would love to.
Uh, is this all right, Maya?

14:11.166 --> 14:12.000
Uh…

14:16.958 --> 14:19.166
-Eat up, Papa.

14:19.250 --> 14:22.416
-This could very well be our last meal.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.875
Mmm. Not bad.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.833
-That came out quite good.

14:31.458 --> 14:34.791
Thank you for raising Maya
as your own, Queen Teca.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.291
-More pulque, please!

14:37.375 --> 14:41.250
The moment I saw her, it was as if
she were my own flesh and blood.

14:41.916 --> 14:44.875
Having two mothers is amazing.

14:45.708 --> 14:50.333
Thank you for saving Maya when she
foolishly tried to fight your husband.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.125
Well, I can see that she gets
her foolishness from your husband.

14:56.208 --> 14:57.875
What?

14:59.541 --> 15:01.291
-Hey!
-Don't "hey" your mother.

15:01.375 --> 15:03.083
-But--
-You heard your mother.

15:06.041 --> 15:07.875
Having two mothers stinks.

15:12.500 --> 15:17.875
It's so wonderful that you two
can get past your anger and laugh together

15:17.958 --> 15:20.458
-after all that's happened.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.416
Meow, meow-meow-meow-meow, meow!

15:38.500 --> 15:40.166
What's that you say, Chiapa?

15:40.250 --> 15:44.083
-You need to go outside for the pee-pees?
-What?

15:45.583 --> 15:47.708
Huh? Oh!

15:47.791 --> 15:51.166
And you need me and Papa
to take you out back?

15:51.791 --> 15:54.458
-Chiapa's so needy.

15:54.541 --> 15:56.541
When you gotta go, you gotta go.

15:56.625 --> 15:58.916
-Come on, you big gato.

16:00.625 --> 16:02.375
We'll be back soon.

16:02.458 --> 16:03.291
-Ouch!

16:03.375 --> 16:06.083
-Ay, like father…
-Like daughter.

16:09.291 --> 16:14.750
Your Highness, my husband
and the other gods are coming.

16:15.333 --> 16:16.375
I understand.

16:16.958 --> 16:19.791
Are you sure you should fight?

16:22.791 --> 16:24.166
We don't have a choice.

16:26.208 --> 16:28.458
-And that is the source of their power.

16:29.916 --> 16:30.875
For Teca!

16:34.375 --> 16:35.375
Come on, Estefan.

16:36.375 --> 16:38.791
-Easy. Easy.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.125
-Whoa!

16:52.083 --> 16:54.375
For Teca!

16:58.541 --> 17:00.208
For Teca!

17:02.000 --> 17:04.750
-We shall fight to the end!

17:08.666 --> 17:12.041
Tadow! How you like me now?

17:12.125 --> 17:13.125
Huh?

17:14.791 --> 17:16.333
El Monstruo Blanco!

17:16.916 --> 17:17.833
Lower your weapons.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.541
Welcome home, Chimi.

17:29.291 --> 17:32.291
The Great Puma Warrior saved our lives.

17:33.250 --> 17:34.958
Oh no! Picchu.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.416
-Now, Maya, listen carefully.

17:40.500 --> 17:45.041
In both realms, you are the only one
who can kill Lord Mictlan.

17:45.125 --> 17:46.750
I understand.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.375
You must stab him in the-- Agh!

17:49.750 --> 17:50.958
Mama!

17:52.333 --> 17:53.375
My lady?

17:53.458 --> 17:55.500
-War is upon us.

17:55.583 --> 17:56.625
To the plaza!

17:59.500 --> 18:01.416
Brave daughters of Teca,

18:02.083 --> 18:06.833
for too long we have lived in fear
of Lord Mictlan and his evil gods.

18:06.916 --> 18:09.958
-He has savagely ripped away our fathers,

18:10.041 --> 18:12.833
brothers, husbands, and sons.

18:13.458 --> 18:16.250
And he has only just begun.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.125
The evil gods will

18:18.208 --> 18:21.291
d-d-d-destroy the Kingdom of Teca!

18:22.583 --> 18:23.666
And when they're done…

18:23.750 --> 18:25.916
They will turn their vengeance on us.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.291
-So we have a choice to make.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.833
We can run and hide…

18:30.916 --> 18:33.833
Or we can join forces with Teca

18:33.916 --> 18:35.791
and we can fight!

18:35.875 --> 18:39.500
Alone, each kingdom is a mere finger.

18:39.583 --> 18:42.791
But together,
we create a mighty fist!

18:43.875 --> 18:47.166
Now is the time to stop living in fear.

18:47.833 --> 18:50.083
Now is the time to fight.

18:50.583 --> 18:52.958
Not to avenge the deaths
of our loved ones…

18:54.000 --> 18:57.750
…but to secure the warrior spirits
in generations to come.

18:57.833 --> 19:00.875
Yes, yesterday we mourned, but today,

19:00.958 --> 19:03.708
today we fight for our future!

19:09.958 --> 19:11.416
-Whoa!

19:18.625 --> 19:20.083
Here we go.

19:36.625 --> 19:38.666
-Steady, my warriors.

19:53.625 --> 19:57.125
Tonight, I will devour your souls.

19:58.291 --> 20:01.375
If we die, die fighting together.

20:03.666 --> 20:06.666
-Agh!

20:06.750 --> 20:08.666
Congratulations, half-breed.

20:11.625 --> 20:13.083
You just ensured the death

20:13.166 --> 20:15.791
-of your entire civilization.

20:18.041 --> 20:20.583
-Huh?

20:20.666 --> 20:22.833
You sure about that, two-face?

20:22.916 --> 20:25.916
-Luna Island stands with Teca.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.333
I-- I-- I know you told us to run,
but I've never been a good listener.

20:32.958 --> 20:34.250
I'm not sorry, Maya.

20:36.916 --> 20:39.375
The Jungle Kingdom stands with Teca.

20:39.458 --> 20:41.916
Barbarians!

20:42.000 --> 20:44.250
Hey, I missed you.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.583
The Golden Mountains Kingdom

20:47.666 --> 20:49.500
-stands with Teca.

20:53.583 --> 20:56.166
-The prophecy was real.

20:56.833 --> 21:01.333
It was that all the kingdoms
come together to fight for each other.

21:01.416 --> 21:02.833
Teca is the Eagle,

21:02.916 --> 21:04.958
Luna Island is the Rooster,

21:05.041 --> 21:07.250
the Jungle Lands are the Skull,

21:07.333 --> 21:10.166
the Golden Mountains are the Puma.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.041
This changes nothing.

21:12.125 --> 21:15.583
The age of mortals is over.

21:15.666 --> 21:18.416
-"Meet a nice human girl," my father said.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.166
-Ha!

21:20.250 --> 21:22.791
Mwah! Just in case
I never get to do that again.

21:26.666 --> 21:30.166
-If it is to be…
-It is up to me!
