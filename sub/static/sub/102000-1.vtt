<i>Oh.</i>

01:04.741 --> 01:06.241
<i>Uh.</i>

01:06.275 --> 01:09.211
<i>Come on, you blithering idiot.</i>

01:09.244 --> 01:11.381
<i>There's only 26 letters
in the damned alphabet.</i>

01:11.414 --> 01:14.016
<i>All you've gotta do is put
them in the right bloody order.</i>

01:19.321 --> 01:20.657
Write something.

01:21.658 --> 01:22.492
Anything.

01:40.910 --> 01:42.044
Right.

01:42.779 --> 01:43.580
Music.

01:56.860 --> 01:57.660
Charles.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.401
Think.

02:31.461 --> 02:32.294
Charles?

02:33.496 --> 02:34.764
Darling?

02:34.797 --> 02:38.333
Charles? They can
hear you in Timbuktu!

02:43.606 --> 02:44.707
Much obliged.

02:50.279 --> 02:52.882
If you insist on living
like a nocturnal animal,

02:52.916 --> 02:55.418
at least be civil enough
to hide your tracks.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.755
Morning, Edith.

02:58.788 --> 02:59.989
Good morning, ma'am.

03:00.023 --> 03:02.825
Oh, he's finally
gone through with it.

03:02.859 --> 03:05.528
Oh yes.
Scandalous, isn't it?

03:05.562 --> 03:07.296
On the contrary, I
think giving up the throne

03:07.329 --> 03:08.932
for love is awfully romantic.

03:08.965 --> 03:11.868
I'll have a grilled grapefruit
and a strong coffee please.

03:15.038 --> 03:16.606
Mr. Condomine's
asked for his eggs

03:16.639 --> 03:17.907
to be brought out
to his study again.

03:17.941 --> 03:19.341
Well, given his
mood, I hope they're

03:19.374 --> 03:21.176
being served sunny side up.

03:22.979 --> 03:24.514
Here we go.

03:24.547 --> 03:30.587
Two soft-boiled eggs.
For William Shakespeare.

03:30.620 --> 03:32.589
And what does Her Majesty
want this morning?

03:32.622 --> 03:34.691
She's sticking to the
Hollywood diet.

03:34.724 --> 03:35.692
Hollywood diet.

03:37.627 --> 03:40.228
It'll take a lot more
than an exotic fruit

03:40.262 --> 03:42.065
to turn her into Greta Garbo.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.067
Oh.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.035
And don't dilly-dally
in the garden, Edith.

03:46.069 --> 03:48.705
He'll only send it back,
if the toast is cold.

04:02.385 --> 04:04.721
I'm not a bad man.

04:04.754 --> 04:07.056
I mean, yes, I like
to flirt a bit.

04:08.725 --> 04:11.728
And the occasional flutter.

04:14.030 --> 04:15.832
Excuse me, sir.
Your breakfast.

04:28.411 --> 04:29.244
Edith.

04:30.380 --> 04:32.382
Yes, sir?

04:32.415 --> 04:34.884
Would you remind Edna
that the word 'toast'

04:34.917 --> 04:38.253
is derived from
the Latin 'tostare',

04:38.286 --> 04:41.624
meaning 'to scorch' or
'to roast'?

04:41.658 --> 04:46.663
Whereas this... is a
cold, hard piece of bread.

04:49.132 --> 04:50.533
Apologies, sir.

04:51.366 --> 04:52.234
Thank you.

04:53.569 --> 04:55.004
Do you need anything else?

04:56.139 --> 04:57.440
Divine intervention.

05:02.545 --> 05:04.847
It's wonderfully
patriotic, Harold.

05:04.881 --> 05:06.916
You've really excelled yourself.

05:06.949 --> 05:08.818
And I'm certain the
judges will agree.

05:12.021 --> 05:13.122
Oh!

05:25.001 --> 05:26.669
How was it so easy for you,

05:28.137 --> 05:29.639
my Manhattan muse?

05:33.776 --> 05:35.310
Charles.

05:35.343 --> 05:37.780
You really should be
praying to Cadmus

05:37.814 --> 05:39.482
and not decapitating him.

05:39.515 --> 05:41.249
I'm sorry.

05:41.283 --> 05:44.286
You've been commissioned to
write a 90-page screenplay,

05:44.319 --> 05:46.189
not <i>War and Peace.</i>

05:47.289 --> 05:49.092
I'm at my wits' end.

05:49.125 --> 05:51.160
I just don't understand
how it can be so problematic

05:51.194 --> 05:54.063
to adapt a story that
you've already written.

05:55.330 --> 05:56.899
I'm sorry, Charles. I
just don't know how long

05:56.933 --> 05:59.202
I can go on like
this, with you stuck

05:59.234 --> 06:03.606
in an imaginary world and
me alone in the real one.

06:04.741 --> 06:05.675
I miss you.

06:08.010 --> 06:08.845
I miss us.

06:10.947 --> 06:11.781
So do I.

06:20.757 --> 06:21.824
Look at that.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.662
Just found it
amongst some papers.

06:26.696 --> 06:29.165
It's sweet of you to
try and spare my feelings.

06:29.198 --> 06:31.033
And a little naive.

06:31.067 --> 06:32.367
Why?

06:32.401 --> 06:34.570
Because you imagine that I
mind you thinking of Elvira.

06:35.337 --> 06:37.272
Well, don't you?

06:37.305 --> 06:41.911
No. I'm not in
the least bit jealous of her.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.679
I just wonder if I died,
whether you'd continue

06:43.713 --> 06:45.280
to look at photographs of me.

06:46.382 --> 06:47.216
Darling.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.788
You're not the dying type.

06:54.490 --> 06:55.591
Ha!

06:55.625 --> 06:58.127
He's simply
incorrigible, Violet.

06:58.161 --> 07:01.464
I found him mooning over
pictures of Elvira yesterday.

07:01.497 --> 07:02.765
Elvira?

07:02.799 --> 07:05.300
He's been shirking work
and pining for the ex-wife.

07:06.636 --> 07:07.837
Ah!

07:07.870 --> 07:08.538
Oh!

07:09.438 --> 07:10.540
Game, set and match.

07:13.209 --> 07:16.112
There's really nothing
to feel insecure about.

07:16.145 --> 07:17.613
Elvira may have been
very attractive,

07:17.647 --> 07:19.682
but the poor woman's gone.

07:19.715 --> 07:21.884
As has the spark
in our relationship.

07:21.918 --> 07:23.318
Charles is a man.

07:23.351 --> 07:24.319
You can't expect him to juggle

07:24.352 --> 07:26.155
more than one thing at a time.

07:26.189 --> 07:29.458
My advice... leave him
to worry about the words

07:29.492 --> 07:31.661
and find someone else
to shake your sheets.

07:32.895 --> 07:34.897
Oh come on, don't be a prude.

07:34.931 --> 07:38.100
One must be practical for a
marriage to run the course.

07:38.134 --> 07:39.468
Do you remember
what you learnt

07:39.502 --> 07:41.971
in our last lesson,
Mrs. Bradman?

07:42.004 --> 07:45.708
Strong, firm grip.
How could I forget?

07:53.249 --> 07:56.886
So, what seems to be
the trouble, old chap?

07:56.919 --> 07:59.789
Things don't seem to be
flowing as they used to.

07:59.822 --> 08:01.991
Oh.

08:02.024 --> 08:03.993
Name me a wordsmith who
hasn't wrestled with a bout

08:04.026 --> 08:07.530
of writer's block
once in a while, eh.

08:07.563 --> 08:09.599
And the truth is,
it's not just the words

08:09.632 --> 08:10.566
that have dried up.

08:12.268 --> 08:13.769
Hm-hm.

08:13.803 --> 08:15.671
Big Ben's stopped chiming.

08:17.707 --> 08:19.108
Hm.

08:19.141 --> 08:22.178
Mr. Peasbody's
got stage fright.

08:22.211 --> 08:24.447
Oh, you poor fellow.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.415
It's like playing
billiards with a rope.

08:29.952 --> 08:32.255
Try a couple of these.

08:32.288 --> 08:34.323
Should put some
fuel back in your tank.

08:34.357 --> 08:35.291
What are they?

08:35.323 --> 08:36.859
Benzedrine sulfate.

08:36.893 --> 08:39.562
amphetamine.

08:39.595 --> 08:41.831
Enhances cheerfulness,

08:41.864 --> 08:44.533
alertness, and as
Violet would testify,

08:44.567 --> 08:47.069
does wonders for your libido.

08:47.103 --> 08:49.405
Sounds too good to be
true. Is it habit forming?

08:49.438 --> 08:52.074
No, not at all. Been
using them for years.

09:00.283 --> 09:01.617
Ah.

09:01.651 --> 09:03.486
Ah, slow down.

09:03.519 --> 09:05.221
Charles, you'll give
us both a coronary.

09:05.254 --> 09:08.257
I've never
felt more alive.

09:08.291 --> 09:09.859
Why? What's happened?

09:09.892 --> 09:11.994
I decided to take your advice

09:12.028 --> 09:13.829
and look on the positives.

09:13.863 --> 09:16.198
Surely it's better
to be up than down.

09:16.232 --> 09:17.466
I just don't want
you to exhaust yourself

09:17.500 --> 09:19.936
before the medium show
at the theater tonight.

09:19.969 --> 09:21.437
Ugh.

09:21.470 --> 09:23.606
Nobody in their right mind
would waste a perfectly

09:23.639 --> 09:25.574
pleasant evening
pretending to be fascinated

09:25.608 --> 09:27.710
by someone holding a
one-way conversation.

09:28.511 --> 09:29.345
- Ah.
- Ah.

09:33.417 --> 09:35.952
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, please take your seats.</i>

09:35.985 --> 09:39.355
<i>This evening's performance
will commence in two minutes.</i>

09:39.389 --> 09:40.957
Isn't that your cook?

09:42.325 --> 09:44.560
And your maid?

09:44.593 --> 09:47.029
Oh yes. So it is.

09:47.063 --> 09:48.331
Poor Edith.

09:48.364 --> 09:50.132
She's been very taken
with this sort of thing

09:50.166 --> 09:53.836
since she lost her brother
fighting the fascists in Spain.

09:53.869 --> 09:56.372
Primitive superstition
can be very persuasive.

09:56.406 --> 09:58.207
Especially with the
emotionally susceptible.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.809
Hm.

10:14.590 --> 10:16.859
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:16.892 --> 10:19.862
welcome to an evening
that will change

10:19.895 --> 10:23.467
your perceptions of
the world we inhabit.

10:25.668 --> 10:28.170
That will answer, irrefutably,

10:29.505 --> 10:33.075
the question that has
confounded mankind

10:33.109 --> 10:35.044
since the dawn of time.

10:38.848 --> 10:42.051
Is there life after death?

10:43.686 --> 10:44.488
No.

10:52.261 --> 10:53.362
There she is.

11:03.272 --> 11:06.809
Mesdames et messeurs, bonsoir.

11:09.879 --> 11:14.283
From the Great Pyramid
of Cholula in the West

11:15.519 --> 11:19.155
to Mount Taishan in the east,

11:19.188 --> 11:21.757
from Whanganui-a-Tara
in the south

11:21.791 --> 11:23.759
to Uppsala in the north,

11:24.627 --> 11:27.096
I have traveled the globe,

11:27.129 --> 11:31.567
communing with gurus,
swamis and shaman.

11:32.568 --> 11:36.205
These wise sages have guided me

11:36.238 --> 11:39.608
to a deeper dimension

11:39.642 --> 11:44.647
where finally I
experienced an epiphany

11:44.680 --> 11:49.419
and broke through
to the other side.

11:57.993 --> 12:02.532
I am certain that everyone here

12:02.566 --> 12:06.936
has sensed the spirits of
their departed loved ones.

12:06.969 --> 12:09.839
And I am certain we all wish

12:09.872 --> 12:13.543
we could communicate
with them again

12:13.577 --> 12:17.880
to say the things
we never got to say.

12:17.913 --> 12:19.348
- I've got it. Sorry.
- Shh.

12:19.382 --> 12:24.387
Tonight, I will use the
precious mystical gift

12:26.255 --> 12:28.757
to make that possible.

12:31.127 --> 12:32.795
Bugger!

12:41.203 --> 12:43.372
Madame Arcati.

12:43.406 --> 12:46.242
Oh, it's a conjuring trick.

12:46.275 --> 12:48.378
I told you. She's a fraud.

12:48.411 --> 12:50.580
That's an
outrageous accusation.

12:51.847 --> 12:53.483
I merely lost contact.

12:53.517 --> 12:55.951
Charles was right. It
was all a put-up job.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.053
Where'd he go?

12:58.921 --> 13:00.189
Please, please.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.859
Madame Arcati has
just been through

13:03.893 --> 13:06.295
a very traumatic experience.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.398
Please just... Please.

13:08.431 --> 13:10.400
I would
ask you to respect

13:10.433 --> 13:13.969
her privacy at this
difficult time.

13:14.003 --> 13:15.704
<i>Oh, my giddy aunt!</i>

13:19.909 --> 13:21.611
<i>I've
told you, Mandeep,</i>

13:21.645 --> 13:23.979
<i>I don't want to
see a living soul.</i>

13:24.947 --> 13:27.283
My name is Charles Condomine.

13:27.316 --> 13:28.851
I'm an award-winning writer.

13:28.884 --> 13:31.220
And especially not
the gutter press.

13:31.253 --> 13:34.256
Look, I'm not a reporter.
I write crime novels,

13:34.290 --> 13:35.525
and screenplays.

13:35.559 --> 13:38.194
Well, I can't abide
fiction or fantasy.

13:42.499 --> 13:43.332
Madame Arcati?

13:45.134 --> 13:47.803
I'm not here to
question your integrity.

13:47.836 --> 13:51.541
Faking an exotic accent doesn't
mean your gift isn't real.

13:51.575 --> 13:54.710
I fully understand that, like
me, you occasionally have

13:54.743 --> 13:57.780
to employ a certain
artistic license

13:57.813 --> 13:59.649
to entertain the masses.

13:59.683 --> 14:02.686
They expect me to
deliver a spectacle,

14:02.718 --> 14:07.223
a transcendental miracle,
night after night.

14:07.256 --> 14:10.226
Of course, of course. There's
no need to justify yourself.

14:10.259 --> 14:11.227
I'm a believer.

14:13.496 --> 14:15.632
I'm simply here to
invite you to conduct

14:15.665 --> 14:18.133
a private seance at my home.

14:18.167 --> 14:20.403
Well. I'm not a traveling
banjo player, Mr. Condomine.

14:20.437 --> 14:23.138
I don't do requests.

14:23.172 --> 14:26.308
Well, there might be some
influential guests attending.

14:27.711 --> 14:29.546
Could be the perfect
opportunity to fend off

14:29.579 --> 14:33.282
any bad publicity from
tonight's unfortunate events.

14:36.553 --> 14:38.854
When were you wishing
this to take place?

14:39.922 --> 14:41.023
As soon as possible.

14:42.858 --> 14:45.395
Then I suggest this Thursday,

14:45.428 --> 14:49.331
midsummer night, the solstice.

14:49.365 --> 14:53.068
The sacred turning
point of the seasons.

14:56.473 --> 14:58.475
Perfect.

14:58.508 --> 15:00.510
I told her how
profoundly interested I was

15:00.543 --> 15:01.910
in anything to do
with the occult,

15:01.944 --> 15:03.380
and she blossomed like a rose.

15:03.413 --> 15:05.080
Well, hosting an evening
with a professional charlatan

15:05.114 --> 15:06.616
sounds like an absolute scream.

15:06.650 --> 15:07.983
Doesn't it?

15:08.017 --> 15:09.852
But will it get you closer
to finishing your screenplay?

15:09.885 --> 15:11.253
Well, I need the
old girl to show me

15:11.287 --> 15:12.756
a few tricks of the trade.

15:12.788 --> 15:14.356
That's what's gonna make
my new hero truly unique.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.526
What's so unique about him?

15:16.559 --> 15:17.359
He's dead.

15:17.394 --> 15:18.193
Dead?

15:18.227 --> 15:19.396
As a doornail.

15:19.429 --> 15:21.196
He's the victim of a
vicious unsolved murder

15:21.230 --> 15:23.332
and communicates with the
living through a medium

15:23.365 --> 15:25.635
who helps bring people
back from beyond the grave.

15:25.669 --> 15:28.237
Maybe she could resurrect
your career at the same time.

15:28.270 --> 15:29.439
Daddy's on the warpath.

15:29.472 --> 15:30.674
He's certain to
find another writer

15:30.707 --> 15:32.308
if you don't deliver soon.

15:58.802 --> 16:00.503
Is anybody there?

16:04.741 --> 16:07.142
Is anybody there?

16:07.176 --> 16:10.879
One rap for yes,
two raps for no.

16:14.249 --> 16:15.084
Ooh.

16:16.553 --> 16:18.187
Is that you, Maia?

16:18.220 --> 16:19.188
Who's Maia?

16:19.221 --> 16:21.123
My spirit guide.

16:21.156 --> 16:23.325
She was Tutankhamun's wet nurse.

16:24.561 --> 16:26.228
I do hope she's
not still lactating.

16:28.097 --> 16:32.167
I would ask you not to
be flippant, Dr. Bradman.

16:32.201 --> 16:36.305
She may be in Shamballa, but
the woman still has feelings.

16:36.338 --> 16:39.074
Please forgive
me, Madame Arcati.

16:39.108 --> 16:40.643
I didn't mean to cause offense.

17:04.867 --> 17:07.368
Now we're getting somewhere.

17:09.304 --> 17:11.373
Is it me you wish to speak to?

17:13.810 --> 17:16.445
Is it Dr. Bradman?
Or perhaps one

17:16.479 --> 17:18.848
of his less fortunate patients?

17:21.550 --> 17:22.752
Mrs. Bradman?

17:26.489 --> 17:27.690
Mrs. Condomine?

17:29.358 --> 17:30.926
Oh, behave yourself, Maia.

17:32.595 --> 17:33.830
Mr. Condomine?

17:38.802 --> 17:40.603
It appears that
someone wishes to speak

17:40.637 --> 17:43.305
to you, Mr. Condomine.

17:43.338 --> 17:44.874
Do you know anyone
who has recently

17:44.908 --> 17:46.942
passed over to the other side?

17:46.975 --> 17:48.210
Only my old literary agent,

17:48.243 --> 17:49.412
but it's unlikely
he'd make contact.

17:49.446 --> 17:51.581
He died owing me a
fortune in royalties.

17:53.850 --> 17:56.886
Are you Mr. Condomine's
literary agent.

18:00.824 --> 18:02.459
No.

18:02.492 --> 18:04.059
I'm afraid we've drawn a blank.

18:06.429 --> 18:09.532
Is there anyone on the other
side you think of often?

18:16.773 --> 18:18.273
No, well, there's
nothing for it.

18:18.307 --> 18:20.008
I shall have to
go into a trance.

18:22.545 --> 18:24.980
This is the moment I hate.

18:25.013 --> 18:27.383
Are, are you nervous, or?

18:27.417 --> 18:29.419
When I was a child,
I used to be sick.

18:30.687 --> 18:31.888
Mm-hm.

18:31.921 --> 18:33.590
Now let's see,
what have we here?

18:35.123 --> 18:37.460
Oh, Brahms. No, that's
too dark and depressing.

18:38.761 --> 18:40.797
Rachmaninoff. No, too florid.

18:43.031 --> 18:44.734
Oh no, this is better.

18:44.767 --> 18:45.768
<i>Always.</i>

18:47.069 --> 18:48.370
Does it have to be that song?

18:48.404 --> 18:51.474
Well Maia likes a tune
she can hum along to.

19:05.488 --> 19:07.557
♪ Always ♪

19:12.996 --> 19:16.633
♪ I'll be loving you Always ♪

19:17.634 --> 19:22.472
♪ With a love
that's true Always ♪

19:22.505 --> 19:24.908
♪ Then the things you plan ♪

19:24.941 --> 19:27.410
♪ Need a helping hand ♪

19:27.443 --> 19:29.111
♪ I will understand ♪

19:37.554 --> 19:38.588
Crikey.

19:45.895 --> 19:47.497
What the devil's going on?

19:47.530 --> 19:49.364
Must be a power cut.

19:52.167 --> 19:56.305
Madame Arcati? Madame
Arcati, can you hear me?

19:56.338 --> 19:57.272
Is she breathing?

19:57.306 --> 19:59.909
She's having some sort of fit.

19:59.943 --> 20:01.778
Please, do something,
Dr. Bradman.

20:07.050 --> 20:07.984
Oh.

20:08.017 --> 20:09.318
Oh, thank goodness.

20:09.351 --> 20:10.553
What happened?

20:10.587 --> 20:11.688
Apart from the French
windows blowing open,

20:11.721 --> 20:12.989
nothing supernatural.

20:13.022 --> 20:16.325
Something
substantial took place.

20:16.358 --> 20:18.494
I can feel it in my base chakra.

20:18.528 --> 20:20.530
Probably trapped wind.

20:22.899 --> 20:24.734
No poltergeists, at any rate.

20:25.835 --> 20:27.670
Any apparitions?

20:27.704 --> 20:29.338
Uh, not that we saw.

20:29.371 --> 20:30.740
What about ectoplasm?

20:30.773 --> 20:32.207
I'm not quite
sure what that is.

20:32.240 --> 20:35.645
A supernatural viscous
substance that exudes

20:35.678 --> 20:38.514
from the body of one in
a spiritualistic trance

20:38.548 --> 20:42.819
and forms the material for
the manifestation of spirits.

20:42.852 --> 20:45.054
No, I definitely would
have remembered that.

20:45.088 --> 20:45.888
Mm-hm.

20:47.590 --> 20:49.859
Well. I suppose I should get
going before the storm rolls in.

20:49.892 --> 20:51.226
Would you care for
some refreshments

20:51.259 --> 20:52.695
before you return to your hotel?

20:52.729 --> 20:56.365
Oh. no, thank you, Mrs. Condomine.
I like to travel light.

20:56.399 --> 20:57.700
Congratulations,
Madame Arcati.

20:57.734 --> 20:59.535
It was a thrilling evening.

20:59.569 --> 21:03.673
I'm well aware of the irony
in your voice, Dr. Bradman.

21:03.706 --> 21:06.375
May I be so bold as to remind
you that modern medicine

21:06.409 --> 21:09.612
is a recent phenomena, and
that physicians have found

21:09.646 --> 21:13.449
value in scientifically
inexplicable practices

21:13.483 --> 21:16.052
since the beginning
of civilization?

21:16.085 --> 21:16.886
Quite so.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.355
Well, good night, everyone.

21:21.391 --> 21:23.960
I'm sorry so little eventuated.

21:23.993 --> 21:27.697
Probably something to
do with a cosmic flux.

21:27.730 --> 21:30.033
Thank you so much for agreeing
to do this, Madame Arcati.

21:30.066 --> 21:32.702
It's been an education
on so many levels.

21:32.735 --> 21:35.071
<i>Merci, Monsieur Condomine.</i>

21:36.873 --> 21:37.874
<i>Et au revoir.</i>

21:46.049 --> 21:48.017
Sh, sh sh, sh sh sh.

21:48.051 --> 21:49.819
She might hear us, sh.

21:49.852 --> 21:51.654
I can't. Really, I can't.

21:59.862 --> 22:03.231
I can't quite put my
finger on it, Donald.

22:03.265 --> 22:05.601
I've never experienced
anything like it in my life.

22:07.003 --> 22:09.105
It genuinely felt as if

22:10.973 --> 22:12.809
something tremendous
had happened.

22:18.748 --> 22:19.582
Oh well.

22:21.117 --> 22:22.317
Maybe next time.

22:24.887 --> 22:26.456
Good night, my love.

22:43.906 --> 22:46.576
Did you get everything you
need for your screenplay?

22:46.609 --> 22:50.480
Oh, everything
and more.

22:50.513 --> 22:53.315
You're not thinking of turning
in for the night, are you?

22:53.348 --> 22:54.150
What?

22:55.718 --> 22:56.986
Wouldn't it be
prudent to get down

22:57.019 --> 22:58.988
the ideas whilst
they're still fresh?

23:02.125 --> 23:04.794
Yes, well, absolutely.

23:04.827 --> 23:09.732
I shall, fix myself
a drink and dig in.

23:09.766 --> 23:11.467
<i>Carpe diem,</i>
darling.

23:13.669 --> 23:14.771
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

23:57.446 --> 23:58.481
Jesus Christ.

24:00.216 --> 24:01.117
Charles?

24:03.286 --> 24:05.121
What on Earth have you done?

24:07.557 --> 24:10.593
The room looks like
a giant peach melba.

24:13.095 --> 24:14.964
And where's my Italian
chandelier gone?

24:19.802 --> 24:20.603
What?

24:31.981 --> 24:32.815
Oh, God.

24:36.219 --> 24:37.587
Hello.

24:41.958 --> 24:45.061
Please tell me you haven't
ruined the rest of the house.

24:45.094 --> 24:46.562
No.

24:47.797 --> 24:51.334
My Moroccan mosaics. Charles.

24:51.366 --> 24:53.769
One weekend away and
the whole place has had

24:53.803 --> 24:56.572
the life and soul
sucked out of it.

24:56.606 --> 24:57.607
This can't be happening.

24:57.640 --> 24:58.908
I must be hallucinating.

24:58.941 --> 25:00.943
Well, judging from
the decor, I would say

25:00.977 --> 25:03.546
that's the understatement
of the century.

25:09.719 --> 25:12.255
I should have known
this wasn't down to you.

25:15.024 --> 25:15.858
Who is she?

25:17.460 --> 25:18.895
It's not what you think.

25:18.928 --> 25:23.666
Please do not humiliate
either one of us any further.

25:23.699 --> 25:25.067
If you've got
something to tell me,

25:25.101 --> 25:27.303
be a man and spit it out.

25:29.305 --> 25:32.808
Elvira... You're dead.

25:32.842 --> 25:34.543
How dare you?

25:51.160 --> 25:53.329
The last thing I
remember is competing

25:53.362 --> 25:56.299
in the South Downs
point-to-point.

25:56.332 --> 25:59.735
That's right, and the
conditions were treacherous,

25:59.769 --> 26:02.104
and as with most things, you
refused to listen to reason.

26:02.138 --> 26:04.106
Well I couldn't miss
the most prestigious meet

26:04.140 --> 26:05.508
of the season, Charles.

26:05.541 --> 26:07.276
Well, you paid the ultimate
price for your folly

26:07.310 --> 26:08.945
and fell at the final fence,

26:08.978 --> 26:11.914
instantly breaking your neck.

26:11.948 --> 26:12.949
The whole episode
was very distressing

26:12.982 --> 26:15.184
for everyone involved.

26:15.217 --> 26:19.021
Well, presumably not as
distressing as it was for me.

26:19.055 --> 26:20.890
They did rename the
jump in your honor.

26:20.923 --> 26:22.792
Oh.

26:22.825 --> 26:24.060
How thoughtful.

26:27.029 --> 26:28.197
I don't understand.

26:28.230 --> 26:30.900
If I'm dead, then how
and why am I here?

26:30.933 --> 26:32.868
I have absolutely no idea.

26:35.204 --> 26:37.106
Maybe you're a ghost.

26:37.139 --> 26:40.710
What? No!.

26:40.743 --> 26:42.379
Please, don't get hysterical.

26:42.412 --> 26:43.479
Hysterical?

26:44.381 --> 26:46.482
Concerned, more like.

26:46.515 --> 26:48.351
Procrastination is the
thief of time, Charles,

26:48.385 --> 26:50.586
and yours is running out.

26:50.619 --> 26:51.520
Who's she?

26:51.554 --> 26:52.655
My wife, Ruth.

26:52.688 --> 26:54.156
Yes? Are you all right?

26:54.190 --> 26:55.324
I'm your wife.

26:55.358 --> 26:56.325
Not anymore.

26:56.359 --> 26:57.860
Why? What's the matter?

26:57.893 --> 27:00.663
Ruth, I'm not speaking to
you. I'm talking to Elvira.

27:00.696 --> 27:01.897
Elvira?

27:01.931 --> 27:03.099
Yeah, surely you can see her.

27:03.132 --> 27:04.600
She's standing
right next to you.

27:04.633 --> 27:06.335
Charles, what are you
playing at? Elvira's dead.

27:06.369 --> 27:09.271
Ugh, why does everyone
have to keep saying that?

27:09.305 --> 27:10.573
Elvira, darling, this is Ruth.

27:10.606 --> 27:12.174
Ruth, darling, this is Elvira.

27:12.208 --> 27:13.909
Are you drunk?

27:13.943 --> 27:16.480
Ruth, Elvira is here
with us in the room.

27:16.512 --> 27:19.315
Madame Arcati must have summoned
her up during the seance.

27:19.348 --> 27:23.953
Madame Arcati's a fraud.
You said so yourself.

27:23.986 --> 27:28.190
I'm going to bed, and I
suggest that you retire too.

27:28.224 --> 27:30.726
Finally some time to ourselves
so we can get reacquainted.

27:30.760 --> 27:32.828
That's a thoroughly
immoral suggestion.

27:32.862 --> 27:37.333
Oh, I wasn't for a moment
insinuating we share a bed.

27:37.366 --> 27:38.502
No...

27:38.534 --> 27:39.935
I've come to terms with
your recent inability

27:39.969 --> 27:41.471
to perform in that department.

27:42.538 --> 27:44.040
Hm.

27:44.073 --> 27:46.308
I can't imagine you ever
did with that sourpuss.

27:46.342 --> 27:48.478
Be quiet. You're behaving
like a guttersnipe.

27:48.512 --> 27:52.014
It is your behavior,
Charles, that is unpardonable.

27:52.048 --> 27:54.183
Good night.

27:54.216 --> 27:55.718
Hooray.

27:55.751 --> 27:57.253
What a frightful woman.

27:57.286 --> 27:59.855
I can only assume it was
a marriage of convenience?

28:02.492 --> 28:03.325
Hmm.

28:03.359 --> 28:04.827
I've gone mad.

28:04.860 --> 28:07.296
That's what it is
Stark raving mad.

28:14.270 --> 28:17.441
It will ruin your life if you
allow it to get hold of you.

28:17.474 --> 28:18.741
Once and for all, Ruth,

28:18.774 --> 28:21.277
last night had nothing
to do with alcohol.

28:21.310 --> 28:23.012
I wasn't in the least drunk.

28:23.045 --> 28:25.881
Something very peculiar
happened to me.

28:25.915 --> 28:27.451
A one-off psychic delusion,

28:27.484 --> 28:29.251
likely brought on
by work pressure.

28:29.285 --> 28:31.821
A deadline doesn't explain
why when I calmly suggested

28:31.854 --> 28:33.589
that you should return to
bed, you said with a most

28:33.622 --> 28:35.157
disgusting leer that it
was an immoral suggestion.

28:35.191 --> 28:37.760
I thought I was
talking to Elvira.

28:37.793 --> 28:39.728
Well, if you were, I can
only say it conjures up

28:39.762 --> 28:41.531
a fragrant picture of
your first marriage.

28:41.565 --> 28:43.732
My first marriage
was perfectly charming.

28:43.766 --> 28:45.968
And it's in the worst possible
taste for you to sneer at it.

28:46.001 --> 28:47.670
I'm not nearly so interested
in your first marriage

28:47.703 --> 28:49.772
as you think I am.

28:49.805 --> 28:51.273
In fact, its your
second marriage

28:51.307 --> 28:52.808
that's absorbing
me at the moment.

28:52.842 --> 28:54.143
It's headed for the rocks.

28:58.381 --> 29:02.151
Well, it's 155 over
99. It is quite high.

29:03.219 --> 29:04.421
I'm not surprised,

29:04.454 --> 29:06.088
given the intensity
of the hallucination.

29:07.790 --> 29:10.693
I genuinely believed Elvira
was in the room talking to me.

29:11.627 --> 29:14.431
She was as real as you or I.

29:14.464 --> 29:16.932
Probably best you stop taking
the tablets, old chap.

29:20.269 --> 29:21.804
Darling.

29:24.206 --> 29:27.444
I hate to see you so upset.

29:27.477 --> 29:29.712
Please accept my heartfelt
apology for anything untoward

29:29.745 --> 29:31.847
I might have said last night.

29:31.881 --> 29:32.882
Or this morning.

29:34.250 --> 29:37.454
Apology accepted. Let's
never mention it again.

29:38.455 --> 29:40.856
How are you feeling?

29:40.890 --> 29:43.792
I believe Dr. Bradman
might have solved the riddle.

29:44.727 --> 29:46.729
Ah, well, thank goodness.

29:46.762 --> 29:49.932
Now, let's go and
see your father.

29:49.965 --> 29:51.167
I want to check he
likes my new idea

29:51.200 --> 29:52.435
before committing
it to the page.

29:52.469 --> 29:54.737
I do not want to be late.

30:07.450 --> 30:08.851
Charles?

30:13.322 --> 30:15.925
And so, you see, Henry,
it's only through the medium

30:15.958 --> 30:17.460
that the killer can
be brought to justice,

30:17.494 --> 30:19.762
based on new evidence that he
gathers from beyond the grave.

30:19.795 --> 30:22.331
I like the premise,
Charles, but not enough

30:22.364 --> 30:24.668
to wait another six
months to see a script.

30:24.700 --> 30:27.236
Charles will deliver
in a few weeks, Daddy.

30:27.269 --> 30:28.505
You have my word.

30:30.105 --> 30:31.441
And mine.

30:31.474 --> 30:33.242
- Cut!
- And we've cut!

30:33.275 --> 30:35.445
Right, come on, let's go and
watch the next scene.

30:35.478 --> 30:38.582
I think Hitch will be the
perfect director for our film.

30:38.615 --> 30:41.283
Just don't get under his feet.

30:41.317 --> 30:43.620
Come on, darling.

30:43.653 --> 30:45.721
<i>Bring Miss Withers
some makeup, please.</i>

30:45.754 --> 30:47.923
<i>Googie, darling,
how lovely to see you.</i>

30:47.957 --> 30:49.426
Charles Condomine.

30:49.459 --> 30:51.428
Ah, I'm a big fan of
your books, Mr. Condomine.

30:51.461 --> 30:53.128
When can we expect
Detective Flowers

30:53.162 --> 30:54.730
to crack his next case?

30:54.763 --> 30:58.033
Ah, Charles has actually made
the leap into screenwriting.

30:58.067 --> 30:59.134
With Daddy's help.

30:59.168 --> 31:00.069
Oh, how exciting.

31:01.504 --> 31:03.673
I'd die to play one of your
strong-willed female characters.

31:03.707 --> 31:06.075
Where do you draw
your inspiration from?

31:06.108 --> 31:07.977
Where do you think?

31:08.010 --> 31:11.180
Oh, how romantic,
to marry your muse.

31:11.213 --> 31:14.817
Not so romantic
to replace her.

31:14.850 --> 31:16.252
Why don't you tell her
the truth, Charles,

31:16.285 --> 31:18.220
that you're an astral bigamist?

31:18.254 --> 31:20.490
Be quiet. Stop
behaving like a harlot.

31:21.658 --> 31:22.659
I beg your pardon?

31:23.627 --> 31:24.960
Admit it, Charles.

31:24.994 --> 31:27.564
All of your female
characters are based on me.

31:27.597 --> 31:30.132
You always were vain
and self-obsessed.

31:30.165 --> 31:32.702
How dare you speak to
my leading lady like that?

31:32.736 --> 31:34.870
No, no no.

31:39.576 --> 31:42.244
Get a grip, Charles.
What on earth is going on?

31:42.278 --> 31:43.112
Elvira is here.

31:45.515 --> 31:46.782
I can see her.

31:46.815 --> 31:48.284
She's right there.

31:48.317 --> 31:51.521
I insist you go home
immediately and lie down.

31:51.554 --> 31:53.255
I have no desire to go to bed

31:53.289 --> 31:54.524
in the middle of the afternoon.

31:54.557 --> 31:56.593
My, how things have changed.

31:56.626 --> 31:58.628
I remember a time
when we could barely

31:58.662 --> 32:00.863
drag ourselves out
of our double divan.

32:00.896 --> 32:03.633
Stop being indecent.
Get out of my sight.

32:03.667 --> 32:06.436
How dare you speak to
my daughter like that!

32:06.469 --> 32:07.537
No, I wasn't speaking to her.

32:07.570 --> 32:09.805
Get off my set.

32:09.838 --> 32:10.640
You're in trouble now.

32:10.674 --> 32:11.741
Don't be so infantile.

32:11.775 --> 32:14.143
I'll give you infantile.

32:14.176 --> 32:15.144
Ooh!

32:15.177 --> 32:16.178
Ooh.

32:16.211 --> 32:17.012
Oww!

32:17.046 --> 32:17.880
Ah.

32:21.718 --> 32:22.985
Does it hurt?

32:24.320 --> 32:25.921
Only if I breathe.

32:25.954 --> 32:27.990
Let me see it, darling.

32:28.023 --> 32:29.325
What about now?

32:29.358 --> 32:30.593
Oh, God!

32:32.161 --> 32:34.263
I suggest you take
yourself to your study.

32:34.296 --> 32:35.565
The only way my father
will forgive you

32:35.598 --> 32:37.767
is if you deliver an
Oscar-worthy script.

32:37.801 --> 32:39.436
How am I supposed to
write in this state?

32:39.469 --> 32:40.869
Well you better try.

32:40.903 --> 32:43.839
Either start typing and
prove you're not barking mad,

32:43.872 --> 32:45.775
or I'll be forced
to call Dr. Bradman

32:45.809 --> 32:48.277
and have you referred
to a nerve specialist.

32:48.310 --> 32:50.714
Ruth, I'm not in
the least neurotic.

32:50.747 --> 32:51.681
And never have been.

32:51.715 --> 32:53.616
Well, psychoanalyst, then.

32:53.650 --> 32:55.184
Ugh.

32:55.217 --> 32:57.721
I refuse to endure months
of expensive humiliation,

32:57.754 --> 32:59.288
only to be told at the end of it

32:59.321 --> 33:01.323
that at the age of four I was
in love with my rocking horse.

33:01.357 --> 33:03.626
Don't take that flippant tone
with me, Charles Condomine.

33:03.660 --> 33:05.695
I'm not the one who
started seeing things.

33:05.729 --> 33:07.029
Ah, so you do believe me then?

33:07.062 --> 33:08.263
Of course I don't.

33:08.297 --> 33:10.265
There's no such thing
as ghosts or ghouls.

33:26.248 --> 33:28.117
I call upon Donald Keeling,

33:29.853 --> 33:31.388
Second Lieutenant

33:32.722 --> 33:36.626
in the 92nd Regiment
of Gordon Highlanders.

33:38.293 --> 33:42.965
Who died on February
the 27th, 1881,

33:45.234 --> 33:47.269
at the Battle of Majuba Hill.

33:49.071 --> 33:49.972
Come forth

33:51.441 --> 33:53.510
and make yourself known to me.

33:55.645 --> 34:00.517
Cecily, your ever devoted wife.

34:07.956 --> 34:11.994
Donald... Is that you?

34:12.027 --> 34:14.664
It's housekeeping.
Do you need fresh towels?

34:34.451 --> 34:36.284
What are you doing here?

34:36.318 --> 34:38.755
Despite removing
every trace of me,

34:38.788 --> 34:40.790
this is still my home.

34:40.824 --> 34:43.091
Besides, I have no
idea how to get back

34:43.125 --> 34:45.428
even if I wanted to.

34:45.462 --> 34:47.062
Are you saying you're
staying indefinitely?

34:47.094 --> 34:48.465
Why?

34:48.498 --> 34:50.299
Would you hate it
so much if I did?

34:51.568 --> 34:54.268
Honestly, Charles, I
really am a little hurt.

34:54.303 --> 34:56.438
You're the only one who
could have called me back.

34:56.473 --> 34:59.074
I most emphatically did
not send for you, Elvira.

35:08.618 --> 35:09.819
Ruth and I are
about to celebrate

35:09.853 --> 35:11.721
our fifth wedding
anniversary together.

35:11.754 --> 35:13.423
Five?

35:13.456 --> 35:14.557
What is that, leather?

35:15.692 --> 35:16.659
Wood.

35:16.693 --> 35:18.193
Watch out for the splinters.

35:22.532 --> 35:23.833
Mrs. Condomine.

35:36.713 --> 35:37.981
I'll call Dr. Bradman, see

35:38.013 --> 35:40.148
if he'll accompany
us to the sanitarium.

35:40.182 --> 35:42.284
Ruth, please, listen to me.

35:42.317 --> 35:43.753
I haven't gone mad.

35:43.786 --> 35:45.955
The ghost of my first wife,
Elvira, has crossed over

35:45.989 --> 35:47.155
from the other side and is here

35:47.189 --> 35:48.357
in the room with us right now.

35:48.391 --> 35:49.859
Yes, dear.

35:49.893 --> 35:52.160
I know. I see her
perfectly well,

35:52.194 --> 35:54.263
along with the zebras
and chimpanzees

35:54.296 --> 35:56.365
hiding under the piano.

35:56.399 --> 35:58.701
Ruth, I have always
looked upon you as a woman

35:58.735 --> 36:01.336
of perception and understanding.

36:01.370 --> 36:02.939
I am, but if you say
you're not drinking,

36:02.972 --> 36:05.742
there must be something
pressing on your brain.

36:06.643 --> 36:07.911
Elvira, do something to reveal

36:07.944 --> 36:09.913
that you really
are here, please.

36:09.946 --> 36:11.614
She's going to
have me committed.

36:13.416 --> 36:16.184
Do you remember when we
first heard our song, Charles?

36:17.520 --> 36:21.691
♪ I'll be loving
you Always, Oooh ♪

36:38.508 --> 36:40.009
See? What did I tell you?

36:40.043 --> 36:41.243
It's a cruel trick, Charles,

36:41.276 --> 36:43.111
using some sort
of auto suggestion

36:43.145 --> 36:45.448
or hypnotism to scare me.

36:45.481 --> 36:47.584
It isn't. I swear
it isn't. Darling.

36:50.620 --> 36:51.921
Darling.

36:51.955 --> 36:53.556
Elvira, do something
else, for God sake.

36:53.590 --> 36:54.891
Oh, anything to oblige.

36:59.829 --> 37:00.597
Look.

37:05.969 --> 37:07.102
Lord.

37:09.839 --> 37:10.540
Ahh!

37:14.844 --> 37:16.579
Adios, interloper.

37:18.481 --> 37:19.482
Oops.

37:25.855 --> 37:27.724
<i>I'm afraid we
need the room back.</i>

37:27.757 --> 37:29.692
I told you I'll
be packed and ready

37:29.726 --> 37:31.728
to go within an hour.

37:46.241 --> 37:49.012
Ah, thank God I caught you.

37:49.045 --> 37:50.847
You are my only hope.

37:50.880 --> 37:52.915
Something terrible
has taken place.

37:52.949 --> 37:55.385
You heard strange
noises in the night?

37:55.418 --> 37:57.319
Boards creaking? Doors slamming?

37:57.352 --> 38:00.222
A subdued moaning
in the passages?

38:00.255 --> 38:02.058
Eh, no, none of those.

38:02.091 --> 38:03.126
Oh.

38:03.158 --> 38:05.561
But, it appears that
after the seance

38:05.595 --> 38:07.930
my husband's first wife, Elvira,

38:07.964 --> 38:12.267
who died seven years
ago, is back among us.

38:12.300 --> 38:18.775
At last. A genuine
materialization.

38:18.808 --> 38:22.177
I knew something stupendous
had happened to me that night.

38:22.210 --> 38:24.514
I felt it in my spinal cortex.

38:24.547 --> 38:28.685
Oh, after all these years
of, of spiritual devotion,

38:28.718 --> 38:32.789
I've finally been
rewarded.

38:32.822 --> 38:35.458
I appreciate the pride
in your achievement,

38:35.491 --> 38:36.759
but I would like to
point out it's making

38:36.793 --> 38:38.661
my position in my
home untenable,

38:38.695 --> 38:41.698
and I hold you
entirely responsible.

38:41.731 --> 38:44.467
Oh, forgive me,
Mrs. Condomine.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.602
I'm being abominably selfish.

38:46.636 --> 38:49.639
Just to help me get
this clear in my mind,

38:49.672 --> 38:53.109
y-you yourself have not
seen this manifestation?

38:53.142 --> 38:58.614
No, but Charles claims
he can see and talk to her.

38:58.648 --> 39:01.249
Well, if the emotional
connection is strong,

39:01.283 --> 39:03.486
that is sometimes possible.

39:03.519 --> 39:05.088
What?

39:05.121 --> 39:08.991
It can sometimes develop

39:09.025 --> 39:11.594
into a level ten,

39:11.627 --> 39:14.097
something I've never
even dared dream of.

39:16.766 --> 39:20.536
Can he, by any
chance, touch her?

39:22.739 --> 39:24.507
I sincerely hope not.

39:26.909 --> 39:28.411
Why?

39:28.444 --> 39:29.912
Can that happen?

39:29.946 --> 39:34.150
Well. if the returning spirit
feels welcome... it can

39:36.018 --> 39:41.557
gradually become
physically... substantial.

39:42.725 --> 39:44.259
Thank you, Mrs. Bradman.

39:44.292 --> 39:46.963
Well, please do let me know
if you hear from her.

39:51.067 --> 39:53.603
She's not there either.

39:53.636 --> 39:55.370
I remember when you
couldn't wait to spend

39:55.404 --> 39:57.607
an afternoon alone with me.

39:57.640 --> 40:00.610
Please refrain from
playing with my affections.

40:00.643 --> 40:01.844
I feel strange enough.

40:01.878 --> 40:03.846
So you do still
find me attractive?

40:03.880 --> 40:05.148
Elvira, please.

40:06.816 --> 40:08.050
This isn't appropriate.

40:09.018 --> 40:10.086
Look into my eyes.

40:13.288 --> 40:15.323
And tell me you don't
love me anymore.

40:18.094 --> 40:19.962
I shall always love
the memory of you.

40:19.996 --> 40:23.199
Memories are about
the past, Charles.

40:23.232 --> 40:24.366
But I'm here.

40:25.367 --> 40:27.136
And this is the present.

40:28.538 --> 40:30.173
Why don't we take the boat out

40:30.206 --> 40:32.608
like we used to
and get some air?

40:35.077 --> 40:37.013
I can't. I'm on a deadline.

40:38.381 --> 40:41.284
What are you writing? Checks?

40:41.316 --> 40:42.518
I'll have you know
I've been commissioned

40:42.552 --> 40:44.453
to adapt my first
novel for the screen.

40:45.521 --> 40:46.856
Your first novel?

40:48.858 --> 40:50.259
Nearly wore my
fingers to the bone

40:50.293 --> 40:52.195
committing this
story to the page.

40:52.228 --> 40:53.696
Let's face it, darling.

40:53.729 --> 40:55.498
It's not a coincidence
that you haven't published

40:55.531 --> 40:58.835
a word since my demise.

40:58.868 --> 41:01.571
I won't deny, you did have
a certain flair for plot.

41:01.604 --> 41:02.772
Mm-hmm.

41:02.805 --> 41:03.606
And character.

41:03.639 --> 41:05.007
And?

41:06.142 --> 41:07.109
And dialogue.

41:07.143 --> 41:08.177
Right.

41:13.616 --> 41:15.017
The biggest problem
you have is the twist

41:15.051 --> 41:16.185
into the third act.

41:16.219 --> 41:17.553
It isn't dramatic
enough, which is why you

41:17.587 --> 41:20.022
don't have a satisfying climax.

41:20.056 --> 41:21.424
Tell me something
I don't know.

41:21.457 --> 41:22.992
Wouldn't it be smarter
to put the whole thing

41:23.025 --> 41:25.494
on its head and reveal
the husband as the killer?

41:26.596 --> 41:27.763
Oh that's good.

41:27.797 --> 41:29.866
Or, what would
be more interesting

41:29.899 --> 41:31.667
is if it's the wife
who set him up.

41:33.569 --> 41:35.771
Why would the wife send
her husband to the gallows?

41:35.805 --> 41:37.039
It's obvious, darling.

41:37.073 --> 41:39.141
Susan Rutherford becomes
the prime suspect

41:39.175 --> 41:41.777
when her alibi fails to
materialize, and we naturally

41:41.811 --> 41:44.280
assume that she's trying
to protect the reputation

41:44.313 --> 41:46.215
of the foreign secretary,
whose aspirations

41:46.249 --> 41:48.918
of becoming the prime minister
would be severely compromised

41:48.951 --> 41:52.788
if it was revealed that
he was having an affair.

41:52.822 --> 41:55.858
But, in reality, nothing could
be further from the truth,

41:55.892 --> 41:58.127
which is what we learn
from the victim himself.

41:58.160 --> 42:00.863
And it's only through the medium
that they can work it out.

42:02.064 --> 42:03.165
Work what out?

42:03.199 --> 42:04.166
That she's pregnant
with the dead

42:04.200 --> 42:05.234
foreign secretary's child.

42:07.536 --> 42:09.205
Oh, that's good.

42:09.238 --> 42:10.506
Mm.

42:10.539 --> 42:13.709
Well even I
didn't see that one coming.

42:13.743 --> 42:15.011
Of course you didn't, darling.

42:15.044 --> 42:16.178
You're just the writer.

42:19.048 --> 42:22.285
I'm afraid, Mrs.
Condomine, the time has come

42:22.318 --> 42:24.520
for me to admit quite frankly,

42:24.553 --> 42:27.423
I haven't the foggiest
idea how to send her back.

42:28.824 --> 42:31.093
I have my own personal
reasons for wishing

42:31.127 --> 42:33.629
to communicate
with the departed,

42:33.663 --> 42:36.265
but I never for a moment
considered the possibility

42:36.299 --> 42:38.467
of having to send someone back.

42:38.501 --> 42:41.470
Well I suggest
that you find a way.

42:41.504 --> 42:44.473
I refuse to share my
husband with anyone,

42:44.507 --> 42:46.842
especially his dead ex-wife.

42:46.876 --> 42:49.045
Well if I thought for a
moment that your husband

42:49.078 --> 42:51.480
wished to get in
touch with the spirit

42:51.514 --> 42:53.816
of his dead ex-wife,
I would have of course

42:53.849 --> 42:55.051
consulted you first.

42:55.084 --> 42:57.053
After all, <i>noblesse oblige</i>.

42:57.086 --> 42:58.955
He had no intention of
getting in touch with her.

42:58.988 --> 43:00.156
I can assure you.

43:00.189 --> 43:01.490
The whole thing was
planned in order

43:01.524 --> 43:04.560
to get material for
his new project.

43:04.593 --> 43:08.364
Am I to understand I was
invited in the spirit of mockery?

43:08.398 --> 43:09.999
He merely wanted
to make some notes

43:10.032 --> 43:11.734
of the tricks of the trade.

43:11.767 --> 43:13.035
Tricks of the trade?

43:13.069 --> 43:15.439
I've never been so
insulted in my life.

43:15.471 --> 43:17.073
I'm sorry, that
all came out wrong.

43:17.106 --> 43:19.608
I'm, I'm rather overwrought
with the whole affair.

43:21.811 --> 43:23.813
Please, I implore
you to help us.

43:25.781 --> 43:27.650
I will go to the
Spiritual Alliance

43:27.683 --> 43:31.320
on my way back to Sussex
and ask them for guidance.

43:31.354 --> 43:36.158
Sussex? You can't abandon
us in our hour of need.

43:36.192 --> 43:37.927
Well, due to my
recent circumstances,

43:37.960 --> 43:40.229
I can no longer
afford to stay here,

43:40.262 --> 43:41.431
but you can contact me.

43:43.232 --> 43:46.302
I can cover your hotel
bill, and any expenses,

43:46.335 --> 43:49.171
till this terrifying
ordeal has been resolved.

43:56.078 --> 43:57.313
<i>Susan
Rutherford leans</i>

43:57.346 --> 43:58.681
<i>over the foreign secretary.</i>

43:59.682 --> 44:01.517
Don't stop.

44:01.550 --> 44:06.255
'The Soviet Union can wait.'
Says the foreign secretary.

44:06.288 --> 44:10.192
He turns, and looks
at Susan longingly.

44:10.226 --> 44:13.529
'This can't, ' he
whispers urgently.

44:15.965 --> 44:19.368
And then... he starts to slowly

44:21.037 --> 44:21.871
unbutton

44:22.972 --> 44:25.141
her silk blouse,

44:25.174 --> 44:29.912
as they start to
passionately kiss.

44:32.715 --> 44:35.684
Okay. That takes us up
to the first act turn.

44:38.287 --> 44:40.356
You can't just stop mid-flow.

44:40.390 --> 44:43.259
I'm tired, and I'm thirsty,

44:43.292 --> 44:45.561
and I want to go into
town and drink Negronis

44:45.594 --> 44:47.497
like we used to.

44:47.531 --> 44:49.899
But it's, it's getting late.

44:49.932 --> 44:51.634
You really have got a
little too comfortable

44:51.667 --> 44:52.968
in your slippers, Charles.

- Hmm.

45:27.269 --> 45:29.705
I don't know what you mean.

45:29.738 --> 45:31.774
I remember whenever you
were overwhelmingly demure,

45:31.807 --> 45:34.110
it usually meant that
you wanted something.

45:34.143 --> 45:37.680
It's horrid of you
to be so suspicious.

45:37.713 --> 45:41.317
All I want is to
be alone with you.

45:41.350 --> 45:44.053
I can't deny, I do feel rather
peculiar seeing you again.

45:46.655 --> 45:49.024
I've missed you
more than life itself.

45:51.093 --> 45:52.194
I've missed you too.

45:54.063 --> 45:55.331
My American dream.

46:00.102 --> 46:03.339
I was utterly heartbroken
after the accident.

46:08.478 --> 46:09.613
The truth is, I
don't believe I ever

46:09.645 --> 46:10.980
really got over losing you.

46:14.584 --> 46:15.684
Do you love Ruth?

46:17.454 --> 46:18.320
Of course I do.

46:20.689 --> 46:22.291
As much as you loved me?

46:24.326 --> 46:25.761
Don't be silly.

46:28.565 --> 46:30.567
It's entirely different.

46:33.002 --> 46:35.572
I'm so glad.

46:35.605 --> 46:38.040
Nothing could have ever been
quite the same, could it?

46:46.081 --> 46:47.517
Let's go to SoHo.

I'm gonna be sick.

Oh, God.

47:28.857 --> 47:29.892
Charles!

47:33.896 --> 47:36.700
I love being back
behind the wheel of a car.

47:36.732 --> 47:38.801
Can't say the
feeling's mutual.

47:38.834 --> 47:40.470
Charles?

47:40.503 --> 47:42.505
Where on earth have you
been? I've been worried sick.

47:42.539 --> 47:45.040
It's too bad
it's not terminal.

47:45.074 --> 47:48.545
I wanted to clear my head,
so I took a long drive.

47:48.578 --> 47:50.513
In the passenger seat?

47:50.547 --> 47:54.149
Look, let's not quarrel
when we should be celebrating.

47:54.183 --> 47:55.985
I finished the first
act of my screenplay,

47:56.018 --> 47:58.187
and it's rather good.

47:58.220 --> 48:00.356
My screenplay more like.

48:00.390 --> 48:02.124
How did you manage
that in a day?

48:04.226 --> 48:05.629
Elvira helped me.

48:05.662 --> 48:08.130
Do you mean to tell me
that not only has she bullied

48:08.163 --> 48:10.132
her way back over the threshold,

48:10.165 --> 48:12.935
she's trying to work
with you now as well?

48:12.968 --> 48:14.136
What do you mean trying?

48:14.169 --> 48:15.639
I've written 15
books in your name.

48:15.672 --> 48:18.207
Elvira, this is neither
the time nor the place.

48:18.240 --> 48:20.809
Oh, this is intolerable.

48:20.843 --> 48:23.912
Elvira, now you listen to me.

48:23.946 --> 48:24.714
Darling?

48:24.748 --> 48:25.548
I... Yes?

48:25.582 --> 48:27.016
She's over there.

48:27.049 --> 48:27.883
Right.

48:31.954 --> 48:33.623
Now listen here, Elvira.

48:33.657 --> 48:35.425
I've been to see Madame Arcati.

48:35.458 --> 48:36.992
She's going to send you back

48:37.026 --> 48:39.962
to wherever it is she
regrettably dragged you from.

48:41.096 --> 48:41.930
Charles?

48:42.732 --> 48:43.566
Charles?

48:45.635 --> 48:46.969
Don't.

49:00.550 --> 49:02.818
Darling, please don't be upset.

49:02.851 --> 49:05.655
Upset? You've just spent
the night with your ex-wife.

49:05.689 --> 49:07.923
How do you expect me to feel?

49:07.956 --> 49:09.258
Ecstatic.

49:09.291 --> 49:10.627
Oooh.

49:10.660 --> 49:14.930
Our dream of going to Hollywood
is finally within our grasp.

49:14.963 --> 49:16.165
As soon as I deliver
this screenplay,

49:16.198 --> 49:17.434
we'll be crossing the Atlantic

49:17.467 --> 49:19.669
quicker than you can
say Sunset Boulevard.

49:21.904 --> 49:24.940
Think of the glitz.
The glamour.

49:26.308 --> 49:29.078
The good times
we're gonna share.

49:29.111 --> 49:32.014
You won't be reading about
other people's lives anymore.

49:32.047 --> 49:33.483
They'll be reading about ours.

49:44.561 --> 49:47.397
And you can't
do it without her?

49:48.565 --> 49:50.533
Of course I can.

49:50.567 --> 49:52.167
It'll just be a lot
quicker this way.

49:55.070 --> 49:57.306
There's really no need
for you to be jealous.

49:58.775 --> 50:01.845
You're the one I love.

50:01.877 --> 50:04.079
Forgive me that I
don't tell you enough.

50:07.650 --> 50:09.419
Now that the words are flowing,

50:09.452 --> 50:12.888
I feel unblocked
in other areas too.

50:19.161 --> 50:21.330
Promise me you
can't touch her.

50:23.800 --> 50:26.870
Darling, she's a ghost.

50:29.304 --> 50:31.875
And besides, the only woman
I want to touch is you.

51:13.750 --> 51:16.419
Listen here, lady.

51:16.453 --> 51:19.021
You may have summoned
me into this world,

51:19.054 --> 51:22.826
but there's no way I'm going
to let you send me back again.

51:24.494 --> 51:25.929
I'm here to stay.

51:26.896 --> 51:27.730
Is that clear?

51:49.853 --> 51:50.653
Oh.

51:51.454 --> 51:52.455
Mm.

51:53.355 --> 51:54.156
Hmm.

52:02.599 --> 52:06.235
How dare you ignore me,
you meddling old crone?

52:06.268 --> 52:09.439
Either you leave me in
your peace to live my life,

52:09.472 --> 52:12.040
or I'll haunt you
until the day you die.

52:24.119 --> 52:26.689
The Tower. Symbol of chaos,

52:28.290 --> 52:29.191
destruction

52:30.827 --> 52:31.961
and devastation.

52:45.875 --> 52:46.843
Wakey-wakey.

52:47.677 --> 52:49.111
Rise and shine.

52:50.914 --> 52:53.683
What was I, Charles?
The warm-up act?

52:57.787 --> 52:59.856
If I was you, I'd keep it there.

53:04.259 --> 53:05.728
Good afternoon, ma'am.

53:05.762 --> 53:07.864
I'm going to have
to correct you, Edith.

53:07.897 --> 53:10.633
It's not a good afternoon.
It's a glorious one.

53:12.234 --> 53:13.870
Shall I prepare lunch?

53:13.903 --> 53:15.337
Ah, yes please.
You read my mind.

53:15.370 --> 53:16.873
I'm absolutely famished.

53:16.906 --> 53:20.108
I'd like a cheese and pickle
platter. With extra pickle.

53:21.811 --> 53:22.912
Yes, ma'am.

53:24.013 --> 53:24.681
Oh.

53:26.416 --> 53:28.317
What happened to your leg?

53:28.350 --> 53:29.852
Oh, I slipped
down the staircase.

53:29.886 --> 53:31.387
You really must
refrain from doing

53:31.421 --> 53:32.622
everything at the double.

53:32.655 --> 53:34.156
You're not in the
navy, you know.

53:34.189 --> 53:35.625
I wasn't hurrying, ma'am.

53:35.658 --> 53:38.260
There was axle grease smeared
all over the top step.

53:44.934 --> 53:46.769
<i>Yes, her
agent loves the pitch,</i>

53:46.803 --> 53:49.338
<i>thinks it would be a
perfect vehicle for her.</i>

53:49.371 --> 53:50.740
Seriously? Greta Garbo?

53:50.773 --> 53:52.775
<i>Yes.</i>

53:52.809 --> 53:55.110
Mata Hari speaking my words
would be a dream come true.

53:55.143 --> 53:57.480
<i>Charles, are
you still on track?</i>

53:57.513 --> 53:58.948
Yes, absolutely
still on track.

53:58.982 --> 54:00.148
I'll send the next ream of pages

54:00.182 --> 54:01.784
over as I reach the
second act turn.

54:01.818 --> 54:03.019
<i>Don't let me down.</i>

54:03.052 --> 54:05.021
Thank you, Henry.
And I appreciate your

54:05.054 --> 54:06.789
continued patience and belief.

54:06.823 --> 54:07.490
<i>Splendid.</i>

54:07.523 --> 54:08.223
Goodbye, g...

54:57.740 --> 54:59.207
Elvira, what are you doing?

54:59.241 --> 55:01.577
Greta Garbo speaking my words?

55:01.611 --> 55:03.012
Darling, what am
I supposed to say?

55:03.046 --> 55:05.548
That I've got a ghostwriter?

55:06.549 --> 55:07.717
Stop it.

55:07.750 --> 55:09.118
Elvira, that's one
of our wedding gifts.

55:09.152 --> 55:11.454
Not ours, Charles, Hers.

55:15.758 --> 55:17.225
You care more about
breaking china

55:17.259 --> 55:19.162
than you do about
breaking my heart.

55:23.733 --> 55:26.669
Elvira, I was unwaveringly
loyal and faithful

55:26.703 --> 55:28.905
to you in all our
years of marriage.

55:28.938 --> 55:30.907
What was I supposed
to do after you died?

55:30.940 --> 55:33.308
Become a recluse and
wear a black armband

55:33.341 --> 55:34.544
for the rest of my life?

55:38.147 --> 55:40.383
Ma'am, the garden
judges are here.

55:41.283 --> 55:42.350
Ah.

55:42.385 --> 55:43.218
Thank you, Edith.

55:55.098 --> 55:57.700
Oh, we've been sabotaged.

56:15.985 --> 56:18.721
Oh, that is an
outrageous suggestion.

56:18.755 --> 56:21.057
As the national director
of the Spiritual Alliance,

56:21.090 --> 56:22.759
my job is to protect
the reputation

56:22.792 --> 56:25.161
of genuine psychic practitioners,
not undermine them.

56:25.194 --> 56:26.429
<i>I see.</i>

56:26.462 --> 56:29.499
And I vow, along with
my friend Harry Houdini,

56:29.532 --> 56:33.368
to investigate and expose
every fraudulent spiritualist

56:33.402 --> 56:34.570
operating in this country.

56:34.604 --> 56:35.538
<i>Very good sir.</i>

56:36.371 --> 56:37.540
Come in.

56:38.775 --> 56:40.342
Madame Arcati here
to see you, sir.

56:40.375 --> 56:41.376
<i>Thank you very
much for your time, sir.</i>

56:41.410 --> 56:43.813
Yes... well no-no-no,
thank you.

56:43.846 --> 56:44.847
<i>Thank you.</i>

56:44.881 --> 56:46.382
Always a pleasure to
talk to the press.

56:46.415 --> 56:47.784
<i>Goodbye, sir.</i>

56:47.817 --> 56:48.951
Well you've got a cheek,

56:48.985 --> 56:51.788
showing your face
while you're suspended.

56:51.821 --> 56:53.523
I'm sorry to turn
up unannounced,

56:53.556 --> 56:56.559
but I urgently
need your guidance.

56:56.592 --> 57:00.730
I have pulled off a
level-ten manifestation.

57:02.231 --> 57:04.200
And was this before
or after you conned

57:04.233 --> 57:06.402
800 people into paying
to see you levitate?

57:06.435 --> 57:08.070
No, really, you must
believe me, Harry.

57:08.104 --> 57:12.008
And it is possible this
presence has a physical form.

57:14.644 --> 57:16.245
Margot, where
are the scissors?

57:16.279 --> 57:18.514
Drawer.

57:18.548 --> 57:21.918
So you're telling me that the
first level-ten manifestation

57:21.951 --> 57:25.454
reported in over three
centuries was the result

57:25.488 --> 57:27.256
of an ordinary
common-or-garden seance.

57:27.290 --> 57:28.524
Yes, that is correct.

57:30.293 --> 57:32.428
What did you use as a guide?

57:32.461 --> 57:36.799
Oh, um, this. <i>The</i>
<i>Art of the Seance.</i>

57:36.833 --> 57:37.633
Ohh.

57:40.203 --> 57:41.404
Can you help me?

57:41.437 --> 57:43.439
Yes, Madame Arcati,
yes, I think I can.

57:43.472 --> 57:45.842
Do you have your
membership card?

57:45.875 --> 57:47.310
Membership card, eh...

57:50.046 --> 57:51.814
Yes.

57:51.848 --> 57:53.049
I'm going to start
by terminating

57:53.082 --> 57:55.284
your membership with
immediate effect.

57:55.318 --> 57:59.856
This is no place for
fantasists or frauds.

57:59.889 --> 58:02.992
Margot. Madame
Arcati's leaving now.

58:12.802 --> 58:15.972
Meet me at Temple
Square in an hour.

58:29.385 --> 58:31.888
Chapter four,
page nine, paragraph six.

58:37.026 --> 58:39.262
A banishing spell.

58:39.295 --> 58:42.131
Oh, Margot, thank you.

58:42.164 --> 58:43.566
We don't have long.

58:43.599 --> 58:44.800
I need to replace it in the safe

58:44.834 --> 58:46.802
before Mr. Price
returns from lunch.

58:46.836 --> 58:50.406
It's recorded in
ancient Druidic text.

58:50.439 --> 58:52.675
I'm a little rusty,
but I'll do my best.

58:52.708 --> 58:54.911
Oh, oh wait.

59:02.318 --> 59:05.955
Take Ceridwens's
brew of Devil's Claw.

59:06.956 --> 59:07.857
Devil's Claw.

59:07.890 --> 59:10.526
Poisoned root of Aconite.

59:10.559 --> 59:11.994
Oh, yes.

59:12.028 --> 59:14.430
Elixir of Vervain flowers.

59:14.463 --> 59:17.600
Verr..Oh, yes, of course,
that's the enchanter's plant.

59:25.074 --> 59:28.110
The sacrificial offering
is at its strongest

59:28.144 --> 59:29.312
with a waning moon.

59:29.345 --> 59:31.948
A waning moon.

59:31.981 --> 59:34.083
Sprinkle black salt
on a stone altar.

59:35.251 --> 59:36.452
Salt.

59:36.485 --> 59:39.855
Then lay the freshly torn
bladder of a carnivore.

59:39.889 --> 59:41.157
The bl-bladder?

59:43.225 --> 59:45.127
Oh, no.

59:45.161 --> 59:47.563
Freshly torn bladderwort.

59:47.596 --> 59:48.798
Oh.

59:48.831 --> 59:52.268
Of the carnivorous aquatic
Utricularia plant family.

59:52.301 --> 59:53.769
Oh, thank heaven.

59:53.803 --> 59:56.138
I thought for a minute I was going
to have to get my hands dirty.

01:00:00.444 --> 01:00:02.712
<i>Au revoir</i>, Madame Arcati.

01:00:04.246 --> 01:00:05.081
Good luck.

01:00:12.788 --> 01:00:14.523
Will you excuse me?

01:00:16.225 --> 01:00:17.394
What about Clark Gable?

01:00:17.427 --> 01:00:19.996
He'd make a dashing
Detective Frank Flowers.

01:00:20.029 --> 01:00:22.064
Good actor, terrible breath.

01:00:22.098 --> 01:00:23.032
Oh.

01:00:23.065 --> 01:00:24.300
Very tricky for
the leading ladies.

01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:25.735
I was thinking Cary Grant.

01:00:25.768 --> 01:00:27.404
Now we're talking.

01:00:27.437 --> 01:00:29.839
I look forward to making his
acquaintance at the premiere.

01:00:29.872 --> 01:00:31.007
Well I'm afraid
you're getting ahead

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.341
of yourself there, Mrs. Bradman.

01:00:32.375 --> 01:00:35.111
Even I can't make a
film without a script.

01:00:35.144 --> 01:00:37.813
Be rather like trying to perform
surgery without a patient.

01:00:39.115 --> 01:00:40.850
The typewriter can be a
cruel and demanding mistress.

01:00:40.883 --> 01:00:42.118
Yes, well, let's hope that's

01:00:42.151 --> 01:00:44.320
the only affair
Charles is having.

01:00:49.959 --> 01:00:51.495
Hello, Daddy.

01:00:51.527 --> 01:00:53.362
Time for a speech.

01:00:53.397 --> 01:00:54.464
Ah.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.137
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:01:02.605 --> 01:01:04.907
Ha-ha. Oh.

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.276
As a writer, people
are always expecting me

01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:09.446
to come up with lots of words.

01:01:09.479 --> 01:01:11.013
Hm.

01:01:11.047 --> 01:01:13.049
Well, today I'm sure you'll
all be relieved to hear

01:01:13.082 --> 01:01:15.951
that I'm going to keep
things short and sweet.

01:01:15.985 --> 01:01:17.186
Just like my wife.

01:01:18.988 --> 01:01:21.624
If I were to create a
character as beautiful,

01:01:21.657 --> 01:01:24.960
as poised, as perfect as Ruth,

01:01:24.994 --> 01:01:28.297
my fans would accuse me
of straying into fantasy.

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:29.399
Oh.

01:01:29.433 --> 01:01:31.033
But thankfully we
are all here today

01:01:31.067 --> 01:01:33.969
to celebrate the fact
that Ruth is my reality,

01:01:34.003 --> 01:01:38.240
and has been for
five fabulous years.

01:01:38.274 --> 01:01:41.077
So, let us be
upstanding, upstandingly,

01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:44.914
and raise our
glasses to true love.

01:01:44.947 --> 01:01:47.950
- True love.
- True love.

01:01:47.983 --> 01:01:49.118
True love.

01:01:50.319 --> 01:01:51.353
Never dies.

Ruth, what on earth
are you doing?

01:02:28.324 --> 01:02:29.658
Cooling off.

01:02:29.692 --> 01:02:32.294
All that dancing got
me hot and sticky!

01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:36.198
Everybody's looking.

01:02:36.232 --> 01:02:39.168
I didn't know it was going
to be one of those parties.

01:02:39.201 --> 01:02:40.903
You're as wet as
an otter's pocket.

01:02:40.936 --> 01:02:42.238
What happened to your dress?

01:02:42.271 --> 01:02:44.707
Well what happened
to yours, Daddy?

01:02:45.841 --> 01:02:46.909
Everybody!

01:02:46.942 --> 01:02:48.110
Yes, that's lovely, darling.

01:02:48.144 --> 01:02:49.579
I'm not sure the fish
are enjoying this.

01:02:49.613 --> 01:02:52.314
Why don't you come upstairs
and have a little lie-down, hm?

01:02:52.348 --> 01:02:54.016
Only if you're
going to join me.

01:02:59.389 --> 01:03:02.559
Oh, make love to me like
it was the first time.

01:03:04.628 --> 01:03:05.995
Whee!

01:03:06.028 --> 01:03:08.632
Does Mr. Peasbody want
to come out and play?.

01:03:09.732 --> 01:03:10.567
Oh!

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:11.967
Ah.

01:03:13.436 --> 01:03:14.803
Well, I'm not
surprised she doesn't

01:03:14.837 --> 01:03:16.772
like to do it with
the lights on.

01:03:16.805 --> 01:03:17.873
Don't be so vulgar, Elvira.

01:03:18.741 --> 01:03:19.576
She's in here?!

01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:23.746
Now you listen to me,
you low-rent hussy.

01:03:23.779 --> 01:03:26.650
This is my party, my bedroom,

01:03:26.682 --> 01:03:29.985
my house, and Charles
is my husband.

01:03:31.687 --> 01:03:32.788
What did she say?

01:03:32.821 --> 01:03:34.023
She apologized unreservedly

01:03:34.056 --> 01:03:36.025
and has taken herself
back downstairs.

01:03:36.058 --> 01:03:37.026
Oh.

01:03:37.059 --> 01:03:38.160
You should have been
an actor, Charles.

01:03:38.194 --> 01:03:39.496
You really are rather good.

01:03:41.096 --> 01:03:42.331
I'm sorry, Charles.

01:03:42.364 --> 01:03:45.267
I'm just... I'm not
in the mood anymore.

01:03:49.138 --> 01:03:49.972
I am.

01:03:50.973 --> 01:03:51.807
Oh.

01:04:09.758 --> 01:04:10.926
Morning, darling.

01:04:12.596 --> 01:04:14.263
You look shattered.

01:04:14.296 --> 01:04:17.366
Yes, had a bit
of a restless night.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.635
Yes.

01:04:18.668 --> 01:04:20.670
Yes, I thought you were
thrashing around a bit.

01:04:23.272 --> 01:04:25.874
I had Edna prepare Norfolk
kippers, your favorite.

01:04:25.908 --> 01:04:27.677
Hm, that's very sweet.

01:04:27.711 --> 01:04:29.679
I could do with
something hearty.

01:04:29.713 --> 01:04:33.916
I fear I rather overdid
on the bubbles yesterday.

01:04:33.949 --> 01:04:36.553
The party went by in
a bit of a blur.

01:04:38.254 --> 01:04:39.054
Hm.

01:04:39.855 --> 01:04:41.056
What are you stuck on?

01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:43.460
22 down. Greek
god of retribution.

01:04:43.493 --> 01:04:46.328
Seven letters. Third
letter M, seventh letter S.

01:04:49.298 --> 01:04:50.332
Oh, Nemesis.

01:04:51.534 --> 01:04:52.368
Hmm.

01:05:04.614 --> 01:05:05.749
Ah!

01:05:16.225 --> 01:05:18.395
What on Earth has happened?

01:05:18.428 --> 01:05:21.030
She said the place is cursed.

01:05:23.633 --> 01:05:25.334
Not safe!
Not safe at all!

01:05:25.367 --> 01:05:26.670
Edna? Ah.

01:05:27.903 --> 01:05:28.772
You can't leave us!

01:05:28.804 --> 01:05:30.005
You can keep your job.

01:05:30.039 --> 01:05:31.574
No, I'm getting out of here.

01:05:31.608 --> 01:05:32.374
Go away!

01:05:33.543 --> 01:05:34.910
I'm having nothing to do with
you, Go away!

01:05:34.943 --> 01:05:36.546
Stay Edna. Please.

01:05:36.579 --> 01:05:39.014
You stick your bleeding
job up your bum!

01:05:53.262 --> 01:05:54.930
Ah, there you are.

01:05:55.898 --> 01:05:57.066
There you are.

01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.402
Now, to work.

01:06:04.973 --> 01:06:05.974
Yes.

01:06:18.153 --> 01:06:18.987
Hmm.

01:06:19.656 --> 01:06:20.590
Where are you?

01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:23.827
- Detective,
I don't see how you can blame a girl

01:06:23.859 --> 01:06:26.228
for falling in love
with the right guy

01:06:26.261 --> 01:06:27.863
for the wrong reasons.

01:06:27.896 --> 01:06:31.133
But what about
that poor sap of a husband of yours?

01:06:31.166 --> 01:06:32.535
Guys like him are
a dime a dozen.

01:06:32.569 --> 01:06:34.269
What was he, the right
guy at the wrong place

01:06:34.303 --> 01:06:35.638
at the wrong time?

01:06:35.672 --> 01:06:39.476
- Oh, Detective,
just being close to you,

01:06:39.509 --> 01:06:43.312
I feel as if I am
completely naked.

01:06:43.345 --> 01:06:46.014
How do you always manage
to see right through me?

01:06:48.083 --> 01:06:51.053
I see
things just the way they are.

01:06:51.086 --> 01:06:53.390
The rest of the
world needs bifocals.

01:06:56.826 --> 01:06:57.861
I'm not sure about
that last line.

01:06:57.893 --> 01:07:00.397
It feels too, florid.

01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:03.265
Need something simple
and to the point,

01:07:03.298 --> 01:07:08.303
like... 'That's my job,
sweetie. I just do it.'

01:07:10.607 --> 01:07:12.675
Ha.

01:07:12.709 --> 01:07:15.377
Whatever you prefer. It's
your name on the script.

01:07:19.482 --> 01:07:22.485
And fade to black.

01:07:24.153 --> 01:07:25.187
Mm.

01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.089
Well, dare I say,

01:07:27.122 --> 01:07:29.592
I think the film's gonna be
even better than the book.

01:07:29.626 --> 01:07:31.528
And we finished ahead
of the deadline.

01:07:32.662 --> 01:07:34.464
Just wait till I tell Ruth.

01:07:34.497 --> 01:07:35.297
Mmm.

01:07:39.402 --> 01:07:41.438
Let's not tell her just yet.

01:07:48.143 --> 01:07:50.145
Oh, for heaven's sake.

01:07:51.346 --> 01:07:52.482
Fiddlesticks.

01:07:52.515 --> 01:07:54.216
Oh. Ah!

01:07:56.486 --> 01:07:58.086
Damn and blast.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.456
Oh, you alright, darling?

01:07:59.489 --> 01:08:01.056
Knowing you're working fingers
to the bone makes it easier

01:08:01.089 --> 01:08:03.526
for me to enjoy a few
blisters and burns.

01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:09.198
Out of suffering have emerged

01:08:09.231 --> 01:08:10.934
the strongest souls, my dear.

01:08:13.035 --> 01:08:15.070
I've nothing to serve
for lunch, I'm afraid.

01:08:15.103 --> 01:08:16.238
Oh, please don't
worry about it.

01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:18.441
I'm not in the least hungry.

01:08:18.475 --> 01:08:20.309
Dare I ask how it's
going over there?

01:08:22.109 --> 01:08:24.345
The finishing line
is almost in sight.

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:25.782
Oh, thank goodness.

01:08:25.814 --> 01:08:28.618
I don't like you alone
with her one iota,

01:08:28.651 --> 01:08:30.553
but if it means
you're going to be able

01:08:30.587 --> 01:08:31.888
to deliver the damn script,

01:08:31.921 --> 01:08:33.790
then I can just
about tolerate it.

01:08:35.357 --> 01:08:37.393
You and I do make
a good team, darling.

01:08:37.426 --> 01:08:38.260
Hm.

01:08:42.029 --> 01:08:45.033
I'd like us to move our beds
back together.

01:08:45.067 --> 01:08:46.268
Permanently.

01:08:47.837 --> 01:08:51.541
I think if we're going to be
separated during the days,

01:08:51.573 --> 01:08:54.076
the least we could do is
spend our nights together

01:08:54.109 --> 01:08:55.944
as, as man and wife.

01:08:58.180 --> 01:08:59.649
I should like nothing more.

01:09:02.752 --> 01:09:04.420
I'm going to take a walk.

01:09:05.488 --> 01:09:06.723
Try to clear my head.

01:09:16.899 --> 01:09:19.602
Remember when we used to
play hide-and-seek along here?

01:09:19.636 --> 01:09:22.639
And your reward when
you found me?

01:09:28.377 --> 01:09:29.845
Look. Isn't he handsome?

01:09:32.046 --> 01:09:33.649
He's magnificent.

01:09:35.618 --> 01:09:38.287
He can sense me.

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:40.823
How wonderful not be
frightened of the unknown.

01:09:44.527 --> 01:09:46.796
You're not frightened,
are you, Charles?

01:09:47.897 --> 01:09:49.465
Of what?

01:09:49.499 --> 01:09:51.434
Falling back in love.

01:09:53.368 --> 01:09:55.270
How is that possible
when we're existing

01:09:55.304 --> 01:09:56.839
on two different planes?

01:09:58.073 --> 01:09:59.074
I'm alive, and you're...

01:09:59.107 --> 01:10:01.276
Don't. Don't say it.

01:10:04.547 --> 01:10:07.684
I'm so sorry, Elvira, there's
no easy way to say this.

01:10:11.086 --> 01:10:14.490
But I'm struggling to
see a future in us.

01:10:28.404 --> 01:10:31.774
You know, Charles, when you
give someone an eternity ring,

01:10:31.808 --> 01:10:34.343
it's supposed to be a
love that lasts forever.

01:10:36.779 --> 01:10:37.914
Charles?

01:11:14.917 --> 01:11:16.653
Charles, watch out!

01:11:19.489 --> 01:11:20.322
Damn.

01:11:24.494 --> 01:11:26.562
She's dangerous, Charles.

01:11:26.596 --> 01:11:28.865
Edna was almost scalped.

01:11:28.898 --> 01:11:30.500
And look what happened to Edith.

01:11:30.533 --> 01:11:32.568
What are you suggesting?

01:11:32.602 --> 01:11:35.405
It's blindingly obvious
that Elvira came here

01:11:35.438 --> 01:11:38.107
for one purpose and
one purpose only.

01:11:38.141 --> 01:11:40.877
She came here to have
you to herself, forever.

01:11:42.078 --> 01:11:43.913
Ow! How?

01:11:43.946 --> 01:11:45.815
By killing you off, of course.

01:11:45.848 --> 01:11:47.116
That's absurd.

01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:48.718
Do you really think
the cabinet climbed up

01:11:48.751 --> 01:11:50.987
onto the roof and jumped
off of its own accord?

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:53.690
Elvira might be prone
to temper tantrums,

01:11:53.723 --> 01:11:55.458
but she still loves me.

01:11:55.491 --> 01:11:57.727
She'd never wish me any harm.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.028
Ah.

01:11:59.062 --> 01:12:02.065
If you were dead, it would
be her final triumph over me.

01:12:02.098 --> 01:12:04.634
She'd have you all to herself
on her beastly astral plane,

01:12:04.667 --> 01:12:06.402
and I'd be left high and dry.

01:12:06.436 --> 01:12:09.772
She's probably planning some
sort of spiritual remarriage.

01:12:14.376 --> 01:12:16.112
What are we gonna do?

01:12:16.145 --> 01:12:21.084
Yes, the guest's name
is Madame Arcati, room 14.

01:12:21.117 --> 01:12:22.719
<i>One moment.</i>

01:12:22.752 --> 01:12:23.953
<i>I'm sorry, but she
left yesterday.</i>

01:12:23.986 --> 01:12:26.522
Oh dear. Did she
leave any messages?

01:12:26.556 --> 01:12:28.057
<i>I'm afraid not.</i>

01:12:28.091 --> 01:12:28.891
Thank you.

01:12:30.193 --> 01:12:31.928
She checked out yesterday.

01:12:34.997 --> 01:12:36.165
Well, there's nothing for it.

01:12:36.199 --> 01:12:37.767
I shall have to get
myself arrested.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.267
Spend the night locked
up in the cells.

01:12:39.301 --> 01:12:41.804
No. We just have
to create our own

01:12:41.838 --> 01:12:43.305
safe place for the night.

01:12:44.272 --> 01:12:45.074
Right.

01:12:47.777 --> 01:12:49.545
Now, gently does it.

01:12:50.713 --> 01:12:51.714
Oh.

01:12:56.052 --> 01:12:57.887
Oh, precious.

01:12:59.655 --> 01:13:00.423
Herba veneris.

01:13:01.924 --> 01:13:04.427
Nature's divine protector.

01:13:16.973 --> 01:13:17.874
What are you doing with that?

01:13:17.907 --> 01:13:19.041
I've just removed all the heavy

01:13:19.075 --> 01:13:20.510
and sharp objects for a reason.

01:13:20.543 --> 01:13:22.545
I thought you could keep
going with your script

01:13:22.578 --> 01:13:24.247
while we're holed up in here.

01:13:24.279 --> 01:13:27.683
Ah, umm... I've already
finished it.

01:13:27.717 --> 01:13:31.487
Well, I thought you
said you were struggling.

01:13:31.521 --> 01:13:33.723
On reflection, I
think I was overthinking

01:13:33.756 --> 01:13:35.958
through the whole thing.

01:13:35.992 --> 01:13:37.593
I'll give the manuscript
a quick read and drive it

01:13:37.627 --> 01:13:38.795
over to the studio first
thing in the morning.

01:13:38.828 --> 01:13:41.531
Oh, Charles, what
wonderful news.

01:13:41.564 --> 01:13:44.299
Daddy's gonna be over
the moon. As am I.

01:13:44.332 --> 01:13:45.568
Thank you, darling.

01:13:45.601 --> 01:13:48.604
Now we can both
focus on banishing Elvira

01:13:48.638 --> 01:13:51.207
into oblivion once and for all.

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:52.708
Not a moment too soon.

01:13:52.742 --> 01:13:55.244
Two's company.
Three's a nightmare.

01:13:59.949 --> 01:14:01.150
Nearly there.

01:14:05.721 --> 01:14:09.392
Vervain and dill hinder
witches from their will.

01:14:36.252 --> 01:14:37.086
Charles.

01:14:39.422 --> 01:14:40.256
Charles.

01:15:09.819 --> 01:15:10.987
Hello?

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:13.356
<i>Mrs. Condomine, I have news.</i>

01:15:13.389 --> 01:15:15.958
Doors are opening, and
change is in the air.

01:15:15.992 --> 01:15:18.027
<i>This is no time for
riddles, Madame Arcati.</i>

01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:20.029
<i>We've been urgently
trying to contact you.</i>

01:15:20.062 --> 01:15:22.431
Charles's life is
in grave danger.

01:15:22.465 --> 01:15:25.034
Elvira is trying to murder him.

01:15:25.067 --> 01:15:27.837
I feared she might
become a malevolent spirit.

01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:30.339
That's putting it
mildly. Where are you?

01:15:30.373 --> 01:15:31.807
In Sussex.

01:15:31.841 --> 01:15:34.210
I've gathered everything
together and now I'm ready.

01:15:34.243 --> 01:15:35.444
<i>For what?</i>

01:15:35.478 --> 01:15:36.979
Well, to send her
back, of course.

01:15:37.013 --> 01:15:39.548
Stay put, Madame Arcati.
I'll come and collect you.

01:15:43.886 --> 01:15:45.087
The telephone woke me.

01:15:45.988 --> 01:15:47.723
Apologies if I scared you.

01:15:47.757 --> 01:15:50.359
Ah, when Mr. Condomine
wakes up, tell him I've gone

01:15:50.394 --> 01:15:53.796
to fetch Madame Arcati and I
shall be back before lunch.

01:15:53.829 --> 01:15:56.766
Madame Arcati...
before...

01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:36.205
Don't hurt me, I beg you.

01:16:36.238 --> 01:16:38.307
You all right in
there, Mr. Condomine?

01:16:38.341 --> 01:16:40.076
I've never stopped loving you.

01:16:40.109 --> 01:16:41.677
Oh.

01:16:41.711 --> 01:16:44.381
I don't know what to say, sir.

01:16:44.414 --> 01:16:47.950
You have a funny way
of showing it, Charles.

01:16:47.984 --> 01:16:49.485
I was gonna put your
name on the manuscript

01:16:49.518 --> 01:16:52.154
before I delivered it
this morning, I promise.

01:16:52.188 --> 01:16:53.923
That won't be necessary, sir.

01:16:53.956 --> 01:16:55.392
I'm a woman, Charles.

01:16:55.425 --> 01:16:56.892
We're used to not getting
the credit we deserve.

01:16:56.926 --> 01:16:59.762
No, I insist. I'll get changed
and leave straightaway.

01:16:59.795 --> 01:17:02.131
Mrs. Condomine left
in the car a while ago.

01:17:02.164 --> 01:17:04.700
She said she would
be back by lunchtime.

01:17:06.002 --> 01:17:08.270
Elvira, what have you done?

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:21.584
Oops.

01:17:34.096 --> 01:17:39.101

01:18:44.934 --> 01:18:47.336
Mr. Condomine, I would
just like to say that

01:18:47.369 --> 01:18:51.575
I reproach myself bitterly.

01:18:51.607 --> 01:18:53.843
You are not to
blame, Madame Arcati.

01:18:53.876 --> 01:18:56.045
The fault lies squarely
on my shoulders.

01:18:57.447 --> 01:18:59.483
It was my ambition and ego

01:18:59.516 --> 01:19:02.885
that dragged us into
this unbearable mess.

01:19:02.918 --> 01:19:04.488
And that's something I
shall have to live with

01:19:04.521 --> 01:19:05.721
for the rest of my life.

01:19:07.089 --> 01:19:09.493
The last time I spoke
with Mrs. Condomine,

01:19:09.526 --> 01:19:11.760
your life was in danger.

01:19:11.794 --> 01:19:13.262
I urge you to come and see me

01:19:13.295 --> 01:19:15.532
at your earliest
possible convenience.

01:19:15.565 --> 01:19:17.400
Here is my card.

01:19:17.434 --> 01:19:18.267
I'll be waiting.

01:19:20.269 --> 01:19:22.705
You're not going to
stay for refreshments?

01:19:22.738 --> 01:19:25.509
Oh, please don't think
me rude, but I prefer

01:19:25.542 --> 01:19:28.210
to contemplate the
passing of a spirit

01:19:28.244 --> 01:19:30.012
in my own private way.

01:19:34.417 --> 01:19:37.319
My sincerest condolences,
Mr. Condomine.

01:19:43.292 --> 01:19:45.227
Shouldn't that
be congratulations?

01:19:46.762 --> 01:19:48.398
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:19:48.431 --> 01:19:50.332
Have you no shame?

01:19:50.366 --> 01:19:53.470
It was an accident, Charles.
I was trying to kill you.

01:19:53.503 --> 01:19:55.505
How can you be so heartless?

01:19:56.772 --> 01:19:58.542
Death does that to you.

01:19:58.575 --> 01:20:00.910
You know, you can always
tell how well regarded

01:20:00.943 --> 01:20:04.013
someone is by the
attendance at their funeral.

01:20:04.046 --> 01:20:05.247
What's that supposed to mean?

01:20:05.281 --> 01:20:07.584
Bit of a poor turnout
today, if you ask me.

01:20:07.617 --> 01:20:09.018
I barely counted forty people.

01:20:10.953 --> 01:20:12.054
That does it.

01:20:13.789 --> 01:20:15.559
Come here!

01:20:15.592 --> 01:20:18.227
Just like old times,
Charles.

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:21.363
Ahh! With you chasing me
round the garden!

01:20:21.398 --> 01:20:23.365
Only today there's gonna
be a different outcome!

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.042
- Will you excuse me?
- Of course.

01:20:42.117 --> 01:20:45.054
I'm sorry for your
loss, Mr. Mackintosh.

01:20:45.087 --> 01:20:47.890
Ruth was a fine woman,
and a good friend.

01:20:49.091 --> 01:20:51.060
I'm going to miss her deeply.

01:20:51.093 --> 01:20:54.763
Thank you, Mrs. Bradman. I
know she was fond of you too.

01:20:56.232 --> 01:20:57.833
I can't quite
believe she's gone.

01:21:00.202 --> 01:21:02.405
My mother always said
that time is a physician

01:21:02.439 --> 01:21:04.273
that heals every grief.

01:21:12.948 --> 01:21:14.183
Ohh!

01:21:14.216 --> 01:21:15.784
You never were
much of an opponent

01:21:15.818 --> 01:21:17.654
on the croquet lawn, Charles.

01:21:18.488 --> 01:21:20.122
You repulse me.

01:21:23.125 --> 01:21:25.194
I'm going to kill you.

01:21:28.197 --> 01:21:30.634
Don't be an imbecile.
I'm already dead.

01:21:30.667 --> 01:21:32.268
You better fetch
your medicinal bag

01:21:32.301 --> 01:21:35.070
before someone else gets killed.

01:21:35.104 --> 01:21:39.442
Edna was right.
This place is cursed.

01:21:39.476 --> 01:21:41.877
I can't bear to
see you ever again.

01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:43.446
The feeling's mutual, Charles.

01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:47.651
With age and disappointment,
you've become a pompous ass.

01:21:47.684 --> 01:21:50.085
Charles, Charles!

01:21:51.787 --> 01:21:53.088
Everything's gonna be splendid.

01:21:53.122 --> 01:21:54.056
Not while she's
here, it won't.

01:21:54.089 --> 01:21:55.958
Not while who's here?

01:21:55.991 --> 01:21:56.825
Elvira!

01:22:15.311 --> 01:22:16.413
Where am I?

01:22:16.446 --> 01:22:17.447
In the loony bin.

01:22:30.694 --> 01:22:32.395
There's no point in
struggling, Charles.

01:22:32.429 --> 01:22:35.964
The more you thrash around,
the longer they'll keep you in.

01:22:35.998 --> 01:22:37.266
Why am I here?

01:22:37.299 --> 01:22:39.001
You've been sectioned under
the Mental Treatment Act

01:22:39.034 --> 01:22:42.104
and held under mandatory
observation for the next 28 days.

01:22:42.137 --> 01:22:44.808
I hope you rot in hell.

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:47.076
It's not wise
to be bad-tempered

01:22:47.109 --> 01:22:48.745
with the only person
who can help you.

01:22:48.778 --> 01:22:50.979
I'd rather eat my own
tongue than ask you for help.

01:22:51.013 --> 01:22:52.716
Hmm, You might
just get to do that.

01:22:52.749 --> 01:22:54.883
Dr. McEwan is planning on
taking you down the corridor

01:22:54.917 --> 01:22:57.620
in 15 minutes for
electric shock treatment.

01:22:57.654 --> 01:22:59.422
- What?
- Mm.

01:22:59.456 --> 01:23:01.624
No! No, come back. Wait.

01:23:03.593 --> 01:23:05.094
Of course,
there's usually a way

01:23:05.127 --> 01:23:06.696
around these things.

01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:08.197
What do you want from me?

01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:13.470
I know you're never going
to forgive me, Charles,

01:23:13.503 --> 01:23:16.105
and being stuck in
purgatory with you grieving

01:23:16.138 --> 01:23:19.609
over another woman is a
fate worse than death.

01:23:19.642 --> 01:23:21.910
I couldn't agree more.

01:23:21.944 --> 01:23:24.980
Which is why I want a divorce.

01:23:25.981 --> 01:23:27.015
With pleasure.

01:23:28.752 --> 01:23:31.153
And I know just the person
who can execute that.

01:23:41.464 --> 01:23:42.364
Good.

01:23:47.837 --> 01:23:49.572
Oh, move over.

01:23:49.606 --> 01:23:51.441
No way I'm putting my
life in your hands again.

01:23:51.474 --> 01:23:53.375
Don't flatter
yourself, Charles.

01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:55.445
When I think of what might
have happened if I'd succeeded

01:23:55.478 --> 01:23:57.714
in getting you to the other
side, it makes me shudder.

01:23:57.747 --> 01:24:00.215
Nothing but bickering and
squabbling for eternity.

01:24:03.218 --> 01:24:04.754
Drive.

01:24:11.260 --> 01:24:12.961
Looking back on
our married years,

01:24:12.995 --> 01:24:14.497
I can see now with
horrid clarity,

01:24:14.531 --> 01:24:16.433
they were nothing but a mockery.

01:24:16.466 --> 01:24:19.436
You were feckless,
irresponsible,

01:24:20.269 --> 01:24:22.806
morally unstable.

01:24:22.839 --> 01:24:24.339
I think I realized that before
we left Budleigh Salterton.

01:24:24.373 --> 01:24:26.643
Nobody but a monumental
bore would have thought

01:24:26.676 --> 01:24:29.278
of going to Budleigh
Salterton for a honeymoon.

01:24:29.311 --> 01:24:30.713
What's the matter
with Budleigh Salterton?

01:24:30.747 --> 01:24:33.315
Seven hours a day
on a damn golf course

01:24:33.348 --> 01:24:36.719
and a three-piece orchestra
playing <i>Merrie England.</i>

01:24:36.753 --> 01:24:39.154
I'm surprised you didn't
complain at the time.

01:24:39.188 --> 01:24:40.657
I remember you being
quite good at that.

01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:42.090
I did complain.

01:24:42.124 --> 01:24:44.627
But you wouldn't listen.

01:24:44.661 --> 01:24:47.397
That's why I took a
romantic stroll on the moors

01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:49.866
with Captain Bracegirdle.

01:24:49.899 --> 01:24:51.200
What a blind fool I was.

01:24:52.735 --> 01:24:54.369
Did he make love to you?

01:24:54.404 --> 01:24:56.371
Only very discretely.

01:25:02.044 --> 01:25:06.014
Mr. Condomine. I'm so
relieved you've arrived safely.

01:25:06.048 --> 01:25:07.484
Follow me.

01:25:07.517 --> 01:25:09.853
Tonight the moon is full, and
we must harness its power.

01:25:09.886 --> 01:25:10.986
We're both ready to perform

01:25:11.019 --> 01:25:12.755
the banishment
ceremony immediately.

01:25:14.591 --> 01:25:15.425
She's here?

01:25:16.559 --> 01:25:17.827
Yes.

01:25:17.861 --> 01:25:20.864
Are you sure she's
amenable to the process?

01:25:20.897 --> 01:25:21.865
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:25:28.270 --> 01:25:34.109
With this magic smoke I
invoke the spirit of moon fire,

01:25:34.142 --> 01:25:37.947
dancer of time, mistress
of endings and beginnings.

01:25:39.248 --> 01:25:43.151
To return our sacred sister
to her rightful sphere.

01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:45.555
Still here?

01:25:45.588 --> 01:25:46.456
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:25:49.626 --> 01:25:52.695
To you, the spirit of earth.

01:25:52.729 --> 01:25:54.363
To you, the element of air.

01:25:55.899 --> 01:25:58.535
To you, the force of water.

01:25:58.568 --> 01:26:00.703
To you, the power of fire.

01:26:01.671 --> 01:26:04.206
And the gift of enchanter's dew.

01:26:09.579 --> 01:26:10.914
She still here?

01:26:10.947 --> 01:26:12.180
Yes.

01:26:12.214 --> 01:26:14.182
Yes.

01:26:14.216 --> 01:26:17.587
Ghostly specter,
ghoul and fiend,

01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:19.756
never more be thou convened.

01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:23.258
Wolfsbane and holy rite,

01:26:23.292 --> 01:26:25.227
banish thee into the night.

01:26:28.798 --> 01:26:31.034
Oh, bladderwort, bladderwort.

01:26:31.066 --> 01:26:32.067
Bladderwort.

01:26:33.302 --> 01:26:34.303
Oh.

01:26:34.336 --> 01:26:35.170
Oh yes.

01:26:36.338 --> 01:26:37.172
Yes.

01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:40.375
And bladderwort.

01:26:46.315 --> 01:26:47.249
Ruth.

01:26:47.282 --> 01:26:48.017
Ruth?

01:26:49.284 --> 01:26:50.520
Darling, I'm so
happy to see you again.

01:26:53.022 --> 01:26:54.824
Blast. How could I
have been such a duffer?

01:26:54.857 --> 01:26:57.259
Something must have
gone hideously wrong.

01:26:57.292 --> 01:26:59.161
Yes, not for the first time.

01:26:59.194 --> 01:27:00.663
You hussy.

01:27:00.697 --> 01:27:02.097
Darling.

01:27:02.130 --> 01:27:05.300
Save yourself the
effort. I'm already dead.

01:27:05.334 --> 01:27:07.202
And more to the
point, so are you.

01:27:07.235 --> 01:27:09.072
You popped your
clogs last Tuesday.

01:27:09.104 --> 01:27:11.139
Don't be so insensitive.

01:27:11.173 --> 01:27:12.609
Darling, are you in any pain?

01:27:14.343 --> 01:27:16.779
Charles, what happened to me?

01:27:18.615 --> 01:27:19.749
There was a car accident.

01:27:19.782 --> 01:27:22.685
Which, I have to
admit, I had a hand in.

01:27:22.719 --> 01:27:23.886
I'm sorry, Ruth.

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:26.254
I'm afraid sorry
doesn't quite cut it.

01:27:26.288 --> 01:27:29.659
Well, even so, in the
spirit of complete openness,

01:27:29.692 --> 01:27:31.628
I'd also like to
apologies for conducting

01:27:31.661 --> 01:27:35.098
an affair with Charles
right under your nose.

01:27:35.130 --> 01:27:37.567
Well, technically, we
are still married, so...

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.937
Stop it, Elvira. Ruth has
been through quite enough.

01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:43.205
What are they
saying, Mr. Condomine?

01:27:43.238 --> 01:27:44.407
Not now, Madame Arcati.

01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:45.942
Things are becoming
quite strained.

01:27:45.975 --> 01:27:48.544
You know, I should have
squeezed malum citrea

01:27:48.578 --> 01:27:50.013
at the crucial point.

01:27:50.046 --> 01:27:52.048
That's lemon juice. Lemon juice.

01:27:53.449 --> 01:27:55.350
The only reason he was able
to get through that screenplay

01:27:55.385 --> 01:27:57.387
in five days flat is
because I wrote it.

01:27:58.488 --> 01:27:59.489
Yes...

01:27:59.522 --> 01:28:01.189
Charles, is that true?

01:28:01.223 --> 01:28:03.860
Not exactly.

01:28:03.893 --> 01:28:06.161
And Charles didn't want
to tell you we'd finished

01:28:06.194 --> 01:28:08.865
because he wanted to spend
more time alone with me.

01:28:10.298 --> 01:28:11.333
Ugh.

01:28:11.366 --> 01:28:12.468
Charles.

01:28:13.368 --> 01:28:15.237
Let's not fight, darling.

01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:17.607
Which darling are
you referring to?

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:19.341
But after everything
I put up with,

01:28:19.374 --> 01:28:20.877
how could you do that to me?

01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:23.780
It's not that
straightforward, darlings.

01:28:23.813 --> 01:28:25.515
I mean, really, Charles,

01:28:25.548 --> 01:28:27.684
you never loved Elvira or me.

01:28:27.717 --> 01:28:31.219
The only person that
you loved is yourself.

01:28:31.253 --> 01:28:32.689
No.

01:28:32.722 --> 01:28:34.991
Finally, something
we do agree on.

01:28:37.593 --> 01:28:38.895
If you wrote the script,

01:28:40.463 --> 01:28:42.165
did he write any of those books?

01:28:42.197 --> 01:28:43.032
No, not a word.

01:28:43.066 --> 01:28:44.400
He took all the glory?

01:28:44.434 --> 01:28:45.802
Aren't you staying
for the second act?

01:28:45.835 --> 01:28:47.036
I think it's best I leave.

01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:50.205
Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned.

01:28:50.238 --> 01:28:51.339
Try two of them.

01:28:52.775 --> 01:28:54.077
Good luck with the lemons.

01:28:56.612 --> 01:28:57.513
Where did he go?

01:28:58.781 --> 01:29:00.616
Huh, he can run...

01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:02.018
But he can't hide.

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:20.036
Ghostly specter,
ghoul or fiend,

01:29:20.069 --> 01:29:22.939
never more be thou convened.

01:29:22.972 --> 01:29:26.209
Bladderwort, wolfsbane
and holy rite,

01:29:27.275 --> 01:29:29.946
banish thee into the night.

01:29:44.326 --> 01:29:45.260
Donald?

01:30:16.259 --> 01:30:18.661
Alright, I'm gonna start
with this medium shot here.

01:30:18.694 --> 01:30:20.696
Then I'm gonna come
a little closer, okay?

01:30:20.730 --> 01:30:22.265
Alright, let's
have some passion.

01:30:22.297 --> 01:30:23.633
Alright, roll camera.

01:30:26.836 --> 01:30:28.738
- Quiet, please.
- Quiet, please. Sound running.

01:30:28.771 --> 01:30:30.506
Scene 84, take one.

01:30:31.373 --> 01:30:33.176
And action.

01:30:33.209 --> 01:30:36.311
Just being close
to you, Frank,

01:30:36.344 --> 01:30:38.815
I feel as if I'm
completely naked.

01:30:40.216 --> 01:30:44.487
How do you always manage
to see right through me?

01:30:45.521 --> 01:30:47.557
That's
my job, sweetie.

01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:48.391
I just do it.

01:30:49.826 --> 01:30:50.793
Cut.

01:30:52.195 --> 01:30:52.995
Reset.

01:30:55.031 --> 01:30:58.100
I'm not, er... I'm not
feeling the last line.

01:30:59.502 --> 01:31:01.237
Boy wonder, what else you got?

01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:03.172
Uh... wh... uhh...

01:31:07.276 --> 01:31:11.447
What about... 'I see things
just the way they are.

01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:13.783
The rest of the
world needs bifocals.'

01:31:16.485 --> 01:31:17.820
I love it.

01:31:17.854 --> 01:31:19.422
Okay, reset.

01:31:19.455 --> 01:31:20.756
Make-up.

01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:22.124
I wanna move in closer.

01:31:23.726 --> 01:31:25.862
You're a genius, Charles.

01:31:25.895 --> 01:31:28.865
Audiences are gonna devour
the whole spiritualist angle.

01:31:28.898 --> 01:31:29.732
Yes.

01:31:32.134 --> 01:31:35.905
Just a shame Ruth
isn't here to enjoy it.

01:31:39.408 --> 01:31:43.012
Mr. Condomine. Hedda
Hopper, <i>Los Angeles Times.</i>

01:31:43.045 --> 01:31:43.880
Oh.

01:31:45.882 --> 01:31:47.016
Hello.

01:31:47.049 --> 01:31:48.718
How does it feel to
be the talk of the town?

01:31:48.751 --> 01:31:50.152
Oh, that's awfully sweet
of you, but I'm not sure

01:31:50.186 --> 01:31:52.221
anybody's really interested
in the lowly writer.

01:31:53.756 --> 01:31:55.725
Oh, I have a hunch that
my 35 million readers

01:31:55.758 --> 01:31:59.528
will be enthralled by the
story of a serial plagiarist.

01:31:59.562 --> 01:32:01.130
Plagiarist?

01:32:01.163 --> 01:32:03.499
I know you revel in gossip
and scandal, Miss Hopper,

01:32:03.532 --> 01:32:04.800
but that's a
completely outrageous

01:32:04.834 --> 01:32:06.469
and unfounded accusation.

01:32:06.502 --> 01:32:08.337
There is nothing
unfounded about the writ

01:32:08.371 --> 01:32:10.373
that Senor Morales is serving.

01:32:10.406 --> 01:32:12.708
Would you care to
comment on the fact

01:32:12.742 --> 01:32:15.578
that your 15 Detective
Frank Flowers whodunnits

01:32:15.611 --> 01:32:18.981
are based word for word on
the Inspector Francisco Flores

01:32:19.015 --> 01:32:22.451

bestsellers across all of Mexico?

01:32:22.485 --> 01:32:25.054
