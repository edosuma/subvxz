KNOCKED UP SUNSHINE.

- THIS IS

GIVE IT TO YOU.

WHETHER YOU WANT TO ADMIT IT OR
NOT, YOU STILL LOVE EACH OTHER.

- I DO NOT LOVE HIM.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.322
I DON'T.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.257
AND HE CERTAINLY
DOESN'T LOVE ME.

03:43.291 --> 03:44.758
I MEAN, DID HE SHOW UP ONCE
TO VISIT ME AT THE HOSPITAL?

03:44.792 --> 03:48.329
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
HE DID.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.730
I'M SURE HE'D NEVER WANT ME
TO TELL YOU THIS...

03:49.763 --> 03:51.799
- AS IF I CARE.
- BUT THE NIGHT OF THE BOMBING,

03:51.832 --> 03:53.467
WHEN YOU'D LOST
ALL THAT BLOOD

03:53.501 --> 03:55.403
AND WE WERE AFRAID
WE WERE GONNA LOSE YOU,

03:55.436 --> 03:58.539
BRIAN WAS WITH US
IN THE E.R.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.441
HE WANTED TO DONATE
HIS OWN BLOOD,

04:00.474 --> 04:01.875
BUT THE DOCTOR REFUSED
TO TAKE IT BECAUSE HE'S GAY.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.878
WELL, WHEN BRIAN HEARD THAT,
HE WENT INTO A RAGE.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.347
- HE DID?

04:06.380 --> 04:07.881
- YEAH,
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HIM.

04:07.915 --> 04:11.018
HE WAS LIKE A WILD MAN.

04:11.051 --> 04:14.688
- YEAH, HE CAN
GET THAT WAY.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.491
- POINT IS,
A PERSON WOULDN'T ACT THAT WAY

04:17.525 --> 04:20.328
UNLESS HE LOVED SOMEONE.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.666
- HUH.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.038
- WHEN YOU'RE DONE CLEARING,
TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE

04:31.071 --> 04:32.573
AND MAKE SURE
YOU MOP THE FLOOR.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.908
- ANYTHING ELSE?
- THANKS FOR REMINDING ME.

IN THE GENTS'.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.812
- SO GLAD I ASKED.

- HEY, WATCH HOW
YOU'RE CARRYING THAT, HUH?

04:45.085 --> 04:46.787
YOU BREAK ANYTHING,
IT COMES OUT OF YOUR PAY.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.722
- AREN'T YOU BEING
A LITTLE ROUGH ON THE KID?

04:48.756 --> 04:50.057
- HEY, THE KID
DOESN'T LIKE IT HERE,

04:50.090 --> 04:51.792
THE KID CAN GO
BACK TO SCHOOL,

04:51.825 --> 04:53.060
WHERE HE BELONGS.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.329

YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING.

05:04.872 --> 05:07.074
- SO WHEN DID YOU JOIN
THE SERVICE INDUSTRY?

05:07.107 --> 05:10.678
- IN CASE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN,
IT'S HOW I GOT MY START.

05:10.711 --> 05:13.080
- THE IRONMEN JUST LOST
THEIR FIFTH IN A ROW.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.548
- I GUESS THEY'D SOONER
GO STRAIGHT TO THE CELLAR

05:14.582 --> 05:16.417
THAN GAILY
TO THE SUPER BOWL.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.752
- THEY'VE EVEN GOT MARKHAM
IN THERE DOING LONG THROWS.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.688
- WITH THAT ARM?

05:20.721 --> 05:23.991

MUST'VE BEEN LIMPER THAN MINE.

AREN'T AS CUTE AS YOURS.

EXCUSE ME, FOLKS.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.456

- HONEY, DON'T GO NEAR THAT.

I SUPPOSE THE ONLY THING
REMOTELY RESEMBLING A BOMB

06:15.208 --> 06:18.879
IS THE DVD OF ALEXANDER
I RENTED FROM THE VIDEO STORE.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.682
- BLACKENED CHICKEN CAESAR.
- BYE-BYE.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.083

06:23.116 --> 06:25.619

TO GET TOGETHER.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.788
OKAY. THANKS.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.495

ABOUT GETTING MOMMY WET?

06:34.528 --> 06:35.563
- [babbles]

06:35.596 --> 06:37.431
- DID YOU HAVE
TO BUY HIM THAT?

06:37.465 --> 06:39.933
- IT'S ONLY WATER.
THAT WAS JENNIFER.

06:39.967 --> 06:40.934
THERE'S A COUPLE
INTERESTED IN THE HOUSE.

06:40.968 --> 06:42.169
- OH.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.938
- "OH," WHAT?
- OH, NOTHING.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.575
- OH, HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS?
- WELL, OF COURSE.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.777
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE SHOULDN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.045
- LISTEN,
IT'S A BIG DECISION.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.815
I WAS UP HALF THE NIGHT
WORRYING ABOUT IT MYSELF.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.117
- OH, I THOUGHT
IT WAS THE ENCHILADAS.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.052
- WHEN I LOOK
AT OUR KIDS' FACES,

06:59.086 --> 07:00.688
I THINK, WHY SHOULD
THEY GROW UP SOMEPLACE

07:00.721 --> 07:01.989
WHERE THEY'RE TOLD
THEIR PARENTS ARE SICK?

07:02.022 --> 07:04.057
WHERE THEY'RE HURT
AND HUMILIATED?

07:04.091 --> 07:05.593
THAT KIND OF PAIN
IS INDELIBLE.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.127
YOU CAN NEVER
WASH IT OFF.

07:07.160 --> 07:11.532
- WE HAVE TO TALK
TO BRIAN AND MICHAEL FIRST.

07:11.565 --> 07:14.201
- AH, I'M SURE BRIAN
WON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.003
- HE'LL PROBABLY SAY,
"SO LONG, SONNY BOY,

07:16.036 --> 07:18.205
DON'T FORGET
YOUR OLD DAD."

07:18.238 --> 07:19.206
- HMM.

07:19.239 --> 07:22.109
MICHAEL'S ANOTHER STORY.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.947
- IF ANYONE HAD ASKED ME,
I WOULD'VE SAID

07:26.980 --> 07:29.883
I'D BE DOING BRITNEY
AND WHOEVER'S WEDDING FIRST.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.218
- WELL, WE'LL BE SURE
TO RECOMMEND YOU.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.686
- [chuckles]

07:32.720 --> 07:34.087
NOW, I'VE GONE OVER
YOUR WISH LIST,

07:34.121 --> 07:36.557
AND EVERYTHING SEEMS
FAIRLY CUT AND DRY...

07:36.590 --> 07:37.825
BUT FABULOUS,

07:37.858 --> 07:39.960
EXCEPT FOR
THIS ONE LITTLE ITEM HERE.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.829
"GOLDEN GARDENIAS"?

THAT ONCE YOUR LOVER

07:43.664 --> 07:45.232
BREATHES THEM,
THEN HE'LL LOVE YOU FOREVER.

07:45.265 --> 07:48.168
- OH, I'LL CALL THE FLORIST,
ORDER A CRATE.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.003
- THEY ONLY GROW
IN THE XISHUANGBANNA MOUNTAINS

07:50.037 --> 07:51.572
IN SOUTHERN CHINA.

07:51.605 --> 07:52.773
- HOW ABOUT SOME PETUNIAS

07:52.806 --> 07:54.107
THAT ONLY GROW
IN SOUTHERN PITTSBURGH?

07:54.141 --> 07:56.143
- IF JUSTIN WANTS
GOLDEN GARDENIAS...

07:56.176 --> 07:59.680
- ALL RIGHT, THEN HE'LL HAVE
GOLDEN GARDENIAS.

08:01.882 --> 08:02.916
MICHAEL,

08:02.950 --> 08:05.018
LOOK AT YOU!
YOU'RE UP.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.588
- AND OUT.
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

08:07.621 --> 08:08.789
- THE DOCTOR
SAYS I'LL LIVE,

08:08.822 --> 08:11.058
PROVIDED I STAY AWAY
FROM BOMBS.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.860

08:12.893 --> 08:14.595

UH, PLANNING

08:14.628 --> 08:16.730
THE, UH,
TAYLOR-KINNEY NUPTIALS.

08:16.764 --> 08:18.532
- WELL, UH,
DON'T LET ME DISTURB YOU.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.133
- OH, NO, ACTUALLY,
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.769
FOR CHINA.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.772
IF YOU WOULD POINT ME
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.012
- I GOT YOUR INVITATION.

08:32.045 --> 08:36.917
AFTER I NEARLY DIED
A SECOND TIME FROM SHOCK,

08:36.950 --> 08:40.220
I DECIDED
I'D COME DOWN AND SAY

08:40.253 --> 08:43.891
CONGRATULATIONS.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.627
- WELL, I FIGURE, IF IT MAKES
JUSTIN HAPPY, WHAT THE HELL?

08:46.660 --> 08:49.029
- LIKE YOU'VE EVER DONE ANYTHING
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.231
- MM.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.033
WELL,
AS YOU SO ELOQUENTLY PUT IT,

08:53.066 --> 08:55.302
I CAN'T GO ON BEING AN
OVER-THE-HILL CLUB BOY FOREVER.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.104
- [chuckles]

08:57.137 --> 08:59.072
STILL, NO ONE
MAKES A BETTER CASE

08:59.106 --> 09:01.942
FOR PERPETUAL IMMATURITY
THAN YOU.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.980
LOOK, WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN US,

09:07.014 --> 09:10.317
I-I, UM, I JUST WANTED TO SAY...
- FORGET IT.

09:10.350 --> 09:13.053
I BEHAVED LIKE
AN ASSHOLE.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.555
YOU BEHAVED LIKE
A BIGGER ONE.

09:18.125 --> 09:21.061
[sighs]

09:21.094 --> 09:22.996
SO...

09:24.765 --> 09:27.801
YOU WANT TO BE
MY BEST MAN?

09:27.835 --> 09:29.069
- REALLY?

09:29.102 --> 09:32.706
- YOU'VE ALWAYS
STOOD UP FOR ME.

09:32.740 --> 09:35.008
WHY SHOULD NOW
BE ANY DIFFERENT?

09:36.109 --> 09:38.011
- [chuckles]

09:48.388 --> 09:50.123
HEY.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.825

AND SPARKLING WATER.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.266
- COSMO.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.035
- WELL, THE TIMES--
THEY SURE ARE A-CHANGING.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.436
WHO'D EVER THOUGHT
WE'D HAVE TO PASS

10:36.469 --> 10:38.205
THROUGH A METAL DETECTOR
TO GET INTO WOODY'S?

10:38.238 --> 10:40.407
- YEAH, OR THAT BRIAN KINNEY
WOULD BE GETTING HITCHED.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.441
- YEAH.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.076
OR THAT I'D BE TURNING 35.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.746
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

10:45.779 --> 10:48.682
- THAT IS UNBELIEVABLE.

10:48.716 --> 10:52.185
- OKAY, 36.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.755
AND A HALF?

10:54.788 --> 10:55.789
ALL RIGHT,
FINE, 39.

10:55.823 --> 10:57.290
ANYWAY, I'M THROWING MYSELF

10:57.324 --> 10:58.759
A LITTLE CELEBRATION
DOWN AT TANGO.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.027
- [gasps]
LOVE THAT PLACE.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.162
- IT'S GONNA BE,
UH, YOU AND DREW,

11:02.195 --> 11:04.164
MICHAEL AND BEN,
MEL AND LINZ,

11:04.197 --> 11:06.834
BRIAN AND JUSTIN.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.435
TEDDY.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.303
- WELL, IT'S--
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY,

11:10.337 --> 11:13.340
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S ALL ALONE.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.942
- MAYBE NOT FOR LONG.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.444
- YOU MET SOMEONE?
AGAIN?

11:17.477 --> 11:19.947
- NOT JUST "SOMEONE."
THE ONE.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.182
EM, THIS TIME
I THINK I'VE REALLY FOUND HIM.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.984
- TEDDY, TELL ME,
TELL ME, TELL ME.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.786
WHO? WHERE?
WHEN? HOW?

11:25.819 --> 11:28.822
- WELL, I WAS SHARING AT AA,
AND HE WAS SHARING AT AA.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.958
THEN WE HAD SOME COFFEE,
THEN WE WENT BACK TO MY PLACE,

11:30.991 --> 11:32.492
AND WE SHARED
A LITTLE MORE.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.194
- AND HIS NAME?
I NEED FACTS.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.863
HARD--HOPEFULLY--
FACTS.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.364
- HIS NAME IS TAD.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.366
- OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S SO ADORABLE.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.334
TAD AND TED.
TED AND TAD.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.103
IT WAS MEANT TO BE.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.805
WHAT'S HE LOOK LIKE?
I WANT AN EXACT DESCRIPTION.

11:44.838 --> 11:50.477
- UH, WELL, HE LOOKS,
UH, EXACTLY LIKE, UM...

11:50.510 --> 11:55.415
- * I WANT IT,
I NEED IT *

11:55.448 --> 11:58.518
- THAT.
- HEY, HANDSOME.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.020
- MMM.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.222
OH. MMM.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.957

12:03.991 --> 12:06.226
TAD, THIS IS EMMETT.
EMMETT, THIS IS TAD.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.361
- HELLO, GORGEOUS.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.097
- TED TALKS ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.865
- YEAH, WELL,
IF IT CAN'T BE REPEATED,

12:11.899 --> 12:12.866
THEN IT'S TRUE.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.367
[all chuckle]

12:14.401 --> 12:15.969
- I'VE MISSED YOU.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.005
- IT'S ONLY BEEN A DAY.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.974
- FOR A MONARCH BUTTERFLY,
THAT'S AN ENTIRE LIFETIME.

12:21.008 --> 12:23.010
- AWW.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.145
MMM.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.849
- TOP-OF-THE-LINE APPLIANCES,

12:28.882 --> 12:32.152
HARDWOOD FLOORS,
18-FOOT CEILINGS.

12:32.185 --> 12:35.255
THERE'S NOT ANOTHER LOFT
LIKE IT IN PITTSBURGH.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.523
- YEAH, I KNOW.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.391
I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.428
- EVERYONE I SHOW IT TO
HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.530
UM...
[clears throat]

12:43.563 --> 12:45.933
HERE'S A TEAR SHEET.
IT'S GOT ALL THE DETAILS.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.300
JUST, UM,

12:47.334 --> 12:50.303
GIVE ME A CALL
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.140
- MIND GIVING ME
THE TOUR?

12:53.173 --> 12:55.142
- WELL, I WAS JUST
ABOUT TO LOCK UP.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.177
I'M SURE YOU CAN
FIND YOUR WAY AROUND.

12:57.210 --> 13:00.413
- MOM...WAIT.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.950
- I'M REALLY BUSY.
I'M IN A HURRY.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.320
WHAT'S THIS?

13:07.354 --> 13:10.457
[opening envelope]

13:22.936 --> 13:25.172
OH, HONEY.

13:25.205 --> 13:29.042
THAT'S...
THAT'S...

13:29.076 --> 13:30.443
- [chuckles]

13:30.477 --> 13:32.345
- THAT'S JUST...

13:34.214 --> 13:36.449
- UNBELIEVABLE?
I KNOW.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.351
[both laugh]

13:38.385 --> 13:40.320
THAT SEEMS TO BE
THE GENERAL CONSENSUS.

13:40.353 --> 13:44.057
- [laughs]

13:44.091 --> 13:46.493
- AND BY THE WAY, IT'S FOR TWO,
SO BRING ANYONE YOU'D LIKE.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.497
- ANYONE?
- YES.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.334

13:54.367 --> 13:55.635
[chuckles]

13:55.668 --> 13:58.338
OH, BUT I-I HAVE
ONE CONDITION.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.340
- I PROMISE I WON'T MAKE
ANY RUDE REFERENCES

14:00.373 --> 14:01.641
TO HIS AGE.
OR YOURS.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.343
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
YOU WON'T,

14:03.376 --> 14:06.346
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.949
I GET THE FIRST DANCE.
AFTER BRIAN.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.118
- EH, YEAH, NO FUCKING WAY.
- [laughs]

14:11.151 --> 14:14.154
I DON'T CARE
IF IT'S CORNY.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.156
THE LAST TIME
WE DANCED WAS...

14:16.189 --> 14:17.290
YOUR COUSIN
JOANNE'S WEDDING.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.491
- I WAS SIX.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.093
- STILL REMEMBER
HOW TO FOX-TROT?

14:20.127 --> 14:22.162
- NO.
- [laughs] SURE, YOU DO.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.031
- NO, I DON'T.
- SURE, YOU DO. COME ON.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.565
- NO.
- COME ON!

14:25.598 --> 14:28.001
COME ON.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.002
- MOM.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.670
- [laughs]

14:30.703 --> 14:31.671
- OOH.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.873
- WELL...

14:38.345 --> 14:39.379
[chuckles]

14:39.412 --> 14:41.448
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

14:41.481 --> 14:45.285
NEVER TOO BIG
TO DANCE WITH YOUR MOM.

14:45.318 --> 14:48.421
- HMM.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.990
- THE OWNER
OF THE IRONMEN CALLED.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.258
HE WANTS ME TO COME BACK.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.193
- WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME
HE REALIZED

14:53.226 --> 14:54.995
THAT WINNING THE CHAMPIONSHIP
IS MORE IMPORTANT

14:55.028 --> 14:58.065
THAN WHO YOU'RE FUCKING,
EVEN IF IT IS ME.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.300
- I JUST HOPE MY TEAMMATES
FEEL THE SAME WAY.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.670
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT THEM.
JUST DO WHAT YOU DO BEST.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.605
WELL, SECOND BEST.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.609
- EMMETT, THANKS.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.311
- FOR WHAT?

15:11.344 --> 15:13.446
- BEING THERE,
HELPING ME.

15:13.480 --> 15:17.550
- ALL I DID WAS LEND
A LITTLE BACKFIELD SUPPORT.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.052
IT'S YOUR VICTORY.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.454
YOUR...TOUCHDOWN.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.557
- FIRST ONE'S FOR YOU.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.459
- HMM.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.366
- TRY ONE
OF THE LACE COOKIES.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.601
- DEPENDS ON
WHAT THEY'RE LACED WITH.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.036
- HOW'S MY DARLING
LITTLE DAUGHTER?

15:36.069 --> 15:37.604
- GORGEOUS AS EVER.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.706
- YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GONNA GO
GIVE HER A SQUEEZE.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.341
- OH,
BEFORE YOU DO, UH,

15:41.374 --> 15:43.443
THERE'S SOMETHING
WE NEED TO DISCUSS,

15:43.476 --> 15:46.479
UH, WITH BOTH OF YOU.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.118
- HOMEMADE COOKIES.

15:51.151 --> 15:54.721
WE MUST BE IN TROUBLE.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.689
- I, UM...

15:58.391 --> 16:01.094
I DON'T QUITE KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU THIS.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.095
- I DO.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.997
UH, LINZ AND I
TALKED IT OVER,

16:04.031 --> 16:05.765
AND WE DECIDED
WE WANT TO MOVE.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.201
- WHAT, THE PLACE GETTING
TOO TIGHT FOR THE FOUR OF YOU?

16:08.235 --> 16:09.769
HEADING OFF
TO THE SUBURBS?

16:09.802 --> 16:12.772
- I SUPPOSE
YOU COULD THINK OF IT AS THAT.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.375
- WE WANT TO MOVE
TO CANADA.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.750
- TO TORONTO.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.618
IT'S NOT REALLY
VERY FAR.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.121
- HELL, YOU EVEN
BICYCLED THERE.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.357
- FLYING TIME,
IT'S ONLY 45 MINUTES.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.359
- IT'S STILL
A FOREIGN COUNTRY.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.526
- WELL, IT'S NOT
LIKE UZBEKISTAN

16:33.560 --> 16:36.229
OR THE EMIRATE OF QATAR.

16:36.263 --> 16:37.630
- ARE THOSE REAL PLACES?

16:37.664 --> 16:40.100
- HOW THE FUCK
SHOULD I KNOW?

16:40.133 --> 16:41.634
- BUT WHY WOULD YOU?
UH...

16:41.668 --> 16:44.504
- I THOUGHT MY MARRYING JUSTIN
WAS A BIG SHOCKEROO.

16:44.537 --> 16:48.441
- THE POINT IS,
WE NO LONGER FEEL SAFE HERE.

16:48.475 --> 16:51.444
- OR EVEN WELCOME
IN OUR OWN COUNTRY.

16:51.478 --> 16:52.679
AT LEAST THERE,
WE WON'T BE TREATED

16:52.712 --> 16:54.114
LIKE SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.382
I MEAN, MAKE
THAT THIRD-CLASS

16:55.415 --> 16:57.650
IF PROPOSITION 14 PASSES.

16:57.684 --> 17:02.055
- YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT TAKING J.R. AND GUS.

17:02.089 --> 17:04.257
- THAT'S WHY
BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING,

17:04.291 --> 17:06.293
WE WANT YOUR APPROVAL.

17:08.428 --> 17:11.398
YOUR BLESSING.

17:11.431 --> 17:14.301
- OTHERWISE WE DON'T GO.

17:20.307 --> 17:23.143
[jazz music]

17:23.176 --> 17:24.411
- GOOD EVENING.
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?

17:24.444 --> 17:26.446
YEAH, UH, TABLE FOR SCHMIDT.
- UH, YES.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.448
- OKAY. THANKS.

17:28.481 --> 17:32.585
*

17:32.619 --> 17:33.853
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.855
- IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
- MMM.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.190
OH, JUST CRAZY HECTIC.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.691
- YEAH, I WAS CONCERNED.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.227
I LEFT YOU THREE MESSAGES.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.594
YOU DIDN'T CALL BACK.
- I'M SORRY.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.497
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TIME
TO CHECK MY CELL.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.333
YEP, THREE MESSAGES.

17:46.366 --> 17:48.601
SO WHAT'S SO URGENT?

17:48.635 --> 17:51.471
- WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN?

17:51.504 --> 17:53.473
- OKAY.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.217
"I LOVE YOU."

18:07.787 --> 18:09.756
"I LOVE YOU."

18:13.926 --> 18:17.397
"I LOVE YOU."

18:17.430 --> 18:20.633
WELL, I HAVE
A MESSAGE FOR YOU.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.335
THANK YOU
FOR LOVING ME.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.871
- YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.906
- AND FOR BEING CONCERNED.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.108
- ANY TIME.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.614
WHAT?

18:34.647 --> 18:35.682
DO I HAVE A ZIT?

18:35.715 --> 18:37.750
- [chuckles]

18:37.784 --> 18:38.751
- IS THERE SOMETHING
CAUGHT IN MY TEETH?

18:38.785 --> 18:41.621
- NO.

18:41.654 --> 18:44.824
- THEN...
WHY ARE YOU STARING?

18:46.293 --> 18:48.628
- I'M JUST LOOKING.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.531
- FOR ANYTHING
IN PARTICULAR?

18:51.564 --> 18:53.500
- THE IMPERFECTION.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.435
- OH.

18:56.703 --> 18:57.904
THERE ARE PLENTY,
BELIEVE ME.

18:57.937 --> 19:01.508
- I DON'T SEE ANY.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.510
- IT'S THE LIGHTING.
TRUST ME, THEY'RE THERE.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.712
- [chuckles]

19:05.745 --> 19:08.815
I HAVE A FEW MYSELF.

19:10.450 --> 19:13.253
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.722
I'LL OVERLOOK YOURS
IF YOU OVERLOOK MINE.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.461
- DEAL.
[chuckles]

19:21.494 --> 19:23.430
LET'S EAT.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.801
- I'VE BEEN FAIR.
I'VE BEEN MORE THAN FAIR.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.871
EVEN GAVE UP MY CUSTODY
UNTIL SHE'S MUCH OLDER.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.840
THIS IS GOING TOO FAR.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.944
- THIS SHIT'S REALLY MELLOW.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.879
TRY SOME.

19:42.982 --> 19:46.719
- I MEAN, THERE'S ONLY SO FAR
YOU CAN BEND BEFORE YOU BREAK.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.488
- [laughs]

19:48.521 --> 19:50.557
I LIKE THAT ONE.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.625
DID YOU JUST
MAKE THAT UP?

19:52.659 --> 19:55.728
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS.

19:55.762 --> 19:58.898
- THE WAY I FIGURE,
IT'S JUST A FREE TRIP TO RIO.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.301
- HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT?

20:01.334 --> 20:03.570
ALL THOSE
FREQUENT-FLIER MILES.

20:03.603 --> 20:04.871
- YEAH, LIKE I CAN
SEE YOU ON A PLANE

20:04.904 --> 20:07.006
EVERY WEEKEND
TO TORONTO.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.576
- [sighs]
NO.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.345
BUT I CAN SEE YOU.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.981
LIKE THEY SAID, IT'S JUST
A HOP, SKIP, AND A JUMP.

20:15.014 --> 20:18.485
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.787
- FINE. LET'S TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.325
PSHH.

20:25.358 --> 20:29.396
WHAT SHOULD I WEAR
TO MY WEDDING?

20:29.429 --> 20:31.464
MY MOM WANTS ME TO WEAR
THE GOWN SHE WORE,

20:31.498 --> 20:32.899
BUT...

20:32.932 --> 20:35.502
LET'S FACE IT,
SHE NEVER HAD MUCH LUCK.

20:35.535 --> 20:38.004
- IT REALLY WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU,
WOULD IT, IF THEY MOVED AWAY?

20:38.037 --> 20:41.408
IF YOU NEVER SAW
YOUR SON AGAIN.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.910
- HE'S WITH HIS TWO MOMS.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.779
THEY'RE BACK
TOGETHER AGAIN.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.781
ONE BIG, HAPPY FAMILY.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.455
[sighs]

20:57.990 --> 20:59.292
SO EVEN IF IT
WILL CAUSE ME

20:59.326 --> 21:01.361
A MOMENTARY TWINGE
OF REGRET

21:01.394 --> 21:05.798
ON THE RARE OCCASION
THAT I THINK OF HIM...

21:05.832 --> 21:07.800
I'D SAY,

21:07.834 --> 21:09.769
HE'LL BE BETTER OFF.

21:09.802 --> 21:13.706
- YEAH, WELL, YOU WERE
NEVER MUCH IN HIS LIFE, ANYWAY.

21:16.709 --> 21:20.413
- NO, I NEVER WAS.

21:25.084 --> 21:28.988
[indistinct chatter]

21:38.565 --> 21:40.667
- HOW GOOD WAS THAT?

21:40.700 --> 21:43.069
I JUST LOVE DREW.
[chuckles] ALL RIGHT.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.437
[laughs]

21:44.471 --> 21:46.539
- CONGRATULATIONS, BABY!
- THANKS.

21:46.573 --> 21:49.342
- FIRST WIN IN WEEKS,
THANKS TO YOU.

21:49.376 --> 21:50.677
- THAT WAS SOME GAME.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.612
GOSH, YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY...
- AWESOME, DUDE!

21:52.645 --> 21:54.414
- I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU GUYS COMING TO CHEER ME ON.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.948
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

21:55.982 --> 21:58.017
EVEN AN AB FAB MARATHON
WOULDN'T KEEP ME AWAY.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.952
OH, WAIT, HONEY,
LAST THING YOU NEED

21:59.986 --> 22:00.953
IS TO GO OUT THERE
WITH LIPSTICK ON.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.455
[laughter]

22:02.489 --> 22:03.856
- WHEN YOU SCORED
THE WINNING TOUCHDOWN,

22:03.890 --> 22:05.425
THE FANS WENT NUTS.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.893
- YEAH, EXCEPT
FOR A COUPLE NAME-CALLERS.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.495
BUT DEB TOLD THEM
TO SHUT THE FUCK UP,

22:08.528 --> 22:10.497
OR SHE'D SHOVE THEIR BUDWEISERS
UP THEIR BUTTS.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.432
- HA!
AND THAT IS A DIRECT QUOTE.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.833
- [laughs]
THAT'S GREAT.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.835
- SO YOU CATCH
THAT GUY WITH BOYD?

22:15.868 --> 22:16.903
- OH, YOU MEAN
HIS TIGHT END?

22:16.936 --> 22:19.472
[laughter]

22:19.506 --> 22:20.473
- EXCUSE ME?

22:20.507 --> 22:24.611
- JUST LET IT GO.

22:24.644 --> 22:27.714
- IF YOU GUYS WANT TO CONTINUE
YOUR FIVE-GAME LOSING STREAK,

22:27.747 --> 22:29.782
I CAN PLAY
FOR ANOTHER TEAM.

22:29.816 --> 22:31.484
I'M SURE
THEY WOULDN'T MIND WINNING.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.985
IF YOU WANT A SHOT
AT THE SUPER BOWL,

22:33.019 --> 22:34.887
NOT TO MENTION
ALL THE BONUSES

22:34.921 --> 22:37.123
AND ENDORSEMENTS
AND PERKS,

22:37.156 --> 22:40.927
I SUGGEST YOU KEEP
YOUR MOUTHS SHUT.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.729
- [sighs]
SORRY, DREW.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.864
- IT WAS JUST A JOKE.

22:44.897 --> 22:45.865
- GREAT GAME.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.868
- YEAH, GREAT GAME.

22:48.901 --> 22:49.936
- DREW,
PHIL JENSON,

22:49.969 --> 22:51.170
CHANNEL 5 NEWS.
- AWESOME, DUDE.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.472
- DO YOU THINK
YOUR PERFORMANCE TONIGHT

22:52.505 --> 22:54.441
WILL PUT TO BED
ANY RUMORS...

23:00.713 --> 23:02.915
- I LIKE THE MINIMALIST
DIRECTION YOUR WORK'S TAKING.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.417
- [chuckles]

23:04.451 --> 23:06.953
LUCKILY, YOU'RE NOT
AN ART CRITIC.

23:06.986 --> 23:09.956
IT'S THE SEATING CHART
FOR OUR WEDDING DINNER.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.158
- OH.

23:12.191 --> 23:15.662
- HOMO, LESBIAN,
HOMO, LESBIAN,

23:15.695 --> 23:18.197
HOMO, LESBIAN.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.033
I HOPE MEL AND LINZ DON'T
LEAVE TOWN BEFORE THE WEDDING.

23:21.067 --> 23:24.504
IT'LL FUCK UP
MY ENTIRE SEATING ARRANGEMENT.

23:24.537 --> 23:27.540
- SOMETHING TELLS ME
THEY'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

23:29.676 --> 23:31.644
POPE MICHAEL IS NEVER

23:31.678 --> 23:33.780
GONNA GIVE HIS BLESSING.

23:33.813 --> 23:36.048
- I'D HATE NOT
SEEING THEM.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.685
OR THE KIDS,
ESPECIALLY GUS.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.187
I WAS THERE
THE NIGHT HE WAS BORN.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.189
I EVEN NAMED HIM.

23:43.222 --> 23:45.191
- I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.
- I'M NOT SURPRISED.

23:45.224 --> 23:47.994
YOU WERE STONED
OUT OF YOUR MIND.

23:50.162 --> 23:51.698
- AND YET
I HAVE A VIVID MEMORY

23:51.731 --> 23:52.932
OF THE SUBSEQUENT EVENTS.

23:52.965 --> 23:55.568
- [chuckles]
I'M SURE YOU DO.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.441
- WHAT THE FUCK?

24:03.976 --> 24:06.846
IT'S THEIR LIVES.

24:06.879 --> 24:09.015
IT'S THEIR DECISION.

24:09.048 --> 24:11.083
- YOU KNOW,
YOU AMAZE ME.

24:11.117 --> 24:14.253
HE'S YOUR SON, AND YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE YOU DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

24:14.286 --> 24:18.257
- THEY'RE HIS PARENTS, NOT ME.
I'M JUST...

24:18.290 --> 24:22.161
- AN UNCREDITED
GUEST APPEARANCE, I KNOW.

24:22.194 --> 24:24.831
YOU SHOULD GIVE YOURSELF
MORE CREDIT.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.232
I SEE HOW YOU ARE
WHEN YOU'RE WITH HIM.

24:26.265 --> 24:28.768
IT'S LIKE NOBODY ELSE
ON EARTH EXISTS.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.236
AND WHEN HE
LOOKS AT YOU...

24:30.269 --> 24:32.271
- YOU KNOW,
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD SEAT

24:32.304 --> 24:34.273
YOUR MOM'S BOYFRIEND
NEXT TO DEBBIE,

24:34.306 --> 24:36.976
UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING
TO SCARE HIM AWAY.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.979
- WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME?
ARE YOU LISTENING?

24:40.012 --> 24:42.248
- YEAH, I'M LISTENING.

24:42.281 --> 24:43.650
- YOU'RE NOT YOUR FATHER.

24:43.683 --> 24:46.285
YOU LOVE YOUR SON.

24:46.318 --> 24:49.622
NOW, WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE FOR
YOU TO ADMIT IT, ANOTHER BOMB?

24:56.328 --> 24:58.898
- I'M GONNA GO
TAKE A SHOWER.

25:02.001 --> 25:04.737
- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT BAGS LEFT UNATTENDED.

25:04.771 --> 25:07.073
WELL, I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA
BLOW UP THE FUCKING DINER.

25:07.106 --> 25:08.875
SHOWS HOW PARANOID
YOU CAN GET.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.610
ANY MORE ZITI FOR ANYONE?
MICHAEL?

25:10.643 --> 25:12.044
- NO, THANKS.

25:12.078 --> 25:14.547
- YOU DID THE RIGHT THING,
SWEETHEART.

25:14.581 --> 25:16.282
UNTIL WE CATCH
WHOEVER PLANTED THAT BOMB,

25:16.315 --> 25:18.017
YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.886
- IT'S NO WONDER MEL AND LINZ
WANT TO MOVE AWAY.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.220
- WELL, I DON'T CARE
WHAT THE REASON IS.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.089
YOU DON'T SPLIT UP FAMILY.

25:23.122 --> 25:25.758
AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO THAT.
PERIOD.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.059
HEY!

25:27.093 --> 25:28.695
WE DON'T GRAB
IN THIS HOUSE.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.563
WE STAND UP,

25:30.597 --> 25:33.199
BEND OVER, AND REACH.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.170
- ARE YOU SAYING YOU THINK
IT'S OKAY IF THEY TAKE J.R.?

25:38.204 --> 25:40.306
- NO, NO.

25:40.339 --> 25:42.308
BUT CONSIDERING WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THIS COUNTRY...

25:42.341 --> 25:43.576
- AT THE RISK

25:43.610 --> 25:45.978
OF SOUNDING UNPOPULAR,

25:46.012 --> 25:47.179
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

25:47.213 --> 25:50.817
- YEAH, FOR YOU.
YOU'RE NOT GAY.

25:50.850 --> 25:54.954
- I DON'T SEE WHERE YOU GUYS
GOT SUCH A RAW DEAL EITHER.

25:54.987 --> 25:57.089
- TELL THAT TO THE FAMILIES
OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED.

25:57.123 --> 25:59.926
IF MICHAEL HADN'T BEEN SO LUCKY,
I'M SURE YOU'D FEEL DIFFERENT.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.794
- I'M NOT SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE
A REASON TO BE CONCERNED.

26:01.828 --> 26:05.197
IF I WAS GAY AND I HAD KIDS,
I'D BE WORRIED TOO.

26:05.231 --> 26:08.234
BUT YOU GOTTA
HAVE FAITH.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.369
THE WIND CHANGES,
THE TIDE TURNS.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.238
- WHILE YOU'RE WAITING
FOR THE WIND AND THE TIDE,

26:12.271 --> 26:14.941
I SAY YOU'VE GOTTA STAND UP
FOR YOURSELF, LIKE DREW DID.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.208
THAT WAS TOTALLY AWESOME.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.810
- WELL, IF IT'S
SO TOTALLY AWESOME,

26:17.844 --> 26:19.011
MAYBE YOU COULD
TAKE A LESSON.

26:19.045 --> 26:20.747
- TOO SKINNY
TO PLAY FOOTBALL.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.849
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.083
CARL, HONEY,
THERE'S A CHICKEN BREAST

26:24.116 --> 26:26.986
RIGHT HERE
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.690
- BABY,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

26:30.723 --> 26:32.959
- YOU'RE AWFUL QUIET,
SWEETHEART.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.360
IF YOU'RE TIRED,
WHY DON'T YOU GO UPSTAIRS

26:34.393 --> 26:36.696
AND LIE DOWN?
- IT'S OKAY, MA. UM...

26:36.729 --> 26:38.631
[clears throat]
I'M FINE.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.303
- OKAY, WHO'S READY
FOR ICE CREAM?

26:44.336 --> 26:47.740
[rock music]

26:47.774 --> 26:49.842
- REMEMBER THAT CRITIC
FROM ART FORUM,

26:49.876 --> 26:51.744
THE ONE YOU THOUGHT
WAS THAT OTHER C-WORD?

26:51.778 --> 26:52.745
- [chuckles]

26:52.779 --> 26:54.113
SIMON WHAT'S-HIS-NAME?

26:54.146 --> 26:57.149
- HE WROTE AN ENTIRE ARTICLE
ABOUT YOU.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.419
- SO?

27:00.452 --> 27:03.990
- SO DO YOU REALIZE
HOW MUCH BUZZ THIS HAS CREATED?

27:04.023 --> 27:04.991
I MEAN,
I'M ALREADY GETTING CALLS

27:05.024 --> 27:06.058
FROM GALLERIES, COLLECTORS.

27:06.092 --> 27:08.795
- THAT'S NICE.

27:08.828 --> 27:11.197
- NICE.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.933
ARTISTS WORK FOR YEARS,
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES,

27:13.966 --> 27:16.135
AND NEVER GET
THIS KIND OF ATTENTION.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.670
CRITICS ARE RAVING
ABOUT YOU.

27:17.704 --> 27:19.872
PEOPLE WANT
TO BUY YOUR WORK.

27:19.906 --> 27:20.873
- GREAT.

27:20.907 --> 27:23.943
YOU CAN SELL IT
TO THEM.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.878
- WELL, THAT'S TRUE,
I COULD.

27:25.912 --> 27:28.414
BUT THIS IS A CHANCE
FOR YOU TO MOVE UP.

27:28.447 --> 27:29.882
TAKE THE NEXT STEP.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.751
- WHERE?

27:31.784 --> 27:33.019
- NEW YORK.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.754
- [laughs]
- NO, I'M SERIOUS.

27:34.787 --> 27:35.955
IT'S THE CENTER
OF THE ART WORLD.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.289
- YEAH, I KNOW.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.225
IF I CAN MAKE IT THERE,
I CAN MAKE IT ANYWHERE.

27:39.258 --> 27:40.693
- YOU'VE PRACTICALLY
MADE IT ALREADY.

27:40.727 --> 27:42.161
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO NOW
IS SHOW UP.

27:42.194 --> 27:45.698
- I CAN PAINT
IN PITTSBURGH.

27:45.732 --> 27:47.466
- YOU THINK WARHOL
WOULD HAVE BECOME WARHOL

27:47.499 --> 27:49.168
IF HE'D STAYED HERE?

27:49.201 --> 27:51.170
- IF IT'S SO IMPORTANT,
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO?

27:51.203 --> 27:53.940
- BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE
YOUR TALENT.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.842
- [sighs]

27:55.875 --> 27:57.844
I KNOW HOW MUCH
THIS MEANS TO YOU,

27:57.877 --> 27:58.978
HOW MUCH
YOU BELIEVE IN ME.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.047
YOU ALWAYS HAVE.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.450
BUT NEW YORK ISN'T
MY OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.863
WHAT'S THE "THUMPA-THUMPA"?

- YES, HIS FLAME
BURNS BRIGHT.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.340
BUT DON'T LET THAT
FOOL YOU.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.409
IF IT WEREN'T FOR HIM...

30:46.145 --> 30:47.479
I WOULDN'T BE HERE
WITH YOU TONIGHT.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.481
- I'D LIKE TO GET
TO KNOW HIM.

30:49.515 --> 30:51.350
- I'D LIKE YOU TO KNOW
ALL MY FRIENDS,

30:51.383 --> 30:53.886
MICHAEL, BEN...

30:53.920 --> 30:56.355
EVEN BRIAN.
OH, AND YOU WILL.

30:56.388 --> 30:57.623
THEY'LL ALL BE
AT MY BIRTHDAY BASH.

30:57.656 --> 30:59.491
- YOUR BIRTHDAY BASH.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.961
I HAVE TO THINK OF SOMETHING
TOTALLY AMAZING TO GET YOU.

31:01.994 --> 31:03.295
- YOU ALREADY HAVE.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.965
- * ALL FAR AND WIDE

31:05.998 --> 31:09.035
* YOU GOTTA SAY,
"I'M ME" *

31:09.068 --> 31:11.503
* PRIDE FOR THE WORLD
TO SEE *

31:11.537 --> 31:15.407
* INDIVIDUALITY

31:15.441 --> 31:17.109
*

31:17.143 --> 31:19.979
* TAKE PRIDE

31:20.012 --> 31:24.183
* IN WHO YOU REALLY ARE
INSIDE *

31:24.216 --> 31:26.919
* DON'T HIDE

31:26.953 --> 31:29.388
* MAKE THE WORLD TO SEE

31:29.421 --> 31:31.257
* WHO YOU'RE MEANT TO BE

31:31.290 --> 31:33.525
* TAKE PRIDE

31:33.559 --> 31:37.329
* SPREAD THE NEWS
ALL FAR AND WIDE *

31:37.363 --> 31:40.132
* YOU GOTTA SAY,
"I'M ME" *

31:40.166 --> 31:45.004
* I'M ME, I'M ME,
I'M ME *

31:45.037 --> 31:49.942
* I'M ME,
I'M ME, I'M ME *

31:49.976 --> 31:54.680
* I'M ME, I'M ME

31:54.713 --> 31:57.316
- I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE ASKED.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.418
UM, IN FACT,

31:59.451 --> 32:02.554
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.

32:02.588 --> 32:06.092
AND SO FAR, I'VE COME UP WITH
ABOUT A THOUSAND GOOD REASONS

32:06.125 --> 32:10.296
WHY MOVING TO CANADA
IS A LOUSY IDEA.

32:10.329 --> 32:11.563
I'D BE AWAY
FROM MY DAUGHTER.

32:11.597 --> 32:14.433
SHE'D BE RAISED
IN ANOTHER COUNTRY.

32:14.466 --> 32:16.702
WE WOULDN'T BE
IN EACH OTHER'S LIVES.

32:16.735 --> 32:21.040
SO ALL THINGS
BEING EQUAL,

32:21.073 --> 32:24.110
THERE'S JUST NO WAY
I CAN GO ALONG WITH IT.

32:26.545 --> 32:29.581
- WE FIGURED AS MUCH.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.117
- HOWEVER...

32:34.286 --> 32:37.356
ALL THINGS AREN'T EQUAL.

32:37.389 --> 32:40.559
AT LEAST NOT HERE,
NOT FOR US.

32:42.094 --> 32:45.998
AND DESPITE
MY PERSONAL OBJECTIONS,

32:46.032 --> 32:50.736
IF YOU WANT TO LIVE IN A PLACE
WHERE GUS AND J.R. WILL BE SAFE,

32:50.769 --> 32:53.339
WHERE THEY ACCEPT
AND RESPECT GAY PEOPLE,

32:53.372 --> 32:56.975
WHERE THEY'LL HAVE THE SAME
RIGHTS AS EVERYBODY ELSE...

33:02.248 --> 33:03.749
THEN I GIVE YOU
MY BLESSING.

33:03.782 --> 33:06.752
- [chuckles]
- [sighs]

33:06.785 --> 33:09.688
- THANK YOU, MICHAEL.

33:09.721 --> 33:12.358
- YES, MICHAEL.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.226
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR BLESSING.

33:14.260 --> 33:16.195
[Melanie sighs]

33:18.530 --> 33:22.134
- IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE,
I HAVE NO PROBLEM.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.671
YOU HAVE MY BLESSING TOO.

33:29.408 --> 33:32.111
BUT GUS STAYS HERE.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.112
- WHAT?

33:33.145 --> 33:35.047
- GUS STAYS HERE.

33:39.085 --> 33:40.319
- BUT WE ASSUMED...

33:40.352 --> 33:43.255
- THAT I'D GIVE YOU
MY CONSENT.

33:43.289 --> 33:46.392
THAT I'D SAY,
"SURE, TAKE MY SON.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.594
FLEE THE COUNTRY."

33:48.627 --> 33:52.464
THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF LESSON
I WANT YOU TEACHING HIM,

33:52.498 --> 33:54.266
TO RUN AWAY FROM A BULLY...
- [scoffs]

33:54.300 --> 33:58.404
- AND TO BE AFRAID
TO STAND UP AND FIGHT.

33:58.437 --> 34:02.608
- I HAVE NEVER RUN AWAY
FROM A BULLY,

34:02.641 --> 34:04.276
AND I HAVE FOUGHT
FOR GAY RIGHTS

34:04.310 --> 34:06.612
MORE THAN YOU HAVE
OR EVER WILL.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.080
BUT WE HAVE AN INFANT

34:08.114 --> 34:10.216
AND A LITTLE BOY
DEPENDING ON US.

34:10.249 --> 34:11.417
AND THEIR LIVES
COME FIRST.

34:11.450 --> 34:12.818
SO DON'T YOU
DARE ACCUSE ME

34:12.851 --> 34:14.420
OF TEACHING YOUR SON
THE WRONG LESSONS

34:14.453 --> 34:16.488
WHEN YOU HAVEN'T TAUGHT HIM
A GODDAMN THING!

34:16.522 --> 34:17.689
- MEL, PLEASE.

34:17.723 --> 34:20.626
- DON'T TELL ME "PLEASE."

34:20.659 --> 34:22.294
THE--THE WINNER
FOUR YEARS IN A ROW

34:22.328 --> 34:23.695
OF THE DISINTERESTED DAD
AWARD

34:23.729 --> 34:25.097
SUDDENLY DECIDES
HE CARES ABOUT HIS SON,

34:25.131 --> 34:26.632
SO WE CAN'T LEAVE?

34:26.665 --> 34:30.502
- WE ASKED
FOR THEIR BLESSING,

34:30.536 --> 34:34.173
AND HE HAS A RIGHT
NOT TO GIVE IT.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.775
- [sighs]

34:40.812 --> 34:43.249
- HOW'S MY FAVORITE
STUD MUFFIN,

34:43.282 --> 34:46.118
EXCEPT FOR CARL HORVATH,
OF COURSE?

34:46.152 --> 34:48.220
YEAH, HOLD ON.

34:50.622 --> 34:52.624
EMMETT.

34:55.694 --> 34:58.597
UM, HE'S NOT HERE
RIGHT NOW.

34:58.630 --> 35:01.233
WHEN WILL HE BE BACK?

35:05.237 --> 35:07.206
[whispers] WHAT THE FUCK'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO BE?

35:07.239 --> 35:08.340
- [whispers]
BUSY!

35:08.374 --> 35:10.809
- BUS--

35:10.842 --> 35:14.380
HE'S BUSY.
YEAH, VERY BUSY.

35:15.514 --> 35:17.616
HE'LL...
CALL...

35:17.649 --> 35:19.751
YOU.

35:19.785 --> 35:22.554
[sighs]
BYE-BYE.

35:22.588 --> 35:23.789
[slams phone]

35:23.822 --> 35:24.790
IF I WANT TO BE
A FUCKING INTERPRETER,

35:24.823 --> 35:26.492
I'D WORK AT THE U.N.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.527
- WELL, I'M SORRY TO PUT YOU
THROUGH THAT, DEB,

35:28.560 --> 35:30.762
BUT I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF SPEAKING TO MR. BOYD

35:30.796 --> 35:32.564
AFTER THAT DISGUSTING DISPLAY.

35:32.598 --> 35:36.435
- WELL, THEN,
DUMP THESE FOR ME, WILL YOU?

35:39.705 --> 35:41.940
- AND AFTER I
STUCK BY HIM.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.242
- FOR CHRIST'S SAKES,

35:43.275 --> 35:44.643
WOULD YOU GIVE
THE GUY A BREAK?

35:44.676 --> 35:46.545
HE'S 17.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.947
- I'LL ADMIT HE LOOKS AMAZING,
BUT ACTUALLY, HE'S 33.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.517
- YEAH, IF YOU'RE COUNTING
CHRONOLOGICALLY,

35:51.550 --> 35:54.553
BUT EMOTIONALLY,
HE'S PRACTICALLY A BABY.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.255
HE'S A KID
IN A CANDY STORE.

35:56.288 --> 35:57.723
HE JUST WANTS TO LICK
EVERY PEPPERMINT STICK

35:57.756 --> 35:59.791
HE CAN GET HIS HANDS ON.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.527
EVENTUALLY
HE'LL GROW UP,

36:01.560 --> 36:04.963
BUT FIRST HE HAS TO RELIVE
HIS ADOLESCENCE.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.665
- SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
IN THE MEANTIME,

36:06.698 --> 36:07.799
TWIDDLE MY THUMBS?

36:07.833 --> 36:10.702
- OR WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.538
BUT FORGIVE HIM
HIS YOUTH.

36:12.571 --> 36:15.707
REMEMBER, YOU WERE ONCE
A GAY YOUNG THING YOURSELF.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.818
- MEL?

36:26.852 --> 36:27.819
- SORRY I WOKE YOU.

36:27.853 --> 36:29.421
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

36:29.455 --> 36:32.224
I COULDN'T SLEEP EITHER.

36:32.258 --> 36:33.292
YOU WANT
SOME TEA AND HONEY?

36:33.325 --> 36:35.494
- MAKE MINE ARSENIC.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.496
- IT'S NOT WORTH
KILLING YOURSELF OVER.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.565
- NOT FOR ME.
FOR HIM.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.333
- GUS IS HIS SON TOO.

36:41.367 --> 36:42.834
WHAT'S THIS?

36:42.868 --> 36:45.871
- UH, IT'S A LETTER
MY GRANDFATHER WROTE ME

36:45.904 --> 36:48.907
WHEN I GOT
INTO LAW SCHOOL.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.445
"MY DEAREST RACHALAH..."

36:53.479 --> 36:55.514
THAT'S, UH, YIDDISH
FOR RACHAEL.

36:55.547 --> 36:59.318
HE LIKED
MY MIDDLE NAME.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.720
"YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW PROUD I AM,

37:01.753 --> 37:04.790
"TO THINK THAT ONE DAY
MY GRANDDAUGHTER

37:04.823 --> 37:08.894
WILL BE THE FIRST JEWISH WOMAN
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE."

37:08.927 --> 37:11.797
ZAIDEH ALWAYS
DREAMED BIG.

37:11.830 --> 37:14.266
"I HOPE YOU KNOW
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE

37:14.300 --> 37:17.035
"TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE
EVERYONE HAS THE SAME RIGHT

37:17.068 --> 37:22.874
"TO LIVE HIS LIFE FREE
OF INTOLERANCE AND OPPRESSION.

37:22.908 --> 37:26.878
"IT'S WHY I CAME HERE
SO MANY YEARS AGO.

37:26.912 --> 37:29.548
BE GRATEFUL
YOU ARE AN AMERICAN."

37:32.784 --> 37:36.254
I WONDER WHAT HE'D SAY IF HE
KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON NOW.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.492
- "THE HPS SENTINEL SYSTEM

37:40.526 --> 37:42.428
"WILL NOT ONLY GIVE YOU
PEACE OF MIND,

37:42.461 --> 37:44.296
"IT WILL ALSO LOWER
YOUR HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE

37:44.330 --> 37:45.964
AND IMPROVE THE VALUE
OF YOUR HOUSE."

37:45.997 --> 37:47.766
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
AT THAT FOR?

37:47.799 --> 37:49.301
- WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
IT'D BE WORTH CONSIDERING,

37:49.335 --> 37:50.936
YOU KNOW, JUST IN CASE.
- MM.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.971
YOU GOT ME
TO PROTECT YOU.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.040
[growling]
- OOH, OOH, OOH.

37:55.073 --> 37:58.043
WHY, MR. KENT,
YOU REALLY ARE SUPERMAN.

37:58.076 --> 37:59.711
- UH-HUH.

37:59.745 --> 38:00.912
- LATER.

38:00.946 --> 38:03.415
- WHOA, WHOA, PAL.
NO BREAKFAST?

38:03.449 --> 38:04.650
- CAN'T. LATE.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.918
- WORKING THE MORNING SHIFT?
- NOPE.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.387
- WELL,
IF YOUR GRANDMOTHER-GENERAL

38:08.420 --> 38:09.521
IS NOT GONNA
COURT-MARTIAL YOU,

38:09.555 --> 38:12.057
WHAT'S THE RUSH?
- SCHOOL.

38:12.090 --> 38:13.659
- [laughs]
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

38:13.692 --> 38:16.728
- DUDE, IF ONE EXPECTS
TO ACHIEVE GREATNESS,

38:16.762 --> 38:18.797
IT WON'T BE BY CLEANING THE
CRAPPER AT THE LIBERTY DINER.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.466
- A PROFOUND OBSERVATION.

38:20.499 --> 38:21.800
- I ADMIRE YOUR AMBITION,

38:21.833 --> 38:24.403
BUT YOU'VE MISSED
A LOT OF CLASSES.

38:24.436 --> 38:27.105
- THEN YOU BETTER
START BONING UP...

38:27.138 --> 38:28.940
SINCE YOU'LL BE HELPING ME.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.108
- HEY.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.577
UH...

38:31.610 --> 38:34.813
[clears throat]

38:34.846 --> 38:37.082
DON'T LET THE KIDS
AT SCHOOL GET TO YOU.

38:37.115 --> 38:41.487
- IF A PUSSY LIKE DREW BOYD
CAN DEAL WITH IT, SO CAN I.

38:42.654 --> 38:43.855
- SMARTASS.

38:50.529 --> 38:52.698
[children shouting]

38:52.731 --> 38:54.099
- [chuckles]

38:54.132 --> 38:56.101
- OVER HERE!
- [laughs]

38:56.134 --> 38:58.637
- WHEN DID HE LEARN
TO THROW LIKE THAT?

38:58.670 --> 39:01.607
- OH,
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO.

39:04.610 --> 39:07.379
- I MUST HAVE BEEN WORKING.

39:07.413 --> 39:08.980
- OR SOMETHING.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.950
- WELL, ALL THAT'S
ABOUT TO CHANGE.

39:13.952 --> 39:17.423
NO MORE BABYLON,
NO MORE LATE NIGHTS.

39:19.057 --> 39:22.360
JUST THE QUIET LIFE
OF A HAPPILY MARRIED MAN.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.164
- DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

39:26.197 --> 39:29.601
THE "I DON'T CARE
WHAT THOSE SELF-LOATHING,

39:29.635 --> 39:31.903
"HYPOCRITICAL FAGS THINK,
IT'S MY LIFE,

39:31.937 --> 39:34.606
AND I'LL FUCK
WHOEVER I WANT"

39:34.640 --> 39:37.543
BRIAN KINNEY
I KNOW AND LOVE.

39:40.979 --> 39:43.615
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
TAMING A HORSE.

39:43.649 --> 39:45.150
- HMM.

39:45.183 --> 39:47.486
WELL, LET'S HOPE
I DON'T END UP LIKE TRIGGER.

39:47.519 --> 39:50.422
- [laughs]
OH, DID YOU SEE THIS?

39:51.923 --> 39:55.661
JUSTIN'S PROBABLY
TOO MODEST TO SHOW YOU.

39:57.829 --> 40:00.432
YEP.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.668
- THAT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

40:04.570 --> 40:08.707
- HE SAYS THE HOUSE YOU BOUGHT
IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE TOO.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.544
SWIMMING POOL, STABLE.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.814
- HE'S GONNA HAVE
A FUCKING FABULOUS TIME

40:15.847 --> 40:18.850
WHEN HE COMES
AND VISITS HIS OLD MAN.

40:18.884 --> 40:20.686
- HE COULD STILL HAVE
A FABULOUS TIME

40:20.719 --> 40:23.789
WHEN HE VISITS HIS OLD MAN
DURING THE SUMMER.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.957
[children shouting]

40:27.493 --> 40:30.929
YOU KNOW,
KEEPING US HERE...

40:30.962 --> 40:33.899
ISN'T GONNA MAKE UP
FOR LOST OPPORTUNITIES.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.439
- WELL, I WANT
ANOTHER CHANCE.

40:42.708 --> 40:44.943
I WANT HIM
TO KNOW WHO I AM.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.713
- HE WILL.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.585
- I DON'T WANT HIM
TO FORGET ME.

40:53.619 --> 40:54.586
- HE WON'T.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.988
WE'LL MAKE SURE OF THAT.

41:01.927 --> 41:04.863
- HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE
I'M GONNA BE LOSING.

41:07.933 --> 41:11.102
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GO, WENDY.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.071
- I HAVE TO, PETER.

41:23.682 --> 41:26.652
- INDIAN FOOD
FIT FOR A RAJAH.

41:26.685 --> 41:28.019
- THAT WAS QUICK.

41:28.053 --> 41:30.155
- WELL,
THERE'S A NEW TAKEOUT PLACE,

41:30.188 --> 41:32.858
"CURRY IN A HURRY."

41:32.891 --> 41:36.161
YOUR ORDER'S READY QUICKER THAN
YOU CAN SAY "CHICKEN VINDALOO."

41:37.295 --> 41:38.597
WHAT YOU LOOKING AT?

41:38.630 --> 41:39.765
- NOTHING.

41:39.798 --> 41:43.602
- COME ON, LET ME SEE.

41:43.635 --> 41:45.537
LET ME SEE.
LET--

41:47.806 --> 41:49.174
LET--

41:49.207 --> 41:51.176
GIVE--

41:51.209 --> 41:53.612
COME ON, AND DOWN.

41:53.645 --> 41:54.913
AND OPEN.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.648
MOUNT FLAME?

41:56.682 --> 41:58.149
- I'M TAKING YOU
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.318
- [sighs]
- [laughs]

42:00.351 --> 42:02.220
IT'S GAY SKI WEEK.

42:02.253 --> 42:04.289
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT.

42:04.322 --> 42:07.959
- I WANT YOU TO HAVE
THE BEST BIRTHDAY EVER.

42:07.993 --> 42:10.929
- YOU MAKE IT
MY BEST BIRTHDAY EVER.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.067
- WELL,
THINK OF HOW MUCH FUN IT'LL BE

42:16.101 --> 42:17.335
SCHUSSING DOWN
THE SLOPES.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.771
- EVEN THOUGH
I DON'T SKI.

42:19.805 --> 42:20.972
- SIPPING HOT TODDIES.

42:21.006 --> 42:22.908
- EVEN THOUGH
I DON'T DRINK.

42:22.941 --> 42:25.844
- CUDDLING IN FRONT OF THE FIRE,
AFTER WE'VE MADE LOVE.

42:25.877 --> 42:28.747
- AH, THAT IS
SOMETHING I DO.

42:35.754 --> 42:36.788
WHEN DO WE GO?

42:36.822 --> 42:38.189
- A WEEK FROM FRIDAY.

42:38.223 --> 42:41.593
- A WEEK FR--OH, WE CAN'T.
- WHY NOT?

42:41.627 --> 42:42.994
- WELL, THAT'S THE NIGHT
OF MY BIRTHDAY DINNER, REMEMBER?

42:43.028 --> 42:46.765
- I DIDN'T FORGET.
I CALLED THE RESTAURANT.

42:48.233 --> 42:50.168
YOU CAN CANCEL IT
IF YOU WANT.

42:51.770 --> 42:53.204
YOU CAN EVEN GET
YOUR DEPOSIT BACK.

42:53.238 --> 42:55.974
JUST ASK FOR...ROB.

42:57.275 --> 42:59.678
- I KNOW, BUT I INVITED
ALL MY FRIENDS.

42:59.711 --> 43:02.914
- TED, YOU CAN SEE
YOUR FRIENDS ANY TIME.

43:02.948 --> 43:04.249
THIS WILL BE A CHANCE FOR US
TO BE ALONE TOGETHER.

43:04.282 --> 43:05.250
I THOUGHT
YOU'D LIKE THAT.

43:05.283 --> 43:07.819
- I WOULD.

43:07.853 --> 43:10.789
- SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

43:15.727 --> 43:17.629
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE ISN'T ANY.

43:17.663 --> 43:19.130
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

43:19.164 --> 43:21.099
- THIS IS GONNA BE
THE MOST ROMANTIC WEEKEND

43:21.132 --> 43:25.003
YOU HAVE EVER HAD.

43:25.036 --> 43:27.639
JUST YOU AND ME,
IN OUR OWN LITTLE WORLD.

43:28.807 --> 43:30.876
- [sighs]

43:35.781 --> 43:37.115
[techno music]

43:37.148 --> 43:39.250
- I'LL HAVE A CUBA LIBRE
AND A VODKA TONIC.

43:39.284 --> 43:40.285
- COMING UP.

43:40.318 --> 43:44.890
*

43:44.923 --> 43:47.158
- I'M GLAD
YOU FINALLY CALLED.

43:49.094 --> 43:53.398
- I WAS UPSET.
I NEEDED SOME TIME.

43:53.431 --> 43:56.034
- I WANT YOU TO KNOW, THAT GUY
AT POPPERZ CAME ONTO ME.

43:56.067 --> 43:59.738
- YOU DIDN'T EXACTLY RESIST.

43:59.771 --> 44:02.808
ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO ADMIT,
HE HAD A CERTAIN TRASHY APPEAL.

44:05.911 --> 44:07.278
- VODKA ROCKS.

44:07.312 --> 44:09.881
- MM, YOU BETTER MAKE HIS
A SHIRLEY TEMPLE.

44:09.915 --> 44:11.950
HE'S UNDERAGE.

44:11.983 --> 44:15.053
- [laughs]
UNDER WHAT AGE?

44:15.086 --> 44:19.190
- THE AGE WHERE
YOU'VE BEEN THERE, DONE THAT.

44:19.224 --> 44:22.160
AND THAT AND THAT.
[chuckles]

44:22.193 --> 44:23.962
AS DEB ONCE SAID TO ME,

44:23.995 --> 44:27.198
"EM, YOU HAVE BEEN ON MORE
WIENERS THAN FRENCH'S MUSTARD."

44:27.232 --> 44:29.034
- [laughs]

44:29.067 --> 44:31.970
- BUT YOU...

44:32.003 --> 44:34.172
YOU'VE JUST BEEN BORN.

44:34.205 --> 44:37.308
YOU'RE NOT READY
FOR BOYFRIEND-HOOD.

44:37.342 --> 44:41.780
YOU GOT A WHOLE WORLD
IN FRONT OF YOU, AND...

44:41.813 --> 44:44.716
I DON'T WANT
TO BLOCK THE VIEW.

44:51.957 --> 44:53.024
- SORRY.

44:54.159 --> 44:55.794
- DON'T BE.

44:55.827 --> 44:57.328
AS THE PRESIDING GEEZER,
LET ME SAY

44:57.362 --> 44:59.464
THAT THIS IS YOUR TIME
TO EXPERIENCE

44:59.497 --> 45:02.400
EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE.

45:03.534 --> 45:05.236
SO ENJOY YOURSELF.

45:05.270 --> 45:07.873
SAFELY.

45:09.007 --> 45:11.242
- ONE SHIRLEY TEMPLE.

45:13.979 --> 45:15.280
- WHAT ABOUT US?

45:18.283 --> 45:20.485
- [sighs]
SOMEDAY WE'LL GET TOGETHER

45:20.518 --> 45:23.188
AND, UH, AND HAVE
A REAL DRINK.

45:24.790 --> 45:26.291
- WHEN WILL THAT BE?

45:29.560 --> 45:32.864
- CALL ME
ON YOUR 21ST BIRTHDAY.

45:38.069 --> 45:40.105
[glasses clink]

45:40.138 --> 45:48.079
*

46:07.465 --> 46:10.869
- YOU KNOW, YOUR IDEA OF
REGISTERING AT PRADA WAS GENIUS.

46:10.902 --> 46:12.403
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
THAT, UH,

46:12.437 --> 46:15.406
POTTERY BARN WOULD BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE USEFUL?

46:15.440 --> 46:18.877
- [laughs]
SHOES, SERVING BOWLS.

46:18.910 --> 46:20.912
SHOES, BLENDER.
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

46:20.946 --> 46:23.048
- [chuckles]

46:23.081 --> 46:24.950
- * ALL THE WALLS

46:24.983 --> 46:26.952
- [clears throat]

46:26.985 --> 46:28.453
"MR. TAYLOR'S
LARGE-SCALE CANVAS

46:28.486 --> 46:30.588
COMBINES THE HIGH-ENERGY
IMPULSIVENESS..."

46:30.621 --> 46:32.423
WHY, THAT'S A MOUTHFUL.

46:32.457 --> 46:34.292
"OF POLLOCK,

46:34.325 --> 46:37.896
PLUS THE ANALYTICAL
PAINTERLINESS..."

46:37.929 --> 46:40.465
HE LIKES BIG WORDS.
"OF JOHNS.

46:40.498 --> 46:42.834
"BUT WHAT MAKES
HIS TALENT UNIQUE

46:42.868 --> 46:44.903
"IS A QUALITY
THAT HASN'T BEEN SEEN

46:44.936 --> 46:46.872
"IN A LONG TIME...

46:48.106 --> 46:49.340

46:49.374 --> 46:52.077
- [laughs]

46:52.110 --> 46:55.313
- "NEW YORK IS WAITING
TO BE CONQUERED."

46:55.346 --> 46:57.248
THAT'S SOME REVIEW,
MR. TAYLOR.

46:57.282 --> 46:59.217
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY LINDSAY SHOWED YOU THAT.

46:59.250 --> 47:03.021
- BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T.

47:03.054 --> 47:04.455
- JUST BECAUSE
SOME ART SCENE FAIRY

47:04.489 --> 47:06.925
WHO PROBABLY ADMIRED MY ASS
A LOT MORE THAN MY WORK

47:06.958 --> 47:08.393
DECIDES TO WRITES
A FAWNING REVIEW

47:08.426 --> 47:09.995
DOESN'T MEAN
I SHOULD PACK MY BAGS

47:10.028 --> 47:11.362
AND GRAB
THE NEXT GREYHOUND.

47:11.396 --> 47:13.198
- HE COULD HAVE ADMIRED
YOUR ASS

47:13.231 --> 47:16.634
WITHOUT WRITING
A FAWNING REVIEW.

47:16.667 --> 47:19.370
AND YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN
ON A GREYHOUND IN YOUR LIFE.

47:19.404 --> 47:22.941
- NO, BUT I HAVE BEEN
TO HOLLYWOOD.

47:22.974 --> 47:24.609
THEY GUSHED TOO,
REMEMBER?

47:24.642 --> 47:26.344
MADE A BUNCH
OF BULLSHIT PROMISES.

47:26.377 --> 47:30.048
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK NEW YORK
WOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT?

47:32.450 --> 47:35.220
THE ONLY ONE WHO NEVER BROKE
A PROMISE WAS YOU.

47:35.253 --> 47:36.654
- * SHADES ON WINDOWS

47:36.687 --> 47:38.556
