WEBVTT

00:04.971 --> 00:06.839
Finch, you got anything else?

00:06.840 --> 00:09.474
That's about it.

00:09.475 --> 00:12.477
These are from Sex Crimes.

00:12.478 --> 00:14.746
- Thanks.
- We should

00:14.747 --> 00:16.982
get moving. Fiona's already in court.

00:16.983 --> 00:19.618
- Is Emma ready?
- I think so.

00:19.619 --> 00:21.987
- Good luck with that.
- What's that supposed to mean?

00:21.988 --> 00:23.956
Your witness. I'm just
saying, good luck.

00:23.957 --> 00:26.091
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

00:26.092 --> 00:28.327
What? She told the clinic to destroy

00:28.328 --> 00:30.329
- her rape kit, didn't she?
- No, she told them

00:30.330 --> 00:32.331
she wasn't filing a report
so they got rid of it.

00:32.332 --> 00:34.333
- But then she changed her mind.
- It's normal for victims

00:34.334 --> 00:36.335
of sexual assault to
change their mind, Aaron.

00:36.336 --> 00:38.337
Yeah, I know that. But let's
hope the jury does too.

00:38.338 --> 00:40.939
- What're you gettin' at, Finch?
- I'm just wondering

00:40.940 --> 00:43.642
if she's gonna do more harm
than good as a witness.

00:43.643 --> 00:46.211
Zach Graydon drugged,
raped and strangled

00:46.212 --> 00:48.180
that poor girl. You think we
should ignore her testimony

00:48.181 --> 00:50.449
- because of a missing kit?
- No! That's not what I meant.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.451
- So what did you mean?
- What'd you mean?

00:55.188 --> 00:58.457
Never mind. Why don't I
load these up for you?

00:58.458 --> 01:00.359
Yeah. Do that.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.095
- I'll go grab Emma.
- OK.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.032
Hey, Emma. How's the coffee today?

01:07.033 --> 01:10.802
- It's OK.
- Um... It's time to go.

01:12.705 --> 01:14.873
Do you have anyone coming with
you to court today? I mean,

01:14.874 --> 01:18.543
- your parents are coming, right?
- No. I haven't told them.

01:18.544 --> 01:21.546
Well, just stick to what you said

01:21.547 --> 01:23.682
in the preliminary inquiry
and you'll do great.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.951
Promise.

01:30.156 --> 01:32.157
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

01:32.158 --> 01:35.093
the case you'll be
hearing today is simple.

01:35.094 --> 01:38.096
On the evening of March the 15th

01:38.097 --> 01:40.165
last year, the accused,

01:40.166 --> 01:42.701
Zachary Graydon, drugged

01:42.702 --> 01:45.404
sexually assaulted and murdered

01:45.405 --> 01:48.507
by strangulation Beth Tremblay.

01:48.508 --> 01:51.009
A college student in the prime

01:51.010 --> 01:53.111
of her life,

01:53.112 --> 01:55.013
whose body he then

01:55.014 --> 01:58.183
re-dressed and abandoned

01:58.184 --> 02:01.586
into the recycling bins
of her dormitory residence.

02:01.587 --> 02:04.556
Now, some of you may already be
familiar with Mr. Graydon.

02:04.557 --> 02:07.659
Some of you may even...

02:07.660 --> 02:10.929
admire him. I mean, after all, he's

02:10.930 --> 02:13.865
a rising hockey star, a good student,

02:13.866 --> 02:16.601
a son, and a... friend to many.

02:16.602 --> 02:19.705
But I ask that you
look beyond appearances

02:19.706 --> 02:23.909
and pay attention to the facts.

02:23.910 --> 02:26.111
Because soon, we will be

02:26.112 --> 02:28.447
presenting you with
similar fact evidence

02:28.448 --> 02:30.382
from our witness,

02:30.383 --> 02:32.351
Ms. Emma Wright,

02:32.352 --> 02:35.787
who was also drugged...
sexually assaulted

02:35.788 --> 02:38.790
and left unconscious in a parking lot.

02:38.791 --> 02:41.994
Luckily, she survived.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.596
- Where's your witness?
- She's inside. Why?

02:44.597 --> 02:46.798
- Everything OK?
- The defence attorney's

02:46.799 --> 02:49.301
changed. Prelim attorney's now
junior counsel for the trial.

02:49.302 --> 02:51.970
- What? How?
- I guess they decided to bring

02:51.971 --> 02:54.139
- in the muscle. It happens.
- Great.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.375
I don't care if that kid
in there is the next Gretzky,

02:56.376 --> 02:58.510
we are not gonna make
this easy for him. OK?

03:00.279 --> 03:02.447
Who is the new attorney then,
for the defence?

03:02.448 --> 03:04.449
He's the guy
with all the hair product.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.451
What's his name? Marc Savage.
Yeah, I think

03:06.452 --> 03:08.620
that sounds right. Keep me posted.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:18.364 --> 03:21.099
Can you believe this?
You think he'd at least

03:21.100 --> 03:23.435
- have the decency to tell me.
- Because he's always been

03:23.436 --> 03:26.304
such a decent guy...

03:26.305 --> 03:28.974
Look, I think we should
tell the prosecution.

03:28.975 --> 03:31.043
Why? We're not doing anything illegal.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.645
- Still, it is not ideal.
- I'm gonna be on the stand

03:33.646 --> 03:36.148
in five minutes.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.617
Does he even know about the baby?

03:40.820 --> 03:43.822
- When are you gonna tell him?
- I don't know. OK? Soon.

03:43.823 --> 03:47.692
Whatever. It's fine. I'm gonna
go in there. I'm gonna testify,

03:47.693 --> 03:50.062
and I am going to destroy him.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.964
Don't worry about it! I got this.

03:55.668 --> 03:57.702
Detective Cooper, can you

03:57.703 --> 03:59.671
state what was present

03:59.672 --> 04:02.707
in Beth Tremblay's toxicology
report the morning of her death?

04:02.708 --> 04:04.976
High blood alcohol and Rohypnol.

04:04.977 --> 04:06.912
And why was the accused

04:06.913 --> 04:08.880
a significant person of interest

04:08.881 --> 04:11.316
- in relation to this report?
- He was the last one

04:11.317 --> 04:13.151
to be seen with her
and his credit card statement

04:13.152 --> 04:14.986
showed that he purchased her drink.

04:14.987 --> 04:16.954
And Detective, you had the opportunity

04:16.956 --> 04:18.824
to interview the accused, correct?

04:18.825 --> 04:21.526
- Yes. Twice.
- Could you speak

04:21.527 --> 04:23.528
to the two separate interviews

04:23.529 --> 04:25.530
where the accused
described the last time he saw.

04:25.531 --> 04:27.666
- Beth Tremblay?
- In his first interview,

04:27.667 --> 04:29.701
he stated that he dropped

04:29.702 --> 04:31.703
her off at her building
around midnight, leaving her

04:31.704 --> 04:33.905
standing out front,
searching for her keys.

04:33.906 --> 04:36.741
In his second statement, he said
that he actually saw her

04:36.742 --> 04:39.211
enter the building,
after which he left.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.513
Has there been any more
information obtained

04:41.514 --> 04:43.949
with respect to the victim
entering her apartment building

04:43.950 --> 04:45.917
- that night?
- Yes.

04:45.918 --> 04:48.353
The building is a university residence

04:48.354 --> 04:50.322
that uses an electronic
locking system.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.257
Every entry is electronically recorded

04:52.258 --> 04:54.493
to the tenants' specific cards.

04:54.494 --> 04:57.095
Beth Tremblay's card
was found in her purse

04:57.096 --> 04:59.131
when her body was discovered.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.032
The card showed that the last time

05:01.033 --> 05:02.934
she entered her residence
was not midnight,

05:02.935 --> 05:06.071
as stated by the accused,
but rather 7:30PM.

05:06.072 --> 05:09.541
Thank you, Detective. No
further questions, Your Honour.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.482
Officer.

05:17.483 --> 05:20.719
How long have you been
in the Homicide Division?

05:20.720 --> 05:23.221
A year, but I've
been on the police force

05:23.222 --> 05:25.157
- for almost a decade.
- And is it true

05:25.158 --> 05:28.326
that your employment
with the Homicide Division

05:28.327 --> 05:30.262
is currently probationary, pending

05:30.263 --> 05:33.231
- a successful performance review?
- Yes.

05:33.232 --> 05:35.133
So to be clear,

05:35.134 --> 05:37.169
you've only been a homicide
detective for one year,

05:37.170 --> 05:40.305
- and you are still on probation.
- Correct.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.274
Officer, is it common

05:42.275 --> 05:44.743
in your experience -

05:44.744 --> 05:47.078
for rapists and murderers
to use their own credit card

05:47.079 --> 05:49.080
to buy their victim drinks,

05:49.081 --> 05:51.283
and then openly admit
to having sex with them?

05:51.284 --> 05:53.318
Well, the murder may not
have been premeditated,

05:53.319 --> 05:56.454
but the sexual assault was.
Any death resulting from sexual

05:56.455 --> 05:59.191
- assault is first degree murder.
- I'm sorry Officer,

05:59.192 --> 06:01.159
you didn't answer my question.
Is it common?

06:01.160 --> 06:03.628
No.

06:03.629 --> 06:05.797
No. Do you have any evidence,

06:05.798 --> 06:08.733
in the toxicology report or otherwise,

06:08.734 --> 06:12.003
that proves as a scientific
finding, who spiked.

06:12.004 --> 06:14.439
- Ms. Tremblay's beverage?
- Mr. Graydon

06:14.440 --> 06:17.776
was the last one with her,
and he bought her drink.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.844
As a scientific finding, Officer.

06:19.845 --> 06:22.314
No.

06:22.315 --> 06:25.317
Do you have any CCTV or eyewitnesses

06:25.318 --> 06:28.086
to prove who dropped
Ms. Tremblay's body

06:28.087 --> 06:31.122
by the recycling bins
at the back of her dormitory?

06:31.123 --> 06:33.858
No witnesses have
come forward at present.

06:33.859 --> 06:36.027
So, no?

06:36.028 --> 06:38.163
- Please state your answer.
- No.

06:38.164 --> 06:40.165
Officer, did you say, "I hope the NHL"

06:40.166 --> 06:42.200
accepts 40-year-olds"

06:42.201 --> 06:44.803
to Mr. Graydon the night
he was taken into custody?

06:44.804 --> 06:46.805
What?

06:46.806 --> 06:49.040
No, I...

06:49.041 --> 06:52.043
Because Mr. Graydon
insists that you did before...

06:52.044 --> 06:54.813
- I didn't say that.
- Before he was even

06:54.814 --> 06:57.048
interviewed, which would indicate

06:57.049 --> 06:58.817
that you'd already made your
mind up that he was guilty.

06:58.818 --> 07:02.153
And you've not looked into
any other suspect since.

07:02.154 --> 07:05.056
This really typifies your attitude

07:05.057 --> 07:07.859
to the entire instigation,
doesn't it? Which, from

07:07.860 --> 07:11.329
the beginning, was biased
and filled with oversights

07:11.330 --> 07:13.465
but all that could be attributed
to your lack of experience,

07:13.466 --> 07:16.634
could it not? Officer?

07:24.710 --> 07:27.579
What happened?

07:27.580 --> 07:29.814
Um... I messed up.

07:29.815 --> 07:32.083
Everyone gets nervous.

07:32.084 --> 07:34.452
And to be fair,
you're the first cop I know

07:34.453 --> 07:36.554
to be cross-examined
by her baby daddy.

07:36.555 --> 07:39.057
Ha. Yeah, well. Good luck in there.

07:39.058 --> 07:41.793
I'm gonna nail him. I'll come
and find you when I'm done, OK?

07:41.794 --> 07:45.530
Mhm.

07:45.531 --> 07:48.867
Detective Hall, you were one
of the first officers

07:48.868 --> 07:51.269
at the scene of the crime
the morning Beth Tremblay's body

07:51.270 --> 07:53.438
- was found, correct?
- Yes.

07:53.439 --> 07:56.675
Exhibit 13, Your Honour.
These are the photos taken

07:56.676 --> 07:58.910
of the deceased as she was found.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.912
Detective, can you speak

08:00.913 --> 08:03.581
to the state of the clothes the
victim was wearing at the time?

08:03.582 --> 08:06.217
What struck me
upon examining the victim

08:06.218 --> 08:08.586
was that she appeared
to have been redressed.

08:08.587 --> 08:12.190
Her bra was fastened on a clasp
that she didn't use.

08:12.191 --> 08:15.260
We could tell that because it
was very ill-fitting,

08:15.261 --> 08:17.529
and also by a minor change
in colouration

08:17.530 --> 08:19.898
on the third clasp.

08:19.899 --> 08:22.267
Clearly, it had never
been exposed to her skin.

08:22.268 --> 08:25.570
Also, her tights were on backwards.

08:25.571 --> 08:28.206
The indention of the heel
was at the front of the foot,

08:28.207 --> 08:31.743
leading us to believe that
someone else had put them on her

08:31.744 --> 08:35.480
- after she'd been killed.
- Thank you, Detective.

08:39.751 --> 08:42.886
Officer, is it possible
that an inebriated woman

08:42.888 --> 08:45.590
could have put on her tights backwards

08:45.591 --> 08:47.959
- while trying to get dressed?
- Beth Tremblay

08:47.960 --> 08:51.463
was heavily drugged. She
probably wouldn't have been able

08:51.464 --> 08:53.932
- to put on her tights at all.
- Thank you.

08:53.933 --> 08:56.901
Do you have any evidence
that supports your claim

08:56.902 --> 08:58.937
that Mr. Graydon
is responsible for this?

08:58.938 --> 09:01.606
We know that he'd bought
Beth Tremblay a drink,

09:01.607 --> 09:04.809
they had sex at his residence
and then he brought her home

09:04.810 --> 09:06.811
at midnight. But she could

09:06.812 --> 09:08.813
have easily gone out again.

09:08.814 --> 09:12.450
After all, it was
a Friday night. Correct?

09:12.451 --> 09:15.253
- Highly unlikely.
- You seem very confident.

09:15.254 --> 09:17.989
Do you believe this was
a thorough investigation?

09:17.990 --> 09:21.092
- Absolutely.
- And that you were in

09:21.093 --> 09:23.048
a sound state of mind
while conducting it?

09:23.049 --> 09:23.995
Of course.

09:23.996 --> 09:26.030
Then perhaps you could
help me with a small

09:26.031 --> 09:28.333
housekeeping matter. I seem
to be missing notes from you

09:28.334 --> 09:32.270
- from April 19th to April 23rd.
- Your Honour, the defence

09:32.271 --> 09:34.439
was presented a full set of notes.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.441
Detective Hall, are we missing notes?

09:36.442 --> 09:39.677
Your Honour, I was away
from the case during this time.

09:39.678 --> 09:42.280
Would you clarify that, Ms. Hall?

09:42.281 --> 09:45.183
- I was on a leave of absence.
- I believe it was stress leave.

09:45.184 --> 09:47.318
Correct? To deal with the events
surrounding your son's

09:47.319 --> 09:49.387
recent Autism diagnosis.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.523
Your Honour, objection. Irrelevant.

09:51.524 --> 09:55.727
- I'll allow it.
- Officer?

09:55.728 --> 09:58.863
Officer, can you help the court
understand how you were

09:58.864 --> 10:02.167
of sound mind, conducting
a thorough investigation

10:02.168 --> 10:04.803
when you were, in fact,
on stress leave?

10:04.804 --> 10:07.405
It was a formality.

10:07.406 --> 10:10.375
I'd used up all of my official
leave, but I was still

10:10.376 --> 10:12.310
entitled to stress leave.

10:12.311 --> 10:14.112
But I can assure you,

10:14.113 --> 10:16.414
I was completely of sound mind

10:16.415 --> 10:19.217
- when I was conducting that case.
- And therefore, you thought it

10:19.218 --> 10:22.887
was entirely acceptable to leave
this extremely complicated case

10:22.888 --> 10:25.757
in the hands of an officer
on probation?

10:30.896 --> 10:33.031
No further questions, Your Honour.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.702
Marc just called me out

10:37.703 --> 10:40.171
for taking leave during the case.

10:40.172 --> 10:43.241
- Your notes were missing, so...
- No, no. No, Jac.

10:43.242 --> 10:46.578
That does not explain how he
knew about my stress leave.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.480
Only you and Fiona knew about that.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.915
It was a mistake. OK?
It was back when Marc and I

10:50.916 --> 10:52.984
were dating. You had
taken those days off work.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.019
So I worked 48 hours straight
and he asked why.

10:55.020 --> 10:56.921
But listen, he just
did the same thing to me.

10:56.922 --> 10:59.524
I had already told him what I
said to Graydon and then he

10:59.525 --> 11:01.426
- called me out for being biased.
- What?! You told him details

11:01.427 --> 11:03.828
about the actual case?

11:06.365 --> 11:08.266
And what did you say to that,

11:08.267 --> 11:10.235
on the stand?

11:10.236 --> 11:13.037
I denied it.

11:13.038 --> 11:15.039
Right.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.075
So, we could've had
Marc removed from the case

11:17.076 --> 11:19.077
for using that information
but there goes that idea,

11:19.078 --> 11:21.045
now that you just perjured yourself.

11:21.046 --> 11:23.014
Stevie, I had no idea
he was going to end up

11:23.015 --> 11:25.250
on the defence counsel! I mean,
what're the odds of that?!

11:25.251 --> 11:27.619
- Not that bad, apparently!
- I wasn't thinking.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.554
NO! You weren't.

11:29.555 --> 11:32.090
You never do!

11:32.091 --> 11:35.026
And yet I still
keep on fighting for you.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.962
Every time Fiona says
that she wants to cut you loose,

11:37.963 --> 11:40.031
I say "No, no, no. She's gonna"

11:40.032 --> 11:41.966
be a great detective.
These are just growing pains."

11:41.967 --> 11:45.570
Except this time,
I have to go and tell her

11:45.571 --> 11:47.438
that a serial rapist

11:47.439 --> 11:49.340
and murderer might just walk today

11:49.341 --> 11:51.676
because you weren't thinking!

12:05.575 --> 12:08.010
- This late in the day.
- What's going on?

12:08.011 --> 12:10.679
Emma's testimony's been put
over 'til tomorrow.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.848
Our private investigator
found this this morning.

12:12.849 --> 12:14.683
Looks like the defence

12:14.684 --> 12:16.519
already has it and it's admissible.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.888
That's Emma partying with the accused.

12:18.889 --> 12:22.091
Where did this come from?

12:22.092 --> 12:25.327
It was in the archives of the
Tau Alpha Theta Facebook page.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.563
Do you realize how serious this is?

12:27.564 --> 12:29.598
You said in your hearing

12:29.599 --> 12:31.700
that you didn't know him prior
to the evening of your assault.

12:31.701 --> 12:33.877
- I didn't.
- So when did this happen?

12:33.904 --> 12:36.071
I don't know!

12:38.153 --> 12:40.254
It was probably during Frosh.

12:40.255 --> 12:43.691
Zach would've been like
just another frat guy.

12:43.692 --> 12:46.460
Emma, he's right behind you here.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.729
Are you absolutely sure?

12:48.730 --> 12:50.731
Because it looks to me
like you were on drugs.

12:50.732 --> 12:53.534
I took a bit of Molly that
night but I've never done...

12:53.535 --> 12:55.569
I'd never done it before.
I haven't since.

12:55.570 --> 12:57.571
Did you have any physical interaction

12:57.572 --> 12:59.407
- with Graydon that night at all?
- No!

12:59.408 --> 13:02.376
I didn't. I remember that party.
I remember all of it.

13:02.377 --> 13:05.413
It's not like I blacked out like...

13:05.414 --> 13:08.849
like the next time.

13:08.850 --> 13:10.684
OK. I'm sorry.

13:10.685 --> 13:13.554
Go home. I'll be in touch later.

13:17.759 --> 13:20.594
So... what does this
mean for the trial?

13:20.595 --> 13:22.863
I won't lie. It's not good.

13:22.864 --> 13:25.299
This photo makes Emma's
testimony questionable.

13:25.300 --> 13:29.136
- Anything we can do?
- I know of a similar case

13:29.137 --> 13:31.672
where a frat would put up
pictures in their basement

13:31.673 --> 13:34.041
of girls who would be potential
targets for assault.

13:34.042 --> 13:37.611
I might be able to make
the argument that this photo

13:37.612 --> 13:40.614
means that she was a target,
but the problem

13:40.615 --> 13:42.616
is there are no photos
of Beth Tremblay

13:42.617 --> 13:44.452
up on the site, so it doesn't add up.

13:44.453 --> 13:46.720
Well, we could do a sweep
of the frat website,

13:46.721 --> 13:49.457
access deleted files, see if we
can find Beth there.

13:49.458 --> 13:52.326
I'll see what the defence does
with the photo tomorrow, and...

13:52.327 --> 13:54.795
if necessary, I'll make the argument

13:54.796 --> 13:57.598
for premeditation later.
It's the best I can do for now.

13:59.601 --> 14:02.436
I...

14:02.437 --> 14:04.438
I said I'd be home for seven, so...

14:04.439 --> 14:06.974
Yeah, sure. I'll catch up
with you tomorrow.

14:06.975 --> 14:09.110
OK.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.914
Sounds like a gong show.

14:13.915 --> 14:17.118
You have no idea. Honestly, I
don't know why I even bother.

14:17.119 --> 14:19.120
I should just let Fiona have her way

14:19.121 --> 14:21.122
- and be done with it.
- Well, maybe you should.

14:21.123 --> 14:23.324
No, I know that I should!
But then I'd be stuck

14:23.325 --> 14:25.426
with some... meat-head gym rat

14:25.427 --> 14:27.428
who chugs protein shakes for lunch.

14:29.297 --> 14:31.298
I just can't believe that she

14:31.299 --> 14:33.000
told him all that stuff.

14:33.001 --> 14:35.035
Well... not to play
devil's advocate, but...

14:35.036 --> 14:37.037
Whoa, whoa. I am still whining.

14:38.907 --> 14:40.941
I mean, this was before she
knew what a dick he was, right?

14:40.942 --> 14:43.677
- Yeah.
- Well, I mean, I get it.

14:43.678 --> 14:46.480
Bad move, but... Come on.

14:46.481 --> 14:49.183
I mean, wanting to share stuff
with your partner?

14:49.184 --> 14:51.152
I feel like I'd make the same mistake.

14:51.153 --> 14:54.522
Besides, you told me some things.

14:54.523 --> 14:56.524
- Yeah.
- No, that is not the same.

14:56.525 --> 15:00.361
Babe, I probably know the access code
to the evidence room at this point.

15:00.362 --> 15:02.396
All right, all right, all right.

15:02.397 --> 15:04.532
Fine.

15:04.533 --> 15:07.868
I feel bad now. Am I the worst?

15:07.869 --> 15:10.037
Yeah. Definitely. 100 percent.

15:12.240 --> 15:15.843
It's the prosecution.

15:15.844 --> 15:18.212
Detective Hall.

15:18.213 --> 15:21.315
What? Why?

15:23.218 --> 15:26.987
No. No, it's... it's fine.
I'll let her know.

15:26.988 --> 15:28.889
I'll come and grab them from you now.

15:28.890 --> 15:32.059
Thanks. Bye.

15:32.060 --> 15:35.229
Let me guess. You gotta run.

15:35.230 --> 15:38.365
Just when I thought that
my day could not get any worse,

15:38.366 --> 15:40.501
our main witness is bailing.

15:40.502 --> 15:42.670
I gotta go to the lawyer's

15:42.671 --> 15:44.672
and then to Jac's and then I've
gotta head to the Division.

15:44.673 --> 15:46.907
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

15:46.908 --> 15:48.909
You sure?

15:51.580 --> 15:53.714
Garlic.

15:53.715 --> 15:55.549
Yeah. You should try it sometime,

15:55.550 --> 15:57.651
keep the bloodsuckers away.

16:15.036 --> 16:17.905
What are you doing here?

16:17.906 --> 16:21.108
I was nearby. I figured
I should drop in, say hi,

16:21.109 --> 16:23.077
and make sure we're
still good after today.

16:23.078 --> 16:24.979
- Can I come in, please?
- No!

16:24.980 --> 16:27.205
Just for five minutes. I
just want to talk to you.

16:27.206 --> 16:28.076
No.

16:28.077 --> 16:29.540
- Two minutes.
- No.

16:29.541 --> 16:30.908
One minute, Jac. One minute?

16:33.288 --> 16:36.190
I know how I am in court.

16:36.191 --> 16:40.394
I just wanted to say to you
it is truly not personal.

16:40.395 --> 16:42.296
Are you kidding me?

16:42.297 --> 16:45.332
It's a job! We both know that.
We gotta play the game.

16:45.333 --> 16:48.636
No. No. You took things
I said to you in confidence

16:48.637 --> 16:52.139
and ran me through the mud
with them. You used me, Marc.

16:52.140 --> 16:54.241
You're right. I shouldn't
have used those things.

16:54.242 --> 16:56.076
That was wrong. But I never used you.

16:56.077 --> 16:58.045
Never!

17:00.415 --> 17:04.117
- I did give you my condo.
- And?

17:04.118 --> 17:06.252
And maybe we all kind of pick
and choose our ethics a bit.

17:06.253 --> 17:09.256
And maybe we should
just get over it already.

17:09.257 --> 17:11.925
All I have been doing
is getting over it,

17:11.925 --> 17:14.161
but you just keep showing up!

17:14.162 --> 17:16.430
Isn't there a little part of
you that wants me to show up?

17:16.431 --> 17:20.134
Jac... Jac...

17:20.135 --> 17:22.770
I really wanted to see you.
I've missed you.

17:26.040 --> 17:28.108
You're so crazy beautiful.

17:28.108 --> 17:30.344
Don't.

17:30.345 --> 17:33.013
Nobody can pull off sweats
the way you do.

17:33.014 --> 17:35.015
- You're still totally rockin' it.
- Shut up.

17:35.016 --> 17:37.451
Come here. Come here.

17:37.452 --> 17:40.721
You made it almost impossible

17:40.722 --> 17:43.190
for me to focus.

17:43.191 --> 17:45.659
It was so hard for me
to focus up there today.

17:45.660 --> 17:50.464
- It looked pretty easy to me.
- It's never easy with you, Jac.

17:53.835 --> 17:55.936
I'm pregnant.

17:57.839 --> 17:59.973
What?

18:05.547 --> 18:07.581
Since when?

18:07.582 --> 18:10.050
I don't know.

18:10.051 --> 18:13.387
Since a couple nights
before the last supper, I guess.

18:13.388 --> 18:15.823
Why didn't you tell me?

18:15.824 --> 18:18.392
You made it pretty damn clear

18:18.393 --> 18:20.527
you wanted nothing to do with me.

18:20.528 --> 18:23.664
I was trying to get over it.

18:23.665 --> 18:25.833
Jac...

18:25.834 --> 18:29.436
you should've told me.

18:32.774 --> 18:34.808
So...

18:34.809 --> 18:37.044
are you...

18:37.045 --> 18:39.179
you gonna...

18:39.180 --> 18:41.181
Keep it?

18:41.182 --> 18:43.650
Yeah.

18:50.091 --> 18:52.192
Ahem.

18:55.130 --> 18:57.097
OK.

18:57.098 --> 18:59.099
Jac...

18:59.100 --> 19:01.702
there's no way I can have another kid.

19:01.703 --> 19:04.438
I can't do it.

19:04.439 --> 19:08.308
I mean... are you sure it's even mine?

19:10.245 --> 19:13.414
I was monogamous the whole
time that we were together!

19:13.415 --> 19:16.517
And just so you know, I am
not asking you for anything.

19:16.518 --> 19:18.886
- I want nothing from you.
- OK. OK. Look...

19:18.887 --> 19:20.788
- Nothing!
- Just calm down, please.

19:20.789 --> 19:24.458
I am begging you not to do this. OK?

19:24.459 --> 19:26.527
Do you even really want a kid?

19:26.528 --> 19:29.029
I mean...

19:30.932 --> 19:33.066
You? A mother?

19:35.103 --> 19:37.604
You need to get out. Now. Get out.

19:37.605 --> 19:40.607
- Jac, look...
- Get out.

19:40.608 --> 19:42.609
- Go, go, go!
- Can we just talk about this?

19:42.610 --> 19:44.715
We have to talk about it!

19:44.716 --> 19:46.246
Go home to your family!

19:46.247 --> 19:48.382
Jac...

19:53.655 --> 19:56.056
Back at work are we, Officer?

20:02.263 --> 20:04.364
I told you I...

20:06.334 --> 20:08.669
Stevie. What's going on?

20:08.670 --> 20:11.338
Emma wants out.

20:11.339 --> 20:13.207
She says that she will recant

20:13.208 --> 20:15.509
if we force her to testify.

20:15.510 --> 20:18.512
I came by to ask you to talk
to her. She trusts you and...

20:18.513 --> 20:21.281
you've been on the case the
longest. But you know what,

20:21.282 --> 20:23.183
this shipwreck can't be saved.

20:23.184 --> 20:24.852
Stevie, I... I didn't...

20:24.853 --> 20:27.087
I didn't tell him to come.
He just showed up.

20:27.088 --> 20:29.289
I...

20:29.290 --> 20:32.125
I told him about the baby.

20:33.862 --> 20:36.763
I know I screwed up big.

20:36.764 --> 20:38.799
I screwed up big. And I...

20:38.800 --> 20:41.335
I was reckless.

20:41.336 --> 20:45.506
I'm sorry I let you down.
Can we just figure this out

20:45.507 --> 20:49.398
- inside for a second?
- Yeah. Yeah, come on.

20:50.174 --> 20:52.173
Walk me through this,
what happens if Emma

20:52.174 --> 20:55.112
- recants her evidence?
- We take a massive hit.

20:55.113 --> 20:57.748
The prosecution will drop her
and the next witness

20:57.749 --> 21:00.317
- will be called up.
- Which is a character witness

21:00.318 --> 21:02.319
- for the defence, right?
- That's right, Miranda Towers.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.321
She's engaged to Graydon's
best friend, the goalie.

21:04.322 --> 21:06.523
- I think his name is... Taylor?
- Mhm.

21:06.524 --> 21:09.393
So Kyle interviewed her
when he was at Sex Crimes.

21:09.394 --> 21:11.628
She was at the same party
as Emma. You saw that, right?

21:11.629 --> 21:13.731
- It's on the file.
- Hour 47 of the case

21:13.732 --> 21:16.333
with no sleep. Besides,
doesn't the defence have

21:16.334 --> 21:18.635
- like 15 character witnesses?
- Yeah, yeah.

21:18.636 --> 21:21.372
- Something like that.
- All right.

21:21.373 --> 21:24.575
Let's find her on social media

21:24.576 --> 21:26.777
and see what we are up against.

21:26.778 --> 21:28.545
Here we go, Miranda Towers.

21:28.546 --> 21:30.381
It looks like she's auditioning

21:30.382 --> 21:32.829
- for The Real Hockey Wives of Whatever.
- Yeah?

21:32.830 --> 21:36.086
She's a fitness star,
over 40000 followers.

21:36.087 --> 21:37.955
When was the party?

21:37.956 --> 21:39.757
- October 12th?
- Yeah.

21:39.758 --> 21:43.394
Well, she was competing in the
Wildcat Challenge the morning

21:43.395 --> 21:45.963
of October 13th. I highly
doubt she was raging

21:45.964 --> 21:48.298
until 3AM the night before.
How did I miss this?

21:48.299 --> 21:50.300
Well, I was on stress leave

21:50.301 --> 21:52.302
and you were circling
complete burnout.

21:52.303 --> 21:54.338
I will take a closer look

21:54.339 --> 21:56.607
at the Miranda interview but you
know what? We have got to deal

21:56.608 --> 21:58.609
with Emma now. She is on her way

21:58.610 --> 22:01.778
to the Division to recant, so...

22:03.982 --> 22:06.683
This is Emma's original
prelim testimony.

22:06.684 --> 22:09.987
She has got to stick to this.
Otherwise, we are done.

22:09.988 --> 22:13.323
Understand, Detective Cooper?

22:13.324 --> 22:15.325
Do you have this?

22:15.326 --> 22:17.694
I got this.

22:19.597 --> 22:23.167
Hey. Sorry. I know it's late,
but we don't have decaf here.

22:23.168 --> 22:25.002
- That's OK.
- You sure

22:25.003 --> 22:26.937
you don't want me to make you
some tea or something?

22:26.938 --> 22:29.907
No. I don't really sleep anyway.

22:33.344 --> 22:35.446
- Hey. You good?
- Yeah. Thanks, Finch.

22:35.447 --> 22:38.348
Hey.

22:38.349 --> 22:40.350
Hey.

22:40.351 --> 22:42.553
Long day?

22:42.554 --> 22:44.354
So...

22:44.355 --> 22:46.490
I hear you want to recant.

22:46.491 --> 22:49.026
Yeah.

22:49.027 --> 22:51.528
You know if you do this,
there's no going back.

22:51.529 --> 22:54.064
You get dropped as a witness

22:54.065 --> 22:56.500
and that is great news for Zach.

22:56.501 --> 22:59.002
- They're gonna rip me apart.
- Well, cross-examinations

22:59.003 --> 23:00.871
can be tough, but we'll
make sure you're prepared.

23:00.872 --> 23:03.540
What if... he's right?

23:03.541 --> 23:06.877
I was so happy that night

23:06.878 --> 23:09.413
that he was even talking to me.

23:09.414 --> 23:12.749
What if I... said
that I'd sleep with him

23:12.750 --> 23:15.652
or... I don't know, maybe I did
imagine the whole thing.

23:15.653 --> 23:17.654
No. You listen to me, OK?

23:17.655 --> 23:20.157
You cannot consent

23:20.158 --> 23:22.860
if you are drugged.

23:22.861 --> 23:24.795
Besides, do you really think

23:24.796 --> 23:27.498
that you imagined the bruises
around your neck?

23:27.499 --> 23:29.666
Look, I...

23:29.667 --> 23:33.270
I get what you're saying, I do, but...

23:36.741 --> 23:39.076
Most days, I can't

23:39.077 --> 23:41.945
even think straight.

23:41.946 --> 23:45.082
I can't sleep. I can't eat. I can't...

23:45.083 --> 23:48.085
I can't study. I can't focus.

23:48.086 --> 23:51.922
I just... I... I can't do this.
I'm sorry. I can't.

23:51.923 --> 23:54.424
You can do this, Emma.

23:54.425 --> 23:57.528
Yeah, says the cop who blew it
on the stand today.

23:57.529 --> 23:59.429
I heard that you

23:59.430 --> 24:01.565
were a total disaster.

24:01.566 --> 24:04.201
What are we doing here?
This is a joke!

24:04.202 --> 24:06.203
So let's just forget it already.

24:06.204 --> 24:08.138
No. Look, you came to me

24:08.139 --> 24:11.275
because a girl you knew
had her life stolen,

24:11.276 --> 24:13.276
and you couldn't stomach that.

24:19.617 --> 24:22.252
I know it feels like

24:22.253 --> 24:23.887
you have nothing, Emma,

24:23.888 --> 24:25.756
but you still

24:25.757 --> 24:28.292
have your voice.

24:28.293 --> 24:30.827
Beth doesn't.

24:32.564 --> 24:35.699
That's why you came forward
in the first place, isn't it?

24:39.470 --> 24:41.705
Yeah.

24:46.578 --> 24:48.579
What's this?

24:48.580 --> 24:51.915
A transcript
from your preliminary hearing.

24:51.916 --> 24:54.918
You're gonna memorize it. You're
gonna stick to it. And tomorrow,

24:54.919 --> 24:58.188
you are gonna go in there
with your chin up.

25:00.858 --> 25:02.826
- OK.
- OK.

25:02.827 --> 25:04.761
Good.

25:06.631 --> 25:08.732
Follow me.

25:16.307 --> 25:18.542
OK.

25:20.445 --> 25:23.013
This interview is being taped
and recorded and may be given

25:23.014 --> 25:25.148
in evidence if this case
is brought to trial.

25:25.149 --> 25:28.518
We're in an interview room at the 14th
Division. My name is Detective Sergeant

25:28.519 --> 25:31.655
Kyle Price. Please state
your full name.

25:31.656 --> 25:33.624
Miranda Towers.

25:33.625 --> 25:36.493
Miranda.

25:36.494 --> 25:39.596
You said you were
at the Tau Alpha Theta party.

25:39.597 --> 25:41.398
Did you see Emma Wright
while you were there?

25:41.399 --> 25:43.367
Yeah, she was chatting with Zach.

25:43.368 --> 25:45.836
What time was this?

25:45.837 --> 25:48.105
I think it was around 9:30.

25:49.841 --> 25:52.676
And do you remember
exactly what you drank?

25:52.677 --> 25:55.512
Yeah. The punch
that was going around.

25:55.513 --> 25:57.881
Zach brought me a cup.

25:57.882 --> 26:00.317
I had a cup or two. It wasn't so bad.

26:00.318 --> 26:02.719
Not bad. What kind of punch was it?

26:02.720 --> 26:04.521
Um...

26:04.522 --> 26:06.390
I'm not sure, actually.

26:06.391 --> 26:08.692
It was grape, I guess.

26:08.693 --> 26:11.061
It was purple and super sweet.

26:11.062 --> 26:14.498
Actually... kind of gross.

26:14.499 --> 26:17.367
And what happened
right after you drank it?

26:17.368 --> 26:20.237
It's hazy. I was on the dance floor.

26:20.238 --> 26:23.140
- I saw them on the dance floor.
- Yeah.

26:23.141 --> 26:25.542
What kind of music was it?

26:29.113 --> 26:32.249
- Miranda?
- Music was music.

26:32.250 --> 26:34.651
They were playing a lot of hip-hop.

26:34.652 --> 26:37.587
Um... that new Weeknd track
was playing.

26:37.588 --> 26:40.624
How long did you two dance for?

26:40.625 --> 26:43.193
Not long.

26:43.194 --> 26:46.363
Um... I started to get dizzy

26:46.364 --> 26:49.032
and...

26:49.033 --> 26:51.501
Zach led me upstairs.

26:51.502 --> 26:54.071
And then I passed out.

26:54.072 --> 26:56.006
They were dancing all night.

26:56.007 --> 26:58.108
It looked like they
were having a good time.

26:58.109 --> 27:00.277
When you say all night,
can you be more specific?

27:00.278 --> 27:02.713
I don't know.

27:02.714 --> 27:04.614
Hours.

27:04.615 --> 27:07.551
Zach's actually a really great dancer.

27:07.552 --> 27:09.886
I woke up in some bed.

27:09.887 --> 27:12.923
Zach was on top of me.

27:12.924 --> 27:17.060
I could see his face. I could
smell the punch on his breath.

27:19.964 --> 27:22.132
I...

27:22.133 --> 27:24.634
I couldn't move because...

27:24.635 --> 27:27.003
he, um...

27:27.004 --> 27:29.372
he had his hands around my neck.

27:33.311 --> 27:35.812
And after that, everything went black.

27:37.815 --> 27:40.016
What time do you think they left?

27:40.017 --> 27:42.452
Around 2AM.

27:42.453 --> 27:44.788
Emma seemed fine.

27:44.789 --> 27:47.157
She was laughing a lot.

27:49.560 --> 27:52.162
After that, Taylor and I went home.

27:52.163 --> 27:54.431
We'll be in touch if we
have any further questions.

27:56.334 --> 27:58.769
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:58.770 --> 28:01.738
- She is going to testify.
- Thank God.

28:01.739 --> 28:04.808
- How 'bout you?
- Yeah, I've been taking a look

28:04.809 --> 28:07.577
at hockey wife. She doesn't remember

28:07.578 --> 28:10.180
what punch she was drinking.
She doesn't remember

28:10.181 --> 28:12.115
what music was playing.
I don't buy it.

28:12.116 --> 28:15.051
She's wearing

28:15.052 --> 28:17.854
a fitness tracker. Most gym rats
don't take those off.

28:17.855 --> 28:19.589
If we can get her hands on it,
it might have logged

28:19.590 --> 28:20.462
her activity that night.

28:20.463 --> 28:21.992
If she was wearing it.
That's a big if.

28:21.993 --> 28:23.994
Well, those things
have a GPS too, so if she was

28:23.995 --> 28:25.962
wearing it, we'll at least
know where she was.

28:25.963 --> 28:29.166
OK. Well, I will get Kyle
to get a subpoena,

28:29.167 --> 28:31.368
get it off her first thing
in the morning. If it proves

28:31.369 --> 28:34.271
that she wasn't at the party,
we could get her for fabrication

28:34.272 --> 28:36.540
of evidence. Throw a hole
in the defence.

28:36.541 --> 28:38.642
Great. Sounds like a plan.

28:38.643 --> 28:42.212
And Stevie, one more thing.
Can you say Kyle one more time

28:42.213 --> 28:44.481
because every time you do,
your face looks like...

28:44.482 --> 28:46.983
- Kyle!
- Wha...

28:48.753 --> 28:51.054
Kyle.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.831
I woke up on the grass

29:00.832 --> 29:03.301
by the parking lot near the frat house

29:03.302 --> 29:05.569
with my clothes on.

29:05.570 --> 29:08.506
But, um, they were on all weird.

29:08.507 --> 29:11.809
My belt was twisted and
my jeans were unbuttoned.

29:11.810 --> 29:14.278
My bra was on inside out

29:14.279 --> 29:17.014
and... my underwear

29:17.015 --> 29:19.016
was missing entirely.

29:19.017 --> 29:21.786
I had no idea how I got there,

29:21.787 --> 29:24.555
so I... I just got up and walked home.

29:24.556 --> 29:26.824
The next day,

29:26.825 --> 29:29.193
I saw all of the bruising on my neck

29:29.194 --> 29:31.195
and on my thighs

29:31.196 --> 29:33.197
and I went to the clinic

29:33.198 --> 29:35.299
to have a rape kit done,

29:35.300 --> 29:37.535
but they said that it would

29:37.536 --> 29:40.805
take a while to get
the DNA results back

29:40.806 --> 29:43.140
and I missed a couple of calls
back from them

29:43.141 --> 29:45.676
and I guess I wasn't

29:45.677 --> 29:48.479
thinking straight, because
finally I just told them

29:48.480 --> 29:51.015
that I wasn't gonna
file a police report.

29:51.016 --> 29:53.651
And then five months later,

29:53.652 --> 29:56.187
I heard that Beth
had died, and I heard

29:56.188 --> 29:58.322
that Zach was the suspect.

29:58.323 --> 30:00.291
And that's when I changed my mind

30:00.292 --> 30:02.593
and I decided to come
forward to the police,

30:02.594 --> 30:05.262
but, um...

30:05.263 --> 30:07.031
but it was too late,

30:07.032 --> 30:09.967
because they had destroyed
my kit at the clinic.

30:09.968 --> 30:12.570
But I know that it was him.

30:14.573 --> 30:16.607
Thank you.

30:19.044 --> 30:21.879
Thank you, Ms. Wright.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.914
The court will now take a short
break, and then the floor

30:23.915 --> 30:26.951
is yours, Counsel.

30:29.187 --> 30:31.655
OK. What's up?

30:31.656 --> 30:33.657
We got the subpoena.

30:33.658 --> 30:35.593
I got the fit tracker
off Miranda this morning.

30:35.594 --> 30:36.746
And?

30:36.747 --> 30:38.829
It turns out she was wearing
it the night of the party,

30:38.830 --> 30:42.066
But she wasn't dancing all night.
She was sleeping in her dorm room.

30:42.067 --> 30:44.668
These things track
sleep cycles too. Hers read.

30:44.669 --> 30:46.337
"Deep rest cycle." It had her
heart rhythms and all.

30:46.338 --> 30:49.006
6AM the next day, she was at
the Regional Park Race Course.

30:49.007 --> 30:51.609
Doing uphill sprints.
Your girl's covering.

30:53.912 --> 30:56.414
Ms. Wright.

30:56.415 --> 30:59.750
Why did you take so long
to go to the police?

30:59.751 --> 31:02.019
I didn't think it was worth it.

31:02.020 --> 31:03.854
I'm sorry.

31:03.855 --> 31:07.591
What do you mean by "worth it"?

31:07.592 --> 31:10.594
Worth the pain.

31:10.595 --> 31:12.463
Worth reliving it all again

31:12.464 --> 31:14.432
and having no one believe me.

31:14.433 --> 31:17.268
And the clinic destroyed
your sexual assault kit

31:17.269 --> 31:19.937
because you told them you didn't
intend to go to the police. Correct?

31:19.938 --> 31:22.373
I changed my mind

31:22.374 --> 31:25.242
when I heard that Beth
had died, but by then,

31:25.243 --> 31:27.244
the clinic had already
destroyed the kit.

31:27.245 --> 31:29.947
I understand.

31:29.948 --> 31:33.684
Defence Exhibit 4, Your Honour.

31:36.288 --> 31:39.457
This is a photo

31:39.458 --> 31:41.859
taken at a fraternity party.

31:41.860 --> 31:44.128
Can you confirm that this
is you in the photo,

31:44.129 --> 31:46.664
- Ms. Wright?
- Yes.

31:46.665 --> 31:49.333
When was this party?

31:49.334 --> 31:51.302
That was during Frosh,

31:51.303 --> 31:53.270
the first week of fall semester.

31:53.271 --> 31:55.940
So, one year prior
to your alleged incident

31:55.941 --> 31:58.909
- with Mr. Graydon?
- Yes.

31:58.910 --> 32:01.378
What is this in your mouth?

32:03.215 --> 32:05.816
- It's a pacifier.
- Is that something

32:05.817 --> 32:07.918
that partygoers
use to prevent themselves

32:07.919 --> 32:10.654
from grinding their teeth
while they're on drugs?

32:10.655 --> 32:12.490
Yes.

32:12.491 --> 32:14.492
Were you on drugs

32:14.493 --> 32:16.494
the evening this photo was taken?

32:16.495 --> 32:18.462
Yes.

32:18.463 --> 32:20.331
What kind of drugs
were you on, Ms. Wright?

32:20.332 --> 32:22.833
- Molly.
- So...

32:22.834 --> 32:27.271
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine,
also called Ecstacy.

32:27.272 --> 32:29.473
Did you voluntarily take this drug?

32:29.474 --> 32:31.842
That was the first
and only time that...

32:31.843 --> 32:34.812
- Please state your answer, Ms. Wright.
- Yes.

32:34.813 --> 32:36.255
There are several
people dancing in this

32:36.256 --> 32:37.715
photo. Can you confirm
that the individual

32:37.716 --> 32:40.117
directly behind you is,
in fact, Mr. Graydon?

32:40.118 --> 32:42.119
Yes.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.321
In your preliminary testimony,
you stated that you'd

32:44.322 --> 32:46.457
never met Mr. Graydon before,

32:46.458 --> 32:48.559
yet here you are together
one year earlier.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.961
I had no idea who he was at the time.

32:50.962 --> 32:53.864
This was during the first week
of school, so no one knew him.

32:53.865 --> 32:55.933
So it was a coincidence, or...

32:55.934 --> 32:57.935
you did know him, and you had

32:57.936 --> 33:00.671
taken recreational drugs
with him. After all, you do seem

33:00.672 --> 33:02.673
to enjoy yourself
at these campus events.

33:02.674 --> 33:05.476
- Objection, Your Honour. Inflammatory.
- Sustained.

33:05.477 --> 33:07.478
I didn't know him.

33:07.479 --> 33:10.981
Ms. Wright, what exactly were
you studying at university?

33:10.982 --> 33:13.217
English literature
and creative writing.

33:13.218 --> 33:16.453
So you're a great storyteller.
You were on the dean's list.

33:16.454 --> 33:19.023
And you were also
on scholarship, correct?

33:19.024 --> 33:21.559
What does that have
to do with anything?

33:21.560 --> 33:25.062
- Answer the question, please.
- Yes.

33:25.063 --> 33:27.698
Did you recently lose
your scholarship?

33:27.699 --> 33:30.768
I...

33:33.171 --> 33:35.506
I w...

33:35.507 --> 33:37.541
I was depressed after what...

33:37.542 --> 33:40.544
- Please answer the question, yes or no.
- Yes.

33:40.545 --> 33:42.913
It's convenient timing, isn't it?

33:42.914 --> 33:45.015
Because if Mr. Graydon
were to be found guilty,

33:45.016 --> 33:49.086
then you could pursue
civil action, which means

33:49.087 --> 33:51.021
you could get a lot of money
in damages, couldn't you?

33:51.022 --> 33:52.923
You think this is about money?

33:52.924 --> 33:54.858
Well, that would certainly
make it "worth it."

33:54.859 --> 33:58.362
- Objection, Your Honour. Speculation.
- Overruled.

33:58.363 --> 34:00.264
Did your creativity help
you to spin a tragedy

34:00.265 --> 34:03.267
about drugging and sexual
assault in order to obtain

34:03.268 --> 34:06.737
- damages from Mr. Graydon?
- No. No! I would...

34:06.738 --> 34:09.106
I would give a million dollars
just so I could

34:09.107 --> 34:11.108
have my life back after that night.

34:11.109 --> 34:13.110
Then why would you allow the clinic

34:13.110 --> 34:15.112
to destroy your sexual assault kit?

34:15.112 --> 34:18.148
That sounds like fiction.
Did you fabricate this story

34:18.149 --> 34:20.016
to get away with an allegation of rape

34:20.018 --> 34:21.885
without the burden

34:21.886 --> 34:23.887
- of DNA evidence?
- No, I... No! I didn't!

34:23.888 --> 34:27.091
You even managed to convince a rookie
detective currently on probation

34:27.092 --> 34:30.360
that it was true. Didn't you?

34:32.496 --> 34:35.899
It's a very compelling tale,
Ms. Wright.

34:38.803 --> 34:41.304
No further questions, Your Honour.

34:48.980 --> 34:51.649
Ahem. Let's take a 15 minute recess.

35:05.047 --> 35:08.057
- Why won't you return my calls?
- I have nothing to say to you.

35:08.058 --> 35:09.794
- I can't have another kid, Jac.
- Told you.

35:09.795 --> 35:11.796
- I don't want anything from you.
- You've shown up

35:11.797 --> 35:13.932
- at my house before.
- And once was enough.

35:13.933 --> 35:16.801
You're ruining my life.

35:16.802 --> 35:19.571
Get over it already.

35:19.572 --> 35:21.372
- You OK?
- Yeah, fine.

35:21.373 --> 35:24.542
How was the cross-examination?

35:24.543 --> 35:27.372
Right. Well, I just
spoke to Kyle. Turns out

35:27.373 --> 35:30.598
Miranda was wearing the fitness
tracker. And it was on a deep

35:30.599 --> 35:33.435
sleep cycle during the time she
said she was at the party.

35:33.436 --> 35:35.437
- That little...
- Yeah.

35:35.438 --> 35:37.224
I know. We need to deal with her now.

35:37.225 --> 35:39.426
She goes on the stand in an hour.

36:00.882 --> 36:02.883
Some trial?

36:02.884 --> 36:04.885
Pretty crazy.

36:04.886 --> 36:06.853
You spoke to a colleague of ours

36:06.854 --> 36:08.722
a while back, about the party

36:08.723 --> 36:10.657
where Emma Wright
was assaulted. Correct?

36:10.658 --> 36:13.360
- I already gave my statement.
- Are you aware

36:13.361 --> 36:16.062
that lying to an officer
is a criminal offence?

36:16.063 --> 36:19.566
And withholding evidence
about Zach is obstruction?

36:19.567 --> 36:21.401
I don't know, Detective.

36:21.402 --> 36:23.370
Obstruction's pretty sweet.

36:23.371 --> 36:25.672
- Accessory to murder, though...
- Accessory?!

36:25.673 --> 36:28.174
What? I didn't do anything.

36:28.175 --> 36:30.277
We know that you weren't at the party.

36:30.278 --> 36:33.613
You are about to testify
in a first-degree murder trial.

36:33.614 --> 36:36.917
If it comes out that you're lying,

36:36.918 --> 36:39.986
you're gonna be facing
some very serious consequences.

36:39.987 --> 36:42.422
Why are you

36:42.423 --> 36:44.391
- covering for Zach?
- I'm sorry.

36:44.392 --> 36:47.193
- I can't...
- Can't what?

36:47.194 --> 36:50.063
- If I say anything, they'll...
- Who's "they"?

36:50.064 --> 36:52.065
Look, I know. I know I should

36:52.066 --> 36:54.100
have said something earlier.

36:54.101 --> 36:56.436
I know, it's just...
Look, I wasn't even supposed

36:56.437 --> 36:58.538
to see it. They had no idea...

36:58.539 --> 37:01.875
OK, slow down. Slow down.
What did you see?

37:01.876 --> 37:04.611
No, you don't get it. They're really
great guys, I swear. They're just...

37:04.612 --> 37:06.780
They get so wasted

37:06.781 --> 37:08.949
and these girls, they just
throw themselves at them.

37:08.950 --> 37:10.784
Like... I...

37:10.785 --> 37:13.420
Look, I know them.
I know them. They're r...

37:13.421 --> 37:15.922
What happened to Beth,

37:15.923 --> 37:17.924
it must have been
a mistake, an accident.

37:17.925 --> 37:19.759
Look, they would never actually...

37:19.760 --> 37:22.395
You need to tell us
exactly what you know.

37:22.396 --> 37:24.831
Taylor's my fiancé.

37:24.832 --> 37:27.734
We have a future together.
We have plans.

37:27.735 --> 37:31.571
He can't go to jail. Please, he can't.

37:31.572 --> 37:33.974
Miranda, a girl is dead.

37:33.975 --> 37:36.576
What do you know?

37:52.827 --> 37:55.361
Have you guys seen Miranda?

38:04.839 --> 38:06.272
Amelia, you need to see this.

38:18.519 --> 38:21.921
Your Honour, may we meet in chambers?

38:23.858 --> 38:25.859
Your Honour, we've recently
been given new evidence

38:25.860 --> 38:27.660
related to the testimony of Ms. Wright

38:27.661 --> 38:29.829
- that we would like to disclose.
- I beg your pardon...

38:29.830 --> 38:32.332
That was accidentally sent
to Miranda Towers as part

38:32.333 --> 38:35.635
of a group message on the night
of Emma Wright's assault.

38:35.636 --> 38:37.637
Miranda's fiancé, Taylor Hargrove,

38:37.638 --> 38:40.673
was filming it. Emma is unconscious.

38:40.674 --> 38:43.643
Your Honour, I have no idea
where this evidence comes from,

38:43.644 --> 38:46.046
- and this approach to discovery...
- Detectives Hall and Cooper

38:46.047 --> 38:48.148
are filing a property form
as we speak.

38:48.149 --> 38:50.050
Given the late disclosure
to the defence,

38:50.051 --> 38:52.052
this is clearly
grounds for a mistrial.

38:52.053 --> 38:54.154
I understand that, Mr. Savage,

38:54.155 --> 38:57.057
but you're aware
that this is very serious.

38:57.058 --> 38:59.426
The defendant will be facing

38:59.427 --> 39:02.162
multiple charges
of sexual assault regardless.

39:02.163 --> 39:04.831
Now, how would you like to proceed?

39:11.338 --> 39:13.773
I think I'll need to confer
with my client, Your Honour.

39:22.768 --> 39:24.769
So...

39:24.770 --> 39:27.571
Looks like sentencing
will be in about a week.

39:27.572 --> 39:30.164
But there's gonna
be a new murder trial?

39:30.165 --> 39:33.234
Yeah. Not for a while, though.

39:33.235 --> 39:35.770
But we did a sweep of the photos

39:35.771 --> 39:37.738
on the frat site
and we found one of Beth,

39:37.739 --> 39:39.941
so we should be able
to prove that these assaults

39:39.942 --> 39:43.411
were premeditated. When Beth's case

39:43.412 --> 39:47.248
goes to trial... will you
be willing to testify again?

39:47.249 --> 39:49.350
Um...

39:51.086 --> 39:53.087
Yeah.

39:53.088 --> 39:54.922
Yeah.

39:54.923 --> 39:57.525
Can I still watch the video?

39:57.526 --> 40:00.261
Are you sure?

40:00.262 --> 40:03.030
I just... I need to know
that I didn't make this up.

40:04.967 --> 40:06.934
It's all cued up.

40:06.935 --> 40:09.370
I'll be right outside, OK?

40:29.424 --> 40:32.426
Yo, hold up guys! I'm
filming this! Hold on! Hold on!

40:32.427 --> 40:35.730
Zach! Hey, Zach! Heyyy!

40:35.731 --> 40:38.666
She's fine. She's fine.

40:38.667 --> 40:40.468
- Yo, yo. I'm good. I'm good.
- Hold her up.

40:40.469 --> 40:43.404
- I've got her!
- Hold her!

40:43.405 --> 40:46.407
Someone give him a hand.

40:46.408 --> 40:48.409
- She's fine.
- Hey. Help him, help him.

40:48.410 --> 40:51.245
Hey! Get her up. Get her up.
Get her up.

40:51.246 --> 40:52.613
There you go!

40:55.284 --> 40:57.318
There you go.

40:57.319 --> 40:59.487
There she is.

41:26.014 --> 41:28.849
Hey.

41:28.850 --> 41:30.951
You OK?

41:30.952 --> 41:33.354
Need a ride home or anything?

41:33.355 --> 41:35.890
Actually, my parents are outside.

41:42.898 --> 41:44.865
Take it easy, Detective.

41:44.866 --> 41:47.501
Yeah. You too.

41:58.146 --> 42:01.148
Hey, Stevie. You get the
statement from Miranda yet?

42:01.149 --> 42:03.384
Yes. But we can't charge her.

42:03.385 --> 42:06.053
Taylor confirmed that he sent
the video to her by mistake,

42:06.054 --> 42:09.190
so she had no legal obligation
to share it with us.

42:09.191 --> 42:11.525
I'm guessing the wedding's off, then.

42:11.526 --> 42:13.427
Yeah, I guess so. She'll get over it.

42:13.428 --> 42:16.263
Everyone does, right?

42:18.166 --> 42:20.167
Night night, Stevie.

42:20.168 --> 42:22.136
Goodnight, Kyle.

42:22.137 --> 42:24.071
Stevie?!

42:24.072 --> 42:27.241
Jac? I thought you'd gone home.

42:27.242 --> 42:30.211
It's the baby.

42:30.212 --> 42:33.948
I'm... I'm bleeding.
Something's wrong.

42:33.949 --> 42:36.350
OK. Come on.
Let's get you out of here.
