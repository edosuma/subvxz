00:00.880 --> 00:03.960
Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.960 --> 00:05.500
That star laid right on

00:05.500 --> 00:07.040
the southeast corner
of that swamp.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.039
-RICK: The back door.

00:08.039 --> 00:09.100
-This leads to the Money Pit.

00:09.100 --> 00:10.100
Here it comes.

00:10.100 --> 00:11.100
Steady up.

00:11.100 --> 00:13.340
I think the swamp has answers,
and I want them.

00:13.340 --> 00:14.340
-It’s a coin!

00:14.340 --> 00:15.610
Maybe there are answers
in the swamp.

00:15.690 --> 00:16.490
-Oh, oh, whoa, whoa!

00:16.490 --> 00:17.649
It looks like a pile
of boulders.

00:17.749 --> 00:18.749
LAIRD:
See the water?

00:18.749 --> 00:20.300
Substantial amount of water
flowing out of it.

00:20.300 --> 00:21.300
Maybe the flood tunnel?

00:21.300 --> 00:22.560
COLIN (over Skype):
The wood in the slipway

00:22.560 --> 00:25.310
matches with
the 550-year-old tree.

00:25.310 --> 00:26.310
-It is original.

00:26.310 --> 00:26.910
-Predates the Money Pit.

00:26.910 --> 00:27.410
-Yes.

00:27.410 --> 00:28.369
-It’s conclusive proof.

00:29.869 --> 00:32.930
NARRATOR:
There is an island

00:32.930 --> 00:35.160
in the North Atlantic...

00:35.160 --> 00:37.870
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:37.870 --> 00:40.890
for more than 200 years.

00:40.890 --> 00:44.830
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.830 --> 00:47.590
with strange symbols carved
into it,

00:47.590 --> 00:50.740
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.740 --> 00:54.460
and a lead cross whose origin
may stretch back

00:54.460 --> 00:57.220
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:57.220 --> 01:01.329
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.329
And, according to legend,

01:03.329 --> 01:06.329
one more will have to die

01:06.329 --> 01:11.330
before the treasure
can be found.

01:14.930 --> 01:16.530
♪ ♪ Music ♪ ♪

01:17.530 --> 01:21.380
(thunder rumbling)

01:22.480 --> 01:25.059
NARRATOR:
With only two weeks to go

01:25.159 --> 01:26.600
before the Oak Island team

01:26.600 --> 01:30.070
is set to leave the island
for the winter,

01:30.070 --> 01:33.780
the activity at the Money Pit
area remains at a standstill.

01:33.780 --> 01:34.950
The strike is on.

01:34.950 --> 01:37.740
It can last anywhere
from one to 21 days.

01:37.740 --> 01:39.619
That’s the only good news.

01:39.619 --> 01:42.469
I’m still optimistic
it won’t go 21,

01:42.469 --> 01:43.469
but in the meantime,

01:43.469 --> 01:46.649
we are shut down
and we are running out of time.

01:46.649 --> 01:48.149
I’m not seeing anybody.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.039
RICK:
Hammer grab is down.

01:50.039 --> 01:51.760
CRAIG:
That does not look good.

01:51.760 --> 01:52.969
We’re in trouble.

01:52.969 --> 01:54.590
NARRATOR:
One week ago,

01:54.590 --> 01:56.670
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,

01:56.670 --> 01:59.100
along with their partner
Craig Tester,

01:59.100 --> 02:01.310
received troubling news
that the union

02:01.310 --> 02:04.279
of crane operators
for the province of Nova Scotia

02:04.279 --> 02:06.170
had suddenly gone on strike.

02:06.170 --> 02:07.499
-It’s just a waiting game.

02:07.499 --> 02:08.499
-Mm-hmm.

02:08.499 --> 02:10.190
They’re hoping to have this
resolved within 21 days.

02:10.190 --> 02:12.080
NARRATOR:
It is a development

02:12.080 --> 02:14.380
that forced a halt
to the Oak Island team’s

02:14.380 --> 02:16.860
current excavation
in the borehole known

02:16.860 --> 02:20.720
as Site Three,
a borehole that they believe

02:20.720 --> 02:24.030
could be on course to intersect
the original Money Pit.

02:24.030 --> 02:26.190
There’s no question
it’s serious.

02:26.190 --> 02:30.860
If it’s an all-stop, well,
we can’t proceed.

02:30.860 --> 02:33.200
NARRATOR:
While the excavation

02:33.200 --> 02:34.870
in Smith’s Cove continues...

02:34.870 --> 02:36.340
RICK: I think we should
call Marty up.

02:36.340 --> 02:38.650
NARRATOR: ...Rick and Craig
are meeting with Marty

02:38.650 --> 02:41.240
via videoconference
in the war room

02:41.240 --> 02:43.410
to discuss
a radical new strategy

02:43.410 --> 02:46.250
to help them achieve
their ultimate goal,

02:46.250 --> 02:49.970
to solve the 223-year old
Oak Island mystery.

02:49.970 --> 02:50.970
Hey, Marty.

02:50.970 --> 02:51.970
Hey, guys.

02:51.970 --> 02:53.840
How’s it going out there?

02:53.840 --> 02:56.110
Uh, it’s wet and cold today.

02:56.110 --> 02:57.340
Wet and cold.

02:57.340 --> 02:59.370
Glad I’m not there, then.

02:59.370 --> 03:00.370
No offense.

03:00.370 --> 03:02.640
RICK (laughs):
Well, guys, look, I...

03:02.640 --> 03:05.240
I think we need to make
some decisions.

03:05.240 --> 03:08.790
Because of the strike,
the door is closed,

03:08.790 --> 03:11.050
and, uh, so with the possibility

03:11.050 --> 03:14.300
that the strike may indeed last
the full 21 days,

03:14.300 --> 03:15.300
what are we gonna do?

03:15.300 --> 03:16.300
MARTY:
Talk about right down

03:16.300 --> 03:17.300
to the wire, huh?

03:17.300 --> 03:20.760
Are we gonna have time
to finish this year?

03:20.760 --> 03:22.900
You get into November,
it’s gonna get ugly, right?

03:22.900 --> 03:24.970
I was here last year
till November 18.

03:24.970 --> 03:27.870
The prob... the thing is,
is that the strike,

03:27.870 --> 03:30.100
we know that’s
an elongated process, right?

03:30.100 --> 03:32.000
That’s gonna take a long time.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.260
Why would we dither about

03:34.260 --> 03:37.550
and then it-it turns out that
we have to wait till November

03:37.550 --> 03:39.100
’cause we squandered
these weeks?

03:39.100 --> 03:40.100
And we’re just gonna get

03:40.100 --> 03:42.210
too close to it,
won’t be able to dig.

03:42.210 --> 03:44.000
Then we’re shooting ourselves
in the foot.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.260
You know, we got about
two weeks left

03:46.260 --> 03:48.290
before it gets ugly out there.

03:48.290 --> 03:51.220
Let’s finish up Smith’s Cove,
and then we take

03:51.220 --> 03:53.820
a long, deep breath,
and we decide either

03:53.820 --> 03:55.990
we’re looking at enough stuff

03:55.990 --> 03:58.890
that encourages us
to keep going

03:58.890 --> 04:01.260
or we’re not,
but we sure as hell

04:01.260 --> 04:03.470
would have done a damn good try
this season.

04:03.470 --> 04:05.630
-Do you feel that way, Craig?

04:05.630 --> 04:06.630
-CRAIG: Yeah.

04:06.630 --> 04:10.580
But I-I guess the one issue Rick
and I were kicking around is:

04:10.580 --> 04:12.880
How-how thin are we gonna
spread ourselves,

04:12.880 --> 04:16.040
and are we just
stressing ourselves out?

04:16.040 --> 04:20.029
So I’m gonna say finish
Smith’s Cove, and then,

04:20.029 --> 04:22.430
um, I don’t know, but...

04:22.430 --> 04:25.760
maybe it’s time to call it
quits, you know, for the year,

04:25.760 --> 04:28.440
so... just so
everybody’s on board,

04:28.440 --> 04:30.070
and then I-I’m fine.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.780
Well, I disagree there.

04:31.780 --> 04:32.780
We’re not...

04:32.780 --> 04:35.380
nowhere near defeat,
but... (chuckles)

04:35.380 --> 04:38.550
What’s the point of being here
if we’re not going to try

04:38.550 --> 04:41.480
everything within our means

04:41.480 --> 04:42.710
to get an answer?

04:42.710 --> 04:46.420
You know me-- I’m not
a quitter, but... (chuckles)

04:46.420 --> 04:47.420
-I know.

04:47.420 --> 04:50.610
-I-I’m gonna defer to you guys.

04:50.610 --> 04:52.680
RICK:
I don’t like to fail,

04:52.680 --> 04:57.440
and I don’t like, uh, giving up,

04:57.440 --> 05:01.270
and all of those things
are probably helpful

05:01.270 --> 05:03.440
in this endeavor on Oak Island,

05:03.440 --> 05:05.520
but we are a team,

05:05.520 --> 05:07.890
and we will have to make
that assessment as a team.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.470
Well, you know, Churchill said,

05:09.470 --> 05:11.050
"When you’re going
through hell,

05:11.050 --> 05:12.100
well, you better keep going."

05:12.100 --> 05:14.140
(chuckling): So that’s kind of
what’s going on here.

05:14.140 --> 05:15.140
-Yeah.

05:15.140 --> 05:18.680
You know we’re not gonna
make any more time.

05:18.680 --> 05:21.450
You know what Dad
always said, you know.

05:21.450 --> 05:22.450
-Nobody gets...

05:22.450 --> 05:23.450
-Can’t beat time.

05:23.450 --> 05:24.450
Can’t beat Father Time, so...

05:25.450 --> 05:26.450
what are we gonna do?

05:27.150 --> 05:29.680
You know, here’s how I feel
about the whole thing.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.480
You know, I can feel...

05:31.580 --> 05:33.870
I can feel in my heart that,

05:33.970 --> 05:36.520
on an overall sense,

05:36.520 --> 05:40.230
I want to do everything we
possibly can this year because,

05:40.230 --> 05:43.139
you know, we’ve been at this
for a long time,

05:43.139 --> 05:44.200
we’re not getting any younger.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.020
I mean, for right now, though,

05:46.020 --> 05:47.240
I feel, like, let’s do it all.

05:47.240 --> 05:51.860
And even if that includes
resurrecting that damn swamp.

05:51.860 --> 05:54.520
NARRATOR:
Over the past six years,

05:54.520 --> 05:57.639
the Oak Island team has made
numerous discoveries

05:57.639 --> 06:00.190
in the mysterious
triangle-shaped swamp.

06:00.190 --> 06:01.230
-Is it a coin?

06:01.230 --> 06:02.770
-I believe this is a coin.

06:02.770 --> 06:04.650
NARRATOR:
From a Spanish pirate coin

06:04.650 --> 06:05.670
dated to 1652...

06:05.670 --> 06:07.450
Oh, look at that.

06:07.450 --> 06:08.450
That’s nice.

06:08.450 --> 06:10.910
NARRATOR:
...a large iron spike

06:10.910 --> 06:12.630
and a piece of deck planking.

06:12.630 --> 06:16.139
All of these finds
gave credence to the theory

06:16.139 --> 06:17.949
held by the late
treasure hunter

06:17.949 --> 06:21.381
and Oak Island land owner,
Fred Nolan, that the swamp

06:21.381 --> 06:24.800
may have been artificially
created centuries ago

06:24.800 --> 06:27.370
to hide a large sailing vessel.

06:27.370 --> 06:30.540
I like the idea of seismic
in the swamp.

06:30.540 --> 06:31.540
I do.

06:31.540 --> 06:34.100
And, I mean, I’m on board
for the... for the seismic, too.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.990
-Do we have permits?

06:35.990 --> 06:36.990
-RICK: Yes.

06:36.990 --> 06:38.830
I have all the permits.

06:38.830 --> 06:41.350
They’re waiting for us
to give them the okay.

06:41.350 --> 06:43.620
Yeah, they’ve done their
preliminary homework,

06:43.620 --> 06:46.080
and-and there should be
no problem on their end.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.080
Okay.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.270
-Ready to go?

06:48.270 --> 06:49.270
-Roger.

06:49.270 --> 06:50.450
Here it comes.

06:50.450 --> 06:52.479
NARRATOR:
Earlier this year,

06:52.479 --> 06:54.380
the Laginas and their partners

06:54.380 --> 06:56.260
worked with a team
from Eagle Canada

06:56.260 --> 06:58.090
out of Calgary, Alberta

06:58.090 --> 07:00.270
to conduct
a geophysical exploration

07:00.270 --> 07:04.990
of the Money Pit area
by means of seismic testing.

07:04.990 --> 07:09.100
By detonating more than
1,500 small explosive charges

07:09.100 --> 07:11.490
and measuring
the resulting sound waves

07:11.490 --> 07:13.440
as they traveled
through the earth,

07:13.440 --> 07:17.460
the team was able to generate a
virtual map of potential voids

07:17.460 --> 07:22.360
and man-made structures as deep
as 200 feet underground.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.820
This anomaly here,
very interesting.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.910
Is that consistent
with a chamber?

07:26.910 --> 07:27.910
-Yeah, it is.

07:27.910 --> 07:28.910
-Wow.

07:28.910 --> 07:31.820
NARRATOR:
But could this same process

07:31.820 --> 07:36.180
also help unravel the mystery
of the swamp once and for all?

07:36.180 --> 07:38.680
It’s always bittersweet for me

07:38.680 --> 07:41.240
to talk about doing something
in the wretched, fetid swamp,

07:41.240 --> 07:46.550
but in the cool light of day,
Rick is right,

07:46.550 --> 07:50.139
we have to make sure
we’ve searched it properly.

07:50.139 --> 07:51.139
Let’s go.

07:51.139 --> 07:52.139
Let’s do it.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.139
Let’s shoot it.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.199
Let’s dig the holes.

07:54.199 --> 07:55.490
Let’s find something.

07:55.490 --> 07:57.210
Let’s finish Smith’s Cove.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.800
Let’s beat ourselves to death

07:58.800 --> 07:59.800
-for two more weeks.

07:59.800 --> 08:00.800
-Uh, you know, I mean...

08:00.800 --> 08:01.800
-That’s how I feel right now.

08:01.800 --> 08:02.910
-As long as we’re all on board.

08:02.910 --> 08:04.251
RICK:
As long as we’re all in,

08:04.251 --> 08:06.139
and that would include
everybody else.

08:06.139 --> 08:07.370
Okay, make the deals.

08:07.370 --> 08:08.580
I’ll be out there soon.

08:08.580 --> 08:09.580
-CRAIG: Okay.

08:09.580 --> 08:10.580
-All right.

08:10.580 --> 08:11.639
-CRAIG: Sounds good.

08:11.639 --> 08:12.639
-See you.

08:12.639 --> 08:14.260
MARTY:
Full speed ahead.

08:14.260 --> 08:17.400
NARRATOR: Following his meeting
in the war room,

08:17.400 --> 08:21.420
Rick Lagina joins other members
of the team at Smith’s Cove,

08:21.420 --> 08:23.840
where they are continuing
their massive excavation

08:23.840 --> 08:25.840
of the beach area.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.720
RICK:
Nothing yet?

08:28.720 --> 08:30.120
Regret to inform,

08:30.120 --> 08:32.200
it doesn’t seem to continue
beyond the edge.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.200
All right.

08:34.100 --> 08:35.100
-Let’s start.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.100
-We’ll be ready.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.100
NARRATOR:
Three weeks ago,

08:37.100 --> 08:38.100
the Oak Island team

08:38.299 --> 08:39.600
began digging beneath the beach

08:39.600 --> 08:42.100
in order to remove
the wooden crane pad

08:42.400 --> 08:45.930
used to construct the cofferdam
that surrounds Smith’s Cove.

08:45.930 --> 08:49.420
It is here that the team hopes
to locate the place

08:49.420 --> 08:51.570
where the legendary
stone box drains,

08:51.570 --> 08:54.490
first discovered in 1850,

08:54.490 --> 08:56.180
converge into a single
flood tunnel,

08:56.180 --> 08:58.790
a flood tunnel
that the team hopes

08:58.790 --> 09:02.320
could lead them directly to
the Money Pit treasure vault.

09:04.420 --> 09:06.520
And there’s no metal
around here whatsoever.

09:07.220 --> 09:10.180
A few tiny little
pieces of iron,

09:10.180 --> 09:12.960
small, small,
around where the shaft is,

09:12.960 --> 09:14.230
but there’s just nothing.

09:14.230 --> 09:16.320
You find anything
on the wash plant?

09:23.820 --> 09:24.350
TERRY:
Oh.

09:24.650 --> 09:26.080
Piece of wood?

09:26.080 --> 09:30.232
It looks like we found
another structure.

09:31.032 --> 09:32.032
-So we have.

09:32.032 --> 09:33.032
-Yeah.

09:34.132 --> 09:35.632
NARRATOR:
Another wooden structure?

09:35.632 --> 09:38.480
Could it have been placed here
by previous searchers

09:38.980 --> 09:41.170
in an attempt to block
the flood tunnel

09:41.170 --> 09:42.910
leading to the Money Pit?

09:42.910 --> 09:45.160
Or could it be much older

09:45.160 --> 09:47.270
and connected to
the flood tunnel itself?

09:47.270 --> 09:50.589
GARY:
Wait a day, and we’ll

09:50.589 --> 09:52.250
find another structure.

09:52.250 --> 09:55.020
RICK:
Wow, look at that.

09:55.020 --> 09:56.680
-Lots of sand.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.680
-Interesting.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.320
Those stones look like they were
placed there above it.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.820
NARRATOR:
Placed stones?

10:02.820 --> 10:04.959
When the five finger-like
stone box drains

10:04.959 --> 10:07.430
were first discovered in 1850

10:07.430 --> 10:09.149
by members of
the Truro Company,

10:09.149 --> 10:11.589
they were reported
to be constructed

10:11.589 --> 10:17.120
out of large, flat rocks with
smaller ones packed inside.

10:17.120 --> 10:19.060
Could these stones
be more evidence

10:19.060 --> 10:21.080
that the structure
the team has found

10:21.080 --> 10:23.670
is associated with
the main flood tunnel?

10:23.670 --> 10:25.690
It’s pretty sticky stuff.

10:25.690 --> 10:28.220
See how far it goes.

10:28.220 --> 10:31.500
All right, just cut along
the face of it.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.550
Yeah, and sift out, maybe.

10:35.450 --> 10:37.230
(crunching)

10:42.530 --> 10:43.310
-Whoa.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.090
-Whoa.

10:44.090 --> 10:45.050
Whoa, okay.

10:46.550 --> 10:47.700
Look at this.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.830
Maybe this is one
of the walls.

10:51.830 --> 10:52.830
Look.

10:52.830 --> 10:53.830
-That’d be a piece here,
hand a piece here.

10:53.830 --> 10:54.530
-Yeah, looks like it, yeah.

10:56.730 --> 10:59.300
Well, dig it out
and see what it looks like.

11:03.400 --> 11:04.380
Uh, perfect timing.

11:04.380 --> 11:06.220
You show up
when we find a structure.

11:06.220 --> 11:08.860
If structures were treasure,
we’d be rich.

11:08.860 --> 11:09.860
(laughter)

11:17.260 --> 11:18.260
TERRY:
Here it is.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.690
Here it is, here.

11:19.690 --> 11:20.860
-LAIRD: Got it?

11:20.860 --> 11:23.070
There’s the length of It
right there.

11:23.070 --> 11:25.609
NARRATOR: At Smith’s Cove,
members of the Oak Island team

11:25.709 --> 11:27.459
are continuing to uncover

11:27.459 --> 11:29.930
another mysterious
wooden structure.

11:32.230 --> 11:33.380
Oh, looks like it continues.

11:36.580 --> 11:37.930
LAIRD:
I just want to see if there’s...

11:37.930 --> 11:38.930
see if there’s a corner.

11:41.530 --> 11:42.530
TERRY:
Billy!

11:42.530 --> 11:45.430
Would you push that back so we
can see if there’s a wall there?

11:51.030 --> 11:51.830
-Perfect.

11:51.830 --> 11:52.630
Perfect.

11:52.630 --> 11:53.630
-(soft laughter)

11:53.630 --> 11:55.130
The quest for corner
I think has been found.

11:56.930 --> 11:58.190
There’s a corner right there.

11:58.190 --> 11:59.900
GARY:
Well, this-this is

11:59.900 --> 12:01.609
really entrenched, isn’t it?

12:01.609 --> 12:02.900
TERRY:
Particularly, yes.

12:02.900 --> 12:03.900
Well entrenched.

12:04.300 --> 12:06.660
Give it... give it
a little dig there.

12:08.000 --> 12:14.074

12:23.160 --> 12:24.830
TERRY:
What do you got there, Laird?

12:25.130 --> 12:26.430
LAIRD:
They’re like slats.

12:26.430 --> 12:28.020
TERRY:
It looks like they had

12:28.020 --> 12:29.750
a picket fence around it.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.850
GARY:
Yeah, that’s what it looks like.

12:31.850 --> 12:33.250
LAIRD:
Yeah.

12:36.450 --> 12:37.450
GARY:
That is...

12:37.450 --> 12:38.860
I never
expected to see that.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.160
-That’s bizarre, isn’t it?
-(laughter)

12:40.160 --> 12:40.780
LAIRD:
It doesn’t look

12:40.780 --> 12:42.299
real structural, does it?

12:43.699 --> 12:45.020
Purposeful for something, right?

12:45.020 --> 12:46.020
But what?

12:46.920 --> 12:48.209
GARY:
There’s four sides.

12:48.209 --> 12:49.990
This is another shaft.

12:49.990 --> 12:52.540
NARRATOR:
Another shaft,

12:52.540 --> 12:54.260
buried at Smith’s Cove?

12:54.260 --> 12:58.990
If it predates the discovery
of the Money Pit in 1795,

12:58.990 --> 13:01.550
the Laginas and their team
may have just made

13:01.550 --> 13:03.760
a breakthrough discovery.

13:03.760 --> 13:07.310
Perhaps one that could lead
them to the main flood tunnel

13:07.310 --> 13:09.790
connected directly
to the Money Pit.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.620
-If we clean that wall up...

13:12.620 --> 13:13.620
-Yeah?

13:13.620 --> 13:14.620
-Right here?

13:14.620 --> 13:16.339
-Clean it back.

13:16.339 --> 13:19.660
We’ll clean this up
and then photograph it.

13:19.660 --> 13:20.660
Yeah.

13:20.660 --> 13:21.850
LAIRD:
Just when you thought it

13:21.850 --> 13:23.350
couldn’t get any weirder.

13:23.350 --> 13:24.850
TERRY:
Yeah.

13:24.850 --> 13:26.810
NARRATOR:
While efforts to locate

13:26.810 --> 13:31.430
the main flood tunnel
continue at Smith’s Cove,

13:31.430 --> 13:34.850
Rick Lagina, Craig Tester
and other members of the team

13:34.850 --> 13:37.940
gather in the war room to meet
with Oak Island theorist

13:37.940 --> 13:38.940
Chris Donah.

13:38.940 --> 13:41.339
I want to introduce, uh,
Chris Donah

13:41.339 --> 13:42.339
-to everyone.

13:42.339 --> 13:43.339
-Hello.

13:43.339 --> 13:45.440
NARRATOR:
Chris has contacted Rick Lagina

13:45.440 --> 13:47.280
about new research concerning

13:47.280 --> 13:50.010
the mysterious
triangle-shaped swamp,

13:50.010 --> 13:53.399
which, in light of the team’s
upcoming seismic test,

13:53.399 --> 13:55.980
could prove more than valuable
to their operation.

13:55.980 --> 13:59.529
Since I’ve really started
working with Oak Island,

13:59.529 --> 14:01.390
I got into the meat
of astronomy.

14:01.390 --> 14:03.290
I’ve really learned a lot
about constellations.

14:03.290 --> 14:05.529
They’re a creation by man.

14:05.529 --> 14:07.730
You know, they’re there
with a purpose,

14:07.730 --> 14:09.959
not just a picture.

14:09.959 --> 14:12.510
Some people think that that’s
where the secret knowledge is,

14:12.510 --> 14:14.730
in the constellations.

14:14.730 --> 14:16.220
So whoever was here

14:16.220 --> 14:20.709
used that information
to map out things on the island

14:20.709 --> 14:23.970
and create structures
around the island.

14:23.970 --> 14:26.350
I think it’s a roadmap, too,

14:26.350 --> 14:28.970
for what they did here,
and possibly lead

14:28.970 --> 14:31.980
to the treasure location
on the island.

14:31.980 --> 14:34.680
It’s like a treasure map.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.589
PAUL:
There is an esoteric saying

14:37.589 --> 14:39.779
-that goes:
As above, so below.

14:39.779 --> 14:40.779
-Yes.

14:40.779 --> 14:45.250
And this is a classic meaning
to that.

14:45.250 --> 14:48.160
NARRATOR:
Many researchers,

14:48.160 --> 14:49.839
and even some scientists,

14:49.839 --> 14:52.990
have speculated,
based on careful study,

14:52.990 --> 14:55.550
that the key to solving
the Oak Island mystery

14:55.550 --> 15:00.970
may not lie underground,
but rather somewhere above.

15:00.970 --> 15:02.790
Including the night sky.

15:02.790 --> 15:05.840
PETTER:
This is Nolan’s Cross.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.990
NARRATOR:
Over the past six years,

15:08.990 --> 15:12.170
Rick, Marty and the team
have heard numerous theories

15:12.170 --> 15:13.690
connecting the constellations,

15:13.690 --> 15:16.630
not only to important landmarks

15:16.630 --> 15:18.430
such as
the megalithic formation

15:18.430 --> 15:23.709
known as Nolan’s Cross,
but also to a massive star map

15:23.709 --> 15:27.010
corresponding to points
across the entire island.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.310
TRAVIS: If we follow
the right procedure,

15:29.310 --> 15:32.160
we might be led
to the point on Oak Island

15:32.160 --> 15:33.860
where the actual treasure is.

15:33.860 --> 15:36.760
I don’t know if you guys
are familiar

15:36.760 --> 15:39.050
with the Royal Arch or not,
of Freemasonry.

15:39.050 --> 15:40.769
It’s very big.

15:40.769 --> 15:43.000
It’s also celestial,

15:43.000 --> 15:44.380
and it starts with Leo
at the top,

15:44.380 --> 15:47.269
and then it talks about the
three pillars of Freemasonry:

15:47.269 --> 15:49.700
strength, which is Leo;

15:49.700 --> 15:52.149
uh, Libra is wisdom;

15:52.149 --> 15:55.070
and Aries over here is beauty.

15:55.070 --> 15:59.540
But it’s the arch
of the zodiac, actually.

15:59.540 --> 16:02.890
NARRATOR:
For more than two centuries,

16:02.890 --> 16:04.889
the ancient order
of Freemasonry

16:04.889 --> 16:09.730
has been closely intertwined
with the Oak Island mystery.

16:09.730 --> 16:13.220
Many prominent treasure hunters
such as Daniel McGinnis,

16:13.220 --> 16:16.649
M.R. Chappell and even
future U.S. president

16:16.649 --> 16:19.230
Franklin Delano Roosevelt
were members.

16:19.230 --> 16:22.970
There have also been several
well-known masonic symbols

16:22.970 --> 16:26.079
documented on
and around Oak Island,

16:26.079 --> 16:27.630
including the sacred letter G,

16:27.630 --> 16:30.930
as well as
the triangle or pyramid,

16:30.930 --> 16:34.250
which appears not only
in numerous stone carvings

16:34.250 --> 16:39.360
but also in the shape
of the mysterious swamp.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.750
Virgo is a very important
female constellation.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.010
It’s the only female
constellation

16:44.010 --> 16:47.230
in, uh, the zodiac.

16:47.230 --> 16:50.680
And Spica, the main star
that’s in her hand,

16:50.680 --> 16:54.750
is very strong
in Freemasonry symbolism.

16:54.750 --> 16:58.709
I always think of it
as being the swamp.

16:58.709 --> 17:00.330
Uh, as a womb.

17:00.330 --> 17:03.980
That is like Eve
of Adam and Eve.

17:03.980 --> 17:04.980
Mary.

17:04.980 --> 17:09.679
Any positive female, uh,
representation is Virgo.

17:09.679 --> 17:12.980
That sets right over the swamp.

17:12.980 --> 17:17.240
The path of the sun passes
through that corner of Virgo,

17:17.240 --> 17:21.179
and Spica lays right on
that southeast corner

17:21.179 --> 17:25.179
of that swamp as it sets.

17:25.179 --> 17:26.310
-What is the purpose?

17:26.310 --> 17:27.540
-My guess would be--

17:27.540 --> 17:30.400
along that eastern edge
of the swamp,

17:30.400 --> 17:31.400
there’s got to be something.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.020
There’s got to be a back door

17:33.020 --> 17:35.540
through that way
to the Money Pit.

17:35.540 --> 17:39.370
NARRATOR:
A back door to the Money Pit?

17:39.370 --> 17:42.370
Could the constellation Virgo

17:42.370 --> 17:45.780
really be used as a star map
corresponding to points

17:45.780 --> 17:51.060
throughout the mysterious
triangle-shaped swamp?

17:51.060 --> 17:53.799
One of which was meant
to mark a secret entrance

17:53.799 --> 17:56.720
to the original Money Pit
treasure vault?

17:56.720 --> 18:01.470
That’s definitely
the closest point to where,

18:01.470 --> 18:05.059
if the swamp was man-made,
have an access point.

18:05.059 --> 18:07.540
Maybe that would be it.

18:07.540 --> 18:11.240
We can tell you this:
that we were out there,

18:11.240 --> 18:14.820
we found a rock
about as big as this table,

18:14.820 --> 18:18.100
-as long as this table,
easily this width.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.100
-Mm-hmm.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.050
You could slide a rebar
across it,

18:21.050 --> 18:24.980
smooth as... smooth as the top
of this table.

18:24.980 --> 18:26.530
You got stuff here, buddy.

18:26.530 --> 18:27.530
-There’s something there?

18:27.530 --> 18:28.530
-Yeah.

18:28.530 --> 18:29.660
NARRATOR: While investigating
the southeast corner

18:29.660 --> 18:34.559
of the swamp five years ago,
Rick Lagina, Charles Barkhouse

18:34.559 --> 18:38.110
and metal detection expert
Steve Zazulyk identified

18:38.110 --> 18:40.790
a large, nonferrous signal,

18:40.790 --> 18:44.230
indicating the possible
presence of gold or silver.

18:44.230 --> 18:46.060
-This is what you wanted, right?

18:46.060 --> 18:47.280
-That’s what I want.

18:47.280 --> 18:48.590
NARRATOR:
However, when the team

18:48.590 --> 18:49.690
attempted to retrieve

18:49.690 --> 18:51.610
the precious objects
with the help

18:51.610 --> 18:54.420
of professional diver
Tony Sampson...

18:54.420 --> 18:55.420
-He’s coming up.

18:55.420 --> 18:57.799
-...the signal
mysteriously disappeared,

18:57.799 --> 19:00.400
and their search instead
produced nothing more

19:00.400 --> 19:03.970
than a mysterious line of flat
rocks on the mucky bottom.

19:03.970 --> 19:06.520
I have no idea
what to make of it.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.940
NARRATOR:
Could these stones have

19:07.940 --> 19:09.169
actually been evidence

19:09.169 --> 19:14.049
of a tunnel or passageway
buried beneath the swamp?

19:14.049 --> 19:17.600
One built as an access point
to the original Money Pit?

19:17.600 --> 19:19.690
And if so,

19:19.690 --> 19:23.400
might seismic scanning
of the area confirm it?

19:23.400 --> 19:27.200
The east side of that swamp
is definitely...

19:27.200 --> 19:29.460
should be investigated
for any tunnels.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.650
There’s got to be a back door
through that way.

19:32.650 --> 19:34.620
DOUG:
I’m impressed by that.

19:34.620 --> 19:35.790
That’s cool.

19:35.790 --> 19:38.840
What’s buried here,
I don’t know.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.900
But all I know is that
it was important to them,

19:41.900 --> 19:44.000
and hopefully, it’s still here.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.470
RICK:
It’s the reason why you’re here.

19:46.470 --> 19:48.720
You’re not new with, uh...

19:48.720 --> 19:50.390
You know,
I don’t exactly know who,

19:50.390 --> 19:53.100
I don’t exactly know when,
but this is what I believe

19:53.100 --> 19:54.390
based upon my studies,

19:54.390 --> 19:56.370
and that’s why we invite
people like yourself

19:56.370 --> 19:58.990
to come to the island,
because we have yet to answer

19:58.990 --> 20:01.530
-who, what, when,
where, why and how.

20:01.530 --> 20:02.530
-Right.

20:02.530 --> 20:03.530
RICK:
To that end,

20:03.530 --> 20:10.330
I think we have our work
cut out for us.

20:10.330 --> 20:12.120
Sure do.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.800
-RICK: Let’s go.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.470
-DOUG: All right.

20:17.470 --> 20:19.580
NARRATOR:
As a new day begins

20:19.580 --> 20:20.820
on Oak Island...

20:20.820 --> 20:21.910
-RICK: There he is.

20:21.910 --> 20:23.270
-Hey, guys, how you doing?

20:23.270 --> 20:24.270
He’s actually smiling.

20:24.270 --> 20:26.550
Did you
take a real hard look out here?

20:26.550 --> 20:28.250
NARRATOR: ...Rick Lagina,
Dave Blankenship

20:28.250 --> 20:30.480
and Charles Barkhouse
welcome back

20:30.480 --> 20:33.200
representatives
from Eagle Canada,

20:33.200 --> 20:35.260
who have returned
to begin preparations

20:35.260 --> 20:39.309
for a seismic survey
of the triangle-shaped swamp.

20:39.309 --> 20:40.640
What-what is
your first impression?

20:40.640 --> 20:43.120
I think it’s gonna be
manageable for us.

20:43.120 --> 20:47.150
I’m hoping your-your...
you guys feel the same way.

20:47.150 --> 20:49.570
-(laughter)
-We’ve got, um,

20:49.570 --> 20:50.919
three-eighths-inch plywood
there.

20:50.919 --> 20:51.919
-Yeah.

20:51.919 --> 20:54.420
-Uh, we’d be happy to help,
uh, plank it out.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.480
-We did do that.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.480
Right, Charles?

20:56.480 --> 20:57.480
And it... and it...

20:57.480 --> 20:58.480
-CHARLES: Yeah.

20:58.480 --> 20:59.480
We’ve done it
a number of times.

20:59.480 --> 21:02.169
I’d say 80% of that
is-is easily walkable.

21:02.169 --> 21:05.650
Areas where that darker
color is, that’s soup.

21:05.650 --> 21:07.860
NARRATOR:
In advance of the operation,

21:07.860 --> 21:11.360
the Oak Island team
has spent the last two days

21:11.360 --> 21:14.750
draining the entire
four-and-a-half-acre swamp.

21:14.750 --> 21:18.140
However, in order to create
a workable surface area

21:18.140 --> 21:19.700
for the Eagle Canada team,

21:19.700 --> 21:23.660
sheets of plywood have been
laid across the muck and mud.

21:23.660 --> 21:26.420
So we’ll do everything we can
to get points in there,

21:26.420 --> 21:28.620
but some we would just...
we would put stub lines in

21:28.620 --> 21:29.880
and move them out a little bit.

21:29.880 --> 21:30.880
-Yeah.

21:30.880 --> 21:31.880
-We’ll see.

21:31.880 --> 21:32.880
-If we have to,

21:32.880 --> 21:33.880
we can change
the program around,

21:33.880 --> 21:34.880
just to suit the conditions.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.660
We’ll start in the west...
west edge of the swamp here.

21:36.660 --> 21:37.660
We’ll work our way east.

21:37.660 --> 21:39.789
How are you gonna
deal with this?

21:39.789 --> 21:41.600
Because it literally
is a peat bog.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.059
CLINT:
Yeah, well, we got... we got

21:43.059 --> 21:44.059
big poles to plant these phones.

21:44.059 --> 21:45.750
It’s not like the ones
you guys have seen,

21:45.750 --> 21:47.240
which we use in the mega-bin
and the Money Pit,

21:47.240 --> 21:49.429
where you’d sort of plant
with hand and then use

21:49.429 --> 21:51.850
the orientation tool
to align them.

21:51.850 --> 21:54.289
These got longer leads on them,
and we’ll have poles.

21:54.289 --> 21:55.289
We can get extensions.

21:55.289 --> 21:56.299
We can put them down.

21:56.299 --> 21:57.650
If they’re all at
different depths,

21:57.650 --> 21:59.140
doesn’t really...
doesn’t really, uh,

21:59.140 --> 22:00.520
affect the data or anything,

22:00.520 --> 22:02.320
so we’ll-we’ll get them
down there.

22:02.320 --> 22:03.320
Okay.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.000
I’m sure you’re antsy
to get going.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.770
The plywood we have
is down there.

22:06.770 --> 22:07.770
-Okay.

22:07.770 --> 22:08.770
Excellent.

22:08.770 --> 22:09.770
-All right.

22:09.770 --> 22:10.770
Sounds good.

22:10.770 --> 22:11.770
NARRATOR:
Although some 1,500

22:11.770 --> 22:12.770
dynamite charges

22:12.770 --> 22:15.020
were set off
over the Money Pit area,

22:15.020 --> 22:17.350
the seismic operation
in the swamp

22:17.350 --> 22:19.929
will require more than 2,000,

22:19.929 --> 22:21.870
placed approximately
two feet deep

22:21.870 --> 22:23.330
in the muddy ground.

22:23.330 --> 22:26.990
They will also stage 4,000
recording devices,

22:26.990 --> 22:30.720
known as geophones,
spaced two meters apart

22:30.720 --> 22:32.400
in a designated grid pattern.

22:32.400 --> 22:33.539
RICK:
Okay.

22:33.539 --> 22:34.679
Good luck.

22:34.679 --> 22:37.410
NARRATOR:
As the team from Eagle Canada

22:37.410 --> 22:41.460
continues to prepare
the seismic operation,

22:41.460 --> 22:44.880
Marty Lagina and metal
detection expert Gary Drayton

22:44.880 --> 22:47.539
arrive at Lot 27,

22:47.539 --> 22:50.480
where they have transported
spoils taken from the swamp

22:50.480 --> 22:53.169
during the team’s recent
efforts to drain the area.

22:53.169 --> 22:55.490
MARTY:
So, do you want

22:55.490 --> 22:58.280
to search it first, and then

22:58.280 --> 22:59.930
-I’ll start spreading it around?

22:59.930 --> 23:00.930
-Yeah.

23:00.930 --> 23:04.419
Yeah, the oldest stuff
come from a really great area.

23:04.419 --> 23:06.700
When Billy was putting
the pumps in

23:06.700 --> 23:08.440
on the edge of the swamp there,

23:08.440 --> 23:12.830
he noticed that it
had been disturbed.

23:12.830 --> 23:16.850
He figures that someone had been
previously digging there.

23:16.850 --> 23:17.850
MARTY:
Okay, so what do you

23:17.850 --> 23:18.850
want me to do?

23:18.850 --> 23:20.610
-GARY: Just rake this over.

23:20.610 --> 23:21.610
-Yeah.

23:21.610 --> 23:22.830
All right.

23:22.830 --> 23:25.110
NARRATOR:
As Marty uses the excavator

23:25.110 --> 23:28.840
to spread the spoils out,
Gary will scan the material

23:28.840 --> 23:30.400
with his metal detector

23:30.400 --> 23:32.980
in the hopes of finding
any important clues

23:32.980 --> 23:37.059
or potentially
valuable objects.

23:37.059 --> 23:39.419
-Oh.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.780
-(beeping)

23:41.780 --> 23:43.220
Got a target here.

23:43.220 --> 23:46.970
-(beeping)
-It’s not very deep.

23:46.970 --> 23:49.980
Three or four inches.

23:49.980 --> 23:51.500
Right in the deer track.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.500
This here.

23:52.500 --> 23:53.720
-Oh, I see it.

23:53.720 --> 23:54.830
I see it.

23:54.830 --> 23:56.309
-What you got, Gary?

23:56.309 --> 23:57.780
Look, look at that.

23:57.780 --> 24:03.070
Is it a coin?

24:03.070 --> 24:04.070
Is it a coin?

24:04.070 --> 24:05.070
It is.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.070
-I think it’s a coin, yeah!

24:06.070 --> 24:07.070
-Or is it a button?

24:07.070 --> 24:08.070
-A coin or a button?

24:08.070 --> 24:09.230
-No, I think that’s a button.

24:09.230 --> 24:12.340
It’s got a border
all the way around.

24:12.340 --> 24:13.660
GARY:
Yeah, that’s an oldie as well.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.190
That’s a 1700s button, that is.

24:16.190 --> 24:17.190
-That’s nice.

24:17.190 --> 24:18.190
-It is.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.570
Keep going, though, then.

24:19.570 --> 24:21.669
It’s always fun to watch Gary

24:21.669 --> 24:24.730
get excited, you know, and in
this case, it was a button.

24:24.730 --> 24:26.299
Uh, and he thought quite old.

24:26.299 --> 24:27.770
We’ll have to clean it up
and see,

24:27.770 --> 24:29.919
but it’s always a pleasure
to dig in the swamp

24:29.919 --> 24:31.039
without being in the swamp.

24:31.039 --> 24:32.909
I’d do it any day.

24:32.909 --> 24:34.120
(beeping)

24:34.120 --> 24:38.980
MARTY:
That sounds good.

24:38.980 --> 24:42.620
Yeah, it does.

24:42.620 --> 24:45.039
Two-way repeatable.

24:45.039 --> 24:47.470
Seven inches.

24:47.470 --> 24:53.830
Yeah, I think it’s
a shotgun shell.

24:53.830 --> 24:55.610
No, it isn’t.

24:55.610 --> 24:57.400
-No, it isn’t.

24:57.400 --> 24:58.400
-No, that isn’t.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.690
That’s-that’s a coin
or a token.

24:59.690 --> 25:01.110
MARTY:
That’s pretty cool, Gary.

25:01.110 --> 25:02.110
-That is.

25:02.110 --> 25:03.110
-I would say it...

25:03.110 --> 25:06.130
you know, you’re, uh,
often saying... things are...

25:06.130 --> 25:07.880
I’d say that’s real old.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.880
Yeah, I mean, that does...
that looks old.

25:10.880 --> 25:13.910
I know back in the day,
mainly 16-1700s...

25:13.910 --> 25:14.910
-Mm-hmm?

25:14.910 --> 25:16.590
-What they used to do

25:16.590 --> 25:19.659
in, uh, the colonies,
’cause they didn’t like

25:19.659 --> 25:20.659
-the king or the queen...

25:20.659 --> 25:21.359
-Yeah, would punch the...

25:21.359 --> 25:21.859
Yeah.

25:21.859 --> 25:22.859
-Punch through the portrait.

25:22.859 --> 25:23.859
-But it was still currency.

25:23.859 --> 25:24.859
GARY:
Yeah, but it was still currency.

25:25.659 --> 25:28.830
And-and I believe this is
possibly one of those

25:28.830 --> 25:29.830
-type of coins.

25:29.830 --> 25:30.830
-Mm-hmm.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.200
NARRATOR:
A coin?

25:32.200 --> 25:33.200
Possibly dating back

25:33.200 --> 25:36.670
as early as the 1600s?

25:36.670 --> 25:38.010
Although antique coins

25:38.010 --> 25:40.960
are commonly found
on Oak Island,

25:40.960 --> 25:43.710
the fact that this one
was recovered from the swamp

25:43.710 --> 25:46.419
makes it a potentially
important clue.

25:46.419 --> 25:49.340
If this coin can be
positively identified,

25:49.340 --> 25:53.001
it might be key in suggesting
who may have visited Oak Island

25:53.001 --> 25:56.490
before 1795 and was behind

25:56.490 --> 25:58.780
the 223-year-old mystery.

25:58.780 --> 26:02.320
MARTY:
Uh, hey, you know what?

26:02.320 --> 26:05.200
I hate like hell to say this,

26:05.200 --> 26:07.340
but maybe there are answers
in the swamp.

26:07.340 --> 26:08.340
It’ll be interesting to see what

26:08.340 --> 26:09.669
the seismic says--
that is for sure.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.440
Yes, and then the seismic
will show, you know,

26:11.440 --> 26:12.950
you’re kind of doing
the top layer,

26:12.950 --> 26:14.929
and the seismic
will show what’s deep.

26:14.929 --> 26:17.010
All right, let’s go tell
Rick and the guys

26:17.010 --> 26:18.010
-what we found.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.010
-Okay.

26:19.010 --> 26:20.010
Let’s go.

26:20.010 --> 26:21.010
-CRAIG: Hey, Alex.

26:21.010 --> 26:23.340
-ALEX G.: Hey, how you doing?

26:23.340 --> 26:24.340
-Hey, Alex.

26:24.340 --> 26:26.900
-Looks like you’re about ready.

26:26.900 --> 26:27.900
Yeah.

26:27.900 --> 26:29.500
NARRATOR:
It is the start

26:29.500 --> 26:32.070
of an exciting day
on Oak Island,

26:32.070 --> 26:34.390
as Rick Lagina, Craig Tester

26:34.390 --> 26:37.539
and other members of the team
gather at the swamp,

26:37.539 --> 26:39.340
where representatives
from Eagle Canada

26:39.340 --> 26:44.370
are about to begin a seismic
survey of the entire area.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.190
ALEX G.:
We have enough gear

26:46.190 --> 26:47.190
on the ground

26:47.190 --> 26:48.549
so we can start shooting.

26:48.549 --> 26:49.750
So we’re on schedule.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.060
A good rule of thumb

26:51.060 --> 26:53.460
is don’t move
if the shooters are not moving.

26:53.460 --> 26:57.760
We’re gonna start on the
northwest corner of the swamp.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.990
Uh, we’ll have five shooters
on five different lines.

27:00.990 --> 27:02.660
So they’ll make their way down,

27:02.660 --> 27:05.140
and we’ll finish
on the beach road here.

27:05.140 --> 27:08.130
How many shots in total
are we taking this time?

27:08.130 --> 27:09.330
2,025.

27:09.330 --> 27:10.530
Wow.

27:10.530 --> 27:13.270
We’re probably gonna do about,

27:13.270 --> 27:15.440
uh, 300 shots today, so...

27:15.440 --> 27:17.870
we’re good to go whenever
you guys are good to go.

27:17.870 --> 27:18.950
I’m more than ready.

27:18.950 --> 27:21.850
I think the swamp has answers,
and I want them.

27:21.850 --> 27:24.020
NARRATOR:
Now that over 2,000

27:24.020 --> 27:25.020
explosive charges,

27:25.020 --> 27:27.799
each armed with 20 grams
of dynamite,

27:27.799 --> 27:29.950
have been placed
throughout the swamp,

27:29.950 --> 27:32.470
they will be detonated
one at a time

27:32.470 --> 27:36.510
from the command center
located nearby on Center Road.

27:36.510 --> 27:37.570
-Hi, Jeff.

27:37.570 --> 27:39.700
-How are you today?

27:39.700 --> 27:40.700
Good.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.830
How are you?

27:41.830 --> 27:42.830
Good.

27:42.830 --> 27:44.350
Just getting rolling.

27:44.350 --> 27:48.030
Okay, everybody, steady up.

27:48.030 --> 27:50.800
Here it comes.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.640
Steady up.

27:52.640 --> 27:57.059
NARRATOR:
As each blast sends sound waves

27:57.059 --> 28:00.000
deep below the surface
of the swamp...

28:00.000 --> 28:01.909
...they will be measured

28:01.909 --> 28:05.860
and recorded
by geophone receivers.

28:05.860 --> 28:08.970
Unlike more common
large-scale seismic tests,

28:08.970 --> 28:12.740
which are used to scan as deep
as six miles underground,

28:12.740 --> 28:15.429
these geophones have been
specially calibrated

28:15.429 --> 28:19.669
to create a diagram of the area
from 15 to 85 feet deep

28:19.669 --> 28:22.360
beneath the swamp.

28:22.360 --> 28:25.180
It is the team’s hope

28:25.180 --> 28:28.799
that this diagram will reveal
any man-made objects

28:28.799 --> 28:31.740
or possible structures
that might lie hidden there.

28:31.740 --> 28:33.630
Okay, you guys can move
out there.

28:33.630 --> 28:34.630
RICK:
There are lot of

28:34.630 --> 28:35.900
questions that still remain

28:35.900 --> 28:37.260
regarding the swamp.

28:37.260 --> 28:39.070
Is the swamp man-made?

28:39.070 --> 28:40.409
Is it a way in

28:40.409 --> 28:45.120
to the Money Pit,
i.e., a back door?

28:45.120 --> 28:48.010
I think seismic is gonna reveal
some significant results,

28:48.010 --> 28:52.400
and I’m hoping we’ll see it.

28:52.400 --> 28:54.570
NARRATOR:
As the seismic operation

28:54.570 --> 28:56.070
at the swamp continues...

28:56.070 --> 28:57.409
-TERRY: Hey, Charles.

28:57.409 --> 28:58.750
-CHARLES: Hey, guys.

28:58.750 --> 29:00.809
NARRATOR:
...Charles Barkhouse joins

29:00.809 --> 29:02.940
geologist Terry Matheson

29:02.940 --> 29:06.409
and archaeologist Laird Niven
at Smith’s Cove,

29:06.409 --> 29:08.080
where they’re continuing
to excavate

29:08.080 --> 29:11.130
what they believe could be
the main flood tunnel,

29:11.130 --> 29:13.000
first discovered in 1850.

29:13.000 --> 29:17.080
If they are correct,
it could lead them directly

29:17.080 --> 29:19.130
to the original Money Pit.

29:19.130 --> 29:23.440
-CHARLES: What do you got?

29:23.440 --> 29:24.830
-TERRY: Another feature

29:24.830 --> 29:27.590
just about where
the Cat is right now.

29:27.590 --> 29:28.590
-Really?

29:28.590 --> 29:29.590
-Yeah.

29:29.590 --> 29:30.590
-Hit a few boards.

29:30.590 --> 29:31.590
-LAIRD: We’re just gonna

29:31.590 --> 29:33.059
carry on until we find
our next feature.

29:48.559 --> 29:49.440
You see the water?

29:51.440 --> 29:52.640
Yeah.

29:55.940 --> 29:56.949
-Ah, look at that.

29:56.949 --> 29:57.949
-Yeah.

29:57.949 --> 29:58.889
TERRY:
You see the water moving

29:58.889 --> 30:00.680
out of that...

30:00.680 --> 30:02.941
It actually looks like a pile
of boulders, doesn’t it?

30:03.941 --> 30:04.941
LAIRD:
Yeah.

30:04.941 --> 30:05.941
TERRY:
Now, that’s pretty wild,

30:05.941 --> 30:06.941
actually, isn’t it?

30:08.341 --> 30:10.341
NARRATOR:
Piled-up boulders with water

30:10.341 --> 30:11.341
flowing through them?

30:12.841 --> 30:14.041
Might the team have uncovered

30:14.241 --> 30:16.120
one of the five
stone box drains,

30:16.720 --> 30:20.160
first reported by
the Truro Company in 1850?

30:20.160 --> 30:24.500
If so, could they finally
be on the verge of locating

30:24.500 --> 30:27.420
the convergence point
to the main flood tunnel?

30:27.420 --> 30:30.710
TERRY:
Hey, Alex, how you doing?

30:30.710 --> 30:32.900
-ALEX: What’s up, guys?

30:32.900 --> 30:34.351
-Yeah, well, we notice...

30:34.351 --> 30:36.750
we noticed this, uh,
rusty concentration of rocks.

30:36.750 --> 30:37.770
-ALEX: Oh, yeah.

30:37.770 --> 30:39.790
-LAIRD: It’s really
the contrast, right?

30:39.790 --> 30:40.870
ALEX:
Right, what does that

30:40.870 --> 30:41.870
say to you?

30:41.870 --> 30:42.870
TERRY:
It’s a concentration of boulders

30:42.870 --> 30:44.590
sitting directly on top
of the sea horizon.

30:44.590 --> 30:45.590
LAIRD:
And water just pouring

30:45.590 --> 30:46.590
out of it...

30:46.590 --> 30:47.590
You got a lot of water movement.

30:47.590 --> 30:48.590
You see the coloration

30:48.590 --> 30:50.980
-as iron oxide’s coming out
of solution?

30:50.980 --> 30:51.980
-Mm-hmm.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.040
I don’t know what it all means.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.190
Heck of a lot of work
went on down here.

30:55.190 --> 30:56.190
LAIRD:
Heck of a lot of work

30:56.190 --> 30:57.190
at different times.

30:57.190 --> 30:58.190
CHARLES:
Undocumented work.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.190
-LAIRD: Yeah.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.190
-That’s the thing.

31:00.190 --> 31:01.190
TERRY:
Looks like it’s a pile of rocks

31:01.190 --> 31:02.690
where water’s flowing through.

31:02.690 --> 31:05.350
-So you think,
maybe the flood tunnel?

31:05.350 --> 31:06.920
-Yeah, exactly.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.140
COLIN:
The pattern is fitting

31:09.140 --> 31:10.140
really well

31:10.140 --> 31:11.270
with our master chronologies.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.690
-This is quite impressive.

31:13.690 --> 31:14.690
-Yeah.

31:14.690 --> 31:15.690
-It is original features.

31:15.690 --> 31:16.690
-Yes.

31:16.690 --> 31:18.470
-It predates the Money Pit.

31:18.470 --> 31:19.850
-Wow.

31:19.850 --> 31:24.970
-So you think,
maybe the flood tunnel?

31:24.970 --> 31:25.970
-Maybe.

31:25.970 --> 31:27.300
NARRATOR:
While excavating beneath

31:27.300 --> 31:29.760
the beach at Smith’s Cove,

31:29.760 --> 31:33.190
Alex Lagina,
geologist Terry Matheson

31:33.190 --> 31:36.740
Charles Barkhouse
and archaeologist Laird Niven

31:36.740 --> 31:40.130
have just made what could be
an important discovery.

31:40.130 --> 31:41.130
TERRY:
This is coarse,

31:41.130 --> 31:43.520
bouldery material
with water flowing through it.

31:43.520 --> 31:44.539
It starts to fit the model

31:44.539 --> 31:45.539
-that we’re... we’ve been
searching for.

31:45.539 --> 31:46.539
-Yeah.

31:46.539 --> 31:47.539
ALEX:
Right.

31:47.539 --> 31:48.760
I think we’re actually

31:48.760 --> 31:50.549
really close
to the convergence point.

31:50.549 --> 31:53.400
NARRATOR:
The convergence point?

31:53.400 --> 31:55.799
Could the team have actually
located the place

31:55.799 --> 31:58.059
where the legendary
stone box drains

31:58.059 --> 32:00.700
join to form
a single flood tunnel,

32:00.700 --> 32:02.500
leading directly
to the original

32:02.500 --> 32:04.309
Money Pit treasure shaft?

32:04.309 --> 32:05.760
-Hey, Rick.

32:05.760 --> 32:06.760
-So?

32:06.760 --> 32:07.910
LAIRD:
We just... we stopped

32:07.910 --> 32:08.910
at this feature

32:08.910 --> 32:09.960
because it’s unusual.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.280
We weren’t getting
a lot of rocks,

32:12.280 --> 32:15.440
but then we noticed
this iron-rich stuff

32:15.440 --> 32:16.581
and the water flowing from it,

32:16.581 --> 32:19.580
the concentration
of rocks, the contrasts...

32:19.580 --> 32:20.580
-RICK: Right.

32:20.580 --> 32:21.580
Significant.
-...on either side.

32:21.580 --> 32:22.700
TERRY:
You have undisturbed

32:22.700 --> 32:24.419
below it and natural,

32:24.419 --> 32:25.730
bedded sediments
from the beach above it.

32:25.730 --> 32:26.730
-RICK: Yeah.

32:26.730 --> 32:29.040
TERRY: It’s kind
of interesting,

32:29.040 --> 32:30.500
substantial amount of water
flowing out of it.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.580
-It seems like it’s going
that way.

32:32.580 --> 32:33.580
-LAIRD: Exactly.

32:33.580 --> 32:35.120
RICK:
So, what’s... what’s the idea?

32:35.120 --> 32:37.290
-Cut... cut in,
peel this back slowly?

32:37.290 --> 32:38.290
-Yeah.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.290
If it continued like that,

32:39.290 --> 32:40.910
it would become
a significant feature.

32:40.910 --> 32:42.289
Yeah, yeah.

32:42.289 --> 32:45.039
RICK:
Okay, continue forward.

32:45.039 --> 32:46.410
LAIRD:
Yeah.

32:46.410 --> 32:50.539
RICK:
I’ll be curious about that.

32:50.539 --> 32:51.919
LAIRD:
Yeah.

32:51.919 --> 32:56.000
NARRATOR: Before another day
comes to an end on Oak Island,

32:56.000 --> 33:00.539
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina
and their partner Craig Tester

33:00.539 --> 33:03.640
gather in the war room with
other members of their team

33:03.640 --> 33:05.799
for a much-anticipated meeting.

33:05.799 --> 33:09.179
Guys, this is the part of the
war room meetings I really like.

33:09.179 --> 33:11.690
We’ve got some information,
some results coming in

33:11.690 --> 33:12.840
on dendrochronology.

33:12.840 --> 33:14.820
Um, it’s specific.

33:14.820 --> 33:17.230
It’s to the wood we took out
at Smith’s Cove.

33:17.230 --> 33:19.861
I believe we sent samples
of the U-shaped structure,

33:19.861 --> 33:22.750
the L-shaped structure,
some of the walls

33:22.750 --> 33:24.260
that were more
dimensional lumber,

33:24.260 --> 33:26.399
so Professor Colin Laroque,

33:26.399 --> 33:27.980
with the University
of Saskatchewan,

33:27.980 --> 33:30.630
has analyzed everything,
and Jack, he’s standing by.

33:30.630 --> 33:31.990
-Can you get him
up on the screen?

33:31.990 --> 33:32.990
-Sure.

33:32.990 --> 33:34.970
MARTY:
Colin, how are you, sir?

33:34.970 --> 33:35.970
-Good.

33:35.970 --> 33:36.970
How are you guys?

33:36.970 --> 33:37.970
-Good, thank you.

33:37.970 --> 33:39.580
We’re looking forward
to the results.

33:39.580 --> 33:42.440
TERRY:
That’s quite a significant wall.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.240
This is totally undiscovered.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.720
NARRATOR:
Over the past three months,

33:46.720 --> 33:48.350
the Oak Island team

33:48.350 --> 33:50.990
has unearthed numerous
mysterious wooden structures,

33:50.990 --> 33:54.450
buried as much as ten feet
beneath the seabed

33:54.450 --> 33:57.070
at Smith’s Cove.

33:57.070 --> 34:00.670
In addition to finding
the U- and L-shaped structures,

34:00.670 --> 34:04.100
first discovered by
Dan Blankenship in the 1970s,

34:04.100 --> 34:07.289
the team uncovered the remains
of a massive slipway,

34:07.289 --> 34:09.679
or shipping ramp.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.489
With each new discovery,

34:11.489 --> 34:13.279
the Oak Island team extracted

34:13.279 --> 34:15.759
wood samples
for scientific testing

34:15.759 --> 34:18.399
in the hopes of obtaining
reliable dates

34:18.399 --> 34:20.728
as to when
they were constructed.

34:20.728 --> 34:24.779
These samples were then sent
to Dr. Colin Laroque,

34:24.779 --> 34:28.309
a professor of dendrochronology
and climate science

34:28.309 --> 34:30.478
at the University
of Saskatchewan.

34:30.478 --> 34:34.569
Hey, Colin, why don’t you
explain what you did, briefly,

34:34.569 --> 34:37.879
on preparing the wood and then,
uh, go ahead with the results?

34:37.879 --> 34:40.279
Okay, basically, many
of the samples that we saw

34:40.279 --> 34:43.489
were probably in salt water,
so we had to, you know--

34:43.489 --> 34:46.539
controlled oven setting--
sort of slowly dry them,

34:46.539 --> 34:49.389
and then we sawed them
into very flat surfaces

34:49.389 --> 34:52.199
to see the ring pattern
and, uh, figure out

34:52.199 --> 34:54.349
where the wood came from
in time.

34:54.349 --> 34:56.440
NARRATOR:
Dendrochronology,

34:56.440 --> 34:57.749
or tree ring dating,

34:57.749 --> 35:00.819
is a scientific method
studying the size

35:00.819 --> 35:03.019
and pattern of growth rings,

35:03.019 --> 35:07.190
which develop as a tree grows
over its lifetime.

35:07.190 --> 35:09.829
The process can
accurately determine

35:09.829 --> 35:11.460
not only the age of wood

35:11.460 --> 35:14.229
but when it was cut for use
in construction.

35:14.229 --> 35:16.891
CRAIG:
Why don’t you go through sample

35:16.891 --> 35:19.339
by sample and give the-the date?

35:19.339 --> 35:20.910
COLIN:
Okay, the first sample

35:20.910 --> 35:22.440
was number one.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.279
CRAIG:
Item one is a two-inch

35:24.279 --> 35:25.499
horizontal wall.

35:25.499 --> 35:26.940
COLIN:
Yeah, our initial

35:26.940 --> 35:27.940
assessment was that

35:27.940 --> 35:31.160
they were tamarack larch wood,
which is very common,

35:31.160 --> 35:33.359
especially
in the shipbuilding areas

35:33.359 --> 35:35.150
around in Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick.

35:35.150 --> 35:37.099
And that had a lot of rings.

35:37.099 --> 35:38.430
It had the most rings.

35:38.430 --> 35:40.339
It’s, uh,
one of our best samples.

35:40.339 --> 35:43.839
It looked dimensional, but we
couldn’t quite, uh, fit it in.

35:43.839 --> 35:46.579
It had a lot of wormholes
or the kind of holes

35:46.579 --> 35:48.660
that were dug in
by the burrowing creatures

35:48.660 --> 35:50.489
in the water, so, uh,

35:50.489 --> 35:52.410
we’re still kind of trying
to work on that,

35:52.410 --> 35:54.200
trying to see if we’re missing
some of the rings

35:54.200 --> 35:59.130
in some of the holes, and so,
uh, that one is still waiting.

35:59.130 --> 36:00.130
-Mm-hmm.

36:00.130 --> 36:01.880
-But sample seven,

36:01.880 --> 36:04.269
that was one of our more
confident samples.

36:04.269 --> 36:05.599
CRAIG:
Sample number seven

36:05.599 --> 36:06.599
is the slipway.

36:06.599 --> 36:09.530
It’s the north arm
on the east end.

36:09.530 --> 36:11.010
COLIN:
So the slipway,

36:11.010 --> 36:13.069
it was, we believe, red spruce.

36:13.069 --> 36:15.710
It’s reminiscent to some
of the samples we did

36:15.710 --> 36:18.880
in other areas of Halifax.

36:18.880 --> 36:25.410
We had a fairly strong date on,
and that’s 1771.

36:25.410 --> 36:26.609
Wow.

36:26.609 --> 36:31.960
COLIN: So the slipway,
we had a fairly strong date on.

36:31.960 --> 36:33.719
That’s-that’s 1771.

36:33.719 --> 36:34.719
-Great.

36:34.719 --> 36:35.969
-It is original features.

36:35.969 --> 36:36.969
-Yep.

36:36.969 --> 36:38.859
-Predates the Money Pit.

36:38.859 --> 36:39.859
Yes.

36:39.859 --> 36:41.420
NARRATOR:
In the War Room,

36:41.420 --> 36:44.180
Dr. Colin Laroque
has just shared

36:44.180 --> 36:47.519
an amazing scientific report
with Rick, Marty

36:47.519 --> 36:50.950
and members
of the Oak Island team.

36:50.950 --> 36:53.650
Using a dating process
known as dendrochronology,

36:53.650 --> 36:56.760
he has determined
that the slipway discovered

36:56.760 --> 37:01.950
at Smith’s Cove
was likely built in 1771,

37:01.950 --> 37:04.509
over two decades before
the original Money Pit

37:04.509 --> 37:07.680
was discovered in 1795.

37:07.680 --> 37:10.240
I did not expect that.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.240
I’ll be candid.

37:11.240 --> 37:13.989
COLIN: That was one
of our more confident...

37:13.989 --> 37:14.989
The pattern
is fitting really well

37:14.989 --> 37:17.069
with our, uh,
master chronologies.

37:17.069 --> 37:18.069
Wow.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.069
-That’s really cool.

37:19.069 --> 37:20.069
-Yeah.

37:20.069 --> 37:22.219
COLIN:
The two that are coming up next

37:22.219 --> 37:23.219
are actually

37:23.219 --> 37:24.259
some of the biggest samples--

37:24.259 --> 37:26.230
uh, sample eight
and sample nine,

37:26.230 --> 37:27.349
-we call them.

37:27.349 --> 37:28.349
-Sample number eight

37:28.349 --> 37:32.089
is the U-shaped structure,
and sample number nine

37:32.089 --> 37:34.719
is another piece
of the U-shaped structure.

37:34.719 --> 37:37.229
Yeah, those were
the bigger samples.

37:37.229 --> 37:40.849
Uh, quite well-preserved,
especially in the center,

37:40.849 --> 37:42.619
so we had really good rings.

37:42.619 --> 37:45.369
It was, we believe, red spruce.

37:45.369 --> 37:49.640
So, for both samples,
we had 1769.

37:49.640 --> 37:50.640
Wow.

37:50.640 --> 37:54.979
I don’t know if it’s part
of the slipway features,

37:54.979 --> 37:58.839
but it seems to all pointing
towards that 1770s area.

37:58.839 --> 38:01.000
-This is quite impressive.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.000
-Yeah.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.660
COLIN:
And, you know, people didn’t

38:04.660 --> 38:07.069
take the time and effort
to cut down a tree

38:07.069 --> 38:09.190
unless they were gonna use it
for something.

38:09.190 --> 38:10.190
-Yes.

38:10.190 --> 38:11.190
-And so,

38:11.190 --> 38:14.369
many of these trees are
kind of all in that ballpark

38:14.369 --> 38:16.119
of a few years in the 1770s,

38:16.119 --> 38:19.039
and so, I think that data
is telling us that time period.

38:19.039 --> 38:22.210
-I mean, that’s huge.

38:22.210 --> 38:23.210
-Yeah.

38:23.210 --> 38:28.490
We can pretty much be sure that
all that work in Smith’s Cove

38:28.490 --> 38:31.859
occurred in about 1770.

38:31.859 --> 38:33.269
-That’s pretty amazing.

38:33.269 --> 38:34.269
-Yeah.

38:34.269 --> 38:35.500
PAUL:
Well, if we can find

38:35.500 --> 38:36.500
more of that wood

38:36.500 --> 38:38.950
from the Money Pit
that dates to that same era,

38:38.950 --> 38:40.640
then we’ll have a bull’s-eye.

38:40.640 --> 38:41.640
-Yes.

38:41.640 --> 38:42.640
-And it ties in.

38:42.640 --> 38:43.640
-Yeah.

38:43.640 --> 38:44.640
-CRAIG: Hey, Colin,

38:44.640 --> 38:46.630
how accurate of a-a list
do you have

38:46.630 --> 38:48.900
-that you can compare it to?

38:48.900 --> 38:49.900
-COLIN: Right.

38:49.900 --> 38:53.809
The one, uh, red spruce
chronology that we were using,

38:53.809 --> 38:58.660
which is about a 550-year-old
tree that is still growing,

38:58.660 --> 39:00.640
and it matches with that.

39:00.640 --> 39:04.559
So something like, uh,
sample eight, we’re at probably

39:04.559 --> 39:09.800
99.999 sure that it sort of
ends in that 1770 time.

39:09.800 --> 39:10.800
Wow.

39:10.800 --> 39:11.900
-This is big.

39:11.900 --> 39:12.900
-Yeah.

39:12.900 --> 39:13.999
COLIN:
In these kind of things,

39:13.999 --> 39:14.999
they...

39:14.999 --> 39:16.670
they tend to, uh,
answer one question

39:16.670 --> 39:18.099
and-and raise
two or three others.

39:18.099 --> 39:19.809
-What a shock that is.

39:19.809 --> 39:20.809
-(laughter)

39:20.809 --> 39:22.430
MARTY:
Great work.

39:22.430 --> 39:24.450
I love the 99.99.

39:24.450 --> 39:27.440
We don’t...
we don’t get that ever.

39:27.440 --> 39:29.319
So, thanks for being in
on the quest.

39:29.319 --> 39:30.319
-You’re welcome.

39:30.319 --> 39:31.640
-All right, Colin.

39:31.640 --> 39:32.640
Thank you very much.

39:32.640 --> 39:33.640
We will be in touch.

39:33.640 --> 39:34.640
Really appreciate it.

39:34.640 --> 39:35.640
Excellent report.

39:35.640 --> 39:36.640
Thank you.

39:36.640 --> 39:37.640
Yeah.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.640
Thank you.

39:38.640 --> 39:39.640
You’re welcome.

39:39.640 --> 39:40.640
Take care, guys.

39:40.640 --> 39:41.640
That was good news
on the slipway.

39:41.640 --> 39:42.640
Yeah, and the slipway,
and the U-shaped structure,

39:42.640 --> 39:44.509
they all were put in
at the same time.

39:44.509 --> 39:45.509
-Yeah.

39:45.509 --> 39:46.509
-RICK: The obvious question is,

39:46.509 --> 39:48.829
now, do you both believe
there is something here?

39:48.829 --> 39:49.829
-Who?

39:49.829 --> 39:50.940
Who you looking at?

39:50.940 --> 39:51.940
-You.

39:51.940 --> 39:52.940
You.

39:52.940 --> 39:53.940
MARTY:
I believe that we have

39:53.940 --> 39:55.150
just found, uh, conclusive proof

39:55.150 --> 39:57.519
that not everything
we’re finding is searcher, okay?

39:57.519 --> 39:58.519
-Yeah.

39:58.519 --> 39:59.519
-Yeah.

39:59.519 --> 40:01.339
For me, this is the biggest
thing that’s happened

40:01.339 --> 40:03.119
since we started this quest.

40:03.119 --> 40:04.240
It’s amazing.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.170
I-I was about to say to Rick,

40:06.170 --> 40:09.359
turn to him and say "Look, it’s
time to turn this island over

40:09.359 --> 40:12.109
from the archaeologist
to the psychiatrist," because...

40:12.109 --> 40:15.859
-(laughs)
-First time I’ve heard that.

40:15.859 --> 40:18.369
Because... because this
isn’t making any sense.

40:18.369 --> 40:23.680
And then, at the 11th hour,
we find out

40:23.680 --> 40:25.529
something very significant
happened here

40:25.529 --> 40:30.999
25 to 30 years prior to
the discovery of the Money Pit,

40:30.999 --> 40:33.519
and it’s in Smith’s Cove.

40:33.519 --> 40:34.549
To me, that’s gigantic.

40:34.549 --> 40:38.410
Well, I have to say,
I’m impressed with this.

40:38.410 --> 40:40.150
-I’m happy
that you’re impressed.

40:40.150 --> 40:41.200
-I am impressed.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.759
Okay, so this
is great information.

40:42.759 --> 40:43.759
-Yeah.

40:43.759 --> 40:44.759
-All right, well, look, guys,

40:44.759 --> 40:45.759
-food for thought.

40:45.759 --> 40:46.759
Let’s go.

40:46.759 --> 40:47.759
-CRAIG: Okay.

40:47.759 --> 40:48.979
NARRATOR:
For Rick, Marty

40:48.979 --> 40:51.460
and the Oak Island team,

40:51.460 --> 40:54.209
the news that some of the
mysterious wooden structures

40:54.209 --> 40:57.579
at Smith’s Cove were built
decades before the discovery

40:57.579 --> 40:59.269
of the original Money Pit

40:59.269 --> 41:01.819
offers an extraordinary
breakthrough.

41:01.819 --> 41:05.799
It means that all
of the money and hard work

41:05.799 --> 41:10.069
that was invested
was not done in vain.

41:10.069 --> 41:12.650
Not only has the team found
hard evidence

41:12.650 --> 41:14.739
of a large engineering project

41:14.739 --> 41:17.880
that was undertaken
as early as 1769,

41:17.880 --> 41:21.269
but the additional evidence
they’ve gathered

41:21.269 --> 41:24.809
neatly corroborates
numerous legends and stories,

41:24.809 --> 41:27.900
suggesting that a vast treasure
was brought here

41:27.900 --> 41:30.509
and then buried centuries ago.

41:30.509 --> 41:35.559
A treasure that six men
have died trying to find,

41:35.559 --> 41:39.089
and armed with a curse,

41:39.089 --> 41:42.199
claiming that one more
will have to die

41:42.199 --> 41:46.339
before the mystery
can be solved.

41:46.339 --> 41:48.020
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:48.020 --> 41:49.059
Everything’s closing in.

41:49.059 --> 41:50.299
We’re running out of time.

41:50.299 --> 41:51.390
NARRATOR:
...it’s the exciting

41:51.390 --> 41:52.390
season finale.

41:52.390 --> 41:53.390
-No record of this.

41:53.390 --> 41:54.390
-No.

41:54.390 --> 41:55.390
-BILLY: Maybe there’s something

41:55.390 --> 41:56.390
-on the other side of this.

41:56.390 --> 41:57.390
-ALL: Whoa!

41:57.390 --> 41:58.390
CORT:
The Rochefoucaulds shared

41:58.390 --> 42:00.619
the truth of Oak Island
with the Founding Fathers.

42:00.619 --> 42:02.380
BRUCE:
They used the treasure to

42:02.380 --> 42:04.599
finance the Revolutionary War.

42:04.599 --> 42:05.599
-MARTY: Holy smokes.

42:05.599 --> 42:06.730
-RICK: What’s that symbol?

42:06.730 --> 42:08.431
BRUCE:
George Washington designed it.

42:08.431 --> 42:09.469
JUSTIN:
It matches perfectly.

42:09.469 --> 42:10.469
-GARY: Holy schmoly.

42:10.469 --> 42:11.579
-RICK: There’s a wall here.

42:11.579 --> 42:12.579
-Isn’t that something?

42:12.579 --> 42:13.579
-I mean, that’s evidence.
