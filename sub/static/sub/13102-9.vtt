00:01.667 --> 00:02.875
[instrumental music]

00:06.375 --> 00:09.208
(Sheridan)
Alright, what's wrong now?

00:09.292 --> 00:11.083
This is my analysis of
the latest batch of reports

00:11.167 --> 00:13.667
from the rangers, we've had
a major increase in attacks

00:13.750 --> 00:14.917
against the shipping lines

00:15.000 --> 00:16.917
of the alliance worlds
in recent weeks.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.708
[sighs]
Hit and run attacks,
very efficient.

00:19.792 --> 00:22.833
No survivors, no warning.

00:22.917 --> 00:25.042
So far, very typical raid..

00:26.333 --> 00:28.667
I do not think
these are raiders, John.

00:30.417 --> 00:33.417
The ships were destroyed
with the cargo still onboard?

00:33.500 --> 00:34.917
Raiders strike quickly.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.542
Knock out communications
and navigational control.

00:37.625 --> 00:39.917
Plunder the cargo bays
then destroy the ships.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.167
Whoever is behind these attacks

00:41.250 --> 00:43.417
isn't interested
in cargo or profit.

00:43.500 --> 00:44.792
Therefore, they are not raiders.

00:44.875 --> 00:46.417
John, these attacks
are being carried out

00:46.500 --> 00:48.458
with almost
military-like precision.

00:48.542 --> 00:50.708
Textbook search
and destroy missions.

00:50.792 --> 00:53.792
Do the rangers have any idea
who's responsible for this?

00:53.875 --> 00:57.708
Nope. No survivors,
no witnesses and no evidence.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.417
The transports were so
completely overwhelmed

00:59.500 --> 01:01.583
they didn't even have
a chance to fight back.

01:01.667 --> 01:03.458
And until now the other worlds
probably figured

01:03.542 --> 01:05.125
this is just a local problem.

01:05.208 --> 01:07.417
When they find out
it's this widespread..

01:09.625 --> 01:11.625
When do the others
get this report?

01:11.708 --> 01:13.708
We are required to give
the council a briefing

01:13.792 --> 01:15.875
on matters affecting
their planetary security

01:15.958 --> 01:19.083
within 24 hours
of reviewing them in-house.

01:20.708 --> 01:25.125
Every member race
...has been hit equally.

01:25.208 --> 01:27.250
And the attacks have been
totally random.

01:27.333 --> 01:29.500
So that rules out
border skirmishes

01:29.583 --> 01:32.083
or political disagreements.

01:32.167 --> 01:34.125
There is no one obvious
to blame.

01:34.208 --> 01:36.833
Which means they'll blame
each other, randomly.

01:38.333 --> 01:40.583
Tell the rangers to deploy
along the main shipping lines.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.625
Monitor all frequencies
for distress signals.

01:43.708 --> 01:46.750
We have to find out
who is responsible for this

01:46.833 --> 01:49.000
or we're gonna have
a real problem on our hands.

01:49.083 --> 01:51.250
A highly trained
but unknown military force

01:51.333 --> 01:53.708
striking randomly
against our allies.

01:56.125 --> 01:58.250
I'd say we already have
a real problem.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.042
[explosion]

02:01.125 --> 02:03.625
[dramatic music]

02:10.583 --> 02:12.083
(Kosh)
And so it begins..

02:12.167 --> 02:14.167
- There is a hole in your mind.
- What do you want?

02:14.250 --> 02:17.042
(G'Kar)
No one here
is exactly what he appears.

02:17.125 --> 02:18.917
(Sinclair)
Nothing's the same anymore.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.708
(Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.792
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn...

02:22.875 --> 02:24.542
(Elric)
I see a great hand

02:24.625 --> 02:26.625
reaching out of the stars...

02:26.708 --> 02:28.000
(female #1)
President Clark has signed

02:28.083 --> 02:29.500
a decree today
declaring martial law.

02:29.583 --> 02:30.792
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us

02:30.875 --> 02:32.042
to declare independence.

02:32.125 --> 02:33.583
Unless your people get off

02:33.667 --> 02:34.958
their encounter suited butts
and do something.

02:35.042 --> 02:36.708
(Zathras)
You're the one who was.

02:36.792 --> 02:39.417
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'ha'dum
you will die.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.917
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.792
Do you have anything
worth living for?

02:42.875 --> 02:44.375
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful city
in flames.

02:44.458 --> 02:45.875
(Sheridan)
Giants in the playground.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.583
Now get the hell out
of our galaxy.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.292
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

02:50.375 --> 02:52.167
[theme music]

03:20.458 --> 03:22.250
[music continues]

03:38.917 --> 03:41.333
[dramatic music]

03:52.708 --> 03:54.792
[indistinct chatter]

04:06.042 --> 04:09.792
Ah, Prime Minister Mollari

04:09.875 --> 04:11.542
so good to have you back.

04:11.625 --> 04:14.500
I trust your journey
was a pleasant one.

04:14.583 --> 04:15.917
Not really. No.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.250
And I see you've brought

04:17.333 --> 04:19.667
your own entertainment
with you.

04:19.750 --> 04:22.042
An excellent idea.

04:22.125 --> 04:25.042
And quite brave of you
to let him so close

04:25.125 --> 04:27.583
without keeping him
in chains.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.042
Perhaps we should change that.

04:29.125 --> 04:31.750
Just a few chains to make
the others more comfortable

04:31.833 --> 04:34.083
before we put him in a cell.

04:34.167 --> 04:35.833
He is my bodyguard.

04:35.917 --> 04:37.292
Well, it's good to know that

04:37.375 --> 04:40.083
your Excellency's
sense of humor is still intact

04:40.167 --> 04:42.958
after such a long voyage.

04:43.042 --> 04:45.917
Well, now, perhaps if we could
show you to your room..

04:46.000 --> 04:48.833
Minister Vitari,
I wasn't joking.

04:48.917 --> 04:51.667
His name is G'Kar.

04:51.750 --> 04:55.792
And he, uh
...he is my bodyguard.

04:55.875 --> 04:57.708
And I can find
my room very well

04:57.792 --> 05:00.042
on my own, thank you.

05:02.625 --> 05:04.750
What time is dinner here?

05:06.792 --> 05:07.917
Sundown.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.667
Good, I'm starved.

05:10.750 --> 05:12.042
[gasps]

05:13.667 --> 05:15.500
[music continues]

05:18.792 --> 05:20.375
(Byron)
Is that the last of them?

05:20.458 --> 05:22.500
Good. Close it up.

05:24.917 --> 05:27.000
Yesterday, something happened

05:27.083 --> 05:29.708
that will change
the lives of everyone.

05:29.792 --> 05:32.125
Perhaps, even alter
the course of the future.

05:33.792 --> 05:37.167
Most of you know
Lyta Alexander.

05:37.250 --> 05:39.792
During the Shadow War,
she served the Vorlons.

05:39.875 --> 05:42.167
Acted as their go-between.

05:42.250 --> 05:45.167
They adjusted her abilities,
made her stronger.

05:45.250 --> 05:48.083
And revealed the truth
to her.

05:48.167 --> 05:51.417
And last night
...she revealed it to us.

05:53.167 --> 05:56.417
While some telepaths on
other worlds evolved naturally

05:56.500 --> 05:58.875
the majority were created
by the Vorlons

05:58.958 --> 06:01.833
through centuries
of genetic manipulation.

06:01.917 --> 06:04.292
They created us so we could
be used by the other worlds

06:04.375 --> 06:07.333
as weapons in their war
against the shadows.

06:07.417 --> 06:09.458
'That is all we are to them.'

06:09.542 --> 06:12.750
'Things to be used
and thrown away.'

06:12.833 --> 06:15.208
All that was bad enough.

06:15.292 --> 06:18.375
But to find that we would
telepaths.

06:18.458 --> 06:21.000
Would not be hunted down
and caged and controlled

06:21.083 --> 06:22.833
if the Vorlons had not
interfered with our

06:22.917 --> 06:26.625
genetic makeup,
made us into what we are..

06:26.708 --> 06:29.292
Byron, what is done is done.

06:29.375 --> 06:31.625
We can't change what we are.

06:31.708 --> 06:33.583
No, we can't.

06:33.667 --> 06:34.750
But if we are what we are

06:34.833 --> 06:36.458
because we were made this way

06:36.542 --> 06:37.625
then I have to look
at our makers and say

06:37.708 --> 06:38.917
"You are responsible."

06:39.000 --> 06:42.417
The Vorlons are gone,
the Vorlons, the Shadows

06:42.500 --> 06:45.125
they're all gone,
there's no one left.

06:45.208 --> 06:46.625
Yes..

06:46.708 --> 06:49.292
But their legacy remains.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.583
that legacy.

06:51.667 --> 06:54.250
A legacy created
with one purpose.

06:54.333 --> 06:58.375
To serve the other worlds
in a war that is now over.

06:58.458 --> 07:00.417
Which leaves us where?

07:00.500 --> 07:02.667
'Abandoned? Alone?'

07:04.292 --> 07:06.125
No.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.625
There is another way.

07:09.042 --> 07:10.458
But it is dangerous.

07:11.917 --> 07:13.250
[knock on door]

07:13.333 --> 07:14.958
Yes!

07:20.583 --> 07:22.958
Hello, prime minister.

07:23.042 --> 07:24.667
Hello, Jano.
Where have you been?

07:24.750 --> 07:26.417
I've been asking
for you all day.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.667
I was away. I only just now
learned of your return.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.542
I-I hope this isn't
a bad time.

07:30.625 --> 07:32.333
No, no, I was just having
a drink before bed.

07:32.417 --> 07:35.458
- Here, sit, my old friend.
- Thank you.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.667
It's good to see you again.

07:37.750 --> 07:40.167
- How are you?
- Well..

07:40.250 --> 07:44.083
Sheridan's new alliance
is keeping me very busy.

07:44.167 --> 07:47.750
I have come back just to see
how things are doing here.

07:47.833 --> 07:50.167
How is the regent?

07:50.250 --> 07:52.042
Uh, not well, they say.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.667
"They say?"

07:53.750 --> 07:55.417
Haven't you seen him?

07:55.500 --> 07:57.542
He remains in seclusion.

07:57.625 --> 07:59.875
Officially...
only his personal physician

07:59.958 --> 08:01.250
and a few trusted aides

08:01.333 --> 08:04.583
who's seen him for
...oh, almost two months.

08:04.667 --> 08:07.250
Mmm. And unofficially?

08:07.333 --> 08:08.792
Some of the staff have found him

08:08.875 --> 08:11.417
wandering the palace
late at night.

08:11.500 --> 08:16.792
They say he talks to himself.
Cries, wails, curses.

08:16.875 --> 08:19.167
And then falls silent
when somebody approaches.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.792
Sometimes he says he has
something important to tell 'em.

08:23.875 --> 08:27.417
And then a cloud seems to pass
over his face

08:27.500 --> 08:30.083
and he walks away.

08:30.167 --> 08:32.417
Once, before his aides could
bring him back to his room

08:32.500 --> 08:36.417
he told a guard to kill him
that he was not himself.

08:38.375 --> 08:41.167
Of course, he was
...quite drunk at the time.

08:42.375 --> 08:45.667
Was he?
I find that very strange.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.333
I have known the regent
since the first time

08:47.417 --> 08:50.333
I came to the royal court.
He doesn't drink.

08:50.417 --> 08:54.083
He, he cultivated sobriety
as his only vice.

08:54.167 --> 08:57.667
A break with conventional
accepted behavior.

08:57.750 --> 09:01.000
- Perhaps he's changed.
- Perhaps. Well..

09:02.500 --> 09:06.292
Things do seem quieter than
when Cartagia was in charge.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.458
Oh, quieter, yes, yes.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.250
But also stranger.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.958
I was updating
the status report on our fleet.

09:15.042 --> 09:17.208
It is standard protocol.

09:17.292 --> 09:20.125
When an aide to the regent
told me to stop.

09:20.208 --> 09:22.750
He said that information
was for the regent only.

09:22.833 --> 09:24.208
And other reports, too.

09:24.292 --> 09:26.500
Grain production,
food supplies, ore production

09:26.583 --> 09:30.667
have all, all been
reclassified as top secret.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.958
- Why?
- I don't know.

09:33.042 --> 09:35.167
Nobody does.

09:35.250 --> 09:37.208
It's a strange thing, Londo.

09:38.708 --> 09:42.833
It's a...a feeling more than
anything I can point to.

09:42.917 --> 09:46.250
As if a darkness
had fallen over the palace.

09:46.333 --> 09:49.292
I've never felt anything
quite like it before.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.500
But I'm glad
you're back, Londo.

09:53.583 --> 09:56.667
If anybody can find out
what is going on, it's you.

09:56.750 --> 09:59.958
And, while the regent
can refuse to see me

10:00.042 --> 10:04.125
it would be very hard to avoid
seeing his own prime minister.

10:05.333 --> 10:07.917
Alright, Jano.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.333
Keep an eye out for anything
else you might consider strange.

10:11.417 --> 10:12.667
Let me know
what you find out.

10:12.750 --> 10:14.875
And I will bring it
to the regent myself.

10:14.958 --> 10:16.292
Thank you.

10:16.375 --> 10:20.167
Perhaps it's nothing,
just whispers and rumors.

10:20.250 --> 10:22.583
But just once I would like
to find myself wrong

10:22.667 --> 10:26.708
about these things
...for a change.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.917
- Goodnight, Londo.
- Goodnight, Jano.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.750
- See you in the morning.
- Oh, yes.

10:31.833 --> 10:34.167
[instrumental music]

10:41.208 --> 10:43.375
Lights.

10:43.458 --> 10:44.833
Lights!

10:47.458 --> 10:49.208
[intense music]

10:53.958 --> 10:55.917
Who's there?

10:59.917 --> 11:03.042
Regent...is that you?

11:03.125 --> 11:06.042
Yes. Yes.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.667
So they tell me.

11:09.333 --> 11:12.208
Now, what are you
doing here?

11:12.292 --> 11:15.417
Why, I came to see you,
Lord Jano.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.458
[chuckles]

11:17.542 --> 11:18.958
Why else?

11:20.500 --> 11:23.250
Certainly not the decor.

11:23.333 --> 11:25.750
Once I would have thought..

11:25.833 --> 11:28.750
...pastels for the curtains.

11:30.583 --> 11:34.417
But I think
we're well beyond pastels now.

11:35.833 --> 11:40.000
Um.. no bright colors anymore.

11:42.917 --> 11:45.000
Just darkness.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.708
[chuckling]
I remember..

11:53.375 --> 11:56.208
...when you were just a child

11:56.292 --> 11:59.125
Emperor Turhan
once picked you up

11:59.208 --> 12:02.792
and carried you
all around the palace.

12:02.875 --> 12:05.292
[chuckling]

12:05.375 --> 12:06.708
Do-do you remember?

12:06.792 --> 12:09.208
Yes, regent, I remember.

12:10.375 --> 12:12.625
But you shouldn't be here.

12:12.708 --> 12:14.875
It's late.
You should be asleep.

12:16.375 --> 12:18.375
Yes.

12:18.458 --> 12:20.708
I suppose I should.

12:22.625 --> 12:24.917
But I wanted to see you.

12:26.375 --> 12:28.625
I so wanted to see you again.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.708
You do understand, Jano

12:33.792 --> 12:36.792
that if it were my decision..

12:36.875 --> 12:40.333
...I would never let
anyone harm you.

12:40.417 --> 12:43.625
'I would never
let anyone hurt you..'

12:43.708 --> 12:45.833
...if it were my decision.

12:48.750 --> 12:51.417
But it's not my decision,
you see.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.000
[screams]

12:57.500 --> 12:59.875
Not my decision at all.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.458
[intense music]

13:08.083 --> 13:09.542
(Sheridan)
Then it's decided.

13:09.625 --> 13:12.708
The Yolu government will not
oppose the independence

13:12.792 --> 13:14.750
of the colonies in sector 800

13:14.833 --> 13:17.250
in exchange for an agreement
by the alliance

13:17.333 --> 13:19.625
to intercede
in all border disputes there

13:19.708 --> 13:22.500
for the next 20 years.

13:22.583 --> 13:24.250
Are there any challenges?

13:26.125 --> 13:29.500
Good. Then the motion is passed.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.542
I think that concludes
all our business today.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.250
Thank you for coming.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.250
Oh, and we have
an updated report

13:35.333 --> 13:37.000
on the security
of your shipping lines.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.417
It'll be uplinked
to your systems tonight.

13:41.208 --> 13:43.042
[indistinct chattering]

13:44.958 --> 13:47.292
And now the screaming begins.

13:49.125 --> 13:51.833
[indistinct chatter]

13:51.917 --> 13:53.750
Good evening.

13:59.833 --> 14:01.417
[beeping]

14:09.750 --> 14:12.167
[intense music]

14:28.042 --> 14:32.083
It's started.
There's no turning back now.

14:32.167 --> 14:34.250
I'll need you to stay here
and coordinate things

14:34.333 --> 14:36.208
while I go find
Mr. Garibaldi.

14:37.792 --> 14:39.583
In the next 24 hours,
I'll need you more

14:39.667 --> 14:41.458
than I've ever needed anyone.

14:41.542 --> 14:46.375
Your strength,
your wisdom...your warmth.

14:49.500 --> 14:52.000
(Lyta)
Byron...aren't you ever
afraid?

14:52.083 --> 14:54.458
(Byron)
Constantly, Lyta.

14:54.542 --> 14:56.042
Constantly.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.750
[dramatic music]

15:06.042 --> 15:08.625
[indistinct chatter]

15:10.542 --> 15:12.875
Oh, Prime Minister Mollari.
Good.

15:12.958 --> 15:14.333
I'm so glad you've come.

15:14.417 --> 15:15.583
I was telling the others

15:15.667 --> 15:18.583
about your exquisitely
ironic choice

15:18.667 --> 15:21.125
of a Narn for a bodyguard

15:21.208 --> 15:23.708
But anyone who wasn't there
refused to believe me.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.708
I could hardly
believe it myself.

15:25.792 --> 15:29.542
- But now that you're here--
here.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.333
And I would like
to see the regent.

15:31.417 --> 15:33.667
I'm afraid that's not possible,
prime minister.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.125
The regent is not well.

15:35.208 --> 15:38.125
But he did ask me to convey
his best wishes

15:38.208 --> 15:41.250
to you and your...whatever.

15:41.333 --> 15:44.958
And to say that he will join us
when his strength permits.

15:45.042 --> 15:46.708
I see.

15:46.792 --> 15:48.500
And where is Lord Jano?

15:48.583 --> 15:49.833
He said
he would meet me here.

15:49.917 --> 15:51.542
I'm sorry, prime minister.

15:51.625 --> 15:55.000
It is all I can do to keep
my own itinerary straight

15:55.083 --> 15:57.875
let alone
that of Lord Jano's.

15:57.958 --> 16:01.917
But I will inquire
if that is what you want.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.083
Yes, please.

16:09.833 --> 16:11.167
[chuckling]

16:12.583 --> 16:14.917
[gasps]

16:15.000 --> 16:18.417
Mollari, this business
has gone far enough.

16:18.500 --> 16:21.542
The palace guard should be
protection enough for anyone.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.542
To bring one of those in here

16:23.625 --> 16:25.208
is a slap in the face
to every Centauri

16:25.292 --> 16:27.500
who's given his life
guarding the palace.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.750
And it recklessly
endangers everyone here.

16:29.833 --> 16:32.375
Endangers? How?

16:32.458 --> 16:35.583
Narns are barbarians,
primitives.

16:35.667 --> 16:36.708
Turn your back on them
for a second

16:36.792 --> 16:38.042
they'll stick a knife in it.

16:38.125 --> 16:40.667
A Narn would never stab
a Centauri in the back.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.583
It has always been our tradition
to go for the chest.

16:43.667 --> 16:46.250
That way you can see the life go
out of their eyes as they fall.

16:46.333 --> 16:47.625
G'Kar.

16:47.708 --> 16:51.250
Just doing my best
in the interests of accuracy.

16:52.875 --> 16:55.000
So you were in error,
it happens.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.500
Be assured
that I do not carry a grudge.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.583
No?

16:59.667 --> 17:01.292
Interesting.

17:02.792 --> 17:04.542
I brought someone
with me.

17:06.375 --> 17:10.042
- 'Do you recognize him?'
- Yes.

17:10.125 --> 17:13.583
This is the Centauri that
whipped me, before Cartagia.

17:13.667 --> 17:15.417
And do you recognize
what he's holding?

17:15.500 --> 17:18.083
Yes. That is the whip
he used.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.167
I put his fate in your hands.

17:24.250 --> 17:26.292
In front of all these witnesses
I say

17:26.375 --> 17:28.625
that you will not be
prosecuted or charged

17:28.708 --> 17:31.125
for anything you might do.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.458
Go on.

17:34.708 --> 17:36.208
[gasps]

17:37.375 --> 17:39.333
[intense music]

17:57.208 --> 18:00.917
Tell me, minister
if I were to strike you

18:01.000 --> 18:02.458
which would you
be angry at?

18:02.542 --> 18:03.875
The hand that struck you

18:03.958 --> 18:06.458
or the heart that commanded
the hand to strike?

18:08.042 --> 18:10.292
Well, the heart, of course.

18:10.375 --> 18:12.958
The hand has no choice
but to do as it is told.

18:13.042 --> 18:15.250
It is the heart
that carries the burden

18:15.333 --> 18:18.417
and that heart is dead
in both of us, minister.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.625
It died with Cartagia.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.708
And it died in me
soon after.

18:23.792 --> 18:25.792
[clatters]

18:25.875 --> 18:29.542
Besides...everyone knows
that the true source of pain

18:29.625 --> 18:31.875
is neither the hand
nor the heart.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
It is the mouth.

18:35.083 --> 18:36.500
Is it not, minister?

18:36.583 --> 18:40.000
Mollari. I think that
you should follow me at once.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.167
[dramatic music]

18:48.292 --> 18:50.042
I just came in
to look for him

18:50.125 --> 18:53.167
And I found Lord Jano...
like that.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.750
I shall summon
the palace guard.

18:58.958 --> 19:01.292
This is a terrible day, Mollari.

19:05.208 --> 19:07.333
I looked in his eyes
when I searched him.

19:07.417 --> 19:09.750
This was not a man
who would seek death.

19:09.833 --> 19:13.833
Yes. Jano would never
kill himself. Never.

19:14.958 --> 19:16.708
He was murdered.

19:16.792 --> 19:19.083
[music continues]

19:23.208 --> 19:25.042
(Byron)
'And I appreciate
your taking the time'

19:25.125 --> 19:26.750
to see me, Mr. Garibaldi.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.917
Not a problem.
What can I do for you?

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
I'd like permission to address
the council for the alliance.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.792
- About what?
- I'd rather not say.

19:34.875 --> 19:37.917
- Then the answer is no.
- It's rather important.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.500
Well, then you're gonna
have to tell me what it is.

19:40.583 --> 19:42.250
Look, you've got
Sheridan, Delenn.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.583
All the ambassadors
from all the member worlds.

19:44.667 --> 19:47.000
That's a lot of people
and they're very busy.

19:47.083 --> 19:48.958
And if they're gonna give you
five minutes of their time

19:49.042 --> 19:50.708
they're gonna need to know why

19:50.792 --> 19:53.083
so if you can't tell me..

19:53.167 --> 19:55.042
...there's nothing I can do.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.208
You've had a number
of recent attacks

20:06.292 --> 20:08.083
against alliance shipping lines.

20:08.167 --> 20:11.417
By now the other races
know all about it.

20:11.500 --> 20:12.917
Yeah.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.958
Yeah. They're pretty
upset about it.

20:16.042 --> 20:19.042
Exactly. My information
could calm them down.

20:19.125 --> 20:21.750
But...if I give it to
any one person first

20:21.833 --> 20:23.292
they'll think it's a trick.

20:23.375 --> 20:25.542
It has to be done
in front of all of them.

20:30.042 --> 20:32.583
[instrumental music]

20:35.875 --> 20:37.417
And I wanna thank the Brakiri

20:37.500 --> 20:39.583
for their help
in rescuing survivors

20:39.667 --> 20:41.958
from a burning
Drazi transport.

20:42.042 --> 20:44.125
It is exactly that kind
of cooperation

20:44.208 --> 20:46.208
that the alliance stands for.

20:46.292 --> 20:48.083
[all applauding]

20:51.417 --> 20:53.792
Alright, if there is
no other business..

20:55.250 --> 20:58.667
...we have someone who wants
to address the council.

20:58.750 --> 21:01.000
Byron?

21:01.083 --> 21:03.250
I'm afraid
I'm going to divert

21:03.333 --> 21:06.083
from my prepared comments.

21:06.167 --> 21:07.833
But the matter at hand
is no less important

21:07.917 --> 21:10.167
than the one
I was expected to address.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.458
The reports
Lyta is handing out

21:13.542 --> 21:15.208
contain detailed information

21:15.292 --> 21:17.167
on how the Vorlons
created telepaths

21:17.250 --> 21:18.750
on a hundred different worlds

21:18.833 --> 21:21.958
through centuries of
genetic manipulation.

21:22.042 --> 21:25.042
'Human telepaths were among
those created by the Vorlons.'

21:25.125 --> 21:29.833
To serve their needs
and yours during the Shadow War.

21:29.917 --> 21:33.792
Now the war is over.
And we are abandoned.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.833
We belong to no one.

21:35.917 --> 21:37.917
We are being caged, pursued

21:38.000 --> 21:40.292
and forced into a kind
of slave labor.

21:40.375 --> 21:42.542
All for your benefit.

21:42.625 --> 21:46.875
So now I turn back to you
and say you must help us.

21:46.958 --> 21:48.917
The alliance
we were created to serve

21:49.000 --> 21:50.792
must now help its creations

21:50.875 --> 21:53.542
by giving us and all telepaths
a homeworld of our own.

21:53.625 --> 21:57.375
Byron, you are out of order.
Now, what you are asking for--

21:57.458 --> 22:01.042
Is small, compared to
the sacrifices we have made.

22:01.125 --> 22:02.917
There are many
habitable worlds

22:03.000 --> 22:04.375
on the edge
of your territories

22:04.458 --> 22:05.792
which have
no real value to you--

22:05.875 --> 22:07.708
I'm sorry.
There is nothing we can do.

22:07.792 --> 22:10.500
- What you are asking for--
- Will be given!

22:12.125 --> 22:14.750
For a very long time now,
we've hidden what we can do

22:14.833 --> 22:18.250
all for your sake.
That will now change.

22:18.333 --> 22:20.417
'We do not believe
in violence.'

22:20.500 --> 22:21.750
That is not our way.

22:21.833 --> 22:24.625
Our way is information.

22:24.708 --> 22:26.125
Over the last two days

22:26.208 --> 22:28.708
each of you has been followed
by one of my people.

22:28.792 --> 22:31.542
They have scanned every thought,
every secret..

22:31.625 --> 22:34.542
...every hidden thing
you would not want known.

22:34.625 --> 22:36.375
We now have all your secrets.

22:36.458 --> 22:38.333
[indistinct chattering]

22:39.917 --> 22:41.750
Give us a homeworld of our own

22:41.833 --> 22:44.000
and you will never hear
from us again.

22:44.083 --> 22:45.250
Fail to do so

22:45.333 --> 22:47.708
and all your secrets
will be revealed.

22:47.792 --> 22:50.000
[intense music]

22:57.292 --> 22:59.208
Never, ever, ever
trust a telepath.

22:59.292 --> 23:01.500
I swear to you that
I'm gonna have that tattooed

23:01.583 --> 23:03.292
on the inside of my eyelids.

23:03.375 --> 23:06.625
- Damn it, I'm sorry--
- It wasn't your fault.

23:06.708 --> 23:08.333
Byron's telepaths
have provided us

23:08.417 --> 23:10.292
with solid information
ever since you brought them

23:10.375 --> 23:12.458
into the covert
intelligence division.

23:12.542 --> 23:14.000
You couldn't have known
they were gonna pull this.

23:14.083 --> 23:16.042
I should've known.

23:16.125 --> 23:17.625
Don't they understand
what they're doing here?

23:17.708 --> 23:20.417
They might as well
just have rolled in a grenade.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.917
Look, they were very smart

23:22.000 --> 23:24.750
in not saying
exactly what they knew.

23:24.833 --> 23:26.417
Now, unless they do
a deep scan

23:26.500 --> 23:27.625
a telepath can only pick up

23:27.708 --> 23:29.083
what you're thinking
at the moment.

23:29.167 --> 23:30.458
But who the hell remembers

23:30.542 --> 23:33.292
every passing thought
they had for two days?

23:33.375 --> 23:34.792
Leaving everyone
to assume they know

23:34.875 --> 23:36.917
the most damaging
information possible.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.042
Which begs the question.

23:41.208 --> 23:44.000
What are we
going to do about it?

23:44.083 --> 23:45.708
Perhaps they are right.

23:47.083 --> 23:49.333
It is true that the Vorlons
guided their evolution

23:49.417 --> 23:51.500
creating telepaths
for their own purposes

23:51.583 --> 23:53.833
to serve our needs
in the war.

23:53.917 --> 23:56.333
Perhaps we do have
an obligation to them.

23:56.417 --> 23:58.417
Fine. I'll set them up
a trust fund.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.625
But a homeworld of
their own? Come on!

24:00.708 --> 24:02.458
If you were hated
by your own race

24:02.542 --> 24:04.417
forced to join the Psi corps

24:04.500 --> 24:07.000
or forced to take drugs
to inhibit your talents

24:07.083 --> 24:08.458
for the rest of your life.

24:08.542 --> 24:10.250
If you had been hunted

24:10.333 --> 24:12.333
and enslaved by the others.

24:12.417 --> 24:14.333
Would you not want
a place of your own?

24:14.417 --> 24:16.292
A place where others like you
could gather safely

24:16.375 --> 24:18.000
without fear of persecution?

24:18.083 --> 24:19.333
Okay, I grant you.

24:19.417 --> 24:23.042
On a strictly idealistic level,
it's understandable.

24:23.125 --> 24:25.750
But they did it the wrong way,
the inconvenient way.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.375
I seem to recall
the Earth President

24:29.458 --> 24:31.333
saying the same thing to you

24:31.417 --> 24:33.875
after your Civil War.

24:33.958 --> 24:36.500
[instrumental music]

24:39.542 --> 24:41.375
I hate it that
she has a memory. Don't you?

24:41.458 --> 24:43.458
Damned inconvenient.

24:45.667 --> 24:48.667
Well...at least it's still
a political problem.

24:48.750 --> 24:51.292
So far it hasn't
turned violent.

24:55.792 --> 24:57.208
Yet.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.667
Is there ever a time when
you are not eating, G'Kar?

25:02.750 --> 25:05.292
As bodyguard, I must
keep up my strength.

25:05.375 --> 25:08.042
I could be called upon
to give my life to save yours

25:08.125 --> 25:09.417
at a moment's notice.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.917
It's bad luck to die
on an empty stomach.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.083
We believe that..

25:13.167 --> 25:14.542
[knock on door]

25:18.333 --> 25:20.458
Yes?

25:20.542 --> 25:23.292
Prime minister, the regent
will see you now.

25:23.375 --> 25:26.083
I believe you know the way
to his private bedchamber.

25:26.167 --> 25:27.667
Yes.

25:30.792 --> 25:32.042
[grunts]

25:34.000 --> 25:35.792
[intense music]

25:54.958 --> 25:56.333
- 'G'Kar?'
- 'Yes?'

25:56.417 --> 25:57.833
I'm glad you had
something to eat.

25:57.917 --> 26:00.542
- So am I.
- When I move, run.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.500
[grunting]

26:03.958 --> 26:05.125
Run!

26:05.208 --> 26:06.625
G'Kar!

26:06.708 --> 26:08.000
G'Kar!

26:08.083 --> 26:10.167
[music continues]

26:20.625 --> 26:23.125
(Vole)
Mollari.

26:23.208 --> 26:26.667
You should never have
come back to Centauri Prime.

26:26.750 --> 26:29.542
You are an obstacle
to my ambitions.

26:29.625 --> 26:32.875
With one move, I remove you.

26:32.958 --> 26:34.458
[gasps]

26:36.750 --> 26:38.667
[groans]

26:42.417 --> 26:44.458
[music continues]

26:48.083 --> 26:49.833
[grunting]

26:58.500 --> 27:00.542
[groaning]

27:02.792 --> 27:04.500
Are you alright?

27:04.583 --> 27:06.333
- Yes, I think so.
- Good.

27:06.417 --> 27:09.292
I suggest we leave
the area before others come.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.292
I gave very explicit orders

27:17.375 --> 27:18.833
that no one was
to leave the area

27:18.917 --> 27:20.417
until we heard back
from the council.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.833
We needed supplies.

27:21.917 --> 27:23.125
He said he'd come
right back.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.667
Don't you understand?

27:24.750 --> 27:26.500
They're afraid of us
right now.

27:26.583 --> 27:29.042
We have to stay here
quietly, peacefully.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.917
They have to see we're not
acting against them.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.208
And if they come after us
we'll need

27:32.292 --> 27:33.292
all the supplies we can get.

27:33.375 --> 27:34.708
(Byron)
'They won't.'

27:34.792 --> 27:37.292
If we stay together
and do nothing to break the laws

27:37.375 --> 27:39.292
security will have
to protect us.

27:39.375 --> 27:41.708
If we split up,
anything can happen.

27:41.792 --> 27:44.000
- Then we'll go after them.
- 'No.'

27:44.083 --> 27:46.333
(Byron)
'That would only further
complicate the situation.'

27:46.417 --> 27:47.500
'We can only hope that..'

27:47.583 --> 27:49.500
[grunting]

27:51.542 --> 27:54.042
(male #1)
One of your kind violated
our ambassador.

27:54.125 --> 27:55.583
Which was it?

27:55.667 --> 27:57.417
[intense music]

27:57.500 --> 27:59.750
[grunting]

27:59.833 --> 28:01.542
- We have to help him.
- No. Stay here.

28:01.625 --> 28:04.375
We cannot return violence
with violence. We have to wait.

28:04.458 --> 28:05.625
I can't.

28:05.708 --> 28:07.250
You said we had to look out
for each other

28:07.333 --> 28:08.667
protect each other.

28:08.750 --> 28:10.208
We have to stop them.

28:10.292 --> 28:12.833
[dramatic music]

28:16.750 --> 28:18.792
[groaning]

28:29.833 --> 28:31.667
[grunting]

28:49.875 --> 28:51.667
[music continues]

29:07.750 --> 29:10.042
[instrumental music]

29:34.625 --> 29:37.083
- Mr. President.
- Zack.

29:37.167 --> 29:39.500
I assume you heard.

29:39.583 --> 29:42.958
We just finished
...debating the problem.

29:44.333 --> 29:46.417
You know, I-I always wondered
what it would take

29:46.500 --> 29:50.000
to make all of these ambassadors
act together.

29:50.083 --> 29:51.625
Now I know.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.333
It's the worst thing
you can do to someone, Zack.

29:56.417 --> 29:58.708
Threaten to reveal
his secrets.

29:58.792 --> 30:01.083
And on top of that,
now the Drazi are claiming

30:01.167 --> 30:03.583
that their people
were attacked by telepaths.

30:03.667 --> 30:05.542
That threats were made.

30:05.625 --> 30:08.375
[scoffs]
And with everyone
already wired up

30:08.458 --> 30:10.250
over the attacks
on their shipping lines

30:10.333 --> 30:13.667
it was the proverbial straw
that broke the camel's back.

30:16.125 --> 30:18.458
[sighs]

30:18.542 --> 30:21.375
I assume Captain Lochley
sent you.

30:21.458 --> 30:23.375
- Yes, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

30:23.458 --> 30:26.667
And I assume she reminded you
to remind me

30:26.750 --> 30:29.458
that she thought this idea
of a colony of telepaths

30:29.542 --> 30:31.708
was a bad idea
right from the start.

30:31.792 --> 30:33.875
Yes, sir.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.417
Yeah.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.792
Well, maybe, she was right.

30:41.583 --> 30:43.958
She wants me
...to pull them in.

30:44.042 --> 30:46.083
But they came here
under your protection.

30:46.167 --> 30:47.917
She won't contravene that.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.375
She needs your authorization

30:49.458 --> 30:50.917
before she can
take them out.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.250
How many people are
we talking about here?

30:53.333 --> 30:55.125
Well, it's hard to say.

30:55.208 --> 30:56.667
They don't have to register
as telepaths

30:56.750 --> 30:58.792
when they come in,
they keep to themselves.

30:58.875 --> 31:02.083
Reports are about 50
to 150 people living down there.

31:06.125 --> 31:08.833
Ah, maybe, Delenn was right.

31:08.917 --> 31:11.500
Maybe, we do owe them a lot more
than we've given them.

31:13.458 --> 31:14.583
But there's nothing
we can do about it

31:14.667 --> 31:16.250
until we have them
in custody.

31:16.333 --> 31:18.917
Then, maybe,
we can calm things down.

31:21.542 --> 31:24.375
As of now, I am withdrawing
my protection.

31:24.458 --> 31:27.000
You are authorized to move
as soon as you are ready.

31:29.250 --> 31:30.917
Do what you have to do, Zack.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.792
[intense music]

31:35.542 --> 31:38.917
(Byron)
They'll be coming for us soon.
We need to prepare.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.250
Move all our food stores
in here, get everyone together.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.708
(Lyta)
Byron, I can try
talking to Sheridan.

31:44.792 --> 31:47.583
- He'd listen to me.
- I'm sure he would.

31:47.667 --> 31:49.125
But, the situation
is almost certainly

31:49.208 --> 31:50.875
beyond his control.

31:50.958 --> 31:53.167
The other ambassadors
will insist on our arrest.

31:53.250 --> 31:54.542
Then what do we do?

31:54.625 --> 31:57.083
Go along like sheep
when they come for us?

31:57.167 --> 32:00.458
No. We will refuse
to be arrested.

32:00.542 --> 32:02.458
But we will do so peacefully.

32:03.958 --> 32:06.375
We'll weld shut
all the air doors.

32:06.458 --> 32:07.708
Block all the transport tubes.

32:07.792 --> 32:10.167
They'll have to dig us out
inch by inch.

32:10.250 --> 32:12.542
What do we do when the food
runs out?

32:12.625 --> 32:15.000
Then we will have
nothing to eat.

32:15.083 --> 32:17.250
And when the other worlds
hear of our starving in here

32:17.333 --> 32:19.167
for the dream
of our own homeworld

32:19.250 --> 32:21.958
it may soften their hearts
towards us.

32:22.042 --> 32:23.542
The longer it takes them
to get to us

32:23.625 --> 32:26.250
the more we may have
a chance to negotiate.

32:26.333 --> 32:28.417
In time, cooler heads
may prevail.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.083
No!

32:31.750 --> 32:34.333
When I was first identified
as a telepath

32:34.417 --> 32:35.667
my family said to wait.

32:35.750 --> 32:36.875
Perhaps they won't
come for us.

32:36.958 --> 32:39.625
Perhaps we can
work this out in peace.

32:41.042 --> 32:44.625
But they came for me
...and my sister.

32:44.708 --> 32:47.708
And now they will come
for all of us.

32:47.792 --> 32:49.042
'We've spent years
on the run'

32:49.125 --> 32:50.875
'and in those years,
we've been free'

32:50.958 --> 32:53.000
'from the Psi corps,
free from the hatred'

32:53.083 --> 32:55.125
'and the oppression
and the fear.'

32:56.292 --> 32:58.875
How many of you
want to go back to that?

33:00.500 --> 33:02.208
Because that is exactly
what will happen

33:02.292 --> 33:04.333
if we sit here and wait.

33:04.417 --> 33:06.833
Then what do you propose?

33:06.917 --> 33:09.875
You had the right idea, Byron.
You just didn't go far enough.

33:09.958 --> 33:11.917
We have their secrets.
We can fight back.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.167
I say we leave here
while we can

33:14.250 --> 33:15.667
split up and strike back.

33:15.750 --> 33:17.542
Make them understand

33:17.625 --> 33:18.917
that if they give us
what we want

33:19.000 --> 33:20.542
we'll go in peace.

33:20.625 --> 33:23.250
But if they don't,
we fight.

33:23.333 --> 33:24.917
- You'll fight?
- Yes.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.083
- And kill.
- If necessary.

33:30.708 --> 33:33.250
[intense music]

33:38.208 --> 33:42.667
We took these from the Drazi.
We can get more.

33:42.750 --> 33:46.250
Have you learned
...so little?

33:46.333 --> 33:48.708
Is there not one of you
who understands?

33:53.083 --> 33:54.708
[clanks]

33:58.000 --> 34:00.083
I am staying here.

34:00.167 --> 34:03.333
Whoever wishes to go,
can go.

34:03.417 --> 34:05.542
I have no hold over you.

34:08.583 --> 34:11.458
- Byron.
- Go...while you still can.

34:11.542 --> 34:14.125
[music continues]

34:36.208 --> 34:39.125
And I can't tell you
how glad we are

34:39.208 --> 34:41.708
that you escaped harm,
prime minister.

34:42.917 --> 34:45.583
How did you manage
to escape?

34:45.667 --> 34:48.542
Oh, I live a charmed life.
Clean living.

34:48.625 --> 34:53.125
Ah. Well...Vole was always
trouble, you know.

34:53.208 --> 34:54.917
Yes, even the regent
has had difficulty

34:55.000 --> 34:56.958
containing his ambitions.

34:57.042 --> 34:59.667
Well, it won't be
a problem anymore.

34:59.750 --> 35:01.958
He has overreached himself.

35:02.042 --> 35:04.167
- The regent--
- And where is the regent, hmm?

35:04.250 --> 35:05.750
Pardon?

35:05.833 --> 35:08.458
Earlier, you said the regent
was ready to see me.

35:08.542 --> 35:10.833
Was he...or wasn't he?

35:11.917 --> 35:13.417
Or were you merely
setting me up

35:13.500 --> 35:15.208
for Vole's attempt
on my life, hmm?

35:16.583 --> 35:19.333
[laughing]

35:19.417 --> 35:22.167
Oh, you almost had me going
there, prime minister.

35:22.250 --> 35:27.542
Where...is...the...regent?

35:27.625 --> 35:31.375
Uh...uh...well, I don't
actually know, you-you see.

35:31.458 --> 35:34.083
Uh...he was there
when I sent for you.

35:34.167 --> 35:37.000
But then when I came back,
he was gone.

35:37.083 --> 35:40.375
But I assure you that every
possible attempt will be made

35:40.458 --> 35:43.208
to locate him
just as soon as possible.

35:43.292 --> 35:45.667
Yes, yes, please, please.
Thank you. Thank you.

35:45.750 --> 35:47.250
Yes.

36:03.958 --> 36:05.708
Are you sure?

36:12.500 --> 36:14.583
[giggling]

36:17.375 --> 36:18.708
Regent.

36:20.542 --> 36:22.292
Regent Virini.

36:23.875 --> 36:27.042
Yeah. Hello, Mollari.

36:27.125 --> 36:29.250
Beautiful night, isn't it?

36:29.333 --> 36:32.833
As nights go.
And they go so quickly now.

36:32.917 --> 36:35.250
Are you alright?

36:35.333 --> 36:38.375
Yes. Yes.

36:38.458 --> 36:39.875
No.

36:39.958 --> 36:44.500
I-I-I'm glad we got there
in time to save you, Mollari.

36:44.583 --> 36:47.708
You know
...you were the only one

36:47.792 --> 36:51.833
who treated me fairly
when Cartagia was here.

36:53.250 --> 36:56.333
But he's still here,
isn't he?

36:58.875 --> 37:00.833
His legacy.

37:00.917 --> 37:03.292
Then it was you
who saved me?

37:03.375 --> 37:05.292
No.

37:06.708 --> 37:08.708
Not exactly.

37:08.792 --> 37:10.792
It was them.

37:10.875 --> 37:13.292
They like you, you know.

37:13.375 --> 37:14.625
That's why they saved you.

37:14.708 --> 37:17.250
They say you are
just like them. They say..

37:20.208 --> 37:23.208
They say you have
much in common.

37:23.292 --> 37:26.000
- They? Who are they?
- Shh.

37:27.667 --> 37:31.458
Quietly, Londo,
...quietly.

37:34.625 --> 37:36.625
You will follow me.

37:38.333 --> 37:40.417
You will be emperor soon.

37:41.708 --> 37:43.167
Yes.

37:43.250 --> 37:45.375
I'm sorry.

37:46.292 --> 37:51.042
I'm so...so sorry.

37:55.542 --> 37:58.708
They have a message
for you.

37:58.792 --> 38:01.375
They say, we know
you have been asking

38:01.458 --> 38:03.083
about our supplies and ships.

38:03.167 --> 38:05.250
They say..

38:05.333 --> 38:07.250
...let it go.

38:07.333 --> 38:09.375
[intense music]

38:11.250 --> 38:14.750
You will understand
it all soon enough.

38:14.833 --> 38:16.583
No, I want to
understand it now.

38:16.667 --> 38:20.708
No! No, you don't.

38:20.792 --> 38:25.792
If you have ever believed me
before, Londo, believe me now.

38:27.167 --> 38:32.292
You still have time.
Enjoy it.

38:32.375 --> 38:34.583
Run in-in the sunlight.

38:35.958 --> 38:38.292
Eat like..

38:41.833 --> 38:44.417
...like a fool.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.875
You have so little time.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.000
[music continues]

38:51.583 --> 38:53.208
You should go now.

38:53.292 --> 38:56.583
- Quickly.
- Regent..

38:56.667 --> 38:58.750
We will speak..

38:58.833 --> 39:00.917
...one more time
before the end.

39:02.667 --> 39:04.750
Go now.

39:04.833 --> 39:06.583
Go on.

39:06.667 --> 39:08.833
[music continues]

39:22.208 --> 39:24.292
Well, what did you learn?

39:25.708 --> 39:28.083
I don't know.

39:28.167 --> 39:29.792
Come along.

39:40.292 --> 39:42.333
[growls]

39:47.083 --> 39:50.875
[choking]
I-I didn't say anything.

39:50.958 --> 39:55.292
[choking]
I-I d-didn't say..

39:55.375 --> 39:57.667
I-I didn't, I didn't..

39:57.750 --> 39:59.750
[groans]

40:05.625 --> 40:07.958
[instrumental music]

40:35.833 --> 40:38.000
- G'Kar.
- Yes?

40:38.083 --> 40:40.333
Tomorrow morning we will arrange

40:40.417 --> 40:43.667
for the first transport
back to Babylon 5.

40:43.750 --> 40:46.208
I thought you were staying
for at least a month.

40:46.292 --> 40:48.125
Yes, so did I.

40:49.958 --> 40:52.292
[sighs]

40:52.375 --> 40:54.417
G'Kar..

40:54.500 --> 40:56.333
...I have been
in the royal palace on and off

40:56.417 --> 40:58.625
for most of my life.

40:58.708 --> 41:00.625
Even when Cartagia was here

41:00.708 --> 41:03.417
I never lost
my affection for it.

41:03.500 --> 41:05.750
But tonight
for the first time..

41:08.000 --> 41:10.875
...I think it frightens me.

41:10.958 --> 41:13.750
you?

41:13.833 --> 41:16.625
Well, I won't be getting
any sleep tonight.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.333
[sighs]

41:22.375 --> 41:26.000
What could they be doing
with our ships, I wonder?

41:34.375 --> 41:37.167
(male #2)
'We beg you, do not fire.
We're unarmed.'

41:37.250 --> 41:39.042
'We've, we've done nothing
to you.'

41:39.125 --> 41:40.833
'We've done nothing.'

41:40.917 --> 41:42.542
[explosion]

41:46.458 --> 41:48.750
(Zack on speaker)
'Is this thing on? It is?'

41:48.833 --> 41:51.208
[clears throat]

41:51.292 --> 41:53.458
'This is Babylon 5
station security'

41:53.542 --> 41:56.000
'to telepaths
in brown sector.'

41:56.083 --> 41:58.750
'We are aware that you have
sabotaged the transport tubes'

41:58.833 --> 42:01.333
'and welded
the access hatches shut.'

42:01.417 --> 42:03.667
'You are ordered
to remove these obstructions'

42:03.750 --> 42:06.000
'and surrender at once.'

42:06.083 --> 42:09.083
'Failure to do so will result
in direct confrontation'

42:09.167 --> 42:10.917
'with our forces
and I imagine'

42:11.000 --> 42:14.292
'you don't want that
any more than we do.'

42:14.375 --> 42:18.292
'Lyta, if you're in there
come on out now'

42:18.375 --> 42:21.208
'and we may be able
to intercede for you.'

42:21.292 --> 42:25.625
'Anyone else who wants
to come out...do so now.'

42:25.708 --> 42:29.250
'If you stay,
if any of you stay there'

42:29.333 --> 42:30.833
'and resist the order
of the president'

42:30.917 --> 42:34.458
'that you surrender yourselves
and this area'

42:34.542 --> 42:37.500
'we cannot be held responsible
for the consequences.'

42:39.708 --> 42:41.417
You could go, Lyta.

42:43.625 --> 42:45.333
I don't want to.

42:51.125 --> 42:53.542
We can hold them off
for a day.

42:53.625 --> 42:56.000
Two days, maybe three.
No more.

43:00.042 --> 43:01.333
There will come a moment

43:01.417 --> 43:03.583
when I will ask you
to leave me behind.

43:05.042 --> 43:08.833
When that moment comes
you must do exactly as I say.

43:08.917 --> 43:10.958
Promise me that, Lyta.

43:12.833 --> 43:14.917
Promise me.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.417
