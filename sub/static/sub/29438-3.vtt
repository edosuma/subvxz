00:00.976 --> 00:03.912
- Previously on The Resident...
- How did you get this place?

00:03.913 --> 00:07.037
Are you sure right now is the
right time to make this move?

00:07.038 --> 00:08.383
I've never been so sure.

00:08.384 --> 00:10.868
- Remind me why I hired you.
- Your last assistant quit,

00:10.869 --> 00:12.295
and my dad is Zip Betournay.

00:12.296 --> 00:14.038
He owns the Crystal Springs golf club.

00:14.039 --> 00:16.756
I can find you a
smoking hot date tonight.

00:16.757 --> 00:18.117
I-I have someone in mind.

00:18.118 --> 00:20.042
My ex-husband is so hard on Grayson,

00:20.043 --> 00:22.663
but I'm proud of him. He's a good son.

00:22.664 --> 00:25.475
I can't let Jessie go without
knowing what really happened.

00:25.476 --> 00:26.999
Please, just take a look at this.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.782
It's Jessie's medical records. I just,

00:28.783 --> 00:30.721
I just want to know that
nothing terrible happened,

00:30.722 --> 00:32.897
everything was done right.

00:34.509 --> 00:37.651
- It's a terrible idea.
- Oh, come on, just play along.

00:37.652 --> 00:39.285
We live under the same roof now.

00:39.286 --> 00:41.363
- Which is amazing.
- Agreed,

00:41.364 --> 00:43.135
but people get on each other's nerves,

00:43.136 --> 00:46.086
which is why I'm proposing that
we both get to pick one thing

00:46.087 --> 00:47.598
that drives the other one crazy.

00:47.599 --> 00:48.715
Only one?

00:48.716 --> 00:50.332
Cute. Yes.

00:50.333 --> 00:52.324
And we both try to quell the thing

00:52.325 --> 00:55.276
in an effort to live happily ever after.

00:55.277 --> 00:57.587
- Fine.
- Good. You go first.

01:00.436 --> 01:03.581
- Okay. Here we go.
- Okay.

01:03.582 --> 01:05.415
Go ahead.

01:07.753 --> 01:10.962
You do this-this thing when you eat.

01:12.407 --> 01:14.215
What?

01:15.410 --> 01:17.762
Mmm.

01:17.763 --> 01:19.955
Mmm...

01:19.956 --> 01:21.790
Mmm. Mmm!

01:21.791 --> 01:24.829
- And that annoys you?
- You have no idea.

01:24.830 --> 01:27.754
- I just like food.
- This is why I didn't want to do it.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.295
All right, fine, yeah. No, you're right.

01:29.296 --> 01:32.414
I can totally enjoy my food silently.

01:32.415 --> 01:33.716
My turn.

01:33.717 --> 01:35.193
- Uh-oh.
- "Uh-oh" is right.

01:36.150 --> 01:38.691
Receiving reports of a
high-speed police chase

01:38.692 --> 01:41.860
in Midtown Atlanta
involving two suspects

01:41.861 --> 01:43.195
believed to be armed.

01:43.196 --> 01:45.480
Drivers in the affected
area are being urged

01:45.481 --> 01:46.802
to stay off the roads.

01:46.803 --> 01:49.151
Pursuit is heading north on Peachtree.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.517
We have a problem.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.830
You hang on.

02:01.831 --> 02:04.640
Hey, you stay the hell awake.

02:04.641 --> 02:06.216
If you keep driving like this,

02:06.217 --> 02:08.334
you're gonna die with me, brother.

02:08.335 --> 02:10.619
Ain't nobody gonna die today.

02:10.620 --> 02:14.213
That's good. Don't want yours
to be the last face I see.

02:22.182 --> 02:23.683
Almost...

02:23.684 --> 02:25.977
Hey, you hang on.

02:25.978 --> 02:27.178
A few more seconds, okay?

02:29.924 --> 02:31.949
Listen up! We have a Code Silver.

02:31.950 --> 02:33.951
We need to lock the ER down now!

02:33.952 --> 02:36.171
Get everybody out of
here now. Let's go. Hurry.

02:36.172 --> 02:38.415
Ashley, come with me.

02:38.416 --> 02:40.491
The driver's armed.

02:40.492 --> 02:42.435
Okay, security, lock
these two doors down,

02:42.436 --> 02:45.228
- and nobody else in or out.
- Hey!

02:45.229 --> 02:48.054
Quickly and quietly come this way.

02:48.055 --> 02:49.530
- Let's go. This way,
- Come on, come on, come on...

02:49.531 --> 02:50.742
in an organized fashion.

02:50.743 --> 02:52.414
- Thank you very much.
- Come on, quickly.

02:52.415 --> 02:54.369
- Everybody, get back!
- Let's go.

02:54.370 --> 02:56.358
- I need help!
- Go, go.

02:58.677 --> 03:01.187
I'm a cop, he's not.

03:01.188 --> 03:03.196
I need him alive!

03:03.197 --> 03:05.764
Open up!

03:17.721 --> 03:19.504
Detective Al Raines,

03:19.505 --> 03:21.965
Atlanta PD. FYI, I'm fine.

03:21.966 --> 03:23.425
Yeah, with all that adrenaline going,

03:23.426 --> 03:25.702
Detective, you might
not feel your injuries.

03:25.703 --> 03:27.863
It's almost over, you son of a bitch.

03:27.864 --> 03:31.199
- I got your ass.
- Oh, you just stay tuned, Albie.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.967
- You stay tuned.
- You brought him here.

03:33.968 --> 03:36.261
He's in our hands now. You
need to trust us. All right?

03:36.262 --> 03:38.587
Let's go over here. You can
keep an eye on him from there.

03:38.588 --> 03:41.156
- All right?
- Yeah.

03:41.157 --> 03:42.565
I'll trust you.

03:42.566 --> 03:44.917
Just make sure your
doctors don't trust him.

03:44.918 --> 03:46.945
Can you bring me a lac tray? Thank you.

03:46.946 --> 03:48.328
Ain't no soul in that man.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.662
He runs a crew.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.879
They do high-end home invasions.

03:51.880 --> 03:54.831
Break in, tie up the family,
steal everything.

03:54.832 --> 03:56.565
Sometimes they let the people go.

03:56.566 --> 03:58.617
Other times, maybe the homeowner catches

03:58.618 --> 04:00.994
a glimpse of a face they shouldn't,

04:00.995 --> 04:02.244
they execute 'em.

04:02.932 --> 04:03.990
No mercy.

04:03.991 --> 04:05.807
All right, everyone be careful.

04:12.271 --> 04:13.815
Can you tell me your name?

04:14.580 --> 04:17.130
Hey, Albie? They want to know my name.

04:17.130 --> 04:18.581
Hey, you come on over here.

04:18.582 --> 04:20.286
I'll show you where to find your name.

04:20.286 --> 04:22.863
Airways intact. Decreased
breath sounds on the left.

04:22.864 --> 04:24.648
Got a tip earlier today.

04:24.649 --> 04:26.749
Caught Rob and his crew in the act.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.333
I cornered that bastard.

04:28.334 --> 04:30.243
Yeah, you sure did some damage.

04:30.244 --> 04:32.177
After he impaled himself,

04:32.178 --> 04:34.366
I thought he might die
right there on the spot.

04:34.367 --> 04:36.076
Got him here as fast as I could.

04:36.077 --> 04:38.978
The rest of Rob's crew got away.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.451
They took the homeowner with them.

04:40.452 --> 04:42.269
60-year-old grandfather.

04:42.270 --> 04:44.141
It's only a matter of
time before they realize

04:44.142 --> 04:46.217
they don't need that hostage anymore.

04:46.218 --> 04:48.747
Rob knows where his crew is hiding out.

04:48.748 --> 04:51.616
He's got to tell me where
they are soon, otherwise...

04:56.637 --> 04:57.818
Damn it.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.293
- Hey!
- Detective!

04:59.294 --> 05:00.698
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Give it back!

05:00.699 --> 05:02.048
- Back up!
- Hey!

05:02.049 --> 05:04.013
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:04.014 --> 05:05.822
- Give it up!
- Back up, man.

05:05.823 --> 05:07.463
- Let him go, let him go.
- I got it.

05:07.464 --> 05:09.820
We're good. Good.

05:09.821 --> 05:11.261
You enjoy that, Albie.

05:11.262 --> 05:13.337
It's the last thing you're
ever gonna get from me.

05:15.081 --> 05:16.989
Okay, let's get him to CT carefully

05:16.990 --> 05:19.291
and let's call the OR and
let them know we're coming.

05:19.292 --> 05:21.198
Chaz, hold down the fort. I
need to see another patient.

05:21.199 --> 05:23.444
Devon, tag me back in

05:23.445 --> 05:25.504
if you need help with
our detective friend.

05:28.335 --> 05:30.020
- I'm good.

Heard how your little
chess game with Dr. Bell

05:51.015 --> 05:53.800
got you the funds for your clinic.

05:53.801 --> 05:55.226
Well done.

05:56.638 --> 05:58.594
- Thank you.
- Clock my surgical board.

05:58.595 --> 06:00.286
It's a full slate.

06:00.287 --> 06:02.003
I'd like for you to work with me today,

06:02.004 --> 06:05.172
run pre-op on all my surgical patients.

06:05.747 --> 06:07.298
Why me?

06:07.299 --> 06:10.376
'Cause I demand the
best, and that's you.

06:10.377 --> 06:12.898
So ride with me through
the first wave of surgeries

06:12.899 --> 06:15.442
and you can bail
anytime after that, or...

06:15.443 --> 06:19.273
force me to find a more
cunning way to make that happen.

06:19.274 --> 06:21.090
Uh, that won't be necessary.

06:21.091 --> 06:23.317
I'm sure one day in neuro won't kill me.

06:24.036 --> 06:25.377
Or will it?

06:28.228 --> 06:30.938
No, construction business is no joke.

06:30.939 --> 06:33.071
You know, every step
is a fall or a break

06:33.072 --> 06:35.660
or a shot to the ass, in my case.

06:35.661 --> 06:38.125
I'm seeing you got shot
with a nail gun at work.

06:38.126 --> 06:41.432
- Who'd you piss off?
- Self-inflicted.

06:41.433 --> 06:42.883
Yeah, I'm a clumsy oaf.

06:42.884 --> 06:44.470
Took two to the left cheek,

06:44.471 --> 06:46.649
which threw me off-balance
and I tumbled off

06:46.650 --> 06:48.156
the second floor scaffolding.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.508
Wounds got infected and my antibiotics

06:50.509 --> 06:52.548
jacked up my kidneys real good.

06:52.549 --> 06:54.679
- So that's why you're on dialysis?
- Yeah.

06:54.680 --> 06:56.371
They say my kidneys are bouncing back.

06:56.372 --> 06:59.214
And I was feeling pretty good
until these damn migraines

06:59.215 --> 07:01.233
kicked in the last couple days.

07:02.456 --> 07:03.831
Any other pain?

07:03.832 --> 07:05.714
No.

07:05.715 --> 07:09.367
- Dizziness?
- No, but, Doc...

07:09.368 --> 07:11.995
much as I dig it here,
I think I'd really prefer

07:11.996 --> 07:13.515
something for this migraine pain.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.542
- Mm-hmm.
- ASAP, so I can get back to my work site.

07:16.543 --> 07:19.523
My guys got to pull the extra
load if I'm not there, so...

07:19.524 --> 07:20.893
Well, I'm gonna run a test panel,

07:20.894 --> 07:22.540
make sure everything's okay,
and then we'll go from there.

07:22.541 --> 07:24.309
- Good?
- Good.

07:27.262 --> 07:29.287
Make yourself comfortable.

07:29.288 --> 07:31.697
Be careful, Doc.

07:31.698 --> 07:33.909
You make things too nice,
I may never leave.

07:35.980 --> 07:38.621
This isn't an herbal
or energy supplement.

07:38.622 --> 07:40.675
It's not a daily vitamin.

07:40.676 --> 07:42.824
It's all three.

07:42.825 --> 07:45.814
The best nutritional scientists
in the country helped craft

07:45.815 --> 07:47.657
this groundbreaking product.

07:47.658 --> 07:49.902
Six years

07:49.903 --> 07:54.498
and every disposable dime
I had is on this table.

07:54.499 --> 07:57.408
Put the Chastain name on the product,

07:57.409 --> 08:00.844
give me your brand in
marketing, and together

08:00.845 --> 08:04.406
we will sell millions
of units, guaranteed.

08:08.212 --> 08:10.513
I'm sorry, this isn't real medicine.

08:13.503 --> 08:14.878
I get it.

08:14.879 --> 08:16.887
The supplement business is littered

08:16.888 --> 08:18.703
with con artists selling snake oil,

08:18.704 --> 08:22.361
and they are cleaning up
in a $122 billion industry.

08:22.362 --> 08:24.104
It is the Wild, Wild West out there,

08:24.105 --> 08:26.210
and supplements aren't
regulated by the FDA.

08:26.211 --> 08:29.515
Look, I get that this is
outside of your comfort zone,

08:29.516 --> 08:32.366
but you can trust me.

08:32.366 --> 08:34.779
My products are the real deal.

08:34.780 --> 08:38.707
All I'm asking is for
you to give me a chance.

08:41.207 --> 08:43.214
You know, a hospital like Chastain

08:43.215 --> 08:45.623
can only associate itself

08:45.624 --> 08:48.340
with the highest
standard of medical care.

08:48.341 --> 08:50.109
And we don't take chances.

08:51.366 --> 08:52.466
Thank you.

09:04.593 --> 09:07.094
Steady. I want him in
the OR in one piece.

09:07.095 --> 09:09.302
How bad is it, fellas? Talk to me.

09:09.303 --> 09:11.557
- Detective, we got this. Relax.
- Not possible.

09:11.558 --> 09:12.583
I'm coming with you.

09:12.584 --> 09:14.202
Time to fight the law and win, Pravesh.

09:14.203 --> 09:16.520
You're not allowed in the OR.
Go back to the ER for observation.

09:16.521 --> 09:18.656
Hey, I don't need observation!

09:18.657 --> 09:21.317
Detective, if you keep
following us, I will call security.

09:21.318 --> 09:23.626
I have had ICE removed, I
will have you removed, too.

09:23.627 --> 09:25.686
Intern don't play.

09:27.824 --> 09:29.664
He's in V-fib.

09:29.665 --> 09:32.399
Okay, I got no pulse. Yeah,
we need to start CPR right now.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.184
Get these cuffs off. We can't roll him

09:34.185 --> 09:35.965
onto his back or move the impalement.

09:37.308 --> 09:39.350
All right, let's start
compressions from both sides.

09:39.351 --> 09:41.285
- Me and you, Pravesh.
- Let's go.

09:42.479 --> 09:45.315
Easy, guys.

09:45.316 --> 09:47.650
Better.

09:47.651 --> 09:49.168
Let's go!

09:52.723 --> 09:55.009
Remember, Docs, he dies,

09:55.010 --> 09:56.172
hostage dies.

10:05.170 --> 10:08.350
- He's crashing again.
- All right, back at it.

10:08.351 --> 10:10.158
Do we have code meds?

10:10.159 --> 10:11.373
What he needs is blood.

10:11.374 --> 10:13.666
- He's been down too long.
- Okay, he's coding.

10:13.667 --> 10:15.594
Chu, you know what to do.

10:15.595 --> 10:17.671
- Drape and intubate.
- You got it.

10:17.672 --> 10:20.765
Nurse, take my place.
Nolan, scrub room with me.

10:22.533 --> 10:25.735
I'm in. Hang two units
of O neg and start pressors.

10:25.736 --> 10:29.170
All right, let's go.
On my count? One, two, three.

10:32.784 --> 10:33.889
Get his back.

10:33.890 --> 10:36.528
Guy's got a steel bar
rammed through his chest.

10:36.529 --> 10:38.656
Mostly, you don't survive that.

10:38.657 --> 10:42.534
Adjust the attitude.
It's my OR, my outcome,

10:42.535 --> 10:44.203
and I say he lives.

10:44.204 --> 10:46.255
Aye, aye.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.518
Come on, Pravesh, I
need a living patient.

10:49.519 --> 10:51.477
I cannot operate on dead people.

10:51.478 --> 10:54.597
Well, I suppose I could, but why bother?

10:54.598 --> 10:57.691
Holding compressions. Pulse check.

11:00.307 --> 11:02.104
Sinus tach. Strong carotid pulse.

11:02.105 --> 11:04.723
Congratulations, Pravesh.
You just saved the life

11:04.724 --> 11:07.944
of a truly detestable human being.

11:07.945 --> 11:08.945
Ten blade.

11:11.365 --> 11:12.448
Make this quick, Doc.

11:12.449 --> 11:14.126
I'm gonna be at Rob Spiro's bedside

11:14.127 --> 11:16.044
the moment he comes out of surgery.

11:16.045 --> 11:17.661
Did you take any blows to the chest?

11:18.725 --> 11:20.698
Did three tours in Afghanistan.

11:20.699 --> 11:22.366
IED blew up my Humvee.

11:22.367 --> 11:23.551
Couldn't hear for a week.

11:23.552 --> 11:27.871
Think I went to see a doctor? Not once.

11:27.872 --> 11:29.465
It's called strength of character.

11:29.466 --> 11:33.419
Yeah, I did two tours myself,

11:33.420 --> 11:36.732
and anytime I have health
issues, I still see a doctor.

11:36.733 --> 11:38.324
It's called not being an idiot.

11:41.812 --> 11:43.646
What unit?

11:43.647 --> 11:46.598
Navy corpsman. Third
Battalion Seventh Marines.

11:46.599 --> 11:49.151
Battle of Sangin.

11:49.152 --> 11:52.287
Heard that was a hell
of a time, brother.

11:55.079 --> 11:57.438
You have any head pain?

11:57.439 --> 11:59.209
You're damn right I do.

11:59.210 --> 12:01.220
He hit me in the head
with a two-by-four.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.531
Squeeze my fingers.

12:02.532 --> 12:05.282
Ah. Doc, not with this one.

12:05.283 --> 12:07.259
He stepped on my hand twice here.

12:09.217 --> 12:10.613
I'm sending you for a CT scan.

12:10.614 --> 12:12.707
No. Not a chance.

12:12.708 --> 12:14.954
You may have life-threatening injuries.

12:14.955 --> 12:17.203
In order to do my job,
I need more information

12:17.204 --> 12:18.462
than just a standard exam.

12:19.670 --> 12:21.028
Nah.

12:21.029 --> 12:23.745
All right.

12:23.746 --> 12:25.828
How about we start with
an X-ray of your hand?

12:25.829 --> 12:28.056
They're cheap and fast.

12:28.057 --> 12:31.134
And it will help me with
the diagnosis, brother.

12:31.135 --> 12:32.894
Hey.

12:32.895 --> 12:35.421
They're deep into Spiro's surgery.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.806
He's touch and go.

12:36.807 --> 12:39.876
If I didn't need information from him,

12:39.877 --> 12:41.403
I'd tell your guys to let him perish.

12:41.404 --> 12:43.646
It doesn't work that way around here.

12:43.647 --> 12:45.815
Oh, yeah? How's it work?

12:45.816 --> 12:49.152
Saints, sinners, and
everything in between.

12:49.153 --> 12:50.477
We treat them all.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.771
It doesn't matter what they've done

12:51.772 --> 12:53.113
before they come through our doors.

12:53.114 --> 12:55.423
You don't care about their past.

12:55.424 --> 12:57.276
I have to care about the future.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.736
Another few hours pass,

12:58.737 --> 13:00.942
some bad guys with an innocent
man are gonna realize

13:00.943 --> 13:03.833
they could run a lot
faster without a hostage.

13:03.834 --> 13:06.002
That happens, they'll put him down

13:06.003 --> 13:07.337
like a dog.

13:07.338 --> 13:10.122
Please, do whatever you need to do

13:10.123 --> 13:11.920
so I can get what I need.

13:11.921 --> 13:14.221
That way, nobody else has to die.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.638
I'm so sorry.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.917
This is embarrassing. I don't
know why I'm crying.

13:27.918 --> 13:29.908
Because you're human and you're scared.

13:31.937 --> 13:36.148
I mean... spine surgery.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.626
On my spine.

13:37.627 --> 13:39.318
All those nerves.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.510
It's dangerous and I
don't want to do it.

13:41.511 --> 13:43.828
I don't.

13:43.829 --> 13:47.391
But the pain and weakness,

13:47.392 --> 13:49.101
and I miss my life, but...

13:49.102 --> 13:52.286
One step at a time, okay? Here.

13:54.459 --> 13:58.054
This is your MRI.

13:58.055 --> 14:00.965
See the narrowing right here.

14:00.966 --> 14:03.676
It's putting pressure
on your spinal cord.

14:03.677 --> 14:06.636
It's called spinal stenosis,
and what Dr. Cain wants to do

14:06.637 --> 14:07.991
is a very common procedure

14:07.992 --> 14:09.565
called a laminectomy.

14:09.566 --> 14:11.316
That's just gonna open up some space.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.494
Only takes about an hour,

14:12.495 --> 14:14.570
and I'll be there to make
sure everything runs

14:14.571 --> 14:15.571
as smoothly as it can.

14:16.561 --> 14:19.061
Your surgery's at 4:15, so I'll
probably have someone come up

14:19.062 --> 14:21.005
about a half hour before
to take you to the OR.

14:21.006 --> 14:23.579
Thank you for taking
the time to tell me.

14:23.580 --> 14:25.865
Sorry, fog... frog in my throat.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.251
How long have you had that?

14:28.252 --> 14:30.035
Last month or so.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.538
Hmm.

14:32.539 --> 14:36.542
Do you have any blurred
vision? Difficulty swallowing?

14:36.543 --> 14:39.837
Yes. Is that a problem?

14:39.838 --> 14:42.506
It could be. Let me talk to Dr. Cain.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.430
You hang in there, okay?

14:44.431 --> 14:47.553
I will be with you the
whole way, I promise.

14:47.554 --> 14:48.712
♪ Get busy... ♪

14:48.713 --> 14:51.390

15:03.087 --> 15:05.071
Let's, um, let's take
a five-minute break.

15:05.072 --> 15:08.302
Stretch, hydrate, and we're back, okay?

15:08.303 --> 15:10.460
Good work.

15:10.461 --> 15:12.053
If you are here to scold me

15:12.054 --> 15:13.796
about fake medicine,
you can save your breath.

15:13.797 --> 15:15.281
I'm broke. All right?

15:15.282 --> 15:17.465
The business is finished.
I'm dissolving the company.

15:17.466 --> 15:18.934
Your supplements have potential.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.681
You killed my pitch.

15:24.682 --> 15:27.235
You said Chastain doesn't take chances.

15:27.236 --> 15:29.595
They don't. I do.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.906
I'm the one who brought you
to the board this afternoon,

15:31.907 --> 15:33.224
and they were captivated

15:33.225 --> 15:35.100
by your passion, your confidence,

15:35.101 --> 15:36.911
your obvious intellect.

15:36.912 --> 15:40.272
Your presentation was
flawless. I'm not surprised.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.177
You used me as a test case.

15:42.178 --> 15:43.918
You do not want to be in business

15:43.919 --> 15:46.153
with Chastain and Red Rock.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.614
They think of profit-sharing
as a chronic disease.

15:48.615 --> 15:49.832
They will shake your hand,

15:49.833 --> 15:52.354
then drive a knife in
your back at the same time.

15:52.355 --> 15:54.321
Listen, Andrea, I've spent the last year

15:54.322 --> 15:56.789
educating myself on
the world of supplements

15:56.790 --> 15:58.981
and, specifically, your company.

15:58.982 --> 16:00.569
I watch its every move,

16:00.570 --> 16:03.772
and unfortunately you've been
walking into the wrong rooms.

16:03.773 --> 16:06.298
There's nowhere left to go.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.691
You're out of gas.

16:08.944 --> 16:10.682
What are you proposing?

16:10.683 --> 16:13.430
The amazing qualities you
already bring to the table

16:13.431 --> 16:14.862
plus my face

16:14.863 --> 16:17.222
and the name Dr. Randolph Bell,

16:17.223 --> 16:19.531
CEO and Chief of Surgery

16:19.532 --> 16:21.607
on the label of millions of bottles

16:21.608 --> 16:22.709
of our supplements.

16:29.965 --> 16:31.707
Rick.

16:31.708 --> 16:33.784
Hate to kick you out of this plush room,

16:33.785 --> 16:35.362
but all your tests came back negative.

16:35.363 --> 16:36.679
So, you got, uh,

16:36.680 --> 16:39.004
normal electrolytes,
normal blood counts.

16:39.005 --> 16:40.254
You got a history of migraines,

16:40.255 --> 16:41.495
uh, this is presenting as another one.

16:41.496 --> 16:42.793
I know that's not fun, but if you

16:42.794 --> 16:44.050
can handle a nail gun to the ass,

16:44.051 --> 16:45.733
you can handle this.

16:45.734 --> 16:48.716
Hey, kidding aside, that's a relief.

16:48.717 --> 16:49.976
With my dialysis,

16:49.977 --> 16:51.986
I was starting to think
maybe it was something else,

16:51.987 --> 16:54.680
- but...
- Yeah, well, I'll write you a prescription,

16:54.681 --> 16:56.399
- should help you out with your migraines.
- Hey.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.784
- Thanks a bunch, Dr. Hawkins.
- All right, my pleasure.

17:01.330 --> 17:05.074
Rick? Rick?

17:05.075 --> 17:06.791
Code Blue!

17:08.207 --> 17:11.363
Code Blue, room 5417.

17:11.364 --> 17:15.300
- I need some help in here!
- Code Blue, room 5417.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.334
Oh, my God.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.727
What happened to my patient?

17:27.213 --> 17:29.173
Complaining of migraines,

17:29.174 --> 17:32.527
tests came back negative, then he coded.

17:32.528 --> 17:36.197
- Any new medications?
- Just on all the standard stuff.

17:36.198 --> 17:38.015
Doxazosin, a statin,

17:38.016 --> 17:40.517
- an EPO med.
- Could you have missed something?

17:40.518 --> 17:43.037
Maybe you need to ask
yourself that question.

17:43.038 --> 17:44.476
That's exactly what I've been doing...

17:44.477 --> 17:46.006
Because he received spotless
care under my supervision.

17:46.007 --> 17:48.877
- Well, something went wrong.
- What are you implying, Dr. Hawkins?

17:48.878 --> 17:50.794
I just want answers.

17:53.018 --> 17:54.698
We'll get them soon enough.

18:06.159 --> 18:08.604
- Have you seen Dr. Cain?
- Uh-huh.

18:14.842 --> 18:16.308
Are you here just to watch him?

18:17.889 --> 18:19.482
Is that so wrong?

18:19.483 --> 18:23.227
Nurse Sally watched
him yesterday, twice.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.896
Dr. Cain?

18:25.897 --> 18:27.979
You haven't sealed off the aneurysm yet.

18:27.980 --> 18:29.583
Place an 8.6-millimeter coil.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.588
- Yes?
- I need to talk to you

18:33.589 --> 18:34.928
about your pre-op patient, Mia Danvers.

18:34.929 --> 18:36.149
Okay, go ahead, but hurry.

18:36.150 --> 18:38.927
I think she may have something
other than spinal stenosis.

18:38.928 --> 18:41.412
No, Rodriguez, you need more stability.

18:41.413 --> 18:44.123
Add an interbody spacer to
the posterior vertebral body.

18:44.124 --> 18:47.009
And you completed seven years
of neurosurgery residency?

18:47.010 --> 18:48.937
I'm a nurse practitioner.

18:48.938 --> 18:52.065
Yes, exactly, and why
is a nurse practitioner

18:52.066 --> 18:53.757
trying to re-diagnose my patient?

18:53.758 --> 18:56.062
Full stop. You recruited
me to work on your unit.

18:56.063 --> 18:57.690
Mia Danvers has atypical symptoms.

18:57.691 --> 18:58.772
I want to run some tests.

18:58.773 --> 19:00.448
This is all healthy brain
tissue. Good margins.

19:00.449 --> 19:01.674
Nice work, Timmons.

19:01.675 --> 19:04.118
You can run as many tests as you like.

19:04.119 --> 19:08.364
Mia Danvers will be on my
table in OR One at 4:15.

19:08.365 --> 19:10.792
Dr. Cain, do you always
let your residents operate

19:10.793 --> 19:12.460
when you're not in the room?

19:12.461 --> 19:14.461
Dr. Meyer, call Admitting.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.494
I am there for the crucial
part of each surgery.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.138
Always?

19:24.139 --> 19:26.506
My residents are second to none.
They rarely make mistakes.

19:26.507 --> 19:29.983
And if they do, yes, I'm
always there to correct them.

19:29.984 --> 19:32.487
So have no fear, Nurse Nevin.

19:32.488 --> 19:34.547
All is well.

19:46.495 --> 19:49.980
Do I detect notes of mango and chia?

19:49.981 --> 19:52.649
A delightful hint of acai?

19:52.650 --> 19:55.319
They say it increases stamina.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.474
Yeah, but, I mean, is that,
like, scientifically proven?

19:58.475 --> 19:59.504
Proof's not required.

19:59.505 --> 20:01.609
People believe what
they want to believe.

20:01.610 --> 20:03.344
The placebo effect works.

20:03.345 --> 20:07.181
If you think that acai will
give you an energy boost,

20:07.182 --> 20:08.457
chances are,

20:08.458 --> 20:10.760
it will.

20:10.761 --> 20:12.139
But why you?

20:12.140 --> 20:14.430
I mean, you're already,
like, a top dog doctor.

20:14.431 --> 20:15.751
I mean, you're Dr. freaking Bell.

20:18.226 --> 20:19.861
You ever heard of the amazing Dr. Oz?

20:19.862 --> 20:21.845
Yeah, sure.

20:21.846 --> 20:23.347
Dr. Sanjay Gupta?

20:23.348 --> 20:25.709
The-the dude on CNN.
Yeah, I love that guy.

20:25.710 --> 20:27.723
Before you walked through
the doors of Chastain,

20:27.724 --> 20:30.112
had you ever heard of Dr. Randolph Bell?

20:30.113 --> 20:32.874
No.

20:32.875 --> 20:35.584
They're household names, I'm not.

20:37.880 --> 20:41.957
But a $5 million investment
will get me in the game.

20:41.958 --> 20:44.184
So we need to find someone close

20:44.185 --> 20:46.427
with very deep pockets.

20:46.428 --> 20:49.158
That's, uh, kind of steep, Dr. B.

20:49.159 --> 20:50.921
I mean, who would pony
up that kind of cash?

20:50.922 --> 20:54.711
I'm gonna give you a hint.
Who do we both know

20:54.712 --> 20:57.147
who's local, wealthy,
and has capital to spare?

20:58.624 --> 21:00.357
Who has offices in Buckhead

21:00.358 --> 21:03.088
and made his money
betting on risky ventures?

21:05.407 --> 21:07.742
Who contributed half your DNA?

21:07.743 --> 21:10.795
Oh, my-my pops! My dad.

21:10.796 --> 21:12.951
- Ah.
- Set up a meeting, stat.

21:12.952 --> 21:14.664
Yeah, you got it, boss.

21:21.636 --> 21:23.769
Hey.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.838
- You okay?
- Yeah.

21:28.839 --> 21:30.747
You don't look okay.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.265
What's up?

21:33.255 --> 21:36.281
A patient of mine...

21:36.282 --> 21:39.025
everything seemed fine.

21:39.026 --> 21:41.960
Was about to discharge
him, and then he just...

21:41.961 --> 21:43.527
coded.

21:43.528 --> 21:48.181
No signs, no symptoms. Dead
before he hit the floor.

21:48.182 --> 21:51.360
- I'm so sorry.
- I keep going over everything in my head.

21:51.361 --> 21:53.078
What did I miss?

21:54.790 --> 21:57.495
I have to figure out why.
Why-why did it happen?

21:57.496 --> 21:59.610
You will. Here.

22:01.052 --> 22:03.529
It's okay.

22:06.569 --> 22:07.576
Here you go, sir.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.874
Well, the good news is
your hand isn't broken.

22:12.875 --> 22:16.321
- Hallelujah. I'm out of here, man.
- But...

22:16.322 --> 22:18.211
something else must be
wrong, so I'm keeping you

22:18.212 --> 22:20.222
in the hospital a little while
longer, run some more tests.

22:20.223 --> 22:22.093
Doc. No. Come on.

22:22.094 --> 22:23.985
You're being ridiculous, man.

22:23.986 --> 22:26.132
I'm not discharging you
until I'm a hundred percent

22:26.133 --> 22:27.655
positive you're okay.

22:27.656 --> 22:29.164
You should call someone.

22:29.165 --> 22:31.159
Get them to bring you
a change of clothes,

22:31.160 --> 22:32.385
and you'll need a medical proxy.

22:32.386 --> 22:33.569
Is it looking that
bad for me over there?

22:33.570 --> 22:36.146
It's just standard protocol.

22:36.147 --> 22:37.689
Aw, shh...

22:37.690 --> 22:39.575
Damn, gonna be honest, man.

22:39.576 --> 22:41.502
Besides an ex-wife and
a few drinking buddies,

22:41.503 --> 22:44.038
nobody's gonna come bring
me a fresh pair of underwear.

22:44.039 --> 22:45.489
You know...

22:45.490 --> 22:47.798
or make no medical
decisions for me, man.

22:47.799 --> 22:49.844
I've spent the last
five years thinking about

22:49.845 --> 22:51.420
catching bad guys.

22:51.421 --> 22:53.038
Especially the one you got in your OR

22:53.039 --> 22:55.964
right now. Everything else, every...

22:55.965 --> 22:58.298
everyone else became background noise.

23:00.689 --> 23:02.190
You all right?

23:02.191 --> 23:05.043
Look out. Can't see that good.

23:05.044 --> 23:07.052
Around the edges.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.271
Can I have a look?

23:09.272 --> 23:10.405
Ah...

23:11.441 --> 23:12.674
Nurse?

23:14.359 --> 23:16.601
I need some fluids. He's hypotensive.

23:17.512 --> 23:19.064
Hey, Detective.

23:19.065 --> 23:20.357
Time to wake up.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.544
Hey.

23:26.616 --> 23:28.073
What the hell happened?

23:28.074 --> 23:31.294
You passed out. You can
be mad at me all you want.

23:31.295 --> 23:33.187
Keeping you in the hospital.

23:41.366 --> 23:42.766
You're lucky to be alive, you know.

24:01.024 --> 24:02.932
The cop said you once crammed yourself

24:02.933 --> 24:04.608
underneath a kitchen sink for hours

24:04.609 --> 24:05.831
during a home invasion.

24:05.832 --> 24:07.403
That true?

24:11.571 --> 24:13.463
Do you ever get pain in
your knees and joints?

24:16.456 --> 24:18.915
Yeah. Always.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.052
How'd you know that?

24:26.697 --> 24:28.556
That hurt?

24:28.557 --> 24:30.427
I don't feel it.

24:30.428 --> 24:32.137
Elastic skin,

24:32.138 --> 24:33.447
abnormal flexibility,

24:33.448 --> 24:35.524
atrophic scars...

24:35.525 --> 24:37.434
and pseudotumors.

24:37.435 --> 24:39.787
I think you might have
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

24:39.788 --> 24:42.147
They call it the Stretch
Armstrong disease.

24:42.148 --> 24:45.776
It is associated with aneurysms.

24:45.777 --> 24:48.211
They can burst at any time.

24:49.947 --> 24:51.631
Do you have kids?

24:53.209 --> 24:54.493
A d... a daughter.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.619
Why?

24:55.620 --> 24:58.306
Ehlers-Danlos is genetic.

24:58.307 --> 25:01.976
If she has aneurysms,
it can be very dangerous.

25:01.977 --> 25:04.853
She's going to need
aggressive surveillance.

25:06.028 --> 25:08.057
You mean she can die from it?

25:08.058 --> 25:09.841
Yes.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.469
But I can manage her care.

25:12.470 --> 25:14.989
I'd like to see her.

25:14.990 --> 25:18.850
I got no idea where she is.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.162
I haven't spoken to her in ten years.

25:21.163 --> 25:23.497
She wants nothing to do with me.

25:23.498 --> 25:24.981
Do you have a phone number?

25:24.982 --> 25:26.191
Mm.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.859
How about a name?

25:27.860 --> 25:29.402
I can track her down.

25:35.085 --> 25:38.087
Everybody dies of something.

25:50.392 --> 25:52.330
Intimal flap on the aorta root.

25:52.331 --> 25:54.028
Aortic dissection.

25:54.029 --> 25:56.721
And look at all these discontinuities.

25:56.722 --> 25:59.057
Thoracic and lumbar spinal fractures.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.035
All from a fistfight?

26:01.036 --> 26:02.894
A lifetime of fistfights.

26:04.206 --> 26:06.281
I'll break the news to him.

26:06.282 --> 26:08.542
I'll page cardio and neuro.

26:08.543 --> 26:10.068
Raptor and Cain?

26:10.069 --> 26:12.420
That should be interesting.

26:14.740 --> 26:18.009
Okay, my friend, we
looked at your scans.

26:19.129 --> 26:21.389
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:21.390 --> 26:23.465
Whoa, easy.

26:23.466 --> 26:25.584
There you go.

26:25.585 --> 26:28.304
Wow. I've delivered enough bad news

26:28.305 --> 26:31.089
in my career to know that look.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.758
Rip off the Band-Aid, Hawkins.

26:33.759 --> 26:36.237
You have an aortic dissection

26:36.238 --> 26:38.647
and multiple fractures in your spine.

26:38.648 --> 26:42.076
Separately, neither would be dangerous.

26:42.077 --> 26:43.652
Together...

26:43.653 --> 26:44.744
It's time for prayer?

26:45.897 --> 26:47.278
I'm prepping the OR now.

26:47.279 --> 26:49.324
Chastain has the best
surgeons in Atlanta.

26:49.325 --> 26:50.525
Your odds are good.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.546
You be honest with me.

26:56.782 --> 26:59.334
If the operation doesn't kill me,

26:59.335 --> 27:02.971
could it put me in a wheelchair?

27:10.346 --> 27:12.814
Got to be able to be a cop.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.650
Yeah.

27:18.137 --> 27:21.431
If I can't be a cop...

27:21.432 --> 27:23.867
life's not worth living.

27:26.103 --> 27:28.413
Let's not go there.

27:30.033 --> 27:32.000
What is your backup plan?

27:35.538 --> 27:38.673
What would you do if
you couldn't be a doctor?

27:44.639 --> 27:46.640
Captain.

27:46.641 --> 27:49.834
Detective Raines is headed
into surgery as we speak.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.855
- Is he gonna be okay?
- It's serious but repairable.

27:52.856 --> 27:55.618
- I'll keep you all posted, I promise.
- Please do.

27:55.619 --> 27:58.388
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?

27:59.729 --> 28:01.155
I have a favor to ask.

28:01.156 --> 28:02.514
Anything. Name it.

28:02.515 --> 28:04.309
I need a phone number or an address

28:04.310 --> 28:05.993
for Rob Spiro's daughter.

28:05.994 --> 28:07.806
She could be in serious
medical jeopardy.

28:07.807 --> 28:10.355
- I need to examine her.
- Look, respect for your profession,

28:10.356 --> 28:13.834
but don't waste another second
on that animal or his family.

28:13.835 --> 28:15.819
She didn't choose her father.

28:15.820 --> 28:17.671
You're blaming the victim.

28:17.672 --> 28:19.173
You're a cop. Aren't you supposed

28:19.174 --> 28:20.340
to do the exact opposite?

28:24.245 --> 28:26.285
Dr. Hawkins, I was
just about to call you.

28:26.286 --> 28:28.039
You got the results
of my dialysis patient?

28:28.040 --> 28:30.259
Reason he dropped dead without warning

28:30.260 --> 28:32.730
is he had a massive pulmonary embolism.

28:32.731 --> 28:34.279
He's not the only one.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.022
We've had five other patients drop dead

28:36.023 --> 28:38.622
from massive P.E.s just
in the past six weeks.

28:38.623 --> 28:39.884
At Chastain?

28:39.885 --> 28:42.029
In the past six weeks?

28:42.030 --> 28:43.738
All dialysis patients.

28:46.734 --> 28:49.872
Nic's sister Jessie Nevin, she
was a dialysis patient here.

28:55.735 --> 28:58.403
First the robber, now the cop.

28:58.404 --> 29:01.355
They're all the same on the inside.

29:01.356 --> 29:02.574
Yeah.

29:16.639 --> 29:18.923
Dr. Austin.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.358
Dr. Cain.

29:26.338 --> 29:29.397
We'll be repairing
the aortic dissection first.

29:29.398 --> 29:31.895
Happy for you to assist, but you will be

29:31.896 --> 29:34.576
- doctor number two.
- Well, it's an interesting proposition,

29:34.577 --> 29:35.899
but I'm no one's assistant.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.942
I'm certainly not number two.

29:39.570 --> 29:42.238
Well, then you can
monitor the nerve function.

29:42.239 --> 29:45.426
Or I can repair the
spinal fracture first.

29:45.427 --> 29:47.786
The aorta is the priority.

29:47.787 --> 29:50.288
- It's literally tearing apart.
- The spinal cord

29:50.289 --> 29:52.627
is being transected... it
could literally paralyze him.

29:52.628 --> 29:54.768
The aortic dissection
could kill him on the spot.

29:56.962 --> 29:59.647
Doctor number three is gonna go prep.

30:06.615 --> 30:10.359
Okay, last stitch...

30:10.360 --> 30:14.788
and the aortic root
has been reconstructed.

30:14.789 --> 30:16.957
You're missing a step
in the Yacoub technique.

30:16.958 --> 30:18.341
No, this is the David technique...

30:18.342 --> 30:19.576
it's what we'd prefer at Stanford.

30:19.577 --> 30:21.820
Not at Hopkins. Our studies
show a lower mortality rate.

30:21.821 --> 30:24.632
Only when the aortic annulus
is less than 27 millimeters.

30:24.633 --> 30:26.041
Our patient is 28 millimeters.

30:26.042 --> 30:27.492
Then reinforce the suture lines.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.285
Coronaries need to
be properly reperfused

30:29.286 --> 30:30.762
before you restart his heart.

30:32.777 --> 30:34.492
We're good,

30:34.493 --> 30:36.126
but thank you.

30:36.127 --> 30:37.769
Take him off bypass.

30:45.820 --> 30:48.629
- We don't want our guy to get an M.I.
- I'll handle the heart.

30:48.630 --> 30:50.047
You stick with the brain.

30:50.048 --> 30:51.855
Brain commands the heart.

30:51.856 --> 30:54.191
Yeah, well, the heart powers the brain.

31:01.652 --> 31:02.885
All right, Nolan,

31:02.886 --> 31:04.529
go ahead and decannulate.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.780
Time to make space

31:05.781 --> 31:08.969
so doctor number two
can access the spine.

31:08.970 --> 31:10.820
You're more than welcome
to stay afterwards.

31:10.821 --> 31:14.063
Be happy to have you retract
a few layers of soft tissue.

31:14.064 --> 31:15.257
Someone has to do it.

31:16.926 --> 31:18.635
- Patient's crashing.
- What the hell?

31:18.636 --> 31:20.543
- This was an easy access.
- Aneurysm rupture.

31:20.544 --> 31:21.838
Get the cell saver.

31:21.839 --> 31:24.841
I'm gonna use my hands
to stop the bleed.

31:30.848 --> 31:33.367
Bleeding stopped. Good call.

31:33.368 --> 31:34.776
All right.

31:37.814 --> 31:39.540
The tear spread through the iliac.

31:39.541 --> 31:40.541
Grab the vascular clamps.

31:42.070 --> 31:43.193
Go proximal.

31:44.713 --> 31:45.938
- Done.
- Now distal.

31:45.939 --> 31:47.100
He's about to code.

31:48.041 --> 31:50.241
It's on the backside. I can't
see where the tear ends.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.719
All right, all right, all right.

31:51.720 --> 31:52.886
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:52.887 --> 31:54.054
Okay, right here.

31:54.055 --> 31:55.838
Slide the clamp along my fingers.

31:57.951 --> 31:59.250
Got it.

32:07.643 --> 32:09.068
Blood pressure stabilized.

32:11.293 --> 32:13.907
Well done, doctor number one.

32:13.908 --> 32:16.076
Back at you, doctor number two.

32:16.077 --> 32:17.560
Yeah.

32:17.561 --> 32:18.820
You know, I've been

32:18.821 --> 32:20.730
in the health care field a long time,

32:20.731 --> 32:23.900
and I have never seen
anything so promising.

32:23.901 --> 32:28.571
Supplements are a $122 billion industry

32:28.572 --> 32:30.757
with multiple areas of growth.

32:32.576 --> 32:34.493
Shift your weight forward and down.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.378
Get more distance on your shot.

32:38.007 --> 32:40.267
And collagen? On fire.

32:40.268 --> 32:42.960
30% growth, $100 million.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.004
With my medical reputation
and your business savvy,

32:45.005 --> 32:46.440
we can make a fortune.

32:46.441 --> 32:49.976
Uh, make sure your hands
don't cross the swing plane.

32:54.098 --> 32:58.026
This can be good for Grayson, as well.

32:58.027 --> 32:59.953
Give a bright young man
with a few bad habits

32:59.954 --> 33:02.313
some guidance.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.533
Get your son started on a new path.

33:09.872 --> 33:11.672
Magnificent effort.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.951
The shot or the pitch?

33:14.952 --> 33:16.761
Both.

33:19.715 --> 33:22.792
Let's draw up the papers.

33:22.793 --> 33:25.646
Just, uh... one ground rule

33:25.647 --> 33:28.298
before going to business together.

33:28.299 --> 33:30.842
Fire away. No secrets between partners.

33:30.843 --> 33:33.228
No more schtupping my wife.

33:44.201 --> 33:48.001
_

33:51.564 --> 33:54.564
_

33:58.915 --> 34:00.915
_

34:04.543 --> 34:07.478
Here are the lab results you ordered.

34:09.040 --> 34:12.540
_

34:15.771 --> 34:17.572
Mia Danvers doesn't need surgery.

34:20.356 --> 34:22.273
- Hey. In a rush?
- Hey.

34:22.274 --> 34:23.750
My patient with spinal stenosis...

34:23.751 --> 34:25.601
turns out she has myasthenia gravis.

34:25.603 --> 34:27.202
That's what's causing all her symptoms?

34:27.203 --> 34:29.342
Yes. And we can treat it
with meds. I just need Cain

34:29.342 --> 34:31.034
to cancel the surgery. I don't
want him opening her up

34:31.036 --> 34:32.119
if he doesn't have to.

34:35.625 --> 34:38.701
Cain finished early on Detective Raines.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.462
Probably squeezed your patient

34:40.463 --> 34:42.246
- into the OR.
- Damn it.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.674
- Did you need something from me?
- It can wait. Go.

34:56.300 --> 34:57.434
Ten blade.

35:05.747 --> 35:08.398
I don't understand.
You didn't do the surgery?

35:08.399 --> 35:10.458
Turns out you have what's
called myasthenia gravis.

35:10.459 --> 35:12.160
It's an autoimmune disease.

35:12.161 --> 35:14.612
It can be controlled
through the medication.

35:14.613 --> 35:18.408
Oh, thank you so much, Dr. Cain.

35:18.409 --> 35:20.669
Thank Nurse Nevin. She's
the one that caught it.

35:26.434 --> 35:28.483
She seems relieved.

35:28.484 --> 35:30.152
Take one guess how
much your due diligence

35:30.153 --> 35:32.263
cost this hospital today. No, allow me.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.775
Mia's surgery would have
run 75 grand, give or take,

35:34.776 --> 35:37.468
not including the recovery,
so let's just call it

35:37.469 --> 35:40.595
$150,000 all-in.

35:40.596 --> 35:42.437
I'm not in the business

35:42.438 --> 35:44.289
of putting people into
surgery if they don't need it.

35:44.290 --> 35:48.535
Which is exactly why I handpicked you.

35:48.536 --> 35:50.987
It should come as no surprise
that I'd like to offer you

35:50.988 --> 35:53.540
a permanent position on
my neurosurgery staff.

35:53.541 --> 35:55.709
Give you more opportunities to shine,

35:55.710 --> 35:57.952
make a lot more money
than you're making now.

35:57.953 --> 36:01.990
But I'm guessing you don't care
so much about that last part.

36:03.459 --> 36:05.487
Take your time. Think about it.

36:05.488 --> 36:07.670
I have another surgery to do,

36:07.671 --> 36:09.839
which is no doubt a necessary one.

36:09.840 --> 36:12.567
Have to make up for lost revenue.

36:22.361 --> 36:23.718
The corporate structure

36:23.719 --> 36:25.946
will be an LLC with partner ownership

36:25.947 --> 36:28.408
vesting in two-year increments,
which is standard,

36:28.409 --> 36:30.410
and starting at ten percent.

36:30.411 --> 36:33.696
Except for me. I'll own 65%.

36:33.697 --> 36:35.531
Any advance of money...

36:35.532 --> 36:37.992
He'll own 65%?

36:37.993 --> 36:39.869
How much money is he investing?

36:39.870 --> 36:42.589
- Six.
- Six...

36:42.590 --> 36:43.998
Million.

36:43.999 --> 36:45.667
Be deemed a debt
owed by the partnership

36:45.668 --> 36:48.378
and not an increase in
capital contribution...

36:48.379 --> 36:51.411
Why didn't you tell me
that you'd reconciled

36:51.412 --> 36:54.550
- with your husband?
- It was only three weeks ago.

36:54.551 --> 36:58.489
We're keeping things
open this time around.

36:58.490 --> 37:00.056
Does he know that?

37:00.898 --> 37:02.139
Any questions?

37:05.793 --> 37:07.121
To new partners.

37:08.078 --> 37:09.504
And some old ones.

37:11.607 --> 37:13.416
This is gonna be awesome.

37:13.417 --> 37:16.239
- L'chaim.
- L'chaim.

37:25.249 --> 37:29.043
So, Doc...

37:29.044 --> 37:30.728
am I gonna live?

37:38.571 --> 37:40.446
Surgery was a success.

37:43.651 --> 37:45.576
Thank you.

37:49.082 --> 37:51.607
Uh...

37:51.608 --> 37:54.086
What about Spiro?

37:54.087 --> 37:56.112
The son of a bitch gonna make it?

37:56.113 --> 37:58.172
He should. He's recovering.

37:59.259 --> 38:02.118
I'm gonna need to see him.

38:02.119 --> 38:04.096
No witnesses.

38:04.097 --> 38:06.493
We both know that's not gonna happen.

38:06.494 --> 38:08.052
Actually, we don't.

38:13.464 --> 38:15.189
Never broken any rules?

38:16.276 --> 38:19.427
It's written all over your face.

38:19.428 --> 38:21.596
You do whatever it takes

38:21.597 --> 38:24.599
to save people.

38:24.600 --> 38:26.993
You and me, we not that different.

38:28.990 --> 38:31.606
Spiro's crew has a hostage.

38:31.607 --> 38:34.166
His life is hanging in the balance.

38:37.297 --> 38:40.172
We're his last hope.

38:43.711 --> 38:45.594
You tell me I'm wrong.

38:49.842 --> 38:51.310
Turn off Rob's morphine.

38:51.311 --> 38:52.794
You can't be serious.

38:52.795 --> 38:55.521
And then we add a dose of Narcan.

38:57.650 --> 38:59.318
That should wake him up.

38:59.319 --> 39:00.894
His pain level would skyrocket.

39:00.895 --> 39:02.395
I want to clear his system of drugs.

39:02.396 --> 39:03.513
I'm worried about his airway.

39:03.514 --> 39:05.181
No, you're not. He would go into shock.

39:05.182 --> 39:06.773
What you're talking about is torture.

39:06.774 --> 39:08.976
What I'm talking about is this man,

39:08.977 --> 39:11.330
who will die unless Rob Spiro tells us

39:11.331 --> 39:13.489
where he's being held
and he tells us now.

39:13.490 --> 39:15.252
Conrad, I get that you are
trying to help this man,

39:15.253 --> 39:17.253
- but that...
- Don't lecture me on my motivations.

39:17.254 --> 39:18.912
Hold on a second. Wait.

39:18.913 --> 39:20.812
The cops said they
found Spiro's daughter.

39:20.813 --> 39:22.990
I can contact her, get her
to come into the hospital,

39:22.991 --> 39:24.575
and when he sees her, he
might have a change of heart.

39:24.576 --> 39:26.026
He doesn't give a damn
about his daughter.

39:26.027 --> 39:27.346
What? You don't know that.

39:27.347 --> 39:29.181
"Everybody dies of something"?

39:29.182 --> 39:31.183
His words. You told me yourself.

39:31.184 --> 39:32.926
This is not our job.

39:32.927 --> 39:35.261
We-we are doctors. We save lives.

39:35.262 --> 39:36.487
We already saved Rob's life.

39:36.488 --> 39:37.747
Now we make him a
little bit uncomfortable

39:37.748 --> 39:39.070
so that we save another.

39:39.071 --> 39:40.524
You're crossing a line.

39:42.678 --> 39:44.228
I am doing the most good

39:44.229 --> 39:45.971
for the greatest number of people.

39:52.613 --> 39:54.280
Don't do this.

39:54.281 --> 39:55.998
It has to be done.

39:58.735 --> 40:00.712
I want no part of it.

40:30.434 --> 40:32.244
Thanks, Connie. This was the scene

40:32.245 --> 40:34.079
earlier this evening at
an abandoned warehouse

40:34.080 --> 40:36.772
in Downtown Atlanta, where
an active hostage situation

40:36.773 --> 40:38.658
ended peacefully with three arrests.

40:38.659 --> 40:40.092
They rescued him, huh?

40:40.093 --> 40:42.766
Officers have emerged
with Jason Wyans,

40:42.767 --> 40:44.589
the hostage taken earlier today

40:44.590 --> 40:46.591
during yet another home invasion.

40:46.592 --> 40:47.926
Wonder how they found him.

40:47.927 --> 40:49.243
The rest of Rob Spiro's crew

40:49.244 --> 40:50.837
are now in police custody.

40:50.838 --> 40:52.955
And I wonder what's that thing I do

40:52.956 --> 40:54.898
that drives you nuts.

40:54.899 --> 40:56.962
- I've been bracing myself all day.
- I thought

40:56.963 --> 40:59.931
- you'd never ask.
- Hmm.

41:05.111 --> 41:07.736
You don't like it when I'm barefoot?

41:08.856 --> 41:10.615
What are you doing?

41:10.616 --> 41:12.692
The socks.

41:12.693 --> 41:13.693
What?

41:14.528 --> 41:17.289
You leave socks all over the place.

41:17.290 --> 41:18.676
It's the thing that makes me crazy.

41:18.677 --> 41:21.442
It's-it's like a sock
trail all over the house.

41:21.443 --> 41:22.501
No, I do not.

41:22.502 --> 41:25.130
You do. Look, there's-there's
a pair over there.

41:25.131 --> 41:26.611
Men's, size ten.

41:26.612 --> 41:28.041
Sometimes a little sweaty.

41:28.042 --> 41:30.302
Okay.

41:30.303 --> 41:33.329
- I can work on that.
- Uh...

41:33.330 --> 41:35.456
- Like, I mean...
- I will definitely

41:35.457 --> 41:37.733
- work on that.
- Like, work real hard on it.

41:37.734 --> 41:39.977
- Very hard.
- 'Cause it's... gross.

41:41.964 --> 41:44.273
Thank you.

41:48.654 --> 41:49.862
Hey.

41:51.014 --> 41:52.823
What's wrong?

41:54.853 --> 41:56.662
The patient you lost earlier?

41:59.439 --> 42:02.791
Sort of.

42:09.842 --> 42:12.752
You have been...

42:12.753 --> 42:15.521
beating yourself up over Jessie's death,

42:15.522 --> 42:18.791
about how you pushed for
the transplant surgery.

42:20.520 --> 42:22.687
What's this about, Conrad?

42:22.688 --> 42:26.118
Jessie died of a pulmonary embolism.

42:26.119 --> 42:28.470
A complication from surgery.

42:31.847 --> 42:34.241
Five other dialysis patients

42:34.242 --> 42:37.076
died at Chastain over
the last six weeks.

42:38.704 --> 42:41.163
All from pulmonary embolisms.

42:44.285 --> 42:47.069
I think whatever killed your sister,

42:47.070 --> 42:49.004
it killed them, too.

42:54.703 --> 42:56.845
We need to figure out what it was.
