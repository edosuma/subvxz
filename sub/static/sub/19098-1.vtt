03:55.760 --> 03:58.718
Ripped by thewildbunch22

04:08.600 --> 04:11.398
(man) Back up. Move back
a little bit. Stay back.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.080
Come on, let the funeral
through, huh? Stay back.

04:14.200 --> 04:18.034
Get Laura. That's the daughter.
Get a close-up.

04:20.079 --> 04:22.355
- Excuse me...
- Hey! Don't touch the camera.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.278
(in Chinese) Miss, please don't
cause any problems.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.715
We're not causing any problems.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.435
(in English) John, let's get McKenna.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.476
Captain McKenna?

04:46.840 --> 04:49.877
Captain McKenna, any leads
in the murder of Jackie Wong?

04:50.000 --> 04:51.274
Nothing.

04:51.400 --> 04:55.313
Do you think this killing means there is
a war going on in the Chinatown tongs?

04:55.440 --> 04:59.149
No, l don't. This is basically
a situation where the youth gangs

04:59.280 --> 05:02.511
are lashing out at the Establishment.

05:02.640 --> 05:06.076
The community's cooperating.
The situation's under control.

05:20.760 --> 05:23.069
Hey, kid! What's going on?

05:23.200 --> 05:27.432
- We got to talk, Lenny. Privately.
- Sure. Some funeral, huh?

05:28.120 --> 05:31.999
So, what's new, kid?
Listen, no news this week.

05:32.120 --> 05:36.591
But l got some pretty good uptown you
should try. Give you a taste for nothing.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.439
- Greaseball don't listen so good, Lenny.
- What?

05:39.560 --> 05:41.710
(in Chinese) You want to play games?

05:41.920 --> 05:44.992
(in English) lt's loud and clear.
This is our street now.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.554
You wanna stay on this street, you pay us.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.272
Come on, Ronnie. Me?

05:49.400 --> 05:53.951
You wanna extort money from me?
You know who my cousins are?

05:54.080 --> 05:56.640
(in Chinese) l know what l need to know.

05:56.760 --> 06:00.673
(in English) Fuck your cousins. No one
rides free any more. You owe me money.

06:00.800 --> 06:05.271
It's 300 a week to operate out of here.
Four weeks, that's 1 200 bucks you owe.

06:05.400 --> 06:09.109
You come across Canal Street and
start throwing your weight around here?

06:09.240 --> 06:12.789
You Chink scumbag, you'll end up
with a wire around your fuckin' neck.

06:12.920 --> 06:16.230
Now get outta here before
l kick your ass. Hey, kid.

06:49.600 --> 06:54.230
The rumour is, Jackie Wong was more
than the unofficial mayor of Chinatown,

06:54.360 --> 06:56.999
that he was also
the head of a secret Triad.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.510
Jackie Wong, no question, will be missed.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.473
He was loved.
He made money for his people.

07:03.600 --> 07:07.354
But the head of a secret Triad?
There's no Triads in New York.

07:07.480 --> 07:12.759
I'm sure, Captain, you've heard rumours
that Wong's successor, Harry Yung,

07:12.880 --> 07:15.030
was a corrupt Hong Kong policeman

07:15.160 --> 07:17.674
who came here with $1 5 million.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.712
$1 5 million? That's a good one.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.958
Somebody should tell Harry Yung that.
I have no further comments at this time.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.559
Do you have that? OK.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.478
You're a hell of a reporter, honey.

07:31.600 --> 07:35.878
Except you're talkin' to a guy with a bag
on his head and cotton in his ears.

07:36.720 --> 07:40.156
- Stick around, you may learn something.
- Who are you?

07:41.160 --> 07:43.355
Just ask for Stanley White.

07:43.560 --> 07:47.314
- Which Stanley White?
- There's only one Stanley White.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.876
Hello, Will. How's the view up there?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.389
You can see a long way.

07:54.520 --> 07:57.159
Still believe in keeping
a high police profile?

07:57.280 --> 07:59.396
If you wore your uniform once in a while,

07:59.520 --> 08:03.229
you'd know that police visibility's
the strongest deterrent to crime.

08:03.360 --> 08:07.148
It doesn't look like you're deterring
too much around here lately.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.555
Aren't you in the wrong precinct, Captain?

08:09.680 --> 08:11.989
Not really. They gave
me a new command.

08:12.120 --> 08:14.111
Yeah? What'd they give you?

08:14.920 --> 08:16.478
Chinatown.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.919
That's right, Will.
They just cut off your oats.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.557
Why?

08:26.680 --> 08:28.910
Because of this?

08:29.040 --> 08:31.554
How was l supposed to prevent this?

08:31.680 --> 08:35.308
How am l supposed
to prevent anything around here?

08:36.360 --> 08:39.272
- Come on, l'll buy you a cup of coffee.
- (beeping)

08:39.400 --> 08:42.073
Ah, what the hell?

08:44.400 --> 08:47.358
Like l told you before, man... no pictures!

08:53.080 --> 08:56.311
John... go to her.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.398
Right there. Get Laura Wong.
Get the close-up. Come on.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.990
- That's the daughter.
- You people...

09:02.120 --> 09:03.951
Hey! Don't touch the camera!

09:04.080 --> 09:06.275
(in Chinese) Get rid of the camera!

09:06.440 --> 09:09.637
The camera is none
of your business! Go away!

09:11.120 --> 09:14.669
(in English) Enough! What'd l tell you
before? Get on outta here.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.554
He's over there in the back.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.593
(reporter) Tell me when, OK?
Tell me when.

10:12.480 --> 10:15.472
And so, with the passing
of Dai Jackie Wong,

10:15.600 --> 10:18.876
a piece of Chinatown history
passes with him.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.551
This is Tracy Tzu, WKXT News,
Mott Street, Chinatown.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.795
What are you assholes
doin' around here, huh?

10:35.840 --> 10:38.479
(girl) Get off, you fuckin' bastard! Get off!

10:38.600 --> 10:41.194
You can't come down here, man.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.276
(men shouting in Chinese)

10:53.080 --> 10:55.514
It's no raid.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.995
Keep on playin'. No problem.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.396
Lookin' for uncle Harry.

11:05.000 --> 11:05.955
uncle Harry?

11:06.080 --> 11:08.958
(in Chinese) Not here, white devil, get out!

11:10.000 --> 11:11.399
Where's Harry?

11:11.520 --> 11:13.670
(in Chinese) Not here, white man.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.959
Hey, he's going to be back soon.

11:18.520 --> 11:21.114
(in English) You tell Harry l'm comin' over.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.959
(in Chinese) Get out!

11:24.080 --> 11:26.036
Let's play!

11:32.840 --> 11:35.070
How could you have let the white devil in?

11:35.240 --> 11:36.434
What the...

11:36.600 --> 11:39.114
What's going on with you?

11:39.440 --> 11:42.637
I'm lookin' for uncle Harry.
Where's Harry Yung?

11:43.640 --> 11:45.596
- Where are you going?
- Harry in there?

11:45.720 --> 11:47.472
Where are you going?

11:47.600 --> 11:49.875
- Wait.
- Thought we should have a talk,

11:50.000 --> 11:52.753
seein' we're both new at our jobs.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.753
Why did you go to
the gambling place, huh?

11:58.080 --> 12:02.392
We had the same arrangement
over long period of time.

12:02.520 --> 12:05.910
No policeman ever go to gambling club!

12:06.040 --> 12:08.634
Foolish man! Rude...

12:09.640 --> 12:12.074
I'm going to have to tell your superiors.

12:12.200 --> 12:15.272
It won't be the first time, uncle Harry.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.836
I'm glad you guys are here.
Saves me some lung power.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.520
This is it. I'll give it to you fast.

12:21.640 --> 12:24.313
There's a new marshal in town.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.112
Me.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.879
New marshal means new rules.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.549
New rules means no more street violence.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.114
You collar the gangs.

12:35.240 --> 12:39.597
I don't wanna see their fucking faces
unless they're bringin' me spareribs.

12:39.720 --> 12:43.395
I don't care what you do.
Get 'em jobs catchin' cockroaches.

12:43.640 --> 12:47.428
- But you get 'em off the streets.
- Nobody can control the gangs!

12:47.560 --> 12:50.597
Everybody knows that.
Too big a problem.

12:50.720 --> 12:55.157
Captain, Chinatown
behind you all the way.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.271
In favour of what you do.

12:57.400 --> 13:01.837
You take gang kid in the alley.
You put bag over their head.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.430
You beat them with club.

13:04.560 --> 13:07.358
Chinatown behind you 100 per cent.

13:07.480 --> 13:10.278
- 100 per cent!
- 100 per cent behind...

13:10.400 --> 13:13.710
Good. Cos l'm gonna need your help.

13:13.920 --> 13:18.198
I wanna put a stop to all this bribe-paying
and extortion to the gangs.

13:18.320 --> 13:21.596
- I want the help of all 60 families.
- 60 families?

13:21.720 --> 13:22.869
No, no, no, no, no.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.673
- And l want you people...
- Wait a minute.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.519
This very difficult. Very, very difficult.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.036
It's a long history.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.197
For thousands of years,
Chinese do not go to the police.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.832
If they go to the police,
they'll get in trouble.

13:37.960 --> 13:41.032
So, l'll tell you straight.

13:41.160 --> 13:44.118
- Nobody will come to see you.
- Oh, yeah?

13:44.240 --> 13:47.038
(in Chinese) You tell him what we mean.

13:48.080 --> 13:52.119
(in English) No disrespect is intended
to the police by our remarks.

13:52.240 --> 13:57.360
But if the citizens of Chinatown regard
what you call extortion and bribery

13:57.480 --> 14:02.713
as part of the cost of doing business, and
have felt that way for thousands of years,

14:03.400 --> 14:06.278
why should you be so concerned?

14:06.400 --> 14:08.834
What about the ones
that don't wanna pay?

14:08.960 --> 14:09.949
(in Chinese) Tell him.

14:10.080 --> 14:13.277
(in English) You know, Captain,
when l first came to New York,

14:13.400 --> 14:16.119
I worked as a waiter in a restaurant.

14:16.240 --> 14:20.119
Saw something terrible happen
because my boss did not want to pay.

14:20.600 --> 14:24.195
I signed a complaint against
a gang leader who was arrested.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.914
Next day, he was out on the streets again.

14:27.040 --> 14:32.717
Six months go by before his trial, and the
police chief was transferred to the Bronx.

14:32.840 --> 14:36.594
This was - what? - six...
six or seven chiefs before McKenna.

14:36.720 --> 14:37.789
Seven.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.230
And the new chief dropped the charges.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.238
- Three months later l got stabbed here.
- Sure. See?

14:45.760 --> 14:47.876
You must understand, Captain,

14:48.000 --> 14:51.515
to us, your Good Samaritan was a fool

14:51.640 --> 14:55.349
to risk the security of
his family to help a stranger.

14:55.480 --> 14:58.597
uh, you're too impressed with yourself.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.879
Fuck you.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.434
What did you say?

15:04.560 --> 15:07.028
I said "Fuck you."

15:07.160 --> 15:10.311
I'm tired of all this
"Chinese this", "Chinese that".

15:11.080 --> 15:15.631
You people, you think gambling,
extortion, corruption are kosher

15:15.760 --> 15:18.035
because it's a thousand years old?

15:18.160 --> 15:22.312
Well, all this "thousand-year-old" stuff,
it's a lot of shit to me.

15:22.440 --> 15:27.594
This is America, and it's 200 years old,
so you'd better get your clocks fixed.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.280
You're not special,
and you're not beyond the law -

15:30.400 --> 15:33.437
any more than the Puerto Ricans
or the Polacks.

15:36.800 --> 15:40.236
So we're all gonna obey the law
the way it says.

15:40.840 --> 15:46.437
So start doing something about it,
and fast, or you're all gonna suffer.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.274
You can believe that.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.199
(door closes)

16:00.320 --> 16:02.276
(all argue in Chinese)

16:03.440 --> 16:05.590
(in Chinese) How will we deal with this?

16:06.720 --> 16:08.392
(man) Morning, Stan.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.398
- (man) Morning, Stan.
- (both) Hi, Stan.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.954
- (man) Hi, Stan.
- Morning, Stan.

16:15.120 --> 16:18.032
- He's early.
- He's always early.

16:18.160 --> 16:21.948
- I got a complaint about you already.
- There's a line around the block.

16:22.080 --> 16:27.029
A Harry Yung was upset you bust into his
place of business on a day of mourning.

16:27.160 --> 16:30.550
He says you're threatening
the arrangement we've always had.

16:30.680 --> 16:35.276
What is this arrangement? ls it carved in
stone? Did it come out of a burning bush?

16:35.400 --> 16:37.675
What the hell did you rush in there for?

16:37.800 --> 16:40.758
You made them lose face,
you made us lose face.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.633
You got no respect?
They were just having breakfast.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.149
What evidence did
you have to go in there?

16:46.280 --> 16:49.158
With these people,
you're not gonna have any evidence.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.032
You're talking shit.

16:51.160 --> 16:53.720
I didn't buy this job at Macy's.
You gave it to me.

16:53.840 --> 16:57.549
And l told you to kick ass on
the youth gangs, not the old guys.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.194
You lay off them, you hear?

17:00.320 --> 17:04.313
Fifth Precinct's a nice quiet area, Stanley.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.159
Good springboard for promotion,
if you get my meaning.

17:07.280 --> 17:09.714
Lou, l've been down there
one goddamn day.

17:09.839 --> 17:13.833
Doesn't take a genius to figure out
something's going on.

17:13.960 --> 17:18.112
There's gonna be blood in the gutters.
These Chinese will muscle across Canal.

17:18.240 --> 17:22.153
They're gonna push the Mafia out. I'm
talking banks, real estate, drug money.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.316
Who told you all this? The DEA?

17:24.440 --> 17:28.319
They've been peddling that bullshit
Chinese Mafia theory for years,

17:28.440 --> 17:31.512
and they never made a case
in Chinatown. I wouldn't believe...

17:31.640 --> 17:33.790
You don't know what you're talkin' about.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.117
The Mafia concept's not
even ltalian, it's Chinese.

17:37.240 --> 17:41.153
- It's Chinese.
- It was invented in China 1 ,000 years ago.

17:41.280 --> 17:43.794
- They call 'em Triads.
- Triads.

17:43.920 --> 17:47.390
That's what we have here -
the offshoots of the Hong Kong Triads.

17:47.520 --> 17:50.034
Stanley, you're letting your imagination...

17:50.160 --> 17:52.151
No. Lou, like hell l am.

17:52.280 --> 17:56.398
These people are the biggest overall
importers of heroin in this country.

17:56.520 --> 18:01.230
The fact that we don't have a single bust
against one of them tells me somethin'.

18:01.360 --> 18:05.353
They're smart. They're smarter than
you are, and Kearney, this lrish sphinx.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.233
At least l didn't change
my name, Wizynski.

18:10.560 --> 18:13.028
What do you want?

18:13.160 --> 18:16.152
You wanna attack Chinatown
with the 82nd Airborne?

18:17.840 --> 18:20.673
You're not in Vietnam here, Stanley.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.875
There, l never saw the goddamn enemy.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.958
Here, they're in front of my eyes.
They got no place to hide.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.640
This is just like
the South Bronx and Red Hook.

18:29.760 --> 18:33.275
You got a bunch of delinquents,
youth gangs... Call 'em what you want.

18:33.400 --> 18:37.996
Snot-nosed Chink scumbags. Go and kick
their asses. That's what you're good at.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.475
Youth gangs? These are midget hit men.

18:40.600 --> 18:44.991
You know what your problem is? You
work like a piece of heavy machinery.

18:45.120 --> 18:49.796
Nobody likes you, Stanley. They tell you
you're a great cop, but they don't like you.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.116
So what?

18:54.080 --> 18:56.640
Just put my request through, will you?

18:56.760 --> 18:59.672
Kearney, pleasure talking to you -
it's like one hand clapping.

18:59.800 --> 19:02.712
All of a sudden, this job's
made you an expert?!

19:04.440 --> 19:06.032
He's got a thing for Chinks.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.113
(conversation in Polish)

19:38.320 --> 19:40.276
Yoo-hoo! Connie!

19:41.040 --> 19:43.474
- I'm home.
- (Connie) ln here!

19:43.600 --> 19:47.957
Where you been? l've been calling for
two days. You don't answer the phone?

19:51.520 --> 19:54.318
Connie, what the hell's goin' on here?

19:54.440 --> 19:55.873
Don't ask.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.470
It's the washing machine again.
And while l was at it, l fixed the sink.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.113
Jesus!

20:01.240 --> 20:04.232
Connie, why don't you
ever call the repairman?

20:04.360 --> 20:07.477
You're livin' in the past, Stanley.
You find one.

20:08.920 --> 20:11.309
Hey, look at this mess.

20:11.440 --> 20:15.353
Buy me a new machine!
But don't break my balls, Stanley.

20:16.280 --> 20:19.829
Been trying to fix this thing
for three hours, and l'm not in the mood.

20:19.960 --> 20:22.713
- I didn't say anything.
- Yeah, but you were gonna.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.071
- I can always tell when you're in a mood.
- What's wrong with you?

20:26.200 --> 20:29.670
I walk in the door,
you don't even say hello.

20:29.800 --> 20:34.351
You don't smile. All you do is, you say,
"Stanley, don't break my balls."

20:34.480 --> 20:38.951
- What kind of a relationship is this?
- You don't care about our relationship.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.276
I do care.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.594
I do care about our relationship.

20:45.360 --> 20:49.353
- Come on!
- I just wanna know why you're so angry.

20:49.480 --> 20:53.871
Well, Stanley, it's because you have
become an arrogant, self-centred,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.753
condescending son of a bitch.

20:58.000 --> 21:02.676
- Well, there's a lot to be arrogant about.
- Oh, don't start, OK?

21:02.800 --> 21:05.394
I'm not takin' any more of your shit, Stan.

21:06.440 --> 21:10.433
You want to fix the fuckin' washing
machine? You go ahead and fix it.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.510
Oh, Jesus.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.758
You fix it. I gotta go to work.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.558
Hey, l'm not having such
a great day either, you know.

21:21.680 --> 21:26.151
I thought you said you had the night off.
I thought maybe we could go out.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.555
They shifted me back to nights.

21:28.680 --> 21:32.878
What is biting your ass?
Don't tell me it's the washing machine.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.433
No.

21:34.560 --> 21:38.519
Nothin'. Because l don't expect
anything from you any more, Stanley.

21:38.640 --> 21:42.838
- What is that supposed to mean?
- It means you bombed out.

21:42.960 --> 21:46.270
You forgot. You weren't here.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.675
You missed target practice.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.394
- What?
- Wednesday.

21:51.520 --> 21:53.875
Wednesday!

21:54.000 --> 21:56.434
It's the day of my ovulation.

22:00.880 --> 22:03.314
I guess l forgot.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.318
Don't bullshit me, Stan. I don't like it.

22:06.440 --> 22:10.115
I'm getting the picture, OK?
lt's clear as ice.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.958
- If you really wanted a kid...
- Of course l want a kid.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.036
No. No.

22:16.960 --> 22:21.397
You'd take care of yourself a bit.
You'd sleep decent hours.

22:21.520 --> 22:25.229
You'd eat regular.
You'd take your vitamins.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.113
You promised me
you'd take your vitamin E.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.155
I paid 50 bucks for this.

22:31.280 --> 22:34.397
And you'd screw me once
in a while at the right time of month.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.512
- How the hell do we stand a chance?
- Hey, l'm sorry.

22:37.760 --> 22:41.435
I know you're sorry. You said that
last month and the month before that.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.870
I'll tell you what. Next month
we'll take a weekend off.

22:45.760 --> 22:50.914
We'll go up to that place in the Poconos,
that place your brother-in-law talks about.

22:51.520 --> 22:55.798
You know, the place with the
heart-shaped tubs? We could try there.

22:55.920 --> 22:59.037
Don't give me all that.
Don't treat me like an idiot.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.835
It doesn't work any more.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.276
It doesn't work.

23:34.240 --> 23:34.831
Shit!

23:46.040 --> 23:52.388
(in Chinese) # So sweet,
your smile is so sweet

23:52.560 --> 23:57.680
# Like a flower blossoming

23:57.840 --> 24:02.960
# ln the warm spring breeze

24:03.640 --> 24:06.837
# Where was it

24:07.000 --> 24:10.913
# Where was it
that l had seen you before?

24:11.080 --> 24:15.676
# Your smile is so familiar

24:15.840 --> 24:21.631
# l can't remember

24:21.800 --> 24:26.954
# ln my dreams

24:31.000 --> 24:33.468
I didn't think you'd show up.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.797
I guess l had to get a closer look
at the jerk who insulted me.

24:36.920 --> 24:39.480
- What would you like to drink?
- Tea.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.273
- Why didn't you say who you were?
- Hostile, aren't you?

24:42.400 --> 24:44.391
I showed up, didn't l?

24:44.520 --> 24:47.080
Why don't you have some spareribs?

24:47.200 --> 24:50.954
They have great spareribs, but lousy
lighting. Ever wonder about that?

24:51.080 --> 24:55.631
Why a Chinese restaurant makes you feel
like you're inside a motor vehicle bureau?

24:55.760 --> 25:00.072
- Feel like l'm waiting for an eye test.
- Well, the atmosphere is not the thing.

25:00.200 --> 25:03.272
Besides, l like ltalian food better anyway.

25:05.720 --> 25:08.632
I'm impressed.
Are you doing your homework?

25:09.600 --> 25:12.956
I'm scratching the surface.
So you're from Hong Kong?

25:13.080 --> 25:15.435
No. American born.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.994
San Francisco, the Bay area.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.189
How many generations
have your people been here?

25:21.320 --> 25:25.552
My great-grandfather came,
worked in the railroads, went back.

25:25.680 --> 25:30.071
My grandfather worked in a gold mine.
He also went back.

25:30.200 --> 25:33.715
They went back because the law
wouldn't allow their wives to come over.

25:33.840 --> 25:37.230
My father married a Japanese woman
and settled here in the '40s.

25:37.360 --> 25:40.636
Yeah, l know the story.
It's a pretty sad one.

25:40.760 --> 25:44.958
Thousands of you Chinese came over
here, and you died building the railroads.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.798
It says so here.

25:46.920 --> 25:51.516
Their bones are scattered all over the
West. We don't even know their names.

25:51.640 --> 25:56.156
There's a photograph here.
Promontory Point, utah. 1869.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.637
It's where the union
and Central Pacific first met.

25:59.760 --> 26:02.149
Take a look at it. What do you see?

26:02.280 --> 26:05.113
What do you see?
You see the bosses.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.959
You see the politicians.
You see the bankers.

26:08.080 --> 26:12.551
You see the lrish workmen.
There's not one single, solitary Chinaman.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.990
They weren't even asked to show up.
They died anonymous.

26:16.120 --> 26:19.192
You goddamn people,
you keep everything a secret.

26:19.320 --> 26:22.232
- I know the story, Captain.
- Well, most people don't.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.590
No one remembers in this country.

26:24.720 --> 26:28.395
- No one remembers anything.
- You sound just like my father.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.273
He sounds like a great guy.
What does he do?

26:31.400 --> 26:33.914
He's in shipping. Now, what's your story?

26:34.040 --> 26:36.679
Me? What's there to say?

26:36.800 --> 26:38.392
uh...

26:38.640 --> 26:41.313
I'm Polish. I'm from Brooklyn. I'm a cop.

26:41.640 --> 26:45.349
But l happen to be the most decorated
cop in the City of New York.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.711
I'm talking action decorated,
no desk citations here.

26:48.840 --> 26:52.549
- I'm sure about that.
- I saw you a few times on the tube.

26:52.680 --> 26:56.639
I don't watch much television,
but l think you're pretty good.

26:56.760 --> 26:59.558
You're sexier than the broads
on the other channels.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.877
Ah, well, Captain.
Very pleased you've come.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.389
- Hello.
- uncle Yung, you know Tracy Tzu?

27:05.520 --> 27:09.752
Oh, yes. Very pleased you've come.
This is my wife Su Shin.

27:09.880 --> 27:13.316
Captain, do you like Chinese
champagne? This is very good.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.396
This is on the house.

27:15.520 --> 27:18.956
Thanks, Harry, but no thanks.
I pay my own way.

27:19.080 --> 27:23.073
- Fish stinks from the head, does it not?
- The Chinese eat the head, Captain.

27:23.840 --> 27:24.955
Enjoy.

27:25.080 --> 27:26.354
(in Chinese) Let's go.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.152
It looks like champagne...

27:28.280 --> 27:31.795
- I think you upset him.
- I certainly hope so.

27:46.240 --> 27:49.073
(in Chinese) # l've been waiting
for over a year

27:49.200 --> 27:51.077
Look at it this way.

27:51.200 --> 27:55.352
Harry Yung, he's the head of
the richest tong in Chinatown.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.948
He's gotta be involved
in the Chinese Mafia.

27:58.080 --> 28:01.550
Even if he isn't doin' anything,
he's gotta be doin' something.

28:01.680 --> 28:06.037
And if l can nail the son of a bitch,
and he's got face, l get face.

28:06.160 --> 28:09.391
And if l get face, l can
win the war in Chinatown.

28:09.520 --> 28:12.956
Captain, why did you call me?
What do you want?

28:14.760 --> 28:16.876
I'll tell you what l want.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.037
I want the rice to boil over in Chinatown.

28:20.520 --> 28:22.875
I wanna change things.

28:23.560 --> 28:26.028
Why? ls Chinatown so bad the way it is?

28:26.160 --> 28:29.835
It stinks. The Harry Yungs
got this place locked up like a jail.

28:29.960 --> 28:34.431
You got a slave population of sweatshop
women working for 1 2 cents a piece.

28:34.560 --> 28:37.870
You got shopkeepers paying bribes
to every punk that comes along.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.753
You got 30 people livin' in a room.

28:40.880 --> 28:46.398
You got the highest rate of TB and
mental illness in any city neighbourhood.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.357
- You got a male population...
- Look, l'm a reporter.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.994
I am not a crusader.

28:56.680 --> 28:59.478
You're an actress. I can help you.

29:00.280 --> 29:03.670
- How?
- I'll give you hard facts off the record.

29:03.800 --> 29:08.316
You do an exposé on Chinatown. One
week you do the gambling connection.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.352
The next week you do
the youth gang extortion racket.

29:11.480 --> 29:14.870
You move up the ladder,
to the bosses that own the places.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.630
You splash their faces on the tube, take
a little journalistic licence, you know?

29:19.760 --> 29:22.513
Each week we peel
another layer off the onion.

29:22.640 --> 29:27.236
If it was a white broad, they'd say it's
racist, but with you, it's on the up and up.

29:27.360 --> 29:31.319
This is outrageous. There are
boundaries, Captain White. Ethics!

29:31.440 --> 29:34.796
The press is independent.
It's not just another undercover cop.

29:34.920 --> 29:38.230
What you're asking for is absurd.
It's almost criminal.

29:38.360 --> 29:42.239
You wouldn't know a real criminal if one
popped out the toilet and bit your ass.

29:42.360 --> 29:45.557
I don't think there's any
point in going on with this.

29:45.680 --> 29:49.275
You sit down, you get smart,
and you listen to me.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.952
Go fuck yourself.

29:58.280 --> 30:00.555
(screaming)

31:25.200 --> 31:27.475
(Yung) Didn't see nothing, man.

31:27.600 --> 31:31.479
Two men, ski masks, ran up the stairs.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.558
Boom, boom. Was all over.

31:39.240 --> 31:42.038
It's all right. It's all right. It's all over now.

31:42.600 --> 31:44.556
It's all right.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.994
Stop crying. Stop crying.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.273
(in Chinese) Now you see
what l'm saying.

31:59.440 --> 32:02.238
You've seen what happens.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.277
Who did this? Why?

32:04.440 --> 32:08.274
Who were those kids?

32:08.440 --> 32:10.476
Could they have been
with the Nam Soong?

32:10.640 --> 32:12.073
No. No, it's not them.

32:12.240 --> 32:15.676
It's someone from the inside.
It can't be the Nam Soong.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.513
What would the Nam Soong gain
by messing with us? Nothing.

32:18.680 --> 32:20.477
They couldn't take over our place.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.273
Recently there's
the Double Flower business.

32:23.440 --> 32:26.716
It's not the Double Flower,
it's the other guy.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.393
The other guy!

32:28.560 --> 32:31.120
uncle Hung!
All this is done by the Nam Soong gang.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.794
Don't question it.
They came from Toronto.

32:33.960 --> 32:34.949
How do you know?

32:35.120 --> 32:37.680
I saw them two days ago.
Now they've gone back.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.638
We'll find them.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.792
- You take care of it, then.
- Yes.

32:44.800 --> 32:48.759
I'm going to ask you again.
Do Nam Soong have their reasons?

32:48.920 --> 32:50.956
It's because of the police, uncle.

32:51.120 --> 32:54.556
They want to get their hands
on our goods, so they mess with us.

32:54.680 --> 32:58.468
The guys in Hong Kong and Amsterdam
know what Nam Soong is capable of.

32:58.640 --> 33:01.393
We seem to be no match for him.

33:01.560 --> 33:04.074
The shootout at the restaurant,
other things...

33:04.240 --> 33:06.629
Everyone says they're
trying to start a war.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.438
But what l'm afraid of most

33:08.600 --> 33:11.194
is that they seem to be
targeting you directly.

33:11.360 --> 33:14.193
If we don't fight back,
we'll lose everything.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.079
What you're saying makes some sense.

33:17.880 --> 33:23.432
In our business, we can't succeed
unless the market is stable.

33:23.880 --> 33:27.156
The market is very unstable.
The shootout was six months ago.

33:27.320 --> 33:30.232
The restaurant has only made
70% of its usual profits since.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.356
And the ltalians are still angry at us

33:32.520 --> 33:35.478
about what happened
with the candy store.

33:35.600 --> 33:38.160
Fuck them! How long
have they worked with us?

33:38.320 --> 33:40.754
And still they treat us like this!

33:40.880 --> 33:42.871
They call us "yellow niggers".

33:43.520 --> 33:44.555
Right?

33:44.680 --> 33:48.389
(in English) Our banking and
shipping profits are all down.

33:48.520 --> 33:51.512
Gold prices are slumping.
Our stocks are sluggish.

33:51.640 --> 33:53.870
Our commodities position has slipped.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.117
There's no new money
coming in, gentlemen.

33:58.040 --> 34:02.511
The Vietnamese will start competing
with our gambling profits.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.108
And this new policeman,

34:05.240 --> 34:09.199
making rude noises about
Chinatown and justice, and all...

34:10.120 --> 34:16.309
(in Chinese) l have much respect for
each and every one of you, uncles.

34:17.360 --> 34:21.114
But l believe that right now
we need a strong leader.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.790
Speaking of me...

34:30.320 --> 34:32.993
OK, Joey.

34:33.159 --> 34:35.196
I'll let you keep on talking.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.909
You guys talk about it.

34:47.520 --> 34:52.196
Joey, what you're saying
about our business is true.

34:52.360 --> 34:58.037
If we let you lead us, what will you do?

34:58.200 --> 35:03.035
First of all, when my uncle leaves
his post, l will make him look good.

35:03.800 --> 35:04.676
Right?

35:04.840 --> 35:09.868
Second of all, l will find out
who did this to our restaurant.

35:10.040 --> 35:14.556
I will have to go to Thailand and put up a
good fight with Ban Sung for our goods.

35:15.360 --> 35:18.238
(in English) Then there is
the matter with the ltalians.

35:18.360 --> 35:22.239
It is perhaps time to consider
ending the old arrangement with them.

35:22.360 --> 35:26.035
Do like they do! Sell directly
to the blacks and Puerto Ricans.

35:26.160 --> 35:28.628
(in Chinese) We can make
more money that way.

35:28.800 --> 35:31.519
Right, uncle Bin, let's not waste time.

35:31.680 --> 35:34.433
We'll just do it ourselves, right?

35:36.040 --> 35:38.270
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Chief.

35:39.520 --> 35:41.476
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Frank.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.990
- Morning, Commissioner.
- Morning, Commissioner.

35:54.120 --> 35:58.557
Anything to tell me on the Wild West
show at the Shanghai Palace last night?

35:59.840 --> 36:01.796
Yes, sir.

36:01.920 --> 36:06.118
Our information is that it was an East
Broadway gang. We're checking on it.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.435
I wouldn't bet on that information, sir.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.630
You know something we don't know?

36:10.760 --> 36:15.356
No, sir. It's just that our street information
in Chinatown hasn't been right so far.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.835
We're the last ones
to know what's goin' on there.

36:17.960 --> 36:22.954
The important thing is that both punks
were hit, and it'll be hard for them to hide.

36:23.080 --> 36:27.870
And if l can get to them, and l will,
then l got one hand on their balls.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.798
Captain White is speaking for himself, sir.

36:30.920 --> 36:33.309
I don't care who he's speaking for.

36:33.440 --> 36:38.560
I know this. These punks are whacking
out people left and right. Tourists!

36:38.680 --> 36:43.196
I just got my ass chewed out by
the mayor, who is mighty pissed off.

36:43.320 --> 36:47.552
And so am l. What the hell has happened
to Chinatown? lt was never like this.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.557
(Stanley) The causes of this run deep.

36:49.680 --> 36:53.639
Be that as it may, l want this crap
stopped, and l want it stopped now!

36:53.840 --> 36:57.879
Or heads are going to roll. Am l
making myself clear to you people?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.115
Yes, boss.

36:59.240 --> 37:02.198
You want some fast results
and no bullshit.

37:02.320 --> 37:06.871
Let me have one Chinese undercover
cop and l'll penetrate these fuckers.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.513
What are you talking about?

37:08.640 --> 37:10.756
Have you asked your
commanding officer?

37:10.880 --> 37:12.836
Yes, sir, and it was ignored.

37:12.960 --> 37:17.636
As was my warning that the gutters
were gonna run red with blood.

37:19.360 --> 37:22.636
The request is under
consideration, Commissioner.

37:22.760 --> 37:25.194
This kid he wants is a trainee.

37:25.320 --> 37:28.835
- He's already got six Chinese cops.
- I got six too many.

37:28.960 --> 37:32.953
I got six Chinese cops down there
no one talks to. They treat 'em like lepers.

37:33.080 --> 37:37.073
This kid, Herbert Kwong, he's from China,
and no one knows him down there.

37:37.200 --> 37:41.113
And he don't know shit from Shinola.
He needs another 100 hours minimum.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.514
We don't have another 100 hours.

37:51.920 --> 37:54.354
Give him what he wants.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.038
Now.

37:56.160 --> 37:58.628
And get some results.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.032
That's it.

38:09.440 --> 38:12.398
Nobody does what
you did in here. Nobody.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.910
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.036
(loud rock music)

39:28.680 --> 39:29.749
(music off)

39:29.880 --> 39:33.350
(in Chinese) All you guys do
is eat and gamble.

39:34.400 --> 39:37.915
- I told you to keep this place clean.
- It is.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.196
It smells like a sewer.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.316
So what?

39:43.600 --> 39:45.875
- Where's the doctor?
- Inside.

39:47.200 --> 39:50.510
- Those two are OK now?
- You gave them the shots?

39:50.680 --> 39:51.795
Get up.

39:51.960 --> 39:54.679
- Hey, little brother, how are you doing?
- I'm OK.

39:54.840 --> 39:58.150
- Does your foot hurt very much?
- It's all right.

39:58.320 --> 40:00.550
- You got a shot, didn't you?
- Yes.

40:00.720 --> 40:04.030
- How's your brother's foot?
- Hey, get up. Tai is here.

40:04.200 --> 40:07.636
- Hey, how's your foot?
- It's OK.

40:07.800 --> 40:08.949
- Can you walk?
- Yes.

40:09.120 --> 40:11.714
- Give it a try.
- It's OK.

40:15.840 --> 40:19.150
Good boy, you've got balls.

40:21.480 --> 40:24.278
Both of you, get some rest.

40:24.440 --> 40:27.750
- I'm gonna take off.
- Thank you.

40:28.840 --> 40:30.796
Take care.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.993
How long before the wounds heal?

40:37.160 --> 40:40.596
Two weeks, maybe less.

40:40.760 --> 40:42.876
But the one with the toes...

40:43.040 --> 40:44.712
Thank you.

40:44.880 --> 40:51.353
Take care of this now.
Clean this place up.

40:52.640 --> 40:57.589
All of you, clean this place up!
lt stinks in here.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.796
(in English) See you.

41:22.920 --> 41:26.708
- (Stanley) How'd you get called Herbert?
- My Chinese name is too complicated.

41:26.840 --> 41:29.308
I looked in the phone book.
I found Herbert.

41:29.440 --> 41:33.194
Do you know anything about
Go Joey Tai? Harry Yung? Fred Hung?

41:33.480 --> 41:35.471
- uncle Milton Bin?
- No, sir.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.318
You're going to.

41:37.440 --> 41:41.149
Because you're gonna put 'em to sleep
at night, you're gonna wake 'em up.

41:41.280 --> 41:43.714
I wanna know where they go,
who they see.

41:43.840 --> 41:47.389
When you're not doing that, you're
gonna monitor a wiretap on them.

41:47.520 --> 41:50.796
Watch it, will you?
You drive worse than you shoot!

41:50.920 --> 41:53.718
- Stay out of the left lane.
- Yes, sir.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.990
uh, what hours am l working?

41:56.120 --> 41:59.351
Hours? Forget it. You're on
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

41:59.480 --> 42:02.278
- What about sleep?
- (cop) Forget sleep.

42:02.400 --> 42:05.836
- But l got a second job.
- Hey, Herbert, quit. I'm serious.

42:06.840 --> 42:10.515
- You want to be a cop or to fuck around?
- What's the point of the exercise?

42:10.640 --> 42:14.110
It's not an exercise. We're
dealing with the Chinese Mafia.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.549
They eat people like you for breakfast.

42:17.800 --> 42:20.758
Jesus! l told you,
stay out of the left lane.

42:20.880 --> 42:24.395
Did you ever notice this? Chinese
guys are always blockin' traffic.

42:24.520 --> 42:26.909
They drive like their music,
from right to left.

42:27.040 --> 42:29.235
(mutters in Chinese)

42:29.640 --> 42:32.791
Did you ever see a Chinese
Grand Prix driver? Huh?

42:32.920 --> 42:37.118
- (Stanley) No.
- Goddamn cab can't drive. Come on!

42:40.440 --> 42:45.639
(dispatcher) Central to 27 Adam Boy. Got
two male Asians shot dead at 6 Eldridge.

42:45.760 --> 42:49.036
They match the suspects in
the Shanghai Palace shooting.

42:49.160 --> 42:53.233
That's us. You're out. Outta the car.
You're undercover now. Get out!

42:57.400 --> 42:59.356
Where's White?

43:13.880 --> 43:16.758
Alan Perez, Captain.
Nobody, of course, saw nothing.

43:18.920 --> 43:22.674
Most of these people are illegal.
They're sweating a bust.

43:22.800 --> 43:27.191
The building and the farm are registered
to Tan Wan Lo. He lives in Hong Kong.

43:27.320 --> 43:30.949
We're checking it out, but he's
probably been dead for ten years.

43:31.080 --> 43:35.596
Building ownership down here makes
a Chinese fire drill look organised.

43:35.720 --> 43:38.473
- Where are they?
- Tony, get out here!

43:42.920 --> 43:45.673
This is the guy that tipped us.
Calls himself Tony.

43:45.800 --> 43:48.109
Says he's been working here 40 years.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.754
You wanna show the Captain
what you showed me?

44:00.320 --> 44:02.515
(in Chinese) Come on!

44:02.640 --> 44:04.119
You people!

44:08.280 --> 44:10.350
You can take off your shoes.

44:13.280 --> 44:15.316
Right here. Go look.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.356
Get a flashlight.

44:32.120 --> 44:36.796
You're a good man, Tony.
Not too many of you left.

44:36.920 --> 44:39.559
I know. You don't have to tell me. I know!

44:40.400 --> 44:43.358
All good men gone - Iong time.

44:43.920 --> 44:48.118
Everything change.
Young people, no respect.

44:48.240 --> 44:50.834
Steal, shoot, kill. Like white man.

44:52.160 --> 44:54.674
Chinese man is not afraid to work hard.

44:54.800 --> 44:56.950
I work 40 years here.

44:57.080 --> 44:59.469
I put every dollar in
Chase Manhattan Bank.

45:00.560 --> 45:03.199
Young people have no respect no more.

45:03.320 --> 45:05.834
Old men afraid. Not me.

45:06.840 --> 45:08.478
Not me.

45:08.600 --> 45:11.353
I been here long time.

45:11.480 --> 45:16.600
I have seen many things. I see things
lot of people don't even think l see.

45:17.680 --> 45:20.194
Tony, there should be more men like you.

45:20.320 --> 45:22.276
Bullshit!

45:24.160 --> 45:27.197
(in Chinese) l have no money
and no husband.

45:27.360 --> 45:31.876
All l want is to find her a college.

45:32.040 --> 45:36.556
But l can't find work,
so l can't support her education.

45:36.720 --> 45:40.474
(Joey) l understand your situation.
You don't have to worry any more.

45:40.640 --> 45:44.474
I have talked to Tina about this fall...

45:44.640 --> 45:47.438
Please forgive me.
I had no one else to turn to.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.955
I understand. Don't worry any more.

45:50.120 --> 45:55.035
I've arranged for Tina
to attend Columbia this fall.

45:55.200 --> 45:56.758
Stop worrying, OK?

45:56.920 --> 45:59.115
Thank you.

45:59.280 --> 46:02.033
Tina, it was difficult for
your mother to come to me.

46:02.200 --> 46:04.998
You must show your appreciation
by studying hard.

46:05.160 --> 46:08.789
Then you can help your mother out
so she won't have to work so hard.

46:08.960 --> 46:09.836
You hear me?

46:10.240 --> 46:15.268
..some say an act of revenge linked to the
restaurant massacre, but no one knows.

46:15.400 --> 46:18.915
And in this once quiet,
tourist-oriented community,

46:19.040 --> 46:21.031
the tourists are beginning to stay away.

46:21.160 --> 46:24.914
And the people here are beginning
to ask the dismaying question:

46:25.040 --> 46:27.349
"What is happening to Chinatown?"

46:27.480 --> 46:30.313
This is Tracy Tzu,
Eldridge Street, Chinatown.

46:31.120 --> 46:32.599
Here he is.

46:32.720 --> 46:33.789
Captain White?

46:33.920 --> 46:38.198
Captain White, can you give us any idea
who and what's behind this violence?

46:38.320 --> 46:43.713
Who? What? A thousand years of
civilisation. That's who, that's what.

46:43.840 --> 46:47.594
You oughta know that. Now get
that goddamn thing outta my face.

46:47.720 --> 46:50.439
- What's the matter?
- You don't know, you don't know.

46:50.560 --> 46:53.632
You're acting like there's
something between us.

47:05.800 --> 47:08.360
(in Chinese) Auntie,
stop worrying. I have to go.

47:08.520 --> 47:11.193
Have something to eat.
Don't worry any more.

47:14.760 --> 47:16.830
(in English) Mr White! l'm glad you came.

47:16.960 --> 47:20.032
Joey, congratulations.
I hear Harry Yung's out and you're in.

47:20.160 --> 47:22.913
- Stuart, all right?
- Meet my favourite lady.

47:23.040 --> 47:26.237
Connie, this is Joey Tai.
He owns the place. My wife.

47:26.360 --> 47:29.397
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs White.
- Hi. How are you?

47:29.640 --> 47:33.713
I'm sorry l'm late. Somethin' came up.
Why don't we order some spareribs...

47:33.840 --> 47:36.195
I told you. I got a late shift tonight.

47:36.320 --> 47:39.835
- We can talk after dinner.
- No, it might disturb my digestion.

47:39.960 --> 47:41.678
You really are something.

47:41.800 --> 47:43.074
(in Chinese) Hurry up!

47:43.200 --> 47:45.998
Just come over here. Let's call it a truce.

47:46.120 --> 47:50.159
- How about good champagne, Joey?
- Sure. Mrs White? Come this way.

47:50.280 --> 47:54.796
(in Chinese) Harvey, get me
the best champagne in the house.

47:55.720 --> 47:58.234
(Joey) You have an eye
for beauty, Captain.

47:58.360 --> 48:00.749
Yeah. She's a real rock. She's the best.

48:01.680 --> 48:05.434
You must have heard, we dug up
those two midgets that hit Harry's place.

48:05.560 --> 48:08.518
- Found 'em in a soybean basement.
- No, l didn't.

48:11.560 --> 48:15.075
My guess is somebody
didn't want us to find 'em.

48:15.200 --> 48:18.112
You don't think it was the friends
of the boy who was killed?

48:18.240 --> 48:22.711
If you accept the surface of things,
Joey. Which most people do.

48:22.840 --> 48:26.310
Why the bodyguard? Does it
come with the new title, or what?

48:26.440 --> 48:29.512
Just a precaution.
There's been too much violence...

48:29.640 --> 48:32.200
I agree. What are you and l
gonna do about it?

48:32.320 --> 48:34.038
(in Chinese) How's it going?

48:34.160 --> 48:38.153
Are you enticing those to be conquered
in coming to the conqueror?

48:38.280 --> 48:40.919
You should try our exploding lobster.

48:41.040 --> 48:44.510
My chef does it better than anybody
in the world. I brought him from...

48:44.640 --> 48:47.074
Hey, what do you want, Joey? Spit it out.

48:48.160 --> 48:49.434
Cigarette?

48:49.560 --> 48:50.993
No.

48:59.800 --> 49:02.633
This is not the Bronx or Brooklyn.

49:02.760 --> 49:04.955
It's not even New York.

49:05.080 --> 49:09.198
It's Chinatown, White. It can be
very easy, or it can be very hard.

49:09.320 --> 49:11.880
Well, why don't you make it easy?

49:12.560 --> 49:15.074
I'll help you get some
of these renegade youths.

49:15.200 --> 49:18.715
Witnesses, evidence,
everything you need.

49:18.840 --> 49:23.470
You'll get headlines, your superiors
will relax, and everybody happy.

49:23.600 --> 49:28.515
And then you can stay in Chinatown,
no transfer, and we can do business.

49:28.640 --> 49:31.632
You understand what
l am saying to you, Mr White?

49:31.760 --> 49:35.878
Yeah. I get the punks.
What do you want in return?

49:36.960 --> 49:39.110
Nothing.

49:39.240 --> 49:41.515
Just work with us.

49:41.640 --> 49:45.110
Chinese people come here
to prosper and not to change things.

49:45.240 --> 49:50.268
You know, this cross-eyed conversation
we're having, Joey, gets me confused.

49:51.480 --> 49:54.836
See, l'm a stupid Polack. A peasant.

49:55.280 --> 50:00.149
- You gotta make things real clear to me.
- Sure. How clear do l make it?

50:00.280 --> 50:03.078
Oh, l don't know.

50:03.200 --> 50:05.156
I'm thinking.

50:06.320 --> 50:10.871
Would a contract with us for security
work after you retire be what you need?

50:12.160 --> 50:15.118
We got some late-night clubs
you could keep an eye on.

50:15.240 --> 50:17.674
Could mean 100,000 a year.

50:20.400 --> 50:23.358
And we could put it
anywhere in the world.

50:25.040 --> 50:27.235
I don't think 100,000's gonna be enough.

50:32.120 --> 50:34.873
OK. How much, then?

50:37.240 --> 50:41.870
I'll take the same amount that you'll
make off your next 50 keys of heroin.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.956
(chuckles)

50:55.240 --> 50:57.435
At last.

50:57.560 --> 51:00.791
The clouds part to show the true sky.

51:01.520 --> 51:05.274
You know, most drug dealers are
morons, Joey, but l gotta hand it to you,

51:05.400 --> 51:07.630
you're one silky son of a bitch.

51:07.760 --> 51:10.593
This the way you deal with the ltalians?

51:10.720 --> 51:13.678
This the way you moved out Harry Yung?

51:15.240 --> 51:17.629
How about your
father-in-law, Jackie Wong?

51:17.760 --> 51:22.197
You know, rumour has it it was your hand
that was on the knife that killed him.

51:22.920 --> 51:27.835
You're a smart guy, Go Joey,
but you made one mistake.

51:29.240 --> 51:31.196
I'm not ltalian.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.877
I'm a Polack.

51:36.400 --> 51:38.755
And l can't be bought.

51:41.720 --> 51:44.188
I'm gonna burn you down.

51:45.080 --> 51:47.196
I'm gonna drag you...

51:48.320 --> 51:51.596
and your dirty laundry out on the street.

51:52.720 --> 51:55.154
And l'm gonna humiliate you.

51:56.960 --> 51:59.315
You are very stupid.

52:00.240 --> 52:02.674
And you're not gonna last.

52:04.320 --> 52:07.073
I'll last long enough to piss on your grave.

52:34.240 --> 52:37.994
Connie, what's wrong with you?!
l was only 20 minutes late!

52:45.840 --> 52:48.274
What's the matter with you?

52:53.640 --> 52:55.073
(car horn)

52:55.200 --> 52:57.668
Hey, you're right. I thought it over.

52:57.800 --> 53:02.316
I tried very hard to suppress it, but l think
there's definitely something between us.

53:04.440 --> 53:08.558
- Get in the car. I'll drive you home.
- I'm not some gook hooker in Saigon.

53:08.680 --> 53:10.079
(speaks Vietnamese)

53:11.920 --> 53:15.310
- Does that work with all the girls?
- Comme ci, comme ça.

53:15.440 --> 53:19.718
Why don't you give me a break? lt's not
every day l get to meet a famous person.

53:19.840 --> 53:22.400
Listen, l got a legitimate story for you.

53:25.640 --> 53:28.279
Want some wine? White or red?

53:28.400 --> 53:30.038
Both.

53:30.160 --> 53:32.515
Wow, this is some place.

53:33.760 --> 53:36.479
Hey, listen, forget what
l said in the restaurant.

53:36.600 --> 53:39.558
I know you got your ethics.
I respect that.

53:41.320 --> 53:45.836
But listen, you know, you got a great
human interest story in Joey Tai.

53:45.960 --> 53:49.714
Kid from the slums of Kowloon
comes over here.

53:49.840 --> 53:52.195
Works his way up.

53:52.320 --> 53:54.993
Marries the boss's daughter.

53:55.120 --> 53:58.874
Maybe knocks off the boss.
Becomes the boss.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.993
I mean, that's the American dream.

54:03.120 --> 54:05.429
Why don't you shine a light
on the son of a bitch?

54:05.560 --> 54:07.949
What if he's involved in nothing?

54:08.080 --> 54:12.790
What if he's just a successful
businessman, like my father?

54:12.920 --> 54:17.357
The Chinese are always involved in
something, never involved in nothing.

54:18.640 --> 54:20.392
Remember that.

54:20.520 --> 54:22.954
You're really cracked, you know that?

54:23.680 --> 54:28.117
The first time l saw you, l knew
you were cracked. And a racist, too.

54:32.080 --> 54:34.071
Were you in Vietnam?

54:35.440 --> 54:37.795
- Yeah. Why?
- I knew it.

54:38.520 --> 54:40.192
It ruined you.

54:40.320 --> 54:43.073
First time l saw you, l hated your guts.

54:44.480 --> 54:47.438
I think l even hated you
before l ever met you.

54:49.680 --> 54:52.035
I hated you on TV.

54:53.240 --> 54:55.674
I hated you in Vietnam.

54:57.920 --> 55:01.993
You wanna know what's destroying
this country? lt's not booze.

55:02.120 --> 55:03.838
It's not drugs.

55:03.960 --> 55:06.474
It's TV. It's media.
It's people like you.

55:06.600 --> 55:08.352
Vampires.

55:09.840 --> 55:14.356
I hate the way that you make your living,
sticking microphones in people's faces.

55:14.480 --> 55:17.517
I hate the way you lie
every night at six o'clock.

55:17.640 --> 55:20.393
I hate the way you kill real feelings.

55:20.760 --> 55:25.754
I hate everything that you stand for.
Most of all, l hate rich kids.

55:25.880 --> 55:27.916
And l hate this place.

55:28.040 --> 55:30.838
So why do l wanna fuck you so bad?

55:31.280 --> 55:34.750
Maybe you're right. Maybe l got no ethics.

55:36.320 --> 55:38.390
I can't. Stop it.

55:38.520 --> 55:39.999
You can't?

55:40.120 --> 55:44.716
I just spent all afternoon here,
making love with my boyfriend. I can't.

55:51.240 --> 55:53.674
So why'd you invite me here?

55:54.680 --> 55:57.399
What year are you living in?

55:57.520 --> 56:00.318
We're not in the back seat
of some car at a drive-in.

56:00.440 --> 56:03.318
You don't have to get your money's worth.

56:03.440 --> 56:07.035
Well, so who is he?
What's his name? What, is he rich?

56:07.760 --> 56:12.595
You wanna know if he's Chinese, right?
That's what you wanna know, so ask it.

56:12.720 --> 56:15.109
That's the question.
Why don't you answer it?

56:15.240 --> 56:17.549
He's white, all right?

56:17.680 --> 56:20.911
He went to Princeton. His name's Roger.

56:21.040 --> 56:22.996
And he's a lawyer.

56:23.120 --> 56:25.190
Well, l hate lawyers.

56:25.320 --> 56:29.916
And l wouldn't wanna make love to
a woman who just screwed a lawyer.

56:30.040 --> 56:31.439
- What's he got, money?
- Yes.

56:31.560 --> 56:35.189
- Roger Pumpernickel the Third?
- And he's not a crackpot racist.

56:35.320 --> 56:37.993
- He's a gentleman.
- Oh, yeah?

56:38.120 --> 56:43.069
What does he do? He plays tennis and
golf and goes out sailing on a yacht?

56:43.760 --> 56:46.638
What's with all these machines?
What are you, at AT&T?

56:46.760 --> 56:50.036
You got everybody in town
jumping in and out of your bed?

56:50.160 --> 56:51.878
You're acting like a child.

56:52.000 --> 56:56.039
Well, "A great man is one who in
manhood still keeps the heart of a child."

56:58.320 --> 57:02.757
Why don't you go home?
l can see this was a big mistake.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.037
Yeah, it was a mistake.
It was a giant mistake.

57:10.560 --> 57:12.915
It was a giant mistake.

57:14.560 --> 57:18.519
I'm gonna go home to a woman
who at least acts like a woman.

57:19.320 --> 57:22.357
If this Roger's so great,
how come he didn't marry you?

57:22.480 --> 57:24.789
He didn't want a slant-eyed
Roger the Fourth?

57:24.920 --> 57:26.751
I don't know.

57:26.880 --> 57:30.316
We've never discussed it.
We just meet here to fuck.

57:50.560 --> 57:54.838
I want to arrest the gang members for
loitering, spitting in the gutter, anything.

57:54.960 --> 57:58.396
- What about their civil rights?
- Fuck their civil rights!

57:59.320 --> 58:02.278
I want the honchos
around here to go apeshit.

58:04.480 --> 58:08.439
I want to disrupt the entire
commerce of Chinatown.

58:10.240 --> 58:12.595
Do you understand me?

58:14.000 --> 58:15.956
I want chaos.

58:18.200 --> 58:22.352
You know, you people, you're
starting to look like the Chicago Cubs.

58:23.320 --> 58:25.276
I'm not kidding.

58:26.560 --> 58:28.994
You look like you already lost.

58:31.520 --> 58:35.638
The world has fucked you over,
so now you don't give a shit.

58:38.840 --> 58:41.559
I know. I've been there.

58:41.680 --> 58:45.116
I've been in the job 1 5 years.
I know all the stories.

58:46.640 --> 58:49.074
My heart has been broken 100 times.

58:50.400 --> 58:52.834
I've got scar tissue on my soul.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.434
But let me tell you something.

59:00.160 --> 59:02.230
I give a shit.

59:02.360 --> 59:04.794
I'm gonna make you people give a shit.

59:05.840 --> 59:08.274
I don't care what you think of me.

59:09.160 --> 59:11.993
You guys are gonna
go through the numbers on this one.

59:12.120 --> 59:14.395
Now that's it. Get outta here.

59:14.520 --> 59:16.875
Whoa! One last thing.

59:19.640 --> 59:24.111
The next cop... that l hear about...

59:24.840 --> 59:27.877
who's taking money... in this precinct,

59:28.400 --> 59:31.153
I'm gonna personally bust their mouth.

59:31.280 --> 59:33.635
Are there any questions?

59:35.760 --> 59:38.228
What if it's a woman?

59:38.360 --> 59:40.794
She better bend over.

59:41.320 --> 59:43.675
- Whoo!
- (laughter)

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.993
Mr Wong, do you think Joey Tai is
responsible for the death of your father?

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.311
I want my lawyer!

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:38.911
(Tracy) Captain Stanley White,
commander of the Fifth Precinct,

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:42.999
has declared war on Chinatown.
Today there were 43 gang arrests,

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:46.032
three gambling parlours raided,
six sweatshops busted.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:51.632
In an opening blow at the man they call
the godfather of Chinatown, Joey Tai,

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:54.877
White has padlocked his restaurant
on a health violation.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.994
A crackdown is in the works. Although
District Attorney Jane Katzman denies it,

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.998
a major drug conspiracy case
is rumoured to be pending

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:07.432
against various respected older members
of the Chinatown ruling elite.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:11.633
Mr Tai, can you tell us if there is
such a thing as the Chinese Mafia?

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.320
Sounds very exciting, like a comic book.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:18.355
The existence of Triads is documented
by the Drug Enforcement Agency.

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.074
Documentation without proof.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.399
This farce is evidence of the consistent
discrimination against Chinese.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.833
Mr Tai, are you saying there is no
criminal element in all of Chinatown?

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.678
Of course not.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:37.669
But why do you media people insist on
emphasising this Charlie Chan image?

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.109
Why not talk about
the chair in Chinese History

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.795
our association
has endowed at Yale university?

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.992
Or our $1 2 million fund
for our 10,000 members?

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.113
Our free meals for the aged
and the unemployed?

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:54.279
Free burial, things like that?
Positive things.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.598
Mr Tai, what is your comment on Jackie
Wong? Do you have any comment?

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.228
I'm really happy you're OK.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.796
My doctor would kill me
if he knew l was here.

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.753
They just took my voice box out.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.110
They keep taking things out.

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:28.676
I have nothing left, Fred, but my brain.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:34.270
My brain says l'd rather do business
with a smart thief

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.713
than an honest man who is stupid.

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.799
A stupid man is dangerous.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:46.040
Like a defective time bomb, you never
know when it's gonna go off on you.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.869
But a thief, you can
control what he steals.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.312
I think, Teddy, you are going
to find Joey a very smart young man.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.558
Not cautious, as Jackie
or Harry, but aggressive.

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.796
He wants power.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.869
All young men want power.
That's what it means to be young, Fred.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.915
I wanna see his face, his eyes.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:16.433
I wanna know if he's reckless.
One look in his eyes, l will know.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.235
Bring him in, but leave the nigger outside.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.756
(camera clicks)

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.553
- (Joey) My esteemed friends...
- How's the sound?

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.955
A little background noise, but it's not bad.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.230
(Joey) The point, Mr Tedesco,

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:37.070
is that we are happy to let you continue
the distribution ofour software.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:43.152
But, with a 50 per cent reduction
in volume, and at a reduced fee.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.439
Something like 17 or 18 per cent.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:49.514
The rest stays with us
till we weigh other offers.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:52.677
Jackie Wong made these
arrangements with me.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:57.039
We were pioneers when you
were sucking your mother's tit,

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.789
and l don't see why
anything should change now.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.514
Because Jackie Wong is dead,

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.712
and Harry Yung has stepped down,
and l am the Cho Kun now.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.875
Hey, Joey.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.596
And l say we can't afford
to sell to old men the old way.

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.518
You know, Fred, in all my years,

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:20.919
nobody - and l mean nobody -
has ever talked to me like that. Nobody.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:24.589
No insult was intended, Mr Tedesco.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:28.156
But you people don't control
Canal Street any more.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:32.193
We do. I think when you
think through my offer to you,

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.232
you'll see that it's not
unprofitable to both sides.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:38.909
Who you gonna sell to?
The niggers? The spics?

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:41.474
You people don't have
that kinda weight here.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:44.990
They will bury you so fast
like you never was here.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.237
And if they don't, l will.

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.429
(in Chinese) Don't talk like that!

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:50.874
Don't sweat it.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.118
You're flying too high, kid,
and the air is very thin up there.

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.033
(in Chinese) Hello? Yes, it's Joey.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.316
I'm trying to reach Ban Sung.

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.711
Next week. I know.

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.871
Stop talking and listen to me!

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.839
- Got anything?
- It seems to be mostly financial talk.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.996
There's mention of
some problem in Thailand.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.396
A man in Bangkok is
saying something about...

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.156
I'm not quite sure about what.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.077
I want to talk to him in person.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:47.432
But he's very angry about a group from
Toronto that calls itself the Nam Soong.

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:50.028
Sister, you gotta be more precise.

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.594
That's going to be very difficult, Captain.

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:58.315
It's been many years since we've
heard the Hakka dialect spoken.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:02.115
They're talking aroundthings,
not about them.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:06.199
Damn it, Sister, that's the point!
They're not gonna spell it out for you.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:10.999
This is drug talk.
You got to use your imagination.

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.676
Listen...

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:20.397
you look like you don't eat enough to
keep a bird alive. Have some real food.

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:24.593
Captain White, l've managed to live
75 years without your help,

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.473
eating precisely what l'm eating now.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.670
My body fat is 1 2 per cent.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.788
My blood pressure's 1 20 over 80.

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:36.271
My lymphocyte count is 22 per cent.

01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:41.155
And if you want to compare
white blood cells and red blood cells,

01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:44.833
I might even outlast you, Captain,

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.839
red-meat eater that you obviously are.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:52.839
(conversation in Chinese
on surveillance radio)

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:54.596
Copy that.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:59.157
The perpetrator is saying he's
flying into Bangkok, next week -

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:01.111
under another name.

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:04.232
He's making his move. I want you
to get the DEA on his tail.

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.717
Call the Bangkok police, whatever
you gotta do to eyeball this scumbag.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.671
I'm sorry, Sister.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:15.037
I just wish to fuck l could go there myself.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:16.354
Come on.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:21.031
That'll be the day, the NYPD
springin' for a ticket to Hong Kong, eh?

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.550
You guys are doing a great job.
Keep it up.

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:27.356
Rizzo, come on.

01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:32.078
I want you to hit Chinatown
like Genghis Khan.

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:37.228
I want restaurant health violations.
I want immigration busts, gambling raids.

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:50.509
You were meant to shake up the gang
kids, not turn the whole city upside down.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:54.836
Let me make this real clear
to you, White, here and now.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.475
Joey Tai goes to the
Manhattan Borough president,

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:02.912
who he contributes
$100,000 a year to, all right?

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.918
The borough president goes to the mayor.
The mayor goes to me.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.270
And the word is, lay off.

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.870
That is the way the game is played, OK?

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:16.709
No more wiretaps on Joey Tai. And you
don't go to the Drug Enforcement Agency.

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:20.515
Going to outside agencies
isn't your job. It is Lou's job.

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.837
And what about the dead tourists,
Commissioner, huh?

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:27.316
I guess they don't add up to
a can of sardines, do they?

01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:31.513
You change your tune pretty fast just cos
that slimebag has tea with the mayor.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:35.917
You can't link Joey Tai to that. You know
it. The point is that you cease and desist.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:39.715
What if l don't, huh? What are you
gonna do? You gonna suspend me?

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:44.154
What will that look like
in the papers? You tell me.

01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:46.555
You suspend the most
decorated cop in the city.

01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:49.478
You call off an investigation
into the Chinese Mafia.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.513
What investigation? What Chinese Mafia?
The investigation's in your mind.

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.995
What's it gonna look like? You tell me.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.510
Your department's gonna
look like shit, that's what.

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:02.073
- Are you blackmailing me?
- Call it what you want.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:06.636
I've been swallowing the bullshit around
here for 10 years, and l'm choking on it.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.434
- You ever think about your pension?
- Fuck that!

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:12.915
That's what's wrong with this department.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.997
Everybody's so worried
about their pension.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.317
- Stanley...
- Oh.

01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:23.229
Never have l ever heard anything like this.
This is a fucking disgrace!

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:26.988
No, Lou. This is a fuckin' war,
and l'm not gonna lose it. Not this one.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:30.078
Not over politics.
It's always fuckin' politics!

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.158
This is Vietnam all over again.

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:35.747
Nobody wants to win this thing, do you?

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.554
Just flat out win, do they, Lou?

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.799
You go to the press again, White,
you know what you're doin'?

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:47.716
You're putting a gun to my head, Stanley.

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.910
That's what we are. We're four guys
in a room with guns to our heads.

01:09:56.840 --> 01:09:59.559
Kearney, will you step
outside for a minute?

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:10.154
I can't listen to this crap no more, Stanley.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.398
I can't watch a good man piss
his career down the drain like this.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:16.875
You never had any respect
for anything, did you?

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.275
- First, you throw away your wife.
- Shut up!

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.836
Now, you're turning on us cos
you got delusions of grandeur,

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.192
sucking up to this Chink reporter to get
your face on the tube. What is it with you?

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:30.710
- She do it sideways or something?
- Take it back, Lou.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:33.718
Don't tell me to take it back.
You got no shame.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.798
Connie was the best thing
you ever had in your life.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:44.269
That wasn't between cops. It was between
two guys from the old neighbourhood.

01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.870
Lou, l'm sorry.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.276
Look... I don't know why we're fighting.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:16.232
I love you. I love Connie.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:21.800
But when things aren't working at home,
you overreact to things on the street.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.797
We all had flings when we
were young. I'm not a prude.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.233
Why don't you at least sit down with
Connie and try to straighten this out?

01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:33.796
Even if you walk away,
you walk away friends.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:38.755
Cos no one's gonna care when you're
lyin' in your grave but Connie and me.

01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:42.589
Well?

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.678
What are you gonna do, Stanley?

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.956
I don't know. All l know
is that when l give up...

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.230
the system gives up.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.676
(banging on door)

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.272
(Stanley) Tracy!

01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.435
- Tracy!
- I'm coming!

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.433
Tracy!

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.074
Come on, open the door!

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.633
Hey!

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.559
- Oh.
- Who do you think you are?

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.114
And what are you doing with that?

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.878
These are my Chinese books.
I'm movin' in.

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.432
You what?

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:42.348
Did l misinterpret what you were saying
when l was lying on top of you?

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.869
Fuck you!

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.197
You Chinese, why don't you
ever say what you really think?

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:52.029
- I'm going to call Roger.
- I got somethin' l wanna say to him, too.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.435
Go away, will you, Stanley?

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.438
You're cracked. You're really crazy.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.915
Do you ever listen to yourself?

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:03.669
Come on, tell me... Ow! Tell me the truth.
There is no Roger, is there?

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:08.476
Know how l know? lt's because when you
talk about him, your eyes, they're not real.

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:10.397
There is a Roger.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:15.275
Well, tell me what you see in this guy.
Come on, tell me. I wanna know.

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.359
I want you to look me in the eyes,
and l want you to say it.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:25.596
What do l have to do to get
you out of here? Holy God!

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.598
Nothin'. It's hopeless.

01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.312
Surrender.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:37.631
Why am l laughing?

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:41.038
I'm becoming a crazy, like you.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.316
Oh...

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.396
I'm tired.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.915
I think l need to sleep.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:55.711
Maybe everybody's right.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:00.913
I'm chasing something that
doesn't exist. I ought to stop.

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.436
Jesus, l'm tired.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.074
It's the same thing as in 'Nam.

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:18.038
We lost because you
were smarter than us.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.108
And you couldn't even
have a decent parade.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:27.429
A fuckin' Chinese parade. They
come at you in 1 5 different directions.

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.276
Fuckin' joke.

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.672
Stanley...

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:45.195
you can't stay here.

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.877
Don't you have a friend l could call? Or
somebody you could stay with tonight?

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:57.354
You're the only friend l have left.

01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:04.438
I just wanna be with
somebody tonight. I just...

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.754
I don't know anybody else.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.798
Isn't that a real laugh?

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.275
I don't know anybody.

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.035
I feel like such an asshole.

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.716
Tracy, l, uh...

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.396
I love you.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:05.114
Did you hear what l said?

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.878
I thought there was
no Chinese word for love.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.956
I'm serious.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.513
I know you are.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.830
It was bad enough doing business
with the old general, that slime,

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:18.794
but Ban Sung's even worse. But you
lose all face by dealing with him direct.

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:23.710
- Ban Sung has an ego like an octopus.
- I know. And l don't trust his agent here.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:29.278
That fuck White Powder Ma knows
Ban Sung's got a crop of 1 50 to 200 tons.

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:34.317
Ma offered him 6,000 a key, plus
a shipment of kalashnikov assault rifles.

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:36.949
Hey.

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:39.878
(in Chinese) Hey, brother Ma! Hello!

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:41.632
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Have a seat.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.756
I'm so glad.

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:47.718
We meet at last, huh?

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:54.399
Little brother, l was very sorry to hear
that your father-in-law had been killed.

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:59.432
You know, it's not as easy for us
to do business without his guidance.

01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:05.598
We in the Nam Soong have been
wondering who could have done this.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.633
We think that whoever is responsible
for assassinating him

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:11.951
is no better than a crow that
flies up the ass of a dead animal

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.753
to reach the gut without work.

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:18.429
It's so dirty, so despicable.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:20.352
There's also some news.

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:23.830
I hear that this guy has been
causing trouble in Toronto.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.560
- Really?
- It's intolerable.

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:32.875
But don't worry, l'm not going
to let a crow bother me.

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:37.238
Brother Ma, you have
really enlightened me.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:40.472
I think we should share our information.

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:44.519
If we work together, we will
surely catch this stinking crow.

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:48.719
We'll tear off his wings
and cut off his tail.

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:52.314
I'm leaving in the morning.

01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:56.638
It would give me great pleasure
to invite you to dinner tonight.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.109
It would be great if you could come.

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.838
- Will you?
- OK.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.150
- I will be there.
- That's wonderful.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.150
All right, then.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.151
- I will see you tonight.
- See you tonight.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.514
Thanks, bye.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.675
(church bell ringing)

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:31.554
(conversation in Polish)

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:39.236
Will you open the door?

01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:42.796
Will you open the door?
What do l gotta do, break it down?

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.276
We gotta clear the air between us.
We gotta talk it out.

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.872
So talk.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.834
I don't know what got into me
with this Chinese girl.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.877
I care more about you
than anybody in the world.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.958
I mean, if you don't know that,
Connie, then...

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.194
So what do you want me to say?

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:14.314
Do you want me to forgive you, Stanley?
ls that what you want?

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:20.077
The truth is, l don't know what l want.

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:24.313
You wanna marry her?
You wanna have babies with her?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.833
Look, l didn't plan for
things to happen this way.

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.394
It just happened.

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:33.875
How do you think that makes me feel?

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.919
It makes me feel pretty low, Stanley.

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.600
I feel pretty low myself.

01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.711
It's about time.

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:48.636
You used me up, Stanley,
and then you burned me down.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.233
And l was a rock. I carried the cross
with you in Brooklyn and in Queens.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.794
I lived in a fuckin' war zone with you.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:02.311
Now, you're gonna go off and have babies
with a woman ten years younger than me.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:08.354
I don't have any pity for you, Stanley.
I... hope you feel bad.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:17.159
Look, why don't we just
let things ride for a while?

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.719
Just let some time pass?

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:24.196
- I don't have any time.
- I just need some time to think.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:27.236
I'm outta time.

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.352
I'm 35, sliding into 40.

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:33.308
So what do you want me to do?

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.398
You want me to just walk away,
just like that?

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:43.514
- Is that what you want?
- It's over, Stanley.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:48.718
Don't you get it? We're not playing
from the same sheet music any more.

01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:53.359
Now, will you get out of here...
before l start to cry?

01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:57.316
And l don't wanna do that.
Not in front of you.

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.236
I got my pride.

01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.436
(Stanley) You OK?

01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:47.555
I'm washing my face.

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.353
Look, Connie...

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.949
I'd feel a whole lot better if you'd just
keep the house and the bank accounts.

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:03.278
I mean, whatever's mine is yours.
I don't want the house anyway.

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:05.872
(Connie) Stanley?

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:37.149
- Stanley! What the hell's goin' on?
- They got Connie!

01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:50.358
Stanley! What, are you crazy?!

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:53.756
Stanley! Stanley, get outta there!

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.752
Stanley!

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.118
Get outta here!

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.715
- What, are you crazy?!
- He's evidence.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.756
He's dead!

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.555
Long time no see, Joey Tai.

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:59.954
It's an honour and a pleasure
to see you again, General.

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:03.070
Time looks like it's been good to you.

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.634
And to you, too, honourable cousin.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.314
The last time, as l remember,
both of us were taking orders.

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:13.713
Now we give them.

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:17.594
How is the health of our old friend,
the great Sao Mong Khawn,

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:20.188
who paved the golden road
of our success together?

01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:23.312
Truly, he is one of the great ones.

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:26.591
He'll be happy to see you,
Go Joey. I think so.

01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.113
Come. I think we'll surprise him.

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:58.116
Perhaps the general
doesn't recognise you.

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:01.992
The general likes heroin in his soup.

01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:04.759
Keeps him happy.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:08.589
Thank all gods, he feels no pain.

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:12.035
Come, Go Joey.

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:19.358
A kalashnikov!
Best rifle ever made.

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:24.149
The Russians used to give them
to us to fight the Burmese,

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:28.159
but now it's harder to get.
They want dollars.

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:30.919
Everybody wants dollars.

01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:36.831
One bullet, by the time it gets to me,
costs me one American dollar.

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:39.838
Dollars are like small fish:

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:45.159
difficult to catch, but not to be thrown
back, except as bait for something bigger.

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:48.070
I'll make it 4500 a kilo.

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:51.829
You give me 6500,

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:55.509
and l'll refine it to number four
right here myself.

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:59.269
- No, no.
- You'll have 200 keys in two weeks.

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.355
(speaks Chinese)

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:05.076
You know we can't control the quality
unless we refine it to stage four ourselves.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:09.671
- We've always bought stage three.
- You don't think my dragon pearl's good?

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:12.360
- I have the best chemists in the world.
- Maybe.

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.755
Better than your people in Hong Kong.

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:20.234
But then we would be forced
to unemploy our chemists.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:26.399
Go Joey, l offer you the chance of
putting your old friend out of his misery.

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:30.148
He was going to betray
us to the Americans.

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.192
Hold him!

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:43.439
(in Chinese) Save me! Save me!

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:48.919
No, don't!

01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.073
Don't shoot me!

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:56.033
(in English) You don't have
the bullet to spare.

01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:59.436
Each bullet can kill one Burmese soldier.

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:02.394
Then you don't have to use a gun.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.032
(in Chinese) Don't do this to me!

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:07.954
(in English) l'll buy him from you. $5,000.

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:10.196
Buy?

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.754
uS dollars, cash. Now.

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:15.838
- Why?
- Why not?

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:24.992
If you think this shit-faced old worm
is worth $5,000, you can have him.

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:26.917
Good!

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.554
(in Chinese) Let him go!

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:35.119
The food was great, and your hospitality
has left an impression, General.

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:39.438
But time is short. I must be in Hong Kong
before the banks close on Friday.

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:42.116
My final offer.

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:46.950
I'll make it 4900 a key for
your number three dragon pearl.

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:51.153
I'll take 200 kilos, deliverable
in Bangkok early next week.

01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:55.193
Another 800 kilos for the next
three months. Beyond that, l won't go.

01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:59.632
White Powder Ma's offer
makes yours insignificant.

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:04.515
Piss on him! Nam Soong Triad
is like dog shit littering the streets.

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:07.632
They'll be extinct in two years.

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:12.231
I think perhaps
l put my money on White Powder Ma.

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.236
I think so.

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:21.799
I think White Powder Ma
will be pleased to hear this.

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.877
Tell him yourself.

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.556
My gift to Ban Sung,

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:32.034
in honour of our association.

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:36.119
Let no motherless fuck ever
raise his head again between us.

01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:47.558
(priest reading service in Polish)

01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:56.396
I'm sorry, Stanley.

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:35.634
She looks beautiful, Stanley.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.956
(man) Let me through!

01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.316
Let me through!

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.716
Let me through!

01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:18.398
My deepest condolences
to you, Mr White.

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:22.115
She said it wasn't that Chinese girl.
Connie was a bigger person than that.

01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:26.914
She knew what was gonna happen.
You should have listened to her.

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:31.670
- You talked to Connie behind my back?
- Yes. I talked to Connie behind your back.

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:36.237
I knew Connie even longer than you.
Why shouldn't l talk to her if l want to?

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.996
You and l don't agree on anything.

01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:43.078
That's your problem.
You're fighting the whole world.

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:47.273
I'm sick and tired of Vietnam
as an excuse for everything you guys do.

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:51.075
You act like everybody in World War Il
and Korea came home to a picnic.

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:56.149
It wasn't. We lost 50,000 men in Korea.
We came back and nobody gave a shit.

01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:59.875
But we fitted in. Why can't you fit in?
What is it that's so different?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.639
I don't know what you're
talking about any more.

01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:07.436
You know! l know you're not one of
them professional Vietnam veterans

01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:11.678
who make a career outta groaning about
the war. You made something of yourself.

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:14.678
But you're still acting
like you're on a crusade.

01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:18.190
You think you got the right to trample
over anything and everything.

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:21.869
We got an arrangement,
a treaty with these Chinese.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.198
And however tarnished it is, it works.
Life is arrangement, Stanley.

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:30.108
Life is getting along. That's why
this neighbourhood is what it is.

01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:33.835
That's why eight million people
every day in this city can function.

01:36:33.960 --> 01:36:37.396
I don't want to argue with
you any more. Honest, l don't.

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.470
Take it easy.

01:36:41.480 --> 01:36:44.631
You need anything,
you call me. You hear?

01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:49.709
- There's always a bed at my place.
- Your arrangement is what killed Connie.

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:47.551
- Mr Tai?
- Mr Tai?

01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:51.559
Mr Tai, people in Chinatown are saying
Ronnie Chang was your protégé,

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:54.911
and his involvement in the murder
of Mrs White implicates you.

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:58.191
- Do you have any comment?
- That was a terrible tragedy,

01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:00.834
but l hardly knew Ronnie Chang.

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:03.918
Ronnie Chang represents much
of what is bad in Chinatown.

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:06.793
We are trying hard
to get rid of this element.

01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:11.516
My sources say you have returned from
Bangkok. Was there a business purpose?

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:14.598
I have interests there.
I import foods from the Far East.

01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:18.713
I also have a company that distributes
films in Thailand. Why do you ask?

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:22.515
Would this business take you into
the jungle 500 miles north of Bangkok,

01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:26.315
to meet with a reputed drug lord
by the name of Ban Sung?

01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:31.673
Do you know there are ethical
boundaries, Miss Tzu, even for the press?

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:34.712
Then does the name
White Powder Ma ring a bell?

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:39.553
Cut it.

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:44.117
I know your sources, and l'll raise
the issue with your legal department.

01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:55.191
Hey, l don't give a shit! l got the new lady
district attorney behind me on this now.

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:59.396
You think the NYPD is
gonna lift a finger for me? No.

01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.431
No, l'm not gonna tell you where l am.

01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:07.395
Look, l'm gonna make this case with the
DEA, Customs, lmmigration, if l have to.

01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:12.595
It's lnternal Affairs sniffing around again.
I bet you it's that fuck Kearney.

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:16.475
Get me Scappy Peck on the line at
Customs. He owes me a few favours.

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:19.160
What'd that son of a bitch
say about White Powder Ma?

01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:22.193
What is all this?! What's happened?

01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:25.239
I couldn't work in my office -
the walls have ears.

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:29.638
I let you use this place,
but this is ridiculous!

01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:35.275
Get off the phone. And get these
people out of here. Right now!

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:39.154
- Scappy Peck's on the line.
- No! No more calls.

01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.591
Look at this place! l give you
an inch and you take a mile!

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:48.598
I want these people out
of here right now. I mean it.

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:51.632
Look, l don't have time
to write you thank you notes.

01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:54.797
I'm going for Joey Tai's throat,
and nobody's gonna stop me.

01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.070
So just don't break my balls, all right?

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:01.432
Just hang in there a while, and you'll be
famous. That's what you want, isn't it?

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:06.236
You ungrateful, overbearing,
self-centred son of a bitch!

01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:10.558
- Don't tell me what l want.
- That's it. Let's hear it. "lgnorant Polack."

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:12.796
Everybody, get out!

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.514
- Sit down.
- (Herbert chuckles)

01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:19.596
What's so funny?

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:22.188
You drive everybody crazy, not just me.

01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:24.709
She's an aristocrat.
You can't push her around.

01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:28.515
- That's an aristocrat?
- She's Mandarin. They're like that.

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:32.076
Call Wainright back. This is bullshit.
We're not gettin' anywhere.

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:35.954
That dope is somewhere between
here and Thailand. It's on the move.

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:38.992
We gotta get a tap into
Joey Tai's office in the restaurant.

01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:42.829
You must be kidding me.
A white face would never get in there.

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:45.396
- Impossible.
- Come on.

01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:48.193
You could get in there
as a bus boy or somethin'.

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:53.189
After that... plenty of time off
for sleep, promotion.

01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:56.596
- No way, Captain.
- A tough kid from Kwangtung?

01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:00.076
A kid whose ancestors used
to hang in baskets in the Sierras,

01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.839
poking dynamite sticks in cliff faces?

01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:05.838
All l'm asking you to do
is be a fly on the wall.

01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:08.315
Your ancestors are rolling in their graves.

01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:12.069
Goddamn bullshit, Captain!
You're pushing too much. I'm no slave.

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:15.192
I gave up my security job.
I gave up my chauffeur job.

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:19.279
I send less money home.
I'm tired all the time. I don't eat right.

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:23.154
I'm getting sick. I die,
l'm fucked! My family's fucked!

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.390
- For what?
- What do you mean?

01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:29.671
You don't care nothing for people.
You make us all die for you.

01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:33.997
Let me tell you something.

01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:37.510
When your ancestors lived in caves
and scrabbled for coal in Poland,

01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:41.269
the Chinese were sailing
their ships across the Pacific.

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:44.756
- What do you know about my ancestors?
- What do you know about mine?

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:47.633
We were traders, shipbuilders, explorers.

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:52.038
We taught you agriculture. We gave you
oranges, grapes, your irrigation system.

01:41:52.320 --> 01:41:56.632
We dug your gold and silver, Stanley.
We taught you how to fish the Pacific.

01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:00.753
And still we were barred from
American citizenship until 1943.

01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:05.633
We worked so hard to build your railroads
that when our opium didn't come on time,

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:09.514
we were so desperate,
we helped each other kill ourselves!

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:14.879
But l'm not going to kill
myself for you, Captain White.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.549
No more "Chinaman Joe".
Those days are over.

01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:36.033
He'll be back. He loves me.

01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:40.229
Look, Stan, the kid's
pushing it to the limit.

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:43.670
I don't know, maybe we
should take him off the case.

01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:46.758
No undercover has lasted more
than a month in Chinatown.

01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:50.156
Let me tell you something.
That kid is tough as nails.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.639
And l'm going to make it up to him.

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.391
(in Chinese) lt's none of your business.

01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:10.751
You have to remember to call.
Why don't you call now?

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:14.992
Pick it up.

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:16.633
Shh.

01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:19.718
(in Chinese) This piece
ofnews is not good.

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:22.997
It puts us in a very bad place.
What's going to happen next?

01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:26.152
Will our faces appear
in the newspapers?

01:43:26.320 --> 01:43:33.715
How this reporter found out about your
trip to Thailand is a serious problem.

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.110
It worries me very much!

01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:42.752
It makes the Nam Soong very upset
about White Powder Ma.

01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:43.989
Very unhappy.

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:49.837
And also our old friends
the ltalians are very angry.

01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:53.591
Say something!

01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:57.360
Now you know what
you've got yourself into.

01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:03.237
You have some nerve, trying to kill
the cop on your own and not succeeding!

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:08.597
Are you thinking with
your ass or your brain?

01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:14.389
Our nephew has overemphasised
the Thailand end of the business,

01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:17.199
at the risk of endangering
our other enterprises!

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:20.033
How can you get rewards
without taking risks?

01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:24.159
- All you're doing is yelling at me.
- Bastard!

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:25.389
Watch what you're saying.

01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:29.394
uncle, listen to me. These guys
in Toronto are not a problem.

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:31.755
- Not a problem!
- They will be easy to take care of.

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:34.480
The ltalians are a separate issue.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.833
They'll want to work with us again
once we make a move.

01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:42.590
What they're saying in the papers,
let them. Who cares?

01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:45.513
And like a fly's bite on
an elephant's ass, ignore it.

01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:48.956
- I'll take care of it.
- You can take care of everything.

01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:53.870
uncle, the new shipment
arrived in Bangkok on Tuesday,

01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:56.156
and it was in Amsterdam by Saturday.

01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.754
I spoke to our chemist in Hong Kong.

01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:02.230
He guarantees us
one load every two weeks.

01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:04.237
Uncle, think about it.

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:08.029
What my father-in-law did in a year,
l did in three months.

01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:10.555
Three months! Nonsense!

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.470
When is it due in New York?

01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:19.598
Less than a week.
Our money is ready at the bank.

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:21.910
We can get it by next Monday.

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:24.310
How much faster do you
want me to move?

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:28.632
It's too dangerous to take a delivery now.

01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:30.756
- Can't wait a month?
- We can't wait!

01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:34.435
If you send it back to Harlem now,
it will only increase the risk!

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:38.189
You don't have to worry. I have
complete confidence in our couriers.

01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:40.999
I trust them. I'll take care of it.

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:44.038
Are we still working
with Rising Sun Lines?

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:46.191
No. It's a new company.

01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:48.430
Which new company?

01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:55.398
I think it's best not to tell you the name
of the ship now. It's too dangerous.

01:45:55.560 --> 01:45:57.516
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:00.518
Ah, shit! The goddamn name of the ship!

01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:04.751
White has a wire in your office.

01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:09.073
- Who?
- I don't know, but l'm gonna find out.

01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:10.633
Perez!

01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:15.435
I don't want anything to go wrong
with this shipment. It's important.

01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:17.869
- Don't worry.
- I want you at the pier.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.833
- All right. Where?
- The Kazimierz Pulaski.

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.918
Polish. It docks Tuesday. Pier 1 1 .

01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:26.955
- I'll be there.
- Thanks.

01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:58.510
(in Chinese) OK, everybody back to work.

01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:20.117
(woman screams)

01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:23.549
Stanley!

01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:30.275
Hey! Hey!

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.276
Herbert, you're gonna be all right.
I'm proud as hell of you.

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:49.356
Eleven.

01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:50.833
What?

01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:54.236
- The dock.
- Get to Beekman, for Christ's sakes!

01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:57.830
- What was the name of the ship?
- Dear God in heaven.

01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:01.396
Kazimierz Pu... Pul...

01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:12.796
He's at the bar.

01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:17.634
You and me are gonna have
a talk about Herbert Kwong.

01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:19.398
Get off me!

01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:36.635
Got you, you little fuckin'... I'm gonna
kill you, you little cocksuckin' bastard.

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:38.193
Fuckin'...

01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:44.836
Press charges! l'm beggin' ya.

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:47.110
Come on, Joey, call a cop.

01:48:47.240 --> 01:48:49.196
Come on, let's go to court.

01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:53.074
- Come on, l'm beggin' you.
- No more now, Stan.

01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:02.435
Oh, shit!

01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:12.876
Get out! Get out! Get the fuck out!
Come on! Let's go!

01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:28.550
Get your fuckin' ass in there.

01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:49.390
Fucker!

01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:54.749
Bastard!

01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:14.913
- You look like you're gonna die, beautiful.
- Oh, yeah? Don't count on it.

01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:18.157
You are. You're not gonna make it.

01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:21.035
Was it worth it?

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:24.789
You got anything you wanna tell me
before you go, sweetheart?

01:50:24.920 --> 01:50:26.876
Yeah. Fuck you.

01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:30.477
(officer) What happened, Captain?

01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.279
- Got one in the chest.
- Captain, what the hell happened?

01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:45.955
(in Chinese) You run too fast.

01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:48.634
So you fall down, see?

01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:54.591
Looking back
on the days of Jackie Wong,

01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:57.593
things were so peaceful.

01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:03.471
Now, in the interest of all Chinatown,

01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:07.952
our relationship with the press,

01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:12.272
with City Hall, especially with the ltalians,

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:16.319
has to return to the old ways.

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:19.392
Joey, he has a point there.

01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:25.510
I think that Joey is young
and inexperienced.

01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:28.035
He has offended Harry.

01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:33.797
This has caused Harry to colour
the situation with personal animosity.

01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:38.715
If it were up to me,
l would take care of it right away.

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:42.031
Dealing with things this way
will benefit no one.

01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:44.037
In dealing with the white devils,

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:48.273
we have always stuck together
through thick and thin.

01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:53.109
You don't trust me now.

01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:58.671
No matter what, l guarantee
that you won't lose anything.

01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:00.910
I will be at the pier to pick up the goods.

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:05.113
Look, l'm talking about
one ship outta Rotterdam.

01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:07.196
The Kazimierz Pulaski.

01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:12.035
What the hell's the problem?

01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:14.799
You know how big that ship is, Stanley?

01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:19.072
We can't go running around rippin' up
floor plates, cuttin' boilers open,

01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:21.760
pokin' through 10,000 Edam cheeses,

01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:26.158
or drillin' in a shipment of Danish
furniture on your say-so, Stanley.

01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:30.637
It's a lot of money involved. We got
passengers. We got waitin' time.

01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:34.989
Besides, it's the flagship
of a foreign government.

01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:38.669
Hey, look, all l'm asking you
to do is go through one ship.

01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:41.439
I got a deathbed confession.
A cop died for this.

01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:45.314
You're pissing against the wind, ace.
Get a live informant.

01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:01.113
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:13.599
- You shouldn't have come here.
- Embarrassed your friends will see me?

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:18.032
Tonight's the night. Get your crew to pier
1 1 . We're gonna watch the rice boil over.

01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:21.630
- I have to talk to you.
- What? What is it? What is it?

01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:24.672
Are you gonna weasel out on me?
What? Spit it out!

01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:28.759
I can't go there. I've been told
not to do any more stories on this.

01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:32.557
- You've been told? By who?
- By the network, Stanley.

01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:36.753
What? There's a war going on down in
Chinatown and you're not gonna cover it?

01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:40.350
Look, l don't think this
is the time or the place.

01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:44.268
Why don't you tell me the time and a
place, and we'll go there and discuss it?

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:47.631
Would you quit? There's times
you have to know when to quit.

01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:50.433
Oh, yeah? Did Herbert quit?

01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:54.512
What's wrong with you?
He's dead! Connie's dead!

01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:57.677
I'm putting my whole life on the line,
and you're sitting here,

01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:00.837
acting like some
phoney white-bread cunt!

01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:04.748
You're not even white. You're Chinese.
Those are your people down there!

01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:07.713
I mean, are you a reporter?
Are you a whore? What?

01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:09.796
You're a son of a bitch, Stanley.

01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:14.311
The day you put your ass on the line,
that's the day you'll be a real reporter.

01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:18.592
My ass on the line?
Goddamn you, Stanley!

01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:22.352
I was almost killed for you.

01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:26.075
I was raped. And l'm
not gonna die for you.

01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:29.795
I'm not gonna be pushed like
Connie and Herbert. They're dead...

01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:32.309
What do you mean, you were raped?

01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:35.796
- You're like poison, Stanley.
- Who did this to you?

01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:38.559
- Who?
- Rape is rape.

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:40.750
- Who? Who raped you?
- Three boys.

01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:42.199
- Who?
- Three boys.

01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:46.871
- Who raped you?!
- Three Chinese boys, Stanley.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.231
He went too far this time,
that fucking Joey.

01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:54.478
It didn't happen to you! lt happened to me!

01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:57.353
You don't give a shit about me, do you?

01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:01.115
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Leave, Stanley.

01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:04.038
Go away and leave me alone.

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:07.153
You should take a look
at yourself, Stanley.

01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:11.274
You're selfish. You're callous.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.434
You're indifferent to suffering.

01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.476
Your wife was right,

01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:22.591
and you still don't get the message.

01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:28.155
How many more people are
you gonna kill before you do?

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.152
- Tracy, l...
- No. Just go away and leave me alone.

01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:45.878
Don't say anything. Just go away!

01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:14.076
Hello, Stanley.

01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:16.910
You weren't in your office.

01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:18.996
Hello, Lou.

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:25.515
Francis, l'm disappointed.
You didn't show for Connie's funeral.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.560
You were warned about Joey Tai.

01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:31.638
Clean your desk.
You're goin' back to Brooklyn.

01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:36.114
You've been properly served.

01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:41.196
I'm sorry. You were told to lay off.

01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:46.919
If you think that l'm gonna
stand for that, you're wrong.

01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:51.158
You don't like it, resign. You're through
anyway. It's all over for you, White.

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:54.238
Your balls'll be cut off Friday!

01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:57.954
You're not cops, you're lies, both of you.

01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:01.755
- You don't bend, you break, Stanley.
- Then l'll break.

01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:08.037
- You care too much, Stanley.
- How can anybody care too much?

01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.751
Go on. Go on.

01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:19.838
What the...?

01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:22.632
Jesus!

01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:34.990
Get outta my sight!

01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:37.111
What is this?

01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:42.749
- What do you want?
- Tell me where the heroin is on the ship,

01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:45.758
and you walk outta
here with a head start.

01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:46.949
You...

02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:52.752
Joey!

02:00:54.600 --> 02:00:55.749
Joey!

02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:57.836
(Joey screams)

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.876
Come on!

02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:05.156
Come on!

02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:29.076
(distant sirens)

02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:40.596
Give me your gun.

02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:44.314
For pity's sake. Please.

02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:46.874
Tell me where it is!

02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:49.908
Mercedes. Please.

02:02:09.760 --> 02:02:11.716
(gunshot)

02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:16.398
(brass band playing funeral music)

02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:24.557
There are those who liken
Chinatown to a skating pond.

02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:29.196
On the surface we see a picture-postcard
landscape of snowflakes and skaters,

02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:32.312
but underneath,
the cannibal fish, the gangs,

02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:36.433
the sharks, those who control the
gangs, and the whales, the big bosses,

02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:38.596
all move in deadly swarms.

02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:43.555
These bosses, some people are saying,
are in an international crime network,

02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:47.070
with its headquarters in Hong Kong.
Everyone denies it.

02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:50.590
But in the wake of the shootings
of Joey Tai and Ronnie Chang,

02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:53.109
questions are mushrooming left and right.

02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:57.279
Charges of illegal wiretapping
have been levelled by HJ Yung,

02:02:57.400 --> 02:02:59.630
head of the Hun San association,

02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:02.957
resulting in the removal
of Captain Stanley White.

02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:07.631
One wonders if this is not a smoke screen
to distract from the main issue,

02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:11.719
which is what part the Hun San
plays in this Chinese opera.

02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:14.274
Tracy Tzu, Chinatown.

02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:16.876
OK, that's it.

02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:24.674
Stanley! Stanley!

02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:32.638
- Where's he going?
- He's a great cop, but he won't stop.

02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:36.909
- White! What the hell is goin' on?
- I'm arresting these people.

02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:40.478
You wanna do something
they'll remember in Chinatown?

02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:43.194
Book 'em! Be a cop again!

02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:56.392
Stanley!

02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:05.876
Stanley!

02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:10.634
Stanley! Oh, thank God!

02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:32.995
You know, you were right.
I was wrong. Sorry.

02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:36.477
I'd like to be a nice guy. I would.

02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:40.038
I just don't know how to be nice.

02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:42.594
You're really cracked, you know that?

02:05:41.360 --> 02:05:43.794
(sings in Chinese)
