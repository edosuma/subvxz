00:24.829 --> 00:29.711
Here's another geography
question for $1000.

00:29.746 --> 00:32.892
What mountain range separates
Casablanca from Sahara desert?

00:32.927 --> 00:35.674
Is it A, the Himalayas,
B, the Atlas mountains,

00:35.709 --> 00:39.262
C, the Pyrenees or
D, the Aberdare mountains?

00:40.303 --> 00:42.592
- Doesn't prove anything.
- It proves everything, and you know it.

00:42.627 --> 00:47.029
- Do you want to see it again?
- No, thanks. I hate watching myself on TV.

00:47.064 --> 00:49.223
Roddy, why did you do it?

00:49.258 --> 00:50.855
Have you ever been in debt, Lizzie?

00:50.890 --> 00:54.324
And I mean real debt.
It changes everything.

00:54.359 --> 00:56.111
- That's no excuse.
- What are you doing?

00:56.146 --> 00:58.826
- The right thing.
- Look, Lizzie,

00:58.861 --> 01:01.660
if this is your way of asking
for a raise, it worked.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.548
Hey, how much do you want?

01:03.583 --> 01:05.459
I don't want money, Roddy.
I'm not you.

01:05.494 --> 01:07.501
All right, you don't want money.
What do you want?

01:07.536 --> 01:08.957
I want to be able to sleep at night.

01:08.992 --> 01:12.073
I want to be able to be proud
of the show the way I used to be.

01:15.561 --> 01:19.318
What are you going to do, slip it under
the producer's door anonymously?

01:19.353 --> 01:22.190
Didn't even have the courage
to write your own name on it.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.882
Aw, Lizzie, all right,
look, I'm sorry.

01:25.917 --> 01:28.947
- Hey, it'll never happen again.
- Damn right it won't.

01:28.982 --> 01:32.163
Okay, okay.
Look, you win.

01:33.034 --> 01:34.982
I'll quit the show.

01:35.017 --> 01:37.486
But just give me one day.

01:37.521 --> 01:39.312
Let me do it on my own,

01:39.347 --> 01:42.314
so I can do it with whatever's
left of my dignity.

01:43.607 --> 01:46.373
- If this is a trick, I don't...
- it's not a trick. It's not a trick.

01:46.408 --> 01:48.832
I swear to you.
Watch, watch tonight.

01:48.867 --> 01:51.541
Before the bonus round,
I'll make an announcement.

01:53.450 --> 01:55.624
God help me.

01:56.956 --> 01:58.762
Okay.

01:59.724 --> 02:01.219
Okay.

02:10.518 --> 02:13.300
How about another drink
before I walk the plank?

02:13.830 --> 02:15.731
Sure.

03:04.166 --> 03:06.746
Thank you. Welcome back to
Treasure chest. I'm Roddy Lankman.

03:06.781 --> 03:08.592
Well, before we start
the bonus round,

03:08.627 --> 03:11.213
I do have an important
announcement to make.

03:11.248 --> 03:14.031
It's about time. - My contract here at
Treasure chest is almost up,

03:14.066 --> 03:16.869
and a lot of people have been
asking what my plans are.

03:16.904 --> 03:19.155
Well, this afternoon,
I made a big decision,

03:19.190 --> 03:21.772
and I'd like to share it
with all you people.

03:22.956 --> 03:26.813
I just signed a new 5 year contract,
which means I'm going to be right here

03:26.848 --> 03:30.517
doing what I always do for as long
as they want me to be here.

03:30.552 --> 03:32.977
What do you think about that?

03:51.707 --> 03:54.860
Come on.
Oh, my god.

04:00.768 --> 04:02.896
Come on.

04:02.931 --> 04:04.424
Oh, my god.

04:22.231 --> 04:24.497
MONK Season 3 Epi. 08
Mr. Monk and the Gameshow

05:20.379 --> 05:22.710
- Oh, this is looking good.
- You think so?

05:22.745 --> 05:24.977
Oh, it's looking fantastic.

05:25.012 --> 05:28.590
A little more mayonnaise,
a pinch of paprika.

05:28.625 --> 05:30.264
Maybe two pinches.
Maybe three pinches.

05:30.299 --> 05:32.166
- Okay, that's perfect.
- Maybe four pinches.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.243
Okay, Kevin, I think
that's enough. Thank you.

05:34.278 --> 05:38.321
We are going to need some pepper,
and I think I have some upstairs.

05:38.356 --> 05:42.374
Maybe I should bring all my
seasonings down here

05:42.409 --> 05:44.011
if we're going to be
cooking all week.

05:44.046 --> 05:46.527
All week? - Here's something
you might find interesting.

05:46.562 --> 05:51.757
This is only the eighth time in my life
I have ever had egg salad. - Really?

05:51.792 --> 05:54.238
And how much do you want
to bet I can name all eight?

05:56.497 --> 05:58.951
The first time was in third grade.

05:58.986 --> 06:01.894
I traded sandwiches with a kid
named Stuart kramer.

06:01.929 --> 06:05.948
Then three years after that,
my cousin's confirmation party.

06:05.983 --> 06:10.595
Two years after that, I was in
a restaurant. I ordered tuna fish.

06:10.630 --> 06:12.216
- Do you like to laugh?
- No, I don't.

06:12.251 --> 06:14.391
Well, get ready to,
because I knew it was egg salad.

06:14.426 --> 06:17.097
I could smell it,
but the waitress kept saying to me,

06:17.132 --> 06:19.987
"No, it's tuna fish."
Phone.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.619
We're on number three.
Remember where we are.

06:22.654 --> 06:25.139
Hello?
Oh, Sharona.

06:25.174 --> 06:27.562
Sharona, how, how's your mom?

06:27.597 --> 06:31.667
Oh, good. Oh, thank god.
Thank god for modern medicine.

06:32.283 --> 06:35.045
Not, not too good, actually.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.366
He's in the kitchen right now

06:37.401 --> 06:40.566
naming every egg salad
sandwich he ever had.

06:41.503 --> 06:45.001
Eight, including today.

06:45.036 --> 06:49.925
It's not funny.
Stop, stop laughing.

06:51.044 --> 06:54.258
Sharona, I don't, I don't know
why you asked him to look in on me.

06:54.293 --> 06:58.152
I'm not a child.
Please stop laughing.

06:58.813 --> 07:02.926
Okay, I'll call you back.
Give her my best. Okay.

07:03.980 --> 07:09.822
And when you come back...
bring a gun. Okay. bye.

07:10.795 --> 07:14.444
That was Sharona.
She won't be coming back until monday.

07:14.479 --> 07:16.951
Monday.
Wow.

07:16.986 --> 07:19.336
We are going to need
some more food.

07:19.371 --> 07:21.846
Let's make a list.

07:24.072 --> 07:25.934
Okay.

07:25.969 --> 07:28.414
Bread, juice

07:28.449 --> 07:31.803
paprika, milk...

07:31.838 --> 07:33.689
No milk. Right.

07:33.724 --> 07:38.208
Crossing that off the list.
Adding to the list, bok choy.

07:38.243 --> 07:39.751
Doorbell.

07:44.029 --> 07:46.357
Who is it?

07:46.855 --> 07:50.583
It's Trudy's father.
It's my father-in-law.

07:50.618 --> 07:53.221
- Yeah, he called this morning.
- Why didn't you tell me?

07:53.256 --> 07:56.194
I did. I wrote it on a post-it note.

07:56.229 --> 07:58.411
We need more of those, by the way.
We're out of them.

08:00.555 --> 08:03.866
- Adrian.
- Dwight.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.549
Dad.

08:13.686 --> 08:17.486
Yeah.
I missed you, too.

08:18.926 --> 08:21.033
Mr. E., here's your coffee.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.678
Sorry it took so long.
I'm still not used to that kitchen.

08:24.713 --> 08:27.696
- Careful. It's hot.
- Thank you, Kevin.

08:28.334 --> 08:31.752
- Oh. There's something in there.
- That's a raisin.

08:31.787 --> 08:33.440
I put it in to sweeten the coffee.

08:33.475 --> 08:36.837
Little trick I picked up when
I was waiting tables in Aspen, Colorado,

08:36.873 --> 08:39.967
which I did for two summers.
Not two consecutive summers,

08:40.001 --> 08:41.359
'cause there was
a summer in between...

08:41.394 --> 08:42.702
- Thank you, Kevin.
- Thank you, Kevin.

08:42.736 --> 08:45.012
- Delicious.
- Okay.

08:48.152 --> 08:51.717
- Oh, happy birthday.
- Oh, thank you.

08:52.301 --> 08:56.926
- Did you get my card?
- Uh, yes, I did.

08:56.961 --> 08:58.487
Did you look inside?

08:58.522 --> 09:02.922
'Cause the punch line was
on the inside. - Yes, I did.

09:02.957 --> 09:06.435
- It was very funny.
- It was a pun.

09:06.470 --> 09:10.769
It was very funny. It's on my mantel.
Everybody likes it.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.836
- How is Marcia?
- Much better.

09:16.871 --> 09:20.397
She's, uh, volunteering
as a grief counselor.

09:21.297 --> 09:23.426
Believe me, she's good at it.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.343
Send her my love.

09:27.378 --> 09:30.551
Well, I was hoping that wouldn't be
necessary. That's why I'm here.

09:30.586 --> 09:34.338
I was hoping you might come back
with me to Los angeles.

09:34.373 --> 09:37.104
I'm producing a new game show.

09:37.139 --> 09:39.294
It's called "Treasure chest."

09:39.932 --> 09:42.482
Wow. Wow.
Is that your show?

09:42.517 --> 09:44.514
Because I love that show.

09:44.549 --> 09:46.843
Who comes up with
all those questions?

09:46.878 --> 09:49.774
Well, we have a staff of writers.

09:51.339 --> 09:53.556
'Cause I'll tell you something,

09:53.591 --> 09:56.274
that is something I've always
thought I would be good at.

09:56.309 --> 09:58.315
I'm always asking people questions,

09:58.350 --> 10:01.242
and a lot of the time, they
are genuinely stumped.

10:01.277 --> 10:03.623
That's true. We are.

10:05.158 --> 10:08.916
Adrian...
My little show's in trouble.

10:08.951 --> 10:11.044
- I think it's serious.
- What is it?

10:11.079 --> 10:13.727
Well, I'd rather you
see for yourself.

10:13.762 --> 10:16.706
Do you think you could come
down to L. A. for a couple of days?

10:16.741 --> 10:19.048
Plenty of room.
Marcia would love it.

10:19.083 --> 10:23.976
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.
Dwight, I, I can't.

10:24.011 --> 10:27.465
Uh, I, I, I can't just leave.

10:27.500 --> 10:32.730
- Sharona's not here.
- I'm here. We could go.

10:32.765 --> 10:34.497
Uh, I don't know.

10:34.532 --> 10:36.479
Come on, it'll be fun.

10:36.514 --> 10:40.726
Three guys on a road trip
to Hollywood.

11:09.432 --> 11:11.299
- Is Roddy Lankman here?
- Lenny,

11:11.334 --> 11:13.519
tell Bernie not to start
the music cues too soon,

11:13.554 --> 11:15.446
and make sure the affiliates
are sitting in the front row.

11:15.481 --> 11:18.010
- Mr. E., is Roddy Lankman here?
- He's probably in makeup.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.112
Okay, do you think
I could talk to him?

11:19.147 --> 11:21.904
'Cause I have some ideas
that I'd like to run by him.

11:21.939 --> 11:24.770
Don't worry, mr. E., I won't
embarrass you. - I'm sure you won't.

11:24.805 --> 11:27.507
It's just that Roddy doesn't
like to be disturbed before the show.

11:27.542 --> 11:28.990
Tanya.

11:30.541 --> 11:33.960
This is Kevin dorfman, a friend
of mine from San francisco.

11:33.995 --> 11:35.547
Would you mind showing him around?

11:35.582 --> 11:37.419
- I'd be happy to.
- You're the pointer.

11:37.454 --> 11:39.640
Oh, point to something.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.660
It looks better.
She makes everything look better, Tanya.

11:42.695 --> 11:45.808
- Hey, how did you get this job?
- I want you to meet someone.

11:49.714 --> 11:51.463
Val birch.

11:51.498 --> 11:53.443
This is my old friend, Adrian monk.

11:53.478 --> 11:54.962
Adrian.

11:54.997 --> 11:57.095
Well, gym class must have
been hell with a name like that.

11:57.130 --> 11:58.613
Yes.
Yes, it was. Thank you.

11:58.648 --> 12:00.774
Are you nearly done, or do
you just like touching me?

12:00.809 --> 12:02.915
Adrian's here from San francisco.

12:02.950 --> 12:06.709
Oh, Frisco. God-awful town.
I was there last year.

12:06.744 --> 12:08.437
It was foggy the whole week.

12:08.472 --> 12:11.173
When are they going to do
something about all that fog?

12:11.208 --> 12:14.573
Well, I, I don't know.
I'll make some calls.

12:14.608 --> 12:17.521
I couldn't see a damn thing,
not even that, um...

12:17.556 --> 12:18.993
Uh, Golden bridge they got.

12:19.028 --> 12:22.471
- The Golden gate.
- No, genius, the bridge.

12:22.506 --> 12:24.374
Right. That's what they
call it the golden...

12:24.409 --> 12:26.556
Okay, okay.
Testing, 1, 2, 3.

12:26.591 --> 12:29.008
We're done, okay?

12:31.609 --> 12:34.858
That idiot's won seven times in a row.

12:34.893 --> 12:39.525
Adrian, I know he's cheating.
I just can't figure out how.

12:46.285 --> 12:50.156
- Roddy Lankman?
- Uh, yeah.

12:50.191 --> 12:54.050
Kevin dorfman. I'm a big fan
of yours, sir. A major fan.

12:54.085 --> 12:58.244
- Okay, how you doing?
- Look, I know we just met, Roddy,

12:58.279 --> 13:01.546
but I understand you have
your own production company.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.224
Well, that's good,
because I have an idea for a show,

13:04.259 --> 13:07.254
and if you're interested,
we can produce it together.

13:07.289 --> 13:09.529
- I really can't.
- Okay.

13:09.564 --> 13:10.895
It's called "40 winks."
In a nutshell,

13:10.930 --> 13:17.306
three contestants, three beds.
The first one who falls asleep wins.

13:17.341 --> 13:20.351
So we're watching people
fall asleep? - Exactly.

13:20.386 --> 13:23.789
- You snooze, you win.
- I can't do that.

13:23.824 --> 13:26.788
I, I can't even really talk
to strangers about ideas.

13:26.823 --> 13:28.944
It's for legal reasons.

13:28.979 --> 13:31.561
Well, it's a good thing
I'm not a stranger, then.

13:31.596 --> 13:34.001
- I'm friends with Dwight Ellison.
- Oh, really?

13:34.036 --> 13:38.350
I'm here with Adrian monk,
the detective. - Detective?

13:38.385 --> 13:41.661
Yeah, from San francisco.
Dwight brought him here to look around.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.409
He's having some sort of
problem with the show.

13:45.593 --> 13:47.662
Huh.

13:47.697 --> 13:50.120
- Nice to meet you.
- All right.

13:51.222 --> 13:53.659
- A detective?
- Will you keep it down?

13:53.694 --> 13:55.759
He's from San francisco.
That's all I know.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.260
- So what?
- So what?

13:58.295 --> 14:00.718
- He's going to be watching us.
- So let him watch.

14:00.753 --> 14:04.101
He's not going to figure it out.
The system is perfect.

14:04.136 --> 14:06.212
Now, look, here's what's
going to happen.

14:06.247 --> 14:08.848
I'm going to win tonight,
I'm going to win tomorrow,

14:08.883 --> 14:11.949
and I'm going to keep on winning
until I say we're done.

14:12.790 --> 14:15.847
- It's too dangerous.
- It's too dangerous, huh?

14:15.882 --> 14:19.875
Well, I guess you should have thought
of that before you killed your assistant.

14:19.910 --> 14:23.754
Now let's go back inside.
It's showtime.

14:34.190 --> 14:36.106
It's driving me nuts,
Adrian. I need someone

14:36.107 --> 14:37.809
to look at this from a different angle.

14:37.844 --> 14:39.987
- Maybe I'm missing something.
- Are you sure he's cheating?

14:40.022 --> 14:43.142
He has to be.
That Neanderthal Val birch...

14:43.177 --> 14:45.115
he's been answering
graduate-level questions

14:45.150 --> 14:48.129
in geography, history,
astronomy.

14:48.164 --> 14:50.156
Nobody's that smart,
not even you.

14:50.191 --> 14:52.695
So he has to be getting
the questions in advance.

14:52.730 --> 14:55.144
Maybe somebody's helping
him, one of the writers.

14:55.179 --> 14:56.379
I thought of that.

14:56.414 --> 14:59.195
For the last two weeks, I've
been writing all the questions myself.

14:59.230 --> 15:01.405
These are the ones
we're using tonight.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.291
- Who else gets to see these?
- Nobody.

15:04.326 --> 15:06.744
Not the director,
not even Roddy.

15:06.779 --> 15:08.668
These envelopes stay sealed

15:08.703 --> 15:12.966
until he opens them on stage
during the actual game.

15:17.315 --> 15:19.130
What are you doing?
What is that?

15:19.165 --> 15:20.768
It's Roddy Lankman's pencil.

15:21.441 --> 15:23.547
Yeah, those are his teeth marks.

15:23.582 --> 15:25.229
This is what you
call a collectible.

15:25.264 --> 15:27.157
You can look,
but don't touch.

15:27.192 --> 15:28.781
- I don't want to touch it.
- Yeah, right.

15:28.816 --> 15:30.456
Seriously, don't touch it.

15:30.491 --> 15:33.187
Live from Hollywood, California,

15:33.222 --> 15:35.702
let's grab those shovels and go digging,

15:35.737 --> 15:39.373
'cause the name of the game
is "Treasure chest".

15:39.408 --> 15:43.175
Here's your host,
Roddy Lankman!

15:44.614 --> 15:46.585
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome back to "Treasure chest."

15:46.620 --> 15:49.385
I'm Roddy Lankman, and, boy,
what a nice crowd we have today,

15:49.420 --> 15:51.836
but let's welcome back
our reigning champion.

15:51.871 --> 15:55.600
He's been here for three weeks. He shows
absolutely no signs of slowing down.

15:55.635 --> 15:57.711
He's a retired limousine driver
from Woodland hills.

15:57.746 --> 16:00.798
In his free time, he likes hunting
and fishing up in the Bluestone valley.

16:00.833 --> 16:03.066
Welcome back to the show, Val birch!

16:12.041 --> 16:14.286
What is the largest desert in Asia?

16:14.321 --> 16:18.242
Is it A, the Sahara, B, the Negev,
C, the Gobi, D..

16:18.277 --> 16:19.317
C, the Gobi.

16:19.352 --> 16:21.148
Correct for $1,000!

16:25.711 --> 16:29.287
Thank you, Tanya.
The next question, for $1,500.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.098
which Monarch is sometimes
known as "the Tragic queen"?

16:32.133 --> 16:35.066
Was it A, queen Elizabeth,
B, Marie antoinette,

16:35.101 --> 16:37.080
C, Catherine the Great...

16:37.115 --> 16:39.766
B, Mary ann tonette.

16:39.801 --> 16:42.387
Uh, that is correct.
Marie antoinette.

16:45.356 --> 16:47.167
He mispronounced it.

16:48.198 --> 16:50.443
Here's a $2,000 question,

16:50.478 --> 16:52.409
and I see this one has a visual clue,

16:52.444 --> 16:54.622
so, Tanya, if you could
bring up our visual.

16:55.337 --> 16:56.788
Thank yon very much!

16:56.823 --> 16:59.240
Which founding father
lived in this house?

16:59.275 --> 17:03.350
Was it A, George washington,
B, Thomas jefferson, C...

17:03.385 --> 17:06.465
- B, Jefferson.
- Jefferson is correct for $2,000.

17:06.501 --> 17:09.242
Pitching another perfect game,
Val birch.

17:10.173 --> 17:11.717
- Did you see that?
- What?

17:11.752 --> 17:15.380
He didn't even look at the picture,
and he still got it right.

17:15.415 --> 17:18.433
How? - Maybe they're
signaling each other.

17:18.468 --> 17:22.115
Val birch is still in the lead
with a grand total of $234,000!

17:23.762 --> 17:26.719
That's a lot of money, Val.
What do you plan to do with it?

17:26.753 --> 17:29.340
I don't know.
Let's just keep playing.

17:34.611 --> 17:36.296
Marcia.

17:36.331 --> 17:38.765
Come see what the cat dragged in.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.840
- Adrian.
- Marcia.

17:41.595 --> 17:43.678
Welcome home.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.876
Thank you.

17:46.971 --> 17:48.850
You okay?

17:48.885 --> 17:51.033
Yes, I'm, I'm just...

17:51.762 --> 17:54.754
- there are so many memories.
- I know.

17:55.546 --> 17:58.027
That's why we could never move.

17:58.062 --> 17:59.969
Oh, honey, this is Kevin dorfman.

18:00.004 --> 18:04.159
Hello. Kevin dorfman.
I live above Adrian.

18:04.194 --> 18:07.222
May I say what a lovely home you
have here. - Oh, thank you.

18:07.257 --> 18:09.286
- Spanish style, isn't it?
- Yes.

18:09.321 --> 18:12.555
Yes, I thought so.
I grew up in a house just like this,

18:12.590 --> 18:16.255
except the dining room
was over on this side...

18:31.340 --> 18:32.636
Hello.

18:33.096 --> 18:35.658
Hi, mom, dad.
This is Adrian.

18:36.558 --> 18:39.889
- Mr. and Mrs. Ellison.
- It's Dwight and Marcia.

18:39.924 --> 18:42.802
I feel like we're old friends,
the way Trudy talks about you.

18:42.837 --> 18:45.307
She's been sending us
articles and newspaper stories.

18:45.342 --> 18:47.631
You can believe about 40% of that stuff.

18:47.666 --> 18:49.864
Come in, come in.

18:49.899 --> 18:51.952
You must be exhausted.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.113
- Nice to see you.
- So good to see you, too.

18:55.148 --> 18:58.064
Oh, that's okay.
We don't mind a little dirt.

18:58.099 --> 19:02.148
- Almost done.
- Okay.

19:03.595 --> 19:06.036
You have a beautiful home.

19:07.452 --> 19:09.680
Well, that's fascinating.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.751
Well, come on in.

19:11.786 --> 19:14.512
I'm sure you must
all be exhausted.

19:15.075 --> 19:17.814
Adrian, you remember
where the guest room is?

19:17.849 --> 19:19.423
Oh, yeah.

19:58.383 --> 20:00.628
It's still how she left it.

20:00.663 --> 20:02.164
Do you want to go in?

20:02.199 --> 20:05.639
There might be something
you want to keep.

20:11.027 --> 20:13.194
I can't.

20:13.229 --> 20:15.133
I know.

20:15.168 --> 20:18.283
It took me 2 and half years.

20:18.318 --> 20:22.220
How did you do it, Marcia?

20:22.255 --> 20:24.215
How did you survive?

20:25.824 --> 20:27.503
I didn't think I would.

20:31.246 --> 20:33.014
I was buried alive.

20:33.991 --> 20:35.289
Buried alive.

20:38.952 --> 20:42.639
And then one day,
the sun came up.

20:42.674 --> 20:44.106
My garden was blooming.

20:44.141 --> 20:47.145
Kids were riding by the house
on their bikes,

20:47.180 --> 20:50.361
and I decided to give
the world a second chance.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.731
It's still a beautiful world, Adrian.

21:07.698 --> 21:10.336
- You don't have to do that.
- It's no problem.

21:10.371 --> 21:15.249
I remember how you like
everything separated. It's okay.

21:15.284 --> 21:18.296
So, Kevin, did I understand
Adrian correctly?

21:18.331 --> 21:20.410
You won the lottery
a couple years ago?

21:20.445 --> 21:22.462
Yes, I did.
That is accurate.

21:25.063 --> 21:27.511
And you're probably wondering
what happened to all the money.

21:27.546 --> 21:29.920
That's a fair question.
Here's a tip.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.316
if you're ever lucky enough
to win the big jackpot,

21:32.351 --> 21:35.838
you should probably not make
some of the mistakes I made.

21:35.873 --> 21:38.992
For one thing, Vegas.
it's a good place to avoid.

21:39.027 --> 21:41.967
Secondly, if you're ever
going to hire an accountant,

21:42.002 --> 21:44.667
you might want to make sure
he's certified.

21:44.702 --> 21:47.269
And most importantly, never,
under any circumstances,

21:47.304 --> 21:49.657
marry Lisa Abromowitz.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.829
I'll try to remember that.

21:54.864 --> 21:56.988
Or her sister Shelly.

22:02.884 --> 22:05.230
Is something wrong
with the food?

22:05.265 --> 22:07.711
Oh, no, mom.
It's perfect.

22:07.746 --> 22:10.377
I'll, um, explain later.

22:11.018 --> 22:14.630
Adrian, I'm producing
a new cop show in the fall.

22:14.665 --> 22:18.608
We're looking for a consultant to work
with the writers, keep us honest.

22:18.643 --> 22:22.622
The position is yours
if you want it. - Wow.

22:23.323 --> 22:24.743
Dwight, I don't know what to say.

22:24.778 --> 22:25.712
Why don't you say yes?

22:25.747 --> 22:28.889
Dad, that's really sweet, but
Adrian would never quit his job.

22:28.924 --> 22:31.357
It's his life.
Oh, you guys should see him.

22:31.392 --> 22:33.198
- He is so brilliant.
- Here we go.

22:33.233 --> 22:34.161
When he's at a crime scene,

22:34.196 --> 22:36.546
the other policemen, they just
stand back and watch him work.

22:36.581 --> 22:38.335
They watch me so
they know what not to do.

22:38.370 --> 22:40.291
Oh, you are so modest.

22:40.326 --> 22:44.213
Besides, we love San francisco.
I really can't see us ever leaving.

22:44.248 --> 22:45.867
It's so far away.

22:45.902 --> 22:48.441
Not the way Trudy drives.

22:48.476 --> 22:51.146
So you won't be moving back.

22:51.181 --> 22:55.263
Well, Adrian, you take
care of my little girl.

22:55.298 --> 22:58.962
- She's all we have.
- Yes, sir. I will.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.905
I'm so sorry.

23:10.540 --> 23:12.947
- About what?
- Wait a minute.

23:12.982 --> 23:14.989
Hold the phone.
I've got it.

23:15.024 --> 23:18.418
Got what? - How they're
cheating on the show.

23:18.453 --> 23:20.071
It's a code.

23:20.106 --> 23:24.535
Roddy Lankman is blinking
when he asks the questions.

23:24.570 --> 23:28.439
Like once for A, two for B.

23:28.474 --> 23:31.925
- That's what he does.
- No, no, no, no. I thought about that.

23:31.960 --> 23:35.112
I've studied every frame
from every show. It's impossible.

23:35.147 --> 23:38.239
He never blinks
or gestures or changes his voice,

23:38.274 --> 23:40.579
at least that I could tell.

23:40.614 --> 23:43.908
Well, you were there. Did you
notice anything? - No, no.

23:43.943 --> 23:46.484
But when can I talk
to this Mr. Lankman?

23:46.519 --> 23:49.285
I've already asked him.
He won't talk to you or anybody.

23:49.320 --> 23:52.364
These days, he hardly ever
leaves his trailer.

23:52.399 --> 23:54.448
Poor guy's had
a pretty tough year.

23:54.483 --> 23:56.187
What happened?

23:56.222 --> 23:58.489
Well, for one thing,
he's broke.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.314
He declared bankruptcy
last January.

24:00.349 --> 24:03.194
- And then there was the accident.
- What accident?

24:03.229 --> 24:07.223
Last month his personal assistant,
a girl named Lizzie Talvo, was killed.

24:07.258 --> 24:10.894
Her car went off the road
in Bluestone valley.

24:10.929 --> 24:13.918
- Roddy took it pretty hard.
- Bluestone valley?

24:13.953 --> 24:17.616
Val birch goes fishing
in Bluestone valley.

24:18.101 --> 24:21.812
They mentioned it on the show
when they introduced him.

24:22.938 --> 24:28.314
Val birch fishes...
where the girl was killed.

24:30.844 --> 24:33.614
He fishes where the girl was killed.

24:33.649 --> 24:36.024
That's probably important.

24:37.071 --> 24:39.398
Did you notice he said it twice?

24:50.743 --> 24:52.620
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

24:53.084 --> 24:56.139
- Why are you making that face?
- We're in rugged terrain.

24:56.174 --> 24:58.364
This is my rugged
terrain face. - Okay.

25:00.692 --> 25:04.345
Okay, she was,
she was traveling east.

25:04.380 --> 25:08.965
Her car went off the road
up there, ended up...

25:09.000 --> 25:11.398
right here between
these two rocks.

25:11.433 --> 25:14.804
- Haven't the police already been here?
- Well, that's true but...

25:15.420 --> 25:19.461
they weren't really looking for anything.
This wasn't a criminal investigation.

25:26.755 --> 25:28.243
What is it?

25:28.747 --> 25:30.385
Something?

25:33.230 --> 25:35.412
Something intended for Dwight Ellison.

25:39.737 --> 25:43.775
- An exercise tape.
- Did you bring those baggies?

25:44.901 --> 25:46.906
Oh, this is real evidence, isn't it?

25:46.941 --> 25:49.284
Oh, goodness.
I feel like a...

25:51.333 --> 25:54.454
- What's the matter? Are you okay?
- I just swallowed a bug.

25:54.489 --> 25:58.248
- You, you what?
- I'm okay. - - Oh, god.

26:10.922 --> 26:12.563
What is it?

26:20.903 --> 26:22.562
It's Val birch.

26:23.846 --> 26:25.221
He was here.

26:28.886 --> 26:30.806
Kevin? - It's okay.
I spit that one out.

26:30.841 --> 26:33.649
Oh, god. Just,
let's get out of here,

26:33.684 --> 26:36.403
and just, for god's sake,
cover your mouth. - Okay.

26:36.438 --> 26:37.816
It's just a videotape.

26:37.851 --> 26:40.229
"Thighs and abs: 10 minutes
a day to a perfect you."

26:40.264 --> 26:42.731
Does that mean anything to you?
Yeah, me neither.

26:42.766 --> 26:45.653
We're at Val birch's house now.
I want to have another word with him.

26:45.688 --> 26:48.289
No, I'll be fine.
Thanks. I appreciate that, Dwight.

26:52.370 --> 26:54.023
I don't think he's home.

26:58.046 --> 26:59.845
Hello, Mr. Birch?

26:59.880 --> 27:03.601
Hello, it's Adrian monk.
We spoke yesterday at the show.

27:04.157 --> 27:05.482
Mr. Birch?

27:05.517 --> 27:09.337
I'm here, too. Kevin dorfman.
I'm his upstairs neighbor.

27:15.361 --> 27:18.722
It looks unlocked?
What do you think?

27:18.757 --> 27:21.339
Well, we can't go in
without a reason.

27:22.943 --> 27:26.801
- I'm kind of thirsty. Does that count?
- No, Kevin.

27:26.836 --> 27:28.718
Thirst is no excuse for
breaking and entering.

27:28.753 --> 27:32.430
- Wouldn't it be cool if it was?
- Yes, that would be cool.

27:32.465 --> 27:34.668
Here. Let me...

27:34.703 --> 27:35.998
what are you doing?
What are you doing?

27:36.033 --> 27:39.146
I'm leaning in. Yeah, I went to
law school for three semesters.

27:39.181 --> 27:41.958
You can lean anywhere you want.
It's in the constitution.

27:43.003 --> 27:45.672
I can't imagine which constitution
you're referring to.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.957
You know what?
Grab my pants.

27:48.429 --> 27:51.199
Pardon me? - Grab my pants.
I need the counterweight.

27:51.234 --> 27:53.033
Kevin, I really don't
want to grab your pants.

27:53.986 --> 27:56.834
If I touch that floor,
it's a felony.

28:11.580 --> 28:13.172
Mr. Birch?

28:14.576 --> 28:17.743
Hello?
Mr. Birch?.

28:17.778 --> 28:19.794
Hello?

28:19.829 --> 28:23.403
Kevin, you see that pencil on the chair?
Can you reach that?

28:33.424 --> 28:37.182
- You got it?
- I got it. Pull me. Yes, I got it.

28:39.336 --> 28:42.684
Do you still have the pencil that
Roddy Lankman gave you yesterday?

28:42.719 --> 28:45.364
- The collectible.
- The collectible.

28:52.925 --> 28:56.998
- Kevin, do you have the pencil?
- I have the pencil.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.594
He was here.

29:02.465 --> 29:04.394
Roddy Lankman was here...

29:04.429 --> 29:05.675
but why?

29:05.710 --> 29:08.354
Maybe they were trying
to figure out how to cheat.

29:08.389 --> 29:10.016
Let's go.

29:12.483 --> 29:15.009
Hi, this is your old pal Val.

29:15.044 --> 29:17.257
Leave your message
when you hear the beep.

29:19.157 --> 29:20.459
He's checking his messages.

29:20.494 --> 29:25.077
You have one saved message.
May 2nd, 7:39 P. M.

29:25.112 --> 29:26.849
He's skipping that one.

29:26.884 --> 29:31.945
You have one new message.
Today, 10:15 A. M.

29:31.980 --> 29:34.841
Mr. Birch, this is Tony Forrest
at Southland mercedes.

29:34.876 --> 29:36.197
I have some good news for you.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.746
The new 640 you ordered
will be in tomorrow.

29:38.781 --> 29:40.946
I got it here in three weeks
just like I promised.

29:40.981 --> 29:42.982
Let me know when you
want to pick it up.

29:46.435 --> 29:49.739
He ordered a new Mercedes-Benz
four weeks ago.

29:50.314 --> 29:51.992
Before he went on the show.

29:52.027 --> 29:53.926
That's what I call confidence.
He knew he was going to win.

29:53.961 --> 29:57.484
If we can figure out how they're
cheating, we can nail them both.

29:57.519 --> 30:01.210
- I have to get closer.
- Closer?

30:01.245 --> 30:03.593
Yesterday we were
in the front row.

30:03.628 --> 30:05.706
You can't get much
closer than that.

30:08.447 --> 30:10.670
Please welcome to the show, Adrian monk.

30:28.601 --> 30:29.917
Welcome to the show, Adrian.

30:29.952 --> 30:31.893
Mr. E., You are not going to regret this.

30:31.928 --> 30:34.756
Is there anybody you'd
like to say hello to? - Yes.

30:35.272 --> 30:39.227
Okay, who would that be? - Sharona.
She's in New Jersey visiting her mother.

30:39.262 --> 30:42.617
Oh, that's very nice. How long have
you and Sharona been married?

30:42.938 --> 30:44.625
No, no, no.

30:44.660 --> 30:45.937
Uh, Sharona is my nurse.

30:45.972 --> 30:50.165
I was married, but my wife
Trudy was killed by a car bomb.

30:51.878 --> 30:53.449
Did he just say "car bomb"?

30:53.484 --> 30:58.197
Which is why I have devoted my life
to putting criminals behind bars,

30:58.232 --> 31:02.238
even famous, powerful men
who think they're above the law.

31:05.189 --> 31:08.004
Uh, I'm sure you do
a great job, too.

31:08.039 --> 31:11.772
- All right, who wants to...
- Dig for treasure?

31:11.807 --> 31:13.515
All right, Tanya, let's get
this game started.

31:13.550 --> 31:15.710
We're going to start out
with a $1,000 question.

31:17.424 --> 31:19.182
Where...

31:19.217 --> 31:21.051
Adrian.

31:21.987 --> 31:23.774
I'm sorry.

31:24.434 --> 31:28.253
Um, there was a smudge
on my buzzer thing.

31:28.288 --> 31:30.410
Well, I'm sorry, but according
to our rule book,

31:30.445 --> 31:32.212
you'll have to answer the question.

31:32.682 --> 31:34.559
Could you repeat the question, please?

31:34.594 --> 31:37.863
Yes, but unfortunately, only the
part that you've already heard,

31:37.898 --> 31:41.695
so... where?

31:42.593 --> 31:44.033
Where?

31:50.382 --> 31:51.896
Where?

31:54.109 --> 31:55.765
Once more, please.

31:56.648 --> 32:00.888
- Where?
- Where...

32:00.923 --> 32:03.688
you have 10 seconds.

32:05.514 --> 32:07.415
Constantinople.

32:07.450 --> 32:09.253
Well, we're a multiple choice show,

32:09.288 --> 32:11.550
so all we need is A, B, C, or D.

32:11.585 --> 32:14.849
- D.
- D?

32:14.884 --> 32:17.079
- No, B.
- B.

32:17.114 --> 32:18.922
B. B. Definitely B.

32:18.957 --> 32:22.912
- B, and that's your final answer.
- A.

32:23.833 --> 32:27.463
Uh, well, the correct answer
is C, Macy's.

32:28.478 --> 32:33.383
Moving on, let's go
to our $1,500 question.

32:34.929 --> 32:36.472
Oh, for the love of god.

32:36.507 --> 32:39.544
I'm sorry. It's still
a little grimy here.

32:41.094 --> 32:44.143
Time is money for some of us.

32:44.178 --> 32:45.645
Okay, I'll try.

32:45.680 --> 32:49.521
All right, moving
onto the $1,500 question...

33:04.919 --> 33:07.284
Okay. I'm done.

33:12.334 --> 33:16.632
That's it. - What element do you
add to iron to make steel?

33:16.667 --> 33:19.302
Is it A, aluminum, B, carbon,

33:19.337 --> 33:22.501
- C, lead, or...
- B, carbon.

33:22.536 --> 33:24.844
Carbon is correct for $1,500.

33:25.578 --> 33:27.349
They're still cheating.

33:28.097 --> 33:31.142
But why would they do that
with Adrian out there?

33:31.820 --> 33:33.453
They have no choice.

33:33.488 --> 33:35.630
- If Val loses today, he can't come back.
- What Greek city hosted

33:35.665 --> 33:37.154
- the original olympics?
- That's a good point.

33:37.189 --> 33:40.075
Was it A, Athens, B, Rhodes,

33:40.110 --> 33:43.031
- C, Olympia...
- C, Olympia.

33:43.066 --> 33:46.084
Correct again for $1,500.

33:49.738 --> 33:51.849
He figured it out.

33:51.884 --> 33:54.016
He knows how they're cheating.

34:01.571 --> 34:04.465
One minute. We are back in one.

34:06.114 --> 34:08.985
- So you figured it out?
- Yes, sir. I know how they're cheating.

34:09.021 --> 34:10.536
Was I right about
the blinking? - No.

34:10.572 --> 34:12.768
- Was I close?
- No.

34:12.804 --> 34:14.146
But it is a code.

34:14.181 --> 34:17.514
Lankman is holding the question
cards differently every time.

34:18.081 --> 34:21.004
If he holds it by this corner,
it means the answer is A.

34:21.039 --> 34:23.411
This corner means B,
and this one's for C.

34:23.446 --> 34:25.065
What do we do now?

34:26.469 --> 34:28.018
I guess we call the police.

34:28.054 --> 34:31.867
Hi, it's me. It's 7:15.
Call me when you get home.

34:31.902 --> 34:34.132
I love you.

34:41.974 --> 34:43.340
Dwight...

34:43.375 --> 34:45.487
Dwight!

34:45.523 --> 34:47.100
When did Lizzie Talvo die?

34:47.135 --> 34:48.851
- What was the date?
- May 2nd.

34:48.887 --> 34:50.382
May 2nd. About what time?

34:50.418 --> 34:54.398
- Evening, while the show was on.
- Around 7:39 P. M.?

34:54.433 --> 34:57.103
- That sounds about right.
- Don't call the police. Not yet.

34:57.139 --> 34:59.201
These men are guilty of
more than just cheating,

34:59.236 --> 35:00.849
and I think I can prove it.

35:00.884 --> 35:03.331
- You're going to prove it now?
- If I don't do it now,

35:03.366 --> 35:05.036
they might destroy the evidence.

35:05.071 --> 35:09.223
- 15 seconds! Places!
- I got to go. I got to go.

35:09.258 --> 35:11.973
Listen, isn't there a way to make
a phone call during the show?

35:12.008 --> 35:14.488
Well, you can phone a friend, but
only if you make it to the bonus round.

35:14.523 --> 35:16.421
Oh, you're so far behind.
You'll never make it.

35:16.456 --> 35:21.729
Five seconds!
4, 3, 2...

35:24.761 --> 35:27.379
Welcome back to "Treasure chest."
My name is Roddy Lankman,

35:27.414 --> 35:33.646
and our reigning champ Val birch
is in the lead again with $3,000.

35:33.681 --> 35:36.561
In second place, Susan with zero,

35:36.596 --> 35:39.223
and, Adrian, you're at negative $1,000.

35:39.258 --> 35:41.369
Well, Roddy, I think
my luck is about to change.

35:41.404 --> 35:45.246
Well, there's only one way to find out.
Let's do round two and dig for treasure.

35:45.281 --> 35:48.368
For $4,000, the bone that connects
your knee to your ankle is

35:48.403 --> 35:51.766
- the A, fibula, B, tibia...
- B, tibia.

35:52.583 --> 35:54.550
That is correct.

35:54.585 --> 35:56.218
Next question.

35:56.253 --> 35:58.588
How many square yards
in an acre? Is...

35:58.623 --> 35:59.558
C.

36:02.049 --> 36:05.754
Uh, C is correct.
It's 4,840 square yards.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.347
Lucky guess.

36:08.382 --> 36:11.354
A lucky guess indeed.
For $5,000...

36:11.389 --> 36:14.749
- D.
- D is correct.

36:14.784 --> 36:17.043
Another lucky guess.

36:17.078 --> 36:20.521
For $5,500, president Mckinley
was assassinated...

36:20.556 --> 36:23.390
- D./- B.
- D. The answer is D, Roddy.

36:23.425 --> 36:26.760
D is correct, yes.
Next question...

36:26.795 --> 36:28.914
- who...
- B, B, B, B, B.

36:28.949 --> 36:31.291
B is correct.
It's Jackson Browne.

36:31.326 --> 36:33.833
- Susan, are you okay?
- I, I just...

36:33.868 --> 36:36.395
it looked so much easier
when I was watching at home.

36:36.430 --> 36:38.253
Yes, it always looks easier at home.

36:38.288 --> 36:40.748
- For $6,000...
- C!

36:40.783 --> 36:42.857
- No, C is not right.
- A.

36:42.892 --> 36:45.071
A is correct. The wombat.

36:45.106 --> 36:47.728
And for the last question,
for $6,000,

36:47.763 --> 36:50.364
- what element...
- D.

36:52.182 --> 36:56.231
D is correct, and that's
the end of round two.

36:56.266 --> 36:58.813
A couple of very intelligent
gentlemen here.

36:58.848 --> 37:02.782
Uh, that means Adrian monk is
the winner of round two.

37:02.817 --> 37:06.690
Val birch, you're going to have
to sit this one out this time.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.749
Adrian, you understand
what happens in round two.

37:08.784 --> 37:10.456
You answer these five
questions correctly,

37:10.491 --> 37:11.763
and you not only win this game,

37:11.798 --> 37:15.051
but you win this great
big pot of gold!

37:18.904 --> 37:21.040
You know how we play our game.
You have five questions.

37:21.075 --> 37:22.883
Let's see how you do.

37:22.918 --> 37:26.761
Adrian, who was the first president
to win the nobel peace prize?

37:26.796 --> 37:30.071
Roddy, I understand
I can phone a friend.

37:30.778 --> 37:32.519
You want to phone a friend
on the first question.

37:32.554 --> 37:35.974
Well, you're the boss.
Tanya, let's bring him the phone.

37:36.441 --> 37:38.614
For those joining us
for the first time,

37:38.649 --> 37:40.823
Adrian is going to call a friend

37:40.858 --> 37:44.074
to see if he can get a little help on
this very important bonus round question.

37:44.109 --> 37:46.325
All right, who would you like to call?

37:47.785 --> 37:50.318
Well, Roddy, I would like to call...

37:50.353 --> 37:53.130
- him.
- Me?

37:53.165 --> 37:55.538
You want to call me?

37:55.983 --> 37:58.042
I don't think I'm at home.

38:01.773 --> 38:03.374
Well, Mr. Monk,
what are you doing?

38:03.409 --> 38:05.790
Do you know what he's doing?
Because I don't know what he's doing.

38:05.825 --> 38:11.108
I'm trying to prove that you
are guilty of murder, Mr. Lankman,

38:11.143 --> 38:14.478
or at the very least, manslaughter.

38:14.513 --> 38:16.591
Lizzie Talvo, your personal assistant,

38:16.626 --> 38:19.700
discovered that you were
cheating on the show.

38:20.948 --> 38:24.781
- Uh... can we go to a commercial?
- You do and you're fired.

38:24.816 --> 38:27.607
She died about a month ago
in a car crash,

38:27.642 --> 38:30.915
and this man has been
blackmailing you ever since,

38:30.950 --> 38:34.293
and you have been paying him off
here on your show

38:34.328 --> 38:36.700
by feeding him the answers.

38:38.224 --> 38:40.348
I knew it.
Do over.

38:40.383 --> 38:43.553
Mr. Birch, you were in Bluestone
valley the night she died.

38:46.683 --> 38:48.976
You must have seen the crash.

38:54.812 --> 38:58.159
She was still alive
when you got to the car.

38:59.155 --> 39:02.025
She had to have said something
to you before she died...

39:02.060 --> 39:04.773
something about Mr. Lankman.

39:04.808 --> 39:08.334
You must have realized
you just hit the jackpot.

39:08.369 --> 39:13.986
You called your own answering machine
and recorded her dying words.

39:14.021 --> 39:16.453
You can't prove any of this.

39:16.488 --> 39:17.838
I was at your house yesterday,

39:17.873 --> 39:20.965
and I happened to hear
the date and time stamp

39:21.000 --> 39:24.598
of a phone message that
you had saved...

39:24.633 --> 39:27.882
May 2nd, 7:39 P. M.

39:27.917 --> 39:31.690
I think I can prove it, sir.
What's your number?

39:31.725 --> 39:35.614
Adrian, it's 555-0137.

39:35.649 --> 39:37.265
Thank you, Dwight.

39:42.446 --> 39:44.969
Hi, this is your old pal Val.

39:45.004 --> 39:47.226
Leave your message
when you hear the beep.

39:51.697 --> 39:56.073
4, 8, 2.

39:56.108 --> 40:01.634
You have one saved message.
May 2nd, 7:39 P. M.

40:01.669 --> 40:05.634
It was Roddy.
It was Roddy Lankman.

40:05.669 --> 40:07.891
He was cheating on the show.

40:07.926 --> 40:10.525
I was going to blow the whistle.

40:10.560 --> 40:13.376
He cut my brakes.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.128
Roddy.

40:16.139 --> 40:17.644
Mr. Lankman, Mr. Birch,

40:17.679 --> 40:19.860
some homicide detectives
are outside.

40:19.895 --> 40:21.447
They want to talk to you.

40:32.569 --> 40:33.868
Adrian.

40:38.826 --> 40:40.582
You were amazing.

40:42.255 --> 40:44.413
Just like Trudy always said.

40:46.921 --> 40:48.811
Thank you for this.

40:50.157 --> 40:52.380
Thank you for Trudy.

41:53.316 --> 41:56.911
Monday.
Dear diary, it is a terrible day.

41:56.946 --> 41:59.093
Ginger died this morning.

41:59.128 --> 42:02.026
I was too sad to go to
school or even eat.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.511
I cried all day.

42:03.546 --> 42:05.910
I will never be happy again.

42:06.708 --> 42:08.043
Friday.

42:08.078 --> 42:09.749
Tomorrow I'm going to camp.

42:09.784 --> 42:11.703
I have been packing all day.

42:11.738 --> 42:13.629
It's going to be so much fun.

42:13.664 --> 42:15.387
I can't wait.

42:15.422 --> 42:17.635
I still think about Ginger sometimes,

42:17.670 --> 42:20.024
but now I just remember the good times.

42:20.059 --> 42:21.888
I guess daddy was right.

42:21.923 --> 42:24.014
God wants people to be happy.

42:24.049 --> 42:26.604
Nobody can stay sad forever.
