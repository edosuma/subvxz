CEREAL CRACKLES

00:08.999 --> 00:10.800
<font color="#FFFF00"> Can you hear them?</font>

00:10.801 --> 00:11.998
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, yes.</font>

00:11.999 --> 00:13.998
<font color="#FFFF00"> Snap, crackle and pop.</font>

00:13.999 --> 00:16.998
<font color="#11FF11"> They sounds like tiny people.</font>

00:16.999 --> 00:20.998
<font color="#11FF11"> Plip-plip-plip-plip-plip!
"Help me, I can't swim!"</font>

00:20.999 --> 00:22.998
Guys, do you mind?

00:22.999 --> 00:23.999
<font color="#FFFF00"> What are they doing?</font>

00:24.000 --> 00:26.399
Talking about the cereal.
GRUNTING

00:26.400 --> 00:29.800
<font color="#11FF11"> Red man! Red man!
Red man! Red man!</font>

00:29.801 --> 00:31.998
<font color="#FFFF00"> Postman's coming. </font>How do you...? Oh!</font>

00:31.999 --> 00:34.266
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'll go with you. # Friends together</font>

00:34.267 --> 00:36.000
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Fetch the post together... #</font>

00:38.999 --> 00:41.998
<font color="#FFFF00"> Cornflakes were actually invented</font>

00:41.999 --> 00:45.800
<font color="#FFFF00"> to stop people from
touching themselves, apparently.</font>

00:45.801 --> 00:47.266
<font color="#00FFFF"> Never did like cornflakes.</font>

00:47.267 --> 00:49.933
<font color="#11FF11"> Give me an egg atop a cutlet
any day of the diary.</font>

SCREAMS: </font>Ooh!</font>

00:50.999 --> 00:53.266
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#11FF11"> Toaster. </font>Yes, I know,
I wasn't scared.</font>

00:53.267 --> 00:54.998
<font color="#00FFFF"> # Let me read the post... #</font>

00:54.999 --> 00:57.800
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's so exciting
reading one's correspondences.</font>

00:57.801 --> 00:59.266

admirers.</font>

Michael! <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Anything interesting?</font>

ALISON: Yeah, I mean,
it really is an incredible place.

01:47.002 --> 01:49.734
The building itself is 15th-century.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.199
<font color="#FFFF00"> Wow.</font>

01:51.200 --> 01:53.867
1469, to be precise.

01:53.868 --> 01:55.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Very good.</font>

01:55.200 --> 01:56.600
<font color="#00FFFF"> But the facade is actually mid-16th.</font>

01:56.601 --> 01:58.199
But the facade is actually mid-16th.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.200
<font color="#00FFFF"> 'Tis the finest house in the county.</font>

02:01.199 --> 02:05.199
<font color="#00FFFF"> Tell her it's the finest house
in the county. </font>I don't want to...

02:05.201 --> 02:08.199
..blow our own trumpet,

02:08.199 --> 02:11.505
but some people say that it is the
finest house in the county.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.506
Shall we go inside?

02:13.507 --> 02:15.506
<font color="#11FF11"> I'm telling you, this is a bad idea.</font>

02:15.507 --> 02:18.174
<font color="#11FF11"> Actors lounging about the house,</font>

02:18.175 --> 02:20.506
<font color="#11FF11"> learning lines, wearing make-up,</font>

02:20.507 --> 02:24.507
<font color="#11FF11"> prancing about the place in
loincloths, topless, oiled up.</font>

02:24.508 --> 02:29.441
<font color="#11FF11">Kissing each other probably.</font> <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Oh,
gosh! </font>I don't think it's that kind
of film, mate!</font>

02:29.442 --> 02:31.441
This was the banqueting hall.

02:31.442 --> 02:34.507
<font color="#FFFF00">Great space.</font> <font color="#11FF11"> Boo! </font>Oh! Agh!

02:35.908 --> 02:38.506
Oh, I forgot to take out the bins.

02:38.507 --> 02:41.506
Anyway, what could I tell you
about this room?

02:41.507 --> 02:43.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> Henry VIII actually dined here.</font>

02:43.507 --> 02:45.506
Wow! Henry VIII actually dined here.

02:45.507 --> 02:47.506
Sorry, did I say "wow"?

02:47.507 --> 02:49.640
I'm just still amazed by that.

02:49.641 --> 02:51.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> No, it is wow. </font>Yeah.

02:51.507 --> 02:54.907
<font color="#11FF11"> Yeah, you should've seen the
banquet. He had swan.</font>

02:54.908 --> 02:58.506
<font color="#ffffff">He had swan. </font>And hog. And hog. </font>And
dumplings. <span tts: color="white <font color="#11FF11"> And dumplings. </font>And figs.</font>

02:58.507 --> 03:00.907
<font color="#11FF11"> And figs. </font>Absolutely stank out the
privy.</font>

03:00.908 --> 03:04.506
And absolutely... loved the place.
Absolutely loved it.

03:04.507 --> 03:06.506
As do we!

03:06.507 --> 03:08.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> MIKE: </font>Hmm. Shall we move on?</font>

03:08.507 --> 03:10.506
<font color="#11FF11"> Er, give us a lift?</font>

03:10.507 --> 03:11.507
<font color="#11FF11"> Mate?</font>
HE SIGHS

03:11.508 --> 03:13.507
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#11FF11"> OK. </font>Thank you. Yay!</font>

03:15.507 --> 03:16.507
<font color="#00FFFF"> What's the programme, then?</font>

03:16.508 --> 03:17.508
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's a period drama.</font>

03:17.509 --> 03:20.640
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, what period?</font> <font color="#11FF11">Stuart!</font> <font color="#FFFF00"> Tudor!</font>
Regency!

03:20.641 --> 03:23.041
<font color="#00FFFF"> Regency. </font>Yes!
THUD!

03:23.042 --> 03:25.506
Sorry! Got carried away!

03:25.507 --> 03:27.506
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, there you are!</font>

03:27.507 --> 03:28.507
<font color="#11FF11"> Are you a sight for sore...?</font>

03:28.508 --> 03:30.507
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, you are kidding me?</font>

03:31.507 --> 03:36.640
<font color="#11FF11"> When I have control of the hands,
I am going to punch you so hard.</font>

03:36.641 --> 03:40.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> I think this place is perfect,
if you'd be willing to have us here
for a couple of months.</font>

03:40.507 --> 03:42.506
How much would you be offering?

03:42.507 --> 03:45.308
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> 3,000. </font>We'd have to sleep on it.</font>

03:45.309 --> 03:47.506
3,000 a day is the most we can
offer. <font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> A day?!</font>

03:47.507 --> 03:49.506
SHE SNORES
Morning! I've just slept on it

03:49.507 --> 03:51.506
<font color="#ffffff">and I say yes! </font>And it's a yes from
me! <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Great!</font>

03:51.507 --> 03:53.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> Just to warn you, though,
it is quite intrusive.</font>

03:53.507 --> 03:55.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> Lots of personnel. </font>Sounds fun.</font>

03:55.507 --> 03:57.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> It can feel like you're not welcome
in your own home.</font>

03:57.507 --> 03:59.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> Absolutely outrageous.</font>
We're used to that.

03:59.507 --> 04:02.507
<font color="#00FFFF">We've had building work going on.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00"> Is there anything structural
we should know about?</font>

04:02.508 --> 04:04.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, the floor in this room...</font>
No, no, no!</font>

04:04.507 --> 04:06.506
No, there's nothing structural.

04:06.507 --> 04:09.506
Everything's structurally
sound as a pound!

04:09.507 --> 04:10.507
TIMBERS CREAK

04:10.508 --> 04:13.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> We were looking at a property
in the next village,
but they're a big family</font>

04:13.507 --> 04:15.507
<font color="#FFFF00"> and they had some issues about
which rooms we could use.</font>

04:15.508 --> 04:19.308
Well, we're easy. You can film
wherever you like, when you like.

04:19.309 --> 04:20.505
<font color="#00FFFF"> Cos it's just the two of us.</font>

04:20.507 --> 04:22.507
Yeah...

04:27.507 --> 04:29.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> CAPTAIN: </font>Oh, here they come. The
riff-raff.</font>

04:29.507 --> 04:31.507
<font color="#00FFFF"> The lags. This will be chaos.</font>

04:36.042 --> 04:37.507
<font color="#00FFFF"> Hm.</font>

04:41.507 --> 04:43.507
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Morning. </font>Mind your backs!</font>

04:47.507 --> 04:50.175
<font color="#00FFFF"> ADs on channel 2, please.</font>

04:52.507 --> 04:54.506
<font color="#11FF11"> LADY BUTTON: </font>Well, I'm keeping out
of it.</font>

04:54.507 --> 04:58.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yes, though I might just,
erm... check.</font>

04:58.507 --> 05:00.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah.</font>
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

05:00.507 --> 05:02.506
<font color="#11FF11"> Hm.</font>

05:02.507 --> 05:04.042
<font color="#00FFFF"> Um...</font>
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

05:06.507 --> 05:08.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, that looks absolutely lovely,
that, doesn't it?</font>

05:08.507 --> 05:10.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> You going to put an egg on it?</font>

05:10.507 --> 05:12.640
<font color="#FFFF00"> He's put an egg on it!</font>
HE CHUCKLES

05:12.641 --> 05:17.174
Can I have some veggie sausages,
please? <font color="#FFFF00">No. </font>On a roll. <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> No.</font>

05:17.175 --> 05:18.308
<font color="#FFFF00"> Disgusting.</font>

05:18.309 --> 05:22.506
<font color="#11FF11"> You be beautiful wigs
that I ever did s...</font>

05:22.507 --> 05:25.506
<font color="#11FF11"> Ooh!</font>
SHE RETCHES

05:25.507 --> 05:28.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> Have you left your tongs on, Tina?</font>

05:28.507 --> 05:30.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> Is this meant to be 1820s?</font>

05:30.507 --> 05:32.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> Those are Rococo chairs and tables.</font>

05:32.507 --> 05:34.507
<font color="#FFFF00"> You can tell by the legs.
They're Rococo legs.</font>

05:35.507 --> 05:38.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> Hi, I'm Adam,
I'm the first assistant director.</font>

05:38.507 --> 05:39.640
<font color="#ffffff">Nice to meet you, hi.</font> <font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Hi. </font>Mike.</font>

05:39.641 --> 05:43.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> Sorry... What do you mean,
he's still in make-up?</font>

05:43.507 --> 05:45.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> We're not meant to have more than
15 people on this floor,</font>

05:45.507 --> 05:47.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> and some of these things weigh as
much as people, so that's...</font>

05:47.507 --> 05:49.506
It'll be fine.
I'm sure that's an exaggeration.

05:49.507 --> 05:50.640
<font color="#00FFFF"> But the survey said...</font>

05:50.641 --> 05:53.506
Yeah, the survey also said that we
need to replace the drains,

05:53.507 --> 05:55.506
and we need this money to do that.

05:55.507 --> 05:57.507
There aren't that many people,
anyway.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.506
As long as there isn't anything
that's too heavy.

06:01.507 --> 06:02.507
<font color="#11FF11"> Mind your backs!</font>

06:02.508 --> 06:06.506
OK! You can store this in the other
room, actually.

06:06.507 --> 06:08.174
It's easier for you then, isn't it?

06:08.175 --> 06:10.506
Just keep things a bit more
uncluttered in here.

06:10.507 --> 06:14.506
<font color="#11FF11"> The room just along there. </font>Can we
just...? Er...</font>

06:14.507 --> 06:16.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> Little horse go clippy-clippy-clop.</font>

06:16.507 --> 06:18.507
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, I see. Oh, hey!</font>

06:19.908 --> 06:21.507
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> No! </font>What a business!</font>

06:24.507 --> 06:27.507
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, you done it now, man.</font>

06:27.508 --> 06:31.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> I suppose we should call it a day...
Hello to you, sir!</font>

06:31.507 --> 06:33.506
HE CHUCKLES

06:33.507 --> 06:35.507
<font color="#FFFF00"> The gee-gees, come on, then.
Let's have a bit of this.</font>

06:35.508 --> 06:37.507
<font color="#FFFF00"> Come on.</font>

06:38.507 --> 06:40.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> HE STRAINS WITH EFFORT</font>
OK.</font>

06:40.507 --> 06:42.507
<font color="#00FFFF"> That's an arrival on Toby.
Just stepping out of the car.</font>

06:52.442 --> 06:53.507
Oh, my God.

06:53.508 --> 06:56.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> Who is that? </font>Toby Nightingale.

06:56.507 --> 06:58.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> He is... </font>Hot, right?

06:58.507 --> 07:00.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's certainly a lot of layers.</font>

07:00.507 --> 07:05.441
<font color="#11FF11"> No, Kitty, she means to say
she's in love with him.</font>

07:05.442 --> 07:06.506
<font color="#11FF11"> A knife in my heart!</font>

07:06.507 --> 07:08.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> Look at all his servants.</font>

07:08.507 --> 07:10.506
<font color="#11FF11"> He looks preposterous.</font>

07:10.507 --> 07:12.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> Nine, ten...</font>

07:12.507 --> 07:14.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> He counts as two.</font>

07:14.507 --> 07:15.508
<font color="#FFFF00"> What are you...?</font>

07:17.641 --> 07:19.640
<font color="#FFFF00"> Ah.</font>

07:19.641 --> 07:22.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> Oh, no. </font>Everything OK?</font>

07:22.507 --> 07:24.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> No. Yeah. Everything's fine.</font>

07:24.507 --> 07:27.506
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's just Toby Nightingale,
that's her free pass.</font>

07:27.507 --> 07:29.506
<font color="#11FF11"> Free pass? Oh, right!</font>

07:29.507 --> 07:30.507
<font color="#11FF11"> Ha! Don't let him hear that.</font>

07:30.508 --> 07:33.507
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, I won't. I definitely won't.</font>

07:38.507 --> 07:40.308
<font color="#11FF11"> Julian! I say, Julian!</font>

07:40.309 --> 07:42.308
<font color="#00FFFF"> What do you want? I'm terribly busy.</font>

07:42.309 --> 07:45.174
<font color="#11FF11"> You wouldn't happen to know what
a "free pass" means?</font>

07:45.175 --> 07:46.506
<font color="#11FF11"> Something Michael said.</font>

07:46.507 --> 07:48.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, yes. Samantha Fox was mine.</font>

07:48.507 --> 07:51.308
<font color="#00FFFF"> I do hope she's still modelling.
Very talented lady.</font>

07:51.309 --> 07:53.174
<font color="#11FF11"> Alison's is this actor fellow.</font>

07:53.175 --> 07:54.640
<font color="#11FF11"> What does it mean?</font>

07:54.641 --> 07:57.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, it's a sort of clause
in a marriage contract.</font>

07:57.507 --> 08:01.441
<font color="#00FFFF"> A named exception to the rule of
monogamy.</font>

08:01.442 --> 08:03.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> Sometimes there's a whole list of
people</font>

08:03.507 --> 08:06.507
<font color="#00FFFF"> with whom one can enter into
congress without consequences.</font>

08:06.508 --> 08:09.774
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#00FFFF"> My God! </font>Margot had three of the
Gladiators on her list -</font>

08:09.775 --> 08:13.308
<font color="#00FFFF"> Wolf, Cobra and John Fashanu.</font>

08:13.309 --> 08:17.506
<font color="#11FF11"> You mean to say that this player,
this minstrel,</font>

08:17.507 --> 08:20.506
<font color="#11FF11"> is allowed to bed fair Alison?</font>

08:20.507 --> 08:22.507
<font color="#00FFFF"> He's her free pass.</font>

08:28.507 --> 08:32.506

08:36.506 --> 08:40.506
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh! No, that's not a cow, Mary, no.
That's called a camera.</font>

08:40.506 --> 08:42.907
<font color="#11FF11"> Yes. They're just cleaning the lens.</font>

08:42.908 --> 08:45.308
<font color="#00FFFF"> Is that its mouth?</font>

08:45.309 --> 08:48.506

08:55.175 --> 08:58.041
What? No, no, no,
I just wanted to, erm, you know?

08:58.042 --> 08:59.907

A letter for you, Lord Byron, sir.

10:09.507 --> 10:11.441

10:11.442 --> 10:15.506

<font color="#11FF11"> Byron? Did he say Byron?</font>

10:15.507 --> 10:17.308

Taller, if anything.

10:50.507 --> 10:52.506
<font color="#00FFFF"> I wish I could see his calves.</font>

10:52.507 --> 10:55.308
<font color="#00FFFF"> I bet he's got lovely calves.</font>

10:55.309 --> 10:57.506
Well, I thought that was rather
good. <font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#11FF11"> No good for me.</font>

10:57.507 --> 10:59.506

I'm on it.

11:02.175 --> 11:05.506

That's what I said.</font>

11:22.507 --> 11:25.308
<font color="#FFFF00"> You can't bet, you're dead.</font>
All right, don't rub it in.</font>

11:25.309 --> 11:27.041

a pretty little dress.</font>
