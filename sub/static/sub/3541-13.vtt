- <i>Previously on</i> Vampire Diaries <i>:</i>
- Vampires and werewolves roamed free...

00:05.438 --> 00:07.736
...until a shaman put a curse on them.

00:07.907 --> 00:11.343
Werewolves can only turn on a full moon,
vampires are weakened by the sun.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.172
- Elijah.
- One of the Originals.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.779
- A legend.
- Klaus is the real deal.

00:14.948 --> 00:18.850
You're saying the oldest vampire in
the history of time is coming after me?

00:19.019 --> 00:20.953
- I offer you a deal.
- What kind of deal?

00:21.121 --> 00:24.989
Stay put and stop trying to get killed.
Your friends remain unharmed.

00:25.158 --> 00:26.648
- I called Isobel.
- Did you find her?

00:26.826 --> 00:28.487
Not exactly.

00:28.661 --> 00:30.424
- Hello, Elena.
- Uncle John.

00:30.597 --> 00:35.057
A bite from a werewolf can kill a vampire,
so don't be his friend. You understand?

00:36.436 --> 00:38.870
I'm Jules.
I know you're a werewolf.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.973
- Do you know where Mason is?
- He's dead.

00:41.141 --> 00:43.871
You wanna know who murdered him?
Your blond vampire did.

00:44.044 --> 00:47.343
- Caroline would never do that.
- She and her friends were behind it.

00:56.122 --> 00:57.680
Hey.

00:59.926 --> 01:01.052
How's it going?

01:01.661 --> 01:03.151
We need to talk.

01:03.863 --> 01:05.558
Yeah, we do.

01:06.466 --> 01:11.529
Listen, I've been thinking about it,
and I don't wanna overanalyze.

01:12.372 --> 01:15.432
Yeah, it was just one kiss...

01:15.642 --> 01:18.577
...but Matt's still kind of
in the picture.

01:19.879 --> 01:22.712
We can't go there, Tyler.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.014
Fine.

01:27.487 --> 01:29.079
Great.

01:29.956 --> 01:31.446
That's settled.

01:34.561 --> 01:36.188
What happened to my Uncle Mason?

01:39.332 --> 01:40.390
- What?
- He's dead.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.467
And I want you to tell me
what happened.

01:45.271 --> 01:49.037
- Uh, Tyler, I don't...
- Then let me tell you.

01:49.909 --> 01:52.275
Stefan and his brother Damon
killed him...

01:52.712 --> 01:55.044
...because Stefan and Damon
are vampires...

01:55.215 --> 01:56.477
...just like you.

01:58.985 --> 02:01.545
- Who told you that?
- Is it true?

02:02.288 --> 02:03.380
Let me explain.

02:03.556 --> 02:05.751
Did you know he was dead
this whole time?

02:05.925 --> 02:07.552
- Please.
- Did you know?

02:14.067 --> 02:17.298
- I'm sorry, Tyler. I'm sorry.
- I trusted you.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.293
<i>The sheriff's department believes drugs...</i>

02:42.462 --> 02:45.397
<i>...played a part in the assailant's</i>
<i>deranged and violent behavior...</i>

02:45.565 --> 02:49.558
<i>...that left three dead at last night's</i>
<i>Booster Club dinner at a high school.</i>

02:49.903 --> 02:52.770
<i>Authorities believe last night's assailant</i>
<i>may be linked...</i>

02:52.939 --> 02:56.397
<i>...to the missing campers and</i>
<i>park ranger who have yet to be found...</i>

02:56.576 --> 03:00.637
<i>...as well as Jessica Koenig,</i>
<i>reported missing this morning.</i>

03:00.813 --> 03:03.782
<i>The sheriff's department says</i>
<i>investigations are pending...</i>

03:03.950 --> 03:05.918
<i>...and no further comment</i>
<i>will be made.</i>

03:06.085 --> 03:08.645
<i>In related news,</i>
<i>Mayor Lockwood spoke earlier today.</i>

03:08.821 --> 03:11.654
<i>Due to the recent tragedies</i>
<i>that have plagued our town...</i>

03:11.824 --> 03:16.625
<i>...we will be holding a memorial in</i>
<i>Town Square to honor all we have lost.</i>

03:16.796 --> 03:20.630
<i>Join us in hopes that, as a community,</i>
<i>we can begin to heal.</i>

03:20.800 --> 03:22.961
- Morning.
- What are you doing here?

03:23.603 --> 03:25.127
- Coffee?
- We're not doing that.

03:25.305 --> 03:28.638
We did that last night. No more avoiding.
Why are you here?

03:28.975 --> 03:31.876
I'm here to protect you.
That's all I can say for the moment.

03:32.078 --> 03:35.809
- What do you mean that's all?
- I'll tell you more when I can trust you.

03:35.982 --> 03:37.506
Oh, God, I'm late.

03:37.684 --> 03:40.778
- That's what you get for hitting snooze.
- What the hell?

03:40.954 --> 03:43.616
Good morning to you, Jenna, Alaric.

03:45.024 --> 03:49.017
It's okay I'm confused, right? Because
we were not expecting you, like, ever.

03:49.195 --> 03:52.289
Well, I got in late last night.
Elena let me in.

03:53.533 --> 03:56.093
You know,
I'm, uh, probably just gonna take off.

04:03.543 --> 04:04.567
I'm still confused here.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.508
- I decided to come back and stay a while.
- Not here.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.841
Actually, you can't stop me
from living here.

04:10.016 --> 04:12.678
Actually, I can. As legal guardian.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.410
Yeah, about that.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.214
Um, you want me to explain
the situation...

04:17.390 --> 04:20.483
...or would you like to do the honors?
- What's going on?

04:20.660 --> 04:23.424
I'm sorry, Jenna.
I should have told you earlier but...

04:25.031 --> 04:27.056
I'm Elena's biological father.

04:29.135 --> 04:30.329
There.

04:30.503 --> 04:32.027
Now you know.

04:40.813 --> 04:42.110
What?

04:42.282 --> 04:43.874
You brought back John Gilbert?

04:44.050 --> 04:48.214
- That was your big "save Elena" move?
- I went to look for Isobel and got John.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.879
He said he could help us
and we're desperate.

04:51.057 --> 04:53.924
We're not that desperate.
The guy tried to barbecue me.

04:54.093 --> 04:56.584
Damon, Bonnie's witch friend
is working with Elijah.

04:56.763 --> 04:59.254
We have to assume the moonstone
was never destroyed.

04:59.432 --> 05:02.629
Elena is putting all of her faith
into some deal...

05:02.802 --> 05:04.963
...that she made with Elijah
to keep everyone safe.

05:06.339 --> 05:09.433
Do you trust Elijah? I don't trust him.
He's an Original. He can't be trusted.

05:09.609 --> 05:13.067
It's not like we could go and kill him
because apparently he can't die.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.544
Waiting for the part
where John's the answer.

05:15.715 --> 05:18.548
He knew about the sacrifice.
Isobel told him.

05:18.718 --> 05:21.312
He said he knew of a way
to keep Elena safe.

05:22.622 --> 05:25.318
- And how do we do that?
- He's not talking.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.288
At least not to me, anyway.

05:28.561 --> 05:33.123
Great work, Stefan, topnotch.
As if I didn't have enough problems.

05:35.301 --> 05:36.791
Hey, I'm sorry about Rose.

05:36.969 --> 05:40.336
Whatever. I knew the woman
for five minutes.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.168
And you cared about her
after five minutes.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.174
Oh, I wonder what that means.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.937
It means I care, Stefan.

05:47.313 --> 05:52.307
It means I'm changing and evolving
into a man capable of greatness.

05:53.653 --> 05:54.915
Better watch your back...

05:55.922 --> 05:58.686
...because I may have to go get
a hero hairdo of my own...

05:58.858 --> 06:00.951
...and steal your thunder.

06:12.505 --> 06:14.097
I got it, Mom.

06:20.646 --> 06:22.546
- What's wrong?
- Tyler knows about you.

06:22.749 --> 06:25.980
He knows that Damon killed Mason.
I didn't say a word.

06:26.152 --> 06:28.313
It's that Jules.
She had a run-in with Damon.

06:28.488 --> 06:31.218
Tyler was so upset.
The look on his face...

06:31.391 --> 06:33.450
...he was so betrayed.
- Wow, this is bad.

06:33.626 --> 06:36.356
- You're not gonna tell Damon?
- No. He wants to kill him.

06:36.529 --> 06:39.123
He thinks all werewolves should die.
He's not wrong.

06:39.298 --> 06:42.734
What if Tyler tries to retaliate?
He has every right. He can get killed.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.871
We're not gonna let that happen.
We have to get to him...

06:46.038 --> 06:48.871
...and reason with him
before he does something stupid.

06:49.041 --> 06:52.499
You have to talk to him.
Just try to explain.

06:52.678 --> 06:56.774
You know, you always know
the right things to say. Okay, he and I...

06:58.151 --> 06:59.982
...we're friends.

07:00.720 --> 07:03.416
<i>I was right, wasn't I?</i>

07:04.290 --> 07:07.726
Your little vampire friend,
she was lying.

07:08.795 --> 07:10.592
What do you want?

07:11.297 --> 07:15.825
I want you to understand
that a vampire will never be your friend.

07:16.002 --> 07:18.163
It's our nature to be enemies.

07:18.738 --> 07:22.902
- You know how stupid that sounds?
- You need to leave here. It's not safe.

07:23.075 --> 07:26.374
I can't just run away with you.
I don't even know you.

07:26.679 --> 07:28.169
My mom would freak.

07:29.415 --> 07:32.009
- My life is here.
- Your old life.

07:32.819 --> 07:35.754
Your new life is just beginning.

07:36.556 --> 07:39.753
- You have so much to learn.
- Like what?

07:40.560 --> 07:43.723
How to survive.
You've triggered the curse, Tyler.

07:43.896 --> 07:47.696
It's important you learn
what it means to be a lycanthrope.

07:47.934 --> 07:51.461
We live by a code of loyalty.
We take care of each other.

07:52.071 --> 07:54.301
It's my duty and honor to help you.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.738
Please let me.

08:00.746 --> 08:02.611
- Where's John?
- He's not here.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.074
He left. I don't know where he went.

08:05.251 --> 08:09.483
He just blew in, announced to Jenna
that he's my dad and then took off.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.419
- That's public knowledge now?
- Apparently.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.758
- You okay?
- Yeah.

08:17.129 --> 08:19.597
Jenna's head is spinning
but I'm okay.

08:19.765 --> 08:22.290
- He say what he was doing here?
- No.

08:22.468 --> 08:25.801
Stefan thinks that he's telling the truth
about wanting to help me.

08:26.172 --> 08:29.107
- You believe him?
- No, I don't believe him for a second.

08:29.275 --> 08:30.503
I don't either.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.905
- What are we gonna do?
- Kill him.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.178
- Damon.
- I'm joking.

08:36.749 --> 08:38.409
Okay, I'm a little serious.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.643
- Damon.
- I'm not gonna hurt him, Elena.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.817
I'm the good guy now, remember?

08:44.891 --> 08:47.792
- What does that mean?
- I'm gonna have a civil conversation...

08:47.960 --> 08:49.621
...with your father.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.963
Wait, I'm coming with you.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.979
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just wanna talk.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.146
- Then why did you break in?
- Would you have let me in?

09:15.655 --> 09:17.213
Tyler?

09:21.027 --> 09:23.655
- Shh. Not a word.
- Tyler?

09:23.829 --> 09:26.127
I'm leaving for the memorial.

09:45.051 --> 09:46.746
Brady?

10:00.666 --> 10:04.227
- This was a hard place to find.
- You told me to stay under the radar.

10:04.537 --> 10:07.506
- Thanks for coming.
- You sure these vamps killed Mason?

10:07.673 --> 10:10.801
Positive. We have to be careful.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.709
I'm not afraid of a vampire.

10:15.481 --> 10:20.578
I know, baby, but I want the boy
more than I want vengeance.

10:22.788 --> 10:26.383
I say, let's get both.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.441
Maybe we're getting off
on the wrong foot here.

10:44.176 --> 10:45.268
What happened to Mason?

10:48.748 --> 10:50.807
Tyler, there's a lot
for us to talk about.

10:52.184 --> 10:55.745
I wouldn't do that. Without a full moon,
you're no match for me.

11:00.059 --> 11:03.153
It's good to have you back, John.
We could really use you.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.559
And the Council? What are they doing?

11:06.132 --> 11:08.623
Damon Salvatore
is leading the council now.

11:11.070 --> 11:12.697
Talk to him.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.068
Excuse me.

11:15.307 --> 11:16.399
Sorry.

11:17.443 --> 11:19.468
Jeremy. There you are.

11:19.779 --> 11:21.770
Looks like I slept
through the homecoming.

11:21.947 --> 11:23.278
You didn't miss much.

11:23.449 --> 11:25.940
To say no one's happy to see me
is an understatement.

11:26.118 --> 11:27.312
Things are different now.

11:27.486 --> 11:30.614
You can't come around and start
with all this anti-vampire stuff.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.281
I have no intention of doing that.

11:33.459 --> 11:34.983
How's that ring been treating you?

11:37.096 --> 11:40.793
Look, if this is what you came for,
just take it and go.

11:41.934 --> 11:44.960
What kind of man would I be
if I took that from you?

11:46.872 --> 11:49.102
- Wanna go grab some lunch?
- I think I'll pass.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.688
Hello, Bonnie.

12:07.860 --> 12:12.524
I don't have anything to say to you,
Dr. Martin. Or your son.

12:12.698 --> 12:16.896
- You must be feeling confused about us.
- There's nothing confusing about it.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.799
I trusted Luka and he betrayed me.

12:19.972 --> 12:23.908
Elena told me you're both working
for Elijah, so don't lie about it.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.566
I won't.

12:25.778 --> 12:28.906
But that doesn't mean
we're not also looking out for you.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.912
Spare me the witch-Ioyalty crap.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.849
You might not wanna believe this,
but Elijah is a man of his word.

12:35.020 --> 12:37.545
You can trust
he'll keep his end of the deal...

12:37.723 --> 12:40.715
...to keep you
and your friends protected.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.191
You're right. I don't believe it.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.229
Is there a problem here?

12:49.034 --> 12:50.899
Not at all.

12:52.538 --> 12:56.235
- What was that about?
- Just more lies.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.610
I can't believe it.

13:03.816 --> 13:07.217
Elena is my sister's husband's
brother's daughter...

13:07.386 --> 13:10.355
...and her mother
is my boyfriend's deceased wife.

13:10.523 --> 13:14.857
- You can't make this stuff up.
- It's, uh, definitely a little overwhelming.

13:15.027 --> 13:17.461
I can't believe
that they kept it a secret.

13:18.063 --> 13:21.590
How it is even possible
to keep a secret like that?

13:28.274 --> 13:33.405
Hey, you two.
You think I can, um, join you?

13:33.579 --> 13:36.275
- Do you have to?
- I guess I don't have to...

13:36.448 --> 13:37.608
...but might as well.

13:39.418 --> 13:40.749
Look who's here.

13:41.487 --> 13:44.081
We just need answers.
Please don't do anything stupid.

13:44.256 --> 13:46.747
Yeah, but stupid's so much more fun.

13:46.926 --> 13:50.726
Damon, I mean it. All I'm asking is
you try to keep it together.

13:50.896 --> 13:52.124
Be the better man.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.366
Okay then.

13:59.071 --> 14:01.266
John, buddy.

14:02.174 --> 14:05.439
- How have you been?
- I've been all right, Damon.

14:05.878 --> 14:06.936
It's good to see you.

14:10.015 --> 14:13.007
Look, about Caroline,
no matter what her flaws are...

14:13.185 --> 14:16.120
...when push comes to shove,
you want that girl on your side.

14:16.288 --> 14:18.654
She's your friend.
Stop being a dick to her.

14:18.824 --> 14:20.587
I thought vampires hated werewolves.

14:20.759 --> 14:23.125
That's some leftover idea
from another time.

14:23.295 --> 14:26.093
It doesn't have to be that way.
We go to the same school.

14:26.265 --> 14:29.860
We have the same friends. We keep
the same secrets. It's gonna work, Tyler.

14:30.035 --> 14:33.027
I mean, it's your home.
It's my home too. I want this to work.

14:43.515 --> 14:44.709
Help. Help.

14:47.453 --> 14:49.478
Whose number was that, hmm?

14:51.624 --> 14:54.457
Damn it. I'm trying to save your life.
Can't you see that?

14:56.929 --> 14:58.157
We have a problem.

15:03.202 --> 15:07.832
So, John, rumor has it
you know a lot and won't say anything.

15:08.007 --> 15:10.874
How do I know you can be trusted,
Damon?

15:11.043 --> 15:12.670
Originals can compel vampires.

15:12.845 --> 15:15.814
And according to Stefan,
that's why Katherine's in the tomb.

15:16.181 --> 15:18.240
An Original has compelled her
to stay there.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.384
Because the vervain had left
her system.

15:20.552 --> 15:23.817
Stefan and I, on the other hand,
are chock-full.

15:25.057 --> 15:26.581
You guys are drinking vervain?

15:27.192 --> 15:29.023
It's an acquired taste.

15:29.828 --> 15:32.763
I don't see that magical ring
on your stitched finger.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.525
So if you know something about Klaus,
start talking...

15:35.701 --> 15:39.569
...or I will kill you in your sleep.

15:40.873 --> 15:45.469
Now, is that any way to convince me
that you and I are on the same side?

15:45.911 --> 15:49.176
First, I need to know
that I can trust you, Damon...

15:49.348 --> 15:51.077
...that I can count on you.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.882
Then we'll talk.

16:00.859 --> 16:01.883
Hey. Hey.

16:04.029 --> 16:05.587
Hey.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.898
- I haven't seen you.
- I'm not avoiding you, I swear.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.561
Yeah, you're avoiding me a little.

16:14.707 --> 16:18.040
Okay, maybe a little.

16:18.210 --> 16:21.304
Can we talk later? I'm heading to work
right now but maybe after?

16:21.513 --> 16:26.450
- We'll clear up some of this weirdness?
- Yeah. Yeah. I'd really like that.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.416
- I'll just swing by when you're closing?
- Sounds good.

16:30.589 --> 16:32.784
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.231
Excuse me.

16:44.770 --> 16:47.330
- Caroline, right?
- Yeah.

16:47.539 --> 16:51.475
I'm looking for Tyler.
You haven't seen him, have you?

16:52.778 --> 16:56.544
No, not since earlier. Sorry.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.642
I know you're lying.

17:00.619 --> 17:02.849
Really? How?

17:03.055 --> 17:05.147
Is that one of your little wolf tricks?

17:05.958 --> 17:07.823
Actually, it is.

17:10.162 --> 17:13.256
Well, I have a trick too.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.020
I see you got the bullet out.

18:19.531 --> 18:22.932
That was... nasty.

18:24.903 --> 18:29.237
I got lots of wooden bullets,
other toys.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.871
It's gonna be a long night, sweet pea.

18:39.551 --> 18:42.384
You wanna be friends, great.
We're friends.

18:43.255 --> 18:45.951
- Will you go now?
- I don't know what else to say to you.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.719
I came back to this town
because I wanted a life.

18:48.894 --> 18:52.625
I wanted to exist where I could have
friends and where I could build a family.

18:53.298 --> 18:57.234
I have that here.
We can both have that.

19:06.411 --> 19:09.676
- Hey. Everything okay?
- <i>That depends.</i>

19:09.882 --> 19:11.679
How badly
do you wanna keep her alive?

19:14.086 --> 19:15.917
- Who is this?
- <i>Ask your brother.</i>

19:16.088 --> 19:17.316
Where is Tyler?

19:20.659 --> 19:22.320
Jules.

19:23.929 --> 19:27.092
- Where's Caroline?
- You made a mistake, Stefan.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.097
I'm gonna give you a chance to fix it.

19:29.268 --> 19:31.327
- Where is she?
- Right here. Want proof?

19:34.339 --> 19:35.806
He needs proof.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.115
- What?
- Hurt her again and you're dead.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.512
I hurt her again and she's dead.
Bring Tyler to me.

19:51.690 --> 19:55.057
The clearing by Wickery Falls.
You have 20 minutes until she dies.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.463
So my friend wants to meet you.

20:03.635 --> 20:06.729
- Damon Salvatore, this is...
- I know you.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.367
The news lady.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.704
Yeah, Andie Starr. Nice to meet you.

20:13.345 --> 20:15.905
<i>And I wonder if you know</i>

20:16.081 --> 20:18.311
Can I buy you a drink, Damon?

20:20.686 --> 20:23.246
My glass is all full, Andie. Thank you.

20:25.857 --> 20:29.816
<i>We say goodbye in the pouring rain</i>
<i>And I break down as you walk away</i>

20:29.995 --> 20:31.553
You totally blew her off.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.665
I'm steering clear of all women
at the moment.

20:36.368 --> 20:37.699
You didn't have to be rude.

20:37.869 --> 20:40.531
Trust me, it's in the best interest
of women everywhere.

20:41.340 --> 20:45.174
<i>But I could never find the words to say</i>

20:48.780 --> 20:50.475
Stefan?

20:52.184 --> 20:53.742
What is it?

20:57.222 --> 21:00.350
- Why am I finding out about this now?
- Stefan was worried you'd...

21:00.525 --> 21:03.688
That I would what? I would kill him?
That's what needs to happen.

21:03.862 --> 21:05.022
No, Damon, not Tyler.

21:05.197 --> 21:08.928
Do what you need to do to get Caroline
back but leave Tyler out of it, okay?

21:09.101 --> 21:11.126
Why? He's a werewolf.
He needs to die.

21:11.303 --> 21:13.203
I'm willing to kill. It's a win-win.

21:13.372 --> 21:15.135
Damon, please.

21:15.307 --> 21:17.798
Okay, too many people are dead.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.140
You need to stop doing that.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.378
Doing what?

21:22.547 --> 21:26.483
Assuming that I'll play the good guy
because it's you who's asking.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.588
Be the better man, Damon.

21:35.093 --> 21:36.720
- Do you mind?
- What's going on?

21:36.895 --> 21:39.056
- Nothing.
- It doesn't look like nothing.

21:39.231 --> 21:42.132
Well, guess what, John?
Trust works both ways. Get out.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.394
We don't have time.
We need to get Caroline.

21:44.569 --> 21:46.594
We don't need to. I'll take care of it.

21:46.772 --> 21:48.763
Ground your daughter. Keep her here.

21:48.940 --> 21:51.067
- I'm coming with you.
- No. I'm with Damon on this.

21:51.243 --> 21:53.234
- Mm-mm.
- No, stop. You're not going anywhere.

21:53.412 --> 21:54.902
Just tell me what's going on.

22:01.320 --> 22:06.986
So how many vampires are there
in this town anyway?

22:19.371 --> 22:22.306
- Don't know.
- Why are you doing this to me?

22:22.474 --> 22:24.203
Why are you doing this to me?

22:25.210 --> 22:28.441
- Why?
- You're a vampire.

22:31.116 --> 22:33.277
Why not?

22:37.222 --> 22:38.348
Sorry. What was that?

22:39.658 --> 22:43.025
- Get me out!
- Excuse me? What was that?

22:44.629 --> 22:46.494
Let me out!

22:55.670 --> 22:58.104
- Get it out of your system?
- No.

22:58.273 --> 23:01.640
- I'm just getting started.
- Brady, let's be smart about this.

23:01.810 --> 23:04.870
I just want the boy. It's our duty
to help him. It's who we are.

23:05.047 --> 23:08.608
You wanna talk duty and honor?
These are vampires.

23:08.784 --> 23:10.945
They cross one of us,
they cross all of us.

23:12.888 --> 23:14.719
That's who we are.

23:17.526 --> 23:20.017
- You're not leaving.
- You can't tell me what to do.

23:20.195 --> 23:23.687
I can. Wanna know why? Because
I'm here to make sure you stay safe.

23:23.865 --> 23:24.991
I've got that covered.

23:25.167 --> 23:28.068
Are you talking about the deal
that you made with Elijah?

23:29.704 --> 23:32.104
You really think he's gonna keep
his promise to you?

23:32.374 --> 23:35.241
Putting your faith in him
was a dumb move.

23:35.410 --> 23:39.073
I should put my faith in you after
everything you did to Stefan and Damon?

23:39.281 --> 23:42.648
We've had our differences,
and I've made mistakes.

23:42.984 --> 23:46.579
- But you and I? We're family.
- You don't get to use that word.

23:46.988 --> 23:49.684
That word is off-limits to you.

23:50.058 --> 23:54.324
Fine, but it doesn't change the facts.

23:55.564 --> 23:58.328
You're right.
Facts are facts, so listen up.

23:58.500 --> 24:01.560
You may be my father,
but I'm never going to be your daughter.

24:01.970 --> 24:03.801
<i>You ain't taking that from me</i>

24:03.972 --> 24:05.803
<i>- Oh, oh, no</i>
<i>- You ain't taking that</i>

24:19.621 --> 24:21.885
I know you're out there.

24:29.231 --> 24:30.926
Where's Caroline?

24:31.766 --> 24:33.256
Locked up tight.

24:34.136 --> 24:35.933
Let her go and I'll release Tyler.

24:37.439 --> 24:39.930
Doesn't have to get any messier
than it already has.

24:40.876 --> 24:42.104
I'm not your enemy, Jules.

24:42.277 --> 24:45.269
It's a little late to be waving
a white flag, don't you think?

24:46.915 --> 24:48.212
You need to leave town.

24:48.984 --> 24:51.145
No one else has to get hurt.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.711
I'm not leaving without Tyler.

24:55.223 --> 25:00.126
Tyler's free to make his own decisions,
as soon as you release Caroline.

25:00.295 --> 25:01.626
My brother the peacemaker.

25:04.933 --> 25:07.401
Since Stefan got here before me,
I'll try his way...

25:07.569 --> 25:11.164
...before I resort to my way,
which is a little bloodier.

25:11.973 --> 25:13.497
So give us Caroline.

25:13.675 --> 25:15.802
- Let go of Tyler.
- Give us Caroline.

25:16.178 --> 25:19.670
Without a full moon,
it's not an even fight and you know it.

25:20.148 --> 25:21.775
We will take you.

25:22.384 --> 25:24.181
I'm not so sure about that, tough guy.

25:43.538 --> 25:47.304
Let's try this again. Give us Tyler.

25:49.110 --> 25:52.944
You heard her. Go. Get over there.

25:58.520 --> 26:01.978
- Which one of you killed Mason?
- Uh, that'd be me.

26:02.724 --> 26:06.319
Boys, make sure that one suffers.

26:10.031 --> 26:13.023
- We can take them.
- I don't know about that.

26:13.201 --> 26:14.691
Well, then.

26:33.088 --> 26:36.888
Tyler. There's a latch. There's a latch
on the door and I can't get to it.

26:39.227 --> 26:40.353
Tyler?

26:45.767 --> 26:47.359
Tyler, please.

26:47.969 --> 26:49.698
Tyler?

27:10.592 --> 27:11.684
Come on.

28:00.342 --> 28:02.333
What's happening?

28:04.045 --> 28:05.273
What the hell's going on?

28:23.565 --> 28:25.931
Elijah made a promise to Elena.

28:26.101 --> 28:29.161
I'm here to see it's upheld.
You need to go.

28:40.648 --> 28:42.616
Get out of here. Now.

28:51.359 --> 28:55.318
When your friends awaken,
give them a message.

28:56.197 --> 28:58.222
They need to get the hell
out of this town.

29:19.421 --> 29:22.584
- So is your mom home?
- No, she's at work.

29:22.757 --> 29:26.989
- I can come in if you want me to.
- I'm fine, Stefan.

29:30.298 --> 29:32.425
You don't have to pretend with me.

29:32.767 --> 29:36.362
Anybody would be upset
after what you went through tonight.

29:40.475 --> 29:42.306
I'm okay.

29:44.479 --> 29:48.506
I'm not girly little Caroline anymore.

29:48.683 --> 29:50.548
I can handle myself.

29:53.288 --> 29:55.051
Sure you can.

29:58.893 --> 30:02.294
I just really wanna go shower, so...

30:02.464 --> 30:03.897
Okay.

30:04.299 --> 30:06.392
- Good night.
- Good night.

30:16.144 --> 30:20.205
- What do you want?
- We didn't finish our conversation.

30:21.416 --> 30:23.077
I'll bite.

30:23.284 --> 30:26.720
I've been thinking.
Personal feelings aside, Damon...

30:26.888 --> 30:30.346
...I think you and Stefan
will do all you can to protect Elena.

30:31.292 --> 30:36.355
- I agree with that statement.
- So I come bearing gifts.

30:37.866 --> 30:42.667
- What the hell is that?
- This is how you kill an Original.

30:43.505 --> 30:45.666
In this vial is ash
from a white oak tree...

30:45.840 --> 30:48.240
...that dates back to the genesis
of the Originals.

30:48.409 --> 30:54.211
The dagger must be dipped into the ash
and then plunged into their heart.

30:57.952 --> 31:01.444
- How do you know all this, John?
- Isobel.

31:01.890 --> 31:04.450
She's very good at finding out things.

31:04.626 --> 31:07.424
- But, of course, you know that.
- Where is Isobel?

31:07.595 --> 31:10.928
Let's just say if she accomplishes
what she's attempting...

31:11.099 --> 31:13.829
...Klaus will never set foot
in Mystic Falls.

31:15.537 --> 31:19.473
Where Elena's concerned,
you and I are on the same side.

31:37.158 --> 31:40.286
- Hi.
- Hey, did something happen?

31:41.462 --> 31:44.795
Oh, my... I am so sorry, Matt.

31:44.966 --> 31:46.729
- Are you okay?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

31:46.901 --> 31:50.997
Something came up with Bonnie
and she needed me.

31:51.172 --> 31:54.573
<i>A friend thing. You understand?</i>

31:55.009 --> 31:57.807
Yeah. Uh, so are you with her right now?

31:57.979 --> 32:00.948
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>So I'm not gonna make it tonight, Matt.</i>

32:01.115 --> 32:03.675
- <i>But can I see you tomorrow?</i>
- Yeah. Sure.

32:03.885 --> 32:06.353
I hope everything works out.
Good night.

32:06.521 --> 32:08.182
Good night.

32:24.505 --> 32:26.029
Are you okay?

32:27.909 --> 32:32.608
- I'm fine.
- I had no idea they would come for you.

32:34.916 --> 32:37.214
Do you know what they did to me?

32:38.286 --> 32:40.015
I'm sorry.

32:40.788 --> 32:43.313
But it's crazy now.

32:43.491 --> 32:45.652
Okay? I don't know who to trust.

32:45.827 --> 32:49.524
- You lied to me.
- I lied to protect my friends.

32:49.697 --> 32:52.564
I lied to protect you.
Don't you get that?

32:53.167 --> 32:54.828
- Caroline...
- You just stood there.

32:55.003 --> 32:57.233
When they were gonna kill us?
You stood there.

32:57.438 --> 32:59.668
- Didn't do anything.
- I didn't know what to do.

32:59.841 --> 33:02.742
You help your friend.
That's what you do.

33:04.012 --> 33:06.071
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's too late.

33:06.547 --> 33:08.037
We're not friends anymore.

33:08.216 --> 33:11.208
And what happened to me tonight,
that will never happen again.

33:11.386 --> 33:13.752
So you take that back
to your werewolf pack...

33:13.955 --> 33:16.651
...and you get the hell
out of my house.

33:37.645 --> 33:40.136
- I'm sorry about earlier.
- Enough already.

33:40.415 --> 33:43.509
I don't want you here
and I can't make that any more clear.

33:43.685 --> 33:45.915
I didn't come here to fight with you,
Elena.

33:46.087 --> 33:48.180
Yeah, I know.
You're here to protect me.

33:48.589 --> 33:50.557
Got it. Get in line.

33:50.858 --> 33:52.485
I thought you might want this.

33:54.862 --> 33:56.762
It was your mother's.

33:58.433 --> 34:00.901
- Isobel?
- No.

34:01.169 --> 34:03.603
Your mother, Miranda.

34:04.305 --> 34:08.297
I remember her wearing it
when she was young.

34:09.310 --> 34:12.871
I found it in a box
with some things that your dad left me.

34:15.083 --> 34:17.210
Here. It's yours now.

34:20.788 --> 34:24.053
Miranda and Grayson were your parents,
Elena.

34:26.994 --> 34:30.293
And I know I'm nothing to you.

34:31.232 --> 34:34.759
You have no reason to believe me
or trust me.

34:34.936 --> 34:37.666
I've done so many horrible things.

34:37.839 --> 34:42.503
But when you lost your parents,
I lost my brother.

34:42.710 --> 34:44.643
My family.

34:45.780 --> 34:47.246
I lost my way.

34:47.415 --> 34:50.350
I'm never going to make things right
with you, I know that...

34:50.518 --> 34:54.750
...but I'm gonna do everything I can...

34:55.223 --> 34:59.250
...to protect you
and protect this family.

35:13.174 --> 35:14.766
Elena?

35:24.051 --> 35:26.315
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

35:26.487 --> 35:27.954
Did you hear that?

35:28.556 --> 35:32.993
I don't believe him, Stefan.
I just don't.

35:37.298 --> 35:39.198
What happened tonight?
How's Caroline?

35:40.501 --> 35:41.866
I could use your help.

35:47.341 --> 35:48.399
Hey, come on in.

35:56.784 --> 35:58.581
I'm sorry about your friends.

36:22.510 --> 36:24.603
It's not always like this.

36:26.013 --> 36:27.446
- Is it?
- No.

36:29.116 --> 36:32.051
- Is it, Brady?
- No, man.

36:32.220 --> 36:35.348
You're living in vampire country,
that's all.

36:35.890 --> 36:37.687
It's way better than this.

36:38.359 --> 36:42.022
Mason didn't tell me anything about it.
He was gone.

36:42.196 --> 36:44.790
Dead, I guess,
before he could help me.

36:44.966 --> 36:47.958
I don't get what Mason
was even doing here in the first place.

36:48.135 --> 36:49.898
His brother died, you know that.

36:50.071 --> 36:53.131
But why was he stupid enough to stay
and get himself killed?

36:53.541 --> 36:55.941
Because of this rock
he was trying to find.

36:57.912 --> 37:00.073
- What rock?
- A moonstone.

37:01.582 --> 37:03.743
- I had no idea.
- What?

37:06.954 --> 37:08.148
Moonstone.

37:09.624 --> 37:11.387
- Did he find it?
- Yeah.

37:11.559 --> 37:13.254
Where is it now?

37:13.427 --> 37:14.917
I couldn't tell you.

37:34.015 --> 37:35.107
- Hey.
- Hi.

37:36.384 --> 37:38.682
- What's going on?
- I was a bit worried about you.

37:38.886 --> 37:40.854
After everything you went through
tonight.

37:41.022 --> 37:42.512
I'm fine.

37:42.690 --> 37:48.390
Well, good. But just in case,
I, uh, brought some backup.

37:53.167 --> 37:54.327
We're gonna slumber it.

37:56.537 --> 37:58.630
We haven't done it in ages.

37:58.806 --> 37:59.966
Hi.

38:12.286 --> 38:14.345
<i>I love you.</i>

38:15.222 --> 38:17.452
<i>I love you.</i>

38:26.968 --> 38:29.163
I can't believe you called me.

38:29.337 --> 38:32.795
Thought I was being way too forward
when I had Jenna give you my number.

38:33.474 --> 38:35.374
I like a woman
who knows what she wants.

38:35.543 --> 38:37.738
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm.

38:38.145 --> 38:41.512
So, what do you want,
Mr. Tall-Dark-And-Handsome?

38:41.882 --> 38:42.940
I'm not that tall.

38:48.189 --> 38:49.349
I need a distraction.

38:49.523 --> 38:51.457
You can booty call me
anytime you want.

38:52.760 --> 38:57.959
See, the thing is,
Miss Sexy-Reporter-Girl...

38:59.333 --> 39:02.461
...I have a problem I need help with.
It's really messing with my mind.

39:03.404 --> 39:05.872
Oh, tell me about it.

39:09.210 --> 39:11.735
I'm in love with a woman
I can never have.

39:11.912 --> 39:13.709
I knew it.

39:14.415 --> 39:16.906
I know how to pick them.

39:17.351 --> 39:21.219
So why can't you have her?
She's with another man, I assume?

39:21.589 --> 39:26.083
Yeah. That's not the point.
The point is I'm in love with her and l...

39:26.260 --> 39:28.888
It's driving me crazy,
I'm not in control.

39:29.196 --> 39:31.391
What, you don't trust yourself
around her?

39:31.565 --> 39:34.033
I don't trust myself around anyone,
Andie.

39:36.037 --> 39:39.131
I'm bad, Andie. I do things.

39:39.306 --> 39:40.432
Ooh.

39:40.608 --> 39:41.939
I kill people.

39:47.114 --> 39:49.048
Don't be afraid.

39:50.651 --> 39:51.743
You're okay.

40:00.561 --> 40:01.960
Why do you kill people?

40:03.431 --> 40:05.422
Because I like it.

40:06.467 --> 40:09.527
It's in my nature. It's who I am.

40:10.438 --> 40:12.235
But then I have to protect her.

40:12.406 --> 40:16.240
And she wants me to be the better man,
which means I can't be who I am.

40:19.780 --> 40:22.010
Do you see the problem I'm having,
Andie?

40:22.183 --> 40:24.413
Well, maybe this is who you are now.

40:24.952 --> 40:28.444
Love does that, Damon. It changes us.

40:31.926 --> 40:33.223
Just stop talking.

40:34.595 --> 40:36.324
Just kiss me.

40:36.497 --> 40:38.590
Be my distraction.

41:29.383 --> 41:31.749
I know
you were expecting someone else.

41:32.353 --> 41:34.514
I sent Stefan to find Isobel.

41:35.122 --> 41:39.252
She got your message.
She was busy so she sent me instead.

41:39.426 --> 41:41.519
Does Stefan know
that you're here right now?

41:41.695 --> 41:44.858
No. No one does.

41:45.633 --> 41:49.694
This is between you, me and Isobel.

41:50.371 --> 41:52.999
I want out of this tomb, John.

41:53.741 --> 41:55.208
I'm already on it.
