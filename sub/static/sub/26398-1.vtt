01:20.404 --> 01:22.270
No, go ahead. Go ahead!

01:22.272 --> 01:23.772
Starting with that fat

01:23.774 --> 01:26.240
fucking dick away!

01:26.242 --> 01:27.608
- Make yourself happy.
- Bullshit.

01:27.610 --> 01:29.713
Don't wander over here
with your dick anymore.

01:32.148 --> 01:33.715
Go on. Get out.
Get out of our house.

01:33.717 --> 01:34.916
You know
how I feel about this!

01:34.918 --> 01:36.183
Get out
of my fucking house!

01:36.185 --> 01:37.321
Bullshit!

01:49.666 --> 01:50.667
Mom?

01:52.402 --> 01:53.470
Is everything all right?

01:54.338 --> 01:55.570
Yeah.

01:55.572 --> 01:57.106
Yeah, everything's fine.

02:07.284 --> 02:08.620
Thank you for dinner tonight.

02:09.318 --> 02:10.320
Welcome.

02:15.392 --> 02:16.627
I'm sure he didn't mean it.

02:17.361 --> 02:18.362
Go to bed, kid.

02:23.801 --> 02:24.869
Good night, Mom.

02:26.236 --> 02:27.237
Love you.

02:46.223 --> 02:47.957
Do anything fun
last night?

02:47.959 --> 02:50.660
Well, not really.

02:50.662 --> 02:52.895
You wanna come to church
with me and my family tomorrow?

02:52.897 --> 02:54.597
Um...

02:54.599 --> 02:55.899
No, thanks. Thank you though.

02:55.901 --> 02:57.266
You sure? We could pick you up.

02:57.268 --> 02:59.402
Oh, yeah, I'm fine. Um...

02:59.404 --> 03:00.603
Can you make sure
Bobby gets his lunch?

03:00.605 --> 03:01.737
I'm gonna go and take my break.

03:01.739 --> 03:02.805
Yeah.

03:02.807 --> 03:04.509
Okay. Thank you.

03:10.415 --> 03:12.715
Boy, oh, then. There she is.

03:12.717 --> 03:13.917
You ready?

03:13.919 --> 03:16.285
Hell yeah. I even showered.

03:21.694 --> 03:22.695
Hey, Bear?

03:24.295 --> 03:25.296
Yeah, baby?

03:27.331 --> 03:28.901
You ever been to San Francisco?

03:31.436 --> 03:32.437
'Course.

03:35.874 --> 03:36.875
Was it nice?

03:39.745 --> 03:40.746
It's all right.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.585
So, when will you be back?

03:49.587 --> 03:51.755
- Soon.
- Yeah. Better be.

03:51.757 --> 03:53.824
Oh, you know I will.

03:53.826 --> 03:55.759
- There you go, baby.
- Thanks, Bear.

03:55.761 --> 03:56.862
- All right.
- You're welcome.

03:58.297 --> 03:59.629
You stay sweet now, you hear?

03:59.631 --> 04:01.233
- Yeah, I will.
- All right.

04:05.805 --> 04:07.471
- Am I in your way?
- Yeah.

04:07.473 --> 04:08.641
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

04:09.976 --> 04:13.543
Did your mom find any work yet?

04:13.545 --> 04:15.078
No, there's not a whole lot
out there right now,

04:15.080 --> 04:18.415
so I think she's pretty much
just stopped looking.

04:18.416 --> 04:20.916
Is she... She's still
on unemployment though, right?

04:20.918 --> 04:22.088
No, that ran out a while ago.

04:25.524 --> 04:27.925
So, then you're, you're just
footin' the bill for everything?

04:27.927 --> 04:29.527
No, we... we still get stamps
and everything.

04:29.529 --> 04:31.362
No, but, you know...

04:31.364 --> 04:32.563
- Maybelle.
- You know what I mean.

04:32.565 --> 04:34.332
Yeah. It's all right though.

04:34.334 --> 04:37.036
She just needs a little help
right now, that's all.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.805
Okay.

04:40.807 --> 04:42.506
Sometimes, I feel like
I ought to smack

04:42.508 --> 04:44.809
- some sense into that woman.
- Maybelle.

04:44.811 --> 04:46.376
You don't really mean that.

04:46.378 --> 04:47.547
Actually, I do.

04:54.420 --> 04:55.421
Oh.

04:57.624 --> 04:59.991
I'm... I'm sorry.

04:59.993 --> 05:01.058
Want me to wash your apron
for you?

05:01.060 --> 05:02.359
- Please.
- Okay.

05:02.361 --> 05:03.426
Hey.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.631
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:06.566 --> 05:07.901
Okay. Bye, Dale.

05:35.595 --> 05:36.630
Bruno.

05:39.500 --> 05:40.501
Give me a hand.

05:58.185 --> 05:59.918
Hello, Mr. Daniels.

05:59.920 --> 06:00.986
Oh, hi, Katie.

06:00.988 --> 06:02.590
- Getting gas?
- Yeah.

06:04.525 --> 06:05.891
You want a ride?

06:05.893 --> 06:07.060
Yeah, sure.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.862
Gotta make it quick though.
I'm already running late.

06:08.864 --> 06:09.865
Sure.

06:24.179 --> 06:25.613
Can I ask you something?

06:26.513 --> 06:27.579
What?

06:27.581 --> 06:29.048
You think I should get my GED?

06:29.050 --> 06:30.116
'Cause I've been thinking that...

06:30.118 --> 06:31.184
You're a waitress.

06:31.186 --> 06:32.552
So, it doesn't matter.

06:32.554 --> 06:33.688
How much do I owe you?

06:34.856 --> 06:36.724
Uh, how does
eleven sound?

06:37.892 --> 06:39.858
Uh, I only have nine.

06:39.860 --> 06:41.562
Nine's great. Thanks.

06:44.132 --> 06:45.901
- Thank you, Mr. Daniels.
- You're welcome.

06:52.741 --> 06:53.742
Momma?

06:54.876 --> 06:55.677
Yeah?

06:57.913 --> 06:59.514
Do you believe
in love at first sight?

07:02.817 --> 07:03.852
No.

07:10.592 --> 07:11.593
I do.

07:57.539 --> 07:59.075
You remember
to give Mr. Willard the rent?

07:59.675 --> 08:00.676
Mm-hm.

08:01.610 --> 08:02.645
How do I look?

08:03.679 --> 08:05.280
You're beautiful.

08:05.282 --> 08:06.749
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:07.950 --> 08:09.550
Evening.

08:09.552 --> 08:10.786
Hey, go get him some food.

08:12.654 --> 08:13.821
Hi, baby.

08:13.823 --> 08:14.857
Hey.

08:25.068 --> 08:26.802
Thank you for this day, Daddy.

08:28.939 --> 08:30.338
I hope that I lived right today,

08:30.340 --> 08:31.840
and that if you could
see me one day,

08:31.842 --> 08:32.976
I'd make you proud.

08:37.347 --> 08:38.547
Good night.

08:45.654 --> 08:46.790
There you go.

08:51.361 --> 08:52.696
So, who's the new guy?

08:54.164 --> 08:55.230
Bruno?

08:55.232 --> 08:56.831
Yeah, where he'd come from?

08:56.833 --> 08:57.901
Why?

08:58.702 --> 08:59.835
You got a thing for him?

09:00.903 --> 09:02.039
I don't know. Maybe.

09:03.874 --> 09:05.340
Where's your friend?

09:05.342 --> 09:07.208
I... I don't know. I...

09:07.210 --> 09:09.846
think he just got out of prison
in Phoenix or something.

09:10.781 --> 09:11.782
You gonna fuck him?

09:14.751 --> 09:16.718
I meant, I don't know.
I don't even know him.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.320
Yeah.

09:18.322 --> 09:21.323
Yeah, I bet
you'll fuck him all right.

09:21.325 --> 09:22.391
We going for a ride?

09:22.393 --> 09:23.657
- Stop.
- What?

09:23.659 --> 09:24.759
- Katie.
- Coming.

09:24.761 --> 09:25.762
A little peace?

09:32.803 --> 09:35.106
So, what brought you here?
What brought you to town?

09:37.375 --> 09:40.011
Oh, me? I... I've...
I've been here all my life.

09:41.079 --> 09:42.180
Born and raised.

09:45.983 --> 09:48.083
So maybe you'd like
to go out one time?

09:48.085 --> 09:49.253
Maybe you'd like to...

09:50.288 --> 09:52.190
take me out to dinner one time?

09:53.723 --> 09:55.259
You know, maybe you'd like
to go on a date?

10:03.401 --> 10:04.602
Hi.

10:05.703 --> 10:06.704
Hello.

10:43.841 --> 10:45.676
Yeah!

11:08.767 --> 11:10.867
You shouldn't be
hangin' around here.

11:10.869 --> 11:13.203
Come on. You know that.

11:13.205 --> 11:15.772
Willy's dad's in there
with your mom.

11:15.774 --> 11:18.043
Well, now, that's none
of our business, is it?

11:28.420 --> 11:30.253
What're you doing?

11:30.255 --> 11:32.055
I was gonna try
and jump through my window,

11:32.057 --> 11:33.692
but I guess I locked
the darn thing.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.336
You know we were all made
by those sounds?

11:50.343 --> 11:52.976
Sounds kind of funny though,
doesn't it?

11:52.978 --> 11:54.044
Yeah.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.047
Yeah.

11:57.483 --> 11:59.450
You just gotta be
patient, Momma.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.453
That's all.

12:02.021 --> 12:03.120
Some guy's bound to come along

12:03.122 --> 12:04.757
and gonna sweep you
off your feet.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.024
Take you out to Reno

12:07.026 --> 12:08.960
and buy you a house
like you've always wanted.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.964
- Doesn't work like that.
- Yeah, it does.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.500
Willy, you believe in love?

12:15.401 --> 12:16.402
Yeah.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.371
Good.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.005
You ever been in love?

12:21.007 --> 12:22.073
No.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.407
I don't know.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.275
Well, you will.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.511
What in the hell
are you doing?

12:26.513 --> 12:27.979
We were out celebrating, Rosa.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.113
I got a date tomorrow.

12:29.115 --> 12:30.182
Well, I don't want my boy

12:30.184 --> 12:32.384
hangin' around
either one of you.

12:32.386 --> 12:34.119
The last thing I need
is for him to turn on me, too.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.053
You should be grateful.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.988
My daughter
just bought your son a meal.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.990
I'll be grateful
when you stop fucking my man.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.358
Then try doing it yourself.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.392
Momma.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.328
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

12:43.330 --> 12:44.463
Good night, Willy.

12:44.465 --> 12:45.930
Willie, get that
little fuckin' ass over here!

12:45.932 --> 12:46.998
Night, Rosa.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.034
Right now!

12:50.571 --> 12:52.337
- Is he cute?
- Heck yeah, he's cute.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.941
He's the cutest man
I've ever seen.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.009
- There ya go, doll.
- Thank you.

12:57.011 --> 12:58.511
Katie, could you...

12:58.513 --> 13:00.144
Of course, Steve.
Can you wait about two hours?

13:00.146 --> 13:01.147
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:05.286 --> 13:06.351
Has he got a smile?

13:06.353 --> 13:07.486
I don't know. I bet he does.

13:07.488 --> 13:10.422
I bet he's got the most
handsome smile I've ever seen.

13:10.424 --> 13:12.624
Well, be careful of a man
that's got a smile.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.259
You can't trust 'em.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.295
I'm pretty sure I can trust him.

13:16.297 --> 13:17.996
No, I'm telling you.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.032
You gotta find yourself a man
with sad eyes.

13:20.034 --> 13:23.102
A sad man you can mold
and treat you right,

13:23.104 --> 13:25.870
but a man who's got a smile

13:25.872 --> 13:27.239
you can't do nothing with.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.607
Come on, boss.

13:28.609 --> 13:30.544
They will leave you
with a heart full of hurt.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.015
Hey, Bruno.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.017
Is this your car?

13:38.185 --> 13:41.287
No. Uh, I'm working on it.

13:41.289 --> 13:43.491
I haven't ever been
in a convertible before.

13:47.662 --> 13:49.995
I have a motorcycle.

13:49.997 --> 13:51.930
Well, I've never been
on a motorcycle either.

14:00.041 --> 14:01.376
Isn't this amazing?

14:02.644 --> 14:05.013
- What?
- Isn't this amazing?

14:06.682 --> 14:08.214
Oh, yeah.

14:14.289 --> 14:15.490
So, you're from Phoenix?

14:16.358 --> 14:17.690
Tempe.

14:17.692 --> 14:19.561
I've never been. Is it nice?

14:20.929 --> 14:22.030
It's all right, yeah.

14:28.404 --> 14:30.304
Thanks for the milkshake.

14:30.306 --> 14:31.374
Yeah, you're welcome.

14:34.443 --> 14:36.077
You wanna go see
my favorite place?

14:36.711 --> 14:37.912
Sure.

14:42.283 --> 14:43.486
Can I ask you a question?

14:45.186 --> 14:46.187
Yeah.

14:48.224 --> 14:49.425
Do you smile much?

14:53.095 --> 14:54.163
What do you mean?

14:55.998 --> 14:57.032
I don't know, I mean...

14:57.600 --> 14:59.034
do you smile much?

15:03.372 --> 15:04.640
No, I guess not.

15:10.346 --> 15:11.380
Is that all right?

15:12.081 --> 15:13.082
Yeah.

15:13.716 --> 15:15.082
Of course, I'll...

15:15.084 --> 15:16.686
I'll smile enough
for the both of us.

15:20.322 --> 15:21.323
Okay.

15:30.199 --> 15:31.467
You ever seen the ocean?

15:32.501 --> 15:34.268
No.

15:34.270 --> 15:36.005
I've only been out
of Arizona once.

15:37.106 --> 15:38.373
Where'd you go?

15:38.375 --> 15:39.443
New Mexico.

15:46.683 --> 15:49.016
You ever drink Regent's Light?

15:49.018 --> 15:50.417
My momma always drinks those.

15:50.419 --> 15:51.420
Yeah.

15:52.288 --> 15:53.289
They're all right.

15:55.057 --> 15:56.225
I've never had a beer.

16:20.050 --> 16:21.585
You think you could live
in California?

16:27.123 --> 16:28.223
I don't know.

16:28.225 --> 16:29.259
I guess.

16:37.167 --> 16:39.503
Figure I could live anywhere.
Doesn't matter much either way.

16:53.784 --> 16:55.486
I've always wanted
to bring someone here.

16:59.790 --> 17:01.124
It's perfect.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.096
You're perfect, Bruno.

17:18.509 --> 17:19.611
Thank you, Bruno.

17:21.279 --> 17:22.580
Tonight was really special.

17:24.114 --> 17:25.115
Yeah.

17:31.289 --> 17:33.291
You wanna pick me up
from work tomorrow?

17:36.360 --> 17:37.361
Okay.

17:39.363 --> 17:40.364
Yeah?

17:40.799 --> 17:41.800
Yeah.

17:42.701 --> 17:43.702
Okay.

18:46.231 --> 18:47.232
Thank you.

18:49.434 --> 18:50.436
I got it.

18:56.943 --> 18:58.609
So you got a date for prom?

18:58.611 --> 19:00.810
No. Not yet.

19:00.812 --> 19:02.379
I might not even go.

19:02.381 --> 19:03.513
Why?

19:03.515 --> 19:04.782
'Cause nobody's asked me.

19:04.784 --> 19:06.216
Someone's gonna ask you.

19:06.218 --> 19:07.918
You're so smart and pretty.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.920
I'd ask you if I could.

19:09.922 --> 19:11.689
That's just weird.

19:11.691 --> 19:12.590
No, it's not.

19:12.592 --> 19:14.694
Ah, there's Bruno.

19:16.964 --> 19:18.231
Bye.

19:22.736 --> 19:23.868
What are we doing?

19:23.870 --> 19:25.402
Picking up beer.

19:25.404 --> 19:27.272
Okay. I'll wait here for you.

19:36.349 --> 19:37.350
Hey.

20:03.877 --> 20:05.779
Not today.
I'm on a date with my boyfriend.

20:06.613 --> 20:07.679
All right.

20:07.681 --> 20:08.716
This is Bruno.

20:13.887 --> 20:15.521
That's a hell of a ride you got.

20:20.461 --> 20:22.027
I'll see you around.

20:22.029 --> 20:23.662
All right.

20:23.664 --> 20:25.597
Give my regards to your mother.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.665
Sure.

20:32.006 --> 20:33.873
Bruno's a mechanic
over at Bud's.

20:33.875 --> 20:37.409
Right now, he's fixing up
this beautiful old convertible.

20:37.411 --> 20:39.747
It's amazing, and he's
doing a really great job at it.

20:43.051 --> 20:44.984
Cheers.

20:44.986 --> 20:46.351
I'm really happy
you two could meet

20:46.353 --> 20:47.621
and that we're
all here together.

20:48.589 --> 20:49.758
It means a lot to me.

20:54.529 --> 20:55.530
Cheers.

20:59.633 --> 21:00.634
Bon appétit.

21:02.402 --> 21:03.470
You know what that means?

21:06.074 --> 21:07.274
It's French.

21:42.845 --> 21:44.046
Can I ask you something?

21:45.446 --> 21:46.448
Yeah.

21:48.583 --> 21:49.717
Were you in prison?

21:56.826 --> 21:57.860
Who told you that?

22:00.896 --> 22:01.964
Matty.

22:05.467 --> 22:06.468
Yeah.

22:08.103 --> 22:09.338
What for?

22:10.173 --> 22:11.606
Grand theft auto.

22:13.142 --> 22:14.576
Like stealing cars and stuff?

22:15.077 --> 22:16.078
Mm-hm.

22:18.948 --> 22:20.415
So you never hurt anyone?

22:22.952 --> 22:23.953
No.

22:25.087 --> 22:26.355
I never hurt anyone.

22:38.868 --> 22:39.969
How's your momma doing?

22:40.769 --> 22:42.069
She's doing good.

22:42.071 --> 22:43.770
Seems to be
getting better at least.

22:43.772 --> 22:44.905
Yeah?

22:44.907 --> 22:47.143
Oh, I'm so happy to hear that.
That's such good news.

22:48.544 --> 22:50.078
Yeah, um, I could...

22:50.080 --> 22:51.045
give you a ride home

22:51.047 --> 22:52.816
and you could see her then,
if you'd like.

22:54.516 --> 22:55.415
I would love to, Matty,

22:55.417 --> 22:57.721
but I've got a date
with Bruno today.

22:58.088 --> 22:59.786
Um...

22:59.788 --> 23:00.721
Do you mind giving this to him?

23:00.723 --> 23:03.057
It's just something small
for his lunch.

23:03.059 --> 23:04.660
- Sure.
- Thanks, Matty.

23:06.629 --> 23:07.694
Hey, gorgeous.

23:07.696 --> 23:09.163
Hello.

23:09.165 --> 23:10.632
Um, the usual?

23:10.634 --> 23:12.569
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

23:21.011 --> 23:22.778
I'm happy for you, Katie.

23:26.216 --> 23:28.417
This feeling you've got...

23:32.022 --> 23:33.590
That's what life's all about.

23:41.731 --> 23:43.498
Yeah.

23:43.500 --> 23:44.769
It feels nice.

23:48.939 --> 23:51.172
I haven't ever had this before.

23:54.178 --> 23:55.645
I know you haven't.

24:09.193 --> 24:10.894
Got any brothers or sisters?

24:13.863 --> 24:14.931
I don't think so.

24:16.867 --> 24:18.169
Yeah, I don't think I do either.

24:24.709 --> 24:26.010
You know
what you wanna do in life?

24:30.915 --> 24:32.683
Not really.
I'm just trying to...

24:33.651 --> 24:34.784
stay out of trouble.

24:35.920 --> 24:36.921
Hm.

24:38.222 --> 24:39.590
That's a good goal.

24:44.195 --> 24:45.796
I wanna be a beautician.

24:46.764 --> 24:47.997
I wanna...

24:47.999 --> 24:49.734
cut people's hair and stuff.

24:52.636 --> 24:53.903
It's nothing fancy
like being a doctor

24:53.905 --> 24:56.840
or, or anything, but...

24:56.842 --> 24:58.809
<i>I figure it's just
as good as anything else.</i>

25:01.979 --> 25:05.115
<i>It seems like not a whole lot
of people are happy, so...</i>

25:05.117 --> 25:06.249
<i>if I can do something</i>

25:06.251 --> 25:09.019
<i>to make them feel good
about themselves, then...</i>

25:09.021 --> 25:10.956
<i>then they'd be happier,
you know?</i>

25:14.926 --> 25:15.925
<i>When you think about it,</i>

25:15.927 --> 25:17.696
<i>it's just as important
as anything else.</i>

25:19.798 --> 25:20.997
<i>I just think
people need to learn</i>

25:20.999 --> 25:22.666
<i>to appreciate things more.</i>

25:27.205 --> 25:29.207
'Cause if you look at it
in a certain way,

25:31.910 --> 25:33.612
life is just so amazing.

25:46.624 --> 25:47.625
Bruno?

25:51.630 --> 25:54.064
I've been saving up my money
for a really long time,

25:54.066 --> 25:55.967
and I'm gonna move out
to San Francisco.

25:59.272 --> 26:00.273
Okay.

26:02.308 --> 26:04.110
And I want you
to move out there too.

26:07.180 --> 26:08.815
I want us to leave together.

26:15.687 --> 26:16.855
I love you, Bruno.

26:22.195 --> 26:23.196
You do?

26:30.337 --> 26:31.637
Why?

26:35.241 --> 26:37.944
'Cause I see something in you
I haven't ever seen before.

27:23.055 --> 27:24.324
Thank you for this day.

27:26.393 --> 27:28.026
I hope that I lived right today,

27:28.028 --> 27:29.261
and that if you could
see me one day,

27:29.263 --> 27:30.397
I'd make you proud.

27:34.735 --> 27:35.903
Good night, Daddy.

27:37.905 --> 27:39.840
I'm so, so happy right now.

27:45.313 --> 27:46.947
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

27:50.517 --> 27:51.818
What are you doing?

27:53.387 --> 27:56.223
I always say good night
to my dad before going to bed.

28:00.994 --> 28:01.995
Where is he?

28:03.864 --> 28:05.431
I don't know.

28:05.433 --> 28:07.533
My momma says he died
in a mining accident,

28:07.535 --> 28:09.237
but I know it's not true.

28:11.438 --> 28:12.440
How?

28:13.974 --> 28:16.043
Because if it was,
I'd know it in my heart.

28:25.386 --> 28:27.222
Thank you
for such a wonderful day.

28:31.893 --> 28:33.895
Might have been
the best day of my life.

28:43.871 --> 28:45.039
Good night, Bruno.

28:47.041 --> 28:48.076
I love you.

28:50.144 --> 28:51.978
Katie.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.480
Hey, good morning, Mr. Willard.

28:53.482 --> 28:55.983
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

28:55.985 --> 28:58.353
I'd be better
if you paid me my rent, though.

28:59.287 --> 29:00.886
What?

29:00.888 --> 29:02.357
I didn't get my rent.

29:05.059 --> 29:06.125
There must've been a mistake.

29:06.127 --> 29:08.160
I already gave my momma
the money.

29:08.162 --> 29:10.029
You didn't get anything?

29:10.031 --> 29:11.200
I didn't get nothing.

29:13.535 --> 29:15.402
Momma...

29:15.404 --> 29:17.373
All right. I...
I'm sorry, Mr. Willard, uh...

29:18.907 --> 29:20.874
She must've forgotten
or something.

29:20.876 --> 29:22.042
Forgot, my ass.

29:22.044 --> 29:24.010
Your mother probably
pocketed that money

29:24.012 --> 29:25.780
for god knows what.

29:27.283 --> 29:29.082
Can I just give you
half right now

29:29.084 --> 29:30.183
and then another half
at the end of the week?

29:30.185 --> 29:31.918
- I get paid on Friday.
- That's fine.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.153
But this is the last time.

29:33.155 --> 29:34.521
I know. I promise.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.125
- Give me one minute.
- All right.

29:55.411 --> 29:56.877
I'm getting sick and tired

29:56.879 --> 29:58.278
of doing this shit every month.

29:58.280 --> 30:00.348
I know, Mr. Willard.
I'm really sorry.

30:00.350 --> 30:01.516
What in the hell
is going on?

30:01.518 --> 30:02.951
Mr. Willard needs the rent.

30:03.353 --> 30:04.354
What?

30:05.954 --> 30:08.056
Jesus Christ, Katie.

30:08.058 --> 30:09.490
- Momma, don't touch that.
- Where'd you get all that money?

30:09.492 --> 30:10.424
You can't keep doing this.

30:10.426 --> 30:13.160
You're gonna get us
kicked out of here.

30:13.162 --> 30:14.928
Bill just needed to borrow it
for a couple of days.

30:14.930 --> 30:16.063
He's late in paying us back,
all right?

30:16.065 --> 30:17.964
Well, that's fine, but you just
gotta let me know, okay?

30:17.966 --> 30:19.034
Don't get mad at me.

30:20.102 --> 30:21.369
We're gonna get it back, baby.

30:21.371 --> 30:22.337
This is the first hundred.

30:22.339 --> 30:23.338
You'll get the rest
by the end of the week.

30:23.340 --> 30:25.640
This happens next time,
you're out, you hear?

30:25.642 --> 30:27.141
You know,
things are tough right now.

30:27.143 --> 30:28.209
Well, goddamn it,

30:28.211 --> 30:30.445
things are tough for everyone
right now, Tracey.

30:30.447 --> 30:33.549
You think I'm living nice
right now? No, I'm not.

30:33.551 --> 30:34.551
All right.

30:35.652 --> 30:36.885
Goodbye, Momma.

30:47.097 --> 30:48.198
Sorry I'm late, Maybelle.

30:49.032 --> 30:50.131
Everything all right?

30:50.133 --> 30:51.267
Yeah. Everything's fine.

30:53.671 --> 30:55.206
- Hey, Darrel.
- Hey.

30:58.208 --> 30:59.607
You've seen my apron?

30:59.609 --> 31:02.243
Oh, I washed it
for you last night.

31:02.245 --> 31:03.311
Here you go.

31:03.313 --> 31:04.314
Thank you.

31:09.453 --> 31:11.121
You think I could pick up
a double today?

31:14.057 --> 31:15.957
Did your mother
take the rent again?

31:15.959 --> 31:17.493
Yeah, but it's fine.
I'll just pick up some doubles

31:17.495 --> 31:18.727
to make up for it.

31:18.729 --> 31:20.362
Katie, I swear.

31:20.364 --> 31:22.330
Maybelle, it's fine.
It's all right.

31:22.332 --> 31:23.565
Good morning, officer.

31:23.567 --> 31:24.602
- Morning.
- Good morning.

31:27.070 --> 31:28.136
So can I?

31:28.138 --> 31:30.205
Sure. I'm sure Sara'd
appreciate the night off.

31:30.207 --> 31:31.208
Thank you.

32:00.539 --> 32:02.605
Well, now look who it is.

32:02.607 --> 32:06.041
Hey, I'm just stopping by
to give Bruno his lunch.

32:06.043 --> 32:07.446
Bring anything for me?

32:09.314 --> 32:11.048
No. I'm sorry.

32:12.716 --> 32:14.084
You did fuck him, huh?

32:17.689 --> 32:19.456
Now, how come I can't even
get you to blow me

32:19.458 --> 32:21.393
and yet you'll fuck
some dumb idiot, huh?

32:23.127 --> 32:24.527
I don't think
that's fair, do you?

32:24.529 --> 32:25.530
Hm?

32:27.132 --> 32:28.200
What're you doing?

32:29.267 --> 32:31.134
Just catching up.

32:31.136 --> 32:32.202
You touch her like that again,

32:32.204 --> 32:33.102
I'll knock
your fucking teeth out.

32:33.104 --> 32:34.739
Hey, don't let him
get to you.

32:38.577 --> 32:40.010
I brought you
something to eat.

32:44.316 --> 32:45.381
I gotta work a double tonight

32:45.383 --> 32:46.685
so I'm gonna be late
coming back.

32:48.620 --> 32:51.189
I'll just stop by yours
when I'm done.

32:52.123 --> 32:53.389
Yeah.

32:53.391 --> 32:54.393
Okay.

32:55.561 --> 32:56.760
Bye, baby.

32:56.762 --> 32:57.996
Bye, Dirk.

33:03.502 --> 33:04.769
She making you
pay for it?

33:07.172 --> 33:08.173
What?

33:10.543 --> 33:11.544
You heard me.

33:13.479 --> 33:15.481
You ever threaten me again,
your ass goes back to jail.

33:54.487 --> 33:55.819
Hi, Mr. Daniels.

33:55.821 --> 33:57.056
Hi.

33:59.860 --> 34:01.793
Is Sara here?

34:01.795 --> 34:03.396
No.
She had the night off.

34:04.297 --> 34:05.397
Didn't she let you know?

34:06.533 --> 34:07.734
No.

34:11.469 --> 34:13.172
Well, do you need a ride?

34:14.574 --> 34:16.139
- Yeah, I'd love one, actually.
- All right.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.310
Okay.

34:19.344 --> 34:21.344
Okay.

34:21.347 --> 34:22.783
Good night, boss.

34:24.851 --> 34:25.851
Katie.

34:26.652 --> 34:27.821
Be smart now.

34:29.723 --> 34:31.190
Thank you again
for the ride.

34:32.159 --> 34:33.725
I really appreciate it.

34:33.726 --> 34:34.893
Sure.

34:47.574 --> 34:48.706
Where are you going?

34:48.708 --> 34:51.275
I figured
we would catch up, all right?

34:51.277 --> 34:52.911
Oh, I can't tonight,
Mr. Daniels.

34:52.914 --> 34:53.913
I'm already really late.

34:53.915 --> 34:55.313
Oh, it won't take that long.

34:55.315 --> 34:56.449
No, I wish I could,

34:56.451 --> 34:58.483
but I don't even know
if Bruno's eaten or anything.

34:58.485 --> 35:00.952
I'll give you twenty dollars.

35:00.954 --> 35:03.254
Plus the two that I owe you
from before.

35:03.256 --> 35:05.592
I can't, Mr. Daniels. I'm sorry.

35:17.839 --> 35:19.438
Katie. I'm not
gonna take you home

35:19.440 --> 35:21.540
until we do this.

35:21.542 --> 35:23.775
So, let's stop wasting
each other's time

35:23.777 --> 35:24.879
and get started.

35:31.251 --> 35:32.752
I don't have a condom.

35:32.754 --> 35:33.821
Well, I do.

35:34.822 --> 35:35.923
Now unbutton your top.

35:54.809 --> 35:55.810
That's it.

35:57.779 --> 35:58.947
That's a good girl.

36:04.485 --> 36:05.719
Sara, isn't that
your dad's car?

36:05.721 --> 36:06.787
- Oh, shit!
- What?

36:06.789 --> 36:08.522
- What is it?
- Get out.

36:08.524 --> 36:09.625
Now, get the fuck out!

36:10.024 --> 36:11.225
Dad?

36:12.393 --> 36:14.027
What are you doing here?

36:14.029 --> 36:15.361
What's going on?

36:16.264 --> 36:18.799
Katie, what were you doing
with my dad?

36:20.601 --> 36:22.401
What were you doing with my dad?

36:22.403 --> 36:23.837
Go home. Go home!

36:23.839 --> 36:25.005
Right now!

36:50.599 --> 36:51.600
Bruno?

36:57.006 --> 36:58.507
Bruno? It's me. It's Katie.

37:02.611 --> 37:04.411
Hey, baby.

37:04.413 --> 37:06.480
- You're late.
- I know. I'm sorry.

37:06.482 --> 37:08.884
Close the fucking door.
You're gonna let the spiders in.

37:10.719 --> 37:12.287
Fuck.

37:17.761 --> 37:18.993
Don't look at me.

37:20.830 --> 37:22.662
I don't want you
to look at me.

37:29.438 --> 37:31.540
- Thank you for this day, Daddy...
- Katie.

37:35.111 --> 37:35.912
Sorry.

37:38.581 --> 37:40.016
I have to work
in the morning.

37:41.951 --> 37:43.319
I know. I'm sorry.

37:51.795 --> 37:52.996
Don't touch me.

37:55.098 --> 37:56.366
Bruno, what's wrong?

38:05.075 --> 38:06.409
Are you a whore?

38:07.510 --> 38:09.445
- What?
- Are you a whore?

38:10.046 --> 38:11.047
What do you mean?

38:15.585 --> 38:17.687
I mean, do you fuck men
for money?

38:29.033 --> 38:30.034
Yeah.

38:39.109 --> 38:40.110
Why?

38:42.813 --> 38:44.982
Things have just been tough
for my mom and me.

38:49.019 --> 38:50.654
I can stop if you want me to.

38:58.561 --> 38:59.663
Do you want me to stop?

39:03.200 --> 39:04.867
Yeah.

39:04.869 --> 39:06.869
Yeah, I want you to stop.

39:06.871 --> 39:08.572
Okay, Bruno.
I won't ever do that again.

39:12.177 --> 39:14.478
I'm sorry, I didn't think
it meant anything.

39:17.983 --> 39:18.783
It doesn't.

39:20.585 --> 39:22.150
I promise I won't ever
do that again.

39:22.152 --> 39:23.153
Be quiet.

39:37.168 --> 39:38.737
Please don't touch me.

39:41.907 --> 39:43.008
Okay.

39:48.847 --> 39:50.015
Good night, Bruno.

39:52.884 --> 39:53.919
I love you.

40:36.928 --> 40:38.230
Can we talk for a second?

40:39.864 --> 40:40.866
Yeah.

40:48.274 --> 40:50.242
What do you do when you
and Darrel get in a fight?

40:52.044 --> 40:53.110
Nothing.

40:53.112 --> 40:56.247
We've been married so long
we're always in a fight.

40:56.249 --> 40:57.315
Well, what are you
supposed to do

40:57.317 --> 40:58.783
when you wanna make a man happy?

41:02.989 --> 41:05.322
Are you and that mechanic
already going at it?

41:05.324 --> 41:07.658
No, not really. But...

41:07.660 --> 41:09.595
I upset him
and I wanna make it up to him.

41:13.166 --> 41:17.736
Well, whenever you're...
in a situation, wondering

41:17.738 --> 41:19.603
- what to do with a man,
- Mm-hm.

41:19.605 --> 41:22.139
you think about
what a woman would want,

41:22.141 --> 41:23.207
and then you do the opposite.

41:23.209 --> 41:25.576
More like hot and cold?
Things like that?

41:25.578 --> 41:27.046
Yeah. Exactly.

41:30.016 --> 41:31.715
Okay, like...

41:31.717 --> 41:33.887
if you were mad,
what would you want?

41:35.188 --> 41:36.821
What?

41:36.823 --> 41:37.856
I don't know.

41:37.858 --> 41:39.958
You, you would wanna go out
to dinner, right?

41:39.960 --> 41:41.793
Yeah. That would be nice.

41:41.795 --> 41:43.329
So then, you know,

41:43.331 --> 41:45.231
he's gonna want you
to make him dinner.

41:45.233 --> 41:46.766
- Mm-hm.
- Okay?

41:49.835 --> 41:51.336
And you might want
something fancy,

41:51.338 --> 41:52.739
like you would want...

41:53.240 --> 41:55.173
lobster or...

41:55.175 --> 41:57.275
a bottle of wine
and some candlelight.

41:57.277 --> 41:58.777
I don't know.
I've never had lobster.

41:58.779 --> 41:59.878
So,

41:59.880 --> 42:02.248
you know he's gonna want steak,

42:02.250 --> 42:05.217
beer under fluorescent lighting.

42:05.219 --> 42:08.686
And... you'd wanna talk,

42:08.688 --> 42:09.821
- right?
- Yeah.

42:09.823 --> 42:11.622
- So what does that mean?
- He's not gonna want to talk.

42:11.624 --> 42:12.490
No.

42:12.492 --> 42:13.792
He's gonna
wanna watch TV.

42:13.794 --> 42:15.060
- Okay.
- Okay.

42:15.062 --> 42:17.597
And then,
at the end of the night...

42:18.799 --> 42:20.332
you'd wanna make love.

42:20.334 --> 42:22.134
You know, something...

42:22.136 --> 42:23.835
- real sweet that would bring
- Mm-hm.

42:23.837 --> 42:26.405
the two of you close together.

42:26.407 --> 42:28.140
Yeah.

42:28.142 --> 42:30.211
So you know
he's gonna wanna fuck.

42:32.847 --> 42:34.913
My god.

42:34.915 --> 42:36.915
Do you see how easy that is?

42:36.917 --> 42:39.285
Yeah.

42:39.287 --> 42:41.287
Okay. Mm-hm.

42:41.289 --> 42:44.390
Always remember
that men are simple, Katie.

42:44.392 --> 42:45.726
They always have been.

42:49.163 --> 42:50.396
Thank you, Maybelle.

42:50.398 --> 42:51.632
Of course.

43:08.082 --> 43:09.083
Bear?

43:10.084 --> 43:11.085
Yeah, baby?

43:12.687 --> 43:13.888
I can't do it anymore.

43:15.923 --> 43:17.092
I know you can't.

43:20.028 --> 43:21.661
I promised Bruno I wouldn't.

43:24.432 --> 43:26.701
I think that's probably
the right call to make.

43:28.069 --> 43:29.070
Yeah.

43:40.849 --> 43:42.784
So what's the story
about San Francisco?

43:44.286 --> 43:46.719
Well, I've almost got
everything saved up

43:46.721 --> 43:47.720
for my mamma and me,

43:47.722 --> 43:50.890
so it's looking like
I can leave pretty soon.

43:50.892 --> 43:53.160
I thought your momma
was gonna stay?

43:53.162 --> 43:54.394
Yeah, she is.

43:54.396 --> 43:56.331
But I just need to leave her
some money so she's all right.

43:58.500 --> 44:00.302
Figure out what you're
gonna do for work?

44:02.472 --> 44:04.173
Yeah. I'm gonna go
to beauty school.

44:06.074 --> 44:07.141
- You are?
- Yeah.

44:07.143 --> 44:08.476
Well, I'm gonna have
to get a job

44:08.478 --> 44:09.842
waiting tables or something,

44:09.844 --> 44:12.479
but I'm gonna learn
how to cut hair.

44:12.481 --> 44:14.314
It's nothing fancy
like being a lawyer or anything,

44:14.316 --> 44:16.249
but I figure it's something
I might be good at.

44:16.251 --> 44:17.886
No, don't say that, Katie.

44:19.422 --> 44:21.223
We've all got our place
in the world.

44:22.358 --> 44:23.359
Yeah, I know.

44:34.036 --> 44:35.435
You're not mad at me
or anything?

44:35.437 --> 44:36.770
Mad?

44:36.772 --> 44:37.940
Hell no.

44:39.041 --> 44:40.310
Sweetie,
I'm proud of you.

44:41.211 --> 44:42.376
Yeah?

44:42.378 --> 44:43.479
Yeah.

44:46.382 --> 44:48.015
Thank you.

44:48.017 --> 44:49.118
You're welcome.

44:50.887 --> 44:52.255
You know I'll always
be there for you.

44:53.156 --> 44:54.190
I know.

45:02.131 --> 45:04.198
I should go now. Maybelle's
probably expecting me.

45:04.200 --> 45:05.201
Yeah, all right.

45:07.103 --> 45:08.536
Oh, no. Lunch is on me, Bear.

45:08.538 --> 45:10.271
Oh, no, it is not.

45:10.273 --> 45:12.374
- No, it is. It's my treat.
- Listen to me.

45:12.376 --> 45:14.976
I ain't got no one in the world
to care for but myself.

45:14.978 --> 45:16.043
So, you take this money

45:16.045 --> 45:19.147
and let me feel like
I'm doing someone some good.

45:19.149 --> 45:20.251
All right?

45:21.951 --> 45:23.117
Okay.

45:23.119 --> 45:24.754
- Thank you, Bear.
- You're welcome.

45:26.022 --> 45:27.390
- And, hey, Katie.
- Yeah?

45:28.492 --> 45:30.157
You stay sweet, now.

45:30.159 --> 45:31.160
Yeah. I will.

45:42.106 --> 45:43.305
Sara, what are...
what are you doing? You can't...

45:43.307 --> 45:45.607
My dad
told me everything.

45:45.609 --> 45:49.176
Why would you try
to seduce him like that, huh?

45:49.178 --> 45:51.382
You think he would
wanna have sex with you?

45:52.081 --> 45:53.448
He's married.

45:53.450 --> 45:54.416
He has kids.

45:54.418 --> 45:56.485
- He was your teacher.
- I'm sorry.

45:56.487 --> 45:58.088
I don't care if you're sorry.

45:59.290 --> 46:00.956
You're sick.

46:00.958 --> 46:02.124
You're sick,
and there's something

46:02.126 --> 46:03.191
seriously wrong with you.

46:03.193 --> 46:04.494
I'm sorry, but that's
Maybelle's and you can't...

46:04.496 --> 46:05.863
So then replace it.

46:08.032 --> 46:09.266
Who do you think she'll believe?

46:09.966 --> 46:11.066
Me,

46:11.068 --> 46:13.570
or some dumb slut
poorer than shit?

46:21.613 --> 46:23.047
Everything all right?

46:34.291 --> 46:35.426
Are you happy, Bruno?

46:38.028 --> 46:39.029
Yeah.

46:41.298 --> 46:43.000
What kind of question is that?

46:45.570 --> 46:46.502
I don't know.

46:46.504 --> 46:48.206
Just seeing if he was happy,
that's all.

46:50.308 --> 46:51.443
Are you happy, Momma?

46:53.011 --> 46:54.045
No.

46:55.146 --> 46:56.147
I'm not.

46:58.450 --> 47:00.117
But I figure
I wasn't meant to be.

47:04.289 --> 47:06.157
You think you could fix
that car outside?

47:08.660 --> 47:11.060
- Probably.
- That's a great idea, Momma.

47:11.062 --> 47:12.497
Bruno can definitely fix it.

47:18.169 --> 47:19.171
All right then.

47:29.547 --> 47:31.116
Did you fuck
anyone today?

47:33.552 --> 47:34.553
No, Bruno.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.423
I told you
I wasn't doing that anymore.

47:43.529 --> 47:44.530
I meant that.

47:57.343 --> 47:58.409
Do you want me to turn around

47:58.411 --> 47:59.643
so you don't have
to see my face?

47:59.645 --> 48:01.078
No.

48:01.080 --> 48:02.081
It's all right.

48:17.696 --> 48:18.964
Thank you.

48:31.178 --> 48:32.345
Pick me up after work?

48:33.712 --> 48:34.713
Yeah.

48:38.484 --> 48:40.083
See you later, baby.

48:40.085 --> 48:41.086
Have a good day.

48:42.388 --> 48:43.521
<i>So did it work?</i>

48:43.523 --> 48:44.622
Yup.

48:44.624 --> 48:46.293
And he said he was happy, too.

48:47.327 --> 48:48.426
I told you so, doll.

48:48.428 --> 48:50.061
I know you did.

48:50.063 --> 48:51.331
- And guess what?
- What?

48:52.599 --> 48:54.332
We didn't fuck.

48:54.334 --> 48:55.502
We made love.

49:09.483 --> 49:11.251
You ready to fix that car?

49:15.489 --> 49:17.188
All right.

49:17.190 --> 49:18.325
Let me get my tools.

49:23.730 --> 49:25.565
You're getting more play
than I thought, big boy.

49:32.172 --> 49:33.772
You want a ride today?

49:33.774 --> 49:36.174
Oh, no, thanks.
I've got plans with Bruno.

49:36.176 --> 49:37.277
Thank you though.

49:41.582 --> 49:43.451
I think Bruno's plans
might've changed.

49:44.352 --> 49:45.418
Why? What's he doing?

49:47.387 --> 49:49.454
Your momma came by
the shop today.

49:49.456 --> 49:51.124
Yeah, I know.
He's fixing the car.

49:53.561 --> 49:55.228
You two like to keep it
in the family?

49:56.831 --> 49:58.096
Excuse me?

49:58.098 --> 49:59.665
Ignore him, Katie.

49:59.667 --> 50:01.102
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

50:28.329 --> 50:29.431
Come on inside.

50:30.566 --> 50:32.234
We'll let it run for a bit.

50:43.411 --> 50:45.647
Looks like your momma's
car was busted up pretty bad.

50:46.782 --> 50:49.482
I don't know what's
taking so long.

50:49.484 --> 50:50.550
Well, maybe
he didn't have the right tools

50:50.552 --> 50:51.553
for the job.

50:53.622 --> 50:54.623
You want a ride?

50:56.425 --> 50:57.458
Yeah, you want a ride?

51:04.566 --> 51:05.867
- You want a beer?
- No.

51:07.736 --> 51:09.502
Katie, you wanna drink?

51:09.504 --> 51:11.173
No, thanks. Thanks though.

51:13.208 --> 51:14.543
You work it sober, huh?

51:15.712 --> 51:16.779
I respect that.

51:19.515 --> 51:20.683
Hey, I'm just giving you shit.

51:23.418 --> 51:24.519
Turn up here.

51:25.354 --> 51:26.586
What? Why?

51:26.588 --> 51:28.521
Turn here.

51:28.523 --> 51:29.725
I wanna show Katie something.

51:31.259 --> 51:32.459
I need to get back, Matty.

51:32.461 --> 51:33.526
Bruno's probably expecting me...

51:33.528 --> 51:35.428
Hey, it ain't
gonna take long.

51:35.430 --> 51:36.899
- Maybe...
- Quit being a fucking pussy.

51:41.938 --> 51:44.374
It's fine, Katie.
It won't take long.

52:46.837 --> 52:47.938
What's out here?

52:49.673 --> 52:51.640
It's a surprise.

52:51.642 --> 52:52.676
Something special.

53:04.054 --> 53:05.288
Pull over right here.

53:15.867 --> 53:18.667
Let's go, you love birds. Move.

53:18.669 --> 53:20.902
We're gonna have ourselves
a party.

53:20.904 --> 53:22.371
Katie, get your ass out
of the car.

53:23.874 --> 53:24.908
Let's go.

53:30.081 --> 53:31.648
Let's not stay here
too long, okay?

53:33.051 --> 53:35.684
Katie, I don't think
you're in control right now.

53:35.686 --> 53:36.855
That's not your call to make.

53:38.590 --> 53:40.456
Turn the radio up.

53:40.458 --> 53:41.824
Katie and I wanna dance.
Don't we, sweetheart?

53:41.826 --> 53:42.992
No. no, I'm okay...

53:42.994 --> 53:45.295
- Every girl likes to dance.
- Yeah, but not right now.

53:48.766 --> 53:49.833
Tell me something, Katie.

53:52.369 --> 53:53.370
Hm?

53:55.439 --> 53:57.106
How come the town's slut's
fucked half the guys around here

53:57.108 --> 53:58.843
but she hasn't ever given me
or Matty a taste?

54:02.747 --> 54:03.946
I'm talking about you,
sweetheart.

54:03.948 --> 54:05.416
- Leave her alone, Dirk.
- Shut up.

54:06.952 --> 54:08.118
Hm?

54:08.120 --> 54:09.353
I don't know.

54:11.022 --> 54:12.688
Well, we've got needs too,
you know.

54:12.690 --> 54:13.691
Yeah. I know.

54:17.362 --> 54:19.562
And now you're fucking
that lame...

54:19.564 --> 54:21.933
ex-con that's just about mute.

54:23.735 --> 54:24.803
Why's that?

54:26.571 --> 54:27.739
Because I love him.

54:41.920 --> 54:42.988
I'm sure you do.

54:49.662 --> 54:50.761
Come over here.

54:50.763 --> 54:51.962
Come on.
Let's just get out of here.

54:51.964 --> 54:53.630
Hey, we're not, shut up.
We're not going anywhere.

54:53.632 --> 54:54.731
- Can we go? I don't feel good.
- Hey!

54:54.733 --> 54:56.167
Shut the fuck up!

54:56.169 --> 54:57.433
We're not going anywhere.

54:57.435 --> 54:58.568
We're gonna stay right here,

54:58.570 --> 55:00.971
and we'll have ourselves
some fun, okay?

55:00.973 --> 55:02.039
You know,

55:02.041 --> 55:03.673
change the radio station.

55:03.675 --> 55:04.875
None of that hillbilly shit
you like, all right?

55:04.877 --> 55:06.777
Let's play something good.
I wanna show Katie something.

55:06.779 --> 55:08.013
Katie, get your ass over here.

55:11.684 --> 55:13.085
You promise
you're not gonna hurt me?

55:14.019 --> 55:15.387
Uh...

55:17.157 --> 55:18.357
Yeah.

55:18.992 --> 55:20.426
Of course. Hey.

55:21.659 --> 55:24.027
I ain't going to hurt you, okay?

55:24.029 --> 55:26.797
I promise. Here, I just wanna
show you something.

55:26.799 --> 55:28.601
- What is it?
- Okay.

55:30.703 --> 55:32.736
Don't just stand there,
grab the beer.

55:32.738 --> 55:33.806
Hey, it's all right.

55:36.009 --> 55:37.409
You have a good day
at work today?

55:39.212 --> 55:41.045
Get a lot of tips?

55:41.047 --> 55:42.448
Got big tips?

55:44.184 --> 55:45.618
All right, here we go.

55:49.521 --> 55:51.222
Got a name tag.

55:51.224 --> 55:52.924
- Please, Dirk.
- Shut the fuck up!

55:52.926 --> 55:54.060
Get in the goddamn car.

55:57.130 --> 55:58.963
- Here you go.
- No, what are you doing?

55:58.965 --> 56:00.665
- Taste a little bit.
- I don't want to.

56:00.667 --> 56:01.801
Hey, hey, hey.

56:04.004 --> 56:05.203
You want beer?

56:05.205 --> 56:06.471
- No, I just wanna go home.
- Yeah, but we're not going home.

56:06.473 --> 56:09.140
- No, no! Don't! Stop, please!
- I don't wanna do this, okay?

56:09.142 --> 56:10.574
- Hey, shut the fuck up, Matty.
- Matty, please stop...

56:10.576 --> 56:11.976
- It's what you always wanted.
- No, please.

56:11.978 --> 56:13.077
- We're not going home.
- You promised.

56:13.079 --> 56:14.045
You promised
you wouldn't hurt me!

56:14.047 --> 56:16.049
Fuck! Fucking bitch!

56:16.683 --> 56:17.815
Fuck!

56:17.817 --> 56:18.883
- Don't hit her!
- Fucking scratched me.

56:18.885 --> 56:20.018
Shut the fuck up, Matty!

56:20.020 --> 56:21.721
Please, please. Matty, please.

56:22.622 --> 56:23.888
Get off! No!

56:23.890 --> 56:25.859
No, please.

56:26.593 --> 56:27.659
No!

56:27.661 --> 56:29.228
Help!

56:29.230 --> 56:30.195
No!

56:30.197 --> 56:31.797
- It's all right, Katie.
- That's good.

56:31.799 --> 56:32.997
- No.
- That's good.

56:32.999 --> 56:35.066
That's good.

56:35.068 --> 56:38.269
- It's gonna be all right, okay?
- No, Matty!

56:38.271 --> 56:39.537
Shut up!

56:40.607 --> 56:42.274
- There we go.
- No. No.

56:42.276 --> 56:44.909
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, no.

56:44.911 --> 56:47.179
- Matty, please get him off me!
- Oh, shut up!

56:47.181 --> 56:50.149
That's good. That's good.

56:53.554 --> 56:56.121
Oh, god!

56:56.123 --> 56:59.791
- Come on, come on.
- Help!

56:59.793 --> 57:02.593
Come on, come on, oh!

57:02.595 --> 57:05.730
No!

57:05.732 --> 57:08.233
Oh, god! Yeah.

57:10.771 --> 57:12.237
Oh, fuck!

57:12.239 --> 57:13.772
Oh, fuck!

57:15.843 --> 57:16.942
Uh.

57:16.944 --> 57:18.178
Attagirl.

57:18.180 --> 57:19.845
Attagirl.

57:19.847 --> 57:20.647
Whoo!

57:21.983 --> 57:24.316
- She's all yours, pal.
- No. No.

57:33.060 --> 57:34.927
God.

57:34.929 --> 57:36.162
Dirk, I don't wanna...

57:36.164 --> 57:37.297
Quit being a fucking
faggot and fuck her, all right?

57:37.299 --> 57:38.499
She's here now.

57:42.170 --> 57:43.171
Whoo.

57:45.339 --> 57:47.139
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

57:47.141 --> 57:48.207
It's okay,
you can stay right there.

57:48.209 --> 57:49.210
It's okay.

57:50.911 --> 57:53.279
- Matty, please.
- Hey.

57:53.281 --> 57:55.048
You do it
or I'll take her again.

57:55.050 --> 57:57.017
No. No!

57:57.019 --> 57:58.552
All right? Let's go.

58:00.856 --> 58:02.722
- Here you go.
- No, Matty. No!

58:02.724 --> 58:04.724
- It's all right, Katie.
- No!

58:04.726 --> 58:05.692
- No!
- It's all right, okay?

58:05.694 --> 58:07.562
- It's, it's gonna be over soon.
- No!

58:09.164 --> 58:10.265
So, um...

58:12.034 --> 58:13.168
How much do we owe you?

58:17.739 --> 58:18.740
Nothing.

58:20.042 --> 58:21.076
You don't owe me anything.

58:23.612 --> 58:25.178
You hear that, Matty?
Look, it's good, man.

58:25.180 --> 58:26.880
It's on the house, huh?

58:26.882 --> 58:28.117
It's good, man,
it's good.

58:34.189 --> 58:35.589
Promise
you won't tell anyone?

58:37.793 --> 58:39.059
I don't want my momma
to find out.

58:39.061 --> 58:40.262
It wouldn't be good for her.

58:49.771 --> 58:50.840
Yeah.

58:51.340 --> 58:52.641
I promise.

58:54.377 --> 58:55.943
Thanks, Katie.

58:55.945 --> 58:57.012
You're welcome.

59:05.955 --> 59:07.090
I'm sorry, Katie.

59:45.027 --> 59:46.062
Katie...

59:47.463 --> 59:48.965
I need you to do my makeup.

59:52.168 --> 59:54.238
I'm actually not feeling
too good right now.

59:55.905 --> 59:56.939
What's wrong?

59:58.475 --> 01:00:00.208
Nothing. I just...

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:01.677
had a long day at work.

01:00:04.381 --> 01:00:06.915
Well, Bill's coming over.

01:00:06.917 --> 01:00:08.751
I need to look good.

01:00:17.294 --> 01:00:18.827
Okay, just...

01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:20.428
Just give me a minute.

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:21.798
I, I just need a minute.

01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:00.704
Don't move.

01:01:03.308 --> 01:01:04.841
What happened
to your eye?

01:01:05.876 --> 01:01:06.877
Nothing.

01:01:07.778 --> 01:01:09.147
Doesn't look like nothing.

01:01:10.114 --> 01:01:11.182
Well, it was.

01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:20.258
Katie?

01:01:22.125 --> 01:01:23.161
Yeah?

01:01:27.365 --> 01:01:29.901
I'm sorry I haven't been
a very good mother.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.009
I think I'm just not
a very good person.

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:50.822
You're doing your best, and...

01:01:51.489 --> 01:01:52.957
that's what's important.

01:01:58.364 --> 01:01:59.365
Yeah.

01:02:13.445 --> 01:02:14.979
How do I look?

01:02:23.322 --> 01:02:24.823
You look beautiful.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:28.994
You always do.

01:02:33.198 --> 01:02:34.366
Thank you.

01:02:37.936 --> 01:02:39.004
You're welcome.

01:03:02.428 --> 01:03:03.962
Bruno, are you there?

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:13.440
It's me. It's Katie.

01:03:26.119 --> 01:03:27.618
Bruno...

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:28.720
Bruno,
where were you today?

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:31.591
I waited for you at the diner,
but you never came.

01:03:37.598 --> 01:03:39.065
Is everything all right?

01:03:53.313 --> 01:03:54.314
All right.

01:03:57.984 --> 01:04:00.151
I hope I can see you tomorrow.

01:04:00.153 --> 01:04:02.656
I hope I can see you tomorrow
and that you have a good day.

01:04:04.658 --> 01:04:06.093
Good night, Bruno.

01:04:08.461 --> 01:04:09.629
I love you.

01:06:41.617 --> 01:06:43.517
Hey, baby.

01:06:43.519 --> 01:06:45.054
Come here a sec.

01:06:55.232 --> 01:06:56.297
What happened to your eye?

01:06:56.299 --> 01:06:57.300
Nothing.

01:06:59.802 --> 01:07:00.868
Is that from Bruno?

01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:02.636
Mm-mm. No.

01:07:02.638 --> 01:07:04.673
Is it from
one of these guys in here?

01:07:04.675 --> 01:07:05.840
Maybelle, really, it's nothing.

01:07:05.842 --> 01:07:07.542
- Is it your momma?
- No.

01:07:07.544 --> 01:07:08.812
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:07:10.714 --> 01:07:12.549
You know you can tell me, right?

01:07:14.651 --> 01:07:17.519
Oh, my god, Katie.

01:07:17.521 --> 01:07:19.889
Don't ever put up
with anyone hitting you.

01:07:19.891 --> 01:07:21.655
- You hear me?
- Yeah.

01:07:21.657 --> 01:07:22.924
You are too smart for that.

01:07:22.926 --> 01:07:25.225
I know.

01:07:25.227 --> 01:07:27.929
I know you know, but I just...

01:07:27.931 --> 01:07:29.364
Oh, man.

01:07:29.366 --> 01:07:31.566
I just can't help
but worry about you.

01:07:31.568 --> 01:07:32.767
Well, you don't have
to worry about me, boss.

01:07:32.769 --> 01:07:33.770
I'll be fine.

01:07:39.242 --> 01:07:41.211
- Get back to work, okay?
- Okay.

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.879
Of course,
she didn't charge us.

01:07:44.881 --> 01:07:45.947
Did you hear the way
she was moaning?

01:07:45.949 --> 01:07:47.449
She fucking loved it.

01:07:52.322 --> 01:07:54.857
Hey, uh, you think
she ever makes Bruno pay for it?

01:07:54.859 --> 01:07:57.260
I know that Indian hasn't
even fucked her like that.

01:08:02.634 --> 01:08:03.701
What'd you say?

01:08:07.405 --> 01:08:08.536
I said it looks like
you aren't the only one

01:08:08.538 --> 01:08:09.573
getting it on the house.

01:08:29.394 --> 01:08:30.827
Hi, Sara.

01:08:30.828 --> 01:08:31.929
Shut up, Katie.

01:08:34.398 --> 01:08:35.733
Hey, Bruno.
Where you going?

01:08:42.674 --> 01:08:43.774
Where you going?

01:09:02.326 --> 01:09:03.461
Hello, gorgeous.

01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:06.629
Hey, Bear.

01:09:06.631 --> 01:09:08.363
You want the usual?

01:09:08.366 --> 01:09:09.399
Yeah.

01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:19.676
What in the hell
happened to you?

01:09:19.678 --> 01:09:21.310
Uh, it's nothing, Bear.

01:09:21.312 --> 01:09:22.981
It was an accident, that's all.

01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:26.618
Don't look like no accident.

01:09:40.399 --> 01:09:41.399
Katie.

01:09:42.035 --> 01:09:43.033
Can I talk to you?

01:09:43.036 --> 01:09:44.533
- Bruno, what are you doing here?
- Is this him?

01:09:44.535 --> 01:09:45.602
- Katie.
- Did you do that to her?

01:09:45.604 --> 01:09:46.703
Bear, not in here!

01:09:46.705 --> 01:09:47.837
I asked you a question!

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.973
- Did you do that to her?
- No! Stop it!

01:09:49.975 --> 01:09:52.341
- Shut up!
- Don't do that in here!

01:09:52.344 --> 01:09:53.410
- Stop it!
- Bruno!

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.545
Bear?

01:09:55.547 --> 01:09:56.948
You better not hurt her!

01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:59.649
I'm calling the police,
you piece of shit!

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:02.419
Darrel, call the police.

01:10:02.421 --> 01:10:03.621
You fucked them!

01:10:03.623 --> 01:10:06.090
You fucked them, and you said
that you weren't going to!

01:10:06.092 --> 01:10:07.158
Bruno, I meant what I said.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.091
- Then why did you fucking do it?
- I didn't want to!

01:10:08.093 --> 01:10:10.927
- I didn't want to!
- But you did! You did!

01:10:10.929 --> 01:10:12.664
And now I'm fucked
because of you!

01:10:22.742 --> 01:10:23.977
Bruno, what are we doing here?

01:10:34.453 --> 01:10:35.654
Bruno, let's just go home.

01:10:43.663 --> 01:10:44.962
How much do I owe you?

01:10:44.964 --> 01:10:46.063
What?

01:10:46.065 --> 01:10:47.732
How much do I owe you?

01:10:47.734 --> 01:10:48.800
You don't owe me anything.

01:10:48.802 --> 01:10:49.935
Is thirty fair?

01:10:49.937 --> 01:10:51.602
Bruno, I don't want your money.
That's not what this is.

01:10:51.604 --> 01:10:52.938
Thirty-six.

01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:54.507
That's tip
for coming inside.

01:10:56.843 --> 01:10:59.410
Bruno, why are you doing this?

01:10:59.412 --> 01:11:01.045
I thought you love me.

01:11:01.047 --> 01:11:03.115
How would I love you? How?

01:11:03.117 --> 01:11:04.582
- I love you.
- No, you don't.

01:11:04.584 --> 01:11:05.819
- Yeah, I do.
- No, you don't.

01:11:08.588 --> 01:11:10.521
You're a whore, Katie.
You're not meant to be loved.

01:11:13.828 --> 01:11:15.395
You find
your own way back, all right?

01:12:02.576 --> 01:12:03.644
Katie?

01:12:05.046 --> 01:12:06.447
Hello, Mr. Willard.

01:12:11.585 --> 01:12:13.087
I need that rent.

01:12:14.555 --> 01:12:16.523
I know.
I'll get it to you later today.

01:12:26.835 --> 01:12:27.903
Momma?

01:12:38.747 --> 01:12:39.748
Momma?

01:13:01.536 --> 01:13:02.537
Mom?

01:13:59.595 --> 01:14:00.863
Oh, Momma.

01:14:45.242 --> 01:14:47.244
Your mother
told me you wouldn't have it.

01:14:50.281 --> 01:14:52.781
So, I was thinking
that me and you,

01:14:52.783 --> 01:14:56.920
maybe me and you could work out
another arrangement.

01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:08.197
Your mother ran off
with my man.

01:15:08.199 --> 01:15:09.664
- Uh, Katie, you can't walk away
- I know.

01:15:09.666 --> 01:15:10.732
from me like that.

01:15:10.734 --> 01:15:11.467
Your family ain't nothing
but fucking trash.

01:15:11.469 --> 01:15:13.836
We're all trash, Rosa.

01:15:13.838 --> 01:15:15.273
Goddamn it, Katie.

01:15:17.275 --> 01:15:19.241
Now you listen to me, girl.

01:15:19.243 --> 01:15:21.611
You all owe me
for the last month.

01:15:22.679 --> 01:15:24.346
Then take the TV.

01:15:24.348 --> 01:15:27.984
I don't want the TV.
I already got two.

01:15:29.087 --> 01:15:30.752
So then have three.

01:15:30.754 --> 01:15:32.757
What am I
supposed to do now?

01:15:34.826 --> 01:15:36.358
I don't know, Rosa.

01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:37.895
You're gonna have
to figure it out.

01:15:49.807 --> 01:15:52.808
Sheriff just picked up
that boyfriend of yours.

01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:55.046
Caught him out on 89
in a stolen vehicle.

01:15:57.416 --> 01:15:58.649
You like a ride?

01:16:00.219 --> 01:16:01.253
No, thanks.

01:16:02.053 --> 01:16:04.054
Come on. It'll be quick.

01:16:04.056 --> 01:16:05.756
No. I'm not doing that anymore.

01:16:06.959 --> 01:16:07.959
What?

01:16:09.327 --> 01:16:11.162
I said I'm not
doing that anymore.

01:16:13.465 --> 01:16:15.131
Fine then.

01:16:15.133 --> 01:16:16.234
Suit yourself.

01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:32.382
Oh, my god.

01:16:32.384 --> 01:16:34.417
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

01:16:34.419 --> 01:16:36.286
I'm really sorry about
what happened.

01:16:36.288 --> 01:16:37.920
It's fine. It's fine.

01:16:37.922 --> 01:16:39.788
Is... Is Bear okay?

01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:41.191
He's...

01:16:41.193 --> 01:16:43.162
a little bruised up is all.

01:16:45.998 --> 01:16:48.031
- He didn't hurt you, did he?
- No.

01:16:48.033 --> 01:16:49.067
He didn't hurt me.

01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:52.102
Do you mind if I work tonight?

01:16:52.104 --> 01:16:53.770
You don't have to pay me.
I'll just work for tips.

01:16:53.772 --> 01:16:55.106
Oh...

01:16:55.108 --> 01:16:56.939
I just... Actually,
I need to talk to you.

01:16:56.941 --> 01:16:59.878
Could... could you just
give us a second, Sara?

01:17:02.781 --> 01:17:03.815
What is it, boss?

01:17:07.786 --> 01:17:09.420
Um...

01:17:09.422 --> 01:17:14.392
So, 40 dollars went missing
from the register this morning.

01:17:14.394 --> 01:17:15.993
And...

01:17:15.995 --> 01:17:18.697
I asked Sara about it, and...

01:17:19.332 --> 01:17:20.332
Um...

01:17:21.767 --> 01:17:23.534
She...

01:17:23.536 --> 01:17:26.169
She said she saw you
standing by the register.

01:17:26.171 --> 01:17:27.307
She said that...

01:17:28.241 --> 01:17:30.943
she saw you take the 40 dollars.

01:17:32.878 --> 01:17:34.814
I didn't believe her.

01:17:35.915 --> 01:17:37.150
I don't believe her.

01:17:37.784 --> 01:17:39.951
Of course.

01:17:39.953 --> 01:17:42.855
I just have to ask. So...

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:49.295
It's not true, is it?

01:17:57.370 --> 01:17:58.371
Katie?

01:18:07.914 --> 01:18:09.046
Why?

01:18:09.048 --> 01:18:11.816
Why... Why would you do that?

01:18:11.818 --> 01:18:12.950
I don't know, boss.
I don't know.

01:18:12.952 --> 01:18:14.452
I'd give you the money.

01:18:14.454 --> 01:18:16.220
I know.

01:18:19.326 --> 01:18:21.195
- Oh, my god. Darrel is gonna...
- I know.

01:18:28.135 --> 01:18:29.935
Okay. Here's what
we're gonna do.

01:18:29.937 --> 01:18:32.336
- Put the money...
- No, Maybelle. No.

01:18:32.338 --> 01:18:33.437
- Don't. Don't.
- It's all right.

01:18:33.439 --> 01:18:34.807
- Don't.
- It's all right.

01:18:42.549 --> 01:18:45.217
- Thank you for everything.
- Oh...

01:18:45.219 --> 01:18:47.521
I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

01:18:50.190 --> 01:18:52.793
I'll never forget it.

01:18:58.865 --> 01:18:59.932
Um...

01:19:01.635 --> 01:19:04.369
Do you mind
if I keep my uniform?

01:19:04.371 --> 01:19:05.906
It's kind of
all I've got right now.

01:19:06.573 --> 01:19:08.008
Of course. Okay.

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:16.518
Hey, stop that.
I'll be all right.

01:19:17.885 --> 01:19:18.887
Yeah.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.322
You ain't got to worry about me.

01:19:22.156 --> 01:19:23.157
Okay?

01:19:23.658 --> 01:19:24.858
I know.

01:19:27.595 --> 01:19:28.661
Okay. Goodbye.

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:37.105
- Goodbye, Maybelle.
- Yeah.

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:02.465
Don't you ever do that again.

01:20:03.264 --> 01:20:04.300
I won't.

01:22:24.241 --> 01:22:25.643
Okay, here we go.
