00:01.670 --> 00:02.540
Dre: Women.

00:02.540 --> 00:04.250
For generations,

00:04.250 --> 00:06.540
they've worked hard to be seen
as equals in the workplace.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.580
When men went off
to fight World War II,

00:09.580 --> 00:12.170
women stepped up
and took jobs in the factories.

00:12.170 --> 00:13.830
When the men returned home,

00:13.830 --> 00:15.250
they thanked their women

00:15.250 --> 00:17.710
by forcing them
out of the workplace

00:17.710 --> 00:19.380
and back into the home.

00:19.380 --> 00:20.960
But women have proven

00:20.960 --> 00:23.120
they can do everything
men can do,

00:23.120 --> 00:25.250
from the air to the courts

00:25.250 --> 00:26.710
to the Spider Wall.

00:26.710 --> 00:29.960
They can even become
leaders of the free world.

00:29.960 --> 00:32.290
Just not in America.

00:32.290 --> 00:33.920
I was thinking about
all this

00:33.920 --> 00:35.920

Bow's first day back to work

You do something maternal,

Dre, whatever.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.250
Oh.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.380
Is that, uh...
is that a new trend,

08:21.380 --> 08:23.460
'cause I haven't seen that
in, like, anywhere.

08:25.250 --> 08:26.790
Oh, baby.
I had the worst day
ever.

08:26.790 --> 08:28.750
Oh, oh.
The worst!

08:28.750 --> 08:31.880
Holiday Hannah
stabbed me in the back,

08:31.880 --> 08:33.250
and my boobs stabbed me
in the front.

08:33.250 --> 08:34.330
Ow.
God.

08:34.330 --> 08:36.000
Ugh.
Let me get this
for you.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.790
Dre, I've been back to work
so many times.

08:37.790 --> 08:39.380
Why is it so hard
this time?

08:39.380 --> 08:41.880
Well, babe, maybe
it feels this hard now

08:41.880 --> 08:44.620
because you really don't
want to go back to work.

08:44.620 --> 08:47.960

08:47.960 --> 08:49.210
Are you still on this,
Dre?

08:49.210 --> 08:50.830
Okay, okay.
I'll drop it, all right?

08:50.830 --> 08:55.290
I just had one bad day.

08:55.290 --> 08:57.790
Yeah, just --
just one bad day.

08:57.790 --> 09:01.420
You know, I mean,
there must be a ton
of superstars

09:01.420 --> 09:03.460
that have had
a hard first day back.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.500
Yeah, probably.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.500
But not Jordan.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.920
You know,
when he came back,

09:07.920 --> 09:09.040
he dropped 55
on the Knicks.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.500
Look, there must be --

09:10.500 --> 09:11.750
Not Mike Tyson,

09:11.750 --> 09:13.210
because
his first fight back,

09:13.210 --> 09:14.460
he nearly beat a man
to death.

09:14.460 --> 09:17.080
Okay, well, that's...
that's two people.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.460
Tribe Called Quest.

09:18.460 --> 09:20.670
They hadn't had an album
is 20 years,

09:20.670 --> 09:23.540
and then they drop
hot fire.

09:23.540 --> 09:25.880
I mean, it's like
if you're good,
you're good,

09:25.880 --> 09:28.420
and if you're not,
you never had it.

09:32.790 --> 09:34.290
But I have it, Dre.

09:34.290 --> 09:35.920
Hm?
I've always had it!

09:35.920 --> 09:37.620
You know what?
What?

09:37.620 --> 09:39.380
I'm gonna go to work tomorrow,
and I'm gonna kill it.

09:39.380 --> 09:41.000
Okay.
And then I'm gonna
go in the next day,

09:41.000 --> 09:42.330
and I'm gonna kill that,
too,

09:42.330 --> 09:45.000
because you know what,
Dre?
Hm?

09:45.000 --> 09:48.500

09:51.210 --> 09:53.620
I hope you all prepared
for your test today,

09:53.620 --> 09:55.540

09:55.540 --> 09:59.080

my chance at tenure!

09:59.080 --> 10:00.830
If you've done
your homework,

10:00.830 --> 10:03.380
then this should be a breeze,
okay?

10:03.380 --> 10:05.960
Um, Ms. Davis,
I don't know if you heard,

10:05.960 --> 10:08.750
but our cousin was
fatally struck by
gunfire last night

10:08.750 --> 10:09.960
while visiting friends

10:09.960 --> 10:11.500
on the 1400 block
of Southwestern Avenue.

10:11.500 --> 10:12.880
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.290
And our dad
was traded to the Cavs.

10:14.290 --> 10:15.080
What?

10:15.080 --> 10:17.210
Um, when he's in pain,

10:17.210 --> 10:19.210
he likes to pretend
our dad plays in the NBA.

10:19.210 --> 10:20.620
It's a cultural thing.

10:21.710 --> 10:24.000
The hood is so cruel.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.040

10:26.040 --> 10:28.540

for you this week.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.750
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

totally backfired.

And there's only one thing
left to do.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.500
You got
to check your bitch --

10:51.500 --> 10:52.710
What did you say?

10:52.710 --> 10:54.540
I said "pitch."

Another way
to tame a wild bi...
