00:12.400 --> 00:15.280
" Mr. President?"

00:23.537 --> 00:25.553
The president's down!

00:25.649 --> 00:27.698
We need medical assistance!
Help!

00:29.330 --> 00:31.634
Stop that man right there!

00:50.036 --> 00:54.389
The following takes place
between 1.'00 p.m. And 2.'00 p.m.

00:56.117 --> 00:59.061
Events occur in real time.

02:30.655 --> 02:33.312
This is security.
I need help here at the ramp.

02:38.656 --> 02:40.768
All prisoners
in 'A"block are in lockdown.

02:40.864 --> 02:43.009
All prisoners in 'A"block
are in lockdown.

02:48.193 --> 02:50.018
Proceed.

02:51.810 --> 02:55.074
- " Open One."
- "Right here on the screen."

03:03.555 --> 03:06.595
He's clear. Step over there, please.

03:06.691 --> 03:09.412
- Give them I.D.s.
- There you go.

03:09.508 --> 03:11.620
Okay, let's bring
him down now.

03:17.061 --> 03:19.045
Left one rotation for arriving prisoners...

03:19.141 --> 03:23.813
to take place in 10 minutes
at Transport "B,"Site One.

03:23.909 --> 03:25.990
Doctor says let's go.
Right now.

03:26.086 --> 03:27.910
Sick bay.
I don't need to go.

03:28.006 --> 03:30.118
Correctional Officer Clairborn,
"you're needed" at...

03:39.239 --> 03:41.351
Open One!

03:49.160 --> 03:50.984
You okay, Jack?

03:51.080 --> 03:54.025
I won't be okay
until we get this thing signed.

03:54.121 --> 03:56.137
That's not what I meant.

04:13.483 --> 04:15.307
Okay, we're all here.

04:15.403 --> 04:17.226
What kind of changes
are we talking about?

04:17.322 --> 04:19.147
Don't worry, Jack.
They're not deal breakers.

04:19.243 --> 04:22.028
He's still gonna give up
all the terrorist cells he deals with.

04:22.124 --> 04:25.100
He just wants to go to a class two
detention, not maximum security.

04:25.196 --> 04:27.020
- And you're gonna give it to him, right?
- Yeah.

04:27.116 --> 04:29.421
My client's not happy that you
won't hold him in Florida.

04:29.517 --> 04:31.341
He's getting Minnesota.
That's the deal.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.261
Give him Florida.
It doesn't make a difference.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.981
I let you two do your jobs.
Why don't you let me do mine?

04:36.077 --> 04:38.542
Because we don't want this thing
going south over some small detail.

04:38.638 --> 04:41.294
Salazar is unstable, and we can't predict
what's gonna push his buttons.

04:41.390 --> 04:43.214
And to be frank,
there's too much at stake.

04:43.310 --> 04:46.830
Listen, Jack. I know you two spent the last
year getting Salazar, and I respect that.

04:46.926 --> 04:50.543
- "But there's a protocol that
I have to follow..."
- Luis, come here for a second.

04:53.263 --> 04:55.631
Putting him away
is not the point here.

04:55.759 --> 04:57.872
If he doesn't talk,
we haven't accomplished anything.

04:57.968 --> 05:01.264
I didn't lose a year of my life
to arrest some drug dealer.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.440
Salazar does business
with terrorist cells around the world.

05:03.536 --> 05:05.873
Bringing them down is our only objective.
Are we clear?

05:05.969 --> 05:08.369
I understand. But if you give Salazar
everything he asks for...

05:08.465 --> 05:10.289
he's just gonna want more.

05:10.385 --> 05:13.713
This is the deal,
and he's going to take it.

05:13.841 --> 05:15.666
Here.

05:22.642 --> 05:24.915
You better be right.

05:26.227 --> 05:29.939
Douglas, is that my life
you're holding in your hands?

05:30.035 --> 05:32.308
It's ready
to be signed.

05:34.484 --> 05:38.068
- Are you in there, Jack?
- " Forget about Bauer."

05:39.380 --> 05:41.877
How can I forget about the man
who put me here?

05:41.973 --> 05:43.797
He pretended
to be my friend.

05:46.133 --> 05:49.077
I'm concerned
about you, Jack.

05:49.173 --> 05:51.542
The things you did
to get me here...

05:51.638 --> 05:53.462
I wouldn't wish on anyone.

05:53.558 --> 05:56.502
Let's face it...
you'll never be the same.

05:56.598 --> 05:59.671
Hey, neither will I.

05:59.767 --> 06:02.295
So, I guess we are
in the same boat.

06:04.407 --> 06:07.031
I'm about to
name names, Jack.

06:07.127 --> 06:09.336
This is a big moment
for both of us.

06:09.432 --> 06:12.280
That makes me happy.

06:12.376 --> 06:15.864
Because, you see,
we are connected now.

06:17.081 --> 06:20.697
I don't know.
Maybe we always have been.

06:25.081 --> 06:28.538
- I marked the changes.
- I don't need to see the changes.

06:28.634 --> 06:32.634
But I do need a pen. Unless you want me
to sign it with my own blood.

06:32.730 --> 06:36.635
That's kind of funny... my own blood.

06:38.459 --> 06:41.179
Where do I sign this,
Douglas?

06:41.275 --> 06:43.835
Right here.

06:46.076 --> 06:48.444
You've done a good job
as my counsel.

06:48.540 --> 06:50.364
You've been
a go-to guy...

06:50.460 --> 06:52.508
as they like to say
here in the States.

06:52.604 --> 06:54.461
But I think
they're on to you.

06:54.557 --> 06:57.629
And I don't think you have
what it takes to keep your mouth shut.

06:57.725 --> 07:01.245
What do you mean?

07:01.341 --> 07:03.838
Son of a bitch.

07:03.934 --> 07:06.270
Open the door!
Open the door!

07:07.518 --> 07:10.078
Do it now!

07:13.183 --> 07:16.319
Get a medic
in here now!

07:16.415 --> 07:20.128
This is your fault, Jack.
And what happens next is on you too.

07:20.224 --> 07:22.144
What's that mean, huh?
Is that a threat?

07:22.240 --> 07:24.544
- Chase!
- You son of a bitch!

07:24.640 --> 07:27.008
Back off!
Take a walk!

07:30.145 --> 07:32.833
Did you hear me?

07:32.929 --> 07:34.785
Did you hear me?

07:36.065 --> 07:38.530
What happens next
is on you, Jack.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.706
It's on you!

07:49.731 --> 07:51.907
Dr. Macer, we isolated
the body like you asked.

07:52.003 --> 07:53.827
You said my name
was on it?

07:53.923 --> 07:55.939
Yes, it's on his chest.

08:07.461 --> 08:09.605
Run a full panel of tests
just to be sure...

08:09.701 --> 08:12.485
but I think we're dealing with
a pneumonic virus, type three.

08:12.581 --> 08:16.806
Type three? Isn't that the virus group
your team has been doing simulations on?

08:16.902 --> 08:20.422
Yeah. I think that's why this was addressed
to me. Has C.T.U. been contacted yet?

08:20.518 --> 08:23.111
- "No, we've been waiting for you."
- Go ahead and start the preliminary tests.

08:23.207 --> 08:25.799
- I'll call Director Almeida.
- "All right."

08:29.703 --> 08:32.456
- Hey, did the president arrive at S.C. Yet?
- Just about.

08:32.552 --> 08:35.400
We're swapping out some of our people
now that Secret Service is in place.

08:35.496 --> 08:39.880
- They're waiting for your resource assessment.
- I'll call them.

08:39.976 --> 08:43.241
- I've had it, Tony. I swear to God.
- What's the problem, Adam?

08:43.337 --> 08:45.513
Chloe O'Brian
does not touch my data.

08:45.609 --> 08:48.905
If Field Ops wants something, she asks Jack
or talks to you, and then you tell me.

08:49.001 --> 08:52.074
- Did she damage anything?
- That's not the point.

08:52.170 --> 08:55.082
The reason my department
has zero downtime...

08:55.178 --> 08:57.642
- is because of procedures I put in place.
- Did she damage anything?

08:57.738 --> 09:00.779
- No, she didn't.
- Then let it go. Jack's got his department...

09:00.875 --> 09:04.619
and I got mine, but we're all
under the same roof, understood?

09:04.715 --> 09:07.275
Good.
Now lighten up.

09:07.371 --> 09:10.540
You're gonna drive yourself
and the rest of us crazy.

09:13.772 --> 09:16.588
All right, hold on.

09:16.684 --> 09:18.733
Sunny Macer from Health Services
is on the line.

09:18.829 --> 09:21.421
Oh, uh, by the way,
have you heard from Hertzog?

09:21.517 --> 09:23.597
No, not yet.

09:25.293 --> 09:27.214
Relax, Michelle.
You're gonna get the job.

09:27.310 --> 09:29.646
I better. You're not going
to Langley without me.

09:31.342 --> 09:33.198
Hey, Sunny.
What's up?

09:33.294 --> 09:35.663
Well, this is one
I'm really sorry to be right about.

09:35.759 --> 09:37.807
- What are you talking about?
- The Cordilla virus.

09:37.903 --> 09:40.527
It's a type three pneumonic virus.
Remember last month at the conference...

09:40.623 --> 09:43.023
I raised the possibility
a strain could be out there?

09:43.151 --> 09:44.560
Yeah.

09:44.656 --> 09:47.504
It is. Someone just dropped off
a dead body infected with the virus.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.128
These guys are serious. They blew
a hole in the door to get our attention.

09:50.224 --> 09:52.048
This is obviously
some kind of message.

09:52.144 --> 09:54.353
A message? What,
that somebody's got the virus...

09:54.449 --> 09:56.785
- and they're willing to release it?
- Yeah, exactly.

09:56.881 --> 09:59.601
Do we need to issue
a quarantine advisory?

09:59.697 --> 10:02.290
No, once the host is dead,
it's not contagious.

10:02.386 --> 10:04.882
All right, do me a favor.
Call the other county facilities.

10:04.978 --> 10:06.866
- See if there are more cases.
- I will.

10:06.962 --> 10:08.690
What about the I.D.
On the John Doe?

10:08.786 --> 10:10.578
Send everything over here.
We'll work it up.

10:10.674 --> 10:14.323
- It's on its way.
- Thanks, Sunny.

10:14.419 --> 10:16.499
What is it?

10:16.595 --> 10:18.579
Initiate a level one
setting protocol.

10:22.644 --> 10:25.588
I don't think you have
what it takes to keep your mouth shut.

10:25.684 --> 10:28.180
What do you mean?

10:31.477 --> 10:33.781
If Salazar wanted to kill Shaye, he
could've anytime over the last three months.

10:33.877 --> 10:36.469
- "Why'd he pick today?"
- He was cutting his deal.

10:36.565 --> 10:39.286
Maybe,
but I don't think so.

10:39.382 --> 10:42.486
This is your fault, Jack.
What happens next is on you too.

10:47.511 --> 10:49.815
"What happens next"?

10:55.287 --> 10:57.112
- C.T.U.
- This is Bauer.

10:57.208 --> 10:59.224
- Patch me through to Almeida.
- Hold on.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.720
- "Hey, Jack."
- "Tony, is anything going on over there?"

11:01.848 --> 11:03.672
We just had
a major protocol come in.

11:03.768 --> 11:07.321
- Possible bio-threat to the city.
- Tell me about it.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.873
Well, a dead body infected with the
Cordilla virus was left at Health Services.

11:10.969 --> 11:12.793
We figure it's just
the first shoe dropping.

11:12.889 --> 11:15.066
We're waiting for somebody
to take responsibility.

11:16.570 --> 11:18.586
- Jack?
- Yeah.

11:18.682 --> 11:20.538
You thinking this is
connected to Salazar?

11:20.634 --> 11:24.635
I don't know.
I don't know, maybe.

11:24.731 --> 11:26.299
- I'll get back to you.
- All right.

11:29.659 --> 11:32.156
- I need copies of all four images.
- Right away.

12:21.633 --> 12:23.777
- Hello, Mr. President.
- Wayne.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.114
- Are we ready for the run-through?
- Yeah, almost.

12:26.210 --> 12:29.442
The advance team dropped the ball,
so we can't get in there for a few minutes.

12:29.538 --> 12:31.522
- That's fine.
- No. No, it's not fine, David.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.442
I fired Judy.
It was her fault.

12:33.538 --> 12:35.715
She's done some good work
for us, hasn't she?

12:35.811 --> 12:38.083
Listen. Tonight's
debate is critical.

12:38.179 --> 12:40.867
And she should have had
every single base covered, but she didn't.

12:42.883 --> 12:45.796
Mr. President, how do you feel about
tonight's debate with Senator Keeler?

12:45.892 --> 12:48.164
Confident.
Ready to go.

12:48.260 --> 12:51.108
Sir, this is your first time back to
Los Angeles since the attempt on your life.

12:51.236 --> 12:53.060
Were you uneasy
about coming back?

12:53.157 --> 12:55.909
Not at all.
Los Angeles is a great city.

12:56.005 --> 12:58.725
Would've been back here sooner
if events had allowed it.

12:58.821 --> 13:02.950
What is important is that
we're here now, looking to the future.

13:03.046 --> 13:05.766
Thank you. That's, uh, all for now.

13:05.862 --> 13:08.198
We'll have a formal "Q' and "A"
later this afternoon. You'll be briefed.

13:08.294 --> 13:11.175
David, we gotta talk
about those G.A.O. numbers.

13:11.271 --> 13:13.127
Keeler's gonna bring it up tonight.
You know he is.

13:13.223 --> 13:16.071
And I'm just not really...
David?

13:17.127 --> 13:20.071
- David, you all right?
- I'm fine.

13:21.928 --> 13:24.264
Let me call one of
the resident doctors, all right?

13:24.360 --> 13:27.048
No, it's all right.
I'll wait for Anne.

13:39.882 --> 13:42.538
- Where are you going, Jack?
We have to talk about this.
- Not now.

13:42.634 --> 13:45.482
- Then when?
- Call me. Right now we gotta
get back to C.T.U.

13:45.610 --> 13:48.363
- Why?
- Salazar killed Shaye for a reason.

13:48.459 --> 13:51.243
He picked today to do it.
We gotta find out why.

13:51.339 --> 13:54.187
Fine. Let's just go back in there
and put the screws on Salazar.

13:54.283 --> 13:56.972
You think he's gonna talk to us
after what we just watched him do?

13:57.068 --> 13:58.956
Not a chance.
Come on. Let's go.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.028
Jack.

14:02.124 --> 14:04.428
Just call me.

14:16.590 --> 14:19.150
All right, so what else did Almeida
say about this dead body?

14:19.246 --> 14:22.414
Jack.

14:22.510 --> 14:26.031
- What?
- I asked you about Tony. What else did he say?

14:26.127 --> 14:28.751
He said the body was dumped at Health
Services. They're trying to I.D. it.

14:31.855 --> 14:33.840
You know, you never
answered me before.

14:35.312 --> 14:38.032
- About how you're doing.
- What are you talking about?

14:38.128 --> 14:40.496
You know what
I'm talking about.

14:45.457 --> 14:47.409
- This is Bauer.
- Jack, it's Chloe.

14:47.505 --> 14:49.777
I have Kate Warner for you.
Should I put her through?

14:49.873 --> 14:53.938
Uh, yeah,
put her through.

14:54.034 --> 14:55.858
- Jack?
- Kate.

14:55.954 --> 15:00.691
I just wanted to let you know I found that
leather jacket you thought you'd lost.

15:00.787 --> 15:03.155
Oh. Uh, okay. Great.

15:03.283 --> 15:05.651
So, uh, what do
you wanna do?

15:05.779 --> 15:08.115
I can bring it over
or send it.

15:08.212 --> 15:11.252
No, you don't have to do that. Look.
I'll just send someone over to pick it up.

15:11.348 --> 15:13.332
- You sure?
- Yeah.

15:14.932 --> 15:18.581
- Okay, then.
- Kate. How are you?

15:20.949 --> 15:23.829
You know, it's hard.

15:23.925 --> 15:25.941
I miss you.

15:28.438 --> 15:30.998
I'm really,
really sorry.

15:31.094 --> 15:33.238
Don't be.

15:33.334 --> 15:35.703
- Take care of yourself, Kate.
- Bye.

15:37.751 --> 15:40.215
- How's Kate?
- She's all right.

15:40.311 --> 15:42.135
So, you guys
are still talking?

15:42.231 --> 15:44.087
- No, not really.
- "All right."

15:44.184 --> 15:46.808
- None of my business. Sorry.
- I didn't mean it like that.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.016
She's just trying to return
a couple things of mine. That's all.

15:52.856 --> 15:54.969
You got any water?

15:57.465 --> 15:59.833
Talk to Sunny. She was gonna
check with the other facilities...

15:59.961 --> 16:01.785
to see if there were
any more cases.

16:01.881 --> 16:03.706
If there are,
find out where.

16:03.802 --> 16:05.690
Also, let's take
all the regional cells...

16:05.786 --> 16:08.922
that have bio-terrorist capabilities
and put them into high-speed cache.

16:09.018 --> 16:11.002
Okay.

16:11.098 --> 16:14.203
Tony, it's
Larry Hertzog from Langley on line two.

16:19.227 --> 16:21.084
Yeah, Larry.

16:22.972 --> 16:24.924
Yeah, we are.

16:25.020 --> 16:27.164
- Sorry, there's just no...
- Uh-huh.

16:27.260 --> 16:29.405
Tony, I need an answer
from you by end of day.

16:29.501 --> 16:31.645
- Uh-huh.
- Tell Michelle I'm sorry.

16:31.741 --> 16:34.109
Yeah, I will.
Thanks.

16:35.325 --> 16:37.149
Was that about me?

16:37.245 --> 16:40.446
Yeah. He doesn't have
a job for you right now.

16:40.542 --> 16:43.838
There's no new funding
until after the election.

16:43.934 --> 16:46.142
Oh, I see.

16:47.679 --> 16:49.791
Also, uh...

16:49.887 --> 16:53.663
Larry told me he needs an answer from me
by the end of the day.

16:54.751 --> 16:57.248
They're in a hurry
to fill the post.

16:59.744 --> 17:03.168
We both know you can't pass this up.
It's a major career move.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.464
Call him
and tell him it's yes.

17:10.625 --> 17:12.449
And you'll come along
as the wife...

17:12.545 --> 17:14.369
without a job?

17:15.586 --> 17:17.954
I'll go anywhere with you.

17:19.842 --> 17:22.530
As long as
I don't have to cook.

17:25.795 --> 17:29.347
Sweetheart, if you promise not to cook,
I will take you with me anywhere.

17:30.851 --> 17:34.756
But, uh, if they don't have a job for you,
I'm not interested.

17:34.852 --> 17:38.916
"Tony, Homeland Security on line one."

17:39.012 --> 17:41.221
We'll talk about it later.

17:41.317 --> 17:44.165
Almeida.

17:44.293 --> 17:48.101
Pretty much. I just have to
refresh the data on my panel.

17:48.229 --> 17:50.053
- Thanks.
- Hey, Kim.

17:50.149 --> 17:52.326
- Yes, Michelle.
- Have you ever done a capability search?

17:52.422 --> 17:54.310
A couple weeks ago,
I did one for Tony.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.230
- The East European cells?
- Yes.

17:56.326 --> 17:59.463
Good. This one's different.
It's gonna be global.

17:59.559 --> 18:01.895
Here's my access code.

18:01.991 --> 18:03.815
- I'll get right on it.
- Thanks.

18:09.736 --> 18:12.712
Hey, Adam, does the link file
have D.E.S. Encryptions?

18:12.808 --> 18:15.144
No, it's two-key.

18:16.392 --> 18:19.433
- What volume is the filter on?
- Etudes Seven.

18:19.529 --> 18:21.097
Thank you.

18:21.193 --> 18:23.017
You're welcome.

18:45.804 --> 18:47.692
Are you saying
you had to break me?

18:53.773 --> 18:55.629
No, "mi angel."

18:55.725 --> 18:59.437
It was you
who break me.

19:25.296 --> 19:27.120
Si, senor.

19:30.065 --> 19:31.889
- Okay, it's coming up now.
- I'm sending it to you.

19:31.985 --> 19:33.937
- Thanks, Chris.
- Okay.

19:34.033 --> 19:37.329
- Adam, I'm piping this over to your system.
- What is it?

19:37.457 --> 19:40.210
Frags on the body
that was dropped off at Health Services.

19:40.306 --> 19:44.242
We're doing an I.D. Analysis. Kim,
where are you on the capability search?

19:44.338 --> 19:46.386
Still running.
It's gonna be another 15 minutes.

19:46.482 --> 19:48.307
- So, you're open?
- Yeah. What do you need?

19:48.403 --> 19:50.227
Adam's gonna break off part of an I.D.
We need a name.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.371
- Give her the D.N.A. File.
- Michelle, I don't need her help.

19:52.467 --> 19:55.027
Yes, you do.
This is urgent.

20:02.580 --> 20:04.724
I'm ready, Adam.
Send the file.

20:06.869 --> 20:08.693
I'm open, Adam.
Send me the file.

20:08.789 --> 20:11.093
- No.
- Michelle just told you...

20:11.189 --> 20:13.237
I don't need anyone
doing my work for me.

20:13.333 --> 20:14.998
What is your problem?

20:15.094 --> 20:17.238
My problem is that everyone
in this place earned their job.

20:17.334 --> 20:19.222
You got it
'cause of your dad.

20:29.143 --> 20:31.287
What the hell is this?

20:38.584 --> 20:41.817
Tracy, is your system locked?

20:41.913 --> 20:44.377
- No, it's not.
- Okay, thanks.

20:46.617 --> 20:50.041
You know it could be that you forgot
to set the group permission...

20:50.137 --> 20:53.018
and someone who knows
the tree structure changed the ownership.

20:53.146 --> 20:55.450
But that wouldn't be me,
because I'm incompetent...

20:55.546 --> 20:58.042
and only got this job
because of my dad.

20:59.194 --> 21:01.019
Change the ownership
back, Kim.

21:01.115 --> 21:02.971
Send the data fork.

21:05.947 --> 21:07.995
It's your ass.
Michelle's waiting.

21:13.148 --> 21:16.220
Fine. I'll send it.
Just unlock my system.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.205
No problem.

21:28.894 --> 21:31.422
- Hey, Jack, I'll be up in a minute.
- Okay.

21:32.702 --> 21:35.263
Chloe, give me
what you got.

21:37.375 --> 21:39.199
Are we in sync with
all the systems downstairs?

21:39.295 --> 21:41.631
Everything Health Services
sent on the body is in volume one...

21:41.727 --> 21:45.024
and I've reprised
all the Salazar information you wanted.

21:45.152 --> 21:47.744
- Where are the date keys?
- I couldn't get those for you.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.496
- Why not?
- You'll have to talk to Tony
so that Tony can tell Adam...

21:50.592 --> 21:53.088
- and Adam can give them to me.
- You're kidding me, right?

21:53.184 --> 21:56.129
Nope. Adam's completely anal about
that kind of stuff, and he hates women.

21:58.529 --> 22:01.729
Chloe, just get it for me,
okay, please?

22:03.586 --> 22:06.050
And close my door.

22:39.078 --> 22:40.838
- Yeah.
- "Jack, it's Michelle."

22:40.934 --> 22:44.006
The teleconference with Health Services is
about to start. You might wanna come down.

22:44.102 --> 22:46.662
Uh, no, I'm gonna stay up here.
Just patch 'em through, okay?

22:46.758 --> 22:48.743
- "Okay."
- Thanks.

23:31.883 --> 23:36.076
You scared me.

23:36.172 --> 23:38.988
What are you doing in here?

23:39.084 --> 23:43.565
I am refreshing
a drive.

23:43.661 --> 23:46.157
What's going on
with Salazar?

23:46.253 --> 23:48.621
- Were you there when it happened?
- Yeah.

23:48.717 --> 23:51.054
Yeah, it was
pretty crazy.

23:52.494 --> 23:54.670
How's my dad taking it?

23:54.766 --> 23:57.070
- He's okay.
- Good.

23:57.166 --> 23:59.759
'Cause I was thinking
about talking to him today.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.839
Uh-huh.

24:01.935 --> 24:04.239
Okay, today might not
be the best day.

24:04.335 --> 24:06.479
Chase, no day
is a good day.

24:06.575 --> 24:09.872
We said that we would tell him
if we were still together after two months.

24:09.968 --> 24:13.232
It's almost three. Why don't
we just tell him and get it over with?

24:16.208 --> 24:19.089
All right.

24:19.217 --> 24:22.225
But I'll do it.
Okay?

24:24.657 --> 24:27.474
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

24:27.570 --> 24:29.202
- Really?
- Really.

24:36.275 --> 24:38.099
Okay, um, look.
You can't put the drives in there.

24:38.195 --> 24:40.563
- What I need you to do is look under...
- F-6, right?

24:40.691 --> 24:42.355
Yeah. Thanks.

24:46.356 --> 24:48.404
We just received results
of more tests, Tony.

24:48.500 --> 24:52.276
Unfortunately, the news isn't good.
This is a weaponized strain.

24:52.404 --> 24:54.261
The virus has been engineered
to kill more rapidly.

24:54.357 --> 24:57.365
- How rapidly?
- It's a bit of a guess...

24:57.461 --> 25:01.301
but based on the autopsy, if infection
starts at "T" equals zero hours...

25:01.429 --> 25:04.150
there's a noncontagious
latency period of 14 hours.

25:04.246 --> 25:08.822
After 14, it presents,
after 20, the host is incapacitated.

25:08.918 --> 25:10.806
By 24,
the host is dead.

25:14.167 --> 25:16.663
What are the epidemiological
consequences?

25:16.759 --> 25:19.095
If the virus initiates
at a single location...

25:19.191 --> 25:21.912
There will be a couple hundred cases
by the end of day one.

25:22.008 --> 25:24.216
By the end of day two,
it could be in the thousands.

25:24.312 --> 25:27.928
But from there, it's easier to talk about
in percentage of population.

25:28.024 --> 25:32.633
By the end of the first week, nine percent
of Los Angeles County will be infected.

25:32.729 --> 25:36.025
Nine percent?
That's over a million people.

25:36.121 --> 25:39.322
And those people will die
within 24 hours of infection.

25:41.146 --> 25:43.994
Tell me, if someone
were gonna try to release this virus...

25:44.090 --> 25:47.803
into the general population,
how would they do it?

25:47.899 --> 25:51.451
That's the million-dollar question.
It could come from anywhere.

25:51.547 --> 25:54.747
We don't know who has it. There's no way
to know where they plan to release it.

25:54.843 --> 25:58.140
We don't even know
what form it's in.

26:11.453 --> 26:13.757
" Kyle?"

26:13.853 --> 26:15.678
What, Ma?

26:17.982 --> 26:20.798
Tim wants you to know
that he's down at the pool.

26:20.894 --> 26:23.551
Thanks, Ma.

26:23.647 --> 26:25.791
Can you take me to the doctor
later on this afternoon?

26:27.167 --> 26:29.791
- What's Dad doing?
- On a job interview.

26:29.887 --> 26:32.736
- Fingers crossed.
- Fingers crossed.

26:33.952 --> 26:36.448
Can Aunt Norma take you?

26:36.544 --> 26:38.688
Why, what's so important
that you can't take me?

26:38.784 --> 26:40.448
I mean...

26:40.544 --> 26:43.393
It's just that I got a bunch of stuff
to do today, Ma. Sorry.

26:47.457 --> 26:49.249
Fine.
I'll call Norma.

26:49.345 --> 26:53.122
Thanks.
Love you, Ma.

27:07.619 --> 27:10.756
Mr. President, the country was
in shock after the attempt on your life.

27:10.852 --> 27:13.988
But its prayers were answered
when it was clear that you would survive.

27:14.084 --> 27:18.629
That said, many Americans have expressed
concern that you are not fully recovered...

27:18.725 --> 27:22.021
and may not be strong enough
to serve for four more years.

27:22.117 --> 27:24.645
How would you respond
to those who make such claims?

27:24.741 --> 27:27.206
I wake up every morning
at 5:00 a.m.

27:27.302 --> 27:29.446
I spend the first hour
in the weight room.

27:29.542 --> 27:32.518
While I'm exercising,
I'm prepping for my morning meetings.

27:32.614 --> 27:34.694
- "And then I put in a 16-hour day."
- Hold on!

27:36.071 --> 27:37.895
Uh, could we pause
the video, please?

27:37.991 --> 27:40.039
Get ready
to play it back.

27:40.135 --> 27:42.183
Sorry, Chuck, hold on.

27:42.279 --> 27:45.096
Don't dignify that question
with a defensive response.

27:45.192 --> 27:48.456
I didn't realize that stating
the facts was being defensive.

27:48.552 --> 27:51.336
They bring up the assassination attempt?
Fine. Let 'em.

27:51.432 --> 27:53.769
Then you remind everyone that
it was your administration...

27:53.865 --> 27:56.265
that not only arrested the man
behind the attempt on your life...

27:56.393 --> 27:59.689
but you also exposed his organization
and put his top-tier people away as well.

27:59.785 --> 28:03.210
All this while you were in
this so-called "weakened state."

28:03.306 --> 28:05.994
Keeler would be lucky
to have a fraction of your energy.

28:06.090 --> 28:08.330
That's what you tell 'em.

28:08.426 --> 28:10.538
Mr. President.
Go ahead, Chuck.

28:10.634 --> 28:12.619
And Mom called him
the timid brother.

28:16.075 --> 28:18.571
Ah, there's my doctor.
How are you?

28:18.667 --> 28:21.484
- Mr. President.
- "All right, everyone."
Let's break for a few minutes.

28:21.580 --> 28:23.628
I'm fine.
How's he been?

28:23.724 --> 28:26.860
- He seems a little tired.
- I am not tired.

28:26.956 --> 28:29.613
- I'm just a little jet-lagged.
- How's this going?

28:29.709 --> 28:31.885
I'm definitely winning
the run-through.

28:49.391 --> 28:52.975
130 over 80.

28:53.071 --> 28:56.143
Good.
This is Wayne Palmer.

28:56.239 --> 28:58.448
- How tired?
- I'm fine.

28:58.544 --> 29:01.392
We haven't done a work up
on you in a while and I'd really like...

29:01.520 --> 29:03.344
No, no, no, no,
no tests.

29:03.440 --> 29:07.025
You start looking for something,
and you don't stop until you find it.

29:07.121 --> 29:09.585
I'm fine, Anne.

29:09.681 --> 29:13.937
Okay. But when you get back to D.C.,
I want you to have a complete physical.

29:14.033 --> 29:17.650
- Doctor's orders.
- Yes, ma'am.

29:17.746 --> 29:21.906
Anne? I need him alone
for a minute.

29:22.002 --> 29:24.147
He's all yours.

29:24.243 --> 29:27.059
- What is it?
- I just received a very
disturbing phone call...

29:27.155 --> 29:28.979
from Health Services.

29:29.075 --> 29:31.347
It seems they found a body
here in Los Angeles that's been infected...

29:31.443 --> 29:33.908
with an extremely contagious
and deadly virus.

29:34.004 --> 29:37.716
- Now, there's a concern this is
not just a random occurrence.
- Meaning what?

29:37.812 --> 29:39.636
Meaning C.T.U. Is looking
into the possibility...

29:39.732 --> 29:42.101
that this could be
a criminal action.

29:42.229 --> 29:44.981
Criminal action?
Based on this one death?

29:45.077 --> 29:46.933
I don't know
all the details, David...

29:47.029 --> 29:50.774
but it has to do with the circumstances
under which the body was found.

29:50.870 --> 29:52.790
Keep your eye
on this one.

29:52.918 --> 29:55.382
Okay.

29:55.478 --> 29:58.998
Chuck, can we go down to question number
seven, please, about Homeland Security?

30:05.079 --> 30:07.159
- Chloe.
- "Yes."

30:07.255 --> 30:09.272
Where are the transcripts
of Salazar and the D.A?

30:09.368 --> 30:11.832
- I sent them to your system.
It's in your directory.
- Damn it.

30:11.928 --> 30:15.064
I didn't want it in my directory. I want
it with the rest of the files from Salazar.

30:15.160 --> 30:17.433
Okay, I'll do it.

30:21.273 --> 30:24.153
Chloe, listen to me. If you can't start
getting things right the first time...

30:24.281 --> 30:26.105
just let me know 'cause
I can get someone who can.

30:26.201 --> 30:28.986
If you wanted it saved with the
other files, you should have said so.

30:29.082 --> 30:31.482
That isn't standard, so I wouldn't think
of doing it that way, would I?

30:31.610 --> 30:34.458
- Just do it that way from now on, okay?
- I can't read minds, Jack.

30:34.554 --> 30:37.115
You're gonna have to spell it out for me,
otherwise this relationship...

30:37.211 --> 30:40.795
- Damn it, Chloe, just do it now!
- Fine.

31:00.413 --> 31:02.782
- Hey, Jack.
- What?

31:02.910 --> 31:06.526
- What was that all about?
- I need you to replace Chloe for me.

31:06.622 --> 31:09.822
Replace her?
She's the best analyst we got.

31:09.918 --> 31:11.839
- No, she's not. She's slow.
- She's not slow.

31:11.967 --> 31:15.199
I mean, she may be a little weird,
but she knows her stuff.

31:19.903 --> 31:22.272
You look like hell.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.408
What did you
just say to me?

31:26.688 --> 31:29.729
We're on an active protocol, okay?
I need to know if you're up for it or not.

31:33.633 --> 31:36.129
I like working with you, Chase.
You're a nice kid.

31:36.225 --> 31:39.874
But don't you ever come into my office
and talk to me like that again, understand?

31:41.730 --> 31:43.554
I'm just saying
you're on edge.

31:43.650 --> 31:47.491
Okay? I mean, come on, man.
You're about to fire Chloe for no reason.

31:56.612 --> 31:58.916
- Chloe.
- Yes?

31:59.012 --> 32:03.364
I'm sorry I took your head off.
I'm just having a bad morning, okay?

32:03.492 --> 32:05.861
- Thanks.
- "Yeah."

32:06.949 --> 32:09.637
You happy?

32:11.685 --> 32:14.534
Look, Jack. There's one more thing
I gotta talk to you about.

32:17.542 --> 32:20.646
- This is Bauer.
- "Jack, we got something new"
on Salazar.

32:20.742 --> 32:22.566
Okay, we'll be
right down.

32:22.662 --> 32:25.255
They got something
on Salazar.

32:26.855 --> 32:28.679
What do you wanna tell me?

32:29.767 --> 32:31.591
Nothing. It'll hold.

32:32.648 --> 32:35.272
Good.

32:37.352 --> 32:39.592
So, in order to plug
any possible security breaches...

32:39.688 --> 32:41.513
we're doing date checks
from now on.

32:41.609 --> 32:44.457
Break your logs
into eight-hour intervals.

32:44.585 --> 32:46.409
Put different encryption keys
on each interval...

32:46.505 --> 32:48.393
so if one is breached,
one won't bleed into the other.

32:48.489 --> 32:50.377
- Did you tell him?
- No. There's a lot going on right now.

32:50.506 --> 32:52.874
- It'll happen though. I promise.
- " Get back to work."

32:55.210 --> 32:57.994
An anonymous phone call just came
into the F.B.I. About 10 minutes ago.

32:58.090 --> 33:00.683
- They're getting ready
to stream it to us right now.
- Did you hear it?

33:00.779 --> 33:03.755
- Yeah.
- Okay, it's ready.

33:03.851 --> 33:05.771
Bring it up.

33:05.899 --> 33:08.203
By now you've received our package...

33:08.299 --> 33:13.068
and realize we're in possession of a type
three pulmonary immuno-virus.

33:13.196 --> 33:15.820
Listen very carefully
to these instructions.

33:15.916 --> 33:18.285
Our demand is very simple.

33:18.413 --> 33:21.165
We want the release
of Ramon Salazar...

33:21.261 --> 33:24.717
in the next six hours.

33:24.813 --> 33:28.878
If you refuse to comply, the virus will
be unleashed to the general population.

33:28.974 --> 33:30.798
As your experts
will tell you...

33:30.894 --> 33:34.094
you will not have time
to stop its spread.

33:34.190 --> 33:36.783
Details on how Ramon
is to be delivered will follow.

33:36.879 --> 33:38.607
That's it.

33:38.703 --> 33:41.359
- Do we know where the phone
call originated from?
- We don't know yet.

33:41.455 --> 33:43.855
It came out of a scrambled satellite signal.
We're trying to narrow it down.

33:43.983 --> 33:46.576
Jack, you know Salazar
better than anybody else here.

33:46.672 --> 33:49.232
- Who do you think we're dealing with?
- Without a doubt, his brother.

33:49.328 --> 33:53.521
Hector was next in command.
He went underground the second Ramon
was taken into custody.

33:53.617 --> 33:56.625
Now look, I know for a fact that the
Salazars own multiple properties...

33:56.721 --> 33:59.441
in South America and Mexico,
registered under dummy corporations.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.841
Unfortunately, right now
the Mexican government...

34:01.937 --> 34:03.762
is saying
they can't locate them.

34:03.858 --> 34:07.122
So we're gonna have to throw out a pretty large
net to try and trace the origin of that call.

34:07.218 --> 34:10.610
- All right. We'll work on it.
- Okay. How we doing with
the I.D. on the dead body?

34:10.737 --> 34:13.619
- Michelle is running the DNA.
- What about prints and dental?

34:13.746 --> 34:16.371
- No teeth, no fingertips.
- Look. We need this I.D.

34:16.467 --> 34:18.835
It's the only hook we've got
into their operation.

34:18.963 --> 34:21.652
- What about questioning Salazar?
- Complete waste of time.

34:21.748 --> 34:23.572
This is a man
without vulnerability.

34:23.668 --> 34:25.748
He doesn't respond
to physical interrogation...

34:25.844 --> 34:28.692
and he doesn't care about another living soul,
including his own children.

34:28.820 --> 34:31.092
Tony, we have a match
on John Doe.

34:35.349 --> 34:38.357
- Show us what you got.
- The dead body is a David Goss.

34:38.453 --> 34:41.366
He's a street dealer in East L.A.,
also an informant.

34:41.494 --> 34:44.949
He flipped sides so many times, D.E.A. Stopped
working with him over a year ago.

34:45.045 --> 34:47.254
- Do we have a last-known address?
- We're working on it.

34:47.350 --> 34:50.007
We need to know who infected Goss.
You're gonna have to work up a list...

34:50.103 --> 34:52.695
of everyone who's been
involved in his life over the last week.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.647
We'll pull together everything
we can get our hands on.

34:54.743 --> 34:56.856
Work it from the other side.
Go through Salazar's network.

34:56.952 --> 34:59.672
See if you can find the supplier
who sold to Goss. Good work.

34:59.768 --> 35:03.032
Chase, come with me.
Let's see if anything's come in on Hector.

36:33.570 --> 36:36.483
Why do you have my father
doing this kind of work for you?

36:36.611 --> 36:39.075
It's not his job.

36:39.171 --> 36:41.443
It is today.

36:58.565 --> 37:01.797
Why did you kill Shaye?

37:01.893 --> 37:05.158
Take a look around, Ramon.
You're in a United States prison...

37:05.254 --> 37:08.838
where your ass is going to rot
until you're executed.

37:08.934 --> 37:12.487
You wanna improve your conditions here?
Better start talking to me.

37:12.583 --> 37:15.143
What do you want
to talk about?

37:15.239 --> 37:17.831
Why did you kill
your attorney?

37:17.927 --> 37:20.231
- I didn't want him talking to you.
- About what?

37:20.327 --> 37:22.280
About anything.

37:29.577 --> 37:32.041
It's eating at you,
isn't it?

37:34.377 --> 37:39.242
What am I up to? Come on, Luis.
You have me in chains.

37:39.338 --> 37:42.090
Two tough guys waiting
for a chance to beat me to a pulp.

37:42.186 --> 37:44.170
Do it, Luis!

37:44.298 --> 37:46.186
See if you can
beat it out of me.

37:51.403 --> 37:53.707
You are no fun.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.454
Where are you going?

38:21.550 --> 38:23.470
Claudia?

38:24.591 --> 38:28.271
Claudia?
Claudia!

38:28.367 --> 38:30.991
What's wrong?

38:31.087 --> 38:33.776
My father
is the ranch foreman.

38:33.872 --> 38:37.200
You promised me he wouldn't
be involved in your other activities.

38:37.328 --> 38:40.336
I pay your father three times the going rate.
He can perform an extra task or two.

38:40.432 --> 38:43.153
No, no, no, no. I told you when
we came to live here...

38:43.249 --> 38:46.033
that I didn't want him
or my little brother...

38:46.129 --> 38:48.689
to be exposed
to your illegal business.

38:50.193 --> 38:52.498
You broke your word, Hector.

38:54.098 --> 38:56.306
And that hurts me.

38:58.514 --> 39:00.819
It hurts.

39:02.867 --> 39:04.915
I'm sorry, Claudia.

39:05.011 --> 39:08.211
- Please, I make it up to you.
- How?

39:08.307 --> 39:10.900
I-I give your father some time off.
An extra month pay.

39:12.404 --> 39:16.852
That's your solution
to every problem, isn't it? Money.

39:19.413 --> 39:21.525
Claudia.

39:21.621 --> 39:23.541
Claudia.

39:25.557 --> 39:27.318
Claudia!

39:38.231 --> 39:42.167
Yeah.

39:42.263 --> 39:44.279
Have you made the call
to the F.B.I?

39:44.375 --> 39:46.200
Yes, I did.

39:46.296 --> 39:48.184
And, uh,
what about our boy?

39:48.312 --> 39:50.136
I'm watching him now.

39:50.232 --> 39:52.824
- Keep him close.
- I will.

39:57.241 --> 40:02.489
So what was it like to get knee-deep
in some fine Tijuana tail?

40:02.618 --> 40:06.202
- Huh? I didn't do that.
- What do you mean?

40:06.298 --> 40:08.666
I mean, I didn't go
down there to get laid.

40:08.762 --> 40:12.315
- But you said...
- I know. I know. I know what I said.

40:14.267 --> 40:17.371
I just didn't wanna tell you
in case something happened.

40:20.700 --> 40:22.524
What's the big secret?

40:23.580 --> 40:25.948
Remember Zach Parker
from high school?

40:26.044 --> 40:28.860
Sure. But didn't he get busted
last year for dealing coke?

40:28.956 --> 40:32.445
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
He set me up with this guy down there.

40:32.541 --> 40:34.589
What do you mean he set you up?
How do you even know him?

40:34.685 --> 40:36.829
I know him, okay?

40:40.062 --> 40:42.494
What are you into here, man?
Are you selling dope?

40:42.622 --> 40:46.654
No. I'm not exactly
selling anything.

40:46.750 --> 40:48.575
Then exactly
what are you doing?

40:50.751 --> 40:52.863
This guy...

40:52.959 --> 40:55.231
he paid me five grand
to bring some coke over the border.

40:55.327 --> 40:59.584
I did that last night.
Today I drop it off, I get another five.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.984
- You gotta be outta your mind.
- It's just this one time.

41:02.080 --> 41:04.992
Getting over the border is the hard part.
That's already done.

41:05.120 --> 41:07.777
Why are you doing this?

41:07.873 --> 41:12.065
My mom's on dialysis.
My dad's out of a job.

41:12.161 --> 41:15.042
We're about to get evicted
from this crappy apartment.

41:15.170 --> 41:17.058
Is that good enough
for you?

41:17.154 --> 41:20.258
You are seriously insane.

41:20.354 --> 41:24.195
Tim, I'm about to make
this drop later today.

41:25.667 --> 41:27.587
I was just thinking maybe you and I,
we could go together.

41:27.715 --> 41:29.795
- No, forget it. No way.
- You just have to wait in the car.

41:29.891 --> 41:32.419
I go in. I make the drop.
I come back out. That's it.

41:32.515 --> 41:36.068
- It's no big deal.
- I'm not interested.

41:36.164 --> 41:39.780
Think about it.

41:41.348 --> 41:43.589
Whoo!

41:53.094 --> 41:56.742
Carry on.
When did the F.B.I. Get this call?

41:56.838 --> 41:58.662
About 20 minutes ago.

41:58.758 --> 42:01.351
And we don't know
who we're dealing with.

42:01.447 --> 42:03.975
It was a scrambled voice on an open line.
All we know is what he said.

42:04.071 --> 42:06.439
They want Salazar,
or they're gonna release the virus.

42:06.567 --> 42:08.840
What's your take
on this, Wayne?

42:08.936 --> 42:10.824
Do we cancel
the debate?

42:10.952 --> 42:13.832
Well, so far D.O.D.,
the Pentagon and C.T.U...

42:13.960 --> 42:16.072
haven't recommended
raising the alert level...

42:16.168 --> 42:19.401
but they are discussing whether
or not we should stay in Los Angeles.

42:20.457 --> 42:22.505
- Sir.
- Yes, Aaron.

42:22.601 --> 42:24.905
Dr. Packard's here.
She's asked to see you.

42:25.001 --> 42:28.042
- Tell her I'm busy, please.
- "Yes, Mr. President."

42:28.138 --> 42:30.474
Aaron, wait.

42:30.570 --> 42:33.194
- Tell her I'll speak with her.
- Yes, sir.

42:33.290 --> 42:35.114
Do you really wanna
do that right now?

42:35.210 --> 42:37.675
Yes, Wayne, I do.

42:55.981 --> 42:58.733
- Yes, Anne.
- I want you to start taking these.

42:58.829 --> 43:00.909
One in the morning
and one before you go to bed.

43:01.005 --> 43:02.894
It'll help your energy.

43:02.990 --> 43:05.006
I told you I was fine.

43:05.102 --> 43:06.926
I know what you told me.

43:07.022 --> 43:08.974
You gonna trust
your doctor or not?

43:11.118 --> 43:13.359
Of course I am.

43:15.407 --> 43:18.031
So, what's going on?
You seem upset.

43:19.087 --> 43:21.200
Nothing.

43:21.296 --> 43:23.760
It's just gonna be
another one of those days.

43:23.888 --> 43:26.512
What does that mean?

43:28.016 --> 43:30.353
I've got to get back.

43:30.449 --> 43:32.273
Okay.

43:33.425 --> 43:35.505
We'll talk later.

43:56.756 --> 43:58.580
What is wrong
with this system?

43:58.676 --> 44:01.556
- What?
- The grid won't come up.

44:03.316 --> 44:05.877
It's because you need to
Control-S out of it.

44:08.021 --> 44:09.909
You're still in navigation.

44:10.037 --> 44:11.893
Thank you.

44:18.102 --> 44:20.886
Look, can you just patch it
through to my office?

44:26.487 --> 44:29.527
What's his problem today?

44:29.623 --> 44:31.447
Nothing.

44:36.056 --> 44:38.616
This timeline doesn't make sense.
It goes straight from December to February.

44:38.712 --> 44:41.176
- What are you trying to do?
- Same thing you should be.

44:41.304 --> 44:44.601
- Solve this problem.
- That's not what I'm talking about.

44:47.385 --> 44:51.034
Listen, Jack. I'm gonna
be honest with you.

44:52.538 --> 44:54.362
I look up to you.

44:54.458 --> 44:56.282
I'd take a bullet
for you if I had to...

44:56.378 --> 44:58.938
but right now I'm gonna
hold the mirror up.

45:01.019 --> 45:04.379
You were under with Salazar
for six months.

45:04.507 --> 45:06.331
I know
what they did to you.

45:07.515 --> 45:09.884
And I know what
you did to yourself.

45:12.060 --> 45:15.324
You can't make that
go away overnight.

45:18.461 --> 45:20.637
You think I didn't know?

45:24.061 --> 45:27.198
You should mind
your own business, Chase.

45:29.758 --> 45:31.806
All I'm trying to say...

45:31.902 --> 45:33.726
is that
I'm here for you.

45:35.454 --> 45:39.999
But today is not the day to try to prove
to everybody that you're all better.

45:40.095 --> 45:43.615
It's about to hit the fan.
You know that and I know that.

45:48.960 --> 45:51.168
So, do what
you gotta do, man.

45:57.185 --> 46:01.473
Get your head straight
so we can do our work.

47:55.758 --> 47:58.030
Dad, you up there?

47:59.246 --> 48:02.639
- Dad?
- Yeah.

48:02.767 --> 48:05.391
Can I come up?
I need to talk to you about something.

48:05.487 --> 48:09.808
Uh, not right now, sweetheart.
I'm in the middle of something.

48:09.936 --> 48:13.104
Okay. Well, call me
when you have a few minutes.

48:13.200 --> 48:15.536
Okay.
