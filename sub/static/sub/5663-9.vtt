There's nobody down there.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.971
Not at the moment.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.390
So then...

40:06.571 --> 40:09.438
...why did you ask me to meet you
at an empty grave?

40:10.950 --> 40:12.565
There are...

40:13.578 --> 40:17.696
...foundational elements in our lives.

40:18.291 --> 40:19.872
People...

40:21.127 --> 40:24.290
...that form the brick and mortar
of who we are.

40:24.464 --> 40:29.800
People that are so deeply embedded
that we take their existence for granted...

40:29.969 --> 40:32.460
...until, suddenly, they're not there.

40:32.639 --> 40:34.345
And we...

40:35.308 --> 40:37.515
...collapse into rubble.

40:37.769 --> 40:41.853
I've stood over the open grave
of someone I've loved...

40:43.483 --> 40:45.439
...too often.

40:47.737 --> 40:53.232
Once for my mother,
and then the others.

40:54.744 --> 40:58.407
I needed to recall this feeling
because”.

41:01.501 --> 41:05.870
...I'd be staring at another body right now
if not for you, Aram.

41:06.047 --> 41:10.882
It wasn't weakness that prevented you
from watching your friend die today.

41:11.219 --> 41:16.304
It was hope, and thank heavens
you were in a hopeful mood.

41:16.766 --> 41:18.882
