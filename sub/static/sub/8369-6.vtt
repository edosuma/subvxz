31:41.033 --> 31:42.399
Then what is he?

31:42.401 --> 31:45.068
Oh, you'd need a science
background to understand it.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.037
I just want to
show you something.

31:47.039 --> 31:49.606
This is the hospital.

31:53.679 --> 31:56.246
You know, who I am,
where I fit in.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.749
But I feel like in this alley,
I fit right in, don't you?

31:58.751 --> 32:01.184
I can't give you a name.
Please.

32:01.186 --> 32:03.587
You see, this guy...

This is the morgue.

You got a pen?

32:21.106 --> 32:22.940

that I've done.

32:22.942 --> 32:26.109
Now, I know you saw
one of my mistakes.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.312
Right? There were others
before you, I admit it --

32:28.314 --> 32:29.613
Weaker women.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.448
See...

32:31.450 --> 32:33.951
I was looking for someone
strong, like you.

32:33.953 --> 32:36.420
Because no one
deserves to be alone,

32:36.422 --> 32:38.088
Even a monster like me.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.923
And you said
you'd be mine.

32:39.925 --> 32:41.725
You took my ring
over and over

32:41.727 --> 32:43.660
And said
that you'd share my life.

32:43.662 --> 32:47.431
So if I'm a monster
and you love me...

32:47.433 --> 32:49.566
You must be a monster,
too.

make you a beautiful monster.

have leathery skin.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.184
Some have scales.

33:07.186 --> 33:08.318
Some monsters --

33:08.320 --> 33:11.855
Well, some monsters
are covered in feathers.

33:11.857 --> 33:15.025
Black feathers.

33:16.027 --> 33:19.296
We'll tattoo the feathers, then
I think we'll implant the claws.

33:19.298 --> 33:22.566
Then we'll take that face of
yours off and give you another.
