00:36.754 --> 00:38.922
Okay, Fred.
Time for your colonoscopy.

00:38.924 --> 00:41.258
You may feel a little pressure
when I insert the camera.

00:41.260 --> 00:44.394
Yabba-dabba ...
Yaah! Yee!

00:44.396 --> 00:48.198
<i>- Now tell me what you see.
- Me going back to college.</i>

00:48.200 --> 00:50.133
Did you hear that?

00:50.135 --> 00:52.870
Get the stork out of my ass!

00:52.871 --> 00:57.941
A penis sucked is a penis earned...
So which one of you wants

00:57.943 --> 01:01.111
- to earn this dick?
- Okay, Mr. Franklin, hold that pose.

01:09.053 --> 01:12.222
Don't worry,Cinderella!
We'll get you to the ball yet.

01:12.224 --> 01:14.291
This is a spell
that works so well.

01:14.293 --> 01:17.361
Flippity floppity flee!
Hmm.

01:17.363 --> 01:19.847
Maybe I need to try a new spell.

01:19.848 --> 01:22.332
Oh, Satan, make me your whore

01:22.334 --> 01:26.970
- and send Cinderella to the ball!
- What the ... stop that!

01:26.972 --> 01:28.572
You want to go to the ball,
dear, right?

01:28.574 --> 01:31.708
- Well, yeah, but ...
- Well, my spell wasn't working,

01:31.710 --> 01:35.846
so I had to go with plan "B."
Oh, prince of suffering, free

01:35.848 --> 01:40.617
your minions from the darkest
crotch of hell and

01:40.619 --> 01:47.024
send Cinderella to the ball!

01:55.363 --> 01:57.901
Oh, and you also need shoes!

01:57.903 --> 02:02.072
No! Please!
Let it stop!

02:02.074 --> 02:04.675
Oh, silly me!
My wand was turned the wrong way.

02:04.677 --> 02:07.788
We didn't need the demons after all!

02:09.281 --> 02:11.365

<i>Scrooge McDuck is an

02:15.320 --> 02:18.367
<i>over 10 million swimming pools

02:18.368 --> 02:22.026
<i>Now entrepreneurs will fight for
his investment.</i>

02:23.027 --> 02:25.929
I'll give you two bathtubs of rubies

02:25.931 --> 02:28.732
- for 25% of the company.
- I'm sorry.

02:28.734 --> 02:31.001
- How much money is that?
- Guess what, smartass.

02:31.003 --> 02:33.403
My offer is now one gold rock
the size of a goose egg.

02:33.405 --> 02:35.939
- Is that more or less?
- I'll go in with a toilet

02:35.941 --> 02:38.208
- full of emeralds.
- Get off me balls, Cuban!

02:40.478 --> 02:44.781
Take a good look at what they
did to your father, children.

02:44.783 --> 02:49.052
Look long and hard

<i>Jason! Dinner!</i>

In a second, mom!
I'm playing "Rollercoaster Tycoon!"

02:58.998 --> 03:01.856
[bleep] idiots.

03:01.967 --> 03:05.569
We are shocked that such a
terrible crash could occur here

03:05.571 --> 03:09.373
at "no gaywads allowed" land.
Our park owner is unavailable

03:09.375 --> 03:11.951
for questions, as he is
currently studying for,

03:12.050 --> 03:14.678
and I quote,
"some lameballs math quiz."

03:14.680 --> 03:17.447
Yes, how do you respond to
accusations that the park owner

03:17.449 --> 03:19.483
has been drowning tourists in the lake?

03:19.485 --> 03:21.618
- No comment.
- I would just like to point

03:21.620 --> 03:23.654
out that these hot dogs
are very good value.

03:23.656 --> 03:27.959
We are very proud of the food sold
at "haha hot dogs look like dicks."

03:27.960 --> 03:30.727
What the ...

03:32.242 --> 03:33.764
Jiro, I am in great debt to you

03:33.766 --> 03:36.099
for helping me train for the
Fruit Ninja tournament.

03:36.101 --> 03:39.670
The honor is all mine, brother.

03:43.274 --> 03:44.486
Aah! Jiro!

03:44.487 --> 03:46.910
Was that a [bleep] bomb, Jiro?!

03:46.912 --> 03:49.680
I'm so sorry, brother.
Sometimes I confuse my fruit

03:49.682 --> 03:51.948
- basket with my bomb basket.
- Your bomb basket?!

03:51.950 --> 03:52.605
Look, I'm sorry.

03:52.606 --> 03:56.700
Let's just stay
focused on the training.

03:59.087 --> 04:02.326
Jiro! Three lit bombs?!

04:02.327 --> 04:05.896
- What the [bleep] is going on, Jiro?!
- Okay, okay.

04:05.898 --> 04:08.899
Just don't tell mom.
I'm kind of a wanted

04:08.901 --> 04:10.233
- Japanese terrorist.
- What?!

04:10.235 --> 04:13.036
- You're a what?!
- Hey, if my bombs are here,

04:13.038 --> 04:16.289
- where's that extra fruit?
- Everyone dies!

04:16.401 --> 04:19.454
Ah, damn it, Jiro!

04:21.379 --> 04:24.314
Ha ha!
That's a good-looking pie!

04:24.316 --> 04:25.810
Yah-tah-tah-tah!

04:26.101 --> 04:32.055
You know, maybe that Jason
Biggs had a good idea or two.

04:32.057 --> 04:34.825
<i>Ohh! That's hot!
That's so hot!</i>

04:34.827 --> 04:37.761
What's that darn ol'
Purple Pie Man up to now?

04:37.763 --> 04:41.631
<i>Oh, Huckleberry pie!
Yes! I'm so deep in you!</i>

04:41.633 --> 04:44.534
- Oh!
- Huckleberry pie, you are

04:44.536 --> 04:48.305
accused of fraternizing with our
enemy, the Purple Pie Man.

04:48.307 --> 04:50.741
- Aw, that's bullcrap!
- I know what I heard!

04:50.743 --> 04:54.444
Whatever! Just sentence me so
I can get back to my fishing.

04:56.347 --> 04:58.415
It's getting a little
"Children of the corn" down there.

04:58.417 --> 05:01.187
Eh.

05:02.354 --> 05:03.098
Ugh!

05:03.099 --> 05:06.402
Oh, right.
I [bleep] this one.

05:06.403 --> 05:07.308
Meh.

05:09.327 --> 05:11.194
Okay, Marilyn, time for your big scene.

05:11.196 --> 05:13.630
- Just one more taco.
- We're losing the light.

05:13.632 --> 05:16.500
- But these tacos are great.
- No more tacos!

05:16.502 --> 05:18.569
<i>Places, everyone! Places!</i>

05:18.570 --> 05:22.806
- "Seven year itch," scene 78, take 1.
- And action!

05:25.860 --> 05:26.877
Oops.

05:26.879 --> 05:29.179
Cut!
What the [bleep] was that?

05:29.181 --> 05:30.981
- Tacos.
- Do we have time for another take?

05:30.983 --> 05:32.616
Oh, we just lost the light.

05:32.618 --> 05:34.651
[bleep] it.
We'll say it was a passing train

05:34.653 --> 05:36.653
or something.
Let's move on to the next scene.

05:36.655 --> 05:39.884
Guys, I definitely shit myself.

05:47.219 --> 05:50.808
Oh, no! Doc! 
Someone call 911!

05:51.009 --> 05:53.371
Hey, what's up everybody.
I'm Little Mac.

05:53.372 --> 05:56.076
For 25 years, doc had two passions ...

05:56.111 --> 05:58.542
training me to punch
out my opponents and

05:58.544 --> 06:01.444
eating fried butter.
I'm heartened to see so many

06:01.446 --> 06:04.581
- of my former opponents here today.
- Life is so fragile.

06:04.583 --> 06:08.185
I, Great Tiger, was diagnosed
with brain cancer last week.

06:08.187 --> 06:11.254
Turns out this teleportation gem
was pumping radiation

06:11.256 --> 06:13.323
into my brain, and it ...
Oh, no. No!

06:13.325 --> 06:15.525
I can't take it anymore!
I can't control it!

06:15.527 --> 06:17.528
Where is it taking me now?

06:17.529 --> 06:19.465
Please!
Not Detroit again!

06:19.531 --> 06:23.133
I am Soda Popinski.
Doc suffered from type 2 diabetes,

06:23.135 --> 06:26.803
just like me.
And let me tell you, I learned

06:26.805 --> 06:31.082
nothing from this! I'd rather
die than drink sugar-free soda!

06:31.083 --> 06:37.921
Diet Dr. Pepper does not taste
like regular Dr. Pepper!

06:39.318 --> 06:43.053
Doc was the one who said,
"King Hippo, get your stomach stapled."

06:43.055 --> 06:46.501
But he never warned me about
leftover skin!

06:46.502 --> 06:48.191
My stomach is basically a skirt!

06:48.193 --> 06:50.560
Whoa!

06:50.562 --> 06:53.430
I did not know doc.
I have filled my pockets with

06:53.432 --> 06:55.966
all the pizza rolls.
Now I am leaving.

06:55.968 --> 06:59.269
If you think you can stop me,
you are welcome to try.

07:02.787 --> 07:07.591
The spell is broken!
This was my true form all along.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.893
I can't wait to marry you, Shrek!

07:09.895 --> 07:11.628
- Marry you?
- Well, yeah.

07:11.630 --> 07:14.765
Since we look the same now,
we'll live happily ever after.

07:14.767 --> 07:18.802
Fiona, every morning, I look
at myself in the mirror and I wish

07:18.804 --> 07:22.706
my mother had the courage
to throw me in the river

07:22.708 --> 07:26.511
when I was born. Then I make
my way to the putrid swamps, the

07:26.512 --> 07:30.314
only place on god's green earth
a monster like me feels at home.

07:30.315 --> 07:33.451
Sometimes children
gather to scream at me.

07:33.452 --> 07:35.719
"Monster! Animal!" they yell.

07:35.721 --> 07:39.723
Then someone screams, "kill yourself!"
And it takes a few

07:39.725 --> 07:44.094
seconds to realize the voice is
coming from my own mouth.

07:44.096 --> 07:47.431
By then, I've made my way
to the old hangin' tree.

07:47.433 --> 07:50.267
Before I have time to think
about it, I'm wrapping a vine

07:50.269 --> 07:53.370
around my own neck.
It goes taut, and I pray

07:53.372 --> 07:56.573
to the gods that, this time,
the vine will hold.

07:56.575 --> 08:00.610
But, alas, every day,
I wake up in my own filth.

08:00.612 --> 08:02.763
And I lie there, and I cry.

08:02.764 --> 08:08.385
I cry because I'll live to
see my face again! So, no.

08:08.387 --> 08:11.702
Marrying a lass with a face as
hideous as my own

08:11.768 --> 08:15.659
- is not on my to-do list!
- Have you tried these

08:15.661 --> 08:19.129
mini cheeseburgers?
Great!

08:24.870 --> 08:26.937
- A vampire!
- Oh, that sailor's a [bleep] vampire!

08:41.719 --> 08:43.986
Where is it when I really need it?

08:43.989 --> 08:47.438
- Ugh!
- Hey, She-Ra, I made a balloon!

08:49.928 --> 08:52.729
Ah, birth control is magic.
And I don't just mean I don't

08:52.731 --> 08:55.365
understand how it works.
I mean, on my world it's

08:55.367 --> 08:58.969
- literally created by sorcerers.
- When you're on the tour bus,

08:58.971 --> 09:00.704
birth control is whatever's handy.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.273
You improvise.
A hardee's cheeseburger wrapper

09:03.275 --> 09:07.277
tied off with a hair scrunchie,
or, you know, just do anal.

09:07.279 --> 09:11.248
Are any kids gonna see this?
I do not like that answer.

09:11.250 --> 09:14.384
You want to see something really unsexy?

09:14.386 --> 09:17.554
These are from the PX
at Cobra headquarters.

09:17.556 --> 09:21.124
No, no, no. Wait.
It gets better.

09:22.919 --> 09:25.043
__

09:26.211 --> 09:28.058
_

09:28.784 --> 09:31.001
__

09:31.002 --> 09:33.403
Ugh!
In a village where the

09:33.405 --> 09:38.108
male-to-female ratio is 99 to 1,
every other text message

09:38.110 --> 09:41.745
- is a dick pic.
- Do boys ask for photos of my berries?

09:41.747 --> 09:46.550
Why, yes!
Everyone knows I have very good berries.

09:46.552 --> 09:49.886
Yes, like I said, my berries.
Berries.

09:49.888 --> 09:54.324
- Are you asking about my tits?!
- Pussy double entendre.

09:54.326 --> 09:57.894
Pussy double entendre.
Oh, here's a good one ...

09:57.896 --> 09:59.796
pussy double entendre.

10:01.799 --> 10:03.322
Oooh, la la!

10:03.323 --> 10:06.369
Got to love the bad boys.

10:06.371 --> 10:08.371
I hooked up with Moss Man once.

10:08.373 --> 10:10.607
Afterward, my bed smelled like
a hefty bag full of lawn

10:10.609 --> 10:13.376
trimmings that's been sitting in
the sun for two days.

10:13.378 --> 10:15.912
Also, his penis was a gnarled root.

10:16.014 --> 10:18.215
Here's a joke.
This is a good one.

10:18.217 --> 10:21.685
"What's the difference between
a face and a toilet?"

10:21.687 --> 10:24.456
You know who else doesn't know
the answer?  R. Kelly.

10:24.491 --> 10:28.342
I gave a blowjob to Osama bin Laden.

10:28.459 --> 10:32.295
Ha!
The look on your face!

10:32.297 --> 10:36.361
I did, though.
Terrorcon '94.
