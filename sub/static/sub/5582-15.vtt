WEBVTT

00:18.386 --> 00:19.820
Hey, knock it off.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.255
I'm so sorry.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.423
You okay?

00:22.456 --> 00:24.558
Yeah.
I thought it'd be fun

00:24.592 --> 00:25.726
to take her for a train ride.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.128
Forgot that most of it
was overnight.

00:29.263 --> 00:31.099
Staying up all
night sucks, huh?

00:32.233 --> 00:34.202
On the other hand,

00:34.235 --> 00:36.304
bragging to your friends
about it...

00:36.337 --> 00:37.571
pretty awesome.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.145
Pretty gnarly, huh?

00:44.178 --> 00:45.546
What happened?

00:45.579 --> 00:47.548
MAN: That's enough!
Just shut up!

00:47.581 --> 00:48.849
WOMAN:
Hey, just calm down.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.251
MAN: I don't want
to hear anymore!

00:50.284 --> 00:52.186
I don't even know you.
You don't understand.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.588
Shut up!

00:54.622 --> 00:56.524
MAN: J-Just shut up!
Stay down.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.292
Shut up!
Nobody move, okay?

00:58.326 --> 01:00.794
OFFICER: Stay down.
It'll be okay.
What are you doing?

01:00.828 --> 01:03.264
Stop moving!
I'm gonna go talk to him.

01:03.297 --> 01:07.201
You keep an eye on my daughter?
MAN: Everybody, just stay calm.

01:07.235 --> 01:09.470
MAN: If you move...
It'll be easier
with two of us.

01:09.503 --> 01:12.240
Stop! Don't move!
Whatever happens,
you stay down, okay?

01:12.273 --> 01:13.607
MAN: You hear what I said?

01:13.641 --> 01:14.875
No moving!

01:14.908 --> 01:16.477
Stop crying!
Shut up!

01:16.510 --> 01:18.379
Just shut up!

01:18.412 --> 01:19.213
Just shut up!
Hey, man.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.281
Hey, hey...

01:20.314 --> 01:22.350
Calm down.

01:22.383 --> 01:23.251
What the hell, man?
I told you not to move.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.852
I just, I just want
to help you, man.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.220
What happened?

01:26.254 --> 01:28.356
She was rude to me.

01:28.389 --> 01:29.523
Uh-huh.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.225
She wouldn't listen.

01:31.259 --> 01:34.628
Why the hell wouldn't
she just listen?

01:34.662 --> 01:35.863
Hey, everything's
gonna be okay, man.

01:35.896 --> 01:37.365
I promise.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.733
Just give me the gun.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.235
Just give me the gun.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.337
Okay.

01:55.383 --> 01:58.586
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay... Stay with me.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.720
I'm putting more pressure on,
all right? It's gonna hurt.

01:59.753 --> 02:00.821
What's your daughter's name?

02:00.854 --> 02:02.423
Sadie, Sadie.
I'm gonna... Sadie?

02:02.456 --> 02:03.657
Okay.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.326
Sadie, it's okay.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.327
Just stay right there.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.928
Okay, come on, come on.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.263
Come on.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.264
Stay with me, Lieutenant!

02:10.298 --> 02:12.833
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:12.866 --> 02:15.503
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:15.536 --> 02:17.938
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:17.971 --> 02:18.906
* How, how, how, how

02:18.939 --> 02:22.343
* Hey, hey

02:27.381 --> 02:30.251
* You gotta come on.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.321
Morning.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.922
I come bearing gifts.

02:34.955 --> 02:37.858
New coffee shop finally
opened up, and I got all fancy.

02:37.891 --> 02:38.959
Brought us lattes.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.361
They're supposed
to be amazing.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.368
That is amazing.
Right?

02:47.401 --> 02:50.971
Yeah, it's got,
like a, hang on...

02:51.004 --> 02:53.707
It's got like a special taste
or something, what...

02:53.741 --> 02:55.743
Oh, shoot, you got Sonja's.
It's soy.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.378
Uh-huh.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.912
Here.
No, no, no.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.814
I don't want another one.
I'll make my own.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.716
Well, make one for Sonja,
because these all have milk.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.918
No, Sonja's not here.
She's traveling.

03:04.952 --> 03:05.853
She said she was done
with FLETC.

03:05.886 --> 03:06.854
Not FLETC.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.989
Personal.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.824
LASALLE:
Hey, y'all, get in here.

03:10.858 --> 03:11.825
You seen the news?

03:11.859 --> 03:13.661
Train shooting.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.596
NEWSWOMAN: At this point,
Details are sketchy.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.231
emergency personnel
have arrived on the scene.
Thank you.

03:17.265 --> 03:19.500
of the Louisiana Cypress
shooting.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.469
We can confirm the gunman
fired multiple shots,

03:21.502 --> 03:23.637
but the number of injuries
is unknown.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.939
Police are working on the
identity of the shooter.

03:25.973 --> 03:29.009
The motive behind the attack
is unclear as of now,

03:29.042 --> 03:30.878
but with the investigation
still unfolding,
Two casualties confirmed.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.946
witnesses' statements
are being obtained...
Injured sailor onboard.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.515
NOPD wants our assistance.
Let's work.

03:37.618 --> 03:38.786
PRIDE:
Loretta.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.020
Tell me what we know.

03:40.053 --> 03:40.988
WADE:
Two fatalities.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.823
First, Brian Hendrich, he's 22.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.325
He's our gunman.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.260
Shot a young woman
at close range.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.696
Our girl was Morgan Oliver,
25 years old,

03:48.729 --> 03:51.432
grad student at Tulane,
traveling with her best friend.

03:51.465 --> 03:54.435
Hendrich also shot Lieutenant
Commander Mark Jacoby.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.003
He's in surgery
at St. Teresa's.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.438
According to witnesses,

03:57.471 --> 03:59.440
Jacoby was trying to talk
Hendrich down.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.974
Almost had the gun

04:01.008 --> 04:03.677
when Hendrich "went crazy"
and started firing.

04:03.711 --> 04:04.912
Now, everyone has their
own version of the story,

04:04.945 --> 04:06.680
but they all use the word crazy.

04:06.714 --> 04:07.881
Yeah, another similarity

04:07.915 --> 04:09.450
is everyone says two men

04:09.483 --> 04:10.984
tried to stop the shooter.

04:11.018 --> 04:13.721
Jacoby went in for the gun;
the other man stabbed him.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.556
Connected with him
under the armpit.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.458
Whoever he is,
he knows what he's doing.

04:17.491 --> 04:20.060
It's only one cut, precise.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.962
Completely cleaved
the vessel.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.797
Yeah, well, the knife
and the could-be hero

04:23.831 --> 04:25.032
is gone with the wind.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.600
We got to find him.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.536
He and Commander Jacoby
were closest to our perp.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.371
Their information will be
the most reliable.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.639
BRODY:
Well, if our second hero

04:31.672 --> 04:32.706
were injured,
he would have been

04:32.740 --> 04:33.907
taken in by the paramedics.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.042
A lot of people were hurt
in the chaos.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.310
I'll check it out.

04:36.344 --> 04:37.711
Thanks, Loretta.
Sure.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.813
I'll liaise with NOPD.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.048
Chris, go to St. Teresa's.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.450
Check on our commander
and his daughter.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.485
LASALLE: You got it.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.086
JACOBY:
So, no one else was killed?

04:46.119 --> 04:48.422
Just the woman?

04:48.456 --> 04:49.823
Thank God.

04:49.857 --> 04:52.393
Commander, the gunman,
Brian Hendrich--

04:52.426 --> 04:53.727
had you ever seen him before?

04:53.761 --> 04:54.895
Earlier on the train?

04:54.928 --> 04:56.397
I don't think so.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.565
I-I barely even
remember his face.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.066
Everything
happened so fast.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.401
He was ranting
about the woman.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.802
Said she was rude.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.805
Thought I was getting
through to him.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.073
If that other guy
hadn't helped...

05:07.140 --> 05:08.642
This other guy...

05:08.676 --> 05:09.677
tell me about him.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.878
Never seen him before, either.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.046
He was just sitting by us.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.848
Well, we haven't been
able to find him.

05:14.882 --> 05:17.918
Uh, he was... in his 20's.

05:17.951 --> 05:20.053
But, uh, he seemed older.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.489
He was good with Sadie.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.491
He had a bad scar on his neck.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.359
All the way up to his ear.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.595
He put his hand in the
bullet hole in my Dad's neck,

05:27.628 --> 05:29.062
kept it there till
the ambulance came.

05:29.096 --> 05:32.032
Are these the clothes
you were wearing today?

05:32.065 --> 05:34.435
: Yeah.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.736
You mind if I take them?

05:35.769 --> 05:37.505
Might be help us I.D.
our mystery man.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.506
Whatever you need.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.674
The guy's a hero.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.710
And if you find him,
I'd like to thank him.

05:42.743 --> 05:43.911
Me, too.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.379
He saved my dad's life.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.950
Thank you, guys.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.785
BRODY:
I talked to all

05:51.819 --> 05:53.086
the hospitals accepting victims,

05:53.120 --> 05:54.988
and, so far, no one
matching the description

05:55.022 --> 05:56.424
of our mystery man
has been admitted.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.592
So he just disappeared.

05:58.626 --> 06:01.128
I mean, why intervene
and then run off?

06:01.161 --> 06:02.663
Camera shy?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.665
Ran a check on the gun
Hendrich used.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.934
First purchase, legal sale.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.036
The gun store owner had
to give him a tutorial.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.704
This guy had never handled
a firearm before.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.172
Small blessing.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.141
I guess.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.944
So,  you talk
to Sonja lately?

06:16.977 --> 06:18.045
It's been a couple days.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.648
Pride says she's traveling.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.015
Personal matter.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.451
Well, King says it...

06:23.484 --> 06:24.718
Ah, it's more what
he didn't say.

06:25.753 --> 06:26.987
You're her work husband.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.557
Come on, what do you know?

06:29.590 --> 06:30.958
"Work husband?"

06:30.991 --> 06:32.793
Now what in the Sam Hill
does that mean?

06:32.826 --> 06:33.794
It's a thing.

06:33.827 --> 06:34.995
Everyone knows it.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.129
And you're Sonja's.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.465
Now...

06:37.498 --> 06:38.699
look...
Saved by the bell.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.202
Autopsy results are in.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.572
Morgan Oliver was shot once,
close range,

06:44.605 --> 06:46.139
to the upper abdomen.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.642
The bullet nicked her
right ventricle,

06:48.676 --> 06:51.011
causing almost
instantaneous death.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.880
Commander Jacoby said
Hendrich was ranting

06:52.913 --> 06:54.648
about Morgan
before he shot her.

06:54.682 --> 06:58.085
Hendrich was not the only one
intent to kill.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.120
The man who stabbed him
knew severing

07:00.153 --> 07:02.089
the axillary artery

07:02.122 --> 07:04.091
would cause exsanguination.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.759
He bled out.

07:05.793 --> 07:08.095
Sounds like our mystery man's
got some training.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.663
Like an assassin.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.131
Or medical expertise.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.733
He saved Jacoby's life

07:12.766 --> 07:15.503
by applying pressure to his
wound in a specific way.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.770
Anything else?

07:16.804 --> 07:19.106
Hendrich had clozapine
in his system.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.674
It's an antipsychotic.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.810
Stays in the body
up to a week.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.244
Levels were low,

07:24.277 --> 07:26.747
so it suggests he had stopped
taking it recently.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.115
That adds up.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.150
NOPD found a full bottle
in his apartment.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.252
Any indication
Hendrich knew Morgan?

07:32.285 --> 07:34.021
Not according
to Morgan's friend.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.523
They met in the dining car,

07:35.556 --> 07:37.591
he followed them back
to their seats.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.593
Apparently, she said something
that set him off.

07:39.627 --> 07:42.763
All the hallmarks of a
mentally disturbed lone gunman.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.765
One in a long line lately.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.266
Too long.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.268
So, case closed?

07:48.301 --> 07:49.537
Uh, not so fast.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.138
I, uh, I found something
interesting.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.372
Floor's yours.

07:52.405 --> 07:53.607
All right, so I started running
prints from the crime scene.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.644
They were everywhere, which
makes sense on a public train.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.278
Lots of people,
lots of touching.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.780
That... sounds bad.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.615
Anyway, uh, it would
take weeks to sort out

08:01.649 --> 08:03.116
which prints go with whom,

08:03.150 --> 08:04.251
but then Lasalle
brought me this.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.619
Commander Jacoby's shirt.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.287
Covered in Jacoby's blood,

08:07.320 --> 08:08.889
which at first seemed
less than useful,

08:08.922 --> 08:10.691
since we already had
an I.D. on him.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.259
But then, I noticed this:

08:15.596 --> 08:17.865
Fingerprint in the blood.
Exactly.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.967
Now, only one person
touched Jacoby's shirt.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.234
Three, if you count
the paramedics,

08:21.268 --> 08:22.736
but I ruled them out,

08:22.770 --> 08:24.872
which leaves the man who saved
Jacoby's life.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.274
Now, it was a-a partial print,
smeared,

08:27.307 --> 08:29.577
so it took a little doing,
but hey, I'm me.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.278
I handled it.

08:31.311 --> 08:34.214
So, meet our second hero,
Nolan Griffith.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.617
Trained under the Marine Corps
Martial Arts Program.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.886
Which explains
his knife-fighting skills.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.621
Yeah, he served two tours
in Afghanistan

08:40.654 --> 08:41.722
as a hospital corpsman.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.190
We got a current address?

08:43.223 --> 08:44.758
That's where things get
a little squirrely.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.259
See, Corpsman Griffith

08:46.293 --> 08:47.728
was captured by the enemy
overseas in 2012.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.129
He was never found.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.301
So, how the hell did he wind up
on a train in New Orleans?

09:04.177 --> 09:05.813
It was a routine mission,

09:05.846 --> 09:08.248
routine being a relative term
in Khyber Pass.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.917
I was hit by an IED.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.118
Torn up.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.920
Insurgents started pouring in.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.755
NEWSWOMAN: You ordered your men
to leave you,

09:14.788 --> 09:16.824
and Nolan Griffith ignored you?

09:16.857 --> 09:20.093
Administered tactical
combat casualty care.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.662
That's when they grabbed him.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.264
That was 2012.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.800
Militants captured Nolan,
and left Manning to die.

09:26.834 --> 09:29.670
But thanks to Nolan's
medical care, he survived.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.038
Corpsman Nolan Griffith

09:31.071 --> 09:33.106
was awarded the Bronze Star
in absentia.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.743
BRODY:
Meanwhile, his captors

09:35.776 --> 09:37.945
leaked videos of him
being tortured.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.747
This was released

09:39.780 --> 09:42.215
in October, 2014.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.618
Aman Bashir.
Pakistani militant,

09:44.652 --> 09:46.253
unhappy with his country's

09:46.286 --> 09:48.822
military and economic
ties to the U.S.

09:48.856 --> 09:50.257
Responsible for attacks

09:50.290 --> 09:52.926
in Middle East, Europe,
and Asia.

09:52.960 --> 09:56.163
That image of Nolan is almost
a year and a half old.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.698
What've we got on him since?

09:57.731 --> 09:59.767
Nothing.
No sign of him being alive,

09:59.800 --> 10:01.735
and the Navy's compartmented
his files.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.172
LASALLE: No scar.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.640
Jacoby's daughter

10:06.674 --> 10:09.677
said Nolan had a nasty scar
on his neck.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.543
I don't see it here.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.946
Nothing about it
in his military records.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.848
Something happened to Nolan

10:14.882 --> 10:18.151
between that video's recording
and yesterday.

10:18.185 --> 10:21.254
Besides a scar.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.023
Why is he hiding?

10:24.057 --> 10:26.093
I'm gonna talk
to Navy Intel,

10:26.126 --> 10:28.862
find out what they
aren't telling us.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.430
Nolan must be
using an alias.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.000
Dig into the train manifest,
find it.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.034
On it, King.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.135
Nolan's sister lives in...

10:35.168 --> 10:37.137
Mississippi.
All right.

10:37.170 --> 10:41.675
See if she knows why
her brother wound up here.

10:41.709 --> 10:44.044
Been dozens of sightings
of Nolan over the years.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.312
None panned out.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.114
We found his fingerprints.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.818
Witnesses say he saved a lot of
lives on that train yesterday.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.186
That's my brother.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.055
Trouble finds him

10:55.088 --> 10:57.157
and he always saves the day.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.995
You really
think he's alive?

11:02.029 --> 11:03.230
We do.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.966
I didn't believe in miracles...

11:09.169 --> 11:10.237
What?

11:10.270 --> 11:11.739
What aren't
you telling me?

11:11.772 --> 11:13.040
Since Nolan's been back,

11:13.073 --> 11:16.143
he hasn't contacted you,
or anyone...

11:16.176 --> 11:19.112
Maybe he's forgotten things.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.448
Losing our parents
nearly broke him.

11:21.481 --> 11:25.285
And then
he was taken, tortured.

11:25.318 --> 11:28.121
He's been to hell and back.

11:28.155 --> 11:31.458
I can't believe
he's alive.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.927
LASALLE:
This guy we're meeting--

11:33.961 --> 11:35.162
he's Navy Intel?

11:35.195 --> 11:36.329
Not Navy.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.031
Civilian.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.433
PRIDE:
DoD referred us to him.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.969
LASALLE:
So...

11:42.002 --> 11:43.470
CIA.

11:43.503 --> 11:47.407
MAN:
Orangutans are my favorite apes.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.943
They're cunning.

11:49.977 --> 11:53.981
They often observe
their caregivers.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.485
Learn their routines,
then they use that knowledge

11:58.518 --> 12:00.921
to try to escape.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.957
We got questions
about Nolan Griffith.

12:03.991 --> 12:06.059
Heard you got answers.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.028
It's possible.

12:08.061 --> 12:11.531
And why are you asking?

12:11.564 --> 12:15.335
'Cause he showed up
in New Orleans yesterday.

12:15.368 --> 12:21.008
Which, given his history,
seems odd, to say the least.

12:25.245 --> 12:29.282
Since you are so chatty,
maybe you can tell us

12:29.316 --> 12:32.219
why a CIA agent is running
point on a missing sailor.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.090
You think I ask to meet at the
local zoo, I must be a spy?

12:37.124 --> 12:38.826
We think you're a spy

12:38.859 --> 12:40.427
'cause you got Agency
written all over you.

12:40.460 --> 12:44.264
You agreed to meet us.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.236
There's a great deal
of public pressure

12:49.269 --> 12:50.904
to find Corpsman Griffith.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.173
We had men embedded
in the Khyber Pass.

12:53.206 --> 12:56.476
Started poking around
for intel on his whereabouts.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.146
His sister thought you came
close to finding him.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.915
Actionable intelligence led
to a specific point

13:01.949 --> 13:03.083
within the Spin Ghar.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.217
We went in.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.853
Things went sideways.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.021
Never laid eyes on Nolan.

13:08.055 --> 13:12.225
I thought he was long dead,
till you guys called.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.995
You don't seem too excited
to find out he's alive.

13:15.028 --> 13:17.164
First off,
don't know that he is.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.066
Oh, we got fingerprints.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.333
Eyewitness I.D.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.870
Neither of which are foolproof.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.337
Could be a scam.

13:24.371 --> 13:28.241
Pretty confident in our
intel, and so are you,

13:28.275 --> 13:29.943
or you wouldn't have come
all the way to New Orleans

13:29.977 --> 13:31.311
just to look at apes.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.480
Well, let's say you're right.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.316
It could be another
Bowe Bergdahl type situation.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.887
Not great for anyone.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.221
If you'll excuse me,

13:41.254 --> 13:43.356
it's feeding time
for the gorillas.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.096
Meet Mathias Dressler.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.430
He took the train from NOLA

13:50.463 --> 13:52.232
all the way to its final stop
in Chicago,

13:52.265 --> 13:53.967
then back again.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.235
But I couldn't get a clear look

13:55.268 --> 13:57.304
at his scars on any photos,

13:57.337 --> 13:58.838
but this is how Sadie Jacoby
remembers it.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.508
Mathias, AKA Nolan Griffith.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.277
He's traveling
under a German passport.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.246
He entered the U.S.
about two months ago

14:06.279 --> 14:08.115
at the border crossing
of Nuevo Laredo.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.649
So he wouldn't have been
flagged, 'cause if you're not

14:09.682 --> 14:11.651
a Mexican or American,
no one pays much attention.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.322
Okay, so, somehow he got
from Afghanistan to Texas?

14:15.355 --> 14:18.025
And from there on to the
great state of Louisiana.

14:18.058 --> 14:21.028
He's been in New Orleans
about three weeks, which is when

14:21.061 --> 14:23.063
he signed this
lease agreement-- mm!

14:23.096 --> 14:24.197
French Quarter.

14:24.231 --> 14:25.298
All right, I'll call
Pride and Lasalle.

14:25.332 --> 14:26.366
Thank you, Patton.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.168
You got it.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.287
BRODY:
Clear.

14:49.656 --> 14:50.890
LASALLE:
All clear.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.428
Hey, check this out.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.300
Got some sort of...

15:00.333 --> 15:02.402
powder residue on his shoes.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.071
We'll get a sample to Sebastian.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.138
And it's everywhere.

15:06.173 --> 15:08.308
Trail ends at the chair.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.346
Look at this.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.598
Better get that to him, also.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.340
PRIDE: He's running!

15:40.373 --> 15:41.374
BRODY:
I'll call NOPD.

15:59.426 --> 16:03.130
LASALLE:
NCIS! Hey!

16:03.163 --> 16:04.531
*

16:08.501 --> 16:09.569
PRIDE:
Out of the way!

16:12.639 --> 16:14.741
TOUR GUIDE: A little-known fact
about Jean Lafitte...

16:14.774 --> 16:17.044
Hey! You can't be in here!

16:17.077 --> 16:18.078
What are you...?

16:20.247 --> 16:21.514
So sorry about this, folks.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.682
LASALLE: Where'd he go?

16:22.715 --> 16:24.251
Which way'd he go?
Through there!

16:24.284 --> 16:25.385
He almost knocked
me over, that jerk!

16:25.418 --> 16:26.519
I hope you get him!

16:35.495 --> 16:37.397
I just saw him.

16:37.430 --> 16:38.565
I saw his face.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.300
It's him. He's here.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.334
Who's here?

16:41.368 --> 16:44.404
Aman Bashir is in our city.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.751
Landlord said
Nolan was a model tenant.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.687
Quiet, kept to himself.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.155
Ever see Bashir with him?

17:02.189 --> 17:03.190
He saw someone.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.791
Tall, olive skin.

17:04.824 --> 17:07.794
Kept his face obscured.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.229
Nolan and Bashir
both managed

17:09.262 --> 17:11.564
to avoid every camera
in the vicinity.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.766
Talked to U.S. Customs
and Border Protection.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.236
No record of Bashir entering
or he would've been stopped,

17:16.269 --> 17:17.704
but they did find this.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.806
Nolan Griffith at the
border in Laredo.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.508
Ran plates, got a hit.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.410
Texas Rangers found
it abandoned.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.477
False bottom.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.713
Big enough to hold a man.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.781
So, Nolan crossed into the U.S.
with Bashir hidden in his car.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.750
Headed for New Orleans,
switched vehicles.

17:30.783 --> 17:31.751
Rented an apartment...

17:31.784 --> 17:34.521
All signs point to
Bashir planning an attack

17:34.554 --> 17:35.855
in New Orleans, with Nolan.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.724
Corpsman was Bashir's captive.

17:37.757 --> 17:38.858
He was tortured,
nearly killed...

17:38.891 --> 17:40.793
Probably fed all kinds
of lies, too.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.329
I mean, you get angry enough,

17:42.362 --> 17:43.796
feel abandoned
by your country...

17:43.830 --> 17:46.333
So, you come all this way
to carry out this attack,

17:46.366 --> 17:49.636
and then stop to save a bunch
of innocent people's lives?

17:49.669 --> 17:51.671
What the hell were you doing,
tangling with Aman Bashir?

17:51.704 --> 17:53.406
You blew six months...!
PRIDE: Whoa!

17:53.440 --> 17:54.474
Whoa, whoa! Wait a minute.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.143
of CIA surveillance!
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

17:56.176 --> 17:57.644
If you told us
why you were here,

17:57.677 --> 17:59.112
we would have handled
it differently.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.413
I don't owe you
any explanations...

18:00.447 --> 18:01.648
The hell you don't.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.117
CIA has no jurisdiction
within the U.S.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.119
I don't give a crap
about jurisdiction.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.755
We're at war, trying to catch
some very bad guys.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.823
So are we.
Now, you want to revise

18:10.857 --> 18:12.125
your earlier answers?

18:12.159 --> 18:13.793
Because if you were
spying on Bashir,

18:13.826 --> 18:15.428
then you must have known

18:15.462 --> 18:16.796
that Nolan smuggled him
into the country.

18:16.829 --> 18:19.132
Aloha!

18:19.166 --> 18:20.267
Sorry, I'm just-I'm really cold,

18:20.300 --> 18:21.501
so I'm trying to say words

18:21.534 --> 18:22.835
that make me feel more tropical.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.271
You have company.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.838
I'm sorry. Uh...

18:25.872 --> 18:27.840
Do you want me to call back?

18:27.874 --> 18:29.276
What do you got, Sebastian?

18:29.309 --> 18:30.677
Well, I got the goodies
that you sent.

18:30.710 --> 18:31.811
Uh, starting with the powder...

18:31.844 --> 18:32.812
LASALLE: What is it?

18:32.845 --> 18:34.547
Drugs

18:34.581 --> 18:35.548
No, it's dust.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.683
There's actually a ton

18:36.716 --> 18:37.684
of different kinds of dust.

18:37.717 --> 18:38.851
There's, uh, domestic,

18:38.885 --> 18:40.720
atmospheric, cosmic...

18:40.753 --> 18:42.655
I don't know what this is
just yet, but I'm into it.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.292
What about the phone we found
in Nolan's apartment?

18:45.325 --> 18:46.459
You found a phone?

18:46.493 --> 18:47.560
We need to see it.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.429
You'll have to wait your turn.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.464
Ah, well, the-the phone
had a pretty intricate

18:51.498 --> 18:53.266
encryption on it,
but I was able to crack it.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.868
I found these.

18:55.902 --> 18:56.936
Nolan's sister?

18:56.969 --> 18:59.206
Thought she said she wasn't
in contact with him.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.708
Photos suggest otherwise.

19:01.741 --> 19:02.575
Also, fun fact:

19:02.609 --> 19:04.611
one of the stops
on the Louisiana Cypress

19:04.644 --> 19:06.946
just happens
to be Mariana's hometown.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.781
So, uh, that's all I got.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.784
Uh, oh, wait, um, the phone
had some coded texts on it...

19:11.818 --> 19:12.785
Get it to Pat.

19:12.819 --> 19:13.820
On it.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.926
Look, I want to question
Nolan's sister.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.594
I'll talk to my director.

19:21.628 --> 19:22.729
You talk to yours.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.431
Till they both sign off,

19:24.464 --> 19:26.633
I don't want you anywhere
near that woman.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.203
Clear?

19:30.237 --> 19:33.340
Oh, we're clear.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.778
MARIANA:
Don't know what to tell you.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.280
I haven't seen Nolan,

19:40.313 --> 19:42.215
and have no idea
who took those photos.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.983
Nolan's prints are
on the porch swing.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.518
They are fresh.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.321
The photos, the train,
the prints--

19:48.355 --> 19:49.822
he came here to see you.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.258
Well, I didn't see him.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.959
Those were taken from far away.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.761
I didn't know I was being
photographed.
Okay.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.329
Explain the swing.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.967
Nolan used to sit on it
with our parents.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.535
After they died,

20:02.569 --> 20:06.706
he'd spend hours out here,
remembering.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.675
He must have come home
because he missed it.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.643
If he came all this way
to reminisce,

20:10.677 --> 20:12.011
why didn't he reach out to you?

20:12.044 --> 20:14.447
He must be protecting me.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.515
That man, the one
you say he's with?

20:15.548 --> 20:17.317
He's the monster.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.619
He must be threatening Nolan,
forcing him to do things.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.522
We've found no evidence that
your brother has been coerced.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.890
Then look harder.

20:23.923 --> 20:25.525
Tap my phones, follow me,
use me as bait.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.360
I don't care.
I just want him back.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.562
Whatever happens, please...

20:29.596 --> 20:31.898
don't let me lose him again.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.970
Hello, again.
Sebastian.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.806
What'd you find?

20:39.839 --> 20:41.274
I got more dust.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.975
I scienced the hell out of it.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.477
Sending the results
to your computer right now.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.012
Turns out,
that this particular dust

20:46.045 --> 20:50.049
is comprised of granite
particles and something called

20:50.082 --> 20:51.451
respirable crystalline silica.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.019
It's found mainly
on construction sites.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.488
Nolan renovating
his kitchen?

20:55.522 --> 20:56.556
Well, not exactly.

20:56.589 --> 20:57.990
See, modern day granite

20:58.024 --> 20:59.892
is treated with
a polyurethane water sealant,

20:59.926 --> 21:02.395
but this was sealant free,
meaning that it's old.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.930
Like, at least
a hundred years old,

21:03.963 --> 21:06.633
back when it was the primary
building block of tombstones.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.602
Well, he's been visiting one
of the city's many cemeteries.

21:09.636 --> 21:10.937
Yeah, and I know
exactly which one, too.

21:10.970 --> 21:14.441
I cross-referenced
cemeteries built before 1915

21:14.474 --> 21:17.009
with current construction sites
and only got one result.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.578
Lafayette.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.413
Them CIA blowhards
can kiss my chiseled behind.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.415
You gonna have to get
in line, Triple P.

21:22.449 --> 21:23.416
You find something?

21:23.450 --> 21:24.417
Man, I cracked the texts

21:24.451 --> 21:25.985
on Nolan Griffith's cell phone.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.087
The one that Sebastian
couldn't decipher.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.489
Oh, I didn't even try

21:29.522 --> 21:30.857
because I had more
pressing matters

21:30.890 --> 21:32.525
than high-school-level decoding.

21:32.559 --> 21:35.094
Only looks simple if you don't
know what you're doing.

21:35.127 --> 21:35.962
At first glance,

21:35.995 --> 21:38.698
it seems like
a standard AES encryption,

21:38.731 --> 21:43.069
but it turns out to be
the 224-bit Rijndael cypher.

21:43.102 --> 21:45.972
Less high school, more NSA.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.440
Our missing Corpsman--

21:47.474 --> 21:49.008
he's been sending and receiving
date and time

21:49.041 --> 21:50.610
from another burner.

21:50.643 --> 21:54.447
Last text contains tomorrow's
date at 9:00 a.m.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.082
SEBASTIAN:
Anyway, uh, for what it's worth,

21:56.115 --> 21:58.418
given the amount of dust that
was found in Nolan's apartment,

21:58.451 --> 22:00.587
he'd have to be making frequent
trips to that cemetery.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.122
Seeing how there's
hundreds of tourists

22:03.155 --> 22:04.991
visiting Lafayette
Cemetery a day,

22:05.024 --> 22:07.326
makes it an attractive target.

22:12.599 --> 22:14.367
Guy in a red hoodie.

22:14.401 --> 22:16.969
Can't get a view of his face.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.405
Heading your way, Brody.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.975
Negative.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.011
Just a happy family.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.447
LASALLE :
I got a visual.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.081
North corner.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.958
He's looking for someone.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.964
Or something.
Maybe a signal?

22:48.134 --> 22:49.135
LASALLE:
Yeah, it could be a detonator.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.804
Okay, move in now.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.740
Nolan Griffith-- NCIS!

22:53.773 --> 22:55.408
Put your hands up!
PRIDE:
Easy.

22:55.442 --> 22:57.677
Nowhere to go.
Drop it!

22:57.710 --> 22:59.145
Here to help you.
You can't do this.

22:59.178 --> 23:01.147
You want to explain?

23:01.180 --> 23:03.382
You drop it,
or we take you out.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.419
Drop it.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.656
No, no, no. Get down here.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.529
GRIFFITH:
You're making a mistake.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.431
You take me in,
something awful's gonna happen.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.078
PRIDE: You gotta
talk to us, Corpsman.

23:32.979 --> 23:36.182
Whatever you're involved in,
it's not too late.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.884
We can stop it.

23:42.489 --> 23:43.756
We're gonna stay here.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.626
As long as it takes.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.864
The scar is not from Bashir.

23:51.898 --> 23:55.067
I got it when I escaped
from my kidnappers.

23:55.101 --> 23:56.736
You escaped?
Yes.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.605
The night that
they thought you died.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.807
I almost did.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.842
One of my captors
set off a bomb.

24:02.875 --> 24:06.679
I was hurt,
but I could still run.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.214
I passed out somewhere
in the mountains,

24:08.247 --> 24:10.750
and when I woke up,
I was in a tiny, remote village,

24:10.783 --> 24:11.918
with my neck splayed open.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.920
How'd you survive?

24:13.953 --> 24:15.955
There was a woman...

24:16.789 --> 24:18.958
...kind of like
the town's nurse.

24:18.991 --> 24:21.828
Nasima.

24:21.861 --> 24:22.629
She sewed me up.

24:22.662 --> 24:26.165
She-she nursed me
back to health.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.868
We f... we fell in love.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.938
And, eventually,
we got married.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.907
That's a nice story, son.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.712
Having trouble buying it.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.849
Why didn't you contact the U.S.?

24:42.882 --> 24:45.885
The village had no communication
infrastructure.

24:45.918 --> 24:48.220
It took me months to get better.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.757
By the time I could travel,
I-I did.

24:50.790 --> 24:51.924
I found a NATO base.

24:51.958 --> 24:53.860
Not on your records.

24:53.893 --> 24:56.195
No, sir, because it never
officially happened.

24:56.228 --> 24:57.630
It's part of the plan.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.165
The plan?

24:59.198 --> 25:01.568
Nasima's third cousin
is Aman Bashir.

25:04.103 --> 25:07.874
Chatter said... he was planning
an attack on U.S. soil.

25:07.907 --> 25:10.076
They wanted me to join him,
undercover.

25:10.109 --> 25:14.046
You want us to believe
that you convinced Bashir

25:14.080 --> 25:18.551
that a U.S. Navy sailor
switched sides?

25:18.585 --> 25:21.754
I married a Pakistani.

25:21.788 --> 25:23.255
Bashir's flesh and blood.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.591
I lived among them.

25:24.624 --> 25:25.592
Believe what you want,

25:25.625 --> 25:26.726
but I convinced Bashir

25:26.759 --> 25:28.895
my perspective had changed.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.096
If all this is true,

25:30.129 --> 25:31.898
then when you and Bashir
crossed the border,

25:31.931 --> 25:33.800
why didn't you go to the police
right away?

25:33.833 --> 25:35.902
Bashir's not the only one here.

25:35.935 --> 25:37.970
He's planning multiple attacks.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.806
I... He sent me to Chicago

25:39.839 --> 25:43.309
to drop money to another
one of his men.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.144
New Orleans is
just the beginning.

25:45.177 --> 25:47.146
Who's the other man?

25:47.179 --> 25:48.881
What's the operation?

25:50.382 --> 25:52.585
When is it gonna happen?

25:52.619 --> 25:53.586
I don't know!

25:53.620 --> 25:54.821
Come on, man!
I don't know!

25:54.854 --> 25:55.855
I would tell you,

25:55.888 --> 25:57.590
but I don't know.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.827
I never met the other guy.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.028
I just made the drop.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.896
Bashir keeps us separate.

26:03.930 --> 26:05.865
E-Everything is
on a need-to-know basis.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.867
All I do know

26:07.900 --> 26:11.971
is I have to meet
Bashir today at 3:00 p.m.

26:13.973 --> 26:16.042
I have spent months--

26:16.075 --> 26:19.011
months-- gaining Bashir's
confidence.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.047
If I don't show up today,

26:21.080 --> 26:23.315
he will know
that I am blown,

26:23.349 --> 26:24.951
and we will lose him.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.152
Who's we?

26:26.185 --> 26:28.054
My CIA handler.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.793
I need Calloway
here right away.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.094
I'm on it.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.796
You ain't believing this crap,
are you, King?

26:36.829 --> 26:37.797
Don't know what to believe.

26:37.830 --> 26:38.931
He's just stalling us

26:38.965 --> 26:39.866
until the attack.

26:39.899 --> 26:40.967
NCIS.
Maybe so,
but he's our only link.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.234
That's why I need to talk

26:42.268 --> 26:43.335
to Calloway direct.

26:43.369 --> 26:45.004
Find him?

26:45.037 --> 26:46.939
No, but NOPD did.

26:50.176 --> 26:53.880
Witness came out for a smoke,
saw the blood, called it in.

26:53.913 --> 26:56.983
NOPD noticed Calloway's
Belle Chasse visitor's pass.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.686
WADE: Dwayne, I figured you'd
hear about this one.

26:59.719 --> 27:02.054
It's multiple stab wounds
to the neck and torso.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.023
Assailant came
at him from behind.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.092
So, Calloway...

27:06.125 --> 27:09.829
came to the cemetery
to meet up with Nolan.

27:09.862 --> 27:12.832
Bashir saw him tailing Nolan,
grabbed him.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.434
Yeah, or Nolan killed him,
and his whole story's a sham.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.969
BRODY: Nolan is
trained with a knife.

27:17.003 --> 27:19.038
He killed Hendrich
by severing an artery.

27:19.071 --> 27:20.039
Yeah, Merri's right.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.073
This is sloppier.

27:21.107 --> 27:22.709
Any idea
time of death?

27:22.742 --> 27:24.010
I'll know more in a few hours.

27:24.043 --> 27:25.812
Yeah, well, we've got
exactly two of those

27:25.845 --> 27:27.279
before Nolan's supposed
to meet with Bashir.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.748
Yeah, if we let him go,

27:28.781 --> 27:30.116
he's gonna help attack
New Orleans.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.851
Or help us save it.

27:33.920 --> 27:36.756
Thanks a lot, Charlie,
much appreciated.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.859
NOPD canvassed the street
Calloway was killed on.

27:39.892 --> 27:42.895
An old woman said she saw

27:42.929 --> 27:44.831
a white utility truck
with some ad on the side.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.399
Sounds like the same truck
I saw Bashir escape in.

27:47.433 --> 27:48.467
She get plates?

27:48.500 --> 27:49.836
She did not.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.103
Wasn't wearing her glasses.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.106
No hits on the BOLO.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.441
You get anything?

27:55.474 --> 27:56.976
A major case of the willies.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.911
You ever been inside
a terrorist chat room?

27:58.945 --> 28:00.412
It's not on my bucket list.

28:00.446 --> 28:03.082
Yeah, well, it's...
pretty disturbing.

28:03.115 --> 28:06.018
A lot of chatter
about an imminent attack,

28:06.052 --> 28:08.087
and NOLA is listed
more than once.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.088
Hear anything
about a target?

28:09.121 --> 28:10.957
Superdome's popular.

28:10.990 --> 28:11.991
Football season's over.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.125
Okay, well, there is

28:13.159 --> 28:14.961
a NASCAR thingy
at Motorsports Park...

28:14.994 --> 28:16.996
It's not NASCAR, it's Indy.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.831
There's a difference?

28:18.865 --> 28:20.867
Please don't tell me
what it is.

28:23.335 --> 28:26.272
Question:
why are you so sure

28:26.305 --> 28:29.742
Nolan's telling the truth?

28:34.847 --> 28:36.849
His story is messy.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.117
You create a fake back story,

28:38.150 --> 28:39.151
it is clear.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.419
It's simple.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.188
And the way he talks
about his wife...

28:42.221 --> 28:43.890
he loves her.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.925
Yeah, I bet he does.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.027
Enough to get in bed
with her insurgent family.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.229
He risked his life on that train
to save those people.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.297
Why do that?

28:53.165 --> 28:55.201
Why are you so sure
Nolan's lying?

28:55.234 --> 28:58.237
Well, he was missing
for four years.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.539
I mean, you hang
around crazy long enough,

29:00.572 --> 29:03.142
be hard not to get suckered in.

29:03.175 --> 29:05.377
You lie with dogs,
you wake up with fleas.

29:05.411 --> 29:08.147
You're assuming that's
all he experienced.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.882
Nolan's captors did
terrible things,

29:09.916 --> 29:13.352
but the people who found him...
they saved his life.

29:13.385 --> 29:16.188
I mean, that would be enough
to renew my faith in humanity.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.124
Well, that says something
about you,

29:18.157 --> 29:19.458
not Nolan Griffith.

29:19.491 --> 29:20.827
All right,
at the end of the day,

29:20.860 --> 29:22.194
we don't know who this joker is.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.897
Maybe what he went through
made him stronger,

29:24.931 --> 29:28.267
but maybe it just
made him angrier.

29:46.152 --> 29:48.120
Calloway's dead.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.562
What happened?

29:56.595 --> 29:58.164
Stabbing at the cemetery.

30:02.001 --> 30:04.470
Bashir.

30:04.503 --> 30:08.407
After you found the apartment,
he knew someone was on to us.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.609
He must have followed me.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.311
Checked with his bosses.

30:12.344 --> 30:16.248
They deny knowing
anything about your op.

30:16.282 --> 30:17.449
It's the CIA.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.151
They deny everything.

30:23.189 --> 30:26.292
It's just you and me, Corpsman.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.161
And it's 1:47.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.977
When I was held captive,

30:47.013 --> 30:49.381
they beat me.

30:49.415 --> 30:52.351
They starved me.

30:52.384 --> 30:55.254
There were times
I wanted to die.

30:57.456 --> 31:01.193
But I couldn't let my sister
lose anyone else.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.633
But you got out...

31:09.201 --> 31:10.970
...so you claim.

31:13.405 --> 31:16.108
Why would you go back?

31:18.010 --> 31:20.112
Nasima.

31:21.680 --> 31:23.015
She took me in.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.085
She took care of me.

31:26.118 --> 31:29.021
I hadn't felt that
kind of belonging since...

31:29.055 --> 31:32.291
since before
my parents died...

31:32.324 --> 31:37.396
and I wasn't about to leave
Nasima behind.

31:37.429 --> 31:42.935
So, the CIA used your wife

31:42.969 --> 31:45.271
to blackmail you
into helping them?

31:48.240 --> 31:51.343
If they did that to me...

31:51.377 --> 31:54.613
I can't tell you what
I might be capable of.

32:00.219 --> 32:04.190
Sir...

32:04.223 --> 32:06.592
I did not kill Adam Calloway.

32:09.461 --> 32:14.333
And yes... I was angry.

32:16.268 --> 32:19.571
I was angry... at first,

32:19.605 --> 32:21.140
but when I learned that Bashir

32:21.173 --> 32:25.377
was really planning
an attack...

32:25.411 --> 32:27.246
I had to stop him.

32:29.315 --> 32:31.617
I think you would, too.

32:35.154 --> 32:38.024
LASALLE : You should
not have let him go.

32:41.293 --> 32:44.296
I do not like this.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.198
I'm losing sight of him.

32:46.232 --> 32:47.433
BRODY:
I got him.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.171
BRODY : He's headed
north on Royal Street.

32:54.073 --> 32:55.441
Tracker's working.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.343
:
Just maintain visual contact.

32:59.345 --> 33:00.412
We're losing him.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.282
LASALLE:
He's going around a corner.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.217
Look like he's
heading in an alley.

33:10.422 --> 33:11.357
Oh, no.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.166
Nolan's tracker.

33:20.199 --> 33:21.567
He's gone, King.
He played us.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.701
We don't know that.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.170
Well, do you see
him anywhere?

33:24.203 --> 33:25.404
Look, he ditched us

33:25.437 --> 33:27.039
and left this here
as a memento.

33:27.073 --> 33:29.675
Reality is we don't know
what side he's on...

33:29.708 --> 33:33.345
but we're prepared for anything,
right, Patton?

33:33.379 --> 33:35.347
I been tracking our guy
the whole time.

33:35.381 --> 33:37.316
Double tracking by Triple P.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.251
I'm glad somebody's
playing it smart.

33:39.285 --> 33:40.452
So, where is he, Patton?

33:40.486 --> 33:41.620
Well, that's the thing.

33:41.653 --> 33:43.322
I got eyes all over NOLA,

33:43.355 --> 33:45.624
but there are 1,600 miles
of sewer below our fair city

33:45.657 --> 33:47.426
and I can't see into them.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.395
If our corpsman decided to go
in the manhole,

33:49.428 --> 33:52.498
he could literally
be anywhere right now.

34:03.542 --> 34:04.776
It's all a big con.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.245
He used us.

34:06.278 --> 34:08.114
How long ago did Nolan
go into the sewers?

34:08.147 --> 34:09.748
14 minutes and 32 seconds.

34:09.781 --> 34:12.084
Long enough to go about
two miles?

34:12.118 --> 34:14.220
I'd give it a mile and a half
the most.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.088
All right, gives us
a starting point.

34:16.122 --> 34:17.689
Check all the exits
within the perimeter.

34:17.723 --> 34:18.690
Way ahead of you.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.426
We got dead ends, two stretches,

34:20.459 --> 34:21.860
no exits within that time frame.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.862
He could still
be down there.
PATTON: Maybe.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.231
If he hasn't surfaced already

34:25.264 --> 34:26.865
at one of the four
possible locations.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.136
Okay, I'm checking on traffic
cams, surveillance footage,

34:30.169 --> 34:31.270
checking all angles.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.771
Oh, hell, yeah!
I got something!

34:32.804 --> 34:34.506
I got a guy matching
Nolan's description

34:34.540 --> 34:36.308
getting in the back
of a white truck.

34:36.342 --> 34:39.111
Overman Heating and Air
Condition stenciled on the side.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.812
LASALLE: That's the truck
I saw Bashir in,

34:40.846 --> 34:44.150
and a witness saw the same truck
at Calloway's crime scene.

34:44.183 --> 34:45.851
It just passed through
the traffic cam in The Quarter.

34:45.884 --> 34:48.287
Dozens of soft targets.
Hotels.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.322
Any events flagged
in the security alerts?

34:50.356 --> 34:51.790
The Matisse Hotel.
Economic summit.

34:51.823 --> 34:53.725
Focus is how U.S. aid

34:53.759 --> 34:55.327
positively affects
the relationship

34:55.361 --> 34:57.129
between the Middle East
and West.

34:57.163 --> 35:00.866
Okay, checking
Matisse security cam...

35:00.899 --> 35:03.202
got your white truck
pulling into the back entrance.

35:03.235 --> 35:06.205
All right, get NOPD and SWAT,
and have them meet us there now.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.876
(various indistinct
conversations)

35:20.586 --> 35:21.820
NCIS!

35:21.853 --> 35:23.789
Get your hands up.
Get them up!

35:30.229 --> 35:32.164
BRODY:
Empty.

35:33.665 --> 35:35.501
Burner phone,
same make as the one

35:35.534 --> 35:36.835
we found in Nolan's apartment.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.870
Where are they, huh?

35:38.904 --> 35:39.871
Where they at?

35:39.905 --> 35:40.939
Huh?

35:40.972 --> 35:42.774
Where's Bashir?

35:42.808 --> 35:44.643
SWAT team is ten minutes out.
NOPD is on the way.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.645
We can't wait.
Where the hell are they?

35:46.678 --> 35:48.214
It's got to be up there.
Yeah, it leads right

35:48.247 --> 35:48.914
to the summit, King.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.416
Alert... Alert hotel security

35:50.449 --> 35:52.618
we're going
to evacuate the hotel.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.786
Brody, you're with me.

35:54.820 --> 35:55.954
We gotta find them now.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.623
Go.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.965
What the hell, Bashir?

36:06.998 --> 36:08.900
Do you want to stop
pointing that gun at me?

36:08.934 --> 36:10.936
Someone has found
the apartment.

36:10.969 --> 36:12.971
You were being tailed.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.774
We're dealing with this now?

36:15.807 --> 36:18.444
Your timing's for crap.

36:18.477 --> 36:21.713
I need to find out
if there were others.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.815
How should I know?

36:25.984 --> 36:29.221
Take this.

36:29.255 --> 36:30.556
Your part is now.

36:34.926 --> 36:35.894
Move. Move.

36:35.927 --> 36:38.230
All right. All right.

36:39.498 --> 36:40.866
LASALLE:
Everything is all right.

36:40.899 --> 36:42.368
Just keep heading to the exits.

36:42.401 --> 36:43.802
Keep it moving.

36:43.835 --> 36:46.372
King, we're getting
everybody out,

36:46.405 --> 36:48.940
but there's still no signs
of Nolan or Bashir.

36:48.974 --> 36:50.476
Well, they're here somewhere.

36:50.509 --> 36:52.278
They changed clothes.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.313
If the summit isn't
their target, then what is?

36:54.346 --> 36:56.382
Who isn't accounted for?

36:56.415 --> 36:58.650
Got a list of attendees here.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.952
Keynote speaker is
Vice President of IMF,

37:00.986 --> 37:02.654
Marie Lovatelli.

37:02.688 --> 37:04.890
She's supposed to give
a speech in ten minutes.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.292
Where is she now?

37:06.325 --> 37:07.393
I think she's still
in her room, King.

37:09.428 --> 37:10.396
Yes?

37:10.429 --> 37:12.030
Ma'am, hotel security.

37:12.063 --> 37:14.300
Here to escort you
to the ballroom.

37:14.333 --> 37:16.001
Of course.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.263
Watch my back.

37:49.034 --> 37:52.871
Shoot anything that comes
out of this elevator.

37:56.442 --> 37:57.543
Federal agents!

37:57.576 --> 37:59.010
BRODY:
Drop your weapons!

37:59.044 --> 38:00.912
LASALLE:
Got you surrounded, Bashir.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.614
PRIDE:
Put it down!

38:03.482 --> 38:04.650
Nowhere to go, Bashir.

38:17.496 --> 38:20.031
Damn you.

38:20.065 --> 38:21.367
It's done, Bashir.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.701
Put your weapons down.

38:22.734 --> 38:23.702
Nolan, you too.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.604
LASALLE:
Get on your knees.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.038
PRIDE:
Listen to me.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.074
Easy.

38:29.107 --> 38:31.777
All right.

38:34.580 --> 38:37.616
Putting it down.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.050
PRIDE:
Easy.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.623
Nolan!

38:49.695 --> 38:51.597
Got a grenade.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.602
Spoon is still intact.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.689
It's over now, Corpsman.

39:21.092 --> 39:24.396
There'll be a ceremony
for the Bronze Star,

39:24.430 --> 39:27.132
and the Navy owes you
a whole lot of back pay.

39:27.165 --> 39:30.068
Not to mention
a debt of gratitude.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.137
Bashir and the men with him

39:32.170 --> 39:34.906
were planning attacks
on three cities.

39:34.940 --> 39:38.143
Thanks to your help,
we were able to stop them.

39:38.176 --> 39:40.846
Hey...

39:40.879 --> 39:43.582
you're not hearing a word
I'm saying, are you?

39:43.615 --> 39:45.050
I'm sorry, sir, I...

39:45.083 --> 39:47.185
I-I know you said the flight
got in safely, but...

39:47.218 --> 39:48.186
I understand.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.621
Right through here.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.561
GRIFFITH:
Nasima.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.128
Oh, my God.

40:02.768 --> 40:05.136
Baby brother.

40:05.170 --> 40:06.404
:
Mariana.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.211
GRIFFITH:
You met Nasima?

40:13.244 --> 40:14.880
MARIANA:
Of course.

40:14.913 --> 40:15.914
And your son.

40:15.947 --> 40:17.649
He came early.

40:17.683 --> 40:19.184
He's healthy and strong.

40:19.217 --> 40:22.220
:
Da, da, da...

40:23.522 --> 40:24.790
Like his father.

40:24.823 --> 40:26.625
Here, hold him.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.869
BRODY:
I was right about Nolan.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.205
First time for
everything, right?

40:41.573 --> 40:44.175
LASALLE:
Ah, I'm glad you were.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.545
I like a storybook ending.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.080
