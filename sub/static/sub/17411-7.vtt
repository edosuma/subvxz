06:52.679 --> 06:54.746
     - ALL RIGHT, I BET 20
         TO YOU, ANDY.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.648
  SO YOU CAN FOLD NOW, OR YOU
   CAN FOLD AN HOUR FROM NOW.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.184
       - I WILL...RAISE.

06:59.186 --> 07:02.487
             - OOH.

07:02.489 --> 07:03.488
           - I FOLD.

07:03.490 --> 07:04.990
           - SHOCKER.
       CROSBY, YOU'RE UP.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.558
 - YOU SEE THIS ZONED-OUT LOOK?

07:06.560 --> 07:08.693
      THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
  RIGHT BEFORE SHE BLOWS MUD.

07:08.695 --> 07:11.563
           [chuckles]
 IT'S NOT--IT'S GONNA GET UGLY.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.632
IT'S NOT GONNA BE SOLID, 'CAUSE
   SHE ATE SO MANY APRICOTS.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.200
       - I'M NEVER EATING
        APRICOTS AGAIN.

07:15.202 --> 07:16.768
- CAN WE JUST PLAY THROUGH THIS?
ISN'T THAT WHAT A DIAPER IS FOR?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.203
      YOU KNOW, TO CONTAIN
         THE SITUATION?

07:18.205 --> 07:19.604
    - WE CAN'T PLAY THROUGH.

07:19.606 --> 07:20.806
     SHE'S GONNA BE SITTING
       IN HER OWN FILTH.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.875
        - DEAL YOU OUT?
  WE'RE ALREADY SHORT PLAYERS.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.844
- WHY ARE YOU GETTING SO UPSET?

07:25.846 --> 07:27.712
  - HE'S NOT UPSET ABOUT YOU,
   HE'S UPSET ABOUT A WOMAN.

07:27.714 --> 07:28.747
            - ANDY!
           - REALLY?

07:28.749 --> 07:30.182
 - DR. SAM WON'T CALL HIM BACK.

07:30.184 --> 07:31.783
 - HOLD ON. YOU'RE IN YOUR HEAD
         ABOUT A GIRL,

07:31.785 --> 07:33.151
    AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE--
          - I'M FINE.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.821
  - SO DR. SAM IS BLOWING OFF
    THE SELF-PROCLAIMED KING

07:35.823 --> 07:36.988
         OF ALL WOMEN?
        THIS IS AMAZING.

07:36.990 --> 07:41.593
        THIS POKER TABLE
     IS YOUR SACRED CIRCLE.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.694
    WE'RE ALL HERE FOR YOU.
          - ALL OF US.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.729
     - OKAY, I WILL OPEN UP
          TO YOU GUYS.

07:44.731 --> 07:47.699
I AM UPSET ABOUT A LOT OF WOMEN.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.967
      I'M UPSET ABOUT SAM,

07:48.969 --> 07:50.802
   I'M UPSET ABOUT YOU ACTING
         LIKE A WOMAN,

07:50.804 --> 07:53.205
      AND I'M UPSET ABOUT
       THE INFANT THAT IS

07:53.207 --> 07:55.774
    LITERALLY TAKING A CRAP
       ON MY POKER TABLE.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.776
 - THAT'S MY FAULT, I SHOULDN'T
    HAVE GIVEN HER APRICOTS.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.110
      - WILL, IT'S NOTHING
       TO BE ASHAMED OF.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.745
     I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
   TO GET BLOWN OFF BY WOMEN.

08:00.747 --> 08:01.746
         - POKER CHIP.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.748
         - NO, I DON'T.
        THAT WAS A LIE.

08:03.750 --> 08:04.816
 I'M GONNA GO TO THE BATHROOM.
      - OH, NO, ME FIRST.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.017
        FUSSY PROSTATE.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.018
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING OUTSIDE.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.253
         - OKAY, BINGO.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.788
             - OH!

08:09.790 --> 08:11.723
          - [laughing]
       OH, APRICOT CITY.

        [chanting plays]

08:21.167 --> 08:23.101
           - [sighs]

08:23.103 --> 08:25.237

 - OKAY, PLEASE STOP URINATING
          ON MY HEDGE.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.824

08:50.097 --> 08:51.830
           [laughter]

08:51.832 --> 08:53.665
 ACCENTS ARE HOT ON GIRLS, MAN.
       I DON'T KNOW WHY.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.801

- WELL, YOU SHOULD COME JOIN US,

09:01.308 --> 09:02.874
         BECAUSE WE'RE
      ABOUT TWO MEN SHORT,

09:02.876 --> 09:05.810
   AND I THINK YOU WOULD LOOK
   PRETTY CUTE AT THE TABLE.

09:05.812 --> 09:10.215
 - WELL, I'VE RATHER COMMITTED
 MYSELF TO THE BUDDHA TONIGHT,

09:10.217 --> 09:12.250
     BUT, UH,<i> BONNE CHANCE.</i>

09:12.252 --> 09:15.854

       - WELL, NO, WAIT,
     ACTUALLY, 'CAUSE, UH,

09:18.158 --> 09:20.992
   MIGHT BE QUITE FUN TO TAKE
   SOME MONEY OFF AMERICANS.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.295
       LOW-HANGING FRUIT,
      ETCETERA, ETCETERA.

09:23.297 --> 09:25.830
    - I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
      ANY FRUIT IN THERE.

09:25.832 --> 09:26.998
     - YOU CAN'T PLAY POKER
       WITH FOUR PEOPLE.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.300
            PLEASE?
            - WILL.

       AND I WILL DO IT.
- YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE A DIAPER?

09:38.612 --> 09:39.711
       - LOOK, IT DOESN'T
    EVEN BOTHER ME ANYMORE.

09:39.713 --> 09:40.879
            [sniffs]
         - OH, REALLY?

09:40.881 --> 09:42.814
         THAT DOESN'T--
       - IT DOESN'T EV--

09:42.816 --> 09:46.818
       - GOOD NEWS, GUYS.
      I FOUND FRESH MEAT.

09:46.820 --> 09:47.986

           A PLAYER.

               .

10:07.741 --> 10:12.243
           - SUCKER.
     I CALL YOUR CRAP HAND.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.212
       - I THINK YOU MEAN
        MY LOW STRAIGHT.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.047
             - OH!
           both: OOH!

10:16.049 --> 10:19.284

  THIS HEART ATTACK IN A BOWL?

10:19.286 --> 10:21.119
    MY ARTERIES ARE CLOGGING
      JUST LOOKING AT IT.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.754
       - EAT THE NAPKINS.
     THEY'RE HIGH IN FIBER.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.055
  - THERE'S HUMMUS AND PEPPERS
         IN THE FRIDGE.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.824
      - NOT IN MY FRIDGE.
          - AFRAID SO.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.626
   I PUT SOME IN THE CRISPER
          FOR MARCUS.

10:27.628 --> 10:30.895
      - THANK YOU, FIONA.
    - I LOVE ME SOME HUMMUS.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.364
         I'M GONNA GET
      MY MEDITERRANEAN ON.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.399
       - UH, YEAH, HUMMUS
    IS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.400
    PRETTY SURE ABOUT THAT.

10:35.402 --> 10:39.204
  I NEED SOMETHING TO COAT MY
STOMACH FROM THAT BOWL OF DEATH.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.905
 - HERE'S THE DEAL, ALL RIGHT?

10:40.907 --> 10:43.842
   YOU CRASHED MY POKER GAME,
   WHICH IS AN OFFENSE TO ME,

10:43.844 --> 10:46.077
  BUT NOW YOU'RE DERAILING IT
 WITH FARMERS' MARKET CUISINE,

10:46.079 --> 10:47.746
      WHICH IS AN OFFENSE
     TO THE GAME OF POKER.

10:47.748 --> 10:48.980
  DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

10:48.982 --> 10:50.849
   - WILL, I THINK EVERYONE'S
         GONNA SURVIVE.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.951
        - AAH, MY BACK!
      MY BACK IS SPASMING!

10:52.953 --> 10:54.819

            HOLD ON.
            - OKAY.

10:56.757 --> 10:59.157
 THIS IS A MUCH DEEPER PROBLEM.
   - OKAY, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.692
             - AAH!
       - GOT ONE ARM OUT.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.994
      - NOW, HAVE YOU EVER
       DONE YOGA BEFORE?

11:02.996 --> 11:05.163
- NO, BUT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.765
      - OKAY, WELL WELCOME

11:08.935 --> 11:10.435
  NOW, ON YOUR KNEES, PLEASE.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.804
   - OKAY, I LIKE THIS, OKAY.
   - AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

11:12.806 --> 11:14.806
    IS A LOVELY MOVE CALLED
       CAT COW WHERE YOU

11:14.808 --> 11:17.008
      FLEX YOUR SPINE UP,

11:17.010 --> 11:19.377
 AND THEN YOU RELEASE IT DOWN.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.712
    ALL ARE WELCOME TO JOIN.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.113
        - YEAH, I'M IN.
             GOOD.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.016

           - UH--OH.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.820
OH, YOU'RE GOING TO FLEX IT UP.

     - AND RELEASE IT DOWN.
           - [grunts]

11:29.723 --> 11:30.955
            - DOWN.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.757
  - FIONA, I'VE GOT THIS NASTY
        SHOULDER CRIMP.

11:32.759 --> 11:35.326
      - EXCUSE ME, PEOPLE?
 HI, WE'RE NOT HERE TO STRETCH.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.795
   WE'RE NOT HERE TO UNCRIMP.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.363
     WE'RE NOT HERE TO GET
     OUR MEDITERRANEAN ON.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.266
   CAN WE PLEASE PLAY POKER?

11:41.268 --> 11:45.403
         [all shouting]

11:45.405 --> 11:47.305
     game voice: TOUCHDOWN!

11:47.307 --> 11:48.873

11:50.377 --> 11:52.744
      - UH, YEAH, THAT'S--
     THAT'S PRETTY UNSAFE.

11:52.746 --> 11:53.945
      YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
      GET DOWN FROM THERE.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.114
       THAT IS DANGEROUS.
     [overlapping chatter]

11:56.116 --> 11:59.417
  - I KNEW I COULD HAVE SCORED
    ON ANOTHER PLAY BEFORE,

11:59.419 --> 12:01.119
          BUT I WANTED
   TO DISH OUT MAXIMUM PAIN.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.187
 - OH, YEAH, THAT'S A STRATEGY

12:02.189 --> 12:04.322
   I WOULD NOT SECOND-GUESS.
            NO WAY.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.091
    - LET'S SEE YOUR MOVES.
       HOW GOOD ARE YOU?

12:06.093 --> 12:08.493

12:12.866 --> 12:14.232
       FIELD GOAL, YEAH!

12:14.234 --> 12:16.735
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.

12:16.737 --> 12:21.072
 WE USED TO PLAY THIS BRILLIANT
    GAME CALLED OXFORD STUD.

12:21.074 --> 12:25.176
  IT'S SORT OF LIKE IF HOLD'EM
AND SEVEN CARD STUD HAD A BABY.

12:25.178 --> 12:28.513
    - BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE,
       WITH THIS GROUP--

12:28.515 --> 12:30.381
      - I DO REMEMBER THAT
     WE'D BEGIN EVERY DEAL

12:30.383 --> 12:31.950
        BY DOING A SHOT,
     BUT WE CAN SKIP THAT.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.119
        - SHOTS! I'M IN.
            - OKAY.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.521
     I'M STICKING WITH BEER
      AND AMERICAN POKER.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.022
     - I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY--

12:38.024 --> 12:39.791
      I DON'T REALLY DRINK
         HARD LIQUOR...

12:39.793 --> 12:41.359
        - CAN YOU WATCH
      THE TABLE WITH THAT?

12:41.361 --> 12:44.162
      - METHINKS THE LADY
  WILL HAVE SOME HARD LIQUOR.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.997
     - OH, DO YOU THINK SO?
    - ARE YOU DOING A SHOT?

12:45.999 --> 12:48.299
     - YEAH, I'M DOING IT.
         - ONE FOR DAD?

12:48.301 --> 12:50.001
             - AH!
             - AAH!

12:50.003 --> 12:52.137
            - OKAY.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.305
         - OH,<i> NAMASTE!</i>
            [laughs]

      OF THE WHOLE NIGHT.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.077

14:40.380 --> 14:41.646
      YOU GOT ALL MOROSE.

14:41.648 --> 14:42.881

        NO, THAT'S GOOD.
       <i> MY</i> FRIENDS, OKAY?

14:50.557 --> 14:53.625
     IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT
 YOUR ONLY FRIEND IS YOUR SON.

14:57.096 --> 14:58.463
     - NO, I MEAN--NO, I--

14:58.465 --> 14:59.998
         'CAUSE I-I'M--
   YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUSH ME.

            I'LL GO.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.968
             - NO!
 - THAT'S ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.537
IT'S BEEN AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE.

15:07.606 --> 15:09.974
    I KNOW YOU'RE BLUFFING.

15:10.976 --> 15:14.145
     - THAT WAS ROUGH, MAN.
             FIONA!

15:17.983 --> 15:20.051
       - I ACTUALLY THINK
    I'M GONNA HIT IT TOO...

15:20.053 --> 15:23.254
          AFTER I GET
    A LITTLE CAT COW ACTION.

15:29.161 --> 15:31.195
          - SO CREAMY.

15:34.466 --> 15:34.699
               .

15:34.701 --> 15:38.703
  - I WAS ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE
  MY FIRST YEAR AT UNIVERSITY.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.972
      AND THEN I STUMBLED
       INTO A POKER GAME,

15:40.974 --> 15:42.206
         AND THEY WERE
     THE ONLY NICE PEOPLE,

15:42.208 --> 15:43.241
   THE PEOPLE PLAYING POKER,

15:43.243 --> 15:44.976
AND THEN THEY BECAME MY FRIENDS.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.312
 AND THEY TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.481
   THEY TAUGHT ME HOW TO BET
       AND HOW TO BLUFF--

15:50.483 --> 15:53.017
- NO, THEY DIDN'T TEACH ME THAT.
            - OKAY.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.620
  - THEY TAUGHT ME HOW TO PLAY

15:55.622 --> 15:58.690
WHEN YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY TROLLIED.

15:58.692 --> 15:59.724
          - TROLLIED.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.225
- I DON'T EVER DO THIS ANYMORE.

16:01.227 --> 16:04.228
    THE ONLY TIME THAT I GET
    MY CARDS OUT THESE DAYS

16:04.230 --> 16:08.366
   IS ON A FRIDAY NIGHT WHEN
  I PLAY GO FISH WITH MY SON.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.969
    - DO YOU HAVE ANY JACKS?

16:10.971 --> 16:11.970
           - GO FISH.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.305
      - [inhales sharply]
              AH!

16:14.307 --> 16:16.207
     ALL RIGHT, YOUR TURN.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.176
           - I FOLD.
     CAN I PLEASE GO HOME?

16:18.178 --> 16:20.211
         - DO YOU THINK
   I WAS TOO HARSH ON FIONA?

16:20.213 --> 16:22.213
        - I DON'T THINK
     YOU WERE HARSH ENOUGH.

16:22.215 --> 16:25.149
           - REALLY?
- OF COURSE YOU WERE TOO HARSH.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.551
    SHE WAS JUST BEING FUN,

16:26.553 --> 16:28.653
AND THEN YOU COULDN'T HANDLE IT.
      IT WAS REALLY WEIRD.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.222
          - ALL RIGHT.
      POKER NIGHT'S OVER.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.057
        [phone ringing]
             - MM!

16:33.059 --> 16:34.225
    IT'S MY MOBILE, HOLD ON.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.360

      OOH, IT'S MY MOBILE.

16:35.362 --> 16:38.763
      - OOH, WHY IS THAT--
 - WHY IS THAT MOBILE RINGING?

16:38.765 --> 16:40.331
          - BISCUITS.
           - [laughs]

16:40.333 --> 16:42.066
     - I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT
           BISCUITS.

16:42.068 --> 16:43.768
             - AH.
             - HEY.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.237
      - [gasps] SHH! PSSH!
             - OH!

16:49.109 --> 16:52.243
            - OKAY.

  ANOTHER SCARY MOVIE TONIGHT.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.249
 I AM NOT BUILT FOR SLEEPOVERS.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.018
    GET ME OUT OF HERE NOW.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.786
        [monster roars,
       and woman screams]

17:01.788 --> 17:05.423
         PLEASE HURRY.
        [monster roars]

17:05.425 --> 17:07.358
          - YEAH, BYE,
      I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.227
             RIGHT,
   I'M GONNA NEED ONE OF YOU

17:09.229 --> 17:13.097
       TO DRIVE ME TO GET
      MY MARCUS SON, AND--

17:13.098 --> 17:15.233
         OH, BOLLOCKS!

17:15.234 --> 17:18.069

    [The Lumineers'<i> Ho Hey]</i>

            - DITTO.
    - BUT I NEED YOUR HELP.

             - HA!

17:32.217 --> 17:34.585

18:00.313 --> 18:02.346
         - YEAH, FINE.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.515
      JUST GOT TO WAIT FOR
 THE UNIVERSE TO STOP SPINNING

18:04.517 --> 18:06.384
   AT SUCH AN UNGODLY SPEED.
           - MM-HMM.

       I'M SORRY I RUINED

18:11.124 --> 18:13.324
        YOUR POKER NIGHT
    WITH YOUR MATES TONIGHT.

18:13.326 --> 18:16.327
    BUT IT WAS A FUN NIGHT,
           WASN'T IT?

18:16.329 --> 18:18.362
 THE MOST FUN I'VE HAD IN AGES.

18:18.364 --> 18:23.868
          IT WAS GREAT
    TO FEEL LIKE I BELONGED.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.404
          [door opens]
           OH, DEAR.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.639
I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD ABANDON

18:28.641 --> 18:29.874
         THE SLEEPOVER.
         [door closes]

18:29.876 --> 18:31.476
         I DON'T THINK
      THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.877
I THINK I'VE GOT TO TALK TO HIM.

18:32.879 --> 18:36.280
 - HONESTLY, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
      MINTS IN THE WORLD.

18:36.282 --> 18:38.583
           - [groans]
    - GET--JUST DON'T TALK.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.719
  - IT'S JUST A BLOODY MUTANT
       WAR ZONE IN THERE.

18:41.721 --> 18:45.490
I MEAN, THEY ARE WATCHING THINGS
     THAT HAVE NO BUSINESS

18:45.492 --> 18:47.358
  BEING CALLED ENTERTAINMENT.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.594
           - [sighs]

18:49.596 --> 18:53.631
    - WHY ISN'T MOM TALKING?
          - UH, SHE--

18:53.633 --> 18:56.501
    SHE LOST HER VOICE BEING
  AN AWESOME DEALER IN POKER.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.269
             YEAH.
           - WELL...

18:58.271 --> 18:59.737
          I KNOW THAT
    I MAY NEVER GET INVITED

18:59.739 --> 19:04.709
   BUT THERE IS JUST--THERE'S
NO WAY I'M GOING BACK IN THERE.

19:04.711 --> 19:08.312
     C-CAN WE JUST GO HOME?

19:10.716 --> 19:12.750
    - UH, MARCUS, YOU KNOW,

19:12.752 --> 19:14.318
     WE'RE GONNA DEFINITELY
         TAKE YOU HOME

19:14.320 --> 19:15.820
 IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GO HOME,

19:15.822 --> 19:18.756
     BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK
  IF YOU TRY TO STICK IT OUT,

19:18.758 --> 19:22.760
      AT HOW COOL IT FEELS
      TO BELONG, YOU KNOW?

19:22.762 --> 19:26.297
    - BUT THAT MOVIE IS JUST
    SO EMOTIONALLY SCARRING.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.699
         - YEAH, UM...

19:30.669 --> 19:34.372
  YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID,

19:34.374 --> 19:36.574
I WAS SO SCARED OF THE DENTIST.

19:36.576 --> 19:39.243
  BUT THEN ONE DAY I REALIZED,
   WHAT'S THE SCARIEST PART?

19:39.245 --> 19:41.245
   IT'S THE SOUND, YOU KNOW?

19:41.247 --> 19:43.514
       AND IF YOU GET RID
   OF THE SOUND OF THE DRILL,

19:43.516 --> 19:46.284
       IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.518
           TAKE THIS.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.387
      LISTEN TO TRACK 17,

19:49.389 --> 19:50.821
       AND DON'T JUDGE ME
   FOR HAVING IT ON MY IPOD.

19:50.823 --> 19:54.225
    I THINK YOU'RE FALLING.
    - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, YEP.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.227
  YEAH, I JUST WAXED THE CAR.
           ALL RIGHT?

19:56.229 --> 19:57.295
          - OKAY, BYE.

20:00.966 --> 20:03.668
     - OH, BLOODY GOOD JOB!

20:03.670 --> 20:05.403
             OH...
             [thud]

20:06.738 --> 20:10.875
        [all screaming]

20:10.877 --> 20:12.610
    - WHY AREN'T WE LEAVING?

20:12.612 --> 20:14.946
   - LET'S JUST GIVE IT A FEW
 MINUTES, MAKE SURE HE'S GOOD.

20:14.948 --> 20:16.714
             - MM.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.418
   - LISTEN, YOU DIDN'T RUIN
       POKER NIGHT, OKAY?

20:20.420 --> 20:23.387
