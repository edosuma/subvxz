WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:06.566
Oh, no. Boardwalk with a hotel,
two thousand big ones, baby.

00:06.633 --> 00:08.933
You win, Obie, you win.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.566
Yes.

00:11.633 --> 00:14.066
Now, you just want me
for my fake money.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.533
‐ Hey, people.
‐ Hey.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.666
This is Kimberly.

00:18.733 --> 00:20.600
Kimberly, that's Overton
and that's Synclaire.

00:20.666 --> 00:21.633
‐ How do you do?
‐ Hi.

00:21.700 --> 00:23.000
Synclaire, can I talk to you
for a minute.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.366
Absolutely, come on.

00:24.433 --> 00:25.800
I'll be right back.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.100
So who's winning?

00:28.166 --> 00:31.200
Ah, well, I don't wanna brag,
but me.

00:32.732 --> 00:35.300
Kim and I have planned this
really romantic evening, right

00:35.366 --> 00:37.900
but the wine store
was out of my favorite Bordeaux.

00:37.966 --> 00:41.200
Now, isn't there a bottle
down here somewhere, huh?

00:41.266 --> 00:43.033
You mean, the one you gave
Khadijah for her birthday

00:43.100 --> 00:44.566
even though you know
she hates red wine?

00:44.633 --> 00:45.566
[chuckles]
That's the one.

00:45.633 --> 00:47.566
I have it right here.

00:49.733 --> 00:51.933
I like your shaved head.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.666
It makes you look like
the Pharaoh Ramses.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.566
Well, I did just
get a new head balm

00:58.633 --> 01:02.006
that brings out
the luster in my scalp.

01:04.473 --> 01:06.406
It looks so smooth.

01:08.006 --> 01:10.073
Nice.

01:10.140 --> 01:12.906
Yeah, well, I'm guessing
you get the idea.

01:15.206 --> 01:16.473
‐ Show yourself out.
‐ You ready, Kimberly?

01:16.540 --> 01:17.973
Oh, it was nice meeting you,
Synclaire.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.273
‐ 'Okay.'
‐ Overton.

01:20.340 --> 01:21.873
‐ Uh, Overton.
‐ Mm.

01:21.940 --> 01:25.840
If you finish your game before
I finish mine, play again.

01:25.906 --> 01:28.173
‐ Alright.
‐ Alright.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.906
‐ Bow‐wow.
‐ Watch dog.

01:30.973 --> 01:35.040
Uh, baby, does a‐a,
a‐a woman caressing

01:35.106 --> 01:37.906
a strange man's scalp
count as flirting?

01:39.940 --> 01:41.940
Did Kimberly feel your dome?

01:44.806 --> 01:46.306
Yeah‐huh.

01:46.373 --> 01:49.973
Yes, that head balm
I bought you really works.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.406
Says right on the package

01:51.473 --> 01:53.973

they will love to touch."

02:32.280 --> 02:34.813
She had the nerve
to leave a broken umbrella

02:34.880 --> 02:36.813
where I could steal it.

02:38.413 --> 02:39.746
She's out with John.

02:39.813 --> 02:42.213
Oh, the jellyfish from
the cosmetics company.

02:44.146 --> 02:46.046
No, I mean I liked it,
but I don't know

02:46.113 --> 02:47.480
why everyone's saying
it's the most

02:47.546 --> 02:49.780
original foreign film
of the year.

02:49.846 --> 02:52.146
Well, I'm saying,
you take it out at the woods

02:52.213 --> 02:54.646
lose that castle,
add some black people

02:54.713 --> 02:56.213
and it was "Boyz n the Hood."

02:58.880 --> 03:00.920
Hey, you guys,
you all remember John?

03:00.986 --> 03:01.953
‐ Hi.
‐ Hi.

03:02.020 --> 03:02.986
‐ Whatever.
‐ 'How are you doing?'

03:03.053 --> 03:04.753
I‐I'm gonna put your cappuccino

03:04.820 --> 03:06.320
in your favorite mug for you.

03:06.386 --> 03:07.386
You are so nice.

03:07.453 --> 03:09.386
No, you are so nice.

03:10.386 --> 03:12.320
I am so sick.

03:14.053 --> 03:15.353
You know what, you guys

03:15.420 --> 03:17.653
I have the best time
when I'm with John.

03:17.720 --> 03:21.586
I mean, he is cute, he is funny,
and we both enjoy mini series.

03:23.153 --> 03:25.953
Sounds like the total package.

03:26.020 --> 03:27.153
Backbone not included.

03:27.220 --> 03:29.120
[scoffs]

03:31.153 --> 03:33.786
Well, who do we have here?

03:33.853 --> 03:37.120
Madam jealousy and
her green eyed sidekick envy?

03:39.653 --> 03:43.853
‐ Here you go, Regine.
‐ Oh, thank you.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.786
‐ Mmm.
‐ Wh‐what's wrong?

03:45.853 --> 03:48.920
I‐isn't that hot enough?
Oh, I'll be right back.

03:52.086 --> 03:54.320
Damn, I wonder if they have
a support group

03:54.386 --> 03:55.953
for weak brothers like that.

03:56.020 --> 03:57.853
‐ Don't.
‐ Yeah.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.086
Once a month they plan
on getting together

04:00.153 --> 04:02.093
then their women tell 'em
they can't go.

04:03.860 --> 04:08.093
Well, look at this, little Dijah
joking about relationships.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.926
To think, girl,
you can remember that far back?

04:12.126 --> 04:16.360
Woo‐ooo, oh, let's roll
upstairs, Synclaire.

04:16.426 --> 04:17.593
I think a tornado is coming

04:17.660 --> 04:19.493
and this living room
is a trailer park.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.892
Let's go.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.526
‐ Thank you.
‐ Oh, oh, God!

04:25.593 --> 04:26.860
Good job, John.

04:26.926 --> 04:29.860
Regine, does he kick his foot
when you rub his belly?

04:31.993 --> 04:34.293
Shut up.

04:34.359 --> 04:36.159
Good one, Regine.

04:36.226 --> 04:37.593
You must've been
on the debate team

04:37.659 --> 04:39.559
when you were
in high school.

04:39.626 --> 04:41.393
Not unless they
needed a towel girl.

04:41.460 --> 04:43.760
[laughs]

04:43.826 --> 04:46.093
Go away.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.760
Touche again, Regine.

04:48.826 --> 04:50.926
You should have
your own talk show.

04:50.993 --> 04:54.993
This week on "Regine," Regine.

05:02.633 --> 05:05.000
‐ Oh, my gosh!
‐ Oh, my God.

05:05.066 --> 05:07.000
Hey, hey, John, John, John.

05:07.066 --> 05:08.900
See that laundry mat
over there

05:08.966 --> 05:12.466
that's where doormats of the
'90s do their girlfriends wash.

05:12.533 --> 05:14.366
Well, I wish Regine was here.

05:14.433 --> 05:16.366
She would have a zing off you.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.000
Oh, my good Lord.

05:20.066 --> 05:23.700
Ah, wooh, when is Regine gonna
get tired of that man

05:23.766 --> 05:25.533
catering to her every whim?

05:25.600 --> 05:28.300
Please, when he dies,
she's gonna be at his funeral

05:28.366 --> 05:30.166
yelling at him, telling him

05:30.233 --> 05:32.033
"How can you lie down like that

05:32.100 --> 05:34.100
when I don't have
a place to sit?"

05:37.433 --> 05:39.800
Oh, God, he must go.

05:39.866 --> 05:42.666
He's just gotta find somebody
nicer and cuter than Regine.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.933
Oh, give me a phonebook
and some darts.

05:48.133 --> 05:49.666
Hey, you know what?

05:49.733 --> 05:51.533
You know we could always
send him a Dear John letter

05:51.600 --> 05:54.233
and sign Regine's name to it.

05:54.300 --> 05:59.600
Here it is, "Dear John, I cannot
go on with this charade.

05:59.666 --> 06:02.673
"I am not ready
for a committed relationship

06:02.740 --> 06:04.640
"and I must end
things now before

06:04.706 --> 06:06.773
I fall deeply
in love with you. I.."

06:06.840 --> 06:10.273
"I‐I, I beg of you
to forget all about me..

06:12.740 --> 06:15.540
...and stay the hell away
from my apartment."

06:15.606 --> 06:17.640
"And don't call me!"

06:17.706 --> 06:23.573
"And if I call you, be strong
and tell me it's over."

06:23.640 --> 06:27.906
"And release me
like a thousand doves!"

06:28.840 --> 06:31.206
[laughs]
What the devil?

06:31.273 --> 06:34.573
Ah, I have a poetic side.
I always do.

06:34.640 --> 06:35.973
Hi, ladies.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.340
Regine said we have
to get her a cooler.

06:38.406 --> 06:40.840
She wants to chill some
champagne in her room.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.106
Oh.

06:45.540 --> 06:48.706
Y'all can keep the ice.
Regine prefers the round cubes.

06:56.340 --> 06:58.873
Oh, uh, hey, Kimberly, um..

06:58.940 --> 07:00.913
...Kyle won't be back
for another hour or so

07:00.980 --> 07:02.613
but, uh, you know,
I'll be happy to tell him

07:02.680 --> 07:03.880
that you were here, alright?

07:03.946 --> 07:05.213
Now, bye.

07:07.813 --> 07:09.413
I'll wait.

07:14.513 --> 07:16.713
‐ What are you doing?
‐ Enjoying the view.

07:16.780 --> 07:17.946
Oh!

07:19.346 --> 07:22.313
Uh, look here, well, uh,
I'm really flattered

07:22.380 --> 07:25.013
but you know
I got a girlfriend.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.480
Girlfriend, boyfriend,
they're just labels.

07:29.313 --> 07:31.680
Um, well,
I find labels quite handy.

07:31.746 --> 07:34.580
You know, like, uh..

07:34.646 --> 07:39.213
...do not iron, uh,
do not remove, uh..

07:39.280 --> 07:42.046
...do not stab roommate
in the back.

07:44.680 --> 07:47.680
Well, if you change your mind,
I'll be around.

07:49.580 --> 07:50.980
Hi, Kimberly. Hi, Obie.

07:51.046 --> 07:52.113
‐ Hi.
‐ Hey.

07:52.180 --> 07:55.013
Well, Overton,
tell Kyle I stopped by.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.380
Hey, shnicky‐yukums.

07:58.780 --> 08:00.853
That girl just
made a pass at me.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.053
‐ What?
‐ Yeah!

08:02.120 --> 08:03.386
She was standing
behind me telling me

08:03.453 --> 08:05.753
she was enjoying the view,
and I wasn't wearing

08:05.820 --> 08:09.586
my picturesque Grand Canyon
two belt, so..

08:09.653 --> 08:13.353
Okay, I bet a little slap boxing
will stop her sightseeing.

08:13.420 --> 08:16.120
‐ Hey, now. Come here.
‐ How could.. Unh‐unh..

08:16.186 --> 08:19.753
Come on, come on. Violence is
not gonna solve anything, girl.

08:19.820 --> 08:21.120
Oh, I see.

08:21.186 --> 08:24.253
Some heifer comes in here
looking at your butt..

08:24.320 --> 08:26.253
...and suddenly you're Gandhi.

08:30.320 --> 08:33.385
Just, just calm down.
Look, I'll tell Kyle.

08:33.453 --> 08:34.553
He will kick it to the curve

08:34.620 --> 08:37.086
we'll never see her again,
alright?

08:37.153 --> 08:39.186
Alright, Obie,
we'll do it your way.

08:39.253 --> 08:42.553
But that little heifer don't
know who's she messing with.

08:42.620 --> 08:44.886
I'm from Minnesota, yo.

08:49.253 --> 08:52.186
Man, where is John? The party
started 15 minutes ago.

08:53.553 --> 08:55.286
Hey, John.

08:55.353 --> 08:57.120
Yeah, I thought
you were gonna pick me up..

08:58.653 --> 08:59.993
What?

09:01.393 --> 09:03.026
‐ Hello.
‐ 'Um?'

09:05.226 --> 09:06.660
Hello.

09:08.193 --> 09:09.793
What happened?

09:10.926 --> 09:13.026
He said he can't see me anymore.

09:13.093 --> 09:15.193
Oh, no!

09:17.860 --> 09:19.426
I mean, that was so weird,
you know

09:19.493 --> 09:21.760
he‐he said something
about releasing me

09:21.826 --> 09:24.126
like a thousand doves.

09:34.326 --> 09:38.593
[chuckles]
I, I cannot believe that
John just broke up with me.

09:38.660 --> 09:40.460
(Synclaire)
'Oh, girl.'

09:42.360 --> 09:45.693
Well, maybe he's not himself.

09:45.760 --> 09:49.926
I mean, that whole release me
like a thousand doves thing..

09:49.993 --> 09:51.460
...that is just crazy!

09:52.960 --> 09:54.193
I'm in shock here.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.860
It's just, see with John,
it wasn't just dating.

09:57.926 --> 10:00.633
Y‐you know, I mean, we,
we had a real friendship.

10:02.266 --> 10:04.733
Is it me?

10:04.800 --> 10:07.000
Could I be high maintenance?

10:08.766 --> 10:13.733
[sighs]
Oh, my God, I‐I‐I gotta go, and,
and curl up in my ruffler

10:13.800 --> 10:16.666
and comforter
and slip on my satin eyeshades.

10:18.766 --> 10:21.300
Max, what the hell did you do?

10:23.033 --> 10:25.333
I, okay, I'm not sure.
Alright, okay, listen.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.533
I‐I just wanted to see
what the "Dear John" letter

10:27.600 --> 10:29.466
would like on paper, alright?

10:29.533 --> 10:31.433
And then I wanted to see
what they would like

10:31.500 --> 10:32.866
over a forgery
of writing signature

10:32.933 --> 10:34.233
and then I guess I wanted to see
what it looked like

10:34.300 --> 10:36.866
going to a mailbox, and
it's not as if, it's not as if

10:36.933 --> 10:39.333
Khadija didn't
have anything to do with this.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.600
‐ Don't you put this on me.
‐ Oh, no, no, no.

10:41.666 --> 10:42.800
You're the one that said

10:42.866 --> 10:45.000
John should tell her
it's over if she called.

10:45.066 --> 10:46.600
That's what made it sing.

10:48.800 --> 10:49.966
That was pretty good.

10:50.033 --> 10:52.966
Oh, I can't believe you two.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.600
I mean, sure,
some relationship should end

10:57.666 --> 11:00.506
like when someone you knows
boyfriend's being hit on

11:00.573 --> 11:02.940
by his roommate's girlfriend,
sure!

11:04.773 --> 11:07.673
But Regine and John
really liked each other.

11:09.173 --> 11:11.406
Look, Max, if you don't tell
Regine, I will.

11:11.473 --> 11:13.673
Oh, come on.
Regine's upset enough.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.473
She'll be devastated
if she found out

11:15.540 --> 11:19.140
that we are...responsible.

11:19.206 --> 11:23.206
Now, just listen, at least
tell John it was a joke.

11:23.273 --> 11:26.106
Maybe he will forgive you
and get back with Regine.

11:26.173 --> 11:28.573
Synclaire, we maliciously
destroyed a relationship

11:28.640 --> 11:30.173
that meant everything to him.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.706
He would have to be
a pretty pathetic slug

11:31.773 --> 11:33.473
to forgive us for that.

11:35.806 --> 11:37.740
‐ Let's do this.
‐ Alright, let's go.

11:42.506 --> 11:44.140
What's up, brother?

11:44.206 --> 11:47.073
Hey, Kyle, uh, can I talk
to you for a minute?

11:47.140 --> 11:49.173
‐ It's kinda important.
‐ What?

11:49.240 --> 11:51.773
Uh, your girl, Kimberly,
made a pass at me

11:51.840 --> 11:53.273
and I wanted to let you know

11:53.340 --> 11:56.040
so you can give her
the ol' heave‐ho, so to speak.

11:56.106 --> 11:58.073
[chuckles]
Come on, man,
clearly you must've

11:58.140 --> 11:59.573
misunderstood something
she said.

11:59.640 --> 12:02.713
Na, no mistake knowing
a girl looked at me.

12:02.780 --> 12:04.913
She looked at me like
I was a big glass of water

12:04.980 --> 12:07.980
and let me tell you she was
thirsty for a cool sip of Obie.

12:10.046 --> 12:14.613
Um...no offense, Obie,
but when you have fillet mignon

12:14.680 --> 12:16.213
on your plate,
you do not reach over

12:16.280 --> 12:18.513
and grab a chicken wing
off the next table.

12:21.113 --> 12:24.713
Yeah, but if the fillet
is a little overdone..

12:27.046 --> 12:30.980
...and, uh, pretty fired
with all kind of fancy sauces

12:31.046 --> 12:33.546
ah, them chicken wings start
looking mighty tasty

12:33.613 --> 12:35.146
now, don't they?

12:36.680 --> 12:39.313
You know, Overton,
you are absolutely right.

12:39.380 --> 12:41.680
I mean, clearly,
Kimberly could not help herself.

12:41.746 --> 12:46.213
Look at you.
You are a walking aphrodisiac.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.580
I am surprised you are not
covered with bruises

12:48.646 --> 12:51.680
from all the women who have
thrown themselves at you.

12:53.580 --> 12:56.213
Now, if you will excuse me,
I must go upstairs

12:56.280 --> 12:57.746
and strap down all
the furniture before

12:57.813 --> 13:00.520
the Earth shifts on its axis
from all the hordes of females

13:00.586 --> 13:03.786
rushing to this hemisphere
just to be nearer to you.

13:05.486 --> 13:06.453
Alright, laugh it up.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.686
Let me see how clever you are

13:07.753 --> 13:10.086
when you catch
your woman admiring my ass.

13:11.686 --> 13:13.753
[laughing]

13:17.153 --> 13:18.586
[knock on door]

13:22.986 --> 13:27.620
Khadija, Max.
Friends of Regine, come on in.

13:27.686 --> 13:28.653
Can I get you anything?

13:28.720 --> 13:30.186
I, I've got a pot roast
in the freezer

13:30.253 --> 13:32.286
I can thaw it out
in a couple of hours.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.153
No, we'll never be here
that long.

13:34.220 --> 13:36.120
What.. Slow down there,
Khadijah, I mean..

13:36.186 --> 13:38.286
[chuckles]
We're talking about
someone's emotions here.

13:38.353 --> 13:40.520
Do you do those little
oven roasted potatoes?

13:42.186 --> 13:43.986
What, uh,
what brings you guys here?

13:44.053 --> 13:45.686
Did Regine change her mind?

13:45.753 --> 13:48.653
No, Regine doesn't even
know we are here.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.686
She also doesn't know about
that letter you got.

13:51.753 --> 13:53.053
W‐what do you mean?

13:53.120 --> 13:54.420
‐ Well, we‐‐
‐ You.

13:54.486 --> 13:59.786
One of us‐s‐s...wrote
that letter as a joke

13:59.853 --> 14:02.660
and signed Regine's name to it.

14:02.726 --> 14:04.860
"Our future will be
world's apart..

14:04.926 --> 14:06.893
"We must go our separate ways..

14:06.960 --> 14:09.260
Release me like a 1000 doves."

14:09.326 --> 14:12.460
Poetry by Maxine Angelou.
Thank you very much.

14:14.393 --> 14:16.926
You‐you couldn't have written
that letter.

14:16.993 --> 14:20.460
Only Regine's words
could kill me so softly.

14:22.493 --> 14:24.526
Okay, I guess
I gotta tell you the truth.

14:25.860 --> 14:28.660
Max broke you two up

14:28.726 --> 14:30.993
because she wanted you
for herself.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.293
Please.

14:36.360 --> 14:39.060
Look, look, alright, I did write
that letter, alright, I did.

14:39.126 --> 14:41.226
I wrote that letter.
You wanna know why?

14:41.293 --> 14:44.160
Because I was tired of watching
Regine step all over you.

14:44.226 --> 14:47.026
Come on, man, stand up
for yourself. Be a man.

14:47.093 --> 14:50.026
Grow up that ball.
Get up in there. Go for yours.

14:50.093 --> 14:51.993
Come on.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.526
Well, I‐I‐I guess you're right.

14:56.593 --> 14:59.493
You know, I‐I've always had a
hard time standing up for myself

14:59.560 --> 15:01.266
e‐e‐especially for women.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.733
Look, John,
I know it may seem like

15:03.800 --> 15:06.266
Regine wants
you to be her Mr. Belvedere

15:06.333 --> 15:09.066
but she would be
much better off with a man

15:09.133 --> 15:11.033
who could just stand
his ground, you know.

15:12.966 --> 15:15.866
Well, I‐I‐I can stand my ground.

15:15.933 --> 15:18.533
I mean,
if that's what she wants.

15:18.600 --> 15:22.900
But y‐y‐y‐you are asking me
to change my entire personality

15:22.966 --> 15:26.066
and that's gonna take
at least an hour and a half?

15:33.500 --> 15:36.400
I love this time of year.

15:36.466 --> 15:38.200
Winter is over,
but there is still

15:38.266 --> 15:41.033
that refreshing snap in the air.

15:41.100 --> 15:42.733
You're right, I'm freezing.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.233
Me too.

15:45.300 --> 15:48.866
You know, in some cultures,
sharing a blanket

15:48.933 --> 15:50.633
constitutes marriage.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.000
Oh.

15:54.633 --> 15:57.100
Oh, hey, it's raining, let's go.

15:57.166 --> 15:58.833
Oh, look.

15:58.900 --> 16:02.106
Well, if it isn't Kyle
and everybody's friend.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.773
Am I missing something?

16:06.840 --> 16:11.106
For some inane reason, Overton
thinks you made a pass at him.

16:11.173 --> 16:12.706
I was simply
letting Overton know

16:12.773 --> 16:16.873
that I think he is a
very...very sexy man.

16:25.673 --> 16:27.540
[laughing]

16:30.306 --> 16:32.006
Give my blanket.

16:36.006 --> 16:38.506
Look, Overton is my roommate.

16:38.573 --> 16:41.273
What the hell were you thinking?

16:41.340 --> 16:44.573
I am not the kind of person
who holds back her feelings.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.506
I think people should just do
what makes them happy.

16:49.273 --> 16:51.873
Okay,
and you are absolutely right

16:51.940 --> 16:53.906
and nothing would make me
happier right now

16:53.973 --> 16:58.173
then watching you walk right
down those stairs. Goodbye.

17:05.380 --> 17:07.445
Kyle, I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

17:07.512 --> 17:09.180
[laughs]

17:11.012 --> 17:14.346
And I want you to know I think
you're a very special man.

17:14.413 --> 17:15.680
[sighs]

17:18.380 --> 17:20.945
‐ You too.
‐ Oh, no, you didn't.

17:21.012 --> 17:23.613
O‐o‐out! Get out! Time to go.

17:25.680 --> 17:28.113
Hey, where is Regine? John is
gonna be here any minute.

17:28.180 --> 17:30.113
You know
how Regine cheers herself up.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.913
She probably rented
a horse drawn carriage

17:31.980 --> 17:33.113
and is riding around
Central Park

17:33.180 --> 17:34.980
pretending she is royalty.

17:38.380 --> 17:41.313
Hey, you two,
uh, this is Keith.

17:43.180 --> 17:44.746
‐ Keith, that's Khadija.
‐ 'How you doin'?'

17:44.813 --> 17:48.480
‐ And this is Max.
‐ Hi, nice to meet you.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.380
Hi.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.046
Who the hell is this?

17:55.380 --> 17:57.013
‐ Have a seat.
‐ Thanks.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.046
Well, girls,
I went down to the studio

17:59.113 --> 18:01.120
to take my mind off things,
you know

18:01.186 --> 18:02.853
and, uh, Keith was there.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.820
See, he has been
painting a mural in the lobby

18:04.886 --> 18:06.053
for the last three weeks.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.886
Yeah, but I was captivated
by Regine's smile

18:08.953 --> 18:10.220
'and I was very
impressed by the fact'

18:10.286 --> 18:12.386
that she realized
that the black splatters

18:12.453 --> 18:14.120
on my mural represented death.

18:14.186 --> 18:16.253
Well, they were too big
to be crows.

18:17.686 --> 18:20.420
‐ Excuse us.
‐ Excuse me.

18:20.486 --> 18:22.086
‐ Pardon me.
‐ Sure.

18:22.153 --> 18:24.420
Yeah.. Excuse me, excuse me.
Here, oh, look.

18:24.486 --> 18:26.253
Hey, take this, young feller.
Ha ha ha.

18:26.320 --> 18:29.220
Look, um, you know, lean forward
because the batteries are weak.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.520
Alright, Regine, what's up?

18:33.586 --> 18:37.253
Isn't Keith something?
I mean, he is handsome.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.320
He is cool, he's, he is kind,
he is strong

18:39.386 --> 18:42.086
and his painting sell
for quite a bit of money

18:42.153 --> 18:44.553
and he ain't even dead yet.

18:44.620 --> 18:45.986
Well, forget Keith.

18:46.053 --> 18:48.986
We talked to John, and he
realizes he made a mistake.

18:50.286 --> 18:51.253
You guys did that for me?

18:51.320 --> 18:53.086
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yes.

18:53.153 --> 18:54.686
Well, that is really sweet

18:54.753 --> 18:57.853
but I don't think
that John is good for me.

18:57.920 --> 19:01.193
You know, I mean, he already
does everything that I ask.

19:01.260 --> 19:03.193
So there is really no room
for the relationship to grow

19:03.260 --> 19:04.693
now is there?

19:07.593 --> 19:11.593
See...had we just let
well enough alone

19:11.660 --> 19:13.593
we'd be home free right now.

19:13.660 --> 19:15.860
Hey, we got to stop
John before he gets here.

19:15.926 --> 19:17.393
Please, Khadija,
it's no big deal.

19:17.460 --> 19:18.393
[doorbell rings]

19:18.460 --> 19:19.826
Alright, girl,
give me a call, alright.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.560
Don't even try. Come on.

19:21.626 --> 19:23.860
I‐I'll get it, I'll get it.

19:23.926 --> 19:25.360
I got it. I got it.

19:28.560 --> 19:29.726
‐ Hey, can I talk..
‐ Alright, brother, we need to..

19:29.793 --> 19:32.593
Step aside, ladies. Step aside.

19:32.660 --> 19:33.793
John, um, this‐‐

19:33.860 --> 19:37.326
Regine, I'm just going
to come right out and say it.

19:37.393 --> 19:39.593
It's time for me to move on

19:39.660 --> 19:43.126
and, uh, I'm sure
you'll find someone eventually.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.026
Gee, John, I hope you're right.

19:47.093 --> 19:49.293
Um, Regine, if we are gonna
make this movie

19:49.360 --> 19:50.293
we should get going.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.826
Uh, okay.

19:54.126 --> 19:57.660
Oh, I see. It's like that.

19:57.726 --> 20:02.100
La Viva, enjoy your
little movie. I don't need you.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.966
I'm gonna be alright.

20:05.933 --> 20:08.666
You come with some baggage,
don't you?

20:10.833 --> 20:15.100
Well, you have really
showed me something today.

20:15.166 --> 20:17.700
There is more than one way
to be disturbed.

20:19.833 --> 20:22.066
I‐I finally stood up for myself

20:22.133 --> 20:24.366
and‐and it wasn't as hard
as I thought.

20:24.433 --> 20:27.100
Matter of fact,
it gave me a little buzz.

20:27.166 --> 20:28.200
Come on, Max, let's go.

20:28.266 --> 20:30.766
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

20:30.833 --> 20:32.166
Don't worry, it's okay.

20:32.233 --> 20:35.366
I just want you to know
I feel the same about you

20:35.433 --> 20:38.233
as you do about me.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.200
Then the thought of me
touching you is making

20:40.266 --> 20:43.066
you wanna throw up,
get the..

20:43.133 --> 20:47.133
Now see, the old John would have
taken that as objection

20:47.200 --> 20:51.933
but you have given me strength,
and you will reap the reward.

20:54.266 --> 20:56.100
I don't want to reap.

20:58.666 --> 21:02.973
Okay, okay, you need time,
take all the time you like.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.773
I'll pick you up
at 8 o'clock tomorrow night.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.540
I won't be here.

21:06.606 --> 21:08.806
Well, then I'll come back
when you are

21:08.873 --> 21:12.273
because our love is stronger
than the both of us.

21:18.306 --> 21:22.140
So, um, when you and your man
having us over for pot roast?

21:24.873 --> 21:26.240
<i>(Synclaire)</i>
<i>We will be right back.</i>

21:30.519 --> 21:32.853
(John)
'Ooh, let's see,
we got, uh, pot roast'

21:32.919 --> 21:36.053
little oven roasted potatoes,
broccoli, and a..

21:36.119 --> 21:39.653
[sniffs]
Zesty cheese sauce.

21:39.719 --> 21:42.219
Garlic bread,
of course with toss salad

21:42.286 --> 21:44.353
'and an assortment of olives.'

21:44.419 --> 21:47.553
This is quite a feast. Mmm.

21:47.619 --> 21:50.786
Well, cooking makes me happy

21:50.853 --> 21:53.419
and I believe people should do
what makes them happy.

21:53.486 --> 21:56.086
Oh, I couldn't agree more

21:56.153 --> 22:00.159
but, uh, what are we gonna
do with all this extra food?

22:01.993 --> 22:03.926
Oh, I did cook
a little too much.

22:05.493 --> 22:07.659
Is your roommate
gonna be home soon?

22:09.926 --> 22:10.859
<i>(Regine)</i>
<i>Woo‐hoo!</i>

22:10.926 --> 22:12.459
<i>[Regine chuckles]</i>
