So, playing with
this year's concept,

00:42.143 --> 00:43.542
"The Light of Christmas,"

00:43.577 --> 00:49.181
I went from day to night,
light to dark, ending here.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.583
Or, alternatively, we could
reverse the order.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.652
Start here, and then
move towards the...

00:53.687 --> 00:55.154
The order doesn't matter.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.122
I like what you've captured.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.424
You do?

00:58.459 --> 01:00.893
The architectural aspect
is super high-concept,

01:00.928 --> 01:02.694
and well, your point of view
as a photographer

01:02.730 --> 01:04.063
has always been unique.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.764
That's why we've hired you,
for, what...

01:05.800 --> 01:07.666
Six assignments, so far.

01:07.735 --> 01:08.934
But this?

01:08.969 --> 01:12.237
This is the magazine insert
for Christmas Day.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.373
It's not only a great
portfolio piece,

01:14.442 --> 01:17.309
it's also, as you know, a chance
to join our staff.

01:17.378 --> 01:18.510
I know.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.079
I know. I can't believe
an opening came up.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.380
And since it showed up
over the holidays,

01:21.415 --> 01:22.881
we thought, why not offer it
to the photographer

01:22.950 --> 01:24.983
who lands the Christmas spread?

01:25.019 --> 01:26.318
I love that.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.854
And I'm very grateful to be
in the running.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.957
Look, I'm a fan of these,
uh, I am, but...

01:31.992 --> 01:33.759
Is that a maybe?

01:33.794 --> 01:35.894
We'll see what the chief says.

01:35.930 --> 01:36.929
Thank you.

Oh.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.968
you'll absolutely get
our volume discount.

01:43.003 --> 01:43.802
Okay, great.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.270
I'll send our rates over now.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.573
Merry Christmas.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.275
Please tell me he said yes.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.677
He said it's up to the chief.

How's that?

01:52.613 --> 01:53.645
That's great!

Yeah.

to get too excited just yet.

You're the hardest worker
I know.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.096
You're gonna land this spread,
and the position.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.065
Just, is it what you want?

02:13.100 --> 02:15.000
It's a lot of 9:00 to 5:00.

02:16.971 --> 02:20.739
Yeah, I wish I could say I was
cut out for the hustle, but...

02:20.774 --> 02:22.875
9:00 to 5:00 sounds pretty good
right about now.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.109
You know?

02:24.145 --> 02:25.611
Maybe it would be good
to change up the pace.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.246
Hey, it might even give you
some time to go on that date

02:27.281 --> 02:29.615

02:29.683 --> 02:31.850

Uh, I don't know.

02:52.206 --> 02:54.740

going there.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.708
And how long's it been?

02:56.744 --> 02:57.910
Thirteen years.

memories there.

10:29.730 --> 10:30.362
Will do.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.196
Okay.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.130
All right, good to see ya.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.498
You too.

10:33.567 --> 10:36.868
Uh, I'll see you guys
all at the wedding.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.637
Hey.

10:38.672 --> 10:39.404
Good to see you.

10:39.473 --> 10:40.939
Yeah, you too.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.875
I mean, except for the near
collision outside, but...

10:43.910 --> 10:45.377
Yeah, well, hey.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.444
You never were a very
good driver.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.846
Hey.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.782
I was learning, and I was being
responsibly cautious.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.117
Oh, yeah.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.586
15 miles an hour, rocking out
to Sarah McLachlan?

10:54.621 --> 10:56.187
You can't speed to Sarah.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.022
Nah?

10:57.057 --> 10:59.457
Okay.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.426
Well, I know you're going to be
busy this week,

11:01.461 --> 11:04.396
but if you need a Christmas
in the Cape tour guide,

11:04.431 --> 11:05.697
let me know.

11:05.732 --> 11:07.866
Oh, thanks. Yeah.

11:07.934 --> 11:10.135
But you're gonna be busy
with your family and your wife,

11:10.170 --> 11:11.436
and all that.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.172
I'm, uh, yeah, I'm not
married anymore.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.540
What?

11:15.609 --> 11:17.609
I guess I... I figured
you woulda heard.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.611
No...no, I didn't...
I didn't hear that.

11:19.646 --> 11:20.445
I'm so sorry.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.513
It's all good.

11:21.548 --> 11:22.881
Really is.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.684
And, I wanted to say
I'm sorry too.

11:25.752 --> 11:27.318
Oh, for what?

11:27.387 --> 11:28.887
That summer.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.689
Your mom got sick.

11:30.724 --> 11:31.556
I really meant to...

11:31.591 --> 11:32.657
[shortly] Thank you.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.926
But we don't need
to talk about that.

11:34.961 --> 11:35.627
Okay.

11:35.662 --> 11:37.429
'Kay.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.463
Merry Christmas.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.365
Merry Christmas.

11:48.542 --> 11:49.541
It took four people-

11:49.576 --> 11:50.208
Four-

11:50.243 --> 11:51.142
to get the tree in.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.977
Okay, how big is your tree?

11:53.013 --> 11:56.114
And, we actually had
to cut a foot of it off

11:56.183 --> 11:57.515
to even get it in.

11:57.551 --> 11:58.983
[laughs]

11:59.019 --> 12:00.452
I've always been a sucker
for the most ridiculously large

12:00.487 --> 12:01.953
Christmas trees.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.321
And holiday weddings.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.856
Well, okay, I will admit it.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.257
I'm a little Christmas crazy.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.059
It's a Christmas Eve wedding.

12:08.128 --> 12:08.660
Mm-hmm.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.361
Exactly.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.231
With our closest friends
and family.

12:13.266 --> 12:16.334
It's just my absolute
favourite time of the year.

12:16.369 --> 12:20.305
It always makes me feel like
I'm part of something bigger.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.541
So, it's an unconventional day
for a wedding, but...

12:23.577 --> 12:26.344
But perfect for us.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.347
It is.

12:29.416 --> 12:35.286
And finding this love now is
my own Christmas miracle.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.489
Mine too.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.725
[clears throat]

12:40.761 --> 12:41.826
Well, I got that
tree decorated,

12:41.862 --> 12:43.461
and I'd love for you
to come see it.

12:43.497 --> 12:44.629
So, do you want to come
by the house,

12:44.664 --> 12:46.131
and we can make some cookies,

12:46.166 --> 12:48.266
or finish making the chocolate
moulds for the wedding favours?

12:48.301 --> 12:49.434
Yeah, but not tomorrow.

12:49.469 --> 12:50.502
Oh, no.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.036
Oh, why, what's tomorrow?

12:52.072 --> 12:54.172
We're going to get
your Christmas tree.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.274
We wanted you here
to get the tree.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.743
Oh, yeah.

12:58.779 --> 13:01.513
And we have to swing by the
hotel and finish some details

13:01.548 --> 13:04.149
with the wedding coordinator.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.050
You don't have to go if you
think it's gonna be boring.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.385
I mean, you could always check
out the town.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.154
It's a lot different
at Christmas

13:09.189 --> 13:10.121
than what you're used to.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.656
Thank you.

13:11.691 --> 13:13.391
Well, I have some very special
Christmas bark

13:13.426 --> 13:15.260
that I'd like to share.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.561
May I interest you?

13:16.596 --> 13:17.262
Ahh, Christmas bark.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.296
Yes.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.230
I'm gonna need some
extra energy,

13:19.299 --> 13:20.465
'cause I'm walking you home.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.733
Oh, like you need an excuse.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.535

13:23.570 --> 13:24.068

13:58.905 --> 14:02.040

we ever put up.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.943
It's a good one.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.277
Yeah.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.080
She was really talented,
wasn't she?

14:09.115 --> 14:14.285
Well, like I always say,
you guys are a lot alike.

14:14.321 --> 14:19.190
Oh... You still wear
your mom's necklace.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.025
What is it she always
used to say?

14:21.061 --> 14:22.493
Um...

14:22.529 --> 14:25.964
"Look up at the stars and..."

14:26.032 --> 14:27.732
"Know that I'll always
be there."

14:27.767 --> 14:30.335
Yeah.

14:30.370 --> 14:34.906
I never take it off.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.107

14:36.176 --> 14:38.042

14:38.078 --> 14:41.746
You know, I just wanna
thank you.

14:41.781 --> 14:44.582
You know, for all your support
with this.

14:44.618 --> 14:45.850
Means a lot to me.

14:45.886 --> 14:49.287
Oh, Dad. I just want you
to be happy.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.389
You know that.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.158
And I really like Helen.

14:54.194 --> 14:58.596
I'm excited for you to get
to know her better.

14:58.632 --> 15:03.835
I know it's only been 10 months,
but once we move in together.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.170
Is that what you and Mike
were talking about earlier,

15:06.206 --> 15:08.640
about what to do
with the house?

15:08.675 --> 15:11.175
Well, they just kinda need
to know if,

15:11.211 --> 15:14.045
uh, I'm gonna continue
to rent

15:14.080 --> 15:19.884
after I move in with Helen,
or... sell.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.052
Is that what you wanna do?

15:21.087 --> 15:24.188
Do you... do you wanna sell it?

15:24.224 --> 15:28.059
Well, I think it's something we
both need to decide, right?

15:28.094 --> 15:29.360
I don't think so.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.261
I mean, I haven't been here
in so many years.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.062
I don't...

15:31.097 --> 15:32.397
Hey. Hey. You know what?

15:32.465 --> 15:34.799
We... we don't have to talk
about this right now.

15:34.834 --> 15:38.069
We have lots of time.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.570

16:24.050 --> 16:25.216

to call you,

16:25.285 --> 16:26.217

17:03.823 --> 17:06.190
she wants to give someone
a gift on Christmas.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.993
So, that's when we'll reveal
which one of you we select.

we're good to go.

Awkward, but light.

every night by myself?

your superhuman strength.

an ice cream shop?

33:22.234 --> 33:23.500
Too cold.

33:23.535 --> 33:25.335
Yeah.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.137

small sometimes, too.

let's go.

34:31.136 --> 34:33.036

34:33.072 --> 34:36.940
Um... Does your ex-wife
still live here?

34:36.975 --> 34:38.141
No.

34:38.177 --> 34:41.044
No. She moved back to Ohio
after the divorce.

34:41.080 --> 34:44.147
It's all good, in the grand
scheme of things.

34:44.183 --> 34:46.516
Wow, you always do that,
don't you?

kinda guy.

No, no, no.

34:56.295 --> 34:57.127
Look, it's fine.

34:57.162 --> 34:59.563
We were young,
you know?

34:59.598 --> 35:02.232
We grew apart,
wanted different things.

35:02.301 --> 35:06.069
I tried to adapt,
make her happy, but...

35:06.105 --> 35:08.872
end of the day, it just didn't
fix anything.

35:08.907 --> 35:10.841
Yeah, I just wish I had seen
it coming.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.375
Oh, you know what, you can't do
that to yourself.

35:12.444 --> 35:16.847
It's easy to get wrapped up.

35:16.882 --> 35:19.049

35:19.084 --> 35:20.550
Wrapped up in a relationship?

35:20.619 --> 35:21.284
Yeah.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.652
I've never done that.

35:22.688 --> 35:23.487
Really?

35:23.555 --> 35:26.389
Mm.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.224
Oh, okay.

35:27.259 --> 35:27.757
Yeah. You're messing with me.

35:27.826 --> 35:28.458
Yeah.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.093
All right, so when?

35:30.129 --> 35:32.395
A few years back.

35:32.431 --> 35:33.897
I thought he was the one.

35:33.932 --> 35:36.533
We both did.

35:36.568 --> 35:41.004
Um, which is why he turned down
a job in LA.

35:41.073 --> 35:43.073
Eventually the guilt just
kinda started chipping away

35:43.108 --> 35:45.108
at the relationship until there
was nothing left,

35:45.177 --> 35:49.012
and suddenly he wasn't
in my life anymore.

35:49.081 --> 35:50.947
I'm sorry.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.949
And after him?

35:53.018 --> 35:55.051
Hasn't really felt
worth it since.

35:55.087 --> 35:57.654
Any of your relationships?

35:57.689 --> 35:59.322
No, yeah, no, I mean...

35:59.391 --> 36:04.828
Just, taking the chance
in the first place.

36:04.863 --> 36:10.267
I'm kind of done with loss,
so...

36:10.302 --> 36:13.637
I know it's hard but I think
it's worth it, every time.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.305
Yeah.

that one kiss we had,

36:36.195 --> 36:38.528
had happened at the beginning
of the summer

36:38.564 --> 36:40.363

36:49.041 --> 36:50.674

I guess we both thought we had
the next summer.

36:55.347 --> 36:59.115
Yeah, we did.

36:59.151 --> 37:02.852
But, hey, if any of that was
different, then...

37:02.888 --> 37:05.755
maybe we wouldn't be here.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.924
Maybe you wouldn't be eyeing
that job in London,

41:59.117 --> 42:00.450
Aww.

42:00.485 --> 42:04.120
Oh, well, good thing there are
a lot of them out here.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.755
Do you remember how many hours
you used to spend out here,

42:05.824 --> 42:08.324
playing by the creek?

42:08.360 --> 42:09.859
Yeah, and in it.

find it surprising

42:15.400 --> 42:17.634
how beautiful it is
here in the winter?

42:17.669 --> 42:18.868
No, of course not.

42:18.904 --> 42:20.870
You haven't had a chance
to experience it before.

42:20.906 --> 42:22.705
But it's special
all year around,

42:22.741 --> 42:28.611
now that I'm retired I get a
chance to enjoy it all the time.

42:28.647 --> 42:31.281

here for Christmas?

42:31.349 --> 42:32.048

42:32.083 --> 42:32.649
What?

42:32.684 --> 42:33.816
You did. Yeah.

42:33.852 --> 42:34.884

you don't remember?

42:36.187 --> 42:37.654
Yeah.

42:37.722 --> 42:41.090

before the furnace went out.

42:41.159 --> 42:41.991
What?

42:42.027 --> 42:43.192
Yeah.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.628
We didn't have a rental,
uh, company back then,

42:45.664 --> 42:47.864
so no one was available
to fix it.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.866
So, we just camped out
by the fireplace.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.067
We camped?

42:51.136 --> 42:52.168
Yup.

42:52.203 --> 42:53.670
Three nights,
right beside the tree.

42:53.705 --> 42:55.338

only in the summer after that.

going to be to come back,

43:17.529 --> 43:19.028
but, um...

43:19.064 --> 43:21.564
Me too.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.099
And I know that we still have
to talk about what to do

43:23.134 --> 43:24.400

43:24.436 --> 43:26.369
We can do that later.

43:28.006 --> 43:29.172

in your assignment,

on the tree.

53:40.785 --> 53:43.485

your mother.

53:43.521 --> 53:47.289
I mean, she sounds like such
an amazing woman.

53:47.325 --> 53:49.925
And I'll never try
to take her place,

53:49.961 --> 53:53.529
or what you guys had.

53:53.598 --> 53:56.098

how lucky I feel

53:56.133 --> 53:58.601
to be marrying into this family.

53:58.669 --> 54:06.108
So, I'm just hoping that maybe
you'll be my maid of honour.

54:06.143 --> 54:07.610

There's nothing extra you have
to do, I promise.

dresses aside, just in case.

opportunity, and a...

54:47.451 --> 54:49.785

up for.

54:49.820 --> 54:50.853

from you.

Well, you've always
been decisive.

out what it is holding you back,

good pictures of Santa today.

You know, the whole thing
was just amazing.

when you share it

moving, so...

Yeah, but he's here now.

56:00.458 --> 56:03.192
Yeah, but you know?

You know what, I think
it's just... our timing
was always off.

56:07.898 --> 56:12.701
When we were kids,
and then again now.

56:12.737 --> 56:16.839
But something tells me that
those feelings are still there.

to celebrate.

plenty tomorrow.

your assignment.

a second leak

1:05:51.248 --> 1:05:52.847
that I didn't see
the first time.

1:05:52.883 --> 1:05:55.717

all patched up now.

Take care of yourself.

1:06:08.398 --> 1:06:09.531
See you tomorrow, sir.

1:06:09.566 --> 1:06:10.598
I am so sorry.

sometimes.

1:06:12.369 --> 1:06:13.568
It's fine.

1:06:13.637 --> 1:06:16.237
I really did try and fix it
last time, though.

to ask you in person.

to the wedding.

1:06:24.581 --> 1:06:25.680

about my leaving.

1:06:27.617 --> 1:06:29.117

1:06:29.186 --> 1:06:31.653

and I don't think this is

1:06:31.688 --> 1:06:33.955

to move anyways.

1:06:35.258 --> 1:06:37.592
You're not going to London now?

1:06:40.130 --> 1:06:42.731
Okay... Um...

1:06:45.102 --> 1:06:47.268
Does it have anything
to do with...

1:06:47.337 --> 1:06:47.802

1:06:47.838 --> 1:06:48.336
No, us?

1:06:48.372 --> 1:06:49.838

1:06:49.873 --> 1:06:51.172
Okay.

1:06:51.208 --> 1:06:53.141
No. Like you said, this place
is hard to leave.

1:06:53.210 --> 1:06:56.811
And... I mean, who else is gonna
move the snowman next year?

1:06:56.847 --> 1:06:59.447
Right?

1:06:59.483 --> 1:07:01.416

now, so...

1:07:06.823 --> 1:07:08.656
Is that a no?

1:07:08.692 --> 1:07:13.495
No. Just means you're gonna have
to meet me there.

1:07:19.236 --> 1:07:19.801

1:07:22.572 --> 1:07:23.671

1:07:26.410 --> 1:07:28.276
Right this way.

1:07:28.311 --> 1:07:31.146
And you can set up in there,
and we'll be right in.

1:07:31.181 --> 1:07:33.782
Thank you.

1:07:33.817 --> 1:07:36.017
You ready for some pampering?

1:07:36.053 --> 1:07:37.685
I am, I am, but you really
don't have to do this.

something, too.

to get me anything.

maid of honour,

1:07:51.568 --> 1:07:56.004
but... I'm pretty sure you need
something old.

Oh. That's beautiful.

found you, too.

when I can give it back to you.

them the rings...

father relaxed.

1:09:11.748 --> 1:09:14.349

everyone is seated.

1:09:14.384 --> 1:09:15.183

Well, I kind of thought I would
be, but no, I'm...I'm good.

1:09:30.100 --> 1:09:32.433
How about you?

1:09:32.502 --> 1:09:34.002
Same.

1:09:34.638 --> 1:09:36.271
That makes me happy.

1:15:59.155 --> 1:16:01.422
We've... we've both lost.

1:16:01.491 --> 1:16:03.824
But you can't hide behind
that forever.

1:16:03.860 --> 1:16:05.159
You can't always take
the safe way out

1:16:05.194 --> 1:16:09.463
because you don't want
to risk anything.

1:16:09.532 --> 1:16:11.499

Sam.

1:16:22.178 --> 1:16:23.444
...get back in there.

1:16:24.480 --> 1:16:25.479
I'm gonna...

1:16:32.655 --> 1:16:35.256
Now, some of
these are a little silly

1:16:35.291 --> 1:16:36.057
[chuckles]

1:16:36.092 --> 1:16:37.592
But, I hope you like 'em.

1:16:37.627 --> 1:16:42.029
We're gonna love them, but...

1:16:42.098 --> 1:16:43.564
I wanna do this one.

1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:45.633

1:16:45.702 --> 1:16:46.934
Merry Christmas.

1:16:47.003 --> 1:16:50.471
Oh, guys, I told you not
to get me anything.

1:16:50.506 --> 1:16:52.974
I know, but it's important
to us.

1:17:00.083 --> 1:17:02.316
What is this?

1:17:05.555 --> 1:17:08.356
Oh... This is about the house.

1:17:08.391 --> 1:17:12.460
Mm-hmm.

1:17:12.528 --> 1:17:16.664
You signed the house over to me?

1:17:16.699 --> 1:17:18.132
What?

1:17:18.167 --> 1:17:20.701
Helen and I really want you
to have the house.

1:17:20.737 --> 1:17:21.836
And I know your mother

1:17:21.871 --> 1:17:24.372
would want you to have
the house, too.

1:17:26.275 --> 1:17:28.175
Guys, I don't even...
I don't...

1:17:28.244 --> 1:17:29.143

1:17:29.212 --> 1:17:29.944
Thank you.

1:17:34.784 --> 1:17:36.651
Thank you.

1:17:38.621 --> 1:17:40.688
You know, I think this might
be the first time ever

1:17:40.723 --> 1:17:44.158
that you haven't devoured your
donut before we left the café.

1:17:44.193 --> 1:17:46.460
Hey, well, if you don't want
it, I can always...

1:17:46.496 --> 1:17:49.163
All right, never mind,
I don't want it.

1:17:49.198 --> 1:17:51.298
You feeling okay?

1:17:51.334 --> 1:17:55.169
Yeah, no, I... I just didn't
sleep much last night.

1:17:55.238 --> 1:17:56.971
Is this about Sam?

1:17:57.040 --> 1:17:59.340
Well, what about Sam?

1:17:59.375 --> 1:18:01.475
Oh, did I mess things up
by mentioning that...

1:18:01.511 --> 1:18:02.843
Dad.

1:18:02.912 --> 1:18:05.413
You were just stating a fact,
you know?

1:18:05.448 --> 1:18:09.984
It was a good opportunity,
but... It's all good.

1:18:13.389 --> 1:18:16.724
No it's not all good.

with Mike on this.

1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:32.506
He said you guys were talking
about rental stuff.

1:18:32.542 --> 1:18:34.041
Yeah, he knew a guy that could
help us out last minute

1:18:34.077 --> 1:18:36.343
to get it done.

1:18:36.379 --> 1:18:37.978
