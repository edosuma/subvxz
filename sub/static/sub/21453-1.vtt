01:30.419 --> 01:31.964
Nothing.

01:35.123 --> 01:36.490
Hit and run.

01:39.093 --> 01:41.297
Whoever it was, they're gone.

01:41.797 --> 01:44.058
War's over. He got the memo.

01:46.401 --> 01:47.962
Ize?

01:50.656 --> 01:52.225
Allen?

01:53.075 --> 01:54.577
Ize.

01:54.777 --> 01:56.285
What?

01:57.426 --> 02:01.051
We got no movement,
not a sign of a shadow. How...

02:02.451 --> 02:05.145
How long we been here, man? 18-plus?

02:08.523 --> 02:10.818
- Twenty.
- Jesus.

02:13.662 --> 02:15.956
There's nobody fucking out there, man.

02:17.598 --> 02:20.346
- 'Less he's a pro.
- A Hajji?

02:20.936 --> 02:22.997
I'm just saying, maybe.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.702
Six construction guys on that pipeline.

02:30.579 --> 02:33.515
Two-man security escort.

02:33.615 --> 02:35.184
Yeah.

02:35.624 --> 02:37.487
Look at 'em.

02:39.187 --> 02:40.222
What?

02:40.322 --> 02:43.326
Not one body near
to anything resembling cover.

02:44.126 --> 02:47.382
- That's just fucking weird to me.
- Don't mean shit, man.

02:47.482 --> 02:50.291
Means he took them out pretty fucking fast.

03:00.809 --> 03:03.512
And I think they're all
fucking head shots, too.

03:03.612 --> 03:08.176
Fuck off. Look, hey. Check out our boy
with the radio, he got the call out?

03:10.886 --> 03:14.106
- Yeah.
- That ain't a head shot, Ize.

03:14.206 --> 03:18.285
Okay, fine, so one
without a fucking head shot.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.196
I mean, eight guys, 30 seconds?

03:20.296 --> 03:22.598
So you're saying a Hajji
went in there with a semi-auto?

03:22.698 --> 03:24.932
Said he might be a pro.

03:25.032 --> 03:27.436
Right. We're dealing with Juba now?

03:28.336 --> 03:30.197
Might be.

03:31.106 --> 03:33.370
I'm just saying, that wall's cursed.

03:33.470 --> 03:36.478
It's a wall, man.
You're scared of a fucking wall?

03:36.778 --> 03:39.061
Nah, I'm scared of what's behind it.

03:39.581 --> 03:43.185
Could be two Hajjis sucking
each other off behind that thing.

03:43.685 --> 03:45.320
Hey.

03:45.420 --> 03:47.290
What's there is there.

03:47.790 --> 03:50.406
Rest of that shit's in your head,
you understand?

04:20.789 --> 04:22.350
Ize?

04:24.626 --> 04:27.616
What's your vote now? Got anyone out there?

04:29.096 --> 04:30.632
No.

04:30.732 --> 04:33.160
I mean, I was 60% sure.

04:36.236 --> 04:38.407
Now I'm, like, 80.

04:39.207 --> 04:41.068
I don't think so.

04:44.412 --> 04:47.082
Or... yep, he's a pro.

04:47.182 --> 04:49.822
Fuck off. Probably the same as it always is.

04:49.922 --> 04:52.747
Four or five Hajjis came in
and bushwhacked 'em.

04:55.157 --> 04:57.226
Yeah, makes sense.

05:00.155 --> 05:01.688
Maybe.

05:11.523 --> 05:13.325
Or he's a pro.

05:13.675 --> 05:16.378
- I'm fucking hot. I'm calling it.
- See, fuck you, man.

05:16.478 --> 05:18.714
I knew that's what you wanted to do.

05:18.814 --> 05:22.351
I'm fucking with you, man.
What, are you fucking hungry again?

05:22.451 --> 05:24.753
Already had four or five MREs, gorilla fuck.

05:24.853 --> 05:27.456
I'm not fucking sitting here dancing
around your super-theories...

05:27.556 --> 05:30.025
...that a fucking super-sniper's
down there, bro.

05:30.125 --> 05:32.996
No fucking way a Hajji
sticks around this long.

05:34.296 --> 05:36.098
You shitting me?

05:36.198 --> 05:40.135
I'm fucking hot as shit.
My balls have melted into one fucking ball.

05:40.235 --> 05:42.738
Later, you're on duty,
you're gonna pry these apart, all right?

05:42.838 --> 05:46.676
- Yeah, if I can fucking find it.
- And you're gonna fucking like it, too.

05:47.676 --> 05:49.211
I should've joined the fucking Air Force.

05:49.311 --> 05:53.207
You're too fucking big for the Air Force.
You'd bring the whole thing down.

05:54.949 --> 05:56.986
Hey, I'm serious, man.

05:57.686 --> 06:00.825
- Get down.
- I'm serious, too. I'm going down there...

06:00.925 --> 06:05.627
...grabbing that guy's radio, coming back
up here, and we are getting the fuck gone.

06:05.727 --> 06:08.029
Yeah, roger that.

06:13.271 --> 06:14.636
Comm check.

06:14.736 --> 06:17.765
Yup-yup. Check-check.

06:31.819 --> 06:33.978
Where have you gone?

06:35.231 --> 06:38.460
- Yep.
- <i>Movement?</i>

06:38.560 --> 06:41.255
You look fucking rigid as shit.

06:44.298 --> 06:46.102
<i>How's that one ball?</i>

06:46.892 --> 06:49.338
Real nice. Real smart.

06:49.438 --> 06:51.932
<i>You'll always be number one to me, my man.</i>

06:57.611 --> 07:01.416
- You got eyes on that wall?
- I got eyes on your ass.

07:03.131 --> 07:06.748
Shake that booty. Yeah, there it is.

07:08.556 --> 07:10.826
There we go. There it is.

07:10.926 --> 07:12.895
I think your tampon just fell out.

07:12.995 --> 07:15.656
<i>Damn right. That'd usually cost you 25 bucks.</i>

07:16.519 --> 07:18.732
<i>I'll make love to you</i>

07:18.832 --> 07:21.322
<i>Like you want me to </i>

07:32.347 --> 07:34.409
You're clear 360.

07:36.651 --> 07:38.513
Keep them eyes open.

07:48.429 --> 07:51.693
- Just watch my six.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

08:01.676 --> 08:03.938
Yeah, we're fucking solo out here.

08:07.582 --> 08:09.410
Lonely as fuck.

08:23.931 --> 08:25.067
Fuck.

08:25.167 --> 08:28.003
<i>I'm getting closer here.
You got eyes on that wall?</i>

08:28.103 --> 08:29.964
Roger that.

08:32.339 --> 08:34.950
- Shit.
- <i>What?</i>

08:35.049 --> 08:36.607
This...

08:38.013 --> 08:40.378
Man, this fucking thing's fogging up, man.

08:44.317 --> 08:46.747
<i>You have got to get rid of that shit.</i>

08:51.124 --> 08:52.994
It was Dean's.

08:53.094 --> 08:55.740
<i>Fuck Dean. Dean was a bitch.</i>

08:56.264 --> 08:59.707
Yeah, fuck Dean. Dean was a bitch.

09:00.402 --> 09:02.877
<i>Bad juju carrying around a dead man's scope.</i>

09:44.679 --> 09:46.508
Something's not right.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.352
What?

09:50.452 --> 09:53.489
Talk to me, man, talk to me.
What's going on down there?

09:54.289 --> 09:57.151
<i>Ize, they are head shots, man.</i>

10:02.897 --> 10:04.959
<i>Can you tell where they came from?</i>

10:15.576 --> 10:18.868
<i>You know what, fuck it.
Get the hell out of there, bro.</i>

10:19.815 --> 10:23.276

27:08.188 --> 27:10.057
Goddamn.

27:10.357 --> 27:14.261
7.62x51.

27:14.461 --> 27:18.632
No, we got a shooter.
High-caliber weapon. Requesting UAV.

27:18.732 --> 27:22.269
<i>We need your challenge code
before we send in medevac.</i>

27:22.369 --> 27:25.439
- What? Say that again.
- <i>Send your challenge code.</i>

27:25.539 --> 27:28.368
What the fuck is... no. But...

27:33.847 --> 27:37.351
- Who is this?
- <i>This is Captain Otis Simmons.</i>

27:37.451 --> 27:42.256
<i>I need your challenge code if I'm gonna
get you and your staff Sar'nt medevac.</i>

27:42.356 --> 27:46.460
Romeo, no... no, wait,
I didn't say I needed medical assistance.

27:46.560 --> 27:50.565
- Do you copy?
- <i>Copy that. I assumed.</i>

27:51.565 --> 27:53.659
<i>But this is protocol.</i>

27:57.236 --> 27:59.851
Well, fuck me. How do I know that?

27:59.951 --> 28:02.209
That you are who you say you are?

28:02.609 --> 28:05.646
<i>Allen Isaac. You and your
staff Sergeant Shane Matthews...</i>

28:05.746 --> 28:09.450
<i>...made an overnight worm into a kill zone
to investigate a potential sniper...</i>

28:09.550 --> 28:11.852
<i>...and report back to us.</i>

28:11.952 --> 28:14.034
Okay, okay.

28:14.134 --> 28:17.169
All right, I'm sorry. I'm a little fucked up.

28:17.269 --> 28:20.920
Listen, you got to bring a heavy escort.
This guy's a fucking asshole.

28:30.436 --> 28:32.532
Where do you keep going?

28:35.875 --> 28:37.937
<i>Do you have a flare, Sergeant?</i>

28:42.481 --> 28:44.029
<i>Do you copy?</i>

28:44.129 --> 28:47.788
Yeah. No, I don't.
I have an M4 and a sidearm.

28:47.888 --> 28:50.524
<i>I need you to stand and fire into the air.</i>

28:50.624 --> 28:54.489
- <i>We need to get a lock on your position.</i>
- What the fuck?

28:54.589 --> 28:58.632
This ain't ranger school. The fucking shooter
will get a fucking lock on my position.

28:58.732 --> 29:02.772
<i>Well, I can't help you unless I know
your location. Do you copy?</i>

29:06.439 --> 29:07.774
Fuck.

29:07.874 --> 29:11.411
A lot of fucking help you've been
so fucking far, motherfucker.

29:21.954 --> 29:24.325
This is fucking stupid.
This ain't fucking protocol.

29:24.425 --> 29:27.761
<i>Sergeant, we need your exact location
to send in medevac.</i>

29:27.861 --> 29:29.663
Say that again.

29:30.363 --> 29:34.601
- <i>I need your location.</i>
- No, my rank. What's my rank?

29:34.901 --> 29:36.462
<i>Sergeant.</i>

29:38.538 --> 29:40.107
You...

29:40.607 --> 29:42.409
...you got an accent.

29:42.809 --> 29:44.638
Not American.

29:47.079 --> 29:49.516
<i>You have seen through my camouflage.</i>

29:50.316 --> 29:52.187
Fuck you talking about?

29:53.587 --> 29:56.682
<i>I'm talking about hiding behind words.</i>

29:58.057 --> 30:00.506
<i>Like you are hiding behind that wall.</i>

30:02.129 --> 30:04.590
You... you're...

30:06.666 --> 30:08.195
Motherf...

30:12.736 --> 30:14.254
Shit.

30:17.444 --> 30:19.705
You fuck!

30:22.515 --> 30:24.585
<i>I've got a question for you.</i>

30:25.585 --> 30:28.280
<i>Your friend... is he dead?</i>

30:29.023 --> 30:33.093
- <i>He... he looks dead to me.</i>
- This is Spartan 33 sending in the blind.

30:33.193 --> 30:35.195
<i>But maybe he's just unconscious.</i>

30:35.295 --> 30:37.431
I got a man down!

30:37.531 --> 30:40.334
- <i>Shall I make sure?</i>
- I got a sniper.

30:40.434 --> 30:44.405
- I got an enemy sniper. Requesting medevac!
- <i>Shall I shoot him in the head?</i>

30:44.505 --> 30:49.169
- I repeat. I repeat. Requesting...
- <i>Does he have a wife? Children?</i>

30:54.914 --> 30:58.953
<i>Will they enjoy a closed casket
if I take his face off?</i>

31:00.053 --> 31:02.656
All right, all right, shut the fuck up, man.

31:02.756 --> 31:05.448
All right, stop, stop, stop, stop.

31:14.533 --> 31:16.436
Is there something that you want?

31:16.536 --> 31:19.373
- <i>Yes.</i>
- I don't know nothing.

31:19.473 --> 31:23.377
I'm a buck Sar'nt.
They don't tell me shit. So fuck you.

31:23.477 --> 31:27.342
- <i>That's not what I want.</i>
- Oh, what do you want?

31:27.447 --> 31:30.143
You want fucking 12 virgins or something?

31:32.685 --> 31:34.721
<i>I want to get to know you.</i>

31:35.021 --> 31:37.524
<i>I just want to get to know you.</i>

31:37.624 --> 31:39.485
<i>Will you allow that?</i>

31:42.928 --> 31:44.790
You're fucking with me.

31:46.099 --> 31:49.771
<i>I was, but you figured it out.</i>

31:50.441 --> 31:52.773
<i>So now let's be real.</i>

31:52.873 --> 31:55.309
<i>It's just you and me out here.</i>

31:56.209 --> 31:58.103
So, what do you say?

32:00.179 --> 32:04.118
- Yeah, I'll talk to you.
- <i>Good. Where are you from?</i>

32:04.218 --> 32:08.514
No. Listen, I don't know shit
about you, so why don't you go first?

32:11.690 --> 32:16.369
<i>Me? There is nothing to say. No story.</i>

32:18.031 --> 32:20.494
You're the one who wants to get chatty, bro.

32:37.283 --> 32:39.298
Why ain't you saying anything?

32:49.261 --> 32:52.091
<i>Okay. I'll start.</i>

32:55.401 --> 32:59.674
<i>I am just a regular Iraqi man.</i>

33:07.746 --> 33:09.584
<i>A civilian.</i>

33:09.834 --> 33:11.594
A civilian, my ass.

33:15.321 --> 33:17.725
Crack bang.

33:18.225 --> 33:21.094
One, two, three, four, five.

33:22.694 --> 33:25.378
One, two, three, four, five.

33:25.478 --> 33:27.734
One, two, three, four, bang.

33:28.334 --> 33:30.137
Four plus four.

33:30.937 --> 33:35.031
Four plus four, 800. Plus...

33:44.216 --> 33:45.763
Okay.

33:48.654 --> 33:50.224
Bullet.

33:50.724 --> 33:53.126
45, 50, 60.

33:53.226 --> 33:55.282
60-degree angle.

33:56.963 --> 34:00.326
Nine, 950... 950 plus...

34:06.238 --> 34:08.069
That gives me...

34:09.109 --> 34:10.969
...1,500.

34:20.585 --> 34:23.849
Okay. Okay.

34:24.790 --> 34:28.893
Got the wall, me, Matthews.

34:39.938 --> 34:43.275
Crane, construction site...

34:43.376 --> 34:45.712
...trailers, flagpole.

34:46.012 --> 34:47.880
<i>And you?</i>

34:48.380 --> 34:50.409
What about me?

34:51.317 --> 34:53.721
<i>Are you a regular American?</i>

34:55.621 --> 34:57.643
Yeah, a regular joe.

34:59.092 --> 35:01.587
<i>A regular G.I. Joe.</i>

35:06.165 --> 35:08.427
<i>Army ranger or Marine?</i>

35:11.136 --> 35:13.139
You worked in our fucking ranks?

35:13.239 --> 35:16.776
Had our training,
and then you fucking backstab us.

35:16.876 --> 35:20.814
Look, these fucking guys
were building pipelines.

35:20.914 --> 35:24.209
Building up your fucking
economy, you asshole.

35:26.953 --> 35:28.556
<i>Pipelines?</i>

35:29.856 --> 35:31.859
<i>For our economy?</i>

35:32.659 --> 35:34.594
Yeah, that's fucking money.

35:34.694 --> 35:37.732
Infrastructure, education, schools.

35:38.332 --> 35:40.467
These guys were fucking contractors.

35:40.567 --> 35:42.402
Not here to fight.

35:42.502 --> 35:44.304
War's over, bro.

35:44.904 --> 35:46.440
<i>Bro?</i>

35:47.140 --> 35:48.942
Whatever, man.

35:49.042 --> 35:51.312
<i>It's an interesting choice of words.</i>

35:52.012 --> 35:54.981
<i>And yet I disagree with you, bro.</i>

35:55.081 --> 35:56.942
<i>The war's not over.</i>

35:59.151 --> 36:01.413
<i>Definitely not for you.</i>

36:06.391 --> 36:09.630
You say... you say a lot of fucking
fancy words. What are you, Ha...

36:09.730 --> 36:12.170
...Hajji Shakespeare or some shit?

36:13.399 --> 36:15.069
<i>Shakespeare?</i>

36:15.419 --> 36:17.688
<i>Military lingo is all poetry.</i>

36:17.788 --> 36:20.190
<i>Battle rattle, ghetto grip.</i>

36:20.790 --> 36:23.853
<i>Johnny Jihad, friendly fire.</i>

36:38.823 --> 36:40.660
<i>Your turn, Isaac.</i>

36:40.760 --> 36:42.812
<i>Or should I say "Ize"?</i>

36:47.066 --> 36:50.804
What? What do you mean it's my turn?
What you want me to say?

36:50.904 --> 36:54.608
<i>Tell me where you're from.
Where's your family?</i>

36:54.708 --> 36:56.743
I'm not talking about fucking family.

36:57.677 --> 36:59.272
God.

37:05.050 --> 37:08.515
<i>Okay, then tell me about
your brothers and sisters at arms.</i>

37:09.272 --> 37:11.141
That's a negative, too, bro.

37:11.241 --> 37:14.444
<i>I don't want any military secrets,
just stories.</i>

37:14.544 --> 37:18.132
- Eat a dick.
- <i>I will shoot Matthews if you don't talk.</i>

37:18.232 --> 37:20.100
Go ahead.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.981
<i>Yes?</i>

37:25.337 --> 37:27.374
<i>He is your second loss.</i>

37:27.974 --> 37:31.011
<i>First Dean, now Matthews.</i>

37:31.511 --> 37:33.413
How the fuck do you know about Dean?

37:33.513 --> 37:36.341
- <i>Keep talking.</i>
- No, fuck you. How?

37:38.134 --> 37:40.370
<i>You carry his scope around.</i>

37:40.470 --> 37:42.372
<i>What was it your sergeant said?</i>

37:42.472 --> 37:44.533
<i>"A dead man's scope"?</i>

37:51.162 --> 37:52.758
You...

37:57.136 --> 37:59.373
<i>Just tell me something, Isaac.</i>

37:59.773 --> 38:01.702
<i>Tell me about your comrades.</i>

38:01.842 --> 38:04.220
<i>Or I will shoot Matthews' face off.</i>

38:07.714 --> 38:09.241
Okay.

38:17.964 --> 38:21.412
Yeah. We... we play ball.

38:21.762 --> 38:23.597
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

38:25.547 --> 38:29.769
Yeah, no, me... me and the squad,
we... we play in the afternoon.

38:30.946 --> 38:33.206
Get baked in the Iraqi sun.

38:34.483 --> 38:37.677
Nothing else to do. No war to fight.

38:37.777 --> 38:39.279
<i>"Baked"?</i>

38:39.779 --> 38:41.673
<i>What does that mean?</i>

38:44.066 --> 38:46.695
Baked, like, you know, tanned.

38:55.193 --> 38:57.063
<i>Go on.</i>

38:57.463 --> 38:59.325
Go on?

39:00.999 --> 39:03.203
<i>What about Sergeant Matthews?</i>

39:03.303 --> 39:05.197
<i>Did he get baked?</i>

39:08.175 --> 39:09.864
<i>Did Dean?</i>

39:11.644 --> 39:15.282
I ain't talking about fucking Dean
with you, you dirty fucking Hajji.

39:16.382 --> 39:19.468
<i>If I were you, I would start talking, Isaac.</i>

39:19.986 --> 39:21.841
<i>Tell me about Dean.</i>

39:23.355 --> 39:25.191
What's the obsession?

39:25.591 --> 39:29.228
- What the fuck?
- <i>It's interesting to me...</i>

39:29.328 --> 39:32.158
<i>...the bond between you and your brothers.</i>

39:34.900 --> 39:38.335
<i>And I will shoot Matthews
if you do not speak.</i>

39:39.839 --> 39:44.692
I'm looking at him right now.
It would be so easy to tear his face off.

39:47.146 --> 39:49.549
<i>His family won't even recognize him.</i>

39:50.002 --> 39:52.077
<i>Is that what you want, Ize?</i>

40:01.894 --> 40:04.350
<i>You should just answer my questions.</i>

40:06.566 --> 40:08.994
All right, all right.

40:24.616 --> 40:26.845
<i>So, tell me about Dean's scope.</i>

40:29.662 --> 40:31.558
Oh, fuck.

40:31.658 --> 40:34.361
<i>I can see it at the base of the wall there.</i>

40:34.461 --> 40:36.329
<i>Why do you keep it?</i>

40:36.429 --> 40:38.047
Fuck.

40:49.041 --> 40:52.905
<i>You said it's broken. Why would you
carry around a broken scope, Isaac?</i>

40:54.978 --> 40:57.851
Shut the fuck up, man. How's this end?

40:58.051 --> 40:59.920
How the fuck's this end?

41:01.120 --> 41:02.981
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

41:04.773 --> 41:08.457
I said, how the fuck's it end?
What's the fucking endgame?

41:09.478 --> 41:13.099
<i>There's no endgame.
I'm just enjoying our conversation.</i>

41:13.199 --> 41:17.237
Stop. Fucking stop, all right?
You're not gonna get to fucking know me.

41:17.737 --> 41:19.673
<i>But I feel like I know you better already.</i>

41:19.773 --> 41:23.609
No, you fucking don't! You don't know shit.

41:23.709 --> 41:27.714
You're dehydrated, I know that.
That's why I aimed at your water bottle.

41:27.814 --> 41:30.250
No, you didn't.
You fucking was trying to hit me.

41:30.350 --> 41:32.411
<i>No. The water bottle.</i>

41:34.253 --> 41:36.256
Nobody's that fucking accurate.

41:36.756 --> 41:38.562
<i>And your antenna.</i>

41:39.759 --> 41:41.928
No fucking way.

41:42.028 --> 41:43.460
<i>And your knee.</i>

41:43.830 --> 41:46.597
<i>I know the popliteal vein in your leg...</i>

41:46.697 --> 41:49.895
<i>...carries enough blood that, no matter
what kind of bandaging you have...</i>

41:49.995 --> 41:53.039
<i>...you will still be sitting
in a puddle of plasma.</i>

41:53.539 --> 41:56.776
<i>You're feeling fatigued, lightheaded.</i>

41:56.876 --> 41:59.914
<i>And you will bleed out before nightfall.</i>

42:00.814 --> 42:03.632
What the fuck is going on with this shit?

42:04.565 --> 42:06.461
You fucker.

42:08.054 --> 42:10.256
You psychotic motherfucker.

42:10.656 --> 42:12.884
What do you want from me?

42:14.888 --> 42:16.455
Fuck!

42:29.876 --> 42:31.478
Fucking...

42:31.578 --> 42:34.206
Fucking... Hajji.

42:48.426 --> 42:51.048
Hey, where do you keep fucking going?

42:52.631 --> 42:56.061
No, no, you're trying to fucking
circle my wall, ain't you?

42:58.137 --> 43:00.974
Trying to circle around my wall,
motherfucker?

43:01.574 --> 43:03.176
<i>That's ironic.</i>

43:03.276 --> 43:05.480
Yeah, I'm right?

43:07.279 --> 43:09.683
<i>You say "my wall."</i>

43:10.383 --> 43:13.595
<i>The very wall your country
came here to knock down...</i>

43:13.953 --> 43:16.790
<i>...you now try desperately
to keep from falling.</i>

43:18.179 --> 43:20.593
You find that fucking funny?

43:20.693 --> 43:24.364
<i>You should know,
that wall you're hiding behind...</i>

43:24.464 --> 43:26.759
<i>...was actually part of a school.</i>

43:28.901 --> 43:32.071
Yeah, well, I'll piss on it.
That's what I think about your fucking wall.

43:32.171 --> 43:34.541
<i>You're hiding in the shadow of Islam.</i>

43:34.641 --> 43:37.811
No, I'm hiding in the shadow
of fucking death.

43:37.911 --> 43:40.973
I'm in the fucking shadow of death.

43:55.994 --> 43:59.667
Nice try. That's got to be a 20 mag.

44:07.105 --> 44:08.909
So all the guys...

44:10.609 --> 44:12.671
It's got to be 20 mag.

44:30.229 --> 44:32.265
One in Matthews...

44:32.965 --> 44:35.027
...three in me.

44:45.542 --> 44:47.414
That 76...

44:47.714 --> 44:51.777
...that 7.62x51 NATO round is U.S. issued?

44:54.220 --> 44:56.222
Hey, motherfucker.

44:56.422 --> 44:59.559
You want to talk? Come on, man. What's up?

44:59.659 --> 45:01.561
<i>You want to know the weapon I'm using.</i>

45:01.661 --> 45:05.132
M24? Mark 11?

45:05.232 --> 45:08.668
<i>I would prefer an M96 Windrunner any day.</i>

45:09.268 --> 45:11.470
I thought we were being honest.

45:11.570 --> 45:13.773
I know you're using a Mark 11.

45:13.873 --> 45:17.110
<i>No, you believe that's what I'm using.</i>

45:17.210 --> 45:19.913
<i>But you don't know anything for certain.</i>

45:20.013 --> 45:21.881
<i>You don't know shit.</i>

45:22.448 --> 45:25.285
<i>Is that how you say it?</i>
<i>"You don't know shit"?</i>

45:25.385 --> 45:27.187
Say that again.

45:27.987 --> 45:29.881
I can't hear you.

45:31.257 --> 45:32.759
<i>Okay.</i>

45:33.059 --> 45:34.494
<i>You...</i>

45:34.594 --> 45:36.029
<i>...don't...</i>

45:36.129 --> 45:38.556
<i>...know... shit.</i>

45:45.069 --> 45:47.440
I don't know shit?

45:47.540 --> 45:49.409
Well, go on, please.

45:49.509 --> 45:51.370
Educate me, man.

45:53.011 --> 45:55.341
Come on, I'm listening.

45:59.352 --> 46:01.421
<i>You Americans...</i>

46:01.921 --> 46:03.924
<i>...you think you know it all.</i>

46:05.024 --> 46:06.860
<i>You think it's simple.</i>

46:07.160 --> 46:09.029
<i>That I am your enemy.</i>

46:09.629 --> 46:12.432
<i>But we are not so different, you and I.</i>

46:13.032 --> 46:15.435
Yeah, except I ain't a fucking terrorist.

46:16.885 --> 46:18.847
<i>And you think I am?</i>

46:22.641 --> 46:26.319
<i>You are the one who has come
to another man's country.</i>

46:28.880 --> 46:31.719
<i>Camouflaged yourself in his land...</i>

46:32.619 --> 46:34.467
<i>...in his soil.</i>

46:37.689 --> 46:39.691
No fucking way.

46:41.960 --> 46:43.930
<i>From where I'm sitting...</i>

46:44.030 --> 46:47.301
<i>...you look very much like the terrorist.</i>

46:53.521 --> 46:56.166
You're in the fucking trash?

46:57.776 --> 46:59.472
No fucking way.

47:02.642 --> 47:04.722
Unless he's a pro.

47:08.820 --> 47:10.624
You're him.

47:11.574 --> 47:13.409
You're Juba.

47:13.959 --> 47:15.829
The ghost.

47:17.029 --> 47:19.798
<i>A hundred men out there call themselves Juba.</i>

47:19.898 --> 47:21.747
<i>I'm just a man.</i>

47:24.036 --> 47:26.546
35 U.S. casualties...

47:26.646 --> 47:28.492
...angel of death.

47:30.009 --> 47:32.213
That's why they never find you.

47:35.141 --> 47:36.683
Damn.

47:37.483 --> 47:40.971
You must've been days
in that fucking shit heap.

47:45.324 --> 47:49.362
So, we trained you, obviously.

47:50.162 --> 47:55.404
Learn how to shoot, trajectory, zeroing
the rifle, no reloads between shots.

47:56.502 --> 47:59.138
Learned all that shit and then betrayed us?

47:59.238 --> 48:01.875
<i>Depends on the angle you look at it from.</i>

48:01.975 --> 48:03.843
Only one angle.

48:04.643 --> 48:07.100
<i>Yes, as I'd expect you to say.</i>

48:08.381 --> 48:13.254
No. Tell me you're my enemy...
fine, I'll respect that.

48:13.619 --> 48:15.721
We kill, we kill.

48:15.821 --> 48:17.740
But say you're my friend...

48:17.840 --> 48:22.028
...and shoot me in the back,
the only angle I see is a fucking snake.

48:22.128 --> 48:26.232
<i>But if this friend shoots you
in the back and you survive...</i>

48:26.332 --> 48:28.594
<i>...is it okay to shoot him back?</i>

48:34.472 --> 48:36.743
<i>I want you to tell me something, Isaac.</i>

48:38.043 --> 48:39.880
<i>Why are you here?</i>

48:41.080 --> 48:43.309
<i>Why are you still here, Isaac?</i>

48:46.418 --> 48:48.784
<i>How many tours have you done now?</i>

48:51.156 --> 48:53.385
<i>Why do you keep coming back?</i>

49:03.469 --> 49:06.740
- <i>Is it because of Dean?</i>
- You've got to...

49:07.540 --> 49:09.802
How the fuck did I get here?

49:12.331 --> 49:16.082
<i>Is that why? Be honest with me, Isaac.</i>

49:16.182 --> 49:18.076
<i>Is it because of Dean?</i>

49:22.253 --> 49:24.124
Just tell me...

49:24.924 --> 49:26.393
...how...

49:26.493 --> 49:28.187
...did you know...

49:28.287 --> 49:30.369
...how'd you know that name?

49:31.930 --> 49:34.145
<i>Tell me one thing about him.</i>

49:35.017 --> 49:36.878
<i>Just one thing.</i>

49:44.776 --> 49:47.413
We were from around about the same area.

49:48.213 --> 49:50.049
His cousins...

49:50.449 --> 49:52.662
...went to the same school as me.

49:53.786 --> 49:55.840
My dad knows his...

49:56.951 --> 49:58.826
...seen his kid.

50:00.992 --> 50:02.829
Held him.

50:03.429 --> 50:05.691
More than Dean's ever done.

50:09.567 --> 50:12.438
Clem works by the fucking stop n' shop.

50:13.627 --> 50:15.208
<i>Clem?</i>

50:15.808 --> 50:17.869
Clementine, his wife.

50:21.913 --> 50:25.151
No fucking way. I can't...
I can't go back to that.

50:25.251 --> 50:27.687
Fucking day in, day out shit.

50:28.787 --> 50:30.648
And them looking at me.

50:33.191 --> 50:34.994
And they would. They...

50:35.594 --> 50:38.031
...they'd look at me and they'd...

50:39.431 --> 50:41.493
...they'd see me.

50:43.234 --> 50:44.815
Fuck.

50:46.672 --> 50:48.174
Nope.

50:48.474 --> 50:51.887
I can't go... I can't... I can't do that.

50:51.987 --> 50:53.869
I can't go back.

50:58.451 --> 51:00.334
Oh, my God.

51:03.022 --> 51:04.536
Fuck.

51:17.169 --> 51:18.972
You happy now?

51:19.472 --> 51:21.507
Now you know everything.

51:21.907 --> 51:24.377
You're fucked up, you know that?

51:24.677 --> 51:25.945
<i>Why is that?</i>

51:26.045 --> 51:28.877
'Cause you got to mess
with my fucking head, too.

51:39.991 --> 51:42.828
<i>Isaac, when this is over...</i>

51:42.928 --> 51:46.158
<i>...the skin will be cut from your face.</i>

51:49.300 --> 51:51.670
<i>Your eyes will be gouged.</i>

51:51.770 --> 51:54.540
Fucking shoot me, you prick.

51:54.640 --> 51:58.242
<i>Your lying tongue
will be stapled to your chest.</i>

52:02.147 --> 52:05.401
Just fucking shoot me, man. Get it over with.

52:06.051 --> 52:08.221
<i>But I will let them find your body.</i>

52:08.321 --> 52:10.783
Fuck it, I might just shoot myself.

53:08.363 --> 53:12.026
All right, you asshole, where are you?

53:39.160 --> 53:40.229
Okay.

53:46.268 --> 53:48.729
All right, you stupid motherfucker.

53:49.172 --> 53:52.100
Bite on this, you fucking Hajji bitch.

53:58.863 --> 54:02.667
Come on, show me something. Send it, bitch.

55:48.239 --> 55:49.774
Fuck.

57:02.313 --> 57:03.874
Fuck.

57:30.450 --> 57:31.707
Shit.

57:32.725 --> 57:34.238
Fuck!

58:52.757 --> 58:54.960
<i>That was foolish, Isaac.</i>

58:55.060 --> 58:58.489
<i>I could've shot you.
I could've easily shot you.</i>

59:03.434 --> 59:04.938
<i>Ize.</i>

59:07.405 --> 59:10.434
<i>I just want to have
a conversation with you, Isaac.</i>

59:15.813 --> 59:18.367
<i>Why are you trying to get yourself killed?</i>

59:41.539 --> 59:43.601
<i>Isaac, are you there?</i>

59:53.587 --> 59:55.110
Fuck.

01:00:02.895 --> 01:00:04.348
<i>Isaac.</i>

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:09.545
<i>Isaac... the radio you risked
your life for, it's dead.</i>

01:00:13.505 --> 01:00:15.341
<i>Are you dead, too?</i>

01:00:16.041 --> 01:00:18.310
You missed. I'm still here.

01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:20.545
You're not that fucking good.

01:00:20.645 --> 01:00:24.316
<i>He speaks! Tear up the planks. Hear, hear.</i>

01:00:24.416 --> 01:00:27.019
<i>It is the beating of his hideous heart.</i>

01:00:27.519 --> 01:00:30.055
What's that, one of your gay-ass Hajji poems?

01:00:30.155 --> 01:00:33.160
<i>American. "Tell Tale Heart."</i>

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.995
<i>Edgar Allan Poe.</i>

01:00:37.095 --> 01:00:39.931
I didn't catch a fucking word
you're saying, man.

01:00:40.031 --> 01:00:42.301
<i>Edgar Allan Poe. Don't you...</i>

01:00:43.301 --> 01:00:45.871
What's wrong with your fucking
radio, man? What is that?

01:00:45.971 --> 01:00:47.973
<i>You must've studied his work.</i>

01:00:48.273 --> 01:00:50.342
<i>He's an American great.</i>

01:00:50.842 --> 01:00:52.878
<i>...writing is really...</i>

01:00:53.278 --> 01:00:56.348
What is it? Not doing a fucking thing.

01:00:56.448 --> 01:00:59.109
<i>Did you know that he was an orphan?</i>

01:01:00.218 --> 01:01:03.247
<i>He tried to be a soldier,
but didn't get very...</i>

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:10.392
Shane.

01:01:10.492 --> 01:01:13.939
- Shane, is that you?
- <i>He was a better writer than a soldier.</i>

01:01:17.136 --> 01:01:19.806
<i>"Once upon a midnight dreary...</i>

01:01:21.106 --> 01:01:24.546
<i>"...while I pondered, weak and weary...</i>

01:01:25.677 --> 01:01:27.813
- Sar'nt Matthews!
- <i>"Suddenly there came...</i>

01:01:27.913 --> 01:01:31.183
- <i>"...a tapping, rapping...</i>
- Is that you?

01:01:31.283 --> 01:01:33.553
<i>"...at my chamber door.</i>

01:01:34.386 --> 01:01:38.056
<i>"And there stepped a stately raven...</i>

01:01:38.856 --> 01:01:41.752
<i>...from the saintly days of yore."</i>

01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:46.698
<i>"Take thy beak from out of my heart...</i>

01:01:46.798 --> 01:01:49.668
<i>"...and take thy form from off my door.</i>

01:01:50.368 --> 01:01:53.597
<i>Quoth the raven, 'nevermore.'"</i>

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:02.440
<i>Or perhaps you would prefer Robert Frost?</i>

01:02:04.648 --> 01:02:06.451
<i>"A voice said...</i>

01:02:06.752 --> 01:02:08.848
<i>"'Look me in the stars...</i>

01:02:10.055 --> 01:02:13.306
- I see you, man!
- <i>"'...and tell me truly, men of Earth...</i>

01:02:13.406 --> 01:02:18.263
- I knew you were taking a nap!
- <i>"'...if all the soul and body scars...</i>

01:02:18.363 --> 01:02:21.423
- I found that fucking weasel.
- <i>"...were not too much...</i>

01:02:21.523 --> 01:02:25.772
- <i>"...to pay for birth."</i>
- 12 o'clock. In the fucking trash heap.

01:02:26.972 --> 01:02:29.587
<i>His poetry is so beautiful.</i>

01:02:40.351 --> 01:02:41.966
Fu...

01:02:47.224 --> 01:02:48.727
Shit.

01:02:48.827 --> 01:02:51.814
So, you studied?

01:02:53.864 --> 01:02:55.368
Studied...

01:02:55.868 --> 01:02:58.405
...you studied here or abroad?

01:03:00.105 --> 01:03:02.441
<i>Like, I know they got those...</i>

01:03:02.541 --> 01:03:04.699
<i>...study abroad programs or whatnot.</i>

01:03:07.712 --> 01:03:09.274
Shane!

01:03:10.012 --> 01:03:12.551
A shot from that distance,
he's got to be at least...

01:03:12.651 --> 01:03:15.455
...25, 30 feet up, man.

01:03:16.755 --> 01:03:20.035
We're talking 1,500 meters. 1,550 maybe.

01:03:21.401 --> 01:03:22.995
Right?

01:03:23.495 --> 01:03:26.758
Why ain't you talking, man?
Come on, you there?

01:03:28.232 --> 01:03:29.802
Fuck.

01:03:30.202 --> 01:03:31.763
Fuck.

01:03:35.106 --> 01:03:37.000
Are you there, man?

01:03:40.444 --> 01:03:44.082
It's just, you know... you know
a lot about books and shit.

01:03:44.182 --> 01:03:47.827
I just thought I might even learn
some Hajji Shakespeare or some shit.

01:03:49.587 --> 01:03:52.796
<i>Shakespeare? Is that the only poet you know?</i>

01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:58.334
<i>I studied English.</i>

01:03:59.797 --> 01:04:03.219
What, you... you minor
in sniping or something?

01:04:04.635 --> 01:04:08.340
<i>I was a teacher in Baghdad,
but a bomb hit my school.</i>

01:04:09.007 --> 01:04:11.444
Hey, you got it? Shane.

01:04:11.844 --> 01:04:14.412
<i>I got shrapnel in my left elbow. Still hurts.</i>

01:04:14.512 --> 01:04:17.316
Fucking trash heap behind the white trailer.

01:04:18.416 --> 01:04:22.187
- 1,550.
- <i>It reminds me of the students I lost.</i>

01:04:22.287 --> 01:04:26.340
Go on, baby. Go on, baby, let's do this.

01:04:27.592 --> 01:04:30.488
<i>Is that why you shoot civilian contractors?</i>

01:04:32.396 --> 01:04:35.034
<i>As the scripture says, an eye for an eye.</i>

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.470
That's bullshit.

01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:41.206
You're no more religious than I am, man.

01:04:41.506 --> 01:04:44.744
That's just a fucking excuse
to shoot up some Americans.

01:04:46.144 --> 01:04:47.980
You're good, man.

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:51.472
Just keep going slow, baby, real slow.

01:04:52.084 --> 01:04:55.321
- <i>Is that a question, Isaac?</i>
- Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

01:04:56.521 --> 01:04:59.151
Yeah, that's right.

01:05:03.928 --> 01:05:06.298
<i>You see, that's what I don't get.</i>

01:05:06.398 --> 01:05:10.628
<i>How's an educated person like you
become a fucking terrorist?</i>

01:05:13.405 --> 01:05:15.207
You tell me.

01:05:15.975 --> 01:05:18.177
Shut your fucking mouth.

01:05:18.377 --> 01:05:20.179
<i>You're fading, Isaac.</i>

01:05:21.179 --> 01:05:23.849
You like to hear yourself talk, don't you?

01:05:24.649 --> 01:05:26.697
I'm fucking fantastic.

01:05:27.719 --> 01:05:29.722
Chilling like a villain, baby.

01:05:30.322 --> 01:05:32.324
<i>You are not fantastic.</i>

01:05:32.624 --> 01:05:34.459
<i>You have no water.</i>

01:05:34.559 --> 01:05:36.395
<i>You're dehydrated.</i>

01:05:37.896 --> 01:05:41.145
<i>The sun is... the sun's baking you.</i>

01:05:44.768 --> 01:05:46.416
<i>You're bleeding to death.</i>

01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:01.353
Cap...

01:06:02.053 --> 01:06:03.255
Cap...

01:06:03.855 --> 01:06:06.458
- Captain Albright.
- <i>What's that?</i>

01:06:06.558 --> 01:06:08.393
A legend.

01:06:09.093 --> 01:06:11.355
Trained me. Trained Dean, too.

01:06:12.998 --> 01:06:14.833
He's coming for us.

01:06:14.933 --> 01:06:18.637
- <i>For your bodies.</i>
- When we don't report in, he's on your ass.

01:06:18.737 --> 01:06:21.727
<i>Judging from your and Matthews'
performances, I'm not concerned.</i>

01:06:21.827 --> 01:06:25.469
Fuck you. He's coming for us.

01:06:33.017 --> 01:06:34.829
He trained us.

01:06:36.488 --> 01:06:38.558
Trained us to survive.

01:06:39.758 --> 01:06:42.186
<i>And won't he be disappointed?</i>

01:06:44.927 --> 01:06:46.731
<i>You didn't win shit.</i>

01:06:47.831 --> 01:06:50.868
<i>You hear me, motherfucker?
You didn't win shit.</i>

01:06:55.472 --> 01:06:57.941
From a place you will not see...

01:06:58.276 --> 01:07:00.979
...comes a sound you will not hear.

01:07:01.079 --> 01:07:03.741
Just a flash of fucking light.

01:07:04.949 --> 01:07:06.535
Boom.

01:07:14.258 --> 01:07:16.892
<i>When I'm done with you and Matthews...</i>

01:07:16.992 --> 01:07:19.864
<i>...everyone will know who the winner is.</i>

01:07:37.481 --> 01:07:39.043
Shane!

01:07:41.752 --> 01:07:44.181
Hold still, man, hold still.

01:07:52.195 --> 01:07:54.366
<i>Should I take Sergeant Matthews' head off?</i>

01:07:54.466 --> 01:07:56.822
Shit. Hold still, man.

01:07:56.922 --> 01:08:00.138
- Don't fucking move.
- <i>Will you take something from Matthews?</i>

01:08:00.238 --> 01:08:02.273
<i>Like your broken scope?</i>

01:08:02.373 --> 01:08:04.837
<i>He's in my crosshairs right now.</i>

01:08:05.777 --> 01:08:07.646
I've got eyes on him.

01:08:08.246 --> 01:08:09.681
<i>What?</i>

01:08:09.781 --> 01:08:12.070
I don't make empty threats, Isaac.

01:08:12.750 --> 01:08:15.221
<i>I'm going to tear his face off.</i>

01:08:16.421 --> 01:08:18.055
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:08:18.156 --> 01:08:21.093
I carry around the scope
because it reminds me...

01:08:21.193 --> 01:08:24.617
...why I can't hold a sc...
hold a rifle again.

01:08:29.533 --> 01:08:31.036
Okay?

01:08:31.435 --> 01:08:33.307
You listening to me?

01:08:35.607 --> 01:08:37.475
Dean dropped it...

01:08:37.875 --> 01:08:41.279
...the scope, in the line of duty. He fell
over trying to pick it up and I missed...

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:44.817
...I missed the sniper, okay?
You fucking listening to me?

01:08:46.017 --> 01:08:49.046
I didn't see him.
That's how he got hit. It was my fault.

01:08:49.145 --> 01:08:51.133
Goddamn it, you fucking listening?

01:09:05.902 --> 01:09:09.107
No. Slower, man. Slower, slower.

01:09:09.207 --> 01:09:10.701
<i>Slower what?</i>

01:09:12.676 --> 01:09:14.564
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:09:17.715 --> 01:09:19.676
Who are you talking to?

01:09:24.322 --> 01:09:26.349
Who am I talking to?

01:09:27.207 --> 01:09:29.420
<i>I'm talking to fucking God!</i>

01:09:33.529 --> 01:09:35.667
He's 30 feet up...

01:09:35.767 --> 01:09:38.202
...in the trash somewhere!

01:09:38.301 --> 01:09:40.305
I don't fucking know.

01:09:40.404 --> 01:09:42.241
I'm sorry, man.

01:09:43.241 --> 01:09:45.389
Give me max plus four!

01:09:47.211 --> 01:09:49.359
Six mils right!

01:09:50.741 --> 01:09:52.551
Send when ready!

01:09:54.051 --> 01:09:55.579
Fuck.

01:10:03.461 --> 01:10:05.284
Did you get him?

01:10:07.331 --> 01:10:09.500
Please tell me you got him.

01:10:10.058 --> 01:10:12.871
- Fuck.
- Fuck!

01:10:12.971 --> 01:10:15.540
- You bastard. You fucking...
- Fuck me.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:18.196
Just fucking let him go, you piece of shit!

01:10:19.276 --> 01:10:21.680
Shane, get up, man!

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:25.318
He ain't a threat to you anymore.
Just fucking let him go.

01:10:25.418 --> 01:10:30.014
- Goddamn it. Fuck, fuck.
- Don't fucking stop! Don't fucking stop!

01:10:31.573 --> 01:10:35.836
Just like that. Just like that, baby.
Just go! Fuck. Come on, man!

01:10:35.936 --> 01:10:37.054
Move!

01:10:41.299 --> 01:10:43.875
Keep coming, man! You're almost there!

01:10:49.474 --> 01:10:51.969
Come on. Just like that, man.

01:10:53.684 --> 01:10:57.148
Reach for me. Reach for me!

01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:21.786
Why? Why?

01:11:34.151 --> 01:11:36.155
I want to go home!

01:11:36.755 --> 01:11:39.391
I want to go fucking home, motherfucker.

01:11:39.891 --> 01:11:42.827
<i>So go. Walk away.</i>

01:11:42.927 --> 01:11:46.114
- You'll just fucking shoot me.
- <i>No, I won't.</i>

01:11:46.214 --> 01:11:49.618
Yes, you fucking will. Why wouldn't you?

01:11:49.718 --> 01:11:52.120
<i>Because that's not really what you want.</i>

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.723
What?

01:11:54.723 --> 01:11:56.984
<i>You don't want to go home, do you?</i>

01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:01.064
The fuck's that mean, man?

01:12:02.764 --> 01:12:05.393
<i>The war's over. You're still here.</i>

01:12:09.503 --> 01:12:11.065
<i>Why?</i>

01:12:27.855 --> 01:12:29.717
I killed him.

01:12:32.359 --> 01:12:34.163
I did.

01:12:34.963 --> 01:12:36.999
He went to go confirm a kill.

01:12:37.499 --> 01:12:39.334
Enemy sniper.

01:12:39.434 --> 01:12:42.404
The guy was playing possum.
Started shooting at Dean.

01:12:42.504 --> 01:12:45.749
I tried shooting back,
but the bullet went right through Dean.

01:12:56.550 --> 01:13:00.243
Oh, man, I lied! I fucking lied so much!

01:13:02.423 --> 01:13:04.690
Trying to keep the story straight.

01:13:09.763 --> 01:13:11.800
I lied to everybody.

01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:15.963
I lied to every single person,
except you, a fucking Hajj!

01:13:40.562 --> 01:13:42.256
Are you there?

01:13:45.799 --> 01:13:49.000
You listening to me? Do you hear me?

01:13:50.571 --> 01:13:54.223
Where are you, man? Where do you keep going?

01:14:07.855 --> 01:14:09.716
No, something's off.

01:15:12.454 --> 01:15:15.856
<i>Spartan Thirty Three,
this is Mobile HQ Actual.</i>

01:15:17.859 --> 01:15:21.488
<i>Spartan Thirty Three,
this is Mobile HQ Actual.</i>

01:15:22.864 --> 01:15:25.834
This is Spartan 33! How copy?

01:15:25.934 --> 01:15:28.731
<i>Spartan 33 confirmed. Name and rank?</i>

01:15:28.831 --> 01:15:31.306
- Sar'nt A...
- <i>Sergeant Allen B. Isaac.</i>

01:15:32.774 --> 01:15:35.910
- <i>Good to hear you again, Sar'nt.</i>
- What the fuck?

01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:40.115
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Hey, Cap, Cap!
- <i>Any sign of the shooter in the last hour?</i>

01:15:40.215 --> 01:15:43.452
- <i>No, still quiet. We're chilling like villains.</i>
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:15:43.552 --> 01:15:47.485
- Cap, cap! This is Sar'nt Allen B. Isaac...
- <i>What's Matthews' status?</i>

01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:49.537
<i>He's stable, sir.</i>

01:15:50.057 --> 01:15:51.580
No, no!

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:55.029
- Captain Albright!
- <i>All due respect, Cap...</i>

01:15:55.129 --> 01:15:57.231
<i>...that's what y'all said an hour ago.</i>

01:15:57.331 --> 01:15:59.735
<i>Can I get an updated ETA?</i>

01:15:59.835 --> 01:16:03.338
- <i>ETA about an hour 20.</i>
- <i>Copy that.</i>

01:16:03.438 --> 01:16:06.008
- Fuck. Don't do this, man.
- <i>We're getting baked out here.</i>

01:16:06.108 --> 01:16:07.910
<i>Little out of it.</i>

01:16:19.454 --> 01:16:21.493
That guy called for us.

01:16:21.593 --> 01:16:23.425
<i>Fucking Hajjis.</i>

01:16:23.725 --> 01:16:26.419
<i>Just hoping you get here before nightfall.</i>

01:16:28.196 --> 01:16:31.291
How many times you done this,
you motherfucker?

01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:34.202
<i>Could've fooled me.</i>

01:16:37.105 --> 01:16:40.308
Construction guys call for security detail.

01:16:40.408 --> 01:16:43.011
Security detail calls for us, and I...

01:16:43.311 --> 01:16:45.780
- I call for them.
- <i>I hear that.</i>

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:50.518
- <i>We'll see you in 80...</i>
- Camouflage yourself in me, you fuck.

01:16:50.618 --> 01:16:53.680
<i>We'll do our best, Cap. Over and out.</i>

01:16:55.290 --> 01:16:58.151
- <i>Out.</i>
- Fuck you.

01:16:59.873 --> 01:17:01.755
Fuck you.

01:17:18.812 --> 01:17:20.850
Fuck off, will ya?

01:17:21.550 --> 01:17:23.444
Hey, damn it!

01:17:51.945 --> 01:17:54.174
Hey, you fucking there?

01:17:56.216 --> 01:17:58.820
You can't shoot them. You know that, right?

01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:01.389
You shoot, you give away your position.

01:18:01.989 --> 01:18:03.993
And they'll fucking find you.

01:18:05.193 --> 01:18:07.036
They will.

01:18:08.662 --> 01:18:10.524
You listening to me?

01:18:16.669 --> 01:18:18.565
You there?

01:20:15.822 --> 01:20:17.384
Fuck.

01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:22.055
I'm gonna shut you the fuck up.

01:21:46.946 --> 01:21:49.009
I ain't afraid of dyin'.

01:21:49.918 --> 01:21:52.359
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:23:10.630 --> 01:23:13.066
Spread out! Secure the perimeter!

01:23:13.835 --> 01:23:15.903
Casualty, 10 o'clock.

01:23:16.003 --> 01:23:18.718
Sergeant Isaac. All right, go, move it!

01:23:19.673 --> 01:23:22.709
- The trash. He's in...
- It's all gonna be okay.

01:23:23.077 --> 01:23:25.579
We got you. Just breathe.

01:23:25.679 --> 01:23:27.698
- He's in the trash.
- You're gonna be all right.

01:23:28.883 --> 01:23:30.911
All clear! Perimeter clear!

01:23:54.241 --> 01:23:56.477
<i>Bulldog 1-7, wheels up.</i>

01:23:56.577 --> 01:23:58.680
<i>3-5, wheels up.</i>

01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:01.094
<i>Bulldog flight is on the way.</i>

01:24:02.782 --> 01:24:05.819
<i>Coming right, heading 2-3-0.</i>

01:24:05.919 --> 01:24:07.780
<i>3-5, copy.</i>

01:24:13.593 --> 01:24:16.664
Try to relax, Sergeant.
You're gonna be all right.

01:24:23.636 --> 01:24:25.740
Just relax. Just relax.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:30.111
I've set up the oxygen. He's going through it
pretty fast so prep the backup tank.

01:24:30.211 --> 01:24:33.848
We'll reset in five mikes.
You got that? Five mikes.

01:24:34.548 --> 01:24:36.376
Copy that.

01:24:38.987 --> 01:24:41.722
- Holy shit!
- We're taking fire!

01:24:41.822 --> 01:24:44.669
- Where the fuck's it coming from?
- He's in the trash!

01:24:44.769 --> 01:24:46.127
Lie down! Lie down!

01:24:46.227 --> 01:24:48.062
- He's in the trash!
- What?

01:24:48.162 --> 01:24:50.798
- He's in the fucking trash!
- Hold on!

01:24:50.898 --> 01:24:53.192
He's in the trash!

01:25:00.641 --> 01:25:04.177
- Under fire! Under fire!
- Brace! Brace!

01:25:04.277 --> 01:25:07.892
Mayday, mayday, mayday! We're going down!

01:25:17.625 --> 01:25:21.662
