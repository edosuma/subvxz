WEBVTT

00:04.420 --> 00:06.588
Tell me about the months
without your brother.

00:06.756 --> 00:09.383
The things you and this demon bitch
do in the dark.

00:11.803 --> 00:14.930
Do you even know how far off
the reservation you've gone?

00:15.098 --> 00:16.974
How far from normal, from human?

00:17.892 --> 00:20.352
- Why do you trust her so much?
- She saved my life.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.484
You don't have the juice
to take me on, Sam.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.779
- Your abilities are getting flabby.
- How do I tone up?

00:30.947 --> 00:32.613
You know what you gotta do.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.449
- I'm not doing that anymore.
- Sam-

00:34.617 --> 00:35.909
I said no.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

00:44.544 --> 00:47.379
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:56.347 --> 00:59.474
- Charlier cut.
- Wow, you're really good.

00:59.642 --> 01:00.851
Yeah, great.

01:01.936 --> 01:04.396
- Hey, show us another.
- Finish your drink, Vance.

01:05.188 --> 01:07.566
This is a simple riffle shuffle.

01:12.363 --> 01:13.613
Do a card trick for me.

01:13.781 --> 01:16.450
Ooh, here we go. The Incredible Jay.

01:16.617 --> 01:19.703
All right, young lady,
would you please tell me when to stop?

01:19.871 --> 01:21.413
Stop.

01:22.498 --> 01:26.084
This is your card.
Commit it to memory. Hm?

01:26.461 --> 01:29.504
- That's incredible, Jay.
- Don't be a jerk.

01:29.672 --> 01:32.758
All right. Now, do you see your card?

01:33.259 --> 01:35.010
Um, no, I don't.

01:35.178 --> 01:38.096
No. The cards say no.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.766
- Check his pocket.
For God's sake.

01:41.267 --> 01:45.020
Well, just check-
Check the damn pocket.

01:45.188 --> 01:49.024
- So if you then would remove-
Ahem.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.070
This your card?

01:54.405 --> 01:57.783
Why are you so mean?
Can't you just leave the old guy alone?

02:10.630 --> 02:13.465
- Is he wearing eyeliner?
Wait, wait.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.760
Can't tell.
I'm blinded by all the sterling silver.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.553
The light has to find me.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.391
Get it? It has to find me.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.434
- What a douche bag.
- What a douche bag.

02:24.602 --> 02:27.062
Would you give it a rest?
You're giving me a headache.

02:27.230 --> 02:31.233
Come on, Jay, his misdirect is shaking
his ass like an 8th Avenue hooker.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.735
- Used to be about skill.
- Yeah, used to be.

02:33.903 --> 02:36.655
Listen to the two of you. It's pathetic.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.533
Bitter old men
talking about the glory days.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.828
You know what?
This douche bag isn't the joke.

02:43.955 --> 02:46.873
- We are.
- Hey, who you calling a joke?

02:48.501 --> 02:50.210
Me, for one.

02:55.299 --> 02:57.008
That used to be us.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.762
Maybe he is a douche bag,
but he's playing main stage...

03:00.930 --> 03:02.973
...and we can't even afford an assistant.

03:03.141 --> 03:06.268
- What the hell are we doing?
- We're doing all right.

03:06.436 --> 03:07.769
No, we're not.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.772
We're sad, we're old...

03:11.315 --> 03:12.816
...and we're dying.

03:12.984 --> 03:16.069
- Jay-
- I'm gonna do the Table of Death tonight.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.738
No. No, you're not, Jay.
Don't be crazy.

03:18.906 --> 03:21.992
You almost killed yourself last time.
That was 30 years ago.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.119
Who cares if it kills me?

03:24.287 --> 03:26.746
At least I'll go out with a headline.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.500
Ladies and gentlemen...

03:30.668 --> 03:34.880
...what you are about to see
is not a trick or an illusion.

03:35.047 --> 03:39.050
Simply a display of daring and dexterity.

03:47.810 --> 03:51.480
Now, young lady,
if you'll please check the bindings.

03:51.647 --> 03:53.315
You'll see they're very real.

03:54.442 --> 03:56.109
Very tight.

03:56.652 --> 03:59.946
Thank you. You may take your seat.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.034
Damn straight they're tight.

04:04.202 --> 04:06.328
You sure you can slip them?

04:46.369 --> 04:49.496
Show's in an hour, Vance.
Try to be on time.

04:49.664 --> 04:50.789
Pfft!

05:21.654 --> 05:23.029
Amazing!

05:57.231 --> 06:00.734
This isn't a trick, okay?
I don't do tricks.

06:00.901 --> 06:03.862
This is a demonstration...

06:04.030 --> 06:08.241
...about demons and angels,
love and lust.

06:08.409 --> 06:11.578
- What a douche bag.
All that stuff mixed up in my head.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.038
That's Jeb Dexter.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.833
I don't even wanna know
how you know that.

06:17.001 --> 06:20.086
- He's famous, kind of.
- For what?

06:20.254 --> 06:22.797
- Douche-baggery?
- No matter how messed up it gets...

06:22.965 --> 06:26.176
...don't touch me, okay?
For your own safety.

06:40.775 --> 06:44.152
Go back to hell, demon!

06:51.285 --> 06:53.203
Is this your card?

06:56.290 --> 06:59.542
You gotta be kidding me.
A fake demon possession?

07:02.713 --> 07:04.798
I can't believe people fall for that crap.

07:04.965 --> 07:06.049
It's not all crap.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.510
What part of that
was not a steaming pile of BS?

07:08.678 --> 07:11.554
Okay, that was crap,
but that's not all magicians.

07:11.722 --> 07:13.515
It takes skill.

07:13.891 --> 07:17.519
Oh, right, right. I forgot. You were
actually into this stuff, weren't you?

07:17.687 --> 07:19.729
You had, like,
a deck of cards and a wand-

07:19.897 --> 07:22.273
Dude, I was 13. It was a phase.

07:22.817 --> 07:25.318
It just bugs me.
Actually, it offends me.

07:25.486 --> 07:30.073
You know, playing at demons and magic
when the real thing will kill you bloody.

07:30.241 --> 07:33.702
Like a guy who drops dead of 10
stab wounds without a tear in his shirt?

07:33.869 --> 07:35.995
That's what I'm talking about.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.548
So did your boss have any enemies
that you know of?

07:46.716 --> 07:49.926
- Vance had plenty of enemies.
How so?

07:50.094 --> 07:52.846
He would steal from other magicians.
All the time.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.140
What would he steal?

07:55.307 --> 07:58.101
Stage effects, close-up techniques.

07:58.269 --> 08:01.646
- Anything he could get his hands on.
- Is that enough to get him killed?

08:02.231 --> 08:05.024
These guys take this stuff
pretty seriously.

08:05.484 --> 08:07.235
There you are.

08:10.948 --> 08:13.575
Did you find anything weird
in Vance's stuff?

08:13.743 --> 08:15.243
Well, weirder?

08:16.537 --> 08:18.621
Matter of fact, I did.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.423
I'm guessing
this didn't belong to Vance.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.593
He hated card tricks.
Never wanted them around...

08:31.761 --> 08:33.803
...let alone in his precious cape.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.241
You gonna tell me how you did it?

08:55.451 --> 08:57.202
Did what?

08:57.870 --> 08:59.204
You know what.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.248
The great ones
never give away the how.

09:02.416 --> 09:05.502
Yesterday you were sad, old and dying.

09:05.669 --> 09:07.837
Today you're one of the great ones?

09:08.005 --> 09:10.757
Come on, this is me you're talking to.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.635
You didn't think I could do it.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.554
No, Jay, I didn't.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.307
You're my friend. My best friend.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.810
I just didn't wanna see you get hurt,
that's all.

09:21.977 --> 09:24.521
Charlie, you wanna see something?

09:25.272 --> 09:26.815
Look at this.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.285
- Not bad.
- Not bad?

09:39.453 --> 09:42.956
I've been working to pull an ace
out of the middle of the deck for years.

09:43.123 --> 09:45.917
Just one. And now I can pull three.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.629
You're still missing the ace of hearts.

09:52.174 --> 09:55.218
I wanna do the Executioner tonight.

09:55.469 --> 09:59.097
- Are you trying to get yourself killed?
- It's just a rope slip.

09:59.515 --> 10:02.851
- Houdini wouldn't try the Executioner.
- Exactly.

10:03.018 --> 10:05.478
Think about it, Charlie.
If I can pull this off...

10:06.814 --> 10:09.065
I think you're pushing your luck.

10:09.733 --> 10:12.694
It wasn't luck. It wasn't.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.489
Here, stand over there.

10:17.032 --> 10:18.366
Let's not end up like this.

10:18.534 --> 10:22.829
A couple of old farts
doing birthdays and bar mitzvahs.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.875
It beats dying.

10:27.042 --> 10:28.751
Does it?

10:28.919 --> 10:31.588
I would do anything for you.
You know that.

10:31.755 --> 10:34.841
But I will not watch you die.

10:35.009 --> 10:38.636
- I'll miss that show.
- No, you'll be there.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.346
You're always there for me.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.683
Check your pocket.

10:51.817 --> 10:55.069
That's good, Jay.
That's pretty damn good.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.447
I can do it, Charlie.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.033
I wanna do it.

11:00.492 --> 11:02.160
Please.

11:09.418 --> 11:10.960
It's a lame gig.

11:11.128 --> 11:15.131
I'm in a fleabag hotel
doing this man-of-the-people crap...

11:15.299 --> 11:18.468
...and freaking Angel's in Vegas
doing Cirque du Soleil.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.596
That should have been mine.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.808
All right, boys. Get it in gear.
I don't got all day.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.645
- You Vernon Haskell?
- Who's asking?

11:30.230 --> 11:32.023
Federal Agent Ulrich.

11:32.650 --> 11:35.568
Looking into the death of Patrick Vance.

11:35.736 --> 11:39.364
I'm Jeb Dexter. This is Devil Twist.

11:39.531 --> 11:42.408
We're chilling at the International
Magician's Convention...

11:42.576 --> 11:44.702
...which is a dope chance to tip my hat...

11:44.870 --> 11:46.955
...to the wicked cats
who came before me.

11:47.122 --> 11:49.749
Smoking-hot effect last night, Jim.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.167
Jay.

11:51.710 --> 11:54.253
- Huh?
- My name, it's Jay.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.840
Yeah, whatever. We can loop it later.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.052
What a douche bag.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.430
Couldn't agree more.

12:04.848 --> 12:07.642
Is this familiar to you?

12:07.810 --> 12:09.936
I said we can loop it later.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.771
Should it be?

12:12.147 --> 12:14.649
Well, I heard that you use tarot cards
in your act.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.401
My act?

12:17.403 --> 12:18.778
That was a long time ago.

12:18.946 --> 12:21.864
I haven't touched a deck in years.
You know.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.243
Do you know someone
that might use them now?

12:25.411 --> 12:28.162
Well, there was a guy
down on Bleeker Street.

12:28.789 --> 12:32.208
Oh, yeah.
He peddles that kind of specialty stuff.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.335
Did he have a problem with Vance?

12:34.503 --> 12:38.423
Matter of fact,
Vance crossed him about a year ago.

12:38.590 --> 12:42.093
Probably cost 50 grand in royalties.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.972
- You know the exact address?
-426 Bleeker.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.141
- Ask for Chief.
- Chief?

12:48.308 --> 12:49.434
Mm-hm.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.519
Thank you.

13:19.339 --> 13:21.799
I'm here to see Chief.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.856
Stay here.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.275
Don't touch anything.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.723
You are really gonna get it tonight,
big boy.

14:13.477 --> 14:16.104
There's been a misunderstanding.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.689
I think I've been had.

14:18.857 --> 14:22.944
Oh, you ain't been had
till you've been had by the Chief.

14:25.572 --> 14:27.240
Oh, and before we get started...

14:28.534 --> 14:29.909
...what's your safe word?

14:55.894 --> 14:59.814
- What are you doing here, Ruby?
- I should be asking you the same thing.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.069
I'm working a job.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.488
The world's about to be engulfed
in hellfire...

15:07.656 --> 15:10.533
...and you're in Magic Town, U.S.A.?

15:11.118 --> 15:12.827
You got something against magic?

15:12.995 --> 15:16.706
That would almost be funny
if 34 seals hadn't been broken already.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.374
Thirty-four, Sam.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.711
That's over halfway.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.589
The angels are losing this war.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.133
Every day is one day closer...

15:27.301 --> 15:29.468
...and if someone
doesn't do something soon-

15:29.636 --> 15:31.304
- And that someone is me?
- Who else?

15:31.471 --> 15:34.348
I don't know where these seals are.
I don't know squat.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.685
So why don't you tell me
where to start?

15:37.853 --> 15:40.146
You can quit dicking around here
for one thing.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.939
Bigger fish, Sam.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.858
And if the seals are being broken...

15:44.026 --> 15:46.736
...you might wanna go after the one
doing the breaking.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.197
- Lilith?
- Cut the head off the snake.

15:50.115 --> 15:53.451
You're the only one
who can stop her, Sam.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.621
So step up and kill the little bitch.

15:56.788 --> 15:58.873
Oh, I'm game, believe me.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.334
It's not the psychic thing
I got a problem with.

16:01.501 --> 16:04.712
Yeah, I know what you got
a problem with, but tough.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.173
It's the only way.

16:10.344 --> 16:11.385
No.

16:11.553 --> 16:14.222
You know, this would all
be so much easier...

16:14.389 --> 16:17.391
...if you'd just admit to yourself
that you like it.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.103
That feeling that it gives you.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.941
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh, I don't, huh?

16:25.984 --> 16:27.068
Fine.

16:29.821 --> 16:33.115
It's simple.
Lucifer rises, the apocalypse starts.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.618
You think that you have demons
on your hands now?

16:35.786 --> 16:39.622
People are gonna die, Sam.
Oceans of people.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.043
So you just let me know
when you're ready.

16:55.889 --> 16:59.016
- Find anything interesting?
- What? Uh...

16:59.184 --> 17:01.185
No. You?

17:01.353 --> 17:04.313
Nothing I wanna talk about
or think about ever again.

17:07.358 --> 17:11.112
- He's crazy and you know it.
- He says he can do it.

17:11.280 --> 17:15.657
- Did you even try to talk him out of it?
- Till I was blue in the face.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.286
But I tell you, Vernon, there was...

17:18.954 --> 17:24.083
- There was something in his eyes.
- In his eyes? You're both nuts.

17:28.839 --> 17:32.425
- The Chief, huh?
- What's the matter? Chief not your type?

17:34.011 --> 17:36.304
I could have you both arrested
for obstruction.

17:36.471 --> 17:39.932
- How? You're no fed.
- Yeah, we con people for a living, son.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.643
It takes more than a fake badge
to get past us.

17:46.523 --> 17:50.234
You got us. Yeah, we are actually...

17:50.736 --> 17:52.320
...aspiring magicians.

17:52.487 --> 17:55.865
We came to the convention because
we thought we could learn something.

17:56.033 --> 17:59.201
- Get some ideas for our new show.
- Ooh, what kind of show?

17:59.369 --> 18:00.995
- It's a-
- It's a brother act.

18:01.163 --> 18:05.416
Yeah. Yeah, you know,
with the rings and doves...

18:05.584 --> 18:07.418
...and rings.

18:07.919 --> 18:09.712
Ladies and gentlemen...

18:09.880 --> 18:12.506
...I give you The Incredible Jay.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.008
You wanna learn something?

18:16.094 --> 18:17.136
Stick around.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.805
Ladies and gentlemen,
what you're about to witness...

18:19.973 --> 18:21.724
...is a feat so daring...

18:21.892 --> 18:25.728
...so dangerous, even the great Houdini
dared not attempt it.

18:25.896 --> 18:29.106
I give to you the Executioner.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.827
Now, sir, as you can see,
this jacket is the real article.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.750
Thank you, sir.
You may take your seat.

18:49.836 --> 18:54.215
Now, I will have one minute-
Sixty seconds.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.051
- to escape certain death.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.429
Let's see if I can do it.

19:48.019 --> 19:50.062
I don't think he's gonna make it.

20:03.034 --> 20:05.786
Ha! That was amazing.
That was freaking amazing.

20:06.413 --> 20:07.621
- That was...
Thank you.

20:07.789 --> 20:10.624
- ... not humanly possible.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

20:22.429 --> 20:25.264
Looks like this guy Jay
was a pretty big deal in the '70s.

20:25.432 --> 20:28.225
Which in magician land
means what, exactly?

20:28.393 --> 20:30.394
Big enough to play
Radio City Music Hall.

20:31.021 --> 20:33.772
What got him stuck
in where-are-they-now file?

20:34.566 --> 20:35.691
He got old.

20:39.237 --> 20:43.908
Okay, so maybe Incredible Jay
is using real magic to stage a comeback?

20:44.409 --> 20:47.745
It's possible. Some kind of spell
that works a death transference.

20:47.913 --> 20:51.707
- How does the tarot card mix into it?
- I don't know.

20:52.792 --> 20:54.376
Man.

20:55.962 --> 20:58.923
I hope I die before I get old.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.383
Whole thing seems brutal, don't it?

21:07.557 --> 21:10.434
- You think we will?
- What?

21:11.561 --> 21:13.395
Die before we get old.

21:14.064 --> 21:17.107
- Haven't we both already?
- You know what I mean, Dean. I mean...

21:17.275 --> 21:20.277
...do you think we'll still be
chasing demons when we're 60?

21:20.445 --> 21:24.114
No, I think we'll be dead. For good.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.660
What? You wanna end up
like Travis, huh?

21:27.827 --> 21:29.995
- Or Gordon, maybe?
- There's Bobby.

21:31.122 --> 21:34.333
Oh, yeah. There's a poster child
for growing old gracefully.

21:37.420 --> 21:38.921
Maybe we'll be different, Dean.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.925
What kind of Kool-Aid
you drinking, man?

21:43.510 --> 21:46.804
Sammy, it ends bloody or sad.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.138
That's just the life.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.648
- What if we could win?
- Win?

21:58.483 --> 22:00.651
If there was a way we could just...

22:01.319 --> 22:03.028
...put an end to all of it.

22:04.739 --> 22:06.699
- Is there something going on?
- No.

22:06.866 --> 22:09.994
- Sammy-
- No. Look, I'm just saying I-

22:10.870 --> 22:13.330
I just wish there was a way
we could...

22:13.540 --> 22:16.292
...go after the source, that's all.

22:17.168 --> 22:18.502
Cut the head off the snake.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.632
The problem with the snake
is that it has a thousand heads.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.635
Evil bitches just keep
piling out of the Volkswagen.

22:29.389 --> 22:30.848
Yeah.

22:31.850 --> 22:32.891
Guess you're right.

22:37.063 --> 22:39.857
Why don't you go see
if you can track down Jay?

22:40.775 --> 22:43.527
I'll see what I can dig up
on this tarot card.

22:51.369 --> 22:52.661
Hey.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.372
Some maid found Jeb
hanging from a ceiling fan.

22:55.540 --> 22:59.501
Police think it was a suicide.
I beg to differ.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.920
Pulled a little sleight of hand myself.

23:02.088 --> 23:03.380
On Dexter's body?

23:03.548 --> 23:06.050
I'm thinking if the spell
is a death transference...

23:06.217 --> 23:09.553
...then these cards work
like black-magic targets.

23:09.721 --> 23:12.931
- Any connection between the victims?
- Jeb was a douche bag to Jay.

23:13.099 --> 23:14.767
What about the first vict-? Vance?

23:14.934 --> 23:18.395
Asked around. Vance was heckling Jay
at the bar the day he was killed.

23:20.398 --> 23:24.068
Okay, so Jay sneaks a card into Vance's
pocket, does the Table of Death-

23:24.235 --> 23:26.737
And Vance takes 10 swords to the chest.

23:26.905 --> 23:30.199
Then Jay slips a noose and Jeb doesn't.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.868
- Hell of a trick.
- It's time we had a chat with Jay.

23:33.036 --> 23:34.953
Any luck tailing him?

23:35.538 --> 23:37.831
He slipped me.

23:38.416 --> 23:42.586
- He's a 60-year-old.
- He's a magician.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.569
- Up against the wall! Now!
- What do you want?

24:07.737 --> 24:09.238
We know what you've been up to.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.782
Working some bad mojo
to jump-start your act.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.243
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:14.411 --> 24:16.245
You put a spell on those tarot cards.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.789
- Messing with real magic?
- Real magic?

24:18.957 --> 24:21.291
- There's no such thing as real magic.
- Is that so?

24:21.459 --> 24:24.461
Yeah, believe me.
I've been around this stuff my whole life.

24:24.629 --> 24:28.257
It's illusions. It's tricks. It's-
It's all fake.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.468
Jeb Dexter strung up.
Was that just an illusion?

24:31.886 --> 24:35.180
- What? Something happened to Jeb?
- He was found hanged in his room.

24:35.390 --> 24:38.016
Right after you slipped the noose
last night.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.271
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.148
Please.

24:44.649 --> 24:45.941
Just let me go.

24:47.777 --> 24:48.944
Something's not right.

24:50.447 --> 24:53.949
Usually they're whipping
some badass hoodoo at us by now.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.326
What do you wanna do?

24:58.788 --> 25:03.167
- All right. So if it's not him, who is it?
- Even if Jay's not working the magic...

25:03.334 --> 25:06.545
...he's still getting the reward.
His shows are selling out.

25:06.921 --> 25:08.338
All right.

25:08.506 --> 25:12.342
So then whoever it is,
they're obviously in Jay's corner.

25:12.510 --> 25:15.471
All right, so we got Vernon and Charlie
on the list. Anyone else?

25:15.638 --> 25:17.181
Uh...

25:17.724 --> 25:19.725
We could always ask him.

25:23.688 --> 25:28.066
- I guess we should've seen that coming.
- Come on. He couldn't have gotten far.

25:42.332 --> 25:45.501
- No way he could outrun us.
- Maybe he vanished. He really is good.

25:45.668 --> 25:46.877
Or he found a back door.

25:52.008 --> 25:55.552
That's them. Those are the two nutjobs
that just broke into my room.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.471
Freeze. Hands where I can see them.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.691
They said my act is killing people.

26:09.859 --> 26:14.238
They said that I was using real magic,
that I was casting spells on tarot cards.

26:14.405 --> 26:16.657
Real magic? Those guys are nuts.

26:17.450 --> 26:19.451
You're lucky to be alive.

26:20.578 --> 26:22.079
You don't think...?

26:23.957 --> 26:26.875
- What?
- The things I can do now. The cards-

26:27.043 --> 26:29.211
You've been working the cards
your whole life.

26:29.379 --> 26:30.754
Well, what about the escapes?

26:30.964 --> 26:33.715
I haven't been able to slip a pair of cuffs
in 30 years.

26:33.883 --> 26:36.260
Then there was the way
that Patrick Vance died.

26:36.427 --> 26:39.429
- And that Jeb Dexter.
- No great loss there.

26:39.597 --> 26:42.432
- He didn't deserve to die.
- You had nothing to do with it.

26:42.600 --> 26:45.602
He was hanged the same night
that I performed the Executioner.

26:45.770 --> 26:49.690
Wait a minute. Are you telling me
that you actually believe those guys?

26:49.858 --> 26:52.442
That there was some kind
of real magic involved?

26:52.610 --> 26:54.111
No.

26:55.738 --> 26:58.782
I don't know. I don't- Maybe.

27:00.493 --> 27:02.578
I shouldn't go on tonight, Charlie.

27:02.745 --> 27:04.705
Are you kidding me?

27:04.873 --> 27:08.250
You have a sold-out house out there.
Sold out.

27:08.418 --> 27:10.794
When was the last time
that happened?

27:16.759 --> 27:18.635
The other night...

27:19.554 --> 27:24.391
...when I was doing the Table of Death,
I was...

27:27.312 --> 27:28.812
I was gonna kill myself.

27:30.315 --> 27:34.151
And I have no idea how I got out alive.

27:38.489 --> 27:39.740
But you did.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.618
Somehow, you did.

27:43.661 --> 27:44.661
Jay...

27:45.788 --> 27:48.123
...when you were in your day...

27:48.291 --> 27:49.958
...you were incredible.

27:50.543 --> 27:54.838
The Incredible Jay,
you were the best I ever saw.

27:55.465 --> 27:57.174
And now you got it back.

27:58.134 --> 28:01.136
I don't know how,
but it doesn't matter.

28:01.304 --> 28:04.932
Just to see you
at the top of your game again...

28:05.099 --> 28:06.934
...hell, it makes me feel young.

28:07.101 --> 28:09.519
- But-
- No buts, Jay.

28:10.480 --> 28:13.607
This may be manna from heaven.
I don't know.

28:14.609 --> 28:19.821
But whatever it is,
you don't throw it away.

28:49.560 --> 28:52.312
- How is he gonna get out?
- I don't know.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.424
Oh, my God! Somebody call 911!

29:20.591 --> 29:22.259
What?
I don't know.

29:38.234 --> 29:39.776
Jay.

29:40.445 --> 29:44.364
- Thanks for dropping the charges.
- You mind telling us why you did it?

29:46.242 --> 29:47.576
We have to talk.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.082
I was just a kid when we first met.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.793
All I knew was how to cheat at cards.

29:56.961 --> 29:59.963
Charlie got me out of more scrapes
than I can count.

30:03.468 --> 30:07.429
I would have been dead by the age of 20
if it hadn't been for him.

30:09.974 --> 30:12.726
He was more than my friend.

30:13.478 --> 30:14.770
He was my brother.

30:16.814 --> 30:17.981
I'm sorry, Jay.

30:18.649 --> 30:22.652
I should have listened to you when you
told me that my show was killing people.

30:22.820 --> 30:25.280
Well, you weren't the one
pulling the trigger.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.657
But someone did.
I wanna find out who did this.

30:27.825 --> 30:32.204
So I'll do whatever you guys say.
Just tell me what to do.

30:33.122 --> 30:35.624
Jay, whoever's doing this...

30:36.667 --> 30:38.502
...they like you.

30:38.711 --> 30:40.796
They're probably close to you.

30:42.298 --> 30:44.174
Did Charlie and Vernon get along?

30:45.218 --> 30:49.012
No. No, it's not Vernon.

30:49.472 --> 30:51.807
He's the only one that makes sense.

30:53.351 --> 30:57.020
- Charlie and Vernon were your family.
- And now Charlie's gone.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.647
Yeah, but...

30:59.357 --> 31:00.857
They butted heads sometimes...

31:01.025 --> 31:03.944
...but Vernon could never
do something like this.

31:05.738 --> 31:08.198
See, the thing about real magic...

31:08.366 --> 31:10.951
...is it's a whole lot like crack.

31:11.285 --> 31:14.621
People do surprising things
once they get a taste of it.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.876
You better be damn sure about this.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.797
Vernon is all I got left.

31:32.890 --> 31:34.641
Yeah?

31:35.017 --> 31:36.685
Okay.

31:37.311 --> 31:40.897
Yeah, okay. I'll be there in two shakes.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.567
I got something to tell you anyway.

32:05.923 --> 32:09.676
Wow. It's like a magic museum.

32:09.844 --> 32:12.012
You must be in heaven.

32:12.305 --> 32:13.722
This guy didn't travel light.

32:13.890 --> 32:17.434
He's been on the road his whole life.
Everything he owns is in this room.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.394
Let's get started.

32:31.949 --> 32:33.950
Just talked to the head
of the convention.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.828
Headliner gig is yours.

32:40.708 --> 32:41.750
What?

32:42.919 --> 32:43.960
You don't want it?

32:46.297 --> 32:50.467
A day ago, if you told me
I'd be standing on this stage...

32:52.261 --> 32:55.931
- No, I can't do it, Vernon.
- What are you talking about?

32:57.475 --> 32:59.601
Charlie's gone.

32:59.769 --> 33:02.812
Charlie would have wanted you
to go on. This is your shot.

33:02.980 --> 33:04.648
It's our shot.

33:06.108 --> 33:07.275
Really?

33:07.985 --> 33:10.779
This is what Charlie
would have wanted?

33:11.405 --> 33:13.365
Charlie's dead.

33:14.116 --> 33:17.369
Hey, he was my friend too, you know.

33:17.828 --> 33:22.666
- A hell of a way to treat a friend.
- Again, what are you talking about?

33:23.125 --> 33:26.628
You killed him, didn't you? And for what?

33:26.796 --> 33:30.131
So that I-?
So that we could be back on top?

33:30.299 --> 33:32.175
That's insane.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.844
- No, you're scaring me.
- First it was Vance.

33:35.012 --> 33:38.431
Then it was Jeb Dexter. Even if you
thought you were doing it for me...

33:39.267 --> 33:42.018
...how in God's name
could you kill Charlie?

33:42.645 --> 33:44.187
Oh, you are crazy.

33:44.397 --> 33:48.650
You used me.
And you used my act to do this to him.

33:48.818 --> 33:51.361
- If you think-
I wouldn't be so hard on him, Jay.

33:51.529 --> 33:53.280
He didn't do it.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.619
It's just a bunch of old-timey
magic stuff. None of it magic.

33:59.787 --> 34:03.123
No herbs, no candles and no tarot cards.

34:08.545 --> 34:10.964
- I'll be damned.
- What?

34:13.426 --> 34:14.717
Look like anyone we know?

34:18.054 --> 34:21.224
Sweet Mary and Joseph.

34:23.686 --> 34:24.728
Charlie?

34:31.277 --> 34:33.110
It's really me, Jay.

34:34.739 --> 34:35.905
How the hell-?

34:36.072 --> 34:39.284
God, you forget what it feels like
to be young.

34:40.328 --> 34:43.330
- It's amazing.
- How old are you?

34:43.496 --> 34:47.500
It depends on what you mean by old.
Right now, technically, about 28.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.960
But I've been around
a lot longer than that.

34:50.920 --> 34:52.172
How long?

34:52.797 --> 34:55.342
Long enough to have shilled for Barnum.

34:55.509 --> 34:56.717
And he gave me something.

34:56.927 --> 34:58.428
- What's that?
- The grimoire.

34:58.971 --> 35:00.138
A book of real magic.

35:01.265 --> 35:04.517
I thought it was a scam,
but I tried one of the spells. It worked.

35:04.685 --> 35:06.519
In fact, they all worked.

35:06.687 --> 35:09.731
So when I got to the end
and there was one for immortality...

35:09.940 --> 35:12.734
My God, Charlie.

35:12.943 --> 35:15.737
- And my show, the things I can do-
- Different spell.

35:15.946 --> 35:18.948
But it gives you a little taste
of what's possible.

35:22.203 --> 35:26.456
I wouldn't touch those, Vernon.
They're still radioactive.

35:28.292 --> 35:31.002
You killed Vance and Jeb Dexter.

35:31.170 --> 35:33.129
What, you think this is a parlor game?

35:33.297 --> 35:36.341
You were being humiliated
by those punks.

35:36.509 --> 35:38.843
A washed-up old man
who couldn't defend himself.

35:39.011 --> 35:41.638
You used me
to do these terrible things.

35:41.806 --> 35:43.807
I used them to give you a gift.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.477
And you wanted it, Jay.
I saw it in your eyes.

35:49.105 --> 35:52.399
- No, I never wanted this.
- You were ready to kill yourself.

35:53.234 --> 35:57.237
- I saved your life.
- Is that right, Jay?

35:57.988 --> 36:01.074
I was there for you,
like I've always been.

36:02.493 --> 36:04.619
Like I'll always be.

36:04.787 --> 36:06.704
Come with me, both of you.

36:06.872 --> 36:09.707
You think the first time was good?
Second time's even better.

36:09.875 --> 36:12.502
All the know-how,
none of the aches and pain.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.258
No. I won't do this. I won't.

36:18.426 --> 36:20.093
I've never made this offer before.

36:20.261 --> 36:23.430
Then again, I've never had friends
like the two of you before.

36:24.014 --> 36:26.015
Let me do this for you.

36:26.809 --> 36:30.019
And who else has to die
so that we can live forever?

36:31.522 --> 36:33.815
What's the price tag on immortality?

36:34.024 --> 36:36.609
This isn't right, what you're doing.
You know that.

36:36.777 --> 36:39.112
Somewhere you know that.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.031
I know I don't wanna
come back alone...

36:42.199 --> 36:44.868
...to start all over alone.

36:45.619 --> 36:47.036
Jay...

36:47.663 --> 36:49.330
...we can be young again.

36:49.540 --> 36:52.709
The three of us, together,
vital and alive.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.586
Forever.

36:54.753 --> 36:55.837
Not so fast.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.674
I ain't Guttenberg and this ain't Cocoon.

37:09.852 --> 37:12.479
Immortality. That's neat trick.

37:12.646 --> 37:13.813
It's not a trick.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.274
It's magic.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.073
Hey, bullet catch. Been working on that.

37:25.951 --> 37:27.118
Get him.

37:30.331 --> 37:32.332
Let him go! Now!

37:32.500 --> 37:35.627
- Just leave me and my friends alone.
I said now!

37:35.794 --> 37:38.171
All right, I will give it up.
The spells, hexes.

37:38.339 --> 37:39.923
This is the last time. I promise.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.355
Jay.

38:41.026 --> 38:43.820
You picked these strangers over me?

39:06.176 --> 39:09.053
- You okay?
- Yeah.

39:09.221 --> 39:11.055
Yeah, I'm all right.

39:42.838 --> 39:44.464
Hey, Jay.

39:47.217 --> 39:51.554
We wanted to thank you
for what you did yesterday.

39:52.306 --> 39:55.725
I killed my best friend yesterday,
and you wanna thank me?

40:02.941 --> 40:04.734
- Where's Vernon?
- Oh, he's gone.

40:04.943 --> 40:09.155
He said he didn't wanna speak to me
again after what I did to Charlie.

40:11.992 --> 40:13.242
Listen, Jay.

40:13.827 --> 40:16.871
You know Charlie was never gonna
give up what he was doing.

40:17.039 --> 40:18.331
Ever.

40:18.499 --> 40:22.418
- You did the right thing.
- You sure about that?

40:22.586 --> 40:24.587
You know, Charlie was like my brother.

40:26.256 --> 40:28.049
And now he's dead.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.593
Because I did the right thing.

40:32.596 --> 40:36.891
He offered me a gift,
and I just threw it back in his face.

40:39.103 --> 40:42.730
So now I have to spend
the rest of my life old and alone.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.196
What's so right about that?

40:55.285 --> 40:56.786
Jay...

40:57.413 --> 40:58.621
...your cards.

41:02.084 --> 41:03.292
Throw them away.

41:12.803 --> 41:16.889
Well, I don't know about you,
but I could go for a beer.

41:19.518 --> 41:21.060
I'm gonna take a walk.

41:43.459 --> 41:46.669
Okay. I'm in.

41:51.258 --> 41:53.259
What changed your mind?

41:55.179 --> 41:57.472
I don't wanna be doing this
when I'm an old man.
