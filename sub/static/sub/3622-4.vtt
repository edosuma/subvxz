Kim, it's about the Ron factor.
I know.

Is it the most ridiculous thing
in the history of <i>ever,</i> or what?

Actually, I think Global Justice
might be on to something.

supposed to be a super-genius.

09:04.511 --> 09:07.445

10:14.413 --> 10:16.181
Sorry! Ron factor!

10:17.416 --> 10:19.150
( <i>crashing</i>) ( <i>squealing</i>)

10:19.152 --> 10:21.753
( <i>grunting</i>) Dude...

10:21.755 --> 10:23.188
any damage?

10:23.190 --> 10:24.789
No, I'm fine.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.358
Is that a Greek letter?

10:27.293 --> 10:28.627
You know of...

10:28.629 --> 10:30.362
Fraternity boy, huh?

10:30.364 --> 10:33.164
( <i>chanting</i> ):
Toga, toga, toga...

10:33.166 --> 10:34.666
Classic Ron factor scenario.

10:34.668 --> 10:37.335
It's almost as if the whole
thing was an accident.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.504
There are no accidents
in our business.

10:40.906 --> 10:43.208
( <i>beeping</i> ):
Agent Delta...

10:43.210 --> 10:44.209
which aspect

10:44.211 --> 10:46.311
of stealth eludes you?

10:46.313 --> 10:48.913
Sorry, sir. I'll switch
to the brute force approach.

10:48.915 --> 10:51.883
Why don't you have a seat
instead?

10:51.885 --> 10:54.252
Yeah, I will sit down.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.321
On that bench over there.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.622
( <i>whistling</i>)

10:57.624 --> 11:00.291
( <i>screaming</i> )

11:00.293 --> 11:02.427
Holy...! Did you see that?

11:02.429 --> 11:03.728
Gemini.

11:03.730 --> 11:07.298
Time to take over
this operation... personally.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.567
Ooh, yes, Pepe.
( <i>whimpering</i>)

11:09.569 --> 11:13.805
Time to take over
this operation... personally.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.306
I don't know, Monique.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.675
Ron's my best, best friend.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.576
I wouldn't freak
fight without him.

11:18.578 --> 11:21.246
But does that make him
the secret to my success?

11:21.248 --> 11:22.380
What do you think?

11:22.382 --> 11:24.349
I don't know what
to think anymore.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.316
The top!

11:25.318 --> 11:27.652
Oh, it's really cute on you.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.954
Kim, you got it all
going on, okay?

11:29.956 --> 11:32.824
If "factor boy" gets
a little confidence from this,

11:32.826 --> 11:33.758
no foul, right?

11:33.760 --> 11:35.360
Kim-bo.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.002
The Ron factor's moving on
to Bueno Nacho.

11:37.797 --> 11:39.397
Girlfriend.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.433
Nice top...

11:41.435 --> 11:42.567
for my grandma.

( <i>rim shot</i> )

11:43.937 --> 11:45.270
( <i>both laughing</i>)

11:45.272 --> 11:47.872
Kim... do what
you got to do, girl.

11:48.674 --> 11:49.774
Chimurrito combo, Ned.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.309
Grande size.

11:52.311 --> 11:54.312
17 Chimurrito combos, please.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.347
Grande size.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.583
What Ron eats, GJ eats.

11:58.585 --> 11:59.784
Dig it.

11:59.786 --> 12:01.753
GEMINI:
I'll take him...

12:01.755 --> 12:02.721
to go.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.756
Hey! Hands off
the merchandise!

12:06.959 --> 12:08.326
Gemini.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.894
Huh. It's
been so long.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.663
Not long enough.

12:11.665 --> 12:13.298
You two know each other?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.400
Oh, we go way back.

12:16.502 --> 12:17.969
Hmm?

12:17.971 --> 12:19.537
Ow!

12:19.539 --> 12:20.905
( <i>Rufus whimpering</i> )
Nice try, buddy.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.474
You're surrounded, Gemini.

12:22.476 --> 12:23.541
( <i>Ron yells</i> )

12:23.543 --> 12:24.542
Talk to the hand.

12:29.782 --> 12:30.815
( <i>grunts</i> )

12:34.987 --> 12:35.954
Aah!

12:35.956 --> 12:37.489
( <i>yelling</i> )

12:38.390 --> 12:39.491
( <i>grunts</i> )

12:40.926 --> 12:42.827
Let me go!

12:42.829 --> 12:43.962
Ron?

12:43.964 --> 12:45.530
Borrowing.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.665
This, too. Sorry.

12:55.608 --> 12:56.908
( <i>electrical crackling</i>)

12:56.910 --> 12:58.676
( <i>electrical zapping</i> )

12:58.678 --> 13:02.380
That will deactivate
the tracking sensors.

13:06.018 --> 13:07.886
( <i>metal grinding</i> )

13:11.390 --> 13:13.958
You obviously don't know
who you're dealing with, pal.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.293
Yeah.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.728
Ron Stoppable.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.030
Okay, one for you.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.432
AKA the Ron factor.

13:21.434 --> 13:25.570
The latest top secret project
of Global Justice.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.072
( <i>yipping</i> )

13:33.813 --> 13:34.846
Who is that?

13:34.848 --> 13:36.381
RON:
Kim Possible.

13:36.383 --> 13:37.682
This is where she saves me

13:37.684 --> 13:39.517
and we beat you bad.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.586
It's a Ron factor thing.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.088
( <i>electrical crackling</i>)

13:44.757 --> 13:45.390
( <i>gasps</i> )

13:45.392 --> 13:46.057
Kim!

13:46.059 --> 13:47.892
That's a bad guy thing.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.828
( <i>yelling</i> )

13:49.830 --> 13:50.862
( <i>yelling continues</i> )

13:51.831 --> 13:53.698
( <i>Kim grunts</i> )

13:53.700 --> 13:54.966
Eew.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.901
Grande sized. Hmm.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.736
You grande sized?

13:58.738 --> 14:00.772
Well, I didn't foresee this,
obviously.

14:00.774 --> 14:02.674
Right. Sorry.

14:03.442 --> 14:04.375
( <i>sighs</i> )

14:04.377 --> 14:05.410
KIM:
<i>They're gone.</i>

14:05.412 --> 14:06.544
DIRECTOR:
<i>On their way</i>

14:06.546 --> 14:07.812
to WEE headquarters, no doubt.

14:07.814 --> 14:08.913
"WEE"?

14:08.915 --> 14:11.516
The Worldwide Evil Empire.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.818
Also known as WEE.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.086
It's an acronym.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.654
Acronym. Hmm.

14:16.656 --> 14:17.956
Yeah, that's a school word.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.657
I should know this.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.660
I am Gemini!

14:22.662 --> 14:25.630
Dude, I am Virgo,
but what's your name?

14:25.632 --> 14:26.464
Gemini.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.933
Oh! It's an acronym.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.468
Okay.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.704
You are fascinating.

14:32.706 --> 14:33.972
Guilty as charged, G.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.406
( <i>grunting</i> )

14:35.408 --> 14:36.674
( <i>gasps</i> )

14:36.676 --> 14:37.809
( <i>growling</i>)

14:37.811 --> 14:39.677
( <i>growling</i> )

14:39.679 --> 14:42.513
So, uh, what's the deal
with you and Dr. Director?

14:42.515 --> 14:44.949
I am her evil twin.

14:44.951 --> 14:46.784
But-but... but she's a "she."

14:46.786 --> 14:48.119
Fraternal twins.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.854
School word.

14:49.856 --> 14:54.959
I am her dark reflection,
her evil opposite in every way.

14:54.961 --> 15:00.031
So if she wants the Ron factor,
you must be totally <i>not</i> into it.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.733
Oh, you're good.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.435
That's why GJ
is in the Ron business.

15:04.437 --> 15:07.105
Ah, but it is I who have you.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.641
Maybe that's part of my plan.

15:09.643 --> 15:10.608
Really?

15:10.610 --> 15:11.943
Is this...

15:11.945 --> 15:13.811
also part of your plan?

15:13.813 --> 15:14.946
( <i>gasps</i> )

Huh?

15:16.883 --> 15:17.782
( <i>gasps</i> )

15:17.784 --> 15:19.817
Um... yes.

15:19.819 --> 15:21.786
Know this.

15:21.788 --> 15:25.723
I will stop at nothing
to possess the Ron factor.

15:26.692 --> 15:27.959
( <i>gasps</i> )

15:27.961 --> 15:29.160
Nothing?

15:29.995 --> 15:32.764
Nothing.

15:36.135 --> 15:37.168
Status report.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.736
No sign.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.905
Our satellite network
is searching the entire planet.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.573
Who <i>are</i> these people?

15:42.575 --> 15:43.975
The Worldwide Evil Empire

15:43.977 --> 15:45.743
is a shadow organization
working to foment

15:45.745 --> 15:47.645
lawlessness and chaos
( <i>baby crying</i>)

15:47.647 --> 15:48.947
around the globe.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.015
This is their leader, Gemini.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.016
My evil twin.

15:52.018 --> 15:53.484
Get... out!

15:53.486 --> 15:54.752
Fraternal?

15:54.754 --> 15:55.987
Exactly.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.622
Gemini's always resented
the fact

15:57.624 --> 15:59.490
that I didn't treat him
like an older brother.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.858
But you're twins.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.794
He's older...
by four minutes.

16:02.796 --> 16:03.928
Four minutes, four years.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.596
The point is,

16:05.598 --> 16:08.766
I am the older brother,
and she never respected that!

16:08.768 --> 16:12.036
Don't know that I agree,
but I admire your passion.

16:12.038 --> 16:13.738
Dr. Director!

16:13.740 --> 16:16.975
( <i>gasps</i> ):
A fly-on-the-wall cam.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.743
That is so Gemini.

16:18.745 --> 16:21.813
Wade, is it still sending
any kind of signal?

16:21.815 --> 16:22.847
Let me see it.

16:22.849 --> 16:23.848
Anything?

16:23.850 --> 16:25.516
I'm getting something.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.085
It's faint.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.887
Got it! The North Atlantic.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.489
I want to know exactly

16:31.491 --> 16:34.058
what the Ron factor is,
and I want to know now!

16:34.060 --> 16:36.127
Amp down, ain't no secret.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.162
The Ron factor is me.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.131
It's all about the intangibles.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.666
Hmm.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.167
Then you must join me.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.870
That will show my little sister.

Alpha for someone special.

but I-I...

Join me or be obliterated.

quite persuasive.

should be right here.

and you can have
all the Chimurritos you like.

18:08.021 --> 18:11.189

18:13.158 --> 18:15.126
You'd put that in
writing, of course.

Why do you want the Ron factor
so badly?

19:33.106 --> 19:35.907
Because...
( <i>stammers</i> )

19:35.909 --> 19:37.241
Because it's none
of your beeswax.

19:37.243 --> 19:39.877
You want it because I have it.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.179
You always wanted my stuff!

Well, baby sister, let's
see what Mom recalls.

You're the baby,

19:56.863 --> 19:59.397
Fine. Fine!

19:59.399 --> 20:01.732
We'll settle this
like grown-ups.

20:04.102 --> 20:06.070
Oh, that's mature.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.139
( <i>grunts</i> )

20:21.186 --> 20:23.287
( <i>both gasping</i>)

20:24.990 --> 20:26.157
( <i>high-pitched whistling</i> )

20:26.159 --> 20:27.992
( <i>grunts</i> )
K.P.!

20:27.994 --> 20:29.060
( <i>alarm blaring</i> )

20:29.062 --> 20:30.361
The place is going to blow!

20:33.899 --> 20:35.199
( <i>beeping</i> )

20:38.303 --> 20:40.438
Pepe!

20:41.506 --> 20:43.908
Come with me, Ron Stoppable.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.043
You will be my Agent Alpha!

20:46.045 --> 20:49.213
Together, we will crush
Global Justice.

20:49.215 --> 20:51.415
Oops, sorry, Pepe. Pepe?

20:51.417 --> 20:53.417
( <i>Rufus laughs,</i>
<i>blows raspberries</i> )

20:53.419 --> 20:54.852
( <i>grunts</i> )

20:54.854 --> 20:56.520
Where is my Pepe?

20:56.522 --> 20:59.523
( <i>whimpering</i> )

21:02.227 --> 21:04.328
RON:
Finger-cuff attack!

21:04.330 --> 21:06.831
Let's see you get out
of that, big bruh.

21:06.833 --> 21:10.001
( <i>straining</i>): You think
you can stop... Gemini?

21:10.003 --> 21:12.003
( <i>electrical zapping</i> )

21:12.005 --> 21:13.371
( <i>screaming</i>)

21:13.373 --> 21:15.072
( <i>teeth chattering</i> )

21:16.942 --> 21:18.876
Boo-yah!

21:18.878 --> 21:21.345
( <i>squeaky laughing</i> )

21:21.347 --> 21:23.114
( <i>explosion</i> )

21:23.116 --> 21:25.883
( <i>alarm sounding</i> )

21:25.885 --> 21:27.385
The Ron factor.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.919
Amazing.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.354
Correction, Dr. D.

21:30.356 --> 21:31.455
The Kim factor.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.357
With just a little
splash of Ron.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.960
Oh, Ron, that's so sweet.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.028
( <i>screams</i> )

21:38.430 --> 21:39.463
Let's move!

21:39.465 --> 21:41.065
KIM:
Right. Going.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.067
( <i>Pepe squeaking</i> )

21:43.069 --> 21:45.102
( <i>engine accelerating</i>)

21:54.980 --> 21:57.181
Status report?

21:57.183 --> 21:58.582
Project analysis is complete.

21:58.584 --> 21:59.950
The Ron factor

21:59.952 --> 22:01.619
is a non-factor.

22:01.621 --> 22:03.154
Well, there's a whole bunch

22:03.156 --> 22:04.855
of research dollars
down the drain.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.190
Not exactly...
the data revealed

22:06.192 --> 22:07.525
a powerful untapped force.

22:07.527 --> 22:08.926
We call it...

22:08.928 --> 22:10.161
the Rufus factor!

22:10.163 --> 22:12.863
( <i>grunting</i> )

22:12.865 --> 22:14.465
Hi-ya!

22:14.467 --> 22:17.368
( <i>laughing</i> )
