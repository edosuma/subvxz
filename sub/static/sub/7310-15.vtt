WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.300
- Cut around! Cut around!
- Back, back, back!

00:08.500 --> 00:09.700
Pick him up!

00:10.100 --> 00:12.700
- Good shot, Captain, let's go...
- Ball out, ball out.

00:12.900 --> 00:14.900
What you got, Captain?

00:15.200 --> 00:15.965
Hey!

00:16.000 --> 00:17.100
When you gonna go?

00:17.200 --> 00:18.600
Out of my way, Jimmy boy.

00:19.500 --> 00:20.800
This is what I call

00:20.900 --> 00:22.200
the halfcourt martial.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.400
- No, no way!
- Our ball, come on. Let's go guys!

00:36.800 --> 00:38.037
Damn Green Zone.

00:38.379 --> 00:39.879
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:40.106 --> 00:42.406
They should rename
it the free-fire zone.

00:45.613 --> 00:46.913
Where's the captain?

00:50.013 --> 00:51.013
Captain!

00:52.613 --> 00:53.713
Captain.

00:54.613 --> 00:55.413
No.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.713
- Get a corpsman!
- Corpsman!

00:59.232 --> 01:00.532
Damn.

01:32.213 --> 01:33.713
For the one you got me last week.

01:34.113 --> 01:35.313
Thank you.

01:38.113 --> 01:39.813
That is quite a kiss, McGee.

01:40.013 --> 01:41.713
Not bad for a wallpaper?

01:42.113 --> 01:44.013
Well, you seem to be enjoying yourself.

01:44.713 --> 01:46.513
I have never seen a tongue quite so...

01:46.713 --> 01:47.613
long.

01:47.713 --> 01:48.878
McGee has a long tongue?

01:48.913 --> 01:51.413
No, but the cutie-pie
he's kissing does.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.713
McGee's kissing a girl?

01:54.213 --> 01:56.113
- You can't see it, Tony.
- Why not?

01:56.313 --> 01:58.613
This is McGee's private photograph,

01:58.713 --> 02:00.913
and if he does not
want you to see it here,

02:01.013 --> 02:03.313
then you have to
respect his wishes, or...

02:04.013 --> 02:05.213
see it elsewhere.

02:05.313 --> 02:07.013
Hey! McRomeo.

02:07.213 --> 02:09.178
You should save that
stuff for the bedroom.

02:09.213 --> 02:11.778
- You're just jealous.
- Jealous? I don't think so.

02:11.813 --> 02:14.113
What you're doing there could
be illegal in some states.

02:14.148 --> 02:15.148
Or should be.

02:16.713 --> 02:18.613
I think I need to wash.

02:18.713 --> 02:21.013
- Boss, you gotta check this out.
- No, I don't.

02:22.513 --> 02:23.613
Yeah? Gibbs.

02:24.913 --> 02:26.313
Be right down.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.813
At least you don't have
to pay alimony, McGee.

02:33.313 --> 02:36.313
Meet Marine Corps Captain John Rankin.

02:36.413 --> 02:40.113
Poor fellow traveled further than
most of our guests to be here.

02:40.513 --> 02:41.413
From?

02:41.513 --> 02:42.613
Baghdad.

02:43.013 --> 02:45.513
The captain was caught
in a mortar attack.

02:45.913 --> 02:47.313
Dangerous place.

02:47.513 --> 02:50.013
You know, I was almost
killed by a mortar once.

02:50.313 --> 02:54.313
I was attending the demonstration
of a new type of 4.2 shell

02:54.513 --> 02:58.513
to senior military officials.
Lots of medals and fancy caps.

02:58.713 --> 03:00.213
Damn thing misfired.

03:00.413 --> 03:03.813
Fortunately, my services
were not required,

03:04.513 --> 03:08.113
but I digress. SecNav's office called.

03:08.413 --> 03:11.413
It seems strings were pulled
to get Captain Rankin to me

03:12.013 --> 03:15.113
rather than to one of the
Armed Forces medical examiners.

03:15.213 --> 03:16.178
Because...?

03:16.213 --> 03:20.013
Because, Jethro, even in
war, death can be deceptive.

03:20.613 --> 03:22.513
What do you see there?

03:24.313 --> 03:26.913
- Multiple shrapnel wounds.
- Yes, but in this case,

03:27.013 --> 03:30.513
all of these wounds were
made by a single projectile.

03:30.713 --> 03:33.413
The captain was likely bent over,

03:33.713 --> 03:37.213
perhaps ducking for
cover as the round landed.

03:37.613 --> 03:40.763
It pierced his left side,
nicked his small intestine,

03:40.798 --> 03:43.913
tore through his abdomen and
lodged in his right thigh.

03:44.713 --> 03:46.213
Didn't call me for that.

03:46.613 --> 03:48.313
No, not that, Jethro...

03:48.913 --> 03:49.913
For this.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.713
Captain Rankin didn't die
from the mortar attack.

03:54.513 --> 03:56.713
The poor fellow was shot.

04:10.106 --> 04:12.906
What happened, McGee, no
pictures of your girlfriend?

04:13.306 --> 04:15.206
My dog's name is Jethro, Tony.

04:15.406 --> 04:16.406
Jethro

04:16.505 --> 04:17.805
it's a boy, not a girl.

04:18.906 --> 04:22.106
Hey, whatever your preference.
Pictures of your boyfriend then.

04:29.706 --> 04:31.106
That's very funny.

04:31.806 --> 04:32.806
Fix it.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.906
You're barking up the wrong tree.

04:36.406 --> 04:39.506
Is that how you want to play this?
'Cause I can play it that way.

04:43.506 --> 04:44.471
DiNozzo!

04:44.506 --> 04:48.406
Boss, it's a new computer, top secret,
super spy software called Guard Dog.

04:48.441 --> 04:51.106
Come on, McGee, tell me you got
something better for me than that.

04:51.206 --> 04:53.406
Absolutely, I do, Boss: Baghdad.

04:53.906 --> 04:57.606
Area inside the green lines is
the International Zone, or I.Z.

04:57.706 --> 05:00.206
- Used to be called the Green Zone.
- Central Baghdad.

05:00.306 --> 05:02.106
Many of Saddam's palaces are there.

05:02.206 --> 05:04.706
I stayed in one of those palaces
after Baghdad was liberated.

05:04.806 --> 05:07.806
Me too... before Baghdad was liberated.

05:07.906 --> 05:10.206
Got a murdered Marine downstairs.

05:10.306 --> 05:12.406
Considered the safest place in Baghdad.

05:13.006 --> 05:16.306
But you all know that because
you have already been to Baghdad.

05:16.606 --> 05:19.606
This is where Captain Rankin
was killed playing basketball.

05:19.706 --> 05:21.106
It's deep inside the I.Z.

05:21.206 --> 05:24.806
Mortar rounds, fired just before
Rankin was shot, came from around here.

05:24.906 --> 05:26.026
Shot during a mortar attack.

05:26.311 --> 05:27.906
- Coincidence?
- No such thing.

05:28.010 --> 05:29.975
Someone went to a lot of
trouble to set that up.

05:30.010 --> 05:32.310
- Made it look like a terrorist attack.
- Okay, motive.

05:32.410 --> 05:34.210
Rankin was a real estate investor,

05:34.310 --> 05:37.110
worth millions by the
time he was 30 had it all,

05:37.410 --> 05:39.810
- fancy car, house on the Vineyard.
- Trophy wife?

05:39.910 --> 05:42.610
It was the wife who pulled strings
to get Ducky to do the autopsy.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.110
How's a guy like that end up in Iraq?

05:45.210 --> 05:46.860
Reserve officer. He was called up.

05:46.895 --> 05:48.510
Those guys can make enemies fast.

05:48.610 --> 05:51.610
Start throwing their weight around,
trying to get respect from enlisted men.

05:51.710 --> 05:53.010
He wasn't like that.

05:54.210 --> 05:55.210
And you are?

05:55.910 --> 05:57.110
The trophy wife.

06:01.510 --> 06:02.910
You don't have to say it.

06:04.810 --> 06:06.110
I know he was murdered.

06:06.710 --> 06:08.010
I've known all along.

06:09.210 --> 06:11.610
Get too rich too fast, you make enemies.

06:12.510 --> 06:13.910
Anyone in particular?

06:14.610 --> 06:15.610
Maybe.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.710
You got a name?

06:20.810 --> 06:22.110
Kelvin Ridgeway.

06:23.510 --> 06:25.010
How'd your husband know him?

06:25.310 --> 06:26.410
Through friends.

06:26.910 --> 06:29.010
We ended up buying a
piece of land together.

06:29.510 --> 06:30.610
Cloverfield.

06:31.310 --> 06:33.610
We put in half the down
payment, got half the equity.

06:35.510 --> 06:36.910
That's a good deal.

06:37.310 --> 06:38.910
Not if it cost John his life.

06:41.710 --> 06:45.010
Agreement was being finalized
when John got sent to Iraq.

06:45.810 --> 06:47.310
The paperwork followed him.

06:49.010 --> 06:50.510
He signed the contract, but then,

06:50.610 --> 06:53.010
the last second, decided
not to send it back.

06:53.910 --> 06:55.410
Something change his mind?

06:55.910 --> 06:57.810
My husband used to get these...

06:59.610 --> 07:00.810
gut feelings.

07:01.410 --> 07:02.810
You ever have one of those?

07:03.110 --> 07:05.010
Yeah, once or twice.

07:06.710 --> 07:08.310
The last time we spoke...

07:09.810 --> 07:11.310
he told me he had one.

07:12.110 --> 07:13.110
About?

07:15.910 --> 07:17.310
Kelvin Ridgeway.

07:18.110 --> 07:20.610
How well did you know
Captain Rankin, Major Varnai?

07:20.810 --> 07:22.710
As well as I know any
man in my unit, sir.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.110
- What kind of officer was he?
- A good one.

07:25.310 --> 07:27.010
That your opinion or somebody else?

07:27.210 --> 07:29.510
Everybody liked him, he
was popular with his men.

07:29.710 --> 07:30.810
That kind of guy.

07:31.010 --> 07:33.410
"That kind of guy" had
a bullet in his back.

07:33.710 --> 07:36.310
You know how hard it is to
get into the Zone these days?

07:36.710 --> 07:39.475
Ids, photos, fingerprints, biometrics.

07:39.510 --> 07:42.710
What you're saying is you've got a
shooter with a security clearance.

07:43.110 --> 07:45.810
You have an insurgency problem
in the Zone, Major Varnai?

07:46.510 --> 07:49.410
If that sniper picks off more
of our men, I guess we do.

07:49.710 --> 07:52.910
If not, it sounds like Captain Rankin
is the only one with the problem.

07:53.110 --> 07:55.310
A Marine was murdered on your watch.

07:56.010 --> 07:58.010
And I've lost two more since then.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.910
Blown away by roadside bombs.

08:00.410 --> 08:02.610
That's part of our
reality out here, sir.

08:02.810 --> 08:04.010
Doesn't mean I like it.

08:05.210 --> 08:06.910
Thank you for your time, Major.

08:08.210 --> 08:10.310
You want me to brief
the in-country RAC?

08:11.310 --> 08:12.310
No.

08:12.510 --> 08:14.710
Marine gets murdered
serving his country,

08:14.810 --> 08:17.610
- he deserves a thorough investigation.
- And he'll get one,

08:17.910 --> 08:20.210
but the Secnav wants
us handling this case.

08:21.610 --> 08:23.210
Who do you think I should send?

08:24.110 --> 08:26.310
I think they're going to
send one of us to Iraq.

08:26.810 --> 08:30.410
Why would you want to go to Baghdad?
You're gonna get bombed and shot at.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.510
Everyone has gone except for me.

08:32.809 --> 08:33.909
I've never been.

08:34.309 --> 08:37.010
By everyone, I mean
Tony and Ziva and Gibbs.

08:37.210 --> 08:40.809
Gibbs must have gone to Iraq dozens
of times I just want to go once.

08:41.010 --> 08:43.210
- To earn your stripes?
- Yeah, to prove myself.

08:43.309 --> 08:44.310
To die?

08:44.610 --> 08:46.510
I'm not gonna die in Baghdad.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.810
Thing is, though, before I
go, they have to choose me.

08:48.845 --> 08:51.010
So why don't you just
go talk to the director?

08:51.110 --> 08:52.710
Or, our acting director.

08:52.910 --> 08:54.910
- Assistant director.
- Right Leon.

08:55.010 --> 08:56.010
I can't.

08:56.310 --> 08:59.110
Tony says if I really want to
go then I shouldn't volunteer.

08:59.310 --> 09:02.810
But if he says I shouldn't volunteer,
then he thinks I will volunteer,

09:02.845 --> 09:06.810
which means that if I really
want to go, I shouldn't volunteer.

09:08.910 --> 09:11.510
That's... good, Timmy.

09:12.110 --> 09:13.375
It sounds like you're...

09:13.410 --> 09:16.210
not doing exactly what you shouldn't.

09:24.310 --> 09:26.010
- Nikki.
- Ziva.

09:26.410 --> 09:28.510
- What do you have there?
- It's nothing.

09:29.810 --> 09:32.210
"Five reasons why I should
be picked to go to Iraq."

09:35.910 --> 09:37.710
You've heard the rumors, too.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.010
You do not know that Iraq is a war zone?

09:41.210 --> 09:42.210
Nikki,

09:42.510 --> 09:43.610
it is dirty there.

09:43.810 --> 09:46.410
Sanitation is very poor. And diseases.

09:46.610 --> 09:48.410
Have you ever heard of leishmaniasis?

09:48.910 --> 09:52.410
It begins with a large oozing
sore, often in the face.

09:52.610 --> 09:54.110
And then it just...

09:55.910 --> 09:58.010
- I have photos I can show you.
- No!

09:58.610 --> 10:01.510
Thank you for your
concern, but I still...

10:01.710 --> 10:02.910
really want to go.

10:08.710 --> 10:09.810
In that case,

10:10.310 --> 10:12.210
I hope you can handle competition

10:13.010 --> 10:15.510
a lot better... than you can handle...

10:17.410 --> 10:18.510
handles.

10:26.410 --> 10:28.310
What can I tell you that
you don't already know?

10:28.345 --> 10:30.175
I had the inside scoop,
Rankin had the money.

10:30.210 --> 10:32.410
We were all gonna be rich.
Rankin was already rich.

10:32.445 --> 10:33.510
Can never be too rich.

10:33.710 --> 10:36.310
Or thin. It's a cliché,
but I'm right. Am I right?

10:36.610 --> 10:39.010
- Thank you, sweetie pants.
- You're welcome, Mr. Ridgeway.

10:39.045 --> 10:40.910
I heard he wasn't very happy at the end.

10:41.010 --> 10:44.010
He's just one of those glass half-empty
kind of guys, you know what I mean?

10:44.045 --> 10:45.810
He questioned every
little stupid detail.

10:45.910 --> 10:47.010
You sound pissed.

10:47.110 --> 10:48.810
Men have been murdered for less.

10:49.310 --> 10:52.110
Yes, men have, but I'm
not an ordinary man.

10:52.410 --> 10:54.910
At least that's what I've been
told, you know what I'm sayin'?

10:55.110 --> 10:57.075
His wife said that he
didn't like you very much.

10:57.110 --> 10:59.710
So what, who cares? I care
much more what she thinks of me

10:59.810 --> 11:02.186
- than my business partner.
- I hope you don't care too much.

11:02.210 --> 11:04.910
I mean, you know how we talk to
women, right, Agent... What is it?

11:05.710 --> 11:08.010
Right, I mean, we just
didn't see eye to eye.

11:08.110 --> 11:10.150
You know, he'd always
complain to his wife about me,

11:10.310 --> 11:12.310
and I complain to my
girlfriend about him.

11:12.610 --> 11:15.110
Like I would assume you complain
to your wife about this one.

11:15.510 --> 11:16.510
Her?

11:20.110 --> 11:21.910
No, I wouldn't mess with her.

11:22.710 --> 11:24.610
Yeah? Why would he say that?

11:30.910 --> 11:31.910
McGee.

11:32.810 --> 11:34.610
You're looking very guilty over there.

11:34.710 --> 11:37.010
You didn't do that thing I
told you not to do, did you?

11:37.410 --> 11:38.610
Why would I do that?

11:39.410 --> 11:40.410
Did you do that?

11:40.610 --> 11:41.610
Gibbs back yet?

11:41.710 --> 11:43.510
Well, just arrived, sir.

11:49.310 --> 11:52.110
Assistant Director, I was
wondering if I could talk to you.

11:52.310 --> 11:53.510
- About?
- Iraq.

11:53.610 --> 11:56.810
If anyone is going to go to Iraq,
I really believe it should be me.

11:56.845 --> 11:59.710
It is my area of expertise. I
have a lot of contacts there.

11:59.745 --> 12:02.110
- As do I.
- My contacts are still breathing.

12:02.145 --> 12:03.310
As are...

12:03.710 --> 12:04.810
most of mine.

12:04.910 --> 12:05.710
Plus,

12:05.910 --> 12:08.610
- I speak Arabic fluently.
- I speak Arabic and Kurdish.

12:08.710 --> 12:11.310
- I am not afraid to get my hands dirty.
- I told you.

12:12.210 --> 12:14.475
I'm glad you both are
so eager to take on

12:14.510 --> 12:16.810
what will no doubt be a
very difficult mission.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.710
I want a thorough investigation
and a quick resolution.

12:20.910 --> 12:21.910
McGee?

12:22.110 --> 12:23.075
Yes, sir.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.310
Disappointed you're the only
one who didn't volunteer.

12:25.410 --> 12:28.510
Missions like this give an agent
an opportunity to prove themselves.

12:28.710 --> 12:31.610
But, Tony, he didn't volunteer either.

12:31.910 --> 12:33.110
He spoke to me earlier.

12:33.410 --> 12:35.410
DiNozzo, pack your bags.

12:35.610 --> 12:37.110
Thank you, sir.

12:37.910 --> 12:38.910
David.

12:39.110 --> 12:40.910
Sending an Israeli to Baghdad...

12:41.610 --> 12:42.710
I don't think so.

12:42.810 --> 12:46.210
DiNozzo, make sure Agent
Jardine gets back in one piece.

12:46.510 --> 12:47.510
You got it, sir.

12:50.310 --> 12:53.210
The plane to Baghdad takes off in
less than two hours. Get moving.

13:06.762 --> 13:08.262
World clocks.

13:08.762 --> 13:10.762
Wouldn't be checking the
time in Iraq, would you?

13:11.262 --> 13:12.862
Don't know what you're talking about.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.762
Iraq's not so great.

13:18.062 --> 13:19.362
I mean, the whole...

13:19.462 --> 13:22.862
trip is probably a big waste of
time. The murder's probably here.

13:23.262 --> 13:25.362
Awfully long gun barrel if that is true.

13:25.462 --> 13:28.362
Captain Rankin's wife thinks it has
something to do with that land deal.

13:28.397 --> 13:29.327
So she says.

13:29.362 --> 13:31.362
Think she did it? She is
the one that called us.

13:31.562 --> 13:33.062
Well, it would not be the first time

13:33.162 --> 13:34.962
a murder tried to throw us up that way.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.362
Off, throw us off.

13:36.762 --> 13:37.812
Exactly.

13:37.847 --> 13:38.827
However,

13:38.862 --> 13:42.262
Kelvin Ridgeway is guilty of more
than just being a pig. Of that,

13:42.362 --> 13:43.462
I am sure.

13:44.462 --> 13:47.662
You know what? I checked Captain
Rankin's phone records from Iraq.

13:47.862 --> 13:50.562
In the two days before he was
killed, he called three people:

13:50.597 --> 13:51.862
His wife Dina,

13:51.962 --> 13:53.762
his partner Kelvin Ridgeway,

13:54.262 --> 13:55.262
and this guy...

13:55.562 --> 13:58.762
George Stenner. He owns a small
company called Land Test Labs.

13:58.862 --> 14:00.162
They do soil testing.

14:00.262 --> 14:03.362
Rankin called Stenner three
times the day he was killed.

14:03.462 --> 14:05.662
Gibbs is definitely going
to want to talk to him.

14:07.662 --> 14:09.262
By the way, it's been 45 minutes.

14:10.362 --> 14:11.362
Excuse me?

14:11.562 --> 14:14.262
Since Nikki and Tony arrived in Baghdad.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.962
Which would place them at...

14:16.162 --> 14:17.162
Their hotel.

14:32.262 --> 14:33.362
This is it.

14:34.962 --> 14:36.627
Well, welcome to the Baghdad Hilton.

14:36.662 --> 14:38.962
Overflow accommodations.
Best we can offer.

14:39.362 --> 14:40.662
Unpack. Get comfortable.

14:41.062 --> 14:42.362
Wouldn't get too comfortable.

14:46.562 --> 14:47.862
Ah, yeah.

14:48.462 --> 14:49.562
It's just like home.

14:50.762 --> 14:52.262
If you live in an airport.

15:00.462 --> 15:01.762
You got a problem, Jardine?

15:01.962 --> 15:04.862
I just thought I'd have
a little more privacy.

15:18.562 --> 15:20.062
Where do you think you're going?

15:20.262 --> 15:22.362
Just got off a transatlantic flight.

15:22.397 --> 15:23.397
Need a shower.

15:23.462 --> 15:26.462
Yeah, well, crime scenes don't
wait. Showers do. Besides...

15:27.262 --> 15:29.262
not even I would shower in that.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.062
It's going to be a long week.

15:41.062 --> 15:42.162
Squared away?

15:42.197 --> 15:43.062
Yeah.

15:43.162 --> 15:44.262
Ready to roll.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.662
You're not gonna need all that
stuff, Jardine, this is the I.Z.

15:49.762 --> 15:52.362
35 mortars were fired
into the International Zone

15:52.397 --> 15:53.962
on a single day last July.

15:54.362 --> 15:55.862
Dozens more in the year since.

15:56.262 --> 15:57.562
You do what you want.

15:58.862 --> 16:00.162
I'll wear the helmet.

16:00.762 --> 16:02.262
Why the hell are you here?

16:02.362 --> 16:03.362
Really.

16:03.562 --> 16:05.962
Because it's going to look
really good on my resume.

16:07.462 --> 16:08.862
That's not why she's here.

16:22.962 --> 16:24.027
Lock it up.

16:24.062 --> 16:25.162
Roger that, major.

16:26.062 --> 16:27.362
The court where it happened.

16:28.062 --> 16:31.162
Sergeant Jim Gilroy. Other guy's
a contract worker, Allan Hayes.

16:31.197 --> 16:33.462
They were both with Captain
Rankin when he got hit.

16:34.562 --> 16:35.762
Knock yourselves out.

16:38.862 --> 16:39.862
Charming.

16:40.462 --> 16:41.962
Knows how to make you feel welcome.

16:41.997 --> 16:43.427
Well, it's stressful out here.

16:43.462 --> 16:45.162
May be a coping mechanism, you know?

16:45.462 --> 16:47.462
Shutting off his emotions
to get the job done.

16:47.762 --> 16:49.462
Good morning, Baghdad.

16:50.162 --> 16:51.762
Agent DiNozzo, NCIS.

16:51.962 --> 16:55.062
You two were playing basketball with
Captain Rankin when he was killed.

16:55.097 --> 16:57.162
Major says he was shot, sir. That true?

16:57.662 --> 16:59.027
That depends.

16:59.062 --> 17:00.362
Did you hear a shot?

17:00.462 --> 17:02.062
All I heard were the mortars, sir.

17:02.562 --> 17:03.712
Good officer?

17:03.747 --> 17:04.827
Yes, sir.

17:04.862 --> 17:06.162
Proud to serve with him.

17:06.262 --> 17:08.662
You two notice anything out
of the ordinary that day?

17:08.696 --> 17:09.727
No, sir.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.262
We were just playing ball,

17:11.462 --> 17:13.262
heard the incoming, and hit the ground.

17:14.162 --> 17:15.362
I was right next to him.

17:16.662 --> 17:18.662
Anyone have a grudge
against Captain Rankin?

17:18.762 --> 17:19.727
No, sir.

17:19.762 --> 17:21.061
Very well liked.

17:21.262 --> 17:22.561
Good Marine officer.

17:25.061 --> 17:26.462
Yeah, you keep saying that.

17:27.662 --> 17:28.762
How about you?

17:29.262 --> 17:30.662
I didn't know him so well.

17:30.762 --> 17:33.373
Not enlisted. We've been playing a
pickup game here for a couple weeks.

17:33.397 --> 17:35.197
Guy seemed cool. He was
a pretty good shooter.

17:35.962 --> 17:37.762
Where was he when he was killed?

17:37.962 --> 17:38.962
Free throw line.

17:40.362 --> 17:41.662
Which way was he facing?

17:41.762 --> 17:42.762
The hoop.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.062
That would make sense.

17:44.662 --> 17:45.662
All right.

17:49.862 --> 17:51.962
Hit in the lower back on the left side.

17:52.662 --> 17:53.962
Right out in the open.

17:55.762 --> 17:58.262
Bullet was fired from a height.
Could be any one of those.

17:58.297 --> 18:00.762
- What's that over there, Major?
- Believe that's a hotel.

18:00.862 --> 18:02.062
And next to it?

18:02.362 --> 18:03.662
Family residence, maybe.

18:03.862 --> 18:06.462
- All right, thank you guys very much.
- Sir, no problem.

18:06.862 --> 18:08.462
So tell me about the mortar attack?

18:08.562 --> 18:10.662
Found the launcher. Plastic tubes,

18:10.762 --> 18:12.027
welded frame.

18:12.062 --> 18:13.727
16 millimeters. Small stuff.

18:13.762 --> 18:15.862
- Not as deadly as some.
- And the guy behind it?

18:16.062 --> 18:17.462
Local Haji. Insurgent.

18:18.762 --> 18:19.827
You caught him?

18:19.862 --> 18:21.962
Not quick enough. Tribal
militia got to him first.

18:22.362 --> 18:23.527
Are they on our side?

18:23.562 --> 18:25.062
Controlled by a local sheikh.

18:25.162 --> 18:27.862
Think neighborhood watch with AK-47s.

18:28.762 --> 18:29.962
I need to talk to him.

18:30.862 --> 18:32.262
Know any good mediums?

18:33.962 --> 18:34.962
Convenient.

18:35.362 --> 18:38.062
The one guy who can tell us who
killed Rankin is six feet under.

18:39.162 --> 18:40.362
Four feet around here.

18:51.062 --> 18:52.962
No need Mr. Stenner, sit down.

18:53.162 --> 18:55.662
I don't understand. I mean,
can you tell me why I'm...?

18:55.697 --> 18:56.962
- Are you nervous?
- No.

18:57.962 --> 18:59.362
Yeah. I mean, yeah, a little.

18:59.962 --> 19:01.762
- Can I go to the bathroom?
- In a minute.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.062
So...

19:13.762 --> 19:16.262
why did John Rankin
call you last Monday,

19:16.362 --> 19:17.862
day before he was killed?

19:18.762 --> 19:19.762
He's dead?

19:21.062 --> 19:23.112
I know that already,
I just can't believe...

19:23.147 --> 19:25.162
- Answer?
- He had this piece of land...

19:25.562 --> 19:27.562
- Cloverfield.
- Yeah. That, that... Yeah.

19:27.662 --> 19:30.862
So, a few weeks ago he called
me to do some soil testing on it,

19:31.262 --> 19:33.262
and he didn't want
anyone to know about it.

19:33.362 --> 19:34.462
What'd you find?

19:34.562 --> 19:36.262
That the land was contaminated.

19:37.062 --> 19:39.162
Heavy metals, mostly, lead,

19:39.462 --> 19:41.162
other things that are harmful to people.

19:41.462 --> 19:42.762
Children especially.

19:42.962 --> 19:43.962
What'd Rankin say?

19:44.762 --> 19:46.662
He said that he was gonna
tear up the contract.

19:46.762 --> 19:49.462
You know, he seemed really, really
angry with his business partner.

19:50.262 --> 19:51.362
Who else saw the report?

19:51.562 --> 19:53.227
No one. It was secret.

19:53.262 --> 19:56.462
I only made one copy, and
I sent it to him in Iraq.

19:56.562 --> 19:57.662
I need a copy.

19:58.062 --> 20:00.262
No problem. I'll e-mail it right over.

20:03.762 --> 20:05.862
Now, can I just please go
to the bathroom really...?

20:06.262 --> 20:07.262
Okay.

20:07.462 --> 20:08.662
I'm kidding. You can go.

20:09.162 --> 20:10.162
Thanks.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.162
Bang! The shot came from here.

20:35.262 --> 20:37.462
Jardine, up here.

20:45.262 --> 20:46.462
Shell casing.

20:55.162 --> 20:57.627
Yeah. 7.62, it's not one of ours.

20:57.662 --> 20:59.662
I need to know who had
access to this room.

20:59.762 --> 21:00.962
I don't have a terp here.

21:01.362 --> 21:04.262
Terp? Is that Varnai
speak for "interpreter"?

21:04.297 --> 21:06.362
In which case, Jardine,

21:06.462 --> 21:09.062
would you ask our friend here
who had access to this room?

21:21.062 --> 21:22.962
She says the man who lived here died,

21:23.062 --> 21:25.762
his brother Ali Mahmoud is the
only other person with a key.

21:26.262 --> 21:27.562
Can she get him for us?

21:32.562 --> 21:35.162
She says Ali hasn't show up
here since the mortar attack.

21:35.662 --> 21:36.762
Big surprise.

21:38.062 --> 21:39.962
But she does know where he lives.

21:40.662 --> 21:42.527
It's all here, Boss,
just like Stenner said.

21:42.562 --> 21:45.462
Heavy contaminations of lead,
cadmium and zinc in the soil.

21:45.497 --> 21:47.927
Reason enough for Rankin
to want out of the deal?

21:47.962 --> 21:50.573
Think Ridgeway knew and was trying
to get Rankin to sign the deal before

21:50.597 --> 21:51.662
he found out?

21:52.962 --> 21:55.762
I'll, check on Ridgeway's phone
records, see who he's been calling.

22:05.962 --> 22:07.362
First squad, forward security.

22:07.397 --> 22:08.929
Second squad, rear security.

22:08.964 --> 22:10.462
You stay close, do as I say.

22:10.762 --> 22:11.862
Don't worry, I will.

22:16.062 --> 22:17.262
Open door left!

22:17.297 --> 22:18.462
Open door right!

22:25.762 --> 22:27.212
What is she saying? Where is he?

22:27.247 --> 22:28.662
She keeps saying we're too late.

22:29.362 --> 22:30.462
Too late for what?

22:34.462 --> 22:36.727
Several hooded men beat Ali,

22:36.762 --> 22:38.762
they took him away in
handcuffs last night.

22:39.162 --> 22:40.362
Who was it the police?

22:42.462 --> 22:43.862
No, she doesn't think so.

22:52.062 --> 22:53.962
Let me guess more good news?

22:54.262 --> 22:56.062
She thinks they're going to execute him.

22:57.562 --> 22:58.562
Great.

23:06.751 --> 23:08.016
- That's it.
- Yes, yes.

23:08.051 --> 23:10.251
- Come on, that's it.
- Yes.

23:11.951 --> 23:13.051
That's it.

23:13.151 --> 23:14.851
Amazing.

23:15.051 --> 23:16.551
That's amazing.

23:16.651 --> 23:17.451
Nice.

23:17.651 --> 23:20.651
Off goes my little
e-mail chickadee to Abby.

23:21.151 --> 23:23.151
- Three bars.
- That's pretty good.

23:23.251 --> 23:24.651
Eh, five?

23:30.451 --> 23:32.951
I only almost touched you.

23:33.251 --> 23:34.251
There was no...

23:35.451 --> 23:39.451
You know, for someone who hates germs
so much, you're really quite a slob.

23:39.651 --> 23:41.451
One has nothing to do with the other.

23:41.486 --> 23:42.551
Right.

23:43.051 --> 23:46.451
Since we're on the subject of things
that make absolutely no sense at all,

23:46.751 --> 23:48.451
you want to tell me the truth?

23:49.351 --> 23:51.651
Maybe we could, find out...

23:52.151 --> 23:53.251
why you're here.

23:53.751 --> 23:54.751
I told you.

23:55.251 --> 23:57.316
The Middle East is my area of expertise.

23:57.351 --> 23:59.351
I'm here because it's
professionally advantageous.

23:59.551 --> 24:02.651
Is that why you were making a phone
call in Arabic on the basketball court?

24:02.686 --> 24:04.651
Because it was
professionally advantageous?

24:07.151 --> 24:09.751
Never thought it was possible
to hurt yourself with a wet wipe.

24:12.051 --> 24:13.651
I have a brother.

24:14.951 --> 24:15.951
He's a Marine.

24:17.951 --> 24:20.651
He was here in Baghdad two years ago.

24:22.451 --> 24:23.651
He was wounded.

24:26.351 --> 24:27.951
I just wanted to see where it happened.

24:28.651 --> 24:30.851
We're very close, and

24:30.951 --> 24:33.351
I just need to experience what he...

24:35.851 --> 24:37.551
All right, here we go.

24:37.951 --> 24:39.451
Tony, is that really you?

24:39.651 --> 24:41.351
Move back so we can see your face.

24:41.951 --> 24:43.551
- Hi.
- Hi, good-looking.

24:43.651 --> 24:44.951
I missed you.

24:45.451 --> 24:47.751
Is Neat Nut Nikki driving you crazy?

24:48.151 --> 24:50.551
Actually, she's right here, and she's...

24:50.851 --> 24:52.151
not as neat as you think.

24:52.351 --> 24:53.751
Sorry, Nikki.

24:53.951 --> 24:56.351
I don't really think that you're a nut,

24:56.386 --> 24:57.851
just, you know, that you're neat.

24:57.951 --> 25:00.251
Not neat like cool, but
neat like, you know, neat.

25:00.286 --> 25:02.851
Not that you're not cool. You're just...

25:02.886 --> 25:03.886
It's okay.

25:04.451 --> 25:06.251
I didn't know you guys
were sharing a room.

25:06.286 --> 25:07.451
They're sharing a room?

25:07.551 --> 25:09.016
We're not exactly sharing a room.

25:09.051 --> 25:11.751
Either they're sharing a room
or they're not sharing a room.

25:11.786 --> 25:14.368
I don't see what is so
exact or not exact about it.

25:14.403 --> 25:16.951
Abs, did you get my scan
of the bullet casing?

25:17.051 --> 25:18.051
Done and done.

25:18.751 --> 25:21.227
I just ran it through the Central
Command database. You know that

25:21.251 --> 25:24.651
they fingerprint pretty much everybody
that works or lives at the I.Z.

25:24.686 --> 25:28.051
Let me guess... it's a fingerprint
that belongs to Ali Mahmoud.

25:28.086 --> 25:29.086
That's him!

25:29.151 --> 25:31.116
He's an Iraqi national and

25:31.151 --> 25:33.751
he is working in the
I.Z. as a maintenance guy.

25:33.786 --> 25:36.351
He's 25 years old. Part
of the Al Shammar tribe.

25:36.451 --> 25:38.451
That's one of the most
prominent tribes in Iraq.

25:38.486 --> 25:39.616
No criminal convictions,

25:39.651 --> 25:42.751
but his brother was killed in
crossfire about a month ago.

25:42.786 --> 25:44.251
Rankin's squad was involved...

25:44.551 --> 25:46.651
Ali may have snapped and killed Rankin.

25:46.851 --> 25:48.151
So...

25:48.451 --> 25:50.151
you got any leads on Ali's whereabouts?

25:50.251 --> 25:52.216
Tony, you're in the same city as him.

25:52.251 --> 25:55.051
We're ten time zones away. Why
were you sent to Iraq again?

25:55.251 --> 25:56.251
Good question.

25:58.351 --> 25:59.451
Well, let us know.

26:00.351 --> 26:02.751
And put my Kill Bill mug
back on my desk, McGee.

26:05.151 --> 26:07.116
Major, a man in your unit was murdered.

26:07.151 --> 26:09.351
Is there a reason you don't
want to find out who did it?

26:09.386 --> 26:10.451
Sure I do.

26:10.851 --> 26:12.951
I'd like the war to end,
the electricity to work

26:12.986 --> 26:14.651
and for all the tribes to get along.

26:14.751 --> 26:17.751
One of my contacts his family
is part of the Al Shammar tribe.

26:17.851 --> 26:19.016
Same tribe as Ali.

26:19.051 --> 26:20.551
It's a long shot, but...

26:20.651 --> 26:24.351
The Iraqi are so close, one of them
stubs a toe in the shower, by the time

26:24.386 --> 26:28.051
he's dry five of his cousins are at
his front door to ask if he's okay.

26:30.451 --> 26:31.651
She's messy.

26:32.151 --> 26:33.551
Obsessively.

26:33.851 --> 26:34.851
Found him.

26:34.951 --> 26:37.051
My contact knows one of
the men who abducted him.

26:37.086 --> 26:38.751
He said it's the talk
of the neighborhood.

26:38.786 --> 26:39.851
Need an address.

26:45.951 --> 26:47.416
He said he can take us there.

26:47.451 --> 26:50.351
Hold up. No one's driving into the
party zone at this time of night.

26:50.451 --> 26:53.351
- Trail's gonna go cold.
- The trail, Agent DiNozzo.

26:53.386 --> 26:56.016
Is filled with roadside
bombs and snipers

26:56.051 --> 26:58.551
who just love to pick
off vacationing warriors

26:58.586 --> 27:00.751
like yourself in the dark of the night.

27:01.051 --> 27:03.251
And while I wouldn't mind
sacrificing you to them,

27:03.651 --> 27:05.751
I have a family I'd like to return to...

27:06.451 --> 27:07.451
eventually.

27:07.851 --> 27:09.151
Pick you up at first light.

27:14.151 --> 27:15.251
Anything yet?

27:15.551 --> 27:17.901
Yeah, I got Kelvin
Ridgeway's phone records.

27:17.936 --> 27:20.251
Like anyone would
wanna talk to that man.

27:21.051 --> 27:22.551
Apparently Captain Rankin did.

27:22.651 --> 27:25.016
He called Ridgeway twice
the day before he died.

27:25.051 --> 27:27.351
If Rankin told him he was
pulling out, of the deal...

27:27.386 --> 27:29.351
Gives Ridgeway time to organize the hit.

27:29.751 --> 27:33.151
Now if Tony and Nikki could just
find our trigger man in Iraq...

27:33.186 --> 27:35.651
All we will have to do
is confirm who hired him.

27:35.686 --> 27:36.951
Get me Ridgeway.

27:45.851 --> 27:48.251
Marines call this "Fool's Crossing".

27:48.951 --> 27:51.651
Insurgents like to stop our
troops with an IDF or an IED,

27:51.686 --> 27:53.551
finish the job off with SAF.

27:53.751 --> 27:57.251
They set off a roadside bomb, when you
stop your convoy, they shoot at you.

27:57.351 --> 27:58.351
Finish the job.

27:59.251 --> 28:01.701
- What the hell...
- Where are you going?

28:01.736 --> 28:04.151
Dismount and secure
the area. Go, go, go!

28:05.051 --> 28:06.151
Agent Jardine!

28:08.951 --> 28:10.251
Jardine, get down!

28:10.951 --> 28:11.951
He's hit!

28:16.551 --> 28:18.051
What are you doing?

28:23.451 --> 28:24.451
Wait.

28:26.651 --> 28:27.651
Jameel.

28:34.851 --> 28:36.951
It is good to meet you finally.

28:37.651 --> 28:38.651
Come,

28:39.151 --> 28:40.351
meet my friends.

28:43.951 --> 28:47.851
Major Varnai, this is my
contact, Jameel Al-Farhad.

28:48.351 --> 28:50.551
- Peace to you.
- And to you.

28:51.051 --> 28:52.051
A word.

28:52.951 --> 28:55.451
You do not break protocol.
You put everyone in danger.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.851
What's going on here?
What is really going on?

28:57.886 --> 28:59.751
- I told you...
- No, the truth.

29:01.351 --> 29:04.951
This is where it happened, okay?
This is where my brother was shot.

29:05.751 --> 29:08.551
- And your contact here?
- He and his family saw it happen.

29:10.351 --> 29:11.351
And that's it?

29:11.386 --> 29:12.386
No.

29:14.251 --> 29:17.151
We're here because he's
going to help us find Ali.

29:19.251 --> 29:21.251
Jameel, your English is very good.

29:22.751 --> 29:24.151
I learn in school.

29:24.251 --> 29:26.351
I also teach my sister.

29:31.751 --> 29:35.451
- They don't teach English to the girls?
- She doesn't go to school anymore.

29:35.486 --> 29:37.451
Not since my father dies.

29:38.351 --> 29:40.651
I help her a little bit, I can.

29:42.251 --> 29:44.151
Let's go. We're Oscar Mike.

29:45.251 --> 29:46.251
Come on.

29:50.051 --> 29:52.251
Does anybody want to tell
me what I'm doing here?

29:54.551 --> 29:55.551
Sure.

29:57.251 --> 30:00.951
We know about the soil tests Captain
Rankin had done on Cloverfield.

30:01.251 --> 30:02.451
Heavy metals.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.551
Cadmium, lead, trace elements of zinc...

30:05.586 --> 30:06.951
What are you talking about?

30:08.451 --> 30:10.916
You knew Cloverfield was
contaminated, Mr. Ridgeway.

30:10.951 --> 30:14.351
You knew that Rankin wouldn't be
part of your deal if he found out.

30:14.551 --> 30:17.451
Must've really irked you to hear
that he had done his own soil tests.

30:17.751 --> 30:19.751
So what? What do you think that I did?

30:20.051 --> 30:23.151
- Had Captain Rankin killed.
- Yes, nice speculation.

30:23.551 --> 30:24.651
Got a motive.

30:25.051 --> 30:26.816
He was about to mess up your deal.

30:26.851 --> 30:29.116
When you find the guy
who pulled the trigger,

30:29.151 --> 30:32.351
he's going to tell you the same
thing. I had nothing to do with it.

30:32.951 --> 30:35.451
Got agents on their way there right now

30:35.486 --> 30:37.951
to talk to the shooter as we speak.

30:40.151 --> 30:41.551
You don't mind waiting, uh?

31:00.651 --> 31:02.951
Come to Baghdad 'cause
you wanna see a show.

31:03.251 --> 31:04.951
You're about to get one.

31:08.451 --> 31:10.651
I'm guessing he's not
complimenting my vest.

31:10.751 --> 31:13.651
He seems to know your
mother very intimately.

31:17.151 --> 31:18.151
Ali?

31:27.451 --> 31:29.051
He says we can go in.

31:41.351 --> 31:43.151
Wakey, wakey, sunshine.

31:50.651 --> 31:52.351
We got a problem, boss.

31:53.351 --> 31:56.951
Our suspect's not about to
talk... His tongue's been cut out.

32:22.727 --> 32:25.927
The guard said he hasn't
checked on Ali since last night.

32:26.427 --> 32:28.492
- You believe him?
- Jameel does.

32:28.527 --> 32:32.127
- You don't know him very well, do you?
- I know he's a good kid.

32:32.527 --> 32:36.227
- You think he's a good kid.
- I think the guard has told the truth.

32:36.262 --> 32:37.692
He says he brought Ali dinner,

32:37.727 --> 32:40.727
then later heard him yelling and
crying but didn't come in to check.

32:41.427 --> 32:44.027
I'd be yelling and crying too
if my tongue was being cut out.

32:44.127 --> 32:47.727
- These tribal guys don't mess around.
- Tribal? I don't think so.

32:49.327 --> 32:52.527
Tongue cut out. They didn't
want him to talk. It's a sign.

32:52.727 --> 32:54.592
But not one that this tribe uses.

32:54.627 --> 32:56.392
The tongue thing tells
me that the person

32:56.427 --> 32:59.127
who killed Ali doesn't know
much about tribal culture...

32:59.162 --> 33:01.027
Didn't think we would either.

33:02.227 --> 33:04.227
You mean someone like the major?

33:04.727 --> 33:06.792
He knew where Ali was being held.

33:06.827 --> 33:09.192
Heard you say it on
the phone last night.

33:09.227 --> 33:12.627
- You really think he might have...
- If we could establish time of death,

33:12.727 --> 33:14.327
it might help us find out.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.792
Right, Tony. You take two temperatures:

33:17.827 --> 33:20.177
The room where the body
lies and the body itself.

33:20.212 --> 33:22.527
Comparing the two will
give you the time you want.

33:22.827 --> 33:26.327
First should be easy, the second
only slightly more complicated.

33:26.727 --> 33:30.427
- What are my choices?
- You're going to need a thermometer.

33:32.227 --> 33:33.527
- Got one.
- Good.

33:33.627 --> 33:36.227
And you'll need a sharp
knife of some sort.

33:37.427 --> 33:38.727
Got one of those, too.

33:38.927 --> 33:41.027
What do I need a sharp knife for?

33:41.427 --> 33:43.727
So you can cut into the body, dear boy.

33:44.327 --> 33:46.327
- Ready to go?
- Excuse me.

33:46.727 --> 33:48.792
Major Varnai, this is a crime scene.

33:48.827 --> 33:52.327
This is Baghdad, Agent DiNozzo.
The whole place is a crime scene.

33:55.627 --> 33:56.827
A Few Good Men.

33:57.227 --> 33:59.492
- What?
- Jack Nicholson.

33:59.527 --> 34:02.527
I knew he reminded me of somebody.
I'm going to have to call you back.

34:02.562 --> 34:05.327
- There's someone I need to talk to.
- Ducky, wait.

34:05.627 --> 34:07.527
Tony, I can do it.

34:09.827 --> 34:10.827
Germs.

34:11.726 --> 34:13.726
- Gloves.
- Good luck with that.

34:18.027 --> 34:19.226
Are you there?

34:19.627 --> 34:21.027
I'm ready, Ducky.

34:23.127 --> 34:25.127
You never liked Captain
Rankin, did you, Major?

34:25.527 --> 34:26.726
You prefer tough guys.

34:27.027 --> 34:29.192
He was a reserve officer, too soft.

34:29.226 --> 34:31.927
They don't know what they're
doing out here, guys like that.

34:31.962 --> 34:33.792
Put the rest of you in danger, huh?

34:33.827 --> 34:37.327
- Like you've been doing, Agent DiNozzo?
- You didn't want us to come here today.

34:37.362 --> 34:39.092
You tried to keep us from finding Ali,

34:39.127 --> 34:42.177
and you certainly didn't seem
surprised to find him dead.

34:42.212 --> 34:45.226
- Told you it's a violent culture.
- Yeah, maybe it is.

34:45.427 --> 34:49.027
Or maybe, last night, when you
heard where he was being held,

34:49.127 --> 34:50.427
you came out here.

34:51.927 --> 34:54.927
You acted like you don't
understand Arabic, but you do.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.727
You had the time, Major, and the access.

35:02.627 --> 35:05.227
Semper fi, Agent DiNozzo.

35:06.127 --> 35:08.327
Words to live and die by out here.

35:09.927 --> 35:11.827
I wouldn't kill a fellow Marine.

35:12.127 --> 35:14.227
Even if you didn't think
he was a "real" Marine?

35:14.262 --> 35:15.827
Your feelings, not mine.

35:16.227 --> 35:18.127
Some of my best men are reservists.

35:19.727 --> 35:22.027
Is this something I need to hear now?

35:22.527 --> 35:24.227
The body, Ali,

35:24.627 --> 35:26.527
was killed four hours ago.

35:26.927 --> 35:27.927
Yeah?

35:30.127 --> 35:33.327
Major Varnai has been
with us all morning.

35:38.127 --> 35:40.727
This four hour thing, you're
sure about that? Really sure?

35:42.127 --> 35:43.827
Sorry about that, just doing my job.

35:47.927 --> 35:49.527
I hate it when that happens.

35:50.527 --> 35:51.927
Awkward moments.

35:52.827 --> 35:55.527
- You, you all right?
- It's just...

35:56.027 --> 35:58.927
- so oppressive in there.
- The smell of death.

35:59.127 --> 36:01.327
It's that awful chemical smell.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.327
- Chemicals?
- Turpentine.

36:05.127 --> 36:06.527
I'm hypersensitive.

36:06.627 --> 36:09.227
I usually only have this
problem in new buildings.

36:09.262 --> 36:11.427
Construction workers
use it all the time.

36:11.462 --> 36:12.527
Construction?

36:12.827 --> 36:14.827
Have you reacted since we've been here?

36:14.862 --> 36:16.944
Happened yesterday on
the basketball court

36:16.979 --> 36:19.027
when you were talking
to those witnesses.

36:21.627 --> 36:23.527
Wasn't one of them a
construction worker?

36:31.527 --> 36:33.627
- I need to talk to the big man.
- Hold on.

36:33.727 --> 36:35.427
Let me put you on speaker.

36:36.427 --> 36:38.927
I need a background
check: U.S. citizen...

36:39.027 --> 36:39.992
Alan Hayes.

36:40.027 --> 36:42.827
- He works here in Baghdad.
- What do you got on him?

36:42.862 --> 36:43.792
Bad smell, boss.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.827
Nikki picked up his
scent at the crime scene.

36:46.027 --> 36:48.527
Alan Michael Hayes, 27 years old,

36:48.627 --> 36:51.727
has a police record: Petty
thefts, one aggravated assault.

36:51.927 --> 36:54.027
Working for a construction
company in Baghdad.

36:54.627 --> 36:57.327
- He was with Rankin when he was killed.
- Come on, DiNozzo,

36:57.427 --> 36:59.927
- you gotta give me more than that.
- Not done yet here.

36:59.962 --> 37:01.627
Got a link to the Iraqi database.

37:01.827 --> 37:04.127
Alan Hayes under investigation.

37:04.427 --> 37:08.027
Suspected of paying bribes to a
number of Iraqi nationals in the IZ,

37:08.227 --> 37:10.427
including none other than Ali Mahmoud.

37:11.027 --> 37:13.327
It wasn't a bribe. It was a hit fee.

37:13.427 --> 37:14.992
- Get me Hayes.
- Got it.

37:15.027 --> 37:17.427
It's too late, boss. He
got on a flight out of Iraq

37:17.462 --> 37:19.727
two hours ago. Arrives in DC at 18:00.

37:21.527 --> 37:23.427
You and Jardine are on
the first flight back.

37:23.462 --> 37:25.127
- Move it.
- On our way.

37:26.627 --> 37:28.727
Let's get the hell out of here.

37:30.127 --> 37:32.027
Need to find out if Hayes acted alone.

37:33.127 --> 37:34.927
Ridgeway's phone records.

37:35.327 --> 37:37.627
In the weeks prior to Rankin's death,

37:37.927 --> 37:40.027
Ridgeway called George
Stenner six times.

37:40.427 --> 37:43.327
Now, Ridgeway said that he didn't
know about Stenner or the soil tests.

37:44.227 --> 37:46.327
Captain Rankin's personal effects.

37:46.527 --> 37:48.127
Get me the Cloverfield phone.

37:48.727 --> 37:49.727
Ready?

37:50.927 --> 37:52.227
Yeah, just about.

37:53.227 --> 37:55.027
So, Major, when are you heading home?

37:55.427 --> 37:57.727
Five months, 16 days, two hours.

38:01.227 --> 38:02.927
- Ready.
- Good.

38:04.127 --> 38:06.027
Except for a small favor,

38:06.627 --> 38:08.127
just a little detour.

38:12.027 --> 38:13.992
You do remember Major Varnai telling us

38:14.027 --> 38:16.427
this is one of the most
dangerous areas in Baghdad?

38:16.827 --> 38:18.927
'Cause I remember it as
if it was this morning.

38:18.962 --> 38:21.027
Wait a second. It was this morning.

38:21.827 --> 38:23.427
Which makes me wonder...

38:23.627 --> 38:25.127
Why are we here now?

38:28.327 --> 38:31.127
You don't get out of the vehicle.
These guys freak when you do that.

38:34.627 --> 38:36.927
When Eric was shot, he almost died.

38:38.327 --> 38:40.127
A local man ran out,

38:40.627 --> 38:42.227
started giving him CPR.

38:42.827 --> 38:44.392
More Marines arrived,

38:44.427 --> 38:47.127
they saw Eric down, saw
an Iraqi standing over him.

38:47.827 --> 38:50.327
They thought he was an insurgent and...

38:51.627 --> 38:53.427
That was Jameel's father.

38:53.827 --> 38:56.227
There is no way I can repay the family.

38:57.327 --> 39:00.527
But I can at least make it a
little easier for one of them

39:00.562 --> 39:02.427
to communicate with the outside world.

39:05.427 --> 39:06.527
Perimeter.

39:10.827 --> 39:12.727
Dismount and secure the area!

39:29.927 --> 39:31.027
Tabina!

39:53.127 --> 39:55.427
Got the Cloverfield file
from Rankin's effects.

39:56.927 --> 39:58.627
The contract he signed is missing.

39:59.327 --> 40:02.327
Ridgeway was desperate to
get a signed contract back.

40:02.427 --> 40:05.627
He must have paid Hayes to
kill Rankin then steal it.

40:05.727 --> 40:06.927
Hayes probably has it.

40:10.627 --> 40:12.627
Stenner's report on the soil test.

40:14.727 --> 40:17.827
Same report Stenner gave us.
Heavy metal contaminations.

40:18.027 --> 40:20.327
It appears Rankin did his own research.

40:21.627 --> 40:23.727
Title searches from the 1920s.

40:24.327 --> 40:26.927
Looks like there used to be a
ceramics factory on the site.

40:27.027 --> 40:28.427
Ceramics means lead.

40:28.727 --> 40:30.927
So why would Rankin do his own research

40:31.027 --> 40:32.427
after he got Stenner's report?

40:33.027 --> 40:34.027
Gut feeling.

40:34.327 --> 40:35.727
You got a gut feeling, Boss?

40:35.927 --> 40:38.027
Yeah, but Captain Rankin did, too.

40:38.627 --> 40:39.827
Ziva, find Stenner.

40:42.527 --> 40:43.527
Let's go.

40:46.027 --> 40:48.392
Thanks. Hayes just cleared Customs.

40:48.427 --> 40:50.538
Think Ridgeway will meet him
here to pick up the contract?

40:50.562 --> 40:53.127
What makes you think that
Ridgeway did it, McGee?

40:58.927 --> 41:00.627
- There he is.
- Hold on.

41:02.727 --> 41:03.827
Let's go.

41:06.927 --> 41:08.427
Hello, Mr. Stenner.

41:10.527 --> 41:13.527
- This is not what you think.
- Who are these guys?

41:13.627 --> 41:16.127
- I'm guessing you two have met before?
- Years ago.

41:16.327 --> 41:18.827
We worked for the same construction
company. Is that a crime?

41:18.862 --> 41:20.427
No. Murder is.

41:25.427 --> 41:27.827
There's different results
here in your report.

41:27.862 --> 41:30.192
No mention of the
Cloverfield contamination.

41:30.227 --> 41:32.427
You switched it after
you killed Captain Rankin.

41:32.627 --> 41:35.727
- I didn't kill Rankin.
- You paid Ali Mahmoud to do it.

41:35.827 --> 41:36.927
Then you killed him.

41:38.827 --> 41:40.427
This was all his idea.

41:40.827 --> 41:42.627
I needed the money, okay?

41:44.127 --> 41:47.327
I showed Ridgeway my findings, he
wanted Rankin to sign the contract,

41:47.362 --> 41:49.527
so he paid me to doctor the report.

41:50.427 --> 41:52.192
Rankin did his own research.

41:52.227 --> 41:53.692
When he challenged your findings,

41:53.727 --> 41:56.492
you contacted your old
buddy Hayes here in Iraq,

41:56.527 --> 42:00.227
who arranged the mortar attack as
cover. Hayes paid Ali to shoot Rankin,

42:00.527 --> 42:03.327
then you silenced Ali
and swapped the reports.

42:03.627 --> 42:05.727
Rankin was gonna investigate me.

42:06.027 --> 42:08.427
I would have lost my
business, ruined my life.

42:08.462 --> 42:09.927
You just did that yourself.

42:20.127 --> 42:22.627
- Welcome back.
- Thank you. How's he been?

42:27.627 --> 42:28.727
Hey, Eric.

42:34.927 --> 42:36.327
I met Jameel.

42:37.327 --> 42:38.727
He has a sister.

42:39.127 --> 42:40.527
She is so sweet.

42:41.627 --> 42:44.627
They were so proud when I told
them that you were doing okay.

42:47.927 --> 42:49.827
I've got this amazing CD.

42:50.827 --> 42:52.227
You're gonna love it.

42:53.027 --> 42:54.827
Reminds me of the time...

42:55.427 --> 42:58.327
that weekend that Mom
and Dad took us camping.

43:01.227 --> 43:02.327
Remember?
