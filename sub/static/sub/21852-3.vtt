00:48.215 --> 00:49.467
Dude, what the hell
is going on?

00:49.633 --> 00:50.843
You didn't hear
the announcement?

00:51.010 --> 00:53.012
They just canceled
Columbus Day.

00:53.179 --> 00:54.430
We have to come to school
on Monday!

00:54.597 --> 00:56.057
They what?!

00:56.223 --> 00:58.100
They can't do this!
We made plans!

00:58.267 --> 00:59.894
Some asshole went
and convinced the school board

01:00.061 --> 01:02.021
that Columbus Day is racist
and should be eliminated.

01:02.188 --> 01:03.230
You can't take away
a day off.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.024
We're just
innocent children!

01:05.191 --> 01:07.818
Dude. What asshole would
take away a holiday?

01:07.985 --> 01:09.612
My name is Peter Galtman.

01:09.779 --> 01:12.698
I am the head of
the school calendar committee.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.283
I have decided the school

01:14.450 --> 01:16.160
will not celebrate
Columbus Day this year.

01:16.327 --> 01:17.578
I realize this is

01:17.745 --> 01:18.662
a hot-button issue
for many families,

01:18.829 --> 01:20.498
but one parent in particular

01:20.664 --> 01:23.042
has really swayed my opinion
with his passion --

01:23.209 --> 01:25.211
Mr. Randy Marsh.

01:25.377 --> 01:27.379
Mr. Marsh pointed out to me
the hypocrisy

01:27.546 --> 01:29.673
of glorifying
a genocidal murderer.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.676
And Mr. Marsh is, right now,
also working

01:32.843 --> 01:37.014
on having the Columbus statue
taken down in Canyon City.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.685
Come on, everybody!

01:41.852 --> 01:43.854
Let's take
this fuckin' thing down!

01:44.021 --> 01:46.315
Yeah!! Yeah!

01:46.482 --> 01:47.441
Take it down!

01:47.608 --> 01:50.820
Columbus was a mass murderer!

01:50.986 --> 01:53.280
Tear it down!
Tear it down!

01:53.447 --> 01:54.323
Yeah!

01:57.868 --> 02:00.121
Okay, it's not working.

02:00.287 --> 02:03.082
We almost got it, guys!

02:03.249 --> 02:04.834
Come on!
Throw the rope, Stan!

02:05.000 --> 02:06.502
Good. That's good!

02:06.669 --> 02:08.170
Okay,
hit the gas, Nelson!

02:09.880 --> 02:11.507
We got it,
everybody!

02:11.674 --> 02:13.008
To hell with you,
Columbus, you --

02:13.175 --> 02:14.510
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:21.016 --> 02:22.226
Hey, dude.

02:22.393 --> 02:24.270
Dude, did you know
it's <i>your</i> dad

02:24.436 --> 02:26.188
who's getting the school
to cancel Columbus Day?

02:26.355 --> 02:28.023
Yeah. Dude, I don't know
what's going on.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.567
He's really serious
about this.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.068
Well, you got to
do something.

02:31.235 --> 02:32.486
If you get him to back down,

02:32.653 --> 02:33.904
maybe the school
will reconsider.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.156
I can't get him
to back down.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.158
Stan, I have to deal
with my mom

02:37.324 --> 02:38.868
doing shit like this
all the time,

02:39.034 --> 02:41.078
but she's never tried
to take away a holiday.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.539
I'm your best friend,
but I can't have your back

02:43.706 --> 02:44.707
when the guys
find out about this.

02:44.874 --> 02:45.916
I'll try, okay?

02:46.083 --> 02:47.209
I got to go.

02:47.376 --> 02:48.878
Okay, Stan.
you got your phone?

02:49.044 --> 02:50.713
We need to call
everyone on this list.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.381
They all live
in the same city.

02:52.548 --> 02:54.800
Dad, listen, you need
to ease off a little here, okay?

02:54.967 --> 02:57.094
Stan, it's not right
that people celebrate a man

02:57.261 --> 02:58.345
who wiped out
millions of people

02:58.512 --> 03:00.514
for his own glory.
Let's go.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.893
Hello, is this, uh,
Howard Peterson?

03:04.059 --> 03:06.562
You live in Columbus, Ohio.
Is that correct?

03:06.729 --> 03:09.148
Yeah?
You racist piece of shit.

03:09.315 --> 03:10.316
You heard me.

03:10.482 --> 03:11.692
You're an
intolerant pig.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.527
Oh, you're not?

03:13.694 --> 03:15.487
You just choose to live in a
city named for ethnic cleansing?

03:15.654 --> 03:17.072
No, fuck you.

03:17.239 --> 03:18.866
Rename your city, asshole.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.492
Hello?

03:20.659 --> 03:22.119
Okay, next one.
Come on. Get calling, Stan.

03:22.286 --> 03:23.162
Dad, come on.

03:23.329 --> 03:24.580
We all get your point,

03:24.747 --> 03:26.165
but don't you think
you're overdoing it?

03:26.332 --> 03:27.958
You have to overdo
it in today's society, Stan.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.044
You can't be nuanced
and subtle anymore

03:30.211 --> 03:32.171
or else critics go, "Wow,
what was the point of that?"

03:32.338 --> 03:34.256
Hi, Francis Melman?

03:34.423 --> 03:36.592
Hey! How are you,
you fuckin' racist?

03:38.302 --> 03:40.304
Christopher Columbus --

03:40.471 --> 03:41.805
explorer, pioneer.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.099
Is he someone
who should be appreciated?

03:44.266 --> 03:46.518
Or was he
just a douche?

03:46.685 --> 03:48.562
For years. Columbus Circle
has been a landmark

03:48.729 --> 03:51.440
and photogenic intersection
in New York City.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.234
So it came as a surprise

03:53.400 --> 03:56.237
when someone defecated
on the statue earlier today.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.989
I'm joined now by the man
who did the actual defecating,

03:59.156 --> 04:01.575
Mr. Randy Marsh
of South Park, Colorado.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.244
Good evening!

04:03.410 --> 04:05.412
Mr. Marsh, you took a dump
on the beloved statue that

04:05.579 --> 04:07.039
has been an icon here
in the city for years.

04:07.206 --> 04:08.415
What was your reasoning?

04:08.582 --> 04:10.167
Well, I just
have a problem

04:10.334 --> 04:12.461
with the racist people
of this city.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.380
"Yee-haw!
I'm from New York.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.382
I drive around
a big circle

04:16.548 --> 04:18.634
that celebrates a guy
who murdered Native Americans.

04:18.801 --> 04:20.594
Shoo wee!"

04:20.761 --> 04:22.763
So, you're doing this
because of indigenous peoples

04:22.930 --> 04:24.390
and their feelings?

04:24.556 --> 04:26.100
I don't care
if people get indigenous.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.977
I'll crap all over
their statues.

04:28.143 --> 04:31.146
I'm the one who's indigenous
that this landmark even exists!

04:31.313 --> 04:34.608
Uh, uh...
ba-back to you, Tom.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.490
It ain't right.

04:41.657 --> 04:43.325
They make you
work like a dog

04:43.492 --> 04:45.577
and then just tear away
your one day off in October

04:45.744 --> 04:47.246
like you're
a piece of trash.

04:47.663 --> 04:48.789
Hey, guys.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.417
Boo! Boo!
Nobody likes you, Stan.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.793
Look, I tried talking
to him, all right?

04:52.960 --> 04:55.671
He's just really against
all the things Columbus did.

04:55.838 --> 04:57.548
Does anybody know
what Columbus actually did?

04:57.715 --> 05:00.801
Yeah. In 1492, Columbus got us
a day off school.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.219
That's what matters.

05:02.386 --> 05:03.887
No. No, wait, guys.
Maybe that's it.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.556
When I'm dealing
with my mom,

05:05.723 --> 05:07.516
sometimes it works to be
on her side for a minute.

05:07.683 --> 05:09.143
Maybe we should find out
all the things

05:09.310 --> 05:10.436
people find offensive
about Columbus and --

05:10.602 --> 05:11.603
And then totally act
like we care.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.522
I like it, Kyle.

05:13.689 --> 05:15.024
I'll just look up
"Columbus, offensive, inflammatory..."

05:15.190 --> 05:17.276
Yeah, this is sweet.

05:17.443 --> 05:19.361
It's like that movie where the dude pretended
to be on the monster's side.

05:19.528 --> 05:20.904
You know, with the guy and the chick
that had the wife beater on,

05:21.071 --> 05:22.072
but her boobs were sweaty
so you could see them.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.240
Oh, I love
that movie!

05:23.407 --> 05:24.325
Yeah, this is
a lot like that.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.784
What'd you find, Kyle?

05:25.951 --> 05:27.077
Nothing.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.330
Dang it!
There's nothing?

05:29.496 --> 05:31.915
Stan, can I talk to you
for a minute?

05:32.082 --> 05:34.543
What? What?
What the hell was that?

05:37.046 --> 05:37.921
Hey, Dad?

05:38.088 --> 05:39.506
Not now, Stan.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.091
I'm working on a proposal

05:41.258 --> 05:43.135
to change British Colombia
to just British.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.554
But, Dad, Kyle
found a picture on Instagram.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.389
It pretty much looks like you

05:47.556 --> 05:49.767
dressed as Columbus
at a Halloween party.

05:51.310 --> 05:52.561
Where did you get that?

05:52.728 --> 05:53.771
If you hate Columbus
so much,

05:53.937 --> 05:55.189
why'd you
dress up like him?

05:55.356 --> 05:57.358
Look, that was
a long time ago. Okay?

05:57.524 --> 05:59.234
Just a dumb
Halloween costume.

05:59.401 --> 06:00.736
Yeah, but...
here's you

06:00.903 --> 06:02.363
dressed as Columbus
at a formal dinner,

06:02.529 --> 06:03.113
and here's you
dressed as Columbus

06:03.280 --> 06:04.698
at a football game.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.784
And you as Columbus
on St. Patrick's day.

06:06.950 --> 06:10.037
Look, I was younger!
We were all younger.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.997
It was another time.

06:12.164 --> 06:15.334
You have to understand,
it was 2013.

06:15.501 --> 06:17.711
Everyone was stoked
on Columbus back then.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.089
Yeah, but, Dad, you seem to be
<i>really</i> stoked on Columbus.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.341
If you guys found
those pictures online,

06:22.508 --> 06:25.094
it's only a matter of time
before everyone else does.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.346
People won't care
about what I do now.

06:27.513 --> 06:28.972
They'll just see me

06:29.139 --> 06:32.351
as a thoughtless,
indigenous son of a bitch.

06:37.689 --> 06:40.401
Randy, do you mind cleaning out
the garage like I asked?

06:40.567 --> 06:41.902
What's the point, Sharon?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.779
Soon they're gonna be
coming after me.

06:43.946 --> 06:46.698
Ugh.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.575
<i>Hey, you!</i>

06:48.742 --> 06:50.411
<i>That's right, you!</i>

06:50.577 --> 06:53.163
<i>Wouldn't you like to know
the story of you?</i>

06:53.330 --> 06:55.374
<i>What makes you, you?</i>

06:55.541 --> 06:57.376
<i>DNAandMe
is a genetic service</i>

06:57.543 --> 06:59.128
<i>that can help you find out</i>

06:59.294 --> 07:01.088
<i>exactly who
your ancestors were.</i>

07:01.255 --> 07:02.798
<i>You might be surprised.</i>

07:02.965 --> 07:05.092
<i>I thought I was just
a standard white guy.</i>

07:05.259 --> 07:07.177
<i>But DNAandMe showed</i>

07:07.344 --> 07:10.848
<i>that I'm actually
4.2% Cherokee Indian.</i>

07:11.014 --> 07:13.058
<i>Turns out
I'm not totally white.</i>

07:13.225 --> 07:16.145
<i>I'm also part Northern Asian,
and even some Kurdish!</i>

07:16.311 --> 07:18.021
<i>I'm a victim of oppression!</i>

07:18.188 --> 07:20.858
<i>I used to get in trouble
for always using the "N" word.</i>

07:21.024 --> 07:25.070
<i>But with DNAandMe, I found out
that I'm 2. 1% black!</i>

07:25.237 --> 07:25.863
<i>Morning, Steve.</i>

07:26.029 --> 07:27.656
<i>'Sup, nigga.</i>

07:27.823 --> 07:29.241
<i>The test is easy.</i>

07:29.408 --> 07:30.784
<i>Simply swab
the inside of your mouth</i>

07:30.951 --> 07:32.494
<i>and send it in
to our labs.</i>

07:32.661 --> 07:34.621
<i>People made fun of me
for being French.</i>

07:34.788 --> 07:37.416
<i>DNAandMe showed
I was 8% Navajo.</i>

07:37.583 --> 07:39.001
<i>Nobody's making fun of me now,</i>

07:39.168 --> 07:40.836
<i>or my people,
who were victims.</i>

07:41.003 --> 07:42.754
<i>I'm 13% victim!</i>

07:42.921 --> 07:44.506
<i>I'm 21% victim.</i>

07:44.673 --> 07:46.425
<i>Order now and find out</i>

07:46.592 --> 07:48.760
<i>if your friends should be
more sympathetic towards you.</i>

07:48.927 --> 07:51.805
<i>DNAandMe.
Are you in?</i>

07:51.972 --> 07:53.849
Hell fuckin' yes,
I'm in.

08:07.488 --> 08:12.910
All right. Everyone's here.
Let's do this.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.495
Here you go,
just like I said.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.914
$100 cash.
No questions asked.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.499
Are we good?

08:19.416 --> 08:21.043
Good.
No talking. Perfect.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.795
Okay.
Let's get this over with.

08:34.806 --> 08:35.891
Thank you.

08:36.058 --> 08:38.435
Do not talk of this
to anyone.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.690
All right, everybody!
Hey, thanks for coming.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.150
If, uh, I can have
your attention, please,

08:45.317 --> 08:47.069
I think we're ready
to get started.

08:47.236 --> 08:48.570
Uh, Mr. Marsh, you know

08:48.737 --> 08:50.030
none of this
was really necessary.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.698
For DNAandMe testing,

08:51.865 --> 08:53.450
you can just swab the inside
of your mouth yourself

08:53.617 --> 08:55.244
and send it in the mail.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.329
Yeah, I know, but I just --
I was really excited about it,

08:57.496 --> 08:59.540
wanted everyone
to witness my test.

08:59.706 --> 09:00.874
Well, to each their own,
I suppose.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.459
All right.
Open wide.

09:02.626 --> 09:06.505
Ahh...

09:06.672 --> 09:08.090
Okay. I'll get this
back to the lab

09:08.257 --> 09:09.758
and get the results to you
as soon as possible.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.386
Okay, great.
I'm very interested to see

09:12.553 --> 09:15.722
what those results
have to say.

09:20.519 --> 09:22.104
Galtman residence.

09:22.271 --> 09:23.939
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

09:24.106 --> 09:26.066
<i>The man who convinced you
to cancel Columbus Day</i>

09:26.233 --> 09:27.442
<i>is a fraud.</i>

09:27.609 --> 09:28.986
Who is this?

09:29.152 --> 09:30.946
<i>You will go online
and search Instagram</i>

09:31.113 --> 09:33.073
<i>for images of Randy Marsh.</i>

09:33.240 --> 09:34.658
I most certainly
will not.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.119
<i>Randy Marsh is
a hypocrite and a fake.</i>

09:37.286 --> 09:40.205
<i>You will be taken down with him
when he is exposed.</i>

09:40.372 --> 09:41.123
What's he saying?

09:41.290 --> 09:42.666
Shh!
Mprphph mhprphm!

09:42.833 --> 09:44.167
<i>We know where you live,</i>

09:44.334 --> 09:46.169
<i>and we know how
to make you suffer.</i>

09:46.336 --> 09:48.338
Now you listen here,
Mr. Man.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.673
The Galtmans
do not believe

09:49.840 --> 09:51.508
in social media
or the Internet.

09:51.675 --> 09:54.177
It's all fake news.
Fake news.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.263
<i>Then speak
with Marsh yourself.</i>

09:56.430 --> 09:59.558
<i>The truth is out there.</i>

09:59.725 --> 10:00.892
Mrph. Rm rmhmhm
rm mrph rmhmhm.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.312
Hmmm. Sounds like
maybe the Galtmans

10:03.478 --> 10:05.063
need to check out
Randy Marsh.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.157
Shelley,
we've got an emergency!

10:15.324 --> 10:17.242
We're getting rid of all the
Columbus stuff in this house!

10:17.409 --> 10:19.077
Any Columbus costumes,
Columbus pictures --

10:19.244 --> 10:20.495
They all got to go!

10:20.662 --> 10:22.664
I don't give a shit
about Columbus.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.042
Sharon,
Peter Galtman called.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.418
He sounds suspicious.
We got to get rid

10:26.585 --> 10:27.669
of all our Columbus shot glasses
and coffee cups.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.463
Where are they?

10:29.630 --> 10:31.465
<i>Your</i> Columbus shot glasses
and coffee cups

10:31.632 --> 10:33.091
are in that cupboard.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.261
Shot glasses, coffee cups,
towels, plates --

10:36.428 --> 10:38.680
What about the Columbus figurine
salt and pepper shakers?

10:38.847 --> 10:41.099
I don't know where
you put them, Randy.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.684
Sharon, do you know
what they'll do to us

10:42.851 --> 10:44.895
when they find out how stoked
we were on Columbus?

10:45.062 --> 10:47.522
<i>You</i> were stoked on Columbus,
Randy. Not me.

10:47.689 --> 10:48.649
Oh, really?!

10:48.815 --> 10:50.442
Did you forget
our wedding?!

10:50.609 --> 10:52.194
That's you right there,

10:52.361 --> 10:53.862
standing there
with a big smile on your face.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.530
You didn't say
anything about it

10:55.697 --> 10:56.948
being insensitive then,
did you?

10:57.115 --> 10:58.575
I actually was
a little upset

10:58.742 --> 11:00.077
that you dressed up as Columbus
for our wedding,

11:00.243 --> 11:02.037
- but I decided --
- Oh, now!

11:02.204 --> 11:04.706
You say that now, 'cause
everyone's freaking out.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.084
But you were right there,
going along with it!

11:07.250 --> 11:10.337
They're gonna be coming
after you, too, Sharon!

11:10.504 --> 11:12.506
So you can just wipe that
indigenous look off your face.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.176
Oh! That could be
my DNA results!

11:16.343 --> 11:18.470
Here, take this stuff
out back!

11:26.478 --> 11:28.939
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

11:29.106 --> 11:32.901
I've never felt so alive
until now.

11:33.068 --> 11:35.987
Thank you.
Lo-Lovely flowers. Thank you.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.575
Galtman residence.

11:40.742 --> 11:42.577
<i>Listen carefully
if you want to live.</i>

11:42.744 --> 11:45.539
<i>You will make this Monday
a school holiday.</i>

11:45.706 --> 11:48.709
I spoke with Mr. Marsh,
and he denied any wrong doing.

11:48.875 --> 11:49.876
<i>Of course he did!</i>

11:50.043 --> 11:51.586
<i>That's what liars do!</i>

11:51.753 --> 11:53.338
I don't think you're being
intimidating enough.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.174
Yeah, get meaner, Kenny.
<i>Meaner like how, dude?</i>

11:56.341 --> 11:57.718
<i>I don't know, like -- like maybe say --</i>

11:57.884 --> 11:59.094
<i>Like talk about cutting off
his dick or something.</i>

11:59.261 --> 12:00.929
<i>We're gonna
cut off your dick!</i>

12:01.096 --> 12:02.848
<i> No, dude.
That's too far.</i>

12:03.014 --> 12:04.516
<i>Okay, okay, just say we're gonna cut off
part of his dick.</i>

12:04.683 --> 12:05.767
<i>Just give me
the phone.</i>

12:05.934 --> 12:07.227
<i>- Hello?</i>
- What?

12:07.394 --> 12:09.396
<i>Randy Marsh is about to pay
for what he's done.</i>

12:09.563 --> 12:10.897
<i>Protect him
and you will pay, too.</i>

12:11.064 --> 12:13.358
Time is running out.

12:13.525 --> 12:14.526
Jesus!

12:15.819 --> 12:18.822
Sharon, have you seen
my Columbus staff and orb?

12:18.989 --> 12:20.615
I have not.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.284
Sharon, Galtman
called again.

12:22.451 --> 12:24.244
Somebody is out there trying to
get me in trouble.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.663
Randy, why don't you just
admit to people

12:26.830 --> 12:28.999
that maybe you were
somewhat overly excited

12:29.166 --> 12:31.585
about Columbus in the past.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.962
Everyone was excited
about Columbus!

12:34.129 --> 12:36.256
For some reason, people are just
pointing fingers at me.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.216
Just because he's suddenly
not cool now

12:38.383 --> 12:40.969
doesn't mean I'm gonna be
the F'ing scapegoat!

12:42.554 --> 12:45.974
I got to burn
this stuff.

12:46.141 --> 12:47.976
Oh, God damn it.

12:48.143 --> 12:52.230
I wrote you a song
to express my feelings for you.

12:52.397 --> 12:53.482
Will you
get out of here?!

12:58.737 --> 13:02.032
♪ And then he kissed me ♪

13:02.199 --> 13:03.533
I didn't kiss you
'cause I like you.

13:07.621 --> 13:10.624
♪ And then he kissed me ♪

13:10.791 --> 13:12.167
Okay, okay.

13:14.377 --> 13:17.380
♪ And the sun
began to shine ♪

13:17.547 --> 13:19.674
That's it.
Get off my property!

13:19.841 --> 13:21.718
Randy,
I cannot quit you.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.387
Get off my land,
you piece of shit!

13:30.852 --> 13:32.020
Don't post that.

13:34.773 --> 13:38.360
Do not...post that.

13:38.527 --> 13:40.028
Shit!

13:43.907 --> 13:44.825
Guys, what are
you doing?

13:44.991 --> 13:46.409
It's over, Eric.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.078
We have to come to school
on Monday.

13:48.245 --> 13:49.621
Just face it.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.414
I'm not facing anything.
We still have time.

13:51.581 --> 13:52.666
There has to be
a way we can --

13:52.833 --> 13:54.459
Dude, there's nothing
we can do, all right?

13:54.626 --> 13:57.254
Oh, okay. I see.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.506
Is that what Columbus did?
Just give up?

13:59.673 --> 14:02.592
On his dream?
No.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.345
Columbus believed that kids
should have a day off school.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.764
And even when his own country
wouldn't support his cause,

14:07.931 --> 14:10.141
Columbus said, "Fine.
I'll go find a new land

14:10.308 --> 14:11.810
where kids
can have that day off."

14:11.977 --> 14:13.311
Eric, just let it go.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.647
And when Columbus
sailed to distant places

14:15.814 --> 14:17.274
only to find people
already there

14:17.440 --> 14:19.109
who said, "No!
Stay off our land!

14:19.276 --> 14:21.194
We want our kids
to have to go to school!"

14:21.361 --> 14:23.321
He said, "No!
It's just one day in October.

14:23.488 --> 14:24.990
They need a break!"

14:25.156 --> 14:27.701
You guys can all give up,
but I'm not.

14:27.868 --> 14:32.789
Because in 1492, Columbus
got us all a day off school.

14:32.956 --> 14:35.166
With just three ships,
he sailed over

14:35.333 --> 14:38.253
so we could have
some 'me time' in October.

14:38.420 --> 14:39.963
And, yes,
millions were slaughtered

14:40.130 --> 14:41.423
and throats were cut.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.675
But if we don't get
that day off school,

14:43.842 --> 14:47.637
then for what?

14:47.804 --> 14:49.222
Come on, guys.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.432
There's something else
we can try.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.814
- Sharon, good news!
- What?!

14:57.981 --> 14:59.566
The people from the DNA test
called!

14:59.733 --> 15:00.984
They're on their way over.
You want to come down?

15:01.151 --> 15:02.611
I'm doing something.

15:02.777 --> 15:03.737
You sure?

15:03.904 --> 15:05.697
These results could
be really interesting.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.492
Oh, God damn it!
What the hell do you want?

15:09.659 --> 15:12.579
I want you to stop
running from yourself.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.331
We could be so happy.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.250
Crap, it's them!

15:17.417 --> 15:19.127
Just a second! Be right there!
Thanks!

15:19.294 --> 15:21.004
Get over here!

15:21.171 --> 15:23.214
I don't have any feelings
for you. Do you understand?

15:23.381 --> 15:25.508
But, Randy,
what about the --

15:25.675 --> 15:28.178
No! No buts!
There's nothing here.

15:28.345 --> 15:31.473
I'm not in love with you,
got it?!

15:31.640 --> 15:32.933
Yes.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.935
Yes, I understand.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.437
Good. Now leave.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.943
Hi. Sorry.
You guys have my results?

15:43.109 --> 15:44.861
Well, Mr. Marsh,
we came because

15:45.028 --> 15:47.864
there was an irregularity
with your test.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.658
What, you found something there
you didn't expect to find?

15:49.824 --> 15:51.034
What is it?

15:51.201 --> 15:52.619
Well, it's just
a little too odd.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.245
We need to do
the test again.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.789
Do it again?
That's not fair.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.165
Mr. Marsh, please,

15:57.332 --> 15:58.541
if we could just have
one more sample.

15:58.708 --> 15:59.960
We want to be
absolutely sure

16:00.126 --> 16:01.002
of what we found.

16:01.169 --> 16:02.837
Uh...okay,
no problem.

16:03.004 --> 16:06.257
Give me -- Give me
one sec. I'll be right back.

16:06.424 --> 16:09.010
Wait! Wait!

16:17.394 --> 16:19.270
Okay. Okay.
All set. Let's do this.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.022
Ahh!

16:21.189 --> 16:23.692
Mr. Marsh, we were hoping
to do a more precise test.

16:23.858 --> 16:25.443
It's better
for harder cases like this,

16:25.610 --> 16:29.280
but it is an anal swab
this time.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.116
An anal swab?

16:31.282 --> 16:34.577
Give me..
tw-- three minutes.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.454
Hey, where'd you go?

16:36.621 --> 16:37.747
Mr. Marsh, we're in
a bit of a hurry

16:37.914 --> 16:39.165
if you don't mind.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.002
Oh.
Oh, shit.

16:51.761 --> 16:54.139
All right, it's clear.
Bring him in.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.515
Move your ass,
Galtman!

16:55.682 --> 16:57.017
This is a violation
of my rights.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.560
Just shut up
and watch

16:58.727 --> 17:00.145
what someone posted
on their Instagram!

17:00.311 --> 17:02.147
I most certainly
will not!

17:02.313 --> 17:04.482
If you want me to look at
the internet, I will die first.

17:04.649 --> 17:05.650
It's fake news.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.320
That's why we had it
transferred to VHS.

17:09.487 --> 17:10.363
Oh.
VHS is fine.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.073
Take off
his blindfold.

17:14.075 --> 17:16.578
<i>Get off my land,
you piece of shit!</i>

17:18.955 --> 17:20.123
<i>Don't post that.</i>

17:20.290 --> 17:21.541
Hmm.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.641
Oh, Mr. Marsh.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.978
Oh, hey!
How are you?

17:42.145 --> 17:44.814
Good.
What are you up to?

17:44.981 --> 17:47.692
Chillin', chillin'.

17:47.859 --> 17:51.029
Well, uh, we did get your DNA
results back this morning.

17:51.196 --> 17:52.447
Would you like to go over them?

17:52.614 --> 17:54.324
Oh, you did?
Oh, great.

17:54.491 --> 17:56.534
Sure.
Why not? I'm here.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.411
Let's, uh...
Let's do that.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.871
All right, Mr. Marsh,

18:00.038 --> 18:01.623
here's your
DNAandMe portfolio.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.875
This shows
that we actually found

18:04.042 --> 18:06.503
a mix of a few things
in your regional ancestry.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.963
Really? Like Native American?!
Like -- Like a little bit?!

18:09.130 --> 18:10.840
No, we didn't find any trace

18:11.007 --> 18:13.009
of any Native American DNA
in your test...

18:13.176 --> 18:15.053
Nuts.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.846
But as you can see here,
we found

18:17.013 --> 18:19.057
that you're about
43% Northern European,

18:19.224 --> 18:20.850
37% Mediterranean,

18:21.017 --> 18:23.311
and 18% Southwest Asian.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.064
In fact, your genetic profile
most closely matches...

18:26.231 --> 18:28.233
your standard
Caucasian British person.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.402
And you might
be interested to know

18:31.569 --> 18:34.614
that you are actually
2.8 % Neanderthal,

18:34.781 --> 18:35.782
which is fairly high.

18:35.949 --> 18:36.991
Neanderthal?

18:37.158 --> 18:38.493
What the hell is that about?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.453
Well, the Neanderthals
were actually a species

18:40.620 --> 18:42.080
that was wiped out
by homo sapiens.

18:42.247 --> 18:44.958
Wiped out...
all of my people?

18:45.125 --> 18:46.918
Yes, but you see,
because of some cross breeding,

18:47.085 --> 18:49.045
some people like you
still possess

18:49.212 --> 18:50.046
Neanderthal DNA.

18:50.213 --> 18:51.297
Isn't that interesting?

18:51.464 --> 18:54.092
Cross breeding?
You mean rape.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.553
You're telling me
that my ancestors

18:56.719 --> 18:59.139
were raped
and then eradicated by you --

18:59.305 --> 19:01.724
you maniacs?!

19:01.891 --> 19:03.852
The Earth wasn't big enough
for Neanderthals,

19:04.018 --> 19:06.521
So your ancestors
just got rid of them, huh?!

19:06.688 --> 19:09.774
Well, to hell with all of you!

19:19.659 --> 19:22.495
Well, well.
Mr. Marsh.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.997
I'd like to have a word, please.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.335
You find this funny,
Galtman?!

19:29.502 --> 19:30.962
What'd I do?

19:31.129 --> 19:32.463
Nobody had the guts

19:32.630 --> 19:34.465
to tell me what happened
to my people, huh?

19:34.632 --> 19:36.301
Get the hell out of here!

19:36.467 --> 19:39.512
I brought my parents over
so you could meet them.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.307
Oh, God!

19:42.473 --> 19:43.683
Don't worry.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.978
My parents are very okay
and cool with us.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.730
Who the hell is that?

19:48.897 --> 19:51.274
Yeah, sure, everyone gang up
on the Neanderthal!

19:51.441 --> 19:52.525
Isn't it funny?!

19:52.692 --> 19:55.361
Randy, you must face
who you are.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.739
Stop pretending, Randy.

19:57.906 --> 20:02.118
For once, just allow
yourself to feel.

20:04.787 --> 20:08.249
You're right.
You're right.

20:08.416 --> 20:12.128
It's only now, when everyone's
being so indigenous to me,

20:12.295 --> 20:16.007
That I realize how indigenous
I've been acting all along.

20:16.174 --> 20:19.344
I thought being a victim
would solve all my problems.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.971
But being a victim
has a downside, too.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.933
Mr. Galtman,
I haven't been honest.

20:25.099 --> 20:29.229
It's time for us all
to be honest.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.565
What is a holiday?

20:32.732 --> 20:35.818
It's a day off work, yes,
a day off school.

20:35.985 --> 20:39.781
But holidays are also meant
to be a time to reflect.

20:39.948 --> 20:42.533
Today, I'm happy to announce

20:42.700 --> 20:44.327
that the school calendar
committee

20:44.494 --> 20:46.329
is reinstating the day off.

20:48.373 --> 20:51.000
But instead
of glorifying anyone,

20:51.167 --> 20:52.961
let us make it a holiday

20:53.127 --> 20:56.089
about the negative feelings
that we all sometimes feel,

20:56.256 --> 20:59.175
say what we're really thinking
so we can move on.

20:59.342 --> 21:01.302
And so, the second Monday
of October

21:01.469 --> 21:03.221
will still be a holiday.

21:03.388 --> 21:04.931
But instead of Columbus Day,

21:05.098 --> 21:06.557
it will be
for ripping on each other

21:06.724 --> 21:08.184
and tearing each other down,

21:08.351 --> 21:11.062
and we will call it
Indigenous Peoples Day.

21:11.229 --> 21:14.065
For, perhaps, if we all do it
at the same time,

21:14.232 --> 21:17.026
we won't be so indigenous
the rest of the year.

21:17.193 --> 21:19.862
And since this is the second
Monday of October,

21:20.029 --> 21:22.240
let's all embrace
the new meaning of the holiday

21:22.407 --> 21:23.533
starting right now.

21:23.700 --> 21:25.076
Do you even know

21:25.243 --> 21:26.828
what indigenous means,
you frickin' idiot?

21:26.995 --> 21:28.496
That's the spirit, Dave!
Come on!

21:28.663 --> 21:30.623
Everybody, let's just all
be totally indigenous!

21:30.790 --> 21:31.291
Come on!

21:31.457 --> 21:34.043
Who the hell let this guy
talk to the school counsel?

21:34.210 --> 21:35.878
Good one, Kurt.
Your wife's a whore.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.297
Come on, everyone!

21:37.463 --> 21:39.048
Indigenous Peoples Day!
Let's go for it!

21:39.215 --> 21:41.050
Shut up,
and get off the podium!

21:41.217 --> 21:43.261
Okay.
I will in a second, fatso.

21:43.428 --> 21:44.637
All right.
Who else?

21:44.804 --> 21:46.306
Come on!
Get it out of your system!

21:46.472 --> 21:48.099
Happy Indigenous Peoples Day,
everyone.

21:48.266 --> 21:49.100
Suck my asshole.
