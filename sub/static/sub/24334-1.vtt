WEBVTT

00:02.995 --> 00:04.997
(children laughing
and chatting in distance)

00:30.189 --> 00:33.259
* Ooh, ooh *

00:37.596 --> 00:39.598
* Wah *

00:44.670 --> 00:48.140
It's Tuesday, right?

00:48.174 --> 00:50.309
What is?

00:50.342 --> 00:53.011
Today. I'm asking--
is it Tuesday?

00:56.448 --> 00:58.750
This is a conversation
about time.

00:58.784 --> 01:02.521
I try never to have
conversations about time.

01:03.855 --> 01:09.128
* Ooh, ooh, ooh *

01:12.298 --> 01:15.667
Whoops, my drink is empty.

01:15.701 --> 01:18.070
LENNY:
Hmm.

01:18.104 --> 01:20.206
Oh. Thanks.

01:20.239 --> 01:22.574
*

01:33.552 --> 01:35.287
Is something funny?

01:35.321 --> 01:37.189
:
Yes.

01:37.223 --> 01:39.458
We're trapped.

01:56.108 --> 01:58.110
MAN :
A labyrinth.

02:14.293 --> 02:16.662
Groovy.

02:19.030 --> 02:22.168
NARRATOR:
There is a maze in the desert

02:22.201 --> 02:24.736
carved from sand and rock.

02:24.770 --> 02:28.174
A vast labyrinth of pathways
and corridors

02:28.207 --> 02:31.943
a hundred miles long,
a thousand miles wide,

02:31.977 --> 02:35.414
full of twists and dead ends.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.683
Picture it-- a puzzle.

02:37.716 --> 02:40.686
You walk,
and at the end of this maze

02:40.719 --> 02:44.022
is a prize
just waiting to be discovered.

02:44.055 --> 02:47.593
All you have to do
is find your way through.

02:50.329 --> 02:54.266
Its walls and floors,
its twists and turns?

02:54.300 --> 02:58.103
Good, because the maze
you've created in your mind

02:58.136 --> 03:00.539
is itself the maze.

03:00.572 --> 03:04.009
There is no desert,
no rock or sand.

03:04.042 --> 03:07.379
There is only the idea of it.

03:07.413 --> 03:10.482
But it's an idea
that will come to dominate

03:10.516 --> 03:12.884
your every waking
and sleeping moment.

03:12.918 --> 03:15.954
You're inside the maze now.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.156
You cannot escape.

03:18.190 --> 03:20.992
Welcome to madness.

04:05.771 --> 04:08.106
-CLARK: It's okay.

04:08.139 --> 04:10.276
Help them.

04:11.477 --> 04:14.246
Who?

04:14.280 --> 04:17.048
They're in the maze.

04:48.013 --> 04:50.015
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

04:55.020 --> 04:57.022
(indistinct announcement
continues over P.A.)

05:05.196 --> 05:06.565
(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

05:06.598 --> 05:09.501
David, can you hear me?

05:11.937 --> 05:16.174
Listen, we have you now.
You're safe.

05:16.207 --> 05:18.677
Welcome to Division 3.

05:33.725 --> 05:35.093
MAN :
Reminder:

05:35.126 --> 05:38.464
beware of ideas
that are not your own.

05:38.497 --> 05:40.932
-Reminder: beware of ideas

05:40.966 --> 05:43.168
that are not your own.

05:43.201 --> 05:45.036
(footsteps approaching,
door opens)

05:45.070 --> 05:46.472
KERRY:
They found him.

05:46.505 --> 05:47.773
SYD:
Who?

05:47.806 --> 05:49.641
KERRY:
I hate it when you do that.

05:49.675 --> 05:50.942
SYD:
I'm practicing.

05:53.712 --> 05:56.014
Who'd they find?

05:56.047 --> 05:58.650
David.

06:09.728 --> 06:11.730
*

06:31.617 --> 06:33.619
(man speaking Japanese
over speaker)

06:37.188 --> 06:40.191
ORWELL:
His blood pressure is 90/120.

06:40.225 --> 06:42.594
CARY:
Just like the others.

06:42.628 --> 06:43.895
ORWELL:
Is he infected?

06:43.929 --> 06:46.498
I don't think so.

06:46.532 --> 06:49.768
His brain function is consistent
with my previous scan.

06:49.801 --> 06:51.570
ORWELL:
So why doesn't he respond?

06:51.603 --> 06:53.104
CARY:
I don't know.

07:00.278 --> 07:02.681
It's possible that
his mind is locked

07:02.714 --> 07:04.049
in the astral plane.

07:04.082 --> 07:06.084
(machine whirring,
rhythmic breathing)

07:12.323 --> 07:15.060
We've seen it before.

07:20.632 --> 07:22.734
Master says
if there is any risk

07:22.768 --> 07:25.270
The telepath is infected,
we should terminate.

07:25.303 --> 07:26.638
CLARK:
No.

07:26.672 --> 07:29.908
His mind is strong.
He can resist it.

07:29.941 --> 07:31.577
You'll see.

07:40.852 --> 07:43.655
-This is ridiculous.

07:43.689 --> 07:45.223
-ORWELL: Dr. Loudermilk.
-CARY: David.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.859
-David.

07:49.695 --> 07:51.262
David.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.264
(man speaking indistinctly
over speaker)

07:55.467 --> 07:58.003
MAN :
702.

08:01.339 --> 08:04.776
CARY: David, if you can hear me,
speak to me.

08:04.810 --> 08:06.712
(man speaking indistinctly
over speaker)

08:10.148 --> 08:12.317
David.

08:21.727 --> 08:23.161
Kerry!

08:30.969 --> 08:32.971
Hey, boys.

08:36.742 --> 08:39.310
Retreat.

08:39.344 --> 08:41.680
(alarm stops,
weapons whoosh down)

08:46.818 --> 08:51.222
David, if you can hear me,
I need you to say something.

08:59.264 --> 09:01.600
Do you have any waffles?

09:15.346 --> 09:16.982
MAN :
Announcement four.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.885
Any shift in reality
may signal an attack.

09:19.918 --> 09:23.855
If you feel something,
say something.

09:33.765 --> 09:36.602
What are we so afraid of?

09:36.635 --> 09:38.069
Everybody here,
this whole building--

09:38.103 --> 09:39.905
that's all I can hear.

09:39.938 --> 09:41.873
Where are we, by the way?

09:41.907 --> 09:44.275
What happened to Summerland?

09:45.811 --> 09:47.713
This is Division 3.

09:47.746 --> 09:49.715
Headquarters.

09:52.951 --> 09:55.453
Is there a guy with, like, a...

09:55.486 --> 09:57.789
a basket on his head?

09:57.823 --> 09:59.758
Admiral Fukyama.

09:59.791 --> 10:02.360
He's the... boss.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.895
Our boss.

10:03.929 --> 10:05.764
Hmm.

10:05.797 --> 10:07.265
What do...
what does that mean?

10:07.298 --> 10:09.400
We work for Division 3 now.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.970
Hmm?
Since when?

10:13.571 --> 10:15.774
Wait. Were there...

10:15.807 --> 10:18.109
women with mustaches, singing?

10:18.143 --> 10:21.947
After the Lazarus Affair,

10:21.980 --> 10:24.616
the divisions were created
to study and defend against

10:24.650 --> 10:27.285
what people saw as
a new mutant threat.

10:29.187 --> 10:33.992
Division 1 is global command
and communications.

10:34.025 --> 10:36.895
Division 2 is pure science--

10:36.928 --> 10:39.631
genetics, technology.

10:39.665 --> 10:43.669
Division 3 is the tip
of the spear.

10:43.702 --> 10:48.707
We do the day-to-day
boots-on-the-ground engagement.

10:51.309 --> 10:54.145
(whirring,
indistinct male voice over P.A.)

11:06.324 --> 11:08.326
(indistinct voice over P.A.,
rhythmic grunting)

11:16.802 --> 11:19.004
After you left, Syd and Melanie

11:19.037 --> 11:20.706
convinced the leadership
that mutants themselves

11:20.739 --> 11:22.107
aren't a threat.

11:22.140 --> 11:25.276
Most of us are... harmless.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.578
We just want to live
our lives in peace.

11:32.918 --> 11:34.319
(indistinct male voice
over P.A.)

11:34.352 --> 11:36.621
So we joined Division 3

11:36.654 --> 11:39.891
and started working together
to fight our real enemies.

11:44.529 --> 11:49.167
Your friend, the Shadow King,

11:49.200 --> 11:53.705
he's been priority one
since the day you...

11:53.739 --> 11:56.875
left.

11:56.908 --> 11:58.910
Well... you mean
since yesterday.

12:00.511 --> 12:04.349
(indistinct female voice
over P.A.)

12:04.382 --> 12:06.284
What's the last thing
you remember?

12:07.753 --> 12:09.921
Uh...

12:12.390 --> 12:14.225
Uh...

12:16.461 --> 12:18.897
Well, Farouk escaped

12:18.930 --> 12:20.866
in Oliver's body,

12:20.899 --> 12:24.369
and we were--
Syd and I were on the balcony.

12:24.402 --> 12:28.740
And I could sense him
heading south.

12:28.774 --> 12:30.075
South.

12:30.108 --> 12:32.944
And then there was an orb.

12:32.978 --> 12:35.747
-SYD: No!

12:35.781 --> 12:37.115
-Syd!

12:37.148 --> 12:40.952
And it zapped me with,
like, a-a-a ray.

12:40.986 --> 12:43.054
:
Why are they children?

12:43.088 --> 12:45.023
Under a certain age,
we can't be infected.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.424
No one knows why.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.795
Infected?
With

12:49.828 --> 12:51.062
We'll...

12:51.096 --> 12:53.264
get to that.

12:54.800 --> 12:58.736
But you're saying
you got no memories at all

12:58.770 --> 13:00.738
after leaving Summerland?

13:00.772 --> 13:04.976
No. Well, I-I remember...

13:05.010 --> 13:08.079
trees, I guess, and...

13:08.113 --> 13:10.715
being on a roof downtown, and...

13:17.588 --> 13:19.557
...dancing?

13:21.526 --> 13:23.962
Then there's flashes...

13:23.995 --> 13:25.430
David, that was...

13:26.764 --> 13:28.733
MAN :
New symptom alert.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.468
Unexplained malaise.

13:30.501 --> 13:32.003
We'll talk later.

13:36.975 --> 13:40.345
Okay.

13:40.378 --> 13:42.347
-DAVID 2: Calm down.

13:42.380 --> 13:44.649
-DAVID 1: I think he knows.
-DAVID 2: He doesn't know.

13:44.682 --> 13:48.019
DAVID 1: Then why'd he leave?
That was weird.

13:48.053 --> 13:51.322
Are you the magic man?

13:54.792 --> 13:56.828
Hey.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.240
Huh.

14:11.142 --> 14:12.978
You look the same.

14:17.682 --> 14:20.151
Thanks.
You look great.

14:20.185 --> 14:21.953
SYD:
You left me.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.721
DAVID:
I didn't mean to.

14:23.754 --> 14:25.623
I was taken.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.758
I'm sorry if I scared you.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.496
We thought you were dead.

14:31.529 --> 14:32.898
When?

14:32.931 --> 14:34.365
For about a year.

14:34.399 --> 14:37.835
-For about...
-362 days,

14:37.869 --> 14:42.007
if we're being precise.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.675
I found a gray hair.

14:44.709 --> 14:47.312
I like cherry pie now.

14:47.345 --> 14:48.746
So...

14:52.117 --> 14:55.120
Where you been?

14:59.190 --> 15:02.860
Well, I-I was with you,
and then...

15:02.894 --> 15:05.696
I was inside the sphere
and the...

15:05.730 --> 15:07.732
But that was yesterday,
wasn't it?

15:13.471 --> 15:17.142
I used to play
these games with myself.

15:20.311 --> 15:22.113
If I can hold my breath

15:22.147 --> 15:24.682
until the kettle whistles,

15:24.715 --> 15:27.418
he's alive.

15:58.683 --> 16:01.152
Syd.

16:06.657 --> 16:08.859
What?

16:13.798 --> 16:15.766
Can I kiss you?

16:15.800 --> 16:18.569
You better.

16:25.476 --> 16:28.479
("We Love You"
by The Rolling Stones playing)

16:54.805 --> 16:57.442
* We don't care if you *

16:57.475 --> 16:59.710
* Only love we *

16:59.744 --> 17:05.283
* We don't care
if you only love we *

17:05.316 --> 17:06.984
* Ah! *

17:25.770 --> 17:29.974
SYD:
He's still inside Oliver.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.177
We know that.

17:35.080 --> 17:38.216
There have been sightings
around the world.

17:38.249 --> 17:41.052
He's looking for something.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.789
We think.

17:46.624 --> 17:49.227
We came close to finding him
a couple of times.

17:57.468 --> 18:01.439
Then we got distracted
by this thing.

18:01.472 --> 18:03.908
The Catalyst.

18:09.747 --> 18:14.018
We thought it was
a weapon at first.

18:14.051 --> 18:17.888
Some kind of biological agent.

18:17.922 --> 18:20.558
Normal people would...

18:20.591 --> 18:22.393
freeze like statues,

18:22.427 --> 18:24.629
except for that creepy thing
they do with their teeth.

18:28.299 --> 18:31.736
Then we realized,
every time it happened,

18:31.769 --> 18:34.372
Oliver was there.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.407
(garbled radio chatter,
teeth chattering)

18:46.016 --> 18:48.486
SYD: We think
he's infecting people somehow.

18:48.519 --> 18:50.321
It's not a virus,

18:50.355 --> 18:53.124
not a physical virus.

18:53.158 --> 18:56.227
Cary thinks it's...

18:56.261 --> 18:58.263
psychological.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.600
MAN :
Announcement two.

19:02.633 --> 19:04.769
Know your symptoms.

19:04.802 --> 19:06.504
Confusion.

19:06.537 --> 19:08.406
Irritability.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.508
Obsessive thoughts.

19:10.541 --> 19:12.843
Repetitive sounds.

19:12.877 --> 19:15.346
Repetitive
sounds.

19:15.380 --> 19:17.182
Hopelessness.

19:17.215 --> 19:19.016
Despair.

19:19.049 --> 19:21.319
If you feel any
of these symptoms,

19:21.352 --> 19:24.355
tell your mental monitor
at once.

19:24.389 --> 19:25.856
Syd.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.693
Syd.

19:36.501 --> 19:38.403
Sit.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.211
So...

19:46.244 --> 19:48.813
He's back.

19:48.846 --> 19:51.516
This morning. He looks good.

19:51.549 --> 19:54.719
Hmm. Oh, they always do.

19:54.752 --> 19:56.387
Our men,

19:56.421 --> 19:58.689
with all their in, out.

19:58.723 --> 20:01.859
In, out.

20:01.892 --> 20:05.696
All their important
things to do.

20:05.730 --> 20:07.732
"World's not gonna
save itself, dear."

20:07.765 --> 20:10.167
And off they go.

20:10.201 --> 20:13.904
A day, a month.

20:13.938 --> 20:17.675
A year.

20:17.708 --> 20:20.878
Forever.

20:20.911 --> 20:25.683
Admiral Fukyama asked if you're
ready to get back to work.

20:25.716 --> 20:28.853
-We need you.
-It's how they control us.

20:28.886 --> 20:31.422
Their absence...

20:31.456 --> 20:34.592
distracts us from our lives,

20:34.625 --> 20:36.627
the things that matter.

20:40.298 --> 20:41.899
I'm not sure
what you're trying...

20:41.932 --> 20:45.770
Course, it's never their fault,
our men.

20:45.803 --> 20:47.772
God forbid

20:47.805 --> 20:51.075
we should have
a feeling about it.

20:51.108 --> 20:54.612
What choice do they have?

20:54.645 --> 20:58.182
Destiny calls.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.185
What kind of bitches would we be
to stand in their way?

21:24.509 --> 21:28.045
Do you know what
the saddest words are

21:28.078 --> 21:30.080
in the English language?

21:32.817 --> 21:34.785
"Vacant lot."

21:36.854 --> 21:39.424
Don't know why.

21:39.457 --> 21:41.091
Vacant lot.

21:45.530 --> 21:49.266
I'm gonna...

21:49.300 --> 21:51.602
Cary finished the tank.

21:53.604 --> 21:57.475
David's gonna find Oliver,
and he's gonna bring him home.

21:57.508 --> 21:59.310
You'll see.

21:59.344 --> 22:02.513
Here's what they don't tell you.

22:02.547 --> 22:06.584
After they come back...

22:06.617 --> 22:08.619
things are never the same.

22:16.461 --> 22:19.464
("I Would for You"
by Jane's Addiction playing)

22:29.306 --> 22:32.242
* Oh, baby *

22:35.913 --> 22:39.183
* I'm so tired *

22:43.821 --> 22:46.156
* The man from the government *

22:47.592 --> 22:51.028
* The man from the tax report *

22:51.061 --> 22:54.465
* The man in the public school *

22:54.499 --> 22:57.301
* The man owns the golden rule *

22:57.334 --> 23:00.405
* Yeah, I'm everybody's slave *

23:00.438 --> 23:02.540
* I made you my slave *

23:02.573 --> 23:06.143
* My slave, my slave,
my slave, my slave... *

23:06.176 --> 23:09.547
* You said this I do for you *

23:13.117 --> 23:14.819
* If it would help *

23:14.852 --> 23:16.921
* To give the world back *

23:16.954 --> 23:18.589
* What it gave *

23:18.623 --> 23:22.427
* Then I would *

23:22.460 --> 23:24.128
* Oh, oh *

23:26.397 --> 23:28.399
* I would *

23:29.700 --> 23:32.069
* I would *

23:33.237 --> 23:38.208
* I would for you. *

23:46.484 --> 23:50.087
(insects chirping and trilling,
water gurgling)

23:59.096 --> 24:02.266
NARRATOR: And now we must speak
of Zhuang Zhou,

24:02.299 --> 24:06.704
who fell asleep one day
and dreamed he was a butterfly.

24:06.737 --> 24:09.707
For hours, he fluttered
in the warm winter sun,

24:09.740 --> 24:13.644
until he no longer remembered
he was Zhuang Zhou.

24:15.680 --> 24:19.316
Suddenly he awoke,
and he was Zhuang Zhou again.

24:19.349 --> 24:21.151
But in that moment,
he didn't know.

24:21.185 --> 24:25.055
Was he Zhuang Zhou who had
dreamt he was a butterfly,

24:25.089 --> 24:28.693
or a butterfly who was dreaming
he was Zhuang Zhou?

24:30.995 --> 24:35.265
A delusion starts
like any other idea, as an egg.

24:35.299 --> 24:39.169
Identical on the outside,
perfectly formed.

24:39.203 --> 24:43.107
From the shell, you'd never
know anything was wrong.

24:43.140 --> 24:47.845
It's what's inside
that matters.

24:58.022 --> 25:00.858
Albert A had an idea.

25:00.891 --> 25:04.094
One day, as he was walking,
he stumbled.

25:04.128 --> 25:05.863
And for a moment,

25:05.896 --> 25:09.399
it seemed that his right leg
didn't belong to him.

25:11.201 --> 25:13.203
This is how it begins.

25:17.207 --> 25:19.276
The leg was clearly Albert's.

25:19.309 --> 25:21.546
It was attached to his body,
and when he pricked it,

25:21.579 --> 25:23.681
he felt pain.

25:23.714 --> 25:27.051
But despite that,
the idea grew.

25:33.057 --> 25:35.726
Such is the power of an idea.

25:37.261 --> 25:38.729
With every day that passed,

25:38.763 --> 25:40.798
Albert became
more and more certain

25:40.831 --> 25:43.167
-that this was not his leg.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.803
He decided
he didn't want it anymore.

25:45.836 --> 25:49.840
And so one day, he went
to the hardware store.

25:52.743 --> 25:55.580
You see, an idea alone
isn't enough.

25:55.613 --> 25:57.982
We have ideas all the time,

25:58.015 --> 26:01.318
random thoughts and theories.

26:01.351 --> 26:04.021
-Most die...

26:04.054 --> 26:05.890
...before they can grow.

26:11.028 --> 26:13.564
For a delusion to thrive,

26:13.598 --> 26:17.167
other, more rational ideas
must be rejected,

26:17.201 --> 26:18.803
destroyed.

26:23.608 --> 26:26.877
Only then can
the delusion blossom...

26:32.650 --> 26:34.885
...into full-blown psychosis.

26:39.089 --> 26:46.263
(indistinct chatter in distance,
people marching)

26:46.296 --> 26:48.933
MAN:
David...

26:48.966 --> 26:51.301
PTONOMY: What's the last thing
you remember?

26:51.335 --> 26:55.072
-LENNY: Hey, sexy. -SYD:
What happened in the nightclub?

26:57.341 --> 26:59.476
PTONOMY: What's the last thing
you remember?

27:12.623 --> 27:14.258
WOMAN :
Reminder:

27:14.291 --> 27:17.161
a loss of meaning
is not normal.

27:17.194 --> 27:19.463
Beware of ideas
that are not your own.

27:19.496 --> 27:20.931
Settling in?

27:26.603 --> 27:29.006
You know what I realized?

27:29.039 --> 27:31.676
I have no idea
what he looks like.

27:31.709 --> 27:33.844
-Amahl Farouk.
-Right.

27:33.878 --> 27:37.281
He wears so many masks.

27:37.314 --> 27:39.083
There isn't much.

27:39.116 --> 27:41.318
Uh, some sketches, rumors,

27:41.351 --> 27:43.187
a few Egyptian poems.

27:43.220 --> 27:47.858
We think he came to be sometime
in the early 1800s in Morocco.

27:47.892 --> 27:50.695
He came to be?

27:50.728 --> 27:52.930
Well, he's a mutation, like you,
but you-you know

27:52.963 --> 27:55.165
how these things get blown
out of proportion.

27:55.199 --> 27:57.001
We're a superstitious animal,

27:57.034 --> 27:58.969
always turning the weather
into acts of God.

27:59.003 --> 28:01.005
Like, probably, the Devil
was just some guy named Lucifer

28:01.038 --> 28:02.639
who beat up kids
for their Lunchables,

28:02.673 --> 28:04.274
and then a few hundred
years later...

28:04.308 --> 28:06.276
Wait. He's really that old?

28:07.912 --> 28:09.880
WOMAN :
New symptom alert.

28:09.914 --> 28:11.882
A strong urge to confess.

28:11.916 --> 28:13.884
I've been, uh, giving you
some breathing room,

28:13.918 --> 28:15.485
but there's
an official conversation

28:15.519 --> 28:16.887
that we need to have.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.959
Official?

28:21.992 --> 28:23.894
I heard your story.

28:23.928 --> 28:26.831
You were gone for a year, but
it only felt like a few hours.

28:26.864 --> 28:31.035
So we're gonna run some tests
and carbon-date you,

28:31.068 --> 28:34.171
like you would a fossil,
see what your cells say.

28:38.375 --> 28:40.010
You think I'm lying?

28:42.713 --> 28:44.148
You like soap operas?

28:44.181 --> 28:46.350
My mother had leukemia
when I was a kid

28:46.383 --> 28:48.052
and she was in bed a lot.

28:48.085 --> 28:50.888
Kept me home from school,
so I could keep her company.

28:50.921 --> 28:53.357
It was a-a big king-size bed.

28:53.390 --> 28:56.593
We'd eat ice cream,
watch soap operas.

28:56.626 --> 28:59.163
Anyway, we had a drinking game,
except with ice cream--

28:59.196 --> 29:03.934
any time somebody had
an evil twin or amnesia,

29:03.968 --> 29:05.970
we would eat ice cream.

29:09.740 --> 29:12.076
I'm not lying.

29:12.109 --> 29:13.677
Hold on.

29:13.710 --> 29:16.213
(indistinct male voice
over P.A.)

29:23.788 --> 29:26.556
Sorry, what were you saying?

29:30.961 --> 29:33.063
You know I can read your mind.

29:39.303 --> 29:42.472
It was good to see you.

29:45.776 --> 29:49.780
I was kind of a fat kid
on account of all the ice cream.

29:49.814 --> 29:51.648
My mom was so nice, though.

29:51.681 --> 29:54.151
She used to call me "husky."

29:55.519 --> 29:57.721
Died when I was ten.

29:57.754 --> 30:02.492
I'm supposed to tell you
to go and see Admiral Fukyama.

30:02.526 --> 30:06.296
They're eager to talk to you.

30:07.531 --> 30:09.566
Wait... they?

30:09.599 --> 30:11.068
WOMAN :
New symptom alert.

30:11.101 --> 30:12.502
A sudden decrease...

30:16.841 --> 30:18.475
Hello.

30:19.676 --> 30:21.045
Hi.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.182
I'm David.

30:25.215 --> 30:27.852
: Weird.
-DAVID 2: Read his mind.

30:27.885 --> 30:30.154
-DAVID 2: Their mind, whatever.

30:30.187 --> 30:31.488
VERMILLION 1:
Our mind cannot be read.

30:31.521 --> 30:32.823
VERMILLION 3:
When we were a boy,

30:32.857 --> 30:34.358
we had the machine
put into our head.

30:34.391 --> 30:36.026
For days we screamed.

30:36.060 --> 30:37.427
The pain was in the volcano,

30:37.461 --> 30:39.429
puncturing the molten core.

30:39.463 --> 30:40.998
The device very deep
in our cerebral cortex,

30:41.031 --> 30:43.667
like nails from a bomb
in a public place.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.669
Hardware inside software.

30:45.702 --> 30:46.803
And now we are this.

30:46.837 --> 30:48.272
The machine that bleeds.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.340
The organizing principle.

30:54.711 --> 30:56.480
Okay, well...

31:00.550 --> 31:03.854
I've been someplace else,
and now I'm here.

31:05.522 --> 31:07.691
And we're gonna find him,
the Shadow King,

31:07.724 --> 31:09.793
and put a stop to all this.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.461
He is part of you.

31:11.495 --> 31:12.829
DAVID 1:
What do they know?

31:12.863 --> 31:14.631
DAVID 2:
Assume everything. Be honest.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.200
Well, we were together
a long time.

31:16.233 --> 31:18.969
I can still... sense him,

31:19.003 --> 31:22.706
still feel him, but...

31:22.739 --> 31:25.042
right now I think
he's-he's hiding from me,

31:25.075 --> 31:28.045
so if there's a way you could...

31:28.078 --> 31:29.846
boost my signal...

31:31.681 --> 31:33.083
We have anticipated this.

31:33.117 --> 31:35.352
Mr. Loudermilk has
developed a device...

31:35.385 --> 31:39.089
To help you recover your
memories and find Farouk.

31:39.123 --> 31:41.691
Cary. Good.
That's... good.

31:41.725 --> 31:45.529
So... when we find him,

31:45.562 --> 31:48.933
the... Shadow King,

31:48.966 --> 31:50.968
what are you gonna do?

31:52.970 --> 31:55.139
He will be terminated.

31:59.076 --> 32:01.845
Right, but he's in the body
of a friend of mine.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.347
The scientist, Oliver Bird.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.015
DAVID:
Yes, Oliver.

32:05.049 --> 32:08.385
A really... He's a good guy.
You'd like him,

32:08.418 --> 32:10.120
if that's...

32:10.154 --> 32:11.788
something you do.

32:11.821 --> 32:13.457
Either way, he's a hostage,

32:13.490 --> 32:16.060
and we are not gonna
kill the hostage.

32:16.093 --> 32:18.062
The body must also be destroyed.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.365
-The body of Amahl Farouk.

32:21.398 --> 32:22.967
His physical form.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.935
Many decades ago it was hidden.

32:24.969 --> 32:27.471
After his defeat
on the astral plane.

32:27.504 --> 32:30.607
By my father.

32:30.640 --> 32:33.043
Farouk's mind is strong,

32:33.077 --> 32:35.645
but the mutations are genetic,
meaning "of the genes."

32:35.679 --> 32:38.282
Physical, not mental.

32:38.315 --> 32:39.950
-On its own,

32:39.984 --> 32:41.585
the Shadow King's mind
is powerful.

32:41.618 --> 32:43.453
But were he to rejoin his body,
he would be...

32:43.487 --> 32:44.754
Unstoppable.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.661
So, where is it?

32:51.695 --> 32:52.929
This information is not

32:52.963 --> 32:54.764
available to us
at the present time.

32:54.798 --> 32:57.701
We are looking,
as is the Shadow King.

32:59.836 --> 33:02.506
So, you're saying it's a race.

33:02.539 --> 33:04.374
We're in a race.

33:12.282 --> 33:15.152
The male Loudermilk
is waiting in his lab.

33:15.185 --> 33:16.886
Do not fail.

33:42.679 --> 33:45.049
How do you feel
about small spaces?

33:45.082 --> 33:47.151
I'm against them.

33:47.184 --> 33:49.486
And when I say the words
pitch black...

33:49.519 --> 33:51.321
What exactly are you
gonna do to me?

33:51.355 --> 33:53.390
In order to boost
your psychic abilities,

33:53.423 --> 33:57.861
I've created an
amplification chamber.

34:00.064 --> 34:01.665
DAVID:
No.

34:01.698 --> 34:04.168
The fluid is 80% glucose,

34:04.201 --> 34:06.303
15% bicarbonate,

34:06.336 --> 34:08.672
and it's 5% strawberry extract.

34:08.705 --> 34:10.740
-Why...
-It's for conductivity.

34:10.774 --> 34:12.642
Also to give it a pleasant
aroma and taste,

34:12.676 --> 34:16.813
in case you should swallow any,
which, do not swallow any.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.348
So, I'm supposed to find
the Shadow King

34:18.382 --> 34:20.217
from inside a daiquiri?

34:20.250 --> 34:23.553
While you're in the tank,
I'll be using the resonator

34:23.587 --> 34:25.089
to bring up specific
frequencies.

34:25.122 --> 34:27.424
We can communicate,
so if you see something,

34:27.457 --> 34:29.226
or if you want me to try
a different frequency,

34:29.259 --> 34:30.994
you just let me know.

34:31.027 --> 34:33.197
Okay.

34:33.230 --> 34:34.564
What?

34:34.598 --> 34:37.201
Clothes off, handsome.

34:37.234 --> 34:39.403
Yes. In order for
the connectivity

34:39.436 --> 34:41.238
to be at maximum efficiency,
we do need

34:41.271 --> 34:42.672
full exothermal contact.

34:42.706 --> 34:45.275
So, get naked.

34:45.309 --> 34:47.411
Very funny.

34:50.214 --> 34:51.681
-We've talked about this.

34:51.715 --> 34:53.217
You make people uncomfortable.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.051
Uncom-- I make people
uncomfortable?

34:55.085 --> 34:56.720
You spent Wednesday walking
around without pants on.

34:56.753 --> 34:58.122
How do I make people
uncomfortable?

34:58.155 --> 34:59.723
All right, in.
That's-- in, in!

34:59.756 --> 35:01.725
No, I don't-- I don't
understand how...

35:05.229 --> 35:07.964
I'm so sorry about that.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.045
We're right outside.

35:22.078 --> 35:24.981
This is a bad idea.

35:25.014 --> 35:27.817
Ju-Just open your mind.

35:29.519 --> 35:32.021
Open my mind. Right.

35:39.163 --> 35:40.930
Opening mind.

35:45.835 --> 35:48.605
Ping me if he finds something.
Cary?

35:50.307 --> 35:51.941
Yeah.

35:54.444 --> 35:57.314
CARY:
Okay, here we go.

35:59.683 --> 36:01.084
:
All right, David,

36:01.117 --> 36:02.919
let's take this for a spin.

36:09.526 --> 36:11.328
DAVID :
You've used this before, right?

36:11.361 --> 36:13.863
CARY: Yes, but only
in a theoretical sense.

36:13.897 --> 36:15.332
DAVID:
What does that mean?

36:26.843 --> 36:28.845
You believe him?

36:30.980 --> 36:32.916
Which part?

36:35.385 --> 36:37.654
It's David.

36:37.687 --> 36:40.023
That much I know.

36:40.056 --> 36:42.659
And I saw memories.

36:42.692 --> 36:45.995
He says he doesn't remember,
but I saw memories.

36:46.029 --> 36:48.565
SYD:
A year of memories?

36:51.568 --> 36:54.338
A few images.

36:54.371 --> 36:57.006
He was in the nightclub.

36:58.242 --> 37:00.410
I know.
You found him there.

37:00.444 --> 37:02.312
He was there
when Oliver was there.

37:02.346 --> 37:05.014
They were there together.

37:05.048 --> 37:07.016
SYD:
Doing what?

37:09.253 --> 37:11.421
Dancing.

37:13.390 --> 37:14.858
So, you think...

37:14.891 --> 37:17.794
Maybe the Shadow King
still has ahold of him.

37:28.372 --> 37:30.474
No.

37:36.446 --> 37:38.582
You still trust him?

37:41.885 --> 37:43.787
He's my man.

37:53.330 --> 37:56.500
CARY :
Orange 50, orange 20, red.

37:59.969 --> 38:00.937
Red 15.

38:00.970 --> 38:02.606
-Ah.

38:05.074 --> 38:07.977
Oh, sorry.
Okay, I'll-I'll dial it in.

38:09.613 --> 38:10.547
DAVID:
Slightly.

38:10.580 --> 38:11.948
I can work with slightly.

38:11.981 --> 38:14.751
Remember, keep an

38:14.784 --> 38:15.652
open mind.

38:21.291 --> 38:23.593
-DAVID: Cary...

38:23.627 --> 38:26.129
DAVID :
Cary...

38:43.713 --> 38:45.315
GIRL:
Duck, duck,

38:45.349 --> 38:48.518
-duck, duck, duck, duck,

38:48.552 --> 38:51.187
-goose.

38:51.220 --> 38:53.289
(alarm blaring,
children laughing)

38:53.323 --> 38:55.325
(children's laughter
echoing, fading)

39:00.864 --> 39:02.366
PTONOMY: What's the last thing
you remember?

39:02.399 --> 39:04.801
CLARK :
What are you hiding?

39:06.870 --> 39:08.872
*

39:16.179 --> 39:18.214
PTONOMY: What's the last thing
you remember?

39:18.247 --> 39:19.849
DAVID:
Farouk escaped.

39:19.883 --> 39:21.885
Syd and I were
on the balcony,

39:21.918 --> 39:23.953
and I could sense him
heading south.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.355
SYD:
What happened in the nightclub?

39:25.389 --> 39:27.156
DAVID:
And then there was an...

39:27.190 --> 39:29.158
-DAVID: ...an orb, and...

39:29.192 --> 39:31.961
it zapped me with,
like, a... a ray.

39:31.995 --> 39:34.030
*

39:47.611 --> 39:49.679
CLARK :
What are you hiding?

40:17.641 --> 40:19.643
*

40:39.929 --> 40:42.231
*

41:10.760 --> 41:13.697
*

41:31.380 --> 41:33.382
*

41:53.970 --> 41:56.005
*

42:24.868 --> 42:28.071
*

42:50.293 --> 42:52.261
*

43:13.382 --> 43:15.218
MAN :
New symptom alert.

43:15.251 --> 43:18.622
A strong urge to confess.

43:18.655 --> 43:20.724
New symptom alert.

43:20.757 --> 43:23.960
A strong urge to confess.

43:47.516 --> 43:50.453
David?

43:52.856 --> 43:55.291
I think I need to lie down.

43:59.162 --> 44:01.097
Oof.

44:01.130 --> 44:03.166
(indistinct radio chatter,
bird singing)

44:23.887 --> 44:25.421
I'll clear it off.

44:25.454 --> 44:27.256
No, that's...

44:27.290 --> 44:29.458
There's clothes for you
in the lockers.

44:44.307 --> 44:47.677
So, any luck finding Farouk?

44:53.516 --> 44:56.119
No, I...

44:56.152 --> 44:57.821
I couldn't see him.

45:00.857 --> 45:02.458
What's it like in there?

45:02.491 --> 45:05.494
What did you see?

45:09.332 --> 45:10.800
Eh, nothing, really,

45:10.834 --> 45:14.303
just... just a lot
of random things.

45:14.337 --> 45:16.372
Just... noise.

45:25.214 --> 45:28.718
You're keeping secrets.

45:28.752 --> 45:30.754
What?

45:35.124 --> 45:38.561
I know you.

45:38.594 --> 45:40.663
I used to.

45:40.696 --> 45:42.665
There's things
you're not saying.

45:42.698 --> 45:44.333
Syd, it's...

45:45.769 --> 45:47.436
I-I know it's...

45:47.470 --> 45:49.038
I know it's hard.

45:49.072 --> 45:52.675
You know, so much time
has passed for you, and...

45:52.708 --> 45:55.278
for me, I just saw you,
yesterday,

45:55.311 --> 45:57.280
so try to remember:
I'm the same.

45:57.313 --> 45:59.382
You're the one who's...

46:01.951 --> 46:04.220
You know, maybe you're right.
This is...

46:04.253 --> 46:07.090
I...

46:07.123 --> 46:08.925
This... this is all...

46:08.958 --> 46:10.960
this...

46:13.897 --> 46:17.767
This is a lot to process.

46:19.903 --> 46:22.138
It's the second time.

46:22.171 --> 46:24.140
-That you left.

46:24.173 --> 46:28.477
There was Amy, the rescue.
Remember?

46:28.511 --> 46:30.780
-Oh...

46:30.814 --> 46:33.082
You promised me you wouldn't,
and then you did.

46:33.116 --> 46:34.617
That was...

46:34.650 --> 46:37.220
Lenny, Farouk...
I...

46:37.253 --> 46:39.222
I wasn't in control.

46:39.255 --> 46:40.456
-They...
-So I'm...

46:40.489 --> 46:42.591
just wondering

46:42.625 --> 46:47.196
how long till you leave...
again?

46:55.138 --> 46:57.406
Close your eyes.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.843
Come on.

47:08.051 --> 47:11.587
Okay, now, look.

47:11.620 --> 47:13.656
*

47:19.162 --> 47:20.930
-I had Cary make it,

47:20.964 --> 47:23.666
when I was in the tank.

47:25.501 --> 47:27.203
It's beautiful.

47:28.304 --> 47:31.174
It's no ordinary compass.

47:31.207 --> 47:33.209
Watch.

47:37.413 --> 47:39.348
-Just head in the direction

47:39.382 --> 47:42.218
it is pointing,
and I'll be there.

47:42.251 --> 47:43.519
Hmm.

47:43.552 --> 47:47.556
If we get lost,
we get lost together.

47:52.929 --> 47:55.031
You promise:

47:55.064 --> 47:58.001
no secrets.

48:00.169 --> 48:02.571
No secrets.

48:39.475 --> 48:42.711
PTONOMY: What's the last thing
you remember?

48:42.745 --> 48:45.848
Before the club?

48:45.881 --> 48:48.184
What's the last thing
you remember?

48:48.217 --> 48:50.186
No!

48:50.219 --> 48:52.021
DAVID:
Let me out!

48:52.055 --> 48:54.023
Help me!

48:54.057 --> 48:56.926
Let me out!

48:56.960 --> 48:59.128
Help me!

48:59.162 --> 49:00.463
Syd!

50:14.803 --> 50:17.340
Syd.

50:18.641 --> 50:20.643
Where...

50:22.711 --> 50:24.813
Where are you?

50:29.652 --> 50:32.455
No sound. Great.

50:32.488 --> 50:34.490
That's perfect.

50:44.600 --> 50:48.471
Whoa.

50:48.504 --> 50:50.506
What is that, an eight?

51:00.916 --> 51:02.885
Oh, it's the hour-hourglass.

51:02.918 --> 51:04.253
It's "time."

51:04.287 --> 51:05.588
Time is running out.

51:05.621 --> 51:06.955
Time's running out.

51:12.361 --> 51:14.063
Me?

51:19.735 --> 51:21.104
:
Gift?

51:21.137 --> 51:24.873
Gift. You have a gift for me.

51:25.908 --> 51:28.477
No.

51:31.247 --> 51:33.082
Present.

51:33.116 --> 51:34.350
Me.

51:34.383 --> 51:37.220
I'm in the present.

51:37.253 --> 51:39.122
I'm good at this.

51:41.724 --> 51:44.893
Me... arrow...

51:44.927 --> 51:46.162
you.

51:49.465 --> 51:51.200
Clock.

51:51.234 --> 51:53.936
Time.

51:53.969 --> 51:56.071
Arrow.

51:56.105 --> 51:58.274
Arrow of time.

52:00.943 --> 52:02.545
Arrow of time.

52:02.578 --> 52:05.614
I'm in the present,
so you're in the future.

52:05.648 --> 52:07.950
You're in the future.

52:07.983 --> 52:09.952
Wait...

52:09.985 --> 52:11.654
You're in the future?

52:23.299 --> 52:24.667
Crown. King.

52:24.700 --> 52:27.002
Shadow King.

52:27.035 --> 52:29.438
Farouk.

52:34.143 --> 52:35.478
Body.

52:35.511 --> 52:37.546
He's-he's trying
to find his body.

53:01.904 --> 53:04.006
"Him"?

53:13.182 --> 53:15.184
Help Farouk find his body?

53:15.218 --> 53:17.220
Why would I do that?

53:20.523 --> 53:24.227
Wait, this is you?

53:24.260 --> 53:26.562
The orb

53:37.039 --> 53:38.541
Syd.

53:38.574 --> 53:40.709
Is somebody there, Syd?

53:47.283 --> 53:50.853
Talk to me, Syd.

53:50.886 --> 53:54.557
Syd. Syd.

54:05.301 --> 54:07.303
*

54:26.322 --> 54:28.491
Syd.

54:42.438 --> 54:46.141
* One pill makes you *

54:46.174 --> 54:49.778
* Larger *

54:49.812 --> 54:52.781
* And one pill makes you *

54:52.815 --> 54:55.183
* Small *

54:59.288 --> 55:04.960
* And the ones that *

55:04.993 --> 55:07.296
* Mama gave you *

55:09.365 --> 55:12.134
* Don't do *

55:12.167 --> 55:15.671
* Anything at *

55:35.791 --> 55:39.762
* Tall *

55:39.795 --> 55:44.633
* She's ten feet *

55:44.667 --> 55:46.268
* Tall *

55:46.301 --> 55:48.637
Hey, sexy.

55:48.671 --> 55:52.207
* Ten *

55:52.240 --> 55:54.343
* Feet *

55:59.147 --> 56:02.385

MAN:
Now I get it.
