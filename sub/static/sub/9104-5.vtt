00:11.200 --> 00:13.160

&lrm;[Tikki] Invite him to a movie, then.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.040
&lrm;[Marinette] Right, Tikki.

00:33.160 --> 00:34.360
&lrm;Imagine that.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.320
&lrm;Hey, Adrien. Would you like to...

00:36.480 --> 00:37.720
&lrm;[spluttering]

00:37.840 --> 00:39.280
&lrm;Exactly. I can't help it.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.640
&lrm;Every time I see him,

00:40.760 --> 00:43.280
&lrm;I get all clammy and I feel like fainting.

00:43.440 --> 00:48.200
&lrm;So you have to be blindfolded
&lrm;to have a normal conversation with him?

00:48.360 --> 00:49.360
&lrm;Pretty much.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.120
&lrm;There is a simple solution.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.760
&lrm;It's called a phone.
&lrm;You just need his number.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.920
&lrm;I know who'll have it.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.520
&lrm;I'm sure you've outdone yourself, Theo.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.480
&lrm;It was my honor.
&lrm;I can't wait to meet Ladybug.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.480
&lrm;I hope she signs my photo.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.680
&lrm;I used it as the inspiration
&lrm;for the statue.

01:09.840 --> 01:10.920
&lrm;It's nearly time.

01:11.120 --> 01:14.040
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;should already be here by now.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.120
&lrm;We know improv's not your bag,

01:16.240 --> 01:17.920
&lrm;so stick to this script.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.520
&lrm;The teachers say
&lrm;I don't sound natural when I read

01:20.680 --> 01:22.800
&lrm;Then memorize it. It's pretty simple.

01:22.960 --> 01:25.200
&lrm;You can do it.
&lrm;Just don't improvise, got it?

01:28.920 --> 01:31.000
&lrm;Forget it. It's never gonna work.

01:31.160 --> 01:32.200
&lrm;Too late.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.320
&lrm;It's dialing.

01:34.040 --> 01:36.080
&lrm;[Ayla giggles]

01:37.440 --> 01:39.920
<i>&lrm;Hey, this is Adrien's voicemail,</i>
<i>&lrm;leave a message.</i>

01:40.080 --> 01:41.440
&lrm;It's gone to voicemail.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.080
&lrm;Leave a message. Don't improv'.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.440
&lrm;Hello, Adrien's voicemail...

01:48.600 --> 01:51.160
&lrm;This is Marinette... who...
&lrm;has a message...

01:51.320 --> 01:54.560
&lrm;for you, of course,
&lrm;because it's your phone, so...

01:54.680 --> 01:57.160
&lrm;[she giggles]
&lrm;Call me, see you later, bye.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.560
&lrm;What did you expect?
&lrm;"Hey, hot stuff. It's Marinette.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.200
&lrm;"I'd ask you out

02:06.360 --> 02:10.440
&lrm;"but I've got such a crush on you
&lrm;that the only way to talk to you

02:10.600 --> 02:12.320
&lrm;"is over this stupid phone."

02:12.480 --> 02:14.040
&lrm;Pretty ridiculous, right?

<i>&lrm;To erase your message, press 2.</i>

<i>&lrm;Message saved. Goodbye.</i>

02:25.360 --> 02:26.960
&lrm;[she sobs]

02:27.120 --> 02:28.440
&lrm;It's not as bad as you think.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.400
&lrm;Ok, it's bad,

02:30.560 --> 02:33.480
&lrm;but you had to tell him one day,
&lrm;some way or another.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.760
&lrm;Think of it this way, no more secrets.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.840
&lrm;The voicemail recorded
&lrm;my whole conversation.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.360
&lrm;-Big deal.
&lrm;-I called him hot stuff.

02:41.480 --> 02:45.800
&lrm;He can't hear that message, Alya.
&lrm;If he does, I'll die of shame.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.400
&lrm;OK, I've an idea.

02:47.560 --> 02:50.760
&lrm;If his phone went to voicemail,
&lrm;it means he's busy.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.720
&lrm;That means you can get to it
&lrm;before he does.

02:53.880 --> 02:55.840
&lrm;I wonder where he'd be?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.880
&lrm;Of course. He's got fencing after school.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.920
&lrm;That's why he didn't pick up.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.840
&lrm;It ends in 22.5 minutes.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
&lrm;You're insane.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.360
&lrm;You know that, right?

03:14.080 --> 03:16.520
<i>&lrm;You have one new message.</i>

03:21.480 --> 03:23.600
&lrm;I gotta get a drink. Be right back.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.240
&lrm;Plagg!

03:29.360 --> 03:30.240
&lrm;You pig!

03:30.400 --> 03:32.320
&lrm;[he burps]
&lrm;You have one new message.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.440
&lrm;Move please,
&lrm;so I can check my voicemail.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.880
&lrm;I don't recognize this number.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.560
&lrm;Oh no, we're late!

03:38.840 --> 03:40.280
&lrm;Time to transform, Plagg.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.560
&lrm;[excited yelling]

03:45.680 --> 03:47.880
&lrm;Yeah!

03:49.040 --> 03:50.560
&lrm;Hey, everybody.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.600
&lrm;They're unveiling Ladybug
&lrm;and Cat Noir sculptures today.

03:53.760 --> 03:54.800
&lrm;I totally spaced.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.920
&lrm;Me too.

03:56.040 --> 03:58.560
&lrm;You never mentioned
&lrm;going to the unveiling.

03:58.720 --> 04:02.160
&lrm;I'm not, I mean I am...
&lrm;I mean, I forgot?

04:03.360 --> 04:06.520
&lrm;Listen, about Adrien's cell phone...
&lrm;What if we go after?

04:06.880 --> 04:09.880
&lrm;After the ceremony,
&lrm;his fencing training will be over,

04:10.040 --> 04:11.640
&lrm;and he'll have his phone back by then.

04:11.760 --> 04:14.680
&lrm;Shoot. I gotta cover this event
&lrm;for the Ladyblog.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.519
&lrm;I'm sorry, Marinette.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.600
&lrm;Don't sweat it. I can manage...

04:18.760 --> 04:19.880
&lrm;I think.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.839
&lrm;-You sure?
&lrm;-Yes, yes, I'm sure.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.040
&lrm;Cool, good luck.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.560
&lrm;Stay out of trouble.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.480
&lrm;And don't improv'.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.360
&lrm;[car horn]

04:28.760 --> 04:31.720
&lrm;Isn't Ladybug supposed to be
&lrm;at the unveiling?

04:31.880 --> 04:34.360
&lrm;Yes, but Marinette needs to be
&lrm;at the school first.

04:34.520 --> 04:36.480
&lrm;But it is a ceremony in your honor.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.720
&lrm;And it's my honor that's at stake.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.040
&lrm;I'll be in and out in 5 minutes.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.640
&lrm;We can be at the ceremony in no time.

04:45.840 --> 04:48.240
&lrm;Excuse me Cat Noir,
&lrm;but Ladybug's not here.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.320
&lrm;Don't worry. She'll be here soon.

04:50.480 --> 04:53.800
&lrm;I can handle it for now.
&lrm;I'm the one in charge anyway.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.560
&lrm;I wanted to ask her to sign this photo.

04:56.720 --> 04:57.760
&lrm;She's amazing.

04:57.880 --> 04:58.880
&lrm;She's so brave...

04:59.040 --> 04:59.880
&lrm;And smart...

05:00.000 --> 05:01.360
&lrm;The way she saves everyone.

05:01.560 --> 05:04.640
&lrm;Perhaps we should commence.
&lrm;It might bring her here faster.

05:05.160 --> 05:09.440
&lrm;Just a minute more, Mayor Bourgeois.
&lrm;She is going to come. I can feel it.

05:15.840 --> 05:16.680
&lrm;In there.

05:16.840 --> 05:18.120
&lrm;[Tikki] Oh boy.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.640
&lrm;Which one's his?

05:20.080 --> 05:21.880
&lrm;Call him. His phone will ring.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.120
&lrm;Nice, Tikki.

05:24.960 --> 05:29.360
&lrm;[phone rings]

05:29.680 --> 05:33.520
&lrm;It's only proper for Paris
&lrm;to pay homage to those who protect us.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.960
&lrm;[Mayor] Ladybug and Cat Noir.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.880
&lrm;Can I get some photos?

05:41.760 --> 05:43.760
&lrm;[Tikki] Hurry, they're finishing up.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.600
&lrm;[phone rings]

05:45.760 --> 05:46.920
&lrm;Here it is.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.880
&lrm;It's locked!

05:50.280 --> 05:51.520
&lrm;Ta-da!

05:55.480 --> 05:56.920
&lrm;These statues are amazing

05:57.080 --> 05:59.880
&lrm;but one thing's off.
&lrm;I'm actually taller than her.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.200
&lrm;Ladybug didn't show. I just wanted to...

06:02.320 --> 06:04.440
&lrm;express my adoration for her.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.080
&lrm;Let her know that everything I had
&lrm;went into her statue..

06:07.200 --> 06:09.440
&lrm;If she took time to get to know me,

06:09.600 --> 06:11.080
&lrm;she'd see how much we have in common,

06:11.200 --> 06:13.000
&lrm;our devotion to the things we love.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.520
&lrm;Hey, don't mean to burst your bubble,

06:15.680 --> 06:18.680
&lrm;but you know, Ladybug and I,
&lrm;we're a thing, you know.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.960
&lrm;-Really?
&lrm;-Yeah, we're like this.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.360
&lrm;What does Ladybug see in him?

06:31.360 --> 06:33.440
&lrm;[phone bleeps]

06:34.000 --> 06:36.080
&lrm;They're coming. Forget it.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.840
&lrm;I haven't erased it yet.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
&lrm;We're out of time.
&lrm;We have to get to the ceremony.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.080
&lrm;That was rough.

06:57.040 --> 07:01.040
&lrm;[Cat Noir whistles]

07:04.560 --> 07:05.680
&lrm;"A thing"?

07:05.800 --> 07:08.600
&lrm;You don't even take love seriously
&lrm;calling it "a thing".

07:08.960 --> 07:10.400
&lrm;You don't deserve her.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.560
&lrm;I do!

07:16.600 --> 07:18.600
&lrm;[evil voice] Disappointed by Ladybug

07:18.760 --> 07:20.240
&lrm;and jealous of Cat Noir,

07:20.400 --> 07:23.280
&lrm;the perfect formula for disaster.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.320
&lrm;Fly away, my little Akuma,

07:31.440 --> 07:33.600
&lrm;and evilize him.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.560
&lrm;Hello, Copycat,

07:42.720 --> 07:44.520
&lrm;I'm Hawk Moth.

07:44.680 --> 07:47.880
&lrm;Once you get rid of Cat Noir,
&lrm;you can take his place,

07:48.040 --> 07:50.640
&lrm;and Ladybug will be yours forever.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.920
&lrm;The very thought of it makes me purr.

07:58.560 --> 08:00.040
&lrm;Where is it?

08:00.200 --> 08:03.920
&lrm;What are you looking at me for?
&lrm;I didn't eat it, I swear.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.520
&lrm;How do you listen to messages...?

08:08.680 --> 08:10.080
&lrm;[phone rings]

08:10.200 --> 08:12.480
&lrm;Adrien's looking for his phone.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.080
&lrm;What if he tracks it?

08:14.240 --> 08:17.400
&lrm;He'll figure out I stole it
&lrm;and I'll spend my life in jail

08:17.560 --> 08:20.400
&lrm;and I'll never get to go
&lrm;to the movies with Adrien.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.360
&lrm;You need to get your priorities in order.

08:25.520 --> 08:26.640
&lrm;I know.

08:26.800 --> 08:29.800
&lrm;Some days it feels impossible
&lrm;to balance being Marinette

08:29.960 --> 08:31.520
&lrm;and being Ladybug.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.600
<i>&lrm;Hey, this is Adrien's voicemail,</i>
<i>&lrm;leave a message.</i>

&lrm;[groaning]

08:57.360 --> 08:59.080
&lrm;I gotta get this on camera.

09:00.520 --> 09:04.360
<i>&lrm;And in some astonishing news,</i>
<i>&lrm;there's been a theft at the Louvre.</i>

09:04.520 --> 09:05.840
<i>&lrm;Amateur videos show</i>

09:06.000 --> 09:09.280
<i>&lrm;that the thief is none other</i>
<i>&lrm;than the famous hero, Cat Noir.</i>

09:09.720 --> 09:12.120
<i>&lrm;This painting is the cat's meow.</i>

09:15.240 --> 09:16.960
&lrm;The "cat's meow"?

09:19.640 --> 09:22.240
&lrm;Not only is he a fake,
&lrm;he's a terrible fake.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.800
<i>&lrm;Thanks JD. Now for your weather.</i>

09:33.000 --> 09:36.840
&lrm;Of course Adrien owns
&lrm;a super-expensive hi-tech smartphone.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.320
&lrm;I can't even figure out how it works.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.680
&lrm;It would help
&lrm;if you took off those silly mittens.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.200
&lrm;And risk leaving finger prints? No way.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.960

&lrm;Almost. I haven't erased the message
&lrm;yet but I'm working on it now.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.280
<i>&lrm;No way. You palmed his phone?</i>

09:54.560 --> 09:55.920
&lrm;Yes... No...

09:56.080 --> 09:58.400
&lrm;I mean...
&lrm;I was planning to give it back.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.680
&lrm;Where are you? I could use some help.

&lrm;What? Somebody robbed Cat Noir?

10:07.560 --> 10:09.080
&lrm;No, girl. Didn't you hear?

10:09.240 --> 10:11.560
&lrm;Cat Noir came in and stole the Mona Lisa,

10:11.760 --> 10:12.960
<i>&lrm;in broad daylight.</i>

10:13.120 --> 10:15.800
<i>&lrm;Ladybug's gonna turn up,</i>
<i>&lrm;and I don't wanna miss it.</i>

10:15.960 --> 10:17.120
<i>&lrm;Chill. I'll be over later.</i>

10:17.440 --> 10:18.560
&lrm;OK.

10:18.880 --> 10:21.640
&lrm;Cat Noir is a lot of things,
&lrm;but he's no thief.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.560
&lrm;Time to transform.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.760
&lrm;Tikki, Spots on!

10:48.240 --> 10:51.400
&lrm;Easy, tigers, you've got the wrong cat.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.640
&lrm;That thief's an impostor.
&lrm;I'm the real Cat Noir.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.520
&lrm;Let me check it out.

10:57.640 --> 11:01.000
&lrm;I have a knack for finding clues,
&lrm;you know, animal instincts.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.680
&lrm;Of course. Come with me.
&lrm;Thanks for your help.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.880
&lrm;Hey. I'm the real Cat Noir.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.040
&lrm;I'm way slicker than that guy.

11:19.480 --> 11:23.040
&lrm;Kitty's in the slammer,
&lrm;I repeat, kitty's in the slammer.

11:32.560 --> 11:36.400
&lrm;Mr. Mayor, this is ridiculous.
&lrm;I'm sure there's a simple explanation.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.080
&lrm;Kitty's in the slammer, Ladybug.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.360
&lrm;Don't think you're gonna...

11:39.520 --> 11:41.560
&lrm;Now, now, leave it to the experts.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.880
&lrm;We've got it under control.

11:55.560 --> 11:58.000
&lrm;Thanks for the hospitality
&lrm;but I gotta split.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.240
&lrm;So, I'll say this one more time.
&lrm;You've got the wrong cat!

12:04.880 --> 12:05.960
<i>&lrm;Cat Noir's getting away.</i>

12:12.840 --> 12:15.280
&lrm;If he's so innocent,
&lrm;why is he running away?

12:15.440 --> 12:18.080
&lrm;If you were wrongly imprisoned,
&lrm;wouldn't you?

12:18.200 --> 12:20.880
&lrm;[police sirens]

12:28.320 --> 12:32.560
&lrm;Requesting assistance.
&lrm;We're in pursuit of the suspect.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.320
&lrm;Cat Noir, what's going on?

12:36.480 --> 12:38.040
<i>&lrm;You know I'm innocent, don't you, Bugaboo?</i>

12:38.640 --> 12:41.280
&lrm;Stop calling me Bugaboo. This is serious.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.480
&lrm;I'm gonna find the culprit
&lrm;and save my tail.

12:43.640 --> 12:44.840
&lrm;I'll get back to...

12:51.160 --> 12:52.200
&lrm;[police sirens]

12:52.360 --> 12:54.280
<i>&lrm;Give yourself up, Cat Noir!</i>

12:55.120 --> 12:56.840
&lrm;Aren't you gonna go after him?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.760
&lrm;I'll leave it to the experts.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.320
&lrm;Come on, let's get him.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.920
&lrm;[adrien whistles]

13:12.040 --> 13:15.240
&lrm;If you want my opinion,
&lrm;I'd say the thief was akumatized.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.560
&lrm;That I figured.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.480
&lrm;See that lollypop stick?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.240
&lrm;The sculptor.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.880
&lrm;How did I not see that jealousy coming?

13:23.000 --> 13:24.400
&lrm;Yours or his?

13:24.520 --> 13:26.480
&lrm;[sarcastic laugh] So funny.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.400
&lrm;Gotcha, Copycat.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.560
&lrm;[bleeping]

13:43.640 --> 13:45.160
&lrm;Cat Noir, where are you?

13:45.280 --> 13:46.320
&lrm;I've found his den.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.760
&lrm;-<i>&lrm;Who?</i>
&lrm;-My copycat.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.760
&lrm;I'm not getting you.

13:50.880 --> 13:53.320
&lrm;If you'd been there this morning,
&lrm;you'd know.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.600
&lrm;Well, tell me where you are.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.840
&lrm;No. This is between me and him.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.520
&lrm;I got myself into this mess,
&lrm;so I'm gonna get myself out of it.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.480
&lrm;Cat? Cat!

14:04.120 --> 14:05.920
&lrm;[bleeping]

14:11.400 --> 14:12.760
&lrm;"Cat's in the bag!"?

14:17.960 --> 14:19.720
&lrm;Cataclysm!

14:23.840 --> 14:26.160
&lrm;I don't get what Ladybug sees in you,

14:26.320 --> 14:29.200
&lrm;a fool who so easily falls into my trap.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.360
&lrm;Looking for this?

14:32.520 --> 14:35.720
&lrm;Which one shall I pick up?
&lrm;My one or my one.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.200
&lrm;[bleeping]

14:37.360 --> 14:40.840
&lrm;Ladybug, hurry, I've caught
&lrm;the imposter at Theo's workshop.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.600
&lrm;I'll be there in 30 seconds.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.720
&lrm;Don't come here, Ladybug, it's a trap!

14:46.200 --> 14:50.600
&lrm;Too late, Cat, Ladybug's on her way,
&lrm;which was my plan all along.

14:50.720 --> 14:53.000
&lrm;She won't be duped. She knows me too well.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.440
&lrm;I know you well, too. And, from now on,

14:55.560 --> 14:57.040
&lrm;she'll love me, not you!

14:57.680 --> 14:59.120
&lrm;Love me?

14:59.280 --> 15:00.880
&lrm;You're right. She loves me.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.920
&lrm;That's why she'll be able
&lrm;to reveal your true identity.

15:04.040 --> 15:07.640
&lrm;Copycat, stop the small talk
&lrm;and get me Cat Noir's Miraculous!

15:13.800 --> 15:15.280
&lrm;[he groans]

15:16.680 --> 15:17.760
&lrm;[whizzing]

15:22.240 --> 15:23.240
&lrm;There you are.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.600
&lrm;[Ladybug]
&lrm;Cat Noir, he really looks like you.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.280
&lrm;That's because I am me.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.920
&lrm;-Where's his Akuma?
&lrm;-Inside his ring of course.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.320
&lrm;Grab it.

15:40.280 --> 15:44.040
&lrm;Ladybug's doing all the work for us,
&lrm;what sweet irony.

15:44.480 --> 15:45.600
&lrm;[bleeping]

15:45.800 --> 15:48.080
&lrm;He even has the same powers as you.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.880
&lrm;Simply amazing, isn't it?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.480
&lrm;If you don't believe I'm Cat Noir,

15:51.640 --> 15:53.720
&lrm;ask him about our love for each other.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.800
&lrm;Have I ever lied to you, Bugagoo?

15:59.840 --> 16:02.240
&lrm;I hope you didn't tell him about us.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.520
&lrm;What?

16:03.680 --> 16:05.840
&lrm;That we're... you know...

16:06.000 --> 16:08.200
&lrm;We made a secret promise.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.840
&lrm;Yes... Of course.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.480
&lrm;We never made a promise,

16:12.880 --> 16:13.880
&lrm;Copycat!

16:15.120 --> 16:16.240
&lrm;I love you, Ladybug.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.920
&lrm;I'm way better than this mangy alley cat!

16:19.240 --> 16:20.720
&lrm;Sorry, liars are losers.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.120
&lrm;Cat Noir may annoy me,
&lrm;but he's never lied to me.

16:23.240 --> 16:25.760
&lrm;Thanks for the compliment... I think.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.800
&lrm;Do it now, take his Miraculous!

16:32.400 --> 16:34.800
&lrm;If I can't have you... then nobody will.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.480
&lrm;Cataclysm!

16:37.520 --> 16:38.640
&lrm;Let's wrap this up.

16:39.480 --> 16:41.000
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

16:46.080 --> 16:49.160
&lrm;A spoon?
&lrm;What am I supposed to do with this?

17:04.839 --> 17:06.119
&lrm;Excellent job, Milady.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.599
&lrm;Where's his Akuma?

17:07.920 --> 17:10.440
&lrm;Photo in his pocket. Let's make it snappy.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.440
&lrm;[cackling] You're going

17:12.560 --> 17:14.200
&lrm;to change back before me.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.640
&lrm;He's pretty good.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.240
&lrm;Don't rub it in.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.480
&lrm;I told you I was better than him.

17:42.680 --> 17:44.840
&lrm;But I'm better than both of you.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.920
&lrm;-Hey, it's me.
&lrm;-He's lying. I'm the real one.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.440
&lrm;Now you're both annoying me.

18:10.600 --> 18:13.160
&lrm;Show me your ring.
&lrm;How many pads do you have left?

18:14.120 --> 18:15.560
&lrm;[bleeping]

18:16.160 --> 18:17.440
&lrm;[bleeping]

18:18.160 --> 18:19.680
&lrm;Cat Noir, scratch attack!

18:19.800 --> 18:22.200
&lrm;Gladly. I love a good cat fight.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.920
&lrm;Time to go Akuma fishing.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.320
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little Akuma.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.280
&lrm;Time to de-evilize!

19:11.520 --> 19:12.560
&lrm;Gotcha.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.720
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.880
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

19:27.120 --> 19:28.440
&lrm;Nice catch.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.440
&lrm;I'm glad you could tell
&lrm;the real Cat from the fake.

19:31.600 --> 19:34.200
&lrm;Once I figured out
&lrm;which cat really loved me,

19:34.360 --> 19:35.840
&lrm;it was a no-brainer.

19:38.320 --> 19:41.160
&lrm;Better help him out.
&lrm;His crush just got crushed.

19:43.120 --> 19:45.560
&lrm;That makes two of us.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.800
&lrm;What am I doing here?

19:48.960 --> 19:50.160
&lrm;Ladybug?

19:50.280 --> 19:52.640
&lrm;Sorry I couldn't make it
&lrm;this morning, Theo.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.600
&lrm;Can you sign it for me?

19:55.960 --> 19:57.160
&lrm;Of course I can.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.000
&lrm;You've got some real artistry here.

20:00.160 --> 20:01.360
&lrm;You really captured my essence.

20:01.800 --> 20:02.920
&lrm;Thank you, Ladybug.

20:03.080 --> 20:05.840
&lrm;And don't worry,
&lrm;I know about you and Cat Noir, it's OK.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.160
&lrm;Didn't find it.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.240
<i>&lrm;To hear your message, press 1.</i>

20:22.760 --> 20:25.160
<i>&lrm;To erase your message, press 2.</i>

20:27.280 --> 20:29.440
<i>&lrm;Your message has been erased.</i>

20:29.600 --> 20:31.680
&lrm;I'm gonna tell him I found his phone.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.240
&lrm;That'd be a good way to start
&lrm;a conversation, wouldn't it?

20:34.400 --> 20:35.440
&lrm;Then I'll ask him out.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.120
&lrm;That's my girl.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.800
&lrm;[Nino] Maybe you dropped it.

20:39.960 --> 20:42.440
&lrm;Then whoever has it
&lrm;found it in the locker room.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.600
&lrm;[Alya whispers] Do it now.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.040
&lrm;I had it during fencing practice.

20:50.440 --> 20:51.880
&lrm;What in the...?

20:53.160 --> 20:54.520
&lrm;I already looked in here.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.040
&lrm;You need some time off.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.080
&lrm;I know, let's go to the movies.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.880
&lrm;Hey, dudes,
&lrm;mind if a few friends tag along?

21:00.960 --> 21:02.240
&lrm;Sure thing!

21:04.920 --> 21:07.000
&lrm;Yay!
