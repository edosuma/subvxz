00:13.003 --> 00:15.042
- Hello.
- Hi, what can l get you?

00:15.213 --> 00:20.837
- l'm a phone company repairman.
- l'm a bartender. Ernie Pantusso.

00:21.012 --> 00:24.427
Phil Ryan.
l got a call to come down here.

00:24.598 --> 00:28.382
There must be some mistake, Phil.
l didn't call for any repairman.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.396
- l think Sam put in a call, Coach.
- He did?

00:31.564 --> 00:34.019
He didn't say anything to me.

00:34.192 --> 00:38.190
l'd better give him a call
and find out what this is all about.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.785
Bum luck, Phil, phone's out.

00:48.666 --> 00:51.832
Give him a couple of seconds.

00:53.378 --> 00:58.754
l hate to impose, but since they
got you here on this royal goose chase,

00:58.927 --> 01:01.133
would you take a look at the phone?

01:01.304 --> 01:03.794
- Sure.
- Thank you.

01:06.183 --> 01:09.101
Lucky thing he happened by here.

01:09.271 --> 01:13.055
Sometimes fate takes a hand, Coach.

02:28.105 --> 02:31.854
Hi, everybody. l bet you're surprised
to see me on my night off.

02:32.025 --> 02:35.062
Yeah, we didn't hear your broom pull up.

02:36.071 --> 02:37.695
What are you doing here?

02:37.864 --> 02:41.779
l'm having dinner upstairs
with Frasier and his mother.

02:41.953 --> 02:45.737
She's a seafood aficionado,
we think she'll like the bouillabaisse.

02:45.915 --> 02:49.201
You're having dinner
with Frasier's mother?

02:49.377 --> 02:52.663
You deduced l'm having dinner
with Frasier and his mother

02:52.838 --> 02:55.757
when all l did
was say it in your presence.

02:57.845 --> 03:02.387
No flash cards, no crib notes
on your sleeve? Uncanny.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.847
We're a little edgy tonight, aren't we?

03:05.019 --> 03:08.933
But l can't blame you. Meeting Mom
is a big step in a relationship.

03:09.107 --> 03:13.816
Granted, meeting your prospective
fiancé's mother,

03:13.987 --> 03:19.230
especially an eminent psychiatrist,
trained to analyse a person's behaviour,

03:19.409 --> 03:22.494
could be a nerve-racking evening,

03:22.663 --> 03:26.363
for somebody who's going to be there,
but l'm not. Good night.

03:27.125 --> 03:31.420
- Chickening out, Diane? - Not at all.
They're 1 2 seconds late.

03:31.589 --> 03:35.586
Get back here.
Sit down and have a glass of wine.

03:35.759 --> 03:37.384
Coach...

03:39.763 --> 03:43.132
Sit down, honey, and relax.
Everything will be fine.

03:44.102 --> 03:49.014
Just remember, don't snap your gum,
don't chew with your mouth open,

03:49.191 --> 03:53.235
and for God's sake,
don't play with your bra straps.

03:55.614 --> 03:58.983
- l'll try to remember.
- Trying's not good enough.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.995
l'll have to write it down for you.

04:02.163 --> 04:04.833
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

04:05.833 --> 04:09.533
- What would you say to a nice beer?
- Going down.

04:12.840 --> 04:18.297
Coach, do me a favour and don't make
a big fuss over me today, OK?

04:18.471 --> 04:22.933
- You got it.
- No cakes, candles, party hats, singing.

04:23.101 --> 04:25.854
- None of that.
- OK.

04:27.648 --> 04:31.267
You know, because it would be
so embarrassing.

04:31.444 --> 04:33.982
And no gifts, all right?

04:38.451 --> 04:40.989
And don't ask how old l am today.

04:41.162 --> 04:43.832
Normie, is today your birthday?

04:43.998 --> 04:46.490
Coach, you remembered?

04:48.254 --> 04:50.293
Everybody, it's Normie's birthday.

04:53.634 --> 04:55.959
Let me buy the birthday boy a drink.

04:56.137 --> 04:59.092
Please, you're making
too big a deal out of this.

05:00.891 --> 05:04.426
There you are, my darling.
At last you two meet.

05:04.604 --> 05:07.771
The woman who gave me life
and the woman who gives me life.

05:07.942 --> 05:10.514
Oh, Frasier.

05:10.694 --> 05:14.229
Forgive me. l lose my head
in the company of beautiful women.

05:14.405 --> 05:18.239
- Dr Crane...
- Oh, please, dear, call me Hester.

05:18.410 --> 05:21.861
- Hester, it's a pleasure.
- lt's my pleasure.

05:22.040 --> 05:24.197
Let me take your coat, Mother.

05:24.375 --> 05:27.827
Diane...

05:28.004 --> 05:31.788
- Here's the list of tips l promised.
- Thank you, Coach.

05:31.967 --> 05:37.424
l also added instructions
for a dainty way to dispose of gristle.

05:39.725 --> 05:41.764
Frasier, she's lovely.

05:42.394 --> 05:47.103
He's made no secret of the fact,
but even he didn't do you justice.

05:47.274 --> 05:52.861
Well, in an anxiety-provoking situation
such as this,

05:53.031 --> 05:57.906
one tends to respond with exaggerated
compliments. Let me just be frank.

05:58.077 --> 06:02.455
You are the most strikingly handsome
woman l've ever laid eyes on.

06:03.083 --> 06:08.244
Something exciting is happening here.
Exciting, but not surprising.

06:08.422 --> 06:11.874
l say by the end of the evening
you two will be thick as thieves.

06:12.050 --> 06:15.965
Only if we can't resist the temptation
to pig out on cheesecake.

06:18.265 --> 06:23.557
- Hey, Doc, Vic's ready for you upstairs.
- l hope everybody's got an appetite.

06:23.730 --> 06:26.518
l'll never eat again.

06:28.485 --> 06:34.358
Let me hurry on up and make sure we've
got a good table. l'm thick with Vic.

06:34.532 --> 06:35.992
Well, Mother...

06:36.160 --> 06:40.074
- Boy, did you see that?
- What?

06:40.247 --> 06:44.032
Frasier purposely avoided
drawing me into the conversation.

06:44.210 --> 06:47.661
l noticed that, too, Cliffie.
What's his problem?

06:47.839 --> 06:51.043
He knows how well versed
l am in his field, Coach.

06:51.218 --> 06:54.718
l've embarrassed
many a professional so-called expert.

06:54.888 --> 06:59.384
Actually, Cliff, l think you've
embarrassed everybody you know.

06:59.560 --> 07:03.344
As long as you're saying it,
it's not bragging.

07:03.522 --> 07:08.019
- Norm! When did you get here?
- 36 years ago today.

07:08.194 --> 07:11.645
- lt's my buddy Norm's birthday today.
- ls that right?

07:11.823 --> 07:15.820
l think the birthday of one of my best
customers deserves some bubbly.

07:15.994 --> 07:19.031
- No, no, no.
- Maybe you're right.

07:19.205 --> 07:22.159
- Just kidding!
- You got me!

07:22.335 --> 07:26.462
Open this up, Coach. Congratulations,
and many happy returns.

07:26.630 --> 07:29.251
Just don't go singing ''Happy Birthday''.

07:29.425 --> 07:33.008
Cos l'd really hate that,
if you sang ''Happy Birthday''.

07:33.178 --> 07:35.219
Yeah, just because it is my...

07:40.979 --> 07:43.018
Cut it out! Come on, now!

07:50.405 --> 07:52.778
- Norm!
- Are you OK?

07:52.949 --> 07:56.070
- You OK, buddy?
- Yeah, yeah. l'm all right.

07:56.245 --> 07:58.700
That sucker nearly hit me.

08:00.374 --> 08:02.414
Hold still now.

08:04.462 --> 08:08.543
Why don't you
sit down here for a second?

08:08.716 --> 08:10.839
- You all right?
- Yeah.

08:11.010 --> 08:13.050
- How many fingers?
- Three.

08:13.221 --> 08:16.340
- Not you, Coach.
- Three.

08:16.516 --> 08:19.304
Sure, after l give him the answer.

08:19.477 --> 08:21.517
- You sure?
- l'm fine.

08:21.687 --> 08:24.441
The primary symptom
of postprandial trauma

08:24.608 --> 08:27.015
is the blurring of the metatarsals.

08:27.195 --> 08:30.361
- Cliff, shut up.
- Fine, l'll shut up.

08:30.531 --> 08:34.577
Go ahead and wallow in ignorance.
We're re-entering the Dark Ages.

08:34.744 --> 08:39.073
- Do we gain an hour or lose an hour?
- Would you guys cut it out?

08:39.248 --> 08:42.618
Why don't you see a doctor?
That thing hit you pretty hard.

08:42.794 --> 08:46.163
Play it safe, go to the emergency room.
l'll pay for it.

08:46.340 --> 08:48.913
No, it doesn't even hurt any more.

08:49.093 --> 08:56.222
Normie's right. l got hit all the time
in baseball. l never saw a doctor.

08:56.392 --> 08:59.393
- You'll keep my glass chilled?
- Yeah.

09:04.609 --> 09:08.025
Yeah, terrific, Normie, l'll pass that on.

09:08.196 --> 09:10.485
Everybody, Normie's just fine.

09:10.657 --> 09:14.027
They're just keeping him in
overnight for a few more tests.

09:14.202 --> 09:20.621
A lot of people miss the whimsy in Jung.
He's given me many a chuckle.

09:20.793 --> 09:26.797
l wrote one of my favourite papers on it.
lt's entitled, ''Hello, Jung Lovers.''

09:27.800 --> 09:30.042
How clever.

09:31.388 --> 09:36.346
Oh, dear. l hope l haven't dominated
the conversation tonight.

09:36.518 --> 09:40.932
Nonsense, the wine and your verbiage
went perfectly with our meal.

09:41.107 --> 09:46.979
Listen, why don't you two have
a seat and l'll get us a fine cordial.

09:47.154 --> 09:51.152
Will you trust me to make the selection?
l have a little treat in mind,

09:51.327 --> 09:53.365
l'd like to surprise you with it.

09:53.536 --> 09:56.109
Frasier, you're mad, but l love you.

09:56.289 --> 09:58.448
Three cans of Schlitz.

10:04.131 --> 10:06.170
Listen carefully.

10:06.342 --> 10:11.716
Stop seeing my son or,
as God is my witness, l'll kill you.

10:14.016 --> 10:17.101
- Something to munch on.
- Yum, yum, yum.

10:17.855 --> 10:21.686
Now listen to me.
l have a gun, l know how to use it.

10:23.444 --> 10:25.482
Here we are.

10:25.653 --> 10:28.988
Doesn't that look lovely?
What do you call it?

10:29.158 --> 10:34.946
- lt's a delightful pear liqueur.
- Sounds delicious, doesn't it, Diane?

10:37.917 --> 10:40.040
l think she likes it.

10:40.211 --> 10:43.960
l hate to leave your company again,
but l must visit the men's room.

10:44.132 --> 10:47.963
You know what they say, you only rent
a Château Lafite Rothschild.

10:48.136 --> 10:50.175
l'll go with you.

10:50.346 --> 10:53.846
Diane, there are some things
a man must do alone.

10:54.016 --> 10:57.433
lf you love me, you won't do this now.

10:58.647 --> 11:02.775
Well, it's a peculiar test
of a man's affection,

11:02.944 --> 11:05.398
but l think l'm up to it.

11:05.571 --> 11:07.729
l've just had an inspiration.

11:07.906 --> 11:11.276
What say we go to an intimate cabaret
and hear some jazz?

11:11.452 --> 11:16.908
That's a wonderful idea, Frasier.
How do you feel about it, Diane?

11:18.085 --> 11:21.952
Diane, you're white as a sheet.
Are you OK?

11:22.130 --> 11:24.170
l'm a little tired, Frasier.

11:24.342 --> 11:27.758
- Why don't you two go without me?
- We wouldn't think of it.

11:27.928 --> 11:30.679
No, l insist.

11:30.847 --> 11:35.060
l'll be fine. l'll call a cab. l wouldn't want
to spoil your fun. Please.

11:35.227 --> 11:37.849
She's tired. Don't press her.

11:38.021 --> 11:41.023
Go home, dear. Rest.

11:41.192 --> 11:45.736
You need a night on the town
like you need a hole in the head.

11:48.199 --> 11:51.403
l'll be fine, thank you.

11:51.619 --> 11:54.741
Very well. l'll call you later.

12:02.215 --> 12:06.083
- How did dinner go?
- She wants to kill me.

12:06.261 --> 12:09.926
You've got to start picking up
some checks, Diane.

12:16.521 --> 12:19.771
Sam, l have to ask you a question.

12:19.941 --> 12:23.311
And promise me
you won't make a joke out of it. OK?

12:23.487 --> 12:28.445
- l promise. What's up?
- Do you think l'm crazy?

12:28.617 --> 12:30.195
Yes.

12:34.917 --> 12:38.333
Now the joke is out of the way,
will you help me?

12:38.503 --> 12:41.671
l know this is a strange question,
but it's important.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.711
Do you think l'm...crazy?

12:45.760 --> 12:47.670
Yes.

12:48.722 --> 12:53.965
You're incapable of a rational
conversation, only flip remarks.

12:54.145 --> 12:58.891
Wait a minute. Do you mean
are you crazy, like seriously unbalanced,

12:59.067 --> 13:01.439
like losing your grasp on reality?

13:01.611 --> 13:04.103
- Yes.
- Oh, well, then...

13:04.281 --> 13:06.238
...yes.

13:07.951 --> 13:12.661
When you're ready to discuss this
as an adult, then we will talk.

13:13.791 --> 13:18.003
Do l sense a bit of tension between
you and dear old Mother Crane?

13:19.296 --> 13:21.753
l don't want to blow this
out of proportion.

13:21.924 --> 13:25.709
Doesn't every woman feel
their mother-in-law-to-be

13:25.886 --> 13:30.182
is an evil, dark-hearted,
psychotic murderess?

13:30.350 --> 13:34.929
- l mean competitor.
- What exactly did she say?

13:35.105 --> 13:37.941
l don't remember it word for word.
Something about,

13:38.109 --> 13:40.646
''l have a gun
and l know how to use it.''

13:40.820 --> 13:45.896
Before she left, she said l needed a
night on the town like a hole in the head.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.867
That's kinda cute.

13:51.289 --> 13:54.573
You think a death threat is cute?

13:54.751 --> 13:57.668
Not as a rule, no. But...

13:57.838 --> 14:01.289
...your sense of humour
is not exactly your strong point.

14:01.466 --> 14:04.917
ls it possible
that this lady is joking with you?

14:05.095 --> 14:09.045
Anything is possible,
but what's funny about...

14:09.225 --> 14:12.345
...a hole in the head?

14:12.521 --> 14:15.686
God...

14:15.858 --> 14:18.609
ls it possible?

14:18.776 --> 14:22.275
l feel so foolish.
She must think l'm a twit.

14:22.446 --> 14:26.576
Don't worry, when l first met you,
l thought you were a twit, too.

14:27.452 --> 14:31.497
Boy, this gal is a real kidder.

14:31.666 --> 14:35.200
l mean, we're talking veritable goose.

14:35.378 --> 14:37.453
We're having lunch together,

14:37.629 --> 14:42.624
so l can show Hester
that l can give as good as l get.

14:47.014 --> 14:49.138
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

14:49.308 --> 14:52.226
- What's up?
- Everything that's supposed to be.

14:53.229 --> 14:56.315
Norm,
l hear you spent the night in hospital.

14:56.484 --> 14:59.483
- l'm OK, though.
- Good.

14:59.653 --> 15:04.232
You can just take care of this
at your leisure, l suppose.

15:05.576 --> 15:07.983
$683?

15:08.162 --> 15:11.745
- To have your head checked?
- lsn't that something?

15:11.916 --> 15:15.452
They did a whole battery of tests on me.

15:15.629 --> 15:22.877
- The important thing is l'm OK, isn't it?
- Well, no. l mean, yes, but $683!

15:23.053 --> 15:27.300
The cost of diagnostic testing
has gone up dramatically.

15:27.474 --> 15:30.678
l read recently
it's running to billions every year.

15:30.853 --> 15:35.515
Gee, l didn't know so many people
got hit by corks.

15:35.691 --> 15:40.899
- What did they do to you down there?
- Mostly routine stuff.

15:41.073 --> 15:44.406
l did take care of one other little matter.

15:44.575 --> 15:47.363
- Like what?
- l had a little mole removed.

15:47.537 --> 15:53.042
- And you stuck me with it?
- Norm, where did you have a mole?

15:53.836 --> 15:58.082
That must have been the one
on your butt there, right?

15:58.257 --> 16:03.252
Norm, l didn't know you were that...vain.

16:03.429 --> 16:05.837
Who's ever going to see your rear end?

16:06.014 --> 16:08.507
You're just about to, wise guy.

16:11.397 --> 16:14.101
l think you took advantage of me, Norm.

16:14.274 --> 16:17.110
l figured you'd want to throw in the mole.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.113
Makes a nice birthday gift, you know.

16:20.281 --> 16:22.772
You want to be hard-nosed,
l'll pay for it.

16:22.949 --> 16:24.693
No, no.

16:24.869 --> 16:27.442
Happy birthday.

16:27.622 --> 16:31.157
- Thank you, it's just what l wanted.
- You're welcome.

16:31.334 --> 16:35.712
l know it's a little early, but l wouldn't
say no to a tummy tuck for Christmas.

16:36.715 --> 16:41.177
l'll think about it.
Diane, look who's here.

16:42.387 --> 16:46.433
lf you have knees,
prepare to slap them now.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.143
Hello, dear.

16:48.310 --> 16:51.311
- You're feeling better?
- Much better.

16:51.480 --> 16:55.562
lf Sam will let us steal you away,
l have reservations for three for lunch.

16:55.735 --> 16:57.775
Sounds good.

16:57.945 --> 17:03.236
Hester, l've been thinking a lot
about our little talk last night.

17:03.410 --> 17:06.445
l hope you've been thinking
long and hard.

17:06.621 --> 17:08.365
l have.

17:08.540 --> 17:11.707
Frasier, l came to a decision last night.

17:11.877 --> 17:17.416
lf we marry, l think we should commit
mommy dearest to a rest home,

17:17.590 --> 17:21.970
making sure that beating and starving
are the only forms of recreation.

17:22.137 --> 17:23.336
Diane!

17:23.513 --> 17:25.721
l beg your pardon?

17:25.892 --> 17:28.976
ln fact, l feel like slapping
your face right now.

17:29.145 --> 17:31.304
Take me out of here this moment.

17:31.481 --> 17:35.859
lt's a joke, come on.
l'm obviously kidding.

17:36.028 --> 17:39.776
We won't put her in a rest home,
we'll have her with us always.

17:39.949 --> 17:42.903
We're going to have her stuffed.

17:46.080 --> 17:49.580
And l'll even slit her throat
in the process. Thank you, Sam.

17:53.171 --> 17:58.165
l've never encountered such hostility,
personally or professionally. l'm leaving.

17:58.343 --> 18:01.713
No, just a minute, let's all take a beat.

18:03.056 --> 18:05.927
The three of us
are going into Sam's office

18:06.102 --> 18:08.592
and we'll work this thing through.

18:08.771 --> 18:13.848
There's got to be a logical explanation.
And there'd better be, Diane.

18:14.026 --> 18:18.238
lt's all a joke. Hester,
you're with me on this, aren't you?

18:18.406 --> 18:24.361
lf terrible threats constitute jokes,
no, l'm not with you on this.

18:29.084 --> 18:34.292
OK, time to take stock here.
l'm not crazy, right, Diane?

18:34.464 --> 18:36.706
Right you are.

18:38.051 --> 18:41.504
A whole year of my life.

18:41.680 --> 18:47.352
Hester, l was trying to joke with you
like you were joking with me.

18:47.521 --> 18:50.605
lf you weren't joking,
you threatened my life...

18:50.774 --> 18:52.767
- l what?
- What?

18:52.943 --> 18:58.103
She said that if l didn't stop seeing you,
she'd shoot me.

18:59.157 --> 19:01.197
This was obviously a mistake.

19:01.369 --> 19:05.616
You know perfectly well
you threatened my life!

19:05.790 --> 19:08.542
l will not stay and be talked to like this.

19:08.710 --> 19:12.542
Frasier, she is a rude,
boorish, spiteful woman,

19:12.713 --> 19:17.460
who, for some reason
l don't understand, resents me terribly.

19:17.636 --> 19:21.716
- Mother, please.
- Liar, liar, pants on fire.

19:21.890 --> 19:26.185
- Diane!
- l'm not lying. She is.

19:26.353 --> 19:29.972
lf you love me, you'll stand up for me
now when l need it.

19:30.149 --> 19:34.193
Frasier, l'm asking you
to leave with me now.

19:35.905 --> 19:40.817
Frasier, this is the most important
moment in our relationship.

19:40.993 --> 19:43.664
lf you abandon me now, that's it.

19:50.211 --> 19:54.045
Mother, why did you threaten Diane?

19:55.718 --> 19:58.838
- You believe her?
- Yes.

20:00.514 --> 20:03.350
Oh, God!

20:05.020 --> 20:07.427
l've lost you.

20:10.066 --> 20:16.735
Frasier, l did say those terrible things,
but, believe me, l had good reason.

20:16.908 --> 20:19.363
OK, she said them,
but she had good reasons.

20:19.535 --> 20:22.785
- Not good enough!
- They'd better be good!

20:22.955 --> 20:25.826
The best in the world.

20:26.001 --> 20:31.789
l wanted to save you from ruining
what could be a brilliant career.

20:32.591 --> 20:36.127
l just can't stand the picture
of you being married

20:36.303 --> 20:40.466
to a pseudo-intellectual barmaid.

20:40.641 --> 20:43.677
No offence intended.

20:44.896 --> 20:47.101
None taken. Ç <i>ne fit rien.</i>

20:47.272 --> 20:50.689
Mother, l can't believe this of you,

20:50.860 --> 20:55.902
a woman who has always been the most
gentle, rational human being l've known.

20:56.073 --> 21:01.281
My dear boy, you know l would never
follow through on my threat to kill her.

21:02.373 --> 21:06.074
As l was pricing revolvers this morning,

21:06.251 --> 21:10.200
l realised how irrational
my feelings were.

21:10.380 --> 21:13.002
But don't you understand?

21:13.175 --> 21:19.214
l'd rather see you shovelling sherbet
at Howard Johnson's

21:19.390 --> 21:24.182
in a silly hat and an apron
than make a bad marriage.

21:24.353 --> 21:27.224
Mother, you don't understand.

21:27.399 --> 21:32.227
We're not going to have a bad marriage.
And l'm not going to shovel sherbet.

21:32.404 --> 21:37.565
But l would be happy doing it
if Diane were at my side.

21:40.495 --> 21:43.450
Oh, Frasier,

21:43.624 --> 21:48.500
l never realised how much
this woman meant to you.

21:50.089 --> 21:54.882
Of course,
l don't really understand why.

21:56.681 --> 22:02.553
l never understood your spider collection
either, but l grew to accept that.

22:04.187 --> 22:07.770
Diane, she's reaching out. Please.

22:13.197 --> 22:17.492
Doctor Crane, l'm sorry
if l made a bad first impression,

22:17.661 --> 22:23.497
but l think, no, l know,
it was a wrong impression.

22:23.667 --> 22:28.744
l may be a diamond in the rough now,
but l'm a dreamer,

22:30.340 --> 22:33.675
and l have a habit
of making dreams come true.

22:33.845 --> 22:37.214
When and if l marry Frasier Crane,

22:37.390 --> 22:42.098
l will be the kind of wife and family
you'll be proud to know and claim.

22:43.730 --> 22:47.514
People will get tired hearing
you boast about your daughter-in-law.

22:48.401 --> 22:52.233
Diane, l see l've handled this so badly.

22:53.240 --> 23:00.489
Well, yes...l suppose
l've made a few mistakes myself.

23:01.915 --> 23:07.586
- Let's go out and come in again.
- l'd love to.

23:09.465 --> 23:13.844
This is the most incredible moment
of my entire day.

23:14.013 --> 23:19.600
l'm going to take you two future best pals
out to the finest lunch in town.

23:19.769 --> 23:22.888
- Sounds good
- OK.

23:31.906 --> 23:34.479
l need a glass of water.

23:34.659 --> 23:38.657
You two, go ahead, l'll catch up with you.

23:41.374 --> 23:43.616
That's OK. lt's free of charge.

23:43.794 --> 23:47.245
l understand you used to date
that woman.

23:47.422 --> 23:51.884
l want to know how much you'd charge
to start things up again.

23:52.970 --> 23:55.758
- You don't have enough money.
- How would you know?

23:55.931 --> 24:00.060
There isn't enough money.

24:00.228 --> 24:03.562
- l know what you mean.
- l don't think you do.

24:03.732 --> 24:05.724
- l think l do.
- Oh, no.

24:05.901 --> 24:08.190
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, no.
