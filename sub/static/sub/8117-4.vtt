WEBVTT

00:03.836 --> 00:05.306
Corporal Reilly?
Yeah?

00:05.339 --> 00:07.375
Do we have patrols running
the perimeter tonight?

00:07.408 --> 00:09.443
Not that I'm aware of. Why?

00:09.477 --> 00:12.646
Because I think
I've got something.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.282
You always got something.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.585
No, this is definitely
something.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.153
Red reading. Warm blood.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.554
I think it's human.

00:23.491 --> 00:27.428
Gotta be a Sixer. If there's
one, there's bound to be more.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.563
Better get Wash on the line.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.110
There! Go, go, go!

00:50.651 --> 00:52.686
Dunham, go around. Go!

01:02.496 --> 01:05.399
There. Biker One,
coming your way.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.831
This won't hurt a bit.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.169
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:44.438 --> 01:47.708
Calm down, all right?!
Nobody's gonna hurt you!

01:50.678 --> 01:52.446
Wash? Where is she?

01:52.480 --> 01:54.448
She is right
over there.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.885
She's here?
Yeah.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.190
Hi.

02:06.660 --> 02:07.595
She's terrified.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.297
I need to get
everybody out of here

02:09.330 --> 02:11.699
and just clear some
space for us, all right?

02:11.732 --> 02:12.800
That includes you.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.669
Understood, but I want
to talk to her, Doc.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.171
Okay, just give me

02:17.205 --> 02:19.873
a few minutes alone
with her, all right?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.314
Hey, little one,
don't be frightened.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.648
No one's gonna hurt you.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.383
I'm Dr. Shannon.

02:29.417 --> 02:30.884
Do you know
where you are?

02:30.918 --> 02:32.420
Under a table.

02:34.087 --> 02:36.690
Sorry about my colleagues.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.559
I don't think they meant
to scare you.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.828
They want to give me a shot.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.730
Don't like shots.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.097
Do you have a name?

02:44.131 --> 02:46.367
If I tell you, can I go?

02:46.400 --> 02:48.436
Perhaps. Once I've taken
a look at you.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.772
Why don't you come out
here and talk to me?

02:51.805 --> 02:52.673
No.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.942
Okay.

02:54.975 --> 02:57.245
What if I promised
no shots,

02:57.278 --> 02:59.112
just this?

02:59.146 --> 03:00.848
It's just a light.
Won't hurt you. Look.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.585
Would you come out then, yeah?

03:04.618 --> 03:05.953
Okay.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.428
Okay.

03:21.402 --> 03:24.338
I lost my bag.

03:24.372 --> 03:25.739
In the jungle?

03:25.773 --> 03:28.309
They were chasing me,
and I dropped it.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.778
Don't like chases.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.780
Well, that's okay.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.649
We can get somebody
to go look for your bag.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.692
So, you gonna tell me your name?

03:46.827 --> 03:48.462
Leah Marcos.

03:48.496 --> 03:52.866
So, do you have somebody waiting
for you back at home...

03:52.900 --> 03:54.502
or camp?

03:56.003 --> 03:57.805
What about your mother?

03:57.838 --> 03:59.907
Dead.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.942
Pleural sar...

04:01.975 --> 04:03.243
Pleural sarcoma?

04:04.945 --> 04:05.946
I'm sorry.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.915
And your father?

04:07.948 --> 04:09.517
Slasher got him.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.987
Mira says it happens sometimes.

04:14.021 --> 04:15.789
Anybody hungry?

04:25.198 --> 04:27.435
Been awhile since you've eaten?

04:27.468 --> 04:30.003
Only get scraps.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.072
That's why I ran away.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.273
I'm gonna stay with my nana.

04:33.307 --> 04:34.908
She always had a lot of food.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.978
Does Nana live

04:38.011 --> 04:40.013
in Terra Nova?

04:40.047 --> 04:42.350
9007 Newberry Avenue,

04:42.383 --> 04:44.952
apartment C, district ten,

04:44.985 --> 04:46.286
New Texas.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.221
I'm going back to 2149.

04:48.255 --> 04:50.991
I tried to find the portal, but
I got turned around backwards.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.526
Which way is it?

04:52.560 --> 04:54.094
Finish your food.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.830
We'll talk about it later.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.735
Taylor here.

05:01.769 --> 05:02.836
Talk to me.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.172
Perimeter is clear, over.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.173
Copy that.
Taylor out.

05:06.206 --> 05:07.140
Commander Taylor?

05:07.174 --> 05:10.010
That's would be me.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.745
You're the bad man.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.986
You know, I remember you.

05:19.019 --> 05:22.890
Marcos. Leah Marcos.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.626
Been a long time
since I've seen you.

05:25.659 --> 05:30.063
Last time I saw you,
you were just about that big.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.365
You were just a peanut.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.966
I grew.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.968
So you did.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.470
You know, there was a time

05:36.504 --> 05:39.873
when I knew everybody's name
in Terra Nova: Man,

05:39.907 --> 05:42.142
woman and peanut.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.812
You got a brother, right? Sam.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.752
Well, her BMI is lower
than I'd like it to be,

05:51.785 --> 05:54.321
and I'd like to get
some more fluids in her,

05:54.354 --> 05:56.189
but she's generally
healthy.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.391
I'm going now.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.059
Leah!

05:59.092 --> 06:01.729
Hold on there, kiddo.
It's okay, Leah, Leah.

06:01.762 --> 06:05.232
This is my husband, right?
This is Jim. It's okay.

06:05.265 --> 06:06.934
You're all right, okay?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.403
Listen, Leah,

06:09.437 --> 06:11.271
we got something
we need to tell you.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.540
I need you to listen

06:12.573 --> 06:14.341
to me carefully,
Leah, okay?

06:14.374 --> 06:18.178
You know the portal?
It doesn't go both ways.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.813
What?

06:19.847 --> 06:24.952
Once you come through,
you can't go back.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.220
You're lying!

06:27.254 --> 06:29.289
I'm sorry,
sweetheart.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.224
So I can't go see my grandma?

06:31.258 --> 06:33.160
No, I'm afraid you can't.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.795
Where do I go now?

06:34.828 --> 06:38.365
I can't stay here,
not with the bad man.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.200
And I can't go back to Mira's.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.702
She'll...

06:41.735 --> 06:45.473
she'll hurt me
for running away.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.015
That is one tough young lady.

06:55.048 --> 06:59.152
Imagine that, humping
through the jungle on her own

06:59.186 --> 07:01.655
from God knows where.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.791
It's amazing she made
it as far as she did.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.393
You know, this could turn out
to be a good thing for us.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.795
How do you mean?

07:07.828 --> 07:10.163
Oh, we need intel
on the Sixers.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.833
Where is it they hide out?

07:12.866 --> 07:16.036
Who's their inside man
here in Terra Nova?

07:16.069 --> 07:17.871
But she's just a kid.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.873
I mean, how much
could she really know?

07:19.907 --> 07:22.510
Well, we won't know anything
till we gain her trust,

07:22.543 --> 07:24.111
make her feel at home.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.513
How's she doing?

07:25.546 --> 07:26.880
You know, she's still upset,

07:26.914 --> 07:28.849
but I think I managed
to calm her down.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.552
You do seem to have
that effect on her.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.353
You know,
till we find her

07:33.386 --> 07:34.555
a permanent place to live,

07:34.588 --> 07:36.156
she's gonna need
somewhere to stay.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.125
Well, she can stay with us.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.192
Right, Jim?

07:39.226 --> 07:41.428
Elisabeth?

07:41.461 --> 07:44.131
So, what, our
family's six now?

07:44.164 --> 07:45.298
Come on.

07:45.332 --> 07:47.000
She can have Josh's room.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.669
He'll be fine
on the couch for a while.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.538
It's settled then.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.640
Very good.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.479
Why do I have to
give up my room?

07:59.513 --> 08:01.682
Because Zoe's six
and I'm a girl, Josh.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.784
What does that have
to do with anything?

08:06.086 --> 08:08.288
- Okay, shush. That's them.
- Be nice.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.857
Hey, everyone.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.992
Hey.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.394
Josh, come here.

08:14.427 --> 08:18.465
Hey. Everyone,
this is Leah Marcos.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.167
Leah, this is our son, Josh.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.402
Hello. Welcome.

08:22.435 --> 08:24.572
And this is our
eldest daughter, Maddy.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.807
She's gonna be starting
an apprenticeship

08:26.840 --> 08:28.241
at the infirmary
with me tomorrow.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.977
Hi.

08:30.811 --> 08:34.847
And this is our
youngest, Zoe.

08:37.684 --> 08:41.087
You know, Zoe's got
a plant that eats bugs,

08:41.121 --> 08:42.389
and in her spare time,

08:42.422 --> 08:45.726
she makes these
toy dinosaurs.

08:46.393 --> 08:49.597
Pretty cool, huh?

08:50.397 --> 08:54.234
Well, uh, bathroom's
through there.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.336
And the kitchen's over there,

08:56.369 --> 08:58.338
in case you get
hungry again.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.977
Um, do you want to see
where you're gonna sleep?

09:04.011 --> 09:06.747
Enough blankets, I think.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.728
It's okay.
It's only light.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.738
Here, make the bed up.

09:36.710 --> 09:40.313
We should...

09:40.347 --> 09:41.414
probably let her sleep.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.216
Yeah, okay.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.528
I don't even know
what the kid's bag

09:55.562 --> 09:56.797
is supposed to look like.

09:56.830 --> 09:59.099
My guess? Dirty.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.871
Hey, found it!

10:08.408 --> 10:09.408
Cute.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.743
Still doing Taylor's dirty work.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.145
What have you done with her?

11:35.628 --> 11:37.564
How'd Leah sleep
last night?

11:37.597 --> 11:40.633
Oh, she was out cold
for 14 hours.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.635
And she refused
to take a shower.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.571
Apparently, she's afraid
of hot water.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.106
Oh, nice.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.875
Maybe can we trade.
Leah can stay with us

11:47.908 --> 11:49.877
and Maddy can move in
with the Sixers.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.679
More hot showers for everyone.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.381
Sounds like a win-win to me.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.414
Good morning.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.721
I think yellow's your color.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.257
Don't like yellow. Itches.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.525
Okay.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.795
Breakfast?

12:10.663 --> 12:12.065
What about the hair, Mad?

12:12.099 --> 12:15.102
Baby steps, Mom.
She threw the brush at me.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.571
Jim, can you look after
the girls today?

12:18.605 --> 12:19.873
No. Gotta go see Taylor.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.842
A few things he wants
to talk about.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.811
Shouldn't take long.

12:23.844 --> 12:27.447
But I've got Maddy with me
at the hospital all day.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.316
Okay. Uh, Josh?
Yeah?

12:29.349 --> 12:32.019
Need you to babysit Leah and Zoe
till I get back. Few hours tops.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.586
What am I supposed
to do with them?

12:33.620 --> 12:34.988
Think of something.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.091
Have fun!

12:43.196 --> 12:44.597
So...

12:44.631 --> 12:47.300
Okay, what
do we have here?

12:47.334 --> 12:49.602
Rajiv Swarup,
36-year-old male.

12:49.636 --> 12:52.940
Laceration to his right arm.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.641
They gave me something
for the pain.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.443
It still hurts
like a son of...

12:56.476 --> 12:57.610
Let's take a look.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.579
Okay...

12:59.612 --> 13:01.849
How'd this happen?

13:01.882 --> 13:03.550
The autoplow jammed up.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.717
I tried to fix it.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.391
The next thing you know,
my arm's sausage.

13:07.955 --> 13:11.191
Ooh, Maddy, come take
a look at this.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.793
Uh, that's okay.
I'll just stand over here

13:13.827 --> 13:16.796
and observe... from over here.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.365
Last little bit.
It's okay.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.401
So that's probably
right into the...

13:24.037 --> 13:25.939
I sent Washington
out at dawn

13:25.973 --> 13:27.340
to look for
the girl's bag.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.843
Thought maybe it'd
buy us some good will.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.945
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.546
Morning, Trace.
Thank you.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.850
How soon is too soon to
start a debriefing?

13:36.884 --> 13:38.085
Today, tomorrow?

13:38.118 --> 13:40.320
Might want to give her
a little more time than that.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.789
I'll discuss it with
Elisabeth. All right.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.592
Sixers! Sixers!

13:49.196 --> 13:53.000
Sound the alarm!
To your posts!

14:03.977 --> 14:06.379
They've come for me.

14:07.214 --> 14:10.450
Hey, you're safe here, Leah.

14:10.483 --> 14:13.486
No one gets through the gates
unless Taylor says so.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.177
They've come for the girl.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.678
Whoever they got
on the inside

15:11.711 --> 15:13.446
tipped them she's here.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.951
Raise the gate.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.526
You got a spare
one of those?

15:26.994 --> 15:29.196
Thanks.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.272
So?

15:39.306 --> 15:42.475
You have something
that belongs to me.

15:42.509 --> 15:43.876
I want her back.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.512
Is that why you abducted
my people?

15:45.545 --> 15:48.481
Just returning the favor,
Taylor.

15:48.515 --> 15:49.516
The girl came to us.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.750
I don't believe you.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.885
I think your
people took her.

15:52.919 --> 15:55.322
I think she's being held
as your prisoner.

15:55.355 --> 15:58.125
I think we both know
that's not true.

16:02.029 --> 16:05.298
You want your people
back, give me the girl.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.968
This is not a negotiation.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.340
The girl will decide
her own fate.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.108
If she wants
to leave with you,

16:15.142 --> 16:16.043
she's free to go.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.911
Then bring her out here
and let's find out.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.514
As soon as you
release my people.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.521
Let them go.

16:28.555 --> 16:29.589
What?

16:29.622 --> 16:33.693
I said... let them go.

16:45.872 --> 16:48.541
Shannon, bring
the girl out here.

16:49.076 --> 16:51.278
Dad came and got Leah.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.112
What?

16:52.145 --> 16:53.880
Mira wants
to talk to her.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.682
Okay, look after your sister.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.251
But, Mom! Just do
it, Maddy. Come on.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.104
Just tell the truth.
It'll be okay.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.143
Leah, look at me.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.115
Tell them you want to come home.

17:31.918 --> 17:34.254
Speak!

17:38.558 --> 17:39.959
I ran away.

17:39.992 --> 17:43.029
I'm not going back
with you.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.165
I want to stay here.

17:46.933 --> 17:50.002
She's made her decision.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.571
The girl stays.

17:52.739 --> 17:53.773
Keep her then.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.609
She's nothing to me.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.889
This is the second time
you've come to my gates

18:09.922 --> 18:11.258
and threatened the colony.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.427
There won't be a third.

18:14.461 --> 18:18.698
Next time I'm going to war.

18:31.711 --> 18:34.681
I want a list of everybody
who was outside the gates

18:34.714 --> 18:37.217
from the time she got here
till 0900 this morning.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.619
Sometime in that
24-hour window,

18:39.652 --> 18:42.121
the spy must have got in
contact with the Sixers.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.424
Let's find him.
Okay.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.958
And you, hey, peanut,

18:45.992 --> 18:47.394
did great out there.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.028
You weren't even
scared, were you?

18:49.061 --> 18:51.498
No, I could see
that you weren't.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.066
You looked like you might even
throw a punch or something.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.635
Thought I'd have
to hold you back.

18:55.668 --> 19:00.006
Hey, let's see
what you got, huh?

19:00.039 --> 19:02.141
Come on.
Let me have it.

19:02.175 --> 19:03.510
Whack him.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.578
Ow! I knew it.

19:05.612 --> 19:08.748
That is a mean right
hand you've got there.

19:08.781 --> 19:11.618
Lethal. So keep practicing.
When you turn 18,

19:11.651 --> 19:13.820
I'm might have to
put you in uniform.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.888
I like uniforms.

19:18.658 --> 19:22.061
Look, I know you've heard some
pretty terrible things about me

19:22.094 --> 19:25.598
and I don't know how life is
out there with the Sixers,

19:25.632 --> 19:28.368
but, Leah, take a look around.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.939
People are happy here.
They're safe.

19:32.972 --> 19:36.376
Everybody's got a home
and nobody gets scraps.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.778
I don't like scraps.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.513
We move all the time.

19:40.547 --> 19:41.648
I don't like that either.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.683
Where do you move to?
Lots of places.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.453
Mira never lets us stay in
the same place for very long.

19:47.554 --> 19:48.855
You know how
to read a map?

19:48.888 --> 19:50.323
I like maps.

19:50.357 --> 19:52.058
My dad taught me
how to read them.

19:52.091 --> 19:54.827
Before the slasher ate him.

19:54.861 --> 19:55.795
Yeah.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.231
I tell you what.

19:58.265 --> 20:00.800
Maybe after you
get settled in,

20:00.833 --> 20:01.968
you and I can sit down,

20:02.001 --> 20:04.404
take a look at some of
the places you've stayed.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.039
Maybe you can show me
where your camp is.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.541
Deal?

20:11.811 --> 20:14.714
All right, I'm gonna
leave you in good hands.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.416
I need that list.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.419
Come on.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.188
Hey! Hello, there.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.223
Do you remember me?
'Cause I remember you.

20:24.257 --> 20:27.694
Little Leah Marcos.
Not so little anymore.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.563
You know, I never
forget a name or a face,

20:30.597 --> 20:34.133
but somewhere along the line,
I forgot my legs.

20:34.166 --> 20:37.337
So if you happen to see 'em
walking around without me,

20:37.370 --> 20:39.506
could you tell 'em
I'm looking for 'em?

20:40.507 --> 20:43.510
Hey...

20:44.777 --> 20:46.613
...welcome back to Terra Nova,
Leah Marcos.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.681
- Welcome back.
- Welcome!

20:49.416 --> 20:51.250
To Leah Marcos.

20:52.319 --> 20:53.620
To coming home.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.821
Cheers.

20:54.854 --> 20:55.988
Really.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.660
Hey, maybe tomorrow
we can put a comb

21:00.693 --> 21:01.804
through your hair,
you think?

21:01.828 --> 21:04.964
Don't like combs.

21:06.533 --> 21:09.602
Okay.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.270
You guys should have
seen Maddy

21:11.304 --> 21:12.872
on her first day
in the infirmary.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.106
She did a great job.

21:14.140 --> 21:17.610
Yeah, well, all I really did was
reorganize your storage locker

21:17.644 --> 21:18.845
and told you a patient's name.

21:18.878 --> 21:19.679
Well...

21:19.712 --> 21:21.213
No, to my
oldest daughter.

21:21.247 --> 21:22.849
The next doctor
in the Shannon family.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.518
Hear, hear. Cheers.

21:27.554 --> 21:29.822
So how's the mole hunt
going, Shannon?

21:29.856 --> 21:30.990
Give me an update.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.058
Okay, there was a team

21:32.091 --> 21:34.894
outside the gates doing
some perimeter mine repair

21:34.927 --> 21:36.763
from 0630 to about noon:

21:36.796 --> 21:40.967
Michelle Toomey
and, uh, Nhat Trang?

21:41.000 --> 21:42.735
No, I know 'em both.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.804
Good solid citizens.
Nothing there.

21:44.837 --> 21:47.374
Okay, and Science
Division had somebody out

21:47.407 --> 21:48.551
following up on
a field study.

21:48.575 --> 21:51.210
They took the CSO's rover
Robert Stanley.

21:51.243 --> 21:54.213
Stanley?
Did he go out alone?

21:54.246 --> 21:55.382
Yeah.

21:55.415 --> 21:56.883
Let's talk to him.

21:56.916 --> 21:57.884
Why him?

21:57.917 --> 22:00.319
He came in on
the Sixth Pilgrimage,

22:00.353 --> 22:01.754
but he didn't leave with Mira.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.255
Only about half of 'em did.

22:03.289 --> 22:04.691
We investigated
those who stayed,

22:04.724 --> 22:07.860
but we couldn't find any
connection to the Sixers.

22:07.894 --> 22:10.663
Maybe we missed
something with Stanley.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.437
But I thought we'd
been over this.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.906
And we'll keep going over it
till I say otherwise.

22:19.939 --> 22:22.208
I was completing
my field study on wax moss.

22:22.241 --> 22:23.009
This...

22:23.042 --> 22:25.177
I don't care
about your field study.

22:25.211 --> 22:26.913
Talk to me about
the Sixers.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.615
I don't know anything
about the Sixers.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.182
Well, you made
a radio transmission

22:30.216 --> 22:31.718
at 1100 hours
yesterday.

22:31.751 --> 22:32.919
Who were you
contacting?

22:32.952 --> 22:34.921
The lab, to let them
know I'd be late.

22:34.954 --> 22:36.956
Hey, Commander.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.526
What brings you
out here?

22:39.559 --> 22:41.928
Somebody tipped the Sixers off
about the girl.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.996
And you think it was Rob?

22:44.030 --> 22:45.832
You can't
be serious.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.734
I thought I'd ask
a few questions, yes.

22:47.767 --> 22:50.670
And do you have any
actual evidence against him?

22:50.703 --> 22:51.947
Enough to take him into custody?

22:51.971 --> 22:52.805
You his lawyer now?

22:52.839 --> 22:54.140
No. Funny enough,
we don't have

22:54.173 --> 22:55.975
any of those
around here, do we?

22:57.043 --> 22:58.177
Tread carefully, Malcolm.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.446
No, I don't think I will.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.614
This is guilt
by association.

23:01.648 --> 23:03.115
So what if he came over
on the Sixth?

23:03.149 --> 23:05.785
A lot of people did who have
nothing to do with Mira.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.053
Like the commander said,

23:07.086 --> 23:08.688
we're just asking
a few questions. Relax.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.790
Yeah, and that's what
they said to my father

23:10.823 --> 23:12.191
at the Edinburgh
Hearings of 2119.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.993
"Just asking
questions."

23:14.026 --> 23:15.327
That's how it starts, Jim.

23:15.361 --> 23:17.041
Get off your high horse,
will you, Malcolm?

23:25.672 --> 23:27.082
Don't be nervous.
It's just a small test

23:27.106 --> 23:28.975
to see what grade level
you'll do best in,

23:29.008 --> 23:30.910
and then, Monday,
you can start school.

23:30.943 --> 23:31.844
Sounds fun, right?

23:31.878 --> 23:33.813
Don't worry.
Jim will be by

23:33.846 --> 23:36.015
in a couple of hours
to pick you up.

23:36.048 --> 23:36.949
Okay?

23:36.983 --> 23:38.751
Thank you.

23:41.387 --> 23:42.989
Bye.

23:44.957 --> 23:45.725
She's so cute.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.293
Remember your first
day at school?

23:47.326 --> 23:49.028
You couldn't wait
to get there.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.329
Yeah, I loved it.

23:50.362 --> 23:53.132
Not gonna lie.
That's my gal.

23:58.370 --> 24:00.907
I'll, uh, catch up
with you.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.675
Mr. Shannon.

24:02.709 --> 24:03.876
Hey.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.344
I... I was hoping
to talk to you

24:05.377 --> 24:07.079
about your
daughter, Maddy.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.080
What about her?

24:08.114 --> 24:10.016
Well, as you know, I've
begun the initial stages

24:10.049 --> 24:11.918
of courting Maddy,
and I was wondering

24:11.951 --> 24:13.720
if I could...
Excuse me, Reynolds.

24:14.521 --> 24:16.155
You are aware
that I carry a gun,

24:16.188 --> 24:18.625
have a quick temper
and tend to hold grudges, right?

24:18.658 --> 24:20.059
Shannon.

24:20.092 --> 24:22.028
We had a break-in
at the McMillen place.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.195
Pod D-26.

24:23.229 --> 24:25.164
Let's move.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.038
So I've been
at work all day.

24:32.071 --> 24:35.474
Came home and found
the place broken into.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.209
And then this.

24:39.111 --> 24:40.580
What was inside?

24:40.613 --> 24:41.748
I don't know.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.950
I didn't even know
there was a hole here.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.052
Could you, uh,
give us a minute?

24:46.085 --> 24:47.954
Yeah, sure.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.355
Thanks.

24:49.388 --> 24:52.892
We need to find out who lived
here before the McMillens.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.637
See if they know anything
about what was buried

24:54.661 --> 24:56.204
under the floor.
That shouldn't be tough.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.030
Why?

24:58.064 --> 25:00.099
This used to be
Mira's old place.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.736
We need to find
Leah right now.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.363
Hey.

25:31.397 --> 25:33.065
What's going on
here, kiddo?

25:33.099 --> 25:36.002
What did you take
from those people's house, Leah?

25:36.035 --> 25:38.004
Leah!

25:38.037 --> 25:38.871
Stop! Stop!

25:38.905 --> 25:42.208
It's okay.
It's okay.

25:42.241 --> 25:43.910
Give me the bag.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.146
There's nowhere to run.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.163
No doubt about it, Commander.

26:04.196 --> 26:06.999
Mira sent her
to infiltrate Terra Nova.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.935
She's been lying to us
the whole time.

26:08.968 --> 26:11.170
It was theater, more or less.

26:11.203 --> 26:12.872
Mira played me.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.807
She knew I'd let
the kid in.

26:14.841 --> 26:16.075
Knew I'd believe
her story.

26:16.108 --> 26:18.510
Knew I wouldn't send her away,
especially if the Sixers

26:18.544 --> 26:20.780
made a show of trying
to get her back.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.448
She's the perfect spy.

26:22.481 --> 26:25.618
Young enough to be sympathetic,
but old enough to be capable.

26:25.652 --> 26:27.854
First chance she got,
she broke into that house

26:27.887 --> 26:29.856
and grabbed this... container

26:29.889 --> 26:33.392
or whatever thing this is.

26:33.425 --> 26:34.861
Does it open?

26:34.894 --> 26:37.196
Sealed shut, no visible seams.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.166
Sounds like it's hollow.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.701
Ask her how to open it.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.369
She might not know.

26:43.402 --> 26:45.537
Might not tell us
even if she does know.

26:45.571 --> 26:47.306
Bring her in.

27:02.889 --> 27:05.124
Have a seat,
kiddo.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.232
Hey.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.968
I'm not going to ask you
why you did what you did,

27:16.002 --> 27:18.037
but the commander and
I have a job to do,

27:18.070 --> 27:19.772
and we need you to
answer a few questions.

27:19.806 --> 27:21.173
We need you
to be honest.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.374
You understand?

27:22.408 --> 27:24.443
Young lady,

27:24.476 --> 27:25.845
look at me.

27:27.914 --> 27:29.716
You know what this is?

27:31.383 --> 27:33.252
Is it a weapon?

27:36.022 --> 27:37.389
Leah.

27:38.290 --> 27:40.592
No more lies
now, okay?

27:40.626 --> 27:41.894
What's in there?

27:41.928 --> 27:43.863
Why does Mira want it?

27:47.867 --> 27:49.168
I don't know.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.937
Mira didn't say.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.205
She just told me to
get it, so I did.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.274
Leah, why?

27:55.307 --> 27:56.943
Why all the lies?

27:56.976 --> 27:59.011
Because Mira's got my brother.

27:59.045 --> 28:01.047
And she said she
was going to hurt him

28:01.080 --> 28:02.749
if I didn't steal back that box.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.755
I'm telling the truth.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.294
Take her to Pod Zero.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.730
Please!

28:17.764 --> 28:19.866
I have to bring that box
back to Mira,

28:19.899 --> 28:21.333
or she'll hurt my brother.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.102
She'll hurt Sam.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.771
Please!

28:27.907 --> 28:29.976
We're going to detain her
till we figure out

28:30.009 --> 28:32.311
exactly what's going on here.

28:34.814 --> 28:37.383
Fascinating.

28:38.684 --> 28:40.019
Maddy.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.487
Maddy, come and take
a look at this.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.922
That's okay.
I'm good over here.

28:42.955 --> 28:44.767
Well, you can't learn anything
from over there.

28:44.791 --> 28:45.958
Come and look.

28:45.992 --> 28:49.028
It's a vesiculopustular
lesion.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.963
Very common in warm,
humid climate...

28:50.997 --> 28:52.264
No.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.943
Something
on your mind?

29:03.976 --> 29:06.312
What if she's telling the
truth about her brother?

29:06.345 --> 29:09.615
I mean, we... we should
send a few people

29:09.648 --> 29:10.917
to check it out
just in case.

29:10.950 --> 29:15.154
I'm not going to expend
colony resources on a hunch.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.198
Mira might have
planned this, too.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.290
You'd be walking
right into an ambush.

29:18.324 --> 29:21.227
But if there's a kid out
there that's being hurt...

29:21.260 --> 29:22.795
"If."

29:22.829 --> 29:25.832
If I had some proof,
that would be one thing.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.868
I got the word
of a little girl

29:28.901 --> 29:30.236
who managed
to deceive me

29:30.269 --> 29:32.504
and every damn person
in this colony.

29:32.538 --> 29:34.006
I know that,
but, Commander...

29:34.040 --> 29:35.207
The answer is no.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.243
That's an order.

29:38.878 --> 29:41.380
Let it go.

29:43.082 --> 29:45.151
You got a wife, kids.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.319
Go home.

29:58.030 --> 30:00.166
You think Mira would really hurt
her little brother?

30:00.199 --> 30:02.001
There's no way to know if she's

30:02.034 --> 30:03.178
telling the truth
about anything now.

30:03.202 --> 30:05.537
I'm going to go for a walk.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.179
Not such a great day
in the infirmary today.

30:15.281 --> 30:17.583
Did the overachiever
just kind of sort of achieve?

30:17.616 --> 30:19.852
Instead of open-heart surgery,
she could only do

30:19.886 --> 30:21.220
an appendectomy?

30:21.253 --> 30:22.955
Josh.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.823
Stop talking.

30:28.694 --> 30:31.530
At least I get
my room back.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.470
Hey.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.207
Don't beat
yourself up.

30:42.408 --> 30:43.809
Leah let us down.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.444
You did everything right.

30:45.477 --> 30:46.378
I know.
I just thought

30:46.412 --> 30:48.547
I was a better judge of
character, you know?

30:48.580 --> 30:51.250
Well, I thought I was, too.

30:51.283 --> 30:54.987
I don't like people taking
advantage of my family.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.622
Mom, Dad.

30:56.655 --> 30:58.590
Look what Leah left.

31:02.561 --> 31:03.930
"I'm sorry.

31:03.963 --> 31:05.064
I had to."

31:05.097 --> 31:07.266
So she wasn't lying
about her brother.

31:07.299 --> 31:10.502
Which means he really
is in danger.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.938
Yeah.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.377
Maddy.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.046
Hey.
Hey.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.813
Are you doing
anything right now?

31:21.847 --> 31:24.350
Yeah, I'm just
picking up a few things.

31:25.417 --> 31:28.554
Uh, I wanted to talk to
you about something.

31:32.424 --> 31:33.993
I, um...

31:34.026 --> 31:36.128
Thank you.

31:39.798 --> 31:42.969
I want to declare my intentions
for you, Maddy Shannon.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.404
You want to do what to me?

31:50.876 --> 31:52.678
To court you.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.882
Court? You mean, like...
like, date?

31:56.915 --> 31:58.417
Yes.

32:00.086 --> 32:02.021
Why didn't you just say that?

32:02.054 --> 32:04.090
Uh, because that's
not how it's done.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.391
According to the commander,

32:05.424 --> 32:07.326
I have to address you
in a certain way,

32:07.359 --> 32:08.827
and then speak
with your father,

32:08.860 --> 32:10.862
and then call
at your house,

32:10.896 --> 32:12.374
and then have the
honor of escorting you

32:12.398 --> 32:14.066
to a planned
activity or event

32:14.100 --> 32:16.202
outside the home that
might please you.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.705
People used to
do it this way.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.240
Well, technically,

32:21.273 --> 32:22.574
they will do it that way.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.143
You know, in the future.

32:24.176 --> 32:27.946
But then again,
they'll also wear corsets.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.548
So...

32:29.581 --> 32:31.317
may I have the honor?

32:31.350 --> 32:33.385
Yes.

32:33.419 --> 32:35.454
Yes, you may.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.056
Awesome.

32:37.089 --> 32:38.257
Yeah?
Yeah.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.660
'Cause I was just having
the worst day ever.

32:41.693 --> 32:43.929
Well, tell me
about it.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.764
Well, where should I start?

32:45.797 --> 32:46.874
The part
where I almost puked

32:46.898 --> 32:48.934
on a patient
in front of my mother?

32:48.967 --> 32:50.602
Or the part where Leah
just, you know...

32:50.636 --> 32:52.338
Start at the
beginning.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.341
I have time.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.777
Oh, crap.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.896
You're the new cop.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.705
Where am I?

35:39.738 --> 35:41.207
Did Taylor send you?

35:42.974 --> 35:45.076
I came for Leah's brother.

35:45.110 --> 35:47.246
She said you were
gonna hurt him.

35:47.279 --> 35:48.547
And you believed her?

35:48.580 --> 35:51.983
She only lied when she had to.

35:52.017 --> 35:54.052
The boy was never in danger.

35:54.085 --> 35:56.588
I just needed
to motivate her.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.590
To get her to do
what I knew she could.

35:58.624 --> 36:02.228
What's in the box
that's so important?

36:16.074 --> 36:17.976
Right up here
in the canopy, huh?

36:18.009 --> 36:21.647
No wonder Taylor can't find you.

36:21.680 --> 36:24.350
I hear he's taken
quite a shine to you.

36:24.383 --> 36:26.652
Have to say,
I'm surprised,

36:26.685 --> 36:28.520
considering the way you
snuck into his colony.

36:28.554 --> 36:32.524
You sure know a lot about what
goes on inside of Terra Nova.

36:32.558 --> 36:35.861
Almost makes me think, uh...

36:35.894 --> 36:37.629
Ooh, I don't know...

36:37.663 --> 36:39.965
You got yourself a spy
or something.

36:39.998 --> 36:42.968
Maybe I'm psychic.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.404
Maybe.

36:45.437 --> 36:48.574
Maybe you should've had your spy
get the box for you

36:48.607 --> 36:50.476
instead of sending
a little girl.

36:50.509 --> 36:53.312
Or did you not
want to risk

36:53.345 --> 36:55.647
exposing whoever it is?

36:55.681 --> 36:59.050
I can see why Taylor
values you so much.

36:59.084 --> 37:01.853
Oh. Yeah.

37:01.887 --> 37:05.824
Well, that's 'cause
I-I got to save his life once.

37:05.857 --> 37:09.661
It was thanks to you,
as a matter of fact.

37:09.695 --> 37:13.765
You know, in a way,
I'm glad you did.

37:13.799 --> 37:18.136
Carter would've killed him, that
would've made a martyr of him.

37:18.169 --> 37:20.306
Which would only
make my job harder.

37:23.141 --> 37:25.243
And what is your job?

37:30.516 --> 37:34.853
Taylor's pissed off some very
powerful people back in 2149.

37:35.987 --> 37:37.589
They want him gone.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.627
Gone?

37:41.660 --> 37:44.363
If it wasn't for Taylor,
Terra Nova wouldn't have lasted

37:44.396 --> 37:45.997
as long as it has.

37:46.031 --> 37:46.965
If the colony survives...

37:46.998 --> 37:48.543
Everybody knows that.
Oh, come on, Shannon,

37:48.567 --> 37:52.304
don't tell me you believe in
all that "starting over" crap!

37:52.338 --> 37:53.839
That's not what
Terra Nova's about.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.140
Not now, not ever.

37:55.173 --> 37:58.043
Then what's Terra Nova
really about?

38:00.412 --> 38:02.213
You'll see.

38:03.815 --> 38:07.386
But you don't want to be on the
wrong side of history, Shannon.

38:07.419 --> 38:08.820
Be smart.

38:08.854 --> 38:13.492
Do what's right
for your family.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.162
'Cause sooner
or later,

38:17.195 --> 38:19.398
we're going to take Taylor down.

38:21.132 --> 38:24.102
Why?

38:24.135 --> 38:26.472
What does it get you?

38:28.039 --> 38:30.075
It gets me my family.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.712
I have a daughter

38:33.745 --> 38:35.681
back in 2149.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.150
Sienna.

38:39.184 --> 38:43.389
She was four
when I left.

38:43.422 --> 38:47.192
I do my job...

38:47.225 --> 38:49.961
they make sure
I get to see her again.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.566
Who's they?

38:55.934 --> 38:57.669
You're free to go.

39:05.310 --> 39:06.678
Wait.

39:26.231 --> 39:27.466
Leah!

39:27.499 --> 39:29.000
Sam!

39:31.937 --> 39:33.572
It's gonna be okay.

39:37.476 --> 39:39.110
Gonna be okay.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.955
I ought to run you out of town
for disobeying

39:49.988 --> 39:52.658
an order, Shannon.

39:52.691 --> 39:55.060
Yeah, but what the hell.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.863
You reunited a family.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.432
Terra Nova just officially
grew by two.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.968
How'd you make it
out of there with the boy?

40:03.001 --> 40:04.936
Uh, Mira let us go.

40:04.970 --> 40:07.238
Now, that doesn't
sound like Mira.

40:07.272 --> 40:08.607
Doesn't sound
like her at all.

40:08.640 --> 40:11.276
I think she was trying
to prove something.

40:11.309 --> 40:14.513
Like maybe the Sixers
aren't so bad.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.748
Were you convinced?

40:16.782 --> 40:21.687
I might've been, if they
hadn't have busted up my ribs.

40:25.891 --> 40:28.159
She say anything
I should know about?

40:33.431 --> 40:35.901
Well, she's not
a fan of yours.

40:35.934 --> 40:39.137
I meant something
I don't already know.

40:44.710 --> 40:47.813
I sure as hell would like
to know what's in that box

40:47.846 --> 40:49.314
she sent the kid here to steal.

40:49.347 --> 40:51.349
No luck getting it open, huh?

40:51.382 --> 40:54.753
Go get yourself bandaged up.

40:54.786 --> 40:57.155
Let your wife know
you ain't dead.

41:03.962 --> 41:07.766
Oh, if I had a Terra
for every time

41:07.799 --> 41:10.068
I've had to put you
back together...

41:10.101 --> 41:12.003
You're making me
sound like Humpty Dumpty.

41:14.105 --> 41:17.275
You know, I married
a doctor for a reason.

41:17.308 --> 41:20.145
Hey. You did good.

41:20.178 --> 41:21.178
Yeah?

41:22.347 --> 41:24.850
Sorry. Sorry.

41:26.718 --> 41:29.420
You know, Leah's going to be
all right because of you.

41:29.454 --> 41:33.792
Well, there's, um, there's
a lady from the Third Pilgrimage

41:33.825 --> 41:36.762
who's interested in
taking Leah on long-term.

41:36.795 --> 41:39.130
Lost her husband
a few years back.

41:39.164 --> 41:42.033
Well, hopefully
there's room for two.

41:44.636 --> 41:46.504
Hey, where's Maddy?

41:47.939 --> 41:51.877
Well, to save her
nerves and her stomach,

41:51.910 --> 41:53.812
I released her from
her apprenticeship.

41:55.313 --> 41:57.683
Yeah, I don't think the
reality of being a doctor

41:57.716 --> 41:59.851
quite lived up to
her romance of it.

42:01.019 --> 42:03.188
More blood and guts
in the real world.

42:05.791 --> 42:07.659
Sorry to say I haven't
the foggiest idea

42:07.693 --> 42:09.595
how to get it open.

42:09.628 --> 42:10.662
Tried everything.

42:10.696 --> 42:12.230
Well, keep trying.

42:12.263 --> 42:13.932
Mira went a long way to get

42:13.965 --> 42:16.935
whatever's inside
the damn thing.

42:16.968 --> 42:20.338
Sooner or later,
she'll make another play.

42:20.371 --> 42:22.273
Keep it safe.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.356
Hey.

42:38.389 --> 42:41.627
Someone wants to talk with you.

42:49.835 --> 42:52.403
You know what I heard?

42:52.437 --> 42:54.005
I heard the lady

42:54.039 --> 42:56.017
that you're going to be
staying with is super nice.

42:56.041 --> 42:57.643
So use your...

42:59.444 --> 43:01.847
Thank you.
