00:09.620 --> 00:11.580
Breakfast is ready!

00:11.580 --> 00:12.620
-Yes!
-I'm starvin'!

00:12.620 --> 00:13.670
Me too!

00:13.670 --> 00:15.380
Good! 'Cause I made pancakes!

00:15.380 --> 00:16.420
-I'm good.
-Kinda full.

00:16.420 --> 00:17.540
Had a big dinner.

00:19.580 --> 00:22.380
Sit down. Chelsea worked
really hard on these.

00:22.380 --> 00:23.710
Yeah, I can't wait for you
to try 'em.

00:23.710 --> 00:26.500
I can't wait to see if I can
swallow 'em without tastin' 'em.

00:28.540 --> 00:31.380
I think you guys
are really gonna like them.

00:36.420 --> 00:38.620
Gee, Mom, these taste
just like yours.

00:38.620 --> 00:41.460
-Maybe even better.
-Don't push it, Chels.

00:43.540 --> 00:46.620
Since I moved in here,
I actually like food again.

00:49.460 --> 00:52.540
Wait a minute.
I see what's goin' on here.

00:52.540 --> 00:54.540
You do?

00:54.540 --> 00:58.500
You don't have to steal pancakes from
the kids, Rae. I made plenty, here.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.330
-No, I'm good. I'm good.
-Open wide. Hey.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.670
-Chel, I don't want to.
-What?

01:03.250 --> 01:04.420
Why aren't you eatin'
my pancake?

01:04.420 --> 01:05.540
Well, it's just--

01:07.620 --> 01:09.210
Good. Right?

02:19.420 --> 02:21.710
Uh, Booker, I think you have
too many dishes in there.

02:21.710 --> 02:24.460
You've never loaded a dishwasher
in your life.

02:24.460 --> 02:26.500
How do you know?

02:26.500 --> 02:28.620
Because you can't close it.

02:28.620 --> 02:32.330
It'll close. Never
doubt the man.

02:39.710 --> 02:42.420
Who closed it?
The man.

02:42.420 --> 02:44.380
Now the man's gonna go watch
cartoons.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.580
(clicks, humming)

02:46.580 --> 02:48.460
(dishes rattling)

02:48.460 --> 02:50.380
-What's happening?
-(grinding)

02:50.380 --> 02:52.540
I think the man just broke
the dishwasher.

02:54.290 --> 02:55.580
Guys, calm down.

02:55.580 --> 02:57.290
All right? It's not broken.

02:57.290 --> 02:58.500
(thumping)

02:58.500 --> 02:59.670
(hisses)

03:02.460 --> 03:03.580
Yeah, that's broken.

03:06.330 --> 03:08.710
Hey, Rae! Uh, listen, the, uh,
toilet won't stop running.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.460
Oh, did you do that trick
with the handle?

03:10.460 --> 03:12.670
The jiggle, jiggle, stop,
jiggle, jiggle, stop...

03:12.670 --> 03:14.460
jiggle, jiggle?

03:14.460 --> 03:15.580
Yeah. No, I did,

03:15.580 --> 03:17.540
then it, uh,
jiggle, jiggle, broke.

03:18.620 --> 03:20.250
I don't have time for this.

03:20.250 --> 03:21.710
-I have to get to work.
-Wait. On a Saturday?

03:21.710 --> 03:24.420
Yeah. My bossed called me
and said that one of our clients

03:24.420 --> 03:25.620
is having a fashion emergency.

03:25.620 --> 03:27.380
That's okay, I'll just
call the landlord.

03:27.380 --> 03:29.250
-No! Don't do that.
-What?

03:29.250 --> 03:30.380
No, don't do that,
don't do that.

03:30.380 --> 03:31.380
Just flush with the pliers
that we use

03:31.380 --> 03:32.170
to turn on the hallway light.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.710
Wait. Aren't these the pliers
that we use to open the closet?

03:34.710 --> 03:37.210
No, no, those are the pliers
that we use to turn on the oven.

03:38.330 --> 03:39.580
Yeah. Rae, I think
we have a problem.

03:39.580 --> 03:41.580
You're right. I need
to buy more pliers.

03:42.620 --> 03:44.420
Why can't we just
call the landlord?

03:48.250 --> 03:52.420
-Who are you? -Who am I? I live here!
Who are you?

03:55.330 --> 03:57.210
Oh no, Chels, I just had a
vision that the landlord

03:57.210 --> 03:58.290
saw you in our apartment.

03:58.290 --> 03:59.620
Why can't the landlord see me?

03:59.620 --> 04:01.290
(high-pitched) Well...

04:03.250 --> 04:06.290
Uh-oh, Rae. Listen, we've
been besties for a long time,

04:06.290 --> 04:08.620
and if there's one thing I know,
it's that the higher your voice,

04:08.620 --> 04:10.250
the guiltier you are.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.210
(very high-pitched)
Wha-aat?

04:13.210 --> 04:15.330
Rae-Rae, what'd you do?

04:15.330 --> 04:17.620
I never told Jablonski
that you and Levi moved in,

04:17.620 --> 04:20.580
and it says on our lease that it can
only be one family per apartment.

04:20.580 --> 04:22.330
Just keep it a secret
until I talk to him.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.380
Don't worry, Rae.
I'm as good at keepin' secrets

04:24.380 --> 04:26.710
as I am at makin' pancakes.

04:26.710 --> 04:28.250
Go to your room.

04:31.580 --> 04:33.670
Ah! I found the problem.

04:33.670 --> 04:35.380
It's this thing in my hands.

04:35.380 --> 04:37.540
-What's wrong with it?
-It should not be in my hands.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.670
-Hey, guys.
-Nothing!

04:44.330 --> 04:45.540
Nia, what's goin' on?

04:47.290 --> 04:49.330
It's the dishwasher. It...

04:50.460 --> 04:53.290
just started making
this weird noise.

04:53.290 --> 04:55.290
Well, I'll put it on my list
of things to fix

04:55.290 --> 04:57.290
when I get home.

04:57.290 --> 05:01.290
Are you really gonna fix it,
or just clamp pliers on it?

05:03.330 --> 05:04.670
I gotta work on a Saturday.

05:04.670 --> 05:06.420
My house is fallin' apart.

05:06.420 --> 05:09.500
You really tryin' to poke
this bear right now, Levi?

05:09.500 --> 05:11.380
Nope. I'm good.

05:12.710 --> 05:16.380
All I ask is that you do not
call the landlord, please.

05:16.380 --> 05:19.330
I do not want Mr. Jablonski in
this apartment while I'm gone.

05:19.330 --> 05:21.710
For now, just use
the other dishwasher.

05:21.710 --> 05:23.460
-What other dishwasher?
-You!

05:31.330 --> 05:33.460
Raven, thank goodness
you're here.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.710
I really didn't wanna
call you in on a Saturday,

05:35.710 --> 05:39.250
which is why I had
my assistant do it.

05:39.250 --> 05:41.670
Crafty. Didn't think about
blocking Jessica's number.

05:44.210 --> 05:46.540
We have
a Mitzi Vandermark situation.

05:46.540 --> 05:49.380
Wait a second. When I left
yesterday, everybody was happy.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.290
Those capri pants I made
were perfect.

05:51.290 --> 05:52.710
Well, today she tried them on
and freaked.

05:52.710 --> 05:54.670
She was so upset
she peed on the floor.

05:54.670 --> 05:56.580
-What?
-(dog whimpers)

06:00.620 --> 06:01.710
What are we gonna do?

06:01.710 --> 06:03.670
Her owner's gonna be back
any minute.

06:03.670 --> 06:06.290
Don't worry about this.
I got it, I got it, hold on.

06:06.290 --> 06:09.210
Yeah, that's easy, that's easy, I'm gonna
lower the hemline, taper the waist,

06:09.210 --> 06:11.290
and then give her booty
a good 20-minute scratch.

06:11.290 --> 06:12.540
Are you talking about Mitzi
or the owner?

06:12.540 --> 06:13.670
Whatever gets me
outta here sooner.

06:15.330 --> 06:17.460
I just had a genius idea:

06:17.460 --> 06:21.380
Let's spell Mitzi's name
in jewels on her booty.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.540
Uh, I don't like it.
I don't like it.

06:23.540 --> 06:25.540
Well, I love it,
and we're doing it.

06:25.540 --> 06:28.290
-Okay. -This is so fun.
It doesn't even feel like

06:28.290 --> 06:30.540
-we're working on a Saturday.
-(both laugh)

06:30.540 --> 06:32.500
(mockingly)
Yes, it does.

06:37.460 --> 06:39.580
Finally! Last one.

06:41.710 --> 06:44.290
Booker!
You didn't wash the bottom.

06:44.290 --> 06:45.580
We don't eat off the bottom.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.540
I don't wanna do this anymore.

06:48.540 --> 06:50.620
Why can't we just
call Jablonski?

06:50.620 --> 06:52.420
Mom said not to.

06:52.420 --> 06:55.500
She's at work.
She'll never know he was here.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.670
Or we can keep washing dishes.

06:57.670 --> 07:00.210
By hand. Forever.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.670
Give me the phone.

07:03.670 --> 07:07.500
Levi, go in the hallway and keep watch
just in case Mom comes home early.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.380
And no messing around.

07:09.380 --> 07:10.420
Gotta really pay attention.

07:10.420 --> 07:12.290
But won't I look suspicious?

07:12.290 --> 07:14.330
I should probably
have a cover.

07:14.330 --> 07:15.580
I could bring my drone.

07:15.580 --> 07:17.380
Hey, you know,
that's some good thinkin', yeah.

07:17.380 --> 07:19.460
And make it look like
you're really havin' fun.

07:19.460 --> 07:23.540
Okay, but I'm only doin' it for you, not
because it's what I wanted to do anyway.

07:26.330 --> 07:28.420
-He just played me, didn't he?
-(door opens)

07:28.420 --> 07:30.380
Like a curly-haired piano.

07:38.420 --> 07:43.380
Just a boy playin' with his drone. Keep
movin'. Nothin' to see here. Come on.

07:53.380 --> 07:56.290
What the heck, Tess?
Why'd you hit my drone?

07:56.290 --> 07:57.420
'Cause I had a bat.

07:58.620 --> 08:02.330
And because you have a bat,
I won't ask any more questions.

08:04.620 --> 08:07.580
Man, now I gotta go
find my drone.

08:07.580 --> 08:10.250
Quit your crying.
I'll help ya.

08:10.250 --> 08:11.540
-You don't have to.
-Eh.

08:11.540 --> 08:13.540
It's either that
or help my mom

08:13.540 --> 08:15.330
get rid of the fleas
in our apartment.

08:15.330 --> 08:17.250
How you get to have fleas
in your apartment?

08:17.250 --> 08:19.250
How am I supposed to know?

08:23.620 --> 08:26.290
There we go!
Dishwasher's all fixed.

08:26.290 --> 08:28.620
-Thanks! -"Thanks"? That's it?

08:28.620 --> 08:31.460
The absolute bare minimum
of gratitude?

08:31.460 --> 08:33.500
Oh, yeah, I don't deserve
more than that.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.670
I'm just Phil Jablonski.
I don't have feelings.

08:39.330 --> 08:40.500
Thanks a lot?

08:40.500 --> 08:42.710
Now it's meaningless.
You made me beg for it.

08:45.420 --> 08:47.670
Hey! Hey, who put the
chain on this door?

08:50.380 --> 08:53.290
Mom's home! Okay, you distract
her, I'll hide Jablonski,

08:53.290 --> 08:54.580
and when she's not looking,
I'll sneak him out.

08:54.580 --> 08:55.250
Right. Okay. Okay.

08:58.540 --> 09:01.620
Uh, Mr. Jablonski? While you're
here, would you mind taking a look

09:01.620 --> 09:03.540
at our leaky shower head?

09:03.540 --> 09:05.670
Oh, sure. Not like I got
nothin' else to do.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.500
I mean, I don't, but it's
the assumption that hurts.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.620
Hold on, hold on,
gotta close it to open it.

09:11.620 --> 09:13.460
That's how the chain works.

09:16.460 --> 09:18.380
(laughs) You know how
the chain works.

09:19.620 --> 09:22.290
Yeah, I know
how the chain work.

09:25.330 --> 09:27.750
Mom, I'm glad you're home.
There's a spider in the kitchen,

09:27.750 --> 09:29.290
I need you to kill it.

09:29.290 --> 09:31.250
What's the matter,
your sister not around?

09:31.250 --> 09:34.330
(laughs)

09:36.380 --> 09:39.420
Yep, that was savage, Mom.
Cold-blooded.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.620
-Mom's in the kitchen. -Perfect. I'll
get Jablonski out of the bathroom,

09:45.620 --> 09:47.670
and Mom will never know
he was here.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.380
(Chelsea screams)

09:50.420 --> 09:51.460
What was that?

09:54.670 --> 09:56.250
Who are you?

09:56.250 --> 09:59.500
Wh-- who am I?
I live here! Who are you?

09:59.500 --> 10:01.620
Mr. Jablonski?

10:01.620 --> 10:03.460
Gosh, that name
sounds really familiar.

10:03.460 --> 10:04.670
Hey, Rae, what's the name
of that landlord

10:04.670 --> 10:06.500
I'm not supposed to tell
I live here?

10:06.500 --> 10:07.540
Both:
Jablonski.

10:09.670 --> 10:11.420
Yep. That's it.

10:16.540 --> 10:19.210
Mr. Jablonski, I swear
I was gonna tell you

10:19.210 --> 10:20.380
about Chelsea and Levi
moving in.

10:20.380 --> 10:22.670
-When? -You know, today,
around this time.

10:24.460 --> 10:26.620
Your lease says one family
per apartment.

10:26.620 --> 10:29.380
An extra family'll cost you
an extra thousand bucks a month.

10:29.380 --> 10:31.540
What? That's ridiculous.
We can't afford that.

10:31.540 --> 10:34.290
Listen, you broke the rules.
Come up with the money,

10:34.290 --> 10:35.500
or you're all out
by the end of the month.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.540
What?

10:38.710 --> 10:41.290
Is that really gonna happen?

10:41.290 --> 10:42.580
He can't just kick us out,
can he?

10:42.580 --> 10:43.620
Nobody's getting kicked out.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.540
Nobody. Don't worry
about it, all right?

10:45.540 --> 10:47.420
Just let me and Aunt Chels
talk this out.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.580
(sighs)

10:52.580 --> 10:53.620
Ooh.

10:55.290 --> 10:56.620
So, what'd you wanna
talk about?

10:58.620 --> 10:59.620
Really?

11:01.250 --> 11:03.620
I don't know. I don't know!
Rae, I'm freakin' out!

11:03.620 --> 11:06.460
I don't wanna leave.
Levi's so happy.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.500
I'm happy.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.380
It's like for the first time
since my divorce,

11:10.380 --> 11:12.380
I actually felt like things
were gonna be okay.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.620
They will be. They will, Chels.
Don't worry about it.

11:14.620 --> 11:16.380
We're gonna
figure this out, right?

11:16.380 --> 11:19.290
We gotta-- we gotta find a way
to make an extra $1,000 a month.

11:20.670 --> 11:22.540
Oh, I got it.

11:22.540 --> 11:26.460
Every day at 4:30 an armored
truck stops outside the building

11:26.460 --> 11:29.710
across the street. One guard
goes outside while the other one

11:29.710 --> 11:34.540
stays in the car. I'm thinkin'...
today, when the first guy leaves,

11:34.540 --> 11:39.380
I'll creep up on the second guy,
and ask them if they're hiring.

11:40.540 --> 11:42.330
Right?

11:42.330 --> 11:43.540
Or...

11:44.620 --> 11:47.620
I'll just go back to work
and ask my boss for a raise.

11:47.620 --> 11:49.540
Okay. All right,
but if that doesn't work,

11:49.540 --> 11:52.380
you gotta text me by 4:15,
so I can get in position.

11:53.540 --> 11:54.670
And print out a resume.

12:02.380 --> 12:04.330
This came off my drone.

12:06.380 --> 12:07.620
Maybe it flew in that apartment.

12:07.620 --> 12:10.540
Hold up! I know everybody
in this building,

12:10.540 --> 12:13.670
and the lady who lives
in there is a witch.

12:13.670 --> 12:15.500
A witch?
Are you joking?

12:15.500 --> 12:18.540
Listen up, fun size. There's
two things I don't joke about,

12:18.540 --> 12:20.460
and one of them's witches.

12:20.460 --> 12:21.540
What's the other thing?

12:21.540 --> 12:23.670
Who cares, yo?
We're talkin' about witches!

12:25.380 --> 12:27.290
I have to get my drone.

12:27.290 --> 12:28.500
I'm going in.

12:41.580 --> 12:43.330
Aaaaah!

12:43.330 --> 12:45.380
Tess, what are you doing?

12:45.380 --> 12:48.420
I came in here to keep you from being
witched like all these other kids.

12:50.330 --> 12:52.580
They're not kids.
They're dolls.

12:52.580 --> 12:54.580
Oh, yeah?

12:54.580 --> 12:57.500
Well, then why does this one look
like Mike Applebaum from 3F?

12:58.750 --> 13:01.580
Yo Mike, they told us
you moved to St. Louis.

13:03.330 --> 13:05.460
Tess, you can go if you want,

13:05.460 --> 13:07.540
but I'm not leaving
without my drone.

13:07.540 --> 13:09.540
What's the big deal
with that thing, anyway?

13:09.540 --> 13:13.670
It was the last thing my dad
got me before he went to jail.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.250
I'm sorry, Levi.

13:17.420 --> 13:18.670
Don't worry,
we'll find it.

13:18.670 --> 13:20.670
-(lamp clicks)
-Who are you?

13:20.670 --> 13:24.750
Both:
(screaming) Witch!

13:28.290 --> 13:30.330
Paisley? Are you here?

13:31.620 --> 13:33.620
(whimpering)

13:33.620 --> 13:37.330
Oh, come on! If you're gonna
put Mitzi's name on the pants,

13:37.330 --> 13:38.460
at least sew it right!

13:42.210 --> 13:44.330
Paisley: Jessica, call
Mitzi's owner and tell her

13:44.330 --> 13:45.620
the pants are ready.

13:51.380 --> 13:54.210
(gasps)
What happened?

13:55.580 --> 13:57.380
Quick!
Call Raven!

13:57.380 --> 13:59.330
She's the only one
who can fix this.

14:00.620 --> 14:05.380
(phone ringing)

14:10.540 --> 14:11.710
What are you doing?

14:11.710 --> 14:13.580
I was-- I was looking for
the perpetrator who, uh--

14:13.580 --> 14:16.290
who, uh--
who jacked up Mitzi's pants.

14:16.290 --> 14:18.670
And I-- I thought they was behind
the curtain, but they weren't.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.330
Please tell me
you can fix them.

14:23.330 --> 14:26.290
Oh, of course,
of course I can fix them.

14:26.290 --> 14:27.620
You're a life saver.

14:27.620 --> 14:30.290
I literally don't know
what I would do without you.

14:30.290 --> 14:33.580
Oh, I am so glad you said that,
'cause I need to ask you something.

14:33.580 --> 14:36.670
Raven, you can ask me
anything, literally.

14:36.670 --> 14:39.290
If there is anything
you need, just ask.

14:39.290 --> 14:40.710
I would literally
do anything for you.

14:40.710 --> 14:42.290
I need a raise.

14:42.290 --> 14:43.670
I literally cannot do that.

14:45.620 --> 14:47.710
Now that my dog is engaged
to the mayor's dog,

14:47.710 --> 14:50.420
I have to pay
for a really fancy wedding.

14:50.420 --> 14:53.460
So you can't give me a raise
'cause your dog's getting married?

14:53.460 --> 14:55.250
I knew you'd understand.

14:56.290 --> 14:58.540
No, I don't.
I literally don't.

15:06.620 --> 15:09.460
Booker... I have an idea
on how we can make money.

15:09.460 --> 15:12.620
We can sell some of our stuff,
like... in a yard sale.

15:12.620 --> 15:17.580
Nia, there's no way we're gonna raise
$1,000 selling our dumb stuff.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.540
We can't just sit around.

15:20.540 --> 15:23.710
This is our fault.
It could split our family up.

15:23.710 --> 15:25.620
You don't think I know that?

15:25.620 --> 15:28.460
Now that I have a brother, I
finally know the joy you've had

15:28.460 --> 15:30.250
for the last 11 years.

15:32.330 --> 15:33.670
What are we gonna do?

15:36.460 --> 15:39.250
You did it!
You saved the apartment!

15:42.620 --> 15:45.420
Nia! I just had another
one of those things

15:45.420 --> 15:47.290
where I saw what was gonna
happen before it happens!

15:47.290 --> 15:50.500
-A vision? -Yeah, sure, let's
call it that from now on.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.500
In this one,
I saved the apartment!

15:52.500 --> 15:54.330
That's amazing! How?

15:54.330 --> 15:55.380
Was it the yard sale?

15:55.380 --> 15:58.380
That or I finally got
that male modeling contract.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.500
Yard sale it is!

16:04.250 --> 16:05.620
You're gonna love
Robie the Robot.

16:05.620 --> 16:08.250
He's a radio, a flashlight,

16:08.250 --> 16:11.620
and if you push this button,
sometimes, not every time...

16:11.620 --> 16:13.380
he swears.

16:17.250 --> 16:20.460
From one Easy-Make baker
to another, a 25-watt bulb

16:20.460 --> 16:22.420
is the secret to a moist cake.

16:22.420 --> 16:24.500
All right.
You enjoy yourself, Terry.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.540
-How much did you make?
-One hundred and forty.

16:29.540 --> 16:34.460
So unless you made $860,
then we're in trouble.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.500
We're in trouble.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.210
I can't believe Paisley
wouldn't give me a raise.

16:44.210 --> 16:45.380
I've been workin' here
for three years,

16:45.380 --> 16:46.620
and all
she can say to me was,

16:46.620 --> 16:50.500
(mimics Paisley) "Raven, can you
please re-bling this bulldog's booty?"

16:52.290 --> 16:55.670
I called the bank and tried cleaning
out my savings, but apparently,

16:55.670 --> 16:57.620
you can only do that once!

16:59.420 --> 17:01.460
I don't know what we're gonna do,
Chels, I'm all out of ideas.

17:01.460 --> 17:03.670
I mean, how are we gonna
get a thousand dollars?

17:03.670 --> 17:06.580
Rae, listen, we have been
through so much together.

17:06.580 --> 17:12.620
You know, high school? Divorce? That
summer we spent crewin' that oil rig?

17:16.250 --> 17:17.500
We can't give up.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.210
You're right.

17:20.210 --> 17:21.620
-I'll be home soon.
-Okay.

17:21.620 --> 17:23.210
(knock on door)

17:26.290 --> 17:29.580
Mr. Jablonski,
thanks for comin'.

17:29.580 --> 17:33.540
This is weird, right? I jack up your
rent, you invite me over for coffee.

17:33.540 --> 17:38.670
I gotta tell ya, my, uh, landlord
senses are tingling here.

17:38.670 --> 17:42.670
(laughing)

17:42.670 --> 17:46.750
No. No, no, no, I just thought if we
talked over maybe a cup of coffee,

17:46.750 --> 17:49.500
we could, uh, come to some
sort of understanding.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.500
(laughs)

17:51.710 --> 17:53.460
(spitting)

17:54.460 --> 17:56.420
Oh!
This is awful!

17:57.500 --> 17:59.380
Wait. You tryin'
to poison me?

17:59.380 --> 18:01.380
Poison you?
Why would I do that?

18:01.380 --> 18:03.290
To stop me
from throwin' you out.

18:03.290 --> 18:07.210
Well, this isn't the first time a tenant's
tried to poison old Phil Jablonski.

18:09.290 --> 18:10.460
I'm callin' the cops.

18:10.460 --> 18:11.670
-Well, careful, don't slip on the...
-Whoa!

18:11.670 --> 18:12.670
-(gasp)
-(thud)

18:14.540 --> 18:16.710
...coffee!

18:16.710 --> 18:21.420
Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry, I-- I
should've said that faster.

18:25.380 --> 18:28.290
Tess:
Lady, you're killin' me!

18:28.290 --> 18:31.460
With all that delicious cake!

18:31.460 --> 18:33.420
It was really nice
to meet you, Myrna.

18:33.420 --> 18:36.580
Thanks for being so understanding
about the breaking and entering.

18:38.540 --> 18:40.710
And for not turning us
into dolls.

18:40.710 --> 18:43.250
Please!
Where would I put you?

18:44.580 --> 18:47.670
Come back soon. We can look through
the rest of my family albums!

18:47.670 --> 18:50.380
Can't wait.

18:50.380 --> 18:53.500
Now that lady had way too many
pictures of her son, right?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.620
Made her doll collection
look downright reasonable.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.290
(laughs)

19:03.290 --> 19:05.620
Chels! Kids!

19:06.710 --> 19:08.250
Mom?

19:09.580 --> 19:11.420
This is for you.

19:11.420 --> 19:12.750
We sold a bunch
of our stuff.

19:12.750 --> 19:16.290
It's not enough for the rent,
but we want you to have it.

19:17.580 --> 19:19.500
You did not have to do this.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.420
I told you, Chels and I
were gonna take care of it.

19:21.420 --> 19:24.540
I know.
But we wanted to help.

19:26.620 --> 19:29.290
(Nia giggles)

19:29.290 --> 19:32.580
You guys are never gonna
believe where I just was.

19:34.540 --> 19:37.290
-Mmm! -Why is there a
dude in the closet?

19:37.290 --> 19:40.580
Mmm! Mmm!
Mmm! Mmmmmm!

19:40.580 --> 19:43.420
-(gasps) Mr. Jablonski?
-Mmm! Mmm! Mm!

19:43.420 --> 19:45.620
What is going on here?

19:45.620 --> 19:47.290
(knock on door)

19:47.290 --> 19:49.580
Hey, Levi, you forgot your toy.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.670
(noises through gag)

19:51.670 --> 19:53.420
-Phil?
-Mmm!

19:53.420 --> 19:55.670
-You know him?
-He's my son!

19:55.670 --> 19:58.330
The witch from 2A
is your mama?

20:00.620 --> 20:03.500
Oh! Well, I see you found
Mr. Jablonski.

20:04.540 --> 20:07.460
-Mm! -Why have you got
my Philly all tied up?

20:07.460 --> 20:09.620
Yeah, why do you have
her Philly all tied up?

20:09.620 --> 20:13.460
I panicked! Okay? God, he ac--
accused me of trying to poison him.

20:13.460 --> 20:16.710
-Why would he think that? -I don't know,
I just-- I just made him cup of coffee.

20:16.710 --> 20:19.460
Trio:
Oh...

20:20.670 --> 20:24.710
(coughs) Ma, these people are crazy.
I want ya outta here.

20:24.710 --> 20:29.460
Mr. Jablonski, please!
Please, don't blame them.

20:29.460 --> 20:30.750
My son and I will move out.

20:30.750 --> 20:32.460
-That'll work!
-Wait. No, no, no,

20:32.460 --> 20:33.500
if they're going,
we're going.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.540
That works, too!

20:35.670 --> 20:37.750
I'm sorry. None of this
would be happening

20:37.750 --> 20:39.540
if I hadn't've called Jablonski.

20:39.540 --> 20:41.290
I should've just listened
to you.

20:41.290 --> 20:43.330
But you only called him
'cause I broke the dishwasher.

20:43.330 --> 20:45.670
Stop it, you two, stop it.

20:45.670 --> 20:47.460
This is not on you.
It's on me.

20:47.460 --> 20:50.540
All right?
Mr. Jablonski?

20:50.540 --> 20:54.420
I should've told you that I
had another family move in,

20:54.420 --> 20:56.580
but you have to understand,
this is my best friend.

20:56.580 --> 21:00.330
And she was struggling. And honestly,
so was I, I mean, we got kids,

21:00.330 --> 21:02.330
we got bills.

21:02.330 --> 21:03.620
It's hard.

21:03.620 --> 21:06.540
And yes, we might be two families
living in one apartment, but...

21:08.620 --> 21:10.250
You know what?
It's okay.

21:10.250 --> 21:11.580
We'll get outta your hair.

21:11.580 --> 21:12.670
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

21:14.670 --> 21:18.710
Sorry, Myrna. Looks like we won't be
able to play mah-jongg next Tuesday.

21:18.710 --> 21:22.380
Oh, don't cancel
on me yet, honey.

21:22.380 --> 21:24.540
I know what's it's like
to try and raise kids alone.

21:24.540 --> 21:29.460
I wish I had a best friend helpin' me out
when I was raisin' this knucklehead.

21:30.460 --> 21:31.540
Ma, what are you sayin'?

21:31.540 --> 21:33.330
Nobody's goin' anywhere!

21:33.330 --> 21:34.540
But they're two families!

21:34.540 --> 21:36.380
I only see one.

21:37.620 --> 21:39.500
And I'm not letting you
throw them out!

21:39.500 --> 21:42.250
-(whispers) Or raise the rent.
-Or raise the rent!

21:43.290 --> 21:44.710
But, Ma, I'm the landlord.

21:44.710 --> 21:46.500
And I own the building!

21:46.500 --> 21:50.290
How cool is this? Jablonski's
getting yelled at by his mom!

21:51.500 --> 21:54.750
Come on, Phil. We've bothered
these nice people long enough.

21:54.750 --> 21:58.420
Oh, Levi, are we still on
for mah-jongg?

21:58.420 --> 22:01.420
-Only if you don't mind losing.
-Oh, we'll see.

22:03.750 --> 22:07.380
Wow, Levi! Good thing you
made friends with Myrna.

22:08.500 --> 22:11.620
She's right. You did it!
You saved the apartment!

22:15.460 --> 22:17.380
That was my vision!

22:17.380 --> 22:19.540
I know, but...
Levi saved the day, not us.

22:19.540 --> 22:21.540
And he's gettin'
my smooches!

22:21.540 --> 22:24.540
Hey! Now everybody is gettin' smooches.
Come here.

22:24.540 --> 22:26.460
(giggles)
Smooches!

22:35.460 --> 22:37.580
Here's Philly when he was three.

22:37.580 --> 22:38.710
Oh, and here he is in the tub!

22:38.710 --> 22:40.670
Both:
Aww.

22:40.670 --> 22:43.250
You guys, I have a picture of the
twins just like it, check it out.

22:43.250 --> 22:45.500
Both:
Aww.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.670
Yeah, Levi never liked baths.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.210
This is him in the shower.

22:49.210 --> 22:51.420
Both:
Aww.

22:51.420 --> 22:53.380
This is so humiliating.

22:53.380 --> 22:54.420
The worst.

22:54.420 --> 22:56.460
What is it with moms
and bath pictures?

22:58.380 --> 23:00.460
I get it. I got a
pretty cute tushie.

23:01.620 --> 23:04.380
Oh, and here's Philly
with a perm.

23:04.380 --> 23:05.540
You had hair?

23:05.540 --> 23:07.620
Sorry, man we gotta see this.

23:09.710 --> 23:13.290
All:
Aww!
