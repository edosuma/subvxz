01:06.549 --> 01:10.149
<i>Coney Island, 1950s.</i>

01:10.151 --> 01:13.487
<i>The beach, the boardwalk.</i>

01:13.489 --> 01:16.824
<i>Once a luminous jewel, but
growing relentlessly seedier</i>

01:16.826 --> 01:19.892
<i>as the tides roll in and out.</i>

01:19.894 --> 01:22.996
<i>Summers, I work here
on Bay Seven.</i>

01:22.998 --> 01:25.732
<i>Comes the fall, I'm a student
at New York University,</i>

01:25.734 --> 01:28.669
<i>going for my master's
in European Drama.</i>

01:28.671 --> 01:31.771
<i>I'm Mickey Ruben.
Poetic by nature.</i>

01:31.773 --> 01:33.973
<i>I harbor dreams
of being a writer,</i>

01:33.975 --> 01:36.276
<i>a writer of truly great plays,</i>

01:36.278 --> 01:39.079
<i>so I can one day
surprise everyone</i>

01:39.081 --> 01:42.449
<i>and turn out
a profound masterpiece.</i>

01:42.451 --> 01:43.616
<i>Anyhow...</i>

01:43.618 --> 01:45.151
...let me get to the story.

01:45.153 --> 01:47.386
In which I am a character,
so be warned,

01:47.388 --> 01:49.323
as a poet, I use symbols,

01:49.325 --> 01:51.091
and as a budding dramatist,

01:51.093 --> 01:55.729
I relish melodrama
and larger-than-life characters.

01:55.731 --> 01:58.130
<i>Enter Carolina.</i>

02:15.684 --> 02:19.385
Okay, have fun.
Yep.

02:19.387 --> 02:20.921
Excuse me.

02:20.923 --> 02:23.790
Where's Humpty Jablon?
Does he work here?

02:23.792 --> 02:27.794
Uh, Humpty works the carousel,
but today he's working nights.

02:27.796 --> 02:29.762
Do you know
where he lives?

02:29.764 --> 02:32.633
Um, ah, it's around here.

02:32.635 --> 02:35.268
- You can ask Ginny.
- Ginny?

02:35.270 --> 02:36.869
Yeah, his... his wife.

02:36.871 --> 02:39.473
Um, she works
at Ruby's Clam House.

02:39.475 --> 02:42.909
Uh, you just keep
going down that way there.

02:42.911 --> 02:45.511
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah, you have a good one.

03:17.845 --> 03:22.084
- Hey, Charlie.
- Oh, hey.

03:23.552 --> 03:26.086
Excuse me.
Do you know if Ginny's here?

03:26.088 --> 03:29.522
- Yeah, I'm Ginny.
- I'm Carolina.

03:29.524 --> 03:32.661
- Who?
- Carolina, Humpty's daughter.

03:37.899 --> 03:39.935
Jesus.

03:41.436 --> 03:43.236
Is he gonna be surprised.

03:43.238 --> 03:47.240
I know he's gonna be upset,
but I had to come here.

03:47.242 --> 03:50.643
I didn't want to,
but I don't have a choice.

03:52.915 --> 03:55.918
I'll tell you the truth.

03:56.851 --> 03:59.555
I don't think
he ever expected this.

04:00.422 --> 04:02.655
You're his wife?

04:02.657 --> 04:05.192
Why are you looking at me?

04:05.194 --> 04:08.228
You're much younger
than I would have imagined.

04:08.230 --> 04:09.862
- Really?
- Mm.

04:09.864 --> 04:13.466
Oh, I don't feel
much younger.

04:13.468 --> 04:15.235
I was thinking
of my mother.

04:15.237 --> 04:17.637
When she died,
she was practically...

04:17.640 --> 04:19.605
...all gray.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.341
I look like her.

04:21.343 --> 04:24.944
Humpty should be back
in half an hour.

04:24.946 --> 04:27.514
He went fishing off the pier
at Sheepshead Bay.

04:27.516 --> 04:30.216
I'd always heard that
he moved to New Jersey.

04:30.218 --> 04:33.153
No, we got thrown out
of our place there.

04:33.155 --> 04:34.720
- Oh.
- Well, I'm not telling you

04:34.722 --> 04:37.156
anything new
about your father.

04:37.158 --> 04:41.093
He fell off the wagon
and busted up the lobby.

04:43.165 --> 04:46.066
I guess you're used
to all this noise.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.001
You never
get used to it.

04:48.003 --> 04:52.175
I hate it.
This whole honkytonk fairyland.

04:53.374 --> 04:55.011
We live up here.

05:08.523 --> 05:09.790
Over here, folks!

05:09.792 --> 05:12.725
Place used to house
a freak show.

05:12.727 --> 05:14.961
Humpty had to do
a lot of fixing up.

05:14.963 --> 05:17.530
Oh, God.
I hope when he sees me

05:17.532 --> 05:20.132
- he doesn't fly off the handle.
- No, I don't think it's...

05:20.134 --> 05:23.136
I hope he doesn't throw me out.
I-I don't know what I'll do.

05:23.138 --> 05:24.638
I don't have
a dime to my name.

05:24.640 --> 05:26.840
I literally
don't have ten pennies.

05:26.842 --> 05:29.141
Come on up
and play Skin the Wire.

05:29.143 --> 05:30.610
Hottest game on the boardwalk.

05:30.612 --> 05:33.146
This, this, this goddamn noise.

05:33.148 --> 05:36.016
I tell you.
You never get used to it.

05:36.018 --> 05:38.018
Ugh, my head's throbbing.

05:38.020 --> 05:41.588
And my, my kid, my kid had
some trouble in school today...

05:41.590 --> 05:42.822
You and my father
have a child?

05:42.824 --> 05:44.557
No, from my first husband.

05:44.559 --> 05:46.093
Don't ever have kids.

05:46.095 --> 05:49.261
Now my head's cracking open.

05:49.263 --> 05:51.234
I get migraines.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.667
If you don't like Coney Island,

05:53.669 --> 05:56.039
why don't you move?

05:58.607 --> 06:01.177
From your mouth to God's ears.

06:02.744 --> 06:04.677
Money, honey.

06:04.679 --> 06:07.716
Mazuma.
The wherewithal.

06:08.484 --> 06:11.785
Ginny!
Ginny, big score.

06:11.787 --> 06:16.325
Fluke, flounder,
some, uh, blue claws.

06:21.562 --> 06:23.732
No.

06:24.932 --> 06:27.434
No. What the hell
you doin' here?

06:27.436 --> 06:30.336
I told you never to step foot
in my home again.

06:30.338 --> 06:34.276
I'm in serious trouble.
I couldn't help it.

06:35.042 --> 06:36.713
You let her in here?

06:38.246 --> 06:39.915
Christ!

06:42.850 --> 06:45.088
I don't believe this.

06:47.756 --> 06:49.456
Can you just go?
Come on, go.

06:49.458 --> 06:50.790
I can't.

06:50.792 --> 06:52.858
If they find me,
they're gonna kill me.

06:52.860 --> 06:54.894
You better hear her out, Humpty.

06:54.896 --> 06:56.362
Mind your own business.

06:56.364 --> 06:58.697
I got a bad headache
and Richie did it again.

06:58.699 --> 06:59.932
You were supposed
to talk to him.

06:59.934 --> 07:01.600
I talked to him.

07:01.602 --> 07:03.836
Frank's gonna kill me.

07:03.838 --> 07:05.571
I ran away and I-I took nothing.

07:05.573 --> 07:09.442
I-I have no clothes,
I've been sleeping in the rain,

07:09.444 --> 07:12.646
and I'm marked.
They're gonna kill me.

07:12.648 --> 07:15.314
Well, that's what you get
when you marry a gangster.

07:15.316 --> 07:17.651
Jesus, they're not gonna
come after you here, are they?

07:17.653 --> 07:18.985
I don't like trouble.

07:18.987 --> 07:20.687
Do you hear what I'm saying?

07:20.689 --> 07:23.456
- They're gonna kill me.
- There's a young kid here.

07:23.458 --> 07:25.624
- This is not our problem.
- All right, all right,

07:25.626 --> 07:27.597
all right, knock it off.

07:28.362 --> 07:31.131
- I-I gotta have a drink.
- No, Humpty, you've been good.

07:31.133 --> 07:33.934
I need one.

07:33.936 --> 07:35.768
I need one.
Look what's going on here.

07:35.770 --> 07:39.939
No booze.
I'll make you coffee.

07:39.941 --> 07:42.074
Goddamn it.

07:42.076 --> 07:43.576
What the hell
do you expect to happen

07:43.578 --> 07:45.377
when you marry
a cheap hoodlum?

07:45.379 --> 07:48.814
I was 20.
I didn't know better.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.182
I'm sorry.

07:50.184 --> 07:52.184
Why didn't you
go to the police?

07:52.186 --> 07:54.954
I told the police too much.
That's the problem.

07:54.956 --> 07:56.655
Why the hell
you open your mouth?

07:56.657 --> 07:58.958
The police told me that
I could be looking at five years

07:58.960 --> 08:00.593
if I didn't cooperate.

08:00.595 --> 08:02.528
Well, what the hell do you know?

08:02.530 --> 08:05.497
Since when do you know
what happens inside the rackets?

08:05.499 --> 08:07.634
How could I not know?

08:07.636 --> 08:09.336
You can't be married
to one of those guys

08:09.338 --> 08:11.273
and not pick up
on what's going on.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.141
Jesus Christ!

08:15.143 --> 08:17.543
I told you not to marry
that racketeer!

08:17.545 --> 08:21.016
I told you he was all mobbed up!
He stank of murder!

08:22.049 --> 08:25.752
She found this,
this greaseball exciting!

08:25.754 --> 08:28.688
He wasn't even good lookin'!

08:28.690 --> 08:31.027
He was a punk!

08:33.160 --> 08:35.462
- I need a drink!
- Forget it, Humpty.

08:35.464 --> 08:38.530
I need one, goddamn it!

08:38.532 --> 08:40.698
Calm down.

08:49.845 --> 08:52.013
Jesus Christ.

08:52.980 --> 08:56.348
Goddamn it, she could have
married a few guys from school,

08:56.350 --> 08:57.918
from the neighborhood.
All of 'em.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.156
Decent kids.

09:01.156 --> 09:03.122
We raised her nice.

09:03.124 --> 09:05.090
Your mother and I,

09:05.092 --> 09:08.929
we broke our backs off working
so you could go to college,

09:08.931 --> 09:12.031
and, you know, you didn't.

09:12.033 --> 09:14.733
You threw it all away.

09:14.735 --> 09:17.170
Well, come on,
you're such a beautiful girl.

09:17.172 --> 09:19.539
You...

09:19.541 --> 09:20.873
You had your pick.

09:20.875 --> 09:23.910
I loved Frank, okay?

09:23.912 --> 09:25.377
And all the guys
you handpicked for me,

09:25.379 --> 09:28.781
they were dull, colorless,
boring guys.

09:28.783 --> 09:32.087
All of 'em honest men.
Every one of 'em.

09:33.622 --> 09:35.892
Christ!

09:36.892 --> 09:39.595
Your mother's
last dying request...

09:40.595 --> 09:42.929
...on her deathbed

09:42.931 --> 09:47.169
was that you didn't run off
with that slime Frankie Adato.

09:48.036 --> 09:51.438
You wouldn't give her that one
bit of satisfaction, would you?

09:51.440 --> 09:53.906
You wouldn't let her
die in peace.

09:53.908 --> 09:56.144
I loved him.

09:57.278 --> 10:00.347
I was 20.
I-I wanted more.

10:00.349 --> 10:02.218
"More."

10:02.984 --> 10:04.516
More.
More what?

10:04.518 --> 10:07.353
Oh, Jesus, Humpty.
There's a world out there.

10:07.355 --> 10:09.555
This does not concern you.

10:09.557 --> 10:12.358
All I know is,
you lost your head.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.694
Your head was in the clouds
over that gutter guinea,

10:14.696 --> 10:18.500
that flashy, cheap,
flashy little wop.

10:19.401 --> 10:23.103
You didn't think
I knew he carried a gun up here?

10:23.105 --> 10:24.838
- Huh?
- He'll know...

10:24.840 --> 10:26.271
He'll know you came here.

10:26.273 --> 10:29.041
No, it's the last place
he'll look.

10:29.043 --> 10:31.343
He knows how you feel about me.

10:31.345 --> 10:32.945
Yeah.

10:32.947 --> 10:34.613
You mean he knows

10:34.615 --> 10:37.720
how much you hated me
for calling it the way I saw it.

10:39.454 --> 10:41.190
Christ.

10:42.423 --> 10:45.925
I counted on you when she died.

10:45.927 --> 10:47.930
I was lost.

10:48.964 --> 10:50.729
You dumped me for that trash.

10:50.731 --> 10:53.868
That's why he wouldn't think
I'd come here.

10:54.702 --> 10:57.270
He knows that we haven't
exchanged words in five years,

10:57.272 --> 10:59.372
that the bad blood between us
ran too deep.

10:59.374 --> 11:01.407
If he shows up here,
I'll kill him.

11:01.409 --> 11:03.108
Oh, God,
don't say that.

11:03.110 --> 11:05.178
- I don't, I don't want trouble.
- All right.

11:05.180 --> 11:06.646
Okay, my nerves are shot
as it is...

11:06.648 --> 11:08.147
- Um...
- ...and you better calm down.

11:08.149 --> 11:10.382
All right.

11:10.384 --> 11:13.585
Just don't tell me
what I should or shouldn't do.

11:13.587 --> 11:15.757
She's my daughter.

11:17.526 --> 11:20.629
Christ.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.633
You were a light, baby.

11:26.368 --> 11:28.771
You were a light in my life.

11:30.172 --> 11:33.073
Do you know
how much I missed you?

11:33.075 --> 11:35.076
Huh?

11:36.043 --> 11:38.581
Jesus!
Suddenly I'm starvin'.

11:39.648 --> 11:41.481
Clean the fish, Ginny.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.816
Yeah, yeah,
I'll make everybody stew.

11:43.818 --> 11:46.419
Yeah, you know,
eh, cooking relaxes my nerves.

11:46.421 --> 11:48.954
Clean the fish?
I got a headache.

11:48.956 --> 11:50.656
Clean the fish, Ginny,

11:50.658 --> 11:53.226
two or three at least,
and put paper down this time.

11:53.228 --> 11:56.032
Last time you got guts
all over the floor.

11:58.032 --> 12:01.266
Hey, you remember, Carolina?

12:01.268 --> 12:03.303
Remember I used to bake?

12:03.305 --> 12:05.237
I used to make you
those chocolate chip cookies?

12:05.239 --> 12:06.539
Mm.

12:06.541 --> 12:08.174
And I'd put
a little salt on it.

12:08.176 --> 12:10.376
You're late.

12:10.378 --> 12:12.478
And you're in real trouble.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.881
You know, you could
kill somebody starting fires.

12:14.883 --> 12:16.616
What kind of craziness is that?

12:16.618 --> 12:19.252
Hey, listen to me.
You could hurt someone.

12:19.254 --> 12:22.322
Well, where'd you get
this idea to make fires?

12:23.959 --> 12:25.691
Jesus, Humpty.
You sound so happy tonight.

12:25.693 --> 12:27.559
What happened?
Your number come in?

12:27.561 --> 12:29.061
Better than
my number came in.

12:29.063 --> 12:30.829
My ship came home.

12:30.831 --> 12:32.832
All right, well, have a good
night at the merry-go-round.

12:32.834 --> 12:34.099
All right, you too, man.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.635
- Smile!
- Oh, that's it.

12:35.637 --> 12:38.237
- Hi, honey.
- Hold on there.

12:38.239 --> 12:40.006
Okay, son, smile.

12:45.980 --> 12:48.516
Oh!

12:49.451 --> 12:51.718
How long's she gonna stay here?

12:51.720 --> 12:54.554
I don't know.
Hey, maybe you can get her a job

12:54.556 --> 12:56.322
at that clam joint
you're working at.

12:56.324 --> 12:57.991
You think that's a good idea?

12:57.993 --> 12:59.958
You said they were
looking for a second waitress.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.029
But they're after her.
Shouldn't she move on?

13:03.031 --> 13:05.298
Move where?

13:05.300 --> 13:06.900
I don't know,
maybe out of the country.

13:06.902 --> 13:08.734
Mexico?

13:08.736 --> 13:10.536
What, are you nuts?

13:10.538 --> 13:13.006
What the hell's
she gonna do in Mexico?

13:13.008 --> 13:14.174
Ah, they're not
coming back here.

13:14.176 --> 13:15.742
She's right.

13:15.744 --> 13:18.611
He knows how we feel
about each other.

13:18.613 --> 13:20.146
Well, we did.

13:20.148 --> 13:22.582
Different now.
Cloud's been lifted.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.583
I don't want guys comin' around
causing trouble.

13:24.585 --> 13:26.486
- There's a kid here.
- Ah, it's okay,

13:26.488 --> 13:28.521
as long as he doesn't
burn himself or kill somebody

13:28.523 --> 13:30.723
with those goddamn fires of his.

13:30.725 --> 13:32.824
He's a moody kid.

13:32.826 --> 13:35.060
He's got a moody mother.

13:35.062 --> 13:37.063
What's that supposed to mean?

13:37.065 --> 13:39.131
Jesus Christ,

13:39.133 --> 13:42.834
I can't believe Carolina's
gonna wind up a waitress.

13:42.836 --> 13:45.671
Thank God Shirley's
in her grave.

13:45.673 --> 13:48.208
What about me
winding up a waitress?

13:48.210 --> 13:50.043
It's not what I had
in mind either.

13:50.045 --> 13:51.978
Hey...

13:51.980 --> 13:54.112
you wanna go fishin'
Friday night?

13:54.114 --> 13:56.882
The boys are bringing the wives.

13:56.884 --> 13:59.252
I don't go fishin', Humpty.

13:59.254 --> 14:00.886
How many times
we have to go over this?

14:00.888 --> 14:03.522
You, you don't like fishin',
you don't like boatin',

14:03.524 --> 14:05.958
you don't like, bowlin'.
What the hell do you like?

14:05.960 --> 14:08.828
You like the radio
and the movie stars, right?

14:08.830 --> 14:11.631
Readin' those goddamn
movie magazines all the time.

14:13.835 --> 14:15.901
I'm worried about Richie.

14:15.903 --> 14:19.104
Yeah, well, let me tell you
something about your son.

14:19.106 --> 14:21.074
He's gonna burn down somethin'.

14:25.146 --> 14:27.280
There you are.

14:27.282 --> 14:29.616
Knew I'd find you here.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.950
- Why aren't you in school?
- I wanna see this picture.

14:31.952 --> 14:35.487
- It's the last day.
- You can't not go to school.

14:35.489 --> 14:37.991
Jesus, Richie, that's why
you're in summer school.

14:37.993 --> 14:40.492
'Cause you missed so many days.
They called again and asked,

14:40.494 --> 14:42.462
- "Is he sick?"
- I don't like school.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.363
It doesn't matter
if you don't like it.

14:44.365 --> 14:46.332
You know, I don't like
waiting on tables,

14:46.334 --> 14:47.800
but we need to eat
and pay the rent.

14:47.802 --> 14:49.801
Some things in life
you have to do

14:49.803 --> 14:52.305
- whether you like it or not.
- Let me watch the picture.

14:52.307 --> 14:54.107
Where'd you get the money
for the movies anyhow?

14:54.109 --> 14:57.043
I took 50 cents out of Humpty's
pants when he was asleep.

14:57.045 --> 14:58.777
What?
You steal from your father?

14:58.779 --> 15:00.545
He's not my father
and I hate him.

15:00.547 --> 15:02.614
Don't you dare say that.

15:02.616 --> 15:04.651
You know, he saved my life.

15:04.653 --> 15:07.987
He's... you know, he's...
he's a good person.

15:07.989 --> 15:09.421
Then why does he hit you?

15:09.423 --> 15:11.958
He doesn't hit me.
Hmm.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.626
Yeah, when he gets drunk
he hits everybody,

15:13.628 --> 15:16.896
but he... he hardly drinks
anymore.

15:16.898 --> 15:18.564
Look, I can't sit here
arguing with you.

15:18.566 --> 15:20.098
I have to go to work.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.833
Go to school, okay?

15:21.835 --> 15:25.505
If I catch you
playing with matches...

15:27.008 --> 15:29.342
Yes, it's a problem.

15:29.344 --> 15:31.410
Kid makes fires.

15:31.412 --> 15:33.212
And not such little ones.

15:41.355 --> 15:42.954
<i>He played hooky
from summer school</i>

15:42.956 --> 15:45.123
<i>and even made fires
on the beach</i>

15:45.125 --> 15:46.825
<i>where it's forbidden.</i>

15:48.330 --> 15:49.896
<i>What the hell does the kid see</i>

15:49.898 --> 15:52.364
<i>when he just stares
into the flames.</i>

15:52.366 --> 15:55.434
<i>Is it the eternal power
of the universe?</i>

15:55.436 --> 15:58.204
<i>The conversion
of mass into energy?</i>

15:58.206 --> 16:00.640
<i>The Furies at work?</i>

16:00.642 --> 16:03.108
<i>Whatever his motive,
it is not appreciated.</i>

16:05.412 --> 16:08.213
Hey!

16:15.389 --> 16:17.256
But what's the conditional?

16:17.258 --> 16:18.724
Oh...

16:18.726 --> 16:21.361
Jesus, Richie,
I c... I can't remember.

16:21.363 --> 16:23.396
I went to school years ago.

16:23.398 --> 16:26.098
God, if you,
if you'd pay attention in class.

16:26.100 --> 16:28.200
You hated school.

16:28.202 --> 16:29.502
What?
No, I didn't.

16:29.504 --> 16:31.971
I liked it.
I liked school.

16:31.973 --> 16:34.406
But I had to quit.
We were poor.

16:34.408 --> 16:36.108
You know, I had to work.

16:36.110 --> 16:38.077
I was lucky.
I was lucky.

16:38.079 --> 16:39.846
I-I had some talent.

16:39.848 --> 16:42.482
You know, I-I was a...
I was a...

16:42.484 --> 16:44.916
I was a very promising
young actress.

16:44.918 --> 16:46.651
Oh, God.

16:46.653 --> 16:48.755
Oh, God, if you coulda seen me
in some of those shows.

16:48.757 --> 16:50.489
Let me show you
a couple of pieces,

16:50.491 --> 16:51.891
- but this is, this...
- Again?

16:51.893 --> 16:53.959
...this is from <i>Dulcy,</i> okay?

16:53.961 --> 16:55.795
You know, I know
I showed you these pieces,

16:55.797 --> 16:57.630
but I never know
if you're paying any attention.

16:57.632 --> 16:59.064
I wore this in <i>Dulcy.</i>
Look at that.

16:59.066 --> 17:00.733
Though it's not real,
but, you know.

17:00.735 --> 17:02.935
- I've seen it.
- Isn't it beautiful?

17:02.937 --> 17:04.836
God, look at that.
It's...

17:04.838 --> 17:06.506
Let me show you this, uh...

17:06.508 --> 17:07.806
Wait, did I show you the,

17:07.808 --> 17:09.441
uh, the piece from the musical?

17:09.443 --> 17:11.176
- Yes.
- From <i>Oh, Kay</i> ?

17:11.179 --> 17:13.979
I don't know if I did.
I had an incredible voice.

17:13.981 --> 17:16.114
You know, I almost got
the lead in that show,

17:16.116 --> 17:18.151
and the, the girl
who got the part...

17:18.153 --> 17:20.152
She was fat.

17:20.154 --> 17:22.454
And I had a much better voice
than her.

17:22.457 --> 17:24.356
Is that where you met Dad?

17:24.358 --> 17:26.391
Yeah.

17:26.393 --> 17:30.430
Yeah, yeah, your real father
was a drummer.

17:30.432 --> 17:32.297
He played jazz music.

17:32.299 --> 17:34.534
God, he had perfect rhythm.

17:34.536 --> 17:37.769
Ah, it was quite amazing.

17:37.771 --> 17:40.605
And he also had black hair
and he had...

17:42.009 --> 17:44.310
...he had green eyes.

17:44.312 --> 17:47.246
Where is my father?

17:47.248 --> 17:48.613
My real father?

17:48.615 --> 17:50.850
I told you many times.

17:50.852 --> 17:53.555
Gone.

17:54.521 --> 17:56.889
A rainy day at the beach.

17:56.891 --> 17:58.591
Time off for me.

17:58.593 --> 18:01.193
Nobody swims
during a lightning storm.

18:03.131 --> 18:06.699
I guess this is as good a time
as any to tell you,

18:06.701 --> 18:10.635
I'm having an affair with Ginny,
Humpty's wife.

18:10.637 --> 18:12.805
Let me fill you in on that.

18:12.807 --> 18:15.074
It started at the beginning
of the summer.

18:15.076 --> 18:18.611
At that point I didn't know
either Humpty or Ginny.

18:56.284 --> 18:58.884
<i>And then,
at the end of a cloudy day,</i>

18:58.886 --> 19:01.720
<i>it started to rain,
and the last few stragglers</i>

19:01.722 --> 19:03.855
<i>were packing up
and leaving the beach.</i>

19:03.857 --> 19:06.225
<i>And suddenly this
kind of interesting woman</i>

19:06.227 --> 19:08.494
<i>comes walking along
the water's edge,</i>

19:08.496 --> 19:10.028
<i>and the dramatist in me sensed</i>

19:10.030 --> 19:11.898
<i>she was in
some kind of trouble</i>

19:11.900 --> 19:14.400
<i>because her body language
read vulnerable</i>

19:14.402 --> 19:16.635
<i>and desperate.</i>

19:16.637 --> 19:18.804
Miss.

19:18.806 --> 19:20.805
You can't be out here
right now.

19:20.807 --> 19:23.077
Everybody has to go in.

19:24.479 --> 19:26.912
We're expecting
lightning storms.

19:26.914 --> 19:28.581
- What?
- We gotta,

19:28.583 --> 19:31.683
we gotta go in.
We gotta clear the beach.

19:31.685 --> 19:35.688
- Really?
- Yeah, we gotta go in.

19:37.592 --> 19:40.759
Yeah, I-I been
all over the world.

19:40.761 --> 19:43.028
I went to NYU and...

19:43.030 --> 19:46.666
...right when I started,
boom, the Japs hit Pearl Harbor.

19:46.668 --> 19:49.701
So after I got out,
I went back to school,

19:49.703 --> 19:51.938
and now I'm working
to get my master's.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.574
But I-I don't resent
my years in the Navy.

19:54.576 --> 19:56.708
I mean, I really saw the world.

19:56.710 --> 19:58.110
You ever travel?

19:58.112 --> 19:59.711
Not really.

19:59.713 --> 20:01.581
No place magical.

20:01.583 --> 20:04.216
You wanna know the best place
I ever saw?

20:04.218 --> 20:05.884
Where's that?

20:05.886 --> 20:07.519
Bora Bora.

20:07.521 --> 20:09.087
I heard of it.

20:09.089 --> 20:12.792
It's over by Tahiti
where Gauguin ran away to paint.

20:12.794 --> 20:14.826
The water there...

20:14.828 --> 20:17.729
...is so clear and unspoiled.

20:17.731 --> 20:21.299
You can look down and see
all the bright colored fish,

20:21.301 --> 20:23.736
bright red and yellow fish.

20:23.738 --> 20:26.005
And, and the flowers
are amazing.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.273
And at night,

20:27.275 --> 20:29.874
you never saw stars like that
on this planet.

20:29.876 --> 20:33.778
You can actually read
by starlight.

20:33.780 --> 20:35.917
What're you gonna write?

20:36.851 --> 20:38.351
Plays about human life.

20:38.353 --> 20:40.052
Great tragic plays

20:40.054 --> 20:42.321
where the protagonist
gets crushed

20:42.323 --> 20:44.422
because of some fatal weakness.

20:44.424 --> 20:46.561
Like what?

20:48.762 --> 20:50.462
My tragic flaw is

20:50.464 --> 20:53.332
I'm too romantic a character.

20:53.334 --> 20:56.701
You ever hear that song,
"I Fall in Love Too Easily"?

20:56.703 --> 20:59.205
You always...

20:59.207 --> 21:02.374
...think a person's tragedy
is their own fault?

21:02.376 --> 21:03.776
No.

21:03.778 --> 21:05.143
Fate plays a big role.

21:05.145 --> 21:07.846
More stuff in life
is out of our control

21:07.848 --> 21:09.884
than we'd like to admit.

21:10.550 --> 21:12.753
Except...

21:13.587 --> 21:15.790
I brought my troubles on myself.

21:17.124 --> 21:18.490
Yeah.

21:18.492 --> 21:20.793
I guessed that when I saw you.

21:20.795 --> 21:22.728
I thought,
"She's very pretty,

21:22.730 --> 21:25.232
but somewhere
there's a tragic flaw."

21:27.835 --> 21:30.905
Yeah, I made a mistake.

21:31.772 --> 21:34.108
But that was years ago.

21:35.008 --> 21:38.410
I'll never make that
mistake again.

21:38.412 --> 21:40.348
Yes?

21:41.783 --> 21:44.150
I have to go.

21:44.152 --> 21:45.851
Hey...

21:45.853 --> 21:48.890
...you think you'll make it down
to the beach again soon?

21:50.324 --> 21:52.958
Yeah, I might.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.895
I might.

21:57.964 --> 22:00.301
Where'd you go today?
Came home late.

22:01.001 --> 22:03.270
Took a walk
on the beach.

22:04.605 --> 22:06.572
That's unlike you.

22:06.574 --> 22:08.274
I was in a funny mood.

22:10.877 --> 22:14.580
Hey, you wanna go
to Yankee Stadium Sunday?

22:14.582 --> 22:16.449
It's the Red Sox.

22:16.451 --> 22:18.083
It's not me, Humpty.

22:18.085 --> 22:20.419
For the millionth time,
I don't care about baseball.

22:20.421 --> 22:22.020
But you used to go.

22:22.022 --> 22:23.689
Well, I tried to get interested
for your sake.

22:23.691 --> 22:25.861
I couldn't do it.

22:28.429 --> 22:30.696
You wanna go?
I got an extra ticket.

22:30.698 --> 22:33.332
I wanna go to the movies.

22:33.334 --> 22:34.933
You know what?

22:34.935 --> 22:38.603
You're gonna hurt your eyes
in so many movies.

22:38.605 --> 22:40.005
Your just like your mother.

22:40.007 --> 22:42.941
She listens to that crap
on the radio,

22:42.943 --> 22:45.312
she thinks it's real.

22:46.814 --> 22:49.515
I wanna be honest with you,
Mickey.

22:49.517 --> 22:51.018
I'm married.

22:52.452 --> 22:54.186
I'm a married woman.

22:54.188 --> 22:57.124
I wanna be honest with you,
Mickey.

22:58.860 --> 23:01.593
I'm a married woman.

23:01.595 --> 23:04.766
I'm married, Mickey.

23:05.900 --> 23:07.900
I felt strange mentioning it.

23:07.902 --> 23:11.170
Not that you asked.

23:11.172 --> 23:13.538
I got myself
into a bad situation.

23:13.540 --> 23:16.977
I got myself... I got myself
into a bad situation.

23:18.712 --> 23:21.112
You're right.
I had...

23:21.114 --> 23:23.882
I had notions
about ending everything.

23:23.884 --> 23:26.754
Thought about drowning.

23:28.322 --> 23:32.624
Of course, with a kid,
that's not an option.

23:32.626 --> 23:34.392
Besides...

23:34.394 --> 23:37.563
...you'd have dived in
and ruined my dramatic finale.

23:41.768 --> 23:44.335
I feel trapped.
I feel trapped.

23:47.575 --> 23:49.507
<i>Ginny did come back
to the beach.</i>

23:49.509 --> 23:51.910
<i>And she looked sexy.</i>

23:51.912 --> 23:53.112
<i>And I knew a spot</i>

23:53.114 --> 23:55.147
<i>on the far end of the boardwalk.</i>

24:13.701 --> 24:16.535
I have something
to tell you.

24:16.537 --> 24:19.508
Two things to tell.

24:22.844 --> 24:24.442
Nothing you could tell me

24:24.444 --> 24:27.414
could put the slightest shadow
on this evening.

24:28.583 --> 24:31.119
I'm not 35.

24:32.452 --> 24:34.189
I'm 38.

24:35.522 --> 24:38.492
I'm 39.

24:39.393 --> 24:42.827
Ah, that's a very hot age
for a woman.

24:42.829 --> 24:44.897
I'm a very lucky guy.

24:44.899 --> 24:47.936
I'm old... older than you.

24:48.702 --> 24:50.337
What's the second thing?

24:51.471 --> 24:53.738
I'm married.

24:53.740 --> 24:55.506
You are?

24:55.508 --> 24:57.476
I have a husband

24:57.478 --> 25:00.078
and a child
from my first marriage.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.947
You thought, uh...

25:01.949 --> 25:04.486
you thought it would
spoil everything, right?

25:05.853 --> 25:07.823
Has it?

25:09.356 --> 25:13.525
It's not the first time I've
found a married woman beautiful.

25:13.527 --> 25:16.594
I ruined my life by...

25:16.596 --> 25:21.699
by being unfaithful once,
and now I'm doing it again.

25:21.701 --> 25:23.435
You brought about
your own downfall

25:23.437 --> 25:25.470
by being unfaithful?

25:29.110 --> 25:31.413
It was someone I loved.

25:34.281 --> 25:36.183
A drummer.

25:37.250 --> 25:40.221
Whose rhythm pulsated with life.

25:41.489 --> 25:44.856
And we married and had a child,
and...

25:44.858 --> 25:46.758
...he adored me.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.826
And yet...

25:48.828 --> 25:50.595
Oh, and yet I c...

25:50.597 --> 25:53.097
...couldn't resist the beautiful
young man in the cast

25:53.099 --> 25:55.968
who played Marchbanks.

25:55.970 --> 25:57.535
God, he wasn't even
the leading man,

25:57.537 --> 26:00.072
but he, but he kissed me onstage
every night

26:00.074 --> 26:02.474
and I started looking forward
to those kisses,

26:02.476 --> 26:04.276
and... and, um...

26:04.278 --> 26:07.880
I wound up in his bed,
and...

26:07.882 --> 26:12.051
and then my husband found out
and...

26:12.053 --> 26:14.356
and it crushed him.

26:16.190 --> 26:19.427
Oh, he deserved
so much better than me.

26:21.194 --> 26:24.131
I-I broke his heart.

26:25.766 --> 26:28.470
Humiliated, he ran away.

26:30.470 --> 26:34.006
I didn't blame him for going
as far from me as he could,

26:34.008 --> 26:36.775
and when he left...

26:36.777 --> 26:41.048
I learned for the first time
what love was.

26:42.950 --> 26:46.017
But I was too late

26:46.019 --> 26:48.187
because he was gone.

26:48.189 --> 26:51.226
And I started coming apart.

26:52.293 --> 26:54.226
Oh, I-I couldn't act anymore.

26:54.228 --> 26:55.760
I couldn't keep my mind
on my role.

26:55.762 --> 26:57.161
I...

26:57.163 --> 26:59.664
I-I'd forget my lines,

26:59.666 --> 27:02.000
miss my cues,

27:02.002 --> 27:03.736
and I drank,

27:03.738 --> 27:07.672
and I lost work.

27:07.674 --> 27:09.541
And Harold...

27:09.543 --> 27:13.578
...Humpty,
who was also a lost soul,

27:13.580 --> 27:17.248
met me at a diner and thought
I was the prettiest thing,

27:17.250 --> 27:19.751
the belle of the ball, and...

27:19.753 --> 27:22.353
...and we helped one another
scramble back onto our feet,

27:22.355 --> 27:24.055
and it's been five years,
and...

27:24.057 --> 27:26.493
...and I owe him a lot.

27:27.495 --> 27:29.594
But just as I learned
from my first husband

27:29.596 --> 27:31.529
what love was...

27:31.531 --> 27:35.736
...I... I learned from Humpty
what it was not.

27:37.037 --> 27:39.971
It's not gratitude.
It's not company.

27:39.973 --> 27:42.440
And it's not going through
the motions of lovemaking

27:42.442 --> 27:45.710
when... you have so much to give.

27:45.712 --> 27:49.451
And no one
you really wanna give it to.

28:02.662 --> 28:05.497
<i>And so it was
a pretty intense summer,</i>

28:05.499 --> 28:07.498
<i>and not just the humidity.</i>

28:07.500 --> 28:09.133
<i>I was involved
in a relationship</i>

28:09.135 --> 28:11.170
<i>with an older, ex-actress,</i>

28:11.172 --> 28:13.805
<i>unhappily married,
and love starved.</i>

28:13.807 --> 28:16.108
<i>She made up
one lie after another</i>

28:16.110 --> 28:18.776
<i>to filch time to see me.</i>

28:32.692 --> 28:34.293
I've never been
to Greenwich Village.

28:34.295 --> 28:35.960
It's got a lot of meaning
for me.

28:35.962 --> 28:38.863
All the artists and writers
I love hung out here,

28:38.865 --> 28:40.731
and it's close to school.

28:42.403 --> 28:45.070
All right.
Remember...

28:45.072 --> 28:47.738
...it's nothing
but a rented hovel.

28:51.479 --> 28:53.879
Wow.

28:53.881 --> 28:55.680
Ah, it's cozy.

28:55.682 --> 28:57.015
That's very tactful.

29:04.991 --> 29:07.391
These beautiful gardens.

29:07.393 --> 29:10.065
How do you find these places?

29:12.232 --> 29:14.266
My fantasy is that...

29:14.268 --> 29:16.067
is that you write a play

29:16.069 --> 29:18.437
with a character in
it I could play.

29:18.439 --> 29:21.372
"Making her triumphant return
to the stage,

29:21.374 --> 29:23.708
Miss Virginia..."
- Virginia DeLorean.

29:23.710 --> 29:26.545
Virginia DeLorean.
Not Ginny Jablon.

29:26.547 --> 29:28.412
- Wow.
- "In tonight's performance,

29:28.414 --> 29:32.683
the part of Juliet will be
played by Virginia DeLorean."

29:32.685 --> 29:35.353
I love it.
That was your maiden name?

29:35.355 --> 29:36.822
My real name was Westlake,

29:36.824 --> 29:40.491
but, but I took DeLorean
as a, as a stage name.

29:40.493 --> 29:43.128
- Hmm.
- God, all that summer stock

29:43.130 --> 29:45.831
and hard work so I could afford
acting lessons

29:45.833 --> 29:47.199
just so I could...

29:47.201 --> 29:49.000
just so I could wind up
playing the part

29:49.002 --> 29:53.071
of a waitress
in a clam house.

29:53.073 --> 29:54.840
I am playing a part.

29:54.842 --> 29:56.408
You know, it's not me.

29:56.410 --> 29:58.075
It's not me.
You think, you think it's me?

29:58.077 --> 29:59.545
- No, I...
- Oh, God.

29:59.547 --> 30:03.347
I-I mean, I act it every day,
but I'm acting.

30:03.349 --> 30:05.750
I'm not a waitress
in a clam house.

30:05.752 --> 30:07.952
- There's more to me than that.
- I...

30:07.954 --> 30:09.254
I mean, I'm just playing

30:09.256 --> 30:11.256
the thankless role
of the waitress.

30:11.258 --> 30:12.623
Hey, hey.

30:12.625 --> 30:15.026
- Ginny, wh...
- I'm sorry.

30:15.028 --> 30:17.930
I'm unraveling.

30:17.932 --> 30:19.664
Promise me we'll come back here.

30:24.605 --> 30:26.270
<i>She had less trouble
slipping away</i>

30:26.272 --> 30:27.939
<i>after Humpty's daughter
showed up</i>

30:27.941 --> 30:31.679
<i>because he was so happy
to see Carolina back.</i>

30:32.779 --> 30:35.180
Guess which number
came in today?

30:35.182 --> 30:37.583
Oh, which?

30:37.585 --> 30:39.985
Mine.

30:39.987 --> 30:42.019
300 bucks.

30:42.021 --> 30:43.455
This is for your night school.

30:43.457 --> 30:44.823
Good because
I have one picked out.

30:44.825 --> 30:46.358
Good 'cause
I don't want you waitressing

30:46.360 --> 30:48.693
all your goddamn life.

31:29.303 --> 31:31.570
Hey, You Humpty?

31:31.572 --> 31:34.640
- Yeah.
- Frank Adato says hello.

31:34.642 --> 31:37.375
He's very upset because
his wife's gone missing,

31:37.377 --> 31:39.880
and we're trying to find her.

31:41.181 --> 31:42.581
Ah.

31:42.583 --> 31:45.484
Since, uh,
she's your daughter,

31:45.486 --> 31:47.753
we thought we'd
check with you.

31:47.755 --> 31:51.993
Well, I haven't seen Carolina
in years.

31:53.527 --> 31:55.560
We're not on good terms.

31:55.562 --> 31:58.263
Frank must have told you that.

31:58.265 --> 32:01.365
I haven't spoken to her
in five years.

32:01.367 --> 32:04.169
I don't know.
I lost track of her

32:04.171 --> 32:06.004
after she ran off
and got married.

32:06.006 --> 32:07.706
- Uh-huh, really?
- Yeah.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.541
Do me a favor.
I'm talking to you.

32:09.543 --> 32:12.313
Stop working, all right?

32:15.182 --> 32:17.649
You try California?

32:17.651 --> 32:22.054
She always talked about living
in San Francisco or Los Angeles.

32:22.056 --> 32:25.423
I don't know.
I wouldn't even recognize her.

32:25.425 --> 32:27.491
We just thought maybe
she'd turn up here.

32:27.493 --> 32:29.928
Yeah, well,
she wouldn't find me.

32:29.930 --> 32:33.899
I moved three or four times
in five years.

32:33.901 --> 32:35.667
I mean, how the hell'd
you find me?

32:35.669 --> 32:38.536
Frank's very worried about her.

32:38.538 --> 32:43.041
Well, she'll never turn up here,

32:43.043 --> 32:44.709
and if she does,

32:44.711 --> 32:46.911
I'll tell her Frank's
looking for her, all right?

32:46.913 --> 32:48.513
Hey, Humpty.

32:48.515 --> 32:50.381
Did you hit him again?

32:50.383 --> 32:52.183
I told you.

32:52.185 --> 32:55.687
I told you next time I catch him
taking money out of my pocket...

32:55.689 --> 32:58.590
And I told you
not to hit him.

32:58.592 --> 33:01.226
All right.
We'll talk about it later.

33:01.228 --> 33:03.495
I'm talking
to these gentlemen here.

33:03.497 --> 33:04.996
Go home.
We'll discuss it later.

33:04.998 --> 33:07.099
How do you do?

33:07.101 --> 33:09.200
This is my wife.

33:09.202 --> 33:11.402
Stepson.
Go on, go on home.

33:11.404 --> 33:13.037
We're looking
for Carolina Adato.

33:13.039 --> 33:16.074
- I told 'em.
- Humpty's daughter.

33:16.076 --> 33:17.708
I told 'em.

33:17.710 --> 33:20.077
I haven't seen her
in five years.

33:20.079 --> 33:21.779
Yeah, yeah, he disowned her.

33:21.781 --> 33:23.347
She'd never show her face
around her.

33:23.349 --> 33:24.783
Let's go.

33:24.785 --> 33:26.584
Is that a gun?

33:26.586 --> 33:29.153
Sharp kid.
They're very dangerous.

33:29.155 --> 33:31.922
You people would never
try to hide her, would you?

33:31.924 --> 33:34.325
Hide her for what?
What'd she do?

33:34.327 --> 33:36.894
You know,
you're a nice family.

33:36.896 --> 33:39.965
I wouldn't like to see you
get into trouble.

33:39.967 --> 33:41.400
Can I see the gun?

33:41.402 --> 33:44.669
No, you can't.
Let's go, Richie.

33:44.671 --> 33:47.107
See you later, Humpty.

33:49.143 --> 33:52.046
Hey, what can I tell you?

33:55.915 --> 33:57.481
She's not here.

33:57.483 --> 33:59.683
Frank says there's bad blood
between 'em.

33:59.685 --> 34:01.752
Maybe California's
a better idea,

34:01.754 --> 34:03.821
and I'm startin' to think
we ain't gonna find her.

34:03.823 --> 34:06.426
No.
I'm gonna find her.

34:07.227 --> 34:08.726
Wanna get some oysters?

34:08.728 --> 34:10.495
They probably got great oysters
in here.

34:10.496 --> 34:12.431
Oh, I love oysters.

34:12.433 --> 34:15.766
Eh, but do we got time?
Vinnie.

34:15.768 --> 34:18.437
Christ, 5:00
we gotta meet him in Hoboken?

34:18.438 --> 34:20.105
You know the way he gets
when we're late.

34:20.107 --> 34:21.440
Come on.

34:21.442 --> 34:23.706
God.
I coulda went for oysters.

34:23.708 --> 34:27.411
Hey, John,
I need two beers.

34:27.413 --> 34:29.047
Hey, what's your name?

34:29.049 --> 34:30.281
Why?

34:30.283 --> 34:31.683
What time do you get off?

34:31.685 --> 34:33.451
I don't get off.
I go right to school.

34:33.453 --> 34:35.020
Oh.
Night school?

34:35.022 --> 34:37.589
- That's right.
- What are you studying?

34:37.591 --> 34:39.290
To be an English teacher.

34:39.292 --> 34:41.393
- Here you go, two beers.
- What time is class over?

34:41.395 --> 34:44.029
- I got a lot of homework.
- Aw, I'm strikin' out here.

34:44.031 --> 34:45.864
When do you graduate?

34:45.866 --> 34:48.833
<i>And so the angel
of death passed over them</i>

34:48.835 --> 34:50.734
<i>and headed out west,</i>

34:50.735 --> 34:52.870
<i>but his shadow was scary.</i>

34:52.871 --> 34:56.440
<i>It took a few days
of summer sun to decompress.</i>

34:56.442 --> 34:58.743
<i>Life on the boardwalk
provided the tourists</i>

34:58.745 --> 35:01.513
<i>with cheap thrills
and great hot dogs.</i>

35:01.515 --> 35:03.681
<i>When she wasn't
breaking dishes</i>

35:03.683 --> 35:05.183
<i>or customer's hearts,</i>

35:05.185 --> 35:07.118
<i>Carolina took
a limited program</i>

35:07.120 --> 35:08.819
<i>at night school.</i>

35:08.821 --> 35:11.323
<i>And when Humpty
wasn't trying to get riders</i>

35:11.325 --> 35:13.824
<i>for those empty horses
on the carousel,</i>

35:13.826 --> 35:16.027
<i>he was off chasing
fluke and flounder.</i>

35:16.029 --> 35:18.163
Your wife don't like to go
fishing anymore, Humpty.

35:18.165 --> 35:19.931
Ah.

35:19.933 --> 35:23.000
She never really liked it.
She made like she liked it...

35:23.002 --> 35:25.536
...to get me on the hook.

35:25.538 --> 35:27.707
I was the fish.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.515
Careful, careful.

35:44.658 --> 35:46.558
I used to hate the rain.

35:46.560 --> 35:47.958
Now I love it

35:47.960 --> 35:49.627
'cause it means
you get time off.

35:49.629 --> 35:51.428
Oh, one of the perks
of being a lifeguard.

35:51.430 --> 35:53.531
Yeah, now I see rain
through your eyes,

35:53.533 --> 35:56.067
and it's beautiful.

35:57.904 --> 36:00.839
You know, you'd go crazy
over Bora Bora.

36:00.841 --> 36:03.174
The sunsets, the sunrises.

36:03.176 --> 36:04.776
Paradise.

36:04.778 --> 36:07.444
I'd go off with you
any place you asked me to.

36:09.482 --> 36:12.484
You say your miserable
at home with Humpty.

36:12.486 --> 36:14.419
W-w-why do you stay
with the guy?

36:14.421 --> 36:17.989
Oh.
Me and Richie?

36:17.991 --> 36:19.790
What a joke.

36:19.792 --> 36:21.326
Waiting on tables,

36:21.328 --> 36:23.161
trying to suck
nickel and dime tips

36:23.163 --> 36:25.196
out of redneck clowns
wearing lobster bibs?

36:25.198 --> 36:27.531
Yeah, I know.
It is pretty sleazy

36:27.533 --> 36:28.866
what's happened
to Coney Island.

36:28.868 --> 36:30.835
Hey, I don't wanna spoil
the rainy day.

36:30.837 --> 36:33.305
Tell me about
the Chekhov play you read.

36:33.307 --> 36:34.806
No, you tell me.

36:34.808 --> 36:37.074
You ever play Chekhov?

36:37.076 --> 36:38.475
I can't remember.

36:38.477 --> 36:40.344
Maybe once in Baltimore.

36:40.346 --> 36:42.480
When an actress got sick.

36:52.158 --> 36:54.692
How's it coming?

36:54.694 --> 36:58.062
Well...
I know he has feelings for me.

36:58.064 --> 37:00.864
I-I know it's not
just a summer thing.

37:00.866 --> 37:03.567
Oh, God, I hope
I'm not misreading it all.

37:03.569 --> 37:06.170
I try to,
I try to push him

37:06.172 --> 37:09.239
without being
one of those pushy women.

37:09.241 --> 37:12.109
You know, I don... don't want
my desperation to show.

37:12.111 --> 37:16.513
Well, there's progress,
but, but it's slow.

37:16.515 --> 37:18.549
You know?

37:18.551 --> 37:21.085
God, if the summer ends
and it fizzles out

37:21.087 --> 37:23.687
and I'm left at square one,
I don't know what I'll do.

37:23.689 --> 37:25.723
Well, you'll survive
like we all do.

37:25.725 --> 37:28.192
No, no, I'm not
a strong person.

37:28.194 --> 37:30.027
I wouldn't have survived
my breakdown

37:30.029 --> 37:32.029
if it wasn't for Humpty.
Now I'm feeling claustrophobic,

37:32.031 --> 37:34.899
- the headaches are back...
- You just have to be realistic.

37:34.901 --> 37:37.268
In case things
don't go your way.

37:37.270 --> 37:39.971
There's nothing realistic
about a Chinese garden

37:39.973 --> 37:42.540
in the middle of Staten Island,
but...

37:42.542 --> 37:45.844
but it's, it's where
I want to be with him.

37:45.846 --> 37:48.045
How's Richie doing?

37:48.047 --> 37:49.647
Richie?

37:49.649 --> 37:51.049
Oh, I never know
what's on his mind.

38:20.913 --> 38:24.049
I love your hair like this.
You look ten years younger.

38:24.051 --> 38:25.683
- You think?
- Uh-huh.

38:25.685 --> 38:27.819
Oh, I wish I had
your kind of hair.

38:27.821 --> 38:31.455
- Hey, Ginny.
- The rainy weather kills me.

38:31.457 --> 38:33.058
Oh.

38:33.060 --> 38:34.625
- Oh, hi, hi.
- Hi.

38:34.627 --> 38:37.395
Hi.
Um, this is Mickey.

38:37.397 --> 38:39.698
- Hello.
- In case you never noticed,

38:39.700 --> 38:41.198
he's the lifeguard
on Bay Seven.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.401
- Oh.
- This is my husband's daughter.

38:43.403 --> 38:46.437
- Carolina.
- I swim at Bay Seven sometimes.

38:46.439 --> 38:49.473
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

38:49.475 --> 38:51.875
We have to go.

38:51.877 --> 38:54.279
Just don't drown in Bay Seven
or they'll fire me.

38:56.149 --> 38:58.750
- We, we should get going.
- Okay.

38:58.752 --> 39:02.553
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

39:02.555 --> 39:04.955
- Cute.
- Do you like my hair?

39:04.957 --> 39:08.125
Hmm?
Oh, yes, it's lovely.

39:08.127 --> 39:09.594
Beautiful.

39:16.303 --> 39:18.502
Hey,
I saw your daughter last night.

39:18.504 --> 39:21.071
- She was with a soldier.
- Ah, Jesus Christ.

39:21.073 --> 39:23.274
You put a uniform on a guy
and they lose their head.

39:23.276 --> 39:25.375
- It's true.
- I saw her with a sailor.

39:25.377 --> 39:27.911
She's a very patriotic girl.

39:27.913 --> 39:29.413
Ah, well,
she's pretty, Humpty.

39:29.415 --> 39:31.315
You gotta expect some trouble,
you know?

39:31.317 --> 39:32.884
- That's right.
- Her mother was pretty.

39:32.886 --> 39:34.585
And a saint.

39:34.587 --> 39:36.154
This girl's got a high IQ.

39:36.156 --> 39:38.123
Her mother saw the number.

39:38.125 --> 39:40.091
I play the IQ number,
but it never comes in.

39:40.093 --> 39:41.792
You know,
I'm sure she can handle herself.

39:41.794 --> 39:43.227
She's been married.
She knows the score.

39:43.229 --> 39:45.096
Yeah, he's right, you know.

39:45.098 --> 39:46.931
Once a woman's divorced,
she's fair game, you know?

39:46.933 --> 39:48.366
That's right.
I'm glad I got boys though.

39:48.368 --> 39:49.968
She's goin' to night school.

39:49.970 --> 39:51.536
She's gonna be
an English teacher.

39:51.538 --> 39:53.203
Yeah, right,
if some soldier doesn't

39:53.205 --> 39:54.906
- knock her up first.
- What the hell?

39:54.908 --> 39:56.540
Come on, come on,
I'm just kidding!

39:56.542 --> 39:58.343
Look, look how red he gets?
Look over at Humpty.

39:58.345 --> 40:00.178
What kind of thing
is that to say?

40:00.180 --> 40:01.980
She don't look like
any English teacher I in school.

40:01.982 --> 40:03.647
Yeah, yeah,
what school did you go to?

40:03.649 --> 40:05.183
You didn't go to school,
you idiot.

40:05.185 --> 40:07.087
I went to
the school of hard knocks.

40:08.421 --> 40:11.689
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:11.691 --> 40:13.991
- Remember me?
- Of course.

40:13.993 --> 40:15.660
We met outside the movie theater
the other night.

40:15.662 --> 40:17.661
- Yes.
- Oh, gosh.

40:17.663 --> 40:19.397
Yes, with Ginny.

40:19.399 --> 40:22.766
You said you sometimes use
Bay Seven.

40:22.768 --> 40:24.602
Yes, I remember.

40:24.604 --> 40:26.504
I was hoping to get some tan,

40:26.506 --> 40:30.044
- but it's gotten so overcast.
- Yeah, storm clouds.

40:30.944 --> 40:32.743
What is it?

40:32.745 --> 40:34.812
- <i>Hamlet and Oedipus...</i>
- Yeah.

40:34.814 --> 40:36.881
By Ernest Jones.

40:36.883 --> 40:39.116
My goodness,
that sounds deep.

40:39.118 --> 40:41.953
It's not that deep when you're
familiar with the total picture.

40:41.955 --> 40:44.055
What total picture is that?

40:44.057 --> 40:46.558
Well, <i>Hamlet,</i> of course.

40:46.560 --> 40:49.093
I haven't read <i>Hamlet</i>
since high school.

40:49.095 --> 40:50.828
But you've seen it performed.

40:50.830 --> 40:52.763
Once.
And not very well.

40:52.765 --> 40:54.364
I love the theater,

40:54.366 --> 40:56.067
but I haven't seen
that many shows.

40:56.069 --> 40:58.169
Ignorance is no sin.

40:58.171 --> 41:00.839
It just means your experience
hasn't brought you into contact

41:00.841 --> 41:02.607
- with certain things.
- Hmm.

41:02.609 --> 41:03.741
Did you finish school?

41:03.743 --> 41:06.143
No, I got sidetracked.

41:06.145 --> 41:09.013
Yeah, me too.
Uncle Sam.

41:09.015 --> 41:10.518
What's your story?

41:11.484 --> 41:13.417
I got married too quickly.

41:13.419 --> 41:15.152
But it's all over.

41:15.154 --> 41:16.721
Wow.

41:16.723 --> 41:18.690
Marriage is a big step,
isn't it?

41:18.692 --> 41:20.390
- Mm.
- Scary.

41:20.392 --> 41:21.928
What'd your husband do?

41:23.163 --> 41:25.529
Shouldn't you be looking out
for drowning people?

41:25.531 --> 41:27.531
No one ever drowns here,

41:27.533 --> 41:29.366
but I should.
Yes.

41:29.368 --> 41:32.102
Listen, I'm actually
through with this book,

41:32.104 --> 41:33.971
so if you want,
you can borrow it,

41:33.973 --> 41:35.138
and then when you're
finished with it

41:35.140 --> 41:36.507
we can discuss it more fully.

41:36.509 --> 41:38.308
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:38.310 --> 41:39.844
I'd like that.

41:39.846 --> 41:41.379
Yes.

42:04.203 --> 42:06.971
You know who I ran into
yesterday at the beach?

42:06.973 --> 42:08.640
The lifeguard, Mickey.

42:08.642 --> 42:10.308
- You did?
- Yeah.

42:10.310 --> 42:12.509
I was leaving and I noticed him,
so I said hello.

42:12.511 --> 42:14.913
He was sitting up there reading
and he dropped down

42:14.915 --> 42:16.580
and we talked.

42:16.582 --> 42:18.683
He's very nice.

42:18.685 --> 42:19.917
Yeah?

42:19.919 --> 42:21.451
And he's well educated.

42:21.453 --> 42:24.989
He's studying at college
to write plays.

42:24.991 --> 42:26.424
- Uh-huh.
- I thought that

42:26.426 --> 42:28.458
would interest you
since you acted.

42:28.460 --> 42:29.960
And he had a book
about <i>Hamlet,</i>

42:29.962 --> 42:32.497
a psychological study.

42:32.499 --> 42:34.031
Uh-huh.

42:34.033 --> 42:35.533
I haven't read <i>Hamlet</i>
for years,

42:35.535 --> 42:39.002
and he tried not
to make me feel so dumb.

42:39.004 --> 42:41.339
He was sweet.

42:41.341 --> 42:44.341
- How long'd you chat?
- Five minutes.

42:44.343 --> 42:46.544
I had to go home and shower
and dress for a date,

42:46.546 --> 42:49.446
a nice guy from night school
took me to the movies.

42:49.448 --> 42:52.352
Not that I'd like
to see him again.

42:53.053 --> 42:55.752
That's, that's all you talked
about with Mickey?

42:55.754 --> 42:57.487
Yeah.

42:57.489 --> 42:59.690
Actually...

42:59.692 --> 43:02.727
I kind of found him attractive.

43:02.729 --> 43:05.763
- Did you?
- I'm probably reading into it,

43:05.765 --> 43:08.699
but I think
he kind of liked me.

43:08.701 --> 43:12.770
He said I could borrow his book
and we could talk about it.

43:12.772 --> 43:15.540
That flounder was great.

43:15.542 --> 43:17.241
You know, that's the beauty
of being able

43:17.243 --> 43:19.544
to catch your supper fresh.

43:19.546 --> 43:23.815
It's not just the money.
It's the flavor.

43:23.817 --> 43:25.515
- Carolina.
- Uh-huh?

43:25.517 --> 43:30.053
Connie Ryan and Leo
think you're a knockout.

43:30.055 --> 43:31.823
Yeah, they kidded me

43:31.825 --> 43:33.924
about seeing you
with that soldier.

43:33.926 --> 43:35.493
- Oh, Rusty Ford.
- Mm-hmm.

43:35.495 --> 43:37.962
No, he's a real hero.
He fought in Okinawa.

43:37.964 --> 43:40.330
Hey, what am I, the hired help?

43:40.332 --> 43:42.600
You ever think
of clearing your own stuff?

43:42.602 --> 43:45.602
I'm sorry, I... every time I try,
you sit me back down.

43:45.604 --> 43:48.406
That's because we can't afford
to have any more dishes broken,

43:48.408 --> 43:51.174
but you could overrule me
and just be careful.

43:51.176 --> 43:53.176
Oh, of course.
No, I'm happy to help.

43:53.178 --> 43:55.913
I'd do the dishes,
but I just did my nails.

43:55.915 --> 43:57.815
Well, I don't feel
like doing them tonight.

43:57.817 --> 44:00.083
She just did her nails.

44:00.085 --> 44:01.786
When you're married
to a man who got rich

44:01.788 --> 44:03.221
putting people's feet in cement,

44:03.223 --> 44:04.756
you probably never
had to do a dish.

44:04.758 --> 44:06.056
I'll do it.

44:06.058 --> 44:08.725
- I'll do it.
- I got it.

44:08.727 --> 44:11.029
Starring as the waitress.

44:11.031 --> 44:13.698
- Something's eating her.
- It's my fault.

44:13.700 --> 44:15.399
I should insist
on doing more around here.

44:15.401 --> 44:16.701
- Well...
- No, she's right.

44:16.703 --> 44:18.102
I'm not used to it,

44:18.104 --> 44:19.469
and between work and studying,
I...

44:19.471 --> 44:22.642
Listen, just get home early.
That's all.

44:23.877 --> 44:26.643
Hey, was everything okay?

44:26.645 --> 44:28.446
Yeah.

44:28.448 --> 44:29.547
Why?

44:29.549 --> 44:32.386
Well, you seemed
a little distracted.

44:34.154 --> 44:37.855
Carolina told me you
ran into her at the beach.

44:37.857 --> 44:39.257
Ran into her?

44:39.259 --> 44:41.993
I nearly hit her in the head
with my book.

44:41.995 --> 44:43.794
She said you lent it to her.

44:43.796 --> 44:46.497
- Yeah, she was interested.
- You shouldn't read up there.

44:46.499 --> 44:48.433
People trust you
with their lives.

44:48.435 --> 44:50.234
So what'd you talk
to her about?

44:50.236 --> 44:52.303
Nothing.
My book, <i>Hamlet.</i>

44:52.305 --> 44:54.071
She said she quit school
to get married.

44:54.073 --> 44:55.839
To a gangster.

44:55.841 --> 44:57.442
Really?

44:57.444 --> 45:00.044
- How interesting.
- You find that interesting?

45:00.046 --> 45:02.045
They're after her.
They wanna kill her.

45:02.047 --> 45:03.281
You better be careful.

45:03.283 --> 45:04.882
I get the creeps
living with her.

45:04.884 --> 45:07.151
- I wish she'd move on.
- She never mentioned it.

45:07.153 --> 45:09.053
Well, she wouldn't.
She's embarrassed

45:09.055 --> 45:11.254
by how she screwed up her life.

45:11.256 --> 45:12.723
They want to find her
and kill her?

45:12.725 --> 45:15.192
You, you must be exaggerating.

45:15.194 --> 45:16.527
It's a long story.

45:16.529 --> 45:19.230
She's a canary.
She sings.

45:19.232 --> 45:20.998
That's terrible.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.533
She's young.
She's pretty.

45:22.535 --> 45:24.301
She should go where she's safe.

45:24.303 --> 45:26.303
I asked you the other day
if she was pretty,

45:26.305 --> 45:27.872
and you said, "Okay."

45:27.874 --> 45:30.774
Eh, it was so quick.
I didn't really get a good look.

45:30.776 --> 45:33.344
But at the beach
she had on a bathing suit.

45:33.346 --> 45:35.379
Yeah.
Well, sort of.

45:35.381 --> 45:37.348
You didn't get any ideas,
did you?

45:37.350 --> 45:39.382
- What kind of ideas?
- What do you think?

45:39.384 --> 45:41.719
Hey, will you give me a break?
What're you doing?

45:41.721 --> 45:44.989
She's not for you.
She's hiding out here.

45:44.991 --> 45:46.957
Her life's all topsy-turvy.

45:46.959 --> 45:48.759
I was just chatting with her.

45:48.761 --> 45:51.462
Well, I hope you didn't
say anything about us.

45:51.464 --> 45:53.096
You know,
she'll tell her father.

45:53.098 --> 45:54.832
That's what canaries do.
They sing.

45:54.834 --> 45:57.401
Of course I'm not gonna do that.
What do you think, I'm a dope?

45:57.403 --> 45:58.736
Let's get off this topic.

45:58.738 --> 46:01.439
Hey, you were in my dream
last night.

46:01.441 --> 46:02.906
Yeah?

46:02.908 --> 46:06.410
What, I'm supposed to be
flattered you dream of me?

46:06.412 --> 46:10.181
I rescued you in the dream.

46:10.183 --> 46:12.315
Rescue me.

46:12.317 --> 46:13.917
What can I tell you?

46:13.919 --> 46:16.154
I'm not going to tell Ginny
my real feelings.

46:16.156 --> 46:17.355
How could I?

46:17.357 --> 46:20.024
But I was taken with Carolina.

46:20.026 --> 46:21.792
Something hit me right off.

46:21.794 --> 46:25.228
The more I talked with her,
the more I was intrigued by her.

46:25.230 --> 46:28.466
I felt a buzz all day
after our encounter.

46:28.468 --> 46:30.500
I'd like to see her again,
but, obviously,

46:30.502 --> 46:33.404
I can't be honest with Ginny
about that.

46:33.406 --> 46:35.439
The last thing I wanna do
is hurt Ginny.

46:35.441 --> 46:38.009
Or wreck a good thing.

46:38.011 --> 46:40.911
Ginny's a very emotional woman.

46:40.913 --> 46:43.948
And how could I ever
explain things to Carolina?

46:43.950 --> 46:45.549
That's all I need.

46:45.551 --> 46:47.218
"Hey, I'm having an affair
with your stepmother

46:47.220 --> 46:50.124
who's cheating with me
on your father."

46:51.256 --> 46:53.457
<i>It's best
to forget about Carolina.</i>

46:53.459 --> 46:56.430
<i>A sweet dream,
but a dream.</i>

46:57.529 --> 47:00.031
<i>But, as in a Greek play,</i>
Ananke, <i>or fate,</i>

47:00.033 --> 47:01.832
<i>rules so much of our destinies.</i>

47:01.834 --> 47:03.968
<i>First,
I accidentally drop my book,</i>

47:03.970 --> 47:05.669
<i>just missing her head,</i>

47:05.671 --> 47:07.872
<i>and now look what happens.</i>

47:12.745 --> 47:14.614
Oh.

47:18.151 --> 47:20.083
- Carolina!
- Huh?

47:20.085 --> 47:22.388
- Come on, get in!
- Oh.

47:24.857 --> 47:27.692
Thank you.
God, I was getting soaked.

47:27.694 --> 47:29.426
Let me buy you
a cup of coffee.

47:29.428 --> 47:31.562
I can't.
I'll be late for work.

47:31.564 --> 47:33.964
I'll get you as close
to the boardwalk as I can.

47:33.966 --> 47:36.167
Okay.

47:40.038 --> 47:41.839
I knew what was going on,

47:41.841 --> 47:45.576
but you look the other way
when you're husband's hot stuff

47:45.578 --> 47:47.978
and 6 million women
are after him,

47:47.980 --> 47:49.580
but he wants you,

47:49.582 --> 47:52.415
and it's all jewelry
and furs and Florida

47:52.417 --> 47:54.585
and the racetrack,
and the Copa,

47:54.587 --> 47:57.420
and the roulette wheel in Cuba.
It's...

47:57.422 --> 48:00.257
Wow, you've really lived a life.

48:00.259 --> 48:02.026
It was great.

48:02.028 --> 48:03.694
Until it wasn't.

48:03.696 --> 48:05.997
And then it was a lot of arguing

48:05.999 --> 48:07.801
and getting pushed around.

48:09.401 --> 48:12.036
What'd you,
uh, what'd you argue over?

48:12.038 --> 48:15.475
Just sooner or later,
everything.

48:16.808 --> 48:20.948
It sounds exciting,
but it's an unreal way to live.

48:22.147 --> 48:24.915
I want a family,
and, and I wanted peace.

48:24.917 --> 48:27.317
So eventually,
the whole thing blew up

48:27.319 --> 48:29.786
and we split,

48:29.788 --> 48:33.658
but the FBI got to me
and I...

48:33.660 --> 48:37.294
I was all mixed up and scared
and I said things.

48:37.296 --> 48:39.663
Because I know things.

48:39.665 --> 48:43.636
So they hate me,
and, uh, they're scared.

48:47.272 --> 48:49.573
I know where
all the bodies are buried.

48:49.575 --> 48:53.009
Jesus, what a sheltered life
I have led.

48:53.011 --> 48:57.515
I have book knowledge,
but you've really tasted life.

48:57.517 --> 48:59.917
You've been around the world.

48:59.919 --> 49:02.986
Yeah, but you've been
around the block.

49:02.988 --> 49:05.922
You think you'll always
be looking over your shoulder?

49:05.924 --> 49:07.424
Everybody dies.

49:07.426 --> 49:09.695
You can't walk around
thinking about it.

49:10.462 --> 49:12.228
You're talking to a lifeguard.

49:12.230 --> 49:15.299
And hopefully with time,
things change.

49:15.301 --> 49:16.933
I-I get paid to save people.

49:16.935 --> 49:19.236
You know, you'd be safe
in a place like Venice

49:19.238 --> 49:22.073
or... or Bora Bora.

49:22.075 --> 49:24.942
That's where I'm headed.

49:24.944 --> 49:27.044
I'm gonna be late.

49:27.046 --> 49:30.147
I'm really flattered
you opened up to me.

49:30.149 --> 49:32.350
You have a kind face.

49:32.352 --> 49:34.752
And you have a beautiful face,

49:34.754 --> 49:37.487
especially in this rain light.

49:37.489 --> 49:39.589
Thank you for the lift.

49:39.591 --> 49:41.192
I hope I didn't make you late.

49:41.194 --> 49:43.326
No, it's okay.

49:43.328 --> 49:45.629
I'm glad I took you up
on the ride.

49:45.631 --> 49:48.031
Bye.

49:54.774 --> 49:56.373
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

49:56.375 --> 49:57.774
I got caught in the storm.

49:57.776 --> 49:59.143
I'll explain it all
to you later.

49:59.145 --> 50:00.710
I want your input.

50:00.712 --> 50:02.645
Well, I can't do
all the work here by myself.

50:02.647 --> 50:04.647
I-I got a migraine,
wouldn't you know it.

50:04.649 --> 50:06.216
Oh, it's the weather.

50:06.218 --> 50:08.551
Well, get... but next time
get here on time.

50:08.553 --> 50:10.221
I don't want to have
to cover for you.

50:10.223 --> 50:11.821
I'm usually very punctual.

50:11.823 --> 50:13.623
"Usually" doesn't do it.
This is a job.

50:13.625 --> 50:15.493
I know you're not
used to schedules.

50:15.495 --> 50:17.661
Lucky Tiny's not here.

50:17.663 --> 50:20.631
Can I talk to you
later when you're not so...

50:20.633 --> 50:22.600
- when you're feeling better?
- About what?

50:22.602 --> 50:24.435
Just some advice
when you're not so stressed.

50:24.437 --> 50:26.437
Would you stop doing that
with your fingers?

50:26.439 --> 50:28.739
- It would... it would help.
- Oh, it's when I get excited.

50:28.741 --> 50:31.776
Look, I'm... my head's throbbing,
I-I had to do six tables alone,

50:31.778 --> 50:33.877
I broke my neck
for two fat ladies,

50:33.879 --> 50:35.779
and don't you know,
they stiffed me.

50:35.781 --> 50:36.814
Hey!

50:36.816 --> 50:38.848
I am very sorry I'm late.

50:40.520 --> 50:43.053
But I was shopping, and when
I came out it was raining,

50:43.055 --> 50:45.756
and you may have forgotten,
but today is a special day,

50:45.758 --> 50:47.558
and I wanted to get it
gift wrapped for you.

50:47.560 --> 50:50.794
God, don't tell me
you got me a present.

50:50.796 --> 50:53.330
How often do you turn 40?
It's a milestone!

50:53.332 --> 50:55.433
It's a tombstone.

50:55.435 --> 50:57.504
You're not getting it
till tonight.

50:58.504 --> 51:01.038
Can we order some clams?

51:01.040 --> 51:02.440
Uh, yeah.
Hey.

51:02.442 --> 51:04.341
Yeah.

51:04.343 --> 51:06.109
Hi.

51:06.111 --> 51:07.977
You can sit wherever you'd like.

51:07.979 --> 51:11.882
I can't believe it's my birthday
and we can't be together.

51:11.884 --> 51:15.088
I know Humpty's
got something planned.

51:15.955 --> 51:19.256
I don't need any present,
but I wouldn't mind dinner

51:19.258 --> 51:21.828
someplace over candlelight.

51:22.828 --> 51:25.462
You've got a birthday
coming up too.

51:25.464 --> 51:27.297
I love that we're both Leos.

51:27.299 --> 51:30.533
Leos are warm, generous,
protective,

51:30.535 --> 51:32.136
beautiful.

51:32.138 --> 51:34.772
Oh, God,
I'm, I'm not beautiful tonight.

51:34.774 --> 51:36.473
- I got this...
- Here you go.

51:36.475 --> 51:37.875
I got this migraine.

51:37.877 --> 51:39.243
Can I get you
anything else?

51:39.245 --> 51:41.544
I gotta go.

51:41.546 --> 51:43.180
I love you, Mickey.

51:45.218 --> 51:47.587
There you go.
I said it.

51:48.788 --> 51:51.191
- I'm coming.
- I gotta go.

51:53.692 --> 51:56.292
And we wish you
a happy birthday.

51:56.294 --> 51:57.661
Happy birthday!

51:57.663 --> 51:58.995
Happy birthday, Ginny.

51:58.997 --> 52:00.897
And don't be depressed
over turning 40.

52:00.899 --> 52:02.665
Hang onto it
because take it from me,

52:02.667 --> 52:04.301
in a blink of an eye,
you're gonna be 50...

52:04.303 --> 52:06.169
- That's true.
- You're gonna wish you were 40.

52:06.171 --> 52:08.739
Come on, let me do it,
let me do it, let me do it.

52:08.741 --> 52:10.306
Come on,
you already sung into it.

52:10.308 --> 52:12.243
It's a tape recorder.
It's a tape recorder.

52:12.245 --> 52:13.544
This is an unbelievable machine.

52:13.546 --> 52:15.078
Yeah, yeah, well, you know,

52:15.080 --> 52:17.580
I thought she'd like it
for her birthday.

52:17.582 --> 52:19.917
I got a great buy
on that tape recorder.

52:19.919 --> 52:22.620
- It's stolen.
- What do you mean "stolen"?

52:22.622 --> 52:24.922
Ah, some bum stole it.

52:24.924 --> 52:27.725
He was trying to sell it
on the boardwalk, you know.

52:27.727 --> 52:28.993
Big spender.

52:28.995 --> 52:30.895
Yeah, those guys will,
you know...

52:30.897 --> 52:34.330
They'll do anything
to make money to buy a drink.

52:34.332 --> 52:35.533
- So will I.
- Yeah.

52:36.801 --> 52:38.569
I paid three bucks for it.

52:38.571 --> 52:40.069
- $3?
- I mean, I couldn't afford

52:40.071 --> 52:41.839
- a new one, right?
- That's a deal.

52:41.841 --> 52:43.640
- I think so.
- That's a lot of fun,

52:43.642 --> 52:45.174
- isn't it, Ginny?
- Oh, sure.

52:45.176 --> 52:46.944
I wish I had
one of these things.

52:46.946 --> 52:48.812
- It's great.
- What kind of birthday party

52:48.814 --> 52:51.015
- is this with no booze?
- Oh, shut up, Ryan.

52:51.017 --> 52:52.382
Hey, come on,
it's a party.

52:52.384 --> 52:53.750
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

52:58.457 --> 53:00.658
Hey, wait, no, no.

53:00.660 --> 53:02.960
If you're gonna sing, will you
at least get the words right?

53:02.962 --> 53:04.727
Those are the right words.

53:04.729 --> 53:06.430
"She loved the sailor
and he loved her too."

53:06.432 --> 53:08.632
You know what?
I think it's time to go home.

53:08.634 --> 53:10.868
- No, no.
- It's early, come on.

53:10.870 --> 53:12.770
Now, you know what,
you should come out

53:12.772 --> 53:14.538
on the boat on Saturday.
They're going for bluefish.

53:14.540 --> 53:16.507
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Ah, she don't fish.

53:16.509 --> 53:18.808
Well, neither do I,
but she can get a nice tan.

53:18.810 --> 53:21.111
She don't do nothin'.
Come on, don't go.

53:21.113 --> 53:24.515
Stay, stay. Come on.

53:27.886 --> 53:30.420
Oh, look, it lights up

53:30.422 --> 53:32.288
- when he's singing there.
- Isn't that nice?

53:32.290 --> 53:33.723
Yeah, I love that.

53:33.725 --> 53:35.426
Come on, wait.
Keep on going.

53:38.863 --> 53:40.964
That's it.

53:43.069 --> 53:45.502
Come on.
What do you mean, he was three?

53:52.645 --> 53:54.712
Hi, are you okay?

53:54.714 --> 53:58.114
Yeah, my head's cracking open.

53:58.116 --> 54:00.718
I'm glad you liked the scarf.
It looks great on you.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.886
Oh, thanks.

54:02.888 --> 54:06.290
Jesus, are they ever
going home?

54:06.292 --> 54:08.859
Ugh, my sixth aspirin.

54:08.861 --> 54:11.027
Hey, what did you want
to ask me about?

54:11.029 --> 54:12.962
Oh, it can wait.
I just wanted to get your advice

54:12.964 --> 54:15.167
on something concerning Mickey.

54:16.267 --> 54:18.335
- Mickey the lifeguard?
- Uh-huh.

54:18.337 --> 54:19.803
But it can wait.

54:19.805 --> 54:22.475
No, go ahead.
What about Mickey?

54:23.475 --> 54:27.710
I ran into him today in the rain
and he gave me a lift.

54:27.712 --> 54:30.114
He did?

54:30.116 --> 54:32.518
Lucky me.
I would have been soaked.

54:33.151 --> 54:36.152
Well, he just happened
to drive by?

54:36.154 --> 54:39.623
Yeah, and we got
a chance to talk,

54:39.625 --> 54:42.026
and I really think
there's something there.

54:42.028 --> 54:44.127
Like what?

54:44.129 --> 54:48.165
Well, he was very charming
and flirtatious.

54:48.167 --> 54:50.299
And he liked hearing
all about me.

54:50.301 --> 54:52.770
I must say,
I found him very appealing.

54:52.772 --> 54:54.937
Hey.

54:54.939 --> 54:57.107
What're youse doing?

54:57.109 --> 54:59.710
Why don't you come join us?
Y-y-you can sing.

54:59.712 --> 55:01.078
You know "April Showers," right?

55:01.080 --> 55:04.448
- We're just talking, Dad.
- Oh.

55:04.450 --> 55:08.585
Aw, baby, I didn't get a chance
to give you your birthday kiss.

55:08.587 --> 55:10.353
Come on.

55:10.355 --> 55:13.323
You know,
you're just as pretty today

55:13.325 --> 55:17.326
as you were
when I first started dating you.

55:17.328 --> 55:19.830
I'm a lucky guy.

55:19.832 --> 55:21.698
Come on, join us.

55:21.700 --> 55:23.466
We will.

55:23.468 --> 55:25.768
What makes you think
he liked hearing your story?

55:25.770 --> 55:27.036
Did he say anything?

55:27.038 --> 55:28.906
He was clearly flirty.

55:28.908 --> 55:32.141
- Yeah, it was obvious?
- Mm-hmm.

55:32.143 --> 55:35.344
And we were sitting in the car
in the rain.

55:35.346 --> 55:37.948
It was like being
in one of those love pictures.

55:37.950 --> 55:39.348
Well, how far'd it go?

55:39.350 --> 55:40.783
Did he take your hand
or anything?

55:40.785 --> 55:42.419
No, we just talked,

55:42.421 --> 55:45.823
and I told him all about Frank
and my marriage,

55:45.825 --> 55:48.058
and he found the whole story
dramatic.

55:48.060 --> 55:51.294
You opened up
to a guy you just met?

55:51.296 --> 55:52.995
I know.
I...

55:52.997 --> 55:56.065
I found myself
talking and talking.

55:56.067 --> 55:58.701
Oh, it's funny.
I...

55:58.703 --> 56:00.370
I felt very at ease with him.

56:00.372 --> 56:02.172
Even when I first met him.

56:02.174 --> 56:04.475
Well, did he become familiar?
I mean, did he try anything?

56:04.477 --> 56:05.712
Did he take your hand?

56:06.479 --> 56:09.980
He said I had a beautiful face
in the rain light.

56:09.982 --> 56:12.750
Isn't that a nice phrase,
"The rain light"?

56:12.752 --> 56:14.183
He's a poet.

56:14.185 --> 56:16.886
Uh-huh, and did he
take your hand?

56:16.888 --> 56:19.056
Christ, did he do anything?

56:19.058 --> 56:20.991
Did he touch you?
Did, did he kiss you?

56:20.993 --> 56:22.692
Why are you getting so heated?

56:22.694 --> 56:25.294
Well, it's,
it's like pulling teeth.

56:25.296 --> 56:28.364
God, between you and them
and my, my headache.

56:28.366 --> 56:30.399
Well, I told you
that this could wait.

56:30.401 --> 56:32.736
Just continue.

56:32.738 --> 56:35.138
He didn't touch me.

56:35.140 --> 56:37.440
I'm telling you because
I probably over-interpreted it

56:37.442 --> 56:40.076
because I-I wanted him to.

56:40.078 --> 56:43.446
But that's why I'm asking you.
Because you know the guy.

56:43.448 --> 56:45.649
So, so what's he like?

56:45.651 --> 56:48.252
He's a loose talker.

56:48.254 --> 56:50.821
My advice is to watch yourself.

56:50.823 --> 56:52.422
Yeah, he fills your head
full of lies, but he...

56:52.424 --> 56:55.292
and his reputation
is that he's a phony.

56:55.294 --> 56:57.227
Really?

56:57.229 --> 56:59.596
But he, he didn't do anything?
I mean, he didn't kiss you?

56:59.598 --> 57:02.366
- Unless you're not telling me.
- Why wouldn't I tell you?

57:02.368 --> 57:04.301
Then I say forget him.

57:04.303 --> 57:06.435
I happen to know
he's got a girlfriend

57:06.437 --> 57:07.904
who he's in love with,

57:07.906 --> 57:10.473
and maybe even plans to marry.

57:10.475 --> 57:13.710
So my, my advice is,
is to keep away.

57:13.712 --> 57:15.879
That's disappointing.

57:15.881 --> 57:18.815
Well, honey, he'll,
he'll break your heart.

57:18.817 --> 57:21.417
You know, is that what you want?

57:21.419 --> 57:23.120
Are you sure?

57:23.122 --> 57:26.056
Men can't be trusted.

57:26.058 --> 57:27.658
I should talk.

57:27.660 --> 57:29.660
My husband trusted me
and I...

57:29.662 --> 57:32.161
I hurt him.
I wrecked him.

57:32.163 --> 57:34.631
I'm not sure he didn't kill
himself in some hotel room

57:34.633 --> 57:36.600
in, in Philadelphia.

57:36.602 --> 57:38.035
I-I don't wanna know about it.

57:38.037 --> 57:39.837
If he decides
to take 90 sleeping pills

57:39.839 --> 57:41.605
or 85, I'm sup...
I'm supposed to...

57:41.607 --> 57:43.373
supposed to blame myself.

57:43.375 --> 57:45.808
Christ,
can they get the hell out?

57:47.145 --> 57:48.879
Calm down, Ginny.
They're leaving.

57:48.881 --> 57:50.379
I know him,

57:50.381 --> 57:52.882
and I know him
well enough to know

57:52.884 --> 57:55.118
you're not his type,

57:55.120 --> 57:57.855
and he...
honey, he's taken.

57:57.857 --> 58:00.489
He's not free.

58:00.491 --> 58:02.859
Okay.

58:02.861 --> 58:04.895
That's why I asked you.

58:04.897 --> 58:07.998
Come here, Richie.
Come say good-bye.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.632
- See you later, kiddo.
- Bye.

58:09.634 --> 58:11.969
- It was great to see you.
- Bye, sweetheart.

58:11.971 --> 58:14.638
- Ginny, Ginny!
- Bye.

58:14.640 --> 58:16.806
Happy birthday.

58:18.910 --> 58:20.810
I didn't mean
to bother you with this.

58:20.812 --> 58:22.913
Why don't you lie down?

58:22.915 --> 58:25.015
Just because you're
a pretty young girl,

58:25.017 --> 58:27.516
who's been pampered
and chased after,

58:27.518 --> 58:30.386
you think every man
is a pushover.

58:30.388 --> 58:32.154
Why are you saying that?

58:32.156 --> 58:34.491
- What did I do?
- Well, it's true isn't it?

58:34.493 --> 58:36.192
Car and drivers.

58:36.194 --> 58:38.661
You know,
winters in Palm Beach.

58:38.663 --> 58:40.533
God, who you kidding.

58:41.966 --> 58:43.766
Hello?

58:43.768 --> 58:46.036
What?

58:46.038 --> 58:48.141
This is his mother.

58:51.542 --> 58:52.942
Where?

58:52.944 --> 58:54.881
When? Today?

58:55.781 --> 58:57.381
Well, was anybody hurt?

58:57.383 --> 58:59.852
But nobody got burned
or anything?

59:00.919 --> 59:02.488
N-no.

59:03.821 --> 59:05.691
No, I-I work then.

59:06.491 --> 59:08.457
Well, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, there,

59:08.459 --> 59:10.993
there's no, no reason
to involve the police.

59:10.995 --> 59:12.728
Yeah.

59:12.730 --> 59:14.131
Yes.

59:14.133 --> 59:15.698
I'll be there.

59:15.700 --> 59:18.535
9:30, uh-huh.
Thank you.

59:20.805 --> 59:23.006
Put away that goddamn machine!

59:23.008 --> 59:24.241
What I do?

59:24.243 --> 59:26.208
You know what you did!

59:26.210 --> 59:29.779
You made a fire in the basement
of an apartment house!

59:29.781 --> 59:31.248
What the hell were you doing

59:31.250 --> 59:34.016
in the basement
of an apartment house?

59:34.018 --> 59:36.652
Listen to me!

59:36.654 --> 59:38.321
They were gonna call the police.

59:38.323 --> 59:39.989
We have to be see
the principal tomorrow.

59:39.991 --> 59:42.292
What is wrong with you?
Huh?

59:42.294 --> 59:44.560
You wanna,
you wanna kill somebody?

59:44.562 --> 59:46.730
You wanna burn yourself
to death?

59:46.732 --> 59:49.265
Ah, Jesus,
I can't take this close living.

59:49.267 --> 59:51.000
- What...
- Everything's coming apart.

59:51.002 --> 59:53.337
- What, what's wrong?
- What's wrong

59:53.339 --> 59:57.107
is one of these days he's
gonna kill someone with a fire.

59:57.109 --> 59:59.308
- You did it again?
- Oh, God.

59:59.310 --> 01:00:01.978
Where'd you get the sick habit
to make fires?

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:03.946
- Are you demented?
- You know what?

01:00:03.948 --> 01:00:05.448
I swear, I catch you
with matches again,

01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:07.083
I'm gonna beat your brains out,

01:00:07.085 --> 01:00:08.451
and that goes
for your stealing too.

01:00:08.453 --> 01:00:10.120
Okay, we're too crowded here,

01:00:10.122 --> 01:00:11.687
and she's no help.

01:00:11.689 --> 01:00:13.089
You know, you spoiled her,

01:00:13.091 --> 01:00:14.824
her husband pampered her.

01:00:14.826 --> 01:00:16.393
She's no good
in the restaurant.

01:00:16.395 --> 01:00:18.794
Let her go to Mexico
where she's safe.

01:00:18.796 --> 01:00:20.196
Oh, she's right.
I'll get out.

01:00:20.198 --> 01:00:23.033
No.
No, you won't.

01:00:23.035 --> 01:00:24.968
Where the hell you gonna go?

01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:27.036
Business is off all over.

01:00:27.038 --> 01:00:29.071
Come on, we're broke.

01:00:29.073 --> 01:00:31.707
No, no, you're finally
going to school.

01:00:31.709 --> 01:00:34.310
You stay here till you get
your feet on the ground,

01:00:34.312 --> 01:00:35.846
and then you can go.
Look at...

01:00:35.848 --> 01:00:38.080
She's not happy
waiting on tables,

01:00:38.082 --> 01:00:40.716
and she's no good at it.

01:00:40.718 --> 01:00:42.152
All right.

01:00:42.154 --> 01:00:44.420
Let's do something
about the kid.

01:00:44.422 --> 01:00:45.821
You know what
I'm gonna do?

01:00:45.823 --> 01:00:47.556
I'm gonna take my strap off

01:00:47.558 --> 01:00:49.493
and I'm gonna teach you a lesson
you're never gonna forget.

01:00:49.495 --> 01:00:52.094
- Hey, don't you dare.
- He started the fire.

01:00:52.096 --> 01:00:53.462
How did this get to be about me?

01:00:53.464 --> 01:00:55.464
Why can't she find a job
somewhere else?

01:00:55.466 --> 01:00:57.734
Get a room and split the rent
with some girl.

01:00:57.736 --> 01:01:01.038
What're you... come on, she's...
she's trying to go to school.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.571
She's trying to make a life,
all right?

01:01:02.573 --> 01:01:05.408
She wants
to amount to something.

01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:08.411
She's not gonna spend the rest
of her life waiting tables.

01:01:08.413 --> 01:01:10.112
She's better than that.

01:01:10.114 --> 01:01:12.382
It's 'cause
you're too close to her.

01:01:12.384 --> 01:01:16.319
Honey, there's class
in this girl.

01:01:16.321 --> 01:01:18.487
She made a mistake, all right?

01:01:18.489 --> 01:01:20.556
And I swore
I'd never forgive her,

01:01:20.558 --> 01:01:23.759
but it's not in my nature
to stay angry, honey.

01:01:23.761 --> 01:01:26.096
And what about me?
Huh?

01:01:26.098 --> 01:01:28.131
I don't wanna
be a waitress either!

01:01:28.133 --> 01:01:30.167
There's more in me
than shucking oysters.

01:01:30.169 --> 01:01:32.636
You're upset, baby.
All right?

01:01:32.638 --> 01:01:34.737
Every birthday,
instead of celebrating,

01:01:34.739 --> 01:01:36.605
you put on a long face.
Come on, honey.

01:01:36.607 --> 01:01:39.910
Ah, God, what I really need
is a drink,

01:01:39.912 --> 01:01:42.846
but I can't have it 'cause
you'll fall off the wagon.

01:01:42.848 --> 01:01:44.915
Ugh, go to bed!

01:01:44.917 --> 01:01:47.049
- Go to bed!
- Hey!

01:01:49.821 --> 01:01:52.457
- Ugh.
- What the hell?

01:01:56.127 --> 01:01:59.428
All right, here we go.

01:01:59.430 --> 01:02:03.265
Hi, is the same time next
Thursday okay for you?

01:02:03.267 --> 01:02:06.303
I work.
I'll have to call you.

01:02:06.305 --> 01:02:08.437
- He may have to come alone.
- Oh, that's fine.

01:02:08.439 --> 01:02:09.940
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:02:09.942 --> 01:02:12.278
- Thank you.
- Sure.

01:02:13.312 --> 01:02:16.178
- How'd you like her?
- She was okay.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.281
- Well, what'd she say?
- Nothing.

01:02:19.283 --> 01:02:20.817
Well, I'm sure
she didn't say nothing.

01:02:20.819 --> 01:02:23.886
- She asked a few questions.
- Like what?

01:02:23.888 --> 01:02:26.256
- I don't know.
- Tell me.

01:02:26.258 --> 01:02:28.290
I don't remember.

01:02:28.292 --> 01:02:31.428
About my father and you
and Humpty.

01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:33.864
And then what'd you say?

01:02:33.866 --> 01:02:35.966
I don't remember.

01:02:35.968 --> 01:02:37.868
Did you tell her I love you?

01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:39.536
Did you tell her
I screwed up your life

01:02:39.538 --> 01:02:41.237
by betraying your father?

01:02:41.239 --> 01:02:43.940
Huh?
What'd she say to that?

01:02:43.942 --> 01:02:45.975
She must have
a pretty low opinion of me.

01:02:45.977 --> 01:02:49.245
I told her that it's your fault
my real father's gone.

01:02:49.247 --> 01:02:51.348
Where'd you get that from?

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:54.951
You just said it.
You say it all the time.

01:02:54.953 --> 01:02:58.524
I told her it makes you cry
and you think you hear drums.

01:03:00.259 --> 01:03:03.859
Hey, humpty.
Humpty.

01:03:03.861 --> 01:03:06.163
He, he has to see this doctor.

01:03:06.165 --> 01:03:08.198
He has to see this doctor
once a week.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.232
We need an extra $10 a week.

01:03:10.234 --> 01:03:12.301
Don't look at me.
You see how business is.

01:03:12.303 --> 01:03:14.270
Well, don't look
at me either.

01:03:14.272 --> 01:03:16.172
- You have some money saved.
- What money?

01:03:16.174 --> 01:03:18.942
Oh, God, plenty of money
from when you hit you number,

01:03:18.944 --> 01:03:21.377
and since Carolina came,
you put away a few dollars

01:03:21.379 --> 01:03:23.480
from your paycheck every week,
and you have some,

01:03:23.482 --> 01:03:25.382
some money left
from selling the car.

01:03:25.384 --> 01:03:28.618
Uh, listen, that,
that's for her school, okay?

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:31.053
- She earns money.
- What, Ruby's?

01:03:31.055 --> 01:03:32.522
She makes peanuts.
Come on.

01:03:32.524 --> 01:03:34.558
You, you got plenty
in that tin box,

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.093
and I-I need to pay
the psychiatrist.

01:03:37.095 --> 01:03:39.328
I don't believe
in any of that crap.

01:03:39.330 --> 01:03:41.031
You know, you just gotta
be stricter with him.

01:03:41.033 --> 01:03:44.033
I-I've said it a dozen times.

01:03:44.035 --> 01:03:47.036
I-I need some extra money, okay?

01:03:47.038 --> 01:03:49.239
He, he needs help.

01:03:49.241 --> 01:03:53.542
Well, for what?
What about my daughter?

01:03:53.544 --> 01:03:55.611
All right, I'm not gonna
throw away her future

01:03:55.613 --> 01:03:57.580
to pay for some
phony head doctor.

01:03:57.582 --> 01:04:01.451
That's the biggest
goddamn racket.

01:04:01.453 --> 01:04:03.219
What with the cigarettes?

01:04:03.221 --> 01:04:05.557
I'm smoking.
I'm smoking.

01:04:07.058 --> 01:04:09.759
Ginny, come on.

01:04:09.761 --> 01:04:13.129
Coney's on the skids.
We don't raise enough to live.

01:04:13.131 --> 01:04:15.598
Honey, honey,
I don't blame you for...

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:19.368
being moody.
I know you're moody.

01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:21.571
Okay.

01:04:21.573 --> 01:04:24.174
You know, I-I don't get it.

01:04:24.176 --> 01:04:27.176
You're happy one minute

01:04:27.178 --> 01:04:29.411
and then you get crazy.

01:04:29.413 --> 01:04:32.882
You pick fights with Carolina
for no good goddamn reason.

01:04:32.884 --> 01:04:35.085
She likes you.
Look at me.

01:04:35.087 --> 01:04:37.256
She likes you.

01:04:39.191 --> 01:04:41.091
Come on.

01:04:41.093 --> 01:04:43.426
What happened to us, huh?

01:04:43.428 --> 01:04:45.361
We used to talk
to each other more.

01:04:45.363 --> 01:04:47.096
We used to go fishing together.

01:04:47.098 --> 01:04:48.698
- What...
- Your problem is

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:50.699
you're wrapped up in Carolina.
I told you that.

01:04:50.701 --> 01:04:52.801
You scrimp and save for her.
You take her fishing with you.

01:04:52.803 --> 01:04:54.571
You get angry
if she goes on a date.

01:04:54.573 --> 01:04:57.473
And face it, Humpty,
you treat her like a girlfriend.

01:04:57.475 --> 01:04:59.776
You're gonna be crushed
when she dumps you again,

01:04:59.778 --> 01:05:03.045
and she, she will dump you,
and move on.

01:05:03.047 --> 01:05:05.315
You know what?

01:05:05.317 --> 01:05:08.321
I cannot have
this conversation anymore.

01:05:09.988 --> 01:05:12.522
You got a one-track mind,

01:05:12.524 --> 01:05:15.460
and you've become insulting!

01:05:22.433 --> 01:05:24.933
You remembered I loved it here.

01:05:24.935 --> 01:05:27.036
Here.
Here's your present.

01:05:27.038 --> 01:05:29.506
Happy birthday.

01:05:29.508 --> 01:05:31.674
It's obviously a book.

01:05:31.676 --> 01:05:33.412
Open it.

01:05:34.979 --> 01:05:36.645
<i>The Plays of Eugene O'Neill.</i>

01:05:36.647 --> 01:05:38.614
You'll like them.
They're dark.

01:05:38.616 --> 01:05:40.516
And he really knew the score.

01:05:40.518 --> 01:05:42.484
You know, human nature
and existence.

01:05:42.486 --> 01:05:44.587
I once acted
in a play of his.

01:05:44.589 --> 01:05:45.955
Which?
I know them all.

01:05:45.957 --> 01:05:47.390
It was just summer stock.

01:05:47.392 --> 01:05:48.824
They did, uh,
<i>The Iceman Cometh.</i>

01:05:48.826 --> 01:05:50.292
I-I played
one of the whores.

01:05:50.294 --> 01:05:51.794
What power.

01:05:51.796 --> 01:05:53.730
To write a play
about the human condition,

01:05:53.732 --> 01:05:55.998
the tragic human condition.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.337
How we have to lie to ourselves
in order to live.

01:06:00.138 --> 01:06:03.676
Anyhow,
happy 40th.

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.980
Carolina says
you were flirting with her.

01:06:11.982 --> 01:06:14.183
Flirting?

01:06:14.185 --> 01:06:16.453
I gave her a lift in the rain.

01:06:16.455 --> 01:06:18.487
You don't have to lie.

01:06:18.489 --> 01:06:20.589
She said you parked
and had a long talk.

01:06:20.591 --> 01:06:22.192
A flirtatious talk.

01:06:22.194 --> 01:06:24.727
Did she get the impression
that I was flirting?

01:06:24.729 --> 01:06:28.797
Uh, Jesus, I mean, I was
fascinated by her story.

01:06:28.799 --> 01:06:31.468
This girl's lived a lifetime
in her 26 years.

01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:33.402
Did you make a pass at her?

01:06:33.404 --> 01:06:35.471
A pass?
God, no.

01:06:35.473 --> 01:06:37.339
I gave her a lift.

01:06:37.341 --> 01:06:39.174
Did you tell her she had
a beautiful face

01:06:39.176 --> 01:06:40.745
in the rain light?

01:06:41.413 --> 01:06:43.747
I don't remember.
I-I may have,

01:06:43.749 --> 01:06:47.250
but what's wrong
with a compliment?

01:06:47.252 --> 01:06:49.319
You know she's a marked woman.

01:06:49.321 --> 01:06:51.221
I-I do.
She told me her story.

01:06:51.223 --> 01:06:52.756
It's chilling.

01:06:52.758 --> 01:06:55.257
Would you like
to spend more time with her?

01:06:55.259 --> 01:06:57.359
Why do you say that?

01:06:57.361 --> 01:06:59.129
Well, that's
the impression she got.

01:06:59.131 --> 01:07:02.464
Look, this is supposed
to be your birthday celebration,

01:07:02.466 --> 01:07:04.768
and it's turning into
the third degree.

01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:07.569
Can't you see I'm jealous?

01:07:07.571 --> 01:07:09.906
Nothing's happened
to be jealous of.

01:07:09.908 --> 01:07:13.542
I was hoping we might have
a future together.

01:07:13.544 --> 01:07:15.645
Yes, I know.

01:07:15.647 --> 01:07:18.547
I told you we'd talk about it
when the time comes.

01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:20.549
If you told her
she had a beautiful face,

01:07:20.551 --> 01:07:22.451
what the hell is,
is she supposed to think?

01:07:22.453 --> 01:07:23.852
What the hell
am I supposed to think?

01:07:23.854 --> 01:07:25.654
Hey, we were sitting in the car

01:07:25.656 --> 01:07:27.290
on a rainy day.

01:07:27.292 --> 01:07:29.558
That light would have
looked soft on any woman.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.960
You know what?
This conversation

01:07:30.962 --> 01:07:32.694
is starting to take
a crazy turn.

01:07:32.696 --> 01:07:35.433
I've become consumed
with jealousy.

01:07:37.201 --> 01:07:39.935
Can we start the day over?

01:07:39.937 --> 01:07:42.439
I really hope you like
your birthday present.

01:07:42.441 --> 01:07:44.973
O'Neill was a great one.

01:07:44.975 --> 01:07:47.312
Great and terrifying.

01:07:48.212 --> 01:07:51.480
<i>Of course I felt terrible.</i>

01:07:51.482 --> 01:07:53.082
<i>I needed
to talk the situation over</i>

01:07:53.084 --> 01:07:55.718
<i>with someone
a lot sharper than me.</i>

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.719
<i>I called my friend Jake Jacoby</i>

01:07:57.721 --> 01:07:59.855
<i>who's a graduate student
at City College</i>

01:07:59.857 --> 01:08:01.757
<i>in the philosophy department.</i>

01:08:01.759 --> 01:08:05.661
It doesn't make sense because
you're not dealing with sense.

01:08:05.663 --> 01:08:08.231
You're dealing with feelings.

01:08:08.233 --> 01:08:09.833
Feelings, my friend,

01:08:09.835 --> 01:08:11.567
it's a whole different
ball game.

01:08:11.569 --> 01:08:15.271
The whole thing
is so irrational.

01:08:15.273 --> 01:08:17.841
I've been seeing
this married woman all summer,

01:08:17.843 --> 01:08:19.642
and she has these fantasies

01:08:19.644 --> 01:08:22.911
of leaving her husband
and going away with me.

01:08:22.912 --> 01:08:27.149
Her fondest wish would be
to divorce him and marry me.

01:08:27.152 --> 01:08:30.085
And at times I see it

01:08:30.087 --> 01:08:32.555
and at times I don't.

01:08:32.557 --> 01:08:36.524
She's older than me,
and I like that.

01:08:36.527 --> 01:08:38.627
Somehow it fits into
the romantic narrative

01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:41.462
of the writer's life.

01:08:43.167 --> 01:08:45.466
But she's more than that.

01:08:45.469 --> 01:08:48.170
So, so, so,
why am I hesitant?

01:08:48.171 --> 01:08:50.106
One minute I'm not sure,
the next I'm ready

01:08:50.108 --> 01:08:52.908
to take charge of her life,
to rescue her.

01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:55.978
Can, can this Carolina
be relied on?

01:08:55.979 --> 01:08:58.981
After all, she, she did
run away with gangsters

01:08:58.983 --> 01:09:00.984
because she was
a thrill-seeker.

01:09:00.986 --> 01:09:05.691
You know, did, did,
did she learn her lesson?

01:09:06.691 --> 01:09:09.325
She may give you
a period of bliss,

01:09:09.327 --> 01:09:11.660
but will it sustain?

01:09:11.662 --> 01:09:14.229
Will this other one be

01:09:14.232 --> 01:09:16.466
a more solid fit for you?

01:09:16.468 --> 01:09:18.767
When I hear you say it,

01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:21.941
I think, "Yes, she would."

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:25.741
And, and Ginny's counting on me.
She's drowning.

01:09:25.743 --> 01:09:30.279
And she'd be eternally grateful
for a lifeline.

01:09:30.282 --> 01:09:32.048
And after all, you know,

01:09:32.050 --> 01:09:34.750
a love so intense
as hers is for you

01:09:34.752 --> 01:09:38.487
is a rare gift
to have bestowed on a man.

01:09:43.228 --> 01:09:45.594
It's amazing
how lucid things become

01:09:45.595 --> 01:09:47.564
when you get
an outside perspective.

01:09:47.566 --> 01:09:52.401
At that moment, a fog lifted
and my choice was obvious.

01:09:52.403 --> 01:09:54.303
Carolina was a lovely daydream,

01:09:54.305 --> 01:09:58.240
but reality with all its pros
and cons belonged to Ginny.

01:09:58.242 --> 01:10:01.476
All my silly schemes
to pursue Carolina seemed crazy,

01:10:01.478 --> 01:10:05.083
and I made the decision to never
entertain that pipe dream again.

01:10:06.318 --> 01:10:09.822
But, as Jake said, the heart
has its own hieroglyphics.

01:10:10.788 --> 01:10:12.555
Maybe he was right.

01:10:12.557 --> 01:10:14.591
Hi.

01:10:14.593 --> 01:10:17.060
I came to tell you something.

01:10:17.062 --> 01:10:19.395
- Oh, yeah?
- I thought of you yesterday.

01:10:19.397 --> 01:10:20.963
I know you mentioned
that you loved pizza,

01:10:20.965 --> 01:10:22.464
and somebody said he knew

01:10:22.466 --> 01:10:23.865
the greatest pizza place
in Brooklyn,

01:10:23.867 --> 01:10:25.534
and he took me there
and he was right.

01:10:25.536 --> 01:10:27.136
I thought you'd want
to know about it.

01:10:27.138 --> 01:10:29.638
- Your boyfriend took you?
- It's called Capri.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:32.008
It's a few blocks from the
boardwalk, not far from here.

01:10:32.010 --> 01:10:33.976
Will you let me take you there?

01:10:33.978 --> 01:10:36.878
I'm kind of busy
with school all week.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.018
Uh, is Friday night good?

01:10:42.053 --> 01:10:43.953
Friday I can do.

01:10:43.955 --> 01:10:46.356
And he's not my boyfriend.

01:11:06.243 --> 01:11:08.610
Good morning, ma'am.

01:11:08.612 --> 01:11:11.013
Good morning.
Do you still have it?

01:11:11.015 --> 01:11:12.984
Yes, I do.

01:11:14.586 --> 01:11:17.119
I've got the money.

01:11:17.121 --> 01:11:18.987
- Here.
- Great.

01:11:22.193 --> 01:11:24.427
Oh, wonderful.

01:11:24.429 --> 01:11:26.596
Can you take it in the back
and engrave it?

01:11:26.598 --> 01:11:28.964
Of course.
What do you want it to say?

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:25.353
I'm glad we could steal
these few minutes.

01:12:25.355 --> 01:12:27.423
No one'll see us
this end of the boardwalk.

01:12:27.425 --> 01:12:30.426
It's, it's so private.

01:12:30.428 --> 01:12:31.761
I wanted to talk to you.

01:12:31.763 --> 01:12:35.131
First, I wanna talk to you.

01:12:35.133 --> 01:12:36.499
Okay.

01:12:36.501 --> 01:12:40.902
Don't look so worried,
mine is a nice thing.

01:12:40.904 --> 01:12:43.175
What?

01:12:45.143 --> 01:12:46.709
Did you miss me?

01:12:46.711 --> 01:12:49.111
Well, you've been so busy
with your son and his school.

01:12:49.113 --> 01:12:51.047
Oh, God.
That's not what I asked you!

01:12:51.049 --> 01:12:52.981
- Did you miss me?
- Jesus, Ginny, take it easy.

01:12:52.983 --> 01:12:54.683
Well, you're always so evasive.

01:12:54.685 --> 01:12:57.686
You never wanna
talk about anything.

01:12:57.688 --> 01:13:01.490
Okay, okay, look, look, I don't
wanna get off to a bad start.

01:13:02.861 --> 01:13:05.828
Remember last week
it was my birthday?

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:08.964
- Yes.
- Well, today is yours.

01:13:08.966 --> 01:13:10.767
How'd you know?

01:13:10.769 --> 01:13:12.834
You mentioned it.

01:13:12.836 --> 01:13:15.504
Remember, we're both Leos?

01:13:15.506 --> 01:13:17.472
I mentioned it ages ago.

01:13:17.474 --> 01:13:19.741
What a memory.

01:13:19.743 --> 01:13:21.209
What is that?

01:13:21.211 --> 01:13:23.512
- I got you a present.
- No.

01:13:23.514 --> 01:13:26.218
Here.

01:13:34.759 --> 01:13:38.895
Oh, God.
Y-you, you can't do that.

01:13:38.897 --> 01:13:42.064
- Why not?
- It's not right.

01:13:42.066 --> 01:13:44.267
- You got me a gift.
- I know, but...

01:13:44.269 --> 01:13:46.701
What the hell?
I got you a book.

01:13:46.703 --> 01:13:48.137
This is...

01:13:48.139 --> 01:13:50.239
It's much too expensive.
I can't accept this.

01:13:50.241 --> 01:13:51.807
How would you know
it's so expensive?

01:13:51.809 --> 01:13:53.642
I've inquired
about this watch.

01:13:53.644 --> 01:13:55.777
- I was with you.
- Ginny...

01:13:55.779 --> 01:13:59.315
Okay, this is a $500 watch.

01:13:59.317 --> 01:14:01.083
But you always wanted
this watch.

01:14:01.085 --> 01:14:02.985
Yes, but it's much
too extravagant.

01:14:02.987 --> 01:14:04.954
- You can't afford this.
- That's my business.

01:14:04.956 --> 01:14:07.957
And even if you could, it's much
too extravagant given...

01:14:07.959 --> 01:14:09.691
Given what?
Given, given what?

01:14:09.693 --> 01:14:11.127
It's too much to spend on me.

01:14:11.129 --> 01:14:12.895
You shouldn't be
getting me jewelry.

01:14:12.897 --> 01:14:15.934
Why not?
Is it too meaningful?

01:14:16.568 --> 01:14:18.868
Oh, Christ, you inscribed it.

01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:21.603
Yeah, read it.

01:14:23.273 --> 01:14:25.807
Look...

01:14:25.809 --> 01:14:27.776
we have to have a talk.

01:14:27.778 --> 01:14:29.645
I thought you'd be excited.

01:14:29.647 --> 01:14:31.780
It's too much,
and I can't accept this watch.

01:14:31.782 --> 01:14:33.583
- Stop saying that!
- You can't be buying me

01:14:33.585 --> 01:14:35.517
a $500 watch.

01:14:35.519 --> 01:14:37.018
Look... why?

01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:38.454
You, you're always saying
what a,

01:14:38.456 --> 01:14:40.856
what a beautiful,
perfect summer it's been,

01:14:40.858 --> 01:14:42.892
and, and...

01:14:42.894 --> 01:14:45.494
It's not right
given the circumstances.

01:14:45.496 --> 01:14:46.896
What circumstances?

01:14:46.898 --> 01:14:48.297
What are the goddamn
circumstances?

01:14:48.299 --> 01:14:50.165
Okay, you're ready
to get very serious,

01:14:50.167 --> 01:14:52.334
and I'm just not ready.

01:14:52.336 --> 01:14:54.402
Something's happened.
Some... something's happened.

01:14:54.404 --> 01:14:56.806
Everything was, everything was
going so smoothly.

01:14:56.808 --> 01:14:58.140
Something's gone wrong.

01:14:58.142 --> 01:15:00.142
I don't want
to disappoint you.

01:15:00.144 --> 01:15:02.611
Look, you, you said
you loved me.

01:15:02.613 --> 01:15:04.817
Were you insincere?

01:15:05.849 --> 01:15:08.650
- It's not that I wasn't trying.
- What?

01:15:08.652 --> 01:15:10.253
Oh, Christ,
if you have to try...

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:12.053
- It's, it's not homework.
- I'm not saying

01:15:12.055 --> 01:15:15.624
I don't have real feelings
for you.

01:15:15.626 --> 01:15:17.525
Is it Carolina?

01:15:17.527 --> 01:15:20.596
Jesus Christ,
I hardly know Carolina.

01:15:20.598 --> 01:15:23.298
But you wanna get to know her,
and I should wait around

01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:25.601
- while you could try her out?
- Hey, I didn't say that.

01:15:25.603 --> 01:15:27.669
I didn't say that.
You're losing it.

01:15:27.671 --> 01:15:29.972
You know what?
You don't want it...

01:15:29.974 --> 01:15:31.574
...forget it.
Huh?

01:15:31.576 --> 01:15:32.909
Forget it!
Forget it!

01:15:32.911 --> 01:15:35.110
What the hell are you doing,
Ginny?

01:15:35.112 --> 01:15:38.347
- Are you crazy?
- Don't talk to me!

01:15:38.349 --> 01:15:40.149
All right, you little punk,

01:15:40.151 --> 01:15:41.950
Give me back that money
or I'm gonna kill you.

01:15:41.952 --> 01:15:43.218
Hey, wh-what's going on?

01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:44.686
I didn't take his money.

01:15:44.688 --> 01:15:45.922
Don't tell me you little thief,

01:15:45.924 --> 01:15:47.356
you're always stealing from me.

01:15:47.358 --> 01:15:49.057
He took 400 bucks
out of my tin box.

01:15:49.059 --> 01:15:50.692
- I did not!
- You know what?

01:15:50.694 --> 01:15:53.228
That's 400 bucks.
That's grand larceny.

01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:55.164
You know,
I oughta bang it outta ya.

01:15:55.166 --> 01:15:56.932
He didn't take it.

01:15:56.934 --> 01:15:58.868
Don't, don't be tellin' me
he didn't take it.

01:15:58.870 --> 01:16:00.268
You know, you're always
sticking up for him.

01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:01.937
That's why he is the way he is.

01:16:01.939 --> 01:16:03.306
Now you give me that money back.

01:16:03.308 --> 01:16:05.473
- I took it.
- Don't make up a story.

01:16:05.475 --> 01:16:08.313
I took the money,
not him.

01:16:09.746 --> 01:16:11.146
You took it?

01:16:11.148 --> 01:16:12.548
Yeah, I-I needed it

01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:15.017
to pay for a psychiatrist
for him.

01:16:15.019 --> 01:16:16.351
- What?
- That's right.

01:16:16.353 --> 01:16:17.986
They're, they're a lot of money,

01:16:17.988 --> 01:16:20.289
and, and he's been goin'
every few days.

01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:22.325
I-I didn't want to tell you.

01:16:22.327 --> 01:16:24.726
You took my savings

01:16:24.728 --> 01:16:26.294
to pay for a head doctor?

01:16:26.296 --> 01:16:29.432
- Look, he needs help.
- Yeah, you know what,

01:16:29.434 --> 01:16:31.400
I was saving that money
for Carolina's school.

01:16:31.402 --> 01:16:34.637
Well, she'll just have to put
some of her dreams on hold.

01:16:34.639 --> 01:16:36.105
I got a call from his doctor

01:16:36.107 --> 01:16:38.074
that he started a fire
in her waiting room.

01:16:38.076 --> 01:16:39.976
Richie, is that so?

01:16:39.978 --> 01:16:41.744
I don't wanna go back there.

01:16:41.746 --> 01:16:44.112
You know what, you steal,
what kind of example is that?

01:16:44.114 --> 01:16:45.280
- Jesus.
- Oh, God,

01:16:45.282 --> 01:16:46.781
I can't handle this now.

01:16:46.783 --> 01:16:48.551
Look, I'm, I'm late for work.

01:16:48.553 --> 01:16:51.587
I am sick of waiting on tables,
and kicking in my salary

01:16:51.589 --> 01:16:55.156
so that you can put away
your extra money for Carolina.

01:16:55.158 --> 01:16:58.393
Oh, God,
now my head is pounding.

01:16:58.395 --> 01:17:01.664
- So go take an aspirin.
- I don't want an aspirin.

01:17:01.666 --> 01:17:05.470
- I want a scotch!
- Take an aspirin!

01:17:07.237 --> 01:17:09.070
Je... so that's where
you've been hiding it?

01:17:09.072 --> 01:17:10.439
I knew you had a stash,

01:17:10.441 --> 01:17:12.107
and when I begged you
for a shot, you...

01:17:12.109 --> 01:17:13.842
when I needed it,
you wouldn't give it to me,

01:17:13.844 --> 01:17:15.977
- but when you need one, you...
- You're not allowed!

01:17:15.979 --> 01:17:17.445
I knew you had a bottle.
I knew it.

01:17:17.447 --> 01:17:18.814
Hi.
I'm late.

01:17:18.816 --> 01:17:20.149
I'm such a scatterbrain.

01:17:20.151 --> 01:17:22.317
I have a date
and I forgot my wallet.

01:17:22.319 --> 01:17:23.953
Uh, I'm meeting Mickey

01:17:23.955 --> 01:17:26.355
and I found
this great pizza place.

01:17:26.357 --> 01:17:28.089
It's his birthday,
so I'm treating.

01:17:28.091 --> 01:17:30.191
You're... what?
You're going with Mickey?

01:17:30.193 --> 01:17:31.627
Don't look so stunned.

01:17:31.629 --> 01:17:33.361
You introduced me to him,
remember?

01:17:33.363 --> 01:17:35.498
If he breaks my heart,
you're to blame.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.600
I know you warned me,
but...

01:17:37.602 --> 01:17:40.369
...I think he likes me,
and is sincere.

01:17:40.371 --> 01:17:41.971
Not that anything's
happened yet,

01:17:41.973 --> 01:17:44.073
but I'm hoping
tonight's the night.

01:17:44.075 --> 01:17:46.909
Yes.
I've gotta go.

01:17:46.911 --> 01:17:49.748
- Bye.
- Don't come home late.

01:17:51.515 --> 01:17:55.183
- What're you doing?
- I'm drinking.

01:17:55.185 --> 01:17:57.956
What does it look like
I'm doing?

01:18:59.349 --> 01:19:01.316
- Tiny?
- Yeah?

01:19:01.318 --> 01:19:03.151
Uh, the... those two guys
that were just here...

01:19:03.153 --> 01:19:04.453
Yeah, they were looking
for Carolina.

01:19:04.455 --> 01:19:06.222
How'd they know she worked here?

01:19:06.224 --> 01:19:07.957
- I don't know.
- Well, what'd you tell 'em?

01:19:07.959 --> 01:19:09.357
Nothing, I hope.

01:19:09.359 --> 01:19:10.993
They said they needed
to find her.

01:19:10.995 --> 01:19:12.695
I know she's having dinner
with some guy tonight

01:19:12.697 --> 01:19:14.562
at the Capri Pizzeria
up on Beach Walk.

01:19:14.564 --> 01:19:16.298
Oh, God,
I hope you didn't say that.

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:18.033
Yeah, I did.
Why, did I do wrong?

01:19:18.035 --> 01:19:19.567
- Something wrong?
- Oh, God.

01:19:19.569 --> 01:19:21.669
I have to make a phone call
before they get there.

01:19:21.671 --> 01:19:23.472
- Uh, phone's not...
- Capri, the Italian restaurant?

01:19:23.474 --> 01:19:25.141
Yeah, yeah, it's
not working though, the phone.

01:19:25.143 --> 01:19:26.542
What do you mean the phone's
not, not work...

01:19:26.544 --> 01:19:28.310
I don't know,
all day long.

01:19:28.312 --> 01:19:30.079
Oh, Jesus, I have to make,
make a phone call.

01:19:30.081 --> 01:19:32.362
- You need a nickel?
- I have to make a phone call.

01:19:34.484 --> 01:19:37.455
I-I have, have to make
an emergency call.

01:19:38.456 --> 01:19:40.856
All right, miss.
I-I gotta call you back.

01:19:40.858 --> 01:19:42.158
There's an emergency here.

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.525
Someone needs
to make a phone call.

01:19:43.527 --> 01:19:45.160
All right, yeah.
No, I'll call you back.

01:19:45.162 --> 01:19:47.163
Okay, thank you.

01:19:51.536 --> 01:19:53.601
Yeah, I need the number
of a-a restaurant in Brooklyn

01:19:53.603 --> 01:19:55.404
on Beach Walk
called Capri Pizzeria.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.676
What?

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.515
- Capri, John speaking.
<i>- Yeah, Capri?</i>

01:20:06.517 --> 01:20:09.552
Yeah, I-I need
to speak with a customer.

01:20:09.554 --> 01:20:13.391
She has, she has,
uh, she has blo... blond...

01:20:16.394 --> 01:20:19.197
<i>Hello?</i>

01:20:20.031 --> 01:20:22.167
<i>Hello?</i>

01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:26.670
<i>Capri.
Hello?</i>

01:20:45.922 --> 01:20:48.289
Isn't it the best pizza
you've ever had in your life?

01:20:48.291 --> 01:20:50.525
And I'm taking you.

01:20:50.527 --> 01:20:52.261
I have something
I wanna tell you.

01:20:52.263 --> 01:20:53.829
If only it wasn't
so fattening.

01:20:53.831 --> 01:20:55.631
But, of course, you don't have
to worry about that.

01:20:55.633 --> 01:20:58.767
A few things
that I wanna tell you.

01:20:58.769 --> 01:20:59.901
Yes?

01:20:59.903 --> 01:21:02.570
First...

01:21:02.572 --> 01:21:04.306
I'm in love with you.

01:21:04.308 --> 01:21:05.874
You'll think I'm very silly,

01:21:05.876 --> 01:21:08.977
but I believe firmly
in love at first sight.

01:21:08.979 --> 01:21:12.615
Maybe because I'm writer
and we over-romanticize,

01:21:12.617 --> 01:21:16.284
but you just rang
some sort of a bell with me

01:21:16.286 --> 01:21:18.387
the minute I laid eyes on you.

01:21:18.389 --> 01:21:20.859
I don't know what to say.

01:21:22.359 --> 01:21:24.392
I don't want you
to say anything.

01:21:24.394 --> 01:21:26.995
I don't expect you
to say anything,

01:21:26.997 --> 01:21:29.231
but I still wanted you to know.

01:21:29.233 --> 01:21:31.770
I'm glad you feel that way.

01:21:33.871 --> 01:21:35.803
Now I'm going
to tell you something

01:21:35.805 --> 01:21:38.440
that you're going to have
complicated feelings about,

01:21:38.442 --> 01:21:40.241
and you may not be so thrilled
to hear it,

01:21:40.243 --> 01:21:42.210
but I have to be honest.

01:21:42.212 --> 01:21:44.178
Hmm.

01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:46.781
Why'd I suddenly get nervous?

01:21:46.783 --> 01:21:50.221
I've been having an affair
with Ginny.

01:21:51.121 --> 01:21:52.620
That's right.

01:21:52.622 --> 01:21:54.789
She's very unhappily married
to your father,

01:21:54.791 --> 01:21:57.191
and we met at the beach
and it began,

01:21:57.193 --> 01:21:59.061
and while I like her very much,

01:21:59.063 --> 01:22:02.698
and I've even tried to
convince myself that I love her,

01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:05.400
but I'm just not
in love with her.

01:22:05.402 --> 01:22:06.834
And she's looking for someone

01:22:06.836 --> 01:22:09.137
to pull her out
of her unhappy marriage,

01:22:09.139 --> 01:22:11.839
and it's never going to be me.

01:22:11.841 --> 01:22:14.545
So I'm going to break with her
either way.

01:22:15.313 --> 01:22:16.878
But I still
wanted you to know

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.983
the, the whole story.

01:22:20.017 --> 01:22:23.084
This is gonna kill my father.

01:22:23.086 --> 01:22:25.456
He's so dependent on her.

01:22:26.857 --> 01:22:28.324
How...

01:22:28.326 --> 01:22:32.061
...how awful for Ginny.

01:22:32.063 --> 01:22:34.896
Oh, God, I...

01:22:34.898 --> 01:22:37.165
I told her we were going
for dinner here tonight

01:22:37.167 --> 01:22:39.034
and that I...

01:22:39.036 --> 01:22:42.607
I hoped that you'd finally
tell me how you felt about me.

01:22:43.741 --> 01:22:45.673
And I did.

01:22:45.675 --> 01:22:49.544
I don't know
how to take all of this.

01:22:49.546 --> 01:22:51.146
I'm sure you don't.

01:22:51.148 --> 01:22:54.682
It just seems to go
from one drama to another.

01:22:54.684 --> 01:22:56.752
Can we get the check?

01:22:56.754 --> 01:22:59.021
- I'll get it.
- No, no, no, no.

01:22:59.023 --> 01:23:02.527
No, it's,
uh, it's my treat.

01:23:04.995 --> 01:23:06.698
Thank you.

01:23:07.598 --> 01:23:09.565
Hey, my car's
just around the corner.

01:23:09.567 --> 01:23:12.234
- I'll drop you off.
- I prefer to walk.

01:23:12.236 --> 01:23:13.668
Okay, well, I'll walk with you.

01:23:13.670 --> 01:23:16.540
No, I have
a lot of thinking to do.

01:23:17.942 --> 01:23:20.209
Yeah, okay.

01:23:20.211 --> 01:23:22.811
Yeah, got it.
Um, I'll call you later.

01:23:22.813 --> 01:23:26.647
And I'm, I'm sorry
if I upset you.

01:23:26.649 --> 01:23:28.819
It's a lot to take in.

01:23:30.286 --> 01:23:32.656
It's nice to know
you love me.

01:24:15.331 --> 01:24:16.632
Yes?

01:24:16.634 --> 01:24:18.834
You take out my daughter
last night?

01:24:18.836 --> 01:24:20.668
Oh, you're Carolina's father.

01:24:20.670 --> 01:24:22.603
I'm Mickey Ruben.
I'm happy to meet you.

01:24:22.605 --> 01:24:24.373
Yeah, well, where is she?

01:24:24.375 --> 01:24:26.008
Now?
Isn't she at work?

01:24:26.010 --> 01:24:28.780
No, no, no, she didn't come in.
I already called.

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:31.480
She didn't come home
last night?

01:24:31.482 --> 01:24:33.248
She didn't stay with you?

01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:35.086
No, she went home.

01:24:35.752 --> 01:24:37.319
Listen, you could
tell me the truth.

01:24:37.321 --> 01:24:38.786
You know,
I'm kind of worried about her.

01:24:38.788 --> 01:24:40.955
We had a pizza
at Capri Pizzeria,

01:24:40.957 --> 01:24:43.124
and then we left.
We had a nice time.

01:24:43.126 --> 01:24:46.027
I offered to drive her home,
and she said she wanted to walk.

01:24:46.029 --> 01:24:48.362
I-I told your daughter
that I cared for her very much,

01:24:48.364 --> 01:24:49.932
and she wanted time
to think things over.

01:24:49.934 --> 01:24:52.200
- Wait, what do you mean she didn't come home?
- She didn't sleep at your place?

01:24:52.202 --> 01:24:53.869
No, I'm telling you.

01:24:53.871 --> 01:24:55.704
We split up after dinner.
I told her I'd call her.

01:24:55.706 --> 01:24:57.372
You know,
I'm gonna call the police.

01:24:57.374 --> 01:24:59.508
They're gonna wanna check
your place out, you know that.

01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:01.310
Listen, she wasn't at my place.

01:25:01.312 --> 01:25:04.346
I live in Greenwich Village.
They're free to check it out.

01:25:04.348 --> 01:25:06.147
Which way did she go
when you split up?

01:25:06.149 --> 01:25:07.915
She went over
toward the boardwalk,

01:25:07.917 --> 01:25:11.052
and I walked around the block
to get my car.

01:25:11.054 --> 01:25:13.120
If you're lying to me...
if you're lying to me,

01:25:13.122 --> 01:25:15.057
you're gonna be in
a lot of trouble, you know that?

01:25:15.059 --> 01:25:18.496
Take it easy.
I'm as alarmed as you are.

01:25:19.596 --> 01:25:22.830
She tell you that these,
these guys are after her?

01:25:22.832 --> 01:25:24.866
I know her whole story,
but, but she didn't walk around

01:25:24.868 --> 01:25:29.237
as if she was worried about it,
and I didn't see anybody.

01:25:29.239 --> 01:25:31.643
Where the hell is she?

01:25:38.114 --> 01:25:41.350
What's the matter, Mom?

01:25:41.352 --> 01:25:42.817
Nothing.

01:25:42.819 --> 01:25:45.223
Then why are you drinking?

01:25:45.755 --> 01:25:48.723
- This is my first.
- Third.

01:25:48.725 --> 01:25:50.691
Can I go to the movies?

01:25:50.693 --> 01:25:53.027
Picture at the Neptune changed.

01:25:53.029 --> 01:25:55.030
Oh, yeah?

01:25:55.032 --> 01:25:56.565
What's there?

01:25:56.567 --> 01:25:58.499
<i>Flying Down to Rio.</i>

01:25:58.501 --> 01:26:01.003
Oh, Rio de Janeiro?

01:26:01.005 --> 01:26:02.870
That sounds pretty good,
doesn't it?

01:26:02.872 --> 01:26:08.377
- Yeah, you wanna come?
- To Rio or to the movies?

01:26:08.379 --> 01:26:10.378
I'd like to go to Rio.

01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:12.616
And never come back.

01:26:13.651 --> 01:26:16.217
They got her.

01:26:16.219 --> 01:26:17.886
They got Carolina.

01:26:17.888 --> 01:26:20.254
Somehow, they knew
where she was,

01:26:20.256 --> 01:26:22.658
- and they snatched her.
- Why, why do you say that?

01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:24.125
I knew it.
I knew it.

01:26:24.127 --> 01:26:26.061
- Give me that.
- No, no, Humpty, no.

01:26:26.063 --> 01:26:28.163
I'm not gonna argue with you.
You give me a hard time,

01:26:28.165 --> 01:26:29.964
I'm gonna knock you through
the goddamn window.

01:26:29.966 --> 01:26:32.334
- Give it to me.
- No, okay, okay, okay.

01:26:32.336 --> 01:26:35.203
Okay, c-calm down.

01:26:35.205 --> 01:26:37.204
I... no, no, they meant,

01:26:37.206 --> 01:26:39.775
they meant to get her,
they meant to kill her,

01:26:39.777 --> 01:26:41.709
and by now, she's probably dead.

01:26:41.711 --> 01:26:43.311
No, wh... what are
you talking about?

01:26:43.313 --> 01:26:44.846
You don't know anything.

01:26:44.848 --> 01:26:47.249
Don't tell me I don't know
what I'm talking about.

01:26:47.251 --> 01:26:48.984
I wasn't born yesterday.

01:26:48.986 --> 01:26:52.721
They knew exactly where she was,
right down to the pizza joint.

01:26:52.723 --> 01:26:54.890
I'm going to the movies.
Can I have 50 cents?

01:26:54.892 --> 01:26:57.793
Goddamn it, here, here, here.

01:26:57.795 --> 01:26:59.895
Take it! Take it!
Take it all!

01:26:59.897 --> 01:27:02.731
Now you don't have to steal it.
I gave it to you.

01:27:02.733 --> 01:27:04.833
Okay, okay, okay, well, did,
did you call the police?

01:27:04.835 --> 01:27:08.605
- Ah, naturally!
- Well, they'll find her.

01:27:09.872 --> 01:27:11.707
What the hell do you care?

01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:13.842
What the hell do you care?
You don't even like her.

01:27:13.844 --> 01:27:16.645
- So...
- You hated her.

01:27:16.647 --> 01:27:18.981
You were the one
who wanted her out.

01:27:18.983 --> 01:27:21.182
- Stop it.
- No!

01:27:21.184 --> 01:27:24.518
No, you, you were the one
making all the cracks

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.021
about how I'm too close to her.

01:27:27.023 --> 01:27:28.723
You, you could have tipped 'em.

01:27:28.725 --> 01:27:30.158
Well, I didn't,
so don't be crazy!

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:32.960
If you did, I will,
I will kill you.

01:27:32.962 --> 01:27:34.862
Stop!
You're scaring me.

01:27:34.864 --> 01:27:36.498
- Stop drinking!
- No, no, no.

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:39.935
Somehow, for some reason,
they knew, they knew.

01:27:39.937 --> 01:27:41.869
- Why did they come back?
- Well, it wasn't me!

01:27:41.871 --> 01:27:43.805
I'd never do that.
It's...

01:27:43.807 --> 01:27:46.741
I wouldn't know who or how
if I w-wanted to.

01:27:46.743 --> 01:27:49.110
What, what do you,
what do you mean?

01:27:49.112 --> 01:27:50.712
What do you mean,
"if you wanted to"?

01:27:50.714 --> 01:27:52.114
- I wa...
- Did you?

01:27:52.116 --> 01:27:53.882
I'd never do such a thing.
Oh, God.

01:27:53.884 --> 01:27:55.683
Leave me alone.
You're hurting me.

01:27:55.685 --> 01:27:57.652
Ah, you're hurting me.

01:27:57.654 --> 01:28:00.021
Ginny, I'm sorry.
I-I can't believe this.

01:28:00.023 --> 01:28:01.990
- I'm going nuts.
- I-I...

01:28:01.992 --> 01:28:03.659
She finally comes back
and now this.

01:28:03.661 --> 01:28:05.393
God, I don't want
to be around you...

01:28:05.395 --> 01:28:06.895
around you
when you're like this.

01:28:06.897 --> 01:28:08.797
Ginny, no, no, don't...
stay here!

01:28:08.799 --> 01:28:10.531
I don't wanna be alone.
I can't handle this without you.

01:28:10.533 --> 01:28:13.067
I gotta get some air.
God, I'm choking.

01:28:13.069 --> 01:28:16.437
Ginny, Ginny,
I can't believe this.

01:28:16.439 --> 01:28:18.306
I can't believe she's gone.

01:28:18.308 --> 01:28:20.142
W-well, do...
well, don't look at me.

01:28:20.144 --> 01:28:21.942
Don't, don't,
don't stare at me.

01:28:21.944 --> 01:28:25.148
You look funny.

01:28:26.783 --> 01:28:28.350
- You're imagining it.
- Goddamn it!

01:28:29.952 --> 01:28:32.156
I need another drink!

01:29:27.711 --> 01:29:29.578
What're you doing here?

01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.780
I came to speak to you.

01:29:31.782 --> 01:29:33.949
Oh, well, yes,
but do you think it was wise

01:29:33.951 --> 01:29:35.283
to show up at my door?

01:29:35.285 --> 01:29:39.186
I mean, I do have a husband,
you know.

01:29:39.188 --> 01:29:41.722
My God...

01:29:41.724 --> 01:29:44.359
...I was not expecting anyone.

01:29:44.361 --> 01:29:47.428
I must look like
the wreck of the Hesperus.

01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:48.930
I thought about it,
but in the end

01:29:48.932 --> 01:29:51.199
I decided
to come here.

01:29:51.201 --> 01:29:53.435
Oh, if you're,
if you're gonna tell me that

01:29:53.437 --> 01:29:56.103
you've made a terrible mistake
and thrown away a relationship

01:29:56.105 --> 01:29:58.405
with a woman you now realize
loved you in a way

01:29:58.407 --> 01:30:01.409
that you will probably
never experience again,

01:30:01.411 --> 01:30:03.744
still...

01:30:03.746 --> 01:30:06.448
it was reckless of you
to come to where I live.

01:30:06.450 --> 01:30:09.517
It just so happens,
Humpty's out.

01:30:09.519 --> 01:30:11.520
He's, uh... he, he got drunk

01:30:11.522 --> 01:30:14.556
and he, he accused me
of unspeakable things.

01:30:14.558 --> 01:30:16.591
I mean,
he's understandably distraught,

01:30:16.593 --> 01:30:20.762
but, but he scares me.
He...

01:30:20.764 --> 01:30:22.798
He scares me,
but I will say,

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.432
I told him many times.

01:30:24.434 --> 01:30:26.700
"You're smothering that girl.
It's not healthy."

01:30:26.702 --> 01:30:28.602
I mean, she's,
she's a grown woman.

01:30:28.604 --> 01:30:30.137
She's a divorcee.

01:30:30.139 --> 01:30:32.007
I-I mean, you'd think
she was 15 years old

01:30:32.009 --> 01:30:34.142
the way he fussed over her
and hovered.

01:30:34.144 --> 01:30:38.445
But, did she act strange
when you had dinner with her?

01:30:38.447 --> 01:30:40.515
Because she is
a strange creature.

01:30:40.517 --> 01:30:42.683
I w... I warned you about that.

01:30:42.685 --> 01:30:44.218
I mean, for all we know...

01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:46.120
you know, maybe she's
gone back to her husband

01:30:46.122 --> 01:30:48.923
or decided maybe Mexico
is best for her.

01:30:48.925 --> 01:30:50.825
But I did warn you
she was marked.

01:30:50.827 --> 01:30:53.727
You cast me aside
for a marked woman,

01:30:53.729 --> 01:30:55.430
and now I hope
you're not asking,

01:30:55.432 --> 01:30:58.365
"Is it possible to just
take up where we left off?"

01:30:58.367 --> 01:31:01.402
I mean, that's,
that's a little opportunistic,

01:31:01.404 --> 01:31:03.771
wouldn't you say?
I mean, it kinda reads that way.

01:31:03.773 --> 01:31:05.339
But when it comes to love,

01:31:05.341 --> 01:31:08.476
we often turn out to be
our own worst enemy.

01:31:08.478 --> 01:31:12.547
I suppose one of the advantages
of being a little older is that

01:31:12.549 --> 01:31:15.083
we have more tolerance
for mistakes.

01:31:15.085 --> 01:31:17.351
Because over the years,
we all have made our share.

01:31:17.353 --> 01:31:21.623
That's... that's why forgiveness

01:31:21.625 --> 01:31:24.159
is possible.

01:31:24.161 --> 01:31:27.230
What a cold world
it would be without it.

01:31:28.831 --> 01:31:31.501
I know the whole story, Ginny.

01:31:33.502 --> 01:31:35.206
What story?

01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:39.109
I know what it is you did.

01:31:40.143 --> 01:31:43.210
I-I don't know
what you're referring to.

01:31:43.212 --> 01:31:46.681
Oh, you've suddenly adopted
a supercilious tone of voice.

01:31:46.683 --> 01:31:49.683
By now she's probably rubbed out
or dumped somewhere.

01:31:49.685 --> 01:31:51.386
Oh, my God, this is awful.

01:31:51.388 --> 01:31:54.923
"Rubbed out," "dumped."
My goodness.

01:31:54.925 --> 01:31:59.060
Well, don't you think you're
being a little melodramatic?

01:31:59.062 --> 01:32:01.061
I put it together.

01:32:01.063 --> 01:32:04.598
I spoke to Humpty, to Tiny.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.768
The phone at Ruby's
was out of order.

01:32:07.770 --> 01:32:09.905
You used a payphone.

01:32:09.907 --> 01:32:13.842
I spoke to John from Capri.

01:32:13.844 --> 01:32:18.713
A woman called,
and then hung up.

01:32:18.715 --> 01:32:20.048
I got it.

01:32:20.050 --> 01:32:22.417
It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes

01:32:22.419 --> 01:32:25.719
or, or Eugene O'Neill
to plot this one out.

01:32:25.721 --> 01:32:27.588
A lifeguard can do it.

01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:29.958
I don't know
what you're implying.

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:32.360
I'm not implying.

01:32:32.362 --> 01:32:33.998
I'm accusing.

01:32:35.564 --> 01:32:37.097
Accusing me?

01:32:37.099 --> 01:32:38.700
You certainly don't
seem too concerned

01:32:38.702 --> 01:32:41.369
- by her disappearance.
- How would you know?

01:32:41.371 --> 01:32:43.338
What, because
I'm not a mass of hysteria?

01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:46.473
Like her father who has
an unnatural attachment to her.

01:32:46.475 --> 01:32:50.311
Plus, I think I should tell you,
I've had a few drinks.

01:32:50.313 --> 01:32:53.448
I know I told you I never drink,
but...

01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:56.084
when I'm under
severe emotional strain,

01:32:56.086 --> 01:32:58.887
it's, you know,
it's just sometimes

01:32:58.889 --> 01:33:01.856
the only thing that
keeps me head from throbbing.

01:33:01.858 --> 01:33:03.490
You wanted her gone.

01:33:03.492 --> 01:33:06.127
- Oh, please, you're delusional.
- No.

01:33:06.129 --> 01:33:08.730
That you think that I could...
no, you know, I will...

01:33:08.732 --> 01:33:11.031
I am not going to stand here

01:33:11.033 --> 01:33:13.200
and have my character sullied

01:33:13.202 --> 01:33:16.303
- by wild and fantastical insinuations.
- I didn't think you had it in you.

01:33:16.305 --> 01:33:18.205
- What, that I-I lacked
sufficient stature?

01:33:18.207 --> 01:33:20.307
You had time to warn her,
and you hung up the phone.

01:33:20.309 --> 01:33:23.177
That I was too mediocre a person
to rise to a tragic action?

01:33:23.179 --> 01:33:25.446
Honey, I don't know
what fanciful scenario

01:33:25.448 --> 01:33:27.682
you're writing in your own mind,
but I suggest you get a grip

01:33:27.684 --> 01:33:29.551
- on your imagination.
- I can't believe this.

01:33:29.553 --> 01:33:31.686
You had time to warn her.
You hung up the phone.

01:33:31.688 --> 01:33:34.422
Well...

01:33:34.424 --> 01:33:36.825
...maybe in the end,
you misread my body language.

01:33:36.827 --> 01:33:40.527
I mean, you said it wasn't
an exact science.

01:33:40.529 --> 01:33:42.797
You know?

01:33:42.799 --> 01:33:45.200
I loved her.

01:33:45.202 --> 01:33:47.768
Jesus Christ!

01:33:47.770 --> 01:33:50.140
You just met her!

01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:54.375
Well, no, I forgot,
you're a dreamer

01:33:54.377 --> 01:33:56.210
who believes in
love at first sight.

01:33:56.212 --> 01:33:57.579
You know, when I think of it...

01:33:57.581 --> 01:33:59.280
when I think of it, I could...
I could...

01:33:59.282 --> 01:34:02.350
What?
What?

01:34:02.352 --> 01:34:04.654
What?

01:34:06.322 --> 01:34:08.623
And you, you,
you could live with this!

01:34:08.625 --> 01:34:10.361
Huh?

01:34:11.361 --> 01:34:14.829
Oh, God, spare me the bad drama.

01:34:14.831 --> 01:34:18.066
Oh, here.
Here.

01:34:18.068 --> 01:34:19.933
Why don't you kill me?

01:34:19.935 --> 01:34:21.503
And avenge her, huh?

01:34:21.505 --> 01:34:24.405
Isn't... isn't that
the way it happened

01:34:24.407 --> 01:34:28.345
in the, uh, theater
in Athens?

01:35:23.666 --> 01:35:27.203
What good are the police
if that's the job they do?

01:35:29.371 --> 01:35:32.075
Police can't protect you.

01:35:36.278 --> 01:35:38.480
You look a little crazy to me.

01:35:42.352 --> 01:35:44.218
Why are you staring
at me like that?

01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:47.758
- I'm fine.
- Staring at you like what?

01:35:49.826 --> 01:35:52.960
Where'd you get the dress?

01:35:52.962 --> 01:35:55.265
You're nuts.

01:35:56.366 --> 01:36:00.101
You know, uh, uh, don't get
on my nerves, Ginny, okay?

01:36:00.103 --> 01:36:03.905
I-I swear to God,
I will smash you.

01:36:03.907 --> 01:36:06.377
I am not in the mood.

01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:10.814
You... and you look
a little crazy to me.

01:36:12.182 --> 01:36:14.518
Leave me alone.

01:36:30.332 --> 01:36:32.836
G-Ginny, I'm sorry.

01:36:34.270 --> 01:36:36.474
I'm sorry, Ginny.

01:36:38.707 --> 01:36:41.142
Don't ever leave me.

01:36:41.144 --> 01:36:42.877
That's not what
you were thinkin', was it?

01:36:42.879 --> 01:36:47.147
I was thinking Richie'll
be home from the movies soon.

01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:49.385
He'll be hungry.

01:36:52.354 --> 01:36:55.125
I don't believe what happened.

01:36:57.359 --> 01:37:00.464
You gotta get me through this
like you did...

01:37:01.730 --> 01:37:04.065
Like you did.
Y-y-you know, y-you gotta...

01:37:04.067 --> 01:37:06.904
I gotta wash my uniform.

01:37:22.551 --> 01:37:25.652
Talked to Connie Ryan.

01:37:25.654 --> 01:37:29.790
They're goin' fishin' Labor Day.

01:37:29.792 --> 01:37:31.929
You wanna go?

01:37:33.697 --> 01:37:35.766
No.

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.803
I don't like fishing.
