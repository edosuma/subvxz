00:02.358 --> 00:03.119
Good morning

00:03.120 --> 00:04.592
and welcome to "mear d--"

00:04.593 --> 00:06.788
"dear--" oh, God. I'm sorry.

00:07.188 --> 00:10.901
I'm sorry. I think maybe you're
gonna have to bear with me.

00:10.902 --> 00:13.333
Hopefully my coffee will kick in soon,

00:13.334 --> 00:17.618
'cause this little mom has
had one hell of a weekend.

00:18.660 --> 00:20.150
When Charles Dickens wrote,

00:20.151 --> 00:23.082
"it was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,"

00:23.083 --> 00:26.255
who knew he was actually talking
about my daughter's wedding?

00:26.881 --> 00:27.851
Or...

00:28.859 --> 00:31.964
More accurately, our daughter's wedding.

00:32.973 --> 00:34.989
But that was only part of the problem.

00:44.615 --> 00:46.265
Are you awake yet, honey?

00:48.284 --> 00:51.301
Yes. I'm awake.

00:52.162 --> 00:53.611
I didn't sleep very well.

00:54.224 --> 00:55.382
Mm. Me neither.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.808
I have a terrible feeling of foreboding.

00:59.284 --> 01:02.562
Oh, Sarah. You're-- you're just a bride.

01:02.670 --> 01:04.468
That's how brides feel.
You're just nervous.

01:04.470 --> 01:07.202
And besides, the whole reason
you spent the night here

01:07.203 --> 01:11.251
was so you wouldn't see Luc,
so you wouldn't jinx it.

01:11.492 --> 01:13.168
But I should be at mom's,

01:13.400 --> 01:15.381
like I was with my first wedding.

01:15.658 --> 01:18.173
Oh, I don't know.
Look how that turned out.

01:19.846 --> 01:22.491
Are you 100% positive

01:22.492 --> 01:25.737
that they're really seeing each other?

01:25.998 --> 01:27.954
Yeah. She's seeing Brody.

01:27.955 --> 01:28.956
The last time I saw them,

01:28.957 --> 01:31.230
they were all snuggled
together on the couch.

01:31.231 --> 01:32.122
She's probably wondering

01:32.123 --> 01:34.178
why I'm not calling him daddy already.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.967
So why don't you go over and
get dressed at her house?

01:38.968 --> 01:42.364
Get dressed in your old bedroom.
You know she wants that.

01:42.365 --> 01:43.468
Well, it's too late for that.

01:43.469 --> 01:45.578
Everything's organized
for me at the church.

01:46.142 --> 01:47.915
It is your wedding, Sarah.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.758
And I don't want you to regret anything.

01:57.909 --> 01:58.977
Are you awake?

01:59.923 --> 02:00.941
Scotty?

02:01.730 --> 02:03.388
Are you awake, honey?

02:03.389 --> 02:04.392
No.

02:04.473 --> 02:05.897
What are you doing out here?

02:06.410 --> 02:08.335
Mm. Daniel woke up. I had to feed him.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.685
Oh, well, Daniel's asleep,

02:09.686 --> 02:11.061
so why don't you come back to bed?

02:11.062 --> 02:14.153
Oh. Honey, as much as I miss sex,

02:14.154 --> 02:16.079
I miss sleep more.

02:17.150 --> 02:17.664
Hello.

02:17.665 --> 02:20.575
- Hi. It's me. - Were you gonna
have sex with your Bluetooth on?

02:20.576 --> 02:22.456
- Yeah, I'm the wedding planner.
I have to be on call. - Oh.

02:22.457 --> 02:26.466
- Please tell me everything's okay.
- Yes. Have a little faith.

02:26.561 --> 02:27.972
Hold on. Someone's on the other line.

02:27.973 --> 02:30.296
- Hello?  - I really need to talk to you.
What, about Sarah?

02:30.297 --> 02:33.908
- She's on the other line.
- No, it's about me, and don't tell Sarah.

02:33.909 --> 02:35.315
Just call me back whenever you can,

02:35.316 --> 02:37.619
- okay?
- I am the wedding planner, but okay.

02:37.849 --> 02:40.592
- Sarah. - Who was that?
- Uh, the deejay.

02:40.593 --> 02:41.757
Hang on. Someone's on the other line.

02:41.758 --> 02:42.772
- K--
- Hello?

02:42.773 --> 02:44.663
It's Paige. Can you talk to my mom?

02:44.664 --> 02:46.866
She won't let me bring
Andrew to the wedding.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.241
Paige, why are you talking funny,
and who's Andrew?

02:49.242 --> 02:51.722
I have a mask on,
and I don't want it to crack,

02:51.723 --> 02:52.841
and he's my boyfriend.

02:52.842 --> 02:55.169
- You have a boyfriend?
- Paige has a boyfriend?

02:55.170 --> 02:56.982
- Yeah, he's so cool.
- I'll talk to your mom.

02:56.983 --> 02:57.882
She's on the other line.

02:57.883 --> 02:59.177
- Please.
- Done.

02:59.344 --> 03:01.143
So Paige has this boyfriend who--

03:01.144 --> 03:04.445
- Oh, God. If I hear one more thing
about--  - Fine. It's dropped.

03:04.446 --> 03:07.004
Good. Now please tell me,
is everything set up at the hotel?

03:07.005 --> 03:08.604
Yeah, I'm sure,
but I'll check in with Justin.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.133
Oh, is he still sleeping with that manager?

03:11.134 --> 03:12.759
-Yes.
- Is she still married?

03:12.760 --> 03:14.165
I think she's getting a divorce.

03:14.166 --> 03:16.052
Oh, yeah. That's what they all say.

03:20.146 --> 03:22.395
- Hello? - Now I know we're not
supposed to see each other,

03:22.396 --> 03:25.328
- but I thought it would be okay
if we talked. - I missed you.

03:25.329 --> 03:26.764
I missed you, too. Hey,

03:26.765 --> 03:28.934
- are your parents here yet?
- This afternoon.

03:28.935 --> 03:30.716
I can't believe I'm gonna see my dad.

03:30.717 --> 03:31.710
It's been such a long time.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.151
I can't believe
they're actually coming together.

03:34.152 --> 03:36.695
- Yeah, me, too.
- You're getting married.

03:36.696 --> 03:39.499
- You're getting married.
- Here we go.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.163
Luc, you have to talk to mom.

03:41.164 --> 03:44.657
- Whoa. What happened to you?
- I'm wearing a face mask.

03:44.794 --> 03:46.832
- It's early.
- Well, i-is that her?

03:46.833 --> 03:48.666
Okay, put her on.

03:48.683 --> 03:51.839
Mom. Mom, can we please just
talk about this like adults?

03:51.840 --> 03:54.577
No, because you're not an adult.
It's not appropriate.

03:54.578 --> 03:56.036
Just forget it.

03:57.875 --> 03:58.880
I'll take care of it.

03:58.881 --> 04:00.020
Thank you.

04:00.852 --> 04:01.977
Oh, listen, honey, I gotta go.

04:01.978 --> 04:04.479
Someone's at the door.
I can't wait to see you.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.096
- I love you.
- Okay, bye.

04:10.201 --> 04:11.218
Tommy!

04:13.515 --> 04:14.954
Ooh. I can't believe you're here.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.284
Well, you asked me to
walk you down the aisle.

04:17.285 --> 04:18.485
Where do you think I'd be?

04:18.486 --> 04:21.168
Daniel is still sleep,
so why don't you come back to bed?

04:21.168 --> 04:22.991
- Kevin, no, I don't want to.
- Well--

04:22.992 --> 04:25.126
How come you guys won't help Paige?

04:25.338 --> 04:27.691
- Uh--no.
- Because it's none of our business.

04:28.103 --> 04:29.897
Paige, they're not budging.

04:30.356 --> 04:32.091
Man, I can't believe this.

04:33.867 --> 04:35.861
Uh, hold on. It's Andrew on the other line.

04:35.862 --> 04:36.999
- Ooh.
- Okay? I'll call you back.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.148
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:39.345 --> 04:41.815
- Hello. - Yeah, hey, Kevin.
It's Saul. Listen we have

04:41.816 --> 04:44.193
a little bit of a problem here,
and you know what, buddy?

04:44.194 --> 04:46.725
- I don't want you to panic.
- What? Of course I'm panicking.

04:46.726 --> 04:49.045
You say something like that,
Saul, of course I'm gonna panic.

04:49.046 --> 04:52.664
Kevin, the cake isn't here.
They got the date all wrong.

04:52.665 --> 04:53.866
So what we've been doing is,

04:53.867 --> 04:57.380
uh, Jonathan and I have been up
all night, uh, making cupcakes.

04:57.381 --> 04:59.674
- Cupcakes?
- I love cupcakes.

04:59.675 --> 05:02.042
That's right.
We're gonna make a cupcake tree.

05:02.043 --> 05:03.952
Kevin, you know what?
I'm not happy about this either.

05:03.953 --> 05:05.655
It's very wedding chic right now.

05:05.656 --> 05:07.644
I can't believe this.
Have you spoken with Sarah?

05:07.645 --> 05:10.188
- 'Cause she's gonna rip me a new one.
- I knew you were gonna freak,

05:10.189 --> 05:11.247
and I don't want to talk
to you about this now.

05:11.248 --> 05:13.457
I have 200 cupcakes that we have to finish,

05:13.458 --> 05:14.732
and I want to tell you something, Kevin.

05:14.733 --> 05:17.191
I'm gonna call Sarah
because you're a wuss.

05:19.543 --> 05:20.990
Hey, Paige. Are you all right?

05:20.991 --> 05:23.605
Yeah, I'll be fine.
I'm--I'm not gonna ruin the day for mom.

05:23.606 --> 05:26.061
- Ask her if Luc is up.
- Is Luc up?

05:26.062 --> 05:27.531
He's right here. It's Kevin.

05:27.532 --> 05:29.370
- Oh. Hey, Kevin.
- Stop.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.936
- Hi, how's it going?
- Oh, it's going great.

05:31.937 --> 05:34.527
I have the two kids right next to me,
my parents are coming,

05:34.528 --> 05:36.955
and I'm getting married. Not a bad day.

05:36.982 --> 05:38.541
How do you feel about cupcakes?
Hold on a second.

05:38.542 --> 05:40.464
Cupcakes? Oh!

05:40.465 --> 05:41.776
Oh, that's mom calling me on the cell.

05:41.777 --> 05:45.040
Let me, uh,
I'll-- I'll call you back. Hello.

05:45.041 --> 05:47.015
- How's it going?
- Don't ask. How is it with you?

05:47.016 --> 05:47.782
I'm fine.

05:47.783 --> 05:51.469
I'm trying to find something
for Sarah to use for the old.

05:51.470 --> 05:52.787
- For the what?
- The old.

05:52.788 --> 05:55.674
You know, something old,
something new, blah, blah, blah.

05:55.675 --> 05:57.844
And then I'm to give it
to her at the church.

05:57.845 --> 05:59.762
Have you spoken with Sarah yet?

05:59.763 --> 06:02.560
Not really. She seems to be avoiding me.

06:02.656 --> 06:06.172
Kevin, this is just... so awful.

06:06.173 --> 06:08.415
Try not to worry.
I'm sure everything will be fine.

06:08.476 --> 06:09.929
Yeah. You know, I have to go,

06:09.930 --> 06:13.547
- so I-I-I'll see you at the church.
- Yeah, bye.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.436
You can't keep coming over
for breakfast like this.

06:17.437 --> 06:19.407
Well, then stop inviting me.

06:19.855 --> 06:21.783
Well, I can't stop inviting you.

06:21.784 --> 06:23.383
- I hate it when you leave at night.
- Oh.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.631
I can't wait for the morning to come.

06:25.632 --> 06:27.193
Oh, I know the feeling.

06:27.194 --> 06:29.253
It can't come soon enough for me.

06:31.075 --> 06:32.138
Whatcha doin'?

06:32.327 --> 06:33.886
Well, I'm trying to find something

06:33.887 --> 06:35.780
that Sarah can use...

06:36.896 --> 06:38.402
You kept this?

06:39.088 --> 06:40.122
Please give that to me.

06:40.123 --> 06:42.412
I already did, 45 years ago.

06:42.413 --> 06:43.696
You kept it?

06:44.876 --> 06:46.911
Well, of course I did.

06:48.256 --> 06:49.284
Mom.

06:54.585 --> 06:55.646
Sarah.

06:55.854 --> 06:58.718
Hello. I-I was just leaving.

06:58.719 --> 06:59.740
Good.

07:00.225 --> 07:02.873
Yeah, well, what are you doing here?

07:02.874 --> 07:04.938
I, uh, just came by for my something old.

07:04.939 --> 07:07.524
Well, I thought I was gonna
bring it to the church.

07:07.631 --> 07:08.644
I j--I thought it would be nice.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.706
If we picked something out together.

07:13.103 --> 07:16.043
So, uh... I'll take off.

07:16.135 --> 07:18.821
And, uh, have a beautiful wedding, Sarah.

07:20.195 --> 07:21.248
Thank you.

07:29.308 --> 07:30.628
Did you tell anyone yet?

07:31.271 --> 07:32.257
No.

07:32.939 --> 07:34.122
I, uh...

07:34.839 --> 07:37.589
I'm not gonna tell anybody
until we make our decision.

07:37.997 --> 07:39.855
Well, I already told you how I feel.

07:40.321 --> 07:41.363
I know.

07:42.321 --> 07:43.879
I know, but, um...

07:45.354 --> 07:46.637
You know, the more I think about this,

07:46.638 --> 07:48.515
the more excited I get.

07:49.284 --> 07:50.450
I mean, Seth, you have to understand,

07:50.451 --> 07:52.626
that this wasn't supposed to happen.

07:56.102 --> 07:58.012
Do you have any idea

07:58.013 --> 08:00.006
what a good dad you're gonna be?

08:00.717 --> 08:03.161
Come on. That's not...
That's not the point.

08:03.162 --> 08:05.605
This is a mistake, Kitty, and you know it.

08:06.378 --> 08:08.712
I don't think that you
should have this baby.

08:10.370 --> 08:11.533
Mommy.

08:11.846 --> 08:14.014
Okay. Okay, I'm coming.

08:27.978 --> 08:31.722
How about this beautiful
old antique barrette?

08:31.723 --> 08:34.205
Maybe I could be my own something old?

08:34.206 --> 08:36.501
How about a purse? You want a purse?
I've got a purse.

08:36.514 --> 08:39.429
- Why are you talking like an auctioneer?
- What are you doing here?

08:39.429 --> 08:42.893
- This is for women only.
- Exactly. I'm just checking in.

08:42.970 --> 08:44.584
- Saul called me about the cupcakes.
- Ugh.

08:44.585 --> 08:47.110
It's--no, it's fine. It's fine.

08:49.805 --> 08:50.784
Wow.

08:51.169 --> 08:53.321
- Oh, my gosh, Paige.
You look like a super model. - Yeah.

08:53.322 --> 08:56.606
How did I ever give birth
to anything so beautiful?

08:57.206 --> 08:59.206
No, stop fussing with it. It fits fine.

08:59.207 --> 09:01.415
It doesn't fit, and even
if it did, who cares?

09:01.416 --> 09:03.498
My boyfriend won't even be here to see it.

09:03.499 --> 09:04.789
- Your boyfriend?
- Your boyfriend? Wow.

09:04.790 --> 09:07.617
Yeah, Andrew.
But since my mom's all about

09:07.618 --> 09:08.771
banning people from the wedding,

09:08.772 --> 09:10.703
- he won't be coming.
- Why can't Andrew come?

09:10.704 --> 09:12.463
Because she's 14.

09:12.729 --> 09:14.170
W-wa-wait a minute.

09:14.171 --> 09:18.552
I seem to remember a young
girl who was barely 14,

09:18.824 --> 09:22.145
who was so madly in love
with Davey Martinez...

09:22.146 --> 09:23.989
- that she wrote a 12-verse song--
- That was a different situation.

09:23.990 --> 09:25.033
What was it called? It was "when

09:25.034 --> 09:27.161
Dave's lips touched mine.
"Dave's lips touched mine."

09:27.162 --> 09:29.586
- Oh, my God. Sing it.
- No! Don't s--

09:29.587 --> 09:32.555
- * When Dave's lips touched mine *
- Don't sing it.

09:32.556 --> 09:34.557
- * I felt so fine *
- Kitty--

09:34.558 --> 09:37.644
- * like a grape on the vine *
- Please, stop.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.754
- * lt tickled my spine *
- Okay. Okay! Okay!

09:39.755 --> 09:45.687
- * but it was so divine * - Andrew can
come to the reception. - He can?

09:45.688 --> 09:48.051
- Yes.
- Thank you! Thank you, Aunt Kitty.

09:48.052 --> 09:50.112
- I'm gonna go call him. - All right.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, Paige.

09:50.113 --> 09:52.391
I've gotta talk to his parents.

09:57.803 --> 09:58.992
Kitty, what's the matter?

09:59.677 --> 10:01.180
It's nothing. It's just--

10:01.710 --> 10:03.191
Oh, God. It's crazy.

10:03.192 --> 10:06.318
It's just I remember Paige
when--when she was a baby.

10:06.993 --> 10:08.180
I mean, look at her.

10:08.893 --> 10:10.393
Yes, I kn--

10:10.878 --> 10:12.097
Okay, I just thought of something.

10:12.098 --> 10:13.785
Okay, I'll be right back.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.059
Okay, what is going on with you?

10:20.362 --> 10:21.751
I'm pregnant.

10:22.775 --> 10:24.150
You're pregnant?

10:24.151 --> 10:26.490
Shh. I just--
I don't want anybody to know.

10:27.706 --> 10:29.137
But that's-- I-I thought you couldn't.

10:29.138 --> 10:31.672
I know. I know. I--it happened.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.513
That's amazing. Are--are you happy?

10:33.514 --> 10:36.609
Yes. I'm very happy, happier every minute.

10:36.610 --> 10:38.597
- It's Seth.
- Well, yeah, I assumed it was Seth.

10:38.598 --> 10:41.790
No. Seth isn't happy.

10:41.830 --> 10:43.478
Okay, I've got it.

10:43.479 --> 10:47.693
This is what she's gonna want--
Ida's compact. It's perfect.

10:47.694 --> 10:49.552
Five, six, seven, eight.

10:49.553 --> 10:53.014
♪ Baby I need your loving ♪

10:53.015 --> 10:54.198
♪ Got to have ♪

10:54.199 --> 10:55.807
♪ all your love ♪

10:55.808 --> 10:57.469
Now maybe I'll do
a little solo? Like...

10:57.470 --> 10:59.734
- * baby I need *
- Okay.

11:00.100 --> 11:01.555
You're laughing.
Why are you laughing again?

11:01.556 --> 11:02.563
No, I'm just enjoying

11:02.564 --> 11:04.581
watching you confirm your heterosexuality.

11:04.582 --> 11:05.669
Come on Justin, you can do this.

11:05.670 --> 11:08.235
Okay, Saul and Cooper-- they learned it.

11:08.236 --> 11:09.844
Tommy got it. It's easy.

11:09.845 --> 11:12.035
Well, it's easy for you.
Look at those hips.

11:12.317 --> 11:13.751
Yeah, how did you become
such a good dancer?

11:13.752 --> 11:18.340
- Did Gabriela teach you?
- No. Uh, actually, it was all my father.

11:18.341 --> 11:20.111
His mom owned a dance studio.

11:20.790 --> 11:22.464
I just can't wait to see
him in a suit, though.

11:22.465 --> 11:24.258
I hope my mom doesn't ruin
the whole thing for him.

11:24.259 --> 11:26.010
She's not gonna ruin your wedding.

11:26.011 --> 11:28.619
Why not? She ruined her own marriage.

11:28.620 --> 11:30.693
He loved her. She cheated on him.

11:30.694 --> 11:32.917
Okay, there was probably other
reasons why it didn't work,

11:32.918 --> 11:35.037
like, you know, maybe they
weren't meant to be together.

11:35.038 --> 11:35.651
Right?

11:35.652 --> 11:38.687
Well, they were married,
and she kept cheating on him.

11:38.941 --> 11:40.267
That's why it didn't work out.

11:40.268 --> 11:41.683
So apropos of nothing, how's Tyler?

11:41.684 --> 11:43.126
She's getting a divorce, all right?

11:43.127 --> 11:46.699
And she's been separated for,
like, ever, and--

11:47.106 --> 11:48.828
- Maybe that's your parents.
- Yeah.

11:48.829 --> 11:50.739
It's been 20 years
I didn't see them together.

11:50.740 --> 11:53.737
- Wow, wow, wow, wow. Yeah, wow. Wow. Wow.
- I don't understand this.

11:53.738 --> 11:56.604
So you put your left foot in front,
and then you turn?

11:56.893 --> 11:59.865
- Hi.
- Oh, darling. Oh.

12:00.343 --> 12:01.761
- How are you?
- Ça va?

12:02.477 --> 12:03.980
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:03.981 --> 12:07.591
Hi, guys. Nice to see you, Justin.

12:08.078 --> 12:09.015
Hey.

12:11.979 --> 12:12.844
O est papa?

12:12.845 --> 12:14.270
He couldn't make it.

12:14.537 --> 12:15.037
What?

12:15.038 --> 12:17.533
He got so swamped with his business.

12:17.534 --> 12:20.689
He tried to get away,
but he just couldn't.

12:20.936 --> 12:22.177
But he sends his love.

12:22.178 --> 12:25.156
And he's really, really sorry.

12:26.002 --> 12:27.185
What about you, mom?

12:28.195 --> 12:29.293
Are you sorry?

12:33.788 --> 12:35.400
Sarah, Sarah, look what I found.

12:35.401 --> 12:38.729
I k this is perfect.
It's your grandmother's compact.

12:38.730 --> 12:41.203
- I even polished it all up--
- No, no, no, mom. It's--it's fine.

12:41.204 --> 12:42.273
Listen, I appreciate you

12:42.274 --> 12:43.471
going up to the attic for all this stuff,

12:43.472 --> 12:46.394
but I think my something old
should be yours.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.712
You know, I remember sneaking in
here when I was a kid.

12:50.713 --> 12:53.653
We would play with this
stuff like it was treasure.

12:54.253 --> 12:55.332
You did?

12:56.253 --> 12:57.426
This ring?

12:57.653 --> 12:59.889
We used to call this your babysitting ring.

12:59.895 --> 13:01.437
You'd only ever wear it
if you were going out.

13:01.438 --> 13:03.755
And we had a sitter.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.552
Well, that's perfect, honey.
Wear that.

13:05.553 --> 13:07.767
No, silver's not right.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.326
Oh, my gosh.

13:10.327 --> 13:11.283
What?

13:12.099 --> 13:14.018
I remember this.

13:15.031 --> 13:16.161
Oh, no. You don't want to wear that.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.195
That's the tackiest thing on earth.

13:18.196 --> 13:20.468
No, no, no, I used to love this.

13:20.469 --> 13:23.980
I'd always ask you,
"mommy, why don't you wear this one?"

13:23.981 --> 13:27.035
And you would say,
"because I don't want to lose it."

13:27.321 --> 13:29.836
So then I would think
it must have been magic,

13:29.981 --> 13:33.310
and that if I wore it,
I'd turn into a princess.

13:35.330 --> 13:36.290
This is it.

13:36.291 --> 13:38.076
This is my something old.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.829
Okay. Fine.

13:41.868 --> 13:43.004
Thanks, mom.

13:58.879 --> 13:59.790
Time?

14:00.381 --> 14:03.147
Uh, about ten minutes since
the last time you asked me.

14:03.158 --> 14:04.846
You know, it might speed
things up if you didn't try

14:04.847 --> 14:07.349
to make each cupcake
into a personal work of art.

14:07.350 --> 14:10.490
Jonathan, I have to replace a
stunning, 3-tier wedding cake

14:10.491 --> 14:12.538
with--with these snacks.

14:12.539 --> 14:14.310
The least we can do is
make each one of these

14:14.311 --> 14:16.469
- look as lovely as possible.
- Everybody loves cupcakes.

14:16.470 --> 14:18.260
They'll be the hit of the event.

14:18.365 --> 14:22.303
Besides, a romantic commitment
between two people

14:22.304 --> 14:24.527
isn't about a wedding cake
or even a marriage.

14:24.528 --> 14:26.764
It's symbolism, Jonathan,
and when two people

14:26.765 --> 14:28.359
make a romantic commitment to each other,

14:28.360 --> 14:31.132
there's got to be something that
they can show to the world.

14:31.133 --> 14:34.801
Isn't it enough for two people
to say "I love you"?

14:36.125 --> 14:37.565
You just don't get it, do you?

14:37.566 --> 14:40.910
- Well, what's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

14:41.078 --> 14:42.623
Oh, come on, Saul.

14:42.881 --> 14:44.973
You're not insinuating that
we should be getting married.

14:44.974 --> 14:46.347
I'm not insinuating anything,

14:46.348 --> 14:48.326
so let's just get this packed up.

14:48.327 --> 14:50.549
And please be caful with the frosting.
Come on.

14:56.013 --> 14:56.632
Hey.

14:56.633 --> 14:58.472
Whoa. Don't you look sharp?

14:58.473 --> 15:01.117
Oh, I feel like I should be
handing out an Oscar in this.

15:01.118 --> 15:01.982
What are you doing here?

15:01.983 --> 15:03.563
- Isn't the wedding about to--
- Oh, no. I'm late.

15:03.564 --> 15:05.325
I just told Luc that
I would drop this stuff off

15:05.326 --> 15:06.613
because they're staying here tonight.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.115
Mona, would you have a
bellman run these up to 412?

15:09.116 --> 15:09.743
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks.

15:09.744 --> 15:12.501
Oh, by the way, are you and Mike
going to that barbecue?

15:12.888 --> 15:15.004
Please don't tell me Dan and I
will be the only couple there

15:15.005 --> 15:16.233
under 70?

15:16.234 --> 15:17.906
No, we aren't going.

15:20.857 --> 15:22.283
I forgot. Everyone here still thinks

15:22.284 --> 15:24.981
- that you and your husband are together.
- I told you,

15:24.982 --> 15:27.642
it's just easier not
to have people ask questions.

15:29.020 --> 15:31.699
So that's his-- that's his name, Mike?

15:32.488 --> 15:33.456
Yeah.

15:34.497 --> 15:37.342
Look, um, this is just starting
to get a little too real.

15:37.343 --> 15:39.143
It's complicated, I know, but that's--

15:39.144 --> 15:41.804
Okay, no, Tyler,
I think we need some space.

15:45.039 --> 15:46.711
Let's figure out what's going on.

15:47.085 --> 15:49.543
My marriage is over.
That's what's going on.

15:51.821 --> 15:54.473
Look, I gotta go.
I'll be back for the reception.

16:00.181 --> 16:00.709
Sarah.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.404
No, no, no, no! You can't see her.

16:02.604 --> 16:05.495
- You can't see her.
- Kevin, I need to talk to Sarah.

16:05.496 --> 16:07.215
- No.
- It's important.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.513
- Kevin.
- Okay, just talk.

16:10.320 --> 16:11.371
Okay.

16:13.629 --> 16:15.569
What is it, honey? Is everything okay?

16:15.787 --> 16:17.189
My father is not coming.

16:18.035 --> 16:20.498
Oh, no. Why not?

16:20.858 --> 16:21.413
I don't know.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.793
My mom gave me some lame excuses

16:22.794 --> 16:24.958
about how overwhelmed he is with work.

16:24.959 --> 16:27.381
I know she did something-- Lied to him,

16:27.382 --> 16:30.034
- told him not to come.
- It's ironic, isn't it?

16:30.111 --> 16:32.058
Here you are,
heartbroken that your dad's not here,

16:32.059 --> 16:34.400
and mine would be here
in a shot if he could.

16:34.621 --> 16:35.883
You're listening to your heart.

16:35.884 --> 16:37.459
- I'm proud of you for that.
- Oh, honey, I'm proud of--

16:37.460 --> 16:39.246
Okay, guys, guys, guys, guys,
I'm so sorry.

16:39.247 --> 16:41.474
- We're really tight on time.
- Wh--

16:46.957 --> 16:47.869
Hey.

16:47.870 --> 16:50.108
Hey, hey. Are we the first ones?

16:50.109 --> 16:52.927
Yes, you are, and I love a man
who's on time. Where's Kitty?

16:52.928 --> 16:54.268
Oh, she's, uh, she's bringing your mom.

16:54.269 --> 16:56.585
Look at you, buddy. Don't you look spiffy?

16:56.586 --> 16:59.068
He also looks like someone who
needs to go to the bathroom?

16:59.069 --> 17:01.562
- Oh, okay. It's, uh,  it's right down
the hall. - Okay.

17:01.563 --> 17:04.992
Um, Kitty told me your news.

17:05.542 --> 17:07.586
- She did?
- Yeah, and I think it's great.

17:08.358 --> 17:10.917
Uh-huh. Um, uh, let's--let's, uh,
let's talk about this later.

17:10.919 --> 17:12.919
Believe me.
I-I wasn't sure if I could handle

17:12.920 --> 17:14.480
being a father either.

17:14.837 --> 17:16.827
Once it happens, it's magic.
And you're probably thinking,

17:16.828 --> 17:19.722
is now the right time,
but is there ever really a right time?

17:19.723 --> 17:24.088
- I gotta go! - Uh... all right.
All right. Let's--let's go.

17:30.093 --> 17:30.653
Hey.

17:30.654 --> 17:31.571
Hi.

17:32.430 --> 17:34.331
I know. I'm not supposed to be here.

17:35.739 --> 17:37.645
I had to see how beautiful you looked

17:37.646 --> 17:39.759
on the day of our daughter's wedding.

17:40.614 --> 17:41.789
Wow.

17:43.903 --> 17:46.866
Oh, Brody. What a mess.

17:48.730 --> 17:49.539
I'm finally ready.

17:49.540 --> 17:53.631
I swear, I just cannot walk in these...
Shoes.

17:53.632 --> 17:55.341
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:56.185 --> 17:57.830
We haven't met, I'm Brody.

17:57.831 --> 17:59.547
I'm guessing that you're Kitty.

17:59.548 --> 18:01.104
Yeah, I'm Kitty. Nice to meet you.

18:01.105 --> 18:03.603
- Yeah.
- So it's late. We've gotta go.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.723
Oh. So you're gonna go to the wedding now?

18:05.724 --> 18:06.927
- Oh, no, ma'am.
- He's not coming to the wedding.

18:06.928 --> 18:08.994
You know he's not coming to the wedding.
He's verboten.

18:08.995 --> 18:11.121
Sarah's probably standing
out there with a bouncer,

18:11.122 --> 18:14.496
- making sure-- - Nora, Nora,
take a breath. It's okay. It's fine.

18:15.980 --> 18:19.643
Well, I'm... sorry.
I mean, this is awkward.

18:19.644 --> 18:21.922
- But Sarah--
- Oh, hey, it's fine.

18:22.820 --> 18:26.110
Okay. Okay, great.
Um, so I'll see you in the car.

18:26.111 --> 18:28.385
I'll--I'll be in the car. Hurry up, okay?

18:29.962 --> 18:30.687
So, um...

18:30.688 --> 18:31.990
I'll call you if I can.

18:31.991 --> 18:33.361
Yeah. Have fun.

18:33.721 --> 18:35.124
Take lots of pictures now.

18:35.125 --> 18:36.336
Yeah, I will.

18:47.503 --> 18:49.354
Mom, you've gotta go very
gently with the zipper.

18:49.355 --> 18:50.531
All right. I will. I will.

18:50.532 --> 18:51.933
Oh, my God, where is my something blue?

18:51.934 --> 18:54.514
- Your what? - My something blue,
a handkerchief of dad's.

18:54.515 --> 18:56.308
- Yes, I know what it is. Hold on.
- Saul got them from the dry cleaners after

18:56.308 --> 18:58.841
- after--after he died, and I haven't
seen it all morning. - Sarah, Sarah, shallow

18:58.997 --> 19:03.569
- breathing sends less oxygen
to the brain. - Kitty?

19:03.570 --> 19:06.707
Sorry. Sorry. I'm just not
feeling so good at the moment.

19:06.708 --> 19:09.830
- Okay, five minutes, ladies. 
- Mom. You--you don't look very good.

19:09.831 --> 19:11.172
- None of us look good.
It's a wedding. - No, mom--

19:11.173 --> 19:12.800
Our nerves are all frayed,
except you sweetheart.

19:12.801 --> 19:14.179
- You look lovely. 
- It's nerves.

19:14.180 --> 19:16.449
M-mom's right.
I'm gonna go find a ladies room.

19:16.450 --> 19:18.830
- Kevin. 
- Don't panic. She'll be fine.

19:18.831 --> 19:20.093
I'm just gonna go check on Luc.

19:20.094 --> 19:21.805
- Okay, mom! Just-- 
- What?

19:22.015 --> 19:24.313
So the bride's on the left side, right?

19:26.213 --> 19:28.347
Yeah, yeah. I--yeah. I don't know.

19:28.348 --> 19:30.849
Dude, this is a wedding, not a funeral.

19:30.850 --> 19:34.288
I know. I'm just...
I'm in my head about Tyler.

19:34.399 --> 19:36.448
Wh-what, is this about what we said?

19:36.449 --> 19:38.619
Come on, dude. We were just razzing you.

19:39.789 --> 19:41.145
No, you guys were right.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.368
Like, what am I, a home wrecker now?

19:42.369 --> 19:43.924
I don't want to be that guy,
especially with the history

19:43.925 --> 19:44.985
in this family, Tommy.

19:44.985 --> 19:47.097
Relax, all right? 
Th-this could be a good thing.

19:47.919 --> 19:49.117
We're at a wedding.

19:49.118 --> 19:50.507
Do you know what the number-one cause

19:50.508 --> 19:53.667
- of drunken horniness in girls is? 
- Tequila.

19:53.895 --> 19:54.874
No.

19:55.407 --> 19:56.788
Desperation.

19:56.789 --> 19:58.928
And nothing ignites
desperation in the ladies

19:58.929 --> 20:01.631
like watching one of their own 
get the golden ticket.

20:01.632 --> 20:03.696
Uh, when did you become Jack Nicholson?

20:03.724 --> 20:06.620
Hey, I'm just your brother
trying to help, all right?

20:06.718 --> 20:08.808
You don't need her, all right?

20:08.809 --> 20:10.952
Hey, are you guys here
for the Walker wedding?

20:12.857 --> 20:14.236
Yes, we, uh, yeah.

20:14.237 --> 20:16.173
It should be starting any minute.

20:18.317 --> 20:21.100
Oh, sorry. Churches make me nervous.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.447
Can't imagine why.

20:22.448 --> 20:24.382
Uh, you don't know where
I could find a drink, do you?

20:24.382 --> 20:26.341
Um, this is a church.

20:26.529 --> 20:27.948
Right.

20:27.949 --> 20:30.156
Well, they don't call me
spring break '99 for nothing.

20:32.009 --> 20:33.864
Um, where's the little girl's room?

20:35.184 --> 20:36.343
Uh, little girl's room

20:36.344 --> 20:38.285
is straight down at the end of the hall.

20:38.286 --> 20:40.445
- You can't miss it. 
- Thanks.

20:40.629 --> 20:41.846
I'll catch you later...

20:42.002 --> 20:44.915
- If there's a God.
- Whoa.

20:44.969 --> 20:47.629
Are you sad that
your dad didn't come?

20:48.336 --> 20:51.873
As long as I have 
my best man, I'll be fine.

20:52.516 --> 20:53.693
I'm there for ya.

20:54.267 --> 20:56.570
- How are you guys doing in here? 
- Ready.

20:56.684 --> 20:59.820
- Good. Uh, do you have the rings? 
- Uh-oh. Oh.

21:00.173 --> 21:01.927
- Don't-- 
- Uh-oh. Shoot.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.346
This isn't fun-- don't--don't--don't do--

21:04.347 --> 21:06.094
don't--no--ugh.

21:06.144 --> 21:07.952
- I gotcha. 
- It's not funny.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.132
You'll give me a heart attack
one day, and I'll die.

21:11.133 --> 21:12.200
- Live with that. 
- Excuse me.

21:12.780 --> 21:13.836
What do you want?

21:15.377 --> 21:18.129
Oh, I almost forgot about this.

21:19.205 --> 21:20.928
They are your father's cuff links.

21:20.929 --> 21:22.704
I thought you might like to have 'em.

21:23.357 --> 21:24.336
Yeah.

21:24.337 --> 21:26.035
You nervous?

21:26.036 --> 21:27.596
You know, it's not that bad.

21:27.597 --> 21:29.295
Once you're up there with everybody--

21:29.296 --> 21:32.913
Okay, I'll be fine, mom.
You should go sit down.

21:33.121 --> 21:34.368
It's about to start.

21:34.444 --> 21:35.470
Okay.

21:40.469 --> 21:41.732
Oh.

21:44.411 --> 21:45.577
Ooh.

21:48.312 --> 21:49.721
Oh, dear.

21:49.864 --> 21:51.500
Oh, sweetie, are you okay?

21:51.501 --> 21:53.042
Yeah, thank you. I'm fine.

21:53.043 --> 21:55.463
I'm... just a little, uh--

21:55.464 --> 21:58.179
Hung over? Ugh. Been there/am there.

21:58.180 --> 22:01.112
- Uh, no. - Oh, is it the flu?
Should I keep my dtance?

22:01.113 --> 22:02.798
No, it's not the flu.

22:03.308 --> 22:06.156
Oh, preggers. Duh.

22:06.220 --> 22:07.935
Oh, babe. I'm so sorry.
I've been there, too.

22:07.936 --> 22:09.520
It's the worst.

22:09.749 --> 22:11.172
But congrats.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.147
Aunt Kitty, you're pregnant?

22:18.125 --> 22:20.215
No, Paige. No, no.

22:20.216 --> 22:21.529
I'm--I-I...

22:22.800 --> 22:25.280
What on earth are you doing in the stall?

22:26.725 --> 22:29.140
Uh, I-I-I was just...

22:29.500 --> 22:31.774
Trying to make my dress work.

22:36.169 --> 22:38.073
I'm just gonna leave you girls to it.

22:42.456 --> 22:44.587
Oh, excuse me. Have you seen my sister?
Is she in there?

22:44.588 --> 22:45.920
We really need to talk to her.

22:45.921 --> 22:48.123
Oh, I don't know. Is she the pregnant girl?

22:48.124 --> 22:52.269
- The pregnant g-- What? Pregnant?
Wait, who's pregnant? - Uh--

22:52.988 --> 22:54.396
Good luck, mom.

22:59.141 --> 23:00.043
Oh, God.

23:00.044 --> 23:01.197
No.

23:01.356 --> 23:01.988
Oh.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.548
What did Paige just say?
Did you hear her say anything?

23:04.549 --> 23:06.717
Nothing. Sh-sh-- 
What are you talking about?

23:06.718 --> 23:08.972
You look beautiful.
I'll see you out there, okay?

23:11.887 --> 23:13.931
I promise you, Paige is not pregnant.

23:13.932 --> 23:16.536
- She's got a boyfriend.
- You're insane, okay? Just breathe.

23:16.537 --> 23:19.625
- You're about to get married.
Breathe. Breathe. - Oh, holy crap.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.136
Look, come over here.
You're gonna be on my left side--

23:30.137 --> 23:31.607
Well, why do I have to
be on your left side?

23:31.608 --> 23:33.908
- Why can't I be on your right side?
- It's protocol.

23:33.909 --> 23:36.389
Protocol? Proto-- damn protocol.

23:36.529 --> 23:39.209
Luc's not talking to his mother,
his father didn't bother coming,

23:39.388 --> 23:40.500
Kitty's throwing up in the bathroom,

23:40.501 --> 23:42.708
- my daughter's probably pregnant.
- She's not pregnant. I promise.

23:42.709 --> 23:45.419
Oh, God. Okay. I just-- I need a minute.

23:45.420 --> 23:46.971
No. Sarah, everybody's waiting.

23:46.972 --> 23:48.647
Well, they're just gonna have
to wait a little bit longer,

23:48.648 --> 23:50.651
because right now, my head is full

23:50.652 --> 23:51.832
of everybody else's problems,

23:51.833 --> 23:54.633
and I don't want to say I
do feeling like this, okay?

23:54.977 --> 23:56.199
I'm gonna go for a little walk

23:56.200 --> 23:58.240
- around the block, and I will come 
right back. - No.

23:58.241 --> 24:00.096
S-Sarah.

24:29.033 --> 24:32.360
That was quick. No rice, no groom?

24:34.405 --> 24:36.276
It hasn't actually happened yet.

24:38.066 --> 24:39.632
I kind of needed a break.

24:44.980 --> 24:45.941
Want a beer?

25:07.880 --> 25:10.504
What are you doing here anyway,
parked down the block?

25:11.100 --> 25:13.997
I just wanted to see my daughter
as she came out of the church,

25:14.224 --> 25:15.536
a married woman.

25:15.953 --> 25:16.945
Really?

25:18.281 --> 25:20.552
I always had a hunch that
you were my daughter.

25:21.588 --> 25:24.245
I remember when you--you got
your high school diploma.

25:25.422 --> 25:26.383
- You were there? 
- Mm-hmm.

25:26.384 --> 25:28.305
- You were not. 
- I was.

25:29.081 --> 25:30.553
You stumbled a bit,

25:30.560 --> 25:32.128
almost fell.

25:32.966 --> 25:35.236
Yeah, I hadn't mastered my heels.

25:35.237 --> 25:37.317
No, but you made a great save.

25:37.804 --> 25:39.597
Came out of it perfect.

25:39.682 --> 25:43.027
I thought, oh, an athlete.
She's gotta be mine.

25:44.593 --> 25:48.048
And then I saw you, uh, do "Oklahoma!"...

25:48.129 --> 25:50.272
At that little theater in the park.

25:50.537 --> 25:54.536
Oh, you were a hell of a-an I-do Annie.

25:54.537 --> 25:56.939
Or whoever the hell she is.

25:56.940 --> 25:57.865
Ado.

25:57.866 --> 25:59.080
Ado.

26:01.098 --> 26:02.968
I can't believe this.

26:07.040 --> 26:08.231
That's a nice necklace.

26:08.232 --> 26:10.361
Oh, thanks.

26:10.803 --> 26:13.317
It came from my mother's jewelry box.

26:13.436 --> 26:15.132
It's my something old.

26:15.268 --> 26:16.884
- Mm-hmm. 
- She thinks it's tacky.

26:16.885 --> 26:19.444
Hmm. I always kinda liked it.

26:20.476 --> 26:23.085
Years ago, I got it from my mom...

26:23.676 --> 26:25.612
And gave it to yours.

26:27.628 --> 26:30.126
Your mom's the love of my life, you know?

26:34.813 --> 26:35.864
I'm literally having

26:35.865 --> 26:38.169
an out-of-body experience right now.

26:39.916 --> 26:41.292
Like I'm...

26:42.280 --> 26:44.537
Looking down on us both, and...

26:45.197 --> 26:46.492
What?

26:48.813 --> 26:50.989
I'm afraid I'm gonna fall.

26:52.484 --> 26:55.060
Oh, I'll catch you.

29:23.276 --> 29:24.717
- Babe. 
- Hmm.

29:24.870 --> 29:25.867
Hey, have you seen my mother?

29:25.868 --> 29:28.206
Uh, no. No, she's probably in the bathroom.

29:28.705 --> 29:29.224
Okay.

29:29.225 --> 29:31.111
- Okay? 
- I'm okay.

29:32.521 --> 29:33.167
I really thought we had

29:33.168 --> 29:35.356
a runaway bride for a minute today.

29:35.357 --> 29:39.501
Mm. Well, she's nothing
if she's not surprising.

29:41.009 --> 29:43.319
You know, Kevin, uh, and I

29:43.320 --> 29:45.785
had a surprising talk today.

29:46.573 --> 29:47.933
Well, I'm sorry.

29:48.245 --> 29:50.469
I'm sorry, but I had to tell somebody.

29:50.796 --> 29:54.123
I'm not sure you explained
my side of the story very well.

29:54.124 --> 29:55.276
Well...

30:01.172 --> 30:03.278
Mom, we--we just wanted
to say congratulations.

30:03.279 --> 30:05.681
- Oh. 
- Congratulations, Mrs. Laurent.

30:06.059 --> 30:08.040
It's Mrs. Laurent.

30:08.144 --> 30:09.696
Mrs. Laurent.

30:11.990 --> 30:14.212
Uh, hey, let's-- let's go find Olivia.

30:14.690 --> 30:15.656
Paige.

30:15.657 --> 30:16.712
Yeah.

30:18.153 --> 30:20.408
You look beautiful, honey.

30:20.549 --> 30:21.636
Thanks.

30:27.663 --> 30:30.113
Okay, guys, I've gotta get
this question out of my head.

30:30.165 --> 30:31.829
Paige is not pregnant, right?

30:32.496 --> 30:34.693
Because am I going crazy,
or are her breasts...

30:34.694 --> 30:35.862
Like, bigger?

30:38.860 --> 30:42.429
Oh. Okay, okay. Whew.

30:43.054 --> 30:45.836
So who was in the bathroom
with you two, then?

30:46.013 --> 30:48.204
- When? 
- Just now. A-a lady came out and said

30:48.205 --> 30:49.964
a girl was pregnant in the bathroom.

30:50.138 --> 30:53.306
No, I don't remember anybody
being in the bathroom with me.

30:54.041 --> 30:54.985
Huh.

30:55.144 --> 30:56.081
Excuse me.

30:59.312 --> 31:01.747
- You two okay? 
- Yeah, everything's great. How are you?

31:01.748 --> 31:03.916
- You having fun? 
- Good. Yeah, so much fun.

31:06.624 --> 31:07.462
Mom.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.617
Hey.

31:09.328 --> 31:11.394
Jean-Claude just told me 
the truth about dad.

31:12.576 --> 31:13.820
Dad is completely broke?

31:13.821 --> 31:15.150
Mom, what happened?

31:15.597 --> 31:18.540
He made some very bad business decisions.

31:18.741 --> 31:21.373
Luc, he feels so humiliated.

31:21.374 --> 31:22.476
Why didn't you tell me?

31:22.477 --> 31:25.677
Because I know how much
you admire your father.

31:26.081 --> 31:28.148
I didn't want to do anything

31:28.149 --> 31:30.645
to destroy the image you have of him.

31:31.258 --> 31:32.619
And I've already done so much

31:32.620 --> 31:34.588
to destroy the one you have of me.

31:39.965 --> 31:41.005
Not anymore.

31:42.449 --> 31:44.735
Look how fantastic this is.

31:44.826 --> 31:46.175
A cupcake pyramid--

31:46.176 --> 31:48.343
it's like their wedding was
catered by the Egyptians.

31:48.344 --> 31:49.863
What are you talking about? 
This is just--

31:49.864 --> 31:51.881
It's--it's not traditional.

31:52.714 --> 31:55.143
Oh, come on, Sauly.
Where's your sense of humor?

31:55.144 --> 31:56.631
You know what? You and I just don't have

31:56.632 --> 31:58.681
the same priorities in life, Jonathan.

31:59.345 --> 32:00.785
Oh, for God sake.

32:01.621 --> 32:03.493
Marry me, Saul.

32:04.329 --> 32:05.956
You don't believe in marriage.

32:05.957 --> 32:09.077
But you do, and I believe in you.

32:10.619 --> 32:12.240
Don't do this unless you mean business,

32:12.241 --> 32:14.272
because I might just say yes.

32:14.790 --> 32:15.953
Then say it.

32:18.832 --> 32:19.808
Yes.

32:20.537 --> 32:22.376
Why are you sitting here by yourself?

32:22.925 --> 32:24.486
I'm not sitting here by myself.

32:24.487 --> 32:27.253
I'm just... I don't know.
I'm holding down the fort.

32:28.005 --> 32:30.137
Okay, what's going on with you today?

32:30.138 --> 32:31.063
You had a stomach thing--

32:31.064 --> 32:33.124
- Are you not feeling well?
- I'm perfectly fine.

32:33.125 --> 32:36.724
But it's something, Kitty.
Tell me now. Time's up.

32:37.260 --> 32:38.413
I'm pregnant.

32:40.961 --> 32:42.049
Kitty...

32:42.513 --> 32:44.119
I know. I can't believe it either.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.217
It's unbelievable.

32:47.276 --> 32:48.172
How long have you known?

32:48.173 --> 32:50.064
Well, just a couple of days, and it's--

32:50.065 --> 32:52.696
You know, it's very complicated.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.080
What did the doctor say?

32:57.261 --> 32:59.628
Well, he's concerned. If I get sick again,

32:59.629 --> 33:02.091
I won't be able to have
the treatments that I need.

33:02.440 --> 33:05.401
But wouldn't it be amazing if Evan had,

33:05.402 --> 33:07.520
like, a little brother or a little sister?

33:07.521 --> 33:10.087
And I mean, I know Sarah drives me crazy,

33:10.088 --> 33:13.097
but I can't imagine my life without her.

33:15.156 --> 33:17.429
Well, I can't imagine my life without you.

33:17.576 --> 33:19.752
Mom, please. You sound just like Seth.

33:21.325 --> 33:23.341
So... you're gonna go through with this?

33:25.328 --> 33:26.708
I don't know.

33:27.253 --> 33:28.357
But I...

33:29.025 --> 33:30.861
I really want to.

33:39.333 --> 33:42.246
Uh, excuse me, everybody.
May I have your attention, please?

33:42.377 --> 33:43.972
- Shh. 
- Thank you.

33:43.973 --> 33:47.205
Uh, at this time, I would love to, uh,

33:47.842 --> 33:50.481
make a toast to my beautiful wife.

33:52.050 --> 33:55.821
But as you all know, 
English is not my first language,

33:55.822 --> 33:56.752
so...

33:56.753 --> 33:58.210
Ohh.

34:03.865 --> 34:04.953
So instead...

34:05.052 --> 34:05.949
Mm-hmm.

34:05.950 --> 34:08.591
I would like to do a-a
little something else.

34:09.013 --> 34:10.244
Okay.

34:12.596 --> 34:16.069

Thanks.

35:28.819 --> 35:29.651
Mm.

35:29.652 --> 35:31.013
- Hi. 
- Hey.

35:31.357 --> 35:32.380
I bet this lovely lady

35:32.381 --> 35:34.755
would like a glass of bubbly 
on her wedding day.

35:34.756 --> 35:36.786
Oh, no, thank you.
I will stick to the beer.

35:36.787 --> 35:38.278
A girl after my own heart.

35:39.504 --> 35:41.755
Listen, I-I just wanted to say,

35:41.756 --> 35:43.069
I'm glad you're here.

35:44.984 --> 35:46.128
Great party.

35:47.671 --> 35:49.112
There you are.

35:49.394 --> 35:52.145
Uh, vodka, please, 
and do not water it down.

35:52.573 --> 35:53.842
What are you doing here?

35:53.843 --> 35:55.671
Look, you can't just tell me 
you have a daughter I've never met

35:56.225 --> 35:57.802
and expect me not to be curious.

35:57.803 --> 35:59.557
I mean, I never thought
I'd be at her wedding,

35:59.586 --> 36:01.679
but by the way, it was so beautiful...

36:01.680 --> 36:03.761
And your hubby is sizzling.

36:04.028 --> 36:05.968
I'm so sorry I'm late to this.
My car broke down.

36:05.969 --> 36:09.809
- Ugh. Stupid piece-of-crap rental car.
- I'm sorry. Who are you?

36:10.145 --> 36:11.621
Lori Lynn. Your sister.

36:16.017 --> 36:17.137
You didn't tell her?

36:18.047 --> 36:19.758
Lori Lynn, please.

36:22.237 --> 36:23.355
You know what?

36:23.821 --> 36:26.072
I'm just gonna go check on those cupcakes.

36:26.073 --> 36:27.721
Great touch, by the way.

36:28.333 --> 36:29.389
Don't worry.

36:29.503 --> 36:30.561
We'll talk.

36:36.404 --> 36:37.941
I'm sorry. I...

36:39.449 --> 36:41.713
I didn't think th-- that she'd, uh...

36:41.721 --> 36:44.724
You told your daughter
about me, she was curious,

36:44.725 --> 36:47.381
so she rented a car and crashed my wedding?

36:47.950 --> 36:49.628
She's a complicated kid.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.041
I'm impressed.

37:03.074 --> 37:04.133
Hey.

37:04.134 --> 37:05.901
Hi. Are you okay?

37:07.829 --> 37:08.927
Yeah.

37:08.928 --> 37:10.177
Oh, no.

37:11.021 --> 37:12.477
Did you meet Lori Lynn?

37:13.849 --> 37:17.751
- Who? - Lori Lynn.
My youngest daughter is here.

37:18.968 --> 37:20.076
What? You're kidding.

37:20.077 --> 37:21.852
One of your three children is here?

37:21.992 --> 37:23.764
Well, actually, I have four.

37:23.765 --> 37:25.392
I thought you told me you had three.

37:25.393 --> 37:28.241
Well, five. I have five,

37:28.665 --> 37:30.313
I-if you count-- Sarah.

37:30.609 --> 37:33.153
- Yeah. 
- Yeah. Oh, God.

37:33.853 --> 37:35.860
Brody, what are we getting ourselves into?

37:35.861 --> 37:39.096
Well, my guess would be
complete and utter mayhem.

37:39.097 --> 37:40.121
Yeah.

37:40.160 --> 37:42.481
But, hey, we're all grown-ups.

37:43.193 --> 37:45.498
Yeah, well, not so you could notice.

37:45.756 --> 37:48.375
I wondered where you two had snuck off to.

37:48.541 --> 37:50.728
- What are you doing?
- Resting.

37:50.729 --> 37:53.561
Well, come on, 'cause I want
to see my parents dance.

37:54.476 --> 37:56.412
Oh, we can do that.

37:56.413 --> 37:57.280
We can?

37:57.281 --> 38:00.285
- Let's go. 
- Oh, dear God in heaven.

38:00.768 --> 38:02.036
You know, of all the weddings I've done,

38:02.037 --> 38:04.780
- this one was definitely the most-- 
- Nearly apocalyptic?

38:04.781 --> 38:06.508
No. There were a few surprises,

38:06.509 --> 38:08.436
but trust me, I have seen worse.

38:08.437 --> 38:10.405
Wait till you see us dance. Excuse me.

38:10.738 --> 38:12.241
Uh, ladies and gentlemen.

38:12.340 --> 38:13.973
Ladies and gentlemen, 
if I could have your attention.

38:13.974 --> 38:16.972
As your wedding planner extraordinaire,

38:16.973 --> 38:19.592
I'd like you all to turn your focus 
to the dance floor,

38:19.593 --> 38:23.304
where the bride and groom will
now take their first dance.

39:33.885 --> 39:34.909
Hey.

39:36.166 --> 39:38.805
I was just watching. I hope you don't mind.

39:38.852 --> 39:40.629
Uh, no. No, not at all.

39:42.288 --> 39:43.473
Justin...

39:44.659 --> 39:46.236
I've beending you mixed signals,

39:46.237 --> 39:48.092
and it's not fair.

39:48.472 --> 39:50.056
I don't care about my reputation.

39:51.537 --> 39:52.768
I care about you.

39:55.381 --> 39:56.596
You want to dance?

39:58.032 --> 39:59.008
Wow.

40:00.853 --> 40:01.941
There's one thing.

40:02.973 --> 40:04.893
I just don't think you can keep up with me.

40:05.104 --> 40:06.736
Let me be the judge of that.

40:07.133 --> 40:08.604
Oh, okay.

40:43.256 --> 40:44.392
Hi.

40:45.171 --> 40:46.369
Hi.

40:48.401 --> 40:49.537
Want to dance?

40:51.161 --> 40:52.217
Yeah.

42:02.756 --> 42:04.164
Looking back on it,

42:04.757 --> 42:06.965
I kind of think it was the best of times.

42:09.464 --> 42:11.348
Families, like life,
have a way of changing,

42:11.349 --> 42:13.563
never staying the same,
but they're your family,

42:13.564 --> 42:17.677
this eclectic, deeply bonded group.

42:17.678 --> 42:20.473
So you evolve, you adapt.

42:21.859 --> 42:22.993
And now...

42:24.297 --> 42:28.024
As I look at my life and
my new extended family,

42:29.677 --> 42:32.493
I think of this wondeul quote

42:33.457 --> 42:34.977
by George Eliot.

42:36.464 --> 42:40.833
"It's never too late to be
what you might have been."
