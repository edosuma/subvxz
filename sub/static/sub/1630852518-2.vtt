WEBVTT

00:30.238 --> 00:33.033
<i> Ah, what a nice Earth day!</i>

00:33.116 --> 00:34.576
-

00:35.869 --> 00:37.287
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

00:37.370 --> 00:39.372
-

00:39.456 --> 00:40.957
-

00:41.041 --> 00:42.375


00:43.460 --> 00:44.461
-

00:45.545 --> 00:47.213
-

00:48.006 --> 00:49.966


00:50.049 --> 00:52.969
This new skylight was a great idea.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.638
-
-Maybe not!

00:55.722 --> 00:57.557
-

00:57.640 --> 01:00.185
Drone noises?
Sisters flying away screaming?

01:00.268 --> 01:02.228
-He wants a rematch.
-No.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.606
The snacks were terrible,
the suits were limited,

01:04.689 --> 01:05.982
and we had to save Gil,

01:06.066 --> 01:07.901
who shouldn't have been there
in the first place!

01:10.653 --> 01:12.072
<i>Jonathan!</i>

01:12.155 --> 01:14.824
<i>You wanna come outside and play?</i>

01:16.242 --> 01:18.328
We want suit upgrades, better snacks,

01:18.411 --> 01:20.246
ooh, and Status Modules.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.790
<i>Forget it!</i>

01:23.708 --> 01:25.210
Wait for it…

01:26.169 --> 01:28.088
<i>OK, fine.</i>

01:29.297 --> 01:33.259
Come on, it'll be fun,
and no Gil to worry about this time.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.596
Hey, Johnny, you guys playing
a new fun arm game?

01:36.679 --> 01:38.515
No, Gil, run now, because--

01:40.892 --> 01:46.022
<i>Welcome back, gamers,</i>
<i>to real life Melee Island!</i>

01:46.105 --> 01:48.233
<i>With upgraded snacks…</i>

01:50.026 --> 01:52.779
<i>-…and upgraded…</i>

01:53.780 --> 01:57.700
Whoa, we're playing
that crazy VR game again!

01:57.784 --> 02:00.870
Oh, and the tiny mole guy is back.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.997
I'm destroying you first.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.291
<i>And upgraded suits!</i>

02:05.375 --> 02:08.962
<i>With a "zoom" button</i>
<i>for bursts of flight…</i>

02:10.046 --> 02:15.927
<i>and your new health modules</i>
<i>show you all start at 100%,</i>

02:16.010 --> 02:19.139
<i>but if your health gets to 1%,</i>

02:19.222 --> 02:22.433
<i>you will become immobile.</i>

02:22.517 --> 02:24.185
-Boo!
-Boo!

02:24.269 --> 02:28.231
<i> However, the new Reviver</i>
<i>on your hip can rescue teammates</i>

02:28.314 --> 02:31.151
<i>by giving them some of your health…</i>

02:31.234 --> 02:32.569
-Yay!
-Yay!

02:32.652 --> 02:35.905
<i> …and, as always,</i>
<i>you will be eliminated</i>

02:35.989 --> 02:38.992
<i>if you don't stay inside the Life Zone…</i>

02:39.075 --> 02:42.704
<i>as demonstrated</i>
<i>by this indigenous sea turtle.</i>

02:45.832 --> 02:47.333
That was kinda mean.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.752
<i> Mean is how you win, Johnny.</i>

02:52.505 --> 02:54.841
Am I supposed to be hurt from that look?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.719
You're just a dumb turtle.

03:00.346 --> 03:04.767
Um, we feel we should state, sir,
that cheating is… not nice.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.438
And contrary to legend, statistics show

03:08.521 --> 03:11.649
it's actually the nice guy
who finishes first.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.611
Well, let's test out your theory.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.905
You're both nice, and…

03:20.700 --> 03:22.869
Mean wins!

03:22.952 --> 03:26.247
<i> Now… let the battle begin!</i>

03:27.415 --> 03:28.625
And team up!

03:29.208 --> 03:31.294
Let's go, partner.

03:31.377 --> 03:34.380
Actually, I'm going with Vegan.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.715
What?

03:35.798 --> 03:38.092
It's just that you're so nice, and--

03:38.176 --> 03:41.596
<i>Nice guys finish last,</i>
<i>and we will destroy all of you!</i>

03:43.640 --> 03:47.060
I think one of the hardest things
in the world, sir,

03:47.143 --> 03:49.103
is to be nice.

03:49.187 --> 03:52.774
And we're gonna
kick their mean butts!

03:54.108 --> 03:56.611
Me and Susan will team up with Gil!

03:56.694 --> 03:59.364
Actually, I'm going with the cat.

03:59.447 --> 04:03.034
He's nasty, and that's
what you need to win.

04:03.117 --> 04:04.452
She's not wrong.

04:04.535 --> 04:07.247
Teammates, away!

04:08.373 --> 04:11.376
Oh, man, I am loving the switch-ups.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.962
So, who's going with this bad boy?

04:15.630 --> 04:19.133
Come on!
I will not be the first out this time,

04:19.217 --> 04:20.551
and I can be as mean as--

04:22.470 --> 04:25.390
Well, looks like
I'm on team Mole-Thing

04:25.473 --> 04:27.350
and girl-I've-never-seen-before.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.852
No! I don't want to team up!

04:30.895 --> 04:33.189
Well, this should be interesting.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.234
Oh, yeah. Now, find some weapons, Dog!

04:40.280 --> 04:42.490
I saw the big one first!

04:42.573 --> 04:44.701
<i>Yes, but I'm stronger.</i>

04:44.784 --> 04:46.369
That wasn't very nice.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.371
<i>I know.</i>

04:50.623 --> 04:53.334
Ooh… Nice shot, partner!

04:53.418 --> 04:56.921
No. Mean shot! Ha-ha!

04:59.841 --> 05:03.011
-Oh, no! We're at 1%!

05:03.094 --> 05:06.389
<i>I feel like a dumb Earth turtle</i>
<i>on its dumb back.</i>

05:10.935 --> 05:13.187
Yes! Dozer beams!

05:14.022 --> 05:17.191
-These could take out anything!

05:17.859 --> 05:20.069
-Can they?

05:20.153 --> 05:21.487
Yes.

05:27.535 --> 05:30.079
Wait, you're immune to damage?

05:30.163 --> 05:33.124
Well, you said you wanted
suit upgrades, Jonathan.

05:33.207 --> 05:36.878
So naturally,
I gave mine a damage shield,

05:36.961 --> 05:38.629
and…

05:38.713 --> 05:40.256
these!

05:41.674 --> 05:42.675
No!

05:48.973 --> 05:51.684
I took most of the damage, Johnny.

05:51.768 --> 05:55.646
Heroically saving you from that blast
has me at 1%.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.941
But don't forget, Dog, we can share!

06:01.152 --> 06:02.779
OK, I feel better.

06:04.822 --> 06:08.076
Less better. Get to higher ground!

06:13.331 --> 06:14.916
Are you stuck there, buddy?

06:18.377 --> 06:20.463
OK, let's win this.

06:21.214 --> 06:25.301
Gil… to win, we need blasters,
not sticks.

06:25.384 --> 06:28.429
I'm pretty sure this is a blaster.

06:28.513 --> 06:32.308
Then find the trigger and blast it.

06:32.391 --> 06:33.684
All right.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.062
OK, under here? No.

06:36.145 --> 06:38.106
Maybe if I carry the one…

06:38.189 --> 06:40.817
Look, I get it, the kid's a looker,

06:40.900 --> 06:44.070
but he's gonna get us blasted,
so choose.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.780
It's either him, or…

06:45.863 --> 06:47.365
me!

06:50.076 --> 06:51.702
<i> Still can't move…</i>

06:51.786 --> 06:55.289
<i>and Life Zone… almost here.</i>

06:55.373 --> 06:56.374
But wait!

06:56.457 --> 07:00.378
My loyal and nice partner can revive us.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.296
Right, buddy?

07:02.380 --> 07:07.218
Well, they do look rather pathetic,
and we are really nice.

07:07.301 --> 07:08.469
So…

07:08.553 --> 07:10.138
Fine, we'll help.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.726
Thanks! We're back in the game!

07:15.810 --> 07:17.895
<i> And you two are…</i>

07:17.979 --> 07:19.313
<i>out!</i>

07:22.775 --> 07:26.320
Darn it! Nice guys do finish last.

07:26.404 --> 07:32.493
Yes, but on Melee Island,
they're first at the snack table.

07:32.577 --> 07:36.998
Oh. My money's on Bling-Bling this time.
He's the meanest.

07:37.081 --> 07:41.002
He cheats, and his suit has
an invincibility shield.

07:41.627 --> 07:42.670
Fire!

07:45.173 --> 07:47.508
-Oh, look at that!

07:47.592 --> 07:50.386
Why, I am still at 100% health.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.513
Wait, you're cheating again?

07:52.597 --> 07:54.182
Uh, doy!

07:58.644 --> 08:01.063
Look, um, about what happened with--

08:01.147 --> 08:02.732
I'm not talking to you!

08:07.695 --> 08:09.780
-Well, whaddya know?

08:09.864 --> 08:12.700
It's my sweet, sweet Susan.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.535
Quick, get behind me.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.953
Ha-ha, right!

08:16.037 --> 08:19.624
Cos you would never blast
the love of your life.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.087
Wow, that was mean.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.255
Right?

08:26.339 --> 08:27.840
Hmm…

08:27.924 --> 08:29.342
Yeah? No?

08:29.425 --> 08:32.220
I'm telling you, this is a weapon.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.936
Oh, no. I lost my weapon stick!

08:41.062 --> 08:43.606
For what it's worth,
I'm not proud of myself today.

08:45.733 --> 08:50.196
That leaves only
my number-one nemesis and his dog.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.364
What?

08:51.447 --> 08:52.990
You again?!

08:53.074 --> 08:56.577
Now, would you please
tuck into your stupid shell

08:56.661 --> 08:59.205
and go away?!

08:59.288 --> 09:01.666
-Wait.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.417
Incoming!

09:05.044 --> 09:06.796
No! Turtle!

09:08.047 --> 09:09.465
Johnny, are you OK?

09:09.549 --> 09:11.592
-Yeah, I can't move.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.553
Oh, no. You're at 1%.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.638
-Oh, yes!

09:15.721 --> 09:20.351
Cos that means
I will finally defeat Johnny Test!

09:20.434 --> 09:22.436
Think again, Eugene.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.564
Dukey, what are you doing?

09:24.647 --> 09:27.024
You saved me from the pound once.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.569
Now I'm saving you.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.029
Uh, you know it's only a game, right?

09:32.113 --> 09:36.033
Yeah, but I don't want to miss
the tasty snacks…!

09:36.117 --> 09:37.577
Yum!

09:37.660 --> 09:39.996
That was very nice, sir.

09:40.079 --> 09:43.124
Yeah, but Bling-Bling's meanness
is still gonna win.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.835
Cos again, the suit is unstoppable!

09:45.918 --> 09:47.878
Not anymore.

09:47.962 --> 09:51.591
We can't help but be inspired
by all the niceness.

09:52.633 --> 09:56.012
So it's time for us to do the nice thing.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.766
Hey, what the…?

10:02.435 --> 10:05.146
No shield?! What's going on?

10:05.229 --> 10:07.773
Um… this!

10:11.235 --> 10:14.614
I may not have a shield
anymore, Johnny Test,

10:15.656 --> 10:17.783
but I still have…

10:18.284 --> 10:20.244
Double Arm Blasters?

10:29.378 --> 10:32.590
Ha! I still win, Johnny Test!

10:32.673 --> 10:35.926
Cos the Life Zone is gonna hit you first,

10:36.010 --> 10:39.221
and you can't move either!

10:39.305 --> 10:42.099
Wait! What? How are you moving?

10:44.143 --> 10:46.604
Not that stupid turtle!

10:47.355 --> 10:48.314
No.

10:48.397 --> 10:50.524
Cos you see, Bling-Bling,

10:50.608 --> 10:52.360
in the end,

10:52.443 --> 10:55.988
nice always beats mean.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.745
Told ya the stick was a weapon.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.914
And Johnny wins!

11:09.335 --> 11:12.505
To the king of Melee Island!

11:14.298 --> 11:17.176
Until next time, that is.
