00:06.800 --> 00:08.995
Previously on The Good Wife:

00:12.780 --> 00:16.045
WILL:
Shows your 30,000 votes
are fraudulent.

00:16.080 --> 00:17.672
So you want me to bury him?
Do what you want.

00:17.710 --> 00:19.519
I'm not owning this decision.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.716
DUBECK:
That is you and Jim Moody
conversing in private.

00:24.750 --> 00:26.354
I'm not interested in you.

00:26.390 --> 00:27.254
I want Peter Florrick.

00:27.290 --> 00:30.259
All you have to do
is testify against him.

00:32.130 --> 00:34.257
WILL:
Did you kill Dani Littlejohn?
JEFFREY: No.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.653
Is there any way your skin
could've ended up under
her fingernails?

00:35.700 --> 00:37.190
No._
Then you're Innocent.

00:37.230 --> 00:39.095
So why do I feel so nervous?

00:41.440 --> 00:43.431
("Mission District"
by The Black Angels plays)

00:57.320 --> 00:59.311
*

01:02.790 --> 01:04.781
(muffled, speaking indistinctly)

01:07.300 --> 01:09.291
(muffled, speaking indistinctly)

01:11.700 --> 01:13.691
*

01:14.800 --> 01:17.360
(muffled, speaking indistinctly)

01:27.250 --> 01:28.319
(music stops)
You all right?

01:28.350 --> 01:29.715
Now, let me tell you exactly

01:29.750 --> 01:31.411
what the defense
IS gonng to say.

01:31.450 --> 01:34.317
That the DNA can't be trusted.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.523
Mr. Gardner's gonna
pound his desk and say loudly,

01:37.560 --> 01:39.391
so that you know
that it's important,

01:39.430 --> 01:41.455
"Garbage in, garbage out."

01:41.500 --> 01:43.161
(chair rattles)

01:43.200 --> 01:45.168
Well, I'm glad Mr. Polmar gave
you a preview of my defense,

01:45.200 --> 01:46.394
it'll save me time.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.169
(scattered laughter)
You'll notice though,

01:48.200 --> 01:50.839
that I'm not pounding my desk,

01:50.870 --> 01:53.236
or yelling wildly.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.599
Simple fact is, I don't need to.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.301
I have a client who is innocent.

01:56.350 --> 01:59.410
Mr. Grant tried to rape
Dani Littlejohn

01:59.450 --> 02:01.270
and when she resisted,
he killed her.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.379
Now, how do I know
that Mr. Grant did this?

02:03.420 --> 02:04.785
_ There were no
Video cameras there.

02:04.820 --> 02:07.186
Well, luckily, science has

02:07.220 --> 02:09.450
provided its own video camera.

02:09.490 --> 02:11.321
In her last desperate moments,

02:11.360 --> 02:13.225
Dani scratched Mr. Grant,

02:13.260 --> 02:15.455
leaving his skin
under her fingernails.

02:15.500 --> 02:19.937
This young girl's brave last act
did not save her life,

02:19.970 --> 02:21.528
but it did catch her killer.

02:21.570 --> 02:23.663
Here's the thing about DNA...

02:23.710 --> 02:24.734
whatever you touch,

02:24.770 --> 02:27.432
whether you pick up a soda can,
or a garden hose,

02:27.480 --> 02:29.573
you leave a small
trace of yourself.

02:29.610 --> 02:31.407
A small trace of your DNA.

02:31.450 --> 02:32.872
There, I just left

02:32.920 --> 02:34.911
a small trace of my DNA.

02:34.950 --> 02:36.884
Now, ma'am, if you were to
touch it in the same place,

02:36.920 --> 02:40.356
a small trace of my cells
may end up on you.

02:40.390 --> 02:42.824
Now, Mr. Gardner will attempt
to explain away this DNA

02:42.860 --> 02:44.327
in many exotic ways

02:44.360 --> 02:46.328
and in fact,
like any good defense attorney,

02:46.360 --> 02:49.329
he will leave this court
and argue In another court

02:49.370 --> 02:51.463
that DNA is absolutely
infallible.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.365
Jeffrey never knew
Dani Littlejohn, never met her,

02:53.400 --> 02:55.391
never even said hello
to her on campus.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.738
Now, Mr. Grant and
Ms. Littlejohn, in fact,

02:57.770 --> 02:59.579
were members of the same
off-campus club.

02:59.610 --> 03:02.807
This club, was run by
a campus math professor,

03:02.850 --> 03:05.739
so Mr. Polmar's...
And what about
Mr. Grant's alibi?

03:05.780 --> 03:07.668
He was sleeping
in his dorm room...

03:07.720 --> 03:08.971
but no one saw him.

03:09.020 --> 03:11.215
And possibly most
damning of all,

03:11.250 --> 03:12.251
the police arrested someone else

03:12.290 --> 03:14.451
for this murder.
Objection.

03:14.490 --> 03:15.514
Come on up.

03:15.560 --> 03:16.686
That was a little
bit unsubtle.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.290
Need to keep
the jury awake.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.826
You said I couldn't mention
the man's name, Your Honor.

03:21.860 --> 03:22.895
No, I said you
couldn't mention

03:22.930 --> 03:24.591
the man himself.

03:24.630 --> 03:26.234
Your Honor, it goes to
my theory of the case.

03:26.270 --> 03:28.363
Oh, yeah, please, let's hear
the theory of the case.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.766
The police were so embarrassed
by arresting the wrong man

03:30.810 --> 03:32.437
a year earlier, they
railroaded my client.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.505
No. This isn't about
the cop's motive;

03:34.540 --> 03:36.644
this is about you putting doubt
in the mind of the jury

03:36.680 --> 03:37.772
and I want you to cut it out.

03:37.810 --> 03:38.879
Yes, Your Honor.

03:38.910 --> 03:40.411
Good. Now, are
you done?

03:40.450 --> 03:42.315
With my opening argument?
Yes, Your Honor.
Good.

03:42.350 --> 03:44.341
Now, step the hell back.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.488
You should've
taken the plea, Will.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.283
POLITI:
Okay. We're gonna
recess for lunch.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.957
I'll see you back here
in 90 minutes.
(bangs gavel)

03:50.990 --> 03:53.424
Jeffrey, remember what I said.

03:53.460 --> 03:55.951
It's a marathon,
it's not a sprint.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.399
They think I'm guilty.

03:57.430 --> 03:58.465
Everyone will think
you're guilty

03:58.500 --> 04:00.297
until I present my evidence.

04:00.340 --> 04:01.830
Hold it together
and don't look away,

04:01.870 --> 04:03.462
you meet their eyes.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.865
(phone ringing,
indistinct conversations)

04:11.050 --> 04:13.416
CARY:
Everything all right?

04:14.880 --> 04:17.986
I was just thinking, none of
this existed six months ago.

04:19.690 --> 04:22.352
CARY:
Yeah... it's a real firm.

04:23.390 --> 04:25.551
Thank you.

04:25.590 --> 04:26.955
For?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.991
Making me do this.

04:32.340 --> 04:33.637
Alicia?

04:41.840 --> 04:43.979
I'm seeing Kalinda.

04:44.010 --> 04:45.773
Yo
ul
re.. ?

04:45.810 --> 04:48.347
Yeah.

04:48.380 --> 04:50.086
Okay.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.588
Now, she's trying to
dig up stuff on our firm...

04:52.620 --> 04:53.780
SO...

04:53.820 --> 04:55.378
I thought I should
come clean to you.

04:57.060 --> 04:58.550
Okay. But...

04:58.590 --> 04:59.522
you're not giving her anything?

04:59.560 --> 05:01.050
No. No.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.421
No.
Good.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.335
You look concerned.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.599
Um... no, Ijust thought...

05:10.810 --> 05:11.959
When you say
you're seeing her...?

05:13.780 --> 05:14.804
I thought she was gay.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.604
Bi... or something.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.901
Good. None of my business.

05:18.950 --> 05:20.474
(laughs)
You think this is the way

05:20.520 --> 05:21.669
Will and Diane talk?

05:21.720 --> 05:23.642
(laughs)
We just need a shot of bourbon.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.544
I'll get some.
(laughs)

05:25.590 --> 05:26.579
What?

05:26.620 --> 05:28.485
ALIC_IA:
Justice.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.624
You want me to stay?

05:30.660 --> 05:32.696
No. That's okay.

05:36.700 --> 05:37.689
Mr. Dubeck, hello.

05:37.730 --> 05:39.027
Mrs. Florrick.

05:39.070 --> 05:40.697
I hope you don't mind
this small interruption.

05:40.740 --> 05:41.991
Would it matter if I did?

05:42.040 --> 05:44.463
It would matter to me.

05:44.510 --> 05:45.761
I won't take a minute.
I-I won't even sit.

05:45.810 --> 05:48.074
Sondra, can you call
this phone in five minutes

05:48.110 --> 05:49.771
and let me know
I have a phone call?

05:49.810 --> 05:51.573
That isn't necessary.

05:51.610 --> 05:53.874
You represented your
husband, the governor,

05:53.920 --> 05:55.547
in the legal matters
surrounding his election?

05:55.580 --> 05:57.639
I think you know
that I did.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.578
Yes. I know you did.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.156
Given that, the Office
of Public Integrity

06:01.190 --> 06:03.681
is investigating matters having
to do with a stuffed ballot box.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.584
A ballot box
I knew nothing about.

06:05.630 --> 06:07.825
A ballot box you
argued for in court.

06:07.860 --> 06:09.725
No, I argued against.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.089
Then argued for.

06:11.130 --> 06:11.960
Which is why I advise you

06:12.000 --> 06:13.558
to submit to _a_
voluntary deposmon.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.739
(laughs softl
Really? Y)

06:15.770 --> 06:16.759
You advise me?

06:16.810 --> 06:17.936
You did nothing wrong.

06:17.970 --> 06:19.574
Your husband did nothing wrong.

06:19.610 --> 06:21.908
The best way to clear this up
is to speak on the record.

06:21.940 --> 06:23.976
Or you'll leak it to the press?
(laughing): No.

06:24.010 --> 06:26.717
But... I do have a witness
who will go on the record.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.615
Another lawyer.
VVho?

06:28.650 --> 06:30.641
Will Gardner.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.516
I doubt that.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.857
If I were you, I would
get on the record first.

06:35.890 --> 06:37.687
Here's my card.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.618
Call me by this
time tomorrow.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.628
(phone ringing)

06:41.660 --> 06:44.094
I think that's
your fictional call.

06:44.130 --> 06:45.529
Talk to you soon.

06:47.470 --> 06:49.097
(phone continues ringing)

06:53.710 --> 06:56.099
We can claim with
99.9 percent certainty

06:56.140 --> 06:58.506
that this DNA
comes from Mr. Grant.

06:58.550 --> 07:00.848
POLMAR:
And did you find
any other evidence of DNA

07:00.880 --> 07:02.984
around or on the body?

07:03.020 --> 07:04.385
No. Only Mr. Grant's.

07:04.420 --> 07:07.150
And the quantity of the DNA
under the victim's ﬁngernails

07:07.190 --> 07:08.851
was consistent...

07:08.890 --> 07:10.585
with a defensive struggle?

07:10.630 --> 07:11.688
MAN:
That is correct.

07:11.730 --> 07:12.754
POLMAR:
And you'd be able to...?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.495
Where'd you get it?
Campus security.

07:14.530 --> 07:15.497
They were sympathetic.

07:15.530 --> 07:16.758
Kalinda, I could kiss you.

07:16.800 --> 07:17.824
Not here.
(laughs)

07:17.870 --> 07:19.497
Listen, I-I need to
talk to you later.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.666
Sure, about what?

07:20.700 --> 07:21.962
Later.

07:22.000 --> 07:22.864
POLMAR:
So, Mr. Vail...

07:22.910 --> 07:24.104
VAIL:
Actually, Dr. Vail.

07:24.140 --> 07:25.209
POLMAR:
My apologies, Dr. Vail.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.731
You have no doubt about
the providence of this DNA?

07:27.780 --> 07:31.739
With all DNA work, sir, we leave
ourselves a degree of doubt...

07:31.780 --> 07:34.749
but the doubt here is 0.00001.

07:34.780 --> 07:35.747
Thank you, sir.

07:35.780 --> 07:36.678
And now I believe Mr. Gardner

07:36.720 --> 07:38.745
would like to talk to you
about Touch DNA.

07:38.790 --> 07:41.714
I do! Thank you, Finn.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.557
Now that the prosecutor
has brought it up,

07:43.590 --> 07:44.454
what is Touch DNA?

07:44.490 --> 07:46.924
DNA that is transferred
via skin cells

07:46.960 --> 07:49.155
when an object is
handled or touched.

07:49.200 --> 07:50.792
And how many skin cells

07:50.830 --> 07:51.967
does a person shed every day?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.661
VAIL:
Approximately
400,000 skin cells.

07:53.700 --> 07:56.237
WILL:
Wow... that's a lot.

07:56.270 --> 07:58.761
So, if I handled this
book on my desk,

08:03.810 --> 08:05.175
Well, you told me
you'd finally read it.

08:05.210 --> 08:06.973
(scattered laughter)

08:07.020 --> 08:09.739
Now, ifI handled this book...

08:09.790 --> 08:11.587
and I hand it to you...

08:11.620 --> 08:12.757
am I transferring cells?

08:12.790 --> 08:13.688
VAIL:
You could be.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.654
You would have to
hold it for some time

08:15.690 --> 08:16.987
and it would be
a better absorbent

08:17.030 --> 08:18.156
if the cover were cloth.

08:18.190 --> 08:20.226
As this one is?

08:20.260 --> 08:21.659
Yes.

08:21.700 --> 08:22.962
That would
transfer your cells.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.025
Your Honor, I've had some
late arriving evidence

08:25.070 --> 08:26.219
and unfortunately, I haven't
had time to put it on slides.

08:26.270 --> 08:27.168
That's all right.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.838
We can struggle without
technology today.

08:28.870 --> 08:32.306
The last day of
Dani Littlejohn's life,

08:32.340 --> 08:34.001
she checked out a research book

08:34.040 --> 08:36.747
from _her advanced
socrology class.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.805
This is her at 3:25 p.m.,

08:38.850 --> 08:40.647
as seen from the library
surveillance cameras.

08:40.680 --> 08:41.669
Do you see her there?

08:41.720 --> 08:42.982
VAIL: I do.
Now,

08:43.020 --> 08:43.918
this was a book

08:43.950 --> 08:46.282
all the sociology classes
needed to share,

08:46.320 --> 08:48.880
so a student couldn't take it
out of the library,

08:48.920 --> 08:50.581
they had to return it after
reading the chapter...

08:50.630 --> 08:51.949
Mr. Gardner appears to be
testifying here,

08:51.990 --> 08:53.696
Your Honor.
He does at that.

08:53.730 --> 08:54.549
Is there a question

08:54.600 --> 08:55.726
swimming around
in all those statements?

08:55.760 --> 08:56.897
Yes, Your Honor.

08:56.930 --> 08:59.592
A few hours earlier, at 12:39,

08:59.640 --> 09:01.892
the sa book was checked out
by this person.

09:01.940 --> 09:03.168
Do you recognize him?

09:03.210 --> 09:04.234
It looks like Jeffrey Grant.

09:04.270 --> 09:05.908
It is, actually.

09:05.940 --> 09:07.737
Now, this sociology book,

09:07.780 --> 09:10.203
an old book,
had a cloth cover.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.048
Is it possible,
that the DNA at question here,

09:13.080 --> 09:17.210
was transferred via
the cloth cover of this book?

09:17.250 --> 09:18.911
It could, but to get under
the victim's fingernails,

09:18.950 --> 09:21.111
she would've had to
grip the book quite tightly.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.787
Yes, but as you say,
it's possible.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.980
It's certainly possible.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.923
Can you see that, Mr. Polmar?

09:28.960 --> 09:31.861
I can, Mr. Gardner, thank you.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.631
He wanted an answer in 24 hours?

09:36.670 --> 09:38.069
Or he'll depose Will.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.328
It's a bluff.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.042
Will won't break
attorney-client prIVIlege.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.604
What if they
offer him immunity?

09:44.650 --> 09:45.878
For what?

09:45.910 --> 09:47.912
Conspiracy to
commit voter fraud.

09:47.950 --> 09:49.315
He saw a videotape.

09:49.350 --> 09:52.114
He argued
against the votes, too.

09:52.150 --> 09:54.015
Yeah, but he buried that video.

09:54.060 --> 09:56.255
I think I should do it.

09:56.290 --> 09:58.781
The voluntary deposition?

09:58.830 --> 10:00.195
It's the only way
to control the questions.

10:00.230 --> 10:02.790
I'm in my rights
to answer any questions

10:02.830 --> 10:06.027
I want and refuse any
clue to attorney-client
privilege.

10:06.070 --> 10:08.061
Even ifI refuse_
to answer any questions,

10:08.100 --> 10:10.136
I will know
what he's asking Will.

10:10.170 --> 10:11.728
Good, good.

10:11.770 --> 10:13.169
Do you need a lawyer?

10:13.210 --> 10:15.303
No, I have Cary.

10:15.340 --> 10:16.876
(scoffs):
Cary Agos?

10:16.910 --> 10:18.070
You sure he's up to it?

10:18.110 --> 10:20.840
He's up to it.

10:24.420 --> 10:25.819
What do you have?

10:25.850 --> 10:27.408
Me? Nothing. You know,

10:27.460 --> 10:30.054
just a song in my heart.

10:30.090 --> 10:31.421
Damn it.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.223
POLMAR: _
Thank you for returning,
Doctor.

10:33.260 --> 10:38.721
Now, if you wanted to avoid
leaving Touch DNA,

10:38.770 --> 10:39.896
how could you do it?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.737
VAIL: If I wanted to avoid it?
Uh-huh.

10:41.770 --> 10:43.829
Well, the best way
would be to remove

10:43.870 --> 10:45.906
the top layer
of dead cells on your skin.

10:45.940 --> 10:47.828
Through washing hands?
Yes.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.849
Or some kind of solvent
or alcohol-based cleanser.

10:50.880 --> 10:51.972
Or chlorine?

10:52.010 --> 10:55.173
Yes. A chlorine-based wash
would be quite effective.

10:55.220 --> 10:57.245
Wouldn't chlorine also be
effective at washing away

10:57.290 --> 11:00.088
any result from Touch DNA?
Yes, it would.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.257
My apologies,
Your Honor.

11:01.290 --> 11:03.224
This evidence arrived so late,

11:03.260 --> 11:06.229
I, too, didn't have time
to transfer it to a monitor.

11:06.260 --> 11:09.991
It's like Perry Mason here with
all this late-arriving stuff.

11:10.030 --> 11:11.861
Go ahead.

11:11.900 --> 11:14.994
Would you please tell me
who you see in this photo, sir?

11:15.040 --> 11:16.928
It looks like the victim,
Dani Littlejohn.

11:16.970 --> 11:19.006
It is in fact. _
At the college swrmmlng pool.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.838
Could you tell me the timecode

11:21.880 --> 11:22.699
of the campus
surveillance camera?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.775
It says 5:12.
...p.m., that's right.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.914
So this would be after

11:26.950 --> 11:29.145
Mr. Gardner's library photo
of Ms. Littlejohn

11:29.180 --> 11:30.818
handling the cloth
sociology book?

11:30.850 --> 11:32.249
Yes, an hour
and a half later.

11:32.290 --> 11:34.019
Let me take this by the jury.

11:34.060 --> 11:38.178
So, if Ms. Littlejohn went
swimming in a chlorinated pool,

11:38.230 --> 11:40.892
after she'd handled the book
positively doused

11:40.930 --> 11:42.488
with Touch DNA, would that
eliminate any effects

11:42.530 --> 11:43.997
of Touch DNA on her body?

11:44.030 --> 11:45.099
It would, definitely.

11:45.130 --> 11:47.792
And so the DNA underneath
Ms. Littlejohn's fingernails

11:47.840 --> 11:48.932
would still most likely come

11:48.970 --> 11:50.858
from a defensive wound
that night.

11:50.910 --> 11:52.878
Objection! Beyond the scope.

11:52.910 --> 11:55.003
Sure, you can have that one.
Sustained.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.405
Did you have
any more questions?

11:56.440 --> 11:58.169
It's my fault.
I should have checked.

11:58.210 --> 11:59.279
We gotta start over.

11:59.310 --> 12:00.914
How did his DNA
end up on her?

12:00.950 --> 12:02.042
Okay, I'm on it.

12:21.470 --> 12:23.233
(phones ringing)

12:23.270 --> 12:25.261
(speaking indistinctly)

12:36.520 --> 12:38.488
WILL:
It's somewhere in here.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.489
Dani Littlejohn got out
of the campus pool at 5:12.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.329
Jeffrey Grant's card key
has him entering

12:43.360 --> 12:45.328
his dorm room at 7:49 pm.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.920
They had to cross
somewhere in there. Kalinda?

12:47.960 --> 12:50.224
So Grant had his baseball game
at 6:30.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.830
He was injured at 7:00.
Went to the emergency room

12:52.870 --> 12:54.167
and was released at 7:30.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.533
Did they cross at the hospital?

12:57.570 --> 13:00.209
Uh, there was no record
of Dani visiting the hospital.

13:00.240 --> 13:01.468
So beat the bushes.

13:01.510 --> 13:03.273
What were Dani Littlejohn's
exact movements

13:03.310 --> 13:05.471
from her swim until
the time of her death?

13:05.510 --> 13:07.944
And how could Jeffrey have
crossed with her? Let's go!

13:09.480 --> 13:11.243
You're starting over?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.315
We had a setback.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.009
We're putting eight
associates on it?

13:15.060 --> 13:16.857
WILL:
Yes.

13:16.890 --> 13:17.879
Hold on, Kalinda.

13:17.930 --> 13:21.093
What about the earlier
suspect, the professor?

13:21.130 --> 13:23.860
Dr. Delaney? The judge won't
allow any mention of him.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.322
Do we think he did it?

13:25.370 --> 13:26.359
Who, Jeffrey?

13:26.400 --> 13:28.459
No, the professor.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.967
Uh...

13:30.010 --> 13:31.966
Do we think
Jeffrey did it?

13:32.910 --> 13:36.607
I-I don't know.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.471
Well, what is the
plea on the table?

13:38.510 --> 13:40.478
It's off the table.
Jeffrey rejected it.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.249
What was the plea
on the table?

13:42.280 --> 13:44.282
Eight years.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.512
You think I've lost
my perspective?

13:48.560 --> 13:50.858
No, I just think eight years
is preferable to life.

13:50.890 --> 13:53.427
Jeffrey is 21.
He'll be out before
his 30th birthday.

13:53.460 --> 13:54.495
He rejected it.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.123
I better go.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.068
No, you're fine, Kalinda.

13:59.100 --> 14:01.193
Well, your defense seems

14:01.240 --> 14:02.639
to be taking for granted
his innocence.

14:02.670 --> 14:06.265
What if he's not?
What's your fallback?

14:06.310 --> 14:07.971
The jury believed Touch DNA.

14:08.010 --> 14:10.001
They looked at Jeffrey
and they wanted

14:10.050 --> 14:11.449
to believe
he didn't do it.

14:11.480 --> 14:15.075
All we need to do is hint
at cross between Jeffrey

14:15.120 --> 14:18.317
and the victim somewhere
where his DNA could
have ended up on her.

14:18.350 --> 14:20.887
This isn't a crusade, Diane.
I like the kid.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.387
I think he's innocent.

14:22.420 --> 14:25.389
I feat bad he's having the crap
beaten out of him in holding,

14:25.430 --> 14:26.624
but I'm playing this smart.

14:28.630 --> 14:32.589
Okay. Tell me
if you need my help.

14:32.630 --> 14:34.962
I'll be in the courtroom
down from yours.
On what?

14:35.000 --> 14:38.504
The hedge fund-- Vonerich.
Another DUI.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.337
Keeping the world safe
for drunk CEOs.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.268
(laughs)
It's my new motto.

14:42.310 --> 14:46.144
Are, uh, are they okay?
Jeffrey's parents?

14:48.550 --> 14:50.142
ALICIA:
I understand, Mr. Grant,

14:50.190 --> 14:52.988
I know,
but your son is mid-trial.

14:54.490 --> 14:57.220
The Grants. Their son-_-
they want a second opInIon.

14:57.260 --> 15:00.696
Uh, no, I'm sorry.
Look, Will Gardner is

15:00.730 --> 15:02.527
Lockhart/Gardner's
top litigator.

15:02.560 --> 15:06.667
No, I'm sorry, sir,
but you're in good hands.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.065
Thank you.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.239
Wow, you were laying it
on thick.

15:10.270 --> 15:11.430
Just cooling things down.

15:11.470 --> 15:15.236
So... will you?

15:15.280 --> 15:16.679
You want me as your lawyer?
Yeah.

15:16.710 --> 15:19.042
Why? You sound incredulous.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.638
Wouldn't you want me
as you lawyer?

15:20.680 --> 15:22.545
Um...

15:22.580 --> 15:23.683
Whoa.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.608
I'm joking, I'm joking!

15:25.650 --> 15:26.685
Yes!

15:26.720 --> 15:28.278
Yes.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.651
I'll arrange a date and time
for the deposition.

15:29.690 --> 15:30.657
Good.

15:30.690 --> 15:32.555
I have the correspondents'
luncheon tomorrow.

15:32.590 --> 15:33.955
Sometime before that?
Okay.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.251
Where you going?
Court.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.619
You offering a second opinion?

15:40.140 --> 15:43.405
KALINDA:
You were with D_ani on that
last day SWImmIng, right?

15:43.440 --> 15:44.600
WOMAN:
I was.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.301
And afterward.

15:46.340 --> 15:47.568
What did you guys do afterward?

15:47.610 --> 15:50.147
She met me at the study hall.

15:50.180 --> 15:52.171
You ever see this person there?

15:52.210 --> 15:54.576
No, but it's a big campus.
Of course.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.509
And do you know where Dani went
after that?

15:57.550 --> 16:00.678
No. She just finished
her coffee and headed off.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.381
Uh, coffee? She had a coffee?

16:03.430 --> 16:04.681
Like a Starbucks coffee?

16:04.730 --> 16:06.686
No, a campus one.

16:09.230 --> 16:11.664
Okay, Kalinda, thanks.
Keep on it.

16:11.700 --> 16:14.760
Jeffrey, we may have a lead
on Dani's whereabouts.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.701
We think she was buying coffee
at the campus coffee shop

16:17.740 --> 16:20.709
around 5:30 or so.
Were you there?

16:20.740 --> 16:22.503
Let me say this
before you answer.

16:22.540 --> 16:25.179
We need to find someplace
your Touch DNA could've ended up

16:25.210 --> 16:26.541
under Dani's fingernails
after her swimming,

16:26.580 --> 16:30.289
and all we can find
is this coffee shop.
So I have to ask you again,

16:30.320 --> 16:34.188
were you in this coffee shop
around that time?

16:34.220 --> 16:36.017
It makes sense
that you would be.

16:36.060 --> 16:39.086
I'm gonna say yes.
I don't remember.

16:39.130 --> 16:40.097
But you might have?

16:40.130 --> 16:41.392
I might have.

16:41.430 --> 16:42.351
Good. Let me run with that.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.721
The more you firm up your memory
the better.

16:44.770 --> 16:48.194
You still having trouble
in holding?

16:48.240 --> 16:49.696
Yeah.

16:49.740 --> 16:51.560
I can talk to someone.

16:51.610 --> 16:54.374
No, they'll just put me
in solitary.

16:54.410 --> 16:57.447
I'd kill myself
in solitary.

17:07.320 --> 17:08.719
RODRIGUEZ:
This is the dorm here.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.455
POLMAR:
Mr. Grant's dorm?

17:10.490 --> 17:11.650
Yes. And the body
was discovered here.

17:11.690 --> 17:15.490
Now, you found that Mr. Grant's
card key had logged him in

17:15.530 --> 17:18.829
at 7:49 p.m., but the murder
didn't happen until 9:15.

17:18.870 --> 17:20.235
How do you
explain this?

17:20.270 --> 17:22.363
This door here,
it's a fire exit,

17:22.400 --> 17:24.334
but students keep it propped
open with a chair.

17:24.370 --> 17:27.476
This is how Mr. Grant could have
had access to the crime scene

17:27.510 --> 17:29.273
while bypassing
the card key system.

17:29.310 --> 17:30.777
And did you check out
Mr. Grant's alibi?

17:30.810 --> 17:32.539
That he was in his
dorm room sleeping?

17:32.580 --> 17:34.218
Yes, there were no witnesses.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.717
Thank you, Detective.
Nothing further.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.547
Detective, why did it take you
a year

17:37.590 --> 17:39.410
to catch my client?

17:39.450 --> 17:41.714
Why? We were being careful.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.684
But you must've questioned
students in this dorm

17:44.730 --> 17:46.288
building with
the propped-open door?

17:46.330 --> 17:47.354
No.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.618
You didn't? Why was that?

17:49.660 --> 17:51.764
We were pursuing another lead.
I see.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.734
So it took you a year
to find my client.

17:53.770 --> 17:55.294
Well, you must have been
very busy.

17:55.340 --> 17:56.830
Yes, we were.
You were busy
with other cases?

17:56.870 --> 17:58.406
And this case.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.670
It takes you a while to
clear cases, is that it?

18:00.710 --> 18:02.268
Look, we had someone else
in our sights.

18:02.310 --> 18:03.277
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

18:03.310 --> 18:04.402
I didn't
bring it up!

18:04.450 --> 18:05.747
He cowed the witness
into defending...

18:05.780 --> 18:07.475
I didn't cow anyone!
He volunteered!

18:07.520 --> 18:09.738
JUDGE:
Come on up.

18:12.820 --> 18:14.651
The witness brought up
the other suspect

18:14.690 --> 18:16.317
to defend his inactivity.
After being badgered,

18:16.360 --> 18:17.679
Your Honor.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.254
I would agree, Mr. Polmar,

18:19.290 --> 18:21.292
but it's now part of Detective
Rodriguez's testimony.

18:21.330 --> 18:22.729
Thank you, Your Honor.

18:22.760 --> 18:25.820
Don't suck up. Step back.

18:31.770 --> 18:32.907
Detective,

18:32.940 --> 18:35.534
who was this first
suspect you pursued?

18:35.580 --> 18:38.674
Dr. Stephan Delaney. He's a math
professor at Chicago Poly-Tech.

18:38.710 --> 18:40.746
I see. And why did you
first suspect him?

18:46.790 --> 18:47.916
What's going on?

18:47.960 --> 18:52.226
The Grants called _me
for a second opinion
on your trial.

18:52.260 --> 18:53.557
You're kidding me.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.556
No. I told them no.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.862
Then why are you here?

18:58.900 --> 19:00.265
I decided to warn you.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.860
I was thinking if
I was in your shoes

19:02.900 --> 19:05.835
and I had a client
calling behind my back,

19:05.870 --> 19:07.599
I would want to know.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.674
Alicia.

19:18.550 --> 19:19.642
Thanks.

19:19.690 --> 19:22.750
Hey, we might have
our differences,

19:22.790 --> 19:23.927
but you're the better lawyer.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.928
(chuckles)
I am, aren't I?

19:25.960 --> 19:28.497
(laughs)

19:28.530 --> 19:30.669
And the more humble.

19:34.470 --> 19:36.392
WILL:
Mr. and Mrs. Grant,

19:36.440 --> 19:38.806
if you want another lavwer,
I'll get you a list
of other lawyers,

19:38.840 --> 19:40.603
but don't go behind my back.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.278
Not during trial.
Do you understand?

19:44.910 --> 19:47.242
We were just nervous.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.874
I understand that. We all are.
Do you want to make a change?

19:49.920 --> 19:51.808
No.

19:51.850 --> 19:53.818
No.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.351
Good.

19:56.390 --> 19:57.550
POLMAR:
Thank you, Dr. Delaney.

19:57.590 --> 20:00.957
Now, why did Dani Littlejohn
stop coming to your B-Plus Club?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.558
Well, she stopped getting
B-pluses.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.795
(scattered chuckles)

20:04.830 --> 20:06.923
And did she express her worry
about another student

20:06.970 --> 20:08.790
in the club?
Yes.
Jeffrey Grant.

20:08.840 --> 20:09.898
That is
such a lie.

20:09.940 --> 20:10.907
POLITI:
Mr. Grant,

20:10.940 --> 20:12.362
not another word.

20:12.410 --> 20:13.502
WILL: _
Our apologies,
Your Honor.

20:13.540 --> 20:15.428
POLMAR:
But Mr. Grant insists

20:15.480 --> 20:17.448
that he never met
Dani Littlejohn.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.448
To your knowledge,
would that be false?

20:19.480 --> 20:21.573
I'm sorry, but to my knowledge
that is false.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.939
They were both
in my B-Plus Club

20:22.980 --> 20:24.481
and, I believe,
socialized there.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.612
POLMAR:
Now, let me
just ask you

20:25.650 --> 20:26.981
this question, because
I know Mr. Gardner's

20:27.020 --> 20:28.385
chomping at the bit

20:28.420 --> 20:29.387
and I don't want
to disappoint him.

20:29.420 --> 20:31.354
Did you kill

20:31.390 --> 20:32.823
Dani Littlejohn?
No.

20:32.860 --> 20:33.849
POLMAR:
But the police
questioned you.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.855
DELAN EY:
Yes.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.458
I was the last one to see her.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.467
Alive.

20:37.500 --> 20:38.797
She was in my
study group.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.297
But you have an alibi?
Yes.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.693
At the time of Dani's death,

20:41.740 --> 20:42.798
I was with my ex-wife.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.933
POLMAR:
Your ex-wife.

20:44.970 --> 20:46.801
Thank you,
Dr. Delaney.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.637
MAN:
Oh, yeah.

20:48.680 --> 20:49.635
That's...
that girl...

20:49.680 --> 20:50.647
KALIN DA:
Dani Littlejohn.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.476
Right.

20:51.510 --> 20:53.319
Uh, do you remember
the day she died?

20:53.350 --> 20:54.840
Oh, yeah.
Last year.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.416
That was... awful.

20:56.450 --> 20:57.439
She used to come in a lot.

20:57.490 --> 20:58.843
And you were working
that afternoon.

20:58.890 --> 21:00.551
Uh, yeah.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.455
1:00 to 7:00.
Right.

21:02.490 --> 21:03.752
What time _did
she come In?

21:03.790 --> 21:04.927
Dani?
Yeah.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.257
Uh, she didn't come in.
Not that day.

21:07.460 --> 21:09.519
She didn come in?

21:09.560 --> 21:10.959
Uh... look,
are you sure?

21:11.000 --> 21:12.558
Because we have someone
who Witnessed her

21:12.600 --> 21:13.897
with a coffee cup
that came from here.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.567
Yeah, I saw her
standing outside,

21:15.600 --> 21:17.033
but a friend of hers
brought her the coffee.

21:17.070 --> 21:19.004
Do you remember seeing

21:19.040 --> 21:20.064
this student out there, too?

21:20.110 --> 21:21.338
Yeah, I
know him.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.507
But he wasn't
outside with her.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.676
But you can't be sure.

21:24.710 --> 21:26.348
No, I'm...
pretty sure.

21:26.380 --> 21:27.415
Right.

21:27.450 --> 21:28.678
(knocking)

21:28.720 --> 21:30.312
Sorry.

21:30.350 --> 21:32.443
I can lie,
if you want.

21:32.490 --> 21:34.515
If you want me to say
I saw them together.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.516
It's fine.

21:42.900 --> 21:44.993
Will, it's bad news.

21:58.550 --> 22:00.575
WILL: Did you check the
surveillance video?
Yeah.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.770
Littlejohn's roommate
went into the coffee shop...

22:02.820 --> 22:04.845
she stayed outside.

22:04.890 --> 22:06.687
Maybe she ran into
Jeffrey outside.

22:07.920 --> 22:10.059
Will...

22:10.090 --> 22:11.022
I think he did it.

22:12.590 --> 22:13.898
The murder weapon,
the cinder block...

22:13.930 --> 22:15.124
how much
did it weigh?

22:15.160 --> 22:17.025
About 18 pounds.

22:17.060 --> 22:18.493
Check with Jeffrey's doctor.

22:18.530 --> 22:20.691
He was injured pitching
that night, right?

22:20.740 --> 22:22.560
The doctor who examined him.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.567
Maybe he
couldn't lift it.

22:23.610 --> 22:25.009
Okay, I'll ask.
Good.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.962
What's up with you?

22:27.010 --> 22:28.375
Hmm?

22:28.410 --> 22:29.399
You wanted to talk?

22:31.750 --> 22:33.741
Yeah.

22:36.150 --> 22:38.038
How long do you need
to replace me?

22:38.090 --> 22:40.081
How long do I need?

22:41.460 --> 22:42.757
You're leaving?

22:42.790 --> 22:45.054
Yeah.

22:47.830 --> 22:48.990
You going to Florrick-Agos?

22:49.030 --> 22:50.054
No.

22:50.100 --> 22:51.465
Then what?

22:51.500 --> 22:53.058
Just, I wanted to...

22:53.100 --> 22:54.590
I don't know, wanted to do
something different.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.631
What, farming?

22:59.510 --> 23:02.536
Will, I don't want to be doing
this for the next 20 years.

23:09.150 --> 23:10.481
This isn't about money?

23:10.520 --> 23:12.613
Nope.

23:12.650 --> 23:13.981
Is it about Alicia?

23:14.020 --> 23:15.817
Is... What?

23:15.860 --> 23:17.851
Her leaving.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.057
No.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.159
Okay.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.124
I'm gonna be honest.

23:26.170 --> 23:28.468
You know this is crap.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.660
I know this is crap.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.133
Every few months,
you do this.

23:31.170 --> 23:32.432
And this time, I am serious.

23:32.470 --> 23:33.835
You and I were built
for this, Kalinda.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.131
It's what we do.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.000
Now, we can look
at normal people

23:37.040 --> 23:40.100
and want to be like them...

23:40.150 --> 23:41.549
but we can't, really.

23:42.720 --> 23:45.143
Is that supposed
to be a pep talk?

23:45.190 --> 23:46.942
Because it's terrible.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.059
(both laughing)

23:48.090 --> 23:49.079
Okay, look...

23:49.120 --> 23:50.826
you take a few months off.

23:50.860 --> 23:51.827
Go have a life.

23:51.860 --> 23:53.179
But I'm telling you right now:

23:53.230 --> 23:55.152
you will be bored sick.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.952
Life is overrated, and

23:57.000 --> 23:58.991
you'll miss it.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.100
That feeling you get

24:03.140 --> 24:05.131
when you figure
something out...

24:08.910 --> 24:11.504
You live for that.

24:11.550 --> 24:14.974
Anyway... I'll miss you.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.042
There aren't many
people I like left.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.682
There.

24:21.190 --> 24:22.179
Was that a better pep talk?

24:25.130 --> 24:27.086
It's okay.

24:28.930 --> 24:30.022
You want a hug?

24:30.060 --> 24:31.095
(chuckles)

24:31.130 --> 24:33.121
(quietly):
Stupid.

24:34.940 --> 24:36.532
DUBECK:
Good morning,
Mrs. Florrick.

24:36.570 --> 24:37.730
Mr. Dubeck.

24:37.770 --> 24:39.169
According to our pre-agreed
ground rules,

24:39.210 --> 24:41.030
I will be taping

24:41.080 --> 24:43.503
this deposition...
Voluntary deposition.

24:43.550 --> 24:45.848
Yes. Voluntary
deposition.

24:45.880 --> 24:48.542
And we've agreed to review
and correct any mistakes

24:48.580 --> 24:50.218
in the fine copy.
And...

24:50.250 --> 24:52.548
(beeping)
I will be taping
this interview, also.

24:52.590 --> 24:54.114
Good.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.058
So, then, we're...

24:55.090 --> 24:57.115
all ready?

24:57.160 --> 24:59.219
(microphone beeps)
We seem to be.

24:59.260 --> 25:00.989
Okay. Did
you discuss

25:01.030 --> 25:02.759
your voluntary deposition

25:02.800 --> 25:04.097
with anyone before today?

25:04.130 --> 25:05.791
Yes.
VVho?

25:05.830 --> 25:07.195
Eli Gold,

25:07.230 --> 25:09.664
my husband,
Governor Peter Florrick,

25:09.700 --> 25:10.837
and my lawyer,
Cary Agos.

25:10.870 --> 25:12.303
Did you discuss it
with Will Gardner, too?

25:12.340 --> 25:14.228
No.
Really?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.635
Because you were observed

25:16.680 --> 25:18.045
meeting with Will
Gardner yesterday,

25:18.080 --> 25:20.105
Tuesday the 15th, at the
criminal courthouse.

25:20.150 --> 25:21.139
I was "ob
served"?

25:21.180 --> 25:22.716
Yes.
When I was

25:22.750 --> 25:24.889
being followed,
I was "observed"?

25:26.890 --> 25:28.983
Yes.
Mm-hmm.

25:29.020 --> 25:31.955
And for how long have I been
being... "observed"?

25:33.360 --> 25:35.055
35 hours.

25:35.100 --> 25:37.125
And will I continue
to be "observed"?

25:37.160 --> 25:38.889
I don't know.
CARY:
I will be readying

25:38.930 --> 25:40.090
an order of protection
right after this meeting.

25:41.340 --> 25:45.003
So you met with
Will Gardner yesterday,

25:45.040 --> 25:46.667
but you did not discuss
your testimony with him?

25:46.710 --> 25:48.678
Her "interview" with him.
That's correct.

25:48.710 --> 25:50.575
I didn't
discuss it.
What did you discuss?

25:50.610 --> 25:51.577
His current
murder trial.

25:51.610 --> 25:53.168
I told him

25:53.210 --> 25:55.678
that the parents of his client

25:55.720 --> 25:57.142
came to me for a second opinion.

25:57.180 --> 26:00.240
When your men are trailing me

26:00.290 --> 26:01.587
and they're too
far away to hear,

26:01.620 --> 26:02.757
just have them signal

26:02.790 --> 26:04.223
and I'll talk louder.

26:06.090 --> 26:07.227
Did Will _Gardner show
you this Videotape?

26:11.400 --> 26:13.891
No.
He didn't?

26:13.940 --> 26:15.669
No.

26:15.700 --> 26:17.292
You'll have to excuse
my Incredullty,

26:17.340 --> 26:20.229
but it seems to me that
you and Mr. Gardner share...

26:20.270 --> 26:21.237
almost everything.

26:23.910 --> 26:27.141
Your incredulity...

26:27.180 --> 26:29.216
is excused.

26:34.820 --> 26:36.253
Do you have any other questions,

26:36.290 --> 26:37.279
Mr. Dubeck,
or is that it?

26:37.320 --> 26:38.719
I was just giving Mrs. Florrick

26:38.760 --> 26:40.284
a chance to reconsider
her response.

26:40.330 --> 26:42.252
No, I'm good.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.639
You and Mr. Gardner
are lovers,

26:48.670 --> 26:50.137
isn't that
correct?
CARY:
Excuse me.

26:50.170 --> 26:51.398
What does that have
to do with anything?

26:51.440 --> 26:53.237
The relationship
between two lawyers

26:53.270 --> 26:54.806
on Governor Florrick's
legal team

26:54.840 --> 26:56.171
bears a direct
relationship to...
No.

26:56.210 --> 26:57.302
CARY:
No, it does not.

26:57.340 --> 26:59.308
And I'm calling a halt to
this interview right now.

26:59.350 --> 27:01.841
It's okay, Cary.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.745
Mr. Dubeck...

27:03.790 --> 27:06.179
I've been at this now
for fIve years.

27:06.220 --> 27:08.916
Investigations,
recriminations,

27:08.960 --> 27:10.211
personal questions, innuendo.

27:10.260 --> 27:12.888
And every time--

27:12.930 --> 27:15.319
every single time--

27:15.360 --> 27:17.920
I know the investigator
is in trouble

27:17.970 --> 27:19.323
when he makes it personal...

27:19.370 --> 27:21.031
just as you
did now.

27:21.070 --> 27:24.164
I know that he
doesn't have the facts.

27:26.310 --> 27:29.177
You're losing, Mr. Dubeck.

27:32.780 --> 27:35.010
Any other questions?

27:35.050 --> 27:37.018
WOMAN:
Yes, Jeffrey Grant,
the guy on trial.

27:37.050 --> 27:38.017
He was in here.

27:38.050 --> 27:39.187
And you
treated him?

27:39.220 --> 27:40.312
Yes, I treated
him. Why?

27:40.350 --> 27:41.214
He had
a sprain?

27:41.260 --> 27:43.080
Oh, yes, he was in
quite a bit of pain.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.189
His right arm.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.424
Do you think he
could've lifted this?

27:45.460 --> 27:47.223
It's about 18 pounds.

27:47.260 --> 27:48.227
DOCTOR:
Mm, he might
be able to,

27:48.260 --> 27:49.454
with difficulty.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.229
It would be painful.

27:51.270 --> 27:53.192
Is this about the murder?

27:53.230 --> 27:54.788
Yeah.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.193
I treated her that night, too.

27:56.240 --> 27:57.195
Sorry, you...

27:57.240 --> 27:59.367
you treated...
Dani Littlejohn?

27:59.410 --> 28:00.160
Yes.

28:00.210 --> 28:02.371
You treated both
Dani and Jeffrey?

28:02.410 --> 28:03.707
Yes.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.149
Excuse me.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.819
DOCTOR: Okay, sir,
now, this may hurt.

28:11.850 --> 28:13.181
(inhales sharply)
I know.

28:13.220 --> 28:14.482
I'm sorry. Let's get
him up to X ray

28:14.520 --> 28:16.852
on the third floor,
and then we'll determine

28:16.890 --> 28:18.289
if he needs to go
to surgery or not.
Um...

28:18.330 --> 28:19.285
Doctor...

28:19.330 --> 28:20.285
Sorry, Doctor.

28:20.330 --> 28:22.355
When Jeffrey was
brought in here,

28:22.400 --> 28:24.288
did you examine
him in here?
Sorry, I'm a
little busy.

28:24.330 --> 28:25.797
Just one question.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.161
Was Jeffrey examined
in the emergency room?

28:27.200 --> 28:28.235
Uh, yes.

28:28.270 --> 28:29.089
Right.
And Dani Littlejohn...

28:29.140 --> 28:30.391
when she was brought in,
where was she?

28:30.440 --> 28:32.169
In the operating
theatre downstairs.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.474
Yeah, but was she ever
on any of these beds?

28:35.840 --> 28:36.875
We change the sheets

28:36.910 --> 28:38.207
on these beds
after every patient.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.343
I understand that, but is-is
there any way, Doctor,

28:40.380 --> 28:42.439
that Jeffrey's sheets
from earlier on that night

28:42.480 --> 28:44.414
could've come
into contaﬁt with Dani?
o.

28:44.450 --> 28:45.712
Would you excuse me?

28:49.960 --> 28:52.178
Look... check
the paramedic.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.494
The same one that brought in
Jeffrey Grant for his sprain

28:54.530 --> 28:55.827
brought in Littlejohn

28:55.860 --> 28:57.418
later that night.

28:57.460 --> 28:58.927
Thank you.

28:58.970 --> 29:00.267
So the_ first time
you discovered

29:00.300 --> 29:01.528
there were 30,000 votes

29:01.570 --> 29:03.390
in that ballot box
for your husband

29:03.440 --> 29:05.465
was in court, on the
eve of the election.

29:05.510 --> 29:06.465
No.

29:08.010 --> 29:09.307
Then when did you
first discover it?

29:09.340 --> 29:10.534
I never discovered it.

29:10.580 --> 29:13.299
There was never 30,000 votes
for my husband.

29:13.350 --> 29:14.339
Oh, I see.

29:14.380 --> 29:18.282
Then when did you first
discover there were...

29:18.320 --> 29:20.311
28,158 votes
for your husband?

29:20.350 --> 29:22.409
When you showed me
the video.

29:22.460 --> 29:24.849
And when did you first see
this video?

29:30.500 --> 29:31.967
What is this video?

29:32.000 --> 29:33.422
Another surveillance video.

29:33.470 --> 29:34.937
This one's from
the 23rd Precinct,

29:34.970 --> 29:36.232
early voting.

29:36.270 --> 29:37.999
Um, I've never seen that video

29:38.040 --> 29:39.166
until this moment.

29:39.210 --> 29:40.768
And this video?

29:44.180 --> 29:45.841
CARY:
Just to clarify,

29:45.880 --> 29:47.472
this is the very first time

29:47.510 --> 29:48.408
Mrs. Florrick
has seen these videos

29:48.450 --> 29:50.839
and we have no knowledge
what they signify.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.586
They signify that Mr. Florrick
stole an election.

29:53.620 --> 29:55.588
This is not about 30,000 votes.

29:55.620 --> 29:57.212
This was a conspiracy.

29:57.260 --> 29:59.421
A conspiracy of middle men, sir.

29:59.460 --> 30:02.190
Peter had no knowledge
of thes_e_actions.
AllCla...

30:02.230 --> 30:03.254
DUBECK:
Well, that's the
question, isn't it?

30:03.300 --> 30:06.098
What did the governor know,
when did he know it?

30:06.130 --> 30:08.439
That's what makes Will Gardner's
testimony so interesting.

30:08.470 --> 30:10.495
He took this video
to the governor,

30:10.540 --> 30:12.007
and the governor
did nothing.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.372
Thank you so much.
And Alicia is needed

30:14.410 --> 30:15.479
at a correspondents' luncheon.

30:15.510 --> 30:17.899
You can bury your head
in the sand, Mrs. Florrick,

30:17.950 --> 30:21.511
but once will Gardner testifies,
the dominoes will start falling.

30:21.550 --> 30:23.108
CARY:
Alicia, this way.

30:32.660 --> 30:35.197
I talked to the paramedics.
They never changed the sheet.

30:35.230 --> 30:36.492
The DNA was transferred
on the stretcher.

30:36.530 --> 30:37.554
Will the paramedics
testify?

30:37.600 --> 30:39.067
Yeah. I just need
a few hours.

30:39.100 --> 30:40.260
Good, I'll get 'em.
Okay.

30:40.300 --> 30:41.392
Kalinda.
Yeah?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.533
That's why you can't leave.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.308
Good news, Jeffrey, great news.

30:48.340 --> 30:50.877
Oh, my God,
when did that happen?

30:50.910 --> 30:52.571
BAILIFF:
All rise!

30:52.610 --> 30:54.646
Did you have any more questions,
counselor?

30:54.680 --> 30:56.375
No, Your Honor,
I tender the witness.

30:56.420 --> 30:58.342
No, questions, Your Honor,
but I request a sidebar.

30:58.390 --> 30:59.539
Come on up.
What do I do?

30:59.590 --> 31:02.252
Let me talk to the judge.
Solitary is better than this.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.422
What is it now, counselor?

31:07.460 --> 31:09.553
Your Honor, we have a
new piece of evidence

31:09.600 --> 31:11.465
that would require a
short overnight recess.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.559
A new piece? Really?

31:13.600 --> 31:14.931
My gosh.

31:14.970 --> 31:16.392
Dramatics,
Your Honor.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.305
What is this new piece?

31:18.340 --> 31:20.638
We believe the DNA was
transferred through
a paramedics gurney.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.638
Come on.
Seriously?
There is precedent
for this.

31:22.680 --> 31:24.671
An Oakland man
was conVIcted

31:24.710 --> 31:26.507
of first-degree murder
and spent two years

31:26.550 --> 31:28.973
in prison before it was
overturned.
Precedent?

31:29.020 --> 31:31.614
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

31:31.650 --> 31:33.641
("Mission District"
by The Black Angels playing)

31:42.560 --> 31:44.562
*

31:56.640 --> 31:58.642
*

32:05.520 --> 32:07.249
(Polmar laughs)

32:07.290 --> 32:09.679
(Will speaks indistinctly)

32:17.760 --> 32:21.662
* You only love yourself...

32:21.700 --> 32:23.691
*

32:26.140 --> 32:28.108
(gavel bangs loudly,
music stops)

32:28.140 --> 32:31.507
DIANE:
Your Honor, at the very most,
this is a DUI. That's all.

32:31.550 --> 32:34.417
My client is a respected
businessman.

32:34.450 --> 32:36.179
He's shown a clear sense of...

32:36.220 --> 32:38.188
(distant gunshot)

32:38.220 --> 32:41.087
(people clamoring
in distance)

32:41.120 --> 32:42.712
(gunshot)

32:42.760 --> 32:44.978
(gunshot, woman screams)

32:45.030 --> 32:47.021
(people clamoring)

32:50.460 --> 32:52.519
Shots fired at Cook County
courthouse.

32:52.570 --> 32:54.458
(gunshot)
Everyone stay put.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.138
(clamoring, screaming
in distance)

32:58.310 --> 33:00.528
(indistinct radio transmission)

33:08.580 --> 33:10.275
What is this?

33:10.320 --> 33:12.049
(clattering, woman screams)
What's going on?

33:12.090 --> 33:14.081
I don't know.
Will's court.
I know.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.348
Look, stay here.

33:15.390 --> 33:17.608
(panicked shouting)

33:19.690 --> 33:21.055
MAN:
Stay down!

33:21.100 --> 33:24.365
(gunshots, woman screams)

33:24.400 --> 33:26.197
(alarm beeping)

33:26.230 --> 33:28.630
Orders to lock this down.
How many?

33:28.670 --> 33:31.104
I don't know.
I only saw one,
but there might others.

33:31.140 --> 33:32.664
Did the lavwers get out?

33:32.710 --> 33:33.859
Where are they?
I think one ran

33:33.910 --> 33:36.435
behind the judge's bench,
but there could be two others.

33:36.480 --> 33:37.674
Will!
Damn it, Kalinda,
back off!

33:37.710 --> 33:39.075
My boss is in there.

33:39.110 --> 33:41.317
Don't shoot! _
Hey, hands in the air!

33:41.350 --> 33:42.612
Down! Get down!
Don't shoot!

33:42.650 --> 33:46.245
POLMAR:
I've got someone in here!
I need help!

33:46.290 --> 33:48.178
Over here!
SHERIFF: We're coming for you!
Just hang tight!

33:48.220 --> 33:49.255
No, no, we don't know
where they are.

33:49.290 --> 33:51.087
MAN: She said she saw him
heading behind the bench.

33:51.130 --> 33:52.381
I have SWAT on its way.
We wait here.

33:52.430 --> 33:54.455
How many shots
were fired?
Tactically, we
don't know how many.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.388
It could have been anybody.
Negaﬁve,havenT
seen him yet...

33:56.430 --> 33:57.829
Have them get back to me.

33:57.860 --> 34:00.067
POLMAR:
We got blood loss!
I can't wait!

34:00.100 --> 34:02.739
Operations, seal the exit.
We need a bus forthwith.

34:02.770 --> 34:04.829
KaHnda!
Damn it! Get back here!

34:04.870 --> 34:06.633
Kalinda, get down! There
could be more than one.

34:06.670 --> 34:09.070
(indistinct radio transmission)

34:09.110 --> 34:12.147
(alarm beeping, gun dry firing)

34:24.730 --> 34:27.449
(alarm continues)

34:35.570 --> 34:36.798
He needs help.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.262
Will!

34:40.370 --> 34:42.406
Paramedics!

34:43.340 --> 34:45.308
(ambulance horn blares)

34:45.350 --> 34:47.306
(indistinct radio transmission)

34:47.350 --> 34:49.841
Excuse me, could you...

34:49.880 --> 34:53.509
Hi. Where is he?

34:53.550 --> 34:56.189
They-they took him in there
a few minutes ago.

34:56.220 --> 34:57.778
Is he all right?
I don't know.

34:57.820 --> 35:00.129
I'm sorry.

35:00.930 --> 35:02.625
Sorry.

35:06.830 --> 35:08.661
Excuse me. Um...

35:08.700 --> 35:10.736
Have you seen
Will Gardner?

35:10.770 --> 35:12.465
He was one of the people shot
in the courthouse.

35:12.510 --> 35:14.535
I'm sorry.
Those aren't my patients.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.832
Do you know
where he is?

35:16.880 --> 35:19.906
No. I can find out for you.
Just wait here.

35:25.750 --> 35:28.514

You're gonna be all right,
buddy.

35:29.590 --> 35:30.750
His family,
his sisters,

35:30.790 --> 35:32.348
I have to call them.

35:32.390 --> 35:33.789
Um, I'll do that.

35:33.830 --> 35:35.695
Nqum

35:37.960 --> 35:39.496

35:44.970 --> 35:46.733
MAN (over speaker):
At this time,
I'd like to ask you all

35:46.770 --> 35:47.907
to please take your seats.

35:47.940 --> 35:49.271
ELI:
He had other tapes?

35:49.310 --> 35:51.642
Yes, three other
surveillance tapes.

35:51.680 --> 35:52.806
With Jim Moody?

35:52.850 --> 35:55.614
No! People I didn't recognize.

35:55.650 --> 35:59.518
(whispers):
He's coming
after you, Eli.

35:59.550 --> 36:01.359
As long as it's performed
by underlings, we're okay.

36:01.390 --> 36:02.687
(phone buzzes)

36:02.720 --> 36:04.585
Howard, Michael, have you met
Alicia Florrick?

36:04.630 --> 36:06.188
ALICIA:
Oh, nice to meet you.

36:06.230 --> 36:07.458
(phone line rings)

36:15.270 --> 36:20.765
I mean, Ijust saw him
a few hours ago. He was...

36:20.810 --> 36:22.539
He was happy.

36:22.580 --> 36:24.946
The case was working.

36:27.780 --> 36:30.772

they're both here.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.639
No.

37:07.320 --> 37:09.652
(sobs):
No.

37:12.490 --> 37:13.855
(sobs)

37:32.980 --> 37:35.813
He doesn't look
like himself.

37:36.980 --> 37:39.847
I have to get Alicia.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.827
(audience laughs)

37:45.860 --> 37:47.589

37:47.630 --> 37:49.621

Oh, this is good weed!

37:49.660 --> 37:52.891
I want more of this!
Where can I get more of this?!

37:52.930 --> 37:54.898
Right here, direct
for your correspondents.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.999
(a la Cheech Marin):
No, man, you can't get it here.
Not in Illinois.

37:57.040 --> 37:58.632
We're gonna have
to go to Colorado.

37:58.670 --> 38:02.834
(a la Richard Nixon):
But-but I got bad joints. I need
the medical marijuana now!

38:02.880 --> 38:03.835
I was gonna say something,

38:03.880 --> 38:06.701
but I just, I just can't
remember what it was.

38:06.750 --> 38:08.911
(a la Bill Clinton):
You know, I mean, I don't know
why everybody's fighting.

38:08.950 --> 38:11.384
(phone buzzing)
You need to calm down.
You're all right.

38:11.420 --> 38:12.910
It's the only thing
that takes the pain away.

38:12.950 --> 38:14.508
(a la Schwarzenegger):
You need to call the governor.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.778
Get on the phone!
Tell him to pass a law!

38:16.820 --> 38:20.085

Or his, a-a-a, da-da-da, wife.

38:20.130 --> 38:21.597
(normal voice):
Alicia Florrick,

38:21.630 --> 38:22.824
she's a good sport.
(audience laughs)

38:22.860 --> 38:24.964
(phone buzzing)
Imagine if the governor
got a little high

38:25.000 --> 38:26.627
and had to talk to his wife.

38:26.670 --> 38:29.969
He'd be like,
"Honey, I'm stoned."

38:30.000 --> 38:31.035
KaHnda?

38:31.070 --> 38:32.935
I got him.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.007
Uh, Eli...

38:37.040 --> 38:39.645
uh, I-I need to talk to Alicia.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.910
She's on the dais. She can't
come now. What's wrong?

38:41.950 --> 38:44.510
I-I need to talk to her, Eli.
Kalinda,

38:44.550 --> 38:46.916
she's in the middle
of the correspondents' luncheon.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.918
Eli, Will's dead.

38:48.960 --> 38:52.088
(continues indistinctly)

38:52.130 --> 38:54.086
There was a shooting
in the courthouse,

38:54.130 --> 38:56.894
and he got caught up
in the crossfire.

38:56.930 --> 38:58.397
I need to speak to Alicia.

38:58.430 --> 38:59.988
(audience laughing)

39:00.030 --> 39:03.363
Yes. Just a second.

39:03.400 --> 39:06.039
You want brownies? You'_re
definitely getting a brownie.

39:06.070 --> 39:08.106
(a la Schwarzenegger):
It's gonna, it's gonna be
like a brownie.

39:08.140 --> 39:09.869
You're going to eat it.
It's gonna be good, ja.

39:09.910 --> 39:12.640
You know, you're going
to chomp on it, ja,

39:12.680 --> 39:14.944
and then you get all crazy
in the head.

39:14.980 --> 39:18.484
(continues indistinctly)

39:18.520 --> 39:20.010
There's a call for you.

39:20.050 --> 39:20.880
Now?

39:20.920 --> 39:23.388
Yes.

39:23.420 --> 39:25.627
You have to take it.

39:26.660 --> 39:28.423
Eli, what is it?

39:28.460 --> 39:29.927
When you start talking
about medical marijuana...

39:29.960 --> 39:31.962
(continues indistinctly)

39:33.670 --> 39:35.638
(audience laughing)

39:35.670 --> 39:37.661
(continues indistinctly)

39:43.010 --> 39:45.001
(comedian continues
indistinctly, audience laughs)

39:47.480 --> 39:49.118
Hello?
