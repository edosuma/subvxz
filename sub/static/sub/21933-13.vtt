WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:02.970
Hey, I need
some advice.

00:03.003 --> 00:04.472
I want to go to
the Ed Sheeran concert

00:04.505 --> 00:06.074
Saturday with
my friends, so...

00:06.107 --> 00:08.776
how do I get Dad
to say yes?

00:08.809 --> 00:10.378
Okay, first of all,

00:10.411 --> 00:11.812
pronounce "Ed Sheeran concert"
like this.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.381
Are you ready?

00:13.414 --> 00:14.782
"Museum."

00:14.815 --> 00:15.749
Got it.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.618
And then he's gonna ask you
two questions --

00:17.651 --> 00:19.553
"Who are you going with?" and
"How are you getting there?"

00:19.587 --> 00:20.788
If you answer those
with confidence,

00:20.821 --> 00:23.257
you are in
the Sheeran business.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.193
You mean
museum business.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.560
Ooh, nice!

00:26.594 --> 00:28.662
Morning,
ladies.

00:28.696 --> 00:29.563
Hi.
Hey.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.232
Wow, looking sharp,
Dad.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.434
Ah, yeah, Vanessa and I
got a pitch meeting today,

00:33.467 --> 00:35.169
so you got to dress
like a winner.

00:35.203 --> 00:38.239
Also put on some cologne
so I smell like a winner.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.073
Yeah, yeah,

00:39.107 --> 00:40.608
that's a lot of winning
you got on.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.277
Yeah, the cap was loose.
She got away from me.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.179
So, Dad, what do you
think about me

00:45.213 --> 00:47.781
going to a museum
in the city Saturday night?

00:47.815 --> 00:50.184
Who are you, uh --
Who are you going with?

00:50.218 --> 00:52.686
Just some friends --
Kiera. Bunch of us.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.156
Okay.
Um, who's driving?

00:55.189 --> 00:56.324
Kiera's mom.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.325
Okay.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.059
Okay, what, uh --
what museum?

00:59.827 --> 01:02.296
Um, the Museum of...

01:02.330 --> 01:03.364
History.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.167
History?

01:06.200 --> 01:07.501
No, I-I think she means

01:07.535 --> 01:09.737
the Museum
of Natural History,

01:09.770 --> 01:11.139
right, Sara?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.207
The natural one.
Naturally.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.510
I guess it's okay.
I mean, just --

01:16.544 --> 01:18.679
Wait a second.
Hold on a second.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.216
What time does
the Museum of Natural History

01:22.250 --> 01:23.417
close on Saturday?

01:23.451 --> 01:26.120
At 5:45 p.m.

01:27.288 --> 01:29.190
You're not going anywhere
'cause you lied!

01:33.461 --> 01:36.830
I'm sorry. He had
a flip phone when
I was your age.

01:36.864 --> 01:42.170
* I am not your ordinary guy

01:42.203 --> 01:43.671
So, with our
low overhead,

01:43.704 --> 01:46.540
we're able to provide
top-notch security

01:46.574 --> 01:48.242
at a much lower cost
to you.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.611
Bottom line is,
y-y-you need Monkey Fist

01:50.644 --> 01:53.281
'cause people...
people out there are just --

01:53.314 --> 01:55.183
they're bananas.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.419
Hmm.
Bananas, monkeys...

01:58.452 --> 02:00.388
I love it.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.290
It was--
It wasn't even on the card.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.358
I just threw that out there.
That was amazing.

02:04.392 --> 02:06.627
It was good.
Well, I got a feeling
we'll see you real soon.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.229
Alright!
This is amazing.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.230
Great.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.764
Thank you.
Okay.
Can you
believe that...

02:10.798 --> 02:11.899
Alright,
alright.
Awesomeness.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.634
Celebrate outside,
outside, outside.

02:16.937 --> 02:17.838
Okay, now!

02:17.871 --> 02:19.473
Yes!
Yeah!
We crushed it.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.342
I mean, you were on fire
with the stats.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.776
I got to say --
They weren't even
boring this time.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.712
And -- And when you
went on about the --
the banana thing,

02:24.745 --> 02:25.879
I was --
first, I was cringing...
Yeah.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.216
...but then he liked it,
and I was like, "Okay!"
Okay.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.883
I was like -- I couldn't even
believe it was happening.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.719
I was literally hovering
above my body,

02:31.752 --> 02:33.254
watching myself
say it.
Right?!

02:33.287 --> 02:35.189
I was like,
"Go, go, go!" Yes!
Yes!

02:35.223 --> 02:36.290
That is amazing!
We're gonna get this job.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.958
I feel it.
I really do feel good.
I know. I know.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.760
Let's go.
Let's go.
Okay, alright,
let's get out of here.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.531
Cellucci?
Gable?
Frank Munson?

02:43.564 --> 02:45.266
You -- What,
you working SWAT now?

02:45.299 --> 02:47.268
Nah, nah,
I retired eight years ago.

02:47.301 --> 02:48.602
Started my own company --
Nassau Security.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.504
Oh.
Nassau Security?

02:50.538 --> 02:52.306
You guys are huge.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.275
We're doing alright.
Can't complain. You?

02:54.308 --> 02:55.943
Uh, yeah,
we started one, too.

02:55.976 --> 02:56.944
Monkey Fist.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.847
We're banging
some pots and pans ourselves.

02:59.880 --> 03:00.948
I don't follow.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.550
You know,
just making some noise,

03:02.583 --> 03:04.318
grabbing
some attention.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.254
I'm sure
you heard of us.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.788
No.

03:07.821 --> 03:08.856
You guys
on Long Island?

03:08.889 --> 03:10.358
Yes, we--
we're on Long Island.

03:10.391 --> 03:11.592
We were just
in there pitching.

03:11.625 --> 03:12.926
Oh,
totally crushed it.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.328
We just nailed it.
Nice!

03:14.362 --> 03:15.996
We're actually
heading in ourselves.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.432
Matter of fact, John,
go plug in the fog machine.

03:18.466 --> 03:19.867
F

03:19.900 --> 03:22.002
Yeah, we do a little, uh,
weapons demo, some MMA.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.404
You know,
the old dog and pony show.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.507
Oh, yeah, right. Well,
she was in there just
dropping some facts

03:26.540 --> 03:28.509
about all different
kinds of statistics

03:28.542 --> 03:29.377
and things like that,

03:29.410 --> 03:31.479
and I-I hit them
with a banana riff.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.682
Yeah,
it was good.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.049
By the way, Gable,

03:36.083 --> 03:38.519
I'm bummed you, uh,
shaved the moustache.
I liked that thing.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.421
Yeah. I know you do
because you used to call me

03:40.454 --> 03:41.489
Fat Burt Reynolds.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.858
Look, I'm sorry, man.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.827
I was kind of
a jerk back then.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.662
You know, we were both
trying to make sergeant.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.631
I said some things
I'm not proud of.

03:50.664 --> 03:51.732
Alright, cool.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.034
Anyway, good luck
with your pitch.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.869
May the best company win.
Thanks.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.313
They're the best company,
right?

04:05.346 --> 04:06.847
Yep.
Not even close.

04:12.553 --> 04:15.356
Congratulations!
Whoo!

04:16.957 --> 04:18.426
We didn't get it.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.727
What happened?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.295
It wasn't our day.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.363
I'll cancel
the pizzas.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.865
No. Keep 'em.
I'm a stress eater.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.400
Look, we know
you guys need hours.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.768
We'll -- We'll figure
something out.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.303
I don't want
to quote you,

04:29.337 --> 04:30.704
but you said if we
came to Monkey Fist,

04:30.738 --> 04:32.039
we'd be
"stupid with jobs".

04:32.072 --> 04:34.041
Relax.
You're halfway there.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.378
Well, as long as
we're airing grievances,

04:37.411 --> 04:38.812
my, uh,
last paycheck bounced.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.481
Okay, that wasn't
our fault.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.915
There was a technical glitch
with the, uh, payroll.

04:41.949 --> 04:42.750
Yeah.

04:42.783 --> 04:43.884
What glitch?

04:43.917 --> 04:46.420
We didn't have any money
in the account.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.422
Hello.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.490
Munson?
Munson?

04:49.523 --> 04:50.891
Hope this isn't
a bad time, guys.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.393
Yeah, well, we heard
you got the account.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.928
So, what, you come here
and want to give us a
little "victory dance"?

04:54.962 --> 04:57.398
Look, when we first
started out, we got
our butts kicked, too.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.667
Made us stronger.
And when the word
gets out on you guys,

04:59.700 --> 05:01.001
you'll be
turning down accounts.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.636
And when that happens,

05:02.670 --> 05:04.805
I want you
to celebrate.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.607
Tequila?
Little peace offering.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.476
Let you know there's
room enough for all of us.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.378
Is that a real scorpion
in there?

05:10.411 --> 05:11.679
Yep.
Covered in gold.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.782
When you guys start landing
the big gigs,

05:14.815 --> 05:17.351
crack it open,
have a drink on me.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.552
Hang tough, guys.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.522
Thanks, man.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.723
That was sweet!

05:22.756 --> 05:24.625
He took an account
from us.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.427
Ah, still,
that's a classy move.

05:26.460 --> 05:27.428
He's right.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.329
Thank you.
Not you, Hodor.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.832
Munson.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.834
I mean,
we got to up our game.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.403
You know, maybe we should get
tactical gear

05:35.436 --> 05:37.037
or something like that,
or learn MMA.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.772
You know, does anybody know
about that stuff --

05:38.806 --> 05:40.541
that mixed
martial arts?

05:40.574 --> 05:43.110
Sounds dangerous.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.912
Well, first thing
we got to do is get
our name out there

05:44.945 --> 05:47.014
'cause no one knows
we exist.
He's right.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.517
We -- We need some type
of advertising campaign.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.819
Maybe we should rent
one of those skywriting planes.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.821
Now, hear me out
on this.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.123
We just buy one.

05:56.156 --> 05:59.593
Wait a second.
We don't have any money!

05:59.627 --> 06:01.529
Okay, look, there's got to be
a way we can do this

06:01.562 --> 06:03.130
without spending
a lot of cash.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.899
Yeah, that won't be hard to
find somebody really smart

06:05.933 --> 06:07.968
who wants to work
for free.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.540
Based on
what you told me,

06:12.573 --> 06:16.109
this Nassau Security
sounds like a big player.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.479
It's gonna be difficult
to compete with them.

06:18.512 --> 06:21.815
Heyyy, information
we already have, guy!

06:24.552 --> 06:26.587
Moving forward,
what you need to do

06:26.620 --> 06:29.056
is carve out your own niche
in the marketplace.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.525
So, if they keep getting
the big fish,

06:31.559 --> 06:35.529
perhaps it's time you started
targeting the little fish.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.531
Actually, yes,
th-- that's smart.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.932
We get like
five little ones,

06:38.966 --> 06:40.601
and that's like
landing one big fish.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.035
Exactly.
Yep.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.572
I-I-I know this is off-topic,
by the way, but, uh,

06:44.605 --> 06:47.575
McDonald's has two-for-one
Filet-O-Fish every Friday.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.578
Today is Friday.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.579
Really?

06:51.612 --> 06:52.646
I told you
it was off-topic.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.447
Alright, whatever.
It doesn't matter.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.915
Just -- Small accounts.
Go ahead.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.049
Okay.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.818
Your other issue
is branding.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.520
Now, Mr. Gable,
can you tell me

06:59.553 --> 07:01.555
what is it that
you and Vanessa
are selling?

07:01.589 --> 07:02.556
Security.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.724
Okay, yes,
very good.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.960
Now, can you put security
in my hand?

07:06.994 --> 07:08.662
No, but I can put
a fish sandwich in there,

07:08.696 --> 07:09.463
and one of mine.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.599
Again, two-for-one.
It's Friday.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.735
It all comes down
to branding.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.771
So, if you guys can come up
with a slogan to that effect --

07:17.805 --> 07:19.907
uh, top of my head,

07:19.940 --> 07:22.776
"Monkey Fist: There Are No
Small Fish in Our Pond."

07:22.810 --> 07:24.645
Oh, I like that!

07:24.678 --> 07:25.679
It tells people
who we are.

07:25.713 --> 07:26.480
Yes, yes,
yes, yes.

07:26.514 --> 07:28.081
And it's
positioning yourself --

07:28.115 --> 07:31.018
Ehh, gonna stop you
right there.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.520
Monkeys don't eat fish,
alright?

07:32.553 --> 07:35.556
They live in a jungle.
Watch some TV, people.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.758
That's because
it's not about monkeys.

07:37.791 --> 07:41.061
It's about our company
landing smaller accounts.

07:41.094 --> 07:45.566
Or about our company
not knowing basic monkey facts.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.802
The point is, it's important
to brand yourself.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.705
How do we do that?

07:51.739 --> 07:53.106
I got it.
I got it.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.643
"Monkey Fist:
No Banana's Too Small."

07:55.676 --> 07:57.044
Write it down!

07:57.077 --> 07:59.547
This is crazy.
That one just flew out.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.048
Write it!
Fine, I'll write it.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.616
If it'll end this,
that's the slogan.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.885
Great, now, the other thing
we need to figure out --

08:04.918 --> 08:07.254
How do we get
that message out there?

08:10.958 --> 08:13.126
It's like the monkey punch
is coming right at me.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.261
This is amazing!

08:14.294 --> 08:15.763
Yes, we made it!

08:15.796 --> 08:18.098
We're on a bus bench
in Massapequa.

08:18.131 --> 08:20.133
You know what, that attitude
you got going on right there,

08:20.167 --> 08:21.702
it's slowing down
everything.
Alright.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.637
This is unbelievable!
You're right.
It is.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.038
It's a good moment.
Let's take
a picture!

08:25.072 --> 08:26.674
Alright, come on,
let's go.
Let's do this.
Come on. Get a shot.

08:26.707 --> 08:27.775
Come on.
Here.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.242
I can put it
on self-timer,

08:29.276 --> 08:31.078
so, if you guys want me
to jump in the shot with you.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.813
Um, you know what,
let-- let's just do it,

08:32.846 --> 08:34.147
like, a few
just with us.
Yeah.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.649
And then maybe a second,
you know what I mean?

08:35.683 --> 08:37.918
That's a no.
Okay, I get it.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.620
Uh, you know what,

08:39.653 --> 08:40.688
I'm going to have to
use a flash.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.089
It's, uh --
It's a little dark.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.257
Wait a minute. How
are people gonna see
it at night, then?

08:44.291 --> 08:46.093
It
Come on. Take it.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.929
Uh, tell you the truth,
it's pretty dark.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.866
Wow! That's it!

08:52.900 --> 08:54.201
Perfect!

09:00.941 --> 09:02.610
So, how did they know
to put the billboard
right on our spot?

09:02.643 --> 09:03.744
I-I don't know.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.746
They're just -- They're always
one step ahead of us.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.715
Yeah, man.
It's weird.
It gets worse.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.183
We got a call this morning
from Betty's Cake Supply.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.284
They fired us.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.654
They're going with
Nassau Security.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.823
Whoa, I was supposed
to work there tomorrow.

09:16.924 --> 09:19.026
Fellas.
Oh, here he is
right now.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.961
All I got to say, what,
did you come here to
steal our food, too?

09:20.994 --> 09:22.796
Look, I'm sorry about
the Betty's Cake thing.

09:22.830 --> 09:23.797
They came to us.

09:23.831 --> 09:26.099
Loved the billboard.
Whatever.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.201
But, uh, can I talk
to you for a sec?

09:32.640 --> 09:33.607
What's up?

09:33.641 --> 09:34.742
Look, cop-to-cop,
I just wanted you to know,

09:34.775 --> 09:37.945
Cellucci came by yesterday
sniffing around for a job.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.680
If one of my guys came to you,
I know you'd tell me.

09:39.713 --> 09:40.814
She'd never do that.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.916
Plus, I was with her
all day yesterday.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.885
I-I don't know.
She said she was
gonna tell you

09:44.918 --> 09:46.954
she was getting
her hair cut or something.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.155
She did say that.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.823
Look, I'm not gonna
hire her.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.759
I mean, if I was
poaching anybody,
it'd be you.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.895
I mean, you're the
kind of guy that we look
for at Nassau, you know?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.997
Alpha, urban warrior.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.833
Yeah, you know, I do
get urban warrior --
I get that a lot.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.170
'Course you do.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.838
Yeah, but,
you know what, I'm, uh --

10:04.872 --> 10:06.740
I'm committed
to Monkey Fist.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.842
So even if Vanessa
wants to jump, I'm...

10:08.876 --> 10:09.877
I'm not gonna do it.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.780
Well, if you ever need
a soft place to land...

10:12.813 --> 10:14.314
I don't even have
a card on me.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.684
That's okay. I can get
all your information
off the billboard.

10:16.717 --> 10:17.718
It's pretty bright.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.286
That's exactly
what Betty said.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.355
Hey!
Hey!

10:22.389 --> 10:24.324
So, a little bit
of good news.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.126
We are
one of two finalists

10:26.159 --> 10:28.061
for the Powell Industries
account.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.429
Oh!
Yes, I know!

10:29.462 --> 10:30.798
This could be
big for us.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.266
Yeah, this could be big
for... us.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.770
Yeah, that's what I said.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.438
Anyway, so, I'm gonna go
crunch some numbers

10:38.471 --> 10:39.740
for the pitch.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.212
Question.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.716
Uh, the other day,
you said you went to
get your hair cut.

10:48.749 --> 10:49.983
Yeah?
What about it?

10:51.384 --> 10:53.821
Funny thing -- It kinda
looks the same length.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.124
Because it is.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.926
I just got highlights.
That's weird.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.393
'Cause you didn't say
you went to get highlights.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.095
You said you went
to get it cut.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.898
Because I didn't want
to get into a conversation

11:04.932 --> 11:07.000
similar to the one
that we are having now.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.171
Guys, uh, appreciate
the banter about hair,

11:11.204 --> 11:13.340
but they're shutting off
my water in three days

11:13.373 --> 11:14.742
if I don't get a check.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.910
Time and a place, guy.
Time and a place.

11:20.914 --> 11:23.050
Alright, I'm just gonna
rip the tail off this donkey.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.217
I know you met
with Frank.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.086
What?
Yep, you're trying
to jump ship.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.054
I know all about it.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.922
What are you
talking about?

11:28.956 --> 11:30.323
Look,
you want to go, go,

11:30.357 --> 11:32.059
but I'll tell you right now,
you can't go to Munson

11:32.092 --> 11:34.061
'cause he
already rejected you.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.029
That's right. He's looking
for an urban warrior.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.865
He's looking for me.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.769
Wait, so you talked
to Munson about a job?

11:41.802 --> 11:43.771
Yeah, after you did.
Okay.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.072
For the last time,

11:45.105 --> 11:47.741
I went to the hair salon
to get highlights!

11:47.775 --> 11:50.010
Okay, I didn't want
to have to do this,

11:50.043 --> 11:52.079
but I can see
your roots!

11:53.246 --> 11:55.482
That's because
I didn't get color!

11:55.515 --> 11:57.217
It's highlights, stupid!

12:00.954 --> 12:03.824
And...bye-bye, cable.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.833
Thanks for giving me
a ride home.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.468
Soon as I get money,
I'll get the boot off
the wheel of my car.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.504
Hey, I wish
things were better,

12:17.537 --> 12:18.471
but they're not.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.341
You really think
Vanessa's going to leave us?

12:21.374 --> 12:22.776
I don't -- I don't know
what to think anymore.

12:22.810 --> 12:26.379
I just know this -- I
know Nassau Security
just keeps crushing us.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.849
By the way, this is
going to sound weird,

12:28.882 --> 12:31.318
but any chance I can come
to your house tonight

12:31.351 --> 12:33.987
while you're asleep
and watch Dutch TV?

12:38.258 --> 12:40.127
I did tell you
it was going to be weird.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.128
Yeah.
Yeah.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.097
Are you kidding me?

12:44.131 --> 12:45.232
What?

12:48.335 --> 12:50.103
Kevin:
Unbelievable.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.271
Animals.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.206
Who would
do this?

12:53.240 --> 12:55.508
It was Munson. Look,
he wrote "Fat Burt Reynolds."

12:55.542 --> 12:58.111
He used to call me
that when we were
back on the force.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.279
Not cool.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.580
Who's
Burt Reynolds?

13:00.613 --> 13:01.714
The actor!

13:01.748 --> 13:04.151
From "The Longest Yard"
and "Smokey and the Bandit".

13:04.184 --> 13:05.886
Oh, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.020
That guy.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.294
I'm sorry.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.429
I'm very visual.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.267
We got to -- We got to
get back at them, man.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.269
Well, good luck
with that, you know?

13:22.302 --> 13:24.137
He knows what you're doing
before you do it.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.106
I know.
I can't figure it out.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.442
Yeah, it's like he
has a fly on the
wall or something.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.577
Wait a second.
Say that again.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.046
Oh, come on.
We talked about this.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.248
When I say a phrase wrong,
just correct me.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.350
Don't make me
repeat it for amusement.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.887
"Fly on the wall."

13:39.920 --> 13:41.088
That's it!

13:43.356 --> 13:45.025
What are you doing?

13:45.058 --> 13:47.227
Kevin, drinking
is not the answer.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.332
Vanessa: Hey.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.202
Kev, I'm sorry
about earlier today.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.503
I don't want
to argue with you,

13:56.536 --> 13:59.139
so just for--
Yeah, well,
too late, okay?

13:59.172 --> 14:00.373
Monkey Fist is over.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.975
Done datta.
What?

14:16.489 --> 14:18.425
Literally...
didn't get any of that,

14:18.458 --> 14:20.093
so I don't know
what you're...

14:20.127 --> 14:21.394
Uh, hold.

14:32.105 --> 14:35.275
So, what I'm saying is,
you and I are finished.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.979
Good.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.347
Couldn't happen
soon enough.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.515
Can't stand
seeing you every day.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.153
And I can't stand
the sound

14:46.186 --> 14:47.620
of your annoying voice
every day.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.256
"Rah, rah, rah!"

14:50.223 --> 14:52.459
Yeah. Great.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.327
And -- And --
And I can't stand watching you

14:54.361 --> 14:55.963
stuff your big,
fat pumpkin head

14:55.996 --> 14:57.130
with food every day,

14:57.164 --> 14:58.298
with your dirty sweats,

14:58.331 --> 15:00.567
looking like
a homeless gym teacher.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.609
Well, we can
speak freely here.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.645
There are absolutely
no hidden listening devices.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.215
I just can't believe
that Munson planted a bug

15:15.248 --> 15:16.449
in a tequila bottle.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.086
I got to admit, though --
pretty great.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.554
Not th great
'cause I figured it out.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.324
Well, technically,
I figured it out

15:24.357 --> 15:27.127
because I said
"fly on the wall."

15:27.160 --> 15:29.062
So, that's how he knew
about the accounts,

15:29.096 --> 15:31.231
the billboards,
my hair, everything.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.966
Yeah, he was trying
to split us up,

15:33.000 --> 15:34.401
but you know what?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.668
We have faith
in one another.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.337
What are you
talking about?

15:37.370 --> 15:39.572
You threw me under the bus
the first chance you got.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.707
Yeah, that was a test.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.275
And...

15:42.309 --> 15:44.444
you passed.
Congratulations.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.713
So we're on
to Munson's game.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.049
Now we know --
Hold the phone.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.583
I got it.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.385
Have you got a plan,
Mr. Gable?

15:52.419 --> 15:54.221
I do.
I got an incredible one.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.588
Mm!

15:55.622 --> 15:58.058
Guys, this is where
you would, uh, follow me.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.459
Oh!
Yeah.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.028
Guys, here are
your scripts.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.130
Just stick to
the words, okay?

16:03.163 --> 16:04.531
Let's do this.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.304
Okay.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.340
The final meeting
of Monkey Fist Security

16:13.373 --> 16:16.076
is now
in order.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.411
It's a sad day.
So, so sad.

16:18.445 --> 16:19.746
But we gave it
our best shot.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.381
Yeah,
the Fist is dead.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.525
Well said, Kevin,
as usual.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.194
Well, I guess
we should call the guys

16:34.227 --> 16:35.428
over at Powell Industries

16:35.462 --> 16:36.329
and tell them
we're not gonna pitch.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.565
Oh, I-I-I don't think
we should do that

16:38.598 --> 16:40.600
'cause if Nassau Security
found out,

16:40.633 --> 16:42.035
they'll just jack up
the prices.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.570
I mean,
no competition...

16:43.603 --> 16:45.472
Yeah, but that's
Powell Industry's problem,

16:45.505 --> 16:46.439
not ours.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.408
Rootger, good point.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.381
You're Rootger.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.349
You don't --
You don't say "Rootger".

16:56.383 --> 16:58.418
So, why did you
write it?
Alright, just --

16:58.451 --> 17:00.420
Okay.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.722
Alright, everybody,
I guess have a good life.

17:02.755 --> 17:05.058
Yep, at least we ended
as friends, sort of.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.327
Rootger, keep in touch.
Rootger exits.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.529
Get out! Get out!

17:11.664 --> 17:13.400
We know we're not cheap,
but we're the best,

17:13.433 --> 17:14.601
and you get
what you pay for.

17:14.634 --> 17:15.702
Nice job, boys.

17:17.504 --> 17:18.405
What the hell?

17:18.438 --> 17:19.339
What are you
doing here?

17:19.372 --> 17:20.473
I heard you guys
broke up.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.444
Well, sometimes
tequila bottles lie.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.812
You found it.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.414
Yeah.
That's right.

17:27.447 --> 17:30.483
Took you a while.
Mm, not really.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.319
Couple days, though.
Kinda long.

17:32.352 --> 17:35.555
Not that long. I'm telling you
it was not that long.
Okay, okay, stop it.
Just knock it off.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.590
By the way, you still got to
go in there and pitch --

17:37.624 --> 17:38.558
prove you're better
than us.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.692
And we killed it.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.161
No problem.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.230
Hey, Goody,
set up the fog machine.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.731
We don't have
a fog machine.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.466
Okay.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.501
Why don't you say it
a little louder?

17:48.535 --> 17:49.536
You know what,
I'd say good luck,

17:49.569 --> 17:52.639
but it doesn't really
even matter at this point.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.609
Alright, you know what,
you guys?

17:56.643 --> 17:59.212
Let's...
Let's get in there

17:59.246 --> 18:01.548
and do the pitch
of our lives, okay?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.383
They are not
the better company.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.851
They are
just dressed nicer.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.519
Alright.
She's right.

18:06.553 --> 18:07.787
Alright,
let's do this!

18:07.820 --> 18:09.088
Rootger:
Yeah! Whoo!

18:09.122 --> 18:12.825
Mott: Guys, guys, I-I
just got to use the
bathroom, real quick.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.628
I told him to go
before we left the house.

18:24.771 --> 18:28.908
Kevin:
We might not have big billboards
or fancy tactical uniforms,

18:28.941 --> 18:31.311
but to be great, you don't need
any of that stuff.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.313
All you need is a retired cop.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.415
Vanessa:
Another retired cop.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.650
Mott and Goddy:
Two more retired cops.

Chale:
A British tech whiz.

Okay, I don't --
I don't like this.

I --
This is a bad idea.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.949
We got the account.
That's good.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.885
But you know what,
we never got these guys back.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.621
It's about honor.
We're doing this.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.524
Are you gonna give
Frank a moustache?
What

19:17.557 --> 19:18.925
Nah,
I'm taking out the "N"

19:18.958 --> 19:21.828
so it says
"Assau Security".

19:22.995 --> 19:24.964
Okay, why don't you
just take out the "AU"

19:24.997 --> 19:27.400
so it just says
"Ass Security"?

19:27.434 --> 19:28.801
Ohh!
That is better!

19:28.835 --> 19:30.903
You know, I know
I don't tell you enough,

19:30.937 --> 19:33.540
but I love having you
as a partner.

19:33.573 --> 19:36.909
God, that is the sweetest thing
you've ever said!

19:36.943 --> 19:39.546
I think we make
a great team.

Alright, here we go.

19:43.650 --> 19:44.851
Okay. Whoa!

19:44.884 --> 19:46.085
Careful!

19:46.118 --> 19:47.887
Oh
Is that what you're
supposed to do?

19:47.920 --> 19:48.955
Be careful?!
Okay.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.890
Okay, yeah, here we go,
here we go, here we go.

Would you stop
talking to me for a second?!

20:25.958 --> 20:28.795
Okay, stop panicking.
You're fine.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.497
I'm right here.
I got you.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.533
