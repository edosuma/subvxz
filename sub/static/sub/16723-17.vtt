00:19.866 --> 00:21.767
Good morning, Chariot.

00:21.768 --> 00:23.068
Good morning, Peggy-Sis.

00:23.069 --> 00:24.870
Do you want to run into town?

00:24.871 --> 00:26.772
No. It's too hot to trot.

00:26.773 --> 00:28.140
(all laughing)

00:28.141 --> 00:30.442
(all yell)

00:30.443 --> 00:31.443
ALL: Xandar!

00:31.444 --> 00:32.878
(laughing evilly)

00:32.879 --> 00:37.082
Equestranauts, I've cast a spell on
Horse Valley Farm that will bring

00:37.083 --> 00:39.318
a thousand years of darkness.

00:39.319 --> 00:40.552
(laughing)

00:40.586 --> 00:42.788
Oh, no.
We have to stop him.

00:42.789 --> 00:44.690
To the stable.

00:44.724 --> 00:47.225
(fast-tempo rock and roll music plays)

00:49.062 --> 00:51.430
ANNOUNCER: <i>Peggy-Sis.</i>

00:53.466 --> 00:54.900
<i>Headhorn.</i>

00:56.180 --> 00:57.436
<i>Chariot.</i>

00:59.505 --> 01:00.872
<i>And Minnie.</i>

01:00.873 --> 01:02.174
<i>Together they are:</i>

01:02.175 --> 01:04.876
EQUESTRANAUTS: <i>The Equestranauts!</i>

01:04.876 --> 01:06.078
Do I like this show?

01:06.079 --> 01:07.846
Neigh... I do not.

01:07.847 --> 01:09.948
I told you we should have
watched reruns of <i>Melrose Place.</i>

01:09.983 --> 01:11.950
So, Chariot, are you as excited about

01:11.951 --> 01:14.152
going to the Equestranaut
convention today as I am?

01:14.187 --> 01:15.620
(as Chariot): Maybe even more excited.

01:15.655 --> 01:17.889
(normal): Well, it's not
a contest, Chariot.

01:17.924 --> 01:19.358
You ready to go, honey?

01:19.359 --> 01:20.492
I was born ready.

01:20.493 --> 01:21.593
Let's giddyap, people.

01:21.594 --> 01:23.328
Wait, you guys are going, too?

01:23.363 --> 01:26.231
Uh, we're not <i>not</i> going
to a toy-pony convention.

01:26.232 --> 01:27.632
And Chariot's gonna get a new saddle.

01:27.633 --> 01:29.001
Finally.

01:29.035 --> 01:30.502
Chariot?
That's kind of a weird name

01:30.503 --> 01:32.604
for a horse, isn't it?
Why is that?

01:32.605 --> 01:35.974
It's like, "Hey, who's pulling
the chariot? It's Chariot."

01:35.975 --> 01:37.976
Oh, my God.
Why am I analyzing this show?

01:37.977 --> 01:39.611
Anyway, you guys can't all go.

01:39.612 --> 01:40.979
Who's gonna help me
with the restaurant?

01:40.980 --> 01:43.448
Not me. I traded shifts with Antonio.

01:43.449 --> 01:44.816
Never mind.
Never mind. Just go.

01:44.817 --> 01:46.084
ALL: Yay!

01:46.119 --> 01:49.154
Guess I'll be here with Antonio,
the employee Gene made up.

01:49.155 --> 01:52.090
You should know, he thinks you
killed his father, so he may...

01:52.091 --> 01:53.425
seek revenge.
Good luck.

01:54.961 --> 01:56.361
Hey, Bob.
You going to EquestraCon?

01:56.362 --> 01:58.630
Uh, no, Teddy. Because
that's a convention

01:58.631 --> 02:00.599
for little girls that like toy horses.

02:00.633 --> 02:02.067
Uh, beg to differ, Bob.

02:02.068 --> 02:03.502
It's for guys that like toy horses.

02:03.503 --> 02:04.503
They're called Equesticles.

02:04.537 --> 02:05.704
"Equesticles"?

02:05.738 --> 02:06.805
Yeah.
'Cause they got testicles.

02:06.806 --> 02:08.039
'Cause they're men.

02:08.041 --> 02:09.561
TINA: I'm really here.
I'm really here.

02:09.574 --> 02:11.131
I'm... Where am I?

02:11.144 --> 02:13.478
This isn't a community of my peers.

02:13.513 --> 02:16.948
Does anyone else think these
girls all look like men?

02:16.949 --> 02:18.617
I think they <i>are</i> men.

02:18.651 --> 02:20.519
This is a kind of man.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.654
We discovered a new kind of man.

02:22.655 --> 02:23.789
Do you think they're dangerous?

02:23.823 --> 02:26.658
(humming a tune)

02:26.659 --> 02:27.726
Mmm... no.

02:27.727 --> 02:29.227
(sighs): Oh, God. Poor Tina.

02:29.228 --> 02:30.162
I know, right?

02:30.163 --> 02:31.730
Why do men have to ruin everything?

02:31.731 --> 02:32.864
(scoffs) I don't know.

02:32.865 --> 02:33.865
But we kind of do.

02:33.866 --> 02:35.167
What's with us?
Aah...!

02:35.168 --> 02:36.101
All the war.

02:36.102 --> 02:38.003
All of the war.
And this, too.

02:38.004 --> 02:39.671
It is a good show, though.
It is?

02:39.672 --> 02:40.872
Yeah.
It's pretty good.

02:40.873 --> 02:42.841
Well, some episodes before the reboot.

02:42.875 --> 02:45.444
So, I guess we should
jump on in there.

02:45.445 --> 02:46.611
Oh, no.

02:46.612 --> 02:50.082
I said I wanted to "see" it,
not, like, walk around in it.

02:50.083 --> 02:51.850
On my legs.
Yeah, Tina.

02:51.851 --> 02:53.018
What do we look like to you?

02:53.019 --> 02:54.853
People that walk on their legs?

02:54.854 --> 02:56.721
Well, I'm gonna go
check out the food court.

02:56.722 --> 02:57.923
Oh, yeah.
Let's watch them eat.

02:57.924 --> 02:59.624
And watch <i>me</i> eat.

02:59.625 --> 03:01.560
You guys should see what I can
do with nachos these days.

03:01.561 --> 03:02.561
LOUISE: What?

03:02.562 --> 03:03.895
GENE: You'll see...

03:03.896 --> 03:06.098
Okay. I guess I'll just take a lap.

03:06.099 --> 03:07.365
Meet you back here in 12 hours?

03:09.368 --> 03:10.941
Ooh. I like this one.

03:10.970 --> 03:13.438
That's hand-stitched.
They're $95.

03:13.439 --> 03:14.873
$95?

03:14.874 --> 03:16.208
You could buy
an actual saddle for that.

03:16.242 --> 03:17.676
(Tina nervously laughs)

03:17.710 --> 03:19.211
Okay. Never mind.

03:19.212 --> 03:21.379
I guess I can't get you
a new saddle, girl.

03:21.380 --> 03:22.781
Don't look at me like that.

03:22.782 --> 03:25.217
Nice Chariot doll.
Is it your dad's?

03:25.218 --> 03:26.918
(sighs) No. It's mine.

03:26.953 --> 03:28.954
Wha... What's, what's
the matter, little lady?

03:28.988 --> 03:31.323
I guess I just feel
a little out of place here.

03:31.324 --> 03:32.924
Maybe because
I don't have enough money.

03:32.925 --> 03:33.925
And I'm not a grown man.

03:33.926 --> 03:35.127
Oh. You can barely tell.

03:35.161 --> 03:36.628
Listen, why don't you
hang out with us?

03:36.629 --> 03:38.430
This is Sunpuddle.
Ta-da.

03:38.431 --> 03:39.898
Horseplay.
Pleasure.

03:39.899 --> 03:41.666
Pony Danza.
Neigh!

03:41.667 --> 03:42.834
And I'm Bronconius.

03:42.835 --> 03:44.369
Great. I'm Tina.

03:44.370 --> 03:45.604
I was starting to feel
like I didn't belong.

03:45.638 --> 03:46.805
Are you kidding?

03:46.806 --> 03:48.573
Everyone belongs here.

03:48.574 --> 03:50.442
That's what the Equestranauts
is all about.

03:50.443 --> 03:51.810
You can be anything you want to be.

03:51.811 --> 03:53.145
No judgments.

03:53.146 --> 03:54.746
Well, some judgment by me, like this.

03:54.747 --> 03:55.914
Hot mess.

03:55.915 --> 03:56.915
Hey.
Are you okay?

03:56.916 --> 03:58.350
You're a <i>cute</i> mess.

03:58.351 --> 04:00.185
I want to talk more
about that pony, Tina.

04:00.186 --> 04:01.086
When'd you get it?

04:01.087 --> 04:02.621
I came out of the womb with it.

04:02.622 --> 04:04.089
Just kidding.
I got it on my fifth birthday.

04:04.123 --> 04:06.091
(laughing)

04:06.092 --> 04:08.793
I didn't recognize it
as a joke at first.

04:08.794 --> 04:12.130
Well, my theory is the
original series and the reboot

04:12.131 --> 04:13.765
take place in the same multiverse.

04:13.766 --> 04:16.201
Yes!
That totally makes sense.

04:16.202 --> 04:18.503
Then how do you explain
the Incepticon?

04:18.504 --> 04:20.404
Come on. Were they Incepti-kidding?

04:20.439 --> 04:23.013
(all laughing hysterically)

04:24.510 --> 04:25.677
I guess they were.

04:25.678 --> 04:29.314
Say, Tina, have you ever thought about, uh...
selling that pony?

04:29.315 --> 04:31.283
Oh, no. Why, Bronconius?

04:31.317 --> 04:33.051
Oh. Just Bron-curious.

04:33.052 --> 04:35.220
So... you're the original owner?

04:35.221 --> 04:37.989
Yeah, but I hate to say I'm her owner.

04:37.990 --> 04:40.292
I prefer mother, caretaker,
best friend and role model.

04:40.326 --> 04:42.894
And she couldn't ask
for a better role model.

04:42.895 --> 04:46.064
Look at all you've accomplished
Tina, with your... bangs...

04:46.065 --> 04:48.533
and your... socks.
Thank you.

04:48.534 --> 04:49.734
Oh. Hey. Oh, my gosh.

04:49.735 --> 04:51.369
What's this?

04:51.370 --> 04:53.638
Why, it's the new
Cosmic Twinkle Chariot doll.

04:53.639 --> 04:55.874
Gee, and I don't even really need it.

04:55.875 --> 04:57.142
Want to just trade straight up?

04:57.143 --> 04:58.877
(sighs): Yeah... I-I don't know.

04:58.878 --> 05:00.145
Tina. Tina. Tina.

05:00.146 --> 05:04.316
Face it, your Chariot doll's
looking a little... giddy-yuck.

05:04.317 --> 05:06.718
Me and the guys here think
you deserve an upgrade.

05:06.719 --> 05:07.953
Right, guys?

05:07.954 --> 05:09.721
Right, guys?
Ye... yeah.

05:09.722 --> 05:10.822
Right. Yeah, I think that.

05:10.823 --> 05:11.822
Sure.
Treat yourself.

05:11.824 --> 05:14.392
See? This is (grunts) gross.

05:14.427 --> 05:15.527
But this...

05:15.528 --> 05:17.562
Oh... so pretty.

05:17.597 --> 05:18.897
It is pretty.

05:18.898 --> 05:21.399
Everyone will envy you.

05:21.434 --> 05:23.501
Um... okay.

05:23.502 --> 05:24.502
BRONCONIUS: Great!

05:24.537 --> 05:25.537
Well, got to gallop.

05:25.538 --> 05:26.938
What? Oh.

05:26.939 --> 05:27.872
BRONCONIUS: Guys, let's pick it up.

05:27.873 --> 05:29.541
ALL: Bye.
B-Bye.

05:29.542 --> 05:32.510
(laughs)
The rarest Chariot doll is mine!

05:32.511 --> 05:35.180
And all I had to do was swindle
little miss Tina-bopper.

05:35.181 --> 05:37.182
She had no idea what it was worth!

05:37.183 --> 05:37.983
What the...?

05:37.984 --> 05:39.417
(Bronconius laughs evilly)

05:39.418 --> 05:41.486
Uh, great, Bronconius.
Good job.

05:41.520 --> 05:44.956
Tina, did some guy just swindle
you out of your toy horse?

05:44.957 --> 05:46.891
What? No.
I mean, kind of.

05:46.892 --> 05:48.093
Why did you say that?

05:48.094 --> 05:49.261
He just said it.

05:49.262 --> 05:50.795
Wha? Who? Wha...
What's going on? Wha?

05:50.796 --> 05:52.230
Tina got swindled!

05:52.231 --> 05:53.732
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

05:53.733 --> 05:54.966
Ah...!
I told you,

05:54.967 --> 05:56.743
we should never have
left the food court!

05:58.507 --> 06:00.007
How could I be so stupid?

06:00.008 --> 06:01.776
Bronconius played me for a fool.

06:01.810 --> 06:04.345
I can't believe someone
cheated you out of your doll.

06:04.346 --> 06:06.580
Equesticles! (growls)
Can't trust them.

06:06.581 --> 06:08.082
Why would somebody do that?

06:08.083 --> 06:09.483
What's so special about your horse?

06:09.484 --> 06:11.085
"The rarest Equestranaut."

06:11.086 --> 06:12.953
Only six in the world!

06:12.954 --> 06:14.522
My Chariot was rare?

06:14.523 --> 06:15.644
She never even mentioned it.

06:15.657 --> 06:16.924
She was so humble.

06:16.925 --> 06:19.193
It has a rare production defect.

06:19.194 --> 06:20.594
It has camel toe.

06:20.629 --> 06:21.829
It has camel toes?

06:21.863 --> 06:23.497
No. Camel toe.

06:23.532 --> 06:24.832
Oh...

06:24.833 --> 06:26.500
Well, this is ridiculous.
She's just a kid.

06:26.501 --> 06:28.836
And I bought that the night
before your fifth birthday

06:28.837 --> 06:31.605
when your mom remembered we didn't
have anything else for you.

06:31.606 --> 06:34.442
I'm going down to that convention
and I'm getting that doll back.

06:34.443 --> 06:37.044
Bronconius isn't gonna
just give it back, Dad.

06:37.045 --> 06:39.213
Wake up!
He tricked Tina!

06:39.214 --> 06:40.681
We got to fight trick with trick!

06:40.715 --> 06:42.483
Like what, Louise?

06:42.484 --> 06:44.084
Dad's gonna waltz in there
disguised as an Equesticle

06:44.085 --> 06:46.086
with a complete knowledge
of the show, earn their trust,

06:46.087 --> 06:48.289
infiltrate their inner sanctum,
then steal Chariot back?

06:48.290 --> 06:51.025
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! And yes!

06:51.059 --> 06:52.827
No, no and no.

06:52.828 --> 06:54.328
Oh, come on!

06:54.329 --> 06:56.030
We've always wanted
to give you a makeover.

06:56.031 --> 06:58.132
And I've always wanted to
make you a silly costume

06:58.133 --> 06:59.533
that you have to wear in public.

06:59.568 --> 07:01.202
And you love me
and would do anything for me.

07:01.236 --> 07:02.703
Yeah, do it for us.

07:02.704 --> 07:04.205
(groans) Okay. Fine.

07:04.206 --> 07:05.372
ALL: Yay!

07:05.373 --> 07:06.507
Undercover Horse Dad!

07:08.009 --> 07:10.978
PEGGY-SIS: I love a good picnic
after completing a mission.

07:10.979 --> 07:13.347
And I love a good picnic
after completing a picnic.

07:13.348 --> 07:14.281
PONIES: Minnie!

07:14.282 --> 07:15.643
(Minnie laughs)

07:15.650 --> 07:18.486
So, Minnie's power is, she's small?

07:18.487 --> 07:21.155
Yes, Dad! And it comes in extremely
handy in many of their missions.

07:21.156 --> 07:22.356
Focus, damn it.

07:22.357 --> 07:24.158
I'm sorry, Tina. I'm trying.

07:24.159 --> 07:25.693
Dad, you have to be perfect.

07:25.694 --> 07:27.361
These people know everything
there is to know

07:27.362 --> 07:28.929
about the Equestranaut multiverse.

07:28.930 --> 07:30.364
One slipup, and it's over.

07:30.398 --> 07:32.032
Okay. So, I'll just watch this

07:32.033 --> 07:33.667
a few more times, take notes and...
And all these.

07:33.668 --> 07:34.768
Okay.

07:34.769 --> 07:35.769
And read all of this.

07:35.770 --> 07:37.171
Uh, that's a lot.

07:37.172 --> 07:38.372
And when you brush your teeth tonight,

07:38.373 --> 07:39.507
use this Chariot toothbrush.
Seriously?

07:39.508 --> 07:40.875
We can't take any chances.

07:40.876 --> 07:42.076
Fine. I'll use it.

07:42.077 --> 07:43.377
So, the mane is the bristles.

07:43.378 --> 07:44.612
Right. Right. I got that.

07:44.613 --> 07:45.646
Well, you're doing it backwards.

07:45.647 --> 07:47.781
Oh. Oh. Right.
It has two manes.

07:47.782 --> 07:49.517
Oh. That's the tail.
No. That's... Yes.

07:49.518 --> 07:51.285
I got it.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

07:53.688 --> 07:54.922
LOUISE: Wow!

07:54.956 --> 07:56.056
Amazing.

07:56.057 --> 07:58.292
I, uh...
I have no words.

07:58.293 --> 07:59.760
Dad, pop quiz:

07:59.761 --> 08:01.061
Who did Horsana marry in season three?

08:01.096 --> 08:02.096
(groans) Prince Horson.

08:02.097 --> 08:03.764
No. It was King Horsely.

08:03.765 --> 08:05.799
Correct. And what's
the capital of Horse Valley?

08:05.834 --> 08:08.369
Well, a lot of people
would say Horseterdam,

08:08.370 --> 08:10.137
because that's
the largest municipality,

08:10.138 --> 08:12.006
but it's actually Salt Lick City.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.040
That's right.
Ha!

08:13.041 --> 08:14.542
I would have said Horse-pelier.

08:14.543 --> 08:17.545
And finally, who would win in a fight
between all four Equestranauts?

08:17.546 --> 08:18.412
Oh, my God.

08:18.413 --> 08:20.014
Um... trick question.

08:20.015 --> 08:22.082
Because the Equestranauts
have a bond of friendship

08:22.083 --> 08:23.918
greater than any force
in the universe,

08:23.919 --> 08:25.786
so they would never have a fight.
You're ready.

08:25.787 --> 08:27.988
Bobby, this whole thing
is turning me on.

08:27.989 --> 08:29.323
You're like a sexy spy.

08:29.324 --> 08:30.724
Yeah. I kind of am.

08:30.725 --> 08:32.960
Whoa. Except I'm wearing
a horse costume.

08:32.961 --> 08:33.960
Yeah.

08:35.496 --> 08:36.563
Remember, you're Bucephala.

08:36.565 --> 08:37.731
She's their favorite minor character,

08:37.765 --> 08:39.299
so you'll have
something to talk about.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.135
Your pony name is Bob-cephala.

08:41.135 --> 08:42.736
(scoffs) Why do I even need a name?

08:42.736 --> 08:43.736
Do you have a pony name?

08:43.738 --> 08:44.805
No! I'm a girl.

08:44.806 --> 08:46.140
Girls who watch the show
are just girls.

08:46.141 --> 08:47.308
But you're a man.

08:47.309 --> 08:49.076
So act like a man
and use your pony name.

08:49.077 --> 08:50.244
Wait! I think I see them!

08:50.245 --> 08:51.645
Where? Where?
Right behind you.

08:51.646 --> 08:53.781
Abort! Abort!
Take your cyanide capsule.

08:53.815 --> 08:54.815
Gene, get off the phone.

08:54.816 --> 08:56.584
Hey, nice Bucephala.

08:56.585 --> 08:59.286
Thanks. She's, uh, my
favorite minor character.

08:59.321 --> 09:00.921
Well, have a great 'con!

09:00.922 --> 09:02.802
I was just gonna walk
in this direction as well.

09:02.824 --> 09:06.493
So, yeah, I-I... oh, man,
I love the Equestranauts.

09:06.494 --> 09:07.861
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Very much.

09:07.862 --> 09:12.433
All the different ponies... interacting.
(phone ringing)

09:12.434 --> 09:14.034
(nervously laughs)
It's my phone. One moment.

09:14.035 --> 09:15.035
(whispering): What is it?

09:15.036 --> 09:16.337
Dad, you're tense.

09:16.338 --> 09:17.538
I can tell from here you're tense.

09:17.539 --> 09:18.606
Just relax.

09:18.607 --> 09:20.441
Do it! Do it!
Relax. Do it!

09:20.475 --> 09:21.675
And, Dad, you walk funny.

09:21.676 --> 09:23.344
(whispering): Not helping, Gene.

09:23.345 --> 09:25.112
I'm just saying, work on that.
Okay.

09:25.113 --> 09:27.014
(sighs) Anyway, have you guys ever

09:27.015 --> 09:28.716
heard of this rare
Chariot doll that...

09:28.717 --> 09:29.984
Look! There's Bronconius.

09:29.985 --> 09:30.985
(phone ringing) What now?

09:30.986 --> 09:32.219
Dad, that's him.

09:32.220 --> 09:33.387
That's the guy that took my pony.

09:33.388 --> 09:34.655
Do not let him see you walk.

09:34.689 --> 09:35.856
Hi, Bronconius.

09:35.857 --> 09:37.658
Have you been having a
super great time today?

09:37.659 --> 09:38.658
Up-bup-bup-bup-bup.

09:38.660 --> 09:39.727
Who's this fella?

09:39.728 --> 09:41.095
This... Bucephela.

09:41.129 --> 09:44.231
Uh, it's actually Bob-cephela,
but you can call me Bob.

09:44.232 --> 09:45.332
It's a shortened form of the name.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.867
Nice costume.
Oh. Thank you.

09:46.868 --> 09:49.003
No. I was being sarcastic.
It's ridiculous.

09:49.004 --> 09:50.471
Uh... what's wrong with it?

09:50.472 --> 09:52.139
Actually, it's like 50% the costume

09:52.140 --> 09:53.741
and 50% the way your body looks in it.

09:53.775 --> 09:56.477
Well, season five, episode 12 called,

09:56.478 --> 09:59.346
and it wants your costume back...
after you wash it.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.248
(others gasping)
Got a little bite in you, huh?

10:01.249 --> 10:02.349
Little kicky?
Um...

10:02.350 --> 10:03.584
I like it.
Oh.

10:03.585 --> 10:04.652
Question:

10:04.653 --> 10:06.854
What's wrong with our faces?

10:06.855 --> 10:09.423
OTHERS: They're not painted.

10:09.424 --> 10:11.058
Face painting booth!

10:11.059 --> 10:13.193
Bob-cephela?
Yeah! Def... uh, yeah.

10:13.194 --> 10:14.695
Count-count me in...
to that.

10:26.542 --> 10:29.343
Look at Bob.
He's so happy.

10:29.344 --> 10:30.477
What a playdate.

10:30.478 --> 10:33.280
He's so deep undercover,
he's forgotten who he is.

10:33.281 --> 10:34.615
Oh, my God!

10:34.616 --> 10:37.851
What if he becomes a double agent
and starts spying on us for them?

10:37.852 --> 10:39.420
What a day. Phew!

10:39.421 --> 10:40.854
After all that fun, it would be great

10:40.855 --> 10:42.589
just to sit down and chat about, like,

10:42.590 --> 10:44.124
what rare collectibles we've
gotten recently, right?

10:44.125 --> 10:46.060
You go first.

10:46.061 --> 10:47.928
Well, I'd love to, but I got
to go primp for the party.

10:47.929 --> 10:49.263
You going to the party?

10:49.297 --> 10:50.597
The party?

10:50.598 --> 10:51.865
Uh, yeah... uh, yeah, sure.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.367
You primp? You groom?

10:53.368 --> 10:54.768
Yeah, I-I primp and groom.

10:54.769 --> 10:57.738
Good. So we'll all go primp and groom
and meet back up at the party.

10:57.739 --> 10:59.206
So we'll talk...
at the party?

10:59.207 --> 11:00.541
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Got to go, got to primp!

11:00.542 --> 11:02.076
See you there, Bob-cephela!

11:02.110 --> 11:04.945
Tina, clear some space
on your bookshelf.

11:04.946 --> 11:06.714
Chariot is coming home.

11:06.748 --> 11:09.016
I don't keep Chariot on my bookshelf.

11:09.050 --> 11:10.284
It's a saying, Tina!

11:10.318 --> 11:11.919
I could clear some space
on my dresser.

11:11.953 --> 11:13.673
Forget it.
Okay, bookshelf.

11:15.478 --> 11:18.313
(dance music plays,
cheering and whooping)

11:18.348 --> 11:19.715
Hey, guys!

11:19.716 --> 11:21.183
ALL: Bob-cephala!

11:21.184 --> 11:22.985
Drink?
Sure.

11:22.986 --> 11:26.188
We were just talking about which
Equestranaut has the best power.

11:26.222 --> 11:28.590
Oh, I'm not getting
in the middle of this one.

11:28.625 --> 11:30.692
Oh, come on, Bob, you have to answer.

11:30.693 --> 11:32.461
Well, it's definitely not Headhorn.

11:32.462 --> 11:34.530
What?! What?!
Hold on!

11:34.564 --> 11:36.031
I was just kidding, Horseplay. Relax.

11:36.032 --> 11:37.332
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:37.333 --> 11:38.667
I really like Headhorn.

11:38.668 --> 11:40.769
Wow. Ugh! What is in this?

11:40.804 --> 11:45.274
It's a cocktail, designed by
and for Equestranaut lovers.

11:45.308 --> 11:46.842
It's called Horse Medicine.

11:46.843 --> 11:48.177
This will really help you
get into character, Bob.

11:48.211 --> 11:49.545
(laughter) Great.

11:49.546 --> 11:51.613
Bob-cephela!
Did you... primp?

11:51.614 --> 11:53.048
Yeah. I mean, I thought I did.

11:53.049 --> 11:54.316
But you didn't groom.

11:54.317 --> 11:55.851
I did, Bronconius!

11:55.852 --> 11:57.653
Please.
Sunpuddle. Shh.

11:57.687 --> 11:59.087
Can I refill your trough?

11:59.088 --> 12:00.689
I-I, um, I have one.
Thanks, I'll...

12:00.690 --> 12:02.558
Two, please, maestro.
I'll have another.

12:02.592 --> 12:05.027
I'm impressed with all
the studying Dad did.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.995
He has a real mind
for Equestranauts trivia.

12:06.996 --> 12:08.664
The most useful skill in the world.

12:08.698 --> 12:10.532
I know, right?

12:10.533 --> 12:12.367
(gasps)

12:12.402 --> 12:14.169
How did this get in here?
It's non-canonical!

12:14.170 --> 12:16.438
It's what?
Are you trying to say nautical?

12:16.472 --> 12:18.340
Non-canonical!
Non-canonical!

12:18.341 --> 12:20.275
She's gone crazy!
Let's put her down!

12:20.276 --> 12:22.678
Dad, call me as soon as you get this!

12:22.679 --> 12:25.013
You're in trouble!
Non-canonical! Non-canonical!

12:25.048 --> 12:27.249
So, great party.

12:27.250 --> 12:28.917
I mean, really...
good dancing.

12:28.952 --> 12:31.019
Oh, God.
Except for that guy.

12:31.020 --> 12:32.721
You're such an Equestrabully.
It's refreshing.

12:32.722 --> 12:36.358
Sometimes it gets a little too
happy in Horse Valley, you know?

12:36.359 --> 12:38.393
Sure. I feel that way,
as well, all the time.

12:38.394 --> 12:40.295
Hey, uh, can I ask you something?

12:40.296 --> 12:42.497
I know you're the expert around
here on Equestranaut stuff.

12:42.532 --> 12:45.334
Oh, well, it's just something
I've proven time and time again.

12:45.368 --> 12:48.737
Well, I heard a rumor that there's
this really rare Chariot doll

12:48.738 --> 12:50.272
with, like, major camel toe.

12:50.273 --> 12:52.274
Do you know if that's true?

12:52.308 --> 12:55.043
Oh, it's true. Course, I'd
never seen one myself until...

12:55.078 --> 12:56.545
PONY DANZA: Bronconius!

12:56.579 --> 12:57.779
Come dance with us!

12:57.814 --> 13:00.716
Mmm, Bob, come, let's
show them how it's done!

13:00.717 --> 13:03.719
(whinnies)

13:03.720 --> 13:06.088
(others whinnying)

13:06.122 --> 13:07.890
Mom, Dad's in danger!

13:07.924 --> 13:09.725
Oh, what are you talking about?

13:09.726 --> 13:11.760
He's surrounded by men
who play with toy ponies.

13:11.761 --> 13:13.762
He's in the least amount
of danger possible.

13:13.763 --> 13:15.631
No! When I gave him
all the stuff to study,

13:15.632 --> 13:17.766
I accidentally put in some
of my Equestranaut fan fiction!

13:17.767 --> 13:19.301
That means he thinks certain
zombie-horse-related things

13:19.302 --> 13:20.435
happened that didn't.

13:20.436 --> 13:23.138
And if he says the wrong thing,
they'll know he's not an Equesticle!

13:23.139 --> 13:24.239
We have to go find him!

13:24.274 --> 13:27.509
Tina, I love you, but please
don't make me go back there.

13:27.510 --> 13:29.578
It smells bad.
We have to go!

13:29.579 --> 13:31.853
(dance music playing)

13:33.650 --> 13:36.852
BOB: Oh, man, this is powerful stuff.

13:36.853 --> 13:39.277
Whew! This is great!

13:39.289 --> 13:42.357
Almost as great as when the
Equestranauts had a dance party

13:42.358 --> 13:44.826
and met that girl from Earth
with dark hair and glasses

13:44.827 --> 13:46.261
that had three boyfriends.

13:46.262 --> 13:48.130
What?
Nothing.

13:48.131 --> 13:49.998
Uh, I feel good!

13:49.999 --> 13:51.366
Where are we going?

13:51.367 --> 13:55.168
(whooping and cheering)

13:55.171 --> 13:57.439
(laughter)

13:57.440 --> 13:59.541
Gentlemen, the after-party.

13:59.542 --> 14:01.810
(man singing)

14:01.811 --> 14:04.680
BOB: This looks scary.

14:04.681 --> 14:06.682
I mean, fun.
I like it.

14:06.716 --> 14:08.650
Sunpuddle, no, no, no, no.

14:08.651 --> 14:10.519
That's Bob's seat.
Are you named Bob?

14:10.520 --> 14:11.887
Oh. I was just...

14:11.888 --> 14:13.255
Bob, come.

14:13.256 --> 14:14.589
Sorry, Sunpuddle.

14:14.590 --> 14:16.291
Oh, he's always doing that to me.

14:16.292 --> 14:17.592
All these... Equesticles.

14:17.593 --> 14:19.861
We both know they're weak, pathetic.

14:19.896 --> 14:21.296
I-I don't think that.
Yes, you do.

14:21.331 --> 14:22.597
I do sometimes, yeah.

14:22.632 --> 14:23.799
We're tougher than them.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.500
We don't fear death.
What?

14:25.501 --> 14:27.135
That's why we're best friends, Bob.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.470
We're best friends?

14:28.504 --> 14:30.038
Are you asking?
Because I accept.

14:30.039 --> 14:33.208
And I'm going to let you in on a
little mind-blowing Equestra-miracle

14:33.209 --> 14:34.810
I've discovered.

14:34.811 --> 14:37.112
You were inquiring
about the camel-toed Chariot?

14:37.146 --> 14:38.795
Yes, uh, yeah, yeah.

14:38.815 --> 14:40.349
Follow me.
(quiet laughing)

14:40.350 --> 14:43.652
(dance music playing)

14:43.653 --> 14:45.020
Ugh! Where's Dad?

14:45.021 --> 14:46.521
He could blow his cover any second!

14:46.522 --> 14:48.423
We got to find that Bronconius guy!

14:48.424 --> 14:49.658
But how?!

14:49.659 --> 14:51.159
Who wants a ride
to Bronconius's party?

14:51.160 --> 14:52.728
Oh. Good.

14:52.762 --> 14:54.162
Mom? Mom?

14:54.163 --> 14:55.597
We're following him.

14:55.598 --> 14:57.032
But I want to dance.

14:57.033 --> 14:58.567
(grunting) Go, girl!

14:58.568 --> 14:59.935
Mom!
Ooh, ah. Fine.

14:59.936 --> 15:02.204
You kids never take me dancing!

15:02.238 --> 15:05.040
I want to show you
something extraordinary.

15:05.074 --> 15:06.508
(gasps) Oh, my God, this is it.

15:06.542 --> 15:08.110
What?
Uh, nothing.

15:08.111 --> 15:10.012
Just that, um, that's
a great-looking safe.

15:10.013 --> 15:11.813
Oh. Uh, thanks?

15:11.848 --> 15:14.616
It's the hotel's, but,
Bob, feast your eyes upon...

15:14.617 --> 15:18.053
the rarest Equestranauts
ever produced.

15:18.087 --> 15:20.389
The Scottie Pippen
Special Edition Headhorn.

15:20.390 --> 15:23.058
Estonian Version Peggy-Sis,
Peggy-Stroika.

15:23.059 --> 15:24.559
This thing brought down the wall.

15:24.560 --> 15:28.397
A gold-plated Minnie
previously owned by Jon Hamm.

15:28.431 --> 15:30.165
And my greatest treasure
of them all...

15:30.199 --> 15:32.768
the ultra-rare camel-toe Chariot.

15:32.769 --> 15:34.603
Yes! Yes!

15:34.604 --> 15:37.739
Oh, God, that's a great
collection you have there.

15:37.740 --> 15:39.841
Uh, can I take a look
at the Chariot one?

15:39.842 --> 15:43.578
Oh, this is more than just
a mere collection, Bob.

15:43.579 --> 15:46.081
You see, the Equestranauts
are eternally young.

15:46.082 --> 15:48.216
They have a power.
And the rare ones...

15:48.217 --> 15:49.418
more power still.

15:49.419 --> 15:52.954
But I can harness that power
and take youth from them.

15:52.989 --> 15:54.289
Do you know how old I am, Bob?

15:54.290 --> 15:56.792
I'm 49, but I look...
39?

15:56.793 --> 15:58.093
20.
Or 20.

15:58.094 --> 15:59.661
Yes.
Yeah, or younger.

15:59.662 --> 16:02.264
Bob, my best buddy, you could join me.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.299
We could live forever.

16:04.300 --> 16:07.803
All you have to do
is merge mouths like this.

16:07.804 --> 16:09.137
(moaning)

16:09.138 --> 16:10.672
Oh. Oh, God.

16:10.673 --> 16:12.107
Oh, I'm getting younger.

16:12.108 --> 16:13.842
I can feel it.
Can you tell, Bob?

16:13.843 --> 16:15.744
Uh, yup, mm-hmm, yup.

16:15.778 --> 16:17.101
Look around the side
of the eyes. You see it?

16:17.113 --> 16:18.947
Yeah, yeah, uh, looking... good.

16:18.948 --> 16:20.415
Do you still recognize me?

16:20.450 --> 16:22.350
(moaning) Do you? Immortality!

16:22.351 --> 16:23.919
Equestranauts never die.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.788
Uh, you know, except for Zombie Horse.

16:26.823 --> 16:29.991
I beg your pardon?
Zombie Horse, the fifth Equestranaut.

16:29.992 --> 16:32.094
He died, and then became a zombie.

16:32.128 --> 16:33.862
Zombie... Horse.

16:33.863 --> 16:36.579
Why am I telling you?
You've seen every episode.

16:36.599 --> 16:39.167
Indeed, I have seen every episode.

16:39.202 --> 16:41.369
Anyhoo, uh, let me plant my
lips on that Chariot, uh...

16:41.370 --> 16:43.605
Why don't we get back to the party?

16:43.606 --> 16:45.974
But I-I, you know, I want to...
I really want to kiss the doll. Later.

16:46.008 --> 16:48.910
So, you're a real Equesticle,
aren't you, Bob?

16:48.945 --> 16:51.446
Yeah, of course.
W-Why wouldn't I be?

16:51.481 --> 16:53.448
Well, then, Bob,
you'll have no problem

16:53.449 --> 16:56.718
getting the official
unofficial Equesticle "tuh-too."

16:56.719 --> 16:59.054
Uh, I... no. No. I...

16:59.055 --> 17:01.156
Not-not a problem to get a tattoo.

17:01.157 --> 17:02.691
Maybe not, but maybe...

17:02.692 --> 17:04.626
I would... think...
I would think about it.

17:04.627 --> 17:06.060
Remove your shirt.
Oh, boy.

17:10.333 --> 17:12.701
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

17:12.734 --> 17:15.002
Oh, no!
What are they doing to my Bobby?

17:15.003 --> 17:16.704
I think he was getting a back massage

17:16.705 --> 17:18.473
with a needle and men
holding him down.

17:18.473 --> 17:19.875
A tattoo!

17:19.876 --> 17:21.749
They're tramp-stamping our tramp!

17:23.617 --> 17:25.251
How's my best buddy doing?

17:25.286 --> 17:27.554
Um, very excited, but I'd sure love

17:27.555 --> 17:30.223
to check out those dolls
again real quick, and, um,

17:30.257 --> 17:31.925
I think I have to pee.
Should I pee now...?

17:31.926 --> 17:33.860
Right after this.

17:33.894 --> 17:35.962
Um... guys, maybe just
a little tattoo?

17:35.963 --> 17:37.597
How about just a little one?

17:37.631 --> 17:40.433
Oh, uh-huh. Mmm.
Like, really little, like, tiny?

17:40.467 --> 17:42.268
Little tiny little one?
Yeah, that'd be great.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.269
Mm-hmm. Sure, Bob. Sure.

17:43.304 --> 17:44.470
Do this that size.

17:44.471 --> 17:45.905
(others gasping)

17:45.906 --> 17:47.473
Bronconius, I-I don't
think we should...

17:47.474 --> 17:49.576
Quiet!
Okay, sounds good.

17:49.577 --> 17:51.010
Of course, Bob, if you've
never had a tuh-too before,

17:51.011 --> 17:53.513
sometimes a really small
tuh-too feels like

17:53.514 --> 17:54.981
you're getting a big giant tuh-too,

17:54.982 --> 17:57.250
but that's just an
illusion of the senses.

17:57.251 --> 17:59.285
Oh, God, I wish
you would call it "tattoo."

17:59.286 --> 18:01.254
What am I saying?
"Tuh-too." It's fine.

18:01.255 --> 18:02.555
Let's just get this over with.

18:02.590 --> 18:04.023
(neighing outside door, knocking)

18:04.024 --> 18:05.758
TINA: Let me in! It's Tina!

18:05.759 --> 18:07.460
The girl whose pony Bronconius stole!

18:07.494 --> 18:08.995
Don't tattoo my dad!

18:08.996 --> 18:10.630
Counterpoint...
do tattoo him!

18:10.631 --> 18:12.265
Make it say "I love Linda."

18:12.266 --> 18:13.833
Or give him some more nipples!

18:13.834 --> 18:16.135
You can never have enough! Ask a cat.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.470
I knew it!

18:17.471 --> 18:20.874
You never were a real
Equesticle, and you lied to me.

18:20.875 --> 18:22.475
My best friend!

18:22.509 --> 18:23.977
Oh, please!
It would go Sunpuddle,

18:23.978 --> 18:26.512
then Horseplay,
then Pony Danza before you.

18:26.547 --> 18:28.615
Oh, Bob, we could have had everything.

18:28.616 --> 18:31.317
We could have had the
whole world to ourselves.

18:31.318 --> 18:34.988
And you threw it all
away, and for what?

18:34.989 --> 18:36.689
Your daughter?!

18:36.690 --> 18:38.391
Um... yes.
You're crazy.

18:38.392 --> 18:41.694
Tuh-too him!
(yelling)

18:41.695 --> 18:44.430
Stop! Oh, the door was unlocked.

18:44.465 --> 18:47.567
Yeah, it's so we don't have to get
up every time someone else arrives.

18:47.568 --> 18:50.003
You, be gone!
I'm done with you.

18:50.037 --> 18:52.605
But I'm not done.
Look at what you've all become.

18:52.640 --> 18:53.840
You've betrayed the meaning
of the Equestranauts.

18:53.874 --> 18:57.176
And I don't mean the sexually-charged,
awkward, confusing vibe

18:57.211 --> 18:58.811
at this party.

18:58.812 --> 19:00.446
I like sexually-charged,
awkward, confusing things, too.

19:00.481 --> 19:01.581
Like, for instance...
Tina.

19:01.615 --> 19:05.151
Sorry. But being an Equesticle means
no judgment, right, Horseplay?

19:05.152 --> 19:07.720
I mean, you accepted me,
and I don't even have testicles.

19:07.721 --> 19:11.057
Bronconius hijacked this thing
you all love and tainted it.

19:11.058 --> 19:12.592
He's the real Xandar.

19:12.593 --> 19:14.360
I know who that is.
He's the bad guy.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.562
Hush! Get her out of here!
Like, now!

19:16.597 --> 19:19.332
The Eqranauts would never
turn against a fellow pony.

19:19.333 --> 19:20.967
The Equestranauts have
a bond of friendship greater

19:21.001 --> 19:23.336
than any force in the universe,
and you know that!

19:23.370 --> 19:25.271
She's right.

19:25.272 --> 19:27.373
(groaning) Here, get up.

19:27.374 --> 19:28.942
What?!
I'll tuh-too him myself!

19:28.943 --> 19:30.209
Mm-mm!
Mm-mm!

19:30.210 --> 19:31.878
You were never nice to us!

19:31.879 --> 19:33.746
You never even took the time
to get to know us,

19:33.747 --> 19:35.248
and we're all really terrific!

19:35.282 --> 19:37.050
(grunting)

19:37.051 --> 19:39.118
Oh, phew.
Put a shirt on!

19:39.119 --> 19:40.420
Wait!

19:40.454 --> 19:42.121
Dad did get a tattoo!
I did?

19:42.122 --> 19:43.389
What-what does it look like?

19:43.390 --> 19:44.600
Is it... is it cool?

19:44.625 --> 19:46.259
LOUISE: It's... not cool.

19:46.293 --> 19:48.328
No, it's cool...
sort of.

19:48.362 --> 19:50.063
Someday you will all die,

19:50.064 --> 19:52.441
and I will still have
the body of a 20-year-old!

19:52.466 --> 19:54.200
All right, great,
let's open that safe.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.102
Ha! You'll never get into that safe!

19:56.103 --> 19:58.237
The combination is based on
an Equestranauts reference

19:58.238 --> 20:00.006
so obscure that only the smartest,

20:00.007 --> 20:02.542
most knowledgeable Equesticle in
the world could figure it out!

20:02.543 --> 20:04.210
That Equesticle is me.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.445
Front desk?

20:05.446 --> 20:06.813
There you go.

20:06.814 --> 20:09.382
Oh, well, that was actually easy.

20:09.383 --> 20:10.984
Thank you.
Chariot, I missed you.

20:10.985 --> 20:12.919
So, good party?
So fun.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.487
Okay, well, bye, everyone.

20:14.488 --> 20:15.888
Sunpuddle, I'll call you.

20:15.889 --> 20:17.299
You better.

20:18.325 --> 20:21.094
Hey Tina, you must be
enjoying having Chariot ba...

20:21.128 --> 20:22.362
Hey. What's going on?

20:22.396 --> 20:23.696
I'm packing up Chariot.

20:23.731 --> 20:24.964
What? Why?
Oh, I'm just getting

20:24.965 --> 20:27.476
a little old to play
with dolls, you know?

20:27.501 --> 20:29.335
But thanks for getting her back.

20:29.336 --> 20:30.536
Hurray.

20:30.537 --> 20:31.938
Tina...
What?

20:31.939 --> 20:32.938
Play with the doll.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.407
But I'm too old to...

20:34.408 --> 20:35.675
Tina, play with the doll!

20:35.676 --> 20:36.709
Play with the doll, Tina!

20:36.710 --> 20:37.643
Come on, do what Daddy says.

20:37.644 --> 20:38.611
Mmm...
Play with it!

20:38.612 --> 20:39.812
Okay! I'll...
Neigh!

20:39.813 --> 20:41.647
Make it jump!
Uh, well, the...

20:41.648 --> 20:43.282
she doesn't actually jump.
I know it doesn't jump!

20:43.283 --> 20:44.851
You know how I know that?

20:44.852 --> 20:46.452
'Cause...
'Cause I read 1,200 pages

20:46.453 --> 20:47.954
of Equestranaut crap!
Mmm...

20:47.955 --> 20:49.455
Keep playing with it!
Okay. (weakly neighs)

20:49.456 --> 20:52.083
Good night.
Good night.
