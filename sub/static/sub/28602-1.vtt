00:17.651 --> 00:19.051
Two minutes.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.286
We ready?

00:21.288 --> 00:22.721
Another minute,
Mr. McQueen.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.524
Can you talk a little about
your time in Arizona?

00:25.526 --> 00:26.625
We're rolling?

00:26.627 --> 00:28.127
Sorry, Mr. McQueen.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.261
Oh, come on, guys.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.764
Sorry, we're rolling.

00:31.766 --> 00:34.299
Just talk a little about
choosing Prescott.

00:34.301 --> 00:36.068
Oh, Arizona's great.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.669
Nice people. Real nice.

00:37.671 --> 00:38.771
Genuine, you know?

00:39.774 --> 00:41.206
Very hospitable.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.343
Frontier days is a real gas.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.612
When approaching this story,
it was important that we...

00:47.515 --> 00:48.747
we focus on the realism.

00:48.749 --> 00:51.650
Realism, very important.

00:51.652 --> 00:54.219
Having recently
come off a difficult shoot,

00:54.221 --> 00:56.188
it must be nice
to now be closer to home,

00:56.190 --> 00:58.223
to family.

00:58.225 --> 01:01.193
Yeah, well,
France was a challenge.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.295
We always knew it would be.

01:03.297 --> 01:04.495
I think it's safe to say

01:04.498 --> 01:06.165
that at this point
in your career,

01:06.166 --> 01:07.833
your fans know you have
a true passion for racing,

01:07.835 --> 01:09.134
for what you drive.

01:09.136 --> 01:10.536
Talk a little about
what drives you.

01:12.106 --> 01:13.372
Come again?

01:13.374 --> 01:14.740
What would you say drives you?

02:09.896 --> 02:12.431
Damn, Freddie.

02:12.433 --> 02:15.367
Seeing you out here is like
seeing a fish ride a bicycle.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.336
What are you doing here?

02:17.338 --> 02:19.338
We got real issues, Steve.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.873
How'd you find me?

02:20.875 --> 02:22.708
How is that
even important right now?

02:22.710 --> 02:24.493
Important to me.

02:24.494 --> 02:26.277
Who cares? I'm here,
and we got issues.

02:27.681 --> 02:28.747
Stop leaning.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.315
-Leaning?
-On the car.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.817
-You're leaning on the car.
-Oh, Christ, Steve.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.620
Listen to me,
we need to talk about France.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.455
-What about it?
- Word's out.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.824
Talk's all over town,
and it's not good.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.426
Not my problem anymore.
I'm done.

02:41.428 --> 02:44.329
Yeah, maybe when your name
is Joe Schmoe from Buttonwillow,

02:44.331 --> 02:46.832
not when your name
is Steve fucking McQueen.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.401
Cinema Center reps
are not happy, Steve.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.203
So what's the brass tax?

02:51.205 --> 02:52.538
They want you to do press.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.173
-No.
-Steve...

02:54.175 --> 02:56.909
Look, the point was to make
a good film. A real film.

02:56.911 --> 03:00.379
People like a story, Steve.
They like characters.

03:00.381 --> 03:02.414
You were shooting
a two-hour documentary

03:02.416 --> 03:05.417
about a car race that
nobody in America cares about!

03:05.419 --> 03:07.586
We'd made them care.
The suits thought different.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.521
I'm done with it.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.857
Fine. I'll go back
to Rosen with that.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.525
But it's not gonna
go down too well.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.761
And it still doesn't change
where we are now.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.663
We have to do
some damage control.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.198
Damage control?

03:19.200 --> 03:21.667
- Bill called me.
-Ah, son of a bitch.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.302
We're your team, Steve,
all right?

03:23.304 --> 03:25.771
If we don't communicate,
this doesn't work.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.740
We're not the enemy.
Just let us do our job.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.826
It's time to go to work.

03:30.827 --> 03:32.911
You need to chose
your next picture carefully.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.280
I'm doing
On Any Sunday with Bruce.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.683
The motorcycle thing?

03:37.685 --> 03:40.586
No, that's a vacation.
You need a paycheck.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.454
I might have some
endorsements lined up.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.323
Strictly overseas.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.992
But our top priority
has to be your next gig.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.394
Something to put you
back on top.

03:49.396 --> 03:52.431
Have you thought about
what I said about First Artists?

03:52.433 --> 03:53.799
Just join the club, huh?

03:53.801 --> 03:55.834
Yeah, it's a good deal.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.769
And Newman, what's he doing?

03:58.706 --> 04:01.373
For First Artists? Pocket money.

04:03.811 --> 04:04.910
Come on.
You're already attached.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.778
You're the pick
of the litter already.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.948
Junior Bonner, The Getaway,
that French prison thing.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.016
Just pick.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.286
Ah, just pick, huh?

04:14.288 --> 04:15.354
Yeah.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.593
Just pick.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.262
Yeah, Steve, pick!
For Christ's...

04:23.264 --> 04:25.030
I came all the way out
to bumblefuck here

04:25.032 --> 04:26.832
to tell you things are bad.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.400
You hemorrhage your money,
and you burn

04:28.402 --> 04:30.369
every goddamn bridge
back in France.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.538
You know what's really
chapping my hide, Freddie?

04:35.676 --> 04:37.576
This car.

04:37.577 --> 04:39.477
Who cares? They come
and go with you, Steve.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.879
Yeah,
Warner Brothers gave it to me.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.514
A gift.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.782
It's a beauty.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.651
Yeah. There's just one problem.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.419
What's the problem, Haig?

04:47.421 --> 04:48.654
It's not the car.

04:48.656 --> 04:49.788
It's not the car.

04:50.391 --> 04:51.723
What car?

04:51.725 --> 04:52.891
The car.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.778
Ah, Christ.

04:55.779 --> 04:57.763
Look, this is a pacifier.
It... An imposter.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.533
The car was 1968 GT 390.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.503
325 horsepower,

05:04.505 --> 05:06.705
427 foot-pounds of torque.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.440
A real power plant.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.709
Had a four-speed
manual transmission too. What...

05:10.711 --> 05:11.777
What else, Haig?

05:11.779 --> 05:13.645
Dark Highland green.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.013
Dark Highland green.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.982
Who cares?

05:17.718 --> 05:18.884
Are you blind?

05:21.221 --> 05:23.555
Listen, this is
a '67 302 Boss prototype.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.956
It's no GT 390.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.527
And it's a fucking automatic.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.732
Find me the car, Freddie.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.701
Look, we don't have time
for this, Steve.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.036
It's all set, Steve.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.805
-Thanks, buddy.

05:42.910 --> 05:46.578
That's it. You find me the car,
I'll pick my next project.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.748
Look, that's gonna
be impossible.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.882
I need it, Freddie.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.453
Blink if it's a yes.

05:54.455 --> 05:57.055
-Good. Sundown oughta do it.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.624
You're a standup guy, Freddie.
I'll call to check in.

06:02.563 --> 06:05.931
"A two-hour documentary
about a car race

06:05.933 --> 06:08.100
that nobody in America
cares about"?

06:08.102 --> 06:10.102
- Their words.

06:10.104 --> 06:11.603
You've seen Katzin's cut?

06:12.773 --> 06:14.406
Most of John's stuff is out.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.041
Too bad.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.817
Be reasonable, Steve.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.587
Freddie, I hired you
to be a barracuda.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.022
Are you a barracuda?

06:34.027 --> 06:35.827
I'm a barracuda.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.596
Right. Find the car.

06:40.701 --> 06:41.833
Adios.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.716
Hey, wait!
I took a goddamn cab here!

06:57.718 --> 07:00.986
¶ Roll down the windows ¶

07:00.988 --> 07:03.021
¶ Man, hang on tight ¶

07:04.425 --> 07:07.859
¶ Let the smoke
Fill your lungs ¶

07:07.861 --> 07:09.628
¶ And you feel right ¶

07:10.831 --> 07:14.065
¶ The rumble moves your body ¶

07:14.067 --> 07:16.134
¶ And makes you hot ¶

07:17.471 --> 07:20.205
¶ It's pedal to the metal ¶

07:20.207 --> 07:23.975
¶ And give it all we got ¶

07:23.977 --> 07:26.812
¶ No one dares to catch us ¶

07:26.814 --> 07:30.215
¶ We're laughing as they try ¶

07:30.217 --> 07:33.552
¶ Fast as hell is how we live ¶

07:33.554 --> 07:37.189
¶ It might be how we die ¶

07:37.191 --> 07:40.092
¶ Burn it up ¶

07:40.093 --> 07:42.994
¶ Oil and gasoline
Are in my blood ¶

07:43.831 --> 07:46.965
¶ Crank it up ¶

07:46.966 --> 07:50.100
¶ Keep pushing the red line
That's what I love ¶

07:56.743 --> 08:00.111
¶ I only got one promise ¶

08:00.113 --> 08:02.080
¶ That I can keep ¶

08:03.116 --> 08:06.518
¶ Driving fast is what I love ¶

08:06.520 --> 08:09.688
¶ I can barely sleep ¶

08:09.690 --> 08:12.858
¶ If you want to come with me ¶

08:12.860 --> 08:16.228
¶ You know that I'll be good ¶

08:16.230 --> 08:19.197
¶ Hold me close, hold me tight¶

08:19.199 --> 08:23.201
¶ Let's do this like we should¶

08:23.203 --> 08:26.054
¶ Burn it up ¶

08:26.055 --> 08:28.906
¶ Oil and gasoline
Is in my blood ¶

08:29.877 --> 08:33.195
¶ Burn it up ¶

08:33.196 --> 08:36.514
¶ Keep pushing the red line
That's what I love ¶

08:36.517 --> 08:37.716
¶ Burn it up ¶

08:37.717 --> 08:41.785
¶ Drop the hammer
I like it hot ¶

08:42.923 --> 08:44.590
¶ Burn it up ¶

08:44.591 --> 08:46.258
¶ What the hell
Is wrong with me? ¶

08:46.260 --> 08:50.295
¶ I just can't stop ¶

09:32.005 --> 09:33.171
How many is that?

09:34.775 --> 09:36.308
See, this is what
I'm talking about.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.842
You think I wanna come home
after ten, twelve hours

09:37.844 --> 09:38.944
and deal with this?

09:40.914 --> 09:43.131
It's a concern.

09:43.132 --> 09:45.349
It's about you thinking you can
do whatever you wanna do.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.252
How's that fair?
How's that fair to me?

09:47.254 --> 09:48.720
You knew who you married.

09:48.722 --> 09:49.888
Oh, I know.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.991
Steve, this place,

09:52.993 --> 09:55.260
it's not good for you,
it's too small.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.128
Just come home.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.697
No, I can't.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.865
I can't, baby.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.300
Not after what happened
in France,

10:02.302 --> 10:03.835
what's been happening.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.006
I gotta get over this.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.342
I wanna come home, believe me.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.210
I gotta... I gotta get my head
clear.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.781
We've both done things...

10:16.783 --> 10:19.217
No, you did things.
This is about what you did.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.321
Have the kids noticed?

10:25.659 --> 10:27.392
Chad is fine.
I don't think he sees this

10:27.394 --> 10:29.728
as much different
than you being on location.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.798
Terry?

10:33.800 --> 10:37.068
She's sharp. She knows
something's up. Old soul.

10:44.711 --> 10:47.012
-Have you seen a cut yet?
-No.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.147
Soon maybe?

10:49.149 --> 10:50.348
Sure. Maybe.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.219
Suppose that's up to Bob Rosen.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.788
Well, no matter what they do,
it's still your movie.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.907
Oh?

10:58.908 --> 11:01.025
I guarantee, whatever they do,
it will not be my movie.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.928
Those jackals got a grip
and started tearing away.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.930
Teeth biting right into it.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.999
Oh, there'll be nothing left
but a carcass.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.312
You know, I think William Morris
is gonna be a good fit for you.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.416
Yeah, Hilly thinks so.

11:24.418 --> 11:26.885
Yeah, well,
Hilly knows his business.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.987
He's always been there for me.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.755
This could be big for me, baby.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.726
So, what is CBS saying
about the spin-off?

11:36.930 --> 11:38.363
Not sure yet.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.398
The producers
really seem to like it.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.034
Well, I have no doubt.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.077
Have you been seeing the doctor?

11:53.213 --> 11:54.379
Yes.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.850
Is there enough food here?
I could have Ariel pick up

11:58.852 --> 11:59.918
-some essentials.

12:02.889 --> 12:03.872
I eat out.

12:03.873 --> 12:04.856
Just the thought of you
here by yourself.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.157
I'm a grown-ass man.

12:06.727 --> 12:07.792
I know.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.731
You got plans later?

12:13.433 --> 12:15.266
Figure we could go to Chez Jay.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.437
I'm going to have
a quiet night, I think.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.306
Quiet night, huh?

12:21.308 --> 12:24.442
Yes. Gonna head over to Ann's,
drink some wine.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.911
-Girl time.
-Girl time.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.413
What happens again at girl time?

12:29.983 --> 12:33.017
Just girl stuff.
You know, chat, gossip.

12:33.487 --> 12:34.753
Gossip.

12:35.155 --> 12:36.421
Chit-chat.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.956
No, you said "gossip."

12:38.959 --> 12:40.158
Figure of speech.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.432
Talk about me?

12:47.434 --> 12:49.200
Sometimes. That's what girls do.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.370
No, see, that's what
the doctor's for.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.372
You... you tell
the doctor something,

12:54.374 --> 12:56.040
and he doesn't tell anyone else.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.043
He's a doctor.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.412
It's called confidentiality.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.315
Ann, well.
Ann, she's just a person.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.851
She can flap her gums
all over town.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.254
She wouldn't do that.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.322
Oh, no. Not Ann.
Not dear old Ann.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.926
I wanna know
what you and Ann talk about.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.228
Hm?

13:17.230 --> 13:18.329
Don't do this.

13:18.331 --> 13:19.497
Let's play a game.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.000
Like a scene study.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.937
I'll... I'll play Ann, okay?

13:25.939 --> 13:27.338
You might have heard of me.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.240
You, you just...

13:29.242 --> 13:31.142
-...be yourself.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.578
I don't wanna play.

13:33.580 --> 13:34.979
Oh, but you will.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.514
Steve...

13:37.250 --> 13:38.516
Tell me about him.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.986
Tell me about you.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.024
Not much to tell.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.094
Certainly a man like you...

13:51.264 --> 13:52.397
A man like me?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.533
A man of your position.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.936
My position.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.406
Your stature.

14:01.408 --> 14:04.075
You're a movie star, Steve.

14:04.077 --> 14:07.946
Surely, it comes
with its own set of burdens.

14:18.124 --> 14:20.458
This process only works
if you talk to me, Steve.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.531
Should I lay on the couch
or something?

14:27.901 --> 14:29.033
If you like.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.603
Nah, I'm good.

14:31.605 --> 14:33.171
All right. Let's start
from the beginning.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.240
Where were you born?

14:35.242 --> 14:37.308
Beech Grove, Indiana.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.077
Raised in Slater, Missouri.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.180
Tell me about your parents.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.084
Dead.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.286
Who were they?

14:48.288 --> 14:50.021
William and Julian McQueen.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.124
So tell me about them.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.129
Uh, this is ridiculous.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.265
I'm not paying you to sit here
and talk about them.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.333
This is supposed to be
about Neile and me.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.152
That's it.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.970
Are you uncomfortable
talking about your parents?

15:05.972 --> 15:08.306
No, I'm just peachy.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.275
There's no other place
I'd rather be right now.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.144
What would you rather be doing?

15:17.384 --> 15:18.917
Talk to me about your acting.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.386
It can get a little candy-ass.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.155
You must enjoy it, though.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.925
I enjoy the bread.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.662
How does it feel
to be a movie star?

15:33.333 --> 15:36.234
Pressure to succeed? No privacy?

15:36.236 --> 15:37.936
Look, Doc, I agreed to come here

15:37.938 --> 15:39.437
'cause I'm trying
to save my marriage.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.674
My melon, I...
I get it. It's twisted.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.309
It's just these questions.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.077
I don't know, I don't know
what you're getting at.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.980
We're trying to
get to all of it, Steve.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.449
We start at the foundation.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.117
What does my job have
to do with it?

15:54.955 --> 15:57.021
It's not just a job, Steve.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.290
You'd have to agree with that.

16:00.961 --> 16:02.527
It's the fame.

16:02.529 --> 16:03.695
The drugs.

16:04.698 --> 16:07.265
Extramarital encounters.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.701
I mean, wouldn't you agree?

16:11.037 --> 16:12.637
It's not a normal job.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.707
You're right, Doc.
When you're right, you're right.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.976
It's not a normal job.

16:20.714 --> 16:22.246
It's a fucking gas.

16:37.697 --> 16:38.997
Well, I guess

16:38.999 --> 16:40.665
today's my lucky day.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.472
Steve McQueen.

16:48.274 --> 16:49.607
Where you headed?

16:49.609 --> 16:51.275
Steve McQueen.

16:52.445 --> 16:53.544
That's me.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.515
The girls in Weedpatch
would die.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.550
Which, actually,
would be fine by me.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.652
Weedpatch?

17:01.654 --> 17:03.388
Weedpatch, California.

17:05.157 --> 17:06.424
Bakersfield.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.726
-Yeah.
-Consider it the ass end.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.395
So you coming or going?

17:11.564 --> 17:13.263
Oh, I'm going.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.433
I'm definitely going.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.702
Weedpatch is no place
for a girl like me.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.304
A black girl?

17:21.508 --> 17:23.741
Steve McQueen,
a girl with talent.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.345
So what's your angle?

17:27.347 --> 17:28.512
No angle.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.782
I'm a dancer.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.350
And when I say dancer,
I don't mean

17:32.352 --> 17:34.085
"Sunday, come-to-meetin',
cut up a rug

17:34.087 --> 17:35.720
at a sock hop" dancer.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.089
I'm a real dancer,
Steve McQueen.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.324
I'll break your heart.

17:44.264 --> 17:47.165
So, Steve McQueen,
you coming or going?

17:47.767 --> 17:49.634
It's not important.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.836
Something brought you out
to the middle of nowhere.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.841
You talk a lot.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.509
Now you're starting to sound
like my daddy.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.515
Take your chances
in Los Angeles, huh?

18:04.517 --> 18:05.817
No.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.285
New York City.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.786
- Oh.
- Broadway, baby.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.421
I mean, that's where
the action's at.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.623
I'm afraid
I'm not going that far.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.125
Well, that's understood.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.863
Well, how far are we going?

18:20.867 --> 18:22.700
We'll see how I enjoy the ride.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.209
Then put me on with someone
at Warner Brothers who can.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.313
I need to find
a clear bill of sale

18:35.315 --> 18:38.549
between the studio and whoever
the fuck they sold the car to!

18:38.551 --> 18:39.750
Is it that hard?

18:41.554 --> 18:43.488
You know who
you're talking to, right?

18:43.490 --> 18:46.357
Okay. So, if this doesn't happen

18:46.359 --> 18:50.161
I'm gonna personally
come down there, fire everyone

18:50.163 --> 18:51.896
and have 'em burned
at the fucking stake!

19:02.775 --> 19:07.512
Now this,
this is a nice machine.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.680
You don't see too many of these
in my neck of the woods.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.450
A '67?

19:13.286 --> 19:14.619
You know your cars.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.387
I know a lot of things.

19:18.191 --> 19:19.624
You know, you're...
you're a groovy chick.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.159
You got a cool vibe.

19:22.695 --> 19:23.794
Now, do you talk like that

19:23.796 --> 19:25.530
because you wanna
talk like that?

19:25.532 --> 19:27.465
Or do you talk like that
because you think you have to?

19:29.602 --> 19:31.903
I'm beginning to see why
Weedpatch couldn't hold you.

19:32.705 --> 19:35.206
Weedpatch.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.508
Uncle took me to catch
a Greyhound in Bakersfield,

19:37.510 --> 19:39.877
broke down in Alameda.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.846
It was either the universe
telling me to walk home,

19:41.848 --> 19:43.214
or it was a challenge.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.750
I decided to say,

19:45.752 --> 19:48.319
"Fuck you" to the universe
and keep walking.

19:56.930 --> 19:59.363
Nothing does the job better
than good fuck you.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.233
You're fucking right.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.242
I bet you were quite
the world shaker

20:11.244 --> 20:12.343
back in the day.

20:12.946 --> 20:14.212
Fucking right.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.463
I like Americans.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.934
I like American women.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.703
I like American money.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.439
I like American cars.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.543
What I don't like...

21:20.847 --> 21:23.581
are arrogant Americans.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.517
I see them every day.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.172
We let them in.

21:31.173 --> 21:32.923
They act like Havana
is a circus, a playground,

21:32.925 --> 21:35.826
prancing around like peacocks.

21:35.828 --> 21:39.730
They think Cuba
is a novelty, a trifle...

21:41.034 --> 21:43.868
to be chewed up, digested,

21:45.505 --> 21:46.804
and shit out.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.509
Are you one of these, Mister...

21:51.511 --> 21:53.911
McQueen. Steve McQueen.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.516
Mr. McQueen, are you one
of these gringos?

22:01.020 --> 22:02.086
No.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.622
No.

22:06.759 --> 22:09.860
No.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.797
So then why do you think
that you can come to my country,

22:13.433 --> 22:14.899
drink my rum,

22:14.901 --> 22:16.467
smoke our dope,

22:17.370 --> 22:18.703
fuck our women,

22:21.007 --> 22:22.573
and then have los cojones

22:22.575 --> 22:24.775
to sell contraband
on my streets!

22:32.685 --> 22:33.951
Lucky Strike.

22:36.589 --> 22:40.624
¶ Light up a Lucky
It's Lucky Strike ¶

22:40.626 --> 22:43.661
¶ Light up a Lucky
It's Lucky time ¶

22:47.734 --> 22:49.700
You know, for this type
of indiscretion,

22:52.505 --> 22:53.704
it's a fine.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.574
A modest fine.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.509
One hundred American dollars.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.513
But maybe today...

23:06.819 --> 23:09.520
Maybe today, I make an example.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.592
How about we pretend
it was yesterday?

23:26.439 --> 23:27.738
Do you know who I am, yes?

23:29.409 --> 23:31.175
Yes.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.144
Do you know
how many people I have killed?

23:36.783 --> 23:38.516
Thousands, Mr. McQueen.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.151
Thousands.

23:41.888 --> 23:43.454
Have you ever killed anyone?

23:50.997 --> 23:51.763
No.

23:51.764 --> 23:52.530
It's one of the most
satisfying things

23:52.532 --> 23:53.964
a man can do for himself.

23:55.468 --> 23:57.935
You feel so free
taking that from someone.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.506
It's better than cocaine.

24:03.609 --> 24:04.708
Or fucking.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.846
To take someone's life,
well, that's...

24:12.051 --> 24:13.584
That's transcendent.

24:16.856 --> 24:19.190
So tell me, Mr. McQueen,
why should I spare you?

24:19.192 --> 24:21.492
Because I must say,

24:21.494 --> 24:23.928
I'm feeling pretty
transcendent right now.

24:34.841 --> 24:35.973
I'll tell you why.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.106
'Cause you're a smart man,
President Batista.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.044
Hm?

24:40.046 --> 24:42.146
Been the President
of Cuba twice.

24:44.684 --> 24:47.685
Helped us fight the Krauts
and the Japs in the big one.

24:49.121 --> 24:52.523
Hell, this run you just...
You just took what's yours.

24:52.525 --> 24:54.024
Damn everybody else.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.965
Now...

25:00.967 --> 25:02.266
I live in New York.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.769
I read the papers.

25:05.771 --> 25:07.271
Luciano, Lansky.

25:08.774 --> 25:11.008
They know who
the boss man is down here.

25:12.211 --> 25:13.711
That's you.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.145
Fulgencio Batista.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.182
The boss man, right?

25:19.819 --> 25:21.819
So,

25:21.821 --> 25:24.622
offing me? Well...

25:24.624 --> 25:25.789
...that gets out,

25:27.560 --> 25:28.826
that's bad business.

25:29.295 --> 25:30.828
Hm?

25:30.830 --> 25:32.747
That's a mistake.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.665
And if there's one thing
that you do not do,

25:34.667 --> 25:36.100
it's make mistakes.

25:38.604 --> 25:39.703
Am I right?

26:02.762 --> 26:03.994
So, Winters...

26:03.996 --> 26:06.564
Winters, she's standing
right here, okay.

26:06.566 --> 26:07.998
She... She's not
supposed to move.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.266
Audience is going nuts
at this point

26:09.268 --> 26:11.569
-'cause I'm over here,

26:11.571 --> 26:13.270
-my pants are down.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.306
There's not... You know, I...
My hands are full.

26:15.308 --> 26:17.575
-There's nothing I can, right?

26:25.651 --> 26:27.818
-Cheers.

26:27.820 --> 26:30.254
-To your pants being down.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.230
Did you know, um...

26:41.233 --> 26:42.833
I lived in New York?

26:42.835 --> 26:45.069
No. No, I didn't.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.605
After my first presidency.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.373
I loved that city.

26:51.611 --> 26:55.112
The lights, Broadway.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.313
The pizza.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.048
Things are simpler in America.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.619
Then why come back?

27:02.021 --> 27:03.087
Hmm.

27:08.961 --> 27:12.329
You can never underestimate
the ceaseless allure of power.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.633
Power.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.267
It's like a capricious mistress.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.270
And when she whispers,

27:21.941 --> 27:23.107
you listen.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.050
I'm afraid our time here

27:33.052 --> 27:34.752
-has come to an end.
-Oh, come on.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.920
Hey, Batista,
we're just getting started.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.725
You do have cojones, Steven.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.662
Why did you do it?

27:45.297 --> 27:46.397
Sell the cigarettes.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.167
Oh, I needed the bread.

27:50.770 --> 27:51.969
I'm broke.

27:54.306 --> 27:55.939
Ingenuity is a gift, my friend.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.976
And you're gonna need it.

27:58.978 --> 28:02.246
Selling contraband on streets
of Havana comes with a fine.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.114
A modest fine.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.916
One hundred American dollars.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.686
And you still owe it.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.457
You still owe it, Mr. McQueen.

28:19.699 --> 28:22.132
One hundred
American dollars, Mr. McQueen.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.470
Hmm.

28:26.472 --> 28:29.006
Really? Then how'd you get out?

28:30.710 --> 28:32.309
Took the ferry back to Key West.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.845
Out of jail, sugar.
How'd you get out of jail?

28:35.281 --> 28:36.780
Sold my helmet.

28:36.782 --> 28:38.415
Your what now?

28:38.417 --> 28:40.017
My motorcycle helmet.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.087
If that don't beat all.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.223
What?

28:46.225 --> 28:49.293
I guess God smiles on you,
Steve McQueen.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.096
-Hang on.

28:52.098 --> 28:53.230
Damn it!

29:17.156 --> 29:18.322
Put that in the glove box.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.757
I surrender.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.059
-Funny.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.465
Whoop.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.372
-Ah!
-Hey.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.141
-What?
-It's a loaded gun.

29:37.143 --> 29:38.208
You'll shoot yourself
on the foot,

29:38.210 --> 29:39.777
or worse yet, shoot me.

29:39.779 --> 29:41.145
Then show me
how to use that thing.

29:45.851 --> 29:47.151
I'll show you how to use it.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.290
Oh, feet shoulder-width apart.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.359
That's it.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.194
Good.

29:58.364 --> 30:00.097
You see that notch
in the rear site

30:00.099 --> 30:01.498
above the hammer there?

30:01.500 --> 30:03.066
I want you to line that up

30:03.068 --> 30:05.002
the front side
at the end of the barrel.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.838
Okay? That is how you hit
what you're aiming for.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.144
Now listen, you don't...
You don't pull the trigger.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.848
You squeeze.

30:21.921 --> 30:24.221
Oh, my god!

30:24.223 --> 30:26.557
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

30:26.559 --> 30:29.293
How about a strong black woman
with a gun?

30:29.295 --> 30:30.994
Hey, all right. Give it here.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.229
That's a lot of power.

30:33.532 --> 30:36.066
Why do you even need
something like that?

30:36.068 --> 30:37.334
Don't you pay people?

30:47.179 --> 30:49.046
Hey.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.849
So what happened
on August 8, 1969?

30:58.257 --> 30:59.389
Steve?

31:01.293 --> 31:03.560
What happened on August 8, 1969?

31:03.562 --> 31:04.928
I survived.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.499
An event like that
would affect anyone.

31:13.873 --> 31:14.972
Like I said,

31:15.574 --> 31:17.441
I'm here, they're not.

31:17.443 --> 31:19.042
That's a rather cold position.

31:20.279 --> 31:23.313
I took precautions
to keep my family safe.

31:24.917 --> 31:26.183
That was the only outcome.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.318
No guilt?

31:32.391 --> 31:35.492
Would you say it intensified
your experience in France?

31:37.129 --> 31:38.328
I had a goal.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.067
Something I'd wanted to do
for a long time.

31:44.069 --> 31:47.404
Something I felt
had not been done correctly.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.640
Anything that did
or did not happen in France

31:49.642 --> 31:51.074
was about that goal.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.013
And how would you characterize

31:56.015 --> 31:57.214
your marriage at the time?

31:57.216 --> 31:59.950
None of your goddamn business,
that's how.

31:59.952 --> 32:02.252
Steve, you said yourself,

32:02.254 --> 32:04.154
these sessions are about you
and Neile.

32:05.190 --> 32:07.291
What is it
with you shrinks, huh?

32:07.293 --> 32:09.459
You think that just because
you read a few books that...

32:09.461 --> 32:10.994
that makes you
some sort of an expert

32:10.996 --> 32:12.262
on how my being works?

32:14.133 --> 32:15.716
I'll tell you what, Doc.

32:15.717 --> 32:17.300
You could spend all damn day
walking around in my noggin',

32:17.303 --> 32:18.368
and you wouldn't know
the first thing

32:18.370 --> 32:20.470
about how it works.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.172
Would you say
you were this aggressive

32:22.174 --> 32:24.374
before the Benedict Canyon
murders?

32:24.376 --> 32:27.144
Yeah. Always.

32:27.146 --> 32:30.948
Aggressive about my career,
my women, my cars.

32:30.950 --> 32:32.716
If I want something, I get it.

32:34.253 --> 32:36.586
Goddamn anybody who gets
in my way, you understand?

32:39.558 --> 32:41.191
So your career
is important to you?

32:42.061 --> 32:43.260
Of course.

32:44.430 --> 32:47.331
It's just that
you mentioned it first.

32:48.033 --> 32:50.233
Your career.

32:50.235 --> 32:52.436
Without my career,
there's nothing else.

32:56.008 --> 32:58.308
I don't have any
rosy misconceptions about life.

33:02.548 --> 33:04.614
My folks were poor.

33:04.616 --> 33:06.316
I was poor for too long.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.654
The career is money.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.222
Everything follows the money.

33:14.259 --> 33:16.326
Did you feel this way
when you got married?

33:16.328 --> 33:18.562
Yes.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.530
But you were poor
when you got married.

33:20.532 --> 33:21.598
Yeah.

33:22.468 --> 33:23.567
Was your wife?

33:24.570 --> 33:26.370
No. What are you getting at?

33:26.372 --> 33:28.338
Just what your priorities were.

33:30.109 --> 33:31.375
You love your wife?

33:31.377 --> 33:32.676
Yes, I did. I do.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.213
You don't need money
for that, Steve.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.084
Did she provide
that security for you?

33:46.025 --> 33:48.392
I knew my wife would
never let me down.

33:50.763 --> 33:52.429
She would always support me.

33:55.034 --> 33:56.500
She would never abandon me.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.208
Tell me about him.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.810
I don't wanna do this right now.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.678
- Do what?
-Be interrogated.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.480
Not by you, you have no right.

34:10.482 --> 34:13.315
I have every damn right.
I'm your husband.

34:13.318 --> 34:15.152
You have no right,
not because you're my husband,

34:15.154 --> 34:16.420
because you're a hypocrite.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.155
Oh, this again?

34:18.157 --> 34:19.422
Parading women around all day.

34:19.425 --> 34:22.059
-What do you want from me?
- All night.

34:22.061 --> 34:23.627
I wanna be... I'm gonna be free.

34:23.629 --> 34:25.395
-Then be free.
-Everybody in this country

34:25.397 --> 34:27.664
is doing whatever the hell
they want. Why not me?

34:27.666 --> 34:30.434
You're supposed
to be my husband.

34:30.436 --> 34:31.735
You swore an oath to me.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.737
And that means something, Steve.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.239
Not having affairs

34:36.241 --> 34:39.309
and then confessing
because you feel bad.

34:39.311 --> 34:40.844
Do you know
how insulting that is?

34:40.846 --> 34:42.245
How embarrassing?

34:43.715 --> 34:46.283
You did the worst thing
you could ever do to a woman.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.353
You diminished me.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.255
You made me feel less than.

34:56.527 --> 35:00.297
And I have to pretend
like everything is fine.

35:00.299 --> 35:02.866
Like the dutiful wife
of Steve fucking McQueen.

35:08.874 --> 35:10.540
This beats Manhattan, huh?

35:11.643 --> 35:12.742
Hmm.

35:13.579 --> 35:14.811
I don't know.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.279
I'm so fond of the city.

35:17.616 --> 35:19.449
I still remember
the first day I saw it.

35:20.752 --> 35:23.220
It sure was a long way
from the Philippines.

35:23.222 --> 35:27.457
Well, everything is a long way
from the Philippines.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.426
Yeah, well,
we'll be back soon anyway.

35:31.130 --> 35:32.195
When?

35:33.198 --> 35:34.898
The Pat Boone Show, remember?

35:37.202 --> 35:39.336
Don't you need a break?

35:39.338 --> 35:41.738
You don't take breaks
if you can help it.

35:41.740 --> 35:44.474
Well, it's just... You're beat.

35:45.811 --> 35:48.278
It's a variety show,
I can handle it.

35:50.516 --> 35:51.915
Oh.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.283
I'll come with you then.

35:56.221 --> 35:58.655
Honey, I know it's been tough,
the last few months

35:58.657 --> 36:00.790
with our schedules, but, um...

36:00.792 --> 36:01.858
Well...

36:05.797 --> 36:07.497
I got something for you.

36:07.499 --> 36:10.233
Hey, well, if you're proposing,
you know, we're already married.

36:10.802 --> 36:12.202
Open it, silly.

36:19.211 --> 36:20.277
Well...

36:23.282 --> 36:25.448
It's St. Christopher.

36:25.450 --> 36:28.552
Patron saint of travelers,
and God knows we've traveled.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.888
He'll watch over you
when I can't.

36:32.925 --> 36:34.191
I love it.

36:45.304 --> 36:46.870
You remember that day
on Sixth Avenue?

36:52.811 --> 36:54.511
You told me I was pretty.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.715
You told me I was pretty, too.

36:59.818 --> 37:02.285
I certainly did.

37:02.287 --> 37:04.387
God, it was
like fireworks, baby.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.291
I want that moment again.

37:12.297 --> 37:14.331
That moment is gone.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.632
It's broken.

37:16.501 --> 37:17.767
We're broken.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.472
Why did you have
to do this to me?

37:40.492 --> 37:41.658
Look, I picked you up, I thought

37:41.660 --> 37:43.593
we could have some fun,
you know?

37:43.595 --> 37:45.729
You wanna see me talk,
go to the movies.

37:45.731 --> 37:46.997
To tell you the truth,
your movies

37:46.999 --> 37:48.298
really aren't for me.

37:48.300 --> 37:49.532
Is that so?

37:49.534 --> 37:52.435
Guns, cars. All that macho shit.

37:52.971 --> 37:54.604
Real life is one thing.

37:55.274 --> 37:57.540
Movies...

37:57.542 --> 38:00.410
Well, I don't get a thrill
from that stuff on the screen.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.912
I mean, you could come across
enough violence and aggression

38:02.914 --> 38:04.514
right outside your front door.

38:06.285 --> 38:07.550
Now the good stuff.

38:08.754 --> 38:11.488
The dream stuff.

38:11.490 --> 38:14.624
That's why I go to the movies,
to feel good.

38:18.297 --> 38:19.663
They're not all like that.

38:20.766 --> 38:22.399
Like what?

38:22.401 --> 38:25.535
My movies. They're not all
like you said, aggressive.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.406
Oh, I know.

38:34.479 --> 38:35.679
Then pick one.

38:36.315 --> 38:37.447
Why?

38:38.850 --> 38:40.850
I don't know. So I don't...

38:40.852 --> 38:42.952
So I don't feel
like I'm wasting my life.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.790
Love with the Proper Stranger.

38:48.894 --> 38:50.960
The Thomas Crown Affair.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.030
Sexy.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.499
Romantic.

38:58.070 --> 39:00.370
An escape from the every day.

39:00.372 --> 39:01.938
That's what I like.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.573
Like that's what I wanna give.

39:06.378 --> 39:09.112
So, you get to New York,
then what?

39:10.415 --> 39:12.082
How do you get to Carnegie Hall?

39:15.854 --> 39:17.587
Okay, if it doesn't happen?

39:17.589 --> 39:19.122
Well, was that
ever an option of you?

39:19.124 --> 39:20.390
Never.

39:20.392 --> 39:23.360
Well then, there you go.

39:23.362 --> 39:25.695
It's just, you know,
these cities, LA, New York,

39:25.697 --> 39:28.531
they chew up gals like you.
Chew 'em up and spit 'em out.

39:28.533 --> 39:29.899
Let 'em try.

39:29.901 --> 39:32.635
I'm better off
than I was a minute ago.

39:32.637 --> 39:35.505
I'm better off every second
I'm away from Weedpatch.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.808
There's no going back.

39:38.810 --> 39:41.010
Every girl in the big city
is running away

39:41.012 --> 39:42.846
from a place like Weedpatch.

39:42.848 --> 39:44.748
Don't you think I know that,
Steve McQueen?

39:45.951 --> 39:47.817
I know what I'm up against.

39:48.954 --> 39:52.489
My skin color, my... my gender.

39:52.491 --> 39:55.158
But I choose my fate,
not anybody else.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.561
Look, I'm not... You know,

39:58.563 --> 40:00.930
I'm not trying
to make you cross.

40:00.932 --> 40:03.433
It's just,
life ain't like the movies, kid.

40:04.436 --> 40:05.635
Don't I know it?

40:16.481 --> 40:18.047
You know, I trained
with Martha Graham.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.586
You did not train
with Martha Graham.

40:23.588 --> 40:24.954
Sure did.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.589
At the Neighborhood Playhouse.

40:28.460 --> 40:29.759
You could dance?

40:29.761 --> 40:31.127
Not a lick.

40:32.798 --> 40:34.597
Why didn't you stick with it?

40:34.599 --> 40:35.865
I had my reasons.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.636
Well, I bet
you were pretty good.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.771
-We'll never know.

40:41.773 --> 40:44.474
You never wanted
to do a musical?

40:44.476 --> 40:46.776
I miss the grand MGM musicals.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.180
Nobody wants to see me do that.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.883
Jimmy Cagney did musicals.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.954
Believe me, I know. It's just...

40:57.956 --> 41:00.690
I missed that period,
you know, I...

41:00.692 --> 41:03.059
A few years earlier, maybe,
who knows? But...

41:06.465 --> 41:07.764
It didn't hurt, did it?

41:09.100 --> 41:10.867
What's that?

41:10.869 --> 41:12.202
Telling me something.

41:14.005 --> 41:16.840
Well, you're Steve McQueen.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.609
You do whatever you want.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.611
We'll see about that.

41:21.613 --> 41:24.581
Steve McQueen,
song and dance man.

41:26.618 --> 41:28.551
People just want to see you
do one thing now.

41:28.553 --> 41:30.253
They wanna see me
get the bad guy.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.722
They wanna see me,
you know, win.

41:32.724 --> 41:34.391
And there's always some kid

41:34.392 --> 41:36.059
lookin' to knock you off
the top spot.

41:36.061 --> 41:38.695
All it takes is one bad choice.

41:38.697 --> 41:40.063
I'm not gonna let that happen.

41:42.901 --> 41:44.767
Well, it could've been
a hell of a thing.

43:20.665 --> 43:22.865
No, I haven't decided yet.
I get my end first.

43:22.867 --> 43:24.233
That's the deal, remember?

43:24.235 --> 43:27.070
-Get ready to be happy.

43:27.072 --> 43:28.972
Using my considerable charm,

43:28.974 --> 43:31.841
I was able to twist some arms
over at Warner Brothers.

43:31.843 --> 43:32.976
I'm listening.

43:32.978 --> 43:34.377
Turns out Warner Brothers
sold the car

43:34.379 --> 43:36.145
to a guy named Bob Ross.

43:36.147 --> 43:38.314
Worked in
the editing department.

43:38.316 --> 43:39.882
Good stuff. You got an address?

43:46.224 --> 43:47.323
Got it.

43:48.760 --> 43:50.159
Oh, wait, Steve!

43:50.161 --> 43:52.061
I always said
you're a standup guy, Freddie.

43:52.063 --> 43:54.063
You said you'd pick a movie.

43:54.065 --> 43:55.632
When I have the keys
in hand, Freddie.

43:55.634 --> 43:56.799
Keys in hand.

43:56.801 --> 43:58.735
Steve, you son of a bitch.
Just pick...

44:00.939 --> 44:02.338
God...

44:02.340 --> 44:04.407
-Son of a bitch.

44:09.814 --> 44:12.115
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay out here?

44:12.117 --> 44:15.385
The bus'll be along in a spell.
Don't you worry.

44:17.255 --> 44:19.656
Ah, it's too bad
you're not headed to LA.

44:19.658 --> 44:21.424
That city could use
more chicks like you.

44:22.227 --> 44:24.193
No.

44:24.195 --> 44:25.895
I'm afraid this is the end
of the road

44:25.897 --> 44:28.364
for us, Steve McQueen.

44:28.366 --> 44:30.833
You know, you can
just call me Steve.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.669
There's something
about your name that just begs

44:32.671 --> 44:34.003
for it to be said together.

44:39.144 --> 44:40.410
Hey, I know people in New York.

44:40.412 --> 44:42.045
You know, maybe
I can make some calls.

44:43.448 --> 44:45.314
We both know
that's not gonna happen.

44:47.285 --> 44:48.384
Well,

44:50.889 --> 44:52.121
safe travels then.

44:54.826 --> 44:56.392
I hope you find
what you're looking for,

44:57.095 --> 44:58.161
Steve.

44:59.931 --> 45:01.764
You know, you never
told me your name.

45:08.940 --> 45:10.339
Let's play something else.

46:34.058 --> 46:35.291
That's my name.

46:52.343 --> 46:54.010
Steve McQueen.

47:15.533 --> 47:16.549
It's time to go to work.

47:16.550 --> 47:17.566
You need to chose
your next picture carefully.

47:29.848 --> 47:31.614
I didn't think you came here.

47:31.616 --> 47:33.583
Surprise.

47:33.585 --> 47:35.918
Well, since you're here,
you'd indulge me.

47:35.920 --> 47:38.254
I just thought maybe I could get
some of your thoughts on this.

47:38.256 --> 47:40.056
I'm all ears.

47:40.058 --> 47:42.091
I mean, you read
the book, right?

47:42.093 --> 47:43.392
Yeah, my wife gave it to me.

47:46.931 --> 47:50.099
It's just,
you're attached to it, I mean...

47:50.101 --> 47:51.434
You are attached to it, right?

47:51.436 --> 47:53.135
Yeah. Well,
what's your question, Dustin?

47:53.137 --> 47:55.238
Oh, I'm just intrigued. I'm...

47:56.507 --> 47:58.407
circling, you know?

47:58.409 --> 48:00.142
I think there's a great story
to be told here.

48:00.144 --> 48:01.277
I think I'm interested.

48:01.279 --> 48:02.879
In what part? Mine?

48:02.881 --> 48:05.114
No. No.

48:05.116 --> 48:06.649
Dega.

48:06.651 --> 48:09.452
-Louis Dega, the counterfeiter?
- Mm-hm.

48:09.454 --> 48:11.454
I mean, there's definitely
something there.

48:11.456 --> 48:14.590
I've been reading books
of French penal colonies.

48:14.592 --> 48:16.425
Really fascinating stuff.

48:16.427 --> 48:18.160
Any idea who they wanna direct?

48:18.162 --> 48:19.262
I think it's Schaffner.

48:22.400 --> 48:24.500
Schaffner. Interesting.

48:43.154 --> 48:46.155
Well, I'd love to know
what you think.

48:46.157 --> 48:48.090
-About what?
-About the part.

48:48.092 --> 48:50.026
Your part? It's a...
It's a fine part.

48:50.028 --> 48:51.494
No, your part.

48:51.496 --> 48:54.964
If I do this, it can't just be
another buddy picture.

48:54.966 --> 48:57.133
It needs to go much deeper.

48:59.070 --> 49:01.270
I don't know what I got
next on my plate, kid.

49:01.272 --> 49:02.571
You know, whether it's something
you wanna do,

49:02.573 --> 49:04.273
is for you to decide.

49:04.275 --> 49:07.944
Do it, don't do it.
It doesn't matter to me.

49:07.946 --> 49:09.478
On the first day of shooting,
I may see your face,

49:09.480 --> 49:11.981
I may even be happy.
But right now,

49:11.983 --> 49:13.215
I don't give two shits.

49:14.719 --> 49:16.719
This is an uncomfortable
discourse for you.

49:17.555 --> 49:19.722
It's okay. I get it.

49:19.724 --> 49:22.358
Your uncomfortable
talking about the craft.

49:22.360 --> 49:24.560
I thought we were actors.

49:24.562 --> 49:26.195
Look, we are
two different actors.

49:26.197 --> 49:28.664
Me not talking about it,
doesn't mean I don't want to.

49:28.666 --> 49:31.067
But it may mean I don't wanna
talk about it with you.

49:31.069 --> 49:33.102
Yes. Yes!

49:33.104 --> 49:34.537
That's what I'm talking about.

49:34.539 --> 49:36.472
This right here, I felt it.

49:36.474 --> 49:39.375
Did you feel that? I mean,
we could be that. Right now.

49:39.377 --> 49:41.477
Confined. At wit's end.

49:42.647 --> 49:44.080
Have you spoken with Trumbo?

49:46.084 --> 49:47.183
No.

49:47.185 --> 49:49.586
Well, I phoned him.

49:49.587 --> 49:51.988
Now he seemed very open
to the idea of working with me

49:51.990 --> 49:53.589
on Dega's character.
Molding him.

49:53.591 --> 49:55.191
Really? You phoned Trumbo?

49:55.193 --> 49:56.759
Of course. I got thoughts.

49:56.761 --> 49:58.594
-He's got thoughts.
- Yeah, I got thoughts.

49:58.596 --> 50:00.262
I got ideas.

50:00.264 --> 50:03.499
Right now, Dega's character
is very thin.

50:03.501 --> 50:04.700
And you'd like to work
with the writer

50:04.702 --> 50:06.235
to make him bigger?

50:06.237 --> 50:07.436
Make him more...

50:08.639 --> 50:09.739
fleshed out.

50:10.675 --> 50:13.710
Fascinating.

50:13.711 --> 50:16.746
Yeah. Well, in Cherrier's book,
Dega is just a minor character.

50:16.748 --> 50:19.115
So you think
you should be bigger?

50:19.117 --> 50:21.717
Well, I think
he should be more...

50:21.719 --> 50:23.786
-Fleshed out.
-Fleshed out, exactly.

50:25.623 --> 50:28.024
Sounds like you've given this
a lot of thought.

50:28.026 --> 50:29.658
I have.

50:29.660 --> 50:31.060
You haven't signed yet, though.

50:31.062 --> 50:32.628
No.

50:32.630 --> 50:34.497
Why the cold feet?

50:34.499 --> 50:36.265
I'm just weighing my options.

50:36.267 --> 50:38.601
Trying to figure out
what works best for me.

50:39.604 --> 50:40.803
- Of course.
-Yeah.

50:42.407 --> 50:45.174
Do you know that
I did an entire film

50:45.810 --> 50:47.209
in Italian?

50:48.646 --> 50:49.745
I did not.

50:50.815 --> 50:53.149
That was a challenge.

50:53.151 --> 50:55.685
And that's
what I'm talking about.

50:55.686 --> 50:58.220
Maybe on this film,
we do the whole thing in French.

50:58.222 --> 51:00.289
Yeah, I don't think
the studio would go for that.

51:00.291 --> 51:02.425
Well, who cares
what the studios think?

51:02.427 --> 51:04.460
I mean, what do the studios
really know anyway?

51:04.462 --> 51:06.429
I mean, the studio
wouldn't know real art,

51:06.431 --> 51:09.465
if it walked right up to 'em,
kicked 'em square in the nuts.

51:11.469 --> 51:13.235
Has Freddie talked to you
about First Artists?

51:13.237 --> 51:14.303
He is my agent.

51:16.140 --> 51:17.339
And are you on board?

51:18.543 --> 51:21.444
Not that it's your business,
but not yet.

51:21.446 --> 51:23.179
Well, it could be my business.

51:23.181 --> 51:25.081
It could be
our business together.

51:25.083 --> 51:27.450
Think about it.

51:27.451 --> 51:29.818
A production company
completely run by the artists.

51:31.455 --> 51:33.088
You know, when something sounds
too good to be true,

51:33.091 --> 51:34.156
it usually is.

51:34.158 --> 51:36.592
Streisand, Poitier...

51:39.230 --> 51:41.130
-Newman.
- Newman.

51:41.132 --> 51:42.398
Exactly.

51:42.399 --> 51:43.665
Why should we be left out
in the cold?

51:43.668 --> 51:45.267
Who said we would be?

51:45.269 --> 51:46.635
There's other ways
to get control.

51:46.637 --> 51:47.837
I got plenty of juice.

51:48.673 --> 51:50.172
That's not what I hear.

51:51.275 --> 51:52.675
Be careful what you hear.

51:52.677 --> 51:54.610
People talk in this town, Steve.

51:54.612 --> 51:56.545
I mean, your racing picture's
in trouble.

51:56.547 --> 51:59.315
And Solar's deal,
it's on the ropes.

52:00.218 --> 52:01.851
What is this?

52:01.852 --> 52:03.485
You don't need my permission,
not to play Dega.

52:03.488 --> 52:06.322
Not to join First Artists.

52:06.324 --> 52:09.592
Are you looking for approval?
'Cause I'm not your daddy.

52:09.594 --> 52:11.260
Or maybe you're just looking
for a little insurance,

52:11.262 --> 52:12.328
is that it?

52:12.730 --> 52:14.497
Maybe.

52:14.499 --> 52:17.133
I'm trying to wrap my head
around the idea

52:17.135 --> 52:18.834
of being a team player.

52:18.836 --> 52:21.770
And if Steve McQueen
can be a team player,

52:21.772 --> 52:23.205
I guess I could, too.

52:25.343 --> 52:26.809
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, kid.

52:28.379 --> 52:30.446
All my decisions come
in due time.

52:32.416 --> 52:33.482
This is good.

52:34.519 --> 52:35.651
It feels right.

52:37.288 --> 52:39.155
I think I wanna play Dega.

52:39.157 --> 52:40.256
I think you're a good actor.

52:42.727 --> 52:44.894
You may even be great,
but make no mistake,

52:44.896 --> 52:47.263
I don't care if it's Trumbo,

52:47.265 --> 52:49.832
Shaffner or anybody else
blowing smoke up your ass.

52:51.569 --> 52:54.336
That set will be mine,
you got that?

54:28.366 --> 54:29.431
A lot of actors I see

54:29.433 --> 54:30.933
worry about losing
the spotlight.

54:31.936 --> 54:33.402
Never been a concern.

54:34.672 --> 54:35.738
Until now.

54:39.977 --> 54:41.310
Tell me about France.

54:42.913 --> 54:44.780
Tell me about Le Mans.

54:44.782 --> 54:46.515
They took the film away from me.

54:47.451 --> 54:48.517
Who did?

54:49.287 --> 54:50.552
The suits...

54:50.554 --> 54:51.854
at Cinema Center.

54:53.057 --> 54:54.323
The producers,

54:55.326 --> 54:57.326
Stulbarg and Bob Rosen.

54:58.596 --> 55:00.796
-Friends?
-No. Not really.

55:01.599 --> 55:02.765
Lost them too, though.

55:04.869 --> 55:06.302
Misunderstandings.

55:06.737 --> 55:07.836
Betrayals.

55:09.707 --> 55:11.340
My business partner, Bob,

55:12.710 --> 55:14.510
then it was Stan, my agent.

55:15.579 --> 55:18.047
Where were they
when I needed them, huh?

55:18.049 --> 55:20.082
Nowhere I'll tell you, so...

55:20.084 --> 55:21.350
...cut them loose.

55:23.387 --> 55:24.453
Have you seen it?

55:25.389 --> 55:26.455
I did.

55:27.958 --> 55:29.024
And?

55:30.528 --> 55:32.461
There were problems.

55:32.463 --> 55:36.432
We had a lot of guys, good guys,
looking to crack that story.

55:36.434 --> 55:38.867
We had John, directing,
Sturges. You know him?

55:39.503 --> 55:41.437
I know of him.

55:41.439 --> 55:43.038
Did three pictures with him

55:43.040 --> 55:44.473
and he walked out on me.

55:45.676 --> 55:46.875
Walked out on a movie?

55:46.877 --> 55:47.976
No. On me.

55:52.016 --> 55:53.482
Would you agree that

55:53.484 --> 55:54.883
films are
a collaborative effort?

55:54.885 --> 55:56.819
No. Not on Le Mans.

55:56.821 --> 55:57.986
This was my vision.

55:59.023 --> 56:00.356
I knew what I wanted.

56:01.759 --> 56:03.726
That's not always
easily expressed.

56:05.062 --> 56:06.662
I don't know how clear
I gotta be.

56:10.901 --> 56:12.968
Sounds like
a stressful situation.

56:12.970 --> 56:14.870
And then some, Doc.

56:17.742 --> 56:19.608
So I imagine, the probable
outcome for the film

56:19.610 --> 56:20.676
is not good.

56:20.978 --> 56:22.111
Nope.

56:24.749 --> 56:26.949
As a man that is judged
by his peers...

56:28.085 --> 56:30.386
based on reviews
and box office receipts,

56:30.388 --> 56:31.854
this must be a bitter pill.

56:33.758 --> 56:35.524
Le Mans
was your passion project.

56:36.627 --> 56:38.127
A convergence
of the two things that

56:38.129 --> 56:40.496
you pretty much
dedicated your life to.

56:42.433 --> 56:45.768
Any accolades or awards
would mean affirmation.

56:45.770 --> 56:47.870
Affirmation of your vision.

56:47.872 --> 56:49.838
I got awards, nominations.

56:49.840 --> 56:50.939
Don't need them.

56:52.143 --> 56:53.609
An Academy Award?

56:53.611 --> 56:54.710
Nominated.

56:55.946 --> 56:57.012
Once.

57:03.020 --> 57:04.787
You're a box office champion.

57:04.789 --> 57:06.622
Right.

57:06.624 --> 57:08.657
You have a strong drive
to win, Steve.

57:09.960 --> 57:11.460
And both awards and...

57:13.030 --> 57:14.997
box office receipts

57:14.999 --> 57:17.433
constitute the pinnacle
of winning in Hollywood.

57:18.702 --> 57:21.003
You didn't hope
to achieve this with Le Mans?

57:22.706 --> 57:25.174
Look, you want every movie
to be a success.

57:28.212 --> 57:30.679
Even if Le Mans
succeeds at the box office

57:30.681 --> 57:32.181
or at the Academy Awards,

57:33.884 --> 57:36.685
I don't think you're
gonna consider it a success.

57:36.687 --> 57:37.853
No, I won't.

57:39.557 --> 57:41.457
Because it was taken
away from you.

57:41.459 --> 57:42.558
It's not your film.

57:45.796 --> 57:47.596
You sacrificed a lot
for this film.

57:48.999 --> 57:50.132
More than you know.

57:52.069 --> 57:53.168
I want to know.

57:54.805 --> 57:56.905
I want you to tell me,
that's why we're here.

57:56.907 --> 57:58.774
We're here
because Neile asked me to.

58:02.780 --> 58:03.879
It was a long shoot.

58:05.549 --> 58:06.615
An arduous shoot.

58:08.719 --> 58:11.253
Women,
drugs fill the down time?

58:13.591 --> 58:14.656
It didn't hurt.

58:23.234 --> 58:24.500
So,

58:25.236 --> 58:26.502
that night.

58:32.076 --> 58:33.876
I don't wanna talk
about that night.

58:35.679 --> 58:37.679
We've come a long way
here today, Steve.

58:39.183 --> 58:40.949
I think we need
to talk about it.

58:45.723 --> 58:48.290
What did you do that night
at the chateau in France?

58:51.929 --> 58:54.229
Steve, what did
you do that night?

59:09.880 --> 59:11.580
I put a gun in my wife's head.

59:14.051 --> 59:16.051
Why did you put a gun
to your wife's head?

59:20.024 --> 59:22.057
Because she told me
she had an affair.

59:24.728 --> 59:27.195
She already knew
of your indiscretions?

59:27.197 --> 59:29.698
Yeah. I always confessed.

59:31.335 --> 59:32.868
But that
only helped you...

59:33.270 --> 59:34.336
with your guilt.

59:40.878 --> 59:41.777
What else did you do?

59:45.783 --> 59:46.848
Steve?

59:52.256 --> 59:54.623
I hurt her.

59:59.229 --> 01:00:00.362
I hurt my wife.

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:02.931
I keep hurting her.

01:00:09.173 --> 01:00:10.639
Why would you hurt your wife?

01:00:17.715 --> 01:00:19.081
I can't stop.

01:00:25.089 --> 01:00:26.188
Tell me about him.

01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:28.290
I already have.

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:29.925
-Tell me again.
-No!

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:33.362
Where did you meet him?

01:00:33.364 --> 01:00:34.796
Where did you meet him? Hm?

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:36.164
Stop. Don't do this to yourself.

01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:40.335
Where did you meet him?

01:00:40.337 --> 01:00:42.704
Steve, stop, please.

01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:44.306
- Where did you meet him?

01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:46.141
On a plane.

01:00:47.244 --> 01:00:48.977
On a plane, I already told you.

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:52.881
Where did you do it?

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:54.282
-Where did you do it?
-I don't remember.

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:56.051
-Hm?
-Steve, stop.

01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:57.285
Where did you do it?

01:00:57.287 --> 01:00:58.720
Stop!

01:00:58.722 --> 01:01:00.355
I'm so sorry.

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:01.423
I'm sorry, baby.

01:01:01.425 --> 01:01:03.325
-Where?
-I'm so sorry.

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:06.928
At Beverly Hills Hotel.

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:08.096
I can't hear you.

01:01:08.098 --> 01:01:09.865
Beverly Hills Hotel.

01:01:13.137 --> 01:01:14.203
-What room?

01:01:14.204 --> 01:01:15.270
-What room?
- I don't remember

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:16.838
the goddamn room!

01:01:22.446 --> 01:01:24.146
- Who started it?
-I don't...

01:01:24.148 --> 01:01:25.347
-I don't know.
- Who started it?

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:27.115
Maybe me, maybe him.
I don't remember.

01:01:27.117 --> 01:01:29.718
No maybes.
Who started it?

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.088
He did. He did. He said hello,
I told him my name.

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.424
Oh, he knew who you were, baby.
Make no mistake.

01:01:35.426 --> 01:01:37.159
Yes, he knew who I was.

01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:39.361
He fucked you because of me.

01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:41.196
He fucked me because of you.

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:54.776
Why did you do this, huh?

01:01:54.778 --> 01:01:56.778
I'm tired, baby.
Let's please stop.

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:58.280
This is what you get.

01:01:58.282 --> 01:01:59.815
Whoring around.

01:01:59.817 --> 01:02:01.483
With another fucking actor.

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:04.453
Humiliate me?

01:02:04.455 --> 01:02:06.455
I'm tired, baby.
Can we please stop?

01:02:09.727 --> 01:02:10.792
Did you enjoy it?

01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:13.228
Did you enjoy it?

01:02:18.869 --> 01:02:21.069
Was he better than me?

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:24.306
- Did you enjoy it? Huh?
-Stop it. Please.

01:02:24.308 --> 01:02:26.875
-Did you enjoy it?
-Stop it!

01:02:26.877 --> 01:02:29.478
- Huh?
-Stop. For the last time, yes!

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:30.946
Yes, I did!

01:02:37.454 --> 01:02:38.520
Thanks.

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:43.158
I've been thinking about
what's next.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.760
For you?

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.361
Yeah. I mean, the Vegas gig
is over,

01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:49.264
and, well,
I gotta think about what's next.

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:52.768
Variety shows are fine,
but I don't know.

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:55.804
I'm gonna try something new,
something different.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:02:59.541
Well, you know,

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:01.142
things are going really good
for me right now, so...

01:03:02.813 --> 01:03:04.012
So?

01:03:04.014 --> 01:03:05.080
Well, so...

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:08.416
you know, we had a hard year.

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:11.386
Like you said, being apart.

01:03:13.824 --> 01:03:15.924
Well, both of us
working, it's...

01:03:15.926 --> 01:03:17.526
It's no way to begin a marriage.

01:03:17.528 --> 01:03:18.794
Well, yeah. I know.

01:03:19.797 --> 01:03:21.463
What do you have in mind?

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:23.130
Well, we are married,
you know, there's...

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.800
no reason why
we shouldn't have a family

01:03:24.802 --> 01:03:26.001
like everyone else.

01:03:30.073 --> 01:03:31.173
Hm.

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:44.052
-Family, huh?
-Yeah.

01:03:44.054 --> 01:03:45.387
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:03:45.389 --> 01:03:47.455
Yeah?

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:50.292
How many kids exactly,
Mr. McQueen?

01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:52.227
I don't know. Let's see, uh...

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:55.597
five, ten, a hundred?

01:03:55.599 --> 01:03:57.365
As many as we can make,
Mrs. McQueen.

01:03:57.367 --> 01:03:59.000
Oh, really?

01:04:00.904 --> 01:04:02.170
You're gonna see, baby.
I'm going all the way

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:03.271
to the top.

01:04:03.273 --> 01:04:05.373
I'm not letting anybody
kick me off.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:06.441
Not ever.

01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:08.276
Hm.

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:21.623
I'm sorry.

01:04:22.926 --> 01:04:25.493
I'm so, so sorry.

01:04:27.097 --> 01:04:29.164
This is going to end
one day, baby.

01:04:30.601 --> 01:04:33.635
That night in France
and every night in between...

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:37.072
is one step closer

01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:39.241
because I'll be dead.

01:04:42.446 --> 01:04:44.246
Because you killed me.

01:06:20.978 --> 01:06:22.077
No.

01:06:29.419 --> 01:06:30.485
No.

01:06:31.288 --> 01:06:32.387
No.

01:06:34.191 --> 01:06:35.590
Oh, no.

01:06:39.429 --> 01:06:40.528
No.

01:06:44.001 --> 01:06:46.067
No, no, no.

01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:50.071
No.

01:07:29.112 --> 01:07:31.146
This is going to end
one day, baby.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.183
You're Steve McQueen.

01:07:38.255 --> 01:07:39.988
You hemorrhage your money

01:07:39.989 --> 01:07:41.722
and you burn every goddamn
bridge back in France!

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:44.292
You can do whatever you want.

01:07:47.397 --> 01:07:48.596
You diminished me.

01:07:51.802 --> 01:07:54.335
People just want to see you
do one thing now.

01:07:54.337 --> 01:07:55.737
I mean, they wanna see me
get a bad guy.

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:57.305
They wanna see me,
you know, win.

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:00.025
And there's always
some kid

01:08:00.026 --> 01:08:01.509
lookin' to knock you off
the top spot.

01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:06.614
You're a movie star, Steve.

01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:08.450
Surely, that comes
with its own set of...

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:10.285
burdens.

01:08:10.654 --> 01:08:11.719
Just pick.

01:08:14.157 --> 01:08:15.590
You swore an oath to me.

01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:20.694
You know what's really
chapping my hide, Freddie?

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:24.265
What happened on August 8, 1969?

01:08:26.236 --> 01:08:27.368
It's not the car.

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:41.749
Because you killed me.

01:09:05.876 --> 01:09:07.742
For the last time, yes!

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:21.456
Hard road to hoe.

01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:25.393
What do you know?

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:28.429
I know
what you're thinking.

01:09:35.305 --> 01:09:37.671
Always you and the toys.

01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:39.674
They just got bigger.

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:45.246
Yeah, well, I ain't hanging on
to this one.

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:46.881
Why not? It's lovely.

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:50.785
It's not right.

01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:53.488
I mean, if it ain't right,
you just get rid of it?

01:09:58.395 --> 01:09:59.794
We still talking about cars?

01:10:01.665 --> 01:10:03.665
William walked out on me too,
remember?

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:06.834
I was a baby.

01:10:10.407 --> 01:10:11.606
I found him, you know.

01:10:12.676 --> 01:10:13.741
Long Beach.

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:16.477
A goddamn stones' throw away.

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:20.515
What did he have to say
for himself?

01:10:22.953 --> 01:10:24.752
The son of a bitch
was already dead.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:32.760
Never even saw his face.

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:36.397
Look in the mirror, sweetheart.

01:10:43.273 --> 01:10:44.672
It was always so easy for you.

01:10:45.742 --> 01:10:47.008
Oh, you don't say.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:50.411
You'd just take off,

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:52.247
send me away.

01:10:53.516 --> 01:10:54.916
I raised you, boy.

01:10:56.386 --> 01:10:57.852
Uncle Claude raised me.

01:10:59.422 --> 01:11:00.989
I needed to do right
by me.

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.994
What about me?

01:11:05.996 --> 01:11:08.596
It wasn't all bad,
there were some good ones.

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:11.399
Some.

01:11:11.835 --> 01:11:13.401
Berri?

01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:14.636
Yeah, where were you
when he was using me

01:11:14.638 --> 01:11:15.770
as his punching bag?

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:18.740
You needed discipline.

01:11:18.742 --> 01:11:20.475
You acted up.

01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:22.310
I defended myself.

01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:24.479
You think it was easy for me?

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:25.847
Oh, I'm sure the booze helped.

01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:29.651
A single mother at that time?

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:34.589
I was damaged goods,
and the whole town knew it.

01:11:34.591 --> 01:11:36.824
You think
you were such a peach?

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:39.961
Oh, you were wild, boy. Wild.

01:11:41.398 --> 01:11:42.730
I wonder why that was.

01:11:46.336 --> 01:11:48.336
There were
some good times.

01:11:50.407 --> 01:11:52.874
It's a miracle I even survived.

01:11:52.876 --> 01:11:54.942
Are you looking for excuses?

01:11:56.913 --> 01:11:59.881
Honey, you have the whole world.

01:11:59.883 --> 01:12:01.816
The whole world
at your fingertips.

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:03.718
You have everything.

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:05.486
How do you think
I got that, huh?

01:12:09.492 --> 01:12:10.692
You?

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:11.893
I built this. Me.
Plain and simple.

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:16.964
Hm. So easy to see the road,

01:12:16.966 --> 01:12:19.400
when you're walking on
the people that paved the way.

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:27.575
At least I'm here
for my children.

01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:29.777
You're doing
a bang-up job with that.

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:42.957
You need to get straight, son.

01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:45.760
Your wife don't deserve
what she's been given.

01:12:51.034 --> 01:12:52.701
Oh, forgive me

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:54.369
if my knees
don't quake at your wisdom.

01:12:55.572 --> 01:12:57.472
It's not about me.

01:12:57.474 --> 01:12:58.806
You're a grown man.

01:13:00.377 --> 01:13:02.910
Things are bad, I know.

01:13:02.912 --> 01:13:04.045
They could be better.

01:13:06.983 --> 01:13:09.050
You never let that
stop you before.

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:11.953
Things
get a little more complicated

01:13:11.955 --> 01:13:13.054
when you're me.

01:13:15.925 --> 01:13:18.893
And who are you exactly?

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:29.470
I oughta get going.

01:13:29.472 --> 01:13:31.639
Now where are you going to, boy?

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:35.576
I got some things to sort out.

01:13:37.013 --> 01:13:39.914
The things you got
ain't easily sorted out.

01:13:41.951 --> 01:13:43.751
But if anyone can do it,

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:45.953
it's you.

01:15:08.738 --> 01:15:11.138
¶ I just want it to rain ¶

01:15:12.542 --> 01:15:14.242
¶ Honey, I ain't tough ¶

01:15:15.879 --> 01:15:18.079
¶ I just want it to rain ¶

01:15:18.081 --> 01:15:22.617
¶ Down on me
'Cause I ain't sad enough ¶

01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:25.253
¶ I need to find ¶

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:29.190
¶ My way home ¶

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.226
¶ 'Cause I wanna see ¶

01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:36.898
¶ How it feels
To be not alone ¶

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:40.768
¶ But it's hard ¶

01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:43.638
¶ So hard to realize ¶

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:47.675
¶ When the sun gets in my eyes¶

01:15:50.547 --> 01:15:56.150
¶ When the sun gets in my eyes¶

01:16:26.916 --> 01:16:28.015
Hello, engine.

01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:31.819
You a mechanic?

01:16:32.589 --> 01:16:34.139
I dabble.

01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:35.690
You mind not dabbling
on a stranger's car?

01:16:36.292 --> 01:16:37.925
Sorry, kid.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:39.660
Just haven't seen one of these
in a while.

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:41.329
Where you been?

01:16:42.665 --> 01:16:43.731
Away.

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:46.000
Is that yours?

01:16:47.003 --> 01:16:48.603
Sort of.

01:16:48.605 --> 01:16:49.904
You been around
a lot of Chargers?

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.173
You could say that.

01:16:53.309 --> 01:16:55.176
440 Torqueflite.

01:16:55.178 --> 01:16:56.611
She's a real power plant.

01:16:56.613 --> 01:16:57.678
Yeah.

01:16:59.082 --> 01:17:00.948
That's a lot of car
for a kid like you.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.818
You rob banks?

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:05.186
Nah, it's not mine.

01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:08.723
Your pa's?

01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:10.291
Foster dad's.

01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:11.792
He lets me work on it.

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:12.860
Yeah?

01:17:13.696 --> 01:17:14.829
He let you drive it?

01:17:18.868 --> 01:17:20.201
He gave you that though,
didn't he?

01:17:22.672 --> 01:17:23.771
You gotta name, kid?

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:26.140
Rodney.

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:28.042
I'm Steve.

01:17:34.951 --> 01:17:37.218
You know, Rodney, it's not
always gonna be like this.

01:17:39.756 --> 01:17:41.922
Boys grow into men.

01:17:41.924 --> 01:17:43.190
It's the one thing
we got going for us.

01:17:44.727 --> 01:17:45.793
You got a plan?

01:17:46.963 --> 01:17:48.129
What kind of plan?

01:17:48.131 --> 01:17:49.730
You know,
for when you get out of here.

01:17:51.067 --> 01:17:52.133
I don't know.

01:17:53.236 --> 01:17:54.869
I like cars.

01:17:54.871 --> 01:17:56.871
Do what you wanna do
but always...

01:17:56.873 --> 01:17:58.005
always have a plan.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:02.376
Did you have a plan?

01:18:02.378 --> 01:18:03.978
Well, not always.

01:18:07.717 --> 01:18:08.916
You seem to be okay now.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.053
Well, you'd be surprised.

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:16.290
Hey, Rodney.

01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:19.894
You know this guy?

01:18:21.064 --> 01:18:22.697
Yeah. Mr. Ross.

01:18:23.366 --> 01:18:24.432
Yeah, that's him.

01:18:27.103 --> 01:18:28.869
Thanks, kid.

01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:31.305
Good meeting you, mister...

01:18:48.157 --> 01:18:49.957
Holy shit!

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:51.959
-Steve McQueen?
- All right, Ross.

01:18:52.428 --> 01:18:53.728
Where is it?

01:18:55.098 --> 01:18:57.732
Uh, I'm afraid, I, I, don't know

01:18:57.734 --> 01:18:59.233
what you're talking about,
Mr. McQueen.

01:19:00.136 --> 01:19:01.869
You're Ross, Robert Ross, right?

01:19:02.371 --> 01:19:03.437
Yes.

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:04.739
You know what I'm talking about.

01:19:06.042 --> 01:19:07.108
The car?

01:19:08.377 --> 01:19:10.444
What car?

01:19:10.446 --> 01:19:12.980
The car. The Mustang GT 390.

01:19:14.383 --> 01:19:15.983
Oh.

01:19:15.985 --> 01:19:18.986
The Mustang, sure. Yeah.

01:19:18.988 --> 01:19:22.323
I know Warner Brothers
sold it to you. I want it back.

01:19:22.325 --> 01:19:25.092
I'll give you a fair price,
but don't, don't hustle me, Bob.

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:27.194
Hustle you.

01:19:27.864 --> 01:19:28.963
Steve...

01:19:30.199 --> 01:19:32.299
I... I sold it.

01:19:36.038 --> 01:19:38.139
Uh, I only kept it
about a year,

01:19:38.141 --> 01:19:39.306
you know, it was just...

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:41.809
It was just too much car for me.

01:19:41.811 --> 01:19:43.811
And with gas prices
going up and all.

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:49.517
For what it's worth,

01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.553
it was a...

01:19:52.555 --> 01:19:54.855
Man, it was
a real honor to drive.

01:19:54.857 --> 01:19:57.825
You were Frank Bullitt.

01:19:58.361 --> 01:19:59.827
It's my favorite movie.

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:02.263
Can I ask you a question?

01:20:03.566 --> 01:20:05.032
Fire away.

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:06.499
You really do
all that driving?

01:20:09.338 --> 01:20:10.805
What do you do again, Bob?

01:20:11.541 --> 01:20:13.207
Oh, I'm in the pictures, too.

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:16.177
Doing what exactly?

01:20:16.179 --> 01:20:17.945
I work
in the editing department.

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:22.416
Anything I've seen?

01:20:23.519 --> 01:20:25.286
No, probably none.

01:20:26.923 --> 01:20:28.623
You...

01:20:28.624 --> 01:20:30.324
You look a little winded,
Mr. McQueen.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:32.459
Can I get you a drink
or something?

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:36.397
I'll get some cereal, anything.

01:20:36.399 --> 01:20:37.565
I'm gonna get going now, Bob.

01:20:39.135 --> 01:20:41.035
Wait, wait, uh...

01:20:41.037 --> 01:20:43.537
I can get you the information
of the fella I sold it to.

01:20:43.539 --> 01:20:44.939
That won't be necessary.

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:47.341
You take care.

01:20:49.212 --> 01:20:50.277
Well...

01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:52.947
Bye.

01:20:57.286 --> 01:20:58.385
Cereal.

01:21:10.466 --> 01:21:11.599
Hey, boy.

01:21:16.305 --> 01:21:17.872
Hey, boy.

01:21:17.873 --> 01:21:19.440
You forgot to put
the tool set away here last--

01:21:33.389 --> 01:21:36.290
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. whoa.

01:21:36.292 --> 01:21:38.292
Wait a sec. Wait a sec.

01:21:39.195 --> 01:21:40.427
You see that kid there?

01:21:40.429 --> 01:21:42.129
Him and me are pals now.

01:21:42.131 --> 01:21:44.298
-Say you understand.
-I understand.

01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:47.501
If anything happens to him,
I'm coming back for you.

01:21:47.503 --> 01:21:49.270
I understand, understand.

01:21:50.373 --> 01:21:51.472
You got a name?

01:21:51.474 --> 01:21:53.540
Irv. Irving.

01:21:53.542 --> 01:21:55.009
Put your hand down, Irv.

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:57.511
I will come back.

01:21:59.315 --> 01:22:00.414
Good talk, Irv.

01:22:05.688 --> 01:22:07.221
He won't be bothering
you anymore.

01:22:08.591 --> 01:22:10.124
You don't need
his damn car either.

01:22:10.126 --> 01:22:11.258
Are you serious?

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:12.526
Serious as taxes.

01:22:12.528 --> 01:22:14.962
I don't know what to say.

01:22:14.964 --> 01:22:16.964
You don't have
to say a thing, kid.

01:22:16.966 --> 01:22:18.599
You might want to check
the water pump.

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:19.700
Not a problem.

01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:22.002
Hey, who are you?

01:23:05.381 --> 01:23:07.548
See yourself
making movies forever?

01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:09.516
We don't get forever, do we?

01:23:09.518 --> 01:23:10.684
You know, I mean...

01:23:10.686 --> 01:23:12.987
I know, and I'll tell you.

01:23:12.989 --> 01:23:15.622
Forever would be a long time.

01:23:15.624 --> 01:23:18.459
There'll be a day
in the future where...

01:23:18.461 --> 01:23:20.494
no one would really care
about the films I make.

01:23:21.364 --> 01:23:22.596
There'll be someone new.

01:23:23.265 --> 01:23:24.398
Something new.

01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:28.669
I think about, sometimes,
that if you were to

01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:31.271
plant me in the future,

01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:33.107
I don't think anyone
would notice me.

01:23:34.377 --> 01:23:35.709
I'd be like a fly
on the wall.

01:23:36.412 --> 01:23:38.012
Just me.

01:23:38.014 --> 01:23:39.480
Anonymous.

01:23:39.482 --> 01:23:40.714
That seems hard
to believe.

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:43.684
Now, look,

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:45.586
I know one day I'll be
looking back on the journey.

01:23:45.588 --> 01:23:47.154
It'll all be in the past.

01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:54.612
Only in my memories.

01:23:54.613 --> 01:23:55.529
There'll be mistakes
and triumphs.

01:23:57.666 --> 01:23:59.066
That's part of the journey.

01:24:01.437 --> 01:24:02.803
It'll be quite the tale.

01:24:02.805 --> 01:24:04.071
Then what?

01:24:05.608 --> 01:24:06.740
After the movies?

01:24:10.246 --> 01:24:11.478
Probably just head to Mexico.

01:25:38.234 --> 01:25:41.869
¶ I'm slippin' ¶

01:25:41.871 --> 01:25:44.371
¶ I'm alive ¶

01:25:44.373 --> 01:25:47.307
¶ What I know is all a lie ¶

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:50.744
¶ All I know
Is I don't want you ¶

01:25:52.815 --> 01:25:53.881
¶ Yeah! ¶

01:26:02.725 --> 01:26:04.158
¶ Fire ¶

01:26:18.707 --> 01:26:22.409
¶ Sometimes, I get so quiet ¶

01:26:22.411 --> 01:26:28.415
¶ You might not see me so high¶

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:32.486
¶ Sound of breaking glass
I should have warned you ¶

01:26:32.488 --> 01:26:35.656
¶ I might be stopping by ¶

01:26:35.658 --> 01:26:39.226
¶ Each morning
The sun tells my story ¶

01:26:39.228 --> 01:26:42.863
¶ As it casts a shadow
On my face ¶

01:26:42.865 --> 01:26:46.800
¶ Oh, the night before
My cheek to the floor ¶

01:26:46.802 --> 01:26:48.902
¶ Flags waving me in ¶

01:26:50.239 --> 01:26:54.841
¶ It was just a race ¶

01:26:54.843 --> 01:26:58.245
¶ Tearing through
The linens of satin ¶

01:26:58.247 --> 01:27:02.449
¶ Like a dog
Pissing on the streets ¶

01:27:02.451 --> 01:27:05.852
¶ They walk home
With the trophy ¶

01:27:05.854 --> 01:27:09.756
¶ I'm waking up
With a plea ¶

01:27:09.758 --> 01:27:13.393
¶ Come a long way from Slater ¶

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:16.997
¶ I haven't seen much
Of the fall ¶

01:27:16.999 --> 01:27:20.834
¶ I miss the breeze
Through the windows ¶

01:27:20.836 --> 01:27:23.637
¶ The least I got is dirt ¶

01:27:23.639 --> 01:27:27.407
¶ Is dirt to keep me warm ¶

01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:30.944
¶ Wink and a grin
The whole world's a circus ¶

01:27:30.946 --> 01:27:34.615
