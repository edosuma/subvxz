00:13.633 --> 00:16.067
SUE: (GROANS)
Weather happens to be king.

00:16.133 --> 00:17.667
Right now, it's kind of like,

00:18.300 --> 00:20.400
a little broken blue,
but a lot of fog there.

00:22.367 --> 00:23.733
A lot of fog there.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.400
A lot of fog there.

00:26.933 --> 00:29.867
And that means I have
to gauge how many days
of fuel do I have left.

00:29.933 --> 00:31.233
Not weeks, days.

00:37.433 --> 00:41.667
NARRATOR: Kavik River Camp
serves as a remote fuelling
station and emergency depot,

00:41.733 --> 00:44.467
197 miles above
the Arctic Circle.

00:45.800 --> 00:51.100
As Kavik's sole proprietor,
Sue Aikens must ensure that
the camp is equipped with fuel

00:51.200 --> 00:54.167
and power to serve clients,
and for her survival

00:54.300 --> 00:56.400
in the harsh conditions
of the tundra.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
SUE: Shit.

01:31.700 --> 01:32.800
Shit.

01:37.667 --> 01:41.100
Fuck. Well, generator
just crapped out on me.

01:42.367 --> 01:45.533
That was a pretty quick
drop in the electrics.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.967
Well, never ends.

01:51.833 --> 01:56.433
(GROANS) Generator has
a God Box that tells you
what happened.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.900
"Why did I shut myself down?"
Well, high water temperature.

02:02.133 --> 02:05.767
First thing I notice when
I'm looking at the gen is,
that there's a lot of fluff.

02:06.033 --> 02:07.333
Maybe a little bit of oil.

02:08.133 --> 02:10.433
This is the radiator
for the coolant.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.433
Well, logic says first place
I gotta look is in here,

02:13.500 --> 02:16.233
and you can see it looks like
a fur carpet in there,

02:16.300 --> 02:19.867
something straight out
of the '70s. A lot of fluff,
a lot of fuzz there.

02:19.933 --> 02:22.900
Because it's dry,
because we're
getting closer to winter,

02:22.967 --> 02:25.167
it's gonna collect everywhere.

02:27.467 --> 02:29.967
Simple fix. I just gotta
give it time, cool down,

02:30.967 --> 02:36.833
get the fuzz from the back
side of that radiator,
and then work on it.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.133
Tear it apart and clean it.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.300
So, camp will go without power
for a little bit today.

02:41.467 --> 02:44.467
Doesn't matter what I had
lined out for my day,
it just changed.

02:44.733 --> 02:46.700
So just like the weather
changes in a heartbeat,

02:46.767 --> 02:48.500
you can never time
a breakdown.

02:48.567 --> 02:50.867
I'll wait till it cools down,

02:50.933 --> 02:54.033
start wrenching on it,
tearing it apart, cleaning it,
and putting it back together.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.833
CHIP: Everything has its use
and its limits,

03:02.900 --> 03:04.233
and I take them to the limit.

03:14.367 --> 03:16.167
19, 20, 21,

03:16.233 --> 03:19.200
22, 23, 24, 25...
Oh, excellent.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.600
So I'm gonna make a frame
tent on a sled.

03:22.733 --> 03:23.967
I live here
in Noorvik, Alaska.

03:25.367 --> 03:26.533
I have a permanent house here.

03:27.933 --> 03:29.933
And I live in camps,
rotating around,

03:30.000 --> 03:31.733
back and forth, for seven,
eight months of the year.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.567
We travel pretty far,

03:35.500 --> 03:36.800
and we tent out a lot.

03:37.067 --> 03:39.500
So, it's kind of our job
to utilise the resources
of the area.

03:41.467 --> 03:45.067
We gather stuff,
we hunt it down,
and we fish for it.

03:47.067 --> 03:48.267
There's all kinds
of stuff we do.

03:54.367 --> 03:57.200
My wife acquired title
to some properties
that her family has.

04:00.067 --> 04:02.600
The family still uses it,
everybody's still welcome to.

04:03.567 --> 04:05.333
But everybody's done it in
tents, and everybody's done it

04:05.400 --> 04:07.233
with nothing more
permanent than a cache.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.567
And, um, we're gonna do
something more permanent
than a cache down here.

04:17.367 --> 04:18.767
These are the
eight-foot crossbeams.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.767
I see a lot of uses for this,

04:22.833 --> 04:25.600
so I'd like to make this thing
to where it's gonna last
at least a good 10, 20 years.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.800
I never did take a carpentry
class or do anything in those
kind of trades.

04:30.733 --> 04:31.967
All this stuff is self-taught.

04:34.367 --> 04:37.467
If I didn't do this, I'd have
to pay someone, you know,
35, 50 bucks an hour.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.933
This will be able to go from
place to place,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.833
not as, like, a regular sled
with every ride
of a snow machine

04:47.900 --> 04:50.733
but as something that I would
take from one place to another
and leave it there.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.867
I wouldn't play basketball
on this exactly, but, um,

04:54.933 --> 04:57.033
looks like it's definitely
gonna do the job that
I need it to do.

04:57.667 --> 04:58.900
Takes time, but it's coming.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.000
And to tell you the truth,
it's a lot of work.
It's a ton of work.

05:03.533 --> 05:05.000
And this is the time of year
to get it done.

05:10.433 --> 05:12.500
JESSIE: Whenever
you're dealing with
four hours of daylight

05:12.567 --> 05:15.800
and extremely cold
temperatures, tasks tend
to slow down.

05:15.867 --> 05:17.200
The time up here
is everything.

05:22.300 --> 05:23.700

05:23.767 --> 05:25.267
I'm gonna redo
my whole dog yard,

05:25.333 --> 05:27.967
so, got a lot of stuff that
needs to get moved out
of the way,

05:28.033 --> 05:29.400
dogs that need to get moved.

05:30.333 --> 05:31.533
Something that really
needs to happen

05:31.600 --> 05:33.400
so I can get focused
on training here.

05:39.433 --> 05:41.733

05:42.467 --> 05:44.633
Winter racing season
will begin soon,

05:44.700 --> 05:47.933
and getting his dog lot in
working order is a priority.

05:51.233 --> 05:54.867
It's just gonna be
one clean open area
with everything in rows.

05:55.933 --> 05:57.133
It's time to step this up.

06:00.433 --> 06:02.167
The weather has
completely changed.

06:04.067 --> 06:07.033
We're heading
into early winter.
The ground's freezing.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.967
Can't take this top layer
of this ground off

06:09.033 --> 06:10.600
with these stumps out
in the frozen ground,

06:10.667 --> 06:13.100

06:29.667 --> 06:31.233
My friend's
willing to help me right now.

06:31.300 --> 06:33.800
That's huge, because this job
that he's doing for me

06:33.867 --> 06:35.533
is not something that
I could do myself.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.033

of machinery.

06:37.133 --> 06:39.100
(DOGS BARKING)

06:39.167 --> 06:42.200
I've got way too many dogs to
just have dogs strewn all over
the place in the woods,

06:42.267 --> 06:43.400
tripping in holes.

06:44.067 --> 06:45.667
I mean, I'm liable to break
my leg out here

06:45.733 --> 06:48.167
in one of these holes this
winter and end my whole
mushing career.

06:49.900 --> 06:51.900
This has gotta become
professional, organised,

06:51.967 --> 06:53.433
so I can deal with
it efficiently.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.267
To actually be able to see
all my main dogs

07:00.333 --> 07:03.600
that I'm gonna be racing
this year, in one spot,
is gonna be an exciting thing.

07:05.267 --> 07:06.900

long I'm out here,

Time to go moose hunt.

07:33.967 --> 07:35.000
Ammunition.

07:36.300 --> 07:37.867
It's helpful to have
some cord with me.

07:38.933 --> 07:40.533
This is the big hunt
of the year.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.700
When I pull that trigger,
that's six months' food
right there.

07:43.733 --> 07:46.500
And I only get one chance.
A couple weeks here
in the fall. That's it.

07:50.233 --> 07:51.500
It's time to go get a moose.

07:52.333 --> 07:53.833
NARRATOR:
For Glenn Villeneuve,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.667
hunting for moose is his most
critical hunt of the year.

07:57.333 --> 08:01.700
A single moose will provide
Glenn with a six-month
supply of meat and protein,

08:01.767 --> 08:03.633
to help him survive
through dark winter.

08:08.067 --> 08:09.933
GLENN: So I'm heading around
the lake right now hunting,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.067
and what's different this year
from most years is I got snow
on the ground.

08:14.967 --> 08:18.200
I've never hunted moose with
this much snow on the ground
right at the start.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.433
If I had my choice,
I'd probably rather not
have the snow,

08:24.133 --> 08:26.167
just 'cause it makes a lot
of noise walking in it.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.467
Look at this. Just came
upon this moose track.
This is really exciting.

08:35.767 --> 08:39.233
A large moose walked
right through here,
and it wasn't that long ago.

08:40.300 --> 08:42.367
But moose travel fast.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.467
That moose could be
a long ways from here,

08:44.833 --> 08:48.000
but I wanna come around
to the top of this little hill
where I get a better view.

08:51.367 --> 08:52.733
It's good to know
there's a moose around.

08:56.867 --> 08:59.233
(WHISPERING) I'm thinking
about the terrain here,

08:59.300 --> 09:01.733
because one of the biggest
challenges of hunting moose

09:01.800 --> 09:03.600
is getting the moose
back home.

09:07.833 --> 09:11.633
He walked right by here.
Maybe I can get him to turn
around and come back.

09:13.267 --> 09:15.667
I just know I can't keep
moving further away
from the lake.

09:15.733 --> 09:17.400
I have to be very
careful about that.

09:17.767 --> 09:21.033
Right now, I'm already 100
yards from the lake or more,

09:21.100 --> 09:24.433
and if I get any further away,
that's just that much further
I'd have to move this moose.

09:24.667 --> 09:26.267
I haven't heard anything
for several minutes,

09:26.333 --> 09:27.833
I'm gonna try something
a little different.

09:30.333 --> 09:34.167
I'm gonna make a cow call.
See if that interests it.

It's my first day hunting,
so I'm gonna keep moving now,

09:58.967 --> 10:00.900
just look around and see
what else is going on.

10:13.900 --> 10:16.533
(NORMAL VOICE) Walked about
a mile this afternoon,
first day of hunting.

10:16.633 --> 10:19.500
Saw a few squirrel tracks,
one snowshoe hare track,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.333
one moose track.
That's typical.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.767

Right over the hill
there's a big bull.

10:46.367 --> 10:48.767

I can see a big bull
through the trees.

He's outta here,
I can't believe it.

I actually went to pull the
trigger and had the safety on.

11:32.433 --> 11:34.233
That was a nice bull.

Okay, there he is.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.700
(VOCAL MOOSE CALLS)

11:48.433 --> 11:51.433
Nah, he knows
I'm a person now.
There he goes.

11:51.633 --> 11:56.700
A lot of times you just have
a second where you got a clean
shot between two trees,

11:56.967 --> 11:59.867
and I was following him
and he actually came right
between the trees.

11:59.933 --> 12:01.367
I had my safety on.

12:01.567 --> 12:02.867
Really messed up on that one.

12:04.200 --> 12:08.000
It's possible that he'll come
back down in a minute,
but I think he got spooked.

12:08.433 --> 12:09.733
It's important to be patient.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.700
(NORMAL VOICE)
I don't think he's gonna come
back down here tonight,

12:16.767 --> 12:19.033
and I'm not gonna follow him
back further into the woods,

12:19.333 --> 12:22.233
'cause it gets too difficult
to bring him down to the lake
after I kill him.

12:24.067 --> 12:25.867
If it was easy,
it wouldn't be hunting.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.833
I'm gonna get up early
tomorrow first light,
head back out, who knows.

12:31.100 --> 12:34.100
Maybe I'll get a second chance
at that same moose.
Maybe I'll find another one.

JESSIE: I sometimes feel like
this is relentless after
working my butt off,

12:41.867 --> 12:44.400
but then I wake up again
in the morning and I'm just
ready to go.

12:53.067 --> 12:56.433
It's looking amazing
out here, man.
This is like a 180 change.

12:56.500 --> 13:00.033
It was a lot of work getting
this ground all prepped,
you know, took some time.

13:00.367 --> 13:01.400
Totally worth it.

13:02.733 --> 13:05.900
Now I got 50-some-odd posts
to pound for these dogs,

13:05.967 --> 13:08.100
and I gotta do it now,
because ground's freezing.

13:12.533 --> 13:15.733
All right. That's post number
one, right there. That's the
height that I'm looking for.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.533
They're seven-foot posts,
and I'm gonna put 'em
three feet into the ground

13:19.667 --> 13:21.100
with four feet sticking out,
and off of that

13:21.367 --> 13:23.233
will come a swivel that they
can just run in circles.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.933
Then all the dogs
can associate

13:25.000 --> 13:28.100
and I can fit all these
dogs into this area
that I couldn't before.

flowing in the morning.

posts for all my dogs.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.567
setting my dog yard
up like this for years.

14:30.733 --> 14:34.133
So to see it transpire after
being in Alaska for 10 years,

14:34.200 --> 14:36.800
for me it's like a long
steep climb, and like,

14:36.867 --> 14:38.333
I feel like I'm about
to plateau here.

14:39.267 --> 14:41.100

is coming together.

I'm proud of this.

29:00.633 --> 29:02.767
SUE: The me from yesterday
is not the me for tomorrow.

29:02.833 --> 29:04.900
That's a used model.
I'm on the cutting edge.

29:11.233 --> 29:12.833
(MAN SPEAKING ON RADIO)

29:13.567 --> 29:17.333
-Hey, slick. How you doing'?
-(MAN SPEAKING)

29:18.800 --> 29:20.600
All righty, we'll see you
on the ground.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.133
NARRATOR: With her
communications restored,

29:26.300 --> 29:30.600
a plane carrying Sue's winter
fuel supply is finally able
to land at Kavik.

29:38.700 --> 29:42.067
SUE: It is always a relief
to see that the fuel
plane is here.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.433
That's gonna give me
just enough fuel,

29:45.500 --> 29:48.667
if I don't go crazy on it, to
heat my Twinkie this winter.

29:49.467 --> 29:52.333
Hey guys, how you doing?
How many gallons of Jet A
did you get?

29:53.133 --> 29:55.000
PILOT: Uh, 3,200.
SUE: 3,200? All right.

29:55.633 --> 29:57.567
The nice thing about getting
your fuel in winter?

29:57.833 --> 30:01.667
Like everything when
it's cold, it shrinks.
When it's hot, it expands.

30:02.267 --> 30:06.333
I can comfortably fit more
into my bladder in the winter
than I can in the summer.

30:15.267 --> 30:16.267
We're all good here.

30:21.767 --> 30:25.700
The trick with getting
the fuel in, you try not to
order it when you're low.

30:26.033 --> 30:28.167
You don't wait until you're
almost out to order it.

30:28.233 --> 30:30.300
But Mother Nature has had
a lot of other plans.

30:30.433 --> 30:32.667
I've had the fuel on order
for quite a while,

30:32.733 --> 30:38.533
but you know, we've had a good
nine, ten-day stretch of just
non-flyable weather.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.467
This time of year you're
juggling the fates.

30:41.500 --> 30:43.467
I've ratcheted
the amount tight.

30:43.633 --> 30:45.667
I'm working on
limited funds this year.

30:45.733 --> 30:49.833
A lot of financials went out
to get the old bod fixed up,

30:49.967 --> 30:52.067
so it's gonna be
tight this year.

31:00.300 --> 31:01.300
(GRUNTS)

31:09.433 --> 31:10.933
All right.
And that's all we had?

31:11.100 --> 31:12.633
-This is all we had.
-All right.

31:12.700 --> 31:14.733
-If you wanna keep that,
you're welcome to.
-Okay.

31:14.800 --> 31:17.467
Maybe this winter
I'm gonna cut it too close
on heat,

31:17.533 --> 31:19.900
and that's gonna
be the heat I need to
make it an extra night.

31:20.333 --> 31:21.567
Why waste it?

31:22.200 --> 31:25.067
I was not very
profitable this year.
I had a year of healing,

31:25.300 --> 31:27.000
which does not translate
into revenue.

31:27.867 --> 31:30.600
I'll take every single ounce
I paid for and use it.

31:33.367 --> 31:34.667
I've gotta run skint.

31:34.833 --> 31:37.633
I've gotta run a little bit
on the short end of it.

31:37.933 --> 31:40.533
So I may let myself get
a little colder.

31:40.600 --> 31:42.600
I may let myself get
a little darker.

31:42.733 --> 31:46.133
But I have to remain
profitable in order to
have my business,

31:46.200 --> 31:48.267
and I'm not gonna do that by
throwing it away on heat.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.567
All right, guys.
Thank you very much. Yay.

31:53.167 --> 31:54.967
-Thank you very much.
-CO-PILOT: Absolutely.

32:00.900 --> 32:05.167
SUE: It is a relief to know
that there's fuel in.

32:05.233 --> 32:07.400
That I've got 3,200
gallons of jet fuel.

32:09.433 --> 32:13.200
Now I'll go work my numbers
and start calculating out.

32:13.267 --> 32:15.400
I've got 12, 15 months
of planning to do.

32:18.100 --> 32:21.300
Winter is just right up
my backside.
Ton of stuff to do.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.333
CHIP: We're out
in the wilds of nature,

32:29.400 --> 32:30.633
so you never know
what you'll see,

32:30.700 --> 32:32.167
and you don't know it
till you see it.

32:41.400 --> 32:42.767
I'm just fitting the floor on.

32:45.633 --> 32:47.533
I wanna make sure that
it's a good, sturdy sled.

32:48.033 --> 32:50.400
This'll tie it all together.
Give it even more strength.

32:50.767 --> 32:51.933
Then I'm gonna
put some walls on it.

32:52.833 --> 32:54.967
We'll hit it with a roof
and cover it in canvas.

32:56.100 --> 32:59.367
-AGNES: Looking good.
Coming along pretty good.
-Yeah, sure is.

32:59.833 --> 33:02.100
-What you're up to?
-Uh, I need these
to stand up and...

33:03.000 --> 33:05.267
If you wouldn't mind holding
them, that would really help.

33:05.733 --> 33:07.567
Chip's been working
on his tent frame,

33:07.800 --> 33:10.400
and he's really making
a lot of progress.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.067
He's up to the walls, and, uh,

33:13.233 --> 33:16.700
me and Ting are gonna
go check the whitefish net
we put out yesterday.

33:16.767 --> 33:18.567
All right. If you need
anything from me,
let me know.

33:18.633 --> 33:21.467
Yeah. We'll see you later.

33:22.733 --> 33:25.267
NARRATOR: While Chip
completes construction
of the tent frame,

33:25.700 --> 33:30.467
Agnes and Ting take advantage
of the final chance to harvest
fish with a net

33:30.533 --> 33:31.900
before the river freezes.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.533
-I bet there's a lot of fish
in the net today.
-Yeah.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.300
It doesn't look like the river
is freezing, eh? No ice?

33:41.567 --> 33:45.200
So me and Ting are just
heading back out to the net.
We set the net last night.

33:45.500 --> 33:49.333
There's a whole new day,
and we hope there's enough
fish out there, whitefish.

33:52.867 --> 33:54.000
The net's still there!

33:54.600 --> 33:56.600
Hopefully there'll be
quite a few fish in it.

34:04.267 --> 34:06.933
It already looks like there's
quite a few salmon right here,

34:07.000 --> 34:09.467
and there's quite
a few whitefish.

34:11.900 --> 34:13.467
I'm gonna take my driving
jacket off.

34:17.833 --> 34:20.333
Looks like we're gonna be busy
for the rest of the evening.

34:24.633 --> 34:26.433
So this is lots of cold fun.

34:28.700 --> 34:29.800
Oh, look at this.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.667
Got lots of eggs.

34:32.733 --> 34:34.633
I'm kind of glad
the ice went away.

34:34.700 --> 34:38.633
We came back
from our summer camp
and went caribou hunting

34:38.700 --> 34:42.600
and here I am, having another
chance to go out fishing.
I might as well take it.

34:47.300 --> 34:49.067
This is a spawned out salmon.

34:54.067 --> 34:56.767
So what we have here is
a real good catch.

34:56.833 --> 34:59.000
Couple tubs, so, uh,
we're happy.

34:59.067 --> 35:01.033
So now that we got a couple
tote loads of fish,

35:01.100 --> 35:05.300
we're gonna head back home and
go see if Chip needs help with
his, uh, tent frame.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.500
Home, sweet home.

35:12.767 --> 35:14.767
GLENN: It's not the happy
hunting grounds up here.

35:14.833 --> 35:17.600
Game is scarce.
That's the reality
living up here.

35:24.467 --> 35:26.233
Heading back out,
looking for a moose.

35:27.767 --> 35:29.933
Day after day, this takes
a lot of patience.

35:31.133 --> 35:35.300
The lake's already starting
to freeze up in the shallows.
Could pose some problems.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.333
Typically when I kill a moose,

35:39.400 --> 35:42.500
I go back to my camp,
get my canoe, and use
that to get it home.

35:43.633 --> 35:45.400
This year, that could
be a problem.

35:46.933 --> 35:48.467
I'll cross that bridge when
I get to it though.

35:48.533 --> 35:49.767
I gotta find a moose first.

35:56.967 --> 35:58.933

36:03.633 --> 36:05.167
I gotta sound like a moose.

36:16.100 --> 36:20.000
I just came across a moose
track. This probably was
laid down last night.

36:21.133 --> 36:23.833
There's a little bit of snow
that fell into the track.

36:24.667 --> 36:26.500
It was snowing
a little bit last night.

36:27.500 --> 36:33.133
But it's pretty fresh.
When I walk in this track,
it's a long stride.

36:33.200 --> 36:36.033
Look at this track.
This is a big moose track.

36:37.467 --> 36:39.267
I want this moose.

36:40.533 --> 36:43.567
I'm gonna follow this track,
and I'm gonna try to find him.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.600
I got a hunch this moose
might not be too far away.

36:54.233 --> 36:56.033
Look at the length
of that stride.

36:56.100 --> 36:58.167
That's a good-sized animal.

36:59.833 --> 37:02.667
I'm six feet tall,
I got fairly long legs,

37:02.733 --> 37:06.600
and I have a hard
time stepping in this
moose's tracks.

37:06.667 --> 37:07.867
This is a big moose.

37:08.367 --> 37:09.633
I want that moose.

37:50.233 --> 37:51.333
(EXHALES)

37:51.400 --> 37:53.233
I probably walked
about 30 miles

37:53.300 --> 37:55.500
in the last five days
to get this moose.

37:55.967 --> 37:57.833
It was a lot of work walking
around in this snow.

37:59.400 --> 38:00.667
Look at that beautiful moose.

38:02.500 --> 38:05.233
Yeah, he's dead. Look at that.

38:06.500 --> 38:08.100
Six months' meat right there.

38:10.767 --> 38:12.733
First thing I gotta do
is start a fire.

38:14.133 --> 38:15.133
I need some light.

38:18.133 --> 38:20.700
Finding a moose,
getting a shot at it,
killing it,

38:20.767 --> 38:23.167
that's all hard work, but
that's just the beginning.

38:23.233 --> 38:26.667
Now I have to get this moose
cut up and back to my camp.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.100
There we go.

38:40.900 --> 38:44.567
Okay. I got a big animal
here. A lot of weight
to move. (GRUNTS)

38:46.133 --> 38:48.100
It's gonna take a lot of work,
I'm gonna be up all night.

38:49.567 --> 38:50.567
So I gotta get started.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.600
It's a big animal,
and you gotta cut in
just the right place

38:57.667 --> 38:58.733
to get stuff to come apart.

39:03.667 --> 39:06.733

this is a sharp knife.

39:14.367 --> 39:15.667
There.

For me, this is the most
important kill I make
all year long.

39:19.633 --> 39:22.800
One moose like this is enough
meat to last me six months.

39:23.200 --> 39:25.767
That's a lot of food
right here, and it all
paid off tonight.

39:25.867 --> 39:28.333
I was getting a little
concerned, it's getting
late in the season.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.000
There's already snow
all over the ground.

39:30.067 --> 39:31.900
I wasn't sure I was gonna
find a moose this year.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.633
But I did.
And I sure am happy about it.

39:36.900 --> 39:38.333
You know, this
is what it's about.

39:39.433 --> 39:43.300

getting your meat,
getting your food.

39:46.367 --> 39:49.767
There. His ribs... Nice!

39:54.167 --> 39:55.467
Well, I got the moose
all cut up.

that I can move.

it real, and the other part
is, uh, thinking ahead.

going on here.

-You guys catch fish?

40:36.500 --> 40:38.333

AGNES: Salmon.

40:38.400 --> 40:41.233
You get a salmon? How many?
Oh, wow. A big chum.

40:42.500 --> 40:43.833
-(GRUNTS)
-AGNES: Looks like
a pretty good dinner, huh?

40:43.900 --> 40:45.833

excellent if you bake 'em.

40:50.700 --> 40:51.733
Good job!

40:51.800 --> 40:52.867
-CHIP: You think so?
-Yeah.

40:57.067 --> 40:58.833
That's higher than I thought
it was gonna be.

40:58.900 --> 41:01.200
It'll give you storage
space up above. I figure
if we're gonna do this,

41:01.267 --> 41:03.033
we're gonna do it right
the first time,

41:03.100 --> 41:05.933
so I figure the best thing
I can do for you is to make
as much room in here...

41:06.000 --> 41:09.100
-Yeah.
-So I'm thinking right here
is gonna be a big old bed.

41:09.633 --> 41:12.133
There'll be a nice window.

41:12.200 --> 41:15.400
We could even put a window
like over here too.
Put like a table here.

41:15.533 --> 41:17.533
Some shelving,
place to hang our stuff.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.733
Maybe even over here
we could have a sink
or a place to cook,

41:19.900 --> 41:21.267
if you wanna make this
into a cook shack.

41:21.533 --> 41:23.800
And up top of here,
we'll make things for storage.

41:23.867 --> 41:25.167
Looks pretty good to me.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.367
I'm at a point to where I can
do just about anything.

41:27.433 --> 41:29.000
I got up the structure
I wanted to get up.

41:29.233 --> 41:32.233
I'm really lucky that uh,
the freeze-up went away
and it stayed warm.

41:32.300 --> 41:33.600
So I kind of beat
the freeze-up.

41:33.667 --> 41:36.000
The weather gave me a window
and it's pretty nice.

41:37.400 --> 41:40.033
This one will be ready to go
once we got some decent
ice down there,

41:40.100 --> 41:42.200
and before the big snows come
and make it real rough,

41:42.267 --> 41:43.867
we'll be able to take this
right down to camp.

41:43.933 --> 41:45.967
Probably before Christmas.
We could finish her out
down there.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.700
-Sound good?
-Yep.

41:47.967 --> 41:50.400
-Let's go eat some
of your whitefish, huh?
-Yeah.

41:50.467 --> 41:52.000
-Awesome.
-Yeah, that's what I think.

41:52.633 --> 41:53.633
Pretty good work.

CAROL: Wait, is that
a whitefish?
CHIP: Yep.

42:14.100 --> 42:17.000
They're both whitefish,
and they both
have eggs in 'em.

42:20.600 --> 42:24.267
This is our, um, first catch
of the whitefish
with eggs in 'em.

42:26.833 --> 42:28.833
We went and put a net
out yesterday,

42:29.200 --> 42:31.800
and today we checked it, and
now we're having fish dinner.

42:36.933 --> 42:38.000
(ALL LAUGHING)

42:38.933 --> 42:41.200
Well, this here is the end
result of some

42:41.267 --> 42:42.600
pretty good white fishing
if you ask me.

42:42.667 --> 42:44.533
They got, uh,
really nice fish.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.700
But, um, these ladies got to
use a boat and go out
white fishing.

42:48.767 --> 42:49.867
Usually this time of year,

42:49.933 --> 42:51.500
there'd be ice
out on the river,

42:51.800 --> 42:54.733
so thawing out helped me out.
I got to go out here
and have an easy build,

42:55.500 --> 42:57.500
and my wife got to go out
and have an easy net set

42:57.567 --> 42:59.133
and an easy net check.

42:59.433 --> 43:02.000
I think I saved a considerable
amount of time by assembling
the frame here.

43:03.833 --> 43:04.967
It's been pretty good so far.

43:05.033 --> 43:06.500
We'll just see how it keeps
chugging along.
