00:51.289 --> 00:52.855
- Mum.
- Mm-hm?

00:52.857 --> 00:54.757
Can you play
three and in with me?

00:54.759 --> 00:55.759
Sure, honey.

00:55.761 --> 00:57.126
- Bags...
- Bags not in goal first!

00:57.128 --> 00:58.230
You monkey, come on.

00:59.497 --> 01:00.299
Let's go.

01:04.703 --> 01:07.270
Brady to Hoolihan, to
Hoolihan back to Brady.

01:07.272 --> 01:08.641
It crosses to Shane Long!

01:13.212 --> 01:15.011
Mommy, you're phone's ringing.

01:15.013 --> 01:15.981
It's okay, honey.

01:22.521 --> 01:23.285
Ooh.

01:23.287 --> 01:24.186
Yeah!

01:24.188 --> 01:25.625
It's three-nil and
the crowd goes wild!

01:27.992 --> 01:29.695
It's your turn in goals, mister.

01:30.662 --> 01:31.496
Now.

01:41.105 --> 01:42.441
I'll be back in a second, honey.

01:42.775 --> 01:43.509
Okay.

01:48.079 --> 01:49.979
What do you want?

01:50.715 --> 01:51.981
Kevin!

02:07.132 --> 02:09.002
No!

02:15.973 --> 02:18.642
If you ever want to
see your son again,

02:18.644 --> 02:21.078
I suggest you talk
to your prick ex

02:21.080 --> 02:23.046
and not your pig friends.

02:23.048 --> 02:24.182
You understand?

02:25.417 --> 02:27.420
If you even...

02:29.020 --> 02:30.387
You'll what?

03:25.043 --> 03:26.445
Kevin.

03:43.794 --> 03:44.729
Amanda.

03:45.097 --> 03:46.199
What did you do?

03:48.567 --> 03:49.569
I'm sorry.

03:50.435 --> 03:51.570
I'm so sorry.

03:52.604 --> 03:53.473
Get off me.

03:56.275 --> 03:57.374
What have you done?

03:57.376 --> 03:58.444
Amanda!

03:58.811 --> 04:01.814
Please, let me talk.

04:06.717 --> 04:07.786
Go on.

04:09.621 --> 04:10.790
Talk.

04:19.898 --> 04:22.535
Those Russian pricks who
I put away five years ago,

04:24.468 --> 04:25.471
they got out last week.

04:25.704 --> 04:26.870
Last week?

04:26.872 --> 04:28.238
And you ring me this morning?

04:28.240 --> 04:30.307
You piece of shit,
they've taken my son!

04:30.309 --> 04:32.274
-Our son, Amanda.

04:32.276 --> 04:33.743
He's my son, too.

04:33.745 --> 04:34.644
You're no father.

04:34.646 --> 04:36.146
-You never let me be one.

04:36.148 --> 04:37.583
Just finish your story.

04:39.283 --> 04:41.817
They want the 600 grand
they say I owe them

04:41.819 --> 04:43.156
or they're gonna kill me.

04:43.456 --> 04:45.154
You asshole.

04:45.156 --> 04:46.755
You should've gone to
jail just like them

04:46.757 --> 04:49.495
but you didn't because
you're a piece of shit rat.

04:49.694 --> 04:50.993
He was a cop.

04:50.995 --> 04:52.262
It's his job to put them away.

04:52.264 --> 04:54.432
You're a cop, too, you
should understand that.

04:54.833 --> 04:56.068
He was a cop.

04:57.002 --> 04:58.702
Didn't he tell you
why he isn't anymore?

04:58.704 --> 05:00.803
He wanted to spend more
time with you and Kevin

05:00.805 --> 05:02.372
so he quit, but you left him.

05:02.374 --> 05:03.843
You cut him outta your life.

05:04.242 --> 05:06.843
I know he's your brother
and you love him,

05:06.845 --> 05:07.947
but he is a liar.

05:12.451 --> 05:13.216
I gave evidence.

05:13.218 --> 05:14.284
Gave?

05:14.286 --> 05:16.086
You sold narcotics, 600,000...

05:16.088 --> 05:17.456
14.

05:18.923 --> 05:19.891
Sam...

05:22.293 --> 05:23.926
I sold drugs that were
scheduled to be destroyed

05:23.928 --> 05:25.363
to an Eastern Bloc gang.

05:26.665 --> 05:29.466
Then I set up the
operation that caught them,

05:29.468 --> 05:31.938
seized back the drugs,
and kept the money.

05:32.204 --> 05:34.137
The only problem
is he got caught.

05:34.139 --> 05:35.639
You didn't have to cut me
outta Kevin's life, though.

05:35.641 --> 05:36.906
Yes I did!

05:36.908 --> 05:39.608
I did it for us, so we
could have a better...

05:39.610 --> 05:40.610
-Enough!

05:41.980 --> 05:43.616
I am sick of it.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.449
What are we doing here
dredging up a past

05:46.451 --> 05:48.153
that you're still
in denial over?

05:49.687 --> 05:52.490
What are we going to
do to get <i>our</i> son back?

05:53.824 --> 05:54.961
What's your plan now?

05:58.997 --> 05:59.831
Who's that?

06:06.237 --> 06:07.139
That's our plan.

06:33.264 --> 06:34.464
Put on the kettle
there, love, will ya?

06:34.466 --> 06:36.166
What's he doing here?

06:36.168 --> 06:37.433
- I'll leave if ya
want. It's not my kid

06:37.435 --> 06:39.168
- that's gone missing.
- No!

06:39.170 --> 06:40.005
We need him.

06:43.774 --> 06:44.973
Hey.

06:44.975 --> 06:46.377
Why are you here?

06:46.379 --> 06:48.945
Helping me little
sister of course.

06:52.317 --> 06:53.683
We'll sort this, okay?

06:53.685 --> 06:54.519
Yeah.

06:55.754 --> 06:57.456
So what's this
fuckin' plan, then?

07:02.427 --> 07:04.426
Okay, it's very
simple really.

07:04.428 --> 07:07.130
You can't go to the cops and
you don't have the money.

07:07.132 --> 07:08.397
So you've only one option.

07:08.399 --> 07:09.399
You're gonna have to steal it.

07:09.401 --> 07:12.469
We're gonna steal
600,000 Euro?

07:12.471 --> 07:13.603
No.

07:13.605 --> 07:14.837
We're gonna steal six million.

07:14.839 --> 07:15.805
Six million?

07:15.807 --> 07:17.807
Are you outta your fuckin' mind?

07:17.809 --> 07:19.007
No, I'm not.

07:19.009 --> 07:20.510
Okay, this is a
terrible situation.

07:20.512 --> 07:22.077
Why can't we get something
out of it for ourselves?

07:22.079 --> 07:24.250
Jack, you said
you'd help me.

07:25.884 --> 07:27.851
And I said
it'd cost you.

07:27.853 --> 07:29.618
I'm sorry, buddy, but you're
not the most reliable,

07:29.620 --> 07:31.620
so I'm takin' my cut
from the source, okay?

07:31.622 --> 07:34.060
What do you need
5.4 million for?

07:34.392 --> 07:36.760
You ever been on a
peacekeeping mission?

07:36.762 --> 07:38.995
Fuckers takin'
potshots at ya all day?

07:38.997 --> 07:40.366
Ya have take it like a sap?

07:40.999 --> 07:43.332
We're not even
allowed to shoot back.

07:43.334 --> 07:45.403
Pay is shit and the retirement
package is even shitter.

07:45.603 --> 07:47.673
You don't need 5.4
million, though.

07:48.673 --> 07:50.173
What do you think
I am, a monster?

07:50.175 --> 07:52.308
I only want one million.

07:52.310 --> 07:54.110
And you want one million,
and you want one million,

07:54.112 --> 07:56.478
and you want one
million, and you...

07:56.480 --> 07:58.281
-I don't want money.

07:58.283 --> 07:59.617
I want my son back.

07:59.850 --> 08:01.817
We're not doing this
for a fucking cut.

08:01.819 --> 08:02.587
Why not?

08:03.422 --> 08:05.120
There's five of us.

08:05.122 --> 08:06.188
Why six million?

08:06.190 --> 08:07.824
Because you're gonna
give a cool one million

08:07.826 --> 08:09.993
to those Eastern Bloc cunts
to make absolutely certain

08:09.995 --> 08:11.226
that don't hurt your
kid and leave you

08:11.228 --> 08:13.298
the fuck alone for the
rest of your lives.

08:15.600 --> 08:16.435
Okay.

08:19.137 --> 08:20.069
Okay.

08:20.071 --> 08:21.874
Method to me madness, buddy.

08:22.074 --> 08:23.072
But robbin' more than we need

08:23.074 --> 08:24.308
only makes things more risky.

08:24.310 --> 08:25.474
How?

08:25.476 --> 08:27.310
We're robbin' the place anyway.

08:27.312 --> 08:29.411
We get caught, we're going
to jail and your kid is dead.

08:29.413 --> 08:30.248
Game over.

08:31.615 --> 08:35.083
What's the difference between
600,000 and 6 million?

08:35.086 --> 08:37.352
Just a couple of extra
duffle bags, that's all.

08:37.355 --> 08:38.724
The risk is the same.

08:39.024 --> 08:40.225
So we don't get caught then.

08:40.725 --> 08:41.860
What place?

08:42.659 --> 08:43.727
The Bank of Albernia.

08:44.796 --> 08:46.463
You're kidding.

08:46.465 --> 08:48.230
Your plan is to hold up
the bank where you work

08:48.232 --> 08:49.799
as a security officer?

08:49.801 --> 08:51.367
Did you hit your
head or something?

08:51.369 --> 08:52.904
They'll recognize
you a mile away.

08:53.639 --> 08:55.070
We're not holdin'
up the bank itself,

08:55.072 --> 08:57.409
just the CEO, Philip
Pindar, and his family.

08:57.743 --> 08:58.744
A tiger kidnapping.

08:59.076 --> 08:59.943
A what?

08:59.945 --> 09:00.810
It's when...

09:00.812 --> 09:02.978
It's a victimless
crime, okay kid?

09:02.980 --> 09:04.980
We break into the house,
secure the family as hostages,

09:04.982 --> 09:06.483
bring Daddy to the
bank to get the cash,

09:06.485 --> 09:07.916
bring him back,
reunite him with Mommy

09:07.918 --> 09:09.889
and the darlin' children,
everyone's happy.

09:10.188 --> 09:12.855
The money's insured so even
the bank aren't out of pocket.

09:12.857 --> 09:14.556
The family don't even have
to leave their living room.

09:14.558 --> 09:16.626
They can <i>Netflix and
chill</i> for all I care.

09:16.628 --> 09:17.830
No one will get hurt.

09:19.197 --> 09:20.629
Worst case scenario, they'll
have a few nightmares.

09:20.631 --> 09:22.434
And frankly, fuck them.

09:22.668 --> 09:24.166
Pindar's an
elitist prick.

09:24.168 --> 09:26.603
He looks down his
nose at everyone.

09:26.605 --> 09:28.240
His family are
probably the same.

09:29.640 --> 09:32.642
You do realize that our
son was taken hostage,

09:32.644 --> 09:33.877
and your plan to get him back

09:33.879 --> 09:35.380
is to take another
family hostage?

09:36.148 --> 09:38.451
Where's Alanis Morissette
when you need her, huh?

09:39.417 --> 09:40.552
I know it sounds bad,

09:41.620 --> 09:43.486
- but it's...
- A victimless crime.

09:43.488 --> 09:44.857
A few bad nightmares.

10:15.452 --> 10:16.822
Drink?

10:17.154 --> 10:19.188
Any chance you get, eh?

10:19.190 --> 10:21.357
Another reason why I left you.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.293
Sober my ass.

10:34.371 --> 10:35.604
So the money needs
to be handed over

10:35.606 --> 10:37.108
within the next 48 hours.

10:38.109 --> 10:40.343
Jack is workin' out
the last few details,

10:40.345 --> 10:42.411
but the plan is pretty simple.

10:42.413 --> 10:43.883
We all have our roles, so...

10:46.384 --> 10:47.686
So who's doing what?

10:51.889 --> 10:53.292
You'll do background
checks on the target.

10:55.994 --> 10:57.493
<i>This guy is
super rich so we expect</i>

10:57.495 --> 10:58.730
<i>top of the line security.</i>

11:00.631 --> 11:02.165
<i>Any direct
alarm or camera links</i>

11:02.167 --> 11:03.836
<i>need to be shut
down ahead of time.</i>

11:06.270 --> 11:07.837
We're lucky this family live
in the middle of nowhere

11:07.839 --> 11:11.040
<i>so we expect the police to
be pretty thin on the ground,</i>

11:11.042 --> 11:13.876
but just in case, I'll
need you to monitor rosters

11:13.878 --> 11:16.778
<i>and patrol movements,
anything and everything</i>

11:16.780 --> 11:18.082
that might be useful.

11:30.195 --> 11:32.328
Jack is on equipment detail.

11:32.330 --> 11:33.732
Of course he is.

11:37.369 --> 11:39.301
<i>What sort of equipment?</i>

11:39.303 --> 11:41.771
<i>Guns, vests,
clothes, restraints,</i>

11:41.773 --> 11:43.839
<i>anything he thinks that will
make us look more authentic.</i>

11:43.841 --> 11:45.241
Where's he gonna
get all of that?

11:46.410 --> 11:47.712
Jack, what
are you doing up there?

11:47.979 --> 11:50.014
This is Jack we're
talkin' about here.

11:51.349 --> 11:53.319
I'm just lookin' at
me old comics, Ma.

11:54.219 --> 11:55.120
Put the kettle on, will ya?

11:58.255 --> 12:00.656
<i>I presume Neville's
our fly on the wall.</i>

12:00.658 --> 12:02.824
<i>He's opened the door
for this guy for years.</i>

12:02.826 --> 12:04.362
<i>He's familiar with his routine.</i>

12:05.529 --> 12:07.664
<i>With a bit of luck,
he should be able</i>

12:07.666 --> 12:09.065
<i>to check Pindar's
schedule so he can</i>

12:09.067 --> 12:11.733
<i>anticipate his movements
tomorrow evening.</i>

12:27.751 --> 12:31.554
Hey ya.

12:31.556 --> 12:33.055
Okay, so Neville will
have done his bit.

12:33.057 --> 12:34.891
We don't need him
on the mission.

12:34.893 --> 12:36.228
You try tellin' him that.

12:39.297 --> 12:40.563
What about Sam?

12:40.565 --> 12:41.367
He's just a kid.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.098
He's not a kid anymore.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.102
He's our wheel man.

12:50.140 --> 12:51.843
<i>We need a clean vehicle that
won't link back to us.</i>

12:52.711 --> 12:55.313
You're getting your little
brother to steal cars?

12:55.947 --> 12:57.847
<i>He's been robbin'
cars since he was 12.</i>

12:57.849 --> 12:58.951
He knows the risks.

13:00.751 --> 13:01.983
If we get into
trouble on the road,

13:01.985 --> 13:04.252
no amount of donut
spins are gonna help us.

13:08.592 --> 13:10.526
<i>Sam's the best driver I know.</i>

13:10.528 --> 13:13.161
<i>I feel safer knowin' he
was gettin' us from A to B,</i>

13:13.163 --> 13:14.863
and helpin' us get our son back.

13:22.173 --> 13:24.009
So what's your role
in all of this?

13:25.643 --> 13:27.877
I'm the one who's gonna
bring Pindar to the bank,

13:27.879 --> 13:30.213
get the money,
make the exchange,

13:30.215 --> 13:32.418
and bring Kevin back safely.

13:33.618 --> 13:35.320
Do you think I'm gonna
leave that up to you?

15:28.533 --> 15:29.802
How was school?

15:30.067 --> 15:31.166
It was good.

15:31.168 --> 15:32.471
We learned about World War II.

15:32.770 --> 15:35.537
Ah, we should talk
about that later.

15:35.539 --> 15:37.473
I might have some
insights for you.

15:37.475 --> 15:39.812
Like what you told
me about Newgrange?

15:40.812 --> 15:41.647
Exactly.

15:43.014 --> 15:45.817
Daddy, is all history different
to what the teachers say?

15:46.750 --> 15:47.552
Some of it.

15:47.919 --> 15:49.387
Why do I have to learn it, then?

15:50.054 --> 15:52.588
Because that's what
people believe.

15:52.590 --> 15:53.625
But it's not true.

15:54.692 --> 15:57.059
It's as true as it needs to be.

15:57.061 --> 15:58.493
You understand why.

15:58.495 --> 16:00.832
To maintain
order, to maintain power.

16:01.298 --> 16:02.134
Exactly.

16:04.936 --> 16:06.271
Come on, dinner time.

16:34.899 --> 16:35.734
Philip.

16:37.034 --> 16:37.870
Sarah.

16:39.336 --> 16:40.672
How was your day?

16:41.940 --> 16:42.975
Satisfactory.

16:45.109 --> 16:46.177
Dinner smells good.

16:47.544 --> 16:49.247
It's just leftovers.

16:51.883 --> 16:54.382
I'll try to pick up
something fresh tomorrow.

16:54.384 --> 16:57.686
Carl, honey, will you go
get your sister, please?

16:57.688 --> 16:59.220
I'll get her.

16:59.222 --> 17:01.894
Carl, help your
mother with the table.

17:44.801 --> 17:46.602
Dad.

17:46.604 --> 17:47.572
You scared the crap out of me.

17:47.939 --> 17:50.905
Since when did
you scare so easy?

17:50.907 --> 17:53.042
Tonight's a big night
for me, remember?

17:53.044 --> 17:54.209
I'm a little anxious.

17:54.211 --> 17:57.712
Ah, my little
girl, all grown up.

17:57.714 --> 17:59.882
Yeah well, not grown up enough
to make my own decisions

17:59.884 --> 18:01.883
about who I hook
up with apparently.

18:01.885 --> 18:04.019
He's from good stock, and please

18:04.021 --> 18:05.921
don't refer to it as hooking up.

18:05.923 --> 18:06.625
We're better than that.

18:06.825 --> 18:07.659
Whatever.

18:08.593 --> 18:09.525
Your dinner's ready.

18:09.527 --> 18:10.726
I'm not hungry.

18:10.728 --> 18:12.965
You have to eat,
especially tonight.

18:14.932 --> 18:15.968
Claire.

18:16.300 --> 18:18.035
Fine, down in a minute.

19:01.711 --> 19:03.711
What are you wearing?

19:03.713 --> 19:05.047
A smokin' hot dress.

19:05.049 --> 19:06.882
You are not wearing that.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.517
It's on me right now.

19:08.519 --> 19:10.689
I literally couldn't
be more wearing it.

19:11.923 --> 19:14.026
It's not appropriate
for tonight.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.794
You get to pick the boy,
I get to pick the dress.

19:25.135 --> 19:26.471
Are we expecting guests?

19:27.038 --> 19:28.039
No.

21:32.663 --> 21:33.498
Boo.

21:40.337 --> 21:41.205
Nobody move.

21:43.007 --> 21:44.743
And drop the butter knife.

21:47.678 --> 21:48.580
Move.

22:01.057 --> 22:03.459
Is that really necessary?

22:03.461 --> 22:05.329
Yes, it is, asshole.

22:07.198 --> 22:08.099
There's no need.

22:09.767 --> 22:11.299
Here.

22:11.301 --> 22:12.469
Go play with your game.

22:15.940 --> 22:17.538
Weird kid.

22:17.540 --> 22:19.211
Anything goes
wrong, it's on you.

22:25.249 --> 22:26.084
We're secure.

22:27.084 --> 22:27.986
Bring in the Jeep.

22:42.165 --> 22:43.465
Are you all right, love?

22:43.467 --> 22:44.400
Yeah.

22:44.402 --> 22:45.503
Kind of have plans for tonight.

22:46.002 --> 22:48.336
Ah, so do we, love.

22:48.338 --> 22:50.104
It'll be
all right, Claire.

22:50.106 --> 22:51.108
We'll work something out.

22:51.308 --> 22:53.343
So, what's for dinner?

22:53.345 --> 22:54.446
You wouldn't like it.

23:07.090 --> 23:09.760
Everyone, listen up.

23:11.461 --> 23:15.666
Nobody will get hurt if
you do exactly what we say.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.605
This, as you may have guessed,
is a tiger kidnapping.

23:23.039 --> 23:24.773
You've more than likely been
prepped for such an event

23:24.775 --> 23:29.781
by your employer, but just
in case, let me explain.

23:31.615 --> 23:34.549
Myself and my associate here,

23:34.551 --> 23:36.485
will take you to the
bank where you will make

23:36.487 --> 23:39.388
a massive withdrawal of money.

23:39.390 --> 23:42.560
My friends will stay and
keep your family company.

23:43.993 --> 23:46.394
Should we not return
within two hours,

23:46.396 --> 23:48.896
should I not answer
their phone calls,

23:48.898 --> 23:53.869
should they even see a
hint of cops or deception,

23:53.871 --> 23:57.773
they will not hesitate
to seriously ruin

23:57.775 --> 23:59.511
your fucking evening.

24:06.182 --> 24:07.018
Fine.

24:07.984 --> 24:09.153
I'll get you the money.

24:09.988 --> 24:12.921
I'll do whatever you want as
long as my family are unharmed.

24:12.923 --> 24:13.822
Philip.

24:13.824 --> 24:15.356
Sarah, I have to.

24:15.358 --> 24:19.260
You stay here, stay calm,
and everything will be okay.

24:19.262 --> 24:20.064
I promise.

24:22.266 --> 24:23.768
Daddy, don't go.

24:25.502 --> 24:28.603
Hey, Mommy and Claire
need you to be strong

24:28.605 --> 24:30.706
and to protect them, okay?

24:30.708 --> 24:32.177
These people only want money.

24:33.376 --> 24:34.910
The sooner I go, the
sooner I'll be back,

24:34.912 --> 24:37.449
and the sooner I can read
you a bedtime story, okay?

24:38.481 --> 24:39.216
Okay.

24:39.916 --> 24:40.751
Okay.

24:43.921 --> 24:44.756
All right.

24:45.990 --> 24:46.857
Let's get this over with.

24:47.391 --> 24:48.222
Dad.

24:48.224 --> 24:49.290
It's all right, Claire.

24:49.292 --> 24:50.127
You heard him.

24:51.595 --> 24:54.598
This will all be over soon,
so just sit quiet and wait.

24:57.535 --> 24:58.370
You ready?

24:59.369 --> 25:01.171
We can't all go.

25:04.174 --> 25:05.106
I don't remember you

25:05.108 --> 25:06.677
being involved in planning this.

25:07.845 --> 25:10.746
I don't wanna
mess with your plan,

25:10.748 --> 25:12.484
but I can't go in your Jeep.

25:13.651 --> 25:15.217
If I arrive in a
strange vehicle,

25:15.219 --> 25:17.221
security will know
something is up.

25:18.489 --> 25:20.858
It's already strange me
arriving so late at night.

25:26.763 --> 25:27.731
We should take my car.

25:29.232 --> 25:30.402
It's a two seater.

25:30.734 --> 25:33.538
It's a very
nice two seater.

25:36.105 --> 25:37.375
And I should drive.

25:38.776 --> 25:41.312
And you should crouch
in the passenger seat.

25:43.747 --> 25:47.982
I want your plan to
work just as much as you do.

25:47.984 --> 25:49.286
The money's insured.

25:50.153 --> 25:51.955
My family are my priority.

25:57.728 --> 25:58.759
I'm goin' alone.

25:58.761 --> 26:00.130
That wasn't the plan.

26:00.431 --> 26:01.266
It is now.

26:13.943 --> 26:15.113
Try not to let anyone get hurt.

26:16.446 --> 26:18.015
You don't have to tell me.

26:42.306 --> 26:43.441
Dibs drive on the way back.

27:17.641 --> 27:18.543
Well this is dull.

27:19.542 --> 27:20.510
Quiet, Claire.

27:20.810 --> 27:23.378
What? I have to miss one of
the biggest nights of my life

27:23.380 --> 27:25.683
because a bunch of peasants
aren't happy with their dole?

27:26.250 --> 27:27.451
What is it, your debs?

27:28.618 --> 27:29.853
Trust me, you're
not missin' much.

27:30.186 --> 27:32.754
Let me guess,
you spent your debs

27:32.756 --> 27:36.224
in some dinge hole nightclub
fending off drunken jocks?

27:36.226 --> 27:38.259
I had slightly
classier plans, thanks.

27:38.261 --> 27:39.029
Claire.

27:39.296 --> 27:41.966
Only talking, trying
to break the ice.

27:49.440 --> 27:50.307
Hey you.

27:51.275 --> 27:52.110
Yeah you.

27:53.176 --> 27:54.776
You keep lookin' at the ground.

27:54.778 --> 27:56.777
What's wrong?

27:56.779 --> 27:59.884
You don't like what
ya see?

28:02.118 --> 28:04.355
Or maybe ya like it a
little bit too much.

28:08.459 --> 28:10.691
Ya stink of cheap
deodorant, so I'm guessing

28:10.693 --> 28:12.661
you're the baby of the bunch.

28:12.663 --> 28:13.894
What are ya, like 16?

28:13.896 --> 28:15.663
I'm 22, actually.

28:15.665 --> 28:17.164
Shut the fuck up, dickhead.

28:17.166 --> 28:18.734
You wanna tell her your
name and address as well?

28:18.736 --> 28:20.071
And you shut the fuck up, too.

28:20.304 --> 28:21.469
Make me.

28:24.907 --> 28:27.808
I'm not jokin' around
here, princess.

28:27.810 --> 28:30.180
Now shut the fuck up!

28:31.214 --> 28:32.049
Hey!

28:32.583 --> 28:34.181
You've made your point.

28:34.183 --> 28:36.051
Please leave her alone,
she'll stop talking.

28:36.053 --> 28:37.753
Honey, won't you,
you'll stop talking?

28:37.755 --> 28:39.187
Fine.

28:39.189 --> 28:40.221
Sorry princess.

28:41.557 --> 28:43.158
Couldn't hear you over
that loud dress.

28:43.160 --> 28:44.262
I said I'll shut up.

28:48.265 --> 28:49.765
Good girl.

28:49.767 --> 28:50.934
Fuckin' idiot.

29:15.625 --> 29:16.293
Yeah?

29:17.227 --> 29:18.794
We have the package.

29:18.796 --> 29:22.200
I repeat, we have the
package and it is glorious!

29:22.532 --> 29:24.266
He took the full amount?

29:24.268 --> 29:26.067
<i>It was just
like he said, just a case</i>

29:26.069 --> 29:27.739
of a couple of
extra duffle bags.

29:30.307 --> 29:31.840
<i>Relax.</i>

29:31.842 --> 29:33.344
Everything is goin' to plan.

29:35.112 --> 29:36.644
Okay, okay.

29:36.646 --> 29:37.978
What's your ETA?

29:37.980 --> 29:39.847
We're makin' good time.

29:39.849 --> 29:42.686
Approximately... 45 minutes.

29:43.653 --> 29:45.222
This is all gonna
be over soon, babe.

29:46.656 --> 29:47.759
Don't get ahead of yourself.

29:52.195 --> 29:54.464
Well done, sir, well done!

29:56.165 --> 29:58.769
In less than an hour,
this'll all be over.

30:02.772 --> 30:04.739
They're on their way back.

30:04.741 --> 30:05.976
So just sit tight.

30:06.176 --> 30:07.944
Mommy, I need to
go to the bathroom.

30:08.178 --> 30:09.443
Daddy'll be home
soon, ya little shit,

30:09.445 --> 30:11.014
then you can go for a piss.

30:11.815 --> 30:13.284
But I need to go now.

30:14.284 --> 30:15.219
Can I take him?

30:17.788 --> 30:19.187
No.

30:19.189 --> 30:20.391
One of us will take him.

30:22.859 --> 30:23.694
Be quick.

30:26.497 --> 30:28.700
Carl, I'll take ya to
the bathroom, all right.

30:29.700 --> 30:31.365
There's no need to
be scared, buddy.

30:31.367 --> 30:33.704
Sure I'm just a silly
fella with a big nose.

30:33.971 --> 30:34.771
Pinocchio?

30:35.038 --> 30:35.970
Exactly.

30:35.972 --> 30:37.040
Ya like Pinocchio?

30:37.273 --> 30:38.075
No.

30:40.243 --> 30:43.213
Right, well come
on then, let's go.

30:44.314 --> 30:45.216
I'll be right back.

31:11.075 --> 31:13.141
Did you hear something?

31:13.143 --> 31:14.746
Stay there.

31:54.684 --> 31:55.784
What is it?

31:57.520 --> 31:59.257
Nothin'.

31:59.923 --> 32:00.590
It's fine.

32:24.213 --> 32:25.316
Ok, come on in.

32:26.316 --> 32:27.184
I'll be outside.

32:31.922 --> 32:34.791
It's ok, kid.
I'm not going anywhere.

32:39.096 --> 32:40.828
Fuck!

32:40.830 --> 32:41.698
Sit the fuck down.

32:41.898 --> 32:43.733
- But Carl...
- Sit the fuck down!

32:44.634 --> 32:45.302
I'll check him.

32:47.471 --> 32:49.105
Hey, hold it
together, will ya?

32:58.448 --> 32:59.150
Nev...

32:59.517 --> 33:00.684
P... Pinocchio?

33:32.548 --> 33:33.384
Carl!

35:03.907 --> 35:04.742
Carl?

35:11.414 --> 35:12.382
Carl!

35:28.998 --> 35:30.197
What's going on?
What's happened to Carl?

35:30.199 --> 35:31.099
Sit.
I said sit down.

35:31.101 --> 35:33.101
What's
happened to my son?

35:33.103 --> 35:33.967
Sit down, sit down.

35:33.969 --> 35:35.271
- Where is he?
- Sit.

35:39.876 --> 35:40.611
What?

35:41.344 --> 35:43.446
There's someone
else in this house.

35:44.047 --> 35:45.416
What you talkin' about?

35:46.416 --> 35:49.586
Neville is dead and
Carl is missing.

35:51.688 --> 35:52.523
Jesus Christ.

35:52.989 --> 35:54.255
What's going on?

35:54.257 --> 35:55.255
Where is my son?

35:55.257 --> 35:56.891
Will you sit the fuck down!

35:56.893 --> 35:58.293
Hey!

35:58.295 --> 35:59.296
She's his mother!

36:05.135 --> 36:08.806
Sarah, we will find
your son, I promise.

36:10.206 --> 36:12.941
If anything happens to my son,

36:12.943 --> 36:16.213
it's your fault, so help me God.

36:16.545 --> 36:18.545
Ring that prick,
find out where he is.

36:24.887 --> 36:26.222
Why the fuck isn't he answering?

36:26.722 --> 36:29.092
I don't know.

36:30.927 --> 36:33.795
Okay, we'll split up.

36:33.797 --> 36:37.365
You, watch her, and
you, you come with us

36:37.367 --> 36:38.499
and we'll find him together.

36:38.501 --> 36:39.733
She's a fuckin' hostage.

36:39.735 --> 36:42.306
You remember why
we're here, right?

36:44.373 --> 36:45.874
He's scared.

36:45.876 --> 36:47.578
We need her to find him.

36:48.612 --> 36:49.677
This is fucked.

36:49.679 --> 36:51.146
What's goin' on?

36:51.148 --> 36:51.979
Where's Neville.

36:51.981 --> 36:53.284
Just stay focused.

36:56.085 --> 36:59.186
Sarah, does Carl have
any hiding places,

36:59.188 --> 37:00.688
somewhere that he feels safe.

37:00.690 --> 37:02.760
He sometimes plays in his
wardrobe in his bedroom.

37:03.059 --> 37:03.893
Okay.

37:05.228 --> 37:06.063
Let's go.

37:09.231 --> 37:11.568
Don't make this any more
complicated than it is.

37:35.458 --> 37:36.293
Come on.

37:40.931 --> 37:43.467
For what it's worth,
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

37:44.201 --> 37:45.034
I know.

37:56.012 --> 37:58.315
Carl's bedroom's
at the end of the corridor.

38:04.820 --> 38:06.723
Is that the bathroom?

38:21.403 --> 38:22.806
Where's the body?

38:29.813 --> 38:30.847
Was he dead or what?

38:31.181 --> 38:33.516
Yes, he was fucking dead.

38:37.320 --> 38:38.756
This is fucked.

38:41.291 --> 38:42.557
Now she's gone.

38:42.559 --> 38:43.994
Sarah.

38:57.541 --> 39:02.809
You know, tonight was meant
to be a big night for me.

39:02.811 --> 39:05.012
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:05.014 --> 39:07.050
Why else do you think
I'm all dressed up?

39:09.418 --> 39:12.522
Tonight was the night that
I was meant to meet 'the one'.

39:13.523 --> 39:15.726
I guess that's not
gonna happen now, is it?

39:16.126 --> 39:19.327
Come on, he's probably
still out there somewhere.

39:19.329 --> 39:21.798
No, it's all about
timing with me.

39:23.365 --> 39:24.467
It had to be tonight.

39:41.251 --> 39:42.416
Where the hell are you?

39:42.418 --> 39:44.552
What? Were
you ringing me?

39:44.554 --> 39:45.956
The signal is shite down here.

39:46.822 --> 39:48.391
How far away are you?

39:49.326 --> 39:50.661
About 30 minutes.

39:52.695 --> 39:53.529
Hello?

39:54.731 --> 39:55.499
Well, what's goin' on?

39:56.398 --> 39:58.167
We're not the only ones here.

39:58.867 --> 40:01.871
What are you talkin' about?

40:05.407 --> 40:06.509
Neville is dead.

40:13.115 --> 40:13.951
How?

40:15.150 --> 40:17.320
I don't know, we're
trying to find out.

40:19.121 --> 40:20.657
Did someone else have
the same idea as us?

40:21.458 --> 40:22.393
<i>I don't know.</i>

40:23.693 --> 40:27.695
And the boy, he was
with Neville, too,

40:27.697 --> 40:30.000
when it happened and
now he's missing.

40:35.237 --> 40:37.307
We're trying to find
him with his mother,

40:38.541 --> 40:39.876
and now she's missing, too.

40:41.244 --> 40:42.880
I'll be there as fast as I can.

40:57.994 --> 40:59.659
What was all that about?

40:59.661 --> 41:01.461
Nothin'.

41:01.463 --> 41:02.298
Everything's fine.

41:04.300 --> 41:05.936
I'm glad to hear it.

41:11.206 --> 41:14.143
Don't get us killed
driving so fast.

41:43.206 --> 41:44.375
I'm sorry.

41:45.375 --> 41:47.077
Hey, it's okay.

41:49.846 --> 41:51.914
You're very gentle.

41:55.751 --> 41:57.755
These ties are hurting me.

41:59.021 --> 41:59.822
Sorry.

42:02.291 --> 42:04.258
Can you take them off?

42:04.260 --> 42:08.031
No, no I can't.

42:12.402 --> 42:13.670
But I'm scared.

42:15.070 --> 42:18.342
Come on, love, I'm
gonna protect you.

42:25.081 --> 42:27.317
I'd be very appreciative.

42:30.052 --> 42:30.887
Promise.

42:47.003 --> 42:48.005
No, don't.

42:51.106 --> 42:51.909
Kinky.

43:23.273 --> 43:25.742
We should stop, this is crazy.

44:06.949 --> 44:07.783
Carl.

44:57.266 --> 44:58.101
What?

44:59.702 --> 45:02.737
You got your money,
and you promised me

45:02.739 --> 45:05.242
my family would be
unharmed if I cooperated.

45:06.842 --> 45:08.778
Is there something
you need to tell me?

45:10.045 --> 45:11.181
Carl, are you here?

45:12.815 --> 45:15.184
Somethin' happened,
but it's under control.

45:16.085 --> 45:17.387
Are my family safe?

45:18.253 --> 45:19.389
Come on.

45:20.623 --> 45:21.724
<i>They're fine.</i>

45:22.958 --> 45:24.293
<i>And your people?</i>

45:25.327 --> 45:27.663
<i>It's under control.</i>

45:29.465 --> 45:31.201
I'm not sure Neville
would agree with you.

45:35.438 --> 45:36.306
How did you know that?

45:38.173 --> 45:40.641
I must confess, I
recognized his stench

45:40.643 --> 45:42.179
as soon as he entered my home.

45:43.346 --> 45:44.614
What are you talkin' about?

45:48.317 --> 45:50.920
You think you are the
hunters and we are the prey.

45:51.887 --> 45:52.722
No.

45:53.922 --> 45:55.024
No, no, no.

45:56.992 --> 46:00.894
You are the poor, weak,
soft, defenseless prey

46:00.896 --> 46:04.835
and we are the hunters,
the top of the pyramid,

46:06.436 --> 46:08.038
the top of the food chain.

46:11.775 --> 46:12.706
What the fuck?

46:29.826 --> 46:30.793
Come on, let's
get out of here.

46:31.226 --> 46:32.596
We can't leave him.

46:33.329 --> 46:34.662
What do you mean?

46:34.664 --> 46:35.966
He's my brother.

46:37.666 --> 46:38.969
He's all of our brother.

46:40.603 --> 46:41.802
This is a unit we don't know

46:41.804 --> 46:43.369
what we're up against, okay?

46:43.371 --> 46:46.643
So we have to go before whoever
done this does it to us.

46:51.547 --> 46:54.682
We need to find
Sarah and the boy.

46:54.684 --> 46:56.887
We need to protect them
and make this right.

46:57.853 --> 46:59.722
We need to survive, come on.

47:11.199 --> 47:12.968
Yeah, yeah, keep going.

47:14.003 --> 47:15.536
Yeah.

47:15.538 --> 47:18.141
Keep going.

47:24.547 --> 47:26.148
You done too, Foxy?

47:27.849 --> 47:28.684
Come on.

47:29.818 --> 47:31.054
Come on.

47:31.253 --> 47:32.086
Come on.

47:32.088 --> 47:33.423
Stop, please.

47:40.496 --> 47:41.896
Where have you been?

47:41.898 --> 47:43.700
We've been looking
for you and Carl.

47:45.333 --> 47:48.672
Well I'm
here, and he's there.

47:56.411 --> 47:57.443
You okay, kid?

48:08.023 --> 48:08.688
Oy!

48:12.327 --> 48:13.396
Let's go, go!

48:39.822 --> 48:41.856
Stop!

48:43.326 --> 48:44.260
The fuck?

48:45.427 --> 48:47.193
Oops.

48:47.195 --> 48:49.496
Lost myself in the moment.

49:03.112 --> 49:04.280
Too much, Foxy?

49:32.307 --> 49:33.840
What can I say?

49:33.842 --> 49:36.245
I just love creamy hot meat.

49:42.318 --> 49:44.050
We need to get out of here.

49:44.052 --> 49:44.985
You can't go that way.

49:44.987 --> 49:45.920
Claire's some sort of monster.

49:45.922 --> 49:46.822
Ya think?

49:50.826 --> 49:51.994
Fuck, it's locked.

49:53.128 --> 49:54.028
In here.

51:36.132 --> 51:37.300
What are you doin'?

51:37.932 --> 51:39.735
Do you think these
matter anymore?

51:40.802 --> 51:41.637
Yeah, fuck it.

51:43.304 --> 51:45.841
Couldn't breathe in the
fuckin' thing anyway.

51:49.811 --> 51:51.080
Where's your Kevlar?

51:51.380 --> 51:53.215
The freak ripped it off me.

51:55.483 --> 51:56.952
They look so normal.

52:05.827 --> 52:06.963
I take that back.

52:07.996 --> 52:09.298
What are they, vampires?

52:10.432 --> 52:13.103
Ah, great, they're
fuckin' lizard people.

52:15.170 --> 52:15.971
You're jokin', right?

52:16.338 --> 52:19.072
And the joke's on us. And
our whole fuckin' species.

52:19.074 --> 52:21.008
I knew those Illuminati
fucks were real.

52:21.010 --> 52:22.278
Oh, this is fucked up.

52:22.644 --> 52:26.215
Still though, mommy lizard,
even without the hair...

52:27.782 --> 52:29.318
We need to get out of here.

52:30.585 --> 52:31.353
What about Rick?

52:31.686 --> 52:33.822
Ring him and tell
him not to come back.

52:37.760 --> 52:38.862
Please answer.

52:41.530 --> 52:43.533
Fuck.

52:43.798 --> 52:45.701
Hopefully daddy lizard
is still playing along.

52:46.101 --> 52:47.034
We need to warn him.

52:47.036 --> 52:48.068
Call the police.

52:48.070 --> 52:49.036
No.

52:49.038 --> 52:50.704
I don't care about
goin' to jail.

52:50.706 --> 52:53.373
I doubt the local pigs are
gonna take us seriously anyway.

52:53.375 --> 52:55.641
Ah, hello guard, yeah,
we're being chased

52:55.643 --> 52:57.144
by a bunch of
fuckin' reptilians.

52:57.146 --> 52:58.715
You wouldn't come down
and have a word, would ya?

52:59.014 --> 53:00.380
The last time I was
talking to Rick,

53:00.382 --> 53:02.249
he said he'd be 30 minutes.

53:02.251 --> 53:04.251
Which means he should
be here in the next 20.

53:04.253 --> 53:06.052
Okay, so we sit here
and wait it out.

53:06.054 --> 53:08.354
Or we take the Jeep and
meet him on the road.

53:08.356 --> 53:09.492
Option two it is.

53:10.492 --> 53:11.960
You lost your gun, too?

53:12.795 --> 53:13.695
And your hoodie.

53:19.969 --> 53:21.834
Seriously.

53:21.836 --> 53:23.373
Fuck it, who am I to judge?

53:26.074 --> 53:27.508
I already put one
in the bitch mother

53:27.510 --> 53:28.941
and she shrugged it off.

53:28.943 --> 53:30.744
You see any of those
reptilian fucks,

53:30.746 --> 53:33.746
you empty the entire clip
right into their faces.

53:33.748 --> 53:35.048
Head shots or go home.

53:35.050 --> 53:36.419
That includes the kid.

53:36.619 --> 53:38.385
Now hold on.

53:38.387 --> 53:40.420
Whatever he is, he
is still a child.

53:40.422 --> 53:41.688
We broke into his home.

53:41.690 --> 53:43.891
We're the aggressors here.

53:43.893 --> 53:46.459
I was willing to so this
as a victimless crime

53:46.461 --> 53:49.396
to get my son back,
not to become a monster

53:49.398 --> 53:50.100
and take someone else's.

53:50.599 --> 53:52.432
A monster?

53:52.434 --> 53:55.269
That little shit ripped
your brother's throat out.

53:55.271 --> 53:56.339
Neville's dead?

53:59.208 --> 54:00.440
No matter what you
think of me, Amanda,

54:00.442 --> 54:02.378
I'm the only one who's
seen combat here.

54:03.277 --> 54:06.445
Make no mistake about it,
tonight we face death.

54:06.447 --> 54:07.750
It's kill or be killed.

54:09.652 --> 54:12.119
One problem, Jeep's
in the courtyard.

54:12.121 --> 54:13.789
The other end of the
house through the kitchen.

54:14.222 --> 54:14.958
Okay.

54:15.791 --> 54:17.758
We go out the window,
straight across the front

54:17.760 --> 54:19.626
of the house under the
arch into the courtyard

54:19.628 --> 54:21.561
the way you drove
in, and then you do

54:21.563 --> 54:24.466
what you do best and you get
us the fuck outta here fast.

54:24.867 --> 54:25.768
Now that I can do.

54:27.202 --> 54:28.137
Let's go.

54:49.559 --> 54:50.894
Okay go, move.

54:53.762 --> 54:54.827
Whoa!

54:54.829 --> 54:55.829
Back, back, back!

55:07.710 --> 55:08.610
This way.

55:25.628 --> 55:27.063
Let's go.

55:41.844 --> 55:43.579
Up or down?

55:44.380 --> 55:47.014
Well, unless yous have a
good supply of pixie dust,

55:47.016 --> 55:48.081
I think being stuck at the top

55:48.083 --> 55:49.586
of a tower is a terrible idea.

55:50.652 --> 55:51.486
Down.

56:26.521 --> 56:27.356
You ok?

57:23.378 --> 57:24.813
What the fuck?

57:25.914 --> 57:26.749
The dinner.

57:29.885 --> 57:31.587
The food under the lids.

57:53.509 --> 57:55.744
Chilled human, fuck me.

57:56.811 --> 57:58.347
And we're fresh meat.

57:58.581 --> 58:01.651
You still wonderin'
who the monsters are?

58:02.650 --> 58:03.485
Come on.

59:19.360 --> 59:20.596
Motherfucker!

59:25.166 --> 59:25.902
What do we do now?

59:26.101 --> 59:28.103
Same plan, back to the Jeep.

59:28.403 --> 59:29.635
What about Sam?

59:29.637 --> 59:32.072
I might be a cunt, but
I'm not a fuckin' cunt.

59:32.074 --> 59:32.942
Then why the Jeep?

59:33.175 --> 59:34.106
Backup.

59:34.108 --> 59:35.110
Backup?

59:36.777 --> 59:39.114
I just emptied me
last fucking clip.

59:46.320 --> 59:48.123
I'd rather you
waste them than me.

01:00:06.909 --> 01:00:07.777
Go, move.

01:00:26.827 --> 01:00:27.663
Fuck.

01:00:29.097 --> 01:00:29.932
Go, fuck.

01:01:29.023 --> 01:01:29.858
Jesus.

01:01:30.958 --> 01:01:32.561
What do we need
all that for?

01:01:32.994 --> 01:01:35.897
Let's just say I'm an
enthusiast with a touch of OCD.

01:01:39.266 --> 01:01:40.335
Can you smell that?

01:01:46.141 --> 01:01:47.507
Run!

01:03:10.291 --> 01:03:11.960
Lookin' a bit worse
for wear, lad.

01:03:13.894 --> 01:03:16.862
This is a long shot,
but I'm lookin'

01:03:16.864 --> 01:03:19.065
for a man who might've
come through here.

01:03:19.067 --> 01:03:22.871
Fancy suit, probably a
bit banged up like me.

01:03:24.706 --> 01:03:26.442
He's waitin' for
you by the fire,

01:03:27.708 --> 01:03:29.110
but he's not a bit like you.

01:03:30.746 --> 01:03:31.579
What?

01:03:32.748 --> 01:03:34.817
Mr. Pindar is waiting
for you by the fire.

01:03:38.954 --> 01:03:40.256
Compliments of Mr. Pindar.

01:03:43.858 --> 01:03:47.697
My advice, don't
keep him waiting.

01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:12.922
Ah, Rick.

01:04:14.188 --> 01:04:16.188
I'm relieved to see you're okay.

01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:18.458
You were unconscious
and I got a bit bored

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:21.427
waiting for you to wake
up, so I thought I'd pop

01:04:21.429 --> 01:04:24.967
in here for a quick drink
before I headed home for dinner.

01:04:26.101 --> 01:04:26.936
What are you?

01:04:27.735 --> 01:04:31.336
You know,
that's a very fine whiskey

01:04:31.338 --> 01:04:32.107
you're not drinking.

01:04:34.675 --> 01:04:35.510
What's in it?

01:04:36.577 --> 01:04:37.846
Oh please.

01:04:39.146 --> 01:04:41.583
If I wanted to kill you
I wouldn't poison you.

01:04:42.884 --> 01:04:44.019
Spoils the meat.

01:04:48.356 --> 01:04:50.526
That's a 100 year-old scotch,

01:04:51.425 --> 01:04:53.959
blended especially for
George V to celebrate...

01:04:53.961 --> 01:04:55.097
I'm more of a
Jimmy man, me self.

01:04:56.097 --> 01:04:58.534
Well, you're only human.

01:04:58.766 --> 01:05:00.168
And I don't drink anymore.

01:05:06.407 --> 01:05:07.242
Mm.

01:05:09.143 --> 01:05:13.679
So, Rick, to get back to your
overly simplistic question,

01:05:13.681 --> 01:05:18.686
I am, or I should say <i>we</i>
are, the natural order.

01:05:21.889 --> 01:05:24.527
Tonight you stumbled upon
something that few ever do.

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:47.615
Help!

01:05:50.518 --> 01:05:51.353
Help!

01:06:02.898 --> 01:06:06.434
<i>My people have been
around since the dawn of time.</i>

01:06:08.702 --> 01:06:10.038
<i>We existed before man.</i>

01:06:11.472 --> 01:06:15.208
<i>We are the true master race.
Strong, fast, intelligent,</i>

01:06:16.644 --> 01:06:19.248
<i>perfectly adapted
for any environment.</i>

01:06:49.277 --> 01:06:52.114
If we have a flaw, it's
our biological clocks.

01:06:53.815 --> 01:06:56.652
Our females only have a
brief window for conception.

01:06:57.318 --> 01:06:58.454
Fuckin' women, eh?

01:07:08.262 --> 01:07:09.230
Please let me go.

01:07:09.498 --> 01:07:11.331
<i>This flaw,
however, is really evolution</i>

01:07:11.333 --> 01:07:15.133
at its most balanced.
Natural population control

01:07:15.135 --> 01:07:16.639
for the top of the food chain.

01:07:19.641 --> 01:07:21.510
We are the true
heirs to this planet.

01:07:23.411 --> 01:07:28.150
We thrived and we built cities
like you couldn't imagine,

01:07:29.951 --> 01:07:34.354
but after a rather well-known
extinction level event,

01:07:34.356 --> 01:07:36.555
when we were at our weakest,

01:07:36.557 --> 01:07:41.262
your kind fell from the trees
and multiplied like a virus.

01:07:42.264 --> 01:07:44.833
Suddenly there were more of
you than there were of us,

01:07:45.934 --> 01:07:48.637
but what we lacked in numbers
we made up for in intellect.

01:07:49.737 --> 01:07:52.271
So we orchestrated our
disappearance from this world

01:07:52.273 --> 01:07:54.740
and from your history.

01:07:54.742 --> 01:07:59.213
Now all that's left are
fragments in your mythologies,

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:04.452
along with the ravings of
wild-eyed conspiracy theorists.

01:08:06.454 --> 01:08:10.923
<i>Funnily enough, we do have
one thing in common: biology.</i>

01:08:10.925 --> 01:08:14.059
<i>Like us, you're blessed
with the limbic neocortex,</i>

01:08:14.061 --> 01:08:16.127
<i>otherwise known as
the reptile brain</i>

01:08:17.363 --> 01:08:21.067
<i>that controls instinct,
dominance, aggression.</i>

01:08:22.304 --> 01:08:24.504
It's the part of you that
stops you from getting killed

01:08:24.506 --> 01:08:26.942
like the overgrown
lemmings that you are.

01:08:29.010 --> 01:08:30.977
<i>But while our species
evolved in harmony</i>

01:08:30.979 --> 01:08:34.647
<i>with these qualities, yours
evolved in conflict with them,</i>

01:08:36.082 --> 01:08:40.255
favoring irrational emotions
like empathy and love.

01:08:42.055 --> 01:08:43.559
<i>And what good did it do you?</i>

01:08:44.957 --> 01:08:46.862
<i>Today we rule your whole world.</i>

01:08:48.162 --> 01:08:51.363
<i>We control your governments,
your corporations,</i>

01:08:51.365 --> 01:08:54.399
<i>your monarchies, your
secret societies,</i>

01:08:54.402 --> 01:08:57.269
<i>your law enforcement,
and the cornerstone</i>

01:08:57.270 --> 01:09:00.009
<i>of it all, your banks.</i>

01:09:02.377 --> 01:09:03.308
Oh.

01:09:07.314 --> 01:09:08.216
He's in the tower.

01:09:09.317 --> 01:09:10.982
Oh fuckin' Jesus.

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:14.856
Okay.

01:09:16.323 --> 01:09:19.524
<i>But if I'm honest
with you, all this protocol</i>

01:09:19.527 --> 01:09:22.430
<i>and etiquette can
be quite wearisome.</i>

01:09:23.363 --> 01:09:25.531
Frankly, I was delighted
to see you and your friends

01:09:25.533 --> 01:09:27.136
darken my door this evening.

01:09:28.536 --> 01:09:31.470
You see, pretending to
be human for so long

01:09:31.471 --> 01:09:34.542
can make us forget who
and what we really are.

01:09:35.609 --> 01:09:36.875
You've made an otherwise

01:09:36.877 --> 01:09:40.112
dull night very interesting.

01:10:03.171 --> 01:10:05.170
If there was one minor
gripe I have with you,

01:10:05.172 --> 01:10:07.576
it's that you ruined my
daughter's courtship.

01:10:07.841 --> 01:10:09.545
My sincerest apologies.

01:10:10.545 --> 01:10:13.044
Oh, it's quite all right really.

01:10:13.046 --> 01:10:15.714
The young man she was bestowed
to was from a fine bloodline

01:10:15.716 --> 01:10:20.721
but as an individual he
was quite the posh twat.

01:10:23.292 --> 01:10:27.994
Besides, I'm sure she's
found a young virile male

01:10:27.996 --> 01:10:29.629
among your group by now.

01:10:31.533 --> 01:10:33.331
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:10:33.333 --> 01:10:35.300
Is that any way to speak

01:10:35.302 --> 01:10:36.939
to the mother of your child?

01:10:39.207 --> 01:10:40.109
How would that work?

01:10:40.908 --> 01:10:43.041
Oh, our two species can breed.

01:10:43.043 --> 01:10:44.309
In fact, there are so few of us

01:10:44.311 --> 01:10:46.478
that we find it
necessary to do so

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:50.385
from time to time, just to
broaden out the gene pool.

01:10:51.452 --> 01:10:52.684
You're not pregnant.

01:10:52.686 --> 01:10:55.756
Not yet, but I will be.

01:10:57.324 --> 01:10:59.692
How the hell does my brother
bangin' your daughter

01:10:59.694 --> 01:11:00.863
make things interesting for you?

01:11:02.863 --> 01:11:04.532
That's not what's
interesting, Rick.

01:11:04.865 --> 01:11:08.804
And then
I'm gonna eat you all up.

01:11:09.404 --> 01:11:12.241
Please, just stop!

01:11:14.042 --> 01:11:16.044
Have you ever been
game hunting, Rick?

01:11:18.212 --> 01:11:20.278
You appreciate the
meat so much more

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.947
when you kill it yourself.

01:11:53.847 --> 01:11:56.885
<i>Anyway, I really
must get going.</i>

01:11:58.519 --> 01:12:00.518
I don't want my family
to have all the fun.

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.322
Please.

01:12:02.289 --> 01:12:03.225
Please let them go.

01:12:04.259 --> 01:12:06.157
We didn't mean you any harm.

01:12:06.159 --> 01:12:07.729
It was meant to be
a victimless crime.

01:12:22.377 --> 01:12:24.977
I'm sorry, it's just, I like

01:12:24.979 --> 01:12:27.446
to tenderize my
meat before I eat.

01:12:28.216 --> 01:12:30.219
Eat this.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:33.588
Fuck.

01:12:34.323 --> 01:12:36.158
No crime is
victimless, Rick.

01:12:36.591 --> 01:12:40.459
You need to learn to be
responsible for your actions.

01:12:40.461 --> 01:12:43.963
It's your fault you got involved
with these drug dealers,

01:12:43.965 --> 01:12:46.065
got caught, ruined your career,

01:12:46.067 --> 01:12:47.836
and that they
kidnapped your child.

01:12:49.237 --> 01:12:52.173
For a man so concerned
with people's well-being,

01:12:53.373 --> 01:12:55.409
<i>you have an awful lot
of blood on your hands.</i>

01:12:59.814 --> 01:13:01.147
Thanks.

01:13:01.149 --> 01:13:02.551
Head shots or go home.

01:13:09.323 --> 01:13:11.824
How did you know all that?

01:13:11.826 --> 01:13:13.261
Only a few people knew.

01:13:13.828 --> 01:13:15.396
Another one of our gifts, Rick.

01:13:16.264 --> 01:13:17.932
You can't hide anything from me.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.666
Just count yourself lucky.

01:13:21.668 --> 01:13:22.503
I like you.

01:13:23.371 --> 01:13:24.472
You amuse me.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:29.077
So, I've decided I'm
not going to kill you.

01:13:30.243 --> 01:13:31.544
I'm going to teach you

01:13:31.546 --> 01:13:34.850
the greatest lesson of
all: Responsibility.

01:13:36.951 --> 01:13:38.517
You alone will survive tonight

01:13:38.519 --> 01:13:40.389
and all your
friends will perish.

01:13:41.622 --> 01:13:45.827
You can keep the money you
took, pay off your drug dealers

01:13:46.894 --> 01:13:49.131
and live with the
consequences of your actions.

01:13:51.032 --> 01:13:54.235
After all, the money is insured.

01:13:55.569 --> 01:13:57.572
A victimless crime.

01:14:13.287 --> 01:14:16.722
Gentlemen, I would
greatly appreciate it

01:14:16.724 --> 01:14:18.391
if you could show
my acquaintance

01:14:18.393 --> 01:14:21.163
Rick here some hospitality.

01:14:24.364 --> 01:14:27.366
This will cover everyone's
tab for the evening.

01:14:27.368 --> 01:14:31.807
Breakages and the
usual discretion.

01:14:53.493 --> 01:14:54.395
Alright, lads.

01:14:58.432 --> 01:15:00.499
Get off me, you farmer prick.

01:15:25.993 --> 01:15:28.160
I think he's finished, lads.

01:15:39.105 --> 01:15:39.940
Keys.

01:15:41.908 --> 01:15:43.509
Somebody give me some
fucking car keys now

01:15:43.511 --> 01:15:45.881
or you'll be pourin' your
own drinks from now on.

01:15:52.854 --> 01:15:54.786
If you are goin' back up there,

01:15:54.788 --> 01:15:56.157
make sure you finish it.

01:15:57.591 --> 01:15:59.760
This village has
suffered enough.

01:16:09.871 --> 01:16:11.736
Why don't you do
something yourselves?

01:16:11.738 --> 01:16:14.772
This is how it's been
around here for generations.

01:16:14.774 --> 01:16:17.041
We dare not disobey them.

01:16:17.043 --> 01:16:18.947
We dare not anger them.

01:17:17.805 --> 01:17:19.474
Get away from him!

01:17:21.042 --> 01:17:21.877
Sam.

01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:24.712
Stay down.

01:17:54.375 --> 01:17:55.441
Hold still, kid.

01:17:55.443 --> 01:17:56.608
Oh Jesus.

01:18:11.926 --> 01:18:14.429
You killed
my baby!

01:18:20.801 --> 01:18:21.736
Hurry up!

01:18:22.569 --> 01:18:25.403
Gotcha, bitch.

01:18:27.207 --> 01:18:28.473
No!

01:18:32.313 --> 01:18:33.782
Jack!

01:19:06.046 --> 01:19:06.880
Sam.

01:19:21.761 --> 01:19:22.596
Amanda!

01:20:05.672 --> 01:20:11.246
Amanda!

01:20:19.286 --> 01:20:20.619
Jack.

01:20:20.621 --> 01:20:21.553
Where is she?

01:20:21.555 --> 01:20:22.653
I don't know.

01:20:33.868 --> 01:20:36.201
You killed
my child.

01:20:36.203 --> 01:20:38.070
You killed the
life inside of me.

01:20:39.038 --> 01:20:40.007
I killed your baby!

01:20:40.274 --> 01:20:41.242
I killed your baby!

01:20:42.243 --> 01:20:44.009
I killed your little cunt freak!

01:20:44.011 --> 01:20:44.843
I did it!

01:20:46.113 --> 01:20:48.213
I killed your freak,
I'm the one you want!

01:20:48.215 --> 01:20:50.616
Drop the gun.

01:20:55.055 --> 01:20:56.990
Please.

01:21:46.806 --> 01:21:48.076
You're scared.

01:21:50.543 --> 01:21:52.313
Ready when you are, princess.

01:21:55.114 --> 01:21:55.916
Don't!

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.210
You're
very brave.

01:22:24.811 --> 01:22:26.510
Fuckin' bitch!

01:22:26.512 --> 01:22:27.979
Defiant.

01:22:31.018 --> 01:22:31.853
Strong.

01:22:33.319 --> 01:22:37.356
Perhaps I picked the wrong
man to father my child.

01:22:37.358 --> 01:22:39.260
You definitely
picked the wrong guy.

01:22:58.679 --> 01:23:00.914
Put the kettle on, love.

01:23:10.256 --> 01:23:11.091
Jesus.

01:23:15.695 --> 01:23:16.430
Jack...

01:23:18.698 --> 01:23:20.999
Go get your boy.

01:23:21.001 --> 01:23:22.537
Finish the mission.

01:23:22.970 --> 01:23:25.039
I thought you didn't
care about my son.

01:23:26.907 --> 01:23:27.976
I always cared.

01:23:33.247 --> 01:23:35.850
I just wished he was... mine.

01:23:37.984 --> 01:23:38.819
Ours.

01:23:43.157 --> 01:23:44.425
I thought you hated me.

01:23:48.228 --> 01:23:49.463
I love you.

01:23:51.597 --> 01:23:52.766
I always have.

01:23:56.737 --> 01:23:57.672
Amanda...

01:24:02.342 --> 01:24:04.045
Rick still loves you.

01:24:24.965 --> 01:24:25.766
Sam.

01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:37.211
Sam!

01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:41.983
Can you walk?

01:24:43.783 --> 01:24:44.952
I can run.

01:24:59.932 --> 01:25:01.935
Thank God,
this must be Rick.

01:25:03.436 --> 01:25:05.238
It's just them in
a different car.

01:25:09.342 --> 01:25:11.345
I can't see the driver.

01:25:15.314 --> 01:25:16.714
Oh shit.

01:25:16.716 --> 01:25:17.551
Go.

01:25:31.731 --> 01:25:33.430
Fuck, he's
gonna rip us apart.

01:25:33.432 --> 01:25:34.532
No.

01:26:09.103 --> 01:26:09.936
Sam?

01:26:11.971 --> 01:26:13.437
What about Rick?

01:26:15.609 --> 01:26:16.811
Rick left with Philip.

01:26:19.179 --> 01:26:20.847
He didn't come back.

01:26:24.518 --> 01:26:25.353
Come on.

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:48.576
Fuck!

01:26:53.846 --> 01:26:55.347
No, don't!

01:27:13.766 --> 01:27:15.836
You killed my family.

01:27:17.237 --> 01:27:18.605
You killed mine first.

01:27:24.177 --> 01:27:27.044
You think your brother
and that gang of misfits

01:27:27.046 --> 01:27:29.649
is any way equal to my dynasty?

01:27:43.229 --> 01:27:44.428
Run!

01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:45.265
Hide!

01:27:46.132 --> 01:27:49.237
Drown in the fear of the
agony that is coming for you.

01:28:26.305 --> 01:28:27.474
Where's Sam?

01:28:32.746 --> 01:28:33.581
Jack?

01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:52.365
He's not dead.

01:28:55.769 --> 01:28:56.934
This one's for Neville.

01:29:01.007 --> 01:29:02.741
This one's for Jack.

01:29:04.810 --> 01:29:05.679
In the head!

01:29:06.846 --> 01:29:08.679
And this one's for
me brother Sam.

01:29:25.131 --> 01:29:27.134
Now you both will die.

01:30:40.439 --> 01:30:42.676
And you think
we're the monsters.

01:34:15.421 --> 01:34:16.589
We're done now, yeah?

01:34:17.256 --> 01:34:18.192
Maybe.

01:34:18.692 --> 01:34:19.726
Maybe not.

01:34:20.659 --> 01:34:23.660
Trust me, we're fuckin' done.
