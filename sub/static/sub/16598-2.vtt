00:02.436 --> 00:05.039
ANGELA:
There's something
inside my house.

00:05.073 --> 00:06.807
And it's trying
to take my daughter.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.077
You know what's
going on here, right?

00:09.110 --> 00:13.013
I liked my friend's stupid
Wiccan craft store on Facebook.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.215
She's very worried
about you.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.383
KAT:
She's losing her mind.

00:15.416 --> 00:16.417
(wall rattling)
Mom?

00:17.385 --> 00:18.352
Hey, hon.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.820
TOMAS:
How's the boat, Henry?

00:19.853 --> 00:21.222
The boat.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.256
Did you fix it up?

00:22.290 --> 00:23.391
You're wasting your time.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.193
He's basically a potato.
ANGELA: Kat!

00:25.226 --> 00:27.428
Since when do you have Jessica
writing you letters?

00:27.461 --> 00:29.497
Why are you even talking to her?
She's my friend.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.431
She's married.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.599
Gabriel?

00:31.632 --> 00:32.933
(howling)

00:32.966 --> 00:34.335
Please, God. Please, God.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.436
Oh, God.

00:35.469 --> 00:36.770
The church has places for those

00:36.804 --> 00:38.606
who would disobey
a direct order.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.108
MARCUS:
You putting me out
to pasture, Bennett?

00:40.141 --> 00:41.242
BENNETT:
If my hand is forced.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.111
TOMAS:
Father Marcus,

00:43.144 --> 00:44.612
what can you tell me about
demonic possession?

00:44.645 --> 00:46.547
Go home,
Father Tomas.

00:46.580 --> 00:47.948
Live a long and happy life.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.250
You're way out of your depth.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.251
(thud, girl screams)

00:50.284 --> 00:51.385
Katherine?

00:51.419 --> 00:52.786
Casey?

00:52.820 --> 00:54.222
(grunting)
Father?

00:54.255 --> 00:55.323
Hey, Mom.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.463
*

01:02.496 --> 01:05.499
(demonic voice
speaking faintly)

01:08.269 --> 01:10.271
(demonic voice roaring faintly)

01:11.805 --> 01:14.742
FATHER SEAN:
You have no family.

01:14.775 --> 01:18.379
No future to speak of.

01:18.412 --> 01:22.650
The world don't know who
you are and doesn't care.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.818
(faint screaming)

01:24.852 --> 01:28.389
Today, we find out if

01:28.422 --> 01:30.824
any of you lads
are something more.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.127
(door opens, closes)

01:33.161 --> 01:35.996
(whimpering softly)

01:36.029 --> 01:38.666
I-I'm sorry,
Father Sean.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.337
(retching, spitting)

01:45.373 --> 01:47.508
You.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.543
(demonic voice growling faintly)

02:13.066 --> 02:15.068
(door creaking)

02:18.739 --> 02:21.209
(demonic voice growling faintly)

02:21.242 --> 02:22.976
(door closes)

02:28.416 --> 02:30.384
(demonic voice growling)

02:30.418 --> 02:32.420
(chains rattling)

02:46.166 --> 02:48.135
(demonic voice growling)

02:48.168 --> 02:50.170
(chains rattling)

03:00.113 --> 03:01.782
(quiet whoosh)

03:04.385 --> 03:05.786
(demonic voice roaring)

03:07.855 --> 03:10.424
(demonic voice): Lupus in
fabula, venit enim ad me.

03:10.458 --> 03:13.561
Lupus in fabula,
venit enim ad me.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.764
"Ask and it will
be given to you.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.766
"Seek and you will find.
(growling)

03:21.802 --> 03:22.670
(growling)

03:22.703 --> 03:24.104
"Resist the Devil,

03:24.137 --> 03:25.773
"and he will run
away from you.

03:25.806 --> 03:29.777
The nearer you go to God,
the nearer He will come to you."

03:29.810 --> 03:30.878
(roaring)

03:30.911 --> 03:32.913
(bus engine running)

03:41.889 --> 03:43.090
(electronic chime)

03:43.123 --> 03:44.458
DRIVER:
Stop coming up.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.026
Harrison Street.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.795
Downtown Chicago.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.900
(footsteps)

03:54.435 --> 03:56.770
(stairs creaking)

04:13.020 --> 04:14.455
(demonic voice):
So...

04:14.488 --> 04:16.490
fresh.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.460
(exhales sharply)

04:19.493 --> 04:22.129
Casey?

04:22.162 --> 04:24.565
So wonderfully...

04:24.598 --> 04:25.666
(gasps)

04:25.699 --> 04:26.800
...supple.

04:28.201 --> 04:29.202
(tablet beeps)

04:56.296 --> 04:59.266
(Angela panting)

04:59.299 --> 05:01.001
Casey?

05:01.034 --> 05:02.002
Baby?

05:02.035 --> 05:04.004
She's watching you, you know.

05:06.006 --> 05:11.278
Your lying, sneaking mother.

05:11.311 --> 05:15.182
She's right beside you.

05:15.215 --> 05:18.586
So it's time that you wake...

05:20.588 --> 05:21.589
...wake up!

05:23.357 --> 05:25.359
(panting)

05:28.429 --> 05:30.230
Casey?

05:30.263 --> 05:32.199
(normal voice):
Mom?

05:34.201 --> 05:35.703
(breath shudders)

05:35.736 --> 05:37.705
*

06:09.403 --> 06:12.339
(rap music playing
over headphones)

06:12.372 --> 06:14.408
* Something sinister to it

06:14.442 --> 06:17.344
* Pendulum swinging slow,
a degenerate moving *

06:17.377 --> 06:19.279
* Through the city
with criminal stealth *

06:19.312 --> 06:20.448
* Welcome to enemy turf

06:20.481 --> 06:22.282
* Harder than immigrants work

06:22.315 --> 06:23.917
* "Golf" is stitched
into my shirt *

06:23.951 --> 06:25.385
* Get up off the pavement

06:25.419 --> 06:27.555
* Brush the dirt
up off my psyche *

06:27.588 --> 06:29.857
* Psyche, psyche...

06:29.890 --> 06:31.859
EGAN:
Is the girl aware

06:31.892 --> 06:35.262
of the changes in herself?

06:35.295 --> 06:37.264
I sat down with Casey
after what happened

06:37.297 --> 06:39.366
in the attic last week.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.401
She doesn't remember.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.437
How about the family?
What do they think?

06:43.471 --> 06:46.707
The mother,
she's very concerned.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.141
She came to me for help.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.644
The-the father and sister,
they don't know.

06:50.678 --> 06:53.581
The father is recovering
from a brain injury.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.915
It's a bad time.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.851
I told the mother
to gather evidence.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.389
Today she sent me this.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.592
A video of the girl
talking to herself.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.995
(demonic voice):
She's watching you, you know.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.663
Your lying...

07:09.697 --> 07:11.999
This is the kind of proof
we'll need for approval.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.468
Approval for what?

07:14.502 --> 07:16.637
An exorcism.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.640
We dropped you
in a dying parish,

07:19.673 --> 07:21.942
and you made good.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.411
You have something--

07:24.444 --> 07:27.581
an approachability and that
thick head of hair of yours.

07:27.615 --> 07:32.620
This Homeless to Houses program
you started is marvelous.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.755
We should replicate it
in every parish.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.857
This-this girl, this family...
You've been noticed.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.892
You've been noticed, Tomas.

07:40.728 --> 07:42.696
His Holiness' visit
is a month away,

07:42.730 --> 07:43.997
and you're on
the welcoming committee.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.933
It's a big month
for the diocese,

07:45.966 --> 07:47.134
it's a big month for you.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.969
You keep your energy
on the job.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.604
This is part of my job.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.540
No, it isn't.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.842
All this video proves to me
is that this poor girl

07:54.875 --> 07:56.443
needs a psychiatrist.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.811
The attic was real.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.047
Tomas.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.583
Hmm?

08:03.751 --> 08:05.018
I hear you

08:05.052 --> 08:07.555
paid a visit to Saint Aquinas
the other day.

08:07.588 --> 08:09.657
(church bells tolling
in distance)

08:09.690 --> 08:11.825
One of their priests
has gone missing.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.193
A Father Marcus. You,

08:13.226 --> 08:15.395
you haven't seen him,
have you?

08:18.866 --> 08:20.734
Maria Walters.

08:20.768 --> 08:23.003
MARIA:
Angela Rance.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.304
Good to see you.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.406
Well, and you.
How are you?

08:26.439 --> 08:27.541
I'm well.

08:27.575 --> 08:28.542
(chuckles)

08:28.576 --> 08:30.678
Oh, love the bag.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.813
Its maiden voyage.
Ah.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.015
Sad we missed you
at the planning committee.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.584
A family issue, was it?

08:36.617 --> 08:38.586
Oh, my daughters--
daughter.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.521
It's working itself out.
Thank you for asking.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.857
How is Mr. Walters?

08:43.891 --> 08:45.993
George is a tough
son of bitch.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.528
So is cancer.
So it goes.
Yeah.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.698
Well, I have seen the place
about a dozen times,

08:50.731 --> 08:52.600
but let's make it official.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.134
Right.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.671
You brought the Pope.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.707
I brought the Pope.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.576
Well, the Second City
First Committee did.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.111
Your committee.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.278
George Senior's committee,

09:05.312 --> 09:07.915
but I am doing my best
in his absence.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.717
I have to think
your family's contributions

09:09.750 --> 09:11.852
to the Church didn't hurt.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.921
Rome loves a cheerful giver.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.422
Well, uh,

09:15.455 --> 09:17.891
we would be honored
to host His Holiness.

09:17.925 --> 09:20.027
Pope Sebastian
doesn't sleep in beds.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.095
He has a bedroll
he puts on the floor.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.097
Poverty, humility,

09:24.131 --> 09:26.700
be nicer to the gays.

09:26.734 --> 09:29.569
Sebastian's gonna sleep
in an undisclosed location.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.805
Do need a place for
a papal entourage.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.741
Absolu...
(phone chimes)

09:33.774 --> 09:35.542
And it is a...
Sorry.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.646
...a big, very
tightly wound group.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.550
Security is critical.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.551
(phone chimes)

09:44.584 --> 09:46.654
Uh... thank you.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.656
I'll be in touch.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.123
(chuckles)

09:54.695 --> 09:55.829
(line ringing)

09:55.863 --> 09:56.830
(line clicks)

09:56.864 --> 09:58.732
Casey? Hello?

09:58.766 --> 09:59.733
(Casey panting)

09:59.767 --> 10:01.802
Casey?

10:03.804 --> 10:05.806
Casey?

10:08.876 --> 10:11.611
Casey?

10:11.645 --> 10:13.981
Kat?

10:14.014 --> 10:16.516
Henry?

10:21.722 --> 10:22.790
(line ringing)

10:22.823 --> 10:24.658
(cell phone ringing upstairs)

10:26.660 --> 10:28.628
(line continues ringing)

10:28.662 --> 10:30.664
(cell phone continues ringing)

10:32.666 --> 10:34.668
(door creaking)

10:36.636 --> 10:38.638
(cell phone continues ringing)

10:49.683 --> 10:51.651
(door slams in distance)

10:51.685 --> 10:53.153
Casey?
HENRY: Did you...

10:53.186 --> 10:55.522
did you save any
of that for me?
CASEY: No.

10:55.555 --> 10:56.790
You drank that whole thing?
Yeah, it's mine.

10:56.824 --> 10:57.791
ANGELA:
Casey.

10:57.825 --> 10:58.792
Where were you?

10:58.826 --> 11:00.794
Um... out?

11:00.828 --> 11:03.630
Look who else we got
to come out of the house.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.632
Yeah. All it took was
the promise of ice cream.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.034
Thought you were
at work, Mom.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.669
I was. Did you call me?

11:09.703 --> 11:10.838
CASEY:
No.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.178
Oh! Aah!

11:18.211 --> 11:20.647
Oh, I'm never sleeping
on that pillow again.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.216
It's just a little bug.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.855
(Angela and Kat gasping)

11:30.423 --> 11:31.859
I'm gonna call the bug man.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.763
(panting)

11:43.070 --> 11:46.139
(train rumbling)

11:58.786 --> 12:00.821
(classic pop music
playing faintly)

12:02.622 --> 12:03.590
(door creaking)

12:03.623 --> 12:06.426
* Why, why you do me wrong

12:06.459 --> 12:08.762
* Oh, yeah

12:08.796 --> 12:11.464
* Yeah, yeah *

12:11.498 --> 12:13.700
* I want to know,
I want to know *

12:13.733 --> 12:15.702
* I gotta know

12:15.735 --> 12:19.572
* Well, when I first
met you, baby *

12:19.606 --> 12:21.809
* I was a sad-eye blue

12:21.842 --> 12:24.878
* I turned loose
a whole lot of girls *

12:24.912 --> 12:26.746
* To get real tight
with you... *

12:26.780 --> 12:28.782
We're out of eggs.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.583
How'd you get in here?

12:30.617 --> 12:31.952
Picked the lock.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.586
No, no.

12:33.620 --> 12:34.888
What are you doing here?

12:34.922 --> 12:37.925
You were the one
that came looking for me.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.897
Bit of spring reading, is it?

12:43.931 --> 12:45.966
Yes. That's the official
procedure, yes.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.101
Mm.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.737
Told anyone else about
your possessed person?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.739
The auxiliary bishop.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.008
(chuckles)
Bet he loved that.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.844
He tell you to bugger off?

12:58.812 --> 13:01.815
He told me you left Aquinas
after I saw you.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.151
You do exactly as you're told,
don't you?

13:04.184 --> 13:06.653
That was a week ago.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.588
Been sightseeing.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.590
The Shedd Aquarium.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.827
The big shiny bean in the park.

13:13.861 --> 13:17.497
St. Anthony's
of Lawndale, Chicago.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.968
Bit rough around the edges,
your parish.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.702
The Church is looking for you.

13:22.735 --> 13:25.772
Yeah, I could've guessed.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.941
Nicolas Cage fan.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.442
Aren't we all?

13:29.476 --> 13:31.778
(music stops)
Can you please stop doing that?

13:31.811 --> 13:35.048
This is not your home.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.850
You came and begged me for help

13:36.884 --> 13:38.051
with a case
of demonic possession,

13:38.085 --> 13:39.987
and now you got your knickers
in a twist

13:40.020 --> 13:41.621
'cause I didn't
bring you flowers?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.023
I don't actually know you.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.125
No.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.860
I don't know you.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.797
There are stages to a demonic
possession, my friend.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.867
Right now, my guess...

13:53.901 --> 13:56.136
the demon's gone possum.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.205
Gathering its strength,

13:58.238 --> 14:00.840
waiting to show
its ratty little teeth.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.676
And when it does...

14:03.710 --> 14:05.078
I'll kill the bastard.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.648
You'll probably watch.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.918
Or pass out.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.820
I once saw
this fat deacon in Muncie

14:13.853 --> 14:15.555
run right through
a sliding glass door.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.991
(kettle whistling)

14:18.025 --> 14:20.027
Fancy a cup of tea?

14:23.296 --> 14:25.832
I know what Saint Aquinas is.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.069
It's a place where
they send broken priests.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.077
Why were you there?

14:37.110 --> 14:40.047
Who's Jessica?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.083
(whistles blows,
excited chatter)

14:46.253 --> 14:49.222
(whistle blowing)

14:49.256 --> 14:51.058
(girls shouting)

15:05.973 --> 15:06.974
(Casey grunts, whistle blows)

15:09.276 --> 15:10.910
Watch it!
Watch what?

15:12.912 --> 15:14.881
(whistle blows)

15:14.914 --> 15:16.183
That's time.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.901
(whistle blows)

15:34.934 --> 15:36.936
(girls shouting)

15:49.949 --> 15:51.784
(grunts)

16:03.463 --> 16:04.964
Get up, Case!

16:09.736 --> 16:11.738
(quiet whooshing)

16:13.973 --> 16:16.243
Hey, Casey?

16:17.877 --> 16:18.911
Casey?

16:22.849 --> 16:24.751
(bone snaps)

16:26.153 --> 16:28.221
(groaning loudly)

16:31.424 --> 16:32.959
MAN: Casey, are you okay?
(girl sobbing)

16:32.992 --> 16:34.861
MARCUS:
Jesus told his apostles

16:34.894 --> 16:37.030
how to cast out
unclean spirits.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.465
"Fear them not," said the man,
"for there is nothing covered

16:38.498 --> 16:39.966
"that shall not be revealed,

16:39.999 --> 16:42.135
nor hidden
that shall not be known."

16:42.169 --> 16:43.870
You're deceiving yourself.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.305
Where there's a secret,
there's shame.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.240
Shame is a weapon
this demon will use against...

16:47.274 --> 16:48.408
I'm not ashamed
of Jessica.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.743
Who is she to you?
She's a friend.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.879
"I still remember
the smell of your hair."

16:52.912 --> 16:54.381
What, you... you
read the letters?

16:54.414 --> 16:56.483
Yeah, I read the letters,
so I know you're lying.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.551
"I don't dare think about you
unless I'm alone."

17:00.520 --> 17:03.190
We were together
when I was at Loyola.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.991
"I don't dare."
It's like 19th century prose.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.694
She help me with my English,
I help her with Spanish.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.196
It was a not a
long-term thing.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.663
She got married, I took
my vows, that's it.

17:10.697 --> 17:11.898
No shame in that.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.201
Will the Rance girl
be at this community picnic?

17:14.234 --> 17:15.368
I want to see her
before she knows who I am.

17:15.402 --> 17:18.138
Nothing happened since,
just so you know.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.143
It's just a memory of
something beautiful.

17:25.378 --> 17:29.216
You never gave up
something beautiful?

17:29.249 --> 17:30.483
No.

17:32.952 --> 17:35.255
Now who's deceiving themselves?

17:37.924 --> 17:41.228
I read the letters 'cause,
like a fool, you save them.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.430
They're important to you,
so I know about Jessica.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.232
What else don't I know about?

17:45.265 --> 17:46.899
'Cause the demon will.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.437
Exorcisms don't
simply fail, Tomas.

17:50.470 --> 17:54.541
The demon scatters
or the possessed die.

17:54.574 --> 17:59.045
How you conduct yourself
will determine what happens.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.813
Break it off with her, Tomas.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.915
For the sake
of the Rance girl.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.087
HENRY:
Casey makes a play.

18:08.121 --> 18:10.223
KAT: It's good. (laughs)
HENRY: Nice one.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.924
Good job, baby.
(chuckles)

18:11.958 --> 18:13.160
She's gonna win.
Ha. Your turn, dork.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.427
Did Mom buy this?

18:14.461 --> 18:16.329
Don't... No! Ah!

18:16.363 --> 18:17.464
What?

18:17.497 --> 18:18.498
(door closes)

18:18.531 --> 18:20.233
These are load-bearing
elements right here.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.101
You definitely made that up.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.070
I did not make it up; it exists
in the world of architecture,

18:24.103 --> 18:25.071
thank you very much.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.072
I went to college
for this.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.940
Okay, just for the record,

18:27.974 --> 18:30.109
you designed toilets
and not skyscrapers.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.111
Plumbing systems,
thank you very much.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.180
Oh, my God. Really?
You are such a plum.

18:33.213 --> 18:36.082
Miles and miles of
very sophisticated pipe.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.083
(Angela sighs)

18:37.116 --> 18:38.351
HENRY: Hi.
What'd I miss?

18:38.385 --> 18:39.952
Wow!

18:39.986 --> 18:41.254
I got hung up
at work, sorry.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.989
Yeah, we figured.

18:43.022 --> 18:43.990
(Angela sighs)

18:44.023 --> 18:45.192
Gulp.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.160
Hey, honey.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.262
Sit by me.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.163
Come be on my team.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.998
Okay.

18:52.031 --> 18:54.133
Uh, let's see.
(inhales sharply)

18:54.167 --> 18:55.101
This one looks great.
KAT: Mom, no.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.370
It's my turn.
Oh, sorry! Sorry.

18:57.404 --> 18:58.938
(whispers):
Kat's turn.
Okay, fine.

18:58.971 --> 18:59.939
Look at you.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.040
(exhales)

19:01.073 --> 19:03.310
HENRY: Ooh.
ANGELA: Good one!

19:03.343 --> 19:05.011
Thank you!
Very nice.

19:05.044 --> 19:06.246
How was your day, hon?

19:10.149 --> 19:11.117
Kat came to my game.
Oh!

19:11.150 --> 19:13.186
That's nice! That's great.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.189
Well, you know, someone
should be there for her.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.024
Leave her alone.
It's fine, Mom.

19:18.057 --> 19:19.292
Did you win?

19:19.326 --> 19:21.160
Yeah, well...
I mean, technically.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.962
The other team
was down a player.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.130
Ref should've pulled her
from the game

19:24.163 --> 19:25.332
way before she got hurt.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.299
Bitch was all over you.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.700
What happened?

19:27.734 --> 19:29.636
Bitch's leg snapped.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.571
Enough with the "bitches,"
Kit Kat.

19:33.573 --> 19:36.142
Her leg... snapped?

19:36.175 --> 19:38.144
Yeah.
KAT:
Better watch out.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.313
Mom's gonna sic Father Tomas
on you, too.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.314
HENRY:
What?

19:41.348 --> 19:42.649
She didn't tell you?

19:42.682 --> 19:45.218
She told him that I was
possessed by the Devil.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.419
What's she talking
about, Ange?

19:48.455 --> 19:50.523
Your daughter hasn't
seen the sun in months

19:50.557 --> 19:52.559
because she's recovering.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.160
Well...
And your other daughter...

19:54.193 --> 19:55.562
What about me, Mom?

19:57.597 --> 19:59.399
She's not herself, Henry.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.434
She's not herself.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.105
Honey, no. It'll fall.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.343
Holy crap!

20:10.377 --> 20:11.411
You see that?

20:13.045 --> 20:14.581
HENRY:
I don't understand

20:14.614 --> 20:17.149
how this is possible.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.256
(blocks clattering)

20:23.290 --> 20:25.224
HENRY (laughs):
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

20:25.258 --> 20:26.693
KAT (laughs): Ho, ho, ho!
HENRY: Okay.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.060
I told ya.

20:28.094 --> 20:29.128
Game over.
Yeah.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.203
(thunder rumbling softly)

20:37.236 --> 20:38.938
(excited chatter)

20:38.971 --> 20:41.974
ISABEL:
I know some of your faces.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.243
For years, I ate alongside you
in the soup kitchens,

20:44.277 --> 20:46.078
and slept alongside you

20:46.112 --> 20:48.114
on the streets
and in the shelters

20:48.147 --> 20:51.083
on days like these, when the
rain just wouldn't let up, yeah?

20:51.117 --> 20:52.251
I was an addict.

20:52.285 --> 20:55.154
I used to steal, cheat and lie

20:55.187 --> 20:56.389
for my next fix.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.157
Didn't have no friends left
in the world.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.225
(microphone feedback squeals)

20:59.258 --> 21:00.226
But Father Tomas...

21:00.259 --> 21:01.294
(Tomas praying in Spanish)

21:01.328 --> 21:04.397
ISABEL: ...got me set up
in this program.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.899
That was two years ago.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.436
Father Tomas. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to interrupt.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.270
I wanted to have
a word in private.

21:11.304 --> 21:12.271
Of course, Angela.

21:12.305 --> 21:13.473
How's Casey?

21:13.506 --> 21:15.342
She looks okay, no?

21:15.375 --> 21:17.577
No. Things are worse.

21:17.610 --> 21:20.913
The demon-- it-it
can move things.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.515
It can hurt
other people.

21:22.549 --> 21:24.451
I spoke with Bishop Egan
about your situation.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.085
Yes.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.455
Um... he wants her
to see a therapist

21:28.488 --> 21:29.689
before we do anything drastic.

21:29.722 --> 21:32.124
You know she doesn't
need therapy, Father.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.361
I...
You saw what you
saw in the attic.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.862
I know.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.030
But there are rules.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.298
Procedures we have--

21:39.332 --> 21:42.168
Oh, are you walking
back on this?

21:42.201 --> 21:45.505
An exorcism is an extreme thing.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.440
You said you were
going to help us.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.141
I am.

21:49.175 --> 21:52.479
I'm on your side, but right now,
we need the Church

21:52.512 --> 21:54.447
to be on our side, too.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.683
I-I am sorry.
I have to bless the food line.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.485
We'll talk soon.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.953
ISABEL:
I'm paying my own rent
with money that I earn

22:00.987 --> 22:04.123
at a job I got at Parks and Rec,
and I'm going to night school,

22:04.156 --> 22:06.125
because I really like
making money.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.628
And real talk?
I need a promotion.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.663
(laughter)

22:12.365 --> 22:14.100
(water splashes on floor)

22:19.338 --> 22:21.140
God helps those
who help themselves, right?

22:21.173 --> 22:24.477
Oh... I'm sorry. I, uh...

22:24.511 --> 22:26.479
I-I know I'm not supposed
to take the-the holy water.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.515
I just...
it was, uh...

22:28.548 --> 22:32.084
You're Angela Rance.
Casey's mom.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.588
I definitely don't know
who you are.

22:39.392 --> 22:41.628
You know how to use that?

22:45.097 --> 22:47.400
Put it in
her drinking water.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.602
It'll appear difficult,

22:49.636 --> 22:51.604
but really...

22:51.638 --> 22:53.506
it's just hard on the demon.

22:53.540 --> 22:55.207
ISABEL:
Some of you just
go to church here...

22:55.241 --> 22:57.209
And those who have to watch.

22:57.243 --> 23:00.547
...like this...
are the first step.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.449
Being homeless means
that you are alone,

23:02.482 --> 23:03.616
you're vulnerable.

23:03.650 --> 23:07.119
You're there to be
taken advantage of.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.088
So if you can,
dig in your pockets

23:09.121 --> 23:11.424
and give whatever you can.

23:11.458 --> 23:15.161
Let's hear it for St. Anthony's
and Father Tomas.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.068
(sighs)

23:22.101 --> 23:23.169
(speaking in Latin)

23:27.239 --> 23:29.442
You can start.
Thank you.

23:33.312 --> 23:34.614
Excuse me. Can I just...?

23:34.647 --> 23:36.348
Sorry.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.420
Thank you.

23:41.454 --> 23:42.455
Turkey chili or lentil?

23:42.489 --> 23:43.790
Uh...

23:43.823 --> 23:46.225
I don't know.
Which one do you like?

23:46.258 --> 23:48.595
Well, I hate lentils, so...
(laughs)

23:48.628 --> 23:50.863
Turkey chili it is, then.
Okay.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.433
I like your accent.

23:54.467 --> 23:55.835
Yeah, well, um...

23:55.868 --> 23:57.504
I like your ladle.

23:57.537 --> 23:58.605
(laughs)

23:58.638 --> 24:00.172
The name's Marcus.

24:00.206 --> 24:02.208
Casey.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.377
Turkey chili or lentil?

24:06.378 --> 24:07.580
Chili's really good.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.181
WOMAN: Hi.
(Casey chuckles)

24:18.558 --> 24:20.593
Kind of humid
from that rain.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.695
Yeah, it is.

24:32.739 --> 24:35.307
Hi.

24:35.341 --> 24:36.676
I know you.

24:40.246 --> 24:43.249
He chose you.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.319
You're so special.

24:47.353 --> 24:49.488
Has he touched you?

24:51.490 --> 24:53.325
Let me touch you.

24:53.359 --> 24:55.662
(dish clatters,
people gasping)

24:55.695 --> 24:56.495
ANGELA:
Casey!

24:56.529 --> 24:58.330
Let me touch you.

24:58.364 --> 24:59.732
Let me touch you!

25:01.534 --> 25:04.503
Lupus in fabula,

25:04.537 --> 25:06.606
venit enim ad me.

25:08.440 --> 25:09.776
Casey, you okay?

25:17.950 --> 25:20.553
TOMAS:
The auxiliary bishop
is a very important guy.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.421
He's my mentor.

25:22.454 --> 25:24.924
He told me not to do something,

25:24.957 --> 25:28.728
but I know I should do it,
and there is this man...

25:28.761 --> 25:33.700
I know I shouldn't trust,
but for some reason, I... I do.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.837
This is why you
wanted to meet?

25:37.870 --> 25:40.372
Advice about work?

25:40.406 --> 25:42.709
Well, you know me
better than anyone.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.177
You... you-you always have.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.846
I told two lies just
to get here tonight.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.748
Actually, three.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.449
I'm sorry.

25:50.482 --> 25:52.619
I just wanted to see you. I...

25:52.652 --> 25:54.621
I always want to see you.

25:54.654 --> 25:57.624
Well, you called
and I came.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.626
I'm right here.

26:03.429 --> 26:06.465
Our old spot.

26:06.498 --> 26:09.268
Seemed appropriate.

26:09.301 --> 26:12.438
I hadn't had a letter in a
while; I thought maybe you'd...

26:14.440 --> 26:15.608
It's been a year.

26:15.642 --> 26:17.610
13 months and a week.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.478
Almost.

26:19.511 --> 26:20.613
Your English...

26:33.025 --> 26:34.460
(chuckles)

26:35.928 --> 26:38.731
(laughs)

26:38.765 --> 26:41.768
You should let a girl
take you shopping.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.473
How's Jim?

26:50.376 --> 26:52.311
He's fine. It's fine.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.346
Hmm.

26:56.348 --> 26:58.685
It's not fine;
you know this.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.955
You look exactly the same,
you know.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.057
You look nice.

27:06.158 --> 27:08.360
You, too.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.629
What are you
gonna do about it?

27:16.736 --> 27:18.771
I'm sorry. I...

27:18.805 --> 27:21.808
I-I can't. I...

27:24.744 --> 27:26.813
I can't.

27:26.846 --> 27:27.847
I just can't.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.716
I'm just stupid.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.517
Please. Stay, stay, stay.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.052
You're already here.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.721
Please just s-stay.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.889
Write me another letter.

27:36.923 --> 27:38.925
I love getting letters.

27:44.931 --> 27:46.665
(over headphones):
* It's probably been 12 years

27:46.699 --> 27:49.501
* Since my father left,
left me fatherless *

27:49.535 --> 27:50.737
* And I just used to say
I hate him *

27:50.770 --> 27:52.471
* In dishonest jest

27:52.504 --> 27:54.506
* When honestly I miss...

27:54.540 --> 27:56.909
* Like when I was six
and every time I got... *

27:56.943 --> 27:58.077
(music fades)

27:58.110 --> 28:00.112
(vehicle approaching)

28:06.418 --> 28:08.420
MAN:
Get in. Let's go.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.568
(cat meowing)

28:35.782 --> 28:39.551
They said you were gone
for good.

28:39.585 --> 28:41.453
Always knew
you'd be back.

28:41.487 --> 28:42.721
Do I know you?

28:42.755 --> 28:44.556
No.

28:44.590 --> 28:46.092
But we know you.

28:46.125 --> 28:49.796
Everyone knows
Father Marcus.

28:49.829 --> 28:52.098
The one we feared,

28:52.131 --> 28:55.802
until you lost
that little boy.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.771
(Gabriel's voice
speaking Spanish)

29:00.439 --> 29:02.875
Unclean spirit,

29:02.909 --> 29:05.778
come out into the light!

29:05.812 --> 29:07.446
I order you!

29:07.479 --> 29:09.949
(demonic voice):
Order me?

29:17.656 --> 29:20.092
On whose authority?

29:20.126 --> 29:24.897
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

29:24.931 --> 29:27.934
Ooh! All three?

29:27.967 --> 29:28.968
Well, then.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.838
I command you.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.772
In the name of
the Lord Jesus Christ

29:33.806 --> 29:36.108
and His Almighty Host,
release this woman!

29:41.647 --> 29:43.950
So it's true what they say.

29:43.983 --> 29:48.787
The power...
of Christ compels you.

29:48.821 --> 29:51.523
Do I look compelled?

29:51.557 --> 29:53.792
Man of God.

29:53.826 --> 29:57.463
Mighty Marcus.

29:57.496 --> 30:01.067
Vessel of nothing!

30:09.008 --> 30:11.010
(wind whooshing)

30:24.857 --> 30:26.625
HENRY:
Smells good, honey.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.727
KAT:
I like that bracelet.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.662
Two.

30:30.696 --> 30:32.999
What happened
to your shirt?

30:33.032 --> 30:34.833
CASEY: I'm gonna put
it away for tonight.

30:34.867 --> 30:35.801
ANGELA:
Okay.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.169
It's starting to stink.

30:37.203 --> 30:39.906
There you go.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.673
HENRY:
Ready?

30:41.707 --> 30:44.043
Okay?
Yeah.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.044
HENRY:
In the name of the Father,

30:45.077 --> 30:47.513
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

30:47.546 --> 30:50.016
Bless us, Dear God,
for these Thy gifts

30:50.049 --> 30:52.051
which we are about to receive...

30:58.557 --> 30:59.926
From Thy...

31:02.394 --> 31:03.930
...about to receive

31:03.963 --> 31:06.198
from Thy bountiful hands,
through Christ our Lord.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.034
Amen.

31:08.067 --> 31:10.169
ANGELA:
Amen.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.038
Okay.
(clears throat)

31:18.978 --> 31:23.149
I wanted to, uh, apologize
for last night.

31:29.055 --> 31:30.289
KAT:
Geez, Mom,

31:30.322 --> 31:31.924
the drama is killing me.

31:33.625 --> 31:37.229
I'm sorry I was late
for game night, and, um...

31:37.263 --> 31:40.632
I'm sorry I've been
so distracted.

31:42.901 --> 31:46.072
I love you all
more than anything.

31:46.105 --> 31:50.042
Are you sorry that you
think I'm the Devil?

31:50.076 --> 31:52.911
Yes, Kat.
Yes, I am.

31:52.945 --> 31:55.014
I'm sorry that you
are in so much pain.

31:56.815 --> 32:00.119
And I'm sorry that I don't
know how to handle it.

32:00.152 --> 32:04.123
I don't even know where to start
with what you've been through.

32:07.693 --> 32:09.695
We're all getting stronger.

32:11.998 --> 32:14.000
Day by day.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.638
KAT: Here.
These are good.

32:19.671 --> 32:20.639
HENRY:
Thank you.

32:20.672 --> 32:21.640
(clears throat)

32:21.673 --> 32:23.009
Mm-hmm.

32:25.978 --> 32:28.114
You okay?

32:28.147 --> 32:31.283
(chuckles):
Yeah. Why?

32:34.053 --> 32:36.088
Dinner's good, Mom.

32:36.122 --> 32:38.124
You're getting good at
this whole cooking thing.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.391
HENRY:
Mm-hmm.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.964
(Henry laughs)

32:45.998 --> 32:48.034
No, tell them about the crown
roast. Tell them about that...

32:48.067 --> 32:50.036
ANGELA: In my defense,
I never had made one,

32:50.069 --> 32:52.871
and the package did not say, uh,

32:52.904 --> 32:55.041
take the plastic thing off,
so you know,

32:55.074 --> 32:56.208
how was I supposed to know?

32:56.242 --> 32:57.976
KAT:
So you cooked it with it on?

32:58.010 --> 33:00.646
HENRY: Sure did. (laughs)
ANGELA: Well, how did...

33:00.679 --> 33:03.049
You know, I figured you had
to leave it so it would stay

33:03.082 --> 33:04.816
in that shape, you know?

33:04.850 --> 33:06.552
HENRY:
Show her what it looked like.
(laughs)

33:06.585 --> 33:08.054
I'm gonna bail for the night.

33:08.087 --> 33:09.988
I'm way behind
on my psych reading, so...

33:10.022 --> 33:11.990
Okay, good night, honey.
Okay, honey.

33:12.024 --> 33:14.026
(Henry and Angela
continue talking, laughing)

33:24.836 --> 33:27.239
(coughing)

33:42.954 --> 33:44.956
(gasping softly)

33:56.902 --> 33:58.270
(insect chittering)

33:58.304 --> 34:00.306
(gagging)

34:05.077 --> 34:06.078
(coughs)

34:08.414 --> 34:10.048
(toilet flushing)

34:10.082 --> 34:11.049
(gasps)

34:11.083 --> 34:13.085
(panting)

34:23.795 --> 34:26.165
(train horn blowing in distance)

34:36.942 --> 34:39.311
(gate creaking)

34:39.345 --> 34:40.579
May I?

34:42.080 --> 34:44.082
(gate closes)

34:47.619 --> 34:49.988
Why the long face?

34:51.690 --> 34:54.760
I think there's something
really wrong with me.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.729
I'm afraid not, my dear.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.431
Just a glorious seed

34:59.465 --> 35:02.368
breaching the soil.

35:03.502 --> 35:06.705
A first glimpse of the sun.

35:14.180 --> 35:16.648
Now...

35:16.682 --> 35:18.617
tell me everything.

35:19.785 --> 35:23.655
So, this has to be
a secret, okay?

35:23.689 --> 35:26.625
Remember that girl
who broke her leg?

35:26.658 --> 35:27.993
It sounds crazy, but...

35:28.026 --> 35:30.762
I think I caused it.

35:30.796 --> 35:35.301
What's worse is
tonight at dinner, this...

35:35.334 --> 35:38.103
thing came out of...

35:38.136 --> 35:40.372
(train rumbling in distance)

35:54.253 --> 35:56.255
(door opens, closes)

36:05.764 --> 36:08.867
Were you going to
tell me about this?

36:10.902 --> 36:12.271
So I won't forget.

36:14.206 --> 36:17.409
You were watching me.

36:17.443 --> 36:19.010
You edit the Bible.

36:19.044 --> 36:24.015
You have pictures of
tortured children in here!

36:24.049 --> 36:27.085
You must have witnessed.
You must have participated.

36:27.118 --> 36:28.487
The bloke at the picnic,
the schizophrenic--

36:28.520 --> 36:30.356
why do you think
he's hearing voices?

36:30.389 --> 36:31.189
How should I know?

36:31.223 --> 36:33.191
He recognized the demon

36:33.225 --> 36:35.361
inside of her.

36:35.394 --> 36:38.230
"Lupus in fabula,
venit enim ad me."

36:38.264 --> 36:40.031
"Speak of the Devil
and he shall appear."

36:40.065 --> 36:42.100
It's not just Casey's demon,
Tomas.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.202
There are many of them here.

36:44.236 --> 36:46.137
I think you should go.

36:48.139 --> 36:49.207
(train horn blows in distance)

36:49.241 --> 36:51.142
Now.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.313
(train rumbling)

37:11.430 --> 37:14.366
When I was seven...

37:14.400 --> 37:18.604
my dad killed my mum
in front of me.

37:20.639 --> 37:23.041
I was, um...

37:23.074 --> 37:27.379
shoved in a boys' home
for a few years

37:27.413 --> 37:32.250
before being sold to the Church.

37:32.284 --> 37:36.288
Five quid for a boy
and a birth certificate.

37:39.024 --> 37:42.994
I did four more years
with a man called Sean

37:43.028 --> 37:45.431
in the darkest little
corner of the Church.

37:45.464 --> 37:46.665
I won't bore you

37:46.698 --> 37:49.335
with that particular narrative,

37:49.368 --> 37:53.339
but the first time they locked
me in a room with a demon...

37:54.640 --> 37:57.108
...I was 12 years old.

37:57.142 --> 38:00.446
You know, when
you first saw

38:00.479 --> 38:04.450
that demon in
the attic, Tomas,

38:04.483 --> 38:07.353
were you scared?

38:07.386 --> 38:09.455
Yes.

38:09.488 --> 38:12.458
You know what I felt?

38:12.491 --> 38:14.493
Relief.

38:17.228 --> 38:21.467
'Cause for the first time
in my brief...

38:21.500 --> 38:25.203
but very long life,
I had a purpose.

38:27.205 --> 38:29.675
I was the gun,
and the Church was the hand,

38:29.708 --> 38:32.478
and the words...

38:32.511 --> 38:34.212
were true.

38:40.352 --> 38:42.688
You've read about
the Beatific Vision?

38:46.224 --> 38:49.194
Being one with God.

38:49.227 --> 38:51.397
Seeing His face.

38:55.401 --> 38:57.569
I saw it once.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.173
At the moment of exorcism.

39:02.207 --> 39:05.477
I saw it, and it was so... loud.

39:05.511 --> 39:06.512
(sobbing softly)

39:06.545 --> 39:09.180
I could hear it.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.419
There is such a...

39:13.452 --> 39:16.455
noise in my head, Tomas.

39:19.525 --> 39:20.692
(sniffles)

39:20.726 --> 39:22.327
I'm not fit.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.262
And...

39:24.295 --> 39:25.664
uh, you should know that.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.365
And... (sniffles)

39:27.399 --> 39:31.369
I haven't had that, uh,
vision since.

39:31.403 --> 39:34.005
Most of the words in here,
they're man's words.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.173
They're not God's.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.275
But I can try.
(sniffles)

39:37.308 --> 39:38.544
If that's
what He wants,

39:38.577 --> 39:43.515
I swear... on my life,

39:43.549 --> 39:45.551
I can try.

39:48.119 --> 39:50.055
I saw Jessica today.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.225
And?

39:57.463 --> 40:00.432
I don't know.
I don't know.

40:03.168 --> 40:05.370
Sh...

40:05.403 --> 40:07.773
Shall we try this together?

40:15.847 --> 40:18.316
Lord,

40:18.349 --> 40:21.152
make me an instrument
of Thy peace.

40:22.754 --> 40:26.558
Where there is hatred,
let me sow love;

40:26.592 --> 40:30.161
where there is
injury, pardon...

40:30.195 --> 40:33.465
BOTH:
...where there is doubt, faith;

40:33.499 --> 40:37.168
where there is despair, hope;

40:37.202 --> 40:40.371
where there is darkness, light.

40:42.541 --> 40:44.342
(over headphones):
* It's evident, and them eyes

40:44.375 --> 40:46.177
* Where he hiding
all them icicles at? *

40:46.211 --> 40:48.179
* Something sinister to it

40:48.213 --> 40:51.182
* Pendulum swinging slow,
a degenerate moving *

40:51.216 --> 40:53.084
* Through the city
with criminals, stealth *

40:53.118 --> 40:55.587
* Welcome to enemy turf,
harder than immigrants work *

40:55.621 --> 40:57.623
* "Golf" is stitched
into my shirt *

40:57.656 --> 41:00.792
* Get up off the pavement, brush
the dirt up off my psyche *

41:00.826 --> 41:02.628
* Psyche, psyche

41:02.661 --> 41:04.462
(sportscast playing over TV)

41:04.496 --> 41:06.431
TV ANNOUNCER:
Pass it off to Gonzalez.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.600
He tries to get outside.
Picks up one, maybe...

41:08.634 --> 41:10.268
What's up, Pop?

41:10.301 --> 41:12.470
* Time lapse, bars rot
in heart's bottomless pit *

41:12.504 --> 41:16.341
* Was mobbin' deep as
'96 Havoc and Prodigy did... *

41:16.374 --> 41:17.509
(woman grunts)

41:17.543 --> 41:18.577
Andre!

41:19.678 --> 41:20.612
Andre!

41:20.646 --> 41:21.580
(grunting)

41:23.515 --> 41:25.483
* His sins feeling as hard

41:25.517 --> 41:27.653
* As Vince Carter's
knee cartilage is *

41:27.686 --> 41:30.556
* Supreme garment and weed
gardeners garnishing spliffs *

41:30.589 --> 41:32.858
* With keef particles
and entering apartments *

41:32.891 --> 41:36.327
* With 'zine article,
tolerance for boundaries... *

41:36.361 --> 41:37.529
(grunts)

41:37.563 --> 41:38.530
(music stops)

41:38.564 --> 41:39.598
(body thuds)

41:40.699 --> 41:41.733
(crowd cheering over TV)

41:47.539 --> 41:49.541
(crickets chirping)

41:57.248 --> 41:59.250
*

42:19.270 --> 42:21.272
*

42:31.650 --> 42:33.551
NEWSCASTER (over TV):
This is Kiesa Marks,

42:33.585 --> 42:34.953
reporting live
from West Englewood,

42:34.986 --> 42:37.522
where nine people
were killed tonight

42:37.555 --> 42:40.692
in what investigators
are calling a mass homicide.

42:40.726 --> 42:42.728
Local police here
are being extra quiet,

42:42.761 --> 42:45.631
and there are few details
beyond a body count.

42:45.664 --> 42:47.232
But what I can tell you

42:47.265 --> 42:50.268
is that the victims
did not die from gunfire.

42:50.301 --> 42:51.269
These were all

42:51.302 --> 42:52.904
brutal stabbings.

42:52.938 --> 42:55.440
I did talk briefly
to Superintendent Jaffe,

42:55.473 --> 42:57.575
who said this is
clearly gang-related.

42:57.609 --> 43:00.378
It's a familiar night
in Englewood.

43:00.411 --> 43:03.281
People are afraid
and very angry.

43:49.961 --> 43:52.831
