WEBVTT

00:03.020 --> 00:03.600
" Why me?

00:03.700 --> 00:05.190
Because I'm always having to break the bad news.

00:05.250 --> 00:06.620
I'm like the family grim reaper.

00:06.700 --> 00:07.460
Okay, you know what? Someone--

00:07.550 --> 00:09.280
mom--is gonna blame us for this,all right?

00:09.360 --> 00:11.410
I think you, the smooth-talking lawyer, should tell her.

00:11.510 --> 00:12.020
Why?

00:12.100 --> 00:14.500
Because--justin, here, try one of these.

00:14.590 --> 00:17.470
Scotty is making 200 of 'em for the opening of center tomorrow.

00:17.550 --> 00:18.920
I want an unbiased opinion.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.370
I'm, uh, I'm not hungry, mom.

00:20.440 --> 00:23.290
Why? You're always hungry.

00:23.380 --> 00:27.420
Uh, uh, bottoms up.

00:27.620 --> 00:28.570
it's like heaven, ma.

00:28.660 --> 00:30.900
Good. Well, at least something's on track,

00:30.980 --> 00:34.550
because Shawna Renaldo canceled on us.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.830
I've got all these families struggling with cancer,

00:36.910 --> 00:39.530
and this diva can't be bothered to show up and sing.

00:39.580 --> 00:41.340
I don't even know who that is, mom.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.730
Well, she was third runner-up on that singing 
competition show.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.780
Kevin told me about her.

00:45.860 --> 00:47.550
He voted for her 18 times or something.

00:47.620 --> 00:48.830
What? She happens to be a genius.

00:48.900 --> 00:49.960
She was totally robbed.

00:50.030 --> 00:52.460
Well, to hell with her.

00:52.530 --> 00:56.680
I'm not gonna let her spoil what you're about to do.

00:56.750 --> 00:59.140
You think I can't guess what you're up to?

00:59.140 --> 01:03.080
and it's so great that you want to honor my center privately, as a family.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.060
It means so much to me.

01:05.160 --> 01:10.050
I'm gonna go upstairs and get ryan, tell him we're gathering.

01:10.110 --> 01:13.820
Oh,you--you didn't hit him up for a donation, did you?

01:13.880 --> 01:15.880
Because I don't think he has two nickels to rub together.

01:15.960 --> 01:18.150
-No. -Okay,good.

01:18.210 --> 01:19.960
That's great. Now we're including freakin' ryan in our family meetings?

01:20.040 --> 01:23.050
Forget that. She thinks we're about to hand her a big check

01:23.120 --> 01:24.780
how much money do you have on you?

01:24.840 --> 01:29.010
I've got,uh,$5 and a couple of pesos.

01:29.070 --> 01:30.710
I want that back,though.

01:30.950 --> 01:31.720
hey!We're here.

01:31.820 --> 01:32.960
We're here,and this better be good,

01:33.040 --> 01:34.660
because I came all the way from santa barbara.

01:34.730 --> 01:35.450
This better be quick,

01:35.550 --> 01:38.480
because we're supposed to be moving into our greenatopia offices today.

01:38.610 --> 01:40.270
yeah,and I-- did anyone bring a-a checkbook?

01:40.340 --> 01:42.420
You know what?Forget it.It's not gonna help.

01:42.540 --> 01:44.480
Help what?What's happening?

01:44.570 --> 01:45.780
We have to wait for mom.Come on.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.670
You know family meetings have rules.

01:47.760 --> 01:49.910
Oh,okay,then check this out.

01:49.990 --> 01:52.940
New greenatopia space-- the boys are so impressed.

01:53.020 --> 01:54.670
You want to see impressive?

01:54.770 --> 01:55.780
Okay,are you rey for this?

01:55.850 --> 01:57.800
A 3 week old who can already hold up his head.

01:57.870 --> 02:01.140
-look at that face. -That's early,kitty.

02:01.230 --> 02:02.990
Paige was- uh,well,fancy that.

02:03.070 --> 02:04.300
He's already up and out.

02:04.420 --> 02:06.860
The first early riser in the history of the walker family.

02:06.920 --> 02:07.530
what are you talking about?

02:07.620 --> 02:08.970
I got up every--every day...

02:09.070 --> 02:10.539
mom,when I was at rowing camp...

02:10.650 --> 02:13.310
can we start?can we start?!

02:13.360 --> 02:14.970
Yes!Yes!

02:15.080 --> 02:18.250
N-no,no.Tommy's not here.

02:18.350 --> 02:24.690
That's actually what we wanted to talk about.

02:25.030 --> 02:28.940
tommy's not coming because he didn't come back from mexico with us.

02:29.020 --> 02:29.950
Mexico?

02:30.020 --> 02:31.990
-You went to mexico? -Yeah,it was sarah's idea.

02:32.050 --> 02:33.250
What?Wa uP.No.

02:33.330 --> 02:35.180
I told him to get tommy off my couch.

02:35.260 --> 02:36.690
I didn't say "take him out of the country.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.690
" Well,the judge didn't think he was a flight risk.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.620
What are you saying,kevin?

02:40.690 --> 02:42.650
Where is he now?

02:42.720 --> 02:44.760
Well,we don't know 'cause he didn't tell us where he was going.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.870
-Well,did you try him on his cell? -Yeah,of course.

02:46.940 --> 02:48.310
-He's not picking up. -Oh,my god.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.270
He--he could be lying in a ditch somewhere.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.030
He's not,because he left us a note.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.350
What did the note say?

02:53.440 --> 02:54.980
You know what?You can jump in at any time here.

02:55.090 --> 02:58.530
Okay,it--the note said,"I'm sorry,t I'm t coming back with you.

02:58.630 --> 03:00.180
" So do you think he's trying to skip bail?

03:00.330 --> 03:05.210
No,he's spending every waking hour getting ready for his court date next week.

03:05.300 --> 03:06.810
Yeah,that's why we went down there,

03:06.890 --> 03:10.070
mom,to talk him out of fighting the charges and take a plea.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.070
Why?

03:11.140 --> 03:14.290
-Because he did it.He didn't stand a chance. -he's guilty.

03:14.390 --> 03:15.920
Well,no wonder he disappeared.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.530
-I told you we'd get blamed for this. -Well,yeah,you know what?

03:17.610 --> 03:19.310
It's ptty stupid to take him to mexico.

03:19.390 --> 03:23.720
-What? -Listen.Does holly know?

03:23.800 --> 03:25.290
No,and don't tell anybody,okay?

03:25.370 --> 03:26.290
That includes rebecca.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.180
Especially rebecca.

03:27.370 --> 03:28.750
Do you have any idea where he is now?

03:28.820 --> 03:31.180
I think we can safely say somewhere in mexico or central america.

03:31.270 --> 03:32.980
Oh,stop it.All of you,stop it.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.210
Tommy is going to come back.

03:34.300 --> 03:35.880
My god,he's got a wife and a child.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.390
He's not gonna abandon them.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.390
He left julia a letter.We took it to her this morning.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.460
what did it say?

03:40.610 --> 03:42.910
Well,we didn'ready it,but I think it's pretty obvious what it said.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.060
You don't know.

03:44.160 --> 03:47.250
The only thing obvious here is that tommy needs help,and believe me,

03:47.330 --> 03:50.210
if it was any one of you,he would be the first one up and out the door.

03:50.290 --> 03:51.900
What are we supposed to do,mom?

03:51.990 --> 03:59.280
Look,I'm not gonna stand around here and pretend there's nothing we can do.

04:00.550 --> 04:03.570
-Anybody pretending? -No.

04:03.670 --> 04:06.150
I can't believe you went all the way to wilshire for the,

04:06.280 --> 04:07.540
but it is so worth it.

04:07.630 --> 04:09.950
Well,I do sort of have an ulterior motive.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.220
Oh,yeah?

04:11.320 --> 04:13.190
I was kinda hoping you could help me out with something.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.240
Yeah,sure.What is it?

04:15.340 --> 04:19.350
Well,you know how your mom said she didn't know anything about the affair my mom had with william?

04:19.430 --> 04:20.899
Yeah,I really don't think she did.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.270
I know.I believe you.I just...

04:23.390 --> 04:25.940
I have a feeling there's a way I could find out more.

04:26.030 --> 04:27.550
About the affair?

04:27.650 --> 04:28.760
About why she died.

04:28.840 --> 04:31.410
I'm telling you,the week before she went to reno,she was good.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.900
I mean,she was better than good.

04:33.990 --> 04:35.270
Something must have happened.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.010
And you think it was william?

04:37.110 --> 04:39.780
Well,what if they talked or what if she saw him?

04:39.860 --> 04:43.490
Maybe there's travel records or phone bills...

04:43.590 --> 04:46.240
at ojai.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.110
They did meet through business.

04:48.190 --> 04:53.640
Yeah,but even if they were still in contact then,what would that give you?

04:53.750 --> 04:57.370
A reason why she killed herself.

04:57.460 --> 05:00.830
listen,I want to help you,it's just-- this is where I work.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.100
You know what?

05:03.190 --> 05:04.490
-Never mind. -I know how important the truth is.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.460
I mean,people lied to me my whole life-- no,really,it's okay.

05:07.550 --> 05:10.300
I overstepped.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.530
I'm sorry.

05:19.770 --> 05:22.790
-Hi. -Justin.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.260
Oh,look,I,uh,I-- I shoulda called first.

05:26.510 --> 05:27.910
Um-- hey,justin.

05:27.990 --> 05:30.930
No,ryan just brought over some bagels.You should come in.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.100
Uh,no,thanks.

05:32.220 --> 05:33.190
Is something wrong?

05:33.300 --> 05:34.350
It's no big deal.It can wait.

05:34.430 --> 05:36.530
You know what?Why don't you guys catch up?

05:36.610 --> 05:37.360
Uh,are you sure?

05:37.460 --> 05:41.350
Yeah,I'll just,uh,I'll take mine for the road.

05:41.460 --> 05:43.480
-see you later. -Bye.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.550
it's not what you think.

05:47.650 --> 05:49.620
What do I think?

05:49.710 --> 05:50.910
Justin,why are you here?

05:51.010 --> 05:54.180
Look,I,uh,I just wanted to see you.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.260
Come in.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:08.860 --> 06:10.270
You're here.We tried calling you.

06:10.390 --> 06:11.310
Oh,I'm so sorry.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.910
I was,uh,caught in the middle of a-- well,the site overloaded.

06:13.990 --> 06:16.120
There was way too much traffic,which is a good thing,

06:16.220 --> 06:20.110
but-- we had to dip in the reserve fund and buy more server space.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.300
Good.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.580
Okay,well done.

06:22.680 --> 06:23.700
Really?

06:23.800 --> 06:24.980
-You're not mad? -No.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.710
That'shat I would've done.

06:26.850 --> 06:27.660
-Nice. -Well...

06:27.760 --> 06:29.790
-good. -Let's hope we're on a roll.

06:29.880 --> 06:30.510
Go get 'em.

06:30.610 --> 06:33.920
-The office looks great. -I know.I painted it myself.

06:33.990 --> 06:34.840
What's this?

06:34.920 --> 06:36.520
There it is.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.460
New business cards.

06:38.540 --> 06:40.820
Made from recycled cereal boxes.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.210
D with soy ink.

06:42.290 --> 06:43.910
Come on,you guys.You didn't have to.

06:43.990 --> 06:44.630
Yeah,we did.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.100
I mean,without you,none of this-- like,

06:46.190 --> 06:48.320
not one bit of this-- would've been possible.

06:48.390 --> 06:53.950
Yeah,I mean,you could've walked away so many times,but you didn'T.

06:54.030 --> 06:55.420
You don't like them,do you?

06:55.500 --> 06:57.670
No,they're great.Come on.I love them.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.280
No,it's just,uh...

06:59.380 --> 07:00.750
there's this family thing.

07:00.830 --> 07:01.970
Oh,did somethinhappen?

07:02.050 --> 07:03.670
Yeah,but I don't really want to go into it.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.230
Besides,this is a very important day for us.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.040
We should enjoy it.

07:08.170 --> 07:11.260
I'm sorry to just show up on your doorstep like this.

07:11.350 --> 07:16.160
I tried to call but-- no,it's fine.

07:16.290 --> 07:18.170
Here's the letter.

07:18.260 --> 07:20.110
I hope you don't mind,I need to get lunch ready.

07:20.180 --> 07:23.100
Uh,the sitter's gonna be back with elizabeth soon.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.010
No.No,it's fine.

07:24.090 --> 07:27.200
You go ahead and just do whatever it is you have to do.

07:27.260 --> 07:33.310
I'm just really grateful you would le leerla.

07:33.920 --> 07:34.810
I don't understand.

07:34.890 --> 07:37.650
How could he not tell you where he's going?

07:37.720 --> 07:41.700
he stopped telling me where he was going and what he was doing a long time ago.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.430
Did he leave anything else for you?

07:44.520 --> 07:46.540
Sides some dirty laundry?

07:46.630 --> 07:47.490
Nope.

07:47.570 --> 07:49.050
Nada.

07:49.460 --> 07:50.940
Oh,I don't know.

07:51.060 --> 07:54.660
Ever since saul and sarah left ojai,and then elizabeth got so sick,

07:54.750 --> 07:57.920
he--he just lost track of who he is.

07:58.030 --> 07:59.330
You don't need to make excuses.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.180
This is exactly who he is.

08:02.250 --> 08:03.330
That's not true.

08:03.410 --> 08:04.860
I believe what he says here.

08:04.950 --> 08:06.550
He loves you and elizabeth.

08:06.660 --> 08:07.440
He...

08:07.550 --> 08:09.780
abandoned us without explanation,nora.

08:09.850 --> 08:12.400
That's not how normal people express love.

08:12.470 --> 08:16.130
Julia,I'm begging you-- I'm begging you-- he says he will contact you.

08:16.230 --> 08:20.240
When he does,please convince him to come home.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.160
I don't want him to come home.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.690
You don't mean that.

08:23.780 --> 08:26.010
I do.

08:26.110 --> 08:28.600
I'm done.

08:30.370 --> 08:32.500
I'm--I'm telling you that my brother is in trouble.

08:32.559 --> 08:34.570
Trouble?He's a fugitive.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.900
How long have you known about this?

08:35.970 --> 08:37.150
Kevin told us about it this morning.

08:37.390 --> 08:38.659
No,I'm not talking about the disappearing.

08:38.740 --> 08:39.929
I'm talking about the embezzling.

08:40.010 --> 08:42.510
I found out about it when you were in the hospital.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.370
And you didn't tell me?

08:43.450 --> 08:44.800
No.No,I didn't tell you.

08:44.890 --> 08:47.510
You weren't supposed to be under any kind of stress,and plus,

08:47.590 --> 08:49.800
we were-- we were just trying to,I don't know,figure it out.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.750
This isn't the kind of thing that you guys can solve with 75 phone conversations

08:52.840 --> 08:54.950
and a chicken dinner.I...

08:55.040 --> 08:59.000
well,now we just gotta figure out a way to minimize the damage.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.230
To my family or to your campaign?

09:02.310 --> 09:04.110
Both.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.270
Your brother is such an idiot.

09:05.350 --> 09:06.720
He'll get caught,he'll go to jail

09:06.830 --> 09:10.310
and make everybody's life a living hell without a thought for anybody around him.

09:10.430 --> 09:11.980
I may never see him again.

09:12.070 --> 09:13.930
Good.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.220
You wonder why I didn't tell you sooner?

09:18.460 --> 09:21.090
where are you going?

09:21.190 --> 09:23.080
I'm gonna go get some air.

09:29.580 --> 09:31.160
Hi,evan.

09:31.270 --> 09:33.150
-Hi. -Hi.

09:33.470 --> 09:35.330
Yeah,but just remember,don't touch.Just look,okay?

09:35.460 --> 09:36.710
I'm--I'm sorry.Have we met?

09:36.770 --> 09:38.450
I mean,I-I haven't been sleeping lately,

09:38.520 --> 09:40.840
so it's quite possible that we met and I don't remember.

09:40.910 --> 09:45.320
no.we met evan the other day with his grandmother,I think.

09:45.390 --> 09:48.480
Yeah,my height,brown hair,large bottle of hand sanitizer?

09:48.540 --> 09:50.420
That's her.yes.

09:50.540 --> 09:51.510
Uh,I'm alec.

09:51.610 --> 09:52.830
I'm kitty.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.370
-I know. -O are you?

09:54.490 --> 09:56.940
And that'S...that's ben.

09:57.200 --> 09:57.990
-BeN. -Ye

09:58.080 --> 10:00.060
-He's cute. -Thank you.

10:00.330 --> 10:02.900
You know,I used to watch your tv show,"red,white & blue.

10:03.740 --> 10:06.900
God,that seems-- that seems like a lifetime ago.

10:06.990 --> 10:08.480
I heard you're taking a break from politics,

10:08.540 --> 10:12.110
but somehow you found time to write a book about it.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.150
Oh,ye Ye.Did you read it?

10:14.250 --> 10:15.760
Actually,your mom told me.

10:15.860 --> 10:16.940
No,no,of course.

10:17.060 --> 10:18.200
Well,I--not that I-- no,I'm sorry.

10:18.280 --> 10:19.210
That was-- no,not that I wouldn't love to.

10:19.370 --> 10:21.550
I'm sure the book is brilliant,but,uh,you know,these days,

10:21.650 --> 10:25.930
unless it's for him or about him,en,uh,I just-- I really don't have the time.

10:26.010 --> 10:28.640
I totally,totally get that.

10:28.710 --> 10:30.280
look at you.You're a pro with the burping.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.260
You know what?It's not true.

10:31.350 --> 10:34.540
I'm--I'm the worst burper in the world.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.540
well,I was useless.

10:35.630 --> 10:37.600
But ben--he made it easy on me.He'd just vomit.

10:37.740 --> 10:39.640
Oh,that's--that's lucky.

10:39.750 --> 10:43.310
oh,um,um,what do I-- uh,okay,wait.Okay,

10:43.560 --> 10:45.800
It's okay.There you go.

10:45.990 --> 10:47.910
I'm sorry.Sorry.It's just-- no.

10:48.010 --> 10:49.520
It's--no,it's just that I'm hoping for a call.

10:49.600 --> 10:51.360
It's--it's okay.Listen,it was nice meeting you.

10:51.460 --> 10:52.400
It's my broth-- it's a long story.

10:52.490 --> 10:53.730
-It was nice meeting you. -it was nice to meet you,too.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.740
-Hello. -Hey.

10:55.830 --> 10:57.260
I'm sorry.Could you come home?

10:57.330 --> 10:59.170
Oh,robert.

10:59.370 --> 11:01.310
I'm-- I'm at--I'm at the park.

11:01.390 --> 11:03.360
Yeah,I know,but I-- I want to talk.

11:03.440 --> 11:07.020
Okay.Okay,sure.

11:11.050 --> 11:14.110
So I thought maybe you'd like me to take you out to dinner.

11:14.210 --> 11:14.910
This being hollywood,

11:15.000 --> 11:20.600
I found a guy who knows a guy who got us a table at that new pizzeria on melrose.

11:20.710 --> 11:22.180
I'm dying to go there.

11:22.260 --> 11:23.940
Good.***

11:24.200 --> 11:25.390
Oh,I-I don't know.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.640
The board meeting is this monday.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.380
It's the first one without tommy.

11:29.460 --> 11:31.050
Right.I wasn't talking about monday.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.390
I was talking about tonight.

11:32.480 --> 11:36.940
I-I know,but there are gonna be tons of questions about how to proceed from here,

11:37.010 --> 11:39.040
and I have to be prepared.

11:39.270 --> 11:41.010
All right.

11:41.140 --> 11:42.700
david-- no,holly.You're right.

11:42.790 --> 11:44.540
We can get pizza anytime.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.240
Don't act like that.

11:46.350 --> 11:48.070
Hey,I get it.

11:48.190 --> 11:49.940
Really.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.160
You run the place now.

11:51.250 --> 11:52.160
You deserve that.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.360
I've come around.

11:53.460 --> 11:55.890
Just do me a favor and remember the big picture.

11:55.970 --> 11:58.020
But that'shy I'm doing this.

11:58.130 --> 12:01.040
They might want to find someone to fill tommy's position,

12:01.130 --> 12:03.220
and I can't let that happen.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.340
I thought the big picture was you,me and rebecca.

12:06.430 --> 12:07.620
Look,my memory's not great,

12:07.710 --> 12:11.860
but I seem to recall you telling me that the reason you were doing all of this

12:11.930 --> 12:16.550
was so that we would have a shot as a family.

12:16.640 --> 12:17.650
You're right.

12:17.710 --> 12:20.830
This can wait.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.010
And whmeant at I said,david.

12:24.080 --> 12:27.810
You are my priority.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.210
You just said ojai was your priority.

12:30.310 --> 12:36.380
Well,I'd hate to pass up a $50 pizza.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.270
will you please just tell me what happened down there?

12:40.350 --> 12:44.230
Look,nothing.It--it doesn't matter.

12:44.350 --> 12:45.620
Was "it" wearing a bikini?

12:45.690 --> 12:47.640
Not that I'm in any position to care.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.910
Rebecca,I want you to care.

12:49.980 --> 12:52.680
All right,look,the truth is,what happened in mexico...

12:52.750 --> 12:54.390
is that I missed you.

12:54.460 --> 12:55.350
I mean it,so much.

12:55.440 --> 12:59.360
I mean,I was a wreck down there,and nothing felt right without you.

12:59.640 --> 13:03.170
You know,it--it's okay if you don't feel the same way-- no,it's not that.

13:03.260 --> 13:06.210
I mean,it's been hard being apart from you,too.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.530
That's good,right?I mean,you know,from--

13:08.640 --> 13:09.720
from my standpoint.

13:09.810 --> 13:11.350
Ye.I mean,look,it's not like I don't have my moments

13:11.440 --> 13:14.260
where I just wish I could forget everything and just...

13:14.330 --> 13:16.730
tell you how much I love you and I miss you-- so why don't you?

13:16.810 --> 13:19.030
Because nothing's changed.

13:19.110 --> 13:22.300
I mean,we can say that we're gonna keep our families out of it as much as we want,

13:22.370 --> 13:25.480
but it's impossible,and I just-- I can't go through that again.

13:25.560 --> 13:26.800
But things have changed,all right?

13:26.860 --> 13:28.860
Tommy's not at ojai anymore.

13:28.930 --> 13:31.630
You know,there's no--there's no conflict of interest there.

13:31.700 --> 13:33.610
Justin,come on.

13:33.680 --> 13:34.620
I mean,if tommy goes to jail,

13:34.700 --> 13:39.640
you think that your mom a-and saul and sarah are gonna forget how he got there?

13:39.730 --> 13:42.830
There's always gonna be resentment,and we're always gonna have to choose sides.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.240
But we don't have to.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.010
Rebecca,we learned our lesson.

13:47.080 --> 13:52.250
Can you just give this a chance?

13:52.330 --> 13:54.940
I mean,maybe we could...

13:55.030 --> 13:58.270
just hang out some more and kinda see where it goes.

13:58.450 --> 14:02.060
You know,uh,we'll take it slow.We'll...

14:02.160 --> 14:03.440
we'll see.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.230
Okay.

14:06.120 --> 14:10.850
Your mom invited me to the opening tomorrow.We could go.

14:12.370 --> 14:16.210
tommy's gonna be there.

14:16.280 --> 14:19.440
Yeah,I guess.

14:20.410 --> 14:24.330
I was just hoping that maybe we could hang out,just the two of us.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.110
Ye.Yeah,that's-- that's a better place to start.

14:27.190 --> 14:28.160
Ye

14:28.250 --> 14:29.630
And can I ask you a favor?

14:29.720 --> 14:32.560
Ryan's gonna be there tomorrow,and just be nice to him.

14:32.660 --> 14:34.890
He's going through some stuff right now.

14:34.970 --> 14:35.640
Are you kidding?

14:35.740 --> 14:37.300
Ryan-- new best friend ryan.

14:37.370 --> 14:41.270
-Okay,you don't have thao got far. -Okay.

14:46.950 --> 14:48.320
did you have fun at the park?

14:48.430 --> 14:51.120
Uh,ye.Ye

14:51.270 --> 14:53.250
Listen,I'm sorry about today.

14:53.340 --> 14:57.940
You told me this terrible thing about tommy,and I was just a jerk.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.150
And I can see from your expression that you agree with my assessment.

15:02.220 --> 15:03.840
Pretty much.

15:03.910 --> 15:05.540
Well,at least we're on the same page.

15:05.620 --> 15:06.820
Are we?

15:06.900 --> 15:09.460
Yeah,look,I want to be there and support you and the family.

15:09.530 --> 15:10.300
I already called nora.

15:10.380 --> 15:16.200
All we can really do is just hope that tommy changes his mind and--and comes home.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.620
Maybe he will.

15:17.710 --> 15:20.280
Yeah,maybe he will.

15:20.460 --> 15:24.970
Oh,um,I hear there's a scheduling conflict with shawna renaldo.

15:25.060 --> 15:27.080
Don't tell me.You're gonna be the new floor show.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.500
Listen,if I can't find tommy,I can at least give a speech.

15:29.630 --> 15:30.640
Maybe I'll sing it.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.420
Are--are you sure that you're up for that?

15:33.520 --> 15:36.290
Yeah,it's a charity event,not a 10k.

15:36.400 --> 15:37.920
All right.

15:38.150 --> 15:39.630
Scotty sent over the champagne.

15:39.710 --> 15:42.750
And the florist that he mentioned is donating the arrangements.

15:42.830 --> 15:43.450
Good.

15:43.530 --> 15:48.410
Okay,that is about it for the opening,and then it's on to the hard part.

15:48.490 --> 15:50.360
Maggie,you're gonna be a wonderful director.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.130
I hope I don't disappoint you.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.560
I've never run anything this big before.

15:54.660 --> 15:56.320
You're the mother of a cancer survivor.

15:56.400 --> 15:59.470
You've negotiated more bureaucracy than most people see in a lifetime,

15:59.540 --> 16:01.950
and you've run a family,

16:02.060 --> 16:04.210
which is exactly what I wanted the center to be-- a big,

16:04.290 --> 16:07.350
extended family for people who need it.

16:07.480 --> 16:11.460
I'll--I'll be there to support you any way I can.

16:11.540 --> 16:13.840
What about you?

16:13.930 --> 16:14.800
I'm not a psychiatrist,

16:14.880 --> 16:20.070
but your doodling does not look like the work of a woman who's just fulfilled a dream.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.890
Yikes.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.570
it does look a bit disturbed.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.490
Is there something I can do to help?

16:26.610 --> 16:29.960
Oh,no.No,it'S...

16:30.050 --> 16:32.720
it's nothing compared to what you've been through.

16:32.820 --> 16:35.320
Nora,olivia is all better.

16:35.420 --> 16:37.130
I've got this incredible new job.

16:37.210 --> 16:40.210
I feel like the luckiest person in t world.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.430
so tell me,what's going on?

16:42.520 --> 16:43.150
Oh,thank you.

16:43.230 --> 16:46.040
I just don't think there's anything anyone can really do to help.

16:46.120 --> 16:48.210
You're telling that to the wrong person.

16:48.300 --> 16:51.600
I happen to know there's always something you can do.

16:51.700 --> 16:53.200
Nora,please.Come on.Slow down.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.270
I'm not following you.

16:54.370 --> 16:57.430
The doctors told her there was no hope for her daughter.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.320
She found a radical new treatment.

16:59.410 --> 17:01.490
She got them to use the treatment,and it worked.

17:01.550 --> 17:03.160
Yes,yes,that I understand.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.609
But what does that have to do with tommy?

17:04.680 --> 17:07.410
We have to do something radical to save tommy.

17:07.490 --> 17:10.980
If maggie can have faith under those circumstances,so can we,for god sakes.

17:11.069 --> 17:12.800
Nora,tommy doesn't want to be saved.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.700
You don't know that,saul.

17:14.790 --> 17:16.369
Please help me.Please.

17:16.460 --> 17:19.109
Okay,what is this radical thing that we're supposed to do?

17:19.230 --> 17:23.940
Well,as luck would have it,I have invited ojai's board to my opening tomorrow.

17:24.030 --> 17:26.339
We have to convince them to go to the D.A.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.000
To get him to drop the charges against tommy.

17:29.070 --> 17:31.310
-Why would they do that? -I don't know.Loyalty.

17:31.390 --> 17:32.770
We've known them for 20 years.

17:32.850 --> 17:37.510
You have to understand that the board has a fiduciary responsibility to the company.

17:37.580 --> 17:40.260
That is where the loyalty lies.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.580
Y are you putting yourself through this?

17:42.660 --> 17:44.110
None of this is your fault.

17:44.190 --> 17:47.050
Saul,I hit him.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.800
The last time I saw him,I hit him.

17:49.890 --> 17:51.430
Nora...

17:51.520 --> 17:58.120
I have to do something.Please help me.Please.

17:58.240 --> 18:00.410
Please help me.

18:00.510 --> 18:02.870
I'll help you.

18:06.640 --> 18:11.890
because the trh is,places like this aren't born out of legislation or lobbying.

18:12.090 --> 18:13.660
They're from people.

18:13.740 --> 18:15.300
People with vision.

18:15.380 --> 18:16.860
Why is there so much press here?

18:16.980 --> 18:19.870
Something tells me they're not here to rave about my caue no est*n aqu?

18:19.950 --> 18:22.480
today we honor the vision of nora walker,

18:22.550 --> 18:24.360
whose dedication to community

18:24.440 --> 18:29.020
and to those in need led her to founding this center.Nora.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.580
I gotta hand it to her.She really did it.

18:33.670 --> 18:37.230
Yeah,I wish she was enjoying it more.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.360
I'd like to introduce another extraordinary woman.

18:41.450 --> 18:46.710
She faced her daughter olivia's diagnosis of leukemia with unwavering courage.

18:46.800 --> 18:52.690
She is the new executive director open doors-- maggie stephens.

18:53.970 --> 18:55.640
thank you.

19:04.210 --> 19:05.070
thank you.

19:05.190 --> 19:06.530
You should get some with your family.

19:06.600 --> 19:07.850
Oh,good idea.

19:07.950 --> 19:10.520
Oh,walkers.All walkers.

19:10.630 --> 19:11.330
Not all walkers.

19:11.420 --> 19:12.730
Everybody.

19:12.840 --> 19:14.760
Ryan,come on.Come on.

19:14.840 --> 19:15.750
Get or here.

19:15.960 --> 19:19.140
Ryan?What is this,soccer practice,just swap one kid in for the other?

19:19.220 --> 19:20.450
-Oh,be nice,justin. -Hey,man.

19:20.530 --> 19:22.600
Yeah,just be phony like kitty.

19:22.710 --> 19:24.280
I'm sorry.Was that your foot?

19:24.370 --> 19:26.020
Ye.Oh,that's a nice tie.

19:26.130 --> 19:27.310
Oh,ye.I'm sorry,man.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.580
I didn't have one,and your mom-- you know what?

19:28.660 --> 19:29.700
Actually,it,uh,it's fine.

19:29.780 --> 19:30.980
It looks-- it looks better on you.

19:31.060 --> 19:32.710
You should,uh,you should keep it.

19:32.790 --> 19:35.010
we look like we're doing "a chorus line," for goodness sakes.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.570
Scrunch in.Everybody.Scrunch.Scrunch behind.

19:37.650 --> 19:40.410
You know,scrunch together.We can't be all in front.

19:40.490 --> 19:42.860
-Okay.Here we go. -Ready?

19:43.030 --> 19:44.260
Okay,thank you.

19:45.760 --> 19:49.510
Thank you.Thank you.Thank you.Thank you.

19:49.680 --> 19:52.140
Okay,look,you ke harvey childs.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.720
He's--he's over there talking to that doctor.

19:53.810 --> 19:56.060
-Right,I saw him. -And--and I'm gonna find gail banks.

19:56.120 --> 19:58.220
-Okay,good luck. -Saul,we can do this.

19:58.370 --> 20:01.730
-Okay. -Go,go.

20:01.870 --> 20:04.710
look,the point of it is,there are so many people-- I mean,

20:04.800 --> 20:09.060
if you look at jim who is my good friend,a congressman and a democrat,

20:09.150 --> 20:12.040
there are ten different issues that we can get together on.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.920
But everybody always focuses on-- I'm--I'm sorry.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.360
Excuse me.Can I talk to you for a minute?

20:15.440 --> 20:17.010
Sure.One second.

20:17.830 --> 20:18.560
What's up?

20:18.700 --> 20:20.000
I thought that you were gonna take it easy.

20:20.110 --> 20:22.750
Oh,that?Oh,relax.That's fun for me.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.630
Do you know what happens when you tell somebody to relax?

20:24.700 --> 20:26.060
It actually has the opposite effect.

20:26.150 --> 20:27.640
It's scientifically proven.

20:27.800 --> 20:30.690
Okay,I'll finish up,and I'll come find you.

20:35.940 --> 20:36.670
Kev,kev,kev.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.270
I need you to go over there and be the communications director

20:39.350 --> 20:42.070
and--and shoo away all that press.He...

20:42.130 --> 20:45.060
-kevin? -What?

20:45.140 --> 20:46.230
Are you crying?

20:46.320 --> 20:47.860
No.I've just been talking to maggie stephens.

20:47.950 --> 20:51.250
Do you know the story of how she helped her daughter through chemotherapy?

20:51.510 --> 20:52.310
No.

20:52.390 --> 20:56.640
You wouldn't believe what she went through.You know...

20:56.750 --> 21:01.550
we really have to treasure every day,because life--ugh-- it's so fragile,you know?

21:01.640 --> 21:03.480
Carpe diem.

21:03.570 --> 21:04.760
Oh,right.

21:04.850 --> 21:05.590
Right,right.Okay,

21:05.680 --> 21:07.430
I'm--I'm gonna remember that.

21:07.500 --> 21:11.410
But right now,I need you to go over there and carpe robert away from the press.

21:11.480 --> 21:14.240
I mean,he--he didn't sign up for that.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.640
He's fine.He invited them all.

21:17.730 --> 21:18.390
No.

21:18.480 --> 21:19.250
Ye

21:19.350 --> 21:22.770
No,no.No,he invited them all for himself?no.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.500
I think that's the idea,ye

21:24.580 --> 21:27.200
It's his fir public appearance since his "minor" heart attack.

21:27.280 --> 21:27.990
Oh,unbelievable.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.250
No,that is-- that is truly unbelievable.

21:30.340 --> 21:33.330
This was supposed to be some big,altruistic gesture,

21:33.410 --> 21:35.640
and-- kit,you know what?

21:35.740 --> 21:36.880
You'll never get this day again.

21:36.950 --> 21:38.630
Do you really want to spend it bitter and angry?

21:38.700 --> 21:39.830
No.No.

21:39.900 --> 21:42.580
That's exactly what I'm trying not to do.

21:42.660 --> 21:43.200
Good.

21:43.290 --> 21:45.230
But what I am gonna do is I'm gonna go to the bar,

21:45.310 --> 21:48.450
and I'm gonna seize the day over there.

21:48.530 --> 21:50.310
Thank you.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.260
-Alec. -Right.

21:54.340 --> 21:55.390
From the pK.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.090
Of course.Of course,right.

21:57.180 --> 21:58.960
And you're not-- working the party?

21:59.050 --> 22:00.420
-No. -No,I'm sorry.

22:00.530 --> 22:01.580
That's my-- no,it's okay.

22:01.700 --> 22:03.420
I just saw the white and black-- white shirt,black pants.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.710
And I just said,"waiter.Waiter." Waiter's uniform.

22:05.860 --> 22:07.400
-I'm sorry. -It's okay.

22:07.490 --> 22:08.990
So what are you doing here?

22:09.270 --> 22:10.550
Uh,your mother invited me.

22:10.640 --> 22:16.530
Oh,so she just ropes in any random park goer and brings them to her events.

22:16.630 --> 22:20.130
well,actually,I've been active in cancer charities since my wife died.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.370
So I was glad to be included.

22:23.060 --> 22:25.600
No--oh,my gosh.I'm--I'm so sorry.

22:25.710 --> 22:26.460
Thank you.

22:26.560 --> 22:27.550
It was a while ago.

22:27.660 --> 22:29.500
Oh,god.

22:29.660 --> 22:34.090
and I hate the way that always brings conversation to a screeching halt.

22:34.180 --> 22:35.580
Oh,I'm sorry.I'm sorry.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.490
I'll--I'm--um-- it's not just you.

22:37.580 --> 22:39.650
It's--it's everyone.

22:39.750 --> 22:40.960
So...

22:41.070 --> 22:42.640
so,uh...

22:42.750 --> 22:44.130
your husband gave a good speech.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.480
Oh,oh,ye

22:45.590 --> 22:47.640
He's--he's,uh,he likes that.

22:47.740 --> 22:51.140
Oh,you know,we never got a chance to talk about evan's,

22:51.410 --> 22:53.990
you ow,his,uh,issues.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.420
You can say gas.

22:55.510 --> 22:57.210
Gas.

22:57.390 --> 22:59.590
no,I-I did.I tried everything.I tried over the lap.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.710
I tried over the shoulder.

23:00.790 --> 23:03.370
And it just,I don't know,it just doesn't seem to work.

23:03.470 --> 23:04.550
Do you ski?

23:04.640 --> 23:05.220
Ye

23:05.310 --> 23:09.060
Okay,I'm told that if you press their knees up into their chest-- oh,like a downhill tuck

23:09.170 --> 23:12.920
and maybe he'll win a gold medal someday.

23:13.050 --> 23:14.240
He's still not picking up.

23:14.340 --> 23:15.280
He's not going to,man.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.420
He's too busy catching waves.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.220
God,what re we thinking,taking him to baja?

23:18.290 --> 23:19.810
You know what?Stop.You sound like mom.

23:19.870 --> 23:20.620
I'm serious.

23:20.700 --> 23:21.430
Tommy knew what he was doing.

23:21.520 --> 23:22.830
Why didn't we just leave him alone?

23:22.940 --> 23:24.200
Because he was gonna lose.

23:24.270 --> 23:25.760
You know what?We should be down there looking for him.

23:25.830 --> 23:27.390
And what,if we found him,he's gonna come home with us?

23:27.610 --> 23:29.120
Kevin,he left his wife and kid.

23:29.210 --> 23:30.040
You know what?

23:30.150 --> 23:31.270
If you want to be angry at him,go ahead.

23:31.340 --> 23:34.650
I can't be,not--not right now.

23:34.850 --> 23:37.490
you know what?Good for you.

23:48.610 --> 23:49.610
Hey.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.660
Hey.What's up?

23:50.740 --> 23:52.520
What are you doing out here?

23:52.640 --> 23:54.580
Just,uh,just chillin'.

23:54.830 --> 23:57.520
I'm usually not a big wine drinker,but this is really,really good.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.560
You should try some.

23:59.660 --> 24:00.550
I'm sorry,man.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.320
I totally forgot.

24:01.410 --> 24:04.750
Yeah,you know,it's-- it's no big deal.Don't worry about it.

24:04.820 --> 24:08.690
Look,I'm--I'm sorry if I was a little weird over at rebecca'S.

24:08.770 --> 24:11.290
Well,for the record,man,you don't need to be.We're just friends.

24:11.360 --> 24:12.430
I know.

24:12.530 --> 24:14.110
She told me.

24:14.210 --> 24:15.850
She's a really cool person.

24:15.930 --> 24:20.330
You know,I can--I can see why you were so bummed when she broke up with you.

24:20.420 --> 24:23.320
Actually,I think we're,uh,we're getting back together.

24:24.950 --> 24:26.360
-Really?That's great. -Ye

24:26.420 --> 24:27.590
Good.

24:27.660 --> 24:28.710
Is she here?I mean,

24:28.780 --> 24:29.810
she said she was invited.

24:29.890 --> 24:33.490
It's,uh,you know,it's complicated.

24:33.590 --> 24:36.480
She doesn't know about tommy,huh?

24:36.580 --> 24:37.270
I mean,it makes sense.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.050
Her mom is the prosecution,right?

24:39.490 --> 24:40.580
Don't-- don't worry about it.

24:40.670 --> 24:41.340
Oh,I'm not worried.

24:41.430 --> 24:45.800
I just-- I thought the whole lying thing was why you guys broke up in the first place.

24:45.890 --> 24:46.850
Excuse me?

24:46.930 --> 24:47.530
I get it,man.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.040
You have to put your brother first.

24:49.130 --> 24:49.960
I mean,you wouldn't want the D.A.

24:50.060 --> 24:51.300
Knowing about all this-- you know what?

24:51.380 --> 24:52.210
Leave my brother out of this.

24:52.270 --> 24:53.770
And while you're at it,leave rebecca out of it,too.

24:53.850 --> 24:54.660
Hey,take it easy,man.

24:54.740 --> 24:56.470
No,what--what do you want?

24:56.550 --> 24:57.430
Seriously,what do you want?

24:57.500 --> 24:59.800
I mean,you move into our house,you're living off our mom.

24:59.870 --> 25:01.000
Oh,I'm sorry.I forgot.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.260
That's youjob.

25:03.350 --> 25:04.980
You know what?Just because our parents slept together

25:05.170 --> 25:06.700
does notean you belong here.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.260
Belong?

25:08.370 --> 25:12.160
Is that why you think I came here?

25:12.260 --> 25:15.980
Will you tell your mom I found my own ride home?

25:21.240 --> 25:23.560
Rvey,the rest of the boardlistens to you.

25:23.630 --> 25:26.030
If you take the lead on this,the others are gonna follow.

25:26.100 --> 25:28.650
Yeah,but we can't ignore the fact h thateme was bezzling the company.

25:28.720 --> 25:32.620
Yeah,but,harvey,ojai stands nothing to gain if this goes to trial.

25:32.750 --> 25:33.640
Hi.

25:33.720 --> 25:34.690
Mind if I join you?

25:34.770 --> 25:36.950
What,are you two ganging up on me?

25:37.020 --> 25:40.070
Well,harvey,if that's what it takes.

25:43.610 --> 25:44.740
okay,what are mom and saul up to?

25:44.810 --> 25:47.920
I've just seen them sucking up to harvey childs,and I know mom hates him.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.350
They're on a mission to get tommy's charges dropped.

25:50.440 --> 25:52.650
They want the board to go to the D.A.

25:52.730 --> 25:54.360
-Oh,well,that's the wrong road to go down. -What?

25:54.450 --> 25:57.430
You know,when's mom gonna realize,this family's hold on ojai foods,it's over.

25:57.510 --> 25:59.770
How can you y that so glibly?

25:59.860 --> 26:02.430
It's not glib.It's the truth.

26:02.500 --> 26:05.390
Yeah,well,I'm not sure I can live with that.

26:05.460 --> 26:07.780
It's over,sar

26:07.880 --> 26:09.740
Enough.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.150
ryan,hey.How's the opening?

26:16.220 --> 26:17.900
Actually,I'm at nora'S.

26:17.980 --> 26:18.740
That was quick.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.940
Yeah,well,I wasn't feeling very welcomed.

26:21.270 --> 26:22.610
Oh,no.What happened?

26:23.790 --> 26:26.440
Look,I know you and justin are getting back together...

26:26.540 --> 26:28.790
uh,we're not back together.

26:28.890 --> 26:30.390
He seems to think differently about that.

26:30.470 --> 26:33.400
Either way,he made it pretty clear that he doesn't want me near you.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.270
Oh,my god.What is wrong with him?

26:35.350 --> 26:37.920
I think the fact that I exist pisses him off.

26:38.090 --> 26:40.520
Plus,he's probably just a little worked up about tommy.

26:40.580 --> 26:42.510
Wait,what about tommy?

26:42.610 --> 26:44.680
What,he didn't tell you?

26:44.770 --> 26:47.430
Tell me what?

26:47.520 --> 26:48.840
Tommy took off.

26:48.920 --> 26:50.420
I think he's somewhere in mexico.

26:50.510 --> 26:53.240
Yeah,but justin said that he was gonna be there today.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.270
Well,you should probably talk to him about that.

26:55.330 --> 26:56.540
Yeah,I will.

26:57.050 --> 26:59.470
but listen,whatever he said about staying away from me?

26:59.540 --> 27:01.180
Forget it.We're friends.

27:01.270 --> 27:03.730
He doesn't have a say in that.

27:03.800 --> 27:05.400
I was hoping you'd say that.

27:05.470 --> 27:06.620
Tommy,it's me again.

27:06.690 --> 27:10.970
Listen,I know you don't want to talk to any of us,but I want to talk to you.

27:11.070 --> 27:12.320
Tommy,you'rmy brother.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.600
I love you.

27:13.670 --> 27:15.870
But you gotta come home.

27:15.930 --> 27:16.450
So what?

27:16.550 --> 27:17.810
You screwed up,you know?

27:17.910 --> 27:21.470
But we can get through this,together.

27:21.570 --> 27:23.520
Nothing else matters...

27:23.610 --> 27:24.170
okay?

27:24.250 --> 27:26.900
I-I don't even care about what happens to ojai anymore.

27:26.980 --> 27:29.740
I just--I want you to come-- I'm sorry.

27:29.820 --> 27:32.360
The voice mail box you are trying to reach is full.

27:32.460 --> 27:34.750
Please try again later.

27:38.070 --> 27:40.350
need this?

27:40.660 --> 27:43.920
How did you kn I know.

27:44.460 --> 27:47.550
******.

27:47.620 --> 27:50.010
i know.I heard.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.730
How could he do this?

27:51.860 --> 27:55.530
I don't know,s

27:58.110 --> 27:59.370
Did you mean what you said,though?

27:59.480 --> 28:00.720
What about?

28:00.820 --> 28:02.860
About not caring whether we lose ojai?

28:02.950 --> 28:04.120
I don't know.

28:04.220 --> 28:04.750
Sarah,come on.

28:04.840 --> 28:07.520
You and tommy practically grew up at that place.

28:07.610 --> 28:09.990
Dad always said that you had the company in your blood.

28:10.070 --> 28:11.510
It's hard for me.

28:11.620 --> 28:14.910
I can't imagine what it's like for you to watch this whole thing slip away.

28:15.010 --> 28:15.870
Are you trying to cheer me up?

28:15.950 --> 28:18.870
-Cause it's not really working. -Sarah,I'm just trying to be real here.

28:18.950 --> 28:23.690
Of course I care.

28:25.450 --> 28:32.220
oh,tell jocelyn to pass the kebabs,or they sit on the buffet and get cold.

28:32.330 --> 28:34.530
scotty,could I get a glass of water?

28:34.600 --> 28:36.860
Yeah,su-- are you all right?

28:36.960 --> 28:37.720
Yeah,I'm fine.

28:37.780 --> 28:40.210
Well,you don't look fine.

28:40.470 --> 28:43.350
I think it's my heart medication.It makes me a little...

28:43.440 --> 28:44.180
-light-headed. -Oh,my god.

28:44.260 --> 28:46.870
You need to sit down.

28:48.980 --> 28:49.900
Here.

28:50.180 --> 28:51.470
It'll pass.

28:51.570 --> 28:54.620
-Well,drink that. -Thanks.

28:56.330 --> 28:57.400
Craziest park parent?

28:57.510 --> 28:59.410
Yeah,that's--that's a no-brainer.

28:59.500 --> 29:00.800
It's donna kabrel.

29:00.900 --> 29:01.770
-Have you met her? -Wait a minute.

29:01.860 --> 29:05.370
She's-- she's not the one who makes her kid wear those,um,those gloves?

29:05.470 --> 29:06.780
yes.Yes,you have met her.

29:06.850 --> 29:10.380
Tell me,do you think that's about germs or do you think that's a fashion statement?

29:10.460 --> 29:13.080
No,no,it's even worse.

29:13.170 --> 29:14.520
they're grippy gloves.

29:14.630 --> 29:16.490
Grippy gloves?

29:16.580 --> 29:18.010
What--what are grippy gloves?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.420
To cling better to the jungle gym.

29:19.610 --> 29:21.590
Yeah,she also makes her wear grippy shoes.

29:21.680 --> 29:22.580
-No way. -Yes way.

29:22.670 --> 29:25.650
No,you're kiddingE.You know,that's actually-- kitty,come quick.

29:25.970 --> 29:26.890
Let's go.

29:26.980 --> 29:28.100
What's wrong?

29:28.200 --> 29:31.510
Excuse me.What--what happened?

29:32.000 --> 29:33.900
What happened?Hey,are you okay?

29:33.990 --> 29:35.090
I got a little light-headed.

29:35.180 --> 29:36.560
This is dr. Flackett.

29:36.650 --> 29:39.140
Did he tell you that he had a bypass surgery about a month ago?

29:39.230 --> 29:41.090
I'm not sure that this has anything to do with that.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.790
Well,now let's let someone with a medical degree decide that.

29:43.860 --> 29:45.710
Your blood pressure's still elevated,senator.

29:45.800 --> 29:46.430
You need to go to the hospital.

29:46.530 --> 29:47.560
I'll call an ambulance.

29:47.660 --> 29:48.510
Wait,h-hold on.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.810
I may have,you know,shaken too many hands out there,but let's not get hysterical.

29:51.900 --> 29:53.260
Hysterical?Nobody's hysterical,robert.

29:53.350 --> 29:55.390
-She's a doctor. -She's a pediatrician.

29:55.470 --> 29:58.720
Senator,I'm happy to call your cardiologist and let him or her know where you're headed,

29:58.810 --> 30:00.410
but you need to go.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.880
Does this mean I can call an ambulance now?

30:01.970 --> 30:04.820
-Yes. -No ambulance,no.

30:04.900 --> 30:07.190
We'll drive.

30:09.590 --> 30:11.160
you're angry?

30:11.250 --> 30:12.260
I'm not angry.

30:12.350 --> 30:16.030
Come on.You barely said anything the entire ride home.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.090
I know that you warned me to take it easy,and I didn'T.

30:18.160 --> 30:21.360
We just spent six hours in a hospital getting every check known to mankind,

30:21.550 --> 30:24.070
but I--I'm fine.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.140
My numbers are good.

30:25.210 --> 30:26.920
My blood pressure's lower than it's ever been.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.220
Yeah,that's great,honey.

30:30.300 --> 30:31.740
Is this about tommy?

30:31.820 --> 30:33.750
Is that what's-- I don't want to talk about tommy,okay?

30:33.820 --> 30:35.930
-Please. -What do you want to talk about?

30:36.010 --> 30:38.720
Come on.Let's--let's have it out.Let's fight.

30:38.790 --> 30:40.740
I want to fight.I want to have the fight.

30:40.820 --> 30:42.430
We've had the fight a million times,robert.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.340
-It never does any good. -Well,I don't get it.

30:44.400 --> 30:45.850
I-I stepped in for you mother today.

30:45.900 --> 30:48.590
It went really well-- no,no,you know what?You didn't step in.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.340
You were just making sure that the first story

30:50.420 --> 30:53.410
that hit the papers after your heart attack made you look good and noble.

30:53.490 --> 30:56.500
And I got the center ten times more attention than it ever would've had.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.670
So what is the problem with that?

30:58.760 --> 31:00.610
nothing.

31:00.690 --> 31:02.740
Nothing.You're absolutely right.

31:02.810 --> 31:08.390
Sorr it was.It was good for everybY.

31:09.900 --> 31:13.010
I don't know what you want from me anymore.

31:13.100 --> 31:15.340
I don't want anything.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.220
I just want to go to bed.

31:25.500 --> 31:27.220
How was the opening?

31:27.310 --> 31:28.620
Uh,you know,it was good.

31:28.690 --> 31:29.740
You didn't miss much.

31:29.830 --> 31:30.760
Yeah?

31:31.100 --> 31:34.180
I know why you didn't want me to go.

31:34.330 --> 31:36.790
You lied to me about tommy.

31:36.860 --> 31:38.570
What,did ryan tell you that?

31:38.650 --> 31:42.110
He's my friend,and by the way,you have no right to tell him to stay away from me.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.050
Don't you see what he's doing?He's trying to get between us.

31:44.140 --> 31:45.780
This has nothing to do with him.

31:45.870 --> 31:47.250
You lied to me.

31:47.330 --> 31:48.750
This iexactly why we could never work.

31:48.820 --> 31:49.760
You always put your family first.

31:49.830 --> 31:51.460
Look,I didn't put my family first,all right?

31:51.540 --> 31:52.660
I took you out of it.

31:52.730 --> 31:54.940
Only because you didn't want me to tell my mom about tommy.

31:55.020 --> 31:56.390
We're trying to buy him time,rebecca.

31:56.470 --> 31:59.180
If the judge were to find-- I don't want to hear it,justin.

31:59.260 --> 32:00.790
This is exactly what I was talking about.

32:00.870 --> 32:02.460
I can't do this again.

32:02.550 --> 32:06.860
So what,you're just gonna give up on us?

32:08.490 --> 32:10.960
Well...

32:11.150 --> 32:13.020
I shoulda seen that coming.

32:13.100 --> 32:16.110
We both should have.

32:27.610 --> 32:30.840
No.No,that can't be right.

32:30.930 --> 32:32.850
When did it happen?

32:32.930 --> 32:37.430
Well,I don't see that I have much choice.

32:37.500 --> 32:38.160
Fine.

32:38.220 --> 32:41.220
I'll see you at the meeting.

32:41.310 --> 32:43.550
What?

32:44.430 --> 32:47.000
How could they be so heartless?

32:47.090 --> 32:49.310
I don't know.

32:50.010 --> 32:53.000
You did a lot of good for a lot of people today,sis.

32:55.180 --> 32:58.320
Yes,yes,yes.But...

32:58.400 --> 33:01.000
I realized there's more than one way to lose a child.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.600
Oh,you haven't lost him.

33:02.680 --> 33:03.620
He knows youove him.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.570
He'll be back.

33:05.660 --> 33:09.260
Then why doesn't he call?He must know how wried we all are.

33:09.350 --> 33:10.280
mom!

33:10.360 --> 33:11.850
In here.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.430
Oh,good.You're up.

33:13.510 --> 33:14.590
Well,our eyes are open.

33:14.670 --> 33:16.750
I don't know if we're up.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.280
Well,I've got some news that's gonna get your blood moving.

33:19.410 --> 33:21.070
What?

33:21.400 --> 33:23.830
-I'm going back to ojai - what?

33:23.900 --> 33:26.020
I'm replacing tommy as president.

33:26.130 --> 33:28.450
-When did this happen? -Forget when.What about why?

33:28.520 --> 33:31.110
I-I called erydy on the board,

33:31.200 --> 33:37.410
and I said that I'm not gonna let my father's company slip away from the family without a fight.

33:37.480 --> 33:38.930
-They agreed. -Oh,my god.

33:39.010 --> 33:40.390
What are you gonna do about greenatopia?

33:40.460 --> 33:41.930
I-I don't know.I haven't figured it out.

33:42.010 --> 33:45.750
I'm just-- I'm taking this one life-altering step at a me.

33:45.820 --> 33:47.510
What are you gonna do about holly?

33:47.610 --> 33:50.770
Well,harvey called her,so she knows.

33:50.830 --> 33:54.120
What's she gonna do,put a hit on me?

33:54.320 --> 33:56.880
sweetheart,please,don't be doing this to be a martyr.

33:56.990 --> 34:00.410
Oh,mom.It's not like that.I promise.

34:00.490 --> 34:04.510
Tommy risked everything to keep our company in our family's hands.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.870
He just--he went about it the wrong way.

34:06.950 --> 34:07.790
Now it's my turn.

34:07.850 --> 34:08.600
I have to try.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.810
And I'm not doing it for anybody else.

34:10.889 --> 34:14.270
There's too much of me in that company just to let it go.

34:14.370 --> 34:15.820
I want to honor that.

34:15.889 --> 34:17.900
Now we have to figure out what to do about tommy.

34:17.969 --> 34:20.340
Well-- don't count on the board dropping the charges.

34:20.429 --> 34:22.190
We tried that tonight.We failed.

34:22.260 --> 34:25.920
Well,as a matter of fact,I spoke to harvey,

34:25.989 --> 34:30.469
and I told him why I thought it was bad for business to keep the case going.

34:30.540 --> 34:31.949
He said he'd think about it.

34:32.060 --> 34:34.110
-Oh,sarah,sarah! -No,no,no,mom.

34:34.190 --> 34:36.540
no panting,no bobbing,okay?

34:36.620 --> 34:38.790
-Mom,stop clapping. -All right.

34:38.840 --> 34:41.639
We don't know everything yet.It's still with the D.A.

34:41.710 --> 34:44.219
It's probably not gonna work.

34:44.330 --> 34:48.230
that's what the doctors said to maggie stephens.

34:48.230 --> 34:50.550
-What is she talking about? -Hope.

34:50.620 --> 34:54.080
She's talking about hope.

34:55.650 --> 35:01.950
Well,I--I'd like to thank you all for your trust and your continued confidence.

35:02.010 --> 35:04.100
Well,moving on,uh,the next,uh,

35:04.170 --> 35:09.080
bit of business on the agenda-- my brother's legal matter.

35:09.170 --> 35:13.020
Now I know this has been difficult for everybody involved.

35:13.090 --> 35:15.560
But we have a chance today to put it behind us.

35:15.640 --> 35:17.210
With that in mind,I'd like to suggest

35:17.270 --> 35:21.690
that we approach the district attorney about having the charges dropped.

35:21.760 --> 35:25.630
Actually,sarah,I know we spoke last night,but in the light of day,

35:25.700 --> 35:28.360
the board still has reservations.

35:28.440 --> 35:31.390
Yeah,we just don't think it's appropriate for us to get involved.

35:31.460 --> 35:33.830
And I completely respect that position.

35:33.900 --> 35:36.950
There is no doubt my brother tommy's culpable.

35:37.050 --> 35:40.110
But restitution has been made.

35:40.230 --> 35:44.610
And I just don't think it's in our best interests to have this matter go public.

35:44.700 --> 35:45.920
Yes,yes,sarah is right.

35:45.990 --> 35:49.520
This--this could do serious damage to the ojai name.

35:49.610 --> 35:52.850
You know,with all due respect,nora,wenow where you stand.

35:52.910 --> 35:55.930
I just don't see the harm if we-- you don't?

35:56.020 --> 35:58.450
How would it look to our employees,our clients?

35:58.520 --> 36:04.550
And how would it look if we destroyed the founder's son?

36:04.610 --> 36:11.530
Now I realize that I set this io motn,but the danger to ojai has passed.

36:11.600 --> 36:14.590
We need to move past this,too.

36:14.670 --> 36:17.180
Well,I have to say,I'm surprised to hear you say that.

36:17.250 --> 36:18.590
Why?

36:18.680 --> 36:21.290
William walker created a family business.

36:21.370 --> 36:24.370
This is about family.

36:24.460 --> 36:28.210
I intend to vote with my new partner.

36:28.290 --> 36:32.810
And I'm also going to withdraw my cooperation as a witness.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.600
How you proceed as a board...

36:35.700 --> 36:38.740
is up to you.

36:45.960 --> 36:50.110
well,uh,should we put it to a vote?

36:53.350 --> 36:55.560
May I ask why?

36:55.670 --> 36:58.890
I guess that means you got the vote.

37:01.630 --> 37:03.870
Holly,I came to you a couple of o,s ag

37:03.940 --> 37:07.060
and I implored you to have the charges against tommy dropped.

37:07.130 --> 37:08.650
You refused.

37:08.730 --> 37:10.710
So what's changed?

37:11.060 --> 37:13.450
You're here now.

37:13.530 --> 37:15.900
We need to work together.

37:15.980 --> 37:19.070
So you're willing to put everything that's happened behind us?

37:19.150 --> 37:23.390
Sarah,I always said that I would put ojai first.

37:23.470 --> 37:26.880
I did it with tommy,and I'll do it with you.

37:26.960 --> 37:31.480
I'm just thinking about the bigger picture.

37:31.760 --> 37:34.320
Welcome back.

37:36.610 --> 37:39.090
Thank you.

37:45.660 --> 37:47.620
this is useless.There's too much stuff.

37:47.690 --> 37:50.830
Oh,come on.We're making progress.

37:53.150 --> 37:54.490
Thanks for doing this.

37:54.570 --> 37:58.370
Yeah,well,I'm tired of secrets.

37:59.690 --> 38:02.360
I have william's expense reports from august and september,

38:02.440 --> 38:08.360
and I'm not seeing any phone calls to bakersfield,no conferences he went to.

38:08.450 --> 38:09.700
Whoever filed this needs to be fired.

38:09.780 --> 38:12.370
It says "expense reports," and it's filled with shipping invoices.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.190
Wait,hold on a second.

38:14.250 --> 38:17.400
What--what day did your mom get in the accident?

38:17.450 --> 38:20.500
October 17th.Why?

38:22.400 --> 38:23.580
he was in reno.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.410
I guess like your mom.

38:25.480 --> 38:29.730
This is a hotel bill from october 16th.

38:32.770 --> 38:33.640
I knew it.

38:33.710 --> 38:35.200
No.I-I mean,you don't know what went on.

38:35.290 --> 38:36.810
I think it's pretty obvious,isn't it?

38:36.880 --> 38:38.750
They spent the night together in a hotel...

38:38.820 --> 38:39.620
no,no.It--that--

38:39.730 --> 38:43.230
and she killed herself the very next day.

38:43.330 --> 38:46.230
It had to be him.

38:46.730 --> 38:49.320
That son of a bitch killed my mother.

38:49.410 --> 38:52.720
Ryan,I don'T...

38:53.060 --> 38:56.060
-I have to go. -You don'T...

39:01.220 --> 39:02.210
how's the burping coming?

39:03.120 --> 39:04.150
Well,we tried it.

39:04.380 --> 39:07.010
And,uh,we're still as gassy as ever.

39:07.090 --> 39:08.490
Hey,ben.

39:09.160 --> 39:10.140
okay.

39:10.260 --> 39:11.430
I have one other idea.

39:11.500 --> 39:12.700
Let me-- you know what,alec?

39:12.810 --> 39:16.030
Can we just not talk about burping today?

39:16.110 --> 39:17.390
YeYeah,I'm sorry.

39:17.470 --> 39:18.850
I didn't mean-- no,no,no,don't be sorry.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.570
No,no,it's me.I'm just--I...

39:21.660 --> 39:23.200
I don't--I just...

39:23.270 --> 39:24.850
I have a lot on my mind,that's all.

39:24.920 --> 39:27.150
I'm a good listener.

39:27.240 --> 39:34.010
Yeah,and ben-- he's gonna be flinging sand at the other children for at least an hour,so...

39:34.090 --> 39:36.090
I'm all yours.

39:36.810 --> 39:37.820
come on.

39:37.910 --> 39:41.020
All right.All right.Well,

39:41.100 --> 39:43.410
okay.Then I'll...

39:43.490 --> 39:44.860
it's my brother.

39:44.950 --> 39:46.810
He's,uh,you know,no-- nobody knows where he is.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.050
So now we're just waiting for him to call.

39:49.140 --> 39:53.150
Oh,my god,sar.I am...so sorry.

39:53.230 --> 39:56.090
Yeah,but-- but you don't have to leave greenatopia,right?

39:56.150 --> 39:58.960
I mean,selfishly-- we can't do this without you.

39:59.030 --> 39:59.720
Yes,you can.

39:59.790 --> 40:02.320
When the site crashed,you guys handled it brilliantly.

40:02.390 --> 40:04.010
Right,but what about when there's a real crisis?

40:04.080 --> 40:06.440
-That was nothing. -And there'll be one.

40:06.530 --> 40:09.040
But I wouldn't leave if i didn't think you could do it.

40:09.120 --> 40:10.580
Me andim?Are you kidding me?

40:10.650 --> 40:14.600
Before you,we were living in,like,a low-rent sty,drinking beer in the shower.

40:14.660 --> 40:16.000
I got a lot of good ideas that way.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.020
You did.

40:17.110 --> 40:19.760
Listen,it doesn't change the facts.

40:19.850 --> 40:21.590
This company was your idea.

40:21.670 --> 40:25.170
Now you're hiring employees,you're developing new clients.

40:25.250 --> 40:28.080
Everything that you've built here,it's yours.

40:28.160 --> 40:29.110
Like...

40:29.180 --> 40:31.330
ojai belongs to you.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.160
Ye

40:36.480 --> 40:37.250
nora.

40:37.360 --> 40:37.940
I don't need to come in.

40:38.020 --> 40:41.320
I just wanted to tell you,the D.A.'S dropping the charges.

40:41.470 --> 40:42.580
They are?

40:42.670 --> 40:44.070
Ye

40:44.180 --> 40:45.780
There's no excuse for what he did.

40:45.870 --> 40:48.810
So whatever you have to do,julia,you should do.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.950
I'm not here to appeal to you on behalf of tommy.

40:51.020 --> 40:53.370
But you're a mother,so you understand,

40:53.470 --> 40:58.480
there is no amount of anger that can make me stop loving him.

40:58.570 --> 41:01.270
So if he calls...

41:01.520 --> 41:06.230
yes,I'll tell him it's okay to come home....

41:10.790 --> 41:12.290
you know what?

41:12.380 --> 41:15.070
It was easier being angry at him.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.640
Now I wish I could just talk to him.

41:16.750 --> 41:18.440
Ye

41:20.160 --> 41:23.360
Rememb that night on the beach where all he talked about was starting over?

41:23.440 --> 41:25.240
A clean slate?

41:25.330 --> 41:26.370
I know.

41:26.460 --> 41:29.460
I want that.

41:30.330 --> 41:32.690
We all do.

41:33.620 --> 41:37.410
Here we are you think he's gonna come back?

41:38.840 --> 41:44.660
I don't know.

00:00.500 --> 00:13.000
