WEBVTT

00:02.534 --> 00:04.136
Before we sign off, I want to send

00:04.137 --> 00:06.726
good wishes to Mets pitcher Matt Harvey,

00:06.727 --> 00:08.650
out for the season with a bad shoulder.

00:08.651 --> 00:11.152
Been there, buddy... it's painful.

00:11.153 --> 00:14.021
Oscar, you sprained
yours buttering a pancake.

00:14.022 --> 00:16.222
That butter was right out of the fridge.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.757
It was like a brick!

00:19.493 --> 00:21.529
All right, that's our
show. I'm Oscar Madison.

00:21.530 --> 00:24.430
And I'm Dani D, your
lady-o on the radio.

00:25.166 --> 00:26.933
Sounded so cute in the shower.

00:27.835 --> 00:29.503
What a show!

00:29.504 --> 00:31.647
I wish I could go back in
time and listen to it again.

00:31.648 --> 00:33.174
Well, they replay it at 5:00.

00:33.175 --> 00:34.595
Yeah, one of my kids has a thing.

00:35.709 --> 00:37.044
So, who's your favorite agent?

00:37.045 --> 00:38.268
Ooh, you're my favorite agent.

00:38.269 --> 00:40.181
What did I win?

00:40.182 --> 00:42.383
Well, I've been talking to
the executives about you,

00:42.384 --> 00:44.705
and they know that you're more
than just Oscar's assistant.

00:44.706 --> 00:46.474
You're on the air,
you're screening calls,

00:46.475 --> 00:48.789
and they think it's time
for you to be rewarded.

00:48.790 --> 00:51.058
Am I getting a cookie cake?

00:51.059 --> 00:52.760
No!

00:52.761 --> 00:54.242
They decided to make you the producer

00:54.243 --> 00:55.343
of the Oscar Madison Show!

00:55.344 --> 00:57.631
Oh, Teddy!

00:57.632 --> 00:59.266
Hold the phone.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.968
There will be no cake?

01:00.969 --> 01:02.903
Oscar, did you know about this?

01:02.904 --> 01:04.238
Yeah, Teddy gave me the heads-up.

01:04.239 --> 01:05.072
Congratulations.

01:05.072 --> 01:06.140
Oh, thank you.

01:06.141 --> 01:08.042
Ah, that's my buttering arm!

01:08.043 --> 01:10.044
You're going to have
more responsibilities...

01:10.045 --> 01:12.046
booking guests, dealing
with the sponsors...

01:12.047 --> 01:13.714
Oh, I've got to call my family.

01:13.715 --> 01:15.416
My mom is going to be so proud,

01:15.417 --> 01:17.218
and my sister's going to be so jealous.

01:17.219 --> 01:18.484
Suck it, Denise!

01:21.222 --> 01:23.285
Oh, shoot, I should have
asked Dani for some coffee.

01:23.286 --> 01:24.625
Dani! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:24.626 --> 01:25.993
She's not an assistant anymore.

01:25.994 --> 01:27.294
She's a producer.

01:27.295 --> 01:29.263
Well, that's just a title, right?

01:29.264 --> 01:31.265
I don't have to do my
own stuff now, do I?

01:31.266 --> 01:34.168
I don't know how to cook coffee.

01:34.169 --> 01:36.070
There's money in the budget

01:36.071 --> 01:37.838
to hire a new assistant for both of you.

01:37.839 --> 01:39.782
I don't want a new
assistant... Dani was perfect.

01:39.783 --> 01:41.775
Quit being a baby... Dani's earned this.

01:41.776 --> 01:43.277
I mean, she put up with your nonsense

01:43.278 --> 01:44.781
and managed to stay sweet and humble.

01:44.782 --> 01:46.413
And another thing, Denise.

01:46.414 --> 01:48.682
You remember in '87 when
you called me Dani the Dummy?

01:48.683 --> 01:51.417
Uh-huh, who's the dummy now?

01:53.177 --> 01:56.723
<font color="#33FF00">Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

01:56.793 --> 01:58.524
We've got a lot of applicants.

01:58.525 --> 02:01.027
Gwyneth Paltrow wants
to be our assistant?

02:01.028 --> 02:03.362
That's People magazine.

02:06.333 --> 02:08.201
Guess who just bought three new dresses?

02:08.202 --> 02:10.402
This should be easier.

02:13.222 --> 02:15.324
It's so cute you go shopping together.

02:15.325 --> 02:17.059
I told him he didn't have to come.

02:17.060 --> 02:19.161
Oh, I wanted to.

02:19.162 --> 02:21.664
Someone thinks overalls
are still in fashion.

02:21.665 --> 02:23.599
I'm going to grab a glass of water.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.035
Okay, hurry back, love.

02:26.036 --> 02:27.703
Oh, my God, did you see that?

02:27.704 --> 02:29.171
See what?

02:29.172 --> 02:31.407
Emily... she's so
distant and out of sorts.

02:31.408 --> 02:32.678
When she came back from London,

02:32.679 --> 02:34.702
I thought we would fall
right back into our groove.

02:34.703 --> 02:36.178
But no, no... something is off.

02:36.179 --> 02:37.646
She seems fine to me.

02:37.647 --> 02:39.849
I actually decided to make some tea.

02:39.850 --> 02:40.850
Does anybody want some?

02:40.851 --> 02:42.217
- None for me, thanks.
- Oh.

02:43.686 --> 02:45.353
You had to see it that time!

02:47.223 --> 02:49.625
Well, I know what will jolt
her out of her malaise...

02:49.626 --> 02:53.295
a patented night of Felix
Unger romantic enchantment.

02:54.531 --> 02:55.834
Ooh, that's our first applicant.

02:55.835 --> 02:56.799
It's so exciting.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.300
Can't we just use this guy?

02:58.301 --> 03:00.603
His resume is long, and he's bilingual.

03:00.604 --> 03:03.571
That's a takeout menu
for a Thai restaurant.

03:05.141 --> 03:08.443
And that's why I thought
I'd go into assistanting.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.048
Fascinating, Amber.

03:13.049 --> 03:14.583
I see you started as a dancer.

03:14.584 --> 03:16.051
Do you have a specialty?

03:16.052 --> 03:18.654
Modern, jazz...

03:18.655 --> 03:21.257
pole?

03:21.258 --> 03:23.325
This is such a thrill, Mr. Madison.

03:23.326 --> 03:25.628
I'm your number one
fan. You're a legend.

03:25.629 --> 03:28.263
I'm only one man, Jared.

03:29.732 --> 03:32.735
I've taped every episode, I
write an Oscar Madison blog,

03:32.736 --> 03:34.435
oh, and check out my tattoo!

03:38.574 --> 03:41.009
Look, Oscar... his
nipples are your eyes.

03:43.112 --> 03:45.781
So I think the hallmark
of being a good assistant

03:45.782 --> 03:48.484
is keeping things running
smoothly in the background,

03:48.485 --> 03:51.287
so my employer can
shine in the spotlight.

03:51.288 --> 03:52.521
Very impressive, Margaret.

03:52.522 --> 03:54.190
What do you think, Oscar?

03:54.191 --> 03:55.791
I think the authorities should check out

03:55.815 --> 03:57.860
Jared's blog.

03:57.861 --> 04:01.297
He's got pictures of me
from my last vacation.

04:01.298 --> 04:03.631
Pictures I didn't take.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.669
Thank you, Margaret...
we will be in touch.

04:06.670 --> 04:08.971
It was lovely to meet you both.

04:08.972 --> 04:10.872
Here's one of me snorkeling.

04:11.540 --> 04:13.676
From underneath!

04:13.677 --> 04:15.744
Oscar, Margaret was great.

04:15.745 --> 04:17.213
Why didn't you like her?

04:17.214 --> 04:20.182
I don't know... she had kind
of a weird speech impediment.

04:20.183 --> 04:22.351
She's British!

04:22.352 --> 04:24.987
All right, let's just
see more applicants.

04:24.988 --> 04:26.655
No, no, no.

04:26.656 --> 04:29.017
I know in my gut that Margaret
is the right one for the job.

04:29.018 --> 04:30.521
And if I'm going to be your producer,

04:30.522 --> 04:32.461
you have to trust me to make decisions.

04:32.462 --> 04:34.029
Fine, it's your call.

04:34.030 --> 04:35.664
I hope you know what you're doing.

04:35.665 --> 04:37.333
This is your first big decision.

04:37.334 --> 04:38.334
You won't regret it.

04:38.335 --> 04:39.835
I better not.

04:39.836 --> 04:42.096
Because I think we saw a lot
of good people here today.

04:46.208 --> 04:47.476
You don't have to pay me.

04:47.477 --> 04:48.978
In fact, I could pay you.

04:48.979 --> 04:51.045
In backrubs.

04:56.151 --> 04:58.387
Everything all right?

04:58.388 --> 04:59.922
Are you enjoying your Linguini served

04:59.923 --> 05:01.190
"Unger" the moonlight?

05:03.059 --> 05:05.728
But you really didn't have
to go to all this trouble...

05:05.729 --> 05:10.431
making dinner, picking out
my outfit, trimming my hair.

05:11.901 --> 05:13.602
You think this is impressive?

05:13.603 --> 05:14.670
What?

05:14.671 --> 05:16.272
What's happening?

05:16.273 --> 05:18.173
Take a look at the
building across the street.

05:19.275 --> 05:22.778
In three, two, one...

05:22.779 --> 05:25.581
And now.

05:25.582 --> 05:27.549
Oh, my God.

05:27.550 --> 05:31.252
The lights in the windows
spell out "I love Emil""

05:33.222 --> 05:34.590
Damn it!

05:34.591 --> 05:38.560
I knew those "Y" bastards
were going to screw me over.

05:38.561 --> 05:41.897
This did not happen at the
4:00 or 6:00 rehearsals.

05:41.898 --> 05:44.632
Well, it's still nice.

05:45.567 --> 05:47.303
Nice.

05:47.304 --> 05:50.272
I was hoping for a slightly
more amorous reaction.

05:50.273 --> 05:51.807
In fact, I kind of promised one

05:51.808 --> 05:54.308
to the creepy guy in
the middle of the E.

05:56.278 --> 05:58.113
I'm sorry.

05:58.114 --> 06:00.115
I guess I've just

06:00.116 --> 06:03.085
been in a bit of a funk lately.

06:03.086 --> 06:05.421
A funk... I knew it!

06:05.422 --> 06:07.156
And you know how I feel about funk...

06:07.157 --> 06:08.490
I don't like it as a smell,

06:08.491 --> 06:10.792
as a musical genre,
or an emotional state.

06:12.928 --> 06:14.797
How can I help?

06:14.798 --> 06:16.432
There's nothing that you can do.

06:16.433 --> 06:19.567
I think that I just...

06:20.669 --> 06:21.603
What?

06:21.604 --> 06:24.506
You can tell me anything.

06:24.507 --> 06:27.176
I think I just miss England.

06:27.177 --> 06:29.244
I mean, for three
months every day it was

06:29.245 --> 06:31.080
one new adventure after another.

06:31.081 --> 06:32.348
I would... I'd wake up,

06:32.349 --> 06:33.849
I'd walk to a different part of town,

06:33.850 --> 06:35.150
I'd find some cool little pub,

06:35.151 --> 06:36.418
I'd play a game of darts.

06:36.419 --> 06:38.253
- That sounds wonderful.
- It was.

06:38.254 --> 06:41.423
But the farther away
that it gets for me,

06:41.424 --> 06:44.159
the more it feels like
it was just a dream.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.861
Some places just stay with you.

06:45.862 --> 06:47.285
I feel like that every time I leave

06:47.286 --> 06:49.085
The Container Store.

06:52.334 --> 06:54.169
I'll be okay, Felix.

06:54.170 --> 06:56.338
And thank you again for tonight.

06:56.339 --> 06:58.941
But I think what I need right now

06:58.942 --> 07:01.543
is just some time to figure things out.

07:01.544 --> 07:02.878
Absolutely.

07:02.879 --> 07:04.302
How much time are we talking about?

07:04.303 --> 07:05.602
I don't know.

07:06.615 --> 07:07.883
It's already been a month.

07:07.884 --> 07:08.725
So are we talking, like, another month?

07:08.726 --> 07:10.390
Because then we're in
the holidays, and...

07:10.391 --> 07:12.336
I said I don't know!

07:12.389 --> 07:14.556
I'm sorry.

07:14.557 --> 07:16.859
I think I'm just tired.

07:16.860 --> 07:18.392
I'm going to call it a night.

07:23.365 --> 07:24.800
Are you guys done with dinner?

07:24.801 --> 07:27.034
Or can I fight the pigeons for it?

07:29.000 --> 07:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:37.433 --> 07:38.376
Seriously?

07:38.377 --> 07:39.675
That is fantastic.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.019
Tell him if he has any questions,

07:41.020 --> 07:43.612
he can call producer Dani Duncan.

07:43.613 --> 07:45.681
Do you say that every time?

07:45.682 --> 07:46.682
No.

07:46.683 --> 07:47.950
Sometimes I sing it.

07:47.951 --> 07:50.119
♪ Produ... ♪

07:50.120 --> 07:52.554
♪ Stop. ♪

07:52.555 --> 07:55.391
So guess who I landed
for my very first booking?

07:55.392 --> 07:59.060
Hint... it's two-time
NBA champ Chris Bosh!

08:00.262 --> 08:02.431
- Seriously?
- Uh-huh.

08:02.432 --> 08:04.099
Dani, that's great...
that's a real coup.

08:04.100 --> 08:07.803
I know... some may
call it a "Slam Duncan."

08:07.804 --> 08:08.804
Some.

08:08.805 --> 08:10.138
Not me.

08:12.541 --> 08:14.109
Good morning, Ms. Duncan.

08:14.110 --> 08:15.529
I have Mr. Madison's coffee.

08:15.530 --> 08:16.145
Oh, thank you.

08:16.146 --> 08:17.379
Two shots, one sugar, right?

08:17.380 --> 08:18.414
Oh, poo.

08:18.415 --> 08:19.715
I got one shot, two sugars.

08:19.716 --> 08:21.216
Oh, well, no worries.

08:21.217 --> 08:23.080
You just go downstairs
and get him another one.

08:23.081 --> 08:24.219
Can I grab a snack first?

08:24.220 --> 08:26.429
I need something to eat every two hours.

08:26.430 --> 08:28.173
Yeah, but Oscar's show
starts in 20 minutes.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.208
Oh, no, they think it's a tapeworm.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.110
Okay, fine.

08:33.111 --> 08:35.192
It's your first day, so
I'll go back down and get it.

08:35.193 --> 08:37.056
But tomorrow, I'm going
to need you to step up.

08:37.057 --> 08:38.299
Oh, of course.

08:38.301 --> 08:39.601
Not literally, right?

08:39.602 --> 08:41.436
Because steps aggravate my knee rot.

08:45.741 --> 08:47.076
Where are you going?

08:47.077 --> 08:48.077
Is that my coffee?

08:48.078 --> 08:49.277
No... I'll be right back.

08:52.614 --> 08:54.249
Hey, Felix.

08:54.250 --> 08:55.850
Nice rack.

08:57.753 --> 09:00.756
Courtesy chuckle, ha ha, moving on.

09:00.757 --> 09:02.825
I had a genius idea.

09:02.826 --> 09:06.428
Emily misses London, so I am
going to bring London to her.

09:06.429 --> 09:07.930
Where did you get all this stuff?

09:07.931 --> 09:09.665
I am the wardrobe master

09:09.666 --> 09:11.433
of my Gilbert and Sullivan Society.

09:11.434 --> 09:12.868
I'll never forget

09:12.869 --> 09:14.336
my debut in The Mikado.

09:14.337 --> 09:16.370
I made an incredible Nanki-Poo.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.943
Why, were you nervous?

09:20.944 --> 09:23.712
I plan to surround Emily with reminders

09:23.713 --> 09:25.314
of her days across the pond.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.782
Perhaps she'll meet a London bobby, hmm?

09:29.518 --> 09:32.320
Or a right cheeky chimney sweep.

09:32.955 --> 09:34.189
Felix,

09:34.190 --> 09:36.859
when a woman has a problem,

09:36.860 --> 09:39.294
just listen... don't try to solve it.

09:39.295 --> 09:41.363
Sometimes the sexiest part of a man

09:41.364 --> 09:43.064
is his ear.

09:44.633 --> 09:47.034
Charlotte left a Cosmo in my bathroom.

09:48.837 --> 09:51.206
I don't know, Oscar... I
mean, I have to do something.

09:51.207 --> 09:52.674
I can feel her pulling away.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.143
Well, just give her some space.

09:54.144 --> 09:55.577
Maybe she'll sort out her issues

09:55.578 --> 09:57.161
and you two will be stronger than ever.

09:57.162 --> 09:58.514
Worked for Charlotte and me.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.549
Backing off isn't exactly my thing.

10:00.550 --> 10:02.584
Well, that's all I've got.

10:02.585 --> 10:04.686
Unless you want Cosmo's
top ten exercises

10:04.687 --> 10:06.554
for a bun-tastic summer.

10:07.489 --> 10:08.490
You want that?

10:08.491 --> 10:09.824
I do. Okay, I'll go get it.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.697
Look, I'll find the money.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.766
Just please don't shut off my service.

10:17.767 --> 10:20.002
I won't survive the winter without it.

10:20.003 --> 10:21.202
Thank you.

10:22.504 --> 10:24.038
Netflix.

10:26.875 --> 10:28.510
Say, Margaret?

10:28.511 --> 10:30.245
Quick take this stuff for Oscar.

10:30.246 --> 10:32.179
Yep, yeah, it's okay, it's okay,

10:33.248 --> 10:34.616
Wow... dry-cleaning, groceries,

10:34.617 --> 10:36.285
and coffee, all before noon?

10:36.286 --> 10:39.221
Your wish is my command.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.423
Do you think you have enough
energy to make me lunch?

10:41.424 --> 10:43.392
I'm in the mood for something healthy.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.593
How about a hoagie?

10:44.594 --> 10:46.728
I'll get straight on it, sir.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.430
"Straight on it."

10:48.431 --> 10:50.197
It's like "right away," but special-er.

10:54.536 --> 10:56.305
What exactly is a hoagie?

10:56.306 --> 10:57.873
I'll do it.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.977
This is Dani.

11:01.978 --> 11:03.378
Oh, hi.

11:03.379 --> 11:05.247
What time do we want Chris Bosh?

11:05.248 --> 11:07.716
Let me think about it.

11:11.086 --> 11:12.888
Noah!

11:12.889 --> 11:15.757
I told you to crouch in the
pantry until Grammy Margaret

11:15.758 --> 11:18.293
gave you the all clear.

11:18.294 --> 11:20.062
You brought your grandson to work?

11:20.063 --> 11:22.564
Well, I couldn't very
well leave him on his own.

11:22.565 --> 11:24.231
He's a bit of a firebug.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.302
I am sorry for the screaming.

11:27.303 --> 11:29.738
I'm just so thrilled that
he's coming to do the show.

11:29.739 --> 11:31.840
Oh, step away from the
stove, you devil child!

11:31.841 --> 11:33.242
No!

11:33.243 --> 11:35.177
No, not you, you sound lovely.

11:35.178 --> 11:36.445
You know what?

11:36.446 --> 11:37.813
Can I just call you right back?

11:37.814 --> 11:41.650
Um, Margaret, this is is not working.

11:41.651 --> 11:43.185
Are you letting me go?

11:43.186 --> 11:45.020
No, I can't fire you.

11:45.021 --> 11:47.822
Fire.

11:50.759 --> 11:52.427
I went out on a limb for you.

11:52.428 --> 11:54.491
I need to show Oscar that
I made the right decision.

11:54.492 --> 11:57.199
So I am stuck with you.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.635
So could you please
just, I don't know, focus,

11:59.636 --> 12:02.638
and learn how to make
this damn sandwich?

12:02.639 --> 12:05.641
Did you hear that, Noah?

12:05.642 --> 12:07.442
They can't fire Grammy this time.

12:07.443 --> 12:09.777
Fire.

12:11.647 --> 12:12.848
Mmm-mmm.

12:12.849 --> 12:14.783
Mmm!

12:14.784 --> 12:16.167
How's that sandwich coming?

12:16.168 --> 12:18.435
Oh, it's bloomin' lovely!

12:22.357 --> 12:23.992
Almost there.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.295
Don't you find it alarming
that a man can drag

12:26.296 --> 12:28.319
a blindfolded woman through
the streets of New York

12:28.320 --> 12:30.854
and no one stops to help?

12:32.968 --> 12:34.535
Ta-da!

12:36.004 --> 12:36.905
Oh.

12:36.906 --> 12:39.341
An English pub.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.976
Because I told you
that I missed England.

12:40.977 --> 12:42.578
Yes, and I heard what you were saying.

12:42.579 --> 12:44.580
Really? Because I also said...

12:44.581 --> 12:48.717
And that is why I have
planned an entire day

12:48.718 --> 12:50.652
of British surprises.

12:50.653 --> 12:52.754
You know, the great thing about a pub

12:52.755 --> 12:55.222
is that you never know
who you're going to meet.

12:56.091 --> 12:58.025
Who you're going to meet!

12:58.954 --> 13:00.377
Flowers for sale!

13:00.378 --> 13:01.496
'Allo.

13:01.497 --> 13:04.266
Pretty as a daisy, you are.

13:04.267 --> 13:06.234
Oh, look.

13:06.235 --> 13:07.903
You've hired your friends to dress up as

13:07.904 --> 13:09.370
English stereotypes.

13:10.539 --> 13:13.208
That no longer exist.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.910
Isn't it whimsical?

13:14.911 --> 13:16.078
Can I get your largest glass

13:16.079 --> 13:18.614
of alcohol, please?

13:18.615 --> 13:20.248
Is something wrong?

13:20.249 --> 13:22.117
Well, yes.

13:22.118 --> 13:25.420
I mean, I said that I needed some space,

13:25.421 --> 13:27.422
and then all of this.

13:27.423 --> 13:30.058
I'm not really sure how much
clearer I could have been.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.093
Aha!

13:31.094 --> 13:33.562
I think I have a clue.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.597
Glad someone does.

13:35.598 --> 13:37.866
Actually, Sherlock, could
you give us a minute?

13:37.867 --> 13:40.769
Ooh, am I detecting
some trouble in paradise?

13:40.770 --> 13:42.636
Seriously, Derek, walk away!

13:43.939 --> 13:46.241
I'm sorry, I'm off to a bad start here.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.610
Maybe I should skip
ahead to the big surprise.

13:48.611 --> 13:49.977
There's more?

13:56.818 --> 13:58.487
Two tickets to England.

13:58.488 --> 14:00.722
We leave tomorrow!

14:00.723 --> 14:02.964
I cleared your work schedule,
I already packed your bags,

14:02.965 --> 14:05.188
and I have booked us a private
tour of the crown jewels.

14:05.189 --> 14:07.629
Felix, stop trying to fix everything.

14:07.630 --> 14:09.097
This isn't about you.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.399
'Allo.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.334
Pint for the lady. Oh, my God!

14:12.335 --> 14:14.670
Enough with the ridiculous accent

14:14.671 --> 14:16.771
and the stupid fake teeth!

14:19.007 --> 14:20.841
This is Donna, she works here.

14:24.179 --> 14:25.646
Thank you, Donna.

14:40.910 --> 14:42.759
And that's how I found myself

14:42.760 --> 14:46.928
in a holding cell with
Olympic gymnast Cathy Rigby.

14:48.196 --> 14:49.664
Which brings us to the end

14:49.665 --> 14:51.608
of "Killing Time Because
Chris Bosh is Not Here."

14:51.609 --> 14:53.509
Tune in tomorrow.

14:54.436 --> 14:56.104
I'm sorry, Oscar.

14:56.105 --> 14:57.966
I was supposed to call
to confirm the time,

14:57.967 --> 14:59.243
but I got distracted.

14:59.244 --> 15:00.212
By what?

15:00.213 --> 15:01.837
You should have all
the time in the world

15:01.838 --> 15:03.780
now that Margaret's doing
everything around here.

15:03.781 --> 15:05.515
Okay.

15:05.516 --> 15:09.186
You can't slack off just
because of fancy title.

15:09.187 --> 15:10.654
Mmm-hmm.

15:10.655 --> 15:11.942
Hey, you know what?

15:11.943 --> 15:14.384
You should have Margaret help
you with bookings for the show.

15:14.385 --> 15:15.626
Got it.

15:15.627 --> 15:17.694
And be sure to get her hoagie recipe.

15:17.695 --> 15:19.830
She's not a good assistant!

15:19.831 --> 15:21.931
She's very bad, possibly evil.

15:22.966 --> 15:25.135
Oh, Dani.

15:25.136 --> 15:28.104
Is someone jealous that her
replacement is doing so well?

15:31.308 --> 15:34.678
Margaret, do you have
Oscar's post-show coffee?

15:34.679 --> 15:36.480
Here you go, sir.

15:36.481 --> 15:38.181
Two shots, one sugar.

15:38.182 --> 15:40.182
Ah, just the way I like it.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.221
Ah.

15:44.222 --> 15:45.988
This is mushroom soup.

15:47.691 --> 15:49.226
Oh, fiddlesticks.

15:49.227 --> 15:50.494
That's where my lunch went.

15:50.495 --> 15:51.628
Ah.

15:51.629 --> 15:53.130
Okay, bye-bye, Margaret.

15:53.131 --> 15:55.231
Yeah, just go right
straight through there.

15:58.168 --> 16:00.370
I don't understand...
everything else got done.

16:00.371 --> 16:02.973
I know, because I was doing it.

16:02.974 --> 16:04.508
Why didn't you just fire her?

16:04.509 --> 16:06.750
Because I didn't want you to
know how badly I screwed up,

16:06.751 --> 16:08.294
because then you would know the truth.

16:08.295 --> 16:08.845
Which is?

16:08.846 --> 16:10.514
That I don't deserve this job.

16:10.515 --> 16:12.482
I don't know what you
guys were thinking,

16:12.483 --> 16:15.218
but I'm obviously not producer material.

16:15.219 --> 16:17.321
You might as well make
me an assistant again.

16:17.322 --> 16:20.757
Well, Dani, I thought
you could handle anything.

16:20.758 --> 16:22.892
Guess I was wrong.

16:23.727 --> 16:25.661
Wait, what?

16:28.398 --> 16:29.933
What are you talking about?

16:29.934 --> 16:32.069
Well, first you messed
up by hiring Margaret.

16:32.070 --> 16:33.370
Then you couldn't fire her.

16:33.371 --> 16:34.671
But that's okay,

16:34.672 --> 16:37.074
Not everyone's cut out to be a boss.

16:37.075 --> 16:39.109
I guess not.

16:39.110 --> 16:41.244
Sure, you're sweet and
you're good at doing errands.

16:41.245 --> 16:45.182
But sometimes a producer
has to make the tough calls.

16:45.183 --> 16:47.850
And maybe that's just not your thing.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.190
Well I'm off to get my nails done.

16:53.191 --> 16:55.092
Dani said it was okay.

16:55.093 --> 16:56.859
Didn't you, Dani?

16:59.796 --> 17:01.698
Well,

17:01.699 --> 17:05.868
what I actually said was
you can take your tapeworm

17:05.869 --> 17:08.972
and your tiny arsonist and
get your limey ass out of here!

17:08.973 --> 17:10.873
You are fired!

17:13.443 --> 17:15.712
And if you have a problem with that,

17:15.713 --> 17:20.316
you can have your lawyer
call producer Dani Duncan!

17:22.419 --> 17:24.252
She's the boss.

17:25.321 --> 17:26.755
Come on, Noah!

17:35.047 --> 17:36.179
You saw that, right?

17:36.180 --> 17:37.982
It wasn't just me?

17:38.587 --> 17:42.090
Well, looks like someone is
producer material after all.

17:42.091 --> 17:44.526
I know what you did there, Oscar.

17:44.527 --> 17:45.760
And thank you.

17:45.761 --> 17:46.828
Miss Duncan,

17:46.829 --> 17:48.663
May I make you a cup of coffee?

17:48.664 --> 17:50.599
I would love that.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.233
Will you show me how to make a cup...

18:00.909 --> 18:02.611
Everything all right?

18:02.612 --> 18:06.380
Well, I just drank a pint
of beer on the toilet, so...

18:07.349 --> 18:09.084
I've been better.

18:09.085 --> 18:12.420
I'm sorry I've been so tone deaf.

18:12.421 --> 18:14.756
And me with perfect pitch.

18:14.757 --> 18:16.625
You know what?

18:16.626 --> 18:19.594
I think that it's incredibly sweet

18:19.595 --> 18:21.963
that you wanted to give me England.

18:21.964 --> 18:27.135
But I realized that it's
not England that I miss,

18:27.136 --> 18:31.072
but the way that I
felt when I was there.

18:31.073 --> 18:34.643
My whole life, I've
never been on my own.

18:34.644 --> 18:36.978
I went from my parents to my husband

18:36.979 --> 18:39.214
to my sister to you.

18:39.215 --> 18:42.050
Which was great, to be honest,

18:42.051 --> 18:44.219
because I've always
been afraid to be alone.

18:44.220 --> 18:48.123
Then I went to England,
and there was no one there

18:48.124 --> 18:49.758
to make decisions for me.

18:49.759 --> 18:51.159
I had to make them for myself.

18:51.160 --> 18:54.896
And it was exhilarating.

18:54.897 --> 18:56.598
I understand.

18:56.599 --> 19:00.101
You got your first
taste of independence.

19:00.102 --> 19:02.085
Ironic it happened in
England, where they frown on

19:02.086 --> 19:03.585
that sort of thing, usually.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.275
And now that I'm home,

19:07.276 --> 19:10.478
I feel like I need to be on my own.

19:10.479 --> 19:12.180
Okay.

19:12.181 --> 19:14.282
I will give you some space.

19:14.283 --> 19:15.468
I will coordinate our schedules

19:15.469 --> 19:17.612
so we don't run into each
other, and then in two weeks

19:17.614 --> 19:19.234
we'll meet up at a neutral location...

19:20.589 --> 19:22.490
I'm doing it again. I'm
sorry, I can't help it.

19:22.491 --> 19:23.925
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.

19:23.926 --> 19:26.528
Look, you take care of people.

19:26.529 --> 19:28.496
And I love that about you.

19:28.497 --> 19:30.532
But...

19:30.533 --> 19:34.601
I need to learn to take care of myself.

19:35.804 --> 19:38.172
So this is happening...
we're breaking up.

19:41.476 --> 19:44.279
Should we get out of here?

19:44.280 --> 19:46.223
Actually, if you don't
mind, I think I might stay

19:46.224 --> 19:47.245
and finish my pint.

19:48.550 --> 19:51.620
Not really sure where I am,

19:51.621 --> 19:53.787
since I was blindfolded, but...

20:11.473 --> 20:13.141
Greetings, my loyal...

20:13.142 --> 20:15.409
Walk away, Delores!

20:34.044 --> 20:35.686
Hi, I'm Chris Bosh.

20:35.687 --> 20:37.888
Is this where they record
the Oscar Madison Show?

20:37.889 --> 20:39.022
It is.

20:39.023 --> 20:40.390
Sorry I'm late.

20:40.391 --> 20:42.159
There was a mix-up with the time.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.660
You ever have one of those days?

20:49.966 --> 20:52.201
I'll be okay.

20:52.869 --> 20:54.137
Hey, Chris, you made it!

20:54.138 --> 20:55.504
You must be Oscar.

20:57.340 --> 21:00.010
I see you've met Felix.

21:00.011 --> 21:01.912
Is he crying?

21:01.913 --> 21:05.581
No, no, I'm just allergic
to your fabric softener.
