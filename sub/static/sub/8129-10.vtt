? Anyone else but me

01:06.332 --> 01:07.866
police still haven't found Archie.

01:07.934 --> 01:11.736
Why, Gloria, I'm so glad you're back!

01:11.804 --> 01:15.673
Ooh, I'd been going crazy
waiting to tell you!

01:15.741 --> 01:18.410
Tell us what, ma? You heard from Archie!

01:18.478 --> 01:20.811
Oh, I wanted to tell you.

01:22.381 --> 01:24.015
Well, go ahead, ma, tell us.

01:24.116 --> 01:26.918
I heard from Archie!

01:26.985 --> 01:27.785
[Mike exclaiming]

01:27.853 --> 01:29.721
That's terrific, ma!

01:29.788 --> 01:31.656
I'm so happy. He's all right?

01:31.723 --> 01:34.593
Oh, yeah, he's fine, Mike, just fine.

01:34.660 --> 01:37.696
Oh! Well, ma, where is he?

01:37.763 --> 01:40.065
Is he comin' home? What'd he say?

01:40.132 --> 01:42.133
Oh, wait a minute now, let me see.
1: Where is he?

01:42.268 --> 01:43.468
He's at the airport.

01:43.535 --> 01:46.271
2: He's on his way home now.

01:46.338 --> 01:48.806
3... what was your 3rd question?

01:48.874 --> 01:51.242
What did he say? Oh!

01:51.309 --> 01:53.745
He said, "hi, Edith,

01:53.813 --> 01:55.547
guess who this is."

01:57.049 --> 01:58.316
And I did.

02:00.218 --> 02:02.587
Oh, boy, I'm glad he's safe.

02:02.655 --> 02:05.723
But why didn't he get to his
lodge convention in buffalo?

02:05.791 --> 02:07.658
Because on the airplane

02:07.727 --> 02:10.061
he sat next to a mormon.

02:14.533 --> 02:15.900
Ma!

02:15.967 --> 02:17.302
A mormon?

02:17.369 --> 02:20.272
Yeah, he missed the bus, so
he had to take an airplane.

02:20.339 --> 02:23.475
And you can only have 2 drinks on a plane.

02:23.542 --> 02:26.978
But Archie had 4 on account of the mormon.

02:28.347 --> 02:31.316
Mormons don't drink, you see.

02:31.384 --> 02:32.750
Mormons don't drink. I know--

02:32.818 --> 02:34.385
I know mormons don't drink. Ma! Ma!

02:34.453 --> 02:36.087
What has that got to do with anything?

02:36.154 --> 02:39.690
Well, this mormon liked to
collect the little bottles.

02:39.725 --> 02:43.561
So Archie emptied 'em for him.

02:43.629 --> 02:47.598
And that's how Archie got to
the foot doctors' convention.

02:48.834 --> 02:50.167
Foot doctor?

02:50.236 --> 02:51.403
Ma!

02:51.470 --> 02:54.205
Oh, I get it! You mean he
went to the wrong hotel.

02:54.273 --> 02:56.274
Oh, no, it was the right hotel,

02:56.342 --> 02:59.010
but the wrong city.

02:59.078 --> 03:03.481
You see, the foot doctors'
holiday inn was in Rochester.

03:03.548 --> 03:07.618
But Archie didn't realize
it until he saw the big toe

03:07.686 --> 03:10.221
hangin' in the lobby.

03:10.289 --> 03:12.323
This is like <i>the twilight zone.</i>

03:12.391 --> 03:14.125
Ma!

03:14.192 --> 03:16.627
Ma, you mean he never even got to buffalo?

03:16.695 --> 03:20.164
Oh, well, Archie was all
set to leave for buffalo,

03:20.232 --> 03:24.235
but some of the doctors invited
him to have a couple of drinks.

03:24.303 --> 03:26.404
And while they was drinkin',

03:26.472 --> 03:29.841
Archie got elected to a committee.

03:33.045 --> 03:35.079
Who'd they think he was? Dr. scholl?

03:37.083 --> 03:39.050
No, Dr. bunker!

03:40.552 --> 03:43.421
He was put on the steering committee.

03:43.489 --> 03:46.691
And then the steering
committee all got into a car

03:46.758 --> 03:49.794
and they steered the wrong
way up a one-way street.

03:51.330 --> 03:53.898
And that's how they landed in jail.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.332
Jail?

03:55.468 --> 03:56.701
Archie was in jail?

03:56.769 --> 03:58.903
Yeah, but only for a little while.

03:58.971 --> 04:02.107
'Cause Archie says that
policemen are nicer to doctors

04:02.174 --> 04:04.642
than they are to misters.

04:04.710 --> 04:08.012
Oh, my, I can't wait to see Archie.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.515
Ah, me, too. I really missed daddy.

04:10.582 --> 04:11.950
You know, so did I.

04:12.018 --> 04:15.253
Aw, Mike, that's nice.

04:15.321 --> 04:19.023
Yeah, it was strange not being
called "meathead" for 2 whole days.

04:19.089 --> 04:21.158
Oh, well, here, then let me help you out.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.361
[Imitating archie] Hey, it's
way past lunch time, meathead,

04:23.429 --> 04:26.163
what's your fat face doing
out of the refrigerator?

04:26.231 --> 04:29.233
That's terrific, Gloria. You know,
you got Archie down to a tee.

04:29.301 --> 04:32.570
Get them dirty hands off my
little girl, you commie pinko.

04:34.507 --> 04:36.774
You know you're almost
starting to grate on me?

04:37.009 --> 04:39.877
Hey, why don't you get a
haircut, you hippie prevert!

04:41.413 --> 04:43.147
You're starting to grate on me.

04:43.215 --> 04:46.217
Uh, did you ever think of
gettin' a job, you lazy slob?

04:46.285 --> 04:49.120
That's it, Gloria, that's it.
You over-grated.

04:49.955 --> 04:52.357
Oh, my, it's so nice

04:52.425 --> 04:55.593
hearing those names again.

04:55.661 --> 04:58.663
Look at me, I'm all goose pimply.

04:58.730 --> 05:01.933
Oh, ma, I don't know what I'm
gonna do till daddy gets home.

05:02.001 --> 05:03.133
Hey, I know what we could do.

05:03.201 --> 05:04.836
Why don't we go to the Brooklyn museum?

05:04.870 --> 05:07.438
No, Michael, I wanna be
here when daddy gets home.

05:07.505 --> 05:10.341
Why? Because he's my father.

05:10.409 --> 05:11.743
An accident of birth.

05:12.911 --> 05:15.613
Oh, no, my Gloria was born

05:15.680 --> 05:18.316
11 months after we was married.

05:21.687 --> 05:24.555
Well, you know, we've been cooped
up in this house for 2 days

05:24.623 --> 05:26.657
and now that we know where
Archie is, and he's all right,

05:26.725 --> 05:28.159
I'd--I'd like to do something.

05:28.226 --> 05:31.262
I know what we could do. It'll be fun.

05:31.329 --> 05:32.964
I'll be right back.

05:33.031 --> 05:35.600
Michael, if you wanna go to the
museum, it's all right with me.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.602
I'll think of some excuse to tell daddy

05:37.670 --> 05:40.405
about why you weren't here to
greet him when he gets home.

05:40.472 --> 05:43.407
Gloria, the man is not
returning from the moon.

05:43.475 --> 05:45.676
He's coming home from a 2-day drunk.

05:47.546 --> 05:50.882
All right. But I just wanna see
him walk through that door

05:50.950 --> 05:52.717
safe and sound.

05:52.784 --> 05:54.685
You'll have to settle for safe.

05:55.788 --> 05:56.987
Gloria, look!

05:57.055 --> 05:58.589
Your old hula hoop.

05:58.657 --> 05:59.690
(Gloria) Oh, mother!

05:59.758 --> 06:00.924
(Michael) Oh, Gloria.

06:01.460 --> 06:02.560
[Exclaims]

06:02.628 --> 06:03.961
Now you do it.

06:04.029 --> 06:06.264
I haven't done it in such a long time.
Look out.

06:06.331 --> 06:07.265
Yeah.

06:07.332 --> 06:08.533
Ha-ha!

06:08.600 --> 06:12.002
This is a real thrill. I'm
walking to the museum.

06:12.104 --> 06:14.071
Have fun! I will.

06:14.139 --> 06:17.342
Oh, Mike! Please, stay!

06:17.409 --> 06:19.177
Archie will be here soon

06:19.245 --> 06:22.747
and it'd be so nice to
have the whole family here

06:22.814 --> 06:24.115
to welcome him.

06:26.184 --> 06:28.686
All right, ma, I'll stay. Aw!

06:28.754 --> 06:32.022
What are we gonna do? I don't
wanna do the hula hoop.

06:32.090 --> 06:34.758
I know what we could do. We could eat.

06:34.826 --> 06:36.960
That's a good idea.

06:37.028 --> 06:40.198
I'll get the lunch on as
soon as the coffee is ready.

06:40.265 --> 06:42.934
Uh, no coffee for me, ma.
I'll just have water.

06:43.001 --> 06:44.468
All right.

06:44.536 --> 06:46.770
'Course, I would have preferred
to have some royal crown cola,

06:46.838 --> 06:48.872
if my wife had remembered to get some.

06:48.940 --> 06:51.976
I did get some, Michael,
it's in the refrigerator.

06:52.043 --> 06:53.344
Wait, I looked in the refrigerator.

06:53.412 --> 06:55.413
All I saw there was coke an diet Pepsi.

06:55.514 --> 06:58.683
Did you ever think of looking
in the refrigerator door?

06:58.717 --> 07:01.819
We don't keep soft drinks in
the refrigerator door, Gloria.

07:01.887 --> 07:04.822
Why would you want to put my
cola in the refrigerator door?

07:05.090 --> 07:07.825
Because I'm an evil person!

07:08.727 --> 07:10.228
Gloria, that's not funny!

07:10.295 --> 07:12.130
I wanted to have a drink of
royal crown cola before,

07:12.197 --> 07:13.464
but I didn't know where to look for it

07:13.532 --> 07:15.766
and I wound up having nothing.

07:15.834 --> 07:17.701
My heart bleeds for you.

07:17.769 --> 07:20.438
This is serious, Gloria. This is serious!

07:20.505 --> 07:23.807
Do not, I repeat, do not play hide
and seek with my royal crown cola!

07:25.477 --> 07:28.213
Oh, Michael, what's the difference?

07:28.280 --> 07:30.114
Gloria, there's a big difference.

07:30.182 --> 07:32.350
You like diet Pepsi, ma likes coke,

07:32.418 --> 07:34.051
well, I like royal crown cola.

07:34.119 --> 07:35.953
Well, I don't believe you
even know the difference

07:36.021 --> 07:38.122
between your cola and any other cola.

07:38.190 --> 07:39.724
You don't think I know the difference, huh?

07:39.791 --> 07:41.359
You don't think I know the difference?

07:41.427 --> 07:43.828
Well, let me tell you something, Gloria.
I know the difference.

07:43.895 --> 07:46.130
I've been drinking colas all my life.

07:46.198 --> 07:48.165
Yeah, and all the bubbles
went to your head.

07:48.233 --> 07:50.033
[Snickering]

07:50.269 --> 07:52.002
Come and get it!

07:52.070 --> 07:53.104
Mmm.

07:53.172 --> 07:54.739
I'm not eatin'.

07:54.806 --> 07:59.276
Oh, Mike, it's lima beans <i>italienne.</i>

07:59.344 --> 08:02.146
Oh, Irene brought it over.

08:02.214 --> 08:03.580
I'm not eatin', ma.

08:03.648 --> 08:07.385
Oh, it looks so good, and smell it.

08:08.153 --> 08:09.487
[Blowing]

08:12.824 --> 08:14.425
Delicious!

08:16.094 --> 08:17.495
Serve it up.

08:23.301 --> 08:25.369
No, ma, you know I can't have lima beans.

08:25.436 --> 08:27.404
You know what happens to
me when I have lima beans.

08:27.472 --> 08:30.074
Oh, no, no, not this again.

08:30.142 --> 08:33.177
Well, it's true. When I eat lima beans,

08:33.244 --> 08:35.880
my eyes water up and I
get hives all over me,

08:35.947 --> 08:38.082
and my neck swells up like a cantaloupe.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.383
I've told you that.

08:39.450 --> 08:42.119
Aw, bull, Gloria, I never saw that happen.

08:42.187 --> 08:44.221
You sound like you wanna see it happen.

08:44.289 --> 08:45.556
Why not?

08:47.726 --> 08:49.860
We're not going to the museum.

08:49.928 --> 08:52.630
Eat a lima bean, let me
watch your neck swell up.

08:56.101 --> 08:59.837
If you don't believe I'm
allergic, you ask ma. Ma?

08:59.904 --> 09:01.538
You remember that time we
went to that restaurant

09:01.606 --> 09:03.374
and I ate all those lima beans?

09:03.441 --> 09:05.343
You remember how I broke
out in hives all over

09:05.410 --> 09:06.944
and my eyes started to water--

09:07.012 --> 09:09.947
and your neck swelled up like a cantaloupe?

09:10.015 --> 09:11.215
That's right.

09:11.283 --> 09:13.017
No, I don't remember.

09:13.986 --> 09:15.286
[Whining] Ma!

09:15.354 --> 09:17.121
Well, you told me about it, Gloria,

09:17.189 --> 09:20.257
but I must have been in the
ladies' room when it happened.

09:20.325 --> 09:21.859
Yeah, I knew it.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.928
Are you calling me a liar? Is
that what you're calling me?

09:23.996 --> 09:28.099
I'm not calling you a liar, Gloria. I
just don't believe you, that's all.

09:28.167 --> 09:30.868
Well, I don't believe that
you can tell the difference

09:30.936 --> 09:32.836
between royal crown cola

09:32.904 --> 09:34.605
and any other kind of cola.

09:34.673 --> 09:36.640
Would you like me to prove it to you?

09:36.708 --> 09:39.410
You bring 3 glasses of
cola out here, Gloria,

09:39.477 --> 09:42.313
and if I can tell which one
is the royal crown cola,

09:42.381 --> 09:44.448
you got to eat a lima bean.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.218
Is that a bet?

09:48.253 --> 09:49.520
Ok.

09:49.587 --> 09:52.790
But if you can't tell the difference,

09:52.858 --> 09:56.527
when daddy comes home, you have to throw
your arms around him and kiss him!

09:56.595 --> 09:58.662
[Laughing]

09:58.730 --> 10:01.398
Wait--wait--wait a second. That's not fair.

10:01.466 --> 10:04.035
All you could get is hives.
I could get killed.

10:05.236 --> 10:07.138
Is it a deal?

10:07.205 --> 10:08.740
It's a deal. Ok, I'll get the cola.

10:08.807 --> 10:09.874
Go ahead.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.176
Oh, my, Archie's gonna be so surprised,

10:12.244 --> 10:15.746
he ain't never been kissed by you before.

10:15.814 --> 10:18.983
He's not gonna be kissed by me now,
ma, 'cause I'm not gonna lose.

10:19.051 --> 10:21.718
Do you ever hear of anybody
who couldn't eat lima beans?

10:21.786 --> 10:24.122
No. But I had an Uncle

10:24.189 --> 10:27.091
who couldn't eat corn on a cob.

10:27.158 --> 10:28.259
You mean he broke out?

10:28.327 --> 10:30.194
No, he didn't have no teeth.

10:30.262 --> 10:31.262
[Laughing]

10:39.938 --> 10:43.507
Mike, maybe you shouldn't
make her eat lima beans

10:43.575 --> 10:45.576
if she's allergic to 'em.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.077
It's all in her mind, ma.

10:47.145 --> 10:48.178
Ha!

10:48.246 --> 10:49.680
Ok, Mr. connoisseur,

10:49.748 --> 10:51.949
let's see if you can
show us which is which.

10:52.017 --> 10:54.919
Would you close your eyes and
turn around for a second?

10:54.986 --> 10:56.153
Ma...

10:56.221 --> 10:58.022
[Inaudible]

11:00.092 --> 11:01.391
Ok, Michael.

11:03.061 --> 11:05.530
Go ahead. Stand back. Give me room.

11:13.072 --> 11:14.072
[Gargling]

11:20.178 --> 11:21.178
[Swishing]

11:33.858 --> 11:36.127
Coke, Pepsi, royal crown cola.

11:37.028 --> 11:38.962
He did it!

11:39.030 --> 11:41.431
That was just a lucky guess!

11:41.499 --> 11:43.634
No, Gloria, that is cola know-how.

11:45.504 --> 11:48.873
You lost. Pay up, my dear.

11:48.940 --> 11:51.709
Michael, you wouldn't
really want me to eat that.

11:51.776 --> 11:53.443
Gloria, you said before,

11:53.511 --> 11:56.046
when you ate a whole bunch of these,
your neck swelled up like a cantaloupe.

11:56.114 --> 11:58.082
What could one little lima bean do?

11:58.150 --> 12:00.151
It's the first one, and then, boom!

12:00.219 --> 12:02.652
[Gibbering]

12:02.720 --> 12:04.988
Does it take a while, or
does it happen right away?

12:05.056 --> 12:06.089
Right away.

12:06.157 --> 12:07.224
Ooh, I gotta see that.

12:09.394 --> 12:12.697
Come on, let's go. One
little bean, here we go.

12:13.331 --> 12:14.765
Ok.

12:14.833 --> 12:16.467
Ok, but you're gonna see
what happens to me.

12:16.535 --> 12:18.135
And when you see what happens to me,

12:18.203 --> 12:19.570
it's gonna be all your fault, Michael,

12:19.637 --> 12:22.606
and you're gonna be the one that's
gonna have to live with it.

12:36.188 --> 12:38.389
[Panting]

12:38.457 --> 12:39.957
Oh, it's starting to happen to me!

12:40.025 --> 12:41.191
What's happening?

12:41.259 --> 12:43.560
I feel the hives on me! Hives?
Where? Show me.

12:43.628 --> 12:46.663
All over! They're all over
my legs, and my arms!

12:46.731 --> 12:47.965
Show me one hive!

12:48.033 --> 12:49.199
My neck!

12:49.267 --> 12:50.667
What? Is it like a cantaloupe?

12:50.735 --> 12:52.769
No, it's more like a watermelon!

12:52.837 --> 12:55.005
Oh, a watermelon. I gotta see
a watermelon. Let me see.

12:55.073 --> 12:56.473
I can't breath! Take your hands away,

12:56.541 --> 12:57.674
I can't see nothing.

12:57.742 --> 12:59.176
You wanna see? Take your hands away.

12:59.244 --> 13:00.811
Ok, I'll show you. Go ahead.

13:00.878 --> 13:02.579
There! There. What?

13:02.647 --> 13:03.814
[Gasping]

13:06.518 --> 13:08.319
I don't see a watermelon.

13:08.387 --> 13:09.820
Not even an orange?

13:11.023 --> 13:12.556
How 'bout, not even a raisin.

13:14.592 --> 13:16.160
Come on, ma, let's eat.

13:17.529 --> 13:20.731
Well, it'll probably be a delayed reaction.

13:20.798 --> 13:24.068
Oh, Gloria, you're not
allergic to lima beans.

13:24.169 --> 13:26.336
You calling me a liar again?

13:26.404 --> 13:29.639
No, no, Gloria. I'm just telling
you it's all in your mind.

13:29.707 --> 13:31.808
Well, ok, Mr. stivic.

13:31.877 --> 13:34.144
We'll just see who's the one that's lying
around here. That's what we'll see.

13:34.212 --> 13:35.445
What are you doing?

13:35.513 --> 13:37.814
Well, if I can find it,
you'll see what I'm doing.

13:37.883 --> 13:39.116
What? What is it?

13:39.184 --> 13:40.918
Here it is. I knew I put it here.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.586
Now we're gonna see who's the liar.

13:42.653 --> 13:44.188
You're the one that's the liar.

13:44.256 --> 13:45.756
Me?

13:45.824 --> 13:49.259
Liar, liar, pants on fire. You're
hanging from a telephone wire.

13:51.896 --> 13:53.163
(Michael) Oh, yeah?

13:53.231 --> 13:54.831
Well, I'm rubber, you're glue.

13:54.899 --> 13:58.068
Everything you say, bounces
off me and sticks to you.

14:00.471 --> 14:04.375
Turn him in, turn him out,
turn him into Sauerkraut.

14:04.442 --> 14:08.212
Sticks and stones may break my
bones, but names will never hurt me.

14:08.279 --> 14:10.948
Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home.

14:14.987 --> 14:16.820
You're a liar!

14:16.855 --> 14:18.321
Sticks and stones! Sticks and stones!

14:18.389 --> 14:19.456
[All yelling]

14:20.291 --> 14:22.159
Look! Look!

14:28.099 --> 14:29.800
You're calling me a liar, huh?

14:29.868 --> 14:31.135
What is that thing, anyway?

14:31.202 --> 14:34.471
This just happens to be a
love letter you once wrote me

14:34.539 --> 14:39.042
and it's so full of lies, you
could run for office with it.

14:39.110 --> 14:42.579
Come on, Gloria, anything I
ever wrote to you is the truth.

14:42.647 --> 14:43.747
Oh, yeah?

14:43.815 --> 14:45.449
Well, this little gem
will prove you different.

14:45.516 --> 14:48.385
You happen to have written this about
3 months before we were married.

14:48.453 --> 14:50.287
Listen to this, ma.

14:51.156 --> 14:52.657
"Dear, Gloria,

14:52.724 --> 14:56.059
"my heart is a prisoner
and you have the key.

14:56.127 --> 14:59.497
I'll serve a life sentence,
if you'll marry me."

14:59.564 --> 15:00.965
True. All true.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.736
"From the very first night,
I started to woo ya,

15:05.804 --> 15:08.973
it's been, Gloria, Gloria, hallelujah."

15:11.542 --> 15:13.711
Oh, Mike, that's beautiful.

15:14.779 --> 15:16.846
Thank you very much, ma.

15:16.914 --> 15:18.449
So, where did I lie?

15:18.983 --> 15:21.151
"P.S.

15:21.219 --> 15:25.222
"When we kissed last night, I
wanted it to go on and on."

15:25.290 --> 15:26.990
[Panting]

15:27.058 --> 15:29.693
"My darling, if they
stuck a needle in my arm

15:29.761 --> 15:33.330
and fed me intravenously, I
could kiss you forever."

15:34.900 --> 15:36.500
Bull.

15:36.567 --> 15:39.403
What do you mean "bull"? I
meant every word of that.

15:39.471 --> 15:41.305
Well, I haven't seen any proof of it.

15:41.372 --> 15:43.507
Kiss me forever. Ha!

15:43.575 --> 15:47.277
Gloria, haven't you ever
heard of poetic license?

15:47.345 --> 15:50.815
This kinda poetry doesn't
deserve a license.

15:50.849 --> 15:53.284
Well, what do you expect me to do?
Hold the kiss forever?

15:53.351 --> 15:55.051
Yes. Yes, that's what I want.

15:55.119 --> 15:56.820
I want you to kiss me forever.

15:56.855 --> 15:58.555
Oh, come on, you're being ridiculous.

15:58.623 --> 16:02.292
Oh, all right. Then why don't you
just kiss me till daddy comes home.

16:02.360 --> 16:05.229
That could be an hour
. Nobody kisses for an hour.

16:05.296 --> 16:08.165
Oh, I saw on T.V. the other day.

16:08.232 --> 16:12.870
A couple kissed for a 106 hours.
They set a record.

16:13.438 --> 16:14.604
See.

16:14.672 --> 16:16.907
I'm not interested in setting
any records, all right?

16:16.975 --> 16:20.711
No, you're just interested in being
a liar, that's all. Listen to this.

16:20.778 --> 16:24.014
"My darling, if they stuck a needle in
my arm and fed me intravenously..."

16:24.082 --> 16:25.782
All right, all right, Gloria!

16:25.851 --> 16:28.618
You want me to kiss you for an
hour, I'll kiss you for an hour.

16:28.686 --> 16:30.454
But I'm gonna tell you right now, Gloria,

16:30.521 --> 16:33.190
I'm not going to enjoy it.

16:33.192 --> 16:34.724
Neither am I.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.293
Good. Let's go.

16:41.933 --> 16:43.700
Oh, just a minute, I'll be right back.

16:43.768 --> 16:47.004
Look at this. She challenges
me to a kiss for an hour

16:47.072 --> 16:49.706
and she can't even hold it
past the first 30 seconds.

16:49.774 --> 16:50.941
[Guffawing]

16:51.009 --> 16:54.578
Mike, you ain't really
mad at Gloria, are you?

16:54.646 --> 16:56.714
I don't like her calling me a liar, ma.

16:56.748 --> 16:58.749
Oh, she didn't mean it.

16:58.817 --> 17:02.753
You'll feel a lot better
once you start kissing.

17:04.454 --> 17:08.425
I remember a poem I used
to know in high school.

17:08.492 --> 17:11.828
"Never a lip is curved with pain

17:11.896 --> 17:14.864
that can't be kissed into smiles a-gain."

17:16.201 --> 17:17.968
They say "a-gain."

17:18.035 --> 17:22.339
Because it's really "again," but it's
"a-gain" so it'll rhyme with "pain."

17:24.075 --> 17:25.509
[Toilet flushing]

17:27.145 --> 17:28.745
(Gloria) Michael!

17:28.813 --> 17:30.013
What?

17:30.648 --> 17:32.215
Thanks a lot.

17:32.284 --> 17:34.117
What did I do now?

17:34.185 --> 17:36.153
See? That's just the problem. You
don't even know what you did.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.722
Time and time again. What did I do?

17:38.790 --> 17:41.559
Will you just start kissing me?

17:41.626 --> 17:43.327
Oh, excuse me.

17:45.363 --> 17:48.599
Will you please tell me what I did?

17:48.667 --> 17:51.201
You left the seat up again.

17:56.374 --> 17:57.641
I'm sorry.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.643
That's what you always say, "I'm sorry."

17:59.711 --> 18:03.880
Oh, Gloria. The seat's up, the
seat's down, what's the difference?

18:03.948 --> 18:06.883
When you're a girl,
there's a big difference.

18:08.586 --> 18:11.522
I don't know why you can never
remember to put the seat down,

18:11.589 --> 18:13.456
other husbands do.

18:13.524 --> 18:16.860
Oh, Archie don't. He says
that's woman's work.

18:19.030 --> 18:20.130
[Doorbell ringing]

18:20.197 --> 18:22.165
Oh, I'll get it.

18:23.801 --> 18:25.268
Don't stop.

18:25.336 --> 18:26.703
[Murmuring]

18:28.940 --> 18:31.509
Hi, Edith. You want some company?

18:31.576 --> 18:33.310
Yeah. Who's coming?

18:35.647 --> 18:36.647
Me!

18:36.715 --> 18:38.816
Oh, well come on in, Irene.

18:38.884 --> 18:43.086
I brought you a bottle of wine to
celebrate the return of Archie bunker.

18:43.154 --> 18:47.190
Oh, thanks, Irene. Oh,
I'll get the glasses.

18:48.593 --> 18:49.693
(Both) Hi, Irene.

18:49.761 --> 18:51.127
Hi.

18:51.195 --> 18:52.362
Uh, hi.

18:54.298 --> 18:56.399
Edith, am I interrupting something?

18:56.467 --> 19:01.271
Oh, no. Gloria and Mike are just trying
to hold a kiss till Archie gets here.

19:02.841 --> 19:06.676
Well, it's easier than swallowing goldfish.

19:06.744 --> 19:10.080
Michael, you taste like lima beans.

19:10.147 --> 19:11.448
See, you're not allergic.

19:11.516 --> 19:12.482
Ow! You bit me!

19:12.550 --> 19:13.584
Aw.

19:13.651 --> 19:15.386
Here you are, Irene.

19:15.453 --> 19:18.556
Why don't you sit down? They won't mind.

19:18.623 --> 19:22.393
Frankly, Edith, I've never thought
of kissing as a spectator sport.

19:23.628 --> 19:27.198
That's right. It's more a do-it-yourself.

19:27.265 --> 19:28.599
[Doorbell ringing]

19:28.667 --> 19:31.468
Oh, could that be Archie, so soon?

19:31.536 --> 19:32.736
Well if it is,

19:32.804 --> 19:35.171
? the party's over

19:35.239 --> 19:37.141
Louise. Hi, Edith.

19:37.208 --> 19:39.776
Big emergency. I need some bread.

19:39.844 --> 19:42.012
George has been drinking beer all day.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.948
And I want to put a sandwich
in him before he gets smashed.

19:45.016 --> 19:47.617
Oh, well, come on in the kitchen.

19:47.685 --> 19:50.621
Gloria, my leg has fallen asleep.

19:51.856 --> 19:52.989
Ok.

20:00.665 --> 20:02.499
Uh, hi, Irene.

20:03.067 --> 20:04.334
Not yet.

20:09.941 --> 20:12.075
How much do you want, Louise?

20:12.142 --> 20:14.344
Oh, just a couple of slices will do.

20:14.412 --> 20:18.281
Oh, Irene and me are celebrating.
Would you like some wine?

20:18.349 --> 20:21.285
Oh, no, thank you. I don't have any time.

20:21.287 --> 20:24.888
Uh, by the way, before I go
through that room again,

20:24.956 --> 20:28.692
is there anything you want to
tell me about Mike and Gloria.

20:30.294 --> 20:32.396
Oh, yeah, they're fighting.

20:33.598 --> 20:35.799
Oh.

20:35.866 --> 20:39.737
Irene, those, uh, lima beans
you sent over today, terrific.

20:40.338 --> 20:41.605
Gee, thanks.

20:41.673 --> 20:45.175
But I've never seen them
have this effect before.

20:45.243 --> 20:46.944
[Doorbell ringing]

20:47.879 --> 20:49.913
Don't bother, I'll get it.

20:53.084 --> 20:54.451
Oh, hello, George.

20:54.519 --> 20:55.719
Hi, Irene. Louise here?

20:55.786 --> 20:57.721
She's in the kitchen with Edith.

21:00.492 --> 21:02.025
Louise!

21:02.093 --> 21:03.460
Hi, George.

21:04.362 --> 21:06.229
We are out of beer.

21:06.297 --> 21:08.832
George, when you come
into a neighbor's house,

21:08.899 --> 21:11.268
it's polite to say "hello."

21:11.336 --> 21:13.804
Hello. And we're still out of beer.

21:14.706 --> 21:16.606
Then have some wine.

21:16.675 --> 21:18.976
Well, hello, neighbor.

21:21.912 --> 21:25.315
George, wine and beer,
that's a bad combination.

21:25.383 --> 21:27.851
So are we, but we worked it out.

21:29.954 --> 21:34.324
Oh, come on Louise, have some wine.

21:34.392 --> 21:37.027
You know, I'd like to make a little toast.

21:37.095 --> 21:39.496
No, no, no, no bread for me.
I'll stick to the wine.

21:41.232 --> 21:45.035
I meant a toast to Archie.

21:45.103 --> 21:48.271
To his good health and safe return.

21:48.339 --> 21:50.774
I'll drink to that.

21:50.842 --> 21:54.244
Now I know he's smashed.

21:54.311 --> 21:58.314
Yeah, Louise, you're even beginning
to look good to me again.

21:58.382 --> 22:01.852
I do? More wine. More wine.

22:04.222 --> 22:06.823
Oh, my, ain't this fun?

22:06.891 --> 22:11.161
This morning started so gloomy,
and I was missing Archie,

22:11.229 --> 22:14.264
and now he's coming home
and we're having a party.

22:14.332 --> 22:15.566
[Whooping]

22:15.633 --> 22:16.833
When is Archie going to get home?

22:16.901 --> 22:17.668
Who cares?

22:17.736 --> 22:19.236
George!

22:20.104 --> 22:22.472
? Who cares if the sky

22:22.540 --> 22:24.908
? starts to fall into the sea ?

22:24.975 --> 22:26.376
[All laughing]

22:26.444 --> 22:29.112
Edith, I think you have had enough.

22:29.180 --> 22:30.247
Oh, no.

22:30.315 --> 22:33.283
You can't fly on one leg.

22:36.086 --> 22:39.188
You know, I've been trying
to do this all day.

22:39.256 --> 22:42.292
Now I'm gonna to really do it. Watch.

22:44.295 --> 22:45.495
Oh!

22:50.835 --> 22:52.502
[Laughing]

22:53.938 --> 22:55.739
Oh, my, I feel so Hawaiian.

22:58.076 --> 23:00.510
What this party needs is some music.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.748
<i>?[Music playing]</i>

23:04.816 --> 23:07.784
Come on, baby. Let's see
if you still got it.

23:07.851 --> 23:10.820
Oh, I got it. Come and get it.

23:18.896 --> 23:21.565
Oh, well, what the hay, if
it's this kind of a party,

23:21.632 --> 23:25.402
I might as well join the fun. Bottoms up.

23:27.872 --> 23:30.440
(Edith) Oh, look at Irene.

23:47.658 --> 23:49.492
Oh, Jesus.

23:50.795 --> 23:53.130
I knew you wouldn't know
what to do without me,

23:53.198 --> 23:55.365
but I never thought you would go nuts.

23:56.234 --> 23:57.934
Archie!

23:58.002 --> 23:59.302
