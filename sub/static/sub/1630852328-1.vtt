<i>We come to you now with revelations
about last week's attack in London.</i>

00:06.632 --> 00:08.717
<i>An anonymous source provided this video.</i>

00:08.800 --> 00:13.597
<i>It shows Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio,
moments before his death.</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:15.891
<i>You may find this video disturbing.</i>

00:15.974 --> 00:17.893
<i>I managed to send the Elemental
back through the rift,</i>

00:17.976 --> 00:19.978
<i>but I don't think
I'm gonna make it off this bridge alive.</i>

00:20.062 --> 00:21.730
<i>Spider-Man attacked me.</i>

00:21.813 --> 00:24.316
<i>He has an army of drones,
Stark technology.</i>

00:24.399 --> 00:28.070
<i>He's saying he's the only one who's
gonna be the new Iron Man. No one else.</i>

00:28.153 --> 00:30.405
<i>Are you sure you want
to commence the drone attack?</i>

00:30.489 --> 00:32.366
<i>There will be significant casualties.</i>

00:32.448 --> 00:34.326
<i>Do it. Execute them all.</i>

00:38.622 --> 00:41.667
<i>This shocking video was released
earlier today</i>

00:41.750 --> 00:44.753
<i>on the controversial news website
TheDailyBugle.net.</i>

00:44.837 --> 00:46.839
<i>There you have it, folks: Conclusive proof</i>

00:46.922 --> 00:51.176
<i>that Spider-Man was responsible
for the brutal murder of Mysterio,</i>

00:51.260 --> 00:54.680
<i>an interdimensional warrior
who gave his life to protect our planet</i>

00:54.763 --> 01:00.310
<i>and who will, no doubt, go down in history
as the greatest superhero of all time.</i>

01:01.061 --> 01:02.604
<i>But that's not all, folks.</i>

01:02.688 --> 01:04.105
<i>Here's the real blockbuster.</i>

01:04.188 --> 01:05.899
<i>Brace yourselves.
You might wanna sit down.</i>

01:05.983 --> 01:08.277
<i>Spider-Man's real--
Spider-Man's real name is--</i>

01:10.404 --> 01:13.448
<i>Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker.</i>

01:14.491 --> 01:15.868
What the f--?

01:15.951 --> 01:18.704
<i>That's right, folks. Peter Parker.</i>

01:18.787 --> 01:21.582
<i>A 17-year-old high school delinquent...</i>

01:21.665 --> 01:24.334
-She knows him.
-Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?

01:24.418 --> 01:25.294
<i>...is, in fact...</i>

01:25.377 --> 01:29.173
-Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?
-<i>...the vile vigilante villain Spider-Man.</i>

01:29.256 --> 01:30.507
Yo, it's him.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.427
-Please don't touch her, sir.
-You're just a kid?

01:33.510 --> 01:35.137
You murdered Mysterio?

01:35.220 --> 01:36.638
-You helped him?
-No, I didn't--

01:36.722 --> 01:38.807
Come on, kid, let me see your face.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.642
-He hit me. Spider-Man hit me.
-Come on.

01:40.726 --> 01:41.560
He hit me.

01:41.643 --> 01:45.147
<i>All this time, people looked up
to this boy and called him a hero.</i>

01:45.230 --> 01:48.817
<i>Well, I'll tell you what I call him,
public enemy number one.</i>

01:49.318 --> 01:51.570
I told you
I never wanted to do this ever again!

01:52.154 --> 01:54.990
MJ, I'm so sorry, but I can't see anything
with your hand in my--

01:55.073 --> 01:56.617
Sorry. Where are we gonna go?

01:56.700 --> 01:58.493
-I don't know. Your house?
-No!

01:58.577 --> 02:00.120
My dad will kill you.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.997
What? You said your dad really liked me.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.832
Yeah, well, not anymore.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.377
-Dude.
-<i>Dude.</i>

02:07.461 --> 02:08.711
-Dude.
-<i>Dude.</i>

02:08.794 --> 02:09.795
Dude!

02:09.880 --> 02:11.924
-<i>Dude!
</i>-Dude!

02:13.634 --> 02:14.885
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.929
-No, not really.
-Yo, Peter!

02:25.479 --> 02:27.064
We should go. We should go. Come on.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.274
-You said you don't want to swing.
-You should just swing me.

02:29.358 --> 02:30.901
-Okay. We can take the subway.
-Okay.

02:35.030 --> 02:35.864
No.

02:41.787 --> 02:42.955
Look out!

02:51.755 --> 02:54.341
That was so much worse. Okay. It's okay.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.677
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.847
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, I'm so sorry.

03:10.148 --> 03:10.983
Okay.

03:11.608 --> 03:12.442
Okay.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.111
I'm sorry.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.949
I just feel so dumb.
I didn't realize you were miserable.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.411
No, it was really fun, right?
That's why they call it a fling.

03:22.494 --> 03:26.123
-And we flung.
-It was fun. I could've been more fun.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.625
-We'll hang out again.
-Like, when do you think?

03:31.628 --> 03:34.173
-I should see what that is.
-No, no, no.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.925
-It's what I do. Peter?
-He's always coming and going.

03:37.009 --> 03:37.926
-Peter?
-Oh, no.

03:38.010 --> 03:38.886
-Oh, God.
-Oh, no.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.637
-Peter? Peter?
-I don't know what to do.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.434
-I didn't see anything.
-This isn't what it looks like.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.227
-No, no, no, May.
-Practice safe--

03:47.311 --> 03:50.063
Oh, hey. You must be MJ.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.816
-Yeah. Nice to meet you.
-So nice to meet you.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.569
-Wait, have you been crying?
-We broke up.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.822
Hey, Spider-Man!

04:00.532 --> 04:02.159
Thank you. I didn't know you broke up.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.204
I thought you were in love, May.
Can we talk about this in the kitchen?

04:05.287 --> 04:06.830
I should probably leave.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.874
I thought you guys were
such a handsome couple.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.043
It's really about boundaries.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.462
-Let me answer the door.
-Let's go in here.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.047
-Is that the door?
-Hey. Is it true?

04:15.130 --> 04:17.048
-I was gonna go, but...
-Not now.

04:17.132 --> 04:20.093
I didn't know you were
so awkward about sex, Peter.

04:20.177 --> 04:22.095
This has nothing to do with sex.

04:22.179 --> 04:25.057
If you wanna go over it again.
I mean-- What's that sound?

04:26.934 --> 04:28.894
-Hey, Spider-Man!
-Oh, my God.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.439
I mean, I'm happy to rehash it
if you want to.

04:32.523 --> 04:35.192
You take care of your side,
I'll take care of mine.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.029
What is up with this phone?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.031
Will you get off your phones
for five minutes?

04:41.114 --> 04:43.408
I just wanna talk to you
about your relationship, okay?

04:43.492 --> 04:44.326
Peter?

04:47.538 --> 04:48.372
What?

04:50.207 --> 04:51.750
-Is that--?
-Is that here?

05:06.849 --> 05:09.142
-Yo, Peter Parker!
-Yo, Peter!

05:09.226 --> 05:11.186
Maybe it's not such a big deal.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.396
<i>Spider-Menace!</i>

05:12.980 --> 05:15.649
Governments around the world
launch investigations

05:15.732 --> 05:19.862
into the murderer known as Spider-Man,
aka Peter Parker,

05:19.945 --> 05:22.781
aka the web-headed war criminal

05:22.865 --> 05:27.244
who, for years, has been terrorizing
the decent citizens of New York.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.998
<i>Well, now this city and the world see him

05:31.081 --> 05:33.166
<i>Murderer! Mysterio forever!</i>

05:33.250 --> 05:37.379
New details from last week's
devastating attack in London have emerged.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.174
<i>For more, we go now
to Joint Intelligence headquarters.</i>

05:40.257 --> 05:42.926
<i>Authorities,
just a short while ago, confirmed</i>

05:43.010 --> 05:45.262
<i>that the deadly drones used
in the London attack</i>

05:45.345 --> 05:47.639
<i>were designed by Stark Industries.</i>

05:48.223 --> 05:49.641
Federal agents! Open up!

05:49.725 --> 05:51.518
Federal agents? You stay here.

05:52.436 --> 05:53.812
Department of Damage Control.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.731
We have a warrant
for the arrest of Peter Parker.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.399
-You know the Fourth Amendment?
-Sure.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.235
-Unreasonable search and seizure?
-Get in here, guys. Let's go.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.864
I didn't kill Quentin Beck.
The drones did, okay?

06:03.947 --> 06:05.782
-The drones that are yours.
-No.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.160
Nick Fury was there the entire time.

06:08.243 --> 06:09.953
He can explain everything.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.831
Nick Fury has been off-planet
for the last year.

06:12.915 --> 06:14.791
-What?
-Peter! Hey.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.003
MJ! They have nothing
to do with this, sir.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.172
Don't say anything without a lawyer.

06:20.756 --> 06:21.798
I want a lawyer.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.843
-Ms. Jones-Watson.
-Jones. I don't go by Watson.

06:25.511 --> 06:29.181
-Ms. Jones, why do you want a lawyer if--?
-If I have nothing to hide?

06:29.264 --> 06:32.351
-Exactly. Unless--
-I'm actually guilty of something?

06:32.434 --> 06:34.686
I'm very aware of your tactics
and my rights.

06:35.354 --> 06:37.231
Just answer my questions.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.024
I've seen your file.

06:39.107 --> 06:42.027
You're a smart young woman
with a bright future ahead of her.

06:42.778 --> 06:43.862
Why would you risk it all

06:43.946 --> 06:47.324
by getting involved
with a vigilante like Peter Parker?

06:48.367 --> 06:50.536
So sorry to keep you waiting.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.162
-Can we get Ned a snack?
-Absolutely.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.539
-He's been waiting.
-I got you.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.249
Dude, I'm so sorry about that.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.627
-I'm not supposed to say anything to you.
-Not even a thing.

06:58.710 --> 07:02.589
I just have one question.
When MJ told you Peter was Spider-Man--

07:03.757 --> 07:05.968
-What's up?
-I knew way before MJ did.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.554
-I was Spider-Man's "guy in the chair."
-I know about those.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.889
-Dude, half my guys are guys in the chair.
-Exactly.

07:10.973 --> 07:14.351
You would know.
I literally helped him find the Vulture.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.687
-I didn't know that.
-I helped him hack a suit once

07:16.770 --> 07:18.230
and helped him get to space.

07:18.313 --> 07:22.442
So in Spider-Man's illegal vigilantism,
you were his main accomplice.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.490
I would like to have
my words stricken from the record.

07:28.574 --> 07:32.119
With all due respect,
and I mean that very insincerely,

07:32.202 --> 07:35.289
unless you have
some real specific charges to throw at us,

07:35.372 --> 07:37.833
legally, you can't hold us here.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.544
-You should definitely lawyer up.
-Excuse me?

07:40.627 --> 07:42.754
Child endangerment's a nasty rap.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.590
A boy was entrusted to you,

07:44.673 --> 07:47.050
and as his legal guardian,
essentially his mother,

07:47.134 --> 07:51.096
you not only allowed him
to endanger himself, you encouraged it.

07:51.180 --> 07:52.848
Who does that?

07:52.931 --> 07:54.933
I wanna see Peter right now.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.603
<i>Stark Industries was caught in the web</i>

07:57.686 --> 08:00.480
<i>of the Spider-Man/Mysterio

08:00.564 --> 08:03.066
<i>when federal agents opened
an investigation</i>

08:03.150 --> 08:05.736
<i>into missing Stark technology.</i>

08:05.819 --> 08:08.447
<i>Agents wanna know
exactly what was taken...</i>

08:08.530 --> 08:11.742
-At least they used a good picture.
-What is happening?

08:14.494 --> 08:15.662
That's great.

08:15.746 --> 08:16.747
Thank you.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.540
I have some good news, Peter.

08:18.624 --> 08:21.251
I don't believe any of the charges
against you are gonna stick.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.586
Wait, seriously?

08:22.669 --> 08:23.712
-I knew it.
-Nice.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.380
Mr. Murdock, thank you.

08:25.464 --> 08:27.132
-Thank you.
-That's amazing.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.300
-You're welcome.
-Perfect.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.469
-However, Mr. Hogan...
-Yes?

08:30.552 --> 08:33.764
...the feds are investigating
that missing technology.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.183
I understand your loyalty
to Mr. Stark and his legacy,

08:36.265 --> 08:37.643
but if you were involved--

08:37.726 --> 08:39.477
-If I was?
-I advise securing a lawyer.

08:39.561 --> 08:42.606
I need a lawyer because I'm--?
I thought he was--

08:42.688 --> 08:45.859
You said there's no charge.
I could say under advisement of counsel,

08:45.943 --> 08:47.986
I refuse to answer
the question respectfully

08:48.070 --> 08:50.030
because the answer can incriminate me--

08:50.113 --> 08:52.616
It's in <i>Goodfellas.</i> What's the thing
they say in <i>Goodfellas?</i>

08:52.699 --> 08:55.953
I know that's what you think. Calm down.
Let's hear what he has to say. Matt?

08:56.036 --> 08:57.871
You're gonna need a really good lawyer.

08:58.789 --> 09:02.376
You may have dodged your legal troubles,
but things will get much worse.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.336

09:11.802 --> 09:13.303
How did you just do that?

09:14.096 --> 09:15.722

09:17.516 --> 09:19.685
We'll need a safer place to live.

10:15.449 --> 10:19.328
Yeah, but we'd have to get scholarships,

10:43.477 --> 10:45.562
-Really?
-What's that noise?

10:46.939 --> 10:48.649
<i>It's-- It's Happy. Look.</i>

10:48.732 --> 10:51.568
<i>Gave his room to May,
so he's sleeping down here.</i>

10:55.447 --> 10:57.157
I have a weird question.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.411
Does any part of you
feel relieved about this?

11:04.873 --> 11:07.125
Ever since I got bit by that spider...

11:08.669 --> 11:12.297
I've only had one week
where my life has felt normal.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.842
Or kind of normal, I guess.

11:15.384 --> 11:16.260
And...

11:17.886 --> 11:19.263
that was when you found out.

11:19.346 --> 11:23.976
<i>Because then everyone that was in my life
that I wanted to know knew.</i>

11:24.059 --> 11:25.102
<i>And it was perfect.</i>

11:25.185 --> 11:27.271
But now everybody knows and...

11:29.231 --> 11:32.484
I am the most famous person
in the entire world.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.153
And I'm still broke.

11:39.241 --> 11:40.075
I'm...

11:40.951 --> 11:43.078
excited to see you tomorrow.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.456
Yeah. Me too.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.791
Wrap it up.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.960
You both like each other.
We get it. Hang up.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.546
There's no new ground being broken.
I need my eight hours.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.132
-Have you been listening this whole time?
-<i>Hi, Happy.</i>

11:55.215 --> 11:56.216
Not by choice.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.510
-MJ says hi.
-Hello.

11:58.594 --> 12:00.888
We're covering
the first day of senior year

12:00.971 --> 12:03.348
for Midtown High's most famous student,

12:03.432 --> 12:04.808
Peter Parker.

12:04.892 --> 12:08.437
Go get them, tiger!
Or should I say "spider"?

12:08.520 --> 12:11.982
<i>The crowd has continued
to grow here all morning long</i>

12:12.065 --> 12:14.067
<i>at the Midtown School of Science...</i>

12:14.151 --> 12:18.113
<i>The crowd seems evenly divided
between supporters of Spider-Man</i>

12:18.197 --> 12:19.198
<i>and protestors.</i>

12:19.281 --> 12:20.991
MJ!

12:21.074 --> 12:23.327
MJ! MJ! We love you!

12:23.410 --> 12:25.829
MJ, are you gonna have his spider-babies?

12:25.913 --> 12:27.998
Back up. Back up. Back up!

12:28.957 --> 12:31.210
MJ, you know he's a murderer, right?

12:31.293 --> 12:32.920
Peter, do a TikTok with me.

12:33.003 --> 12:35.047
Mysterio forever!

12:35.130 --> 12:36.173
Do a flip!

12:36.256 --> 12:38.842
-Hey, let's see you and MJ kiss!
-Back off.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.093
Who are you?

12:40.177 --> 12:42.846
-Ned Leeds. Spider-Man's best friend.
-I'm Peter Parker's best friend.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.516
You come at my boy,
you come at Flash Thompson.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.643
If you wanna read
about our inspiring friendship,

12:47.726 --> 12:49.811
you can in my new book, <i>Flashpoint.</i>

12:49.895 --> 12:52.606
One spider, two hearts,
a million crazy-ass memories.

12:52.689 --> 12:53.941
Check it out.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.153
-Go.
-No, I gotta wait--

12:58.237 --> 13:00.572
-No. Go.
-I'll see you inside, okay?

13:02.324 --> 13:04.451
<i>Keep watching </i>Midtown News<i> all year</i>

13:04.535 --> 13:06.537
<i>as we bring you up close
and personal coverage</i>

13:06.620 --> 13:09.706
<i>of Peter fighting his biggest battle yet:</i>

13:09.790 --> 13:11.333
<i>College admissions.</i>

13:15.420 --> 13:16.505
Peter,

13:16.588 --> 13:20.968
we would love to welcome you
back to Midtown High,

13:21.051 --> 13:22.761
where we shape heroes.

13:23.345 --> 13:24.638
Or murderers.

13:24.721 --> 13:25.722
Stop it.

13:25.806 --> 13:29.476
-It's an honor to serve you, sir.
-It's not.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.894
Mysterio was right.

13:30.978 --> 13:32.688
-Stop. That's all.
-Mysterio was right.

13:32.771 --> 13:35.399
Some students put this together for you.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.277
-No, you did that.
-I helped a little bit.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.280
And I tried to stop you so many times,
but you powered through.

13:41.363 --> 13:42.781
-He did all of that.
-Did a great job.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.325
I hope you have time to check it out.

13:45.409 --> 13:48.120
Feel free to walk
or swing through the hallway.

13:48.203 --> 13:50.455
Or crawl on the ceiling
to avoid everybody.

13:50.539 --> 13:52.958
-We all know you can do it.
-I'm just gonna...

13:53.041 --> 13:55.460
-I know what you did.
-Stop. You're embarrassing yourself.

13:55.544 --> 13:57.171
He's a conspiracy theorist.

14:11.143 --> 14:13.145
Can we just stay up here all day?

14:13.228 --> 14:15.939
-It is so crazy down there.
-This one's good.

14:16.023 --> 14:19.109
"Some suggest that Parker's powers
include the male spider's ability

14:19.193 --> 14:20.819
to hypnotize females,

14:20.903 --> 14:25.282
which he used to seduce Jones-Watson
into his cult of personality."

14:25.365 --> 14:27.075
Stop. Stop.

14:27.159 --> 14:28.827
Yes, my Spider-Lord.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.962
Finally, some privacy.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.756
It is so crazy down there.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.217
So I was thinking...

14:43.884 --> 14:47.221
when we get into MIT,
we should live together.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.264
-Yeah, for sure.
-Yeah, I'd love that.

14:51.225 --> 14:54.853
-This is gonna be us.
-Yes. Minus the Frisbee and the smiling.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.605
MIT's obviously the dream,

14:56.688 --> 15:01.068
but if we match up our backup schools,
then either way, we'll be in Boston.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.153
New school, new town.
I can Spider-Man there.

15:03.237 --> 15:05.405
-They have crime in Boston, right?
-Yes.

15:05.489 --> 15:08.033
-Wicked crime.
-It'll be like a fresh start.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.078
What's up?

15:11.870 --> 15:13.789
I don't know.
I just feel like, if you don't--

15:14.498 --> 15:16.375
If you expect disappointment,

15:16.458 --> 15:18.961
then you can never really
get disappointed.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.170
Come on.

15:21.338 --> 15:24.550
Be a fresh start.
And we'll all be together.

15:26.134 --> 15:28.428
Yeah. No, you're right. Fresh start.

15:28.512 --> 15:29.346
Yeah.

15:32.307 --> 15:33.392
Fresh start.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.312
First one's here!

15:41.900 --> 15:43.652
It's okay. It's a backup.

15:45.028 --> 15:45.946
Peter.

15:48.282 --> 15:49.116
No?

15:51.910 --> 15:52.786
Last one.

15:54.663 --> 15:55.622
MIT?

16:00.377 --> 16:01.211
Okay.

16:12.806 --> 16:13.640
Okay.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.476
-Ready?
-Jones,

16:16.560 --> 16:19.188
I told you to take down
the Halloween decorations.

16:19.271 --> 16:22.482
-Actually, that was Sasha, so--
-Enough attitude. Just do it.

16:23.817 --> 16:24.651
On it.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.487
Feel like I'm gonna puke.

16:27.571 --> 16:30.199
Don't because he will
just make me clean it.

16:30.282 --> 16:32.868
This is our only shot.
It's here or nowhere.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.037
-Hey. Come on.
-Okay. You ready?

16:35.120 --> 16:37.080
-Yeah.
-Okay, on three.

16:37.748 --> 16:40.542
One, two, three.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.067
No.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.194
No. You?

17:08.278 --> 17:10.364
"In light of recent controversy,

17:10.446 --> 17:15.035
we are unable to consider
your application at this time."

17:15.661 --> 17:16.869
This is so not fair.

17:17.371 --> 17:19.915
I mean, this is so not fair.
I didn't do anything wrong.

17:19.998 --> 17:22.084
You guys definitely didn't do
anything wrong.

17:22.166 --> 17:25.712
Expect disappointment
and you will never get disappointed.

17:27.339 --> 17:29.216
<i>No sleep till</i>

17:32.427 --> 17:33.679
<i>Boston</i>

17:39.142 --> 17:40.018
You didn't get in?

17:40.102 --> 17:42.604
Yeah, because we're actually friends
with Spider-Man.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.150
Yeah. I better get going.

17:47.234 --> 17:50.279
There's a mixer for new admissions and--

17:50.362 --> 17:51.572
Sorry, guys.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.199
Jones, what are you doing?
Get back to work.

17:54.283 --> 17:55.284
Yeah, I'm coming.

17:55.909 --> 17:56.827
Know what?

17:58.745 --> 18:00.372
I wouldn't change a thing I did.

18:01.790 --> 18:02.624
Me neither.

18:06.295 --> 18:08.755
Although I do need
to show this letter to my parents.

19:19.576 --> 19:20.410
Hi.

19:23.622 --> 19:24.456
Hi?

19:25.707 --> 19:26.542
I'm--

19:27.292 --> 19:30.212
The most famous person
in the world. I know.

19:31.547 --> 19:35.425
Wong. Try not to slip.
We don't have liability insurance.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.139
-Is all this for a holiday party?
-No.

19:41.223 --> 19:44.309
One of the rotunda gateways
connects to Siberia.

19:44.393 --> 19:46.019
A blizzard blasted through.

19:48.105 --> 19:50.774
Because someone forgot
to cast a monthly maintenance spell

19:50.858 --> 19:52.276
to keep the seals tight.

19:52.359 --> 19:55.487
That's right, he did, because he forgot
I now have higher duties.

19:55.571 --> 19:56.697
Higher duties?

19:56.780 --> 19:58.991
The Sorcerer Supreme has higher duties.

19:59.074 --> 20:01.243
Wait, I thought
you were the Sorcerer Supreme.

20:01.326 --> 20:04.830
No, he got it on a technicality
'cause I blipped for five years.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.624
-Congratulations.
-If I'd been here, then--

20:07.708 --> 20:08.917
You'd burn the place down.

20:09.001 --> 20:11.336
You two, no one said stop shoveling.

20:11.420 --> 20:14.006
So, Peter, to what do I owe the pleasure?

20:14.631 --> 20:17.759
Right. I'm really sorry
to bother you, sir.

20:17.843 --> 20:19.803
Please. We saved half
the universe together.

20:19.887 --> 20:23.515
-Think we're beyond you calling me "sir."
-Okay, Stephen.

20:23.599 --> 20:25.184
That feels weird, but I'll allow it.

20:28.061 --> 20:28.896
When...

20:29.813 --> 20:31.940
When Mysterio revealed my identity,

20:32.900 --> 20:36.653
my entire life got screwed up
and I was wondering--

20:36.737 --> 20:39.656
I don't know if this would actually work,
but I was wondering if...

20:41.617 --> 20:44.661
maybe you could go back in time
and make it so he never did?

20:46.330 --> 20:50.125
Peter, we tampered
with the stability of space-time

20:50.209 --> 20:52.002
to resurrect countless lives.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.338
You wanna do it again now
just 'cause yours got messy?

20:54.421 --> 20:55.797
It's not about me.

20:55.881 --> 20:57.966
This is really hurting a lot of people.

20:58.050 --> 21:01.053
My Aunt May, Happy,

21:01.136 --> 21:02.554
my best friend, my girlfriend,

21:02.638 --> 21:04.556
their futures are ruined
just because they know me,

21:04.640 --> 21:06.725
and they've done nothing wrong.

21:06.808 --> 21:08.810
I am so sorry...

21:09.895 --> 21:11.230
but even if I wanted to...

21:12.105 --> 21:14.483
I don't have the Time Stone anymore.

21:16.818 --> 21:17.819
That's right.

21:21.573 --> 21:25.160
I'm really sorry if I wasted your time.

21:25.244 --> 21:27.287
-You didn't.
-Just forget about it.

21:27.371 --> 21:30.207
Oh, he will. He's very good
at forgetting things.

21:31.792 --> 21:34.711
Wong, you've actually generated
a good idea.

21:34.795 --> 21:35.796
What?

21:35.879 --> 21:37.965
The Runes of Kof-Kol.

21:38.048 --> 21:39.633
The Runes of Kof-Kol?

21:39.716 --> 21:42.052
It's just a standard spell of forgetting.

21:42.135 --> 21:45.097
Won't turn back time, but people will
forget you were ever Spider-Man.

21:45.180 --> 21:47.099
-Seriously?
-No, not seriously.

21:47.182 --> 21:50.769
That spell travels the dark borders
between known and unknown reality.

21:50.853 --> 21:52.062
It's too dangerous.

21:53.063 --> 21:54.773
We've used it for a lot less.

21:54.857 --> 21:56.984
Do you remember
the full moon party at Kamar-Taj?

21:57.067 --> 21:58.610
-No.
-Exactly.

22:02.072 --> 22:03.615
Come on, Wong.

22:05.117 --> 22:06.910
Hasn't he been through enough?

22:14.042 --> 22:15.586
Just leave me out of this.

22:16.461 --> 22:17.296
Fine.

22:18.714 --> 22:19.548
Fine.

22:31.768 --> 22:33.145
So, what is this place?

22:34.146 --> 22:38.025
The Sanctum's built at the intersection
of cosmic energy currents.

22:38.108 --> 22:39.735
We weren't the first to seek them out.

22:40.444 --> 22:42.863
Some of these walls
are thousands of years old.

22:43.822 --> 22:47.492
And they shot an episode
of <i>The Equalizer</i> here in the '80s.

22:47.576 --> 22:48.410
Well, I...

22:50.454 --> 22:52.331
really appreciate you
doing this for me, sir.

22:53.123 --> 22:54.249
Don't mention it.

22:56.001 --> 22:57.628
And don't call me "sir."

22:58.754 --> 22:59.630
Right. Sorry.

23:00.464 --> 23:01.632
You ready?

23:02.674 --> 23:03.509
I'm ready.

23:05.761 --> 23:07.221
Nice knowing you, Spider-Man.

23:11.934 --> 23:12.851
Wait, excuse me?

23:14.937 --> 23:18.148
The entire world's about to forget
that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.

23:18.941 --> 23:20.526
-Including me.
-Everyone?

23:21.860 --> 23:24.988
-Can't some people still know?
-That's not how the spell works.

23:25.072 --> 23:28.951
And it's very difficult and dangerous
to change it mid-casting.

23:29.034 --> 23:31.161
So my girlfriend's gonna
forget everything?

23:31.245 --> 23:32.746
Is she even gonna be my girlfriend?

23:32.829 --> 23:35.207
Was she your girlfriend
just 'cause you were Spider-Man?

23:35.290 --> 23:37.751
-I don't know. I really hope not.
-All right, fine.

23:39.253 --> 23:43.298
Everyone's gonna forget
you're Spider-Man except your girlfriend.

23:43.382 --> 23:44.508
Thank you so much.

23:45.259 --> 23:47.135
Oh, my God, Ned. Ned.

23:48.679 --> 23:50.138
What is a Ned?

23:50.222 --> 23:53.058
He's my best friend,
so it's important to me that Ned knows.

23:57.396 --> 24:01.942
Okay, let's not change
the parameters of this spell any more

24:02.025 --> 24:03.819
-while I'm casting it.
-Okay, I'm done.

24:03.902 --> 24:05.112
I swear, I'm done. I'm done.

24:05.737 --> 24:08.866
-But my Aunt May should really know.
-Peter, stop tampering with the spell.

24:08.949 --> 24:11.368
When she found out I was Spider-Man,
it was really messy.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.662
I don't think
I could go through that again.

24:14.955 --> 24:16.331
-So my Aunt May?
-Yes.

24:16.415 --> 24:17.708
Thank you. Happy?

24:17.791 --> 24:19.001
No, I'm annoyed.

24:19.084 --> 24:21.044
No, it's a nickname. Harold "Happy" Hogan.

24:21.128 --> 24:23.255
He used to work with Tony Stark,
but then he was...

24:23.338 --> 24:25.007
Would you just stop talking?

24:33.098 --> 24:37.436
Basically, everyone that knew
I was Spider-Man before should still know!

24:57.998 --> 24:59.208
-Did it work?
-No.

24:59.291 --> 25:02.377
You changed my spell six times.

25:02.461 --> 25:04.087
-Five times.
-You changed my spell.

25:04.171 --> 25:07.508
You don't do that.
I told you. And that is why.

25:07.591 --> 25:10.260
That spell was out of control.
If I hadn't shut it down,

25:10.344 --> 25:12.679
something catastrophic
could have happened.

25:12.763 --> 25:15.390
-Stephen, listen, I am so--
-Call me "sir."

25:17.935 --> 25:19.144
Sorry, sir.

25:20.646 --> 25:25.567
After everything we've been through,
somehow I always forget you're just a kid.

25:26.568 --> 25:29.655
Look, Parker, the problem is not Mysterio.

25:29.738 --> 25:31.990
It's you trying
to live two different lives.

25:32.074 --> 25:34.535
And the longer you do that,
the more dangerous it becomes.

25:34.618 --> 25:35.827
Believe me.

25:35.911 --> 25:39.748
I'm so sorry about you
and your friends not getting into college,

25:39.831 --> 25:44.461
but if they rejected you and you tried
to convince them to reconsider,

25:44.545 --> 25:46.713
there's nothing else you can do.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.802
When you say "convince them,"

25:51.885 --> 25:54.513
-you mean, I could have called them?
-Yeah.

25:55.013 --> 25:56.139
I could do that?

25:57.724 --> 25:59.560
You haven't called the...?

25:59.643 --> 26:01.395
I got their letter. I assumed that was--

26:01.478 --> 26:02.604
I'm sorry.

26:03.146 --> 26:04.439
Are you telling me

26:04.982 --> 26:07.776
that you didn't even think
to plead your case with them first

26:07.860 --> 26:11.613
before you asked me
to brainwash the entire world?

26:14.575 --> 26:16.285
When you put it like that...

26:24.126 --> 26:25.711
Come on, pick up, pick up.

26:25.794 --> 26:27.171
Dude, what? I'm busy.

26:27.254 --> 26:29.506
-Flash, where's the MIT mixer?
-<i>Why?</i>

26:29.590 --> 26:31.091
Because I need to talk to someone.

26:31.175 --> 26:33.093
I'm trying to get Ned and MJ
a second chance at getting in.

26:33.177 --> 26:34.386
What's in it for me?

26:34.469 --> 26:36.180
<i>I'm risking a lot just talking to you.</i>

26:36.263 --> 26:37.723
Okay, I will...

26:39.683 --> 26:41.977
pick you up and swing you
to school for one week?

26:42.060 --> 26:42.895
For a month.

26:43.437 --> 26:45.189
-<i>For a week.
</i>-Two weeks.

26:45.272 --> 26:47.524
-Flash, please. Help me.
-You know what I want.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.612
Okay, I'll tell everyone
you're my best friend.

26:51.695 --> 26:53.655
-<i>Flash, please, help me.
</i>-Cool.

26:53.739 --> 26:56.742
<i>There's the assistant vice chancellor.
You can plead your case with her.</i>

26:56.825 --> 26:58.535
-Okay, perfect. Where is she?
-She left.

26:58.619 --> 27:00.370
-To go where?
-To the airport.

27:07.044 --> 27:08.921
<i>Stark network unavailable.</i>

27:09.588 --> 27:12.049
<i>Facial recognition unavailable.</i>

27:15.302 --> 27:16.303
Hi.

27:18.263 --> 27:20.140
Yeah, I can see you.

27:30.234 --> 27:31.360
Oh, my God!

27:33.695 --> 27:35.322
-That's Peter Parker.
-Mom.

27:35.405 --> 27:36.990
-Mom, look.
-Mommy.

27:37.074 --> 27:38.659
No, it's Peter Parker.

27:48.335 --> 27:49.169
Hey!

27:49.920 --> 27:50.754
Okay.

28:01.765 --> 28:02.766
Yeah.

28:03.433 --> 28:04.726
Hi. I'm Peter Parker.

28:04.810 --> 28:07.354
-You do know you're in the street, right?
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

28:07.437 --> 28:10.607
I really needed to talk to you and I know
you're on your way to the airport.

28:10.691 --> 28:14.236
MJ Watson and Ned Leeds are
the two smartest people I've ever met,

28:14.319 --> 28:16.697
and I'm the dumbest person
because I let them help me,

28:16.780 --> 28:18.699
but if I didn't, millions would've died,

28:18.782 --> 28:20.909
so please don't let MIT be dumb like me.

28:20.993 --> 28:21.994
MIT is dumb?

28:22.077 --> 28:24.997
No, I'm saying, don't let MIT be dumb.

28:25.080 --> 28:29.626
I mean, like the dumber version of me
that wouldn't have let them help.

28:31.336 --> 28:33.755
You didn't rehearse that, did you, Peter?

28:34.631 --> 28:36.175
Basically, what I'm trying to--

28:44.266 --> 28:45.475
Why are you running?

28:49.563 --> 28:50.564
Oh, my God.

28:51.231 --> 28:53.192
Ma'am, you should get out of the car.

28:53.275 --> 28:55.444
Everybody get off the bridge!

28:57.362 --> 28:58.447
The door's locked.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.199
Door's-- Hey!

29:17.174 --> 29:18.383
Hello, Peter.

29:19.468 --> 29:21.428
Hi? Do we--? Do I know you?

29:21.512 --> 29:23.764
What have you done with my machine?

29:23.847 --> 29:26.683
I don't know what you're talking about.
What machine?

29:26.767 --> 29:29.603
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

29:30.187 --> 29:31.104
It's gone.

29:31.188 --> 29:33.273
Listen, if you stop smashing cars,

29:33.357 --> 29:35.984
we can work together
and I can help you find your machine.

29:36.068 --> 29:37.569
You want to play games?

29:40.239 --> 29:41.532
Catch!

29:58.423 --> 30:00.843
It's okay. You guys are good.
You're safe. Get out of here.

30:00.926 --> 30:03.637
You think
your fancy new suit's gonna save you?

30:18.527 --> 30:21.488
Should've killed your little girlfriend
when I had the chance.

30:25.450 --> 30:26.869
What did you just say?

30:26.952 --> 30:29.121
Looks like we got competition.

30:49.057 --> 30:50.225
Peter!

30:50.309 --> 30:51.351
Help!

31:13.248 --> 31:15.667
Don't worry, ma'am! I'm coming!

31:17.503 --> 31:18.754
Peter!

31:45.614 --> 31:47.157
Ma'am, just stay calm.

31:47.241 --> 31:48.408
Just take a deep breath.

31:48.492 --> 31:50.160
-Are you okay?
-No!

31:52.538 --> 31:55.082
I promise,
I've got this all under control.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.465
<i>Suit compromised.</i>

32:04.091 --> 32:05.551
Nanotechnology.

32:06.301 --> 32:08.554
Ah, you've outdone yourself, Peter.

32:14.852 --> 32:16.436
I underestimated you.

32:17.771 --> 32:19.106
But now you die.

32:35.539 --> 32:36.957
You're not Peter Parker.

32:37.791 --> 32:39.418
I am so confused right now.

32:42.171 --> 32:43.255
What's happening?

32:43.338 --> 32:44.798
<i>New device detected.</i>

32:47.009 --> 32:48.177
<i>Pairing new device.</i>

32:52.055 --> 32:54.933
You don't listen to him. You listen to me.

33:00.814 --> 33:01.690
Hey.

33:14.828 --> 33:16.538
Hey. Hey.

33:16.622 --> 33:17.748
Listen to me.

33:18.540 --> 33:20.459
No, not him. Me.

33:27.341 --> 33:28.634
Ma'am, you okay?

33:28.717 --> 33:30.260
You can still make your flight.

33:31.303 --> 33:32.221
Peter.

33:33.931 --> 33:35.015
You're a hero.

33:35.098 --> 33:36.350
No. Well, I'm--

33:36.433 --> 33:37.518
No, I'm--

33:37.601 --> 33:40.395
I'm gonna talk to Admissions
about your friends.

33:40.479 --> 33:41.897
And I'm gonna talk to them about you.

33:42.981 --> 33:45.150
But, ma'am, this isn't about me.

33:45.234 --> 33:49.196
I am going to talk to them
about your friends and you.

33:49.279 --> 33:50.864
-Okay?
-Really?

33:50.948 --> 33:53.951
And if you keep your noses clean,
maybe you'll have a fair shot.

33:54.034 --> 33:55.869
Here. Get out of the way.
Let me get that man.

33:55.953 --> 33:58.622
Hey. You. I see you. Come here!

33:58.705 --> 33:59.998
That was not okay.

34:00.082 --> 34:01.166
Unbelievable.

34:02.584 --> 34:03.836
Who are--?

34:03.919 --> 34:05.087
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

34:05.170 --> 34:08.047
Until you stop trying to kill me,
I'm in control, buddy,

34:08.130 --> 34:11.802
of this whole tentacle situation
you got going on here, okay?

34:11.885 --> 34:13.887
Now, who are you? What is going--?

34:23.272 --> 34:24.147
No.

34:31.196 --> 34:32.406
Osborn?

34:55.304 --> 34:56.138
Doctor--?

35:04.021 --> 35:08.233
Be careful what you wish for, Parker.

35:08.317 --> 35:09.860
Let me out of here!

35:09.943 --> 35:11.987
Can you please explain to me
what is going on?

35:12.070 --> 35:13.697
That little spell that you botched

35:13.780 --> 35:16.575
where you wanted everyone
to forget that Peter Parker's Spider-Man,

35:16.658 --> 35:19.578
it started pulling in everyone
who knows Peter Parker's Spider-Man

35:19.661 --> 35:22.331
from every universe into this one.

35:23.415 --> 35:26.376
-From every universe?
-Who are you? And where am I?

35:26.460 --> 35:28.962
I think it's better we don't engage
with them because, frankly,

35:29.046 --> 35:33.175
the multiverse is a concept
about which we know frighteningly little.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.260
The multiverse is real?

35:36.094 --> 35:37.763
This shouldn't be possible.

35:37.846 --> 35:40.098
-I thought you stopped the spell.
-No, I contained it.

35:40.182 --> 35:42.434
It would appear
a few of them squeaked through.

35:42.518 --> 35:44.811
After you left,
I detected an otherworldly presence.

35:44.895 --> 35:47.648
I pursued it into the sewers,
where I found that...

35:48.315 --> 35:50.734
slimy, green son of a gun.

35:50.817 --> 35:53.111
Spell? As in magic?

35:53.695 --> 35:55.614
What is this, a birthday party?

35:55.697 --> 35:58.200
Who is this clown? What is this madness?

35:58.283 --> 36:01.662
Watch this. Do you know
a Peter Parker who's Spider-Man?

36:01.745 --> 36:03.205
-Yes.
-Is that him?

36:03.288 --> 36:04.790
-No.
-See?

36:06.375 --> 36:07.918
Here's what we gotta do.

36:08.001 --> 36:10.337
I don't know how many visitors we've got--

36:10.420 --> 36:12.965
I saw another one on the bridge.

36:13.048 --> 36:16.510
He was like a flying green elf.

36:16.593 --> 36:18.595
He sounds jolly. Start with him.

36:18.679 --> 36:21.348
I need you to capture them,
bring them here while I figure out

36:21.431 --> 36:25.102
how to get them back
before they destroy the fabric of reality,

36:25.185 --> 36:26.979
or worse, Wong finds out.

36:27.813 --> 36:29.147
Doctor Strange?

36:29.231 --> 36:30.065
What?

36:30.566 --> 36:33.944
My friends and I just got
a second chance to get into MIT,

36:34.027 --> 36:36.822
and if the school sees me
fighting these crazy monsters--

36:36.905 --> 36:38.615
-Hey, watch your mouth.
-I'm sorry, but--

36:38.699 --> 36:40.909
Are you seriously
still talking about college?

36:46.665 --> 36:48.959
-Hey, what did you just do?
-This.

36:50.627 --> 36:51.920
Hey, you can't just--

36:54.923 --> 36:57.843
-How did you do that?
-Lots of birthday parties.

37:04.224 --> 37:05.601
Hey.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.856
One shot, send them here, move on.
You're welcome.

37:10.939 --> 37:12.566
-Get to work.
-Sir?

37:13.442 --> 37:14.443
Now what?

37:15.569 --> 37:18.280
This is my mess,
and I swear that I'll fix it,

37:18.363 --> 37:19.907
but I'm gonna need help.

37:22.826 --> 37:25.537
I can't believe
I'm in the Sanctum Sanctorum.

37:25.621 --> 37:26.830
Neither can I.

37:27.497 --> 37:30.042
So how did you know
you were a man of magic?

37:30.125 --> 37:32.294
Because my nana says
that we have it in our family,

37:32.377 --> 37:35.422
-and I get these tinglings in my hands--
-Talk to your physician.

37:35.506 --> 37:36.840
-Peter.
-Hey.

37:36.924 --> 37:38.717
-Hey. Hey.
-Hey. Hey.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.344
Sorry for dragging you into this.

37:40.427 --> 37:43.222
-Help me find these guys.
-You don't have to apologize, okay?

37:43.305 --> 37:45.390
You got us
a second shot at MIT. It's fine.

37:45.474 --> 37:48.101
So how did the bad guys get here?

37:48.185 --> 37:51.271
We screwed up a spell
trying to get you into college.

37:51.355 --> 37:54.107
-You did it with magic?
-I thought it was the MIT lady you saved.

37:54.858 --> 37:57.444
No, that was after.
Let's just focus on the good news, okay?

37:57.528 --> 37:59.238
No, let's just focus on the bad news.

37:59.321 --> 38:03.408
As of now, you have detected
zero multiversal trespassers,

38:03.492 --> 38:07.746
so get on your phones,
scour the Internet, and...

38:07.829 --> 38:09.414
Scooby-Doo this shit.

38:10.165 --> 38:14.127
You're telling us what to do, even though
it was your spell that got screwed up,

38:14.211 --> 38:16.296
meaning that all this is your mess.

38:16.380 --> 38:21.134
I know a couple of magic words myself,
starting with the word "please."

38:24.012 --> 38:26.557
Please Scooby-Doo this shit.

38:27.266 --> 38:29.142
You can work in the undercroft.

38:29.685 --> 38:32.020
The undercroft?

38:36.900 --> 38:37.943
Badass.

38:44.700 --> 38:47.661
-About this whole spell thing--
-It's totally okay.

38:47.744 --> 38:49.746
-Really?
-Yeah. I mean, I get it.

38:49.830 --> 38:54.626
You were just trying
to fix things, and so...

38:54.710 --> 38:57.421
Maybe just run it by us next time,
you know?

38:57.504 --> 38:59.965
That way, when you're thinking,
"I'm about to do something

39:00.048 --> 39:02.718
that could break the universe,"

39:02.801 --> 39:06.054
we could, like, help you
workshop something or...

39:06.680 --> 39:09.308
brainstorm ideas.

39:11.435 --> 39:12.269
Deal.

39:13.854 --> 39:14.897
Ned?

39:15.647 --> 39:18.817
Oh, dude, I don't care.
It's seriously not a big deal.

39:20.944 --> 39:23.071
A torture rack.

39:24.865 --> 39:26.450
That is a Pilates machine.

39:27.242 --> 39:28.577
-That is--
-The crypt.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.829
Okay, so we get the rest of the guys,

39:30.913 --> 39:32.915
you zap them,
Doctor Magic will send them back,

39:32.998 --> 39:37.002
and when we get into MIT,
round of stale doughnuts, my treat.

39:37.085 --> 39:38.795
Let's catch some multiverse men.

39:38.879 --> 39:41.840
Hey! Who the hell are these two?

39:41.924 --> 39:44.468
-My friends. This is MJ. And this is Ned.
-Hey.

39:44.551 --> 39:45.385
Hello.

39:46.136 --> 39:49.348
-Sorry, what was your name again?
-Dr. Otto Octavius.

39:54.353 --> 39:56.063
Seriously, what's your actual name?

39:56.146 --> 39:57.648
Oh, is that a dinosaur?

40:19.628 --> 40:21.755
<i>If the paint won't come off,
I'll get it out.</i>

40:21.839 --> 40:24.842
No, no, no, May.
We gotta find these guys first.

40:24.925 --> 40:27.010
<i>Finish your mission and then come by.</i>

40:27.094 --> 40:28.554
<i>We're having a canned food drive.</i>

40:29.263 --> 40:31.348
-That could work.
-I got one.

40:31.431 --> 40:32.766
-I gotta go.
-<i>Okay.</i>

40:32.850 --> 40:34.935
I mean, you can take
the guy out of the chair,

40:35.018 --> 40:37.145
but you can't take
the chair out of the guy.

40:37.229 --> 40:39.606
-What'd you find?
-There's a...

40:39.690 --> 40:43.360
A disturbance near a military
research facility outside of the city,

40:43.443 --> 40:47.239
and witnesses say that they saw
a monster flying through the air.

40:48.657 --> 40:50.701
It's gotta be the guy I saw on the bridge.

40:50.784 --> 40:52.077
That's impossible.

40:54.663 --> 40:55.789
You know him, don't you?

40:57.040 --> 40:59.042
On the bridge, you said his name.

41:00.377 --> 41:01.712
Norman Osborn.

41:02.588 --> 41:05.841
Brilliant scientist. Military research.

41:07.092 --> 41:09.845
But he was greedy, misguided.

41:10.554 --> 41:14.183
-What happened to him?
-We tire of your questions, boy!

41:15.517 --> 41:16.351
Okay.

41:17.728 --> 41:20.898
-I gotta go. Where am I going?
-It can't be him.

41:23.150 --> 41:24.318
Why?

41:24.401 --> 41:27.863
Because Norman Osborn died years ago.

41:29.114 --> 41:31.283
So either we saw someone else...

41:32.868 --> 41:37.748
or you're flying out
into the darkness to fight a ghost.

42:01.188 --> 42:03.941
Keep an eye out on the trees.
We don't know where this guy is.

42:07.110 --> 42:09.821
I genuinely don't know
how you do this without throwing up.

42:27.881 --> 42:29.049
Did you see that?

42:30.467 --> 42:32.594
<i>-No.
-It's really dark.</i>

42:45.065 --> 42:46.775
Okay, okay, okay.

42:53.657 --> 42:54.867
<i>What's happening?</i>

42:54.950 --> 42:56.034
<i>Peter, what is it?</i>

42:58.495 --> 43:00.038
<i>Are you getting the tingle thing?</i>

43:00.122 --> 43:02.541
<i>Is the tingle happening?
Is your tingle tingling?</i>

43:11.633 --> 43:13.552
-Are you guys seeing this?
-<i>Yeah.</i>

43:14.303 --> 43:16.680
-<i>Osborn?
</i>-No. He was green. This guy's blue.

43:18.307 --> 43:21.185
You wouldn't happen to be
from another universe, would you?

43:22.269 --> 43:23.645
<i>What's he doing?</i>

43:23.729 --> 43:26.899
-<i>I don't know. Looks like he's charging.
</i>-I don't like this. Just web him.

43:39.870 --> 43:43.123
<i>Go left! Left, dude, left!
Left! Go! Left! Yes!</i>

43:43.207 --> 43:47.085
<i>What are you talking about? Right.
Go to the right! Right! Right!</i>

43:47.169 --> 43:50.923
-<i>He means right. Don't listen to him.
</i>-This is not helping!

43:57.429 --> 44:00.224
Oh, no, no, no.
What happened? Peter? Peter.

44:08.941 --> 44:13.445
Peter, it's me, Flint Marko. You remember?

44:13.529 --> 44:16.698
-I'm Peter, but I'm not your Peter.
-What do you mean, you're not my Peter?

44:16.782 --> 44:20.786
-What the hell is going on?
-I'll explain, but first, can you help me?

44:20.869 --> 44:22.746
-Okay.
-You try to surround him,

44:22.829 --> 44:24.873
and I'll pull the plug.
All right, let's go!

44:39.096 --> 44:41.890
I can't hold him much longer.

44:42.850 --> 44:44.393
I got it, I got it!

45:12.087 --> 45:14.381
Different Peter. Weird.

45:14.464 --> 45:17.509
-Thanks. Sorry.
-Don't worry about it.

45:25.809 --> 45:27.227
I got my body back.

45:28.145 --> 45:28.979
Hey.

45:29.938 --> 45:33.692
This is gonna sound really crazy,
but this isn't your universe.

45:33.775 --> 45:34.818
Another universe?

45:35.485 --> 45:37.029
-What?
-That's what I was feeling.

45:37.988 --> 45:40.115
The power, it's different.

45:41.867 --> 45:42.868
I like it.

45:45.078 --> 45:48.457
-Easy, buddy.
-It's actually my fault that you're here.

45:48.540 --> 45:51.627
Like, the universe or the woods?

45:52.461 --> 45:53.378
I hate the woods.

45:53.462 --> 45:55.380
I meant, the universe, sir.

45:55.464 --> 45:58.842
So, what, y'all just gonna stand here
and act like I ain't butt-ass naked?

45:58.926 --> 46:00.636
-I am.
-No, no.

46:01.220 --> 46:02.221
I...

46:14.191 --> 46:16.860
What was that?
What did you just do to him?

46:16.944 --> 46:18.946
-No. It's okay.
-Did you kill him?

46:19.029 --> 46:21.114
I can explain everything. Trust me.

46:21.198 --> 46:23.951
-Please, just trust me.
-I don't trust you. I don't know you.

46:27.079 --> 46:28.163
What is this?

46:29.498 --> 46:31.083
You picked the wrong side.

46:33.752 --> 46:34.920
Connors?

46:36.421 --> 46:38.590
Wait. You know this creature?

46:38.674 --> 46:41.718
No, no, no. Not a creature. A man.

46:42.845 --> 46:44.012
The same universes.

46:44.096 --> 46:48.141
Dr. Curt Connors. He was a scientist
at Oscorp when I worked there.

46:48.225 --> 46:50.269
A brilliant scientist.

46:50.352 --> 46:51.979
Until he turned himself into a lizard.

46:52.062 --> 46:54.189
Then he tried to turn
the whole city into lizards.

46:54.273 --> 46:56.692
-It was crazy.
-It wasn't crazy, Max.

46:56.775 --> 46:58.902
It was the next step in human evolution.

46:58.986 --> 47:01.071
-The dinosaur can talk. Right.
-Lizard.

47:01.154 --> 47:02.739
What happened to you?

47:02.823 --> 47:06.577
Last I recall, you had bad teeth,
glasses and a comb-over.

47:06.660 --> 47:08.453
Did you get a makeover?

47:09.288 --> 47:11.790
You know I can give you a real makeover.

47:11.874 --> 47:13.250
Let me guess, into a lizard?

47:13.333 --> 47:15.919
-Exactly.
-Would you two just shut up?

47:16.003 --> 47:17.713
-Where are we?
-It's complicated.

47:17.796 --> 47:20.424
-A wizard's dungeon.
-Wizard's dungeon?

47:20.507 --> 47:24.178
There's no real way to sugarcoat that.
It's literally the dungeon of a wizard.

47:24.261 --> 47:25.762
You can keep your magic.

47:26.930 --> 47:29.558
I want a taste of that energy I just felt.

47:33.020 --> 47:35.981
-Oh, Peter, hey.
-Did those guys come through yet?

47:36.064 --> 47:38.066
There should be an electric guy
and a sand guy.

47:38.150 --> 47:40.694
Yeah, they're all here and locked up.

47:40.777 --> 47:43.697
Perfect. I'm gonna just stay here
and try and fix some of this damage,

47:43.780 --> 47:45.532
so they don't blame it on me again.

47:45.616 --> 47:47.451
-<i>Okay.
</i>-But, hey, I...

47:48.952 --> 47:51.663
I couldn't do any of this without you,
so thank you.

47:51.747 --> 47:52.581
<i>Of course.</i>

47:53.332 --> 47:55.959
Hey, ask him
if this is like a tree monster

47:56.043 --> 47:58.420
or like a scientist
that turned into a tree.

47:58.504 --> 47:59.838
It's just a tree, man.

48:00.714 --> 48:01.924
Just a tree.

48:18.607 --> 48:22.444
<i>Coward. We have a new world to conquer.</i>

48:24.404 --> 48:25.864
<i>You make me sick.</i>

48:25.948 --> 48:27.741
Leave me alone, please.

48:27.824 --> 48:30.452
<i>Hiding in the shadows.</i>

48:30.994 --> 48:33.247
<i>Hiding from who you truly are.</i>

48:33.330 --> 48:36.875
-No.
-<i>You can't escape yourself.</i>

48:52.850 --> 48:55.435
-Hey, May.
-<i>Hey, Peter. I'm at work, and...</i>

48:56.395 --> 48:58.522
<i>one of the guys
you're looking for just walked in.</i>

49:07.573 --> 49:10.075
May? Where's May? Thank you.

49:13.453 --> 49:14.288
May.

49:16.415 --> 49:18.166
Hey, here he is.

49:18.250 --> 49:21.503
Norman, this is my nephew.

49:23.046 --> 49:25.632
Norman Osborn? I thought that you were--

49:25.716 --> 49:29.303
I saw Spider-Man in an ad for this place.

49:30.262 --> 49:32.139
And I thought he could help me.

49:32.764 --> 49:34.057
But you're not him.

49:34.141 --> 49:36.476
Wait, so you want Spider-Man's help?

49:36.560 --> 49:38.270
He just wandered in.

49:41.190 --> 49:43.066
I didn't know where else to go.

49:44.568 --> 49:46.612
Someone's living in my house.

49:48.363 --> 49:50.199
Oscorp doesn't exist.

49:52.075 --> 49:53.160
My son...

49:57.247 --> 50:00.209
Sometimes I'm not myself.

50:01.627 --> 50:04.213
I'm... someone else.

50:04.296 --> 50:07.341
And every time he's in control,
I can't remember.

50:07.424 --> 50:09.718
-Who's in control?
-And now I'm here--

50:09.801 --> 50:12.971
-Who's in control?
-I don't know what's going on.

50:13.055 --> 50:16.642
-Okay, it's okay.
-And I don't-- Doesn't make sense.

50:17.726 --> 50:19.520
He's lost.

50:19.603 --> 50:23.148
And I don't mean just in the cosmos.
I mean, in his mind.

50:26.151 --> 50:27.319
Are they all like this?

50:28.278 --> 50:29.321
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

50:29.404 --> 50:32.783
They all have their own mental
or physical issues.

50:32.866 --> 50:35.786
Oh, well, he needs help
and maybe they all do.

50:36.703 --> 50:39.915
Wait, you don't mean--?
No, May, this isn't my problem.

50:39.998 --> 50:41.917
Peter, not your problem?

50:42.918 --> 50:46.421
May, their chance of getting help is
way better back where they came from.

50:47.548 --> 50:51.343
Sending them home, that's the best thing
that we can do for them.

50:51.426 --> 50:53.679
For them? Or for yourself?

50:56.765 --> 51:00.018
Look around you. This is what we do.

51:00.102 --> 51:03.939
-We help people.
-This is what's best for them.

51:04.898 --> 51:05.899
Trust me.

51:08.694 --> 51:12.406
<i>But the fact remains,
Spider-Man is a menace.</i>

51:13.323 --> 51:17.536
We'll be right back after a brief word
from <i>Daily Bugle </i>Supplements.

51:17.619 --> 51:20.414
The only other daily fix you need.

51:20.497 --> 51:21.540
And we're out.

51:24.543 --> 51:25.377
What?

51:28.630 --> 51:29.798
I got eyes on him.

51:29.882 --> 51:32.092
-<i>He's with his aunt and some guy.
</i>-You sure?

51:32.176 --> 51:35.137
-<i>They're just leaving the shelter.
</i>-Okay. Don't lose him.

51:45.898 --> 51:49.026
Thanks, May. Hope to see you again.

51:49.109 --> 51:53.030
Hey. He trusts you. So do I.

51:55.199 --> 51:56.450
Thanks for cleaning my suit.

51:57.659 --> 51:58.535
See you later.

52:01.079 --> 52:03.874
-Guys, this is Mr. Osborn.
-Hey, it's "doctor."

52:03.957 --> 52:06.210
Sorry. Dr. Osborn, these are my friends.

52:06.293 --> 52:07.628
This is Ned and MJ.

52:08.295 --> 52:11.965
-Mary Jane?
-It's Michelle Jones, actually.

52:13.550 --> 52:14.885
Fascinating.

52:19.139 --> 52:21.225
Do you think there are other Ned Leedses?

52:34.655 --> 52:35.948
Octavius?

52:40.035 --> 52:41.245
Osborn?

52:42.246 --> 52:43.497
What happened to you?

52:43.580 --> 52:44.706
What happened to--?

52:46.166 --> 52:48.919
-You're the walking corpse.
-What do you mean?

52:49.002 --> 52:51.547
You died, Norman.

52:51.630 --> 52:53.215
Years ago.

52:54.174 --> 52:55.759
You're insane.

52:55.843 --> 52:56.844
God, I love it here.

52:56.927 --> 53:00.264
What are you talking about?
He's standing right there.

53:00.347 --> 53:01.390
-He's not--
-Dead.

53:02.516 --> 53:05.227
They both died, fighting Spider-Man.

53:08.772 --> 53:11.108
It was all over the news.

53:11.191 --> 53:16.029
Green Goblin, impaled
by the glider you flew around on.

53:16.697 --> 53:20.742
And a couple of years later, you, Doc Ock,

53:20.826 --> 53:23.871
-drowned in the river with your machine.
-Nonsense.

53:24.705 --> 53:29.168
Spider-Man was trying to stop
my fusion reactor, so I stopped him.

53:29.918 --> 53:33.505
I had him by the throat, and then I...

53:38.510 --> 53:39.720
And then I was here.

53:40.470 --> 53:44.141
Please. Let me tell you something.
I was whupping Spider-Man's ass.

53:44.224 --> 53:46.768
He'll tell you.
And then he caused an overload.

53:46.852 --> 53:49.062
I was stuck in the grid, absorbing data.

53:49.146 --> 53:51.523
I was about to turn
into pure energy, and then...

53:51.607 --> 53:52.441
And then...

53:53.609 --> 53:55.652
And then-- Oh, shit.

53:57.029 --> 54:01.408
-I was about to die.
-Max, do you know? Do I die?

54:04.620 --> 54:06.955
-Oh, great. You caught another one.
-No, wait, Strange.

54:07.039 --> 54:08.707
He's not dangerous.

54:10.667 --> 54:11.668
It's okay.

54:14.838 --> 54:15.756
What is that?

54:16.340 --> 54:19.051
It's an ancient relic.
The Macchina di Kadavus.

54:19.134 --> 54:22.429
I've trapped your corrupted spell inside,
and once I finish the proper ritual,

54:22.513 --> 54:26.558
it'll reverse the spell and send
these guys back to their universes.

54:26.642 --> 54:29.144
And then what? We perish?

54:29.228 --> 54:30.938
No. No, thanks. I'll pass on that.

54:31.021 --> 54:34.024
Let me out of here. Peter!

54:34.608 --> 54:37.903
Strange, we can't send them back. Not yet.

54:38.654 --> 54:39.488
Why?

54:41.365 --> 54:44.743
-Well, some of these guys are gonna die.
-Parker.

54:45.452 --> 54:47.162
It's their fate.

54:48.247 --> 54:49.623
Come on, have a heart.

54:51.917 --> 54:54.503
In the grand calculus of the multiverse,

54:55.128 --> 54:58.924
their sacrifice means infinitely more
than their lives.

55:04.721 --> 55:05.806
I'm sorry, kid.

55:07.015 --> 55:09.351
If they die, they die.

55:23.323 --> 55:24.324
Peter!

55:37.963 --> 55:38.922
Don't.

55:41.800 --> 55:43.969
-What are you doing?
-Peter, you gotta go. Go.

55:44.052 --> 55:45.053
-Okay.
-Get out of here.

55:47.389 --> 55:49.141
This is why I never had kids.

56:03.614 --> 56:04.948
-Give me the box.
-No.

56:23.425 --> 56:24.801
Oh, my God, I'm dead.

56:24.885 --> 56:27.804
You're not dead, you've just been
separated from your physical form.

56:27.888 --> 56:29.848
My physical-- What?

56:30.766 --> 56:32.601
How are you doing that?

56:32.684 --> 56:36.271
-I have no idea.
-You should not be able to do that.

56:36.355 --> 56:37.814
This feels amazing.

56:48.867 --> 56:50.827
One of the coolest things
that's ever happened to me,

56:50.911 --> 56:52.371
but don't ever do that again.

56:59.044 --> 57:00.504
Hey! Get off of me!

57:49.136 --> 57:50.137
What is this place?

57:50.220 --> 57:53.056
The Mirror Dimension,
where I'm in control.

58:02.232 --> 58:04.735
Strange, stop.
Can we just talk about this?

58:04.818 --> 58:07.821
Parker, don't you realize
that in the multiverse,

58:07.905 --> 58:12.492
there are an infinite number of people
who know Peter Parker is Spider-Man?

58:12.576 --> 58:15.454
And if that spell gets loose,
they're all coming here.

58:15.537 --> 58:18.290
I know, I get it,
but we can't just send them home to die.

58:18.373 --> 58:19.583
It's their fate.

58:20.334 --> 58:23.253
You can't change that any more
than you could change who they are.

58:23.337 --> 58:26.548
What if we could?
What if we could change their fate?

58:28.592 --> 58:29.718
What are you doing?

58:34.848 --> 58:36.099
I'm not giving you the--

58:47.528 --> 58:48.779
Give me that back.

59:09.716 --> 59:11.969
Wait a minute.
Is that an Archimedean Spiral?

59:12.052 --> 59:14.471
The dimension is just geometry?
You're great at geometry.

59:14.555 --> 59:16.139
You can do geometry.

59:18.016 --> 59:19.935
Square the radius. Divide by pi.

59:20.018 --> 59:22.145
-Plot points along the curve.
-It's over, Parker.

59:23.105 --> 59:24.857
I'll come pick you up when it's done.

59:27.734 --> 59:28.777
Hey, Strange.

59:29.653 --> 59:31.196
You know what's cooler than magic?

59:35.284 --> 59:37.578
-Math.
-Don't do this.

59:41.206 --> 59:42.541
I'm sorry, sir, but...

59:47.171 --> 59:48.422
I have to try.

59:51.258 --> 59:54.094
-What happened?
-I had a fight with Strange and I won.

59:54.178 --> 59:56.180
-What?
-I stole his ring thing.

59:57.306 --> 1:00:01.059
I was swinging, and then I went
through this massive mirror thing,

1:00:01.143 --> 1:00:02.769
-and then I was back--
-Where is he?

1:00:02.853 --> 1:00:04.688
He's trapped,
but I'm not sure for how long.

1:00:04.771 --> 1:00:06.773
You could have left us to die.

1:00:06.857 --> 1:00:08.317
Why didn't you?

1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:09.860
'Cause that's not who he is.

1:00:13.238 --> 1:00:15.282
I think I can help you guys.

1:00:15.365 --> 1:00:18.076
If I can fix what happened to you,
then when you go back,

1:00:18.160 --> 1:00:21.580
things will be different,
and you might not die fighting Spider-Man.

1:00:21.663 --> 1:00:23.957
-What do you mean?
-Our technology is advanced--

1:00:24.041 --> 1:00:28.504
I can help you. You know,
I'm something of a scientist myself.

1:00:30.547 --> 1:00:32.382
Octavius knows what I can do.

1:00:32.466 --> 1:00:35.010
Fix? You mean, like a dog?

1:00:35.093 --> 1:00:36.428
I refuse.

1:00:36.512 --> 1:00:39.181
I can't promise you guys anything,
but at least this way,

1:00:39.264 --> 1:00:41.475
you get to go home and have a chance.

1:00:41.558 --> 1:00:42.726
A second chance.

1:00:43.393 --> 1:00:45.229
Isn't that worth trying?

1:00:45.312 --> 1:00:48.941
Trust me, Peter,
when you try to fix people,

1:00:49.024 --> 1:00:51.735
there are always consequences.

1:00:51.818 --> 1:00:55.030
You don't have to come.
I also didn't know that you could talk.

1:00:55.113 --> 1:00:56.573
But if you stay here...

1:00:57.616 --> 1:00:59.034
you'll have to deal with the wizard.

1:00:59.701 --> 1:01:03.622
So we go along or die.
Not much of a choice, is it?

1:01:03.705 --> 1:01:05.123
I just wanna go home.

1:01:05.207 --> 1:01:08.919
I, myself, don't wanna be killed,
especially by a guy dressed

1:01:09.002 --> 1:01:12.506
like Dungeons & Dragons,
so, what's your plan?

1:01:13.966 --> 1:01:15.634
I have it all under control.

1:01:19.179 --> 1:01:21.139
What are we gonna do about this thing?

1:01:21.890 --> 1:01:23.809
We need
to find somewhere safe for it, right?

1:01:23.892 --> 1:01:26.103
-Yeah, sure. You gotta take it.
-Wait, what?

1:01:26.186 --> 1:01:29.523
If something bad happens,
you just push this and then it's over.

1:01:29.606 --> 1:01:31.400
We're not gonna leave you.

1:01:31.483 --> 1:01:32.734
You can't. It's dangerous.

1:01:32.818 --> 1:01:34.820
-You have done enough.
-We're in this together.

1:01:34.903 --> 1:01:38.448
I know we're in this together, Ned,
but I can't do this if you're in danger.

1:01:38.532 --> 1:01:41.285
Okay? So for me, MJ,
please just take this.

1:01:44.246 --> 1:01:46.164
-Please.
-Fine.

1:01:46.832 --> 1:01:48.083
-Thank you.
-But, Peter,

1:01:48.166 --> 1:01:50.419
if I don't hear from you,
I'm pressing the button.

1:01:50.502 --> 1:01:52.713
-Sure.
-Okay. And I will do it.

1:01:54.173 --> 1:01:55.841
Yeah, we all believe you, Michelle.

1:01:55.924 --> 1:01:58.802
No way that's his girlfriend. No way.

1:01:58.886 --> 1:02:01.513
-She'll do it.
-Absolutely, she will.

1:02:02.931 --> 1:02:05.767
-Okay. See you later.
-Be safe.

1:02:05.851 --> 1:02:06.935
-You too.
-Okay.

1:02:11.273 --> 1:02:12.107
Okay.

1:02:14.401 --> 1:02:15.861
-Be careful, okay?
-Yeah. You too.

1:02:23.827 --> 1:02:24.661
So...

1:02:26.288 --> 1:02:27.581
who's coming with me?

1:02:31.877 --> 1:02:32.711
Well, I'm in.

1:02:33.420 --> 1:02:35.839
But if this goes sideways...

1:02:37.090 --> 1:02:39.092
I'm gonna fry you from the inside out.

1:02:51.563 --> 1:02:54.399
<i>-Where's Connors?
-He wants to stay in the truck.</i>

1:02:54.483 --> 1:02:57.277
<i>-Okay.
-Alarm system deactivated.</i>

1:02:58.403 --> 1:02:59.279
Hey, May.

1:03:00.280 --> 1:03:02.991
-Yeah?
-I feel bad using Happy's place like this.

1:03:03.075 --> 1:03:05.077
No, no, no. He'll get over it.

1:03:06.453 --> 1:03:08.956
<i>New Yorkers oppose
the Statue of Liberty renovation...</i>

1:03:09.039 --> 1:03:09.873
Oh, sorry.

1:03:10.999 --> 1:03:12.417
So this is your plan, Peter?

1:03:13.168 --> 1:03:14.503
No lab, no facilities?

1:03:14.586 --> 1:03:16.463
Just performing miracles in a condominium?

1:03:17.381 --> 1:03:20.592
What, you gonna cook us some cures
and some frozen burritos in a microwave?

1:03:20.676 --> 1:03:23.679
-I could go for a burrito.
-He's gonna kill us all.

1:03:23.762 --> 1:03:25.055
Well, let's hope not.

1:03:25.806 --> 1:03:27.933
-You're up first, Doc.
-What?

1:03:28.016 --> 1:03:29.601
Hey, I told you, I don't need fixing.

1:03:30.394 --> 1:03:32.437
I don't need fixing!

1:03:32.521 --> 1:03:36.859
Especially by a teenager using scraps
from a bachelor's junk drawer.

1:03:36.942 --> 1:03:39.528
Nah, nah, nah.
He got something back there.

1:03:40.070 --> 1:03:42.406
I can feel it. That weird energy.

1:03:43.907 --> 1:03:46.410
-What the hell is that?
-It's a fabricator.

1:03:47.035 --> 1:03:50.539
It can analyze, design,
construct basically anything.

1:03:51.540 --> 1:03:53.792
I thought that was
the tanning bed Happy broke.

1:03:56.670 --> 1:03:57.713
Look at that.

1:04:05.095 --> 1:04:06.555
He's gonna kill us all.

1:04:15.856 --> 1:04:17.191
What's going on there?

1:04:17.816 --> 1:04:20.986
So the chip in the back of Doc's neck
was designed to protect his brain

1:04:21.069 --> 1:04:24.740
from the AI system that's controlling
these tentacles, but if you look here...

1:04:27.159 --> 1:04:27.993
the chip is fried.

1:04:28.076 --> 1:04:30.329
So rather than him being
in control of the tentacles,

1:04:30.412 --> 1:04:32.497
the tentacles are now in control of him.

1:04:32.581 --> 1:04:37.669
Which, I guess, explains why
he is so miserable all the time.

1:04:46.053 --> 1:04:46.887
Thirsty?

1:04:50.182 --> 1:04:51.600
Well, yes, I am thirsty.

1:04:52.351 --> 1:04:53.810
Fresh water or salt?

1:04:54.811 --> 1:04:56.480
You know, because you're an octopus.

1:04:58.524 --> 1:04:59.691
What?

1:05:01.109 --> 1:05:02.486
Fresh water it is.

1:05:03.612 --> 1:05:04.780
Look at this place.

1:05:05.656 --> 1:05:08.867
-And all the possibilities.
-What, this condo?

1:05:08.951 --> 1:05:12.037
Yeah, yeah, the condo.
I love the whole open floor plan. No.

1:05:12.120 --> 1:05:14.331
Nah, man, I'm talking about the world.

1:05:15.916 --> 1:05:17.209
I kind of like who I am here.

1:05:19.086 --> 1:05:20.587
And all that power back there...

1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:23.382
I could be so much more.

1:05:24.633 --> 1:05:25.843
So why'd you come along?

1:05:25.926 --> 1:05:28.720
I have a daughter, and I want to see her.

1:05:28.804 --> 1:05:30.931
But he's not gonna send anyone home

1:05:31.014 --> 1:05:33.851
till he's finished
his little science project back there.

1:05:34.393 --> 1:05:35.644
You trust him?

1:05:35.727 --> 1:05:37.020
I don't trust anyone.

1:05:38.522 --> 1:05:40.607
How'd you end up like that, anyway?

1:05:42.025 --> 1:05:43.777
The place where I worked at,

1:05:43.861 --> 1:05:48.615
they were experimenting with electricity
created by living organisms, and then...

1:05:49.616 --> 1:05:51.827
I fell into a vat of electric eels.

1:05:51.910 --> 1:05:54.913
You're kidding.
I fell into a supercollider.

1:05:54.997 --> 1:05:55.831
Damn.

1:05:56.957 --> 1:05:58.625
Gotta be careful where you fall.

1:05:59.501 --> 1:06:00.836
Remarkable.

1:06:02.796 --> 1:06:04.715
The technology and you.

1:06:07.551 --> 1:06:08.886
When all this is over,

1:06:09.636 --> 1:06:14.141
if you need a job and you're willing
to commute to another universe...

1:06:20.731 --> 1:06:23.650
It worked. That totally worked!

1:06:23.734 --> 1:06:26.945
-I got it. I did it. Will you send him up?
-Here we go.

1:06:28.697 --> 1:06:30.157
-Sorry.
-Hold on, Doc.

1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:32.826
Oh, will these humiliations never cease?

1:06:32.910 --> 1:06:35.913
You, keep your science-fair project
away from me!

1:06:35.996 --> 1:06:37.623
It'll work. Have faith.

1:06:37.706 --> 1:06:40.709
Says the reckless fool
who turned himself into a monster.

1:06:41.919 --> 1:06:43.253
Please stop moving your head.

1:06:44.004 --> 1:06:46.423
-Hold still.
-Don't you dare.

1:06:52.012 --> 1:06:55.557
I swear, when I get out of this,
we're gonna rip you a new--

1:07:00.062 --> 1:07:01.063
Doc?

1:07:06.985 --> 1:07:07.819
Doc?

1:07:09.947 --> 1:07:10.781
Doc?

1:07:12.032 --> 1:07:12.991
Dr. Octav--

1:07:20.082 --> 1:07:21.250
It's so quiet.

1:07:25.170 --> 1:07:28.006
Those voices inside my head...

1:07:33.387 --> 1:07:34.680
I'd almost forgotten.

1:07:36.181 --> 1:07:37.015
Otto.

1:07:38.517 --> 1:07:40.269
Yes. Norman.

1:07:46.608 --> 1:07:47.818
It's me.

1:07:50.070 --> 1:07:51.405
Would you look at that?

1:08:12.009 --> 1:08:15.137
I'm grateful, dear boy. Truly.

1:08:15.220 --> 1:08:16.513
Yeah, you're welcome.

1:08:17.346 --> 1:08:18.348
How can I help?

1:08:19.140 --> 1:08:21.225
<i>This is Peter. Leave a message.</i>

1:08:22.603 --> 1:08:25.772
Yeah, Peter, this is Happy.
I accessed my doorbell camera.

1:08:25.856 --> 1:08:28.066
Who are those guys, huh? Is that a cyborg?

1:08:28.149 --> 1:08:30.527
You bring a cyborg
with robot legs into my house?

1:08:30.611 --> 1:08:33.113
Was one of the guys made of mud?
What's going on? Call me.

1:08:42.331 --> 1:08:43.540
How does it feel, Norman?

1:08:45.125 --> 1:08:46.667
You're about to become whole again.

1:08:48.170 --> 1:08:49.796
No more darker half.

1:08:50.796 --> 1:08:51.631
Just you.

1:08:52.883 --> 1:08:53.884
Just me.

1:09:03.310 --> 1:09:04.394
Okay.

1:09:05.979 --> 1:09:07.439
It just goes right here. This...

1:09:09.274 --> 1:09:10.776
That should be drawing power now.

1:09:10.859 --> 1:09:14.571
I'll come back in a second to check on it,
but keep an eye on the lights.

1:09:14.654 --> 1:09:17.573
When they're all green,
the electricity in your body's dissipated.

1:09:17.658 --> 1:09:21.411
Well, not all of the electricity. You need
electricity for your brain to function.

1:09:21.495 --> 1:09:22.871
Your nervous system is...

1:09:23.497 --> 1:09:26.041
I'm not really sure
why I'm explaining electricity to you.

1:09:26.667 --> 1:09:28.669
-Yeah, can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

1:09:28.752 --> 1:09:29.877
Are these your Legos?

1:09:32.506 --> 1:09:34.174
I gotta go. I'll be back.

1:09:40.055 --> 1:09:42.390
-Something feels off.
-What do you mean?

1:09:43.767 --> 1:09:46.060
-I don't like this.
-Leave it alone.

1:09:46.144 --> 1:09:50.107
The sooner you guys get through this,
the sooner we go home.

1:09:57.823 --> 1:10:00.117
-Well, where is he?
-He's inside.

1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:01.869
And yet here we are, outside.

1:10:01.952 --> 1:10:03.954
Did you not hear me say, "Don't lose him"?

1:10:04.037 --> 1:10:05.956
I want incriminating footage
of Spider-Man.

1:10:06.039 --> 1:10:08.000
I called Damage Control.
They're on their way.

1:10:08.083 --> 1:10:09.751
And so it begins.

1:10:09.835 --> 1:10:11.628
Place is about to be swarming with cops.

1:10:30.731 --> 1:10:31.565
-Peter?
-Peter?

1:10:33.483 --> 1:10:34.359
What's wrong?

1:10:35.736 --> 1:10:36.570
I don't know.

1:10:37.738 --> 1:10:38.572
May?

1:10:44.411 --> 1:10:45.495
What is it, Peter?

1:10:53.045 --> 1:10:54.171
What's happening?

1:11:01.261 --> 1:11:02.888
Why are you looking at me like that?

1:11:18.612 --> 1:11:23.367
That's some neat trick,
that sense of yours.

1:11:23.450 --> 1:11:26.954
-Norman?
-Norman's on sabbatical, honey.

1:11:27.704 --> 1:11:29.915
-The hell?
-The Goblin.

1:11:31.208 --> 1:11:35.921
"No more darker half"? Did you really
think that I'd let that happen?

1:11:36.839 --> 1:11:40.300
That I'd let you take away my power
just because you're blind

1:11:40.384 --> 1:11:43.762
-to what true power can bring you?
-You don't know me.

1:11:43.846 --> 1:11:45.055
Don't I?

1:11:48.308 --> 1:11:51.061
I saw how she trapped you,

1:11:51.144 --> 1:11:53.772
fighting her holy moral mission.

1:11:56.525 --> 1:11:58.694
We don't need you to save us.

1:11:58.777 --> 1:12:00.821
We don't need to be fixed.

1:12:04.366 --> 1:12:06.326
These are not curses.

1:12:08.161 --> 1:12:09.329
They're gifts.

1:12:10.706 --> 1:12:12.708
-Norman, no.
-Quiet, lapdog.

1:12:12.791 --> 1:12:15.377
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-I've watched you

1:12:15.460 --> 1:12:19.256
from deep behind Norman's cowardly eyes.

1:12:19.923 --> 1:12:25.262
Struggling to have everything you want

1:12:25.345 --> 1:12:28.891
while the world tries to make you choose.

1:12:31.059 --> 1:12:34.313
Gods don't have to choose.

1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:37.900
We take.

1:12:37.983 --> 1:12:39.443
May, run.

1:13:02.758 --> 1:13:03.884
Oh, my God.

1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:07.846
-What have you done?
-I liked you better before.

1:13:17.272 --> 1:13:20.400
Up here! He's up there.
It's the guy from the bridge.

1:13:43.215 --> 1:13:44.299
Did you see that?

1:14:10.868 --> 1:14:11.952
No, you don't!

1:14:21.378 --> 1:14:23.714
Strong enough to have it all.

1:14:27.092 --> 1:14:28.468
Too weak to take it!

1:15:04.087 --> 1:15:05.380
Now I got you.

1:15:07.549 --> 1:15:09.885
I told you, there'd be consequences!

1:15:28.111 --> 1:15:31.573
Your weakness, Peter, is morality.

1:15:32.115 --> 1:15:35.994
It's choking you. Can't you feel it?

1:15:44.378 --> 1:15:45.671
It didn't work.

1:15:47.089 --> 1:15:48.715
Norman was right.

1:15:48.799 --> 1:15:52.469
He got it from you,
that pathetic sickness.

1:15:57.182 --> 1:15:58.809
You tried to fix me.

1:15:59.685 --> 1:16:00.853
May, go.

1:16:00.936 --> 1:16:03.146
Now I'm gonna fix you.

1:16:07.192 --> 1:16:08.277
May, run, please.

1:16:12.281 --> 1:16:13.115
May!

1:16:19.580 --> 1:16:21.748
Peter, Peter, Peter.

1:16:21.832 --> 1:16:24.918
No good deed goes unpunished.

1:16:25.502 --> 1:16:27.671
You can thank me later.

1:16:33.552 --> 1:16:34.803
No!

1:17:04.708 --> 1:17:05.542
-May?
-Peter.

1:17:05.626 --> 1:17:06.919
May, May, I'm here.

1:17:10.964 --> 1:17:11.798
May.

1:17:12.466 --> 1:17:13.467
May, I'm here.

1:17:14.551 --> 1:17:16.845
Are you okay? What happened?

1:17:23.185 --> 1:17:25.187
It's okay. We're okay, right?

1:17:25.270 --> 1:17:26.980
Yeah. Knocked on my ass.

1:17:27.064 --> 1:17:28.190
-Yeah, me too.
-That's all.

1:17:30.651 --> 1:17:31.902
I think I broke my ribs.

1:17:37.282 --> 1:17:39.451
-This is all my fault, May.
-No.

1:17:39.535 --> 1:17:41.495
I should have let Strange send them back.

1:17:41.578 --> 1:17:42.704
You did the right thing.

1:17:43.580 --> 1:17:46.667
They would have been killed.
You did the right thing.

1:17:47.376 --> 1:17:49.419
It's not my responsibility, May.

1:17:53.173 --> 1:17:54.216
What Norman said?

1:17:55.634 --> 1:17:57.553
My moral mission? No.

1:17:57.636 --> 1:17:59.721
-No, May--
-Peter, you listen to me.

1:18:01.098 --> 1:18:02.099
You have a gift.

1:18:03.684 --> 1:18:05.060
You have power.

1:18:05.936 --> 1:18:07.354
And with great power,

1:18:07.437 --> 1:18:10.649
there must also come great responsibility.

1:18:16.154 --> 1:18:17.447
I know.

1:18:17.531 --> 1:18:19.449
Let's get the...out of here.

1:18:19.533 --> 1:18:20.659
Okay, let's go.

1:18:21.869 --> 1:18:23.537
Let me just catch my...

1:18:39.636 --> 1:18:41.638
-What happened? Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

1:18:41.722 --> 1:18:43.473
Yeah, you're okay. What happened?

1:18:45.309 --> 1:18:46.393
Just have to...

1:18:47.561 --> 1:18:48.520
catch my breath.

1:18:48.604 --> 1:18:50.522
Okay, well, catch your breath.
I'm right here.

1:18:50.606 --> 1:18:51.732
We're gonna take our time.

1:18:51.815 --> 1:18:54.818
You catch your breath
and then we'll take you to a doctor, okay?

1:19:13.295 --> 1:19:14.296
Are you okay?

1:19:15.380 --> 1:19:18.258
Somebody help!
I need an ambulance, please! Somebody?

1:19:18.342 --> 1:19:20.260
-What happened?
-Nothing happened.

1:19:21.345 --> 1:19:22.971
You're okay, you're okay.

1:19:24.723 --> 1:19:27.184
Let me just-- Let me catch my breath.

1:19:27.267 --> 1:19:29.144
I'm right here. I'm right here.

1:19:29.728 --> 1:19:30.729
I'm right here.

1:19:37.778 --> 1:19:38.779
You're okay.

1:19:40.447 --> 1:19:41.490
It's just me and you.

1:19:51.750 --> 1:19:52.584
May?

1:19:59.258 --> 1:20:00.092
May?

1:20:06.473 --> 1:20:07.891
Will you look at me, please?

1:20:16.692 --> 1:20:17.526
May.

1:20:18.694 --> 1:20:19.528
May.

1:20:21.530 --> 1:20:22.573
What are you doing, May?

1:20:22.656 --> 1:20:25.534
Please, will you just wake up
and talk to me? Please?

1:20:48.473 --> 1:20:50.184
Get out of the car now! Move!

1:20:56.732 --> 1:20:58.400
Get off, get off, get off me.

1:21:00.736 --> 1:21:01.570
Peter!

1:21:01.653 --> 1:21:03.447
-Run!
-It's just me and you, okay?

1:21:03.530 --> 1:21:05.407
It's just me and you, okay?

1:21:05.490 --> 1:21:07.242
Oh, May, I'm sorry.

1:21:07.326 --> 1:21:08.493
I'm so sorry.

1:21:08.577 --> 1:21:12.789
-I'm so, so, so sorry. I love you.
-Parker, come out with your hands up!

1:21:13.457 --> 1:21:15.918
Come out right now, or we will open fire!

1:21:16.001 --> 1:21:16.960
Run!

1:21:20.881 --> 1:21:23.217
All right, let's go, let's go! Move in!

1:21:41.193 --> 1:21:42.194
<i>Tragedy.</i>

1:21:46.114 --> 1:21:47.533
<i>What else can I call it?</i>

1:21:48.742 --> 1:21:50.661
<i>What more need be said?</i>

1:21:51.620 --> 1:21:54.164
<i>The damage, the destruction.</i>

1:21:54.957 --> 1:21:56.834
<i>You saw it with your own eyes.</i>

1:21:58.377 --> 1:22:03.298
<i>When will people wake up and realize
that everywhere Spider-Man goes,</i>

1:22:03.382 --> 1:22:06.218
<i>chaos and calamity ensue?</i>

1:22:07.052 --> 1:22:11.139
<i>Everything Spider-Man touches
comes to ruin.</i>

1:22:12.224 --> 1:22:14.226
<i>And we, the innocents,</i>

1:22:14.893 --> 1:22:16.854
<i>are left to pick up the pieces.</i>

1:22:19.356 --> 1:22:21.483
<i>J. Jonah Jameson reporting.</i>

1:22:21.567 --> 1:22:24.653
<i>Good night, and God help us all.</i>

1:22:44.256 --> 1:22:47.509
<i>We are told
that multiple people have been injured,</i>

1:22:47.593 --> 1:22:52.055
<i>and we can confirm
at least one person has been killed.</i>

1:22:52.139 --> 1:22:53.182
Still nothing?

1:22:54.850 --> 1:22:55.726
No.

1:23:11.825 --> 1:23:12.659
I'm gonna press it.

1:23:14.745 --> 1:23:17.372
-What? No, he--
-I know he told me to wait...

1:23:18.832 --> 1:23:21.001
-but I'm gonna do it.
-I just wish--

1:23:21.084 --> 1:23:22.794
I just wish we could see him.

1:23:28.091 --> 1:23:29.176
-Ned?
-Yeah?

1:23:30.219 --> 1:23:31.637
-Do that again.
-Yeah.

1:23:34.097 --> 1:23:35.349
I just wish we could see him.

1:23:39.269 --> 1:23:40.103
Okay.

1:23:40.854 --> 1:23:42.689
I just wish we could see Peter.

1:23:49.488 --> 1:23:51.406
<i>Lola, </i>you're right. I am magic.

1:23:52.699 --> 1:23:53.534
Is that him?

1:23:54.451 --> 1:23:56.828
-Yeah, yeah, it has to be.
-Peter. Peter!

1:23:56.912 --> 1:23:58.956
-Hey, Peter! Yeah.
-Peter!

1:24:07.422 --> 1:24:08.966
Hi. Hi.

1:24:09.049 --> 1:24:12.135
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay. I'm a nice guy.

1:24:14.805 --> 1:24:16.139
Okay.

1:24:18.725 --> 1:24:21.270
-Who the hell are you?
-I'm Peter Parker.

1:24:21.353 --> 1:24:25.524
-That's not possible.
-I am Spider-Man, in my world.

1:24:25.607 --> 1:24:28.694
But then yesterday, I was--

1:24:30.445 --> 1:24:32.239
I was just here.

1:24:36.702 --> 1:24:40.205
String theory, multidimensional reality...

1:24:41.498 --> 1:24:43.000
and matter displacement.

1:24:43.750 --> 1:24:44.585
All real?

1:24:44.668 --> 1:24:45.669
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:24:45.752 --> 1:24:46.962
I knew it.

1:24:48.672 --> 1:24:50.465
This has to be because of the spell.

1:24:51.091 --> 1:24:52.843
The spell? Like magic spell?

1:24:52.926 --> 1:24:54.761
-There's no spell. No.
-No spell.

1:24:54.845 --> 1:24:56.597
-Magic's real here too?
-I mean--

1:24:56.680 --> 1:24:58.515
-Shut up, Ned.
-No, it's not real.

1:24:58.599 --> 1:25:01.727
-Shut up. Stop talking.
-There's magicians, but there's no--

1:25:01.810 --> 1:25:03.478
Stop. Stop.

1:25:04.271 --> 1:25:05.606
-Prove it.
-Prove what?

1:25:05.689 --> 1:25:09.067
-That you're Peter Parker.
-I don't carry an ID with me, you know?

1:25:09.151 --> 1:25:11.570
Kind of defeats
the whole anonymous superhero thing.

1:25:14.364 --> 1:25:16.408
-Why'd you do that?
-To see if you have the tingle thing.

1:25:16.491 --> 1:25:18.452
I have the tingle thing,
just not for bread.

1:25:18.535 --> 1:25:20.537
Can you not throw the bread again?

1:25:20.621 --> 1:25:22.873
You're a deeply mistrusting person...

1:25:24.583 --> 1:25:25.626
and I respect it.

1:25:31.298 --> 1:25:32.132
Crawl around.

1:25:32.216 --> 1:25:34.134
-Crawl around?
-Yes.

1:25:34.218 --> 1:25:35.802
-No.
-Yes, crawl around.

1:25:35.886 --> 1:25:37.513
-Why do I need to?
-This is not enough.

1:25:37.596 --> 1:25:38.889
-This is plenty.
-No, it's not.

1:25:38.972 --> 1:25:40.641
-Yes, it is. It is.
-No, it's not. No.

1:25:40.724 --> 1:25:43.268
-How do I stick to the ceiling?
-Do it.

1:25:45.103 --> 1:25:45.979
Ned.

1:25:51.568 --> 1:25:54.988
My <i>lola's </i>asking if you could
just get the cobweb there.

1:25:55.072 --> 1:25:56.949
-Since you're, like, up there.
-Yeah.

1:26:04.957 --> 1:26:05.832
Thank you.

1:26:10.754 --> 1:26:11.588
We--

1:26:12.214 --> 1:26:13.048
We good?

1:26:13.131 --> 1:26:14.049
For now.

1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:17.719
So I opened the wrong portal
to the wrong Peter Parker.

1:26:17.803 --> 1:26:20.097
I guess you keep doing it
until we find the real one.

1:26:21.056 --> 1:26:22.099
No offense.

1:26:22.766 --> 1:26:24.268
-Okay.
-Okay. You got it.

1:26:26.645 --> 1:26:28.021
Find Peter Parker.

1:26:28.105 --> 1:26:30.148
What's the thing on his hand?

1:26:30.232 --> 1:26:32.234
Find Peter Parker.

1:26:34.236 --> 1:26:35.779
Find Peter Parker!

1:26:45.163 --> 1:26:46.623
Great, it's just some random guy.

1:26:47.499 --> 1:26:48.375
Hello.

1:26:49.334 --> 1:26:51.503
I hope it's okay,
I just came through this...

1:26:53.380 --> 1:26:54.381
It just closed.

1:26:55.924 --> 1:26:57.176
You're Peter?

1:26:57.968 --> 1:27:00.179
Yeah. Peter Parker.

1:27:02.306 --> 1:27:03.974
I've seen you two--

1:27:06.435 --> 1:27:07.269
Hi.

1:27:11.523 --> 1:27:14.151
Wait. He's-- He's not your friend.

1:27:30.083 --> 1:27:33.253
Wait. So you're Spider-Man too?
Why didn't you just say that?

1:27:33.337 --> 1:27:35.839
I generally don't go around
advertising it.

1:27:35.923 --> 1:27:38.008
Kind of defeats
the whole anonymous superhero thing.

1:27:38.091 --> 1:27:39.885
-I just said that.
-That's what he just said.

1:27:52.189 --> 1:27:55.734
My <i>lola's </i>asking if you could clean up
the webs you just shot.

1:27:55.817 --> 1:27:57.528
-Oh, sorry, <i>Lola.
</i>-Yes, of course.

1:27:57.611 --> 1:27:58.987
I'm going to bed.

1:27:59.071 --> 1:28:01.323
-Night, <i>Lola.
</i>-Good night, Ned's <i>lola.</i>

1:28:02.491 --> 1:28:04.284
This might seem kind of weird,

1:28:04.826 --> 1:28:07.454
but I've been trying to find
your friend ever since I got here.

1:28:09.039 --> 1:28:10.749
I just have this sense...

1:28:12.835 --> 1:28:14.169
that he needs my help.

1:28:14.253 --> 1:28:15.254
Our help.

1:28:17.214 --> 1:28:18.298
He does.

1:28:18.382 --> 1:28:20.092
We don't know where he is.

1:28:20.175 --> 1:28:24.179
And, honestly,
right now we're all he really has left.

1:28:25.681 --> 1:28:30.686
Well, is there someplace that he might go

1:28:30.769 --> 1:28:32.938
that has meaning to him?

1:28:34.439 --> 1:28:37.943
Like a place where he would go to just--?

1:28:38.026 --> 1:28:39.528
Get away from everything?

1:28:42.614 --> 1:28:45.868
For me, it was the top
of the Chrysler Building.

1:28:45.951 --> 1:28:47.202
Empire State.

1:28:47.286 --> 1:28:50.455
-It's just a-- It's a better view.
-That is a sweet view.

1:28:53.250 --> 1:28:54.126
Yes.

1:28:55.169 --> 1:28:58.130
Yeah. I think
I know exactly where that would be.

1:29:34.374 --> 1:29:35.209
I'm sorry.

1:29:42.925 --> 1:29:44.051
Peter, there's...

1:29:45.594 --> 1:29:47.095
There's some people here.

1:29:48.597 --> 1:29:49.431
What?

1:29:58.607 --> 1:29:59.942
Hey, wait, wait, whoa.

1:30:01.151 --> 1:30:02.069
What...?

1:30:05.113 --> 1:30:05.948
Sorry...

1:30:07.866 --> 1:30:08.825
about May.

1:30:12.538 --> 1:30:14.623
Yeah. Sorry.

1:30:16.750 --> 1:30:18.710
I got some understanding
of what it is you're--

1:30:18.794 --> 1:30:21.421
No, please don't tell me
that you know what I'm going through.

1:30:22.172 --> 1:30:23.924
-Okay.
-She's gone.

1:30:26.969 --> 1:30:28.303
And it's all my fault.

1:30:32.516 --> 1:30:33.809
She died for nothing.

1:30:37.729 --> 1:30:39.523
So I'll do what I should have done
in the first place.

1:30:40.148 --> 1:30:41.859
-Peter--
-Please don't.

1:30:42.985 --> 1:30:46.238
You don't belong here. Either of you.
So I'm sending you home.

1:30:47.823 --> 1:30:49.992
Those other guys are
from your worlds, right?

1:30:50.909 --> 1:30:52.411
So you deal with it.

1:30:52.494 --> 1:30:54.413
If they die, if you kill them...

1:30:55.372 --> 1:30:56.206
that's on you.

1:30:57.416 --> 1:30:58.292
It's not my problem.

1:30:59.251 --> 1:31:00.502
I don't care anymore.

1:31:01.920 --> 1:31:02.754
I'm done.

1:31:07.801 --> 1:31:10.012
I'm really sorry
that I dragged you into this.

1:31:13.724 --> 1:31:15.392
But you have to go home now.

1:31:17.936 --> 1:31:18.770
Good luck.

1:31:24.484 --> 1:31:26.028
My Uncle Ben was killed.

1:31:27.905 --> 1:31:28.947
It was my fault.

1:31:30.532 --> 1:31:31.408
I lost...

1:31:34.578 --> 1:31:36.121
I lost Gwen, my...

1:31:37.956 --> 1:31:38.957
She was my MJ.

1:31:41.835 --> 1:31:43.045
I couldn't save her.

1:31:44.713 --> 1:31:47.090
I'm never gonna be able
to forgive myself for that.

1:31:50.219 --> 1:31:51.929
But I carried on, tried to...

1:31:53.305 --> 1:31:55.557
Tried to keep going,
tried to keep being...

1:31:57.309 --> 1:31:59.186
the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man

1:31:59.269 --> 1:32:01.438
'cause I know that's
what she would've wanted.

1:32:02.272 --> 1:32:05.484
But at some point,
I just stopped pulling my punches.

1:32:09.530 --> 1:32:10.656
I got rageful.

1:32:13.158 --> 1:32:14.451
I got bitter.

1:32:15.869 --> 1:32:19.915
I just don't want you to end up like me.

1:32:21.708 --> 1:32:24.002
The night Ben died...

1:32:25.337 --> 1:32:27.464
I hunted down the man
who I thought did it.

1:32:29.341 --> 1:32:30.634
I wanted him dead.

1:32:33.512 --> 1:32:34.972
I got what I wanted.

1:32:37.432 --> 1:32:38.976
It didn't make it better.

1:32:42.980 --> 1:32:45.190
It took me a long time...

1:32:47.234 --> 1:32:48.861
to learn to get through that darkness.

1:32:52.239 --> 1:32:53.448
I wanna kill him.

1:32:56.285 --> 1:32:57.786
I wanna tear him apart.

1:33:01.832 --> 1:33:03.667
I can still hear her voice in my head.

1:33:09.214 --> 1:33:10.924
Even after she was hurt,

1:33:11.008 --> 1:33:13.093
she said to me
that we did the right thing.

1:33:22.519 --> 1:33:24.062
She told me that with great power...

1:33:26.231 --> 1:33:27.983
Comes great responsibility.

1:33:33.447 --> 1:33:34.865
Wait, what? How do you know that?

1:33:34.948 --> 1:33:36.491
Uncle Ben said it.

1:33:36.575 --> 1:33:38.035
The day he died.

1:33:42.748 --> 1:33:44.833
Maybe she didn't die for nothing, Peter.

1:33:54.927 --> 1:33:58.931
Okay, so Connors, Marko, Dillon and...

1:34:01.058 --> 1:34:03.519
I think that I can repair
the devices for Dillon and Marko,

1:34:03.602 --> 1:34:04.811
but the others...

1:34:05.479 --> 1:34:08.690
Oh, I got Connors.
I've cured him once, so no big deal.

1:34:10.359 --> 1:34:12.236
-What? It's no big deal.
-Great.

1:34:13.111 --> 1:34:14.238
Yeah, that's great.

1:34:16.990 --> 1:34:19.785
I think I can make an antiserum
for Dr. Osborn.

1:34:20.953 --> 1:34:22.579
Been thinking about it a long time.

1:34:25.874 --> 1:34:28.377
Gotta cure all of them. Right?

1:34:30.003 --> 1:34:30.838
Right.

1:34:32.589 --> 1:34:33.799
That's what we do.

1:34:42.266 --> 1:34:43.141
What?

1:34:43.809 --> 1:34:45.185
Just three yous.

1:35:03.412 --> 1:35:06.456
So... do you have a best friend too?

1:35:08.876 --> 1:35:09.710
I did.

1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:12.880
You did?

1:35:14.756 --> 1:35:16.175
He died in my arms...

1:35:18.135 --> 1:35:19.678
after he tried to kill me.

1:35:21.722 --> 1:35:23.140
It was heartbreaking.

1:35:25.392 --> 1:35:26.476
Dude.

1:35:33.442 --> 1:35:35.903
-Hey.
-Will you run a diagnostic?

1:35:35.986 --> 1:35:36.820
Yeah.

1:35:46.455 --> 1:35:47.456
Hey, you okay?

1:35:49.041 --> 1:35:50.751
Yeah, I'm fine. Are you okay?

1:35:54.755 --> 1:35:56.215
You don't deserve this.

1:35:57.674 --> 1:36:00.802
-I've ruined your life. I ruined it.
-No. No, no, no.

1:36:01.595 --> 1:36:03.430
Look at me. I'm here.

1:36:05.057 --> 1:36:06.225
Not going anywhere.

1:36:08.143 --> 1:36:11.146
We'll get through this
and we'll get through it together.

1:36:12.189 --> 1:36:13.023
Okay?

1:36:14.441 --> 1:36:16.401
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:36:21.490 --> 1:36:22.407
Thank you.

1:36:33.919 --> 1:36:35.337
You have someone?

1:36:36.171 --> 1:36:37.005
No.

1:36:38.465 --> 1:36:42.386
I got no time
for Peter Parker stuff, you know?

1:36:44.471 --> 1:36:45.639
Do you?

1:36:47.099 --> 1:36:49.101
That's a little complicated.

1:36:50.102 --> 1:36:51.311
I understand.

1:36:51.395 --> 1:36:53.772
I guess it's just not
in the cards for guys like us.

1:36:53.856 --> 1:36:56.525
Well, I wouldn't give up.

1:36:56.608 --> 1:36:59.528
Took a while, but we made it work.

1:36:59.611 --> 1:37:01.238
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:37:01.321 --> 1:37:04.032
Me and... MJ.

1:37:05.492 --> 1:37:06.785
My MJ.

1:37:08.537 --> 1:37:10.080
It gets confusing here.

1:37:11.456 --> 1:37:12.291
Yeah.

1:37:12.374 --> 1:37:14.376
-Peter!
-Yeah?

1:37:14.459 --> 1:37:17.880
-Oh, sorry, did you mean...?
-"Peter" Peter.

1:37:17.963 --> 1:37:19.798
-We're all called Peter.
-We're all Peter.

1:37:19.882 --> 1:37:22.926
-Peter Parker?
-Same again. We're all Peter Parker.

1:37:23.010 --> 1:37:24.136
The computer.

1:37:25.888 --> 1:37:27.347
-Oh, I'm ready.
-Yeah. Me too.

1:37:27.431 --> 1:37:32.436
Okay, so now, all we gotta do is lure
these guys someplace, right?

1:37:32.519 --> 1:37:36.023
Try to cure them
while they try to kill us,

1:37:36.106 --> 1:37:37.649
and then send them home.

1:37:37.733 --> 1:37:40.360
-Using a magic box.
-Well, that's the plan.

1:37:40.444 --> 1:37:42.946
Are you gonna go into battle
dressed as a cool youth pastor,

1:37:43.030 --> 1:37:44.615
or do you got your suit?

1:37:46.658 --> 1:37:47.492
Good.

1:37:47.576 --> 1:37:50.037
-Here's your web cartridges.
-Thanks, man.

1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:51.330
What's that for?

1:37:51.413 --> 1:37:54.249
It's my web fluid.
It's for my web shooters. Why?

1:37:57.586 --> 1:37:59.421
-That came out of you.
-Yeah.

1:37:59.505 --> 1:38:01.173
-You can't do that, huh?
-No.

1:38:01.256 --> 1:38:03.008
How on earth does that even--?

1:38:03.091 --> 1:38:05.844
We're getting sidetracked.
This is where we'll do this, okay?

1:38:05.928 --> 1:38:07.679
It's isolated, so no one should get hurt.

1:38:08.430 --> 1:38:10.849
We draw them there with the box.
It's the one thing they all want.

1:38:10.933 --> 1:38:13.060
All we have to do is figure out
how to get there.

1:38:13.143 --> 1:38:14.561
-We could portal there.
-What?

1:38:14.645 --> 1:38:17.064
-I'm magic now.
-Yeah, he's right. He can.

1:38:17.147 --> 1:38:18.815
-Yeah, we saw.
-Yeah, he is.

1:38:19.316 --> 1:38:21.193
-Wait, really?
-I got Doctor Strange magic.

1:38:21.276 --> 1:38:22.486
-No way.
-Yeah.

1:38:23.237 --> 1:38:26.573
I promise you, I won't turn
into a supervillain and try to kill you.

1:38:28.951 --> 1:38:30.035
Okay.

1:38:30.994 --> 1:38:32.246
Thank you.

1:38:38.210 --> 1:38:40.963
Here goes nothing.
What's that thing you always say?

1:38:41.672 --> 1:38:44.049
-Expect disappointment and--
-No, no, no.

1:38:45.425 --> 1:38:47.094
We're gonna kick some ass.

1:38:47.177 --> 1:38:48.178
Okay.

1:38:48.887 --> 1:38:51.348
Cure. Cure some ass.

1:38:51.431 --> 1:38:53.267
Cure that ass.

1:38:55.727 --> 1:38:56.979
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1:38:57.062 --> 1:38:58.939
<i>the </i>Bugle<i> tip line has
just received a call</i>

1:38:59.022 --> 1:39:02.276
<i>from none other

1:39:02.359 --> 1:39:04.820
<i>fresh from his rampage in Queens.</i>

1:39:05.571 --> 1:39:09.700
<i>So, Peter Parker, what pernicious
propaganda are you peddling?</i>

1:39:09.783 --> 1:39:11.451
<i>-Just the truth.
-Oh, sure.</i>

1:39:11.535 --> 1:39:12.703
<i>Truth is...</i>

1:39:14.246 --> 1:39:15.581
<i>that this is all my fault.</i>

1:39:16.540 --> 1:39:19.084
<i>I accidentally brought

1:39:19.168 --> 1:39:20.836
Well, he admits it.

1:39:20.919 --> 1:39:22.462
<i>And if those people are watching...</i>

1:39:24.506 --> 1:39:26.383

1:39:27.759 --> 1:39:29.303

-<i>That's why I'm here.
</i>-Where is "here," exactly?

1:39:42.941 --> 1:39:44.985
A place that represents second chances.

1:39:47.905 --> 1:39:50.657
<i>The Statue of Liberty? Good God, folks.</i>

1:39:50.741 --> 1:39:53.994
<i>He's about to destroy
another national landmark.</i>

1:39:54.077 --> 1:39:55.746
World, if you're watching...

1:39:55.829 --> 1:39:57.414
<i>Believe me, the world is watching.</i>

1:39:58.457 --> 1:39:59.583
...wish me luck.

1:40:01.543 --> 1:40:03.754
Your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man could use some.

1:40:10.302 --> 1:40:12.387
Okay, it could be any minute now.

1:40:12.471 --> 1:40:14.681
Yep, almost done.

1:40:19.603 --> 1:40:24.191
You know, Max was,
like, the sweetest guy ever

1:40:24.816 --> 1:40:26.151
before he fell into...

1:40:27.069 --> 1:40:29.696
-a pool of electric eels.
-That'll do it.

1:40:32.491 --> 1:40:33.825
Oh, there it goes.

1:40:35.953 --> 1:40:37.120
You okay?

1:40:37.204 --> 1:40:39.039
Oh, it's my back.

1:40:39.122 --> 1:40:42.417
It's kind of stiff
from all the swinging, I guess.

1:40:42.501 --> 1:40:44.670
-Yeah. No, I got a middle back thing too.
-Really?

1:40:44.753 --> 1:40:46.880
Yeah. You want me to crack it?

1:40:48.173 --> 1:40:49.424
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1:40:49.508 --> 1:40:50.926
-That'd be great.
-All right.

1:40:52.511 --> 1:40:53.595
-You ready?
-Yeah.

1:40:56.974 --> 1:40:58.517
Yep. That's good.

1:40:59.309 --> 1:41:00.143
How is it?

1:41:02.729 --> 1:41:05.148
-That's good. That's better.
-Right? Yeah.

1:41:09.403 --> 1:41:12.239
This is so cool. I always wanted brothers.

1:41:13.866 --> 1:41:16.910
So you, like,
make your own web fluid in your body?

1:41:16.994 --> 1:41:18.704
I'd rather not talk about this.

1:41:18.787 --> 1:41:20.747
-I don't mean to--
-But are you teasing me?

1:41:20.831 --> 1:41:24.668
No, no, no. He's not teasing you.
It's just that we can't do that,

1:41:24.751 --> 1:41:28.255
so we're curious as to how
your web situation works, that's all.

1:41:28.338 --> 1:41:31.049
If it's personal, I don't wanna pry,
but I think it's cool.

1:41:31.133 --> 1:41:34.219
I-- I wish I could tell you,
but it's, like, I don't do it.

1:41:34.303 --> 1:41:36.597
Like I don't do breathing.

1:41:36.680 --> 1:41:38.640
Like, breathing just happens.

1:41:38.724 --> 1:41:43.061
Does it just come out of your wrists,
or does it come out of anywhere else?

1:41:43.145 --> 1:41:45.355
Only-- Only the wrists.

1:41:45.439 --> 1:41:47.649
Never had a web block?
I run out of webs all the time.

1:41:47.733 --> 1:41:50.235
-I have to make my own in a lab.
-Right. That's--

1:41:50.319 --> 1:41:53.280
-It's a hassle compared to what you got.
-Sounds like a hassle.

1:41:53.363 --> 1:41:56.825
But I did. You said that,
I was like, "I had a web block."

1:41:57.451 --> 1:41:59.912
-Why?
-Existential crisis stuff.

1:41:59.995 --> 1:42:02.414
-Yeah. Don't get me started on that.
-Hey.

1:42:02.956 --> 1:42:06.043
What are some of the craziest villains
that you guys have fought?

1:42:06.126 --> 1:42:08.837
-Seems you've met some of them.
-That's a good question.

1:42:08.921 --> 1:42:14.259
Yeah, I fought an alien
made out of black goo once.

1:42:14.343 --> 1:42:16.428
Oh, no way. I fought an alien too.

1:42:16.512 --> 1:42:18.222
On Earth and in space.

1:42:18.305 --> 1:42:20.098
-He was purple.
-I wanna fight an alien.

1:42:20.182 --> 1:42:23.936
I'm still, like, that you fought
an alien in space.

1:42:24.853 --> 1:42:29.066
I'm lame compared-- I fought
a Russian guy in a rhinoceros machine.

1:42:29.149 --> 1:42:31.860
Can we rewind it back
to the "I'm lame" part?

1:42:31.944 --> 1:42:33.153
'Cause you are not.

1:42:33.237 --> 1:42:35.322
Thanks. I appreciate that.
I'm not saying I am--

1:42:35.405 --> 1:42:37.366
But it's just the self-talk.
Maybe we should...

1:42:37.449 --> 1:42:40.202
-Listen, I--
-'Cause you're amazing.

1:42:40.285 --> 1:42:42.204
Just to take it in for a minute.

1:42:42.287 --> 1:42:44.790
-Yeah, I can take it in.
-You are amazing.

1:42:44.873 --> 1:42:46.583
-I can. Thank you.
-You are amazing.

1:42:46.667 --> 1:42:49.711
-Will you say it?
-I needed to hear that. Thank you.

1:42:50.212 --> 1:42:52.631
All right, guys, focus up. You feel that?

1:42:52.714 --> 1:42:53.549
Yeah.

1:43:01.139 --> 1:43:02.224
What's up, Peter?

1:43:05.310 --> 1:43:06.812
How you like the new-new?

1:43:07.980 --> 1:43:11.859
Look, you give it to me,
I'm gonna destroy it.

1:43:13.026 --> 1:43:14.486
But I'll let you live.

1:43:15.153 --> 1:43:16.697
Don't make me a murderer, Peter.

1:43:19.575 --> 1:43:20.951
Okay, guys, here he comes.

1:43:27.916 --> 1:43:30.210
Hey, Max! I missed you, man.

1:43:33.505 --> 1:43:35.048
All right, MJ, heads up!

1:43:36.091 --> 1:43:37.259
Got it. Close it.

1:43:41.305 --> 1:43:43.390
-Ned, it's not closing.
-Yeah, I know.

1:43:43.473 --> 1:43:45.058
-Why isn't it closing?
-I don't know.

1:43:45.142 --> 1:43:48.187
-Did you close it before? No?
-I mean, I've opened some.

1:43:57.112 --> 1:43:59.531
Max, Max, Max. Can we talk for a second?

1:43:59.615 --> 1:44:01.700
-Just you and me, just talk?
-Look who showed up.

1:44:02.409 --> 1:44:03.702
My old friend Spider-Man.

1:44:03.785 --> 1:44:05.746
I'm trying to save you.
That's all I've wanted.

1:44:05.829 --> 1:44:07.414
-You're not trying to save me.
-I am.

1:44:07.497 --> 1:44:09.291
You ain't even the shit no more.

1:44:10.125 --> 1:44:12.711
Don't worry about me. I'll save myself.

1:44:13.420 --> 1:44:14.546
Burn up!

1:44:16.215 --> 1:44:17.841
Well, I got his attention. Now what?

1:44:17.925 --> 1:44:19.426
Okay, great.

1:44:20.385 --> 1:44:23.180
Just FYI, lizard guy's here too.

1:44:24.890 --> 1:44:26.308
Guys, comm check. Hello?

1:44:27.518 --> 1:44:30.103
-<i>I need Max's cure!
</i>-Yeah. I'm on it.

1:44:31.063 --> 1:44:32.481
<i>Peter, I need the Lizard cure.</i>

1:44:33.398 --> 1:44:34.441
Okay, okay.

1:44:39.780 --> 1:44:41.490
Where's the box, Peter?

1:44:41.573 --> 1:44:44.368
-Flint, we could help everyone.
-I don't care.

1:44:55.754 --> 1:44:56.630
Sorry!

1:44:58.215 --> 1:44:59.299
Gross!

1:44:59.383 --> 1:45:02.052
Sad to tell you, Sandman,
nobody's going home.

1:45:40.465 --> 1:45:42.801
What the hell is going on out there?

1:45:42.885 --> 1:45:44.636
I keep yelling at you, Peter 2!

1:45:44.720 --> 1:45:47.848
-But I thought you were Peter 2.
-What? I'm not Peter 2.

1:45:47.931 --> 1:45:50.184
Stop arguing, both of you!
Listen to Peter 1.

1:45:50.267 --> 1:45:53.187
-We're clearly not very good at this.
-I know, I know. We suck.

1:45:53.270 --> 1:45:56.106
-I don't know how to work as a team.
-Me neither.

1:45:56.190 --> 1:45:58.150
I do. I've been in a team, okay?

1:45:58.233 --> 1:46:00.861
I don't wanna brag, but I will.
I was in the Avengers.

1:46:00.944 --> 1:46:02.279
-The Avengers?
-Yeah.

1:46:02.362 --> 1:46:03.572
-That's great.
-Thank you.

1:46:03.655 --> 1:46:04.531
What is that?

1:46:05.699 --> 1:46:06.909
You don't have the Avengers?

1:46:06.992 --> 1:46:08.493
Is that a band? Are you in a band?

1:46:08.577 --> 1:46:11.955
No, I'm not in a band.
The Avengers is Earth's mightiest--

1:46:12.039 --> 1:46:13.790
-How's this helping?
-It's not important.

1:46:13.874 --> 1:46:15.709
All we gotta do is focus,
trust your tingle,

1:46:15.792 --> 1:46:17.211
and coordinate our attacks.

1:46:17.294 --> 1:46:20.005
Yes. Okay. Let's pick one target.

1:46:20.088 --> 1:46:22.466
-Right.
-We take them off the board one at a time.

1:46:22.549 --> 1:46:25.135
-You got it. Okay, Peter 1, Peter 2.
-Peter 2.

1:46:25.219 --> 1:46:26.512
-Peter 3.
-Peter 3.

1:46:26.595 --> 1:46:28.514
-Let's do this. Ready?
-Wait, wait, wait!

1:46:29.473 --> 1:46:30.682
I love you guys.

1:46:33.352 --> 1:46:34.478
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:46:36.104 --> 1:46:37.648
-All right, let's do this.
-Let's go.

1:47:07.594 --> 1:47:08.679
Okay, Spider-Mans.

1:47:09.638 --> 1:47:11.098
Sandman's first.

1:47:12.266 --> 1:47:15.102
-I'm gonna lead him inside the statue.
-I'll meet you at the top.

1:47:18.063 --> 1:47:19.439
-Come on!
-Hey!

1:47:22.860 --> 1:47:25.737
-Hey, Dr. Connors.
-Hello, Peter.

1:47:27.030 --> 1:47:28.240
Peter 1!

1:47:28.323 --> 1:47:29.199
I got it!

1:47:40.919 --> 1:47:43.380
Flint, we're trying to help you!

1:47:45.465 --> 1:47:47.134
Guys, I'm at the top!

1:47:47.217 --> 1:47:48.343
I need the cure!

1:47:50.888 --> 1:47:52.431
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1:47:54.391 --> 1:47:58.228
Just wait your turn, doc!

1:47:58.312 --> 1:47:59.438
I'll be right back.

1:48:36.683 --> 1:48:37.893
It's okay, Flint.

1:48:40.145 --> 1:48:41.772
We're gonna get you home.

1:48:42.564 --> 1:48:44.483
You just stay right here.

1:48:49.655 --> 1:48:51.949
How do we stop him?
I've never seen him this powerful.

1:48:52.032 --> 1:48:54.117
It's the arc reactor.
We gotta get it off him.

1:48:54.201 --> 1:48:55.536
You're not gonna take this from me.

1:48:58.705 --> 1:48:59.665
That's not gonna work.

1:49:04.920 --> 1:49:06.547
We gotta do this up close.

1:49:06.630 --> 1:49:09.466
Peter 2, go right.
Peter 3, go left. On me.

1:49:14.513 --> 1:49:15.347
Yeah!

1:49:36.994 --> 1:49:40.163
I'm trying to close it.
I can't help that it's not working.

1:49:40.247 --> 1:49:43.083
It's fine. You'll do it again.
We'll keep trying.

1:49:43.166 --> 1:49:46.295
-All right, we got this.
-Focus and close the portal.

1:49:49.631 --> 1:49:51.383
Oh, no. No, no, no.

1:49:51.466 --> 1:49:54.011
And that is a lizard and we should go!

1:49:58.599 --> 1:49:59.433
Run!

1:50:00.434 --> 1:50:02.895
Come on! Come on, this way!
Quick, quick, quick!

1:50:02.978 --> 1:50:04.229
Connors, stop!

1:50:13.614 --> 1:50:14.740
Yeah.

1:50:27.211 --> 1:50:29.755
Leave them. They're mine.

1:50:29.838 --> 1:50:32.424
I don't need your help.
I got it just fine.

1:50:32.508 --> 1:50:34.676
Dr. Octavius, no.

1:50:37.262 --> 1:50:38.639
What are you doing?

1:50:40.307 --> 1:50:41.517
Get it off of me.

1:50:52.486 --> 1:50:53.612
There you go.

1:51:12.840 --> 1:51:13.715
MJ!

1:51:26.103 --> 1:51:27.855
-We gotta hide this thing.
-Oh, right.

1:51:32.109 --> 1:51:33.735
-Nice, Ned!
-Yeah!

1:51:37.406 --> 1:51:38.323
Where is he?

1:51:38.407 --> 1:51:39.950
-No!
-Wait, wait, wait.

1:51:40.033 --> 1:51:44.079
Before you do anything, Mister--
Doctor Strange, Peter's plan is working.

1:51:44.162 --> 1:51:45.914
-What plan?
-He's curing them.

1:51:54.965 --> 1:51:56.091
Dr. Connors?

1:51:59.511 --> 1:52:00.596
Welcome back, sir.

1:52:02.681 --> 1:52:03.932
Well, I'll be damned.

1:52:06.894 --> 1:52:08.520
Did you just open a portal?

1:52:09.521 --> 1:52:10.689
Yes, sir, I did.

1:52:18.447 --> 1:52:19.489
Max?

1:52:20.657 --> 1:52:22.201
Max?

1:52:22.284 --> 1:52:25.412
-Don't worry. I'm all tapped out.
-Are you sure about that?

1:52:27.372 --> 1:52:28.665
Back to being a nobody.

1:52:28.749 --> 1:52:32.044
-You were never a nobody, Max.
-Yes, I was.

1:52:32.669 --> 1:52:33.754
You didn't see me.

1:52:35.297 --> 1:52:37.966
-Can I tell you something though?
-Yeah.

1:52:39.009 --> 1:52:40.761
You got a nice face. You're just a kid.

1:52:42.262 --> 1:52:43.430
You're from Queens.

1:52:44.556 --> 1:52:47.809
You got that suit.
You help a lot of poor people.

1:52:47.893 --> 1:52:49.728
I just thought you was gonna be Black.

1:52:50.938 --> 1:52:53.315
-Oh, man, I'm sorry.
-Don't apologize.

1:52:53.398 --> 1:52:55.817
There's gotta be a Black Spider-Man
somewhere out there.

1:52:59.279 --> 1:53:00.489
Goddamn eels.

1:53:04.243 --> 1:53:05.661
The power of the sun.

1:53:08.914 --> 1:53:10.415
In the palm of your hand.

1:53:10.499 --> 1:53:11.708
Peter?

1:53:14.294 --> 1:53:15.128
Otto.

1:53:17.089 --> 1:53:18.799
Oh, it's good to see you, dear boy.

1:53:19.716 --> 1:53:21.093
It's good to see you.

1:53:21.885 --> 1:53:23.095
You're all grown up.

1:53:24.847 --> 1:53:25.889
How are you?

1:53:28.183 --> 1:53:29.226
Trying to do better.

1:53:36.650 --> 1:53:38.527
-Strange, wait, we're so close.
-Skip it!

1:53:38.610 --> 1:53:41.405
I've been dangling
over the Grand Canyon for 12 hours.

1:53:41.488 --> 1:53:43.156
I know, I know, I know. I--

1:53:45.409 --> 1:53:47.244
I'm sorry about that, sir. I mean...

1:53:47.327 --> 1:53:50.330
-You went to the Grand Canyon?
-He could have used your help.

1:53:50.414 --> 1:53:52.583
It's okay. These are my new friends.

1:53:52.666 --> 1:53:55.127
This is Peter Parker, Peter Parker.
Spider-Man, Spider-Man.

1:53:55.210 --> 1:53:56.795
They're mes from other universes.

1:53:56.879 --> 1:53:59.631
They're here to help.
This is the wizard I told you about.

1:53:59.715 --> 1:54:03.051
I am really impressed that you've managed
to give them all a second chance, kid.

1:54:04.261 --> 1:54:06.388
But this has to end. Now.

1:54:06.471 --> 1:54:09.850
Can the Spider-Man come out to play?

1:54:31.788 --> 1:54:32.998
Strange, no!

1:55:02.277 --> 1:55:03.487
Are you okay?

1:55:04.571 --> 1:55:05.447
Yeah.

1:55:05.531 --> 1:55:06.698
I'm okay.

1:55:09.701 --> 1:55:10.827
Are you okay?

1:56:28.363 --> 1:56:29.865
Thank you, Mr. Cape, sir.

1:56:33.202 --> 1:56:34.036
Ned?

1:56:35.454 --> 1:56:36.496
-Ned!
-Hey!

1:56:41.126 --> 1:56:42.044
MJ!

1:56:42.127 --> 1:56:43.295
Peter?

1:56:43.378 --> 1:56:45.214
-Ned!
-Peter!

1:56:46.089 --> 1:56:47.257
Hey!

1:56:47.341 --> 1:56:49.384
-Are you okay?
-We're okay!

1:57:03.524 --> 1:57:04.775
Poor Peter.

1:57:05.526 --> 1:57:09.029
Too weak to send me home to die.

1:57:09.780 --> 1:57:10.614
No.

1:57:11.490 --> 1:57:13.200
I just wanna kill you myself.

1:57:14.034 --> 1:57:14.868
Attaboy.

1:59:05.229 --> 1:59:06.563
She was there...

1:59:07.564 --> 1:59:09.566
because of you.

1:59:09.650 --> 1:59:11.902
I may have struck the blow,

1:59:12.819 --> 1:59:14.238
but you...

1:59:17.658 --> 1:59:20.869
You are the one that killed her.

1:59:47.813 --> 1:59:48.647
Peter.

2:00:02.286 --> 2:00:03.495
What have I done?

2:00:07.583 --> 2:00:09.293
-It's you.
-You okay?

2:00:10.794 --> 2:00:12.629
Yeah, I'm good. I've been stabbed before.

2:00:12.713 --> 2:00:14.339
-Oh, good, good, good.
-Hey.

2:00:14.423 --> 2:00:16.800
-Oh, man.
-Hey, nice catch.

2:00:17.926 --> 2:00:18.802
Nice throw.

2:00:21.430 --> 2:00:25.809
-What? Is that happening, or am I dying?
-Yeah, no, that's happening. That's real.

2:00:25.893 --> 2:00:27.644
Are there people in the sky?

2:00:36.361 --> 2:00:38.614
-I gotta go.
-Yeah. I got it. You okay?

2:00:43.118 --> 2:00:44.411
What's happening?

2:00:44.494 --> 2:00:46.705
They're starting to come through.
I can't stop them.

2:00:46.788 --> 2:00:49.833
There's gotta be something we could do.
Can't you just cast the spell again?

2:00:49.917 --> 2:00:53.504
-The original way, before I screwed it up.
-We're too late for that. They're here.

2:00:54.588 --> 2:00:56.632
They're here because of you.

2:01:02.095 --> 2:01:03.597
What if everyone forgot who I was?

2:01:03.680 --> 2:01:06.350
-What?
-They're coming here because of me, right?

2:01:06.433 --> 2:01:07.976
Because I'm Peter Parker?

2:01:08.519 --> 2:01:09.728
So cast a new spell.

2:01:09.811 --> 2:01:12.231
But this time, make everyone forget
who Peter Parker is.

2:01:12.314 --> 2:01:13.690
Make everyone forget...

2:01:15.651 --> 2:01:17.069
-me.
-No.

2:01:17.152 --> 2:01:19.947
-But it would work, right?
-Yeah, it would work.

2:01:21.365 --> 2:01:23.951
But you gotta understand
that would mean that everyone

2:01:24.034 --> 2:01:26.578
who knows and loves you, we...

2:01:28.747 --> 2:01:30.624
We'd have no memory of you.

2:01:32.417 --> 2:01:34.253
It would be as though you never existed.

2:01:37.631 --> 2:01:38.465
I know.

2:01:40.509 --> 2:01:41.802
Do it.

2:01:45.430 --> 2:01:48.100
You better go and say your goodbyes.
You don't have long.

2:01:48.725 --> 2:01:50.769
-Thank you, sir.
-Call me Stephen.

2:01:54.439 --> 2:01:55.315
Thank you, Stephen.

2:01:57.359 --> 2:02:00.153
Yeah. Still feels weird.

2:02:02.823 --> 2:02:04.116
I'll see you around.

2:02:05.951 --> 2:02:06.994
So long, kid.

2:02:15.002 --> 2:02:15.836
Hey.

2:02:16.962 --> 2:02:19.506
I think this is it.
I think you're about to go home.

2:02:19.590 --> 2:02:21.091
-Okay.
-All right.

2:02:21.175 --> 2:02:22.176
Look, I...

2:02:24.595 --> 2:02:25.596
Thank you.

2:02:26.513 --> 2:02:29.641
I just wanna-- I want you to--
I wanna tell you that--

2:02:30.350 --> 2:02:32.311
I don't know how to say this. I--

2:02:32.394 --> 2:02:34.062
-Peter.
-I want you to know that I...

2:02:35.772 --> 2:02:38.275
You know. It's what we do.

2:02:40.152 --> 2:02:41.486
Yeah, it's what we do.

2:02:43.071 --> 2:02:45.490
Right, I gotta find Ned and MJ. I--

2:02:47.034 --> 2:02:49.036
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2:02:53.415 --> 2:02:55.918
-I guess I'll see you.
-See you.

2:02:56.001 --> 2:02:56.877
Bye.

2:03:00.130 --> 2:03:01.381
You're in so much pain, huh?

2:03:01.465 --> 2:03:02.591
-I am.
-Yeah.

2:03:06.678 --> 2:03:07.930
Oh, you're okay.

2:03:09.681 --> 2:03:10.807
So proud of you.

2:03:11.892 --> 2:03:14.228
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, we're okay.

2:03:14.311 --> 2:03:16.730
-Oh, my God, you're bleeding.
-I'm fine. I'm okay.

2:03:16.813 --> 2:03:18.232
-You sure?
-I'm fine, I promise.

2:03:18.899 --> 2:03:20.150
-Okay, okay.
-I promise.

2:03:20.234 --> 2:03:21.068
Good.

2:03:22.778 --> 2:03:24.947
We should go, right?

2:03:27.491 --> 2:03:30.285
Yeah. You're gonna forget who I am.

2:03:32.287 --> 2:03:34.581
-What?
-Forget? What are you talking about?

2:03:35.999 --> 2:03:40.712
It's okay. I'm gonna come and find you,
and I'll explain everything.

2:03:42.631 --> 2:03:44.174
I'll make you remember me.

2:03:45.008 --> 2:03:48.095
And it'll be like none of this
ever happened. Okay?

2:03:48.178 --> 2:03:51.515
But what if that doesn't work?
What if that doesn't work?

2:03:51.598 --> 2:03:53.976
What if we can't remember you?
I don't wanna do that.

2:03:54.726 --> 2:03:57.604
-I don't wanna do that.
-I know. MJ, I know.

2:03:57.688 --> 2:04:01.149
There's not something we can do?
We can't come up with a plan?

2:04:01.233 --> 2:04:02.734
There's always something we can do.

2:04:04.862 --> 2:04:06.071
There's nothing we can do.

2:04:10.701 --> 2:04:11.785
But it'll be okay.

2:04:16.290 --> 2:04:17.124
You promise?

2:04:20.294 --> 2:04:21.587
Yeah, I promise.

2:04:33.015 --> 2:04:34.516
I'll come find you, okay?

2:04:35.142 --> 2:04:36.393
I know you will.

2:04:37.895 --> 2:04:38.979
-Okay.
-Okay.

2:04:41.398 --> 2:04:42.691
You better.

2:04:44.651 --> 2:04:48.447
If you don't, I'll just figure it out.
I've done it before, I can do it again.

2:04:50.157 --> 2:04:51.658
I promise, I'll fix this.

2:04:53.035 --> 2:04:54.286
I really hate magic.

2:04:55.996 --> 2:04:57.122
Yeah. Me too.

2:05:01.877 --> 2:05:02.961
I love you.

2:05:09.384 --> 2:05:10.802
-I love--
-Just wait.

2:05:12.012 --> 2:05:14.348
Wait and tell me when you see me again.

2:05:16.350 --> 2:05:17.184
Sure.

2:06:44.980 --> 2:06:45.814
<i>I love you.</i>

2:07:24.978 --> 2:07:28.023
<i>It's been a few weeks
since the fiasco on the Statue of Liberty,</i>

2:07:28.106 --> 2:07:31.068
and Spider-Man's cultists
continue to contend

2:07:31.151 --> 2:07:33.612
that the vile vigilante is a hero.

2:07:34.488 --> 2:07:38.659
If he were a hero, he'd unmask himself
and tell us who he really is

2:07:38.742 --> 2:07:42.246
because only a coward
conceals his identity.

2:07:42.329 --> 2:07:45.499
Only a coward hides his true intentions.

2:07:45.582 --> 2:07:47.668
<i>Rest assured, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

2:07:47.751 --> 2:07:52.047
<i>this reporter will uncover
those intentions, come hell or high water.</i>

2:07:52.130 --> 2:07:55.717
Hi. My name is Peter Parker.
You don't know me, but I...

2:07:58.470 --> 2:08:01.056
Hi, my name is Peter Parker,
and you don't know me, but you--

2:08:04.852 --> 2:08:05.936
Okay, come on.

2:08:08.313 --> 2:08:09.940
-No way.
-Hard to believe, isn't it?

2:08:19.700 --> 2:08:20.701
Hey.

2:08:26.164 --> 2:08:28.625
One sec. Can I help you?

2:08:28.709 --> 2:08:29.543
Hi.

2:08:30.419 --> 2:08:33.088
My name is Peter Parker, and I...

2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:39.469
would like a coffee, please.

2:08:40.262 --> 2:08:42.472
Okay, no problem, Peter Parker.

2:08:49.062 --> 2:08:51.440
Doughnut for my fellow Engineer.

2:08:52.524 --> 2:08:55.360
-Wait, what?
-MIT, they're the Engineers. The mascot.

2:08:55.444 --> 2:08:57.946
Oh, right, right, right.
I should probably know that.

2:08:58.030 --> 2:09:02.034
-Look at you with the school spirit.
-Tell anybody, I will deny it.

2:09:02.117 --> 2:09:03.327
Oh, okay.

2:09:13.504 --> 2:09:15.714
Peter Parker? Peter Parker.

2:09:16.465 --> 2:09:17.633
Your coffee.

2:09:17.716 --> 2:09:19.009
Right. Thank you.

2:09:22.095 --> 2:09:23.555
Are you excited for MIT?

2:09:25.057 --> 2:09:27.184
Oh, right. Yeah.

2:09:28.685 --> 2:09:30.729
Yeah, I am excited, which is weird

2:09:30.812 --> 2:09:33.148
'cause I don't really
get excited about things,

2:09:33.232 --> 2:09:34.900
I kind of expect disappointment.

2:09:34.983 --> 2:09:37.277
'Cause then you'll never
actually be disappointed.

2:09:38.195 --> 2:09:39.029
Right?

2:09:42.032 --> 2:09:43.784
Yeah. Right.

2:09:45.118 --> 2:09:49.039
I don't know, it kind of feels different
this time for some reason.

2:09:59.967 --> 2:10:00.843
Right.

2:10:02.636 --> 2:10:03.637
What I was--

2:10:13.230 --> 2:10:14.064
You okay?

2:10:15.524 --> 2:10:17.067
It doesn't really hurt anymore.

2:10:28.287 --> 2:10:30.289
Is there anything else?

2:10:43.051 --> 2:10:43.886
No.

2:10:47.806 --> 2:10:48.849
Thank you.

2:10:49.850 --> 2:10:50.767
No problem.

2:10:57.232 --> 2:10:58.442
I'll see you around.

2:12:03.841 --> 2:12:04.967
How'd you know her?

2:12:08.887 --> 2:12:10.055
Through Spider-Man.

2:12:11.056 --> 2:12:11.974
You?

2:12:12.057 --> 2:12:13.100
Same.

2:12:18.689 --> 2:12:20.482
I lost a good friend a while back.

2:12:21.358 --> 2:12:22.359
Felt like this.

2:12:25.320 --> 2:12:27.739
Hurts 'cause they're gone
and then it hurts all over again

2:12:27.823 --> 2:12:29.491
because you remember
what they stood for

2:12:29.575 --> 2:12:32.619
and you wonder, "Is all that gone too?"

2:12:37.457 --> 2:12:38.709
No, it's not gone.

2:12:41.753 --> 2:12:43.380
Everyone that she helped...

2:12:45.841 --> 2:12:46.967
they'll keep it going.

2:12:48.343 --> 2:12:49.553
You really think so?

2:12:50.846 --> 2:12:51.847
I know it.

2:12:54.016 --> 2:12:57.394
-Take care of yourself, okay?
-Yeah. Nice to meet you.

2:13:04.818 --> 2:13:08.071
Rent is due on the first
of the month. Don't be late.

2:13:59.581 --> 2:14:01.792
<i>Four-three-Edward, do you need EMS assist?</i>

2:14:01.875 --> 2:14:02.876
<i>Negative, Central.</i>

2:14:03.710 --> 2:14:04.962
<i>We're gonna need a car tow.</i>

2:17:19.740 --> 2:17:20.574
Okay.

2:17:22.284 --> 2:17:23.785
Okay, I think I got this.

2:17:23.869 --> 2:17:27.581
You're saying that this whole place here,

2:17:27.664 --> 2:17:29.583
it's just tons of...

2:17:30.751 --> 2:17:32.127
superpeople.

2:17:32.210 --> 2:17:34.922
<i>And he has been saying it for hours.</i>

2:17:35.714 --> 2:17:38.842
All right, tell me again.
I'm sorry, I'm an idiot.

2:17:38.925 --> 2:17:42.763
There was a billionaire,
he had a tin suit and he could fly, right?

2:17:45.098 --> 2:17:48.101
Okay, and there was
a really angry green man.

2:17:48.184 --> 2:17:49.727
-Hulk.
-Hulk.

2:17:49.811 --> 2:17:52.189
<i>And you thought
Lethal Protector was a shit name.</i>

2:17:52.272 --> 2:17:54.316
Yeah, because it is.

2:17:54.398 --> 2:17:58.736
Now tell me again about
your purple alien that loves stones.

2:17:58.820 --> 2:18:01.490
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,
aliens do not love stones.

2:18:01.573 --> 2:18:03.575
-<i>Eddie, don't start.
</i>-They don't.

2:18:03.659 --> 2:18:05.661
Know what aliens love? Eating brains.

2:18:05.744 --> 2:18:07.913
Because that's what they do. All right?

2:18:07.995 --> 2:18:10.624
Señor, he made my family disappear.

2:18:12.041 --> 2:18:13.084
For five years.

2:18:14.503 --> 2:18:15.546
Five years?

2:18:17.840 --> 2:18:18.966
That's a long time.

2:18:21.635 --> 2:18:22.969
Maybe I...

2:18:23.053 --> 2:18:25.763
Maybe I should go to New York
and speak to this...

2:18:27.307 --> 2:18:28.308
Spider-Man.

2:18:28.392 --> 2:18:31.436
<i>Eddie, we are drunk.</i>

2:18:33.272 --> 2:18:35.732
-<i>Let's go skinny-dip!
</i>-I don't think we should skinny-dip.

2:18:35.816 --> 2:18:36.941
You have to pay the bill.

2:18:37.734 --> 2:18:39.068
<i>What is happening? No!</i>

2:18:39.152 --> 2:18:41.530
<i>No, we just got here! No, not again!</i>

2:18:46.200 --> 2:18:47.369
And there he goes.

2:18:48.077 --> 2:18:50.998
Without paying the bill, no tips, nothing.

2:26:01.553 --> 2:26:03.555
<i>Don't cast that spell.</i>

2:26:03.639 --> 2:26:05.641
<i>-It's too dangerous.
-Why?</i>

2:26:05.724 --> 2:26:08.560
<i>We tampered with
the stability of space-time.</i>

2:26:09.144 --> 2:26:14.107
<i>The multiverse is a concept
about which we know frighteningly little.</i>

2:26:16.068 --> 2:26:17.986
<i>Your desecration of reality...</i>

2:26:19.321 --> 2:26:20.656
<i>will not go unpunished.</i>

2:26:26.578 --> 2:26:27.913
<i>It was the only way.</i>

2:26:33.126 --> 2:26:37.589
<i>But I never meant
for any of this to happen.</i>

2:26:56.483 --> 2:26:57.317
Wanda.

2:26:59.611 --> 2:27:02.197
Well, I knew sooner or later
you'd show up.

2:27:03.198 --> 2:27:06.034
I made mistakes, and people were hurt.

2:27:06.118 --> 2:27:08.453
I'm not here to talk about Westview.

2:27:09.454 --> 2:27:10.747
Then what are you here for?

2:27:10.831 --> 2:27:11.832
We need your help.

2:27:13.333 --> 2:27:14.585
With what?

2:27:14.668 --> 2:27:16.295
What do you know about the multiverse?

2:27:25.179 --> 2:27:26.346
I'm sorry, Stephen.

2:27:28.807 --> 2:27:31.059
<i>I hope you understand...</i>

2:27:33.729 --> 2:27:35.439
<i>the greatest threat...</i>

2:27:36.690 --> 2:27:38.066
<i>to our universe...</i>

2:27:46.575 --> 2:27:47.784
<i>is you.</i>

2:27:50.621 --> 2:27:53.248
Things just got out of hand.
