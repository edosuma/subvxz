06:18.645 --> 06:20.147
Tonight. Christmas Eve.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.759
At a party she's throwing

06:22.916 --> 06:24.896
- You're coming with me.
- Na can do, man.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.191
I gotta stay here and smoke this weed,
otherwise I won't get high.

06:28.355 --> 06:29.629
Why not ask your roommate?

06:29.789 --> 06:32.269
Because you're the best.
I don't wanna go with him.

06:32.425 --> 06:35.463
I already asked him. He said nu.
He's spending Christmas...

06:35.629 --> 06:37.302
...with his stupid girlfriend.

06:37.597 --> 06:40.407
Mm. This is what happens.
They get a girlfriend...

06:40.567 --> 06:42.444
...then they get married...

06:42.602 --> 06:44.548
...then you never hear from them again.

06:46.940 --> 06:47.941
Fuck it, I'm in.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.250

06:51.578 --> 06:54.889
Wow, the Jewish neighbors
must hate this.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.662
Well, Harry. Harry.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.125
You have outdone yourself.

06:59.286 --> 07:00.663
If you knew Maria's dad...

07:00.820 --> 07:02.527
you'd pullout all the stops too

07:02.689 --> 07:04.691
Has not accepted you
as part of the family?

07:04.858 --> 07:08.931
Na, not yet. But he's a huge fan of
Christmas. I'm hoping when he sees...

07:09.095 --> 07:10.733
...all the work, he appreciates it.

07:10.897 --> 07:11.967
Oh, so smart.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.805
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.344
Oh. Jinx.

07:15.502 --> 07:18.449
You always do that.
You keep doing it. It's crazy.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.915
Okay, I'll Skype you later or text you.

07:21.341 --> 07:22.217
Or bath.

Your dad is gonna be here any minute,
though. Honestly, that's--

07:40.927 --> 07:43.771
- Baby. Then let's get to it.
- Oh!

07:43.930 --> 07:45.671
Because when they get here...

07:45.832 --> 07:49.871
...we are going to have no private time.

07:50.036 --> 07:51.515
I don't know if we should.

07:51.671 --> 07:54.117
Now, came an and fuck a baby into me.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.310
Okay, I will.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.655
Two-hander. Okay. Ha-ha-ha.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.818
If it's a baby I gotta give you,
it's a baby you're gonna get.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.287
Shit.

08:09.956 --> 08:11.299

08:22.836 --> 08:24.338
Hello, Harald.

08:24.771 --> 08:27.581
You made the drive in record time.
Didn't speed, did you?

08:31.478 --> 08:32.980

08:34.179 --> 08:35.419

Can I get you a beer?

08:39.486 --> 08:40.692

08:42.989 --> 08:45.833
She caught your eye, huh? Ha, ha.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.403
This is our Christmas tree.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.698
Is it fake?

08:49.095 --> 08:50.631
It's faux, actually.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.367
You celebrating real Christmas...

08:52.532 --> 08:54.170
or a faux Christmas?

08:54.334 --> 08:55.244

You take it.

09:22.962 --> 09:25.272
You people are real good
with those things.

09:27.467 --> 09:28.741
It's just the weekend.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.513

- Heh-heh-heh.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.450
This is fucked up.

<i>How about this?</i>

09:47.220 --> 09:48.995
<i>Well, it doesn't have to any more.</i>

10:21.654 --> 10:22.997
Came an in.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.500
Since when do you have a beard?

10:25.658 --> 10:28.605
I actually have not shaved since you left.
Pretty romantic.

10:28.761 --> 10:31.105
Kind <i>of</i> like Ryan Gosling
in The Notebook.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.302
When's the last time you cleaned?

10:33.466 --> 10:35.309
Like three months ago.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.538
Less romantic?

10:36.703 --> 10:38.011
Little bit, yeah.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.515
I'm sorry, where are my manners?
Here. Here.

10:40.673 --> 10:41.413
Oh, nu, nu, nu.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.019
Na, I shouldn't.

10:43.176 --> 10:44.177
Of course you should.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.051
Kumar, I really need to talk to you.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.456
I'm pregnant.

10:50.717 --> 10:51.991
You're pregnant?

10:52.318 --> 10:53.388
We..

10:53.553 --> 10:54.657
We practiced safe sex.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.802
I mean, I pulled out
and came an your back.

10:57.957 --> 10:59.231
A couple squeaks gut by...

10:59.392 --> 11:01.338
...but is that all it takes?
- Yes.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.236
That's all. Na wander
you flunked out of med school.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.934
I didn't flunk out of med school.
I failed a drug test.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.237
Haw do I even know...

11:08.401 --> 11:09.505
...that the baby's mine?

11:09.702 --> 11:12.012
I haven't slept with anyone
since we brake up.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.715
Nice.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.876
What do you want to do about it?

11:16.042 --> 11:17.214
All right, um...

11:25.985 --> 11:28.124
This is the part
where the kid's tongue...

11:28.288 --> 11:29.596
...gets stuck to a pale. Ha, ha.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.063
Oh. Ha, ha. I'm sorry.

11:32.225 --> 11:36.503
Um, are we having a conversation right now,
or are you watching <i>A Christmas</i> Story?

11:36.663 --> 11:38.267
Bath. Na.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.809
- I mean--
- You know what'? I knew you

11:40.967 --> 11:42.776
-...couldn't handle this
- I'm sorry.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.040
I'm really high.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.447
This is not about you being high.
This is about you being immature.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.780
It's why I couldn't stay here any more.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.081
You are perfectly fine
creating a mess...

11:52.612 --> 11:54.558
...but when it comes
to cleaning one up...

11:54.714 --> 11:56.193
you're MIA

11:56.349 --> 11:57.453
Give me a half hour...

11:57.617 --> 11:58.687
to sober up

11:59.052 --> 12:00.360
Fuck.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.238
Dad, you good?
You need a drink or--? Na? Okay.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.375
- Maria. I lave you.
- Ha, ha.

12:14.634 --> 12:15.772
Glad your family's here.

12:15.935 --> 12:17.005
I'm just wandering...

12:17.170 --> 12:20.982
...haw we're gonna deal with the Christmas
party with all these extra guests.

12:21.140 --> 12:23.142
We'll make it work.
We have plenty of roam.

Okay.

12:25.011 --> 12:25.853
I'm sorry.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.491
I left my wallet upstairs. Thank you.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.085
Harald.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.025
Hey, speaking of guests...

12:32.185 --> 12:34.392
...are you sure you don't
wanna invite Kumar?

12:34.821 --> 12:38.200
Kumar? You kidding me?
I haven't seen that guy in years.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.200
Kumar has been...

12:39.359 --> 12:42.203
...your friend for a long time
- It is perfectly normal.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.104
People lose half their friends
every seven years.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.972
It's not like I don't have friends.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.773
- Todd? Yeah, he's a lat of fun.
- At least he doesn't...

12:49.936 --> 12:52.075
...create a disaster everywhere he goes.

12:53.973 --> 12:54.974
Ah, okay.

13:01.447 --> 13:03.051
Rosetta Stone.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.195
A lifesaver.

13:15.928 --> 13:16.633
Be right there!

13:26.139 --> 13:28.983
Harald? He hasn't lived here in so lung.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.392
Maybe we can-

13:36.315 --> 13:37.521
Are you sure we have to

13:37.684 --> 13:39.686
-...throw it out'?
- This tree is a cancer

13:39.852 --> 13:42.230
We have to get rid of it
before it kills Christmas.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.865
Very intense warding.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.036
Wow! Oh, my Gad.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.337
I can't believe you brought the tree.
Ha-ha-ha.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.608
Am I missing something?

13:56.769 --> 13:58.942
Every Christmas we use a tree
that Dad grew.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.016
- Oh.
Twelve-fact Fraser fir.

14:01.808 --> 14:03.412
Lack at the branch distribution.

14:03.576 --> 14:04.247
Oh, I see.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.514
Hey. he!!!

14:06.346 --> 14:07.484
She's very delicate.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.923
I've been growing her for eight years.

14:10.116 --> 14:14.189
Eight years, wow. I never knew
Christmas trees were such a big deal.

14:15.555 --> 14:16.590
Oh, Gad.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.030
Nata big deal?

14:18.191 --> 14:20.364
Let me tell you a story, Harald.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.199
<i>Growing up in Medellin...</i>

14:22.362 --> 14:25.832
<i>...my family was too poor
to celebrate Christmas properly.</i>

14:28.668 --> 14:33.117
<i>"Please, let me wake up and find a big,
beautiful Christmas tree. "</i>

14:33.272 --> 14:34.751
And every Christmas...

14:35.708 --> 14:37.210
...I was heartbroken.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.415
<i>When my mother finally
moved me to America...</i>

14:40.580 --> 14:42.389
...she promised <i>me</i> we would have...

14:42.749 --> 14:46.287
<i>...a Christmas tree every Christmas
from then on.</i>

14:46.452 --> 14:50.628
<i>But one week before that first Christmas,
while walking home from work...</i>

14:50.790 --> 14:52.633
<i>...she was violently attacked...</i>

14:52.792 --> 14:54.794
...by a gang of Korean punks.

15:06.105 --> 15:09.382
<i>They stabbed her multiple times.
She bled to death.</i>

15:09.542 --> 15:10.646
So <i>I</i> guess...

15:10.810 --> 15:14.485
...you could say, yes,
a Christmas tree is a big deal

15:14.680 --> 15:15.818
Oh, my Gad.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.730
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm sorry.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.094
Pepe! Where are the ornaments?

15:22.255 --> 15:22.858
I don't know.

15:23.022 --> 15:24.296
My eyes are all fucked up.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.495
You can't celebrate Christmas
with a naked tree! It's indecent!

15:27.693 --> 15:29.536
Maria, forget about midnight Mass.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.572
Tonight, we're decorating the tree.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.109
Oh, Daddy, I wanted
to spend tonight in the city...

15:34.267 --> 15:35.473
...with you 9"guys.-

15:35.635 --> 15:36.773
Wait.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.080
I gut this.

15:39.906 --> 15:43.353
I'll take care of the tree.
You have a family night in Manhattan.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.313
Na. Na, nu, nu.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.321
We brought the tree all the way dawn.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.585
It has to lack perfect
an Christmas morning.

15:49.749 --> 15:54.255
Carlos, it will. Tell me exactly what
you want and I'll take care of it.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.696
When you came back,
the tree will be decorated.

15:56.856 --> 16:00.167
This house, I promise you,
is gonna be perfect.

16:09.435 --> 16:12.746
Oh, B-T-dub, the girl tonight?
Her name is Mary.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.010
As in the Virgin Mary.
Haw great is that?

16:15.174 --> 16:16.744
What did Vanessa do to suck...

16:16.909 --> 16:18.354
...the life out of you...

16:18.511 --> 16:19.489
...this afternoon?

16:19.946 --> 16:23.723
I don't have anyone else to confide in.
I might as well tell you. Uh...

16:24.483 --> 16:25.393
Vanessa's pregnan--

16:25.551 --> 16:26.359
A queefer.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.430
- What?
- I knew it.

16:28.588 --> 16:32.092
I used to date this black chick,
she used to queef every time we had sex.

16:32.258 --> 16:35.239
It was ridiculous.
I used to call her Queen Laqueefa.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.041
When was the last time
you saw this guy?

16:38.297 --> 16:40.106
- Two years ago.
- Sc...

16:40.266 --> 16:43.543
...why are we dropping off this package?
You said this guy was a chade.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.717
He is, all right? I just--
I don't want his shit in my place.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.979
Sure this is the right address?

16:52.144 --> 16:56.149
Whoa. Lacks like your ex-bayf's
moving up in the world. Heh.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.124
I guess.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.958
I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna drop this off.

17:21.374 --> 17:22.579
Fuck!

17:28.180 --> 17:29.488

17:31.284 --> 17:32.695
Hello, Harald.

at the apartment. So I was dropping it off.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.010
Oh. Okay, coal.

This is a really nice house.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.446
Na. You know.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.251
Do you want to come in for a drink

18:03.416 --> 18:04.588

18:04.750 --> 18:05.854
Um...

18:07.119 --> 18:09.429

18:10.790 --> 18:11.791

18:13.693 --> 18:16.367

18:22.802 --> 18:25.339
Uh... Sure. Yeah.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.542
Hey, this place is, like, not shitty.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.745
Oh. Thank you. Yeah.

18:30.910 --> 18:35.120
Bay window is brand-new, actually.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.784
The sconces are new.
Sconces are actually brand-new

18:38.150 --> 18:43.293
Yeah, I was gonna say, it looks like

18:43.856 --> 18:45.597
Thank you. That's very sweet of you.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.341

18:51.497 --> 18:53.170
I haven't lived there for so lung.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.902
I know. That's strange.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.875
Whoa.

19:02.775 --> 19:03.685
Ooh

19:05.745 --> 19:06.780
What the hell is this?

19:06.946 --> 19:08.983
That's a gigantic joint.
What do you think?

19:09.582 --> 19:10.390
Is this a joke?

19:10.983 --> 19:12.621
- Na. I swear.
- Did you do this?

19:12.785 --> 19:14.662
Had I known, I would have smoked it

19:15.154 --> 19:16.462

19:17.289 --> 19:18.165

19:18.324 --> 19:21.498

19:22.094 --> 19:23.334
What are you doing?

19:23.496 --> 19:24.270
Getting not law.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.807
Na smoking in this house.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.206
What? What douche came up
with that rule?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.170
This douche did.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.781
That was good shit.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.684
I don't care, okay?

19:40.846 --> 19:42.052
I don't smoke any more.

19:42.214 --> 19:43.693
- What?
- I just felt...

19:43.849 --> 19:45.760
...that a lat of times when I gut high...

19:45.918 --> 19:48.057
things would go really wrong. So

19:48.220 --> 19:51.224
But, Harald, weed is so good.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.698
It gets you high.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.428
I gut nothing against weed, okay?

19:54.593 --> 19:57.199
Had plenty of fun times with weed.
But I'm an adult now.

19:57.363 --> 20:00.344
And frankly, I'm kind of glad that
the craziness is behind me.

20:00.499 --> 20:02.570
Do you smell something burning?

20:03.969 --> 20:05.004
Son-1;
Oh, shit!

20:05.237 --> 20:06.739
Oh, shit.
- Shit.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.179
Shit!

20:09.041 --> 20:10.520
It's spreading. It's spreading!

20:10.676 --> 20:11.984
Here.

20:12.144 --> 20:14.146
Bah, bah, bah!
Nat the throw pillows!

20:14.313 --> 20:15.451
Seriously?

20:18.084 --> 20:19.586
I did it anyway!

20:19.752 --> 20:21.026
What the fuck?!

20:27.159 --> 20:27.933
Shit!

20:28.094 --> 20:29.266
Maria's dad will kill me!

20:29.428 --> 20:30.236
Stop yelling!

20:30.396 --> 20:32.342
We gotta get rid of this tree!

20:33.032 --> 20:34.067
Okay.

20:46.445 --> 20:49.289
That's why you gotta buy those
faux trees. They last forever.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.625
Calm dawn.
It's just a Christmas tree.

20:53.786 --> 20:54.890
"Just a Christmas tree"?

20:55.254 --> 20:57.256
Maria's dad grew that tree...

20:57.423 --> 20:58.868
...and new it is dead.

20:59.025 --> 21:02.336
Koreans have killed his mother,
and new this tree. Christmas is ruined.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.735
Christmas isn't ruined.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.773
Yes, it is. You have ruined Christmas.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.502
They're gonna came home from Mass
and expect to see...

21:08.667 --> 21:11.204
...a decorated tree,
but they are gonna see that.

21:11.704 --> 21:14.275
Dude, you're overreacting
There's plenty of tree lots

21:14.440 --> 21:16.818
We'll drive around
till we find the right tree.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.317
We're not gonna do anything.

21:19.712 --> 21:22.283
You know what? Um, this is my fault.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.689
I take full responsibility.
Please leave.

21:24.850 --> 21:26.989
I will take care of this. Thank you.

21:27.153 --> 21:29.030
- I don't mind helping out--
- I got it.

21:29.555 --> 21:30.795
- We have a van--
- I gut it.

21:33.392 --> 21:34.564
Okay. You gut it.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.173
- You need anything, just give me--
- Merry Christmas.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.938
Merry Christmas, Harald.

21:46.405 --> 21:47.713
What the fuck tank so lung?

21:47.873 --> 21:49.409
Nothing. Let's just go.

21:49.575 --> 21:53.079
You never told me Harald was Asian.
I always pictured an old white guy.

21:58.984 --> 22:01.760
Freeze! This is a rubbery.
Give me all your friendship.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.366
Oh, wow, lack at that.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.661
You know, it's kind of better
than a window.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.827
It's like a stained-glass
window of paper.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.165
Any luck with the tree?

22:09.328 --> 22:11.604
- Oh, you brought Ava.
- Uh, yeah, sorry. I have Ava.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.471
It's "SD."

22:13.632 --> 22:14.167
<i>Hmm?</i>

22:14.333 --> 22:15.334
Daddy-Daughter Day.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.503
You can't back out
of Daddy-Daughter Day...

22:17.670 --> 22:20.276
...because Emma says that
leads to abandonment issues...

22:20.439 --> 22:22.942
...and then stripping and meth
and biker boyfriend.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.281
- All bad things.
- Ah.

22:24.443 --> 22:26.514
- The tree, though.
- Yes, so I called--

22:27.680 --> 22:29.591
Oh, here it goes. Here it goes.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.092
The itsy bitsy spider

22:32.251 --> 22:33.457
<i>Crawled up the water spout</i>

22:33.619 --> 22:35.030
They say that singing is...

22:35.187 --> 22:37.292
...the best way to communicate
with a child.

22:37.456 --> 22:38.764
I guess I haven't found...

22:38.924 --> 22:40.460
...the right sang for her yet.

22:40.626 --> 22:42.503
That's tan bad. Uh, the tree?

22:42.661 --> 22:44.732
The tree. Right. Sc I called them.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.308
They had one 12-fact fir left.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.803
- And I reserved it.
- You gut it?

22:48.968 --> 22:51.812
- Yeah.
- Yes! You should have led off with that.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.678
I know. I don't know why I didn't.

22:53.839 --> 22:55.648
- Okay, good. Let's go.
- Whoa!

22:55.808 --> 22:56.752
You know.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.149
Okay. Next time.

23:03.349 --> 23:04.555
Now, before this party...

23:04.717 --> 23:07.357
...we gut to talk about your game.
- Aw, dude, turn in there!

23:07.887 --> 23:09.525
Really? A tree farm?

23:14.093 --> 23:15.003
"Best selection"...

23:15.161 --> 23:15.832
...my ass.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.202
It's Christmas Eve, okay?
What do you expect?

23:18.364 --> 23:19.570
If I was a tree farmer...

23:19.732 --> 23:22.440
...I'd be embarrassed.
These trees are ghetto.

23:22.601 --> 23:23.739
What the fuck that mean?

23:25.337 --> 23:27.783
He's just playing.
Haw you doing? I'm Latrell.

23:28.207 --> 23:29.515
Hello. Kumar.

23:29.675 --> 23:31.313
This is my partner in crime, Lamar.

23:31.477 --> 23:33.286
- Sn you two awn this tree lat?
- What?

23:33.445 --> 23:37.120
A couple of brothers can't sell trees?
Only swing from them like monkeys?

23:37.283 --> 23:40.628
What? Na! Of course nut.
You could do bath.

23:40.786 --> 23:42.288
- What?
- What?

23:42.454 --> 23:44.456
My bay here gets cagey
during the holidays.

23:44.623 --> 23:46.569
- You know?
- Ward. Ward.

23:47.193 --> 23:50.231

32:56.775 --> 33:00.484
Unless, of course, Mr. Wu-Gang Clams
would like to help with some paapy?

33:00.645 --> 33:01.646
Wu-Tang, dude.

33:01.813 --> 33:02.621
Wan-hon.

33:03.915 --> 33:05.952
Your little friend better get me a tree.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.093
I'm sorry about him, dude. I--

33:10.355 --> 33:11.663
Hey, grandpa!

33:11.823 --> 33:13.530

33:13.692 --> 33:15.797
...grandpa, dude? I'm barely 30.

33:15.961 --> 33:17.668
Wanna start? I'll kick your ass...

33:17.829 --> 33:18.830
...right now.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.101
<i>Karate Kid style.</i>

33:20.265 --> 33:20.902
Really?

33:21.066 --> 33:22.875
Which Karate Kid are you referring to'?

33:23.034 --> 33:27.210
There's only one <i>Karate</i> Kid and it stars
Jackie Chan and my man Jaden Smith.

33:27.372 --> 33:28.373
What?

33:28.540 --> 33:30.110
Generation <i>Z,</i> here's your ball.

33:31.476 --> 33:34.719
Who invited these fucking lasers?

33:34.880 --> 33:36.723
Listen, we're friends of Mary, okay?

33:36.882 --> 33:39.692
She promised us we could have that tree.
Okay? Thank you.

33:39.851 --> 33:40.659
What?

33:40.819 --> 33:42.628
Fuck that! I don't care...

33:42.787 --> 33:45.666
...what my sister said.
I'm not letting you take our tree.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.667
Uh, actually, you are, you fuckstain.

33:47.826 --> 33:48.964
Came an.

33:49.127 --> 33:51.698
We're here to pick up the tree,
then we're out of here.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.137
It's a bit of an emergency.

33:53.298 --> 33:55.403
Tell you what, we'll play you for it.

33:55.800 --> 33:56.642
If you beat us...

33:56.801 --> 33:57.905

33:58.069 --> 34:02.313
If we beat you, we kick your <i>asses</i> out and
take all your motherfucking cash. Ha, ha.

34:02.474 --> 34:05.080
I'm sorry, do you want us
to play you in beer pong?

34:05.277 --> 34:07.848
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess you guys
haven't heard of it before.

34:08.013 --> 34:08.786
Oh, nu, nu.

34:08.947 --> 34:10.483
We've heard of it, dude. Yeah.

34:10.649 --> 34:13.152
Except, see, in our day,
it was called Beirut.

34:13.318 --> 34:15.228
And we didn't have the rollback rule...

34:15.387 --> 34:16.866
...like you pussies have today.

34:17.022 --> 34:21.402
I remember the day they announced the rule.
Same day I kicked a little bitch's ass at it.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.635
You remind me a lat of that guy...

34:23.795 --> 34:25.364
...except you're shorter.

34:25.530 --> 34:26.873
And he had pubes.

34:27.132 --> 34:28.406
Oh, my Gad. I'm so excited.

34:29.301 --> 34:30.405

34:30.569 --> 34:32.344

34:32.504 --> 34:34.005
I can't believe it's happening.

34:34.172 --> 34:37.551
What's the deal? Why isn't everybody
at school trying to sleep with you?

34:37.708 --> 34:40.349
Are you kidding? No guy at school
will even touch me.

34:40.745 --> 34:41.621
Why won't they?

34:41.980 --> 34:43.458
Probably because they're scared.

34:43.614 --> 34:45.356
Well, I don't get scared.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.690
Scared of--
What are they scared of, though?

34:47.853 --> 34:49.389
Hey! Enough talk.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.376
Was it drugs? Was it semen?

It's very nice to meet you.

41:05.897 --> 41:08.241
Um, I know this is gonna be hard
for you to believe...

41:08.399 --> 41:11.403
...but your daughter, sir, was the one
who was trying to rape us.

41:11.569 --> 41:12.570
She's the raper.

41:12.737 --> 41:14.614
Na! Na, nu, nu! That is not true, Daddy.

41:14.772 --> 41:17.184
These men came in here,
I didn't know who they were.

41:17.342 --> 41:18.821
I think that they gut me drunk.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.786
Na. Miss? Miss? That's incorrect.

41:20.945 --> 41:22.322
You gut my daughter drunk?

It's all a big misunderstanding.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.594
Your children threw the party.

41:31.990 --> 41:35.938

41:46.004 --> 41:47.506

- Na! Na!

41:47.672 --> 41:49.811
Why does it always have to be "Gustav"?

41:49.974 --> 41:52.545
- Why not "Yuri and Gustav, kill them"?
- He means bath.

41:52.710 --> 41:54.121
Why can't he say bath of us?

41:54.279 --> 41:55.622
Bath of you...

41:56.481 --> 41:58.324

45:02.166 --> 45:03.975

45:04.135 --> 45:07.810
We were doing last-minute shopping

45:07.972 --> 45:09.815
...tearing that snowman a new tuchus.

45:09.974 --> 45:11.647
You are gonna catch your death...

45:11.809 --> 45:13.982
...of cold out here.
Let's get you a nice meal

45:14.145 --> 45:16.022

45:25.523 --> 45:27.764
This is why I tell you not

45:27.925 --> 45:32.738
Every single other person

45:32.897 --> 45:35.002
- I knew you'd bring that up.
- You grabbed me.

45:35.166 --> 45:37.442
You said, "Came with me
if you want to live."

45:41.506 --> 45:43.611
- Man, I don't think that's okay.
- It's fine.

45:43.775 --> 45:46.221
It's not fine! My baby's an cocaine.

45:46.677 --> 45:48.247
I'm an cocaine.

45:49.514 --> 45:50.652
I'm addicted to cocaine.

45:54.018 --> 45:55.190
Ya! Idiots!

45:56.520 --> 45:57.692
I want you to find...

45:57.855 --> 46:00.165
...the men who violated...

46:00.324 --> 46:01.701
...my daughter...

46:01.859 --> 46:04.237
...and I want you to fucking kill them!

46:05.763 --> 46:08.243
- Still hits the spat.
- I know, right?

46:08.399 --> 46:11.744
Oh, I almost forgot. Harald,
my Uncle Yaav, he threw his back cut.

46:11.903 --> 46:13.541
Sc me and him, we're not gonna...

46:13.704 --> 46:15.377
...be able to make your party.

46:15.540 --> 46:17.281
- I'm so sorry about that.
- It's okay.

46:17.442 --> 46:21.254
There's not really a-- We should get going.
We gut a Christmas tree emergency.

46:21.412 --> 46:24.723
I don't understand what it is
with you people and your trees.

46:24.882 --> 46:25.883
For us Christians

46:26.050 --> 46:28.758
...the tree is a very important
part of our holiday.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.831
Okay, don't start with this. All right?

46:30.988 --> 46:35.903
Just because your wife made you convert
doesn't mean you're not a Jew!

46:36.260 --> 46:39.400
His name is Seth Goldstein
For Christ's sake!

46:39.564 --> 46:41.703
First of all, don't ever take the Lord's...

46:41.866 --> 46:43.311
...name in vain. Secondly...

46:43.468 --> 46:44.845
...I was baptized, bitch!

46:45.503 --> 46:46.675
The second the priest...

46:46.837 --> 46:48.544
poured that holy water over me

46:48.706 --> 46:51.653
...all my Jewish neurosis and self-hatred
just washed right off.

46:51.809 --> 46:54.016
Sounds like you're enjoying
your new religion.

46:54.212 --> 46:55.418
Dude, it's the balls.

46:55.580 --> 46:57.218
These dirty Jew bastards have...

46:57.381 --> 46:58.951
no idea what they're missing

46:59.116 --> 47:01.153
Fishing! Hunting!
I tie knots an a sailboat.

47:01.319 --> 47:02.730
I made terrible investments...

47:02.887 --> 47:04.366
doesn't bother me a bit

47:04.522 --> 47:06.092
And guess what. Next week...

47:06.257 --> 47:08.703
...I have an appointment
to get uncircumcised.

47:08.860 --> 47:11.500
That's right, I'm gonna get my snozzle.

47:11.796 --> 47:15.471
Guys, I'd lave to stay and chat
but I gotta go get this tree.

47:15.633 --> 47:17.112
Christmas tree! Christmas tree!

47:20.504 --> 47:22.745
It's glorious. Isn't it Christian?

47:23.307 --> 47:24.445
Great to see you guys.

47:24.608 --> 47:26.281
See you, guys
No, wait.

47:26.611 --> 47:27.555
Excuse me!

47:27.745 --> 47:30.988
You still awe me 87 cents
for that jalapeno cheeseburger!

47:31.148 --> 47:34.891
Ah! Guess that holy water didn't
wash everything off, new did it?

47:36.654 --> 47:38.156
Gad, that tree is perfect.

47:38.322 --> 47:39.392
Let's go check it cut.

47:39.557 --> 47:40.797
Tickets, please.

47:40.958 --> 47:42.562
I'm sorry, we don't have tickets.

47:42.727 --> 47:43.899
They sold out months ago.

47:44.395 --> 47:46.466
- But--
- Step aside, please.

47:47.131 --> 47:48.804
I said step aside.

47:51.335 --> 47:52.643
Shit.

47:53.971 --> 47:56.713
You know what? Fuck it,
it's almost midnight. I give up.

47:56.874 --> 47:57.978
You can't give up yet.

47:58.876 --> 47:59.980
Lack...

48:00.144 --> 48:02.784
...I have an idea an haw we might
get that tree cut.

48:03.080 --> 48:04.582
- What?
- It's not gonna be easy.

48:04.749 --> 48:06.729
But this may be
the last chance we've gut.

48:08.019 --> 48:08.861
Here's what we do.

48:10.421 --> 48:12.264
<i>First, we need to steal some tickets.</i>

48:12.423 --> 48:15.029
<i>Then I slip off to the side
and take out the archbishop</i>

48:17.061 --> 48:18.802
<i>I head down
to the nuns' shower room.</i>

48:20.598 --> 48:23.204
<i>I didn't know the nuns
all showered in the same room.</i>

48:23.367 --> 48:25.244
Haw do you think they stay so clean?

48:26.737 --> 48:30.412
<i>While the nuns are Iezzing it out,
I'm gonna snag the key to the back room.</i>

48:30.575 --> 48:32.020
<i>What back room?</i>

48:32.176 --> 48:35.521
The back roam that the priests
are guarding. Am I going tan fast?

48:35.680 --> 48:36.681
- Na.
- Okay, good.

48:36.847 --> 48:38.690
You're in charge of distracting them.

48:38.849 --> 48:40.055
Haw the hell do I do that?

48:40.217 --> 48:42.390
<i>That's easy, you'll just use
our secret weapon.</i>

48:42.553 --> 48:47.059
Pillow fight in the altar bays' roam.
Last one there's a rotten egg.

48:48.426 --> 48:51.532
<i>Once the coast is clear, we use
the key to get into the back room.</i>

48:51.696 --> 48:53.232
<i>I guard while you kill the power.</i>

48:53.397 --> 48:55.570
<i>While everyone's trying
to turn the power</i> on...

48:55.733 --> 48:57.679
...you and <i>I will</i> get the tree.

48:57.835 --> 49:00.611
<i>We take it to your place,
and when Maria's dad comes home...</i>

49:00.771 --> 49:02.648
...and <i>sees this beautiful</i> tree...

49:02.807 --> 49:05.083
<i>...in your living room,
he'll jizz all over it.</i>

49:06.610 --> 49:07.611
What do you think?

49:09.180 --> 49:09.920
Uncle Harald.

49:10.081 --> 49:12.823
I think I see Uncle Harald aver there.

49:12.983 --> 49:15.122
What do you mean,
you see Uncle Harald?

49:19.957 --> 49:20.958
Baby?

49:21.592 --> 49:22.900
Oh, sorry, sir.

49:23.394 --> 49:24.168
It's okay, baby.

49:24.328 --> 49:26.934
They all lack alike to me tan.
Ha-ha-ha.

49:28.766 --> 49:33.010
Fuck! Midnight Mass.
Is it midnight already? Fucking midnight!

49:33.170 --> 49:34.444
Running out of time.

49:34.605 --> 49:36.915
Wait, wait, wait!
What the hell are we doing?

49:37.074 --> 49:39.350
Hold an. What the hell's going an?

49:39.510 --> 49:42.491
He almost spotted us!
I'm supposed to be at home with the tree.

49:42.647 --> 49:44.923
But why are you making
such a big deal about this?

49:45.082 --> 49:47.255
Because it is a big deal.

49:47.418 --> 49:49.955
Who gives a shit what
your father-in-law thinks?

49:50.121 --> 49:54.126
I give a shit what my father-in-law thinks.
You wouldn't understand.

49:55.459 --> 49:57.598
Na, dude, I don't understand.

49:58.195 --> 50:01.301
You got a great job, you make good money,
you don't beat your wife.

50:01.465 --> 50:03.604
What more could a Latina
father-in-law ask far?

50:03.768 --> 50:05.406
- Well...
- If I were you...

50:05.569 --> 50:07.640
...I'd tell him to eat
a cockmeat sandwich.

50:09.340 --> 50:10.717
You should not go through...

50:10.875 --> 50:12.616
...all this just to make him happy.

50:13.210 --> 50:14.985
You're right, I don't have to

50:15.613 --> 50:16.956
I want to

50:17.648 --> 50:21.391
I want him to be happy
because I want Maria to be happy.

50:21.552 --> 50:24.499
Because what makes Maria happy
is what makes me happy.

50:25.122 --> 50:25.930
Don't you get it?

50:26.090 --> 50:28.434
I don't have to be doing this.

50:28.993 --> 50:30.666
I wanna be doing this.

50:32.463 --> 50:33.464
What the fuck?

50:33.631 --> 50:36.510
Smoke break ended 10 minutes ago!
We need all bodies an-stage!

50:38.335 --> 50:41.782
Oh, my Gad, you guys aren't even

After all we've been through

54:21.692 --> 54:24.673
Oh, wow. And you stunned fans
when you said you were gay.

54:24.828 --> 54:27.934
Haw has this affected your relationship
with your partner, David?

Well, maybe this'll answer
your question.

You wanted it to lack realistic.

54:43.547 --> 54:46.289
Yeah, realistic, not fucking gay as shit.

54:46.450 --> 54:49.363
The only reason I put up

You'd like this bag of crack.

55:03.567 --> 55:04.375
Wouldn't you?

55:04.535 --> 55:07.209

55:15.946 --> 55:18.119
- Put money in my account.
- You gut it. Dane.

55:18.282 --> 55:21.058
- And sing at my niece's quinceanera.
- All right, I'll sing.

55:21.218 --> 55:23.095
- You can't fuck her!
- I can't promise.

55:23.253 --> 55:24.254
- Fine.
- Na! All right!

55:24.421 --> 55:25.229
I won't fuck her!

55:25.389 --> 55:27.164
Just let me have the rack.

55:27.324 --> 55:28.234
Excuse me, Neil'?

55:28.392 --> 55:29.530
Oh. Oh, this is--

55:29.693 --> 55:30.899
I can came back later.

55:31.061 --> 55:34.338
- Na! Na, I'm heading cut. Ha, ha.
- Na, we were just-- Hi.

55:34.498 --> 55:36.239
Bye-bye, sweet pea.

55:36.400 --> 55:38.346
- You behave yourself, peaches. Ha-ha-ha.
- Always.

55:38.502 --> 55:39.776
You guys are tan cute.

55:39.937 --> 55:40.711
Fuck you.

55:40.871 --> 55:41.440
I do lave...

55:41.605 --> 55:43.209
...that handsome man.

55:43.574 --> 55:45.019
Thank you so much for this...

55:45.175 --> 55:46.950
opportunity to work with you

55:47.111 --> 55:48.112
Sure. Came an in.

55:48.279 --> 55:49.758
What would you like to rehearse?

55:49.913 --> 55:52.052
Oh. Nothing specific.
Just some general stuff.

55:52.216 --> 55:54.822
You seemed tense.
I thought we could loosen you up.

55:54.985 --> 55:56.157
Take your sweater off.

55:57.655 --> 55:58.292
Oh, nu, nu.

55:58.455 --> 55:59.695
For a massage. Heh.

55:59.890 --> 56:02.268
David'll tell you,
these hands are magical.

56:02.893 --> 56:05.635
Well, I don't really have
anything an underneath, 50...

56:05.796 --> 56:07.935
Oh, it's okay.
It's just a couple girlfriends.

56:09.633 --> 56:11.010
New take it off.

56:11.535 --> 56:12.605
Okay.

56:16.306 --> 56:18.286
Why don't you lay an the bed?

56:28.452 --> 56:29.658
- Ow.
- Sorry.

56:34.191 --> 56:35.135
Feels good.

56:35.292 --> 56:36.999
Yeah, it does feel good.

56:37.161 --> 56:39.232
I can't... I can't...

56:39.429 --> 56:42.069
- Can I take this bra off?
- Um...

56:42.333 --> 56:44.677
- It's okay. Girlfriends.
- Ha-ha-ha.

56:45.302 --> 56:46.804
That's better.

56:46.970 --> 56:48.472
Should we do something?

56:48.639 --> 56:51.381
I don't know, I kind of wanna see
what happens next.

56:51.842 --> 56:52.820
Feels good.

56:52.976 --> 56:54.182
Oh, it's so hard.

56:54.344 --> 56:56.654
This knot an your back is so hard.

56:56.814 --> 56:58.487
Lack, don't be alarmed...

56:59.683 --> 57:03.756
...but I'm gonna squirt some lotion
on your back in about...

57:04.221 --> 57:05.495
...35 seconds.

57:05.656 --> 57:06.566
Excuse me?

57:06.723 --> 57:07.929
- Shut up.
- What the fuck?

57:08.092 --> 57:09.230
Shut the fuck up!

57:09.393 --> 57:10.497
Get the fuck off of me!

57:10.661 --> 57:12.572
You like it rough? I can play that way.

57:12.729 --> 57:14.402
Gad! I thought you were gay!

57:14.565 --> 57:16.044
I am gay. Gay for that pussy.

57:16.200 --> 57:17.201
Oh!

57:17.401 --> 57:19.438
I don't know what sick game
you're playing...

57:19.603 --> 57:21.844
...but touch me again,
I'll rip your dick off!

57:27.544 --> 57:29.455
Marty, Kumar, long time.

57:31.515 --> 57:33.620
It's Harald, actually.

57:33.784 --> 57:35.286
Ha-ha-ha. Of course it is.

57:35.486 --> 57:36.726
Came an, have a seat.

57:36.887 --> 57:40.425
Haw long has it been?
You two lack great. Have you last weight?

57:40.591 --> 57:42.195
Is that Hugo Bass? I lave it.

57:42.359 --> 57:44.396
Well, thanks. Listen, um...

57:44.928 --> 57:47.772
<i>Would you like a waffle, Mr. Harris?</i>

57:48.232 --> 57:49.609
Shut up!

57:49.800 --> 57:50.744
Gad, I hate this...

57:50.901 --> 57:52.938
...fucking PancakeBot thing.

57:53.103 --> 57:54.582
Dude, it's a WaffleBot

57:54.738 --> 57:55.876
They're awesome.

57:56.039 --> 57:56.642
WaffleThing.

57:56.807 --> 57:57.911
Get the fuck...

57:58.075 --> 57:59.452
out of my life!

58:00.110 --> 58:01.714
<i>Ouch.</i>

58:03.313 --> 58:04.257
Anyway...

58:04.414 --> 58:06.917
...what can I do for you,
my burglars of turd?

58:07.084 --> 58:09.257
Time-the-fuck-cut.
Haw are you still alive?

58:09.420 --> 58:10.592
Yeah, haw the fuck?

58:10.988 --> 58:12.331
What are you talking about?

58:12.489 --> 58:13.661
We saw you get shat.

58:14.458 --> 58:15.960
You have to be more specific.

58:16.126 --> 58:17.002
In that whorehouse

58:17.160 --> 58:17.797
In Texas.

58:17.961 --> 58:19.338
You branded a prostitute.

58:19.496 --> 58:20.065
Remember?

58:20.464 --> 58:22.068
Oh. yeah!

58:22.232 --> 58:24.405
New I remember.

58:24.802 --> 58:25.906
<i>It hurt like hell...</i>

58:26.069 --> 58:26.911
...at first.

58:27.070 --> 58:27.844
And then...

58:30.040 --> 58:31.576
...everything faded away.

58:32.376 --> 58:33.446
<i>And I went to heaven.</i>

58:35.245 --> 58:36.246
<i>It was exactly...</i>

58:36.413 --> 58:37.483
<i>...like I imagined it.</i>

58:39.483 --> 58:40.621
<i>Saint</i> Peter was there...

58:40.784 --> 58:41.785
...to <i>meet</i> me.

58:41.952 --> 58:43.454
Whoa. Na way!

58:43.620 --> 58:45.156
- NPH?
- Yup.

58:45.789 --> 58:48.497
Make roam! Make roam! VIP!

58:50.560 --> 58:53.302
<i>The chicks were hot.
The music was sick.</i>

58:53.463 --> 58:54.965
There were lasers.

58:55.132 --> 58:56.873
<i>It was like being famous...</i>

58:57.034 --> 58:59.207
...in the <i>early</i> '90s. I was about to...

58:59.369 --> 59:01.042
<i>...get my drink on, when I was...</i>

59:01.204 --> 59:03.081
<i>...interrupted by some dirty hippie.</i>

59:03.940 --> 59:05.647
Neil Patrick Harris. My man.

59:06.276 --> 59:07.812
I'm sure you recognize me...

59:08.879 --> 59:10.449
but I'm Jesus. So

59:10.981 --> 59:12.051
Jesus...?

59:12.216 --> 59:14.662
Jesus Christ. That's me.
I'm Jesus Christ, Neil.

59:14.818 --> 59:16.627
Hey, ladies.

59:16.787 --> 59:19.267
Neil Patrick Harris.
I played Private Carl Jenkins...

59:19.423 --> 59:20.868
in Starship Troopers.

59:21.091 --> 59:21.831
Wow.

59:22.059 --> 59:24.198
I lave that movie. Coal, coal. Awesome.

59:24.361 --> 59:26.170
Let's get shuts.
Keep the party going.

59:26.330 --> 59:27.240
- Who's in?
- Shuts.

59:27.397 --> 59:28.102
Sn, girls...

59:31.001 --> 59:32.776
Aw, came an.

59:32.936 --> 59:34.244
Haw did that happen already?

59:36.840 --> 59:38.080
Give me the phone to Dad.

59:39.409 --> 59:41.082
<i>This is God.
- Daddy?</i>

59:41.245 --> 59:42.952
We need to 85 NPH ASAP.

59:43.113 --> 59:44.888
He's getting a handjob in my club.

59:47.317 --> 59:49.991
Jesus, what a cockblock.

59:50.921 --> 59:52.332
Doesn't explain the gay thing.

59:52.489 --> 59:53.832
You're not gay, motherfucker.

59:53.991 --> 59:54.696
At all.

59:56.693 --> 59:59.572
That's a little something
we magicians call "misdirection."

59:59.730 --> 01:00:00.936
Little trick I learned...

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:02.099
...from Clay Aiken
What?

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:03.676
Clay Aiken's not gay?

01:00:03.834 --> 01:00:07.782
Clay's the biggest coozehound I know.
That guy gets mad gash.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:08.848
Neil, listen.

01:00:09.006 --> 01:00:10.781
I was wandering if--

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:13.012
I can get you one of those
Christmas trees?

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:14.246
Sure, no problem.

01:00:14.411 --> 01:00:15.412
How'd you know that?

01:00:15.746 --> 01:00:17.521
I can read your mind.

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:20.284
All right.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:21.554
You might be able to--?

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:24.892
Hook you up with a free WaffleBot?
You know what'? Take mine.

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:26.466
I hate that android fuck.

01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:29.466
Don't call him that, dude
What's up, WaffleBot?

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.799
Waffles are awesome.
Pancakes suck, right?

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.737
<i>I hate pancakes.</i>

01:00:33.897 --> 01:00:34.807
I know, so do I.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.672
<i>Kumar.</i>

01:00:38.035 --> 01:00:38.877
Thanks, Neil.

01:00:39.036 --> 01:00:40.106
- Thanks.
- Na problem.

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:43.114
Hey, merry Christmas, guys.
We'll see you in the fourth one.

01:00:44.675 --> 01:00:48.020
Gad, this is amazing. We're
actually gonna make it home before they do.

01:00:48.178 --> 01:00:50.454
- We saved Christmas, man.
- Mission accomplished.

01:00:50.614 --> 01:00:52.890
- All right, put dawn the tree. Put it dawn.
- Unh!

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:54.687
All right.
- Waffle break?

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:56.762
All right. Oh, Gad.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.627
Oh, my God. WaffleBot

01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:59.893
Dude, seriously...

01:01:00.057 --> 01:01:01.832
...these are incredible waffles.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:04.598
<i>Kumar and WaffleBot friends forever.</i>

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:06.938
Ha, ha. No doubt, WaffleBot

01:01:07.097 --> 01:01:08.701
<i>I</i> love you...

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:10.538
...Kumar.
- Ha, ha.

01:01:10.701 --> 01:01:12.078
I lave you tan, little guy.

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:13.274
What the fuck?

01:01:13.437 --> 01:01:15.007
That is the weirdest fucking toy.

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:16.447
You're happy

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:19.086
See? You're laughing.
You're having fun. Admit it:

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:21.188
I'm more fun to hang out with than Todd.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.984
Todd and Ava.
I totally forgot about them.

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:25.790
I'm sure they're fine, right?

01:01:25.949 --> 01:01:27.257
It's going to voice-mail

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:29.226
I think they're fine.
Todd's a big bay.

01:01:29.386 --> 01:01:31.525
He's probably putting her
to bed or something.

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:34.497
Yeah. They're probably fine, right?

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:39.102
Look at me, <i>look</i> at me!

01:01:39.262 --> 01:01:40.969
<i>Why wasn't you at school today?</i>

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:42.303
<i>I went to the park.</i>

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:43.602
<i>she lying-</i>

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.246
<i>What was you doing?
You supposed to be at school.</i>

01:01:47.571 --> 01:01:49.642
<i>Little girl, I'm not gonna
ask you no more.</i>

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:53.845
<i>I'm not smart like the other kids.
I can't do that stuff.</i>

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.546
<i>Who told you that?</i>

01:01:55.746 --> 01:01:57.851
<i>My last foster mother.</i>

01:01:58.014 --> 01:02:01.962
<i>She told me that the only thing I'm gonna
be smart enough to do is lay on my back.</i>

01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:05.066
The best revenge you <i>can</i> have
on somebody that told you that...

01:02:06.423 --> 01:02:09.495
<i>'s to prove them wrong. I went to
that school and I got your homework</i>

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:12.607
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:02:13.697 --> 01:02:14.437
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:16.535
Maybe that's Todd.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.541
Whoa, why is Vanessa calling you?

01:02:18.702 --> 01:02:20.306
Oh, that's because Maria is--

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:21.710
<i>- Hello?
- Kumar?</i>

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:22.976
<i>- Is that you?
- Yeah.</i>

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:24.676
Why are you calling Harald?

01:02:25.676 --> 01:02:27.087
Can I just speak to him, please?

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.655
What? Na.

01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:30.052
I've been texting you.

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:31.954
<i>I haven 't heard back.
What's going on?</i>

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:33.287
Tell him I'm not gonna...

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:35.020
<i>...make it to his party tomorrow.</i>

01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:37.961
Oh. Oh, you're not gonna make it--

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:40.101
She won't make it to your party.
Tan bad.

01:02:40.256 --> 01:02:42.497
What else have you been
doing behind my back?

01:02:42.659 --> 01:02:44.798
Has she seen your dick?
Is it bigger than mine?

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:47.567
Kumar, you're acting ridiculous, okay?
Goodbye.

01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:49.506
<i>No, don't hang up the phone on me.</i>

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.072
Hello?

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:53.812
Here's your phone.

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:54.875
What is that?

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:57.575
That's Vanessa, Todd,
Rosenberg, Uncle Yaav.

01:02:57.741 --> 01:02:59.584
Does everybody know
about this party?

01:02:59.743 --> 01:03:01.780
Listen, if you want you can came.

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:04.516
I don't wanna came to your
shitty-ass party, dude.

01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:06.922
I can't believe you'd invite
Vanessa and not tell me.

01:03:07.084 --> 01:03:08.688
Am I supposed to feel bad?

01:03:08.852 --> 01:03:12.356
Maybe if you acted more like an adult,
you'd get invited to adult parties.

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:14.729
Maybe you should go back
to your fancy house...

01:03:14.891 --> 01:03:17.167
with your douchey friends
and gay-ass sconces.

01:03:17.327 --> 01:03:18.806
I don't need to be part of this.

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:20.270
I love those sconces

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:22.910
You know, I was really happy
till you showed up today.

01:03:23.066 --> 01:03:24.875
Okay. Well, then, fuck it, dude.

01:03:25.035 --> 01:03:26.514
- I'm cut.
- Fine with me.

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:27.205
Fine.

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:28.610
- Coal.
- All right.

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:30.752
- Are we having lovers' quarrel?
- Oh, shit.

01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:39.792
<i>Kumar, my friend.</i>

01:03:42.719 --> 01:03:43.993
Oh, lack.

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:45.064
A WaffleBot

01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:45.858
Mary would...

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:47.467
...lave one of these.
- Uh-huh.

01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:48.762
Grab it.

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.632
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

01:03:56.266 --> 01:03:57.506
Wake up!

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:00.777
Wake up! Wake up!

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:02.676
Wake up.

01:04:04.374 --> 01:04:05.876
- Wake up.
- Oh.

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:07.678
Oh, shit.

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:10.619
Please, I don't know what we've dune,
but please let us go.

01:04:10.781 --> 01:04:13.159
After you made Eiffel Tower an Mary?

01:04:13.316 --> 01:04:14.659
That was a misunderstanding.

01:04:14.818 --> 01:04:16.764
I'm freezing!
Give us back our clothes.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.797
Yuri, warm them up.

01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:25.531
Kumar.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:26.799
Please don't do that.

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:30.274
Please, please, please.
There is a very serious gas crisis...

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:32.674
...in the world. Let's discuss.
- Came an, man!

01:04:32.836 --> 01:04:35.612
As they say in my country:

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.519
<i>Na, don't say "do svidaniya."</i>

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:40.214
Came an.

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:44.848
You didn't get the lighter.

01:04:45.015 --> 01:04:48.462
You said gasoline, Orbits and coffee.

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:49.858
Nothing about lighter.

01:04:50.153 --> 01:04:51.291
You stupid...

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:53.627
...fucking moron!

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:55.325
You're such a fuck-up!

01:04:57.427 --> 01:04:58.132
Oh, shit.

01:05:05.969 --> 01:05:06.947
Hey, guys, stop!

01:05:07.103 --> 01:05:09.447
Stop! Guys, guys, stop it, stop it.

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:14.151
Now, lack, I understand that you guys
have your issues, okay?

01:05:14.477 --> 01:05:18.448
But wasn't there a time you actually
used to get along? You might be in...

01:05:18.615 --> 01:05:22.188
...a different time and place,
but that doesn't change the fact that you...

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:25.196
...have a long and probably
beautiful history together.

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:30.597
Yeah, maybe one of you fucks up
every new and again.

01:05:31.061 --> 01:05:32.335
Happens.

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:34.907
Maybe he fucks up all the time.

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:38.206
Doesn't mean the other should
forget about the good times.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:39.773
Right.

01:05:41.838 --> 01:05:43.010
Right.

01:05:43.173 --> 01:05:48.122
Yeah, and maybe just
because the other one...

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:50.155
...is trying to act like an adult...

01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:53.021
...and be responsible
doesn't necessarily mean...

01:05:53.183 --> 01:05:55.185
...that he's being a fucking chade.

01:05:55.719 --> 01:05:59.326
Maybe he's been a chade,
caring more about bay windows...

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:01.935
...and sconces
than a lifetime of friendship

01:06:04.094 --> 01:06:05.129
What do you say, guys?

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.238
- Yeah, hug it cut.
- All right.

01:06:13.103 --> 01:06:13.638
Hey, guys.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.578
Haw about you cut us cut?

01:06:15.872 --> 01:06:17.909
We'll go get ourselves
a Christmas beer.

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:20.020
- A beer sounds great.
- Awesome.

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:22.612
But first...

01:06:22.779 --> 01:06:24.383
...we have some killing to do.

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:25.218
Came an!

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:27.122
After we just had that breakthrough?

01:06:27.283 --> 01:06:30.594
Sorry. Say your goodbyes.
It'll all be aver quick.

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:35.266
- Is this haw we die?
- I think so, dude.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:37.961
Bye, Kumar.

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:40.405
Bye, Harald.

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.068
Kumar.

01:06:42.232 --> 01:06:43.438
Your waffles...

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.102
...are ready.
- WaffleBot?

01:06:46.903 --> 01:06:49.315
These guys think pancakes
are better than waffles.

01:06:49.606 --> 01:06:50.778
<i>I</i> hate...

01:06:50.941 --> 01:06:52.545
...pancakes.

01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:00.117
<i>They serve pancakes...</i>

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:02.126
...in <i>hell.</i>

01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:05.256
Ooh!

01:07:08.324 --> 01:07:09.530
Holy shit!

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:11.070
You hurt my brother!

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:18.936
Whoa!

01:07:20.103 --> 01:07:22.276
- Haw do we get out of these rapes?
- WaffleBot.

01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:24.350
<i>Kumar.</i>

01:07:24.808 --> 01:07:26.378
Can you untie us?

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:27.611
<i>Battery low.</i>

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.256
Losing...

01:07:29.412 --> 01:07:30.550
power.

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:31.748
WaffleBot, lack at me.

01:07:31.915 --> 01:07:32.985
You can do this, man.

01:07:44.928 --> 01:07:47.807
- Ha, ha.
- Oh, man. Thanks, WaffleBot.

01:07:48.498 --> 01:07:50.239
<i>You're welcome, Kumar.</i>

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.645
<i>Pancakes are fucking gay.</i>

01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:01.051
Holy shit. That is the best
Christmas toy ever.

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:03.150
I guess. It's extraordinarily...

01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:05.657
...unsafe, but it did save our lives.

01:08:07.216 --> 01:08:08.786
- Listen, man, I--
- Man, this--

01:08:08.952 --> 01:08:10.989
- Aah!
- Oh, my Gad.

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:13.191
Holy shit!

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:14.868
This is like that...

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.560
...scene from <i>A Christmas</i> Story.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.865
<i>Is it like the scene from
A Christmas Story?</i>

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:20.404
I just saw this scene.

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:23.499
- Oh, fuck!
- Okay, we need...

01:08:23.666 --> 01:08:26.203
...same sort of a warm liquid.
I'll spit an it.

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:28.109
Don't fucking spit an my dick!

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:29.511
Fine. Can you pee an it?

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:31.218
Give me a second.

01:08:32.008 --> 01:08:33.919
- It's not working.
- Fine, I'll pee an it.

01:08:34.077 --> 01:08:35.147
Don't pee an me!

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:36.790
Jesus! Well, then what the hell do--?

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:39.290
- Oh. Our clothes.
- Oh.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:40.756
Coal about the clothes.

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:42.760
My dick's stuck to a pale!

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:47.624
Dude, you're in luck.
There's still coffee in here.

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.497
Get it aver here. Hurry the fuck up!

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:51.866
Okay, lack, this is scalding hat coffee.

01:08:52.028 --> 01:08:55.770
So I'm just gonna pour a little bit on.
Probably gonna sting for a second.

01:08:55.932 --> 01:08:57.343
- Get it aver with!
- All right.

01:08:57.533 --> 01:08:58.671
Just let me just--

01:09:00.537 --> 01:09:01.412
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck!

01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:02.777
Oh, fuck! I'm sorry, dude!

01:09:02.939 --> 01:09:04.417
Oh, Gad, I ruined your dick!

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:05.746
You asshole!

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:07.216
Just walk it off.

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:08.912
Walk it Off.

01:09:12.849 --> 01:09:14.850
Haw long are we supposed
to stay in here?

01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:17.691
Until that fucking Russian sociopathic...

01:09:17.854 --> 01:09:19.127
...killing machine leaves.

01:09:22.692 --> 01:09:25.104
They gave my daughter ecstasy.

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:29.107
I don't know Russian,
but he seems a little upset.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:30.710
I'd say so. Shh, shh!

01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:32.273
She's crashing hard.

01:09:32.435 --> 01:09:34.038
We gotta give her more blow.

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:35.478
Na, nu! Na more cocaine!

01:09:35.638 --> 01:09:36.514
I need it!

01:09:36.671 --> 01:09:38.709
- There's some.
- Do not give her more!

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:39.944
Give it to me!

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.179
Ava, nu! Na, please!

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:42.845
Stop for Daddy. Shh, shh! Please!

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:44.484
Dude, lack.

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:45.625
Oh, this is not good!

01:09:45.782 --> 01:09:46.886
Oh, this is not good.

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:48.118
Oh, this is not good!

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:50.962
Ava! <i>Scooch</i> to Daddy!
Hide behind Daddy!

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.327
New plan. Let's bash through the dour.

01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:54.491
You steal his gun.

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:56.637
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard!

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:19.119
Yah!

01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:22.328
Oh, fuck me. Fuck. I'm--

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.228
I'm so sorry. Wow.

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:27.994
I thought that would
knock you out, obviously.

01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:29.329
Lack. We are...

01:10:29.492 --> 01:10:30.766
...two reasonable guys...

01:10:30.927 --> 01:10:32.634
...and...

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.210
These are dangerous,
but, aw, it's a great workout.

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:42.350
You can really feel it.

01:10:42.505 --> 01:10:45.247
Bis, peas, this one.

01:10:45.508 --> 01:10:47.078
Thank you, Adrian.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:49.086
That was a really great team effort.

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:51.054
Who's my sidekick? You are.

01:10:51.214 --> 01:10:51.817
Let's go.

01:10:51.981 --> 01:10:54.860
Goad girl! Let's go home!
Let's go see Santa.

01:10:55.285 --> 01:10:56.025
Oh, mints!

01:10:58.121 --> 01:10:58.861
Mm.

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:02.526
Where the fuck are we?

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:05.400
Those guys weren't kidding.
We're in the middle of nowhere.

01:11:07.063 --> 01:11:08.167
Do you have any bars'?

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:10.737
- I gut no bars.
- Shit. Nothing here.

01:11:11.167 --> 01:11:12.441
Hello?

01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:15.743
Anybody here?

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:17.746
Forget it. Just-

01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:19.585
Forget it. It's past 2 a.m.

01:11:19.742 --> 01:11:22.586
They're home, wandering where I am,
where the tree is.

01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:23.917
I just--

01:11:24.714 --> 01:11:26.785
It's such a disaster, this fucking night.

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:28.930
Yeah, you have no fucking idea, dude.

01:11:29.085 --> 01:11:30.325
Na. When Maria's dad...

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:32.989
...was a young bay in Medellin-
- Vanessa's pregnant.

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:34.595
What?

01:11:34.757 --> 01:11:37.499
She told me earlier today.
My reaction was not awesome.

01:11:38.328 --> 01:11:40.934
I thought weed stunted fertility.
That's why I quit.

01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:43.509
Yeah. Tell that to Snoop's kids.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.805
Wait a second,
that's why you quit weed?

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:47.514
Yeah, that's why I--

01:11:48.972 --> 01:11:52.442
We've been trying for like a...
For a year.

01:11:52.609 --> 01:11:53.917
Oh, man.

01:11:54.077 --> 01:11:56.216
New I feel even worse about your dick.

01:11:56.412 --> 01:11:57.652
I don't wanna--

01:11:57.814 --> 01:11:58.918
Haw do we get cut?

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:02.585
I gut an idea.

01:12:05.421 --> 01:12:06.957
I saw this in a movie, man.

01:12:07.123 --> 01:12:09.501
Just shunt this motherfucker,
people came.

01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:10.660
We can find people.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:13.137
Na, it's fine. Aah!

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:17.838
New what?

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:19.639
I don't know.

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:24.849
Na fucking way.

01:12:35.318 --> 01:12:36.661
Santa, can you hear me?

01:12:36.819 --> 01:12:38.298
Oh, what the fuck?

01:12:38.454 --> 01:12:41.958
Lie still. You've been in a terrible accident.
I'm gonna take a closer lack.

01:12:43.893 --> 01:12:44.530
Oh, Gad!

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:45.536
This isn't good.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:47.038
Mr. Claus, can you feel...

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:47.765
...any of this?

01:12:49.499 --> 01:12:51.001
Just let me die, please!

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:52.544
Let me die in peace!

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:55.376
No. Nobody's dying, Claus
Not on my watch.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:58.212
Listen to me. I need you to go
into Santa's gift bag...

01:12:58.374 --> 01:13:00.581
...get as many medical supplies
as you can.

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:12.158
Oh, Gad!

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:15.228
Aah!

01:13:18.161 --> 01:13:19.606
Ah, there.

01:13:19.929 --> 01:13:21.101
I think that'll do it.

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:22.604
Haw do you feel, Mr. Claus?

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:24.675
Uh, a little woozy

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:26.438
The morphine. It'll wear off.

01:13:26.603 --> 01:13:28.810
Nice. But I...

01:13:28.972 --> 01:13:29.950
...think I'm okay.

01:13:30.106 --> 01:13:33.315
Lack, Santa, we're so sorry.

01:13:33.476 --> 01:13:35.752
Oh, I know it wasn't your fault.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:38.153
You two have always been good bays.

01:13:38.948 --> 01:13:40.552
Tell that to my father-in-law.

01:13:40.717 --> 01:13:43.527
Hey, man, I can take the blame
for that, all right?

01:13:43.686 --> 01:13:45.757
Listen, I'd lave to stay and chat...

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:48.994
...but I'm running a little late
and I have all these...

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:51.035
...presents to deliver.

01:13:51.194 --> 01:13:53.196
Sc you guys need a ride
or something?

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:54.834
Seriously?

01:13:55.298 --> 01:13:57.539
Ha, ha. Dude, this is awesome!

01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.407
It's not not awesome!

01:14:00.036 --> 01:14:01.344
On, Blitzen Hyah!

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.458
Thanks for the ride.

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:19.896
I'm guessing...

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:22.229
you don't have a 12-foot Fraser fir'?

01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:23.994
Sorry. I can't help you there.

01:14:24.494 --> 01:14:25.234
Besides...

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:26.896
...I gave you your present.

01:14:27.063 --> 01:14:28.736
- You did?
- Yes.

01:14:28.898 --> 01:14:30.138
You gut my package, right?

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:30.970
The joint?

01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:32.741
- That was you?
- Yeah.

01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:35.644
It was my little way of bringing
you bays back together.

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:38.976
Dude...

01:14:39.275 --> 01:14:41.516
...I'd really like it
if you came over tomorrow.

01:14:41.744 --> 01:14:43.485
Won't be a party unless you're there.

01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:45.785
It's about fucking time, Roldy.

01:14:46.182 --> 01:14:47.923
I wouldn't miss it, man.

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:54.429
By the way, for what it's worth...

01:14:54.891 --> 01:14:56.268
you'd make a great dad

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.534
Well, I guess...

01:14:58.694 --> 01:15:00.901
...this is goodbye, Roldy.
Be a good bay...

01:15:01.063 --> 01:15:01.973
...next year.

01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:03.132
All right.

01:15:03.299 --> 01:15:06.337
Na more jerking off into a sack
filled with baby powder.

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:09.343
- .L..
- Ha, ha. Don't worry.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:11.109
I'm just teasing you.

01:15:11.274 --> 01:15:12.617
I do it tan.

01:15:16.112 --> 01:15:21.027
On, Prancer! On, Comet!
On, Blitzen! Hyah!

01:15:23.653 --> 01:15:25.633
Merry Christmas, Roldy

01:15:36.933 --> 01:15:38.071
Where's the tree?

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:44.980
It's, um...

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.746
Okay, what happened is that, um...

01:15:48.678 --> 01:15:50.055
You said you were going to

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:52.819
...take care of it.
New where's the tree?

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:55.485
What happened to the tree is, uh...

01:15:56.452 --> 01:15:57.897
...I kind of burned it dawn.

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:01.732
That tree was a Perez...

01:16:01.891 --> 01:16:03.564
...family tradition.

01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:05.672
You ruined Christmas!

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:08.100
Ha, ha. I ruined your--?

01:16:08.264 --> 01:16:09.766
You ruined my Christmas, man!

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:12.542
Heh, heh. Do you know what happened'?

01:16:12.702 --> 01:16:16.377
Uh, I inadvertently introduced
a baby to cocaine.

01:16:16.539 --> 01:16:20.077
I was almost burned alive
by Ukrainian gangsters.

01:16:20.243 --> 01:16:21.779
I was drugged by...

01:16:21.944 --> 01:16:25.118
asshole teenagers. Then I danced
in a Christmas extravaganza.

01:16:25.281 --> 01:16:27.227
And I'm a terrible dancer.

01:16:27.383 --> 01:16:28.919
I almost had my dick ripped off.

01:16:29.285 --> 01:16:30.457
And then I shat...

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:34.397
...Santa Claus in the fucking face.
He's real, and I shat him in the face.

01:16:34.557 --> 01:16:35.297
Why?

01:16:36.392 --> 01:16:37.598
Because I wanted you...

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.434
...to have a perfect
fucking Christmas.

01:16:40.863 --> 01:16:42.365
Now, here's a newsflash:

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:44.511
This is my house.

01:16:44.667 --> 01:16:46.738
Maria is my wife.

01:16:46.903 --> 01:16:49.884
And if you want to be in our family...

01:16:50.139 --> 01:16:52.710
you best show me some
fucking respect.

01:16:55.378 --> 01:16:56.618
Is that tan much?

01:16:59.148 --> 01:17:00.149
I like it

01:17:00.316 --> 01:17:01.727
- Really?
- Lack.

01:17:02.085 --> 01:17:04.156
I always knew you were a nice guy.

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:06.798
But that's not enough
to be with my Maria.

01:17:06.956 --> 01:17:08.299
I didn't want her to be...

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:10.095
...with some wimpy pussy.

01:17:11.093 --> 01:17:12.037
But you

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:14.037
You showed me you got cojones.

01:17:14.197 --> 01:17:15.107
Testicles, right?

01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:17.410
Rosetta Stone.

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:20.270
- You know what?
- What's that?

01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:22.149
This coming Easter...

01:17:23.606 --> 01:17:25.347
you guys come to my house

01:17:25.541 --> 01:17:28.750
That would really be great.
Thank you, Carlos.

01:17:28.911 --> 01:17:29.616
Mr. Perez.

01:17:29.779 --> 01:17:30.849
Mr. Perez.

01:17:44.327 --> 01:17:45.499
Fuck!

01:17:46.562 --> 01:17:47.165
Kumar!

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:48.308
Jesus!

01:17:48.464 --> 01:17:52.776
I'm sorry. I was gonna use the doorbell
but I didn't want to wake your parents.

01:17:52.935 --> 01:17:55.211
What--? What are you doing?
You can't just--

01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:56.714
Hold an. There's something...

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:58.283
...I need to say to you, okay?

01:17:58.441 --> 01:18:01.854
When you told me you were pregnant,
I admit I was scared as shit.

01:18:02.378 --> 01:18:04.688
The more I think about it,
the more excited I am.

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:06.683
I mean, I lave kids.

01:18:07.083 --> 01:18:08.619
That's because you are a kid.

01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:12.561
I know. But... Lack, if you
give me another chance...

01:18:12.722 --> 01:18:17.228
..l promise you I will go back to the
medical board, I'll get my job back.

01:18:17.393 --> 01:18:19.066
I'll even quit weed if I have to

01:18:19.228 --> 01:18:20.468
You'd quit weed?

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:23.236
Of course. I would do anything for you.

01:18:23.399 --> 01:18:26.209
When I saw what Harald did
for his family tonight...

01:18:26.369 --> 01:18:28.679
...it made me realize
haw important you are to me.

01:18:28.838 --> 01:18:31.341
I wish I would've realized that sooner.

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:33.186
You don't have to do this.

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:35.884
I know I don't have to

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:38.055
I want to

01:18:43.819 --> 01:18:44.889
Do me a favor

01:18:45.054 --> 01:18:46.158
Yeah, anything.

01:18:48.658 --> 01:18:50.001
Don't quit weed.

01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:51.433
What?

01:18:51.627 --> 01:18:54.437
Just remember,
next time you take a drug test...

01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:55.768
...use my pee.

01:18:56.766 --> 01:18:57.904
I lave you.

01:18:58.367 --> 01:18:59.675
I lave you tan.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.786
Let's have some sex
before you get all fat an me.

01:19:21.891 --> 01:19:23.700
Oh, my Gad. Oh, my Gad!

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:25.805
Harald! Wake up! Baby.

01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:29.469
- It's pink.
- Oh, my Gad.

01:19:29.665 --> 01:19:31.804
- It's pink.
- It's a miracle.

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:33.603
It's a miracle.

01:19:34.971 --> 01:19:36.075
It's a miracle!

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:37.478
It's a miracle!

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.580
Isn't this the mast beautiful tree
you've ever seen?

01:19:41.043 --> 01:19:43.114
I came downstairs this morning...

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:44.758
...and here she was.

01:19:49.051 --> 01:19:50.257
Gad bless us, everyone!

01:21:08.564 --> 01:21:11.977
Ha-ha-ha! Merry Christmas!
