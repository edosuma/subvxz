00:06.300 --> 00:06.900
Hi

00:06.901 --> 00:08.101
Hey!

00:09.802 --> 00:11.202
I'm Tessa

00:11.203 --> 00:12.703
4C

00:12.704 --> 00:14.204
Hi! Uh... Eli

00:14.205 --> 00:16.004
Penthouse A

00:16.105 --> 00:18.705
I just moved in over the weekend, from Buffalo

00:18.706 --> 00:21.106
Oh yeah?  Um... Welcome to the building!

00:21.107 --> 00:22.407
And the West Coast

00:22.408 --> 00:23.508
Thank you!

00:23.509 --> 00:25.209
Yeah, it's been kind of a whirlwind

00:25.210 --> 00:27.910
New job, new apartment, new life

00:27.911 --> 00:30.211
Did the new life thing myself last year

00:30.212 --> 00:32.512
Really?  So you're an expert then

00:32.512 --> 00:34.813
Hah! Happy to share my insights

00:34.814 --> 00:36.214
It's the least I can do

00:38.315 --> 00:40.215
I thought they got these things fixed

00:42.016 --> 00:42.816
What do you mean?

00:42.817 --> 00:45.117
That I thought they fixed these things

00:51.318 --> 00:52.718
What?

00:52.719 --> 00:58.619
It's a vision... it's a vision... it's a vision... vision!!!!

01:03.820 --> 01:07.020
Um... It was really nice meeting you

01:09.821 --> 01:11.221
Yeah

01:11.222 --> 01:14.022
I'm going crazy!  What the hell are you gonna do about it?

01:15.223 --> 01:16.323
Well?

01:16.324 --> 01:17.724
Can't you let me have my english muffin first?

01:17.725 --> 01:20.325
That man is driving me out of my mind

01:20.326 --> 01:23.026
Which man exactly is behind the Patty-Go-Bunkers week?

01:23.027 --> 01:25.127
Jim Norris, annoying accountant

01:25.128 --> 01:30.828
The guy you know that Jordan in his infinite
stupidity decided to rent out office space to

01:30.829 --> 01:32.529
We need the money Patty

01:32.530 --> 01:36.430
Recently the firm's been hemorraging worse than my brain

01:36.431 --> 01:38.831
You're gonna represent the me after I kill him, right?

01:38.832 --> 01:44.932
Because I'm gonna need one hell of a lawyer to get me off
after the jury hears the gory details of what I did to him

01:44.933 --> 01:47.633
The guy pays his rent on time and in full

01:47.634 --> 01:49.434
He won't stop bothering me, Eli!

01:49.435 --> 01:53.435
Patty, the coffee machine is out of filters.
Patty, the copier's jammed

01:53.436 --> 01:55.536
Patty, the men's room is out of TP

01:55.537 --> 01:57.137
I don't do TP!

01:57.138 --> 01:59.638
You made that memorably and terrifyingly clear the day we met

02:00.939 --> 02:02.439
Let me be clear Taylor

02:02.440 --> 02:05.840
The odds of Jordan Wethersby winning the Joel T. Belmont award this year

02:05.841 --> 02:10.241
Are somewhere between when pigs fly and when hell freezes over

02:10.241 --> 02:11.442
Hold on

02:11.443 --> 02:12.443
Room service

02:13.744 --> 02:16.344
You do realize I placed this order over an hour ago

02:16.345 --> 02:18.845
Apologies sir, the kitchen's packed up

02:18.846 --> 02:20.846
Sweetheart, with the firm's precarious financial situation

02:20.847 --> 02:26.647
I'm not sure we should be spending money buying a table
at an award's dinner where I am not going to win an award

02:28.348 --> 02:30.948
Fine, if it's so important to you then purchase the table

02:30.949 --> 02:32.949
I'll be at the office soon

02:38.550 --> 02:41.150
I ordered an eggwhite only omelette

02:41.151 --> 02:43.851
This is the third order you people have screwed up already this week

02:43.852 --> 02:45.252
How terrible for you

02:45.253 --> 02:45.853
Excuse me?

02:45.854 --> 02:48.754
Oh, I'm just expressing sympathy for your whole omelette tragedy

02:48.755 --> 02:50.955
How terrible to have to eat yellow eggs

02:50.956 --> 02:52.656
I'm really sorry

02:52.657 --> 02:53.657
Don't leave

02:54.658 --> 02:56.358
I'd like the name of your supervisor

02:56.359 --> 02:57.559
So you can get me fired?

02:57.560 --> 02:58.860
I don't know who you think you are

02:58.861 --> 03:01.961
But you can't talk to people like this

03:01.962 --> 03:03.362
You just talked to me like this

03:03.363 --> 03:04.863
You think because you live in a hotel room

03:04.864 --> 03:07.664
You wear a 5.000 dollar suit, you're better than me?

03:07.665 --> 03:10.065
If anything that makes you worse

03:10.066 --> 03:11.366
Makes you just like the rest of them

03:11.367 --> 03:12.167
The rest of whom?

03:12.168 --> 03:12.968
What do you care?

03:12.969 --> 03:15.769
You... obviously have something you wanna say

03:15.770 --> 03:16.870
Why don't you say it?

03:18.171 --> 03:22.071
Them is guys like you

03:22.672 --> 03:26.272
Modern day rubber bearants that are sucking this country dry

03:29.673 --> 03:32.573
As it happens I'm an attorney

03:32.574 --> 03:36.474
And I used to represent many of those rubber bearants

03:36.475 --> 03:40.975
Well I used to work for them.  Why did you stop?

03:40.976 --> 03:43.776
We had a mutual parting of the ways

03:43.777 --> 03:44.777
Yourself?

03:44.778 --> 03:46.878
I just had a transition to food service

03:46.879 --> 03:48.679
You were fired

03:48.680 --> 03:51.280
I think the fashionable term is downsized

03:51.281 --> 03:52.681
You were fired for cause?

03:52.682 --> 03:54.882
If by that you mean, did they have a reason? Yeah!

03:54.883 --> 03:59.783
Yeah, they had to give Clayton Wells the 
ex-CEO a 43 million dollars severance

03:59.784 --> 04:02.984
So to come up with the money they 
laid off me and 300 of my co-workers

04:02.985 --> 04:06.685
Have you considered suing to get your old job back?

04:06.686 --> 04:10.586
First thing I thought  of before I realized there probably 
weren't too many lawyers willing to work for free

04:10.587 --> 04:16.387
Oh, as luck would have it.  You brought 
the wrong eggs to the right lawyer

04:16.387 --> 04:18.788
Complete and total victory

04:18.789 --> 04:20.389
Thank Applematics

04:20.390 --> 04:22.790
Mr. Allen's unconditional surrender

04:22.791 --> 04:27.391
Make the best to ruin the day they dared to sue a client, a Posner client

04:27.392 --> 04:28.292
Not to worry sir

04:28.293 --> 04:30.693
Shaken Technologies won't pay a dime in damages

04:30.694 --> 04:32.794
Yes?  Ms. Dekker?

04:32.795 --> 04:36.795
Oh I, I thought Matt Dowd was handling Shaken

04:36.796 --> 04:38.796
Mr. Dowd has left us

04:38.797 --> 04:43.697
For the decidedly ungreener pasters of Wethersby Stone and Associates

04:43.698 --> 04:48.098
Summing forth oh it gives me great pleasure to announce that

04:48.099 --> 04:49.899
According to inside sources

04:49.900 --> 04:54.800
One of our very own has at long last 
been nominated for the California Bar's

04:54.801 --> 04:57.201
Joel T. Belmont Award

04:57.202 --> 04:58.302
Me

05:00.803 --> 05:07.403
The firm has purchased a half dozen tables at the 
awards banquet attendance and applause is mandatory

05:09.004 --> 05:09.704
Sir?

05:09.705 --> 05:10.505
What's this?

05:10.506 --> 05:14.906
I'm listening to Jordan Wethersby accept the last six Belmonts

05:14.907 --> 05:18.307
I've had occasion to draft down a few stray musings of my own

05:18.308 --> 05:21.608
And I'd be most grateful if you two pulled your literary talents and

05:21.609 --> 05:24.809
Type them up into a puff-o acceptance speech

05:24.810 --> 05:26.910
Feel free to be brilliant

05:30.611 --> 05:33.811
I think I speak for us all when I say how happy we are that Mr. Dowd

05:33.812 --> 05:36.612
Has returned to our somewhat empty nest

05:36.613 --> 05:38.513
Thank you sir.  It's good to be back

05:38.514 --> 05:42.014
And I'm not alone before I left Posner 
and Klein I drove the line in the water

05:42.015 --> 05:45.415
To see if any of their clients would consider leaving with me

05:45.416 --> 05:46.316
Did any?

05:46.317 --> 05:48.817
H. C. Clemens, if you want them they're yours

05:48.818 --> 05:54.318
H. C. Clemens won a no-bid contract to build the
fort of new houses in New Orleans after Katrina

05:54.319 --> 05:56.319
Exactly how many of those houses did they end up building?

05:56.320 --> 05:59.520
They're board isn't exactly made up of saints 
Keith, show me the company whose is

05:59.521 --> 06:02.521
I don't see how this firm, which is dedicated to foster social justice

06:02.522 --> 06:06.022
Can represent a company that got rich not helping victims of a natural disaster

06:06.023 --> 06:08.923
This isn't about clear consciences, it's about clear checks

06:08.924 --> 06:11.024
I thought you guys were having trouble keeping the lights on

06:11.025 --> 06:12.425
I think we should consider it

06:12.426 --> 06:16.026
H.C. Clemens is a fortune 500 hundred company with profits into billions

06:16.027 --> 06:19.627
Which doesn't exactly live up to the reputation we've been cultivating

06:19.628 --> 06:20.428
I won't represent them

06:20.429 --> 06:22.329
This minute walk from me

06:22.330 --> 06:26.730
And we're all right behind you if this firm doesn't
begin taking cases that end in getting paid

06:26.731 --> 06:29.931
H.C. Clemens currently has the legal representation it deserves

06:29.932 --> 06:30.332
Jordan

06:30.333 --> 06:36.233
And in any case I've already been retained by
a new client who requires our attention

06:36.234 --> 06:37.034
Who?

06:37.035 --> 06:39.635
A gentleman in his middle years who lost his job

06:39.636 --> 06:41.436
Due to corporate greed

06:41.437 --> 06:44.337
As a general rule midlife crisis don't make a lot of money

06:46.138 --> 06:48.338
But what's money compared to a good cause?

06:48.339 --> 06:50.739
Are you sure about this?

06:50.740 --> 06:52.340
I'm aware of the firm's plight Eli

06:52.341 --> 06:57.841
But we began this endeavor of ours with a clear idea of the
kind of cases we wanted to be associated with

06:57.842 --> 07:02.242
This suit against Everton is about basing right and wrong

07:02.243 --> 07:07.343
If it is to be our last crusade then let that
case be something we can all believe in

07:07.344 --> 07:11.944
To end otherwise, would not be to complete our quest with grace

07:13.845 --> 07:16.645
Should I take the look on your face to mean you don't agree?

07:16.646 --> 07:21.646
Not at all... I just... You said grace.  Made me think of Grace

07:21.647 --> 07:23.847
Ah, the would-be love of your life

07:24.548 --> 07:25.948
Patty gossips

07:26.749 --> 07:28.749
So she's in Africa?

07:28.750 --> 07:29.950
Kenya

07:29.951 --> 07:36.151
Uh, looking on the bright side should our firm
close its doors you'll have the time to visit her

07:39.952 --> 07:43.652
Welcome aboard Keystar Airlines flight 212 out of San Francisco

07:43.653 --> 07:49.753
We stoppped in New York and Rome before 
continuing on to our final destination: Nairobi

07:49.754 --> 07:51.554
Nairobi

07:53.555 --> 07:57.355
This plane is going... to Kenya

07:57.356 --> 08:03.556
As I said, your plane to Kenya doesn't
take off until after our firm crashes and burns

08:18.257 --> 08:21.757
Everton Financial fired my client on fraudulent grounds

08:21.758 --> 08:25.358
They claimed he had to be laid off because
they couldn't afford his salary

08:25.359 --> 08:34.159
And yet somehow found enough money to pay its disgraced 
ex-CEO Clayton Wells a 43 million dollar golden parachute

08:34.159 --> 08:35.559
It wasn't a golden parachute

08:35.561 --> 08:39.760
True.  At 43 million it was more like a... diamond incrusted parachute

08:39.761 --> 08:41.361
It was a severance package

08:41.363 --> 08:44.063
Which was paid to Mr. Wells after he was fired himself

08:44.063 --> 08:47.364
It was his budged management that
necessitated the layouts in the first place

08:47.365 --> 08:52.765
And you don't find it perverse that after
being paid 220 million to do a bad job

08:52.766 --> 08:55.966
He got rewarded with a 43 million dollar bonus?

08:55.967 --> 08:57.167
It doesn't matter what I think

08:57.168 --> 09:01.368
There's zero basis in California statute or case law for the plaintiff's claim

09:01.369 --> 09:04.869
He's right Mr. Wethersby, your client was an at-will employee

09:04.870 --> 09:08.070
Under California law that means he could be fired at any time

09:08.071 --> 09:11.671
I'm sorry Your Honor, are you arguing opposing counsel's case?

09:11.672 --> 09:13.672
Just stating the legal facts as I see them

09:13.673 --> 09:16.773
Being a Judge and all, I do that sometimes

09:16.774 --> 09:20.374
You have failed to state a valid legal claim

09:20.375 --> 09:24.375
I hereby grant Everton's 12-B-6 motion to dismiss

09:31.176 --> 09:33.076
Mr. Lebokowski

09:36.377 --> 09:37.777
Lebokowski?

09:37.778 --> 09:39.378
That's the best name you could come up with?

09:39.379 --> 09:41.479
Frank Lebokowski is my given name

09:41.480 --> 09:44.980
Chen is my nom-de-niro

09:47.481 --> 09:49.581
Look, if you're looking to talk with a certain lawyer

09:50.882 --> 09:52.082
I can't help you Frank

09:52.083 --> 09:54.283
Actually I'm looking to talk with a certain doctor

09:55.484 --> 09:56.184
Talk about what?

09:57.685 --> 09:59.185
Ok, how long has your throat been hurting?

09:59.186 --> 10:00.886
Uh, a few days

10:03.287 --> 10:04.287
How's Eli doing?

10:04.288 --> 10:07.088
Well he was doing great when he kicked you and me out of his apartment

10:07.089 --> 10:09.389
Said he didn't want to talk to either one of us again

10:09.390 --> 10:10.690
Any fever?

10:10.691 --> 10:11.591
No

10:11.592 --> 10:14.192
You two'll work things out

10:14.193 --> 10:15.593
You're brothers

10:15.594 --> 10:20.094
Brothers with a... singular hability to piss each other off

10:20.095 --> 10:21.795
And let each other down

10:21.796 --> 10:22.996
Talk to my brother someday

10:24.797 --> 10:27.197
I know that Eli believes that somehow you were

10:27.198 --> 10:27.598
I did

10:29.699 --> 10:32.399
I'm responsible for your father's death Nate

10:33.300 --> 10:36.200
Look, I don't know about this dark truth stuff

10:36.201 --> 10:38.001
But the medical truth

10:38.002 --> 10:42.102
Is that my fathers' heart disease was a direct result of his drinking

10:42.103 --> 10:44.703
Not some voodoo acupuncture

10:44.704 --> 10:46.104
You didn't kill him Frank

10:46.105 --> 10:49.305
We all have our own truths Nathan

10:49.306 --> 10:50.806
And we have to live by them

10:50.807 --> 10:54.007
Just as we have to accept the consecuences of believing in them

10:54.008 --> 10:57.208
What is Eli gonna do without you?

10:57.209 --> 10:59.809
This is for amoxicilin

10:59.810 --> 11:03.110
Unless you wanna stick with acupuncture and eye of newt

11:03.511 --> 11:05.111
You're joking right?

11:05.112 --> 11:06.512
Why don't you do the typing?

11:06.513 --> 11:08.513
Because you type faster than I do

11:08.514 --> 11:10.614
Magnum

11:10.615 --> 11:14.515
You could take some secretarial classes as
a backup in case the law thing didn't work out

11:17.016 --> 11:21.416
The quicker we get this over with the faster
I can go back to not working with you

11:21.417 --> 11:23.717
Fair enough Magna Carta

11:23.718 --> 11:26.418
Oh, and stop giving me the cute nicknames!

11:26.419 --> 11:29.419
How would you like it if I called you... Paulie?

11:30.720 --> 11:32.720
My grandfather still calls me Paulie

11:33.721 --> 11:38.021
Phones me every Wednesday, hey Paulie
how are things going at the office?

11:38.022 --> 11:41.722
That's when he's on and off with his diabetes then he

11:44.623 --> 11:46.223
Then he calls me Paul

11:47.924 --> 11:49.124
Dekker

11:49.125 --> 11:52.325
Dowd, don't you have a sinking ship to jump on?

11:52.326 --> 11:56.326
You know Paul? I am really gonna miss
bumping into youin the men's bathroom

11:56.327 --> 11:59.127
I have never felt so superior to another lawyer

12:00.128 --> 12:03.328
Hey, how could you not tell me you were leaving?

12:03.329 --> 12:07.829
I thought you and I were, you know, co-strangers in a strange land?

12:07.830 --> 12:11.130
Who am I supposed to vent to when this place drives me crazy?

12:11.131 --> 12:15.131
You can always call or be somewhere that won't drive you crazy

12:17.132 --> 12:18.932
I can't go back Matt

12:18.933 --> 12:21.933
Because there I'll always just be Maggie

12:21.934 --> 12:24.634
Here I'm a respected attorney

12:24.635 --> 12:27.835
Yo!  Automag

12:27.836 --> 12:30.336
For the most part

12:32.837 --> 12:33.937
Jerk

12:33.938 --> 12:37.838
I'm sorry I didn't tell you about the copy of dad's journal

12:37.839 --> 12:41.339
I ment you're a jerk for being the first one
to apologize for being the bigger man

12:41.340 --> 12:44.040
I'm the taller better-looking one for sure

12:45.241 --> 12:48.241
Will you skip the hug and go straight to talking about sports?

12:48.242 --> 12:51.442
Sure, you know who else would love to talk about sports?

12:51.443 --> 12:52.443
Don't

12:52.444 --> 12:53.344
I saw Frank today

12:53.345 --> 12:54.645
We just got cool

12:54.646 --> 12:57.946
You really think I wanna hear that you've been
chilling with the man who killed our father?

12:57.947 --> 12:58.947
He didn't

12:58.948 --> 13:04.648
Besides I know how it feels to have convinced yourself over the last
ten years that you were responsible for the death of Jeremy Stone

13:04.649 --> 13:06.449
You were not responsible for his heart giving out

13:06.450 --> 13:10.150
Maybe not, but I'm not convinced that whatever
joojoo Frank did is what killed him either

13:10.151 --> 13:12.551
I am convinced that he's your friend

13:13.552 --> 13:15.252
And you need him Eli

13:15.253 --> 13:17.753
What happens the next time you have a vision?

13:17.754 --> 13:19.754
Who you're gonna call?

13:20.755 --> 13:21.955
I had a vision

13:22.356 --> 13:24.456
I was on a plane leaving town

13:24.457 --> 13:28.357
Guess we shouldn't have bothered to print up
all that Wethersby Stone stationary huh?

13:28.358 --> 13:31.758
Well I didn't realize how bad your firm was hurting

13:33.759 --> 13:35.859
But Frank's hurting too Eli

13:37.560 --> 13:39.060
What else do you need?

13:39.061 --> 13:40.361
I want dad to be alive

13:40.362 --> 13:42.062
And he took that from me

13:42.063 --> 13:43.563
From you too

13:43.564 --> 13:48.264
And if the statute of limitations hadn't passed
years ago I would sue him for guru malpractice

13:48.265 --> 13:51.465
I'm fairly sure there's no such thing as guru malpractice

13:53.066 --> 13:55.566
Executive malpractice?

13:55.567 --> 14:00.267
Yeah, people sue their doctors when they bodge a procedure,
they sue their lawyers when they bodge a case

14:00.268 --> 14:03.668
I assume they'll also be able to sue their bosses when they screw up

14:03.669 --> 14:05.369
So, what are you suggesting?

14:05.370 --> 14:08.770
We sue Clayton Wells the ex-CEO for screwing up the company

14:10.171 --> 14:14.071
Lately I've been thinking about how I'm perceived in the eyes of my piers

14:14.072 --> 14:18.972
Their estimation of me has been lowered in part
because of my association with you

14:18.973 --> 14:24.173
But it's moments like this which affirm that partnership

14:24.174 --> 14:25.474
So you're gonna call our client?

14:25.475 --> 14:28.075
No, I'm gonna call our clients

14:28.076 --> 14:35.176
I see no reason why every employee who lost their job
at Everton shouldn't avail themselves of your brilliant theory

14:35.177 --> 14:36.977
All three hunded of them

14:42.778 --> 14:44.978
First Mr. Stemple sued Everton

14:44.979 --> 14:47.979
Now he's here suing Everton's former CEO

14:47.980 --> 14:51.080
I have a few Everton shares in my 401K

14:51.081 --> 14:52.381
Should I expect a subpoena too?

14:52.382 --> 14:54.382
You didn't put three hundred people out of work

14:54.383 --> 15:00.183
There's absolutely zero precedent for ex-employees
of a company suing its ex-CEO for negligence

15:00.184 --> 15:01.784
It's innovative, I admit

15:01.785 --> 15:03.885
Maybe if Clayton Wells had been more creative himself

15:03.886 --> 15:06.586
He and my clients would still have jobs

15:06.587 --> 15:10.487
This is nothing more than a clever crowd pleaser Judge

15:10.488 --> 15:15.488
CEOs owe a fiduciary duty to their stockholders why
shouldn't they owe the same to their employees?

15:15.489 --> 15:19.789
In case you haven't noticed, Clayton Wells
was just as fired as your clients

15:19.790 --> 15:25.390
With one slight difference, Mr. Wells left Everton
with a 43 million dollar consolation prize

15:25.391 --> 15:32.691
Though I am loath to accept it, the plaintiffs have
stated a valid if novel legal claim

15:32.692 --> 15:33.392
Your Honor

15:33.393 --> 15:38.593
I'm sorry counsel.  I am certifying the class
action lawsuit against Clayton Wells

15:38.594 --> 15:40.994
For executive malpractice

15:44.595 --> 15:45.695
It isn't fair!

15:45.696 --> 15:46.996
What isn't fair?

15:46.997 --> 15:48.497
The view from my office?

15:48.498 --> 15:50.798
Yes, pretty spectacular

15:50.799 --> 15:52.699
You can see exactly what from your cubicle?

15:52.700 --> 15:55.600
I don't have a cubicle.  I'm talking about Posner's speech

15:55.601 --> 15:57.501
What's wrong?  I think we knocked it out of the park

15:57.502 --> 15:59.302
There's not a word of mine in this

15:59.303 --> 16:00.903
What do you care?  You didn't even want to write the thing anyway

16:00.904 --> 16:04.204
Every assignment I'm given gets to my
best whether I think it deserves it or not

16:04.205 --> 16:06.805
Which is why you wrote your own draft, huh?

16:06.806 --> 16:11.106
I did. But unlike you I actually included some of your material

16:11.107 --> 16:12.307
Priest-rabbi lawyer joke?

16:12.308 --> 16:13.608
Couldn't have to lead it that faster

16:14.909 --> 16:20.309
While I greatly respect your previously hidden capacity for one ups manship

16:20.310 --> 16:23.310
This is not a creative writing seminar Maggie Muffin

16:23.311 --> 16:25.611
This is a lawfirm and I am a partner

16:25.612 --> 16:28.212
With a very funny priest-rabbi lawyer joke

16:28.213 --> 16:30.013
And vito power

16:30.014 --> 16:32.614
You know what?  Posner should use your speech

16:32.615 --> 16:36.815
I'm sure he'd rather be reading a speech
written by his very own mini-me

16:36.816 --> 16:41.516
Are you sure what's going on here isn't that you'd rather
be writing the speech for Jordan Wethersby?

16:41.517 --> 16:44.817
What I'd rather be doing Paul, is practicing law

16:44.818 --> 16:47.918
A job I was actually hired for at this firm

16:47.919 --> 16:50.219
Not the job you mistakenly think I have

16:50.220 --> 16:55.120
Being a subordinate for you to kick around just so
you can feel better about your own empty life

17:00.821 --> 17:02.021
What went wrong?

17:02.022 --> 17:03.422
We made some bad bets

17:03.423 --> 17:06.323
Expanded in the markets maybe we should have stayed out of

17:06.324 --> 17:09.624
I made investments in R and D that didn't pay off

17:09.625 --> 17:13.325
The plaintiffs say you're guilty of executive malpractice

17:13.326 --> 17:17.226
That you should be held to the
same standard of care as doctors

17:17.227 --> 17:18.027
Do you agree?

17:18.028 --> 17:21.428
No, doctors operate in sterile predictible environments

17:21.429 --> 17:27.329
Running a diversified multinational conglomerate is like
waking up every morning and try to drink from a firehose

17:27.329 --> 17:28.730
What about lawyers?

17:28.731 --> 17:34.431
Should you be held to the same standard
of legal liability as say me

17:34.432 --> 17:38.632
Well no because when those good people in the
jury box come back with a verdict this trial's over

17:38.633 --> 17:42.633
As far as my stewart ship at Everton goes well, jury's still out

17:42.634 --> 17:44.034
Could you elaborate?

17:44.035 --> 17:47.635
Well I'm still damn bullish that my decisions are gonna pay off

17:47.636 --> 17:51.636
I'd give anything to still be CEO of Everton 
and to steer than company into port

17:51.637 --> 17:52.737
Thank you

17:56.738 --> 17:58.438
So basically

17:59.339 --> 18:01.439
You didn't get fired because you made bad decisions

18:01.440 --> 18:03.940
Everton's Board made a bad decision when they fired you

18:03.941 --> 18:06.341
The Board wanted to mollify panicky stockholders

18:06.342 --> 18:08.442
They took the short term view

18:08.443 --> 18:10.343
I was focused on the big picture

18:10.344 --> 18:15.944
This are uh... printouts of emails sent to you by Russell Covey

18:15.945 --> 18:19.145
Everton's Chief Financial Officer when you were CEO

18:19.146 --> 18:21.746
Could you please describe the contents of those emails to the Jury?

18:21.747 --> 18:23.447
I'd have to re-read them first

18:23.448 --> 18:29.848
Or read them at all.  According to Everton's IT department
you deleted these emails and many others

18:29.849 --> 18:31.549
Without reading them

18:33.050 --> 18:36.450
Financial shortfall expected.  Your attention required

18:36.451 --> 18:38.351
Followed days later by

18:38.352 --> 18:42.452
Please call ASAP read financial shortfall

18:42.453 --> 18:47.553
Followed just a week later by Urgent,
do not delete, that's in all-caps by the way

18:47.554 --> 18:51.054
Your immediate action necessary.  Re-merger integration problems

18:51.055 --> 18:52.655
I'm sensing a pattern here

18:52.656 --> 18:54.756
Well I was too busy doing my job to be reading emails

18:56.357 --> 18:59.457
You recognize this document?

19:03.458 --> 19:06.358
It's a snapshot of my virtual Duffer.com homepage

19:06.359 --> 19:10.959
It's a website that golfers use to track their handicap, you
enter your score after each round you play and

19:10.960 --> 19:15.560
Would you care to tell the jury how many rounds
of golf you played while you were CEO?

19:15.561 --> 19:18.261
Uh, I closed a lot of key deals on that golf course

19:18.262 --> 19:19.362
Really, uh... name one

19:21.063 --> 19:25.763
I forgot, you don't deal in specifics you're a big picture guy

19:31.864 --> 19:33.164
Give me your wallet

19:33.165 --> 19:35.565
If you're gonna hold up people you work with you
should probably go with a ski mask

19:35.566 --> 19:36.666
And a gun!

19:36.667 --> 19:38.667
You told me to take care of Jim Norris

19:38.668 --> 19:41.068
He doesn't like the soap in the men's room

19:41.069 --> 19:43.369
He wants hypoallergenic soap

19:43.370 --> 19:46.770
Also known as white-people-can't-do-anything-the-easy-way soap

19:46.771 --> 19:51.171
And since our firm cannot afford a petty cash draw anymore

19:51.172 --> 19:53.672
OK, but after you've done this do me a favor

19:53.673 --> 19:56.673
Find out how much the flights are
from San Francisco to Kenya

19:56.674 --> 19:57.874
Planning a trip?

19:57.875 --> 19:58.875
No

19:58.876 --> 20:01.876
Well, I don't know, I just need to know how much it would cost

20:01.877 --> 20:03.577
It'll cost you your assistant

20:03.578 --> 20:04.278
What?

20:04.279 --> 20:09.879
This place is hanging on by thread Eli, now is not
the time to go gazelle hurting with Grace

20:09.880 --> 20:12.980
Well the vision I got sent by the notorious GOD says otherwise

20:12.981 --> 20:14.381
What did you see this time?

20:14.382 --> 20:16.682
That we're all about to get a never ending supplied vacation days

20:16.683 --> 20:18.383
Maybe you made the wrong interpretation

20:18.384 --> 20:20.684
Why don't you let me make an appointment with Dr. Chen?

20:20.685 --> 20:23.885
I don't need Chen! I just... I need to know about the ticket

20:25.186 --> 20:26.686
I thought things were going well

20:26.687 --> 20:28.487
Eli said he scored some points today

20:28.488 --> 20:29.388
So he did

20:29.389 --> 20:31.489
Then why do you look like you've already lost?

20:31.490 --> 20:36.290
I'm stressful enough to represent a man I consider my path not taken

20:36.291 --> 20:41.391
And now having the responsibility of representing three hundred of them?

20:41.392 --> 20:42.992
You should be three hundred times more proud of yourself

20:42.993 --> 20:44.893
I know I am

20:44.894 --> 20:48.694
It wasn't so long ago that I would've been defending the ruthless CEO

20:48.695 --> 20:51.795
Ironically back then I slept soundly

20:51.796 --> 20:56.396
At least there we know such anxiety
associated with tonight's award's dinner

20:56.397 --> 20:58.097
You don't know you won't win the Belmont

20:58.098 --> 21:03.198
In fact I do. My opposing counsel in the Wells case
is also in the nominating committee

21:03.199 --> 21:05.999
Doug, do we have an appointment scheduled?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.300
You don't know?

21:07.301 --> 21:08.001
Know what?

21:09.102 --> 21:11.802
Hello!  Have you heard the latest about Everton, folks?

21:11.803 --> 21:16.603
Lovely Everton, our sources in the boardroom tell us that Everton Financial

21:16.604 --> 21:23.204
Is in final stage talks to rehire Clayton Wells as its CEO

21:23.205 --> 21:25.405
Boo, boo, boo, boom... what?

21:25.406 --> 21:27.606
Can't believe it?  Believe it!

21:27.607 --> 21:30.207
Take it to the bank and... smoke it!

21:30.208 --> 21:32.508
They are going to give the...

21:32.509 --> 21:33.309
Can they do that?

21:33.310 --> 21:34.610
Just hire him back?

21:34.611 --> 21:35.511
Yes

21:35.512 --> 21:38.112
But why in the world would they want to?

21:38.113 --> 21:40.013
That's why, ENF

21:40.014 --> 21:44.914
The continued media coverage of the trial has cost
Everton's stockprice to further reroad

21:44.915 --> 21:47.615
So they think that if they rehire Wells their stock will go back up?

21:47.616 --> 21:51.016
Obviously but that's not our problem

21:51.017 --> 21:55.917
If Everton is willing to rehire Wells then how
negligent could he have been in the first place?

21:59.418 --> 22:03.118
I want you to try and get as much of your
homework done as you can on the plane

22:03.119 --> 22:05.019
What?

22:05.020 --> 22:07.420
You don't wanna take my name?

22:07.421 --> 22:10.121
People know me professionally by my maiden name

22:10.122 --> 22:11.922
And I like it

22:11.923 --> 22:15.623
It would've been nice if you would've told me that before the wedding

22:15.624 --> 22:18.224
What the hell were the republicans thinking?

22:18.225 --> 22:22.725
Did anyone honestly think that Crotch the old
Vetrin could be Mr. Young Hip and Cool?

22:22.726 --> 22:25.426
I guess experience doesn't count for much these days

22:25.427 --> 22:27.127
Not against their rockstar

22:31.128 --> 22:33.528
This isn't my future it's the past

22:33.529 --> 22:35.729
Sir, can I help you find your seat?

22:35.730 --> 22:38.230
What?  No, no I'm OK

22:40.431 --> 22:41.831
Dad

22:42.732 --> 22:44.332
It's kind of ironic

22:44.333 --> 22:49.933
We never get dad to show up for ball games or 
school play, parents-teacher conferences

22:49.934 --> 22:51.834
Now he's a serious regular in my visions

22:51.835 --> 22:54.035
This one was from about a decade ago

22:54.036 --> 22:56.536
Do you remember him taking a trip abut that time?

22:56.537 --> 22:59.137
No.  But even if I did he wouldn't have flown

22:59.938 --> 23:03.738
Dad hated flying!  Why do you think we roadtripped for all our family vacations

23:03.739 --> 23:05.439
I still don't know what he was doing in that plane

23:05.440 --> 23:08.940
Well, there is one way to find out

23:11.441 --> 23:16.541
Come on Eli, don't you think now might be a 
good time to bury the acupuncture needle?

23:16.542 --> 23:18.142
We don't need Frank, we need google

23:20.243 --> 23:23.643
I saw the carrier name and the flight number

23:23.644 --> 23:26.944
Keystar Airlines, flight 212

23:26.945 --> 23:29.445
See if there's anything weird-ish

23:29.446 --> 23:31.446
Or daddy-ish

23:33.047 --> 23:37.747
Woah, that plane uh... Yeah but dad...

23:37.748 --> 23:38.948
He couldn't have been on it!

23:38.949 --> 23:39.849
What do you think it means?

23:40.850 --> 23:42.950
Motion for summary judgement

23:42.951 --> 23:45.751
Now that my client has his job back this case is over

23:45.752 --> 23:47.752
The Jury reached a verdict? Did we win?

23:47.753 --> 23:49.153
No, you lost

23:49.154 --> 23:52.354
Hope you guys have a plan B

23:52.355 --> 23:54.155
I'm thinking of killing the judge

23:54.156 --> 23:58.156
Let's leave that for a plan further down the alphabet.
Judge Bortz's wife would miss him terribly

23:58.157 --> 24:01.757
Lucky girl getting to trade in the maiden name and become Mrs. Bortz

24:01.758 --> 24:03.158
All rise!

24:05.459 --> 24:08.359
It would've been nice if you'd told me this before the wedding

24:08.360 --> 24:09.060
What are you talking about?

24:09.061 --> 24:11.761
Sir can I see the list of Everton shareholders?

24:13.962 --> 24:15.962
Counsel, I haven't got all day

24:20.163 --> 24:23.363
Alright, the defense has apparently made a motion for summary judgement

24:23.364 --> 24:24.964
Based on irrelevant development Your Honor

24:24.965 --> 24:29.065
To use your dying patient analogy, the patient has hired back his doctor

24:29.066 --> 24:35.566
This entire case is premised on Clayton Wells's termination, that
termination has been rescinded therefore the case must be dismissed

24:36.867 --> 24:38.267
You can't do that

24:38.268 --> 24:39.668
Actually I can

24:39.669 --> 24:46.869
Watch as I slowly raise the gavel and say motion granted, case dismissed

24:47.870 --> 24:49.670
Are you entirely out of your mind?

24:52.171 --> 24:56.571
The fact that Everton's Board wants to rehire Clayton Wells is irrelevant

24:56.572 --> 24:59.972
This case is not about Everton's Board, it's about its employees

24:59.973 --> 25:01.173
It's shareholders

25:01.174 --> 25:01.674
Enough Mr. Stone

25:01.675 --> 25:03.175
Even their spouses

25:03.176 --> 25:09.176
I think that you are just a Judge to take
us on our maiden name... I mean, voyage

25:09.177 --> 25:14.477
You uh, raise an excellent point

25:14.478 --> 25:15.878
Mr. Stone

25:17.079 --> 25:19.179
On further reflexion

25:20.680 --> 25:28.580
Everton's decision to rehire Clayton Wells should not preclude
the Jury from rendering judgement on its previous teniored ex-CEO

25:28.581 --> 25:31.181
Motion for summary judgement denied

25:35.182 --> 25:38.782
Did you just blackmailed the Judge?  Not that I'm complaining

25:38.783 --> 25:45.083
Something you said reminded me that Brenda Hudson owns
75 hundred shares of Everton's stock in her retirement folder

25:45.084 --> 25:46.084
Who's Brenda Hudson?

25:46.085 --> 25:48.185
Brenda Bortz, actually

25:48.186 --> 25:49.986
Hudson was her maiden name

25:49.987 --> 25:52.587
Judge Bortz has his retirement to worry about

25:57.288 --> 25:59.988
And now for the moment you've all been waiting for

25:59.989 --> 26:09.589
The Joel T. Belmont Award for Excellence in Jurisprudence is the highest
honor the California Bar Association can bestow on one of its colleagues

26:09.590 --> 26:17.590
It is my distinguished pleasure to present the 
2009 Joel T. Belmont Award to Martin Posner

26:28.291 --> 26:31.191
Thank you New York, thank you very, very much

26:31.192 --> 26:34.892
Thank you all ladies and gentlemen of the jury

26:34.893 --> 26:41.293
An obscure 19th century american lawyer you may or may not have heard of

26:41.294 --> 26:43.894
Abraham Lincoln said I quote:

26:43.895 --> 26:50.495
The leading rule for the lawyer is to leave nothing
for tomorrow which can be done today

26:50.496 --> 26:56.296
Lincoln's challenge to his fellow attorneys hopes its
true now as it did a century and a half ago

26:57.597 --> 26:58.697
Wine please

27:03.698 --> 27:05.398
Nice job with the speech

27:05.399 --> 27:07.699
How did you know it wasn't Posner's terms?

27:07.700 --> 27:10.400
Nothing says Maggie Dekker more than an obscure historical quote

27:10.401 --> 27:12.301
You'll be interested to know I only co-wrote it

27:12.302 --> 27:14.002
Paul Rollins?

27:14.003 --> 27:16.103
How did you know?

27:16.104 --> 27:17.004
Just a lucky guess

27:17.005 --> 27:19.505
I know you two are spending some time together

27:19.506 --> 27:21.706
Did you have a vision about me?

27:21.707 --> 27:22.807
About me and Paul?

27:22.808 --> 27:26.608
Let's just say I... I saw you together

27:26.609 --> 27:28.209
I know it's none of my business

27:28.210 --> 27:29.610
No kidding

27:29.611 --> 27:30.911
So there is something going on with you two?

27:30.912 --> 27:32.912
You know when I said last week that we were friends?

27:32.913 --> 27:36.713
I didn't mean the kind of friends who
could have this kind of conversation

27:44.814 --> 27:48.414
Martin.  Congratulations. It's a well-deserved honor

27:48.415 --> 27:53.615
Well I have to confess it's a bit a surprise.  I wouldn't
have expected you to be the better man

27:53.616 --> 27:56.416
Well that would explain our parting of professional ways

27:56.417 --> 28:02.417
Excuse me, before we wind things up tonight we
have one more colleague to hear from

28:02.418 --> 28:04.018
Taylor Wethersby

28:12.819 --> 28:14.519
Good evening

28:14.520 --> 28:22.320
This year the California Bar Association is introducing a
new accolade to recognize commitment to the legal system

28:22.321 --> 28:26.421
Beyond the collection of courtroom and boardroom victories

28:26.422 --> 28:29.722
And while most of us are just trying to find our
way in this world as lawyers

28:29.723 --> 28:32.923
There are very few of us who use the law

28:32.924 --> 28:34.524
To make the world better

28:34.525 --> 28:41.025
And so it is with great pride that I've been asked to
present the first annual Ackerman Humanitarian Award

28:41.026 --> 28:43.126
To Jordan Wethersby

29:11.627 --> 29:14.727
Wow.  You really do have your own office

29:14.728 --> 29:17.228
And I have an actual law degree to go with it

29:20.129 --> 29:22.329
Thought Posner gave a pretty good speech here tonight

29:22.330 --> 29:24.630
I thought so too, since I wrote it

29:24.631 --> 29:26.631
Yeah, no need to thank me for what I did by the way

29:26.632 --> 29:28.432
What do you need Paul?

29:28.433 --> 29:32.833
I... I minored in theater in undergrad

29:32.834 --> 29:35.034
So you would've done a better job delivering the speech?

29:36.935 --> 29:40.235
The Paul Rollins you work for is a part I play

29:40.236 --> 29:42.036
It's a... it's a character

29:42.037 --> 29:45.137
And truth be told the other lawyers in this firm are the same way

29:45.138 --> 29:46.238
They're playing roles

29:46.239 --> 29:51.739
So that when their... their alteregos 
cut corners or reach ethical boundaries

29:51.740 --> 29:54.740
Or speak inapropriately to highly talented subordinates

29:56.141 --> 29:57.941
It doesn't feel like bad behavior

29:57.942 --> 30:00.042
Because they're not really doing it

30:01.843 --> 30:05.643
This is the weirdest apology ever

30:05.644 --> 30:11.844
OK my point is... in spite of my considerable 
intelligence it's taken me a while to see that

30:12.545 --> 30:15.245
In the production known as Posner Klein

30:16.446 --> 30:18.946
The part of Maggie Dekker is being played by herself

30:20.447 --> 30:22.947
Why are you telling me this Paul?

30:23.948 --> 30:29.048
Because I suspect that you're a pretty good judge of character

30:31.249 --> 30:39.849
This week, I suddenly found myself wanting you not to judge me

30:39.850 --> 30:42.150
Without all the facts

30:48.551 --> 30:49.751
I'll see you

30:49.752 --> 30:52.152
Maggie

31:00.953 --> 31:02.553
Eli Stone is a clever lawyer

31:04.354 --> 31:06.954
Mainstreet is furious

31:06.955 --> 31:09.955
With lawstreet lately and for a very good reason

31:09.956 --> 31:12.856
People are loosing their jobs

31:12.857 --> 31:21.157
While the heads of these corporations continue to 
collect 7 and 8 figure bonuses and golden parachutes

31:21.158 --> 31:26.358
It's a patent unfairness that the plaintiffs are hoping
they can convert into a financial windfall

31:26.359 --> 31:29.959
And it all seems so perfectly reasonable doesn't it?

31:35.361 --> 31:38.161
Well, have you been to a doctor lately?

31:38.162 --> 31:41.862
The high prices, the needless tests

31:41.863 --> 31:43.363
The bureaucracy

31:43.364 --> 31:47.064
That's all to shield them from lawsuits

31:47.065 --> 31:52.565
And now they want corporate executives to 
be subject to the same second guessing

31:52.566 --> 31:58.066
Do you know what that will do to America's 
ability to compete in the global market place?

31:58.067 --> 32:00.867
If you take away the golden parachute

32:00.868 --> 32:10.168
How will we attract qualified men and women to 
run these corporations that give us our jobs

32:11.169 --> 32:18.069
Mr. Stemple and his co-workers they lost their jobs and that is
a tragedy, one that happens far to often these days

32:20.270 --> 32:22.070
But to give them what they're asking for

32:22.071 --> 32:24.571
Could cost you your job

32:30.572 --> 32:33.672
Ms. Miller's argument has a familiar ring to it

32:34.873 --> 32:39.673
CEOs have to make billings because without 
them there are no jobs for the rest of us

32:39.674 --> 32:41.274
Greed is good

32:41.275 --> 32:45.775
Rising tide lifts all boats, prosperity trickles down

32:45.776 --> 32:49.076
Don't tie our hands with regulation

32:50.277 --> 32:52.377
Well, you've seen how that worked out

32:52.378 --> 32:56.978
Doug Stemple and his co-workers didn't loose their jobs

32:56.979 --> 33:00.179
Clayton Wells lost their jobs for them

33:00.180 --> 33:03.680
And not because anyone second guessed him or tied his hands

33:03.681 --> 33:08.081
He ran Everton into the ground then ran away with a golden parachute

33:09.682 --> 33:13.082
But Ms. Miller is right about one thing

33:13.083 --> 33:18.383
The vast majority of us depend on CEOs like Clayon Wells for our livelihoods

33:18.384 --> 33:25.984
So why shouldn't the law hold them to the same standard of care as doctors

33:25.985 --> 33:29.985
And stock brokers as accountants and attorneys

33:29.986 --> 33:35.586
Why shouldn't they be held to the same standard of basic competency

33:36.787 --> 33:38.687
That you're held to

33:38.688 --> 33:40.688
In your job

33:48.489 --> 33:51.189
Ladies and gentleman this is your captain speaking

33:51.190 --> 33:55.290
We're on a bit of a delay here but we should be 
cleared to push back in just a few minutes

33:55.390 --> 33:55.790
So please 

33:55.791 --> 33:56.491
Champagne sir?

33:56.492 --> 33:57.492
Sit back and relax

33:59.293 --> 34:00.893
No

34:03.094 --> 34:04.194
Champagne mam?

34:11.995 --> 34:14.895
Excuse me, everbody just stop what they're doing for a minute

34:16.196 --> 34:19.295
Please could everyone just listen for a minute

34:26.197 --> 34:27.897
This plane is going to crash

34:34.598 --> 34:37.098
I'm trying to imagine what you must be thinking

34:37.099 --> 34:42.399
Looking at me the wacked-out guy dirty wear jacket
telling you that this plane... the plane that you're on is...

34:43.900 --> 34:45.199
Gonna crash 

34:45.201 --> 34:47.301
And that your lives will end today

34:47.302 --> 34:48.502
But I saw it

34:51.402 --> 34:56.703
I saw you and you and you and you and you all

35:02.204 --> 35:05.404
Look, I need you to imagine something else

35:06.305 --> 35:10.005
Just imagine, being in your homes tonight safe

35:10.006 --> 35:16.406
Watching TV, watching news, watching story after story 

35:16.407 --> 35:18.907
About this plane going down

35:18.908 --> 35:21.108
And then imagine your friends and your family

35:21.109 --> 35:23.009
Caught in a panic

35:23.010 --> 35:26.710
And then imagine answering because you weren't on this plane

35:26.711 --> 35:32.311
Listened to the nut with the dirty jacket and you got off and you lived

35:32.312 --> 35:33.112
You lived!

35:33.113 --> 35:35.013
Sir! I need you to come with us

35:35.014 --> 35:38.414
You don't have to... you don't have to believe 
in the messenger to believe in the message

35:39.215 --> 35:40.915
Come on sir

35:42.916 --> 35:44.116
Get your stuff

35:44.117 --> 35:45.917
Are you serious?

35:45.918 --> 35:47.118
Yes, I am

35:47.119 --> 35:49.619
We are not flying on this plane

35:51.220 --> 35:52.820
Grace

35:52.821 --> 35:54.221
You're so weird

36:09.522 --> 36:11.322
Has the Jury reached a verdict?

36:11.323 --> 36:15.523
In the matter of Stemple at all versus Clayton Wells

36:15.524 --> 36:18.524
We the Jury find in favor of the plaintiffs

36:18.525 --> 36:22.725
And award damages in the amount of 300 dollars 

36:22.726 --> 36:25.826
Finding gross negligence to exist

36:25.827 --> 36:32.327
We further award punitive damages in the amount of 220 million dollars

36:45.728 --> 36:47.028
Congratulations

36:49.629 --> 36:51.329
Surprise!

36:51.330 --> 36:54.530
You've only missed our birthdays by 4 months and 8 months respectively

36:54.531 --> 36:59.831
Welcome to WS and As first we-just-won-a-gazillion-dollars-and-safe-perform firm

36:59.832 --> 37:02.832
Just say this will need to become an annual event

37:02.833 --> 37:03.733
Who are these guys?

37:03.734 --> 37:06.734
Oh, these are the movers I hired to clear out Jim Norris's office

37:06.735 --> 37:12.435
I waited a full minute after hearing the Jury 
verdict before tossing his annoying ass out the door

37:12.436 --> 37:16.336
Come on, taste these mushroom tarts.  They're divine!

37:16.337 --> 37:18.637
What if the verdict hadn't gone our way?

37:18.638 --> 37:23.138
It'll be a wake!  So long as it's not a going away party

37:23.139 --> 37:26.539
Don't worry, I kind of misinterpreted the vision

37:26.540 --> 37:28.840
Try imagine my galloping shock!

37:38.141 --> 37:39.941
You're not planning on jumping are you?

37:42.642 --> 37:47.342
It's only one story. Don't let your broken leg lift my spirits

37:47.343 --> 37:48.943
Long time no visit

37:48.944 --> 37:50.644
What brings you to Chinatown?

37:50.645 --> 37:53.145
There's a great dim sum place around the corner

37:55.546 --> 37:58.046
The first time you walked into my shop

37:58.047 --> 38:01.547
I knew one day the truth would come out about how your dad died

38:01.548 --> 38:06.548
I practiced my grand speech about how your dad 
begged me to do it and how I

38:06.549 --> 38:08.949
How was I gonna beg at you for forgiveness

38:08.950 --> 38:09.750
Frank

38:09.751 --> 38:14.751
Did you know your dad's name Jeremy was a derivation of Jeremiah?

38:16.052 --> 38:19.152
God told Jeremiah

38:19.153 --> 38:21.653
"You would go to them but they'll not listen to you"

38:23.154 --> 38:25.254
How's that for mind screw?

38:25.255 --> 38:26.855
They did listen Frank

38:26.856 --> 38:28.856
The vision that he had

38:28.857 --> 38:31.557
Why he desperately needed the dark truth

38:32.858 --> 38:34.658
He saw a plane crash

38:34.659 --> 38:37.059
People dying and...

38:37.960 --> 38:39.760
He saved them

38:39.761 --> 38:42.661
Some of them at least, uh...

38:42.662 --> 38:44.362
He convinced them to get off the plane

38:44.363 --> 38:46.963
One of those people was Grace

38:48.764 --> 38:50.464
She was on that plane

38:51.065 --> 38:53.465
He saved her too

38:56.066 --> 38:57.466
You helped save her

39:00.567 --> 39:04.967
I'm so... I'm so sorry I took your father from you Eli

39:04.968 --> 39:06.068
You didn't

39:06.069 --> 39:08.469
And it was wrong of me 

39:08.470 --> 39:10.270
To accuse you like that

39:10.271 --> 39:11.771
You had every right to be angry

39:11.772 --> 39:13.772
You're his son

39:13.773 --> 39:17.073
Yeah... well that's the thing

39:17.074 --> 39:21.474
I um... finally realized that

39:21.475 --> 39:23.675
So were you

39:25.476 --> 39:27.376
You were son in the ways that mattered

39:28.777 --> 39:32.977
When me and Nate couldn't get far 
enough away from him you were there

39:32.978 --> 39:35.578
Being what I never was

39:36.379 --> 39:37.879
He loved you Eli

39:37.880 --> 39:39.680
I know

39:39.681 --> 39:41.481
I know that

39:41.482 --> 39:44.082
But I didn't know him

39:44.083 --> 39:49.983
You know?  At least not the him not stinking of alcohol and failure

39:49.984 --> 39:55.384
But you, even for the briefest moment 
you knew him for what he could be

39:56.585 --> 39:58.585
Someone who could change the world

40:02.986 --> 40:04.586
So what I came here to say

40:04.587 --> 40:06.487
