WEBVTT

00:00.336 --> 00:02.992
- Come on! Oh!
- Yeah!

00:03.141 --> 00:05.908
She won't stick around long.
You know that, right?

00:06.063 --> 00:08.937
You're in way over your head.

00:08.986 --> 00:11.152
Come near my family and you're dead.

00:11.201 --> 00:13.039
It's kind of hard
sitting around, watching

00:13.088 --> 00:15.322
your best friend live the life
that you were supposed to have.

00:15.396 --> 00:17.648
- You want my job? Take it.
- If this is correct,

00:17.697 --> 00:19.812
Millwood Family Services is
apprehending children

00:19.861 --> 00:22.230
at twice the national average.
Your school survives

00:22.279 --> 00:24.279
off of children in the system,
yes or no?

00:24.328 --> 00:26.552
This is baby Carter.

00:26.601 --> 00:28.255
How can there be an
open case for neglect

00:28.304 --> 00:29.801
on a baby that's not even born yet?

00:29.850 --> 00:32.317
Oh, we know what kind of chief
you really are.

00:33.285 --> 00:35.585
You don't think I can handle it?
Make sure none of your officers

00:35.673 --> 00:37.481
get knocked out with a lead pipe?

00:37.542 --> 00:39.583
I just need a few
days to settle this thing

00:39.632 --> 00:40.880
with Mercer once and for all.

00:40.929 --> 00:42.611
Please, let this go!

00:42.715 --> 00:45.403
Kodie's test was administered
by Clear Dawn Labs.

00:45.452 --> 00:48.185
We did this again
with two other subjects.

00:48.278 --> 00:50.492
All false positives. All from your lab.

00:50.541 --> 00:54.043
We sue Clear Dawn Labs,
we break a chain in that system.

00:54.092 --> 00:56.759
Whatever you're feeling
right now is OK.

00:57.245 --> 00:59.538
- What?
- You're pregnant.

01:03.191 --> 01:06.458
So your blood pressure
and your heart rate are good.

01:06.565 --> 01:08.637
You've got a healthy bod
to grow this baby.

01:08.939 --> 01:10.953
How far along am I, exactly?

01:11.328 --> 01:14.004
You are roughly seven weeks,

01:14.053 --> 01:16.213
but we won't know for sure
until we do the ultrasound.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.176
OK, so...

01:18.382 --> 01:21.217
how long can a person work
in this condition?

01:22.582 --> 01:23.689
It's a pregnancy.

01:23.738 --> 01:26.797
We haven't called it a
condition since the '50s, but,

01:26.846 --> 01:28.568
it really depends.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.670
Depends on-on what?

01:30.728 --> 01:33.432
Depends on the pregnancy
and the person.

01:33.481 --> 01:36.315
There's a lot of personal,
hereditary factors.

01:36.754 --> 01:39.972
Do any of those hereditary
factors include mental illness?

01:40.168 --> 01:41.788
Yes, some.

01:43.616 --> 01:46.161
What about sociopathic tendencies?

01:47.582 --> 01:50.984
Yeah, that's just my side.
His side's...

01:51.056 --> 01:53.623
riddled with mental illness,
garden-variety addiction,

01:54.027 --> 01:55.379
so...

01:56.638 --> 01:57.887
we're pretty much screwed, right?

01:57.936 --> 02:00.870
No... no, I wouldn't say that.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.704
When is my next appointment?

02:05.753 --> 02:07.071
I can have my receptionist

02:07.120 --> 02:09.354
book your 10-week ultrasound.

02:09.533 --> 02:12.314
I will have this much more
under control by then.

02:12.456 --> 02:14.323
Well, good luck with that.

02:14.711 --> 02:16.230
It's been my experience

02:16.279 --> 02:18.679
that pregnancy is the last thing
anyone can control.

02:20.297 --> 02:22.799
Doctor, I just have one more question.

02:23.114 --> 02:24.696
OK.

02:25.503 --> 02:28.370
Do you thing that I should
proceed with this pregnancy?

02:28.785 --> 02:31.620
Well... what do you want?

02:37.093 --> 02:38.835
I wanna get back to work.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:09.891 --> 03:11.792
Joanna!

03:24.263 --> 03:25.412
Mr. Feldman?

03:25.461 --> 03:26.873
Oh, thank you for calling me back.

03:26.922 --> 03:29.561
I just wanted to talk to you
about your role at Clear Dawn.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.713
Uh-huh.

03:34.278 --> 03:36.139
Yeah, no, that's-I-I understand.

03:36.188 --> 03:37.539
Thank you for taking...

03:38.998 --> 03:40.147
Let me guess,

03:40.196 --> 03:41.647
another Clear Dawn board member

03:41.696 --> 03:43.074
told you to go screw yourself?

03:43.123 --> 03:45.771
Not in those words... exactly.

03:45.820 --> 03:47.653
That's three strikes in a row.

03:49.435 --> 03:50.807
Don't give up, Crawford.

03:50.856 --> 03:53.177
We never thought that finding
a whistleblower would be easy.

03:53.331 --> 03:55.037
Maybe the board is not
the right place to look.

03:55.086 --> 03:56.678
They're all toeing the company line.

03:56.727 --> 03:58.225
What about former board members?

03:58.274 --> 04:00.349
Yeah, Luna and Cat are
looking into a lead.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.381
Clear Dawn Labs,

04:02.430 --> 04:04.838
processed 700 tests last year,

04:04.887 --> 04:06.014
and we know that at least

04:06.063 --> 04:07.304
three of those were false positives.

04:07.352 --> 04:09.623
Someone else knows more.

04:09.820 --> 04:12.687
Maybe we're going about this
the wrong way.

04:14.197 --> 04:15.537
700 tests, Joanna...

04:15.586 --> 04:19.076
No, this case is too
complicated for a class action.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.825
- With Kodie alone we're just...
- Just leave it, please.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.912
OK.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.811
You wanna talk about the other
thing we're working on?

04:30.327 --> 04:31.748
How was the appointment?

04:32.493 --> 04:34.279
I'd rather talk about the class action.

04:34.328 --> 04:36.490
Look, I really would've liked
to have been there.

04:36.914 --> 04:38.821
I told you, I just...

04:39.108 --> 04:40.727
I need some time on my own with this.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.904
Joanna, you can't just spring
something like this on me

04:42.953 --> 04:44.326
and then shut me out.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.689
It's Luna. Hey, what's up?

04:50.739 --> 04:52.606
Can we add Callie Sparrow to the class?

04:52.655 --> 04:55.591
No, because we are not
certifying as a class.

04:55.644 --> 04:58.111
OK. Well, then can we at least
take her on as a client?

04:58.179 --> 04:59.664
Sorry, we don't have the bandwidth.

04:59.713 --> 05:02.724
But Joanna, she needs
our help. A lot of people do.

05:02.773 --> 05:05.107
Luna, you know what is
involved in a class.

05:05.156 --> 05:06.907
We cannot do this.

05:07.211 --> 05:09.365
Joanna? Hey. Cat here.

05:09.506 --> 05:11.287
What if I took the lead on Callie?

05:11.336 --> 05:13.240
- I'm ready.
- No, you're not.

05:13.351 --> 05:14.689
Any luck with the board members?

05:14.746 --> 05:17.742
- Not yet.
- OK. Well, keep digging.

05:20.615 --> 05:22.729
Hey. Hey!

05:23.091 --> 05:25.025
Slow down! Hey!

05:25.347 --> 05:27.447
She's giving us more grunt work.

05:27.545 --> 05:29.443
Yeah! Because if you haven't noticed,

05:29.492 --> 05:30.553
we're the grunts, babe.

05:30.602 --> 05:32.272
I know, but I'm worried about Callie.

05:32.321 --> 05:34.036
They're going to take her baby.

05:34.085 --> 05:35.576
Not if you stop them.

05:35.632 --> 05:37.873
If Callie makes Kodie's case stronger,

05:37.922 --> 05:39.146
Joanna can't object.

05:39.201 --> 05:42.355
So you're saying we can take
her on if I can figure out how?

05:42.614 --> 05:44.357
You're a quick study, grunt.

05:44.545 --> 05:46.496
What about hunting
former board members?

05:46.545 --> 05:48.295
- I got your back.
- Thank you.

05:48.363 --> 05:49.941
You'll owe me one.

05:50.256 --> 05:52.648
Now go, make a good case for Callie.

05:59.350 --> 06:01.170
Everyone sees the upside on this.

06:01.412 --> 06:02.552
I also see the very

06:02.601 --> 06:03.802
steep downside.

06:03.850 --> 06:05.944
Why don't you?

06:07.459 --> 06:08.682
That might be important.

06:08.787 --> 06:11.051
It's not. It's my father.

06:11.528 --> 06:13.466
Hey, speaking of fatherhood...

06:14.297 --> 06:16.964
Look, I just wanna know
how I can support you on this.

06:21.316 --> 06:23.650
- Joanna Chang.
- It's like you plan these.

06:23.948 --> 06:25.525
Yeah, I know the place. I'll be there.

06:26.122 --> 06:28.589
It was Clear Dawn Labs.
They wanna talk.

06:30.904 --> 06:33.193
Your lawsuit is off the mark.
Your facts are wrong.

06:33.242 --> 06:35.037
That's for a jury to decide.

06:35.086 --> 06:37.631
Look, Clear Dawn Labs is not
some evil enterprise.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.912
They're a nationally respected
medical facility.

06:39.961 --> 06:41.428
We're not pulling our complaint.

06:41.477 --> 06:43.631
I'm considering lava cake for dessert.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.560
And a countersuit for defamation.

06:46.099 --> 06:47.807
My client has nothing to take.

06:47.856 --> 06:49.483
Maybe we'll sue you...

06:49.532 --> 06:50.818
Personally.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.893
That would be a bad idea.

06:55.177 --> 06:58.185
Clear Dawn Labs would like
to offer your client 25K.

06:59.047 --> 07:01.709
- A settlement?
- No admission of fault.

07:02.031 --> 07:03.441
In exchange, we require

07:03.490 --> 07:05.405
your client's legal agreement
not to speak publicly

07:05.454 --> 07:07.621
about the case or pursue
any further legal action.

07:07.952 --> 07:10.662
My client has suffered significant

07:10.711 --> 07:12.513
emotional trauma.

07:12.767 --> 07:14.601
She wants her children back.

07:14.904 --> 07:16.560
My client doesn't have her children.

07:16.615 --> 07:18.803
No, but your client's faulty drug test

07:18.852 --> 07:20.513
is the reason for their apprehension.

07:20.589 --> 07:22.187
50000.

07:22.990 --> 07:24.347
This isn't about the money.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.045
It's always about the money.

07:27.724 --> 07:29.443
We reject your offer.

07:29.646 --> 07:32.373
You're obligated to relay all
settlement offers to your client.

08:03.998 --> 08:06.032
- Gord.
- Boss.

08:06.332 --> 08:08.521
Got the haul from the Fisher bust?

08:08.570 --> 08:10.065
It's my first.

08:10.114 --> 08:12.038
Never held a pound of cocaine before.

08:12.146 --> 08:15.666
Yeah. The Crown asked me to,
uh, bring it to them first.

08:15.715 --> 08:16.861
They, uh...

08:16.910 --> 08:19.275
need to take some photos
for the show cause hearing.

08:20.251 --> 08:22.234
Aren't they supposed to make
a formal request for that?

08:22.283 --> 08:24.291
Ah, there's always
exceptions to the rule.

08:24.384 --> 08:27.185
This is one of them. Ahem.

08:29.353 --> 08:30.704
Whatever you say.

08:30.753 --> 08:32.558
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry.

08:32.607 --> 08:34.212
I won't tell the chief.

08:37.307 --> 08:38.712
Ahem.

09:38.443 --> 09:39.889
Taylor.

09:40.509 --> 09:42.327
I didn't have anywhere else to go.

09:42.376 --> 09:44.312
Come in.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.780
I can't fall asleep
and when I finally do,

09:49.838 --> 09:51.944
I-I can't get up out of bed.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.694
Sounds like you're depressed.

09:53.743 --> 09:55.515
Have you been to see a doctor?

09:55.866 --> 09:57.897
No. I don't know what to do.

09:57.946 --> 09:59.936
What about Luna?

09:59.985 --> 10:01.991
Well, she's busy, she's working.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.741
She hasn't really been around much.

10:03.790 --> 10:05.719
Oh, sweetie.

10:06.211 --> 10:08.364
You always told me I could do anything.

10:08.413 --> 10:10.190
You can do anything.

10:10.266 --> 10:12.559
Whenever I try, it goes wrong.

10:13.194 --> 10:14.358
Miss Evans...

10:14.415 --> 10:15.758
What is it, Taylor?

10:15.831 --> 10:17.427
You can tell me.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.380
- I did something stupid.
- OK.

10:22.429 --> 10:24.996
Well, if you're in trouble,
we can help you, but...

10:25.045 --> 10:27.045
I need to know.

10:27.272 --> 10:28.976
So, um, there's this guy.

10:29.025 --> 10:30.275
He used to work for my dad.

10:30.324 --> 10:31.757
He's a piece of crap.

10:31.806 --> 10:33.158
And I wanted to bring him down.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.791
Did he hurt you?

10:35.467 --> 10:37.678
Just really scared me.

10:37.822 --> 10:39.648
I don't know why I couldn't let it go,

10:39.697 --> 10:41.287
and now I really don't know what to do.

10:41.771 --> 10:44.176
You know enough to ask for help.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.341
You are welcome here any time.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.856
Hey.

10:49.905 --> 10:51.939
You are not alone.

10:52.087 --> 10:53.716
You have people who care about you.

10:53.765 --> 10:55.349
Don't ever forget that.

10:58.608 --> 11:00.000
What are you doing here?

11:00.049 --> 11:02.116
- You never texted me back.
- Now is not a good time.

11:02.165 --> 11:03.756
- We need to talk.
- Cal, who is it?

11:03.805 --> 11:05.234
No one!

11:05.283 --> 11:07.843
Wait, are you still dating Eric Chee?

11:07.892 --> 11:10.257
We've been on and off again
since high school.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.148
Well, I don't care about him.

11:12.197 --> 11:13.894
I'm here for you, to represent you.

11:13.976 --> 11:16.745
- You represent me?
- My firm would.

11:16.899 --> 11:19.233
We just need more information
about your drug test.

11:21.713 --> 11:23.038
This is "no one"?

11:23.172 --> 11:24.937
Looks like little Luna Spence.

11:24.986 --> 11:26.366
How was the clink?

11:26.536 --> 11:28.273
Eric, don't be a dick.

11:28.611 --> 11:30.455
You selling insurance now or...

11:30.590 --> 11:33.952
Luna's law firm wants
to represent us in our case.

11:34.374 --> 11:35.806
What case?

11:35.937 --> 11:37.616
Against Family Services.

11:37.674 --> 11:40.108
Well, actually, it would be
against Clear Dawn,

11:40.289 --> 11:42.559
the lab that executed
the drug test you failed.

11:42.682 --> 11:43.836
Callie, you slipped up.

11:43.885 --> 11:45.679
A lawyer can't change that mistake.

11:45.728 --> 11:47.601
I've told you a million times,

11:47.650 --> 11:50.085
I wasn't high when I took that test.

11:50.195 --> 11:51.890
How can you tell if an addict's lying?

11:51.939 --> 11:53.007
Her lips are moving.

11:53.056 --> 11:54.835
Heh heh. You know, they, uh,

11:54.884 --> 11:57.023
they make that same joke about lawyers.

11:57.364 --> 11:58.875
Look, I believe you.

11:58.924 --> 12:00.796
We can prove it,
and we'll take care of you.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.595
I take care of my family.

12:02.878 --> 12:04.835
We didn't ask for your help
and we don't need it.

12:04.884 --> 12:06.186
Do we, Cal?

12:06.563 --> 12:09.131
I'm sorry you came all this way.

12:18.626 --> 12:21.648
How we present this offer
will determine how Kodie reacts.

12:21.697 --> 12:24.098
She wants her kids back, not money.

12:24.937 --> 12:26.483
Maybe she should take it.

12:26.532 --> 12:27.608
You're not serious.

12:27.657 --> 12:29.195
I'm just playing devil's advocate.

12:29.244 --> 12:31.601
They took her kids
away from her, Billy.

12:31.650 --> 12:33.382
No amount of money will ever
bring them back.

12:33.431 --> 12:35.556
I'm not talking about the money.

12:35.804 --> 12:38.312
I'm talking about being able
to focus on the criminal trial.

12:38.361 --> 12:40.145
She's not gonna see her kids
if she's in prison.

12:40.194 --> 12:41.741
That'll get thrown out entirely

12:41.790 --> 12:44.553
if we can prove that her kids
were wrongfully taken.

12:45.327 --> 12:46.858
We need to focus on Clear Dawn.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.534
Well then, we're gonna
need more leverage.

12:50.451 --> 12:51.788
Don't.

12:51.877 --> 12:53.554
Why are you so dug in on this?

12:53.603 --> 12:55.593
Because this is about Kodie.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.052
It's not just her.

12:57.101 --> 12:58.782
It's bigger than her and you know that.

12:58.893 --> 13:00.726
If we file a class action,

13:00.978 --> 13:03.070
Kodie's kids will be in college,

13:03.119 --> 13:04.846
by the time we go to court.

13:04.895 --> 13:06.847
I don't think
that's what this is about.

13:07.382 --> 13:09.582
So why don't you tell me what it is?

13:12.560 --> 13:14.493
I don't wanna talk about it,
Billy. Let's just...

13:14.988 --> 13:16.822
focus on the case.

13:31.666 --> 13:33.228
Oh, sweet baby Jesus.

13:33.277 --> 13:34.814
This is really not
what I need right now.

13:35.411 --> 13:36.685
Billy!

13:36.850 --> 13:38.373
You haven't been calling me back.

13:38.422 --> 13:40.255
Yeah, that's how ignoring people works.

13:42.010 --> 13:44.164
I heard you might be
going after Clear Dawn Labs.

13:44.549 --> 13:46.454
- Wait, how do you know that?
- This is Millwood, kid.

13:46.503 --> 13:48.550
Everybody knows everything.

13:49.476 --> 13:50.610
Look...

13:50.747 --> 13:52.432
I know a guy from the program

13:52.481 --> 13:53.776
who works there, in the lab.

13:53.825 --> 13:55.455
Oh, you're back on the wagon.

13:55.504 --> 13:57.225
Yeah, six days.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.639
Look, I know it's not much
but you gotta start somewhere, right?

14:01.236 --> 14:04.051
This guy could maybe help your case.

14:04.132 --> 14:05.907
I don't need your help.

14:06.184 --> 14:08.634
I know, but just in case...

14:08.725 --> 14:10.825
This is where we'll be.

14:15.945 --> 14:17.946
We'll be there.

14:24.778 --> 14:26.838
It's too late for a settlement.

14:26.887 --> 14:29.289
It's too late for any of this.

14:30.932 --> 14:33.072
I got this in the mail today.

14:36.220 --> 14:39.463
- This can't be right.
- 90 days.

14:39.602 --> 14:42.135
They're making her kids
permanent wards of the state.

14:42.217 --> 14:44.174
90 days.

14:44.223 --> 14:45.879
How long after that
until they're adopted,

14:45.928 --> 14:47.064
and gone forever?

14:47.113 --> 14:48.330
Is that legal?

14:48.497 --> 14:51.143
I'm sure after my joyride
they can do whatever they want.

14:51.192 --> 14:53.455
OK. We can use their offer
to our advantage.

14:53.504 --> 14:55.142
They want us to lay down but we can't.

14:55.276 --> 14:58.096
You tell me to stay strong and be brave,
but...

14:58.239 --> 15:00.264
I'm here all alone.

15:01.476 --> 15:04.836
You aren't alone in this, Kodie.

15:05.728 --> 15:07.736
So many other mothers
have gone through this

15:07.785 --> 15:09.785
and it's time for us
to bring them into this fight.

15:11.026 --> 15:13.467
We are gonna force
the courts to hear us

15:13.598 --> 15:16.022
because we'll be too loud
for them not to.

15:18.472 --> 15:21.240
We're going to certify
as a class action.

15:41.137 --> 15:43.272
OK. Here's a list
of potential plaintiffs,

15:43.656 --> 15:46.313
people who may wanna join our case.

15:47.437 --> 15:48.996
This isn't a lot to go off.

15:49.053 --> 15:50.614
The redacted files were all we had.

15:50.663 --> 15:52.715
It's enough, we just go door-to-door,
give them our pitch.

15:52.764 --> 15:53.980
We need as many people as possible.

15:54.029 --> 15:56.196
I don't see Callie's name
on here. Do you mind if I...

15:56.287 --> 15:58.520
Go. We need as many names
as we can get.

15:59.103 --> 16:00.709
I'm all over it.

16:08.785 --> 16:10.185
Hi, Mrs. Caden.

16:10.234 --> 16:12.991
My name's Joanna Chang.
I'm a lawyer for...

16:26.410 --> 16:29.112
Hi. I'm Catherine Carmichael
from Crawford Chang.

16:29.239 --> 16:32.105
We've recently begun litigation
on a class action lawsuit...

16:33.434 --> 16:34.492
Hi.

16:34.541 --> 16:37.175
I'm from Crawford Chang.

16:41.754 --> 16:43.354
Whatever you're selling,
I already got three.

16:43.402 --> 16:44.707
I'm not selling anything, Susan.

16:44.756 --> 16:46.653
I wanted to inform you that we've begun

16:46.702 --> 16:48.885
a legal action against Clear Dawn Labs.

16:49.202 --> 16:50.606
And I was wondering,

16:50.655 --> 16:52.543
if you'd be interested
in joining our suit.

16:52.592 --> 16:55.593
I heard about this.
You and Billy Crawford.

16:55.938 --> 16:58.270
- The ones that sued the mill.
- Yes!

16:58.319 --> 17:00.168
We were able to successfully
win compensation,

17:00.217 --> 17:01.658
for the victims in that case.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.465
I don't want anything
to do with you two.

17:03.514 --> 17:04.932
We're here to help you.

17:05.137 --> 17:07.511
My husband worked at the mill.

17:07.590 --> 17:10.027
When it closed down, that's when the...

17:11.074 --> 17:12.603
Couldn't pay the bills at first.

17:12.652 --> 17:14.525
Then, we couldn't buy food.

17:15.377 --> 17:16.934
Then, they took Angie.

17:18.246 --> 17:19.768
I am so sorry.

17:20.003 --> 17:22.300
Please don't pretend
you care about me, OK?

17:22.439 --> 17:25.172
You're the reason I lost my kid.

17:31.621 --> 17:34.249
- Callie?
- Oh! Oh, jeez.

17:34.504 --> 17:36.685
- You scared the crap out of me.
- Sorry.

17:37.652 --> 17:38.828
Look...

17:38.948 --> 17:41.161
I can see you're in a bad spot.

17:41.210 --> 17:43.355
It's a lot more complicated than that.

17:43.652 --> 17:46.294
Callie, we're starting a class
action against Clear Dawn.

17:46.355 --> 17:48.997
He doesn't think getting
involved is a good idea.

17:49.496 --> 17:50.629
All due respect,

17:50.678 --> 17:52.578
but Eric doesn't know
what he's talking about.

17:52.820 --> 17:54.520
You've never liked him.

17:54.569 --> 17:55.957
Because he's jealous,

17:56.022 --> 17:57.275
and manipulative.

17:57.475 --> 17:58.974
He hasn't changed since high school.

17:59.067 --> 18:00.692
He's protective is all.

18:00.967 --> 18:03.096
He wants what's best for his family.

18:03.523 --> 18:05.210
And what do you want?

18:06.176 --> 18:08.303
If you were clean
when you took that test...

18:08.352 --> 18:10.685
I was, Luna. I swear to God.

18:10.738 --> 18:12.554
Then you're entitled to damages.

18:12.872 --> 18:14.278
Money?

18:14.387 --> 18:16.089
Might be a fresh start.

18:16.226 --> 18:18.260
Just you and your baby.

18:18.832 --> 18:20.322
He'll never let me go.

18:20.371 --> 18:22.097
He doesn't have to know.

18:22.379 --> 18:23.943
You can come and stay with me.

18:24.037 --> 18:25.231
Let me help you.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.762
- I don't think I can.
- Don't think.

18:27.811 --> 18:30.505
Just do.

18:33.276 --> 18:35.210
I...

18:35.848 --> 18:38.324
- You have a nice day now too.
- This isn't working.

18:38.449 --> 18:39.840
I don't know.

18:39.889 --> 18:42.012
I'm getting used to doors
slamming in my face.

18:42.061 --> 18:43.903
At this rate, it's gonna take months

18:43.952 --> 18:45.929
if not years to get people to sign on.

18:45.978 --> 18:47.811
We'll get faster and more efficient.

18:47.891 --> 18:50.297
They aren't even sticking
around to hear our pitch.

18:50.346 --> 18:52.793
We need something
that's gonna work fast.

18:55.949 --> 18:58.183
I have an idea that I hate.

19:01.448 --> 19:02.498
Ahem.

19:02.546 --> 19:04.416
And... ready.

19:04.465 --> 19:06.208
And... action!

19:06.987 --> 19:08.816
Have your children been apprehended,

19:08.865 --> 19:12.285
because of a faulty drug test
at Clear Dawn Labs?

19:12.355 --> 19:14.322
Did you know, in your heart of hearts,

19:14.371 --> 19:16.415
that the results were wrong?

19:17.574 --> 19:18.986
- I... It's my...
- On Thur...

19:19.035 --> 19:20.722
No, it's my line. It's my line.

19:21.039 --> 19:22.791
On Thursday,
we'll be holding a meeting.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.463
You know what, I can't do this... this.

19:25.512 --> 19:26.989
I can't do this.

19:34.181 --> 19:36.282
If my father could see me now...

19:36.706 --> 19:38.940
Well, maybe it's a good thing he can't.

19:41.628 --> 19:43.410
I can't do this.

19:44.926 --> 19:46.507
Which "this" are you talking about?

19:46.556 --> 19:49.023
All of it.

19:50.780 --> 19:52.827
Well, whatever you wanna do,

19:54.032 --> 19:55.932
I got your back.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.884
I wanna get Kodie her kids back

20:00.550 --> 20:02.978
and a class action is
the best way to do that, I know,

20:03.027 --> 20:04.814
but I can't get through
this stupid commercial.

20:04.863 --> 20:06.601
You're overthinking it, Chang.

20:06.921 --> 20:09.035
I've seen what your passion
can do firsthand.

20:09.258 --> 20:11.480
Just attack it like a closing argument.

20:11.637 --> 20:13.175
Be immaculate with your words.

20:14.144 --> 20:15.810
- Hey, you got that from...
- You.

20:16.312 --> 20:17.646
Yeah.

20:18.004 --> 20:19.418
Let's go have some fun.

20:21.488 --> 20:22.856
Were your children apprehended,

20:22.905 --> 20:24.707
because you failed a
Clear Dawn drug test?

20:24.756 --> 20:26.137
Did you know, in your heart of hearts,

20:26.186 --> 20:27.260
that the results were wrong?

20:27.309 --> 20:28.887
You didn't fail the test.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.029
They failed you.

20:30.078 --> 20:32.707
At Crawford Chang,
we have your interests at heart.

20:32.769 --> 20:34.254
On Thursday,
we'll be holding a meeting,

20:34.303 --> 20:35.879
to discuss your legal options

20:35.928 --> 20:38.777
and find a way to give
you what you deserve.

20:39.210 --> 20:40.499
Together.

20:42.715 --> 20:44.215
Well...

20:44.421 --> 20:46.364
Now we just have to wait
and see if people show up.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.817
They will.

20:47.934 --> 20:49.878
They have to... for Kodie.

20:50.824 --> 20:52.306
I'm more worried about certification.

20:52.355 --> 20:53.814
One thing at a time.

20:54.215 --> 20:56.361
- We've been here before.
- Not with this much at stake.

20:56.472 --> 20:58.503
Still, a pattern of false positives?

20:58.940 --> 21:00.447
We have experience
in this kind of suit.

21:00.496 --> 21:02.986
Except this time, we don't
have my father to blackmail.

21:03.035 --> 21:04.434
That's not why we won.

21:04.483 --> 21:06.302
You know that isn't true.

21:07.975 --> 21:10.843
And... if I could
find us a whistleblower?

21:11.465 --> 21:13.001
If.

21:13.762 --> 21:17.402
Until then, I can't drink,
so let's call it a night.

21:17.681 --> 21:20.175
And we're still not gonna talk
about that other thing?

21:21.176 --> 21:22.894
After we win certification.

21:46.222 --> 21:49.066
I don't know what's got a harder
hold on me, you know? The...

21:49.613 --> 21:51.418
The ponies or the booze, or...

21:53.449 --> 21:55.450
Women or food.

21:55.499 --> 21:56.762
Hello, my name is Hank

21:56.811 --> 21:59.211
and I'm addicted to everything.

22:00.096 --> 22:02.222
I've been clean for, um...

22:02.527 --> 22:03.603
Seven days.

22:03.683 --> 22:07.199
And the last time I used,
I was with my son Billy, here.

22:07.744 --> 22:10.121
I hadn't seen him in a lot of years.

22:14.873 --> 22:17.769
And I had to go
and screw it up all over again.

22:20.103 --> 22:22.638
I don't know if I'll ever
forgive myself for that.

22:25.571 --> 22:28.199
Must be weird for you, being back.

22:28.391 --> 22:30.144
"Just when I thought I was out,"

22:30.254 --> 22:31.867
"they pull me back in."

22:32.375 --> 22:33.672
Who's "they"?

22:33.721 --> 22:37.341
It's from The Godfather,
Part III, but still.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.478
Eric doesn't like going to the movies.

22:40.485 --> 22:42.552
There's a movie club at U of M.

22:43.297 --> 22:44.881
They play old classic movies.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.275
Kind of awesome.

22:46.324 --> 22:47.895
I've never been to the city.

22:47.944 --> 22:49.851
What?!

22:49.900 --> 22:52.446
Eric says we have everything we need,

22:52.495 --> 22:53.971
right here in Millwood.

22:56.727 --> 22:58.359
There's a whole world out there

22:58.408 --> 23:00.308
and it belongs to you and your baby.

23:00.540 --> 23:02.524
I do like the sound of that.

23:04.386 --> 23:06.603
You really think this is
gonna work out for me?

23:06.652 --> 23:08.274
Saw that commercial.

23:08.802 --> 23:10.687
You didn't think I could find you.

23:11.152 --> 23:13.436
I've got this.

23:15.744 --> 23:17.009
Can I talk to you alone, please?

23:17.058 --> 23:18.439
Look, whatever you have to say to her,

23:18.488 --> 23:20.068
- you can say to me.
- Luna, don't.

23:20.117 --> 23:21.863
- Come home now.
- No!

23:21.924 --> 23:23.565
GET IN THE CAR!

23:23.614 --> 23:26.255
I'm not getting in your disgusting car.

23:26.304 --> 23:27.602
Well, who's gonna take care of you?

23:27.690 --> 23:29.659
I can take care of myself.

23:56.085 --> 23:58.019
God grant me the serenity

23:58.068 --> 24:00.758
to get through this putrid coffee.

24:00.925 --> 24:03.082
- Shaky.
- I'm Billy.

24:03.366 --> 24:05.287
You worked for Clear Dawn Labs?

24:05.445 --> 24:07.051
Why are you asking?

24:08.030 --> 24:09.767
I'm the lawyer.

24:11.863 --> 24:14.004
I'm working on a case.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.840
Against Clear Dawn?

24:15.929 --> 24:18.043
- My dad didn't tell you?
- No.

24:18.155 --> 24:21.527
Probably knew if he did,
I wouldn't have shown up.

24:21.932 --> 24:24.325
Alright, so anything
you tell me is 100%...

24:24.374 --> 24:26.895
Anonymous. Sure. Here.

24:27.724 --> 24:29.598
But outside these walls?

24:29.715 --> 24:31.232
Tell me what you know about Clear Dawn.

24:31.281 --> 24:33.468
You have my guarantee
of absolute protection.

24:33.882 --> 24:36.638
- 500 bucks.
- Sorry?

24:36.746 --> 24:38.265
Cash.

24:40.177 --> 24:42.677
Let's find somewhere quieter to talk.

24:47.059 --> 24:48.437
Where are you taking me?

24:48.585 --> 24:50.451
I told you, it's a surprise.

24:50.500 --> 24:52.542
And I told you I hate surprises.

24:53.207 --> 24:55.109
You managed to get me
out of the house so that...

24:55.158 --> 24:56.575
Special dispensation.

24:56.624 --> 24:57.903
I promise you, it'll be worth it.

24:59.176 --> 25:00.958
Joanna, what's going on?

25:01.007 --> 25:03.496
It is a meeting with
potential plaintiffs,

25:03.709 --> 25:05.618
other people in the
same position as you.

25:05.667 --> 25:07.066
Right this way.

25:13.460 --> 25:15.627
You told me I wasn't alone,

25:15.676 --> 25:17.812
and then you go and prove it.

25:18.118 --> 25:19.951
That's the job.

25:21.483 --> 25:24.052
Joanna... thank you.

25:30.141 --> 25:33.895
Thank you all, for showing up
on short notice.

25:33.969 --> 25:35.481
We've filed a statement of claim

25:35.530 --> 25:37.663
against Clear Dawn Labs for negligence.

25:37.802 --> 25:39.099
We have a strong case

25:39.148 --> 25:40.536
but if we stand together,

25:40.585 --> 25:42.214
we will be stronger.

25:45.372 --> 25:46.856
In the short term,

25:46.905 --> 25:49.294
if we're able to certify
as a class action suit,

25:49.343 --> 25:51.713
we will have sufficient
evidentiary weight,

25:51.762 --> 25:53.913
to file an interlocutory injunction

25:53.962 --> 25:56.843
to halt any and all child adoptions.

25:59.804 --> 26:01.898
It would stop...

26:01.947 --> 26:04.380
any children who have been
removed from your custody

26:04.429 --> 26:07.886
from being adopted until
the conclusion of the trial.

26:10.907 --> 26:13.689
Anyone interested,
please just head over there

26:13.738 --> 26:16.163
and sign our retainer agreement

26:16.212 --> 26:18.455
so that we can officially
represent you.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.679
Don't be shy, just...

26:21.907 --> 26:23.801
Head on over.

26:28.063 --> 26:30.491
Maybe you have questions first?

26:32.183 --> 26:35.351
I don't really know
anything about DNA markers.

26:35.462 --> 26:37.306
I work in accounting.

26:37.780 --> 26:40.716
What we need is someone to
testify that the science is bad.

26:40.765 --> 26:43.099
If you're only thinking
about the science,

26:43.234 --> 26:45.368
you're not looking
at the bigger picture.

26:46.410 --> 26:48.163
OK, so where should we be looking?

26:48.262 --> 26:51.267
Somewhere that could be dangerous.

26:51.316 --> 26:52.819
You sure you wanna go there?

26:52.868 --> 26:55.167
- I don't know.
- "I don't know" is

26:55.225 --> 26:57.538
the greatest prayer in the world.

26:57.648 --> 26:59.352
Look at the volume.

26:59.484 --> 27:01.283
The number of tests performed?

27:01.380 --> 27:03.986
Budget for tests is static,

27:04.112 --> 27:07.569
even when the number of tests went up.

27:09.039 --> 27:10.873
They did 700 last year.

27:10.922 --> 27:13.484
Up from 500 the year before.

27:13.898 --> 27:16.673
If we're doing more tests...

27:17.235 --> 27:19.468
it should cost more.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.772
So someone's cutting corners.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.894
We can go somewhere else if you want.

27:27.194 --> 27:29.111
No, no. Here is as good as anywhere.

27:29.210 --> 27:32.162
I guess I'm just not that thirsty.

27:33.450 --> 27:35.318
I'm actually thinking about
heading back to the city.

27:35.453 --> 27:37.038
You just got here.

27:37.087 --> 27:38.882
Country air'll do you good.

27:38.968 --> 27:40.733
That's not how air works.

27:43.114 --> 27:45.647
Alright, chug that back.

27:45.696 --> 27:47.696
Let's get out of here, boys.

27:49.834 --> 27:52.462
- Same time next week, Sammy?
- You know it.

27:54.842 --> 27:56.343
What's wrong?

27:56.603 --> 27:59.599
I just forgot how small this town was.

28:00.638 --> 28:03.171
Why can't you ever run
into people you like?

28:03.718 --> 28:05.702
Because if you like someone,

28:05.921 --> 28:08.460
you're supposed
to go out and find them.

28:08.670 --> 28:10.624
And apologize.

28:11.179 --> 28:12.413
Apologize?

28:12.462 --> 28:15.357
I'm just guessing
that we're talking about Luna.

28:15.704 --> 28:17.379
Look, whatever you did,

28:17.428 --> 28:19.225
or think you did,

28:19.499 --> 28:21.917
it's not as easy to break
a connection as you think.

28:23.694 --> 28:24.905
Hmm.

28:25.281 --> 28:27.945
Has anyone ever told you
how good you are at what you do?

28:28.060 --> 28:29.797
Yes.

28:29.854 --> 28:31.889
But it's always nice to hear it again.

28:48.731 --> 28:51.378
Yeah, she helped
in the bar crawl last week.

28:51.562 --> 28:53.162
See that there?
Yeah, it looks alright, eh?

29:58.061 --> 29:59.536
Hey!

30:18.815 --> 30:21.250
Well, why aren't you
suing Family Services?

30:21.353 --> 30:23.118
They're the ones who took our kids.

30:23.167 --> 30:24.432
That's a good question.

30:24.481 --> 30:26.074
Um, Millwood Family Services

30:26.123 --> 30:27.910
is just doing what they're
obligated to do,

30:27.959 --> 30:30.580
but they are acting on bad science.

30:30.814 --> 30:33.963
Clear Dawn's drug tests are
the real culprit here.

30:34.252 --> 30:36.744
What about the kids
that have already been adopted?

30:37.284 --> 30:39.168
Adoptions are typically permanent.

30:41.138 --> 30:43.606
That's not a reason to give up.
There's still hope.

30:43.853 --> 30:45.541
Hope of getting paid?

30:45.705 --> 30:47.846
I mean, that's what this is
really about, right?

30:47.895 --> 30:50.956
Money is how the civil courts
measure wins and losses.

30:51.005 --> 30:52.081
It's just the reality.

30:52.130 --> 30:53.292
And you'd take a cut?

30:53.341 --> 30:55.463
That's not why I'm here,
if that's what you're implying.

30:55.934 --> 30:58.020
Money damages are leverage.

30:58.237 --> 31:00.003
Like I said, when we win,

31:00.052 --> 31:01.830
we will have
cut the head off Clear Dawn.

31:01.879 --> 31:03.620
My child is gone.

31:03.669 --> 31:05.172
Money can't buy her back.

31:05.221 --> 31:08.276
This is about getting all
of you through this together.

31:08.325 --> 31:09.889
Why shouldn't I get my own lawyer?

31:09.938 --> 31:12.424
You're lumping me in
with all these people.

31:13.135 --> 31:14.516
What do you mean by that?

31:14.565 --> 31:16.038
Nothing.

31:16.308 --> 31:17.956
Are you calling me a racist?

31:18.005 --> 31:19.604
Don't have to.

31:19.653 --> 31:21.102
Get out of my face.

31:21.151 --> 31:23.012
Everyone, please!

31:23.745 --> 31:25.147
Please.

31:27.071 --> 31:29.706
You have all been through a lot.

31:29.786 --> 31:31.822
But we are stronger
if we do this as a team.

31:31.871 --> 31:33.479
And why should we trust you?

31:34.002 --> 31:36.116
Someone who isn't even a mother.

31:37.791 --> 31:39.425
Another excellent question.

31:40.661 --> 31:43.619
Why should you trust
someone who isn't a mother?

31:43.701 --> 31:46.532
- This is funny to you?
- No.

31:47.271 --> 31:49.338
No, this isn't funny at all.

31:50.362 --> 31:52.541
It's just...

31:53.440 --> 31:54.743
I'm pregnant.

32:04.958 --> 32:07.736
I don't know if I can...

32:08.166 --> 32:10.745
be one... a mother.

32:10.794 --> 32:13.869
I don't even know if I
want to be one and...

32:14.432 --> 32:18.079
I am standing in a room
full of reasons not to be.

32:18.628 --> 32:21.039
And that terrifies me.

32:25.636 --> 32:27.289
But this isn't about me,

32:27.338 --> 32:29.445
although I've kind of
turned things that way.

32:29.940 --> 32:31.508
I'm sorry.

32:31.682 --> 32:34.083
This isn't how I intended to do this.

32:34.716 --> 32:36.251
Any of this.

32:37.384 --> 32:40.383
I cannot imagine

32:40.432 --> 32:43.177
how difficult it must
be to be a parent.

32:45.799 --> 32:48.427
And... and I know...

32:49.317 --> 32:51.483
That you didn't do
what they said you did.

32:53.627 --> 32:57.432
So let's make this
about getting you justice

32:57.760 --> 32:59.908
and bringing your children home.

33:35.474 --> 33:38.021
That was the craziest-ass
pitch I've ever seen.

33:39.822 --> 33:41.589
But oddly effective.

33:43.915 --> 33:46.851
It looks like we've got our class.

33:54.998 --> 33:56.966
The drug tests are our foundation.

33:57.015 --> 33:58.662
We're not trying facts today,

33:58.711 --> 34:01.233
but objective data is always
a good weapon.

34:01.282 --> 34:02.422
You told me certification

34:02.471 --> 34:03.975
was just a checkmark,
not The Hunger Games.

34:04.024 --> 34:05.894
They're not gonna pull
any punches, neither do we.

34:05.943 --> 34:07.776
I think they counter
that our claim is meritless.

34:07.856 --> 34:09.043
Good thing we have proof it's not.

34:09.092 --> 34:10.731
Or maybe that the class is overbroad.

34:10.780 --> 34:12.848
Our class is specific.

34:12.897 --> 34:14.324
We just need to posit enough facts

34:14.373 --> 34:16.529
for a reasonable expectation for trial.

34:17.186 --> 34:19.553
- We're good, right?
- You got this.

34:20.094 --> 34:22.094
We've got this.

34:23.983 --> 34:25.951
We are seeking to certify
a class of parents

34:26.000 --> 34:28.934
whose children were
unjustly apprehended

34:28.983 --> 34:30.429
into government custody

34:30.478 --> 34:33.235
due to the negligence
of Clear Dawn Labs,

34:33.306 --> 34:35.632
who willingly and knowingly

34:35.681 --> 34:38.070
implemented a flawed
chemical analysis system

34:38.119 --> 34:41.099
that misrepresented
our clients as drug users

34:41.197 --> 34:45.139
Our proposed class have all
suffered tremendously,

34:45.281 --> 34:47.855
both financially and emotionally.

34:47.904 --> 34:49.493
If you will turn to the analysis

34:49.565 --> 34:51.592
completed on September 15th.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.316
Heard about the big town hall meeting.

34:58.388 --> 35:00.313
Figured you'd be here.

35:00.820 --> 35:03.211
Used to hang out
at this spot all the time.

35:03.515 --> 35:05.891
I think I smoked my first joint
under this very tree.

35:05.940 --> 35:07.570
That... was not pretty.

35:10.516 --> 35:12.841
Molly and I had our first kiss here.

35:13.868 --> 35:15.556
Eugh.

35:15.605 --> 35:16.930
I mean, is the tree cursed?

35:18.549 --> 35:20.482
Pretty sure it's just a tree.

35:22.857 --> 35:24.157
Uh...

35:24.226 --> 35:25.383
That day at the office,

35:25.432 --> 35:27.580
when I said you were living my life...

35:28.266 --> 35:29.413
I'm really sorry.

35:29.477 --> 35:30.734
You don't need to apologize.

35:30.799 --> 35:32.674
Well, too late. I just did.

35:32.789 --> 35:34.471
You were just trying to help.

35:35.508 --> 35:37.094
And sisters fight.

35:37.198 --> 35:38.612
And they forgive.

35:38.738 --> 35:40.406
Is that what we are?

35:40.737 --> 35:42.448
If we choose to be.

35:43.794 --> 35:46.008
What if I keep following that john?

35:46.249 --> 35:48.585
Depends, are you gonna catch him?

35:49.119 --> 35:51.522
Well, I need your help.

35:52.055 --> 35:54.422
I caught him meeting with Sam Mercer.

35:55.627 --> 35:57.862
Wait. How often does this happen?

35:57.996 --> 36:00.586
Every week. Same time, same place.

36:00.793 --> 36:02.859
Taylor, you want my help?

36:03.141 --> 36:04.876
You need to show these to Owen.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.258
Please turn to the submitted documents.

36:09.398 --> 36:11.709
We have 27 signed affidavits,

36:11.758 --> 36:14.453
of parents contesting
Clear Dawn's test results.

36:14.601 --> 36:18.649
And an independent, drug-free
test of Mushkode Chartrand,

36:18.754 --> 36:19.844
who'd still have her children

36:19.901 --> 36:21.305
if not for the negligence

36:21.354 --> 36:22.520
of Clear Dawn Labs.

36:22.569 --> 36:24.891
Your Honour, these allegations
against my client

36:24.940 --> 36:27.000
are offensive and hideous.

36:27.096 --> 36:29.125
Wow. Tell us how you really feel.

36:29.215 --> 36:30.836
Ms. Chang.

36:31.135 --> 36:33.336
Don't mischaracterize the claims.

36:33.797 --> 36:35.445
We're not here to argue facts,

36:35.502 --> 36:36.805
but even if those facts are true,

36:36.854 --> 36:39.055
the proposed class is overbroad.

36:39.104 --> 36:40.784
I mean, yes,
they've had their children taken, but

36:40.832 --> 36:42.547
the how and why vary drastically

36:42.596 --> 36:44.175
in timing and circumstance.

36:44.539 --> 36:46.170
And so even if the tests were flawed,

36:46.219 --> 36:48.424
and we are not conceding that,

36:48.715 --> 36:51.625
the plaintiffs would have to
prove that in each individual case,

36:51.674 --> 36:52.838
that was the direct cause

36:52.886 --> 36:54.234
of the apprehension.

36:54.448 --> 36:57.121
The differences in cases make
a class action overly complex

36:57.219 --> 36:58.956
and will drain the court's resources.

36:59.241 --> 37:01.195
It is simply not the preferable course.

37:01.296 --> 37:02.675
Thank you.

37:04.643 --> 37:06.602
Your Honour, I request a recess.

37:06.651 --> 37:08.359
On what grounds?

37:09.203 --> 37:10.451
I'm pregnant.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.586
- Relevance?
- I have to pee.

37:13.617 --> 37:15.020
Fine, eh...

37:15.077 --> 37:17.498
Let's take 10 minutes
and we'll finish up.

37:25.066 --> 37:26.699
One minute.

37:34.047 --> 37:36.447
You just told a judge
you had to pee, so...

37:37.640 --> 37:39.948
- we must be in trouble.
- We are.

37:40.874 --> 37:42.209
Billy...

37:42.827 --> 37:44.823
We are going to lose.

37:46.070 --> 37:47.498
All these people put their faith in me

37:47.547 --> 37:48.922
and I'm about to let them down.

37:48.971 --> 37:50.435
Hey, you do not stop fighting

37:50.484 --> 37:52.210
until the fight is done.

37:52.516 --> 37:54.879
That one's also you.
You're very quotable.

37:56.495 --> 37:58.063
So wipe the sweat off your face

37:58.112 --> 37:59.695
and get back in the ring.

38:00.630 --> 38:02.719
If this is what being a mother's like,

38:03.082 --> 38:04.743
constantly not being good enough,

38:04.792 --> 38:07.451
disappointing people,
disappointing yourself...

38:09.442 --> 38:12.397
...it gives me a whole new
appreciation for my own.

38:12.945 --> 38:14.989
Well, you should tell her that...

38:16.109 --> 38:17.627
After we win certification.

38:17.754 --> 38:20.422
And how are we going to do that?

38:22.646 --> 38:24.373
I don't know.

38:25.015 --> 38:26.599
But win or lose,

38:26.648 --> 38:28.976
at least those 27 women know
it wasn't their fault,

38:29.078 --> 38:30.811
and keep fighting.

38:30.945 --> 38:33.367
How? They can't even afford
their own lawyers.

38:38.683 --> 38:39.995
Wait.

38:40.633 --> 38:42.793
Billy, that's the argument.

38:45.928 --> 38:47.539
You're brilliant.

38:54.993 --> 38:56.760
None of my clients could
afford me, Your Honour.

38:58.292 --> 38:59.401
Are you bragging?

38:59.450 --> 39:01.055
Are you, Ms. Chang?

39:01.150 --> 39:04.023
I am simply stating
an indisputable fact.

39:04.135 --> 39:05.912
They couldn't afford you either.

39:05.961 --> 39:08.027
Or you, Your Honour, back in the day.

39:08.625 --> 39:12.079
All of our clients live
below the poverty line.

39:12.289 --> 39:14.345
They have limited economic means,

39:14.394 --> 39:16.086
limited access to justice.

39:16.135 --> 39:17.581
These people are poor.

39:17.675 --> 39:19.709
That doesn't magically give
her case merit, Your Honour.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.685
Why don't you let
me decide that, Mr. Page?

39:21.734 --> 39:23.281
She's playing
on the court's sympathies.

39:23.330 --> 39:25.197
I'm not playing at anything.

39:25.398 --> 39:26.891
This isn't a game.

39:27.006 --> 39:29.004
These are children we're talking about.

39:30.507 --> 39:32.773
Being poor in this country means that

39:32.823 --> 39:34.423
you're more likely to
have your children taken.

39:34.471 --> 39:35.789
That's a fact.

39:35.892 --> 39:38.047
And it makes it 10 times harder for you

39:38.096 --> 39:40.504
to get those kids back.
Also just a fact.

39:40.553 --> 39:42.037
- Your Honour...
- Let her finish.

39:42.140 --> 39:44.887
Being poor is the commonality here.

39:45.146 --> 39:48.044
Certification is these parents'
only chance at justice.

39:48.093 --> 39:49.625
And a class action...

39:49.727 --> 39:54.492
Is their only viable legal recourse.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.205
Thank you, Your Honour.

39:59.797 --> 40:02.143
Do you think
I made a mistake with Callie?

40:02.430 --> 40:03.761
You mean inviting her to stay with you?

40:05.276 --> 40:07.731
You're impulsive, but in a good way.

40:08.331 --> 40:10.086
I'm worried it might be too far.

40:10.413 --> 40:13.087
Joanna's always talking about
maintaining our objectivity.

40:14.297 --> 40:15.821
Well,
I don't think Joanna would ever let

40:15.870 --> 40:18.008
her client crash on
her leather sectional.

40:18.234 --> 40:19.944
Callie was a friend first.

40:20.413 --> 40:22.484
It's tough to be a good lawyer
and a good friend.

40:22.596 --> 40:24.396
I'll find a way to be both.

40:26.227 --> 40:29.000
It's amazing, you know,
how much you care about people.

40:29.781 --> 40:30.888
Be careful.

40:31.343 --> 40:33.477
I can manage.

40:41.265 --> 40:43.930
All good. Everything's
in there. I re-sealed it.

40:44.474 --> 40:46.203
I'll have to check it.

40:46.781 --> 40:48.601
Not that you did anything wrong, but...

40:48.776 --> 40:50.259
It has to match my report.

40:50.617 --> 40:51.775
Of course.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.321
- You're doing a good job, Officer.
- Thank you, sir.

40:55.370 --> 40:56.875
With all due respect...

40:57.492 --> 40:59.320
You shouldn't let
lawyers push you around.

40:59.422 --> 41:02.052
My dad's a lawyer.
I know they can be bullies.

41:02.629 --> 41:04.149
Uh-huh.

41:04.754 --> 41:06.907
Well, they're always looking
for shortcuts. That's for sure.

41:07.140 --> 41:09.071
Police procedure takes long,

41:09.120 --> 41:11.248
but there's a reason we do
things the right way.

41:12.063 --> 41:13.896
Not that I have to tell you that, sir.

41:13.984 --> 41:15.359
Yeah, but still.

41:16.096 --> 41:17.853
It's nice to be reminded.

41:22.109 --> 41:24.074
- Taylor.
- Hey.

41:25.055 --> 41:26.710
I think there's something
you need to see.

41:34.562 --> 41:36.187
I'm not supposed to drink coffee.

41:36.328 --> 41:39.008
- It's chamomile tea.
- Oh. Great.

41:39.057 --> 41:40.125
I'm 80 now.

41:40.213 --> 41:41.369
With a shot of bourbon in it.

41:43.531 --> 41:46.230
You know, I have never seen
a better summation.

41:46.703 --> 41:48.042
Thank you.

41:48.936 --> 41:50.545
I wish Kodie was in there.

41:51.249 --> 41:52.672
She was.

41:52.784 --> 41:54.966
They all were.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.500
I know.

41:56.549 --> 41:58.274
I don't know what's wrong with me, I...

41:58.323 --> 41:59.695
Think it must be the hormones.

42:01.765 --> 42:03.486
The facts are on our side now,
we just...

42:03.535 --> 42:04.984
Hope the judge is too.

42:05.264 --> 42:07.008
God grant me the serenity

42:07.057 --> 42:08.641
to accept the things I cannot change,

42:08.690 --> 42:10.381
the courage to change the things I can

42:10.430 --> 42:12.389
and the wisdom to know the difference.

42:12.664 --> 42:14.391
It's out of our control now.

42:14.867 --> 42:17.979
Yeah. That's why I hate this part.

42:19.350 --> 42:20.955
What are we doing?

42:21.133 --> 42:23.555
We're sitting in a park.

42:23.876 --> 42:25.290
I'm drinking potpourri and

42:25.339 --> 42:27.280
waiting for a judge to decide our fate.

42:27.354 --> 42:28.649
No...

42:28.846 --> 42:30.456
What are we gonna do?

42:32.435 --> 42:34.316
What do you wanna do?

42:37.578 --> 42:39.267
I don't know.

42:40.310 --> 42:42.368
And I hate not knowing.

42:43.182 --> 42:44.540
Shaky says "I don't know"

42:44.589 --> 42:46.755
is the greatest prayer in the world.

42:48.467 --> 42:49.579
Who's Shaky?

42:52.914 --> 42:55.252
- They're ready for us.
- Hey.

42:56.867 --> 42:58.336
Whatever happens in there,

42:58.461 --> 43:00.070
and whatever we decide...

43:01.317 --> 43:02.555
I love you.

43:02.994 --> 43:04.172
I know.

43:08.961 --> 43:10.678
I know we're not here
to determine the merit

43:10.727 --> 43:12.243
but there is a case here,

43:12.292 --> 43:15.060
and every one of these people
deserves their day in court.

43:15.378 --> 43:16.874
Individually.

43:17.611 --> 43:18.911
It is the court's decision

43:18.960 --> 43:20.709
that a class action is not
the procedure

43:20.758 --> 43:22.055
for resolving this conflict.

43:22.104 --> 43:25.040
- Your Honour...
- The court denies certification.
