00:22.312 --> 00:25.300
Mom ! Bart's drinking coffee!

00:25.301 --> 00:27.434
It's not coffee,
it's hot Pepsi.

00:27.477 --> 00:29.696
You're the worst husband in the world!

00:29.697 --> 00:32.932
Yeah, well, I wish I'd married Patty and Selma.

00:32.933 --> 00:35.709
I wish I'd married Lenny and his friend.

00:35.910 --> 00:38.518
Man, Mom and Dad are really going at it.

00:38.890 --> 00:40.825
I hope everything's okay.

00:40.826 --> 00:43.072
Don't you spit sunflower seeds at me.

00:43.158 --> 00:44.530
You used to love it!

00:44.614 --> 00:45.541
Mm...

00:47.343 --> 00:50.481
Recording that fake fight was a great idea.

00:50.481 --> 00:53.709
Now the kids won't bother us during our morning snuggle.

00:55.039 --> 00:56.350
Dear Lord, thank you

00:56.356 --> 00:59.861
for the physical intimacy we are about to enjoy.

00:59.866 --> 01:00.992
And as always,

01:00.998 --> 01:02.762
have fun watching.

01:02.966 --> 01:05.670
Go... lovemaking!

01:05.677 --> 01:06.703
Mm...

01:06.705 --> 01:09.402
And I hate the cutesy way you make jack-o'-lanterns!

01:09.408 --> 01:12.963
I like scary Halloween,
not funny Halloween!

01:14.606 --> 01:19.142
<i>I been through the desert
on a horse with no name</i>

01:19.147 --> 01:22.231
<i>It felt good to be out of the rain</i>

01:22.926 --> 01:24.742
County fair music?

01:27.005 --> 01:28.680
Whoo, whoo.

01:31.785 --> 01:33.782
Milhouse, steady my Duds.

01:34.155 --> 01:35.492
Trust me, Bart.

01:35.496 --> 01:39.472
It's better to walk in on both your parents than on just one of 'em.

01:39.477 --> 01:42.000
Hey, dinks, give me your lunch money!

01:43.257 --> 01:45.693
But what will I eat at midday?

01:45.695 --> 01:47.210
I can't solve all your problems.

01:47.217 --> 01:48.670
Just hand over the money.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.912
Thanks, wads, and I hope to see you both Saturday.

01:53.046 --> 01:53.941
Huh?

01:54.515 --> 01:56.051
Come to my party or die.

01:56.565 --> 01:58.242
Come to my party or die.

01:58.246 --> 02:00.483
I hate Nelson's parties.

02:00.486 --> 02:03.603
He makes you look his baseball cards and tell him they're good.

02:03.617 --> 02:05.423
They're not good.

02:05.427 --> 02:06.592
I don't like him.

02:06.595 --> 02:09.043
I'll bet Nelson won't even have gift bags.

02:09.044 --> 02:11.213
Unthinkable!
Is that legal?

02:11.215 --> 02:14.231
Wait. What if nobody goes?

02:14.236 --> 02:15.913
He can't kill all of us.

02:15.916 --> 02:17.722
He's right. Individually,

02:17.725 --> 02:20.010
we are weak like a single twig.

02:20.087 --> 02:23.981
But as a bundle, we form a mighty faggot.

02:26.585 --> 02:27.893
Well said.

02:27.986 --> 02:30.341
If we all stand together, Nelson's helpless.

02:30.406 --> 02:32.312
Hell, no, we won't show.

02:32.315 --> 02:34.400
Hell, no, we won't show!

02:34.408 --> 02:36.412
Hell, no, we won't show!

02:36.415 --> 02:38.383
Hell, no, I won't mow!

02:38.386 --> 02:41.062
Willy, you're fired with complete loss of pension.

02:41.065 --> 02:41.810
Damn it!

02:42.285 --> 02:45.932
You actually convinced people not to go to Nelson's party?

02:45.935 --> 02:48.140
Yep, he'll be all alone on his birthday.

02:48.156 --> 02:49.863
Oh, I wish I could see it.

02:49.866 --> 02:51.390
Boo-hoo, I'm Nelson.

02:51.396 --> 02:52.811
No one likes me.

02:52.817 --> 02:54.820
Bartholomew J. Simpson,

02:54.837 --> 02:56.762
how can you be so mean?!

02:56.766 --> 02:58.102
What are you going to do about it?

02:59.535 --> 03:00.272
Hey!

03:00.287 --> 03:02.223
I'll whack you with
the whole salad set

03:02.236 --> 03:04.411
if you don't start
thinking about others.

03:04.417 --> 03:06.173
You are going to that party.

03:06.277 --> 03:07.892
Mom, I can't go!

03:07.897 --> 03:09.090
No one else is.

03:09.096 --> 03:10.892
Well, if no one else jumped off

03:10.895 --> 03:13.980
the Empire State Building, would you not jump?

03:16.528 --> 03:17.771
Kind of...

03:17.858 --> 03:19.352
Aw, come on, Bart.

03:19.357 --> 03:21.263
The party will be fun.

03:21.276 --> 03:22.781
Nelson's not bad.

03:22.795 --> 03:25.821
All he needs is a little kindness.

03:26.047 --> 03:27.643
Ha, ha, Haaaa

03:27.648 --> 03:29.493
Lisa, you're never gonna get a husband

03:29.496 --> 03:30.940
by being sarcastic.

03:31.217 --> 03:32.661
All right, no husband.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.163
You're getting a husband!

03:34.167 --> 03:36.231
And you are going to that party.

03:36.747 --> 03:37.183
Hmm? Hmm?!

03:39.616 --> 03:41.132
Dad, don't make me go.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.172
I'll give you a back rub.

03:45.878 --> 03:48.931
Oh, your elbow's like
an angel's kiss,

03:49.156 --> 03:50.301
but you still have to go.

03:50.308 --> 03:51.032
Why?

03:51.235 --> 03:55.143
Son, we all have to do things we don't want to:

03:55.158 --> 03:57.600
like have jobs and families

03:57.607 --> 03:59.081
and responsibilities

03:59.097 --> 04:01.023
and having to be Mr. Funny all the time.

04:01.025 --> 04:03.562
You think I wouldn't rather be living nude in the forest

04:03.566 --> 04:06.831
like some ancient pagan, just dancing around

04:06.838 --> 04:08.593
playing the pan flute?!

04:08.606 --> 04:10.361
And here we are.

04:13.667 --> 04:16.983
Okay, just walk in, say "happy birthday" and get out.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.771
Whoa!

04:20.918 --> 04:22.523
This party doesn't suck.

04:22.728 --> 04:24.570
Pizza, that's a nice touch.

04:27.366 --> 04:29.753
Uh-oh, do I hear a dial tone?

04:29.756 --> 04:31.833
'Cause this party is off the hook!

04:34.105 --> 04:35.043
What up, B?

04:36.778 --> 04:37.421
Um,

04:37.868 --> 04:39.290
happy birthday,
Nelson.

04:40.225 --> 04:42.732
Uh, I know it seems a little quiet.

04:42.737 --> 04:44.590
Must be a lot of traffic today.

04:44.596 --> 04:46.260
Is Highway 88 backed up?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.340
Oh, yeah, it's a parking lot out there.

04:48.348 --> 04:50.813
Of course, that explains everything.

04:50.817 --> 04:52.220
Stupid Highway 88!

04:52.278 --> 04:54.170
Huh?

04:58.876 --> 04:59.841
Whoa!

04:59.848 --> 05:02.253
Hi, kids, my spidey sense is tingling.

05:02.255 --> 05:05.381
Tingling because it's a certain someone's birthday.

05:06.756 --> 05:07.671
Yeah!

05:10.266 --> 05:12.131
Uh, where are all the kids?

05:12.135 --> 05:12.822
They're coming!

05:12.826 --> 05:13.552
They are!

05:14.496 --> 05:16.053
I love you, Spidey!

05:16.148 --> 05:18.932
Uh, listen, I only got ten minutes of material.

05:18.935 --> 05:21.021
Maybe I should come back a little later.

05:21.065 --> 05:21.871
Don't go.

05:21.887 --> 05:23.470
My party peeps are en route,

05:23.476 --> 05:24.562
I swear!

05:28.087 --> 05:29.322
Nelson, nobody's coming.

05:29.836 --> 05:31.813
But how could nobody come?

05:31.877 --> 05:33.380
I ordered them to.

05:33.388 --> 05:35.173
Well, that's the thing.

05:35.317 --> 05:38.691
Sometimes you can be kind of a jerk.

05:38.768 --> 05:40.290
True...

05:40.517 --> 05:43.540
but I thought I had some friends.

05:44.296 --> 05:47.102
Maybe you can have fun with just me.

05:47.177 --> 05:48.032
Okay.

05:48.405 --> 05:49.173
Why not?

05:49.178 --> 05:51.373
Stop having fun, kids.

05:51.375 --> 05:52.993
I'm Dr. Octopus

05:52.998 --> 05:54.820
from Marvel Comics' Spiderman.

05:54.825 --> 05:56.270
I'm inventing a ray

05:56.275 --> 05:57.971
that turns birthday presents

05:57.978 --> 05:59.093
into homework.

05:59.095 --> 06:00.390
Yah!

06:00.405 --> 06:01.060
Come on, Bart.

06:01.104 --> 06:02.321
Let's knock him down.

06:13.733 --> 06:15.218
Wait, I have an idea.

06:22.041 --> 06:23.479
Look at our kids,

06:23.479 --> 06:24.890
playing like champs.

06:24.896 --> 06:27.430
Yeah. How'd you afford this kickass party?

06:27.435 --> 06:29.882
Carnival ride hit me on the head.

06:30.216 --> 06:31.010
Hmm....

06:31.178 --> 06:34.472
So how was Nelson's party?

06:34.516 --> 06:35.323
Not bad.

06:35.336 --> 06:37.763
We had pizza, cake and then sang songs

06:37.767 --> 06:38.953
with Nelson's grandma.

06:38.955 --> 06:41.092
But it was a one-time thing,

06:41.098 --> 06:43.143
and now I'll never see him again.

06:44.258 --> 06:45.190
Hey!

06:45.196 --> 06:46.921
It's my birthday bud!

06:49.205 --> 06:50.710
Yeah, yeah, it was,

06:50.718 --> 06:52.030
uh, super fun.

06:52.035 --> 06:52.952
Good times.

06:52.955 --> 06:53.690
Hey, Ralph,

06:53.698 --> 06:55.803
have I got half a sandwich for you.

06:55.998 --> 06:57.491
Bart, where you going?

06:57.505 --> 06:58.963
I saved you a seat,

06:59.148 --> 07:00.542
best friend.

07:00.557 --> 07:01.131
Wouha!

07:02.117 --> 07:03.450
Ha-ha!

07:05.825 --> 07:07.051
Hey, best friend,

07:07.058 --> 07:08.530
I got you a present.

07:08.547 --> 07:10.932
An entire case of pool cue chalk.

07:11.127 --> 07:12.101
Huh? Huh?

07:12.337 --> 07:15.003
We can make the tip
of anything blue.

07:15.005 --> 07:16.550
Um, Nelson,

07:16.556 --> 07:19.651
I was just thinking about us being best friends.

07:19.657 --> 07:21.601
Whoa! Me, too!

07:21.605 --> 07:23.632
We are so connected!

07:23.817 --> 07:24.902
Look, um,

07:24.975 --> 07:28.262
I don't have time for new friends.

07:28.325 --> 07:29.660
I got a lot on my plate.

07:29.666 --> 07:30.841
I've got a big report due

07:30.858 --> 07:32.481
on the Nile River topic sentence,

07:32.488 --> 07:34.212
bibliography, page numbers

07:34.226 --> 07:35.011
it's nuts.

07:35.857 --> 07:36.920
Dude...

07:37.028 --> 07:39.943
You made me get water on my cheek.

07:44.685 --> 07:46.600
Bart is my best friend now,

07:46.608 --> 07:49.740
which means no one picks on him ever again.

07:51.287 --> 07:52.612
Okay! Okay!

07:52.615 --> 07:54.940
I forgot how cool Bart was.

07:55.368 --> 07:56.280
Yeah, he's awesome.

07:56.286 --> 07:57.261
Good guy, good guy.

07:57.267 --> 07:57.901
Isn't he?

07:57.935 --> 08:00.650
I've known him for years, but I ran into him at a party

08:00.656 --> 08:01.973
and we really clicked.

08:01.986 --> 08:03.943
That's right, we're best friends now.

08:03.946 --> 08:05.802
So why don't you go pick on

08:05.806 --> 08:08.010
someone smaller and weaker?

08:08.018 --> 08:09.041
Good idea!

08:09.045 --> 08:10.913
Let's go over to the Sunshine pre-school

08:10.917 --> 08:12.433
and wail on toddlers.

08:12.437 --> 08:14.630
Yeah, we'll jump 'em while they're napping.

08:16.608 --> 08:17.543
Homie...

08:18.697 --> 08:19.142
Huh...?

08:21.245 --> 08:24.061
When you're done putting Lisa to bed we can, uh...

08:24.165 --> 08:26.823
finish what we started the other day.

08:26.827 --> 08:27.490
Woo-hoo!

08:27.496 --> 08:28.890
Marital sex!

08:29.037 --> 08:29.751
Hi hi hi

08:29.878 --> 08:32.232
Okay, tucked in tight, glass of water,

08:32.236 --> 08:33.972
nightlight on, no barn owls,

08:33.988 --> 08:35.621
don't do drugs, love you, good night.

08:36.255 --> 08:38.821
Dad, can't you read me a story for a little bit?

08:38.826 --> 08:41.683
But your mother smells like coconut.

08:44.027 --> 08:46.440
Okay, sweetie, which book should I read?

08:46.665 --> 08:49.840
Angelica Button and the Dragon King's Trundle Bed.

08:49.845 --> 08:51.070
It's the ninth book in

08:51.075 --> 08:52.551
the Angelica Button series.

08:52.567 --> 08:54.193
Oh, yeah, this is that fantasy book

08:54.195 --> 08:55.601
that even grown-ups like.

08:55.647 --> 08:57.533
Broken, lonely grown-ups.

08:57.996 --> 09:01.561
"Chapter One: The Ruby Stone in the Door-Portal".

09:01.875 --> 09:02.751
Are you asleep yet?

09:02.788 --> 09:03.533
No.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.950
"Angelica trembled

09:06.958 --> 09:10.160
as she looked up at the stern but wise whiskers

09:10.166 --> 09:12.230
of Headmaster Greystash..."

09:13.638 --> 09:15.000
Angelica Button,

09:15.005 --> 09:16.550
you are a mere Earthkin.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.001
What business have you

09:18.005 --> 09:20.040
with the Merlinical Council?

09:20.045 --> 09:21.322
I bring warning!

09:21.325 --> 09:23.601
The Minister of Niceness, Lord Evilton,

09:23.606 --> 09:25.891
is not what he appears!

09:26.176 --> 09:28.821
Preposterous-sss!

09:28.826 --> 09:30.560
Foolish Earthkin!

09:30.565 --> 09:31.791
Send her to the sorrow

09:31.808 --> 09:33.850
mines of Mount Purgatorium.

09:34.385 --> 09:37.310
Nooo!!

09:37.505 --> 09:38.582
Lisa, wake up.

09:38.655 --> 09:40.801
They're taking Angelica
to Mount Purgatorium.

09:41.207 --> 09:43.612
Oh, Dad, I'm tired.

09:43.675 --> 09:45.853
- We read more tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

09:46.058 --> 09:47.303
But she's in trouble now.

09:47.355 --> 09:49.151
I'll just read ahead
without you.

09:49.258 --> 09:52.480
No! We have to read it together.

09:52.537 --> 09:55.253
Oh, of course.
Whatever you say, sweetie.

09:55.267 --> 09:56.251
Nighty-night.

10:08.407 --> 10:11.650
I like to come up here
and make fun of the sunset.

10:11.858 --> 10:14.302
Hey, gas ball, you suck!

10:15.006 --> 10:17.301
Nelson, do you ever
wish you weren't a bully?

10:17.607 --> 10:19.201
Mm, sometimes.

10:19.256 --> 10:22.052
But it's not up to me,
it's who I am.

10:22.107 --> 10:25.653
I mean, a shark can't stop
swimming or it'll blow up.

10:25.955 --> 10:28.953
Man...
I never knew you were so deep.

10:28.955 --> 10:31.101
Here, this is for you.

10:32.505 --> 10:34.000
A Nelson vest!

10:34.105 --> 10:37.023
The sleeves were
torn off by wild dogs.

10:37.328 --> 10:39.682
From then on, my life changed.

10:40.208 --> 10:43.403
<i>He's a rebel and he'll
ever, ever be any good... </i>

10:43.408 --> 10:46.523
All of a sudden, I was a somebody
in a school full of nobodies.

10:46.628 --> 10:48.643
I could go anywhere,
do anything.

10:48.748 --> 10:52.873
For us, to live any
other way was nuts.

10:52.877 --> 10:56.281
<i> That's no reason why I can't
give him all my love </i>

10:56.325 --> 11:00.103
<i> He's always good to me,
always treats me tenderly </i>

11:00.157 --> 11:01.923
<i> 'Cause he's no rebel,
no, no, no </i>

11:02.426 --> 11:06.020
<i> He' rebel,
no, no, no, to me... </i>

11:24.256 --> 11:27.663
So, Scoty, how do you like school?

11:27.765 --> 11:28.661
Closed!

11:31.337 --> 11:33.292
Life was perfect.

11:34.308 --> 11:37.191
Lisa, I'm home.
Time for me to read to you!

11:37.295 --> 11:39.253
Lisa's sleeping
over at Janey's.

11:39.458 --> 11:42.703
Apparently, her mom makes
good mac and cheese.

11:44.555 --> 11:47.902
Homer? Homer.

11:48.658 --> 11:49.880
You must read ahead.

11:49.988 --> 11:51.103
Fiction is your passion!

11:51.105 --> 11:53.972
Lady, you're nice,
but I'm married.

11:53.977 --> 11:56.560
Just read the book, you shaved ape.

11:57.507 --> 12:01.500
Ow! I can't read ahead.
I promised Lisa I wouldn't.

12:01.607 --> 12:06.001
Just take a peek at the title of the
next chapter and see if you can resist.

12:07.358 --> 12:08.782
"An Unexpected Occurrence"?!

12:08.988 --> 12:09.881
What could it be?

12:11.207 --> 12:15.102
- We hooked him, Galahad.
-Yes, quite.

12:15.407 --> 12:19.603
"Angelica was trapped in the
suffoclock of Sandy Doom..."

12:22.008 --> 12:24.900
"...as Headmaster Greystash
fought a battle to the finish

12:24.957 --> 12:28.120
with dark wizard Maluicious Krubb."

12:28.227 --> 12:29.802
Time to choose, Greystash.

12:30.057 --> 12:32.953
If you save Angelica... you die!

12:45.806 --> 12:47.952
Good-bye... Angelica.

12:51.106 --> 12:52.400
Greystash.

12:53.485 --> 12:55.370
He killed Greystash!

12:56.206 --> 12:58.300
Thanks for spoiler the there, big mouth.

13:00.108 --> 13:01.552
- Hey, Bart.
- Milhouse.

13:01.756 --> 13:05.341
Bart, why are you hanging
around with Nelson so much?

13:05.406 --> 13:06.503
He's a bully.

13:06.608 --> 13:08.500
Hey, don't use the
"B" word around me.

13:08.548 --> 13:09.453
It's offensive.

13:09.485 --> 13:11.333
- Yo, bully.
- What up, my bully?

13:12.757 --> 13:14.400
How come they can say it?

13:15.485 --> 13:16.613
They just can, okay?

13:16.688 --> 13:19.782
It's weird to see you
as somebody's sidekick.

13:19.988 --> 13:22.523
Whoa, Bart Simpson is nobody's sidekick.

13:22.585 --> 13:24.603
Then why are you wearing that vest?

13:24.908 --> 13:27.780
Because my chest is cold
and my arms aren't.

13:27.986 --> 13:28.982
I see.

13:28.987 --> 13:32.673
Then i'm suppose you can just
fly kites with whoever you want,

13:32.677 --> 13:35.051
right here in front of everyone.

13:35.156 --> 13:37.501
Come on, Bart.
Throw the dork a bone.

13:38.875 --> 13:40.040
All right, I will.

13:48.208 --> 13:52.051
Blue and red, the colors of friendship.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.433
You're late.

14:02.536 --> 14:04.232
I was waiting
to smash this frog with you,

14:04.236 --> 14:05.351
and it peed in my hand.

14:08.305 --> 14:09.783
Sorry. I was, uh...

14:09.805 --> 14:12.780
- Steal a loose grapeshe grocery store.
- Really?

14:13.085 --> 14:15.862
You call this stealing loose grapes?

14:20.807 --> 14:23.152
We were just having fun.
Don't get upset.

14:23.198 --> 14:25.953
Oh, right. Stupid Nelson always gets upset.

14:26.055 --> 14:27.602
He'll probably do something stupid.

14:27.656 --> 14:29.251
like smash his own camera!

14:31.906 --> 14:33.080
Look what you made me do!

14:35.175 --> 14:36.871
Nelson, get in here!

14:36.956 --> 14:40.043
The cat's eyes are runny,
and I need you to dab 'em.

14:40.106 --> 14:41.231
Coming Ma,

14:41.236 --> 14:44.621
See you later, lying traitor!

14:47.405 --> 14:49.330
Something in your eye, Mr. Mooch?

14:49.937 --> 14:52.652
Well ere's something in my eye, too.

14:56.345 --> 14:57.982
Ma, what happened to the curtains?

14:58.288 --> 15:01.053
I made 'emo a dress
for karaoke singing.

15:01.605 --> 15:03.043
Hey Bart, do you want some ice cream?

15:03.246 --> 15:05.701
I just hit a major marshmallow vein.

15:05.807 --> 15:08.922
Oh! I think it goes
all the way to the bottom.

15:09.025 --> 15:11.153
- No, thanks.
- What's wrong?

15:11.557 --> 15:14.371
Me and Nelson were best friends,
and now I think he's gonna kill me!

15:14.377 --> 15:15.543
Bully problem, eh?

15:15.847 --> 15:18.430
You know what they say
all bullies are cowards.

15:18.635 --> 15:22.170
It's not true-- they're brave,
'cause they're strong.

15:28.698 --> 15:30.483
Bart, we need to talk.

15:32.705 --> 15:35.530
I feel so bad about
freaking out on you.

15:35.637 --> 15:37.702
It'll never happen again, I swear.

15:38.007 --> 15:40.341
Um... okay.

15:40.647 --> 15:43.200
Best friends?
Forever?

15:43.508 --> 15:44.323
No!

15:44.327 --> 15:45.330
I can't do it.

15:45.335 --> 15:47.472
You're a nut bar, a whack job!

15:47.475 --> 15:48.481
A kooka-dooka!

15:48.488 --> 15:50.502
Please, just leave me alone.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.803
- Best not to get involved.
- Agreed.

15:55.807 --> 15:58.343
Looks like you've
made your choice.

15:58.646 --> 16:01.400
Make sure your affairs
are in order.

16:01.405 --> 16:02.673
I've set up a trust.

16:02.678 --> 16:04.683
It bypasses the inheritance tax.

16:04.808 --> 16:07.253
Only till 2008.
Look into it!

16:10.985 --> 16:12.751
Oh, Greystash...

16:13.957 --> 16:15.843
Greystash!

16:15.846 --> 16:16.842
Oh, hello, Lisa.

16:16.985 --> 16:18.802
Come on, Dad, read
the last chapter.

16:18.905 --> 16:20.671
Everyone says there's a big surprise.

16:20.707 --> 16:23.901
I bet Angelica discovers
that she's a wizard.

16:25.205 --> 16:28.691
How would you feel if something
bad happened to Greystash?

16:28.796 --> 16:31.003
It would be the day my childhood ended.

16:31.507 --> 16:32.852
Come on, read, read!

16:35.206 --> 16:39.123
"Angelica was trapped in the
Suffoclock of Sandy Doom..."

16:39.188 --> 16:42.503
Time to choose, Greystash.
If you save Angelica,

16:42.555 --> 16:44.001
you die!

16:45.056 --> 16:45.883
Why are you stopping?

16:45.906 --> 16:47.701
We're almost at the happy ending.

16:49.006 --> 16:51.053
No book is gonna make
my daughter sad.

16:51.357 --> 16:54.951
Time to do what I do best.
Lie to a child!

16:55.156 --> 16:58.241
"Greystash looked Krubb
right in the eye and said..."

16:59.895 --> 17:02.303
Mustache power:
activate!

17:17.435 --> 17:20.853
Oh, man, I can't believe
you beat me, but you did.

17:21.255 --> 17:24.381
I somehow escaped
from the hourglass!

17:26.366 --> 17:28.780
And now, to go on living!

17:35.056 --> 17:36.620
The end.

17:37.908 --> 17:39.620
Is that really how it ends?

17:39.685 --> 17:41.820
What happened to
the Merlinical Council?

17:42.857 --> 17:45.661
They went to Star Wars Land
and fought star wars.

17:45.708 --> 17:48.582
Dad, you can read to me anytime.

17:49.608 --> 17:52.351
Now Lisa won't know
about death till it strikes

17:52.406 --> 17:53.950
someone close to her.

18:04.408 --> 18:05.791
Dad's ending is better.

18:05.966 --> 18:09.503
Okay, field-trippers, welcome to
the Springfield Tide Pools,

18:09.556 --> 18:11.822
nature's most fecund ecosystem.

18:12.026 --> 18:14.202
Who will spot
the playful abalone?

18:14.205 --> 18:15.743
The mighty winkle?

18:16.046 --> 18:18.083
I think it might be you, Sherri.

18:18.958 --> 18:20.983
Now, remember,
these pools can be dangerous,

18:20.997 --> 18:22.503
so everyone pick a buddy.

18:23.658 --> 18:25.030
Bart's my buddy.

18:25.707 --> 18:26.563
Good boy, Nelson.

18:27.007 --> 18:28.400
Squeeze him extra tight for safety.

18:31.906 --> 18:33.753
We sure are far from
the rest of 'em.

18:34.438 --> 18:35.951
Funny how that happened, huh?

18:36.645 --> 18:37.322
Come with me.

18:39.808 --> 18:41.280
Nelson, please don't kill me.

18:41.376 --> 18:43.432
Remember when we made
fun of Cinco de Mayo?

18:43.435 --> 18:44.752
I called it "Stinko de Mayo."

18:44.855 --> 18:45.993
We laughed so hard.

18:46.806 --> 18:47.602
Bart...

18:48.696 --> 18:51.472
you are a bad friend.

18:52.406 --> 18:53.602
S-Say again?

18:53.606 --> 18:55.372
You never liked me for me.

18:55.407 --> 18:58.293
You liked that I protected
you and gave you a vest

18:58.297 --> 19:00.080
and stole milk boxes for you.

19:00.308 --> 19:03.082
I hate milk!
It comes from cow wangs!

19:03.406 --> 19:04.662
There you go again.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.862
You act all nice,
and then you go crazy.

19:06.866 --> 19:09.102
Well, maybe I get jealous.

19:09.307 --> 19:10.540
But it's just because...

19:11.305 --> 19:13.893
I never had a best friend before.

19:17.408 --> 19:20.113
Nelson, was the water
always up to our necks?

19:21.805 --> 19:22.682
Nelson?

19:23.487 --> 19:24.700
Help! Help!

19:24.948 --> 19:27.080
- Put this on.
- Where did you get it?

19:27.097 --> 19:28.131
Dude gave it to me.

19:54.056 --> 19:54.982
Man lips!

19:55.287 --> 19:59.530
Skinner loves Bart!
Skinner loves Bart!

19:59.587 --> 20:02.141
Shut up! I'm just giving him CPR,

20:02.198 --> 20:03.381
the kiss of life.

20:03.407 --> 20:05.372
And if anyone loves Bart, it's Nelson.

20:05.377 --> 20:06.183
Where is Nelson?

20:06.185 --> 20:08.401
I'm sorry, Nelson
never woke up.

20:08.406 --> 20:10.503
- What?!
- Never woke up, because...

20:10.538 --> 20:12.723
he never passed out
he's right over there.

20:16.145 --> 20:17.503
Hey, thanks for saving me, man.

20:17.707 --> 20:20.451
Course I saved you
you're my field trip buddy.

20:20.855 --> 20:23.233
- And nothing else.
- You mean...?

20:23.356 --> 20:25.881
Exactly.
You're barf to me now.

20:37.358 --> 20:38.953
Oh, Nelson...

20:39.006 --> 20:41.752
I'll never forget that week
we were best friends.

20:51.557 --> 20:53.203
I touched your heart!

21:06.525 --> 21:10.632
Greystash! Greystash!

21:11.207 --> 21:13.561
Gee, you're really upset
about this Greystash thing.

21:13.597 --> 21:14.872
Don't say his name.

21:15.277 --> 21:17.403
In your mouth,
it sounds like dirt!

21:17.456 --> 21:19.050
Homer, it's just a book.

21:19.106 --> 21:22.281
No man should outlive
his fictional wizard.

21:22.387 --> 21:23.483
No man!
