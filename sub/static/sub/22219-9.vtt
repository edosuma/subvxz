29:49.468 --> 29:51.836

29:51.837 --> 29:53.404

<b>some issues</b>

29:53.405 --> 29:54.505
<b>with your gray.</b>

29:54.506 --> 29:56.240
<b> <i>It looks really patchy</i> </b>
<b> <i>all throughout.</i> </b>

29:56.241 --> 29:58.276
<b> <i>It has a very grainy look</i> </b>
<b> <i>to a lot of it,</i> </b>

29:58.277 --> 30:00.745
<b>and you chose to do</b>
<b>a lot of circular shapes,</b>

30:00.746 --> 30:02.914
<b> <i>and none of the mechanisms</i> </b>
<b> <i>really tie in together.</i> </b>

30:02.915 --> 30:05.583
<b>They're all just kind of</b>
<b>overlapping.</b>

30:05.584 --> 30:06.651
<b>- Nate.</b>

30:06.652 --> 30:08.152
<b>- When you first glance</b>

<b> <i>It has that wow factor,</i> </b>

30:10.222 --> 30:12.356

30:13.725 --> 30:15.760

30:15.761 --> 30:18.729

30:18.730 --> 30:21.032
<b>- Sketchy, come on down.</b>

30:21.033 --> 30:22.800
<b>- All right, Nate,</b>
<b>one of the weirdest things</b>

30:22.801 --> 30:24.468
<b> <i>about this whole design</i> </b>
<b> <i>is the eyebrow</i> </b>

30:24.469 --> 30:26.504
<b> <i>just crashing into the eyelid.</i> </b>

30:26.505 --> 30:28.472
<b>That has a strange look.</b>

30:28.473 --> 30:30.741
<b> <i>It confuses me about</i> </b>
<b> <i>the direction of the eye.</i> </b>

30:30.742 --> 30:32.176
<b>- The reference</b>
<b>went straight down.</b>

30:32.177 --> 30:33.611

<b> <i>- There's no way in hell</i> </b>
<b> <i>that that eyebrow</i> </b>

30:35.347 --> 30:36.981
<b> <i>is laying on your eyelid.</i> </b>

30:36.982 --> 30:38.716
<b>I feel like this one</b>
<b>got away from you.</b>

30:38.717 --> 30:39.717
<b>- Sketchy.</b>

30:39.718 --> 30:41.118
<b> <i>- As far as adaptability goes,</i> </b>

30:41.119 --> 30:42.653
<b> <i>your canvas had a crazy idea.</i> </b>

30:42.654 --> 30:44.956
<b>You simplified it.</b>
<b>I think it's the easy way out.</b>

30:44.957 --> 30:46.290
<b>- I tried to adapt, man.</b>

30:46.291 --> 30:48.693
<b> <i>- There is a lot</i> </b>
<b> <i>of sketchy outlines in this.</i> </b>

30:48.694 --> 30:49.794
<b> <i>This tattoo, right now,</i> </b>

30:49.795 --> 30:51.996
<b>puts you in a very</b>
<b>vulnerable spot.</b>

30:51.997 --> 30:55.266
<b>- Frankly, this head doesn't</b>
<b>really seem to work together.</b>

30:55.267 --> 30:57.135
<b>- This one, for me, is a draw.</b>

31:00.272 --> 31:03.241
<b>- Let's bring down Kelly.</b>

31:03.242 --> 31:05.476
<b>- Well, Sketchy, this is more</b>
<b>the guy that I know.</b>

31:05.477 --> 31:08.346
<b> <i>These lines... nice and strong.</i> </b>
<b> <i>It's solid.</i> </b>

31:08.347 --> 31:09.647
<b> <i>It's bright.</i> </b> <b> <i>It's vibrant.</i> </b>

31:09.648 --> 31:11.148
<b>The colors play off</b>
<b>of each other.</b>

31:11.149 --> 31:12.984
<b>- I'm not a big fan of the way</b>
<b>it fits on her ear,</b>

31:12.985 --> 31:15.486
<b>but this strong, crisp outline</b>
<b>is what you needed</b>

31:15.487 --> 31:17.321
<b>in that "Family" tattoo.</b>
<b>- Kelly.</b>

31:17.322 --> 31:18.756
<b>- Aesthetically,</b>
<b>right off the bat,</b>

31:18.757 --> 31:20.524
<b> <i>it's a beautiful tattoo.</i> </b>
<b> <i>Brightly colored,</i> </b>

31:20.525 --> 31:21.525
<b> <i>great color palette.</i> </b>

<b>Sketchy's fits the head.</b>

31:26.331 --> 31:27.798
<b> <i>It has some breathability</i> </b>
<b> <i>and it doesn't look</i> </b>

31:27.799 --> 31:29.133

31:29.134 --> 31:31.636
<b>- Between the two,</b>
<b>I lean towards Kelly on these.</b>

31:31.637 --> 31:33.438
<b>- I'm going with Kelly.</b>
<b>- Cool.</b>

31:34.973 --> 31:36.607
<b>- Kelly, your canvas tapped out,</b>

31:36.608 --> 31:38.276
<b>so you just have the one side</b>

31:38.277 --> 31:39.744
<b> <i>on this canvas to talk about.</i> </b>

31:39.745 --> 31:42.213
<b> <i>- The area where you have</i> </b>
<b> <i>the biggest issue</i> </b>

31:42.214 --> 31:45.349
<b>is making something this big</b>
<b>on the side of her head.</b>

31:45.350 --> 31:47.985
<b> <i>- You have all these</i> </b>
<b> <i>multiple tones</i> </b>

31:47.986 --> 31:49.887
<b>and blends of different colors,</b>

31:49.888 --> 31:52.556
<b>tattooing over the same area</b>
<b>three times.</b>

31:52.557 --> 31:54.292
<b>Of course it's gonna hurt</b>
<b>real bad.</b>

31:54.293 --> 31:55.793
<b>That sits negatively</b>
<b>against you.</b>

31:55.794 --> 31:58.729
<b>You've got to be able to work</b>
<b>the whole challenge.</b>

31:58.730 --> 32:01.832
<b>- Ryan and Eric.</b>

32:01.833 --> 32:03.301
<b>- Ryan, I really like</b>
<b>this tattoo.</b>

32:03.302 --> 32:04.835
<b> <i>I think you definitely</i> </b>
<b> <i>used contrast</i> </b>

32:04.836 --> 32:07.438
<b> <i>to put depth in this</i> </b>
<b> <i>to make the skin and gears</i> </b>

32:07.439 --> 32:09.173
<b> <i>and tools look like</i> </b>
<b> <i>they're overlapping,</i> </b>

32:09.174 --> 32:11.409
<b>and the detail is very nice.</b>

32:11.410 --> 32:12.410
<b>- Eric.</b>

32:12.411 --> 32:13.844
<b>- The style of the rips</b>

32:13.845 --> 32:15.413
<b>really match up nicely.</b>

32:15.414 --> 32:16.647
<b> <i>You followed the same flow</i> </b>

32:16.648 --> 32:18.282
<b> <i>on the front of his head</i> </b>
<b> <i>as Ryan did.</i> </b>

32:18.283 --> 32:20.384
<b> <i>I think you guys</i> </b>
<b> <i>worked really well together.</i> </b>

32:20.385 --> 32:23.154
<b>- Ryan and Eric, you guys picked</b>
<b>each other's canvases.</b>

32:23.155 --> 32:24.889
<b>Let's start off with Eric.</b>

32:24.890 --> 32:26.791
<b>- Eric, I love</b>
<b>this floating figure</b>

32:26.792 --> 32:27.925
<b> <i>that you have in the center.</i> </b>

32:27.926 --> 32:29.660
<b> <i>Then the color trickles off</i> </b>

32:29.661 --> 32:30.995
<b> <i>into this gnarly pattern.</i> </b>

32:30.996 --> 32:32.330
<b> <i>It looks great.</i> </b>

32:32.331 --> 32:34.165
<b>What I love about the way</b>
<b>these two tattoos</b>

32:34.166 --> 32:35.666
<b>tie together is the fact</b>
<b>that, Eric,</b>

32:35.667 --> 32:38.436
<b>you created that beautiful,</b>
<b>floating geometric shape,</b>

32:38.437 --> 32:40.104
<b> <i>and it looks like</i> </b>
<b> <i>that's the light</i> </b>

32:40.105 --> 32:41.939
<b> <i>that's backlit on Ryan's tattoo.</i> </b>

32:41.940 --> 32:43.107
<b>- Ryan.</b>

32:43.108 --> 32:44.842
<b>- The layout</b>
<b>and the artistry here</b>

32:44.843 --> 32:46.110
<b> <i>showed adaptability.</i> </b>

32:46.111 --> 32:48.145

<b>came out super strong.</b>

32:48.146 --> 32:49.447

<b> <i>and that Ryan finished,</i> </b>

<b> <i>out of these two,</i> </b>

32:52.017 --> 32:53.784

<b>but out of the head</b>

32:53.785 --> 32:55.586
<b>that Ryan started</b>
<b>and Eric finished,</b>

32:55.587 --> 32:57.288
<b>the winner I would pick is Ryan.</b>

32:57.289 --> 32:58.456

32:58.457 --> 33:00.124

<b>for the win.</b>

33:15.741 --> 33:17.008
<b>It's my team versus your team.</b>

33:17.009 --> 33:18.709
<b>- One person gets to win.</b>

33:18.710 --> 33:20.645

<b>Eric's creativity,</b>
<b>consistency, and flow</b>

33:23.482 --> 33:26.350

<b>were much nicer.</b>

33:26.351 --> 33:27.652

36:09.334 --> 36:10.534

36:18.076 --> 36:21.879

36:21.880 --> 36:23.714

36:23.715 --> 36:25.082

36:37.229 --> 36:38.629
<b>Based on your work,</b>

36:38.630 --> 36:41.332

36:41.333 --> 36:43.601
<b>This decision is far from made.</b>

36:48.039 --> 36:49.273
<b>Nate.</b>

36:49.274 --> 36:51.709

36:51.710 --> 36:53.344
<b> <i>as eye-catching and dramatic,</i> </b>

36:53.345 --> 36:55.246

<b>are not all clean</b>
<b>or why they don't make sense.</b>

36:59.818 --> 37:01.852
<b>- I guarantee you I can show you</b>
<b>clean line work.</b>

37:01.853 --> 37:03.420
<b>- But then you did</b>
<b>the second tattoo,</b>

37:03.421 --> 37:05.856
<b>and the only place that you had</b>
<b>to do clean line work</b>

37:05.857 --> 37:07.491
<b> <i>was in the belt buckle,</i> </b>

37:09.694 --> 37:12.062
<b>- My tattoos,</b>

37:12.063 --> 37:14.131
<b>I definitely don't think</b>
<b>I deserve this.</b>

37:14.132 --> 37:16.734
<b>- Mike, if we're looking</b>
<b>at gears, teeth have to fit.</b>

37:16.735 --> 37:18.936
<b> <i>It just doesn't play properly</i> </b>
<b> <i>to what a gear looks like.</i> </b>

37:18.937 --> 37:20.604
<b>Those are things that count</b>
<b>at this point.</b>

37:20.605 --> 37:22.239
<b>- I got no excuses</b>
<b>for the gears,</b>

37:22.240 --> 37:24.175
<b>but with the Statue of Liberty,</b>
<b>I was happy.</b>

37:24.176 --> 37:25.943
<b> <i>- Well, I think</i> </b>
<b> <i>when you get to the statue,</i> </b>

37:25.944 --> 37:28.078
<b> <i>your mouth's definitely</i> </b>
<b> <i>to the right.</i> </b>

37:28.079 --> 37:29.280
<b> <i>There's no two buildings</i> </b>

37:29.281 --> 37:31.382
<b> <i>that are exactly perpendicular</i> </b>
<b> <i>to each other.</i> </b>

37:31.383 --> 37:33.484
<b>These tattoos have</b>
<b>a lot of problems.</b>

37:33.485 --> 37:34.819
<b>- Let's move on to Sketchy.</b>

37:34.820 --> 37:36.287
<b>- I know there's been some talk</b>
<b>in the room</b>

37:36.288 --> 37:37.755
<b>that people that do</b>
<b>like the mandala,</b>

37:37.756 --> 37:39.123
<b>but I have to say it, man.</b>

37:39.124 --> 37:40.291
<b> <i>I just feel like it's weak.</i> </b>

37:40.292 --> 37:42.026
<b> <i>I do see line work problems.</i> </b>

37:42.027 --> 37:44.128
<b> <i>There's even some lines</i> </b>
<b> <i>in the leaves</i> </b>

37:44.129 --> 37:45.663
<b> <i>that's going completely</i> </b>
<b> <i>the wrong way</i> </b>

37:45.664 --> 37:47.031
<b> <i>compared to all</i> </b>
<b> <i>the other leaves,</i> </b>

37:47.032 --> 37:48.933
<b>which is weird.</b>

37:48.934 --> 37:50.401
<b> <i>But, man, this "Family" thing</i> </b>

37:50.402 --> 37:51.802
<b> <i>is hard for me to swallow.</i> </b>

37:51.803 --> 37:53.637
<b> <i>That Y, the way it goes</i> </b>
<b> <i>over the ear...</i> </b>

37:53.638 --> 37:54.805
<b>out of sorts.</b>

37:54.806 --> 37:56.807
<b>The skull with just</b>
<b>no interaction</b>

37:56.808 --> 37:58.742
<b> <i>between the family,</i> </b>
<b> <i>just popped there...</i> </b>

37:58.743 --> 38:00.211
<b>- I felt more comfortable</b>
<b>doing this</b>

38:00.212 --> 38:02.680
<b>than a tree</b>
<b>and all those crazy ideas.</b>

38:02.681 --> 38:03.948
<b>I was confident in it.</b>

38:03.949 --> 38:05.382
<b>- That's kind of my concern.</b>

38:05.383 --> 38:07.751
<b>You were cruising,</b>
<b>and you got really comfortable</b>

38:07.752 --> 38:09.787
<b>'cause you didn't feel like</b>
<b>your ass was on the line.</b>

38:09.788 --> 38:11.055
<b>- I don't know, man.</b>

38:11.056 --> 38:12.723
<b>- When you look at what</b>
<b>the field was doing,</b>

38:12.724 --> 38:14.558
<b>there's a lot of strong artwork</b>
<b>out there,</b>

38:14.559 --> 38:17.061
<b>and you needed to be</b>
<b>as strong as them on paper,</b>

38:17.062 --> 38:18.796
<b>and these were just</b>
<b>really big and simple.</b>

38:18.797 --> 38:21.565
<b>- I do script all the time,</b>
<b>man, and it's good.</b>

38:21.566 --> 38:23.468
<b>This time it just wasn't.</b>

38:25.103 --> 38:26.303
<b>- All right, guys.</b>

38:26.304 --> 38:28.239
<b>Time to decide who's going home.</b>

38:28.240 --> 38:29.907
<b>- The one worst tattoo</b>
<b>of the day,</b>

38:29.908 --> 38:31.308
<b>100%, hands-down,</b>

38:31.309 --> 38:32.710
<b>is the "Family."</b> <b>- For sure.</b>

38:32.711 --> 38:33.978
<b>- Well, I thought we were</b>
<b>averaging the two.</b>

38:33.979 --> 38:35.446
<b>- But I don't like</b>
<b>the mandala either.</b>

38:35.447 --> 38:38.382
<b>- What's a better tattoo,</b>
<b>the mandala or the eye?</b>

38:38.383 --> 38:39.550
<b> <i>I'd take the mandala.</i> </b>

38:39.551 --> 38:41.385
<b> <i>The mandala or the gears?</i> </b>

38:41.386 --> 38:42.620
<b> <i>I'd take the mandala.</i> </b>

38:42.621 --> 38:44.688
<b>Between the mandala</b>
<b>and the statue,</b>

38:44.689 --> 38:47.158
<b>I'd take the mandala</b>
<b>because it's cleaner.</b>

38:47.159 --> 38:48.859
<b>- But you can't take</b>
<b>that "Family"</b>

38:48.860 --> 38:51.195
<b>and put it up against</b>
<b>the Statue of Liberty</b>

38:51.196 --> 38:53.497
<b> <i>or the belt buckle.</i> </b>

38:53.498 --> 38:55.032
<b>- But I would rather</b>
<b>have "Family" on me</b>

38:55.033 --> 38:56.167
<b>than that big eye.</b>

38:56.168 --> 38:58.035
<b>- You put that "Family"</b>
<b>next to that eye...</b>

38:58.036 --> 39:00.671
<b> <i>- Go for it.</i> </b>
<b> <i>- That "Family" looks [bleep].</i> </b>

39:00.672 --> 39:02.406
<b>- "Family" is worse</b>
<b>than the eye?</b>

39:02.407 --> 39:03.541
<b>No way.</b> <b>- Technically, yes.</b>

39:03.542 --> 39:05.709
<b>- The eyebrow that goes</b>
<b>into your eye...</b>

39:05.710 --> 39:07.378
<b>who has an eyebrow</b>
<b>that goes into your eye?</b>

39:07.379 --> 39:09.046
<b>- I think they're all</b>
<b>scared of me.</b>

39:09.047 --> 39:10.481
<b>- How in the world would we...</b>
<b>- Plain as day.</b>

39:10.482 --> 39:12.349
<b>- Be scared if you're</b>
<b>in the bottom again?</b>

39:12.350 --> 39:14.285
<b>- The only reason</b>
<b>you would want to vote me off</b>

39:14.286 --> 39:16.854
<b>is 'cause you're scared.</b>

39:16.855 --> 39:19.957
<b>- I think that the "Family"</b>
<b>is the worst tat of the day.</b>

39:19.958 --> 39:21.892
<b>- I don't like the "Family"</b>
<b>at all, but I feel like,</b>

39:21.893 --> 39:23.928
<b>if you average the "Family"</b>
<b>with the mandala,</b>

39:23.929 --> 39:25.596
<b>that puts him in the lead.</b>

39:25.597 --> 39:27.498
<b>- Listen.</b>
<b>If I go two for two for two,</b>

39:27.499 --> 39:30.434
<b>then Mike's two average</b>
<b>falls shorter.</b>

39:30.435 --> 39:33.237
<b>- You're right.</b>

39:33.238 --> 39:35.239
<b>Oliver, final decision?</b>

39:35.240 --> 39:36.907
<b>- I vote for Sketchy.</b>

39:36.908 --> 39:39.109
<b>- Nate's got some wow factor</b>
<b>with the flag.</b>

39:39.110 --> 39:41.312
<b>The mandala is light-years</b>

39:41.313 --> 39:43.380
<b>above the gears and the eye.</b>

39:43.381 --> 39:46.183
<b>Mike has two mediocre tattoos.</b>

39:46.184 --> 39:47.718
<b>I vote Mike.</b>

39:47.719 --> 39:49.587
<b>Chris?</b> <b>- Mike.</b>

39:53.325 --> 39:54.825
