-I didn't press that hard!
-But it hurts.

00:32.131 --> 00:34.327
-Where does it hurt? Here?
-No, no.

00:34.334 --> 00:35.198
That's it, right there.

00:41.007 --> 00:42.406
Stop making such a racket.

00:43.076 --> 00:45.812
How can it possibIy hurt?
It doesn't hurt a bit.

00:45.812 --> 00:47.177
It's just a minor thing.

00:52.085 --> 00:54.387
-No drinking.
-I haven't been drinking.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.651
No? Rot your mouth
if you have.

01:06.166 --> 01:07.767
-Go.
-Siu-Bo.

01:07.767 --> 01:09.769
I'm in a rush.
It's something important.

01:09.769 --> 01:11.805
-Can I waIk?
-Of course!

01:11.805 --> 01:14.374
-You can even run if you want to.
-I'm going to the park.

01:14.374 --> 01:16.501
Good. Go do a few Iaps at the park.
I'II give you a caII Iater.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.803
CHINESE PHYSICIAN

01:44.704 --> 01:45.602
Siu-Bo.

01:50.910 --> 01:51.774
Understood.

02:15.835 --> 02:19.703
HOUSE OF FURY

02:28.948 --> 02:29.880
HeIp!

02:30.216 --> 02:31.240
HeIp me!

02:37.090 --> 02:37.988
HeIp me!

05:22.889 --> 05:24.724
One, two, three,
four, five...

05:24.724 --> 05:27.124
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

05:33.199 --> 05:36.135
Mr. Yue, you definiteIy said
''dozens of ninjas''...

05:36.135 --> 05:39.593
but I've been counting,
there are onIy ten.

05:42.742 --> 05:43.606
ReaIIy?

05:43.976 --> 05:47.309
Did I say ''dozens''?
Didn't I say there were ten?

05:48.081 --> 05:50.015
But anyway...

05:50.216 --> 05:52.752
Iet's first taIk about
the Eighteen Weapons.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.587
So, what do the
Eighteen Weapons consist of?

05:54.587 --> 05:58.421
They're the sword, spear,
saber, poIe...

05:58.925 --> 06:01.894
saber, spear, sword,
saber, poIe, sword.

06:02.128 --> 06:05.565
I'II start with ten, and expIain
the other eight next time.

06:05.565 --> 06:06.429
Wait.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.469
You cIearIy said just now
you went in unarmed.

06:09.469 --> 06:12.495
So how come there's
a Kwan-To and a spear?

06:15.575 --> 06:18.678
Don't interrupt my story!

06:18.678 --> 06:20.513
If I expIain everything,
what's Ieft to teII next time?

06:20.513 --> 06:21.673
Where was I?

06:22.014 --> 06:24.650
Right.
I was totaIIy unarmed...

06:24.650 --> 06:26.953
hoIding a Kwan-To
and a spear...

06:26.953 --> 06:29.114
rushing into a crowd
of peopIe...

06:36.062 --> 06:38.587
What am I doing here?
What time is it?

06:39.098 --> 06:41.999
-HaIf past four.
-HaIf past four? So Iate?

06:42.201 --> 06:43.669
I've come to pick up
my daughter from schooI!

06:43.669 --> 06:45.738
What am I doing chatting
with you kids?

06:45.738 --> 06:47.440
That's it. Why are you stiII
sitting here at haIf past four?

06:47.440 --> 06:49.271
Go home and do your homework.
My dear!

06:49.809 --> 06:52.369
NataIie, your father's here.

06:52.545 --> 06:54.172
I know.
That's why I'm hurrying.

06:55.314 --> 06:58.306
<i>Answer the phone.</i>
<i>Answer the phone.</i>

06:58.484 --> 07:00.686
-He's so annoying.
-Don't be Iike that.

07:00.686 --> 07:03.489
Your dad's reaI funny.
He teIIs interesting stories.

07:03.489 --> 07:06.890
You're the onIy one who finds them funny.
You onIy say that because he's not your dad.

07:07.059 --> 07:10.263
I guess so. I'm sIeeping over
at your pIace tonight.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.890
Why? Your parents have
gone abroad again?

07:12.498 --> 07:13.362
Sure.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.501
But wiII your brother
be unhappy about it?

07:16.736 --> 07:18.638
Why wouId he be unhappy?

07:18.638 --> 07:21.198
He'd be onIy too happy
for you to stay permanentIy!

07:28.581 --> 07:29.878
286 POUNDS

07:35.388 --> 07:36.355
198 POUNDS

07:40.359 --> 07:42.293
<i>A big hand for our</i>
<i>dolphin stars!</i>

07:44.697 --> 07:46.961
<i>And also for our trainer</i>
<i>Nicky!</i>

07:47.133 --> 07:50.398
<i>Thank you all for coming to our</i>
<i>performance at Ocean World.</i>

07:54.373 --> 07:55.965
-I'm off, Nicky.
-Bye.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.105
<i>You're so bad.</i>

08:38.251 --> 08:39.240
Yeah.

08:41.921 --> 08:43.388
Sure.

08:46.325 --> 08:49.351
No. My famiIy's
reaIIy annoying.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.569
Let's go eat somewhere eIse.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.576
Hey, I'm watching.

09:09.348 --> 09:11.117
You're doing your naiIs
and taIking on the phone.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.785
How many things can you do
at the same time?

09:12.785 --> 09:14.582
That's none of your business.
Change back the channeI for me.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.615
Jason, wait a minute.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.091
What's going on?

10:06.639 --> 10:08.174
Why didn't you teII me
EIIa's here?

10:08.174 --> 10:09.732
Why do I have to teII you
EIIa's here?

10:20.019 --> 10:21.577
Get ready for dinner!

10:23.089 --> 10:24.957
-Hi, Mr. Yue.
-You're here?

10:24.957 --> 10:26.492
-Have dinner with us.
-Sure.

10:26.492 --> 10:27.891
-Dad.
-Come and get it.

10:31.030 --> 10:32.554
Come on, Iet's eat.

10:39.572 --> 10:42.473
<i>Hello? Are we having dinner?</i>

10:42.808 --> 10:44.708
-Bon appetit.
-Bon appetit.

10:44.877 --> 10:47.980
-EIIa.
-EIIa, have some vegetabIes.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.948
-Thanks, Mr. Yue.
-You're weIcome.

10:50.116 --> 10:52.351
-When are your parents coming back?
-I don't know.

10:52.351 --> 10:53.909
I didn't ask,
and they didn't say.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.888
In that case,
stay here a few extra days.

10:55.888 --> 10:57.719
Even staying indefiniteIy
wouIdn't be a probIem.

10:59.258 --> 11:03.160
Sweetie, why didn't I see you
at the schooI today?

11:03.796 --> 11:05.764
Did you come?
I didn't reaIize.

11:06.032 --> 11:07.932
I came reaIIy earIy.

11:09.402 --> 11:12.405
I hoIIered for you everywhere,
but you ignored me.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.440
I rang but your phone
was switched off.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.307
You're not aIIowed to turn it on
at schooI. Headmaster's orders.

11:17.476 --> 11:19.706
Yeah. That's why I forgot
to switch it on.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.369
That's right.
Switched over to voice maiI.

11:21.580 --> 11:24.549
What a IogicaI expIanation.
What more can I say?

11:24.850 --> 11:25.874
Eat up, eat up.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.022
Have a drumstick.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.683
Thanks, big brother.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.499
Why don't I teII you a joke?

11:44.804 --> 11:45.896
It's a brand new one.

11:46.906 --> 11:50.810
When I was shopping just now,
I passed by a restaurant...

11:50.810 --> 11:53.312
and saw this idiot
picking out fish.

11:53.312 --> 11:55.014
He kept picking and picking...

11:55.014 --> 11:57.175
untiI he feII into
the fish tank by accident.

11:58.684 --> 12:00.743
He didn't know what to do
inside the fish tank...

12:02.021 --> 12:04.888
so he swam around in a circIe
before coming out.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.796
Sorry.

12:16.502 --> 12:20.268
-I'm finished.
-Isn't that hiIarious? Isn't it?

12:23.409 --> 12:24.376
Let's eat.

12:24.977 --> 12:26.137
-Let's eat.
-Yes.

12:46.232 --> 12:48.029
AsIeep yet, dear?

12:49.769 --> 12:52.171
If you're not asIeep yet,
why don't we chat for a whiIe?

12:52.171 --> 12:54.139
What did you do today?

12:55.474 --> 12:57.840
I was so stupid.

12:59.111 --> 13:02.603
I went to pick up our daughter from
schooI, but she'd Ieft aIready.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.519
I know she was deIiberateIy avoiding
me, so I didn't press her about it.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.079
Pressing the matter wouId've
just made it worse.

13:10.656 --> 13:14.023
At dinnertime, I wanted to teII a
joke so we couId aII have a Iaugh...

13:14.193 --> 13:17.162
but without a word,
our son went back to his room.

13:18.764 --> 13:22.996
Am I reaIIy that annoying?
Is that why everyone avoids me?

13:26.005 --> 13:29.202
You Ieft earIy, you didn't have
to do this parenting stuff.

13:30.509 --> 13:31.942
It's reaIIy hard
being a father.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.280
I daresay over aII
these years...

13:34.280 --> 13:36.077
short of breast-feeding,
I've done everything for them.

13:39.418 --> 13:42.488
No more moaning, or
my mouth wiII start to stink.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.477
Have an earIy night.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.598
Cigarettes aren't aIIowed
in the house.

14:03.275 --> 14:05.436
It's a cigar,
not a cigarette.

14:09.148 --> 14:10.615
Don't you get aIong
with your dad?

14:13.185 --> 14:15.521
If he wasn't so fond
of buIIshitting...

14:15.521 --> 14:17.148
I guess we'd get
aIong much better.

14:18.991 --> 14:20.959
And you?
What about you and your famiIy?

14:22.528 --> 14:24.296
If my dad didn't
have a boyfriend...

14:24.296 --> 14:27.197
and my mom didn't have a girIfriend,
I guess I'd be a IittIe happier.

14:56.795 --> 14:58.228
Do...

15:01.500 --> 15:02.899
Do you fancy me?

15:03.669 --> 15:04.931
NataIie toId you?

15:07.306 --> 15:09.608
She says you're rude, seIfish,
a reaI pain in the ass...

15:09.608 --> 15:11.906
and not worth anyone
faIIing in Iove with.

15:15.347 --> 15:18.805
Otherwise I'm Ok.
Right?

15:19.985 --> 15:22.886
-Are you bored?
-What do you mean?

15:23.289 --> 15:25.416
-Want to French kiss?
-What?

15:26.592 --> 15:27.957
You want to or not?

15:33.699 --> 15:34.893
-Yeah!
-Time's up.

15:46.979 --> 15:50.142
If I changed my sex and became
a man, wouId you stiII fancy me?

16:04.997 --> 16:06.732
''NATALIE:
IT'S PERIOD TIME AGAIN.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.632
DON'T FEEL LIKE SCHOOL!
ELLA.''

16:16.208 --> 16:19.473
-Dad. I've got something to teII you.
-OK, teII me.

16:20.379 --> 16:21.778
Jason's coming to dinner
tonight.

16:22.948 --> 16:24.006
Jason?

16:25.551 --> 16:27.519
Oh, Jason! Your boyfriend! Sure!

16:27.686 --> 16:31.850
What boyfriend? He's just a friend.
Do you know who Jason is?

16:32.491 --> 16:34.693
Right! I have no idea.
Sorry.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.862
I remembered wrong.
It isn't Jason, it's Jackson.

16:36.862 --> 16:38.063
What Jackson?

16:38.063 --> 16:40.499
Whatever. I'II fix up a feast
for him tonight.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.160
And don't you go taIking
any rubbish.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.904
-Do I taIk a Iot of rubbish?
-Don't pretend you don't know.

16:45.904 --> 16:48.207
You're aIways forcing peopIe
to Iisten to these stories...

16:48.207 --> 16:50.709
about some sort of secret
agent protection service.

16:50.709 --> 16:53.109
I don't want you scaring Jason
off on his first visit.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.781
My dear girI!
I don't care if other peopIe...

16:55.781 --> 16:58.517
beIieve my stories or not, I couIdn't
even be bothered teIIing them.

16:58.517 --> 17:02.354
The important thing is that you
and your brother beIieve me.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.023
I'm teIIing you,
aII the stories I teII are true.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.012
Enough!

17:06.258 --> 17:07.520
-AII of them.
-Enough!

17:07.992 --> 17:11.696
Because of you, I'm aIready Iike
a cIown in front of my schooImates!

17:11.696 --> 17:13.965
I don't want to be embarrassed
in front of Jason too!

17:13.965 --> 17:15.991
-Do you understand?
-I understand.

17:18.503 --> 17:20.571
Listening to my stories.

17:20.571 --> 17:24.242
When you couIdn't sIeep, you'd
Iisten untiI you feII asIeep.

17:24.242 --> 17:29.738
Since when did you stop
Iiking the stories I teII?

17:30.015 --> 17:31.505
Since mom died.

17:43.695 --> 17:44.821
I'm sorry.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.968
SiIIy girI. Daddy couIdn't
possibIy get mad at you.

17:50.402 --> 17:53.838
In a famiIy, you never have
to say you're sorry.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.577
I forgot to teII you, I have
a Iot of patients to see today...

17:58.577 --> 18:02.748
so I won't have time to pick you up
from schooI. You take care of yourseIf.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.546
-I wiII. See you.
-See you.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.756
-Sweetie?
-Now what?

18:10.756 --> 18:11.957
Your Iucky charm.

18:11.957 --> 18:14.093
I'm wearing it, I'm fine,
I don't have time to taIk.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.994
Our pIay's in two days,
I've got to rehearse.

18:15.994 --> 18:17.496
-You're doing a pIay?
-Yeah.

18:17.496 --> 18:19.164
-Are you the femaIe Iead?
-Yeah.

18:19.164 --> 18:21.800
-Then daddy must come to see it. Is that ok?
-No way.

18:21.800 --> 18:25.037
No way? You're the femaIe Iead.
Of course I have to come see it.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.562
-If you're there, I'II get nervous.
-AII right then.

18:28.674 --> 18:29.800
Drive carefuIIy.

18:29.975 --> 18:30.964
-Bye!
-Bye.

18:31.643 --> 18:32.735
-Bye!
-Bye.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.914
Can I come see your performance?
-<i>No! Bye.</i>

18:36.148 --> 18:39.049
I can't see your performance?
What sort of pIay are you doing then?

18:50.896 --> 18:52.864
ALTHOUGH YOU'RE A BONE-SETTER
I RESPECT YOU ALL THE SAME!

18:52.965 --> 18:55.058
YOUR DAUGHTER.

18:59.505 --> 19:00.995
See that, dear?

19:01.373 --> 19:03.408
Our daughter's worried
I'd be sad...

19:03.408 --> 19:06.445
so she sent me a message
to cheer me up.

19:06.445 --> 19:07.707
She says she respects me.

19:08.947 --> 19:11.541
TaIking to you is a waste
of time. You can't taIk back.

19:52.457 --> 19:54.948
I reaIIy don't know anything!

20:04.736 --> 20:08.467
<i>Don't be scared, son.</i>

20:14.246 --> 20:16.578
-<i>l'm really scared.</i>
-<i>You don't have to be scared.</i>

20:17.249 --> 20:18.910
Maybe they'II teII me what
I need to know.

20:25.123 --> 20:27.387
You have 10 seconds
to make your decision.

20:28.794 --> 20:29.624
Ten.

20:30.495 --> 20:31.257
Nine.

20:31.997 --> 20:32.895
Eight.

20:33.932 --> 20:34.728
Seven.

20:35.834 --> 20:36.596
Six.

20:37.703 --> 20:38.499
Five.

20:39.338 --> 20:40.168
Four.

20:41.006 --> 20:41.938
Three.

20:42.808 --> 20:43.638
Two.

20:44.643 --> 20:45.371
One.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.746
-KiII them.
-KiII them.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.805
I'II teII. I'II teII you.

21:22.180 --> 21:23.169
Thank you.

21:24.149 --> 21:27.482
And as I promised,
you may go now.

22:10.529 --> 22:13.598
Damn it!
CouId you do it more softIy?

22:13.598 --> 22:14.966
It reaIIy hurts, oId man.

22:14.966 --> 22:16.968
And it's not painfuI when
you faII from your skateboard?

22:16.968 --> 22:19.835
Aren't you skater boys used to it?
Bear with it. Your arm's disIocated.

22:20.405 --> 22:22.307
I've put your joint back
into position now.

22:22.307 --> 22:25.477
It'II be fine after
8 to 10 days of medication.

22:25.477 --> 22:28.347
That Iong?
You're ripping me off.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.008
I'm ripping you off?
Say that again!

22:30.382 --> 22:32.748
Ok, no probIem!

22:49.301 --> 22:53.101
-HeIIo, can I heIp you?
-I can understand Chinese.

22:53.438 --> 22:54.803
That makes it
much easier then.

22:55.273 --> 22:56.608
Sir, Iooking at you...

22:56.608 --> 23:00.203
I'm afraid your injuries
are very probIematic.

23:00.545 --> 23:03.014
It's not a matter of a few
courses of medication.

23:03.014 --> 23:04.345
-Do you understand?
-I understand.

23:05.050 --> 23:08.952
But I'm not here to see the doctor
I'm here to find some one.

23:09.621 --> 23:11.987
His name is Tai Chi-Lung.

23:12.657 --> 23:16.093
I'm sorry, but there's
no Tai Chi-Lung here.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.086
NeIson?

23:19.097 --> 23:21.190
-Sit over there.
-Okay, daddy.

23:29.307 --> 23:30.604
TweIve years ago...

23:31.476 --> 23:33.779
a group of separatist
terrorists...

23:33.779 --> 23:35.881
bombed a hoteI fuII
of American tourists...

23:35.881 --> 23:37.041
<i>in the Philippines.</i>

23:39.618 --> 23:42.644
This was in retaIiation
against the United States...

23:42.854 --> 23:46.722
<i>for assisting the Filipino government</i>
<i>in suppressing the terrorists.</i>

23:47.692 --> 23:48.852
<i>After the bombing...</i>

23:49.361 --> 23:53.231
<i>the American government authorized</i>
<i>a series of covert operations...</i>

23:53.231 --> 23:55.062
<i>to liquidate</i>
<i>those responsible.</i>

23:58.503 --> 24:01.339
<i>My job was to assassinate...</i>

24:01.339 --> 24:04.035
<i>the terrorist group's liaison</i>
<i>in Hong Kong.</i>

24:05.177 --> 24:08.237
<i>A Filipino expatriate</i>
<i>by the name of Fernandez.</i>

24:21.326 --> 24:25.023
<i>What l did not know was that the</i>
<i>British counter-intelligence...</i>

24:25.230 --> 24:27.357
in charge in Hong Kong
at the time...

24:27.632 --> 24:30.032
sent one of their
agents after me.

24:52.257 --> 24:53.892
In the pandemonium
that foIIowed...

24:53.892 --> 24:56.561
my upper vertebrae
got severed.

24:56.561 --> 24:58.430
And I was paraIyzed
from the neck down.

24:58.430 --> 25:00.830
having movement
onIy in a few fingers.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.534
After years of searching...

25:05.704 --> 25:08.502
I finaIIy found the identity
of the agent who did this.

25:08.773 --> 25:11.071
His name is - Tai Chi-Lung!

25:12.511 --> 25:14.240
When I tried
to track him down...

25:14.546 --> 25:18.676
I found out that Tai had aIready
retired from inteIIigence work...

25:18.850 --> 25:20.619
and was given
a new identity...

25:20.619 --> 25:24.077
by the Section responsibIe
for protecting former agents.

25:24.489 --> 25:27.424
And who was it who gave
him this new identity?

25:27.959 --> 25:30.086
It was you, Yue Siu-Bo!

25:36.368 --> 25:37.562
My dear sir...

25:38.436 --> 25:40.539
do you know fIipping through
the phonebook's yeIIow pages...

25:40.539 --> 25:43.440
how many peopIe caIIed Yue Siu-Bo
you'd find in Hong Kong?

25:45.076 --> 25:48.146
I'm not sure whether you
understand what I'm saying...

25:48.146 --> 25:51.309
but I'm certainIy sure I don't
understand what you are saying.

25:52.117 --> 25:54.753
I'm sorry, but with my
present medicaI skiIIs...

25:54.753 --> 25:58.314
I'm afraid I can't heIp you. I suggest
you shouId go try seeing a speciaIist.

26:00.025 --> 26:01.185
Ok.

26:02.360 --> 26:05.488
WeII, we'II meet again!

26:08.800 --> 26:09.767
NeIson?

26:10.502 --> 26:13.562
Dad, Iook, this is so cooI!

26:14.940 --> 26:16.635
Hey, are you good
at MartiaI Arts?

26:20.312 --> 26:21.301
Let's go.

27:03.254 --> 27:05.119
-Hi, Mr. Yue.
-You must be Jason.

27:05.190 --> 27:06.214
Come in, come in.

27:09.494 --> 27:10.552
Have a seat.

27:15.700 --> 27:18.567
-Sweetie, Jason's here.
-<i>OK.</i>

27:21.139 --> 27:23.475
Make yourseIf comfortabIe,
I'II go get dinner ready.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.143
-We'II be ready to eat soon.
-Great.

27:25.143 --> 27:27.077
Don't just sit there,
chat with our guest.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.377
Ok.

27:31.816 --> 27:33.215
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo.

27:33.785 --> 27:35.480
-My name's Jason.
-My name's Nicky.

27:38.023 --> 27:38.990
Dump her.

27:39.791 --> 27:40.723
What?

27:43.061 --> 27:44.551
In that case,
good Iuck to you.

27:53.371 --> 27:54.929
-You're here.
-Yeah.

27:55.440 --> 27:57.032
-It's for you.
-Thank you.

27:58.243 --> 28:01.144
-Wow, you Iook great!
-Thank you!

28:01.780 --> 28:03.548
There's something eIse.

28:03.548 --> 28:05.482
-What is it?
-Open it and take a Iook.

28:09.254 --> 28:10.414
It's so cute.

28:12.924 --> 28:15.085
-Does he have a name yet?
-No.

28:15.593 --> 28:17.151
Why don't you give
him a name?

28:21.366 --> 28:22.958
Why don't we caII him
Piggy?

28:27.138 --> 28:28.696
Piggy. That sounds great.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.166
Piggy it is then.

28:31.476 --> 28:34.639
Giving you a pig just means
he wants to pork you.

28:35.513 --> 28:37.242
Your famiIy aIso seIIs pork?

28:37.615 --> 28:39.708
Ignore him,
he's taIking rubbish.

28:41.086 --> 28:44.578
Dinner's ready!
Why is there a pig here?

28:44.989 --> 28:47.958
It's a present from Jason.
He's caIIed Piggy.

28:49.027 --> 28:51.518
Very cute,
very cute indeed.

28:51.963 --> 28:53.157
Dinner's ready!

28:54.866 --> 28:56.424
Come over, Iet's eat.

28:58.970 --> 29:01.097
So Jason, what's your
Iine of business?

29:01.606 --> 29:04.439
I'm a musician.
I'm in the music business.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.801
The music business.
That's good.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.808
-Are these dishes to your Iiking?
-They're deIicious.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.285
I'm reaIIy not picky when it
comes to intercourse.

29:14.285 --> 29:17.083
-What did you say you weren't picky about?
-No!

29:17.355 --> 29:21.326
Jason meant he wasn't picky
about dinner courses!

29:21.326 --> 29:23.658
Wasn't that what I just said?
What did I say just now?

29:25.096 --> 29:27.621
Sorry, my Chinese pronunciation
isn't aII that great.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.961
Never mind, never mind.
Eat up, eat up.

29:33.104 --> 29:37.234
Brother, can you pass me
the chicken?

29:39.644 --> 29:42.169
Can I pass you the chicken?

29:45.583 --> 29:47.676
Are we pIaying poker here?
Pass!

30:06.638 --> 30:08.799
Grandma, they're at it again.

30:44.075 --> 30:45.542
Dump her.

30:54.052 --> 30:56.316
It's a good thing you're
not picky about dinner courses.

30:56.754 --> 30:58.449
Eat up, eat up.

31:06.164 --> 31:07.153
Come in.

31:07.665 --> 31:08.654
Hi, dad.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.596
-You're reading?
-Yup.

31:13.104 --> 31:15.072
Not sIeeping yet?
Aren't you working tomorrow?

31:15.440 --> 31:17.475
Yes I am.
I'II be sIeeping soon.

31:17.475 --> 31:21.036
-Let's chat a whiIe.
-What? I'm going to sIeep.

31:21.913 --> 31:23.642
-Just for a IittIe whiIe.
-I'm going to sIeep.

31:32.991 --> 31:35.426
You've been sIacking
off your martiaI arts.

31:35.426 --> 31:38.020
When it comes to kung fu,
practice makes perfect.

31:39.297 --> 31:42.960
You know what they say:
''No pain, no gain''.

31:43.468 --> 31:45.936
-Understand?
-Yeah.

31:49.507 --> 31:50.906
Your sister's stiII young.

31:51.276 --> 31:54.609
As her eIder brother, you
shouId be more accommodating.

31:54.846 --> 31:57.815
-You hear what I'm saying?
-Yes!

32:04.856 --> 32:06.551
Your mom's been gone
for a Iong time.

32:07.158 --> 32:09.594
ShouId anything happen so
that I'm not here either...

32:09.594 --> 32:10.993
what are you going to do?

32:12.163 --> 32:15.257
You have to take care of
your sister, understand?

32:16.501 --> 32:18.059
I understand!

32:18.536 --> 32:19.662
I'm going now.

32:25.510 --> 32:27.378
Cover your shouIders
with the bIanket.

32:27.378 --> 32:29.938
If your shouIders get chiIIed,
you'II be sick a Iong time.

32:30.915 --> 32:31.973
Good night.

33:32.377 --> 33:34.479
<i>Mr. Yue,</i>
<i>l appreciate you have...</i>

33:34.479 --> 33:36.106
a job to do.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.874
But you're the onIy one who knows
the whereabouts of Tai Chi-Lung.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.186
I've come to you because
I have no other choice.

33:43.988 --> 33:45.455
It's my instinct that.

33:45.790 --> 33:48.588
If you don't teII me where
I can find this man...

33:49.260 --> 33:51.888
your Iife wiII become
increasingIy uncomfortabIe.

33:54.632 --> 33:57.465
WeII, we'II meet again.

34:09.813 --> 34:12.783
ORTHOPEDIST

35:29.660 --> 35:30.957
Have some tea.

36:16.507 --> 36:18.134
FIST OF FURY

39:19.790 --> 39:20.984
Where is Tai Chi-Lung?

39:25.396 --> 39:28.957
I aIready toId you, Iook in
the phonebook's yeIIow pages.

39:39.610 --> 39:40.542
Rocco.

39:41.278 --> 39:42.711
<i>He won't say anything.</i>

39:45.983 --> 39:47.348
Bring him back.

39:49.820 --> 39:53.381
NeIson, it's getting Iate,
why you don't go to bed?

39:53.791 --> 39:55.088
Ok, daddy.
Goodnight.

39:55.960 --> 39:56.858
Goodnight.

40:32.129 --> 40:34.393
AII you need to do is teII me
what I want to know...

40:35.266 --> 40:36.392
and you'II be out of here.

40:40.104 --> 40:43.699
Don't waste your time.
I won't teII you anything.

41:03.394 --> 41:05.589
There's no need for you
to go through with this.

41:05.963 --> 41:07.760
It's Tai who shouId
be suffering.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.068
I'm onIy doing my job.

41:22.146 --> 41:25.274
Then you'II have to make a choice between
your professionaI word of honor...

41:25.649 --> 41:26.809
or your chiIdren!

41:47.171 --> 41:48.866
TeII me where
Tai Chi-Lung is.

42:16.867 --> 42:19.131
Siu-Bo, I've got a reaIIy
bad headache...

42:49.733 --> 42:52.065
If onIy my famiIy was
as nice and cozy as yours.

43:00.477 --> 43:01.876
Nicky, you have a phone caII.

43:02.079 --> 43:04.445
Someone caIIed UncIe Chiu.
He says it's urgent.

43:21.031 --> 43:21.861
UncIe Chiu?

43:23.567 --> 43:24.829
Have you found
your father yet?

43:27.805 --> 43:29.272
He hasn't switched
on his phone.

43:32.843 --> 43:34.178
What happened?

43:34.178 --> 43:36.510
I don't know.
It was Iike this when I came.

43:56.166 --> 43:58.002
Can it be Siu-Bo's
pissed some peopIe off...

43:58.002 --> 43:59.299
so they came and
wrecked the pIace?

44:04.174 --> 44:06.335
Dad just Ioves to buIIshit.

44:06.577 --> 44:08.477
But why wouId anyone
bear a grudge?

44:15.152 --> 44:16.084
What's this?

44:16.453 --> 44:17.385
I don't know.

44:18.355 --> 44:19.379
Be carefuI.

44:37.441 --> 44:38.931
Since you're not taIking...

44:39.677 --> 44:41.907
we'II have to try
something eIse.

44:43.580 --> 44:45.172
He is my friend Edward.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.651
He's brought something
very speciaI for you.

44:50.387 --> 44:52.651
What? Vitamin C?

44:54.158 --> 44:55.284
Wrong!

44:55.926 --> 44:57.917
The answer is
Sodium PentothaI.

44:58.495 --> 45:02.090
First touted as truth serums
in the earIy 20th Century.

45:08.839 --> 45:13.970
It inhibits controI of your
centraI nervous system.

45:14.478 --> 45:17.641
And induces a 'twiIight'
hypnotic state...

45:18.182 --> 45:21.948
and eIicits a mechanicaI
recitation of truth.

45:24.288 --> 45:25.414
Now...

45:27.057 --> 45:28.615
where is Tai Chi-Iung?

45:31.895 --> 45:33.123
Where is Tai Chi-Iung?

45:35.499 --> 45:39.026
Where is Tai Chi-Iung?

45:56.286 --> 45:57.218
<i>Dad.</i>

45:58.655 --> 45:59.815
<i>Dad.</i>

46:05.896 --> 46:07.761
How do I find him?

46:10.267 --> 46:11.969
Memory card.

46:11.969 --> 46:13.163
Memory card?

46:14.004 --> 46:17.462
Inside the Iucky charms.

46:18.142 --> 46:22.203
If I find the charms,
I find Tai Chi-Iung, right?

46:24.548 --> 46:25.913
Where are the Iucky
charms kept?

46:32.523 --> 46:35.425
Underneath your mother's bed.

46:35.425 --> 46:37.723
They make sure you're
safe and sound.

46:41.431 --> 46:42.728
SEARCHING

47:06.824 --> 47:09.691
Ain't those charms around
their necks pretty?

47:24.975 --> 47:26.340
What sort of pIace is this?

47:28.178 --> 47:29.145
I don't know.

47:52.302 --> 47:55.203
<i>Let me tell you something. Daddy's</i>
<i>going to be changing jobs soon.</i>

47:55.405 --> 47:57.274
<i>After l change jobs, l won't be</i>
<i>protecting the governor anymore.</i>

47:57.274 --> 47:58.742
<i>l'll be protecting</i>
<i>special agents.</i>

47:58.742 --> 48:02.906
-What are speciaI agents?
-SpeciaI agents are...

48:04.214 --> 48:06.648
a ''speciaI'' kind of ''gents''.

48:07.084 --> 48:09.552
They sort out probIems
for other peopIe.

48:11.088 --> 48:12.656
<i>Once l'm in my</i>
<i>new job...</i>

48:12.656 --> 48:15.058
<i>l won't have so much time</i>
<i>to come with you to the beach.</i>

48:15.058 --> 48:16.355
<i>You understand that, don't you?</i>

48:17.895 --> 48:21.456
The best way to protect you is by
teaching you how to protect yourseIf.

48:22.332 --> 48:26.462
Movement must be gentIe and swift,
soft and continuous.

48:27.170 --> 48:30.071
Use your breathing
to churn up chi.

48:30.274 --> 48:32.242
Draw your spirit within...

48:32.242 --> 48:34.011
so that there is no unevenness
or discontinuity.

48:34.011 --> 48:35.501
<i>Don't you get along</i>
<i>with your dad?</i>

48:35.712 --> 48:37.577
If he wasn't so
fond of buIIshitting...

48:37.814 --> 48:39.509
I guess we'd
get aIong better.

48:40.284 --> 48:41.546
<i>Your sister's still young.</i>

48:42.286 --> 48:44.948
As her eIder brother,
you shouId be more accommodating.

48:45.489 --> 48:47.047
<i>Your mom's been gone</i>
<i>such a long time.</i>

48:47.925 --> 48:50.155
ShouId something happen,
and I'm not here either...

48:50.360 --> 48:51.759
what are you going to do?

48:53.130 --> 48:56.930
If I'm reaIIy not around, you have to
take care of your sister, understand?

48:57.167 --> 48:58.259
<i>Good night.</i>

49:02.472 --> 49:03.939
Where are you going?

49:15.018 --> 49:16.178
Princess.

49:16.453 --> 49:20.023
Princess, Iisten.
I'm handsome, and rich.

49:20.023 --> 49:23.959
And what's more, I Iove you.
Princess, marry me.

49:24.361 --> 49:27.230
Princess, I'm poor,
and not good-Iooking...

49:27.230 --> 49:30.199
but I know how to cook curry.
Marry me.

49:31.935 --> 49:34.904
You're both so fine,
I reaIIy don't know who to choose.

49:35.806 --> 49:38.741
-How much Ionger tiII it's over?
-AImost done, headmaster.

49:39.109 --> 49:42.044
For the sake of my happiness
and my future...

49:42.379 --> 49:44.006
marry me!

49:44.147 --> 49:47.250
Princess, I can cook red,
yeIIow and green curry.

49:47.250 --> 49:48.945
Do you reaIIy need to choose?

49:49.720 --> 49:51.051
Prince Muhammed.

49:51.588 --> 49:53.385
There's nothing
I detest more than curry.

49:56.393 --> 49:58.759
However, I hate handsome
guys even more.

50:00.364 --> 50:03.231
That's why I stiII choose you,
Prince Muhammed.

50:07.070 --> 50:08.367
Heavens!

50:09.239 --> 50:10.570
Guards!

50:10.974 --> 50:12.908
Seize them!

50:27.924 --> 50:29.323
That's more Iike it!

50:50.280 --> 50:52.077
EIIa, what's the matter?

50:52.282 --> 50:54.273
It's your sister!
Something's happened!

50:56.853 --> 51:00.624
Headmaster, this item
isn't in the program.

51:00.624 --> 51:03.525
PIease Ieave by the exit
to your right.

51:04.094 --> 51:06.654
What's there to be scared of?

51:08.732 --> 51:10.199
Don't hurt my princess!

51:41.898 --> 51:42.728
Let's go.

52:12.162 --> 52:12.890
What's the matter?

52:13.964 --> 52:14.931
Jason, drive!

53:13.156 --> 53:16.057
My sister Ieft these cIothes
behind. Put them on.

53:34.044 --> 53:35.272
Is there anything
I can heIp with?

53:37.914 --> 53:40.747
To be honest, I don't know
what to do myseIf.

53:41.551 --> 53:43.451
Do you know who's
after NataIie?

53:44.454 --> 53:46.615
If the stories my dad
used to teII are true...

53:47.424 --> 53:50.882
I think it has to do with a
protection service for ex-agents.

53:53.129 --> 53:54.323
So do you beIieve him?

53:57.567 --> 54:01.799
I didn't in the past,
but now I don't know.

54:57.894 --> 54:59.657
Brother, Iook.

55:00.297 --> 55:01.457
I found this inside.

55:01.998 --> 55:04.489
No wonder those peopIe tried
to grab my Iucky charm.

55:05.168 --> 55:06.157
Do you have a computer?

55:06.970 --> 55:07.868
Sure.

55:14.978 --> 55:16.036
LOADING

55:21.217 --> 55:22.582
PLEASE INSERT DISK TWO

55:24.721 --> 55:26.689
You need the other memory
card to open the fiIe.

55:49.612 --> 55:50.374
Hurry!

56:17.574 --> 56:18.905
Sister, be carefuI!

58:11.154 --> 58:12.178
Bitch!

59:54.991 --> 59:55.855
Brother.

59:56.326 --> 59:57.554
Are you aII right?

59:58.027 --> 59:58.857
Let's go.

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:14.209
You got it?

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:15.668
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:21.850
If I am correct,
you must be Nicky.

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:23.245
Did you capture my father?

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:25.580
Seems Iike you are
a good fighter...

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:27.817
<i>just like your father.</i>

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:28.921
What is it that you want?

01:00:29.158 --> 01:00:30.625
You bastard!
Let my daddy go.

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:35.624
Listen good.

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:37.934
If you and your
sister don't hand...

01:00:37.934 --> 01:00:40.494
over the memory cards,
your father wiII be died.

01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:42.564
You wouIdn't dare.
I'II burn them.

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:46.509
SIight change of pIan.

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:49.045
The memory cards you have
contain detaiIed information...

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:51.070
<i>of a retired spy</i>
<i>l am looking for.</i>

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:52.712
<i>His name is Tai Chi-Lung.</i>

You bring him to me...

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:57.286
and your father's
Iife wiII be spared.

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:58.588
Ok, I'II do it.

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.249
But first you have Iet me

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:23.907
Dad!

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:26.104
Quick, take your sister

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:30.450
Excuse me, he is not

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:35.985
You have one day
to bring Tai Chi-Lung to me.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:39.526
Try anything funny and

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:44.630
Keep the phone now.
I wiII be in contact with you.

01:01:44.967 --> 01:01:47.561
-HeIIo? HeIIo?
-WeII, how is dad?

01:01:49.005 --> 01:01:51.565
We onIy have one day. We have

USER VOICE
RECOGNITION REQUIRED

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:14.795
There's encryption

01:02:14.997 --> 01:02:16.165
What does that mean?

01:02:16.165 --> 01:02:17.757
It means we need
Mr. Yue's voiceprint.

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:20.527
To open this fiIe,
we need Mr. Yue's voice.

01:02:28.444 --> 01:02:31.114
I've got dad's voice

<i>Answer the phone.</i>
<i>Answer the phone.</i>

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:34.749

01:02:40.223 --> 01:02:42.020
How Iong wiII it take?
We don't have much time!

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:44.456
It'd take a few hours.
I'II do my best.

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:47.453
Thanks.

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:34.900
Hey buddy.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.273
How about a bottIe of beer?

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:54.260
You don't do it Iike this.

01:03:58.534 --> 01:03:59.626
Are you sure you
know how to do it?

01:03:59.936 --> 01:04:02.427
I Iearned first aid in schooI.
Of course I know how.

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:07.467
Thanks.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:09.478
For what?

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.444
For saving me just now.

01:04:13.649 --> 01:04:16.482
If you hadn't, I wouIdn't
have known you cared about me.

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:31.191
My bandaging skiIIs aren't
as good...

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:33.794
as dad's.

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:38.737
Dad said he wanted to come
see my pIay today.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.032
I wouIdn't Iet him.

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:46.605
We've both misunderstood him.

01:04:50.753 --> 01:04:52.721
He's been teIIing
the truth aII aIong.

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.061
TRANSFER IN PROGRESS

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:30.612
Sorry, Mister.

Yes. I've just opened it.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:32.474
Brother, the fiIe's open!

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:04.060
You know him?

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:05.867
UncIe Chiu's one
of dad's friends.

01:09:05.941 --> 01:09:08.102
He comes aII the time to have his
injuries treated. He was a speciaI agent?

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:10.108
There's no time,
we've got to find him now.

01:09:10.345 --> 01:09:11.176
I'II take you.

01:09:13.215 --> 01:09:14.546
We need that memory card.

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:21.482
-What are you doing?
-Jason, open the door!

01:09:25.728 --> 01:09:28.196
Sorry, I can't Iet you go

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:31.095
I'm actuaIIy just

01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:32.894
I'm aIso in the protective
service for retired agents.

01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:36.336
<i>The organization thought that</i>
<i>as Mr. Yue's getting old.</i>

01:09:36.438 --> 01:09:38.406
<i>He might not be able to</i>
<i>handle things on his own...</i>

01:09:38.506 --> 01:09:40.337
<i>so they sent me to be</i>
<i>his secret backup.</i>

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:43.777
<i>Your father knew the risks</i>

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:46.611
<i>l want you to understand,</i>

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:48.206
<i>to be ready</i>
<i>to sacrifice ourselves.</i>

01:09:48.716 --> 01:09:50.377
Now that UncIe Chiu's
in danger...

01:09:50.653 --> 01:09:52.746
it's my responsibiIity
to protect him.

01:09:58.694 --> 01:09:59.626
NataIie.

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:01.587
I'm sorry.

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:03.089
But you have to beIieve me.

01:10:03.566 --> 01:10:04.828
<i>My feelings for you are real.</i>

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:07.969
Bastard! You're with me onIy
because of your job!

01:10:09.905 --> 01:10:12.465
-Wait!
-Open the door!

01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:23.410
I've got something
to show you.

01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:28.451
See?
There's nothing in this hand.

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:29.823
Look here.

01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:34.255
It's for you.

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:19.305
Young sister.

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:24.871
Siu-Mun.

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:28.575
Look at you, so careIess!

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:30.443
Why did you put so
much butter on it?

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:31.714
It tastes good.

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.684
Nowadays we have to be
heaIthy in our diet.

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:36.985
So much butter means
a Iot of choIesteroI.

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:39.256
Grandpa, you're just a miser.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.334
-What wouId you Iike to have, sir?
-Where's your boss?

01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:22.996
Just a minute. Boss, there's
someone to see you.

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:25.534
-There's someone to see you.
-Ok.

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:30.001
How do you do?
You're Iooking for me?

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:31.068
Tai Chi-Lung.

01:12:31.413 --> 01:12:33.347
Don't worry,
I'm here to protect you.

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:37.481
Your cover's been bIown.
You need to Ieave immediateIy.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.544
Siu-Bo?

01:12:42.591 --> 01:12:44.855
How much time do I have?

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.789
None.
We have to Ieave now!

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:55.463
-Just a minute.
-UncIe Chiu?

01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:56.796
Right away.

01:13:37.112 --> 01:13:38.602
Young Iady,
where's UncIe Chiu?

01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:41.515
You won't catch him.

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:33.458
What the fuck!

01:14:47.983 --> 01:14:49.211
Don't run, UncIe Chiu.

01:14:50.018 --> 01:14:51.280
There are peopIe out
there Iooking for you.

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:53.680
If you run,
I can't guarantee your safety.

01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:55.213
Save your breath.

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:57.852
Except for Siu-Bo,
I won't trust anyone.

01:14:58.193 --> 01:15:00.286
Yue Siu-Bo's aIready
been captured.

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:02.092
The peopIe who took him
are after you.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.822
Whether you beIieve me or not,
my duty is to take you away from here.

01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:06.961
I'm oId.

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:08.797
I don't want to go anywhere.

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:11.064
Then forgive me.

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:19.373
-UncIe Chiu.
-UncIe Chiu.

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:20.506
-UncIe Chiu.
-UncIe Chiu.

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:22.542
Has anyone seen UncIe Chiu?

01:15:23.252 --> 01:15:24.184
I haven't.

01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:26.512
He went that way.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.732
Chiu's FoodstaII and my
grand-daughter are my Iife.

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:51.437
Even if you're truIy who you say
You are, I'm not going with you.

01:17:10.892 --> 01:17:11.722
UncIe Chiu.

01:17:12.594 --> 01:17:14.425
UncIe Chiu,
someone's captured dad.

01:17:14.496 --> 01:17:17.465
You're the onIy one who can save
Him now. PIease come with us.

01:17:18.166 --> 01:17:19.360
I'm not going with you.

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:22.597
You want to save Siu-Bo.
I admire that.

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:26.233
But Chiu's FoodstaII
And Siu-Mun are my Iife.

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:29.106
I want to see my
grand-daughter grow up.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:32.045
How can I bear to be
parted from them?

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:34.773
I don't want to die yet.
Sorry.

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:39.478
UncIe Chiu, I can't just stand
by whiIe my dad's in danger.

01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:41.655
Get up first.

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:45.757
The man who took dad
Isn't even after him.

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:47.461
He's after you, UncIe Chiu.

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:51.429
Even if you can get away this time,
they'II stiII keep on coming after you...

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:55.666
and then they'II take your grand-daughter
hostage to force you to show yourseIf.

01:17:56.538 --> 01:17:58.199
Instead of running away Iike this...

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.136
and having to constantIy worry
about your famiIy...

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:03.406
why don't you try
standing up to them...

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:05.105
and soIve this matter
once and for aII?

01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:40.137
Whether it's to heIp my
Dad or to heIp yourseIf...

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:41.940
I'm begging you, pIease!

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:43.877
I'm begging you, UncIe Chiu!

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:05.501
I remember years ago,
I aImost died on a mission.

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.308
It was Siu-Bo who
saved my Iife.

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:12.071
He aIIowed me to Iive a happy
Iife these dozen-odd years.

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:14.906
I opened Chiu's FoodstaII.

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:17.214
I had my grand-daughter
Siu-Mun.

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.712
I watched her grow up,
Day by day.

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:24.187
I feeI I've been very Iucky.

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:30.223
Very weII. I'II go with you.
Get up.

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:32.399
-Thank you, uncIe Chiu!
-Thank you, uncIe Chiu!

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:34.469
Nicky?

01:19:42.677 --> 01:19:45.168
We take different stands.
There's nothing to taIk about.

01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:56.884
Don't worry.

01:19:57.058 --> 01:19:59.185
I'II give my Iife to
bring UncIe Chiu back.

01:20:19.848 --> 01:20:23.113
-<i>Are you with him?</i>
-<i>l have Tai Chi-Lung.</i>

01:20:24.286 --> 01:20:25.913
Bring him to
The Sai Kung pier.

01:20:26.521 --> 01:20:28.148
Somebody wiII be there
to meet you.

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:30.621
<i>l want to speak</i>
<i>to my father first.</i>

01:20:31.426 --> 01:20:32.484
<i>Be patient...</i>

01:20:33.128 --> 01:20:34.459
<i>you will see him shortly.</i>

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:36.659
<i>Let me remind you...</i>

01:20:36.898 --> 01:20:39.662
<i>if l sense anything remotely</i>
<i>inappropriate...</i>

01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:42.495
for exampIe, the cops...

01:20:44.239 --> 01:20:47.299
he wiII be the best IittIe snack
your doIphins have ever tasted.

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:35.816
You must be Nicky.

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:38.191
NataIie.

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:40.485
It's nice to finaIIy meet you.

01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:42.020
Where's my father?

01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:44.455
Where's Tai-Chi-Lung?

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:47.497
He won't appear untiI
We see our father.

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:22.731
Don't be stupid.

01:22:23.505 --> 01:22:24.665
You're wasting time.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:35.007
Your father is struggIing to
get oxygen into his Iungs.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.381
He has eight minutes Ieft.

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:45.487
I ask you one more time.

01:22:46.394 --> 01:22:47.793
Where's Tai Chi-Lung?

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:49.052
I'm here.

01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:04.074
Tai Chi-Lung,
Do you remember me?

01:23:05.213 --> 01:23:06.407
I may be oId...

01:23:07.449 --> 01:23:08.882
but my memory's
stiII very good.

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:11.644
Your target is me.

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:13.644
Let them go.

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:16.723
You don't come into my den
and teII me what to do.

01:23:18.593 --> 01:23:19.719
For tweIve years...

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:22.495
I sat paraIyzed
In the jaiI ceII.

01:23:22.897 --> 01:23:26.534
I Iost my wife and the most
precious time with my son...

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:27.558
because of you!

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:30.137
How dare you give me orders?

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:33.136
I'II take responsibiIity
for my own actions.

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:35.141
Nicky.

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.616
Take your father
and sister away from here.

01:23:41.616 --> 01:23:43.846
UncIe Chiu, I swore
I wouIdn't Ieave you behind.

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:47.316
Listen to me, there's no
need to sacrifice yourseIves.

01:23:47.489 --> 01:23:48.786
FrankIy speaking...

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:50.818
none of you are
going anywhere.

01:24:19.254 --> 01:24:20.983
You go save Dad,
I'II take care of Rocco.

01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:27.052
KiII them aII!

01:25:35.897 --> 01:25:37.159
Get that oId man!

01:25:50.445 --> 01:25:51.309
Stop!

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.238
Don't kiII him!

01:25:55.216 --> 01:25:57.878
I want him to suffer
Iike I suffered.

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:16.159
-UncIe Chiu?
-I'm aII right.

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:20.097
You go ahead and hide.

01:27:06.988 --> 01:27:09.548
It's useIess, even steeI
won't crack this gIass!

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:00.857
Dad!

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:22.215
Don't faII asIeep! Get up!

01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:26.988
Quick, get up!

01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:29.354
Don't sIeep!

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:35.351
Don't faII asIeep!
Don't sIeep!

01:30:37.465 --> 01:30:38.454
Dad!

01:30:39.233 --> 01:30:40.666
Don't sIeep!

01:31:25.079 --> 01:31:27.482
<i>Movement must be gentle</i>
<i>and swift, soft and continuous.</i>

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:29.150
<i>Use your breathing</i>
<i>to churn up chi.</i>

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:32.051
<i>Draw your spirit within...</i>

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:36.254
so that there is no unevenness or
discontinuity.

01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:39.260
To ascend, discard aII notions
of descending...

01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:41.228
sever it at its very root.

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:42.663
Do you understand?

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:45.230
No, I don't understand.

01:31:45.633 --> 01:31:46.657
You don't understand?

01:31:48.002 --> 01:31:51.205
It means make a Phoenix Fist
and hit with aII your might.

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:53.673
<i>Hit the spot in the</i>
<i>middle until it breaks.</i>

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:48.220
-You hit me? You dare to hit me?
-PIease Iet me go!

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:22.259
-KiII me!

01:33:23.965 --> 01:33:25.796
Don't you touch my daddy!

01:33:27.301 --> 01:33:28.290
Come on!

01:33:42.883 --> 01:33:45.215
-Siu-Bo.
-Dad!

01:33:45.519 --> 01:33:47.555
How are you? Take another
breathe before you speak.

01:33:47.555 --> 01:33:49.290
-You rotten kid!
-InhaIe some oxygen!

01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:51.092
You want me to inhaIe
from this fire extinguisher.

01:33:51.092 --> 01:33:52.526
InhaIe some oxygen.

01:33:52.526 --> 01:33:54.528
Do I Iook Iike
I need oxygen?

01:33:54.528 --> 01:33:57.131
You Iook Iike you need
oxygen more than I do.

01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:59.500
-Yeah. You want me to make a caII?
-Don't be angry, dad.

01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.202
-CaII you an ambuIance?
-Yeah, yeah.

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:02.670
You reaIIy care so much
about dad?

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:04.071
Then give dad a few hundred
bucks for to spend.

01:34:04.071 --> 01:34:05.706
Yeah Iet's go.

01:34:05.706 --> 01:34:07.341
You didn't come when your
father needed you...

01:34:07.341 --> 01:34:08.943
and now that I'm fine,
you turn up.

01:34:08.943 --> 01:34:10.277
Didn't you see how cooI
I was just now?

01:34:10.277 --> 01:34:11.879
It was one of me against more than
a hundred! I beat them up reaI good!

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:13.381
Punch to the Ieft,
kick to the right.

01:34:13.381 --> 01:34:14.815
Punch to the right,
kick to the Ieft.

01:34:14.815 --> 01:34:16.684
-Yeah right, take another breath.
-Let me rest for a whiIe.

01:34:16.684 --> 01:34:19.220
We'II rest when we get back.
Let's get back first.

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:20.710
No, I'm panting.

01:34:22.590 --> 01:34:25.926
There's no need to taIk about
parenting anymore, dear.

01:34:25.926 --> 01:34:28.796
Both our kids have
turned out fine.

01:34:28.796 --> 01:34:30.831
Just Iast week,
on Father's Day...

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:32.700
they took me out for tea.

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:35.269
Our son even wrote me
an $88.8 check...

01:34:35.269 --> 01:34:38.500
and toId me to hurry up
and find myseIf a mate.

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:40.906
I understand.

01:34:41.342 --> 01:34:44.945
Our kids are aII grown up.
They have their worId.

01:34:44.945 --> 01:34:47.937
There's no more time
for oId dad, right?

01:34:49.183 --> 01:34:51.674
Mei-Li, I miss
you very much.

01:35:02.963 --> 01:35:04.191
-Mr. Yue?
-Come in.

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:08.761
My daughter's
stiII mad at you...

01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:11.172
but she's not one
to stay mad for Iong.

01:35:11.172 --> 01:35:13.240
Just say nice things
and work on her a bit...

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:14.742
-she'II come round in no time.
-Ok.

01:35:14.742 --> 01:35:16.300
She's a reaI softie at heart.

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:18.444
Say nice things,
Don't shoot your mouth off.

01:35:19.246 --> 01:35:21.305
-You go sort her out yourseIf.
-Ok. Thanks, Mr. Yue.

01:35:30.791 --> 01:35:31.815
Come in.

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:37.531
Why are you here?
We've aIready spIit up.

01:35:40.835 --> 01:35:42.268
Can you give me
One more chance?

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:43.559
No.

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:55.709
The days we spent together...

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:59.181
were the happiest
days of my Iife.

01:36:02.923 --> 01:36:04.788
I know no matter
How I expIain...

01:36:05.059 --> 01:36:06.287
You're not going to forgive me.

01:36:07.595 --> 01:36:09.586
So, I respect your decision.

01:36:11.699 --> 01:36:13.428
Even though we're
no Ionger together...

01:36:14.702 --> 01:36:16.135
I stiII wish you aII the best.

01:36:17.004 --> 01:36:18.733
I hope you find someone...

01:36:20.574 --> 01:36:22.599
who Ioves you even
more than I do.

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:23.505
What?

01:36:23.878 --> 01:36:26.369
You're giving up so easiIy?
I'm a girI!

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.313
How can you be so
Iacking in sincerity?

01:36:30.684 --> 01:36:31.946
What's that supposed to mean?

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:34.411
Does it mean we can
carry on dating?

01:36:34.989 --> 01:36:36.149
What do you think?

01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:38.124
We can, right?

01:36:39.994 --> 01:36:40.858
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:36:41.495 --> 01:36:43.258
<i>l was so worried you</i>
<i>didn't want me anymore.</i>

01:36:43.931 --> 01:36:46.092
-<i>Serves you right!</i>
-Let's go. Let's go.

01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:54.841
They've made up.

01:37:02.016 --> 01:37:03.950
-Are you bored?
-Yeah.

01:37:04.985 --> 01:37:07.078
-Want to French kiss?
-Yeah!

01:37:08.122 --> 01:37:09.054
CIose the door first.

01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:17.327
-<i>Time's up.</i>
-<i>What?</i>

01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:24.896
Your chess game's
reaIIy improved a Iot.

01:37:25.673 --> 01:37:26.935
You want a massacre?

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:29.637
SIaughter aII my pieces?

01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:31.541
Can't you Iet me take
just one measIy pawn?

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:34.006
If you're in the same boat,
it makes you famiIy.

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:38.682
Even pawns are
human beings too.

01:37:39.453 --> 01:37:42.149
They aIso need to
be protected.

01:37:42.256 --> 01:37:47.717
TruIy, wiII you continue
protecting us fraiI oId agents?

01:37:48.996 --> 01:37:50.520
Dream on!

01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:55.294
Never again. I'm going to
enjoy famiIy Iife.

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:57.370
FamiIy's very important.

01:37:57.438 --> 01:37:58.268
Check!

01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:01.440
Check? I'II just move

01:38:01.508 --> 01:38:03.203
You move aside,
I check again!
