01:24.384 --> 01:29.344
Goal!

01:34.227 --> 01:35.888
Our next film
is "Medellin,"

01:35.929 --> 01:39.126
the ultraviolent story
of Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar

01:39.165 --> 01:41.895
staring Vincent Chase
in a fat suit and bad makeup

01:41.935 --> 01:44.563
that makes him look like
the lovechild of Jiminy Glick

01:44.604 --> 01:45.935
and a case of Twinkies.

01:45.972 --> 01:47.837
Now at last year's
Cannes Film Festival

01:47.874 --> 01:50.365
"Medellin" from wunderkind
director Billy Walsh

01:50.410 --> 01:53.072
was all the buzz
until people actually saw it

01:53.113 --> 01:55.581
at the now legendary
Hindenburg of a screening

01:55.615 --> 01:57.139
which I myself attended.

01:57.183 --> 01:59.447
Now I usually try to keep
my opinions to myself

01:59.486 --> 02:01.317
until we actually review
a film on this show,

02:01.354 --> 02:04.653
but this time I got on my feet and I booed
with the rest of the angry mob.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.989
I would have thrown fruit
if I'd had some.

02:07.026 --> 02:09.119
Richard, this is the silliest thing
to come out of South America

02:09.162 --> 02:11.460
since the musical "Evita."
It's overacted,

02:11.498 --> 02:14.467
it's underdirected,
it's paced like a snail.

02:14.501 --> 02:17.026
- Did I mention it's long too?
- You did. It is.

02:17.070 --> 02:19.971
The year is young,
but this is a good bet

02:20.006 --> 02:22.201
for my top 10
of the year's worst.

02:22.242 --> 02:23.971
Oh, and by the way, Vince,
Al Pacino called.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.035
He wants his
"Scarface" accent back.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.070
You know, it's a real disappointment
for me because I had Vinnie Chase

02:28.114 --> 02:31.447
on my list of stars
to watch in 2005.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.419
I think I'm gonna have him on my list
of stars to watch fade in 2008.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.115
Suck it, dickbag.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.623
"Medellin" with a budget
I cannot imagine,

02:37.657 --> 02:40.091
is a straight to DVD release,
if you can believe it.

02:40.126 --> 02:42.117
It can be found at...

02:42.162 --> 02:44.323
Sorry, E.

02:44.364 --> 02:46.992
It's okay.
Not like I wasn't expecting it.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.228
Yeah, still, once you hear it
coming out of their mouths

02:49.269 --> 02:51.430
on TV about you personally,
it stinks.

02:51.471 --> 02:54.338
I remember crying
myself to sleep

02:54.374 --> 02:57.207
when Roger Ebert singled out
my performance in "License to Drive"

02:57.243 --> 02:59.143
as the end of the Golden Age
of Cinema.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.545
Oh, baby, fuck critics.
What do they know?

03:01.581 --> 03:03.776
Nothing, baby.
Nothing.

03:03.816 --> 03:05.875
Will you mind telling me
when someone else is in the room?

03:05.919 --> 03:07.819
- Sorry, E.
- That's okay, Jacqueline.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.788
I just like to know you're there.
How's France?

03:09.822 --> 03:10.846
It's lovely.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.051
When are we gonna see you
again three dimensionally?

03:13.092 --> 03:14.923
- Soon, I hope.
- Not soon enough.

03:14.961 --> 03:18.556
- Oh, baby.
- I miss you, baby.

03:18.598 --> 03:20.190
I miss you too, baby.

03:20.233 --> 03:22.030
All right, I'm gonna talk
to E for a second.

03:22.068 --> 03:24.127
I'll check back in
after I wash up.

03:24.170 --> 03:26.604
Okay, baby.
I love you.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.539
I love you.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.907
- Chirp.
- Tweet.

03:32.512 --> 03:35.072
What? Like you never
had a long-distance relationship?

03:35.114 --> 03:36.581
Not one with bird noises.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.413
Whatever.

03:38.451 --> 03:41.352
I'm gonna get some sleep.
I need my beauty rest.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.514
I'm shooting the "Five Towns"
poster tomorrow.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.252
Unless you want to pound
some whiskey and talk.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.760
Nah, I'm fine.
I just hope Vince is okay though.

03:48.795 --> 03:51.787
Yeah, poor baby bro.

04:25.398 --> 04:28.265
Are we ever gonna get
to use the bed?

04:28.301 --> 04:30.769
Come on, honey.
There's nothing wrong with the hammock.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.548
- Hey, Ari. Fuck Richard Roeper.
- Uh-huh.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.985
- Michael Phillips is a dick.
- Yup.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.251
- I liked Gene Siskel.
- Whatever.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.349
Give me something
good, Lloyd.

04:52.392 --> 04:55.555
First draft of my letter
to one Richard E. Roeper

04:55.595 --> 04:58.120
reviewing him personally...
his clothes, his hair,

04:58.164 --> 04:59.529
his nasally
midwestern twang.

04:59.565 --> 05:02.398
- Screw Chicago and...
- Attention everyone, please!

05:02.435 --> 05:04.369
Listen up.

05:04.404 --> 05:07.464
No one mention
Richard Roeper again.

05:07.507 --> 05:08.974
Not today, not ever.

05:09.008 --> 05:11.841
By doing so,
you are simply announcing

05:11.878 --> 05:14.108
that on Sunday nights
instead of doing your job

05:14.147 --> 05:17.275
reading scripts,
you're watching TV.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.718
The next person
to mention Richard Roeper

05:20.753 --> 05:22.186
will be fired.

05:22.221 --> 05:24.382
And, Lloyd,
you will also be fired

05:24.424 --> 05:26.756
if you don't answer
the fucking phone!

05:26.793 --> 05:29.023
Ari Gold's office.

05:29.062 --> 05:32.463
- I liked "Medellin," Ari.
- Then you're a fucking idiot.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.125
Carl Ertz on one.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.328
Everybody get to work!

05:36.369 --> 05:38.269
Carl, my man.
How you doing?

05:38.304 --> 05:41.102
I saw your trailer last night.
Very very scary stuff.

05:41.140 --> 05:43.506
Makes "Nightmare on Elm Street"
look like "Free Willy."

05:43.543 --> 05:45.443
I saw Roeper last night.

05:45.478 --> 05:49.471
Fuck Richard Roeper.
You know, I went to college with him.

05:49.515 --> 05:52.245
Yeah, when we was pledging
we used to tie beer cans around his nuts

05:52.285 --> 05:54.014
and make him walk
across campus.

05:54.053 --> 05:55.816
I think last night
was payback.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.221
- I've been thinking about Vince.
- Oh yeah?

05:58.257 --> 06:00.782
- Yeah, for "Danger Beach."
- I thought you had Emile Hirsch for that.

06:00.827 --> 06:03.227
No, we don't.
Have you read it?

06:03.262 --> 06:05.560
- Despite the title.
- It's a working title.

06:05.598 --> 06:08.624
Listen, I read it.
It's good. It's good.

06:08.668 --> 06:11.159
- I want to sit down with Vince.
- He's in Mexico.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.968
Yeah, I heard he's hiding out
on the beach somewhere, huh?

06:14.006 --> 06:15.564
Think again.
He's doing improvised readings

06:15.608 --> 06:17.735
with Cuaron and Del Toro
till something pops.

06:17.777 --> 06:21.577
I'm not messing around, Ari.
I want Vince for this movie.

06:21.614 --> 06:24.310
Carl, if you think you can
get Vinnie Chase,

06:24.350 --> 06:26.545
the star of the highest
grossing movie of all time,

06:26.586 --> 06:29.521
at a cut rate just 'cause
you think he's in a rut...

06:29.555 --> 06:32.046
Ari, I love Vince.
I've always loved Vince.

06:32.091 --> 06:33.683
How many things did he
turn me down on?

06:33.726 --> 06:35.591
- One or two.
- Six, but who's counting?

06:35.628 --> 06:37.994
I'll pay his full freight.

06:38.030 --> 06:40.999
- Is this an offer, Carl?
- As soon as I sit down with him.

06:41.033 --> 06:42.967
Although, listen,
I gotta go to Greece on Wednesday,

06:43.002 --> 06:45.562
which means I need to
see him tomorrow

06:45.605 --> 06:47.539
at The Grill for lunch.
See if you can make it happen.

06:47.573 --> 06:50.167
I'll do what I can.
Lloyd!

06:50.209 --> 06:53.542
Get E on the phone
right fucking now.

06:54.881 --> 06:57.145
The Murphy Group.
Can I help you?

06:57.183 --> 07:00.414
Uh-huh, just one second,
please.

07:01.988 --> 07:04.422
Look, just don't tell him
the script sucked like you did last time.

07:04.457 --> 07:05.924
Yeah, but it's not funny.

07:05.958 --> 07:08.119
'Cause it's "Cold Case."
It's not supposed to be funny.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.629
- Leave the comedy for the stand-up.
- All right.

07:10.663 --> 07:13.461
A Mr. Ari Gold's
on the phone.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.490
- Tell him I'll call him back.
- Okay.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.127
You trust me?

07:17.170 --> 07:18.933
Soon as I get a job,
then I'll start trusting you.

07:18.971 --> 07:21.098
Look, you've been with me three months,
you've had four screen tests.

07:21.140 --> 07:22.539
You're gonna get
a job soon, I promise.

07:22.575 --> 07:25.305
You got to tell my mom this.
She's the one killing me.

07:26.813 --> 07:29.281
Mr. Gold says
it's urgent.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.442
Will you put him
through, please?

07:31.484 --> 07:33.111
Sorry, Charlie.

07:33.152 --> 07:35.143
Well well well,
long time no hear.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.656
What, you got Bea Arthur
answering the phones for you?

07:37.690 --> 07:39.317
I'm in a meeting, Ari.
What do you want?

07:39.358 --> 07:40.848
Ah, yes. The Murphy Group
doubling in size

07:40.893 --> 07:42.656
the past five months
to two clients.

07:42.695 --> 07:45.163
- I have three clients, Ari.
- You do?

07:45.198 --> 07:47.257
I mean, I thought
I was your only client.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.961
Besides the guy
on the wall.

07:49.001 --> 07:51.094
- You're the only one that matters, Charlie.
- Okay.

07:51.137 --> 07:54.538
- What do you want, Ari?
- To bring our boy back from the abyss.

07:54.574 --> 07:56.235
Oh yeah?
How are you planning on doing that?

07:56.275 --> 07:57.833
Already in motion.
We got an offer.

07:57.877 --> 08:00.107
- You got an offer? For what?
- "Danger Beach."

08:00.146 --> 08:01.704
I thought Emile Hirsch
was doing "Danger Beach."

08:01.747 --> 08:03.009
No, Vincent Chase is doing it.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.017
And wow, you really are in the business.
You read it?

08:05.051 --> 08:07.076
Oh yeah, I read it.
I liked it, except for the dumb title.

08:07.119 --> 08:09.019
It's a working title.

08:09.055 --> 08:11.421
- Are they gonna pay him?
- Wow, all about the money these days.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.823
Makes me proud
and yet a little sad

08:13.860 --> 08:17.023
that you've lost that
prepubescent boyish charm.

08:17.063 --> 08:19.190
Yeah, they're gonna offer him
his full quote.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.393
Come on.
That's unbelievable.

08:21.434 --> 08:24.733
Well, start believing and start breaking
out your best travel agenting skills

08:24.770 --> 08:27.136
because we need him here
by lunchtime tomorrow

08:27.173 --> 08:28.504
to have a meeting
with Carl Ertz.

08:28.541 --> 08:29.769
What kind of meeting?

08:29.809 --> 08:32.208
Carl wants to see
if his eyes

08:32.245 --> 08:33.542
are still as blue as ever.

08:33.578 --> 08:34.876
So do we have an offer
or a meeting?

08:34.914 --> 08:37.178
We have an offer
pending a meeting.

08:37.216 --> 08:40.116
An offer pending a meeting
is not a fucking offer, Ari.

08:40.152 --> 08:42.052
How long have you been
in this town, Opie?

08:42.087 --> 08:44.181
An offer pending a meeting

08:44.222 --> 08:47.989
is what you get when you
make a shit movie

08:48.027 --> 08:51.190
and haven't been seen this side
of the border in six months.

08:51.230 --> 08:53.357
We're living in
a post "Medellin" world.

08:53.399 --> 08:55.560
But amazingly enough,
if Vince shows up

08:55.601 --> 08:57.091
with all of his limbs
intact

08:57.136 --> 08:59.570
and doesn't have some sort
of seizure in front of Ertz,

08:59.605 --> 09:03.041
we are back in the game.
Okay, you'll call?

09:03.075 --> 09:04.667
Hey, I've got to
roll, man.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.507
Yeah, Ari.
I'll call, I'll call.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.446
Good luck, Charlie.

09:08.481 --> 09:11.041
What luck? You got to take me.
I don't have a car.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.847
You've been in LA
six months and you don't have a car?

09:13.886 --> 09:15.444
Hey, man, I can't afford
a car, all right?

09:15.488 --> 09:17.547
Look, get me a job,
then I can get a car.

09:17.590 --> 09:18.989
Let's go.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.267
Hey, we gonna outdo
last year's poster, Johnny?

09:29.302 --> 09:31.930
You know it, son.
You know it.

09:31.971 --> 09:33.939
So I told the mofo

09:33.973 --> 09:36.066
nobody upstages
Johnny Chase.

09:37.977 --> 09:40.172
Okay, perfect, perfect.
That's perfect.

09:40.212 --> 09:43.010
Johnny, switch partners
with Ron and take Linda now.

09:43.049 --> 09:45.415
No problem.

09:46.852 --> 09:48.877
Beautiful, I love it.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.411
Okay, spin her again.
Spin her again.

09:50.456 --> 09:52.549
As you wish.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.158
Could "Dancing with
the Stars" be next for us?

09:57.196 --> 09:59.164
Beautiful, beautiful.

09:59.198 --> 10:00.927
Okay, now some more
serious stuff.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.798
Everyone just give me
a left side pose.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.201
Beautiful.
Lovely. Lovely.

10:07.239 --> 10:08.672
Okay, everyone give me
a right side pose.

10:10.509 --> 10:12.977
Hey, Johnny, you want to
turn to the right?

10:13.012 --> 10:15.640
- Uh, no, not really.
- Oh God, here we go.

10:15.681 --> 10:18.309
- Why not?
- 'Cause actually, I don't go right.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.615
What do you mean,
you don't go right?

10:20.653 --> 10:22.814
I mean I don't go right.
It's my bad side.

10:22.855 --> 10:24.618
- Everyone knows that.
- I didn't know that.

10:24.657 --> 10:25.919
Have you ever
seen the show, pal?

10:25.958 --> 10:27.482
Uh, no. But I'm in
Europe a lot.

10:27.526 --> 10:30.518
Well, we've done 54 episodes
and I've never gone right.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.827
Even if we do 500 more
I never will.

10:32.865 --> 10:34.662
Come on, Johnny.
Let's just get this done.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.759
Let him shoot you without
a padded bra, Linda,

10:36.802 --> 10:38.736
then I'll let him
shoot my right side.

10:38.771 --> 10:40.898
- I really don't see the issue.
- No?

10:40.940 --> 10:43.408
You don't see this
right here?

10:43.442 --> 10:45.501
Maybe we should
call the producers.

10:47.246 --> 10:48.372
Maybe we should.

10:48.414 --> 10:50.678
Okay, people,
let's take a break.

10:52.618 --> 10:54.176
Go ahead,
call the producers.

10:54.220 --> 10:55.585
What, is this guy
threatening me?

10:55.621 --> 10:58.317
They know. Eddie Burns knows.
Everyone knows.

10:58.357 --> 11:00.484
Shooting me from the right
makes me look...

11:00.526 --> 11:02.619
freakish.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.126
Whoo-hoo!

11:08.734 --> 11:10.668
Come on!

11:10.703 --> 11:13.467
- Whoo!
- Hoo!

11:33.159 --> 11:35.059
- The life, huh?
- Oh yeah.

11:35.094 --> 11:36.789
- Anyone hungry?
- Getting there.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.922
Could we make it to
the beach-side fiesta?

11:38.964 --> 11:41.023
When you put it like that,
who could say no?

11:45.304 --> 11:47.272
Yo, Vin.
Vin, Vin.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.864
It's the real world
calling.

11:48.908 --> 11:50.569
- Ma?
- E.

11:50.609 --> 11:52.577
- Really?
- Should I answer it?

11:52.611 --> 11:53.771
Yeah.

11:56.248 --> 11:58.045
Yo, E, what's up?

11:58.084 --> 12:00.814
How's your office?
Any of your wannabes touching my shit?

12:00.853 --> 12:02.844
Your office has remained
untouched, Turtle.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.219
And I'm sure it will
continue to be.

12:04.256 --> 12:05.484
Now let me talk to Vince.

12:05.524 --> 12:07.082
Not if you're gonna rain
on our parade of pussy.

12:07.126 --> 12:09.117
Put him on the phone,
Turtle.

12:09.161 --> 12:11.356
Vin, talk to E.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.059
Yo, E.
How goes it?

12:14.100 --> 12:16.193
Great. We got
a project for you.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.759
Wow, no hello?
No how are you?

12:17.803 --> 12:19.600
Sorry about that, buddy.
How are you?

12:19.638 --> 12:21.435
- How do I sound?
- You sound good.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.135
- I am.
- Good.

12:23.175 --> 12:24.938
- How are you?
- I'm good.

12:24.977 --> 12:27.138
Good.

12:27.179 --> 12:29.943
- So what you got?
- A cool genre movie.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.177
The producer really wants you.
Could you come back and meet him?

12:32.218 --> 12:34.345
Yeah, sure. Send the script,
we'll set up a meeting.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.445
- There's no time. It's got to be tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

12:36.489 --> 12:38.354
What's the rush?
I mean, I'd have to leave right now.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.880
You can't leave
before the fiesta.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.325
- Yeah, I can't leave now.
- It's a really good script.

12:42.361 --> 12:44.386
- Yeah, what is it?
- It's called "Danger Beach."

12:44.430 --> 12:47.558
- It's called "Danger Beach"?
- Sounds stupid.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.034
- It's a working title.
- I don't know. What do you think, girls?

12:50.069 --> 12:51.696
Should I do a movie
called "Danger Beach"?

12:51.737 --> 12:54.137
- Don't think so.
- Nobody here likes it.

12:54.173 --> 12:57.040
- It's a working title.
- Yeah? Well it's not working for me.

12:57.076 --> 12:59.408
- I'm getting hungry.
- Vince, you got to trust me.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.312
I do trust you, E.
And I love you and I miss you.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.680
But I'm not going
back right now.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.117
Not on a day like this.
Not when Maria's cooking.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.745
She cooks like you
wouldn't believe.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.154
- Hey, I cook good things too.
- Course you do.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.488
- Vince!
- E, I got to go. I'm being rude.

13:13.526 --> 13:16.962
- Okay, I'll talk to you later, E.
- Bye.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.692
Later, sucker.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.715
Look, man.
Don't worry.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.876
I'll carry
The Murphy Group.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.422
What do you mean
he's not coming back?

13:44.456 --> 13:46.651
I mean, you want me
to say it in Spanish?

13:46.692 --> 13:49.627
Why do I have 300 clients
and you have two

13:49.662 --> 13:53.120
and you don't seem to care that one
of them is retiring in his prime?

13:53.165 --> 13:55.156
What is it you think
I can do, Ari?

13:55.201 --> 13:57.294
- You two have a little rift?
- What?

13:57.336 --> 13:59.167
Playing the "Medellin"
blame game?

13:59.205 --> 14:01.799
Let it go
like a bad piece of pussy.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.275
Just forget that you smelled
it and move on.

14:04.310 --> 14:06.369
If he passes
on this thing now,

14:06.412 --> 14:09.506
he might as well be Cat Stevens
doing butterfly strokes

14:09.548 --> 14:12.244
in the Caspian Sea
searching for Mohammed.

14:12.284 --> 14:14.411
'Cause that's how he's gonna
be viewed in this town.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.080
Look, Ari, I spoke
to him, all right?

14:16.121 --> 14:17.713
I know him better than you.
He's not coming back.

14:17.756 --> 14:19.121
Well, then we're
going to him.

14:19.158 --> 14:21.058
Drama's the only one
who knows where he is.

14:21.093 --> 14:23.527
Call Drama and meet me
at the Van Nuys airport in 40 minuets.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.359
Oh really?
Are you supplying the plane?

14:25.397 --> 14:27.262
That's how much I care.

14:29.735 --> 14:31.669
- How'd it go?
- Shitty.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.434
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- No, man, I let you down.

14:34.473 --> 14:36.532
No you didn't. We'll get 'em next time.
Don't worry about it.

14:36.575 --> 14:38.372
- All right.
- Do me a favor though?

14:38.410 --> 14:39.672
- What's up?
- Drive me to the airport.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.737
Take my car for the night.

14:43.682 --> 14:46.549
Shit, fuck the audition.
Let's roll.

14:46.585 --> 14:49.110
You see what I'm talking
about, right, babe?

14:49.154 --> 14:50.917
I look awful
from this side.

14:50.956 --> 14:53.424
I wouldn't say awful,
but I see what you're saying.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.484
You're the only one
who gets me.

14:55.527 --> 14:57.256
Just let them shoot
you how they want

14:57.296 --> 14:59.491
and if it doesn't look good
they won't use it.

14:59.531 --> 15:02.591
Oh, baby, I love your naiveté,
but you don't get this town.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.569
You've got to cover your own
ass 'cause no one else will.

15:04.603 --> 15:06.594
They can say what they want,

15:06.639 --> 15:09.107
but I know the reason
I got recast for the "Models Inc." pilot

15:09.141 --> 15:11.769
was because the director
kept shooting me from the right side.

15:11.810 --> 15:14.802
That's why test scores said
teenage girls were scared of me.

15:14.847 --> 15:16.906
But how can anyone
be scared of you?

15:18.117 --> 15:20.585
- Shit. Who is it?
- It's Tommy, Drama.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.587
They got Ben Silverman
coming down from his office.

15:22.621 --> 15:24.248
You better get your ass
out here now.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.257
Jesus, the network chairman
is coming down right now.

15:28.294 --> 15:29.921
Just do what he says,
Johnny.

15:29.962 --> 15:31.452
I can't do that, baby.

15:31.497 --> 15:34.057
I struggled for 20 years
to get to where I am.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.659
I'm not gonna let them force
me to looking stupid again.

15:36.702 --> 15:39.136
- I won't do it, no way.
- Drama!

15:39.171 --> 15:40.866
Hey, Tommy, thanks.
But you tell Silverman

15:40.906 --> 15:42.965
I'm not doing it.
Not for him, not for no one.

15:43.008 --> 15:45.203
Johnny,
you have me so worried.

15:45.244 --> 15:47.906
Hold on one second, baby.
One second. Yeah?

15:47.947 --> 15:50.541
Drama, I need to know exactly
where you sent Vince to in Mexico.

15:50.582 --> 15:52.072
No go, E.
It's a hideaway.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.108
Vince said nobody gets to go
unless he says so.

15:54.153 --> 15:56.587
- Drama, he's coming.
- E, I can't talk right now.

15:56.622 --> 15:59.022
Drama, it's an emergency.

16:01.026 --> 16:03.494
An emergency?
Is baby bro in trouble?

16:03.529 --> 16:04.860
Yeah, kind of.

16:06.332 --> 16:08.232
I'm on my way.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.792
Baby, I've got to fly.
Vince is in trouble.

16:10.836 --> 16:12.463
I'll call you back
in two minutes, okay?

16:12.504 --> 16:14.369
- Tweet.
- Chirp.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.170
- Johnny Chase.
- Mr. Chairman.

16:18.210 --> 16:20.075
Shoot me any way you want.

16:20.112 --> 16:22.478
I've got to get to Mexico.

16:24.216 --> 16:26.650
Fucking waste of time.

16:37.463 --> 16:39.658
I could use another shot
if you guys are gonna do this.

16:57.282 --> 17:00.547
Boss, the plane.
The plane.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.554
How many times you gonna do
that joke, Turtle?

17:02.588 --> 17:04.419
Till it don't
get a laugh, baby.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.788
- Come on, Carol, that was funny, right?
- Eh.

17:20.071 --> 17:22.404
Fresh air.

17:22.441 --> 17:24.840
- Oh my God.
- Jesus.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.071
- Look at you.
- E, what's up, bud?

17:27.112 --> 17:30.411
- Nice suit.
- I love it. Good to see you.

17:33.218 --> 17:36.745
Wow, you guys must be really desperate
to come running down here.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.622
Listen, the producer
Carl Ertz, six for six.

17:39.658 --> 17:40.955
Yeah, I know Carl.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.984
Yeah, he makes 'em for cheap
and they make big bucks.

17:43.028 --> 17:44.962
It's a perfect way
for you to come back strong, Vince,

17:44.997 --> 17:47.295
on a movie you don't have to carry 'cause
the genre already has a built-in audience.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.061
Oh yeah?
Is there any kind of role in this movie?

17:49.101 --> 17:50.728
One that requires me
to act?

17:50.769 --> 17:53.203
Yeah, the same kind
of role Shia LaBeouf had in "Disturbia."

17:53.238 --> 17:55.672
You look scared a few times,
smile so girls want to fuck you

17:55.707 --> 17:57.834
and then laugh your way all the way
to the next "Raiders of the Lost Ark."

17:57.876 --> 17:59.275
- Boom!
- Sounds challenging.

17:59.311 --> 18:01.973
Listen, we need to get
the 18-25-year-olds back.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.948
The ones that have
forgotten you exist.

18:03.982 --> 18:05.279
They've forgotten
that I exist?

18:05.317 --> 18:07.012
Don't take it
personally, bro.

18:07.052 --> 18:08.576
The whole country's
on meth.

18:08.620 --> 18:11.111
- So what do you think, Vince?
- I don't know.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.124
I don't feel like
running back right now

18:13.158 --> 18:15.217
for a non-challenging
career move.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.728
We're having a good time here.
Even Turtle's getting laid.

18:17.763 --> 18:21.062
- Yeah, a lot.
- It's vacation pussy. Anyone can get that.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.466
You see these girls back in the States,
they won't even look your way.

18:23.502 --> 18:25.834
I think you're arguing against our
point there, Drama.

18:25.871 --> 18:28.897
Look, we are desperate.
We haven't had an offer in six months.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.000
You guys are starting
to sound alike.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.307
Starting to look
alike too.

18:33.345 --> 18:34.744
Vinnie, listen.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.044
What happens if another
offer doesn't come in?

18:37.082 --> 18:38.743
It may not.
What then?

18:38.784 --> 18:40.911
What if one doesn't?
You think I'm gonna suffer?

18:40.953 --> 18:43.114
I mean, come on.
Look at this place.

18:43.155 --> 18:45.487
I live like a king
for $79 a day.

18:45.524 --> 18:47.958
I got great food,
fantastic women,

18:47.993 --> 18:50.985
and I wake up every morning
with a big fat smile on my face.

18:51.029 --> 18:52.826
Look at you guys.

18:52.865 --> 18:55.698
Fighting the rat race.
Wearing uncomfortable shoes.

18:55.734 --> 18:57.258
Angry all the time.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.293
Life is not all about
making money and movies.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.806
- At least mine isn't.
- Vince!

19:01.840 --> 19:04.741
Ari, it's siesta time.
It's time to chill.

19:04.776 --> 19:07.176
We'll talk about it
over dinner.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.204
- We're not staying for dinner.
- I know.

19:10.249 --> 19:12.240
You guys should stay.
The food's real good.

19:12.284 --> 19:15.447
But know if you do stay,
you guys are sharing the hammock.

19:18.023 --> 19:20.548
Vince, can I talk to you
alone for a second?

19:20.592 --> 19:22.822
Is it gonna be another one
of your famous pep talks?

19:22.861 --> 19:24.522
Call it what you want.
Two seconds, come on.

19:24.563 --> 19:26.531
Excuse me, ladies.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.401
You really want to go out
on the bottom, Vince?

19:30.435 --> 19:32.699
- Bottom?
- Yeah.

19:32.738 --> 19:35.036
"Medellin" sucked
and the whole world knows it.

19:35.073 --> 19:37.633
You disappear now that's all people
are gonna remember you for.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.644
When did I ever care
about what people think?

19:39.678 --> 19:42.442
All right, maybe you can go
out like this, but I can't.

19:42.481 --> 19:44.005
I'm the one that
found "Medellin."

19:44.049 --> 19:45.914
I got to spend the rest
of my life thinking

19:45.951 --> 19:48.283
I ruined my best friend's career
'cause I couldn't make it good?

19:48.320 --> 19:51.289
I know how good you are, Vince, and I
know you got big things ahead of you.

19:51.323 --> 19:54.554
You've done everything for me, buddy,
but you've got to do one more thing.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.857
You've got to help me let you get back
to where you were supposed to be.

19:56.895 --> 19:58.863
Then you can retire
on any beach you want

19:58.897 --> 20:00.728
and you won't have to worry
about me killing myself.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.757
That's a pep talk?

20:07.105 --> 20:10.404
All right, E.
I'll go for you.

20:10.442 --> 20:12.501
Thank you.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.034
Hey, Ari,

20:14.079 --> 20:16.377
get the plane ready.
We're going home.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.406
Wait wait wait,
I need an hour.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.975
Carol, I'm leaving
tonight, baby.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.884
You need to shave.

20:27.526 --> 20:30.495
- My face feels weird.
- I feel you, bro.

20:30.529 --> 20:33.396
I felt like an amputee when I played
that high school swimmer

20:33.432 --> 20:35.525
with alopecia
back on "7th Heaven."

20:35.567 --> 20:37.501
Vince with alopecia would still look
better than you do, Drama.

20:37.536 --> 20:39.265
You know, this script
is not that bad.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.067
Will you stop reading and driving,
please, before you kill us?

20:41.106 --> 20:43.666
Sorry, I picked it up on the can
this morning and I couldn't put it down.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.233
It is good.
You were right, E.

20:45.277 --> 20:47.006
- Real dumb title though.
- Real dumb.

20:47.045 --> 20:48.410
Reminds me
of a Hitchcock movie.

20:48.447 --> 20:50.244
What do you guys think
of "M is for Amnesia"?

20:50.282 --> 20:53.115
I think the tropical sun
melted your brain.

20:53.151 --> 20:55.210
- No good, Vin?
- No good, Turtle.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.688
- What about "High Tide"?
- I like that.

20:57.723 --> 20:59.384
That is pretty good,
actually.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.914
See? I have a purpose here.
What's yours, Drama?

21:00.959 --> 21:03.086
It's my day off.
Get off my ass.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.161
- There he is.
- What are you doing here?

21:07.199 --> 21:09.531
- Moral support.
- I told you I don't need any.

21:09.568 --> 21:11.934
- Well, I'm here just in case.
- It'll be fine.

21:11.970 --> 21:13.995
Tear it up, baby bro.
Tear it up.

21:14.039 --> 21:16.633
You're back, Vin.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.375
This is what you losers
do all these years? You wait?

21:21.413 --> 21:24.041
Sometimes when I'm alone
I do that.

21:26.518 --> 21:29.078
- Ha ha!
- I'm going back to the office.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.919
- Later.
- I got girl on girl too, Ari.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.488
Will you roll up the window,
you idiot?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.298
Look, Vincent Chase.

21:50.342 --> 21:52.139
I thought he was dead.

21:52.177 --> 21:54.338
Only till
he's alive again.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.447
- Oh Jesus.
- What?

22:01.453 --> 22:04.650
- So, Mexico, huh?
- It was phenomenal.

22:04.690 --> 22:06.180
I'm more of a Caribbean
guy myself.

22:06.224 --> 22:08.351
Lot of history.

22:08.393 --> 22:10.361
So, "Danger Beach."

22:10.395 --> 22:12.761
You know, I have to say,
I read it on the plane

22:12.798 --> 22:14.493
and it is really
really good.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.696
- You sound surprised.
- The title threw me at first.

22:17.736 --> 22:21.103
But it's a unique story and this character
is better than I've seen in a long time.

22:21.139 --> 22:23.266
Fantastic. And you know
we're working on the title now.

22:23.308 --> 22:26.209
What do you think
about "High Tide"?

22:26.244 --> 22:29.213
"High Tide."
I like that. I like that a lot.

22:29.247 --> 22:31.306
- Hi, Carl.
- It's got a... Adam.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.079
Nice to see you.
You know Vinnie Chase.

22:33.118 --> 22:34.881
I do.
I used to represent Johnny.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.148
Oh yeah, that's right.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.554
Crazy running into
you here.

22:38.590 --> 22:40.888
Indeed. Always good
to see you, Adam.

22:40.926 --> 22:43.019
Guess I'll talk
to you soon.

22:45.263 --> 22:47.254
I guess so.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.893
- He seems angry.
- He's an agent.

22:50.936 --> 22:52.494
They're all pricks.

22:54.806 --> 22:56.865
Ari Gold's office.

22:56.908 --> 22:59.638
Really?
Interesting.

23:02.514 --> 23:04.277
Adam Davies calling.

23:04.316 --> 23:06.375
For me?

23:08.620 --> 23:11.180
If you need a kidney, Adam,
I'm not willing to donate.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.885
But I am willing to watch you slowly die
if you're looking for that kind of thing.

23:13.925 --> 23:17.156
- You lost your touch, Ari.
- Oh yeah? How's that?

23:17.195 --> 23:20.130
Ertz doesn't want Vince.
You were set up.

23:20.165 --> 23:22.258
He was just trying to force
me to close Emile Hirsch

23:22.300 --> 23:24.495
at $2 million less
than I wanted.

23:24.536 --> 23:27.027
Explain to your client that you dragged
him back here for nothing.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.097
I'm gonna skull-fuck
you, Davies!

23:29.141 --> 23:30.802
You just did, Ari.

23:30.842 --> 23:32.639
- What did he want?
- Fuck you, Yoko.

23:32.677 --> 23:34.702
Get E on the phone.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.613
- I will beat Carl Ertz's ass.
- Will you calm down?

23:37.649 --> 23:39.207
No no, no calm.
Let's go to his house

23:39.251 --> 23:40.741
and beat him
in front of his kids.

23:40.786 --> 23:42.913
I know where he lives.
I used to drive him home from softball.

23:42.954 --> 23:45.115
I still see him at the rub and tug
every now and then.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.886
You have a girlfriend.
I thought you didn't do that anymore.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.654
I go there
for facials, asshole.

23:48.693 --> 23:50.217
Come on, Turtle,
let's go kill Ertz.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.253
Guys, will you stop it?
I appreciate the backing

23:52.297 --> 23:53.821
but no one's killing Ertz,
all right?

23:53.865 --> 23:55.856
You should kill me
'cause it's my fault again.

23:55.901 --> 23:57.892
Shut up.
You couldn't have seen this coming.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.370
Nobody could have.
And you didn't push me into "Medellin."

24:00.405 --> 24:02.100
We did it together.

24:02.140 --> 24:03.664
Well, thanks.
I appreciate that.

24:03.708 --> 24:05.300
Although you did
approve the makeup.

24:05.343 --> 24:07.868
The guy said it was gonna look good
on film. How am I supposed to know?

24:07.913 --> 24:10.473
It didn't.

24:11.783 --> 24:13.808
Oh boy.
So what now?

24:13.852 --> 24:15.877
- Back to Mexico?
- Are you out of your mind?

24:15.921 --> 24:16.979
I'm not going out like this.

24:17.022 --> 24:18.421
I thought you don't care
what people think?

24:18.457 --> 24:21.221
- I care a little.
- You're gonna be bigger than ever, Vince.

24:21.259 --> 24:23.159
You're gonna take
back the throne.

24:23.195 --> 24:25.925
If I made it back,
so can you, baby bro.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.955
Thanks, Johnny.

24:37.008 --> 24:38.771
It's right here. Kill the lights.
Kill 'em.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.472
- What are we gonna do?
- I'm gonna golf, you're gonna caddy.

24:45.917 --> 24:47.782
Five iron.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.257
Whoa whoa whoa.
The Maserati, really?

24:53.291 --> 24:55.725
It is nice.

25:05.804 --> 25:08.136
- What are you, the Godfather?
- I'm sending a message.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.368
- Saying what?
- Aquaman will be back.

25:11.305 --> 25:17.191
