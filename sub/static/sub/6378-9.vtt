Two thousand years...

50:15.137 --> 50:15.546
Two thousand years...

50:15.554 --> 50:16.714
Two thousand years...

50:18.015 --> 50:18.424
...and I can still be surprised.

50:18.432 --> 50:19.717
...and I can still be surprised.

50:25.814 --> 50:26.223
In this, | see God.

50:26.232 --> 50:27.597
In this, | see God.

50:51.632 --> 50:52.041
Goodbye, Godric.

50:52.049 --> 50:52.458
Goodbye, Godric.

50:52.466 --> 50:53.626
Goodbye, Godric.
