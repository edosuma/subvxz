00:41.129 --> 00:42.837
Argh!

00:53.684 --> 00:55.676
Get off!

00:55.811 --> 00:58.099
Get off!

01:01.024 --> 01:03.942
(Indistinct police radio)

01:04.069 --> 01:06.394
Call said one dead body.

01:06.530 --> 01:09.484
Caught him red-handed. Ben Jennings.

01:13.495 --> 01:17.540
Nick Stokes, Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
You wanna tell us what happened here?

01:22.504 --> 01:23.879
You have anything to say?

01:26.008 --> 01:28.166
You don't have to talk to us.

01:29.845 --> 01:31.220
He'll talk to us.

02:09.133 --> 02:10.627
See the lividity?

02:11.845 --> 02:14.134
Blood settled at the time of death.

02:14.264 --> 02:17.514
Body's been moved from the murder scene.
Impound his car.

02:19.436 --> 02:22.271
- Sorry, guys, I lost you at the fork.
- My bad, Sara.

02:25.692 --> 02:28.362
Let's process this guy, shall we?

02:28.445 --> 02:30.651
Officer, would you uncuff him, please?

02:38.705 --> 02:41.540
OK, make like a scarecrow for me, partner.

02:42.793 --> 02:44.501
Arms out, away from your body.

02:44.628 --> 02:47.333
That's it. Stay just like that.

02:54.012 --> 02:55.554
Give me your right foot.

02:55.681 --> 02:57.673
Other right.

02:57.808 --> 02:59.635
Put it down. Lift it up.

03:01.561 --> 03:03.305
Hold still

03:05.482 --> 03:07.973
Possible secondary transfer.

03:10.737 --> 03:12.896
Got some red fibres.

03:15.659 --> 03:17.652
Other foot. Lift it up.

03:17.786 --> 03:19.280
Put it down.

03:24.042 --> 03:27.826
No defensive wounds. No haematomas.

03:27.963 --> 03:31.581
Victim didn't fight back.
Probably didn't see it coming.

03:34.511 --> 03:38.509
Matthew! Tag that body for special processing,
VIP room.

03:38.640 --> 03:42.223
Don't wash until I get there,
and don't touch his fingernails.

03:52.446 --> 03:56.278
DB, Mediterranean Casino, Women's Spa.

03:59.119 --> 04:03.117
Body of Shelley Danvers.
DOB: 10/10/81.

04:03.248 --> 04:05.241
Employee walked in to get towels.

04:08.128 --> 04:10.251
Found her here.

04:17.721 --> 04:21.220
A young woman, healthy,
just reading a magazine.

04:21.350 --> 04:23.508
Then all of a sudden she DFOs?

04:24.728 --> 04:28.062
Doesn't fill out.
That's what the night manager says.

04:30.859 --> 04:32.104
Miss?

04:33.904 --> 04:35.102
Excuse me.

04:36.239 --> 04:38.149
We're from the Crime Lab.

04:39.952 --> 04:43.736
- You found the deceased?
- Yes, I was um...

04:43.872 --> 04:47.122
just getting some towels
and I walked in and she was there

04:47.250 --> 04:50.002
Hey, Brass. You touched this body?

04:50.128 --> 04:51.788
Yeah, I was born yesterday.

04:51.922 --> 04:54.958
Well, it looks as if this sash may have been tied
by somebody else.

04:58.011 --> 05:02.258
Miss? Do you know anything
about re-dressing the body?

05:02.391 --> 05:04.798
Well, she was naked. I thought she should be

05:04.935 --> 05:08.185
- covered
- Did you move the body here, too?

05:09.356 --> 05:11.681
Guests were looking in. I put a robe on her.

05:11.817 --> 05:14.308
It's not like it's a crime or anything.

05:14.444 --> 05:15.773
Actually, it is.

05:15.904 --> 05:19.107
It makes us doubt the circumstances
surrounding the victim's death.

05:23.787 --> 05:25.032
Flour, maybe?

05:26.206 --> 05:28.199
But what kind?

05:28.333 --> 05:30.326
All-purpose? Self-rising?

05:30.460 --> 05:32.453
Pastry?

05:32.587 --> 05:34.794
Trace will probably have a better idea.

05:37.551 --> 05:41.169
I'll get DNA to see if we have bits of Ben
under the fingernails.

05:41.305 --> 05:43.974
What about the neck? Any fibres in the wound?

05:44.099 --> 05:46.851
- You told me to wait for you.
- That hasn't stopped you yet.

05:46.977 --> 05:50.809
I did observe some fibres in the wound.
I didn't collect them, though.

05:50.939 --> 05:52.599
Be my guest.

05:58.155 --> 05:59.779
Yellow.

05:59.906 --> 06:03.026
Not cotton. Satin, maybe.

06:08.332 --> 06:10.324
Dress shirt,

06:10.459 --> 06:11.573
but no tie.

06:11.710 --> 06:14.035
Strangled with his own tie?

06:15.922 --> 06:18.710
Find me on the flour.

06:20.928 --> 06:23.501
Shelley Danvers. Appointment, 8 o'clock.

06:23.639 --> 06:27.683
Miss Marita, did the deceased use
the jacuzzi facilities this evening?

06:27.809 --> 06:29.387
Not that I remember, no.

06:30.938 --> 06:32.598
What, you don't believe me?

06:32.731 --> 06:34.356
Well, you lied to us before.

06:34.483 --> 06:37.021
It's er, not uncommon to drown in a jacuzzi.

06:37.152 --> 06:40.568
Hair gets caught in the whirl,
a person gets dragged under.

06:40.697 --> 06:42.322
The hotel wouldn't be considered

06:42.449 --> 06:44.276
- unsafe
- That didn't happen here.

06:44.409 --> 06:46.201
She did not drown on these premises.

06:46.328 --> 06:48.997
If she did, the coroner would find water
in her lungs.

06:49.081 --> 06:52.284
But it would be worse hearing it from him
than from you.

06:52.417 --> 06:56.000
Oliver Dunne. Corporate lawyer, father of two.

06:56.129 --> 07:00.257
- You get all that from his er... dentals?
- His wife, widow.

07:00.384 --> 07:03.420
- She came down to ID his property.
- .380s?

07:03.553 --> 07:07.136
Last one I recovered
entered through his abdominals,

07:07.266 --> 07:10.516
pierced the liver, lodged in the oblique.

07:10.644 --> 07:12.720
But that's not what killed him, is it?

07:12.854 --> 07:17.184
We pulled a yellow fibre out of the neck wound.
I think it's from his tie.

07:17.317 --> 07:20.152
You might be right. He died of asphyxiation.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.771
The tie probably closed the windpipe.

07:24.950 --> 07:28.650
Without oxygen to his lungs,
the capillaries wither and dry up.

07:28.787 --> 07:30.863
Whole pulmonary system shut down.

07:30.998 --> 07:35.660
What you may have here is
the smallest sliver of the murder weapon.

07:35.794 --> 07:38.878
Why would a guy shoot a man three times

07:39.006 --> 07:41.129
and then strangle him with his own tie?

07:41.258 --> 07:42.717
I cannot tell you why

07:42.843 --> 07:45.334
but I might be able to tell you where -
a pizza shop.

07:45.470 --> 07:48.222
The flour on Oliver Dunne
has a low gluten content,

07:48.348 --> 07:50.056
T% protein.

07:50.183 --> 07:52.556
Typical of flour used to make cakes,
that kind of thing.

07:52.686 --> 07:54.679
So, why did you rule out bakeries?

07:54.813 --> 07:57.482
The subtype of flour is another subtype.
Double zero.

07:57.566 --> 08:00.139
It's a very fine flour
used only in pizza baking ovens.

08:00.277 --> 08:03.147
On and Trace picked up some oregano
in the sample

08:03.280 --> 08:06.234
When are you set to interview Ben?

08:06.366 --> 08:08.857
You're the registered owner of a Lorcin.380.

08:08.994 --> 08:12.612
Takes the same calibre bullet
as the slugs we took out of the victim.

08:12.748 --> 08:14.824
So, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

08:14.958 --> 08:16.785
Where's your gun?

08:16.918 --> 08:18.294
I lost it.

08:18.420 --> 08:19.962
Do you think we believe that?

08:20.088 --> 08:22.247
- Do you think
- Are you employed, Ben?

08:23.675 --> 08:25.668
Yeah. Yeah, um...

08:26.845 --> 08:28.636
This place called Dante's Pizzeria.

08:28.764 --> 08:31.718
- It's behind the Strato.
- You make pizzas?

08:31.850 --> 08:34.258
Well, I deliver the pizzas.

08:34.394 --> 08:36.885
It's too hot back there with all the ovens
and stuff.

08:38.565 --> 08:39.846
Do you er...

08:39.982 --> 08:42.474
ever come into contact with the baking flour

08:42.611 --> 08:44.402
at Dante's?

08:44.529 --> 08:46.522
Mostly pizza boxes.

08:48.700 --> 08:49.863
Why?

08:49.993 --> 08:52.116
Well, cos we found flour on the victim.

08:53.246 --> 08:54.789
And it's the kind that's used

08:54.915 --> 08:57.204
to make pizza

08:57.334 --> 08:58.745
Can you explain that?

08:58.877 --> 09:00.953
No.

09:01.088 --> 09:02.665
Ben,

09:03.799 --> 09:05.672
why don't you earn yourself some points

09:05.801 --> 09:08.470
by telling me
what the science is gonna tell me anyway?

09:08.595 --> 09:10.339
Well, I don't have to talk.

09:11.515 --> 09:13.389
No.

09:13.517 --> 09:15.308
But we're gonna figure it out.

09:15.435 --> 09:18.223
If you know so much about these murders,
why do you need me?

09:18.355 --> 09:19.849
Murders?

09:22.442 --> 09:24.186
There are more bodies?

09:29.074 --> 09:30.948
(Beeping)

09:31.076 --> 09:33.069
I feel like I'm mowing a lawn.

09:34.204 --> 09:37.454
What is that, a beer can? Soda can?

09:37.582 --> 09:39.575
Zilch.

09:41.503 --> 09:42.831
Zilch.

09:42.963 --> 09:45.288
Don't tell me, more zilch?

09:46.800 --> 09:49.836
(Beeping gets louder)
- Whoa! Whoa! Point of disturbance.

09:49.970 --> 09:51.429
Hold up.

09:54.933 --> 09:57.305
Isolate it

09:57.436 --> 09:59.096
Right there.

10:20.792 --> 10:23.081
Any more bodies you want to tell me about?

10:26.006 --> 10:27.999
No.

10:28.133 --> 10:30.458
We're gonna radar this whole hillside.

10:35.599 --> 10:37.591
Sometimes...

10:39.019 --> 10:43.811
...when I leave a crime scene where I've been
particularly involved with a dead body,

10:44.942 --> 10:46.934
I sit in my car and it hits me.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.313
How close I was.

10:52.324 --> 10:55.444
How... heavy the body is.

10:57.412 --> 10:59.405
The texture of the body.

11:00.540 --> 11:02.118
How it feels.

11:02.250 --> 11:04.243
You know.

11:11.510 --> 11:12.885
Mr Grissom.

11:17.307 --> 11:18.718
I'm not a bad person.

11:18.850 --> 11:21.057
You're not a bad person?

11:22.771 --> 11:24.146
Then what are you?

11:33.115 --> 11:34.229
Oh,

11:34.366 --> 11:37.201
I hope that's Shelley Danvers,
the woman from the hotel spa.

11:37.327 --> 11:38.572
Yep, she's next.

11:38.704 --> 11:42.155
Well, it's about time.
You guys finished with day-shift runover, huh?

11:42.291 --> 11:46.288
- I hate it when you CSI guys get territorial.
- Well, the victim's family hate it

11:46.420 --> 11:49.124
- when we don't.
- I'll take it from here, David.

11:50.382 --> 11:51.627
Good morning.

11:51.758 --> 11:53.502
Catherine.

11:53.635 --> 11:57.929
No serosanguineous fluid expunged
from the mouth or nose.

11:58.056 --> 12:02.136
- She didn't drown.
- Rules out your jacuzzi theory.

12:02.269 --> 12:03.431
Anything probative?

12:03.562 --> 12:07.560
- Bright red lividity extending down the body.
- From?

12:07.691 --> 12:09.565
Well, heatstroke, possibly.

12:09.693 --> 12:13.607
Stroke could cause multiple organ failure.
And if I'm right...

12:13.739 --> 12:16.230
Cover her up.

12:16.366 --> 12:20.364
- Hey, I still have to do the post. Catherine!
- Brass I need you to get records

12:20.495 --> 12:22.868
from that hotel spa, and a warrant if we need it.

12:22.998 --> 12:24.540
Yep, that's right.

12:24.666 --> 12:26.042
Bye.

12:26.168 --> 12:28.160
- Oh, it's on.
- Yeah.

12:28.295 --> 12:30.964
Was our girl staying with anyone at that hotel?

12:31.048 --> 12:32.625
Er... yeah.

12:32.758 --> 12:34.750
Tina... Tina Kolas.

12:34.885 --> 12:38.301
Best friends from Terre Haute, Indiana.
They flew here on a package. Why?

12:38.430 --> 12:41.099
We need someone to give us the truth
about last night.

12:50.859 --> 12:53.267
Gil Grissom?

12:53.403 --> 12:54.732
Father.

12:54.863 --> 12:56.405
Benjamin's a member of my parish.

12:56.531 --> 12:59.485
The officer won't let me talk to him.
He said you were in charge.

12:59.618 --> 13:01.694
Of this crime scene.

13:01.828 --> 13:03.868
He needs spiritual guidance.

13:09.544 --> 13:11.870
Yeah, I imagine he does.

13:13.048 --> 13:15.586
Ah, then you'd have no problem
with my talking to him.

13:15.717 --> 13:17.591
It's the eleventh hour. I'd expect it.

13:17.719 --> 13:19.095
Eleventh hour?

13:19.221 --> 13:22.720
When the reality of their actions set in,
they usually turn to religion.

13:22.849 --> 13:24.759
Can you think of a better time?

13:34.194 --> 13:36.863
OK, hold it. That's enough. Let's dust him.

13:53.797 --> 13:56.169
No ligature mark s.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.091
Different from the first guy

13:58.218 --> 14:03.213
Let's see if this laceration on this guy's forehead
is consistent with the kid's shovel.

14:04.808 --> 14:06.386
Hey,

14:06.518 --> 14:08.096
I got a wallet here.

14:14.026 --> 14:15.817
Ramirez

14:15.944 --> 14:19.859
Kenny. A 25-year-old Latino
and a 42-year-old white guy?

14:19.990 --> 14:23.573
Strangers. It doesn't make sense.
There's no connection.

14:23.702 --> 14:27.153
Well, it obviously wasn't a robbery.

14:27.289 --> 14:30.539
Hey, O'Riley.
What's the matter, man, A/C not working?

14:30.667 --> 14:32.660
I was out with Dispatch.

14:32.794 --> 14:36.044
Oliver Dunne's car was just found
by the highway patrol.

14:36.173 --> 14:38.249
Abandoned in an AvCon station off 2-15.

14:38.383 --> 14:41.799
They didn't happen to find another car there,
did they?

14:42.971 --> 14:44.964
Yeah.

14:45.098 --> 14:46.676
Registered to a... Ramirez.

14:48.268 --> 14:50.308
Yeah, gas station.

15:00.739 --> 15:02.399
And you can verify

15:02.532 --> 15:06.364
that when Shelley went to the spa last night
she was gonna use the dry sauna?

15:06.495 --> 15:08.571
We'd been drinking martinis for three days.

15:08.705 --> 15:12.074
Shelley said the sauna would detox her
You know clean her out

15:15.837 --> 15:18.411
Cath.

15:18.548 --> 15:22.842
- Whose shirt is this?
- Mine. Shelley and I got in a fight over it.

15:22.970 --> 15:27.181
- When?
- Yesterday. I caught her trying it on

15:27.307 --> 15:28.967
and I said "Give it back"

15:29.101 --> 15:31.426
and we started fighting over it,
you know, tug-of-war.

15:31.561 --> 15:32.510
It ripped in two.

15:32.646 --> 15:34.057
We fell back laughing.

15:37.234 --> 15:39.025
I'd give anything to have her back.

15:40.570 --> 15:44.734
- We're gonna take this shirt, if you don't mind.
- No, go ahead if it'll help.

15:44.866 --> 15:48.152
You said you have proof
that Shelley used the dry sauna.

15:48.287 --> 15:51.537
She called down from this phone.
Do they tape phone calls here?

15:51.665 --> 15:53.373
Hotel surveillance would love that

15:54.543 --> 15:57.212
Are you sure she used that phone
to make the appointment?

15:57.337 --> 15:58.167
Yeah.

16:01.717 --> 16:03.674
We're gonna take this as well.

16:03.802 --> 16:07.088
OK. But it doesn't have anything on it.

16:07.222 --> 16:10.140
That's OK. We do magic.

16:12.311 --> 16:15.015
Two men were shot and killed,
and you didn't see anything?

16:15.147 --> 16:16.096
Sorry.

16:16.231 --> 16:18.603
Come on, man,
you don't miss something like that.

16:18.734 --> 16:20.892
- What went on?
- A friend came with a new car,

16:21.028 --> 16:21.976
we took it for a drive.

16:22.112 --> 16:25.315
I'm afraid my boss will find out.
I was only gone five minutes.

16:25.449 --> 16:27.856
OK, all right. Just... just walk us through it.

16:27.993 --> 16:30.282
When did you know there'd been
a crime committed?

16:30.412 --> 16:32.820
Well, my buddy dropped me back here,

16:32.956 --> 16:35.079
and I noticed these two cars.

16:35.208 --> 16:36.667
I went to check them out.

16:45.218 --> 16:47.045
On my God!

16:50.349 --> 16:52.840
- I don't see any blood.
- Yeah, I hosed it down.

16:52.976 --> 16:54.803
- You what?
- It was freaking me out.

17:06.406 --> 17:08.980
H-Hello? Mr Grissom?

17:09.117 --> 17:10.362
Er...

17:13.079 --> 17:15.830
they told me out front I'd find you here.

17:20.212 --> 17:22.288
I don't see your visitor's badge.

17:22.422 --> 17:25.507
Priest's collar. People trust it.

17:26.843 --> 17:28.836
Most people.

17:28.971 --> 17:31.010
Even lapsed Catholics.

17:31.139 --> 17:32.931
What makes you think er...

17:34.059 --> 17:35.434
I was ever a Catholic?

17:35.560 --> 17:39.309
First time we met, you called me Father.
Only Romans do that.

17:39.439 --> 17:42.524
Everybody else, it's er, Reverend, or Minister.

17:42.651 --> 17:46.601
I wanted to know how your investigation
against Ben is going.

17:46.738 --> 17:48.316
This is his car.

17:48.448 --> 17:50.607
You know, you really shouldn't be here.

17:50.742 --> 17:53.613
I didn't come here to tamper with your evidence.

18:05.299 --> 18:08.917
He was a good kid. All through school.

18:09.052 --> 18:11.045
Still comes to Mass every Sunday

18:12.681 --> 18:14.674
If he has a problem...

18:16.018 --> 18:20.596
- it's trying to please people.
- Is that a problem?

18:20.731 --> 18:22.011
Can be.

18:32.868 --> 18:36.319
Luminol It reveals dried blood

18:58.685 --> 19:00.310
He wouldn't do this.

19:01.813 --> 19:03.094
I believe the car.

19:05.776 --> 19:07.768
"To whom much is given

19:09.112 --> 19:10.772
much will be expected."

19:15.369 --> 19:17.077
I'll leave you to your work.

19:23.669 --> 19:27.880
I told you we have no record Shelley Danvers
specifically used the dry sauna.

19:28.006 --> 19:29.833
That's OK, cos we do.

19:29.967 --> 19:32.504
ESDA can read this blank paper,

19:32.636 --> 19:34.712
see what's written on it.

19:34.846 --> 19:37.682
- Up to 14 layers.
- Sometimes a simple flashlight

19:37.808 --> 19:39.006
will do the trick.

19:39.142 --> 19:43.436
That's Miss Danvers' handwriting.
We confirm that.

19:43.563 --> 19:45.473
So, she took a sauna. What does that prove?

19:46.650 --> 19:48.643
She died of a heatstroke.

19:50.320 --> 19:54.021
The coroner just called in
with the results of his final post.

19:54.157 --> 19:57.740
Your sauna is kept in an optimal condition
for heatstroke. 182 degrees.

19:59.788 --> 20:03.122
That can kill a person if they're left
for longer than two hours.

20:03.250 --> 20:05.207
Especially if no-one checks up on them.

20:05.335 --> 20:07.079
A hotel employee is supposed to check

20:07.212 --> 20:10.996
on the various saunas every 15 minutes.
Hotel regulations, right?

20:11.133 --> 20:13.125
We er...

20:14.511 --> 20:17.962
...we got a copy of the check-up sheet.

20:19.474 --> 20:22.594
No hotel employee checked in on the sauna
after T:30pm.

20:24.104 --> 20:27.022
So, Shelley was in here from eight

20:27.149 --> 20:29.355
until... What time did you call 911?

20:32.446 --> 20:33.821
(Sighs) I, um...

20:33.947 --> 20:36.236
came in at closing, ten o'clock.

20:37.409 --> 20:39.117
Miss?

20:39.244 --> 20:40.988
Miss? Oh, my God!

20:41.121 --> 20:44.205
And you moved her into the locker room?

20:44.333 --> 20:47.583
- Put the robe on her?
- I was just trying to protect the hotel.

20:47.711 --> 20:49.668
From negligent homicide.

20:49.796 --> 20:52.750
They drill into us that the reputation of this hotel

20:52.883 --> 20:55.421
is everything

20:55.552 --> 20:59.420
- Murder scene was compromised.
- Pump jockey wasn't very helpful,

20:59.556 --> 21:03.885
but bullets pulled from victim one and victim two,

21:04.019 --> 21:05.394
identical striations.

21:05.520 --> 21:08.391
Bullets in both victims
were fired by the exact same weapon.

21:08.523 --> 21:12.853
A Lorcin.380. The same pistol
registered to a Benjamin Jennings.

21:12.986 --> 21:16.236
PD can prove through credit cards
that Ben frequents the gas station

21:16.365 --> 21:18.523
- where both vics were killed
- We can prove

21:18.659 --> 21:22.028
he transported those bodies in his vehicle,
based on the blood you found.

21:22.162 --> 21:23.277
And fibres.

21:24.831 --> 21:28.876
Recovered a burgundy fibre
from the sock of victim one

21:29.002 --> 21:32.252
Found the same fibre on the sock of victim two.

21:32.381 --> 21:34.669
We ID'd the fibres using the FTIR.

21:34.800 --> 21:39.378
- It's a polymer, used in vehicle carpeting.
- So, we went back to Ben's car.

21:42.516 --> 21:43.844
They're identical

21:43.976 --> 21:48.104
We got the standards from the car manufacturer.
The assigned name for the material

21:48.230 --> 21:49.973
is 12-Ounce Merlot Poly.

21:51.650 --> 21:53.643
Bottom line,

21:53.777 --> 21:54.940
he killed them.

21:56.113 --> 21:58.189
Good work, you guys.

21:59.366 --> 22:01.774
Very good.

22:01.910 --> 22:05.244
But you haven't proved murder.
You've proved burial.

22:05.372 --> 22:07.115
Excuse me?

22:07.249 --> 22:09.241
Victim blood on his clothes,

22:09.376 --> 22:10.787
under his nails...

22:10.919 --> 22:12.663
From burying them.

22:12.796 --> 22:15.714
Victim blood in his car.

22:15.841 --> 22:17.917
He transported them.

22:19.386 --> 22:22.340
Show me the gun. With Ben's prints on it.

22:22.472 --> 22:24.963
Gunshot residue, the ligature...

22:25.100 --> 22:28.136
The holes in Christ's hands, doubting Thomas?

22:28.270 --> 22:31.390
Yes. Empirical evidence.
Saint Thomas was ahead of us all.

22:33.108 --> 22:35.813
Does this have anything to do... with the priest

22:35.944 --> 22:38.186
that's been coming around here?

22:38.322 --> 22:41.572
No, it has to do with the evidence.

22:41.700 --> 22:45.994
Well, it's our job to present the DA with
the best evidence possible, let a jury decide.

22:46.121 --> 22:49.122
Anything else we're playing judge

22:51.043 --> 22:53.249
The evidence doesn't get any better than this.

23:01.595 --> 23:04.512
OK. Ship it. Show it to the DA.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.510
All right.

23:14.024 --> 23:15.602
Anyone up for breakfast?

23:15.734 --> 23:18.272
I'm up for a shower and tucking my daughter in.

23:18.403 --> 23:20.396
Football. Widescreen.

23:20.530 --> 23:22.523
Well, I guess I'll go see Tina alone.

23:24.242 --> 23:26.734
Hotel tells me she's down playing quarter slots.

23:28.747 --> 23:31.867
I thought we solved this case. What did you get?

23:32.000 --> 23:35.037
Well, my guy in the hotel lounge
tells me that Tina and Shelley

23:35.170 --> 23:39.120
were having a cat fight over some dude
named Jeremy the day she died.

23:39.258 --> 23:42.591
That's probably how the shirt really got ripped.

23:42.719 --> 23:45.886
Don't ring her bell till we re-examine our case.

23:46.014 --> 23:48.386
Misunderstood the priest?

23:48.517 --> 23:50.094
How?

23:50.227 --> 23:53.810
I looked deeper into the evidence,
not deeper into Ben's character.

23:54.982 --> 23:56.606
Benjamin Corey Jennings

23:56.733 --> 23:58.275
Non-violent crimes.

24:00.779 --> 24:03.068
Roger Jennings Brother Armed robbery

24:03.198 --> 24:05.440
Past convictions, breaking and entering,

24:05.575 --> 24:08.245
assault with great bodily harm

24:09.413 --> 24:12.283
Paroled 9/2T/2000. This...

24:12.416 --> 24:14.159
this guy's hardcore

24:14.293 --> 24:16.415
He's looking at his third strike here.

24:19.756 --> 24:21.464
What's going on?

24:25.220 --> 24:28.091
- You know how we pushed him to file on Ben?
- Yeah.

24:28.223 --> 24:30.595
We might have been wrong.

24:31.768 --> 24:33.761
Tell me about your brother.

24:37.441 --> 24:40.145
We know that you only buried the bodies.

24:41.320 --> 24:43.312
So, what happened?

24:45.157 --> 24:47.114
Did he threaten you?

24:51.121 --> 24:52.663
Ben?

25:12.768 --> 25:14.677
Did you learn to throw pizzas in prison,

25:14.811 --> 25:16.804
Roger?

25:18.482 --> 25:20.688
Who the hell are you guys?

25:20.817 --> 25:23.569
Get out of my kitchen.

25:23.695 --> 25:28.073
Roger Jennings.
Armed robbery, breaking and entering.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.074
The kind of guy it wouldn't be a big jump

25:30.202 --> 25:32.527
- to murder
- What is this?

25:33.789 --> 25:35.746
Ever stop at the AvCon gas station?

25:35.874 --> 25:37.499
See these two guys?

25:37.626 --> 25:38.741
Nope.

25:39.503 --> 25:41.626
Don't know what you're talking about.

25:42.756 --> 25:45.508
My little brother got me this job.
I'm staying clean.

25:45.634 --> 25:48.339
Suppose I told you your brother said
you did these guys.

25:51.390 --> 25:53.098
Ben wouldn't do that.

25:53.225 --> 25:55.514
You did it directly after work.

25:56.728 --> 25:58.851
Using a 380 pistol

25:58.981 --> 26:02.314
And then you strangled one of the victims
with his own tie.

26:13.662 --> 26:15.785
Ben did them.

26:17.291 --> 26:18.453
Did you witness this?

26:18.583 --> 26:20.790
He told me about it.

26:20.919 --> 26:22.912
Look what I did! I just lost my head!

26:23.880 --> 26:27.795
- What am I supposed to do now?
- I'm on a short line, all right?

26:27.926 --> 26:29.634
You're on your own, man.

26:29.761 --> 26:32.928
- Rog, you gotta help me, man.
- You know I can't! What am I gonna do?

26:33.056 --> 26:34.088
Hun?

26:34.224 --> 26:36.466
It's your mess, you gotta deal with it.

26:36.602 --> 26:41.762
- What started the beef with the victims?
- I don't know. Tempers, I guess.

26:43.734 --> 26:45.144
Hey!

26:45.277 --> 26:48.444
Hey, man! I was here first!
Do you want to wait your turn?

26:53.118 --> 26:55.276
Bystander gets a little too nosy...

26:59.583 --> 27:01.291
...and he gets it, too.

27:02.753 --> 27:06.122
The perpetrator's hands
left flour on the victim's face.

27:06.256 --> 27:10.717
This was not from a gunshot.
This was something... a little more intimate.

27:14.348 --> 27:16.221
Shut up!

27:21.813 --> 27:27.768
When a person changes his mode of murder
from pistol to ligature, it's for one of two reasons.

27:27.903 --> 27:29.480
Entertainment,

27:29.613 --> 27:31.605
or necessity.

27:31.740 --> 27:33.816
Which was it for you?

27:33.951 --> 27:35.943
Neither.

27:36.078 --> 27:37.869
I told you, Ben strangled that guy.

27:37.996 --> 27:40.155
The flour said you did.

27:41.750 --> 27:43.707
I don't know what you're talking about.

27:45.504 --> 27:48.505
Anything on the list besides the tie?

27:48.632 --> 27:50.624
Nope.

27:51.760 --> 27:52.875
Hey, guys.

27:53.011 --> 27:57.223
Hey, guys. You can go ahead
and take off. I think we got it. Thanks.

27:57.349 --> 27:59.342
(Door creaks)

28:04.231 --> 28:06.556
Whoa.

28:20.122 --> 28:21.402
Hey.

28:21.540 --> 28:23.164
Dry-cleaning.

28:23.292 --> 28:26.043
Trailer's low rent, dry-cleaning's expensive.

28:38.765 --> 28:40.094
Sara

28:40.225 --> 28:42.301
Pizza man's not as smart as he think s.

28:42.436 --> 28:44.263
Dry-cleaning bakes in bloodstains.

28:46.064 --> 28:48.353
- Could be red sauce.
- Oh, now you're cautious.

28:48.483 --> 28:51.153
I'm just trying to put our mistakes to good use.

28:51.236 --> 28:53.063
OK.

28:53.196 --> 28:57.823
You wanna check the perimeter, and I'll see
if we have bloodstains or red sauce?

28:57.951 --> 28:59.280
OK.

30:11.942 --> 30:13.317
Haemoglobin.

30:13.443 --> 30:14.986
Take a look at this!

30:20.993 --> 30:23.281
Nick?

30:24.788 --> 30:26.781
Hey, Nick?

31:03.535 --> 31:05.195
(Gunshots)

31:05.329 --> 31:07.321
(Click)

31:09.458 --> 31:10.833
Jammed nun?

31:10.959 --> 31:12.999
Get anything instructive?

31:13.128 --> 31:14.587
Possibly.

31:14.713 --> 31:17.382
Blood from Jennings' denim shirt.

31:21.303 --> 31:23.710
Is the printer out of ink? ND, ND, ND.

31:23.847 --> 31:25.591
It means none detected.

31:25.724 --> 31:27.432
The dry-cleaning baked in the blood,

31:27.559 --> 31:30.264
and degraded it to the degree
that I just can't get a result.

31:30.395 --> 31:32.602
Try again. This could be victim blood. Try again.

31:32.731 --> 31:37.559
I nave tried. It's chemically impossible, Sara.
Nothing from nothing is nothing.

31:44.618 --> 31:47.025
Striations are different. See?

31:49.039 --> 31:53.617
There's no way I can say the bullets taken from
the victims were fired by Jennings' gun.

31:56.129 --> 31:58.122
So, he altered the barrel somehow.

31:58.257 --> 32:01.542
Yep. Changed how the bullet relates
to the barrel.

32:01.677 --> 32:05.211
So, when the bullet emerges,
its fine striae are altered.

32:05.347 --> 32:07.470
Any idea what he used?

32:09.601 --> 32:12.271
Whatever it was, it did the job.

32:12.354 --> 32:15.106
My evidence is no better. Total wash.

32:17.442 --> 32:19.815
(Sighs) We present this to the DA.

32:19.945 --> 32:22.862
Unfortunately, we've had this discussion before.

32:24.116 --> 32:26.523
The guilty brother's gonna walk.

32:57.441 --> 32:59.848
He's never been in any real trouble before.

33:01.820 --> 33:04.192
They'll go easy on him.

33:08.577 --> 33:11.531
The bullet jammed in the feed, didn't it?

33:13.040 --> 33:14.238
Please!

33:14.374 --> 33:15.537
(Click s)

33:15.667 --> 33:17.576
Shut up!

33:20.339 --> 33:23.008
So, it was necessity.

33:35.604 --> 33:38.273
Wait, are you saying
Shelley didn't die in the sauna?

33:38.357 --> 33:39.934
She died of heatstroke.

33:40.067 --> 33:43.103
But the stroke covered up
an underlying medical catastrophe.

33:43.236 --> 33:45.562
Like what? Shell was always healthy.

33:45.697 --> 33:47.571
She went into anaphylactic shock.

33:47.699 --> 33:51.400
Coroner says some of the indicators
are the same as a stroke.

33:51.536 --> 33:53.992
Renal failure, cerebral oedema.

33:54.122 --> 33:59.164
We missed it, until Captain Brass brought
your room service records to our attention.

33:59.294 --> 34:01.002
I don't understand.

34:01.129 --> 34:05.293
Well, maybe this'll help. The travel agency
contract you and Shelley signed.

34:05.425 --> 34:09.375
Under allergic reaction to foods
for Shelley Danvers, shellfish.

34:09.513 --> 34:11.505
As her best friend, you would know that.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.929
And then we nave this

34:14.059 --> 34:17.641
The hotel computer for your room,
T:01 pm on the day.

34:19.147 --> 34:25.684
A Taste From The Sea. A lovely terrine
of mild bisque, with puréed bits of Maine lobster.

34:25.821 --> 34:28.656
Puréed. Two bowls.

34:28.782 --> 34:32.696
She didn't know what she was eating
when it arrived, did she?

34:34.955 --> 34:37.871
Because she didn't order it. You did.

34:41.670 --> 34:44.623
We've got a machine,
known as the ESDA machine,

34:44.755 --> 34:48.505
which can er, read pen imprints.

34:48.635 --> 34:51.126
Well, the machine isolated this.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.172
Jeremy, drink s, 10 o'clock.

34:53.306 --> 34:56.141
Shelley made that date. That's her handwriting.

34:57.686 --> 35:00.011
Were you in the room when Jeremy called?

35:00.147 --> 35:02.139
I answered the phone.

35:02.274 --> 35:03.816
He asked for her.

35:03.942 --> 35:06.813
You killed her over a guy
you two met at a bar?

35:06.945 --> 35:09.317
Oh, I... I didn't mean to kill her.

35:09.448 --> 35:12.484
I...I...I thought she would just nave
an allergic reaction

35:12.618 --> 35:15.951
and then she wouldn't be able to make her date.
Get hives, or something.

35:16.079 --> 35:18.368
Well, her allergy kicked in in the sauna.

35:18.498 --> 35:20.824
Under the worst possible conditions.

35:20.959 --> 35:23.035
Trachea

35:23.170 --> 35:25.376
larynx

35:25.505 --> 35:27.415
tongue swelled

35:27.549 --> 35:29.838
Her pressure got so low,

35:29.968 --> 35:32.008
her blood quit running through her organs

35:32.137 --> 35:33.417
They shut down

35:39.311 --> 35:41.304
I didn't even like the guy.

35:41.438 --> 35:43.431
I just...

35:43.565 --> 35:46.519
I didn't wanna be left out.

35:50.530 --> 35:52.523
Miss Kolas you're under arrest

35:54.493 --> 35:56.485
Hey.

35:56.620 --> 35:58.328
DA's looking for you.

35:58.455 --> 36:00.780
- About?
- What, you think I read your messages?

36:02.000 --> 36:03.376
Top secret and urgent?

36:05.003 --> 36:08.538
- Hey, it's a gift, reading upside down.
The District Attorney

36:08.674 --> 36:13.134
is reportedly preparing to file homicide charges
against Benjamin Corey Jennings

36:13.262 --> 36:15.135
in the so-called "burial murders" case

36:15.264 --> 36:17.552
Jennings has been in police custody

36:17.683 --> 36:19.971
Guess we know what she was calling about.

36:20.102 --> 36:24.728
Since he was caught burying the first victim
Oliver Dunne in the national forest

36:24.856 --> 36:29.933
Don't you have enough cases at CSI?
Now you're telling me which ones I should take?

36:30.070 --> 36:33.937
There isn't a piece of evidence that says
the kid was even present at the murders.

36:34.074 --> 36:36.779
As a matter of fact, this is why I was hunting you.

36:36.910 --> 36:40.659
Jennings brought it in about an hour ago.
Chain of Custody - I can't touch it.

36:42.582 --> 36:44.456
The first victim was ligatured, right?

36:53.385 --> 36:55.958
Jennings says his little brother
asked him to hide it.

36:56.096 --> 36:58.089
Well, how convenient.

36:58.223 --> 37:00.216
The older brother brings it in,

37:00.350 --> 37:03.351
explaining why his epithelials
are all over the murder weapon.

37:03.478 --> 37:06.432
A jury doesn't understand epi... whatevers.

37:06.565 --> 37:10.693
Look, they understand a twisty tie,
and blood all over Ben's car seat.

37:10.819 --> 37:11.815
He set up his brother.

37:11.945 --> 37:16.073
Oh, come on, Grissom. They're both part of it.
And if I can get one of them, I will.

37:16.199 --> 37:17.777
He's a good kid, Robin.

37:17.909 --> 37:20.365
He hero-worships his brother,
but he's a good kid.

37:20.495 --> 37:24.327
Yeah?
Then his epithelials shouldn't be on that tie.

37:24.458 --> 37:26.450
You'd better check with your lab

37:26.585 --> 37:30.998
Explain how bits of your skin got on the ligature
used to strangle that victim.

37:32.549 --> 37:34.209
I don't know.

37:35.677 --> 37:38.347
Your brother brought this in
to the District Attorney.

37:42.392 --> 37:43.673
What?

37:43.810 --> 37:45.305
He's framing you.

37:45.437 --> 37:47.809
Unless you can tell us

37:47.940 --> 37:49.849
how your epithelials

37:49.983 --> 37:52.439
- got on that tie
- I don't know.

37:54.696 --> 37:59.026
I swear, I don't know. I...
I just picked up the bodies at his place.

38:00.744 --> 38:02.322
Grab that guy's tie, little bro.

38:02.454 --> 38:04.612
I like that thing

38:10.712 --> 38:12.456
You bury him deep, all right?

38:12.589 --> 38:14.048
If you get into any trouble,

38:14.174 --> 38:17.175
you don't have to say anything.
All right? I'm counting on you.

38:17.302 --> 38:20.054
Yeah. Yeah, man, I'm there all the way.

38:21.223 --> 38:23.215
Get outta here.

38:23.350 --> 38:25.343
Go on!

38:26.603 --> 38:28.181
I gotta ask you.

38:28.313 --> 38:31.729
How does somebody bury two bodies
as a favour?

38:31.858 --> 38:33.851
Cos he's my brother.

38:35.988 --> 38:40.032
He to... He told me that if I didn't talk...
to you guys,

38:40.158 --> 38:43.029
and if he didn't talk,
then this would all blow over, go away.

38:43.161 --> 38:47.029
You're looking at two counts of murder,
special circumstances.

38:47.165 --> 38:49.953
The best you can hope for is life without parole.

38:52.379 --> 38:55.131
I don't... I don't think I can do that kind of time.

38:57.884 --> 39:01.965
Do you have any physical evidence
linking your brother to the murders?

39:02.097 --> 39:03.556
Anything?

39:17.571 --> 39:18.685
(Gavel knock s)

39:20.657 --> 39:23.528
(Gavel knock s)
Guilty on all counts

39:23.660 --> 39:26.994
Guilty on all counts

39:58.904 --> 40:01.691
I know that we've arrested the wrong brother.

40:09.289 --> 40:11.531
He came to see you
as soon as Ben was in custody.

40:14.670 --> 40:15.998
I tried to help,

40:16.129 --> 40:18.455
without breaking my vows.

40:18.590 --> 40:20.583
(Chuckles)

40:21.718 --> 40:26.345
(Sighs) We both have jobs that begin
after the crime.

40:26.473 --> 40:28.466
After the sin.

40:28.600 --> 40:31.435
Some people would call that a career in futility

40:32.938 --> 40:35.808
Some call it a vocation.

40:38.652 --> 40:40.645
A hundred years ago,

40:40.779 --> 40:43.531
we didn't have the technology for fingerprints.

40:43.657 --> 40:46.492
Fifteen years ago, we didn't have DNA.

40:46.618 --> 40:48.611
Hopefully one day,

40:48.745 --> 40:54.084
we'll have foolproof means by which
to put the right man in jail in this case.

40:54.167 --> 40:56.837
Someday we won't need jails.

40:59.798 --> 41:04.175
I celebrate Mass every Thursday night, T o'clock.

41:06.597 --> 41:08.589
Thank you,

41:08.724 --> 41:10.716
but...

41:12.227 --> 41:14.350
...no.

41:14.479 --> 41:16.935
You don't believe?

41:17.065 --> 41:19.058
In religion.

41:19.192 --> 41:21.185
I believe in God,

41:21.320 --> 41:22.600
in science,

41:22.738 --> 41:25.229
in Sunday supper.

41:25.365 --> 41:28.699
I don't believe in rules that tell me
how I should live.

41:28.827 --> 41:31.614
Even if they're handed down by God?

41:31.747 --> 41:35.080
How many crusades were fought
in the name of God? How many people died

41:35.208 --> 41:38.375
because of... someone's religion?

41:38.503 --> 41:41.208
Fanaticism, not religion.

41:41.340 --> 41:42.798
Semantics.

41:42.925 --> 41:45.594
They're still dead.

41:46.762 --> 41:48.754
I'm sorry about Ben, Father.

41:52.392 --> 41:55.559
You still suffer like a Catholic.

41:57.689 --> 41:59.682
Light bulb goes out,

41:59.816 --> 42:02.189
other people fix it, get a new one.

42:02.319 --> 42:05.403
Light bulb goes out for the Catholic,

42:05.530 --> 42:09.860
he stands in the dark, says,
"What did I do wrong?"

42:12.663 --> 42:14.323
That guilt's not in me any more.

42:29.721 --> 42:32.295
- Hey.
- Oh.

42:32.432 --> 42:37.260
You're gonna be getting a call
from the local papers about spa safety.

42:38.397 --> 42:40.389
Spa safety?

42:40.524 --> 42:44.272
We had a victim die of an allergic reaction
at the Mediterranean.

42:44.403 --> 42:46.395
Some foul play, some negligence.

42:48.740 --> 42:52.074
- So, what am I supposed to say?
- That it was an isolated incident.

42:52.202 --> 42:55.867
That in no way should it be a mark against
the Strip's other fine hotel

42:55.998 --> 42:57.492
casinos.

42:57.624 --> 42:59.617
CSI supports Las Vegas.

42:59.751 --> 43:01.744
Bottom line.

43:05.966 --> 43:07.626
Go! In here!

43:07.759 --> 43:09.302
Get his arm!

43:09.428 --> 43:10.886
We need help in here!

43:16.810 --> 43:18.553
Hold his hand!

43:18.687 --> 43:21.854
- I can't stop it! Put some pressure on!
- No, no, no!

43:21.982 --> 43:25.018
- How did this happen?
- Incisor. He used his teeth.

43:25.152 --> 43:27.144
Put him down. It's not stopping!

43:28.113 --> 43:30.319
- Get out of the way!
- Keep him with us!

43:30.449 --> 43:32.157
Sir, step back!

43:32.284 --> 43:33.992
Sir!

43:35.495 --> 43:36.906
- Stop this!
- Pressure!

43:39.041 --> 43:40.369
Head up.

43:48.675 --> 43:50.383
I'm gonna pronounce

43:53.305 --> 43:59.208
