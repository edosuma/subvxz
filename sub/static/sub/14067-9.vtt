00:16.030 --> 00:19.256
Ooh! Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't see you there.

00:19.296 --> 00:20.504
How may I help you?

00:20.544 --> 00:23.520
Uh, I'm looking for, uh, Carl Sack.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.764
–I'm Carl Sack.
–You're Carl Sack?

00:26.100 --> 00:27.637
At your service. Full service.

00:27.677 --> 00:30.266
Um, I've seen photographs
of Mr Sack and—

00:30.306 --> 00:33.012
I look shorter in
person, and fatter and…

00:33.942 --> 00:35.478
Hello, Denny.
–I'm Carl Sack.

00:35.518 --> 00:38.007
He's got the mad cow.
It makes him think he's Carl…
–I'm Jenny Pratt.

00:38.047 --> 00:40.093
Yes. Um, let's go to my office.

00:40.848 --> 00:41.178
Okay.

00:49.692 --> 00:53.425
There were a dozen eyewitnesses,
and they all tell the same story.

00:53.465 --> 00:56.368
Dwayne Willis was brought
in a little before 9:00 p.m.

00:56.408 --> 00:58.103
They strapped him down on the table

00:58.143 --> 01:01.937
and hooked up the two
I.Vs, one in each arm.

01:02.140 --> 01:06.562
The first drug is supposed to render
the condemned man unconscious.

01:06.943 --> 01:07.603
It didn't.

01:08.445 --> 01:10.029
It was now 10 past 9:00.

01:10.683 --> 01:13.879
The drugs had been going into
him for nearly ten minutes.

01:13.919 --> 01:17.153
That's when officer Holt started
getting worried.

01:17.588 --> 01:18.776
More time goes by.

01:18.925 --> 01:22.687
Willis has been hooked up to
the drip for 20 minutes now.

01:23.094 --> 01:23.764
He's still conscious.

01:23.804 --> 01:25.963
An argument breaks out.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.700
The tech wants to pull the
I.Vs out and try again.

01:29.861 --> 01:33.029
Another guard says no,
just increase the dosage.

01:38.056 --> 01:41.617
And then Willis starts thrashing around.

01:42.418 --> 01:45.657
His chest is heaving.
He is gasping, choking. It's horrifying.

01:45.697 --> 01:48.190
And Holt says, “do something”…

01:48.694 --> 01:51.260
But nobody knows what to do.

01:51.330 --> 01:54.366
Willis has been hooked
up for a half-hour now.

01:54.965 --> 01:56.681
He's not even unconscious.

01:57.002 --> 01:58.935
He's gagging and thrashing,

01:59.405 --> 02:01.671
and that's when Holt just snapped.

02:04.219 --> 02:06.661
He fired one round into Willis' head.

02:10.691 --> 02:12.143
Willis died instantly.

02:14.363 --> 02:15.460
He's charged with murder two,

02:15.500 --> 02:18.496
but the D.A. is willing to
knock it down to manslaughter,

02:18.536 --> 02:21.098
only Holt won't take the deal.
–Ms Pratt…

02:21.138 --> 02:23.675
–Jenny.
–There must be many lawyers in Virginia

02:23.715 --> 02:26.645
who could do this.
–Yeah, I need an advocate
who can speak forcefully

02:26.685 --> 02:28.714
against the death penalty itself.

02:28.754 --> 02:32.043
Jenny, whatever one's feelings
are on the death penalty…

02:32.083 --> 02:34.216
–For it.
–…it's moot here.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.492
Your client… carried
out a death sentence,

02:38.155 --> 02:42.379
albeit in a unique fashion.
–But the legal issue is also unique.

02:42.760 --> 02:43.630
I mean, is it even possible

02:43.670 --> 02:46.893
to murder a man who's being executed?
–Double homicide. Happens all the time.

02:46.933 --> 02:50.563
A double homicide is when
two people are killed, Denny.

02:50.702 --> 02:51.890
What's your point?

02:52.237 --> 02:53.887
Listen, Jenny, I'm not s—

02:54.440 --> 02:55.710
Carl, Virginia is a swing state,

02:55.750 --> 02:57.972
and I've always wanted to swing.
–Denny.

02:58.012 --> 03:00.882
Carl, we need to bond. Hell,
man, this is our last season.

03:00.922 --> 03:03.694
If there's one thing
I've learned in life,

03:05.084 --> 03:07.658
it's never, ever say no to a road trip.

03:10.424 --> 03:25.759
Boston Legal 5×09
Kill, Baby, Kill
QA, sync improvements: ΤΖΩΤΖΙΟΥ

04:02.322 --> 04:05.028
I just couldn't watch
him suffer anymore.

04:05.451 --> 04:08.321
If I had to do it over
again, I'd do the same thing.

04:08.361 --> 04:10.921
–You only fired the one shot?
–Yes.

04:11.057 --> 04:14.895
We could go with defense of others,
but since you went into the room

04:14.935 --> 04:18.630
to participate in executing
the man, I don't think that—

04:18.863 --> 04:20.844
I didn't go in to torture him.

04:21.399 --> 04:24.739
Mm. Another approach, uh, would be
a version of diminished capacity.

04:24.779 --> 04:27.947
You were overcome with compassion…
–In Virginia?

04:28.643 --> 04:31.613
Moreover, your years
of witnessing executions

04:32.078 --> 04:34.124
could have taken a mental toll.

04:34.914 --> 04:36.300
I'm not arguing that.

04:37.585 --> 04:39.813
Um, how about… Simple
temporary insanity?

04:39.853 --> 04:42.290
You saw a man suffering.
You snapped. You w—

04:42.330 --> 04:45.696
No, I knew exactly what
I did while I was doing it.

04:45.790 --> 04:46.846
I'd do it again.

04:50.062 --> 04:52.438
We don't have a lot to go with here.

04:52.478 --> 04:54.128
I won't say I was insane.

05:13.183 --> 05:14.653
You want us to just cut him loose?

05:14.693 --> 05:16.655
You make it sound as if
he's strung up somewhere.

05:16.695 --> 05:19.425
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
–Mr Sack, uh, you're a stranger here.

05:19.465 --> 05:21.987
I knew it. They plan to
play the stranger card.

05:22.027 --> 05:24.271
Aren't we all brothers, my friend?

05:26.063 --> 05:28.967
–This is a very serious matter.
–Yes, it is.

05:29.269 --> 05:32.165
So I thought perhaps we
could be serious for a second.

05:32.205 --> 05:35.835
You don't mean to tell a
jury of your fellow Virginians

05:36.741 --> 05:37.704
that shooting a man

05:37.744 --> 05:40.474
the Commonwealth was in
the process of killing

05:40.514 --> 05:43.284
was murder or manslaughter
or in fact any crime at all?

05:43.324 --> 05:46.313
–It was a crime, according to the law.
–Understood,

05:46.353 --> 05:49.090
but a D.A. has discretion
whether to charge, do they not?

05:49.130 --> 05:50.984
–Good ones do.
–Well, he looks good.

05:51.024 --> 05:53.094
–He looks great.
–Best I've seen.
–Me, too.

05:53.134 --> 05:56.394
Look… I am not
dismissing the charges.

05:56.404 --> 05:59.762
He is going on trial for murder.
–You're not my brother anymore,

05:59.802 --> 06:03.762
which I believe leaves me free
to have sex with your sister.

06:03.762 --> 06:05.762
We try to make our cases fun.

06:13.037 --> 06:16.667
–I can't thank you enough for seeing me, Alan.
–Please.

06:19.474 --> 06:23.105
So I hear you've become
quite the busy man these days, huh?

06:23.145 --> 06:24.212
Big lawyer.

06:25.448 --> 06:26.711
A celebrity of sorts?

06:26.751 --> 06:29.251
–Oh, well, no.
–Well, you look great.

06:29.261 --> 06:33.485
–Thank you.
–You know, I always figured you
to age fat and bald.

06:33.957 --> 06:35.053
Well, I was lucky enough

06:35.093 --> 06:37.667
to stave off the evil that so ages men.

06:38.762 --> 06:41.498
–Which is?
–Marriage.

06:42.419 --> 06:43.607
What's up, Martha?

06:45.511 --> 06:47.941
Well, unfortunately,
I was fired from my job.

06:47.981 --> 06:50.414
A very good job, I might add.

06:50.424 --> 06:52.979
I was district sales manager
for a software company,

06:53.019 --> 06:55.515
in line to become
regional sales manager.

06:55.555 --> 06:57.685
Now I know that this
may be hard to prove,

06:57.725 --> 07:00.955
but I think I got fired
because I voted for John McCain.

07:00.995 --> 07:04.592
My boss and I, we got into this
big fight over the election.

07:04.632 --> 07:11.670
And as soon as I told him who
I voted for, he just got this look
of disgust on his face, as…

07:11.680 --> 07:16.234
Not entirely dissimilar to the expression
on your face at the moment.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.690
But anyway, uh, so he fired me.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.960
Did he, uh, give you a reason?

07:21.016 --> 07:23.645
No. No, they don't have
to give a reason anymore.

07:23.685 --> 07:25.947
They're advised by their
labor lawyers not to.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.957
But I know it was because
I voted for McCain.

07:28.971 --> 07:31.083
I can feel it in my bones, Alan.

07:32.676 --> 07:34.797
And the prisoner started
gasping for breath

07:34.837 --> 07:36.532
and moving around on the table.

07:36.572 --> 07:38.408
–Is that uncommon?
–It's happened before.

07:38.448 --> 07:42.643
No two lethal injections ever seem
to go exactly the same way.

07:42.845 --> 07:44.874
There was a lot of
screaming and yelling.

07:44.914 --> 07:47.281
Officer Holt became very… upset.

07:48.284 --> 07:52.391
Then he suddenly pulled out his gun
and shot the prisoner in the head.

07:52.431 --> 07:55.665
Are you familiar with the
case Emmett v. Johnson?

07:56.659 --> 07:57.196
I've heard of it.

07:57.236 --> 08:00.800
Something like lethal
injection is cruel and barbaric.

08:00.897 --> 08:03.336
Something like.
According to briefs filed in that case,

08:03.376 --> 08:06.298
Virginia's method in particular
carries a greater risk

08:06.338 --> 08:08.841
of inflicting pain than
the method used in Kentucky,

08:08.881 --> 08:12.079
which the supreme court approved.
–Our methods are substantially the same.

08:12.119 --> 08:16.140
The briefing includes evidence
that members of the death team,

08:16.180 --> 08:18.811
including, I assume, you,
don't understand how the drugs work,

08:18.851 --> 08:20.954
don't know how to
properly administer an I.V.

08:20.994 --> 08:23.581
and don't know how to
correctly observe the inmate

08:23.621 --> 08:27.528
during the execution to determine
if anything is going wrong.

08:27.568 --> 08:29.730
That's… That's an
argument in a lawsuit.

08:29.770 --> 08:33.558
There's another argument on the
other side. Why don't you read that?

08:33.599 --> 08:36.772
Oh, I'm sure there is. Are you aware
that a prominent medical society

08:36.812 --> 08:39.299
has found Virginia's method of
execution unacceptable?

08:39.340 --> 08:42.010
I know doctors have an
issue with the death penalty

08:42.049 --> 08:47.000
in general, so it wouldn't surprise me
if some physicians' group said that.

08:47.008 --> 08:50.048
Neither would I, except the group
I'm referring to happens to be

08:50.088 --> 08:52.992
the American veterinary
medical association.

08:53.083 --> 08:56.359
Some vets have banned your
lethal injection protocol

08:56.399 --> 08:58.328
because the method
Virginia uses on humans

08:58.368 --> 09:02.203
is considered too barbaric to be
used on cats and dogs.
–Objection.

09:02.243 --> 09:05.871
The A.V.M.A. has said that
their report was misinterpreted.

09:05.911 --> 09:06.571
Sustained.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.886
Mr Sack, this case is not about
the legitimacy of the death penalty.

09:10.926 --> 09:12.980
And if that's where you're coming from,

09:13.020 --> 09:17.385
you can tuck in your little tail
and head on back to Massachusetts.

09:17.425 --> 09:19.854
Your honor, I'm very
proud of my home state…

09:19.894 --> 09:21.864
Home of the Red Sox, the Patriots, Mitt.

09:21.904 --> 09:25.194
–We take our laws here in Virginia
very seriously, sir.
–Do you take this case seriously?

09:25.234 --> 09:27.837
Show of hands. Because,
you know, it is a bit silly.

09:27.877 --> 09:31.767
–Objection.
–There's a man on trial here
for trying to kill somebody

09:31.807 --> 09:32.777
the state was already killing.

09:32.817 --> 09:35.145
If anything, my client
accomplished the death penalty.

09:35.185 --> 09:38.116
–Mr Sack…
–…the legitimacy of which I certainly
would never question,

09:38.156 --> 09:40.084
particularly in Virginia.
–Your honor!

09:40.124 --> 09:43.017
Oh, how about torture?
Are we for that?

09:43.027 --> 09:45.357
–I'm warning you.
–Because this man was being tortured,

09:45.397 --> 09:47.258
that's why my client pulled the trigger…
–Objection, your honor!

09:47.298 --> 09:48.927
–Order. Order! Order!
–Objection!

09:48.967 --> 09:51.159
To spare horrendous suffering!

09:51.461 --> 09:54.167
Get control of the
room, will you, judge?

09:55.109 --> 09:55.637
Bailiff.

10:14.538 --> 10:15.967
Blanks. What's his problem?

10:16.007 --> 10:18.911
How'd you even get the gun
in the courtroom?

10:19.776 --> 10:20.502
Oh, please.

10:20.545 --> 10:24.680
–Denny… What are you doing?
–Will you relax?

10:25.084 --> 10:27.311
Like I said, firstly, it was blanks,

10:27.351 --> 10:29.082
secondly… this is Virginia.

10:29.122 --> 10:33.420
My approval rating went up in that room.
I'm a hero to those people.

10:33.460 --> 10:37.486
I couldn't be more popular if
I got kids to smoke cigarettes.

10:37.496 --> 10:41.432
Carl, don't leave me here.
I can't swing in here.

10:42.413 --> 10:43.733
Alan's way more fun.

10:52.715 --> 10:56.345
–I appreciate you making the time to see me.
–Oh, sure.

10:56.346 --> 11:00.819
Well, actually, my lawyer
told me not to see you,
but I never listen to him anyway.

11:00.859 --> 11:05.677
No, you certainly didn't bother to consult
with him before firing Martha.

11:05.689 --> 11:08.725
–Nice try.
–Why did you fire her, Mr Feldcamp?

11:09.026 --> 11:10.478
It wasn't working out.

11:10.624 --> 11:13.822
–How so?
–Oh, hard to say. You know, as an employer,

11:13.862 --> 11:15.766
you sometimes get a
feel for an employee,

11:15.806 --> 11:17.301
and with Martha… Hard worker,

11:17.341 --> 11:19.771
but she was never gonna
make the next step,

11:19.811 --> 11:22.707
and in this company, you
either move up or you move out.

11:22.747 --> 11:25.717
Martha's of the impression
that you fired her

11:25.909 --> 11:29.209
because she voted for John
McCain in the election.

11:29.846 --> 11:33.278
She's mistaken. Look, I
voted for McCain, all right?

11:33.584 --> 11:35.762
Martha simply wasn't working out.

11:36.386 --> 11:40.722
There must be a reason
you didn't think she was working out.

11:42.428 --> 11:45.498
If I have to depose you to
force an answer, I can do so,

11:45.538 --> 11:48.046
but you seem to be
rather forthcoming.

11:48.156 --> 11:50.268
Why not just tell me now?
–Okay.

11:54.785 --> 11:55.581
She's stupid.

11:55.621 --> 11:58.063
And as for evidence of her stupidity?

11:59.391 --> 12:01.173
Oh, God, I could cite many.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.938
–Cite one.
–She voted for Mccain.

12:04.196 --> 12:05.978
You said you voted for him.

12:06.598 --> 12:07.235
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I did.

12:07.275 --> 12:10.930
I voted for him because I like
his policies on nuclear energy,

12:10.970 --> 12:12.099
because I believed he'd make

12:12.139 --> 12:14.901
a better commander in
chief in times of war,

12:14.941 --> 12:17.119
because I trusted his experience.

12:17.743 --> 12:20.909
But Martha voted for Mccain because
she found Sarah Palin to be… spunky.

12:20.949 --> 12:24.645
So you admit you fired her
because of who she voted for.

12:24.919 --> 12:27.149
No, I fired her because she is stupid.

12:27.189 --> 12:29.459
Look, I got a bad feeling
about her, you know?

12:29.499 --> 12:32.829
It's plain and simple.
–I'm starting to get a bad feeling about you.

12:32.869 --> 12:36.367
Well, then it's lucky for
me that you're not my boss.

12:37.098 --> 12:40.398
Look, are we done?
–No, I'm afraid we're not done.

12:41.203 --> 12:43.711
Rather, it seems we're just beginning.

12:43.839 --> 12:46.677
Look, Mr Shore, I fire
people all the time,

12:46.775 --> 12:48.953
and some of them go on to sue me.

12:49.077 --> 12:52.255
This is an at-will employment here.
It's my will.

12:52.295 --> 12:55.463
So if you want to file a lawsuit,
join the club.

12:56.102 --> 12:58.472
Oh, I'm not a member of
any club, I assure you.

12:58.512 --> 13:00.756
I tend to stick out. I don't mind.

13:01.506 --> 13:05.238
It makes me more memorable.
You'll remember me, Mr Feldcamp.

13:05.278 --> 13:08.710
Mm. Yeah, don't let the
door hit you on the way out.

13:14.388 --> 13:17.754
First is sodium thiopental,
which is a barbiturate.

13:18.424 --> 13:19.853
Next comes pancuronium bromide,

13:19.893 --> 13:22.688
a muscle relaxant that
paralyzes the diaphragm

13:22.728 --> 13:23.524
and thus stops breathing.

13:23.564 --> 13:25.534
Then potassium chloride is injected,

13:25.574 --> 13:29.264
and that stops the heart.
–But that's not what happened here.

13:29.304 --> 13:31.174
–Not exactly.
–What did happen?

13:31.214 --> 13:34.169
Well, the technician who
started the I.V. on the prisoner

13:34.209 --> 13:36.812
missed the vein in one
arm, and in the other arm,

13:36.852 --> 13:38.782
he stuck the needle
through the prisoner's vein

13:38.822 --> 13:41.852
and into his muscle tissue.
–Do you know of other botched executions

13:41.892 --> 13:46.446
using the lethal injection method?
–There have been too many to list.

13:46.523 --> 13:49.260
This is something that
should be done by doctors,

13:49.300 --> 13:51.855
but doctors refuse to do it on ethical grounds.
–But, I mean, to be fair,

13:51.895 --> 13:54.098
in most instances where
lethal injection is used,

13:54.138 --> 13:58.626
the condemned man just sort of
drifts off to sleep without incident.

13:58.806 --> 14:00.876
It's more likely that
the paralytic agent

14:00.916 --> 14:03.886
simply prevents prisoners
from communicating.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.473
In fact, they could be suffocating,

14:05.513 --> 14:08.747
suffering excruciating
pain during the procedure.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.786
They're just unable to scream.

14:10.826 --> 14:13.748
How many of these
so-called botched executions

14:13.788 --> 14:15.570
occurred in Virginia?
–One.

14:15.725 --> 14:18.195
And the supreme court
has approved the method

14:18.235 --> 14:21.456
of lethal injection used in
the Commonwealth of Virginia?

14:21.496 --> 14:25.963
–And we know they're such sticklers.
–Mr Sack, I will hold you in contempt.

14:26.003 --> 14:28.873
And the supreme court has
not approved prison guards

14:28.913 --> 14:32.011
shooting condemned prisoners
in the head, have they?
–Has anybody asked them?

14:32.051 --> 14:36.473
Now look, we all know things went
wrong here. That's not the point.

14:36.512 --> 14:38.888
I will repeat, the question here is,

14:39.049 --> 14:40.819
do we simply give
prison guards the right

14:40.859 --> 14:43.697
to just whip out their
guns and blast away?

14:43.854 --> 14:50.464
Well, thank you, your honor,
for framing the issue
in such a neutral and impartial way.

15:00.672 --> 15:03.972
–Why do you need my help?
–Well, I don't probably.

15:04.243 --> 15:08.645
It's just Denny's out of town and…
–Will you give up, ever?

15:09.647 --> 15:12.711
I have no one to share private
thoughts with tonight on the balcony.

15:12.751 --> 15:14.551
Shirley, this man Feldcamp…

15:15.988 --> 15:17.984
The unfettered, smug arrogance…

15:18.024 --> 15:21.126
He could almost make
Rudy Giuliani seem humble.

15:21.327 --> 15:22.779
Come on. It'll be fun.

15:23.030 --> 15:25.426
He really fired her
because of how she voted?

15:25.466 --> 15:29.802
Well, he's claiming it's stupidity,
but yes, I think he did.

15:29.804 --> 15:35.508
–And what exactly would my role be?
–Why do you say it with such distrust?

15:35.977 --> 15:38.551
Because I can smell a dog on the sniff.

15:39.146 --> 15:43.172
Don't be ridiculous. You're almost
old enough to be my mother

15:43.551 --> 15:45.531
or one of my mother's friends…

15:45.555 --> 15:48.657
The one who used to
sunbathe naked by the pool.

15:49.826 --> 15:52.532
So you want to march
into court tomorrow,

15:52.796 --> 15:56.360
the two of us side by side,
and fight for a woman who…

15:56.665 --> 15:58.381
Who voted for John McCain.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.480
He all but admitted to me, your honor,

16:11.783 --> 16:15.080
that he fired her because
she voted for John McCain.

16:15.120 --> 16:18.283
He made no such admission.
The basis was her stupidity.

16:18.323 --> 16:21.161
Yes, and the evidence
of that was her vote.

16:21.259 --> 16:25.590
Look, they got into a big political
debate three days before—
–During which, the plaintiff

16:25.630 --> 16:27.734
further displayed a
complete lack of intellect,

16:27.774 --> 16:29.736
which prompted my client—
–Because she didn't share

16:29.776 --> 16:33.164
your client's political point of view.
–My client voted for Mccain.

16:33.204 --> 16:37.935
Your honor, my client is a republican
who was happy with Ms Headly's vote,

16:37.975 --> 16:41.282
but nonetheless, could not ignore
that she was… Well, dumb.

16:41.322 --> 16:43.214
–How dare you?
–Ms Headly.

16:43.224 --> 16:46.326
–He just called me dumb and stupid.
–Ms Headly.

16:47.454 --> 16:49.850
Mr Davidson, as I read the affidavit,

16:49.890 --> 16:52.927
it does seem like she was fired
for her political opinions.

16:52.967 --> 16:55.871
Free speech is not a
right in the workplace.

16:55.873 --> 16:58.145
People are hired for their opinions
and perceived intellect.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.781
That's why we have interviews,
to determine whether we like

17:00.821 --> 17:04.810
what comes out of their mouths.
–Listen, the fact is, this woman did get hired,

17:04.849 --> 17:09.008
and then she was discharged
for exactly as you say, your honor,

17:09.011 --> 17:09.772
her political opinion.

17:09.813 --> 17:12.776
All right, I want to hear
Ms Headly on the stand,

17:12.816 --> 17:15.852
and I want to hear
exactly how this went down.

17:16.285 --> 17:16.878
Let's go.

17:20.055 --> 17:21.045
It seemed like…

17:22.224 --> 17:23.479
I don't know, like…

17:24.262 --> 17:27.430
Like it had gone past
the point of torture even.

17:27.999 --> 17:30.903
I just… I couldn't
watch him suffer anymore.

17:31.667 --> 17:32.261
So I, um…

17:34.038 --> 17:35.028
I took him out.

17:35.606 --> 17:36.476
Did you stop to think, sir,

17:36.516 --> 17:39.805
that you were breaking the law by—
–No, no, no, no, no.

17:39.845 --> 17:42.419
All I could see was
a person suffering,

17:43.515 --> 17:45.429
just way beyond the point of…

17:46.885 --> 17:47.941
It was inhumane.

17:49.455 --> 17:51.369
Somebody had to do something.

17:51.792 --> 17:55.356
I yelled at the others, but
they just stood there, so…

17:56.095 --> 17:57.057
It just wasn't right.

17:57.097 --> 18:00.331
You decided all by yourself
to take a human life.

18:00.333 --> 18:02.130
No, the… the man
was dying anyway,

18:02.170 --> 18:04.942
I made the decision
to be humane about it.

18:06.272 --> 18:09.145
I see. I've prosecuted two doctors
who made the same decision.

18:09.185 --> 18:15.048
They had terminal patients in agony,
so they decided to hasten their deaths.

18:16.720 --> 18:20.482
In fact, I believe your family
faced a similar situation.

18:22.592 --> 18:26.552
You had an aunt who was dying
of ovarian cancer. Am I right?

18:26.994 --> 18:29.701
–Yes.
–And there were those in your family

18:29.741 --> 18:32.381
who wanted to put her on a morphine drip

18:33.103 --> 18:36.271
to speed things up because
she was suffering so.

18:36.437 --> 18:38.440
Is that true?
–Yes.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.486
What was your position
there? Do you remember?

18:42.845 --> 18:46.673
–I was against it.
–You thought it was murder, didn't you?

18:46.852 --> 18:49.228
You told your mother and the doctor,

18:51.824 --> 18:54.224
“only God gets to make that call.”

18:54.853 --> 18:58.615
Do you now amend that to “God
and correctional officers”?

19:08.066 --> 19:11.300
We got into this huge
argument on nuclear energy.

19:11.469 --> 19:16.155
I'm against it, and he's for it.
Now that argument somehow got replaced

19:16.700 --> 19:20.726
by some brouhaha on the war.
I'm against it, and he's for it.

19:21.872 --> 19:22.742
And that segued into taxes,

19:22.782 --> 19:25.245
and he doesn't think
he should have to pay any,

19:25.285 --> 19:29.873
and I said to him that if he—
–So you had a lot of political differences?

19:29.913 --> 19:30.507
Yes. Yes.

19:31.582 --> 19:33.496
Well, then the very next day,

19:33.820 --> 19:36.922
after I did inform him
that I voted for Mccain,

19:37.421 --> 19:38.651
he called me a complete idiot.

19:38.691 --> 19:41.067
Uh, Mr Feldcamp called you an idiot?

19:41.683 --> 19:43.453
–A complete one.
–And then what happened?

19:43.493 --> 19:46.746
Well, not long after that,
he walked into my office

19:46.786 --> 19:47.842
and he fired me.

19:48.390 --> 19:50.127
Have you ever had
any yearly reviews

19:50.167 --> 19:53.401
with respect to your
employment with Mr Feldcamp?

19:53.793 --> 19:54.057
Yes.

19:55.329 --> 19:56.253
How'd they go?

19:56.933 --> 20:01.365
Okay. He said I could perform better
and he said sales could be higher.

20:01.405 --> 20:03.808
But in this economy?
Come on. You know that.

20:03.848 --> 20:05.610
It's bad everywhere. I mean, it's, like,

20:05.650 --> 20:08.238
the number one problem
in this country right now.

20:08.278 --> 20:11.015
So you consider the economy
to be the number one problem

20:11.055 --> 20:13.048
in the country?
–Yes, I do.

20:14.718 --> 20:23.660
Mm. If I may ask, how does John McCain's
economic policy differ from Barack Obama's?

20:25.228 --> 20:25.624
Taxes…

20:28.398 --> 20:28.926
And, um…

20:32.336 --> 20:35.593
Well I'm not exactly sure
what else, to be honest.

20:35.633 --> 20:38.471
Well, if you consider it to be
the number one problem in the country…

20:38.511 --> 20:41.508
Look, even despite how they
all say they'll be different,

20:41.548 --> 20:44.228
they all do the same thing once
they get elected. You know that.

20:44.268 --> 20:47.627
You were an ardent
Hillary Clinton supporter,

20:48.331 --> 20:50.268
were you not?
–Yes, I was, proudly.

20:50.308 --> 20:53.237
And according to your coworkers,
you crossed over to Mccain

20:53.277 --> 20:55.399
primarily because of Sarah Palin.
–Yes.

20:55.439 --> 20:58.202
Because her policies were
consistent with Hillary's?

20:58.242 --> 21:00.642
Because I was impressed with her.

21:00.652 --> 21:02.773
And because she strikes
me as a real American,

21:02.813 --> 21:04.991
which is what this country needs.

21:04.996 --> 21:06.580
And you liked her spunk.

21:06.699 --> 21:09.207
And the country needs spunk, too, yes.

21:17.975 --> 21:19.427
Another Saturday night

21:20.348 --> 21:23.450
I don't have a good
feeling on this one, Denny.

21:23.951 --> 21:26.129
Virginia is not being nice to me.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.767
A little constructive criticism?

21:32.059 --> 21:33.095
–Okay.
–You're not very good.

21:33.135 --> 21:35.445
Thanks for keeping it constructive.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.701
Well, you're making this
a referendum on the death penalty.

21:38.741 --> 21:41.529
You gotta get it through that
liberal, democrat skull…

21:41.569 --> 21:43.747
Americans love the death penalty.

21:44.471 --> 21:47.040
–We do?
–Yeah, especially these parts.

21:47.143 --> 21:50.113
Hillary and Obama, you
know those pinko-heads

21:51.079 --> 21:54.911
couldn't really be pro-death penalty,
but they claim they are…

21:54.951 --> 21:57.847
and in fact, almost everyone
who runs for president

21:57.887 --> 22:00.395
miraculously is for the death penalty.

22:01.457 --> 22:05.760
Why? 'Cause this is the U.S. of A.
Death penalty rules.

22:05.963 --> 22:09.329
Flip the switch, ready,
aim, fire, turn up the gas…

22:09.799 --> 22:11.647
It's who we are as a people.

22:12.268 --> 22:14.764
Hell, you… you heard it at
the Republican convention.

22:14.804 --> 22:15.926
Kill, baby, kill.

22:16.773 --> 22:18.225
It's our mantra, Carl.

22:18.309 --> 22:20.685
I thought republicans were pro-life.

22:21.546 --> 22:23.988
That's for babies. Criminals we kill.

22:24.349 --> 22:26.646
You're going about this ass backwards.

22:26.686 --> 22:29.986
The argument you want to
make to the jury is this…

22:31.188 --> 22:32.838
That, uh, uh, Willis guy,

22:33.092 --> 22:35.930
he wasn't dying the
way he was supposed to.

22:35.960 --> 22:40.057
After receiving the injection,
the bastard refused to choke out.

22:40.097 --> 22:41.559
So our client finished him off.

22:41.599 --> 22:44.669
Job done, game over, bang.

22:46.004 --> 22:47.852
Preston Holt, American hero.

22:48.306 --> 22:49.428
Kill, baby, kill.

22:51.110 --> 22:53.618
♫ Some good ole boys having some fun ♫

22:58.517 --> 22:58.781
Ahh.

22:59.652 --> 23:00.510
Do you think…

23:01.104 --> 23:04.792
Martha and Sarah and Joe the…

23:04.832 --> 23:06.777
Is he an electrician?

23:07.394 --> 23:08.714
Plumber, unlicensed.

23:09.163 --> 23:11.341
Are… are they the real Americans?

23:11.992 --> 23:12.944
Not necessarily.

23:12.984 --> 23:16.020
I think that's what
this election just proved,

23:16.055 --> 23:19.223
that real Americans aren't
just rural and white.

23:20.324 --> 23:24.614
The portrait of real Americans
has been redrawn in this election.

23:25.365 --> 23:28.731
Real Americans are of all
ages, races, ethnicities.

23:29.068 --> 23:33.838
They live in cities and apartments
as well as… farms.

23:35.374 --> 23:37.222
I… We have a president-elect

23:37.920 --> 23:45.894
who fits into no category or demographic
whatsoever other than he's an American.

23:48.897 --> 23:50.415
God, I wept that night.

23:53.376 --> 23:54.009
Did you?

23:55.608 --> 24:03.481
No, I just… watched and watched and…
Didn't want the night to end.

24:09.144 --> 24:13.064
I already miss Sarah Palin, though.
She was fun while she lasted.

24:13.104 --> 24:15.612
I hope they let her keep the wardrobe.

24:17.908 --> 24:19.690
I still have to say though,

24:20.546 --> 24:23.978
as heartened as I am by the
election and by America…

24:26.672 --> 24:27.002
What?

24:28.457 --> 24:33.493
–Martha's a little bit of an idiot.
–Shirley, almost 47% of this country

24:33.744 --> 24:34.473
didn't vote for Obama,

24:34.513 --> 24:38.077
perhaps because they disagreed
with him on the issues,

24:38.716 --> 24:39.640
which is fine.

24:40.460 --> 24:44.024
But some, no doubt, because
they thought he was Muslim

24:44.129 --> 24:46.325
with terrorists on his speed dial,

24:46.365 --> 24:49.029
and others because
th-they were convinced

24:49.069 --> 24:52.032
he was not only socialist,
but even worse, a bad bowler,

24:52.072 --> 24:54.469
and others still
because they simply loved

24:54.509 --> 24:58.205
those cream-colored jackets
Sarah may have to give back.

24:59.414 --> 25:02.843
But there's one thing all
those idiots have in common.

25:02.883 --> 25:04.929
–What?
–They still get to vote.

25:15.928 --> 25:16.258
What?

25:18.888 --> 25:19.284
Sorry.

25:21.726 --> 25:24.894
Just looking at you under
a gently lit sky with…

25:25.230 --> 25:30.504
Sharing the same oral
fixation Denny and I…

25:31.468 --> 25:33.132
Is it a little game, Alan,

25:33.172 --> 25:38.400
or… or are you really
sexually attracted to me?

25:39.168 --> 25:41.256
I'm sexually attracted to you.

25:43.848 --> 25:44.772
I'm in my 60s.

25:45.117 --> 25:47.559
Well, first of all, you're beautiful.

25:49.056 --> 25:53.472
And second, your
intellect is… dazzling.

25:55.104 --> 25:58.927
And third, I've seen the naked
pictures of you. –Oh, right.

25:58.967 --> 26:01.673
Let's not discuss the
cheerleader outfit.

26:05.936 --> 26:06.464
So if I…

26:10.176 --> 26:12.816
If I wanted to go there,
you'd go there?

26:15.056 --> 26:15.848
In a second.

26:19.704 --> 26:23.070
Oh, if only Obama had picked
you as vice president…

26:23.880 --> 26:25.728
What a world we'd have then.

26:44.208 --> 26:47.424
Look… I can see the defendant's point.

26:47.524 --> 26:50.560
The man was dying anyway.
What's the big deal?

26:51.527 --> 26:51.857
Well…

26:52.897 --> 26:55.167
What about the doctor
or the hospice worker

26:55.207 --> 26:58.573
who wants to speed the
death of that cancer patient

26:58.868 --> 26:59.364
dying in agony?

26:59.404 --> 27:02.968
Or what about the nurses
who opt to withhold treatment

27:03.207 --> 27:04.811
from those severely retarded infants

27:04.851 --> 27:07.161
who only face a lifetime of misery?

27:09.113 --> 27:10.895
We don't go down that path.

27:10.983 --> 27:14.547
We don't start measuring
the quality of people's lives

27:14.920 --> 27:17.230
to decide whether or not they live.

27:18.158 --> 27:21.128
The defendant took the
law into his own hands

27:21.660 --> 27:22.956
and murdered somebody.

27:22.996 --> 27:25.174
Nobody gets the right to do that.

27:25.932 --> 27:28.242
Whether the person is on death row,

27:28.602 --> 27:31.242
whether a person has a day left to live,

27:31.968 --> 27:33.618
an hour or even a minute…

27:35.405 --> 27:37.517
You don't get to shoot somebody.

27:39.576 --> 27:40.944
That's the law.

27:42.864 --> 27:43.854
That's the law…

27:44.768 --> 27:47.738
Because of a presumed
sanctity of human life?

27:47.803 --> 27:50.245
That sanctity was off the table here.

27:51.384 --> 27:54.946
The life was being
executed by the state.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.184
Uh, forgive me, but you know
what I think is really going on

28:01.224 --> 28:03.052
is this man doesn't
like capital punishment,

28:03.092 --> 28:05.822
and he's trying to
bring scrutiny upon it.

28:05.862 --> 28:07.859
It's the only possible explanation.

28:07.899 --> 28:10.994
If he can get you to say
this execution was wrong,

28:11.034 --> 28:13.138
well, that's one step from saying,

28:13.178 --> 28:16.742
“gee, maybe executions are wrong.”
–That's ridiculous.

28:16.824 --> 28:19.208
More ridiculous than accusing
a man of murdering someone

28:19.248 --> 28:20.766
who was being executed?

28:20.928 --> 28:23.016
Let's not kid ourselves.
There are those out there

28:23.056 --> 28:25.185
trying to get rid of capital punishment.

28:25.225 --> 28:27.997
And I would suspect
they have to be tricky

28:28.152 --> 28:31.980
because they know we the people
are overwhelmingly for it.

28:31.988 --> 28:34.151
We the people know the death penalty

28:34.191 --> 28:36.831
is one of the things
that makes America…

28:38.093 --> 28:39.017
well, America.

28:39.628 --> 28:41.912
Not many countries have it, you know?

28:41.952 --> 28:43.837
We're… we're the only
westernized country left.

28:43.877 --> 28:47.256
And it's not easy being
in the company of Iraq,

28:47.472 --> 28:49.914
China, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Sudan.

28:52.152 --> 28:54.944
And I'll admit, the reasons for
abolishing capital punishment

28:54.984 --> 28:55.813
are compelling.

28:55.853 --> 28:58.116
It costs us hundreds
of millions of dollars,

28:58.156 --> 29:00.392
up to six times more
than life imprisonment.

29:00.432 --> 29:01.435
It doesn't seem to deter crime.

29:01.475 --> 29:05.263
Murder rates are actually lower
in non-death-penalty States.

29:05.303 --> 29:05.932
It's well-known.

29:05.972 --> 29:08.105
Canada's homicide rate fell 40%

29:08.174 --> 29:10.748
after they abolished the death penalty.

29:11.477 --> 29:13.800
We botch executions a lot.

29:13.800 --> 29:14.796
Medical evidence now shows

29:14.836 --> 29:17.674
that even when they
go off without a hitch,

29:18.120 --> 29:21.871
the executed suffer
perhaps excruciating pain.

29:21.911 --> 29:25.374
There are many reasons to do
away with capital punishment.

29:25.414 --> 29:27.790
But we don't because, let's face it,

29:28.951 --> 29:31.121
the death penalty? It's
who we are as a people.

29:31.161 --> 29:33.482
We're an eye-for-an-eye
kind of nation,

29:33.522 --> 29:36.030
and we don't have to apologize for it.

29:36.091 --> 29:38.335
Listen, if somebody killed my son…

29:39.095 --> 29:41.339
We believe in executing murderers.

29:42.288 --> 29:44.880
It's… Justice.

29:45.535 --> 29:47.713
The only thing my client did here

29:48.405 --> 29:50.108
was carry out the state's mission.

29:50.148 --> 29:52.788
It makes no sense to be prosecuting him.

29:53.579 --> 29:56.813
The only conceivable
explanation is that this man

29:57.450 --> 30:01.410
is insidiously trying to bring
scrutiny on the death penalty

30:01.728 --> 30:05.088
because he secretly… is against it.

30:17.656 --> 30:20.048
No, look, as I said to
her lawyer over there,

30:20.088 --> 30:22.388
I like Martha Headly. Nice lady.

30:22.523 --> 30:26.429
But my God, sales is about selling,
it's about relating to people.

30:26.469 --> 30:28.798
She doesn't even read the newspaper.
–Well, George Bush doesn't read the paper.

30:28.838 --> 30:31.460
I'd never hire George
Bush. Would anybody?

30:31.500 --> 30:33.944
And yet you voted for John
McCain, who supports—

30:33.984 --> 30:36.321
No, no, no, no, no. This
is not about politics.

30:36.361 --> 30:38.516
This is about being smart or not smart,

30:38.556 --> 30:41.059
and she is the latter.
–But, Mr Feldcamp, to be fair,

30:41.099 --> 30:44.729
you're basing your conclusion
on her political opinion.

30:44.760 --> 30:45.363
No, what I'm saying

30:45.403 --> 30:47.166
is that whatever your
opinion is about anything,

30:47.206 --> 30:50.794
at least be able to defend
it, and failing that, articulate it.

30:50.834 --> 30:53.166
Martha's never been
the brightest bulb in the tanning booth,

30:53.206 --> 30:56.109
but when she talks politics,
I, you know, I just cringe.

30:56.149 --> 30:58.912
I go, “how can I have a person
like that working for me?”

30:58.952 --> 31:00.981
Well, guess what. My
company. I don't have to.

31:01.021 --> 31:04.544
Do you make all your employees
defend their political beliefs?

31:04.584 --> 31:06.954
Not all my employees launch into them.

31:06.994 --> 31:10.808
But had she defended hers better, she might—
–Look, look, look, for 16 months,

31:10.848 --> 31:11.878
she just went prancing around

31:11.918 --> 31:13.352
talking Hillary,
Hillary, Hillary, Hillary,

31:13.392 --> 31:15.812
and then she railed
against Obama's inexperience

31:15.852 --> 31:17.516
all throughout the primaries,

31:17.556 --> 31:20.118
and then out comes some
moose hunter from Alaska.

31:20.158 --> 31:22.261
She knows nothing about Sarah Palin

31:22.301 --> 31:25.289
or about John Mccain. What
does that say about her?
–Sarah?

31:25.329 --> 31:26.253
–No.
–Hillary?

31:26.465 --> 31:28.688
Her! What does it say about a person

31:28.728 --> 31:31.094
who can be so arbitrary, so fickle?

31:31.104 --> 31:33.367
And this is about stuff she
actually felt strongly about.

31:33.407 --> 31:35.628
I'll tell you what it
says. She is an idiot.

31:35.668 --> 31:37.862
You know, let somebody else hire her.

31:37.902 --> 31:39.684
I don't think it'll be you.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.467
How dare you let him go off on me

31:42.507 --> 31:43.310
like that in a courtroom.

31:43.350 --> 31:46.224
–I didn't let him go off.
–Yes, you did.

31:46.224 --> 31:48.187
He was bellowing that I was an idiot,

31:48.227 --> 31:51.189
and you just sat there, and
so did you… Of all people.

31:51.229 --> 31:53.025
Now wait. What's that supposed to mean?

31:53.065 --> 31:55.441
It means that it was blatant sexism.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.750
And I expected more from
a person of your caliber.

31:59.790 --> 32:02.912
–Now hold on here.
–Is that the kind of lawyer you are?

32:02.952 --> 32:04.668
Is that the kind of woman?

32:04.689 --> 32:08.592
Honey, the sexist in all this is you.
–Me?

32:08.592 --> 32:11.947
Yeah. You claim to be a staunch
Hillary Clinton supporter.

32:11.987 --> 32:13.491
You… You walked into that booth

32:13.531 --> 32:16.293
and voted against everything
Hillary stands for, and why?

32:16.333 --> 32:18.262
Because the republicans
added to their ticket

32:18.302 --> 32:20.591
someone they referred
to at the convention

32:20.631 --> 32:22.831
as “the hot chick.”
–Oh.

32:23.335 --> 32:26.888
So you just sit quiet and let
me get brutalized on the stand…

32:26.928 --> 32:28.057
I sat there for two reasons.

32:28.097 --> 32:31.296
First, there was no valid
objection to be made.

32:31.728 --> 32:32.792
And second?

32:33.548 --> 32:34.670
You are an idiot.

32:42.610 --> 32:45.910
At-will employment means
exactly that, your honor.

32:46.046 --> 32:47.564
At the employer's will.

32:48.450 --> 32:53.664
Certainly, we can't fire
anybody for race or ethnicity.

32:53.664 --> 32:56.700
But, well, intellect or
a person's lack of it?

32:57.268 --> 32:59.338
Bosses fire people
all the time for that.

32:59.378 --> 33:00.500
But, Mr Davidson,

33:00.605 --> 33:03.635
to fire someone for their
political opinion is still—

33:03.675 --> 33:06.805
Your honor, if I may, that's
one way to look at this.

33:06.845 --> 33:09.507
The other way… Are
we saying that stupidity

33:09.547 --> 33:11.791
can never be grounds for discharge

33:12.048 --> 33:13.808
when it's cloaked in political content?

33:13.848 --> 33:16.248
He's the boss. It's his company.

33:16.344 --> 33:19.619
So as long as he stays within the law,

33:19.659 --> 33:22.040
he gets to hire and fire who he wants.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.400
The unassailable right to vote

33:24.528 --> 33:26.783
is the core principle of any democracy.

33:26.823 --> 33:29.386
And people have the
right to cast their ballot

33:29.426 --> 33:31.592
for whomever they
want… For good reasons

33:31.632 --> 33:33.999
or for bad reasons or
for no reason at all.

33:34.039 --> 33:36.224
Let's face it, your
honor, we as a nation

33:36.264 --> 33:39.920
are horribly uninformed
when it comes to politics.

33:39.960 --> 33:43.122
Approximately one-third of
the people in this country,

33:43.162 --> 33:43.832
people of voting age,

33:43.872 --> 33:45.801
couldn't tell you the name
of our current vice president.

33:45.841 --> 33:48.800
Now admittedly, some of
us like to block it out, but

33:48.840 --> 33:52.248
even so, only two in five
adult Americans

33:52.248 --> 33:54.104
know we have three
branches of government.

33:54.144 --> 33:56.096
And Mr Feldcamp expects his employees

33:56.136 --> 33:59.370
to actually know the
political issues of the day?

33:59.371 --> 34:00.834
Well, today our news programs

34:00.874 --> 34:03.448
consist solely of sensational headlines

34:03.709 --> 34:04.212
and sound bites.

34:04.252 --> 34:06.348
People forego newspapers for the internet,

34:06.388 --> 34:08.710
where instead of relying
on credentialed journalists,

34:08.751 --> 34:12.081
they turn to these bloggers…
Sort of entry-level life-forms

34:12.121 --> 34:16.116
that intellectually have yet to
emerge from the primordial ooze.

34:16.156 --> 34:18.460
This is how we've gotten
the elected officials we've gotten

34:18.501 --> 34:20.688
We've never really cared
about issues. Come on.

34:20.728 --> 34:24.225
We're more concerned with how Hillary
looks in a pantsuit,

34:24.264 --> 34:26.112
or whether Barack can bowl.

34:26.112 --> 34:28.942
We don't always go for
the best or the brightest.

34:28.982 --> 34:31.645
We elect the guy we'd most
like to have a beer with

34:31.685 --> 34:33.974
or the gal we'd most like to
feel up in the back of the car.

34:34.014 --> 34:37.016
Now I certainly wouldn't
pick my airline pilot that way

34:37.056 --> 34:39.192
or my accountant or doctor,

34:39.192 --> 34:41.362
but for my president, so often, it's,

34:41.402 --> 34:43.531
“give me the blue-collar,
lunch-bucket, good ol' boy

34:43.571 --> 34:45.728
who fits in best at
the pancake breakfast.”

34:45.768 --> 34:46.737
The problem with Mr Feldcamp,

34:46.777 --> 34:49.666
and forgive me, I hesitate
to say this about anybody,

34:49.706 --> 34:51.509
but he's an elitist.
–Objection.

34:51.549 --> 34:53.792
I realize that's much worse
than being called stupid.

34:53.831 --> 34:56.208
Mr Shore, let's stay on message.

34:56.208 --> 34:58.111
The message is, we vote for who we like.

34:58.151 --> 35:01.305
It's as simple as that. We
don't need to have a reason.

35:01.345 --> 35:02.475
It's as simple as that.

35:02.515 --> 35:05.178
The founding fathers did
not form a meritocracy.

35:05.218 --> 35:08.432
This is a democracy. We can
be as stupid as we choose.

35:08.472 --> 35:11.472
We're Americans. We're
as simple as that.

35:12.958 --> 35:14.014
All right. Look…

35:14.760 --> 35:15.816
I don't like it.

35:16.632 --> 35:19.272
But just as we don't get into

35:19.272 --> 35:21.761
why a person voted
the way he or she did,

35:21.801 --> 35:23.568
nor do we get into

35:23.568 --> 35:25.532
why a boss terminates
somebody in an at-will.

35:25.572 --> 35:27.824
Whoa, whoa, wait. It
sounds like I'm losing.

35:27.864 --> 35:30.768
Your motion for injunctive relief
is denied.

35:31.113 --> 35:34.611
If she wants to sue for
lost wages, I can't stop her.

35:34.749 --> 35:37.257
But we're done here.
We are adjourned.

35:38.304 --> 35:39.696
I'm sorry, Martha.

35:41.256 --> 35:44.490
You didn't try hard enough.
That's what happened.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.638
I'll be suing you next.

35:48.600 --> 35:50.880
I never liked you.

35:53.344 --> 35:55.984
She seemed much more fun in high school.

35:56.952 --> 35:57.619
Oh, well.

35:58.176 --> 36:00.139
Shirley, in anticipation of winning,

36:00.179 --> 36:02.776
I booked a little celebration
dinner at the Ritz.

36:02.816 --> 36:06.145
The restaurant that comes
equipped with private rooms

36:06.185 --> 36:08.480
should we have too
much celebratory wine.

36:08.520 --> 36:12.150
Shirley, one's life is a sum
of his or her experiences.

36:15.408 --> 36:16.134
Okay, Alan.

36:19.344 --> 36:19.542
Oh.

36:20.400 --> 36:21.984
With Denny's permission.

36:22.937 --> 36:24.389
What? Why do you need…

36:24.872 --> 36:25.730
Because I do.

36:26.907 --> 36:27.567
Till then…

36:29.043 --> 36:30.099
I'll be waiting.

36:40.368 --> 36:42.272
Has the jury reached a verdict?

36:42.312 --> 36:43.424
We have, your honor.

36:43.464 --> 36:44.592
How say you?

36:45.058 --> 36:48.045
“In the matter of the
Commonwealth of Virginia

36:48.085 --> 36:49.082
”vs. Preston Holt

36:49.122 --> 36:52.158
”on the charge of murder
in the second degree,

36:52.590 --> 36:54.042
”we find the defendant

36:54.160 --> 36:55.760
not guilty.”
–Oh.

36:55.770 --> 36:57.965
The court thanks you for your service.

36:58.005 --> 37:01.041
The defendant is free to
go. We are adjourned.

37:01.434 --> 37:03.404
--Thank you, Mr Sack.
--You're welcome.

37:03.444 --> 37:08.768
--I wasn't exactly sure of your strategy there, but…
--Not to worry. Neither was I.

37:08.808 --> 37:10.128
Thank you, Mr Crane.

37:11.677 --> 37:12.997
You're welcome, son.

37:29.198 --> 37:32.229
Do you think it's odd that
when running for office,

37:32.269 --> 37:36.031
having an ivy league education
is considered a liability?

37:36.569 --> 37:36.767
No.

37:37.905 --> 37:38.565
You don't?

37:39.342 --> 37:41.982
No, a Harvard grad took us into Vietnam,

37:42.678 --> 37:44.339
a Yale grad bought us Iraq.

37:44.379 --> 37:45.341
We've learned our lesson.

37:45.381 --> 37:47.181
Denny… Between you and me,

37:47.191 --> 37:51.481
do we really think he made it
through Yale? --With a little help.

37:54.744 --> 37:55.872
Denny, there's…

37:57.552 --> 38:00.336
something a little…

38:01.824 --> 38:04.794
well, delicate, I've been
meaning to discuss.

38:05.325 --> 38:05.655
What?

38:07.930 --> 38:09.910
Well, they say as a man… ages,

38:13.303 --> 38:16.933
he eventually sits alone
with nothing but his memories.

38:17.172 --> 38:18.426
I'm concerned that…

38:19.274 --> 38:20.264
Well, with the…

38:21.544 --> 38:22.072
Mad cow,

38:23.882 --> 38:27.644
you could possibly be robbed
of your memories in the end.

38:29.753 --> 38:31.469
And what a horrible thing,

38:34.159 --> 38:37.063
not being able to even
recollect the things…

38:37.416 --> 38:43.361
That brought you your most profound joy.

38:44.832 --> 38:46.350
Making love to Shirley…

38:46.848 --> 38:50.160
How sad if one day…

38:50.544 --> 38:53.304
You weren't able to remember

38:53.664 --> 38:58.080
all the… wonders of Shirley,

38:58.080 --> 39:00.672
how she… smelled,

39:00.672 --> 39:02.712
how she tasted, how…

39:03.072 --> 39:03.920
I was thinking…

39:03.960 --> 39:07.536
If that day ever came,
and you no longer…

39:09.024 --> 39:12.096
it would be great if I
could tell you about it

39:12.096 --> 39:14.016
to help you remember.

39:14.730 --> 39:17.294
Maybe I should make
love with Shirley once,

39:17.334 --> 39:19.496
just so I'd know—
--You're pathetic.

39:19.536 --> 39:21.839
Exploiting my mad cow

39:21.879 --> 39:25.839
just so you could get in the
sack with Shirley? --All right.

39:26.176 --> 39:28.246
I can't believe you just did that.

39:28.286 --> 39:31.760
Waltzing me down mad cow lane
where there's no memory lane

39:31.800 --> 39:33.456
just so you…
--All right.

39:36.936 --> 39:39.378
Here's where your logic failed, Alan.

39:40.007 --> 39:43.002
First of all, I'll never
be alone because I got you.

39:43.042 --> 39:44.712
Secondly, I could never forget

39:44.752 --> 39:46.681
what it was like to be with Shirley

39:46.721 --> 39:50.813
because there was a magic there
that no man could ever forget.

39:51.718 --> 39:53.368
In fact, there's a chance

39:53.922 --> 39:57.288
that it'll be the last
memory I'll have in the end.

39:58.827 --> 40:02.391
It could be the only thing
I'll talk about in the end.

40:03.830 --> 40:04.688
All day long…

40:06.400 --> 40:07.060
Every day…

40:08.869 --> 40:10.387
I'll tell you about it.

40:11.372 --> 40:12.296
I'll tell you…

40:12.341 --> 40:14.274
How we moved together as one

40:16.012 --> 40:18.479
one night on the beach in Nantucket…

40:19.649 --> 40:21.682
How her breasts were as soft

40:21.884 --> 40:23.930
and as pure as a baby's behind.

40:24.388 --> 40:26.888
--You really are cruel.
--Yes, I am.

40:27.158 --> 40:31.118
Cruel enough to shoot you if
you so much as look at Shirley.

40:36.533 --> 40:38.645
I need a new woman to objectify.

40:39.704 --> 40:41.882
What do you think of Sarah Palin?

40:43.608 --> 40:45.441
Oh, those pouty lips…

40:45.451 --> 40:48.619
And the… those down-to-earth,
slutty good looks…

40:49.682 --> 40:51.605
I've got two things to
say about Sarah Palin…

40:51.645 --> 40:53.097
Right here, right now.

40:57.902 --> 40:59.618
Do you think we're sexist?

40:59.940 --> 41:01.980
Why you're asking?

41:02.660 --> 41:04.237
Just wondering aloud.

41:09.318 --> 41:14.630
What about Shirley and Sarah together?

41:15.438 --> 41:17.758
Here's the ticket.

41:19.174 --> 41:22.056
Who wouldn't vote for that?

41:23.305 --> 41:29.242
