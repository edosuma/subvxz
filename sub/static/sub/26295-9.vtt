06:59.331 --> 07:00.768

07:00.811 --> 07:03.074
Like the way he buttons
his shirt

It's not James.
It's not the man I love.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.437
- You think I'm crazy,
don't you?

07:17.480 --> 07:19.743
- Eh,
it's not my favorite term.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.789
- I'm a particle researcher
at Fermi Lab.

07:21.832 --> 07:24.226
I do the "Times" crossword
every Sunday

07:24.269 --> 07:26.010

07:26.054 --> 07:29.274

of onset for schizophrenia.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.889

what that imposter did

07:34.932 --> 07:36.194

07:36.238 --> 07:39.023
- I told you.
I don't want to press charges.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.643

07:49.686 --> 07:51.862
No one's letting me see her.

07:51.906 --> 07:54.778
- Her hand is fine.
I'm just still--

07:54.822 --> 07:56.432
I'm still trying to figure out

07:56.476 --> 07:57.694
why she stabbed you
in the first place.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.827
- We've been happily married
for 29 years.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.829
I have no idea
why she would do this.

08:01.872 --> 08:06.137
- Any changes to her health
recently of any kind?

08:06.181 --> 08:10.141
- Yes, Amber was diagnosed
with a pituitary adenoma

08:10.185 --> 08:11.447
a month ago.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.622
It's pushing against her brain.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.363
- Oh, I'm very sorry
to hear that.

08:14.406 --> 08:17.540
How is
Is

08:17.584 --> 08:19.324
- Her doctors advised against
the surgery

08:19.368 --> 08:20.761
because of where it
was located.

08:20.804 --> 08:23.459
They're trying to shrink it
using medication.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.635
- Would one of those
medications, by any chance,

08:25.679 --> 08:27.419
be bromocriptine?

08:28.943 --> 08:30.727
- Bromocriptine
significantly boosts

08:30.771 --> 08:32.642
the dopamine in the brain,

08:32.686 --> 08:34.644
and that very well
could have something to do

08:34.688 --> 08:36.733
with Amber's delusion.

08:36.777 --> 08:38.648
- As strange as it may sound,

08:38.692 --> 08:41.521
your wife stabbed you
because, well,

08:41.564 --> 08:45.481
she doesn't believe that
you are actually you.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.874
She's under the delusion

08:46.917 --> 08:49.050
that you've been replaced
by an imposter.

08:49.093 --> 08:51.139
It's actually got
a name too, in fact.

08:51.182 --> 08:55.230
The--the Capgras delusion
and, well, imposter syndrome.

08:55.273 --> 08:58.189
- And this is all a side effect
of the medication she's taking?

08:58.233 --> 08:59.800
- I'm pretty sure it is, yeah.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.715
- The doctor said her
medication's the only thing

09:01.758 --> 09:04.239
keeping the tumor at bay.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.894
- What I want to do is put her
on a very mild antipsychotic

09:06.937 --> 09:10.158
and--and I'd also like to have
one of our own neurosurgeons

09:10.201 --> 09:12.203
review her scans.

09:12.247 --> 09:13.857
- Okay.

09:13.901 --> 09:16.468
- The longer a delusion lasts,
the harder it is to break.

09:16.512 --> 09:19.036
Because this one
came on so suddenly, I--

09:19.080 --> 09:21.735
I'm going to choose
to be optimistic

09:21.778 --> 09:23.911
and I think that
you should too.

09:28.132 --> 09:30.221
- Ethan is bringing his ex
to the wedding.

09:30.265 --> 09:31.745
That doctor from the VA?

09:31.788 --> 09:33.355
- That sounds awkward.

09:33.398 --> 09:35.662
- That would make me insane.
If I were April, I wouldn't--

09:35.705 --> 09:37.968
- Doris, I can hear you.

09:38.665 --> 09:41.581
- We're just worried about you,
is all.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.583
- Don't be.
I'm going with Noah instead.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.628
- Okay.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.412
- And we are going to tear up
the dance floor.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.066
- Okay.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.634
- Fire up the ultrasound,
would you?

09:51.678 --> 09:53.375
So how long have you been
in labor, Lisa?

09:53.418 --> 09:54.985
- Uh, a couple of hours,
maybe?

09:55.029 --> 09:57.118
But the baby's not due
for three more weeks.

09:57.161 --> 10:00.251
- We decided to come
to Chicago as a mini-vacation

10:00.295 --> 10:03.254
before the baby came,
but then this happened.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.735
- Let's check
how far along you are.

10:07.128 --> 10:08.651
- Ah.
Whew.

10:08.695 --> 10:11.001
- Okay, so you're really,
really far along.

10:11.045 --> 10:12.960
Nine centimeters?

10:13.003 --> 10:15.702
Nope, fully dilated.
Ultrasound ready?
