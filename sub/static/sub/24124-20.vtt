WEBVTT

00:00.208 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.208
a friend of mine

00:07.958 --> 00:11.375
he's just Pooh Bear

00:13.958 --> 00:17.500
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.500 --> 00:20.875
I know he's out there

00:24.500 --> 00:28.000
we're so adventurous

00:28.000 --> 00:31.166
and again

00:31.166 --> 00:34.458
and there's nobody home

00:34.458 --> 00:37.875
to count on a friend

00:37.875 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.750 --> 00:45.583
take me, please?

00:45.583 --> 00:48.875
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:10.708 --> 01:13.625
la ta ta ta

01:18.000 --> 01:21.125
Oh! I won't let him
bounce me again!

01:21.125 --> 01:23.625
Oh, I got to hide!
Got to hide!

01:23.625 --> 01:24.750
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

01:24.750 --> 01:26.125
First I give a bounce,

01:26.125 --> 01:27.291
which I follow with a pounce.

01:27.291 --> 01:29.458
An adjustable, combustible--

01:29.458 --> 01:31.208
You see, I really must-able.

01:31.208 --> 01:34.750
Truly and unruly, duly
just a little bounce.

01:37.375 --> 01:38.875
Howdy, long ears.

01:38.875 --> 01:40.208
Aah! Hah hah hah hah!

01:40.208 --> 01:43.000
Say, what'cha doing
lying down on the job?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.208
Look, I've got
cabbages to harvest,

01:45.208 --> 01:47.833
so would you mind not
bouncing for a few days?

01:47.833 --> 01:50.416
Not bounce?

01:50.416 --> 01:52.333
But that's-- that's--

01:52.333 --> 01:54.166
Both: What tiggers do best.

01:54.166 --> 01:56.583
Yes, yes, I know.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.625
Wait. I've got it!

01:59.708 --> 02:01.166
There you are, Tigger.

02:01.166 --> 02:02.583
Castle Ridge.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.833
Practice your bouncing
on that.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.416
Ha ha ha ha!

02:06.416 --> 02:09.000
I can get up there
in only two bounces.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.166
Hmm. The best bouncer
in the world

02:12.166 --> 02:14.208
can do it in one.

02:14.208 --> 02:17.625
Well, dust off that trophy,
palaroo.

02:23.458 --> 02:25.208
Yaah!

02:27.000 --> 02:31.208
Hmm. This is going to take
some serious practicizing.

02:31.208 --> 02:35.000
Mm. Mm. Uh, nope.
Nope, nope, nope.
Don't like it.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.583
Don't like it at all.

02:36.583 --> 02:39.125
That stack of cabbages
is nothing

02:39.125 --> 02:41.708
but an accident
waiting to happen.

02:41.708 --> 02:44.583
Oh, accidents only happen
when Tigger is around,

02:44.583 --> 02:46.875
and I've got him
gone for days.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.583
- Hey, Rabbit!
- Aah!

02:53.291 --> 02:56.750
Yaah!

02:57.750 --> 03:00.208
That ridge is impossible.

03:00.208 --> 03:03.083
I can't even make it
with my bestest bounce.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.875
You got to help me.

03:04.875 --> 03:09.333
Help you? I ought to--
ought to--

03:10.500 --> 03:13.625
ought to help you
with your bouncing.

03:13.625 --> 03:15.083
You mean it?

03:15.083 --> 03:17.250
Of course, dear Tigger.

03:17.250 --> 03:19.583
After all, I'm related

03:19.583 --> 03:22.458
to the world's
greatest bouncer:

03:22.458 --> 03:27.000
the Awesome Bunny
of, uh, Upsidasia.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.416
Ha ha ha! What do bunnies
know about bouncing?

03:31.416 --> 03:33.125
Why, they invented it.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.625
Wait a minute.

03:34.625 --> 03:38.458
Who's this Upsidasia guy?

03:38.458 --> 03:42.458
You know,
the Awesome Bunny?

03:42.458 --> 03:43.583
Oh?

03:43.583 --> 03:45.458
Uh, oh, yes.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.416
Best bouncer around.

03:47.416 --> 03:50.875
Why, he could jump
Castle Ridge in his sleep.

03:50.875 --> 03:53.375
Must work at night.

03:53.375 --> 03:57.708
And I know the secret to his
stratospheric bouncing,

03:57.708 --> 03:59.208
which I'll tell you

03:59.208 --> 04:02.625
if you pick up
all my cabbages.

04:02.625 --> 04:05.208
Gee, thanks,
bunny boy. Ha ha!

04:05.208 --> 04:06.750
It's a deal!

04:06.750 --> 04:08.625
Ho ho! He fell for it.

04:08.625 --> 04:10.000
Ha ha ha ha! Hoo hoo!

04:10.000 --> 04:12.750
Am I going to
teach him a lesson.

04:15.375 --> 04:17.208
Get along,
little coleslaw.

04:17.208 --> 04:19.166
Hee hee hee hyah!

04:20.333 --> 04:21.750
Hurry
with that spring.

04:21.750 --> 04:23.291
There isn't much time.

04:23.291 --> 04:24.833
Tigger: Yahoo!

04:24.833 --> 04:26.000
Oh.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.000
All right, bunny boy.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.833
I got your green
basketballs.

04:30.833 --> 04:33.708
Now how about that bunny
bouncing secret?

04:33.708 --> 04:35.083
Rabbit: Ahem.

04:35.083 --> 04:36.958
Behold.

04:36.958 --> 04:41.625
The jumping shoes
of the Awesome Bunny
of Upsidasia.

04:41.625 --> 04:44.708
But, uh, do they--
do they really work?

04:44.708 --> 04:46.125
Watch.

04:47.416 --> 04:51.333
1, 2, 3.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.333
Aah!

04:55.000 --> 04:57.708
That was
the most amazing bounce

04:57.708 --> 05:00.166
these peepers
have ever peeped!

05:00.166 --> 05:02.375
I got to have those shoes.

05:02.375 --> 05:04.708
Ahem. Uh, sure, Tigger.

05:04.708 --> 05:07.208
Uh, just let me
get the, uh,

05:07.208 --> 05:09.583
knots
out of the shoelaces, hmm?

05:11.583 --> 05:14.375
You sure taught him
a lesson.

05:14.375 --> 05:16.458
It's not over yet.

05:16.458 --> 05:19.500
But, uh, with all
that junk in there,

05:19.500 --> 05:21.291
he'll never
be able to bounce.

05:21.291 --> 05:22.958
That's the point.

05:22.958 --> 05:26.958
Now wait a minute.
A little prank's one thing,

05:26.958 --> 05:29.500
but this is getting
carried away.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.500
But he deserves it, right?

05:31.500 --> 05:32.875
-Huh.
-

05:32.875 --> 05:34.875
Well, I think so.

05:34.875 --> 05:36.958
Oh, thanks, long ears.

05:36.958 --> 05:38.583
Now I'll leap
up that old ridge

05:38.583 --> 05:40.583
with the greatest of ease.

05:42.875 --> 05:46.583
Ahem. The, uh, shoes are
for big bunnies, Tigger.

05:46.583 --> 05:49.083
Might take some
getting used to.

05:49.083 --> 05:52.583
You're right. I just need
to practice a bit.

05:52.583 --> 05:54.208
Like for a week.

05:56.375 --> 05:58.166
-

05:58.166 --> 06:00.375
-

06:00.375 --> 06:02.083
Pooh: Hello, Tigger.

06:02.083 --> 06:04.708
Oh. Hi, guys.

06:04.708 --> 06:08.625
Uh, Tigger, Piglet and I
were wondering--

06:09.875 --> 06:12.416
...why your shoes
were being so loud.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.833
Aren't they great?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.250
They're helping me bounce.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.958
Excuse me, Tigger,

06:17.958 --> 06:20.125
but they look like they're
holding you down.

06:20.125 --> 06:23.583
Nah. Rabbit says I just
got to get used to them.

06:25.333 --> 06:28.166
Where did Rabbit
get them?

06:28.166 --> 06:30.583
Uh, borrowed them
from the Awful Bunny

06:30.583 --> 06:33.166
of, uh, Upsidedownsia.

06:33.166 --> 06:34.458
An Awful Bunny?

06:34.458 --> 06:36.958
Yeah. Big fella
who jumps at night.

06:36.958 --> 06:38.958
Bounces while you sleep
or something like that.

06:38.958 --> 06:40.958
Well, I got to get
back to work.

06:42.583 --> 06:47.500
Poor Tigger. He looks
so very tired.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.375
Why doesn't anyone
think my joke is funny?

06:59.375 --> 07:01.875
Those shoes have to be
around here somewhere.

07:01.875 --> 07:05.708
Hmm. Got to get up
to that ridge.

07:07.625 --> 07:10.375
I can do that in my sleep.

07:12.333 --> 07:15.833
Oh, my.
Tigger's sleep-bouncing.

07:15.833 --> 07:19.250
I'd better find those shoes
before this goes any further.

07:20.875 --> 07:23.458
-

07:25.000 --> 07:26.250
Oof!

07:26.250 --> 07:27.708
Oh, bother.

07:31.416 --> 07:35.166
Pooh, Pooh.
Did he get you, too?

07:35.166 --> 07:39.875
If the it was something
that jumps on your tummy,

07:39.875 --> 07:41.375
yes.

07:41.375 --> 07:43.333
It must have been
the Awful Bunny.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.416
He only bounces
at night, remember?

07:45.416 --> 07:48.500
He must have come
looking for his shoes.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.250
Oh, d-d-dear.
We have to warn Tigger.

07:53.375 --> 07:55.250
Oh, no. He's back.

07:58.416 --> 08:00.458
Pooh: Wake up, Tigger.

08:00.458 --> 08:03.000
Oh, morning, buddy bear.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.333
What you doing here?

08:04.333 --> 08:06.875
The Awful Bunny
is in the woods.

08:06.875 --> 08:08.583
Piglet:
Look at the mess, Pooh.

08:08.583 --> 08:11.625
The Bunny must have been here
looking for his shoes.

08:11.625 --> 08:15.083
Hoo hoo! Well, it's
a good thing I hid them.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.958
Aah!

08:18.000 --> 08:19.500
Tigger:
Did you hear something?

08:22.208 --> 08:23.875
Uh, Tigger,

08:23.875 --> 08:26.500
you don't seem
to be going very far.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.708
Uh, upwardly speaking.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.375
Yeah. But just think
how bad I'd be bouncing

08:31.375 --> 08:33.750
if I didn't have
these super shoes.

08:33.750 --> 08:37.125
But-- But--
But the Awful Bunny
wants them back.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.958
Sorry.
I won't give them up

08:38.958 --> 08:41.250
until I make it
to the tippy-top.

08:41.250 --> 08:43.208
Rabbit convinced me.

08:43.208 --> 08:44.708
Right, old long ears?

08:44.708 --> 08:47.875
Uh, I suppose so, Tigger.

08:50.583 --> 08:54.083
Oh, so I didn't make it
to the tippy-top today.

08:55.458 --> 08:57.416
Just wait until tomorrow.

08:57.416 --> 09:00.583
But the--
B-B-Bunny.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.708
Well, if he wants
these shoes,

09:02.708 --> 09:05.000
he'll have to get
by us first.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.750
You know, I'm not sure
this is really necessary.

09:09.750 --> 09:13.125
But, Rabbit,
he's your relative,

09:13.125 --> 09:15.458
and they are his shoes.

09:15.458 --> 09:18.000
Oh, uh, heh, that's right.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.458
Silly of me to forget.

09:20.458 --> 09:23.500
All right, kiddos,
we're locked up tight.

09:23.500 --> 09:26.958
But we can't let our guard
down for a second.

09:26.958 --> 09:27.958
Both: Right.

09:37.458 --> 09:40.125
Now I'll get rid
of these shoes.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.750
- Got to get up that ridge.
- Oh, no. Not again.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.958
- Aah!
- Oh, bother.

09:52.958 --> 09:55.500
The Bunny must have
come for his shoes.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.583
He took Tigger, too.

09:58.583 --> 10:00.708
There it goes.

10:00.708 --> 10:03.708
Quick, Rabbit.
We must save Tigger.

10:03.708 --> 10:05.583
Yeah, uh, what?

10:08.708 --> 10:11.958
I'm sure I heard
the bouncing bounce this way.

10:23.458 --> 10:25.625
Why, it's only Tigger.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.166
Wake up, Tigger!

10:29.166 --> 10:31.875
Ohh. Hiya, buddy bear.

10:31.875 --> 10:34.000
Is, uh-- Hey!

10:34.000 --> 10:35.333
How did I get up here?

10:35.333 --> 10:37.500
The Awful Bunny
took you.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.250
Uh, right, Rabbit?

10:39.250 --> 10:43.416
Uh, yes. And he took
back his shoes.

10:43.416 --> 10:45.083
-

10:46.166 --> 10:47.333
Yipe! Whoo-hoo!

10:47.333 --> 10:50.166
That's a flimflam fib.

10:50.166 --> 10:52.958
Never was no Awesome Bunny.

10:52.958 --> 10:57.250
You invented him
and these shoes.

10:57.250 --> 11:00.458
You mean
Rabbit deliberately

11:00.458 --> 11:04.000
put big old weights
on my footsies?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.250
But, uh, let me explain.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.000
Bunny, old buddy,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.583
you knew those shoes would
build up my muskles.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.583
And thanks to you,
I proved

11:13.583 --> 11:16.000
I'm the best bouncer
in the whole world!

11:16.000 --> 11:18.500
Then-- Then you forgive me?

11:18.500 --> 11:22.083
Forgive? Why, the first
thing tomorrow morning,

11:22.083 --> 11:24.708
you're going to help me
train for my next bounce.

11:24.708 --> 11:26.583
- Next bounce?
- Yeah.

11:26.583 --> 11:28.875
I heard about this cow
that jumped over the moon.

11:28.875 --> 11:31.458
Listen, us tiggers
can't let no cows

11:31.458 --> 11:34.458
- be the bestest jumpers.
-

11:36.083 --> 11:37.333
Well, what do you know?

11:37.333 --> 11:39.500
Overcome with exciterment.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.166
This is the last straw.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.333
Pooh! Pooh Bear!

11:57.333 --> 12:01.250
Open this door
this very minute!

12:01.250 --> 12:03.000
Hello, Rabbit.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.250
Enough small talk, Pooh.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.833
I want my shovel,

12:05.833 --> 12:08.166
and I'm going to get it!

12:08.166 --> 12:09.583
Your shovel?

12:09.583 --> 12:13.458
You promised you'd
return it last week,

12:13.458 --> 12:14.708
you silly bear.

12:14.708 --> 12:16.416
If I don't begin
planting my carrots

12:16.416 --> 12:18.208
at exactly
the stroke of 12,

12:18.208 --> 12:21.291
how will they grow up
to be midnight snacks?

12:21.291 --> 12:23.750
I don't know, Rabbit. How?

12:24.875 --> 12:26.458
Aah!

12:26.458 --> 12:29.958
Pooh, no more borrowing.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.750
Shovel. Now.

12:31.750 --> 12:36.458
Actually,
I think I left it
in the closet.

12:36.458 --> 12:38.000
Aha!

12:39.166 --> 12:40.458
But, Rabbit--

12:40.458 --> 12:42.166
No buts about it.

12:43.958 --> 12:45.583
Here you go, Rabbit.

12:45.583 --> 12:47.375
Your shovel.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.000
Ohh.

12:50.458 --> 12:52.708
Pooh Bear borrows this,

12:52.708 --> 12:55.625
Pooh Bear borrows that.

12:55.625 --> 12:58.208
Who does he think I am?

12:58.208 --> 12:59.833
Aah!

12:59.833 --> 13:02.333
Of course,
there is one problem

13:02.333 --> 13:05.000
with planting carrots
in the dark:

13:05.000 --> 13:07.500
you can't see
what you're doing.

13:13.333 --> 13:16.875
I'm certain Gopher won't mind
my borrowing his helmet.

13:16.875 --> 13:19.583
I'll have it back to him
before he knows it.

13:31.875 --> 13:34.583
Aah!

13:34.583 --> 13:38.708
Robbers! Burglars!

13:40.583 --> 13:42.458
A body can't even sleep

13:42.458 --> 13:45.000
without getting
something snatched, see?

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
It looks like
your head, Gopher.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.500
Yep. It's a head,
all right.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.958
It was--

13:51.958 --> 13:55.208
Well, there's supposed
to be a helmet on it!

13:55.208 --> 13:58.250
Someone borrowed my helmet!

13:58.250 --> 14:00.125
Oh, my.

14:00.125 --> 14:04.708
I forgot to return
Gopher's helmet-- me.

14:04.708 --> 14:06.708
Oh, d-d-dear.

14:06.708 --> 14:10.416
And without your light,
it's so...dark.

14:10.416 --> 14:13.375
Isn't it?

14:13.375 --> 14:16.333
Yeah. Good thing you're not
afraid of the dark, Gopher.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.333
Good thing.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.750
And who knows
what's living down there?

14:22.750 --> 14:24.000
Living?

14:24.000 --> 14:27.416
Yeah. Like jagulars.

14:27.416 --> 14:29.250
J-J-Jagulars?

14:29.250 --> 14:31.416
Or-- Or heffalumps.

14:31.416 --> 14:34.000
Heh heh heh. Heffamadingles?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.333
Or maybe...

14:36.583 --> 14:38.166
woozles.

14:38.166 --> 14:41.625
Uh, w-w-woozles? Heh heh.

14:41.625 --> 14:43.333
Yeah. You never know

14:43.333 --> 14:45.458
what kind of
ickety-stickety things

14:45.458 --> 14:48.291
live down in the d-dark.

14:49.291 --> 14:50.750
Dark?

14:50.750 --> 14:52.958
Yike!

14:52.958 --> 14:57.833
Hmm. I wonder if it was I
who lost Gopher's helmet.

14:57.833 --> 15:02.291
Oh, no. no.
I'm sure it wasn't you.

15:02.291 --> 15:07.083
Well, I have been borrowing
a lot of things lately.

15:07.083 --> 15:10.125
And since I don't
remember losing it,

15:10.125 --> 15:11.708
I must have lost it.

15:11.708 --> 15:15.625
If I did remember,
then it wouldn't be lost.

15:15.625 --> 15:18.166
Oh, Pooh, how could you?

15:18.166 --> 15:20.000
Yeah! How could you?

15:20.000 --> 15:23.625
Uh, look, maybe it'll
show up very soon,

15:23.625 --> 15:25.458
any second.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.875
Where is it? Where is it?

15:27.875 --> 15:29.625
It has to be here somewhere.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.375
Oh, my.

15:31.375 --> 15:33.833
I must have buried it.

15:33.833 --> 15:36.291
Pooh, do you think
it's a good idea

15:36.291 --> 15:38.000
to go down there all alone

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
in the dark?

15:40.000 --> 15:42.333
Dark? Yaah!

15:42.333 --> 15:44.708
But I'm not alone,
Piglet.

15:44.708 --> 15:47.750
I have my jar of honey.

15:47.750 --> 15:49.375
Do you remember

15:49.375 --> 15:51.458
leaving Gopher's
helmet in his tunnels?

15:51.458 --> 15:53.333
- No.
-

15:53.333 --> 15:57.000
But I also don't remember
taking his helmet.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.375
Therefore, I probably lost it
where I don't remember going.

16:01.375 --> 16:04.166
Aah!

16:06.833 --> 16:09.000
Is it-- It's here?
It's got to be here.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.416
Oh, no, no, no.
Where, where? Ohh!

16:12.833 --> 16:16.875
Hmm. Now,
which way would I go

16:16.875 --> 16:19.166
if I was a lost helmet?

16:21.333 --> 16:24.500
Hmm. Looks like helmet tracks.

16:24.500 --> 16:28.291
Hellooo!

16:28.291 --> 16:31.291
Something,
uh, d-down there

16:31.291 --> 16:33.375
in-- in-- in the dark.

16:33.375 --> 16:34.583
Dark?

16:40.125 --> 16:41.708
Aah!

16:43.958 --> 16:47.250
Can't say I like
my face, either.

16:47.250 --> 16:48.583
Rabbit: What'll I do?
What'll I do?

16:48.583 --> 16:50.083
I got to find it.
Got to find it.

16:50.083 --> 16:51.083
Ooh hoo hoo. Ah ha ha.

16:51.083 --> 16:52.083
Got to find it.

16:59.291 --> 17:00.708
Aah!

17:00.708 --> 17:03.416
R-Rabbit, quick!
P-Pooh, Pooh, hurry!

17:03.416 --> 17:06.416
Get the ladder!
Uh, boom-boom and noises!

17:06.416 --> 17:10.291
And the honey jar,
and he's all alone,
and-- and-- and--

17:10.291 --> 17:13.208
Old fluff and stuff went
to find Gopher's helmet.

17:13.208 --> 17:17.208
What? Doesn't he know
he could get lost
in the dark?

17:17.208 --> 17:19.125
Gopher: Dark? Aah!

17:19.125 --> 17:23.125
Uh, maybe I'd better go
look for Pooh myself.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.250
If long ears
can risk his life

17:25.250 --> 17:28.083
for old fuzzy top,
then me, too.

17:28.083 --> 17:30.291
Might as well go, too.

17:30.291 --> 17:33.625
Rabbit's an inspiration
to all of us.

17:33.625 --> 17:36.958
Yaah!

17:46.500 --> 17:49.708
Helmet! Is that you?

17:49.708 --> 17:51.583
Yaah!

17:52.875 --> 17:54.583
Hello, Tigger.

17:54.583 --> 17:57.208
I didn't expect
to see you down here.

17:57.208 --> 17:59.833
I-- I came to rescue
you, buddy bear.

17:59.833 --> 18:02.500
I-- I thought
you might be lost.

18:02.500 --> 18:06.750
I'm not lost. I'm right
where I'm standing.

18:06.750 --> 18:10.875
Unfortunately, where I'm
standing may be lost.

18:10.875 --> 18:13.625
- What's that? What's that?

18:15.458 --> 18:17.708
Yaah!

18:18.708 --> 18:20.333
Hello, Eeyore.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.833
Have you come
to rescue me, too?

18:26.625 --> 18:28.125
Yaah!

18:29.125 --> 18:30.250
Hello, Rabbit.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.458
If you're lost,

18:32.458 --> 18:34.625
you've come
to the right place.

18:34.625 --> 18:37.833
Yeah. Because of buddy bear
taking Gopher's helmet,

18:37.833 --> 18:39.875
we're going to be
down here forever.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.708
Or longer.

18:41.708 --> 18:44.583
No, no, no.
We mustn't blame Pooh.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.583
I mean, anyone
can make a mistake.

18:47.583 --> 18:50.208
Uh, well, not a smart
bunny like you.

18:50.208 --> 18:52.875
Don't worry. Just follow me

18:52.875 --> 18:55.500
and try to think
like a helmet.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.500
Hello, helmet!

18:58.500 --> 19:01.708
I'm afraid it's up to me
to go down and rescue them.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.375
Pooh: Hellooo!

19:04.375 --> 19:06.583
Oh, d-d-dear.

19:09.875 --> 19:12.875
That's awful brave
of you, Piglet.

19:12.875 --> 19:15.875
I never thought
you had it in you.

19:15.875 --> 19:18.000
B-B-But I don't.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.125
Yow!

19:20.125 --> 19:22.250
By sassafras,

19:22.250 --> 19:25.583
if a little whippersnapper
like him can face the dark,

19:25.583 --> 19:28.250
then so can I.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.583
Huh? Eh? I said it!

19:31.583 --> 19:34.083
Dark. Dark.

19:34.083 --> 19:35.583
Dark.

19:35.583 --> 19:41.291
Da-- Aah!

19:45.000 --> 19:46.458
Helmet.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.208
This is terribibble.

19:52.208 --> 19:55.416
Lost zillions of miles
down under.

19:55.416 --> 19:58.750
Bunny boy, you got
to get us out of here.

19:58.750 --> 20:01.208
You're our only
hopelessness.

20:01.208 --> 20:04.375
But I don't know how.

20:04.375 --> 20:07.958
It's true, Rabbit.
You knew I lost the helmet.

20:07.958 --> 20:11.083
You'll know how
to get us out. Please.

20:11.083 --> 20:13.958
B-But I can't.

20:13.958 --> 20:15.750
You've got it all wrong.

20:15.750 --> 20:18.708
You didn't lose
Gopher's helmet, Pooh.

20:18.708 --> 20:19.958
I did.

20:19.958 --> 20:22.166
That's all right, Rabbit.

20:22.166 --> 20:24.833
As long as one of us did.

20:24.833 --> 20:28.583
I wouldn't feel right
if the helmet lost itself.

20:30.250 --> 20:33.125
Gopher: Hello!

20:33.125 --> 20:34.875
It's the dark.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.416
It's coming to get us.

20:36.416 --> 20:39.291
Oh, my. Oh, my.
It's all my fault.

20:39.291 --> 20:40.458
Pooh: Oh, bother.

20:40.458 --> 20:42.125
Homph!

20:42.125 --> 20:43.458
- Piglet: Pooh!
-

20:43.458 --> 20:45.500
Yaah!

20:45.500 --> 20:48.458
Ah. So there you all are.

20:48.458 --> 20:52.375
Heh. Should have known
you'd be lollygagging around.

20:52.375 --> 20:53.750
Pooh!

20:53.750 --> 20:55.583
Oh, we was just resting.

20:55.583 --> 20:58.458
Ha ha ha. Being
a zillion miles underground

20:58.458 --> 21:00.166
is kind of tiring,
you know.

21:00.166 --> 21:02.000
A zillion miles?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
Ha!

21:04.625 --> 21:08.000
Oh! Good old terra cotta.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.125
You know, Piglet,

21:10.125 --> 21:12.625
a zillion miles underground

21:12.625 --> 21:15.333
certainly looks a lot
like Rabbit's house.

21:15.333 --> 21:19.708
It, uh, ahem, is
Rabbit's house, uh, Pooh.

21:19.708 --> 21:21.583
I don't know
what happened, Gopher.

21:21.583 --> 21:23.625
I borrowed it. Only
for a second, really,

21:23.625 --> 21:24.958
just to plant some carrots,

21:24.958 --> 21:27.250
and I worked all night
and was so tired

21:27.250 --> 21:29.708
that I came back at dawn
and leapt on the bed

21:29.708 --> 21:32.166
- and fell right to sleep and--
-

21:32.166 --> 21:33.875
Oh, that's some pillow.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.875
That's no pillow.
That's Gopher's helmet.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.875
Helmet?

21:38.875 --> 21:42.833
Here, Gopher. Let me
return this to you.

21:42.833 --> 21:46.208
Thanks, sonny, but I
don't need it anymore.

21:46.208 --> 21:47.583
Don't need it?

21:47.583 --> 21:49.208
Nope. Found out

21:49.208 --> 21:51.875
there's nothing to be
afraid of in the dark.

21:51.875 --> 21:55.125
Dark? Ohh...

21:55.125 --> 21:57.458
Now what's the matter
with him?

21:57.458 --> 22:02.083
It was probably
something he didn't eat.

22:02.083 --> 22:03.458
Do you think he'd mind

22:03.458 --> 22:07.833
if I borrowed
a small smackerel?

22:07.833 --> 22:10.250
No more borrowing!

22:12.000 --> 22:13.291
Heh heh.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.458
But you can have some.
