<b>F R A S I E R (10x19)
- <i>Some Assembly Required</i> -

00:09.116 --> 00:11.928
So, on behalf of myself, 
the volunteers,

00:12.029 --> 00:14.951
and especially the team from KACL

00:15.652 --> 00:20.483
I'd like to welcome you, 
the Grant family, to your 
new Habitat For Humanity house.

00:20.784 --> 00:22.784
Uh, Ronnie, if I may...

00:23.580 --> 00:28.990
When my co-workers first signed me up 
for this project without my knowledge, 
I was, uh...

00:29.558 --> 00:31.758
well, I'll say it: 
irked.

00:32.755 --> 00:36.750
But I'm glad they did.  
Because I've had a chance to learn 
the pride

00:37.424 --> 00:42.000
that comes when you build something 
with your own two hands.

00:42.351 --> 00:47.050
As carpenter's helper, 
I sanded that newel post out there.

00:47.327 --> 00:51.341
As painter's helpers's assistant, 
I stirred the paint

00:51.442 --> 00:53.461
for the trim in the kitchen.

00:54.220 --> 00:59.200
I was also surprised to learn 
that electricians don't have helpers.

01:01.534 --> 01:04.000
It's getting dark...
-Oh, right, right, of course.

01:04.569 --> 01:07.003
Enjoy your new home.
I know I did,

01:07.104 --> 01:09.690
and if ever these walls 
should tumble...

01:10.091 --> 01:13.000
keep an eye out for my Harvard 
class ring.  Thank you.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.977
It's hard to believe 
the house is finally ours.

01:17.078 --> 01:20.200
We can't thank everybody enough.  
Thank you.

01:24.980 --> 01:28.327
Are you sure you took enough credit 
for the house?
-I took just enough, Roz.

01:28.428 --> 01:32.000
It's not my fault I'm not licensed 
to use a plug-in tool.

01:33.066 --> 01:36.500
Frasier, those guys... 
you don't need a... 
never mind.

01:40.886 --> 01:44.310
I'm sorry I'm so late, Martin.
-No problem, everything okay?

01:44.411 --> 01:47.600
My mum is a mean, spiteful woman!

01:49.046 --> 01:52.800
Uh, maybe we should talk this out 
before you put your hands on me.

01:53.220 --> 01:56.391
Daphne and her mom had a big fight 
this morning.  Gertrude's been 
especially difficult

01:56.492 --> 02:00.500
to live with lately. 
-Yeah, last night, she got 
the neighbor's cat drunk again.

02:02.104 --> 02:04.400
One of them threw up 
in the hot tub.

02:05.121 --> 02:09.526
Well, I told her, 
we will not tolerate this 
inconsiderate behavior anymore.

02:09.727 --> 02:13.869
If she wants to be part of this 
household, she has to get off her 
lazy bum and help out.

02:13.970 --> 02:17.600
How did I put it, Niles?
-I couldn't hear you.  
I was in the panic room.

02:18.762 --> 02:21.800
But you looked very forceful 
on the monitor.

02:22.620 --> 02:26.687
Anyhow, she pinched me keys 
and drove off in a snit.  
Niles had to drive me over.

02:26.790 --> 02:29.613
Why I'm so mad 
I could break something!

02:29.814 --> 02:33.550
Are you ready, Martin?
-Let's give it a few more minutes.

02:36.869 --> 02:40.050
What is this?  Has Frasier been 
attempting the laundry again?

02:40.640 --> 02:43.800
No, that's Eddie's.  
It's for a safety talk 
Eddie and I are giving

02:43.901 --> 02:46.897
at Glenbrook Elementary.
-Sounds like fun. 
-Oh, yeah!

02:46.998 --> 02:51.800
We're replacing a talking parrot act.  
Officer Chirpy and Sergeant Bob.

02:52.856 --> 02:56.800
Dick Chirpy was one of the finest 
officers I ever served with.

02:57.268 --> 03:01.374
It's funny, you know, with a name 
like Chirpy, you'd think he'd be 
the parrot, but as I said before,

03:01.475 --> 03:05.000
He wasn't, he was the guy.  
The parrot being Bob.

03:06.922 --> 03:08.522
That's fascinating.

03:10.100 --> 03:13.524
Dad, are you sure you want to do this? 
I spoke at a career day once.

03:13.625 --> 03:18.100
It was a disaster.  All the taunting 
and yelling, I haven't been so...

03:19.174 --> 03:22.374
I haven't been so afraid of third 
graders since ninth grade.

03:23.596 --> 03:26.800
Well, thanks for the warning, son, 
but Eddie and I will be fine.

03:26.900 --> 03:31.398
Hey!  Would you like to see part 
of the act?  -We'd love to. 
-Oh, great. Take a seat.

03:31.748 --> 03:34.648
Come on, Eddie!  
Show time!

03:37.002 --> 03:41.800
Okay.  Eddie, what should you do 
before you cross a street?

03:43.632 --> 03:46.350
That's right!  
Look both ways.

03:46.980 --> 03:49.780
How about if a stranger 
approaches you?

03:53.932 --> 03:57.932
Right again!  Yell, and run 
to someone you trust.

03:58.968 --> 04:02.868
Okay.  
What about if you catch on fire?

04:06.176 --> 04:09.650
That's right!  
Stop, drop, and roll!

04:10.283 --> 04:13.300
What do you think?
-I think the kids are going 
to love it.

04:13.555 --> 04:16.355
I see Dad's been showing you 
the act.

04:24.614 --> 04:28.800
Hmm.  Darn.
This drawer isn't closing properly.

04:30.045 --> 04:33.500
I'd better go get my tools 
and have a look at it.

04:36.988 --> 04:41.300
You sure you know what you're doing? 
-Niles, please. I built a house.

04:42.285 --> 04:46.580
I think I can handle a simple drawer.  
You know, it's probably 
the slidey thing.

04:48.652 --> 04:51.627
Or the drawer may have become warped.  
If that's the case, 
then she's going to need

04:51.728 --> 04:54.328
to be planed, sanded, and refitted.

04:56.465 --> 04:59.430
Or you could turn the stapler 
on its side.

05:04.601 --> 05:09.500
I paid good money 
for an upright stapler.

05:14.516 --> 05:16.716
.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.497
Dr. Crane, it's great to see you!  
What are you doing here?

05:19.598 --> 05:22.727
I was in the neighborhood, and 
I thought I'd stop by to see 
how you two are coming along,

05:22.828 --> 05:25.771
and I also wanted to drop off this...
this little gift for you.

05:25.972 --> 05:29.862
I thought it would be perfect 
for the house.
-Thank you very much, very generous.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.976
How lovely. Thank you.
-Come in. Make yourself at home.

05:33.077 --> 05:36.038
Sorry for all the boxes.
-Oh, no, please don't apologize.

05:36.139 --> 05:41.726
You know, this is a beautiful print.
-Oh, thank you.  Actually, we've been 
debating about where to hang this.

05:41.827 --> 05:45.450
I was thinking up on the wall. 
-Uh-huh.  
Well, that's an excellent place,

05:46.523 --> 05:51.109
but uh, however, it comes to my mind 
that actually if you hung it 
opposite the front door,

05:51.210 --> 05:55.084
it would be the first thing 
your guests see when they arrive.
-What a wonderful idea. -Thanks.

05:55.736 --> 05:58.134
Eh, um, actually, if you don't mind 
a little suggestion...

05:58.235 --> 06:00.835
um, if you put the couch, say... 

06:02.929 --> 06:07.300
...like this, you see, you've got 
a lovely conversation area,

06:07.701 --> 06:11.301
as well as a clear view of the TV.

06:11.621 --> 06:15.500
You really have a gift for this.
-Oh, gosh, it's hardly a gift.

06:15.805 --> 06:19.405
It's... a knack perhaps, 
a... a flair at best.

06:20.797 --> 06:24.908
Wow. Wait until we tell people 
that our living room was decorated 
by Dr. Frasier Crane.

06:25.009 --> 06:29.055
Oh, please.  Hardly decorated, but 
you know, if you'd like to sit down

06:29.156 --> 06:31.973
and sketch out a few ideas together, 
I'd be delighted.

06:32.074 --> 06:36.513
Seriously? -Sure. -Wow. Then 
I insist that you stay for dinner.

06:36.714 --> 06:40.013
Well, how can I refuse?  
Here, let me take this for you.

06:40.481 --> 06:44.069
You know, I had a lot of time 
to think about this space 
when I was watching the plaster dry.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.670
I was plaster watcher.

06:48.343 --> 06:50.743
.

06:51.323 --> 06:54.956
Can I help you?
-Mum, what are you doing here?

06:55.157 --> 06:58.198
Just following orders.  
Working myself ill,

06:58.299 --> 07:02.249
so I can contribute to Her Highness's 
household coffers.

07:02.350 --> 07:07.444
I'm sure Daphne only meant to suggest 
that perhaps you might help out 
a little bit more at home.

07:07.545 --> 07:11.456
"Contribute" is the word she 
shouted down from her high horse.

07:11.657 --> 07:14.607
But I'll be glad to "help out" 
with the wages I earn

07:14.708 --> 07:18.008
serving strangers 
with my arthritic hands.

07:18.492 --> 07:21.900
Now, how may I provide you 
with excellent service?

07:22.788 --> 07:26.288
Well, uh, what would you recommend?
-Not having children. 

07:29.352 --> 07:32.523
What does she think she's doing?
-I guess this is just...

07:32.824 --> 07:36.449
her childish attempt to embarrass 
us. Working here, she's hoping

07:36.550 --> 07:39.798
we'll retreat in humiliation.
-I stopped being humiliated

07:39.899 --> 07:43.500
after she showed up in that 
Spring Break video.

07:44.472 --> 07:46.520
Hello.
-Hi, Dad.

07:46.721 --> 07:51.650
Well, it's been 60 years, but 
once again, I am the toast 
of the second grade.

07:52.875 --> 07:55.101
Congratulations.
-So it went well, then?

07:55.302 --> 08:00.337
Oh, the kids loved it!  When it was 
over, they all ran out and 
gave me and Eddie big hugs.

08:00.738 --> 08:04.000
Well, Dad, then you might just 
want to consider having that uniform 
cleaned.

08:04.490 --> 08:07.650
Kids that age are always carrying 
germs. God knows what you picked up.

08:08.569 --> 08:13.150
Oh, I'm sure any germs on their 
hands were jarred loose 
by their wild applause.

08:14.041 --> 08:17.768
The principal asked us to come back 
and have an assembly for all 
the fourth graders.

08:17.869 --> 08:21.682
Dad, good luck! It's well known 
that of the cruelest grades,

08:21.783 --> 08:25.150
ninth is third, seventh is second, 
and fourth is first!

08:26.428 --> 08:30.204
If you're not going to order, 
I'll have to ask you to leave 
this establishment.

08:30.305 --> 08:33.900
Gert!  You working here?
-At Daphne's insistence.

08:34.373 --> 08:39.602
The blood is pooling in my feet, 
but at least I'm contributing 
to the palace's upkeep.

08:40.191 --> 08:43.500
Say, maybe I could sell some of 
that blood, and give my daughter 
her cut.

08:43.697 --> 08:47.200
Is that a good idea, Daphne?  
Should I sell my blood for you?

08:47.544 --> 08:50.978
No, Mum, you can keep your blood.
-Did you hear that everyone?

08:51.079 --> 08:54.100
My daughter's letting me keep 
my blood!

08:55.357 --> 08:59.322
Okay, that's nice. Maybe 
we'll go have coffee at home.

09:00.607 --> 09:03.307
No tips.  
Nice.

09:10.245 --> 09:14.967
Frasier.  Hi.  What a surprise.
Honey, guess who's here again!

09:17.851 --> 09:20.051
Whoa!  
Four times in one week.

09:20.500 --> 09:23.300
Hi, Chet.  How do you like 
the sconces, huh?

09:23.722 --> 09:27.100
Uh, good, good.  I thought 
you had plans tonight.

09:27.624 --> 09:30.962
Well, I was just driving by and 
I noticed something rather alarming.
-What is it?

09:31.063 --> 09:36.000
It seems somebody has put a... 
a cow mailbox at the end of 
your driveway.

09:36.627 --> 09:39.053
That's ours.  
Chet put it up this morning.

09:39.154 --> 09:43.079
If you want, we'd be happy to give 
you back the one you gave us.
-No, no, no, that's not necessary.

09:43.180 --> 09:46.280
It was a gift, and it was custom-
painted to match the shutters...

09:46.381 --> 09:49.675
exactly the way I pictured it 
when this house was no more 
than a foundation.

09:49.776 --> 09:54.858
Now the cow is... is beautiful, 
but is it really the first 
impression you want to make?

09:54.959 --> 09:58.182
Remember, a mailbox is a house's 
handshake.

09:59.489 --> 10:03.844
We like the cow. It's cute. 
-Besides, we're thinking about 
replacing the shutters.

10:03.945 --> 10:08.000
Maybe put up some awnings.
-And a screen door. 
Wouldn't that be cozy?

10:08.646 --> 10:11.576
Gosh, I'm sorry.  
Everything's going so fast.

10:12.377 --> 10:15.827
I, uh, last night when I drove away 
from here, it seemed like we were 
all on the same page.

10:15.928 --> 10:20.053
Now it feels like we're working at 
cross-purposes.  How do we feel 
about the accessories?

10:20.254 --> 10:24.000
They're okay. -Okay? Last night, 
they were "to die for"!

10:24.156 --> 10:28.150
That doesn't sound like something 
I'd say. -Well, I remember somebody 
saying it.

10:29.300 --> 10:33.710
Look, all right, let's, let's just 
try to calm down here.  Marge, 
why don't you go serve up

10:33.811 --> 10:36.846
some of that world-famous apple pie 
of yours. We can all sit down 
and work this out.

10:36.947 --> 10:40.470
Thanks, Dr. Crane, you've been a big 
help, but I think that we can take it 
from here.

10:40.571 --> 10:42.971
Well, but surely...
-Good night, Dr. Crane!

10:50.024 --> 10:53.040
Dad, this is crazy.  
If you're too sick 
to drive yourself here,

10:53.141 --> 10:55.995
you're too sick to give a safety talk.
-I'll be fine.

10:56.096 --> 11:00.684
I just have to get over this 
dizziness.
-There you are, Mr. Crane.

11:00.885 --> 11:03.871
I was getting nervous.
-Listen, my dad's not feeling well.

11:03.972 --> 11:07.410
I think it would be best 
if we canceled the assembly.
-Are you kidding?

11:07.511 --> 11:11.300
If we cancel this thing, we'll have 
a riot on our hands.  The teachers 
are expecting a free period.

11:12.618 --> 11:16.909
The kids are looking forward 
to seeing the safety show.
We aren't going to let them down.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.900
Okay, if you really think 
you can do this.
-I can.

11:24.180 --> 11:29.700
And by the way, you're just as 
beautiful today as you were the day 
I married you.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.678
Okay, I let that go the first time.  
Sit down.

11:33.779 --> 11:36.500
We're going to get him some ice 
water.  We're going to keep him 
off his feet.

11:36.701 --> 11:39.873
Okay, but you'll have to go on 
in his place. -Heh-heh.  
No, I can't do that.

11:39.974 --> 11:44.006
Yes, you can. Safety is everyone's 
concern.  And I can't guarantee yours

11:44.107 --> 11:46.007
if you don't.

11:50.832 --> 11:54.500
Quiet, quiet people, settle down.  
Gameboys off.

11:55.357 --> 11:59.770
Let's give a warm fourth-grade 
welcome to Officer Eddie and...

12:00.700 --> 12:02.200
...friend.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

12:12.123 --> 12:14.123
Hello, safety fans.

12:15.152 --> 12:19.600
I'm Citizen-Officer Niles, and 
this is my partner, Officer Eddie!

12:23.652 --> 12:27.374
Okay. Officer Eddie will now 
show us how to act

12:27.475 --> 12:30.008
in various dangerous situations.

12:30.209 --> 12:35.050
Say, Officer Eddie, can you show 
the kids what to do 
before they cross the street.

12:40.863 --> 12:43.463
That's right, 
we wait for the signal.

12:47.279 --> 12:50.600
Okay, uh, Eddie, show the boys and 
girls what to do if they're lost.

12:51.845 --> 12:54.045
Eddie?  
Come here boy, hey!

12:56.797 --> 13:00.403
Children, I have a confession 
to make. I'm not a Citizen-Officer.

13:01.004 --> 13:04.600
I'm a psychiatric doctor 
specializing in marriage 
and family counseling.

13:07.381 --> 13:09.381
I know, I know.  
The point is...

13:09.692 --> 13:14.500
...The point is that my father is 
an actual officer, and he'd be 
here today,

13:14.863 --> 13:19.700
except he got a nasty cold, 
probably from some careless youngsters 
at his last assembly

13:20.987 --> 13:24.850
Which brings up a different, 
yet no less important kind of safety:

13:25.586 --> 13:26.986
hygiene!

13:27.915 --> 13:33.459
Oh, geez. -I would like to introduce 
you to the first defense in the war 
against germs:

13:33.882 --> 13:36.482
Officer Pocket Square! 

13:38.225 --> 13:43.600
Okay, okay. Maybe it's not cool 
to carry a handkerchief around 
anymore.  -It's not!

13:44.582 --> 13:48.300
Is influenza cool?  
Is scarlet fever cool?

13:49.289 --> 13:52.700
Do you have any Idea how many germs 
there are on just one finger?

13:53.196 --> 13:55.696
Yes, that finger, for example!

13:59.435 --> 14:00.935
It's millions!

14:01.184 --> 14:04.855
Or take simple dust.  
Do you know what dust is?

14:04.956 --> 14:07.230
It's the excretion of mites!

14:07.331 --> 14:11.100
Little bugs that are eating your skin 
right now!

14:13.469 --> 14:17.200
What the hell is he doing?
-He's freaking me out, 
that's what he's doing.

14:21.417 --> 14:24.800
Oh, Roz, hey, come and join me.  
I'm in a bit of a pickle.

14:25.979 --> 14:29.400
I... I'm not sure the Grants are 
the right family for our house.

14:30.843 --> 14:34.050
Who? -The Grants. The people 
who moved into the house we built.

14:34.484 --> 14:38.151
You went back there? -Just a few times, 
yes, to try to share with them 
the principles 

14:38.352 --> 14:42.200
of decor, room flow, 
general livability.

14:42.586 --> 14:46.195
Then they literally showed me 
the door. Yes, Roz, the very door

14:46.296 --> 14:48.592
I hung for them 
in the first place.

14:48.793 --> 14:52.200
Take a moment to digest the irony.

14:53.618 --> 14:56.549
What do you expect, 
it's their house.

14:56.650 --> 15:01.250
Yes, but I helped to build it.
-Okay, untangling extension cords

15:01.351 --> 15:04.500
and stirring paint isn't exactly 
building a house.

15:05.747 --> 15:10.150
Oh, I know I didn't do much.  
The truth is I've never really 
been very handy.

15:10.811 --> 15:13.800
In elementary school, 
I made an ashtray for my dad.

15:14.931 --> 15:17.431
It caught fire.

15:18.132 --> 15:21.600
Frasier, you did your part, 
but now you have to let go.

15:22.228 --> 15:26.329
Poor family.  Probably think 
you're some rich arrogant guy

15:26.630 --> 15:28.937
who's bossing everyone around.
-Oh, Lord.

15:29.238 --> 15:32.364
Well, maybe I owe them an apology, 
Roz, I mean the last thing

15:32.465 --> 15:35.200
I want Marge and Chet to think of me 
is that I'm some sort of snob.

15:35.970 --> 15:39.350
Did I tell you they have 
a cow mailbox at the end 
of their driveway?

15:40.442 --> 15:44.700
My mom has a cow mailbox. 
-Well, sure, that's Wisconsin.

15:45.382 --> 15:48.182
The buckle on the bumpkin belt.

15:50.187 --> 15:52.187
Hey, you two.
-Oh, hi, Daph.

15:52.756 --> 15:55.251
A latte, please.
-Daphne!

15:55.585 --> 15:57.800
Here it is.  
My first paycheck.

15:58.094 --> 16:01.150
$74.12 post tax. 

16:01.421 --> 16:06.700
See, everybody!  I'm helping out 
my well-to-do daughter with 
my pittance of a paycheck.

16:06.966 --> 16:11.500
Thanks. -I suppose you're going 
to ask me to stop working here.

16:11.794 --> 16:15.654
Well, I don't care if you are 
embarrassed. I will contribute 
to the household

16:15.755 --> 16:19.900
like you told me, 
even if it kills me. 
-Sign here.

16:21.905 --> 16:25.500
Right, then. I'll just work here 
till I keel over dead.

16:26.077 --> 16:30.192
Kindly set aside a few pennies 
from my pay for a nice casket.

16:30.693 --> 16:32.993
Already taken care of.

16:37.264 --> 16:42.600
Four rodent hairs, and the head 
capsule of an adult grain beetle.

16:46.177 --> 16:50.336
Okay, I heard chocolate, 
I'll take chocolate.  
Per 100 grams,

16:50.500 --> 16:54.342
the government allows 
an average of approximately

16:54.643 --> 16:59.200
60 insect fragments 
and the odd rodent hair.

17:01.606 --> 17:05.400
But let's say you want 
to play it safe.  
Maybe drink a can of fruit juice.

17:05.913 --> 17:08.400
That's healthy... 
or is it?

17:10.163 --> 17:14.900
Well, sure... if your idea of 
healthy is approximately 
five fly eggs and a maggot!

17:16.050 --> 17:18.550
This is your government, people!

17:20.521 --> 17:24.000
All right, let's thank Dr. Crane 
for coming by today...

17:24.909 --> 17:27.300
...but I'm afraid 
we're out of time.

17:29.447 --> 17:33.700
Okay, okay, one more, 
and then we have to say goodbye.

17:36.225 --> 17:39.450
Well, I can't leave without 
mentioning our friend, the hot dog.

17:41.922 --> 17:45.800
Or perhaps it should be called 
"hot parasitic cysts,

17:46.743 --> 17:51.750
insect fragments, general grit, 
and rodent droppings."  Thank you.

17:57.313 --> 18:01.100
Thank you, Dr. Crane, 
for that most enlightening talk,

18:02.033 --> 18:04.133
and right before lunch.

18:04.894 --> 18:07.894
Everyone exit in a single line 
to the cafeteria, please.

18:10.813 --> 18:13.200
Good job, Niles!
-Thanks.

18:13.845 --> 18:17.750
It was touch and go there for 
a while, but you came through 
with flying colors.

18:18.418 --> 18:22.402
Hey, quick thinking making up 
that stuff about the hot dogs.
-Thanks, but I didn't make it up.

18:22.603 --> 18:25.553
I said it was okay to make up 
that stuff about the hot dogs,

18:25.654 --> 18:28.380
which I love 
and had for breakfast.

18:28.681 --> 18:31.600
Yes, well, I guess I was faster 
on my feet than I knew.

18:32.014 --> 18:33.914
Excuse me, sir.

18:34.766 --> 18:38.600
I just wanted to say, 
you were great up there. 
-Thank you.

18:41.777 --> 18:43.277
Hey, kid!

18:47.137 --> 18:48.737
Here.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.400
Wow!  
Thanks, Citizen-Officer Niles!

18:59.549 --> 19:03.600
Thanks for coming along with me, Roz. 
I'm not sure they'd open the door 
if it was just me.

19:07.951 --> 19:09.951
It's him again!

19:11.522 --> 19:15.850
I--I'm sorry to disturb you. 
You remember Roz.
-Hi!

19:16.292 --> 19:18.942
Hello.
-I... I just wanted to say

19:19.143 --> 19:22.533
how sorry I am for my behavior 
this last week.

19:22.668 --> 19:26.146
I've been intrusive and controlling.

19:26.247 --> 19:29.250
I lost sight of the fact 
that this is your home -

19:29.952 --> 19:33.750
to do with as you will, and 
I sincerely wish you all 

19:34.067 --> 19:36.600
many years of happiness in it.

19:38.170 --> 19:41.300
Thank you.
-You care to come in?

19:41.770 --> 19:45.200
Oh, we'd be honored to be guests 
in your home.

19:48.273 --> 19:51.789
Oh, look what you've done 
with the place!
-Do you like it?

19:51.890 --> 19:54.839
I think it's great.  
What do you think, Frasier?

19:55.240 --> 19:57.840
Would you like to take a tour?

19:59.868 --> 20:02.968
We just finished repainting 
the den yesterday.

20:04.520 --> 20:07.420
Oh, Frasier, you've got to see this.

20:09.068 --> 20:11.768
Oh?  Oh... wow, that's purple!

20:13.251 --> 20:16.353
Thank you again for the tour.  
Your home is lovely.

20:16.454 --> 20:19.707
We like it.
-It's the kind of home 
we've always dreamed of.

20:19.808 --> 20:22.308
Yes!
-Good night.

20:22.901 --> 20:24.401
Good night.

20:26.638 --> 20:29.800
Frasier, I am very proud of you. 
-I did it.

20:30.592 --> 20:33.243
I didn't criticize. 
I said nothing judgmental.

20:33.344 --> 20:36.900
I didn't say a single word about 
their horrible, horrible taste.

20:37.355 --> 20:41.120
You were great.
-I finally did it!

20:42.697 --> 20:45.500
This was the ultimate test 
and I passed!

20:46.200 --> 20:48.764
I can finally let go.

20:49.257 --> 20:51.257
Good-bye, house. 

20:52.106 --> 20:54.106
I release you.

20:59.122 --> 21:01.700
<i>They're going to call 
the police!</i>!
-Shut up!

21:03.312 --> 21:05.312
It's better this way!
