00:03.080 --> 00:05.180
Nikolai. William's brother.

00:05.400 --> 00:07.700
She's not my girlfriend,
and she's leaving now.

00:07.700 --> 00:10.840
I wonder how many girls William
will sleep with during Russetiden.

00:11.960 --> 00:16.360
You're going to be sleeping around.
-Then you know more than me.

00:16.420 --> 00:20.020
I won't hurt you.
And if you really want to meet my brother...

00:20.020 --> 00:22.020
... then I'll introduce you to him.

00:22.020 --> 00:26.900
I don't think it's you Isak has feelings for.

00:28.540 --> 00:33.680
Is that Chris and Isak?
Isn't that a little strange?

00:40.540 --> 00:44.120
My phone battery is...

00:45.620 --> 00:49.680
It's so bad.
-Yeah I know. Same with mine.

00:52.580 --> 00:59.180
The Riot Club? Isn't that a bit of a weak concept?
-I don't know.

01:00.040 --> 01:07.040
Russ concepts are not really my specialty.

01:09.580 --> 01:12.140
Looks like they had fun at
the release party.

01:16.660 --> 01:20.900
What are you looking at?
-Chris' instagram.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.840
I saw something strange yesterday.

01:33.780 --> 01:34.680
What?

01:36.860 --> 01:42.200
Isak and Penetrator Chris were together.

01:44.320 --> 01:48.280
What? Together how?

01:48.880 --> 01:55.760
No. Isak got into a car
with Penetrator Chris.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.180
Are you kidding?
-No!

01:59.340 --> 02:04.640
Where was that?
-On the right side of school.

02:10.120 --> 02:15.340
Imagine if they're in a relationship!
How crazy would that be?

02:15.580 --> 02:21.740
Yeah but you don't have to be in a relationship
if you sit in a car together.

02:24.400 --> 02:30.100
It's still a bit weird, you know?
-Because it seemed like they were trying to hide it.

02:30.260 --> 02:34.240
Hide what?
-Nothing.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.300
Say it!

02:37.340 --> 02:40.920
Hey, tell me Noora.
Hide what?

02:44.440 --> 02:47.120
Huh?
-Nothing!

02:48.360 --> 02:52.940
Did you tell Eskild about Isak?
-No.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.740
Who is Isak?
-No one.

02:54.740 --> 02:58.420
Eva, don't start.

02:58.420 --> 03:02.940
Don't say anything to Eskild. You don't
know what he's capable of.

03:03.260 --> 03:05.960
Eva. Eskild

03:06.400 --> 03:08.420
Friends!
She's just pissed.

03:08.640 --> 03:12.040
Don't try to come between us.
It's jealousy.

03:13.560 --> 03:18.020
Eva, say it to Eskild.
Cutie!

03:20.980 --> 03:23.460
I can't hold it in!

03:23.940 --> 03:27.100
Okay, we have a friend
who we think is gay.

03:27.780 --> 03:28.640
Who is it?

03:28.960 --> 03:30.080
Isak.

03:30.260 --> 03:35.680
He's always together with a lot of girls
but we found gay porn on his phone.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.960
Eh... he's gay!

03:38.100 --> 03:42.360
Excuse me, you think that everyone's gay Eskild.

03:42.360 --> 03:45.160
I do not.
-You do!

03:45.580 --> 03:47.860
Let me see pictures of him.
Give me some visuals.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.540
I'll find one.

03:51.520 --> 03:52.820
Okay, look at this.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.880
Isakyaki? Okay.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.900
Yeah, he's gay. I chatted with him
on Grindr last week.

04:03.760 --> 04:04.760
Seriously?

04:06.700 --> 04:09.720
I'm messing. He looks sweet though.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.280
Pouty, handsome.

04:14.460 --> 04:15.500
So nice that he's gay!

04:15.800 --> 04:18.500
He isn't gay.
You don't know...

04:18.680 --> 04:22.000
We don't even know if he is.

04:24.260 --> 04:25.760
I'm gonna find out.

04:26.460 --> 04:27.960
Eskild!

04:29.160 --> 04:33.960
You won't find out anything.
You're not a part of this.

04:33.960 --> 04:38.740
I can chat with him if I want to.
You don't own Instagram. Jesus!

04:42.560 --> 04:45.280
Do you know what you've started, huh?

05:22.900 --> 05:26.040
I have to hurry...
for English.

05:27.540 --> 05:29.000
Can't have more absences.

05:31.420 --> 05:32.820
Hurry then.

05:37.180 --> 05:39.580
See you after school?

05:40.760 --> 05:44.460
Tomorrow. I have bus stuff tonight.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.380
Maybe I can stay at your place.

05:50.920 --> 05:51.780
Okay.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.560
What is it?
-I can't leave now.

06:05.720 --> 06:08.640
I have a hard-on,
so we have to stand here for a bit.

06:12.740 --> 06:14.400
Don't be delicious.

06:16.800 --> 06:23.000
It's physically impossible for me
to not be delicious, so..

06:23.000 --> 06:23.940
True.

06:24.860 --> 06:26.680
Say something that will turn me off.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.980
When will I meet your brother?

06:38.500 --> 06:39.660
Before the weekend, maybe.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.780
I got a message from Vilde.

06:49.980 --> 06:54.820
She was wondering if you guys could
party on our bus with us on Friday.

06:55.020 --> 06:56.420
Are you keen?

06:58.140 --> 06:59.080
No.

07:00.180 --> 07:01.240
Why not?

07:02.220 --> 07:05.820
William, I can't be on that bus
with you and Vilde.

07:08.740 --> 07:11.840
Well okay. I have to go.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.660
Don't touch me.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.480
I heard you can get
chlamydia in your eye.

07:30.020 --> 07:34.600
I don't want to..
-Oh, I get it.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.600
I don't want to have
chlamydia in my mouth.

07:40.180 --> 07:44.900
Tell me if you get it,
so we don't spread it.

07:45.080 --> 07:49.060
Maybe we have it in our mouths.
-You think so?

07:49.060 --> 07:51.240
I don't know. From Jonas?

07:51.240 --> 07:52.180
Hello!

08:00.540 --> 08:01.840
What is it?

08:08.320 --> 08:13.440
Your lipstick is just a bit smudgy.

08:14.680 --> 08:17.680
Oh yeah. I just ate, so..

08:21.720 --> 08:26.620
Ate? Ate what? Dick?

08:38.940 --> 08:43.720
Vilde has arranged that we can party on
the Penetrators bus on Friday.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.160
The Riot Club.
-To me they'll always be the Penetrators.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.500
We were talking about
who we want to hook up with.

08:51.260 --> 08:53.120
Who do you want to hook up with?

08:55.200 --> 08:58.360
Eh, no one.
-No...

09:02.000 --> 09:06.360
Noora, it just so happens that we get
to go on the bus.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.420
The situation there is a little different.
It's give and take.

09:09.420 --> 09:12.460
<i>[Now Vilde's saying that we're partying
with you guys. You have to stop it.]</i>
The situation there is a little different.
It's give and take.

09:12.460 --> 09:14.260
<i>[Now Vilde's saying that we're partying

09:14.260 --> 09:16.260
We have to give something back.

09:18.480 --> 09:22.320
Vilde, that's the dumbest
thing I've heard.

09:23.040 --> 09:26.420
There's no need to hook up with anyone.
I don't have to...

09:32.060 --> 09:37.840
What about Julian? He's kind of your
type. He's the sweetest.

09:38.020 --> 09:40.620
A little bit... feminine?

09:42.420 --> 09:44.800
What are you talking
about now, Vilde?

09:47.060 --> 09:53.760
I'll fix it. You, Noora Amalie SaÃ¦tre,
will get hook a up.

09:54.780 --> 09:57.460
No, Vilde!
-I'll fix it, okay?

10:13.600 --> 10:16.280
Yeah, so this is my room.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.960
This is your room?
-Yeah.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.280
Nice.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.520
Thanks.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.980
Remember when you said you
wouldn't have sex before you got married?

11:11.540 --> 11:14.500
Eh, yes. I remember that.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.360
That was really funny.

11:26.440 --> 11:30.160
Yeah, but it wasn't a joke.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.100
No...

11:37.380 --> 11:39.000
No.
-No.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.740
Yeah, same for me.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.600
I think it's cool to wait.

11:57.340 --> 11:58.520
Do you mean that?

11:59.340 --> 11:59.960
No.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.640
Okay...

12:09.820 --> 12:16.660
Eskild! You can't just come into my
room whenever it suits you.

12:18.840 --> 12:19.620
Who's that?

12:23.780 --> 12:29.860
William. Eskild.
Eskild, William.

12:30.420 --> 12:32.640
William, Eskild.
-I see.

12:35.260 --> 12:36.780
What do you want?

12:38.020 --> 12:40.600
I was chatting to that Isak guy.
He's not gay.

12:41.800 --> 12:42.880
Eskild!

12:44.760 --> 12:45.500
What?

12:50.860 --> 12:53.700
Is it a secret that he
isn't gay, or what?

12:54.300 --> 12:55.000
Fucking hell.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.220
She's so uptight.
Can you do something about it?

12:59.140 --> 13:00.640
Believe me, I'm trying.

13:01.300 --> 13:02.940
You need dick, Noora. Dick.

13:03.620 --> 13:04.840
Eskild!

13:13.440 --> 13:17.360
<i>[Now I know who you can hook up with.
Maksin! He's so handsome!]</i>

13:18.400 --> 13:20.800
Hey you.

13:21.320 --> 13:28.280
Vilde still thinks that we're going
to party on your bus.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.540
And... you have to stop it.

13:31.680 --> 13:35.000
Yeah but the guys are excited about partying
with a Muslim, so it's still on.

13:37.460 --> 13:38.620
Sana?

13:39.460 --> 13:40.320
Yes.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.220
Why?

13:43.960 --> 13:45.320
Why not?

13:49.140 --> 13:56.780
Okay, but you know I can't be on
that bus with you and Vilde.

13:57.900 --> 14:01.240
We know this isn't going
to go well.

14:03.980 --> 14:05.280
Then you'll stay home.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.240
<i>[I know I promised you'd meet Nico, but he's gone back
to Stockholm. You'll meet him in the summer.]</i>

14:32.240 --> 14:33.980
So what exactly did Eskild say?
<i>[I know I promised you'd meet Nico, but he's gone back
to Stockholm. You'll meet him in the summer.]</i>

14:33.980 --> 14:35.360
<i>[I know I promised you'd meet Nico, but he's gone back
to Stockholm. You'll meet him in the summer.]</i>

14:35.460 --> 14:41.540
He just said that he chatted with him,
and that he really wasn't gay.

14:43.240 --> 14:46.320
How does he know he's gay or not?

14:47.980 --> 14:51.900
I don't know. They have their
own language or something?

14:52.640 --> 14:55.460
Did you ask what they talked about?

14:55.900 --> 14:57.240
Eh, no.

14:57.240 --> 15:04.820
I was just relieved that Eskild wasn't convinced,
or he would have started stalking him.

15:06.900 --> 15:07.820
There's Chris.

15:11.560 --> 15:15.000
Oh my god. They're gonna
talk in secret characters.

15:19.560 --> 15:20.900
Did you see that?

15:23.680 --> 15:24.860
Eh, yes!

15:27.140 --> 15:29.580
That was the call-me sign!

15:29.940 --> 15:33.520
That was such an obvious sign!

15:34.360 --> 15:35.740
They're in a relationship.

15:38.780 --> 15:43.620
It's not certain that they are.
-It is! What else?

15:45.760 --> 15:46.640
You know what?

15:48.860 --> 15:52.960
I will try to hook up with Chris
in the bus on Friday.

15:54.400 --> 15:59.520
If he doesn't want to hook up with me,
then I'm convinced.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.740
That's the plan.

17:50.780 --> 17:56.480
Noora, this here is Julian.
He has been in Madrid.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.980
She's a virgin.
Virgin!

18:04.740 --> 18:06.460
Hi. Noora.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.700
So you've been in Madrid, huh?
-Yeah.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.380
Noora! Do you know what happened?

19:11.480 --> 19:17.300
I hooked up with Chris, and his
phone started ringing.

19:17.580 --> 19:21.960
"Isak calling" is what it said on the display.

19:21.960 --> 19:26.460
So then he just pulled away.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.840
Fucking hell, really!

20:27.240 --> 20:28.580
What's going on?

20:29.540 --> 20:30.540
Just stay here.

20:32.300 --> 20:33.060
Okay?

20:34.600 --> 20:35.420
Okay...

20:36.220 --> 20:37.260
You promise?

20:38.960 --> 20:41.500
What are you going to do?

20:43.800 --> 20:44.780
Just stay here.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.140
What's going on?

20:52.100 --> 20:55.000
We have to stay here.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.700
It's the Yakuza guys.
