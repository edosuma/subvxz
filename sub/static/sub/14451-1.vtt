Jeff work.

02:30.617 --> 02:32.151
How can I complain?

02:34.020 --> 02:40.025
Women in Darfur, you know, walk 14 miles to get water,

02:40.027 --> 02:41.960
raped on the way.

02:41.962 --> 02:44.196
And on their way home, just trying to get water back to

02:44.198 --> 02:47.366
the family, raped again, spill all the water, have to go

02:47.368 --> 02:48.800
back, probably raped a third time.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.469
I mean, how dare I?

02:50.471 --> 02:53.305
How dare any of us?

02:53.307 --> 02:55.707
Rachel, do I need to remind you how much time you spend

02:55.709 --> 02:58.143
giving back?

02:58.145 --> 03:00.412
You know
what, if it's gluten-free and

03:00.414 --> 03:02.080
it is the same, how could it hurt?

03:02.082 --> 03:05.250
Eastside JCC Moms!

03:05.252 --> 03:06.652
What are we doing?

03:06.654 --> 03:09.254
Packing lunch for the homeless!

03:09.256 --> 03:11.056
OK, I'm gonna post this.

03:11.058 --> 03:13.258
When you get home, be sure to like it.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.126
OK?

03:14.128 --> 03:16.295
You have to share it with everybody.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.496
Get your friends to like it.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.398
I'm gonna see you guys at the auction?

03:19.400 --> 03:21.967
Rachel, I'm talking to you.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.969
Yep, got it.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.738
I know, it takes a lot of time.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.340
And how are things with Logan?

03:28.342 --> 03:29.608
Is he good?

03:29.610 --> 03:30.509
Oh, Logan is awesome.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.977
Are you two playing?

03:31.979 --> 03:34.079
I know you said you were having trouble getting on the

03:34.081 --> 03:36.915
floor with him and just playing.

03:36.917 --> 03:41.386
So fun just to get on the floor and just play with him.

03:45.525 --> 03:47.559
And how's Jeff?

03:47.561 --> 03:49.995
Yeah, all's well.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.197
Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.865
Good, good.

03:57.737 --> 04:00.205
Rachel, you don't have to tell me the truth, but,

04:00.207 --> 04:02.140
uh, it is your time.

04:02.142 --> 04:03.475
You pay for it.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.014
Still no sex.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.182
Lost count.

04:10.184 --> 04:12.050
Six months.

04:12.052 --> 04:15.454
I feel like there's a lot of couples that probably go

04:15.456 --> 04:16.654
through dry spells-

04:16.656 --> 04:18.223
-Not healthy couples, no.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.206
Instead of just, like, talking about the

04:34.208 --> 04:37.542
fact that we're not having sex, we use this code.

04:37.544 --> 04:41.213
He asks if he should put the dog out.

04:41.215 --> 04:42.414
Hey baby.

04:43.484 --> 04:44.249
I gotta sleep.

04:44.251 --> 04:45.584
Yeah, I know.

04:45.586 --> 04:48.520
I was just, uh, thinking of putting Bonnet out.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.921
-Um--

04:49.923 --> 04:53.358
-Or you know, I could just let him stay in here.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.327
If you don't want me to.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.461
It doesn't matter.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.263
It doesn't matter to me either.

04:58.265 --> 05:03.468
Well, let him stay.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.102
You sure?

05:04.104 --> 05:05.170
Yeah?

05:05.172 --> 05:07.272
Yeah.

05:07.274 --> 05:08.707
OK.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.509
Are you avoiding intercourse?

05:10.511 --> 05:11.677
Bedtime?

05:11.679 --> 05:14.246
That is the worst time to have sex.

05:14.248 --> 05:16.815
Is there a time you'd prefer?

05:16.817 --> 05:24.323
Oh, like a 3:30, or 4:00
tea time thing.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.158
You know?

05:26.160 --> 05:28.527
Elicit.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.862
Curtains closed, sun trying to get in.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.435
We meet somewhere.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.671
May I share something with you?

05:39.673 --> 05:44.710
When Portia and I met in
1979 at Smith College--

05:44.712 --> 05:45.711
Does your shrink tell

05:45.713 --> 05:47.779
you about her life?

05:47.781 --> 05:49.948
No, because if she did, I would fire her.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.284
It goes against her, like, Hippocratic Oath or something.

05:52.286 --> 05:54.519
- Oh my god, Lenore is always
talking about her awful--

05:54.521 --> 05:55.954
-Ugh, Lenore.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.190
--Lesbian partner Portia and how deep their love is.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.391
Please fire Lenore.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.926
Ugh.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.095
I bet they have eyes open orgasms.

06:03.097 --> 06:06.298
Looking into the eyes of
your partner when he--

06:08.369 --> 06:09.968
No thank you.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.337
Oh god, I'm so ready just to
say fuck you to that auction.

06:12.339 --> 06:13.772
I just do not wanna go.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.240
Oh my god, me neither.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.242
I'm buying a parking space for my horrible wife.

06:17.244 --> 06:20.779
No, I'm buying the parking space for my horrible wife.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.147
Ugh.

06:22.149 --> 06:23.615
Oh, gentleman's club.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.917
Oh, well, yes, of course, because they are the most

06:25.919 --> 06:30.589
Their little nut sack peeking out, and their tiny little

06:30.591 --> 06:31.990
monocles.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.425
Top of the morning to you, ladies.

06:33.427 --> 06:36.628
Would you mind if I jacked myself off?

06:36.630 --> 06:38.230
You ever been to a strip club?

06:38.232 --> 06:39.698
Seriously?

06:39.700 --> 06:40.665
Bo and I have gone to, like, a million strip clubs.

06:40.667 --> 06:41.466
Are you serious?

06:41.468 --> 06:43.001
Yes.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.503
We go there, we get all hot, and
then we bang the shit out

06:44.505 --> 06:45.837
of each other when we get home.

06:45.839 --> 06:46.738
Should I make a res?

06:46.740 --> 06:49.941
What's wrong with you?

06:49.943 --> 06:51.309
Let me guess.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.911
This was Steph's idea.

06:52.913 --> 06:56.481
No, actually, it was my idea.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.417
I've never done anything like this before.

06:58.419 --> 06:59.551
It'll be hilarious.

06:59.553 --> 07:00.685
You've never been to a strip club?

07:00.687 --> 07:02.287
No.

07:02.289 --> 07:05.023
Strip clubs are sad, and they
make me the opposite of horny.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.691
They make me angry.

07:06.693 --> 07:11.496
You don't think that looking at young, hot American tits

07:11.498 --> 07:13.465
are gonna get you horny?

07:13.467 --> 07:15.567
How do you know their American?

07:15.569 --> 07:16.334
-They could be--

07:16.336 --> 07:17.969
I don't know.

07:17.971 --> 07:21.006
You're not gonna know what hits you when you get home.

07:21.008 --> 07:23.375
It's gonna be sexual.

07:23.377 --> 07:27.245
It's gonna be oh so sexual.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.213
Mm.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.450
I'm gonna eat you alive.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.617
I'm might--

07:32.619 --> 07:35.020
I might even suck it right off.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.388
You don't know.

07:36.390 --> 07:37.722
I do not know.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.858
It's gonna be good.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.427
- I'm gonna make some hot loving
to your-- to your dad

07:42.429 --> 07:43.128
bod.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.029
Oh, man.

07:44.031 --> 07:48.900
I wanted to bid on the Cuperbergs' condo in Maui and

07:48.902 --> 07:50.702
now I can't.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.404
Jeff, you don't wanna stay at that condo.

07:52.406 --> 07:53.905
It sounds repulsing.

07:53.907 --> 07:54.573
Yeah I do.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.907
It's in Maui.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.375
You can't even see the ocean from that condo.

07:57.377 --> 07:58.543
Why would we stay there?

07:58.545 --> 08:00.779
Jesus, Rachel, put on some clothes.

08:00.781 --> 08:04.049
Men wear those on their faces when they rob banks.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.451
You press that panic button, I'm gonna

08:06.453 --> 08:07.953
shoot you in the face.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.454
Bing, bing.

08:12.058 --> 08:14.793
Did you tell the babysitter what Logan likes for dinner?

08:14.795 --> 08:19.965
All right, I'm gonna see if we
have any of that frozen soy

08:19.967 --> 08:21.299
cheese pizza.

08:27.406 --> 08:28.373
IDs, please.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.374
Hi.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.509
Are you serious?

08:30.511 --> 08:32.376
I can't tell with y'all nowadays.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.111
You know?

08:33.113 --> 08:35.480
Best night of my life.

08:38.717 --> 08:40.684
Oh my god, thank you.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.287
Here you go.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.455
Thank you.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.257
Making my day.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.359
Larissa.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.896
Let's give it up for Larissa.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.431
Come on up.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.082
How old are you?

10:17.084 --> 10:18.483
I'm 19.

10:18.485 --> 10:21.052
Oh my god, that's young.

10:38.437 --> 10:41.006
I had a baby.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.741
That's OK.

11:29.655 --> 11:30.855
Hey baby.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.992
I'm gonna put Bonnet out, OK?

11:33.994 --> 11:35.360
OK.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.194
No, of course we should.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.164
That's why we're--

11:39.166 --> 11:40.231
Hold on a minute.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.099
Wha?

11:41.101 --> 11:42.200
What are you doing?

11:56.683 --> 11:58.483
I am so sorry!

11:58.485 --> 11:59.751
That's OK.

11:59.753 --> 12:00.518
Honey, I'm so sorry.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.886
It's OK.

12:01.888 --> 12:02.921
I know this was the night.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.055
It's OK.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.958
Did you do it to each other last night, or what?

12:06.960 --> 12:08.593
I was puking and Jeff was tired.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.562
Oh my god, you are gay and Jeff was gay.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.696
OK, he might've tried to shove it in there.

12:11.698 --> 12:12.964
I couldn't tell you.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.033
Does Bo ever just fold it and mush it in?

12:15.035 --> 12:17.068
Oh my god, like a soft response?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.436
Just sneak it in there?

12:18.438 --> 12:19.971
Oh god, Jennie.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.005
Hey.

12:21.007 --> 12:25.210
Oh, I'm so sorry, my sister had a thing.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.277
Yeah, mine did too.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.212
So weird.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.113
Hey you.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.181
Matt bought me the parking space.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.350
Of course he did.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.251
Oh.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.319
Yeah, I'll do it.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.019
I do.

12:35.021 --> 12:36.688
Wait, where are you going?

12:36.690 --> 12:37.856
I booked a massage.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.137
Previous destination.

12:55.509 --> 12:58.076
Sam's Hofbrau.

13:58.871 --> 14:02.507
Uh, just one Americano, please.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.474
What's your name?

14:03.476 --> 14:08.012
Um, Sophia.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.981
Keep the change.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.316
Thank you.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.990
Sophia?

14:18.992 --> 14:20.525
Thank you.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.198
Oh, hi.

14:30.736 --> 14:33.738
Do I look familiar to you?

14:33.740 --> 14:39.277
You gave me a lap dance last weekend.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.846
Yeah, I remember.

14:41.848 --> 14:44.249
Yeah, you came in with your husband, right?

14:44.251 --> 14:45.216
Yeah.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.150
That's cool, I like that.

14:46.152 --> 14:48.753
Yeah, you guys live downtown?

14:48.755 --> 14:50.955
No, I like in Silver Lake.

14:50.957 --> 14:51.856
Awesome.

14:51.858 --> 14:52.857
Yeah.

14:52.859 --> 14:55.493
Um, I follow this truck on Twitter, which is how I

14:55.495 --> 14:58.463
happened to find this truck today.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.098
Because they tweet.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.967
Yeah they do.

15:02.969 --> 15:06.971
Just my nom de coffee, if you will.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.306
Oh.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.208
I'm Rachel.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.109
I'm McKenna.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.410
It's nice to meet you.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.945
- When I got out of
college, I, uh--

15:13.947 --> 15:16.814
I majored in journalism, but I kinda couldn't get my shit

15:16.816 --> 15:19.918
together, so I ended up working at this PR firm

15:19.920 --> 15:22.620
writing press releases about Calista Flockhart's buttery

15:22.622 --> 15:24.956
choc highlights.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.759
Guys, who wants to try the new bar method place with me?

15:27.761 --> 15:28.526
Oh, is that open?

15:28.528 --> 15:29.594
Yeah, me I do.

15:29.596 --> 15:30.495
I got a Groupon.

15:30.497 --> 15:31.229
Let's use it.

15:31.231 --> 15:31.863
Uh, I can.

15:31.865 --> 15:33.298
What are you doing?

15:33.300 --> 15:34.699
Uh, oil change.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.100
So you know when you text somebody an emoticon?

15:36.102 --> 15:40.571
- So, this is just like that,
except you're-- you're texting

15:40.573 --> 15:42.740
a tiny picture of your face.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.208
It's called an e-me-ticon.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.176
-E-me-ticon.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.277
Yeah, I just bought that.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.912
Oh, that was Jeff.

15:47.914 --> 15:50.214
He's been trying to get something to hit.

15:50.216 --> 15:53.184
And now he's never not working, and I'm, you know,

15:53.186 --> 15:54.819
just online.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.922
I had this one picture of him growing up.

15:57.924 --> 16:00.091
He was in this weird maroon sweatshirt and

16:00.093 --> 16:02.961
had these crazy sideburns.

16:02.963 --> 16:06.064
My mom told me that he had a genius IQ, so that's why she

16:06.066 --> 16:08.232
picked him, because it was good genes.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.268
But then one night, she got really drunk and she told me

16:10.270 --> 16:12.203
that was actually just a random photo and she had no

16:12.205 --> 16:14.505
idea who got her pregnant.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.075
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.609
You know, it's--

16:18.611 --> 16:20.878
He's like a mystery to me.

16:20.880 --> 16:25.550
I get to imagine what he's like.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.318
I think he's like Axl Rose.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.620
Oh my god.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.888
You just snorted.

16:30.890 --> 16:34.425
Yeah, it's not cute in any way.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.493
It's so cute.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.061
No, way too old for the snort.

16:37.063 --> 16:39.397
No, it's cute.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.632
You know what?

16:41.634 --> 16:43.935
I will have a cigarette.

16:43.937 --> 16:46.170
OK.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.505
Why not?

16:56.148 --> 16:57.482
My lighter.

17:00.452 --> 17:02.053
Went out.

17:02.055 --> 17:03.388
Come here.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.157
Ready?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.358
Yeah.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.328
Oh, put your hand up.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.863
Yeah.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.477
I remember why people do this.

17:34.319 --> 17:35.319
Sophia?

17:35.321 --> 17:36.854
Yeah.

17:50.303 --> 17:50.935
Hey!

17:50.937 --> 17:51.903
Wait!

17:51.905 --> 17:53.137
McKenna!

17:53.139 --> 17:54.906
Are you OK?

17:54.908 --> 17:56.174
Sorry.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.108
Help me?

17:57.110 --> 17:58.076
Yes.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.777
Just fucking wait.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.180
This guy won't listen to me.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.015
Do you have a key?

18:04.017 --> 18:06.751
My entire life is in this car.

18:06.753 --> 18:07.952
That's my car, man!

18:07.954 --> 18:08.719
Hey, hey!

18:08.721 --> 18:09.488
What the fuck, McKenna?

18:09.489 --> 18:10.288
What happened?

18:10.290 --> 18:11.255
Look, Walter.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.723
Hey.

18:12.725 --> 18:14.225
There's apparently 35 fucking tickets on this thing!

18:14.227 --> 18:15.293
Wait.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.427
I could've been arrested, man.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.528
No, there was 10 tickets, tops.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.229
Asshole!

18:18.231 --> 18:18.963
No, hey!

18:18.965 --> 18:20.364
No!

18:20.366 --> 18:21.466
Hey, hey, hey, hey, my man!

18:21.468 --> 18:22.433
Yo, yo don't!

18:22.435 --> 18:23.835
No, don't.

18:23.837 --> 18:24.769
Fuck!

18:24.771 --> 18:25.436
God!

18:25.438 --> 18:26.370
You dumb bitch!

18:26.372 --> 18:27.004
Did you get your stuff?

18:27.006 --> 18:28.005
Yeah.

18:28.007 --> 18:28.673
Sir.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.041
Sir, excuse me.

18:30.043 --> 18:33.811
With all due respect, if the car had tickets on it, and

18:33.813 --> 18:35.580
it's your car, then I feel you're the responsible one.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.280
Who the fuck are you?

18:36.282 --> 18:37.181
Hey.

18:37.183 --> 18:38.549
That's my aunt Sophia.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.118
So be cool, man.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.920
What the fuck are you gonna do with all your shit?

18:42.922 --> 18:44.222
OK, OK.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.156
Just walk away.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.457
We get it.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.725
We get it.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.727
Don't fucking move.

18:58.203 --> 18:59.403
So.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.105
So you just put your
stuff, um--

19:01.107 --> 19:03.307
This is where you're going to be staying.

19:03.309 --> 19:06.911
First floor there's
a bed where we--

19:06.913 --> 19:09.147
Used to be the maid's room, but we don't

19:09.149 --> 19:09.981
have--

19:09.983 --> 19:12.550
Yeah, welcome, welcome.

19:12.552 --> 19:16.420
Make yourself at home.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.356
Oh, wow.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.124
Hey.

19:20.126 --> 19:23.027
Who is this guy?

19:23.029 --> 19:23.928
Hey, buddy.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.129
That's Bonnet.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.964
Hi cutie fruity patootie.

19:26.966 --> 19:30.701
That is the best name ever for a pup.

19:30.703 --> 19:31.669
-Let me show you--

19:31.671 --> 19:32.904
Let me show you your digs.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.005
Oh man.

19:34.007 --> 19:38.976
Let's get some fresh air in this room!

19:38.978 --> 19:41.546
Oh.

19:41.548 --> 19:44.115
Sorry.

19:44.117 --> 19:48.119
Yeah, this used to be our live in's room.

19:48.121 --> 19:52.623
I know it's stupid to think that we'd need a housekeeper.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.758
I don't even have a job.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.727
But, you know, she was a godsend.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.864
Because when I got pregnant with Logan, you know, I

19:59.866 --> 20:01.332
thought, I'm not gonna have a baby nurse.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.500
I'm not gonna need any of that.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.868
You know, I'm gonna-
I'm a mother.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.836
My body is built for this.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.505
And then came home, milk didn't come in.

20:07.507 --> 20:11.442
Tried and tried to nurse, couldn't latch on.

20:11.444 --> 20:14.245
Apparently my nipples are too small.

20:14.247 --> 20:17.615
So, he wouldn't stop crying for anybody except for Luce.

20:17.617 --> 20:22.153
And she's just so calm
that she just--

20:22.155 --> 20:23.854
Ugh.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.791
When Logan got into school, we
had to let her go, you know?

20:26.793 --> 20:29.327
And then we maybe thought for a minute we were gonna have

20:29.329 --> 20:32.463
another kid, and then we-- or it
was gonna be an office for

20:32.465 --> 20:33.331
me, or--

20:33.333 --> 20:34.732
-I like this color.

20:34.734 --> 20:38.202
This room would look really good in this color.

20:38.204 --> 20:41.105
Do you ice skate?

20:41.107 --> 20:41.839
Oh, these?

20:41.841 --> 20:43.541
Well, you know.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.876
For a hot New York minute.

20:45.878 --> 20:46.510
Got my--

20:46.512 --> 20:49.046
My skate on.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.282
My mom always told me that I should surround myself with

20:51.284 --> 20:53.284
good people if I want good things to happen.

20:56.321 --> 20:59.190
I'm 55 days sober, so good people are really important.

20:59.192 --> 21:00.424
Oh my god.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.260
McKenna, that's amazing.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.527
Congratulations.

21:03.529 --> 21:04.729
Wow.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.498
My mom's a witch.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.166
The Wiccan kind of witch, you know?

21:11.703 --> 21:13.904
Sometimes I think I might be one too.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.876
Is that my bathroom?

21:18.878 --> 21:20.278
D-d--

21:20.280 --> 21:22.947
Do you need clean towels?

21:22.949 --> 21:24.282
We have company.

21:28.053 --> 21:29.153
Go, go, go, go, go.

21:29.155 --> 21:30.254
I'm listening.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.023
We have company.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.391
Who's here?

21:33.393 --> 21:36.861
Have you ever heard of the Espresso Yourself truck?

21:36.863 --> 21:41.732
The coffee they make, Jeff, is like you cannot believe.

21:41.734 --> 21:44.035
You know when people just make one thing right?

21:44.037 --> 21:45.469
It's great.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.837
It's obsession worthy.

21:46.839 --> 21:47.638
OK.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.906
-So, I started--

21:48.908 --> 21:49.940
I started to follow the truck on Twitter.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.542
I thought you hated Twitter.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.210
I don't hate Twitter, Jeff.

21:53.212 --> 21:54.545
I'm not--

21:56.515 --> 21:58.215
I lurk on Twitter.

21:58.217 --> 21:59.083
You're a lurker.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.718
Just not a Tweeter.

22:00.720 --> 22:03.554
So, a few weeks ago, the truck
was parked right across the

22:03.556 --> 22:04.822
street from Sam's.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.357
Wait, let me get you--

22:06.359 --> 22:07.024
Let me get you some--

22:07.026 --> 22:08.959
-Sam who?

22:08.961 --> 22:10.194
Uh, Hofbrau.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.662
Sam's Hofbrau.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.664
That was the strip bar, or like, you know, topless place

22:13.666 --> 22:15.800
or whatever that we went to.

22:15.802 --> 22:17.435
Oh, you need cutlery.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.437
Anyway--

22:19.439 --> 22:22.373
who would've thunk it--
ran into McKenna.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.275
I don't know who McKenna is.

22:24.277 --> 22:26.610
-Oh, she, um--

22:26.612 --> 22:28.179
She's the dancer that--

22:28.181 --> 22:32.283
She's the dancer that gave me that private thingy when we

22:32.285 --> 22:33.184
were there.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.618
You mean the stripper?

22:34.620 --> 22:36.721
OK, sure.

22:36.723 --> 22:39.557
The stripper, is in the maid's room.

22:39.559 --> 22:42.026
The stripper's in the maid's room.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.794
Yeah.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.564
How did the stripper get in the maid's room?

22:46.566 --> 22:49.233
I put her there.

22:49.235 --> 22:52.069
So, I kept going back to the Espresso Yourself truck, and

22:52.071 --> 22:55.439
every time I would go there, I kept running into McKenna.

22:55.441 --> 22:57.775
So we just started talking.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.511
Anyway, she was, like, between apartments, her car was

23:00.513 --> 23:01.946
getting towed.

23:01.948 --> 23:04.148
She had nowhere to stay tonight, and you know all the

23:04.150 --> 23:07.318
work that I do for the homeless at the J, and, you

23:07.320 --> 23:08.953
know, I thought, here's--

23:08.955 --> 23:11.956
OK, Here's actual homelessness right in front of me.

23:11.958 --> 23:16.193
So you invited her to stay here in our

23:16.195 --> 23:18.562
house with our child?

23:18.564 --> 23:20.498
-Just for like a-- two nights.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.466
Like, one night maybe.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.869
You won't even notice she's here, Jeff.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.070
I don't wanna

23:26.072 --> 23:26.837
meet her right now.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.038
I think we should just--

23:28.040 --> 23:29.373
-Shut up.

23:35.380 --> 23:37.381
Just a few days.

23:37.383 --> 23:39.483
OK, we gotta keep quiet.

23:44.322 --> 23:46.056
I love you.

23:51.296 --> 23:53.364
Morning.

23:53.366 --> 23:54.832
Uh, hey.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.635
Hey.

23:57.637 --> 23:58.936
I remember you.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.138
You guys were, like, the cutest couple ever.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.540
Oh, thank you.

24:02.542 --> 24:03.641
We work at it.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.109
Actually, we don't.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.244
Do you want some coffee?

24:07.246 --> 24:09.246
Um, do you have tea?

24:09.248 --> 24:10.781
Yeah.

24:13.985 --> 24:16.821
Oh, wow, look at this, a tea box.

24:16.823 --> 24:20.958
- We're sort of-- sort of
hooked up that way.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.227
Yeah.

24:23.229 --> 24:26.063
I'll take a chai spice.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.165
Yeah, why not?

24:28.167 --> 24:30.167
I have to say, that was, like, the best sleep I've had in

24:30.169 --> 24:31.335
five years.

24:31.337 --> 24:32.236
Not joking.

24:32.238 --> 24:33.804
Hollywood is so noisy.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.640
Yeah, sometimes I find the birds in this neighborhood can

24:36.642 --> 24:38.609
be rather cacophonous.

24:38.611 --> 24:42.046
You know, loud and chirpy.

24:46.585 --> 24:49.320
Rachel told me that you invent apps.

24:49.322 --> 24:50.154
She wasn't lying.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.156
I love apps.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.557
Yeah.

24:53.559 --> 24:54.425
Yeah?

24:54.427 --> 24:55.459
You like your job?

24:55.461 --> 24:58.963
Um, I used to.

24:58.965 --> 25:04.201
I recently sold the, or got bought, merged.

25:04.203 --> 25:09.139
There are any number of ways to
describe what actually went

25:09.141 --> 25:10.941
down with Happy Farm.

25:10.943 --> 25:11.909
Logan, hey.

25:11.911 --> 25:14.044
Buddy, this is McKenna.

25:14.046 --> 25:17.815
She's, um, uh, a friend of your mom's.

25:17.817 --> 25:20.050
I've heard a lot about you.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.018
Yeah?

25:21.020 --> 25:22.987
I love your monkey backpack.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.589
I asked for an elephant.

25:25.591 --> 25:27.291
Well, talk to your mom.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.893
I did.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.895
We're gonna get you hooked up
with breakfast real quick, Mr.

25:30.897 --> 25:33.264
Man, because we are running a little late.

25:33.266 --> 25:35.266
OK.

25:35.268 --> 25:36.267
Hey.

25:36.269 --> 25:37.501
Hi.

25:37.503 --> 25:38.636
Uh, good morning.

25:38.638 --> 25:39.336
Logan, you met my friend McKenna?

25:39.338 --> 25:40.104
Yeah.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.438
McKenna, Jeff.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.072
You got it.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.875
Great.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.277
How did you--

25:46.279 --> 25:47.278
How did you sleep?

25:47.280 --> 25:48.646
Really, really good.

25:48.648 --> 25:49.580
Oh good.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.048
Oh good, you--

25:51.050 --> 25:51.982
Good.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.183
Quiet in here.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.618
Yeah.

25:54.620 --> 25:58.822
So, um, uh, you can take Logan to school today?

25:58.824 --> 26:01.559
Jeff, I just want to make
sure that McKenna is--

26:01.561 --> 26:03.127
-Got it, I am on it.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.194
--taken care of.

26:04.196 --> 26:05.195
Thank you.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.564
OK, great.

26:06.566 --> 26:08.265
You need milk.

26:08.267 --> 26:09.667
OK.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.101
OK, she looks like a completely different person,

26:11.103 --> 26:12.870
I know.

26:12.872 --> 26:13.504
She looks like a college kid or something.

26:13.506 --> 26:14.405
Right?

26:14.407 --> 26:15.573
Dancing is just her job.

26:15.575 --> 26:16.473
A job does not define who you are.

26:16.475 --> 26:17.608
Right.

26:17.610 --> 26:18.676
I really think I can help her.

26:18.678 --> 26:19.710
She had a really difficult life.

26:19.712 --> 26:20.678
Oh, lordy, lordy, lordy.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.146
OK, all right.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.180
I'm shaking it out.

26:23.182 --> 26:23.914
There's a stripper in my pool.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.082
No big.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.517
OK.

26:26.519 --> 26:27.351
Oh, that's a nice looking one.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.252
Yeah, is that OK?

26:28.254 --> 26:29.019
What do strippers like?

26:29.021 --> 26:30.454
Not that, because she's sober.

26:30.456 --> 26:31.221
Oh.

26:31.223 --> 26:31.989
Good for her.

26:31.991 --> 26:35.092
Imagine that you're cleaning out a rim.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.093
OK?

26:36.095 --> 26:37.528
Cleaning out a rim.

26:37.530 --> 26:38.596
It's a big rim.

26:38.598 --> 26:39.463
It's more like a trash can size.

26:39.465 --> 26:40.464
OK.

26:40.466 --> 26:41.465
Oh, like a garbage can rim.

26:41.467 --> 26:42.700
Her shame is trapped there.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.802
We gotta get that exercised.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.904
Be gentle with it.

26:46.906 --> 26:47.538
Shame.

26:47.540 --> 26:48.405
Stephanie!

26:48.407 --> 26:49.139
I really got this.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.541
Stephanie!

26:50.543 --> 26:52.543
You're waking up in the morning.

26:52.545 --> 26:54.545
Should we give her a pole?

26:54.547 --> 26:55.546
-You want--

26:55.548 --> 26:56.547
-Oh shit.

26:56.549 --> 26:57.181
Yeah.

26:57.183 --> 26:58.148
Body.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.883
No, you guys.

26:59.885 --> 27:02.753
Those are the guys that come in and they're like, lap

27:02.755 --> 27:06.423
dance, lap dance, lap dance, every night.

27:06.425 --> 27:09.326
And they always have their favorite girls.

27:09.328 --> 27:13.931
And they're the ones that tell
you things like, oh baby, I'm

27:13.933 --> 27:16.533
gonna be the one that gets to see you for real.

27:16.535 --> 27:17.801
I'm gonna help get you down off of this

27:17.803 --> 27:20.638
pole, blah, blah, blah.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.506
We call them Captain Save-a-Ho.

27:22.508 --> 27:24.475
- Captain Save-a-Ho,
that's hilarious.

27:27.412 --> 27:30.014
Yeah, I made $6,000 of one once.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.686
Wait, 6,000 just for dancing?

27:35.688 --> 27:38.255
Well, some girls dance just to dance, right?

27:38.257 --> 27:42.426
But I like to use the club for
networking, meeting people,

27:42.428 --> 27:44.194
building relationships.

27:44.196 --> 27:46.830
I'm not the kind of girl who's gonna tell you that she'll

27:46.832 --> 27:49.166
strip but she won't get naked,
or she'll give you a lap dance

27:49.168 --> 27:52.569
but she won't touch you, or she'll touch you, but she

27:52.571 --> 27:53.737
won't give you oral.

27:53.739 --> 27:56.273
I'm pretty much down for anything.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.808
Full service sex worker.

28:05.583 --> 28:07.718
-Um, what--

28:07.720 --> 28:09.987
What is a sex worker?

28:09.989 --> 28:16.260
This one guy Warren, I mean, he pays via Paypal.

28:16.262 --> 28:17.227
It's awesome.

28:17.229 --> 28:18.028
There's no cash exchange.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.064
It's very clean.

28:20.066 --> 28:23.434
And then there's this Jack, and he's been my regular on

28:23.436 --> 28:25.469
Tuesdays for like a million years.

28:25.471 --> 28:27.104
I love him like a brother.

28:29.441 --> 28:32.242
He's your kind of run of the mill, typical

28:32.244 --> 28:34.745
vanilla kinky guy.

28:34.747 --> 28:37.014
He's into some weird shit.

28:37.016 --> 28:39.817
He sometimes likes a girl to watch.

28:45.056 --> 28:48.225
You should come, Rachel.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.593
Yes, you should.

28:49.595 --> 28:51.061
You really should.

28:51.063 --> 28:55.566
I'll take Logan to soccer so you can go.

28:55.568 --> 28:58.502
Thank you, that would be a huge help.

28:58.504 --> 28:59.570
Sorry.

28:59.572 --> 29:01.872
I'm gonna ruing a perfectly good blow out.

29:38.042 --> 29:39.409
Hey Captain Save-a-Ho.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.011
She's a hooker.

29:41.013 --> 29:41.979
Sh, it's OK.

29:41.981 --> 29:42.880
No, it's not OK.

29:42.882 --> 29:43.647
Yeah it is.

29:43.649 --> 29:45.182
Is that a nursing bra?

29:45.184 --> 29:46.150
Oh, yeah.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.117
Logan's five.

29:47.119 --> 29:50.120
Throw it the fuck out.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.157
You didn't know about that part, right?

29:53.159 --> 29:55.359
The friends I see sometimes?

29:55.361 --> 29:57.628
You were right about that.

29:57.630 --> 29:59.963
You still want me to stay at the house?

30:02.634 --> 30:05.969
If you want out of that life, I can help you.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.172
I mean, I've saved first and last month's rent.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.440
I could give that to you.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.075
And I could help take care of Logan.

30:12.077 --> 30:14.511
Exactly, but no money.

30:14.513 --> 30:18.549
I'd feel weird taking something from you.

30:18.551 --> 30:21.218
If you think that I can help you, I

30:21.220 --> 30:23.954
promise, you're not taking.

30:26.291 --> 30:27.991
It's inappropriate.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.693
- Aren't you supposed to
be non-judgmental?

30:29.695 --> 30:32.830
I'm supposed to be clear mirror, baccarat crystal.

30:32.832 --> 30:35.265
Excuse me, I have to eat something.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.834
I was recently diagnosed with

30:36.836 --> 30:39.269
perimenopausal low blood sugar.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.309
I brought quinoa from home.

30:52.517 --> 30:59.022
She just seems way too young
and, I don't know, healthy to

30:59.024 --> 31:01.158
be spending her time having sex for money.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.060
Isn't that her choice?

31:03.062 --> 31:04.962
May I share something?

31:04.964 --> 31:06.730
When Portia was in
graduate school--

31:06.732 --> 31:08.565
-No, Lenore, I don't wanna hear about Portia.

31:08.567 --> 31:11.034
I think that's inappropriate.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.904
I don't know why I wanna take care of McKenna.

31:13.906 --> 31:17.040
I mean, what if I listen to you and I'm like, oh, Lenore

31:17.042 --> 31:19.710
says it's inappropriate, so I guess it's inappropriate.

31:19.712 --> 31:20.944
So I go home and I'm like, sorry, McKenna.

31:20.946 --> 31:23.013
Turns out, this is inappropriate.

31:23.015 --> 31:28.151
So, out she goes, back on the street, robbed of her one

31:28.153 --> 31:30.120
opportunity she had to finally escape

31:30.122 --> 31:31.421
from being a sex worker.

31:31.423 --> 31:32.723
What's a sex worker?

31:32.725 --> 31:33.590
That's what she calls it.

31:33.592 --> 31:34.591
She's a prostitute.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.393
That is such an awful word.

31:36.395 --> 31:40.030
It's a highly accurate word, Rachel.

31:40.032 --> 31:41.632
I think I need a break from therapy.

31:41.634 --> 31:43.200
Well, I think that's ill advised.

31:43.202 --> 31:45.335
Just last week, you were complaining about how you and

31:45.337 --> 31:47.004
Jeff are no longer making love.

31:47.006 --> 31:49.439
I mean, if you wanna choose words, let's

31:49.441 --> 31:51.241
just call it not fucking.

31:51.243 --> 31:54.544
I think you should start coming in twice a week.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.117
Mwah.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.485
Bye.

32:01.487 --> 32:03.086
Oh, hey.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.055
Uh, this is, uh--

32:05.057 --> 32:07.124
This is, um, Amanda and Meredith.

32:07.126 --> 32:11.128
Nice to meet you.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.463
Bye.

32:13.465 --> 32:14.431
Stephanie.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.399
Oh, McKenna.

32:15.401 --> 32:16.233
Oh my gosh.

32:16.235 --> 32:16.867
You're still here.

32:16.869 --> 32:20.637
Yeah, uh, um, I'm teaching her about drop offs in case

32:20.639 --> 32:22.072
she has to do a drop off.

32:22.074 --> 32:24.107
Well, I'll see you guys soon.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.108
OK, bye.

32:25.110 --> 32:28.445
If it's a Monday, you wanna bring his math stuff with

32:28.447 --> 32:29.079
you--

32:29.081 --> 32:30.847
- And if it's a Friday,
you wanna--

32:30.849 --> 32:34.518
Did you ever get my sign up paper for Craftacular?

32:34.520 --> 32:35.652
Oh.

32:35.654 --> 32:36.420
Because I didn't see your name.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.788
I'm so sorry.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.456
I'm sorry, I forgot.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.190
Hi.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.358
Who's this?

32:41.360 --> 32:43.994
Oh, uh, this is Logan's new nanny.

32:43.996 --> 32:45.062
This is McKenna.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.597
McKenna, this is Jennie.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.066
Oh, nice to meet you.

32:49.068 --> 32:50.934
Wow, you been thinking about going back to work Rach?

32:50.936 --> 32:51.868
Yeah, thinking about thinking about it.

32:51.870 --> 32:52.636
Great.

32:52.638 --> 32:53.904
Where you from?

32:53.906 --> 32:55.105
I'm from Chico in Northern California.

32:55.107 --> 32:56.807
Yeah, I found her through an agency.

32:56.809 --> 33:00.110
Well, careful, because I am known to steal nannies.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.878
I am a nanny stealer.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.146
Hey.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.581
Do you wanna--

33:04.583 --> 33:06.984
Do you wanna captain a table at Craftacular, McKenna?

33:06.986 --> 33:09.853
It's, like, a lot of kids doing crafts, raising money

33:09.855 --> 33:11.421
for Jewish women with cancer.

33:11.423 --> 33:15.192
Jennie, I am so sorry, but I gotta show McKenna where the

33:15.194 --> 33:15.826
dry cleaners is.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.694
It was nice to meet you.

33:17.696 --> 33:18.862
I'll register.

33:18.864 --> 33:20.197
I promise.

33:23.401 --> 33:25.936
Just like another week, until she gets on her feet.

33:25.938 --> 33:31.274
What exactly do you intend to do for her?

33:31.276 --> 33:33.043
Help her tell her story.

33:33.045 --> 33:37.080
Maybe I can help her set up a blog.

33:37.082 --> 33:38.949
She and I could co-blog.

33:38.951 --> 33:40.150
-You wanna--

33:40.152 --> 33:41.952
You wanna blog with her?

33:41.954 --> 33:44.721
A lot of good things have come from blogging.

33:44.723 --> 33:47.824
Name one good thing that's come from blogging.

33:47.826 --> 33:50.494
OK, that crunchy kale salad that I made.

33:50.496 --> 33:53.063
That was from someone's blog.

33:53.065 --> 33:55.565
Blogging's amazing.

33:55.567 --> 33:59.202
So, and we are recording.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.704
OK.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.539
So, we are not sure what this is
going to be yet, if this is

34:02.541 --> 34:08.378
gonna be a blog, a co-blog,
article, podcast.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.079
We're going to just--

34:09.081 --> 34:10.347
Who knows?

34:10.349 --> 34:11.514
Keep it loose.

34:11.516 --> 34:12.949
Right now we're just
gonna have a--

34:12.951 --> 34:15.152
just a-- just going to call--
call it a conversation.

34:15.154 --> 34:15.752
Yeah.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.320
OK.

34:17.322 --> 34:21.358
You are a sex worker.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.192
Yes.

34:22.194 --> 34:23.627
I'm a sex worker.

34:23.629 --> 34:28.165
And you have been, uh, working in sex for how long?

34:28.167 --> 34:29.232
Two years.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.833
I started when I was 20.

34:33.804 --> 34:36.039
You told me you were 19.

34:36.041 --> 34:38.475
I tell all my customers that.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.577
It's like, a barely legal thing.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.045
It turns them on.

34:43.047 --> 34:48.318
What does it mean to see other people as customers?

34:48.320 --> 34:51.088
Doctors have customers, psychiatrists have customers,

34:51.090 --> 34:53.123
people that work in stores have customers.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.858
A lot of people in this world have customers.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.426
What if those customers had wives?

34:56.428 --> 34:58.662
So?

34:58.664 --> 35:00.864
- You didn't feel a sense
of responsibility or--

35:00.866 --> 35:02.099
-No.

35:02.101 --> 35:02.966
Sisterliness?

35:02.968 --> 35:04.401
No.

35:04.403 --> 35:05.936
Compassion?

35:05.938 --> 35:09.139
Yeah, I feel compassion for a world where men have a way

35:09.141 --> 35:14.611
higher sex drive, and it's a proven fact, and their wives

35:14.613 --> 35:16.847
lose interest in having sex with term.

35:16.849 --> 35:18.982
Yeah, I feel compassion for that.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.454
Oh my god.

35:24.456 --> 35:26.957
Thank you for coming home.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.525
Thank you for calling me home.

35:30.862 --> 35:34.798
This is not at all what I had scheduled for my afternoon.

35:49.447 --> 35:50.447
Hey.

35:50.449 --> 35:51.214
What?

35:51.216 --> 35:52.449
Open your eyes.

35:52.451 --> 35:53.216
What?

35:53.218 --> 35:54.050
Do me a favor.

35:54.052 --> 35:55.051
Open your eyes.

35:55.053 --> 35:56.052
Hey.

35:56.054 --> 35:57.053
Hi.

35:57.055 --> 35:59.856
You wanna try having an eyes open orgasm?

35:59.858 --> 36:01.525
Yeah?

36:01.527 --> 36:02.492
Like this?

36:02.494 --> 36:03.460
There you are.

36:03.462 --> 36:04.227
Hey, hello, how are you?

36:04.229 --> 36:06.997
Hey, long time.

36:06.999 --> 36:08.298
You know what?

36:08.300 --> 36:08.932
Close them.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.367
I'm sorry.

36:10.369 --> 36:11.067
Just keep them closed.

36:11.069 --> 36:15.906
Do what you gotta do.

36:15.908 --> 36:17.440
Sorry.

36:17.442 --> 36:18.909
Oh, I'm good.

36:18.911 --> 36:22.112
Yeah.

36:22.114 --> 36:23.446
I can get back in there.

36:23.448 --> 36:25.182
No, no, no, no, no, no.

36:25.184 --> 36:25.882
No?

36:25.884 --> 36:29.853
Takes a second to get back on the bus.

36:29.855 --> 36:30.554
Yep.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.489
Been a while.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.024
Glad we did it though, so.

36:34.026 --> 36:34.991
Yeah, yeah.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.159
Nice work.

36:36.161 --> 36:37.627
Right.

36:37.629 --> 36:43.200
Um, so, I can when I get back later tonight from work.

36:43.202 --> 36:44.134
Yeah?

36:44.136 --> 36:48.371
Um, actually, I'm gonna be much later than I thought.

36:48.373 --> 36:49.673
No worries.

36:49.675 --> 36:50.540
Because I had to reschedule this conference

36:50.542 --> 36:52.576
call and I have to--

36:53.579 --> 36:54.611
Hold on.

36:54.613 --> 36:55.545
Someone's calling me right now.

36:55.547 --> 36:56.246
Hello?

36:56.248 --> 36:57.147
Yeah, hey.

36:57.149 --> 36:58.148
This is Jeff.

36:58.150 --> 37:01.051
If they're still on the call, I
need you to patch me through

37:01.053 --> 37:02.385
right away.

37:21.339 --> 37:23.340
--We're running late, honey.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.308
My legs are stuck.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.310
Logan.

37:27.312 --> 37:28.979
Logan, you have to help me.

37:28.981 --> 37:31.014
Flex your legs.

37:31.016 --> 37:32.349
Let go.

37:39.091 --> 37:40.423
Mhmm.

37:42.126 --> 37:43.960
Hi.

37:43.962 --> 37:46.763
Jeff said that you were sick.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.199
Oh, I feel Shit City.

37:49.201 --> 37:50.834
I'm all right, I think.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.636
You know your body's not gonna heal

37:52.638 --> 37:54.304
if you mind's tweaking.

37:54.306 --> 37:55.071
-I'm not--

37:55.073 --> 37:56.473
No, wait, I--

37:56.475 --> 37:58.041
McKenna, I have to reach out.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.743
I have to reach out to hot dog
vendors for this Craftacular

37:59.745 --> 38:02.012
or Jennie is going to kill me.

38:02.014 --> 38:03.113
Do you have any of

38:03.115 --> 38:04.281
that menthol rub stuff?

38:04.283 --> 38:05.450
Do you know what I'm talking about?

38:08.185 --> 38:09.452
McKenna, I'm fine.

38:09.454 --> 38:10.420
Ah, ah, ah.

38:10.422 --> 38:11.688
You do have it.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.323
McKenna, I don't need anything.

38:13.325 --> 38:14.858
Do you have a sock?

38:14.860 --> 38:16.459
Can I use these?

38:16.461 --> 38:17.494
I mean, those are gross.

38:17.496 --> 38:18.261
I don't know what you're even.

38:18.263 --> 38:19.296
Smells fine.

38:19.298 --> 38:19.929
You don't have to do anything.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.097
OK.

38:21.099 --> 38:22.699
-I don't even--

38:22.701 --> 38:25.068
-Give me your foot.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.336
Again, honey.

38:26.338 --> 38:29.072
Please, I am total--

38:29.074 --> 38:30.407
-Put it down.

38:30.409 --> 38:32.275
I am fine.

38:32.277 --> 38:33.043
Lay down.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.477
Lady.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.446
I am fine.

38:36.448 --> 38:37.580
OK?

38:37.582 --> 38:39.082
Just pause.

38:42.353 --> 38:43.887
OK.

39:00.504 --> 39:02.439
My grandma used to do this to me and my cousins

39:02.441 --> 39:04.107
when we were sick.

39:04.109 --> 39:05.241
Grandma.

39:05.243 --> 39:06.509
Yeah.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.044
Grandma Ninny.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.088
Did you say Ninny?

39:18.090 --> 39:19.089
Mhmm.

39:19.091 --> 39:20.457
My mom's mom.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.859
I lived with her a lot.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.762
You have to keep your feet warm.

39:28.799 --> 39:31.101
You do not have to do this.

39:33.938 --> 39:35.271
Makes me happy.

39:59.897 --> 40:02.165
I can feel in your feet where you're blocked.

40:04.702 --> 40:06.236
In your right hip.

40:09.473 --> 40:12.041
We'll just shake it out.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.376
OK.

40:15.780 --> 40:18.481
Just shake it out a little.

40:29.059 --> 40:33.329
Oh yeah, it's really right in here.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.070
OK.

40:43.574 --> 40:45.375
Can I open this?

40:48.813 --> 40:49.612
Um.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.347
I'm not wearing a bra.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.849
Just breathe.

42:30.347 --> 42:33.316
Hey, cute dress.

42:33.318 --> 42:34.183
Thanks.

42:34.185 --> 42:36.119
You look so pretty.

42:36.121 --> 42:37.453
Where you going?

42:43.227 --> 42:46.996
Do you really wanna know?

42:46.998 --> 42:48.798
Of course.

42:48.800 --> 42:51.401
I'm going to play with Jack.

42:51.403 --> 42:52.835
-Oh, is that the--

42:52.837 --> 42:54.504
Is that the Paypal
one, or the--

42:54.506 --> 42:55.305
No, he's the other one.

42:55.307 --> 42:56.272
Oh, the nice one.

42:56.274 --> 42:56.973
Mhmm.

42:56.975 --> 42:59.142
Oh, good.

42:59.144 --> 43:00.410
OK.

43:03.882 --> 43:06.583
Are you sure you wanna go?

43:06.585 --> 43:08.151
Yeah, my mom called.

43:08.153 --> 43:11.854
Um, she's getting evicted, so I
need to make her some cash.

43:11.856 --> 43:14.624
-But I mean, if you--

43:14.626 --> 43:16.259
I you want me to pay you instead of the room.

43:16.261 --> 43:19.963
I make $250 an hour.

43:19.965 --> 43:22.298
OK, well I know you're not asking for my permission, so.

43:24.868 --> 43:25.868
OK, bye.

43:25.870 --> 43:27.003
Bye.

43:27.005 --> 43:28.338
See ya.

43:33.210 --> 43:34.544
Do you need a ride?

43:40.117 --> 43:41.451
OK.

43:45.022 --> 43:47.757
OK.

43:47.759 --> 43:49.959
Are you sure you don't need a ride home?

43:49.961 --> 43:51.961
He always calls me a cab.

43:51.963 --> 43:53.596
Oh.

43:53.598 --> 43:55.131
Thank you.

43:58.202 --> 43:59.202
Bye.

43:59.204 --> 44:00.470
Bye.

44:02.506 --> 44:04.040
Hi Willy.

44:16.754 --> 44:18.421
Are you kicking the table?

44:18.423 --> 44:19.389
Mhmm.

44:19.391 --> 44:20.123
Stop.

44:20.125 --> 44:22.325
It's rude.

44:22.327 --> 44:23.860
Thank you.

44:25.663 --> 44:27.563
The road to dessert is paved with chicken, sir.

44:27.565 --> 44:28.965
That's right.

44:28.967 --> 44:30.667
I really want dessert.

44:30.669 --> 44:31.668
And you're gonna get some.

44:31.670 --> 44:33.002
Stop kicking the the table.

44:33.004 --> 44:34.404
The road to dessert is also paved with beef.

44:34.406 --> 44:35.271
Come on.

44:37.475 --> 44:39.342
There she is.

44:39.344 --> 44:40.243
McKenna, you hungry?

44:40.245 --> 44:41.477
Plenty of food.

44:41.479 --> 44:42.879
Uh, no thanks.

44:42.881 --> 44:45.081
I'm gonna go straight to bed.

44:45.083 --> 44:46.082
Good night!

44:46.084 --> 44:47.784
OK, sleep tight.

45:05.369 --> 45:06.369
Finally.

45:06.371 --> 45:09.305
Oh my god, wow.

45:09.307 --> 45:10.206
Look at you.

45:10.208 --> 45:10.973
You look unbelievable.

45:10.975 --> 45:12.075
Hey baby.

45:12.077 --> 45:13.409
Look what you did.

45:13.411 --> 45:14.110
I'm proud.

45:14.112 --> 45:15.378
You did so good.

45:15.380 --> 45:16.012
Wow.

45:16.014 --> 45:17.880
I'm so proud of you.

45:17.882 --> 45:20.616
Take it easy Horn Dog McCrosby.

45:20.618 --> 45:22.051
Look, Rachel's got her boobies out.

45:22.053 --> 45:23.986
What the what, Rachel?

45:23.988 --> 45:25.588
Come over here.

45:25.590 --> 45:26.322
Make a little Matty sandwich.

45:26.324 --> 45:27.090
OK.

45:27.092 --> 45:28.291
Hold on.

45:28.293 --> 45:29.058
Everybody.

45:29.060 --> 45:30.927
All right, we gotta go.

45:30.929 --> 45:31.794
All right, where's your mansicle?

45:31.796 --> 45:32.562
Uh, you mean Jeff?

45:32.564 --> 45:33.796
He's over there.

45:33.798 --> 45:34.831
Sup Jeff Boyardee?

45:34.833 --> 45:35.531
This way.

45:35.533 --> 45:36.232
This way.

45:36.234 --> 45:36.866
Excuse me.

45:36.868 --> 45:38.134
Yeah?

45:38.136 --> 45:38.968
Don't freak out.

45:38.970 --> 45:40.603
OK.

45:40.605 --> 45:41.637
Get a bracelet on this one.

45:41.639 --> 45:43.206
Oh, yep.

45:43.208 --> 45:46.109
And, uh, I don't mean to be
unkind, you guys, but I sweat,

45:46.111 --> 45:49.011
if I see anybody walking around without a bracelet, I'm

45:49.013 --> 45:50.413
gonna shit myself.

45:50.415 --> 45:51.814
-Yeah, I--

45:51.816 --> 45:53.082
I'm really sorry about what happened last year.

45:53.084 --> 45:54.150
No, don't even worry about it, because

45:54.152 --> 45:56.519
Actually, that was completely your fault, but I'm

45:56.521 --> 45:57.987
totally over it.

45:57.989 --> 45:59.956
All right, I want you here with Amanda, and just figure

45:59.958 --> 46:02.325
out between the two of you who's gonna do bracelets,

46:02.327 --> 46:03.559
who's gonna take credit cards.

46:03.561 --> 46:04.694
-Uh, I'm--

46:04.696 --> 46:06.229
I'm doing hot dogs with Stephanie.

46:06.231 --> 46:08.931
Oh, honey, all due respect, you kinda dropped the ball on

46:08.933 --> 46:12.301
the hot dogs, so I gave it to Alisa.

46:12.303 --> 46:13.603
Sorry, I--

46:13.605 --> 46:15.104
I need to borrow my husband for one second.

46:15.106 --> 46:15.938
I'm so sorry.

46:15.940 --> 46:16.606
What?

46:16.608 --> 46:17.340
You're leaving?

46:17.342 --> 46:18.074
Yeah.

46:18.076 --> 46:20.443
Because that's how it works.

46:20.445 --> 46:22.211
The women tell the men where to set up the folding table,

46:22.213 --> 46:24.213
and the men set up the folding
table so men are free to go.

46:24.215 --> 46:25.214
That's gross.

46:25.216 --> 46:26.582
Just hang with Steph, OK?

46:26.584 --> 46:28.151
Talk shit about the moms.

46:28.153 --> 46:29.152
You guys'll have fun.

46:29.154 --> 46:30.019
I'm off of hot dogs.

46:30.021 --> 46:33.723
You don't get to make fun of me and go surfing.

46:33.725 --> 46:35.124
I'm with fucking kosher Amanda.

46:35.126 --> 46:38.227
This is fucking kosher Amanda's face all the time.

46:38.229 --> 46:39.061
You're right.

46:39.063 --> 46:39.962
That is her face.

46:39.964 --> 46:41.364
Yeah.

46:41.366 --> 46:42.131
That's her resting face.

46:42.133 --> 46:43.666
That is her face.

46:43.668 --> 46:44.634
This is her baseline.

46:44.636 --> 46:46.002
I wanna see how it feels.

46:46.004 --> 46:47.069
Huh, this is how it feels to be kosher Amanda.

46:47.071 --> 46:48.538
-Mm-mm.

46:48.540 --> 46:49.705
All right, I'm going surfing.

46:49.707 --> 46:50.406
I can't believe you're leaving me.

46:50.408 --> 46:51.374
Bye.

46:51.376 --> 46:52.909
It's not fair, Jeff.

47:16.967 --> 47:17.934
-Seriously, I'm--

47:17.936 --> 47:20.269
I'm doing it.

47:20.271 --> 47:21.304
Whoa.

47:21.306 --> 47:22.638
Last night, we're going crazy.

47:22.640 --> 47:23.606
Go, go go!

47:23.608 --> 47:25.308
Go, go, go, go, go!

47:36.286 --> 47:38.487
Can Logan go home with Owen?

47:38.489 --> 47:39.489
Well, yeah.

47:39.490 --> 47:40.623
I know, I'm sorry you guys.

47:40.625 --> 47:42.458
Of course, I hope you feel better.

47:42.460 --> 47:43.259
Awful cramps.

47:43.261 --> 47:44.327
OK.

47:44.329 --> 47:45.228
Paddle, paddle,

47:45.230 --> 47:46.128
paddle, paddle, paddle.

47:46.130 --> 47:48.231
Hop up, hop up!

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Jefferey!

47:51.002 --> 47:52.001
Super stud!

47:52.003 --> 47:53.803
Yeah yeah!

47:53.805 --> 47:55.338
McKenna?

47:57.809 --> 47:59.575
Going to Jack's?

47:59.577 --> 48:00.409
Yeah.

48:00.411 --> 48:02.211
I'm coming with you.

48:21.632 --> 48:23.633
Can I check those?

48:23.635 --> 48:25.601
Why is that weird?

48:25.603 --> 48:29.171
How come no one believes in us?

48:29.173 --> 48:30.673
I believe in us.

48:30.675 --> 48:32.375
If we don't believe in us, who's gonna believe in us?

48:32.377 --> 48:33.409
Yeah, come on, Craig.

48:33.411 --> 48:34.243
Is that the name of our band?

48:34.245 --> 48:35.077
We Believe in Us?

48:35.079 --> 48:37.613
How about just Dadz, with a Z on the end.

48:37.615 --> 48:39.982
Surf Godz with a Z.
I don't care Want.

48:39.984 --> 48:41.350
I just want a Z to be somewhere in the

48:41.352 --> 48:43.085
title of the band name.

49:19.756 --> 49:21.357
Oh, I need a new name.

49:21.359 --> 49:22.525
Oh, yeah.

49:22.527 --> 49:23.159
Right?

49:23.161 --> 49:23.893
Mhmm.

49:23.895 --> 49:24.760
Sophia?

49:24.762 --> 49:25.895
Again?

49:25.897 --> 49:28.197
Oh my god.

49:28.199 --> 49:29.365
Cassidy?

49:29.367 --> 49:32.034
No.

49:32.036 --> 49:33.502
Ariel?

49:33.504 --> 49:35.504
No.

49:35.506 --> 49:37.506
Samantha?

49:37.508 --> 49:41.544
Um, Shelly?

49:41.546 --> 49:43.112
Maybe.

49:43.114 --> 49:44.447
Shelly.

49:53.291 --> 49:54.824
Coming.

49:57.027 --> 49:58.361
Hey, baby.

49:58.363 --> 49:59.895
Hi.

50:10.875 --> 50:12.241
Hey.

50:12.243 --> 50:14.410
How are you?

50:14.412 --> 50:16.445
Good, how are you?

50:16.447 --> 50:17.413
I'm really good.

50:17.415 --> 50:20.182
And, uh, this is my friend.

50:20.184 --> 50:21.117
Savannah.

50:21.119 --> 50:22.985
Savannah.

50:22.987 --> 50:25.021
Hi Savannah.

50:25.023 --> 50:26.355
Hi.

50:29.226 --> 50:31.193
Can I take your coat?

50:31.195 --> 50:32.161
Oh, please.

50:32.163 --> 50:34.463
Uh, thank you.

50:34.465 --> 50:36.032
Wow.

50:36.034 --> 50:37.366
You're beautiful.

50:39.770 --> 50:41.370
May I get you a drink.

50:41.372 --> 50:43.339
Uh, yes, thank you.

50:43.341 --> 50:43.973
Scotch.

50:43.975 --> 50:45.274
Yes.

50:59.523 --> 51:01.424
Here you go.

51:01.426 --> 51:02.992
Thank you.

51:02.994 --> 51:06.328
Yeah.

51:06.330 --> 51:08.431
Savannah, there's no pressure.

51:08.433 --> 51:12.334
McKenna told me you wanted to,
um, share the experience, and

51:12.336 --> 51:14.670
I, uh, I really admire that.

51:14.672 --> 51:16.772
Oh, thank you.

51:16.774 --> 51:20.643
I'd really love for you to just watch.

51:20.645 --> 51:22.178
-Great, that's what I'll--

51:22.180 --> 51:23.446
That's what I'll do.

51:23.448 --> 51:25.481
Totally get me off.

51:25.483 --> 51:27.049
Um.

51:27.051 --> 51:30.086
And, if, at any time, you feel
uncomfortable, then you just

51:30.088 --> 51:32.788
come on out here and, you know, sit down and chill.

51:32.790 --> 51:36.492
So, this won't be happening in this space, then?

51:36.494 --> 51:39.528
It's gonna be somewhere else?

51:39.530 --> 51:40.496
Or is-- is it thi--

51:40.498 --> 51:41.697
Is this where it happens?

51:41.699 --> 51:42.898
She's cute.

51:42.900 --> 51:44.300
You told me she's cute, but she's cute.

51:44.302 --> 51:46.302
You're cute.

51:46.304 --> 51:47.269
No.

51:47.271 --> 51:48.404
It happens in the bedroom.

51:48.406 --> 51:49.472
Ah, of course.

51:49.474 --> 51:50.873
May I show you the bedroom?

51:50.875 --> 51:52.007
Oh, you don't have to.

51:52.009 --> 51:52.908
I mean--

51:52.910 --> 51:57.179
whatever you guys normally--

51:57.181 --> 51:58.047
You know.

51:58.049 --> 51:59.281
Whatever.

51:59.283 --> 52:00.082
You know.

52:00.084 --> 52:01.984
You go--

52:01.986 --> 52:04.253
Why don't you just come sit down?

52:04.255 --> 52:05.387
She's sweet.

52:05.389 --> 52:07.656
Give some of this to your friend.

52:07.658 --> 52:10.593
Thank you.

52:10.595 --> 52:12.194
I think it's time for bedroom.

52:12.196 --> 52:13.395
Let's go.

52:13.397 --> 52:13.997
Come on, let's go.

52:13.998 --> 52:15.297
OK.

52:15.299 --> 52:16.832
You ready, Savannah?

52:20.237 --> 52:21.470
Yeah.

52:21.472 --> 52:23.105
OK, let's go.

52:25.609 --> 52:27.476
Get me hard.

52:27.478 --> 52:28.444
I will.

52:28.446 --> 52:30.479
I will.

52:30.481 --> 52:32.481
You know that I will.

52:36.253 --> 52:39.421
Sitting on this chaise lounge.

52:39.423 --> 52:40.389
Beautiful.

52:40.391 --> 52:41.624
Oh yeah.

52:41.626 --> 52:43.125
Mm.

52:47.697 --> 52:49.131
Oh, I'm sorry, one more question.

52:49.133 --> 52:51.600
Sorry, I didn't mean to put a damper on anything.

52:51.602 --> 52:52.368
You're not.

52:52.370 --> 52:53.636
OK, good.

52:53.638 --> 52:54.770
I just was, uh, wondering how long these

52:54.772 --> 52:56.805
sessions usually last.

52:56.807 --> 52:58.340
Uh, like about an hour, right Jack?

52:58.342 --> 52:59.642
Yeah, about an hour.

52:59.644 --> 53:00.543
Oh, well great.

53:00.545 --> 53:01.877
Good.

53:01.879 --> 53:02.645
Don't have to make a phone call.

53:02.647 --> 53:03.279
So, I'm good.

53:03.281 --> 53:03.979
Great.

53:03.981 --> 53:05.481
Wonderful.

53:05.483 --> 53:07.149
Go about your business.

53:07.151 --> 53:11.020
I'll shut up now.

53:11.022 --> 53:11.820
Oh yeah.

53:11.822 --> 53:13.822
Can you see, Savannah?

53:13.824 --> 53:15.457
Yes, I'm fine.

53:15.459 --> 53:16.392
I'm fine.

53:16.394 --> 53:17.860
Yeah?

53:17.862 --> 53:19.261
Oh my god, you're getting so hard.

53:19.263 --> 53:20.529
-Fuck yeah, I am getting--

53:20.531 --> 53:21.664
Baby!

53:21.666 --> 53:22.431
Are you sure you can see, honey?

53:22.433 --> 53:23.399
-Mm-hm.

53:23.401 --> 53:25.534
Oh yeah, that's it.

53:25.536 --> 53:27.336
I want you to see me.

53:27.338 --> 53:29.672
I do.

53:29.674 --> 53:34.176
I don't think you can.

53:36.514 --> 53:37.546
Come to daddy.

53:37.548 --> 53:41.116
I'm coming!

53:41.118 --> 53:43.118
Hey.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.120
Oh yeah.

53:45.122 --> 53:46.522
Yeah?

53:46.524 --> 53:47.523
Look at this, Savannah.

53:47.525 --> 53:49.058
Take it in.

53:55.499 --> 53:58.500
Savannah, can you take my hand?

53:58.502 --> 53:59.969
Come here.

54:21.292 --> 54:23.859
Oh, yeah.

54:52.422 --> 54:53.389
Are you OK?

54:53.391 --> 54:54.290
Yeah.

54:54.292 --> 54:55.758
I think we should go.

54:55.760 --> 54:56.659
Well, let me give you your cash.

54:56.661 --> 54:58.193
No, I don't want it.

55:32.729 --> 55:35.297
Babe?

55:35.299 --> 55:36.231
Yeah?

55:36.233 --> 55:38.233
Hey.

55:38.235 --> 55:39.768
Guess what?

55:41.571 --> 55:44.640
I got up.

55:44.642 --> 55:46.608
What are you talking about?

55:46.610 --> 55:47.609
I stood up.

55:47.611 --> 55:48.610
I got up.

55:48.612 --> 55:51.313
Your husband is a surfer.

55:56.152 --> 55:57.486
OK.

56:01.458 --> 56:04.360
What are you wearing?

56:04.362 --> 56:05.327
What is this outfit?

56:05.329 --> 56:06.495
What--

56:06.497 --> 56:08.097
why do you have all this makeup on?

56:08.099 --> 56:12.601
Um, after Craftacular, I went to Nordstrom's.

56:12.603 --> 56:15.270
I let a very aggressive sales lady do my makeup.

56:15.272 --> 56:16.038
Huh.

56:16.040 --> 56:17.239
Where's Logan?

56:17.241 --> 56:19.775
Jennie's playing with him.

56:19.777 --> 56:21.543
OK.

56:21.545 --> 56:23.078
You look like someone else.

56:55.178 --> 56:56.512
Get in bed.

57:09.726 --> 57:12.928
Make sure you give your brother a turn.

57:12.930 --> 57:14.363
Mazels, buddy.

57:14.365 --> 57:15.097
Tremendous spread.

57:15.099 --> 57:16.632
Let's do it here.

57:16.634 --> 57:17.266
Makes life much easier.

57:17.268 --> 57:18.167
Hey.

57:18.169 --> 57:19.401
Sorry, I just woke up.

57:19.403 --> 57:20.636
Sorry, I passed out.

57:20.638 --> 57:22.371
What are all these people doing here?

57:22.373 --> 57:23.172
What are you talking about?

57:23.174 --> 57:24.373
It's brunch.

57:24.375 --> 57:25.340
I told you I was going to get bagels.

57:25.342 --> 57:26.442
Do we have Half N' Half?

57:26.444 --> 57:27.543
-I-- no, I don't know.

57:27.545 --> 57:28.577
It's fine.

57:28.579 --> 57:29.645
Everyone's having a good time.

57:29.647 --> 57:30.879
Hi, ladies.

57:30.881 --> 57:32.114
Hi.

57:32.116 --> 57:33.115
What's going on?

57:33.117 --> 57:34.116
You are a mess.

57:34.118 --> 57:35.484
What's happening?

57:35.486 --> 57:37.152
Did you just wake up?

57:37.154 --> 57:38.921
Everyone's seeing things under here.

57:38.923 --> 57:41.490
Anyone tell you we were coming here today?

57:41.492 --> 57:44.126
I totally blanked on it.

57:44.128 --> 57:45.194
Oh, no.

57:45.196 --> 57:46.728
I've got to make my leave.

57:46.730 --> 57:49.064
You sure Mason has growing foods?

57:49.066 --> 57:50.499
I've got to go set up for Women and Wine.

57:50.501 --> 57:51.500
OK.

57:51.502 --> 57:53.035
Women and Wine is tonight?

57:53.037 --> 57:54.837
The men are playing poker, and Logan can go to Meredith's

57:54.839 --> 57:56.371
to be with the boys if he wants.

57:56.373 --> 57:59.608
Oh, can McKenna come watch the girls, just like, sit with

57:59.610 --> 58:02.044
them over at that, uh, Amanda's?

58:02.046 --> 58:03.011
McKenna!

58:03.013 --> 58:05.848
Do you-- do you-- do you
have plans tonight?

58:05.850 --> 58:08.016
Like, do you want to come hang out with like, four really

58:08.018 --> 58:10.452
cute girls, do a bunch of dress up?

58:10.454 --> 58:12.254
It'd be so fun.

58:12.256 --> 58:12.888
Sure.

58:12.890 --> 58:14.456
I can do it.

58:14.458 --> 58:15.591
I can, don't worry about it.

58:15.593 --> 58:16.358
I will actually--
you know what?

58:16.360 --> 58:17.226
I'll just call--

58:17.228 --> 58:18.126
-No, no, it's fine.

58:18.128 --> 58:18.994
I had no plans tonight.

58:18.996 --> 58:21.063
Oh, I love you.

58:21.065 --> 58:22.364
OK, good.

58:22.366 --> 58:23.332
See you later.

58:23.334 --> 58:24.800
Can we just do that?

58:24.802 --> 58:26.235
No, it's a great idea.

58:26.237 --> 58:27.002
Yeah, yeah.

58:27.004 --> 58:28.403
All right, I'm out of here.

58:32.575 --> 58:35.477
I don't want McKenna to sit the girls tonight.

58:35.479 --> 58:36.812
What?

58:36.814 --> 58:38.881
I don't want McKenna to sit the girls tonight.

58:47.023 --> 58:49.391
Could you tell her it's not gonna work out, or you found

58:49.393 --> 58:50.092
somebody else?

58:50.094 --> 58:53.395
You want me to tell her?

58:53.397 --> 58:56.265
Yes.

58:56.267 --> 58:57.966
I don't want to.

58:57.968 --> 58:58.634
-Well, wha--

58:58.636 --> 58:59.768
I don't--

58:59.770 --> 59:01.603
-Just be my friend and tell her.

59:01.605 --> 59:03.138
Here you go.

59:12.816 --> 59:14.349
Come in.

59:16.820 --> 59:21.757
Jennie called, and Meredith found someone to watch the

59:21.759 --> 59:25.794
girls, so you're off the hook for tonight.

59:25.796 --> 59:27.763
Why?

59:27.765 --> 59:32.968
Honestly Rachel and I were talking, and, I don't know.

59:32.970 --> 59:34.269
She's just a little uncomfortable

59:34.271 --> 59:37.272
with the whole thing.

59:37.274 --> 59:38.807
Rachel is uncomfortable?

59:38.809 --> 59:40.142
Yeah.

59:41.878 --> 59:45.747
The girls are, um, really young, you know?

59:45.749 --> 59:49.217
Two of them are in
preschool, so--

59:49.219 --> 59:51.119
-Yeah.

59:51.121 --> 59:52.354
Logan's in preschool.

59:52.356 --> 59:54.756
I babysit him all the time.

59:54.758 --> 59:59.461
Yeah, but just, you know, other peoples' kids.

59:59.463 --> 01:00:02.030
Right.

01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:05.133
Plus, you don't really know Amanda.

01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:06.468
I've met Amanda.

01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:07.603
Yeah.

01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:10.505
She's just, like, super Jewish.

01:00:10.507 --> 01:00:15.377
Like, two sets of plates Jewish.

01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:15.978
OK.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:16.578
OK?

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.412
Yeah.

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:18.146
Cool.

01:00:18.148 --> 01:00:20.282
I get it.

01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:22.150
Um, so I have the night off.

01:00:22.152 --> 01:00:23.118
Right?

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.453
Yeah.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:29.358
Great.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.058
Well, thanks for understanding.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:31.960
Totally.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:34.029
All right.

01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:35.430
See you soon.

01:00:35.432 --> 01:00:37.165
Can you shut the door, please?

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:42.638
Look how big you are.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.905
- So you're gonna go with--
what are you doing?

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:45.474
You're in the driver's seat.

01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:48.410
Your son is driving the car, Meredith.

01:00:48.412 --> 01:00:51.346
Good girl.

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:52.914
Get back here!

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:54.683
Hi.

01:00:57.421 --> 01:00:59.821
Hi, pretty girl.

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:01.323
I got you guys some presents.

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:03.692
You're a princess tonight.

01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:08.363
Some nail polish, and some bracelets, and some candy.

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:09.965
A bunch of fun stuff.

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:12.000
You're gonna be real princesses, huh?

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.336
I'm so sorry I can't be there.

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:15.504
Somebody changed my plans.

01:01:15.506 --> 01:01:16.438
What do you say?

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.406
Thank you.

01:01:17.408 --> 01:01:18.273
Thank you.

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:19.241
You're so welcome.

01:01:19.243 --> 01:01:20.075
Have the best night ever.

01:01:20.077 --> 01:01:21.843
Thanks, McKenna.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:22.878
Bye.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.246
Look at these bracelets!

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:35.290
Hey.

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:36.825
Oh, peanuts.

01:01:36.827 --> 01:01:44.332
Uh, guys are coming around
8:00, so, whenever.

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:46.268
Can I have a chip?

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:47.803
Yeah.

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:51.339
I'll be gone.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:53.041
OK.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.342
Have fun.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.682
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

01:02:00.684 --> 01:02:01.717
What's up, my friend?

01:02:01.719 --> 01:02:03.418
What's going on, my friend?

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.453
Yeah, it's good to see you.

01:02:04.455 --> 01:02:05.287
That case looks so sinister.

01:02:05.289 --> 01:02:06.288
Isn't it?

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:08.156
Well, there's guns in here.

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:09.057
I'm just--

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:10.392
-There's guns in here.

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:11.326
That's gonna be on you, potentially.

01:02:11.328 --> 01:02:12.094
Why?

01:02:12.096 --> 01:02:13.562
You know why.

01:02:13.564 --> 01:02:14.896
-I didn't--

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:16.998
I didn't know that was you.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.034
I cut him off. 'm sorry.

01:02:19.036 --> 01:02:21.136
Are we ready to descend to the gambling house?

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:22.571
Are these fingerlings?

01:02:22.573 --> 01:02:23.805
Rach, are you seeing this?

01:02:23.807 --> 01:02:26.041
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:30.846
So, this is where we will Women and Wine.

01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:32.614
It's very French, right?

01:02:32.616 --> 01:02:34.149
Is that what we're going for here?

01:02:34.151 --> 01:02:36.251
The only thing that's not French, no

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:37.219
kidding, is the piano.

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:40.122
It was my grandfather's--

01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:41.523
-Somebody had a five.

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:43.291
Fuck you.

01:02:43.293 --> 01:02:46.495
So now it's to him, because he's left of the dealer.

01:02:47.498 --> 01:02:48.563
Man, fuck.

01:02:48.565 --> 01:02:50.098
You're betting a million dollars.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:54.669
It should be pronounced "yuca," as in Yucatan.

01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:56.404
- Well, I guess it's in
most tequilas and--

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:02.210
It's 7:59.

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:03.211
7:59.

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:04.813
Can I ask a question?

01:03:04.815 --> 01:03:07.682
Where'd the fuck that fucking ante come from?

01:03:07.684 --> 01:03:12.154
Jennifer's into guys who are approximately 100 pounds

01:03:12.156 --> 01:03:13.188
overweight.

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:16.258
They are full figured women.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.559
Seriously, dude.

01:03:17.561 --> 01:03:18.527
Rachel found her.

01:03:18.529 --> 01:03:20.061
Rachel found her.

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.835
Yeah.

01:03:26.837 --> 01:03:28.703
We should have a toast, ladies.

01:03:28.705 --> 01:03:30.105
OK, let's toast it up.

01:03:30.107 --> 01:03:31.006
We should have a toast!

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:33.408
To long marriages.

01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:34.309
-And long--

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:35.043
-Long marriage!

01:03:35.045 --> 01:03:36.278
And children.

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.246
Cheers.

01:03:38.248 --> 01:03:39.581
Wait, wait, wait.

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:40.582
This is, we have to look each other in the eye.

01:03:40.584 --> 01:03:41.216
What?

01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:41.817
We did.

01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:43.185
We have to go like this.

01:03:43.187 --> 01:03:43.952
This is

01:03:43.954 --> 01:03:45.353
We don't do it.

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:46.054
So make it real.

01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:47.789
OK.

01:03:47.791 --> 01:03:49.090
It's just something she
read in "Real Simple."

01:03:49.092 --> 01:03:51.293
She's making everyone have these moments.

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:52.060
OK.

01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:53.962
I'm sorry, but--

01:03:53.964 --> 01:03:55.030
-I'm so glad.

01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:55.831
Cheers.

01:03:55.833 --> 01:03:57.532
Cheers.

01:03:57.534 --> 01:03:59.201
- But, speaking of which,
if you want to go--

01:03:59.203 --> 01:03:59.835
-Jennie.

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:00.402
Hi.

01:04:00.404 --> 01:04:01.403
Jennie.

01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:02.571
-Speaking of, you want to--

01:04:02.573 --> 01:04:03.605
I'm looking at you.

01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:05.140
No, you need to look at her.

01:04:05.142 --> 01:04:06.141
You need to hold her hand.

01:04:06.143 --> 01:04:08.109
I just looked at her!

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:09.444
Oh my god.

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:36.905
When you get home and you take off those things, there's

01:04:36.907 --> 01:04:40.275
There's no elegant way to pull them off.

01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:41.409
And your whole body just--

01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:43.111
-Pot's getting too good, right?

01:04:43.113 --> 01:04:44.479
Remember you used to be able to smoke a joint?

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:46.514
You smoke your joint now, you die.

01:04:46.516 --> 01:04:47.482
Hi.

01:04:47.484 --> 01:04:49.417
Hello.

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:50.018
Hey.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:50.986
Hi.

01:04:50.988 --> 01:04:52.721
Thought you were going out?

01:04:52.723 --> 01:04:54.656
Oh, I changed my mind.

01:04:54.658 --> 01:04:56.458
Look at this.

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:57.993
You guys need company?

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:01.162
Yeah.

01:05:01.164 --> 01:05:03.498
Yeah, all right.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.733
-There was a thing that--

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:06.268
-Stephanie, why are you not drinking?

01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:08.970
I know that normally I am a borderline alcoholic, but, I

01:05:08.972 --> 01:05:12.307
wasn't gonna tell you guys, I am preggers.

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:15.243
I'm p It was a total surprise.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:16.111
Oh, my god.

01:05:16.113 --> 01:05:17.412
-Yeah, so anyway--

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:19.314
-Oh, my god!

01:05:19.316 --> 01:05:20.982
Amazing.

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:23.518
Oh, you guys are gonna have two kids?

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.686
That's good for me!

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:29.658
Oh my god!

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.559
You're trying to get mad about three.

01:05:31.561 --> 01:05:33.528
Yeah.

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.830
Not me, said Logan.

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:39.067
OK.

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:40.335
Anyway.

01:05:40.337 --> 01:05:40.969
That is awesome.

01:05:40.971 --> 01:05:42.170
Wow.

01:05:42.172 --> 01:05:43.171
Congratulations.

01:05:43.173 --> 01:05:44.606
-That is, I mean--

01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:45.774
-Congratulations.

01:05:45.776 --> 01:05:46.541
Thank you guys, Thank you so much.

01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:47.375
Thank you.

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:47.976
When are you due?

01:05:47.978 --> 01:05:48.944
March.

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:51.446
Wow.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:52.914
Thank you.

01:05:52.916 --> 01:05:54.950
Has anybody here wondered what their aborted children

01:05:54.952 --> 01:05:56.518
would be like?

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:57.552
Oh, my god.

01:05:57.554 --> 01:05:58.954
What is happening right now?

01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:02.590
Have we all not had-- who's
had an abortion here?

01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:03.458
And We've all--

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.159
-Who hasn't?

01:06:04.161 --> 01:06:05.160
Yeah.

01:06:05.162 --> 01:06:06.494
We've all had the abortion.

01:06:06.496 --> 01:06:08.830
I fucked so many people in my 20's, you guys.

01:06:08.832 --> 01:06:10.165
It's like, all I did was fuck people.

01:06:10.167 --> 01:06:11.599
Everybody fucked everybody.

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:12.567
Exactly.

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:13.668
That's why you have 20's.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:14.803
That's why you have your 20's.

01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:16.171
I fucked the shit out of my 20's.

01:06:16.173 --> 01:06:17.505
The 20's are for fucking.

01:06:17.507 --> 01:06:18.873
Thank you!

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:20.208
And they're for asking your parents for money.

01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:23.044
I want to hear about everybody's abortions!

01:06:23.046 --> 01:06:24.446
- Guys, it's not gonna be--
it's not gonna be

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:25.680
a super late night.

01:06:25.682 --> 01:06:27.115
So we should wrap it up.

01:06:27.117 --> 01:06:28.516
Who wants another drink?

01:06:28.518 --> 01:06:29.751
-This is--

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:31.786
-I will, uh, I would love a little bit.

01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:32.921
Thank you, darling.

01:06:32.923 --> 01:06:34.322
I'm gonna go get us some whiskey.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:35.457
I'll see you guys in a minute.

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:36.224
Don't you dare look at my cards.

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:37.192
We will not.

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:38.326
That would never happen.

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:40.128
We will not look at your cards.

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:42.664
Everything but her cards.

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:44.366
Did she just go get us drinks?

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:49.871
She's the best nanny in the world.

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:55.543
So I was a freshman at USC.

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:57.112
Oh, god.

01:06:57.114 --> 01:07:01.182
I was in my first week, and I
was in my dorm room, getting

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:04.319
ready for my sorority rush, because that's what all the

01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:06.621
cool kids were doing.

01:07:06.623 --> 01:07:10.158
And this guy, oh my god, was it Mike or John?

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.127
No names.

01:07:12.129 --> 01:07:12.761
John.

01:07:12.763 --> 01:07:14.095
Mike?

01:07:14.097 --> 01:07:14.896
Where is this going?

01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:16.631
Not anywhere good.

01:07:16.633 --> 01:07:18.967
I fucking don't know his name.

01:07:18.969 --> 01:07:21.236
He just came walking on into my dorm room.

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:22.103
-Anyway, it happened, and--

01:07:22.105 --> 01:07:24.806
didn't even knock on my dorm room door.

01:07:24.808 --> 01:07:26.941
OK, I definitely don't like where this is going.

01:07:26.943 --> 01:07:30.078
Yeah, but he came in, he told me I was pretty.

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:32.614
And made me feel really sorry for him.

01:07:32.616 --> 01:07:33.515
And then he, and then he raped you.

01:07:33.517 --> 01:07:34.549
Started kissing me.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:35.850
Is that where this is going?

01:07:35.852 --> 01:07:39.120
You guys, it's not-- this
is not a rape story!

01:07:39.122 --> 01:07:41.790
It sounds a whole lot like a rape story.

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:44.292
- I literally just like-- that's
what s college is.

01:07:44.294 --> 01:07:45.193
-This is--

01:07:45.195 --> 01:07:46.594
-Nobody asks in college!

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:47.762
Could we just pretend like it's my baby shower?

01:07:47.764 --> 01:07:48.997
I think that's appropriate.

01:07:48.999 --> 01:07:51.666
It wasn't like a stranger, you guys.

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:54.903
We met in the cafeteria.

01:07:54.905 --> 01:07:56.504
Oh, god.

01:07:56.506 --> 01:07:58.640
What is going on with you tonight?

01:07:58.642 --> 01:08:02.544
No, we managed to get through this fucking amazing thing

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:04.212
they used to serve.

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:05.814
Oh, my god.

01:08:05.816 --> 01:08:10.452
It was like this foamy, light
green, whipped jello shit with

01:08:10.454 --> 01:08:11.352
like--

01:08:11.354 --> 01:08:12.120
-Oh, I remember that.

01:08:12.122 --> 01:08:12.987
What was that?

01:08:12.989 --> 01:08:14.389
What was that called?

01:08:14.391 --> 01:08:14.989
Fantasia.

01:08:14.991 --> 01:08:16.591
It's Ambrosia.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:17.425
It was Ambrosia.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:18.960
It was Ambrosia.

01:08:18.962 --> 01:08:20.028
You're doing it.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:21.696
I make that all the time.

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:23.031
You still make it?

01:08:23.033 --> 01:08:25.466
Where do you get the recipe for something like that?

01:08:25.469 --> 01:08:26.401
She got it from her bubba.

01:08:26.403 --> 01:08:27.368
-She just--

01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:28.502
-In my head.

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:29.904
What's your secret?

01:08:29.906 --> 01:08:31.872
Um, there's really no secret.

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:33.308
You just put stuff in it.

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:36.277
It's jello, and then you just add whatever you have.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.011
You know, fruit.

01:08:38.014 --> 01:08:40.515
Nuts.

01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:42.082
You put nuts in the jello?

01:08:42.085 --> 01:08:44.185
You can put nuts in there.

01:08:44.187 --> 01:08:46.520
Cherries.

01:08:46.523 --> 01:08:47.154
Uh--

01:08:47.157 --> 01:08:48.356
-Nuts?

01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:49.890
Yeah.

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:50.725
Oh, stop it.

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:52.060
Would you stop it?

01:08:52.062 --> 01:08:53.528
When you bite down on a piece of jello, you're

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:54.595
not expecting a nut.

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:55.830
That's what I'm saying.

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:58.198
So I got pregnant by this kid.

01:08:58.201 --> 01:08:59.434
Oh, god, we're still on it.

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:01.169
And then I had to go back home to my

01:09:01.171 --> 01:09:02.871
parents' house in Chicago.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.538
Had to go to the local clinic.

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:05.707
Got an abortion!

01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:07.175
Did your parents know?

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:07.908
Yeah.

01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:09.010
My mom knew.

01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:11.645
I had to literally stay home
the rest of my freshman year,

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:12.981
and I missed my Freshman year.

01:09:12.983 --> 01:09:14.282
Didn't even go back to fucking USC, because I

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:16.850
couldn't face that kid.

01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:19.154
Well No!

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:22.189
So I just stayed home on my parents' couch.

01:09:22.192 --> 01:09:26.361
I watched soap operas for a year of my life.

01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:28.129
My god.

01:09:28.131 --> 01:09:29.130
Oh, my god, you guys.

01:09:29.131 --> 01:09:29.964
Soap operas.

01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:31.666
They're gone.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.368
They're all gone.

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:37.538
She has returned!

01:09:37.541 --> 01:09:42.243
She has returned with
beverages and--

01:09:42.245 --> 01:09:43.778
look at those tits too.

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:47.182
Come on!

01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:48.149
There we go!

01:09:48.151 --> 01:09:50.518
All right, there we go!

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.252
There we go!

01:09:51.254 --> 01:09:51.986
All right.

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:55.223
Oh, this is my shit right here, yo.

01:09:55.225 --> 01:09:58.226
This is my jam right here!

01:09:58.228 --> 01:10:01.629
This is my jam right here.

01:10:37.534 --> 01:10:40.301
Coming around the mountain.

01:10:40.303 --> 01:10:44.339
She'll be coming--

01:10:44.341 --> 01:10:45.640
-Hey!

01:10:45.642 --> 01:10:50.211
Have you guys ever had an eyes open orgasm?

01:10:50.213 --> 01:10:50.878
Hello?

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.313
What?

01:10:52.315 --> 01:10:53.615
That was a good segue way.

01:10:53.617 --> 01:10:55.383
Have you guys ever had an eyes open orgasm?

01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:57.151
Wow.

01:10:57.153 --> 01:11:00.955
Do you stare in your husband's eyes, or do you close your

01:11:00.957 --> 01:11:03.791
eyes, and do you think about somebody else?

01:11:03.793 --> 01:11:05.059
Hm!

01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:06.794
What is the question?

01:11:06.796 --> 01:11:08.129
-Do you stare into--

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:11.299
First of all have, I'd have to be like this.

01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:12.033
I'd have to be like--

01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:13.968
-You're doing it right now!

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:14.869
Oh, she only does it from behind!

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:16.204
Yes!

01:11:16.206 --> 01:11:18.139
That's how this happened!

01:11:18.141 --> 01:11:19.874
From behind!

01:11:19.876 --> 01:11:21.409
They'll be coming around--

01:11:21.411 --> 01:11:23.745
-He took you up the caboose.

01:11:23.747 --> 01:11:27.282
No, because then I would be having a butt baby.

01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:28.149
Here's the situation.

01:11:28.151 --> 01:11:30.952
I have a very attractive husband.

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:33.288
I know.

01:11:33.290 --> 01:11:34.455
--we can all get on board for that.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:35.423
Yes.

01:11:35.425 --> 01:11:36.624
-But sometimes a little--

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:37.358
Um, picture the little what's his name.

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.559
Fassbender.

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:43.998
Whatever, I use him.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.334
He's got a huge cock.

01:11:45.335 --> 01:11:46.601
I use him.

01:11:46.603 --> 01:11:48.036
Don't even get me started what's going on.

01:11:48.038 --> 01:11:51.306
Up here is like, uh, is like college professor.

01:11:51.308 --> 01:11:56.477
16th century woman in a corset, uh horse thing.

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:59.547
Oh, that, um, that, uh, Jody Foster

01:11:59.549 --> 01:12:00.748
movie on the pool table.

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:01.916
Oh my god.

01:12:01.918 --> 01:12:03.151
"The Accused."

01:12:03.153 --> 01:12:04.352
-That was--

01:12:04.354 --> 01:12:05.853
Was that a pool table or a juke box?

01:12:05.855 --> 01:12:07.255
It was a pinball.

01:12:07.257 --> 01:12:08.656
I've masturbated to that scene for two decades.

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:10.358
What?

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.492
I think I have to go.

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:12.493
Oh no.

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:13.961
Guys.

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:14.930
Amanda, we're making you feel

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:18.099
Because we're being weird.

01:12:18.101 --> 01:12:20.601
Now it's weird.

01:12:20.603 --> 01:12:21.436
No, no, no, no no, no.

01:12:21.438 --> 01:12:22.570
Amanda, we will--

01:12:22.572 --> 01:12:23.938
We'll talk about something normal.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.206
Amanda, honey, I'm sorry.

01:12:25.208 --> 01:12:26.307
It was up the butt stuff, I think, that

01:12:26.309 --> 01:12:27.475
pushed it over the edge.

01:12:27.477 --> 01:12:28.242
The butt baby?

01:12:28.244 --> 01:12:29.243
The butt baby.

01:12:29.245 --> 01:12:30.578
That's where it took a turn.

01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:31.746
What are you thinking about, kosher Amanda?

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:32.513
Don't press her.

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:33.548
Don't press her.

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:34.782
Rachel.

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:35.416
Holier than thou.

01:12:35.418 --> 01:12:36.250
Rachel.

01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:37.285
Keep the Sabbath.

01:12:37.287 --> 01:12:38.286
Limit your kids' screen time.

01:12:38.288 --> 01:12:39.487
Rachel.

01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:40.521
Do it through a hole in the sheet.

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:41.523
Rachel.

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:43.124
Rachel.

01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:43.958
Invite us all over for your scrapbooking

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.561
Who wants to make a scrapbook?

01:12:46.563 --> 01:12:47.328
Hey.

01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:48.896
Logan is five.

01:12:48.898 --> 01:12:53.468
He's not a baby anymore, and I
never made one photo album.

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:56.437
I never made one photo album, it's gone.

01:12:56.439 --> 01:12:57.839
Honey.

01:12:57.841 --> 01:12:59.407
Make a photo album.

01:12:59.409 --> 01:13:01.476
I remember the photo albums that our moms would make with

01:13:01.478 --> 01:13:04.979
the, like-- the, like,
tape in the--

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:06.180
In the corners.

01:13:06.182 --> 01:13:07.181
I know.

01:13:07.183 --> 01:13:08.950
I love those.

01:13:08.952 --> 01:13:09.550
I know.

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:10.251
I know.

01:13:10.253 --> 01:13:11.486
It's OK.

01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:12.754
And now it's gone.

01:13:12.756 --> 01:13:14.589
Now all of my pictures are on the cloud.

01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:16.157
What is the cloud?

01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:17.458
What the fuck is the cloud?

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:18.993
He's not gonna re--

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:20.762
He's not gonna know how to access his

01:13:20.764 --> 01:13:22.063
pictures when I die.

01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:24.265
When I die, who is gonna tell him who he was

01:13:24.267 --> 01:13:25.199
when he was a baby?

01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:27.101
Who's gonna tell him?

01:13:27.103 --> 01:13:29.604
Who's gonna be there?

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:31.939
How is he gonna get into the cloud?

01:13:31.941 --> 01:13:33.274
What the fuck is the cloud?

01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:37.011
Does anybody here not trust the fucking cloud?

01:13:37.013 --> 01:13:39.147
We're gonna get going.

01:17:11.326 --> 01:17:12.326
Fucking Matt.

01:17:12.328 --> 01:17:14.128
Are you kidding me?

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:17.331
Matthew Jacob, get the fuck up right now.

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:18.332
Jennie, hold on.

01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:18.966
Hold on.

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:20.334
Oh my god.

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:21.235
Matt.

01:17:21.237 --> 01:17:22.303
What did you do to her?

01:17:22.305 --> 01:17:23.904
What'd he do to you?

01:17:23.906 --> 01:17:26.707
Jennie that's her period.

01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:27.942
I have my period.

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:29.276
That's her period.

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:30.311
What agency are you with, honey?

01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:31.345
I'm going to call them.

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:32.346
I need that number right now.

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:33.414
I don't work for an agency.

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:34.281
What?

01:17:34.283 --> 01:17:35.316
Who do you work for?

01:17:35.318 --> 01:17:36.851
I work for myself.

01:17:38.887 --> 01:17:41.689
I'm a whore.

01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:43.224
What did she just say?

01:17:43.226 --> 01:17:44.191
Hang on, hang on.

01:17:44.193 --> 01:17:45.559
She knows.

01:17:45.561 --> 01:17:47.395
She got a lap dance from me.

01:17:47.397 --> 01:17:49.497
He bought me for her.

01:17:49.499 --> 01:17:51.499
He came and paid me.

01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:54.135
Like I was a present.

01:17:54.137 --> 01:17:57.171
We've gone out of our way to try and help you.

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:59.674
McKenna, you needed a place to stay.

01:17:59.676 --> 01:18:02.109
You will never see your children ever again.

01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:03.477
Do you understand that?

01:18:03.479 --> 01:18:04.812
Don't fucking say that to me?

01:18:04.814 --> 01:18:05.713
Jennie.

01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:06.614
Stop.

01:18:06.616 --> 01:18:07.248
Stop for a second, OK?

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:08.783
Stop.

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:14.288
Can we please leave this room?

01:18:14.290 --> 01:18:16.023
I'm so sorry, Jeff.

01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:17.558
Fuck off, Jeff.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.793
You, I am done with.

01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:20.261
She did not do anything to you.

01:18:20.263 --> 01:18:21.796
Oh, I bet you are.

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:53.828
All right, Rachel.

01:18:56.531 --> 01:18:58.065
Do you have somewhere to go?

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:02.136
Yeah, I have like a million places to go.

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:08.075
OK.

01:19:12.948 --> 01:19:14.281
Goodbye.

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:17.752
Yep.

01:20:00.195 --> 01:20:04.031
If we're late for Shabbat, uh, you could just put your

01:20:04.033 --> 01:20:05.966
guitar in your cubby, and then
we'll take it home at the end

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:07.001
of the day, OK?

01:20:07.003 --> 01:20:09.103
OK.

01:20:09.105 --> 01:20:12.039
If you're upset about somebody else playing it, then

01:20:12.041 --> 01:20:14.175
I can just take it home and put it right away.

01:20:14.177 --> 01:20:15.342
OK?

01:20:15.344 --> 01:20:16.243
I don't want anyone else playing it.

01:20:16.245 --> 01:20:17.111
Fine, then we'll just--

01:20:17.113 --> 01:20:18.212
I'll bring it home.

01:20:34.095 --> 01:20:35.095
Mom.

01:20:35.097 --> 01:20:37.064
What are you doing?

01:20:37.066 --> 01:20:38.065
You told me to go.

01:20:38.067 --> 01:20:39.500
I told you to let me go.

01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:40.401
Are you OK?

01:20:40.403 --> 01:20:41.802
No I'm not fucking OK.

01:20:41.804 --> 01:20:44.338
I told you to stop for a second so I could cross.

01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:45.573
I misread your signal.

01:20:45.575 --> 01:20:46.607
You're missing everything these days.

01:20:46.609 --> 01:20:47.341
You miss everything.

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:48.475
-I just--

01:20:48.477 --> 01:20:49.643
I thought you had
said I should--

01:20:49.645 --> 01:20:51.145
-What was she doing in our house?

01:20:51.147 --> 01:20:54.381
I worked so hard to buy us a
beautiful house, and you--

01:20:54.383 --> 01:20:55.783
Did you want me to fuck her?

01:20:55.785 --> 01:20:57.218
Just tell me honestly.

01:20:57.220 --> 01:20:57.818
No.

01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.353
-Is that your ide--

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:00.054
Was that your idea?

01:21:00.056 --> 01:21:01.488
Dad!

01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:02.456
Then what?

01:21:02.458 --> 01:21:04.158
Did you want to fuck her?

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.159
Are you a lesbian?

01:21:05.161 --> 01:21:05.926
Just tell me honestly.

01:21:05.928 --> 01:21:06.560
I won't be mad.

01:21:06.562 --> 01:21:07.361
I am a mother.

01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:08.229
I am a wife.

01:21:08.231 --> 01:21:08.996
I'm a--

01:21:08.998 --> 01:21:11.599
Open the door!

01:21:11.601 --> 01:21:12.566
What, you were curious?

01:21:12.568 --> 01:21:13.300
Daddy!

01:21:13.302 --> 01:21:14.735
-What, you--

01:21:14.737 --> 01:21:15.569
You thought you would learn something from a damaged

01:21:15.571 --> 01:21:16.804
fucking sex--

01:21:16.806 --> 01:21:18.172
OK.

01:21:18.174 --> 01:21:19.139
Tell me what you learned.

01:21:19.141 --> 01:21:20.274
Tell me what you learned!

01:21:20.276 --> 01:21:21.542
I was just trying to help her.

01:21:21.544 --> 01:21:22.576
She didn't know what she was gonna do.

01:21:22.578 --> 01:21:23.711
You were trying to help her?

01:21:23.713 --> 01:21:24.345
You're the one that needs help.

01:21:24.347 --> 01:21:25.179
Not her.

01:21:25.181 --> 01:21:26.447
Well, so help me!

01:21:26.449 --> 01:21:27.648
That's not my job!

01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:29.683
It's not my job to fucking help you.

01:21:29.685 --> 01:21:30.517
Take it easy.

01:21:30.519 --> 01:21:31.285
Just take it easy.

01:21:31.287 --> 01:21:32.553
Listen, Rachel.

01:21:32.555 --> 01:21:33.187
Logan, mommy and daddy are having a talk.

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:33.821
Hold on.

01:21:33.823 --> 01:21:35.389
Mom!

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:36.523
You need something.

01:21:36.525 --> 01:21:37.892
You need to figure out what it is.

01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:40.561
You said you didn't want another kid?

01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:42.496
I was so bored that I thought I was dying.

01:21:42.498 --> 01:21:44.465
Not everyone gets to be happy!

01:21:44.467 --> 01:21:45.633
Well, then quit!

01:21:45.635 --> 01:21:46.867
I never told you to sell Happy Farm.

01:21:46.869 --> 01:21:47.735
I never told you to stay.

01:21:47.737 --> 01:21:49.069
I'm not gonna quit!

01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:50.672
Because I am now in a situation where people are

01:21:50.673 --> 01:21:52.907
depending on me, and that means something to me.

01:21:58.046 --> 01:21:59.280
What do you want?

01:21:59.282 --> 01:22:00.114
What do you want?

01:22:00.116 --> 01:22:03.517
Just tell me.

01:22:03.519 --> 01:22:05.252
I want out.

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:09.556
OK.

01:22:09.558 --> 01:22:11.492
Not out of this marriage, Jeff.

01:22:11.494 --> 01:22:13.093
I want out of this head!

01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:14.094
I want out of this life.

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:15.329
I get it.

01:22:15.331 --> 01:22:16.230
It's fine.

01:22:16.232 --> 01:22:17.631
Your wish is granted.

01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:21.302
I am leaving.

01:22:28.311 --> 01:22:29.176
Come here.

01:22:29.178 --> 01:22:30.044
Come on.

01:22:30.046 --> 01:22:30.911
Come here.

01:22:30.913 --> 01:22:32.012
Come here.

01:22:57.539 --> 01:22:58.205
Hey.

01:22:58.207 --> 01:23:00.240
Hey.

01:23:00.242 --> 01:23:06.513
So, I'm glad I saw you, I really wanted to reach out,

01:23:06.515 --> 01:23:10.217
but I also just wanted to give you your space.

01:23:10.219 --> 01:23:15.089
Also, tell you I'm so sorry.

01:23:15.091 --> 01:23:18.092
You know what, Rachel, I haven't really been living in

01:23:18.094 --> 01:23:20.661
Silver Lake that many years, but where I come from in the

01:23:20.663 --> 01:23:24.732
Palisades woman have each other's backs.

01:23:24.734 --> 01:23:28.836
I think that's why I thought that I could help her.

01:23:28.838 --> 01:23:33.140
OK, Rach, but you had to know better.

01:23:33.142 --> 01:23:38.645
Um, I meant to email you about your room at Big Bear, for

01:23:38.647 --> 01:23:40.114
your family.

01:23:40.116 --> 01:23:42.049
I'm giving it to Amanda's family because, you know, it's

01:23:42.051 --> 01:23:44.418
gonna be awkward for the boy's
this time at the lake without

01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:48.155
their dad, so just kind of have to be really strong for

01:23:48.157 --> 01:23:51.125
them, and I can't really do that if you're there, so.

01:23:57.298 --> 01:23:58.232
Amanda.

01:23:58.234 --> 01:23:58.999
Hey.

01:23:59.001 --> 01:24:01.301
Hi.

01:24:01.303 --> 01:24:04.705
I know I got really drunk the
other night and I know I said

01:24:04.707 --> 01:24:06.640
some pretty awful things.

01:24:06.642 --> 01:24:07.975
I didn't mean to call you--

01:24:07.977 --> 01:24:10.110
-Kosher Amanda.

01:24:10.112 --> 01:24:12.413
I'm actually not kosher.

01:24:12.415 --> 01:24:14.982
Oh, I think I just assumed.

01:24:14.984 --> 01:24:16.417
Sam keeps kosher, but I love to cook.

01:24:16.419 --> 01:24:18.218
I love to cook.

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:21.989
And there are so many things to cook that are not kosher.

01:24:21.991 --> 01:24:25.225
But I do light the candles on Friday nights.

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:27.995
I don't know why that gives me
such a bad rap around here.

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:32.433
Anyway.

01:24:32.435 --> 01:24:33.934
So, I'll see you.

01:24:33.936 --> 01:24:35.269
I'm sorry.

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.740
You've reached Jeff.

01:24:39.742 --> 01:24:40.541
Leave me a message.

01:24:42.778 --> 01:24:44.478
I miss you so much.

01:24:47.749 --> 01:24:49.450
Please come home.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.967
Did that feel better?

01:25:06.969 --> 01:25:08.769
To be a pariah?

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:14.341
I never felt like I fit in with those moms anyway.

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:19.580
I mean, they don't work.

01:25:19.582 --> 01:25:21.115
You don't work either.

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:25.886
I used to want to be a war reporter.

01:25:25.888 --> 01:25:26.854
I remember.

01:25:26.856 --> 01:25:28.188
You do?

01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:30.357
I said that, didn't I?

01:25:30.359 --> 01:25:31.625
Yes, you said it.

01:25:31.627 --> 01:25:34.862
Jeff acts like he doesn't remember.

01:25:34.864 --> 01:25:39.399
Well, if you need evidence, I take copious notes.

01:25:39.401 --> 01:25:41.101
Sure it's in here.

01:25:48.643 --> 01:25:52.112
Jeff has been sleeping in Bo and Stephanie's garage.

01:25:52.114 --> 01:25:56.183
Are you afraid he's going to leave you?

01:25:56.185 --> 01:25:57.518
Yes.

01:25:59.754 --> 01:26:01.889
May I share something?

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:14.368
Portia and I broke up.

01:26:14.370 --> 01:26:15.936
And I know this is inappropriate.

01:26:15.938 --> 01:26:20.607
You know how you can be living with someone and take

01:26:20.609 --> 01:26:23.744
them for granted?

01:26:23.746 --> 01:26:25.846
I did that with her.

01:26:25.848 --> 01:26:31.552
The moment I met her, I said to her, I want to be looking

01:26:31.554 --> 01:26:35.455
at your eyes when I die.

01:26:35.457 --> 01:26:39.526
That is a lot for a first date.

01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:42.396
That was the truth.

01:26:42.398 --> 01:26:44.932
I didn't know what I had when I had it.

01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:51.205
I don't wanna start all over.

01:26:56.478 --> 01:26:59.146
I don't wanna start all over.

01:27:13.329 --> 01:27:14.194
Uh, hey.

01:27:14.196 --> 01:27:15.095
You've reached Jeff.

01:27:37.453 --> 01:27:38.986
Jeff.

01:27:43.024 --> 01:27:44.358
Je--

01:27:51.399 --> 01:27:52.933
Hi.

01:27:59.407 --> 01:28:00.874
Nice digs.

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:07.447
I'm sorry I threw a bomb in the middle of our life.

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:13.020
Our beautiful life.

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:33.206
Does Bo have any weed?

01:29:04.572 --> 01:29:06.306
Oh my god.

01:29:13.481 --> 01:29:15.015
Hey, Rach.

01:29:15.017 --> 01:29:23.017
Um, in my head, I kinda put this
all on you, but I think I

01:29:23.592 --> 01:29:25.826
was asleep, so I'm sorry.

01:29:34.936 --> 01:29:36.770
What day is it?

01:29:36.772 --> 01:29:38.405
Friday.

01:29:38.407 --> 01:29:40.474
Oh, we should light candles.

01:30:22.251 --> 01:30:24.484
What are you saying?

01:30:24.486 --> 01:30:28.688
You have no idea what you're saying, do you?

01:30:28.690 --> 01:30:31.591
You're supposed to cover your eyes.

01:30:31.593 --> 01:30:32.325
That I know.

01:30:32.327 --> 01:30:33.226
Both of us?

01:30:33.228 --> 01:30:34.828
Mhmm.

01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:36.596
OK.

01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:38.131
Eyes are covered.

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:15.702
It's for you.

01:31:15.704 --> 01:31:18.505
I put that together.

01:31:18.507 --> 01:31:20.507
Do you wanna know how long that took?

01:31:20.509 --> 01:31:21.241
No.

01:31:21.243 --> 01:31:22.142
Long time.

01:31:22.144 --> 01:31:23.243
All right, Mr. Giraffe.

01:31:23.245 --> 01:31:24.411
Have a safe trip.

01:31:24.413 --> 01:31:26.079
Don't be too scared.

01:31:26.081 --> 01:31:29.416
Send us a post card!

01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:02.549
I can't believe he didn't talk to her.

01:32:02.551 --> 01:32:03.917
That's crazy.

01:32:03.919 --> 01:32:05.318
There was nothing to say.

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.186
How'd she look?

01:32:06.188 --> 01:32:07.387
She looked good.

01:32:07.389 --> 01:32:08.388
Yeah?

01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:11.324
She looked, well, the same.

01:32:11.326 --> 01:32:12.259
She seems happy.

01:32:12.261 --> 01:32:14.127
Well, that's good.

01:32:14.129 --> 01:32:15.495
Good.

01:32:15.497 --> 01:32:17.497
Still dancing, huh?

01:32:17.499 --> 01:32:19.900
Still hoofing it.

01:32:46.594 --> 01:32:47.361
Hey.

01:32:47.362 --> 01:32:48.495
Hi.

01:32:48.497 --> 01:32:49.429
What's going on?

01:32:49.431 --> 01:32:51.164
What are you up to?

01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:52.465
You wanna meet me at home?

01:32:52.467 --> 01:32:53.667
Uh, yes.

01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:55.835
I'll see you in like seven minutes.

01:32:55.837 --> 01:32:57.571
See you soon.

01:33:03.744 --> 01:33:07.714
We should put Bonnet out.

01:33:07.716 --> 01:33:10.684
Nah, let's let him stay.

01:33:10.686 --> 01:33:14.020
Bonnet, this is how humans do sex.

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:37.177
Faster.

01:33:40.214 --> 01:33:41.615
Look in my eyes.

01:33:41.617 --> 01:33:44.217
Look at me.

01:33:44.219 --> 01:33:45.552
I'm here.
