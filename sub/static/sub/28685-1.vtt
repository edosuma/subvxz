02:40.792 --> 02:41.875
Come here.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.958
Stay in line, Rex. - Sorry, Nelson.

05:53.042 --> 05:55.833
I have to show His Majesty something very important.

05:56.542 --> 05:58.833
Hey! - Be careful, Philip.

06:00.042 --> 06:03.625
Rexy, what a belly.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.083
Over there.

06:08.417 --> 06:10.500
Little pus.

06:10.583 --> 06:12.833
What a terrible villain.

06:13.875 --> 06:16.667
Ever learn good manners?

06:22.167 --> 06:25.958
What can I do about it? That happens if you are the top dog.

06:26.042 --> 06:28.833
Rex, you are incorrigible.

06:28.917 --> 06:33.250
In my time it was not enough to caress, to be the top dog.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.292
Really, Nelson?

06:35.375 --> 06:39.292
I already told you about when I discovered a fire at Windsor Castle

06:39.375 --> 06:42.125
and I saved the royal family?

06:42.208 --> 06:45.417
Only 300 times.

06:46.292 --> 06:49.208
A selfless act of courage.

06:49.292 --> 06:51.750
That is what being a top dog means.

06:51.833 --> 06:55.000
We all know that you are a hero, Nelson,

06:55.583 --> 06:58.250
but could you ever do this?

07:01.833 --> 07:06.458
What an unheard of and irresistible dog.

07:06.542 --> 07:07.625
I do what i can.

07:07.708 --> 07:10.750
Today's dogs! You do not appreciate the happiness that you have.

07:10.833 --> 07:16.458
I am so popular that Her Majesty had my photo put on a mug.

07:17.750 --> 07:20.208
On front pages. - To key chains.

07:20.292 --> 07:21.583
Cards. - Balls.

07:21.667 --> 07:22.958
Flip flops. - Underwear.

07:23.042 --> 07:25.083
Soap, hats, umbrellas.

07:25.167 --> 07:26.458
Brushes in the bathroom.

07:26.542 --> 07:31.333
And best of all, on the royal train.

07:31.417 --> 07:33.208
Really remarkable.

07:35.708 --> 07:38.792
Guys, get ready. We visit a state visit.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.833
Have you had cognac again, Margaret?

07:40.917 --> 07:42.292
No absolutely not.

07:42.875 --> 07:46.125
See, it's the president of the United States.

07:46.208 --> 07:47.208
Let's go.

07:47.292 --> 07:50.292
Wait, we haven't been called yet.

07:50.375 --> 07:53.333
If you are the top dog, you know you are needed.

07:53.417 --> 07:56.125
Maybe we should all go.

08:08.875 --> 08:11.333
Call for the royal corgis.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.467
Let the royal corgis come.

08:13.792 --> 08:15.708
The royal corgis ...

08:16.542 --> 08:18.542
The last one that appears is a fool.

08:23.125 --> 08:25.042
Can someone give me a hand.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.208
You already have one!

08:27.292 --> 08:29.125
I am coming!

08:29.208 --> 08:31.292
Bite the dust, Rex!

08:41.375 --> 08:42.917
Show some ways.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.542
Out of the way! Ladies First.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
Do not look at me. - Not my fault.

08:59.083 --> 09:01.292
We are not. - They are.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.042
Here we are.

09:04.125 --> 09:07.042
What a pleasure to see you, Mr. President.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.250
It really is a wonderful house, Liz.

09:09.333 --> 09:13.625
Yes, it's so ... How do you say it? Discrete.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.833
Man, that corgi is ... ugly.

09:16.917 --> 09:19.125
I already saw nicer behind.

09:19.208 --> 09:22.083
I feel sorry for the person who ends up with that creature.

09:22.167 --> 09:24.625
You are not an oil painting yourself, Nelson.

09:25.875 --> 09:30.833
It is an honor to meet you, ma'am. A royal selfie. Say "cheese."

09:31.375 --> 09:35.833
And who is that beautiful doll?

09:35.917 --> 09:39.792
She is the First Lady, ma'am. - No, I meant the ...

09:40.292 --> 09:44.792
This is our beautiful little dog, Mitzy, Your Majesty.

09:44.875 --> 09:48.417
He is from the great state of Texas.

09:48.833 --> 09:52.250
She is delicious. - We're looking for a partner for her.

09:52.333 --> 09:56.667
The only problem is finding the right dog. We only want the best.

09:57.375 --> 10:00.250
Maybe she likes one of mine.

10:00.333 --> 10:04.042
Linking can help strengthen our "special relationship".

10:04.125 --> 10:06.500
What a great idea!

10:06.583 --> 10:09.000
Come on, Mitzy. Grab a puppy!

10:09.083 --> 10:10.667
Let's see how it goes.

10:11.375 --> 10:13.625
And what do we have here?

10:14.125 --> 10:16.958
He is very old. She is a girl.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.542
Very annoying. - Excuse me?

10:21.208 --> 10:23.250
Nice and cute.

10:26.875 --> 10:31.042
Perfect. - I think she has an eye on this one.

10:31.125 --> 10:35.000
Rexy, you are lucky. We found you a girlfriend.

10:35.833 --> 10:39.250
A girlfriend? - Take me, my wild stallion.

10:39.625 --> 10:43.792
Can't we do a re-evaluation? Charlie, help.

10:44.292 --> 10:48.042
What can I say? It seems that you are the chosen one.

10:48.583 --> 10:52.750
I do like a royal wedding.

10:53.125 --> 10:55.792
I don't want to get saddled with her. She's so ...

10:56.208 --> 10:58.958
Terrifying?

10:59.042 --> 11:00.708
Exactly, Charlie.

11:00.792 --> 11:03.792
Ouch! Careful, that hurts.

11:03.875 --> 11:09.125
# Here comes the bride Here she extends #

11:09.208 --> 11:14.375
What if I say it doesn't interest me? - I don't think she wants to be rejected.

11:14.458 --> 11:16.708
There must be a solution.

11:17.542 --> 11:19.583
Now you're not that arrogant, are you?

11:20.125 --> 11:23.000
Come on, Rex. Your lady is waiting.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.417
Help.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.208
The top dog.

11:41.542 --> 11:44.750
Dad has a very important dinner with Her Elisabetheid,

11:44.833 --> 11:47.208
so be a good girl, okay.

11:47.292 --> 11:52.792
If this little dog makes you upset, come to Daddy. Okay, princess?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.792
We have to go, Donald.

11:55.875 --> 11:59.250
Let's leave the lovebirds alone to get acquainted.

12:04.750 --> 12:07.417
Please, Your Majesty. Please!

12:10.167 --> 12:12.833
Majesty! Please! - Hey!

12:12.917 --> 12:16.417
Hey, little boy, don't complain.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.917
Shall we take a walk?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.667
I already did that today.

12:21.083 --> 12:24.333
What are you waiting for? Come to me.

12:24.417 --> 12:27.500
Maybe another time. We view the agenda.

12:29.042 --> 12:32.417
Someone is helping me! Let me, I really have to go pee!

12:33.583 --> 12:35.608
Mayday, mayday, we have a problem.

12:37.542 --> 12:39.792
Calm down, little dog. - Leave me alone.

12:41.375 --> 12:43.792
Mitzy will take care of you, honey.

12:46.292 --> 12:48.125
I'm sorry, I had no other choice.

12:48.208 --> 12:51.375
You want to play it hard, don't you? I like that.

12:53.667 --> 12:56.000
What's wrong with you, don't you understand?

12:56.083 --> 12:59.375
The "N" and the ...

13:00.917 --> 13:03.208
Majesty! Let me out of here!

13:03.292 --> 13:06.458
Cookie, you only live once.

13:06.792 --> 13:08.167
Your Majesty, help!

13:08.250 --> 13:10.833
It's time to grab you. - What?

13:10.917 --> 13:12.583
You!

13:12.667 --> 13:14.583
Prepare your lips, cowboy!

13:15.083 --> 13:16.667
Help!

13:18.292 --> 13:20.958
Majesty! Please come back!

13:22.208 --> 13:25.333
I agree, I will let my people talk to yours

13:25.417 --> 13:27.958
and you let yours talk to mine

13:28.042 --> 13:30.792
and my people will tell you to disappear.

13:31.167 --> 13:35.125
I hope you are ready for the first kiss. I certainly do.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.708
Oh my God.

13:38.708 --> 13:40.583
What, don't you like me?

13:40.667 --> 13:42.250
Why do you think ...

13:42.792 --> 13:43.958
... something like that?

13:43.965 --> 13:47.901
You choose the hard game, don't you? You can run, but you can't hide.

13:47.917 --> 13:49.083
Bet?

13:49.167 --> 13:51.292
And well, let's play.

13:52.625 --> 13:54.958
I'm coming, sweet cookie.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.333
Wow!

13:58.250 --> 14:00.792
I didn't know the British love for gadgets.

14:01.292 --> 14:05.917
View things from a different perspective: we will be the link of the century.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.833
In short, we can bring two really very powerful brands together.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.417
It will be something huge.

14:12.875 --> 14:16.292
I like to play hide and seek. We are made for each other.

14:16.375 --> 14:19.583
Rexy, puppy, where are you?

14:19.667 --> 14:23.125
It's getting warmer here. I can feel it.

14:23.208 --> 14:25.500
I would say in every respect.

14:25.833 --> 14:27.792
And you must be the top dog?

14:27.875 --> 14:31.958
You hide like a little kitty. Meow, meow.

14:33.167 --> 14:34.667
Found it!

14:41.125 --> 14:42.667
Bye!

14:56.792 --> 14:59.375
Royal selfie! Say "cheese"!

15:01.833 --> 15:03.833
Let me out!

15:04.875 --> 15:07.000
Do you want to play it that way?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.375
Wild horses can do everything I come from.

15:16.458 --> 15:19.583
Hold on. The dance begins!

15:29.917 --> 15:31.542
You are not bad,

15:31.590 --> 15:34.715
but let's see if you can fly, my lovebird.

16:07.958 --> 16:12.167
What qualities did the president attract you to?

16:12.250 --> 16:17.542
I would say his thick hair and big hands that are not bad at all.

16:17.625 --> 16:19.833
Dinner is served.

16:19.917 --> 16:24.292
I pass. I hate raw meat. - You call this British humor, don't you?

16:24.375 --> 16:26.583
Sorry madam...

16:34.042 --> 16:37.000
Foot play, huh? - Excuse me?

16:37.083 --> 16:41.875
Tell me, Mr. President, what do you think about English food?

16:41.958 --> 16:43.958
Really amazing.

16:53.958 --> 16:55.625
Mr. President!

16:58.875 --> 17:03.167
I'm afraid this is yours, Your Majesty.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.833
This time you really got into trouble.

17:16.916 --> 17:21.125
You were disobedient. Ripped in!

17:38.875 --> 17:40.542
Are you all right, Rex?

17:40.792 --> 17:43.708
I don't think I'm the top dog of Her Majesty.

17:43.792 --> 17:47.833
Of course you still are. Nothing will ever change that.

17:47.917 --> 17:49.292
I've ruined everything.

17:49.375 --> 17:52.583
The president canceled his visit and returned to America.

17:52.667 --> 17:57.125
I understand you don't like the situation, but what did you do to her?

17:57.208 --> 18:01.667
Not her, him. - That creature is a he?

18:01.750 --> 18:03.167
No, the president.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.167
The president? What happened?

18:05.250 --> 18:10.125
I bit the president in his lower parts. I am the shame of the royal family.

18:10.625 --> 18:13.417
Well, in that case ...

18:13.792 --> 18:15.875
Maybe I should leave.

18:15.958 --> 18:18.333
Where can you go? - No idea.

18:20.208 --> 18:23.333
What about the pope's house? - The pope?

18:23.667 --> 18:26.250
I think he would like to have a puppy

18:26.333 --> 18:29.000
walking around Vatican City. What do you think of it, Rex

18:30.292 --> 18:33.292
Do you know what, Charly? I like it!

18:34.208 --> 18:36.458
Really? - Sure.

18:36.917 --> 18:40.708
It can be you and me on your way in an awesome adventure.

18:40.792 --> 18:43.250
On to the papal palace. - When can we go?

18:43.333 --> 18:45.750
No better time than the present!

18:46.125 --> 18:49.208
Your Holiness, we are coming.

18:52.292 --> 18:54.125
I'm so excited.

18:54.208 --> 18:55.833
I can not help it.

19:07.542 --> 19:11.417
Plague of a dog! Swiping my slipper.

19:33.375 --> 19:36.917
What are you doing? - I have an idea.

20:05.417 --> 20:06.667
<i> But what ... </ i></i>

20:10.167 --> 20:12.042
Sergeant!

20:12.125 --> 20:15.583
We have an emergency situation! - Be careful, this is priceless!

20:25.917 --> 20:30.458
We have to get those bushes. - I'm starting to change my mind, Charlie.

20:30.708 --> 20:35.167
It is quite fresh outside and there is royal jelly for breakfast.

20:41.333 --> 20:43.542
Can't we go tomorrow?

20:48.417 --> 20:49.708
Fast!

20:56.375 --> 20:58.167
Did you hear that? - What, Sergeant?

21:00.083 --> 21:04.250
Must be a fox. I see nothing with this hat.

21:15.208 --> 21:17.542
Take off your collar now.

21:17.625 --> 21:20.917
But the queen gave it to me when she made me a top dog.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.208
Exactly. Everyone will know who you are.

21:24.292 --> 21:27.333
You don't get 5 meters away. - Good thinking.

21:27.792 --> 21:30.208
The pope is going to love you, Charlie.

21:30.292 --> 21:32.583
How are we going to get over that wall?

21:32.667 --> 21:36.583
I know a way. They did work for the cable television.

21:37.500 --> 21:38.875
Come on.

21:44.542 --> 21:46.625
It's tight, but we can squeeze through it.

21:46.708 --> 21:50.583
Have you done it yet? You never said you were outside.

21:50.875 --> 21:53.708
Maybe once or twice. A little fun, you know.

21:53.792 --> 21:56.458
You're a crazy horse, shoot the dog.

21:56.542 --> 22:00.208
There are many things you don't know about me, Rex.

22:19.625 --> 22:21.583
Rex, this way! Fast!

22:23.625 --> 22:26.958
We're going to get caught. - Not if we keep running.

22:27.042 --> 22:28.667
Quick, that way.

22:59.125 --> 23:03.667
We made it! - It's amazing, we're still whole.

23:04.625 --> 23:06.000
Where are we?

23:06.583 --> 23:08.083
Is this Vatican City?

23:08.750 --> 23:11.542
No, it's St. James's Park.

23:16.083 --> 23:20.042
We are being watched. Are there ghosts here?

23:20.125 --> 23:23.500
No, keep walking. You must have seen geese. They are everywhere.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.708
Do you mind if I whistle? - Yes, keep quiet.

23:32.292 --> 23:34.042
Quick, along here!

23:40.333 --> 23:43.708
Charlie, I don't like being out of here.

23:43.792 --> 23:46.083
It is frightening. - Ah, shut up, Rex.

23:46.167 --> 23:48.125
Don't act like an immature puppy.

23:49.083 --> 23:51.375
Charlie, I really want to go back home.

23:51.458 --> 23:54.158
I know I behaved like a spoiled kid.

23:54.165 --> 23:56.456
But we should never have left the palace.

23:56.467 --> 23:58.375
I fear that going back is impossible.

23:58.792 --> 24:02.583
The queen loves me. I know I ruined it, I know it

24:02.667 --> 24:05.042
but she forgives me. I'm sure of it.

24:05.125 --> 24:08.167
I'm her top dog. - Not anymore.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.042
What are you talking about?

24:10.125 --> 24:13.542
You had your chance, now it's my turn.

24:16.833 --> 24:20.750
I was destined to be a top dog

24:20.833 --> 24:24.042
until you showed up.

24:24.125 --> 24:26.458
Charlie, have you gone insane?

24:27.625 --> 24:29.708
I greet you, deceiver!

24:33.792 --> 24:36.000
Charlie, I'm freezing!

24:36.542 --> 24:38.000
I know!

24:38.667 --> 24:41.417
Charlie, you betrayed me!

24:50.417 --> 24:52.792
Goodbye, Mr. Top Dog.

25:32.833 --> 25:35.625
Damn, this must be paradise.

25:56.333 --> 25:57.833
Yes.

26:01.708 --> 26:04.500
Heaven. I do as well as you do.

26:04.583 --> 26:08.667
Breathing is normal and there is no damage to the internal organs.

26:08.750 --> 26:12.458
My stomach kittens! You spoil me, Your Majesty.

26:13.208 --> 26:16.750
Frozen places there. It seems fine.

26:16.833 --> 26:21.083
A suppository to strengthen the immune system and he will be fine.

26:21.167 --> 26:24.792
Yes, give me the full treatment.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.083
You have just exceeded the limit.

26:27.167 --> 26:31.167
Well, you are in perfect condition. - You are not Her Majesty.

26:31.250 --> 26:34.083
No collar, no chip. He will be a wanderer.

26:35.208 --> 26:37.583
I am lucky to have found you.

26:37.833 --> 26:42.708
Let's see if we can find a place for you. The kennel is full.

26:46.625 --> 26:49.958
Good morning, Ginger, do you have room for a guest?

26:50.750 --> 26:52.333
A corgi?

26:52.750 --> 26:57.000
You don't see that often. - I wonder what happened to him.

26:57.083 --> 26:58.083
Who knows?

26:58.167 --> 27:01.542
There are many owners today who are irresponsible.

27:01.625 --> 27:03.250
This is absolutely true.

27:03.333 --> 27:05.208
Well, I have to go now.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.083
See you later.

27:07.167 --> 27:10.667
You look familiar. Have you been here before?

27:14.125 --> 27:15.292
Maybe not.

27:15.375 --> 27:19.458
We are looking for a good roommate. One that has been here a bit longer.

27:21.458 --> 27:23.500
I don't know what you have in mind

27:23.583 --> 27:26.833
but you must take me straight to the palace, my good man,

27:26.917 --> 27:30.167
before my disappearance appears in the national newspapers.

27:30.583 --> 27:34.917
I also have to settle a bill with that filthy Charlie.

27:35.250 --> 27:36.833
Okay, come on.

27:39.750 --> 27:42.000
Where are we going? The exit is the other way.

27:49.375 --> 27:52.958
Who is that cute puppy?

27:56.875 --> 27:58.700
Here we are, little one.

27:58.710 --> 28:02.919
Take me back home, my good man, or you can say goodbye to knighthood.

28:02.925 --> 28:04.917
Jack and the boss will take care of you.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.417
I don't belong in a cage, I am the queen's corgi.

28:08.500 --> 28:11.292
It is dognapping. When the queen finds out,

28:11.667 --> 28:13.083
are you in dirty papers.

28:13.458 --> 28:17.750
Can it be a little less loud, yes? It is Sunday and I want to sleep.

28:17.833 --> 28:20.917
Excuse me? Do you know who I am?

28:21.000 --> 28:24.333
Your head does not ring a bell. Boss?

28:25.917 --> 28:29.125
He also has no idea. - For information,

28:29.458 --> 28:31.958
I am Rex, the top dog of the queen.

28:32.250 --> 28:36.000
Yes? And I am Napoleon, emperor of France.

28:36.083 --> 28:38.917
And he's Katniss Everdeen from the Hunger Games.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.083
Seriously, I'm from the palace. - Did you hear it?

28:43.500 --> 28:47.417
We have a royal visit. - You don't believe me, do you?

28:47.500 --> 28:50.583
You can call yourself Lady GaGa if you want, mate,

28:50.958 --> 28:52.875
but not sing while i sleep. Thanks.

28:52.958 --> 28:55.083
You really are a brutal street punk.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.542
My name is Jack.

28:56.625 --> 28:59.750
Someone has to teach you the rules of the kennel

28:59.833 --> 29:02.000
and that person is me.

29:05.375 --> 29:08.583
Rule one: do not wake sleeping dogs.

29:09.875 --> 29:11.250
Rule two ... - Ouch!

29:11.333 --> 29:14.208
Keep your snout away from eating other dogs.

29:16.833 --> 29:19.458
Rule three: Fight Club does not exist.

29:19.750 --> 29:21.625
What is Fight Club? - What?

29:21.917 --> 29:23.125
The Fight Club. What is it?

29:23.208 --> 29:26.417
It does not exist. - Then why did you call it?

29:26.500 --> 29:29.083
Not me. - He said "Fight Club", right?

29:30.750 --> 29:32.625
You see? - You are weird.

29:32.708 --> 29:35.042
Rule four ... - Leave the education like that.

29:35.583 --> 29:38.208
I'll be out of this hellhole in a day.

29:38.917 --> 29:41.708
Rule four: newcomers sleep on the floor.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.542
The breakfast, everyone.

29:51.625 --> 29:55.250
The smoked herring in whiskey for you, Lady Margaret.

29:55.333 --> 29:58.042
English breakfast for Nelson.

29:58.375 --> 30:02.083
Charlie's cooked calves, of course.

30:02.167 --> 30:08.667
And the classic pizza with a layer of royal jelly for you. Rex?

30:09.042 --> 30:10.750
Rex? Rex!

30:10.833 --> 30:13.500
God, where is he? Rex!

30:13.958 --> 30:15.125
Rex!

30:15.208 --> 30:17.708
Where are you, Rex?

30:24.875 --> 30:26.042
Help.

30:30.750 --> 30:31.750
What is it?

30:33.500 --> 30:38.167
I'm sorry I was a little grumpy earlier. Early in the morning too. How are you?

30:38.250 --> 30:40.875
Terrible. Really bad.

30:40.958 --> 30:42.833
Her Majesty should already be here.

30:42.917 --> 30:45.958
I'm sure she forgave me. - Head up, mate.

30:46.042 --> 30:48.042
Rule five: all dogs,

30:48.125 --> 30:52.583
almost all dogs find a new home within a month.

30:52.667 --> 30:55.208
A beautiful dog, like you, won't last long.

30:55.292 --> 30:58.792
Today is open day for the public. Maybe you are lucky.

30:58.875 --> 31:01.458
That said, many of us like it here.

31:01.750 --> 31:05.667
We have nice bedrooms and three meals a day. You know, three!

31:05.750 --> 31:10.125
No, I don't understand and I don't want a new home.

31:10.208 --> 31:15.500
I want to go back to Buckingham Palace. - It doesn't help everyone.

31:15.583 --> 31:19.750
But if you really are who you say you are, how did you end up here?

31:20.583 --> 31:24.958
I ruined it and was betrayed by my best friend.

31:25.042 --> 31:27.250
We've heard that already, haven't we, boss?

31:29.125 --> 31:31.458
He has never spoken since I have been here.

31:31.542 --> 31:36.042
Is it quiet waters have deep soils, or do silent soils have deep waters?

31:36.125 --> 31:38.667
He was saved by animal protection.

31:38.750 --> 31:43.375
His bosses made him starve. They took his soul out of him.

31:43.458 --> 31:46.750
Disgusting. - Yes, it's the destiny of us all.

31:46.833 --> 31:49.833
We were all rejected by someone.

31:50.583 --> 31:52.917
Open to the public. Give the best of yourself!

31:53.000 --> 31:55.917
Here we go, it's visitor time!

32:03.250 --> 32:05.042
Choose me!

32:06.417 --> 32:08.500
We are a family of trained dogs.

32:08.583 --> 32:11.875
Gentle with children, good with cats, a parrot friend.

32:11.958 --> 32:13.750
A rabbit can play with me!

32:13.833 --> 32:16.667
I never pee on the couch, I promise.

32:18.875 --> 32:20.500
Give us a chance!

32:26.417 --> 32:27.917
Majesty!

32:28.000 --> 32:30.333
It's your top dog, Rex!

32:33.333 --> 32:36.333
Is she already there? Wow! What a luck!

32:36.417 --> 32:41.542
Take me back to Buckingham Palace in the Bentley, my beloved and only queen.

32:44.208 --> 32:48.375
That is not a queen. - I'm not so sure about that.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.667
She's never gonna come.

32:50.750 --> 32:54.667
Don't choose him. He does not know the difference between "apport" and "sitting".

32:54.750 --> 32:55.958
And he won't go.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.333
Get out of the way, Rex!

32:59.083 --> 33:00.917
I think he likes me!

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
Yes Yes Yes!

33:03.083 --> 33:06.667
He can't take his eyes off me. Maybe it's my lucky day.

33:06.750 --> 33:09.083
Today I'm leaving here!

33:15.208 --> 33:16.917
Don't go, young master!

33:17.000 --> 33:20.417
This will not happen again, please. I'm a good dog.

33:20.500 --> 33:23.292
I only have a bladder the size of a bean.

33:24.625 --> 33:27.000
I can not believe it.

33:27.083 --> 33:29.750
I was so close and I ruined it.

33:30.333 --> 33:35.083
You know, friend, in the end you are just like us. They don't want us.

33:35.167 --> 33:37.542
I'm the queen's top dog.

33:37.625 --> 33:39.458
I'm not like you at all.

33:40.792 --> 33:43.042
Rexy! Come on, boy!

33:43.125 --> 33:46.792
Mama will give you a lot of royal jelly. - Rex!

33:46.875 --> 33:49.125
Rex! - Rex!

33:49.208 --> 33:52.750
For God's sake stop that nonsense. Show yourself.

33:53.042 --> 33:54.292
Rex!

33:54.792 --> 33:55.833
Come here!

33:56.542 --> 33:58.542
Come on, boy. - Rex!

33:58.792 --> 34:00.667
Rex!

34:01.917 --> 34:04.042
Unfortunately nothing found, Majesty.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.667
Keep searching. He can't be far away.

34:06.958 --> 34:08.750
Here we go again.

34:08.833 --> 34:13.250
That vagabond is probably after a rabbit somewhere in the park.

34:14.375 --> 34:17.292
Forget Rex anyway. It is almost lunch time and I am hungry.

34:17.750 --> 34:18.833
Rex!

34:19.167 --> 34:23.500
Rex, where are you? Where are you, Rex? Where are you?

34:35.750 --> 34:38.167
Charlie, what did you find?

34:40.250 --> 34:42.417
Rex his golden collar!

34:42.750 --> 34:44.250
No!

34:44.333 --> 34:46.458
He was eaten ...

34:47.375 --> 34:49.042
... foxes.

34:49.333 --> 34:52.833
Damn vermin! I'm taking my gun!

34:52.917 --> 34:55.167
It's too late, Philip.

34:55.458 --> 34:56.875
He is dead.

34:58.917 --> 35:00.667
Poor Charlie.

35:00.750 --> 35:03.375
Rex was your best friend.

35:19.750 --> 35:21.125
Who is that?

35:22.625 --> 35:25.917
That big guy is Bernard, the Saint Bernard.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.583
He was one of the most talented actors in the country.

35:28.667 --> 35:32.208
His career went well, but then he had a stomach problem.

35:32.292 --> 35:34.750
No, I meant him.

35:36.042 --> 35:37.833
He is already.

35:37.917 --> 35:40.625
He was the best drug dog at Heathrow Airport.

35:40.875 --> 35:42.333
Then he exaggerated a bit.

35:45.833 --> 35:47.125
Do you understand me, yes?

35:47.208 --> 35:50.708
No, I was talking about him. What is happening?

35:51.292 --> 35:54.000
Sit back and watch.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.667
What's going on here?

36:36.250 --> 36:38.417
Follow me. - He's fantastic.

36:38.500 --> 36:43.375
But if going out is so easy, why don't you just walk away?

36:43.458 --> 36:47.625
England in the winter? You freeze outside, mate.

36:47.708 --> 36:49.583
I'm not afraid of a little cold.

36:49.667 --> 36:53.000
Go ahead then. The exit is there.

36:53.083 --> 36:56.917
I hope you know the way around the city, it's a big and dangerous place.

36:57.833 --> 37:00.042
The queen will come, I am sure.

37:01.208 --> 37:02.750
Where are you going, Jack?

37:02.833 --> 37:04.208
To the Fight Club.

37:04.292 --> 37:06.208
I thought there was no Fight Club.

37:06.833 --> 37:08.417
Wait for me, Jack!

37:33.208 --> 37:37.292
Welcome. It will be another night for the Fight Club,

37:37.750 --> 37:41.542
the largest illegal theater for immigrants in the city of London,

37:42.542 --> 37:47.875
where only the brave die young and the strong survive.

37:49.208 --> 37:51.500
Get ready for the first round.

37:51.583 --> 37:54.875
Tonight will be a great competition for you.

37:55.167 --> 37:56.583
Who is that "muscle bundle"?

37:56.667 --> 37:59.083
Tyson, a pit bull terrier.

37:59.167 --> 38:02.625
It was a champion fighting dog until he was left behind.

38:02.708 --> 38:05.917
Rule six: never step on Tyson's toes.

38:07.917 --> 38:09.833
The program for tonight.

38:09.917 --> 38:13.583
Boxer, the boxer, is in the red corner.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.708
He will face a rebel,

38:21.792 --> 38:23.958
the doberman cross.

38:25.958 --> 38:30.083
Bidding on Boxer is two to one. I do not accept lower bets.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.333
Here we do what Tyson says. He is the top dog here.

38:35.417 --> 38:38.958
Hey, boss, when are you going out on the field to fight?

38:39.042 --> 38:40.833
A big dog like you!

38:43.042 --> 38:46.875
But first the supporting program.

38:46.958 --> 38:51.167
Applause for the vain, wandering Wanda!

39:05.167 --> 39:06.708
Hello, big boy.

39:28.875 --> 39:33.000
Forget it, she's Tyson's girlfriend. - Just because she hasn't met me yet,

39:38.458 --> 39:39.500
My dear boy.

39:53.542 --> 39:55.667
Rex, you are drooling.

39:59.125 --> 40:00.708
Enough!

40:02.750 --> 40:06.333
Calm down, doggies. The betting is closed.

40:06.417 --> 40:09.125
Are you ready, Boxer? Rebel?

40:10.083 --> 40:12.500
That the battle begins.

40:17.917 --> 40:19.250
I can't watch.

40:19.792 --> 40:22.025
It is terrible. # How to finish my dog? "

40:22.108 --> 40:25.542
It is absolutely awful to imagine what the foxes did to him.

40:25.833 --> 40:28.125
We have to give him a worthy burial.

40:28.208 --> 40:31.917
I fear there is nothing left to be buried.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.858
It doesn't matter, I would do the same for you, Philip.

40:35.125 --> 40:38.792
Pretty reassuring.

40:40.708 --> 40:43.958
I wonder how he ended up in that state. - I do not know.

40:44.042 --> 40:46.583
Shared a cage with a Chihuahua.

40:49.083 --> 40:52.458
You're up early, Rex. - I've been awake for hours.

40:52.542 --> 40:55.083
I was thinking about last night. - You'll get used to it.

40:55.167 --> 40:58.250
The fights aren't that bad. - I'm not talking about the fights.

40:58.583 --> 41:02.458
I thought about Wanda. She is hot. - Do you want my advice?

41:02.542 --> 41:04.000
Forget her.

41:04.083 --> 41:08.042
I would like to, but she has me on the hook and brings me in.

41:08.125 --> 41:10.250
You have no chance, mate.

41:10.333 --> 41:12.333
On the contrary, my friend.

41:12.417 --> 41:16.292
No woman can resist a fine breeding line.

41:17.917 --> 41:20.583
The breakfast! Breakfast is served, boys.

41:21.583 --> 41:23.625
Breakfast is ready.

41:31.333 --> 41:33.983
Do not look at me like that. I tried to tell him.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.708
I know, he's insane.

41:49.333 --> 41:52.083
Miss Wanda, may I introduce myself.

41:52.167 --> 41:56.000
My name is Rex and I am a corgi of the noblest origin.

41:56.083 --> 41:59.208
Yes? - Forgive my inadequate ways,

41:59.292 --> 42:03.333
but I must confess that I am seduced by your beautiful dog charm.

42:03.417 --> 42:05.750
Why do I always get the crazy boilers?

42:05.755 --> 42:08.715
Maybe we can get to know each other during breakfast.

42:08.722 --> 42:10.822
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.

42:12.042 --> 42:14.333
Certainly not worthy of a Michelin star,

42:14.417 --> 42:16.750
but to get to know each other it is acceptable.

42:18.125 --> 42:19.500
He is dead.

42:19.583 --> 42:22.542
If Tyson sees you eating from his bowl, you die.

42:22.625 --> 42:24.708
Come on, my dear. He will bend over

42:24.792 --> 42:28.042
as soon as he knows that I am the top dog of the queen.

42:28.125 --> 42:31.250
You're really crazy, aren't you? - It's all because of you, darling.

42:31.333 --> 42:35.875
Sooner or later I will leave this house and take you.

42:37.167 --> 42:39.833
Excuse me, I'm talking to a lady.

42:40.333 --> 42:42.167
No, you are disturbed, curious!

42:42.250 --> 42:44.875
Where was I? Of course!

42:44.958 --> 42:47.875
I'm taking you to a life

42:47.958 --> 42:52.208
with velvet cushions and footmen serving royal pudding.

42:53.542 --> 42:56.917
Hang on, bully, or I'll give you a good lesson.

42:57.708 --> 42:58.917
No!

42:59.000 --> 43:01.750
Tyson, don't hurt him. And a little dog, a little crazy.

43:04.792 --> 43:08.208
This is not a dog, he is a kid.

43:11.042 --> 43:12.167
Yes.

43:16.250 --> 43:19.167
I told you not to bother with stray dogs, Rex.

43:19.250 --> 43:21.417
Especially if they go with Tyson.

43:21.500 --> 43:24.625
You all saw what happened, Wanda took my defense.

43:25.333 --> 43:27.250
More or less.

43:27.333 --> 43:29.750
Listen, Rex, you must forget about her.

43:30.167 --> 43:33.292
She is really hot, but you are only getting yourself into trouble.

43:33.875 --> 43:37.292
Where did it go wrong? I gave her my best sentences.

43:37.375 --> 43:39.250
Get it out of your head, dude.

43:41.333 --> 43:44.833
If you ever plan to do it again, remember one thing.

43:44.917 --> 43:48.250
We don't know you. - I understand.

43:59.125 --> 44:01.458
Thank you very much, but I don't drink coffee.

44:02.792 --> 44:06.083
Rex, top queen dog.

44:06.167 --> 44:07.983
He certainly spoke the truth.

44:07.989 --> 44:09.185
Hey you!

44:09.195 --> 44:11.881
We're going better. Tyson is never far away.

44:12.375 --> 44:15.375
Good luck, Rex. Put your best foot forward.

44:15.458 --> 44:18.417
I'm already afraid of that. - Go away, losers!

44:18.750 --> 44:22.000
Not you, Your Royal Highness.

44:22.333 --> 44:24.792
Excuse me? - Sorry for earlier.

44:24.875 --> 44:28.792
Tyson is very jealous. - He almost broke my back.

44:28.875 --> 44:30.083
No!

44:30.167 --> 44:32.875
True? Here? - A little further down.

44:32.958 --> 44:34.125
Here? - Yes.

44:34.208 --> 44:37.333
And what about here? - You have the place!

44:37.417 --> 44:39.958
You know, I find you very attractive, Rex.

44:40.042 --> 44:42.833
You have a noble attitude,

44:43.167 --> 44:45.875
strong teeth,

44:46.542 --> 44:49.833
cuddly belly - I try to take care of myself.

44:49.917 --> 44:53.208
A girl would love you.

44:53.292 --> 44:55.917
Really? - Is not it clear?

44:56.000 --> 44:59.208
I have loved you since the first moment I saw you.

44:59.292 --> 45:02.708
At the Fight Club? - Right. You were on the right.

45:02.792 --> 45:04.375
To the left. - All right.

45:04.458 --> 45:06.167
Your left side.

45:06.250 --> 45:08.167
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

45:08.250 --> 45:10.333
You are the dog of my dreams, Rex.

45:10.667 --> 45:13.792
You entered my life and you turned it upside down.

45:14.250 --> 45:17.125
That's what you did with me, Wanda. Literally.

45:17.208 --> 45:20.333
Is Buckingham Palace still valid?

45:20.417 --> 45:22.167
For you, Wanda, everything.

45:23.708 --> 45:25.458
You made me so happy.

45:25.542 --> 45:27.317
I want to tell the whole world!

45:27.327 --> 45:31.052
No, it's better not to do that. You know what Tyson is like. Rex?

45:31.708 --> 45:34.042
Rex! - Go for it, boys.

45:45.500 --> 45:48.042
What if Tyson sees us?

45:54.083 --> 45:56.000
Do you want to dance, my lady?

45:56.083 --> 45:57.625
I'd rather not do that.

46:08.708 --> 46:11.875
Wanda, we are meant to be together.

46:11.958 --> 46:13.542
Really?

46:23.500 --> 46:26.958
Do you want to get married in St. Paul's Cathedral or Westminster Abbey?

46:27.542 --> 46:30.333
I told you to stay away from my wife.

46:30.417 --> 46:31.875
And I told you to screw up.

46:31.958 --> 46:34.458
I'm not done here yet.

46:34.542 --> 46:36.542
Help me, help!

47:02.583 --> 47:03.667
Idiot.

47:04.875 --> 47:08.542
With that you have just joined the Fight Club.

47:20.833 --> 47:22.333
<i> Dear Rexy ... </ i></i>

47:23.292 --> 47:27.792
gone forever. - A bit happier, lady.

47:27.875 --> 47:30.125
It was just an instigator ...

47:30.250 --> 47:31.958
Shut up, Philip.

47:48.000 --> 47:52.167
You're upset too. Don't you, Charlie?

47:56.500 --> 48:00.250
Do you want to be my new top dog?

48:08.292 --> 48:10.375
Where are you taking me?

48:10.458 --> 48:13.375
In the laundry room so that Boxer cannot defeat you.

48:16.125 --> 48:19.500
What does that mean? - That means you have to learn the basics.

48:19.583 --> 48:21.167
You can use all help.

48:21.250 --> 48:25.125
The Boxer record is 76 matches with 75 knockouts.

48:25.583 --> 48:28.250
He can prepare himself well for the 76th.

48:28.333 --> 48:31.667
He didn't knock out, he knocked them out.

48:31.750 --> 48:33.250
He only had one defeat.

48:33.333 --> 48:37.333
Okay, then I have a chance.

48:37.583 --> 48:40.375
He lost to Tyson, Rex.

48:40.617 --> 48:43.667
He's gonna kill me. - Maybe you will get away with a slight intoxication.

48:43.750 --> 48:45.958
You have to take a sedative, man.

48:46.708 --> 48:48.083
Try to relax.

48:48.917 --> 48:51.750
Maybe I can help you.

48:51.833 --> 48:54.625
I did my own stunts when I was younger.

48:54.708 --> 48:57.458
You should learn to roll with the punches,

48:57.542 --> 49:01.292
find an opening and hit it like a rolled-up cobra.

49:01.375 --> 49:06.250
Do you remember the old movie "Rocky"? In the end the underdog won.

49:06.792 --> 49:08.333
Rocky lost, Bernard.

49:08.417 --> 49:10.375
"Rocky II"!

49:11.333 --> 49:14.500
Consider yourself a lucky person. You have the best coach team there is.

49:14.583 --> 49:16.000
I just want to survive.

49:16.083 --> 49:18.708
Okay, let's start with a basic exercise.

49:18.792 --> 49:20.983
Jump in. Show me that you can perform.

50:46.125 --> 50:47.708
It will never work.

50:47.792 --> 50:50.625
Shall I give some acting lessons on how to play dead?

50:50.708 --> 50:54.292
We need a real plan B, Bernard. Follow me.

50:55.917 --> 50:59.875
I carefully examined the layout of this place. Boxer is quite heavy.

50:59.958 --> 51:02.417
Like Bernard said, you have to find an opening.

51:02.500 --> 51:04.917
<i> And ... </i> - Run and hide.

51:14.417 --> 51:16.583
It's Fight Club time.

51:16.667 --> 51:21.792
Not yet. Do not move. As a royal corgi, I ask you not to open the door.

51:21.875 --> 51:24.667
She's already open. What's wrong with you?

51:24.750 --> 51:27.833
Leave him alone. I'm taking over.

51:27.917 --> 51:30.208
He has a stage fever. Come on, Rex.

51:30.292 --> 51:33.083
I can't bear the sight of blue blood.

51:33.167 --> 51:36.083
Calm down, it will be over before you know it.

51:36.292 --> 51:38.417
Be strong, Rex. I believe in you.

51:38.500 --> 51:39.792
Thank you, Wanda.

51:43.875 --> 51:46.833
Well, look who's coming in.

51:46.917 --> 51:49.958
I started thinking you wouldn't show up.

51:50.042 --> 51:56.542
Ladies and gentlemen, give a warm welcome to our royal prey.

52:04.375 --> 52:09.000
Today I bet three to one that the corgi will last for less than a minute.

52:09.083 --> 52:11.500
Go for it, Rex. We are there for you!

52:13.250 --> 52:14.833
Courage, Rex.

52:16.500 --> 52:18.250
Thank you, Boxer,

52:18.333 --> 52:19.958
but you don't fight tonight.

52:21.667 --> 52:23.000
My friends,

52:23.083 --> 52:26.750
What would you say if we change the chance

52:26.833 --> 52:28.833
in 60 against one?

52:28.917 --> 52:31.208
For your pleasure

52:31.292 --> 52:32.667
and mine.

52:32.750 --> 52:36.792
I will destroy this pathetic dog myself.

52:36.875 --> 52:38.083
That was not the deal.

52:38.167 --> 52:40.958
Can we not solve this in a more civilized way?

52:41.042 --> 52:42.875
You are dead.

52:45.333 --> 52:47.750
Apparently we are going to lose another cellmate.

52:47.833 --> 52:50.292
In the red corner, me!

52:52.333 --> 52:55.375
In the blue corner, my dinner.

52:56.250 --> 52:58.292
I'm too cute to die.

52:58.375 --> 52:59.917
Remember the plan, Rex.

53:00.000 --> 53:04.083
Leave your action radius quickly, otherwise it will end very badly.

53:04.167 --> 53:05.292
Understood.

53:07.125 --> 53:08.917
Well well.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.667
It looks like your friend can walk faster than talk.

53:12.750 --> 53:14.833
Come on, Tyson. Leave him alone.

53:16.625 --> 53:19.292
And now let's have some fun.

53:19.375 --> 53:22.833
I will proceed slowly.

53:42.167 --> 53:43.250
Help!

54:05.667 --> 54:07.042
Boxer!

54:10.042 --> 54:11.792
Go ahead, pull, pull.

54:23.083 --> 54:25.917
Yes, no member of the royal family is going to hurt.

54:26.625 --> 54:29.708
Well, isn't it! - Tyson is furious.

54:29.792 --> 54:31.333
I can't watch.

54:38.167 --> 54:39.833
It is now or never!

54:40.292 --> 54:41.625
Yes Yes!

54:42.083 --> 54:44.708
No! - But what in ...

54:47.208 --> 54:50.167
You are going to pay for that, Wanda.

54:53.333 --> 54:54.750
What is happening here?

54:54.833 --> 54:56.875
Go back to your cages.

54:57.708 --> 54:58.833
Boxer!

55:01.625 --> 55:03.833
You are dead, Wanda!

55:08.458 --> 55:12.292
And stay in your cages. Now the competition will be over.

55:14.125 --> 55:15.958
Wanda, are you okay?

55:16.542 --> 55:18.250
For the time being.

55:18.333 --> 55:22.208
Thank you for saving my life. You were very brave.

55:22.292 --> 55:25.750
And very stupid. - You better get out of here.

55:25.833 --> 55:30.250
Your days are numbered, I tell you. - Easier said than done.

55:30.333 --> 55:34.708
According to me, either you are chosen by a visitor, which will be difficult,

55:34.792 --> 55:37.875
or you ask the chihuahua for help. - The chihuahua?

55:38.708 --> 55:40.250
Don't think about it!

55:40.608 --> 55:43.158
Are you listening again? - I heard it too.

55:43.458 --> 55:47.250
You said it yourself, Jack: Never kick Tyson on tiptoe.

55:47.542 --> 55:50.625
For you this is the rule five, for me it is number one.

55:51.042 --> 55:55.292
I worry. Hopefully there will be a visitor you choose tomorrow.

55:55.667 --> 55:57.458
I'm staying, Jack.

55:57.958 --> 56:00.333
You should not pretend to be a tough one.

56:00.417 --> 56:03.792
You just have to give up and run away from here as quickly as possible.

56:03.875 --> 56:05.417
No, I don't.

56:09.750 --> 56:12.875
You can't keep fleeing from bullies like Tyson.

56:12.958 --> 56:15.125
How should we deal with him?

56:15.708 --> 56:19.875
You have to face reality. Thanks to Wanda you are not a thing of the past.

56:19.958 --> 56:24.792
This is exactly the point. I could never have done it alone.

56:24.875 --> 56:27.292
United we are strong, divided we are weak.

56:27.708 --> 56:30.208
Our real fight is not against Tyson,

56:30.292 --> 56:31.500
but against fear.

56:31.583 --> 56:34.292
If we overcome them, we are free.

56:34.667 --> 56:37.875
Together we can overcome that tyrant.

56:38.708 --> 56:40.458
Bravo! - So you're participating?

56:40.542 --> 56:43.125
No, but it was a good speech.

56:43.208 --> 56:45.292
Perfect performance.

56:45.375 --> 56:49.542
I am emotional, I was moved. I have tears in my eyes.

56:49.625 --> 56:53.500
You already cry when they open a can of dog food!

56:53.583 --> 56:57.500
Anyway, that crazy dog will kill us all.

56:58.042 --> 57:01.667
I told you not to get involved with street dogs, Rex.

57:02.625 --> 57:04.375
What kind of friend are you?

57:18.042 --> 57:19.292
Yes!

57:20.208 --> 57:22.208
Here they come! It's visiting time!

57:25.958 --> 57:27.542
Along here, along here!

57:27.625 --> 57:29.583
Look, a corgi!

57:29.958 --> 57:32.083
<i> No ... Jack! </i>

57:32.167 --> 57:34.542
Don't say anything. That's what Friends Are For.

57:34.625 --> 57:35.917
I want this one, mom.

57:36.000 --> 57:39.542
Are you sure, honey? Don't you want to look around first?

57:39.625 --> 57:41.333
No, mother. Please!

57:42.125 --> 57:44.333
You have chosen a good puppy.

57:44.417 --> 57:46.708
No, wait. I don't want to leave.

57:46.792 --> 57:49.667
Some dogs are lucky!

57:50.000 --> 57:52.417
Rex? - Don't worry, Wanda.

57:52.500 --> 57:54.958
I'm coming back to save you. I promise.

57:55.208 --> 57:56.542
Rex!

57:58.500 --> 58:01.125
Shall I help you, honey? - No mom.

58:01.208 --> 58:03.208
He's mine, I want to wear it.

58:07.917 --> 58:09.583
Hey, no, no! Back here!

58:18.500 --> 58:20.583
I want another one.

58:20.667 --> 58:22.083
OK, guys.

58:22.167 --> 58:25.000
On the terrace! You need some fresh air.

58:31.625 --> 58:34.500
Wanda, come here and now!

58:35.000 --> 58:37.333
We still have a bill to settle.

58:38.375 --> 58:40.292
He is going to destroy her.

58:40.375 --> 58:42.208
We have to do something.

58:42.292 --> 58:44.833
Forget it. We can't handle this.

58:44.917 --> 58:48.167
Jack is right, we'd better stay out of it.

58:48.250 --> 58:50.917
You can't stop Tyson if he's angry.

58:56.375 --> 58:59.708
Why did you betray me for that pathetic corgi?

58:59.792 --> 59:02.250
I have a weakness for dogs with a high bloodline.

59:02.333 --> 59:06.333
You will regret your expensive taste.

59:23.917 --> 59:25.125
Rex!

59:25.417 --> 59:28.625
What are you doing here? Are you crazy?

59:29.792 --> 59:33.625
He came back for his girlfriend. That's so cute!

59:33.708 --> 59:35.583
No, I came back for you, Tyson.

59:35.667 --> 59:37.708
You are not a leader, you are a bully.

59:37.792 --> 59:40.375
You don't deserve respect, you just sow fear.

59:40.458 --> 59:44.000
And you deserve the right to a good beating.

59:46.500 --> 59:47.500
Rex!

59:49.708 --> 59:52.542
Yes Yes! - Is that all you have?

59:52.625 --> 59:55.000
We are not in a hurry, are we?

59:55.083 --> 59:59.042
I'll show you who's in charge here, you.

59:59.292 --> 01:00:03.125
Do you really think someone would follow a loser like you?

01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:06.625
Who can be so crazy? - Me for example.

01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:11.292
I'll deal with you later. Anyone else?

01:00:12.417 --> 01:00:14.333
I? Serious?

01:00:14.417 --> 01:00:16.792
What do I have to do with this?

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:19.875
Damn, it's good!

01:00:19.958 --> 01:00:24.667
The saying goes, united we are strong! - I support it and ...

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:27.417
He is right in theater jargon.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:30.083
But take it easy, please.

01:00:30.167 --> 01:00:33.000
You have problems with anger management.

01:00:33.083 --> 01:00:36.958
Does anyone have anything else to say? I am ready to tackle you all.

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:41.250
It really is a great time.

01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:45.042
The biggest thing we have! Take him out, Boxer.

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:47.708
You are on your own, Tyson.

01:00:47.792 --> 01:00:51.375
Okay, I'll do it myself.

01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:54.292
I'm going to enjoy this.

01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:56.333
Whenever you want, Tyson.

01:00:57.417 --> 01:01:00.833
Can he talk? Go ahead, big man, let's see what you can do.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:12.417
Yes! - Bravo!

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.875
Yes!

01:01:18.792 --> 01:01:21.750
What is happening here? - We can go better.

01:01:22.583 --> 01:01:24.792
Do you remember my speech about freedom?

01:01:24.875 --> 01:01:26.208
Here we go again.

01:01:26.292 --> 01:01:29.667
No, no speeches. I really found a way out.

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:31.083
Come on, guys!

01:01:31.625 --> 01:01:35.375
You know, Rex, I don't want to be on the street again.

01:01:35.708 --> 01:01:38.583
Boss? - It's not that bad here.

01:01:38.667 --> 01:01:41.875
With Tyson out of the way it will be great here.

01:01:41.958 --> 01:01:46.583
It is very cold outside. Believe it or not, I hate winter.

01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:50.333
Wanda - I thought you'd never ask.

01:01:50.583 --> 01:01:51.583
Thanks everyone.

01:01:59.667 --> 01:02:01.167
Can you believe it, Charlie?

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:02.792
Rex has only just died

01:02:02.875 --> 01:02:07.125
and they erase all traces of him, as if he were never here.

01:02:07.208 --> 01:02:10.875
You better keep quiet, Nelson, or they'll put you away too.

01:02:10.958 --> 01:02:13.333
You have now become an old relic, you know.

01:02:13.667 --> 01:02:15.375
How dare you?

01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:30.708
Here we are! East West home is best.

01:02:31.083 --> 01:02:33.208
After you, my lady.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.625
And these two, who are they? - Half-breed and a street dog.

01:02:37.708 --> 01:02:40.042
Do they think they live here?

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:45.125
Sorry you two, you are not welcome here. Get out.

01:02:45.208 --> 01:02:47.625
Hold on, good man, I'll explain everything.

01:02:47.708 --> 01:02:50.083
I'm the queen's corgi and your ...

01:02:50.458 --> 01:02:51.625
Away!

01:02:54.458 --> 01:02:57.042
They didn't recognize you. What now?

01:02:57.125 --> 01:02:59.792
We sneak back inside. I know a way.

01:03:01.458 --> 01:03:04.333
There was a hole in the wall right here.

01:03:04.417 --> 01:03:06.542
This is how we escaped.

01:03:06.625 --> 01:03:09.083
But it's gone. What are we doing?

01:03:09.167 --> 01:03:12.542
I know of no other way to get in. - I have an idea.

01:03:27.917 --> 01:03:29.250
Wanda!

01:03:29.333 --> 01:03:32.917
I can not follow. You run too fast for me.

01:03:33.333 --> 01:03:36.500
All right, wait here for me. I'll be back.

01:03:36.583 --> 01:03:37.667
But where do you go ...

01:03:44.667 --> 01:03:47.708
# The funeral of Rex # - What? I kill?

01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:55.417
Come on, Charlie, the queen is waiting for us.

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:58.125
It's your coronation, for God's sake!

01:03:58.208 --> 01:03:59.833
You can't be late.

01:03:59.917 --> 01:04:01.417
Shut up, old fool.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.208
I am now the new top dog,

01:04:04.292 --> 01:04:06.958
so I decided to change a few things here.

01:04:07.042 --> 01:04:11.292
First, I charge a 50% tax on dinner.

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:16.875
Tell me, don't you think you're a bit strict?

01:04:19.542 --> 01:04:25.625
Secondly, I want to be addressed at all times with "excellence",

01:04:25.708 --> 01:04:31.125
except for informal occasions, where you can call me "sire".

01:04:31.958 --> 01:04:34.208
Yes, Excellency, sire.

01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:39.375
Third, when I step past, I want you to look down.

01:04:39.458 --> 01:04:43.167
Not too much, more or less ... something like that.

01:04:46.167 --> 01:04:48.417
Have I been clear enough?

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:49.542
Yes, Excellency.

01:04:49.625 --> 01:04:52.333
I didn't hear that well. Repeat!

01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:56.542
Yes, Excellency, sire. - Yes, sir, excellence.

01:04:56.625 --> 01:04:57.833
Perfect.

01:04:57.917 --> 01:05:03.750
Now, you can dispose of while I prepare for my coronation.

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:06.125
Charlie is completely crazy.

01:05:06.208 --> 01:05:08.750
He makes me miss the good old Rex.

01:05:10.042 --> 01:05:12.333
Rex! - Wanda.

01:05:12.417 --> 01:05:14.333
I have a surprise for you.

01:05:14.417 --> 01:05:17.667
Wait, I have good news for you. Apparently ...

01:05:18.833 --> 01:05:20.250
... I'm dead.

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:24.542
But what are you saying? - Watch? My own funeral.

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:29.458
Is that the queen? "Yes, and on the cross below, I am.

01:05:29.542 --> 01:05:32.125
That's why nobody came looking for you.

01:05:32.208 --> 01:05:37.000
Exactly. Charlie had it all planned and now he is top dog.

01:05:37.083 --> 01:05:39.125
No, not. - No?

01:05:39.132 --> 01:05:40.632
No, not if it's up to us.

01:05:40.642 --> 01:05:42.250
U.S? - Hello, kid!

01:05:42.333 --> 01:05:44.042
Surprise! - Jack!

01:05:44.125 --> 01:05:47.000
Rule seven: Wanda does not accept refusal.

01:05:47.292 --> 01:05:49.000
United ... - ... are we ...

01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:50.708
... strong!

01:05:50.792 --> 01:05:53.250
It's great to see you.

01:05:53.333 --> 01:05:56.375
Tell me how you got out of the kennel?

01:05:56.458 --> 01:06:00.417
It's much better if you don't know. - Maybe. I love how you think.

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:04.625
Let's hurry up. Bernard has a good idea to get into the palace.

01:06:09.875 --> 01:06:12.583
Where's that damn dog?

01:06:12.667 --> 01:06:15.417
Let him get along, okay?

01:06:26.792 --> 01:06:27.792
Hey!

01:06:27.875 --> 01:06:29.125
Come on!

01:06:31.792 --> 01:06:33.292
What is happening? - Stop them!

01:06:36.875 --> 01:06:38.250
Hey! - We get them!

01:06:38.958 --> 01:06:41.000
Come, don't let them escape!

01:06:41.083 --> 01:06:43.250
Stop them! - Let's split up!

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:55.125
So who is the queen's top dog?

01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:57.208
I will actually be, Charlie.

01:06:57.292 --> 01:06:59.542
It looks like I'm back just in time

01:06:59.625 --> 01:07:01.917
to prevent the queen from making a mistake.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.125
You're still alive!

01:07:03.208 --> 01:07:06.417
How could you cheat on me? You were my best friend.

01:07:06.708 --> 01:07:09.292
But of course we are still friends, Rex.

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:11.875
We are not, you pushed me off the bridge.

01:07:11.958 --> 01:07:14.917
How absurd. You slipped and fell.

01:07:15.167 --> 01:07:16.500
Really?

01:07:16.917 --> 01:07:18.125
Charlie, this is Wanda.

01:07:18.625 --> 01:07:20.667
It is my pleasure to meet you.

01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:24.917
I will show you that it was not intentional.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
The proof is in the cupboard.

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:30.583
What proof? I know what happened, Charlie.

01:07:31.042 --> 01:07:32.917
I was there too, remember?

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.875
Open the door and you'll see. - I will do it.

01:07:37.625 --> 01:07:39.375
No, Wanda, it can be a trap!

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:47.417
End of game, Rex!

01:07:51.292 --> 01:07:56.708
You survived the ice, show me how to handle fire.

01:07:57.375 --> 01:08:01.875
I'm sorry, but I'm waiting for a gold necklace. Bye.

01:08:14.167 --> 01:08:15.708
There you are.

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:19.207
Please, come over here. They are waiting for you.

01:08:32.125 --> 01:08:34.292
Wanda, come, I need help.

01:08:35.582 --> 01:08:36.875
Wanda!

01:08:39.207 --> 01:08:40.750
Wanda, where are you?

01:08:43.125 --> 01:08:44.250
Wanda!

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.500
Wanda.

01:09:35.332 --> 01:09:36.582
What is happening?

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.207
Rex! - Do not move. I'm taking you out of here.

01:09:40.957 --> 01:09:44.082
And you? - It's too heavy for two.

01:09:44.167 --> 01:09:46.082
I don't want to leave!

01:09:46.832 --> 01:09:48.207
See you soon, Wanda!

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:41.542
After the death of my dearest, dearest Rexy ...

01:10:52.333 --> 01:10:55.250
Maybe I should first take a nap.

01:11:06.833 --> 01:11:10.458
The honor is entirely up to me to give you the golden collar

01:11:10.542 --> 01:11:12.542
for the queen's best friend.

01:11:14.833 --> 01:11:16.792
Where is the golden collar?

01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:28.625
What a circus.

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:37.458
Boys!

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.500
Wanda - I'm above!

01:11:40.875 --> 01:11:43.750
Wow! I didn't know she could fly.

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:46.833
What are you doing up there? - I'm trying to save Rex.

01:11:46.917 --> 01:11:48.208
What did she say?

01:11:50.583 --> 01:11:51.958
We will catch you!

01:11:56.208 --> 01:11:57.792
I got her.

01:11:58.292 --> 01:12:01.292
Where is she n? - Hey!

01:12:01.375 --> 01:12:03.250
She disappeared like snow in the sun.

01:12:03.333 --> 01:12:07.542
That was good. - Enough time wasted.

01:12:07.625 --> 01:12:10.333
If we don't go in immediately, Rex will be roasted.

01:12:11.083 --> 01:12:13.583
Guys, we have to save Rex.

01:12:13.667 --> 01:12:17.792
I once shot a scene in which I ran into a burning building.

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:18.958
Run!

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:28.125
Help me!

01:12:29.208 --> 01:12:31.292
I'm doing this. Get out of the way.

01:12:33.792 --> 01:12:35.375
I can not see anything.

01:12:35.458 --> 01:12:37.333
Me neither. - Rex!

01:12:37.417 --> 01:12:40.208
Wow! - Rex! Wanda!

01:12:46.042 --> 01:12:49.042
Guys, we have to put out the fire immediately.

01:12:49.125 --> 01:12:51.375
Jack and the boss, get the hose.

01:12:51.458 --> 01:12:54.708
Okay, understood. - Al, Bernard, come with me.

01:12:55.917 --> 01:12:57.208
Dear God.

01:12:58.458 --> 01:13:01.208
How do we get the hose out? - I will do it.

01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:09.750
Good job, boss.

01:13:17.083 --> 01:13:18.917
Yes, as I thought. Perfect.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.208
Hold on tight.

01:13:21.792 --> 01:13:23.833
I'm above!

01:13:25.292 --> 01:13:27.208
I'll get them!

01:13:37.917 --> 01:13:38.958
Watch out!

01:13:46.708 --> 01:13:48.417
I think I have mastered it.

01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:51.917
Now let a woman show you how to do it.

01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:59.675
What are you waiting for?

01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:00.958
I am coming!

01:14:41.792 --> 01:14:43.417
Has anyone seen Rex?

01:14:44.083 --> 01:14:46.208
Take a look at that room.

01:14:46.292 --> 01:14:48.792
It is not possible that he made it.

01:14:50.792 --> 01:14:51.792
Rex!

01:14:59.792 --> 01:15:02.458
There is no trace of Rex. - Rex!

01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:05.500
Rex!

01:15:09.583 --> 01:15:10.958
I heard something.

01:15:11.583 --> 01:15:14.250
And what was it? - Up here.

01:15:15.708 --> 01:15:17.208
It's Rex! Rex!

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:19.167
Wanda!

01:15:19.542 --> 01:15:21.000
He's in the chimney.

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:25.458
Come down. What are you waiting for? - I'm stuck.

01:15:26.833 --> 01:15:28.292
What are you doing?

01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:32.750
That's sweet!

01:15:33.458 --> 01:15:34.458
Wait.

01:15:34.833 --> 01:15:37.458
You have to solve this situation, I'll be right back.

01:15:38.125 --> 01:15:39.750
I have to get something right.

01:15:41.167 --> 01:15:45.583
And so, on this extraordinary day of coronation,

01:15:45.667 --> 01:15:49.417
we open a new chapter, a new beginning.

01:15:50.167 --> 01:15:52.167
Hey! - Goodness!

01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:54.417
What is happening here?

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:56.500
Give me my golden necklace!

01:15:56.583 --> 01:15:58.208
Come here! Stand still!

01:16:06.875 --> 01:16:09.667
Come on, Bernard. Push, higher.

01:16:14.583 --> 01:16:16.792
Oh, oh, that hurt!

01:16:17.125 --> 01:16:20.042
But you are with us again. - I have your collar.

01:16:20.125 --> 01:16:21.417
Wanda!

01:16:24.458 --> 01:16:25.875
Well well.

01:16:25.958 --> 01:16:28.667
Look what a mess.

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:32.167
I see that you have quite destroyed this room.

01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:35.417
We? - Rex, you're back!

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:38.025
Guys, it's so great to see you again.

01:16:38.075 --> 01:16:40.185
What exactly is going on here, Charlie?

01:16:40.208 --> 01:16:46.083
He wanted so badly to be the top dog that he threatened to burn the whole palace flat.

01:16:46.167 --> 01:16:48.875
Did you really do this, Charlie? - It's our house.

01:16:48.958 --> 01:16:51.250
Keep you out of it, Nelson.

01:16:51.333 --> 01:16:55.292
Now I am going to end this once and for all.

01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:58.417
You are more stupid than you look, mate.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:01.583
You hoped I drowned when you pushed that bridge over me.

01:17:01.667 --> 01:17:05.208
That's true. - Or you hoped I ended up in the gutter.

01:17:05.292 --> 01:17:07.333
Without home and without love.

01:17:07.583 --> 01:17:10.125
No, I thought you drowned.

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:13.208
We can arrange that for you, you know?

01:17:13.292 --> 01:17:15.000
Yes, I agree, boss.

01:17:15.083 --> 01:17:18.458
In any case, I am about to become the new top dog,

01:17:18.542 --> 01:17:21.917
and my word is like gold. To say so.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.125
You won't be, Charlie.

01:17:24.417 --> 01:17:29.542
I say, once top dog, always top dog.

01:17:29.625 --> 01:17:32.500
Why does he have to be the Queen's top corgi?

01:17:32.583 --> 01:17:36.958
I have served Her Majesty very well and I have seniority!

01:17:37.042 --> 01:17:38.375
I have every right.

01:17:38.458 --> 01:17:40.542
Stop crackling.

01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:42.667
You tried and failed.

01:17:45.542 --> 01:17:46.875
No, Wanda.

01:17:46.958 --> 01:17:49.625
I thought this was what you wanted.

01:17:50.208 --> 01:17:54.500
I do not get it. All you talked about was being a top dog.

01:17:54.833 --> 01:17:56.458
Not anymore.

01:17:56.542 --> 01:17:59.458
If Charlie wants it so badly, he can have it.

01:18:00.125 --> 01:18:03.333
I just want to be your top dog.

01:18:03.625 --> 01:18:05.917
You are at the top of my list.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.208
I love the love scenes.

01:18:08.292 --> 01:18:10.625
This is what I call a class display.

01:18:11.292 --> 01:18:14.083
You don't mean it, do you?

01:18:14.167 --> 01:18:15.208
Of course it is.

01:18:20.042 --> 01:18:22.333
Dear God!

01:18:22.417 --> 01:18:24.458
What the hell happened here?

01:18:30.333 --> 01:18:31.625
Rex!

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:33.167
So you are still alive.

01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:35.875
It was just a terrible mistake.

01:18:36.167 --> 01:18:38.750
We thought a fox ...

01:18:39.208 --> 01:18:42.125
I've missed you so much.

01:18:42.708 --> 01:18:47.667
Oh, dear! This room needs to be updated.

01:18:53.458 --> 01:18:55.125
Rex.

01:18:55.208 --> 01:18:59.208
Now I know where you were looking for love.

01:18:59.708 --> 01:19:02.042
You have a good taste, Rexy.

01:19:02.125 --> 01:19:04.958
Love lets everyone act in mysterious ways.

01:19:05.042 --> 01:19:06.917
Isn't that right, Philip?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.583
What? Oh yeah!

01:19:09.917 --> 01:19:12.417
Very mysterious, I would say.

01:19:13.875 --> 01:19:16.750
Am I calling the guards to take all those dogs away?

01:19:16.833 --> 01:19:18.667
No, it won't be necessary.

01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:21.583
It's time to have some new blood in the palace.

01:19:21.667 --> 01:19:22.958
Really?

01:19:23.042 --> 01:19:24.583
You mean the whole gang?

01:19:24.667 --> 01:19:27.125
Why not? This house is big.

01:19:27.208 --> 01:19:29.625
I thought you only had eyes for the corgi.

01:19:29.708 --> 01:19:32.417
You are never too old to change your mind.

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:36.208
If you say so ... But who will be the top dog?

01:19:36.292 --> 01:19:40.667
It is clear that Rexy already made that decision.

01:19:40.958 --> 01:19:42.208
And last but not least,

01:19:42.292 --> 01:19:46.875
true love and royal obligations can make life difficult for loved ones.

01:19:46.958 --> 01:19:49.958
We did very well, didn't we, honey?

01:19:50.042 --> 01:19:53.500
Yes darling. We're from the old school.

01:19:53.958 --> 01:19:55.458
Well, come with me.

01:19:55.542 --> 01:19:59.125
Many of you need a freshening up.

01:19:59.208 --> 01:20:02.417
Then we will enjoy a wonderful dinner.

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.208
Guys!

01:20:04.875 --> 01:20:07.167
Now, and then we will live in the palace.

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:09.042
What a sensation!

01:20:09.125 --> 01:20:12.167
Well, a good ending, you like that, right, Bernard?

01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:15.833
Do you want to leave Charlie unpunished?

01:20:15.917 --> 01:20:18.208
He will not go unpunished.

01:20:18.292 --> 01:20:20.875
He has no idea what to expect.

01:20:21.708 --> 01:20:23.042
Believe me.

01:20:36.250 --> 01:20:39.375
After you, my lady. - Rex.

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:45.100
# JUST MARRIED #

01:20:54.667 --> 01:20:56.792
Charlie, always keep in mind

01:20:56.875 --> 01:21:00.875
that as a top dog you have a multitude of responsibilities.

01:21:04.917 --> 01:21:07.042
No, it's a nightmare!

01:21:07.125 --> 01:21:08.875
I want to resign. Yes, I give up.

01:21:08.958 --> 01:21:12.792
I am not suitable to be a top dog. Please.

01:21:12.875 --> 01:21:15.167
That is what happens if you are the top dog.
