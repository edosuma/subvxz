01:05.441 --> 01:07.902
No... Please...

01:09.982 --> 01:11.962
HE SCREAMS

01:22.086 --> 01:24.386
Challenging and witty. 
Indeed.

01:24.386 --> 01:26.946
And, of course, the play on
the name, Ernest. Very clever.

01:26.946 --> 01:29.086
Clever.

01:29.086 --> 01:31.226
The problems with not being earnest.

01:31.226 --> 01:33.546
Leading to shenanigans, yes.
William...

01:33.546 --> 01:38.626
There's something I need to tell you
that I should have told you before.
It was remiss of me.

01:38.626 --> 01:40.666
Julia, what is it?

01:41.846 --> 01:43.386
I've been offered...

01:43.386 --> 01:49.586
Well, actually, it's more than that.
I'm seriously considering a new job.

01:49.586 --> 01:55.706
A new job? As head of paediatric
surgery at a new children's hospital.

01:57.446 --> 01:59.946
Oh...

01:59.946 --> 02:02.186
Well, that's wonderful.

02:02.186 --> 02:05.726
I hadn't heard of a new children's
hospital being built in Toronto.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.705
Yes...

02:08.705 --> 02:10.346
It's in Buffalo.

02:10.346 --> 02:13.286
Buffalo?

02:13.286 --> 02:16.546
I... Excuse me. Sir, ma'am.

02:16.546 --> 02:20.126
I've looking for a detective
and a female doctor couple.
Would you be that?

02:21.766 --> 02:27.166
Yes, we would be that...couple.
There's a telephone call
inside for you. Please.

02:27.166 --> 02:30.186
The other tenants called when
they heard the victim screaming.

02:30.186 --> 02:35.006
The lads responded, but when we
arrived all was quiet and the
door was secured from inside.

02:35.006 --> 02:37.206
Inside?
 Sir.

02:37.206 --> 02:40.826
The deceased, Mr Garbutt, had
barred the door with a chair.

02:40.826 --> 02:45.246
As if trying to keep someone out.
Indeed. Any signs of foul play?

02:45.246 --> 02:48.066
Well, that's just it, sir.
We're not sure.

02:48.066 --> 02:50.646
No obvious signs of trauma.

02:50.646 --> 02:54.226
Yet he was screaming.
Dementia perhaps? It's strange.

02:54.226 --> 02:58.566
His body is warm. Almost feverish.
How can that be? I've no idea.

02:59.606 --> 03:01.726
This is interesting.

03:01.726 --> 03:03.386
Blisters? Very recent.

03:03.386 --> 03:06.946
As one might see in
a serious burn or scalding.

03:06.946 --> 03:10.186
There's no sign of fire, Doctor.

03:11.806 --> 03:14.646
Something happened here.
And only to him.

03:14.646 --> 03:16.406
This plant hasn't fared
much better, sir.

03:16.406 --> 03:20.246
Probably just a case of
death by bachelor...

03:22.966 --> 03:26.826
It's very warm to the touch.
That's odd. Out of my way!

03:26.826 --> 03:29.566
I must get in. I am Nikolai Tesla.

03:29.566 --> 03:31.546
Mr Tesla?

03:31.546 --> 03:34.206
Ah, Detective Murdoch.

03:34.206 --> 03:37.886
I am here at the request of my
research associate, Mr Garbutt.

03:37.886 --> 03:39.666
He said it was a
matter of life and death.

03:41.246 --> 03:42.706
That it is, sir.

03:49.086 --> 03:52.186
When I examined the body further, I
found several more blistered areas

03:52.186 --> 03:55.606
like the one on Mr Garbutt's hand.
And the cause of death?

03:55.606 --> 04:01.066
Well, that's slightly more
straightforward in a way. In a way?

04:01.066 --> 04:07.466
When I opened him up I discovered
that the internal organs were, well,
for lack of a more accurate term,

04:07.466 --> 04:09.866
"cooked". Cooked?

04:09.866 --> 04:12.666
Even stranger,

04:12.666 --> 04:16.565
the damage to the internal organs
increased the deeper I went.

04:16.565 --> 04:18.426
As if he was "cooked"
from the inside.

04:18.426 --> 04:21.726
Perhaps Mr Tesla
can shed more light on this.

04:21.726 --> 04:23.446
I'd be delighted if he would.

04:25.066 --> 04:27.426
How long? Pardon?

04:28.986 --> 04:31.666
How long have you been considering
leaving your position here?

04:33.246 --> 04:35.326
That's hard to say.

04:35.326 --> 04:36.926
Some time, I suppose.

04:38.546 --> 04:42.146
Because if there is anything I have
said or done... No, William, no.

04:42.146 --> 04:44.286
It has nothing to do with you.

04:44.286 --> 04:46.806
How can you say that?
You're moving to another city.

04:46.806 --> 04:51.826
It's only Buffalo. We can still
visit with each other on weekends.

04:51.826 --> 04:58.706
Visit? If our work doesn't
intervene, if our schedules don't
clash. You should have consulted me.

04:58.706 --> 05:02.626
I regret not informing you earlier,
but...

05:03.686 --> 05:06.126
..this is my decision to make.

05:09.486 --> 05:11.226
What will happen to us?

05:13.106 --> 05:19.186
I'm not sure, William, but you
know how rarely opportunities come
along for a woman in my field.

05:19.186 --> 05:22.426
I can't ignore them on
the off-chance that...

05:22.426 --> 05:25.946
Julia, I thought
we had an understanding.

05:29.706 --> 05:30.846
We do.

05:30.846 --> 05:35.966
I'm just don't know
of what any more.

05:35.966 --> 05:38.266
Maybe we'll stay together.

05:38.266 --> 05:43.506
Or maybe you'll...find another
woman who will catch your eye and...

05:43.506 --> 05:45.586
I have no interest
in any other woman.

05:45.586 --> 05:50.026
William, I'm just saying,
yes, this will be different.

05:51.626 --> 05:53.706
Can't we live with that?

05:57.106 --> 06:00.446
Two days ago, I received
a telegram from Mr Garbutt.

06:00.446 --> 06:05.066
He said he needed to discuss an
urgent matter, but did not elaborate.

06:05.066 --> 06:07.046
Was he no longer employed by you?

06:07.046 --> 06:10.626
He and another protege,
Josef Karnaki, disappeared
about six months ago.

06:10.626 --> 06:12.346
Just up and left?

06:12.346 --> 06:15.766
It is their prerogative, but on
this occasion I was disappointed.

06:15.766 --> 06:18.046
Mr Karnaki, in particular,
was quite brilliant.

06:18.046 --> 06:21.026
And could Mr Karnaki be
involved in Mr Garbutt's death?

06:21.026 --> 06:22.786
I have no idea.

06:22.786 --> 06:28.006
Well, maybe you have an idea how
this research assistant ended up
well-done from the inside out?

06:28.006 --> 06:32.766
Mr Tesla, I must return to the
crime scene to see if there's
anything I've overlooked.

06:32.766 --> 06:35.946
Would you care to join me?
I would, indeed, Detective Murdoch.

06:35.946 --> 06:39.146
I find this all very disturbing...

06:39.146 --> 06:44.726
How so? I've been experimenting
with ways to transmit
electromagnetic energy

06:44.726 --> 06:48.926
through the air using extremely
high-frequency radio waves.

06:48.926 --> 06:51.006
Mini waves?

06:51.006 --> 06:55.026
I prefer the Greek prefix,
microwaves.

06:55.026 --> 06:59.026
And while these microwaves
may distort the surrounding
magnetic field,

06:59.026 --> 07:04.706
the waves are able to pass through
most mediums unimpeded. I see.

07:04.706 --> 07:12.266
The thing is, Detective, when these
waves pass through water, they excite
the molecules to a boiling point.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.466
Human cells are mostly water.

07:14.466 --> 07:20.666
Yes. If you were to aim these waves
at a human, you would,
in essence, cook.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.966
My God.
That's what killed Mr Garbutt.

07:22.966 --> 07:27.266
But the implications go far beyond
one death, Detective Murdoch.

07:28.806 --> 07:30.046
Terrifying, yes.

07:38.362 --> 07:44.262
Mr Karnaki must have found
a way to make a weapon out
of these microwaves.

07:44.262 --> 07:48.102
He spoke of such when he worked
for me. I rebuked him of course.

07:48.102 --> 07:50.422
I fear I may have wounded his pride.

07:50.422 --> 07:53.162
There was a desiccated plant
in Garbutt's apartment.

07:53.162 --> 07:55.242
It was still warm to the touch.

07:55.242 --> 07:58.202
The microwave will excite
any water molecule in its path.

07:58.202 --> 08:01.182
Leaving a trail of dead,
wilted vegetation?

08:01.182 --> 08:04.042
Leading back
to the wave's point of origin.

08:04.042 --> 08:05.882
Somewhere in this direction.

08:08.982 --> 08:10.962
There's another desiccated plant.

08:10.962 --> 08:13.202
Yes, and more that way.

08:13.202 --> 08:17.242
Was there any bad blood
between Mr Karnaki and the deceased?

08:17.242 --> 08:20.262
Only healthy scientific rivalry.

08:20.262 --> 08:26.282
It seemed to me, though, that of
the pair, Mr Garbutt was hampered
somewhat by his conscience.

08:26.282 --> 08:29.562
An interesting observation.
Perhaps Mr Garbutt didn't like

08:29.562 --> 08:35.702
what Mr Karnaki was doing
and Mr Karnaki decided to take care
of the problem. Perhaps.

08:35.702 --> 08:40.282
At any rate, it's clear we
have to find the weapon, Mr Tesla,

08:40.282 --> 08:42.782
before it's fired again.

08:42.782 --> 08:46.202
This should be the
weapon's point of origin.

08:46.202 --> 08:47.942
Remain behind me, sir.

08:53.822 --> 08:57.142
They must have taken the
weapon with them. But how?

08:57.142 --> 09:01.682
To generate the energy
required to kill a man,
the device would have to be massive.

09:01.682 --> 09:03.422
And yet it's not here.

09:03.422 --> 09:06.902
A weapon that can kill
a man through a wall?

09:06.902 --> 09:09.082
Diabolical is what it is.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.802
If it exists. Sir, it does exist.

09:11.802 --> 09:15.782
Mr Garbutt's wounds leave no doubt.
My immediate concern is where it is.

09:15.782 --> 09:21.922
For the weapon to be made portable,
it would require advancements
in miniaturisation and metallurgy,

09:21.922 --> 09:25.382
far outside Mr Karnaki's
areas of expertise.

09:25.382 --> 09:27.862
Not to mention the money
to finance the project.

09:27.862 --> 09:30.622
Miniaturisation,
metallurgy and money you say.

09:30.622 --> 09:33.682
We know a man who specialises
in those don't we, Murdoch?

09:33.682 --> 09:36.822
There's just one small problem.

09:36.822 --> 09:38.982
James Pendrick is in prison.

09:38.982 --> 09:42.762
Have you finally realised
my innocence, Murdoch?

09:42.762 --> 09:45.042
Am I to be released?

09:45.042 --> 09:47.102
Far from it, Mr Pendrick.

09:47.102 --> 09:51.262
You are here to answer questions
about yet another criminal affair.

09:51.262 --> 09:52.882
Why would I?

09:52.882 --> 09:57.082
I am to hang for murders
I did not commit. Everything
I treasure in life is gone.

09:57.082 --> 09:59.642
My work and my reputation
are in tatters.

09:59.642 --> 10:02.562
Even my wife will have no part of me.

10:02.562 --> 10:05.562
Perhaps it has something to do
with you attempting to kill her.

10:06.642 --> 10:08.702
I am an innocent man.

10:08.702 --> 10:12.402
Mr Pendrick, do you
know a Morris Garbutt?

10:14.802 --> 10:18.082
No. Do you know a Josef Karnaki? No.

10:18.082 --> 10:21.482
Do you know Nikolai Tesla?

10:21.482 --> 10:24.642
Tesla? Of course. We met on
several occasions in New York.

10:24.642 --> 10:28.362
Are you aware of his experiments
in wireless electrical transmission?

10:28.362 --> 10:32.622
He spoke of it
during our last meeting, six months
ago, seeking financial backing.

10:32.622 --> 10:36.882
It was an intriguing concept,
but the discussions went nowhere.

10:36.882 --> 10:39.482
What has this to do with anything?

10:39.482 --> 10:46.122
Mr Garbutt, an associate
of Mr Tesla's, was found dead
under mysterious circumstances.

10:46.122 --> 10:51.802
We believe a weapon using Mr Tesla's
technology was used to kill him.

10:51.802 --> 10:54.722
Fascinating.

10:54.722 --> 10:57.762
And you think I have
something to do with it?

10:57.762 --> 11:01.342
It would require someone
with your particular talents.

11:01.342 --> 11:04.022
Do you really think I care
about a weapon of the future?

11:10.682 --> 11:12.722
I'm going to hang in two weeks!

11:24.202 --> 11:26.722
Let's keep him here.
I may want to speak with him again.

11:26.722 --> 11:29.962
Good idea. He can't communicate
with his men if he's in our cells.

11:29.962 --> 11:32.682
His sincerity is alarming.

11:32.682 --> 11:36.402
Listen, a smiling killer,
don't be fooled by that.

11:36.402 --> 11:39.242
A man like that lives for
things like this death ray.

11:39.242 --> 11:41.942
Sir, there's a gentleman to see you.

11:41.942 --> 11:44.562
A rather demanding gentleman,
actually. Tell him to wait.

11:44.562 --> 11:47.802
That's just it. He's "waiting" in
your office. He barged right in.

11:47.802 --> 11:53.162
If you're not Queen bloody Victoria,
then you'll not be ordering Thomas
Charles Brackenreid around.

11:53.162 --> 11:56.162
Won't I? Terrence Meyers.

11:56.162 --> 11:59.622
Still in the employ of the
Canadian government, I take it?

11:59.622 --> 12:02.462
What are you doing here, Meyers? Oh,
and help yourself, why don't you?

12:05.422 --> 12:10.302
Gentlemen, there are mysterious
and disturbing events
transpiring hereabouts

12:10.302 --> 12:12.982
and I believe
you both know something about it.

12:14.482 --> 12:20.122
The world is changing in ways you
cannot imagine, so let's have
ourselves a little chat, shall we?

12:28.262 --> 12:30.282
Through clandestine operatives,

12:30.282 --> 12:33.042
we've learned a number of
international rogues
have gathered in Toronto.

12:33.042 --> 12:36.262
What exactly do you
mean by "rogues"? Smugglers...

12:36.262 --> 12:38.182
calling themselves businessmen,

12:38.182 --> 12:42.282
specialising in a growing field,
the sale of new and deadly weapons.

12:42.282 --> 12:44.422
Now if any of these
weapons should find...

12:44.422 --> 12:47.422
Should fall into the wrong hands.
Yes, yes, yes. We know all
of this already, Mr Meyers.

12:47.422 --> 12:50.442
My sources tell me that
these "arms dealers"

12:50.442 --> 12:55.222
are here because a weapon with
incredible destructive powers
is about to be sold.

12:55.222 --> 12:57.202
Sounds most dangerous.

12:57.202 --> 13:02.682
I've also heard this weapon has been
test-fired for potential buyers
with deadly results.

13:06.622 --> 13:10.742
Gentlemen, the winds of
war never truly die down.

13:10.742 --> 13:14.262
Can you imagine what would happen
if hundreds of these weapons

13:14.262 --> 13:17.162
were deployed against us
on the battlefield?

13:17.162 --> 13:18.842
Nothing we have could stop it.

13:18.842 --> 13:24.642
So instead of toying with me, I
suggest if you discover anything...
We'll notify you immediately.

13:26.962 --> 13:28.982
No need to see me out.

13:31.682 --> 13:34.762
Well, I've never seen him
like that before.

13:34.762 --> 13:36.642
Mmm.

13:36.642 --> 13:42.442
I have to admit, that bit about
the enemy using a weapon against us,
that got my attention.

13:42.442 --> 13:44.862
Genuine or not,
given Mr Meyers' dubious ethics,

13:44.862 --> 13:48.382
the thought of him possessing
that weapon is equally chilling.

13:48.382 --> 13:54.662
So, this Garbutt, he goes from
being Karnaki's associate to target
practise for his death ray. Why?

13:54.662 --> 13:58.662
Perhaps he had a change of heart
and was planning to betray the sale?

13:58.662 --> 14:02.242
Or, he simply became expendable.
So where do we start?

14:02.242 --> 14:05.182
Karnaki would have needed a place
to build and store the weapon.

14:05.182 --> 14:07.742
One of Pendrick's holdings.

14:07.742 --> 14:11.222
Sir, no luck finding Karnaki,
I'm afraid.

14:11.222 --> 14:13.182
I suspect somebody's harbouring him.

14:13.182 --> 14:15.902
George, let's try a
different line of investigation.

14:15.902 --> 14:19.222
Karnaki's work on the weapon
would have required a number
of specialised materials.

14:19.222 --> 14:23.562
Perhaps we can locate where
those materials were purchased.
Consult with Mr Tesla.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.782
And please tell him I'd like
to speak with him when I return.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.442
Sir, I'll bring him in. Thank you.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.802
Detective. Mrs Pendrick.

14:41.802 --> 14:43.642
What might I do for you?

14:43.642 --> 14:49.882
I'm afraid a man was killed last
night and we suspect a strange,
new kind of weapon was used.

14:49.882 --> 14:52.002
Your husband may have been involved.

14:52.002 --> 14:55.122
When it comes to James,
nothing surprises me any more.

14:55.122 --> 14:59.642
I was hoping you might be able
to provide me with a list of
buildings he owned in the city.

15:01.502 --> 15:04.682
I'll have the information
to you as soon as possible,

15:04.682 --> 15:07.482
but as you can see by the state of
my desk, I'm a bit out of sorts.

15:07.482 --> 15:12.782
Yes, I understand.
Since James's...situation

15:12.782 --> 15:15.442
I've been forced to deal
with business matters.

15:15.442 --> 15:21.342
I have a small army of lawyers
and accountants to assist me,
but I'm no businesswoman.

15:21.342 --> 15:29.022
I'm certain you will excel.
A number of his rivals
have offered to buy me out.

15:29.022 --> 15:32.802
It might be best to rid
myself of all of this.

15:32.802 --> 15:35.582
But you surely aren't here
to listen to my plight.

15:35.582 --> 15:39.482
It's quite all right, Mrs Pendrick.
Sally.

15:39.482 --> 15:42.122
Please call me Sally.

15:42.122 --> 15:45.802
Sally...
Might I call you William?

15:47.842 --> 15:52.282
Yes, I suppose that wouldn't be
too inappropriate.

15:52.282 --> 15:57.042
Soon I'll be divorced of more
than just James's holdings.

15:58.662 --> 16:00.362
I see.

16:00.362 --> 16:02.922
I know that must
sound terribly forward,

16:02.922 --> 16:06.802
but, after all, you could have sent
anyone here to get that list.

16:10.642 --> 16:12.662
I'd best be going.

16:20.642 --> 16:24.042
You mentioned earlier that the
generation of these microwaves

16:24.042 --> 16:26.822
would severely distort the
surrounding magnetic field?

16:26.822 --> 16:30.282
That's right, but it is my
hope we can solve this problem.

16:30.282 --> 16:35.742
Let's say the weapon
is at some central location.

16:35.742 --> 16:41.562
What if we were to deploy compasses
around the city.

16:41.562 --> 16:43.582
Then, as the charge builds...

16:43.582 --> 16:48.642
The compasses would be drawn off
magnetic north in the direction
of the weapon.

16:48.642 --> 16:53.162
We could then map the direction all
of the compasses are pointing to.

16:55.082 --> 16:58.002
All intersecting
at the location of the weapon.

16:58.002 --> 16:59.582
Very good, Detective Murdoch.

16:59.582 --> 17:05.402
But, for this to work, the
compasses must be deployed and
monitored while the charge builds.

17:05.402 --> 17:07.262
I have an idea about that as well.

17:07.262 --> 17:09.362
The good news is the
weapon will be fired.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.002
The bad news is...

17:11.002 --> 17:13.942
the weapon will be fired. Indeed.

17:13.942 --> 17:15.561
Mr Meyers.

17:17.462 --> 17:19.902
I take it you found the weapon.

17:19.902 --> 17:22.602
Not yet, but I believe I have
found a way to locate it.

17:22.602 --> 17:26.622
All I need is for the weapon
to be fired and I am counting
on you to arrange that.

17:26.622 --> 17:30.602
Me?
What makes you think I could do that?

17:30.602 --> 17:35.542
Because, Mr Meyers, I believe the
reason you know so much about
this affair is because you,

17:35.542 --> 17:39.882
acting on behalf of the Canadian
government, are attempting
to purchase the weapon.

17:41.522 --> 17:43.622
Preposterous.

17:43.622 --> 17:48.402
Further, I believe one of these arms
dealers is an operative of yours.

17:50.122 --> 17:54.122
You know I can't divulge anything,
Murdoch, even if I wanted to.

17:54.122 --> 17:55.842
Of course not.

17:55.842 --> 17:59.902
At any rate, if you want to locate
the weapon, and I believe you do,

17:59.902 --> 18:03.542
you'll be sure that it gets fired
tonight at precisely six o'clock.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.922
And no-one is to be harmed.

18:05.922 --> 18:08.802
Six o'clock precisely.

18:08.802 --> 18:12.602
Nothing. It seems Mr Meyers
word is as good as always.

18:14.522 --> 18:18.122
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure of that.
It's worked, Detective!

18:18.122 --> 18:21.062
Mr Tesla, the direction.

18:21.062 --> 18:23.242
Due east.

18:23.242 --> 18:27.162
Call box six, south by south-west.

18:27.162 --> 18:32.882
Sir call box three is reporting west
by north-west and call box seven
is reporting north by north-west.

18:32.882 --> 18:34.742
North west...

18:34.742 --> 18:40.042
George is there a Pendrick
building at this location?

18:40.042 --> 18:41.722
There is, sir.

18:41.722 --> 18:43.242
It's a livery.

18:48.802 --> 18:52.282
Once inside we take no chances,
understood?

18:52.282 --> 18:54.602
Meyers... Thank you
for leading me here, Detective.

18:54.602 --> 18:57.002
Once again, you did not disappoint.

18:57.002 --> 19:00.042
I'll be taking it from here,
Inspector. Not bloody likely, Meyers.

19:02.302 --> 19:04.262
This is a matter of
national security.

19:04.262 --> 19:06.962
Surely your fealty to your adopted
dominion is not at issue here.

19:06.962 --> 19:11.402
Fealty... Devotion. That's
codswallop and you know it.

19:11.402 --> 19:14.822
That weapon is far too dangerous
for any nation to possess.

19:14.822 --> 19:17.062
Better us than them, Murdoch.

19:17.062 --> 19:20.022
And don't be so naive to think the
Canadian Government would destroy

19:20.022 --> 19:23.382
such an advanced piece of technology
and burn all the blueprints.

19:31.802 --> 19:35.462
Well, gentlemen,
I don't think any of you will be
laying claim to the contraption.

19:35.462 --> 19:39.422
The bloody thing's not here.
Impossible, even miniaturised
it would be sizable.

19:39.422 --> 19:43.382
There is no way they could
have moved it that quickly.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.842
Actually, sirs, I think
we have a bigger problem.

19:45.842 --> 19:48.022
I believe the death ray
is about to fire again.

19:56.582 --> 20:00.402
My apologies, gentlemen,
I fear I have led you into a trap.

20:08.362 --> 20:10.742
SPLUTTERING

20:11.782 --> 20:15.902
The bloody water nearly scalded me.
The "bloody" water saved our lives.

20:15.902 --> 20:18.602
Clever deduction, Detective Murdoch.

20:18.602 --> 20:21.662
An educated guess.
But where is the weapon?

20:21.662 --> 20:24.282
Gentlemen, I've come
to the conclusion that the weapon

20:24.282 --> 20:30.202
must be mobile,
mounted to a vehicle of some sort.
A very large vehicle, I expect.

20:30.202 --> 20:33.922
And aside from water tanks, how
do we defend ourselves against it?

20:33.922 --> 20:36.762
I would be happy to turn my
attention to developing a defence.

20:36.762 --> 20:38.802
That would be appreciated, Mr Tesla.

20:38.802 --> 20:44.662
In the meantime, I believe another
conversation with Mr Pendrick
is in order. Where's my hat?

20:45.117 --> 20:47.997
The device was fired again,
wasn't it?

20:47.997 --> 20:53.137
How would you know that,
Mr Pendrick, unless you were
directly involved?

20:53.137 --> 20:55.997
I've been monitoring events
since our last discussion.

20:55.997 --> 20:57.497
A compass?

20:57.497 --> 20:59.917
A crude one.

20:59.917 --> 21:02.377
I didn't realise it was so
difficult to scavenge a straight pin.

21:02.377 --> 21:06.037
Clearly you know more than
you're saying, Mr Pendrick.

21:06.037 --> 21:08.377
I watch and I listen, Detective.

21:08.377 --> 21:12.637
That, and a basic knowledge
of electrodynamics led me to
realise what you were doing.

21:12.637 --> 21:18.817
Perhaps you've also deduced
that I know the weapon was fired
from one of your buildings.

21:18.817 --> 21:23.957
That's impossible. It's a fact.
Let me out, Murdoch. I can help you.

21:23.957 --> 21:26.557
You want to help me?

21:26.557 --> 21:29.197
Then tell me where the weapon is.

21:29.197 --> 21:31.557
We know it's been mounted to
one of your heavy duty vehicles.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.757
I keep telling you, Murdoch,
you've got the wrong man.

21:38.157 --> 21:41.977
You've got the wrong man, Murdoch.
Murdoch! Murdoch!

21:44.817 --> 21:47.737
I doubt think Mr Pendrick
will be of any further use to us.

21:47.737 --> 21:53.417
You're saying he's not a party to
this? No, he's unlikely to confess
no matter how I approach him.

21:53.417 --> 21:57.297
We'll send him back to Don Jail
and good riddance. Yes, sir.

21:57.297 --> 21:59.177
How goes it, Mr Tesla?

21:59.177 --> 22:02.537
Quite well, I think. I have
been musing over the death ray.

22:02.537 --> 22:05.317
Since Karnaki seems to
have devised a technique

22:05.317 --> 22:11.177
to calibrate the ray's focal point,
I believe the best defence mechanism
may be some sort of shield.

22:11.177 --> 22:14.857
Sounds intriguing. Ingenious,
actually, but I am only one man.

22:14.857 --> 22:19.537
I will need a constable to assist me.
Scientifically minded, of course.

22:19.537 --> 22:24.057
Would youthful enthusiasm suffice?
I suppose it will have to do.

22:24.057 --> 22:26.057
Very good.

22:28.937 --> 22:32.797
William, I've just heard what
happened. Are you OK? I'm fine.

22:33.877 --> 22:36.137
You've been avoiding me.

22:37.717 --> 22:39.117
No, no, I haven't.

22:41.477 --> 22:43.637
I do have to go.

22:45.337 --> 22:51.257
We could ride together. I could
drop you around to your house.
I would like that. Wonderful.

22:57.317 --> 23:02.357
It was no one thing,
a cumulative effect perhaps,

23:02.357 --> 23:04.497
the realisation that...

23:04.497 --> 23:09.257
I only ever work on dead people,
that my hands heal no one.

23:09.257 --> 23:12.597
But why not simply apply at
a hospital here in Toronto?

23:12.597 --> 23:14.857
Why go all the way to Buffalo?

23:14.857 --> 23:16.917
Because no-one is
offering me anything here.

23:16.917 --> 23:19.677
That could change.

23:19.677 --> 23:22.317
Do you really believe that, William?

23:28.797 --> 23:30.717
We're here.

23:41.497 --> 23:43.637
How odd.

23:43.637 --> 23:48.457
My badge must have become
magnetised when the magnetic
field was distorted.

23:55.677 --> 23:58.457
Be careful, William.

24:06.157 --> 24:09.117
This is an unexpected
surprise, Detective.

24:09.117 --> 24:12.457
I am terribly sorry to intrude
on your privacy like this.

24:14.837 --> 24:17.817
If you would just tell me
what you're looking for,
I'm sure I could help.

24:17.817 --> 24:22.377
We believe your husband
has mounted the weapon
on top of a vehicle of some sort.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.537
I'm hoping to learn
anything I can about it.

24:24.537 --> 24:29.737
He must have kept plans,
blueprints of some kind. I'm afraid
I've never seen anything like that.

24:33.037 --> 24:35.017
I can't believe I was
married to such a man.

24:35.017 --> 24:37.957
I'm so indebted to you, Detective.

24:37.957 --> 24:41.637
You owe me nothing.
I owe you everything.

24:43.397 --> 24:46.117
This one's locked,
any idea what's in there.

24:46.117 --> 24:48.157
I'm afraid not.
I've never opened it.

24:51.857 --> 24:53.437
No keyhole.

24:55.257 --> 24:56.817
I wonder if...

25:04.377 --> 25:07.077
Blueprints.

25:08.717 --> 25:11.277
James considered himself
to be some sort of engineer.

25:11.277 --> 25:14.137
He was always coming up with
silly little contraptions.

25:18.277 --> 25:21.657
There's nothing silly about
this one. May I take this?

25:21.657 --> 25:23.397
Of course.

25:25.817 --> 25:27.997
BANGING

25:27.997 --> 25:29.817
Mr Tesla?

25:29.817 --> 25:32.137
Mr Tesla, what on earth?

25:32.137 --> 25:35.377
I forgot to mention that the
microwaves are reflected by metal.

25:35.377 --> 25:37.477
Sir, Mr Tesla believes that
these holes will scatter

25:37.477 --> 25:40.337
the incoming energy yet still
allow us to see through.

25:40.337 --> 25:42.617
Your constable has been
an eager student.

25:42.617 --> 25:48.437
Sirs, if this energy
could be harnessed safely,
you could cook a potato in minutes.

25:48.437 --> 25:53.437
Yams would be delicious.
Yes, but such a machine
would be the size of a small room.

25:53.437 --> 25:55.397
Yes, George, highly impractical.

25:55.397 --> 26:00.797
Yes, sirs, but perhaps the future
will allow for every home
to have a potato cooking room.

26:02.897 --> 26:06.197
Mr Tesla,
I have something to show you.

26:06.197 --> 26:07.977
How wonderful.

26:07.977 --> 26:10.037
The undercarriage alone
would be extraordinary.

26:10.037 --> 26:12.657
I found this in Mr Pendrick's study.

26:12.657 --> 26:16.277
I believe this vehicle was
built to carry the weapon.

26:16.277 --> 26:19.577
Detective, this could definitely
transport the microwave weapon.

26:19.577 --> 26:23.737
Mr Tesla, do you think you could
compile a list of materials
required to build such a vehicle?

26:23.737 --> 26:27.857
With pleasure. Excellent.
George, please follow through
with that list.

26:27.857 --> 26:31.217
Will do, sir. Henry, bring Mr
Pendrick back here immediately.

26:31.217 --> 26:32.837
That could be difficult, sir.

26:32.837 --> 26:35.197
James Pendrick just escaped while
being transported back to Don Jail.

26:35.197 --> 26:38.757
What?
He used a pin to pick the lock on his
handcuffs and overcame his escort.

26:38.757 --> 26:41.837
No doubt on his way to
rendezvous with Karnaki.

26:41.837 --> 26:45.717
Henry, begin a search for
Mr Pendrick immediately.

26:45.717 --> 26:51.817
Right away, sir. And you? Mr Pendrick
already tried to kill his wife once,
he may want to finish the job.

27:20.317 --> 27:23.077
Hello?

27:24.377 --> 27:26.537
DOOR OPENS

27:49.657 --> 27:51.157
Mrs Pendrick?

27:58.997 --> 28:00.457
Mrs Pendrick?

28:03.317 --> 28:04.757
Sally?

28:10.357 --> 28:11.677
Hello, Detective.

28:13.517 --> 28:16.357
It seems we're looking
for the same thing.

28:19.797 --> 28:25.517
Mr Pendrick, what have you done with
your wife? I don't know how many
times I have to tell you, Murdoch,

28:25.517 --> 28:28.917
I would never hurt anyone without
provocation, least of all my wife.

28:30.477 --> 28:33.757
Then why are you aiming a gun at me?
Well, I don't know.

28:33.757 --> 28:39.417
Maybe because I'm a fugitive,
you're a police officer and
I'll be hanged if you bring me in.

28:39.417 --> 28:44.457
I meant if you are innocent
of your crimes, as you claim,
this is no way to convince me.

28:44.457 --> 28:47.157
It'll do for now.

28:47.157 --> 28:52.817
I came home one last time
to try to convince her of my
innocence before I ran for good.

28:52.817 --> 28:57.477
I found the house empty,
my staff gone and no sign of her.

28:57.477 --> 29:01.117
I half thought I might find
her with you by now.

29:01.117 --> 29:06.577
Mr Pendrick, I can assure you,
my heart is with someone else.

29:06.577 --> 29:11.117
But like you I find your
wife's absence disturbing.

29:11.117 --> 29:14.697
Perhaps she's in
some kind of trouble.

29:14.697 --> 29:18.277
Holding a gun on me
isn't going to help her.

29:22.737 --> 29:24.197
I'm a fool.

29:28.197 --> 29:32.397
Mr Pendrick, I want the truth, what
is your involvement in this affair?

29:39.697 --> 29:41.357
Sally's purse.

29:43.657 --> 29:47.257
My badge must
have become magnetised when the
magnetic field was distorted.

29:47.257 --> 29:50.357
It's...magnetised.

29:50.357 --> 29:54.257
It would have had to have
been exposed to an enormous
electro-magnetic source.

29:54.257 --> 29:57.497
Like a... Microwave death ray.

29:57.497 --> 29:59.657
That's ridiculous.

29:59.657 --> 30:03.317
Sally would have had to have
been near it when it was fired.

30:03.317 --> 30:06.737
She knew we were looking
for it in a Pendrick building.

30:09.757 --> 30:11.917
Perhaps she set the trap.

30:11.917 --> 30:15.837
What? She wasn't involved.
She couldn't be.

30:15.837 --> 30:20.397
Mr Pendrick, your wife was
with you when you met Mr Tesla in
New York, was she not? Of course.

30:20.397 --> 30:24.077
She could easily have come
in contact with Karnaki then.

30:30.857 --> 30:33.037
What are you saying?

30:34.417 --> 30:37.417
If we arrived just
a moment earlier... Indeed.

30:37.417 --> 30:42.157
Was it just fortuitous timing that
your wife survived the explosion?

30:42.157 --> 30:45.757
Or was she spared because
she knew precisely when
the bomb was to go off?

30:45.757 --> 30:49.577
And the pornographer? McTavish.

30:49.577 --> 30:52.377
He threatened to expose her past.

30:52.377 --> 30:57.037
Did she kill him,
and make it appear as though
you wanted the two of them dead?

30:57.037 --> 30:59.917
And there's the art theft.

30:59.917 --> 31:04.337
For some time now,
I've suspected a mastermind
to be behind the art theft.

31:04.337 --> 31:08.337
Someone with intimate knowledge
of the evening's events
as well as the building itself.

31:08.337 --> 31:11.497
Your wife was privy
to such information.

31:11.497 --> 31:13.797
When you saved my life,

31:13.797 --> 31:17.497
you prevented Carducci from
revealing Sally as the mastermind.

31:19.397 --> 31:21.177
Why would she do this?

31:21.177 --> 31:23.597
I don't know.

31:23.597 --> 31:28.017
But it would appear
we've both fallen victim
to an expert fraudster.

31:28.017 --> 31:31.477
All along,
you were holding the wrong suspect?

31:31.477 --> 31:33.597
That's completely unacceptable,
gentlemen.

31:36.357 --> 31:40.337
Worst of all,
I have it on good authority
that the weapon has been sold.

31:40.337 --> 31:45.597
I would have thought the Canadian
government would spend whatever
necessary... Well, they didn't!

31:45.597 --> 31:50.397
It is to be transported out of
the city before sunrise and,
no, I do not know from where.

31:54.937 --> 31:58.737
Sally Pendrick, the whole time.
I don't know what to say, sir.

31:58.737 --> 32:02.737
There's no mystery to it, Murdoch.
She used her feminine charms on you.

32:02.737 --> 32:06.157
You were blinkered, Murdoch.
I find it difficult to accept.

32:06.157 --> 32:09.017
That's because your
pride's been wounded.

32:09.017 --> 32:12.637
You never thought you'd meet
anyone cagey enough to outfox you.

32:12.637 --> 32:14.697
Cheer up, Murdoch.

32:14.697 --> 32:17.597
Women are a troubling
species at the best of times.

32:17.597 --> 32:22.317
My guess is she's feeling
very smug at this moment.

32:22.317 --> 32:24.997
You might have her
right where you want her.

32:24.997 --> 32:26.477
Thank you, sir.

32:32.977 --> 32:37.997
Where are we, George? The city is
being scoured for Mrs Pendrick
as we speak. So far, no luck.

32:37.997 --> 32:40.937
She no doubt had plans to leave
town the moment she sold the weapon.

32:40.937 --> 32:44.117
Have men guard the train station
and the docks. Already posted, sir.

32:44.117 --> 32:45.857
And where is Mr Tesla?

32:45.857 --> 32:51.757
He was last seen exiting
with that shield,
muttering about wavelengths.

32:51.757 --> 32:55.397
Oh, sir, we contacted the police
in Albany as per your request.

32:55.397 --> 32:59.277
They seem to think that our Sally
Pendrick may be their Sally Hubbard,

32:59.277 --> 33:01.817
a notorious fraudster
south of the border.

33:01.817 --> 33:04.457
What about her home
town of Montreal?

33:04.457 --> 33:06.837
There's no record of her
ever having lived there, sir.

33:06.837 --> 33:09.417
Of course not. Who is she, really?

33:11.077 --> 33:14.017
Sally never wanted
to discuss her past.

33:14.017 --> 33:18.057
She said she'd done things she wasn't
proud of and I chose not to ask.

33:20.277 --> 33:22.377
I loved her that much.

33:24.097 --> 33:27.917
But now it seems I
knew nothing about her.

33:27.917 --> 33:29.977
I've spoken with my bankers.

33:29.977 --> 33:34.517
My accounts have been emptied
over the past six months,
mostly since my incarceration.

33:34.517 --> 33:37.217
Six months ago,

33:37.217 --> 33:41.257
roughly when Mr Tesla approached
you about funding his experiments.

33:41.257 --> 33:45.297
Then, shortly after that,
the Rembrandt robbery occurred.

33:45.297 --> 33:47.017
What are you suggesting?

33:47.017 --> 33:50.737
Sally needed money
to fund Mr Karnaki's work.

33:50.737 --> 33:56.077
Secretly she had been stealing small
amounts from you, but she needed
more and didn't want to alert you.

33:56.077 --> 33:58.477
So she staged the art robbery.

33:58.477 --> 34:01.897
Yes, but when that went wrong she
still needed more money from you.

34:01.897 --> 34:04.557
And to do that she
needed me out of the way.

34:06.157 --> 34:08.877
Damned clever.
Between the art robbery

34:08.877 --> 34:12.917
and this whole eugenics affair,
I was predisposed to suspect you.

34:12.917 --> 34:18.757
Then when Mr McTavish come back into
her life she saw it as the perfect
opportunity to frame you and I...

34:20.317 --> 34:22.377
..was only too willing to assist.

34:22.377 --> 34:25.617
Leaving her free to
finance her project.

34:25.617 --> 34:28.697
I am so sorry, Mr Pendrick.

34:28.697 --> 34:30.417
For everything.

34:30.417 --> 34:34.277
It's not your fault, Detective.
The question now is how to stop her.

34:34.277 --> 34:36.637
Indeed.

34:38.197 --> 34:40.817
I despise that I still love her.

34:40.817 --> 34:43.437
Even after everything?

34:45.397 --> 34:47.597
Yes.

34:47.597 --> 34:50.956
I always hoped to find
somebody that shared my passion...

34:52.556 --> 34:55.996
..someone that loved me
in spite of my foibles.

34:58.257 --> 34:59.717
How tragic.

35:09.237 --> 35:13.517
I hoped I'd find you here.
William, I didn't think I'd
see you under the circumstances.

35:13.517 --> 35:18.297
Julia, nothing in this world
means more to me than you.

35:19.757 --> 35:24.497
William. I believed
you felt the same for me.

35:24.497 --> 35:27.157
But I do.

35:27.157 --> 35:29.337
Then I simply don't understand.

35:29.337 --> 35:33.657
There must be something you're not
telling me. Why are you leaving?

35:33.657 --> 35:36.437
Julia, please.

35:36.437 --> 35:37.957
I have to know.

35:39.537 --> 35:40.997
Very well.

35:44.457 --> 35:48.357
Ever since the kidnapping
of the inspector's son,

35:48.357 --> 35:52.497
it's been clear to me how much
you want a family, but...

35:52.497 --> 35:54.517
My abortion.

35:54.517 --> 35:56.697
That means nothing to me.

35:56.697 --> 35:59.417
We've put it in the past.

35:59.417 --> 36:01.957
William, it left me sterile.

36:04.177 --> 36:07.217
I should have told you before now,

36:07.217 --> 36:11.617
but I was frightened of losing you

36:11.617 --> 36:17.977
to something I couldn't control
and so I decided
to assert control myself.

36:17.977 --> 36:20.237
By leaving.

36:20.237 --> 36:22.777
It's for the best.

36:22.777 --> 36:24.677
Isn't it?

36:24.677 --> 36:28.397
This way you can meet a woman who
can give you the life you deserve.

36:32.557 --> 36:35.157
William, please say something.

36:35.157 --> 36:38.117
I don't know what to say.

36:39.897 --> 36:42.997
Yes... Well, that says it all.

36:44.057 --> 36:46.137
Doesn't it? No...

36:48.277 --> 36:49.337
Sir,

36:49.337 --> 36:52.397
I think we have something.

36:52.397 --> 36:54.297
Yes, George.

36:57.677 --> 37:00.037
I have to go.

37:01.837 --> 37:03.657
Yes.

37:13.477 --> 37:15.577
Isn't this the address
of the old tannery?

37:15.577 --> 37:17.297
Yes, sir. Abandoned now I believe.

37:17.297 --> 37:21.557
But nearly everything on Mr
Tesla's list was delivered to that
address in the last few months.

37:21.557 --> 37:23.577
I should have realised, George.

37:23.577 --> 37:27.137
If Mr Pendrick was behind this,
he would never have used
one of his own buildings.

37:27.137 --> 37:29.617
This must be where
they house the weapon.

37:29.617 --> 37:31.297
What have we here?

37:31.297 --> 37:35.377
Detective Murdoch,
a silver-coated aluminium shield.

37:35.377 --> 37:40.877
The silver's heavy concentration
of electrons is highly reflective
of micro-waves, you see.

37:40.877 --> 37:43.877
Mr Tesla believes that this
will repel the death ray.

37:43.877 --> 37:47.017
Very good. There's no time to waste.
Sir, I should come with you.

37:47.017 --> 37:49.217
Thank you, George,
it's far too dangerous,

37:49.217 --> 37:53.517
especially since I almost
got you, the inspector
and Mr Tesla killed last time.

37:53.517 --> 37:55.897
But sir...
 Constable, no.

37:57.497 --> 37:59.977
Well, take this.

37:59.977 --> 38:03.697
Good thinking, George. Sir, what
about the horse, he has no shield?

38:03.697 --> 38:06.117
I'll take care of him.
Good luck, Detective.

38:06.117 --> 38:09.497
I am confident the windscreen
will work...in theory.

38:11.857 --> 38:12.817
Hup!

38:16.557 --> 38:20.077
We can't let him go alone. Mr Tesla,
stay here, I'll fetch the Inspector.

38:30.317 --> 38:32.997
Come on. Move it!

38:32.997 --> 38:35.817
We're due at the dock.
It is ready, Mrs Pendrick.

38:35.817 --> 38:38.197
You two, you've been paid,
what are you standing around for?

38:38.197 --> 38:39.937
Lock it up, Karnaki.

38:39.937 --> 38:43.137
Our friends from Istanbul
won't wait. Yes, Mrs Pendrick.

38:43.137 --> 38:46.597
And, Karnaki, never call me
that name again.

38:52.877 --> 38:54.897
Would you prefer Sally Hubbard?

38:54.897 --> 38:56.617
Detective Murdoch.

38:59.637 --> 39:02.457
Both of you down.

39:02.457 --> 39:06.157
Such a fuss over a silly gun.

39:06.157 --> 39:10.217
Why build this abomination? You
were surrounded by so much wealth.

39:10.217 --> 39:14.597
The challenge, William. We all need
something to live for, don't we?

39:14.597 --> 39:18.837
For you, it used to be
a certain pathologist.

39:18.837 --> 39:21.237
Now it could be me.

39:22.417 --> 39:24.937
So everything was a deception.

39:24.937 --> 39:29.457
Mr Pendrick... Sally, was
there no truth to our marriage?

39:30.477 --> 39:32.617
The life we built together?

39:32.617 --> 39:36.417
James, this isn't a good time.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.977
Mr Pendrick,
I urge you to step back.

39:40.537 --> 39:42.837
I loved you.

39:42.837 --> 39:45.977
I would have given you everything.

39:45.977 --> 39:49.237
I did give you everything.
Doesn't that mean something to you?

39:49.237 --> 39:51.157
No.

39:52.217 --> 39:54.317
Mr Pendrick!

39:54.317 --> 39:56.577
MACHINE WHIRRS TO LIFE

39:58.357 --> 39:59.397
Ha!

40:04.077 --> 40:06.357
I'm fine, Murdoch, go stop her.

40:12.337 --> 40:14.477
Agh! Ha!

40:23.377 --> 40:25.057
Ha!

40:27.097 --> 40:28.597
Ya! Ya!

40:28.597 --> 40:29.797
Ya!

40:36.037 --> 40:37.957
He's gaining on us! Kill him!

40:51.557 --> 40:53.657
Agh!

41:05.357 --> 41:07.137
What a God awful mess.

41:07.137 --> 41:09.817
Destroyed beyond all use, sir.

41:09.817 --> 41:12.257
Shame, isn't it, Mr Meyers?

41:12.257 --> 41:15.397
It is, sir. I'll never figure
out how those yams will turn out.

41:21.457 --> 41:26.617
Well done, Detective.
What's all this, Meyers,
I thought you'd be in tears.

41:26.617 --> 41:31.957
Inspector,
believe it or not there are things
that even I believe shouldn't exist.

41:31.957 --> 41:33.937
Excuse me, gentlemen.

41:33.937 --> 41:38.097
Of course, if Mr Tesla here were
to help us build another one...

41:39.637 --> 41:41.797
This has been a trying day.

41:41.797 --> 41:45.497
I'm afraid it's not quite over yet.
Now what?

41:45.497 --> 41:50.737
We pulled Mr Karnaki's body from
the wreckage, but I'm afraid your
wife's was nowhere to be found.

41:53.957 --> 41:58.677
She escaped?
She is surprisingly resourceful.

41:59.717 --> 42:02.297
She no doubt had a contingency plan.

42:04.737 --> 42:08.377
What will you do?
I have nothing left.

42:08.377 --> 42:10.777
I'm free to start over.

42:10.777 --> 42:12.837
But on what?

42:12.837 --> 42:17.257
Well, we'll see
what catches my fancy.

42:18.857 --> 42:21.397
I trust our paths will
cross again, Detective.

42:21.397 --> 42:22.997
I look forward to it, Mr Pendrick.

42:46.157 --> 42:47.697
Julia.

42:47.697 --> 42:49.317
William.

42:49.317 --> 42:53.997
As long as you exist in this world,
there will be no other woman for me.

42:53.997 --> 42:57.537
William, I know, but... We can adopt.

42:57.537 --> 43:01.637
So many children need a good home,
all I need is you.

43:06.257 --> 43:09.057
Julia Ogden, will you marry me?

43:11.957 --> 43:13.137
Yes.

43:13.137 --> 43:15.697
Yes, of course I'll marry you.

43:22.957 --> 43:25.497
It's beautiful.

43:25.497 --> 43:27.457
'It's beautiful. It's beautiful.'

43:34.957 --> 43:36.437
Julia!

43:38.317 --> 43:41.797
She's gone to the train.
And who are you?

44:25.137 --> 44:28.037
BELL RINGS

44:40.037 --> 44:42.137
No! Julia!

46:36.217 --> 46:38.197
