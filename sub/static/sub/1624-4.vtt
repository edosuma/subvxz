WEBVTT

00:02.545 --> 00:04.506
Evening, hot chocolate.

00:05.160 --> 00:07.856
Max, we got big trouble from Little China.

00:08.463 --> 00:09.549
Hi, Max.

00:10.613 --> 00:11.524
Big trouble?

00:11.644 --> 00:15.014
There's nothing big about him. He looks
like a *** in a bear claw machine.

00:16.018 --> 00:19.718
Max, what is the worst sentence you
ever want to come out of Han's mouth?

00:20.057 --> 00:21.353
I got you pregnant?

00:24.085 --> 00:26.023
Come on, bad, bad.

00:26.143 --> 00:27.762
I got you pregnant again?

00:29.653 --> 00:31.582
I'm putting in karaoke.

00:31.702 --> 00:33.403
No! No!

00:35.189 --> 00:36.146
Han...

00:36.590 --> 00:40.757
Those guys better be up there because we're
officially putting ass crack on the menu.

00:42.245 --> 00:45.198
I am adding a TV to bring
in more customers.

00:45.318 --> 00:48.105
We can have theme nights,
Ultimate Fighter nights,

00:48.225 --> 00:50.843
Real Housewives of Bravo City nights,

00:50.963 --> 00:53.861
and best of all, karaoke night.

00:54.933 --> 00:56.859
You can't get hispters on microphone.

00:56.979 --> 00:59.912
That's like throwing fire
on a pretentious fire.

01:01.282 --> 01:03.511
Hipsters like karaoke.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.524
Replace the word "like"

01:05.644 --> 01:06.668
with the word "Hitler"

01:06.788 --> 01:08.666
and you got the three
worst things in history.

01:09.536 --> 01:11.929
Max, I hear what you say, but

01:12.049 --> 01:14.736
everybody else say "he-ey!"

01:14.856 --> 01:16.450
All my single ladies!

01:18.190 --> 01:27.285
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrected by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:29.485 --> 01:31.481
Okay. Next person
is going to sing

01:31.601 --> 01:33.453
<i>Teenage Dream</i> by Katy Perry,

01:33.573 --> 01:36.290
who is pretty now but used to
have very horrible acne.

01:36.292 --> 01:40.407
This is the third
<i>Teenage Dream</i> in 45 minutes.

01:40.527 --> 01:42.963
Why don't I just close my nuts
in the cashier's drawer?

01:45.975 --> 01:48.376
Come on up now,
girl named "Stacey."

01:48.378 --> 01:50.345
I got this.

01:50.347 --> 01:52.814
Look, I don't know you,
but I like you.

01:52.816 --> 01:54.432
And I respect both hair choices.

01:54.434 --> 01:57.185
I hate karaoke.

01:57.187 --> 01:59.904
I can't afford to have
any more hate in my head.

01:59.906 --> 02:02.324
My hate is at capacity.

02:02.326 --> 02:07.979
Sit this one out,
I'll comp your cobbler.

02:07.981 --> 02:09.781
What did you do?

02:09.782 --> 02:13.401
I saved Earl's nuts.

02:13.403 --> 02:16.204
Pick up! Hot food. Pick up.

02:16.206 --> 02:17.238
Calm your bells down, Oleg.

02:17.240 --> 02:18.740
Not my stations.

02:18.742 --> 02:19.741
Where's Caroline?

02:19.743 --> 02:20.908
Would it make you jealous

02:20.910 --> 02:23.795
if I said she was
back here with me?

02:23.797 --> 02:25.547
Jealous?
No.

02:25.549 --> 02:26.931
Pissed?
Probably, because we're busy

02:26.933 --> 02:28.433
and it would take me
all that time

02:28.435 --> 02:31.686
to get the duct tape
off her mouth and hands.

02:31.688 --> 02:34.255
What are you doin' in here,
snow white?

02:34.257 --> 02:35.423
If you're lookin'
for one of your dwarves,

02:35.425 --> 02:37.442
he's out there,
holding the mic.

02:37.444 --> 02:39.027
Look, my bite is off.

02:39.029 --> 02:40.312
See, I did the bite test.

02:40.314 --> 02:42.280
The number seven incisor is
crossing over number nine.

02:42.282 --> 02:44.816
Hold up. You know
the names of your teeth?

02:44.818 --> 02:46.384
Don't you?

02:46.386 --> 02:48.403
I don't even know
the name of my father.

02:48.405 --> 02:50.271
Ow, I just bit my tongue.

02:50.273 --> 02:53.158
Ah! Number 12 just joined
the party.

02:53.160 --> 02:55.543
I'd stop doing that right now.

03:03.336 --> 03:07.288
You just made it
into Oleg's spank bank.

03:07.290 --> 03:09.924
Congratulations.

03:12.645 --> 03:14.763
What am I gonna do
without my bite guard?

03:14.765 --> 03:16.581
My teeth don't know where to go.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.767
Well, maybe the should just
backpack for a couple of years,

03:18.769 --> 03:20.134
so they figure it out.

03:20.136 --> 03:22.904
Listen, perfect teeth,

03:22.906 --> 03:24.272
this is a nightmare for me.

03:24.274 --> 03:26.908
The technical term for this is
"advanced bruxism."

03:26.910 --> 03:29.694
And the technical term for you
is "overly dramatic."

03:29.696 --> 03:32.497
Yesterday you freaked out 'cause
we were out of toilet paper.

03:32.499 --> 03:35.784
Just hold it till you get
to work like everybody else.

03:37.503 --> 03:40.004
Now, maybe I sing
while others wait.

03:40.006 --> 03:42.257
Uh-oh.
We got real problems now.

03:42.259 --> 03:44.509
I choose Susan Boyle
popular song

03:44.511 --> 03:45.794
from all clips on Internet.

03:45.796 --> 03:50.331
It's called <i>I Dream--</i>

03:50.333 --> 03:53.618
Keep dreaming.

03:59.692 --> 04:00.775
Oh, you're back.

04:00.777 --> 04:02.444
We thought you ran away.

04:02.446 --> 04:04.178
Chestnut and I were
just about to pick out

04:04.180 --> 04:07.031
another human from the shelter.

04:07.033 --> 04:08.983
I had quite a day.

04:08.985 --> 04:10.835
8:00 to 10:00...
Grind, grind, pain.

04:10.837 --> 04:12.987
10:00 to 11:00...
Pain, pain, grind.

04:12.989 --> 04:14.021
So I went to the drug store

04:14.023 --> 04:15.290
and bought an $8 bite guard,

04:15.292 --> 04:18.041
which didn't fit
my freaky Tim Burton mouth.

04:18.043 --> 04:19.878
And when I tried to return it,

04:19.880 --> 04:20.962
the cashier, Rhonda,

04:20.964 --> 04:22.547
whose nametag said
she was happy to help,

04:22.549 --> 04:25.032
but who was neither happy
nor helpful,

04:25.034 --> 04:26.701
said that I couldn't return it

04:26.703 --> 04:29.304
because it had already
touched my "teef."

04:29.306 --> 04:31.756
For someone whose jaw
is about to unhinge,

04:31.758 --> 04:33.758
you're sure flapping it a lot.

04:33.760 --> 04:37.378
Why is this rag
with my father on it here?

04:37.380 --> 04:40.148
Don't look at me.
Chestnut bought it.

04:40.150 --> 04:44.051
He likes it when I read him
his daily horse-oscope.

04:44.053 --> 04:46.488
Why is everybody so obsessed
with the fact that

04:46.490 --> 04:47.689
he hasn't said anything?

04:47.691 --> 04:49.724
Haven't you ever been
at a loss for words?

04:49.726 --> 04:52.827
Tampons, yes.
Words, nah.

04:52.829 --> 04:55.113
Well, this will
make me feel better.

04:55.115 --> 04:57.398
Whenever I'm in pain,
I need a treat.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.918
You know, whenever you're
in pain, that is my treat.

04:59.920 --> 05:04.739
Sushi!
I hope you like crab roll.

05:04.741 --> 05:06.240
I never had sushi.

05:06.242 --> 05:09.711
That doesn't even make sense.

05:09.713 --> 05:13.515
No sushi, no dentist...
Who are you?

05:13.517 --> 05:16.584
A poor person.

05:16.586 --> 05:18.853
Sushi's lazy.

05:18.855 --> 05:20.054
If I come to your restaurant,

05:20.056 --> 05:23.308
get up off your ass
and cook the damn fish.

05:23.310 --> 05:26.060
I wish we could afford to go
to this little sushi place

05:26.062 --> 05:28.746
in Tribeca where
my father always took me.

05:28.748 --> 05:30.031
We had this little joke.

05:30.033 --> 05:31.983
Every time we'd walk in,
I'd always say...

05:35.655 --> 05:38.573
And we would just laugh!

05:38.575 --> 05:42.794
So you're not funny
in Japanese either.

05:42.796 --> 05:45.547
I got this at a corner deli.

05:45.549 --> 05:46.548
The cashier was Japanese.

05:46.550 --> 05:47.782
She said it was good.

05:47.784 --> 05:49.417
Oh,
I'm sure it's great.

05:49.419 --> 05:51.052
'Cause
the disenfranchised immigrant

05:51.054 --> 05:52.453
serving the spoiled white girl

05:52.455 --> 05:54.756
would have no reason to lie.

05:54.758 --> 05:57.425
Get ready
for something heavenly!

06:01.897 --> 06:03.014
That's not heaven.

06:03.016 --> 06:04.131
- Spit it out.
- Ugh!

06:04.133 --> 06:06.351
Ugh!

06:06.353 --> 06:07.468
What a disappointment.

06:07.470 --> 06:08.987
Your first time.

06:08.989 --> 06:13.157
Well, that's kinda the way
it goes with me and first times.

06:13.159 --> 06:15.410
Here, clean yourself off.

06:15.412 --> 06:17.477
That's exactly the way it goes!

06:19.000 --> 06:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:27.877 --> 06:29.394
It's not that bad.

06:29.396 --> 06:31.356
It's not that bad.
It's not that bad.

06:31.476 --> 06:32.360
No.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.076
For a dentist office
in the subway,

06:34.208 --> 06:35.664
it's pretty good.

06:36.621 --> 06:39.328
Seriously, how are you
not running out of here?

06:39.330 --> 06:40.963
I have no choice.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.881
Now that I have no money
or health insurance,

06:42.883 --> 06:45.884
I have to get used to
this third-world situation.

06:45.886 --> 06:47.869
Third-world situation?

06:47.871 --> 06:51.139
This is an underworld situation.

06:51.141 --> 06:52.391
Okay,
there's bulletproof glass.

06:52.393 --> 06:55.360
With a bullet in it.

06:55.362 --> 06:58.146
All right, so the glass works.

06:59.933 --> 07:02.651
It says to sign in.

07:05.388 --> 07:06.388
Look, why don't you just

07:06.390 --> 07:08.156
take some of our
cupcake business savings

07:08.158 --> 07:10.075
and go to a good dentist office?

07:10.077 --> 07:11.743
You know, one where you
won't get a staph infection

07:11.745 --> 07:13.561
just from looking at the floor.

07:13.563 --> 07:15.197
No, we can't do that.

07:15.199 --> 07:16.198
That's our future.

07:16.200 --> 07:17.199
Once we start doing that,

07:17.201 --> 07:20.786
it's a slippery slope.

07:20.788 --> 07:23.571
"Nicole Richie"?

07:26.575 --> 07:30.429
I don't want anyone to know
I was here.

07:30.431 --> 07:32.881
I know this situation
is less than ideal,

07:32.883 --> 07:35.267
but I am having
a dental emergency.

07:37.855 --> 07:42.941
No, <i>he's</i> having
a dental emergency.

07:45.144 --> 07:47.646
Come on, let's go over here
and see if this man can help me.

08:03.463 --> 08:07.249
Hi.

08:07.251 --> 08:10.085
Welcome to Subway Smiles.

08:11.805 --> 08:17.809
I told ya, we'll get to ya.

08:17.811 --> 08:19.344
I'm sorry, girls.

08:19.346 --> 08:21.396
I'm a little shaky.

08:21.398 --> 08:23.315
I was just shot at.

08:23.317 --> 08:26.968
I have a problem
with my teeth migrating.

08:26.970 --> 08:28.353
I have advanced bruxism.

08:28.355 --> 08:33.158
Ah.
I have hep C.

08:33.159 --> 08:37.496
Everybody's got
their something.

08:37.498 --> 08:38.530
What do you need?

08:38.532 --> 08:39.914
We need to be leaving.

08:39.917 --> 08:41.700
I just need a bite guard.

08:41.702 --> 08:44.202
Oh!
I can do that.

08:44.203 --> 08:46.922
That's where I squirt foam
into your mouth

08:46.924 --> 08:48.707
and make a mold.

08:48.709 --> 08:49.824
Come in the back.

08:49.826 --> 08:52.010
If you go back there with him,

08:52.012 --> 08:55.297
you'll need a bite guard
and a rape guard.

08:55.299 --> 08:56.681
You want the gas?

08:56.683 --> 08:58.216
Is that necessary?

08:58.218 --> 09:02.054
You're gonna want the gas,
sweetheart.

09:02.056 --> 09:05.340
Let's get outta here.

09:09.812 --> 09:11.530
One more song before we close.

09:11.532 --> 09:13.065
I sing Spice Girls'

09:13.067 --> 09:14.516
<i>Aww, tell me what you want,</i>

09:14.518 --> 09:17.736
<i>what you really, really want.</i>

09:17.738 --> 09:19.871
That boy's more stiff

09:19.873 --> 09:23.691
than Michele Bachmann's husband
at a Chippendales.

09:23.693 --> 09:27.579
I will give you the money
for trip to fancy dentist.

09:27.581 --> 09:29.915
Really?
Oleg, you would do that?

09:29.917 --> 09:31.583
It's favor I do for you.

09:31.585 --> 09:33.752
And at some point,
when I come to you for favor,

09:33.754 --> 09:36.338
you will say yes,
like I say yes now.

09:36.340 --> 09:39.641
Well, I'd need to know
what that favor might be.

09:39.643 --> 09:41.510
I can't say for sure.

09:41.512 --> 09:43.562
Will it be in a week
or a month?

09:43.564 --> 09:45.580
I can't say for sure.

09:45.582 --> 09:46.714
Will it be sexual?

09:46.716 --> 09:50.102
Yes, it will be.

09:50.104 --> 09:52.070
This I can say for sure.

09:52.072 --> 09:56.608
Thank you, but no.

09:56.610 --> 09:59.161
I am such an idiot.

09:59.163 --> 10:01.896
I like it.
Keep going.

10:01.898 --> 10:03.782
My bite guard is
just sitting in the bathroom

10:03.784 --> 10:04.732
of my townhouse.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.168
If I could only
get up on the roof,

10:06.170 --> 10:07.669
then I could break in
through the skylight

10:07.671 --> 10:09.704
like I used to when I snuck out
in high school.

10:09.706 --> 10:13.041
Hello, I'm Max.
Have we met?

10:13.043 --> 10:15.544
When I was 15, I paid
the security system guys extra

10:15.546 --> 10:17.045
to not wire the skylight,

10:17.047 --> 10:19.714
and then I snuck out and went
to Ilana Shapiro's Sweet 16...

10:19.716 --> 10:21.716
- Cute.
- In Greece.

10:21.718 --> 10:24.252
Hardcore.

10:24.254 --> 10:25.854
I used to sneak
out of the house

10:25.856 --> 10:29.024
and huff spray paint
with an ex-marine.

10:29.026 --> 10:31.276
And sometimes,
I'd just sneak out,

10:31.278 --> 10:34.429
look up at the stars,
and dream.

10:34.431 --> 10:36.013
And then you said that.

10:41.110 --> 10:43.456
See, I told you I can get this *** open.

10:43.576 --> 10:44.682
Turn on a light!

10:44.802 --> 10:47.915
Wait till I close
the closet door.

10:47.917 --> 10:50.067
Why are the floors so bouncy?

10:50.069 --> 10:52.586
It's called "carpet."

10:54.423 --> 10:56.173
What?

10:56.175 --> 10:59.343
No way.
No way.

10:59.345 --> 11:02.596
Is this Narnia?

11:02.598 --> 11:05.266
I'm about to say something
I swore I'd never say.

11:05.268 --> 11:08.569
O.M.G.

11:08.571 --> 11:10.104
Again...O.M.G.

11:10.106 --> 11:12.156
It's lame, but nothing else
really nails it.

11:12.158 --> 11:15.943
This is the room that O.M.G.
was born for.

11:15.945 --> 11:17.828
Max, it's just my closet.

11:17.830 --> 11:19.730
Your clothes have a house!

11:19.732 --> 11:22.083
Look, look!

11:22.085 --> 11:23.667
You are rich!

11:23.669 --> 11:25.319
Like, I know you've said
you were rich,

11:25.321 --> 11:28.122
but you are <i>rich.</i>

11:28.124 --> 11:29.874
You're embarrassing me.

11:29.876 --> 11:30.841
Are you crazy?

11:30.843 --> 11:32.960
This is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

11:32.962 --> 11:37.164
What's this do?

11:37.166 --> 11:39.300
Oh, my God.

11:39.302 --> 11:41.552
You have a shoe rotisserie.

11:41.554 --> 11:42.970
I designed it.

11:42.972 --> 11:45.856
I call it my
"Ferris Heels."

11:45.858 --> 11:48.642
I'd judge you
if that wasn't exactly what

11:48.644 --> 11:50.861
I'd call it if I had one.

11:50.863 --> 11:51.979
Okay, we should really go now.

11:51.981 --> 11:53.697
Lemme just grab my bite guard.

11:56.202 --> 11:59.987
What?

11:59.989 --> 12:03.124
You have a museum
in your closet?

12:03.126 --> 12:05.192
Come on, it's just a bathroom.

12:05.194 --> 12:06.911
Just a bathroom?

12:06.913 --> 12:10.464
It's the Louvre of pooping.

12:10.466 --> 12:14.218
Here it is.

12:17.005 --> 12:21.475
Ow. Ow. Ow.

12:21.477 --> 12:23.978
Oh, yeah.

12:23.980 --> 12:27.314
Do you two need
to be left alone?

12:27.316 --> 12:28.365
We have to go.

12:28.367 --> 12:30.317
Can't risk staying much longer.

12:30.319 --> 12:32.436
Wow.
Just when I thought your voice

12:32.438 --> 12:33.887
couldn't get any more grating.

12:33.889 --> 12:36.273
It'll loosen up.

12:36.275 --> 12:38.559
Oh.

12:41.396 --> 12:43.998
Seriously, we should go.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.918
Oh, um, I just have to do
one more thing before we go.

12:54.709 --> 12:57.344
I think me and your tub
are going steady.

12:57.346 --> 13:00.297
Oh, you found
the jacuzzi button.

13:00.299 --> 13:01.765
I don't know who found who,

13:01.767 --> 13:04.718
but we're together now.

13:04.720 --> 13:08.272
I'm totally stealing some
of these ridonculous bath soaps.

13:08.274 --> 13:10.107
This one's shaped like a vagina.

13:10.109 --> 13:11.892
Seashell.

13:11.894 --> 13:15.262
Sister, this is
a mint green vagina.

13:17.983 --> 13:20.284
Did you go to the prom
with your dad?

13:20.286 --> 13:22.269
That's my debutante dance,

13:22.271 --> 13:23.487
when I came out.

13:23.489 --> 13:24.771
Out?

13:24.773 --> 13:27.291
Like you came out
that you were dating your dad?

13:27.293 --> 13:28.909
Gross.

13:28.911 --> 13:33.731
I think I can still fit
a goose feather pillow in.

13:33.733 --> 13:37.784
Hey, what's this one of you
and Chestnut and your dad?

13:37.786 --> 13:39.136
Oh, that's when my dad

13:39.138 --> 13:40.638
bought Chestnut for me.

13:40.640 --> 13:43.474
It was my first-period present.

13:43.476 --> 13:46.793
Your dad got you a horse
for getting your period?

13:46.795 --> 13:49.930
O.M.G.

13:49.932 --> 13:52.132
Know how I celebrated
getting my period?

13:52.134 --> 13:53.851
Stole a painkiller
and half a beer

13:53.853 --> 13:55.986
from my mom's boyfriend.

13:55.988 --> 13:59.440
Wasn't a horse,
but it was pretty awesome.

14:00.442 --> 14:02.743
How come there are no pictures
of your mom?

14:02.745 --> 14:04.578
'Cause there aren't any.

14:04.580 --> 14:06.614
She cheated on my dad
when I was five,

14:06.616 --> 14:09.033
and my grandmother
got rid of her.

14:09.035 --> 14:10.417
Not in, like, a mob way.

14:10.419 --> 14:12.953
In a society way,
which is worse.

14:12.955 --> 14:14.588
So who raised you?

14:14.590 --> 14:19.159
Well, Estella from 1989 to '96.

14:19.161 --> 14:24.215
Then, Dominica from '97 until
she went back to Guatemala.

14:24.217 --> 14:27.000
Then no one.

14:27.002 --> 14:28.769
Funny.

14:28.771 --> 14:31.188
You didn't have a father, and I
didn't have a mother. So we're--

14:31.190 --> 14:33.140
Oh, we're alike?

14:33.142 --> 14:37.728
Look around.
We have nothing in common.

14:37.730 --> 14:39.196
Hey, what's this button for?

14:39.198 --> 14:40.814
Music.

14:40.816 --> 14:42.900
Oh, lemme guess.
Show tunes? Boy bands?

14:45.121 --> 14:48.455
Both: I love this song!

14:49.742 --> 14:52.076

15:28.698 --> 15:31.582
I knew what we had
in common wouldn't last.

15:31.584 --> 15:33.033
Were you crumping for a second?

15:33.035 --> 15:36.787
Maybe. Were you
tootsie-rolling for a second?

15:36.789 --> 15:40.557
Yes.

15:40.559 --> 15:42.026
Okay, get dressed.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.328
We really should go now.

15:44.330 --> 15:45.679
I have all the essentials.

15:45.681 --> 15:48.682
Tampons, toilet paper,
comforter, body shimmer.

15:48.684 --> 15:50.434
Wait, what about the clothes?

15:50.436 --> 15:51.535
Oh, what am I gonna do?

15:51.537 --> 15:53.804
Walk around Williamsburg
in a $3000 gown?

15:53.806 --> 15:56.557
Oh, my God.

15:56.559 --> 15:57.558
Wait a minute.

15:57.560 --> 15:59.360
Grab everything
with a price tag on it

15:59.362 --> 16:00.728
that we can resell.

16:00.730 --> 16:04.481
Or that you think
I'd look amazing in.

16:05.434 --> 16:07.318
Not the furs!
They're wired!

16:07.320 --> 16:09.069
Why would you wire the furs?

16:09.071 --> 16:12.740
Everybody wires the furs,
bitch!

16:12.742 --> 16:14.274
Security's gonna be here
in ten minutes.

16:14.276 --> 16:17.211
Just grab everything you can.

16:17.213 --> 16:21.281
Wait! How are we going to
carry it all back to Brooklyn?

16:30.124 --> 16:32.976
Jealous?

16:32.978 --> 16:35.896
Look, two seats.

16:45.657 --> 16:47.608
I think you got more stuff
than me.

16:47.610 --> 16:50.994
Well, you spent five minutes
saying good-bye to the tub.

16:52.781 --> 16:56.483
This was my fa purse
to take dancing.

16:56.485 --> 16:57.951
How'd you keep it
on your shoulder

16:57.953 --> 17:00.637
when you went all mad crump?

17:00.639 --> 17:03.791
Look.
$200!

17:03.793 --> 17:06.426
It's not enough we're sitting
on the subway in furs...

17:06.429 --> 17:08.262
You gotta make it rain?

17:08.263 --> 17:09.363
This is so exciting.

17:09.365 --> 17:11.832
It's going right
into our cupcake fund.

17:11.834 --> 17:14.685
- Or--
- Or what?

17:14.686 --> 17:17.387
Where was that place you
always went with your dad?

17:17.390 --> 17:20.523
Toro with black truffle.

17:20.526 --> 17:23.227
You are about to have
a sushi toro-gasm.

17:23.229 --> 17:25.479
Will you calm down?
It's just--

17:25.481 --> 17:30.117
Oh, sweet bejesus,
that's delicious!

17:30.119 --> 17:32.018
If this is sushi,

17:32.020 --> 17:33.353
what was that other stuff
we ate?

17:33.355 --> 17:35.906
Wrong.
On every level.

17:35.908 --> 17:37.574
We need more of this.

17:37.576 --> 17:38.575
Like, all of it.

17:38.577 --> 17:39.860
Can we have some more toro?

17:39.862 --> 17:40.861
Thank you so much.

17:40.863 --> 17:42.379
And, uh...

17:52.591 --> 17:55.208
I get it now 'cause I'm rich.

17:56.978 --> 18:00.180
I don't know how
you're pulling it off.

18:00.182 --> 18:01.181
What do you mean?

18:01.183 --> 18:04.101
Giving up everything
that you had.

18:04.103 --> 18:07.488
The maids, the closet,
the dentist, the sushi, the tub.

18:07.490 --> 18:11.108
All of it.
The tub.

18:11.110 --> 18:12.192
I almost can't give it up,

18:12.194 --> 18:14.745
but I only had it for an hour.

18:14.747 --> 18:17.030
You're kind of a badass.

18:17.032 --> 18:19.700
Max, you just called me
a badass.

18:19.702 --> 18:24.121
I'm drunk on black truffle.

18:26.926 --> 18:28.091
It's my dad!

18:28.093 --> 18:30.260
Wait, he actually exists?

18:30.262 --> 18:31.929
Like the townhouse and the tub?

18:31.931 --> 18:33.714
The tub.

18:33.716 --> 18:36.049
Hi, daddy.
How are you?

18:36.051 --> 18:38.519
I miss you so much.

18:38.521 --> 18:40.220
I'm good.
No, really.

18:40.222 --> 18:43.140
I'm still staying in Brooklyn
with my friend, Max.

18:43.142 --> 18:45.142
She's great.

18:45.144 --> 18:48.028
Oh!

18:48.030 --> 18:49.780
Oh, okay.
Hold on.

18:49.782 --> 18:51.097
Love you, daddy.

18:51.099 --> 18:52.282
He wants to talk to you.

18:52.284 --> 18:54.151
Me? Why?

18:54.153 --> 18:55.702
I wouldn't know what to say.

18:55.704 --> 19:00.324
Take it!
He's only allowed five minutes.

19:00.326 --> 19:06.046
Yo, what's up, Martin Channing?

19:06.048 --> 19:07.948
Oh.

19:07.950 --> 19:10.834
You're welcome, but I di--

19:10.836 --> 19:13.670
Well, thank you.

19:13.672 --> 19:15.172
Yeah, she's great.

19:15.174 --> 19:17.391
Real trooper.

19:17.393 --> 19:21.178
Well, bye.
What?

19:21.180 --> 19:24.348
Okay, I'll tell her.

19:24.350 --> 19:26.800
Daddy?

19:26.802 --> 19:28.802
He's gone.

19:28.804 --> 19:31.271
So that's what a father
sounds like.

19:31.273 --> 19:32.639
What did he say?

19:32.641 --> 19:36.777
He wanted me to remind you
to wear your bite guard.

19:36.779 --> 19:41.081
See, he can't be
as bad as everyone says.

19:41.083 --> 19:42.983
He just can't be.

19:47.756 --> 19:49.206
Oh, my God.

19:49.208 --> 19:51.508
The 200 didn't cover it.

19:51.510 --> 19:54.327
Start checking the purses!

19:54.329 --> 19:57.598
Oh, hey.
Do you take hats?

19:59.667 --> 20:03.136
Any cougars in the house?

20:03.138 --> 20:05.222
And in case you don't know,

20:05.224 --> 20:09.276
"cougar" means older lady
with a large sexual appetite.

20:09.278 --> 20:11.177
Lady past prime
with tight clothes

20:11.179 --> 20:14.180
who wants sex from young men.

20:14.182 --> 20:17.017
Max, what is the one thing
worse than karaoke?

20:17.019 --> 20:18.235
Oh, no.

20:18.237 --> 20:20.487
That's right.
Open mic night.

20:20.489 --> 20:22.406
Cougar also have face lift.

20:22.408 --> 20:24.124
From behind, look 22.

20:24.126 --> 20:25.876
She turn around, 72.

20:27.413 --> 20:28.862
It's true!

20:28.864 --> 20:32.165
It's funny 'cause it's true.

20:32.167 --> 20:33.417
Bad news.

20:33.419 --> 20:35.669
They heightened security
because we tripped the alarm.

20:35.671 --> 20:37.704
The entire townhouse
is locked down.

20:37.706 --> 20:38.705
We can never go back!

20:38.707 --> 20:40.090
My tub!

20:40.092 --> 20:44.011
Why does anything that gives me
pleasure wind up behind bars?

20:44.013 --> 20:45.211
Forget about the tub.

20:45.213 --> 20:46.730
Everything was inventoried.

20:46.732 --> 20:47.898
We can't sell the furs.

20:47.900 --> 20:48.899
I should've thought of that!

20:48.901 --> 20:49.929
Yeah, you should've.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.903
'Cause you know they always
inventory the furs, bitch!
