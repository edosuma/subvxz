00:04.397 --> 00:05.697
I'm not clingy.
Matty is.

00:05.699 --> 00:07.832
- Nice job, McKibben.
- What?

00:07.834 --> 00:10.100
You were totally
sabotaging them.

00:10.102 --> 00:11.536
Your dad left today.

00:11.538 --> 00:13.404
It's not just for a few days,
is it?

00:13.406 --> 00:14.339
No.

00:15.007 --> 00:17.408
Post my parents' separation,

00:17.410 --> 00:19.176
I'd spent a lot of time
playing the blame game.

00:19.178 --> 00:20.545
And nine times out of ten,

00:20.547 --> 00:22.780
the onus of their split
landed on me.

00:22.782 --> 00:25.616
I regretted ever saying anything
about the letter,

00:25.618 --> 00:27.485
and I was consumed with guilt.

00:27.487 --> 00:30.287
So I was willing
to be with anyone

00:30.289 --> 00:33.123
and do anything to avoid feeling
like a bad person.

00:33.125 --> 00:36.126
[Organ playing]

00:39.131 --> 00:41.098
My mom was also looking
for redemption.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.768
And while our relationship
was still on shaky ground,

00:43.770 --> 00:45.236
she needed
a little hand-holding,

00:45.238 --> 00:46.371
willing or otherwise.

00:46.373 --> 00:49.774
She wasn't good at being alone.

00:49.776 --> 00:53.444
Not that she excelled
at being in public either.

00:53.446 --> 00:56.848
Everyone, please open
your bibles to Psalm 46.

00:58.251 --> 01:01.586
Oh, no, thank you.

01:01.588 --> 01:04.489
I think we're
supposed to put money in.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.530
At least there was
one saving grace

01:12.532 --> 01:14.298
to getting up early
on a Sunday.

01:14.300 --> 01:17.502
[Upbeat music]

01:18.571 --> 01:20.271
This was enlightening,
but let's go

01:20.273 --> 01:22.573
before the welcome committee
takes us hostage.

01:22.575 --> 01:24.409
I probably should have tried
to save my mom,

01:24.411 --> 01:27.378
but sometimes,
you just have to save yourself.

01:30.482 --> 01:33.083
Check.

01:33.085 --> 01:35.219
Check.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.524

[Gasps] You have to come
to the retreat.

01:45.164 --> 01:48.599
On Saturday night, there's
a "Saints and Sinners" party

01:48.601 --> 01:52.369
that we secretly call
"haloed bros and biblical hos."

01:52.371 --> 01:55.406
And then on the Sunday,
Jesus forgives all your sins,

01:55.408 --> 01:57.542
and there's a taco party!

01:57.544 --> 01:59.877
- So you going to come?
- Hmm.

01:59.879 --> 02:01.378
What would Jenna do?

02:01.380 --> 02:03.714
I'm thinking about it.
[Gasps]

02:03.716 --> 02:04.849
And I was.

02:04.851 --> 02:07.117
Since my home no longer
felt like a safe haven,

02:07.119 --> 02:09.119
I was open to exploring gods.

02:09.121 --> 02:11.155
Maybe it was going
to be a new day.

02:11.157 --> 02:13.424
[Gasps] Pastor Don!
This is Jenna.

02:13.426 --> 02:15.626
She's the girl
we've been praying for.

Remember? The harlot
who stole my boyfriend.

You're going to church camp?
With Dim Sum?

02:30.309 --> 02:32.243
It's a retreat,
which I could really use,

02:32.245 --> 02:34.678
given all the chaos
going on with my parents.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.047
I think I need a little
spiritual guidance right now.

02:37.049 --> 02:38.916
Well, if they tell you
to drink the kool-aid

02:38.918 --> 02:41.185
- and take a nap, don't.
- It's a church, not a cult.

02:41.187 --> 02:43.888
If you want a retreat,
why not just hole up with me?

02:43.890 --> 02:47.124
I'm grounded for the weekend, so
we can do blah-di-na together.

02:47.126 --> 02:48.926
Thanks, but I really need
to clear my head.

What I'm going through
can't be fixed

02:50.529 --> 02:52.529

in a rom-com-athon.

02:52.531 --> 02:54.298
And why are you grounded?

02:54.300 --> 02:56.833
'Cause Ricky Schwartz got me

We broke up.

too much attention

03:05.912 --> 03:07.544

that type.

about you.

Apparently,
I wasn't the only one

03:26.698 --> 03:28.299
who had lost faith in myself.

for a little divine...

Why do I need an intervention?

Isn't forgiveness
Jesus's whole deal?

03:41.414 --> 03:43.948

hooker with the burning bush.

than I can say for you.

how attractive he is.

to have to compete

04:37.036 --> 04:38.735

for his attention.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.437
Do you think
he likes them young,

04:40.439 --> 04:42.973
or is he into ladies...
his own age?

04:42.975 --> 04:44.774
I don't know, and I don't care.

04:44.776 --> 04:47.011
What I want is for my parents
to get back together.

04:47.013 --> 04:49.413
I feel like their breakup
is my fault,

04:49.415 --> 04:51.281

question who I am.

into a higher power

will bring me some comfort,

It was kind of
about the doughnuts.

05:16.642 --> 05:18.008

Lured me in
with the sugary, fried treats,

05:20.779 --> 05:23.880
made me feel accepted,
and then, slowly but surely,

05:23.882 --> 05:25.949
I started judging anyone
who drank coke

05:25.951 --> 05:27.418
and didn't wear bloomers.

05:27.420 --> 05:29.886
It's a slippery slope, J.

05:29.888 --> 05:32.322
Religion is all about preying
on the weak,

05:32.324 --> 05:33.623

05:33.625 --> 05:36.993
You're an easy target.

05:36.995 --> 05:38.628
While I wasn't convinced

05:38.630 --> 05:40.297
that religion was
about exploiting the weak,

05:40.299 --> 05:43.033
in my vulnerable state,
I couldn't take the risk.

05:43.035 --> 05:45.269
I'd have to find another way
to soothe my soul.

05:45.271 --> 05:47.438
And if I wasn't going
to lean on Jesus,

05:47.440 --> 05:50.874
I'd lean on Jake.

checking you out.

out of this funk.

I will, I just need some time.

Please don't talk
about that girl again.

point of view on something.

- Nah, I don't.
- He does.

06:10.396 --> 06:12.796

on some lame girl.

06:12.798 --> 06:14.331
- I didn't say she was lame.
- No, I did.

If Matty was going to fixate
on a new girl,

06:16.302 --> 06:18.535
I'm glad Jake thought
she was lame.

06:18.537 --> 06:19.903
They've been flirting
and hooking up,

06:19.905 --> 06:21.171
and now she's totally
dissing him.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.173
To be fair,
been non-committal.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.841
Matty was up to his old tricks.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.243
And while I didn't want
to hear the details,

06:26.245 --> 06:28.044
it was nice to know
it wasn't about me.

06:28.046 --> 06:29.746
She's been leading him on
since the summer.

06:29.748 --> 06:31.448
So it was about me.

over break for some other dude.

06:33.685 --> 06:34.918
She's a bitch.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.019

you felt betrayed.

She's a bitch, right?

06:41.594 --> 06:42.926
She's a bitch.

06:42.928 --> 06:44.461

06:44.463 --> 06:46.863
Not only had I split up
my parents,

06:46.865 --> 06:49.933
but I'd come precariously close
to ending a friendship.

06:49.935 --> 06:52.202
Jake's judgment had only further
cemented my first instinct.

06:52.204 --> 06:55.939
I was a bad person,
and I needed to redeem myself.

06:55.941 --> 06:57.474

to all your problems.

A double date this weekend.
I'm going to fix you up.

07:09.588 --> 07:11.221
Are you sure you want
to do this?

07:11.223 --> 07:13.223
- Yes.
- But you don't know anybody.

07:13.225 --> 07:16.560
You're going to be alone.
You are not good at being alone.

07:16.562 --> 07:19.996
No, mom, that would be you.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.766
The retreat was exactly what
I needed to clear my conscience.

07:22.768 --> 07:25.535
People weren't judgey,
they were handsy.

07:25.537 --> 07:26.937
Ooh.

07:26.939 --> 07:28.905
And considering all the action
I was getting on the bus,

07:28.907 --> 07:30.273
there was a solid chance

07:30.275 --> 07:32.075
I would find comfort
being embraced

07:32.077 --> 07:36.345
by a community of loving,
affectionate--

07:36.347 --> 07:37.480

your mom's car

I came here for peace of mind,

drives a Prius?

07:58.522 --> 08:00.489
Kyle?
I-I don't know.

08:00.491 --> 08:01.791
So he could drive a Prius.

08:01.793 --> 08:03.059
I'm lost.
What are we talking about?

08:03.061 --> 08:05.761
Remember his shirt?
"Take it outside"?

08:05.763 --> 08:08.864
I realized where I know
that from-- my mouth.

08:08.866 --> 08:10.232
That's what I said
to Ricky Schwartz

08:10.234 --> 08:11.834
when I pulled my freak-a-deak
at the assembly.

08:11.836 --> 08:13.435
Kyle's moved on
from stalking you

08:13.437 --> 08:15.404
to stalking me!

08:15.406 --> 08:17.372
T., hold on a second.

08:19.442 --> 08:21.177
Continue.

08:21.179 --> 08:24.113
Under normal circumstances,
I'd be into having a creeper.

08:24.115 --> 08:25.848
But I went on Kyle's page,
and under interests,

08:25.850 --> 08:28.050
he has "take it outside"
as a club.

08:28.052 --> 08:30.052
He started a club, Jenna.

08:30.054 --> 08:31.420
Okay, the Kyle sitch
definitely warrants attention,

08:31.422 --> 08:33.089
but if I don't get
out of here soon,

I had somehow evolved too.
