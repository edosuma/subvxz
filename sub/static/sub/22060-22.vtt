WEBVTT

00:02.804 --> 00:04.971
It's not like
I lack for partners.

00:06.676 --> 00:08.542
Baez is a godsend.

00:08.544 --> 00:11.445
The boys are growing
into the role.

00:11.447 --> 00:13.447
My family--

00:13.449 --> 00:14.782
they always got my back.

00:14.784 --> 00:17.351
They're Reagans.
It's how we're raised.

00:18.954 --> 00:22.556
Keep trying to remind myself
I'm rich with partners, but

00:22.558 --> 00:25.993
you're the only one
that really matters.

00:28.997 --> 00:32.533
Putting on a real brave face
out here,

00:32.534 --> 00:34.869
but between me and you...

00:34.871 --> 00:37.671
I'm having a really
hard time, babe.

00:40.742 --> 00:43.010
I miss you.

00:46.516 --> 00:49.350
- Hey, Danny?
- Yup.

00:49.352 --> 00:51.552
- Time.
- Okay.

00:58.961 --> 01:01.162
Love you.

01:02.931 --> 01:05.933
Love you most.

01:11.673 --> 01:14.842
And while there's always room
for improvement, obviously,

01:14.844 --> 01:17.444
we're very pleased with the
results, as are the communities

01:17.446 --> 01:20.047
we've been focusing
these programs on.

01:20.049 --> 01:21.816
Commissioner Reagan?
Helen?

01:21.837 --> 01:23.469
Commissioner, can you comment

01:23.471 --> 01:25.605
on the five-million-dollar
settlements awarded

01:25.607 --> 01:27.874
to the so-called
"Prospect Park Six"?

01:28.909 --> 01:31.311
Well, those young men spent
nine years in prison

01:31.313 --> 01:33.313
for a crime they didn't commit.

01:33.315 --> 01:36.015
I don't know how you put a price

01:36.017 --> 01:37.984
on nine years of a life.

01:37.986 --> 01:39.919
If they're satisfied, I am.

01:39.921 --> 01:41.654
Do you feel
a personal responsibility?

01:41.656 --> 01:44.090
For those of you who were
not covering this office

01:44.092 --> 01:47.093
when the crime occurred, Helen
is referring to the fact that

01:47.095 --> 01:48.895
a gang rape took place

01:48.897 --> 01:51.931
the night after Commissioner
Reagan was sworn in.

01:51.933 --> 01:54.667
But have you reached out
personally to the six young men?

01:54.669 --> 01:56.502
Helen, we've
released statements

01:56.504 --> 01:57.615
at every juncture in
this case, leading...

01:57.616 --> 02:00.407
Yes, but the commissioner's own
perspective was not addressed

02:00.408 --> 02:02.709
in those statements.

02:02.711 --> 02:05.178
Yes.

02:05.180 --> 02:08.080
It happened on my watch, Helen.

02:08.083 --> 02:10.416
There was a lot
of solid evidence

02:10.418 --> 02:12.485
that could only be dismissed

02:12.487 --> 02:14.687
with the hindsight
of a confession

02:14.689 --> 02:17.290
years later
from the real perpetrator.

02:17.292 --> 02:20.159
And... no,

02:20.161 --> 02:22.762
I have not reached out
personally

02:22.764 --> 02:25.565
to those men,

02:25.567 --> 02:27.467
because...

02:27.469 --> 02:30.069
honestly,

02:30.071 --> 02:33.139
I can't imagine
what I could say...

02:33.141 --> 02:36.042
that would mean anything,

02:36.044 --> 02:38.278
and I still don't.

02:39.914 --> 02:41.814
That's all.

02:41.816 --> 02:44.183
Thank you. Good day.

02:49.790 --> 02:52.992
So you could hear him,
but you couldn't see him?

02:52.994 --> 02:55.962
Uh, he...
he pulled up to the curb

02:55.964 --> 02:58.164
and asked which one of us
was Ida Dooley.

02:58.166 --> 03:00.333
I-I couldn't see him.
He was a little ahead of us.

03:00.335 --> 03:02.168
Did he have an accent?
- No.

03:02.170 --> 03:03.403
He sounded white.

03:03.405 --> 03:04.771
Young? Old?

03:04.773 --> 03:06.940
Just white and a man.

03:06.942 --> 03:08.975
So Ida walked over to the car,

03:08.977 --> 03:12.178
and then, blam,
he shot her in the head.

03:12.180 --> 03:14.180
Okay.

03:14.182 --> 03:17.116
Do you remember
what kind of car it was?

03:17.118 --> 03:19.819
Black sedan.
Black or dark gray.

03:19.821 --> 03:21.921
Not the kind that
you take to the airport.

03:21.923 --> 03:24.290
No? Which kind, then?

03:24.292 --> 03:26.392
Foreign.

03:26.394 --> 03:27.927
Uh-huh.
- Like the kind

03:27.929 --> 03:30.663
you <i>rent</i> at the airport, maybe.

03:30.665 --> 03:32.532
I don't suppose you got
the license plate number?

03:32.534 --> 03:35.368
Are you kidding? Ida just had
her head blown off.

03:35.370 --> 03:36.936
Who'd notice
anything else?

03:36.938 --> 03:40.873
Okay. Look, we'd like to
interview you both again,

03:40.875 --> 03:42.875
so as soon as you feel up to it,

03:42.877 --> 03:45.378
things settle down,
would you give us a call?

03:45.380 --> 03:48.381
We'd be happy to come to you
if that makes things easier.

03:48.383 --> 03:50.383
I don't know when that'll be.

03:50.385 --> 03:52.418
Whenever you're up for it, okay?

03:52.420 --> 03:54.454
Thank you.

03:54.456 --> 03:56.856
Who puts a hit out
on an old lady named Ida?

03:56.858 --> 03:58.992
I don't have a clue.
This is a first.

03:58.994 --> 04:01.160
Life's rich pageant.

04:04.765 --> 04:07.266
All right, stand back!

04:07.268 --> 04:09.869
Hey, are you okay?
Yeah, but it's stuck.

04:09.871 --> 04:12.071
All right, all right. Hold on.

04:14.175 --> 04:15.441
Hey.

04:17.512 --> 04:19.512
Take it easy. Take it easy.

04:20.714 --> 04:23.149
Thank you, officers.

04:23.151 --> 04:25.485
Yeah. Hey. Whoa! Hey.

04:25.487 --> 04:27.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:27.022 --> 04:29.389
Did not see that coming.
You got a driver's license?

04:29.391 --> 04:30.656
I'm working on it.

04:30.658 --> 04:31.924
Where'd you steal
the Beamer from?

04:31.926 --> 04:33.026
It's not stolen.

04:33.028 --> 04:34.027
Officer Janko, do me a favor.

04:34.029 --> 04:35.028
Call in these plates?

04:35.030 --> 04:36.496
Central, 12-David...

04:36.498 --> 04:38.364
It's not stolen.
I swear, it's my brother's.

04:38.366 --> 04:40.066
- Yeah, right.
- He let me borrow it.

04:40.068 --> 04:41.701
All right, hands
behind your back.

04:41.703 --> 04:44.504
- Let's go. How old are you anyway?
- 15.

04:44.506 --> 04:46.272
15? Well, that's way too much
car for a 15-year-old,

04:46.274 --> 04:47.673
but I guess
you know that now, huh?

04:47.675 --> 04:49.542
- Wha-What's your name?
- Luis Escobar.

04:49.544 --> 04:51.044
What's your brother's name?

04:51.046 --> 04:52.211
- Manuel.
- Plates came back

04:52.213 --> 04:54.547
17 registered
to a Manuel Escobar.

04:54.549 --> 04:55.715
He's telling
the truth?

04:55.717 --> 04:57.717
First time for everything.

04:57.719 --> 04:58.584
So I can go?

04:58.586 --> 05:00.086
Yes, you can go...

05:00.088 --> 05:02.889
back to the precinct soon
as the tow truck gets here.

05:02.891 --> 05:03.890
What for!?

05:03.892 --> 05:05.191
- Hey.
- Driving without a license,

05:05.193 --> 05:07.560
criminal mischief,
just for appetizers.

05:07.562 --> 05:09.028
Let's go.

05:09.030 --> 05:10.997
These cuffs hurt!

05:10.999 --> 05:12.932
Yeah, well, they're new.

05:12.934 --> 05:14.967
They'll break in.

05:14.969 --> 05:17.470
All right,
everybody step back.

05:17.472 --> 05:20.339
Any weekend plans?

05:20.341 --> 05:23.476
Uh, happily, yes.

05:23.478 --> 05:25.511
Oh, that sounds intriguing.

05:25.513 --> 05:27.480
Promise not to tell anybody?

05:27.482 --> 05:29.115
Okay.

05:29.117 --> 05:30.850
Promise not to laugh?

05:30.852 --> 05:32.819
Yeah. That, too.

05:32.821 --> 05:35.188
I'm going
to Mohonk Mountain House.

05:35.190 --> 05:37.723
- Okay.
- With my ex-husband.

05:37.725 --> 05:40.493
Oh.

05:40.495 --> 05:43.329
So, did he ask you,
or you ask him?

05:43.331 --> 05:44.964
We kind of negotiated it.

05:44.966 --> 05:46.532
One room?

05:46.534 --> 05:48.267
Yes.

05:48.269 --> 05:49.836
Okay.

05:49.838 --> 05:51.304
Do you think I'm crazy?

05:51.306 --> 05:53.573
No, actually.

05:53.575 --> 05:55.308
You promise not to tell?

05:55.310 --> 05:56.542
- Sure.
- And not to laugh?

05:58.012 --> 06:02.482
Oh, my Go... Oh.

06:08.155 --> 06:10.690
Somebody call 911!

06:10.692 --> 06:12.058
Monica.

06:12.060 --> 06:14.494
Someone help me!

06:41.237 --> 06:43.138
I'm gonna kill you, Luis!

06:43.140 --> 06:44.940
You arrest him for driving
his own brother's own car?

06:48.045 --> 06:49.445
He's not a criminal!
He's a baby!

06:49.447 --> 06:51.447
Everyone just calm down!

06:51.449 --> 06:52.848
All right?

06:52.850 --> 06:54.550
We brought you down here
to release Luis into

06:54.552 --> 06:56.385
your custody as a
juvenile delinquent.

06:56.387 --> 06:57.953
- Don't call him that.
- He'll have to appear

06:57.955 --> 06:59.755
in family court in
the next couple days.

06:59.757 --> 07:00.823
What court?

07:00.825 --> 07:02.024
Family court.

07:02.026 --> 07:03.659
Can they put him in prison
in family court?

07:03.661 --> 07:05.828
He's not going to prison,
but there are some charges.

07:05.830 --> 07:06.962
He is not going into the system.

07:06.964 --> 07:09.198
You cannot do this
to us again. You can't!

07:09.200 --> 07:11.166
- What do you mean "again"?
- You have taken enough from my family!

07:11.168 --> 07:13.836
Mama, it's okay. It's okay.
Let me. I spent nine years

07:13.838 --> 07:16.605
in prison for a crime
I didn't commit.

07:18.041 --> 07:20.275
You were one
of the Prospect Park Six?

07:20.277 --> 07:22.578
Yeah.

07:23.480 --> 07:24.913
I'm sorry.

07:24.915 --> 07:26.915
Just let us take my brother
out of here, please?

07:28.151 --> 07:30.052
Please?

07:30.054 --> 07:31.553
There's just some paperwork
you got to sign.

07:31.555 --> 07:33.689
- We're gonna need a lawyer.
- It's just the release

07:33.691 --> 07:35.057
for your brother
and the family court

07:35.059 --> 07:36.959
appearance ticket. You don't
need a lawyer for this part,

07:36.961 --> 07:38.127
I promise.

07:38.129 --> 07:39.595
One thing
I learned the hard way?

07:39.597 --> 07:42.164
You're in a police station,
you sure as hell need a lawyer.

07:42.166 --> 07:44.233
And cops' promises
don't mean nothin'.

07:49.472 --> 07:52.641
Let's have a seat.

07:58.215 --> 07:59.915
I got a favor to ask you.

07:59.917 --> 08:02.251
I'd ask my sister,
but she's in no shape.

08:02.253 --> 08:03.253
Shoot.

08:03.402 --> 08:05.658
Kid borrowed his brother's
Beamer, cracked it up.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.392
- Anybody hurt?
- No, just the Beamer.

08:07.394 --> 08:08.660
Charges?

08:08.662 --> 08:10.382
Enough to get him sent
to juvenile detention,

08:10.383 --> 08:12.082
he draws the wrong judge.

08:12.084 --> 08:14.084
- He a friend of yours?
- No, but

08:14.086 --> 08:16.053
brother who owns the car,
Manuel Escobar--

08:16.399 --> 08:17.832
one of the Prospect Park Six.

08:17.834 --> 08:19.233
That family's got
a break coming.

08:19.235 --> 08:22.370
Five million bucks--
I'd call that a break.

08:22.372 --> 08:25.706
I mean, a break from the cops
and the justice system.

08:25.708 --> 08:27.108
I think they're owed it.

08:27.110 --> 08:28.743
I'll tell you what.

08:28.745 --> 08:31.512
I'll talk to some people at
the city law department, okay?

08:31.514 --> 08:33.347
Thanks, Anthony.

08:34.515 --> 08:38.352
Erin, can you just set aside
who it is for one moment?

08:38.354 --> 08:40.453
I can't.

08:41.722 --> 08:42.957
You have to, Erin.

08:42.958 --> 08:44.425
But I can't.

08:44.427 --> 08:46.060
Look, a gun
goes off,

08:46.062 --> 08:48.429
and what happens?
Instinct takes over.

08:48.431 --> 08:50.231
Your brain automatically
tells your eyes

08:50.233 --> 08:52.233
to look where the shot came...
- But I didn't.

08:52.235 --> 08:53.801
I looked right at the horror.

08:53.803 --> 08:57.438
I've never seen someone
executed in front of me, Danny.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.740
- Okay, but...
- Just, just stop!

08:59.742 --> 09:01.976
Uncle Danny?

09:01.978 --> 09:03.811
Maybe in the morning.

09:03.813 --> 09:05.946
Okay, I'm sorry, all right?

09:05.948 --> 09:07.915
It's my job.
I can't help it.

09:07.917 --> 09:10.885
Maybe do your other job, Danny?

09:14.990 --> 09:17.024
Hey, I'm sorry.

09:22.244 --> 09:25.650
The victim was a
16-year-old female

09:25.651 --> 09:28.585
walking the three blocks from
band practice at her school

09:28.587 --> 09:31.522
to her building on the
300 block of East 108.

09:31.524 --> 09:34.057
Nine millimeter shell casing
was recovered at the scene.

09:34.059 --> 09:36.427
- 16?
- Yeah.

09:36.429 --> 09:38.562
CSU recover anything else?

09:38.564 --> 09:40.998
The city hall, Forest Hills,
Stuy Town murders--

09:41.000 --> 09:43.233
we didn't recover casings
from those scenes,

09:43.235 --> 09:44.601
and they're running
this latest one now.

09:44.603 --> 09:46.336
Witnesses?

09:46.338 --> 09:49.640
An Uber driver on the block and
a super in an adjacent building.

09:49.642 --> 09:52.176
Both confirm a dark sedan
with out-of-state plates.

09:52.178 --> 09:54.311
There are 49 other states.
Did they say?

09:54.313 --> 09:56.847
One thought Jersey,
the other thought Pennsylvania.

09:56.849 --> 10:00.317
They're not murders.
They're assassinations.

10:00.319 --> 10:01.518
Tomato, tomahto.

10:01.520 --> 10:04.922
No, big difference
in connecting pattern to motive.

10:04.924 --> 10:06.290
What's your gut say, boss?

10:06.292 --> 10:08.058
Well, that's just it.

10:08.060 --> 10:10.694
It doesn't make any sense,
what my gut is saying,

10:10.696 --> 10:13.831
but it's a loud, clear voice
I've heard all my life.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.098
And what is it saying?

10:15.100 --> 10:16.800
Just for this room?

10:16.802 --> 10:19.169
- Copy. - Copy.
- Of course.

10:19.171 --> 10:24.308
That the assassinations are tied
to the Prospect Park Six.

10:24.310 --> 10:27.211
Their release, their reward.

10:28.680 --> 10:30.414
Their innocence?

10:30.416 --> 10:32.783
Ah, I can't reconcile it,
but it won't shut up.

10:32.785 --> 10:34.785
And you can't pursue it, either.

10:34.787 --> 10:36.753
There'd be torches and
pitchforks at the gates,

10:36.755 --> 10:38.589
and rightfully so.

10:38.591 --> 10:40.157
But it makes sense.

10:40.159 --> 10:41.358
It does?

10:41.360 --> 10:43.760
Yes, in the sense
that, look,

10:43.762 --> 10:45.229
you're carrying guilt around

10:45.231 --> 10:48.165
about the nine years
that those kids lost.

10:48.167 --> 10:49.433
Well, regrets.

10:49.435 --> 10:50.901
Okay, and
what you call

10:50.903 --> 10:52.269
"regret" would have any of us

10:52.271 --> 10:53.837
unable to get up off the floor.

10:53.839 --> 10:56.940
It makes sense that you would
want a box to put that in,

10:56.942 --> 10:58.675
a way to salvage something

10:58.677 --> 11:00.944
for our side out
of this debacle.

11:03.715 --> 11:06.750
That's probably all this is.

11:13.926 --> 11:16.360
Mr. Dooley, we're very sorry
for what happened to your mom.

11:16.362 --> 11:18.662
But if her killer's
still out on the street,

11:18.664 --> 11:20.464
then we'd like
to catch the guy.

11:20.466 --> 11:23.000
Yeah, I understand.

11:23.002 --> 11:25.202
Have there been any threats
to your mom lately?

11:25.204 --> 11:27.337
Look, I get it-- but no.

11:27.339 --> 11:29.339
Okay? She was a classic
little old lady.

11:29.341 --> 11:30.908
She wouldn't hurt a fly, okay?

11:30.910 --> 11:32.476
Uh-huh.
And how about you?

11:32.478 --> 11:35.512
What, threats?
Yeah, pretty much every day.

11:35.514 --> 11:37.981
Corrections captain
at Yorkville Prison.

11:37.983 --> 11:39.683
Okay. So anything pop
into your head

11:39.685 --> 11:41.084
when you heard the bad news?

11:41.086 --> 11:43.453
That I'd love to catch
this scumbag myself.

11:43.455 --> 11:46.356
Yeah, like, any <i>particular</i>
scumbag you had in mind?

11:46.358 --> 11:48.525
There was one skel,

11:48.527 --> 11:49.793
Randall Meems.

11:49.795 --> 11:51.461
He's a vicious little twerp.

11:51.463 --> 11:53.530
Got his charges dropped,
and he walked

11:53.532 --> 11:54.698
the week before last.

11:54.700 --> 11:57.200
He said something to me
along the lines of, uh,

11:57.202 --> 11:59.236
"I owe you big time."

11:59.238 --> 12:00.170
And not like,

12:00.172 --> 12:01.838
"I owe you a solid"?

12:01.840 --> 12:03.106
- No.
- Okay.

12:03.108 --> 12:04.942
- Because?
- I had him on my block

12:04.944 --> 12:07.177
for almost a year
while he was awaiting trial.

12:07.179 --> 12:09.546
He needed a lot of corrections.

12:09.548 --> 12:11.048
A lot.

12:11.050 --> 12:13.784
And you... supervised that
personally, did you?

12:13.786 --> 12:15.018
Like I said,

12:15.020 --> 12:16.253
I'm a captain.

12:16.255 --> 12:18.822
Yeah. I bet you run
a very tight ship.

12:18.824 --> 12:20.457
You cops deal with
these scumbags

12:20.459 --> 12:22.092
for what,
maybe a couple of hours?

12:22.094 --> 12:25.562
We get them for months,
even years.

12:29.468 --> 12:32.603
Yeah, that's
exactly right.

12:32.605 --> 12:35.539
I know where Randall Meems is,
and I'm not telling you.

12:35.541 --> 12:36.569
We clear on that?

12:36.593 --> 12:38.209
Oh, we got you
violating your parole

12:38.210 --> 12:40.277
ten ways till Tuesday,
and won't hesitate

12:40.279 --> 12:42.045
to notify your PO.

12:42.047 --> 12:44.281
We clear on <i>that?</i>

12:46.050 --> 12:47.985
Do you love Randall, Brandi?

12:47.987 --> 12:51.555
What the hell
kind of question is that?

12:51.557 --> 12:53.557
Pretty simple one.

12:55.426 --> 12:58.962
What does love have
to do with anything?

13:00.031 --> 13:01.131
I'm getting a coffee.

13:01.133 --> 13:03.600
- Anyone?
- I'm good.

13:03.602 --> 13:05.369
Yeah. Black. Two sugars.

13:06.605 --> 13:08.071
You do realize

13:08.073 --> 13:11.141
we simply want to ask Randall
a few questions is all.

13:11.143 --> 13:13.243
- Good luck with that.
- Do you really want

13:13.245 --> 13:15.479
to go back to the
joint for violating

13:15.481 --> 13:17.447
just so's Randall
doesn't have to answer

13:17.449 --> 13:18.849
a few simple
questions?

13:19.917 --> 13:22.152
He lost a year of his life

13:22.154 --> 13:24.421
at Yorkville waiting for trial.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.090
Did you know that?

13:27.092 --> 13:29.192
- I heard something.
- Yeah, it all started

13:29.194 --> 13:32.596
when some NYPD dick
started asking questions.

13:32.598 --> 13:35.132
He didn't like
Randall's answers.

13:36.701 --> 13:37.834
Do you know that?

13:37.836 --> 13:39.369
I know the charges were dropped.

13:39.371 --> 13:40.771
Yeah, 'cause they
didn't have a case.

13:40.773 --> 13:43.440
Took 'em a year
to figure that out.

13:43.442 --> 13:46.810
One last time.
Where is he?

13:46.812 --> 13:49.846
One last time, I ain't saying.

13:51.449 --> 13:53.684
I called in
to the ME's office.

13:53.686 --> 13:55.385
Randall Meems died
of an overdose

13:55.387 --> 13:56.920
nine days ago.

13:56.922 --> 13:58.855
So where he is,
is six feet under.

13:58.857 --> 14:01.925
Not our guy. A uniform is
on his way to escort you out.

14:01.927 --> 14:03.193
You're free to go.

14:17.626 --> 14:18.726
Okay, a million
for the apartment,

14:18.728 --> 14:20.161
a hundred fifty grand
for the turbo.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.774
Turbo S Cabriolet,
all the trimmings,

14:22.775 --> 14:26.310
special order green paint--
so more like 230.

14:26.312 --> 14:29.480
Okay, so you're
at 1.2 out of five.

14:29.482 --> 14:33.250
A million for savings,
a million for charity.

14:33.252 --> 14:35.786
- What charity?
- <i>Charities.</i>

14:35.788 --> 14:37.922
Cancer research,
food bank,

14:37.924 --> 14:40.591
those beagles they do
makeup experiments on--

14:40.593 --> 14:41.792
I'm saving all of them.

14:41.794 --> 14:44.261
All right, that still
only puts you at 3.2.

14:44.263 --> 14:45.463
You got to spend five.

14:45.465 --> 14:46.931
I'll get you
a new leather jacket.

14:46.933 --> 14:48.532
That one you got
is starting to smell

14:48.534 --> 14:51.602
like whatever animal it came off of.
- It does not.

14:51.604 --> 14:53.204
Trust me.

14:53.206 --> 14:56.173
Okay, say $500 for the jacket--
you're still way short.

14:56.851 --> 14:58.751
1C.

15:01.055 --> 15:02.255
Who's there?

15:02.257 --> 15:04.724
Officers Reagan and Janko.

15:08.395 --> 15:10.163
Hi, Mrs. Escobar.

15:10.165 --> 15:11.219
Why are there cops at my door?

15:11.220 --> 15:13.186
It's a public service,
Mrs. Escobar.

15:13.188 --> 15:14.688
My partner and I were
in the neighborhood,

15:14.690 --> 15:16.323
and we just wanted
to make sure that

15:16.325 --> 15:18.759
Luis is ready for his
family court appointment.

15:18.761 --> 15:20.494
And what business
is that of yours?

15:21.329 --> 15:23.430
- It was his idea.
- And I don't want

15:23.432 --> 15:25.165
to hear from you,
either, Blondie.

15:26.034 --> 15:27.668
Fine.

15:27.670 --> 15:29.703
3:30, be there
or be square.

15:29.705 --> 15:31.071
Ma, where's my tie?

15:31.939 --> 15:34.107
The hook in your
brother's closet.

15:37.612 --> 15:38.845
What are you really doing here?

15:38.847 --> 15:40.480
What he said.

15:40.482 --> 15:43.917
Oh. Making sure Luis makes
his court date.

15:43.919 --> 15:45.018
Yes, ma'am.

15:45.020 --> 15:47.587
You must think I'm stupid.

15:47.589 --> 15:49.289
So unless you have

15:49.291 --> 15:50.891
a warrant...

15:50.893 --> 15:53.226
stay away from my door.

15:59.867 --> 16:01.968
Why are you eating standing up?

16:01.970 --> 16:05.939
New diet: you eat one
meal a day standing up,

16:05.941 --> 16:07.741
calories don't get
to settle in,

16:07.743 --> 16:10.377
voilà, you lose
three pounds a week.

16:10.379 --> 16:12.112
Is there any science
behind that?

16:12.114 --> 16:13.347
I didn't ask.

16:13.349 --> 16:14.481
You know, this is

16:14.483 --> 16:15.716
too wide a field
we're searching.

16:15.718 --> 16:18.018
- Yeah.
- Monica put away mobsters,

16:18.020 --> 16:20.387
drug lords, guns for hire.

16:20.389 --> 16:23.690
I mean, the whole Santa's list
of dangerous enemies to have.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.392
Right.

16:25.394 --> 16:28.228
So what haystack
is the needle in?

16:28.230 --> 16:30.397
If I were to pick,

16:30.399 --> 16:33.600
I'd start with the security
logs from this building,

16:34.359 --> 16:38.128
uh, the video from 100 and 111
Centre Street courthouses,

16:38.130 --> 16:39.762
say, going back a month,

16:39.764 --> 16:43.933
and see if there's something
we could call a dry run.

16:43.935 --> 16:45.802
Okay.

16:49.473 --> 16:51.241
Five bucks says he's gone.

16:51.243 --> 16:52.842
Deal.

16:58.315 --> 16:59.415
Still?

16:59.417 --> 17:01.518
Yeah.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.420
Let's.

17:10.493 --> 17:12.829
Come in.

17:13.763 --> 17:15.231
My time's not my own, so...

17:15.233 --> 17:16.566
We just got to talkin'...

17:16.568 --> 17:19.602
About the fact that you're
holed up with the case files.

17:19.604 --> 17:21.304
- My dime, my time.
- Well, we were talking

17:21.306 --> 17:23.205
about maybe you'd like
to share your thinking

17:23.208 --> 17:24.307
with the three of us.

17:24.309 --> 17:26.409
Two of us have held
the rank of detective.

17:26.411 --> 17:28.044
And Garrett could take notes.

17:28.046 --> 17:29.078
Nothing for me

17:29.080 --> 17:31.114
to share yet.
- Nothing?

17:31.116 --> 17:33.283
Nothing that ties the murders
to each other,

17:33.285 --> 17:35.251
much less to my gut.

17:35.253 --> 17:37.320
Well, maybe that should
tell you something.

17:37.322 --> 17:39.088
- Like what?
- Well, like...

17:39.090 --> 17:42.025
maybe your hunch is based
on playing defense, not offense.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.394
Go on.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.595
Boss, it's natural

17:45.597 --> 17:47.931
for a cop, he finds out
his collar was innocent

17:47.933 --> 17:49.265
of what he collared him for,

17:49.267 --> 17:51.467
he goes: Well, maybe
he didn't do this one,

17:51.469 --> 17:53.536
but he's sure as hell
guilty of something.

17:53.538 --> 17:54.504
We've all been there.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.372
Cops, that is.
I get it.

17:56.374 --> 17:57.974
- This isn't that.
- You just said yourself

17:57.976 --> 18:00.143
there's no evidence
backing this hunch up.

18:00.145 --> 18:01.945
Actually, I said "yet."

18:01.947 --> 18:03.513
Okay, but...
- And this is not

18:03.515 --> 18:05.715
the <i>Caine,</i>
and I am not Captain Queeg,

18:05.717 --> 18:08.017
so please do not tiptoe
around me.

18:08.019 --> 18:09.953
- We're not. We're just concerned...
- Maybe in a week,

18:09.955 --> 18:12.422
if I am rattling ball bearings

18:12.424 --> 18:13.723
and mumbling about strawberries,

18:13.725 --> 18:15.191
then be concerned.

18:15.193 --> 18:17.794
Right now, leave me be.

18:17.796 --> 18:19.796
Yes, sir.

18:19.798 --> 18:21.130
And know this--

18:21.132 --> 18:24.300
the last thing I want is
for any of these young men

18:24.302 --> 18:27.036
to be put through
another ringer.

18:27.038 --> 18:29.305
The last thing.

18:39.350 --> 18:41.551
- Pop?
- In here, Francis.

18:48.592 --> 18:49.892
Well, well, well.

18:49.894 --> 18:51.194
My idea.

18:51.196 --> 18:52.929
How you doing?

18:52.931 --> 18:55.665
About how you'd think.

18:56.834 --> 18:59.035
How much do you know?

18:59.037 --> 19:00.203
Just what Gramps told us.

19:00.205 --> 19:02.939
That you... are
wrestling with a hunch.

19:02.941 --> 19:04.607
Based on nothing.

19:04.609 --> 19:06.609
Not... nothing.

19:06.611 --> 19:08.678
- No.
- Hmm.

19:09.813 --> 19:11.648
Come on, it's just us,
Dad-- out with it.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.883
Well, one of the Six,

19:13.885 --> 19:15.885
Duwann... Wilson,

19:15.887 --> 19:19.322
lost his mom to cancer
while he was in prison.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.057
But he insisted

19:21.059 --> 19:23.459
that she died
of a broken heart.

19:23.461 --> 19:24.827
And then...

19:24.829 --> 19:28.131
the warden wouldn't let him go
to her funeral.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.667
Okay, well, that's
harsh stuff,

19:30.669 --> 19:32.368
but... it doesn't exactly add up

19:32.370 --> 19:34.470
to this guy going
on a killing spree.

19:34.472 --> 19:37.006
And five million heals
a lot of hurt feelings.

19:37.008 --> 19:38.675
Yeah, but after that
he starting acting up,

19:38.677 --> 19:41.010
getting violent,
promising payback

19:41.012 --> 19:44.914
to everyone who had a hand
in putting him away.

19:44.916 --> 19:47.083
Well, I'd go ballistic, too,
if I were him.

19:47.085 --> 19:49.485
Yeah, but stay with me,
'cause this...

19:49.487 --> 19:52.488
is the leap.

19:52.490 --> 19:54.023
What if...

19:54.025 --> 19:58.094
you had eight more years
for this to fester?

19:58.096 --> 20:00.797
What if you got
it in your head

20:00.799 --> 20:02.231
to seek revenge in kind?

20:02.233 --> 20:05.168
Might you, instead...

20:05.170 --> 20:08.137
go after someone
nearest and dearest

20:08.139 --> 20:10.139
to the person who wronged you,

20:10.141 --> 20:13.676
so that <i>they</i> would be left
to suffer that loss

20:13.678 --> 20:16.512
for the rest of their days?

20:16.514 --> 20:19.549
To suffer a fate <i>worse</i>
than death.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.184
Like that, yeah.

20:21.186 --> 20:22.318
That's a lot of what-ifs.

20:22.320 --> 20:25.254
And nothing to tie him
to the murders, I know,

20:25.256 --> 20:28.624
and maybe just the mind games
of a rusty old detective

20:28.626 --> 20:31.728
with a guilty conscience.
I know that, too.

20:33.097 --> 20:36.566
And if you're in the ballpark...

20:36.568 --> 20:39.936
one of us would be
on that list, too.

20:39.938 --> 20:41.571
If I'm in the ballpark.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.106
Maybe the
bullet for Monica

20:43.108 --> 20:44.507
was meant for me.

20:44.509 --> 20:46.342
Pretty easy
to tell you two apart, though.

20:48.713 --> 20:50.380
Especially at close... range.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.883
We got an officer shot.

20:53.885 --> 20:55.218
Line of duty?

20:55.220 --> 20:58.654
No, off.
Apparently, walking her dog.

21:15.474 --> 21:17.874
They were in Yorkville
for 11 months awaiting trial.

21:18.119 --> 21:20.709
I've wrangled thousands of scumbags
in my 15 years.

21:20.710 --> 21:22.510
Do you think I remember
every one of them?

21:22.512 --> 21:24.512
Well, you remembered
Randall Meems pretty good.

21:24.514 --> 21:25.526
It was a pretty
famous case.

21:25.527 --> 21:28.061
A young schoolteacher was
gang-raped and left for dead.

21:28.063 --> 21:29.763
- Okay. So?
- So did you have

21:29.765 --> 21:31.465
any of them on your cell block?

21:31.467 --> 21:33.777
Again, that was ten years
and thousands of...

21:33.801 --> 21:34.302
Come on, it was

21:34.303 --> 21:37.104
all over the news for months--
you had one, you bragged on it.

21:37.106 --> 21:39.406
All right, s-so what if I did?

21:39.408 --> 21:43.176
So if you did, were there
a lot of "corrections" involved?

21:43.178 --> 21:46.179
Meaning, did you get
medieval on any of them?

21:46.181 --> 21:47.614
What, are you trying
to get me jammed up?

21:47.616 --> 21:49.182
No, I'm not trying
to get you jammed up.

21:49.184 --> 21:50.517
I'm trying to
find the killer--

21:50.519 --> 21:52.319
your ma's killer,
and four other people.

21:52.321 --> 21:53.954
One scumbag did 'em all?

21:53.956 --> 21:55.355
That's what we're
trying to figure out.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.990
And if you keep
holding out on us,

21:56.992 --> 21:58.292
you're gonna find out

21:58.294 --> 21:59.559
what "jammed up" really means.

21:59.561 --> 22:01.495
Now, did you know 'em or not?

22:01.497 --> 22:03.163
All right. Yeah, one.

22:03.165 --> 22:05.465
Which one?

22:05.467 --> 22:07.968
The one whose name sounds like,
uh, the NBA player.

22:07.970 --> 22:10.470
Duwann Wilson?

22:10.472 --> 22:11.939
That one, yeah.

22:11.941 --> 22:13.807
Tall. Real scumbag.

22:14.642 --> 22:17.210
You think he'd remember you?

22:18.479 --> 22:20.647
And how awful you treated him?

22:31.193 --> 22:34.227
Samson, thank you
for coming down.

22:35.596 --> 22:36.964
We're so sorry for your loss.

22:36.966 --> 22:38.465
Thank you.

22:38.467 --> 22:40.334
It was our loss, too.

22:40.336 --> 22:42.602
I just want you to know
she admired you. Both of you.

22:42.604 --> 22:44.071
Please.

22:44.073 --> 22:46.840
Any other day, it would
be just as devastating,

22:46.842 --> 22:48.942
but we were about
to start over.

22:48.944 --> 22:50.877
Start a new chapter in life.

22:50.879 --> 22:53.747
I know.
We talked about it just...

22:53.749 --> 22:56.283
just that day, actually.

22:56.285 --> 22:59.419
Yeah. So cruel.

23:00.254 --> 23:02.289
Well, let's, uh,

23:02.291 --> 23:03.757
let's get down to business.

23:03.759 --> 23:05.359
What can I help you with?

23:05.361 --> 23:08.862
Well, I-I know
this is a long shot, but...

23:08.864 --> 23:11.598
did you have any involvement
in the prosecution

23:11.600 --> 23:14.101
of the so-called
Prospect Park Six?

23:14.103 --> 23:15.302
Involvement?

23:15.304 --> 23:17.204
Erin, I-I led the prosecution.

23:18.272 --> 23:20.440
What did we miss?

23:20.442 --> 23:21.942
There's nothing
in the trial records about you.

23:21.944 --> 23:23.910
Well, that's because two days
before trial was set to begin,

23:23.912 --> 23:25.645
I was ordered to undergo

23:25.647 --> 23:26.813
a triple bypass.

23:26.815 --> 23:28.415
There was no thought
of adjourning,

23:28.417 --> 23:29.616
so my second seat took over.

23:29.618 --> 23:31.018
And they just erased you
from the records?

23:31.020 --> 23:33.653
Glory hogging doesn't happen
in this building?

23:33.655 --> 23:35.655
What does this have to do with?

23:35.657 --> 23:37.124
Who did you offer to plead down

23:37.126 --> 23:39.026
if they flipped
on one of the others?

23:39.028 --> 23:40.727
Five of the six.

23:40.729 --> 23:41.862
Against who?

23:41.864 --> 23:43.964
Hmm, a made-up name.

23:43.966 --> 23:46.366
Dontrell or Dashonte...

23:46.368 --> 23:47.834
Duwann Wilson?

23:47.836 --> 23:49.703
That's it.

23:49.705 --> 23:51.238
And what did you see
that you thought

23:51.240 --> 23:53.240
the others might flip on him?

23:53.242 --> 23:54.941
Alpha dog. Intimidating.

23:54.943 --> 23:56.209
You know how they stick out.

23:56.211 --> 23:59.146
The kind a cop says,
"He's guilty of something."

23:59.148 --> 24:00.614
And did they flip?

24:00.616 --> 24:03.050
No. 'Cause they were
all innocent, as it turns out.

24:03.052 --> 24:05.852
So, again,
what's this all about?

24:17.065 --> 24:19.066
Officers Reagan and Janko.

24:19.934 --> 24:21.935
What this time?

24:21.937 --> 24:24.404
Just want to check up
on your family court outcome.

24:25.273 --> 24:27.207
They agreed to adjust his case.

24:27.209 --> 24:29.242
Luis just has to stay out
of trouble.

24:29.244 --> 24:31.511
We thought maybe you'd
want to thank us.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.713
We're a long way from even.

24:35.216 --> 24:36.316
Moving out.

24:36.318 --> 24:38.785
Manuel bought a house
in Yonkers.

24:38.787 --> 24:40.287
Nine rooms.

24:40.289 --> 24:42.722
Well, good luck to you.

24:44.292 --> 24:45.792
Uh, Manuel.

24:45.794 --> 24:46.827
Say "he""

24:46.829 --> 24:47.961
to Duwann for me,
you talk to him.

24:47.963 --> 24:49.763
- He don't talk to Duwann.
- You know Duwann?

24:49.765 --> 24:51.398
Yeah, I used to coach him
in police league hoops.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.266
Yeah. Yeah, he could play.

24:53.268 --> 24:54.568
Yeah, he sure could.

24:54.570 --> 24:56.736
- He don't talk to Duwann.
- Okay, well,

24:56.738 --> 24:58.972
got a number for him?
I'd like to keep in touch.

24:58.974 --> 25:01.136
Look, he don't have nothing
'cause they ain't in touch.

25:01.137 --> 25:01.718
All right, well,

25:01.719 --> 25:03.786
I'd like Manuel to have
my digits, just the same.

25:11.228 --> 25:13.729
I hear from him,
I'll pass it on.

25:14.598 --> 25:16.299
Now, if you'll excuse us,

25:16.301 --> 25:18.134
we have a house to pack up.

25:20.003 --> 25:22.038
Who's Duwann?

25:22.040 --> 25:24.206
One of the Prospect Park Six.

25:24.208 --> 25:25.608
You coached him in hoops?

25:25.610 --> 25:26.709
Never told me that.

25:26.711 --> 25:28.010
That's because I
never coached him.

25:28.012 --> 25:29.578
But he was six foot
by seventh grade,

25:29.580 --> 25:30.713
and from this neighborhood,

25:30.715 --> 25:32.248
he definitely would
have played hoops.

25:32.250 --> 25:34.450
You want to tell me
what this is about?

25:34.452 --> 25:36.352
Yeah, on the ride.

25:36.354 --> 25:37.887
<i>We got surveillance video</i>

25:37.889 --> 25:39.255
near four of the five scenes

25:39.257 --> 25:42.258
has a black or gray
'05 Nissan Sentra

25:42.260 --> 25:43.526
with Jersey plates.

25:43.528 --> 25:45.695
Two of the plates we could ID,
both stolen

25:45.697 --> 25:48.331
from cars in the long-term
lots out at Newark Airport.

25:48.333 --> 25:49.665
Old Nissans
around here

25:49.667 --> 25:52.468
is like pickup trucks in Texas.
They're everywhere.

25:52.470 --> 25:54.704
Pieces of the
puzzle, not the completed.

25:54.706 --> 25:57.139
Last night's fatality,

25:57.141 --> 25:58.307
Officer Nunez?

25:58.309 --> 26:00.976
Her father
was the lead detective

26:00.978 --> 26:02.578
in the Prospect Park rape case.

26:02.580 --> 26:04.280
Since retired to Florida.

26:04.282 --> 26:07.950
So we got ties
to three out of five hits.

26:07.952 --> 26:10.086
Four. That 16-year-old victim
in Harlem?

26:10.088 --> 26:12.688
Her stepmother was one of the
arresting officers the night of.

26:12.690 --> 26:14.623
Also since retired.

26:15.359 --> 26:17.626
- Boss.
- What?

26:17.628 --> 26:18.728
If your theory's correct,

26:18.730 --> 26:20.596
wouldn't a Reagan
be on the list?

26:21.431 --> 26:23.132
Well, it came up,

26:23.134 --> 26:25.301
but was kind of discarded.

26:25.303 --> 26:28.337
And, you know, right now
those aren't tied to the hits.

26:28.339 --> 26:29.372
They're just coincidences.

26:29.374 --> 26:31.407
Boss, I'd call it
more than that.

26:31.409 --> 26:33.909
All right? I think we
should scoop up Duwann.

26:33.911 --> 26:37.279
Okay, Sid. Say we scoop up
Duwann or any of them.

26:37.281 --> 26:39.482
No weapon,
no witness placing 'em.

26:39.484 --> 26:41.016
Just the hunch of one cop.

26:41.018 --> 26:43.386
Well, you put it that way...
Yeah.

26:43.388 --> 26:44.620
So, they call their lawyers.

26:44.622 --> 26:45.888
The lawyers calls the press,

26:45.890 --> 26:47.056
and the press writes

26:47.058 --> 26:49.458
that we're still persecuting
these young men.

26:49.460 --> 26:52.328
And you're the worst person
in the world.

26:54.097 --> 26:56.132
And if it turns out
I'm wrong about this,

26:56.134 --> 26:58.868
they'd be absolutely right
to say that.

27:04.674 --> 27:06.575
I don't know.

27:09.346 --> 27:10.913
Hey, Reagan.

27:10.915 --> 27:12.681
Guy looking for you out back.

27:12.683 --> 27:13.883
Manuel something.

27:13.885 --> 27:15.718
You know him?

27:15.720 --> 27:17.453
- Yeah.
- Said he doesn't want

27:17.455 --> 27:18.854
to come in.

27:18.856 --> 27:21.056
That's-that's cool.
Thanks, Jack.

27:33.003 --> 27:34.336
What's this?

27:34.338 --> 27:36.439
She made me give up the card.

27:36.441 --> 27:37.840
Because?

27:37.842 --> 27:39.575
She don't want me having nothing
to do with any of the guys.

27:39.577 --> 27:41.444
But you're still in
touch with Duwann?

27:41.446 --> 27:43.145
Yeah.

27:43.147 --> 27:45.247
Yeah, he texts me on and off.

27:45.249 --> 27:46.882
Sometimes some crazy stuff.

27:46.884 --> 27:48.751
- Like what?
- Just stuff.

27:48.753 --> 27:50.753
How five million
would never be enough.

27:50.755 --> 27:52.755
How we just got paid
like we was nothing.

27:52.757 --> 27:54.790
I figure he's back on the weed,

27:54.792 --> 27:57.226
'cause he always talking crazy
every time he gets high.

27:59.129 --> 28:00.996
But you came down here anyway.

28:00.998 --> 28:03.732
I can't have a cop thinking
I'm holding out on him

28:03.734 --> 28:05.534
or a cop in my business
ever again.

28:05.536 --> 28:06.969
I lost ten years for that.

28:06.971 --> 28:09.104
I'm innocent of everything,
and I'm staying that way.

28:09.106 --> 28:11.006
I'm terrified of cops.

28:11.008 --> 28:13.142
I'm not surprised.

28:14.611 --> 28:16.312
You got the number
and the texts?

28:16.314 --> 28:18.047
Yeah.

28:18.049 --> 28:19.748
All right.

28:19.750 --> 28:21.083
I want you to
forward them to me,

28:21.085 --> 28:24.019
and not a word of this
to Duwann or anyone else.

28:24.021 --> 28:26.155
Last thing I'm-a talk about
is talking to a cop.

28:27.224 --> 28:28.424
All right.

28:33.730 --> 28:36.031
<i>What do you got?</i>

28:36.033 --> 28:38.000
Looking at the cell records,
far as I can tell,

28:38.002 --> 28:40.202
that phone hasn't left Miami
since March 9.

28:40.204 --> 28:41.670
- Are you positive?
- Yes.

28:41.672 --> 28:43.172
It's active for over
16 hours a day,

28:43.174 --> 28:44.840
mostly in a 12-block radius

28:44.842 --> 28:45.841
in South Beach.

28:45.843 --> 28:48.577
Okay. Well, maybe he
had a second phone.

28:48.579 --> 28:50.346
And have someone
using this phone

28:50.348 --> 28:52.314
day and night in Miami
to cover his tracks?

28:52.316 --> 28:54.350
- New one on me.
- Good point.

28:54.352 --> 28:56.318
Detective.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.454
A Duwann Wilson

28:58.456 --> 28:59.788
has been in residence

28:59.790 --> 29:02.458
at the South Beach Grand Resort
& Hotel since early March.

29:02.460 --> 29:04.093
His presence
is known to the staff

29:04.095 --> 29:05.928
on a daily basis.

29:08.665 --> 29:10.232
Great.

29:10.234 --> 29:12.368
Flip you for who
tells the old man.

29:12.370 --> 29:14.470
Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.

29:14.472 --> 29:16.372
Hey, wait a minute.

29:19.076 --> 29:20.676
Yeah.

29:20.678 --> 29:22.778
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

29:22.780 --> 29:24.246
We got to be
missing something.

29:24.248 --> 29:25.481
Yeah, but what, Gramps?

29:25.483 --> 29:27.950
Phone records
and a hotel full of witnesses

29:27.952 --> 29:29.385
show that Duwann was in Miami

29:29.387 --> 29:31.120
before the shooting spree
even started.

29:31.122 --> 29:33.556
It is what it is.

29:33.558 --> 29:36.792
You always say you have to walk
in the other man's shoes first.

29:36.794 --> 29:38.027
I did.

29:38.029 --> 29:40.496
Guy gets some serious money
suddenly,

29:40.498 --> 29:42.831
and he does exactly
what I'd expect him to do:

29:42.833 --> 29:45.501
throw some around a nice hotel
in Miami Beach.

29:45.503 --> 29:48.170
My hunch was wrong.

29:49.005 --> 29:51.607
Well, wait.
Just h-hold on a minute.

29:51.609 --> 29:52.808
Why? He's right.

29:52.810 --> 29:54.977
Or we're throwing the baby out
with the bathwater.

29:55.845 --> 29:58.013
There's too many good pieces
in place.

29:58.882 --> 30:00.716
You know, maybe he's right.

30:00.718 --> 30:03.552
I mean, at a hotel,
what are you doing?

30:03.554 --> 30:06.255
You're ordering room service.
You're eating out.

30:06.257 --> 30:08.591
You're getting your clothes
cleaned, put back in your room.

30:08.593 --> 30:10.426
Bed made, etcetera.

30:10.428 --> 30:12.194
But what are you really doing?

30:12.196 --> 30:13.395
Trading up.

30:13.397 --> 30:15.698
Exactly. You're having
somebody else do for you

30:15.700 --> 30:17.866
what you typically
do for yourself,

30:17.868 --> 30:21.270
but now you can afford to have
them do it for you instead.

30:23.540 --> 30:25.507
Okay. A little lost.

30:25.509 --> 30:26.709
Yeah, what are you saying?

30:26.711 --> 30:27.810
I'm saying

30:27.812 --> 30:29.278
that maybe Duwann

30:29.280 --> 30:32.848
didn't have to pull the trigger
physically himself.

30:32.850 --> 30:34.183
One of the other Six?

30:35.051 --> 30:36.885
No.

30:36.887 --> 30:39.755
The hit man he hired.

30:39.757 --> 30:41.123
Bingo.

30:50.776 --> 30:53.864
Dante Sorrento was on the same
cell block as Duwann Wilson

30:53.866 --> 30:56.199
till his release a
month after Wilson.

30:56.201 --> 30:57.367
Got a record as an enforcer

30:57.369 --> 31:00.904
and alleged executioner
going back to his teens.

31:01.806 --> 31:03.807
Do we have him?

31:03.809 --> 31:06.943
It's out on Nlets
to every agency nationwide.

31:06.945 --> 31:09.045
You still got it, boss.

31:09.047 --> 31:11.581
Well, let's not count
our chickens, Sid.

31:11.583 --> 31:14.084
Right now they're just
persons of interest.

31:14.086 --> 31:15.786
Well, have it your way.

31:16.621 --> 31:18.688
But thank you.

31:19.490 --> 31:21.258
You okay?

31:21.260 --> 31:24.194
Oh, I just want this to be over.

31:24.196 --> 31:25.862
Yeah, well, I hear you.

31:25.864 --> 31:29.633
But it's never really over,
is it?

31:29.635 --> 31:33.770
Best you can hope for is a lull
before the next bad thing.

31:34.572 --> 31:37.774
Yeah, well,
keeps us on our toes.

31:40.379 --> 31:42.746
Right now my toes hurt, Sid.

31:45.550 --> 31:47.451
That's a good one, boss.

31:51.789 --> 31:53.957
All right,
six months travel, minimum.

31:53.959 --> 31:56.526
France and Italy
on a vintage Triumph Bonneville.

31:56.528 --> 31:58.295
Don't you mean "in"?

31:58.297 --> 31:59.296
In what?

31:59.298 --> 32:01.798
<i>In</i> a Triumph, not on it.

32:01.800 --> 32:04.501
It's a motorcycle, not a car.

32:04.503 --> 32:06.036
Count me out.

32:06.038 --> 32:07.804
I don't like bikes.

32:07.806 --> 32:09.406
Well, this is my fantasy.

32:09.408 --> 32:10.907
It's not supposed
to be accommodating.

32:12.810 --> 32:15.645
But couldn't it be
a cool old car?

32:15.647 --> 32:17.314
It could in your version.

32:17.316 --> 32:19.649
But this is my five million.

32:19.651 --> 32:20.917
Wow, so selfish
all of a sudden.

32:20.919 --> 32:22.686
<i>Give me a break.</i>

32:22.688 --> 32:24.821
<i>I think I liked you</i>
<i>better before you had money.</i>

32:44.675 --> 32:46.743
Yo, who this?

32:46.745 --> 32:48.144
Duwann Wilson?

32:48.146 --> 32:49.913
Yeah. I said who this?

32:49.915 --> 32:51.581
- It's Danny.
- Danny who?

32:51.583 --> 32:52.716
How'd you get this number?

32:52.718 --> 32:53.984
Detective Danny Reagan

32:53.986 --> 32:55.118
with the NYPD.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.387
Dante Sorrento
gave me your number.

32:59.124 --> 33:00.423
Where are my pants?

33:00.425 --> 33:02.359
Miami-Dade Police!

33:02.361 --> 33:04.528
Turn around.
Put your hands

33:04.530 --> 33:06.463
on the table. Now!

33:06.465 --> 33:08.365
Do what she said!

33:08.367 --> 33:09.466
What the hell this about?

33:09.468 --> 33:10.867
First degree murder,

33:10.869 --> 33:14.304
conspiracy to commit murder in
the five executions you ordered.

33:14.306 --> 33:16.039
I don't know nothing
about no executions.

33:16.041 --> 33:18.675
Well, these officers just
witnessed your reaction

33:18.677 --> 33:20.544
to Sorrento's name,
not to mention

33:20.546 --> 33:22.445
the money transfers
from you

33:22.447 --> 33:24.080
to Sorrento
for services rendered.

33:24.082 --> 33:26.716
This is a warrant
to bring you back to New York,

33:26.718 --> 33:29.119
where it was snowing
last time I checked.

33:29.121 --> 33:32.188
So you
better dress warm.

33:38.996 --> 33:40.997
<i>And last</i>

33:40.999 --> 33:43.500
but not least, funding some
kind of Reagan family foundation

33:43.502 --> 33:45.702
benefiting the families
of fallen officers.

33:45.704 --> 33:47.904
I can't fault that one.

33:47.906 --> 33:49.205
That's a first.

33:49.207 --> 33:51.274
I'm still saving beagles
with mine, though.

33:51.276 --> 33:52.342
To each his own.

33:52.344 --> 33:54.311
<i>Her</i> own.

33:54.313 --> 33:56.513
Right.

34:07.692 --> 34:10.527
Ooh, they make good coffee.

34:10.529 --> 34:11.728
Pull over?

34:20.036 --> 34:22.572
What do you want?
I'm buying.

34:22.574 --> 34:24.574
A three-pound lobster
and a Dom Pérignon.

34:24.576 --> 34:26.042
You're such a jerk.

34:27.344 --> 34:29.212
All right, I'll have a tea.

34:30.081 --> 34:32.514
Thanks.

34:38.522 --> 34:39.889
Excuse me.

34:39.891 --> 34:42.324
All patrol units be advised,

34:42.327 --> 34:45.295
the earlier Finest Message
regarding an '05 Nissan Sentra

34:45.297 --> 34:47.797
with ND New Jersey registration

34:47.799 --> 34:51.967
is now amended to add
a black '05 BMW 7 Series.

34:51.969 --> 34:54.638
Registration not confirmed,
but possibly also bearing

34:54.639 --> 34:56.773
ND Jersey registration.

34:56.775 --> 34:59.909
Operator may be
suspect Dante Sorrento,

34:59.911 --> 35:02.445
DOB 3-9-1964.

35:02.447 --> 35:04.914
Male, white, five-foot-nine,

35:04.916 --> 35:08.551
54 years of age. Please advise
if contact is made with subject.

35:08.553 --> 35:10.720
Approach with extreme caution,
as suspect

35:10.722 --> 35:12.455
is believed to be armed

35:12.457 --> 35:14.591
and responsible
for five homicides.

35:38.849 --> 35:40.650
Move! Jamie!

35:40.652 --> 35:42.152
Police! Move! Out of the way!

35:42.154 --> 35:44.154
Excuse me, Officer.

35:44.156 --> 35:45.388
Jamie!

35:47.726 --> 35:49.092
Jamie!

35:52.831 --> 35:53.863
Stay down!

35:54.465 --> 35:55.298
Stay down! Jamie!

36:05.376 --> 36:06.643
Jamie!

36:06.645 --> 36:07.577
Jamie.

36:07.579 --> 36:08.812
I'm okay.

36:08.814 --> 36:09.946
Go, go.

36:17.455 --> 36:19.489
Jamie...

36:25.696 --> 36:26.863
He's DOA.

36:43.247 --> 36:45.682
That was some shot.

36:47.052 --> 36:49.119
You saved my life.

36:49.121 --> 36:51.321
Jamie,

36:51.323 --> 36:53.356
it was like I heard a voice,

36:53.358 --> 36:54.824
I swear to God.

36:54.826 --> 36:56.593
That's called a radio.

36:56.595 --> 36:58.261
No. Serious.

36:58.263 --> 36:59.896
Like I knew,

36:59.898 --> 37:03.600
I knew you were in trouble
before you even... were.

37:03.602 --> 37:06.002
Like I w-was warned.

37:07.538 --> 37:10.807
Jamie.

37:13.377 --> 37:16.513
I'd spend the five million
on you.

37:43.542 --> 37:46.476
- He's kind of making a habit of this.
- I think

37:46.478 --> 37:48.711
I'm gonna change the statute
of limitations on how long

37:48.713 --> 37:51.047
we have to wait
till Jamie gets home to eat.

37:51.049 --> 37:52.315
No, you're not.

37:52.317 --> 37:54.050
Anybody heard from him?

37:54.052 --> 37:56.052
- No.
- Hey! Sorry!

37:56.054 --> 37:57.453
Hey.
It's on the table!

37:57.455 --> 37:59.222
- Come on!
- Let's go! About time.

37:59.224 --> 38:01.524
Uh, Jack, could you get me
one more place setting?

38:01.526 --> 38:02.859
Yeah, sure.

38:05.296 --> 38:07.630
- What's going on?
- I have no idea.

38:08.999 --> 38:10.733
We having company
or something, kid?

38:10.735 --> 38:12.302
Um...

38:12.304 --> 38:15.004
What's going on?

38:18.409 --> 38:19.642
Oh.

38:19.644 --> 38:20.710
Hi, everyone.

38:20.712 --> 38:22.445
- Hi.
Hello. - Hello.

38:22.447 --> 38:23.646
- Hello.
- Hi.

38:23.648 --> 38:26.015
Officer Janko.

38:26.017 --> 38:27.884
Just Eddie
today, Dad.

38:27.886 --> 38:29.419
Actually,
not...

38:29.421 --> 38:31.487
just Eddie today.

38:32.923 --> 38:34.324
Well, since this morning,

38:34.326 --> 38:36.492
the future Mrs.
Jameson Reagan.

38:36.494 --> 38:38.361
What? Get out!

38:38.363 --> 38:39.329
You're kidding!

38:39.331 --> 38:40.496
Oh, my goodness!

38:40.498 --> 38:42.131
- Congratulations!
- Way to go!

38:42.133 --> 38:43.099
- Whoa!
- Congrats, Uncle Jamie.

38:43.101 --> 38:44.968
Way to go, kid.

38:44.970 --> 38:46.469
- 'Bout time.
- Wow.

38:46.471 --> 38:48.404
Did you know?

38:48.406 --> 38:50.406
I didn't know anything!
- Whoa.

38:53.211 --> 38:55.111
Well, I'll be damned.

38:56.648 --> 38:57.648
Francis.

38:58.515 --> 39:01.150
Congratulations.

39:01.152 --> 39:02.452
- Thank you.
- Mm.

39:02.454 --> 39:04.420
- Wow!
- Right?

39:04.422 --> 39:05.488
Just this morning?

39:05.490 --> 39:07.023
Uh, yeah.

39:07.025 --> 39:08.791
Wow.

39:08.793 --> 39:13.029
Well, at least I know one
wedding present you're getting.

39:13.031 --> 39:16.132
Your choice of precincts
to transfer to.

39:16.134 --> 39:17.533
Oh, gee, Dad.

39:17.535 --> 39:19.669
Every bride's dream.

39:19.671 --> 39:21.571
Hey. I'm just sayin'.

39:21.573 --> 39:22.772
Actually, uh,

39:22.774 --> 39:24.007
we both really like the house

39:24.009 --> 39:24.941
that we're already in.

39:24.943 --> 39:26.542
- Oh?
- But you know

39:26.544 --> 39:28.645
that you can't work together
anymore.

39:28.647 --> 39:29.812
Well, that's what

39:29.814 --> 39:30.980
we thought,
too, Pop.

39:30.982 --> 39:32.015
You thought?

39:32.017 --> 39:33.583
Well, assumed.

39:33.585 --> 39:35.018
But I looked it up.

39:35.020 --> 39:37.654
And there's nothing
in the Patrol Guide--

39:37.656 --> 39:39.656
or any of the books,
for that matter--

39:39.658 --> 39:43.159
says married cops
can't be partners on the job.

39:43.161 --> 39:44.527
Nowhere?

39:46.196 --> 39:47.430
No.

39:47.432 --> 39:48.531
Wow!

39:48.533 --> 39:50.700
But I knew
that you and Dad

39:50.702 --> 39:53.937
would be for that rule, even
if it wasn't actually a rule.

39:53.939 --> 39:58.074
But the rule
does make enormous sense.

39:59.510 --> 40:00.476
Why?

40:00.478 --> 40:03.780
Well,
a couple partnered together

40:03.782 --> 40:06.649
on the job can create conflicts.

40:06.651 --> 40:08.685
Yes, but...

40:08.687 --> 40:09.686
But?

40:09.688 --> 40:10.687
Hear us out?

40:10.689 --> 40:12.488
Consider
if two people

40:12.490 --> 40:14.157
willing to swear
the following to each other

40:14.159 --> 40:16.392
could still be
good partners on the job.

40:16.394 --> 40:18.194
Swear the following what?

40:18.196 --> 40:19.762
Vows

40:19.764 --> 40:20.964
that we wrote...
V...

40:20.966 --> 40:21.965
...to each other.

40:21.967 --> 40:24.534
You wrote... vows already?

40:24.536 --> 40:26.936
Okay.

40:26.938 --> 40:29.639
Turns out she's been working
on 'em for a while,

40:29.641 --> 40:32.542
so I just...
- Turns out so has he.

40:35.513 --> 40:37.380
So...

40:37.382 --> 40:40.950
Uh, I will always
have your back.

40:40.952 --> 40:43.886
If you fall behind,
I'll wait up.

40:43.888 --> 40:45.655
I'll earn your respect

40:45.657 --> 40:49.459
and pay you respect
every day we have.

40:49.461 --> 40:51.394
I'll be your scout,

40:51.396 --> 40:53.429
your night watchman,
your cavalry.

40:53.431 --> 40:55.765
Your medic, your chaplain

40:55.767 --> 40:58.634
in our army of two.

40:58.636 --> 41:00.336
No retreat, no surrender.

41:00.338 --> 41:03.272
- No retreat, no surrender.
- No surrender.

41:04.108 --> 41:06.943
You can count on me.

41:06.945 --> 41:09.579
And you can count on me.

41:32.603 --> 41:36.472
Welcome to our family, Eddie.

41:37.307 --> 41:39.175
Thank you.

41:42.446 --> 41:43.446
Dad.

41:53.658 --> 41:54.891
Okay.

41:54.893 --> 41:56.893
Shall we say grace?

42:08.005 --> 42:10.540
Bless us, O Lord...

42:10.542 --> 42:12.809
...and these,
Thy gifts, which we are

42:12.811 --> 42:15.044
about to receive
from Thy bounty.

42:15.046 --> 42:17.814
Through Christ, our Lord. Amen.
