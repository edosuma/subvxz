WEBVTT

00:05.422 --> 00:07.253
Gannicus:
See end to vengeance.

00:07.424 --> 00:10.086
Take the life of Glaber's woman
as he took the life of yours.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.637
The child is yours!

00:12.804 --> 00:15.762
Lucretia: You sought Praetor
Varinius' affections once.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.595
Send message,
and you could yet gain them.

00:18.769 --> 00:19.884
Do you not see it?

00:20.062 --> 00:22.769
The gods have lead me
upon path to Gaius,

00:22.940 --> 00:25.431
as their will
has removed llithyia from it.

00:25.609 --> 00:27.349
Have you lost mind?

00:27.528 --> 00:29.109
Lucretia:
It's your brother's, is it not?

00:29.279 --> 00:32.066
- How did you come by this?
- Hidden amongst Ashur's treasures.

00:33.075 --> 00:35.282
Yet the villain
moves only upon command

00:35.452 --> 00:39.115
of Gaius Claudius Glaber.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.574
Crixus:
Glaber agrees to terms.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.707
Spartacus:
I am for Atella. To see it done.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.619
He chose vengeance against me
over your life.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.124
You let me live?

00:51.385 --> 00:52.875
Do not think it a kindness.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.589
(theme music playing )

01:05.732 --> 01:07.643
(liquid splashing)

01:09.236 --> 01:11.978
(sighs)

01:14.658 --> 01:15.647
( blow strikes )

01:20.581 --> 01:22.117
Lugo...

01:22.291 --> 01:24.327
open fucking eyes.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.116
To see what?

01:26.295 --> 01:30.038
Wake when trees attack,
little man.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.127
- ( grunts)
- ( grunts)

02:03.165 --> 02:05.998
- Romans!
- Fucking Romans! Move!

02:06.168 --> 02:08.204
- ( overlapping clamor)
- We're under attack!

02:20.599 --> 02:22.214
My sword!

02:25.854 --> 02:27.390
Enough!

02:27.564 --> 02:29.020
( all gasping )

02:29.191 --> 02:30.522
(woman speaks )

02:30.692 --> 02:32.023
Stand down!

02:32.194 --> 02:35.152
( man speaking )

02:40.952 --> 02:43.864
Agron:
This was but fucking test?

02:44.039 --> 02:45.529
If it had not been,

02:45.707 --> 02:48.164
you would all
be for the afterlife.

02:49.628 --> 02:53.246
We will not be taken
unaware next time.

02:56.385 --> 03:00.719
I would see words
forged into action.

03:00.889 --> 03:04.723
Rise, and take morning meal.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.559
The day ahead of us
will be long.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.961
It causes worry

03:35.132 --> 03:38.295
to stir and find you
gone from our bed.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.214
I could not remain there.

03:42.597 --> 03:46.135
The mind churns with thoughts
of those taken too soon from us

03:46.309 --> 03:49.642
and the monsters who tore them
from loving embrace.

03:57.070 --> 04:01.313
We have both suffered
immeasurable loss.

04:02.784 --> 04:06.697
We must take comforts
from what we have found...

04:07.998 --> 04:09.659
...in each other.

04:12.002 --> 04:15.290
l have moved foolishly
and with regret

04:15.464 --> 04:16.795
that l have denied
you opportunity

04:16.965 --> 04:18.466
to properly
mourn your wife.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.794
She is but fleeting memory...

04:26.475 --> 04:28.466
one that shall fade...

04:29.811 --> 04:34.521
as the night mist caressed
by morning sun.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.572
( gasps )

04:51.750 --> 04:53.160
llithyia.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.099
( rushing water echoes )

05:16.566 --> 05:18.477
( soft distorted speaking )

05:21.780 --> 05:23.736
She lives.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.235
She will survive it.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.742
What of the child?

05:32.916 --> 05:35.202
lt yet moves within her.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.242
-( normal sound resumes)
- She wakes.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.582
Out.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.887
Are you of this world?

05:50.058 --> 05:52.424
Take hand...

05:54.104 --> 05:55.765
and know that I am flesh.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.679
Leave us.

06:00.610 --> 06:03.272
lthoughtyou
gone from this world.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.528
As did I.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.111
Yet the gods have seen me
returned to your arms.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.116
It is a blessing.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.403
One shared by our child.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.792
The warmth
of the life inside me,

06:18.962 --> 06:21.624
it gave strength and comfort

06:21.798 --> 06:23.299
when all seemed lost.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.091
How did you escape?

06:27.262 --> 06:29.344
I could not.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.095
He let me go.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.255
Spartacus released you?

06:32.434 --> 06:35.176
He said that taking my life

06:35.353 --> 06:37.093
would have no meaning.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.637
And where were you held?

06:38.815 --> 06:41.056
I do not know.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.225
l was bound
and stripped of sight.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.019
How did Gannicus
carry you to him?

06:46.197 --> 06:48.108
By horse for part of a day.

06:48.283 --> 06:51.366
By foot through woods
for hours more.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.821
And you saw nothing
of their camp?

06:52.996 --> 06:54.827
Only the dank hole
they kept me.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.831
Dug into the earth
Or made of stone and wood?

06:58.001 --> 06:59.741
What does it fucking matter?

07:01.004 --> 07:03.837
It was made of stone,

07:04.007 --> 07:05.838
with beams of wood,

07:06.009 --> 07:08.421
scribblings carved
into the rock.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.506
- What did they say?
- I do not know.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.841
They were faded
and broken.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.426
In what tongue
were they etched?

07:14.601 --> 07:16.637
They appeared Greek.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.855
Why am | not
in our bedchambers?

07:23.026 --> 07:25.438
- llithyia--
- I thought it a dream.

07:28.865 --> 07:32.653
Seppia in your arms?

07:32.827 --> 07:34.533
Your hands upon her?

07:35.914 --> 07:37.779
Spartacus was right.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.450
My death would not
have held meaning.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.542
You do not love me.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.800
And you greet this
as revelation?

07:53.807 --> 07:56.549
Time and again,
you tore my heart from my chest.

07:56.726 --> 08:00.890
Is it a wonder it now
stands empty in your regard?

08:05.777 --> 08:08.393
Is there nothing left
between us?

08:11.032 --> 08:13.193
I once asked the same of you.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.197
Do you recall your reply?

08:16.371 --> 08:19.738
Have I not suffered
enough for it?

08:19.916 --> 08:22.874
I would have life as it was,

08:23.044 --> 08:25.581
with my husband beside me.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.746
The man you speak of
no longer exists.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.961
Then what stands before me

08:31.136 --> 08:33.878
assuming his manner and form?

08:34.055 --> 08:36.046
A monster...

08:37.434 --> 08:40.597
rough-hewn
by unfortunate events...

08:42.272 --> 08:44.513
and given breath
by necessity.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.522
(overlapping clamoring )

08:55.535 --> 08:57.446
We cannot defend the temple

08:57.620 --> 08:59.156
if we are at odds
with one another.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.945
Give Lugo a warrior
to share watch,

09:01.124 --> 09:03.581
not little man
with little balls.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.242
My balls did not allow breach.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.579
Your eyes were closed
in pursuit of dreams.

09:08.757 --> 09:09.872
You fell to slumber?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.631
And you blame Nasir,
you lazy shit?

09:11.801 --> 09:13.666
Turn effort
from defending your boy,

09:13.845 --> 09:14.960
and look upon
your own failings.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.344
Then let us relive the moment

09:16.514 --> 09:17.503
and see different
fucking result.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.593
The Romans will come.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.181
And if they find us divided,

09:24.355 --> 09:25.936
we will fall before them.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.519
- Words of meaning.
- She speaks the truth.

09:28.693 --> 09:29.808
What would you have us do?

09:29.986 --> 09:31.487
Try not to get
your head fucking bashed.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.485
Bold words from one
who tumbled so quickly.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.157
l was absent fucking sword!

09:35.325 --> 09:37.691
Why does little man
have sword, and not Lugo?

09:37.869 --> 09:39.325
We cannot face the Romans
with fucking sticks.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.282
Then I will teach you the bow.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.791
- ( laughter)
- We are from east of the Rhine.

09:46.961 --> 09:50.124
- We fight with fucking steel.
- We must use what we have.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.216
She asks why
you let llithyia go

09:59.390 --> 10:00.846
when Glaber did not
trade weapons as promised.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.632
A thing I have also wondered.

10:07.982 --> 10:12.191
Taking her life would not
have gained us what we need.

10:12.362 --> 10:15.354
It would only have served
misplaced vengeance.

10:15.532 --> 10:18.069
We are better than this.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.529
We are better than the Romans.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.239
Oenomaus,

10:22.413 --> 10:25.155
Gannicus, see everyone
to guarded position.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.540
We will train against assault
by light of day

10:27.710 --> 10:30.543
and attempt to elevate
night's low defeat.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.374
Let us see it done.

10:32.549 --> 10:33.880
l have no need of aid.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.915
Lugo,Nash,

10:36.094 --> 10:37.379
take position upon wall.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.878
Donar, Nemetes,

10:40.056 --> 10:43.219
Lydon, Saxa, fall to my side!

10:46.229 --> 10:49.517
I fear result will be the same
in light of day.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.397
We are not a fist,

10:51.568 --> 10:55.060
but fingers twitching
absent single purpose.

10:55.238 --> 10:56.648
Oenomaus:
Lugo, form one.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.109
- My words crash upon ear...
- Begin.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.569
...but fail to pierce heart.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.734
Then we must stab deeper.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.238
Perhaps punishment

11:06.416 --> 11:08.623
for those who fail
in the day's training?

11:08.793 --> 11:10.078
You cannot forge
trust and loyalty

11:10.253 --> 11:12.118
at the ends of a whip,
as the Romans believe.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.253
Then what would you use?

11:14.424 --> 11:17.416
Soft kisses
and whispers of love?

11:21.097 --> 11:23.338
Gather Fulco and Harudes.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.256
There is a thing
lwould have you do.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.391
What are your thoughts?

11:29.522 --> 11:33.106
To see fingers
joined in single purpose.

11:33.276 --> 11:35.107
( laughs)

11:44.537 --> 11:46.493
It is a thing of much regret.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.411
Lucius is no longer among us.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.796
A loss keenly felt.

12:03.473 --> 12:06.306
Yet we must move
from wounded heart,

12:06.476 --> 12:08.762
turn towards
what must be done.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.310
I would have
you train more archers,

12:11.481 --> 12:13.472
as you suggested.

12:14.609 --> 12:16.224
Is that all
you would have from me?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.491
Gather your bow.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.485
You have not slept by my side.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.825
You do not speak,
unless to give order.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.614
How long do you seek
to punish me?

12:31.793 --> 12:33.624
It is not my intent.

12:33.795 --> 12:37.037
Yet result stands the same.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.456
- You turn from me.
- You turned from yourself

12:39.634 --> 12:41.841
when you made attempt
upon llithyia,

12:42.011 --> 12:44.093
an act that would have
stained you forever.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.676
I thought only to save you
from the same.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.976
You thought to save
what we had.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.646
Had?

12:57.151 --> 12:59.187
Can you no longer
find comfort in my arms?

13:00.196 --> 13:01.732
Can you find such in mine?

13:01.906 --> 13:03.407
Yes...

13:05.535 --> 13:07.992
if you would but give me
more of your heart.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.037
l have given all that remains.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.550
It is not enough.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.136
No.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.725
It is not.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.692
I felt it

13:41.863 --> 13:43.694
since the very start,

13:43.865 --> 13:45.947
an absence in your touch,

13:46.117 --> 13:47.903
no matter how warm,

13:48.077 --> 13:50.238
an emptiness.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.117
I turned from it,

13:54.292 --> 13:56.874
certain one day
I would be able to fill it.

13:57.045 --> 14:01.334
The gods themselves
would fail such effort.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.587
Will it move you...

14:07.388 --> 14:09.845
one day when you see me
in the arms of another?

14:11.684 --> 14:13.390
I will know the sting of it...

14:15.605 --> 14:19.314
yet I pray
you find in them...

14:21.861 --> 14:24.022
what you could not
find in mine.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.376
Let us see to training

14:40.546 --> 14:42.286
and what must be done.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.859
Spartacus' voice:
He does not love you.

15:06.030 --> 15:09.488
- llithyia's voice: You let me live?
- Do not think it a kindness.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.150
llithyia?

15:16.666 --> 15:19.578
(sobs)

15:22.964 --> 15:25.171
The gods have heard my prayers

15:25.341 --> 15:28.174
to return you to my arms.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.255
You alone offer such embrace.

15:30.430 --> 15:34.173
l have not taken food nor rest
since you were torn from them.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.886
Nor would I have,

15:36.060 --> 15:38.221
until I had followed you
to suspected fate.

15:38.396 --> 15:41.012
Would that all
held me as close to heart.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.181
Well, you're the reason
that mine still beats,

15:43.359 --> 15:46.522
you and the blessing you carry.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.407
l have never
considered it as such.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.196
Yet in that final moment,

15:54.370 --> 15:56.201
when I thought life
was forfeit,

15:56.372 --> 16:00.832
I felt a great sadness,

16:01.002 --> 16:02.538
not for myself,

16:02.712 --> 16:04.873
but for innocent child,

16:05.047 --> 16:07.880
doomed to suffer
for the mistakes of the mother.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.179
We have both made many.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.511
The child is Spartacus'.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.017
He gave seed

16:24.192 --> 16:26.854
the night you maneuvered me
into laying with him.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.393
llithyia--

16:28.571 --> 16:30.812
| no longer
lay blame at your feet.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.857
It was my hands that forced you
to seek vengeance,

16:35.036 --> 16:38.403
my choices
that have cast me adrift...

16:39.582 --> 16:42.790
clinging to a woman
I once hated

16:42.960 --> 16:47.249
and a child I unreasonably
grow to love.

16:47.423 --> 16:53.009
To feel such hope and such joy
blossoming within you,

16:53.179 --> 16:55.841
that's the rarest
of all flowers,

16:56.015 --> 16:57.926
regardless of why it blooms.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.591
( footsteps )

17:00.770 --> 17:02.931
Apologies, |--

17:03.105 --> 17:05.312
I did not know you were--

17:05.483 --> 17:07.348
Apologies.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.646
She moves to assume
my place at Gaius' side.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.402
One day, she will see him
for what he truly is.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.787
Oh, her eyes
have already been opened.

17:23.668 --> 17:27.206
Seppius was not murdered
by his slaves,

17:27.380 --> 17:29.291
but by your husband.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.126
Gaius?

17:31.300 --> 17:32.631
A thing which I discovered

17:32.802 --> 17:35.384
through most unfortunate manner

17:35.555 --> 17:37.967
and shared only with Seppia.

17:39.267 --> 17:42.009
Yet she stays
within this house...

17:43.354 --> 17:46.141
body offered to the man
that so wounded her?

17:46.315 --> 17:49.307
To leave now would only serve
to arouse suspicion.

17:50.820 --> 17:54.813
Yet she burns with thoughts
of avenging her brother.

17:56.325 --> 18:00.284
I would see such embers
given breath...

18:01.998 --> 18:04.330
and in resulting flames...

18:06.335 --> 18:08.872
my child and l

18:09.046 --> 18:12.880
to rise from the ashes
of ill-fated past.

18:13.050 --> 18:15.211
They traveled by horse,

18:15.386 --> 18:18.253
then on foot through forest
for several hours,

18:18.431 --> 18:21.798
yet she does not know
what direction she traveled in.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.011
Man:
Open the gates!

18:23.185 --> 18:26.052
Spartacus has attacked
the mine of Lucania here,

18:26.230 --> 18:27.891
the arena in Capua,

18:28.065 --> 18:29.851
port of Neapolis,

18:30.026 --> 18:33.610
and attempted to make trade
in Atella.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.156
The curve
would suggest they move

18:36.324 --> 18:39.191
outward from a central position,
this region.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.029
Yet a vast area.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.904
Did she mention anything more

18:45.082 --> 18:47.744
that may be of use?

18:47.918 --> 18:50.375
Only that she was kept
beneath ground

18:50.546 --> 18:53.083
in a chamber
with faded lettering,

18:53.257 --> 18:56.215
perhaps Greek in origin.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.172
Hmm.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.008
Apologies.

19:04.393 --> 19:07.260
He's a Roman--
Lucius Caelius...

19:08.272 --> 19:10.263
from Vesuvius.

19:10.441 --> 19:12.807
( exhales, chuckles )

19:12.985 --> 19:14.771
See yourself to wine and food.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.606
His efforts bear fruit?

19:16.781 --> 19:20.319
Plucked from Spartacus'
own garden.

19:22.995 --> 19:27.455
His overly ripe friend
goes by name of Lucius Caelius,

19:27.625 --> 19:28.956
known by those questioned

19:29.126 --> 19:31.583
to frequent market
in Neapolis and Atella

19:31.754 --> 19:34.666
and to dwell
in the shadows of Vesuvius.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.705
Still too vast an area.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.294
Made smaller by your wife's
discerning eyes.

19:38.469 --> 19:41.836
There is a temple
near mountain's foot,

19:42.014 --> 19:43.595
long abandoned,

19:43.766 --> 19:46.132
erected many years past

19:46.310 --> 19:50.269
by Greek hands.

19:51.941 --> 19:54.557
Then we march at nightfall

19:54.735 --> 19:58.569
and by dawn's light
see an end to Spartacus.

19:58.739 --> 20:01.355
lwould urge
no small amount of caution.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.865
If memory serve,

20:03.035 --> 20:05.447
there's a wall
protecting this temple.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.488
Spartacus and his men will
surely have fortified position.

20:08.666 --> 20:12.500
Then we shall bring to bear
the fiery might of Rome

20:12.670 --> 20:16.458
and see defenses fall
in advance of the man himself.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.963
Prepare your men.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.090
And lwould have you
at my side

20:20.261 --> 20:21.751
to share in glorious moment.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.428
A great honor.

20:26.809 --> 20:30.097
It shames me
to seek reward beyond it,

20:30.271 --> 20:33.479
yet hard desires
turn reason a fool.

20:33.649 --> 20:34.855
You are many things, Syrian,

20:35.025 --> 20:37.061
but do not expect me
to believe you a fool.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.394
Give voice to your desire.

20:40.573 --> 20:44.316
See it considered.

20:44.493 --> 20:47.075
(yelling)

20:54.128 --> 20:55.208
Nemetes,

20:55.379 --> 20:57.620
you attack
before command is given.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.709
We must remain hidden
until the Romans are drawn in.

20:59.884 --> 21:01.215
You would see them
breach the wall?

21:01.385 --> 21:02.841
We would see them trapped,
you simple fuck.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.343
Like fish in a net.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.128
Wagon approaches.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.343
Nasir: Agron leads it.

21:10.352 --> 21:13.094
He has attacked another one,
without command.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.433
No. He acts upon my orders.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.848
Towards what purpose?

21:17.026 --> 21:19.358
To secure
what we desperately need.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.519
( laughter)

21:27.703 --> 21:30.490
I barely know the man
absent furrowed brow.

21:30.664 --> 21:32.950
He is not a man
of drunken pursuits.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.207
His brow may not reveal it,

21:35.377 --> 21:37.368
but there is
yet intent upon mind.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.037
lt lifts heart

21:40.216 --> 21:42.832
to hear voices
raised in spirit...

21:44.345 --> 21:45.710
to see us bonded...

21:45.888 --> 21:47.219
( cheering )

21:47.389 --> 21:49.380
...not by brand,

21:49.558 --> 21:51.423
not by homeland,

21:51.602 --> 21:54.935
but by an ideal

21:55.105 --> 21:57.391
that every man...

21:58.734 --> 22:01.225
every woman

22:01.403 --> 22:04.236
should be born, should live,
and should die

22:04.406 --> 22:07.113
with the taste of freedom
forever upon their lips.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.195
- ( cheering )
- Yeah!

22:09.370 --> 22:14.740
Yet if we are
to defeat the Romans,

22:14.917 --> 22:17.158
we must put aside
our differences

22:17.336 --> 22:18.837
and come together as one.

22:19.922 --> 22:20.911
Let us have sport,

22:21.090 --> 22:22.876
pairing those
of you with ill feelings

22:23.050 --> 22:24.915
against your equals,

22:25.094 --> 22:26.925
and let us see

22:27.096 --> 22:29.633
if thirst for victory
triumphs petty quarrel.

22:29.807 --> 22:31.798
lntent is revealed.

22:31.976 --> 22:34.513
- Donar!
- ( cheering )

22:34.687 --> 22:35.893
Nemetes!

22:36.063 --> 22:38.679
- ( cheering )
- Spartacus: Take position.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.733
- Lugo!
- Yeah!

22:42.903 --> 22:46.111
Nasir! You will face them.

22:48.492 --> 22:52.110
We win if you keep
out of way, little man.

22:52.288 --> 22:55.780
-( laughs)
- Don't fucking call me that.

22:55.958 --> 22:57.744
(yells)

23:27.615 --> 23:28.650
( laughs)

23:28.824 --> 23:30.815
Begin!

23:32.161 --> 23:34.618
It is a thing of beauty,
is it not...

23:37.124 --> 23:39.456
what a man
may accomplish

23:39.627 --> 23:42.619
if mind is set
to purpose?

23:47.301 --> 23:48.837
Yet there's something missing.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.503
Freedom.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.766
To see treasures put to use
absent constraint,

23:56.936 --> 23:59.928
to live, knowing
each choice made...

24:01.774 --> 24:03.139
is your own.

24:03.317 --> 24:05.308
( scoffs )

24:05.486 --> 24:08.523
( laughs)

24:08.697 --> 24:12.531
Spartacus and I stand together
in such desires.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.033
Then you find yourself
in low company.

24:15.204 --> 24:18.696
Soon to be elevated.

24:20.042 --> 24:22.078
Ashur has done the impossible
and discovered

24:22.252 --> 24:24.334
where the dreaded villain
secrets himself,

24:24.505 --> 24:25.995
and in reward...

24:27.341 --> 24:29.707
Glaber bestows
deepest wish...

24:31.136 --> 24:32.876
upon me.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.886
He sets you free?

24:35.057 --> 24:37.719
After we take Spartacus
at Vesuvius.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.972
Yet releasing me from bond

24:41.146 --> 24:44.388
is but a taste of more...

24:46.443 --> 24:48.149
sumptuous meal.

24:49.697 --> 24:53.110
One which you
shall feast upon alone.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.490
After Spartacus is defeated,

24:55.661 --> 24:59.245
llithyia will return to Rome
with her husband,

24:59.415 --> 25:02.248
and trusted friend
will be at her side.

25:02.418 --> 25:05.125
I fear llithyia
must find a new one.

25:11.427 --> 25:14.089
You will remain here

25:14.263 --> 25:17.130
to assume mantle

25:17.307 --> 25:19.559
of loving wife.

25:20.769 --> 25:23.556
Glaber will not allow this.

25:23.731 --> 25:25.062
He more than allows it.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.314
He gives union blessing

25:27.484 --> 25:31.272
and presents gift
of this ludus

25:31.447 --> 25:33.938
in recognition
of honored service.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.982
He gives you
my husband's legacy?

25:40.289 --> 25:43.406
We shall forge a new one,
my love,

25:43.584 --> 25:45.791
as husband and wife,

25:45.961 --> 25:47.747
and together...

25:49.173 --> 25:50.959
...we shall see the noble rise

25:51.133 --> 25:55.467
of the House of Ashur.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.054
(whimpers)

25:59.224 --> 26:02.057
Have the men equipped,
ready to travel by sunrise.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.013
See that it happens.

26:05.856 --> 26:08.142
You were able to acquire
what is needed?

26:08.317 --> 26:09.807
Move! Hup!

26:09.985 --> 26:11.270
They are upon road
from Neapolis.

26:11.445 --> 26:13.401
Meet them, and hasten arrival.

26:14.490 --> 26:17.323
lwill hold no delay
in marching south.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.779
Varinius: lwould advise
a different course.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.748
l have been dispatched
with message from the Senate.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.834
You are to cease
pursuit of Spartacus

26:33.008 --> 26:34.339
and return to Rome immediately.

26:34.510 --> 26:36.375
lam a praetor of the Republic.

26:36.553 --> 26:39.386
The Senate holds no power
to make such demands of me.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.217
True, they do not.

26:41.391 --> 26:44.053
They have only the power
to recommend a path of action,

26:44.228 --> 26:46.344
one only a man
with no intent to rise

26:46.522 --> 26:48.763
above current position
would ignore.

26:48.941 --> 26:50.852
And they send words
through the man

26:51.026 --> 26:53.813
who conspires
to claim my wife?

26:59.618 --> 27:02.075
I am hardly alone
in such ambitions, am |?

27:03.247 --> 27:05.283
Troubling news
has lit upon ear

27:05.457 --> 27:08.164
that Spartacus has seized
what I could not.

27:08.335 --> 27:09.791
You do not know
of what you speak.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.327
And you are
an incompetent fool

27:11.505 --> 27:13.370
to allow your wife
to be taken by a slave.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.790
llithyia: Taken?

27:18.345 --> 27:20.210
llithyia?

27:21.390 --> 27:24.974
It appears
you have been misinformed.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.930
l have been taken only to bed,

27:27.104 --> 27:29.811
my child causing
unexpected discomfort

27:29.982 --> 27:32.268
in waning months
of pregnancy.

27:32.442 --> 27:34.569
Did it also cause
the bruise upon your cheek?

27:36.905 --> 27:39.738
No, it did not.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.694
( laughs )
The fault was mine.

27:41.869 --> 27:45.737
A misplaced step
as l was coming from the bath.

27:48.584 --> 27:49.915
You should choose footing
more carefully.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.246
As you should choose
your words.

28:02.973 --> 28:05.464
Return home, Gaius,

28:05.642 --> 28:07.553
and tend to your wife

28:07.728 --> 28:09.389
before yet another man
makes attempt upon her.

28:09.563 --> 28:11.554
I shall take my leave
when Spartacus falls.

28:11.732 --> 28:13.313
A task long overdue
in its completion.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.189
Yet now within grasp.

28:15.360 --> 28:18.102
l march to Vesuvius
and an end to the man.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.441
Vesuvius?

28:21.783 --> 28:23.114
Is that where he hides?

28:23.285 --> 28:24.866
It is of no concern to you.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.447
The Senate believes otherwise.

28:26.622 --> 28:27.953
I've been appointed
to assume your place

28:28.123 --> 28:30.990
with an army of worth
and bring Spartacus to justice.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.660
And if I refuse to step aside?

28:34.838 --> 28:36.499
It is a choice
you are free to make,

28:36.673 --> 28:39.255
but one that would end
all hope of rising

28:39.426 --> 28:41.792
from the shit
you have mired yourself in.

28:42.888 --> 28:45.721
Save what little worth
your name yet holds,

28:45.891 --> 28:48.803
and set path towards Rome.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.479
Varinius!

29:02.658 --> 29:04.865
Thank the gods
you received my message!

29:05.035 --> 29:06.070
And I respond to it,

29:06.245 --> 29:08.611
only to find llithyia
safely within these walls.

29:08.789 --> 29:11.326
- Spartacus freed her.
- Why would he show mercy

29:11.500 --> 29:13.161
to the wife of the man
that hunts him?

29:13.335 --> 29:16.042
| make no attempt to understand
the mind of a slave.

29:16.213 --> 29:19.046
Your time instead spent
inventing tales of abduction.

29:19.216 --> 29:21.548
Does what you write of
your brother hold similar merit?

29:21.718 --> 29:23.925
Everything I have
told you is true.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.552
Gaius took the life
of my brother.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.587
And what evidence do you claim

29:27.766 --> 29:29.472
to dare place charge
against a praetor of Rome?

29:29.643 --> 29:31.133
Seppius' bracelet,

29:31.311 --> 29:33.597
a mirror of my own,
found hidden

29:33.772 --> 29:35.353
among the belongings
of a man loyal to--

29:35.524 --> 29:36.855
A fucking bracelet
is all you hold?

29:37.025 --> 29:38.356
You stupid little girl.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.688
Please do not turn from this.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.523
Gaius must pay
for what he's done.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.734
I hold no love for the man,

29:44.908 --> 29:47.024
yet to make accusation based
upon the air and teary eye

29:47.202 --> 29:49.534
would serve no purpose.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.575
Nor will further words.

30:05.262 --> 30:07.253
( cheering )

30:24.197 --> 30:26.028
Yeah!

30:27.242 --> 30:29.699
You lower guard
just before launching attack.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.485
Advice gained too late.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.699
- We lose.
- Yeah!

30:36.877 --> 30:41.166
But little man
fight like giant!

30:49.848 --> 30:51.088
( laughs)

30:57.272 --> 30:58.637
( laughs)

31:13.580 --> 31:14.786
( laughs)

31:33.308 --> 31:35.299
( cheering continues)

31:44.653 --> 31:48.020
a clever strategy
to forge necessary bonds.

31:49.491 --> 31:51.573
And I would see more follow.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.366
Battle well fought.

31:56.540 --> 31:58.201
( cheering )

31:58.375 --> 32:00.616
Let us have new contest!

32:00.794 --> 32:02.330
Agron!

32:02.504 --> 32:03.994
( cheering )

32:04.172 --> 32:05.161
Crixus!

32:05.340 --> 32:07.422
( cheering )

32:13.557 --> 32:15.047
Get him, Agron!

32:15.225 --> 32:16.510
He's too fast for you, Agron!

32:16.685 --> 32:18.801
Take position.

32:20.564 --> 32:23.055
- ( murmuring)
- ( laughter)

32:24.860 --> 32:26.066
Gannicus!

32:26.236 --> 32:27.817
- Huh?
- ( cheering)

32:27.988 --> 32:29.979
Oenomaus!

32:30.157 --> 32:31.317
Stand against them.

32:31.491 --> 32:32.651
- ( cheering )
- Yeah!

32:32.826 --> 32:33.941
Yeah!

32:36.037 --> 32:38.949
We can easily best them
if we fight as one.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.372
Hold this, you fuck.

32:41.543 --> 32:43.374
Do not drink it.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.667
- Come...
- Come on, Oenomaus!

32:47.841 --> 32:49.377
...and do what is necessary.

32:53.054 --> 32:54.885
-( laughs)
- Yes!

32:55.056 --> 32:57.047
( cheering )

33:03.398 --> 33:04.558
Ready?

33:16.453 --> 33:17.738
Begin!

33:29.758 --> 33:31.623
Naevia: Come on, Crixus!

33:31.801 --> 33:34.053
Teach him who
the true champion is, Crixus!

33:34.221 --> 33:36.587
lt astounds to witness
the change in you.

33:36.765 --> 33:39.256
The world itself
can reverse course

33:39.434 --> 33:42.096
when moved by loving hands.

33:43.605 --> 33:45.095
A blessing...

33:46.316 --> 33:48.978
to hold each other
in such regard.

33:49.152 --> 33:50.767
As Spartacus holds you.

33:52.447 --> 33:53.948
No longer.

34:01.915 --> 34:04.247
(yells)

34:17.347 --> 34:18.632
( laughs)

34:32.571 --> 34:34.311
( laughs)

34:39.202 --> 34:40.988
( cheering )

34:43.999 --> 34:45.330
( laughs)

34:50.130 --> 34:51.995
That was well put.

34:55.093 --> 34:57.175
You almost had them.

34:57.345 --> 34:59.336
Almost.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.270
Agron.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.520
You fought well

35:09.691 --> 35:11.773
for a simple fuck
from the east of the Rhine.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.476
As did you

35:14.654 --> 35:16.690
for a shit-eating Gaul.

35:16.865 --> 35:18.901
( both laugh )

35:19.075 --> 35:22.533
Let us share drink
and balm wounded pride.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.714
( laughter echoes )

35:40.889 --> 35:44.052
Lucretia:
To suffer the sting of loss

35:44.225 --> 35:47.888
absent course
to right what has been done.

35:48.063 --> 35:52.056
I sent for Varinius,
as you prompted...

35:53.902 --> 35:56.735
only to have him
shun word

35:56.905 --> 35:58.395
and touch.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.865
You are no longer a girl,

36:03.036 --> 36:05.402
unblemished by the world.

36:07.207 --> 36:09.038
You're a woman now.

36:10.293 --> 36:12.534
And our hands
shape the fates

36:12.712 --> 36:14.088
when those
of men tremble.

36:14.255 --> 36:16.382
It is I who tremble.

36:17.759 --> 36:19.920
The thought of Gaius' hands
upon me.

36:20.095 --> 36:22.427
(crying)

36:22.597 --> 36:24.679
There, there.

36:24.849 --> 36:26.760
Shh.

36:28.478 --> 36:30.969
It is such desire...

36:32.107 --> 36:34.473
that presents opportunity.

36:39.572 --> 36:40.982
You suggest the impossible.

36:41.157 --> 36:42.988
| suggest only

36:43.159 --> 36:46.447
that you consider the years
unfolding before you,

36:46.621 --> 36:49.454
every moment swollen
with the knowledge

36:49.624 --> 36:52.457
that Gaius Claudius Glaber

36:52.627 --> 36:56.085
lives out his life
in the privileged lap of Rome...

36:57.382 --> 37:02.172
while your brother
is forever denied breath.

37:02.345 --> 37:03.676
It should not be so.

37:03.847 --> 37:06.133
It should not.

37:07.475 --> 37:10.842
Everything I held dear

37:11.020 --> 37:13.762
was taken from me as well,

37:13.940 --> 37:15.931
this house,

37:16.109 --> 37:18.646
my husband,

37:18.820 --> 37:20.776
promise of a child.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.696
The things
that have been done to us

37:23.867 --> 37:26.279
cannot stand unanswered.

37:26.453 --> 37:28.990
To allow it...

37:30.707 --> 37:33.369
would be to turn from those

37:33.543 --> 37:35.659
we claim to have loved.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.427
Is there no other course?

37:50.602 --> 37:54.811
If you wish to see
your brother's murder avenged...

37:56.524 --> 37:58.731
blood must be spilled.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.028
She is moved towards deed?

38:46.199 --> 38:47.530
I believe it so.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.315
Are you certain
this is what you desire?

38:50.411 --> 38:52.618
If Gaius is not moved
by pleading word,

38:52.789 --> 38:55.371
then lwill have
blood and death

38:55.542 --> 38:57.703
and, in the bringing of it,

38:57.877 --> 39:00.368
my life returned to me.

39:13.601 --> 39:14.932
Seppia: Is it true?

39:15.103 --> 39:16.764
That you depart for Rome?

39:16.938 --> 39:18.644
I'm left with little choice.

39:18.815 --> 39:22.148
It is a terrible thing
to be stripped of such.

39:23.444 --> 39:26.277
Made more grievous
by hand that removes it.

39:26.447 --> 39:28.062
You speak of Varinius?

39:28.241 --> 39:30.448
He once more makes attempt

39:30.618 --> 39:32.609
to claim
what is rightfully mine.

39:32.787 --> 39:34.778
As Spartacus claimed
my brother's life?

39:40.962 --> 39:42.748
An unfortunate tragedy.

39:42.922 --> 39:45.083
One that yet demands justice.

39:45.258 --> 39:47.965
The Senate appoints
Varinius the task.

39:48.136 --> 39:50.218
(metal jingles)

39:50.388 --> 39:53.221
I do not have faith in him
to take the life of the man

39:53.391 --> 39:55.507
responsible
for grievous injury.

39:58.146 --> 39:59.636
Nor l.

40:01.941 --> 40:05.684
Yet we must turn
from such thought

40:05.862 --> 40:09.730
and seek comfort in the hands
of warm embrace.

40:23.338 --> 40:26.455
Your fucking hands ripped
my brother from this world,

40:26.633 --> 40:28.919
and mine shall see you from it.

41:25.608 --> 41:27.109
Gaius.

41:29.404 --> 41:31.235
I cast you aside.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.605
Yet you save my life?

41:34.784 --> 41:36.900
You are my husband.

41:39.080 --> 41:41.571
We cannot be what we were.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.419
Then let us be what we are.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.371
We have done terrible things
to each other.

41:50.466 --> 41:53.583
I would see such venom
turned outward

41:53.761 --> 41:56.218
to those truly deserving of it,

41:56.389 --> 41:58.254
Seppia,

41:58.433 --> 41:59.764
the Senate,

41:59.934 --> 42:03.768
and the man they dispatch
to steal your glory.

42:06.941 --> 42:09.774
You would move
against Varinius?

42:11.279 --> 42:14.021
We are both monsters, Gaius.

42:15.199 --> 42:16.780
Let us be so together

42:16.951 --> 42:21.115
and seize the fucking heavens.

42:32.842 --> 42:35.800
I shall march to Vesuvius,

42:35.970 --> 42:37.471
see it done.

42:42.143 --> 42:44.179
Pause but a moment.

42:46.272 --> 42:49.981
l have been too long absent
you inside me.

43:19.138 --> 43:20.594
Forgive me.

43:20.765 --> 43:22.505
I lose myself in the moment.

43:22.683 --> 43:24.184
No.

43:26.270 --> 43:28.556
It is I who have been lost...

43:37.073 --> 43:40.361
and your touch
that guides me home.

43:57.343 --> 43:58.378
(all singing)

43:58.553 --> 44:00.794
J‘ And lift your sword J‘

44:00.972 --> 44:02.678
J‘ Drain your wine J‘

44:02.849 --> 44:04.805
J‘ Drain your cock J‘

44:05.935 --> 44:08.893
J‘ Dawn comes tOO SOOI‘I J‘

44:09.063 --> 44:11.930
J‘ Night flees too soon J‘

44:12.108 --> 44:15.396
J‘ So lift fucking cup J‘

44:15.570 --> 44:16.605
J‘ Lift fucking cup... J‘

44:16.779 --> 44:19.236
I still believe you will see us all
to untimely end.

44:19.407 --> 44:21.523
Man:
J‘ Drain my cock J‘

44:21.701 --> 44:23.783
J‘ Drain my cock. J‘

44:23.953 --> 44:26.820
Yet it will be
a glorious fucking death.

44:26.998 --> 44:29.910
( laughs)

44:32.128 --> 44:34.210
The signal.

44:41.888 --> 44:43.298
Glaber.

44:43.472 --> 44:45.463
( overlapping chatter)

44:53.941 --> 44:55.806
Glaber commands from the rear,

44:55.985 --> 44:58.146
a coward's position.

44:58.321 --> 45:01.108
He will advance his troops
in tight formation,

45:01.282 --> 45:03.113
intending to overpower.

45:04.452 --> 45:05.988
It is the Roman way.

45:07.622 --> 45:10.580
We will teach them ours.

45:10.750 --> 45:12.615
( cheering )

45:50.539 --> 45:52.530
(yelling)

45:57.838 --> 46:00.375
- Soldier: Advance!
- ( yelling )

46:16.983 --> 46:19.725
- Fall back to the temple!
- Advance!

46:29.078 --> 46:30.989
- Fulco!
- Hold the line!

46:31.163 --> 46:33.415
- There are too many!
- Move!

46:38.921 --> 46:40.252
Praeto r!

46:40.423 --> 46:42.584
The rebels are in retreat.

46:46.012 --> 46:48.128
(yelling)

46:50.099 --> 46:52.010
( neighs )

46:59.775 --> 47:00.764
( neighs )

47:00.943 --> 47:03.104
Stage one.

47:03.279 --> 47:04.735
Two.

47:04.905 --> 47:06.770
Three. Advance!

47:06.949 --> 47:08.689
(yelling)

47:31.140 --> 47:32.129
Crixus: Now!

48:06.509 --> 48:08.966
( neighs )

48:11.972 --> 48:14.224
You are not the man I seek.

48:46.549 --> 48:48.039
Lay down your arms!

48:49.468 --> 48:50.969
Do it!

48:53.556 --> 48:55.968
Now we have steel.

48:56.142 --> 48:57.473
AM: Yeah!

48:57.643 --> 48:59.474
Gather their weapons.

48:59.645 --> 49:01.977
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

49:02.148 --> 49:04.309
- Varinius.
- Yeah!

49:04.483 --> 49:08.317
I owe you a debt of blood,
for Acer and Rhaskos.

49:08.487 --> 49:10.728
And we shall see it paid

49:10.906 --> 49:12.521
after answer is given.

49:13.784 --> 49:14.990
Where is Glaber?

49:15.161 --> 49:17.026
- ( catapult releases )
- Spartacus.

49:30.050 --> 49:31.335
Fuck!

49:31.510 --> 49:33.501
(yelling)

49:58.746 --> 50:01.032
(yelling orders)

50:01.207 --> 50:02.868
Pull!

50:03.042 --> 50:04.282
lgnite!

50:04.460 --> 50:05.950
Push!

50:09.423 --> 50:11.630
On the ready!

50:11.800 --> 50:13.131
Ready!

50:13.302 --> 50:15.338
On my signal!

50:15.513 --> 50:17.049
Load!

50:17.223 --> 50:18.929
- Ignite!
- Release!

50:21.685 --> 50:23.425
Again!

50:23.604 --> 50:25.140
- ( yelling )
- We have to move!

50:50.005 --> 50:51.120
( groans )

51:53.485 --> 51:55.441
Fall back! Into the tunnel!

51:59.408 --> 52:01.069
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

52:05.456 --> 52:06.741
Crixus!

52:08.083 --> 52:10.950
Go! We'll follow!

52:23.223 --> 52:24.633
Oenomaus!

52:27.895 --> 52:30.386
(screaming )

52:40.032 --> 52:42.899
Move! Move!

52:46.455 --> 52:47.661
Agron!

52:56.131 --> 52:57.166
Move! Go!

53:13.315 --> 53:15.055
- Move!
- Go!

53:15.234 --> 53:16.349
Move!

53:25.411 --> 53:26.742
Go! Come on!

53:26.912 --> 53:28.152
Quickly!

53:30.499 --> 53:33.991
- Move!
- Keep moving!

53:34.169 --> 53:36.706
(woman screams )

53:40.259 --> 53:41.965
( rebels screaming )

53:42.136 --> 53:44.627
No. There are too many of them.

53:44.805 --> 53:47.672
The mountain pass! Hurry!

53:47.850 --> 53:50.683
But there is no other path down.
We'll be trapped.

53:50.853 --> 53:52.184
There's no choice!

53:52.354 --> 53:54.345
We must move! Go!

53:54.523 --> 53:56.354
( marching )

53:59.987 --> 54:01.477
Crixus: Spartacus.

54:07.536 --> 54:09.492
Go! Move!

54:09.663 --> 54:12.075
This way! This way!

54:17.004 --> 54:18.995
(wind blowing)

54:23.886 --> 54:26.127
Is there no other way
to gain the mountain?

54:26.305 --> 54:29.547
None, save for the narrow path
they escaped upon.

54:29.725 --> 54:32.558
Scores of men were lost
in attempted pursuit.

54:32.728 --> 54:35.390
Foolish endeavor.

54:35.564 --> 54:37.179
They now hold the high ground.

54:37.357 --> 54:38.688
We've lost advantage.

54:38.859 --> 54:40.850
You would let them go free?

54:41.028 --> 54:42.768
No.

54:42.946 --> 54:45.198
I would let them feast...

54:46.366 --> 54:49.199
on mud and rock.

54:50.746 --> 54:54.489
And when hunger and madness
drive them from their perch...

54:56.084 --> 54:58.700
we shall kill them all.

55:00.714 --> 55:02.705
