<i>Some people swear there's
no beauty left in the world. No magic.</i>

01:01.560 --> 01:05.770
<i>Then how do you explain the entire world
coming together on one night...</i>

01:05.960 --> 01:09.726
<i>...to celebrate the hope of a new year?</i>

01:15.360 --> 01:16.407
Ready.

01:16.560 --> 01:17.686
Pull!

01:17.840 --> 01:21.367
Ease it off. Ease it. Gently.

01:21.880 --> 01:26.920
Well done, boys. We'll pack up the tarp.
Looks like it's gonna be a beautiful day.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.208
Hello, Your Majesty. Ha-ha-ha.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.250
<i>We wanna see a show of strength...</i>

01:31.440 --> 01:33.169
<i>...from the
New York City Police Department.</i>

01:40.480 --> 01:44.166
<i>Good morning,
this is Ryan Seacrest here in New York...</i>

01:44.320 --> 01:49.247
<i>...where the crowds of revelers are already
beginning to arrive in Times Square.</i>

01:49.400 --> 01:52.210
<i>I'll be coming at you all day on radio...</i>

01:52.360 --> 01:58.402
<i>...and all night live from the center
of it all, so bundle up and stay tuned.</i>

02:07.560 --> 02:11.406
Good morning, Claire!
They need you up here for an interview.

02:12.960 --> 02:16.009
This is Claire Morgan. She's in charge.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.082
Mind giving us a sound bite
for the newscast?

02:21.280 --> 02:22.850
No, I'd be happy to.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.324
I'm talking to Claire Morgan, the new vice
president of the Times Square Alliance.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.891
So big night.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.082
Well, I'd say that's an understatement.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.926
Over a billion people all over the world
will have their eyes on us tonight...

02:35.080 --> 02:40.405
...as the ball drops, so I'd say that
qualifies as a very big night.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.163
Am I looking in the right spot
for camera?

02:43.640 --> 02:45.130
Oh, um...

02:45.320 --> 02:46.367
We're radio.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.841
Right. Of course.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.164
This is 14th and Park.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.050
Oh! Oh! Uhh.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.806
Are you all right, lady? Are you all right?

03:11.480 --> 03:12.527
Here.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.126
No, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. Go away.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.008
Yeah, what's up, girls? How you doing?
All right?

03:37.480 --> 03:39.448
Yo, I see you, player. Ha.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.484
Oh, oh, hey, Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.051
Yeah, you too.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.601
Sign this, but you can't check in
until tonight.

03:51.760 --> 03:53.524
No problem. We'll be back tonight.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.206
- We're gonna win the money.
- Oh, of course you are.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.521
What money?

03:57.680 --> 04:01.924
Oh, the first baby delivered in the new
year at this hospital gets 25 grand.

04:02.080 --> 04:04.811
No, no, no, honey.
I think it's much less than that.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.804
- No, it's 25 grand.
- Twenty-five grand?

04:07.960 --> 04:11.282
Honey, you're mistaken. It's much less.

04:11.440 --> 04:16.002
Plus, after taxes and all the red tape,
you end up with no money.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.767
Did I mention the news cameras
in your face right after giving birth?

04:19.920 --> 04:22.127
That's horrible. It's not worth it at all.

04:22.320 --> 04:26.166
It's 25 grand. They could put the camera
in my hoo-ha and it'd be worth it.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.401
In your hoo-ha!

04:27.560 --> 04:29.483
In my hoo-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

04:29.640 --> 04:30.801
Mr. and Mrs. Byrne?

04:30.960 --> 04:32.371
- That's us.
- Right this way.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.531
Come on, Grace. Let's go home.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.040
Hmm.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.568
Okay. Let's figure out how to induce.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.161
- I will ask the Internet right now.
- By command.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.243
This could pay off my student loan.

04:58.880 --> 05:02.601
Okay, honey, the hallway looks great.
Very festive.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.081
This could be a little higher.
Hand me that tape.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.762
Here you go. It looks beautiful.
You did a nice job.

05:08.920 --> 05:12.606
Why you volunteered to decorate the floor
I'll never know, but it looks great.

05:12.760 --> 05:13.807
Oh, hush up.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.729
Come on, we gotta get dressed for work.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.928
- Let's call in sick.
- Mm.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.163
- Hey, Paul.
- My dog.

05:29.320 --> 05:31.368
- What are we doing tonight?
- You're working.

05:31.520 --> 05:32.965
I'm not. So leave me alone.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.841
Randy, listen to me, don't do this
right now. Don't go into your black hole.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.571
It's midnight on New Year's Eve.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.529
<i>We have to do something.
Not an option.</i>

05:41.680 --> 05:45.844
<i>What, are you still on this anti-New Year's
kick, bro? Get over yourself. Now.</i>

05:46.000 --> 05:50.722
You know what? It's not a kick.
It's a core tenet of my being.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.882
Like I said, I get the day off...

05:54.080 --> 05:58.802
...so I'm gonna hang in our apartment
by myself and do nothing, and love it.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.689
It's my job as your best friend
to just ignore you right now...

06:02.880 --> 06:04.848
...because you sound crazy.

06:05.160 --> 06:08.721
I'm not being crazy!

06:09.600 --> 06:14.731
Okay, I'm gonna find something so epic
that you will not be able to say no.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.844
Hmm.

06:18.040 --> 06:21.726
I got a funny feeling, Paul,
that I'm gonna say no.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.726
You want to throw the challenge flag
in my face? Okay. I'll call you back.

06:25.880 --> 06:26.927
Save your minutes.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.646
Now we're talking.

06:32.480 --> 06:35.484
By the power vested in me
by the state of Connecticut...

06:35.640 --> 06:40.601
...Rory and Trish,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.331
You may give kisses to the missus.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.650
My cousin will pay you.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.730
Oh. Congratulations to both of you.
That was just beautiful.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.485
Thank you all for coming.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.845
We wanted to save money
for the honeymoon.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.570
Well, you're the last of us, Sam.

07:03.720 --> 07:07.725
Roam the plains of Manhattan and carry on
the legacy of late-night barhopping...

07:07.880 --> 07:10.724
...and casual sex with random women
in good shoes.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.611
- Which Rory will never know again.
- Mm.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.962
For better or worse, I can see why
the man's crazy about you.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.565
Aww.

07:21.680 --> 07:22.727
I'm out of here.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.082
- You can't stay for breakfast?
- Rain check.

07:25.240 --> 07:28.050
Office has been calling all morning.
I really gotta get back.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.885
- I got that big speech tonight.
- What about the girl?

07:31.040 --> 07:33.281
- What girl?
- The one you met last New Year's Eve?

07:33.440 --> 07:36.649
- Are you gonna meet her tonight?
- It was a year ago. We've moved on.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.086
Hey, look at you two.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.611
All married.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.005
- Here they come!
- Congratulations!

07:44.160 --> 07:45.605
No, no, no. These two. Here.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.569
- All right. I'll see you.
- Bye, Sam.

07:47.720 --> 07:50.326
Hey, there's someone out there
for you too, buddy.

07:50.480 --> 07:51.891
All right.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.447
Okay.

08:07.680 --> 08:11.048
All right. Our first event
with linen napkins.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.410
Not only are we now eco-friendly, but this
will be our biggest A-list party to date.

08:15.560 --> 08:19.406
I know it's cold, okay? But we cannot
mess this up. So you gotta focus.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.285
- Where is Ava?
- She thinks she saw a celebrity somewhere.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.801
There's gonna be more celebrities
here than rehab.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.282
Okay, Sunil, make sure we have
all the booze on this list.

08:28.480 --> 08:31.927
Find Ava and then I'll meet you
in the lobby after I scout the kitchen.

08:32.440 --> 08:35.091
Ava!
- Take a picture with the bus.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.328
- I'm freaking out.
- Ava, there is no time for freaking out.

08:38.480 --> 08:43.202
I can't help it. Do you see that bus?
I saw it when I went to his concert.

08:43.360 --> 08:44.486
It's Jensen!

08:44.640 --> 08:45.846
That's Jensen's bus?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.130
The Jensen?

08:48.600 --> 08:49.726
That's fantastic.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.610
- I love it.
- Aah!

08:54.280 --> 08:55.281
- Ohh!
- Yee!

08:55.440 --> 08:56.726
Keep jumping!

08:56.880 --> 08:58.803
You are very sexy, but don't stop.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.281
Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy!

09:04.360 --> 09:07.967
<i>Now don't be sad</i>

09:10.200 --> 09:14.330
<i>'Cause two out of three ain't bad.</i>

09:14.480 --> 09:16.608
<i>Jensen! Jensen! Jensen!</i>

09:20.720 --> 09:23.246
You know, I know him personally.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.323
Everybody, let's get as much prep
done in the kitchen as possible.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.563
And any sauces that need to get done
can start now.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.961
And I'll check the deliveries
up in the lobby. Oh.

09:33.120 --> 09:37.250
Anyone who can, can you please help Sunil
and Ava unload the truck? That'd be great.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.403
<i>Ay-ay-ay. Laura.
You're not going to believe who is here.</i>

09:43.600 --> 09:44.647
Jensen.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.168
<i>How did you know? Are you psychotic?</i>

09:48.560 --> 09:51.211
It's "psychic." And do me a favor.
If you see him...

09:51.400 --> 09:55.564
...tell him to avoid the blond in
the kitchen with the really big knife.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.007
<i>Ay, Laura, do you know him?</i>

09:59.760 --> 10:01.842
It's good to see you, Laura.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.526
<i>Are you still there?</i>

10:13.680 --> 10:17.924
<i>Do you think Jensen will sign a banana?
I don't have any paper.</i>

10:22.760 --> 10:25.764
All right. Working on those
resolutions, huh?

10:25.920 --> 10:28.571
- No.
- Okay.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.042
I have a delivery here
for Mr. Jonathan Cox.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.611
Do you work here?

10:33.760 --> 10:35.762
No. I work for a courier service.

10:35.920 --> 10:39.402
I've been delivering packages to you
for about, I don't know, a year now.

10:39.560 --> 10:43.167
But I think this is maybe the first time
you've ever looked me in the eye.

10:43.320 --> 10:44.560
How you doing?

10:45.920 --> 10:46.967
Sorry.

10:47.160 --> 10:50.243
That's actually an old resolution.
Make more eye contact.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.568
So those were New Year's
resolutions, huh?

10:53.720 --> 10:55.848
Looks like a long list.
You better get on it.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.241
I don't know, maybe next year.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.290
Whoa. Jeez! Are you serious?

11:03.840 --> 11:06.081
That is a hot ticket.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.131
- Really?
- It's amazing.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.642
They have the best food, the best music.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.609
They got so many single girls.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.447
And it's a masquerade, so you don't even
have to worry about their faces.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.807
You kind of just use your imagination.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.930
If anybody tries to kick you out,
or even asks who you are...

11:23.080 --> 11:25.606
...you just straight-up lie.
What are they gonna do?

11:25.760 --> 11:26.921
It's brilliant.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.600
It's like Facebook, but real.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.730
I remember who you are now.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.245
Right, exactly.

11:33.520 --> 11:36.285
Anyways, I would give my left...

11:39.800 --> 11:41.768
Well, maybe next year.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.563
Oh, there she is.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.843
- You ready?
- Let's go talk to them.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.526
- Hey, Hailey. You good?
- Yeah, we're good, Seth.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.409
All right. Well, let's go, fellas.

12:05.560 --> 12:09.121
We need to scout our pen on 54th
and head home to gear up for tonight.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.726
- I'm gonna see you there, right?
- Yeah, definitely.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.565
- Well, I'll see you there.
- See you.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.648
- Ooh.
- You are so gonna kiss Seth tonight!

12:17.840 --> 12:22.129
I really just, like, haven't even thought
about it at all. It's no big deal.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.486
Do you know how to kiss?

12:23.640 --> 12:25.927
They have a video on the Internet
that shows you.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.687
Two. One for regular kissing,
and one for passionate kissing.

12:29.840 --> 12:34.562
All right, guys. Yeah, I know how to kiss, so it's fine.
It's not a big deal. Okay, we...

12:34.720 --> 12:37.803
Hey, what about your mom?
What's she doing?

12:38.960 --> 12:40.450
Got it!

12:40.600 --> 12:45.367
Oh, and remember, it's just a quarter of an
inch at the center back of the collar, okay?

12:45.520 --> 12:47.249
Okay, let me take a look at that.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.129
Kim, is that your New Year's dress?

12:49.280 --> 12:53.683
Oh, it's just something I'm working on
for a rainy day.

12:53.840 --> 12:57.049
You should wear it tonight.
Maybe you'll scare up a little action.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.406
That's highly doubtful.

12:58.560 --> 13:02.485
The only action I've got is Hailey and me
watching the ball drop at midnight.

13:02.640 --> 13:06.042
Last New Year's Eve she was
with her father. So it's my turn.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.603
- Wanna join us?
- Wow, really tempting.

13:09.760 --> 13:12.809
I don't think you understand.
Hailey likes staying in with me.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.325
All dancers on-stage!
- Go.

13:14.520 --> 13:17.251
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:17.440 --> 13:18.805
Five, six, seven, eight.

13:39.720 --> 13:42.121
<i>- New York.</i>
<i>- New Rochelle.</i>

13:42.320 --> 13:44.368
<i>- New Brunswick.</i>
- New York... New York City.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.567
<i>New Haven.</i>

13:45.760 --> 13:47.091
<i>New Britain.</i>

13:48.040 --> 13:49.405
<i>New Hartford.</i>

13:50.040 --> 13:51.087
<i>New Jersey?</i>

13:51.440 --> 13:52.930
New York!

13:53.080 --> 13:54.764
<i>New York. Turn right.</i>

13:54.920 --> 13:56.843
<i>Left for New York.</i>

14:02.440 --> 14:03.885
Oh! Oh.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.280
Oh, my nose.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.930
<i>Airbags deployed.</i>

14:07.600 --> 14:08.931
<i>The genny truck's not arrived yet.</i>

14:09.080 --> 14:11.731
Will someone tell me why it isn't here yet?

14:11.880 --> 14:14.247
Make sure Jensen's on schedule
for his soundcheck.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.767
He's playing some party,
but this is Times Square.

14:16.920 --> 14:18.285
She's a little on edge today.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.204
<i>Ready for the confetti test.</i>

14:20.360 --> 14:22.010
Brendan.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.331
Good to see you.
I thought you were with your family.

14:25.480 --> 14:29.371
I was, then I realized you wouldn't make it
through the big night without me.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.249
- Wow, I'm really touched.
- Heh.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.801
I'm trying not to say this,
but if I screw up...

14:33.960 --> 14:37.931
- You won't.
- I don't know. I'm not off to a great start.

14:38.160 --> 14:39.491
The generator truck is late.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.883
I mugged for the camera during
a radio interview. Can you believe it?

14:43.040 --> 14:44.963
You'll make it happen.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.327
And you'll make it on time
for your meeting.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.286
- We're not talking about my meeting.
- And why not?

14:50.440 --> 14:52.761
I should've never told you about that.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.729
Look. Come here, lookit.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.801
They're testing the confetti for tonight.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.608
Don't just dump them!

15:03.400 --> 15:05.767
Float them in the wind.
It should be magical.

15:10.640 --> 15:11.846
I'm so glad you're here.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.366
Laura, I know you're upset. All right?

15:20.560 --> 15:23.291
- Mr. Jensen, I play piano.
- I just play.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.005
Thank you, thank you.

15:25.880 --> 15:29.680
- Laura, it's been a year already.
- I have nothing to say to you, Daniel.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.491
- "Daniel."
- She knows Mr. Jensen.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.451
Hello, secrets.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.841
Look at me. Just look at me.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.163
- That was quite a slap.
- I've been plotting that slap all year.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.966
How I would walk up to you
when you least expect it...

15:46.120 --> 15:49.124
...and slap you across the face
for leaving me like that.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.606
And you know what?

15:52.400 --> 15:55.131
It wasn't nearly as satisfying
as I thought it would be.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.723
- Aah!
- Ooh.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.850
- That was closer.
- We're just fooling around.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.202
- I like fooling around too.
- Come back.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.528
I tried to call you.
You never called me back.

16:06.680 --> 16:09.490
I left you tickets, you never showed up.
Talk to me, damn it.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.007
- Just talk to me.
- Just talk to him.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.845
Because it's New Year's Eve,
you want another shot at it?

16:15.440 --> 16:18.649
You walked out on me, Daniel.
I think that says it all.

16:18.800 --> 16:22.088
I didn't even get to make you
one dinner in that apartment.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.084
You walked out before I unpacked
the first bag of groceries.

16:28.200 --> 16:31.522
Celebrities. They're just like us.

16:33.760 --> 16:37.890
Mr. Cox? Is there a reason
you asked me to work today?

16:38.640 --> 16:40.802
- It's your job.
- Of course.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.042
It's just that it's New Year's Eve...

16:43.200 --> 16:47.524
...and I thought maybe you wanted
to give me my end-of-year bonus.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.408
- Seeing that it's the end of the year.
- Oh.

16:50.680 --> 16:53.286
Right. Almost slipped my mind. Mm.

16:54.760 --> 16:57.445
- Glad to remind you, sir.
- Well, unfortunately...

16:57.600 --> 16:59.887
...it has been a tough year
for Ahern Records.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.491
I don't have to tell you.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.963
Music piracy, blah, blah, blah.

17:08.599 --> 17:10.284
Have I got your name right?

17:11.160 --> 17:16.290
Yes, it's just that I wanted to use
my bonus to book a trip.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.965
Well, that might get you to Staten Island.

17:19.119 --> 17:20.246
Maybe next year.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.210
It's just that I already booked
my two weeks' vacation time.

17:23.359 --> 17:25.169
Two weeks? Did I sign off?

17:26.960 --> 17:29.611
You don't need to, sir.
It goes through Human Resources.

17:29.760 --> 17:33.207
No, it goes through me. And I can't do
without you for two weeks.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.561
You can have one week.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.163
Well, then...

17:41.160 --> 17:42.321
...I'll take two weeks...

17:43.200 --> 17:44.884
...and my stapler.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.800
I quit.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.804
You can't quit, it's Grammy season!

17:50.560 --> 17:52.050
I...

17:52.480 --> 17:53.720
I almost died today, sir.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.207
No, no. You look fine.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.249
Can you get me a coffee?

18:03.400 --> 18:04.731
Don't forget the sugar!

18:04.880 --> 18:07.611
Come on, three stars! I need three stars!

18:13.480 --> 18:15.608
Jonathan Cox's office. Please hold.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.927
- Look out!
- Oh, God. No, don't.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.122
I have hated him for leaving me like that.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.521
- No, don't do the egg.
- Then he just shows up...

18:26.680 --> 18:30.685
...on the biggest night of my career!
What kind of karma is that? Huh?

18:30.840 --> 18:32.683
What, that you made love with Jensen...

18:32.880 --> 18:35.486
...or that you're catering
the biggest party in the city?

18:35.640 --> 18:37.404
Because all I'm hearing is good.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.730
- Can I do one?
- Yeah.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.326
- The expensive eggs?
- They feel good.

18:43.640 --> 18:44.687
Oh.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.366
Oh, that was so sissy.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.207
I'm delicate girl.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.442
<i>Dr. Trokin to Radiation Therapy.</i>

18:53.800 --> 18:55.882
<i>Dr. Trokin to Radiation Therapy.</i>

18:56.440 --> 18:59.523
- Hey, doc.
- Yes, Mr. Harris.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.882
I haven't asked you for anything, have I?

19:02.840 --> 19:04.888
No. No, you haven't.

19:05.680 --> 19:07.603
No chemo...

19:07.840 --> 19:12.004
...no radiation, nothing that could
give you an extra couple of months.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.651
So then you owe me one.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.968
Sure, Mr. Harris. What do you need?

19:17.640 --> 19:20.405
Did I tell you why I picked this hospital?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.961
Because of the quality of the doctors?

19:23.800 --> 19:27.600
The roof has a great view of the New
Year's Eve ball drop in Times Square.

19:28.760 --> 19:31.730
I heard you say
I was living on borrowed time.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.450
I don't recall telling you that.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.523
I heard you tell the nurses.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.364
I'm dying, I'm not deaf.

19:38.960 --> 19:41.327
Well, you've certainly surprised us,
Mr. Harris.

19:42.600 --> 19:46.571
But be honest, there really isn't anyone
we can notify? No one at all?

19:46.720 --> 19:51.089
The only people who ever cared about me,
I pissed off long ago. There's no one.

19:52.160 --> 19:53.491
Doc, come on.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.604
Call it a dying man's last wish.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.722
Please, come on. I've been hanging on this
long just so I can see the ball drop...

20:02.480 --> 20:04.130
...one more time.

20:05.640 --> 20:08.371
- You know, it's cold out there.
- I'll live.

20:09.600 --> 20:13.924
- You can see it much better on TV.
- I don't wanna see it on TV, doc, please.

20:14.080 --> 20:19.120
As much as I'd like to help you, it's against
hospital policy to allow anyone on the roof.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.721
Just forget it. Forget I asked.

20:22.080 --> 20:25.402
- Okay. If there's anything else you need...
- No, nothing.

20:25.560 --> 20:28.325
- ...just have the nurses page me, okay?
- Yeah.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.130
Okay.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.961
See if you can get him to eat something.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.645
Did he change his mind?

20:36.800 --> 20:40.646
Nope. No treatment,
just palliative meds at this point.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.810
- I guess it's time for hospice.
- No time.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.767
Well, is he gonna make it
until tomorrow?

20:46.920 --> 20:48.001
It's doubtful.

20:55.640 --> 21:00.123
Another thing that chaps my ass about the
holiday season is all the fake niceness.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.449
Like, today I received 50 text messages...

21:03.600 --> 21:05.887
...with a generic "Happy New Year"...

21:06.040 --> 21:08.566
...from people who hit "send"
to their address book.

21:08.720 --> 21:12.850
Most of them I haven't heard from
since last year. Call me back.

21:15.080 --> 21:17.208
Oh, hey, hold the elevator.

21:17.480 --> 21:19.687
- I'm going down.
- Oh, wait, wait.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.882
- Honestly...
- Me too.

21:23.280 --> 21:26.204
Yeah, I tore down the decorations.

21:27.120 --> 21:31.205
According to the lease agreement, you're
not supposed to decorate the hallways.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.202
Not my decorations.

21:53.040 --> 21:56.044
- Yep.
- No, no, no. This can't be happening.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.248
I have somewhere that I need to be.

21:59.520 --> 22:02.729
Hello? Hello? Hello?

22:02.920 --> 22:05.048
- Wait, this thing is dead!
- It doesn't work.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.089
Well, call the super.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.571
He doesn't work either.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.371
- No reception.
- Oh, no.

22:10.520 --> 22:12.921
Oh, you're the new girl from 5B.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.687
Why aren't you more panicked
right now?

22:16.840 --> 22:19.889
Oh, I don't know. I don't really
have anywhere to be.

22:21.040 --> 22:25.011
Hello? Hello, this is 5B! This is 5B!

22:25.160 --> 22:27.003
I'm stuck in this elevator!

22:27.160 --> 22:28.969
I'm gonna be late for work.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.764
False alarm, dear ones.

22:33.920 --> 22:37.163
- But everything's okay, right?
- Oh, everything looks very good.

22:40.840 --> 22:42.649
Hmm...

22:43.120 --> 22:47.250
We close both eyes so that
we may see through the other.

22:47.960 --> 22:48.961
<i>Close them.</i>

22:49.120 --> 22:50.167
No.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.683
Hmm.
Labor could be any day now.

22:58.280 --> 22:59.361
Any day?

22:59.640 --> 23:03.042
Don't worry, I know you wanna have
a very natural childbirth...

23:03.200 --> 23:06.727
...no epidural, no pitocin, we're gonna
use the hypnobirthing techniques.

23:06.880 --> 23:10.885
We were actually just kind of wondering
if we could schedule a C-section.

23:11.040 --> 23:14.123
Just, you know, kind of get this show
on the road, am I right?

23:14.280 --> 23:16.328
- Yeah.
- Uh, we were thinking, um...

23:16.600 --> 23:18.602
...maybe tonight-ish.

23:18.760 --> 23:21.127
Midnight-ish. Uh...

23:21.280 --> 23:22.566
- Right? Griff, right?
- Yeah.

23:22.720 --> 23:25.451
We were both thinking that
maybe tonight could work better.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.888
- If we could do tonight that would be great.
- Tonight?

23:29.160 --> 23:30.571
Hmm.

23:31.200 --> 23:36.445
You want me to come in on New Year's Eve
at midnight and perform a C-section?

23:37.640 --> 23:38.721
Is it New Year's?

23:38.880 --> 23:41.486
- Oh, boy. Weird.
- It is. Yeah.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.768
- I completely just forgot.
- I did too.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.888
- I think with all this.
- Pregnancy brain.

23:46.040 --> 23:49.487
We were never really New Year's people.
We're more Memorial Day people.

23:49.640 --> 23:51.369
Let me be clear.

23:52.080 --> 23:56.369
I will not schedule a C-section
just so you can win some money.

23:56.520 --> 24:00.002
The couple who was in here before
offered to split the winnings with me.

24:00.160 --> 24:02.083
And of course I said no.

24:02.320 --> 24:05.688
Frankly, I'm surprised that you would
even suggest this, Tess.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.841
What if we went 60-40?

24:11.920 --> 24:13.081
- Seventy-thirty.
- Yeah.

24:13.560 --> 24:16.245
You are dangerously close
to a rectal exam.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.890
Oh, that's not good.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.691
Mom, I wanna go to Times Square
to watch the ball drop.

24:21.840 --> 24:26.562
Well, I plan to avoid this entire section
of the city tonight.

24:26.720 --> 24:29.166
Well, I don't want you to stay.
I want you to go home.

24:30.280 --> 24:32.521
- Ouch.
- There's this guy in my history class.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.887
His name is Seth, and I've been hoping...

24:35.040 --> 24:38.886
I have this, like, sick dream that, you
know, we'll get to hang out at midnight.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.048
And then, of course,
I'll come right home.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.166
Honey, I'm sorry.

24:43.320 --> 24:48.406
I'm just... I'm not comfortable allowing you
to stay in Times Square at night alone.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.682
- Period.
- End of discussion, got it.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.882
Sorry. Come on.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.961
- You know, I'm 15!
- I know, Hailey.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.531
This is not a training bra!

24:58.720 --> 25:01.200
And this is not <i>Girls Gone Wild!</i>

25:01.360 --> 25:02.407
MY gosh.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.568
Mom, you know,
I'm an honors student, okay?

25:04.720 --> 25:08.725
I don't drink or do drugs, and I'm trying
really hard to be the perfect daughter.

25:08.880 --> 25:11.963
- But it's like you don't trust me.
- No, it's not you I don't trust.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.964
Then who do you not trust, Mom?
You don't trust the world?

25:15.120 --> 25:17.646
Or is it just New York
because it's a big scary city?

25:17.800 --> 25:19.245
Have you ever been to Newark?

25:21.280 --> 25:24.648
Look, Mom, the world doesn't scare me,
okay? It's just getting good.

25:24.800 --> 25:26.723
I wanna start living in it.

25:27.160 --> 25:28.491
You used to.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.085
<i>Brady Finley in Times Square.</i>

25:34.240 --> 25:38.165
<i>It's before noon and they're already
predicting record-breaking crowds.</i>

25:38.320 --> 25:41.802
I'm with Miss Morgan.
We're bringing the media to the roof.

25:43.920 --> 25:45.410
Hey. You okay?

25:46.520 --> 25:48.727
- Fine.
- You're not afraid of heights, are you?

25:49.480 --> 25:50.970
- A little.
- Let me be accurate.

25:51.120 --> 25:53.771
You're afraid of heights
and you run the ball drop?

25:54.560 --> 25:57.291
Well, I think it's what makes Claire
the best for this job.

25:57.760 --> 26:01.128
- Let's do that thing we worked out.
- Yeah, let's do that.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.850
- Officer Nolan.
- Yes, sir.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.890
Be careful here.
This is precious cargo, all right?

26:06.440 --> 26:07.885
Make a hole, people.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.208
- Oh.
- Oh, are we all getting picked up?

26:13.360 --> 26:14.964
- Sure.
- No, no, no.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.043
No, no, no.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.564
Okay.

26:19.880 --> 26:22.087
I'm okay. Ha-ha.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.083
Okay. Where were we?

26:24.240 --> 26:25.605
Uh... Oh, the ball.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.531
Since 1907 there's been
a Times Square ball drop.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.921
The first ball was made
of wood and iron...

26:32.080 --> 26:35.482
...and had only 100 25-watt light bulbs.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.605
Okay. Let's light this baby up.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.361
Ready?

26:42.160 --> 26:43.366
- Oh.
- Hey!

26:44.160 --> 26:45.844
- It worked!
- Beautiful.

26:46.680 --> 26:50.765
Okay, so this evening we are gonna raise
this ball to the very top of the pole...

26:50.960 --> 26:54.009
...where it will stay until 11:59.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.527
And then the countdown begins.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.884
Can you fix it?
- No. And don't you want to know why?

27:01.040 --> 27:04.806
Because the complicated machine
behind me isn't called a fix truck.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.041
It's called a tow truck.

27:06.200 --> 27:09.966
That means I put the big hook under the
broken car and take it anywhere you want.

27:10.120 --> 27:11.929
- Which is where?
- New York City.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.491
No again.

27:13.640 --> 27:16.883
Not today and not me. I've got big plans
with my lady friend tonight.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.644
Sign there.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.406
Can you at least tow it
to a mechanic nearby, please?

27:21.560 --> 27:24.006
Nearest mechanic is 10 minutes away.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.487
- Whatever, that's perfect.
- Let me finish.

27:26.640 --> 27:30.167
He's 10 minutes away, but he's closed
today. Everyone's closed today.

27:30.320 --> 27:32.800
I guess you know since you're
dressed like Penn & Teller.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.367
As far as the car goes, you're SOL...

27:35.520 --> 27:38.364
...which means "something out of luck,"
but I don't curse.

27:38.520 --> 27:42.570
I can't be SOL. I've got a big speech
at the company party tonight, okay?

27:42.760 --> 27:43.841
This is very important.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.207
- I've got something important too.
- Like what?

27:46.840 --> 27:49.844
Me and my girl are gonna crush
a 12-pack and watch porn.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.126
- Ms. Withers?
- Oh.

28:00.520 --> 28:02.602
Did you call in a delivery of something?

28:02.760 --> 28:04.922
- Ingrid.
- Ingrid.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.487
And actually...

28:08.560 --> 28:09.925
...I'm your next job.

28:10.360 --> 28:11.566
I bought you for the day.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.165
Bought me for the day, huh?

28:13.320 --> 28:17.211
Oh, Ms. Withers. I think I should be
offended, but I'm just too intrigued.

28:17.360 --> 28:18.805
My New Year's resolutions.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.411
Mm-hm.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.248
I just took care of the first one.

28:24.760 --> 28:26.489
You quit your job?

28:28.280 --> 28:31.841
- All right.
- If you make these come true by midnight...

28:35.000 --> 28:36.126
...you get these.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.647
For me?

28:40.960 --> 28:42.530
Holy sh...

28:42.680 --> 28:46.401
Whoa. Whoa, okay. Put these down.
Don't flash those around.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.528
Everybody can see them. Seriously.

28:48.960 --> 28:52.328
You called the right guy.
I'm in. Let me see number two.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.450
What is it? Whew.

28:56.240 --> 28:59.642
"Go to Bali. Breakfast at Tiffany's."

28:59.840 --> 29:01.126
You wanna save a life.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.127
Are you kidding me?

29:04.280 --> 29:07.090
Impossible. I don't understand
what you're talking about.

29:07.240 --> 29:09.925
I don't understand what
you want me to do here.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.321
Use your imagination.

29:17.560 --> 29:19.847
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.200
You know, you don't have to sit like that.

29:25.360 --> 29:28.330
You can put your legs around me,
or you can hold onto me.

29:28.480 --> 29:30.289
No, I'm okay.

29:30.760 --> 29:31.807
All right.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.201
<i>Señor</i> Jensen, I'm here.

29:36.960 --> 29:40.521
And I brought you some enchiladas.
They're very spicy.

29:40.680 --> 29:41.886
Thank you.

29:42.040 --> 29:44.520
Listen, Ava, I was hoping maybe
you could help me out.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.842
What is it? Is it writer's block?

29:47.000 --> 29:49.844
Because if it is, I've been jotting
down these lyrics.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.651
They're in Spanish now,
but I can translate them.

29:52.800 --> 29:56.168
Come, come. Come here.
No, not like that. Really. Just...

29:57.280 --> 29:59.726
Help me convince Laura
that I made a mistake.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.531
- When?
- It was last New Year's Eve.

30:02.680 --> 30:04.284
What did you do to her?

30:04.440 --> 30:06.249
Nothing. I asked her to marry me.

30:06.520 --> 30:07.601
That's beautiful.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.047
But then I got cold feet.
I wasn't ready for it.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.810
That's horrible.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.042
You were the one who proposed.

30:14.200 --> 30:17.124
In my country when a man
gets down on one knee...

30:17.280 --> 30:20.204
...it's because he wants to get married
or he's been shot.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.367
Sometimes it's been because of both.

30:24.720 --> 30:28.406
No, no. It's just that it all came at me
too fast and I wasn't ready for it.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.723
I had to go back on the road,
and I just didn't wanna deal with it.

30:31.880 --> 30:35.646
You should have talked to her.
That's what women like. We like to talk.

30:35.800 --> 30:39.088
I tried. I just can't get a word in
edgewise between slaps.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.083
Do you want to know what I think?

30:42.240 --> 30:43.446
Well, I sure would.

30:45.320 --> 30:48.324
Ay. Hi, Laura.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.930
This is not what it looks like. No.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.121
- No?
- No.

30:54.280 --> 30:58.888
It's not my ex-boyfriend telling our
whole sad saga to my new sous-chef?

30:59.080 --> 31:01.003
Yeah, pretty much that's what it is.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.083
Uh-huh.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.285
- Be strong.
- Mm.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.841
- Hold your ground.
- Yes.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.449
But don't look into his eyes because
they're beautiful. He has, like, a blue...

31:13.360 --> 31:14.725
Bye.

31:17.400 --> 31:18.561
Truce?

31:20.680 --> 31:21.727
Truce.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.290
Breakfast at Tiffany's.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.041
Done.

31:30.240 --> 31:32.242
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

31:34.720 --> 31:37.326
<i>Take a New York taxi ride with no traffic.</i>

31:37.480 --> 31:38.811
<i>Done.</i>

31:39.680 --> 31:41.205
Did you hear the new record?

31:41.360 --> 31:42.964
No.

31:46.480 --> 31:47.891
Yeah.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.651
What'd you think?

31:49.840 --> 31:53.208
Ugh. You know, I wanted to hate it.
I really did. But I loved it.

31:53.720 --> 31:55.131
I thought it was great.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.762
Except for the picture you chose
for the cover.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.084
It was a little too much bronzer.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.766
Well, as always, I could've used your help.

32:07.040 --> 32:10.408
I'm a little overwhelmed and frazzled
by this job tonight...

32:10.560 --> 32:12.449
...so I apologize for slapping you.

32:12.600 --> 32:13.726
The second time.

32:17.240 --> 32:19.402
I'm sorry I ran, Laura.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.329
Oh, Daniel.

32:22.680 --> 32:24.523
You sprinted.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.247
I mean...

32:27.600 --> 32:28.681
Laura, can I see you?

32:28.880 --> 32:31.121
I gotta get back to work,
focus on tonight.

32:31.280 --> 32:32.725
What about tomorrow?

32:32.880 --> 32:35.804
We're going back on tour
and I'd love it if you'd come with me.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.727
We could fix this.

32:38.880 --> 32:41.690
Yeah, sure. I'll go pack a bag.
Meet you at the bus?

32:43.040 --> 32:44.166
Come on.

32:44.320 --> 32:48.006
I can't go back on tour with you.
I did your life. I have a life too.

32:48.360 --> 32:50.567
You really don't get it, do you?

32:52.240 --> 32:53.730
What's there to get?

32:54.040 --> 32:55.724
I'm ready to commit.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.489
I'm ready.

32:58.640 --> 33:01.041
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.567
I'm ready to commit to what I really love:

33:03.720 --> 33:05.210
My work.

33:05.800 --> 33:08.280
I can't do this again with you, Daniel.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.003
Nope. Still no reception.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.250
So how can you have nowhere to be?

33:21.400 --> 33:25.644
Isn't it obvious? New Year's is the worst
night to go out. It's total amateur night.

33:25.800 --> 33:29.930
People who don't drink or go nuts all year
suddenly going all Kanye on you.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.445
It's like a war zone.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.046
Because they have something
to be excited about.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.402
I have something to be excited about.

33:36.560 --> 33:38.927
Oh, oh, oh.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.328
Who were you gonna kiss at midnight?

33:42.200 --> 33:45.807
Oh. And then it's one big giant letdown.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.968
See, that's the problem with New Year's.

33:48.120 --> 33:52.648
Everybody builds up such high expectation that
they're inevitably, utterly disappointed.

33:52.840 --> 33:55.889
Hey, can you get through
that ceiling hatch?

33:56.800 --> 33:58.450
I am not Spider-Man.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.930
Clearly. Clearly.

34:01.160 --> 34:04.050
If I just climb right through there,
get out that window.

34:04.200 --> 34:06.646
And we're gonna be out of here.
I am gonna do it.

34:07.320 --> 34:09.561
Lift me up. Lift me up.
I don't have all day.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.409
There you go.
- Oh.

34:11.560 --> 34:12.766
It's a lock.

34:13.920 --> 34:16.730
Oh, I have a nail file.
I'll file it with my nail file.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.370
I'll file through it.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.801
Ugh. You're a groupie?

34:25.920 --> 34:27.159
Put me down.

34:28.440 --> 34:31.523
I got hats and horns and <i>hazarai.</i>
I got streamers...

34:31.679 --> 34:33.842
- Hey, Marvin. Hi. Happy New Year.
- Hey, Kim.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.606
- Mom, can I go tell my friends?
- Sure, yeah.

34:36.800 --> 34:37.847
Go ahead.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.002
So Hailey and I
are having a party tonight.

34:40.159 --> 34:41.525
Hey, wait up.

34:41.719 --> 34:44.451
- Hey. Um...
- Hey.

34:44.639 --> 34:46.005
I can't come.

34:46.400 --> 34:49.529
What? Hailey, what do you mean?
Half the history class is going.

34:49.679 --> 34:52.081
- I know. It's just my mom won't let me.
- You serious?

34:52.239 --> 34:54.561
I know. I sound like I'm 12, I know.

34:54.719 --> 34:57.451
All right, where's your mom? Maybe I...

34:57.600 --> 34:59.648
- Hi. Hi, Mrs. Doyle.
- Hi.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.165
You look lovely today.

35:01.320 --> 35:04.369
You seem like a nice boy.
I'm just not comfortable with Hailey...

35:04.520 --> 35:07.763
...spending tonight in Times Square
unsupervised.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.491
Right. With all due respect...

35:10.640 --> 35:13.530
supervision is for kids, you know?
We're young adults.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.047
Who are you calling?

35:17.200 --> 35:19.168
- You're Rose Anderson's son, right?
- Yeah.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.244
Yeah, we serve together on your
school's academic booster club.

35:22.680 --> 35:27.322
Oh. You know, I think she left her cell
phone at home. She gonna go out tonight.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.210
- Oh.
- Yeah.

35:29.800 --> 35:30.847
Okay.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.161
Happy New Year.

35:32.320 --> 35:33.845
Yeah. Happy New Year.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.089
You wanna say goodbye?

35:36.720 --> 35:38.085
So?

35:38.280 --> 35:40.248
Hailey, I tried. But she fights dirty.

35:41.320 --> 35:43.891
Yeah, I know. Welcome to my life.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.770
- Bye.
- Bye.

35:49.480 --> 35:53.007
Ladies, let's go. Yo.
Ladies, let's roll out!

35:53.160 --> 35:54.400
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

36:13.120 --> 36:17.045
What is this neighborhood? Is it safe?

36:17.200 --> 36:18.804
Give it a chance.

36:18.960 --> 36:22.362
"Give Paul a chance."

36:24.040 --> 36:25.371
I don't like it here.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.931
Maybe this is a really bad idea.
I'll just give you the tickets.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.361
<i>Give Paul a chance.</i>

36:31.520 --> 36:34.046
<i>Just give me a chance and I'll show you.</i>

36:34.240 --> 36:35.765
What I can do.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.241
Ingrid Withers...

36:40.360 --> 36:41.691
...go to Bali.

36:58.440 --> 37:00.204
It's Bali.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.006
It's Brooklyn.

37:02.600 --> 37:03.761
It's a spa.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.004
Thank you.

37:27.720 --> 37:30.041
I'm sorry. We really can't take you
this early yet.

37:30.200 --> 37:33.966
Dr. Morriset says that you're not ready.
You'll have to come back in a few hours.

37:34.120 --> 37:36.930
We may not have been ready,
but now she's eating anchovies...

37:37.080 --> 37:39.082
...which the Internet claims induce labor.

37:39.240 --> 37:40.765
If only you can keep it down.

37:40.920 --> 37:43.924
Yeah, but it really doesn't go that fast.

37:47.400 --> 37:50.244
- No. I can't do it. I can't do it.
- Excuse me.

37:50.680 --> 37:52.170
I'm sorry.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.924
I tried. I can't do it any more.

37:54.120 --> 37:55.724
You need a breath mint.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.368
Hey, Risa. So we are ready
to check in now.

37:58.520 --> 37:59.760
They're checking in?

38:04.600 --> 38:06.887
Hey. Good to see you again.

38:07.040 --> 38:10.647
You must be joking, because inside
I'm laughing really, really hard.

38:11.320 --> 38:15.166
You really think you can come into this
at the last minute and steal our money?

38:15.760 --> 38:17.000
I'm sorry, are you being serious?

38:18.600 --> 38:20.682
You are even a bigger numbnuts
than you look.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.842
This little fish won't save you.

38:23.480 --> 38:26.643
You probably don't even know
that yams can kick-start labor.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.245
Well, yeah, actually, we do.

38:28.400 --> 38:31.370
In fact, at this moment, my wife is
full of yams, but thank you.

38:31.520 --> 38:32.931
Crammed with yams.

38:33.280 --> 38:35.328
Snap. It doesn't.

38:35.560 --> 38:37.130
It stops pre-term labor.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.360
- Did he just snap me in a maternity ward?
- Yes.

38:40.560 --> 38:42.050
You're a really hostile guy.

38:42.360 --> 38:44.089
Where do you work, the DMV?

38:44.240 --> 38:45.844
No, I run a charm school.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.720
Oh, yeah? Where's your charm school,
Guantanamo?

38:49.720 --> 38:51.882
It's on 48th and Madison,
you should come by.

38:52.040 --> 38:54.361
Because you could really
use some charm.

38:55.440 --> 38:57.602
- He actually works at a charm school.
- No way.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.248
Ah. Prince of Charming.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.883
Hello, vision in pink.

39:08.280 --> 39:09.520
Can we check in now?

39:09.680 --> 39:12.081
Well, actually,
the ultrasound says it's a no.

39:12.280 --> 39:15.170
She's not ready either,
so you'll all have to come back later.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.810
I'm sorry, James.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.928
It's not your fault.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.287
- I'm sorry too.
- Right.

39:23.440 --> 39:26.603
- Also, it's on now, Prince Charming. Yeah.
- You bet.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.004
What are you doing, honey?

39:30.560 --> 39:33.131
Oh, it's on.

39:33.320 --> 39:35.527
- I'm sorry?
- Oh, no.

39:35.720 --> 39:36.767
What's on?

39:37.280 --> 39:38.964
Oh, yeah, this?

39:39.640 --> 39:42.007
- It's on.
- Come on. Let's go, honey.

39:42.160 --> 39:45.846
Nobody wins when pregnant women fight.
Come on. Come on.

39:47.960 --> 39:49.485
Something's on. Heh-heh.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.964
I know you gave up your
own plans tonight just to be with me.

39:56.160 --> 40:00.006
I can't become your everything, Mom.
Please don't become a Piper's mom.

40:00.160 --> 40:03.687
A what? "A Piper's mom"?

40:04.320 --> 40:06.721
What, you mean like Joanna?

40:07.160 --> 40:09.640
Yes, Piper's mom.
She hides in the bushes every day...

40:09.840 --> 40:12.684
...just to make sure that Piper
goes to school. It's nuts.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.650
- Come on. I'm not that bad.
- Mom, you've stopped trying.

40:15.800 --> 40:19.168
You're being clingy and mean,
because you don't have a man in your life.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.004
You really gotta find somebody.

40:21.160 --> 40:23.845
Look, Mom, you're a hot woman.

40:24.240 --> 40:27.847
If you'd just, you know,
lose the clogs, maybe?

40:30.040 --> 40:34.762
I'm sorry, but I am trying.
And I would like you to try.

40:34.920 --> 40:36.843
Just have our New Year's party.

40:37.000 --> 40:40.129
- And toot-toot, Happy New Year!
- Okay. Mom! Mom! No more.

40:41.160 --> 40:42.207
I'm over it.

40:43.160 --> 40:45.606
I'm over it and I'm over you.

40:49.880 --> 40:53.726
Why are we at the church? You were
supposed to take me to the rental car shop!

40:53.880 --> 40:55.882
Hey, James Bond,
I need one more signature.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.883
For what?! What am I even signing for?

40:58.040 --> 41:00.566
So you can get your car back.
Right there. Initials.

41:00.720 --> 41:02.722
Keep the pen, it's got my name on it.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.804
Didn't I tell you that
all the rental places close at 3?

41:05.960 --> 41:09.169
I've got you covered.
There's your ride right there. Hey, Edwin.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.010
Hey, Harley. Hey, Sam.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.889
Hey, he's the pastor.

41:13.040 --> 41:14.565
Yeah, that's right. It's the earmuffs.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.168
- So my cousin here tells me you need a lift.
- Cousin?

41:18.320 --> 41:22.689
I'm taking my wife and kids to see the Radio
City Rockettes. We do it every New Year's.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.490
Ever seen the Rockettes? Tch-tch.

41:24.640 --> 41:27.246
Happy to give you a lift.
You want to pitch in for gas?

41:27.400 --> 41:30.722
- Hell, yeah. I'll pay for all the gas.
- Don't say "hell," he's a pastor.

41:30.920 --> 41:32.331
Show him the book.

41:32.480 --> 41:34.289
Give me my pen back.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.847
I'll never understand people with hair.

41:37.240 --> 41:38.685
Thank you, Harley.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.324
There she is.

41:43.280 --> 41:44.964
How much gas are we talking about?

41:45.120 --> 41:47.043
What's your credit-card limit?

41:48.760 --> 41:50.285
ICU, how can I help you?

41:50.720 --> 41:52.563
Hi, Mr. Harris.

41:53.480 --> 41:55.130
How you doing today?

41:56.320 --> 41:57.367
Right.

41:57.520 --> 42:02.242
You've been here for weeks.
First no radiation, now no chemo. Why?

42:02.440 --> 42:06.047
What's the difference, you know?
Why delay the inevitable? I don't know.

42:07.080 --> 42:11.881
When I was a photographer in Vietnam,
I'd see death all the time.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.648
Nothing prepared me for this.

42:15.640 --> 42:18.450
I promise I'm gonna make you
as comfortable as I can, okay?

42:19.080 --> 42:21.367
Just get me to midnight and we're even.

42:21.520 --> 42:22.601
Okay.

42:24.560 --> 42:26.244
I'll be back.

42:33.720 --> 42:36.405
Honey? I've been thinking.

42:36.560 --> 42:38.324
Hailey?

42:47.480 --> 42:49.721
I fought so hard for custody.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.890
Hey, I got hats here!
What do you need? Yo! Scarves, hats!

42:53.040 --> 42:55.168
Happy New Year! Here, pick a hat.
Go ahead.

42:55.320 --> 42:57.288
Keep walking, then. Go ahead.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.248
Marvin!
- Kim!

43:02.400 --> 43:03.970
- Hailey!
- Up.

43:04.120 --> 43:05.645
Oh, thanks.

43:07.360 --> 43:09.328
Hey, yo. Happy New Year!

43:09.520 --> 43:10.851
Poppers, streamers, horns!

43:31.040 --> 43:32.530
Hailey!

43:40.400 --> 43:41.811
Calling you.

43:48.440 --> 43:49.771
<i>Hey, it's Hailey.</i>

43:49.920 --> 43:52.048
<i>Leave me a message
and I'll try and get back to you.</i>

44:04.800 --> 44:06.290
I think she decided.

44:06.440 --> 44:08.681
- You got a hat.
- You got a dog.

44:08.840 --> 44:10.285
Oh, it's a big responsibility.

44:10.440 --> 44:13.523
Yeah, but you gotta give it a chance.
Give it a chance, right?

44:13.680 --> 44:16.251
We'll give him his shots.
You can pick him up Monday.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.084
Or you can wait and think about it.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.411
No.

44:21.880 --> 44:23.689
- I'm done waiting.
- Yeah!

44:23.840 --> 44:27.322
We're gonna make each other
very happy. Aren't we?

44:27.480 --> 44:29.084
What are we gonna name him?

44:29.600 --> 44:32.490
- Um...
- Something manly like Kong.

44:32.680 --> 44:36.765
How about Mr. Snugglepuss?

44:36.920 --> 44:39.048
"Snugglepuss"?
You can decide on a name later.

44:39.200 --> 44:42.170
Anyways, look what you just did.

44:42.360 --> 44:45.250
Saved a life. Check.

44:46.400 --> 44:48.164
Take a trip around the world.

44:48.320 --> 44:51.051
It's a bit of a cheat. But check.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.288
It's 6:00 here in Times Square.

45:08.760 --> 45:13.129
And now to host tonight's festivities,
Mr. New Year's Eve himself:

45:13.280 --> 45:14.520
Ryan Seacrest!

45:22.160 --> 45:23.286
Thank you very much.

45:23.560 --> 45:25.005
Hello, New York City!

45:25.520 --> 45:26.806
I'm Ryan Seacrest.

45:26.960 --> 45:30.885
Are you ready to see the Times Square
ball being raised?

45:31.080 --> 45:34.243
We've been joined by several
members of the Times Square Alliance...

45:34.400 --> 45:36.289
...as they get ready for the ball drop.

45:36.440 --> 45:39.410
I know you're nervous,
but you have to look up, Jeffrey.

45:39.560 --> 45:41.289
Here we go!

46:01.640 --> 46:03.005
Uh-oh.

46:06.680 --> 46:08.921
That's not supposed to happen.

46:12.200 --> 46:14.680
Sorry, friends,
we have a bit of a hiccup here.

46:14.840 --> 46:17.810
We'll just sort that out, no problem.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.287
Stay with us, we'll be right back, okay?

46:21.320 --> 46:23.561
We will have it up and running
momentarily, right?

46:23.720 --> 46:25.085
Yeah. It's... There's...

46:25.240 --> 46:26.480
- Please? Please.
- Yes.

46:26.640 --> 46:30.167
I'm starting to feel a little bit of pressure.
Pressure's not great to feel.

46:30.320 --> 46:33.847
And it messes with my hair.
And I need my hair to be up. Like the ball.

46:37.840 --> 46:41.731
Go, guys, go. We gotta fix this
by midnight. Go, go, go.

46:42.240 --> 46:44.846
Whew. This would never have happened
to Dick Clark.

46:48.760 --> 46:51.570
- Can't you show me one special trick?
- I'm not a magician.

46:52.040 --> 46:54.566
- Okay?
- Are you in the Secret Service, mister?

46:54.720 --> 46:55.801
Duncan.

46:55.960 --> 46:58.122
So, what's the speech about, Sam?

46:58.280 --> 47:00.851
Like I said, I haven't even written it yet.

47:01.040 --> 47:04.089
I guess I'm still looking for
the inspiration.

47:05.920 --> 47:08.082
What inspires you, Sam?

47:09.280 --> 47:11.760
- Pizza.
- Excellent.

47:12.400 --> 47:13.606
Sweet.

47:14.080 --> 47:15.241
Okay, thanks.

47:17.920 --> 47:19.809
<i>Welcome to the Queens Museum...</i>

47:19.960 --> 47:23.442
<i>...featuring the New York City miniatures
depicting all five boroughs.</i>

47:26.400 --> 47:29.449
Walk all five boroughs in one day.

47:31.200 --> 47:32.850
Crossing that off the list.

47:36.960 --> 47:40.487
Yo, Randy, I know you said you didn't
wanna come out tonight, but listen.

47:40.640 --> 47:44.281
I made a deal with this lady
for four tickets to Ahern's VIP party.

47:44.560 --> 47:47.086
I don't know what her deal is, man.
She's just...

47:47.240 --> 47:49.925
...like, a couple sandwiches
short of a picnic. You know?

47:50.080 --> 47:53.801
Like a little bit pathetic.
In, like, a cute way.

47:53.960 --> 47:56.042
So, dude, please, please
call me back, bro.

47:56.200 --> 47:59.682
I need you. I need my wingman
at this party. Hit me back, bro.

48:00.560 --> 48:02.801
Okay. All right, next up...

48:03.480 --> 48:05.528
...is to be amazed.

48:06.160 --> 48:07.730
Which is very vague.

48:07.880 --> 48:11.680
I will be amazed if I can come up
with something. But I will.

48:12.240 --> 48:14.083
I don't wanna do this any more.

48:14.840 --> 48:16.251
What are you talking about?

48:18.040 --> 48:19.690
I'm pathetic...

48:20.200 --> 48:21.645
...dude.

48:24.400 --> 48:25.890
Hey.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.887
Wait, where are you going?

48:31.040 --> 48:32.769
Staten Island.

48:35.360 --> 48:39.490
- Miss Morgan, we're not sure what's wrong.
- How long will it take to be sure?

48:40.000 --> 48:43.049
I don't know. A couple minutes,
a couple hours, maybe more.

48:43.200 --> 48:46.249
We don't have a couple of hours.
We only have midnight.

48:46.440 --> 48:48.886
I have one job tonight. To make sure...

48:49.040 --> 48:53.045
...even if I have to do it with my own two
hands, that ball descends at midnight.

48:53.240 --> 48:54.651
You can't move midnight.

48:55.920 --> 48:59.447
Why are you looking at your shoes?
You're not telling me something.

48:59.600 --> 49:01.523
What are you not telling me?

49:05.600 --> 49:07.045
We need Kominsky.

49:07.560 --> 49:09.369
The Kominsky?

49:13.280 --> 49:14.611
Tess?

49:15.240 --> 49:17.447
Tess? You in the bathroom?

49:20.880 --> 49:21.961
What are you doing?

49:22.120 --> 49:24.009
Yoga. It's supposed to help.

49:24.160 --> 49:27.448
I'm no expert, but seems like that would
send the baby in the wrong direction.

49:29.280 --> 49:30.805
Let me help you.

49:30.960 --> 49:32.769
Oh...

49:32.920 --> 49:34.046
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

49:34.240 --> 49:36.242
And I got a discount
with my vet school ID.

49:36.400 --> 49:38.607
You'll make such a good
veterinarian someday.

49:38.760 --> 49:41.525
Thanks. And if you were a horse,
I'd know what to do.

49:41.680 --> 49:45.366
Of course, if you were a horse,
we'd never get invited to dinner parties...

49:45.520 --> 49:47.761
- ...and I'd be married to a horse.
- Ha-ha-ha.

49:47.960 --> 49:49.689
This smells awful.

49:50.080 --> 49:52.367
- Drink it.
- Mm-mm.

49:52.520 --> 49:53.681
What? It's castor oil.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.331
Mary Poppins swore by this.

49:55.480 --> 49:58.051
Mary Poppins also danced
with cartoon penguins.

49:58.200 --> 49:59.531
You first.

49:59.760 --> 50:01.250
You're a coward.

50:04.080 --> 50:06.686
- Mm. Mm.
- Hmm. I'm sensing a thumbs down.

50:06.840 --> 50:08.729
Ugh. Mary Poppins sucks.

50:08.920 --> 50:11.526
Well, you forgot about
the spoonful of sugar. Ooh.

50:11.680 --> 50:13.648
- What was that?
- What was what?

50:13.800 --> 50:15.529
Oh, my gosh. My water broke.

50:16.360 --> 50:17.850
- All of it?
- Oh.

50:18.240 --> 50:19.321
Well, what do you think?

50:19.480 --> 50:21.642
Well, that's too early.
Can you turn it off?

50:21.800 --> 50:23.802
- And how do you suggest I do that?
- Yoga?

50:23.960 --> 50:27.851
Get upside down. You can do a downward
dog or an upward dog. Do one of the dogs.

50:28.040 --> 50:30.361
- Okay, we need to pack!
- We have packed.

50:30.520 --> 50:32.090
- Okay, calm.
- Taxi!

50:32.240 --> 50:36.370
- I don't think we're gonna get one up here.
- Right, we gotta go where the cars live.

50:36.520 --> 50:38.727
- Pants, I need pants.
- Okay.

50:40.800 --> 50:42.086
These are your pants.

50:42.800 --> 50:44.802
Give me the cute pink ones.

50:45.120 --> 50:46.690
Don't throw them at me.

50:48.760 --> 50:50.410
Okay, so I'll meet you there?

50:52.480 --> 50:53.766
You should come with me.

50:53.920 --> 50:56.082
- We should both go.
- Oh...

50:56.280 --> 50:58.362
Lady with a baby coming through.

50:58.520 --> 51:01.364
Taxi! Pregnant! Taxi!

51:02.800 --> 51:05.690
Okay. Want me to help?

51:05.840 --> 51:09.811
Honey, I spent my whole life
living in New York City.

51:10.000 --> 51:12.002
I think I know how to get a taxicab.

51:12.160 --> 51:14.640
- Yeah.
- No! No!

51:15.040 --> 51:18.044
Hah. Good job, homeboy.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.369
All right. Plan B. Hold this.

51:20.520 --> 51:22.284
- Ch!

51:25.880 --> 51:27.723
Be here now.

51:27.880 --> 51:29.120
Taxi!

51:29.840 --> 51:31.205
You're doing great, honey.

51:31.360 --> 51:32.805
- You're doing great.
- Oh!

51:35.320 --> 51:37.004
Can't we pedal faster?

51:37.600 --> 51:40.649
- Hey, buddy, can you go a little faster?
- This is my faster.

51:42.760 --> 51:44.569
Haven't you been here all day?

51:45.720 --> 51:48.690
- When do you go home?
- Just before midnight.

51:48.840 --> 51:50.001
Ah.

51:50.160 --> 51:54.563
You know what, I don't care about
all that hoopla and stuff anyway.

51:54.720 --> 51:57.485
So no big plans? A party or...?

51:57.640 --> 51:58.801
Nope.

51:58.960 --> 52:01.804
No hot date? Pretty girl like you.

52:01.960 --> 52:03.166
Well...

52:03.760 --> 52:05.046
...maybe.

52:05.520 --> 52:07.841
But right now you're my hot date.

52:08.840 --> 52:11.127
- Why?
- Pardon me?

52:11.320 --> 52:14.085
Why would you wanna be nice to me?

52:15.960 --> 52:17.450
I'm an ass.

52:17.840 --> 52:20.730
I spent my entire whole life being an ass.

52:20.880 --> 52:24.805
And I don't know how to stop.

52:25.680 --> 52:27.523
Well, you know what, Stan?

52:27.680 --> 52:32.481
Maybe being an ass is the reason you've
gotten every single thing you ever wanted.

52:33.400 --> 52:34.561
Not everything.

52:38.120 --> 52:40.361
I'm sorry I called you a groupie.

52:40.560 --> 52:44.087
We're stuck in an elevator together.
You're not gonna talk to me at all?

52:44.360 --> 52:47.762
Fine. We can talk.

52:48.080 --> 52:51.766
But as long as we're making
assumptions about each other...

52:51.920 --> 52:53.365
...why don't I give it a shot?

52:55.520 --> 52:58.524
You grew up in suburban
fill-in-the-blank.

52:58.680 --> 53:00.887
You went to la-di-da liberal-arts school.

53:01.080 --> 53:03.481
You didn't have enough drive
to get a real job...

53:03.640 --> 53:05.529
...and then you grew half a beard...

53:05.680 --> 53:09.571
...and moved to Manhattan
on your grandmother's inheritance.

53:09.720 --> 53:14.009
And now you think that just because you
moved somewhere that makes you cool...

53:14.160 --> 53:16.447
...but the truth is,
is that it doesn't. Okay?

53:16.600 --> 53:20.161
Because you're just some wannabe
hipster who judges everything...

53:20.320 --> 53:23.005
...because you're too scared
to take a chance on anything.

53:23.160 --> 53:27.802
And, you know, my guess is that
this whole hatred for New Year's...

53:27.960 --> 53:30.281
...comes from some
boring-as-hell prom queen...

53:30.440 --> 53:35.367
...who broke your heart on New Year's Eve
in high school. So, what, am I close?

53:37.400 --> 53:39.209
Suburban Maryland.

53:39.400 --> 53:41.129
Tufts University.

53:41.840 --> 53:43.729
And I am a comic-book artist.

53:44.880 --> 53:46.120
You draw?

53:46.480 --> 53:47.481
I illustrate.

53:49.440 --> 53:50.885
And it was in college...

53:51.440 --> 53:52.805
...when she broke it.

53:54.480 --> 53:56.767
And this beard took me
like a year to grow.

53:58.280 --> 53:59.520
Cold coffee?

54:02.960 --> 54:05.725
Last year there were so many speeches,
I had to get outside.

54:05.880 --> 54:07.848
So I actually went out
and got a pizza. Heh.

54:08.320 --> 54:09.845
Did anything else happen?

54:11.280 --> 54:14.011
Oh, my. Something else did happen,
didn't it?

54:15.880 --> 54:17.564
- Yes.
- Is it R-rated?

54:18.680 --> 54:20.011
Dad.

54:20.680 --> 54:22.648
- I met a woman...
- Oh.

54:22.960 --> 54:25.884
...and she was extraordinary.

54:26.040 --> 54:28.520
It's gonna have a goosebump ending.

54:28.680 --> 54:31.524
Take your time telling it,
because here comes the traffic.

54:33.680 --> 54:35.603
Extraordinary build, huh?

54:36.480 --> 54:38.289
I have to get to this party.

54:40.240 --> 54:44.643
Welcome to the Brooklyn Museum and
the Ahern party. Please pull right up, sir.

54:45.840 --> 54:48.366
<i>Put on 'em ball
When they sleep at the Macy's.</i>

54:48.720 --> 54:52.167
Penny. Penny. Just quick one picture.
Right over here!

54:52.320 --> 54:55.210
<i>Tied over money like Seacrest
Put it on my life, baby.</i>

54:55.360 --> 54:56.850
<i>I can make you feel right, baby.</i>

54:57.000 --> 54:58.684
<i>- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.</i>

54:58.840 --> 55:02.401
<i>But I might drink a little bit
More than I should tonight.</i>

55:02.560 --> 55:05.564
<i>And I might take you home with me
If I could tonight.</i>

55:05.720 --> 55:07.324
You're an actress, right?

55:07.600 --> 55:11.685
Yeah. I've played a nurse, a cop,
a teacher.

55:11.840 --> 55:14.241
How about playing a waitress
and getting me a drink?

55:14.400 --> 55:15.925
Go ahead. Scoot, scoot.

55:16.120 --> 55:17.326
<i>And now, your hostess...</i>

55:17.480 --> 55:19.482
<i>...the president of Ahern Records,
Mrs. Rose Ahern.</i>

55:19.640 --> 55:24.089
Welcome to the Ahern Records
Masked Ball.

55:24.240 --> 55:28.290
What better way to end this year,
both good and bad...

55:28.440 --> 55:30.204
...than with the very, very best...

55:30.360 --> 55:33.842
...and you all know exactly who
I'm talking about.

55:34.320 --> 55:39.360
So I'll simply say that coming up
on this stage very soon...

55:39.560 --> 55:44.248
...one of the hottest names
Jensen!

55:49.320 --> 55:51.402
I went to Juilliard...

55:51.560 --> 55:53.881
...and I am a backup singer.

55:54.040 --> 55:57.408
Not a back-of-the-tour-bus groupie.

55:58.040 --> 56:02.443
- Randy, a.k.a. Mr. Moron.
- Heh.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.890
- How long you been a backup singer?
- Too long.

56:07.120 --> 56:09.691
Oh, I just got hired for tonight...

56:09.880 --> 56:14.442
...but I was hoping that he would ask me
to go on tour with him. But...

56:14.640 --> 56:16.290
You could sing something for me.

56:16.440 --> 56:18.727
Oh, no. Ha-ha-ha. No.

56:18.880 --> 56:23.568
The only time that I do performances for
audiences of one is when I'm in the shower.

56:23.720 --> 56:26.803
- Well, you...
- Don't say anything.

56:28.320 --> 56:31.642
<i>Anxiety is now the prevailing mood
here at One Times Square.</i>

56:31.800 --> 56:33.689
The ball is still in a state of stuck.

56:33.840 --> 56:37.925
...As officials await the arrival of
electrical whiz Lester Kominsky.

56:40.840 --> 56:43.491
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak Spanish.
I'm from Ohio.

56:46.480 --> 56:48.642
- Your coffee.
- Thank you.

56:50.320 --> 56:53.005
<i>The eagle has landed.</i>
- Kominsky's here.

56:53.920 --> 56:56.844
Make a hole, people. Move.

57:04.480 --> 57:06.084
Kominsky.

57:07.640 --> 57:09.165
I'm Claire Morgan.

57:09.360 --> 57:10.771
Oh, no. Kominsky.

57:10.920 --> 57:13.082
- Kominsky's here, yes.
- Yes.

57:13.280 --> 57:16.045
Oh. Thank you so much for coming.

57:16.240 --> 57:17.765
Yes, it's good.

57:17.920 --> 57:22.289
- You fire me.
- No, no. No, that was someone else. No.

57:22.600 --> 57:24.762
So, what do you think it is?

57:24.960 --> 57:26.724
- Short.
- What's short?

57:26.920 --> 57:28.445
A short in the ball.

57:28.600 --> 57:29.647
You got it.

57:29.840 --> 57:31.683
- Sounds pretty straightforward.
- Mm-hm.

57:31.880 --> 57:33.211
Easy to fix.

57:33.360 --> 57:35.124
- Then you fix.
- No.

57:35.280 --> 57:36.406
Not so easy.

57:36.560 --> 57:38.927
This ball has 3500 lighting clues.

57:39.080 --> 57:41.447
Cues. He means cues.

57:41.640 --> 57:44.211
You have to find the light
that went out in over 3000?

57:44.360 --> 57:45.771
- Mm-hm.
- Wh...?

57:45.920 --> 57:50.209
Have we not progressed past the Christmas
lights that go out if there's one bad one?

57:50.400 --> 57:54.371
My question also and then I get fired,
so that's all.

57:54.520 --> 57:56.568
Oh, wait. We need you.

57:57.920 --> 57:59.490
I need you.

58:02.880 --> 58:07.681
Okay. Then I go visit my ball
on the roof. And...

58:08.400 --> 58:09.686
These TV peoples here?

58:10.160 --> 58:11.650
- Yes.
- Oh.

58:11.840 --> 58:12.887
Here.

58:13.920 --> 58:16.605
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

58:17.560 --> 58:18.971
Good. Thank you.

58:19.120 --> 58:21.691
<i>Please enjoy our New Year's Eve
entertainment...</i>

58:21.840 --> 58:26.129
<i>...as we go to Ginger Adams and some
young revelers in the 54th Street pen.</i>

58:26.280 --> 58:27.327
<i>Ginger.</i>

58:27.520 --> 58:29.841
This little boy is lost.
Go with the nice lady.

58:30.280 --> 58:32.886
- What's your name?
- Scott. I can't find my mom.

58:33.040 --> 58:35.122
Whoa! Who lost this kid?

58:35.320 --> 58:36.765
I did, I did.

58:36.920 --> 58:38.046
I'm coming, Mom.

58:38.240 --> 58:39.401
- I got him.
- Take it easy.

58:39.560 --> 58:41.050
- Be careful.
- Whoa, thattaboy.

58:41.240 --> 58:42.287
Watch it!

58:42.440 --> 58:43.885
Mom, look at me.

58:44.080 --> 58:45.445
I got him. I got him.

58:48.080 --> 58:49.206
Hey, is she here?

58:49.360 --> 58:53.604
I haven't seen Piper's mom,
but I know she's around here somewhere.

58:55.120 --> 58:58.124
- Who are you gonna kiss at midnight?
- You, baby.

58:58.280 --> 59:00.681
I'm flattered, but I'm also spoken for.

59:01.240 --> 59:05.768
<i>We now go live to New Year's headquarters
for an update on the situation.</i>

59:10.200 --> 59:13.807
Hello, I'm Claire Morgan
of the Times Square Alliance...

59:13.960 --> 59:16.770
...and, as you all can see...

59:16.960 --> 59:19.964
...the ball has stopped halfway
to its perch.

59:22.000 --> 59:24.241
It's suspended there to remind us...

59:24.400 --> 59:29.008
...before we pop the champagne
and celebrate the new year...

59:30.480 --> 59:33.848
...to stop...

59:34.840 --> 59:38.003
...and reflect on the year
that has gone by.

59:38.640 --> 59:43.885
<i>To remember both our triumphs
and our missteps.</i>

59:44.800 --> 59:48.600
<i>Our promises made and broken.</i>

59:50.800 --> 59:54.009
<i>The times we opened ourselves up
to great adventures...</i>

59:54.600 --> 59:59.162
<i>...or closed ourself down
for fear of getting hurt.</i>

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.000
<i>Because that's what New Year's
is all about.</i>

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.450
<i>Getting another chance.</i>

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.723
<i>A chance to forgive.</i>

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:15.051
To do better, to do more,
to give more, to love more.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.203
<i>And to stop worrying about
"what if"...</i>

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.886
<i>...and start embracing what will be.</i>

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:26.531
<i>So when that ball drops at midnight...</i>

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.929
<i>...and it will drop...</i>

01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:32.607
<i>...let's remember to be nice
to each other.</i>

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.850
<i>Kind to each other.</i>

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.605
<i>And not just tonight, but all year long.</i>

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.884
Thank you.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.644
I want to hear the rest of your story.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:02.128
We talked for... It felt like hours.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:04.568
- You boink her?
- Dad.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.367
- You're talking to a man in a tuxedo.
- I can't talk like that in front of a lady.

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.251
- He's a gentleman.
- We talked, all right?

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.962
I went on and on about the business
and how our stock had just gone public.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.691
She stops me, she puts her hand
over mine and she says:

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.888
"That's all great, but how's your heart?"

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.567
"How's your he...?" Who says that?

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.042
- I mean, I never met anyone that said that...
- Please. Please.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.526
Did you at least kiss her?

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.170
Yes. At midnight.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.806
And that's it?

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:38.011
Well, I went to the restroom a little
bit later and when I came back...

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.605
- ...she was gone.
- Oh.

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.886
- She left something on the table.
- Naked picture?

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.121
Let me see.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.205
Read it out loud, Maude.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.085
"Things are complicated.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.641
If you're still thinking about me
in a year...

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.485
...meet me back here
at La Gambina Trattoria...

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:00.962
- ...at midnight next New Year's Eve."
- Midnight next New Year's Eve.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.610
You memorized it.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.284
You're gonna meet her, aren't you?

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:11.088
Yeah, I don't think so.
I mean, I don't even know her name.

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.084
You're afraid.

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:17.131
She's not gonna be there.
It was one night. It wasn't even real.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:22.081
But this napkin is. And you've been
carrying it around for a year.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.322
I mean, you went out
for a slice of pizza...

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.723
...and you may have run into the one.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.086
You know what that is?

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.528
- Insanity?
- Not insanity.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.803
Serendipity. Hmm?

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.362
- And you don't mess with serendipity.
- What's the worst that could happen?

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.722
She doesn't show up,
you go back to your party.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.642
Oh, that's not it at all, is it, Sam?

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.611
You're afraid that she will show up.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.800
I'll tell you what.
I'll take care of this for you.

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:55.531
- I can tap this.
- He can tap this.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.445
I'm gonna step up and tap this for you.
Look, I'm a widower.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.204
- Right?
- Forgive him.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.726
- Hey, sis.
- Have you heard from Hailey?

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.850
- Calm down. What, is she AWOL?
- Yes.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.527
It's New Year's Eve. She's a teenager.
She's being her mother's daughter.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.762
- Can you hold on for one second?
- Yeah, sure.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.445
I can't see.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.689
I was never that defiant.

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:29.049
I mean, you should've seen
the way she looked at me.

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.641
I'm confused.
I thought you had plans tonight.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:33.962
<i>I sort of did.
But I chose to be with Hailey...</i>

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:35.969
...and now she's gone.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.049
I'm not really worried about Hailey.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.851
<i>I'm more worried about you.
If you're not working...</i>

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:44.567
...you need to have some fun. Let your
hair down. Leave the clogs at home.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.484
Oh, great, more clog commentary. Ooh.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.881
Goodness. I'm so sorry, sir.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:53.443
Listen, Paul, right now, all I really
need to do is just find Hailey.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.687
All right, look.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.320
<i>She's a good kid, okay?</i>

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.802
If she did happen to call her cool uncle
to say where she'd be...

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.404
...she may, in fact, have said
the 54th Street pen.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.689
<i>But please don't rat out the cool uncle.</i>

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.650
Paul, thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you. Excuse me.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.211
<i>Wait, wait! Sis, hold on.</i>

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:15.523
- I got a huge favor to ask.
- Anything. What, what, what? What?

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.605
"Be amazed."

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.171
I got it.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:24.051
Ingrid, please don't let this
whole thing be ruined...

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.123
...because I'm a big-mouthed idiot.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.285
I'm sick and tired of being that guy.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.969
Please, Ingrid.

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.170
Please.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.450
Come with me.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.880
Come on! Let's go.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.371
On one condition.

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.284
- Whoo!
- Yeah, there you go.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:46.967
Here we go!

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:50.408
- See? All right, right turn. Lean into it.
- Aah!

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.925
<i>Lean, lean, lean.</i>

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:57.040
That was a nice speech.
- Well, I was just trying to save my job.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.163
No, I don't think so.

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.609
I think you were talking about you.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:06.448
Okay, maybe I was,
but all I can do is reflect...

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.244
...and try and do better next year.

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.640
Or sooner.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.202
Now, why'd I tell you about him?

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:18.081
I'm a New York cop.
People, they tell me things.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.004
I'm sure he's forgotten it by now.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.366
You should go.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.970
I don't move until the ball moves.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.051
This is so exciting.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.806
In my entire life,
I have never won a contest before.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:34.045
And I'm also excited about the baby.
I think that's the most exciting thing.

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:38.290
- Anchovy man.
- Yam liar.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.683
- Grace, I'm gonna sign us in, okay?
- I'll just be right back.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.327
- Griffin Byrne, checking in.
- Schwab, very proud to check in this hotel.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.723
I'm sorry about James.
He's very competitive.

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.727
Well, I should apologize too.
I really didn't mean that anything was on.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.689
Ooh.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.963
- Contractions?
- Six minutes apart.

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:06.485
We have five minutes apart.

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.971
- Cervix?
- She has one.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.250
- Four centimeters dilated.
- Four? We are five... Six... Seven!

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.566
Maybe eight.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.242
Don't you show your head to me
young lady!

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.529
Not yet! Papa will tell you
when it's time, okay?

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.691
- Oh, please don't yell at my vagina.
- Oh, I never will.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.887
It's amazing.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.401
She really listens to James.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.562
She just crawled right back up in there.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.969
The nurses will take you to your rooms.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.129
Gentlemen, to your corners.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:39.409
And, ladies, may the best va-jay-jay win.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.929
Good luck.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.561
- Let's see it. Ha-ha-ha.
- Let's see it.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.245
<i>La la la</i>

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.522
Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll sing.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.887
- You don't like my voice?
- You draw. I'll sing.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:58.965
Laura, can we take a break?
Jensen's going on in a minute.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.246
Do you want to go see?

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:05.291
No. I'm a professional,
I can't be seen gawking at the talent.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.885
Well, I'm gonna gawk.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:12.286
Ahh. I'm gonna try to get close to
the stage to get spit and sweat on.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:26.001
<i>When the road gets dark</i>

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:32.805
<i>And you can no longer see</i>

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:37.769
<i>Let my love throw a spark</i>

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:44.246
<i>And have a little faith in me</i>

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:55.169
<i>And when the tears you cry</i>

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:01.807
<i>Are all you can believe</i>

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:06.761
<i>Just give these loving arms a try, baby</i>

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:12.010
<i>And have a little faith in me</i>

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:16.165
<i>Have a little faith in me</i>

01:08:18.479 --> 01:08:21.689
<i>Have a little faith in me</i>

01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:27.124
<i>Have a little faith in me</i>

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:34.448
<i>Have a little faith in me</i>

01:08:37.319 --> 01:08:40.926
<i>'Cause I've been loving you
For such a long time, girl</i>

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:46.644
<i>Expecting nothing in return
Just for you to have a little faith in me</i>

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.964
<i>You see, time
Time is our friend</i>

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.361
<i>'Cause for us, there is no end</i>

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:58.645
<i>All you gotta do
ls, baby, have a little bit of faith in me</i>

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:02.247
<i>I said, I will hold you up
I will hold you up</i>

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:05.721
<i>I will hold you up
I will hold you up now</i>

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:09.885
<i>All you gotta do
ls have a little faith in me</i>

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:16.247
<i>You see, time is our friend</i>

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:19.085
<i>Oh, baby</i>

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:25.319
<i>Have a little faith in me</i>

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:32.200
<i>Have a little faith in me</i>

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:43.724
<i>Have a little faith in me</i>

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.125
All right, let me see.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.805
Let me see.

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.441
That's me?

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.204
I look crazy.

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.163
- Do you have any other hobbies?
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.969
Hey.

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.571
There you...

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.085
You're so good.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:30.641
You always were.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:33.448
I'm not really that good.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.682
Yes, you are. Yeah.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.491
I was thinking about the ball drop...

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.330
...and how that always
used to be our thing.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:46.606
Remember when I took you to New York
for the first time?

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.565
We watched the ball drop together?
You remember?

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.810
That was our night.

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:56.807
And I promised you we'd bring...

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:00.085
We would go back there...

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:05.290
Well, another promise I didn't live up to.
I'm sorry.

01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.050
Now, why did I leave you?

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.609
Stan, I'm Aimee.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.642
Remember? Nurse Aimee?

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.045
Hmm?

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.171
Oh. Right.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.367
Right. Aimee.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.846
Call me back or I'm gonna give away
your ticket. I'm gonna give it away.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.684
Paul, it's me, Murray. Are we ready to go?

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.887
Let's go!

01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:56.045
Ladies and gentlemen,
one-night-only engagement.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:00.967
Radio City Music Hall is proud to present,
on her resolution tour:

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.163
Ingrid Withers!

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.721
<i>Just hear those sleigh bells jingling.</i>

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.524
<i>Ring-ting-tingling too</i>

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.045
All right.

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.647
- Oh, my God. Whoo!
- Bravo!

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.847
Bravo!

01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.127
Are you amazed?

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.051
I'm amazed you got me to do this!

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:24.531
Amazing!

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.331
"Be amazed"? Check.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:30.926
<i>Come on, it's lovely weather</i>

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:35.487
This is great.

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.449
This is great. Okay.

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:40.122
Okay. Let me down now.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:48.245
We've been stuck in here for hours.
I can't believe nobody's found us yet.

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:55.489
- We could have our own party.
- Hmm.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.644
- I don't think so.
- Oh, come on!

01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:02.522
We got to do something to get you
out of your New Year's Eve funk.

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.769
We're at a party.

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.321
Mm.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:14.807
You're standing on one end of the room
alone, and I'm on the other.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.648
- We've never met.
- Ooh.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.723
And the countdown begins.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:23.327
You start scanning the room
for cute girls...

01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.721
...amongst the sea of couples.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.251
- Cute girls.
- Ten.

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.846
Nine.

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.851
Eight.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:33.330
Seven.

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.129
Finally, you see me.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.169
- Our eyes meet.
- There you are.

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.042
We smile tentatively at each other.

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:43.810
- Six.
- Tentatively.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.606
Then we start walking
towards each other.

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.360
Five.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.450
Finally, we meet.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:52.806
Four.

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:55.008
Just as it's about to be midnight.

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.410
- Three.
- Three.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.610
- Two.
- Two.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:04.647
One.

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.847
Oh.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.570
- Hey!
- Now you come.

01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.051
Hmm.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.167
See, I told you I'd have it fixed.
In just eight hours.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.650
Phone's broken.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.691
Hey, you didn't, uh, you know...

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.842
That's not why we put the bench in.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.322
Oh, no, no. It's not like that.

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.721
Yeah, it's always like that.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.690
- This was not like that.
- Oh, it's always like that.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.890
- We just met on...
- All right. I'll check out the video.

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.011
Okay.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.522
All right! Come on in.

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:58.126
- Looks like you still might make your gig.
- Yeah.

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.204
So Jensen's playing at Times Square?

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:04.922
Yeah. With or without me,
so I should really get going.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:10.011
Okay.

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:14.569
- See you.
- Yeah. Happy New... Uh...

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.526
I'll see you.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:21.761
Uh...

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.285
Let me...

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:25.401
Sorry.

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.687
Hold the elevator.

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:34.644
Sorry. Let me just...

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.088
This gate is a bitch.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:49.844
- Mrs. Lifflander, you've been working out.
- Thank you.

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.322
Hey, you forgot"!

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.402
Oh, this is amazing,
I can totally see him.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:06.963
What?! He's coming out?
You can see him?

01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:09.841
Okay, if you try to see, I can't see.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.724
Look with your other eye!

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:15.129
Oh, hostility, that's good.
Yes, now we're getting somewhere.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.568
I can't see the baby. I can see that couple
trying to steal our money.

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:20.000
Oh, this is great, babe.

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:23.050
So, look, if I do this, that means
they're having their baby.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.884
I don't care about the money any more.

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.407
What?
- Hey, Griff?

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:28.681
Come here.

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:33.008
- You are disturbing her calm zone.
- You're disturbing my calm zone.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.650
What? Uhn.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.402
I need you to focus.

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:43.803
I'm just trying to squeeze a giant Escalade
out of a compact fucking parking spot!

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:45.720
Nice.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:49.362
Swearing helps sometimes.
But now we're gonna use our words, right?

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.164
- We're ready to go.
- Uh...

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.567
Bye, I love you.

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.769
- Time to take the children to the playroom.
- Come on, guys.

01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.965
Next time I see you, you're gonna
have a baby sister. I love you.

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.168
- Bye, Mommy.
- Bye.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.891
- A lobster?
- Yeah.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.326
Dissolve.

01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:10.403
Dissolve.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:14.889
Assuage.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.128
Very good. You are the channel.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:24.850
I am the perfect channel.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.809
- Perfect channel.
- Ooh...

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:28.571
Okay.

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.091
- Change the channel. Change it!
Mm-hm.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.571
Click, click, click.

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:46.009
- Watch it.
- What happened to the steps there? Hey.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:50.161
It's been a real treat getting to know you
and the family. Grandpa Jed.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.526
Very cool, very horny.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.251
You got a chance to see how
the other half lives, huh?

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.209
You make the other half look good.

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.886
Ah. You seem to have a pretty fun life.

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.166
It has its moments.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.762
- Remember, follow your heart.
- All right, I will. I'll see you.

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.604
- You have to let me in!
- I'm sorry.

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.364
You need a pass to get back there.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:14.091
I'm practically related to him.
We're both from Jersey.

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.811
- Is this the 54th Street pen?
- 56th. 54th is that way.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.731
- You have to let me in.
- Without a pass, I can't.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:25.125
Hailey's coming.
- Yeah.

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:29.282
<i>We're getting closer, folks.
Hope you're staying warm.</i>

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:35.049
This is it. This is as close to
the ball dropping as I can get you.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.931
Hey, good luck with that last one,
all right?

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.127
No.

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.001
- I figured that was a long shot.
- A long shot? What are you talking about?

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:45.128
Going to Bali? That was a long shot.

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:49.164
Let's get this out of here, okay?

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:52.130
Man, I don't even know whose
this is, bro. I'm just saying.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.447
Thanks.

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:55.885
Make a list of your own.

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.443
Don't wait as long as I did.

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:00.449
Pow, pow, shwing.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:02.648
Thank you. Mm.

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:05.280
Good bye.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.686
Good bye.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:13.963
- Have a great time.
- You too. Happy New Year, Ingrid.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.170
Whoo.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:29.843
Any ideas who you might
want to kiss at midnight?

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.411
Oh.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.284
- Hey, Laura!
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:35.727
- They're raving about the food out there.
- Great.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.850
I hear this is a first for
the music industry.

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.045
Sam's here.
- He is.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.090
Sam!
- Oh, hey, Alyssa.

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.129
- I'll get your favorite drink?
- Thank you.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.763
Hey, Mom.

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:51.001
Sorry I'm late.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.400
But I made it.

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:55.166
Thank you for wearing
your father's tuxedo.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:58.403
- Perfect fit, huh?
- You look so handsome.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.602
Hey there, iPod. How are you?

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.609
All your pretty little girls are here.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.728
I'm starting to think I need more...

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:07.486
...than a pretty a girl with nothing
to say, you know?

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.483
Did maturity just walk into the room?

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:11.848
Well, maybe, maybe not.

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.768
You know what you're gonna say
to these people?

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.680
Yes. Yes, I do.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:22.647
<i>Coming up next on the main stage,
Ahern Records recording artist, Jensen!</i>

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.368
- Where's Jensen?
- Still waiting on him.

01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:31.081
But the president of the Times Square
Alliance would like a word.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:34.244
- Mr. Buellerton's here?
- He's right here.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.242
Mr. Buellerton. You wanted to see me?

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.925
Yes, Claire.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:42.526
You spoke eloquently about the ball
getting stuck.

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.842
- You assuaged everyone's fears.
- Thank you.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.082
- Except mine.
- Oh, of course.

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:50.528
Now, I like assuagion, but I don't
think you realize what's at stake.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:51.727
Oh, I do, sir.

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.360
You're about to let down
the city of New York...

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:58.081
...the country, the whole world,
unless you get that ball fixed.

01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:04.601
With all due respect, sir, I've been watching
the ball drop since I was 5 years old...

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.411
...and it's one of my most favorite
family memories.

01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:09.562
We'll... We'll be sure to get this fixed.

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.290
"We'll"? "We'll"?

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:14.284
You remember the '86 Mets-Red Sox
World Series?

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:15.566
No.

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:18.440
Bill Buckner let a ground ball
go between his legs...

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.889
...and the Sox lost the game,
and eventually, the World Series.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:25.123
Now, very few people remember
who was on the field that day...

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:28.727
...but everyone remembers
that Buckner missed the ball.

01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.963
A baseball's a lot smaller than your ball,
which is not dropping.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:36.887
Right. I'll be sure that I don't drop
the ball on the ball drop.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:39.327
- Whatever you said. Anyway, fix it.
- I will.

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:43.724
Or you'll hear a speech about the new vice
president of the Times Square Alliance.

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:47.248
Okay. I'm not gonna let you down,
or the world. I promise, sir.

01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:52.280
Um, okay, I'm gonna check on Kominsky.
You find Jensen.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.649
Somebody get me Jensen!

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:57.411
- Hey, sorry I'm late.
- Okay. Who are you?

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.642
I'm Elise, one of Jensen's
backup singers.

01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:00.926
Where's Jensen?

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.161
I don't know.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.288
Go take the stage. That way, that way.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.608
- Where is he?
<i>- Still</i> no rock star.

01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:09.843
Hey! 5B! Hi.
- Hey. Hi. Randy.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.684
How'd you get in?

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:14.002
They think I'm Jensen's drummer.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.366
Because I told them that.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:20.527
Here. You left this on the elevator.
I didn't know if it was lucky or something.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:22.165
And also it's a balance thing.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:26.609
So if you dance while you're singing,
you'll need your balance.

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:27.807
Thanks.

01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:33.451
You came all the way here to bring me
my rubber bracelet?

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.931
Sort of.

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:38.289
And to say happy New Year.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.563
Happy New Year, Randy.

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:48.571
Oh, you also left something else
on the elevator.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.570
Glad you remembered that.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.888
<i>Background singers report to stage.</i>

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.885
I gotta go. Ha-ha.

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.730
Okay, well, go watch.

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:12.527
- For you, I will be your groupie.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:14.887
Hey! Nice pajamas.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.008
<i>Background singers report to stage.</i>

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.561
Keep them busy. Try doing the wave.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.411
If Jensen doesn't show up,
you're gonna sing.

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:24.250
- Jensen's here.
- Where?

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.767
- He's not happy.
- Oh. Why would he be?

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:32.882
Mr. Jensen, hi.
What seems to be the problem?

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.407
Yeah, I saw your speech on TV today.

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:38.609
I'm Claire Morgan.
I'm the one that hired you.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:40.922
Hi. Boy meets girl...

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:44.402
- ...boy screws up, boy loses girl.
- Oh.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.444
Um... ls there any way I can help you?

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.090
I don't think so.

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.449
Well, it is New Year's Eve.
Anything's possible.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:55.285
Not this time.
I think I really screwed it up.

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.966
I don't think I deserve a second chance.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:00.325
You know what that feels like?

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:04.161
Actually, I do.

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:07.961
I have the same situation
going on right now.

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.565
Um...

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:14.248
Maybe all this is too much for her, huh?
I don't know. Maybe...

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:19.487
Maybe all she wants is to not have to
share you with the rest of the world.

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.965
Sounds familiar.

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.640
- We girls, we have a handbook.
- Miss Morgan.

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:32.726
Um... Well, I need to go fix the ball,
and you need to fix what you broke too.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:34.490
But will you please sing first?

01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:35.961
Please.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:40.564
And don't forget, second chances,
they don't expire until midnight.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.286
Okay?

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:44.845
Thanks.

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:46.925
You rock.

01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:48.844
- Ha-ha.
- I'm a big fan.

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.651
Thank you.

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.531
Goodbye, 2011!

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.169
New Year's wave!

01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:01.525
Hi. I am Sam Ahern, Jr.

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:03.845
I won't give a long speech.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.368
Socrates gave long speeches
and his friends killed him.

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.209
In the past, my father would
always kick things off...

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.601
...and then turn it over
to the vice presidents...

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.331
...but as you know,
Dad's not with us any more.

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:22.523
I think that anybody that knew him
knows that he was a great man.

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:27.245
And we're thinking
about you tonight, Pops.

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:31.731
He always ended with a quote.

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:36.681
He would say, "What would you do today
if you knew you would not fail?"

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:40.169
And then he'd say,
"Now go out and do it."

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.088
You know where he got that from?

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.646
My mother, Rose Ahern.

01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:53.688
All right, let me finish with this.
As we move forward into this new year...

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.687
...let's try to remember that
sometimes it's okay...

01:25:57.880 --> 01:25:59.564
...to listen to your heart.

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.643
I know it's risky.

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.969
Take that leap of faith.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.403
Happy New Year, everybody.

01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:12.851
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.604
All right, let's do this.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.922
Ladies and gentlemen, Jensen!

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.606
Come here! Why don't you have one on?
Come on!

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.441
<i>I can't turn you loose now</i>

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.127
<i>If I do I'm gonna lose my life</i>

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.601
<i>I'm never turning you loose now</i>

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:49.282
<i>If I do I'm gonna lose my mind</i>

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.886
<i>I can't turn you loose to nobody</i>

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:55.283
<i>'Cause I love you baby
Yes, I do now</i>

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:58.131
<i>Hip-shaking mama, I told ya</i>

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:01.204
<i>Oh, honey, I'm in love with you now</i>

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:03.971
It's okay. They got it.

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:07.044
<i>I wanna give you everything
That you want</i>

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.163
<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta</i>

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:12.369
<i>Keep on lovin', baby</i>

01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.807
<i>Never gonna turn you loose</i>

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:20.484
<i>I gotta keep on
Huh!</i>

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.125
After.

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:39.006
Okay, almost. One more test.
One more test, my darling. Okay.

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:41.128
I get this wire here.

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.850
Uh...

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.047
I got it!

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.682
I put new one inside! Okay, baby!

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.968
- Mwah!
- Does it work?

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:51.963
Flip switch!

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:55.011
I'm flipping. I'm flipping up.

01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:58.367
It's working.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.526
It's going up. It's going up!

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:04.968
Hang on, Kominsky!
Tell Miss Morgan it's working.

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.360
He's got it!

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:12.291
Wait, wait! Get me down first!
First, down!

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:14.488
Coming down! Flipping down!

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.330
Way to go, buddy!

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:18.528
Mr. Kominsky, tell us, how does it feel?

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.842
Well, it feels okay.
Everyone talking at me.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.650
Wade said the mayor called.

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:24.564
- He wants you to come down there.
- Now?

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.405
He thought what you said
a lot of us needed to hear.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.166
Tell Mayor Bloomberg I'd love to.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:37.329
But I have another pressing matter
that needs attending.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:45.089
- Mr. Kominsky?
- Yes.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.642
As a reward for 37 years of service...

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:52.367
...before being temporarily
relieved of your duties...

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:55.251
...I officially hereby leave you in charge.

01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:00.603
What took so long?

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:02.127
Thank you.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.047
Thank you.

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.601
Watch him like a hawk.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.890
You got it. Let me find Nolan
to give you a lift, though.

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:13.724
Officer Nolan's right here.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.490
Hi.

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:20.881
Hi, Tanya.

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.525
Go see your daddy.

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:24.851
Hey, baby.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.525
Hi, Daddy.

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.284
My little rugrats.

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:30.885
Heard you need a lift.

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.441
No. In a car.

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:35.370
Yeah, we have cars too.

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.805
Happy New Year, Brendan.

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.610
Happy New Year, Claire.

01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:42.609
Ah... Alyssa, thank you.

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:45.445
Your favorite, Disaronno and cranberry.

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:48.960
Um... I'm off at 1.

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.331
- I will keep that in mind.
- Okay.

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.560
Hey, Sam.

01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:57.246
- Wendy! How are you?
- Great.

01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:58.890
- You look fantastic.
- Thanks.

01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:00.127
Sam?

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:02.487
- Patty.
- I'd love to be the woman behind you.

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:05.007
And I'd love to be in front.

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.487
Oh. I'm a Sam-wich.

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:12.006
- How's everything? Okay?
- It was wonderful.

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:13.571
- It was delicious.
- Thank you.

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:16.161
I have to say that he was
absolutely right.

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.084
The food is sublime.

01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:21.244
Thank you. Thank you so much.
That's great to hear.

01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:22.606
Who was right?

01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:27.403
Jensen. He told us that we had to hire you
or he wouldn't sing tonight.

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:28.727
Ah.

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:32.362
I'm gonna recommend you to everyone
I know, and, honey, I know a lot of people.

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.165
Thank you.

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:42.370
I'll give you my new condo number
and my new cell.

01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:46.365
You ran out on us last New Year's.
Do you remember that?

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:47.521
Here you go.

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.125
Fun.

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:53.049
You know what? I'm sorry.

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.761
I can't do it. I gotta go.

01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.090
I'm sorry.

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.009
Make a hole, people!

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:24.885
Stan.

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:27.208
It's just me, Aimee.

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:32.241
Please go.
I don't want you to see it happen.

01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.528
No, I'm not gonna leave you alone.

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:35.806
He's not alone.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.091
Hi, Daddy.

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:55.087
Hey. Kiddo.

01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:59.768
Hey, kid.

01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.770
Did we miss it?

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.523
Ball hasn't dropped yet.

01:32:06.120 --> 01:32:07.804
You're really here.

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.085
Yeah.

01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:15.402
Well, my shift is up.

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:18.211
- Have a happy New Year, Aimee.
- Thank you.

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:22.285
- How about some holiday cake?
- Nope. Don't need it.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:26.966
<i>Dessert is now being served.</i>

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:31.971
Chocolate truffles.

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.804
This is working!

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:38.647
- I'm gonna grab some more parachutes.
Okay. We'll keep throwing.

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.968
Throw it at the pretty ones!

01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:45.725
I really would like to speak with you
about Miss Pearlman.

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:47.803
She's not doing too well today.

01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:51.169
She has a high fever, but he didn't
really leave any more orders.

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:54.608
So we really would like you to come in
and take a look at her.

01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:56.364
Thank you, bye.

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:01.126
- So, what do you think?
- Wow.

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:04.011
Somebody's gonna have
a happy New Year.

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:06.801
I sure hope so.

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:09.367
Ha-ha.
- Aimee, Aimee!

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:11.689
Come here. Quick, quick.

01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:15.648
- Mr. Harris isn't in his bed.
- I know.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:18.485
- So should I look for him?
- No. It's okay.

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:19.767
You look hot.

01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.611
I can do this.

01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.965
I can do this.

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:29.128
Hang in there, babydoll.

01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:33.284
We made it on time.

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:35.920
- It's our thing.
- Yeah.

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:39.524
You want me to put you
on my shoulders?

01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:47.208
Wowee-wow.

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:50.364
Where in the world is
the rest of that dress?

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.688
New Year's is all about the dress.

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:55.127
You said that we could change
before dessert.

01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:57.567
There's nothing wrong
in show a little something.

01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:00.007
Trust me, but there's nothing little
about those.

01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:03.562
- What, did one fell off?
- No, no. They didn't fall off.

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:06.326
They are still there.
You look great. Perfect, in fact.

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.403
You mind taking these
parachutes upstairs?

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.210
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:12.727
You're going out there
to celebrate with us?

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:15.400
No. I'll just hang here.

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:18.563
No, it's fine. I'm good.

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:20.404
Okay, I take the parachutes.

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.050
Thank you.

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:33.289
Dr. Steam, to the Ira Keenan lounge.

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:48.921
<i>Hi.</i>

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:50.121
What do you think?

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:54.251
<i>Oh, I love it, I love it.
You look so beautiful</i>

01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.562
<i>I think I need to be there.</i>

01:34:56.760 --> 01:34:59.286
Ha-ha. I think I wish you were.

01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:02.124
Hi, baby.

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:03.967
<i>How've you been?</i>

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:06.445
I'm okay.

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:10.522
<i>The guys are all watching
Times Square on TV right now.</i>

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:13.804
<i>I tell them I'm better off.
I'm watching you.</i>

01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:20.761
I miss you so much.

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:24.927
<i>I miss you too, baby</i>

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.371
<i>I do.</i>

01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:32.163
But you know what?
This is gonna be a great new year...

01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:35.085
...because you're coming home
really soon.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.006
<i>I hope so</i>

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.086
You are.

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:42.288
<i>Yeah. Happy New Year.</i>

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:45.649
Happy New Year.

01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:56.890
Kitchen still open?

01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:01.686
Mm-hm.

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.890
Yep.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.570
For dessert it is.

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:18.208
- Ha-ha.
- We got Jell-O. We got cupcakes, truffles.

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:19.846
Mm.

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:23.761
So you talked Mrs. Ahern
into hiring me tonight, huh?

01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:28.201
Well, I knew you had a lot of other offers
and I wanted you to take this one.

01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:30.601
I really wanted to talk to you.

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:34.404
Well, I'm glad you did.

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.807
I'm glad we had a chance to talk.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:40.566
I'm canceling the tour.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.047
Why?

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:46.641
Because of you.

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:51.847
I'm never gonna leave you again. Ever.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.571
The best decision I made
was asking you to marry me...

01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:57.007
...and the worst decision I made
was sprinting.

01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:00.411
I plan to make it up to you
as long as it takes.

01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:03.690
Well...

01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:09.406
...you do realize that it could be an awfully
long time before I choose to forgive you.

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:13.770
I mean, we could be old and gray
before I choose to forgive you.

01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:15.761
I'll Wait.

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:23.926
It could be years of make-up sex
before I choose to forgive you.

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:25.441
I'll suffer.

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:31.130
It's almost midnight.
You wanna go to a party?

01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:36.168
Let's do it! Please welcome
Mayor Bloomberg, ladies and gentlemen!

01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:39.607
Nice to see you, sir.

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:41.683
- Happy New Year.
- Thank you. Shall we?

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:44.810
I think it's time. Let's drop the ball.
What do you say?

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:47.489
Here we go!

01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:51.290
All right, New York City! Are you ready?!

01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:54.284
One minute to go.

01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:57.444
Let's start the countdown
when we hit 10.

01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:00.007
And here comes the ball.

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:02.721
Uh-huh.

01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:04.291
There it goes.

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.970
Dad, aren't you gonna be cold?

01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:09.488
No, no. There's nothing
like New York air.

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:11.763
Look, there it goes.

01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:18.962
I made so many mistakes.

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.003
You weren't one of them.

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:34.211
Okay, folks, let's start the countdown.

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.010
Ten.

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:39.004
Nine.

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:41.924
Eight.

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.410
Seven.

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:47.324
Six.

01:38:48.560 --> 01:38:49.846
Five.

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:52.690
<i>Four.</i>

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.650
Three.

01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.330
<i>Two.</i>

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:00.527
One.

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:03.047
Happy New Year!

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:28.086
Wait.

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:30.208
If you're here, who's at Times Square?

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:40.446
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:45.561
<i>And never brought to mind?</i>

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:51.727
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:56.403
<i>And auld lang syne?</i>

01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:05.770
<i>And surely you will buy your cup</i>

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:10.608
<i>And surely I'll buy mine</i>

01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:14.242
<i>And we'll take a cup of kindness yet</i>

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:16.329
- You seen Hailey anywhere?
- I haven't.

01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:19.051
I was looking for her and I haven't... Mm.

01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:21.846
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:27.371
<i>We two have run about the slopes</i>

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:32.970
<i>And picked the daisies fine</i>

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:38.604
<i>But we've wandered many a weary foot</i>

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:44.170
<i>Since auld lang syne</i>

01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:49.850
<i>For auld lang syne, my dear</i>

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:55.404
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

01:40:55.560 --> 01:41:00.964
<i>We'll take a cup of kindness yet</i>

01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:06.763
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.844
<i>They're calling me now. We have to go.
But I love you so much.</i>

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:15.168
<i>I think about you all the time.</i>

01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:16.367
I love you.

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:19.570
I love you so much.

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:32.529
<i>We two have paddled in the stream</i>

01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:36.890
<i>From morning sun till night</i>

01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:42.922
<i>But the seas between us broad have roared</i>

01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:47.210
<i>From auld lang syne</i>

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:49.521
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.523
What the hell are you doing?

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.531
I'm twice your age!

01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:56.250
Final resolution.

01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:00.691
Midnight kiss on New Year's Eve.
Boom! Check it off.

01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:05.681
<i>We'll take a cup of kindness yet</i>

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:13.008
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:34.043
<i>Start spreading the news
I'm leaving today</i>

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.565
- I'm fine, Mom.
- You're sure?

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:36.926
I'm sure.

01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.924
You have no idea how worried I was.

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.605
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:43.081
Hailey.
- Hi, Piper.

01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:46.125
- Where have you been?
- You totally freaked us all out.

01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.760
We got passes to the after party
at the Hard Rock.

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:53.244
And Piper's mom, who's been following
us all night, is gonna take us all home.

01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:01.244
Can I go, Mom? Please, please, please.

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:02.885
- Go. Go. Have fun.
- Really?

01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:05.327
- Yes. Have fun. Yes, really.
- For real? Thank you.

01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:07.323
- Do you wanna come with us?
- No.

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:09.448
- I'll pass. I'm good.
- Are you sure?

01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:11.485
You should go to your party.

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:16.771
I love you, Mom. Really.

01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:18.760
I love you too.

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.326
But you're still grounded.

01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:23.846
Yeah, I figured.

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:27.161
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:31.806
Happy New Year, bro. Take care.

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:34.361
All right. Talk to you later, man.

01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:37.404
Text me when you get home
that you got home all right.

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:41.291
Bye! Happy New Year!

01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:53.365
- Hey, Kim, you came for the party.
- Oh, no, I'm just picking something up.

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.807
Hey. You made it.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.562
Whatever. You know,
I saw you kissing Lily Bowman.

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:03.165
Busted.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.843
Can we talk somewhere else?

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:11.886
Come here.

01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:15.330
Look, I'm...

01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:17.011
Hello.

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:21.447
I'm telling you the truth. She grabbed me
and she totally stole it from me.

01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:25.605
Oh, she stole it. Oh, okay, yeah.
That makes just perfect sense.

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:28.366
Well, look, I was just watching
the ball drop and then...

01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:38.005
Whoa.

01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:39.850
Aw...

01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:43.531
Who is that?!

01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:15.169
Would you like to see what we do
on New Year's Eve?

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:20.721
Welcome to the world.

01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:41.685
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:44.603
So you had your baby.

01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:46.685
Congratulations.

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:49.603
- Boy or a girl?
- A boy.

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.171
A boy.

01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:53.647
- You?
- Girl. Third one.

01:45:56.280 --> 01:45:57.645
Exactly at 12:04.

01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:02.126
And yours was when?

01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:08.447
12:05.

01:46:09.360 --> 01:46:10.646
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:15.803
Thank you. Thanks so much.

01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:19.283
12:05 it is, then.

01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:41.205
- Hey. Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:45.850
It's a very good job.
They asked us back for next year.

01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:18.370
You showed up.

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:20.365
You showed up.

01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:24.165
You look beautiful.

01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:27.683
Well, I had a year to get ready.

01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:46.129
<i>- Sometimes it feels like there are so</i>

01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:50.285
<i>Earthquakes, floods, reality shows.</i>

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:53.723
<i>But it's important to remember
the things that we can...</i>

01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:58.807
<i>...like forgiveness, second chances,
fresh starts.</i>

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:03.523
<i>Because the one thing that turns the world
from a lonely place to a beautiful place...</i>

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:05.409
<i>...is love.</i>

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:08.245
<i>Love in any of its forms.</i>

01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:10.243
<i>Love gives us hope.</i>

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:12.402
<i>Hope for the new year.</i>

01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:16.561
<i>Hope...</i>

01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:18.603
<i>...and a great party.</i>

01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:01.682
Don't just dump them!
It should be magical!

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:03.803
Take one.

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:16.688
I've been plotting that slap for years.

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:21.050
How I would just walk up to you
out of the blue... Shit.

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:34.010
I wouldn't want you to be my doctor.

01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:52.327
You think we should...

01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:57.011
You think we should move him
to hospice?

01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:00.448
- Why did you do that to me?
- It's okay, Nurse Aimee.

01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:06.048
- Good one.
- Yeah, good one.

01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:07.366
Cut, cut, cut.

01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:10.842
I... up. I didn't tell her
in the middle of her sentence.

01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:12.724
Go to mark.

01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:22.888
Oh, hey. Hold the elevator.

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:26.882
Baby, things were just heating up!

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:39.126
Oh. Mrs. Baxter.

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:40.646
I mean, Mrs....

01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:42.729
What's your name? Ms. Withers.

01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:47.522
It's midnight. We have to do something
tonight. Get over yourself. Shi... Uh-uh.

01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:51.210
Ooh. Sorry, you're a little late.

01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:23.603
He was in this morning.
He didn't leave orders, and...

01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:29.884
And I may not allow him
in my unit any more.

01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:45.281
Something coming.

01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:47.920
Oh, something coming.

01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:49.810
Oh.

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:51.645
Oh, what do we have here?

01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:54.122
- I think we have twins.
- Oh, my God!

01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:56.681
Oh, you are a goddess.

01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:31.004
That is a wrap!
