(dramatic music)

02:58.133 --> 02:59.733
- All right, here we go.

03:01.880 --> 03:05.620
- We the jury find the
defendant Charlie Paul Sorland

03:06.480 --> 03:09.023
guilty of all charges.

03:10.530 --> 03:12.680
- The witness testimonies we've heard

03:12.680 --> 03:15.530
for your crimes leaves no doubt

03:15.530 --> 03:17.983
in my mind nor in the public's mind.

03:19.069 --> 03:22.620
For the first degree
murder oF Robert Tornim

03:22.620 --> 03:27.213
I hereby sentence you to
death by hydrogen cyanide gas.

03:28.100 --> 03:31.210
For the first degree
murder of Kay Frothington

03:32.120 --> 03:36.833
I hereby sentence you to
death by hydrogen cyanide gas.

03:37.820 --> 03:41.780
For the second degree
murder of Pearl Gladly,

03:41.780 --> 03:44.040
and you got lucky on this one,

03:44.040 --> 03:47.750
I hereby sentence you to 80 years.

03:47.750 --> 03:49.710
You'll be housed at the state prison

03:49.710 --> 03:52.660
until the moment of your last breath.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.130
We can only hope that my hunch of

03:55.130 --> 03:57.610
your responsibility for more victims

03:57.610 --> 04:01.143
than just these three is wrong.

04:02.455 --> 04:05.742
(gavel bangs)

04:05.742 --> 04:08.492
(dramatic music)

06:19.800 --> 06:20.633
- Dr. Sorland.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.983
We've been reviewing your case closely.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.313
As has most of the country.

06:29.550 --> 06:34.550
And I must say it is the
most impressive example

06:34.580 --> 06:37.063
of rehabilitation I've seen in my career.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.443
Perfect conduct record.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.070
The phycology degree as well as the degree

06:44.070 --> 06:47.100
in general education you've
earned while incarcerated.

06:47.100 --> 06:49.610
Is nothing short of miraculous.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.443
- Thank you sir.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.830
- Tell us Charlie what would you do

06:54.830 --> 06:58.440
if we were to grant you a
conditional parol today?

06:58.440 --> 07:01.340
How would you get along out there?

07:01.340 --> 07:04.390
You are the first person
in California history

07:04.390 --> 07:08.530
to survive 50 years while
sitting on two executions.

07:08.530 --> 07:12.683
- Well I'd continue to do
everything I've done in here.

07:12.683 --> 07:14.620
There are 100s of men
out there functioning

07:14.620 --> 07:16.900
as productive members of open society.

07:16.900 --> 07:19.423
Men I helped change
right behind these walls.

07:20.270 --> 07:21.720
I'd aim to make it thousands.

07:23.321 --> 07:25.738
(whispering)

07:34.280 --> 07:36.790
- Dr. Sorland we believe that

07:36.790 --> 07:39.870
what you've done to not only
turn your own life around

07:39.870 --> 07:40.970
but that Midas touch you seem

07:40.970 --> 07:43.543
to have for correcting troubled men.

07:44.490 --> 07:45.540
Probably think you'd be an asset out

07:45.540 --> 07:48.580
there by putting your
abilities to wider use.

07:48.580 --> 07:49.930
What would you say to that?

07:51.580 --> 07:54.393
- I'd be greatly honored sirs, ma'am.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.920
- Of course this would come
with certain provisions.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.010
You may very well end up back here again

08:01.010 --> 08:03.610
with a loss of all the
things you enjoy in here now.

08:04.910 --> 08:06.183
Do you under stand?

08:07.880 --> 08:10.573
Take a detour on the wrong
street without permission,

08:11.460 --> 08:15.800
cozy up to the wrong person and that's it.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.830
- However we will be releasing monies

08:18.830 --> 08:20.090
from the sales of your book

08:20.090 --> 08:22.700
to you for the purpose
of sustaining your self.

08:22.700 --> 08:25.733
So you can give your full
attention to the cause.

08:26.650 --> 08:31.290
I'm going to suggest that
you seek a financial advisor

08:31.290 --> 08:36.290
and a new attorney who specializes
in well I'll just say it

08:39.100 --> 08:41.793
celebrity life styles and situations.

08:42.950 --> 08:44.170
No offense Ralph.

08:44.170 --> 08:45.920
- No offense, thank you your honor.

08:47.090 --> 08:50.690
- We will arrange for some courses for you

08:50.690 --> 08:55.523
to transition you to function
competently in today's world.

08:59.865 --> 09:01.990
- Thank you, thank you.

09:01.990 --> 09:03.723
- Do you have any
questions for us Charlie?

09:05.160 --> 09:06.780
- Not at this time.

09:06.780 --> 09:07.693
- Well I have one.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.320
Could you sign this Dr. Sorland?

09:12.480 --> 09:13.313
This is for a friend of mine

09:13.313 --> 09:14.975
down at the youth detention center.

09:14.975 --> 09:17.558
(gentle music)

09:31.660 --> 09:33.523
- [TV] Kathy, hello?

09:34.550 --> 09:36.633
Hello are you there?

09:38.520 --> 09:39.353
I'm here.

09:41.170 --> 09:45.540
I just wanted to see
her, just one more time

09:45.540 --> 09:48.810
to tell her I'm sorry for
crashing us that night.

09:48.810 --> 09:52.023
I thought I was to tough
to tell her I love her.

09:52.023 --> 09:54.773
(dramatic chord)

09:57.450 --> 10:00.490
- Yeah we're once again here
at Glen Hill's book store

10:00.490 --> 10:04.320
in West Hollywood where
former death row inmate

10:04.320 --> 10:08.120
and recent parolee, Charlie Sorland

10:08.120 --> 10:11.300
also known as the Century city killer

10:11.300 --> 10:16.300
is today signing copies of
his DVD Violence Is Obsolete.

10:16.730 --> 10:17.563
- Yeah, yeah.

10:17.563 --> 10:18.630
- [Charlie] What brings you out here?

10:18.630 --> 10:21.720
- Just your DVD and your book,

10:21.720 --> 10:23.580
and just everything you do is amazing.

10:23.580 --> 10:25.480
- It's a DVD that has become

10:25.480 --> 10:28.410
a very powerful tool with law officers

10:28.410 --> 10:31.780
and school counselors
during the last year or so

10:31.780 --> 10:33.980
as they try to curb the aggressive

10:33.980 --> 10:38.980
behavior of troubled youth
and to reform adult offenders.

10:39.070 --> 10:40.570
And now with the release of the

10:40.570 --> 10:45.570
DVD Dr. Sorland doing a
very different kind of time.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.300
Trying to reach an audience

10:47.300 --> 10:49.070
that thus far law enforcement

10:49.070 --> 10:52.800
sponsored programs have failed to address.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.680
Lots of folks out here today
including Yolanda Washington.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.430
Ms. Washington if I could let me

10:58.430 --> 11:00.077
ask you what brought you out here?

11:00.077 --> 11:02.963
- Charlie Sorland just has to sing my DVD.

11:04.078 --> 11:05.520
I have my son back

11:06.907 --> 11:09.460
and I don't mean I got
my son back from them.

11:09.460 --> 11:13.230
I got my son back, my real son.

11:13.230 --> 11:15.720
The one I always knew he could be

11:15.720 --> 11:17.810
and I owe it all to Charlie.

11:17.810 --> 11:21.200
- So clearly you're okay
with Charlies release.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.033
- Okay?

11:23.240 --> 11:25.740
Okay, his release is the reason why

11:25.740 --> 11:28.670
we're gonna have less
people killing one another.

11:28.670 --> 11:30.430
He's paid his dues.

11:30.430 --> 11:34.350
He set out the truth and
the truth set him free.

11:34.350 --> 11:35.720
- [Mike] We appreciate you talking to us.

11:35.720 --> 11:37.460
That certainly seems to be the case

11:37.460 --> 11:39.220
during a recent news conference

11:39.220 --> 11:41.590
a Los Angeles police
department head quarters

11:41.590 --> 11:45.470
Captain Harry Theabald assured
the public that both he

11:45.470 --> 11:49.010
and the states parol board
have complete confidence

11:49.010 --> 11:50.300
in the effectiveness

11:50.300 --> 11:54.050
of Charlie Sorland's
anti violence program.

11:54.050 --> 11:55.600
A program to which Charlie

11:55.600 --> 11:59.410
has now dedicated nearly
50 years of his life.

11:59.410 --> 12:01.920
Earlier today we spoke to world renown

12:01.920 --> 12:05.207
criminal psychologist
Dr. Kaye Ann Williams

12:05.207 --> 12:07.510
and this is what the doctor had to say.

12:07.510 --> 12:10.601
- And let's not forget the
law enforcement community,

12:10.601 --> 12:12.320
the phycology community

12:12.320 --> 12:14.460
and quite frankly the civil sectors

12:14.460 --> 12:17.330
are firmly behind this landmark decision.

12:17.330 --> 12:19.440
Charlie Sorland began his own,

12:19.440 --> 12:21.610
self imposed rehabilitation

12:21.610 --> 12:25.231
the moment he left that
court room in 1953.

12:25.231 --> 12:27.413
His remorse was well documented

12:27.413 --> 12:29.310
the day of sentencing.

12:29.310 --> 12:31.690
His dedication and strong history

12:31.690 --> 12:33.720
of transforming law breakers

12:33.720 --> 12:36.530
into peace makers cannot be disputed.

12:36.530 --> 12:40.130
After all isn't that the
point of incarceration?

12:40.130 --> 12:43.110
To rehabilitate rather than to discard.

12:43.110 --> 12:48.020
- So there you have it, the
DVD is Violence Is Obsolete.

12:48.020 --> 12:51.930
And now the one time
Century city killer playing

12:51.930 --> 12:56.090
a very different role in West
Hollywood, I'm Mike Watkiss.

12:56.090 --> 12:57.070
We'll throw it back to you.

12:57.070 --> 12:58.653
- What the hell?

13:00.170 --> 13:05.170
This old ass man has been
killing people for 50 years?

13:05.350 --> 13:07.350
- Nah babe, 50 years ago.

13:07.350 --> 13:10.130
This guy, get this, this
guy killed a bunch of people

13:10.130 --> 13:13.980
back in the 1950's or some
shit and got busted for it.

13:13.980 --> 13:16.070
Then he went to prison, he
changed a lot of other people

13:16.070 --> 13:18.760
and himself, now he's famous for it.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.910
- So what did he do?

13:20.910 --> 13:22.773
Go trigger happy or something?

13:24.170 --> 13:27.660
- No get this, he made people
smell the cologne bottle

13:27.660 --> 13:30.290
but it wasn't really
cologne in the bottle,

13:30.290 --> 13:32.323
it was poison fumes from chloroform.

13:33.430 --> 13:35.433
Then when they're knocked the hell out,

13:36.290 --> 13:39.160
he stabs them slowly in the heart one time

13:39.160 --> 13:41.020
so the blood doesn't spatter everywhere

13:41.020 --> 13:43.263
it just kinda gutters out slowly.

13:44.801 --> 13:46.613
And then he takes some
money and the shirt.

13:48.220 --> 13:49.803
- Where you there or something?

13:49.803 --> 13:51.533
How do you know all this?

13:51.533 --> 13:53.715
- [Boy] He talked about
it like a million times.

13:53.715 --> 13:55.627
It's what I've heard in interviews.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.410
- [Woman] Interesting.

13:57.410 --> 14:00.360
- Yo Stitch, Jackie never heard
of the Century city killer.

14:01.970 --> 14:03.320
- Where have you been?

14:03.320 --> 14:05.723
We learned about charming
Charlie back at BCC.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.260
Actually the news was over at

14:08.260 --> 14:10.450
his house he'd been living
at since he got out.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.240
Think it's the second to last house

14:12.240 --> 14:15.710
on Canyon Lake drive before Park Trail.

14:15.710 --> 14:17.060
that status looking number.

14:18.269 --> 14:20.601
- Yeah whatever.

14:20.601 --> 14:24.240
You didn't even finish at BCC's so.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.163
- Cause I learned my own chemistry.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.510
- Jason why do you kick
it with these kids?

14:34.830 --> 14:38.503
You're like older than all of them.

14:40.211 --> 14:41.910
- I went to this frat party once.

14:41.910 --> 14:43.270
- Do you really think the way

14:43.270 --> 14:46.150
he pulled those off will work in 2003?

14:46.150 --> 14:49.340
Don't think so, they got
DNA and everything else now.

14:49.340 --> 14:52.003
Wouldn't make it past the first
body without getting popped.

14:55.370 --> 14:57.820
Yo, you aren't blowing on
Stitch's stash are you?

14:59.039 --> 15:00.690
- No man I'm not trying
to put floor cleaner

15:00.690 --> 15:02.790
in here to rot my teeth out.

15:02.790 --> 15:04.040
I'm all about the powder.

15:05.345 --> 15:06.595
And you got the best man.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.410
- [Man] It's true.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.890
- You know somebody could
just start killing again

15:12.890 --> 15:14.590
in the same style this guy used to

15:15.627 --> 15:16.460
and they might think that since

15:16.460 --> 15:19.400
he's out he's the one doing it again.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.700
- That'd be messed up bro.

15:21.729 --> 15:23.570
- Yeah, for real.

15:23.570 --> 15:24.483
- Yeah, 100.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.160
You uh, really into this
serial killer stuff huh?

15:29.160 --> 15:30.500
Every time I'm here you up in here

15:30.500 --> 15:32.740
watching something about serial killers.

15:32.740 --> 15:34.110
- It's just like the guy was stupid,

15:34.110 --> 15:35.710
I mean that's why he got caught.

15:36.590 --> 15:37.890
I could do it even better.

15:39.130 --> 15:40.960
I mean if I did get
caught at least I'd sell

15:40.960 --> 15:43.839
records out of the deal instead of books.

15:43.839 --> 15:46.256
(chattering)

15:59.566 --> 16:02.720
Yo Stitch hook me up with
some of that chloroform man.

16:02.720 --> 16:03.960
- Chloroform?

16:03.960 --> 16:07.060
What the hell man, You can't
buy that shit since forever.

16:07.060 --> 16:08.943
Besides why buy when you can make?

16:09.930 --> 16:10.763
- Make?

16:11.900 --> 16:12.743
You know how?

16:14.090 --> 16:15.870
- Duh man, it's just some cheap whisky

16:15.870 --> 16:18.490
and chlorinated lime mixed just right.

16:18.490 --> 16:20.283
It smells good and look like water.

16:21.430 --> 16:23.943
Or else you could just
try sweet talking her.

16:25.010 --> 16:26.760
Instead of trying to knock her out.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.222
Take your pick.

16:28.222 --> 16:29.158
- Really?

16:29.158 --> 16:30.116
- Yeah.

16:30.116 --> 16:32.866
(dramatic music)

17:43.273 --> 17:45.480
♪ Tell me what you want ♪

17:45.480 --> 17:46.483
- Hey, hey.

17:47.575 --> 17:50.320
Do you, one of you know where

17:50.320 --> 17:55.320
the after, after, after,
after, after party is?

17:56.918 --> 17:59.168
(chuckles)

18:05.160 --> 18:08.826

18:08.826 --> 18:12.130
♪ Want to do to me ♪

18:12.130 --> 18:15.298
♪ Tell me now let it show ♪

18:15.298 --> 18:17.548
(laughing)

18:19.620 --> 18:20.603
- Another loser.

18:21.780 --> 18:25.393
Hey, don't get caught
pissing in public dude.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.200
- I'm not pissing, I'm nervous.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.960
- Good cause last time I did that

18:30.960 --> 18:32.593
I got 150 dollar fine.

18:34.750 --> 18:35.660
Hey Mia hold up.

18:35.660 --> 18:36.493
- What?

18:36.493 --> 18:37.326
Allie.

18:40.490 --> 18:41.323
Allie.

18:44.420 --> 18:46.524
- Why are you being weird?

18:46.524 --> 18:47.870
- I'm supposed to meet
a girl here tonight.

18:47.870 --> 18:50.770
But I don't exactly look like
my pictures on the internet.

18:52.610 --> 18:55.570
- Oh, you are weird.

18:55.570 --> 18:56.963
- Come on Allie, let's go.

18:57.988 --> 18:59.638
- No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:01.150 --> 19:02.620
- I'm going to get the car,

19:02.620 --> 19:04.420
pull around and you better be ready.

19:05.643 --> 19:06.690
I swear that girl.

19:08.410 --> 19:09.560
- Listen at least tell

19:09.560 --> 19:11.887
me if this cologne smells cheap or not.

19:13.739 --> 19:15.470
(sprits)

19:15.470 --> 19:18.720
(distant upbeat music)

19:56.338 --> 19:59.088
(dramatic music)

20:31.424 --> 20:34.174
(dramatic music)

21:05.518 --> 21:10.518
(engine rumbling)
(eerie music)

21:15.740 --> 21:20.740
(phone ringing)
(eerie music)

21:33.120 --> 21:35.300
- [Man] So the guy was homeless.

21:35.300 --> 21:36.340
Wait a second you're just now

21:36.340 --> 21:38.350
telling us this a whole day later?

21:38.350 --> 21:39.183
Why?

21:40.130 --> 21:42.250
- I wanted to see if maybe
she went home with him

21:42.250 --> 21:44.940
or something, give her time to get back.

21:44.940 --> 21:48.120
She does those kinds of things sometimes.

21:48.120 --> 21:50.570
- In which case he probably
wouldn't be homeless.

21:52.700 --> 21:57.440
- No, I mean he could have
been, he looked like he might be

21:57.440 --> 22:00.510
but he said something to
her about meeting a girl.

22:00.510 --> 22:05.271
He had a cart of junk, he was really odd.

22:05.271 --> 22:07.717
- Did he have anything like a cellphone?

22:07.717 --> 22:08.973
- Not that I saw.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.300
He did have what looked like

22:11.300 --> 22:13.453
a small bottle or something in his hand.

22:14.940 --> 22:16.603
Or maybe it was something else.

22:17.934 --> 22:19.017
I don't know.

22:20.670 --> 22:22.093
I was smashed okay?

22:24.120 --> 22:26.093
- It's okay, calm down.

22:32.200 --> 22:35.870
So other than the shaved
eyebrow, nothing else stood out?

22:35.870 --> 22:38.283
Tattoos, facial hair?

22:39.700 --> 22:43.533
- It was dark and I wasn't
exactly standing next to him.

22:44.530 --> 22:48.723
His arms were covered, his
face was in the dark mostly.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.333
- Okay.

22:52.670 --> 22:53.850
You're not going anywhere soon are you?

22:53.850 --> 22:55.126
I may need you to come back.

22:55.126 --> 22:55.959
(cellphone rings)

22:55.959 --> 22:57.490
Excuse me for one second, I'm sorry.

22:59.410 --> 23:00.243
Detective Lowe.

23:08.019 --> 23:10.295
(sighs)

23:10.295 --> 23:11.128
On my way,

23:13.150 --> 23:17.713
listen I gotta run, we have
each other's information.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.562
Oh Nina.

23:23.562 --> 23:24.400
- [Nina] Yeah what's up?

23:24.400 --> 23:26.810
- [Lowe] Mia, this is Detective Kline.

23:26.810 --> 23:29.020
She'll get more information,
finish up for now.

23:29.020 --> 23:30.640
- Okay but what about?

23:30.640 --> 23:32.190
- [Lowe] We'll be in touch.

23:32.190 --> 23:34.741
In the mean time, be safe out there.

23:34.741 --> 23:39.741
(sirens blaring)
(dramatic music)

23:42.335 --> 23:44.130
- All right but we gotta
get this processed,

23:44.130 --> 23:45.993
tell me what you got.

23:45.993 --> 23:47.563
- I'll be using this.

23:49.070 --> 23:50.244
- Right, good, good, good.

23:50.244 --> 23:55.244
(dramatic music)
(radio chatter)

24:07.446 --> 24:09.410
Good, so we're done here,

24:09.410 --> 24:11.910
I got one over to this
side, one over this side,

24:11.910 --> 24:14.255
I don't know what else, it's
kind of a crazy scene tonight.

24:14.255 --> 24:15.088
- I got it.

24:15.088 --> 24:15.921
- All right.

24:15.921 --> 24:16.754
- Detective Lowe.

24:16.754 --> 24:18.563
I found this in a
dumpster right over there.

24:21.681 --> 24:22.514
- Good job.

24:23.570 --> 24:24.617
Thank you again, appreciate.

24:24.617 --> 24:25.490
- Okay, sure.

24:25.490 --> 24:27.870
- Cassidy, how'd you get here so quick?

24:27.870 --> 24:30.423
- Never mind that, here,
what do you make of this?

24:31.770 --> 24:32.603
- Any ID?

24:33.590 --> 24:34.583
- No not yet.

24:35.580 --> 24:36.413
- Got a purse.

24:37.490 --> 24:39.060
- Well scratch that.

24:39.060 --> 24:39.893
- Thanks.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.903
Ah hell, Allie Gershwin.

24:50.670 --> 24:51.970
- What?

24:51.970 --> 24:53.437
You know her?

24:53.437 --> 24:54.863
- No but I know who she is.

24:59.381 --> 25:01.750
What, what's so funny?

25:01.750 --> 25:02.583
- Allie?

25:06.320 --> 25:07.153
In an alley?

25:10.850 --> 25:12.393
I don't know, sorry.

25:16.250 --> 25:19.520
- This very case ended
up on my desk today.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.463
It was nothing but a missing
party girl until now.

25:23.307 --> 25:27.010
- Hope you can find that son of a bitch.

25:27.010 --> 25:29.760
(dramatic music)

26:11.078 --> 26:13.828
(dramatic music)

27:04.321 --> 27:06.821
(party music)

27:27.560 --> 27:29.240
- Dude last night some chick

27:29.240 --> 27:31.543
was found dead right behind my apartment.

27:34.270 --> 27:35.103
- Whatever dude.

27:35.103 --> 27:36.260
- Seriously.

27:36.260 --> 27:37.750
- No I heard something about that to.

27:37.750 --> 27:40.300
Some dude stabbed a chick
right in her cantaloupes.

27:41.180 --> 27:43.760
- Really?

27:43.760 --> 27:44.920
- For real?

27:44.920 --> 27:46.280
- What a shame.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.860
I mean if she was gonna go out she might

27:48.860 --> 27:50.846
as well have stop at my place on the way.

27:50.846 --> 27:53.320
(chuckles)

27:53.320 --> 27:55.430
- Well maybe she stopped by Jason's.

27:55.430 --> 27:57.683
Somebody test that girl for chloroform.

27:57.683 --> 28:00.297
(laughs)

28:00.297 --> 28:01.400
- What the hell man?

28:01.400 --> 28:02.790
- They did say he had green eyes

28:02.790 --> 28:04.572
and a chin bush, I'm just saying.

28:04.572 --> 28:07.300
(chuckles)

28:07.300 --> 28:08.193
- Any day now.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.460
- All right Sonya's getting
short, let's run this.

28:14.345 --> 28:16.845
(party music)

28:28.210 --> 28:31.560
- Yeah, well those law books
are a real inconvenience,

28:31.560 --> 28:33.910
it's not like there aren't
a half a dozen cameras

28:33.910 --> 28:36.700
in the room at those events,
already logging my face.

28:36.700 --> 28:38.340
- Charlie I know I don't have to say this

28:38.340 --> 28:40.310
but when I advocated your release into

28:40.310 --> 28:41.830
the program we both knew

28:41.830 --> 28:44.593
that there'd be some time
required to satisfy them.

28:45.840 --> 28:46.773
- Yes, I know.

28:48.660 --> 28:51.953
Well here's to my elusive pardon.

28:53.990 --> 28:54.823
- Pardon?

28:57.540 --> 28:58.673
- I'm an optimist.

28:59.540 --> 29:01.127
- Well I'm an optimist to.

29:01.127 --> 29:03.210
(laughs)

29:05.835 --> 29:08.585
(dramatic music)

29:13.525 --> 29:16.470
- But how did you pay for all this?

29:16.470 --> 29:19.320
I know you didn't win
this much from my boys.

29:19.320 --> 29:22.070
(dramatic music)

29:25.590 --> 29:28.385
I know you didn't win this
much money from the boys.

29:28.385 --> 29:31.135
(dramatic music)

29:32.980 --> 29:34.293
But how did this happen?

29:36.580 --> 29:37.413
You?

29:39.350 --> 29:41.100
But how could you pay for all this?

29:42.540 --> 29:44.840
I know you didn't win
this much from the boys.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.730
- Sir, would you like some cologne?

29:47.730 --> 29:50.203
- Man I'm sorry I got, you
know I got this to get.

29:50.203 --> 29:53.360
- Are you sure, it's really
good your * might even like it.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.060
- It's really good stuff.
- Yeah.

29:56.606 --> 29:57.851
- Here you go, check it out.

29:57.851 --> 30:00.601
(dramatic music)

30:24.884 --> 30:26.450
- Here in the Hollywood
hills this morning,

30:26.450 --> 30:28.850
Hollywood Park found the body of well

30:28.850 --> 30:33.370
known celebrity Rodger
Harletin missing shirt

30:33.370 --> 30:36.860
and ID from the scene yet found close by.

30:36.860 --> 30:39.240
Knife wound through the chest cavity

30:39.240 --> 30:40.487
with minimal blood spatter.

30:40.487 --> 30:43.120
(upbeat music)

30:43.120 --> 30:44.303
- Yeah, another one.

30:44.303 --> 30:45.943
He's going high profile now.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.123
He's Rodger Harletin.

30:49.030 --> 30:50.770
- Who the hell's Rodger Harletin?

30:50.770 --> 30:52.827
- You know that actor from
the sitcom about the guy

30:52.827 --> 30:54.141
and his pet raccoon.

30:54.141 --> 30:54.974
(chuckles)

30:54.974 --> 30:56.820
- Oh yeah, that show sucked.

30:56.820 --> 30:59.600
- Yeah same style as the
Gershwin girl in West Hollywood.

30:59.600 --> 31:01.260
And I just got word that
there's one or two more

31:01.260 --> 31:03.480
just like it, one on Fairfax,

31:03.480 --> 31:05.390
the other in Griffith park
over the past couple days.

31:05.390 --> 31:06.573
I'm not liking this.

31:07.780 --> 31:08.950
- Shit.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.410
All right call Jack Howard.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.530
Get with him tomorrow at
the Santa Monica station.

31:12.530 --> 31:14.590
He's dealt with every
major serial in Los Angeles

31:14.590 --> 31:16.090
and Ventura county.

31:16.090 --> 31:17.470
Keep this between you and him,

31:17.470 --> 31:20.150
we don't want the press to get involved.

31:20.150 --> 31:22.410
- Hey while I got ya do you remember

31:22.410 --> 31:25.280
the Charlie Sorland
murders of 1951 to '53?

31:25.280 --> 31:27.233
- Hey watch it, I'm not that old.

31:28.140 --> 31:29.850
- No I mean do you know of them?

31:29.850 --> 31:30.969
This is really bothering me

31:30.969 --> 31:32.210
because if I'm not mistaken

31:32.210 --> 31:34.300
the Century city killer
murders looked just

31:34.300 --> 31:36.570
like this according to
case files we've studied.

31:36.570 --> 31:38.260
The missing shirt, the ID from

31:38.260 --> 31:40.223
the scene yet found easily close by?

31:41.071 --> 31:43.350
The knife through the heart
with minimal blood spatter?

31:43.350 --> 31:45.910
By all accounts a homeless
person always around?

31:45.910 --> 31:49.230
The only thing that was missing
was a bottle of what was it?

31:49.230 --> 31:50.120
Ether or something.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.130
- Chloroform.

31:51.130 --> 31:52.340
I already thought of that.

31:52.340 --> 31:53.710
I've also noticed that
the press hasn't caught

31:53.710 --> 31:54.930
the similarities between him

31:54.930 --> 31:56.870
and old Charlie boys methods.

31:56.870 --> 31:58.470
Thank goodness for that,

31:58.470 --> 32:00.420
no more details outside the department.

32:03.150 --> 32:06.030
- Yeah that's the only
thing that doesn't add up.

32:06.030 --> 32:07.640
- He did have wat looked
like a small bottle

32:07.640 --> 32:08.951
of something in his hand.

32:08.951 --> 32:12.510
- All right well get
him over to toxicology

32:12.510 --> 32:14.753
and get those samples from
the others over there to.

32:15.950 --> 32:17.740
- Will do Cassidy, hey you mind

32:17.740 --> 32:19.340
if we finish this up on the way.

32:20.250 --> 32:21.650
I just thought of something.

32:22.590 --> 32:25.047
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.

32:25.047 --> 32:25.970
Hey are you still working

32:25.970 --> 32:28.440
that undercover homeless meth case?

32:28.440 --> 32:30.900
- No, why do you ask?

32:30.900 --> 32:32.339
- Cause you look like shit.

32:32.339 --> 32:34.589
(chuckles)

32:36.260 --> 32:37.430
- You gonna try to get
some golf in this weekend?

32:37.430 --> 32:40.090
- I'm gonna get some golf in
tonight before the storm hits.

32:40.090 --> 32:41.280
- Yeah this weather changes fast.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.170
- Yeah, all right let's do it.

32:43.170 --> 32:46.100
- [Man] Hey I heard Cassidy's
getting ready to retire?

32:46.100 --> 32:48.140
- [Lowe] Yeah Cassidy is
getting ready to retire

32:48.140 --> 32:50.500
and Lt. Howard I really appreciate

32:50.500 --> 32:52.460
you taking the time to meet with me today.

32:52.460 --> 32:54.100
In spite the weather conditions.

32:54.100 --> 32:54.980
- [Howard] Yeah no problem.

32:54.980 --> 32:56.510
- [Lowe] Yeah, good
resource for me to talk

32:56.510 --> 32:58.160
to about some killings
that have been occurring.

32:58.160 --> 32:58.993
- [Howard] Oh really?

32:58.993 --> 32:59.826
Well okay.

32:59.826 --> 33:02.309
- You may have heard of
them come across the wire.

33:02.309 --> 33:03.813
It's some serious stuff.

33:05.850 --> 33:08.150
Very similar mass IMO to some killings

33:08.150 --> 33:12.980
that took place back in the
50's from Charlie Sorland.

33:12.980 --> 33:14.483
- Charlie Sorland, yeah.

33:15.470 --> 33:16.320
- You know the name?

33:16.320 --> 33:17.350
- I sure do.

33:17.350 --> 33:18.480
- Sargent Cassidy said

33:19.655 --> 33:21.010
that you'd be a good person to talk to.

33:21.010 --> 33:23.850
- It was a very intelligent
man, well studied.

33:23.850 --> 33:27.350
He's definitely someone who
could really help you guys.

33:27.350 --> 33:30.490
I spent a lot of time
working with him back then.

33:30.490 --> 33:31.323
- [Lowe] I wanted to see if

33:31.323 --> 33:32.880
you might be able to provide something.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.460
Insider information.

33:34.460 --> 33:35.810
- [Howard] Yes, I had the opportunity

33:35.810 --> 33:37.368
to work with Dr. Sorland on many cases.

33:37.368 --> 33:40.118
(dramatic music)

34:31.835 --> 34:32.847
(door bell rings)

34:32.847 --> 34:35.597
(dramatic music)

34:42.947 --> 34:45.090
- Hello, Dr. Sorland?

34:45.090 --> 34:47.970
Detective Brent Lowe
with L.A.P.D. Hollywood.

34:50.290 --> 34:54.140
- Now everyone down there is fully aware

34:54.140 --> 34:56.343
I am not to be contacted without

34:56.343 --> 34:59.380
accompaniment of my parol councilor.

34:59.380 --> 35:03.010
- Yes I apologize but this
is an unofficial visit.

35:03.010 --> 35:03.843
Off the record.

35:06.620 --> 35:07.453
Please?

35:22.610 --> 35:24.650
Looks like you're making
the best of your release.

35:24.650 --> 35:28.010
- Yes well the leash is
better than the bars.

35:28.010 --> 35:30.243
The warm sunlight through
the window is better

35:30.243 --> 35:32.170
than the cold blue light

35:32.170 --> 35:35.500
on the concrete ceilings of Alcatraz.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.593
- I thought you were
housed at San Quentin?

35:42.930 --> 35:44.850
- No, that's correct.

35:44.850 --> 35:46.823
Just looking for a little sympathy.

35:50.120 --> 35:50.953
- Dr. Sorland I.

35:50.953 --> 35:53.270
- Charlie, Charlie please.

35:53.270 --> 35:54.760
- Very well then Charlie,

35:54.760 --> 35:55.593
I'm not sure if you're aware

35:55.593 --> 35:57.670
but some things have
occurred over the past week.

35:57.670 --> 35:59.000
Some troubling things.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.860
- There was a girl right?

36:00.860 --> 36:02.633
Allie Gershwin?

36:04.100 --> 36:07.730
Similar to my old modus operandi right?

36:07.730 --> 36:08.563
- You read?

36:09.400 --> 36:12.380
- Yes and although not every aspect

36:12.380 --> 36:14.850
of my old MO was in the news story

36:14.850 --> 36:16.810
I assume it was all

36:16.810 --> 36:19.800
there by your account
which is why you're here.

36:19.800 --> 36:23.030
- That's right, all accept
for Harletin who's shirt

36:23.030 --> 36:24.550
and wallet we couldn't find.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.430
I happened to recognize him.

36:26.430 --> 36:29.180
Now I'm not saying you know
anything but I have to ask.

36:30.420 --> 36:32.160
Do you find it curious that for

36:32.160 --> 36:36.520
the first time since 1953 four murders

36:36.520 --> 36:38.420
this past week have occurred?

36:38.420 --> 36:41.720
in the same area, in the same style?

36:41.720 --> 36:42.553
- Four?

36:42.553 --> 36:43.993
Not just the one girl?

36:44.970 --> 36:47.463
- Remember we're off the record.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.430
Yes, four, three since Allie's,

36:53.430 --> 36:55.160
two the press doesn't know anything about.

36:55.160 --> 36:57.683
Well except for Rodger, he's a big name.

36:58.620 --> 37:01.203
But they don't know all the
details about how it was done.

37:02.950 --> 37:04.070
- Look detective Lowe.

37:04.070 --> 37:05.470
- Brent, please.

37:05.470 --> 37:08.460
- Brent I have something
of a miracle going here,

37:08.460 --> 37:10.310
a unique situation that affords

37:10.310 --> 37:12.420
me to be sitting here right now.

37:12.420 --> 37:15.860
I am 70 years old, I am not about

37:15.860 --> 37:19.290
to jeopardize being free for
the first time in 50 years,

37:19.290 --> 37:20.640
this is so different from me

37:20.640 --> 37:22.430
I don't even know where to begin.

37:22.430 --> 37:23.263
I'm not gonna.

37:23.263 --> 37:25.420
- Charlie, Charlie before I

37:25.420 --> 37:27.823
came here today I checked your log.

37:30.520 --> 37:32.910
I know that you were volunteering at the

37:32.910 --> 37:34.940
Gate Way shelters half way house

37:34.940 --> 37:37.970
off La Brea at the time of Allie's murder.

37:37.970 --> 37:40.580
You were in meetings at
Stine Berg Publishing

37:40.580 --> 37:41.793
at the time of Rodgers.

37:44.410 --> 37:45.890
The time of the murders weren't even

37:45.890 --> 37:47.930
with in several hours reach of you.

37:47.930 --> 37:48.930
You're in the clear.

37:49.807 --> 37:51.943
- Well then why the secret visit?

37:55.380 --> 37:56.900
- I want your help.

37:56.900 --> 37:59.680
- Well I'm always willing
to help, you all know that.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.520
- I mean I want your help.

38:01.520 --> 38:06.520
Not the station, no agencies,
no other authorities.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.783
I mean I want your help personally.

38:10.290 --> 38:13.890
If this gets out it becomes
a commercialized situation.

38:13.890 --> 38:16.240
It'll be like a circus coming to town.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.810
Are you willing to help me?

38:17.810 --> 38:22.290
- So no latten prints?

38:22.290 --> 38:25.940
No fibers, no DNA, no witnesses,

38:25.940 --> 38:28.920
no forensics of any kind to
help you along with this thing?

38:28.920 --> 38:31.680
- To be honest no.

38:31.680 --> 38:34.870
All I have is a description of a man using

38:34.870 --> 38:39.003
what appears to be your
old MO almost exactly.

38:41.910 --> 38:44.883
- So no real evidence to connect anyone.

38:46.340 --> 38:50.810
Well look detective I'm
not an investigator,

38:50.810 --> 38:53.530
now sure I've been active
in the phycology world

38:53.530 --> 38:56.463
and in education but I'm not a cop.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.870
- I don't need your
investigative insights.

38:59.870 --> 39:02.023
- Then what exactly do you need?

39:02.940 --> 39:05.780
- I need you to get into
the mind of this guy.

39:05.780 --> 39:08.590
He's obviously effected by your work.

39:08.590 --> 39:09.483
- Former.

39:11.850 --> 39:14.503
- My apologies, former work.

39:15.550 --> 39:17.260
He's duplicating your old style.

39:17.260 --> 39:20.160
You could work up a profile
and into the head of this guy.

39:21.690 --> 39:22.963
- I don't know.

39:24.210 --> 39:28.120
I do have a penchant for
helping on this side of things

39:28.120 --> 39:30.920
but on that side of things I don't know.

39:30.920 --> 39:33.600
- You'd be working with me and me only.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.320
No official record.

39:35.320 --> 39:36.560
Cassidy wouldn't even know.

39:36.560 --> 39:37.690
- [Charlie] Cassidy?

39:37.690 --> 39:38.623
- My boss.

39:40.200 --> 39:42.470
- Look detective Lowe I have spent

39:42.470 --> 39:45.400
the last 50 years of my life struggling

39:45.400 --> 39:48.960
to dissolve those grains of
sand from life's hour glass.

39:48.960 --> 39:51.260
- But you do that all the time I'm sure.

39:51.260 --> 39:53.460
I mean with your books and your speeches,

39:53.460 --> 39:56.560
those memories are necessary
to do what you need to do,

39:56.560 --> 39:59.660
to say what you need to say,
to help those people out there.

39:59.660 --> 40:01.170
- You're right.

40:01.170 --> 40:03.780
I haven't forgotten
everything which is part

40:03.780 --> 40:06.473
of the equation as to how my system works.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.940
Blessing and a curse it is.

40:09.940 --> 40:12.570
- There are innocent people
are being killed out there

40:12.570 --> 40:16.176
just so some psycho can get
his kicks pretending to be you.

40:16.176 --> 40:18.483
- But if he's not pretending.

40:19.380 --> 40:22.493
There are 100's of well
documented cases like this.

40:23.500 --> 40:26.720
If he actually he believes he is me

40:26.720 --> 40:30.140
then I'm not safe, I need
some serious protection.

40:30.140 --> 40:31.830
- All the more reason.

40:31.830 --> 40:32.943
We can protect you.

40:34.350 --> 40:36.813
- Catching my own copy cat killer?

40:41.473 --> 40:43.473
(sighs)

40:46.000 --> 40:46.963
I'll think on it.

40:47.920 --> 40:49.840
- Wardens and FBI agents have been

40:49.840 --> 40:54.083
trusting your advice for
over 20 years Dr. Sorland.

41:00.770 --> 41:01.853
Here's my card.

41:05.270 --> 41:06.233
I'm up early.

41:09.050 --> 41:11.370
- Detective Lowe how did you connect

41:11.370 --> 41:13.513
the old MO similarities so quickly?

41:16.430 --> 41:18.430
It was a long time ago.

41:18.430 --> 41:21.060
- I'm very familiar with your case sir

41:21.060 --> 41:23.443
and I've studied it even closer lately.

41:31.132 --> 41:32.963
(dramatic music)
- [TV] That's funny,

41:32.963 --> 41:34.736
I think I know why we adopted you.

41:34.736 --> 41:35.803
For your humor.

42:34.888 --> 42:36.738
I guess ignorance comes with the job.

42:37.780 --> 42:39.070
Boston terriers?

42:39.070 --> 42:40.480
A damn pug?

42:40.480 --> 42:42.220
Their french bulldogs man,

42:42.220 --> 42:44.550
can't you tell you hurt a dogs feelings?

42:44.550 --> 42:46.370
- Their feelings or yours?

42:46.370 --> 42:48.360
Do they speak french?

42:48.360 --> 42:51.754
- Hold up, he wants to
know if ya'll speak french,

42:51.754 --> 42:53.415
you got anything to say to him?

42:53.415 --> 42:55.750
Huh, what, what you say?

42:55.750 --> 42:58.547
Hold up, hold up, one at
a time, one at a time.

42:59.530 --> 43:00.363
Yeah.

43:01.703 --> 43:02.960
(french)

43:02.960 --> 43:03.793
- What does that mean?

43:03.793 --> 43:04.626
- Look it up.

43:07.413 --> 43:09.070
So you're the guy I'm
working with now huh?

43:09.070 --> 43:11.220
- Yeah Santos wen tot
another jurisdiction.

43:12.080 --> 43:12.980
He sent you to me.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.550
- All right, here's what up.

43:16.550 --> 43:17.860
I heard jack about them killings

43:17.860 --> 43:20.690
from one of my junkies when
we was at this party last week

43:20.690 --> 43:23.570
and he was talking about
scoring some more blow from me.

43:23.570 --> 43:25.177
News reported about that guy, the old man,

43:25.177 --> 43:27.160
killer that went straight?

43:27.160 --> 43:29.633
Anyways he couldn't let that story go,

43:29.633 --> 43:32.020
soon he started talking to
some other guy about poison

43:32.020 --> 43:33.920
and chemicals and all this shit.

43:33.920 --> 43:36.180
He's a little too into
killers if you ask me.

43:36.180 --> 43:37.450
Maybe he's one of those morbid types

43:37.450 --> 43:39.540
that get off on that type of thing.

43:39.540 --> 43:42.484
- Did he actually say he
was gonna kill someone?

43:42.484 --> 43:43.610
- Nah, I didn't hear straight talk

43:43.610 --> 43:46.849
like that just him being all into it.

43:46.849 --> 43:48.540
I don't know nothing else.

43:48.540 --> 43:50.820
- You're an informant so
where's your information

43:50.820 --> 43:51.940
other than putting someone on the line

43:51.940 --> 43:53.290
for reacting the same way thousands

43:53.290 --> 43:54.300
of other people probably did?

43:54.300 --> 43:55.560
- I don't know, that's all I got.

43:55.560 --> 43:57.090
Take it or leave it.

43:57.090 --> 43:57.923
Damn man.

43:58.940 --> 44:00.200
Sometimes I think this shit isn't

44:00.200 --> 44:02.150
worth it just to keep me out of a cell.

44:04.220 --> 44:06.070
I aint trying to get locked up again.

44:07.850 --> 44:10.150
- Using your own stuff,
the stuff we gave you?

44:11.200 --> 44:13.690
- What the hell man, do
I look like a tweaker?

44:13.690 --> 44:16.433
I don't use, I just sell
like I'm supposed to.

44:17.876 --> 44:19.160
- Why do they call you Fibber?

44:19.160 --> 44:21.063
Do you have a tough
time telling the truth?

44:22.400 --> 44:23.790
- One of those naive, the world

44:23.790 --> 44:25.633
is as it seems, go getter cops.

44:26.690 --> 44:29.020
Nah, it's one of those ironic names

44:29.020 --> 44:31.393
that describes the opposite of actuality.

44:33.110 --> 44:35.230
You know, like a big dog named Tiny,

44:35.230 --> 44:36.410
or a little dog names Zeus.

44:36.410 --> 44:38.810
They call me Fibber but
I always tell the truth.

44:40.880 --> 44:43.040
- So who does that work out for?

44:43.040 --> 44:45.000
Your customers or for us,

44:45.000 --> 44:47.553
because you can't be telling
the truth to both of us.

45:53.380 --> 45:55.880
Detective Brent Lowe, .L.A.P.D.

45:55.880 --> 45:57.593
Mind if I hold you up for a second?

46:00.670 --> 46:01.503
- What's up?

46:03.000 --> 46:04.300
- I know about your habit.

46:07.520 --> 46:10.403
But I'm not concerned about that, relax.

46:11.960 --> 46:13.400
- Why are you here then?

46:13.400 --> 46:15.700
- I'm investigating
somethings in the area,

46:15.700 --> 46:17.113
some very bad things.

46:18.980 --> 46:21.230
I heard you were into
serial killers and stuff.

46:21.230 --> 46:23.240
- Who the fuck have you
been talking to man?

46:23.240 --> 46:25.630
Everybody talks about them,
everybody watches them.

46:25.630 --> 46:27.933
Those forensic crime
shows are hot, so what?

46:29.850 --> 46:30.850
- Let's take a walk.

46:45.630 --> 46:48.130
(door clicks)

46:49.318 --> 46:54.151
- Yo Jackie, we have a visitor,
Detective what's his name.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.093
Don't worry it'll only take a minute.

47:07.160 --> 47:08.210
All right we're here.

47:14.528 --> 47:18.819
- That's yours?

47:18.819 --> 47:20.014
The shirt.

47:20.014 --> 47:21.347
- Yeah, so what?

47:22.280 --> 47:23.730
- Just seems a little big for you,

47:23.730 --> 47:25.920
doesn't seem to fit the whole tough

47:25.920 --> 47:27.960
guy motif you're going for.

47:27.960 --> 47:29.430
- Who in the hell are you
to tell me what I wear

47:29.430 --> 47:30.880
and what I don't?

47:30.880 --> 47:32.620
- I'm not here to tell you anything,

47:32.620 --> 47:34.260
I'm here to ask you something.

47:34.260 --> 47:38.170
Who's your friend you've been
talking to about chemicals?

47:38.170 --> 47:39.443
- What chemicals?

47:40.810 --> 47:41.933
Nobody man.

47:43.030 --> 47:44.810
- I heard your a fan of Charlie.

47:44.810 --> 47:45.803
- Charlie who?

47:48.140 --> 47:51.330
- Look the more you play stupid with me

47:51.330 --> 47:52.770
the more questions I ask.

47:52.770 --> 47:54.900
- Who the hell have you been talking to?

47:54.900 --> 47:56.900
How would you know about any of that huh?

47:56.900 --> 47:57.950
It's just small talk.

47:59.080 --> 48:00.240
Just like everybody else in this city's

48:00.240 --> 48:02.803
probably been doing since
the old man got cut loose.

48:03.860 --> 48:04.820
Don't be putting that shit on TV

48:04.820 --> 48:06.783
if you don't want people talking about it.

48:16.660 --> 48:18.880
- What's that cart used for?

48:18.880 --> 48:21.200
- Groceries and stuff.

48:21.200 --> 48:24.663
I use that store that's
right around the corner.

48:28.420 --> 48:29.253
For shopping.

48:37.610 --> 48:41.380
- Professional Murder Music.

48:41.380 --> 48:44.993
That seems fitting, is that your band?

48:46.170 --> 48:49.020
- No it's a killer band you
wouldn't know anything about.

48:52.900 --> 48:55.150
- Well I guess I'll be heading on my way.

48:55.150 --> 48:57.230
You guys wanna get on my good side

48:57.230 --> 48:58.860
let me know if you hear of any talk.

48:58.860 --> 49:01.910
- Don't wait around for me,
cause I don't know those types.

49:01.910 --> 49:02.830
- You're file Jackie down at

49:02.830 --> 49:04.630
the station might suggest otherwise.

49:18.584 --> 49:20.383
I'll have to check you guys out sometime.

49:21.490 --> 49:23.840
- You've doing enough checking out.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.560
It's not your crowd anyway.

49:25.560 --> 49:29.520
By the way I like your hair the other way

49:29.520 --> 49:31.573
you had it, like in your mug shot.

49:32.920 --> 49:33.920
More suiting for ya.

49:36.520 --> 49:38.417
Well guess I'll see myself out.

49:42.597 --> 49:45.264
(door clatters)

49:48.064 --> 49:49.821
- What was that?

49:49.821 --> 49:51.431
- I don't know.

49:51.431 --> 49:53.353
He's not concerned about the blow though.

49:55.810 --> 49:56.950
Somebody around here has been talking

49:56.950 --> 49:59.960
about too much bullshit
that doesn't even matter.

49:59.960 --> 50:00.793
- Not me.

50:01.790 --> 50:04.010
Stich, Fibber, and what's her face were

50:04.010 --> 50:05.550
the only ones paying attention when

50:05.550 --> 50:08.153
that shit was on the other night.

50:08.153 --> 50:10.820
(TV chattering)

50:27.220 --> 50:29.210
- So how are you on leads?

50:29.210 --> 50:31.530
- I got nothing, nothing solid.

50:31.530 --> 50:35.510
Meanwhile there's another
body found early this morning.

50:35.510 --> 50:37.163
- Same as the others I presume?

50:38.370 --> 50:42.120
- Yeah and the only real lead
I have that has any weight?

50:42.120 --> 50:43.460
Is this guy in a band.

50:43.460 --> 50:45.080
- Why him?

50:45.080 --> 50:49.130
- I got a tip that he had
taken a liking to your case.

50:49.130 --> 50:51.893
Not the guy you are now
but the guy you were.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.940
I went there I saw somethings,

50:55.940 --> 50:57.980
they got my attention
just a little too much.

50:57.980 --> 51:00.370
- Look Detective Lowe
this whole thing may be

51:00.370 --> 51:03.390
way over my head, I don't
see how I can help you.

51:03.390 --> 51:07.260
- Look I can give you full
case reports with evidence,

51:07.260 --> 51:10.280
witness accounts, locations, anything.

51:10.280 --> 51:11.810
- No suspect list though.

51:11.810 --> 51:12.930
- I need a blind work up.

51:12.930 --> 51:16.223
To see if your profile truly matches mine.

51:16.223 --> 51:17.840
- I don't know.

51:17.840 --> 51:20.220
- Look, I'll make this worth your while.

51:20.220 --> 51:23.210
If you can help me get this
guy before he kills again

51:24.610 --> 51:26.770
I can get you a full pardon hearing.

51:26.770 --> 51:28.170
Do you know what that means?

51:29.410 --> 51:32.623
No more parol, no more
looking over your shoulder.

51:33.540 --> 51:36.400
No more watching what
you say or where you go.

51:36.400 --> 51:39.510
You can travel in leisure
without permission or trace.

51:39.510 --> 51:43.993
No more log books, complete
release in the states eyes.

51:45.230 --> 51:47.530
- Well that certainly is tempting.

51:47.530 --> 51:50.720
It's the topic of a lot
of my dreams most nights.

51:50.720 --> 51:52.380
- I can make it happen.

51:52.380 --> 51:56.180
I know people, hell my father

51:56.180 --> 51:57.960
still advises for governor Travers.

51:57.960 --> 52:02.387
- I know, I remember dealing
with your dad back in '84.

52:04.060 --> 52:05.203
How is he by the way.

52:06.100 --> 52:07.683
- He's good, thanks.

52:08.860 --> 52:10.160
Good enough to back me up.

52:11.700 --> 52:12.533
What do you say?

52:14.085 --> 52:16.085
(sighs)

52:18.080 --> 52:20.860
All right I'll put together
this case report for ya

52:20.860 --> 52:22.573
and get you on your way.

52:22.573 --> 52:24.823
(rustling)

52:46.018 --> 52:47.768
Here you go kind sir.

52:49.200 --> 52:51.200
Think everything you need's right there.

52:52.200 --> 52:53.525
Let's see if we can catch this guy.

52:53.525 --> 52:56.275
(dramatic music)

53:11.156 --> 53:13.906
(dramatic music)

53:16.252 --> 53:17.717
- Hey Paule, get a sound check going,

53:17.717 --> 53:18.969
I'm gonna go outside for a minute.

53:18.969 --> 53:21.969
(suspenseful music)

53:32.413 --> 53:33.246
- Hey.

53:33.246 --> 53:36.246
(suspenseful music)

53:57.465 --> 53:58.569
Yeah?

53:58.569 --> 54:01.319
(dramatic music)

54:15.096 --> 54:17.719
(phone rings)

54:17.719 --> 54:19.270
- Brent Lowe.

54:19.270 --> 54:20.620
- Detective Lowe, sorry to catch you

54:20.620 --> 54:21.540
at the end of your night,

54:21.540 --> 54:24.830
we have a 187 behind the pub
Night Rock club on Sunset

54:24.830 --> 54:26.393
and Orange, can you dispatch?

54:28.460 --> 54:29.560
- I'll be right there.

54:33.275 --> 54:35.858
(upbeat music)

54:39.210 --> 54:41.670
- It's finished, all alone at the scene.

54:41.670 --> 54:44.900
Very little external
bleeding, most precise yet,

54:44.900 --> 54:49.086
no collateral injuries, only a
struggle, though superficial.

58:10.133 --> 58:10.966
- What you running for?

58:10.966 --> 58:12.460
- Cause you're gonna try to point your gun

58:12.460 --> 58:13.810
and pop me in front of everybody.

58:13.810 --> 58:16.090
No I wasn't I was gonna
pull out my cellphone

58:16.090 --> 58:18.140
and call my guys to guard all the doors

58:18.140 --> 58:20.490
so you couldn't run before I had a chance

58:20.490 --> 58:22.480
to question you bout another damn murder

58:22.480 --> 58:25.030
that happened right behind
the drum set over there.

58:28.822 --> 58:30.100
- I don't know anything.

58:30.100 --> 58:31.590
- Yeah, you just happen to be here at

58:31.590 --> 58:33.640
the exact time that somebody got killed

58:33.640 --> 58:36.113
in the same style that
you've been killing them.

58:36.113 --> 58:37.363
- I didn't do it.

58:37.363 --> 58:39.163
- I got witnesses who saw you there.

58:40.000 --> 58:41.070
- You don't have any witnesses saying

58:41.070 --> 58:43.580
this song would kill
anyone though do ya, huh?

58:43.580 --> 58:44.780
Do ya?

58:44.780 --> 58:47.600
Yeah course I'm here, my bands playing.

58:47.600 --> 58:51.610
Yeah and I have witnesses
saying I was here all night.

58:51.610 --> 58:53.203
Jenny Valenor.

58:54.400 --> 58:55.630
- Who?

58:55.630 --> 58:58.193
- That's her name, she had a life.

58:59.430 --> 59:03.263
We found a bottle that
didn't smell quite right.

59:04.260 --> 59:07.280
And when the prints, blood, skin samples,

59:07.280 --> 59:09.730
or even a flick of dandruff come back on

59:09.730 --> 59:13.663
that bottle or on her and it's yours?

59:15.894 --> 59:17.644
Well have a good set.

59:22.275 --> 59:25.025
(dramatic music)

59:40.126 --> 59:42.876
(dramatic music)

1:00:28.278 --> 1:00:31.550
- After going over everything
here's the profile.

1:00:31.550 --> 1:00:33.640
I'm not making any promises

1:00:34.530 --> 1:00:37.883
but I think it's about as
viable as any that I've done.

1:00:40.980 --> 1:00:42.400
- Male, of course.

1:00:42.400 --> 1:00:45.740
Late 20s to late 30s,
I'm with you on that.

1:00:45.740 --> 1:00:48.853
Lives in a busy area of the
city, probably not suburbanite.

1:00:50.330 --> 1:00:53.513
May have knowledge of chemistry
or access to a chemist.

1:00:55.260 --> 1:01:00.130
Charlie, so parallel to
my own profile, obvious

1:01:00.130 --> 1:01:01.710
and safe at best.

1:01:01.710 --> 1:01:02.543
- Turn the page.

1:01:09.710 --> 1:01:11.290
- Probably colored hair

1:01:11.290 --> 1:01:14.490
and other alterations to
his body or appearance

1:01:14.490 --> 1:01:18.863
to hide who he used to be, or
to become who he never was.

1:01:21.690 --> 1:01:24.003
An artist such as an actor or musician.

1:01:27.470 --> 1:01:30.620
What led you to this part about
appearance and artist type?

1:01:30.620 --> 1:01:33.123
- 70 years experience in being me.

1:01:34.090 --> 1:01:38.340
Sadly I don't believe our guy

1:01:38.340 --> 1:01:41.350
ever killed anyone before these events.

1:01:41.350 --> 1:01:43.900
And that makes me feel sorrow

1:01:43.900 --> 1:01:46.440
and guilty with a portion of the blame,

1:01:46.440 --> 1:01:48.820
I don't think he ever
would have killed anyone

1:01:48.820 --> 1:01:52.863
had it not been for his
exposure to my unfortunate tale.

1:01:53.920 --> 1:01:56.623
- You're not gonna believe
this but I have a prime.

1:01:57.780 --> 1:02:00.200
He fits the profile to a T.

1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:01.550
Not only his profile

1:02:01.550 --> 1:02:04.693
but the circumstantial
evidence is near overwhelming.

1:02:06.130 --> 1:02:08.720
If I brought this guy in for questioning

1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:10.420
would you sit in on the interview?

1:02:13.010 --> 1:02:14.160
- All right I'll do it.

1:02:20.127 --> 1:02:22.127
Mhm, right, Dr. Williams

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.423
this is completely out of my wheel house.

1:02:27.830 --> 1:02:30.220
So, no I admit, I admit when I was down

1:02:30.220 --> 1:02:33.550
at that station I snuck
a peak at this guys file

1:02:33.550 --> 1:02:36.263
and I gotta say after seeing what I saw.

1:02:37.170 --> 1:02:38.273
He could be the one.

1:02:41.490 --> 1:02:43.810
No I would never, no.

1:02:43.810 --> 1:02:47.960
- No everything in this case
points to you and no one else.

1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:51.220
Not a single person is on
my radar except for you.

1:02:51.220 --> 1:02:52.300
Why is that?

1:02:56.180 --> 1:02:58.010
- Maybe you're attracted to me.

1:02:58.010 --> 1:03:00.210
You like brunettes, should I have my head

1:03:00.210 --> 1:03:01.460
and bring you outta heat?

1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:10.060
Ironic, you're trying to bust me for

1:03:10.060 --> 1:03:12.260
the very thing you wanna
do to me right now.

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:15.240
What's the matter,

1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:16.970
run out of kids to pick
on back in high school

1:03:16.970 --> 1:03:19.273
so you go get your badge
so you can continue it?

1:03:32.820 --> 1:03:35.560
- I have a blind criminal profile work up

1:03:35.560 --> 1:03:37.970
of the Century city killer copycat done

1:03:37.970 --> 1:03:40.650
by a well respected criminal psychologist

1:03:40.650 --> 1:03:44.313
who knows a thing or to
about people like you.

1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:49.983
Do you wanna what type
of guy he came up with?

1:03:52.050 --> 1:03:52.883
- Enlighten me.

1:03:58.710 --> 1:04:02.390
- You to a T, not by name

1:04:02.390 --> 1:04:07.390
but by description of who
you are and what you do.

1:04:10.960 --> 1:04:13.403
And believe me he knows your kind.

1:04:16.367 --> 1:04:17.667
- Well he sounds charming.

1:04:22.910 --> 1:04:25.423
That's it, Charming Charlie.

1:04:26.390 --> 1:04:27.593
The man himself.

1:04:31.623 --> 1:04:33.723
Well I've been watching him real close to.

1:04:35.380 --> 1:04:38.163
So he did the profile huh, on me?

1:04:43.350 --> 1:04:46.243
Charlie, Charlie.

1:04:48.414 --> 1:04:49.814
Can I get a picture with ya?

1:04:52.550 --> 1:04:56.523
So you drag me in here based
on a maniacal killers words.

1:04:58.560 --> 1:05:01.073
Man can I go now?

1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:10.090
The next time you think of
harassing me I'm getting a lawyer

1:05:11.556 --> 1:05:13.810
and I'll have you on the new so fast,

1:05:13.810 --> 1:05:16.340
faster than you can change your mind.

1:05:16.340 --> 1:05:18.310
I mean a big case like this would

1:05:18.310 --> 1:05:20.453
get a huge cover story on the news right?

1:05:22.290 --> 1:05:23.123
I'm outta here.

1:05:46.280 --> 1:05:49.050
- I could easily get a warrant
for a home search for drugs.

1:05:49.050 --> 1:05:51.650
I could hold him for that,
it would buy me some time

1:05:52.690 --> 1:05:57.210
but he could raise this up,
make everything crumble.

1:05:57.210 --> 1:05:58.150
This whole thing between me

1:05:58.150 --> 1:06:01.883
and you, it would be a PR
suicide for the department.

1:06:02.980 --> 1:06:04.420
- Well how about surveillance?

1:06:04.420 --> 1:06:05.810
- I could do that but if anyone

1:06:05.810 --> 1:06:07.773
in the circle catches on even one time?

1:06:09.490 --> 1:06:12.343
- Right, how sure are
you that he's the one?

1:06:13.790 --> 1:06:14.623
- About 80.

1:06:16.200 --> 1:06:18.450
- All right now I know
this sounds sacrificial

1:06:18.450 --> 1:06:23.450
but maybe we wait, see
if another body turns up.

1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:26.840
He may be scared straight now knowing

1:06:26.840 --> 1:06:27.870
that you're all over him

1:06:27.870 --> 1:06:31.100
he might just consider
it a win at this point,

1:06:31.100 --> 1:06:32.113
cut himself out.

1:06:33.230 --> 1:06:35.250
- Yeah but I could put together case

1:06:35.250 --> 1:06:37.848
enough to charge him for
the victims we do have.

1:06:37.848 --> 1:06:39.250
(knocks)

1:06:39.250 --> 1:06:40.083
Yeah?

1:06:42.440 --> 1:06:44.637
Detective Dougan, I
thought you were off today?

1:06:44.637 --> 1:06:46.553
- Not with the stacks on my desk.

1:06:53.650 --> 1:06:55.990
- If you make it to Sunset my seven

1:06:55.990 --> 1:06:58.013
you can stop Molly from going to heaven.

1:07:01.250 --> 1:07:02.853
- I wasn't expecting that.

1:07:08.840 --> 1:07:11.760
Look can you pull up a census sheet

1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:14.820
on everyone named Molly between Wilshire

1:07:14.820 --> 1:07:17.583
and Hollywood Boulevard
and Santi and Normandie?

1:07:18.500 --> 1:07:20.363
- Yeah, I could do that.

1:07:21.860 --> 1:07:23.609
- Good luck detective.

1:07:23.609 --> 1:07:25.405
- I'll let you know what happens.

1:07:25.405 --> 1:07:26.875
- [Jason] What gives man?

1:07:26.875 --> 1:07:28.614
Something aint right.

1:07:28.614 --> 1:07:31.031
You're laying low, what's up?

1:07:32.245 --> 1:07:33.828
I'm talking to you.

1:07:36.739 --> 1:07:38.720
- What you talking about my dude?

1:07:38.720 --> 1:07:40.550
- I got cops all over my
ass talking about stuff

1:07:40.550 --> 1:07:42.000
that nobody should know about

1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:45.430
accept for Jackie, Stitch, me and you.

1:07:45.430 --> 1:07:48.170
- Good, that leaves me out
then cause I aint to snitch

1:07:48.170 --> 1:07:49.363
and I aint no bitch.

1:07:53.740 --> 1:07:55.530
- You got me that shook shook?

1:07:55.530 --> 1:07:56.923
- Soon, real soon.

1:07:58.114 --> 1:08:00.120
And I should make you pay
double just for this shit,

1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:02.070
you're lucky I got restraint.

1:08:02.070 --> 1:08:04.250
Calling me trying to punk me out.

1:08:04.250 --> 1:08:06.553
If I was the old me you would
have got touched already.

1:08:08.130 --> 1:08:09.493
Aren't you supposed to be
locked up or something?

1:08:09.493 --> 1:08:11.770
- What would I be locked up for?

1:08:11.770 --> 1:08:13.890
What's that supposed to mean?

1:08:13.890 --> 1:08:15.700
- Man these cops man, they
be hovering around here,

1:08:15.700 --> 1:08:18.270
knocking off everybody for petty bullshit.

1:08:18.270 --> 1:08:19.483
- Obviously I'm not.

1:08:21.060 --> 1:08:23.390
- Okay, all right man
I got stuff to deliver,

1:08:23.390 --> 1:08:25.260
you messing up my business.

1:08:25.260 --> 1:08:27.430
I'm a get your stuff asap
so be at your crib in a bit.

1:08:27.430 --> 1:08:29.490
- Yeah whatever, I'm gonna get my car,

1:08:29.490 --> 1:08:30.923
I gotta go somewhere first.

1:08:34.358 --> 1:08:36.525
(rustles)

1:08:41.488 --> 1:08:44.238
(dramatic music)

1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:47.540
- Okay I'd like to ask
you a few questions.

1:08:47.540 --> 1:08:48.373
- [Woman] Yeah.

1:08:48.373 --> 1:08:49.920
- How long you been smelling
the smell over there?

1:08:49.920 --> 1:08:50.753
- About a week.

1:08:50.753 --> 1:08:52.100
- About a week, okay.

1:08:52.100 --> 1:08:53.947
Ms. Paulison I appreciate you bringing

1:08:53.947 --> 1:08:55.050
(phone ringing)
this to our attention

1:08:55.050 --> 1:08:56.460
we're gonna have a unit out to investigate

1:08:56.460 --> 1:08:57.310
it as soon as we can

1:08:57.310 --> 1:09:00.270
and do you mind if I
take this for a quick,

1:09:00.270 --> 1:09:02.290
I'm sorry I'll just be a minute.

1:09:02.290 --> 1:09:03.123
- Okay of course.

1:09:03.123 --> 1:09:04.440
- I appreciate it, thank you.

1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:09.230
Yup, yup.

1:09:09.230 --> 1:09:10.930
- Any info on the Molly situation.

1:09:11.900 --> 1:09:14.570
- Yeah I got six unharmed, ready to go.

1:09:14.570 --> 1:09:16.470
- That's exactly what I need to hear.

1:09:16.470 --> 1:09:17.620
- Yeah, I'll have all 13 Molly's

1:09:17.620 --> 1:09:18.590
in that perimeter rounded up

1:09:18.590 --> 1:09:21.423
and taken to my house,
you know, for safety.

1:09:23.250 --> 1:09:25.343
- What's the missus
gonna think about that?

1:09:26.380 --> 1:09:28.623
- All right I'll have them
brought to the station.

1:09:29.820 --> 1:09:30.653
- Tell those black

1:09:30.653 --> 1:09:33.180
and whites not to over
patrol, we need discretion.

1:09:33.180 --> 1:09:35.900
- Oh suddenly you're the
one giving orders now?

1:09:35.900 --> 1:09:36.733
You know you're gonna make a nice

1:09:36.733 --> 1:09:39.380
replacement for me when
I'm gone next year.

1:09:39.380 --> 1:09:41.130
- Nobody could replace you Cassidy.

1:09:42.580 --> 1:09:43.593
- All right, 104.

1:13:01.020 --> 1:13:01.853
- Who's Molly?

1:13:01.853 --> 1:13:02.853
- Molly the fuck who?

1:13:02.853 --> 1:13:03.686
(smacks)

1:13:03.686 --> 1:13:05.140
- Don't play anymore stupid
than you already are,

1:13:05.140 --> 1:13:06.913
who's Molly and where is she?

1:13:08.230 --> 1:13:09.910
- I don't know anything.

1:13:09.910 --> 1:13:11.660
- You been sending me FAX's lately?

1:13:13.200 --> 1:13:17.460
- Yeah I have, I got one coming
in for you just right now.

1:13:17.460 --> 1:13:19.496
(spits)

1:13:19.496 --> 1:13:21.579
(whacks)

1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:24.350
- I'm working on your alibis.

1:13:24.350 --> 1:13:25.997
One of them is gonna come up flat.

1:13:25.997 --> 1:13:27.770
And when that happens, I'm gonna find

1:13:27.770 --> 1:13:29.920
the holes in the others,
you can bet on it.

1:13:31.002 --> 1:13:32.373
- Well don't hold your breath.

1:13:33.950 --> 1:13:36.243
Yeah you're already out
of breath, look at ya.

1:13:37.100 --> 1:13:39.341
- I get two legal hours to hold you

1:13:39.341 --> 1:13:41.410
and I'm gonna do it right now.

1:13:41.410 --> 1:13:43.060
Yeah, let's say till after seven.

1:13:44.810 --> 1:13:45.890
- I knew it.

1:13:45.890 --> 1:13:47.490
- You knew what you little punk?

1:13:48.620 --> 1:13:49.963
- I knew you were a fag.

1:13:52.140 --> 1:13:53.913
- Let's go, you're coming with me.

1:13:55.590 --> 1:13:56.616
Punk.

1:13:56.616 --> 1:13:59.366
(cuffs clicking)

1:14:00.350 --> 1:14:01.520
I'll be sure to give my beautiful wife

1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:03.101
the message, let's go.

1:14:03.101 --> 1:14:03.934
- Yeah.

1:14:07.390 --> 1:14:10.830
Hey Cassidy, yeah we're
half way back to my car now.

1:14:10.830 --> 1:14:12.780
- How do his alibis look?

1:14:12.780 --> 1:14:14.940
You've got no wiggle room,
you can't hold him right now.

1:14:14.940 --> 1:14:15.773
You got nothing.

1:14:16.713 --> 1:14:18.360
- He was just off Sunset.

1:14:18.360 --> 1:14:21.450
Right where I thought
he'd be, it's too perfect.

1:14:21.450 --> 1:14:24.862
You got nothing but trouble
coming our way, let him go.

1:14:24.862 --> 1:14:26.700
- He has drug paraphernalia at his house,

1:14:26.700 --> 1:14:28.170
I can hold him for that.

1:14:28.170 --> 1:14:29.003
- Well then you're looking

1:14:29.003 --> 1:14:31.570
at probation in a few years at best.

1:14:31.570 --> 1:14:33.470
If you really think this is the right guy,

1:14:33.470 --> 1:14:35.713
you gotta be in it for the big haul.

1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:37.953
- Dammit.

1:14:42.384 --> 1:14:44.467
(knocks)

1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:50.420
- If there's so much as
one girl with one hair

1:14:50.420 --> 1:14:52.340
out of place tonight I'm coming

1:14:52.340 --> 1:14:55.123
for you myself without a badge.

1:14:57.750 --> 1:14:59.260
Got it?

1:14:59.260 --> 1:15:00.133
Now get up.

1:15:02.874 --> 1:15:05.498
(cuffs clicking)

1:15:05.498 --> 1:15:08.248
(dramatic music)

1:15:28.090 --> 1:15:29.720
- Hey baby, what's up?

1:15:32.440 --> 1:15:34.170
- They always come around.

1:15:34.170 --> 1:15:35.580
- Yes we sure do.

1:15:35.580 --> 1:15:37.277
- So what's it gonna be?

1:15:37.277 --> 1:15:40.223
- Oh I don't know let
me see what I got on me.

1:15:41.828 --> 1:15:43.639
Oh look at that.

1:15:43.639 --> 1:15:45.600
(chuckles)

1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:46.877
Hey where ya going honey?

1:15:46.877 --> 1:15:48.960
(laughs)

1:15:51.270 --> 1:15:52.153
I love this job.

1:15:54.300 --> 1:15:57.050
(dramatic music)

1:16:22.220 --> 1:16:24.860
- Jason, where have you been?

1:16:24.860 --> 1:16:27.833
Stitch has your candy and Fibber
has the money for the show.

1:16:29.150 --> 1:16:32.163
I also have something for you.

1:16:34.533 --> 1:16:36.084
I think you're going to like it.

1:16:36.084 --> 1:16:37.122
- That's great baby, can't wait

1:16:37.122 --> 1:16:41.609
but it'll have to wait I got
something I gotta do first.

1:16:41.609 --> 1:16:42.685
(car door bangs)
(dramatic music)

1:16:42.685 --> 1:16:47.685
(engine rumbling)
(dramatic music)

1:16:53.461 --> 1:16:56.211
(dramatic music)

1:16:59.831 --> 1:17:02.331
(tense music)

1:17:15.600 --> 1:17:20.517
(crying out)
(tense music)

1:18:02.557 --> 1:18:05.224
(water running)

1:18:06.127 --> 1:18:08.627
(tense music)

1:18:24.784 --> 1:18:26.231
(knife clatters)

1:18:26.231 --> 1:18:29.064
(plastic rustles)

1:18:33.407 --> 1:18:34.603
- Sit on your hands.

1:18:35.890 --> 1:18:37.623
Sit on your hands.

1:18:44.230 --> 1:18:45.063
- What is this?

1:18:48.770 --> 1:18:50.110
You.

1:18:50.110 --> 1:18:54.683
- Whoa look what the cat dragged in.

1:18:56.930 --> 1:18:58.520
- Why?

1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:03.520
- To know you've still got
it, that is age defying.

1:19:03.880 --> 1:19:05.600
I must say when I learned

1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:10.320
of those first two murders I was flattered

1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:15.320
but then the competitive
side of me just came out.

1:19:16.930 --> 1:19:21.083
Quite frankly I can't have
you cluttering up my legacy.

1:19:22.290 --> 1:19:24.283
I can't have you stealing my thunder.

1:19:25.780 --> 1:19:26.613
- Molly?

1:19:28.580 --> 1:19:31.700
- Prahket, Molly Prahket.

1:19:31.700 --> 1:19:33.093
- you're messed up old man.

1:19:34.890 --> 1:19:36.300
- To think that one can send

1:19:36.300 --> 1:19:39.080
a picture like that from a mailing store.

1:19:39.080 --> 1:19:42.510
It's a shame even my warning to our friend

1:19:42.510 --> 1:19:46.167
Detective Lowe couldn't save
Molly from going to heaven.

1:19:50.230 --> 1:19:55.083
Oh I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1:19:57.180 --> 1:20:01.490
There's Molly, Melisa Myers
at Melrose and Fiarfax.

1:20:01.490 --> 1:20:04.013
Steve Windra, Griffith park.

1:20:05.210 --> 1:20:10.210
Karl Ravishaun, he is an Easter egg.

1:20:10.570 --> 1:20:12.800
Still undiscovered it seems

1:20:12.800 --> 1:20:14.650
and Jenny Valenore at the night club.

1:20:16.320 --> 1:20:17.153
You're turn.

1:20:19.460 --> 1:20:22.370
- Allie Gershwin, 101 on Vine.

1:20:22.370 --> 1:20:23.910
- Mhm.

1:20:23.910 --> 1:20:24.943
- Reggie Harletin.

1:20:27.930 --> 1:20:28.793
Mulholland.

1:20:29.880 --> 1:20:32.683
- That's right, all acounted for.

1:20:34.140 --> 1:20:39.140
You're two to my five,
or your three to my four.

1:20:41.210 --> 1:20:46.210
I bested you, barely, you bag
a big star in Rodger Harletin.

1:20:48.770 --> 1:20:51.373
I'll give you double points for him.

1:20:53.190 --> 1:20:54.510
- But.

1:20:54.510 --> 1:20:55.343
- Hands.

1:20:57.791 --> 1:21:01.564
Hands.

1:21:01.564 --> 1:21:04.397
(engine rumbling)

1:21:16.352 --> 1:21:19.102
(car door bangs)

1:21:25.520 --> 1:21:30.520
- How did you do Jenny,
what's her name, Valenor?

1:21:30.650 --> 1:21:35.650
- Oh about her, she was
just too good to pass up.

1:21:36.100 --> 1:21:38.540
When I saw you throw away your bottle

1:21:38.540 --> 1:21:40.690
in the dumpster signifying

1:21:40.690 --> 1:21:43.480
what, that you'd taken
yourself out of the game.

1:21:43.480 --> 1:21:46.230
(dramatic music)

1:21:57.230 --> 1:22:00.030
I knew the cops would have
you on the hook for that one.

1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:02.763
I had to take the freebie.

1:22:04.890 --> 1:22:06.783
- I always thought you'd be smarter.

1:22:07.974 --> 1:22:09.073
- Oh I am.

1:22:11.395 --> 1:22:12.353
- That cop Lowe?

1:22:13.610 --> 1:22:14.873
He's looking for this.

1:22:16.050 --> 1:22:17.725
You're done now.

1:22:17.725 --> 1:22:20.725
(suspenseful music)

1:22:30.290 --> 1:22:32.973
- Oh I might be if I were like you.

1:22:34.157 --> 1:22:38.750
A two dimensional thinker,
just cause and effect.

1:22:38.750 --> 1:22:42.130
See in three dimensions I can improvise

1:22:42.130 --> 1:22:44.833
yet unpredictable scenarios
like this one here.

1:22:45.810 --> 1:22:48.363
Puts me inside your head.

1:22:49.910 --> 1:22:53.710
Your showing up now means you'll be famous

1:22:53.710 --> 1:22:58.370
for all seven jobs just as you fantasized.

1:22:58.370 --> 1:23:03.370
Plus you need to be stopped
and I need my full pardon.

1:23:03.645 --> 1:23:05.490
(knocks)

1:23:05.490 --> 1:23:06.323
- Charlie.

1:23:07.540 --> 1:23:08.403
- Pardon me.

1:23:10.600 --> 1:23:11.433
Pun intended.

1:23:12.520 --> 1:23:13.743
Doors open detective.

1:23:18.740 --> 1:23:20.673
- Charlie put down the gun.

1:23:31.559 --> 1:23:33.823
What the hell?

1:23:33.823 --> 1:23:34.770
What happened here?

1:23:34.770 --> 1:23:37.380
- He brought this into my home.

1:23:37.380 --> 1:23:41.070
He held me at knife point, made
me watch while he did this.

1:23:41.070 --> 1:23:44.990
Luckily for me he was so,

1:23:44.990 --> 1:23:48.420
so sickly entranced I was
able to get my protection.

1:23:48.420 --> 1:23:50.550
I know, I know, I know it's a violation

1:23:50.550 --> 1:23:52.260
of my terms to have a gun

1:23:52.260 --> 1:23:54.910
but after this man began
killing with my name

1:23:54.910 --> 1:23:57.460
on his victims I just had to assume I'd

1:23:57.460 --> 1:24:00.033
be facing a sinister
situation at some point.

1:24:00.033 --> 1:24:02.230
I'm sorry, I apologize detective.

1:24:02.230 --> 1:24:03.420
- He's lying.

1:24:03.420 --> 1:24:04.793
He did all this.

1:24:07.940 --> 1:24:11.120
All right I admit it, I did the first two

1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:12.443
but he did the rest.

1:24:13.620 --> 1:24:14.530
Check them out.

1:24:14.530 --> 1:24:19.060
- Well the knife in the clothes
will tell the tale Jason.

1:24:19.060 --> 1:24:20.863
He's a poor soul, that boy.

1:24:24.280 --> 1:24:25.113
- Get up.

1:24:26.315 --> 1:24:27.865
Put your hands above your head.

1:24:30.080 --> 1:24:31.053
Do it slowly.

1:24:51.739 --> 1:24:56.739
(dramatic music)
(cuffs clicking)

1:25:03.191 --> 1:25:06.441
- They're gonna find out, believe that.

1:25:07.710 --> 1:25:10.153
- Dr. Sorland you need
to come with us sir.

1:25:10.153 --> 1:25:13.325
This is a hot crime scene,
we can't have you in here.

1:25:13.325 --> 1:25:18.325
(dramatic music)
(chattering)

1:25:27.409 --> 1:25:30.159
(dramatic music)

1:25:42.008 --> 1:25:45.980
- You know he admires me
for all the wrong things

1:25:45.980 --> 1:25:50.263
I've done and detests me for
all the right I've done since.

1:25:51.886 --> 1:25:52.936
Can you believe that?

1:25:59.596 --> 1:26:01.370
- I was recently told I
was naive for believing

1:26:01.370 --> 1:26:02.620
the world is as it seems.

1:26:09.160 --> 1:26:10.250
I'm sorry Dr. Sorland

1:26:11.542 --> 1:26:12.375
but we wouldn't have found

1:26:12.375 --> 1:26:14.123
that poor girl if it wasn't for you.

1:26:18.260 --> 1:26:22.310
It's finished, I know this didn't end

1:26:22.310 --> 1:26:24.110
the way either of us imagined it to.

1:26:25.508 --> 1:26:28.713
- Well I can't take all the credit.

1:26:32.490 --> 1:26:33.910
- I'll work on that pardon.

1:26:33.910 --> 1:26:36.220
It looks like my Sargent
Cassidy just arrived,

1:26:36.220 --> 1:26:38.120
he'll work on your processing

1:26:38.120 --> 1:26:40.400
and they're gonna clean things up.

1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:41.933
You take care Dr. Sorland.

1:26:46.549 --> 1:26:47.966
- Detective Lowe.

1:26:49.201 --> 1:26:51.618
Hey brent got another minute?
