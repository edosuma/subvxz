00:20.170 --> 00:22.170
[cheers and applause]

00:22.170 --> 00:25.199
- From the Penn & Teller
Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:25.199 --> 00:28.199
here's our host--
Alyson Hannigan!

00:28.199 --> 00:31.199
[cheers and applause]

â™ª â™ª

00:37.070 --> 00:41.000
[cheers and applause]

00:41.000 --> 00:43.869
- Welcome to
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

00:43.869 --> 00:46.770
We're here to see some of
the best magicians in the world

00:46.770 --> 00:49.070
try to fool two
of magic's finest,

00:49.070 --> 00:50.600
Penn and Teller.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.600
Anyone who pulls it off
earns a spot

00:52.600 --> 00:54.770
in their long-running
Vegas show.

00:54.770 --> 00:58.700
And now, the magicians with
the strength of two men

00:58.700 --> 01:00.130
and the voice of one,

01:00.130 --> 01:01.869
Penn and Teller!

01:01.869 --> 01:04.870
[cheers and applause]

01:04.870 --> 01:07.870
â™ª â™ª

01:11.730 --> 01:14.730
[cheers and applause]

01:18.500 --> 01:23.069
Okay, it's time to meet our
first potential fooler.

01:23.069 --> 01:25.069
[explosion booms]

01:25.069 --> 01:27.230
- My name is Elliot Zimet,
I am an illusionist,

01:27.230 --> 01:29.569
and I'm from the Bronx
in New York City.

01:29.569 --> 01:31.030
[techno music]

01:31.030 --> 01:32.530
Coming to my show
is an experience.

01:32.530 --> 01:34.670
It's high energy.
There's beautiful women.

01:34.670 --> 01:35.870
There's exotic birds.

01:35.870 --> 01:37.069
This ain't your mama's magic.

01:37.069 --> 01:39.000
â™ª â™ª

01:39.000 --> 01:41.329
I used to tell the promoters
never to announce

01:41.329 --> 01:43.000
that I'm an illusionist
at the show,

01:43.000 --> 01:45.099
so when I walk on stage
and look like a music artist,

01:45.099 --> 01:46.900
people would think
I'm going to sing,

01:46.900 --> 01:49.500
and the microphone didn't work,
so I threw it in the audience

01:49.500 --> 01:53.000
and in midair,
it changed into a bird.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.900
The routine I'm doing
for this show

01:54.900 --> 01:58.700
is a classical magic, but I
added in lots of surprises.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.829
There's always possibility
of messing up,

02:00.829 --> 02:03.599
but I just hope to
impress Penn and Teller

02:03.599 --> 02:06.370
with my style of magic.

02:06.370 --> 02:08.830
[cheers and applause]

02:08.830 --> 02:12.030
- Our next performer prefers
not to be introduced

02:12.030 --> 02:14.030
as a magician or illusionist,

02:14.030 --> 02:17.329
so please welcome this guy,
Elliot Zimet.

02:17.329 --> 02:20.569
[cheers and applause]

02:20.569 --> 02:21.870
[knocking]

02:21.870 --> 02:24.000
- Got a delivery.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.599

02:48.670 --> 02:50.870

that seeing is believing...

02:50.870 --> 02:53.870
â™ª â™ª

02:53.870 --> 02:54.870
but is it?

02:54.870 --> 02:57.199
â™ª â™ª

02:57.199 --> 03:01.099
You know, right now,
I feel like I'm flying.

03:01.099 --> 03:03.500
But am I?

03:03.500 --> 03:06.099
And then I spot
this girl in the crowd...

03:06.099 --> 03:09.099
and I noticed my feet
are still planted here.

03:10.370 --> 03:12.169
Man, she looks like
a heartbreaker.

03:12.169 --> 03:15.199
You know,
a little dangerous.

03:15.199 --> 03:18.199

07:10.899 --> 07:12.370
- Wow!

07:12.370 --> 07:15.730
Elliot Zimet,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.069
Hi!

07:17.069 --> 07:19.329
That's for you.
- Hi, Alyson.

07:19.329 --> 07:20.899
- That's incredible.

07:20.899 --> 07:24.730
So you're sort of, like, part
magician, part rock star.

07:24.730 --> 07:26.399
- Trying to figure it out,
myself.

07:26.399 --> 07:28.029
- I think it's working,
whatever it is.

07:28.029 --> 07:30.029
It's really, really
entertaining.

07:30.029 --> 07:31.670
- Thank you so much.
- Yes.

07:31.670 --> 07:34.500
So where do you get
your inspiration from?

07:34.500 --> 07:36.500
- Yeah, like you said--
I love concerts.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.029
You said rock star,
I love concerts,

07:38.029 --> 07:39.600
hip-hop, rock,
whatever it is.

07:39.600 --> 07:43.000
I'm a big Usher, Rhianna,
Kanye West fan.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.329
So the look, the lights,
the costumes, the energy,

07:46.329 --> 07:48.829
the connection with
the audience is most important.

07:48.829 --> 07:50.000
- That's so cool.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.500
- So that's kind of my thing.
- Yeah.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.100
Well, I think the boys
are done with their chitchat.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.500
- Elliot, my new friend.
- Yes.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.829
Uh, really good.

07:58.829 --> 08:03.600
We love the fact that
everybody who does origami

08:03.600 --> 08:06.100
usually uses,
you know, swords.

08:06.100 --> 08:10.199
But you're completely
non-motivated, unjustified,

08:10.199 --> 08:11.899
out of the blue, you know?

08:11.899 --> 08:12.899
It just, uh...

08:12.899 --> 08:14.170
no reason for it.

08:14.170 --> 08:17.029
Using the broken mirror
and the pieces looks great.

08:17.029 --> 08:18.930
It really is a really,
really good idea.

08:18.930 --> 08:20.870
We know this theater
inside out,

08:20.870 --> 08:22.899
and we know it so well,

08:22.899 --> 08:25.199
that we know
your trick is harder

08:25.199 --> 08:27.269
than people at home
may think it is.

08:27.269 --> 08:31.269
People at home may think,
well, this is a big theater

08:31.269 --> 08:35.000
in Vegas, it is probably maggoty
with trap doors.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
There's probably trap doors
everywhere on that stage.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
And we happen to know that,
on that stage,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.899
there is one gigantic
trap door

08:42.899 --> 08:44.669
that you could bring
a car in and out.

08:44.669 --> 08:47.700
But it's not sneaky at all,
you can't do anything on it.

08:47.700 --> 08:50.370
So you did that
without trap doors.

08:50.370 --> 08:53.100
So what you actually
did was harder

08:53.100 --> 08:54.700
than many people
at home may think.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.000
We know the whole
layout of this,

08:56.000 --> 08:57.700
and know how fast
you moved around.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.870
So once we've eliminated
trap doors,

08:59.870 --> 09:01.899
which is what everybody else
would think it is,

09:01.899 --> 09:03.870
there's really only
one place at one time

09:03.870 --> 09:06.529
you could have done it,
and we know what that is.

09:06.529 --> 09:08.230
But it was a great switch.
- Thank you so much.

09:08.230 --> 09:10.029
- [laughs]
- Thank you.

09:10.029 --> 09:13.070
- Well, so you're confident that
you didn't fool Penn and Teller,

09:13.070 --> 09:15.500
but you certainly
entertained us all.

09:15.500 --> 09:16.899
- I'm so happy.
- Yes.

09:16.899 --> 09:18.200
- What a pleasure,
thank you so much.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.730
- Okay, it's great, man.
- Thank you.

09:19.730 --> 09:22.100
Elliot Zimet,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:22.100 --> 09:23.029
[cheers and applause]

09:23.029 --> 09:25.929
Thank you so much.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.200
More magic on the way,
but first,

09:29.200 --> 09:30.870
let's catch our breath.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.429
More "Fool Us" after this.

09:32.429 --> 09:35.429
[jazz music]

09:35.429 --> 09:37.269
â™ª â™ª

09:42.100 --> 09:45.100
[jazz music]

09:45.100 --> 09:48.429
[cheers and applause]

09:48.429 --> 09:50.870
- Welcome back to
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us,"

09:50.870 --> 09:54.169
where magicians try to
hoodwink our in-house Houdinis.

09:54.169 --> 09:56.269
Let's meet our next trickster.

09:56.269 --> 09:59.230
[explosion booms]

09:59.230 --> 10:02.370
- My dad inspired me
to have a career in magic.

10:02.370 --> 10:05.000
â™ª â™ª

10:05.000 --> 10:06.899
He did these homemade movies.

10:06.899 --> 10:08.870
He would call them
"crazy shots."

10:08.870 --> 10:11.899
And they all had
a magical quality to them.

10:11.899 --> 10:13.169
They were kind of
practical jokes,

10:13.169 --> 10:15.070
and sometimes I was
the butt of the joke.

10:15.070 --> 10:16.330
â™ª â™ª

10:16.330 --> 10:17.830
I do a good
cups and balls routine

10:17.830 --> 10:19.929
that involves
the element of sound.

10:19.929 --> 10:21.899
The steel balls came about
because I found

10:21.899 --> 10:24.230
a steel ball bearing
in my dad's toolbox.

10:24.230 --> 10:26.100
The magicians were
impressed by the fact

10:26.100 --> 10:28.669
that I was fooling them
with sight and with sound

10:28.669 --> 10:30.000
at the same time.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.200
Magicians,
they're not often fooled.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.000
Because they know the secrets.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.700
And what you do is,
you sort of try to

10:35.700 --> 10:38.769
use the information
against them.

10:38.769 --> 10:40.830
Fooling other magicians
was a way of

10:40.830 --> 10:43.429
carrying on my father's life.

10:43.429 --> 10:46.429
[cheers and applause]

10:48.269 --> 10:51.929
- Please welcome
Paul Gertner.

10:51.929 --> 10:53.600
- Thank you.
Thank you.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.830
Thank you.

10:54.830 --> 10:57.899
Alyson, would you mind
joining me at the table?

10:57.899 --> 11:00.470
I have a trick that you've
never seen before,

11:00.470 --> 11:01.830
and I want you to
see it up close.

11:01.830 --> 11:03.500
- I would love to, thank you.
- Okay.

11:03.500 --> 11:07.029
Now, Penn and Teller,
it's a pleasure to be here.

11:07.029 --> 11:09.029
And I brought something special
to show you.

11:09.029 --> 11:11.000
It might even look
a little familiar,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.529
because I brought a deck
of marked cards.

11:13.529 --> 11:14.600
[laughter]

11:14.600 --> 11:16.000
You see, Alyson,
Penn and Teller

11:16.000 --> 11:18.070
know an awful lot
about marked cards.

11:18.070 --> 11:21.330
And they would tell you that,
of course, most magicians

11:21.330 --> 11:23.700
mark the cards on the back.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.700
However, I mark them
a little differently.

11:25.700 --> 11:28.429
I mark them on the edge.
Yeah.

11:28.429 --> 11:30.000
See, you can see
on the edge of the deck,

11:30.000 --> 11:31.870
it's like a little pattern.

11:31.870 --> 11:33.169
Like a barcode pattern.

11:33.169 --> 11:35.029
There's information there,
you just don't know

11:35.029 --> 11:36.029
how to read it.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.200
And I'm gonna
teach you right now.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.700
- Oh, thank you.

11:38.700 --> 11:42.830
- Now, I actually marked each
card with this permanent marker.

11:42.830 --> 11:44.529
And that's important,
because each card has

11:44.529 --> 11:46.769
a unique code on it,
but it's permanent,

11:46.769 --> 11:49.899
and I can't alter it
or change it in any manner.

11:49.899 --> 11:52.570
Now, if you take
a look at the cards,

11:52.570 --> 11:54.200
Alyson, I want you to confirm
for everybody

11:54.200 --> 11:55.500
that all the cards
are mixed up.

11:55.500 --> 11:56.769
In other words,
they're not all

11:56.769 --> 11:58.230
the red cards here
and black cards here.

11:58.230 --> 11:59.830
It's a shuffled pack
of cards, right?

11:59.830 --> 12:01.100
- Yes.

12:01.100 --> 12:04.200
- And I'm going to begin
by actually having you

12:04.200 --> 12:05.230
select a card.

12:05.230 --> 12:06.269
- Okay.
- So, as--

12:06.269 --> 12:08.169
now, this works with
any card in the deck.

12:08.169 --> 12:10.100
so I want you to
choose one at random.

12:10.100 --> 12:12.029
So just say "stop"
as I riffle the pack.

12:12.029 --> 12:13.870
- Stop.
- Okay.

12:13.870 --> 12:15.029
Look at the card.

12:15.029 --> 12:16.029
Remember the name
of the card.

12:16.029 --> 12:17.169
Okay?

12:17.169 --> 12:18.700
And we'll let
Penn and Teller see it.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.230
I'm going to place it
in the pack.

12:20.230 --> 12:22.600
And normally,
at this point in the card trick,

12:22.600 --> 12:26.230
the magician squares up the deck
and shuffles the card.

12:26.230 --> 12:27.269
Right, guys?

12:27.269 --> 12:30.070
Yeah, that's Magic 101.

12:30.070 --> 12:31.529
But I'm not
going to do that.

12:31.529 --> 12:35.529
I'm going to give these cards
what we call an "un-shuffle."

12:35.529 --> 12:38.169
Now, it's the opposite
of a shuffle.

12:38.169 --> 12:40.830
In fact, if you take
a close look right here,

12:40.830 --> 12:45.029
I'm going to show you that you
can see it looks like a shuffle,

12:45.029 --> 12:49.169
it sounds like a shuffle,
but it's actually an un-shuffle.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.929
And if you watch the marks
on the edge of the deck,

12:51.929 --> 12:54.600
You'll see it starting to read

12:54.600 --> 12:58.929
"un-shuffled" four times
on the side of the pack.

12:58.929 --> 13:00.070
See?

13:00.070 --> 13:02.200
Because I'm actually--
un-shuffled these cards

13:02.200 --> 13:04.070
into four different groups.

13:04.070 --> 13:06.330
Hearts, clubs, spades,
and diamonds--

13:06.330 --> 13:08.169
the four suits in the deck.

13:08.169 --> 13:09.000
Yeah.

13:09.000 --> 13:13.330
But if I give the cards
another un-shuffle,

13:13.330 --> 13:15.169
just like this...

13:15.169 --> 13:18.669
and you can see, when I give
the cards an un-shuffle,

13:18.669 --> 13:21.070
it looks like a shuffle,
it sounds like a shuffle,

13:21.070 --> 13:22.070
but it's not.

13:22.070 --> 13:24.000
That's an un-shuffle.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.070
And, in fact, take a look.

13:25.070 --> 13:28.500
It's now starting to read
"un-shuffled"

13:28.500 --> 13:30.899
two times on the side
of the deck.

13:30.899 --> 13:33.200
Because I've now separated
all the high cards

13:33.200 --> 13:34.429
from all the low cards.

13:34.429 --> 13:35.570
[laughter]

13:35.570 --> 13:36.899
Yeah.

13:36.899 --> 13:40.000
But it gets even more
interesting if I give the cards

13:40.000 --> 13:42.769
one more un-shuffle.

13:42.769 --> 13:45.570
And if I do it, I want you to
stare at the edge of the deck

13:45.570 --> 13:48.000
and see if you can tell the
moment that these cards

13:48.000 --> 13:49.330
become...

13:49.330 --> 13:51.200
[audience gasps]

13:51.200 --> 13:52.330
Un-shuffled.

13:52.330 --> 13:55.000
[applause]

13:55.000 --> 13:56.269
Oh, but...

13:56.269 --> 14:00.129
but, Alyson, if it says
un-shuffled,

14:00.129 --> 14:01.600
I have to prove it.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.529
Remember in the beginning,
I showed you they were

14:03.529 --> 14:05.000
all mixed up?

14:05.000 --> 14:07.899
Take a look at them now,
because from the ace

14:07.899 --> 14:09.029
through the king of hearts--

14:09.029 --> 14:10.169
- What?

14:10.169 --> 14:12.870
- Of clubs, of diamonds,
of spades,

14:12.870 --> 14:15.200
it's a completely
un-shuffled deck of cards.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.070
- Oh, my gosh.
- Thank you.

14:17.070 --> 14:18.230
- Wow!
- Thank you.

14:18.230 --> 14:20.269
[applause]

14:20.269 --> 14:21.929
Oh, wait, wait.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.070
There's one minor detail.

14:24.070 --> 14:25.500
In the beginning,
you selected a card.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.830
- Yeah.

14:26.830 --> 14:29.029
- And it's somewhere here
in this un-shuffled deck.

14:29.029 --> 14:32.070
Now, I could look
for your card faceup.

14:32.070 --> 14:33.830
But they're all in sequence.

14:33.830 --> 14:35.169
Perfect order.

14:35.169 --> 14:37.070
That wouldn't be
too difficult to find

14:37.070 --> 14:39.899
and, besides, it probably
wouldn't fool Penn and Teller.

14:39.899 --> 14:42.929
But if I found your card
facedown,

14:42.929 --> 14:45.029
it would be a little more
impressive.

14:45.029 --> 14:46.730
For the first time,
tell me and everyone else

14:46.730 --> 14:48.769
what was the name
of your card?

14:48.769 --> 14:51.669
- Uh, the king of spades.

14:51.669 --> 14:54.429
If I give the cards
one more un-shuffle,

14:54.429 --> 14:57.669
and if I re-arrange almost
every card in the pack,

14:57.669 --> 14:59.529
except for the top
and bottom cards,

14:59.529 --> 15:01.070
I think I can hit it.

15:01.070 --> 15:02.370
And I did.

15:02.370 --> 15:03.570
There it is.

15:03.570 --> 15:06.700
Your king of spades.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.169
Thank you.
Thank you.

15:08.169 --> 15:11.830
[cheers and applause]

15:11.830 --> 15:14.100
Penn?

15:14.100 --> 15:16.000
And Teller?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.070
I think it's pretty clear
at this point,

15:18.070 --> 15:21.200
I can find any card
in this deck I want to find.

15:21.200 --> 15:24.830
And I can also put these cards
in almost any order I want them.

15:24.830 --> 15:28.870
Look, if I give them
one more un-shuffle,

15:28.870 --> 15:32.529
take a look at now,
the cards have been separated.

15:32.529 --> 15:36.169
All the red cards
and all the black cards.

15:36.169 --> 15:40.769
So there's really only
one final question to answer.

15:40.769 --> 15:43.000
And that is...

15:43.000 --> 15:47.870
did I fool Penn...

15:47.870 --> 15:49.169
- [gasps]

15:49.169 --> 15:50.269
- And Teller?

15:50.269 --> 15:54.529
[cheers and applause]

15:54.529 --> 15:57.029
Thank you.
- Ladies and gentlemen--

15:57.029 --> 15:59.100
- Thank you.
- Paul Gertner.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.730
Whoa!
- [laughs]

16:00.730 --> 16:02.000
- That was incredible!
- Thank you.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
- Oh, my God!

16:03.000 --> 16:04.830
[applause]

16:04.830 --> 16:07.200
Now, that is a trick
that you know

16:07.200 --> 16:09.230
Penn has asked you
about, or--

16:09.230 --> 16:11.070
- That's the tricky part.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.070
Penn bought my book
a number of years ago

16:13.070 --> 16:14.000
to learn that trick.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.070
In fact,
I saved his email.

16:16.070 --> 16:18.899
I still have his email.
- Oh, that's so cool.

16:18.899 --> 16:21.429
- So you did a trick that
you know Penn knows.

16:21.429 --> 16:23.600
- Uh, yes, that's true.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.669
But there was a little
twist at the end

16:25.669 --> 16:27.370
that I think might've
made them smile.

16:27.370 --> 16:29.769
- Okay, and now how do you
come up with, like,

16:29.769 --> 16:31.029
the little change?

16:31.029 --> 16:32.669
Are you just, like,
driving down the street

16:32.669 --> 16:34.570
and you're like,
"Ah, wait a second, I got it."

16:34.570 --> 16:37.100
- No, that took about
ten days of thinking,

16:37.100 --> 16:39.029
and about another week
of preparation,

16:39.029 --> 16:40.600
and then another week
showing it to the top

16:40.600 --> 16:42.169
slight of hand artists
in the world.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.169
- Oh, wow.
- Okay?

16:43.169 --> 16:47.169
- On video to say,
"is this gonna work?"

16:47.169 --> 16:48.669
- Yes.
- Keep my fingers crossed here.

16:48.669 --> 16:50.200
I don't know.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.029
- All right, that was
a wonderful performance.

16:53.029 --> 16:54.830
Let's see what
Penn and Teller think.

16:54.830 --> 16:56.000
- Okay.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.330
- Gentlemen with
the notebooks.

16:59.330 --> 17:04.368
- I want to say first,
before we get to the hard part,

17:04.368 --> 17:09.200
uh, I am a huge fan
of Paul Gertner's.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.269
Huge fan.
- Thank you.

17:10.269 --> 17:12.430
[applause]

17:12.430 --> 17:14.200
- Penn, did you hear him?

17:14.200 --> 17:16.569
You were deliberating,
but he saved your email

17:16.569 --> 17:17.868
that you wrote
to him years ago.

17:17.868 --> 17:19.200
- Well, I did buy
the book from him.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.200
And worked forever,
and I'm not gonna even

17:22.200 --> 17:24.829
give one word of
how that's done,

17:24.829 --> 17:27.000
because he knows that
I read the book

17:27.000 --> 17:28.269
and he knows that
I worked on it.

17:28.269 --> 17:31.170
And I think he also knows
I failed.

17:31.170 --> 17:34.170
I never got good enough
at it to perform it.

17:34.170 --> 17:35.930
But I'm not dead yet.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.569
- Okay.
- I'm gonna keep working.

17:37.569 --> 17:39.769
Uh, so it's only the ending
we're talking about,

17:39.769 --> 17:43.069
when the Penn and Teller
comes into view at the end

17:43.069 --> 17:45.930
it kind of, uh,
blew our minds.

17:45.930 --> 17:49.170
And we think it's the same
deck of cards he started with.

17:49.170 --> 17:51.369
I'll also go out
with that.

17:51.369 --> 17:55.000
We don't think he did anything
big and gross on that,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.529
even though he's got a table
the size of an apartment.

17:57.529 --> 17:59.000
- That's true, I could have.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.970
- We don't think
he did anything there.

18:00.970 --> 18:04.000
So we then have two choices
for what he did,

18:04.000 --> 18:06.200
and I'm gonna ask this
in two different ways.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.269
Um, one is, uh...

18:09.269 --> 18:10.730
can we look at the cards?

18:10.730 --> 18:12.900
- Can you--you mean
look at the cards that--

18:12.900 --> 18:14.069
- You used, yeah.

18:14.069 --> 18:16.369
- Yeah, I mean,
they'll tell you something,

18:16.369 --> 18:19.000
but not a whole--
not all of them, sure.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.230
- 'Cause we think--uh,
I'll tell you, before this--

18:21.230 --> 18:23.069
- Look at Teller's face.

18:23.069 --> 18:25.200
- Uh, well, it says, uh...

18:25.200 --> 18:27.200
- It says Penn and Teller.
- Penn is inspecting the props.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.829
- Pretty clearly.

18:28.829 --> 18:31.029
And, uh...

18:31.029 --> 18:33.730
if we do that,
and we do that,

18:33.730 --> 18:34.869
- Teller looks very excited.

18:34.869 --> 18:37.029
- We get nothing,
and we do this...

18:37.029 --> 18:38.029
- Hello?

18:38.029 --> 18:39.529
- Yeah, well,
actually, it does.

18:39.529 --> 18:41.930
Uh, we did learn
something from this deck.

18:41.930 --> 18:44.230
I don't know if you can
see the angle on this, Paul.

18:44.230 --> 18:47.069
But if you look--I don't want to
screw up your whole deck,

18:47.069 --> 18:50.529
but if I do a shuffle
like this...

18:50.529 --> 18:52.170
I want you to just
watch the edge.

18:52.170 --> 18:54.029
I think you'll see it
come into focus.

18:54.029 --> 18:57.599
It says, "Paul Gertner,
you fooled us."

18:57.599 --> 18:59.930
- [laughs]
- Yay!

18:59.930 --> 19:02.029
You fooled them!

19:02.029 --> 19:03.329
- At the exact
right angle.

19:03.329 --> 19:05.529
[cheers and applause]

19:05.529 --> 19:06.569
Beautiful.
- Thank you.

19:06.569 --> 19:09.000
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.930
- Oh, that's wonderful.
- Thanks, Penn.

19:11.930 --> 19:14.829
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Paul Gertner!

19:14.829 --> 19:17.269
[cheers and applause]

19:17.269 --> 19:19.599
That's one fooler already,
and we have

19:19.599 --> 19:21.200
more magicians
on the way.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.500
Can lightning strike
twice tonight?

19:23.500 --> 19:25.230
Come back and find out.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.700
[cheers and applause]

19:27.700 --> 19:30.099
[jazz music]

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
[jazz music]

19:38.000 --> 19:40.500
[cheers and applause]

19:40.500 --> 19:43.029
- Welcome back to
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

19:43.029 --> 19:45.200
We've already had
one successful fooler.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.900
Is there another in the house?

19:46.900 --> 19:50.029
Let's find out as we meet
our next magician.

19:50.029 --> 19:52.170
[explosion booms]

19:52.170 --> 19:55.069
- I always knew I was never
going to be a serious magician.

19:55.069 --> 19:57.869
Far too uncoordinated
and not attractive enough.

19:57.869 --> 20:00.829
Play to your strengths,
always play to your strengths.

20:00.829 --> 20:03.500
My interest in magic comes
largely from my great-uncle.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.200
At family get-togethers,
he would come by and eat fire.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.670
â™ª â™ª

20:07.670 --> 20:09.029
I'm from Toronto, Canada.

20:09.029 --> 20:10.930
What are Canadian people like?

20:10.930 --> 20:12.829
I've tried to do a little bit
of good in the world.

20:12.829 --> 20:15.099
I do a show called
"Mosquitoes Suck."

20:15.099 --> 20:17.400
We raise money
for people in Africa

20:17.400 --> 20:20.029
who are suffering
with malaria.

20:20.029 --> 20:21.500
If I could fool
Penn and Teller,

20:21.500 --> 20:24.029
I will politely apologize,
because that is

20:24.029 --> 20:25.029
the Canadian way.

20:25.029 --> 20:27.170
â™ª â™ª

20:27.170 --> 20:31.869
[cheers and applause]

20:31.869 --> 20:34.599
- Joined by five
randomly selected members

20:34.599 --> 20:38.099
of our audience,
please welcome Matt Disero.

20:38.099 --> 20:39.069
[cheers and applause]

20:39.069 --> 20:41.200
- Thank you.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.529
Thank you very much.

20:42.529 --> 20:46.430
Normally, you see psychics on
TV, these fake psychics on TV.

20:46.430 --> 20:48.000
And they know girls'
phone numbers,

20:48.000 --> 20:49.269
the know lottery numbers,
you know,

20:49.269 --> 20:50.869
they know
social insurance numbers.

20:50.869 --> 20:53.569
I've actually chosen to direct
my fake psychic powers

20:53.569 --> 20:56.269
to knowing one thing
and one thing only.

20:56.269 --> 20:59.400
I know the color of these
people's underwear.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.900
[laughter]

21:00.900 --> 21:02.529
It's okay if you're not
wearing any, ma'am.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.900
We'll sort that out,
don't worry about it.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.430
So, look, I'm gonna
give you each a card.

21:06.430 --> 21:08.230
And on this card,
I would like you to write down

21:08.230 --> 21:10.329
the color of your underwear,
but you got to have

21:10.329 --> 21:11.329
some fun with it, okay?

21:11.329 --> 21:12.829
So take the card.

21:12.829 --> 21:14.730
You can write down anything you
like, but have some fun with it.

21:14.730 --> 21:16.269
So if you're wearing white,
don't write just white.

21:16.269 --> 21:18.200
White would be
kind of boring, you know?

21:18.200 --> 21:19.430
So instead, be creative,
you know?

21:19.430 --> 21:22.029
You could write, uh--
you could write "marshmallow."

21:22.029 --> 21:23.430
You know?

21:23.430 --> 21:25.430
Or maybe instead of white, you
might write "cloud," you know?

21:25.430 --> 21:27.200
If you're wearing black,
don't write just black,

21:27.200 --> 21:28.230
black would be boring.

21:28.230 --> 21:30.500
Instead, maybe you would
write, like, "coal," you know?

21:30.500 --> 21:32.400
Or maybe you'd write
"midnight"--something hot,

21:32.400 --> 21:33.599
something sexy,
you know?

21:33.599 --> 21:35.000
Lace, something like that.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.170
Brown is not a color,
sir, just so you know, okay?

21:37.170 --> 21:38.170
Can't have that.

21:38.170 --> 21:39.099
[laughter]

21:39.099 --> 21:41.069
So have as much fun as you like,
write it down.

21:41.069 --> 21:42.569
When you're finished, hold the
card up to your chest

21:42.569 --> 21:43.730
so I can't see what
you've written.

21:43.730 --> 21:44.730
That's very important.

21:44.730 --> 21:46.099
So write down whatever you like.

21:46.099 --> 21:47.869
Have as much fun as you want,
but never let me see

21:47.869 --> 21:49.170
what you've written.

21:49.170 --> 21:51.170
In a minute, I'm gonna try
and be less like a psychic

21:51.170 --> 21:53.769
and more like a poker player who
knows a little bit of magic.

21:53.769 --> 21:56.069
I'm gonna try and figure out
whose underwear belongs to who,

21:56.069 --> 21:58.029
and who's lying,
who's telling the truth,

21:58.029 --> 22:00.299
combining a little bit of
the science of body language

22:00.299 --> 22:01.900
and a little bit of magic.

22:01.900 --> 22:03.670
So when you're finished,
I'll take your pens.

22:03.670 --> 22:04.829
Thank you.

22:04.829 --> 22:06.200
How're you doing there, sir?
Writing a book?

22:06.200 --> 22:07.230
Nope, you got it.
Good.

22:07.230 --> 22:08.670
Now if you would,
take all of your cards,

22:08.670 --> 22:10.930
pass them down to the
gentleman on the end.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.000
Okay, sir?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.230
So you get 'em--
take all the cards,

22:13.230 --> 22:15.069
pass them down to
the gentleman on the end.

22:15.069 --> 22:16.269
All right, and just pass them
down--look at you,

22:16.269 --> 22:17.900
having a little peek at the
cards there, sir, hey.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.069
Give them a shuffle
so I don't know the order.

22:19.069 --> 22:20.529
I'll turn my back--
give them a shuffle.

22:20.529 --> 22:22.069
I don't want to know who's
underwear belongs to who,

22:22.069 --> 22:23.529
so shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.

22:23.529 --> 22:25.900
And let me know when you've
done that--have you done that?

22:25.900 --> 22:26.900
- Yup.
- Excellent.

22:26.900 --> 22:28.200
And I'll take the cards.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.430
And we'll see what we got.

22:29.430 --> 22:32.930
Somebody here
wrote down "eggshell."

22:32.930 --> 22:35.170
Sexy, sexy.

22:35.170 --> 22:38.599
Somebody wrote down
"tangerine."

22:38.599 --> 22:41.069
Meow.
I like it.

22:41.069 --> 22:43.099
Somebody here
wrote down "midnight."

22:43.099 --> 22:44.500
Kind of middle of the road.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.069
Somebody wrote down "snow."

22:47.069 --> 22:48.430
Cha-cha-cha.

22:48.430 --> 22:52.069
Somebody wrote down
"ocean blue."

22:52.069 --> 22:54.099
If that's yours,
I'll [...] myself, sir.

22:54.099 --> 22:55.099
That's hilarious.

22:55.099 --> 22:56.200
[laughter]

22:56.200 --> 22:58.200
So like a poker player,
I'm gonna try and figure out

22:58.200 --> 23:00.170
who is lying,
who is telling the truth,

23:00.170 --> 23:01.369
whose underwear
belongs to who.

23:01.369 --> 23:03.400
and I'll do that just by
saying the word on the card.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.900
Uh, so when I say the word,
what I want you to do,

23:05.900 --> 23:07.599
is always answer in
the affirmative--

23:07.599 --> 23:09.700
always say,
"that's my underwear."

23:09.700 --> 23:11.700
Never tell me it's not your
underwear, always say,

23:11.700 --> 23:12.769
"that's my underwear."

23:12.769 --> 23:14.069
I'll try and figure out
who's lying,

23:14.069 --> 23:15.369
who's telling
the truth, okay?

23:15.369 --> 23:16.900
So we'll try it here.
Eggshell.

23:16.900 --> 23:17.900
- That's my underwear.

23:17.900 --> 23:19.569
I want it to be,
no question.

23:19.569 --> 23:21.329
- Eggshell.
- That's my underwear.

23:21.329 --> 23:22.730
- Possibly,
she closed her eyes.

23:22.730 --> 23:24.069
Maybe a sign.
Eggshell.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.170
- That's my underwear.
- Oh, maybe.

23:26.170 --> 23:27.400
Eggshell.
- That's my underwear.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.400
- Nice.
Eggshell.

23:28.400 --> 23:29.400
- That's my underwear.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.930
- Look at the smile
on your face, sir.

23:30.930 --> 23:32.230
[laughter]

23:32.230 --> 23:34.000
I'm gonna give you the
eggshell--don't tell me if

23:34.000 --> 23:35.170
I'm right or wrong,
just hang on to it.

23:35.170 --> 23:36.930
I do like this one--tangerine.

23:36.930 --> 23:38.099
Let's try here.
Tangerine.

23:38.099 --> 23:39.069
- That's my underwear.

23:39.069 --> 23:40.369
- Nice.
Tangerine.

23:40.369 --> 23:43.099
- That's my underwear.
- Oh.

23:43.099 --> 23:44.599
Think we might have a winner.
Tangerine.

23:44.599 --> 23:46.369
- That's my underwear.
- Hmm, possibly.

23:46.369 --> 23:48.329
Tangerine, sir?
- That's my underwear.

23:48.329 --> 23:50.200
- You could be
wearing two pair.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.369
Tough to say.

23:51.369 --> 23:53.369
I'm not sure, but I'm gonna give
you the tangerine.

23:53.369 --> 23:55.029
Don't tell me if I'm right
or wrong, just hang on to it.

23:55.029 --> 23:56.170
Uh, we'll try it here--
midnight.

23:56.170 --> 23:57.569
We'll start right back
over here.

23:57.569 --> 23:59.099
Looking at you.
Midnight.

23:59.099 --> 24:01.529
- That's my underwear.
- Hmm, possibly.

24:01.529 --> 24:03.200
Let's check with you again.
Midnight?

24:03.200 --> 24:05.000
- That's my underwear.
- Hmm, now, you blinked.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.029
That's tough to say.
Midnight?

24:06.029 --> 24:07.069
- That's my underwear.

24:07.069 --> 24:08.670
- Mm, I'm gonna
give you the midnight.

24:08.670 --> 24:13.170
Now, look, finally I have snow
and I have ocean blue.

24:13.170 --> 24:15.069
Either way, it's not working out
well for you, big guy.

24:15.069 --> 24:16.069
People are gonna talk.

24:16.069 --> 24:17.230
[laughter]

24:17.230 --> 24:19.069
Well, I'm gonna go with
my gut on this one.

24:19.069 --> 24:21.069
I'm gonna give you the snow
and I'm gonna give you

24:21.069 --> 24:22.230
the ocean blue.

24:22.230 --> 24:23.599
Now, look,
I gave you each a card.

24:23.599 --> 24:25.069
If I gave you the card
that you wrote on,

24:25.069 --> 24:27.099
if I gave you the card
that corresponds

24:27.099 --> 24:28.700
to the underwear
you're wearing,

24:28.700 --> 24:31.700
please return
to your seats now.

24:33.200 --> 24:36.200
[cheers and applause]

24:39.029 --> 24:42.029
Huzzah!
- Matt Disero.

24:42.029 --> 24:43.269
- Thank you.
That was fun.

24:43.269 --> 24:45.670
- Wow!

24:45.670 --> 24:49.569
Do you know how everybody
picks their underwear?

24:49.569 --> 24:51.099
- I know a little bit
about everyone.

24:51.099 --> 24:53.730
I know the intimate secrets of
everyone in the audience, yes.

24:53.730 --> 24:55.869
- Did that ever
go horribly wrong?

24:55.869 --> 24:57.569
- I once had
an audience member say,

24:57.569 --> 24:59.170
"You know,
I'm just not wearing any."

24:59.170 --> 25:00.400
- Oh.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.829
- And they've, uh, turned with
their back to the crowd,

25:02.829 --> 25:05.430
and opened up their fly in their
pants to actually show me

25:05.430 --> 25:08.170
their underwear, which,
you know, for the effect,

25:08.170 --> 25:10.000
goes wrong, but for me
personally, it was fantastic.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.369
- Well, that's probably why
you still do the trick.

25:12.369 --> 25:14.700
- Yeah, yeah, it's actually what
hope for all the time now.

25:14.700 --> 25:16.000
It's my dream job.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.930
- All right, let's see how
Penn and Teller are doing.

25:18.930 --> 25:20.000
- Yes.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.670
I wonder how they'll
manage with this.

25:21.670 --> 25:23.869
- I know.
Can you guess their underwear?

25:23.869 --> 25:26.170
- Well, if I let that secret--

25:26.170 --> 25:28.230
there are secrets,
and then there are secrets.

25:28.230 --> 25:29.569
- All right.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.170
All right.

25:31.170 --> 25:35.329
- Oh, uh, you know,
this is a...

25:35.329 --> 25:38.200
an effect that goes back,
I think,

25:38.200 --> 25:40.029
starts out mostly
as part of

25:40.029 --> 25:43.269
the religious act
of spiritualism.

25:43.269 --> 25:45.329
You would be given an object.

25:45.329 --> 25:47.269
And you'd be able to tell
who it belonged to,

25:47.269 --> 25:49.200
'cause the spirits
of the dead would tell you.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.769
Well, it's not that.

25:50.769 --> 25:53.069
Spirits of the dead
did not tell you.

25:53.069 --> 25:55.700
Um, also, you don't have
someone in the audience

25:55.700 --> 25:57.170
flirting with the people,
asking them,

25:57.170 --> 25:59.200
"Oh, by the way,
what color is your underwear?"

25:59.200 --> 26:00.829
Which is a great pickup line,
by the way.

26:00.829 --> 26:02.099
Try using it.

26:02.099 --> 26:04.500
Um, and, uh,
those also are real people

26:04.500 --> 26:05.930
from the audience.

26:05.930 --> 26:08.000
But one of the things
we ask ourselves,

26:08.000 --> 26:10.700
as magicians,
we ask ourselves,

26:10.700 --> 26:14.099
"if we had real
magical powers,

26:14.099 --> 26:17.369
what would we want to do?"

26:17.369 --> 26:19.930
You are the only one who's
answered that question

26:19.930 --> 26:21.170
from my heart.

26:21.170 --> 26:22.170
[laughter]

26:22.170 --> 26:24.500
If I had real
magical powers,

26:24.500 --> 26:27.230
I would want to do your
psychometry.

26:27.230 --> 26:29.730
Whether it's pseudo
or whether it's real,

26:29.730 --> 26:32.500
if I had magic powers,
they would be yours, Matt.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.200
They would be yours.
- Thank you.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.430
And that is why
you guys are the best.

26:36.430 --> 26:38.670
- [laughs]
- Totally busted me out on that.

26:38.670 --> 26:40.869
- So you're satisfied?
- Oh, of course.

26:40.869 --> 26:42.099
- Okay.
- Thank you very much, guys.

26:42.099 --> 26:43.430
- You did not fool them.

26:43.430 --> 26:45.230
But you entertained us all.

26:45.230 --> 26:46.529
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

26:46.529 --> 26:48.200
- It was so nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.430
- Ladies, Matt Disero!

26:50.430 --> 26:53.200
[cheers and applause]

26:53.200 --> 26:56.230
More amazing magic
when we return.

26:56.230 --> 26:59.930
[jazz music]

27:04.670 --> 27:07.670
[jazz music]

27:07.670 --> 27:11.099
[cheers and applause]

27:11.099 --> 27:13.769
- Welcome back to
"Penn & Teller: Fool Us."

27:13.769 --> 27:16.099
Let's meet
our next illusionist.

27:16.099 --> 27:18.500
[explosion booms]

27:18.500 --> 27:21.170
- My name is Rokas,
I'm from Lithuania,

27:21.170 --> 27:23.329
and I'm a holder of
the World Guinness Record

27:23.329 --> 27:27.230
for the highest throw of
a single playing card.

27:27.230 --> 27:29.000
Lithuania is a small country.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.269
The population is only
3 million people.

27:31.269 --> 27:33.029
There are not a lot
of magicians.

27:33.029 --> 27:35.269
I would say from five to seven.

27:35.269 --> 27:37.700
Maybe when I come back,
it will be eight.

27:37.700 --> 27:40.930
When I was 14,
I didn't really have friends.

27:40.930 --> 27:43.099
So I learned magic as,
like, a hobby.

27:43.099 --> 27:45.829
It was very hard to
learn magic in Lithuania

27:45.829 --> 27:47.869
because we didn't have
magic shops.

27:47.869 --> 27:51.529
But when I was 16, I knew that
magic is going to be my career.

27:51.529 --> 27:53.099
And now, I'm here.

27:53.099 --> 27:54.329
Yeah!

27:54.329 --> 27:56.269
I hope I will
inspire Lithuania kids

27:56.269 --> 27:57.700
to pursue their dreams.

27:57.700 --> 28:01.900
[cheers and applause]

28:01.900 --> 28:04.369
- Our next performer
comes from a country

28:04.369 --> 28:06.730
with only five
working magicians.

28:06.730 --> 28:09.200
Well, four,
since he's here now.

28:09.200 --> 28:12.900
Please welcome
Lithuania magician, Rokas.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.900
[cheers and applause]

28:17.569 --> 28:20.230
- Hello, Mr. Penn.
Hello, Mr. Teller.

28:20.230 --> 28:21.700
Hello Las Vegas.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.529
[applause]

28:23.529 --> 28:25.369
My name is Rokas,
and I have always wanted

28:25.369 --> 28:27.069
to make people feel better.

28:27.069 --> 28:29.230
I told this to my teacher,
and she said,

28:29.230 --> 28:32.400
"Rokas,
you should be a doctor."

28:32.400 --> 28:35.269
As you can see,
I failed.

28:35.269 --> 28:38.099
But wherever I go,
I bring an x-ray machine

28:38.099 --> 28:41.269
to remind me not to give up
on my teacher's dreams for me.

28:41.269 --> 28:43.170
Actually, it is
an amazing machine.

28:43.170 --> 28:44.430
It has many features.

28:44.430 --> 28:49.099
And one if them is,
I can see through my body.

28:49.099 --> 28:52.599
And if I snap my fingers,
watch what happens.

28:52.599 --> 28:54.269
I will need this
if I fool those guys,

28:54.269 --> 28:56.099
and this if I don't.

28:56.099 --> 28:59.099
But for now,
I need a deck of cards.

29:00.970 --> 29:02.000
Thank you.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.069
[applause]

29:03.069 --> 29:06.269
I need an amazing volunteer,
so please give a big

29:06.269 --> 29:08.900
round of applause to
Alyson Hannigan.

29:08.900 --> 29:11.069
[cheers and applause]

29:11.069 --> 29:14.000
Hello, Alyson.
- Hi.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.329
- Alyson, please confirm
that all the cards,

29:16.329 --> 29:17.930
they're not the same.

29:17.930 --> 29:19.029
Are they different?
Yes?

29:19.029 --> 29:20.500
- Yes.
- Good.

29:20.500 --> 29:23.000
Now Alyson, when I riffle
through the cards,

29:23.000 --> 29:26.069
all you have to do is just say
"stop" any time, okay

29:26.069 --> 29:27.069
- Stop!
- Here?

29:27.069 --> 29:28.000
- Yes.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
- Okay, this is that card
you stopped at, okay?

29:30.000 --> 29:31.069
- Okay.

29:31.069 --> 29:34.730
- Everybody please remember it,
and Alyson,

29:34.730 --> 29:38.700
draw something very unique
in the center of the card.

29:38.700 --> 29:39.700
- Okay.

29:39.700 --> 29:42.670
- The reason why
Alyson is doing this

29:42.670 --> 29:44.500
is because I told her to.

29:44.500 --> 29:47.599
[laughter]

29:47.599 --> 29:49.400
Now, this is your signature,
okay?

29:49.400 --> 29:54.269
And in magic, every move creates
a different kind of an effect.

29:54.269 --> 29:57.269
For example,
this magical move...

29:59.500 --> 30:03.569
makes all the cards
appear on the floor.

30:03.569 --> 30:04.829
[laughter]

30:04.829 --> 30:08.230
This effect was discovered
by Isaac Newton in 1687.

30:08.230 --> 30:09.430
[laughter]

30:09.430 --> 30:11.930
Thank you for getting the joke,
I appreciate that.

30:11.930 --> 30:14.569
Uh, Alyson, don't worry about
the cards, okay?

30:14.569 --> 30:15.569
- Okay.

30:15.569 --> 30:17.529
- Because we have
an x-ray machine.

30:17.529 --> 30:21.200
So let's take another
deck of cards.

30:21.200 --> 30:24.200
[snaps fingers]

30:26.529 --> 30:28.599
Alyson, take your cards.

30:28.599 --> 30:30.769
Take it out from the box.

30:30.769 --> 30:33.430
Okay?
Please shuffle the cards.

30:33.430 --> 30:35.069
Make sure they're
all different.

30:35.069 --> 30:36.200
Throw it away, no problem.

30:36.200 --> 30:38.029
Yeah.

30:38.029 --> 30:39.700
Shuffle the cards.
That's perfect.

30:39.700 --> 30:41.069
- Guys, stop looking at me.

30:41.069 --> 30:42.369
Oh!
- Oh, no.

30:42.369 --> 30:44.369
Can I have the cards?
- Sorry, I'm terrible at that.

30:44.369 --> 30:47.329
- So, Alyson, your card,
your signed card seems like

30:47.329 --> 30:50.400
it would be very easy
for me to find your card.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.829
But it's fool us.

30:52.829 --> 30:55.869
So let's make your card...

30:58.099 --> 31:00.500
look like every other
card in this deck.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.599
- Wow.

31:01.599 --> 31:04.200
[applause]

31:04.200 --> 31:05.670
- Thank you.

31:05.670 --> 31:08.000
Now, Alyson,
in a minute--

31:08.000 --> 31:11.500
again, your card goes somewhere
in the middle, okay?

31:11.500 --> 31:15.369
And in a minute, I will have you
to hold the cards like this.

31:15.369 --> 31:18.900
Okay, so please hold
your left hand like that.

31:18.900 --> 31:21.170
And cover it with
your right hand, please.

31:21.170 --> 31:24.529
In a minute,
I'm going to do a magical move.

31:24.529 --> 31:26.029
Watch.

31:26.029 --> 31:28.170
[snaps fingers]

31:29.200 --> 31:32.200
Your card jumped
under your elbow.

31:34.599 --> 31:36.200
But it didn't stop there.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.029
[laughter]

31:37.029 --> 31:40.069
Because it jumped
into my pocket.

31:40.069 --> 31:43.329
And inside my pocket,
I have nothing

31:43.329 --> 31:44.599
but my wallet.

31:44.599 --> 31:47.769
And inside it's empty,
with an exception.

31:47.769 --> 31:50.069
I have an envelope here.

31:50.069 --> 31:53.700
And Alyson,
could you please

31:53.700 --> 31:56.930
open it, because there's
something inside

31:56.930 --> 31:59.700
that might put a smile
on your face.

31:59.700 --> 32:02.000
Just--hand me the cards, yes.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.599
Thank you.
- Whew!

32:03.599 --> 32:07.329
Okay.

32:07.329 --> 32:08.829
Ah!

32:08.829 --> 32:09.829
[audience gasps]

32:09.829 --> 32:12.230
[cheers and applause]

32:12.230 --> 32:14.029
- I know what
you're thinking.

32:14.029 --> 32:15.500
Because we are only warmed up,

32:15.500 --> 32:18.500
let's put the card
into the most impossible place

32:18.500 --> 32:20.069
in this entire room, okay?

32:20.069 --> 32:24.670
Again, your card goes
somewhere in the middle.

32:24.670 --> 32:26.200
And now watch.

32:26.200 --> 32:29.099
[snaps fingers]

32:30.170 --> 32:33.829
Did you feel anything?
- No.

32:33.829 --> 32:35.529
- Say yes.
- Yes.

32:35.529 --> 32:38.529
[laughter]

32:39.869 --> 32:43.500
- There's something
in Alyson's stomach.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.730
Alyson, could you please
stand on the sign

32:45.730 --> 32:47.170
that says, "stand here"?

32:47.170 --> 32:48.430
Just on the sign.
- Sure.

32:48.430 --> 32:50.930
- Okay, please hold your
hands just like this.

32:50.930 --> 32:52.029
Perfect.

32:52.029 --> 32:55.599
And when I tell you to,
make two steps to your left.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.529
Say, "yes, Rokas."
- Yes, Rokas.

32:57.529 --> 32:59.400
- Okay, perfect.
Are you ready?

32:59.400 --> 33:01.130
- It's a good thing
you're attractive.

33:01.130 --> 33:02.569
- Okay--
thank you.

33:02.569 --> 33:05.430
Do it!

33:05.430 --> 33:09.069
[audience gasps]

33:09.069 --> 33:10.599
I like making people
feel better

33:10.599 --> 33:13.069
and I like making people
feel happy.

33:13.069 --> 33:17.000
And sometimes,
things that makes us happy,

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
surprise us from inside.

33:23.529 --> 33:26.529
[cheers and applause]

33:31.769 --> 33:34.400
Thank you.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.529
Wait.

33:35.529 --> 33:39.900
[cheers and applause]

33:39.900 --> 33:43.029
Watch.

33:43.029 --> 33:46.029
- Oh.
Argh.

33:46.029 --> 33:47.200
[giggles]

33:47.200 --> 33:48.200
Hmm...

33:48.200 --> 33:49.400
[audience gasps]

33:49.400 --> 33:50.869
[cheers and applause]

33:50.869 --> 33:52.569
- Is this your card?

33:52.569 --> 33:54.500
- That is my card!

33:54.500 --> 33:57.329
Rokas, everybody.

33:57.329 --> 34:00.400
[cheers and applause]

34:00.400 --> 34:02.400
Wow.

34:02.400 --> 34:03.769
Oh, my goodness.

34:03.769 --> 34:04.769
And that is my card.

34:04.769 --> 34:06.200
- No, no, that's for
EBay, sorry.

34:06.200 --> 34:07.329
- [laughs]

34:07.329 --> 34:09.699
So you actually
told me earlier that

34:09.699 --> 34:14.199
part of the reason that you're--
you learned English so well

34:14.199 --> 34:15.268
is because of magic.

34:15.268 --> 34:16.699
Is that true?

34:16.699 --> 34:20.570
- We had English lessons at
school, but I was just too lazy.

34:20.570 --> 34:21.869
- [laughs]

34:21.869 --> 34:24.000
- And I had no
motivation for that.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.900
And...

34:25.900 --> 34:28.070
I got this magic magazine.

34:28.070 --> 34:29.369
And I was like,
"I want to read this."

34:29.369 --> 34:31.900
So I had my dictionary
and a magic magazine,

34:31.900 --> 34:36.099
and I was just translating
every word of an article,

34:36.099 --> 34:37.429
and this is how
I learned English.

34:37.429 --> 34:38.429
- That's great, did--

34:38.429 --> 34:40.099
- It was two days ago,
by the way.

34:40.099 --> 34:41.570
- [laughs]

34:41.570 --> 34:43.699
All right, well it's time
to go to the boys.

34:43.699 --> 34:45.829
Let's see what they think.

34:45.829 --> 34:46.869
Gentlemen.

34:46.869 --> 34:48.900
- Uh, when you do this act,

34:48.900 --> 34:50.670
do you do it also
in Lithuanian?

34:50.670 --> 34:51.829
- In Lithuanian?
Yes.

34:51.829 --> 34:52.829
- The language?
- Yes.

34:52.829 --> 34:54.000
- Ah, I'd love to hear that.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.900
Do a little bit of it
in Lithuanian.

34:55.900 --> 34:56.900
- Okay.

34:56.900 --> 34:57.900
Um...

34:57.900 --> 35:00.969
[speaking Lithuanian]

35:03.829 --> 35:06.869
[cheers and applause]

35:06.869 --> 35:08.530
- Very nice.

35:08.530 --> 35:09.730
Very nice.
- Thank you.

35:09.730 --> 35:11.070
So--
[laughs]

35:11.070 --> 35:13.070
Um, boy, it's a great act.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.599
It's great to see
card to wallet

35:14.599 --> 35:17.869
where it comes,
not out of the inner pocket,

35:17.869 --> 35:19.000
but out of the outer pocket.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.570
That's a great twist on that.

35:20.570 --> 35:23.170
Makes it much more
deceptive to others.

35:23.170 --> 35:25.570
We also love seeing you
do film to life.

35:25.570 --> 35:28.400
Nice to see it done with a big--
in a big way like that.

35:28.400 --> 35:33.170
The thing that we might
have--uh, we might be right on

35:33.170 --> 35:35.070
and we might not is--

35:35.070 --> 35:37.329
- Why don't you just "not"
and just give him the trophy?

35:37.329 --> 35:38.570
- I know, you--
- He's so sweet.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.400
- He is so sweet.
- He's really cute.

35:40.400 --> 35:43.030
I bet people would love
to come see him.

35:43.030 --> 35:44.199
- All of that is true.

35:44.199 --> 35:45.329
[cheers and applause]

35:45.329 --> 35:48.099
- Just give it to him.
Come on.

35:48.099 --> 35:50.070
- Okay, well maybe
we're wrong on this.

35:50.070 --> 35:54.099
But, you know, a lot of times,
the most innocuous things

35:54.099 --> 35:57.699
a magician does, the things that
absolutely don't matter,

35:57.699 --> 35:59.530
have nothing to do
with the trick,

35:59.530 --> 36:01.099
may be the whole crux.

36:01.099 --> 36:04.070
Like, just when you take a--
you know, I take that pencil

36:04.070 --> 36:06.429
and put it down on top
of that screen.

36:06.429 --> 36:11.070
Or you take a notebook
and put it over here like this.

36:11.070 --> 36:13.699
You take a card and you place it
on top of an x-ray machine,

36:13.699 --> 36:16.369
and you put one thing over here,
one thing over there.

36:16.369 --> 36:18.829
Doesn't mean anything
unless you know,

36:18.829 --> 36:20.000
and then it means
everything.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.869
And I hope we're wrong.

36:21.869 --> 36:23.230
- I hope you're wrong too.

36:23.230 --> 36:25.099
- I hope you are,
but they're not.

36:25.099 --> 36:26.829
- Oh!

36:26.829 --> 36:28.500
All right.
- You're right.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.369
- So you didn't fool them,
but you certainly

36:31.369 --> 36:33.199
are so charming
and wonderful.

36:33.199 --> 36:35.030
And, oh, I love you.

36:35.030 --> 36:36.500
- [laughs]

36:36.500 --> 36:37.900
- All right.
- Thank you.

36:37.900 --> 36:39.230
- Thank you, Rokas.

36:39.230 --> 36:40.429
[applause]

36:40.429 --> 36:41.599
- Wonderful.

36:41.599 --> 36:42.699
[cheers and applause]

36:42.699 --> 36:44.170
- Not enough for you?

36:44.170 --> 36:47.570
How 'bout a trick by our
very own Penn and Teller.

36:47.570 --> 36:49.369
Believe me, you don't
want to miss it,

36:49.369 --> 36:50.929
so stick around.

36:50.929 --> 36:53.929
[jazz music]

37:00.469 --> 37:03.500
[jazz music]

37:03.500 --> 37:07.070
[cheers and applause]

37:07.070 --> 37:09.099
- Here's a trick
we've played on you.

37:09.099 --> 37:12.199
We've secretly saved
the best for last.

37:12.199 --> 37:14.500
Please welcome
Penn and Teller.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.500
[cheers and applause]

37:21.269 --> 37:24.730
- 30 years ago,
we were on a whole season

37:24.730 --> 37:26.170
of "Saturday Night Live."

37:26.170 --> 37:30.269
And it was that season--
uh, 1986--not very memorable,

37:30.269 --> 37:33.570
but that is the season that got
the most complaint letters

37:33.570 --> 37:37.030
they had ever gotten in
the history of the network.

37:37.030 --> 37:38.230
And it wasn't
the whole season,

37:38.230 --> 37:40.869
it just happened to be
one particular show.

37:40.869 --> 37:43.170
And it wasn't just
one particular show;

37:43.170 --> 37:44.699
it was one particular bit.

37:44.699 --> 37:47.199
And we happened
to be there for that.

37:47.199 --> 37:49.369
As a matter of fact,
it was our bit.

37:49.369 --> 37:50.769
[laughter]

37:50.769 --> 37:54.170
We got the most complaints that
the network had ever gotten

37:54.170 --> 37:56.329
in the history of the network
with a trick.

37:56.329 --> 37:57.369
[cheers]
Thank you.

37:57.369 --> 37:58.429
[cheers and applause]

37:58.429 --> 38:01.599
And, uh...

38:01.599 --> 38:03.570
it's a little perplexing
why we got

38:03.570 --> 38:06.269
that many complaints on this,
because it's a simple

38:06.269 --> 38:09.329
sleight of hand trick you may
have seen a zillion times.

38:09.329 --> 38:11.230
We took a--you know,
it's a rope trick.

38:11.230 --> 38:12.699
And a simple sleight of hand.

38:12.699 --> 38:15.829
It's just a, uh--well,
it's a cut and restored rope.

38:15.829 --> 38:18.599
We just cut it in half
like this.

38:18.599 --> 38:20.369
And then we cut it again.

38:20.369 --> 38:23.030
Each of the pieces
off like that

38:23.030 --> 38:25.000
and each of the pieces
off like that,

38:25.000 --> 38:26.269
and we threw it
into the audience.

38:26.269 --> 38:29.030
And then, with a little bit
of mumbo jumbo,

38:29.030 --> 38:31.570
we restored that rope
completely.

38:31.570 --> 38:32.599
[applause]

38:32.599 --> 38:34.500
And then threw the rope
into the audience.

38:34.500 --> 38:38.429
Now, that was the most
complaints they've ever gotten

38:38.429 --> 38:41.170
on that net--of course, we
didn't do it exactly like that.

38:41.170 --> 38:43.230
We used a slightly different
thing besides the rope.

38:43.230 --> 38:44.900
But it was the exact
same trick.

38:44.900 --> 38:46.199
[audience gasps]

38:46.199 --> 38:49.000
We did a, uh--this is our
California kingsnake.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.530
This is Elsie,
our California kingsnake.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.030
I don't want to
frighten anybody there,

38:54.030 --> 38:56.429
but if you're okay with snakes,
you can see that

38:56.429 --> 38:57.429
it is indeed
a real snake.

38:57.429 --> 38:58.929
Now, what's funny
about this is,

38:58.929 --> 39:01.400
the network--there's a lot of
stuff that's political

39:01.400 --> 39:05.400
and sexual, they do drug stuff,
they do racial stuff.

39:05.400 --> 39:08.070
But this got the most
complaints they ever got.

39:08.070 --> 39:12.030
We just took our
California kingsnake,

39:12.030 --> 39:13.769
uh, just like
we took the rope.

39:13.769 --> 39:16.170
And as you can see,
Elsie's very, very active.

39:16.170 --> 39:18.429
And we just took our same
switchblade,

39:18.429 --> 39:19.829
and then we just cut her--

39:19.829 --> 39:21.670
[audience screams]

39:21.670 --> 39:24.030
in half, just like that.

39:24.030 --> 39:27.099
And then we cut off
each of the pieces

39:27.099 --> 39:29.030
just like that.

39:29.030 --> 39:32.000
And we cut off the other piece
just like that

39:32.000 --> 39:34.170
and threw that
into the audience.

39:34.170 --> 39:36.030
And then, after a little
mumbo jumbo,

39:36.030 --> 39:38.829
we just totally
restored her

39:38.829 --> 39:40.869
until she was
completely okay.

39:40.869 --> 39:43.000
And then we threw
that into the--

39:43.000 --> 39:44.329
no, just kidding about that.

39:44.329 --> 39:48.269
You know--and people
complained about this

39:48.269 --> 39:50.269
and said, even if
they knew it was a trick,

39:50.269 --> 39:52.030
it could still
give people ideas.

39:52.030 --> 39:56.070
Now, what I find so interesting
is, two months later,

39:56.070 --> 39:58.730
we were on and we did a trick
where we put Teller

39:58.730 --> 40:01.570
in a water tank,
completely submerged him,

40:01.570 --> 40:04.170
and within the plot of
the trick, he drowned.

40:04.170 --> 40:06.869
I was doing card trick,
I screwed it up, he drowned.

40:06.869 --> 40:09.670
And the producer asked us to
have Teller come out at the end

40:09.670 --> 40:12.230
and wave and show
that he really was okay.

40:12.230 --> 40:14.099
We didn't do that.

40:14.099 --> 40:15.170
And then,
at the end of the show,

40:15.170 --> 40:17.329
where the whole cast
comes out and waves,

40:17.329 --> 40:19.599
Teller wasn't there,
we just left him dead.

40:19.599 --> 40:20.730
[laughter]

40:20.730 --> 40:23.230
And when we killed Teller
on the show,

40:23.230 --> 40:26.869
we got no complaints at all.

40:26.869 --> 40:29.070
So please don't
write in about this.

40:29.070 --> 40:31.900
The snake is fine
and so is Teller,

40:31.900 --> 40:33.230
as though you care.

40:33.230 --> 40:34.769
There she is right there, see?

40:34.769 --> 40:35.869
[cheers and applause]

40:35.869 --> 40:36.929
You like animals?

40:36.929 --> 40:38.269
You like animals, don't you?
- Yeah.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.329
[applause]

40:39.329 --> 40:41.429
- Come say hi to Elsie.
- Hi, Elsie.

40:41.429 --> 40:43.329
- Yah.
- Oh.

40:43.329 --> 40:45.199
Hi.
- Oh, she--

40:45.199 --> 40:47.199
- All right,
well that's it for tonight.

40:47.199 --> 40:51.269
Set your alarms for next week or
just leave you TV on until then.

40:51.269 --> 40:53.170
Good night!
- Night night.

40:53.170 --> 40:56.170
[cheers and applause]

40:56.170 --> 40:59.170
[jazz music]

40:59.170 --> 41:07.000
