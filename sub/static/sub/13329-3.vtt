WEBVTT

00:06.740 --> 00:09.777
* EMINEM IS NOT VERY GOOD

00:09.877 --> 00:12.080
* 50 CENT IS
NOT VERY GOOD *

00:12.180 --> 00:14.415
* SNOOP DOGG IS
NOT VERY GOOD *

00:14.515 --> 00:17.218
* MOS DEF IS
NOT VERY GOOD *

00:17.318 --> 00:19.687
* BUT THE RHYMENOCEROS
IS VERY VERY GOOD... *

00:19.787 --> 00:22.090
BASS SOLO.
BASS SOLO OVER.

00:22.190 --> 00:25.326
* JAY-Z IS
NOT VERY GOOD *

00:25.426 --> 00:27.395
* LIL WAYNE IS
NOT VERY GOOD *

00:27.495 --> 00:30.631
* QUEEN LATIFAH IS
NOT VERY GOOD. *

00:31.932 --> 00:33.734
( three people clapping )

00:35.636 --> 00:38.306
- THANK YOU.
- THAT WAS BRAND NEW.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.278
( theme music playing )

01:10.138 --> 01:11.372
Murray:
OKAY, BAND MEETING.

01:11.472 --> 01:15.243
- UH, WELL, JEMAINE?
- PRESENT.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.877
WHO ELSE HAVE
WE GOT HERE? BRET?

01:16.977 --> 01:18.612
- YUP.
- AND WHO ELSE?

01:18.712 --> 01:22.483
MU-- MUR RAY. OH.

01:22.583 --> 01:26.854
GREG'S WRITTEN THIS.
HE'S PUT THE Rs
TOO FAR APART.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.956
IT'S "MURRAY."
MURRAY, PRESENT.

01:29.056 --> 01:32.693
OKAY, ITEM ONE:
TEXAS, LEXUS--

01:32.793 --> 01:35.696
TWO RHYMING WORDS.
DO YOU THINK YOU
COULD USE THOSE?

01:35.796 --> 01:37.665
- NO.
- MAYBE.

01:37.765 --> 01:38.999
"MAYBE" FROM BRET.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.570
ITEM TWO: MANAGER'S NOTES
FROM YESTERDAY'S GIG.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.238
RIGHT, HERE WE ARE.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.041
"A GOOD GIG.
VERY ENJOYABLE."

01:48.142 --> 01:50.244
OH, SEVERAL COMPLAINTS
ABOUT THE NOISE.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.912
YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER
THIS IS IN A LIBRARY, GUYS.

01:52.012 --> 01:54.382
- BEAR THAT IN MIND.
- BUT IT'S SO HARD
TO PLAY THERE,

01:54.482 --> 01:56.384
BECAUSE EVERYONE
WANTS US TO BE QUIET.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.452
- THEY'RE SHUSHING
US CONSTANTLY.
- THEY'RE TRYING TO READ.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.988
WE MIGHT AS WELL NOT
BE THERE IF WE'RE NOT
GONNA MAKE ANY SOUND.

02:01.088 --> 02:05.125
YOU CAN MAKE SOUND,
JUST MAKE IT SO THAT
PEOPLE CAN'T HEAR YOU.

02:05.226 --> 02:08.396
OKAY. OH, I'VE GOT
ANOTHER NOTE HERE--

02:08.496 --> 02:10.798
"DISSING."
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.000
DOES THAT MAKE
ANY SENSE TO YOU?

02:13.100 --> 02:17.104
- JEMAINE.
- BRET DISSED A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN THAT RAP THAT HE DID.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.072
RIGHT.
IN THE SONG, YEAH.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.975
DISSING, BAD-MOUTHING.
WHO ARE THOSE GUYS THAT
YOU WERE DISSING?

02:22.075 --> 02:24.778
THE ONLY ONE I COULD
MAKE OUT WAS SNOOPY.
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM WITH HIM?

02:24.878 --> 02:26.880
- NO, IT WAS SNOOP DOGG.
- I KNOW HE'S A DOG, BRET.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.750
I'M NOT TOTALLY
IN THE DARK AGES. I DO
GO OUT ONCE IN A WHILE.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.786
- HE'S LOVABLE.
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
- NO, HE'S A RAPPER.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.655
THEY'RE ALL RAPPERS.
I WAS JUST DISSING
OTHER RAPPERS.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.558
JUST KEEP YOUR DISSING
PRIVATE, ALL RIGHT?

02:37.658 --> 02:40.294
I KEEP MINE PRIVATE.
I MEAN, I DISS GREG SOMETIMES,

02:40.394 --> 02:42.730
BUT I KEEP IT PRIVATE.

02:43.964 --> 02:45.699
YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT,
DID YOU, GREG?

02:45.799 --> 02:47.768
Yes, Murray, I heard.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.138
YOU'RE ONLY SUPPOSED
TO HEAR WHEN I HAVE
THE BUTTON DOWN.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.274
- CAN YOU HEAR THAT?
- It is broken, Murray.

02:53.374 --> 02:57.678
BROKEN? HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN HEARING ME?

02:57.778 --> 02:59.980
All year.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.550
CAN WE GET THAT FIXED,
GREG, PLEASE?

03:02.650 --> 03:06.454
- Yes, I'll look
into it tomorrow.
- TOMORROW?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.591
( whispering )
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT GUY?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.460
USELESS. WHAT DOES
HE DO ALL DAY?

03:12.560 --> 03:14.194
( normal voice )
YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT,
DID YOU, GREG?

03:14.295 --> 03:17.831
GOOD, SO HE DIDN'T
HEAR THAT LAST BIT.
THAT'S HOW YOU DISS SOMEONE.

03:17.931 --> 03:21.469
DID YOU SEE WHAT
I DID THERE? I DIDN'T
START A FIGHT WITH GREG,

03:21.569 --> 03:24.838
I DIDN'T HURT HIS FEELINGS.
GREG'S GOT FEELINGS.

03:24.938 --> 03:26.707
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT THESE RAPPERS
THAT YOU'RE DISSING?

03:26.807 --> 03:28.776
- YOU MIGHT HURT
THEIR FEELINGS.
- JEMAINE'S RIGHT.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.545
YOU MIGHT HURT
THEIR FEELINGS,
ALL RIGHT?

03:31.645 --> 03:33.481
HAVE YOU GUYS
EVER HAD HURT FEELINGS?

03:33.581 --> 03:36.817
* SOME PEOPLE
SAY THAT RAPPERS
DON'T HAVE FEELINGS *

03:36.917 --> 03:38.919
- * WE HAVE FEELINGS
- * WE HAVE FEELINGS

03:39.019 --> 03:41.589
- * SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT
WE ARE NOT RAPPERS *
- * WE'RE RAPPERS

03:41.689 --> 03:44.525
- * THAT HURTS OUR FEELINGS
- * IT HURTS OUR FEELINGS WHEN
YOU SAY WE'RE NOT RAPPERS *

03:44.625 --> 03:46.627
* SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT
RAPPERS ARE INVINCIBLE *

03:46.727 --> 03:48.462
- * WE'RE VINCIBLE
- * WE'RE VINCIBLE

03:48.562 --> 03:50.364
* WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT
TO HEAR ARE TRUE STORIES *

03:50.464 --> 03:52.700
- * REAL EXPERIENCES
- * AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL RAPS

03:52.800 --> 03:55.135
- * THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO US
- * ALL TRUE, BRING THE RHYME!

03:55.235 --> 03:57.638
* I MAKE A MEAL FOR MY FRIENDS,
TRY TO MAKE IT DELICIOUS *

03:57.738 --> 03:59.807
* TRY TO KEEP IT NUTRITIOUS,
CREATE WONDERFUL DISHES *

03:59.907 --> 04:02.443
* NOT ONE OF THEM THINKS
ABOUT THE WAY I FEEL *

04:02.543 --> 04:04.678
* NOBODY COMPLIMENTS
THE MEAL *

04:04.778 --> 04:10.017
* I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS,
I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS *

04:10.117 --> 04:13.554
* I FEEL LIKE
A PRIZE ASSHOLE, NO ONE
EVEN MENTIONS MY CASSEROLE *

04:13.654 --> 04:18.726
* I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS,
I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS *

04:18.826 --> 04:22.330
* YOU COULD'VE SAID
SOMETHING NICE ABOUT
MY PROFITA ROLLS *

04:22.430 --> 04:24.832
* HERE'S A LITTLE STORY
TO BRING A TEAR TO YOUR EYE *

04:24.932 --> 04:27.401
* I WAS SHOPPING
FOR A WETSUIT TO SCUBA DIVE *

04:27.501 --> 04:29.503
* BUT EVERY SUIT I TRIED WAS
TOO BIG AROUND THE THIGHS *

04:29.603 --> 04:32.640
* AND THE ASSISTANT SUGGESTED
I TRY A LADIES' SIZE *

04:32.740 --> 04:36.977
* I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS,
I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS *

04:37.077 --> 04:41.281
* I'M NOT GONNA WEAR
A LADIES' WETSUIT,
I'M A MAN *

04:41.382 --> 04:45.786
* I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS,
I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS *

04:45.886 --> 04:49.222
* GET ME A SMALL
MAN'S WETSUIT, PLEASE *

04:49.323 --> 04:52.259
* IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, 2003

04:52.360 --> 04:54.728
* WAITING FOR A CALL
FROM MY FAMILY *

04:57.264 --> 04:58.766
* THEY FORGOT ABOUT ME

04:58.866 --> 05:04.372
* I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS,
I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS *

05:04.472 --> 05:07.608
* THE DAY AFTER MY BIRTHDAY
IS NOT MY BIRTHDAY, MOM *

05:07.708 --> 05:10.444
* I CALL MY FRIENDS,
SAY, "LET'S GO INTO TOWN" *

05:10.544 --> 05:12.580
* BUT THEY'RE ALL TOO BUSY
TO GO INTO TOWN *

05:12.680 --> 05:14.748
* SO I GO BY MYSELF,
I GO INTO TOWN *

05:14.848 --> 05:17.351
* THEN I SEE ALL MY FRIENDS,
THEY'RE ALL IN TOWN *

05:17.451 --> 05:22.990
* I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS,
I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS *

05:23.090 --> 05:25.593
* THEY'RE ALL LINED UP
TO WATCH THAT MOVIE
"MAID IN MANHATTAN" *

05:25.693 --> 05:28.462
* HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN TOLD THAT
YOUR ASS IS TOO BIG? *

05:28.562 --> 05:30.698
* HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ASKED
IF YOUR HAIR IS A WIG? *

05:30.798 --> 05:32.700
* HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TOLD
YOU'RE MEDIOCRE IN BED? *

05:32.800 --> 05:34.935
* HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN TOLD YOU'VE GOT
A WEIRD-SHAPED HEAD? *

05:35.035 --> 05:37.405
* HAS YOUR FAMILY
EVER FORGOTTEN YOU
AND DRIVEN AWAY? *

05:37.505 --> 05:39.740
* ONCE AGAIN,
THEY FORGOT ABOUT J *

05:39.840 --> 05:41.842
* WERE YOU EVER
CALLED "HOMO" BECAUSE
AT SCHOOL YOU TOOK DRAMA? *

05:41.942 --> 05:44.545
* HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN TOLD THAT
YOU LOOK LIKE A LLAMA? *

05:44.645 --> 05:48.115
- * TEARS OF A RAPPER
- * TEARS OF A RAPPER

05:48.215 --> 05:51.852
* I'M CRYING TEARS
OF A RAPPER *

05:51.952 --> 05:54.488
* TEARS OF A RAPPER.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.492
YES, WELL,
ALL GOOD EXAMPLES.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.894
- CAN WE GO NOW?
- BUT MY POINT IS:

06:00.994 --> 06:02.730
JUST BE CAREFUL
AROUND RAPPERS,
ALL RIGHT?

06:02.830 --> 06:04.532
YOU HURT THEIR FEELINGS
AND KABOOM--

06:04.632 --> 06:06.600
THEY'LL HURT YOU MORE
THAN YOUR FEELINGS--

06:06.700 --> 06:08.201
THEY'LL HURT YOUR PRETTY
LITTLE BRAIN, BRET.

06:08.301 --> 06:10.771
IT'LL BE GONE,
THEN YOU'LL HAVE
NO FEELINGS.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.473
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?
- WELL, I WOULDN'T LIKE THAT.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.542
NO, NONE OF US WOULD.
OKAY, POINT MADE.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.910
END OF MEETING. SCRAM.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.480
HERE IN THE UNITED STATES,
RIVALRIES BETWEEN RAPPERS

06:19.580 --> 06:22.349
USUALLY RESULT
IN DEATH OR WORSE.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.251
- DEATH?
- YEAH, OR WORSE.

06:24.351 --> 06:27.154
ISN'T IT THE SAME WAY
WITH RAPPERS BACK
IN NEWFOUNDLAND?

06:27.254 --> 06:28.756
- I'M NOT SURE.
- NEW ZEALAND.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.659
YEAH, JEMAINE AND I,
WE'RE THE ONLY RAPPERS
APART FROM STEVE,

06:31.759 --> 06:33.627
BUT HE'S--
HE'S A LOVELY GUY.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.029
- HE'S VERY FRIENDLY.
- WHICH RAPPERS DID
YOU DISS, BRET?

06:36.129 --> 06:39.399
I JUST DISSED
ALL THE RAPPERS
I COULD THINK OF.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.436
OH SHIT. YOU WANT
TO BE CAREFUL, BRET.

06:42.536 --> 06:45.939
I HEARD OF ONE RAPPER--
HE CHOPPED THIS GUY'S
WHOLE BODY OFF,

06:46.039 --> 06:47.575
JUST LEFT
THE DICK BEHIND.

06:47.675 --> 06:50.277
DON'T YOU MEAN THEY--
THEY CHOPPED OFF HIS DICK?

06:50.377 --> 06:53.447
NO, I MEAN THEY HELD
HIS DICK AND CHOPPED
HIS WHOLE BODY OFF.

06:53.547 --> 06:56.817
THAT'S ALL HE WAS
IN THE END-- A DICK.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.161
UM, JOHNNYBOY,

07:08.261 --> 07:10.397
THANKS FOR APPLYING
TO BE IN MY GANG.

07:10.498 --> 07:13.033
DO YOU HAVE
ANY GANG EXPERIENCE?

07:13.133 --> 07:16.169
DO I HAVE GANG EXPERIENCE?
I WAS IN THE SNAKE EYES,

07:16.269 --> 07:18.071
THE DUCKIES,
THE CUCKOOS,

07:18.171 --> 07:20.774
THE VAMPIRES,
THE PHARAOHS,
THE BALLROOM DANCERS,

07:20.874 --> 07:24.377
THE HOBO LORDS,
THE LITTLE ENCHANTERS, THE--

07:24.478 --> 07:26.514
I WAS A NAVY SEAL
FOR 15 YEARS.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.916
- OKAY.
- I'M OFFICIALLY AWOL,

07:29.016 --> 07:31.985
SO DON'T ASK THEM
ABOUT MY EXISTENCE,
'CAUSE THEY'LL DENY IT.

07:32.085 --> 07:34.321
- OH, NO, I WOULDN'T.
- YEAH, AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

07:34.421 --> 07:35.956
IT'S "GOODBYE, DAVE,"
ISN'T IT?

07:36.056 --> 07:39.760
- YEAH, I WON'T TELL ANYONE.
- I'D APPRECIATE THAT, BRET.

07:39.860 --> 07:43.396
SO, MR. AND MRS. LI,
WHY DO YOU WANT TO
BE IN MY GANG?

07:43.497 --> 07:45.499
WE RUN THE INTERNET
CAFE DOWNSTAIRS.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.535
VANDALS GRAFFITI
OUR STORE WINDOW.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.436
WE WANT TO STOP THEM.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.705
( speaking Chinese )

07:55.308 --> 07:57.377
HE SAYS YOU HAVE
A KIND FACE.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.846
DAVE, DO YOU HAVE
ANY SPECIAL SKILLS?

07:58.946 --> 08:01.048
I CAN MAKE A WEAPON OUT
OF PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING

08:01.148 --> 08:03.617
THAT'S LYING AROUND.
LIKE WHEN I'M GARDENING,

08:03.717 --> 08:06.153
SOME A-HOLE TRIES
TO SNEAK UP AND TAKE ME OUT--

08:06.253 --> 08:08.188
WATERING CAN TIED
TO A HOSE.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.623
( mimics whooshing ) POP!

08:09.723 --> 08:12.593
COPS SHOW UP,
"WHAT'S THAT, OFFICER?

08:12.693 --> 08:16.063
NO, JUST WATERING
THE GERANIUMS."

08:16.163 --> 08:18.498
AND IN '54 I JOINED
THE MONKEY LORDS.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.601
AFTER THAT, THE ROCKERS,

08:20.701 --> 08:22.903
THE GENTLEMAN JIMS,
THE TSARS,

08:23.003 --> 08:25.906
THE STARS,
THE MIGHT MIDGETS
FROM QUEENS.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.341
SO YOU'VE HAD A LOT
OF GANG EXPERIENCE,
BASICALLY.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.944
THEY'RE ALL GANGS,
BIG DADDY!

08:33.881 --> 08:35.816
( dings )

08:38.518 --> 08:40.754
- GOING DOWN, MATE?
- YES, THANKS.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.923
- ARE YOU A KIWI?
- YES, HELLO.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.825
I'M MURRAY HEWITT
FROM THE NEW ZEALAND CONSULATE.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.728
- OH NO. A KIWI?
- ( chuckles ) OH NO.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.097
- UH-OH.
AUSTRALIAN. UH-OH.

08:50.197 --> 08:54.067
- AUSTRALIANS, EH?

08:54.167 --> 08:56.103
- WE'RE FROM
THE AUSTRALIAN CONSULATE.
- OH, REALLY?

08:56.203 --> 08:58.572
HOW ARE NEW ZEALAND'S
MINERAL EXPORTS, MURRAY?

08:58.672 --> 09:00.808
I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW.
IT'S NOT MY DEPARTMENT.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.410
AH. IS THAT THEM
THERE IN YOUR BRIEFCASE?

09:03.510 --> 09:06.179
- NO.
- NOT IN YOUR POCKET, MATE?

09:06.279 --> 09:07.781
- ( laughing )
- OH.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.783
MURRAY, I THINK
YOU DROPPED

09:09.883 --> 09:12.485
NEW ZEALAND'S MINERAL
EXPORTS FOR '08-'09.

09:12.586 --> 09:15.355
- ( men laughing )
- YEAH. OH YEAH.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.825
- NO, WE'RE JUST
HAVING A LAUGH, MATE.
- JUST PULLING YOUR TIT.

09:17.925 --> 09:21.528
YEAH, JUST PULLING YOUR BOOB.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU, MATE.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.430
- WE SHOULD HAVE
A BEER SOMETIME.
- YEAH, OKAY.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.298
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.602
( dinging )

09:37.444 --> 09:39.346
Bret:
OKAY, GUYS, THERE ARE
GANGSTERS OUT THERE

09:39.446 --> 09:41.414
THAT HAVE GOT
A MAJOR BEEF WITH ME,

09:41.514 --> 09:43.583
SO I WANT
A DEFENSE SCHEDULE.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.419
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT TIMES
WE'RE AVAILABLE. MRS. LI?

09:46.519 --> 09:49.489
WE CAN DO LUNCHTIMES
AND AFTER 7:00.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.692
OTHERWISE,
WE'RE BUSY IN THE SHOP.

09:51.792 --> 09:55.462
- OKAY. DAVE?
- I'M AVAILABLE
MOST DAYS AFTER 6:00

09:55.562 --> 09:58.265
BUT NOT WEEKENDS--
AND I CAN'T SAY WHY.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.233
DINNER WITH YOUR PARENTS?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.435
HUH! NO.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.171
I'M AVAILABLE
ALL THE TIME,

10:04.271 --> 10:06.807
BUT I LIKE TO GO
TO BED BY 8:00 AT NIGHT

10:06.907 --> 10:09.009
SO I CAN BUILD UP
MY Zs FOR THE NEXT DAY.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.144
OTHERWISE
I GET REAL TIRED.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.213
OH, AND I GOT
TO TAKE TOILET BREAKS.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.448
I HAVE A BLADDER THING.

10:15.548 --> 10:18.585
DOES ANYONE ELSE
HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT
THEY WANT TO ADD?

10:18.686 --> 10:21.989
YEAH, IF ANYONE
WANTS ME TO MAKE THEM
A PAIR OF THESE BAD BOYS,

10:22.089 --> 10:24.224
I'LL NEED
ABOUT A WEEK'S NOTICE.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.196
- CUP OF TEA?
- YES.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.264
- YEP.
- I'D BETTER NOT.

10:32.599 --> 10:33.701
OH YEAH. OKAY.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.403
( Mel whispering )
JEMAINE. JEMAINE!

10:36.503 --> 10:38.138
JEMAINE, HI.

10:38.238 --> 10:40.107
- HEY.
- I HAVE SOMETHING
FOR YOU. IT'S FAN ART.

10:40.207 --> 10:43.210
STOP THE CAR, DOUG!
WE'RE HERE.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.879
HOLD ON ONE SECOND, OKAY?
IT'S IN THE TRUNK.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.482
- HI, DOUG.
- HEY, JEMAINE.
WHERE'S BRET?

10:49.582 --> 10:53.020
- HE'S IN A GANG.
- WOW. ARE YOU IN IT?

10:53.120 --> 10:56.023
- I DON'T NEED
TO BE IN A GANG.
- HERE YOU GO.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.758
OH.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.228
- ( car honks )
- WHAT IS IT?

11:01.328 --> 11:03.864
YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.498
I DO.

11:05.598 --> 11:08.301
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU PRACTICALLY ADMITTED
THAT YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.838
- I-- DID I?
- OH MY GOD.

11:10.938 --> 11:13.173
- YOU DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL.
- NO, I L-- I LIKE IT.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.642
- DO YOU?
- YES.

11:15.743 --> 11:18.011
YOU LOVE IT!
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE LOVES IT!

11:18.111 --> 11:20.981
OH GOD, YOU SHOULD
HANG IT ON YOUR WALL

11:21.081 --> 11:23.917
SO YOU CAN SEE HOW STRONG
AND POWERFUL YOU ARE,

11:24.017 --> 11:26.686
LIKE THE GOD RA--
THE SUN GOD RA--

11:26.787 --> 11:30.157
- OR LIKE A PHARAOH.
- I'M NOT AS MUSCLEY AS THAT.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.292
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
- BE QUIET, DOUG.

11:32.392 --> 11:35.095
- BE QUIET, DOUG.
- DOUG OFFERED TO
POSE, BUT...

11:35.195 --> 11:38.298
( laughs )
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.601
ANYWAYS, I MADE ONE
OF BRET, BUT IT CAME
OUT A LITTLE WEIRD,

11:41.701 --> 11:43.904
- SO DON'T TELL HIM, OKAY?
- O-- OKAY.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.439
IT CAME OUT X-RATED,
ACTUALLY--

11:46.539 --> 11:50.811
SOME SHADOWING
ON THE CROTCH GOT
OUT OF HAND, BUT...

11:53.646 --> 11:56.984
- GOT IT?
- GOT IT.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.959
( both yelling )

12:06.059 --> 12:08.095
- BRET! BRET! BRET!
- WE GOT HIM GOOD!

12:08.195 --> 12:11.331
- VICTORY TO THE TOUGH BRETS!
- FALSE ALARM. IT'S JEMAINE.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.634
- IT'S MY FLATMATE.
SORRY, MATE.
- CAN ATTACK!

12:14.734 --> 12:16.569
( thunks )

12:16.669 --> 12:18.305
OH SHIT.
SORRY, MAN.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.842
I COULDN'T SEE
WHAT WAS GOING ON
FROM AROUND THE CORNER.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.244
- HEY, DAVE.
- Bret: HEY, SORRY, JEMAINE.

12:24.344 --> 12:27.414
WE WERE JUST EXPECTING
MISSY ELLIOT WAS GONNA
COME AND CHOP MY BODY OFF.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.783
THIS IS JOHNNYBOY, MRS. LI.
THIS IS JEMAINE.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.786
- HEY.
- LET'S GO BACK
TO COMBAT POSITIONS.

12:32.886 --> 12:36.456
GOOD ONE, DAVE.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

12:36.556 --> 12:38.325
OH, GOOD,
THANKS. YEAH.

12:39.726 --> 12:42.595
- HOW WAS YOUR DAY?
- UH, IT WAS GOOD.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.197
I'VE BEEN IN THE CEILING
MOST OF THE DAY.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.733
BRET, IS YOUR GANG
GONNA BE HERE ALL DAY?

12:46.834 --> 12:49.803
- ( yells )
- YEAH. WHY?

12:49.903 --> 12:51.738
WELL, I DON'T THINK
THERE'S A REAL THREAT.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.540
COULD YOU PUT THAT
IN THERE, PLEASE?

12:58.011 --> 13:01.448
RIGHT. BRET, WHAT'S THIS
I HEAR FROM ONE OF THE BAND
ABOUT YOU STARTING UP A GANG?

13:01.548 --> 13:04.484
- YOU TOLD ME TO
START UP A GANG.
- I SAID RAPPERS HAVE GANGS

13:04.584 --> 13:05.685
AND YOU SHOULDN'T
HASSLE RAPPERS.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.987
NO, YOU SAID
RAPPERS HAVE GANGS,

13:07.087 --> 13:08.388
SO I SHOULD START A GANG.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.722
TYPICAL--
YOU DIDN'T LISTEN.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.859
AND WHAT'S THIS I ALSO HEAR
FROM THE SAME SOURCE

13:11.959 --> 13:15.062
THAT YOUR GANG
ASSAULTED JEMAINE HERE

13:15.162 --> 13:17.965
IN A SURPRISE ATTACK?
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

13:18.065 --> 13:20.901
IS THIS SOME
SORT OF INITIATION
FOR JEMAINE INTO THE GANG?

13:21.001 --> 13:22.635
- NO, I'M NOT
IN THE GANG.
- NO.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.304
WHY AREN'T YOU
IN THE GANG?

13:24.404 --> 13:26.406
( mutters )
HE DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME
TO BE IN THE GANG.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.375
IT'S GOT TO STOP.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.977
THIS GANG
IS DISBANDONED.

13:30.077 --> 13:32.279
- NO. DIS-- WHAT?
- DISBANDONED.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.547
- DISBANDED YOU MEAN?
- ABANDONED?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.383
YUP, ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.750
- IT'S GONE.
- NO. NO.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.819
- YES. YES.
- NO. NO!

13:39.920 --> 13:41.188
- Both: YES!
- NO.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.023
- HOW ABOUT YES?
- HOW ABOUT NO?

13:43.123 --> 13:45.025
- WELL, I'D RATHER
YOU SAY YES.
- NO.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.393
- YES.
- UH, MURRAY?

13:46.493 --> 13:48.828
NOT NOW. I'M JUST IN
THE MIDDLE OF A DEBATE, GREG.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.597
- YES!
- NO!

13:50.697 --> 13:52.499
OH, GREG, IS THIS
ABOUT THE INTERCOM?

13:52.599 --> 13:55.969
NO, THE AUSTRALIAN CONSULATE
IS HOSTING DRINKS ON THURSDAY.

13:56.069 --> 13:58.805
- WE'VE ALL BEEN
ASKED TO ATTEND.
- OH.

13:58.906 --> 14:02.042
I DON'T REALLY
WANT TO GO TO THAT.
DO I HAVE TO GO?

14:02.142 --> 14:05.879
- I THINK SO, MURRAY.
- CAN I HAVE A "PLUS TWO"?

14:05.979 --> 14:07.714
I DON'T KNOW.
I'LL ASK.

14:07.814 --> 14:10.017
- THANKS, GREG.
- NO PROBLEM, MURRAY.

14:10.117 --> 14:12.452
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

14:12.552 --> 14:13.553
NICE GUY,
ISN'T HE-- GREG?

14:13.653 --> 14:15.022
- YEAH, HE IS.
- HE'S COOL.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.690
NOW, BRET, THE REASON
I'M COMING DOWN
ON YOU SO HARD

14:17.790 --> 14:21.962
ON THE GANG SITUATION IS--
I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
LESS OF ME HERE,

14:23.763 --> 14:25.899
BUT I ACTUALLY
USED TO BE IN A GANG.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.901
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- YOU DID?

14:28.001 --> 14:29.836
- YES.
- WHO WAS IN YOUR GANG,
YOU AND YOUR MOM?

14:29.937 --> 14:32.005
NO, JEMAINE. IT WAS ME,
MY BROTHER GRAEME,

14:32.105 --> 14:34.441
AND MY DAD GORDON.
MOM WASN'T EVEN
ALLOWED IN IT.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.110
- NO ONE KNEW WHY.
- SO WHAT DID YOU DO
IN YOUR GANG?

14:37.210 --> 14:40.413
WELL, WE WERE
A BIKEY GANG. WE USED TO
RIDE AROUND ON OUR BIKES.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.282
DAD WAS THE LEADER,

14:42.382 --> 14:44.351
GRAEME FOUND NICE PLACES
FOR US TO RIDE TO

14:44.451 --> 14:46.719
AND I WAS THE GUY
THAT LOOKED AFTER THE BAGS.

14:46.819 --> 14:50.457
MURRAY, IS THERE
ANYTHING BAND-RELATED
IN TODAY'S MEETING?

14:50.557 --> 14:53.893
YES, THERE IS,
ACTUALLY, BUT I HAVEN'T
FINISHED MY GANG STORIES.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.229
I'M GONNA JUST HEAD OFF--
I'VE GOT GANG PRACTICE.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.331
GANG PR-- WAIT.

14:58.431 --> 15:03.303
BRET-- MURRAY, CURRY.
ANY USE TO YOU?

15:05.805 --> 15:08.708
JEMAINE!
HEY. HI.

15:08.808 --> 15:12.145
- HEY, MEL.
- I WAS JUST WALKING
PAST YOUR PLACE

15:12.245 --> 15:14.681
AND I NOTICED
THAT THE FAN ART
I PAINTED FOR YOU

15:14.781 --> 15:17.117
WAS OUT ON THE STOOP
NEAR THE GARBAGE.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.719
- ( chuckles ) WHAT?
- OH, WHAT?

15:19.819 --> 15:22.522
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, JEMAINE,
I'D PREFER IF YOU TOLD ME.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.291
YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
DO YOU?

15:24.391 --> 15:27.427
- I-- I LIKE IT.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL JUST TAKE IT AWAY.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.462
I KNOW WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE
TO NOT BE WANTED.

15:29.562 --> 15:32.565
- MEL, I HAD TO
THROW IT AWAY!
- WHY?

15:32.665 --> 15:35.468
BECAUSE BRET WAS JEALOUS.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.404
REALLY?

15:37.504 --> 15:39.306
WAS HE GOING APESHIT?

15:39.406 --> 15:41.241
HE WENT APESHIT.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.243
I SWEAR ON DOUG'S LIFE
I WILL FIX THIS RIFT.

15:43.343 --> 15:47.080
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS WITH ME.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.618
( sighs )

15:51.718 --> 15:55.022
JUST-- JEMAINE,
STAY CLOSE.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.990
I AM CLOSE.
YOU'RE TOO CLOSE NOW.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.958
NO, BUT-- CLOSER.
PUT YOUR FEET
NEXT TO MINE

15:59.059 --> 16:02.462
THAT'S IT.
WE'RE TOGETHER,
ALL RIGHT?

16:02.562 --> 16:05.232
OKAY. YOU SAID THERE WAS
GONNA BE CHEESE.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.100
YOU SAID THERE WAS
GONNA BE FREE CHEESE.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.536
THERE WILL BE CHEESE.
OVER THERE. LOOK.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.738
RIGHT, LET'S GO AND GET
SOME CHEESE TOGETHER, OKAY?

16:11.838 --> 16:14.441
ALL RIGHT, GO.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.309
- NO, YOU'RE TOO CLOSE.
- NO, THAT'S GOOD.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.677
TOO CLOSE.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.620
- OH, NO.
- OH, THE MIGHTY MURRAY.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.157
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WHO'S THIS, MURRAY--
YOUR WIFE?

16:30.257 --> 16:33.026
NO, HIS WIFE--
HIS WIFE LEFT HIM.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.328
- JEMAINE!
- ( both whisper )

16:35.428 --> 16:37.164
IS THIS YOUR
GIRLFRIEND THEN,
IS IT, MURRAY?

16:37.264 --> 16:39.766
HUH. NO, I'M JUST
HIS PLUS ONE.

16:39.866 --> 16:42.235
OH. NO, WAIT,
I KNOW WHO IT IS.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.705
MISS NEW ZEALAND--
BEST LOOKING SHEILA
IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.575
- ( both laugh )
- SORRY, I DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE YOU

16:48.675 --> 16:50.277
WITHOUT THE CROWN
AND SASH.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.912
- CATCH YOU LATER.
- AH.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.981
WHO ARE THOSE GUYS?

16:55.082 --> 16:58.051
IDIOTS.
OFFICIAL IDIOTS, JEMAINE.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.753
LET'S JUST GET ALL
THEIR CHEESE AND GRAPES
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.190
NO, I DON'T HAVE TO
PUT UP WITH THIS SORT
OF BEHAVIOR.

17:03.290 --> 17:05.125
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- I'M GONNA TAKE IT
TO THE TOP.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.359
- NO, DON'T.
- I'M TAKING IT TO THE TOP.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.695
DON'T TAKE IT
TO THE TOP.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.065
- EXCUSE ME.
- YES? HELLO.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.801
AMBASSADOR,
I'M MURRAY HEWITT

17:14.901 --> 17:17.504
FROM THE NEW ZEALAND CONSULATE.
I'D LIKE TO COMPLAIN

17:17.604 --> 17:20.107
ABOUT THREE OF YOUR STAFF
MEMBERS AND THEIR BEHAVIOR.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.941
OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.112
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT
I TAKE THESE THINGS
VERY SERIOUSLY.

17:25.212 --> 17:28.248
OKAY, GOOD. THREE OF YOUR
STAFF MEMBERS HAVE BEEN

17:28.348 --> 17:31.050
INSULTING ME
AND MY COUNTRY
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.753
OH, WHAT EXACTLY
HAVE THEY BEEN SAYING?

17:33.853 --> 17:35.688
WELL, A NUMBER OF THINGS,

17:35.788 --> 17:37.124
BUT MOST RECENTLY
THEY'VE BEEN IMPLYING
MY FRIEND HERE

17:37.224 --> 17:39.392
- WAS MISS NEW ZEALAND.
- I'M NOT.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.561
- HE'S A MAN.
- IS THAT TRUE?

17:41.661 --> 17:45.798
- YES, I'M A MAN.
- WELL, LOOK, I'M REALLY
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.968
BUT I THOUGHT
FLOSSY THE SHEEP WON
MISS NEW ZEALAND EVERY YEAR.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.404
( all laughing )

17:51.504 --> 17:54.407
JUST JOKING, MURRAY.
JUST JOKING.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.577
GREG, WHAT ARE
YOU LAUGHING FOR?

17:57.677 --> 18:00.213
( folk music playing )

18:05.352 --> 18:09.456
* I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS

18:09.556 --> 18:14.161
* I'VE GOT
HURT FEELINGS *

18:17.330 --> 18:20.200
( distant siren
blaring )

18:20.300 --> 18:23.903
* I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS

18:24.003 --> 18:28.841
* I'VE GOT
HURT FEELINGS... *

18:28.941 --> 18:30.843
MEL, I COULD POSE
FOR YOU.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.213
OH, NO THANKS.
( chuckles )

18:33.313 --> 18:38.285
* I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS

18:38.385 --> 18:42.855
* I'VE GOT
HURT FEELINGS *

18:48.395 --> 18:52.332
* I'VE GOT
HURT FEELINGS *

18:52.432 --> 18:56.969
* I'VE GOT HURT FEELINGS

18:57.069 --> 19:01.208
* HURT FEELINGS

19:01.308 --> 19:04.811
* HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
MADE FUN OF BECAUSE OF
WHERE YOU WERE FROM? *

19:04.911 --> 19:08.581
* HAVE YOU EVER BEEN DISSED
OVER THE INTERCOM? *

19:08.681 --> 19:11.851
* HAVE YOU EVER FOUND A GIFT
YOU'VE GIVEN THROWN AWAY? *

19:11.951 --> 19:15.822
* HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN TOLD THAT YOU'RE
THE WRONG SHAPE? *

19:15.922 --> 19:19.459
* HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN TOLD THAT YOU'RE
MISS NEW ZEALAND? *

19:19.559 --> 19:23.730
* HAVE YOU EVER HAD
HURT FEELINGS? *

19:27.166 --> 19:29.336
COME ON, JEMAINE.
LET'S GO HOME.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.375
THANKS FOR BRINGING ME
TO THE PARTY, MURRAY.

19:35.475 --> 19:39.946
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
GOOD CHEESE, WASN'T IT?

19:40.046 --> 19:42.549
- Dave: WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?
- Bret: JUST STAY SHARP, MAN.

19:42.649 --> 19:44.417
- STAY SHARP.
- Dave: WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR?

19:44.517 --> 19:47.287
WE'RE LOOKING FOR,
BASICALLY, ALL RAPPERS.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.889
- ALL OF THEM?
- YUP, JUST-- YOU KNOW,

19:49.989 --> 19:54.494
- MOS DEF, ALL THE GUYS.
- MOS DEF, THE GUY FROM
"LAW & ORDER: SUV"?

19:54.594 --> 19:57.730
NO, THAT'S ICE CUBE,
BUT KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR HIM.

19:57.830 --> 20:00.199
NO NO, ICE CUBE WAS
IN "ARE WE THERE YET?"
AND "ARE WE DONE YET?"

20:00.300 --> 20:02.068
- NO.
- YEAH, HE WAS.

20:02.168 --> 20:05.238
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY
TALKING ABOUT METHOD MAN

20:05.338 --> 20:08.541
- FROM "MEET THE SPARTANS."
- WHO WAS HE IN "MEET
THE SPARTANS"?

20:08.641 --> 20:10.777
- HE WAS THE PERSIAN EMISSARY.
- NO, NOT HIM.

20:10.877 --> 20:14.213
- SNOOP DOGG--
THAT'S GOTTA BE IT.
- WHAT WAS HE IN?

20:14.314 --> 20:17.417
JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING.
HE'S IN "STARSKY & HUTCH."

20:17.517 --> 20:20.387
HE WAS IN "SOUL PLANE,"
"RACING STRIPES"--

20:20.487 --> 20:21.988
HE WAS THE VOICE
OF LIGHTNING THE RACEHORSE.

20:22.088 --> 20:24.824
- YEAH YEAH YEAH.

HIM ON YOUR ASS.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.494

BRET, DAVE,

20:40.707 --> 20:42.909

20:45.378 --> 20:47.680

20:50.417 --> 20:52.352
WELL, ON BEHALF

DO YOU WANT A DATE? *

22:05.725 --> 22:08.761

STAY COOL.

22:45.632 --> 22:46.833
POW.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.969
SO YOU SHOULD RESPECT
OTHER PEOPLE'S PROPERTY.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.571
- AH! YEAH.
- OW!

22:51.671 --> 22:53.640
- BRET, YOU JUST
KICKED A KID!
- SORRY.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.341
YOU COULD GET
10 YEARS FOR THAT.

22:55.442 --> 22:57.043
THAT'S IT,
WE'VE GOT TO BLOW, MAN.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.411
LET'S HAUL ASS FAST.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.212
I KNOW A PLACE
WE CAN HIDE TILL
THIS BLOWS OVER.

23:00.312 --> 23:02.582
- COME ON. YOU DIG?
- I THINK SO.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.286
WHAT THE HELL?

23:07.386 --> 23:10.457
WHEN DID
THIS THING GO UP?

23:10.557 --> 23:12.759
WHERE'S THE DAPPER DUKES'
HIDEOUT? IT WAS RIGHT HERE.

23:12.859 --> 23:16.228
YOU KNOW, WE LAID LOW
FOR THREE STRAIGHT
MONTHS BACK IN '58.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.898
JOHNNY, I THINK
THEY'VE PROBABLY
ALL RETIRED BY NOW.

23:20.132 --> 23:22.469
WHERE'D THEY GO?

23:25.404 --> 23:26.939
COME ON, JOHNNY,
LET'S-- LET'S GO.

23:27.039 --> 23:28.941
IT'S GETTING DARK.
WE SHOULD PROBABLY HEAD OFF.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.910
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT, LIL LOUIE.
I'M GETTING OLD.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.212
THIS GAME AIN'T NO GOOD
FOR ME NO MORE.

23:33.312 --> 23:36.048
I'M SORRY, LOUIE.
I'M OUT.

23:36.148 --> 23:39.085
SO LONG, LIL LOUIE.

23:40.553 --> 23:41.954
SO HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT WHO'S GONNA

23:42.054 --> 23:45.925
TAKE JOHNNYBOY'S PLACE
AS THE SECOND IN COMMAND?

23:46.025 --> 23:48.427
- Bret: HEY.

OF YOUR GANG?

23:48.528 --> 23:50.797
- Bret: UH--

23:50.897 --> 23:52.465
Bret:
I FOUND THAT ON
THE STEPS DOWNSTAIRS.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.467
I THOUGHT
YOU PAINTED IT.

23:54.567 --> 23:57.737
OH MY-- UGH.
OH MY GOD.

23:57.837 --> 24:00.873
YEAH, IT'S A PRETTY
WEIRD ONE.

24:03.209 --> 24:05.111
HOW COME

24:13.953 --> 24:16.823
BRET LOVES IT.
I SAW HIM BRING IT UP
A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.525
IS EVERYTHING COOL
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

24:18.625 --> 24:20.459
YEAH, IT'S ALL BETTER NOW.
THANK YOU.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.696
GREAT. WHAT ARE

24:23.796 --> 24:28.300
UH, JUST SHOWING EVERYONE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.069
WELL, I'D LOVE
TO COME WITH YOU.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.838
- OH.
- YEAH YEAH,

24:31.938 --> 24:34.340
LET'S WALK IT AROUND
AND GET PEOPLE'S REACTIONS.

24:34.440 --> 24:37.577
- UH...

24:37.677 --> 24:40.580
BIG ART OPENING--

24:40.680 --> 24:43.783

24:43.883 --> 24:47.520
- WHO IS IT?
- IT'S THE POLICE.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.188
LOOK, IF MY MOM--

24:49.288 --> 24:51.223

STALL 'EM.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.965
- HELLO.

24:59.065 --> 25:01.601
OF A KID BEING
KICKED ON THE STREET
BY A GROUP OF ADULTS.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.903
OH, YES.
THAT WAS ME.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.605
THEY SAID IT WAS
A GROUP OF ADULTS.

25:05.705 --> 25:08.107
UM, THAT WAS MY GANG.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.643
- OKAY, SO WHY'D
YOU KICK THE BOY?
- ( Dave thuds )

25:10.743 --> 25:14.581
- ( car alarm blaring )
- WELL, I GUESS THAT
WAS GANG-RELATED.

25:14.681 --> 25:16.382
WELL, IN THE FUTURE,
I SUGGEST YOU DON'T
KICK CHILDREN.

25:16.482 --> 25:18.651
- MM-HMM.
- WE'LL LET THIS GO
BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE

25:18.751 --> 25:20.286
THAT PARTICULAR KID,
BUT WE'VE GOT OUR
EYES ON YOU.

25:20.386 --> 25:21.921
OKAY, OFFICER.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.890
THANK YOU.

25:26.092 --> 25:27.760
WHEW!

25:29.128 --> 25:30.863
DAVE, THEY'VE GONE.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.133
DAVE?

25:37.003 --> 25:40.072
SEE, BRET? THIS IS
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU START RAPPING.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.575
- GOOD ONE. LOOK AT WHAT
YOU'VE DONE TO DAVID.
- ( heart monitor beeping )

25:42.675 --> 25:44.677
BRET, I WANT OUT--
I WANT OUT OF THE GANG.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.513
JOHNNYBOY'S GONE,
MR. AND MRS. LI ARE GONE.

25:47.614 --> 25:50.349
- WHERE HAVE THEY GONE?
- THEY'VE GONE TO TAIWAN
TO VISIT THEIR SON PHANG.

25:50.449 --> 25:51.718
HE JUST GRADUATED
DENTAL SCHOOL.

25:51.818 --> 25:53.853
- DAVE--
- IT'S OVER, MAN!
I'M OUT.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.722
WITHOUT YOU, MAN,
I'VE GOT NO ONE.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.556
MAYBE THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE
WHO'LL BE IN YOUR GANG.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.892
- SOMEONE WHOM
YOU HAVEN'T ASKED.
- WHO?

25:59.992 --> 26:01.761
JEMAINE'S TALKING
ABOUT JEMAINE, BRET.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.529
YOU COULD'VE ASKED HIM--
OR ME-- BUT YOU DIDN'T.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.732
- YOU DIDN'T ASK US.
- DO YOU GUYS WANT TO
BE IN THE GANG?

26:05.832 --> 26:08.367
- YES!
- YEAH. I'D LIKE TO, YEAH.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.603
OH, THAT'S COOL.
THEN THERE'S FOUR OF US.

26:10.703 --> 26:13.706
NO, THERE'S THREE,
'CAUSE I QUIT

26:13.806 --> 26:16.475
AND SO SHOULD YOU.
AND YOU, JEMAINE,

26:16.575 --> 26:17.910
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

26:18.010 --> 26:22.014
DAVE'S RIGHT. SORRY, GUYS,
I'M OUT OF THE GANG.

26:22.114 --> 26:24.250
WELL, IF YOU'RE OUT
AND YOU'RE OUT, THEN I'M OUT.

26:24.350 --> 26:25.752
- REALLY?
- YEAH, I'M OUT.

26:25.852 --> 26:29.355
YOU'RE OUT AS WELL?
WELL, I'M NOT LEAVING.

26:29.455 --> 26:31.423
SO THAT'S IT--
I'M IN.

26:31.523 --> 26:33.960
I'M THE GANG.
I'M THE TOUGH BRETS.

26:34.060 --> 26:39.065
- ( funk music playing )
- THIS IS A PAINTING
I DID OF JEMAINE.

26:39.165 --> 26:43.002
AS YOU CAN SEE,
I PRETTY MUCH GOT
THE HANDSOMENESS.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.004
THAT'S JEMAINE.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.473
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT,
HE CAN TAKE HIS SHIRT OFF

26:47.573 --> 26:48.808
AND YOU CAN
BE SURE ABOUT IT.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.509
OH, HELLO.
THIS IS MY PAINTING.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.411
I DID THIS PAINTING.
THIS IS JEMAINE.

26:52.511 --> 26:53.913
THIS IS HIM.
HE'S MY MUSE.

26:54.013 --> 26:56.048
HE IS MY MUSE
AND MY JOY.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.284
PEOPLE DON'T
APPRECIATE ART, DO THEY?

26:58.384 --> 27:00.052
UNBELIEVABLE.
