WEBVTT

00:08.742 --> 00:10.266
Sorry I'm late,

00:10.343 --> 00:12.277
but I have a very good excuse.

00:12.345 --> 00:13.676
Picture this:

00:13.747 --> 00:15.840
I'm just getting ready
to leave the Mess Hall

00:15.915 --> 00:18.179
when Ensign Wildman
goes into labor.

00:18.251 --> 00:20.879
What else could I do
but deliver the baby?

00:20.954 --> 00:22.546
Oh, you should
have been there, Harry.

00:22.622 --> 00:25.853
There is nothing like bringing
a new life into the world.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.586
I think I missed my calling.

00:29.863 --> 00:30.989
What if I told you

00:31.064 --> 00:33.294
the turbolift got stuck
on Deck 6?

00:33.366 --> 00:35.197
This is the third time
you've been late this week,

00:35.268 --> 00:36.292
Mr. Paris.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.462
It won't happen again.

00:38.538 --> 00:41.473
Commander, I am picking up
a distress call

00:41.541 --> 00:43.008
on one of the upper
subspace bands.

00:43.143 --> 00:44.337
What's the source?

00:44.411 --> 00:45.844
A small spacecraft.

00:45.912 --> 00:47.243
No weapon systems.

00:47.313 --> 00:48.905
One life-form aboard.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.609
Extremely weak life signs.

00:50.683 --> 00:51.911
Slow to half impulse.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.783
According to the bioscanner,
it's a Vidiian female.

00:54.854 --> 00:56.549
Open a channel.

00:56.623 --> 00:58.181
No response.

00:58.258 --> 00:59.589
She may be too sick.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.660
Or maybe
it's some kind of trick.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.630
Preliminary scans show no other
Vidiian ships in this sector.

01:05.698 --> 01:07.598
It is unlikely
that this is a trap.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.328
Commander Chakotay,
notify the Doctor.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.267
Mr. Kim, beam the woman
to Sick Bay.

01:11.337 --> 01:12.463
Aye, Captain.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:23.383 --> 01:24.350
Her renal organs

01:24.417 --> 01:26.544
are functioning
at 20 percent of normal

01:26.619 --> 01:29.247
and her cardiovascular system
is on the verge of collapse.

01:29.322 --> 01:31.916
20 milligrams of lectrazine.

01:38.264 --> 01:41.392
Cardiovascular and renal
systems are stabilizing,

01:41.468 --> 01:43.436
but her neural patterns
are fading.

01:48.508 --> 01:49.805
What is it?

01:49.876 --> 01:51.969
In her parietal lobe.

01:52.045 --> 01:54.172
It looks like
some sort of implant.

01:57.317 --> 02:00.980
It's a very complex web
of bio-neural circuitry,

02:01.054 --> 02:02.282
nano-fibers.

02:02.355 --> 02:04.653
Could this be
what's causing the problem?

02:04.724 --> 02:06.316
On the contrary.

02:06.392 --> 02:07.882
According to these readings,

02:07.961 --> 02:10.862
the device is actually
storing her synaptic patterns,

02:10.930 --> 02:12.192
processing them

02:12.265 --> 02:14.130
and transmitting
neuro-electrical impulses

02:14.200 --> 02:15.633
to the rest of her systems.

02:21.841 --> 02:24.105
Are you saying it's some kind
of artificial brain?

02:24.177 --> 02:26.270
No.

02:26.346 --> 02:29.782
I'd say it's more like
a neuro-cortical stimulator

02:29.849 --> 02:32.477
designed to supplement
the higher brain functions.

02:32.552 --> 02:34.247
But it's not working anymore.

02:34.320 --> 02:37.517
From what I can tell, the
implant itself is functioning,

02:37.590 --> 02:39.558
but it's connected
to mostly dead nerve cells.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.355
If we don't do something
quickly,

02:41.427 --> 02:43.827
she'll be brain dead
in a matter of minutes.

02:43.897 --> 02:46.559
What about trying to stimulate
cell regeneration

02:46.633 --> 02:48.567
with a high dosage
of inaprovaline?

02:48.635 --> 02:50.159
Very impressive, Kes,

02:50.236 --> 02:52.136
but I think
it's too late for that.

02:53.606 --> 02:55.733
Get me a high-frequency
RF transmitter.

02:55.808 --> 02:58.038
You're going to have
to hurry, Kes.

02:58.111 --> 03:00.011
The patient's brain function
is diminishing rapidly.

03:04.584 --> 03:07.314
Now... set
the delta band frequency

03:07.387 --> 03:10.379
of the holo-emitter
to 8.6 tetrahertz.

03:10.456 --> 03:12.014
What are we doing, exactly?

03:12.091 --> 03:13.786
Transferring the patient's
synaptic patterns

03:13.860 --> 03:15.953
into the holo-buffer
before they degrade completely.

03:17.897 --> 03:19.524
Is there enough storage capacity

03:19.599 --> 03:21.931
in the holo-matrix for such
complex data patterns?

03:22.068 --> 03:24.332
There's enough capacity
for my program, isn't there?

03:24.404 --> 03:27.931
And my program contains over
50 million gigaquads of data,

03:28.007 --> 03:29.975
which, I don't have to tell you,
is considerably more

03:30.043 --> 03:32.204
than the most highly-developed
humanoid brains.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.576
What good is preserving
her synaptic patterns

03:34.647 --> 03:36.376
if there is no body?

03:36.449 --> 03:38.076
I'm creating a holographic body.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.813
Not only will we be able
to communicate

03:40.887 --> 03:42.821
with the patient, but we'll
have an accurate model

03:42.889 --> 03:43.878
of healthy Vidiian

03:43.957 --> 03:46.448
physiology that will aid
in treating her actual body.

03:46.526 --> 03:50.690
Computer, project the patient's
skeletal structure.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.463
Now add internal organs.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.794
Add musculature.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.940
Now apply epidermal layers.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.475
Computer,
use transporter records

04:09.549 --> 04:11.915
to recreate
the patient's clothing.

06:14.006 --> 06:15.906
According to her ship's
navigational logs,

06:16.008 --> 06:19.171
the woman was en route
to a remote Vidiian colony.

06:19.245 --> 06:20.439
Are we anywhere near it?

06:20.513 --> 06:22.344
It's about ten light-years away.

06:22.415 --> 06:25.543
We should be in the general
vicinity in about 22 days.

06:25.618 --> 06:26.744
Assuming she survives

06:26.819 --> 06:29.413
and we can take adequate
security precautions,

06:29.489 --> 06:32.083
we'll turn her over to her
people when we get there.

06:32.158 --> 06:33.716
Captain.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.317
Is there something wrong?

06:35.395 --> 06:38.125
I wanted to talk to you
about Lieutenant Paris.

06:38.197 --> 06:41.428
His attitude lately's been
less than professional.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.435
I've noticed.

06:43.503 --> 06:46.028
I know crew discipline's
my responsibility,

06:46.105 --> 06:49.472
but, in this case, I thought
I should let you get involved

06:49.542 --> 06:50.975
before I took any action.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.101
In a way, Paris has been

06:52.178 --> 06:53.736
your personal
reclamation project.

06:55.114 --> 06:58.311
I appreciate your bringing this
to my attention, Commander,

06:58.384 --> 07:02.445
but I trust you to handle
the problem any way you see fit.

07:09.228 --> 07:12.220
Chief Medical Officer's Log,
supplemental.

07:12.298 --> 07:13.595
Test results indicate

07:13.666 --> 07:16.260
that the holographic body
is functioning normally.

07:16.335 --> 07:18.826
The patient's synaptic patterns
appear to be stable,

07:18.905 --> 07:21.032
so I'm now ready
to begin transferring

07:21.107 --> 07:23.132
her cognitive
and motor processes.

07:38.858 --> 07:41.019
Who are you?

07:41.194 --> 07:42.821
I'm the Chief Medical Officer

07:42.895 --> 07:45.056
of the Federation Starship
Voyager.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.895
We received your distress call
and brought you aboard.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.776
What have you done to me?

07:57.844 --> 07:59.141
It's quite simple really.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.271
I used the undamaged
chromosomes in your cerebellum

08:01.347 --> 08:03.815
to recreate
your original DNA code,

08:03.883 --> 08:05.350
and then programmed the computer

08:05.418 --> 08:08.546
to project a holographic
template based on that genome.

08:08.621 --> 08:10.452
Holographic?

08:10.523 --> 08:14.254
A three-dimensional projection
of light and energy.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.488
See for yourself.

08:32.544 --> 08:34.910
Your neural patterns
were degrading rapidly.

08:34.981 --> 08:36.039
It was too late

08:36.115 --> 08:37.844
to expect results
from inaprovaline,

08:37.917 --> 08:40.385
so I was forced to improvise,

08:40.453 --> 08:43.751
not that it would have occurred
to just any physician.

08:50.763 --> 08:53.527
Why are you crying?

08:55.167 --> 08:57.067
I'm sorry. I...

08:57.136 --> 08:58.728
I thought you'd be pleased.

08:58.804 --> 09:00.101
I am.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.843
I just never expected
to look healthy again.

09:04.911 --> 09:07.402
I've been sick for so long.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.381
I'll need
a complete medical history.

09:13.452 --> 09:14.976
How long have you
been ill exactly?

09:15.054 --> 09:18.455
I was first diagnosed
with the phage when I was seven.

09:18.524 --> 09:21.516
And when did you begin receiving
replacement tissue?

09:21.594 --> 09:23.323
About that same time.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.057
At first, it was hard
to get used to the changes,

09:25.131 --> 09:27.861
but it happened so often
that after a while,

09:27.967 --> 09:29.730
I almost stopped noticing.

09:29.802 --> 09:31.292
l-I never...

09:33.439 --> 09:36.135
I never thought
I'd see myself again.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.280
Thank you.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.146
This is the most
extraordinary thing

09:45.217 --> 09:46.684
anyone has ever done for me.

09:46.752 --> 09:47.912
I wouldn't be too grateful.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.580
There are serious limitations
to being a hologram.

09:50.656 --> 09:53.090
First of all, we can only exist
within environments

09:53.159 --> 09:56.390
equipped with holo-emitters,
such as this Sick Bay.

09:56.462 --> 09:58.396
You mean, you're...

09:58.464 --> 10:00.591
I'm this ship's emergency
medical holographic program.

10:00.666 --> 10:03.134
You're a computer simulation?

10:04.337 --> 10:08.034
An incredibly sophisticated
computer simulation.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.438
I'm sorry.

10:12.311 --> 10:14.211
What did you say your name was?

10:16.882 --> 10:18.543
I don't have a name.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.609
It wasn't part
of my original program.

10:20.686 --> 10:23.382
However, you, I'm sure,
have one.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.117
Danara.

10:25.191 --> 10:26.453
Danara Pel.

10:26.525 --> 10:27.651
Well, Miss Pel,

10:27.727 --> 10:29.957
may I ask what someone
with an illness like yours

10:30.029 --> 10:32.623
was doing alone in space
with no access to medical care?

10:32.698 --> 10:33.756
I was helping to treat

10:33.833 --> 10:35.801
an outbreak of the phage
on Fina Prime.

10:35.868 --> 10:37.893
I was on my way
back to my home colony,

10:37.970 --> 10:40.666
but it's a long journey
and my condition got worse.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.208
You're a medical practitioner
of some kind?

10:43.275 --> 10:44.503
A hematologist.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.011
Well, then, perhaps,
given your expertise,

10:47.146 --> 10:49.171
you can help me
with your treatment.

10:49.248 --> 10:51.148
My treatment?

10:51.217 --> 10:53.014
I feel fine.

10:53.085 --> 10:54.746
Unfortunately,
that's only temporary.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.720
Your synaptic patterns
will eventually degrade

10:56.789 --> 10:58.381
if we don't get them out
of the pattern buffers

10:58.457 --> 10:59.389
and back into your brain.

10:59.458 --> 11:00.482
How long?

11:00.593 --> 11:02.561
A few days.
Perhaps a week.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.062
I see.

11:04.130 --> 11:06.325
Your real body is in stasis.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.458
As you can see,
we have to find a way

11:08.534 --> 11:09.865
to repair
your damaged neural tissue.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.772
Is something wrong?

11:17.076 --> 11:18.407
It's nothing.

11:18.477 --> 11:20.445
I'm eager to discuss treatments.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.980
Of course.

11:35.961 --> 11:37.223
The procedure is quite simple.

11:37.296 --> 11:38.991
I'll drill an opening
into your skull

11:39.065 --> 11:41.192
precisely two millimeters
in diameter,

11:41.267 --> 11:42.700
and then use a neuralyte probe

11:42.768 --> 11:44.599
to extract a sample
of your parietal lobe

11:44.670 --> 11:46.035
weighing
approximately one gram.

11:46.105 --> 11:48.232
It doesn't sound simple to me.

11:48.307 --> 11:49.604
I still have nightmares

11:49.675 --> 11:51.165
about what those people
did to me.

11:51.243 --> 11:53.507
And now you want
to crack open my head,

11:53.579 --> 11:55.308
cut out a piece of my brain

11:55.381 --> 11:56.609
and give it to her?

11:56.682 --> 11:58.547
Your experience
in the Vidiian prison

11:58.617 --> 12:01.609
suggests Klingon DNA
is resistant to the phage.

12:01.687 --> 12:04.315
Losing a small amount of neural
tissue is inconsequential.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.322
Not to me, it isn't.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.790
Yet that same tissue,

12:06.859 --> 12:09.487
grafted onto the patient's brain
and stimulated to grow,

12:09.562 --> 12:12.156
will significantly slow
the spread of her infection.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.358
If we can increase the grafted
tissue mass quickly enough,

12:14.433 --> 12:16.424
we can transfer
her synaptic patterns

12:16.502 --> 12:18.970
back into her brain before they
degrade in the holo-buffer.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.538
It won't cure the phage,

12:20.606 --> 12:23.598
but it should
prolong her life considerably.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.667
Please change
into a surgical gown

12:25.745 --> 12:26.905
and lie down
on bio-bed number one.

12:26.979 --> 12:27.911
I am not going...

12:27.980 --> 12:29.345
Excuse me.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.583
I just want to say that...

12:34.653 --> 12:36.780
I've read about the experiments
that were done on you.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.983
What you went through
must have been very traumatic.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.820
That is an understatement.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.292
I'm sure it is.

12:42.361 --> 12:44.591
Please understand, this disease

12:44.663 --> 12:46.927
has been killing my people
for hundreds of years.

12:46.999 --> 12:49.559
Trying to stop it
has become an obsession

12:49.635 --> 12:51.330
and many of our politicians
and scientists

12:51.403 --> 12:52.427
have never developed

12:52.505 --> 12:55.497
compassion for the people
who keep us alive.

12:55.574 --> 12:58.441
As much as I want
to go on living,

12:58.511 --> 13:01.412
I have accepted the fact
that I will die soon.

13:03.315 --> 13:07.217
I only want your help
if you are willing to give it.

13:09.121 --> 13:13.820
Of course, I... I'd like
to help you if I can.

13:16.428 --> 13:19.454
If you have any questions at all
about the procedure,

13:19.532 --> 13:23.298
I'd... I'd be happy
to answer them for you.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.305
I'll go and get changed.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.182
I've finished ingrafting
the Klingon neural tissue

13:39.251 --> 13:40.684
to your cerebral cortex.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.983
Now, all I have to do
is create an axonal pathway

13:43.055 --> 13:45.285
between that tissue
and your basal ganglia.

13:45.357 --> 13:47.086
Your technique
is very impressive.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.820
It's all part
of my programming.

13:48.894 --> 13:50.725
For example, this exact
procedure was developed

13:50.796 --> 13:53.230
by Dr. Leonard McCoy
in the year 2253.

13:53.299 --> 13:55.358
I'm equipped with
the collective medical knowledge

13:55.434 --> 13:57.800
of more than 3,000 cultures.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.566
Additionally, as you see here,

14:00.639 --> 14:03.540
my imaging system
allows me to perform

14:03.609 --> 14:04.906
and, in many cases, improve upon

14:04.977 --> 14:07.172
the most delicate
tactile maneuvers

14:07.246 --> 14:10.306
required by a dizzying array
of surgical procedures.

14:10.382 --> 14:11.542
Incredible.

14:11.617 --> 14:12.709
It is, isn't it?

14:12.785 --> 14:15.583
Hand me the submicron
suture, please.

14:19.258 --> 14:20.987
There. That should do it.

14:21.994 --> 14:24.087
Ah. Excellent work, Doctor.

14:24.163 --> 14:25.824
I was only assisting.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.661
Nonetheless,
that assistance was invaluable.

14:27.733 --> 14:29.325
It could be two or three days

14:29.401 --> 14:31.096
before we'll know
if the graft will hold.

14:31.170 --> 14:34.071
In the meantime, perhaps
I should deactivate

14:34.139 --> 14:35.800
your program temporarily.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.433
Do you have to?

14:37.509 --> 14:40.137
It would slow the degradation
of your synaptic patterns.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.406
But I have so much energy.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.469
I don't know.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.880
Maybe it's the excitement
of the surgery, or...

14:44.950 --> 14:47.077
or maybe it's this new body.

14:47.152 --> 14:50.280
What I'd really like to do
is take a walk

14:50.356 --> 14:52.085
and see the rest of your ship.

14:52.157 --> 14:54.819
Unfortunately,
that's not possible.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.954
However, if you're looking
for something to do,

14:58.030 --> 14:59.657
please feel free
to use my office

14:59.732 --> 15:01.256
to access our medical database.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.164
You'll find several
interesting texts

15:03.202 --> 15:04.669
on comparative endocrinology.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.965
All right.

15:06.038 --> 15:07.767
Thank you.

15:09.575 --> 15:13.568
On second thought, there is
someplace else we could go.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.051
It's wonderful.

15:24.123 --> 15:25.920
If I had a place
like this to go to,

15:26.025 --> 15:27.424
I'd be there every day.

15:27.493 --> 15:30.053
Don't your people have
recreational facilities?

15:30.129 --> 15:32.290
Congregating in groups
is strictly regulated.

15:32.364 --> 15:33.388
Congregating in groups
is strictly regulated.

15:33.465 --> 15:35.262
It's considered to be
a threat to public health.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.598
A wise policy.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.194
I suppose.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.239
Sometimes, I think my
people spend so much time

15:41.307 --> 15:42.638
trying to save lives,

15:42.708 --> 15:44.539
they don't know
how to live anymore.

15:44.610 --> 15:48.478
Doctor, aren't you going
to introduce me to your date?

15:48.547 --> 15:49.912
She is not my date.

15:49.982 --> 15:51.347
She's my patient.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.815
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize...

15:54.887 --> 15:57.913
Mr. Neelix,
this is Dr. Danara Pel.

15:57.990 --> 15:59.423
As Chief Morale Officer,

15:59.491 --> 16:02.483
may I be the first
to welcome you to Voyager.

16:02.594 --> 16:05.188
Madame, your loveliness

16:05.230 --> 16:07.858
illuminates
our dark little cavern.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.525
May I have the pleasure
of this next dance?

16:09.601 --> 16:11.501
Go away immediately.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.765
Both of you.
You're disturbing my patient.

16:13.839 --> 16:17.297
You are just jealous
because you cannot dance.

16:18.711 --> 16:19.678
Let's go.

16:19.745 --> 16:21.679
You're making the lady nervous.

16:21.747 --> 16:24.238
Nice to meet you.

16:26.118 --> 16:27.449
I apologize.

16:27.519 --> 16:29.783
No. They were just being nice.

16:29.855 --> 16:31.413
Irritating, isn't it?

16:32.558 --> 16:36.426
I guess I'm just not used
to... so much attention.

16:37.696 --> 16:39.630
Where I come from,

16:39.698 --> 16:41.097
when you're as sick as I am,

16:41.166 --> 16:44.932
people... healthy people...
stay away from you.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.163
I guess...

16:48.774 --> 16:50.639
I...

16:50.709 --> 16:51.801
I forgot for a second

16:51.877 --> 16:53.868
that I don't look
like that anymore.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.642
It's a natural response.

16:56.715 --> 16:59.878
All this talk about me.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.978
There's still so much
I'd like to know about you.

17:03.088 --> 17:05.318
There's not much to tell,
really.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.415
My program was developed
by Dr. Louis Zimmerman

17:07.492 --> 17:09.426
in a lab on Jupiter Station.

17:09.494 --> 17:12.862
I was activated
on stardate 48308.

17:12.931 --> 17:16.867
Since that time, I've performed
347 medical exams,

17:16.969 --> 17:21.098
healed 1 1 compound fractures,
performed three appendectomies

17:21.173 --> 17:23.141
and, in my greatest feat
of medical prowess,

17:23.208 --> 17:26.665
I once cured Mr. Neelix
of an acute case of the hiccups.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.741
You're very funny.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.077
I am?

17:32.684 --> 17:35.710
Well, several clinical studies

17:35.788 --> 17:37.688
have shown humor
to be very therapeutic.

17:37.756 --> 17:39.621
Consider it
part of your treatment.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.686
What is it?

17:44.763 --> 17:46.924
It's, uh... just that I...

17:48.634 --> 17:50.761
I haven't laughed
in a very long time.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.434
Thank you.

17:58.343 --> 18:01.471
What did that man mean
when he said you can't "dance"?

18:03.182 --> 18:04.843
That's dancing.

18:11.056 --> 18:13.047
And you can't do it?

18:14.159 --> 18:16.286
It's not part of my programming.

18:16.361 --> 18:17.726
Oh.

18:17.796 --> 18:19.024
I see.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.708
Well, Dr. Pel...

18:34.780 --> 18:36.748
Please, call me Danara.

18:36.815 --> 18:40.080
As you wish... Danara.

18:40.152 --> 18:42.279
And what about you?

18:42.354 --> 18:43.821
What should I call you?

18:43.889 --> 18:45.823
Well, as I said...

18:45.891 --> 18:47.552
I know.
You don't have a name.

18:49.661 --> 18:51.822
Would it be all right
if I gave you one?

18:51.897 --> 18:54.297
Well, I...

18:54.366 --> 18:55.697
How about...

18:57.302 --> 18:59.429
Shmullus?

19:01.206 --> 19:02.298
Shmullus?

19:02.374 --> 19:04.239
It was my uncle's name.

19:04.309 --> 19:07.039
He used to make me laugh, too.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.075
Doctor...

19:11.150 --> 19:12.981
Shmullus.

19:13.051 --> 19:15.952
I think I like
the sound of that.

19:33.238 --> 19:34.705
Well...

19:35.841 --> 19:37.274
here we are.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.173
Yes.

19:39.244 --> 19:40.711
Here we are.

19:42.114 --> 19:43.411
Danara, I think we should...

19:43.482 --> 19:44.540
Yes?

19:44.616 --> 19:46.914
Deactivate your program
for at least eight hours.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.552
If you think it's best.

19:49.621 --> 19:51.350
I do.

19:51.423 --> 19:52.754
All right, then.

19:52.824 --> 19:54.086
All right.

19:54.159 --> 19:55.091
Computer...

19:55.160 --> 19:56.787
-Shmullus?
-Yes?

19:58.263 --> 20:01.027
I had a wonderful time.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.930
I'm pleased.

20:06.071 --> 20:08.062
Thank you...

20:08.140 --> 20:09.801
for...

20:09.875 --> 20:11.467
everything.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.602
Thank you for...

20:15.314 --> 20:16.713
giving me a name.

20:30.329 --> 20:32.820
Uh... well...

20:32.898 --> 20:34.798
good night, Danara.

20:34.866 --> 20:37.300
Good night...

20:37.369 --> 20:38.768
Shmullus.

20:40.639 --> 20:45.804
Computer, deactivate
Vidiian program Alpha.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.126
Mind if I join you?

21:20.912 --> 21:22.470
So how are things, Tom?

21:22.547 --> 21:24.310
Excuse me?

21:24.383 --> 21:25.975
How have you been
feeling lately?

21:26.051 --> 21:27.518
Is something bothering you?

21:30.422 --> 21:31.912
Oh, no offense, Commander,

21:31.990 --> 21:35.323
but why the sudden concern
for my feelings?

21:35.394 --> 21:37.089
Well, you've been moody lately,

21:37.162 --> 21:38.459
indifferent to your duties.

21:38.530 --> 21:40.623
To be honest,
you don't seem to be

21:40.699 --> 21:42.792
taking your job very seriously.

21:42.868 --> 21:43.994
If you've got a problem,

21:44.102 --> 21:45.569
I'd like to know what it is.

21:48.874 --> 21:51.308
Yeah, I've got a problem.

21:51.376 --> 21:53.241
My problem is you.

21:57.282 --> 21:59.011
You care to elaborate?

21:59.084 --> 22:02.679
You tell me
I don't take my job seriously,

22:02.788 --> 22:05.086
but half the time,
you don't let me do my job.

22:05.123 --> 22:06.681
What's that supposed to mean?

22:06.758 --> 22:09.226
It means that you
don't trust my judgment.

22:09.294 --> 22:11.159
You don't allow me
to take initiative.

22:11.229 --> 22:12.161
Remember last week?

22:12.230 --> 22:13.629
I suggested
that we might save time

22:13.699 --> 22:15.496
by traveling through
that emissions nebula.

22:15.567 --> 22:17.057
But what did you say?

22:17.135 --> 22:20.571
"Oh, no, that's not the way we
do things on this ship."

22:20.639 --> 22:23.267
Look, sometimes I'm not going
to agree with your suggestions,

22:23.342 --> 22:25.833
but making decisions
is part of being a leader.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.936
Maybe someday
you'll understand that.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.275
Being a leader also means
knowing when to give your people

22:30.349 --> 22:32.977
a little leeway
and let them be creative.

22:33.051 --> 22:35.144
We might as well put this ship
on autopilot

22:35.220 --> 22:37.381
for all the freedom
you give me to do my job.

22:37.456 --> 22:40.254
I didn't come here for a lecture
from you on how to do my job.

22:40.325 --> 22:42.987
Yeah, well, I know you don't put
much stock in my opinion,

22:43.061 --> 22:46.326
so maybe you should talk
to some of these people.

22:46.398 --> 22:47.831
Because I'm not the only one
around here

22:47.899 --> 22:49.059
who's got a problem with you.

22:50.168 --> 22:52.693
Now, if there's nothing else...

22:52.771 --> 22:54.170
sir...

22:54.239 --> 22:55.672
I'd like to be excused.

22:58.643 --> 23:00.634
Sure, Paris.

23:00.712 --> 23:02.077
You're excused.

23:08.620 --> 23:11.487
Dissension among
the Voyager crew.

23:11.556 --> 23:14.923
Maje Culluh will find that
very interesting.

23:15.026 --> 23:16.584
Good work, Mr. Jonas.

23:16.661 --> 23:18.595
Now, there's something else
we'd like you to do.

23:18.663 --> 23:22.326
We want you to create a small
accident, which will damage

23:22.401 --> 23:23.663
Voyager's warp coils.

23:23.735 --> 23:24.929
Why?

23:25.036 --> 23:27.664
There's no need to concern
yourself with that.

23:27.739 --> 23:31.140
You just... plan the accident.

23:31.209 --> 23:32.506
We'll let you know exactly
when we want it to happen.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.943
We'll let you know exactly
when we want it to happen.

23:35.013 --> 23:37.948
Do we understand each other?

23:38.016 --> 23:40.075
I want to talk to Seska.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.483
I'm afraid Maje Culluh...

23:41.553 --> 23:42.645
You tell Maje Culluh

23:42.721 --> 23:44.621
that I won't do anything
to damage Voyager,

23:44.689 --> 23:46.418
and if he has
a problem with that,

23:46.491 --> 23:48.482
tell him to have
Seska contact me.

23:54.699 --> 23:55.996
Doctor, when you have a minute.

23:56.067 --> 23:58.661
I'm running a level-2
self-diagnostic right now.

23:58.737 --> 24:00.466
I'll be there
as soon as I'm finished.

24:00.572 --> 24:02.540
Why are you running
a diagnostic?

24:02.574 --> 24:05.236
I've been experiencing
periodic lapses in concentration

24:05.310 --> 24:07.335
and difficulty handling objects.

24:07.412 --> 24:09.175
There may be a malfunction

24:09.247 --> 24:11.374
in my tactile acuity subroutine.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.849
How long has this been going on?

24:12.918 --> 24:14.476
About two or three days.

24:14.553 --> 24:16.418
Since Danara came aboard.

24:16.488 --> 24:18.353
What's your point?

24:18.423 --> 24:20.789
Maybe she's the reason
you're feeling this way.

24:20.859 --> 24:22.918
I fail to see a connection.

24:22.994 --> 24:25.462
Maybe you're attracted to her.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.394
I told you,
my program's malfunctioning.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.527
Romance is not a malfunction.

24:31.603 --> 24:33.366
Romance is not part
of my programming.

24:33.438 --> 24:35.565
Your programming's adaptive,
isn't it?

24:35.640 --> 24:36.664
Yes.

24:36.741 --> 24:38.402
Then I'd say it's adapting.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.775
What if...

24:43.381 --> 24:46.214
I don't want it
to adapt right now?

24:46.284 --> 24:47.876
Why wouldn't you?

24:47.953 --> 24:50.683
Because I don't like
what's happening to me.

24:55.694 --> 25:00.097
I'm used to being in control
of my faculties...

25:00.165 --> 25:03.498
confident of my decisions.

25:03.568 --> 25:05.695
But lately...

25:05.770 --> 25:07.795
whenever Danara's program
is deactivated

25:07.873 --> 25:09.932
and I should be
concentrating on my work...

25:11.610 --> 25:14.408
I find myself thinking
of nothing but her.

25:14.479 --> 25:16.572
Why don't you reactivate her?

25:16.648 --> 25:20.106
Because whenever I do that,
I suddenly feel...

25:20.185 --> 25:25.521
unsettled... unsure of myself,
and I have no idea what to say.

25:27.893 --> 25:30.259
Why would people
seek out situations

25:30.328 --> 25:32.694
which induce
such unpleasant symptoms?

25:32.764 --> 25:35.028
Because when the other person
feels the same way you do,

25:35.100 --> 25:37.295
it's the most wonderful
thing in life.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.431
Suppose...

25:43.508 --> 25:44.475
hypothetically

25:44.543 --> 25:45.532
of course...

25:45.610 --> 25:46.975
Of course.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.911
I wanted to pursue
that possibility.

25:52.984 --> 25:54.212
How would I proceed?

25:54.286 --> 25:56.049
You'd have to tell her
how you feel.

25:57.355 --> 25:58.982
That's it?

25:59.090 --> 26:01.581
Just... tell her how I feel?

26:01.693 --> 26:04.491
Otherwise, you may never know
how she feels.

26:11.169 --> 26:13.865
I'm going to try stimulating
your motor neurons.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.908
Well, the nucleus cuneatus

26:17.008 --> 26:19.067
appears to be functioning
normally.

26:19.144 --> 26:24.138
And now for the anterior
thalamic pathway.

26:25.717 --> 26:27.548
Excellent.

26:27.619 --> 26:30.144
By the way, Danara,
I've been meaning to tell you...

26:30.221 --> 26:31.153
Yes?

26:31.222 --> 26:32.587
I'm romantically attracted
to you

26:32.657 --> 26:34.591
and wanted to know
if you felt the same way.

26:39.564 --> 26:41.156
Is something wrong?

26:41.232 --> 26:43.996
No. I...

26:45.470 --> 26:47.734
Did you understand what I said?

26:47.806 --> 26:49.831
Yes.

26:49.908 --> 26:51.671
Well?

26:51.743 --> 26:54.268
Doctor, maybe now
isn't the time to...

26:54.346 --> 26:56.780
Excuse me, Kes.
I was speaking to Danara.

27:00.518 --> 27:05.751
I think it's best if we keep our
relationship... professional.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.164
Well...

27:17.869 --> 27:20.736
I'm going to...

27:20.805 --> 27:25.003
try stimulating
the posterior sciatic nerve.

27:35.754 --> 27:37.915
Doc, what brings you here?

27:37.989 --> 27:39.923
Is somebody sick?

27:39.991 --> 27:41.925
Actually, Mr. Paris,
I was looking for you.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.585
Oh.

27:43.662 --> 27:45.323
Well, pull up a chair.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.887
Mr. Paris,

27:46.965 --> 27:48.592
I assume you've had a
great deal of experience

27:48.667 --> 27:50.157
being rejected by women.

27:50.235 --> 27:51.862
Oh, thanks a lot, Doc.

27:51.936 --> 27:53.870
What I'd like to know is:

27:53.938 --> 27:55.496
What does one do to recover

27:55.573 --> 27:58.599
from the unpleasant symptoms
of romantic rejection?

27:58.677 --> 28:01.077
Why the sudden interest
in romance?

28:01.179 --> 28:02.168
I can't tell you.

28:02.213 --> 28:05.842
It's a matter of doctor/
patient confidentiality.

28:05.917 --> 28:08.181
Ah.

28:08.253 --> 28:10.483
All right, well, let's see.

28:13.725 --> 28:15.818
Sometimes there's
not a lot you can do

28:15.894 --> 28:18.362
to get over a woman
you really care about.

28:20.965 --> 28:23.866
I remember when Susie Crabtree
dumped me

28:23.935 --> 28:27.063
back in my first year
at the Academy.

28:27.138 --> 28:29.106
I broke out in hives.

28:29.174 --> 28:30.539
Couldn't get out of bed
for a week.

28:30.608 --> 28:32.906
I almost failed
Stellar Cartography.

28:33.011 --> 28:36.708
I walked around in a daze
for the rest of that year.

28:36.781 --> 28:42.845
Of course, the first one is
always the hardest to get over.

28:44.823 --> 28:46.723
I see.

28:46.791 --> 28:49.760
But... eventually,

28:49.828 --> 28:52.626
you start thinking
about her less and less,

28:52.697 --> 28:55.860
until finally,
without realizing it,

28:55.934 --> 28:57.663
she's not on your mind anymore.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.705
So the symptoms do subside
over time?

29:02.040 --> 29:03.701
For the most part.

29:03.775 --> 29:09.213
But every now and then,
even years later,

29:09.280 --> 29:10.838
something reminds you of her...

29:10.949 --> 29:15.147
a certain smell,
a few notes of a song...

29:15.220 --> 29:16.187
and suddenly you feel

29:16.254 --> 29:17.846
just as bad as the day
she told you

29:17.922 --> 29:19.583
she never wanted
to see you again.

29:20.692 --> 29:23.456
If you want to know
the honest truth, Doc,

29:23.528 --> 29:26.520
you never completely get over
a woman you really cared about.

29:29.968 --> 29:31.230
Wait a minute.

29:31.302 --> 29:34.760
Doc, we're not talking
about you, are we?

29:36.007 --> 29:38.339
I told you, it was confidential.

29:38.409 --> 29:41.867
Oh, boy, you've got it bad.

29:41.980 --> 29:44.915
Look, Doc, I don't
mean to intrude,

29:45.016 --> 29:47.712
but if you tell me what's
going on, maybe I can help.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.927
Hello, Kes.

30:05.003 --> 30:06.994
Are you feeling all right?

30:08.540 --> 30:09.905
I'm fine.

30:09.974 --> 30:13.171
I'm just... waiting
for the Doctor.

30:13.244 --> 30:14.541
Oh.

30:14.612 --> 30:15.943
He's been gone a long time.

30:19.551 --> 30:21.576
You really like him, don't you?

30:24.122 --> 30:26.386
Then... why didn't you tell him

30:26.457 --> 30:27.822
that you felt the same way

30:27.892 --> 30:30.360
when he told you that he
was attracted to you?

30:30.428 --> 30:32.453
I don't know.
It all happened so fast.

30:32.530 --> 30:33.792
He just blurted it out.

30:33.865 --> 30:36.299
He's very blunt.

30:36.367 --> 30:37.800
You shouldn't
take it personally.

30:37.869 --> 30:38.995
How could he possibly have

30:39.103 --> 30:41.435
those kinds
of feelings about me?

30:41.506 --> 30:44.168
Maybe because
you're a compassionate person,

30:44.242 --> 30:46.142
a brilliant doctor,

30:46.211 --> 30:47.542
you appreciate his humor...

30:47.612 --> 30:48.943
Should I go on?

30:49.013 --> 30:50.810
Please don't.

30:50.882 --> 30:53.043
One thing
you're not very good at

30:53.151 --> 30:55.051
is accepting a compliment.

30:55.119 --> 30:57.917
The next time someone has
something nice to say about you

30:57.989 --> 31:00.549
maybe you should just
take them at their word

31:00.625 --> 31:01.819
and feel good about yourself.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.689
It's not easy to feel
good about yourself

31:05.763 --> 31:08.425
when you're used to living
your life... like that.

31:08.499 --> 31:11.696
Danara, I can't pretend to know
what your life's been like,

31:11.769 --> 31:13.396
but I do know
there's nothing sadder

31:13.471 --> 31:15.405
than a missed opportunity.

31:17.008 --> 31:18.976
Maybe what you
and the Doctor need

31:19.077 --> 31:21.545
is to spend some time
together... alone.

31:25.083 --> 31:27.210
It sounds to me
like she might just be shy.

31:27.285 --> 31:29.719
I think you scared her off.

31:29.787 --> 31:31.015
I did?

31:32.423 --> 31:34.448
Your approach is all wrong.

31:35.860 --> 31:37.851
Well, what would be
the right approach?

31:37.929 --> 31:40.420
Women like romance.

31:40.498 --> 31:42.159
They want men
to make an effort...

31:42.233 --> 31:43.723
take them someplace special.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.533
Where would I take her?

31:50.008 --> 31:51.703
Come with me, Doc.

31:51.776 --> 31:53.107
I've got an idea.

31:59.017 --> 32:04.250
Doctor's Personal Log,
Stardate 49504.3.

32:04.355 --> 32:06.414
Inaugural entry.

32:06.457 --> 32:08.448
Kes and Mr. Paris have conspired

32:08.526 --> 32:10.118
to get Danara and me
alone together

32:10.194 --> 32:12.685
in a place
Paris considers romantic.

32:12.764 --> 32:16.325
I've never felt more... uneasy.

32:30.014 --> 32:31.982
I wasn't sure you were coming.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.517
Neither was I.

32:33.584 --> 32:34.642
If you don't want to be here...

32:34.719 --> 32:35.811
No.

32:35.887 --> 32:37.013
I do.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.585
Where are we exactly?

32:42.660 --> 32:44.753
On a planet called Mars.

32:44.829 --> 32:46.990
Inside a primitive
land-based vehicle.

32:47.065 --> 32:48.930
It's called a '57 Chevy.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.332
Mr. Paris is quite
an automobile aficionado.

32:51.402 --> 32:53.131
This is his program.

32:56.174 --> 32:58.039
What is it that we're
supposed to be doing?

33:00.478 --> 33:04.107
I believe it's called...
parking.

33:07.318 --> 33:09.309
I almost forgot.

33:10.588 --> 33:12.146
These are for you.

33:12.223 --> 33:14.817
Thank you.

33:14.892 --> 33:17.952
You're... you're
very... very thoughtful.

33:26.070 --> 33:28.538
My prayer...

33:29.741 --> 33:32.209
I downloaded
a new dancing subroutine

33:32.276 --> 33:33.504
into my program this morning.

33:33.578 --> 33:35.307
Would you like
to get out and try it?

33:35.380 --> 33:37.314
Actually...

33:37.382 --> 33:41.978
I wouldn't mind just...
sitting here for a while.

33:42.053 --> 33:43.350
You wouldn't?

33:45.356 --> 33:47.153
Those moons and star formations

33:47.225 --> 33:50.353
are so different from anything
I've ever seen before.

33:50.428 --> 33:52.919
Well, if you're interested,

33:52.997 --> 33:55.693
I could point out a few
astronomical highlights.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.337
You see that bluish planet
there...

34:00.438 --> 34:02.702
that's called "Earth."

34:02.740 --> 34:04.640
It's where Starfleet
Headquarters is located.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.473
With the world far away...

34:07.545 --> 34:11.208
And over... there
that's "Cygnus."

34:11.282 --> 34:12.715
And there...

34:12.784 --> 34:15.014
that constellation
is called "Hercules,"

34:15.085 --> 34:17.418
named after a character
in ancient Greek myth.

34:17.487 --> 34:18.853
Hippocrates was also a Greek.

34:18.922 --> 34:20.014
He was the father of...

34:20.091 --> 34:22.184
Tonight...

34:22.260 --> 34:23.920
Earth medicine.

34:23.995 --> 34:27.396
While our heart are aglow...

34:27.465 --> 34:29.364
And that cluster over there...

34:29.434 --> 34:32.733
that's... called the "Pleiades."

34:32.804 --> 34:43.203
Oh, tell me the words
that I'm longing to know

34:45.550 --> 34:50.510
My prayer

34:50.588 --> 34:55.616
And the answer you give

34:58.329 --> 35:02.390
May they still be the same

35:05.069 --> 35:11.030
For as long as we live

35:11.109 --> 35:15.808
That you'll always be there...

35:23.621 --> 35:25.350
Sorry I'm late.

35:25.423 --> 35:26.822
That's all right, Mr. Paris.

35:26.891 --> 35:27.823
We don't need you.

35:27.892 --> 35:30.793
Mr. Grimes has taken
your place at conn.

35:32.163 --> 35:33.630
But it's my shift.

35:33.698 --> 35:35.632
Not today it isn't.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.828
What, because I was
ten minutes late?

35:38.903 --> 35:40.427
That's right.

35:42.340 --> 35:43.307
Captain...

35:43.374 --> 35:44.466
Don't look at me, Mr. Paris.

35:44.542 --> 35:47.534
Commander Chakotay has complete
discretion in this matter.

35:52.550 --> 35:55.815
So, when should I
report back for duty?

35:55.887 --> 35:59.550
When you decide to start
taking your job seriously,

35:59.624 --> 36:00.818
we'll discuss it.

36:00.925 --> 36:02.256
But right now, you're dismissed.

36:02.293 --> 36:04.523
Get your hands off me!

36:10.067 --> 36:11.500
Mr. Tuvok.

36:11.569 --> 36:12.866
Yes, Captain.

36:12.970 --> 36:16.235
Please escort Mr. Paris
to the brig.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.925
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you.

36:39.997 --> 36:42.227
I wasn't even sure if they were
giving you my messages.

36:42.300 --> 36:43.699
I've gotten them all, Mike.

36:43.768 --> 36:45.235
You've been very helpful.

36:46.637 --> 36:50.038
Do you know
what they're asking me to do?

36:50.107 --> 36:51.665
You mean about the warp coils?

36:51.742 --> 36:53.437
I was thinking you could do it

36:53.511 --> 36:56.844
by forcing the magnetic
constrictors out of alignment.

36:56.914 --> 36:58.973
Look, Seska, I don't mind
feeding you information,

36:59.050 --> 37:01.280
but if you're planning
some kind of attack...

37:01.385 --> 37:05.344
I have no intention of raising
my child on a Kazon ship!

37:05.389 --> 37:07.721
One way or another,
I'm going to take Voyager.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.657
You can either help me
or you can suffer

37:09.727 --> 37:11.422
along with Janeway
and the others.

37:13.864 --> 37:16.355
Don't worry, Mike.

37:16.434 --> 37:18.766
Everything's been planned
to the letter.

37:18.836 --> 37:21.327
Here's how it's going to work.

37:21.405 --> 37:26.433
We'll be waiting for you
on a planet called Hemikek IV.

37:28.045 --> 37:32.311
Doctor's Personal Log,
Stardate 49507.2.

37:32.383 --> 37:34.476
The more time I spend
with Danara,

37:34.552 --> 37:37.214
the more my programming
continues to adapt.

37:37.288 --> 37:39.654
I look forward to perfecting
my romantic skills

37:39.724 --> 37:42.284
once we've completed
the synaptic transfer.

37:42.360 --> 37:45.022
Set the delta band frequency
of the holo-emitter

37:45.096 --> 37:46.028
to seven terahertz.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.530
Seven terahertz.

37:50.735 --> 37:52.498
Wait a minute.

37:52.570 --> 37:55.801
Did you administer the cervaline
as I instructed?

37:55.873 --> 37:58.239
500 milligrams every four hours.

37:58.309 --> 37:59.776
I don't understand it.

37:59.844 --> 38:00.833
What's wrong?

38:00.945 --> 38:05.109
The brain... your brain...
it's rejecting the graft.

38:05.149 --> 38:07.709
We can't go through
with the transfer.

38:14.792 --> 38:17.386
I'm detecting elevated
levels of nytoxinol.

38:17.461 --> 38:18.689
Where could that have come from?

38:18.763 --> 38:20.253
Is it possible
you made an error?

38:20.331 --> 38:22.322
Administered nytoxinol
instead of cervaline?

38:22.400 --> 38:25.335
No, I don't think so.

38:25.403 --> 38:27.166
But here's the hypospray I used.

38:27.238 --> 38:28.603
Check for yourself.

38:28.673 --> 38:30.868
You're correct.
It's cervaline.

38:30.941 --> 38:32.306
Has anyone else been in Sick Bay

38:32.376 --> 38:34.571
during the last 24 hours
other than you and Danara?

38:34.645 --> 38:36.442
Crewman Foster came in
for some analgesic

38:36.514 --> 38:38.106
and Ensign Wildman was here

38:38.182 --> 38:40.412
for her regular prenatal visit.
Why?

38:40.484 --> 38:41.416
Because, if the nytoxinol

38:41.485 --> 38:42.713
was not administered
by accident,

38:42.787 --> 38:43.811
I can only conclude

38:43.888 --> 38:45.822
that someone is deliberately
trying to kill Danara.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.755
Who would want to kill her?

38:47.825 --> 38:49.520
Perhaps someone who bears
ill will toward Vidiians.

38:49.593 --> 38:50.787
Whoever it is,
I intend to find out.

38:50.861 --> 38:51.793
I'm calling Lieutenant Tuvok.

38:51.862 --> 38:53.625
Please don't do that.

38:53.698 --> 38:54.630
We have to find out

38:54.699 --> 38:56.667
who's trying
to obstruct your recovery.

38:56.734 --> 38:59.259
I administered the nytoxinol.

39:01.706 --> 39:03.105
Didn't you know
it would kill you?

39:03.174 --> 39:04.801
You mean kill her.

39:04.909 --> 39:05.841
She is you.

39:05.943 --> 39:06.841
Was me.

39:06.911 --> 39:08.879
I don't ever want
to be her again.

39:14.385 --> 39:16.376
What are you doing?

39:16.454 --> 39:17.819
Looking for the cervaline.

39:17.888 --> 39:19.856
I have to reduce the rate
of tissue rejection

39:19.957 --> 39:20.981
before it's too late.

39:21.058 --> 39:22.855
Kes, would you excuse us?

39:29.166 --> 39:30.861
I don't want to go through
with the transfer.

39:30.935 --> 39:32.402
If we don't get
your neural patterns

39:32.470 --> 39:33.459
out of the holo-buffer,

39:33.537 --> 39:35.164
you'll be brain dead
in a matter of days.

39:35.239 --> 39:36.706
I can't let that happen.

39:36.774 --> 39:39.572
I'd rather live two more
days like this with you

39:39.643 --> 39:40.871
than go on
for who knows how long,

39:40.978 --> 39:42.172
wasting away a piece at a time.

39:42.246 --> 39:44.373
It's my duty to keep you alive.

39:44.448 --> 39:45.813
I thought you were
more than my doctor.

39:45.883 --> 39:46.815
I thought you were my friend.

39:46.884 --> 39:48.351
I am your friend.

39:48.419 --> 39:51.911
What kind of friend would ask me
to go on living like this?

39:51.989 --> 39:53.149
And for what?

39:53.224 --> 39:54.714
So that I can go back to a world

39:54.792 --> 39:56.521
where everyone I ever loved
has died,

39:56.594 --> 39:59.188
where almost everyone I meet
is going to die?

39:59.263 --> 40:00.195
You're a doctor.

40:00.264 --> 40:01.196
You can help them.

40:01.265 --> 40:02.357
I can't help them.

40:02.433 --> 40:03.457
I can't cure them.

40:03.534 --> 40:06.526
All I can do
is prolong their suffering...

40:06.604 --> 40:09.698
just like you want
to do to me now.

40:09.774 --> 40:11.901
Danara...

40:14.445 --> 40:16.470
I have no desire
to see you suffer.

40:16.547 --> 40:19.311
Do you know what it's like?
Do you?

40:19.383 --> 40:20.315
No, but...

40:20.384 --> 40:21.817
What it's like to be
a nine-year-old child

40:21.886 --> 40:23.183
and suddenly your best friend

40:23.254 --> 40:25.188
doesn't want to come
to your house anymore.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.986
And when you ask
your mother why...

40:28.058 --> 40:30.891
"Why won't Mala come
and play with me anymore?"

40:30.961 --> 40:32.929
And she tells you
it's because...

40:34.698 --> 40:38.634
it's because the other children
are afraid of you.

40:47.478 --> 40:48.945
Listen to me.

40:49.013 --> 40:52.779
Before I met you,
I was just a disease.

40:52.850 --> 40:55.683
But now, everything's different.

40:55.753 --> 40:57.050
When people look at me,

40:57.121 --> 40:59.089
they don't see a disease
anymore.

41:01.926 --> 41:04.190
They see a woman,

41:04.261 --> 41:06.491
a woman you made,

41:06.564 --> 41:08.259
a woman you love,

41:08.332 --> 41:10.630
a woman you're not
afraid to touch.

41:10.701 --> 41:14.137
Danara, I was never
afraid to touch you.

41:14.205 --> 41:16.605
Why? Because you're a doctor?

41:16.674 --> 41:18.767
Because I love you.

41:18.843 --> 41:20.936
You say that now,

41:21.078 --> 41:24.070
but if I go through
with the transfer...

41:24.148 --> 41:26.514
If you go through
with the transfer...?

41:26.584 --> 41:28.950
I will be sick again...

41:29.019 --> 41:30.486
and ugly.

41:30.554 --> 41:32.647
Danara, you're not ugly.
You're simply ill.

41:33.691 --> 41:37.286
Please, stop patronizing me!

41:39.230 --> 41:41.790
I know how people see me.

41:41.866 --> 41:44.835
Danara, do you think
if you go back

41:44.902 --> 41:47.370
into your own body,
I'll feel different about you?

41:47.438 --> 41:48.405
Won't you?

41:48.472 --> 41:49.530
Listen to me.

41:49.607 --> 41:52.440
Nothing could ever change
the way I feel about you...

41:52.510 --> 41:55.877
not a few scars,
not some diseased skin, nothing.

41:55.946 --> 41:58.744
You have given me
the most extraordinary gift

41:58.816 --> 42:00.215
that anyone has ever given me.

42:00.317 --> 42:01.909
You brought me to this ship

42:01.952 --> 42:04.648
where no one is sick,
and people are friendly.

42:04.722 --> 42:08.385
You've made me
healthy and beautiful.

42:08.459 --> 42:12.088
I don't want to go back
to the way things were.

42:13.731 --> 42:18.759
You said, before you knew me,
that you were just a disease.

42:18.836 --> 42:21.930
Well, before you, I was just
a projection of photons

42:22.006 --> 42:24.167
held together by force fields,

42:24.241 --> 42:27.210
a computerized physician
doing a job,

42:27.278 --> 42:28.768
doing it exceptionally well,
of course,

42:28.846 --> 42:33.613
but still, it was... just
a profession, not a life.

42:33.684 --> 42:38.246
But now that you're here,
and my programming has adapted,

42:38.322 --> 42:40.415
I'm not just working anymore.

42:40.491 --> 42:43.153
I'm living,
learning what it means...

42:43.227 --> 42:45.525
to be with someone,
to love someone.

42:45.596 --> 42:50.363
I don't think I can go back
to the way things were either.

42:52.736 --> 42:56.172
Danara, please...

42:56.240 --> 42:58.731
don't die.

42:58.809 --> 43:01.710
I want us to be together.

43:01.812 --> 43:04.246
So do I.

43:06.584 --> 43:09.246
But if you put me back
into that body,

43:09.320 --> 43:13.780
I'll have to go home...
and help my people.

43:13.857 --> 43:15.222
I know.

43:15.292 --> 43:18.284
But we'd still have
two weeks together

43:18.362 --> 43:21.229
before we reached your colony.

43:24.134 --> 43:30.095
Danara, please, be with me
for as long as you can.

44:32.202 --> 44:37.868
Computer, play music program
Doctor-alpha.
