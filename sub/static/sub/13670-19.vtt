WEBVTT

00:01.320 --> 00:03.920
What are you doing with my son?
Where are you going?

00:03.920 --> 00:06.360
What do I have to do
to get my little boy back?

00:06.360 --> 00:09.200
We have to be Barbara's parents,
 at least for now.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.000
It's the biggest responsibility
 in the world.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
You're a smart-ass. Use your brain
for something beside chasing skirts.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
             Oh, Nina!

00:21.080 --> 00:25.080
            Hi, buddy.

01:54.680 --> 01:56.960
That right kidney
is definitely smaller.

01:56.960 --> 01:57.400
Why?

01:57.400 --> 01:59.880
Why?
Could be a significant
vascular lesion.

01:59.880 --> 02:02.640
 I better schedule him for angio.

02:02.640 --> 02:06.160
No, I meant, why are you sending
 Elliot and me to California?

02:06.160 --> 02:08.880
A conference on
primary care techniques.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.440
Oliver was supposed to go,
but he cancelled.

02:11.440 --> 02:14.080
Something about his plane
being on the fritz,

02:14.080 --> 02:15.120
     he won't fly commercial.

02:15.120 --> 02:16.400
     he won't fly commercial.
Beverly Royale Hotel.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.880
Barton was supposed to go
but he can't leave,

02:18.880 --> 02:20.520
   he's passing a kidney stone.

02:20.520 --> 02:23.520
Olympic-sized pool!

02:23.520 --> 02:25.720
I know 36 hours isn't much notice...

02:25.720 --> 02:26.840
No, I'm your guy!

02:26.840 --> 02:30.760
It's important that St Eligius
keeps up with new care techniques.

02:30.760 --> 02:34.640
I'm expecting a full written report
from you when you get back.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.000
Sure.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
Dr Westphall? I know you and I
  have had our troubles lately.

02:40.120 --> 02:43.280
I want to thank you
   for the vote of confidence.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.400
Oh, we pulled your names
out of a hat.

02:45.400 --> 02:49.120
Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry I'm late.
I got involved in a consult.

02:49.120 --> 02:52.960
Susie Larkham down at County has
your plane tickets and per diems.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.680
OK!

02:54.680 --> 02:55.720
            Oh, Elliot?

02:55.720 --> 02:56.440
Yes, sir?

02:56.440 --> 03:00.080
Yes, sir?
This is Bond Steven's phone number.
He was my room-mate in med school.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.680
First in the class,
and one hell of a poker player.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.320
 Give him this package, will you?

03:04.320 --> 03:05.520
 Give him this package, will you?
Will do.

03:05.520 --> 03:06.800
         Have a safe trip.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.840
We'll try. Thank you very much, sir.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.400
Where are we going?

03:10.400 --> 03:12.160
Paradise!

03:12.160 --> 03:16.160
SAW BUZZES

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
Don't worry, Pete.
I'm not hurting your dad.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.520
Any word on Pete's kidnappers yet?

03:24.520 --> 03:28.520
No. Police found Pete near the
common, they just left him there.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.240
Paediatrician says Pete's fine.

03:31.240 --> 03:32.880
No evidence of molestation.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.320
   That's good. OK, here we go.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.600
Let me just try pulling this apart.
Hold on.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.280
      Oh, stinks, doesn't it?

03:41.280 --> 03:43.480
        OK, nice and easy.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.560
          Nice and easy.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.280
Ahhh...

03:47.280 --> 03:50.280
Ahhh...
You're gonna need to start
physical therapy right away.

03:50.280 --> 03:51.720
Whoa!

03:51.720 --> 03:54.000
               Lilacs are in bloom...

03:54.000 --> 03:56.840
 second year residency's almost over.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.200
Third year's safely off
in the distance.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.960
    Assuming we don't get cut!

04:00.960 --> 04:03.760
What do you mean? Everyone continues
into third year.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.040
    Checked the bulletin board?

04:06.040 --> 04:09.520
Internal medicine and surgery
are dropping three people each.

04:09.520 --> 04:12.040
What? Oh, man...

04:12.040 --> 04:15.520
I only made it this far because
Wendy died at the end of first year

04:15.520 --> 04:16.839
and her place opened up.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.000
What am I gonna do if I get cut?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.280
               (SIGHS) Marry wealth?

04:22.280 --> 04:24.640
Great(!)

04:24.640 --> 04:26.280
Where's Pete?

04:26.280 --> 04:29.080
Pete?
              Pete?!

04:29.080 --> 04:30.600
Where is he?

04:30.600 --> 04:34.600
Pete?

04:34.920 --> 04:38.920
Hit the urinal today, my whizz was
the colour of the Charles River.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.680
   I'm tired, I feel like hell.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.400
Knee hurt too?

04:42.400 --> 04:45.680
         Only when I walk.

04:45.680 --> 04:49.280
Cheap shot D-back clipped me,
in the 75 game.

04:49.280 --> 04:51.240
Yeah.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.000
What do you do for a living?

04:53.000 --> 04:56.920
Football. I'm an offensive guard, had
a try-out with the Patriots today.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.960
You look a little jaundiced.
   Any exposure to hepatitis?

04:59.960 --> 05:01.320
      Not that I know of, no.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.760
Fever, any pain?  No.

05:02.760 --> 05:06.280
Use any injectable drugs?

05:06.280 --> 05:09.760
Double shot of cortisone
before the games, uh...

05:09.760 --> 05:12.760
maybe a little crank now and then,
but Doc, I ain't no doper.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.520
Nobody said you were.
   If you're with the Patriots,

05:15.520 --> 05:18.120
how come they didn't send you
  to the team doctor?

05:18.120 --> 05:21.280
I didn't say I was with them,
I said I was trying out with them.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.080
Teams have a tendency to let me go,

05:23.080 --> 05:26.760
I spend the off-season trying to
hook up with a new one.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.400
You know, if word got out I was sick,
I'd be NFL history.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.440
That's why I came to this dump,
heard it's low profile.

05:33.440 --> 05:36.280
Any lower, we'd be mining coal.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.360
Never played football.

05:37.360 --> 05:41.360
Never played football.
       You're kidding me(?)

05:50.360 --> 05:51.880
Hi!

05:51.880 --> 05:55.880
Now, who do you belong to, huh?

05:56.800 --> 05:58.160
               Hey!

05:58.160 --> 06:00.160
     Hey! Leave my son alone.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.840
No problem.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.160
Don't you ever do that again,
understand me?

06:04.160 --> 06:05.520
       Do you understand me?

06:05.520 --> 06:07.640
COMPUTER BEEPS

06:07.640 --> 06:09.040
Come on!

06:09.040 --> 06:10.520
Trouble?

06:10.520 --> 06:13.000
I can't get the admissions list.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.760
Uh... Hit the return key hard,
  twice, quickly.

06:15.760 --> 06:19.040
Used to stick.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.800
Huh! Thanks.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.120
Sure.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.080
Any doughnuts?

06:24.080 --> 06:28.080
No, we must be out.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.200
Ah! Always hid a few.

06:30.200 --> 06:33.840
(LAUGHS) You seem to
      know your way around!

06:33.840 --> 06:36.600
I used to work here years ago.

06:36.600 --> 06:40.600
PAGER BEEPS

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
CRYING

07:08.320 --> 07:12.320
TELEVISION IS ON

07:13.840 --> 07:15.040
             Grace...

07:15.040 --> 07:17.120
     What the hell's going on?

07:17.120 --> 07:21.120
Well, they say that solar power is
the way of the future.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.640
But they say it's gonna rain.

07:23.640 --> 07:27.080
He was wearing a dress so I'm not
sure if he was kidding.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.240
I could hear the baby crying all the
way from the shower.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.960
              Shhh...

07:31.960 --> 07:35.040
Good to let him cry, brings the
 phlegm up out of the pores.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.920
Raised all my boys that way.

07:36.920 --> 07:40.920
Isn't it nice that you can visit them
all in the same place every
third Sunday.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.240
Where's the coffee?

07:43.240 --> 07:47.240
I didn't make any today. It didn't
seem worth the grind.

07:47.280 --> 07:49.560
  Helen, this is all your fault.

07:49.560 --> 07:52.080
I asked you to hire from the
employment agency

07:52.080 --> 07:55.240
       not the parole board!

07:55.240 --> 07:56.400
Morning, Grace.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.840
She can't cook, she doesn't do the
dusting.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.000
She neglects the baby.
Enough is enough.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
If you're terminating my service,
I'm entitled to two weeks'
severance pay.

08:06.240 --> 08:10.000
When I tell my son how I've
   been treated...

08:10.000 --> 08:11.480
      What the roads, Grace.

08:11.480 --> 08:12.440
          They're slick.

08:12.440 --> 08:13.440
          They're slick.
Now what do I do?

08:13.440 --> 08:15.960
Every nanny I've hired you fire.

08:15.960 --> 08:19.240
 We'll have to fend for ourselves.

08:19.240 --> 08:22.120
  Don't forget to get my shirts.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.160
And be sure you check them this time.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.240
 The man's abacus is a bead short.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.680
  I'm gonna be late for surgery.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.000
I'll see you later.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.440
My support group meets today. Maybe
we could have some lunch?

08:32.440 --> 08:34.080
      Yeah, well, we'll see.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.120
Kiss goodbye?

08:35.120 --> 08:39.120
             Right...

08:44.760 --> 08:48.200
We shouldn't have cashed in our
business class tickets for coach.

08:48.200 --> 08:52.160
You're right. There's less room, but
there's more spending money for
Universal tours

08:52.160 --> 08:54.760
and dinner after Carson and
a rental car.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.000
This conference schedule
looks hectic.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
Patient approach to the
lifthanopothy. The ins and outs of
treritis ani.

09:01.680 --> 09:05.520
Maybe we should save it and
Disneyland for tomorrow and head to
the beach.

09:05.520 --> 09:06.920
              This looks interesting.

09:06.920 --> 09:10.080
              Flexible Sigmundoscopy.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.480
Would you like to trade seats?

09:11.480 --> 09:15.440
I prefer the aisle. Going to LA - we
should check out the scene.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.720
      Rome - there's a city.

09:17.720 --> 09:21.720
    I bet Paris is a fun town.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.800
How long will I have to stay here?

09:24.800 --> 09:28.800
We gotta take some X-rays and get
some tests. Could be a day.
Maybe two.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.960
Just so his arm doesn't bother him
for the championships.

09:31.960 --> 09:35.720
Yeah, plus Dad hates doing
my paper route.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.600
Neighbours' dogs don't like me.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.920
Championships in what?

09:38.920 --> 09:42.000
            Basketball.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.480
   I wish I was as tall as you.

09:44.480 --> 09:48.480
In football I play quarterback, in
baseball, catcher and basketball,
thrower.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.800
Our son's quite an athlete.
(LAUGHS)

09:51.800 --> 09:53.680
          Chicago Bears!

09:53.680 --> 09:55.960
    Gary Fencik's my favourite.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.000
He rang my bell a few times.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.720
           You know him?

09:59.720 --> 10:00.880
Played against him.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.240
       Are you John Spinola?

10:02.240 --> 10:04.520
No, I'm John Corzinsky.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.480
Heard of me?

10:06.480 --> 10:07.520
                No.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.520
I didn't think so.

10:10.520 --> 10:14.520
Wow! Did you see
the size of his arm?

10:15.080 --> 10:18.320
I understand you're sending two
 residents to California.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.640
I'd love to see the old stomping
ground. Consider me one
 step forward.

10:21.640 --> 10:22.960
         You're too late.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.200
Let's get on with this next patient.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.160
White male, 56, 420lbs,

10:28.160 --> 10:31.840
condition consistent with
    pilon arthritis,

10:31.840 --> 10:34.280
placed on antibiotics pending result
of urine.

10:34.280 --> 10:37.480
 What's the antibiotic of choice?

10:37.480 --> 10:39.040
             Anybody?

10:39.040 --> 10:41.400
First episode without
      underlying disease

10:41.400 --> 10:45.400
a broad spectrum penicillin
   is indicated.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.760
Who's the eager beaver?

10:48.760 --> 10:52.760
Some med student.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.360
          How you doing?

10:55.360 --> 10:57.040
Everybody's bothering me.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.600
I'm tired... and my back hurts.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.120
Can I see the chart, please?

11:02.120 --> 11:06.120
We'd like to see that fever drop and
we're gonna run a few more tests.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.080
        Just relax for now.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.880
You're taking vitals every four
hours and giving meds every three -

11:11.880 --> 11:14.360
that's only two hours between
  eruptions.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.880
No wonder he's edgy.

11:17.880 --> 11:21.880
Dr Chandler, let's change the
schedule give him more time to rest.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.120
You have a nice day, OK.

11:25.120 --> 11:28.160
Try anyway.

11:28.160 --> 11:31.440
Here, thanks.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.640
Who the hell is she?

11:32.640 --> 11:36.640
            You got me!

11:36.880 --> 11:40.320
Is it three hours ahead or behind? I
can never remember.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.800
Depends where you started.

11:41.800 --> 11:42.960
            I guess so.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.160
Oh!

11:44.160 --> 11:45.200
              Wayne!

11:45.200 --> 11:47.320
Need a barf bag?

11:47.320 --> 11:48.640
                No!

11:48.640 --> 11:50.480
       Irregular heartbeat.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.600
Stewardess...

11:51.600 --> 11:53.640
Get oxygen, we're doctors.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.200
Yes.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.760
Nitro-glycerine. What about those
masks that drop down?

11:59.760 --> 12:00.920
Those are for emergencies.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.920
Those are for emergencies.
What the hell do you call this?

12:07.840 --> 12:10.800
'Ladies and gentlemen, this is the
captain...'

12:10.800 --> 12:12.760
Just breathe.

12:12.760 --> 12:16.760
# BEACH BOYS:
        California Girls

12:49.640 --> 12:52.520
The well equipped examination room,
an overview.

12:52.520 --> 12:56.520
To the patient, your examination room
can be a supportive,
healing environment

12:57.280 --> 12:59.640
or a chamber of horrors...
Let's cruise.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.840
Are you kidding me? We can't just
      get up and walk out.

13:02.840 --> 13:05.880
Besides, Westphall wants us
to write a report when we get back.

13:05.880 --> 13:09.600
What's the worst that can happen? We
write a bad report, we get yelled at

13:09.600 --> 13:12.160
and the next time Westphall
      sends somebody else.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.560
Meanwhile, we're missing peak
         tanning hours.

13:14.560 --> 13:18.560
 ..Let's begin  by looking at some
anxiety-producing instruments that
should be kept out of sight

13:19.040 --> 13:21.120
in your exam room. Lights, please.

13:21.120 --> 13:24.360
Look, this is only the first
      lecture, no big deal.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.600
Come back in an hour
        for the next one.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.720
No, no!

13:29.720 --> 13:33.160
     ..The vaginal speculum...

13:33.160 --> 13:37.160
The anus scope and rubber gloves...

13:41.040 --> 13:43.080
Hi, Jack. What can I do for you?

13:43.080 --> 13:45.440
I got a patient,
   a 10-year-old, into sports.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.960
Phil Chambers has got another
   patient, a football player.

13:47.960 --> 13:51.600
I wanted permission
to move Tim out of Paediatrics
     and put them together.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.600
   Check it out with Phil?  Yeah.
   Sports is this kid's life.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.960
I thought he'd like a room
with a pro athlete.  OK, fine.  Good.

13:57.960 --> 14:00.160
       How you doing, Pete?

14:00.160 --> 14:02.840
I thought you'd have him back
in day care by now.

14:02.840 --> 14:04.640
I don't want him out of my sight.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.840
Look, Jack, we all have kids
and we're all protective of them.

14:07.840 --> 14:11.840
After what's happened to you,
I can understand your concern,
but you can't drag little Pete

14:12.280 --> 14:16.280
into all the patients' rooms.
I can't go through that again.
Oh, it'll be OK.

14:20.280 --> 14:24.280
Novino... have you heard
   of the trickle-down theory?

14:25.120 --> 14:26.640
               Yes.

14:26.640 --> 14:30.640
Then you can waste your time
rearranging that fat man's
          med schedule.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.040
But he's not my patient!  He is now.

14:33.040 --> 14:37.040
I'm the doctor, you're the medical
student. You made more work for me
so I'm making more work for you.

14:37.680 --> 14:41.680
Trickle-down. I'm also going to be
looking over your shoulder
     on the Corzinsky case.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.360
That lab report should be ready.
          Pick them up.

14:44.360 --> 14:48.360
I can't get to the lab right...  Now.
..now.

14:49.800 --> 14:53.120
BABY CRIES
Carrie, what's been going on
with you?

14:53.120 --> 14:55.960
My son Rocky passed away
          a month ago.

14:55.960 --> 14:59.960
You told us that last week.
Now, let's try and move a little
further here, shall we?

15:05.360 --> 15:07.400
Of leukaemia.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.920
            That's it?

15:09.920 --> 15:13.920
Anybody else?

15:14.280 --> 15:18.280
Well, glad we released all that pain
in an open supportive atmosphere(!)

15:18.480 --> 15:21.200
I don't think your sarcasm's
    going to help very much.

15:21.200 --> 15:25.200
My God, we've been meeting for weeks
and you four act like this
is a bridge tournament.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.840
If I'd lost a child,
I'd be screaming my lungs out,
like that one in your arms.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.280
I'd be in such agony,
I'd want the world to know!

15:33.280 --> 15:34.880
I do my crying alone.

15:34.880 --> 15:38.800
Why? Don't you think
anybody else cares?

15:38.800 --> 15:41.320
I know people care. It's just...

15:41.320 --> 15:42.360
            Just what?

15:42.360 --> 15:46.360
Just easier to sit there quietly
and let the hurt eat you up inside?

15:47.360 --> 15:50.880
Can't you make that baby shut up?!

15:50.880 --> 15:54.880
Excuse me. I'm sorry, Dr Weiss,
   I'm sorry, I'll just, uh...

15:56.360 --> 15:58.520
take her out in the hall.

15:58.520 --> 16:02.520
BABY CONTINUES CRYING

16:06.040 --> 16:10.000
Gabby, hi. Carol Novino.
..Yeah, back again.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.520
Med student this time,
serving my clerkship.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.600
Listen, could you do something
for me?

16:14.600 --> 16:17.120
Could you get the Kazinsky labs
to Third for me?

16:17.120 --> 16:21.120
I know I'm supposed to pick them up
but if you could hand them to an
orderly, that would be really great.

16:21.880 --> 16:25.360
     Thanks, Gabby. ..OK, bye.

16:25.360 --> 16:29.360
I know a few tricks Chandler doesn't!

16:30.080 --> 16:32.120
What are those?

16:32.120 --> 16:36.120
Ankle weights. The only exercise
I can get, keeps the thighs
under control.

16:36.280 --> 16:39.800
You know I meant to keep in touch
with you after you left...  Me too.

16:39.800 --> 16:43.800
I was just so busy.  Now I realise
how much I missed you. The laughs
        we used to have!

16:44.480 --> 16:47.640
Did Mrs Liskas
     get her trace back yet?

16:47.640 --> 16:51.280
No, not yet...  My fault.
Haven't picked them up yet.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.000
We need the film soon.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.680
Sorry, I didn't meet you last night.
 I'm Jackie Wade. Carol Novino.

16:56.680 --> 17:00.680
Carol was floor nurse here
for seven years before she
   skipped off to med school.

17:00.840 --> 17:03.640
That explains
 calling Dr Westphall "Donald"!

17:03.640 --> 17:07.640
Habit. We're old friends. In fact,
he's the one who encouraged me
to become a doctor.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.880
Medicine's so challenging. I don't
know why I didn't do it before

17:10.880 --> 17:13.800
but there was no support for ambition
when I was growing up.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.280
Women became nurses or mums. So I was
steered wrong, that's all.

17:17.280 --> 17:19.599
I'm both - where does that leave me?

17:19.599 --> 17:21.760
   Oh, nursing wasn't bad but...

17:21.760 --> 17:25.760
It's boring. You take a ton
of grief, nobody recognises
        your true value,

17:26.599 --> 17:30.600
but it beats being a med student
            any day.

17:31.200 --> 17:35.200
Well, I'm busy. I have work to do.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.560
  The defence is in a three-four

17:37.560 --> 17:40.120
and the quarterbacks on the outside.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.960
Should they run to the opposite side?

17:42.960 --> 17:45.720
It depends.

17:45.720 --> 17:48.480
             On what?

17:48.480 --> 17:50.360
Lots of things.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.600
Want another magazine?
I got Sporting News.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.240
Ah!  Are you here
cos you got hurt playing?

17:57.240 --> 18:01.240
No.  Me neither. I've never been
hurt. They don't know what's wrong
with my arm.

18:03.200 --> 18:06.360
It's about time. Finally found out
          the problem?

18:06.360 --> 18:10.360
Come on, up on the bed.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.040
Well, you don't have hepatitis.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.400
Phew! So when do I go home?

18:15.400 --> 18:19.360
A liver function abnormality such as
yours suggests a few possibilities.

18:19.360 --> 18:23.360
Hepapabiliar disease such as
biliar sclerosis, colodethiasis...

18:24.080 --> 18:26.880
or the toxic effect of some drug.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.640
I'm clean.

18:28.640 --> 18:32.640
Mr Kazinsky, one cause of liver
trouble, especially in athletes,

18:33.920 --> 18:37.440
can be the use of anabolic steroids.

18:37.440 --> 18:41.440
I, um, took the liberty
     of ordering some tests.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.520
Must be taking a lot.

18:43.520 --> 18:47.080
You ever try track working
      a 250lb line backer?

18:47.080 --> 18:48.920
Need every ounce I can get.

18:48.920 --> 18:52.920
The increase in body weight results
from salt and water retention
       caused by the drug.

18:53.240 --> 18:57.240
I'll take the pounds any way they
     come.  On top of it all,
 you could be killing yourself.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.400
You're running the risk of tumours
       and liver failure.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.400
Just leave me alone.  Mr Kazinsky,
       please...  Spike it.

19:18.320 --> 19:22.320
        I'm terribly sorry.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.000
Mark...

19:28.000 --> 19:30.480
Not now, I'm on my way to a consult.

19:30.480 --> 19:32.720
Well, I don't care!

19:32.720 --> 19:36.040
For crying out loud,
the baby's crying out loud!

19:36.040 --> 19:37.800
    Can't you quieten her down?

19:37.800 --> 19:41.800
Here - you do it!

19:45.800 --> 19:48.840
What's the matter, little girl? Huh?

19:48.840 --> 19:51.560
"Cutie pie"!

19:51.560 --> 19:55.560
Wayne, we've been stuck in traffic
for an hour and a half!

19:56.400 --> 20:00.400
We've already missed the seminar
on eructation barborigmi inflatus.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.120
My Z-car. I love
these licence plates!

20:05.120 --> 20:09.120
Look, it's Carey Grant in a
beat up Studebaker... I guess not.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.960
       What's that one say?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.120
No-und-r-where?

20:13.120 --> 20:14.840
           No underwear!

20:14.840 --> 20:17.760
Somebody paid good money
   to put that on their bumper?

20:17.760 --> 20:19.080
     I think it's kinda neat.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.320
We better head back.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.600
What's next on the 'copter schedule?

20:22.600 --> 20:26.320
Proper use of third generation
  cephalus sporins

20:26.320 --> 20:28.080
given by a Dr Geobel of Mayo's.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.480
          Hold the mayo.

20:29.480 --> 20:30.560
Let's hit Venice.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.720
          But, Wayne...!

20:31.720 --> 20:33.520
We'll copy the lecture reprint.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.840
Gee, the girl in the Mustang
smiled at me!

20:35.840 --> 20:36.640
Eliot...

20:36.640 --> 20:38.200
Eliot...
       She threw me a kiss!

20:38.200 --> 20:39.120
It's not a girl.

20:39.120 --> 20:43.120
It's not a girl.
 Oh, my God! Wasn't that our exit?

20:43.680 --> 20:46.320
This little piggy went to market...

20:46.320 --> 20:48.520
What do you mean you won't tell me?

20:48.520 --> 20:50.320
&lt; ..This little piggy stayed home.

20:50.320 --> 20:51.960
I have a patient upstairs in pain.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.080
She's got gas, she'll survive.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.920
&lt; ..This little piggy had none!

20:55.920 --> 20:58.200
That's disgusting. Would you get
your feet off the table?

20:58.200 --> 20:59.720
&lt; This is the doctor's lounge.

20:59.720 --> 21:01.760
That is disgusting.
                Get 'em off, please.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.800
I've had a long day
and it's only half over.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.560
Will you tell me the possible
side-effects of Dilantin?

21:06.560 --> 21:09.160
Look, if you don't have the time,
   I don't have the time,

21:09.160 --> 21:11.920
Doris Day doesn't have the time and
 I don't have any to waste

21:11.920 --> 21:14.360
on spoon-feeding you.
      Check it out in the text book.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.680
Another thing, next time you decide
to lecture one of my patients

21:17.680 --> 21:21.680
on the evils of steroids,
give me a call first, OK?

21:24.280 --> 21:27.920
Why are you all treating me
     so rotten? Because...because...

21:27.920 --> 21:30.480
I'm older than you? Cos I used
      to be a nurse? Do I smell?!

21:30.480 --> 21:32.960
Rotten treatment is a time-honoured
medical tradition.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.720
This is a way empty-headed med
students

21:34.720 --> 21:36.160
become free-thinking doctors.

21:36.160 --> 21:37.400
You believe that?

21:37.400 --> 21:39.960
Only because I'm on this side
of the barb wire.

21:39.960 --> 21:43.960
(TUTS)

21:44.840 --> 21:47.320
Carol, I've been looking all over...

21:47.320 --> 21:49.560
What?! Want me to dress a wound?
    Start an IV?

21:49.560 --> 21:51.320
I know! Take your urine to the lab?

21:51.320 --> 21:53.520
I know my face is lowest
            on the totem pole.

21:53.520 --> 21:56.480
I'll do anything you command
        but I don't have to like it!

21:56.480 --> 22:00.480
I was going to ask you to lunch.

22:00.960 --> 22:04.960
Jacqui, would you look at this?

22:06.320 --> 22:09.800
      Arm. Kid's. Hi, cutie.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.320
That's it?

22:11.320 --> 22:14.320
Last x-ray I read for you
was your knee film.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.320
         You didn't trust my opinion.

22:16.320 --> 22:17.680
I was nervous.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.600
              You were a total yo-yo.

22:19.600 --> 22:23.600
My husband does the same. He thinks
I overreact in most situations.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

22:25.880 --> 22:29.880
Would you look at the X-ray?

22:30.200 --> 22:33.840
He's an active boy with unexplained
pain in the right arm.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.080
      I don't see a fracture.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.360
Right here. Lesion.

22:37.360 --> 22:40.200
   Could be a cyst. Or a tumour.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.520
I ordered a biopsy.

22:41.520 --> 22:45.360
   Then what did you ask me for?

22:45.360 --> 22:46.720
Corroboration.

22:46.720 --> 22:50.720
Half of you makes a decision,
the other half second guesses.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.960
                Trust your instincts.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.600
Right. Right.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.760
But you agree to the biopsy?

22:57.760 --> 23:01.480
               Yes!

23:01.480 --> 23:03.040
 How old did you say the boy was?

23:03.040 --> 23:04.120
Ten.

23:04.120 --> 23:08.120
Here I am, criticising you
and this kid may lose his arm.

23:23.840 --> 23:26.800
The trick is to try to keep your
centre of gravity low...

23:26.800 --> 23:30.800
This low enough for you?

23:32.120 --> 23:34.800
Why don't we try to skate
to the pier and back?

23:34.800 --> 23:35.480
Please...!

23:35.480 --> 23:38.760
Please...!
Come on, push with your back foot
and steer with your lead.

23:38.760 --> 23:39.880
                         I said push.

23:39.880 --> 23:40.560
I am pushing...

23:40.560 --> 23:41.640
I am pushing...
             No, push!

23:41.640 --> 23:45.640
Push and steer, push...

23:48.040 --> 23:49.200
                     You're hopeless.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.200
I only wanna practice medicine.
I was never meant to be on wheels.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.560
     Did you call Westphall's friend?

23:55.560 --> 23:56.680
No, I forgot.

23:56.680 --> 24:00.680
      I'll do it. Give me the number.

24:01.840 --> 24:05.840
&lt; You know, we've missed
four lectures already.

24:06.920 --> 24:10.040
Eliot, you're a lousy person
to travel with.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.720
     I need another 20 cents.

24:11.720 --> 24:14.440
&lt; You know, I like having fun.

24:14.440 --> 24:18.440
&lt; I just feel bad about
missing the conference.

24:24.800 --> 24:25.920
I'm sorry, sir.

24:25.920 --> 24:29.400
That will never, ever happen again.

24:29.400 --> 24:32.880
The stiffer you are,
the easier you BREAK!

24:32.880 --> 24:36.560
Dr Stevens? This is Wayne Fiscus
from St Eligius hospital in Boston.

24:36.560 --> 24:40.560
Dr Westphall asked me to call
when I got to town.

24:40.800 --> 24:44.800
Eliot?

24:58.240 --> 24:59.720
What a party!

24:59.720 --> 25:03.720
Party over here!

25:07.840 --> 25:10.360
Want me to take a look at that?
I'm a doctor.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.160
                            Whoa, OK!

25:12.160 --> 25:13.720
                               Eliot!

25:13.720 --> 25:17.720
                            Let's go.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.000
What are those?

25:26.000 --> 25:29.440
                    Discharge papers.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.000
That's just great(!)

25:31.000 --> 25:33.720
You tell me I'm dying,
then point me to the door?

25:33.720 --> 25:34.600
Come on, fix me up.

25:34.600 --> 25:36.560
Nothing I can do.
Stop taking steroids.

25:36.560 --> 25:37.920
Quit playing football.

25:37.920 --> 25:40.120
The drug's only giving you
a psychological boost.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.480
              It's all state of mind.

25:41.480 --> 25:44.000
Listen, I'm two steps slow
and 20 pounds light.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.680
I got one move that everybody
in three leagues knows.

25:46.680 --> 25:49.560
I get away with just enough
to play the game most Sundays.

25:49.560 --> 25:53.160
Usually from the bench
and never on the same team.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.920
For me, state of mind
is more important than my body.

25:55.920 --> 25:59.800
Elementary school, felt great
to put on a field hockey uniform

25:59.800 --> 26:03.800
for the first time and smack all the
other Catholic girls in the shins.

26:04.520 --> 26:07.160
Of course, then I heard
you had to practise,

26:07.160 --> 26:10.200
   and so I said, "Forget that."

26:10.200 --> 26:14.200
    But the feeling never left.

26:14.360 --> 26:16.720
I ain't gonna be that.

26:16.720 --> 26:19.840
That dream got sacked a long time
    ago, along with the fun.

26:19.840 --> 26:23.840
Then why are you still playing?
You know what I majored in
         in college?  No.

26:24.680 --> 26:28.680
Administrative science. Tell me
what that is and we'll both know.

26:31.200 --> 26:34.160
It was on a football scholarship.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.320
Lived in a football dorm.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.600
Ate at a football table.

26:38.600 --> 26:42.600
Football, football, football.

26:43.800 --> 26:47.200
Now I hate the damn game.

26:47.200 --> 26:50.160
But I got nothing else.
Don't know how to do nothing else.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.920
No options.

26:51.920 --> 26:55.920
Live or die...

26:56.200 --> 27:00.200
It seems like you're sacrificing
a lot to avoid making a change.

27:03.280 --> 27:07.280
Just trying to make a pension, lady.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.120
           Donald, Mark?

27:26.120 --> 27:27.320
Hi.  Ah, Novino!

27:27.320 --> 27:31.320
Fine job this morning.
Thanks.  Your first day,
you almost kill a patient.  What?

27:32.320 --> 27:36.320
She had abdominal pain.
She has an aortic aneurysm.
   Under the knife right now.

27:36.480 --> 27:40.480
Resident-in-charge says you never
got the X-rays read.
I was on my way...

27:40.480 --> 27:44.480
That aneurysm could have
ruptured and killed the woman.
Somebody else caught it in time.

27:46.560 --> 27:50.560
    I'm sorry.  Can the apology.
Abdominal stress should be treated
        as an emergency.

27:51.320 --> 27:53.520
You know, any nurse
       can diagnose pain.

27:53.520 --> 27:57.520
You wanna play doctor, you wanna
start assuming the responsibility
 of making decisions. Got that?

27:59.040 --> 28:03.040
             Yes, sir.

28:04.200 --> 28:07.360
You know, Mark always respected your
      nursing capabilities.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.840
Sometimes, it's difficult to change
  the image people have of us.

28:10.840 --> 28:14.840
I need a pep talk, do you have
a minute?  No, I'm on my way
   to a meeting. Maybe later?

28:15.480 --> 28:19.480
           Yeah, thanks.

28:31.480 --> 28:34.480
You know, you're right,
Venice was kind of fun.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.240
LA kind of grows on you, you know?
Like mould!

28:37.240 --> 28:41.080
I was cornered by some wacko selling
pot holders made out of real human
              hair.

28:41.080 --> 28:44.320
He tried to convince me Charles
 Manson is a political prisoner.

28:44.320 --> 28:45.360
               Look!

28:45.360 --> 28:47.400
      Is that Lucille Ball?!

28:47.400 --> 28:50.040
I don't think Lucy works for UPS.

28:50.040 --> 28:54.040
                Oh.

28:54.840 --> 28:58.840
DOORBELL RINGS

29:05.080 --> 29:09.080
Hi, boys...  I'm Wayne Fiscus,
         Elliot Axelrod.

29:10.120 --> 29:13.360
Hi, nice to meet you.  How do you do?
   How's the conference going?

29:13.360 --> 29:17.360
Oh, it's, er, informative, it's very
interesting.  Nice.  Skipped it, huh?

29:18.040 --> 29:20.200
Don and I did that in New York once.

29:20.200 --> 29:24.200
Hit every Bebop club from Birdland
to Jimmy's, investigated what the
       bands were smoking.

29:24.840 --> 29:27.120
Take a swim, if you want.
         PH is perfect.

29:27.120 --> 29:30.320
Oh, no, thanks. Dr Westphall sent
  this for you.  Oh, thank you.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.560
Let's take a seat.

29:31.560 --> 29:35.560
Some iced tea and sangria
         for our guests.

29:36.880 --> 29:38.160
How long you in town?

29:38.160 --> 29:42.160
We're catching the red-eye out
 tomorrow.  Yeah, we really hate
to leave.  I know what you mean.

29:43.760 --> 29:47.760
I changed trains here in LA.
       A wind was blowing,

29:50.240 --> 29:53.480
there was snow on the mountains...

29:53.480 --> 29:57.480
..a clean, well-lighted place,
          I never left.

30:02.280 --> 30:05.480
(HE LAUGHS)

30:05.480 --> 30:09.480
How is Don?  Well, he left for a few
months, he did some refugee work
in Ethiopia.

30:10.200 --> 30:14.080
He's back now. He's trying to start
 a community outreach programme.

30:14.080 --> 30:18.080
He wants to get a family clinic off
 the ground.  Taking himself too
           seriously!

30:18.640 --> 30:22.640
Dr Westphall's taught us the
importance of getting involved
      in community service.

30:22.880 --> 30:26.880
Nothing wrong with trying to change
the world. But you have to start
      by changing yourself.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.000
Being a doctor...was almost the most
important thing in the world to Don.

30:34.360 --> 30:38.360
Even more important than his family.
I've always thought there was more
            to life.

30:38.760 --> 30:40.880
Trying my hand at a book, here.

30:40.880 --> 30:43.440
It's probably lousy,
       it doesn't matter.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.240
  So, you're an oncologist, huh?

30:46.240 --> 30:49.960
Three days a week.
TELEPHONE RINGS

30:49.960 --> 30:52.760
Yes?

30:52.760 --> 30:55.040
..15 minutes. Bye.

30:55.040 --> 30:57.680
Gotta hit the office.
We'll let you get dressed.

30:57.680 --> 31:01.680
Already am. Enjoy.
   And give my best to Donald.

31:11.880 --> 31:14.960
Morrison?  Yep.

31:14.960 --> 31:18.720
There are two people sitting in my
office, enquiring about their son.

31:18.720 --> 31:20.960
CHILD CRIES
 Parents?  That's all right, baby.

31:20.960 --> 31:24.960
I don't know what they're talking
about.  Tim Perry, 10, I sent you
   a file.  What the hell for?

31:25.280 --> 31:29.280
The parents have to be told their
son has bone cancer in his arm.
So tell them!  I thought it'd help

31:30.280 --> 31:34.280
if the Chief of Surgery...  Morrison,
the boy is your patient.
       Now, get in there.

31:35.840 --> 31:39.840
I thought I'd arrange to have Tim
  started on radiation.  Proven
   treatment of choice here...

31:41.320 --> 31:45.120
is amputation.  There've been new
    advances in chemotherapy.

31:45.120 --> 31:49.120
Look, what's this about?
Are you afraid of being
   upfront with these people?

31:49.200 --> 31:53.200
Sir, I can't help imagining what it
would be like getting this news
             myself.

31:53.320 --> 31:56.080
How I felt when I was in danger of
        losing this guy.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.760
Doctors lose every day, Morrison.

31:58.760 --> 32:02.480
Sometimes they get lucky
    and win too. Accept that.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.960
The best thing that you can offer
    these people is comfort.

32:05.960 --> 32:09.960
It's always been your long suit
        anyway. Come on.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.840
Ellen...hi.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.560
Is Mark joining you?

32:18.560 --> 32:20.560
              Er, no.

32:20.560 --> 32:24.560
Have a seat.  Thanks.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.480
How's Barbara?

32:26.480 --> 32:29.480
Vocal.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.280
After living with Mark,
   you should be used to that.

32:32.280 --> 32:36.280
        Maybe I'm too old.

32:36.520 --> 32:39.760
    And Mark is no help at all.

32:39.760 --> 32:41.960
He really pitched in at first, but...

32:41.960 --> 32:45.280
now, he's just like he was
when Stephen was young.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.800
He's only there for the coochy-coos.

32:47.800 --> 32:51.800
Well, I think the concept of quality
   time eluded our generation.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.600
       The baby's teething.

32:53.600 --> 32:57.600
Crying all the time.

32:58.240 --> 33:02.240
                       What do I do?

33:02.320 --> 33:06.320
  I shove her at Mark and walk away.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.160
               What's wrong with me?

33:08.160 --> 33:09.720
Ellen, the baby needs you.

33:09.720 --> 33:13.480
If Mark isn't going to help, you're
going to have to raise her yourself.

33:13.480 --> 33:17.480
       The problem is not with Mark.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.200
You know, Mark blames himself
for what happened to Stephen

33:23.200 --> 33:26.080
         because he was never there.

33:26.080 --> 33:30.080
But when I look back
on who actually raised Stephen...

33:30.120 --> 33:34.120
          I was the one responsible.

33:35.120 --> 33:39.120
 I guess maybe I was a lousy mother.

33:43.080 --> 33:46.760
            You want me to tell him?

33:46.760 --> 33:50.760
I'd like to try myself.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.840
Hi, Pete.

34:00.840 --> 34:02.920
Are you OK, Mom?

34:02.920 --> 34:06.320
My arm doesn't really hurt
that bad now.

34:06.320 --> 34:10.239
Tim...we met with the doctors.

34:10.239 --> 34:14.239
You know how out in the back yard
  the elm had gotten diseased.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.239
One branch had a bad spot

34:17.239 --> 34:19.679
and...

34:19.679 --> 34:22.320
the tree surgeon...

34:22.320 --> 34:23.679
he, um...

34:23.679 --> 34:26.400
I'll be all right
for the game, won't I?

34:26.400 --> 34:30.400
Tim, you've got a disease
in the bone of your arm.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.280
Wow, the werewolf!

34:41.280 --> 34:45.280
Lemme get a picture of you two.

34:46.400 --> 34:47.440
That guy really gave me the creeps.

34:47.440 --> 34:49.840
That guy really gave me the creeps.
Me too... Palms!

34:49.840 --> 34:51.920
                     No, Dr Stevens.

34:51.920 --> 34:55.080
Westphall said he was one of
the heavy hitters in med school.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.720
What's he got to show for it -
a suntan and a novel.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.640
You don't look a day over 40.

34:59.640 --> 35:02.320
Perfect body, happy.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.920
So what if he's not
             medical establishment.

35:04.920 --> 35:05.960
Neither are you.

35:05.960 --> 35:09.480
Neither are you.
Medicine should be more than just
a hobby. Westphall's committed.

35:09.480 --> 35:11.800
Which is more
than we can say for us.

35:11.800 --> 35:14.840
What are we gonna do, lie about
attending the conference?

35:14.840 --> 35:17.360
Don't worry, relax.
          We'll think of something.

35:17.360 --> 35:20.000
He's gonna know as soon as
he reads our reports.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.840
We should have been
more conscientious,
shown some professional pride.

35:23.840 --> 35:27.440
Mart Todd must not've been too hot
in the kitchen! He's thin as a rail.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.920
I bet I'd drop a few pounds
if I move to LA.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.960
Why would losing weight here
be any easier than in Boston?

35:32.960 --> 35:35.840
Back home, everybody
thinks of me as a fat person.

35:35.840 --> 35:37.840
My friends, my family...

35:37.840 --> 35:39.480
I'll always be the same to you.

35:39.480 --> 35:42.560
But nobody has a history
in La La Land. Like Dr Stevens.

35:42.560 --> 35:46.560
You can come out here
      and reinvent your whole life.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.120
Or lose yourself.

35:48.120 --> 35:51.240
Where else could somebody charge
   seven and half bucks a head

35:51.240 --> 35:53.960
to stare at a wax dummy
            of Muammar Gadaffi?

35:53.960 --> 35:57.960
That's Bert Convey.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.920
Wow!

36:04.920 --> 36:06.520
Elvis is so life-like!

36:06.520 --> 36:08.960
Even his hips are shaking.
RUMBLING

36:08.960 --> 36:10.000
What's happening?

36:10.000 --> 36:13.400
        It's an earthquake.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.160
Look out for Dolly Parton!

36:14.160 --> 36:15.320
Look out for Dolly Parton!
Ah!

36:15.320 --> 36:19.320
MUZAK PLAYS

36:28.240 --> 36:29.760
Look, kid, er...

36:29.760 --> 36:31.760
 I played with this deaf guy once.

36:31.760 --> 36:35.600
Quarterback gave him hand signals,
no problem.

36:35.600 --> 36:38.880
I guess I can't play
       with a deaf guy.

36:38.880 --> 36:42.280
              Yeah...

36:42.280 --> 36:46.280
    Listen, you hang in there.

36:47.320 --> 36:50.280
You shouldn't take drugs to play.
It's stupid.

36:50.280 --> 36:52.120
       I got no choice, kid.

36:52.120 --> 36:56.120
Sure.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.880
I've been carting this kid around
all day...

37:15.880 --> 37:17.360
except during surgery,

37:17.360 --> 37:19.840
when I was forced to give her
to some dimwit in accounting.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.960
when I was forced to give her
to some dimwit in accounting.
   Hello! Did you miss your grandma?

37:21.960 --> 37:24.240
You have a lot of explaining
to do, Ellen.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.360
To me and Barbara.

37:25.360 --> 37:27.600
To me and Barbara.
Mark, I just needed some time alone.

37:27.600 --> 37:31.600
Maybe that chowderhead Morrison
enjoys mucking out
his kid's diapers all day,

37:33.240 --> 37:35.440
but I've got
more important things to do.

37:35.440 --> 37:38.160
Mark, you've got to take
some responsibility here.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.680
I bring home the bacon.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.640
Speaking of which...

37:42.640 --> 37:43.400
..what are we having?

37:43.400 --> 37:44.520
..what are we having?
Pot roast.

37:44.520 --> 37:45.960
Right...

37:45.960 --> 37:49.560
Looks dry.

37:49.560 --> 37:53.040
Mark, I'm up half the night with
Barbara while you're fast asleep.

37:53.040 --> 37:56.680
Honey, I perform surgery every day -
I need my rest.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.480
I can't handle Barbara alone.

37:58.480 --> 38:02.480
We're not getting another nanny
without extensive interviews,

38:03.040 --> 38:04.600
character references,

38:04.600 --> 38:06.280
maybe a polygraph.

38:06.280 --> 38:07.680
By the way,

38:07.680 --> 38:09.240
Barbara needs a bath.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.280
(SNIFFS)

38:10.280 --> 38:14.280
So do I.

38:30.640 --> 38:34.080
I've never noticed how old and so
close together the buildings are.

38:34.080 --> 38:38.080
At least the ground's not gonna
open up and swallow us.

38:40.280 --> 38:43.800
We're not due back till the day
 after tomorrow. What'll we do?

38:43.800 --> 38:45.560
      Sleep off the jet lag?

38:45.560 --> 38:47.000
What are you two doing back
from the west?

38:47.000 --> 38:50.360
What are you two doing back
from the west?
The conference was cancelled.
The earthquake damaged out hotel.

38:50.360 --> 38:53.600
What did you do
while the fun lasted?

38:53.600 --> 38:54.880
                     He really lied.

38:54.880 --> 38:56.360
You're talking about my homeland.

38:56.360 --> 38:57.640
You're talking about my homeland.
It's a great place.

38:57.640 --> 38:59.000
Warm, mellow...

38:59.000 --> 39:01.600
                    Moronic, stupid.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.760
What kind of car were you driving?

39:03.760 --> 39:05.440
I miss LA already.

39:05.440 --> 39:06.640
                             Not me.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.600
             I love the dirty water.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.040
             Boston, you're my home.

39:10.040 --> 39:13.280
The west coast has the sunshine
and the girls all get so tanned!

39:13.280 --> 39:16.960
I got off the plane expecting
American Dream and Technicolor.

39:16.960 --> 39:20.000
It's just another city -
big, dirty, impersonal.

39:20.000 --> 39:24.000
The only difference is
palm trees instead of maple.

39:24.000 --> 39:28.000
See you around.
Did you get my message?

39:28.400 --> 39:32.280
One bean and beef burrito to go.
                       Extra cheese.

39:32.280 --> 39:36.280
Fabulous. Ohhhh.

39:49.200 --> 39:52.800
Hi.
Pete and I want to say good night.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.640
When they operate, will it hurt?

39:55.640 --> 39:56.800
No.

39:56.800 --> 39:58.840
         You'll be asleep.

39:58.840 --> 40:02.520
Kids have to do
    what everyone tells them!

40:02.520 --> 40:03.520
            I'm sorry.

40:03.520 --> 40:07.520
            I'm sorry.
I'm the one who'll be playing
  in the special Olympics!

40:09.360 --> 40:13.360
I know what it's like to lose
part of you.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.760
                         Not my arm.

40:16.760 --> 40:20.160
I'm scared.
Yeah, I'll bet.

40:20.160 --> 40:23.000
    Well, I'm scared too, sometimes.

40:23.000 --> 40:27.000
I get scared of losing people
that I care about,

40:27.920 --> 40:30.840
        of trusting myself.

40:30.840 --> 40:34.840
   Like you might feel before a game.

40:35.200 --> 40:39.200
   There's no shame in being afraid.

40:39.280 --> 40:41.440
We just can't let it ruin our lives.

40:41.440 --> 40:45.360
Well, at least I'll still have
 my left one.

40:45.360 --> 40:49.360
                    Yeah.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.440
Hi.
&lt; What are you doing here?

41:06.440 --> 41:10.440
- This is the men's on-call room.
-  It used to be women's.

41:14.200 --> 41:16.640
&lt; You're staying?

41:16.640 --> 41:18.800
I'm too tired to move.

41:18.800 --> 41:21.360
Thought I'd ask.

41:21.360 --> 41:23.920
Had the tortellini, huh?

41:23.920 --> 41:25.960
&lt; Nerves.

41:25.960 --> 41:27.560
You?

41:27.560 --> 41:31.560
Yeah, comes with the job.

41:36.520 --> 41:40.520
You know what I think about the job?

41:40.960 --> 41:44.520
I think this job  stinks!

41:44.520 --> 41:48.440
You residents treat me
      like I'm a water boy.

41:48.440 --> 41:52.440
My nursing buddies think I'm stuck
up. Dr Craig thinks I'm a smart ass.

41:56.280 --> 42:00.280
I worked here for seven years.
  Thought I knew it inside out.

42:01.520 --> 42:05.520
24 hours later, I'm a mess.

42:06.200 --> 42:10.200
Well... At least
you could fool some of the patients.

42:10.560 --> 42:14.560
No, I'm not even good at that.
 You were right about Korzinsky.

42:15.520 --> 42:19.520
I had had no time so I was blunt
and all that did was terrify him.

42:19.560 --> 42:23.480
Westphall wouldn't have sent you
to school if you couldn't do it.

42:23.480 --> 42:27.480
Yeah, maybe.

42:29.200 --> 42:32.240
And this is just the first day.

42:32.240 --> 42:36.240
Yeah, there's still plenty of time
for you to really hate the place.

42:40.800 --> 42:41.960
Jack?

42:41.960 --> 42:45.480
I er... I put Pete back in day care.

42:45.480 --> 42:49.360
Good. I didn't mean to jump down
 your throat today.

42:49.360 --> 42:51.480
            No, you were right.

42:51.480 --> 42:55.480
I understand internal medicine
is limiting acceptance
for third year.

42:56.520 --> 43:00.440
I have no idea who will go.
    No sense worrying about it now.

43:00.440 --> 43:04.320
I'm not.
That's what I wanted to say.

43:04.320 --> 43:08.320
For the past few years, I've kind
of had the sap sucked out of me.

43:09.200 --> 43:13.200
A lot of problems I've brought on
myself. Gave control of my life away.

43:14.240 --> 43:17.280
Not taking responsibility was easier.

43:17.280 --> 43:21.280
Even having control doesn't mean
 we'll make the right decisions.

43:21.720 --> 43:25.720
I told a ten-year-old boy today
we're amputating his arm.

43:27.040 --> 43:31.040
He cried.
But he never felt sorry for himself.

43:31.800 --> 43:35.800
I got this weird side of me -
like I don't deserve to be happy.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.480
             But I do.

43:39.480 --> 43:43.480
And with or without this hospital,
I'll survive.

43:44.840 --> 43:48.840
I know you will - this is the first
time you've come to me without
asking for advice. Good night.

43:55.920 --> 43:58.960
             Hey you!

43:58.960 --> 44:02.960
        We'll survive, huh?

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
BABY CRIES

44:20.200 --> 44:24.200
BABY CRIES MORE LOUDLY

44:29.240 --> 44:33.240
MORE CRYING

44:38.040 --> 44:42.040
It's all right, Barbara.
It's all right.

44:43.920 --> 44:47.920
It's OK, baby. It's just Grandma.
Grammy's here.

44:51.560 --> 44:53.920
              OK, OK.

44:53.920 --> 44:56.240
             Ssssssh.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.600
            Ssssssssh.

44:58.600 --> 45:01.360
            Yes, honey.

45:01.360 --> 45:05.360
It's cold in here, isn't it?
Yes, it's cold.

45:08.120 --> 45:10.880
            Ssssssssh.

45:10.880 --> 45:14.880
It's all right, honey.
It's all right.

45:15.000 --> 45:18.520
          I know, I know.

45:18.520 --> 45:22.520
  (SOBS) What are we going to do?

45:22.920 --> 46:02.000
BABY CRIES
