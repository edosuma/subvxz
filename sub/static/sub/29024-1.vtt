00:18.625 --> 00:21.500
It's like torching
every relationship that's

00:21.583 --> 00:23.292
ever meant a damn to you.

00:26.792 --> 00:33.083
I left that dear, sweet
baby in his dirty diaper.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.750
And after all
that, I still ain't

00:35.833 --> 00:38.083
put that damn bottle down.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.167
<i>This is a safe place.</i>

00:46.333 --> 00:47.583
This is a haven from--

00:47.667 --> 00:48.792
from the world outside.

00:48.875 --> 00:51.625
There's-- there's
no judgment here.

00:58.250 --> 01:04.167
Today is a very, very special
day for him, because today,

01:04.250 --> 01:06.708
he earns his 90 day chip.

01:06.792 --> 01:07.792
Thomas.

01:13.750 --> 01:16.458
My name is Thomas Lewis.

01:16.542 --> 01:18.125
And I'm an alcoholic.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.458
Hi, Thomas.

01:20.792 --> 01:24.125
You know, I can speak to a
classroom full of 200 students,

01:24.208 --> 01:29.750
but every time I come up here,
it's like I'm sweating bullets.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.833
Means 13 months ago, I
was finalizing my divorce.

01:40.917 --> 01:42.250
In a short amount
of time, things

01:42.333 --> 01:46.375
look so different, I feel clear.

01:48.083 --> 01:50.917
<i>I'm grateful my ex-wife is
finally allowing me to see</i>

01:51.000 --> 01:54.333
my daughter unsupervised, which
means I don't have to look over

01:54.417 --> 01:56.167
my shoulder at the social
worker looking at me

01:56.250 --> 01:59.375
like I'm a criminal.

01:59.458 --> 02:02.083
Do you have a bag?

02:02.167 --> 02:03.167
Brittany.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.000
It's my daughter's name.

02:05.083 --> 02:10.917
Things go well, then she gets
to spend the night with me.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.125
Because of you, I'm--

02:13.208 --> 02:16.708
I'm planning on having ice
cream with my daughter.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.625
Dad!

04:54.000 --> 04:55.417
Hey, how you doin'?

04:55.500 --> 04:56.958
- Dad!
- Oh.

04:57.042 --> 04:57.875
Oh, I missed you.

04:57.958 --> 05:00.208
I missed you.

05:00.292 --> 05:02.083
Look at you.

05:02.167 --> 05:03.667
I'm sorry I'm late.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.667
Hey, sweetheart.
Go ahead, go play.

05:05.750 --> 05:06.958
You know what?

05:07.042 --> 05:09.083
I'll let you know
when it's time to go.

05:09.167 --> 05:10.375
Wow.

05:10.458 --> 05:11.458
This kid's got so much energy.

05:11.542 --> 05:12.375
They're hype.

05:12.458 --> 05:13.833
They're making me hyper.

05:13.917 --> 05:15.875
You remember having this
much energy as a kid?

05:15.958 --> 05:18.792
No, I don't know anybody that
has as much energy as she does.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.875
90 day chip.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.917
Just like I promised you.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.958
I'm surprised you went through
with everything this time.

05:30.042 --> 05:31.500
Oh.

05:31.583 --> 05:32.917
Look, I-- mm, I
didn't mean that.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.958
No, no, it's fine. Hey, Brittany.
Let's go. Let's go.

05:37.042 --> 05:38.000
I got a surprise
for you at home.

05:38.083 --> 05:40.042
Bye, guys.
Ooh, a surprise?

05:40.125 --> 05:41.167
Is it a phone?

05:41.250 --> 05:42.250
Well, how are
you gonna find

05:42.333 --> 05:43.875
out unless you get in the car?

05:43.958 --> 05:45.750
Yes.

05:45.833 --> 05:47.833
- Bye, mom.
- Bye.

05:47.917 --> 05:49.167
Have fun, honey.

05:49.250 --> 05:52.583
Um, be sure you have
her in bed by 9:00, okay?

05:52.667 --> 05:54.333
Yeah.

05:54.417 --> 05:55.292
And look, Thomas.

05:55.375 --> 05:56.583
I didn't mean anything.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.208
No, no. Look, it's fine.

05:58.292 --> 05:59.667
Thanks again.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.708
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

07:16.542 --> 07:17.583
Wish me luck.

07:57.583 --> 08:01.125
And where did you say
this high school was again?

08:01.208 --> 08:02.292
Fairbanks, Alaska.

08:02.375 --> 08:03.250
Oh.

08:03.333 --> 08:04.500
My dad was in the military.

08:04.583 --> 08:06.292
Oh, okay.

08:06.375 --> 08:09.583
Because I've just never seen
a transcript like this before.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.250
Is that gonna be a problem?

08:11.333 --> 08:12.167
No, no.

08:12.250 --> 08:13.500
It shouldn't.

08:13.583 --> 08:15.917
Here's your schedule
and map of the campus.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.417
And welcome.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.542
Cool, thanks.

08:19.625 --> 08:20.708
Hey, there.

08:20.792 --> 08:21.958
How can I help you?

08:22.042 --> 08:25.792
My name is, uh,
Professor Thomas Lewis.

08:25.875 --> 08:30.583
For those of you in
the back, that is--

08:32.375 --> 08:38.792
Professor Thomas Lewis.

08:41.750 --> 08:44.167
Now, in, uh, broad
strokes, we will

08:44.250 --> 08:46.625
be covering various
ancient mythologies

08:46.708 --> 08:48.375
from around the world.

08:48.458 --> 08:49.917
But before I get
started, I'd like

08:50.000 --> 08:53.583
to introduce you to my
assistant, your TA, Leslie.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.042
Please stand and tell the class
a little bit about yourself.

08:56.125 --> 08:57.208
Of course.

08:57.292 --> 08:58.125
Hi, everybody.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.583
That's me.

08:59.667 --> 09:01.208
I've known Thomas
for quite a while.

09:01.292 --> 09:03.125
I've taken this course
before, so I have a pretty

09:03.208 --> 09:04.708
good idea at what I'm doing.

09:04.792 --> 09:06.542
If you guys have any
questions, you guys

09:06.625 --> 09:08.792
need help with anything,
please feel free to ask me.

09:08.875 --> 09:09.708
I'm here to help.

09:09.792 --> 09:11.083
Okay?

09:11.167 --> 09:12.417
Now, if you're looking
for her work hours,

09:12.500 --> 09:15.583
they're in the syllabus
right under mine.

09:15.667 --> 09:18.542
Well, speaking of syllabus,
who in here doesn't have one?

09:18.625 --> 09:20.667
Raise your hand.

09:20.750 --> 09:21.625
Would you help me, and, uh--

09:21.708 --> 09:23.125
Yeah, of course.

09:23.208 --> 09:25.750
--with the back, and I'll
take care of the front.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.708
All right, now.

09:52.667 --> 09:54.375
All right.

09:54.458 --> 09:56.333
Now that everybody
has their syllabus,

09:56.417 --> 09:58.375
let's get into this mythology.

09:58.458 --> 10:00.667
All right, isn't it
about a hero's journey?

10:00.750 --> 10:02.167
Let's find this hero's journey.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.250
All right.

10:11.917 --> 10:13.208
You guys need
help with something?

10:13.292 --> 10:15.458
Cool. What's up?

10:15.542 --> 10:16.917
Um, so I don't really
know what this is saying,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.125
um, but I can go ahead
and ask the Professor

10:19.208 --> 10:20.292
if he can help us.

10:20.375 --> 10:21.417
Professor Lewis, can you
come over here and help us

10:21.500 --> 10:22.792
- for a second, please?
- Sure.

10:22.875 --> 10:24.125
Okay.
They need help with this one.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.708
- If you can--
- Okay.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.375
Well, you know what?
Disregard that.

10:27.458 --> 10:28.542
Just go to chapter one.

10:28.625 --> 10:30.167
All right?
Excellent.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.375
You are so smart.

10:31.458 --> 10:32.292
No, no, no.

10:32.375 --> 10:33.208
I appreciate it.

10:33.292 --> 10:34.542
You're the smart one.

10:34.625 --> 10:35.958
I really appreciate--
you know--

10:36.042 --> 10:37.458
I mean, I'm happy to
be back in your class.

10:37.542 --> 10:38.583
Oh, I'm happy to have you.

10:38.667 --> 10:39.792
Yes.

10:39.875 --> 10:41.250
Um, so I'll catch
up with you later?

10:41.333 --> 10:42.792
- Okay.
- All right, cool.

11:08.417 --> 11:09.417
Jerk!

11:13.625 --> 11:14.542
You okay?

11:14.625 --> 11:16.417
Yeah, I'm all right.

11:16.500 --> 11:20.208
In his defense, uh, he
did kind of honk his horn.

11:20.292 --> 11:24.042
I can't hear nothin' with
these on, so maybe he did.

11:24.125 --> 11:25.792
You're in one of my
classes, aren't you?

11:25.875 --> 11:27.125
Yeah.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.208
How are you liking it so far?

11:29.292 --> 11:31.250
I mean, for the
first day it was cool.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.375
It was cool. Okay.
Well, that's good.

11:34.458 --> 11:36.750
I see, uh, you're
job hunting, there.

11:36.833 --> 11:40.042
Yeah. I, uh, need a job.

11:40.125 --> 11:41.917
Well, I don't wanna
impose, but, uh, do you

11:42.000 --> 11:43.583
mind if I make a suggestion?

11:43.667 --> 11:45.333
Go ahead.

11:45.417 --> 11:47.750
Well, a couple of blocks from
here is a diner called Sal's.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.000
I usually go there a couple of
days out the week after class.

11:50.083 --> 11:51.958
Best steak and
eggs I've ever had.

11:52.042 --> 11:53.583
Owner's name is Julio.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.625
Great guy, could
always use some help.

11:55.708 --> 11:57.000
That's, though--
well, of course,

11:57.083 --> 11:58.792
if you don't mind
getting your hands dirty.

11:58.875 --> 12:00.500
No, I don't mind at all.

12:00.583 --> 12:01.875
Good.

12:01.958 --> 12:03.542
Tell him Thomas Lewis sent you.

12:03.625 --> 12:05.292
All right, cool. Thanks.

12:05.375 --> 12:07.000
All right.

12:07.083 --> 12:11.917
And, uh, I think you should
look both ways when you cross.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.083
It's a good thing.

12:13.167 --> 12:14.333
All right.

12:14.417 --> 12:15.417
I'll see you in class.

12:15.500 --> 12:16.500
Yeah.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.208
Hi.

12:26.500 --> 12:27.500
Hi.

12:27.792 --> 12:29.125
Hi.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.958
That's me, Leslie.

12:34.333 --> 12:37.167
I already took this class.

12:37.250 --> 12:41.500
So I already know everything.

12:41.583 --> 12:45.000
And I know it all.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.958
And I already know Professor Lewis.

12:48.708 --> 12:49.708
Hmm.

13:07.792 --> 13:09.708
I'll get the ones in the back.

13:17.333 --> 13:19.583
Frequent theme
in all mythologies

13:19.667 --> 13:25.417
is the correlation
between love and loss.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.583
Heart-wrenching
passion and death.

13:36.125 --> 13:37.208
Hello, Miss Jacobs.

13:37.292 --> 13:38.583
Please, have a seat.

13:38.667 --> 13:39.667
Sorry.

13:44.417 --> 13:46.500
Your hair looks
nice, by the way.

13:46.583 --> 13:48.542
Thank you.

13:48.625 --> 13:53.167
Love and death is a constant
trope used in all mythologies.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.042
A character is allowed
to find their one

13:55.125 --> 13:56.833
true love, allowed
to be with them

13:56.917 --> 13:59.500
for a certain period of time.

13:59.583 --> 14:02.667
Then, for one reason or
another, tragedy strikes.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.667
And the two are torn apart.

14:05.750 --> 14:09.625
If you look at the Greek
story allegory of Orpheus and

14:09.708 --> 14:12.750
Eurydices, or Isis and Osiris.

14:12.833 --> 14:16.583
Or even in the modern biblical
parable of Sodom and Gomorrah.

14:16.667 --> 14:19.792
In it, Lot had worked,
tirelessly, to save the city.

14:19.875 --> 14:25.000
But even in the end, it
is his own wife that is

14:25.083 --> 14:27.583
turned into a pillar of salt.

14:29.542 --> 14:31.500
Hey. Professor Lewis?

14:31.583 --> 14:32.417
Hey.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.167
Hey, Tracy.
What can I do for you?

14:34.250 --> 14:35.667
I just wanted to
say thanks again.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.583
Besides saving my
life last week,

14:37.667 --> 14:39.375
you recommending Sal's
was a good thing.

14:39.458 --> 14:40.292
I got the job.

14:40.375 --> 14:41.375
I started yesterday.

14:41.458 --> 14:42.292
Good.

14:42.375 --> 14:43.750
Congratulations.

14:43.833 --> 14:44.667
Thank you.

14:44.750 --> 14:45.917
Guess I'm gonna
have to go down there

14:46.000 --> 14:47.667
and order a steak
and eggs special.

14:47.750 --> 14:49.750
Oh my god, I would love that.

14:49.833 --> 14:51.250
I usually work Wednesday night--

14:51.333 --> 14:52.458
Hey, Tom, I had a few
questions about the papers

14:52.542 --> 14:55.500
that I was given yester--

14:55.583 --> 14:56.833
Oh, I am so sorry.

14:56.917 --> 14:58.125
I didn't realize you guys were--

14:58.208 --> 14:59.083
I apologize.

14:59.167 --> 15:00.000
I didn't mean to interrupt.

15:00.083 --> 15:01.583
Oh, go ahead and finish.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.167
No, it's-- it's cool.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.792
We're-- we were finished.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.417
Well, congratulations again.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.750
I'll see you next class.

15:09.833 --> 15:10.792
Okay.

15:10.875 --> 15:13.542
It's a cute lip color, though.

15:13.625 --> 15:16.000
Um, yeah, so apparently I'm
gonna be here late tonight

15:16.083 --> 15:17.792
between discussing the
paper with the students

15:17.875 --> 15:19.208
and my own readings
that I have to do for--

15:19.292 --> 15:22.083
Yes, yes. I know another long
night, but I really need you

15:22.167 --> 15:24.708
- to take care of this for me.
- Okay. No problem.

15:24.792 --> 15:26.125
- Thank you, Leslie.
- Got it.

17:15.375 --> 17:16.375
Help!

17:44.292 --> 17:48.375
I'm sure you all
heard about what

17:48.458 --> 17:51.292
happened to Leslie already.

17:51.375 --> 17:54.333
Needless to say, today's
class will be canceled.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.500
Please, uh, come in.

18:05.958 --> 18:09.542
Uh, these, uh, detectives would
like to have a word with you.

18:09.625 --> 18:11.583
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.542
This is my card
in case any of you

18:13.625 --> 18:14.917
have heard anything or
have any details

18:15.000 --> 18:16.875
regarding Leslie's murder.

18:16.958 --> 18:19.542
We also have a photo of the
potential suspect that was

18:19.625 --> 18:20.750
captured on the security cam.

18:23.958 --> 18:25.875
I'll make sure to make some
copies and hand them out.

18:25.958 --> 18:26.833
Thank you.

18:26.917 --> 18:28.208
Thank you.

18:28.292 --> 18:29.500
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.

18:29.583 --> 18:30.583
Thank you.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.208
Hold on.

18:50.333 --> 18:51.333
Come in.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.083
Hi.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.542
Hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

18:56.625 --> 18:57.542
No, no.
Please.

18:57.625 --> 18:58.625
Come in, have a seat.

19:01.292 --> 19:02.542
How can I help you?

19:02.625 --> 19:05.542
Actually, I was coming
to check up on you.

19:05.625 --> 19:07.833
Very kind of you.

19:07.917 --> 19:10.000
I'm still trying to
process all of this.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.167
You know?

19:12.250 --> 19:13.542
Leslie was a great person.

19:13.625 --> 19:16.042
She didn't deserve
what happened to her.

19:16.125 --> 19:17.625
Well, listen.

19:17.708 --> 19:19.958
If it makes you feel any
better, I'd like to offer you

19:20.042 --> 19:22.125
a steak and eggs dinner on me.

19:22.208 --> 19:24.500
I mean, at this point, I
kind of owe you my life.

19:24.583 --> 19:27.083
You gotta let me repay
the debt somehow.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.042
Maybe another time.

19:29.125 --> 19:32.375
Right now, I don't have
much of an appetite.

19:32.458 --> 19:34.500
Okay.

19:34.583 --> 19:37.250
Well, I have another favor.

19:37.333 --> 19:40.000
Leslie was giving me
rides home from work.

19:40.083 --> 19:43.042
She was so sweet to
help me out for that.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.458
I should've known
something was wrong when

19:44.542 --> 19:46.917
she didn't respond to my texts.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.667
I'm sorry, I had no idea that
you two had gotten that close.

19:49.750 --> 19:52.958
Yeah, I went to her to
ask her for help on a paper.

19:53.042 --> 19:55.333
And from there, she
let me open up to her

19:55.417 --> 19:56.917
and she offered to help me.

19:59.375 --> 20:02.458
It sounds like Leslie.

20:02.542 --> 20:04.292
Always going the extra mile.

20:06.333 --> 20:07.167
I'm-- I'm sorry.
Yes--

20:07.250 --> 20:09.333
You know what?
I'm sorry.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.375
- I shouldn't have asked.
- No.

20:10.458 --> 20:12.083
- It's inappropriate.
- No, no, no.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.625
It's fine. Uh--

20:13.708 --> 20:15.417
What time do you need
me to pick you up?

20:15.500 --> 20:18.125
Well, I get off at 9:00,
but if you come in at 8:30

20:18.208 --> 20:21.833
I can have that steak and
eggs plate ready for you.

20:21.917 --> 20:23.750
Sounds like I'll
be there at 8:30.

20:23.833 --> 20:26.083
Great.

20:37.542 --> 20:38.708
Ah, right on time.

20:38.792 --> 20:40.167
Just how I like it.

20:40.250 --> 20:43.083
Go ahead and sit anywhere.

20:43.167 --> 20:45.042
Okay. Thanks.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.042
I've got your steak
cooking right now.

21:02.125 --> 21:03.792
What side would you like?

21:03.875 --> 21:05.500
Toast and hash.

21:05.583 --> 21:08.417
Okay. You want something a
little stronger than water?

21:08.500 --> 21:10.667
I've got a little personal
stash in the back.

21:10.750 --> 21:11.583
No, water's fine.

21:11.667 --> 21:14.208
You sure?
Could be our little secret.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.792
I don't drink.

21:17.875 --> 21:20.208
Never?
Or not anymore?

21:22.208 --> 21:23.875
Anymore.

21:23.958 --> 21:26.667
Interesting.
I'll be right back.

21:29.042 --> 21:30.417
I'm not doing this.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.375
What the hell are
you doing here?

21:33.458 --> 21:34.833
Get up.

21:34.917 --> 21:35.958
Get up and go.

21:38.917 --> 21:41.542
I-- I--

21:41.625 --> 21:43.917
Ah, food's here.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.292
I had them prepare
your steak medium well,

21:47.375 --> 21:51.375
and your hash browns
will be right out.

21:51.458 --> 21:55.208
Uh-- looks perfect.

21:58.292 --> 22:00.708
Good.

22:00.792 --> 22:04.958
What a long, weird,
twisted day, right?

22:05.042 --> 22:09.708
So how's work coming along?

22:09.792 --> 22:12.708
It's as pleasant as working
any night shift in a diner

22:12.792 --> 22:13.792
could be.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.250
I'm like Cinderella around here.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.458
It's very glamorous.

22:17.542 --> 22:19.625
So what'd you do before this?

22:19.708 --> 22:21.042
Before the diner?

22:21.125 --> 22:22.375
No, before LA.

22:22.458 --> 22:24.083
I'm sorry, I saw on your
resume that you worked

22:24.167 --> 22:25.875
a few places out of town.

22:25.958 --> 22:28.458
Ah, I was in the military,
stationed in Germany.

22:28.542 --> 22:30.542
And then I did
two years in Iraq.

22:30.625 --> 22:31.708
Wow.

22:31.792 --> 22:33.042
Thank you for your services.

22:33.125 --> 22:34.417
Yeah, I guess.
Listen.

22:34.500 --> 22:38.583
You better eat up
before that gets cold.

22:38.667 --> 22:39.500
Yeah, um--

22:53.333 --> 22:55.208
Mm.

22:55.292 --> 22:57.083
You were right.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.875
That is good.

22:58.958 --> 22:59.958
Oh.

23:09.042 --> 23:10.083
You're blushing.

23:10.167 --> 23:13.125
That's cute.

23:13.208 --> 23:15.958
I'm gonna check on your
hash browns and let you finish.

23:16.042 --> 23:18.625
I have a few things to do around
here and then we can go, okay?

23:35.458 --> 23:36.792
This is me right here.

23:41.458 --> 23:43.542
Hey, thanks again, Professor.

23:43.625 --> 23:45.333
It's like you're
always saving me.

23:45.417 --> 23:47.500
Call me Tom.

23:47.583 --> 23:49.042
Don't worry about it.

23:49.125 --> 23:51.833
I was a college student once.

23:51.917 --> 23:57.292
So, Tom, are you full?

23:57.375 --> 23:59.125
I'm stuffed.

23:59.208 --> 24:02.833
Might as well try and
get to a bed ASAP.

24:02.917 --> 24:03.917
Sounds like fun.

24:07.250 --> 24:10.875
No, I-- look, I didn't
mean it like that.

24:10.958 --> 24:13.167
You're blushing.
Again.

24:18.667 --> 24:21.417
Tracy, you're
a beautiful girl.

24:21.500 --> 24:22.875
I'm 26.

24:22.958 --> 24:24.000
I'm far from a girl, okay?

24:24.083 --> 24:24.917
I'm sorry.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.625
You're a beautiful woman.

24:27.708 --> 24:29.458
But I'm practically
twice your age.

24:29.542 --> 24:30.792
And?

24:30.875 --> 24:34.375
And not to mention,
you're also my student.

24:34.458 --> 24:37.083
It's not illegal for us to
enjoy each other's time, Tom.

24:37.167 --> 24:38.000
No.

24:38.083 --> 24:39.917
No, it's not.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.667
But it is unethical.

24:41.750 --> 24:44.083
And if anyone was to
find out, then, like,

24:44.167 --> 24:46.083
I could lose my job.

24:46.167 --> 24:48.583
Look, I'm-- I'm gonna
be straight with you.

24:48.667 --> 24:52.375
I'm just coming off of what was
over a year long sabbatical.

24:52.458 --> 24:55.750
So I can't afford to be
a part of any scandal.

24:55.833 --> 24:58.833
I can keep a secret.

24:58.917 --> 25:00.000
Listen.

25:00.083 --> 25:06.667
I think that you
should reconsider.

25:06.750 --> 25:08.417
Okay?

25:08.500 --> 25:11.958
I just got back and, um--

25:12.042 --> 25:13.375
I really can't do this.

25:13.458 --> 25:15.417
I just got back.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.708
And, um-- wait, I--

25:18.792 --> 25:21.250
look, uh-- stop. Stop.
All right?

25:21.333 --> 25:23.750
Uh, this can't happen.

25:23.833 --> 25:27.417
Well, I can feel
that you're not gay.

25:27.500 --> 25:28.583
So what is it?

25:28.667 --> 25:29.583
You married?

25:29.667 --> 25:31.500
Or divorced?

25:31.583 --> 25:32.583
Divorced.

25:34.708 --> 25:39.625
Well, clearly,
you're not over it.

25:39.708 --> 25:41.667
But that's okay.

25:41.750 --> 25:45.208
If you need help getting over
it, you know where to find me.

25:48.375 --> 25:49.750
You still love her?

25:53.667 --> 25:54.667
Right.

26:17.750 --> 26:18.667
Megan.

26:18.750 --> 26:19.750
Come on.

26:19.833 --> 26:21.000
I just need to talk
to you for a second.

26:21.083 --> 26:22.958
Thomas, is that you?

26:23.042 --> 26:25.125
Thomas, what the hell
are you doing here?

26:25.208 --> 26:26.042
Look, I'm sorry.

26:26.125 --> 26:27.333
I-- I've been calling
Megan on the phone.

26:27.417 --> 26:28.333
She's not picking up.
I need to talk--

26:28.417 --> 26:29.458
Honey, it is after midnight.

26:29.542 --> 26:31.083
Yes, I know. I just need to
talk to her for a second.

26:31.167 --> 26:32.000
- Mom, mom, mom.
- Wh-- what?

26:32.083 --> 26:33.083
- What?
- I-- no, I have it.

26:33.167 --> 26:34.375
- Let me-- I got this, mom.
- You sure, honey?

26:34.458 --> 26:35.958
Yes. Thank you.

26:37.042 --> 26:38.375
Alright.

26:38.458 --> 26:40.250
Thomas, what the hell
are you doing here?

26:40.333 --> 26:41.208
When'd your mother move in?

26:41.292 --> 26:43.375
What do you want, Thomas?

26:43.458 --> 26:44.958
You know, Brittany's
asleep upstairs,

26:45.042 --> 26:46.792
not to mention the
fact that I have two

26:46.875 --> 26:48.125
houses to show in the morning.

26:48.208 --> 26:49.417
Look.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.333
I just need to talk
to you for a second.

26:50.417 --> 26:51.375
Can I come in?

27:00.958 --> 27:02.042
What do you want, Thomas?

27:12.917 --> 27:15.000
I miss you.

27:15.083 --> 27:20.167
I just want to know if we're
working towards something,

27:20.250 --> 27:22.333
towards fixing us.

27:22.417 --> 27:24.208
Fixing us?

27:24.292 --> 27:25.833
Is that what you've been
worried about, Thomas?

27:25.917 --> 27:27.125
Fixing us?

27:27.208 --> 27:28.208
Look, I--

27:28.292 --> 27:31.042
I know I wasn't there for
you when you needed me.

27:31.125 --> 27:32.750
Look, Thomas.

27:32.833 --> 27:39.458
I used to beg you to worry about
fixing us before we were broken.

27:39.542 --> 27:41.625
But you don't even
remember that because you

27:41.708 --> 27:43.750
were too blackout drunk.

27:43.833 --> 27:44.958
You know why I drank.

27:45.042 --> 27:46.958
Of course I know
why you drank.

27:47.042 --> 27:50.250
I never blamed you for what
happened and I never will.

27:50.333 --> 27:53.042
You're a good father.

27:53.125 --> 27:57.000
But what I will blame you
for is what happened after.

27:57.083 --> 28:00.083
Because that bottle
became your shoulder

28:00.167 --> 28:03.792
to cry on instead of me.

28:03.875 --> 28:05.250
Where was my shoulder, Thomas?

28:05.333 --> 28:08.625
Where was my shoulder?

28:08.708 --> 28:09.542
Megan, I--

28:09.625 --> 28:11.042
You know what?

28:11.125 --> 28:12.625
You really even
shouldn't be worried

28:12.708 --> 28:14.833
about fixing us right now.

28:14.917 --> 28:16.292
What you need to
worry about fixing

28:16.375 --> 28:19.375
is that little girl
that's sleeping upstairs.

28:19.458 --> 28:22.750
Repairing her memory
of seeing her father

28:22.833 --> 28:25.250
coming in in the middle
of the day, all the time,

28:25.333 --> 28:26.833
blackout drunk.

28:26.917 --> 28:28.917
Okay?
You fix that, Thomas.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.625
Fix that. Okay?

28:30.708 --> 28:31.583
Fix that.

28:38.583 --> 28:41.750
Tell Diane that, uh,
I'm sorry for waking her.

28:41.833 --> 28:43.583
- Thomas.
- No.

28:43.667 --> 28:44.667
It's fine.

28:57.500 --> 28:58.500
Hey.

29:05.083 --> 29:07.958
The hardest thing in the world
is to reject the man you love.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.667
Mom, I can't--

29:13.750 --> 29:15.625
Oh, honey.

29:15.708 --> 29:17.583
No, don't cry.

29:17.667 --> 29:18.500
Come on.

29:18.583 --> 29:19.667
I know, baby.

29:19.750 --> 29:20.958
It's gonna be all right.

29:21.042 --> 29:23.125
It's gonna be all
right, I promise.

29:23.208 --> 29:25.000
Okay?

29:25.083 --> 29:26.458
It'll be all right.

29:39.458 --> 29:40.292
Knock knock.

29:42.917 --> 29:45.208
Tracy.

29:45.292 --> 29:46.750
Uh, Miss Jacobs.

29:46.833 --> 29:48.125
Professor Lewis.

29:48.208 --> 29:50.458
Didn't see you in class today.

29:50.542 --> 29:52.542
I couldn't show my
face in there after what

29:52.625 --> 29:53.625
happened the other night.

30:02.625 --> 30:03.625
You know what?

30:06.542 --> 30:08.792
Why don't we just forget it?

30:08.875 --> 30:09.875
No.

30:09.958 --> 30:11.500
I was inappropriate.

30:11.583 --> 30:15.417
And you were being
the perfect gentleman.

30:15.500 --> 30:16.792
Can't forget it.

30:16.875 --> 30:19.708
Look, we all do things
we shouldn't have done.

30:19.792 --> 30:22.542
Sometimes we make
mistakes we regret.

30:22.625 --> 30:24.875
I didn't say I
regretted anything.

30:24.958 --> 30:30.167
I mean, you're cute, you're
smart, you're single.

30:30.250 --> 30:32.750
An opportunity presented
itself and I took it.

30:32.833 --> 30:35.292
Miss Jacobs.

30:35.375 --> 30:39.333
Listen, I'm just saying
my offer still stands.

30:39.417 --> 30:41.583
You forgot what it feels
like to be desired.

30:48.667 --> 30:51.542
Look, uh--

30:51.625 --> 30:54.833
This has gone far
beyond appropriate.

30:54.917 --> 30:57.417
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.792
No.

30:59.875 --> 31:01.875
I'm not stupid.

31:01.958 --> 31:02.958
I know you want me.

31:06.125 --> 31:08.250
It doesn't matter what I want.

31:08.333 --> 31:09.792
It's the only
thing that matters.

32:36.875 --> 32:40.208
Hey. Oh, sorry I took so long.

32:40.292 --> 32:41.917
Oh.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.542
Ooh, I spilled this on me.
Do you have napkins?

32:43.625 --> 32:45.792
No, no.
We have napkins right, uh--

32:48.375 --> 32:51.125
What is this?

32:51.208 --> 32:52.125
Let me get that.

32:52.208 --> 32:53.792
Is this her?

32:53.875 --> 32:55.583
Your ex-wife?

32:55.667 --> 32:56.667
She's pretty.

32:59.583 --> 33:01.042
Yeah.

33:01.125 --> 33:02.500
That's her.

33:02.583 --> 33:03.458
Oh, my gosh.

33:03.542 --> 33:05.333
Is this your daughter?

33:05.417 --> 33:06.667
She is adorable.

33:06.750 --> 33:08.375
She's your twin.

33:08.458 --> 33:09.792
Let me-- let me--

33:09.875 --> 33:12.208
Tom, I thought you said
you only had one kid.

33:15.708 --> 33:16.708
I do.

33:19.375 --> 33:23.167
Megan named him after me.

33:23.250 --> 33:26.000
I was excited to
have a junior.

33:26.083 --> 33:29.417
He was a great kid.

33:29.500 --> 33:33.917
Then one summer,
Megan, my ex-wife, she

33:34.000 --> 33:35.167
had to go out and
show some houses

33:35.250 --> 33:39.125
and, um, she left
me with the kids.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.417
I remember Brittany,
she was taking a nap,

33:47.125 --> 33:49.833
and I put Junior in the crib.

33:55.417 --> 33:57.250
I can't remember, you know--

34:01.792 --> 34:03.125
did I put him on his side?

34:03.208 --> 34:04.333
Did I put him on his back?

34:08.083 --> 34:12.042
It go-- it goes and plays
over and over in my head.

34:12.125 --> 34:16.708
But I-- I can't remember.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.542
But I remember the phone rang.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.500
It was my publisher.

34:24.583 --> 34:28.125
He was all excited
about my new book.

34:28.208 --> 34:35.042
Projected sales, all kind of
nonsense things like that.

34:39.583 --> 34:42.333
I remember I had a
few glasses of wine.

34:42.417 --> 34:46.333
And I'm thinking, like,
man, I don't know.

34:50.833 --> 34:53.875
Maybe it was an hour.

34:53.958 --> 34:57.417
But when I look back,
it was like an eternity.

35:02.958 --> 35:05.208
Because when I went back
in that room...

35:10.875 --> 35:12.583
he was blue.

35:14.375 --> 35:17.208
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

35:17.292 --> 35:18.167
SIDS.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.542
That's what they call it.

35:19.625 --> 35:22.042
Happens in one in
every thousand infants.

35:22.125 --> 35:23.750
And my--

35:25.458 --> 35:28.583
Junior, he-- he
had to be the one.

35:34.917 --> 35:36.917
You know, there's two things--

35:37.000 --> 35:39.125
Two things that'll haunt
me for the rest of my life.

35:39.208 --> 35:40.458
And that's...

35:43.167 --> 35:47.875
seeing my
son blue in that crib.

35:52.375 --> 35:56.292
And then to tell his mother
and look in her eyes.

35:56.375 --> 36:00.083
And tell her, your son...

36:03.250 --> 36:06.167
our boy, he's gone.

36:06.250 --> 36:07.250
He's gone.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.292
You know, she never accused me.

36:14.375 --> 36:16.167
Not one time.
Not one time.

36:16.250 --> 36:17.833
Never said one accusatory word.

36:17.917 --> 36:18.792
But she didn't have to.

36:18.875 --> 36:19.875
No.

36:23.208 --> 36:25.375
I did that all by myself.

36:32.083 --> 36:33.083
You know, I couldn't face--

36:33.167 --> 36:34.000
I couldn't face her.

36:34.083 --> 36:35.208
I couldn't face my--

36:35.292 --> 36:38.333
my daughter, Brittany.

36:38.417 --> 36:41.667
All I could do was drink.

36:41.750 --> 36:44.875
I had to drink.

36:44.958 --> 36:46.583
Malt liquor, drink that.

36:46.667 --> 36:47.917
Vodka, drink that.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.167
Tequila, I don't want no shots.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.250
Drink that.

36:55.583 --> 36:57.375
It's all I knew
that would allow me

36:57.458 --> 37:02.708
to look at myself in the
mirror every day...

37:02.792 --> 37:06.167
and Megan, she--
she tried.

37:06.250 --> 37:07.250
She tried.

37:10.667 --> 37:14.250
But all I knew was
to push her away.

37:14.333 --> 37:17.417
Push everyone away.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.250
Megan, she had to realize
she had to take care

37:20.333 --> 37:21.875
of herself, and-- and Brittany.

37:21.958 --> 37:27.917
And three DUIs later, and a
little stint in jail, well--

37:32.417 --> 37:34.208
She gave me divorce papers.

37:34.292 --> 37:36.542
1:36 PM on a Thursday.

37:36.625 --> 37:38.250
She gave them to me.
I signed them.

37:38.333 --> 37:39.500
Didn't even look at it.

37:39.583 --> 37:41.417
I signed away my
rights to my daughter

37:41.500 --> 37:43.125
because I knew...

37:46.375 --> 37:48.875
they were better
without me.

37:51.792 --> 37:53.917
And I was better without
them because, you know,

37:54.042 --> 37:56.792
at least I had the bottle.

37:56.875 --> 38:01.125
Took me six months to get up
enough courage to go to AA, and...

38:04.292 --> 38:08.250
another three
months to stop drinking.

38:08.333 --> 38:12.458
So this is what you want?

38:12.542 --> 38:15.458
To never drink again?

38:15.542 --> 38:16.542
It's the best.

38:19.708 --> 38:20.833
Yeah, bro.

38:20.917 --> 38:24.833
So you say, um,
she's your student?

38:24.917 --> 38:25.917
Bro.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.958
Have you lost your mind?

38:28.042 --> 38:29.458
No, c-- man, you know what?

38:29.542 --> 38:31.083
I knew you were
gonna say that.

38:31.167 --> 38:32.583
That's why I didn't
want to tell you.

38:32.667 --> 38:34.833
You damn right I
was gonna say that.

38:34.917 --> 38:36.458
Because you have lost it.

38:36.542 --> 38:37.750
I didn't pursue her.

38:37.833 --> 38:39.125
She pursued me.

38:39.208 --> 38:40.917
Meh, I didn't pursue
her, she pursued me.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.583
I don't care who
pursued who, man.

38:43.667 --> 38:44.542
Wait.

38:44.625 --> 38:46.083
Wait, how old is she, man?

38:46.167 --> 38:47.542
Please don't tell me she's 18.

38:47.625 --> 38:48.917
She's not 18.

38:50.625 --> 38:51.583
Well, how old is she?

38:51.667 --> 38:52.833
Look.

38:52.917 --> 38:55.250
There's something
about this woman.

38:55.333 --> 38:58.042
It's like she's exactly
what I need right now.

38:58.125 --> 39:00.250
Oh, she exactly what
you need right now.

39:00.333 --> 39:01.750
But is she 18?

39:01.833 --> 39:02.667
She's 26.

39:02.750 --> 39:06.000
What you need is a swift
kick in your ass right now.

39:06.083 --> 39:07.500
That's what you need, man.

39:07.583 --> 39:09.583
What if the faculty finds
out that you sleeping

39:09.667 --> 39:11.583
with one of your students?

39:11.667 --> 39:13.875
Then what happens?

39:13.958 --> 39:17.417
Maybe I get reprimanded or
suspension, ma-- maybe worse.

39:17.500 --> 39:18.667
Shh.

39:18.750 --> 39:21.375
So it's worth risking
all that, huh?

39:21.458 --> 39:22.667
Come on, man.

39:22.750 --> 39:24.042
Look.

39:24.125 --> 39:25.583
You're not just my AA
sponsor, all right?

39:25.667 --> 39:26.625
You're my best friend.

39:26.708 --> 39:28.708
So you know everything about me.

39:28.792 --> 39:31.208
This is the first woman that
I've been with since Megan.

39:31.292 --> 39:33.833
Look, look, I'm talking...

39:33.917 --> 39:38.667
raw, animalistic distraction.

39:39.458 --> 39:41.625
- All right.
- Wait, wait, wait.

39:41.708 --> 39:43.333
- Wait.
- You talkin' 'bout...

39:43.417 --> 39:47.542
Raw, animalistic distraction.

39:47.625 --> 39:49.250
- There you go.
- All right, I get it.

39:49.333 --> 39:50.167
All right, all right.

39:50.250 --> 39:51.583
Okay, I understand.

39:51.667 --> 39:52.708
I-- I get it, all right?

39:52.792 --> 39:56.250
But I just-- just
be careful, man.

39:56.333 --> 40:00.125
Alright? Hey, you know
what they say, right?

40:00.208 --> 40:02.583
The easiest time to
start a new addiction...

40:03.792 --> 40:06.917
is when you getting
over an old one.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.083
- Food for thought.
- Food for thought.

40:08.167 --> 40:09.000
Yeah.

40:09.083 --> 40:12.375
From my AA sponsor who brings
me back to my old watering hole.

40:12.458 --> 40:13.583
Drink your water.

40:13.667 --> 40:15.917
Okay, all right.

40:19.708 --> 40:21.167
Totally not a big deal.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.250
You sure we're gonna
make our reservations?

40:23.333 --> 40:24.417
Yes, I'm sure.

40:24.500 --> 40:27.292
I just need 5 minutes,
10 minutes tops.

40:27.375 --> 40:28.583
I just gotta freshen up.

40:28.667 --> 40:30.583
You know you're perfect
as you are, right?

40:30.667 --> 40:32.583
Thank you.
Give me 5 minutes.

40:32.667 --> 40:33.667
Go sit down.

40:44.750 --> 40:45.583
Hey.

40:45.667 --> 40:46.667
Is this a picture of you?

40:46.750 --> 40:48.375
Yeah.

40:48.458 --> 40:51.625
Why is it I never
noticed it before?

40:51.708 --> 40:54.542
You come in here and you
go straight to the bed.

40:54.625 --> 40:56.042
You don't notice
anything in here.

40:59.333 --> 41:00.625
When'd you take this picture?

41:03.333 --> 41:04.875
It was taken the
night my parents died.

41:08.250 --> 41:10.958
What?

41:11.042 --> 41:12.000
Not a big deal.

41:12.083 --> 41:14.542
I was five years old.
I barely remember.

41:14.625 --> 41:16.625
All I know is there was a fire.

41:16.708 --> 41:19.042
I made it out. They didn't.

41:19.125 --> 41:23.250
Some jerk photographer took
my picture, and there it is.

41:23.333 --> 41:24.167
You have any siblings?

41:24.250 --> 41:27.333
Nope. Just me.

41:27.417 --> 41:29.167
So what happened to you
after your parents died?

41:32.042 --> 41:35.917
I moved from foster home to
foster home until I turned 18.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.542
I decided to go in the military.

41:37.625 --> 41:39.375
Why is it that I'm just
finding out about this?

41:39.458 --> 41:43.667
Because I was trying to avoid
these awkward conversations.

41:43.750 --> 41:46.417
And now that you
know everything,

41:46.500 --> 41:49.208
can I finish getting dressed?

41:49.292 --> 41:50.167
Yeah, yeah.

41:50.250 --> 41:51.250
Thanks.

42:00.375 --> 42:01.792
You know, I could
just imagine that--

42:01.875 --> 42:04.542
Please.

42:04.625 --> 42:05.875
Do you knock?

42:05.958 --> 42:07.583
What's that?

42:07.667 --> 42:09.458
Come on, come on.
Give me-- let me see.

42:11.000 --> 42:11.875
I'll open it for you.

42:15.208 --> 42:16.875
Clozapine.

42:16.958 --> 42:20.250
What's that for?

42:20.333 --> 42:21.333
Goodness.

42:24.958 --> 42:25.875
All right.

42:25.958 --> 42:27.000
What's going on?

42:27.083 --> 42:28.542
Come on. Talk to me.

42:32.792 --> 42:38.875
Well, if you must know,
they're antidepressants.

42:38.958 --> 42:41.667
I suffer from post-traumatic
stress disorder

42:41.750 --> 42:44.333
from being in the
military, and a doctor

42:44.417 --> 42:47.208
prescribes them for me.

42:47.292 --> 42:48.958
Okay. Well, I guess
I'm learning all

42:49.042 --> 42:51.250
kind of new stuff
about you tonight.

42:51.333 --> 42:52.500
It's not that bad, really.

42:52.583 --> 42:54.375
I just hate taking
them because I

42:54.458 --> 42:59.833
start feeling weird
and foggy, almost

42:59.917 --> 43:02.917
like I'm not my natural self.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.750
Come here.

43:05.833 --> 43:09.458
It's all right.

43:09.542 --> 43:11.833
You're an amazing woman.

43:11.917 --> 43:15.708
And I'm in awe of you right now.

43:15.792 --> 43:17.625
Really?

43:17.708 --> 43:19.500
Absolutely.

43:19.583 --> 43:22.208
After all that you've
been through, pulling

43:22.292 --> 43:23.750
yourself up by the bootstraps.

43:23.833 --> 43:27.083
Look, if those pills, they
make you feel like that,

43:27.167 --> 43:28.375
then I'm sorry.

43:28.458 --> 43:30.667
It's a shame.

43:30.750 --> 43:33.167
Because I enjoy getting
to know the natural you.

43:33.250 --> 43:35.875
You do?

43:35.958 --> 43:36.833
Of course I do.

43:40.667 --> 43:44.542
I think we should
stay in tonight.

43:44.625 --> 43:45.500
You do?

43:45.583 --> 43:46.708
Yeah.

43:46.792 --> 43:48.167
I have a surprise
for you I've been

43:48.250 --> 43:49.625
wanting to give you anyway.

43:49.708 --> 43:54.042
So I'm gonna go get
ready for the surprise.

43:54.125 --> 43:58.958
You get in the bed, and I'll
get your surprise ready.

43:59.042 --> 44:01.167
Surprises.

44:01.250 --> 44:04.292
I like surprises.

44:11.125 --> 44:13.875
- You like?
- Oh, yeah. I like.

44:16.208 --> 44:17.625
Lay down.

44:17.708 --> 44:21.417
And what are you
gonna do with those?

44:21.500 --> 44:27.292
These are part of my surprise.

44:30.750 --> 44:33.042
Are you nervous?

44:33.125 --> 44:34.000
I don't know.

44:34.083 --> 44:35.375
Should I be?

44:35.458 --> 44:37.625
No. Maybe a little.

44:42.083 --> 44:43.417
So.

44:43.500 --> 44:45.083
You ready for the surprise?

44:45.167 --> 44:46.792
I hope this is nothing
to do with a feather

44:46.875 --> 44:50.625
because it's unmanly
how ticklish I am.

44:50.708 --> 44:53.042
It's not feathers.

44:54.667 --> 44:55.625
Okay, close your eyes.

44:58.833 --> 45:00.125
- Open your mouth.
- Hm?

45:00.208 --> 45:01.083
What?

45:01.167 --> 45:03.542
Open your mouth.

45:03.625 --> 45:04.625
Open it.

45:09.917 --> 45:11.042
What are you doing?

45:11.125 --> 45:13.125
I'm being your
serpent in the tree.

45:13.208 --> 45:14.667
You know you want it.

45:14.750 --> 45:17.708
And I won't tell anyone,
especially your ex.

45:17.792 --> 45:18.708
No.

45:18.792 --> 45:20.667
Stop.

45:20.750 --> 45:21.750
Why?

45:21.833 --> 45:23.833
Because of some AA pledge?

45:23.917 --> 45:25.292
They don't know anything.

45:25.375 --> 45:28.250
They just tell you to
suppress your urges.

45:28.333 --> 45:31.417
Life is about giving in.

45:31.500 --> 45:32.833
You can be free here.

45:32.917 --> 45:35.458
I want you to be your true self.

45:35.542 --> 45:37.833
So have a drink with me.

45:37.917 --> 45:39.125
I won't tell anyone.

47:35.417 --> 47:37.917
Hey.

47:38.042 --> 47:39.833
What you doing out here?

47:39.917 --> 47:41.167
I was looking all over for you.

47:41.250 --> 47:43.542
Did you get my note?

47:43.625 --> 47:49.917
No. I didn't get your note, but
I saw you through the window.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.417
This is amazing.

47:52.500 --> 47:54.292
I come out here.

47:54.375 --> 47:58.125
I like to feel the wind.

47:58.208 --> 48:00.042
This is my safe place.

48:00.125 --> 48:01.875
Clear out all the
noise in my head.

48:01.958 --> 48:02.958
Mm.

48:05.708 --> 48:12.625
Well, your safe place is, um,
not that good for my migraine.

48:12.708 --> 48:15.458
You got a hangover?

48:15.542 --> 48:18.333
Yeah, I guess you
can call it that.

48:18.417 --> 48:20.792
I need some Aspirin
or something.

48:23.583 --> 48:24.583
What time you got?

48:29.750 --> 48:30.875
12:42.

48:33.958 --> 48:34.958
I got to get out of here.

48:38.042 --> 48:39.958
What's wrong?

48:40.042 --> 48:41.292
I'm late.

48:41.375 --> 48:43.250
Late for what?

48:43.333 --> 48:45.792
Well, uh, need to
pick up my daughter

48:45.875 --> 48:48.125
and take her to
swimming lessons.

48:48.208 --> 48:51.125
And, well, it's gonna
take me at least 30 minutes

48:51.208 --> 48:54.542
and go home, change up,
I should take a shower.

48:54.625 --> 48:56.500
All right, well, let me
dressed. I'll go with you.

48:56.583 --> 48:58.333
Well, no.
No, no, no.

48:58.417 --> 49:00.750
I'm good, I'm good.

49:00.833 --> 49:02.750
Look, I, uh, I
couldn't find my phone.

49:02.833 --> 49:05.292
Where'd you put it?

49:05.375 --> 49:07.208
It's on the side of the bed.

49:07.292 --> 49:09.833
Why is it that you don't want
me to be around your daughter?

49:09.917 --> 49:12.292
It's like you don't want me
to meet her or something.

49:12.375 --> 49:15.167
- Why?
- Come on, really?

49:15.250 --> 49:16.083
Because.

49:16.167 --> 49:17.042
Because?

49:17.125 --> 49:18.333
Because is not an answer.

49:18.417 --> 49:20.042
Because why?

49:20.125 --> 49:23.458
It's a little too early for
all of that, don't you think?

49:23.542 --> 49:24.792
I mean, I got a
10-year-old daughter

49:24.875 --> 49:26.750
who's already wondering
why her daddy's not

49:26.833 --> 49:28.708
there tucking her in.

49:28.792 --> 49:30.875
Now she's going
to wonder why I'm

49:30.958 --> 49:35.708
30 minutes late or more, just
to take her to swimming lessons.

49:35.792 --> 49:37.833
The last thing I need to do is
add another adult in the mix

49:37.917 --> 49:41.125
so she has more
questions to ask.

49:41.208 --> 49:42.167
Okay?

49:42.250 --> 49:43.750
No.

49:43.833 --> 49:44.917
It's not okay.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.708
It's gonna have to be.

49:46.792 --> 49:47.875
Because you're not
gonna meet her.

49:51.458 --> 49:52.833
Come on.

49:52.917 --> 49:55.083
Give me a kiss. I got to go.
Come on.

50:01.792 --> 50:04.500
All right.

50:04.583 --> 50:06.417
Talk to you later, all right?
I got to--

50:06.500 --> 50:07.542
I got to get out of here.

50:16.750 --> 50:18.667
Thomas. You're late.

50:18.750 --> 50:21.333
Brittany, your dad's here.

50:21.417 --> 50:23.208
I missed an appointment
because of you.

50:23.292 --> 50:24.875
Megan, I'm sorry.
I-- I got caught up--

50:24.958 --> 50:26.417
Dad, you're late.

50:26.500 --> 50:28.875
You made mom miss an
appointment with a new client.

50:28.958 --> 50:32.083
You sound just
like your mother.

50:32.167 --> 50:34.000
Don't let it happen again.

50:34.083 --> 50:35.375
And are you still gonna
take me swimming?

50:39.125 --> 50:40.208
Well?

50:40.292 --> 50:42.583
Brittany, go get the swimsuit
your grandmother gave you, okay?

50:42.667 --> 50:43.667
Yes!

50:45.833 --> 50:49.208
Megan, um, I just want to
thank you again for this.

50:49.292 --> 50:52.833
I know you didn't
have to do this.

50:52.917 --> 50:53.958
What's going on with you?

50:54.042 --> 50:55.583
You okay?

50:55.667 --> 51:00.792
Uh, yeah, well, I'm worse
than some, better than most.

51:04.708 --> 51:06.875
And wh-- what is this?

51:06.958 --> 51:08.167
What?

51:08.250 --> 51:10.500
To be more dressed
down than normal?

51:10.583 --> 51:12.958
Come on dad, let's go.

51:13.042 --> 51:15.208
- Come on.
- You guys have fun.

51:21.917 --> 51:23.292
Bye, mom.

51:23.375 --> 51:24.750
Bye, honey.

51:24.833 --> 51:27.167
Oh, uh, I'll have
her call you before she

51:27.250 --> 51:28.083
goes to sleep tonight.

51:28.167 --> 51:29.167
Okay.

52:13.750 --> 52:15.083
<i>Okay, Tom.</i>

52:15.167 --> 52:17.958
<i>Maybe I overreacted a
little bit this morning.</i>

52:18.042 --> 52:19.042
<i>Just call me back, okay?</i>

52:28.417 --> 52:31.667
<i>Silence is not how we
solve problems, Tom.</i>

52:31.750 --> 52:32.667
<i>Call me back.</i>

52:39.750 --> 52:42.375
<i>Who the hell do
you think you are?</i>

52:42.458 --> 52:44.417
<i>How dare you ignore me?</i>

52:54.250 --> 52:55.250
<i>I can destroy you.</i>

53:20.000 --> 53:22.292
I'll just invite myself in.

53:24.583 --> 53:27.667
Look. All right, I don't want to
argue with you again, all right?

53:27.750 --> 53:29.250
Me neither, crazy.

53:29.333 --> 53:31.208
That's not what I'm here for.

53:31.292 --> 53:32.542
I came to give you a gift.

53:37.917 --> 53:39.042
What's this?

53:39.125 --> 53:40.458
It was my father's.

53:40.542 --> 53:42.417
It was the only thing
that survived the fire.

53:48.875 --> 53:50.042
I can't take this.

53:50.125 --> 53:51.417
Listen.

53:51.500 --> 53:54.958
I really, really
overreacted the other day.

53:55.042 --> 53:56.292
You don't deserve that.

53:56.375 --> 53:58.167
So I wanted you to
have this so you can

53:58.250 --> 54:00.042
know how much you mean to me.

54:00.125 --> 54:02.250
It's an apology gift.

54:02.333 --> 54:03.708
Look, Tracy.

54:03.792 --> 54:06.167
I accept your apology,
but I cannot take this.

54:09.542 --> 54:12.083
Are you just gonna forget about
all the hundred calls you made

54:12.167 --> 54:14.417
and the-- and the-- the
30-something voice messages

54:14.500 --> 54:16.625
you left me? Huh?

54:16.708 --> 54:18.333
Hold on.

54:18.417 --> 54:19.250
Hey, baby.

54:19.333 --> 54:20.667
What's going on, Brittany?

54:20.750 --> 54:22.375
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

54:22.458 --> 54:24.458
Slow down.
No. All right, look.

54:24.542 --> 54:26.042
I can't understand you.

54:26.125 --> 54:27.875
No-- I--

54:27.958 --> 54:29.958
Diane, what's going on?

54:30.042 --> 54:32.708
Oh. Oh, okay. Oh, my god.

54:32.792 --> 54:35.333
All right. All right, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:35.417 --> 54:37.667
I'm on my way right now.
Okay, I'm leaving. Bye.

54:39.167 --> 54:40.500
What's going on?

54:40.583 --> 54:42.500
Megan was in an accident.

54:42.583 --> 54:44.750
She's in the hospital.

54:44.833 --> 54:45.958
Is Brittany okay?

54:46.042 --> 54:47.292
Yeah, she was with
her grandmother.

54:47.375 --> 54:48.500
I have to go.

54:48.583 --> 54:49.542
We can go to the
hospital together.

54:49.625 --> 54:50.542
No, no, no.
Whoa, whoa.

54:50.625 --> 54:52.375
No, no. You can't come
with me, all right?

54:52.458 --> 54:53.833
- We've been over this.
- I'll go with you.

54:53.917 --> 54:54.875
No, no.
No.

54:54.958 --> 54:56.000
I got to go to the hospital.

54:56.083 --> 54:57.625
You got to leave.

54:57.708 --> 54:59.042
Well, we're not finished here.

54:59.125 --> 55:00.458
I'll just wait here
until you get back.

55:00.542 --> 55:03.667
I-- I don't have time
for this, all right?

55:03.750 --> 55:04.708
Look, I got to go.

55:04.792 --> 55:06.250
Lock up the door behind you.

55:23.292 --> 55:26.042
Thomas. Thomas.

55:26.125 --> 55:27.125
Dad.

55:28.542 --> 55:29.958
Oh, come here.

55:30.042 --> 55:33.292
Mommy's hurt.
Really bad.

55:33.375 --> 55:35.625
I know, baby. I know.

55:37.917 --> 55:40.292
So she just came
out of surgery.

55:40.375 --> 55:44.375
She had some, um, broken
bones and internal bleeding.

55:44.458 --> 55:46.208
And, oh, honey, I know.

55:46.292 --> 55:47.708
I'm right here, baby.

55:47.792 --> 55:49.250
They caught all
that in time, but

55:49.333 --> 55:50.417
right now they're just
worried about the swelling

55:50.500 --> 55:51.333
in the brain.

55:51.417 --> 55:54.875
So they had to put her in
a medically induced coma.

55:54.958 --> 55:58.625
Hey, ho-- coma?

55:58.708 --> 56:00.042
Yeah.

56:00.125 --> 56:01.750
They don't know how
long it's gonna take.

56:01.833 --> 56:03.292
Like, days, weeks, I don't know.

56:03.375 --> 56:04.417
We just got to--

56:04.500 --> 56:05.958
we just got to hope and pray.

56:06.042 --> 56:07.167
Hey, hey.

56:07.250 --> 56:09.542
Daddy's right here.

56:09.625 --> 56:10.500
All right, babe?

56:10.583 --> 56:11.417
All right?

56:11.500 --> 56:13.167
It's okay.

56:14.083 --> 56:15.542
Stay with Nana.

56:15.625 --> 56:16.500
It's gonna be fine.

56:16.583 --> 56:18.208
Oh, honey. Don't cry.

56:18.292 --> 56:20.500
Please don't cry.
You're gonna make Nana cry.

56:28.708 --> 56:30.500
Okay.

56:47.208 --> 56:48.042
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

57:13.625 --> 57:14.625
Thomas.

57:16.292 --> 57:17.292
Thomas.

57:22.417 --> 57:23.833
Good morning.

57:26.292 --> 57:27.708
I must have dozed off.

57:30.500 --> 57:32.917
- Good morning.
- Morning.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.083
What time is it?

57:34.167 --> 57:36.667
I-- I got to get
Brittany to school.

57:36.750 --> 57:38.667
Already taken
care of, my love.

57:38.750 --> 57:40.375
Thank you.

57:40.458 --> 57:43.083
Ain't nothing but a thing.

57:43.167 --> 57:44.333
We all family here, honey.

57:48.458 --> 57:50.542
And thanks for this.

57:50.625 --> 57:54.000
Honey, why don't
you just go on home?

57:54.083 --> 57:56.542
I'll call you if
anything changes.

57:56.625 --> 57:57.625
Mm-mm.

58:00.167 --> 58:03.542
I can't get any rest
with her in here.

58:03.625 --> 58:05.708
Not like this.

58:05.792 --> 58:06.667
Well, you're not
gonna do her

58:06.750 --> 58:10.167
no good if you end up in the
bed right beside her, honey.

58:10.250 --> 58:12.292
Please, listen to me.
Go home.

58:12.375 --> 58:14.250
Take a shower.

58:14.333 --> 58:16.375
Lay your head on a pillow
and get some winks of sleep,

58:16.458 --> 58:19.792
and then come back here
nice and refreshed.

58:19.875 --> 58:22.542
You're gonna do
yourself and Megan a favor.

58:26.917 --> 58:28.167
Maybe you're right.

58:28.250 --> 58:29.250
You know I'm right.

58:32.167 --> 58:33.167
Okay.

58:47.875 --> 58:54.250
Diane, you know I must have
apologized to your daughter

58:54.333 --> 58:57.750
over 1,000 times for what
I did to our marriage.

58:57.833 --> 59:04.333
But, uh, I know after our
divorce you had to step up.

59:04.417 --> 59:05.708
I never got to say thank you.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.000
I'm sorry.

59:12.375 --> 59:14.917
Matthew 18:21-22.

59:18.708 --> 59:19.708
I'm not familiar.

59:22.583 --> 59:25.458
"Then came Peter
to him and said,

59:25.542 --> 59:29.792
Lord, how oft shall my brother
sin against me before I

59:29.875 --> 59:31.500
forgive him?

59:31.583 --> 59:34.458
Till seven times?

59:34.542 --> 59:38.458
Jesus saith unto
him, I do not say

59:38.542 --> 59:42.333
unto thee, till seven times.

59:42.417 --> 59:44.250
But until 70 times seven."

59:47.208 --> 59:50.958
I knew you were sorry
as soon as it happened.

59:51.042 --> 59:53.917
And I forgave you way back then.

59:54.000 --> 59:55.833
But it's way past time.

59:55.917 --> 59:58.750
You forgive yourself.

59:58.833 --> 59:59.833
Please.

01:00:07.292 --> 01:00:08.417
- I got to go.
- I know.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:10.875
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

01:00:40.125 --> 01:00:41.125
Tracy, Tracy, Tracy.

01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:42.375
What are you doing here?

01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:44.292
How was the hospital?

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:45.792
How's Brittany?

01:00:48.708 --> 01:00:51.667
What have you been doing?

01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:52.833
This.

01:00:52.917 --> 01:00:54.708
I moved this chair
here so I could

01:00:54.792 --> 01:00:56.125
be right here when you got in.

01:00:56.208 --> 01:00:57.250
Fine.

01:00:57.333 --> 01:00:58.250
Get up.

01:00:58.333 --> 01:01:00.292
Come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:01:00.375 --> 01:01:03.208
Come on, really?

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:04.917
Moving all this stuff around.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.875
Rearranging my stuff.

01:01:06.958 --> 01:01:08.667
I mean, what?

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:11.167
You've been here for the last
few days while I've been away?

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:14.417
I just wanted to
make sure you were okay.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.542
How's your ex-wife?

01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:18.333
Did she die?

01:01:18.417 --> 01:01:20.333
What'd you say?

01:01:20.417 --> 01:01:22.000
Why would you say
something like that?

01:01:22.083 --> 01:01:23.458
Oh, Tom.

01:01:23.542 --> 01:01:25.542
Because I care.

01:01:25.625 --> 01:01:27.333
I care, Tom.

01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:30.000
I was worried about you.

01:01:30.083 --> 01:01:31.167
I was really worried
about Brittany.

01:01:34.583 --> 01:01:35.500
Just stop.

01:01:35.583 --> 01:01:36.417
No, really.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.250
- Just stop.
- What?

01:01:38.333 --> 01:01:40.125
Look, I-- I--

01:01:40.208 --> 01:01:43.042
I just can't entertain
this anymore.

01:01:43.125 --> 01:01:45.208
What are you saying, Tom?

01:01:45.292 --> 01:01:47.667
I'm saying that we're done.

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:49.292
This is it.

01:01:49.375 --> 01:01:50.667
We're through, Tracy.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:53.167
All right? I don't have the
energy or-- or willingness

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:55.208
to even entertain
your antics anymore.

01:01:57.042 --> 01:01:58.625
- No.
- Yes.

01:01:58.708 --> 01:02:01.708
No. No. No.

01:02:01.792 --> 01:02:03.375
No, no.

01:02:03.458 --> 01:02:05.750
Look, the only priority I
have right now is to my family.

01:02:05.833 --> 01:02:09.000
All right? Not to anyone else,
and that includes you.

01:02:09.083 --> 01:02:11.375
Was your family a priority
when you killed your son?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.375
I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean that.

01:02:19.458 --> 01:02:20.542
- I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me.

01:02:20.625 --> 01:02:21.792
- I was out of line.
- Just stop.

01:02:21.875 --> 01:02:22.958
I was out of line.
I didn't mean it.

01:02:23.042 --> 01:02:24.000
- Don't touch me.
- I'm sorry.

01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:25.250
- Look.
- I'm sorry.

01:02:25.333 --> 01:02:26.458
- Get out.
- I didn't mean to say that.

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:27.875
- We can talk about it, Tom.
- Look.

01:02:27.958 --> 01:02:29.042
Get--
Look--

01:02:29.125 --> 01:02:30.208
- Let's talk about it.
- Get out.

01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:31.500
- Let's go.
- Let's talk about this.

01:02:31.583 --> 01:02:32.417
I said get out.
I want you out.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.083
You're hurting me. Ow.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:35.292
I want you out
of here, all right?

01:02:35.375 --> 01:02:36.500
No.
Tom.

01:02:36.583 --> 01:02:37.417
- Let's--
- Get out.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:38.542
Tom!

01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:39.750
And stay the
hell away from me.

01:02:39.833 --> 01:02:41.833
We need to talk about this.

01:02:41.917 --> 01:02:45.250
Tom. We belong together.

01:02:46.542 --> 01:02:47.542
Please.

01:02:49.167 --> 01:02:50.167
Please.

01:03:29.792 --> 01:03:30.792
Baby.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.875
Baby, if you
could hear me...

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:43.208
I need you to wake up.

01:03:45.833 --> 01:03:47.250
I need you to wake up.

01:03:52.542 --> 01:03:56.875
I can't imagine being in
this world without you.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.875
Brittany needs you.

01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:08.875
I need you.

01:04:15.875 --> 01:04:19.292
I love you.

01:04:19.375 --> 01:04:20.958
I love you so much.

01:04:25.333 --> 01:04:28.458
I love you, too.

01:04:28.542 --> 01:04:30.250
- Megan?
- Oh, my god.

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:31.583
Megan.

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:32.750
She's awake.

01:04:32.833 --> 01:04:33.833
Megan.

01:04:36.167 --> 01:04:37.667
- Oh, thank god.
- She's awake.

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:38.583
Thank god.

01:04:38.667 --> 01:04:40.875
Nurse! Nurse, she's awake!

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:47.417
Thank God. Thank God.

01:04:53.208 --> 01:04:55.083
Oh, I just never
want to let you go.

01:04:55.167 --> 01:04:56.417
I love you, Mom.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.208
I love you too, baby.

01:05:01.042 --> 01:05:03.083
Mom, can I get some candy?

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:04.625
Sure. You want Grandma or
Daddy to go with you?

01:05:04.708 --> 01:05:05.917
No, I know where it is.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.417
You sure you don't
want dad to just,

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.583
uh, come help you
push the buttons?

01:05:10.667 --> 01:05:11.917
Dad, I got it.

01:05:14.167 --> 01:05:16.542
Come here, baby.
I'll give you some change.

01:05:16.625 --> 01:05:18.042
We got $5.

01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:19.167
Machine's right
around the corner.

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:20.250
I think she'll be fine.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:21.167
Thanks, Grandma.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.625
- Hurry back, sweet pea.
- Okay, Mom.

01:05:23.708 --> 01:05:25.292
You're so grown.

01:05:25.375 --> 01:05:27.125
You sure you weren't speeding?

01:05:27.208 --> 01:05:29.500
No, Thomas.
I don't speed.

01:05:29.583 --> 01:05:31.208
I usually have the baby, so no.

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.833
Wow.

01:05:37.917 --> 01:05:40.042
You don't remember
anything else?

01:05:40.125 --> 01:05:41.125
No.

01:05:53.667 --> 01:05:54.792
Hey, Brittany.

01:05:54.875 --> 01:05:58.292
This one guy cutting me off.

01:05:58.375 --> 01:06:02.250
I swerved and tried to hit the
brakes, and they didn't work.

01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:07.458
Next thing I know, I'm slamming
into a concrete barrier.

01:06:07.542 --> 01:06:08.542
Then nothing.

01:06:11.375 --> 01:06:15.083
What's taking her so
long to get some candy?

01:06:15.167 --> 01:06:16.625
There you go.

01:06:16.708 --> 01:06:18.458
You're finally back.

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:19.542
See what you got.

01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:29.833
Where'd you get this?

01:06:29.917 --> 01:06:31.375
Tracy gave it to me.

01:06:33.667 --> 01:06:35.958
Tracy.

01:06:36.042 --> 01:06:40.458
Dad, why did she
say she's my stepmom?

01:06:43.792 --> 01:06:45.625
Baby, I need you to
stay with your grandma.

01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:46.708
Okay.

01:06:55.833 --> 01:06:56.833
Sorry.

01:07:12.833 --> 01:07:15.333
Just the man
we're looking for.

01:07:15.417 --> 01:07:17.458
- What's this about?
- You need to come with me.

01:07:17.542 --> 01:07:18.875
Get your hands off of me.

01:07:18.958 --> 01:07:20.542
You don't remember
us from the university?

01:07:20.625 --> 01:07:22.625
Because we remember you.

01:07:22.708 --> 01:07:24.250
What's this about?

01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:26.708
- You need to--
- Get your hands off of me.

01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:29.458
I got a ex-wife who just got out
of a coma a couple hours ago.

01:07:29.542 --> 01:07:32.917
I'm not going anywhere.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.250
Fine.

01:07:34.333 --> 01:07:36.958
You want to explain to her why
we got an anonymous tip stating

01:07:37.042 --> 01:07:38.833
that a certain professor
who's currently

01:07:38.917 --> 01:07:40.250
under a murder investigation,

01:07:40.333 --> 01:07:42.542
might have also cut his
ex-wife's brake lines?

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:43.542
What?

01:07:43.625 --> 01:07:45.542
You're coming with us.

01:07:45.625 --> 01:07:46.917
Tracy Jacobs, all right?

01:07:47.042 --> 01:07:48.500
I keep saying-- Tracy Jacobs.

01:07:48.583 --> 01:07:50.250
Maybe you're not
spelling it right.

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:52.292
We ran her name and all the
other information you gave us,

01:07:52.375 --> 01:07:53.458
and nothing came up.

01:07:53.542 --> 01:07:54.958
What about her apartment?

01:07:55.042 --> 01:07:56.625
We sent a unit to the
address, but the landlord

01:07:56.708 --> 01:07:59.167
told our officers that nobody
lives there by that name.

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:00.500
That's impossible.

01:08:00.583 --> 01:08:01.542
Look, I-- I've been there.

01:08:01.625 --> 01:08:02.958
I slept there.

01:08:03.042 --> 01:08:04.708
And you're saying this
fantasy woman of yours

01:08:04.792 --> 01:08:06.000
is your ticked off girlfriend?

01:08:06.083 --> 01:08:06.917
Was.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.042
Was your girlfriend.
Student.

01:08:09.125 --> 01:08:11.667
Look, look. You asked me
who I thought it might be.

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:13.583
All right?
And I'm-- I'm telling you.

01:08:13.667 --> 01:08:15.625
I mean, no person comes
up to a child and says,

01:08:15.708 --> 01:08:16.707
I'm gonna be your stepmom.

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.417
- Are you serious?
- That's right.

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.875
You felt threatened because she
gave your daughter a bracelet.

01:08:20.957 --> 01:08:22.707
That's right. Look.

01:08:22.792 --> 01:08:24.457
I-- I know how crazy it sounds.

01:08:24.542 --> 01:08:25.957
Sounds like a load of crap.

01:08:26.042 --> 01:08:28.207
You ask me, you're the
one with everything to lose.

01:08:28.292 --> 01:08:30.457
Ex-wife, ex-girlfriend,
cushy teaching job.

01:08:30.542 --> 01:08:31.542
Fine.

01:08:31.625 --> 01:08:32.750
Y'all don't want
to listen to me?

01:08:32.832 --> 01:08:33.832
All right, I'm
telling you, there's

01:08:33.917 --> 01:08:35.125
something off about this woman.

01:08:35.207 --> 01:08:36.875
If my ex-wife's brake
lines were cut,

01:08:36.957 --> 01:08:38.750
then that's who you
should be looking at.

01:09:13.625 --> 01:09:14.625
What is this?

01:09:18.792 --> 01:09:19.667
What is it?

01:09:19.750 --> 01:09:21.292
What is this?

01:09:24.582 --> 01:09:25.875
It's okay.

01:09:25.957 --> 01:09:27.957
Megan,
I would never do that.

01:09:28.042 --> 01:09:30.250
So this woman has been
around our daughter.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.667
No.

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:34.207
I never bought her
around Brittany.

01:09:34.292 --> 01:09:36.332
She must have followed me
to a visit or something.

01:09:40.625 --> 01:09:42.125
Do you love her?

01:09:42.207 --> 01:09:44.207
Just because I slept with
her doesn't mean I love her.

01:09:44.292 --> 01:09:45.292
I love you.

01:09:47.625 --> 01:09:49.332
Then get me out of here.

01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:51.207
- Okay, I want to go home.
- I know, baby. I know.

01:09:51.292 --> 01:09:53.042
- Get me out of here, now.
- I know, honey.

01:09:53.125 --> 01:09:54.292
- No, get me out of here.
- I'll be right back.

01:09:54.375 --> 01:09:56.250
Please, just wait
a second, all right?

01:10:02.083 --> 01:10:02.958
All right.

01:10:03.042 --> 01:10:04.375
- Diane.
- Yeah?

01:10:04.458 --> 01:10:05.667
Can you pick up
Brittany from school

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:06.875
and keep her with you tonight?

01:10:06.958 --> 01:10:10.792
Absolutely. All right.
I'll leave now.

01:10:10.875 --> 01:10:11.917
All right, baby.
I love you.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.208
Love you too, Mom.

01:10:13.292 --> 01:10:14.792
Bye.

01:10:14.875 --> 01:10:16.083
- Call you later.
- 'Kay.

01:10:18.667 --> 01:10:20.208
Do you think
Mom's gonna be okay?

01:10:21.792 --> 01:10:23.125
Mm-hm.

01:10:23.208 --> 01:10:25.875
I do believe she's
gonna be okay, honey.

01:10:25.958 --> 01:10:27.875
And you're gonna
come to my place

01:10:27.958 --> 01:10:30.958
and we're gonna have some
s'mores, and hot chocolate,

01:10:31.042 --> 01:10:35.208
and stay up late, and carry on.

01:10:35.292 --> 01:10:36.958
Hey, Brittany.

01:10:37.042 --> 01:10:38.208
Oh, can I go play
with him, please?

01:10:38.292 --> 01:10:39.500
Sure, babe.
Want me to hold that?

01:10:39.583 --> 01:10:40.458
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:10:40.542 --> 01:10:42.333
- Come on.
- Have fun.

01:11:00.167 --> 01:11:01.167
You're it!

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.875
Brittany?

01:11:22.542 --> 01:11:23.542
Brittany?

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:29.250
Brittany?

01:11:30.375 --> 01:11:32.083
Brittany?

01:11:32.167 --> 01:11:33.167
Did you see Brittany, honey?

01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:34.208
Did you see the little girl?

01:11:34.292 --> 01:11:35.292
You were just playing with her.

01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:36.333
She was here.

01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:37.625
But-- I-- she's not here anymore.

01:11:37.708 --> 01:11:39.792
She's not here?
Brittany.

01:11:39.875 --> 01:11:41.208
Brittany?

01:11:41.292 --> 01:11:43.833
Brittany. Brittany.

01:11:43.917 --> 01:11:45.500
- Brittany?
- Oh, my God.

01:11:45.583 --> 01:11:47.167
Where did she go?

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:48.083
Brittany?

01:11:48.167 --> 01:11:51.000
Is this 9-1-1?
Yeah. My granddaughter's missing.

01:11:51.208 --> 01:11:53.042
I was on the playground
the whole time.

01:11:53.125 --> 01:11:54.458
Ms. Shibley, what
happened here?

01:11:54.542 --> 01:11:57.125
As I said before, she was
playing with these little kids,

01:11:57.208 --> 01:12:00.167
those little kids, and I
turned around for two seconds

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:01.542
to use my phone.

01:12:01.625 --> 01:12:03.750
And I turned back
and she was gone.

01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:04.917
She was just gone.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.625
I don't-- I don't understand.

01:12:06.708 --> 01:12:08.708
Do you know any of these
kids that she's playing with?

01:12:08.792 --> 01:12:10.417
No, but they seem to know her.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.375
Did you call her parents?

01:12:11.458 --> 01:12:12.667
I did.

01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:15.042
They're coming home
from the hospital.

01:12:15.125 --> 01:12:16.667
Thank you for your time.

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:18.000
If we need any more information,
we'll give you a call.

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:20.167
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:12:23.917 --> 01:12:25.708
And you have no idea
of where our daughter is?

01:12:25.792 --> 01:12:26.958
We're doing the
best we can, sir.

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:29.667
The best you can?
The best you can?

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:30.917
Let me tell you what the
best you can would have been.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.250
You out there looking
for that woman

01:12:32.333 --> 01:12:34.042
instead of sitting
down questioning me.

01:12:34.125 --> 01:12:36.167
- Thomas.
- No, no, no.

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:37.750
This is BS.

01:12:38.208 --> 01:12:39.625
Find my daughter!

01:12:46.375 --> 01:12:47.750
- I apologize.
- No.

01:12:47.833 --> 01:12:49.083
Your family is going
through a very tough time.

01:12:49.167 --> 01:12:50.167
We understand.

01:12:57.167 --> 01:12:58.167
Brittany.

01:13:00.708 --> 01:13:01.708
Brittany!

01:13:10.542 --> 01:13:11.958
Brittany.

01:13:12.042 --> 01:13:14.958
Brittany, where are you?

01:13:15.042 --> 01:13:16.042
Brittany.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Brittany.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:21.417
Brittany!

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.875
Brittany, where are you?

01:13:26.417 --> 01:13:27.375
Oh, baby.

01:13:27.458 --> 01:13:28.833
Baby.

01:13:28.917 --> 01:13:31.250
It's okay. It's okay.
All right.

01:13:31.333 --> 01:13:32.917
All right, come here.
Come here.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:33.875
Come on, come on.

01:13:33.958 --> 01:13:35.042
I got you.

01:13:35.125 --> 01:13:36.417
I got you.

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:37.750
All right, all right.

01:13:37.833 --> 01:13:39.417
Are you hurt?

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.208
Are you hurt, baby?
Huh?

01:13:42.625 --> 01:13:44.875
Okay, okay.
Okay, all right.

01:13:44.958 --> 01:13:46.458
Okay. All right.

01:13:46.542 --> 01:13:47.542
Daddy's here.

01:13:48.667 --> 01:13:50.167
She's okay, baby.

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:52.542
Yeah, she's just
a bit shaken up.

01:13:52.625 --> 01:13:54.958
Oh, thank God.

01:13:55.042 --> 01:13:56.583
Thank God you found her.

01:13:56.667 --> 01:13:59.333
I'm bringing her home now.

01:13:59.417 --> 01:14:01.667
Listen, I'm sorry about this.

01:14:03.083 --> 01:14:04.500
Hurry, please.

01:14:04.583 --> 01:14:05.625
I'll see you soon.

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:06.708
<i>Hurry.</i>

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:28.375
Hi, young lady.

01:15:28.458 --> 01:15:29.917
- I'm detective Daly.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.125
Oh, whoa, whoa.

01:15:32.208 --> 01:15:33.333
Mr. Lewis, it
would be best if we

01:15:33.417 --> 01:15:34.333
could take Brittany
to the station

01:15:34.417 --> 01:15:35.917
tonight and get her statement.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Now, I realize this is a
traumatic experience for her,

01:15:38.083 --> 01:15:39.125
- but--
- I had enough of you guys.

01:15:39.208 --> 01:15:40.292
The only place I'm
taking my daughter

01:15:40.375 --> 01:15:42.458
is to be home with her mother.

01:15:42.542 --> 01:15:43.708
And if she's feeling
up to it tomorrow,

01:15:43.792 --> 01:15:45.417
then I'll bring her by
the police station.

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.833
She can give you a
statement then.

01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:49.500
Understood.

01:15:49.583 --> 01:15:50.583
Thank you.

01:15:56.417 --> 01:15:57.417
All right, baby.

01:15:59.458 --> 01:16:02.208
We're going home.
All right?

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:03.958
All right.

01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:11.958
You think I wanted
to be this person?

01:16:12.042 --> 01:16:14.250
You think I wanted
to be like this?

01:16:14.333 --> 01:16:15.583
Again?

01:16:15.667 --> 01:16:17.250
Do you?

01:16:17.333 --> 01:16:18.333
Answer me!

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:38.917
How's it going?

01:16:40.875 --> 01:16:43.333
Brittany.

01:16:43.417 --> 01:16:45.542
Brittany, wait, wait.

01:16:45.625 --> 01:16:46.583
Don't go in there.
Don't go in there.

01:16:46.667 --> 01:16:47.750
Why?
Why?

01:16:47.833 --> 01:16:49.167
I know women like you.

01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:54.750
Controlling, manipulative,
just like my mom.

01:16:54.833 --> 01:16:56.792
We fixed her, too.

01:16:56.875 --> 01:16:59.250
But you're a bit
more stubborn, see?

01:16:59.333 --> 01:17:01.750
You didn't die in the car.

01:17:01.833 --> 01:17:03.125
But that's okay.

01:17:05.708 --> 01:17:08.083
I have an emergency. I need you to
send the police to my address.

01:17:08.167 --> 01:17:10.125
I think there's a
officer down, all right?

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:12.250
Here. You give them your
address, all right?

01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:14.125
Go in the car.
Lock the door.

01:17:14.208 --> 01:17:15.625
Lock the door, sweetie.

01:17:17.583 --> 01:17:18.833
You're gonna drown.

01:17:25.542 --> 01:17:26.458
Megan.

01:17:30.333 --> 01:17:32.083
Your daughter is
gonna call me mom.

01:17:32.167 --> 01:17:33.958
Megan!

01:17:34.125 --> 01:17:35.458
Megan.

01:17:35.542 --> 01:17:36.583
Megan.
Tracy--

01:17:36.667 --> 01:17:37.875
Stop.
Don't come any closer.

01:17:37.958 --> 01:17:40.208
Wait, wait. Wait.
Come on.

01:17:40.292 --> 01:17:41.667
Tracy.

01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:42.917
Just please, let her go.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.208
There's still enough time.

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:45.125
The police aren't here.

01:17:45.208 --> 01:17:46.125
All right?

01:17:46.208 --> 01:17:48.250
It doesn't have to be like this.

01:17:48.333 --> 01:17:49.417
Doesn't have to be like this.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:51.417
Just-- just-- just
let her go, okay?

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.250
You don't deserve this.

01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:54.333
Neither does she.

01:17:54.417 --> 01:17:55.958
Okay?

01:17:56.042 --> 01:17:59.625
If you let her go, me and
you, we can get out of here.

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:00.667
You and me?

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:01.833
We can leave together?

01:18:02.292 --> 01:18:06.542
That's right. Just-- just let her go.
Come on. Let's go.

01:18:08.833 --> 01:18:11.708
You think I'm stupid.

01:18:11.792 --> 01:18:16.167
You, and me, and Brittany,
we can never be happy as long

01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:18.250
as she's still in the picture.

01:18:18.333 --> 01:18:19.583
She has to die.

01:18:19.667 --> 01:18:21.042
No!

01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:23.042
No, no!

01:18:23.125 --> 01:18:24.500
Freeze!

01:18:24.583 --> 01:18:26.500
Get on the ground, now!

01:18:26.583 --> 01:18:27.458
Put your hands up!

01:18:36.958 --> 01:18:39.250
So you're saying that
there were new findings?

01:18:39.333 --> 01:18:41.583
Yes, sir. For one, the woman
who attacked you two,

01:18:41.667 --> 01:18:42.792
her name isn't Tracy Jacobs.

01:18:42.875 --> 01:18:44.500
It's Laura Santiago.

01:18:44.583 --> 01:18:46.875
She got herself picked up out
of Texas for jumping bail.

01:18:46.958 --> 01:18:48.208
Apparently she's
been locked up down

01:18:48.292 --> 01:18:49.458
there since she was only 12.

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:52.875
<i>When we had given
them a call to let them know she was</i>

01:18:52.958 --> 01:18:54.750
<i>arrested, they were
more than happy to come</i>

01:18:54.833 --> 01:18:56.167
<i>down and take her back.</i>

01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:58.292
She'd only been out for
six months when she met you.

01:18:58.375 --> 01:19:00.667
What did she do to get
arrested in the first place?

01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:03.083
Well, the story that she
told you wasn't too far off.

01:19:03.167 --> 01:19:05.292
Her parents did die
in a fire, but it was

01:19:05.375 --> 01:19:07.000
she and her brother who set it.

01:19:07.083 --> 01:19:08.083
Her brother?

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:15.667
<i>She wasn't an only child.</i>

01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:18.375
<i>Remember the apartment was
under an Alfred Santiago?</i>

01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:20.167
<i>That's Laura's older brother.</i>

01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:22.542
<i>It took a lot of red tape to
get their juvenile records</i>

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:24.750
<i>because they were sealed
by the arresting state.</i>

01:19:24.833 --> 01:19:28.083
Once we got the judge to unseal
them, it cleared everything up.

01:19:28.167 --> 01:19:30.208
<i>Laura and Alfred had
both been convicted</i>

01:19:30.292 --> 01:19:31.583
<i>of killing their parents.</i>

01:19:31.667 --> 01:19:33.167
<i>But there wasn't enough
information to make</i>

01:19:33.250 --> 01:19:35.292
<i>a murder conviction stick.</i>

01:19:35.375 --> 01:19:36.875
<i>The state had offered
them a plea deal.</i>

01:19:36.958 --> 01:19:38.208
<i>Plead guilty, and
they would only</i>

01:19:38.292 --> 01:19:39.417
<i>have to go into a
mental institution</i>

01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.375
<i>until their 25th birthdays.</i>

01:19:41.458 --> 01:19:43.417
And after they were arrested,
they were both diagnosed

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.917
with histrionic personality
disorder, schizophrenia, and a

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.167
list of other mental disorders.

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:50.000
So she was never
in foster care?

01:19:50.083 --> 01:19:52.500
No. Just state facilities.

01:19:52.583 --> 01:19:54.292
<i>So where is
this brother now?</i>

01:19:54.375 --> 01:19:55.708
<i>We're still looking
for him, ma'am.</i>

01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:58.250
<i>But don't worry.
He won't get far.</i>

01:19:58.333 --> 01:20:01.375
<i>He has nowhere to go,
and no family on the outside.</i>

01:20:01.458 --> 01:20:02.583
<i>Please, trust us.</i>

01:20:02.667 --> 01:20:04.208
<i>You have nothing to worry about.</i>
