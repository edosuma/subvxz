Hello?

04:28.581 --> 04:29.923
Oh, hi.

04:30.501 --> 04:33.632
Oh, I just got in.

04:33.733 --> 04:36.000
No, I mean I literally
just stepped off the plane.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.042
I'm not even in the terminal yet.

04:38.147 --> 04:40.034
What's wrong?

04:44.067 --> 04:46.172
Fucking assholes! Where
the fuck have you been?

04:46.275 --> 04:49.210
You know, we have missed one plane,
and now we're gonna miss another one!

04:49.315 --> 04:53.504
You know, this is my ass on the line,
and if I lose my job because of you crazy... 

04:53.604 --> 04:55.872
Hey. That's 30 bucks.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.225

Come on, guys. Let's... 
What are you doing?

05:02.244 --> 05:04.098
Hello? Could we please go?

05:05.156 --> 05:07.676
<i>All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's... </i>

05:07.780 --> 05:11.075
<i>Come on, you guys. Get it
together. It's this way.</i>

05:17.571 --> 05:19.903
Okay. Okay. I'll call him.

05:20.003 --> 05:23.832
No, I promise I'll call him
just as soon as I get my luggage.

05:23.938 --> 05:26.557
Oh, no, I'm really
looking forward to it.

05:26.658 --> 05:28.546
Thank you.

Yeah, this is Corky, car number
36. Boss told me to call in.

06:06.177 --> 06:09.658
Hello. Victoria Snelling
calling for Mr. Pitt.

06:10.977 --> 06:12.865
Yes, I can wait.

06:36.737 --> 06:38.908
Hey, Ray. It's me,
Corky. I'm phoning in.

06:40.450 --> 06:42.304
Yeah, I'm out at the airport.

06:43.873 --> 06:46.621
Oh, I don't know. It's the
executive terminal or something.

06:46.721 --> 06:48.662
I don't know. I've
never been here before.

06:50.272 --> 06:52.157
No, man. Everything's cool.

06:52.257 --> 06:55.126
But listen. This car
runs like shit, man.

06:55.232 --> 06:57.883
I had to pull the plugs
myself this afternoon.

07:00.192 --> 07:03.486
Yeah, I know I'm not, but you better
tell Gonzalez to get his ass in gear... 

07:03.586 --> 07:06.334
or else I'm gonna have to
be your fucking mechanic.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.535
Larry. Larry, Victoria.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.908
Yes. I'm... 
I'm at the airport. Excuse all the noise.

07:19.008 --> 07:21.528
I'm... 
I'm at the baggage claim.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.404
Well, I... 
I, um... 

07:25.504 --> 07:30.011
I'm hoping that you have some good news
for me about that last actress I sent you.

07:30.112 --> 07:32.151
No, man. Everything's great.

07:32.255 --> 07:35.703
In fact, I got a really big tip
from these, like, musician dudes.

07:36.703 --> 07:39.638
Hey, Ray. Have you ever heard
of a band called Utensil?

07:40.767 --> 07:43.702
No, listen. I brought
back seven tapes... 

07:43.807 --> 07:47.156
of...  of the most sensational
young actresses in the country.

07:47.263 --> 07:50.230
No, not just New York. Uh, Chicago... 

07:50.335 --> 07:52.187
Minneapolis, Seattle... 

07:52.288 --> 07:54.459
San Francisco.

07:54.559 --> 07:57.691
Hey, they're all unknown. Yes.

07:57.791 --> 08:01.053
Oh, they're wonderful.
They are just so wonderful.

08:02.047 --> 08:03.047
I... 

08:03.967 --> 08:06.683
I... 
I like them all.

08:06.783 --> 08:09.271
It...
It really has to be your decision.

08:09.375 --> 08:11.228
You know, why don't I bring them by?

08:11.328 --> 08:15.417
- I'll just stop by my house for a few minutes and
then I'll come right over. - Yeah, I got you, Ray.

08:15.518 --> 08:18.169
We'll sit down, and we'll
look at 'em together, okay?

08:18.270 --> 08:21.530
- Okay. I'll get a fare here, then I'll
head back downtown. - Take it easy.

08:21.630 --> 08:24.891
- You're just gonna love one of these kids.
- Don't worry about nothin', boss.

08:24.991 --> 08:27.924
Relax, okay? See you in a few.

08:28.030 --> 08:30.395
Hey, Ray. I'm not a kid, okay?

08:30.495 --> 08:31.495
Yeah.

08:32.926 --> 08:33.926
Shit.

08:37.854 --> 08:39.796
Hey, you need a cab, lady?

08:41.246 --> 08:43.668
- Yeah, I guess I do.
- Yeah, I'm right here.

08:45.662 --> 08:47.995
- You're a taxi driver?
- Yeah.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.587
Okay. I, uh... 

08:50.750 --> 08:52.638
Yeah. Why not?

a little in love with my luggage.

09:21.822 --> 09:23.709
No problem, lady.

09:30.301 --> 09:32.211
Ah, ah! I'll carry
that with me. Thank you.

09:32.317 --> 09:33.318
Okay.

09:36.413 --> 09:38.300
Thank you.

09:40.252 --> 09:42.074
Let me get... 

09:42.174 --> 09:43.993
- I need that leg.
- Sorry.

09:44.093 --> 09:46.002
- Just take it.
- Sorry.

09:46.108 --> 09:47.929
- Yeah.
- You in?

09:48.029 --> 09:50.068
Yes. Thank you.

<i>The white zone is for immediate

Uh, 6754.

6549.

10:52.603 --> 10:53.603
Damn!

10:54.587 --> 10:56.408
What's the matter?

10:56.508 --> 11:00.280
Oh, I left my phone book back in the
suitcase with all my numbers in it.

11:00.380 --> 11:02.680
- I'm afraid we'll have to
pull over...  Is it listed?

11:02.780 --> 11:06.871
- Listed? - Yes, it's a...  it's
a hotel I've called a million... 

11:09.402 --> 11:11.222
Why, thank you. Thank you.

11:11.322 --> 11:14.867
No problem. Just pass it
back up when you're done.

11:14.970 --> 11:17.335
Are you okay without it up there?

11:17.435 --> 11:19.321
Don't worry about it.

11:36.538 --> 11:38.360
Suite 216, please.

11:40.986 --> 11:42.807
Carol. Victoria.

11:44.026 --> 11:47.408
Yes. I, uh...
I just spoke to him.

11:48.409 --> 11:51.792
Oh, he's going nuts as usual.
Ricocheting off the walls.

11:51.897 --> 11:53.937
I don't know what to
do with him anymore.

11:54.042 --> 11:58.034
I sent him 10 actresses
who were perf...  Well... 

11:58.137 --> 12:00.112
six of them were perfect.

12:00.217 --> 12:02.770
But he just keeps...
he keeps wanting them younger and younger.

12:02.873 --> 12:06.767
Now he wants someone 18 with
absolutely no experience... 

12:06.873 --> 12:08.880
but the nerves of a paratrooper.

12:08.985 --> 12:12.530
He's not human. I think he's an android.

12:12.633 --> 12:14.433
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:14.557 --> 12:17.236
<i>Listen. I'm gonna have to go
over there with those tapes..</i>

12:17.337 --> 12:20.436
<i>I brought back from, uh... 
~ Gonna have a fine vacation ~</i>

12:20.537 --> 12:23.058
Carol, I...  I,
uh...  I'm going... 

12:23.161 --> 12:26.062
I...  I'm supposed to have dinner
with Peter and Shera tonight.

12:26.169 --> 12:28.405
<i>- But... ~ I've got to take my
problems to the United Nations ~</i>

12:28.505 --> 12:32.018
Will you hold on a second, please? Miss.

12:32.121 --> 12:35.187
<i>- ~ I done called my congressman ~
- Would you please, uh... </i>

12:35.289 --> 12:37.744
just turn the music off?

12:38.808 --> 12:40.629
<i>Sure, mom.</i>

12:40.729 --> 12:42.646
Thank you.

12:43.127 --> 12:45.069
This is my day.

12:45.176 --> 12:47.565
Okay. Where were we?

12:47.670 --> 12:51.054
Oh, yes. W... Will you call them and
explain and tell them why I can't?

12:51.159 --> 12:52.310
Great.

12:52.664 --> 12:55.086
Listen. Were there any messages for me?

12:56.088 --> 12:57.431
Uh... huh.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.462
Uh... huh.

13:04.888 --> 13:06.422
Carol... 

13:08.216 --> 13:10.387
did Mr. Kincade call?

13:12.728 --> 13:15.029
You're sure?

13:15.129 --> 13:16.129
Okay.

13:18.039 --> 13:19.039
Okay.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.539
Okay then. I will, um... 

13:23.639 --> 13:25.524
I'll...
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

13:25.624 --> 13:27.662
Great. Bye-bye.

13:50.678 --> 13:53.166
<i>Is Mr. Kincade, like, your boyfriend?</i>

13:55.799 --> 13:57.686
Yes, he is.

13:59.222 --> 14:01.110
At least I think he is.

14:03.255 --> 14:05.644
Guys...
Can't live with 'em, can't shoot 'em.

14:09.366 --> 14:11.308
Yeah. You can say that again.

14:12.757 --> 14:15.627
Oh, your phone book. Here. Thanks a lot.

14:16.694 --> 14:17.694
Sure.

14:48.662 --> 14:51.923
Boy, it sure gets dark fast
in the winter, doesn't it?

14:53.492 --> 14:56.273
<i>Driving at night doesn't
seem to bother you.</i>

14:56.373 --> 14:58.193
<i>Why should it?</i>

14:58.293 --> 15:01.107
<i>Oh, with me it's a big
problem. I have night blindness.</i>

15:02.197 --> 15:04.914
Is that, like, something
that happens when you get old?

15:07.093 --> 15:10.671
No. No. Actually, it isn't. Uh... 

15:10.772 --> 15:14.121
It has nothing to do with
age. I've had it all my life.

15:22.580 --> 15:26.256
Fuckin'... A, man. That's fucked.

15:58.259 --> 16:00.147
Oh, thank you.

16:04.084 --> 16:05.971
Thank you.

16:11.251 --> 16:14.863
You know, it really isn't any of
my business, but you smoke too much.

16:16.276 --> 16:18.162
Okay, mom.

16:21.075 --> 16:23.311
You're really happy driving
this taxi, aren't you?

16:23.411 --> 16:25.137
Fuck yes.

16:25.394 --> 16:28.972
I mean, yeah. It's a cool job.

16:31.057 --> 16:33.872
But, I mean, is that
your whole goal in life?

16:33.972 --> 16:36.816
Driving taxicabs?

16:36.916 --> 16:38.889
Is there somethin' wrong with that?

16:38.994 --> 16:41.809
No, no, no. I'm
sorry. I...  I... 

16:42.803 --> 16:45.551
I really didn't mean
that the way it sounded.

16:57.299 --> 16:59.241
Yeah, well, I'll tell you somethin'.

16:59.346 --> 17:01.550
I don't always want to be a cabdriver.

17:03.154 --> 17:06.569
- What do you really want to be?
- A mechanic.

17:06.673 --> 17:08.746
A mechanic?

17:08.848 --> 17:11.117
I practically know all
there is to know about it.

17:11.217 --> 17:13.038
Both my brothers are mechanics.

17:13.137 --> 17:16.454
They're older than me, but, you know,
'cause I'm, like, a girl, and I'm, like... 

17:16.561 --> 17:20.457
still kind of young and all, I gotta
kind of, like, work up to it, you know.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.790
<i>What about
marriage and a family?</i>

17:23.890 --> 17:26.606
<i>Definitely.
Definitely want a family.</i>

17:26.705 --> 17:29.226
<i>Boys though. Lots of boys.</i>

17:29.330 --> 17:32.169
<i>No girls?</i>

17:32.269 --> 17:33.997
Girls are nice too, I think.

17:34.097 --> 17:37.480
Yeah. Maybe some girls too.

17:37.585 --> 17:40.399
But, you know, like, that stuff...
that's all beside the point.

17:40.499 --> 17:43.432
The real problem is to find
a good guy for the father.

17:43.538 --> 17:45.871
Tell me about it.

17:49.393 --> 17:52.360
Well, I'm real particular, you know.

17:52.465 --> 17:56.718
And I'm also patient enough.
I mean, at least I hope I am.

17:56.818 --> 18:00.875
'Cause, you know...  I don't know...  maybe
you gotta wait a while, you know... 

18:00.976 --> 18:05.286
'cause, like, maybe it's not so easy to
find, like, the exact right guy, you know.

18:05.392 --> 18:07.596
Like, the one guy, you know?

18:08.593 --> 18:09.593
No.

18:10.513 --> 18:14.058
- Another mechanic maybe.
- Hell, I don't care what he does.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.844
As long as he loves me right.

18:16.944 --> 18:19.244
With his soul.

18:19.345 --> 18:21.581
You know, takes me for who I am.

18:26.352 --> 18:28.240
I know what you mean.

18:30.191 --> 18:32.556
Like Popeye says, "I am what I am."

18:32.656 --> 18:33.806
Right?

18:34.575 --> 18:36.462
Yes. You certainly are.

19:22.415 --> 19:24.782
Hello? Oh, hi, Marty.

19:25.774 --> 19:27.595
Yes. I talked to him.

19:27.695 --> 19:31.011
<i>Of course I know what he wants.
I've heard it a hundred times.</i>

19:32.623 --> 19:34.695
Oh, Marty. Go ahead. Just tell me again.

19:38.509 --> 19:41.325
Try driving school, you fucking nimrod!

19:50.222 --> 19:51.757
Marty... 

19:53.102 --> 19:57.542
I may be having a brilliant
streak right here in the taxi.

19:57.645 --> 20:00.906
Yes, I'm really in a taxi.

20:01.006 --> 20:03.013
No, I can't tell you right now.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.077
Um... 

20:05.997 --> 20:07.939
all I can say is... 

20:08.046 --> 20:09.933
I have an idea.

20:11.149 --> 20:15.175
No. That's why I don't
tell you things, Marty.

20:16.878 --> 20:20.674
I'm sorry I sound calm. I
assure you I'm hysterical.

20:20.781 --> 20:23.236
I'll call you the
minute I know anything.

20:24.237 --> 20:26.092
Good-bye, Mar... 
Good-bye, Marty.

20:27.373 --> 20:29.740
<i>All right. This is Beverly
Drive coming up. Where to?</i>

20:30.797 --> 20:34.627
Uh, just turn right on Beverly Court... 

20:34.733 --> 20:37.733
then follow the hill up
to Beverly Circle, please.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.180
Got ya.

20:49.773 --> 20:52.162
<i>It's up on the left. 971.</i>

21:54.027 --> 21:56.929
- Want me to take these in the house
for you? - No. Uh, that's okay.

21:57.035 --> 22:00.897
- Just put 'em over there, please.
- No, I got it. It's my job.

22:10.826 --> 22:11.826
No... 

22:21.227 --> 22:23.812
Okay, that'll be, um, 33 bucks, please.

22:23.914 --> 22:27.230
Okay. Uh, no. Keep the...
Keep the change.

22:27.339 --> 22:29.957
Listen...
Thanks.

22:30.058 --> 22:31.944
Can I ask you something?

22:32.044 --> 22:35.010
Now, this is gonna sound a
little crazy to you, but, uh... 

22:36.170 --> 22:38.210
Well, I'm a casting agent.

22:38.314 --> 22:40.703
That means that I go
out and I find people.

22:40.810 --> 22:43.363
You know, for really big movies.

22:44.362 --> 22:47.843
And I've been observing you.

22:47.946 --> 22:51.045
And I...  I honestly think
you have something special.

22:51.146 --> 22:55.585
As a matter of fact, I'm casting a part right...
right now that I think you'd be perfect for.

22:55.689 --> 22:57.827
This is a...
a terrific part.

22:58.825 --> 23:00.646
You could be a movie star.

23:00.746 --> 23:03.876
- What, like right now?
- Well, yeah.

23:05.673 --> 23:07.647
I really wouldn't want
to do that, you know.

23:07.753 --> 23:11.234
I mean, I have a job. I really wouldn't
want to lose this job, you know.

23:11.337 --> 23:13.792
I really wouldn't want to fuck
things up right now, you know.

23:13.897 --> 23:15.750
You understand, right?

23:15.850 --> 23:17.191
Well... 

23:17.769 --> 23:19.591
let's not be hasty.

23:20.585 --> 23:23.487
Um, I'm...  I'm...  I'm serious
about this, you know.

23:24.553 --> 23:27.717
I just want to be sure you
understand what I'm offering you.

23:27.818 --> 23:30.533
Yeah, but, you know, I'm a cabdriver.

23:30.633 --> 23:32.454
You know, this is what I do.

23:32.554 --> 23:34.920
Like I told you, I'm
gonna be a mechanic.

23:37.832 --> 23:41.280
I don't want to press
you. I really don't. Um... 

23:41.384 --> 23:45.377
But I just want to make
sure that I understand.

23:45.480 --> 23:48.644
Are you saying that you... 

23:48.744 --> 23:52.005
you just wouldn't be interested
in being a movie star?

23:53.000 --> 23:56.774
- Nah.
- Hey, you could be a mechanic later.

23:56.874 --> 23:59.775
Everyone wants to be a movie star.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.173
Look, lady. You know, I
like the movies and all.

24:03.273 --> 24:06.533
And... And I see you're
being serious, you know.

24:06.633 --> 24:09.763
But that's not a real
life for me. You know?

24:09.864 --> 24:13.955
I mean, I'm sure there's tons of girls
who wanna be in the movies and all... 

24:14.056 --> 24:16.227
and, you know, I... 

24:16.328 --> 24:19.011
I'm not saying it right.

24:19.112 --> 24:22.787
It's just that I have everything
planned out for me, you know?

24:22.887 --> 24:25.408
I mean, everything's going
just right for me now.

24:30.087 --> 24:32.159
Well, you can't beat that, can you?

24:33.223 --> 24:34.224
Nope.

24:36.615 --> 24:39.037
But, you know,
I mean, I appreciate it.

24:44.903 --> 24:47.008
- Thanks for the tip.
- You bet.

24:48.454 --> 24:50.790
- Take it easy.
- Sure, mom.

25:29.670 --> 25:33.471
<i>Oh, shut up.</i>

26:50.980 --> 26:53.090
Taxi! Yeah.

26:53.252 --> 26:55.838
Yo, yo, yo, yo, taxi! Shit.

26:55.940 --> 26:58.239
Gotta get a taxi, man.

26:58.340 --> 27:00.860
Here we go. Taxi!

27:00.964 --> 27:03.833
Taxi! Yo, man. Right here.

27:03.940 --> 27:06.045
Right here. Whoo! Right.

27:06.148 --> 27:08.002
This is the ticket. Yo, what's up?

27:11.268 --> 27:12.994
Brooklyn.

27:13.508 --> 27:16.857
Brooklyn, man. Yo!
Yo, man! You suck, man!

27:16.964 --> 27:19.775
<i>I got your plate number!
I'm gonna call the T.L.C.I</i>

27:19.875 --> 27:22.176
<i>Come on, man. Somebody pick me up.</i>

27:22.276 --> 27:24.860
Yeah. Come on. Pick me up. What's... 

27:25.923 --> 27:27.745
<i>There's a million fuckin' cabs out here.</i>

27:29.379 --> 27:31.232
Cash, man.

27:31.332 --> 27:33.949
Yeah. That's the ticket.
This is gonna get me home.

27:34.051 --> 27:37.051
Shit. It's gonna get my ass home, man.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.676
I got cash, man!

27:39.779 --> 27:42.975
Taxi. Look. I got the cash right here.

27:43.075 --> 27:44.896
Taxi. Come on, man.

27:44.996 --> 27:47.003
Come on, man!
What... What... 

27:47.107 --> 27:49.693
<i>Fuck all y'all!</i>

27:51.075 --> 27:54.173
No, you ain't gettin'... You ain't takin'
my cab now. You ain't takin' my cab.

27:54.275 --> 27:56.250
That's right. Just keep
walkin'. Yeah. That's right.

27:57.347 --> 28:01.339
Shit. They know you desperate. That's
all it is. What am I, invisible, man?

28:01.442 --> 28:05.217
I don't give a fuck. Get me a
taxi. Have my name on it too.

28:15.042 --> 28:16.635
You go to Brooklyn?

28:17.922 --> 28:19.962
Hello. How are you?

28:21.858 --> 28:23.743
I wanna go to Brooklyn.

28:23.843 --> 28:26.460
Uh, come in, sir.

28:26.562 --> 28:27.562
All right.

28:30.273 --> 28:33.054
- You know how to get to Brooklyn?
- "Brookland"?

28:33.154 --> 28:35.772
Uh, better you show me.

28:37.506 --> 28:39.774
Yeah. All right. Look.

28:39.874 --> 28:43.321
Phew. Go straight down Broadway,
and then I'll explain as we go.

28:49.089 --> 28:51.423
Hey, what's up?

28:52.641 --> 28:56.056
What? You new at this? You...
You got...  You got it in park.

28:56.161 --> 28:59.421
<i>Hey, man. You gotta put it in drive.</i>

28:59.521 --> 29:00.521
"D."

29:02.081 --> 29:03.966
"D"! "D" is to drive.

29:04.066 --> 29:07.807
- Put the motherfucker in drive!
- Yeah, yeah. "D" is to drive.

29:09.185 --> 29:10.185
So... 

29:11.137 --> 29:12.137
Okay.

29:18.785 --> 29:21.916
Hey, what's... What you
doin', man? Hey, what...  Hey!

29:25.857 --> 29:26.857
Hey.

29:27.841 --> 29:31.036
- Hey, man. What's wrong with the car? Hey.
- It's automatic.

29:31.136 --> 29:33.045
Hey. No, no, man. It ain't automatic.

29:33.152 --> 29:36.632
<i>Yo. Yo, man. What's wrong with... 
Hey, look. What's...  What's up, man?</i>

29:36.736 --> 29:39.069
- It's automatic.
- Pull over, man!

29:39.169 --> 29:42.135
Just pull the fuck over! Yeah.
Pull over right here, man.

29:45.536 --> 29:46.536
Shit.

29:48.672 --> 29:49.672
What?

29:50.592 --> 29:54.333
Hey, man. I don't think this shit's gonna
work out, man. I'm gonna get me another cab.

29:54.433 --> 29:56.571
Oh, no, no. Please. Please.

29:56.671 --> 30:01.275
You are... You are my... 
my most best customer.

30:01.375 --> 30:03.994
No, man. Look, you ain't takin' me
to Brooklyn. You can't even drive!

30:04.095 --> 30:07.836
But you want taxi.
I am a taxi. I am here. Taxi.

30:07.936 --> 30:12.278
I know you are a taxi. But
I'm gonna get me another taxi.

30:12.383 --> 30:15.196
But no. No. Uh... 

30:15.296 --> 30:17.913
It's important. It's
very, very important to me.

30:18.015 --> 30:19.166
We go.

30:21.183 --> 30:22.183
Man.

30:24.319 --> 30:25.319
Yeah.

30:26.495 --> 30:28.347
All right. All right.

30:28.447 --> 30:31.480
<i>I'll go to Brooklyn, all
right? We will go to Brooklyn.</i>

30:31.582 --> 30:33.403
But you let me drive.

30:33.503 --> 30:37.081
<i>See, I drive and you ride.</i>

30:37.183 --> 30:39.484
I'll pay the fare and all that.

30:39.584 --> 30:42.986
<i>But I drive.</i>

30:43.086 --> 30:44.283
No. No. It's... 

30:44.383 --> 30:48.277
<i>- What do you mean, no?
- It's not allowed. Not allowed.</i>

30:48.383 --> 30:51.798
Look. Yeah, it's
allowed. This is New York.

30:51.963 --> 30:54.837
New...  Okay.

30:55.134 --> 30:56.134
Good.

30:57.118 --> 30:59.451
New York. New York.

30:59.551 --> 31:01.276
New York.

31:01.534 --> 31:03.836
Big trouble.

31:04.190 --> 31:06.099
Big trouble.

31:06.206 --> 31:08.987
In big fucking trouble.

31:09.087 --> 31:10.907
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

31:11.007 --> 31:13.427
- Do you understand what I
am...  what I am saying? - Yeah.

31:13.534 --> 31:16.087
Please drive careful.

31:16.190 --> 31:18.971
Uh, drive...
drive careful.

31:19.071 --> 31:21.241
- Yo, man. I know how to
drive. - No...  No accident.

31:21.342 --> 31:23.481
- No accident. Get in.
- No accident.

31:26.270 --> 31:28.725
But don't tell. Don't tell.

31:28.829 --> 31:32.855
Who am I gonna tell, man? Look... 

31:32.958 --> 31:36.186
- Look, man. Just relax, all right?
- Job. Go.

31:36.286 --> 31:39.930
Just wait a minute, all right? Look at
this. You didn't even turn the meter on.

31:40.030 --> 31:42.484
First thing you gotta do is
turn that fuckin' meter on.

31:43.580 --> 31:47.289
See, it turns the light off on
top. That means you're occupied.

31:47.389 --> 31:51.699
I am... Yes, I am oc... 
occupied. Occupied. Yes. There.

31:51.805 --> 31:54.009
Then you gotta put it in "D." You see?

31:54.109 --> 31:57.043
I...  I know that.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.734
Hey, don't be saying nothing
bad, man. I understand that shit.

31:59.837 --> 32:01.942
<i>- Put it in "D." "D" is for drive.
- Ja.</i>

32:02.045 --> 32:04.085
Just... Just chill out, all right?

32:04.189 --> 32:06.011
Damn, man!

32:21.628 --> 32:23.516
It's nice.

32:26.044 --> 32:28.978
<i>It's New York. It's cool.</i>

32:29.084 --> 32:31.735
<i>Ja. It's cold. It's cool.</i>

32:31.835 --> 32:35.576
<i>Nah, nah, nah. You know,
it's hip. It's cool. It's happening.</i>

32:35.676 --> 32:39.570
<i>Ah, I understand.
"It's cool' is good.</i>

32:39.675 --> 32:42.275
<i>Right.</i>

32:49.404 --> 32:51.706
Goes good. Goes good.

32:53.211 --> 32:55.284
Yeah. Yeah. Goes good.

32:55.387 --> 32:57.940
In English we say, "It's good to go."

32:58.044 --> 33:00.248
- It's good to go.
- Yeah.

33:00.348 --> 33:02.681
It's good to go. That's good.

33:02.781 --> 33:05.267
It's good to go. It's good.

33:05.372 --> 33:08.405
- Good to go.
- Yeah. Yeah, man. Just chill, all right?

33:09.563 --> 33:13.075
We have the same...
We have the same hat.

33:13.178 --> 33:14.999
- What?
- The same hat.

33:15.099 --> 33:18.871
- No. No, no. Mine's different.
- Oh, no. It's the same hat.

33:18.971 --> 33:21.556
- Mine's different, man.
- This is different here. This...

33:21.658 --> 33:24.309
Mine's... Mine's the newest, latest. Mine's fresh.

33:24.411 --> 33:27.094
No. The ear things here. The same.

33:27.195 --> 33:30.294
- Ear. This...  No, man.
Look, mine is the... the hype.

33:30.394 --> 33:32.215
- What is this? Hype?
- The hype.

33:32.315 --> 33:34.224
- What's a hype?
- It's fresh.

33:34.330 --> 33:37.144
- Fresh. Fresh hat.
- It's the jammy. The newest, latest.

33:37.244 --> 33:39.828
Fresh hat. It sounds good.

33:39.931 --> 33:42.102
- Fresh hat.
- Right.

33:49.275 --> 33:51.478
<i>So where you from anyway?</i>

33:51.578 --> 33:54.033
<i>From, uh, Germany.
Eastern Germany.</i>

33:54.137 --> 33:56.690
- Eastern Germany?
- Yeah.

33:56.794 --> 34:00.372
From the city of Dresden, which
is close to Czechoslovakia. Uh...

34:00.474 --> 34:02.579
Close to what?

34:02.681 --> 34:04.885
Czechoslovakia.

34:04.986 --> 34:06.328
Prague.

34:07.002 --> 34:09.685
- Main town. Prague.
- Hmm.

34:09.786 --> 34:12.655
Huh. What, you... you escape from there?

34:12.762 --> 34:14.649
No, no. I was free to go.

34:16.090 --> 34:17.974
You got a family over there?

34:18.074 --> 34:20.114
I have no family.

34:25.658 --> 34:27.384
So, uh... 

34:27.610 --> 34:29.846
what'd you do over there
before you came over here... 

34:29.946 --> 34:31.831
'cause I know you sure
didn't drive no cab!

34:31.931 --> 34:33.871
I was a circus clown.

34:33.978 --> 34:35.504
Get the fuck outta here.

34:35.610 --> 34:38.958
No, no, no. I...
Wait. I'll show you.

34:39.063 --> 34:40.065
Here.

34:53.112 --> 34:54.839
Oh, shit.

34:55.128 --> 34:57.517
That's some bugged-out shit, man.

35:05.688 --> 35:07.924
What's your name, man?

35:08.024 --> 35:12.083
Helmut Grokenberger. Here.
There. You can read it. That's me.

35:12.185 --> 35:13.527
Helmet?

35:13.849 --> 35:15.191
Helmut.

35:17.368 --> 35:19.376
- That's your name?
- Yeah.

35:20.920 --> 35:23.854
That's a fucked-up name to
be naming your kid. Helmet.

35:24.856 --> 35:28.149
See, 'cause in English,
a helmet would be, like...

35:28.249 --> 35:30.669
you know, like something you
wear on your head, you know?

35:30.776 --> 35:32.630
You know. A... A helmet.

35:34.872 --> 35:38.188
In English, that'd be
like calling your kid, uh...

35:38.296 --> 35:40.148
Oh, shit. Uh... 

35:40.248 --> 35:42.189
"Lampshade." Some shit like that.

35:42.296 --> 35:44.022
No, but... 

35:44.247 --> 35:47.957
"Hey, Lampshade! Come here
and clean up your room!"

35:50.328 --> 35:52.400
So, what's your name?

It's a toy for ki... Yo Yo.

What the fuck is she doin' out here?

37:02.773 --> 37:05.392
<i>- Goddamn it!

37:05.493 --> 37:07.893
<i>Damn.</i>

<i>There she goes again, man.
Fuckin' up again as usual.</i>

<i>What has happened?</i>

37:16.502 --> 37:18.903
<i>Shit.</i>

37:20.022 --> 37:21.931
Just be cool, Helmet.
I'll be right back.

37:23.094 --> 37:25.614
<i>Angela! Angela!</i>

37:25.718 --> 37:28.784
Where the fuck are you goin', man?
Where you goin'? What are you doin'?

37:31.734 --> 37:33.968
What are you doing,
Yo Yo? Get the fuck off me!

37:34.068 --> 37:37.035
- Hey, don't be grabbing my clothes, man!
- Then get the fuck off me, man!

37:37.141 --> 37:39.474
Ain't nobody on the street. Where

37:39.574 --> 37:42.475
- What are you so concerned about what
the fuck am I doing? - I'm concerned!

37:42.580 --> 37:44.719
- Why you so fuckin' stupid?
- Party here. Party there. Always partyin'.

37:44.821 --> 37:47.121
- It's none of your fuckin' business.
- It is my business. I'm family.

37:47.221 --> 37:49.521
<i>- You're not my family!
- You're supposed to be home with your husband.</i>

37:49.621 --> 37:52.816
- He knows where I'm at!
- I doubt if he knows where you're at.

37:52.916 --> 37:54.923
- He's... 
- Don't be touchin' me no more.

37:55.029 --> 37:58.509
- I'm not touchin' you. Angela, listen
to me. All right? - What? What?

38:00.085 --> 38:03.249
What's up with you? It's a
family thing, all right? Step off.

38:04.244 --> 38:06.065
- Angela, come on.
- Oh, man.

38:06.165 --> 38:08.496
No, man. I don't... What

38:08.596 --> 38:11.280
<i>- Don't be hittin' on me.

38:11.380 --> 38:13.388
<i>Get in the car, Angela.</i>

38:13.492 --> 38:16.719
- Get in the fuckin' car. Come on.
- Who the fuck are you...  Get off!

38:16.819 --> 38:18.794
Get the fuck off of me, man!

38:18.899 --> 38:21.899
- Get the fuck off of me!
- Get in the car. Get in the car.

38:22.003 --> 38:24.304
Angela, just calm down. Just calm down.

38:24.404 --> 38:27.631
- Get the fuck off of me!
- Get in the car. Angela, get in the car.

38:27.731 --> 38:29.706
Don't make me have to hurt you.

38:29.811 --> 38:32.331
Don't be kickin' me. Don't be kickin'.

38:32.435 --> 38:34.256
- Shit.
- What the fuck are you doin'?

38:34.356 --> 38:36.656
What you doin'?

38:36.756 --> 38:38.697
Let me out of this car!

38:38.803 --> 38:40.843
What the fuck is your problem, man?

38:40.947 --> 38:43.915
- What the fuck is your fuckin'
problem, man? - You're my problem!

38:44.019 --> 38:46.637
- No, you're my fuckin' problem.
- Angela, don't be cursin' me out.

38:46.739 --> 38:50.798
- Well, fuck you, fuck you and fuck you!
- Look, Angela. Just shut up!

38:50.899 --> 38:52.874
No, you shut up. Don't
be telling me to shut up.

38:52.980 --> 38:53.954
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

38:54.054 --> 38:56.850
- No, you shut up!
- Shit.

39:00.115 --> 39:02.056
You know what your
fuckin' problem is, Yo Yo?

39:02.162 --> 39:04.748
You don't realize that you're
wearing your ass on your head.

39:07.378 --> 39:09.834
Oh, hey, don't worry, Helmet,
man. It's just a family thing.

39:09.938 --> 39:12.043
- You're not my fuckin' family.
- Look, I am your family.

39:12.146 --> 39:14.479
- You ain't shit to me. - I'm
your brother-in-law, all right?

39:14.579 --> 39:17.961
- Angela, just calm down!
- Don't tell me to calm down!

39:18.066 --> 39:20.748
She's really beautiful. She's beautiful.

39:21.810 --> 39:24.232
- Yeah, you think so, huh?
- Yes.

39:24.338 --> 39:26.280
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

39:30.258 --> 39:32.331
- What's your name?
- Helmet.

39:32.434 --> 39:35.566
- His name is Helmet Lampshade or some
shit like that. - Oh, fuck you, all right?

39:35.666 --> 39:39.049
- Don't fuck with me.
- No, no. My name is Helmut Grokenberger.

39:39.154 --> 39:42.381
Here. You can read it.
Helmut Grokenberger.

39:42.482 --> 39:43.633
Great.

39:44.433 --> 39:47.433
I'm driving with a fuckin'
idiot and some clown.

39:47.537 --> 39:49.479
Oh, yes. I am a clown.

39:49.584 --> 39:51.853
Yeah, Angela. It's true.

39:51.953 --> 39:53.774
- Shut up!
- No, it's true. Check it out.

39:53.874 --> 39:55.913
- Shut up.
- Hey. Come on, Helmet. Show her.

39:56.017 --> 39:58.701
- Do that horn thing you did, man.
- Ah, yes.

40:07.089 --> 40:08.089
Yes.

40:09.649 --> 40:12.104
That shit is so bugged, man!

40:12.210 --> 40:14.282
What the hell are you doing?

40:15.921 --> 40:19.750
- Thank you.
- See, what'd I tell you, Angela?

41:02.352 --> 41:04.239
Helmet, man. Forget about her.

41:05.872 --> 41:08.293
Check it out, man. Brooklyn
Bridge. Right over there.

41:08.400 --> 41:10.221
Oh, that's... 

41:10.321 --> 41:13.799
<i>That's
- That's beautiful.</i>

41:18.063 --> 41:19.950
All the lights.

41:31.919 --> 41:32.919
Oh!

41:35.439 --> 41:36.439
Like.

41:44.751 --> 41:46.638
You got it, man.

41:49.967 --> 41:52.268
- I'm the driver.
- Yeah.

41:52.368 --> 41:54.254
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

41:55.919 --> 41:59.017
Is somebody gonna tell me what
the fuck is goin' on around here?

41:59.118 --> 42:00.939
- What you mean?
- What do I mean?

42:01.039 --> 42:03.657
What the fuck are you driving
this cab for, Yo Yo, huh?

42:03.758 --> 42:05.831
And what's up with the fuckin' hats?

42:05.934 --> 42:08.170
What is this, the fuckin'
Rocky and Bullwinkle show?

42:08.270 --> 42:11.466
Yes, yes. We... We have
the same hats. Both.

42:11.566 --> 42:13.573
Look. Just forget about
the hats. All right?

42:13.677 --> 42:17.606
Look. It was Helmet's first day drivin'. He
drive like shit. All right? So I took over.

42:17.710 --> 42:20.198
- Oh, you took over.
- Yeah.

42:20.302 --> 42:23.880
You know, you're a fuckin' typical
control freak. You know that?

42:23.982 --> 42:26.087
- Man! Shit.
- Look. Angela, just shut up, all right?

42:26.190 --> 42:28.678
Don't tell me to shut up. I
already told you about that shit.

42:28.782 --> 42:30.538
- I'm telling you to shut up.
- You shut up!

42:30.638 --> 42:31.783
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

42:31.886 --> 42:33.991
- Shut the fuck up!
- You shut the fuck up, all right?

42:34.094 --> 42:35.094
Damn.

42:37.006 --> 42:39.494
You're a fuckin' idiot,
Yo Yo. You know that?

42:39.598 --> 42:42.442
Yo, you see the sign? It says,
"Sit back in case of short stops."

42:42.542 --> 42:44.394
You never know. I might stop real short.

42:44.494 --> 42:48.290
You better be careful, because if I get
hurt, I'm gonna kick your fuckin' ass.

42:48.397 --> 42:50.339
- Always got to have the last word, right?
- That's right.

42:50.445 --> 42:51.439
<i>- Right.
- That's right.</i>

42:51.539 --> 42:53.475
<i>- Right.
- Right.</i>

42:53.581 --> 42:54.581
Damn!

42:56.045 --> 42:57.866
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Say somethin'. Go ahead.

42:57.966 --> 43:01.031
If you fuckin' stop talkin' to me, then
you won't have to hear my fuckin' mouth.

43:01.133 --> 43:05.224
So why don't you shut the fuck up and then I won't
have to be talkin' all the time, you stupid idiot.

43:05.325 --> 43:08.008
- Right.
- Oh, fuck you.

43:08.109 --> 43:10.018
Angela, fuck you too.
You know what you like?

43:10.125 --> 43:12.710
You're like a fuckin' Chihuahua,
always gnawing at my fuckin' ankles.

43:12.813 --> 43:16.293
Yeah? Well, I'm gonna take a big fuckin'
bite out of your fuckin' ass then... 

43:16.397 --> 43:18.818
so you better watch
out for this little dog.

43:18.925 --> 43:21.510
- Shit.
- Damn.

43:21.613 --> 43:24.263
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck.

43:26.156 --> 43:29.255
- Nice family. Nice family.
- 'Cause he's an asshole. That's why.

43:29.356 --> 43:31.177
- Yeah. Right.
- Huh?

43:31.277 --> 43:33.099
Asshole. He's an asshole.

43:35.404 --> 43:36.939
Asshole.

43:50.124 --> 43:52.840
<i>Check it out, Helmet. This is Brooklyn.</i>

43:52.940 --> 43:54.761
What you think, man?

43:54.861 --> 43:56.747
Uh, it's great.

43:58.380 --> 44:00.322
It's a dump.

44:00.428 --> 44:03.363
Don't be sayin' shit like that,
Angela. It's our neighborhood.

44:03.467 --> 44:05.540
Like I give a shit?

44:07.788 --> 44:10.056
It's "Brookland."

44:37.451 --> 44:39.873
You see, Helmet? This is where we live.

44:40.906 --> 44:43.525
- Thanks for nothin', asshole.
- Don't be hittin' on me, Angela.

44:43.627 --> 44:46.148
- Oh, shut up.
- No, you shut up.

44:48.938 --> 44:51.655
Good-bye to you, Angela.

44:53.130 --> 44:55.016
Good-bye to you
too, Helmet-head.

44:55.116 --> 44:56.840
Good-bye.

44:58.346 --> 45:00.167
<i>- Hey, Yo Yo.
- What?</i>

45:00.267 --> 45:01.992
Fuck you!

45:10.634 --> 45:13.481
- Take this.
- Oh, yes.

45:16.842 --> 45:20.965
Hey. You should count that shit.
You should always count that shit.

45:23.562 --> 45:25.562
<i>Ja.</i>

45:31.689 --> 45:33.224
You see?

45:34.154 --> 45:36.154
<i>Ja.</i>

45:36.361 --> 45:38.246
It's a little less.

45:38.346 --> 45:40.898
The meter say 13. I only gave you 12.

45:41.001 --> 45:42.001
Yes.

45:46.953 --> 45:48.960
It's New York, Helmet.

45:49.064 --> 45:51.934
<i>Money is... Ja. Money... </i>

45:53.256 --> 45:55.077
is not important for me.

45:55.177 --> 45:57.086
I am a clown.
I... I need it.

45:57.192 --> 46:00.837
It's not important...  for me.

46:00.937 --> 46:02.944
Yeah. Yeah.

46:10.792 --> 46:13.029
So, you know how to get
back to Manhattan, Helmet?

46:13.129 --> 46:14.663
Uh, we... 

46:16.361 --> 46:18.979
- No. No.
- Shit.

46:20.391 --> 46:25.694
All right. You're gonna make the opposite
of every direction we made to get here.

46:25.799 --> 46:29.443
So if...  if we made a right, then this
time you're gonna make a left.

46:29.543 --> 46:31.909
And if we made a left,
you're gonna make a right.

46:32.009 --> 46:34.789
- Right?
- Ah, yeah. Two rights.

46:34.889 --> 46:37.277
No, no, no, no, no, no.

46:37.384 --> 46:39.205
Helmet, look.

46:39.305 --> 46:42.719
You go down there,
you make a right, then-

46:44.072 --> 46:47.520
When you get to that wide street... 
you know, that...  that...  that big one?

46:47.622 --> 46:50.525
- Yeah.
- You're just gonna stop and ask somebody.

46:51.623 --> 46:53.795
Okay. Okay, Mr. Lampshade.

46:55.815 --> 46:57.669
No, no, no, man. No.

46:57.769 --> 47:00.321
No, man. You be Mr. Lampshade.

47:00.424 --> 47:02.463
- I be Mr. Lampshade?
- Yeah!

47:02.568 --> 47:05.414
Okay. I be Mr. Lampshade.

47:07.527 --> 47:08.527
Yeah.

47:09.735 --> 47:11.622
Later for you, Helmet.

47:14.535 --> 47:17.604
"D" is to drive.

47:18.055 --> 47:21.699
Yeah. Yeah. You got it. Yeah.
"D." "D." "D" is to drive!

47:23.718 --> 47:25.541
Learn some English, Helmet!

47:26.982 --> 47:29.582
<i>Right.</i>

47:31.334 --> 47:34.466
<i>Right! Helmet, go right!</i>

47:38.118 --> 47:41.250
There's a nice family.

47:48.709 --> 47:51.970
Left...  or right?

48:12.902 --> 48:16.350
Uh, two rights. Two... 

48:21.926 --> 48:22.926
No.

48:23.846 --> 48:24.846
Huh?

48:25.766 --> 48:27.492
Straight.

48:28.837 --> 48:29.837
Here.

48:31.877 --> 48:35.477
<i>Ja, ja, ja.</i>

48:53.829 --> 48:55.555
New York.

48:55.845 --> 48:57.571
New York.

50:23.937 --> 50:26.011
- In the bag.
- In the bag.

50:26.435 --> 50:27.995
You're quite a guy!

50:28.418 --> 50:29.760
So am I.

50:30.531 --> 50:33.694
We sure impressed that ambassador.

50:33.794 --> 50:34.794
Ah!

50:35.138 --> 50:36.567
He's been taken in.

50:37.603 --> 50:40.385
More champagne! That's what we need.

50:40.771 --> 50:42.778
The way we suckered him... 

50:44.033 --> 50:46.935
What are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

50:47.617 --> 50:50.519
We told you to drive carefully.
We're important people.

50:50.626 --> 50:54.139
Hell yes! Extremely important people.

50:54.466 --> 50:56.375
If you only knew what's in this case.

50:56.546 --> 50:57.953
Don't you tell him.

50:58.401 --> 51:00.790
The Cameroon ambassador wants
to see us in the morning.

51:00.961 --> 51:01.920
In one piece.

51:02.020 --> 51:04.760
And you drive like a lizard,
first left, then right.

51:04.865 --> 51:06.458
You think you're in your jungle here?

51:07.618 --> 51:10.782
We're not from the
same jungle, are we? No.

51:11.009 --> 51:12.253
Drive carefully.

51:12.481 --> 51:16.507
These little brothers who come to
France, don't they have any respect?

51:16.641 --> 51:19.097
Did you even hear him say hello?

51:19.297 --> 51:21.817
Little brother, where do you
come from that you're so rude?

51:23.041 --> 51:24.041
You from Togo?

51:24.353 --> 51:25.353
From Gabon?

51:26.177 --> 51:28.990
You can't be from Cameroon. From Dakar?

51:29.090 --> 51:31.772
Wait, I'll have a closer look.

51:33.056 --> 51:34.944
If his looks don't kill you.

51:35.072 --> 51:36.796
With that face he might.

51:47.456 --> 51:48.471
I'll tell you.

51:48.576 --> 51:50.005
With a face like that,

51:50.145 --> 51:52.533
he must be a representative
of King Beyanzed.

51:53.889 --> 51:55.099
You're killing me.

51:55.969 --> 51:57.049
It's true!

51:57.185 --> 51:59.006
That's a Beninese's face!

51:59.106 --> 52:00.992
That's it. Benin.

52:02.689 --> 52:03.689
Little brother,

52:04.576 --> 52:05.754
are you from Benin?

52:08.353 --> 52:09.465
The Ivory Coast.

52:12.288 --> 52:13.782
Ivory Coast.

52:14.816 --> 52:16.604
<i>He's an 'Ivoirien'.</i>

52:19.295 --> 52:20.856
"Can't see a thing!"

52:20.991 --> 52:22.300
That explains it!

52:22.463 --> 52:24.503
<i>He's an "Y voit rien."</i>

52:25.568 --> 52:28.316
You've run four red lights,

52:28.416 --> 52:31.350
you can't see a thing, and you drive
at night without your glasses on.

52:33.375 --> 52:35.895
Don't leave your glasses at
home! Keep your eyes on the road.

52:36.255 --> 52:38.589
Look! The road is over there!

52:39.072 --> 52:41.941
<i>Who gives these people
cars? An Ivoirien!</i>

52:44.576 --> 52:48.088
What do you mean, "that explains it"?

52:48.191 --> 52:49.191
Ah?

52:50.847 --> 52:54.873
I work from 8:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.,
so don't fuck with me in my own taxi.

52:55.294 --> 52:57.334
And I don't give a shit
about your ambassador, okay?

52:57.982 --> 53:00.852
Can't we have some fun?

53:01.630 --> 53:04.052
We've had champagne, we're very happy... 

53:04.190 --> 53:07.092
No, you don't have fun in
my taxi. I work in this taxi.

53:07.263 --> 53:10.427
It's my place of business,
not your fucking playground!

53:11.006 --> 53:12.315
Okay, get out.

53:12.511 --> 53:13.485
What do you mean?

53:13.585 --> 53:15.355
Just get out of my taxi.

53:15.455 --> 53:17.756
Little brother, I only said... 

53:17.886 --> 53:19.096
Forget it. Just get out.

53:20.510 --> 53:21.510
Out of my taxi!

53:21.630 --> 53:23.735
But it's 4:00 in the morning.

53:26.590 --> 53:28.183
Little brother, what's wrong with you?

53:28.350 --> 53:30.008
Look where you're leaving us!

53:33.214 --> 53:35.386
Can you believe this guy?

53:35.486 --> 53:37.428
Does he expect us to find a taxi here?

53:42.461 --> 53:44.371
What a fucked-up day.

53:51.518 --> 53:53.949
<i>Rutain.</i>

53:54.049 --> 53:55.049
Big brothers, my ass... 

53:56.605 --> 53:59.671
Shit, they didn't even pay!

53:59.773 --> 54:01.660
I can't believe this shit.

54:11.293 --> 54:12.700
I'll kick your ass.

54:42.972 --> 54:45.111
Here's one that won't give me any shit.

54:58.621 --> 55:01.010
Nice driving, asshole.
You almost flattened me.

55:13.819 --> 55:14.899
What are we waiting for?

55:15.003 --> 55:17.043
Quai de l'Oise, near
Porte de la Villette.

55:17.339 --> 55:18.616
It's near the canal.

55:36.795 --> 55:38.835
At the next intersection

55:38.971 --> 55:41.784
just follow Canal St.
Martin up to Stalingrad Place

55:41.884 --> 55:43.639
then along Quai de la Seine.

55:44.123 --> 55:47.418
Look, I know my job. Don't
tell me how to do my job.

55:55.034 --> 55:58.515
IF YOU HAVE A PREFERRED ROUTE,
INDICATE THIS TO THE DRIVER

56:02.106 --> 56:05.270
Doesn't this sign say
to follow my directions?

56:41.273 --> 56:43.281
Did you change something?

56:44.089 --> 56:45.975
What, me? Nothing!

56:56.121 --> 56:58.139
<i>Pardon.</i>

56:58.780 --> 57:01.585
Don't they teach you how to
drive before unleashing you?

57:47.911 --> 57:49.544
What are we doing in this tunnel?

57:49.730 --> 57:53.230
Why'd you take the fucking tunnel?
I didn't tell you to go this way!

57:58.072 --> 57:59.731
I hate the tunnel.

58:12.598 --> 58:14.159
Hold still. I got it.

58:19.383 --> 58:21.984
<i>Merci.</i>

58:57.014 --> 58:59.600
Hey, don't blind people
usually wear dark glasses?

58:59.702 --> 59:03.346
Do they? I wouldn't know.
I've never seen a blind person.

59:12.182 --> 59:13.808
You've always been blind?

59:14.198 --> 59:15.198
Yeah.

59:22.418 --> 59:24.523
Must be a real drag being blind, huh?

59:24.625 --> 59:27.114
Listen, jerk-off. I
can do anything you can

59:27.218 --> 59:28.876
and a lot of things you'll never do.

59:29.074 --> 59:30.601
I'm blind, that's all.

59:31.345 --> 59:33.866
You can't drive a car, for example.

59:34.033 --> 59:35.559
And you can?

59:44.945 --> 59:46.538
I didn't mean to make you mad.

59:47.601 --> 59:50.154
I don't know any blind people.
I'm curious, that's all.

59:50.513 --> 59:54.604
I'm just like you. I drink,
I eat, I taste things.

59:56.049 --> 59:59.115
I listen to music. I feel music.

01:00:00.017 --> 01:00:02.472
I do whatever I want.
I even go to the movies.

01:00:04.817 --> 01:00:06.027
The movies?

01:00:07.601 --> 01:00:09.259
And what do you see at the movies?

01:00:11.825 --> 01:00:13.417
Sometimes I feel the film.

01:00:15.055 --> 01:00:16.055
I can hear it.

01:00:17.264 --> 01:00:19.304
Oh, forget it. You're a pain in the ass.

01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:24.427
Yeah, but when you eat,
you can't see the food.

01:00:25.104 --> 01:00:28.039
The carrots could be blue, for example.

01:00:29.455 --> 01:00:31.627
And with music, you
can't see the musicians!

01:00:31.792 --> 01:00:33.799
You don't even know
the shape of a guitar.

01:00:33.904 --> 01:00:36.391
Yes I know the shape
of a fucking guitar.

01:00:36.527 --> 01:00:38.797
I feel things I'm sure you never will.

01:00:52.784 --> 01:00:56.875
Okay then, if you're so smart,
let me ask you a question.

01:00:58.672 --> 01:01:00.525
Here's the question.

01:01:01.295 --> 01:01:02.789
What color am I?

01:01:03.151 --> 01:01:05.006
I don't give a fuck about colors.

01:01:06.159 --> 01:01:08.647
But people have
different colors of skin!

01:01:08.751 --> 01:01:13.061
Look, I don't care if you're
green or...  blue like a carrot.

01:01:13.199 --> 01:01:15.468
For me the word color
doesn't mean anything.

01:01:15.823 --> 01:01:17.165
I feel colors.

01:01:18.319 --> 01:01:20.042
But you'd never understand that.

01:01:30.799 --> 01:01:33.187
Okay. You hear my voice, my accent.

01:01:33.903 --> 01:01:35.147
Tell me where I'm from.

01:01:36.815 --> 01:01:39.465
And if I'm right I win
a color TV, is that it?

01:01:41.903 --> 01:01:43.626
I don't know, Africa.

01:01:46.542 --> 01:01:47.655
From Cameroon.

01:01:49.102 --> 01:01:50.312
No, the Ivory Coast.

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:54.390
Not bad!

01:01:55.726 --> 01:01:58.311
You're exactly right! Treichville.

01:03:00.461 --> 01:03:02.501
Can I ask you something personal?

01:03:03.117 --> 01:03:04.523
What now?

01:03:09.709 --> 01:03:11.464
What's it like in bed?

01:03:12.299 --> 01:03:13.674
What in bed?

01:03:16.012 --> 01:03:20.267
With a man, if you can't see
anything, when you make love,

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:24.263
how do you know who's next to you,

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:29.025
who you're making love with?

01:03:32.811 --> 01:03:36.107
Listen, when I make love it's
with every centimeter of my body,

01:03:36.236 --> 01:03:39.236
every pore of my skin.
Unlike you, I'm sure.

01:03:40.651 --> 01:03:42.888
Believe me, I know the
man I make love with.

01:03:44.683 --> 01:03:46.952
Even when he's on the
stairs, I know it's him.

01:03:47.788 --> 01:03:49.642
I can smell him from a block away.

01:03:51.563 --> 01:03:54.116
A block away! He must really stink.

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:55.859
Fuck you.

01:03:56.043 --> 01:03:59.142
I'm glad I can't see you, 'cause
you must be an ugly bastard.

01:04:00.779 --> 01:04:01.826
That's right.

01:04:47.722 --> 01:04:50.673
<i>Et voilÃ .</i>

01:04:50.773 --> 01:04:51.681
Is this Quai de l'Oise?

01:04:51.781 --> 01:04:53.940
<i>Ouais.</i>

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.040
Which side?

01:04:55.466 --> 01:04:57.539
West of the canal, facing
Porte de la Villette.

01:04:57.641 --> 01:04:59.384
<i>OK.</i>

01:04:59.484 --> 01:05:00.484
How much is it?

01:05:03.242 --> 01:05:04.257
Forty francs.

01:05:04.969 --> 01:05:07.424
Listen, asshole. I've been
trapped in here longer than that,

01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:09.701
and I don't need your fuckin' charity.

01:05:10.729 --> 01:05:12.136
It must be 48 or 49.

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:13.857
Here's 50.

01:05:14.025 --> 01:05:15.203
Keep the change.

01:05:16.938 --> 01:05:18.727
You think I was born yesterday?

01:05:37.608 --> 01:05:38.982
Watch out for yourself!

01:05:40.169 --> 01:05:42.176
Watch out yourself.

01:06:33.543 --> 01:06:35.844
Don't you look where you're
going? We're not in Africa here!

01:06:35.944 --> 01:06:37.285
You're a racist!

01:06:37.479 --> 01:06:40.065
No, I'm not a racist, but you
drive like a fuckin' black!

01:06:40.775 --> 01:06:42.979
The road goes this way,
and you were going that way!

01:06:43.815 --> 01:06:45.571
Are you blind or what?

01:06:46.824 --> 01:06:48.068
But it's not my fault!

01:08:54.372 --> 01:08:57.242
<i>~ I see by your outfit ~</i>

01:08:57.348 --> 01:09:00.381
<i>~ That you are a cowboy ~</i>

01:09:06.082 --> 01:09:07.904
I can't see a thing.

01:09:08.803 --> 01:09:11.291
They could put up a streetlight
once in a while in Rome.

01:09:29.252 --> 01:09:32.481
Would you like to meet
and make love?

01:09:32.611 --> 01:09:35.611
<i>Confirmed. I repeat,
send a car immediately.</i>

01:09:35.779 --> 01:09:37.372
Where should we do it?

01:09:37.475 --> 01:09:39.068
<i>12 Marmoratta Street.</i>

01:09:39.171 --> 01:09:40.133
And then?

01:09:40.233 --> 01:09:41.158
<i>Buffalota Street, number 40.</i>

01:09:41.258 --> 01:09:42.212
And after?

01:09:42.313 --> 01:09:44.346
<i>Piazza Quadrata, but there is no number.</i>

01:09:44.578 --> 01:09:47.742
Okay, we'll do it in Piazza Quadrata.

01:09:47.874 --> 01:09:50.045
<i>Correct, confirmed,
but there is no number.</i>

01:09:51.618 --> 01:09:53.374
How many times will we do it?

01:09:53.603 --> 01:09:55.097
<i>One thousand and one.</i>

01:09:55.202 --> 01:09:56.380
How soon?

01:09:56.739 --> 01:09:58.332
<i>Five minutes. Three cars.</i>

01:09:58.434 --> 01:10:01.729
Three taxis? You little
slut! We're through.

01:10:21.794 --> 01:10:24.216
Hotel Genius. What a name for a hotel!

01:10:24.514 --> 01:10:26.849
Good evening. I'd like a room between... 

01:10:27.715 --> 01:10:29.951
Leonardo da Vinci and Einstein.

01:10:30.147 --> 01:10:31.869
Yes, thank you. Who's this?

01:10:32.002 --> 01:10:33.179
Dante Alighieri, how's it going?

01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:35.648
I'm here having coffee with Shakespeare.

01:10:35.777 --> 01:10:36.777
Isaac Newton!

01:10:36.929 --> 01:10:37.944
Beethoven!

01:10:38.305 --> 01:10:40.542
Beethoven, I'd like you
to meet Charlie Parker.

01:10:44.417 --> 01:10:45.824
Say something to him, Charlie.

01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:56.064
Charlie Parker at the Hotel Genius... 

01:10:57.986 --> 01:10:59.960
If there's no room at the Hotel Genius

01:11:00.161 --> 01:11:02.103
I'll take a room at the Hotel Imbecile.

01:11:11.072 --> 01:11:13.375
Rome deserted.

01:11:14.464 --> 01:11:16.057
Beautiful city.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.389
The Romans have all left Rome.

01:11:18.497 --> 01:11:19.741
Where did they go?

01:11:19.936 --> 01:11:21.398
Everyone's in Bergamo.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.542
What do they do in Bergamo?

01:11:35.008 --> 01:11:37.278
I love these one-way streets!

01:11:39.776 --> 01:11:42.264
It's like bumper cars.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:46.360
"In the middle of the
journey of our life,

01:11:46.496 --> 01:11:48.700
oh, dear friends, to you I convey,

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.386
I found myself down a street one way."

01:12:00.927 --> 01:12:03.383
It's a one-way street!

01:12:04.383 --> 01:12:07.132
That's right, it's one-way, you jerk!

01:12:16.127 --> 01:12:17.785
This wall wasn't here yesterday!

01:12:17.983 --> 01:12:19.990
Like Saint Pete, I will retreat.

01:12:22.623 --> 01:12:26.300
And like the saints that
led, I'll move ahead.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.694
Another one-way street!

01:12:29.823 --> 01:12:32.823
They're always changing
everything. Fuckin' idiots... 

01:12:39.295 --> 01:12:40.407
I'm dangerous?

01:12:40.895 --> 01:12:43.350
I've got a taxi and they've got guns

01:12:43.583 --> 01:12:45.306
and I'm dangerous!

01:12:48.702 --> 01:12:52.018
I should turn around
and run them both over.

01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:56.916
<i>~ I see by your outfit ~</i>

01:13:23.358 --> 01:13:26.107
A bishop alone in Rome
at 4:00 a.m.!

01:13:26.493 --> 01:13:27.605
Bad luck! Touch my balls.

01:14:06.301 --> 01:14:09.017
Excuse me, Father.
The statue confused me.

01:14:09.117 --> 01:14:11.124
I couldn't see you. Excuse me.

01:14:11.259 --> 01:14:14.488
Across town, please. To Tiburtino.

01:14:14.588 --> 01:14:16.977
Tiburtino? Not the Vatican?
Aren't you a bishop?

01:14:17.244 --> 01:14:20.725
No, not the Vatican.
And I'm not a bishop.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:55.765
Father, I want to tell
you that I'm deeply honored

01:14:55.963 --> 01:14:57.937
to have a bishop in my taxi.

01:14:58.651 --> 01:15:01.040
My dear son, I'm not a bishop.

01:15:01.339 --> 01:15:03.761
Yes, I know, you're not a bishop, but... 

01:15:10.171 --> 01:15:12.822
My son, may I ask you a favor?

01:15:13.083 --> 01:15:14.163
Anything, Father!

01:15:14.555 --> 01:15:16.594
Could you remove your sunglasses?

01:15:16.731 --> 01:15:19.480
It's not safe to drive at
night with dark glasses.

01:15:25.979 --> 01:15:27.505
<i>Grazie, padre.</i>

01:15:27.611 --> 01:15:30.328
I put them on this morning
and forgot I was wearing them.

01:15:31.099 --> 01:15:33.074
I see better now. Thank you!

01:15:34.427 --> 01:15:38.419
I feel like a blind man who's
miraculously recovered his sight!

01:15:38.522 --> 01:15:40.409
<i>Grazie, padre. Grazie tante.</i>

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:57.029
<i>Padre.</i>

01:15:57.129 --> 01:15:58.261
Everything okay, Father?

01:15:58.426 --> 01:15:59.735
Everything's okay.

01:16:29.977 --> 01:16:33.589
Excuse me, but it says NO SMOKING.

01:16:33.913 --> 01:16:37.142
That sign? I keep forgetting
to get rid of it. Sorry, Father.

01:16:39.417 --> 01:16:42.548
They put one in every
taxi. It's ridiculous.

01:17:12.152 --> 01:17:15.698
Father, I know this will
sound a little strange,

01:17:15.896 --> 01:17:18.198
but here we are alone,
at night in a taxi,

01:17:19.096 --> 01:17:21.104
and it's a little embarrassing,

01:17:21.368 --> 01:17:22.677
but I would like to confess.

01:17:24.024 --> 01:17:26.512
But this is not the
appropriate place, my son.

01:17:27.256 --> 01:17:28.979
I know, I said it myself

01:17:29.112 --> 01:17:32.592
we're in a taxi, not church,
but I must confess, Father.

01:17:33.016 --> 01:17:35.983
Dear son, confession is an
act that must remain anonymous.

01:17:36.088 --> 01:17:39.862
The church must preserve
this anonymity. Otherwise... 

01:17:40.728 --> 01:17:43.411
But I promise I won't tell anyone!

01:17:44.536 --> 01:17:46.957
I'm not Roman, I'm Tuscan.

01:17:47.064 --> 01:17:49.235
I've had this taxi for
15 years here in Rome,

01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:50.545
and in 15 years

01:17:50.647 --> 01:17:53.167
I swear I've never picked
up the same person twice.

01:17:53.719 --> 01:17:56.304
And even if I picked
you up again in 10 years

01:17:56.535 --> 01:17:58.324
I wouldn't recognize
you, dressed as a bishop.

01:17:58.647 --> 01:18:01.102
And I promise I won't
look you in the face.

01:18:01.431 --> 01:18:03.286
After all, I've got to drive.

01:18:05.271 --> 01:18:07.573
I must confess. Please!

01:18:08.471 --> 01:18:11.787
You won't have to pay the fare, okay?

01:18:13.655 --> 01:18:17.070
If you don't hear my confession,
I'm afraid I'll burn in hell.

01:18:17.463 --> 01:18:19.568
But this is unacceptable.

01:18:21.271 --> 01:18:24.086
Father, I've got so
many sins to confess.

01:18:26.135 --> 01:18:29.484
First thing, when I was
about 12 or 13 years old,

01:18:29.686 --> 01:18:32.436
when boys become big men,

01:18:32.695 --> 01:18:34.701
well, each his own physique... 

01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:40.751
and you begin to feel that
desire for, how can I say it... 

01:18:41.142 --> 01:18:42.142
for love!

01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:43.390
For sex!

01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:45.394
You feel the need for

01:18:45.974 --> 01:18:47.086
release!

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:54.027
You understand? To
relieve this desire to... 

01:18:56.118 --> 01:18:59.914
Anyway, I lived in the country
and there weren't many women,

01:19:00.053 --> 01:19:01.941
and though you're still a kid,

01:19:03.702 --> 01:19:05.873
inside you feel a man's feeling,

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:11.052
and there was no way
to...  release this feeling.

01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:17.266
So the idea, not mine, but a
real intelligent friend of mine's,

01:19:17.366 --> 01:19:19.470
of relieving ourselves with... 

01:19:19.604 --> 01:19:22.387
we made love with...  how do I say this?

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:24.915
With pumpkins.

01:19:25.813 --> 01:19:29.458
Warm, soft, damp, with
seeds inside, so round... 

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:36.497
And we would...  Help me
find the words, Father.

01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:39.533
We relieved ourselves
with these pumpkins.

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:46.217
But then, after a certain age, I quit.

01:19:46.901 --> 01:19:49.202
I don't know if my friends
quit, but that's their business.

01:19:50.932 --> 01:19:54.348
I quit because I felt, Father,
and I'm sure you'll agree,

01:19:54.453 --> 01:19:58.315
in growing up to be a
sensitive, even religious man,

01:19:58.421 --> 01:20:01.104
that love is something every man needs

01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:04.112
not with a vegetable, but with something

01:20:04.404 --> 01:20:05.405
alive!

01:20:06.228 --> 01:20:11.214
Something that moves, that's
warm, that looks you in the eyes.

01:20:11.732 --> 01:20:13.772
Something with a soul.

01:20:14.292 --> 01:20:15.632
Anyway, there was a... 

01:20:15.732 --> 01:20:17.194
a sheep.

01:20:17.299 --> 01:20:19.055
A beautiful little sheep!

01:20:21.139 --> 01:20:24.784
She was nice, kind, sweet, pretty.

01:20:25.491 --> 01:20:27.117
I called her Lola.

01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:29.773
Not an ugly old sheep like the others,

01:20:30.228 --> 01:20:33.010
but a little sheep.
So delicate, refined!

01:20:33.652 --> 01:20:36.816
Soft wool, two big eyes watching me.

01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:39.536
At first I didn't even notice.

01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:44.173
And what a sweet little voice!

01:20:47.539 --> 01:20:49.295
And I was enchanted.

01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:50.490
Not like the other sheep.

01:20:53.651 --> 01:20:56.651
Her movements were so refined.

01:20:59.698 --> 01:21:01.673
She'd come beside me, and somehow

01:21:02.130 --> 01:21:03.756
I was always on top of her.

01:21:06.099 --> 01:21:08.750
She was so pretty...  even erotic!

01:21:10.739 --> 01:21:12.648
She would embarrass me because

01:21:14.131 --> 01:21:16.814
she would come around
when I was with my friends.

01:21:20.499 --> 01:21:23.314
People began to notice
this. It was embarrassing.

01:21:24.210 --> 01:21:26.316
In fact, finally my father noticed.

01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:28.465
A horrible memory.

01:21:28.723 --> 01:21:30.577
Do you know what my father did?

01:21:30.706 --> 01:21:32.561
He sold her to a

01:21:36.562 --> 01:21:37.772
a butcher.

01:21:39.217 --> 01:21:41.901
He sold my Lola to a butcher!

01:21:42.258 --> 01:21:45.007
A butcher named Guido Rusticoni.

01:21:45.138 --> 01:21:49.611
A fat, hairy, sweaty
guy. Rude, uneducated.

01:21:49.777 --> 01:21:53.258
Really ugly, disgusting.
He was horrible.

01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:56.427
My Lola to a butcher for 80,000 lire.

01:21:56.658 --> 01:21:59.854
I felt so badly that I
haven't eaten meat since.

01:22:00.146 --> 01:22:03.048
Even now when they ask me,
"Do you want some lamb?"

01:22:03.282 --> 01:22:05.420
Me, lamb? No, thanks.

01:22:05.841 --> 01:22:08.809
I don't eat vegetables either,
because of the pumpkins.

01:22:09.362 --> 01:22:11.882
In fact, I don't eat
much at all anymore.

01:22:12.786 --> 01:22:15.240
It was very traumatic for me.

01:22:15.569 --> 01:22:20.271
What I want to say is, I
understand that these are big sins,

01:22:21.456 --> 01:22:24.107
but truly, Father,
they are sins of love.

01:22:33.936 --> 01:22:37.482
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

01:22:51.537 --> 01:22:52.780
<i>Ciao, Gino!</i>

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.280
<i>Ciao.</i>

01:22:57.041 --> 01:22:59.178
Gino, how are you?

01:23:00.399 --> 01:23:01.361
<i>Ciao.</i>

01:23:01.461 --> 01:23:04.524
Nothing's going on,
really. No customers.

01:23:04.655 --> 01:23:05.932
It's a lousy night.

01:23:06.384 --> 01:23:08.391
Nothing here either. A real slow night.

01:23:08.528 --> 01:23:10.732
We haven't made a cent.

01:23:12.079 --> 01:23:13.079
A bishop.

01:23:13.264 --> 01:23:14.507
A bishop?!

01:23:14.607 --> 01:23:16.615
A real one? Oh, let me see!

01:23:17.039 --> 01:23:19.690
What a darling little bishop!

01:23:25.936 --> 01:23:26.950
He's charming.

01:23:29.744 --> 01:23:32.013
Stop by later, okay?

01:23:38.992 --> 01:23:41.393
<i>Ciao.</i>

01:23:42.127 --> 01:23:44.331
Gino always cheers me up.

01:23:47.823 --> 01:23:49.546
Pretty girls, eh?

01:23:49.807 --> 01:23:52.654
So, my brother Vincenzo
lives here in Rome too.

01:23:53.071 --> 01:23:56.300
He's a plumber. Repairs pipes, water.

01:23:56.463 --> 01:23:58.405
One night he invited me to dinner,

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:01.706
he and my
sister-in-law. Monica.

01:24:02.063 --> 01:24:04.102
So I went to their house.

01:24:04.207 --> 01:24:06.989
They have a female dog too. Very cute.

01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:10.822
So after dinner, he
got an emergency call.

01:24:13.518 --> 01:24:17.447
The pipes exploded in a
condominium. Water everywhere.

01:24:19.278 --> 01:24:21.766
And like a lightning bolt,
he ran off with his tools,

01:24:23.022 --> 01:24:25.291
and I was left alone with Monica.

01:24:25.519 --> 01:24:28.649
Now, Monica is beautiful!
You should see her.

01:24:28.781 --> 01:24:30.821
Absolutely gorgeous.

01:24:33.006 --> 01:24:35.373
She really likes me.

01:24:36.013 --> 01:24:40.454
She always looks at me with those
strange "sister-in-law eyes."

01:24:40.653 --> 01:24:42.857
At their wedding I
said, "Congratulations!"

01:24:43.693 --> 01:24:45.602
But she looked at me strangely.

01:24:45.741 --> 01:24:48.359
She married my brother,
and we're the same type.

01:24:48.462 --> 01:24:50.764
I'm even more handsome than he is.

01:24:51.342 --> 01:24:53.251
So Monica and I were alone.

01:24:53.581 --> 01:24:56.102
She started to clean up at the sink.

01:24:56.398 --> 01:24:59.878
As she bent over, I was
sitting behind her like this,

01:25:00.686 --> 01:25:03.337
and from this position I saw

01:25:03.533 --> 01:25:04.613
two cheeks!

01:25:07.406 --> 01:25:10.023
An ass from out of this world!

01:25:10.125 --> 01:25:11.750
With tiny white panties,

01:25:11.853 --> 01:25:14.755
riding up a little so you
could see one whole cheek!

01:25:14.892 --> 01:25:16.136
The other was partly covered.

01:25:16.237 --> 01:25:20.033
Father, I couldn't control myself!

01:25:20.493 --> 01:25:23.875
She turned and looked back
at me with those eyes... 

01:25:25.932 --> 01:25:28.169
and suddenly I was on top of her.

01:25:28.365 --> 01:25:30.219
Father, that beautiful ass!

01:25:31.532 --> 01:25:35.045
Pink, soft, round like a pumpkin!

01:25:35.341 --> 01:25:38.243
Those soft, wool panties
reminded me of the sheep,

01:25:38.412 --> 01:25:40.649
the pumpkin, the sheep,
my brother's wife... 

01:25:41.165 --> 01:25:42.692
I was on fire!

01:25:44.364 --> 01:25:47.528
Then we were on the
floor, under the table!

01:25:48.364 --> 01:25:49.672
The beauty of it!

01:25:49.772 --> 01:25:53.863
What pleasure! We enjoyed
ourselves like...  imagine, Father... 

01:25:53.996 --> 01:25:55.883
Heaven on earth!

01:25:57.003 --> 01:26:00.582
I said to myself, "But
this is my brother's wife!"

01:26:00.683 --> 01:26:02.177
But I couldn't stop!

01:26:02.284 --> 01:26:05.699
And I said it again, "It's
your brother's wife! Stop!"

01:26:05.804 --> 01:26:07.047
But I couldn't!

01:26:09.163 --> 01:26:10.984
It lasted hours!

01:26:11.084 --> 01:26:13.025
And she screamed!

01:26:13.132 --> 01:26:15.619
And I screamed!

01:26:15.724 --> 01:26:17.447
It was terrible.

01:26:17.611 --> 01:26:18.920
Just beautiful.

01:26:19.179 --> 01:26:20.194
I turned her over,

01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:25.125
kissed her all over, her
neck, her perfect breasts... 

01:26:25.835 --> 01:26:27.974
I stayed there all night.

01:26:28.811 --> 01:26:31.494
I never went back because
she's my brother's wife,

01:26:31.915 --> 01:26:33.770
although he never noticed anything.

01:26:33.964 --> 01:26:35.971
Now she smiles whenever she sees me... 

01:26:36.076 --> 01:26:37.319
<i>Ciao. Ciao.</i>

01:26:37.419 --> 01:26:41.313
and I say, "Remember when we
fucked like animals on the floor?"

01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:43.938
It was truly paradise!

01:26:44.042 --> 01:26:46.115
My gorgeous
sister-in-law!

01:26:47.082 --> 01:26:50.465
I don't know if you ever made love
with your sister-in-law, Father,

01:26:50.602 --> 01:26:54.464
but you should try it,
because it's absolute heaven.

01:26:54.602 --> 01:26:57.090
Then you just confess. It's incredible.

01:26:57.482 --> 01:27:01.760
Father, I know these
sins must be confessed,

01:27:02.155 --> 01:27:04.162
but they were just so wonderful.

01:27:09.419 --> 01:27:11.240
<i>Bellissima.</i>

01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:14.582
<i>Eh, padre?</i>

01:27:14.682 --> 01:27:16.648
<i>Oh-oh. Padre.</i>

01:27:19.435 --> 01:27:21.290
I haven't upset you, have I?

01:27:21.481 --> 01:27:22.594
I guess he fell asleep.

01:27:24.009 --> 01:27:26.587
<i>Padre.</i>

01:27:26.687 --> 01:27:27.816
Padre.

01:27:32.233 --> 01:27:34.636
<i>Padre!</i>

01:27:34.736 --> 01:27:35.940
Father, don't fool around!

01:27:36.041 --> 01:27:38.642
<i>Padre!</i>

01:27:41.673 --> 01:27:45.512
<i>Padre. Padre.</i>

01:27:45.612 --> 01:27:47.232
Not feeling well?

01:27:47.337 --> 01:27:50.968
<i>Padre. Padre.</i>

01:27:51.068 --> 01:27:52.968
You're not...  dead, are
you? I don't hear anything!

01:27:53.161 --> 01:27:54.176
Holy shit!

01:27:54.281 --> 01:27:56.646
<i>Padre! Padre!</i>

01:27:56.746 --> 01:27:58.631
<i>Padre. Padre!</i>

01:27:58.731 --> 01:28:00.485
It's me, your taxi driver!

01:28:00.969 --> 01:28:02.398
I've killed him!

01:28:07.881 --> 01:28:10.084
My God, what have I done?

01:28:10.761 --> 01:28:11.723
He's dead!

01:28:11.823 --> 01:28:13.575
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

01:28:15.432 --> 01:28:17.253
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

01:28:17.353 --> 01:28:18.846
I've killed a priest.

01:28:18.984 --> 01:28:20.959
Even worse, a bishop!

01:28:23.401 --> 01:28:24.808
They'll give me life!

01:28:25.128 --> 01:28:27.714
How many years do you get
for a bishop? Twenty? Thirty?

01:28:28.808 --> 01:28:31.187
<i>Padre!</i>

01:28:31.287 --> 01:28:32.287
Are you asleep?

01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:33.793
Joking?

01:28:35.528 --> 01:28:37.383
He's dead. I've killed a priest!

01:28:37.704 --> 01:28:39.133
I'll be in all the papers:

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:41.062
TAXI DRIVER KILLS BISHOP

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:44.733
My brother will find out
everything about me and Monica!

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.247
What a fucking mess!

01:28:47.464 --> 01:28:51.464
<i>Padre! Padre.</i>

01:28:51.879 --> 01:28:54.214
And such a nice little
priest. So delicate!

01:28:54.439 --> 01:28:57.406
I shouldn't have told him
about the sheep and Monica!

01:28:58.567 --> 01:29:01.567
I'm sorry, Father. Now
I'll really burn in hell!

01:29:01.671 --> 01:29:04.060
<i>Padre! Padre!</i>

01:29:04.168 --> 01:29:06.818
Where should I put him?

01:30:08.518 --> 01:30:11.169
Only a priest, but he weighs
enough to be a cardinal.

01:34:59.935 --> 01:35:03.230
<i>40 India Street, first call.</i>

01:35:04.127 --> 01:35:07.061
<i>40 India Street, car
needed. Second call.</i>

01:35:08.383 --> 01:35:13.653
<i>Car 285 to India Street. Thanks, 285.</i>

01:35:17.087 --> 01:35:21.527
<i>29 Industrial Road, three
customers waiting. First call.</i>

01:35:22.399 --> 01:35:25.976
<i>29 Industrial Road, three
customers. Second call.</i>

01:35:26.814 --> 01:35:30.523
<i>Industrial Road 29, three
customers. Third call.</i>

01:35:33.406 --> 01:35:35.773
Car 101 will take Industrial Road.

01:35:38.366 --> 01:35:40.537
<i>Hi, Mika! Okay. Bye, bye.</i>

01:35:42.013 --> 01:35:43.013
Bye, bye.

01:36:51.644 --> 01:36:53.050
You called a taxi?

01:36:54.076 --> 01:36:56.083
No, we called a garbage truck.

01:36:57.660 --> 01:36:59.994
But you'll have to do the job.

01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:16.176
Is he all right?

01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:19.987
No, he's not all right.

01:37:21.555 --> 01:37:23.148
But don't worry about it.

01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:27.787
Let's go.

01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:29.660
Where?

01:37:31.251 --> 01:37:32.251
Home.

01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:35.725
My house is closest,
so drop me off first.

01:37:36.372 --> 01:37:38.378
We're gonna take Aki home first.

01:37:39.538 --> 01:37:41.710
But he lives furthest
away, and he's fucked-up.

01:37:42.131 --> 01:37:44.520
You're the one who's
fucked-up. He's our friend,

01:37:44.723 --> 01:37:47.625
and in that condition, we've got
to make sure he gets home okay.

01:37:47.859 --> 01:37:49.103
Then you'll have to pay.

01:37:49.298 --> 01:37:50.313
But I don't have any money!

01:37:50.514 --> 01:37:51.627
Well, I don't either!

01:37:53.651 --> 01:37:56.465
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:37:57.459 --> 01:37:58.833
What about him?

01:38:01.331 --> 01:38:03.469
His severance pay.

01:38:04.179 --> 01:38:06.219
Okay, we've got money.

01:38:06.739 --> 01:38:07.739
Let's go.

01:38:08.146 --> 01:38:09.226
Where?

01:38:10.099 --> 01:38:12.335
We all live on the same block.

01:38:13.010 --> 01:38:14.865
Just drive across town.

01:38:51.058 --> 01:38:52.584
What's your name?

01:38:53.202 --> 01:38:54.202
Mika.

01:38:55.666 --> 01:38:58.765
When I was a kid I had
a hamster named Mika.

01:38:58.865 --> 01:39:00.753
Mika. Mika.

01:39:04.689 --> 01:39:07.820
By the way, what was that
about his severance pay?

01:39:09.617 --> 01:39:11.624
He lost his job today.

01:39:13.872 --> 01:39:14.887
Is he all right?

01:39:16.496 --> 01:39:18.569
No, he's not all right.

01:39:18.961 --> 01:39:22.256
Didn't he just tell you
that he lost his job today?

01:39:24.528 --> 01:39:26.667
He's all fucked-up,

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:30.888
and losing his job is
just a small part of it.

01:39:32.208 --> 01:39:33.321
What do you mean?

01:39:34.929 --> 01:39:38.409
Today was the worst fuckin'
day of his entire life,

01:39:39.536 --> 01:39:41.260
that's what I fuckin' mean.

01:39:44.081 --> 01:39:47.016
Or yesterday was, anyway... 

01:39:51.248 --> 01:39:52.458
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:39:55.215 --> 01:39:56.874
What would you know about it?

01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:00.549
You have no idea how he feels.

01:40:04.751 --> 01:40:07.751
At the moment, I doubt
he feels much of anything.

01:40:09.936 --> 01:40:14.126
Look, Mr. Taxi Man, don't fuck with us!

01:40:14.415 --> 01:40:16.837
Be careful, you idiot! He's driving!

01:40:17.039 --> 01:40:18.039
You're the idiot!

01:40:18.191 --> 01:40:21.126
Stop! Or you morons can walk home!

01:40:41.230 --> 01:40:42.572
Can I ask something?

01:40:44.078 --> 01:40:45.079
What?

01:40:46.927 --> 01:40:50.636
Your friend. What happened
to him that was so terrible?

01:40:51.407 --> 01:40:52.650
Besides losing his job, I mean.

01:40:55.407 --> 01:40:57.261
What was so terrible?

01:40:58.574 --> 01:41:00.963
I'll tell you what was so terrible.

01:41:02.191 --> 01:41:05.736
This morning he drives his car to work.

01:41:05.967 --> 01:41:08.039
New car, just paid off.

01:41:09.263 --> 01:41:11.434
He parks and goes to work.

01:41:13.774 --> 01:41:16.229
He's late for work,
but that's nothing new.

01:41:16.749 --> 01:41:19.237
But today, bad news:

01:41:19.533 --> 01:41:21.027
he's fired.

01:41:21.230 --> 01:41:23.237
Late once too often.

01:41:24.558 --> 01:41:26.947
So then he has a big
fight with his boss.

01:41:27.086 --> 01:41:30.119
They throw him out into the street

01:41:30.349 --> 01:41:32.357
and his severance pay after him.

01:41:34.957 --> 01:41:38.121
He picks up the envelope,
brushes himself off

01:41:38.221 --> 01:41:40.709
and walks back to his car.

01:41:41.198 --> 01:41:44.580
But instead of his brand-new car

01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:51.019
there's a smashed,
fucked-up ghost of his car.

01:41:51.373 --> 01:41:52.780
Smashed to fuckin' shit.

01:41:53.966 --> 01:41:57.610
Some fuckin' idiot has
turned his brand-new car

01:41:58.125 --> 01:41:59.783
into a useless pile of shit.

01:42:01.132 --> 01:42:05.475
So he has a few drinks to calm
down, then takes a bus home.

01:42:05.676 --> 01:42:09.419
At home, waiting for him, are
his wife and 16-year-old daughter.

01:42:09.868 --> 01:42:14.375
They're both crying, and the wife
tells him they have a big problem.

01:42:15.757 --> 01:42:19.718
Then the daughter runs
off to her room, crying.

01:42:19.916 --> 01:42:23.331
And the wife tells him that
his daughter, 16 and unmarried,

01:42:23.533 --> 01:42:24.842
is pregnant.

01:42:25.037 --> 01:42:27.524
A beautiful girl too, his daughter.

01:42:27.788 --> 01:42:32.458
You shut up! That's no way to talk
about our best friend's little daughter.

01:42:32.621 --> 01:42:33.897
I didn't mean it like that!

01:42:33.997 --> 01:42:37.859
I know what you meant,
you fuckin' slimy fungus!

01:42:39.245 --> 01:42:40.772
So, is that all?

01:42:42.444 --> 01:42:44.135
No, that's not all.

01:42:45.356 --> 01:42:48.454
He tells his wife that he's lost his job

01:42:48.651 --> 01:42:50.658
and then about their car.

01:42:51.468 --> 01:42:55.974
She becomes hysterical and
screams that she wants a divorce.

01:42:57.259 --> 01:43:00.837
That he's no good as
a father or a husband.

01:43:02.059 --> 01:43:04.514
And then she chases him from the house

01:43:05.195 --> 01:43:07.018
with a big fuckin' butcher's knife.

01:43:07.211 --> 01:43:08.211
A bread knife.

01:43:08.363 --> 01:43:09.476
A butcher's knife!

01:43:09.739 --> 01:43:11.430
He said it was a bread knife!

01:43:11.659 --> 01:43:15.937
<i>- No, he made a point of saying it was
a butcher's knife! - OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.</i>

01:43:16.043 --> 01:43:18.043
<i>OK.</i>

01:43:59.914 --> 01:44:01.703
Things could have been worse.

01:44:05.995 --> 01:44:07.817
What could possibly be worse than that?

01:44:09.898 --> 01:44:12.766
Okay, Mr. Taxi Man.

01:44:13.993 --> 01:44:17.637
Whatever happened to you
that was worse than that?

01:44:19.465 --> 01:44:20.610
You want me to tell you?

01:44:21.833 --> 01:44:22.833
Yeah.

01:44:23.593 --> 01:44:26.113
Do you have any children?

01:44:26.825 --> 01:44:27.839
I have a son.

01:44:28.105 --> 01:44:29.152
I have a daughter.

01:44:30.665 --> 01:44:33.829
I'm glad I have a son
and not a daughter.

01:44:33.994 --> 01:44:36.263
You're an idiot. A
daughter is much better.

01:44:36.745 --> 01:44:39.560
That way you won't have a son
who'll grow up to be like you.

01:44:40.681 --> 01:44:42.820
Even more important then, in your case.

01:44:43.049 --> 01:44:45.383
- In your case, soon nothing
will be important! - Hey!

01:44:45.577 --> 01:44:48.479
Knock it off! Or you
idiots will have a long walk.

01:44:55.689 --> 01:44:58.754
What about the terrible story
you were about to tell us?

01:45:01.225 --> 01:45:02.435
I'm married.

01:45:03.145 --> 01:45:04.738
That is terrible!

01:45:04.936 --> 01:45:05.930
Big deal.

01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:11.491
My wife and I both work hard. She
has a job, and I have two jobs.

01:45:12.616 --> 01:45:15.137
We've been saving money because
we want to have a family.

01:45:15.464 --> 01:45:17.537
A daughter or a son.

01:45:18.953 --> 01:45:21.538
For a year we've
worked at having a baby.

01:45:22.312 --> 01:45:24.451
Nice work if you can get it.

01:45:24.744 --> 01:45:27.166
Shut up and let him finish.

01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:30.342
Is that your wife?

01:45:30.792 --> 01:45:31.792
Yeah.

01:45:32.616 --> 01:45:33.617
Eija.

01:45:35.976 --> 01:45:39.489
Anyway, after a while
my wife became pregnant.

01:45:40.264 --> 01:45:43.711
We were so happy. My wife's
belly got bigger and bigger.

01:45:44.487 --> 01:45:47.389
Then, in the sixth month,
she started feeling strange

01:45:47.879 --> 01:45:50.050
so I took her to the
hospital right away.

01:45:52.104 --> 01:45:53.347
Was she all right?

01:45:54.183 --> 01:45:57.030
Well, I took her to the hospital
and they took her inside.

01:45:58.151 --> 01:46:00.868
I was worried, waiting
and waiting for hours.

01:46:02.312 --> 01:46:04.134
Finally the doctor came and told me

01:46:04.328 --> 01:46:06.270
that Eija had a baby.

01:46:07.112 --> 01:46:11.749
She was all right, and the
baby, a little girl, was alive.

01:46:12.775 --> 01:46:14.946
I was so happy I was about to explode.

01:46:15.783 --> 01:46:18.500
- A little daughter.
- Ya.

01:46:20.071 --> 01:46:21.827
But the doctor looked worried.

01:46:22.727 --> 01:46:24.930
He told me the baby was way too early.

01:46:26.086 --> 01:46:29.632
So far she was okay, but
she was in an incubator.

01:46:30.982 --> 01:46:32.192
And then he said

01:46:33.702 --> 01:46:36.288
there was almost no
chance the baby would live.

01:46:43.782 --> 01:46:45.026
So what happened?

01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:51.423
The next day I brought my
wife home from the hospital,

01:46:52.326 --> 01:46:54.814
but the baby stayed
there in the incubator.

01:46:56.582 --> 01:46:58.011
You should have seen her though.

01:46:59.494 --> 01:47:01.185
So tiny and perfect.

01:47:01.894 --> 01:47:03.901
Tiny hands, tiny feet.

01:47:05.702 --> 01:47:08.735
She was shaped like a little peanut.

01:47:15.301 --> 01:47:17.636
But the doctor didn't give us much hope.

01:47:18.565 --> 01:47:21.663
He said she wouldn't
live more than a week,

01:47:21.925 --> 01:47:23.452
our tiny daughter.

01:47:24.741 --> 01:47:27.458
Eija was so scared that
she was about to go crazy.

01:47:28.102 --> 01:47:29.508
So I made a big decision.

01:47:30.501 --> 01:47:33.665
I decided that I wouldn't
love this tiny little child.

01:47:34.789 --> 01:47:38.651
If she was going to die, I would
have to stay strong and distant.

01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:42.786
I couldn't stand the
pain of losing this child.

01:47:44.581 --> 01:47:47.483
So I decided to kill my love.

01:47:55.812 --> 01:47:58.747
A week went by, and the baby lived.

01:48:02.628 --> 01:48:06.206
Then another week went
by, and part of a third.

01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:10.751
After three entire weeks
the child was still alive.

01:48:11.428 --> 01:48:13.730
But the doctor was still very negative.

01:48:14.372 --> 01:48:16.161
That started to make me angry.

01:48:16.996 --> 01:48:19.265
I sat up all night in the kitchen

01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:21.820
while my poor wife lay
awake in the bedroom.

01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:26.943
And I sat there, just as
the dawn was about to break.

01:48:28.164 --> 01:48:30.782
The light outside was
just like it is right now.

01:48:32.196 --> 01:48:35.611
Then Eija came to me and
said I'd made a mistake.

01:48:36.995 --> 01:48:38.424
I realized she was right.

01:48:39.139 --> 01:48:42.522
If that baby was going to
make it, it needed all my love.

01:48:43.267 --> 01:48:44.958
The strongest love possible.

01:48:46.531 --> 01:48:47.992
It was a relief.

01:48:48.419 --> 01:48:55.359
I felt my love for that baby surge
through every pore of my worthless body.

01:48:58.435 --> 01:49:00.923
I felt so happy and clear.

01:49:02.083 --> 01:49:04.538
That little peanut was our child

01:49:05.987 --> 01:49:08.158
and we cried out of happiness.

01:49:09.123 --> 01:49:11.872
We tried to eat some
breakfast, but we couldn't.

01:49:15.523 --> 01:49:17.246
Then we drove to the hospital.

01:49:18.339 --> 01:49:21.950
We wanted that baby to feel
all the strength of our love.

01:49:25.794 --> 01:49:27.038
At the hospital

01:49:27.138 --> 01:49:29.277
the doctor was right there to meet us.

01:49:30.274 --> 01:49:32.128
His face was very serious.

01:49:32.962 --> 01:49:34.652
He took us aside.

01:49:37.058 --> 01:49:39.774
And then he told us that
a short time earlier,

01:49:39.874 --> 01:49:41.564
just before sunrise,

01:49:41.730 --> 01:49:43.224
the baby had died.

01:49:43.586 --> 01:49:47.710
Nothing could be done.
It was too late... 

01:50:07.873 --> 01:50:08.873
Hey.

01:50:10.017 --> 01:50:11.017
Don't worry.

01:50:12.001 --> 01:50:15.198
You and your wife can make another baby.

01:50:18.113 --> 01:50:20.186
Maybe we can, sometime.

01:50:23.713 --> 01:50:25.688
Such a sad story.

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:32.288
You're a good guy, Mika.

01:50:34.849 --> 01:50:36.441
Aki is so full of shit.

01:50:39.201 --> 01:50:41.786
His life isn't so terrible after all.

01:50:42.081 --> 01:50:44.894
He fuckin' whines
about such trivial shit.

01:50:44.994 --> 01:50:48.604
Some people have got real troubles.

01:50:52.224 --> 01:50:53.883
You're right, Mika.

01:50:57.312 --> 01:50:59.167
You're a good man.

01:51:02.944 --> 01:51:03.944
Hey.

01:51:05.248 --> 01:51:06.677
We're almost home.

01:51:07.872 --> 01:51:11.767
Take the next right, then
a left. That's our street.

01:51:12.928 --> 01:51:15.895
What about your friend? Is he okay now?

01:51:16.352 --> 01:51:17.310
Fuck him.

01:51:17.410 --> 01:51:18.458
Yeah, forget about him.

01:51:18.592 --> 01:51:20.829
What about his wife, and the big knife?

01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:23.641
What knife?

01:51:24.339 --> 01:51:26.648
Oh, that. Fuck it.

01:51:26.752 --> 01:51:31.837
He'll push his way into one of our
houses if he can't get into his own.

01:51:32.927 --> 01:51:34.553
He's a leech anyway.

01:52:38.814 --> 01:52:42.643
Don't worry. Everything
will be all right.

01:52:43.485 --> 01:52:47.414
Yeah. And send greetings
to your wife, Eija.

01:52:48.222 --> 01:52:50.197
Yeah, give her my best too.

01:53:58.588 --> 01:54:00.435
Hey. Aki.

01:54:01.243 --> 01:54:02.813
Wake up, Aki!

01:54:06.780 --> 01:54:08.307
Who the fuck are you?

01:54:10.204 --> 01:54:11.611
Where the fuck am I?

01:54:11.836 --> 01:54:15.032
You're in a fucking taxi,
near your fucking home

01:54:15.164 --> 01:54:17.171
and you owe me the fucking fare.

01:54:19.068 --> 01:54:23.803
Yeah, I know. Nothin' for free.

01:54:37.147 --> 01:54:38.147
Thanks.

01:54:52.763 --> 01:54:54.007
You all right?

01:54:57.819 --> 01:54:59.412
You know where you are?

01:55:00.891 --> 01:55:01.891
Yeah.

01:55:03.585 --> 01:55:04.628
Helsinki.

01:56:08.059 --> 01:56:09.170
Morning, Aki.

01:56:10.126 --> 01:56:11.153
Morning.

01:56:53.272 --> 01:56:55.955
<i>~ When I was a boy ~</i>

01:56:57.271 --> 01:57:00.468
<i>~ The moon was a pearl ~</i>

01:57:01.656 --> 01:57:05.584
<i>~ And the sun was a yellow gold ~</i>

01:57:07.895 --> 01:57:11.856
<i>~ But when I was a man ~</i>

01:57:13.239 --> 01:57:15.890
<i>~ The wind blew cold ~</i>

01:57:17.655 --> 01:57:21.812
<i>~ The hills were upside down ~</i>

01:57:23.575 --> 01:57:28.298
<i>~ Oh, now that I ~</i>

01:57:28.398 --> 01:57:31.890
<i>~ Have gone from here ~</i>

01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:34.323
<i>~ There's no place ~</i>

01:57:34.423 --> 01:57:38.925
<i>~ I'd rather be ~</i>

01:57:39.025 --> 01:57:45.121
<i>~ Than to float my chances ~</i>

01:57:45.221 --> 01:57:48.453
<i>~ On the tide ~</i>

01:57:48.553 --> 01:57:53.074
<i>~ Back in the good old world ~</i>

01:57:56.662 --> 01:57:59.510
<i>~ On October's last ~</i>

01:58:00.567 --> 01:58:03.567
<i>~ I'll fly back home ~</i>

01:58:05.111 --> 01:58:09.234
<i>~ Rolling down winding way ~</i>

01:58:13.013 --> 01:58:15.599
<i>~ And all I've got's ~</i>

01:58:15.701 --> 01:58:19.876
<i>~ A pocketful ~</i>

01:58:19.976 --> 01:58:26.350
<i>~ Of flowers on my grave ~</i>

01:58:27.190 --> 01:58:31.663
<i>~ But now summer is gone ~</i>

01:58:31.765 --> 01:58:35.954
<i>~ I remember it best ~</i>

01:58:36.054 --> 01:58:41.356
<i>~ Back in the good old world ~</i>

01:58:45.846 --> 01:58:47.985
<i>~ I remember when ~</i>

01:58:48.085 --> 01:58:51.499
<i>~ She held my hand ~</i>

01:58:53.205 --> 01:58:56.717
<i>~ We walked home alone in the rain ~</i>

01:58:59.221 --> 01:59:03.247
<i>~ How pretty her mouth ~</i>

01:59:03.348 --> 01:59:05.999
<i>~ How soft her hair ~</i>

01:59:08.852 --> 01:59:12.878
<i>~ Nothing can be the same ~</i>

01:59:14.676 --> 01:59:20.094
<i>~ And there's a rose ~</i>

01:59:20.194 --> 01:59:22.700
<i>~ Upon her breast ~</i>

01:59:22.804 --> 01:59:28.467
<i>~ Where I long to lay my head ~</i>

01:59:30.549 --> 01:59:34.859
<i>~ And her hair was so yellow ~</i>

01:59:34.964 --> 01:59:38.825
<i>~ And the wine was so red ~</i>

01:59:40.595 --> 01:59:44.905
<i>~ Back in the good old world ~</i>

01:59:48.948 --> 01:59:52.111
<i>~ There's a rose ~</i>

01:59:52.211 --> 01:59:55.146
