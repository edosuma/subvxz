on "Criminal Minds"...

00:06.468 --> 00:08.735
Yesterday, while we were in Florida,
a body was found in the desert

00:08.803 --> 00:10.604
outside Las Cruces, New Mexico.

00:10.671 --> 00:12.072
A man had his leg
amputated

00:12.140 --> 00:14.674
and replaced with
the leg of someone else.

00:14.742 --> 00:16.943
Someone's out there
mimicking the crimes we've solved.

00:17.011 --> 00:18.645
This is now
an active case,

00:18.713 --> 00:21.147
which we'll be investigating
along with our other cases.

00:21.215 --> 00:22.582
Hello. I'm still here.

00:22.649 --> 00:24.117
Zug...Zwang.

00:24.184 --> 00:26.152
It's a chess term.
It describes the point in the game

00:26.220 --> 00:29.288
when a player realizes
he'll inevitably be checkmated.

00:29.356 --> 00:31.690
Guess what just came
to the reception desk

00:31.758 --> 00:32.958
for an Agent Jennifer Jareau.

00:33.026 --> 00:33.959
Zugzwang.

00:34.027 --> 00:35.161
Who sent it?

00:35.229 --> 00:36.762
They knew you would be
at that phone booth,

00:36.830 --> 00:38.097
which means
they were stalking you.

00:38.164 --> 00:40.365
Or us. What if this
is the Replicator?

00:40.433 --> 00:41.900
The original zugzwang call
was directed at me.

00:41.968 --> 00:44.536
If it's directed at one of us,
it's directed at all of us.

00:44.604 --> 00:46.905
So far he's committed
3 murders in 3 different states.

00:46.973 --> 00:48.440
If the Replicator's still out there,
then this whole thing

00:48.508 --> 00:49.988
is part of a much
bigger manipulation.

00:50.043 --> 00:52.845
First he was chasing us,
and now it's our turn to chase him.

01:04.422 --> 01:06.223
This doesn't make
any sense.

01:06.291 --> 01:08.826
How in the hell did
he get so much access?

01:08.894 --> 01:10.093
Yeah, thank you.

01:10.161 --> 01:12.763
Winslow, Arizona, P.D.
statewide system security check

01:12.830 --> 01:14.464
reports no breaches.

01:14.532 --> 01:15.799
They were the last.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.601
If the Replicator
isn't hacking in,

01:18.670 --> 01:21.038
how is he learning details
of these crimes.

01:21.105 --> 01:22.372
Maybe it's a journalist.

01:22.439 --> 01:24.841
They're skilled at obtaining
confidential information.

01:24.909 --> 01:27.710
But why not help out
his career in the process?

01:27.778 --> 01:29.663
The media didn't know

01:29.688 --> 01:32.335
that Adam Rain was making
human marionettes,

01:32.382 --> 01:34.150
but somehow the Replicator did.

01:34.217 --> 01:35.823
He's been watching us
for months.

01:35.848 --> 01:37.566
Maybe we were
the only source he needed.

01:37.567 --> 01:39.502
That would require him to be
in two places at the same time.

01:39.505 --> 01:42.126
I've assembled a pretty accurate
timetable of the unsub's

01:42.151 --> 01:44.649
stalking and murder activities,
and based on the estimated

01:44.652 --> 01:47.012
time of death regarding
our amputated replication,

01:47.112 --> 01:49.379
the unsub wasn't stalking us
during the investigation

01:49.447 --> 01:51.215
of the Whitewood-Turner
crimes in Miami

01:51.283 --> 01:53.217
because he was dumping
his victim in New Mexico.

01:53.285 --> 01:55.719
Yet, he was still back in D.C.
in time to see me

01:55.787 --> 01:58.422
hit my game-winning home run
against the Secret Service.

01:58.489 --> 02:01.157
Baby girl,
this the best you got?

02:01.225 --> 02:03.392
I'm blowing it up
as much as I can.

02:03.460 --> 02:04.427
What about this?

02:04.494 --> 02:08.131
Look at the reflection
in Blake's glasses.

02:08.199 --> 02:11.167
It's grainy, but it looks like
some creep taking pictures.

02:11.235 --> 02:14.003
You know, we've got all of this
and the best we can tell

02:14.071 --> 02:15.738
is this guy
has a blue baseball cap.

02:15.806 --> 02:16.712
I know and I'm sorry.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.810
I promise I will be home
before you guys wake up.

02:19.576 --> 02:21.143
Well, the sooner
we get this guy,

02:21.211 --> 02:23.479
the sooner the security
detail can go away.

02:23.547 --> 02:26.181
Ok. Well, we're trying.

02:26.249 --> 02:28.651
I love you.

02:28.719 --> 02:30.085
Erin, what are you
doing here so late?

02:30.153 --> 02:31.553
I had a meeting
with the Director.

02:31.620 --> 02:33.722
I thought we were going
to brief him in the morning.

02:33.789 --> 02:35.022
You were. He canceled.

02:35.090 --> 02:36.424
You have
no fresh leads.

02:36.492 --> 02:38.493
He wants the Replicator
classified inactive.

02:38.561 --> 02:39.894
All due respect, ma'am,

02:39.962 --> 02:42.322
but this guy's hardly inactive.
He's planning his next move.

02:42.365 --> 02:44.606
And when he makes that move,
you'll be there to stop him.

02:44.667 --> 02:46.033
How many times
have you told me

02:46.101 --> 02:48.569
that sometimes the best
thing to do is wait,

02:48.636 --> 02:50.671
each crime teaches you
something new?

02:50.739 --> 02:51.938
The Replicator is dormant.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.574
You're not learning
anything new.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.209
All you're doing is working
yourselves to death

02:56.277 --> 02:58.211
and ignoring the cases
that need your attention.

02:58.279 --> 03:01.482
Erin, he's stalking this team.
No one's gonna give it up.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.850
I know that.
And neither will I.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.318
But the cases are piling up
and they need to be cleared

03:06.387 --> 03:07.774
so the Director no longer thinks

03:07.799 --> 03:10.208
that his best unit
is dropping the ball.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.159
So, go home.

03:14.227 --> 03:16.396
Start fresh tomorrow.

03:18.331 --> 03:20.231
I hate to admit it,
but she's right.

03:20.299 --> 03:22.280
I'm sure there's some other
psychopath out there

03:22.305 --> 03:23.402
planning his next attack.

03:23.403 --> 03:27.305
All right, go get some rest.
Back in here by 8:00.

03:30.676 --> 03:34.045
Will, change of plans.

03:36.515 --> 03:38.181
Hey.

03:38.249 --> 03:40.684
Hey. Hey, Nikki.

03:40.752 --> 03:42.286
Nikki, come on.

03:43.922 --> 03:45.255
Where are you going?

03:45.323 --> 03:47.958
I can't do this anymore.
It's never just one drink.

03:48.026 --> 03:49.387
- Oh, come on.
- I'm tired of this.

03:49.428 --> 03:50.549
All right. Fine.
Just give me

03:50.562 --> 03:52.028
a second to close up
and we'll head home.

03:52.095 --> 03:54.464
I'm going home alone.

03:54.532 --> 03:55.865
You're not going anywhere.

03:55.933 --> 03:57.199
This conversation is over.

03:57.267 --> 03:58.468
Let go of me!

03:58.536 --> 03:59.736
I'm not gonna lose you.

03:59.804 --> 04:01.971
- Let her go, John.
- Who the hell are you?

04:02.039 --> 04:03.573
Get off me.

04:03.641 --> 04:05.909
You got two choices--
you can leave

04:05.976 --> 04:07.810
or I can beat the hell
out of you right now.

04:07.877 --> 04:10.011
Ok. Ok!

04:10.079 --> 04:13.982
You know what?
You're not worth it.

04:14.050 --> 04:15.216
You want her so bad,

04:15.284 --> 04:17.553
you can have her.

04:18.620 --> 04:20.322
Walk away, John.

04:23.992 --> 04:25.593
Thank you.

04:25.661 --> 04:26.761
You all right?

04:26.829 --> 04:28.429
I'm fine. I just
want to go home.

04:28.497 --> 04:30.565
You shouldn't have to
put up with that.

04:30.632 --> 04:32.834
Oh, he's not normally
like this. He just...

04:32.901 --> 04:34.335
had too much to drink.

04:34.402 --> 04:36.737
It's nice to finally
meet you, Nicole.

04:36.805 --> 04:40.006
How do you know my name?

04:40.074 --> 04:42.075
What are you doing?

04:42.142 --> 04:43.477
Stop it!

04:58.024 --> 04:59.692
I almost knocked you--

04:59.759 --> 05:00.960
Sam?

05:01.027 --> 05:02.928
Penelope.

05:02.996 --> 05:04.630
What are you doing
in my 'hood?

05:04.698 --> 05:05.998
3-day seminar.

05:06.065 --> 05:08.166
I decided to skip
the schmoozing over breakfast.

05:08.234 --> 05:11.470
Yeah, you never did
have much patience for small talk.

05:11.538 --> 05:13.038
Do you need a hand?

05:13.106 --> 05:14.672
Uh...

05:14.740 --> 05:16.308
Uh, Sam, this is Kevin.

05:16.376 --> 05:17.976
We work together.
Kevin, this is Sam.

05:18.044 --> 05:19.844
We... went on
a couple of dates.

05:19.912 --> 05:20.879
It was more than
a couple dates.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.248
Nice to meet you.

05:26.519 --> 05:29.720
So how are the ukulele
lessons going?

05:29.787 --> 05:30.787
Ukulele lessons?

05:30.855 --> 05:32.890
- Two months strong.
- Two months strong?

05:32.957 --> 05:34.597
You'll have to give me
a concert sometime.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.927
Medium latte,
light foam, extra soy.

05:36.995 --> 05:38.562
Uh-huh. That's you.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.064
Good memory.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.999
Listen, we should catch up.

05:42.067 --> 05:43.334
Uh-huh. We should.

05:43.402 --> 05:45.836
Perfect.
Nice to meet you, Kenneth.

05:45.904 --> 05:47.704
Kevin.

05:49.273 --> 05:51.207
Did you know
that soy milk

05:51.275 --> 05:53.343
contains high levels
of phytoestrogen,

05:53.411 --> 05:56.346
which mimics the functions
of estrogen inside humans?

05:56.414 --> 05:58.849
I'm just saying
he's gonna have moobs.

05:58.917 --> 05:59.850
What are moobs?

05:59.918 --> 06:01.250
Man boobs.

06:06.456 --> 06:07.389
Go ahead, Garcia.

06:07.457 --> 06:08.658
Yes, sir. Ok.

06:08.725 --> 06:10.426
So, over the past
couple of days,

06:10.493 --> 06:12.028
two woman have
been found murdered

06:12.095 --> 06:14.163
with their tongues removed

06:14.230 --> 06:15.998
in St. Paul, Minnesota.

06:16.066 --> 06:17.666
The first is Patricia Morris.

06:17.733 --> 06:20.035
She was found at a local park
by a couple of joggers.

06:20.102 --> 06:21.663
And then a few hours ago
Nicole Francis,

06:21.671 --> 06:24.039
she was found in a parking lot
of a local restaurant.

06:24.106 --> 06:26.841
Both women died from
multiple stab wounds.

06:26.909 --> 06:28.109
Had they been
reported missing?

06:28.177 --> 06:29.544
No. In fact, local P.D.
were the ones

06:29.612 --> 06:31.012
who initially informed
the families.

06:31.047 --> 06:32.980
The M.O. is specific.
Anything on ViCAP?

06:33.048 --> 06:34.414
Nothing yet,
but I'm still searching.

06:34.482 --> 06:36.149
Well, he definitely wasn't
trying to hide the bodies.

06:36.217 --> 06:38.085
They were left in very
public places.

06:38.152 --> 06:39.419
Either he wanted them
found quickly

06:39.487 --> 06:41.455
or he's all about the act
and not the clean-up.

06:41.522 --> 06:43.290
Any witnesses?

06:43.357 --> 06:44.224
Yeah, sort of.

06:44.249 --> 06:46.060
Nicole was last seen
at the restaurant

06:46.061 --> 06:47.494
with her boyfriend
John Butler.

06:47.562 --> 06:48.728
They had some sort
of icky spat.

06:48.796 --> 06:50.329
Then he's on the short list.

06:50.397 --> 06:52.298
No, he isn't. He actually
has a solid alibi.

06:52.365 --> 06:53.399
Eh, liquid.

06:53.467 --> 06:54.907
He was drinking
at the bar all night.

06:54.969 --> 06:56.736
Right after he left,
local P.D. picked him up

06:56.804 --> 06:58.270
for public intoxication
and they're holding him,

06:58.338 --> 07:00.473
but it's just until
he sobers up.

07:00.540 --> 07:01.407
Ok, it takes
a lot of strength

07:01.475 --> 07:02.942
to rip out someone's tongue.

07:03.010 --> 07:05.510
It's one of the strongest
muscles in the body.

07:05.578 --> 07:06.778
The M.E. is still
trying to determine

07:06.846 --> 07:08.279
whether it was done
ante- or postmortem.

07:08.347 --> 07:09.948
According to Chinese mythology,

07:10.016 --> 07:12.217
one of the most dreadful
punishments in the 18 levels of hell

07:12.284 --> 07:13.885
involves having one's
tongue ripped out.

07:13.953 --> 07:16.054
It's considered to be one of
the most horrific forms of torture.

07:16.122 --> 07:18.123
It's also symbolic,
used to punish liars

07:18.190 --> 07:19.658
and anti-regime activists.

07:19.726 --> 07:21.692
The very nature
of the M.O. is overkill.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.794
We can't rule out
a personal vendetta.

07:23.862 --> 07:25.395
These women may have had
something on this unsub

07:25.463 --> 07:28.733
and he wanted to make sure
that they didn't live to talk about it.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.835
Wheels up in 30.

07:57.761 --> 08:00.530
Laurel loves to play
hard-to-get.

08:00.597 --> 08:05.868
But I knew at night she'd
leave that one window open...

08:07.804 --> 08:09.538
just for me.

08:15.211 --> 08:18.846
It was her special invitation
to come and play...

08:22.185 --> 08:25.252
Our very own game...

08:28.823 --> 08:30.391
of hide and seek.

08:32.660 --> 08:36.297
She wanted me to find her.

08:36.364 --> 08:38.465
And once I did...

08:41.235 --> 08:43.436
I was never
going to let her go.

Barbara Grizzuti Harrison
once said,

"all acts performed in the world
begin in the imagination."

09:29.292 --> 09:31.961
The preliminary
toxicology report

09:32.028 --> 09:34.629
suggests neither woman
was drugged.

09:34.697 --> 09:37.265
No sign of a struggle
or that he used restraints.

09:37.333 --> 09:39.167
Both women suffered
solid blows to the head.

09:39.235 --> 09:40.422
Probably how he subdued them.

09:40.423 --> 09:42.524
Neither victim showed
signs of sexual assault.

09:42.592 --> 09:43.959
Maybe he's impotent.

09:44.026 --> 09:46.395
Or sadistic. The stabbing
could be what's getting him off.

09:46.463 --> 09:47.730
I have looked into
both of the victims.

09:47.797 --> 09:49.431
The only thing they have in common
are the same zip code.

09:49.499 --> 09:52.166
They have different occupations,
interests, hobbies.

09:52.234 --> 09:53.834
Patricia was
a pilates instructor,

09:53.902 --> 09:55.637
and Nicole
was a legal assistant.

09:55.704 --> 09:56.837
Both were low risk.

09:56.905 --> 09:58.673
He could just be
picking them at random.

09:58.741 --> 10:00.341
If his primary motive
is to kill,

10:00.409 --> 10:01.839
it explains why he didn't
take either of his victims

10:01.864 --> 10:03.110
to a secondary location.

10:03.111 --> 10:04.612
But what take
such a huge risk?

10:04.680 --> 10:06.080
Both crime scenes
have tons of foot traffic.

10:06.148 --> 10:07.581
Someone could have
interrupted him.

10:07.649 --> 10:10.183
Oh, boy. Local P.D.
just discovered two bodies.

10:10.251 --> 10:13.453
Laurel Tyson, 25,
and her brother Daryl, 28.

10:13.521 --> 10:15.255
They were both stabbed
to death inside her house.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.823
Attacking in the home
hasn't been his M.O.

10:16.891 --> 10:18.592
Up until now they've all been
very public places.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.827
Two attacks on
3 victims in one night.

10:20.895 --> 10:22.929
This is the first time
he's killed a male.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.196
Is this turning into a spree?

10:24.264 --> 10:25.625
Garcia, were their
tongues missing?

10:25.666 --> 10:28.601
Uh, Laurel's was.
Daryl's was still intact.

10:28.669 --> 10:29.769
If this is a spree,

10:29.836 --> 10:31.704
why is he taking time
to collect souvenirs?

10:31.772 --> 10:35.107
Garcia, expand your ViCAP
search nationwide.

10:35.175 --> 10:36.776
The ritual of the tongue
extraction

10:36.843 --> 10:38.944
seems to be
what matters most to him.

10:39.012 --> 10:40.378
Detective Boseman.
Thanks for coming out.

10:40.446 --> 10:43.080
Thanks for having us.
I'm Dr. Reid. This is Agent Morgan.

10:43.148 --> 10:44.403
Nice to meet you.

10:44.428 --> 10:45.684
According to neighbors,
somebody noticed

10:45.685 --> 10:48.219
an open window early this morning
and alerted authorities.

10:48.287 --> 10:50.388
Nothing violates
one's sense of security

10:50.456 --> 10:53.525
more than being attacked
in their own home.

10:53.592 --> 10:56.226
Why didn't the alarm trigger
when the window was opened?

10:56.294 --> 10:57.561
That's a good question.

10:57.629 --> 10:59.095
Maybe he knew
what he was doing.

10:59.163 --> 11:00.631
Excuse me.

11:00.699 --> 11:02.899
Hey, give it to me good,
baby girl.

11:02.967 --> 11:05.202
Unfortunately, all I have
are daily coffee receipts

11:05.269 --> 11:08.097
and weekly Thai orders.
Laurel didn't get out much.

11:08.099 --> 11:09.879
She worked from home
as a telemarketer,

11:09.965 --> 11:11.866
spent a lot of time
surfing the web.

11:11.933 --> 11:14.268
Her most recent splurge
was a last-minute plane ticket

11:14.335 --> 11:15.669
for her brother.

11:16.904 --> 11:19.373
Garcia, when did Laurel
have the alarm installed?

11:19.440 --> 11:20.974
Two weeks ago.

11:21.041 --> 11:23.343
She lived here 3 years
and didn't feel the urge

11:23.411 --> 11:25.211
to install an alarm
until now.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.880
Thanks, mama.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.547
Mm-hmm.

11:28.615 --> 11:30.048
Maybe she flew him out here
because she was scared.

11:30.116 --> 11:32.418
Having her brother around would
make her feel more protected.

11:32.486 --> 11:33.452
And if Laurel
was the target,

11:33.520 --> 11:34.853
then Daryl's presence
would have come

11:34.921 --> 11:36.121
as a surprise
to the unsub.

11:36.189 --> 11:37.423
Making him a victim
of circumstance.

11:37.491 --> 11:39.358
The question is, how do you learn
about 3 separate women

11:39.426 --> 11:42.127
that lived 3 completely
different lives?

11:44.630 --> 11:46.798
Your report mentioned
you found rust fragments

11:46.865 --> 11:48.199
in the victims'
stomachs.

11:48.267 --> 11:49.701
Have you been able
to determine

11:49.769 --> 11:51.202
if they were
from the knife?

11:51.270 --> 11:52.737
Either that or from
the other object.

11:52.805 --> 11:53.871
Other object?

11:53.939 --> 11:55.707
The assailant used
two weapons,

11:55.775 --> 11:58.543
one to grip and the knife
to severe the tongue.

11:58.611 --> 12:01.178
Something like pliers.

12:01.245 --> 12:05.015
Well, that's new, isn't it?

12:05.082 --> 12:07.618
She was the only one
with this type of bruising.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.787
I'm still doing
tissue samples.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.690
All 3 women had copious
amounts of blood

12:12.757 --> 12:15.125
in both their lungs
and their stomachs.

12:17.160 --> 12:20.262
They were still alive when
their tongues were cut out.

12:23.066 --> 12:26.068
I'm really sorry
about Nicole.

12:26.136 --> 12:29.104
Can you tell me what you
remember from last night?

12:30.574 --> 12:33.342
Nicole got a raise
a few days ago.

12:33.409 --> 12:35.944
So I wanted to take her out
to celebrate.

12:36.011 --> 12:38.447
We started drinking,

12:38.514 --> 12:39.715
me more than her.

12:39.782 --> 12:42.250
Sometimes
people overdrink

12:42.318 --> 12:44.720
in an attempt
to mask their pain.

12:46.288 --> 12:48.856
Were you and Nicole
having relationship problems?

12:49.991 --> 12:52.993
We hadn't been on
the same page for a while.

12:53.061 --> 12:54.562
She'd just gotten
a great promotion

12:54.629 --> 12:57.097
and I was laid off
a few months back.

12:57.165 --> 13:00.234
Is that why the two of you decided
to move in together last month?

13:00.301 --> 13:04.871
In theory
it was a perfect idea.

13:04.938 --> 13:07.006
Till the issue of money
came up.

13:08.208 --> 13:11.043
Was that how the argument
started last night?

13:13.414 --> 13:15.982
She complained about
how much I was drinking.

13:16.049 --> 13:17.116
She stormed out
of the restaurant.

13:17.184 --> 13:18.150
Hey, Nikki.

13:18.218 --> 13:19.486
I followed her
into the parking lot.

13:19.553 --> 13:20.552
Nikki, come on.

13:20.620 --> 13:21.987
And the next thing I know,

13:22.054 --> 13:23.989
some guy is slamming me
into the car.

13:24.056 --> 13:25.223
Get off me!

13:25.291 --> 13:26.558
Do you think
you could describe him?

13:26.626 --> 13:27.993
Did you see his face?

13:29.996 --> 13:33.331
I was drunk.
I wasn't thinking straight.

13:35.935 --> 13:37.802
It's my fault.

13:37.870 --> 13:41.105
I never should have
left her out there.

13:41.172 --> 13:44.375
You want her so bad,
you can have her.

13:44.443 --> 13:48.012
I figured he was someone
she knew.

13:48.079 --> 13:50.147
Why would you think that?

13:50.215 --> 13:52.316
Walk away. John.

13:52.384 --> 13:53.950
Because he knew my name.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.188
Go ahead, Garcia.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.725
Sir, I did premium
spelunking on these 3 women

14:01.793 --> 14:04.227
and they were super duper
active online,

14:04.295 --> 14:07.731
I mean chat rooms, blog, Twitter,
Pinterest, Facebook, you name it.

14:07.799 --> 14:09.698
That could be how the unsub
knew about John Butler.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.246
Patricia was on multiple
dating sites.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.468
And Laurel?

14:12.536 --> 14:14.703
Oh, Laurel.
She had a blog

14:14.771 --> 14:17.139
that makes "50 Shades of Grey"
read like a children's book.

14:17.206 --> 14:19.308
It sounds like that's how
he knew these women.

14:19.375 --> 14:20.709
Thanks, Garcia.

14:30.385 --> 14:32.987
Is that work-related
or personal?

14:34.723 --> 14:35.890
Hello!

14:35.958 --> 14:37.926
Peter, I asked you
a question.

14:37.993 --> 14:40.294
Is that personal
or work-related?

14:41.395 --> 14:42.362
Aah!

14:42.430 --> 14:44.264
Is everything all right?

14:44.332 --> 14:46.199
I'm sorry, what?

14:46.267 --> 14:48.435
Are you coming to the staff
potluck tomorrow?

14:48.503 --> 14:49.870
Yeah, I'll be there.

14:49.938 --> 14:52.305
Sure you're ok?

14:52.373 --> 14:54.541
Fine.

15:00.747 --> 15:02.014
Anything?

15:02.082 --> 15:04.517
Well, these women
practically lived online.

15:04.585 --> 15:06.752
Their posts went up
5, 6 times an hour.

15:06.820 --> 15:11.190
"Brian used his own toilet
for the first time today."

15:11.257 --> 15:13.124
All right,
cut her some slack.

15:13.192 --> 15:15.727
She's excited.
Her son is potty-trained.

15:15.795 --> 15:18.396
Brian is her cocker spaniel.

15:18.464 --> 15:20.732
Hmm. Check this out.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.501
At 1:14, Nicole posted
a status update

15:22.568 --> 15:24.636
saying she's waiting
for somebody to rescue her

15:24.704 --> 15:26.270
from a loveless
relationship.

15:26.338 --> 15:28.539
I assume she's referring
to her and John.

15:28.607 --> 15:30.474
On 1-8, Patricia tweeted,

15:30.542 --> 15:33.978
quote, "Saw one of the most
beautiful oak trees

15:34.045 --> 15:36.580
"in the park. I wish I could just
take a nap under it

15:36.648 --> 15:39.817
like I did when
I was a little girl." End quote.

15:39.885 --> 15:42.419
On 2-18, Laurel posted
on her personal blog

15:42.487 --> 15:43.921
about how much
she likes pain.

15:43.989 --> 15:47.124
She describes it as,
"the best foreplay."

15:47.191 --> 15:49.126
Then on 2-21,
again Laurel posts,

15:49.193 --> 15:51.594
talking about a fantasy where
someone climbs through the window

15:51.662 --> 15:52.996
and ravishes her with bondage.

15:53.064 --> 15:55.932
That's exactly how the unsub
entered her house--

15:56.000 --> 15:57.600
through
the living room window.

15:57.668 --> 16:00.170
Laurel was the only one
with ligature marks.

16:00.238 --> 16:02.138
He knew
she was into S&M.

16:02.205 --> 16:04.507
Technically, the unsub's
the one that rescued Nicole

16:04.574 --> 16:06.108
from the argument she was
having with her boyfriend.

16:06.176 --> 16:08.109
He was the one
that whisked her away.

16:08.177 --> 16:12.180
And the first victim, Patricia,
was found in a local park under a tree.

16:12.248 --> 16:15.250
So these women unknowingly
described their own murders.

16:41.508 --> 16:43.443
This guy targeted these women
through their online activity?

16:43.510 --> 16:46.712
In the unsub's mind, their posts
created a connection to him,

16:46.780 --> 16:48.548
which led to
the initial stalking.

16:51.218 --> 16:54.120
That tells us he's most
likely socially awkward.

17:00.226 --> 17:01.215
And his online surveillance

17:01.240 --> 17:03.053
allowed him to build
confidence over time.

17:06.465 --> 17:09.233
It's likely these women don't
know what the unsub looks like,

17:09.301 --> 17:11.182
making it possible
for him to interact with them

17:11.237 --> 17:12.769
without revealing
his true identity.

17:12.837 --> 17:14.938
What his victims considered
pure fantasy,

17:15.006 --> 17:18.209
the unsub interpreted as
literal and open invitation.

17:18.276 --> 17:21.444
That compulsion is specific
to his psychopathology.

17:21.512 --> 17:23.247
If he's getting these
readings on the web,

17:23.315 --> 17:25.949
his next inspiration
could come from anywhere.

17:34.057 --> 17:38.495
Kayla ignored me, pretended
like I wasn't even there.

17:40.131 --> 17:43.299
Time after time
she'd walk by me...

17:45.201 --> 17:48.237
Never acknowledging
my presence.

17:48.304 --> 17:50.272
Did she even know I existed?

17:50.340 --> 17:52.974
She was going
to learn tonight.

17:58.148 --> 18:00.915
No matter what,

18:00.983 --> 18:04.119
she was finally
going to see me.

18:04.186 --> 18:05.754
Aah!

18:05.821 --> 18:07.221
Aah! No!

18:07.289 --> 18:10.058
And I wanted to make sure

18:10.126 --> 18:11.893
that my face...

18:13.195 --> 18:17.531
was the last one...

18:17.598 --> 18:20.134
she'd ever see.

18:30.328 --> 18:32.762
The victim was
Kayla Jefferson, 19,

18:32.829 --> 18:34.301
local college student.

18:34.302 --> 18:35.469
She lives
on the third floor.

18:35.536 --> 18:38.305
A neighbor
discovered her body.

18:38.373 --> 18:39.973
His ritual
remained the same,

18:40.040 --> 18:43.744
even though his M.O. changed
from stabbing to strangulation.

18:43.811 --> 18:45.245
We'll have Garcia
check her Internet history.

18:45.313 --> 18:47.981
Well, why didn't he kill her
the same way he killed the others?

18:48.048 --> 18:50.583
He must have been inspired
by a new fantasy.

18:50.651 --> 18:53.153
We're ready to deliver
the profile.

18:53.220 --> 18:56.220
We're looking for a fit, aggressive,
Caucasian male in his mid- to late 30s.

18:56.257 --> 18:59.159
He's practicing  what's called
vicarious fantasy assimilation.

18:59.226 --> 19:01.761
This refers to the cathartic
release that comes

19:01.829 --> 19:04.349
when he turns someone else's
thoughts or fantasies into reality.

19:04.363 --> 19:06.338
He trolls the Internet
and is selecting women

19:06.363 --> 19:08.677
with a strong online presence
and who frequently post

19:08.679 --> 19:10.545
their fantasies
with descriptive detail.

19:10.568 --> 19:12.358
There are two levels
to his M.O.,

19:12.359 --> 19:13.692
the first being
the enjoyment he gets

19:13.759 --> 19:15.360
from taking one of his
victim's fantasies

19:15.362 --> 19:17.529
and turning it
into a nightmare.

19:17.597 --> 19:20.264
Once he establishes his dominance
by subverting that fantasy,

19:20.332 --> 19:21.799
then he moves on
to step two,

19:21.867 --> 19:23.468
which is removing
the tongue.

19:29.774 --> 19:31.075
His M.O. is polymorphic.

19:31.143 --> 19:32.843
It's taken on different forms.

19:32.911 --> 19:35.479
However, his ritual
never changes.

19:45.623 --> 19:47.391
Oh, I am so sorry.

19:47.458 --> 19:49.226
It's ok.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.936
It's likely that there are other women
he's already targeted,

20:01.004 --> 20:05.374
so be vigilant if there are
any reports of suspicious behavior.

20:05.442 --> 20:06.808
Thank you.

20:06.876 --> 20:09.644
This is Alicia Danner
reporting live to you

20:09.711 --> 20:12.647
from outside the 13th
Street apartment building,

20:12.714 --> 20:14.649
where the body of
a local college student

20:14.716 --> 20:18.019
has just been identified
as Kayla Jefferson.

20:18.087 --> 20:20.929
Police are also releasing
the names and photos

20:20.954 --> 20:21.622
of the other 4 victims

20:21.623 --> 20:23.690
No, no, no.
who were brutally murdered

20:23.758 --> 20:25.225
during the recent
strain of attacks.

20:25.293 --> 20:28.429
The FBI is asking anyone with
information about this case

20:28.496 --> 20:31.865
to contact the taskforce
hotline shown on your screen.

20:31.933 --> 20:35.902
Patricia, Nicole, Laurel--

20:35.970 --> 20:38.038
those are my girls.
These are my stories.

20:38.106 --> 20:40.373
My stories.

21:22.280 --> 21:26.383
So, Sam--
he seemed like a nice guy.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.652
Yeah. He--he is.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.554
Ricky D.
He was a nice guy, too.

21:31.623 --> 21:32.623
Who's Ricky d.?

21:32.690 --> 21:34.324
My college roommate.

21:34.391 --> 21:36.493
Drank coffee from sunup
to sundown.

21:36.560 --> 21:37.828
Spent 4 years with the guy,

21:37.895 --> 21:40.330
and I never once remembered
how he took his coffee.

21:40.397 --> 21:41.832
You lost me at Ricky.

21:41.899 --> 21:44.900
I thought you said you guys
just went on a couple dates.

21:44.968 --> 21:46.910
That's what this is about,

21:46.935 --> 21:48.545
that I know what Sam
puts in his coffee?

21:49.973 --> 21:52.708
Might I remind you that
whose coffee order I memorize

21:52.776 --> 21:55.845
is no longer
any of your business.

21:55.912 --> 21:57.346
I--I just thought--

21:58.882 --> 22:03.317
You and I will
finish this later.

22:03.385 --> 22:04.786
Yeah.

22:04.854 --> 22:07.688
So Kayla was not at all
into modern technology.

22:07.756 --> 22:09.422
I mean, she didn't even
own a computer,

22:09.490 --> 22:10.991
so that means
there's no Facebook,

22:11.059 --> 22:13.060
no Twitter, no blogs,
no nothing.

22:13.128 --> 22:16.563
She never even activated
her college email account.

22:16.631 --> 22:18.932
Well, if she doesn't fit his pattern,
how do you know about here?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.968
Good question,
chocolate thunder.

22:21.036 --> 22:21.980
I did a search on Kayla's name

22:22.005 --> 22:24.005
and it turns out
she had a scary admirer.

22:24.038 --> 22:24.971
What do you mean?

22:25.039 --> 22:26.172
I mean that
a 16-year-old boy

22:26.239 --> 22:28.240
named Tyler Rogers
dedicated a blog to her.

22:28.308 --> 22:30.543
He had a lot of interesting
things to say on it.

22:30.610 --> 22:33.046
He lived in the same
apartment building as Kayla.

22:33.113 --> 22:34.580
Lived?

22:34.648 --> 22:36.182
Yeah. He was institutionalized
early January

22:36.249 --> 22:37.816
for attacking his mother.

22:37.884 --> 22:40.585
That can't be our guy.
He's been locked up for months.

22:40.653 --> 22:42.954
But we should still talk to him.
He might be able to give us something.

22:43.022 --> 22:44.990
Let's get Reid on it.

22:45.058 --> 22:47.125
Thanks, Garcia.

22:49.095 --> 22:51.362
"My fingers tightened
around her throat.

22:51.430 --> 22:55.365
I could feel her heartbeat
pulsing under my fingertips."

22:55.433 --> 22:57.735
When did you write this?

22:57.803 --> 23:01.906
Sunday, December 15,
2012, 4:14 p.m.

23:01.973 --> 23:04.608
Did Kayla do something
to upset you?

23:04.676 --> 23:06.744
She ignored me.

23:06.812 --> 23:08.579
Again.

23:08.646 --> 23:10.880
And that made you
want to kill her?

23:13.918 --> 23:15.785
You're funny.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.887
Your move.

23:17.955 --> 23:20.389
Tyler, Kayla is dead.

23:21.892 --> 23:24.127
Someone took one of
the stories you wrote

23:24.195 --> 23:26.895
and made it real.

23:27.831 --> 23:29.898
Was there a lot of blood?

23:29.966 --> 23:32.772
Your blog went into
great detail about how

23:32.797 --> 23:33.635
you wanted to kill her.

23:33.636 --> 23:36.471
Now, I need to know,
did you discuss this with anyone?

23:36.539 --> 23:39.241
With people on story swap,
yeah.

23:58.960 --> 24:02.495
So story swap allows you
to download stories from other people.

24:02.563 --> 24:04.731
Are they all about murder?

24:04.799 --> 24:06.432
Most of them.

24:06.500 --> 24:10.637
But, you know, there was
something for everyone.

24:10.704 --> 24:14.006
Rape and torture...

24:14.074 --> 24:16.142
Thanks for your help.

24:16.209 --> 24:17.910
Do you have any pictures

24:17.978 --> 24:21.147
of, uh, Kayla's body?

24:21.214 --> 24:25.050
Just wondered. I just want
to see what he did to her.

24:26.552 --> 24:29.021
Unfortunately,
Tyler's still struggling,

24:29.089 --> 24:31.189
but a number of clinical
studies have proven

24:31.257 --> 24:33.691
that a person experiences
the same neurochemical release

24:33.759 --> 24:36.560
from the simple act of documenting
a fantasy or a violent act.

24:36.628 --> 24:38.496
No offense, Dr. Houston,

24:38.563 --> 24:42.466
but isn't this therapy intended
to help traumatized victims,

24:42.534 --> 24:44.068
not perpetrators?

24:44.136 --> 24:45.969
While writing therapy
as applied to offenders

24:46.037 --> 24:49.506
may be somewhat controversial,
it's proven to be very effective

24:49.573 --> 24:51.175
if done properly.

24:51.242 --> 24:52.810
What do you mean
by properly?

24:52.877 --> 24:56.379
Well, I believe there are two phases
to this type of treatment.

24:56.447 --> 24:58.415
Having the patient
document the fantasy,

24:58.482 --> 25:01.185
then having them acknowledge
the shame and the guilt.

25:01.252 --> 25:03.519
If this treatment
is so important to you,

25:03.586 --> 25:05.387
why did you take
your name off it?

25:05.455 --> 25:07.723
I cut ties when I learned
many of the facilities

25:07.791 --> 25:09.926
weren't implementing
the second phase.

25:09.993 --> 25:12.061
What were they doing
instead?

25:12.129 --> 25:14.797
They were allowing the patients
to focus more on their fantasies

25:14.865 --> 25:17.499
without discussing
the root of the problem.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.973
Was Tyler able
to give you anything?

25:25.041 --> 25:27.001
So it turns out he was
part of an online community

25:27.043 --> 25:30.511
that exchanged psychopathic
stories while remaining anonymous.

25:30.579 --> 25:31.913
It's probably
where the unsub

25:31.981 --> 25:33.715
learned about Kayla,
from Tyler's posts.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.716
Which explains
the switch in M.O.

25:35.783 --> 25:38.018
Tyler was fixated
on strangulation.

25:38.086 --> 25:40.721
So, where's the unsub gonna
get his material for his next kill?

25:40.788 --> 25:42.556
All the victims used
different platforms.

25:42.623 --> 25:45.226
Writing seems to be
the only common denominator.

25:45.293 --> 25:47.627
Guys, what if he created
his own writing group?

25:47.695 --> 25:49.996
Dr. Houston's spoken
all over the country.

25:50.064 --> 25:52.198
He could have attended a conference
or read about his form of therapy.

25:52.266 --> 25:54.234
And adapted it
to fit his needs.

25:54.301 --> 25:55.422
Instead of
working the steps,

25:55.469 --> 25:57.436
he's focused
on one thing--

25:57.504 --> 26:00.874
acting out
homicidal stories.

26:00.941 --> 26:05.111
And a vivid description
of the blood,

26:05.179 --> 26:07.479
how it felt.

26:07.546 --> 26:11.516
I can tell you dug deep
for this one.

26:13.219 --> 26:14.819
Thank you, Tina.

26:17.190 --> 26:19.858
I believe we have time
for one more story.

26:19.926 --> 26:22.793
I've got one.

26:26.531 --> 26:28.165
Ah.

26:28.233 --> 26:30.834
The title of this one
is "Betrayed."

26:35.540 --> 26:38.808
"I never knew
someone I trusted

26:38.876 --> 26:41.011
"would hurt me
so deeply.

26:41.078 --> 26:45.315
"Tonight I'm going
to make him pay

26:45.383 --> 26:48.251
for stealing
what I valued most."

26:54.090 --> 26:55.857
Keep reading.

26:57.127 --> 26:59.561
You haven't gotten
to the best part.

27:08.187 --> 27:09.345
What I don't understand

27:09.370 --> 27:11.241
is why this guy's
removing all the tongues.

27:11.364 --> 27:13.598
Well, the tongues symbolize
the telling of tales.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.201
In his mind
they're trophies.

27:15.268 --> 27:17.268
And by taking them,
he was able to claim possession

27:17.270 --> 27:18.570
of stories
that weren't his own.

27:18.638 --> 27:20.039
It's likely the others
in the group

27:20.106 --> 27:21.974
aren't aware
of what he's doing.

27:22.042 --> 27:23.708
But with the specificity
of these crimes,

27:23.775 --> 27:24.896
it's only a matter of time

27:24.921 --> 27:26.674
before people put
the pieces together.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.481
Thank you very much.

27:30.549 --> 27:32.783
Good night, guys.
See you next week.

27:46.731 --> 27:48.765
So what'd you think?

27:52.036 --> 27:53.536
We're getting a lot
of calls,

27:53.604 --> 27:55.504
but so far none of the leads
are panning out.

27:58.242 --> 28:00.276
Go ahead, baby girl.
Talk to me.

28:00.344 --> 28:02.945
I got a hit on ViCAP.
3, one-offs, actually.

28:03.013 --> 28:04.446
Tampa, Atlanta, Charlotte.

28:04.514 --> 28:06.615
3 women in the last two years
who've all had their--

28:06.683 --> 28:08.584
it never gets less disgusting
to say--tongues removed.

28:08.651 --> 28:11.019
So this isn't the first time
he's done this.

28:11.087 --> 28:12.754
This is not his first
creepy rodeo.

28:12.821 --> 28:14.583
Nope, according to my digging,

28:14.608 --> 28:16.324
one of the first talks
that Dr. Houston gave

28:16.325 --> 28:18.093
was at an anonymous
call center in Tampa

28:18.160 --> 28:19.761
where a gentleman named
Mark Jackson was working,

28:19.828 --> 28:22.597
who mysteriously went AWOL
a few days later.

28:22.664 --> 28:24.399
Shortly thereafter, tongueless
bodies start showing up.

28:24.466 --> 28:25.767
Guess where he lives now.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.734
St. Paul.
Got a local address?

28:27.802 --> 28:29.169
Uh-huh, of course I do.
I have home

28:29.237 --> 28:32.172
and a place where he teaches
a writing group every Wednesday.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.073
Thank you, mama.

28:34.141 --> 28:36.709
Why did you stop?
Come on, I want feedback.

28:36.777 --> 28:39.779
I'll have notes
next week, Peter.

28:39.846 --> 28:42.815
Oh, come on, Mark.
Now is not the time to be shy.

28:42.883 --> 28:44.083
I'd rather not.

28:44.151 --> 28:46.152
What is it you'd like to say?
Speak and be heard.

28:46.220 --> 28:48.687
So please continue.

28:48.755 --> 28:50.055
Is something wrong?

28:50.123 --> 28:53.858
You plagiarized my work.
That's what's wrong.

28:55.261 --> 28:58.463
For 3 months
I confided in you.

28:58.531 --> 29:00.299
I told you everything.

29:00.366 --> 29:01.599
Listen to me.

29:01.667 --> 29:03.001
You told me that if wrote
about my fantasies,

29:03.069 --> 29:04.344
they would go away.

29:04.369 --> 29:05.837
Instead you just
took them from me.

29:05.838 --> 29:08.306
I said that it would
help suppress--

29:08.373 --> 29:10.274
No. No.
All you really wanted

29:10.342 --> 29:13.411
was to take what was in my head
for yourself.

29:13.478 --> 29:15.346
Excuse me?

29:16.614 --> 29:20.584
Let's get one thing straight.

29:20.652 --> 29:25.521
You are weak.

29:25.589 --> 29:29.025
What I did,

29:29.093 --> 29:31.361
you could never do yourself.

29:34.731 --> 29:37.133
Was she
going to be next?

29:37.201 --> 29:38.800
Who?

29:38.868 --> 29:39.935
Tammy.

29:40.003 --> 29:42.037
Was she next?

29:43.440 --> 29:44.873
Answer me.

29:48.644 --> 29:50.846
I can't let you have her.

29:50.913 --> 29:52.581
That one's special.

29:52.648 --> 29:56.084
She was gonna meet
with me, you know.

29:56.151 --> 29:57.585
Peter...

29:57.652 --> 29:59.620
She makes me feel normal.

29:59.688 --> 30:02.156
We have a real connection.

30:04.593 --> 30:06.660
And now you want
to take her away from me?

30:06.728 --> 30:09.330
You should be honored

30:09.398 --> 30:11.598
that I chose your stories.

30:11.665 --> 30:16.536
I did everything
that you described,

30:16.604 --> 30:18.872
down to the smallest
detail.

30:18.939 --> 30:21.475
Oh, I see.

30:21.542 --> 30:23.543
And that's where
you're wrong.

30:23.611 --> 30:26.278
What are you talking about?

30:26.346 --> 30:28.347
There's one detail

30:28.415 --> 30:31.783
you got wrong.

30:33.253 --> 30:37.189
I never cared
about the tongue.

30:40.593 --> 30:43.228
That was you.

30:50.969 --> 30:52.070
Clear!

30:52.138 --> 30:52.970
Clear!

30:53.039 --> 30:55.440
He's not here.

31:10.288 --> 31:12.889
It's Mark Jackson.
It's definitely our guy,

31:12.957 --> 31:15.091
but somebody got to him
before we could.

31:15.159 --> 31:16.992
Hotch, we never profiled
a second unsub.

31:17.061 --> 31:18.727
Well, we didn't have one
until now.

31:18.795 --> 31:20.863
Well, we got guys canvassing
the area for witnesses,

31:20.931 --> 31:23.666
but whoever did this
to Mark didn't hold back.

31:23.733 --> 31:25.101
Thanks.

31:25.169 --> 31:26.602
That had to be personal.

31:26.670 --> 31:29.105
No one walks around
carrying that type of rage.

31:29.173 --> 31:30.705
This kill doesn't show
the same level of confidence

31:30.773 --> 31:33.175
that Mark showed with
his previous victims.

31:33.242 --> 31:34.776
Mark could be
his first kill.

31:34.843 --> 31:37.345
It most likely
won't be his last.

31:52.660 --> 31:55.028
Thanks, Garcia.

31:55.097 --> 31:58.299
Well, she figured out
what made Mark tick.

31:58.366 --> 32:00.134
When he was 10,
he confessed to his mother

32:00.202 --> 32:02.202
that her boyfriend
had been abusing him.

32:02.269 --> 32:04.126
Mm-hmm. Let me guess.

32:04.151 --> 32:05.538
When Child Protective
Services arrived,

32:05.539 --> 32:06.706
she changed her story.

32:06.773 --> 32:08.808
Told them Mark had
made the whole thing up.

32:08.875 --> 32:10.876
It explains the tongues.
He viewed all women as liars.

32:10.944 --> 32:14.147
It looks like he documented
every attack.

32:14.215 --> 32:16.583
Mm-hmm. The semantics
in these two writings

32:16.650 --> 32:18.984
are markedly different.

32:19.051 --> 32:22.421
They were all composed
by different authors.

32:22.489 --> 32:25.491
Call first. To whom
am I speaking with this evening?

32:25.558 --> 32:26.992
My name is Peter.

32:27.059 --> 32:28.594
Hi, Peter.
How can I help you?

32:28.661 --> 32:30.295
Uh, I'm not sure
where to start.

32:30.363 --> 32:32.231
Start wherever
is most comfortable.

32:32.298 --> 32:33.999
I feel I'm at a crossroads.

32:34.066 --> 32:38.603
The point in my life where...

32:38.670 --> 32:41.105
I'm faced with
some tough decisions.

32:41.173 --> 32:44.108
The kind that once you commit,

32:44.176 --> 32:45.809
you can never go back.

32:45.877 --> 32:49.180
Making a choice
can be stressful for anyone.

32:49.248 --> 32:51.214
I just...

32:51.282 --> 32:53.283
need something to point me
in the right direction.

32:53.351 --> 32:54.551
I understand.

32:54.619 --> 32:57.387
We all experience moments
where we need clarity in life.

32:57.455 --> 32:59.507
It's important you understand

32:59.532 --> 33:01.532
it's something that everyone
goes through.

33:02.226 --> 33:05.928
Hello? Hello. Peter?

33:16.706 --> 33:19.026
Let me get this straight.
Mark encouraged his group members

33:19.042 --> 33:20.376
to go after these women?

33:20.443 --> 33:22.477
Not exactly.
He wanted them to document

33:22.545 --> 33:24.712
their violent thoughts
and emotions

33:24.780 --> 33:25.946
down to the last detail.

33:26.014 --> 33:27.815
And he used those
as blueprints for his kills.

33:27.883 --> 33:29.950
We think our new unsub
was in the group.

33:30.018 --> 33:32.253
When he discovered what Mark
had done, he unraveled.

33:32.321 --> 33:34.122
And now that he's given
in to his urges,

33:34.147 --> 33:34.989
he may want to kill again.

33:34.990 --> 33:38.325
"Pat in the Park." "Nicole's
Knight." "Laurel's Open Window."

33:38.393 --> 33:39.626
Sound familiar?

33:39.694 --> 33:41.728
Those were
the first 3 victims.

33:41.796 --> 33:43.830
They were all written
by someone named Peter.

33:43.898 --> 33:46.500
His most recent story is about
saving a woman named Tammy

33:46.568 --> 33:47.634
from drowning in a lake.

33:47.702 --> 33:49.869
It's 30 degrees outside.
They'd freeze to death.

33:49.937 --> 33:51.171
Sir, yes, sir.

33:51.239 --> 33:52.839
Garcia, what's the name
of the organization

33:52.907 --> 33:54.540
- where Mark volunteered?
- Call first.

33:54.608 --> 33:56.676
All right. Check their phone records
for the days Mark worked,

33:56.743 --> 33:59.044
for any calls that came in from
someone named Peter.

33:59.112 --> 34:01.113
Ok, this is a crazy
popular hotline.

34:01.181 --> 34:03.416
They get a ton of calls,
like a half a dozen Peters.

34:03.483 --> 34:05.618
Any of them call
multiple times?

34:05.686 --> 34:08.020
Let me see--mm, mm, mm--

34:08.088 --> 34:10.809
here's one--Peter Harper.
It looks like Mark initially took the call.

34:10.856 --> 34:13.123
And the last time Peter
called the hotline was...

34:13.192 --> 34:15.126
less than an hour ago.

34:15.194 --> 34:17.061
Where would Peter Harper
be now?

34:17.129 --> 34:18.963
Rosewood, just outside
of St. Paul.

34:19.031 --> 34:20.297
Yeah, that's gotta
be him.

34:20.366 --> 34:22.033
But where is he taking Tammy?

34:22.101 --> 34:23.167
It looks like
she's a swimmer.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.670
Water is crucial
to Peter's fantasy.

34:25.737 --> 34:27.670
Hey, there's a community
center nearby.

34:27.739 --> 34:29.840
I'm sending you the digits
right now.

34:29.907 --> 34:31.074
Thanks, Garcia.

34:45.522 --> 34:46.989
Aah!

34:57.636 --> 35:00.005
Somebody help!

35:00.073 --> 35:01.551
Please?

35:01.552 --> 35:03.786
Hello? Is someone there?

35:07.025 --> 35:09.091
Who are you?

35:09.609 --> 35:10.876
What am I doing here?

35:10.944 --> 35:14.145
God, you're even more
beautiful up close.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.949
Don't touch me.

35:17.016 --> 35:19.485
Who are you?

35:19.552 --> 35:21.820
It's me, Peter.

35:21.888 --> 35:23.622
Oh, my God.

35:23.690 --> 35:25.422
Shh...

35:25.491 --> 35:27.959
Why are you doing this?

35:28.026 --> 35:29.894
I need your help
with something

35:29.962 --> 35:33.330
I've been struggling
with for a while now.

35:33.398 --> 35:35.199
What is it?

35:36.267 --> 35:38.268
I need you to convince me

35:38.336 --> 35:40.237
not to kill you.

35:54.719 --> 35:56.486
Please tell me
why you're doing this.

35:56.553 --> 35:58.954
I had to protect you
from him.

35:59.022 --> 36:00.956
What? Who?

36:01.024 --> 36:05.160
It doesn't matter anymore.
He's gone now.

36:06.596 --> 36:08.964
Don't cry.

36:09.032 --> 36:13.535
Do you know how long
I've waited for this moment?

36:23.045 --> 36:25.246
I wrote something for you.

36:30.217 --> 36:33.520
"If she only knew
how special she was,

36:33.588 --> 36:38.158
"how she made me
feel human for the first time.

36:38.225 --> 36:40.460
"But...

36:40.528 --> 36:46.165
"If she knew about the secret
thoughts I had,

36:46.232 --> 36:49.602
would she stay?"

36:49.670 --> 36:51.804
What do you think?

36:53.373 --> 36:56.275
You need help.

36:56.342 --> 37:00.779
Peter, I can be there
for you.

37:01.914 --> 37:04.883
I know the moment
I untie you, you'll leave.

37:04.951 --> 37:09.054
I already lost someone today.
I can't lose you, too.

37:09.121 --> 37:10.922
You have my word.

37:10.990 --> 37:14.292
God, I wish I believed you.

37:16.495 --> 37:18.662
No, no, no.

37:29.440 --> 37:32.842
I couldn't have
written this any better.

37:45.856 --> 37:48.124
Peter Harper, FBI!
Don't move!

37:48.191 --> 37:49.725
Drop the knife, Peter!

37:49.792 --> 37:51.059
I can't.

37:51.127 --> 37:52.127
I'm going in.

37:52.194 --> 37:54.429
Mark was a liar
and a thief

37:54.497 --> 37:56.431
and I made him pay.

38:05.907 --> 38:08.175
Peter, I know
he betrayed your trust.

38:08.243 --> 38:10.911
Just put the knife down
and we can talk about this.

38:10.979 --> 38:12.546
You don't know
what it's like--

38:12.614 --> 38:17.685
the thoughts and the images
that won't go away.

38:20.188 --> 38:21.655
This is my only option.

38:21.722 --> 38:23.289
Peter, that's not true.

38:23.357 --> 38:24.791
Listen, I know exactly

38:24.859 --> 38:27.060
what it's like.

38:28.462 --> 38:30.429
Right now is the part where
I'm supposed to lie to you,

38:30.497 --> 38:32.866
tell you that everything's
gonna be ok

38:32.933 --> 38:34.333
and that we can somehow
help you,

38:34.401 --> 38:39.004
but the fact of the matter
is, Peter, I don't know if we can.

38:39.072 --> 38:41.774
There might not be
any form of therapy

38:41.841 --> 38:44.376
that ever
takes these urges away.

38:44.443 --> 38:45.944
Spence, what are you doing?

38:46.012 --> 38:48.714
But that doesn't mean
you stop trying.

38:48.782 --> 38:51.884
Peter, no matter what happens,
you have to keep trying.

38:51.951 --> 38:54.886
I know it's not
what you want to hear,

38:54.953 --> 38:57.488
but at least it's the truth.

39:06.131 --> 39:09.700
I appreciate your honesty.

39:29.986 --> 39:31.420
Oscar Wilde said,

39:31.487 --> 39:35.557
"I can resist anything
except temptation."

39:35.625 --> 39:37.793
Reid.

39:37.894 --> 39:39.762
I just finished
the case file.

39:39.830 --> 39:41.111
I talked to Morgan and JJ

39:41.136 --> 39:42.897
and I wanted to talk to you
about what happened.

39:42.898 --> 39:44.498
The hostage was clear
and I made a tactical decision

39:44.533 --> 39:46.901
to tell the unsub the truth
about his condition.

39:46.969 --> 39:48.402
And what did you think
that would accomplish?

39:48.470 --> 39:51.439
Well, Hotch, I thought the last
time I was in a situation like this,

39:51.506 --> 39:53.108
I did exactly what
I was supposed to.

39:53.175 --> 39:54.508
I told a perfect lie
and that didn't work,

39:54.576 --> 39:56.477
so this time, in the hopes of
saving someone's life,

39:56.545 --> 39:57.577
I tried something different.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.146
And this didn't work.

39:59.214 --> 40:02.282
Sadly, no.

40:02.316 --> 40:05.219
To me, this is very
clearly about Maive.

40:13.293 --> 40:16.963
I just wanted to apologize
for the way I acted earlier.

40:17.030 --> 40:19.165
No. No, no, no.
Please, please don't apologize.

40:19.233 --> 40:22.135
That was all me.
I was being really snappy.

40:22.202 --> 40:23.702
I just...

40:23.804 --> 40:26.773
Well, I never knew
you were taking ukulele lessons.

40:26.840 --> 40:28.807
Yeah. It's number 32
on my

40:28.875 --> 40:31.743
I don't want to
call it a bucket list, bucket list.

40:31.811 --> 40:34.345
You know, I never thought
we'd be here.

40:34.380 --> 40:36.714
Well, when you break up
with someone, there's that fantasy

40:36.816 --> 40:40.551
that you can stay friends,
which I guess is a fantasy.

40:40.619 --> 40:42.854
Penelope,
I want to be friends.

40:42.922 --> 40:44.789
So do I. But can you
handle it?

40:44.856 --> 40:47.624
Because friends support each other
and their relationships,

40:47.692 --> 40:50.861
and so far I have seen you
now date Gina, Lisa,

40:50.929 --> 40:53.630
Mindy, Leslie, Shannon,
Gina again.

40:53.698 --> 40:54.965
I get it.

40:55.033 --> 40:57.835
I mean--
it's not easy for me,

40:57.903 --> 40:59.369
but I want you
to be happy.

40:59.437 --> 41:01.070
Same here.

41:01.138 --> 41:02.806
Ok. Ok, I gotta go.

41:02.873 --> 41:04.307
Hey.

41:04.374 --> 41:07.210
By the way,
Gina really liked the bracelet

41:07.278 --> 41:08.711
you helped me pick out.

41:08.779 --> 41:11.014
Well, I do know jewelry.

41:11.081 --> 41:12.682
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:12.749 --> 41:14.517
Bright and early.

41:14.584 --> 41:17.786
I don't know how much longer
I can contain the crowd.

41:32.935 --> 41:34.268
Thank you.

41:34.336 --> 41:37.004
Penelope, Penelope...

41:37.072 --> 41:38.005
Ok.

41:38.073 --> 41:39.173
Ahem.

41:39.241 --> 41:40.674
Tonight's premiere
