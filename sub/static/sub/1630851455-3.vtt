00:05.127 --> 00:06.996
(Episode 3)

00:06.996 --> 00:09.866
(What Is "Untitled" About?)

00:11.366 --> 00:12.797
Give it to me!

00:19.737 --> 00:22.947
Before I burn these paintings here,

00:22.947 --> 00:24.616
you'd better pay me back!

00:24.616 --> 00:26.177
Give me my money!

00:26.177 --> 00:28.517
- Give him his money!
- Give him his money!

00:47.466 --> 00:49.636
(Episode 3)

00:50.437 --> 00:52.577
Did you hire the ones with the look?

00:53.237 --> 00:55.047
I mostly hired the big ones.

01:01.447 --> 01:02.517
Violent...

01:02.517 --> 01:04.245
Just smash it.

01:04.245 --> 01:06.057
Then we stab him!

01:06.187 --> 01:07.286
Merciless...

01:07.286 --> 01:10.086
- I'm on the phone.
- Move over!

01:10.527 --> 01:12.627
And nasty. Those were the criteria.

01:25.036 --> 01:26.137
What are they doing?

01:30.706 --> 01:33.116
- Give us back the money!
- Money!

01:45.556 --> 01:46.797
Mr. Jin?

01:57.206 --> 01:58.277
No, I'm not.

01:59.737 --> 02:01.476
It's you, isn't it?

02:05.116 --> 02:07.446
- Go over there.
- Wait. Hold on.

02:13.257 --> 02:14.887
You're Mr. Jin Moo Hak, right?

02:54.357 --> 02:55.667
Do you guys know each other?

02:57.267 --> 02:58.267
What?

02:58.496 --> 03:00.297
Do you two...

03:01.406 --> 03:02.866
know each other?

03:04.007 --> 03:05.007
What?

03:08.776 --> 03:09.906
I'm sorry for the ruckus.

03:10.047 --> 03:12.116
This is my first day here,
so I'm a bit clumsy.

03:39.676 --> 03:43.047
I can't believe I ran into you here.

03:43.146 --> 03:44.547
What a strange fate we have.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.447
Don't exaggerate.

03:47.776 --> 03:49.847
I almost couldn't recognize you.

03:50.547 --> 03:52.387
You look very different.

03:55.387 --> 03:58.597
Right. You said you had
an important contract.

03:58.597 --> 03:59.956
Did it go well?

04:01.626 --> 04:03.767
I know it was a misunderstanding,

04:03.866 --> 04:05.966
but I hope
it didn't mess up your work.

04:05.966 --> 04:08.436
Gosh, I can't take this anymore.

04:09.266 --> 04:10.606
Why do you act like we're close?

04:11.336 --> 04:12.537
Do we have something special?

04:13.258 --> 04:14.999
Do we have
a relationship or something?

04:20.676 --> 04:23.446
No, we don't.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.087
Let me make this clear.

04:25.417 --> 04:26.657
You and me.

04:27.056 --> 04:29.287
I'm your creditor. You, my debtor.
That's all there is to it.

04:29.487 --> 04:30.487
Got that?

04:36.696 --> 04:39.066
This coffee tastes awful.
What's wrong with this?

04:39.196 --> 04:40.967
It's actually pu'er tea,

04:41.196 --> 04:42.667
but I couldn't find the teacups.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.837
This doesn't taste like pear tea.

04:44.837 --> 04:45.876
It must've gone bad.

04:48.777 --> 04:51.107
It's pu'er tea, not pear tea.

04:53.746 --> 04:55.446
That's enough.

04:56.446 --> 04:58.256
I didn't come here to have some tea.

04:59.357 --> 05:01.417
Did you see what I did back there?
Did you?

05:01.787 --> 05:04.256
I can be merciless and brutal
when it comes to money.

05:04.897 --> 05:06.657
Law? Saving face?

05:07.097 --> 05:08.397
That's none of my business.

05:08.967 --> 05:11.066
So don't try
to squirm out of this...

05:11.066 --> 05:13.397
by pretending like we're close.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.537
Just pay up
while I'm still being nice.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.876
You see, you weren't
on the list of debts...

05:18.876 --> 05:20.136
that was written by our lawyer.

05:20.136 --> 05:21.306
I said...

05:24.977 --> 05:27.016
that's none of my business.

05:27.847 --> 05:29.616
I lent you guys money,

05:29.616 --> 05:31.886
and I'm intending to get
every single penny back.

05:32.357 --> 05:34.756
So sell your house, paintings,

05:34.756 --> 05:37.926
or any of your organs
that are of value...

05:38.496 --> 05:40.326
to pay me what you owe.

05:45.337 --> 05:46.366
Right.

05:47.467 --> 05:49.636
Let me warn you beforehand.

05:50.366 --> 05:52.506
Don't you dare think
about trying to pay me back...

05:52.506 --> 05:54.576
with your paintings.

05:55.407 --> 05:57.977
I want it in cash. Got it?

05:59.847 --> 06:02.446
If you don't listen to me,

06:03.087 --> 06:05.116
I'll set this place on fire.

06:13.326 --> 06:14.357
Let's start.

06:14.357 --> 06:17.696
- And go all the way down.
- Okay.

06:17.866 --> 06:18.936
All the way.

06:18.936 --> 06:20.636
- Gosh.
- That sounds about right.

06:21.136 --> 06:22.266
Oh, hello.

06:22.266 --> 06:24.436
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, ma'am.

06:26.376 --> 06:27.506
He looks vicious.

06:46.297 --> 06:47.996
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:48.766 --> 06:49.826
Mr. Jin.

06:50.667 --> 06:52.167
You should purchase your tickets.

06:53.936 --> 06:56.907
Since there are more than 15 people,
you'll get a discount.

06:57.066 --> 06:59.777
I'll leave you to it. Goodbye, then.

07:01.436 --> 07:03.306
- Wait.
- This way, please.

07:09.047 --> 07:11.787
The gallery was fine.

07:11.787 --> 07:13.756
Don't be ridiculous.

07:13.987 --> 07:16.157
I couldn't understand
a single thing.

07:16.157 --> 07:17.626
You're so ignorant.

07:17.626 --> 07:21.397
You're not supposed
to understand art. Got that?

07:21.397 --> 07:23.527
- Oh, is that so?
- Yes.

07:23.626 --> 07:27.936
Members of the Cheongsong family
sure are different.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.506
She looked so elegant.

07:30.506 --> 07:33.176
She wasn't intimidated
by these men...

07:33.176 --> 07:34.936
and stood her ground.

07:35.477 --> 07:37.407
Is this what they call "dignity"?

07:38.816 --> 07:40.347
Dig... What?

07:41.647 --> 07:43.487
I told you not to speak English
in front of me.

07:43.816 --> 07:45.917
It's similar to elegance.

07:45.917 --> 07:48.256
No, it's more than that.

07:48.256 --> 07:49.487
In any case,

07:50.157 --> 07:53.426
she has something that you lack.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.597
You little...

07:54.597 --> 07:57.097
By the way, how do you know
the only child and daughter...

07:57.097 --> 07:58.297
of the Cheongsong family?

08:01.936 --> 08:03.266
We're not that close.

08:03.266 --> 08:06.076
I just ran into her
a couple of times.

08:06.076 --> 08:08.037
I see. So you just ran into her...

08:08.037 --> 08:09.746
like you would with your neighbors?

08:13.246 --> 08:15.347
No, not really.

08:15.616 --> 08:16.787
But you know what?

08:17.016 --> 08:19.386
Perhaps, we'll be able to get
our two million dollars back easily.

08:20.487 --> 08:22.287
- How come?
- You know Segi Group, right?

08:22.287 --> 08:23.987
- Segi?
- There was once a talk about...

08:23.987 --> 08:25.996
a possible engagement
between her and the heir.

08:27.826 --> 08:29.266
They were so close
to getting married,

08:29.266 --> 08:30.667
but then her family backed out.

08:31.027 --> 08:32.797
We don't know why,

08:33.135 --> 08:35.066
but it's evident that
they didn't care about his money.

08:36.567 --> 08:38.837
Maybe he wasn't that great of a guy.

08:39.207 --> 08:42.447
Or perhaps, he lacked humor.

08:43.775 --> 08:47.077
Humor? Why would you say that
out of the blue?

08:49.416 --> 08:52.857
From the first time I saw you,
I always thought you were a psy...

08:54.656 --> 08:57.327
I mean, you seem like
an interesting man.

08:57.427 --> 08:58.957
Your shoes,

08:58.957 --> 09:01.396
the way you count everything
by bowls of gamjatang,

09:01.396 --> 09:02.896
and back at the party too.

09:03.496 --> 09:06.396
Anyway, you're the most
interesting person I've met.

09:14.406 --> 09:16.646
Hold on. I thought they were over.

09:16.646 --> 09:18.246
What does that have to do
with our money?

09:18.376 --> 09:22.146
The guy is still pining for her.

09:22.546 --> 09:26.587
He paid for everything
during her father's funeral.

09:26.587 --> 09:29.286
The love of his life is being
threatened by these idiots...

09:32.656 --> 09:34.656
She's being threatened by these men.

09:34.656 --> 09:37.967
He'll willingly pay for her safety.
After all, he's from Segi Group.

09:38.166 --> 09:39.636
This is our chance.

09:40.237 --> 09:42.967
So he's trying to win her over
with money? How petty.

09:43.567 --> 09:44.607
What?

09:44.837 --> 09:47.607
That won't win her heart.

09:48.906 --> 09:51.546
How could a wealthy family's daughter
be so easily swayed?

09:51.546 --> 09:53.516
That says a lot
about such elite families.

09:53.516 --> 09:54.847
Well, good luck to them.

09:54.847 --> 09:57.616
Lucky for me, I'll be able to get...

09:57.616 --> 10:00.516
my two million back in no time.
That's just great!

10:00.886 --> 10:02.557
Why is it so hot in here?

10:03.087 --> 10:06.057
Drive properly, will you?
I'm getting carsick!

10:09.766 --> 10:11.266
What's the matter with this?

10:42.266 --> 10:43.827
Hey, you're back.
Will they give us our money back?

10:43.996 --> 10:45.896
I mean, it's the Cheongsong family.
I'm sure they still have some money.

10:47.896 --> 10:49.807
What are you doing in my office?

10:50.707 --> 10:51.766
What?

10:54.607 --> 10:55.607
Well...

10:56.347 --> 10:58.977
I heard you had gone to the gallery,
so I was curious.

11:00.717 --> 11:03.717
But you sound very prickly.

11:04.286 --> 11:06.487
Why would you ask me
such a question?

11:06.987 --> 11:09.656
Can't I visit my brother's office
whenever I please?

11:14.156 --> 11:15.796
So tell me what happened.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.626
Do they have the money?

11:19.296 --> 11:21.097
Does that even matter?

11:21.636 --> 11:24.567
Don't worry.
I'll get it at all costs.

11:27.607 --> 11:30.376
Right. You're not the type
who'd be easily scammed.

11:35.546 --> 11:38.916
By the way,
let's make one thing clear.

11:39.756 --> 11:42.626
The only thing I did was
to introduce you to Cheongsong.

11:42.756 --> 11:45.396
But you made the final decision
of lending them...

11:46.156 --> 11:47.796
the money. Right?

11:51.496 --> 11:52.567
What did you say?

11:54.036 --> 11:55.807
Well, that's the fact.

11:56.107 --> 11:57.967
I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

11:59.307 --> 12:00.837
All right.
I'll let you get back to work.

12:01.107 --> 12:03.347
- Ki Chul.
- Yes?

12:06.447 --> 12:09.347
You know, the director
of Cheongsong Gallery.

12:09.347 --> 12:10.587
The man who passed away.

12:11.746 --> 12:13.016
What about him?

12:13.217 --> 12:14.817
How did he die?

12:15.156 --> 12:16.957
Had he been sick for a while?

12:18.526 --> 12:20.057
How would I know that?

12:21.026 --> 12:24.296
Well, you were the one
who made the introduction.

12:24.467 --> 12:26.197
And you also met with him
the day before he passed away.

12:26.197 --> 12:28.536
Why would I meet with him?

12:29.406 --> 12:31.837
Wasn't that the day when I left
for the Netherlands?

12:32.276 --> 12:34.077
You were going to visit him
on my behalf.

12:35.577 --> 12:36.707
Gosh.

12:37.807 --> 12:39.177
Oh, that.

12:39.276 --> 12:41.016
I couldn't go see him
because Dad threw a huge fit...

12:41.016 --> 12:43.317
when he found out about the loan.

12:43.947 --> 12:45.756
How could I have visited him
when he was going berserk?

12:45.756 --> 12:47.156
I needed to stay low.

12:48.516 --> 12:49.626
Right.

12:55.057 --> 12:56.266
I'll see you later.

13:10.577 --> 13:13.116
I need you to give back
the investment money.

13:13.847 --> 13:14.876
Pardon?

13:16.847 --> 13:19.016
How dare you come here?

13:35.666 --> 13:37.967
Darn it.

13:48.447 --> 13:49.646
Hello, Dad.

13:50.217 --> 13:53.116
Yes. No. I'm on my way.

13:53.616 --> 13:56.457
Yes. Okay.

14:00.156 --> 14:02.796
(Sale of Tangible Assets)

14:06.937 --> 14:08.067
(Director Kim Da Li)

14:16.447 --> 14:18.006
He usually kept...

14:18.307 --> 14:21.016
important documents in here.

14:26.386 --> 14:27.516
(Estimate Sheet)

14:29.756 --> 14:32.597
(Dondon F and B)

14:34.927 --> 14:36.097
(Dondon F and B)

14:36.467 --> 14:38.967
(Loan Agreement,
Amount: Two million dollars)

14:41.666 --> 14:42.906
(Debtor Kim Nak Chun)

14:42.906 --> 14:46.077
The loan was probably
for the Basquiat exhibit.

14:46.707 --> 14:49.607
It was a very popular exhibit.
So the competition is pretty high.

14:49.947 --> 14:51.746
It must have cost a fortune
to prepare the exhibit.

14:52.817 --> 14:54.046
The Basquiat exhibit?

14:56.016 --> 14:58.487
He said there should be
sophisticated exhibits...

14:58.487 --> 15:00.756
to encourage people
to frequent galleries in Korea.

15:01.457 --> 15:04.487
The director put a lot of effort
into this exhibit.

15:06.097 --> 15:07.526
When's the exhibit scheduled?

15:08.866 --> 15:11.296
The first week of next October.

15:15.296 --> 15:17.636
You must have been shocked earlier.

15:21.707 --> 15:24.447
I've never seen
such uncultured people in my life.

15:24.646 --> 15:26.577
The ink on his death certificate
hasn't even dried yet.

15:26.646 --> 15:29.817
And besides, they made that scene
in front of our sacred artworks.

15:30.386 --> 15:32.457
I've only heard
of those thugs and gangsters.

15:32.457 --> 15:34.616
But I've never witnessed
a scene like that...

15:34.616 --> 15:37.156
in my 20 years working as a curator.

15:38.727 --> 15:40.156
I'm sorry.

15:40.256 --> 15:41.327
Gosh.

15:41.896 --> 15:42.896
What?

15:43.526 --> 15:46.996
Gosh. Those thugs are
the ones who should be apologizing.

15:46.996 --> 15:48.467
Why are you sorry, Director Kim?

15:51.906 --> 15:54.636
Now, you are the director
of this gallery.

15:56.677 --> 16:00.146
To be honest, I thought
you would close down the gallery.

16:01.717 --> 16:02.817
It only looks good from the outside.

16:02.817 --> 16:04.687
People might think
this is a fancy place.

16:04.947 --> 16:07.457
But you must know the reality
after watching your father over the years.

16:07.687 --> 16:09.957
The reality
of art galleries in Korea.

16:11.987 --> 16:14.457
Thank you
for taking responsibility...

16:15.666 --> 16:16.866
instead of giving up.

16:17.996 --> 16:20.097
I will need a lot of help from you.

16:20.796 --> 16:22.536
Of course.

16:23.166 --> 16:25.366
Let me see.

16:25.876 --> 16:27.437
What should we do first?

16:28.737 --> 16:32.077
All right. This is the list
of artworks our gallery owns.

16:32.077 --> 16:34.177
And these are the lists...

16:34.177 --> 16:37.286
of artists and their artworks
who are working with our gallery.

16:37.286 --> 16:38.786
I have a lot of files here.

16:38.786 --> 16:42.256
And this is the schedule
for this year's exhibits.

16:42.256 --> 16:45.996
These are the progress reports
on our next year's exhibits.

16:48.756 --> 16:50.166
You have a lot
to catch up on, right?

16:50.166 --> 16:52.536
But luckily, I'm a quick study.

16:52.996 --> 16:54.396
I have no doubt about it.

16:54.536 --> 16:58.636
And these are the art catalogs
for our past exhibits.

16:58.707 --> 16:59.807
All right.

17:01.077 --> 17:02.136
Oh, right.

17:03.347 --> 17:07.376
We got a lot of phone calls
from Segi Group asking for you.

17:09.316 --> 17:11.586
I handled them on my end.

17:11.786 --> 17:14.656
But I thought
you should at least know.

17:16.556 --> 17:19.627
He also helped us a lot
with the funeral behind the scenes.

17:20.396 --> 17:23.627
I think it's polite to thank him
at least once.

17:35.677 --> 17:37.147
Excuse me.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.256
You can send out the entire list.
From the top.

17:47.256 --> 17:50.457
- Si Hyung.
- Okay. Hey.

17:51.586 --> 17:52.657
Si Hyung.

17:53.826 --> 17:55.627
Si Hyung. Wait.

17:59.766 --> 18:00.996
Gosh. Si Hyung.

18:01.296 --> 18:02.437
Si Hyung!

18:10.276 --> 18:12.147
Hey. Did you send it out?

18:13.276 --> 18:15.147
Then send it to the buyers.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.417
Trust? Trust, my foot.

18:18.617 --> 18:20.887
Hey, nothing beats money.

18:21.856 --> 18:23.056
The gallery is about to go under.

18:23.056 --> 18:25.657
No one would wait
until the payment date.

18:25.927 --> 18:29.367
Come on! I have a plan.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.836
Just do what I say.

18:32.836 --> 18:34.467
Focus on your job!

18:35.237 --> 18:36.306
Bye.

(Jeil Newspaper)

18:51.496 --> 18:53.297
(Cheongsong Gallery in Crisis)

18:59.453 --> 19:01.883
- Did you see this?
- My goodness.

19:01.883 --> 19:03.294
Isn't this Cheongsong Gallery?

19:03.294 --> 19:05.024
- What's this?
- What?

19:05.024 --> 19:07.594
- Look at this.
- Goodness.

19:07.663 --> 19:10.564
(The people on the floor
put the paintings to shame.)

19:10.994 --> 19:13.403
(Zoo next to a gallery, Safari)

19:13.403 --> 19:16.133
(A zoo in a gallery?
Seized by tigers, dragons, carps...)

19:16.133 --> 19:19.104
(Let's lead honest lives,
Cheongsong Gallery)

19:19.403 --> 19:21.074
I'm hungry. So hurry up.

19:21.074 --> 19:22.713
I need to get back by 1 p.m.

19:24.274 --> 19:26.344
If you don't come out,
I'll ask you out.

19:27.143 --> 19:29.554
- Come sit. What took you so long?
- Hello.

19:29.554 --> 19:31.953
- I think ten points.
- Ten points?

19:36.254 --> 19:39.024
Our blind date didn't pan out.
Why do you keep coming here?

19:39.494 --> 19:41.524
Don't you have tteokbokki restaurants
near your office?

19:41.794 --> 19:43.564
I don't work at an office.
I work at a gallery.

19:43.564 --> 19:45.663
And no one likes me at work.
So I have no one to eat with.

19:46.633 --> 19:49.504
So who's the lunatic that came
to the gallery and threw a fit?

19:50.034 --> 19:51.473
How did you know?

19:51.473 --> 19:53.143
We had the worst client today
at our gallery.

19:53.143 --> 19:56.014
You told me that you pigged out
when you're stressed.

19:56.014 --> 19:58.514
So you had five servings
of gamjatang on our blind date.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.114
You finished
the whole thing by yourself.

20:00.183 --> 20:02.554
Gosh, you remember everything?

20:03.814 --> 20:05.514
I told you to stop obsessing
over me.

20:05.514 --> 20:07.483
Even if you're my type,

20:07.483 --> 20:10.854
there's a line I cannot cross.

20:12.054 --> 20:14.223
Don't cross that line. Okay?

20:14.594 --> 20:16.133
You'd better not cross it.

20:16.133 --> 20:17.893
Gosh. You're so cute.

20:17.893 --> 20:19.534
You and I cannot happen
even if you're cute.

20:21.504 --> 20:23.233
So who was your awful client?

20:24.804 --> 20:27.903
You said it would double!
And it might even quadruple!

20:28.703 --> 20:31.014
Which one of you lied to me?

20:33.614 --> 20:35.344
- Is it you?
- No.

20:37.054 --> 20:38.054
You?

20:38.653 --> 20:40.754
- No.
- Then is it...

20:41.854 --> 20:42.893
you?

20:43.453 --> 20:44.524
No, ma'am.

20:45.324 --> 20:46.364
Then...

20:48.220 --> 20:49.720
What are you talking about?
It is you!

20:49.720 --> 20:51.820
How dare you lie to my face again?

20:51.820 --> 20:53.889
- You...
- It's not a lie, ma'am.

20:53.889 --> 20:55.359
Please calm down.

20:55.359 --> 20:57.230
You want me to calm down?

20:57.230 --> 20:59.800
Hey. What did you say to me that time?

20:59.800 --> 21:02.000
That the oldie who painted
that painting was about to die.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.800
That once he died, the painting
would be worth twice the money.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.770
That it would be "finders keepers"
and bring me four times the money!

21:07.369 --> 21:08.470
I did?

21:09.240 --> 21:11.810
Hey. That man got married again.

21:12.010 --> 21:13.909
With a girl in her 20s.

21:14.339 --> 21:16.780
And even had children at that age.
Twins, at that!

21:16.780 --> 21:19.619
I see. Children at that age. Twins.

21:19.619 --> 21:24.450
Ma'am, unlike investments or real estate,
with art,

21:24.450 --> 21:27.060
you have to look really far in advance.

21:27.060 --> 21:30.490
That man's painting was sold
at half the price at the auction!

21:31.589 --> 21:33.300
What are you going to do
about my money now?

21:33.300 --> 21:35.399
What are you going to do?

21:35.399 --> 21:37.129
I swear...

21:37.429 --> 21:38.470
You witch!

21:38.470 --> 21:40.040
- Ma'am.
- Hey!

21:40.040 --> 21:41.540
No!

21:41.540 --> 21:43.139
Let me go!

21:43.139 --> 21:45.470
- No!
- Let me go!

21:45.470 --> 21:49.550
Hey, you! Come back!

21:49.550 --> 21:51.849
People that stupid still exist?

21:52.310 --> 21:53.950
And you just watched that happen?

21:54.079 --> 21:57.290
Then what was I supposed to do?
She's a customer. A VIP, even.

21:58.689 --> 22:01.060
They act like that...

22:01.060 --> 22:03.359
precisely because you are too soft
around customers.

22:03.359 --> 22:05.760
An eye for an eye.
An ear for an ear.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.399
You have to be more assertive!

22:09.929 --> 22:12.500
Moo Hak...

22:12.800 --> 22:14.899
Ear? You must mean nose.

22:14.899 --> 22:16.839
An eye for an eye.
A nose for a nose.

22:16.939 --> 22:19.280
(An eye for an eye!
A tooth for a tooth!)

22:19.280 --> 22:20.710
Goodness.

22:22.780 --> 22:24.780
Who cares?
As long as you get the meaning across.

22:25.773 --> 22:29.149
This is the difference between us.

22:29.149 --> 22:30.689
You are too stupid.

22:38.859 --> 22:39.899
My gosh.

22:40.599 --> 22:43.369
That woman was a drop in the box.

22:43.369 --> 22:44.570
(A drop in the bucket)

22:44.570 --> 22:45.629
What is it?

22:46.099 --> 22:48.800
Look. Aren't they the rudest?

22:49.070 --> 22:52.240
Why are they doing this at a museum?

22:53.040 --> 22:55.139
This is true stupidity.

22:55.379 --> 22:58.250
So what if you're not good at
English or idioms?

22:58.409 --> 23:02.119
You at least don't act like this
in front of artworks.

23:03.389 --> 23:04.490
Well...

23:05.750 --> 23:07.389
I'm sure they had their reasons.

23:08.460 --> 23:09.889
Whatever.

23:12.490 --> 23:13.629
Wait.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.000
This silhouette looks familiar.

23:25.470 --> 23:26.810
Just eat.

23:27.939 --> 23:29.950
One more serving of sundae, please.

23:30.379 --> 23:31.980
Extra lung and liver.

23:34.653 --> 23:36.992
Anyway, Cheongsong is
nearing its end now.

23:38.349 --> 23:40.389
What do you mean "end"?

23:40.389 --> 23:43.490
Would anyone want to come to a museum
with gang members?

23:43.629 --> 23:45.889
Would artists want
to exhibit their artwork?

23:45.889 --> 23:48.829
A museum without guests
or artists is bound to close.

23:49.570 --> 23:52.899
I'm sure the rumors
have spread already.

23:59.040 --> 24:02.109
What are you worried about
when the payment deadline is so far away?

24:02.750 --> 24:06.579
How many years of trust
have we built to this point?

24:06.579 --> 24:08.550
Cheongsong will be fine.

24:09.220 --> 24:10.419
Really.

24:11.320 --> 24:13.359
Can you please hold for a second?

24:13.790 --> 24:15.619
You don't need to worry about that.

24:15.990 --> 24:17.629
We even have a new director.

24:18.260 --> 24:20.329
Excuse me? Oh, certainly.

24:20.329 --> 24:22.530
I will pay a visit with the new director
in the near future.

24:23.030 --> 24:24.530
Thank you. Take care.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.669
Yes. Hold on for a second.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.369
Hello?

24:29.869 --> 24:32.909
The exhibitions are on
without any issues.

24:33.780 --> 24:34.780
A loan?

24:35.780 --> 24:37.010
I'm not sure...

24:37.780 --> 24:38.849
Please hold.

24:41.450 --> 24:42.950
Hello. This is Ms. Song.

24:42.950 --> 24:45.119
It's just a small mishap.

24:45.320 --> 24:46.619
We'll deal with it soon.

24:47.919 --> 24:51.089
We were planning an event
for all the members anyway.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.730
Daelim Bank on line two.

24:59.270 --> 25:01.839
Sure. I'll call you back
once the schedule is set.

25:04.409 --> 25:05.540
This is Kim Da Li.

25:07.540 --> 25:10.349
No, it was a small mishap.

25:10.349 --> 25:11.609
It'll be over in no time.

25:12.179 --> 25:15.379
We'll deal with it soon
if you give us some time.

25:16.750 --> 25:18.649
Don't worry. Of course.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.490
Hey, girl!

25:22.859 --> 25:24.760
You saw it too?

25:25.129 --> 25:26.899
No, it's not like that.

25:27.800 --> 25:28.800
Yes.

(Cheongsong Museum of Art)

25:50.950 --> 25:52.550
Thank you, everyone.

25:53.389 --> 25:54.919
- Take care.
- Thank you.

25:54.919 --> 25:55.990
Thanks.

25:56.929 --> 25:58.060
Take care.

25:58.589 --> 25:59.629
Take care.

26:05.899 --> 26:08.399
Her first day was rough.

26:09.540 --> 26:11.070
A director should be able to handle
that much pressure.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.109
That...

26:15.379 --> 26:17.010
What's up with her?

26:17.750 --> 26:18.780
Not sure.

26:18.980 --> 26:21.280
What a day.

26:27.919 --> 26:30.530
I see you've made the money
since you're going home on time.

26:51.980 --> 26:53.179
Are you okay?

26:57.349 --> 26:58.450
Mr. Jin.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.790
- Mr. Jin.
- Yes.

27:03.129 --> 27:05.490
Yes.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.169
Why are you here again?

27:16.369 --> 27:19.510
I heard there was an incident.

27:20.210 --> 27:21.980
Are you here because
you were worried about me?

27:23.849 --> 27:25.179
Worried?

27:25.310 --> 27:28.480
I'm here to keep an eye on you
in case you run away with my money.

27:29.520 --> 27:30.550
Right.

27:31.149 --> 27:33.889
You told me not to act friendly...

27:34.260 --> 27:36.290
since our relationship is nothing
more than a debtor-creditor one.

27:37.329 --> 27:38.490
You know it.

27:41.730 --> 27:43.230
What's wrong this time?

27:44.570 --> 27:45.570
What...

27:52.409 --> 27:55.109
Why do you wear such things?

27:55.909 --> 27:58.810
Is it to win insurance money
from accident insurance?

27:59.619 --> 28:01.950
To me, these aren't pretty.

28:02.250 --> 28:03.649
They're just scary.

28:04.750 --> 28:07.320
My stuff hasn't arrived
from the Netherlands yet.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.659
These are the only heels I have.

28:15.329 --> 28:16.399
You...

28:17.770 --> 28:19.399
don't need to worry
too much about me.

28:21.899 --> 28:23.040
I don't...

28:23.770 --> 28:26.609
I'm not worried about you.

28:26.609 --> 28:28.179
Why would I be worried?

28:28.179 --> 28:29.409
Whether something
happens at the gallery,

28:29.409 --> 28:31.409
or whether you break your leg,
what does that have to do with me?

28:31.409 --> 28:32.480
No, I mean...

28:33.480 --> 28:35.079
You don't have to worry.

28:35.349 --> 28:36.950
I won't run away with your money.

28:44.730 --> 28:45.829
Stay here.

28:59.270 --> 29:00.710
Wear these for now.

29:02.010 --> 29:03.849
No, I'm fine. I can just do this.

29:05.849 --> 29:09.020
I don't want to owe you anything
since we aren't friends.

29:09.820 --> 29:10.820
I should go.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.720
You said a "thank you" was enough.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.560
That's what you said
in the Netherlands.

29:18.689 --> 29:20.260
That when someone is nice to you,

29:20.399 --> 29:22.629
saying "thank you" is enough.

29:45.389 --> 29:47.589
You really don't need to do this.

29:50.659 --> 29:52.790
Was that the day
you heard about your father?

29:54.230 --> 29:55.329
That day?

29:56.629 --> 29:59.530
When we parted in front of a hotel.

30:02.339 --> 30:03.439
I guess so.

30:05.139 --> 30:07.879
Everything happened so fast.

30:09.480 --> 30:12.079
I can't remember what came first
and what came after.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.649
How I even came back to Korea.

30:16.349 --> 30:18.520
How I went through with the funeral.

30:22.689 --> 30:25.389
That reminds me,
we were supposed to meet at the gallery.

30:31.929 --> 30:33.369
Did you wait long?

30:33.939 --> 30:36.939
No. Why would I wait for you?

30:37.339 --> 30:39.839
As I told you,
I had a tight schedule.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.010
I couldn't possibly make time,

30:42.010 --> 30:44.210
so I called to cancel,
but you didn't answer.

30:44.450 --> 30:47.419
I thought, "I guess she's busy,"
and stopped.

30:47.950 --> 30:49.020
Indifferently.

30:50.550 --> 30:53.520
You knew my phone number?

30:56.589 --> 30:57.689
Well...

30:59.460 --> 31:00.800
The library...

31:02.129 --> 31:03.800
The museum...

31:05.829 --> 31:07.970
I called the gallery.

31:08.500 --> 31:11.070
The gallery told you
my personal phone number?

31:12.169 --> 31:14.839
They did. When I told them
that I was your hometown friend.

31:16.179 --> 31:18.079
Oh, I see.

31:18.510 --> 31:20.919
I'm a businessman.
I'm not that stupid.

31:24.790 --> 31:26.659
- By the way...
- I'm serious!

31:26.659 --> 31:28.589
Did you think I hired
a private detective...

31:28.589 --> 31:30.329
to get one phone number?

31:32.189 --> 31:33.460
That's not it.

31:34.659 --> 31:35.960
We're here.

31:36.700 --> 31:39.730
You can drop me off over there.
Thank you.

31:41.839 --> 31:42.899
Okay.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.490
Let's see. Is it here?

32:08.230 --> 32:10.000
Are you following me right now?

32:11.869 --> 32:13.639
Don't flatter yourself.

32:13.639 --> 32:16.439
I'm looking to see if they have
new products while I'm here.

32:17.339 --> 32:19.980
I come here often.
I'm a diamond-level customer.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.939
I even have access
to the private lounge!

32:22.609 --> 32:23.609
Okay.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.379
Gosh.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.339
Was it on the third floor?

33:12.859 --> 33:14.300
I already told you...

33:14.300 --> 33:15.730
I wouldn't run away with your money.

33:16.869 --> 33:18.369
I was just...

33:22.439 --> 33:24.510
I wanted to get my shoes back.

33:24.510 --> 33:26.710
Those are precious to me, you know.

33:32.349 --> 33:35.079
Fine. You can give them back later.

33:35.679 --> 33:36.889
But promise me you will.

33:44.359 --> 33:47.260
What? Why?

33:47.260 --> 33:48.659
What's going on?

33:48.659 --> 33:50.070
What's wrong?

33:50.629 --> 33:51.669
What is it?

33:52.599 --> 33:53.970
What are you doing?

33:55.339 --> 33:56.639
What are you...

34:16.159 --> 34:18.728
I'm sorry. I must have startled you.

34:22.300 --> 34:24.668
Aren't you going to ask me
why I did that?

34:25.300 --> 34:26.629
Do I need to know?

34:27.339 --> 34:28.399
Well...

34:30.239 --> 34:31.938
You can go now.

34:33.478 --> 34:35.539
You might run into him again.
Are you sure?

34:35.909 --> 34:38.379
It didn't seem like he'd stay put.

34:38.978 --> 34:40.649
It's not like that.

34:44.820 --> 34:45.949
Let's go.

34:46.289 --> 34:48.659
Now that I'm already here,
I'll protect you to the end.

34:49.489 --> 34:52.159
Here. Come on.

35:01.970 --> 35:04.640
This store is extremely expensive.

35:04.740 --> 35:05.769
Sorry?

35:06.039 --> 35:07.640
I'm a regular here.

35:08.209 --> 35:10.180
Oh, my. You're here.

35:10.180 --> 35:12.609
It hasn't even been a week.
Don't overreact.

35:12.609 --> 35:15.080
- How long has it been?
- How have you been?

35:15.080 --> 35:16.080
Great, thanks to you.

35:16.180 --> 35:17.950
When did you
return from the Netherlands?

35:18.089 --> 35:19.490
Did you lose weight?

35:20.289 --> 35:21.820
I'm a regular here.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.589
Just a second.

35:23.689 --> 35:25.890
- Jung Won, please show him around.
- Yes, ma'am.

35:26.089 --> 35:28.999
We'll go over there.
It's a little loud here.

35:29.459 --> 35:30.999
Please follow me.

35:31.700 --> 35:34.140
- Jung Won, bring us tea.
- Yes, ma'am.

35:36.269 --> 35:38.709
- This way.
- You must have a new manager.

35:40.809 --> 35:43.709
That's the only pair left in Korea.

35:46.379 --> 35:47.979
The avant-garde style...

35:47.979 --> 35:49.879
would have suited you perfectly.

35:50.220 --> 35:51.490
It's a shame.

35:51.689 --> 35:53.149
What a load of garbage.

35:54.089 --> 35:55.820
They're for work.

35:56.789 --> 35:57.890
Sure.

36:01.999 --> 36:05.399
It says that this card is suspended.
Do you have a different card?

36:05.700 --> 36:06.870
Is it?

36:09.399 --> 36:10.539
Sorry.

36:10.809 --> 36:12.140
Not a problem.

36:15.010 --> 36:17.450
This one is also suspended.

36:18.850 --> 36:21.019
That can't be.

36:21.680 --> 36:22.780
Use this.

36:24.149 --> 36:25.249
Tae Jin.

36:25.390 --> 36:26.890
Pick out a few clothes for her,

36:26.890 --> 36:28.390
including shoes and a bag
to go with them.

36:28.390 --> 36:29.559
You know her sizes, right?

36:30.089 --> 36:32.959
- Of course.
- No. Don't do that.

36:33.559 --> 36:34.559
What are you doing?

36:35.399 --> 36:37.370
I know that you couldn't have
properly packed your things...

36:37.370 --> 36:38.370
since you rushed here.

36:38.669 --> 36:40.240
- Please get them ready.
- Yes, sir.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.740
No. Don't.

36:43.740 --> 36:45.470
It's none of your business.

36:46.109 --> 36:47.479
And we don't have that relationship.

36:50.680 --> 36:51.879
Mr. Jin?

36:53.149 --> 36:56.149
Why are you standing there?
You need to pay for this.

37:00.959 --> 37:03.789
Everyone is waiting.

37:14.370 --> 37:16.600
Sorry.
I was looking at the products.

37:16.740 --> 37:18.970
I wasn't listening. I should pay.

37:19.939 --> 37:21.979
Please use my card.

37:23.439 --> 37:24.550
Here you go.

37:27.419 --> 37:30.189
Oh, right. Just a second.

37:31.320 --> 37:32.649
You give a five-percent discount,
right?

37:33.890 --> 37:35.559
Not at our store, sir.

37:37.760 --> 37:39.930
Maybe it's for the one
next to this store.

37:43.499 --> 37:44.570
How much is it?

37:45.070 --> 37:47.169
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

37:53.609 --> 37:55.140
Can we talk for a minute?

37:55.609 --> 37:57.550
I can't today since I have company.

37:57.780 --> 37:59.350
I'll come to see you next time.

37:59.809 --> 38:01.379
I have something to tell you
as well.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.990
- Let's go.
- Sure thing.

38:34.120 --> 38:36.050
I know I'm a debtor, and I'm sorry.

38:36.419 --> 38:38.050
I'll make sure you pay you back.

38:38.550 --> 38:39.990
It's okay.

38:39.990 --> 38:42.490
It's late,
so why don't I drive you...

38:44.890 --> 38:48.229
Goodness. Were you not going
to pay me back, then?

39:44.519 --> 39:45.589
Tae Jin.

39:46.689 --> 39:48.059
Tae Jin.

39:49.990 --> 39:52.760
What do you mean,
"Let's call this thing off?"

39:53.830 --> 39:55.160
It's only a week.

39:55.700 --> 39:58.300
Our wedding is in a week.
Why are you doing this?

40:00.570 --> 40:03.669
I'm sorry for everything.
I'll fix all of it.

40:03.669 --> 40:05.309
I'll do anything you want.

40:07.780 --> 40:10.350
Please don't do this, Tae Jin.

40:10.709 --> 40:13.550
Look at me. I beg you.

40:13.749 --> 40:16.080
Please.

40:18.220 --> 40:19.320
Please.

40:26.789 --> 40:28.800
Are you sure you can do
anything I want?

40:31.470 --> 40:32.629
Yes, I can.

40:34.539 --> 40:35.700
Anything?

40:36.669 --> 40:37.870
Anything.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.350
Then...

41:30.480 --> 41:33.039
May I say something, sir?

41:34.780 --> 41:35.909
Given your past,

41:35.980 --> 41:38.219
what you did for her father's
funeral is understandable.

41:38.719 --> 41:40.320
But I don't think you should do
more than that, sir.

41:41.020 --> 41:43.489
There were many people
at the department store today.

41:43.650 --> 41:45.889
I wouldn't have started this
had I been worried about others.

41:47.329 --> 41:48.829
I'm not the person I was
five years ago.

41:50.699 --> 41:54.199
The reason I could endure
after hurting her that badly...

41:55.670 --> 41:58.000
was because I believed
I could win her back.

42:01.309 --> 42:02.739
I will get her back.

42:24.153 --> 42:25.423
Hello, Lawyer Cha.

42:29.253 --> 42:30.322
Is that so?

42:31.162 --> 42:33.992
I thought it'd take some time.
I'm glad it was sold.

42:33.992 --> 42:36.333
Please proceed with it.

42:39.162 --> 42:41.273
Sorry? Provisional attachment?

42:42.972 --> 42:45.242
Is that why my credit cards
were suspended?

42:47.713 --> 42:50.412
Could you tell me who did it?

42:55.813 --> 42:57.483
I see. Look.

42:59.182 --> 43:02.052
I'd like to move up
the date of the contract.

43:04.193 --> 43:06.162
No, it's fine by me.
I can move out...

43:07.262 --> 43:09.063
as soon as tomorrow.

43:11.403 --> 43:12.403
Thank you.

43:44.833 --> 43:47.903
(Da Li's Swing)

43:52.742 --> 43:54.912
All right. It's done.

43:55.273 --> 43:57.213
Gosh, it's my swing!

44:03.753 --> 44:06.282
You made this for me!

44:07.193 --> 44:09.853
- Gosh. It's so fun.
- Do you like it?

44:11.923 --> 44:13.423
- One more time?
- Yes.

44:13.423 --> 44:14.492
All right.

44:18.702 --> 44:19.733
It's so fun.

45:08.282 --> 45:11.423
F of X equals Y. X is 25.

45:29.233 --> 45:32.242
Da Li, have you been studying
and skipping your meals?

45:32.443 --> 45:34.242
How many days
did you starve this time?

45:34.242 --> 45:35.673
I didn't starve.

45:35.673 --> 45:37.782
Don't lie.

45:38.012 --> 45:41.713
A true adult never skips meals
or loses sleep.

46:57.662 --> 46:58.693
Excuse me.

47:07.273 --> 47:08.972
I'll go there right away.

47:24.983 --> 47:28.492
Excuse me for asking, okay?

47:28.992 --> 47:31.293
Can I ask what you do for a living?

47:32.092 --> 47:33.123
No.

47:33.362 --> 47:34.432
Hey.

47:34.992 --> 47:36.432
Unbelievable.

47:36.733 --> 47:38.063
What is it?

47:38.862 --> 47:41.873
I saw you this morning,
hanging out with some thugs.

47:41.873 --> 47:44.373
I advise that
you abide by the law...

47:44.543 --> 47:46.072
so that we won't meet again.

47:46.742 --> 47:48.873
What? Thugs?

47:49.412 --> 47:50.742
Abide by the law?

47:50.742 --> 47:55.353
You see, my body reacts
whenever I meet unethical people.

47:55.682 --> 47:58.353
Do you see that? Goosebumps.

48:00.052 --> 48:01.222
This means...

48:01.222 --> 48:03.492
there's a 99.9-percent possibility
that you're immoral.

48:04.923 --> 48:06.222
Be careful, okay?

48:07.862 --> 48:09.762
You may be my landlord,
but I still won't go easy on you.

48:16.873 --> 48:19.043
You should be careful
before I kick you out.

48:19.043 --> 48:21.572
I made it clear
that she can't come here again.

48:21.572 --> 48:23.612
Bring her back,

48:23.612 --> 48:25.882
and I'll double all your bills.

48:25.882 --> 48:26.943
Got that?

48:32.653 --> 48:33.653
That scumbag...

48:39.463 --> 48:40.833
Seriously?

48:51.643 --> 48:53.773
That little scumbag.

48:54.173 --> 48:57.612
What does he take
the Majang-dong Fighter for?

49:15.132 --> 49:17.532
Hey. No.

49:18.162 --> 49:21.173
You're her creditor,
and she's your debtor.

49:21.173 --> 49:24.202
You are her creditor.
And she, your debtor!

49:28.373 --> 49:31.043
Get a grip.

49:43.623 --> 49:45.963
Gosh.

49:46.162 --> 49:48.793
- Goodness.
- Come on.

49:50.662 --> 49:53.333
Let's do this right. Okay?
Suck in your belly.

49:53.333 --> 49:54.472
- I did.
- Are you kidding me?

49:54.472 --> 49:56.202
- Don't eat so much.
- He's here.

49:56.673 --> 49:58.572
- Good morning,
- Good morning,

49:58.572 --> 49:59.673
- sir.
- Sir.

50:00.043 --> 50:01.112
What...

50:10.782 --> 50:12.083
What was that?

50:14.592 --> 50:15.793
Perfect, right?

50:16.293 --> 50:17.862
They must've thought
they looked too soft yesterday.

50:17.862 --> 50:19.492
So they practiced a little.

50:20.222 --> 50:21.632
Good job.

50:24.162 --> 50:25.403
Are we doing it again today?

50:26.162 --> 50:28.333
Are you seriously asking me that?

50:28.333 --> 50:29.632
You told us not to skip a day...

50:29.632 --> 50:31.572
until we get every cent
of the money back.

50:31.903 --> 50:33.072
I mean...

50:33.943 --> 50:35.472
What about the kitchen?

50:35.813 --> 50:37.043
Don't you have to run a restaurant?

50:37.043 --> 50:38.782
Don't worry, sir.

50:38.782 --> 50:41.282
We already prepped everything
this morning.

50:42.552 --> 50:44.722
You don't have to work
so hard like that.

50:46.282 --> 50:48.893
I got a call that all the money
in the bank account was seized too.

50:49.193 --> 50:50.563
The bank account?

50:51.162 --> 50:53.322
The bank account for the gallery.

50:53.492 --> 50:55.992
We should get it done
before others take all the money.

50:57.563 --> 50:58.702
What?

51:02.333 --> 51:05.773
It says that this card is suspended.
Do you have a different card?

51:06.072 --> 51:07.173
Is it?

51:09.773 --> 51:10.943
Sorry.

51:11.182 --> 51:12.443
Not a problem.

51:15.353 --> 51:17.782
This one is also suspended.

51:21.992 --> 51:24.393
We must strike
while the iron is hot.

51:24.393 --> 51:26.963
We need to make sure
she has no way to run.

51:26.963 --> 51:29.233
That way,
we can go back to our day job.

51:29.233 --> 51:32.032
And we'll finally mark
our presence in the global market!

51:32.032 --> 51:33.032
Yes!

51:34.302 --> 51:36.572
I didn't ask you to do that!

51:40.302 --> 51:42.443
All right. Let's get going.

51:42.612 --> 51:44.112
- Get going.
- Hey.

51:44.242 --> 51:45.742
- Let's get in.
- Okay.

51:45.983 --> 51:47.612
<i>- Don't criticize</i>
<i>- Don't criticize</i>

51:47.612 --> 51:49.353
<i>- My cowardice</i>
<i>- My cowardice</i>

51:49.353 --> 51:52.822
<i>- I might be roaming the back alley</i>
<i>- I might be roaming the back alley</i>

51:52.822 --> 51:54.592
<i>- But I'm happy</i>
<i>- But I'm happy</i>

51:54.592 --> 51:56.322
<i>- To have you by my side</i>
<i>- To have you by my side</i>

51:56.322 --> 51:59.592
<i>- And that you embraced my pain</i>
<i>- And that you embraced my pain</i>

51:59.592 --> 52:01.362
<i>- Our love was fleeting</i>
<i>- Our love was fleeting</i>

52:01.362 --> 52:03.262
<i>- Like the flame</i>
<i>- Like the flame</i>

52:03.262 --> 52:06.563
<i>- I wanted to give you everything</i>
<i>- I wanted to give you everything</i>

52:06.563 --> 52:10.003
<i>- But the moment I lose my luck</i>
<i>- But the moment I lose my luck</i>

52:10.003 --> 52:13.072
<i>- My happy days would be over</i>
<i>- My happy days would be over</i>

52:13.342 --> 52:15.512
As for this exhibit,

52:15.512 --> 52:18.512
we can try to make art
more accessible for the audience.

52:18.682 --> 52:20.412
And the theme for this one is...

52:20.412 --> 52:21.753
As long as the conditions are good,

52:22.282 --> 52:23.512
I'd love to go.

52:26.322 --> 52:28.923
This could have a friendly vibe.

52:30.492 --> 52:33.563
This is bad.
Those guys from yesterday are back.

52:34.693 --> 52:36.932
Those thugs!

52:37.432 --> 52:40.063
Mr. Han, don't just sit there.
Go out there.

52:40.333 --> 52:41.733
By myself?

52:42.302 --> 52:44.143
You know what?
I'll see you out there.

52:44.143 --> 52:46.503
I should call the police first.

52:46.503 --> 52:48.373
Come on! Go now.

52:49.713 --> 52:52.282
Where's Mr. Hwang?
He was here a moment ago.

52:52.282 --> 52:53.782
- Mr. Han.
- Yes.

52:53.782 --> 52:55.753
- Don't call the police.
- Okay.

52:56.153 --> 52:57.452
Don't even think about it.

52:57.452 --> 52:59.552
Things might get worse
if you try to handle it yourself.

52:59.552 --> 53:01.052
We should let the police
do their job.

53:02.893 --> 53:05.563
Director Kim. No. Goodness.

53:06.023 --> 53:07.432
Mr. Hwang!

53:07.632 --> 53:09.333
Gosh. Come on.

53:11.103 --> 53:12.563
Whatever. You take care of it.

53:12.563 --> 53:14.472
- Mr. Jin.
- You brought them here.

53:16.873 --> 53:19.072
Pay back the money.

53:19.072 --> 53:21.242
- Pay back the money.
- Pay back the money.

53:21.242 --> 53:23.443
Pay back the money.

53:23.443 --> 53:25.512
- Pay back the money.
- Pay back the money.

53:25.512 --> 53:27.512
Pay back the money.

53:27.512 --> 53:29.612
- Pay back the money.
- Pay back the money.

53:29.612 --> 53:31.583
Pay back the money.

53:31.583 --> 53:33.782
- Pay back the money.
- Pay back the money.

53:33.782 --> 53:36.393
- Pay back the...
- Pay back...

53:36.793 --> 53:37.992
the money.

54:04.353 --> 54:06.353
We bought the tickets today.

54:10.153 --> 54:12.162
Thank you
for visiting our gallery again.

54:12.563 --> 54:14.932
Admiring the artwork
on your back is a great method.

54:15.432 --> 54:18.103
Why don't we go
with a different method today?

54:18.103 --> 54:19.362
- What?
- What?

54:21.103 --> 54:22.302
What?

54:25.043 --> 54:26.143
Gosh.

54:27.972 --> 54:30.612
No. Wait.

54:36.952 --> 54:39.123
Let's go
with a different method today.

54:39.123 --> 54:40.552
Instead of lying on your back...

54:43.793 --> 54:46.362
- I won't do it!
- There's no space.

54:46.523 --> 54:48.492
- Come on.
- Okay.

54:54.472 --> 54:57.333
- Hurry.
- Sit on this, please.

55:21.162 --> 55:24.092
I hope you enjoy our exhibit.

55:30.503 --> 55:32.202
Wait. Miss.

55:32.603 --> 55:36.412
Come on. How can you call her Miss?

55:36.873 --> 55:39.643
She's Ms. Barista.

55:39.912 --> 55:42.253
- Right?
- She's a curator.

55:42.253 --> 55:43.282
What?

55:43.452 --> 55:45.583
Do you have a question?

55:46.282 --> 55:48.693
What is this painting about?

56:00.762 --> 56:02.302
What do you see?

56:03.702 --> 56:06.342
The overall color is red.

56:06.342 --> 56:09.773
But I also see some hints
of black and blue here and there.

56:11.782 --> 56:13.282
That must be spicy chicken.

56:13.282 --> 56:15.112
The one with a lot of dried lavers.

56:15.483 --> 56:17.682
- You're so ignorant.
- I guess that's one interpretation.

56:17.822 --> 56:19.682
Isn't this a flower?

56:19.682 --> 56:22.023
I think it's a flower.

56:22.853 --> 56:25.123
- Gosh. No way.
- How is that a flower?

56:25.123 --> 56:28.293
Yes. I can see why you say that.

56:30.233 --> 56:31.302
All right, then.

56:34.572 --> 56:37.532
- I think that looks like pizza.
- I should try that.

56:37.532 --> 56:40.403
What was that?
Was she patronizing us?

56:40.673 --> 56:42.813
That barista just looked down
on us, right?

56:42.813 --> 56:46.443
No. That's not it.
Ms. Barista must have said that...

56:46.713 --> 56:49.313
because she also doesn't know
what this means.

56:49.682 --> 56:52.682
I see. That barista
didn't know either.

56:52.682 --> 56:53.753
- Right.
- I see.

56:53.753 --> 56:55.623
So what if we can't figure out
what this means?

56:55.623 --> 56:58.362
It's beautiful to look at.

56:58.722 --> 57:01.432
Gosh. I'm craving spicy chicken.

57:01.432 --> 57:03.233
- All you ever think about is food.
- Really?

57:03.233 --> 57:06.003
- No. It's pizza.
- It's not chicken. It's a flower.

57:06.003 --> 57:08.733
- I'm telling you. It's a flower.
- That makes no sense.

57:08.773 --> 57:10.472
Let's go and have spicy chicken.

57:27.753 --> 57:31.193
I'm not playing hooky right now.
I'm working.

57:32.262 --> 57:33.822
They prepped everything
early in the morning.

57:33.822 --> 57:36.063
So there's no problem. Don't worry.

57:37.592 --> 57:40.733
Gosh. I told you
that I would get the money back.

57:40.733 --> 57:42.733
I'll get every single cent of it.

57:43.103 --> 57:44.233
Bye.

57:45.443 --> 57:47.943
Gosh. That old man.

57:48.112 --> 57:49.313
Mr. Jin.

57:50.242 --> 57:51.242
Hey.

57:59.222 --> 58:01.693
Did you get home safely yesterday?

58:02.253 --> 58:03.893
Yes. Thanks to you.

58:11.032 --> 58:13.403
- What's this?
- It's for yesterday's purchase.

58:14.233 --> 58:15.273
I see.

58:15.532 --> 58:18.673
I'm sorry. And thank you.

58:19.403 --> 58:20.603
It was nothing.

58:21.443 --> 58:24.382
I always end up
indebted to you, Mr. Jin.

58:27.682 --> 58:31.452
I'll do my best to pay back
the rest as soon as possible.

58:31.452 --> 58:34.052
I know you must be anxious and upset.

58:34.793 --> 58:36.052
And I know I'm asking a lot.

58:36.452 --> 58:38.862
But could you give me
a bit more time?

58:41.432 --> 58:44.762
Listen. It's not that simple.

58:44.762 --> 58:46.903
I'll meet all the demands you make.

58:46.903 --> 58:48.972
Whatever they are, I'll accept them.

58:48.972 --> 58:50.173
Please...

58:51.143 --> 58:52.603
Please give me a bit more time.

58:52.603 --> 58:54.103
Tell the director to come out!

58:54.103 --> 58:55.512
- Where's she?
- Come on out!

58:55.512 --> 58:57.782
- Where is she? Come on out!
- Come on out!

58:58.012 --> 58:59.612
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

58:59.713 --> 59:02.882
- Where is she?
- Tell her to come out!

59:03.182 --> 59:04.313
What's going on?

59:04.882 --> 59:07.523
- Give back my money!
- Come on out!

59:07.682 --> 59:09.452
- Come on.
- Get out of my way!

59:12.693 --> 59:14.222
- What are you doing?
- Where is the director?

59:14.222 --> 59:16.233
- Mr. Jung!
- Where is she?

59:16.432 --> 59:18.632
We still have time until the deadline.
What is this?

59:18.632 --> 59:21.072
I know we're small-business owners.
But you can't get away with this!

59:21.072 --> 59:22.403
This isn't fair!

59:22.572 --> 59:25.643
Don't just stand there.
Take anything that could be of value.

59:25.643 --> 59:28.112
- Wait.
- Please don't do this.

59:28.112 --> 59:30.773
Please stop.
Cheongsong Gallery will not be shut down!

59:30.773 --> 59:32.043
Nonsense!

59:32.242 --> 59:33.983
Everyone knows about it!

59:33.983 --> 59:37.713
We take all this junk,
and it'll only go to waste.

59:37.713 --> 59:39.322
We need to take things
that are of value!

59:39.322 --> 59:41.423
He's right.
In this place, paintings have value.

59:41.423 --> 59:44.193
Let's take the paintings
before they're seized!

59:44.193 --> 59:46.162
- Let's go.
- Please stop.

59:46.162 --> 59:48.293
- Please don't do this.
- Get off of me!

59:50.932 --> 59:53.362
What do you think you're doing?
Stop it this instant.

59:53.563 --> 59:55.333
Who are you? Get out of the way!

59:55.333 --> 59:57.733
Ms. Na. Call the police.

59:58.873 --> 01:00:01.143
- I'm sorry?
- Call the police now.

01:00:02.213 --> 01:00:03.242
Yes, ma'am.

01:00:04.012 --> 01:00:05.112
The police?

01:00:05.443 --> 01:00:08.313
We're the ones who should call
the police. I ought to...

01:00:08.713 --> 01:00:11.353
- Oh, my.
- That hurts! Who are you?

01:00:12.552 --> 01:00:14.822
That hurts! Let go of my hand.

01:00:14.822 --> 01:00:18.162
You have to let go of her first
so that I can let go.

01:00:20.822 --> 01:00:23.233
Let's use our words.

01:00:23.833 --> 01:00:25.432
This is a gallery.

01:00:25.432 --> 01:00:27.603
Get your hand off of me!

01:00:48.025 --> 01:00:50.366
Do you know how expensive this is?

01:00:51.293 --> 01:00:52.662
Who are you?

01:00:53.222 --> 01:00:54.362
What do you do?

01:00:55.333 --> 01:00:56.362
Me?

01:00:57.132 --> 01:00:59.463
I'm the new director
of this gallery.

01:01:00.103 --> 01:01:01.173
What?

01:01:02.505 --> 01:01:05.216
For how much are you causing this scene?

01:01:08.873 --> 01:01:09.873
Wait.

01:01:14.713 --> 01:01:16.782
Mr. Jin, here.

01:01:19.083 --> 01:01:20.222
Three thousand dollars.

01:01:20.222 --> 01:01:21.322
Four thousand five hundred dollars.

01:01:21.923 --> 01:01:23.092
Two thousand eight hundred dollars.

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:24.822
Six thousand nine hundred dollars.

01:01:28.963 --> 01:01:31.833
I can just pay you this much!

01:02:09.072 --> 01:02:12.773
(Da Li and Cocky Prince)

01:02:12.842 --> 01:02:14.043
Can you...

01:02:14.713 --> 01:02:16.673
sell your father?

01:02:16.673 --> 01:02:18.583
This gallery is my father.

01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:20.813
What a load of garbage!

01:02:21.313 --> 01:02:23.313
- Do you have the money?
- I can pay you back.

01:02:23.313 --> 01:02:25.822
I promise to pay you back in a week.

01:02:26.523 --> 01:02:28.222
- Hey.
- Not that money.

01:02:28.222 --> 01:02:29.222
Get lost.

01:02:29.693 --> 01:02:32.793
When you're in need of help,
I'll be right by your side.

01:02:32.992 --> 01:02:34.762
That bothers me.

01:02:35.432 --> 01:02:38.403
What gives you the right to become
the director of our gallery?

01:02:38.403 --> 01:02:40.603
Because I'm amazing at making money.

01:02:40.802 --> 01:02:41.932
All you care about is money.

01:02:42.833 --> 01:02:44.873
Yet you're handsome.
