01:00.405 --> 01:02.273
Six times three.

01:04.271 --> 01:06.040
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

01:07.338 --> 01:08.338
Hurry up.

01:09.672 --> 01:11.840
It's eighteen. Ooh!

01:24.672 --> 01:26.007
Ring the bell three times,

01:26.072 --> 01:28.775
put your helmet on the ground.
You're done.

01:36.173 --> 01:38.108
Commence! You don't make
it, you do it again!

01:38.173 --> 01:39.874
You ever been tested this
hard ever in your life?

01:39.939 --> 01:40.973
Never.

01:43.174 --> 01:45.842
Winning here is a
conscious decision.

01:48.107 --> 01:50.275
Make up your mind
if you want to pass

01:52.007 --> 01:53.842
or choose to fail.

01:54.874 --> 01:56.709
All right now, gentlemen,
I'm gonna introduce y'all

01:56.773 --> 01:59.610
to something called "not
being able to breathe."

02:03.007 --> 02:05.143
Andrew! Come back.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.708
Come back to the light.

02:12.108 --> 02:14.376
All this shaking and all
this cold. Harness it.

02:14.441 --> 02:15.675
Turn it into aggression.

02:27.175 --> 02:29.877
You just proved to your
bodies, through your mind,

02:31.209 --> 02:33.978
that you can push yourself further
than you thought possible.

02:45.009 --> 02:46.344
Go get wet! Run!

02:48.510 --> 02:50.111
I'm at my limit, so...

02:51.010 --> 02:52.344
...that's it.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.878
You sure you want to be here?
Yes, I do.

02:57.943 --> 02:59.177
Are you absolutely sure?

02:59.243 --> 03:00.510
I'm positive!

03:09.511 --> 03:11.011
Whatever you have to do!

03:13.111 --> 03:14.778
Just find an excuse to win.

03:16.944 --> 03:18.278
Keep going.

03:20.111 --> 03:21.879
It pays to be a winner!

03:28.677 --> 03:31.181
I like having my buddies
that I can depend on.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.480
And I would like for them
to be able to depend on me.

03:34.011 --> 03:35.746
These guys are our
band of brothers.

03:38.677 --> 03:42.015
 Silent night

03:42.678 --> 03:45.681
 Holy night

03:46.678 --> 03:49.681
 All is calm

03:50.678 --> 03:53.349
 All is bright.

04:58.515 --> 05:00.683
There's a storm inside of us.

05:07.448 --> 05:10.118
I've heard many team
guys speak of this.

05:13.749 --> 05:15.083
A burning.

05:19.749 --> 05:21.083
A river.

05:23.649 --> 05:25.218
A drive.

05:33.350 --> 05:35.251
An unrelenting desire
to push yourself

05:35.317 --> 05:37.919
harder and further than
anyone could think possible.

05:45.285 --> 05:48.121
Pushing ourselves into
those cold, dark corners.

05:51.051 --> 05:53.052
Where the bad things live.

05:55.517 --> 05:57.519
Where the bad things fight.

06:01.618 --> 06:03.653
We wanted that Fight
at the highest volume.

06:10.919 --> 06:12.352
Aloud fight.

06:14.319 --> 06:16.854
The loudest, coldest, darkest,

06:16.919 --> 06:19.321
most unpleasant of the
unpleasant fights.

08:36.357 --> 08:37.892
Is this doable?

08:42.924 --> 08:44.092
It's expensive.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.693
How much?

08:46.926 --> 08:50.763
It's an Arabian horse, man.
She got good taste.

08:51.525 --> 08:52.860
I know.

08:53.626 --> 08:54.626
How much?

08:55.659 --> 08:58.328
I'll find out. Expensive.

08:59.192 --> 09:00.227
You're fucked, man.

09:03.693 --> 09:05.028
I know.

09:22.627 --> 09:24.129
I'm up.

09:27.227 --> 09:28.394
Going down.

11:13.999 --> 11:15.333
Murphy by 1.1.

11:16.699 --> 11:18.367
More than that. More
than that, Marcus.

11:18.432 --> 11:20.433
Fucking dude, I was being
generous. Trust me.

11:20.899 --> 11:21.967
Who won?

11:22.532 --> 11:25.101
Murph. Murph, barely.
By one second.

11:25.165 --> 11:26.165
Barely.

11:26.766 --> 11:28.099
Barely. Head shave?

11:28.165 --> 11:30.902
Head shave or what? I don't know, you
know? It's something to think about.

11:30.966 --> 11:33.033
If I shave his head, I
have to focus on his face.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.002
Face, ears. Oddly-shaped head.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.435
Well, I don't wanna be looking
at him that close, either,

11:38.500 --> 11:40.858
but he has been running his mouth
about beating you. Really?

11:41.066 --> 11:42.400
Fuck, a head shave is fair.

11:42.967 --> 11:44.600
Axe? Better shave him.

11:44.666 --> 11:48.503
Make him go eat with the E-3s, work
in the chow hall until it grows back.

11:48.567 --> 11:49.701
Frankie, what do you think?

11:49.767 --> 11:51.126
Why the fuck wouldn't
we shave him?

11:51.333 --> 11:52.333
That's valid.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.135
Patton, not that we care,
but what do you think?

11:54.200 --> 11:56.870
Let me see you make a
tactical decision right now.

11:56.934 --> 11:59.001
Well, I could go
both ways on this.

11:59.267 --> 12:00.668
He did lose, but he was close.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.903
And you're Mike Murphy.

12:02.968 --> 12:04.468
You are Mike Murphy.

12:04.534 --> 12:05.635
The Mike Murphy.

12:05.701 --> 12:07.302
I would've expected a
bigger separation.

12:07.367 --> 12:09.636
That is a good point.
Backhanded compliment.

12:09.702 --> 12:11.603
Patton. Grab my razor.

12:11.668 --> 12:12.668
Razor, copy that.

12:13.868 --> 12:15.001
Listen up.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.737
Red Wings' a go.
Tonight, 1800.

12:21.568 --> 12:22.602
Beautiful.

12:22.735 --> 12:23.769
Am I going?

12:23.835 --> 12:25.369
PLO in an hour.

12:29.235 --> 12:30.235
Maybe I'll go.

12:30.301 --> 12:33.606
It's a maybe. I'll give you
a maybe. Stay optimistic.

12:35.569 --> 12:36.937
Boys. Hey, what's up?

12:37.636 --> 12:38.937
What the fuck am
I doing wrong?

12:40.569 --> 12:41.870
Oh, come on.

12:41.936 --> 12:43.814
I'll tell you what, Shane,
here's your first op.

12:44.569 --> 12:45.670
You ready?

12:46.937 --> 12:48.037
Clean all this up.

12:58.637 --> 13:02.106
The objective of this mission is
to capture and kill Ahmad Shah.

13:03.504 --> 13:05.706
Bad guy. Senior
Taliban commander

13:05.770 --> 13:08.806
responsible for killing Marines
in eastern Afghanistan.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.104
A Tier I target.

13:10.170 --> 13:14.507
If you want a positive I.D.,
note that Shah has no earlobes.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.238
Taraq.

13:19.303 --> 13:22.073
His right-hand man. Seems to do
most of his chief shit for him.

13:29.071 --> 13:31.273
We're going in with a
four-man Recon team.

13:31.505 --> 13:34.341
Axelson, you'll be point.
Myself, I'll be second.

13:34.404 --> 13:37.074
Dietz, comms.
Marcus, rear, med.

13:37.772 --> 13:39.072
Axe, give us our route.

13:39.138 --> 13:41.441
We're gonna be moving up the
back side of this Mountain here,

13:41.506 --> 13:43.974
which is gonna offer great
concealment from the village.

13:44.772 --> 13:46.939
I'm estimating that it's
gonna take us between

13:47.005 --> 13:50.242
three and four hours, depending
upon the gradient of the terrain

13:50.305 --> 13:52.876
which is that crappy shale.

13:53.339 --> 13:54.940
So please lace up.

14:01.072 --> 14:03.442
First things first. You're
gonna win the fight.

14:04.373 --> 14:05.741
No medicine in a gun fight.

14:05.806 --> 14:08.276
Two weeks ago, Team 8 was
near where we're gonna be.

14:08.740 --> 14:10.018
Capelli got bit
by a rattlesnake.

14:10.273 --> 14:12.341
Contrary to popular belief,
there is poison oak,

14:12.406 --> 14:14.444
so watch your cock and balls,
'cause that will suck.

14:19.540 --> 14:21.108
Murph's got the sat phone.

14:21.173 --> 14:24.777
The angle of this region is very
steep. Expect typical comms problems.

14:24.841 --> 14:26.942
We're gonna be on
two-hour comms windows.

14:27.007 --> 14:31.077
If we miss two windows, I'd say wake
somebody up. If not, don't sweat it.

14:31.374 --> 14:34.577
Way point one is Budweiser.
Way point two is Miller.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.675
Three is Corona.
Four is Heineken.

14:36.741 --> 14:38.976
And for our O.P. 1,
Schlitz Malt Liquor.

14:39.041 --> 14:42.043
And if and when we I.D.
Shah, pass Rick James.

14:50.874 --> 14:54.311
Gentlemen, these are your Rules of
Engagement. US forces will comply

14:54.375 --> 14:56.477
with the Law of Armed
Conflict at all times.

14:56.542 --> 14:58.076
Use of deadly force
is authorized.

15:00.375 --> 15:01.642
Allahu Akbar!

15:02.475 --> 15:03.809
If you do come under attack,

15:04.342 --> 15:08.145
use the appropriate force necessary
to deter or defeat that threat.

15:15.842 --> 15:20.747
Leaving here at 1800. Two
Chinooks and two Apaches.

15:20.943 --> 15:24.946
We fly here to the L.Z., insert
the four-man team right here.

15:25.476 --> 15:28.145
Then we fly 30
minutes to J-Bad.

15:29.176 --> 15:32.413
Here, we'll have 15 team guys

15:32.477 --> 15:34.679
and about a dozen Marines
standing by all night.

15:34.744 --> 15:38.913
When we hear "Schlitz Malt
Liquor", we're heading back

15:39.277 --> 15:41.278
to Ba-gram for phase two.

15:42.511 --> 15:45.347
The QRF will stay
here at J-Bad.

15:46.011 --> 15:48.346
Now the Apaches stay
with the Black Hawks.

15:48.612 --> 15:51.847
The movement is so we can
get the 47's back here

15:52.344 --> 15:55.347
ready to bring up to phrase
two, once you get eyes on Shah.

15:55.411 --> 15:56.646
Oh,

15:56.712 --> 16:00.449
I bringing up tomorrow night's new
guy presentation to 1400 today,

16:00.512 --> 16:03.847
so that all may
revel and partake.

16:04.645 --> 16:06.146
You better be good, Napoleon.

16:06.278 --> 16:07.278
Fuck.

16:07.878 --> 16:10.213
A lot of moving parts.

16:20.878 --> 16:22.846
We were going to wait and then
she gets her head into it

16:22.911 --> 16:25.448
and when she gets her head
into something, that's it.

16:25.513 --> 16:28.249
There's no stopping her, man.
She's going all out.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.214
You know, you should
just let her do it.

16:30.479 --> 16:32.615
You got a handyman woman.
That's a good thing.

16:33.179 --> 16:35.515
He's afraid of losing
control over his castle.

16:35.714 --> 16:37.081
He's having control issues
'cause he's the one

16:37.146 --> 16:39.114
who's always made the taste
decisions in the family, right?

16:39.179 --> 16:42.349
No, she's got great taste.
I... I trust her.

16:42.413 --> 16:43.481
Well, what does she like?

16:44.979 --> 16:46.014
Rose Honeydew.

16:47.514 --> 16:49.082
Oh. Is that a color?

16:49.147 --> 16:50.147
Mm-mmm.

16:51.180 --> 16:52.514
You better control
that situation.

16:52.780 --> 16:54.148
It's very ongoing.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.316
New grass leads to new
bushes by the windows,

16:56.380 --> 16:58.782
leads to new curtains,
leads to new sofa,

16:58.847 --> 17:00.649
leads to new carpet,
leads to new floor.

17:00.714 --> 17:01.848
New baby.

17:01.913 --> 17:03.592
Dude, she's pregnant?
How far along is she?

17:03.648 --> 17:04.848
You know if it's
a boy or a girl?

17:04.913 --> 17:07.384
No, she's not pregnant. She's
just on a weird journey,

17:07.448 --> 17:09.916
moving through the house,
one room to the next.

17:09.981 --> 17:11.582
Sounds expensive.
Sounds pregnant.

17:11.647 --> 17:13.583
Congratulations.

17:23.214 --> 17:24.317
You're fucking late.

17:24.948 --> 17:26.015
Sir, I'm good to go.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.115
No.

17:27.648 --> 17:29.750
You should introduce yourself

17:29.814 --> 17:31.614
and tell us something
about you we don't know.

17:32.582 --> 17:33.682
All right. Petty Officer...

17:33.748 --> 17:35.016
Oh, shut up!

17:36.282 --> 17:37.349
Get out!

17:37.416 --> 17:38.850
Shut the fuck up!

17:39.016 --> 17:40.016
Hey. Settle down.

17:40.115 --> 17:42.354
Give the kid a chance. Remember
what it was like for you.

17:45.182 --> 17:47.050
Petty Officer...

17:47.115 --> 17:48.551
Who gives a shit!

17:48.849 --> 17:50.351
Shut the fuck up!

17:51.616 --> 17:53.118
Mr. Patton, please.

18:12.351 --> 18:13.618
There we go.

18:16.518 --> 18:17.518
More neck.

18:18.918 --> 18:21.787
Come on, dude, you got to
get into it. Lose yourself.

18:21.851 --> 18:22.851
Yeah!

18:23.751 --> 18:24.751
Whoa!

18:25.851 --> 18:27.285
Whoo!

18:37.019 --> 18:38.220
Really, really bad.

18:38.419 --> 18:39.586
Dude, that was traumatizing.

18:39.651 --> 18:41.120
Can we vote to
push him through?

18:41.185 --> 18:42.252
Because I can't see
that ever again.

18:42.485 --> 18:44.720
Hands up. Push him through!

18:44.785 --> 18:46.453
I don't know. Can he say it?

18:46.520 --> 18:48.254
Can you say it? Prove it!

18:48.318 --> 18:50.555
I don't want to watch you
dance again. I really don't.

18:50.618 --> 18:51.698
Can you say it, Mr. Patton?

18:51.752 --> 18:53.254
I can say it, I can say it.

18:55.486 --> 18:56.986
Uh... Don't fuck it up.

19:02.253 --> 19:04.788
Come on. No more fucking around.
Come on.

19:08.053 --> 19:11.055
Been around the world twice.
Talked to everyone once.

19:11.454 --> 19:13.788
Seen two whales fuck. Been
to three world fairs.

19:14.853 --> 19:17.289
I even know a man in
Thailand with a wooden cock.

19:17.521 --> 19:20.623
I push more Peter more
sweeter and more completer

19:20.686 --> 19:22.488
than any other Peter
pusher around.

19:24.854 --> 19:26.822
I'm a hard-bodied,
hairy-chested,

19:26.887 --> 19:29.189
rooting tooting shooting,
parac' hutting

19:29.254 --> 19:31.990
demolition double-cap
crimping frogman.

19:32.522 --> 19:33.722
There ain't nothing
I can't do.

19:33.787 --> 19:36.524
No sky too high, no sea too
rough, no muff too tough.

19:37.854 --> 19:39.622
Learned a lot of
lessons in my life.

19:40.787 --> 19:43.957
Never shoot a large-caliber man
with a small-caliber bullet.

19:44.955 --> 19:46.790
Drive all kinds of trucks.

19:46.855 --> 19:49.057
Two-bys, four-bys, six-bys.

19:49.922 --> 19:52.958
And those big motherfuckers
that bend and go, "ssh-ssh"

19:53.022 --> 19:54.690
when you step on the brakes.

19:55.621 --> 19:59.058
Anything in life worth doing is worth
overdoing. Moderation is for cowards.

19:59.121 --> 20:03.126
I'm a lover, I'm a fighter,
I'm a UDT Navy SEAL diver.

20:03.522 --> 20:05.157
I'll wine, dine, intertwine,

20:05.223 --> 20:07.491
and sneak out the back door
when the refueling is done.

20:08.189 --> 20:10.147
So if you're feeling froggy,
then you better jump,

20:10.189 --> 20:13.458
because this frogman's been there,
done that and is going back for more.

20:13.522 --> 20:14.523
Cheers, boys.

20:29.190 --> 20:31.358
She does not need
an Arabian horse!

20:32.523 --> 20:33.923
How the fuck do you
know about that?

20:33.924 --> 20:35.959
I know everything, Murphy.

20:40.790 --> 20:43.726
More a Tennessee
Walker cross stallion.

20:44.191 --> 20:46.859
The original Silver. The
Lone Ranger's horse.

20:46.990 --> 20:48.258
No shit.

20:49.358 --> 20:52.693
Glorious horse, Murphy.
Glorious!

20:59.025 --> 21:03.529
Razor 11, 64 is two Mikes out.
Establish over watch at 1000 AGL.

21:11.192 --> 21:12.860
All right, Commander,
approaching the L.Z.

21:12.926 --> 21:13.993
One Mike on the deck.

21:14.458 --> 21:15.692
One minute!

21:23.625 --> 21:24.727
Thirty seconds.

21:24.792 --> 21:25.792
Thirty seconds!

21:29.426 --> 21:32.762
Roger. Establish over
watch at 5000 MSL.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.495
Bruno 64 will be a fast rope
infill. Stand by, Commander.

21:38.326 --> 21:39.895
Good Hoyer. Hold your hover.

21:40.693 --> 21:42.194
Rope's deployed.

21:42.793 --> 21:44.227
First team member on rope.

21:44.293 --> 21:45.395
Go!

21:51.860 --> 21:53.528
First man on the ground.

21:53.793 --> 21:55.128
Second man on the rope.

21:55.194 --> 21:56.761
Hey. Next one, Shane, okay?

21:57.094 --> 21:59.362
Have fun, you lucky bastard!

22:11.195 --> 22:14.864
Lulu 06, Bruno 64

22:39.030 --> 22:42.532

22:44.362 --> 22:46.397
Spartan O-1, this
is Apollo 2-2.

22:46.462 --> 22:49.098
We'll be with you for the next
six hours. Have a nice walk.

22:49.563 --> 22:52.432
Apollo 2-2, this is Spartan O-1.
Copy.

22:52.629 --> 22:53.964
Comms check. Check.

22:54.363 --> 22:55.397
Check.

22:55.696 --> 22:56.863
Check.

22:58.930 --> 23:01.666
Spartan O-1, I passed Budweiser.
How copy?

23:02.197 --> 23:05.566
Spartan O-1, Apollo 2-2.
Good copy. Budweiser.

23:19.198 --> 23:20.865
Apollo 2-2.

23:21.397 --> 23:24.234
Spartan O-1 hit Miller.

23:28.397 --> 23:30.233
Sir, Spartan O-1
passes Miller.

23:30.698 --> 23:34.034
Spartan O-1, Spartan base.
I copy. Miller.

23:44.865 --> 23:47.467
Apollo 2-2, Spartan O-1.

23:48.199 --> 23:49.699
It's Corona.

23:49.966 --> 23:52.034
Looks like they're doing
pretty good, Chief.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.035
Apollo 2... Spartan O-1.

24:04.100 --> 24:05.433
It's Hein...

24:06.533 --> 24:07.968
Say again, your last?

24:08.200 --> 24:10.534
Spartan O-1. Here's Heineken.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.001
How copy?

24:12.067 --> 24:13.300
Good copy.

24:13.366 --> 24:14.968
Spartan O-1 passes Heineken.

25:20.836 --> 25:22.672
It's the final way point.
Call it in.

25:26.836 --> 25:30.540
Spartan Base, this is
Spartan O-1. Radio check.

25:31.670 --> 25:33.938
Spartan... Spartan O-1.

25:36.004 --> 25:39.706
Spartan O-1, this is Beast master. Say
again. You're weak and unreadable.

25:42.503 --> 25:44.005
Take a peek.

25:47.303 --> 25:48.438
Spartan Base.

25:48.504 --> 25:49.504
Shit.

25:50.104 --> 25:51.183
Can't see half the village.

25:51.671 --> 25:53.973
I passed Schlitz Malt Liquor.
I say again.

25:54.404 --> 25:56.073
I passed Schlitz Malt Liquor.

25:56.771 --> 25:57.805
Good copy.

25:58.005 --> 26:00.172
Sir, intermittent comms
with Spartan O-1,

26:00.238 --> 26:01.558
but they have
arrived at the O.P.

26:04.504 --> 26:05.504
All right, fellas.

26:06.238 --> 26:08.708
Our boys are safe and
secure for the day.

26:08.772 --> 26:11.107
Team one, back to
Ba-gram with me.

26:11.838 --> 26:16.009
Team two, enjoy your time
here at J-Bad. Nighty-night.

26:19.505 --> 26:21.607
Spartan O-1, Apollo 2-2.

26:22.505 --> 26:24.406
Sun's up. We're out.
Good luck.

26:24.472 --> 26:25.539
A- firm.

26:33.606 --> 26:35.107
Find a new spot?

26:36.773 --> 26:37.940
Let's try to make that peak.

26:39.006 --> 26:40.841
See if that's not better.

26:41.506 --> 26:42.841
Sounds good.

26:58.607 --> 27:00.175
Boys all set?

27:00.507 --> 27:03.843
They're all set. They're
in position. All's good.

27:04.507 --> 27:06.609
Enjoy your night. Sleep well.

27:06.674 --> 27:07.809
Enjoy yours, brother.

27:07.875 --> 27:08.875
Thanks, Pete.

27:10.841 --> 27:12.843
Glorious day. Eh, Patton?

27:13.107 --> 27:14.374
Yes, sir.

27:17.675 --> 27:19.043
We good?

27:19.107 --> 27:20.707
Yeah. They arrived
about 30 minutes ago.

27:20.708 --> 27:22.876
Should be digging in nice
and tight right about now.

27:44.176 --> 27:48.680
- Zulu 06, Bruno 64 is wheels
up. J. - Bad, enrooted Ba-gram.

28:22.177 --> 28:23.846
Marcus, on me.

28:24.511 --> 28:28.181
Danny, take our six. Inform
command of our new position.

28:29.578 --> 28:31.914
Axe. Eyes on.

29:00.145 --> 29:02.147
Goddamn. Shit.

29:07.846 --> 29:10.149
That's a lot more
than 10 guys.

29:10.846 --> 29:12.515
That's a fucking army.

29:26.180 --> 29:28.181
Four guys on the right.

29:30.347 --> 29:32.015
Red scarf.

29:33.013 --> 29:35.216
No earlobes.

29:42.682 --> 29:43.749
Ooh!

29:44.514 --> 29:47.183
Super freak. That's
Rick James, bitch.

29:49.014 --> 29:50.449
You make that shot?

29:51.181 --> 29:54.218
Negative. Wouldn't
have authority anyway.

29:58.515 --> 30:01.184
Dietz, we got Shah P-I.D# d.
Call in Rick James.

30:01.249 --> 30:02.249
Fuck, yeah.

30:02.582 --> 30:04.050
Axe, you sexy in there?
You comfy?

30:04.115 --> 30:05.717
Solid. Advise on target.

30:06.348 --> 30:07.851
Danny, you make comms yet?

30:07.915 --> 30:09.316
No joy.

30:09.683 --> 30:10.784
Fuck.

30:12.849 --> 30:13.916
We're too exposed.

30:15.015 --> 30:17.351
What do you think?
Keep Axe at O.P. 1?

30:17.683 --> 30:21.019
Move back twenty-five
yards, set up O.P. 2?

30:23.016 --> 30:24.183
Roger that.

30:26.450 --> 30:27.918
Axe, you're on surveillance.

30:27.983 --> 30:30.222
Dietz, fall back to O.P. 2 and
get me some fucking comms.

31:31.053 --> 31:34.055
Spartan Base, this
is Spartan O-1.

31:34.386 --> 31:35.755
Radio check. How copy?

31:35.819 --> 31:37.153
Hey, L.T.

31:37.219 --> 31:38.320
Yeah.

31:38.386 --> 31:39.918
If we're home by the
15th, me and Morgan

31:39.919 --> 31:41.917
are gonna cut down all the
trees around the stable.

31:43.220 --> 31:44.321
How is that gonna help me?

31:44.620 --> 31:45.620
Hello?

31:46.554 --> 31:48.722
Brahms horse auction
is, I think, the 27th.

31:49.054 --> 31:51.189
That means if I cut down the
trees behind the stable,

31:51.254 --> 31:52.493
I get a discount
for your horse.

31:52.820 --> 31:54.154
Do they sell Arabic horses?

31:54.320 --> 31:57.691
First of all, it's not an Arabic
horse, okay? It's an Arabian horse.

31:57.755 --> 31:58.755
Arabic.

31:59.187 --> 32:00.955
It's... You're from
New York, okay?

32:01.887 --> 32:03.855
How much is an Arabic horse?
It's Arabian horse.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.921
How much is an Arabian horse?

32:07.054 --> 32:08.356
No less than 15 grand.

32:08.820 --> 32:10.022
Fifteen fucking grand?

32:10.388 --> 32:11.788
Hell of a wedding present.

32:20.888 --> 32:23.156
Is that redhead a bridesmaid?
Radio check. How copy?

32:23.221 --> 32:24.756
Melissa? The redhead, dude.

32:24.821 --> 32:25.888
The one with freckles
on her nose.

32:25.955 --> 32:27.022
The cute one from the
Cold play concert.

32:27.088 --> 32:28.423
That's Melissa.

32:28.489 --> 32:29.889
Is she coming? She's
a bridesmaid.

32:29.955 --> 32:31.790
Yeah. Is she coming?

32:34.222 --> 32:36.724
She's a bridesmaid. Yes.

32:36.922 --> 32:38.556
Did she ask about me? No.

32:43.322 --> 32:45.692
Mikey, I'm good here. I'm
going to break down O.P.1.

32:46.155 --> 32:47.190
Copy that.

32:53.223 --> 32:57.393
Listen up. At 0930, we move to
high ground and make comms.

32:58.723 --> 33:01.826
Marcus, Axe, shut her down.
Dietz, you got security.

33:04.390 --> 33:06.058
Rest up, gents.

33:11.890 --> 33:13.825
Can you get off the radio
while you're chewing?

33:15.558 --> 33:17.593
You're making me nauseous.

34:33.793 --> 34:35.396
Mikey, you see this?

34:41.495 --> 34:43.163
What the fuck is this?

34:53.563 --> 34:54.829
Oh, shit.

35:42.398 --> 35:43.398
Get down!

35:43.465 --> 35:44.566
Down!

35:52.564 --> 35:55.234
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

35:56.131 --> 35:57.332
Get up.

35:57.398 --> 35:58.899
Get your hands back.

35:58.965 --> 36:00.633
Spartan Base, Spartan O-1.

36:00.698 --> 36:02.032
Stepped right the fuck on me.

36:04.231 --> 36:09.203
What the fuck is this? What the
fuck? Are you talking to Taliban?

36:11.332 --> 36:12.466
Fucking Tali.

36:13.899 --> 36:16.935
Saying again. This is
Spartan O-1. Over.

36:17.399 --> 36:18.500
Come on. Come on.

36:19.565 --> 36:21.601
Hey, eyes down. Eyes down.

36:22.066 --> 36:23.867
Eyes down. Eyes down.

36:23.932 --> 36:24.999
Motherfuck.

36:25.066 --> 36:27.935
Axe. Eyes on him,
what he does.

36:41.566 --> 36:42.734
Fuck.

36:43.266 --> 36:46.336
Spartan Base, this is
Spartan O-1. Over.

36:50.733 --> 36:52.135
Danny, your radio working?

36:54.900 --> 36:56.202
So now I'm going
to be that guy

36:56.800 --> 36:59.702
calling on an unsecured sat line
because your shit ain't functioning.

36:59.766 --> 37:00.805
Talk to the Mountain, sir.

37:01.234 --> 37:03.035
Eyes down. Eyes down.

37:05.734 --> 37:07.235
Motherfuck.

37:14.001 --> 37:15.669
You know, it's feeling
like a cursed op.

37:16.069 --> 37:18.637
It's not a cursed op.
There's no curses.

37:18.701 --> 37:20.270
It's just Afghanistan.
That's all.

37:27.902 --> 37:29.503
J- Bad TOC, Sergeant
Hasslert speaking.

37:29.569 --> 37:32.505
Sergeant, this is Spartan O-1.
Do you hear me?

37:33.902 --> 37:35.069
Hello.

37:35.403 --> 37:36.836
Sergeant, this is Spartan O-1.

37:37.668 --> 37:39.038
Yes, yes, I can hear you, sir.

37:39.103 --> 37:41.171
I am calling on an
unsecured line.

37:41.236 --> 37:42.835
I need to speak to the C.O.
immediately.

37:42.836 --> 37:44.737
The C.O.? That's correct.

37:44.803 --> 37:45.937
Which C.O., sir?

37:46.003 --> 37:47.170
Commander Kristensen.

37:48.169 --> 37:49.704
Commander Kristensen
isn't here, sir.

37:50.136 --> 37:51.237
Ah, he's at Ba-gram.

37:51.570 --> 37:52.737
Yes, that's correct, sir.

37:53.169 --> 37:55.539
I need you to transfer me
to Ba-gram Ouellette TOC.

37:55.870 --> 37:57.004
Now.

37:57.070 --> 37:58.238
Roger that, sir. Stand by.

38:07.570 --> 38:08.809
Ouellette. Petty
Officer Patton.

38:09.170 --> 38:10.939
Patton, Mike Murphy.

38:11.170 --> 38:12.572
You're looking
for Mike Murphy?

38:12.637 --> 38:14.472
This is Mike Murphy.
Do you copy?

38:14.637 --> 38:15.771
Mike?

38:17.037 --> 38:19.005
This connection sucks.
What's up, man?

38:19.372 --> 38:21.373
Patton, get me
the Skipper now.

38:21.971 --> 38:23.139
He's sleeping, sir.

38:23.205 --> 38:24.538
Wake him the fuck up.

38:26.504 --> 38:27.873
Did you say wake him up, sir?

38:28.338 --> 38:29.939
Right fucking now.

38:30.005 --> 38:31.373
Roger that.

38:33.238 --> 38:34.639
Murph wants me to
wake the Skipper.

38:35.505 --> 38:37.073
Mike Murphy? Yeah.

38:37.138 --> 38:39.073
That's Mike Murphy?
Well, go get him.

38:51.671 --> 38:53.007
Commander Kristensen?

38:54.405 --> 38:55.740
Commander Kristensen?

38:59.239 --> 39:00.840
Sir, sorry, sir.

39:00.906 --> 39:02.574
I got Lieutenant Murphy on the
phone for you in the TOC.

39:02.639 --> 39:04.038
He says he needs to
talk to you now.

39:16.406 --> 39:17.541
Which one?

39:17.607 --> 39:18.708
Right there.

39:20.874 --> 39:22.909
Mike? Mike?

39:24.274 --> 39:25.441
Oh, it dropped.

39:26.074 --> 39:27.176
Mike?

39:27.874 --> 39:29.909
It's dead. What did he say?

39:30.574 --> 39:32.093
Uh, just that he
needed to talk to you.

39:33.740 --> 39:35.408
Why is Murphy calling
on a sat phone?

39:35.474 --> 39:37.043
No idea.

39:37.674 --> 39:40.177
Are we having comms
problems with Spartan O-1?

39:40.241 --> 39:43.243
We were good for a while, but we've
missed two windows now, sir.

39:43.674 --> 39:44.842
Two.

39:45.575 --> 39:47.777
Try him back! For fuck's sake.

40:07.742 --> 40:10.245
Fuck! Worst fucking comms.

40:10.576 --> 40:11.977
Well, we could light
the goats on fire,

40:12.043 --> 40:13.043
smoke signal our
way out of here.

40:13.243 --> 40:15.577
Yeah, I could walk down to the
village, ask to borrow a phone.

40:15.642 --> 40:18.045
You'd get some interesting
tile ideas down there, bro.

40:18.110 --> 40:19.945
Afghan Dirt Brown,
Goat Skin Blond.

40:20.010 --> 40:21.343
Shit, she'll dig that a
hell of a lot more than,

40:21.409 --> 40:22.677
what is it, fucking
Honey Cream?

40:28.910 --> 40:31.279
Sit down. Sit down!

40:44.677 --> 40:46.278
Way I see it, we
got three options.

40:48.078 --> 40:50.980
One, we let them go, hike up.

40:52.078 --> 40:54.114
We'll probably be found
in less than an hour.

40:54.744 --> 40:58.014
Two, we tie them up,
hike out, roll the dice.

40:58.744 --> 41:02.547
They'll probably be eaten by fucking
wolves, or freeze to death.

41:07.145 --> 41:08.212
Three?

41:08.277 --> 41:09.780
We terminate the compromise.

41:27.146 --> 41:30.716
Shah's down there. We let them go,
we're letting him go. Mission fails.

41:39.513 --> 41:40.847
No, Mikey.

41:41.580 --> 41:44.649
I don't like it. I don't
fucking like it at all.

41:44.914 --> 41:47.415
What are we gonna do? We
gonna kill them? Huh?

41:47.480 --> 41:50.516
Okay, we kill them, right? What,
then what? Fucking bury 'em?

41:51.014 --> 41:52.148
They get found, then what?

41:52.380 --> 41:53.548
Then what?

41:53.947 --> 41:55.148
What do you mean, then what?

41:55.213 --> 41:56.815
And then what?

41:57.280 --> 41:58.682
You know then what.

41:59.581 --> 42:01.049
What do you think? This
shit's gonna be private?

42:01.115 --> 42:03.353
Huh? It's gonna be out there
for the whole fucking world.

42:03.581 --> 42:06.184
CNN, okay? "Seals kill kids."

42:06.247 --> 42:07.581
That's the fucking
story forever.

42:07.647 --> 42:09.605
It's nobody's fucking
business what we do up here.

42:11.414 --> 42:14.751
We do what we do.
What we have to do.

42:15.347 --> 42:17.483
This is the fucking Navy and
you're the fucking boss,

42:17.548 --> 42:19.816
so you make the
fucking call, sir.

42:25.582 --> 42:28.118
Shah killed 20
Marines last week.

42:29.116 --> 42:30.316
Twenty.

42:32.016 --> 42:35.519
We let him go, 20 more
will die next week.

42:35.583 --> 42:38.919
Forty more the week after that.
Our job is to stop Shah.

42:40.983 --> 42:43.919
Why do these men have the right
to dictate how we do our job?

42:44.549 --> 42:46.717
Rules of Engagement says
we cannot touch them.

42:47.416 --> 42:48.885
I understand.

42:49.583 --> 42:51.217
And I don't care.

42:53.117 --> 42:56.064
I care about you.
I care about you.

42:56.385 --> 42:58.084
I care about you.
I care about you.

42:58.282 --> 43:01.020
I don't want your mom
seeing your head,

43:01.584 --> 43:04.219
your decapitated
head on Al Jazeera.

43:05.584 --> 43:06.718
That is Shah.

43:07.250 --> 43:08.884
I don't see it that way.

43:09.584 --> 43:13.021
Where do you think he's running
to? 200 friends down there.

43:13.085 --> 43:16.320
Got guys in Leavenworth doing
20 for taking home trophy guns.

43:16.384 --> 43:17.451
What do you think
they're gonna do

43:17.517 --> 43:20.087
for two fucking kids and
an old fucking man?

43:20.684 --> 43:21.986
Fucking look at them, man.

43:24.250 --> 43:25.552
They fucking hate us.

43:25.918 --> 43:30.856
Look, at him. That's not a kid, that's a
soldier. That's death. Look at death.

43:31.284 --> 43:32.653
We can't do it. Look
at that soldier.

43:32.718 --> 43:34.653
They are unarmed prisoners.

43:34.919 --> 43:38.922
And the second they run down there,
we got 200 hajis on our backs.

43:38.986 --> 43:40.219
Tie 'em up.

43:40.284 --> 43:41.452
Tie 'em up. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

43:41.519 --> 43:43.587
We can't just fucking
leave 'em, let 'em go!

43:43.652 --> 43:45.520
I thought you were standing by
waiting for your fucking orders?

43:45.586 --> 43:47.454
I am standing by waiting
for my fucking orders.

43:47.519 --> 43:48.887
What do you think
that radio's for?

43:48.952 --> 43:50.453
They're not calling
Domino's Pizza.

43:50.519 --> 43:51.753
I know what the
fucking radio's for.

43:51.819 --> 43:53.120
That radio's fucking Tali.

43:53.185 --> 43:54.520
It's a cell phone
to the Taliban.

43:54.685 --> 43:57.422
So you just think it'll just
be our little secret? Huh?

44:00.419 --> 44:01.921
That's a warrior.

44:02.152 --> 44:03.219
Schwack them.

44:04.920 --> 44:06.788
We cannot do that.

44:06.853 --> 44:08.921
This is a soft compromise.

44:08.987 --> 44:10.185
You want to go to Leavenworth?

44:10.186 --> 44:12.289
You don't know how many hajis
they have down there, man.

44:12.353 --> 44:13.554
Don't let him influence you.

44:13.620 --> 44:14.854
Marcus, I'm just saying,
you can't just say...

44:14.920 --> 44:16.154
Look at that child.

44:16.220 --> 44:18.022
Make up your fucking mind and
don't let him influence you.

44:18.087 --> 44:19.121
Schwack them.

44:19.186 --> 44:20.956
Mikey, it's your fucking call.
I ain't fucking voting.

44:21.021 --> 44:22.756
This is not a vote.

44:24.087 --> 44:27.891
This is what we're gonna do.
This op is compromised.

44:31.254 --> 44:33.789
So we're going to
pack up everything.

44:34.087 --> 44:37.124
We're gonna cut them loose and
we're gonna make this peak.

44:37.187 --> 44:40.190
When we make this peak,
you're gonna get comms up.

44:40.421 --> 44:44.926
When we get these comms up, we're gonna
call for extract and we're going home.

44:46.254 --> 44:47.355
Roger that, sir.

44:47.421 --> 44:49.122
Roger that. Roger.

44:49.187 --> 44:51.123
Spartan O-1. Spartan
O-1, do you copy?

44:51.187 --> 44:52.857
Fisher? Coffee.

44:53.755 --> 44:56.491
Spartan O-1, radio
check, do you copy?

45:00.422 --> 45:04.860
Radio check for Spartan O-1.
Radio check. Spartan O-1.

45:09.255 --> 45:12.592
Spartan O-1... Spartan
O-1, do you copy?

45:18.256 --> 45:19.690
Where are you guys going?

45:20.123 --> 45:21.524
Just got called north!

45:21.590 --> 45:22.757
We're QRF!

45:22.823 --> 45:24.157
We have troops in contact!

45:24.223 --> 45:25.758
But we're fucking QRF!

45:25.824 --> 45:28.158
We're going! We have TIC!

45:36.023 --> 45:37.625
What the fuck is
with the Apaches?

45:37.690 --> 45:38.892
Troops in contact.

45:38.957 --> 45:42.660
Limited resources, Chief.
There ain't enough Apaches.

45:44.257 --> 45:45.558
That's fucked up.

45:45.858 --> 45:47.258
They'll be back.

46:02.625 --> 46:03.892
Hey. Hey.

46:04.925 --> 46:06.693
You just won the lottery.

47:48.763 --> 47:52.065
Any station, listen up.
Please relay to Spartan O-1.

47:53.796 --> 47:55.932
Spartan to base, do you copy?

47:57.030 --> 48:00.833
Spartan O-1, Spartan O-1
to base, do you copy?

48:25.531 --> 48:26.633
Fuck.

48:47.099 --> 48:48.768
Oh, fuck!

48:53.766 --> 48:55.234
False summit.

49:05.266 --> 49:06.600
Fuck! Yeah.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.134
Danny, get me some comms.

49:09.601 --> 49:12.537
Come on. Spartan Base,
this is Spartan O-1. Over.

49:12.766 --> 49:14.468
What do you want to do?

49:14.534 --> 49:17.202
Go home. Get in bed,
watch Anchorman.

49:17.434 --> 49:18.832
Yeah, Roger that.
What do you think?

49:19.267 --> 49:21.034
I think we did
the right thing.

49:21.101 --> 49:22.500
I think we let our
love light shine.

49:22.766 --> 49:24.101
Fuck me!

49:24.601 --> 49:26.469
I mean, isn't that
how things work?

49:26.534 --> 49:28.068
Good things happen
to good people?

49:28.534 --> 49:29.702
This is a bad spot.

49:30.701 --> 49:32.803
Danny, I got nothing here
on sat. Give me something.

49:32.867 --> 49:33.906
I don't have fucking shit.

49:35.101 --> 49:36.202
How do you feel?

49:36.267 --> 49:38.002
This is a bad spot.

49:38.934 --> 49:40.269
You okay?

49:40.502 --> 49:41.603
All set.

49:41.934 --> 49:45.737
Good. Let's fall back to that
tree line. Wait till sundown.

49:45.800 --> 49:47.736
If we can't make comms, we're
walking home anyways, gents.

49:47.800 --> 49:49.203
Let's get some rest.

49:49.268 --> 49:51.036
Pack up, let's move.

49:51.502 --> 49:53.170
Fuck.

50:03.269 --> 50:05.604
Spartan O-1, Spartan
to base, do you copy?

50:06.436 --> 50:09.105
Spartan O-1, radio
check, do you copy?

50:09.436 --> 50:11.703
Sir, they've now
missed three windows.

50:14.603 --> 50:15.870
Okay.

50:23.237 --> 50:25.838
Commander Shriver, there's
a call for you on line 17.

50:25.903 --> 50:27.071
Roger.

50:32.337 --> 50:33.504
Commander Shriver.

50:33.803 --> 50:34.871
Uh, sir, this is Erik.

50:34.937 --> 50:39.041
For your S.A., we have missed three
comm windows with Spartan O-1.

50:39.538 --> 50:42.172
Last known comms were at 0700.

50:42.237 --> 50:43.836
Why am I hearing this
from you right now?

50:44.104 --> 50:46.640
Sir, we expected to have
some comms problems.

50:47.037 --> 50:49.873
Murphy and I discussed and agreed
that we would not start a spin

50:49.937 --> 50:51.472
until after he
missed two windows.

50:51.938 --> 50:53.738
Is there a fucking
problem here, Erik?

50:54.605 --> 50:56.440
Sir, I've told you everything
I have at this point.

50:56.505 --> 50:58.373
I will call you when I
have more information.

50:58.438 --> 51:00.273
This is Commander
Kristensen out.

51:02.338 --> 51:03.440
Fuck.

52:32.775 --> 52:36.346
I'm going to do some Recon.
Be back in two minutes.

52:36.775 --> 52:39.078
You want some company?
Negative.

52:43.209 --> 52:46.780
I'm going to do about two minutes
of Recon. Be right back.

53:50.113 --> 53:52.547
We're about to get contacted.

54:00.946 --> 54:02.814
How fucking fast
are these guys?

54:02.879 --> 54:03.980
Fast.

54:04.812 --> 54:05.914
What are you thinking?

54:07.280 --> 54:10.277
I'm thinking we're about getting fixing
to get into a pretty good gun fight.

54:10.546 --> 54:11.580
Copy that.

54:12.712 --> 54:14.382
Looks like I voted wrong.

54:15.280 --> 54:16.546
Negative.

54:17.047 --> 54:18.248
We just got the opportunity

54:18.313 --> 54:21.283
to make hell fucking strong contact
with our friend from the other side.

54:21.347 --> 54:22.481
Job well done.

54:23.247 --> 54:24.715
Hoo-yah to that, sir.

54:27.080 --> 54:29.449
Danny, get ready to fight.

54:38.848 --> 54:40.182
Hey, Mikey...

54:42.314 --> 54:44.216
I'm about ready to
punch that time card.

54:44.581 --> 54:45.581
Do it.

55:35.983 --> 55:38.485
Push left! Marcus, move!

56:08.384 --> 56:09.384
Moving!

56:41.653 --> 56:43.321
Motherfucker.

57:02.421 --> 57:04.456
Spartan Base, this
is Spartan O-1.

57:05.454 --> 57:07.857
Request immediate QRF!
Troops in contact!

57:10.055 --> 57:12.456
Fuck! Fuck.

57:17.955 --> 57:20.457
Fucking shit! Motherfuck!

57:21.321 --> 57:22.456
Motherfucker!

57:32.189 --> 57:33.189
Allahu Akbar!

57:36.722 --> 57:38.558
Contact, twelve o'clock!

58:00.289 --> 58:01.356
Axe?

58:02.024 --> 58:03.058
Yeah.

58:09.323 --> 58:11.492
Mikey. Left is good.

58:11.690 --> 58:13.258
I say again, left is good.

58:21.491 --> 58:22.658
Mikey!

58:22.991 --> 58:26.361
Left is not good! I say
again, left is not good!

58:26.425 --> 58:27.526
Roger that! Push right!

58:45.291 --> 58:46.926
We are good right.

58:47.325 --> 58:49.161
Push right. Push right.

58:49.225 --> 58:50.226
Push right.

58:53.692 --> 58:54.960
Murph, down!

58:58.893 --> 59:00.426
Goddamn motherfuckers!

59:01.292 --> 59:03.128
Fuck you!

59:05.893 --> 59:07.326
Smoke out!

59:07.760 --> 59:09.928
Hey! Consolidate on Mikey!

59:21.460 --> 59:23.129
Shit! Fuck!

59:25.794 --> 59:27.929
Right is no good!
Right is no good!

59:28.894 --> 59:29.961
Move!

59:37.129 --> 59:39.463
Back! Back!

59:41.227 --> 59:42.295
First man!

59:43.261 --> 59:45.831
Mikey! Consolidate on me!

59:55.595 --> 59:56.729
Fuck.

01:00:07.129 --> 01:00:09.431
I think we can take 'em, Mikey,
but we're gonna need a new spot!

01:00:09.529 --> 01:00:11.765
Roger that! Danny, comms!

01:00:11.896 --> 01:00:14.898
Negative! Radio's down
hard, it took some rounds!

01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:17.298
You got crypto? Yeah!

01:00:17.563 --> 01:00:19.197
Gas the fucking
radio, we're moving!

01:00:19.363 --> 01:00:20.430
Roger that!

01:00:22.296 --> 01:00:23.363
Shit!

01:00:27.064 --> 01:00:28.431
Ow, fuck!

01:00:29.631 --> 01:00:31.198
Ow! Fuck!

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:35.398
Marcus, on me!

01:00:37.297 --> 01:00:38.631
Fuck!

01:00:40.464 --> 01:00:41.798
We're falling back!

01:00:41.931 --> 01:00:43.033
You mean fall off?

01:00:43.097 --> 01:00:44.431
Yeah! Fuck!

01:00:44.497 --> 01:00:45.764
Axe!

01:00:46.297 --> 01:00:47.966
Axe, on me!

01:00:48.197 --> 01:00:50.465
Ready? Move it!

01:00:53.464 --> 01:00:54.966
Ready? Roger!

01:00:55.032 --> 01:00:56.533
Go, go, go!

01:01:04.432 --> 01:01:05.499
Jesus.

01:01:06.665 --> 01:01:07.732
Shit.

01:01:10.198 --> 01:01:12.199
Oh, my God.

01:01:16.966 --> 01:01:18.066
Fuck.

01:01:58.233 --> 01:01:59.569
I lost my rifle.

01:02:00.768 --> 01:02:03.269
My rifle. My...

01:02:06.834 --> 01:02:07.969
Shit.

01:02:20.401 --> 01:02:22.402
You see? God's
looking out for us.

01:02:22.468 --> 01:02:26.205
If that's God looking out for
us, I'd hate to see him pissed.

01:02:26.569 --> 01:02:29.238
Oh, God... thank
you, thank you!

01:02:32.335 --> 01:02:33.770
Where's Axe?

01:02:35.469 --> 01:02:37.204
That sucked.

01:02:38.702 --> 01:02:40.503
They fuck... They
fucking shot me.

01:02:40.569 --> 01:02:41.771
Living in the past, Danny.

01:02:41.836 --> 01:02:43.195
We're all shot, bro.
Can you fight?

01:02:43.269 --> 01:02:46.171
Messed up my drawing hand,
that pisses me off.

01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:50.171
All right, we're good.

01:02:50.503 --> 01:02:51.670
We just gotta get
to flat ground,

01:02:51.736 --> 01:02:53.971
then we take these
motherfuckers, that's it.

01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:02.471
Fucking foot!

01:03:02.637 --> 01:03:04.639
Goddamn, this sucks! Oh, fuck.

01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:09.405
Fuck you.

01:03:10.804 --> 01:03:11.905
Fuck!

01:03:15.904 --> 01:03:18.106
Damn! Fucking burns!

01:03:18.371 --> 01:03:20.005
Danny. I can fight.

01:03:21.271 --> 01:03:22.906
Way to go, buddy.

01:03:26.371 --> 01:03:28.772
Peel left! Peel left!

01:03:29.004 --> 01:03:30.539
Last man!

01:03:31.104 --> 01:03:33.239
Let me see it. You okay?
Give me your arm. Yeah.

01:03:35.004 --> 01:03:36.406
Whoa. Passing to the left!

01:03:46.172 --> 01:03:47.239
Come on down!

01:04:20.674 --> 01:04:21.741
Danny!

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.208
Let's go.

01:04:23.641 --> 01:04:25.542
Get them up! Come on.

01:04:34.741 --> 01:04:35.742
Come on.

01:04:36.642 --> 01:04:37.642
Come on.

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:38.874
Over...

01:04:42.575 --> 01:04:43.709
Come on.

01:04:44.041 --> 01:04:45.209
Come on!

01:04:45.608 --> 01:04:48.677
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:04:51.942 --> 01:04:53.678
Come on. Find a fucking strap.

01:04:53.742 --> 01:04:55.210
Get him up. Get him up.

01:04:57.341 --> 01:04:59.010
Come on. Fuck.

01:05:00.342 --> 01:05:02.077
Get him. Get him up.

01:05:15.876 --> 01:05:17.877
Fuck. Fuck.

01:05:28.444 --> 01:05:30.679
I got two mags, one frag.

01:05:32.377 --> 01:05:33.878
Hey.

01:05:38.777 --> 01:05:40.111
Oh, man.

01:05:40.277 --> 01:05:41.479
Hey.

01:05:41.611 --> 01:05:42.911
Oh.

01:05:43.010 --> 01:05:44.612
This is bad here.

01:05:44.711 --> 01:05:45.911
Mm.

01:05:45.977 --> 01:05:47.078
This is a fucking problem.

01:05:48.877 --> 01:05:50.546
Fucking no comms.

01:05:50.944 --> 01:05:52.346
Fucking comms.

01:05:52.810 --> 01:05:54.689
You're okay, right? Shot
me up pretty good, bro.

01:05:57.045 --> 01:05:58.880
This hand, let me see.

01:06:00.978 --> 01:06:04.449
You're all right. Look at me.
Hey, look at me.

01:06:04.911 --> 01:06:06.779
You okay? Huh?

01:06:06.844 --> 01:06:09.348
Suck it the fuck up, okay,
Danny? You're a fucking frogman.

01:06:10.045 --> 01:06:12.281
Fuck, I lost my med kit.

01:06:12.345 --> 01:06:14.715
You got a little hit in the
leg, okay? Look it here.

01:06:15.046 --> 01:06:16.347
You okay?

01:06:17.646 --> 01:06:19.247
Hold on. Okay.

01:06:19.612 --> 01:06:21.013
There.

01:06:21.079 --> 01:06:25.416
Okay? Okay. Okay. Lay back.
Lay back.

01:06:26.046 --> 01:06:28.882
Let me see, Mikey. Come here.
Let me see it.

01:06:30.112 --> 01:06:31.380
Fuck.

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:36.281
You pack it with some fucking
dirt, tight, you hear me?

01:06:36.447 --> 01:06:38.781
Keep it packed
tight, all right?

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:41.582
I fucking love Afghanistan.

01:06:42.113 --> 01:06:43.682
Come here, buddy. Hold up.
Yeah, we're all set.

01:06:43.746 --> 01:06:45.583
Let me see. Let me see you.

01:06:45.648 --> 01:06:46.781
Get your head down.
Let me see.

01:06:46.846 --> 01:06:47.881
All right, heads down.
Get your head down.

01:06:47.947 --> 01:06:50.249
Let me see you. Come here.
Keep your head down.

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.215
Let me see you. I'm good.

01:06:53.281 --> 01:06:55.882
Yeah, I know you're good.
I know you're good. Easy.

01:06:56.214 --> 01:06:58.282
Mikey, how'd they get us
so fast? Shut the fuck up!

01:07:01.148 --> 01:07:02.816
Do you fucking see them?

01:07:02.881 --> 01:07:04.082
Bro...

01:07:04.781 --> 01:07:08.384
I just don't understand how
fucking fast they were, man.

01:07:08.649 --> 01:07:10.517
Oh, fuck. I just...

01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:12.616
Fucking faster than we are?

01:07:13.181 --> 01:07:14.349
They're not faster than us.

01:07:14.847 --> 01:07:16.983
I was fucking
talking to my mom.

01:07:17.048 --> 01:07:19.683
She didn't fucking
say nothing about...

01:07:19.747 --> 01:07:22.065
She didn't fucking say nothing!
Danny, suck it the fuck up.

01:07:29.583 --> 01:07:32.519
Oh, fuck, such vivid reds. Oh!

01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:34.083
We got to move, Mikey.

01:07:45.983 --> 01:07:47.884
Fuck. Mikey, what do you want?

01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:49.117
Axe, smoke!

01:07:49.383 --> 01:07:50.417
Smoke up!

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:51.585
Smoke 'em!

01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:53.351
Oh, they're coming!

01:07:54.883 --> 01:07:57.085
Get the fuck up and get
your fucking legs working,

01:07:57.183 --> 01:07:58.318
you hear me? Yeah.

01:07:58.384 --> 01:07:59.717
Come on, let's go!

01:08:05.849 --> 01:08:06.885
Let's go!

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:09.785
You got Danny? I got him.

01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:11.686
Axe, we're moving down!
Move where?

01:08:12.284 --> 01:08:13.451
Down!

01:08:14.684 --> 01:08:15.718
Good to go.

01:08:27.952 --> 01:08:29.453
Danny! Danny!

01:09:35.287 --> 01:09:37.622
RPG. RPG.

01:09:41.854 --> 01:09:42.921
Fuck!

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:55.189
You good Danny?

01:09:57.855 --> 01:09:59.654
Where's Danny? Where's Danny?
I don't see him.

01:10:01.422 --> 01:10:03.190
Is he hit? Is he hit?

01:10:03.256 --> 01:10:04.323
Is he hit?

01:10:05.022 --> 01:10:07.023
Where is he? Where's Danny?
I don't see him.

01:10:07.156 --> 01:10:08.156
Where is he?

01:10:08.555 --> 01:10:10.057
He's up top. What?

01:10:10.122 --> 01:10:11.690
He's up top. He got... Where?

01:10:11.756 --> 01:10:13.023
He got hit in the head.
Up top where?

01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:14.357
Fuck.

01:10:14.522 --> 01:10:16.091
We gotta go get him.
Up top where?

01:10:16.157 --> 01:10:17.316
We got to go get him. Up top.

01:10:17.457 --> 01:10:19.058
Where's Danny? Did he get hit?

01:10:19.123 --> 01:10:20.157
We got to go get him.
We gotta get him.

01:10:20.257 --> 01:10:21.358
We got to get up
there and get him.

01:10:21.423 --> 01:10:23.258
We can take 'em on flat ground.
We gotta get up top.

01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:24.924
We get up there, we get
him, get him down the hill,

01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:26.424
and then we can take 'em on flat
ground. We take 'em on flat ground.

01:10:26.623 --> 01:10:28.057
Fuck!

01:10:31.458 --> 01:10:33.792
Come on! Axe, get up here now!

01:10:34.224 --> 01:10:35.224
Get him up here.

01:10:35.291 --> 01:10:37.126
Come on, Axe, you
gotta get down!

01:10:58.358 --> 01:10:59.759
Oh, fuck!

01:11:00.392 --> 01:11:02.360
We're gonna go
get Danny up top

01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:04.526
and then we're gonna come back
down and fight on flat ground,

01:11:04.624 --> 01:11:06.393
we're gonna kill 'em all.

01:11:06.458 --> 01:11:07.559
Marcus, you good?

01:11:08.725 --> 01:11:09.826
I'm good!

01:11:09.925 --> 01:11:11.760
Axe, you're security,
and let's go.

01:11:11.825 --> 01:11:13.126
Roger.

01:11:13.192 --> 01:11:14.293
Let's move.

01:11:19.058 --> 01:11:20.394
Moving!

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:28.294
Let's move!

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:39.229
You can die for your country.
I'm going to live for mine.

01:11:40.327 --> 01:11:41.427
Fuck.

01:11:42.859 --> 01:11:43.962
Fuck!

01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:49.862
Marcus, move!

01:11:50.626 --> 01:11:51.961
Moving!

01:12:04.061 --> 01:12:05.629
I don't think we can
get up from here.

01:12:05.694 --> 01:12:07.333
We ain't out-fucking
flanking 'em, Mikey.

01:12:08.128 --> 01:12:09.661
We got to find another way.

01:12:27.996 --> 01:12:29.330
M-4.

01:12:31.296 --> 01:12:33.630
I'm going to make
the call to QRF.

01:12:33.896 --> 01:12:36.397
You ain't making no fucking comms
with that sat phone, Mikey.

01:12:36.729 --> 01:12:38.063
Look at me.

01:12:39.296 --> 01:12:41.398
I'm going to make the call.

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:48.464
No. No, Mikey.

01:12:50.063 --> 01:12:51.631
No. Fuck that.

01:12:59.164 --> 01:13:02.133
No. No. Fuck that, Mikey.

01:13:02.863 --> 01:13:04.465
Take it. You fucking take it.

01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:07.697
Mikey, give me the fucking...

01:13:23.831 --> 01:13:24.831
I'm sorry, Mike.

01:13:25.631 --> 01:13:26.898
For what?

01:13:29.465 --> 01:13:31.224
That we haven't killed
more of these fuckers.

01:13:31.698 --> 01:13:35.235
Oh, don't be fucking sorry. We're
gonna fucking kill way more of 'em.

01:13:36.865 --> 01:13:37.866
Fuck!

01:13:43.298 --> 01:13:44.466
Marcus.

01:13:47.232 --> 01:13:48.967
Never out of the fight.

01:14:00.299 --> 01:14:01.801
What's he doing, Marcus?

01:14:02.632 --> 01:14:05.102
Murphy's moving!
Murphy's moving!

01:14:10.833 --> 01:14:12.501
Where is he going?

01:14:23.968 --> 01:14:25.636
Oh, fuck!

01:14:30.867 --> 01:14:32.135
Murphy's moving!

01:14:42.868 --> 01:14:43.936
Oh, fuck.

01:14:53.234 --> 01:14:54.836
I am the Reaper.

01:15:06.469 --> 01:15:07.503
Fuck.

01:15:18.170 --> 01:15:19.271
Fucking A.

01:15:22.336 --> 01:15:23.503
Fuck!

01:16:08.973 --> 01:16:10.908
J- Bad TOC. Sergeant Hasslert.

01:16:11.039 --> 01:16:14.976
This is Lieutenant Mike Murphy.
Spartan O-1.

01:16:15.472 --> 01:16:17.240
We need immediate air support.

01:16:21.339 --> 01:16:22.473
We need help.

01:16:22.572 --> 01:16:27.144
We are heading down the ravine
towards the Chichal Village.

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.040
Roger that, Murphy.

01:16:29.273 --> 01:16:31.708
We need immediate CAS.

01:16:31.806 --> 01:16:34.042
Lieutenant, I need
your ten-digit grid.

01:16:34.439 --> 01:16:35.473
Please hurry, sir.

01:16:35.539 --> 01:16:37.340
Murphy, I need those grids.
Thank you.

01:16:37.406 --> 01:16:39.942
Oh, God.

01:16:40.007 --> 01:16:41.173
Lieutenant.

01:16:41.406 --> 01:16:43.842
Lieutenant, can you hear me?
Lieutenant!

01:16:43.907 --> 01:16:45.975
Lieutenant, Get me the grids!

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:50.674
Lieutenant!

01:18:04.477 --> 01:18:08.648
Let's go, guys! Everybody,
let's move! Let's really move!

01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:10.779
Let's go, let's go!

01:18:11.577 --> 01:18:13.446
Lulu 06, Bruno 6-4.

01:18:13.511 --> 01:18:16.247
Wheels up, Ba-gram,
with QRF of 1-6 Eagles.

01:18:18.979 --> 01:18:20.646
No go, no go!

01:18:21.644 --> 01:18:22.979
No go! You're grounded!

01:18:23.244 --> 01:18:25.012
What's the fucking problem?

01:18:25.077 --> 01:18:27.848
These Black Hawks cannot
fly without Apache cover!

01:18:28.612 --> 01:18:30.613
Where are the fucking Apaches?

01:18:30.878 --> 01:18:32.947
On their way back now.
They're turning around.

01:18:33.278 --> 01:18:34.947
This is fucking unbelievable!

01:18:35.011 --> 01:18:36.011
No shit!

01:18:38.445 --> 01:18:40.480
Sir, we are four Mikes
out from the zone.

01:18:40.545 --> 01:18:41.545
Four Mikes!

01:18:42.378 --> 01:18:44.047
Look alive, gentlemen.

01:18:44.179 --> 01:18:49.117
Bruno 64 report Mike Bravo
plus five. Altimeter 2998.

01:19:06.914 --> 01:19:08.414
Where's Mike?

01:19:12.313 --> 01:19:13.648
Where's Murphy?

01:19:14.213 --> 01:19:15.448
Up top.

01:19:16.013 --> 01:19:17.515
Where up top?

01:19:17.681 --> 01:19:18.748
He's getting the QRF.

01:19:23.247 --> 01:19:24.281
Where exactly is Mike?

01:19:24.414 --> 01:19:28.084
If I knew exactly where the fuck
he was, I would tell you, brother!

01:19:28.147 --> 01:19:29.948
Is he squared away?

01:19:31.214 --> 01:19:33.115
Oh, fuck. Let me see you.

01:19:33.981 --> 01:19:35.282
Oh.

01:19:36.214 --> 01:19:37.883
Motherfuckers.

01:19:39.348 --> 01:19:41.349
Did they really shoot
me in the fucking head?

01:19:42.682 --> 01:19:44.116
Yeah, buddy.

01:19:59.348 --> 01:20:01.684
Are Mikey and Danny
really dead?

01:20:04.316 --> 01:20:05.817
I don't know.

01:20:07.283 --> 01:20:08.684
Are we dead?

01:20:10.082 --> 01:20:11.284
Negative.

01:20:12.916 --> 01:20:14.617
We're good, right?

01:20:14.784 --> 01:20:15.784
Fuck, yeah.

01:20:16.316 --> 01:20:17.751
We're solid.

01:20:23.116 --> 01:20:26.653
If I die, I need
you to make sure

01:20:26.717 --> 01:20:30.554
that Cindy knows how
much I love her.

01:20:30.617 --> 01:20:31.651
She knows.

01:20:31.717 --> 01:20:34.052
And that I died
with my brothers

01:20:35.851 --> 01:20:37.686
with a full fucking heart.

01:20:42.217 --> 01:20:44.252
You're not dying, Axe.
We're not gonna...

01:20:47.050 --> 01:20:49.853
We gotta spread out. Get
yourself some real estate.

01:20:57.218 --> 01:20:58.452
64, be advised.

01:20:58.518 --> 01:21:01.921
Negative Apache support.
LZ is too hot. Stand down.

01:21:01.985 --> 01:21:03.052
What's the problem?

01:21:03.151 --> 01:21:05.487
The Apaches were pulled.
We're grounded.

01:21:05.552 --> 01:21:06.586
Why?

01:21:06.652 --> 01:21:08.320
Some Army troops in contact.

01:21:08.385 --> 01:21:09.986
They took our gunship support.

01:21:10.452 --> 01:21:12.654
Can you put us on the
ground without the Apaches?

01:21:12.918 --> 01:21:14.020
We'll do what we have
to do to get you

01:21:14.085 --> 01:21:15.253
on the ground with your men.

01:21:15.619 --> 01:21:16.953
Thank you.

01:21:17.186 --> 01:21:20.389
Bruno 65, continue
030, we're still a go.

01:21:20.787 --> 01:21:21.953
Roger, 65.

01:21:22.019 --> 01:21:23.186
We're on our own. Stay tight.

01:21:25.385 --> 01:21:26.654
Axe?

01:21:35.386 --> 01:21:36.654
Axe?

01:21:55.688 --> 01:21:56.954
Commander, we're two Mikes out.

01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:58.699
Get your men ready. Uh-huh.
Uh, Roger that.

01:21:58.788 --> 01:22:00.723
Two Mikes! Two Mikes!

01:22:02.087 --> 01:22:03.422
Marcus!

01:22:03.887 --> 01:22:05.222
Marcus!

01:22:20.055 --> 01:22:21.289
Yeah!

01:22:23.455 --> 01:22:25.023
Bruno 64, two Mikes out. Go!

01:22:25.289 --> 01:22:27.457
Gonna be a fast infill.
Establish over watch.

01:22:30.888 --> 01:22:32.458
Rope deployed and
on the ground.

01:22:32.523 --> 01:22:33.990
Whoo! Axe!

01:22:37.955 --> 01:22:39.122
Fast infill now.

01:22:39.190 --> 01:22:42.560
Let's do this! Patton!
You're first! Move!

01:22:42.623 --> 01:22:43.823
First team member on the rope.

01:22:46.523 --> 01:22:47.624
You good?

01:22:47.856 --> 01:22:49.490
Couldn't be more good!

01:22:53.691 --> 01:22:55.024
RPG! Fuck!

01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:03.458
No.

01:23:03.624 --> 01:23:05.559
Fuck, throttle's off
throttle's off!

01:23:05.624 --> 01:23:07.559
Oh, shit, throttle's off!

01:23:07.624 --> 01:23:10.193
Brace for impact!
Brace for impact!

01:23:17.124 --> 01:23:18.291
Fucking down!

01:23:18.358 --> 01:23:20.726
Mayday, mayday!
Bruno 64 is down.

01:23:20.791 --> 01:23:22.293
Duck!

01:23:23.957 --> 01:23:25.958
Put us down! Put
us the fuck down!

01:23:28.192 --> 01:23:29.825
Put this fucking
helicopter down!

01:23:29.891 --> 01:23:31.260
Stand the fuck
down, Lieutenant.

01:23:32.125 --> 01:23:33.192
Wait!

01:23:35.425 --> 01:23:36.726
Don't you fucking stop!
Come on!

01:23:36.792 --> 01:23:38.960
Stand down, Lieutenant.
We're not going down there.

01:23:39.025 --> 01:23:40.427
Keep fucking firing!

01:23:40.493 --> 01:23:41.726
We have a fallen angel.

01:23:41.792 --> 01:23:44.228
64 is down hard.
Broke up on impact.

01:23:44.293 --> 01:23:46.161
LZ is too hot. We have
to break contact.

01:23:48.126 --> 01:23:49.293
No...

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:53.162
No, no, fucking no.

01:23:53.392 --> 01:23:54.627
Ah!

01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:30.403
Razor 11 en route to crash site,
five Mikes out, rejoining QRF.

01:26:30.733 --> 01:26:33.735
06 copy, five Mikes out. Be
advised, AO is still hot.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.534
Axe?

01:26:44.533 --> 01:26:46.002
Oh, my God.

01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:50.902
Fuck! Axe?

01:26:55.234 --> 01:26:56.568
Fuck.

01:27:47.836 --> 01:27:49.571
You see any movement?

01:27:50.004 --> 01:27:51.405
I got nothing.

01:27:52.237 --> 01:27:56.407
O6, 11. Infrared negative.
Movement negative.

01:27:56.737 --> 01:27:58.405
Copy all, 11.

01:27:58.737 --> 01:28:02.574
06, we just hit fuel reserve.
We need to come off-station.

01:28:02.903 --> 01:28:04.572
11 returning to base.

01:28:04.903 --> 01:28:06.406
Roger. Copy all.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.775
Oh, fuck.

01:30:03.909 --> 01:30:05.177
Fuck.

01:31:13.946 --> 01:31:15.147
Fuck.

01:32:35.849 --> 01:32:38.118
No. No.

01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:41.684
Stay back! Stay the fuck back!

01:32:42.349 --> 01:32:43.349
Back up!

01:32:43.817 --> 01:32:45.150
Stay back.

01:32:47.583 --> 01:32:49.418
I don't care. I fucking...

01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:05.319
What the fuck is this?
Oh, fuck.

01:33:08.718 --> 01:33:10.351
I got this.

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:53.922
No. No. No.

01:34:17.387 --> 01:34:18.387
What?

01:34:21.086 --> 01:34:23.255
You... You know where
to find Americans?

01:34:23.321 --> 01:34:24.955
America-yee.

01:34:30.554 --> 01:34:32.155
Show... Show me where we are.

01:34:39.755 --> 01:34:40.822
Are you sure? Yes.

01:34:53.155 --> 01:34:54.222
Who's that?

01:34:56.989 --> 01:34:59.156
Who's that? Who is that?

01:34:59.222 --> 01:35:01.592
Who is that? Who is that?
Who is that?

01:35:01.656 --> 01:35:04.692
You see? Do you see what I have?
I'll fucking kill you!

01:35:04.989 --> 01:35:06.055
I will fucking kill you!

01:35:06.323 --> 01:35:08.401
Is he... Is he Taliban? Is
he Taliban? Is he Taliban?

01:35:10.489 --> 01:35:12.807
I will fucking kill you. I will
fucking kill you right now.

01:35:14.857 --> 01:35:16.390
I know he fucking
knows something.

01:35:16.456 --> 01:35:19.025
You tell him I will
fucking kill him.

01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:20.990
Look at me in my fucking eyes

01:35:21.056 --> 01:35:23.592
and you ask me if you
think I give a fuck!

01:35:23.657 --> 01:35:25.991
I don't care. I don't go
home, you don't go home.

01:35:26.056 --> 01:35:27.090
You hear me?

01:35:27.156 --> 01:35:29.158
I fucking kill you!
I kill you.

01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:35.059
Why do you help me?
Why do you help me?

01:35:35.457 --> 01:35:36.624
Do you help me?

01:35:38.324 --> 01:35:39.525
Yes. Can I trust you?

01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:40.925
America-yee.

01:35:42.591 --> 01:35:43.758
Okay.

01:35:45.157 --> 01:35:46.291
Okay.

01:35:47.791 --> 01:35:50.894
There's an American base located
here. Give this to them.

01:35:51.358 --> 01:35:53.159
Tell them where I am.
Tell them where I am.

01:35:53.258 --> 01:35:54.559
America-yee. Okay?

01:37:23.562 --> 01:37:26.865

Fuck you, America!

01:37:42.696 --> 01:37:43.862

01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:51.598
Fuck! Fuck!

01:37:51.697 --> 01:37:54.633
I'm gonna cut your head off and
send it to your fucking American...

01:37:57.963 --> 01:37:58.997
Yeah, fuck you!

01:38:47.931 --> 01:38:49.768
Why are you doing this for me?

01:38:52.099 --> 01:38:54.067
Fuck Taliban. Fuck Taliban.

01:39:04.667 --> 01:39:06.635
I need a knife.

01:39:09.033 --> 01:39:10.468
A knife. Cut.

01:39:10.833 --> 01:39:12.001
Knife.

01:39:12.667 --> 01:39:14.468
You know, knife? Cut.

01:39:15.367 --> 01:39:17.368
Okay? Go get a knife.

01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.634
Knife.

01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:22.638
Yes! Yes, a knife, to cut.
Okay? Go.

01:39:23.167 --> 01:39:26.003
Go get me a knife.
Please? Please.

01:39:45.101 --> 01:39:47.404
No, I... I said a knife.
That's not a knife.

01:39:48.068 --> 01:39:49.169
Knife.

01:39:49.435 --> 01:39:52.004
No. It's not a knife.
It's a fucking duck!

01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:56.005
I need a knife. You know, knife?
To cut.

01:39:56.269 --> 01:39:57.470

01:39:59.735 --> 01:40:00.903
I need a knife.

01:40:01.935 --> 01:40:03.704
A knife... You know, a knife?

01:40:03.769 --> 01:40:04.970

For my leg. Please.

01:40:20.370 --> 01:40:21.838
Give me the knife, for my leg.

01:40:39.571 --> 01:40:40.771
Fuck.

01:44:27.748 --> 01:44:29.082

Texas.

01:44:32.814 --> 01:44:34.215

01:44:35.214 --> 01:44:37.383

01:44:41.714 --> 01:44:43.383
Texas.

01:44:55.049 --> 01:44:56.317
Why are you doing this for me?

01:45:09.383 --> 01:45:11.151
Sir, we have a verified letter

01:45:11.216 --> 01:45:12.416

01:45:12.482 --> 01:45:15.201
I want all available CSAR up in the

Put me everything in the air.
Yes, sir.

01:45:26.051 --> 01:45:27.451
Gentlemen, keep your lines free. Those
guys are busy at the other end.

01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:29.350
All non-essential personnel,
get the fuck out!

01:46:20.919 --> 01:46:23.354

01:47:17.256 --> 01:47:18.356
Chaku.

01:47:53.923 --> 01:47:56.025
Tallying multiple hostiles.
Are we clear to engage?

01:47:58.091 --> 01:48:00.026
Razor 12, you are
clear to engage.

01:48:23.358 --> 01:48:25.593
Contact right! Contact right!

01:48:25.925 --> 01:48:27.059
Two on the le Ft!

01:48:29.025 --> 01:48:30.358
We're clear right!

01:48:30.592 --> 01:48:32.927
Halo 4-1. Visual red smoke.

01:48:37.592 --> 01:48:39.927
Halo 4-2, you are
cleared for the zone.

01:48:40.259 --> 01:48:42.861
Halo 4-2. Established low block.
On approach.

01:48:44.492 --> 01:48:45.961
Ninety feet, 45 knots.

01:48:46.392 --> 01:48:48.161
Clear forward. Down right.

01:48:48.225 --> 01:48:49.860
Clear to the LZ.

01:48:57.659 --> 01:48:58.660
Let's go. Move.

01:48:59.593 --> 01:49:00.860
Go. Go, go, go, go.

01:49:00.926 --> 01:49:02.093
There's an American!
In the door!

01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:03.294
What do you see?
What do you see?

01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:04.928
Any Americans?

01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:07.161
American? This way?

01:49:07.226 --> 01:49:08.527

Let me see your hands!

01:49:17.094 --> 01:49:18.595
Are you Marcus Luttrell?

01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:21.228
You're safe, Marcus.
You're going home.

01:49:21.361 --> 01:49:22.395
Coming out!

01:49:22.527 --> 01:49:24.896
Outside, walking him
out, coming outside.

01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:26.295
Here we go, all right, Marcus.

01:49:27.261 --> 01:49:28.930
Hey, hey, watch yourself here!
Watch it!

01:49:28.995 --> 01:49:30.261
Come on, we gotta go, we
gotta go. He comes with me.

01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:32.196
Sir. That's not going
to happen, sir.

01:49:32.527 --> 01:49:34.428
You can stay here.
You'll be safe.

01:49:34.494 --> 01:49:38.264
You can't come with us. These guys
will take care of you. You'll be safe.

01:49:40.595 --> 01:49:41.929
Wait! Wait!

01:49:42.728 --> 01:49:44.696
Thank you. Thank you!

Let's go! I'm sorry, Marcus,
we gotta move. Let's go.

01:49:59.529 --> 01:50:00.529
Thank you.

01:50:01.929 --> 01:50:03.764
Let's go, we got to go!

01:50:04.596 --> 01:50:07.398
Got him. He'll be fine.
I got you. Thank you.

01:50:07.462 --> 01:50:09.531
Let's go! Let's move,
come on, here we go.

01:50:09.629 --> 01:50:10.963
Come on, we're
wheels up in 30.

01:50:11.064 --> 01:50:13.231
Come on, Marcus. Easy.

01:50:14.997 --> 01:50:16.163
Here we go, Marcus.

01:50:20.597 --> 01:50:23.098
Jackpot! Say again, jackpot!
We got him!

01:50:39.865 --> 01:50:42.734
Patient upgraded to urgent
surgical. Prepare units of blood.

01:50:46.798 --> 01:50:49.934
Multiple gunshot wounds
found on secondary survey.

01:50:54.131 --> 01:50:56.800
Update ready to follow.
Say when ready to copy.

01:50:59.298 --> 01:51:02.467
Brave men have fought and died
building the proud tradition

01:51:02.531 --> 01:51:05.801
and fear of reputation
that I am bound to uphold.

01:51:14.465 --> 01:51:16.634
I died up on that Mountain.

01:51:18.732 --> 01:51:20.233
No pulse. Okay, start CPR.

01:51:20.299 --> 01:51:21.768
One, two, three...

01:51:22.366 --> 01:51:24.568
There is no question

01:51:24.632 --> 01:51:27.969
a part of me will forever be
up on that Mountain, dead...

01:51:28.165 --> 01:51:30.101
As my brothers died.

01:51:31.266 --> 01:51:35.036
But there is a part of me that
lived because of my brothers.

01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:37.968
Because of them, I
am still alive.

01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:41.871
And I can never forget that
no matter how much it hurts,

01:51:41.934 --> 01:51:45.002
how dark it gets, or
how far you fall...

01:51:46.533 --> 01:51:48.869
Hey, Luttrell. Luttrell!

01:51:56.001 --> 01:51:57.269
We got a pulse.

01:51:57.534 --> 01:52:00.236
..you are never
out of the fight.

01:52:00.436 --> 01:52:04.336
