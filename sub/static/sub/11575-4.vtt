WEBVTT

01:01.437 --> 01:02.847
One word:

01:03.814 --> 01:04.394
epic.

01:04.649 --> 01:06.310
Oh.
[Laughing]

01:07.735 --> 01:08.520
After last
night's marathon,

01:08.778 --> 01:11.144
I didn't think I'd get
lucky again so soon.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.906
Well, you could get
lucky times two.

01:13.157 --> 01:14.397
Oh. Oh!

01:14.659 --> 01:15.523
Times three...

01:15.785 --> 01:17.195
Times four...

01:18.246 --> 01:20.578
I haven't organized
my swabs in a week,

01:20.831 --> 01:23.243
and l have cultures
growing so out of control

01:23.501 --> 01:25.913
that my actual control
cultures have mutated,

01:26.170 --> 01:29.003
and l have a delivery
of formaldehyde in...

01:29.257 --> 01:30.246
thirty minutes.

01:30.800 --> 01:32.540
Say "formaldehyde"
again.

01:32.802 --> 01:35.259
l have a million
things on my "to do" list.

01:35.513 --> 01:38.050
I thought that l was
your "to do" list.

01:40.810 --> 01:41.970
Fine.

01:43.187 --> 01:44.051
You are released.

01:44.313 --> 01:45.268
Mmm...

01:46.649 --> 01:47.684
I'm gonna go
freshen up.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.227
Okay.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.123
Ugh--

02:08.337 --> 02:09.713
LAUREN: Bo?
Everything all right?

02:09.964 --> 02:11.579
Everything's amazing!

02:13.843 --> 02:15.799
Just amazing...

02:27.982 --> 02:29.222
DYSON:
Excuse me?

02:29.608 --> 02:31.394
It is going to
be amazing, no?!

02:31.652 --> 02:33.233
I gotta go
with "no," dude.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.863
Stop.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.573
I remember hearing
about Philippe Petit,

02:36.824 --> 02:38.735
the famous tightrope
walker when l was about six.

02:38.993 --> 02:41.405
I knew then that I
wanted to be like him.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.868
This is my dream.

02:43.122 --> 02:44.578
Well, there you have it.
Man's living his dream.

02:44.832 --> 02:45.582
Can we go now?

02:45.833 --> 02:47.539
Can you at least
pretend to try?

02:47.793 --> 02:48.623
Hey, Lloyd!

02:48.878 --> 02:51.085
How about I take a couple
of photos for posterity?

02:51.339 --> 02:53.796
Ah! Bien sur.
A most excellent idea.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.628
That's a great pose.

02:56.969 --> 02:57.833
You are so bad at this.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.586
The man wants to live out
his crazy circus fantasy.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.258
Who cares?
Live and let live.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.380
That's so typically
Dark of you.

03:03.642 --> 03:04.677
What, saying it like it is?

03:04.935 --> 03:06.141
There've been four

03:06.395 --> 03:08.101
crazy human stunts
pulled in this last week.

03:08.356 --> 03:09.596
Remember how the
first three ended up?

03:09.857 --> 03:11.563
You mean Splat,
Squish, Ka-boom?

03:11.817 --> 03:12.772
Uh huh.

03:13.736 --> 03:15.442
That's nice, Lloyd,
another one like that.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.561
Well, at each of those,
I smelled Fae.

03:17.823 --> 03:18.687
Something's killing
these people,

03:18.949 --> 03:20.530
I'm gonna find
out what it is.

03:20.785 --> 03:21.240
That's great, Lloyd.

03:21.494 --> 03:23.280
l have a hot
date with a guy

03:23.537 --> 03:25.118
rockin' an eight
pack in an hour,

03:25.373 --> 03:27.113
so can we hurry
this up a little?

03:27.375 --> 03:28.330
Hey, Magnifico!

03:28.584 --> 03:30.120
You know this is
stupid, right?

03:30.378 --> 03:31.333
[Laughing]

03:31.712 --> 03:32.462
That's really great.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.499
Why don't you stand back,
I got this. Lloyd!

03:34.757 --> 03:36.748
No, please, sir!
Step back.

03:37.301 --> 03:39.587
What I am about to
attempt is very dangerous.

03:39.845 --> 03:40.925
Just one more question--

03:41.180 --> 03:42.590
No, no! It's not
the time for questions.

03:42.848 --> 03:45.134
It's the time to dream!

03:45.393 --> 03:46.633
It's the time to live!

03:46.894 --> 03:48.100
Woo!

03:52.525 --> 03:53.105
Lloyd!

03:53.359 --> 03:54.644
LLOYD: Ahh!

03:54.985 --> 03:55.610
[Crash]

03:55.861 --> 04:02.482
[Car alarm sounding]

04:02.743 --> 04:04.074
Yeah.

04:04.829 --> 04:06.694
You got this.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.745
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.414
It's harder when you don't
know what you are.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.961
My love carries
a death sentence.

04:17.842 --> 04:19.798
l was lost for years...

04:20.511 --> 04:22.467
Searching while hiding...

04:23.013 --> 04:26.346
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

04:27.393 --> 04:28.599
I won't hide anymore.

04:28.853 --> 04:31.560
I will live
the life I choose.

04:38.988 --> 04:39.818
KENZI:
Bo-apalooza?

04:40.072 --> 04:41.027
Bo-Bo?

04:41.699 --> 04:42.449
Bo-ilicious?

04:42.700 --> 04:43.564
Bo-dacious?

04:43.826 --> 04:47.569
Do we seriously not have
any chocolate in this place?

04:47.830 --> 04:48.785
Bo!

04:51.709 --> 04:53.665
Did you just throw
a pillow at me?

04:54.003 --> 04:55.288
That is a
good question.

04:55.546 --> 04:58.128
that I would like to answer
in two parts: a) Yes,

04:58.382 --> 05:01.124
b) I would love to
have a heart-to-heart,

05:01.385 --> 05:03.125
thank you so much
for asking.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.127
Can we do it later,
Kenz? Please?

05:05.389 --> 05:06.799
I've got chocolate
in my purse.

05:08.726 --> 05:09.806
What's on your mind?

05:11.020 --> 05:11.975
Well.

05:13.689 --> 05:14.849
It's kind of a
delicate subject.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.267
Like Southern
Belle delicate.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.607
And I don't know how
you're gonna take it,

05:18.861 --> 05:21.102
but I just can't keep it
from you any longer.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.227
Is this about Lauren?

05:22.490 --> 05:24.651
It's about something that's
been a big bug up my butt

05:24.909 --> 05:25.773
for a couple
of months now.

05:26.035 --> 05:27.741
We spend too much
time together.

05:27.995 --> 05:28.745
You've never
liked her--

05:28.996 --> 05:30.577
C'est tout le contraire,
mon cheri.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.662
Ever since I saw her
get all Science-y

05:32.917 --> 05:35.579
on The Morrigan's evil ass
plot, I lurves me some Lauren.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.451
Well, good because
she's very lurve-able.

05:37.713 --> 05:40.125
And from what I hear,
super bang-able.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.794
Why is everything
always about sex?

05:43.177 --> 05:46.886
Uh... wonder snatch?
Hi! Have we met?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.880
You don't have chocolate
in your purse, do you?

05:50.142 --> 05:51.678
Technically, nyet.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.227
I'm going
to the store.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.897
Wicked,
wicked Norn...

06:04.198 --> 06:05.859
What did you do to me?

06:06.867 --> 06:07.902
Ugh!

06:11.872 --> 06:12.782
Woo!

06:13.040 --> 06:14.621
Girl be thirsty.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.957
What happened to your date
with Mr. Eight Pack?

06:17.211 --> 06:19.293
Hmm, girl only
needs ten minutes.

06:19.547 --> 06:20.627
That's way too
much information.

06:20.881 --> 06:21.961
Tox screen on
the street pizza?

06:22.216 --> 06:23.626
Can you
not call him that?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.465
Tox screen
on the street pasta?

06:25.719 --> 06:26.674
Nice.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.385
You can see he
wasn't on anything.

06:28.639 --> 06:31.551
Well, it's still a suicide.
So, case closed.

06:31.809 --> 06:34.266
Among all these other
"suicides?" Come on.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.387
Look, I'm telling you, | smelled
something Fae on that roof.

06:37.648 --> 06:39.184
We need to start
this entire investigation

06:39.441 --> 06:39.941
from the beginning.

06:40.192 --> 06:41.181
It's the better way.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.193
It's the only way.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.729
No, no, no.
Look at this.

06:43.988 --> 06:45.478
The vics from
the last ten days.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.115
Notice anything?

06:50.202 --> 06:50.987
They were all patients.

06:51.245 --> 06:54.328
Of The Better Way Clinic
For Health and Wellness.

06:54.582 --> 06:55.992
You can
thank me later.

06:57.042 --> 06:57.827
Um--

06:58.085 --> 06:59.950
This is the part where we
go question therapists.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.328
Yeah, who, due to doctor/patient
confidentiality,

07:02.590 --> 07:04.376
won't tell us
a damn thing.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.333
Okay.
So we go undercover.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.630
I could be
a great therapist.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.343
We're trying to
prevent these people

07:10.598 --> 07:12.008
from killing
themselves, Tamsin...

07:12.433 --> 07:14.594
What do you suggest?

07:16.228 --> 07:17.729
Sure. Great.
I'll do it.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.516
You haven't even
heard what 'it' is.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.559
Well, let's just say--

07:24.028 --> 07:25.859
I could use
the distraction.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.070
Okay.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.779
I need you to pose as a
therapist at a new age clinic.

07:33.037 --> 07:35.870
How am I supposed to convince
the clinic that I'm a doctor?

07:36.123 --> 07:37.408
Ta-da.

07:37.916 --> 07:38.780
Dr. Helen Green.

07:39.043 --> 07:40.328
Of The Sedona Center
for Psychological

07:40.586 --> 07:41.951
and Spiritual Healing?

07:42.212 --> 07:43.713
I couldn't have
gone to Harvard?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.295
You haven't
seen the clinic.

07:45.549 --> 07:46.664
What am
I looking for?

07:46.925 --> 07:49.462
Well, this is a list
of all our vics.

07:49.762 --> 07:51.627
We need you to access
their patient files.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.629
Find out why they're
doing these crazy stunts

07:53.891 --> 07:54.801
and killing themselves.

07:55.059 --> 07:57.596
Hm. Sounds, uh...

08:01.857 --> 08:03.017
...de|icious.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.939
If I didn't know any better
I'd think you looked a little...

08:08.197 --> 08:09.778
Smart?
Gorgeous? Tall?

08:10.032 --> 08:11.238
...Hungry.

08:12.034 --> 08:13.774
You and Lauren didn't--
Did you?

08:14.036 --> 08:14.525
No!

08:14.787 --> 08:16.618
And p.s. our sex
life is awesome.

08:16.872 --> 08:19.329
Maybe a little
too awesome.

08:19.583 --> 08:20.948
Okay.
Just asking.

08:21.210 --> 08:22.620
I think, though,
someone here

08:22.878 --> 08:24.869
has had enough coffee
for the day...

08:27.758 --> 08:29.589
What kind of
therapist am | anyway?

08:31.887 --> 08:34.799
Oh you've got
to be kidding me.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.473
Hi there!

08:42.731 --> 08:43.766
Namaste.

08:44.024 --> 08:44.979
Oh!

08:45.859 --> 08:46.769
Lemony.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.062
It will help
to create synergy

08:48.320 --> 08:49.856
and centeredness
during your appointment.

08:50.114 --> 08:51.479
Actually,
I'm the new doctor.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.116
Oh, Dr. Green!

08:53.367 --> 08:55.608
So sorry I wasn't there to
greet you when you came in.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.609
l was only told this morning
that you were coming,

08:57.871 --> 08:59.372
but when I heard,
I was so excited

08:59.623 --> 09:01.909
| about fell out
of my sun salutation.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.668
We've been super-swamped
since Dr. De Angelis

09:03.919 --> 09:04.749
up and left us.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.415
Yes, I heard the clinic's
been having some bad luck.

09:07.673 --> 09:08.423
Bad luck?

09:08.674 --> 09:09.789
Patients dying?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.335
|n strange
and unusual ways?

09:11.593 --> 09:13.970
Oh, Gaia help us,
it's been so awful.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.633
Dr. Hope's been super
emotional about it...

09:16.890 --> 09:19.472
though that could have more
to do with her recent divorce.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.092
Dr. Foster is
kind of in denial.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.765
And Dr. Palmer is
taking it the hardest.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.011
He's our
regression therapist.

09:25.274 --> 09:27.686
What about Dr.
Nemo and Dr. Bob?

09:27.943 --> 09:28.648
Oh--
[Laughing]

09:28.902 --> 09:29.812
This is Dr. Nemo.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.810
And Dr. Bob is
our resident kitty.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.154
He usually hangs out
in Dr. Palmer's office.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.774
Oh, well, I should let
you get back to work.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.026
Actually, it is the
other way around.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.528
Your eleven
o'clock is here.

09:41.832 --> 09:42.787
Good luck!

09:47.421 --> 09:48.376
So, Connor...

09:49.173 --> 09:52.040
How do you feel about
what Manny just said?

09:52.301 --> 09:53.165
lnsulted.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.635
I mean, I do not use my job
as an excuse to avoid sex.

09:56.889 --> 09:59.631
So you had to drive to the
hospital at 10:30 last night?

09:59.892 --> 10:01.132
For bloodwork.
That saves people.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.633
You're a dermatologist.

10:02.895 --> 10:04.431
So, Connor,
you're a doctor...

10:04.688 --> 10:05.973
That's very
important stuff.

10:06.231 --> 10:09.143
But Manny here
has certain needs.

10:09.401 --> 10:10.641
You're talking about
sex, aren't you?

10:10.903 --> 10:13.315
Which, by the way,
we're having all the time.

10:13.572 --> 10:14.152
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.271
Is that dermatology
speak for hardly ever?

10:16.533 --> 10:18.034
How many times a
week are you having sex?

10:18.285 --> 10:18.489
Three times!

10:18.744 --> 10:20.700
Three... times...

10:20.954 --> 10:22.034
--That's it?!
--Hm.

10:22.289 --> 10:22.994
How do you survive?

10:23.248 --> 10:24.533
Are you taking his side?

10:24.792 --> 10:25.531
Just let her speak.

10:25.793 --> 10:26.828
Where'd you go
to school again?

10:27.085 --> 10:29.121
l have an impact
statement I'd like to read.

10:29.254 --> 10:29.709
BO / CONNOR:
Oh brother.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.578
Okay, wait!
Wait--

10:31.840 --> 10:33.922
Let me just try
something here.

10:38.764 --> 10:39.924
Look at each other.

10:44.061 --> 10:46.643
These are the faces
that you fell in love with.

10:48.482 --> 10:50.188
These are the bodies...

10:51.068 --> 10:53.275
...that need
to express themselves.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.021
That are longing
for each other.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.282
Aching...

11:00.911 --> 11:02.276
...for each other.

11:09.253 --> 11:10.584
Oh! Wait!

11:10.838 --> 11:12.169
Guys! No!
Not here...

11:12.422 --> 11:13.673
Guys, not here!
No!

11:13.924 --> 11:15.710
We can be home
in 5 minutes.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.708
Ten if we pick up
whipped cream.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.922
Tabitha, I'm
going for lunch!

11:27.062 --> 11:28.142
You know
what I'm craving?

11:28.397 --> 11:29.637
A really nice
back massage?

11:29.898 --> 11:30.683
Lower.

11:30.941 --> 11:33.102
Bo, it's just--
I'm just so busy--

11:33.360 --> 11:35.817
Are you using work as
an avoidance technique?

11:36.071 --> 11:36.981
Where's that
coming from?

11:37.239 --> 11:39.525
It's just, one of my
patients at the clinic

11:39.783 --> 11:40.533
was talking about it.

11:40.784 --> 11:41.648
Your patients?

11:41.910 --> 11:43.525
[Laughing]
You're taking patients?

11:43.787 --> 11:44.367
Yeah!

11:44.621 --> 11:45.997
l have to say, this
whole doctor thing

11:46.248 --> 11:47.454
isn't as hard as
I thought it'd be.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.450
Although I should probably
crack a book or two.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.667
Yeah, yeah--
Maybe I can help.

11:52.921 --> 11:53.876
Actually.

11:54.256 --> 11:56.963
We have the basics--
Jung, Freud.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.128
And then there's of course
Masters and Johnson.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.967
You'll also want
to review Kinsey.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.176
[Thud]

12:03.390 --> 12:04.971
Do we have
a problem here?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.967
Bo, masquerading as a therapist
is a serious ethical offense.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.970
Not to mention the fact
you're completely unqualified.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.317
Oh, I see.

12:14.568 --> 12:15.648
So, you think I
lack the intellectual

12:15.903 --> 12:17.643
whatchamacallit to pull off
this fake doctor crap.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.645
You're not gonna
learn how to do it

12:19.907 --> 12:21.147
from a book in an hour.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.944
I suppose I need
8 billion hours

12:23.201 --> 12:24.190
looking through
telescopes, like you!

12:24.453 --> 12:25.659
They're microscopes!
And I guess

12:25.913 --> 12:27.653
being a doctor would
look easy to somebody

12:27.915 --> 12:29.371
who never even
finished High School.

12:31.919 --> 12:32.704
Wow.

12:32.961 --> 12:33.825
Bo, I didn't mean that.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.123
Look at the time.
l have to go.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.002
l have clients.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.679
In the dream, I work
for the war office,

12:46.934 --> 12:49.846
and it's my job to buy
the country's submarines.

12:50.103 --> 12:50.853
Go on.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.844
So, there's submarines
from all over the world.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.312
There's a huge
Brazilian sub--

12:54.566 --> 12:56.227
lt's packed
with naval officers.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.021
And then there's
a French sub--

12:58.278 --> 13:01.190
It comes with a heat-seeking
missile and a gourmet kitchen.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.688
And then there's
my husband.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.690
Your husband's
on a submarine?

13:04.952 --> 13:06.817
My husband is
a submarine.

13:07.079 --> 13:08.285
But, he's
a little dinky

13:08.538 --> 13:10.620
and his periscope's
a little rusty...

13:10.874 --> 13:12.239
So, when it comes
time to choose--

13:12.501 --> 13:13.035
Yes?

13:13.293 --> 13:14.373
Well, I choose the
Brazilian sub

13:14.628 --> 13:16.038
and | buy the
French sub.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.708
| buy and | buy
and | buy, and then--

13:18.966 --> 13:19.705
And your husband?

13:19.967 --> 13:20.922
I put him
on layaway.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.712
What do you think
that means?

13:22.970 --> 13:24.085
Uh...

13:30.936 --> 13:33.348
Leave the coffee
table alone, Rolly.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.391
Dr. Palmer will
be in soon.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.736
You said the bathroom was
just down the hall?

13:43.991 --> 13:45.026
Mmhmm.

13:45.283 --> 13:46.614
They call me
Captain Humongous.

13:46.868 --> 13:47.698
I'm sure they do.

13:47.953 --> 13:51.070
This hand can stop a moving
car dead in its tracks.

13:51.623 --> 13:52.578
Wow.

14:05.429 --> 14:06.339
[Meow]

14:06.596 --> 14:08.882
Hey, Dr. Bob.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.326
Dr. Palmer--

14:32.622 --> 14:35.659
|, um... I was just about
to leave you a note.

14:35.917 --> 14:36.827
Oh?

14:37.085 --> 14:38.200
Yes, I'm
Dr. Helen Green.

14:38.462 --> 14:40.123
I'm thrilled to be
joining everyone here

14:40.380 --> 14:42.371
at the Better Way,
but I have to admit,

14:42.632 --> 14:44.372
I'm a little rusty on
my regression therapy.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.670
And l was hoping to
review the fundamentals.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.179
I would be delighted.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.920
Oh--
Thank you.

14:50.182 --> 14:52.468
I know Bo's got a
lot of stuff going on,

14:52.726 --> 14:54.682
but Kenzi's got
a lot of stuff too!

14:54.936 --> 14:57.188
Kenzi's got
butt-loads of stuff.

14:57.439 --> 14:58.929
Hale, I gotta unload
'cause I might've

14:59.191 --> 15:00.727
done something that's
coming back at me

15:00.984 --> 15:02.940
in a big, yucky way.

15:03.612 --> 15:04.317
Hale!

15:04.571 --> 15:06.903
Sorry, what do you gotta
unload out of your butt?

15:07.449 --> 15:09.360
Okay, I'm listening.
What's up?

15:09.618 --> 15:11.859
Okay, so you remember
a couple of months back

15:12.120 --> 15:13.701
when Ia merde
was hitting la fan?

15:13.955 --> 15:16.697
Well, | sort of got
comfy with a chainsaw

15:16.958 --> 15:18.038
and I went to see--

15:18.293 --> 15:19.408
[Phone ringing]
Hello?

15:22.005 --> 15:22.915
An apology letter?

15:23.173 --> 15:25.209
How was I supposed to know
I couldn't look him in the feet?

15:25.467 --> 15:27.003
That's where
his eyes are!

15:27.260 --> 15:29.967
Yeah, fine--
Just put it on the list.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.470
Of the million things
I gotta do...

15:32.724 --> 15:35.261
Anyway, I got all power-hungry
with a power tool and |--

15:35.519 --> 15:38.181
Little mama, I'm up to my
moonshine here in Ash biz.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.518
Can we do
lunch Friday?

15:39.773 --> 15:40.523
Fﬁday?

15:40.774 --> 15:42.230
Yeah, I have
a mega appointment

15:42.484 --> 15:45.021
l have to prep for in--
thirty minutes.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.233
I guess...

15:46.780 --> 15:48.520
Wait, is that what
you're wearing?

15:48.782 --> 15:50.022
Yeah. Why?

15:50.283 --> 15:53.775
Dude, you are the leader
of the Light Fae, hello?

15:54.037 --> 15:56.073
You need to start
dressing like the leader

15:56.331 --> 15:58.037
of the Light Fae.
Okay?

15:58.291 --> 16:00.873
The sports coat is
like waaaay caj.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.369
And the shoes, I can't even
talk about the shoes.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.040
Obviously you
need a stylist.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.208
Uh huh.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.502
And I suppose you're just
the fly-girl to do it, huh?

16:08.760 --> 16:11.376
Why, Mr. Ash...

16:11.638 --> 16:12.502
I'd be delighted!

16:12.764 --> 16:14.095
l have so many ideas.

16:14.349 --> 16:16.556
I'm thinking like,
silk ties and tailored suits.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.220
Your basic Ocean's
Eleven special--

16:18.478 --> 16:21.595
Okay, okay, okay...
Just don't go too crazy, huh?

16:23.483 --> 16:26.316
The Ash has his
own black platinum?

16:26.570 --> 16:29.232
Honey, the black platinum
ain't got nothing on that.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.239
Thank you!
Thank you!

16:30.490 --> 16:30.899
Okay.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.274
You will not
regret this.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.240
How do we feel
about ascots...?

16:37.789 --> 16:39.120
So, you hypnotize
your patients.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.239
Only to help them access
the repressed memories

16:41.501 --> 16:43.082
that impact negatively on
their everyday lives.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.918
I like to think that some things
are best left forgotten.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.538
But some of our most
treasured memories

16:47.799 --> 16:49.460
and dreams are repressed.

16:50.468 --> 16:51.969
That's strange--

16:55.140 --> 16:58.257
You know, I think I might have
his cell number somewhere.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.554
And where did
you go, Tabitha?

17:08.653 --> 17:09.733
Rolly, stop!

17:10.655 --> 17:12.270
|'m Captain Humongous!

17:12.532 --> 17:14.909
Able to stop
cars with one hand...

17:15.160 --> 17:15.615
Ugh!

17:15.869 --> 17:18.611
lift thousands
of pounds...

17:19.331 --> 17:22.073
And take anybody out
with one punch--

17:22.334 --> 17:24.916
The only thing you're going
to do is hurt yourself.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.751
See, you've
already got a cut.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.587
It is the Devilish
super-villain

17:33.845 --> 17:35.085
and his cavalcade
of weaponized vehicles.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.336
Or not.

17:44.814 --> 17:45.223
[Honking]

17:45.482 --> 17:46.437
Stop!

17:46.733 --> 17:47.848
[Thud]

17:53.782 --> 17:56.273
It's okay.
I'm okay, go.

17:59.496 --> 18:00.576
Come on.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.381
BO: That should slow you
down for a bit...

18:15.303 --> 18:16.338
Tabitha?

18:18.139 --> 18:18.969
Tabitha!

18:19.224 --> 18:21.055
It's not what
it looks like--

18:21.476 --> 18:23.091
Something's pushing the
patients over the edge,

18:23.353 --> 18:24.138
but it's not me.

18:24.396 --> 18:25.226
So you are Fae.

18:25.480 --> 18:26.720
A Mayan lxtab.

18:28.316 --> 18:29.066
A suicide Fae.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.818
Sounds like
a confession to me.

18:31.903 --> 18:34.485
God. Stop moving.
You're so bendy!

18:34.739 --> 18:35.524
Twelve years of yoga!

18:35.782 --> 18:37.022
And a lifetime of killing!

18:37.284 --> 18:37.568
Not anymore.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.157
Please, don't hurt me.

18:39.411 --> 18:40.491
I'm in therapy!

18:40.745 --> 18:41.370
So, why are you here?

18:41.621 --> 18:43.532
I can't help but feed
off their remains.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.577
I mean, they're right there,
and I'm so hungry.

18:46.835 --> 18:47.699
You wouldn't
understand.

18:47.961 --> 18:48.950
Oh, you'd
be surprised.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.168
Please, I'm telling
you the truth.

18:51.423 --> 18:54.335
Why don't you tell it to the
Fae cops that I'm calling?

18:54.592 --> 18:55.547
[Whack]

18:55.802 --> 18:57.963
l'm
s
o
rry'

19:05.478 --> 19:06.433
Rolly.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.430
Come on, baby.
Come on.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.977
[Gasping]

19:12.235 --> 19:13.350
Oh, come on.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.027
Oh, God.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.921
It's a good thing we were
able to trace your cellphone.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.210
I'm fine.

19:36.468 --> 19:37.833
Really? You let
an lxtab get away.

19:38.094 --> 19:38.924
That's not like you, Bo.

19:39.179 --> 19:42.137
Yeah, aren't you supposed to
be unbeatable or something?

19:42.390 --> 19:44.096
At least we got an ID
on the killer now.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.591
I'm not so sure
about that.

19:45.852 --> 19:46.557
She's a suicide Fae.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.142
Who's in therapy!

19:48.396 --> 19:50.261
Besides, none of these victims
are committing suicide.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.023
Splitting hairs.

19:51.274 --> 19:52.605
It's like Occam's
beard-trimmer.

19:52.859 --> 19:53.439
Razor.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.398
Whatever!

19:54.652 --> 19:56.108
The simplest solution is
usually the right one.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.604
Once we track this Mayan
honey down, slap some steel

19:58.865 --> 20:00.730
on her wrists, this
case will be closed.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.948
I don't know what
I like about her more:

20:03.203 --> 20:04.568
her warmth
or her charm.

20:04.829 --> 20:05.739
Mmhmm.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.373
You need to refuel.

20:07.624 --> 20:08.659
Don't worry.

20:10.502 --> 20:11.787
I'm on it.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.548
I'm sorry
about earlier.

20:19.803 --> 20:20.542
Oh, me too.

20:20.804 --> 20:22.760
This whole case
has me on edge.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.593
You know that
I think you're smart?

20:25.850 --> 20:26.225
Mmhmm.

20:26.476 --> 20:27.101
And funny.

20:27.352 --> 20:29.308
--Mmhmm.
--And beautiful.

20:34.526 --> 20:36.812
I think your suicide
Fae is innocent.

20:37.821 --> 20:38.731
Ugh...

20:38.988 --> 20:40.774
The tightrope walker had
a complete depletion

20:41.032 --> 20:43.318
of serotonin and
endorphins in his body.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.441
Well, that's
unusual, isn't it?

20:45.703 --> 20:48.115
The fall alone would have
caused a spike in adrenaline.

20:48.373 --> 20:49.237
He had none.

20:49.499 --> 20:51.706
Something is getting
these victims excited

20:51.960 --> 20:53.700
and then feeding off their
bursts of adrenaline.

20:53.962 --> 20:57.045
Not the usual despair that
would satisfy a suicide Fae.

20:57.298 --> 20:58.287
Exactly.

20:59.509 --> 21:00.624
Why, Doctor...

21:00.885 --> 21:03.592
I think you've just
reopened this case.

21:06.933 --> 21:07.968
Are you okay?

21:09.686 --> 21:10.721
Yeah.

21:10.979 --> 21:12.219
Absolutely.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.441
I can't believe you
are so close-minded.

21:18.695 --> 21:21.277
And I can't believe you suddenly
think you grew a badge!

21:21.531 --> 21:22.862
We need to investigate
the clinic further!

21:23.116 --> 21:25.528
What we need is to locate
our annoying little lxtab.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.410
She didn't do this.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.617
Ugh. You are clearly
out of your mind.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.453
Dyson!
Help me out here, dude.

21:30.707 --> 21:32.743
I think we need
to hear Bo out.

21:34.335 --> 21:38.544
Even if Tabitha is culpable,
she most likely has a partner.

21:38.798 --> 21:39.833
Like who?

21:40.091 --> 21:42.252
Dr. Palmer hypnotizes his
patients during regression therapy.

21:42.510 --> 21:43.716
What if he's
hypnotizing them

21:43.970 --> 21:45.585
into performing
these deadly acts.

21:45.847 --> 21:46.711
You think he's Fae?

21:46.973 --> 21:47.678
I don't know.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.218
But both Lloyd and
Rolly were his patients,

21:50.477 --> 21:52.718
and what about those
articles I found on his desk?

21:52.979 --> 21:55.561
I'm sorry, do I hear
a plan in here anywhere?

21:55.815 --> 21:57.555
We send someone
in undercover.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.398
Let's see what
really goes on

21:59.652 --> 22:00.812
during one
of his sessions.

22:01.529 --> 22:03.440
All right--
All right, I'll do it.

22:03.823 --> 22:07.361
Actually, I was thinking of
someone who can sense Fae.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.495
It's worth a try.

22:10.997 --> 22:11.952
Whatever.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.962
Can I talk to you
for a minute? Privately?

22:22.175 --> 22:22.755
What's going on?

22:23.009 --> 22:23.919
You tell me.

22:24.177 --> 22:25.758
Dyson, I really don't
have the energy

22:26.012 --> 22:27.798
to play mind-reader
with you right now--

22:28.681 --> 22:30.637
--Bo.
--Ugh!

22:31.851 --> 22:34.263
--Don't--
--Wait. Please...

22:34.521 --> 22:35.431
Bo, you're bleeding.

22:35.688 --> 22:36.598
It's just a bruise.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.517
Internally!
This is serious.

22:38.775 --> 22:39.810
I'm fine.

22:40.860 --> 22:41.610
You could die.

22:41.861 --> 22:42.611
Aren't you feeding?

22:42.862 --> 22:43.237
Of course--

22:43.488 --> 22:44.773
On what,
a block of wood?

22:45.031 --> 22:45.781
I'm with Lauren.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.613
And?

22:47.867 --> 22:49.323
Only Lauren.

22:49.953 --> 22:51.614
Are you crazy?

22:51.871 --> 22:53.407
I am monogamous.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.829
No, you're a Succubus.

22:56.084 --> 22:58.450
You can't sustain yourself
on one human alone.

22:58.711 --> 22:59.575
You need to feed!

22:59.837 --> 23:01.623
No, I can't. I can't.

23:01.881 --> 23:02.336
I can't.

23:02.590 --> 23:03.545
Hey, hey--

23:04.884 --> 23:06.670
Look, there are
no strings here.

23:11.683 --> 23:13.469
It's either me
or an ambulance.

23:13.851 --> 23:14.931
I'm not kidding.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.976
No feelings.

23:51.014 --> 23:53.426
Hale! I just need
two seconds of your time.

23:54.183 --> 23:56.765
Oh! Sick outfit.
Very Gaga-esque.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.602
Ok, I got this Australian
wool and it is on sale,

23:59.856 --> 24:00.606
but only for today--

24:00.857 --> 24:01.937
This is not the time.

24:02.191 --> 24:03.931
If there's anything I've
learned from Tim Gunn,

24:04.193 --> 24:05.774
it's that it's always
time for fashion.

24:06.029 --> 24:06.609
[Gasp]

24:06.863 --> 24:09.400
[Thud, thud, thud]

24:10.033 --> 24:11.648
No!
Ambassador Brynhildr!

24:11.909 --> 24:12.864
Ambassador--

24:15.747 --> 24:17.328
We were in the
middle of something!

24:17.582 --> 24:19.447
Looked like a whole
lotta nothing to me.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.451
The Ambassador was
conferring with her ancestors!

24:22.712 --> 24:24.748
You mean like a conference
call with dead people?

24:25.006 --> 24:26.871
It requires silence.
Pure silence!

24:27.550 --> 24:28.881
How's a girl supposed
to know that?

24:29.135 --> 24:30.921
Just put a sock on
the door or something--

24:31.179 --> 24:33.511
This isn't Spring
Break in Cancun!

24:35.016 --> 24:39.055
My life hasn't exactly been
mojitos and sandy beaches.

24:41.564 --> 24:43.600
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.683
I gotta fix this mess.

24:59.874 --> 25:01.489
Mr. Dyson?
Are you all right?

25:03.544 --> 25:05.330
Kind of. Um...

25:06.547 --> 25:08.287
You know, I actually
think I do need

25:08.549 --> 25:09.584
a little help
emotionally, doc.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.924
[Cat hissing/meowing]

25:14.013 --> 25:14.468
Sorry about that.

25:14.722 --> 25:16.462
Dr. Bob is
usually so friendly.

25:16.724 --> 25:17.679
[Meowing]

25:19.018 --> 25:20.599
Must be my dogs.

25:20.853 --> 25:21.968
I have dogs.

25:22.855 --> 25:27.315
[Sniffing]

25:27.568 --> 25:28.648
Allergies?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.017
No.

25:30.279 --> 25:31.940
I smell layers,
um...

25:32.198 --> 25:34.985
Chemical compounds,
uh... hint of vanilla.

25:35.576 --> 25:37.953
Oh-- Oh, gosh,
is it the incense?

25:38.204 --> 25:39.489
The candles?

25:39.747 --> 25:40.827
The cat litter?

25:41.207 --> 25:42.617
[Sniffing]

25:42.875 --> 25:45.457
I must say, you have a
remarkable sense of smell.

25:45.712 --> 25:47.828
It's usually a little more
remarkable actually.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.957
Well--
Shall we begin?

25:53.720 --> 25:54.960
Sure.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.179
Your arms and
legs feel heavy.

26:05.231 --> 26:09.691
You slip deeper and
deeper into a relaxed state.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.857
Deeper and deeper.

26:15.074 --> 26:18.817
Now I want you
to reach way back

26:19.078 --> 26:21.114
into your
earliest childhood.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.621
Remember that time
of endless possibilities

26:24.876 --> 26:26.616
and idyllic dreams.

26:27.378 --> 26:29.994
I want you to think about
one of those dreams.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.003
Focus on it.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.881
Become it.

26:44.395 --> 26:45.805
DYSON:
It was amazing.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.803
I was grounded,
but like energized.

26:48.065 --> 26:50.807
It felt like I was given
a new lease on life.

26:51.068 --> 26:52.524
And a nick
on your neck.

26:52.779 --> 26:53.859
Yeah, it's just
shaving or something--

26:54.113 --> 26:55.978
During this session
you didn't smell Fae?

26:56.240 --> 26:57.776
At first I thought
I smelled something.

26:58.034 --> 27:00.025
But there was too
many scents in the air.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.743
There was incense and
candles and kitty litter.

27:02.997 --> 27:04.658
The diatomaceous
silica in the litter

27:04.916 --> 27:06.747
could have clouded
Dyson's senses.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.081
Seriously?

27:08.336 --> 27:10.247
Your kryptonite
is kitty litter?

27:11.881 --> 27:13.621
Palmer did put you
in a hypnotic trance.

27:13.883 --> 27:15.874
He could have convinced
you that he's not Fae.

27:16.135 --> 27:16.635
No.

27:16.886 --> 27:17.966
I remember
everything, Trick.

27:18.221 --> 27:19.085
[Phone ringing]

27:19.347 --> 27:21.884
He brought me back to my
earliest childhood memories.

27:25.228 --> 27:26.388
lt's Tamsin.

27:26.646 --> 27:27.726
There's another victim.

27:28.397 --> 27:29.307
And if Dyson
was with Palmer--

27:29.565 --> 27:32.807
Then it looks like Tabitha
could be our killer after all.

27:36.072 --> 27:36.686
TAMSIN: Well...

27:36.948 --> 27:38.609
Hate to say
I told you so.

27:38.866 --> 27:40.697
There's a lot of things
I'm sure you hate.

27:40.952 --> 27:42.817
That's not one of them.

27:43.079 --> 27:44.660
Okay,
the victim drowned.

27:44.914 --> 27:47.121
Witnesses say she dove into
the middle of the lake

27:47.375 --> 27:50.162
but apparently
could not swim.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.205
Are you okay?

27:52.463 --> 27:54.249
Yeah, yeah, just this
shirt's a little tight.

27:54.507 --> 27:55.963
Well, try
to keep it on?

27:58.052 --> 27:59.883
Some people
pulled her to shore.

28:04.934 --> 28:05.593
Hey, isn't that...

28:05.852 --> 28:06.807
Tabitha.

28:07.061 --> 28:08.972
Is that
a mermaid costume?

28:09.897 --> 28:12.434
Well, it looks like she's
not our killer after all.

28:12.692 --> 28:14.523
Told you so.

28:20.116 --> 28:21.231
So we have
a dead mermaid,

28:21.492 --> 28:22.732
a dead
tightrope walker,

28:22.994 --> 28:24.154
and an almost
dead superhero...

28:24.412 --> 28:25.447
Does anyone else
sense a pattern here?

28:25.705 --> 28:27.696
It's got to be Palmer,
our resident hypnotist.

28:27.957 --> 28:29.447
No, no,
the guy is not Fae.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.700
You said you couldn't
tell if he was Fae.

28:31.961 --> 28:33.371
Rakshasa.

28:33.629 --> 28:34.163
Bless you.

28:34.422 --> 28:37.880
No, Palmer might
be a Rakshasa.

28:38.134 --> 28:41.046
An Indonesian illusionist
and shapeshifter.

28:41.304 --> 28:43.465
It can only be
killed with lead.

28:43.723 --> 28:46.556
So, it would probably
be fairly easy for him

28:46.809 --> 28:48.765
to change his
form into say...

28:49.020 --> 28:49.884
a friendly therapist.

28:50.146 --> 28:52.683
And make people act out crazy
stunts that get them killed.

28:52.940 --> 28:55.397
People should be
allowed their dreams.

28:57.904 --> 29:00.111
[Phone ringing]

29:00.364 --> 29:01.740
Dal Riata.

29:02.658 --> 29:04.319
He did what?

29:05.703 --> 29:06.408
No.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.163
I'll take care of it.

29:09.415 --> 29:10.951
Excuse me.

29:12.543 --> 29:14.158
I say we go
question Palmer.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.285
--Right behind you.
--No, no!

29:16.547 --> 29:18.663
He's not gonna talk if we all
come down on him like this.

29:18.925 --> 29:19.914
You got
a better plan?

29:20.176 --> 29:22.633
Let me go, see if I can
sniff something out.

29:23.679 --> 29:25.294
Well, maybe I should
come with.

29:25.556 --> 29:28.593
It's better if I go alone.
Him and I have a rapport.

29:30.645 --> 29:33.682
[Phone ringing]
I don't know.

29:36.025 --> 29:37.856
Hey, Lauren...

29:38.110 --> 29:41.227
Yeah, sure, I can
come right over.

29:41.489 --> 29:44.572
There's something I
gotta talk to you about too.

29:47.703 --> 29:50.319
Ambassador Brynhildr only
comes out of her turret

29:50.581 --> 29:52.913
once every four months.

29:53.167 --> 29:55.408
We cannot let her leave
without approval

29:55.670 --> 30:00.255
from her ancestors about the
Dyson/Tamsin trial program!

30:00.508 --> 30:02.749
What the hell happened?

30:03.010 --> 30:05.672
We were interrupted.
It's not that big a deal.

30:05.930 --> 30:08.342
You know how Kenzi just
bursts in on things--

30:08.599 --> 30:09.759
Kenzi?!

30:10.017 --> 30:11.302
What was Kenzi
doing here

30:11.560 --> 30:14.893
during such an
important engagement?

30:15.147 --> 30:16.398
She's my--

30:16.649 --> 30:17.684
[Under breath]
--stylist.

30:17.942 --> 30:19.728
What was that?

30:20.152 --> 30:21.107
[Sigh]

30:21.362 --> 30:23.819
She's my stylist. I told her
she could be my stylist.

30:24.073 --> 30:27.190
You are The Ash now.

30:27.451 --> 30:29.362
And not quite the horse
everyone's betting on.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.952
Oh, whoa, look--
I'm tired of taking it

30:32.206 --> 30:33.787
in the nads every time
I turn around here.

30:34.041 --> 30:36.373
Well, you wanted
to make a difference.

30:36.627 --> 30:38.834
So, here's your chance.

30:39.088 --> 30:41.955
But that means protecting
the inner workings

30:42.216 --> 30:44.582
of this office!
And your people!

30:44.844 --> 30:46.800
It's just Kenzi.
Come on.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.591
We all love Kenzi.

30:49.849 --> 30:51.931
But make no mistake...

30:52.184 --> 30:53.765
she's not one of us.

30:55.730 --> 30:56.970
That's harsh.

30:57.231 --> 30:59.563
Nobody said
this would be easy.

31:01.110 --> 31:02.020
So what do I do?

31:02.278 --> 31:04.394
You step up.

31:04.655 --> 31:07.317
You do what
you have to do.

31:07.575 --> 31:10.692
Even if it's more
than you can bear.

31:17.168 --> 31:17.998
Lauren, hey.

31:18.252 --> 31:19.367
Hey.

31:19.837 --> 31:22.123
I need to talk to you
about something.

31:23.966 --> 31:26.582
It's, uh, going to be
hard to hear--

31:26.844 --> 31:28.004
Come. Look...

31:28.262 --> 31:30.548
I've been pouring over the
photos you brought me:

31:30.806 --> 31:32.262
Tabitha,
the tightrope walker--

31:32.516 --> 31:34.131
Okay.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.348
Look here.

31:36.937 --> 31:38.393
And here.

31:38.647 --> 31:39.898
They have
the same wound.

31:40.149 --> 31:42.185
That continues to
bleed after rigor mortis.

31:42.443 --> 31:43.603
Well, that's not
possible, is it?

31:43.861 --> 31:44.520
No.

31:44.779 --> 31:46.895
I think that's how the
Fae enters the victims

31:47.156 --> 31:49.613
and how it continues
to feed off them.

31:49.867 --> 31:52.233
--You know what I'm thinking?
--Dyson.

31:52.495 --> 31:54.076
That's not exactly
where I was going.

31:54.330 --> 31:56.366
Palmer must
be the Rakshasa.

31:56.624 --> 31:59.036
He hypnotizes his patients
into acting out childhood

31:59.293 --> 32:02.000
fantasies then feeds off their
adrenaline until they die.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.165
Dyson was hypnotized.
He has the same wound.

32:05.674 --> 32:07.289
[Phone ringing]

32:07.551 --> 32:08.131
What's up?

32:08.385 --> 32:09.670
Dyson never made it
back to the cop shop.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.169
I can't reach
him on his cell.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.294
Meet me
at the clinic.

32:12.556 --> 32:14.012
I'm already on my way,
sweetheart.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.052
I'll talk
to you later.

32:18.145 --> 32:19.646
I don't know how
you did it, doc,

32:19.897 --> 32:21.888
but you made me
see the truth.

32:22.149 --> 32:25.141
You've made me see that
I've been living a lie.

32:25.402 --> 32:27.563
For years!

32:27.822 --> 32:29.437
For hundreds
of years.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.199
Hundreds?

32:31.450 --> 32:32.485
I made a wrong
turn somewhere,

32:32.743 --> 32:35.200
but I can change that.
I can see that.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.694
I can go back now.

32:36.956 --> 32:37.695
I see that--
I can go back!

32:37.957 --> 32:39.367
Please--
put that down.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.412
Doc--
You can help me.

32:42.670 --> 32:43.125
I'm ready.

32:43.379 --> 32:47.167
I am ready to be what
I was meant to be.

32:49.969 --> 32:53.507
What is it with
people and daggers?

32:53.764 --> 32:55.049
They're very
convincing.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.843
Unlike you, which is
strange considering

32:57.101 --> 32:59.012
you hypnotize people into
killing themselves.

32:59.270 --> 33:00.885
I don't. I swear.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.683
We know you're
a Rakshasa.

33:02.940 --> 33:04.225
A what?

33:04.483 --> 33:06.269
Look, I'm just
some guy who took

33:06.527 --> 33:09.018
a couple of internet
courses on hypnosis.

33:09.280 --> 33:12.113
I don't even know what
the hell I'm really doing.

33:14.076 --> 33:19.070
Come on, Dr. Palmer,
you're really not Fae?

33:19.331 --> 33:21.037
" Fae" ?

33:21.292 --> 33:21.997
Oh, great.

33:22.251 --> 33:24.367
I shouldn't even
be practicing.

33:24.628 --> 33:28.792
I don't help people, and
all of my patients end up dead.

33:29.049 --> 33:30.835
Dyson's out there with
a monster on his tail

33:31.093 --> 33:33.004
and all we've got to
go on is Dr. Dipshit.

33:33.262 --> 33:34.297
Did he say
anything else?

33:34.555 --> 33:35.635
Anything at all?

33:35.890 --> 33:36.970
Ranting mostly.

33:37.224 --> 33:38.555
About being the
King of creatures.

33:38.809 --> 33:41.141
Wanting to fly.

33:41.395 --> 33:43.477
The roof--

33:44.773 --> 33:48.140
You didn't leave the
door open, did you?

33:48.402 --> 33:51.485
Dr. Bob has a
tendency to escape.

33:51.739 --> 33:53.821
Dr. Bob...

34:05.044 --> 34:07.410
Hey... buddy.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.002
Whadaya say
we go to the Dal,

34:09.256 --> 34:10.996
grab a couple fingers
of the good stuff.

34:11.258 --> 34:14.216
I'm not going
back there!

34:14.470 --> 34:16.961
Okay, um, look, if you're
depressed or something--

34:17.223 --> 34:20.761
I'm happier than
I've ever been.

34:21.018 --> 34:24.476
I had a dream once.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.971
And I'm going to make
that dream come true.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.814
Jeez, if you wanted
to sleep with me,

34:29.068 --> 34:31.275
you didn't have to get on a
ledge to get my attention.

34:31.528 --> 34:35.942
l was born into a family
of shapeshifters.

34:36.200 --> 34:37.940
But I was meant
to be a Griffin.

34:38.202 --> 34:39.112
Okay, I'm
warning you--

34:39.370 --> 34:40.655
Do not unwrap
the wang.

34:40.913 --> 34:43.279
I can't be
grounded anymore!

34:43.540 --> 34:45.280
I need to fly.

34:45.542 --> 34:48.033
I need to be free.

34:49.004 --> 34:51.746
Where's Dr. Bob?!

34:52.007 --> 34:52.962
Thank goodness
you're here.

34:53.217 --> 34:54.582
I am so bad
at this shit.

34:54.843 --> 34:55.252
The cat--

34:55.511 --> 34:56.842
Have you seen
Palmer's cat?

34:57.096 --> 34:58.131
Forget the cat.

34:58.389 --> 34:59.469
You talk Manimal
down over here

34:59.723 --> 35:00.758
and I'll go
after Rakshasa.

35:01.016 --> 35:02.267
Dr. Bob is
the Rakshasa.

35:02.518 --> 35:03.974
He feeds off the adrenaline
rush of his victims

35:04.228 --> 35:05.593
when they live out
their childhood dream.

35:05.854 --> 35:08.345
You've got your work cut out
for you, because this one

35:08.607 --> 35:10.939
wants to be half lion, half
eagle and full asshole.

35:11.193 --> 35:12.478
Here, kitty-kitty--

35:12.736 --> 35:14.988
Dyson!

35:15.239 --> 35:16.945
Bo.

35:17.199 --> 35:20.066
I'm so glad you're here
to see my transformation.

35:20.327 --> 35:22.033
Into a Griffin?

35:22.288 --> 35:23.368
I grew up hearing
about them.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.204
A creature of strength
and magnificence!

35:26.458 --> 35:28.619
I wanted to be
them so badly.

35:28.877 --> 35:31.835
You are strong
and magnificent.

35:32.089 --> 35:34.501
You are a wolf.

35:34.758 --> 35:37.500
Loved by
so many people.

35:37.761 --> 35:39.922
Not by you.

35:41.515 --> 35:43.301
I got it!

35:43.559 --> 35:44.890
How do I kill
this thing again?

35:45.144 --> 35:47.351
With lead!

35:54.570 --> 35:55.935
Um...

35:56.864 --> 35:58.775
How much lead
are we talking here?

35:59.033 --> 35:59.897
Dyson...

36:00.159 --> 36:02.070
You are the wolf.

36:02.328 --> 36:06.822
Strong, fast, fierce.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.822
But my dream.

36:09.084 --> 36:12.542
It was the
dream of a child.

36:12.796 --> 36:17.711
Your wolf is the
dream of a man.

36:17.968 --> 36:20.926
A man that we all love.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.345
Come on.

36:39.198 --> 36:41.814
[Rawr]
Tamsin! Watch out!

36:42.076 --> 36:44.283
Don't worry your
pretty little head.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.447
I got this.

36:48.207 --> 36:50.072
This should do it.

36:55.339 --> 36:58.081
[Monster screeching]

37:05.682 --> 37:06.341
All right.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.682
Let's get tanked.

37:09.978 --> 37:12.105
Come on.

37:13.607 --> 37:15.188
How you holding up?

37:15.442 --> 37:17.603
Well, I'm gonna be avoiding
rooftops for a while,

37:17.861 --> 37:18.691
you can count on that.

37:18.946 --> 37:21.062
[Laughing]

37:21.323 --> 37:23.188
But this whole thing,
it's made me realize

37:23.450 --> 37:25.691
that I have been
neglecting my wolf.

37:25.953 --> 37:27.989
So, more howling
at the moon then?

37:28.247 --> 37:30.158
More of everything.

37:32.709 --> 37:35.200
And how are you?

37:35.462 --> 37:37.418
I am good as new.

37:41.718 --> 37:44.551
Dyson, what
happened between us...

37:44.805 --> 37:47.296
it can't happen again.

37:48.851 --> 37:50.011
You can't survive
off of Lauren alone.

37:50.269 --> 37:53.102
And I will talk to her
about that, but--

37:53.355 --> 37:57.348
you and me...
with our history...

37:57.609 --> 38:02.194
I mean, obviously you can't
feel anything anymore, but...

38:02.448 --> 38:04.689
It's still hurtful--

38:04.950 --> 38:06.360
To Lauren.

38:09.830 --> 38:13.789
You understand... right?

38:17.713 --> 38:19.795
Of course I do.

38:21.008 --> 38:22.418
I knew you would.

38:23.385 --> 38:24.340
Cheers.

38:24.595 --> 38:26.335
Cheers.

38:43.322 --> 38:44.778
Damn.

38:45.032 --> 38:47.523
That girl really
gets to you, huh?

38:48.911 --> 38:50.492
I'll tell you what--

38:50.746 --> 38:52.486
How about I buy
us a pitcher

38:52.748 --> 38:56.457
and you can tell me
all about it. 'Kay?

38:56.710 --> 38:57.916
Nope.

38:58.170 --> 39:01.662
So, what, you're just going
to sit here brooding?

39:01.924 --> 39:02.754
No.

39:02.841 --> 39:03.421
We're going out.

39:03.425 --> 39:05.336
And we're going to
tear this town apart.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.005
I know just
the place.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.345
Except it might be
a little rough

39:10.599 --> 39:13.682
for a delicate flower
such as yourself.

39:13.936 --> 39:16.848
But the women are hot
and the drinks are cold.

39:17.105 --> 39:18.481
Sounds perfect.
You buying?

39:18.732 --> 39:21.599
Only if you're
a good little boy.

39:21.860 --> 39:22.815
Are you?

39:23.070 --> 39:24.276
No.

39:24.530 --> 39:27.613
I'm a very,
very bad wolf.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.572
Good answer.

39:29.826 --> 39:31.407
Let's go.

39:41.755 --> 39:43.916
Uh... you must
be new here.

39:44.174 --> 39:45.129
Let me
introduce myself.

39:45.384 --> 39:47.295
My name is Kenzi.

39:47.553 --> 39:49.214
Stylist
extraordinnaire

39:49.471 --> 39:52.178
and besties
with The Ash.

39:53.100 --> 39:53.885
Dude"

39:54.142 --> 39:56.884
Stop Ash-blocking the Kenz.

40:01.608 --> 40:02.723
Hey.

40:13.620 --> 40:15.121
Hale, please--
I need to talk to you!

40:15.372 --> 40:18.159
It's serious!
Some shit got spilled on me!

40:22.129 --> 40:24.165
Dyson should come see
me as soon as he can.

40:24.423 --> 40:24.878
I want to make sure

40:25.132 --> 40:27.999
the Rakshasa's wound
heals properly.

40:29.303 --> 40:31.885
There's no need.

40:32.139 --> 40:33.800
All better now.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.763
Well, there's
only a few things

40:36.018 --> 40:39.101
that can heal
a Rakshasa's wound and...

40:44.860 --> 40:49.194
Lauren,
I am so so sorry.

40:49.448 --> 40:52.611
I was bleeding
internally.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.990
Wow.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.990
And here I thought you were just
playing at being a doctor.

41:01.251 --> 41:04.118
I wasn't healing
and he was there.

41:04.379 --> 41:06.961
And there were
no feelings for anyone.

41:07.215 --> 41:08.546
And I regretted
it immediately.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.210
And I should have come
and talked to you.

41:10.469 --> 41:13.461
And please,
say something.

41:27.778 --> 41:29.393
If this is you angry,
I need to tell you

41:29.655 --> 41:30.735
about the time I borrowed
your favourite pair

41:30.989 --> 41:33.696
of earrings and
lost one of them.

41:36.078 --> 41:39.241
I love you.

41:39.498 --> 41:41.864
I love you too.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.161
But being a doctor, I know
I'm not enough for you.

41:44.419 --> 41:46.671
No, don't say that.

41:46.922 --> 41:49.254
YouWe
a Succubus, Bo.

41:49.508 --> 41:52.591
And we both tried to pretend
that it wouldn't be an issue,

41:52.844 --> 41:54.630
but it is.

41:54.888 --> 41:59.678
And for some reason, the shots
aren't working anymore, and--

42:00.769 --> 42:02.725
So...?

42:04.398 --> 42:06.559
So--

42:07.526 --> 42:11.690
You have to start
feeding... off others.

42:11.947 --> 42:14.313
And you're
okay with that?

42:16.535 --> 42:20.027
[Laughing]

42:21.373 --> 42:22.738
I have to be.

42:24.626 --> 42:28.084
But, I think
that we should...

42:28.338 --> 42:30.499
...make some
ground rules.

42:30.757 --> 42:32.372
Of course.

42:32.634 --> 42:34.135
Anything.

42:34.386 --> 42:36.342
For starters...

42:39.558 --> 42:41.674
No Dyson.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.852
I promise.

42:57.576 --> 42:59.282
I promise.

43:04.541 --> 43:05.291
Bo.

43:05.542 --> 43:07.749
Bo, please call me back.
Like ASAP--

43:08.003 --> 43:12.121
I'm just-- I'm really
freaking out, okay?

43:20.098 --> 43:20.962
What are you?

43:21.224 --> 43:23.806
And why won't
you go away?

43:30.942 --> 43:32.022
[Thud]

43:32.277 --> 43:33.778
[Snarling]
