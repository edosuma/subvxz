06:29.457 --> 06:31.024
DREW STARTED ACTING JEALOUS

06:31.024 --> 06:32.292
AND CRAZY.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.194
DREW INSULTED SHAUN FOR NO

06:34.194 --> 06:36.129
REASON THE FIRST TIME THEY MET,

06:36.129 --> 06:37.164
AND THEN HE TRIED TO KISS ME

06:37.164 --> 06:38.331
LIKE A LUNATIC.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.267
I INVITED YOU GUYS OUT

06:40.267 --> 06:43.070
TO APOLOGIZE AND TO KIND OF GET

06:43.070 --> 06:45.573
TO KNOW YOU A LITTLE BIT, 'CAUSE

06:45.573 --> 06:47.074
YOU GUYS OBVIOUSLY ARE

06:47.074 --> 06:47.875
IN EACH OTHER'S LIFE,

06:47.875 --> 06:50.277
IN A RELATIONSHIP, RIGHT?

06:50.277 --> 06:51.612
IS THAT--

06:51.612 --> 06:52.480
SERIOUSLY?

06:52.480 --> 06:53.714
YES, WE ARE TOGETHER.

06:53.714 --> 06:54.381
OKAY.

06:54.381 --> 06:55.583
DO YOU FEEL THREATENED BY ME?

06:55.583 --> 06:56.984
OH, MY GOD!

06:56.984 --> 06:58.051
[laughs]

06:58.051 --> 06:59.587
OH, MY GOD.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.154
NOT AT ALL.

07:01.154 --> 07:01.822
OKAY.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.491
WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS

07:03.491 --> 07:04.124
WITH TRACI?

07:04.124 --> 07:05.392
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA, YOU KNOW,

07:05.392 --> 07:06.594
ESTABLISH INTENTIONS, 'CAUSE

07:06.594 --> 07:07.394
RIGHT NOW, EVERYTHING'S

07:07.394 --> 07:08.496
GOING GREAT.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.097
WE JUST LETTING IT FLOW.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.064
OKAY.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.166
"LETTING IT FLOW."

07:13.166 --> 07:15.035
SO I BROUGHT A LITTLE

07:15.035 --> 07:15.736
QUESTIONNAIRE.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.737
SERIOUSLY?

07:16.737 --> 07:17.905
LET HIM DO HIS THING.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.507
THIS IS GOING NOWHERE.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.508
THIS IS GOING GREAT.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.241
GOT, LIKE, 30 QUESTIONS

07:21.241 --> 07:21.909
ON THAT SHEET.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.511
"ARE THERE ANY SECRETS THAT

07:23.511 --> 07:25.913
CAN POSSIBLY LATER COME OUT?"

07:25.913 --> 07:27.014
THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION.

07:27.014 --> 07:27.881
I'LL LET YOU GIVE.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.750
I GOT A CLEAN SLATE.

07:29.750 --> 07:30.951
SO YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO JAIL.

07:30.951 --> 07:31.952
NO EXES THAT ARE GONNA BE--

07:31.952 --> 07:33.754
I AIN'T GOT NO WORRIES.

07:33.754 --> 07:34.855
HAVE YOU EVER STOLEN

07:34.855 --> 07:35.523
ANYTHING?

07:35.523 --> 07:37.224
NO WORRIES. NO PROBLEMS.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.091
NO PROBLEMS.

07:38.091 --> 07:38.759
NONE.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.193
NO CRIMINAL RECORDS.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.529
MAN, I'M A1 GOOD, HOMEY.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.863
A1 GOOD.

07:42.863 --> 07:43.697
HMM.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.065
I DID SOME INVESTIGATION.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.300
I GOOGLED A LITTLE BIT,

07:47.300 --> 07:48.569
AND YOU DON'T LOOK TOO HAPPY

07:48.569 --> 07:49.269
IN THIS MUG SHOT

07:49.269 --> 07:52.640
THAT I'M FINDING IN 2006.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.306
YOU SEE IT, RIGHT?

07:53.306 --> 07:56.009
IT'S A MUG SHOT.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.110
SEEMS LIKE YOUR LITTLE BABY

07:57.110 --> 07:58.011
DADDY'S SCARED OF ME.

07:58.011 --> 07:58.846
FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT SCARED

07:58.846 --> 08:00.080
OF NO MAN IN THE WORLD.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.181
"THEFT BY TAKING,"

08:01.181 --> 08:02.382
WHICH MEANS WHAT?

08:02.382 --> 08:04.117
YOU TOOK SOMEONE'S SOMETHING.

08:04.117 --> 08:04.985
WHAT DID YOU TAKE?

08:04.985 --> 08:05.886
WAIT, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

08:05.886 --> 08:06.820
IS THIS REAL?

08:06.820 --> 08:08.188
IT'S OLD NEWS.

08:08.188 --> 08:08.856
BUT IT'S REAL?

08:08.856 --> 08:09.557
BUT YOU JUST SAID--

08:09.557 --> 08:10.257
IT'S OLD NEWS.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.626
I DO RECALL YOU JUST SAYING

08:12.626 --> 08:13.894
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO JAIL.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.095
I DIDN'T GO IN NO CELL.

08:15.095 --> 08:15.996
I WENT IN, I WENT OUT.

08:15.996 --> 08:16.897
I SHOWED UP, AND I DIDN'T EVEN

08:16.897 --> 08:17.998
GO IN THE PRISON, SO DON'T EVEN

08:17.998 --> 08:18.999
GO THERE, HOMEY.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.433
JUST WHEN I STARTED TO TRUST

08:20.433 --> 08:22.202
THIS DUDE AND THINK THAT I COULD

08:22.202 --> 08:24.071
BRING MY SON AROUND HIM, I FIND

08:24.071 --> 08:25.438
OUT HE HAS A CRIMINAL RECORD?

08:25.438 --> 08:26.707
WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION

08:26.707 --> 08:27.775
NUMEROUS TIMES.

08:27.775 --> 08:28.809
IF SOMEBODY WOULD LIE

08:28.809 --> 08:30.077
OVER SOMETHING SO SMALL,

08:30.077 --> 08:31.311
HOW DO I TRUST HIM?

08:31.311 --> 08:32.479
YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THAT.

08:32.479 --> 08:33.313
YEAH, WE TALKED ABOUT THAT,

08:33.313 --> 08:34.582
BUT RIGHT NOW, WITH THE WAY YOUR

08:34.582 --> 08:35.816
BABY DADDY'S COMING UP, I'M NOT

08:35.816 --> 08:36.784
GONNA SIT THERE AND GIVE HIM--

08:36.784 --> 08:37.951
SON'S FATHER.

08:37.951 --> 08:38.986
STOP!

08:38.986 --> 08:40.988
I'M JUST EATING SOME TUNA.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.658
NEXT QUESTION.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.660
EVERYBODY HAVE A GOOD DAY.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.465
I ASKED YOU, "SHOULD I TRUST

08:52.465 --> 08:53.867
YOU?" AND THEN YOU SAT

08:53.867 --> 08:56.269
AT THE TABLE, AND YOU LIED.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.270
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT

08:57.270 --> 08:58.505
IS DIVORCE.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.741
TALK TO YOUR WIFE.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.677
TRY TO FIX THIS.

09:03.677 --> 09:04.845
SHE'S MAD 'CAUSE SHE'S OLD.

09:04.845 --> 09:05.679
IT AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO DO

09:05.679 --> 09:06.346
WITH ME.

09:06.346 --> 09:07.047
I THOUGHT WE SAID WE WAS

09:07.047 --> 09:07.948
GONNA PUT IT IN THE PAST.

09:07.948 --> 09:08.749
OKAY, SO WHAT YOU GONNA DO

09:08.749 --> 09:10.751
IF WE DON'T?

09:19.927 --> 09:20.761
TRACI.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.662
ONE THING YOU NEED TO KNOW

09:21.662 --> 09:23.931
ABOUT ME IS THAT I HAVE A ZERO

09:23.931 --> 09:26.767
TOLERANCE POLICY FOR LIARS.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.001
INCIDENT HAPPENED IN 2006,

09:28.001 --> 09:30.003
BEFORE I EVEN GOT IN MY CAREER

09:30.003 --> 09:30.938
AND WHAT I'M DOING NOW.

09:30.938 --> 09:31.839
INDIVIDUAL TOOK SOMETHING

09:31.839 --> 09:32.505
FROM ME.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.173
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.041
OKAY, I ADMIT IT, I LIED,

09:34.041 --> 09:35.342
AND I APOLOGIZE.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.309
I SAID TO YOU,

09:36.309 --> 09:37.945
"CAN I TRUST YOU?"

09:37.945 --> 09:39.146
YOU CAN TRUST ME.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.413
BUT YOU KEEPING SECRETS.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.749
YOU SIT IN FRONT OF DREW,

09:41.749 --> 09:42.549
AND YOU WOULD LIE.

09:42.549 --> 09:43.651
I DON'T EVEN FEEL YOUR BABY

09:43.651 --> 09:44.685
DADDY LIKE THAT, SO RIGHT NOW,

09:44.685 --> 09:45.385
I'M NOT GONNA GIVE HIM

09:45.385 --> 09:46.486
THE UPPER HAND AND--

09:46.486 --> 09:47.487
IT'S NOT ABOUT UPPER HAND.

09:47.487 --> 09:48.388
IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT HIM.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.790
IT'S ABOUT BEING HONEST

09:49.790 --> 09:51.491
AND ABOUT TELLING THE TRUTH.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.726
BUT I NEVER GOT PUT IN CUFFS.

09:52.726 --> 09:53.827
I HAD TO TURN MYSELF IN

09:53.827 --> 09:54.862
FOR WHAT I DID.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.163
I WAS 22. I WAS WILD.

09:56.163 --> 09:56.964
I WAS RECKLESS.

09:56.964 --> 09:57.865
I DIDN'T GIVE A [bleep]

09:57.865 --> 09:58.866
ABOUT LIFE BACK THEN.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.233
I WAS JUST--I WAS YOUNG, DUMB,

10:00.233 --> 10:01.468
AND JUST HAVING FUN.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.235
WHAT ARE YOU NOW?

10:02.235 --> 10:03.036
RIGHT NOW, I'M GROWN.

10:03.036 --> 10:03.737
I'M ABOUT A CAREER.

10:03.737 --> 10:04.404
I'M ABOUT A LIFE.

10:04.404 --> 10:05.072
LIKE, I LIKE YOU.

10:05.072 --> 10:05.839
I'M TRYING TO, YOU KNOW,

10:05.839 --> 10:07.140

10:07.140 --> 10:07.875
LIKE, YES, I ADMIT IT,

10:07.875 --> 10:09.409
I WAS WRONG, BUT IT WASN'T--

10:09.409 --> 10:10.210
THAT WASN'T THE RIGHT TIME

10:10.210 --> 10:11.344
FOR ME TO SIT THERE AND ADMIT--

10:11.344 --> 10:12.680
"SO YOU NEVER BEEN ARRESTED?"

10:12.680 --> 10:13.613
IT'S NOT ABOUT HIM!

10:13.613 --> 10:14.281
I DON'T KNOW--

10:14.281 --> 10:15.148
IT'S ABOUT ME!

10:15.148 --> 10:15.949
THIS IS A PERFECT TIME

10:15.949 --> 10:16.984
FOR YOU TO BE HONEST.

10:16.984 --> 10:17.751
SO I'M NOT FIXING TO SIT--

10:17.751 --> 10:18.451
I ASKED YOU,

10:18.451 --> 10:19.720
"SHOULD I TRUST YOU?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.021
CAN I TRUST YOU?"

10:21.021 --> 10:22.022
AND THEN YOU SAT AT THE TABLE,

10:22.022 --> 10:23.456
AND YOU LIED.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.458
SO I CANNOT TRUST YOU!

10:27.160 --> 10:28.628
SO YOU'RE GONNA GO YOUR WAY,

10:28.628 --> 10:29.529
I'M GONNA GO MINE,

10:29.529 --> 10:31.198
AND EVERYBODY'S GONNA BE HAPPY.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.499
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, I'M GONNA

10:32.499 --> 10:33.533
RESPECT YOUR CHOICE, BOO.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.535

10:49.482 --> 10:50.517
THAT IS SMELLING AWESOME.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.085
THIS IS ORIGINAL, OKAY?

10:52.085 --> 10:53.053
AIN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE

10:53.053 --> 10:54.888
RESTING RIGHT NOW, MAN?

10:54.888 --> 10:56.824
WELL, YOU KNOW,

10:56.824 --> 10:58.759
THERE'S NO REST FOR THE WEARY.

10:58.759 --> 10:59.693
YOU KNOW, MY DAD'S

10:59.693 --> 11:00.460
MY BEST FRIEND.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.962
HE'S A NUMBER ONE GOOD GUY,

11:01.962 --> 11:02.730
YOU KNOW, AND I HEARD FROM MY

11:02.730 --> 11:03.931
BROTHERS AND SISTERS THAT HE WAS

11:03.931 --> 11:05.766
HAVING SOME PROSTATE PROBLEMS,

11:05.766 --> 11:06.900
SO, YOU KNOW, I HAD TO GET HIM A

11:06.900 --> 11:08.635
CRIB IN ATLANTA JUST SO I COULD

11:08.635 --> 11:09.937
KEEP A EYE ON HIM

11:09.937 --> 11:10.871
AND, YOU KNOW, SPEND A LITTLE

11:10.871 --> 11:12.439
MORE TIME WITH HIM.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.875

11:17.510 --> 11:18.746

11:18.746 --> 11:20.380
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP

11:20.380 --> 11:21.815
UP WITH YOU SOMETIMES.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.150
I HEAR YOU, POP.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.451
I'M WORKING ON IT.

11:24.451 --> 11:25.452
YOU'RE WORKING ON IT?

11:25.452 --> 11:26.386
I'M WORKING ON IT.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.120
[laughter]

11:27.120 --> 11:28.255
HEY, GUYS.

I LOVE YOU MORE.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.297
I REALLY LOVE STEVIE'S DAD,

11:37.297 --> 11:38.431
AND I LOVE TO SEE STEVIE AND HIS

11:38.431 --> 11:39.900
POPS TOGETHER, BECAUSE HE REALLY

11:39.900 --> 11:42.435

11:42.435 --> 11:43.771
AND THAT'S WHY IT MAKES ME WANT

11:43.771 --> 11:44.504
TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE

11:44.504 --> 11:45.172
WITH HIM.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.073
WHAT Y'ALL WAS TALKING ABOUT

11:46.073 --> 11:47.240
BEFORE I WALKED IN?

11:47.240 --> 11:48.308

11:48.308 --> 11:49.342
ABOUT SOMETHING, POPS.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.978
I WAS TRYING TO TELL MY SON,

11:50.978 --> 11:52.345
YOU KNOW, THAT HE GOT TO MAKE

11:52.345 --> 11:53.546
A CHOICE.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.215
HE NEEDS TO MAKE A CHOICE.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.383
NOT THAT HE HAS TO.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.086
HE NEEDS A STRONG WOMAN

11:59.086 --> 12:00.453
BEHIND HIM, POPS.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.955
OF COURSE I DO.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.023
YOU'RE A STRONG WOMAN.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.792
I KNOW I'M A STRONG WOMAN,

12:04.792 --> 12:05.793
AND I KNOW I'M THE WOMAN

12:05.793 --> 12:07.494
THAT HE NEEDS, BUT HE PLAY

12:07.494 --> 12:08.161
TOO MANY GAMES.

12:08.161 --> 12:08.962
WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT

12:08.962 --> 12:09.629
OUT OF LIFE?

12:09.629 --> 12:12.499

12:17.938 --> 12:19.072
MARRIAGE, RIGHT?

12:19.072 --> 12:19.940

12:33.653 --> 12:35.122
BUT, YOU KNOW,

12:35.122 --> 12:36.623
COMMITTING FOREVER?

12:36.623 --> 12:37.524
I DON'T THINK I'M READY

12:37.524 --> 12:38.959
TO JUMP THE BROOM YET.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.093
I HAVE THE HIGHEST REGARD

12:40.093 --> 12:41.294
AND HIGHEST RESPECT FOR YOU.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.830
BUT IF I'M WILLING TO DROP

12:42.830 --> 12:44.397
EVERYTHING AND SAY, "LET'S JUST

12:44.397 --> 12:45.298
DO IT AND BE TOGETHER AND MAKE

12:45.298 --> 12:46.666

12:46.666 --> 12:47.835
DO THE SAME?

12:47.835 --> 12:49.536
WELL, YOU GOT TO PRESS HIM.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.437
I DO PRESS HIM.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.538
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.941
TELL HIM YOU'RE GOING TO VEGAS.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.108
GET HIM DRUNK.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.944

GET HIM DRUNK!

12:58.145 --> 12:59.512
YOU KNOW, POPS--

12:59.512 --> 13:01.481
HE KNOWS HOW HIS SON OPERATES.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.016
HE'S A VERY SMART MAN.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.251
IF HE THINKS I SHOULD GIVE HIM

13:04.251 --> 13:05.618
A LITTLE PUSH, THAT'S EXACTLY

13:05.618 --> 13:06.887
WHAT I NEED TO DO.

13:06.887 --> 13:07.687
YOU WANT TO BLESS THE FOOD,

13:07.687 --> 13:08.355

13:13.861 --> 13:14.661

13:17.630 --> 13:18.899

13:24.071 --> 13:25.605
[doorbell rings]

13:25.605 --> 13:26.306

13:31.178 --> 13:33.914

13:33.914 --> 13:35.415
I'VE KNOWN MIMI LONGER THAN

13:35.415 --> 13:36.950
I'VE KNOWN RASHEEDA, SO WHEN SHE

13:36.950 --> 13:38.085
CALLED ME, I KIND OF KNEW

13:38.085 --> 13:39.352
EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS ABOUT.

13:39.352 --> 13:40.954
IT'S DEFINITELY FINE WITH ME,

13:40.954 --> 13:41.621
'CAUSE I WANT TO TALK

13:41.621 --> 13:42.622
TO SOMEBODY WHO NOT GONNA

13:42.622 --> 13:44.324
YELL AT ME OR ARGUE.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.193
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.560
I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.897
I WANT TO HEAR

13:49.897 --> 13:51.131
YOUR SIDE OF THINGS.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.399
I SPOKE TO RASHEEDA.

13:52.399 --> 13:54.234
JUST, WHAT--

13:54.234 --> 13:55.468
WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?

13:55.468 --> 13:56.136
SHE FILLED YOU IN

13:56.136 --> 13:58.205
ON WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:58.205 --> 13:59.172
YES.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.140
I DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW HOW

14:00.140 --> 14:01.241
IT GOT TO WHERE IT'S AT.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.275
LIKE, I DON'T EVEN HAVE, LIKE,

14:02.275 --> 14:03.510
A STRAIGHT ANSWER, LIKE,

14:03.510 --> 14:05.145
"ME AND YOU GOT HERE, RASHEEDA,

14:05.145 --> 14:07.214
BECAUSE THIS," BUT, I MEAN,

14:07.214 --> 14:08.916
I FELT LIKE IT'S JUST,

14:08.916 --> 14:13.220
OVER TIME, SHE WASN'T REALLY

14:13.220 --> 14:15.022
MAKING ME FEEL APPRECIATED.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.789
SHE JUST AIN'T CARING ABOUT ME,

14:16.789 --> 14:18.625
AND I'M NOT GETTING ATTENTION,

14:18.625 --> 14:19.659
AND I'M JUST BEING HONEST,

14:19.659 --> 14:21.661
AND I'M JUST LOOKING LIKE...

14:23.396 --> 14:24.364
IF SHE'S SAYING, "GET THE

14:24.364 --> 14:25.498

14:25.498 --> 14:26.599

14:28.668 --> 14:30.037
KIRK.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.404
[bangs on counter]

14:31.404 --> 14:32.772
I MEAN, I'MA BE HONEST.

14:32.772 --> 14:34.807
THAT PART ABOUT IT--

14:34.807 --> 14:36.409
I'MA SAY THIS:

14:36.409 --> 14:37.945
I MAY BE WRONG FOR IT,

14:37.945 --> 14:39.846
AND I AM WRONG FOR IT--

14:39.846 --> 14:43.216
DO YOU THINK HER NOT SHOWING

14:43.216 --> 14:44.817
YOU THIS ATTENTION IS WORTH

14:44.817 --> 14:46.286
BREAKING UP YOUR MARRIAGE

14:46.286 --> 14:49.756
AND YOUR FAMILY?

14:49.756 --> 14:51.658
ARE YOU WILLING AND PREPARED

14:51.658 --> 14:54.094
TO FIX THIS, OR ARE YOU HAVING

14:54.094 --> 14:55.795
JUST TOO MUCH FUN?

14:55.795 --> 14:58.065
I'M GONNA SMILE, BECAUSE,

14:58.065 --> 15:00.633
YES, I DID HAVE FUN.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.135
WHY IS IT THAT A MAN WILL

15:02.135 --> 15:03.971
RISK EVERYTHING--HIS WOMAN,

15:03.971 --> 15:07.240
HIS FAMILY--FOR A LOUSY, $2 HO?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.276
NOT ONLY HAS KIRK BROKEN HIS

15:09.276 --> 15:11.044
VOWS, BUT RASHEEDA HAS MADE A

15:11.044 --> 15:13.446
MAJOR SACRIFICE FOR HIM, FOR THE

15:13.446 --> 15:16.316
FAMILY, AND BOTTOM LINE IS, KIRK

15:16.316 --> 15:17.750
IS [bleep] THIS WHOLE THING UP.

15:17.750 --> 15:18.986
HE'S GONNA LOSE EVERYTHING IF HE

15:18.986 --> 15:21.054
DOESN'T STOP THIS BULL[bleep].

15:21.054 --> 15:21.821
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT

15:21.821 --> 15:23.290
IS DIVORCE.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.993
HOW MANY CHILDREN DO YOU HAVE?

15:25.993 --> 15:26.893
FIVE.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.661
OKAY, ARE YOU GOING TO BE

16:03.163 --> 16:04.631
I JUST REALLY WANT

19:35.975 --> 19:36.643
I'M SAYING?

19:36.643 --> 19:38.077
DO YOU FEEL THAT MARIJUANA

19:38.077 --> 19:39.111
IS A PROBLEM FOR YOU?

19:39.111 --> 19:40.513
IT'S JUST MARIJUANA,

19:40.513 --> 19:41.281
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

19:41.281 --> 19:43.750
SOME STATES ACTUALLY LEGALIZED

19:43.750 --> 19:44.851
IT, YOU FEEL ME, SO I'M--

19:44.851 --> 19:45.618
WELL, WE'RE DEALING WITH

19:45.618 --> 19:46.453
ATLANTA RIGHT NOW.

19:46.453 --> 19:47.119
YEAH.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.321
SO MY QUESTION IS, IF YOU

19:48.321 --> 19:49.256
KNOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO

19:49.256 --> 19:51.157
A DRUG SCREENING,

19:51.157 --> 19:52.759
WHY WOULD YOU DO IT RIGHT,

19:52.759 --> 19:54.727
YOU KNOW, BEFORE THEN?

19:54.727 --> 19:56.696
I BE NEEDING IT, MAN, LIKE,

19:56.696 --> 19:57.964
TO CALM MY NERVES, LIKE,

19:57.964 --> 19:59.332
JUST TO, YOU KNOW,

19:59.332 --> 20:01.601
EVEN EVERYTHING OUT.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.436
IT FEEL NORMAL TO BE HIGH,

20:03.436 --> 20:04.337
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

20:04.337 --> 20:05.272
IT DON'T, LIKE--

20:05.272 --> 20:06.339
THE WORLD LOOK DIFFERENT,

20:06.339 --> 20:07.039
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

20:07.039 --> 20:07.707
MM-HMM.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.342
SO I JUST DON'T LIKE

20:09.342 --> 20:11.110
BEING SOBER.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.479
WHY NOT?

20:12.479 --> 20:13.613
'CAUSE, I MEAN, YOU REALLY

20:13.613 --> 20:14.981
GOT TO SIT THERE AND DEAL WITH

20:14.981 --> 20:16.949
EVERYTHING THAT'S COMING TO YOU.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.285
PEOPLE THAT CONSIDER

20:18.285 --> 20:19.819
THEMSELVES ADDICTS WILL SAY

20:19.819 --> 20:21.721
THAT, WITHOUT THE DRUG,

20:21.721 --> 20:23.790
THEY CANNOT LIVE LIFE

20:23.790 --> 20:24.924
ON LIFE'S TERMS.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.660
THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH IT.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.995
WHEN YOU HAVE A DEPENDENCY, THEN

20:28.995 --> 20:32.198
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TREATMENT.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.401
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING

20:34.401 --> 20:35.134
ABSTINENCE.

20:35.134 --> 20:38.004
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WORKING ON

20:38.004 --> 20:41.274
SOME OF THE REASONS WHY YOU USE.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.775
ARE YOU INTERESTED IN ADDRESSING

20:42.775 --> 20:43.976
ANY OF THOSE THINGS?

20:43.976 --> 20:45.312
HOW DO YOU ADDRESS IT?

20:45.312 --> 20:46.913
THE FIRST THING IS THAT

20:46.913 --> 20:49.482
I RECOMMEND SUBSTANCE--

20:49.482 --> 20:50.950
[laughs]

20:50.950 --> 20:52.118
OPEN YOUR EARS.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.287
I RECOMMEND SUBSTANCE ABUSE

20:54.287 --> 20:55.254
TREATMENT.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.889
THAT'S WHERE YOU LEARN ABOUT

20:56.889 --> 20:58.825
ADDICTION, YOU LEARN ABOUT

20:58.825 --> 21:00.393
RELAPSE, YOU LEARN ABOUT DEALING

21:00.393 --> 21:02.862
WITH CONFLICT, BUT DURING THAT

21:02.862 --> 21:05.131
TIME, YOU REMAIN ABSTINENT

21:05.131 --> 21:07.133
FROM THE DRUGS.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.370
THE OTHER ONE IS--

21:10.370 --> 21:11.338
ALONG WITH THAT--IS TO DO

21:11.338 --> 21:13.640
SOME INDIVIDUAL THERAPY.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.643
SO I'M A CRAZY GUY NOW?

21:16.643 --> 21:17.344
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT

21:17.344 --> 21:18.177
A PSYCHIATRIST.

21:18.177 --> 21:18.878
OH.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.580
YOU SEE A PSYCHOLOGIST.

21:20.580 --> 21:21.914
A PSYCHOLOGIST WILL BE DOING

21:21.914 --> 21:23.716
TESTING AND BE DOING COUNSELING,

21:23.716 --> 21:25.418
SIMILAR TO WHAT I DO.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.118
OH, OKAY.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.787
OKAY?

21:27.787 --> 21:28.455
ALL RIGHT.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.457
I'LL SEE HOW IT GO.

21:39.532 --> 21:40.232
HEY, BABY.

21:40.232 --> 21:41.200
HI, BEAUTIFUL.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.234
WHAT'S GOING ON, SEXY?

21:42.234 --> 21:43.536
NOTHING. YOU SMELL GOOD.

21:43.536 --> 21:44.203
THANK YOU.

21:44.203 --> 21:45.237
THANKS FOR MY DRINK TOO.

21:45.237 --> 21:46.138
OH, I HAD YOU SET.

21:46.138 --> 21:46.806
YOU'RE GOT ME--

21:46.806 --> 21:47.474
LOOK, AND IT'S MATCHING

21:47.474 --> 21:48.140
MY OUTFIT.

21:48.140 --> 21:48.975
[laughs]

21:48.975 --> 21:49.676
THE MORE I HANG OUT WITH

21:49.676 --> 21:50.643
K.MICHELLE, THE MORE I LIKE HER.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.944
SHE'S COOL. SHE'S FUN.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.079
SHE MAKES ME LAUGH.

21:53.079 --> 21:53.946
YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT SHE HAD

21:53.946 --> 21:55.515
HER OWN ISSUES WITH MEN--

21:55.515 --> 21:56.849
YOU KNOW, SHE CAN PROBABLY

21:56.849 --> 21:58.017
RELATE TO ME AND MY DRAMA.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.285
I THINK I'M IN A PLACE WHERE

21:59.285 --> 22:01.521
IT'S, LIKE, PRETTY GOOD.

22:01.521 --> 22:02.622
YOU HAPPY?

22:02.622 --> 22:04.391
I'M--YOU KNOW--

22:04.391 --> 22:05.958
HE'S REALIZING, AND I THINK

22:05.958 --> 22:07.394
SEEING HIS DAD BEING IN TOWN

22:07.394 --> 22:08.194
TOO--YOU KNOW, STEVIE'S BEEN

22:08.194 --> 22:09.462
TAKING CARE OF HIM, AND I BEEN

22:09.462 --> 22:10.830
HELPING HIM WITH HIS DAD.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.498
REALLY?

22:11.498 --> 22:12.231
YEAH, I BEEN HELPING HIM

22:12.231 --> 22:12.899
TAKE CARE--

22:12.899 --> 22:13.566
IS HIS DAD SICK,

22:13.566 --> 22:14.233
OR YOU JUST--

22:14.233 --> 22:15.301
HE JUST HAD SURGERY.

22:15.301 --> 22:16.636
SO I THINK WE'RE BONDING

22:16.636 --> 22:17.837
A LITTLE BIT, AND I THINK

22:17.837 --> 22:18.638
HE JUST--

22:18.638 --> 22:19.639
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS,

22:19.639 --> 22:21.508
LIKE, WHEN YOU GO THROUGH STUFF,

22:21.508 --> 22:23.209
LIKE, REALLY PERSONAL THINGS

22:23.209 --> 22:24.243
WITH FAMILY

22:24.243 --> 22:25.311
AND THINGS LIKE THAT,

22:25.311 --> 22:28.314
IT ALWAYS BRINGS YOU CLOSER.

22:28.314 --> 22:29.416
WE LOOKED AT HOUSES,

22:29.416 --> 22:30.717
WE TALKED ABOUT MARRIAGE,

22:30.717 --> 22:31.651
AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE

22:31.651 --> 22:32.852
THE RESPONSE FROM HIM.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.320
HE'S JUST LIKE,

22:34.320 --> 22:35.321
"BABY, I LOVE YOU."

22:35.321 --> 22:37.023
YOU KNOW, "LET'S MAKE IT

22:37.023 --> 22:39.091
HAPPEN," LIKE, YOU KNOW?

22:39.091 --> 22:40.192
I DON'T KNOW STEVIE,

22:40.192 --> 22:41.428
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS MAN

22:41.428 --> 22:43.062
HAS CHANGED.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.097
ALL I KNOW IS THAT THAT MAN MAKE

22:45.097 --> 22:47.033
YOU HAPPY, IT AIN'T [bleep]

22:47.033 --> 22:47.767
I COULD DO BUT SAY,

22:47.767 --> 22:48.835
"BITCH, BE HAPPY."

22:48.835 --> 22:50.202
IT'S REALLY WEIRD TO ME

22:50.202 --> 22:52.038
TO LISTEN TO JOSELINE TALK ABOUT

22:52.038 --> 22:53.706
STEVIE, BECAUSE I WATCHED MY

22:53.706 --> 22:55.074
FRIEND MIMI GO THROUGH THE SAME

22:55.074 --> 22:57.544
DRAMA, BUT SHE SEEMS TO

22:57.544 --> 22:58.911
BE HAPPY, AND IT SEEMS LIKE A

22:58.911 --> 23:00.847
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SITUATION.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.114
PEOPLE DO CHANGE.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.316
ON ANOTHER NOTE--

23:04.316 --> 23:06.619
ALL RIGHT, NOW. LOOK, NOW.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.755
KARLIE--

23:08.755 --> 23:10.089
[sighs]

23:10.089 --> 23:10.757
AUNTIE KARLIE.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.291
BUT Y'ALL WAS FRIENDS.

23:12.291 --> 23:13.560
WELL, NO, WE WAS COOL, BUT

23:13.560 --> 23:15.327
REMEMBER, SHE STARTED SOME RUMOR

23:15.327 --> 23:16.362
SAYING THAT BENZINO HAD SEX

23:16.362 --> 23:17.029
WITH ME AND A WHOLE BUNCH

23:17.029 --> 23:17.830
OF BULL[bleep].

23:17.830 --> 23:18.898
SO Y'ALL NOT COOL ANYMORE.

23:18.898 --> 23:22.001
I NEVER--I SLAPPED THE BITCH.

23:22.001 --> 23:22.702
NO.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.671
SEE, THAT'S WHY I LIKE YOU.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.072
WHAT ABOUT THIS HO ANYWAY?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.073
I THINK SHE'S TRYING TO GET

23:27.073 --> 23:28.475
BETTER ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS.

23:28.475 --> 23:29.709
I HONESTLY DO.

23:29.709 --> 23:30.710
SO ARE YOU TRYING TO, LIKE,

23:30.710 --> 23:31.711
PUT ME BACK TOGETHER WITH,

23:31.711 --> 23:32.912
LIKE, KARLIE REDD'S SITUATION?

23:32.912 --> 23:33.880
NO, I'M TRYING TO SAY

23:33.880 --> 23:36.849
SHE'S HAVING A PERFORMANCE--

23:36.849 --> 23:37.950
A SHOWCASE.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.487
SHE STILL DO MUSIC?

23:40.487 --> 23:42.054
YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:42.054 --> 23:42.955
WELL, I'M GLAD SHE'S FOCUSING

23:42.955 --> 23:44.056
ON HER CAREER MORE THAN SHE'S

23:44.056 --> 23:45.492
FOCUSING ON OTHER PEOPLE,

23:45.492 --> 23:47.527
SO MAYBE SHE CAN HAVE A CAREER

23:47.527 --> 23:49.496
AND STOP BEING A MESSY BITCH.

23:49.496 --> 23:50.396
SO I'M GLAD SHE'S DOING

23:50.396 --> 23:51.063
A SHOWCASE.

23:51.063 --> 23:51.931
REALLY, I'M--I'M--I'M--

23:51.931 --> 23:53.265
I'M EXCITED. THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

23:53.265 --> 23:56.202
OKAY, SO I SAY ME AND YOU GO.

23:56.202 --> 23:57.837
I THINK THAT IS A BIG STEP

23:57.837 --> 23:58.671
FOR US GETTING INTO THE GATES

23:58.671 --> 23:59.939
OF HEAVEN.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.307
IS THIS GONNA BE ON A TUESDAY

24:01.307 --> 24:02.274
OR A MONDAY WHEN I AIN'T GOT

24:02.274 --> 24:03.075
bleep] TO DO?

24:03.075 --> 24:04.076
OH, MY--

24:04.076 --> 24:06.946
[laughs]

24:06.946 --> 24:07.680
WHY DON'T YOU START OFF

24:07.680 --> 24:08.748
WITH APOLOGIZING?

24:08.748 --> 24:09.949
I [bleep] AROUND

24:09.949 --> 24:12.218
WHEN YOU WERE PREGNANT.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.353
I BROUGHT JOS.

24:14.353 --> 24:16.355
IT'S IN PEACE.

24:23.530 --> 24:24.363

24:26.666 --> 24:28.000
THE MODERN MEAL.

24:28.000 --> 24:28.668

24:28.668 --> 24:29.435
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT I STILL

24:29.435 --> 24:30.737
REALLY CARE ABOUT TRACI, AND

24:30.737 --> 24:31.804
WHEN I SAW HER WITH HER NEW MAN,

24:31.804 --> 24:33.372
IT DEFINITELY BROUGHT SOME EXTRA

24:33.372 --> 24:34.340
EMOTIONS OUT THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE

24:34.340 --> 24:35.041
BEEN THERE.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.176
AT FIRST GLANCE, I WAS THINKING,

24:37.176 --> 24:38.545
"WE SHOULD GET BACK TOGETHER,"

24:38.545 --> 24:40.346
BUT NOW I KNOW, NO.

24:40.346 --> 24:41.648
THEN I WIND UP [bleep] UP HER

24:41.648 --> 24:43.550
RELATIONSHIP WITH DASHAUN.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.150
I FEEL BAD.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.219
I REALIZED AFTER THE WHOLE

24:47.219 --> 24:49.789
SITUATION, LIKE, I REALLY

24:49.789 --> 24:51.223
[bleep] THIS UP, AND I DIDN'T

24:51.223 --> 24:52.024
KNOW THAT I WAS GONNA [bleep]

24:52.024 --> 24:52.692

24:52.692 --> 24:54.093
LIKE, YOU WERE HAPPY,

24:54.093 --> 24:55.928
IT WAS GOOD, LIKE, AND ALL

24:55.928 --> 24:56.896
OF A SUDDEN, IT'S JUST A WRAP,

24:56.896 --> 24:58.898
LIKE, IN SECONDS.

24:58.898 --> 24:59.899
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24:59.899 --> 25:01.701
I'M REACTING TO A LIE.

25:01.701 --> 25:02.802
SO YOU'RE JUST, LIKE,

25:02.802 --> 25:03.870

25:04.904 --> 25:05.738
ALTOGETHER.

25:05.738 --> 25:06.472
I'M GOOD.

25:06.472 --> 25:07.306
BECAUSE OF, WHAT A LITTLE--

25:07.306 --> 25:08.340
SMALL, LITTLE LIE.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.208
"A SMALL, LITTLE LIE."

25:09.208 --> 25:10.476
THAT'S WHERE IT STARTS,

25:10.476 --> 25:11.143
DON'T IT?

25:11.143 --> 25:11.978
REMEMBER THOSE SMALL, LITTLE

25:11.978 --> 25:13.813
LIES YOU USED TO TELL?

25:13.813 --> 25:14.914
SO YOU'RE GOING BACK SEVEN

25:14.914 --> 25:17.049
YEARS TO SOME [bleep] THAT

25:17.049 --> 25:18.350
I DID, AND YOU'RE GONNA BRING IT

25:18.350 --> 25:19.251
OVER INTO SOME [bleep]

25:19.251 --> 25:20.186
WITH THIS GUY?

25:20.186 --> 25:21.053
DASHAUN SAT AT THE TABLE,

25:21.053 --> 25:22.354
AND HE LIED, AND HE MADE ME FEEL

25:22.354 --> 25:24.290
LIKE I'M NOT ON A NEW PATH.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.758
LIKE, I DON'T--IT'S A CYCLE.

25:25.758 --> 25:26.593
IT'S NOT A CYCLE.

25:26.593 --> 25:27.393
YES, IT IS.

25:27.393 --> 25:28.260
IT'S A CYCLE, AND I'M NOT--

25:28.260 --> 25:28.928
I'M NOT GOING DOWN

25:28.928 --> 25:29.596
THAT ROAD AGAIN.

25:29.596 --> 25:30.362
WE COULD SIT HERE AND TALK

25:30.362 --> 25:31.363
ABOUT THIS [bleep] OVER AND OVER

25:31.363 --> 25:32.599
AGAIN LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.

25:32.599 --> 25:33.265
WHY DON'T YOU START OFF

25:33.265 --> 25:34.066
WITH APOLOGIZING.

25:34.066 --> 25:34.734
START WITH THAT.

25:34.734 --> 25:35.401
YOU'RE RIGHT, I--

25:35.401 --> 25:36.068
YOU BRUSHED IT OFF.

25:36.068 --> 25:36.836
I BRUSHED IT OFF, SO LET'S

25:36.836 --> 25:37.503
NOT BRUSH IT OFF.

25:37.503 --> 25:38.871
LET'S NOT BRUSH IT OFF.

25:38.871 --> 25:39.639
I [bleep] AROUND

25:39.639 --> 25:41.641

33:37.549 --> 33:40.086

33:40.086 --> 33:41.087
SHE DON'T WANT ME TO DO IT

33:41.087 --> 33:42.554
'CAUSE SHE KNOW I GOT ASTHMA,

33:42.554 --> 33:44.723
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, SHE--

33:44.723 --> 33:46.325

33:55.567 --> 33:56.235
I LOVE HER TO DEATH.

33:56.235 --> 33:56.968
SO IF YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE

33:56.968 --> 33:57.969

33:59.138 --> 34:00.239

34:01.107 --> 34:03.575
YOU MAKING RIGHT NOW.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.377
SITUATION YOU'RE IN RIGHT NOW

34:05.377 --> 34:07.513
IS ABOUT CHOOSING.

34:07.513 --> 34:08.947
YOU NEED SOMETHING TO SERVE

34:08.947 --> 34:11.417
AS A REMINDER OF YOUR DECISIONS.

34:11.417 --> 34:12.384
WHAT'S YOUR DAUGHTER'S NAME?

34:12.384 --> 34:13.219
EMANI.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.120
WHEN THERE'S A DECISION

34:14.120 --> 34:15.354
YOU NEED TO MAKE--

34:15.354 --> 34:17.022

34:20.726 --> 34:22.961
OF EMANI IN YOUR MIND,

34:22.961 --> 34:27.032
AND YOU ASK HER FIRST.

34:27.032 --> 34:28.367
YOU NEED A VACATION FROM YOUR

34:28.367 --> 34:30.869
MOM AND HER DECISION-MAKING.

34:30.869 --> 34:32.304
SHE ALSO CAN INFLUENCE YOUR

34:32.304 --> 34:35.274
DAUGHTER, BECAUSE ULTIMATELY,

34:35.274 --> 34:38.577
EITHER EMANI WILL BE A FRESHMAN

34:38.577 --> 34:40.679
AT SPELMAN COLLEGE, MAJORING IN

34:48.987 --> 34:50.256
THE WORLD, COULD GIVE A DAMN

34:50.256 --> 34:53.759
ABOUT ANOTHER GIRL--NOTHING.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.327

34:55.327 --> 34:58.230
AND YOU KNOW, THE WAY HE PUT IT,

I NEED TO MAKE SOME CHANGES

35:00.632 --> 35:01.400
IN MY LIFE.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.634
THAT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO

35:02.634 --> 35:04.303
WITH YOUR IMPACT AND YOUR

35:04.303 --> 35:06.305
DECISION-MAKING RIGHT NOW.

35:26.225 --> 35:26.892
EVERY GIRL LOVE

35:26.892 --> 35:28.194
A JEWELRY STORE.

35:28.194 --> 35:28.960
'CAUSE I COULD WALK AROUND

35:28.960 --> 35:30.028
A JEWELRY STORE ALL DAY,

35:30.028 --> 35:30.829
AND I COULD PICK OUT JEWELRY

35:30.829 --> 35:32.464
FOR MYSELF, BUT TODAY

35:32.464 --> 35:33.765

35:33.765 --> 35:35.000
I'M LOOKING FOR A RING

35:35.000 --> 35:35.967
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.236
* I AIN'T A PLAYER ♪

35:37.236 --> 35:38.337
I AM TIRED OF WAITING

35:38.337 --> 35:39.438
FOR STEVIE TO MAKE THE MOVE,

35:39.438 --> 35:40.272
AND I DON'T THINK HE'LL EVER

35:40.272 --> 35:41.440
MAKE THE MOVE, 'CAUSE HE'S TOO

35:41.440 --> 35:43.008
SCARED, SO IF STEVIE'S NOT

35:43.008 --> 35:44.343
MAKING THAT MOVE, JOSELINE

35:44.343 --> 35:45.244
HERNANDEZ IS GONNA MAKE

35:45.244 --> 35:46.412
THAT MOVE.

35:46.412 --> 35:47.213
YES.

35:47.213 --> 35:48.647

35:48.647 --> 35:49.815
STRONG LIKE HIM.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.116
AND CAN YOU PUT, LIKE,

OUR NAMES INSIDE OF THERE?

35:52.651 --> 35:53.319
YEAH.

35:53.319 --> 35:54.052
SO YOU COULD JUST PUT HIS

35:54.052 --> 35:55.687
NAME, MY NAME, AND EVERYTHING

35:55.687 --> 35:56.455
IN ONE?

35:56.455 --> 35:57.423
OKAY.

35:57.423 --> 35:58.089
HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE

35:58.089 --> 35:59.225
TO PUT IT IN THERE?

35:59.225 --> 36:00.859
'CAUSE I'M TAKING THIS TRIP,

36:00.859 --> 36:01.993
AND I HAVE TO GIVE--

36:01.993 --> 36:02.728
IT TAKES--

36:02.728 --> 36:04.230
IT TAKES, LIKE, A COUPLE HOURS.

36:04.230 --> 36:05.030
OH, OKAY, SO IT WON'T TAKE

36:05.030 --> 36:05.997
YOU LONG.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.433
I'M TAKING IT.

36:07.433 --> 36:08.934
A LUCKY GUY.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.902
IS HE REALLY?

36:10.902 --> 36:12.904
[laughs]

36:17.476 --> 36:20.779
HE NEED TO BE SHAKEN UP!

36:20.779 --> 36:21.480
YO, YO.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.948
I'M NOT THROUGH WITH YOU!

36:22.948 --> 36:24.950
I'LL SHOW YOU WHO'S CRAZY.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.131
I DON'T EVEN THINK KIRK EVEN

36:40.131 --> 36:43.269
REALIZES WHAT HE'S DOING.

36:43.269 --> 36:43.969
HE CALLED ME...

36:43.969 --> 36:44.636
MM-HMM.

36:44.636 --> 36:45.404
BUT I DIDN'T ANSWER

36:45.404 --> 36:46.672
THE PHONE, BECAUSE I SAID,

36:46.672 --> 36:47.373
"YOU KNOW WHAT, [bleep]?

36:47.373 --> 36:48.274
MAN THE [bleep] UP.

36:48.274 --> 36:48.940
YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME, COME

36:48.940 --> 36:50.642
AND TALK TO ME FACE-TO-FACE.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.010
DON'T CALL ME ON THE TELEPHONE."

36:52.010 --> 36:53.111
OKAY, SO WHEN HE WAS CALLING

36:53.111 --> 36:54.946
YOU, DID HE COME HOME WHEN YOU

36:54.946 --> 36:56.682
DIDN'T ANSWER THE PHONE?

36:56.682 --> 36:57.416
HE STILL DIDN'T COME HOME?

36:57.416 --> 36:58.183
SO THAT'S WHY I FELT LIKE,

36:58.183 --> 36:58.850
YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:58.850 --> 37:00.319
THEN EVIDENTLY, SOMETHING--

37:00.319 --> 37:01.387
IT'S SOME BULL[bleep].

37:01.387 --> 37:03.054
I'M NOT SEEING ANY HONEST EFFORT

37:03.054 --> 37:04.456
IN KIRK ON TRYING TO REPAIR THE

37:04.456 --> 37:06.057
TRUST THAT HE HAS BROKEN IN THIS

37:06.057 --> 37:08.026
RELATIONSHIP, SO WHAT I'M DOING

37:08.026 --> 37:09.361
IS, I'M TAKING MATTERS INTO MY

37:09.361 --> 37:11.663
OWN HANDS LIKE A BOSS SHOULD.

37:11.663 --> 37:12.998
I DECIDED I WANTED TO GO

37:12.998 --> 37:14.966
AND TALK TO A LAWYER

37:14.966 --> 37:17.002
ABOUT THE STEPS ON POSSIBLY

37:17.002 --> 37:18.069
HAVING A DIVORCE.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.505
IT HAS GONE THAT FAR?

37:19.505 --> 37:20.939
OF COURSE I DON'T WANT TO

37:20.939 --> 37:22.941
JUST GIVE UP ON MY MARRIAGE.

37:22.941 --> 37:23.975
I'M NOT FITTIN' TO BE THE ONLY

37:23.975 --> 37:25.944
ONE TRYING, AND I FEEL LIKE

37:25.944 --> 37:28.314
I'M THE ONLY ONE HURT.

37:28.314 --> 37:29.848
I'M PREGNANT AS HELL, AND MY

37:29.848 --> 37:31.983
HUSBAND, FOR 13 YEARS THAT WE

37:31.983 --> 37:33.385
BEEN TOGETHER, ALL OF A SUDDEN

37:33.385 --> 37:34.820
IS GOING THROUGH SOME TYPE OF

37:34.820 --> 37:38.156
FREAKING MAN CRISIS OR WHATEVER

37:38.156 --> 37:39.325
IT IS, AND HE DECIDING HE WANT

37:39.325 --> 37:40.426
TO GO OUT AND BE TURKED UP

37:40.426 --> 37:41.092
WITH BITCHES.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.461
WHO GOES ON A LAKE TRIP

37:42.461 --> 37:43.695
TO GO DO SOME DIRTY [bleep]

37:43.695 --> 37:45.130
LIKE HE WAS DOING?

37:45.130 --> 37:46.532
ACCUSING ME OF SOME [bleep], AND

37:46.532 --> 37:47.666
HE THE ONE OUT HERE DOING IT.

37:47.666 --> 37:48.367
EXACTLY.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.335
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

37:49.335 --> 37:50.402
AND I KNEW I WAS RIGHT.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.938
EVERY TIME I FEEL THAT INTUITION

37:52.938 --> 37:54.239
OF [bleep], I'M RIGHT.

37:54.239 --> 37:55.441
I STILL CAN'T IMAGINE KIRK

37:55.441 --> 37:57.008
GETTING NASTY WITH THE NEXT

37:57.008 --> 37:59.578
BITCH, TRICK, HO, SLUT, TRAMP--

37:59.578 --> 38:00.979
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.348
I JUST CAN'T SEE [bleep],

38:02.348 --> 38:03.382
AND TO BE REAL WITH YOU,

38:03.382 --> 38:04.916
HE BETTER NOT SEE IT NEITHER.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.084
ALL HE THINKING ABOUT IS

38:06.084 --> 38:07.118
HISSELF AND WHAT HE WANTED--

38:07.118 --> 38:08.487
HE NEED TO BE SHAKEN UP!

38:08.487 --> 38:11.256
YOU ALWAYS DO 150% OF EVERYTHING

38:11.256 --> 38:12.658
THAT YOU DO!

38:12.658 --> 38:14.493
EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO.

38:14.493 --> 38:15.361
HE DON'T--I DON'T THINK HE

38:15.361 --> 38:16.027
SEES THAT.

38:16.027 --> 38:17.363
HOW DO HE NOT SEE THAT?

38:17.363 --> 38:18.364
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

38:18.364 --> 38:19.164
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO YOU

38:19.164 --> 38:20.098
FOR YOU TO DO ME LIKE THIS?

38:20.098 --> 38:20.966
