WEBVTT

00:28.445 --> 00:30.447
(coughing)

00:46.547 --> 00:48.299
(sighs)

00:57.683 --> 01:00.482
- Oh, God.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.426
(sighs)

01:37.472 --> 01:39.270
(exhales)

01:43.520 --> 01:48.196
(man): Mr. Morrison, you are here
because you are in contempt of court.

01:49.067 --> 01:52.196
The Building Commission has documented

01:52.362 --> 01:57.084
repeated efforts to give you an opportunity
to bring your house to code.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.166
There are 26 violations

02:00.329 --> 02:01.751
against the structure

02:02.080 --> 02:04.629
and they're requesting
that your house be bulldozed.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.715
It has also come to my attention
that you have

02:07.878 --> 02:11.849
violated a court order expressly prohibiting
building on the site

02:12.049 --> 02:14.427
until those matters have been resolved.

02:14.593 --> 02:19.019
Do you understand
the gravity of these charges?

02:19.348 --> 02:20.816
That you could go to jail?

02:21.350 --> 02:22.522
- Yes, I do.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.072
Are you a baseball fan,
Your Honour?

02:30.108 --> 02:31.234
- Excuse me?

02:40.035 --> 02:41.378
(man): When I was 11

02:41.536 --> 02:44.460
my father took me to Boston to see a game.

02:44.623 --> 02:45.875
It was a doubleheader

02:46.041 --> 02:49.090
between the Boston Red Sox
and the Yankees.

02:49.252 --> 02:54.099
Dad pulled a baseball
out of his pocket and he said to me,

02:54.257 --> 02:59.013
"You go down there to that dugout
and get Babe Ruth to sign that ball. "

02:59.179 --> 03:02.353
I'm going to tell you right out of the bush
I was scared to death.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.564
<i>Anyhow, so down I go.</i>

03:04.726 --> 03:09.027
Babe Ruth said to me,
"Why sure, Sonny, I'll sign your ball. "

03:09.189 --> 03:11.112
Then, at the other end of the dugout,

03:11.274 --> 03:15.120
Lou Gehrig was looking at some bats.
He signed her, too.

03:15.946 --> 03:20.622
Well, sir, that ball is famous even today.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.788
Lelands wanted to put it
in their auction down in New York.

03:24.621 --> 03:27.670
They wrote about me and that ball
in the St. John paper.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.507
I still have the article.

03:30.669 --> 03:33.263
(boy): Who's Babe Ruth, Grampy?

03:33.422 --> 03:36.426
(chuckles)

03:36.591 --> 03:39.686
- Just the greatest sportsman
that ever lived.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.189
Hey, how old are you, anyway?

03:42.347 --> 03:43.473
- Nine.

03:43.765 --> 03:47.770
- You mean to tell me you're nine years old
and no one's told you who Babe Ruth is yet?

03:47.894 --> 03:49.646
- No. How old are you?

03:50.021 --> 03:51.068
- Eighty-seven.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.233
- Do you know who Drake is?

03:54.985 --> 03:56.328
' Who?

03:56.486 --> 03:57.829
- Then we're even.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.410
(woman laughing)

04:00.282 --> 04:01.875
- The little bugger reminds me of his father.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.956
- He reminds me of someone else I know.

04:06.955 --> 04:10.585
(laughter)
(indistinct chatter)

04:26.475 --> 04:29.149
Doesn't seem like a day for a funeral,
does it?

04:29.311 --> 04:30.938
- No.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.903
Then again, I don't imagine
too many days do.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.078
- Do you think much about dying?

04:39.613 --> 04:42.457
- Probably not as much as I should.

04:45.035 --> 04:49.131
- When I was young,
I looked at old people

04:49.289 --> 04:51.917
and thought,
"if you live long enough,

04:52.083 --> 04:54.962
you probably had time
to figure out dying."

04:58.507 --> 05:02.137
But I'm no closer now
to the great mystery

05:02.302 --> 05:05.021
than when I was ten.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.143
- See that as a problem, do you?

05:11.895 --> 05:14.398
- We'll find out soon enough.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.568
- Speak for yourself.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.079
I plan on beating the odds.

05:25.534 --> 05:28.378
(priest): Shall we bow
in a moment of prayer together?

05:58.567 --> 06:02.913
(radio): The TSX hit a record again
yesterday reaching 14,660

06:03.071 --> 06:06.701
and shattering last year's high of 14,625.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.164
That represents a--

06:20.088 --> 06:22.841
(mumbling)

06:26.177 --> 06:28.179
- Good morning, ladies.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.223
(clucking)

06:31.600 --> 06:33.773
Oh...
(clicks tongue)

06:58.001 --> 07:00.424
- We should have put the beds
in these years ago.

07:00.587 --> 07:04.182
- Your oldest daughter thinks
we look like trailer trash.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.968
- It's installation art.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.852
(chuckles)

07:15.185 --> 07:17.608
(loud buzzing)

07:34.579 --> 07:36.252
(tree cracking)

07:53.056 --> 07:56.151
(mooi?g)

08:01.856 --> 08:04.029
Do you see the cows?

08:07.112 --> 08:09.035
- Yes, dear, I see the cows.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.870
- I wonder who they belong to.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.669
- They're ours.
You know that.

08:18.915 --> 08:19.962
Ho! Ho!

08:20.125 --> 08:23.299
(mooi?g)

08:23.461 --> 08:26.214
Come on now, come on.
Ha! Ha!

08:26.381 --> 08:29.225
(milk spraying into bucket)

08:32.261 --> 08:34.356
- Hey, Dad.
- Ruthie.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.438
- How'd the checkup go?
(sighs)

08:38.601 --> 08:41.195
- Clean bill of health for both of us.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.525
- Really?
- Mm...

08:43.857 --> 08:45.859
- Doctor didn't say anything
about her memory?

08:46.026 --> 08:47.653
- I forgot to ask him.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.789
(chuckles)
- You're kidding, right?

08:51.281 --> 08:53.909
- No, really, I forgot.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.498
Maybe I should be asking
about my memory.

08:56.661 --> 08:57.628
- Huh...

08:57.787 --> 09:01.007
Where's Mom?
- She's out in the truck.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.168
- She didn't want to come in?

09:03.334 --> 09:05.007
- No, she was content to stay put.

09:13.261 --> 09:16.231
Maybe we should buy our milk
at the store.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.232
- How's Ruth?
(grunts)

09:20.685 --> 09:23.063
(engine starts)

09:31.321 --> 09:33.699
- Hey, Dad.
- John.

09:33.865 --> 09:35.037
Need anything in Sussex?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.373
- I'm going over to pick up some fencing.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.128
- Not right now.

09:40.747 --> 09:41.839
I heard about the cows.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.342
(chuckles)

09:44.501 --> 09:46.299
- Everybody's heard about the cows.

09:46.461 --> 09:47.428
(snickers)

09:47.587 --> 09:50.090
Well, I'm done with them.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.133
- What, really?

09:52.300 --> 09:54.974
- Unless, of course,
if you want them.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.685
- Well, you know,
with the beef market the way it is,

09:57.847 --> 09:59.565
it's not really a hobby
I can afford, so...

09:59.724 --> 10:01.192
- Fair enough.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.361
(loud thump)

10:11.528 --> 10:12.654
(sighs)
Really?

10:12.821 --> 10:15.040
(tire thudding)
Now?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.668
(sigh)

10:20.870 --> 10:22.042
(quiet grunt)

10:34.509 --> 10:36.182
(engine stops)

10:40.765 --> 10:43.484
- How many miles you got
on them tires, Craig?

10:43.643 --> 10:47.443
You know, this is what happens
when you're too cheap to buy new ones.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.447
- I heard the boys bought themselves
a new tractor.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.829
Sure surprised they gave the old man
the keys, though.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.908
- No wonder those cows escaped.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.203
I would have replaced
some of those fence posts years ago.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.748
- How's that strawberry crop of yours
doing there, Chester?

11:05.623 --> 11:08.547
- Oh, goddamn global warming.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.463
I haven't seen a spring
with this much rain ever.

11:11.629 --> 11:15.304
- That's funny,
I got more berries than I can handle.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.639
So you know anybody
who's looking for work picking...

11:17.802 --> 11:19.896
you send them my way.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.479
- Well, aren't you a smug bastard.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.608
(engine starts)

11:46.456 --> 11:48.800
- What if I was ten minutes later?

11:52.128 --> 11:54.551
- Goodness, Craig,
what did you do to our kitchen?

11:56.299 --> 11:59.769
- I didn't do anything to the kitchen.
You left an oven mitt on the stove.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.726
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.481
I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

12:37.090 --> 12:38.558
- Well...

12:38.716 --> 12:40.218
we've been talking about it.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.389
- Who's "we"?

12:46.849 --> 12:49.352
- Well, your first mistake
was having seven children, so...

12:50.311 --> 12:53.110
- She has her good days
and her bad days, that's all.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.192
She's fine.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.771
- Do you smell smoke?

13:31.602 --> 13:34.572
- I was burning some brush out back today.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.825
Some of it must have blown into the house.

13:51.289 --> 13:52.836
- I want to see you.

13:55.501 --> 13:59.005
- It's been a while.
- Has it?

14:00.006 --> 14:02.054
Take off your clothes, old man.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.482
(sighs)

14:37.293 --> 14:38.715
- I'm sorry.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.305
- What for?

14:45.093 --> 14:46.185
- Nothing.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.560
I'm just sorry.

14:53.935 --> 14:57.690
- It never gets old, does it?

14:57.855 --> 14:59.323
- No, it doesn't.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.324
We always did the passion part well.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.910
Remember that hotel in St. John...

15:12.370 --> 15:13.917
when we were first married?

15:15.331 --> 15:18.335
- Remember the drive to St. John
before the hotel?

15:21.712 --> 15:26.388
- Jeez, you always seemed
so prim and proper.

15:26.551 --> 15:27.848
- I was...

15:30.096 --> 15:31.769
until I met you.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.357
- Who would have guessed it?

15:43.568 --> 15:47.368
- Oh, strawberries are A-1 this year, boss.
- Yes, they are, Gus.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.785
We'll take off another load this afternoon
once it cools down.

15:52.577 --> 15:53.544
- Roger that.

15:54.245 --> 15:55.371
(honks horn)

16:02.879 --> 16:07.055
- Mr. Morrison,
didn't expect to see you again this year.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.513
- Oh? Why's that?

16:08.676 --> 16:10.553
- Didn't you get my letter?
- Hmm...

16:10.720 --> 16:12.222
Not that I recall, no.

16:12.388 --> 16:15.642
- We sent it back in February
on account of new regulations.

16:15.808 --> 16:19.187
We only buy from growers who ship
their products in refrigerated trucks.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.824
- These were on the plants not two hours ago.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.994
There's no heat of the day in them at all.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.622
- Well, it's a head-office decision.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.415
- Any wiggle room on this?
- Afraid not.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.794
(Sigh)
- Well, that just means I'm shit out of luck.

16:39.832 --> 16:43.086
I can't afford a refrigerated truck
for less than an acre.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.720
- Yeah, I know.

16:44.879 --> 16:47.177
I'm sorry, I wish there was
something I could do about it.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.843
- Yeah. Me too.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.480
It seems like there's some kind of regulation
for everything nowadays.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.485
Never understood
why you can't just double the recipe.

17:03.648 --> 17:06.867
We could make a whole lot more.
- It doesn't work that way.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.996
- No. Old wives' tale.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.873
- Craig...
- Hm?

17:13.031 --> 17:15.876
- Just because you have
a field of strawberries,

17:16.035 --> 17:19.414
I'm not going to make 10,000 jars of jam.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.049
Give them away.

17:29.799 --> 17:30.800
(sighs)

17:30.967 --> 17:32.059
(sniffs)

17:38.891 --> 17:40.484
- Goddammit.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.409
(sighs)

17:57.076 --> 17:58.623
Here we go.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.629
(quiet grunt)

18:09.922 --> 18:13.017
This reminds me
of my milk delivering days.

18:13.175 --> 18:16.304
Back before I knew you,
I had a horse and a wagon.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.557
Took over the route
from old man Lefebvre.

18:19.724 --> 18:20.941
- I know.

18:32.403 --> 18:34.371
(loud buzzing)

18:48.961 --> 18:50.884
(washing machine hums)

19:20.493 --> 19:22.587
(geese honking)

19:27.041 --> 19:28.964
(wind whistling)

19:40.096 --> 19:42.190
- The water in the toilet
froze last night.

19:44.809 --> 19:47.187
My bet is it's going to freeze again tonight.

19:49.605 --> 19:53.075
We've already been through
three cords of wood this winter.

19:53.234 --> 19:55.657
Barely keeping this place warm.

19:55.820 --> 19:58.414
Truth is, may not be much longer

19:58.572 --> 20:01.041
before this place
doesn't work for us anymore.

20:03.828 --> 20:06.206
The view's not all that great either.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.296
- You sound like Ruth.
- Oh?

20:09.458 --> 20:11.631
- No, I'm not moving into town.

20:11.794 --> 20:14.673
And you'll have to shoot me
before you find me in a retirement home.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.467
The only view there

20:17.633 --> 20:20.352
is of the slow shuffle into the ground.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.639
- That's not what I meant.

20:24.640 --> 20:28.110
I was thinking of building us
something smaller,

20:28.269 --> 20:30.317
more manageable,

20:30.479 --> 20:32.732
on that plot of ours across the road.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.241
One level.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.239
- We don't have the money.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.663
This place isn't worth a thing.
- Mm.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.870
- And we're not taking a mortgage.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.078
- If I did the work myself,
we could afford it.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.499
With the strawberries
and the cattle gone,

20:49.665 --> 20:51.838
I seem to have a lot more free time.

20:59.467 --> 21:00.935
- Promise me one thing.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.267
- Mm-hmm.

21:03.888 --> 21:07.643
- We won't move until we have to.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.645
- Fair enough.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.959
(saw buzzing)

21:34.627 --> 21:35.844
' Dad!

21:40.049 --> 21:41.767
(buzzing stops)

21:43.511 --> 21:45.934
Well, it looks like you got
another project in mind.

21:46.514 --> 21:49.688
- Are you the official spokesman
for all your brothers and sisters,

21:49.850 --> 21:51.318
or just here by yourself?

21:52.520 --> 21:53.692
- A bit of both.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.524
- Well, that's nice.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.739
- No, we just felt awful
if it wasn't mentioned

21:59.902 --> 22:02.405
that you could get someone else
to build it for you.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.164
- No. Don't have the money.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.996
- Dad, you're sitting on 2,000 acres.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.752
Sell off a piece.
- You know as well as I do,

22:08.911 --> 22:10.754
if you're going to live here
you need a big land base.

22:10.913 --> 22:12.881
- Big land base, yeah.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.384
- Besides, nothing's stopping me
from doing the work.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.841
- Except that you're in your eighties.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.927
- Well, Son, way I look at it,

22:21.090 --> 22:23.684
age is just an abstraction,
not a straightjacket.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.187
(chuckles)
The truth is...

22:26.846 --> 22:29.019
I'm sort of looking forward to it.

22:29.181 --> 22:32.401
I haven't had a big project
like this in quite a while.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.191
- Fair enough.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.608
Is there anything any of us
can do to help here?

22:38.774 --> 22:41.618
- Sure.
Need a bit of work with the backhoe

22:41.777 --> 22:44.280
if you've got the time.
- Yeah, no problem.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.956
Um...

22:50.119 --> 22:52.588
Can you at least promise me
that you'll be careful?

22:52.746 --> 22:54.214
- What?

22:55.040 --> 22:58.965
- You know, if you... cut your hand off
with the circular saw

22:59.128 --> 23:01.847
in a fit of geriatric stupidity,

23:02.006 --> 23:05.636
my sisters, my wife, they're not
going to let me forget about that, so, uh...

23:05.801 --> 23:07.223
- Wow!

23:07.386 --> 23:11.061
Must be tough waking up every morning
afraid of tripping over your own shadow.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.191
- Aw...
(laughing)

23:17.104 --> 23:18.856
(grunts)

23:19.607 --> 23:22.702
- So the living room
will go right here.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.243
Don't want to make it too big.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.667
I figure if the house
faces in this direction,

23:30.826 --> 23:32.624
that should give us the best view.

23:33.621 --> 23:34.838
(chuckles)

23:35.414 --> 23:37.837
I bet on a clear day
you can see half the county.

23:41.754 --> 23:42.846
Irene?

23:44.924 --> 23:46.767
What do you think?

23:47.551 --> 23:49.474
- What are we doing, Craig?

23:50.262 --> 23:52.560
- Irene, we've been over this before.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.855
We won't move in until we're ready.

24:01.148 --> 24:04.322
That's a promise, okay?

24:08.781 --> 24:09.873
. Okay-

24:11.200 --> 24:13.077
(quietly): Thank you.

24:14.078 --> 24:17.127
(clears throat)
- So it's true.

24:17.289 --> 24:20.133
You know, I didn't believe it
when I heard it.

24:21.085 --> 24:23.929
I figured they'd have to carry you
out of here in a pine box

24:24.088 --> 24:26.887
before you'd spend money on a new house.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.471
Who you getting to build it?

24:30.094 --> 24:32.893
- Chester, why do you ask questions
you already know the answer to?

24:35.724 --> 24:37.852
- You got a permit?
- A permit?

24:38.018 --> 24:40.942
(chuckles)
Why would I need a permit?

24:41.105 --> 24:43.324
This is my land.
(Chester sighs)

24:43.482 --> 24:45.826
- Ever since they did the Royal Commission
two years ago,

24:45.985 --> 24:50.115
you got to have an official stamp
if you want to take a crap.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.329
Trust me.
You definitely need a permit.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.493
- Yep-

24:56.495 --> 24:58.748
(chuckles)

24:58.914 --> 25:01.963
It just seems funny to me
that I should have to pay $400

25:02.126 --> 25:05.756
to build the house on a piece of property
I already own and pay taxes on.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.344
- Yeah, we get that quite a bit.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.351
It's an administrative fee.
As you're building the house,

25:11.510 --> 25:14.730
we come out and check on you
and make sure it complies to code.

25:14.888 --> 25:17.311
- Well, I suppose someone needs a job,

25:17.474 --> 25:19.397
but it's completely unnecessary.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.359
In case you haven't noticed,
there are a lot of houses in Saint Martins

25:22.521 --> 25:24.364
that are well over 200 years old.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.945
They're still standing.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.115
Where was your code then?
- Yes sir.

25:29.278 --> 25:32.532
I think you're missing the point, but yeah.
- I sure am.

25:33.699 --> 25:35.918
But if that's the way it's going to go,

25:36.076 --> 25:38.795
I guess I'll just have to hand over the $400.
(tears cheque out)

25:38.954 --> 25:40.797
There you go.
- Thanks.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.796
And I'll just need to see your plans.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.211
- Plans for what?

25:45.961 --> 25:47.178
- For the house.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.715
- I don't have any plans.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.681
- Well, how are you going to build a house
without any plans?

25:53.469 --> 25:55.392
- The way I've been doing it all my life.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.268
I know what I want.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.691
- Well, how do you know?

26:02.144 --> 26:03.942
- Because it's in my head,
that's how.

26:04.104 --> 26:06.357
- Well, that doesn't solve our problem.

26:06.523 --> 26:07.991
We need stamped blueprints.

26:09.651 --> 26:11.824
- But... I'm not an architect.

26:11.987 --> 26:13.955
I don't know how to draw out plans.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.833
This is just going to cost me
a whole lot more money.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.414
- Sir, we have to have them.

26:22.414 --> 26:26.840
- Well... okay, I'll see what I can do.

26:27.002 --> 26:28.845
- We'd appreciate that.
- Hmm...

26:29.004 --> 26:32.429
(clicks tongue)
Hmm. You have yourself a nice day.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.389
- You too.
- Hmm.

26:40.557 --> 26:41.774
Jeffrey?
- Yeah.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.438
- I'm going to put a big window right here.
- Yeah.

26:45.604 --> 26:49.199
- And, um, there'll be another one
against that wall.

26:49.358 --> 26:52.658
And one or two more small ones
along the back.

26:52.820 --> 26:53.787
- All right.

26:54.655 --> 26:57.625
You don't happen to have the dimensions
of any of these windows, do you, Gramp?

26:58.700 --> 27:00.543
- Not for the big one, no.
- No'?

27:00.702 --> 27:03.205
- I'm not sure whether I'm going to go
with a bay or not.

27:03.997 --> 27:07.092
I suppose I could commit
to where they're going right now,

27:07.251 --> 27:10.346
I mean, if we really need to.
- Yeah, we really do.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.386
Uh, any idea about doors?

27:14.341 --> 27:16.093
- Yep. We're going to have
some of those too.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.971
There's decency to be considered.

27:19.138 --> 27:21.857
- Yeah, that's hilarious, Gramp.
(Craig chuckles)

27:22.558 --> 27:24.310
- Two of them are already built.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.649
I'll have the measurements
for you in the morning.

27:28.105 --> 27:32.326
- You do realize I'm an engineer,
not an architect, right?

27:32.484 --> 27:33.656
- Oh, come on, Jeffrey.

27:34.361 --> 27:36.864
How hard could it be?

27:39.908 --> 27:41.034
. Okay-

27:43.078 --> 27:44.671
- Jeffrey?
- Yeah?

27:45.289 --> 27:49.135
- I really appreciate the help.
I know how busy you are.

27:50.919 --> 27:54.014
- Gramp, you gave me the land
for my house.

27:54.173 --> 27:57.302
In comparison, this is no big deal.
(chuckles)

27:59.344 --> 28:03.099
(announcer): The pitch is delivered and...
(crowd cheers)

28:05.893 --> 28:08.362
- Aw, jeez, they stink.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.397
- Yeah, they need a new manager.

28:12.107 --> 28:15.327
- It's not a management problem,
it's a hitting problem.

28:16.570 --> 28:19.289
- Oh well, there's always next year.

28:19.448 --> 28:22.873
- We're just into May.
The season has barely begun.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.504
Why would you say that?

28:28.999 --> 28:30.467
(sighs)

28:31.960 --> 28:33.758
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs to bed.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.424
We start on the foundation tomorrow.
- What foundation?

28:36.590 --> 28:37.716
(sigh)

28:38.967 --> 28:40.469
- For the house, Irene.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.138
Goddammit.

29:26.974 --> 29:28.442
(sigh)

29:30.978 --> 29:33.948
- You're absolutely certain
you want to do this, old man?

29:35.691 --> 29:37.068
- I sure am.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.486
Say, how's that chest cold of yours?

29:39.653 --> 29:42.076
Sure you don't need me
to work the backhoe?

29:42.239 --> 29:44.162
- Walking pneumonia, Dad.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.873
- Where I come from, if you can walk,
it's not pneumonia.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.630
- If the rest of us could rely
on strength of character

29:49.788 --> 29:53.213
instead of universal healthcare,
the world would be a better place.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.127
(chuckles)

29:56.628 --> 30:00.132
- So now, how do you want to do this?

30:00.299 --> 30:02.472
- I think we should just start in the east,
work our way back.

30:03.218 --> 30:05.391
- Well, sounds like a plan.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.272
- All right then.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.560
(grunts)

30:12.394 --> 30:14.362
(starts engine)

30:19.484 --> 30:22.704
(sighs)
- Here we go.

30:53.769 --> 30:55.817
(loud buzzing)

31:18.543 --> 31:20.136
- 'Morning, Grampy.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.172
- Well, 'morning there, Gavin.

31:22.339 --> 31:24.057
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

31:24.216 --> 31:26.059
- Summer vacation.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.721
- On. on, right.

31:29.763 --> 31:33.313
So, uh, what are your plans for today?

31:33.475 --> 31:35.523
- Don't have any.
- Ah.

31:35.685 --> 31:38.188
I hear you're pretty handy with numbers.

31:38.355 --> 31:40.073
- I guess so.

31:40.232 --> 31:43.156
- Well, I could use a good man
with a tape measure,

31:43.318 --> 31:46.572
if you think you're up to it.
- It depends.

31:47.656 --> 31:48.999
- On what?

31:49.157 --> 31:51.125
- Is this a paying job?

31:53.203 --> 31:55.501
- Depends.
- On what?

31:55.664 --> 31:57.962
- If you're any good or not.

32:11.304 --> 32:14.023
You sure this is the right length?
- I'm sure.

32:14.182 --> 32:15.684
- Good. That's what I like.

32:15.851 --> 32:20.527
A man with the confidence to measure once
and stick with it, regardless.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.863
(grunts)

32:27.112 --> 32:28.739
(exhales)

32:32.075 --> 32:34.043
(groans)
- Everything all right?

32:35.787 --> 32:38.040
- Just a little sore, that's all.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.391
(gasp)
- Oh!

32:54.181 --> 32:56.650
Dad, are you all right?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

32:57.767 --> 32:59.861
Should have braced it better.

33:00.020 --> 33:01.613
(sighs)

33:01.771 --> 33:03.318
- Why don't you let me call Darryl?

33:03.482 --> 33:05.280
He can come and he can help you.
- No.

33:05.442 --> 33:07.820
I can manage.
Your husband has enough

33:07.986 --> 33:09.283
to keep him busy on the farm.

33:09.446 --> 33:11.699
He doesn't need to be out here with me.

33:12.866 --> 33:15.369
- Farm's not going anywhere.
- Well, that makes two of us.

33:17.204 --> 33:20.378
- All of us working together,
we could finish this in two or three weeks.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.548
What?

33:27.297 --> 33:29.675
- I'm enjoying myself.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.685
I wasn't sure when I started
I still had it in me.

33:32.844 --> 33:36.098
But I don't need this to be finished
in two or three weeks.

33:37.682 --> 33:40.526
And more importantly,
neither does your mother.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.123
(kissing)

33:56.785 --> 33:59.129
- Oh, damn it!

33:59.287 --> 34:01.085
Don't you ever get bad cards?

34:01.248 --> 34:02.875
(woman chuckles)

34:03.041 --> 34:04.884
- Well played, Irene.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.045
- Come on, she got lucky, again.

34:07.963 --> 34:10.386
- Have you seen that place
they're putting up on 17?

34:10.549 --> 34:13.052
At first I thought it was a hotel,

34:13.217 --> 34:15.516
but I hear it's just for one family.

34:15.679 --> 34:17.601
- Well, how many kids do they have?

34:17.764 --> 34:19.482
- Oh hell, if that damn place
were an orphanage,

34:19.641 --> 34:21.735
they still wouldn't know
what to do with all that room.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.065
(laughter)

34:28.984 --> 34:31.282
Who's for another hand, hmm?

34:31.444 --> 34:32.911
(Chester): Yeah.
(Craig): Last one.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.165
(Chester): Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.358
(creaking)

35:20.327 --> 35:22.125
(car approaches)

35:28.293 --> 35:31.263
(hammering)

35:32.589 --> 35:35.809
- I suppose it's too much to hope
you're here on a social visit.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.641
- I don't tend to do much socializing
in St. Martins.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.932
- Now, why doesn't that surprise me?

35:42.098 --> 35:45.853
- I suspect you saw that Stop Work order
I left here yesterday.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.396
- Oh yeah.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.319
I thought that was your handiwork.

35:51.566 --> 35:53.239
- Did you understand it?

35:53.401 --> 35:55.995
- Yeah, seemed pretty straightforward to me.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.124
- Then why are you still building
without a set of approved plans?

36:00.450 --> 36:02.999
- Uh... well, that's the thing.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.505
See, the plans aren't quite ready yet.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.042
And, well, the weather is just about perfect.

36:08.208 --> 36:11.178
Jeffrey - that's my grandson -

36:11.336 --> 36:13.509
he's been kind of buried over
at the refinery.

36:13.672 --> 36:16.016
One of the distilleries went down.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.768
Otherwise, he'd have had them done by now.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.850
- But you weren't supposed to start
in the first place.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.682
I thought that was very clear.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.852
- Well, you said you needed plans.
You didn't say anything

36:27.018 --> 36:29.362
about not starting to build
before you had them.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.195
- Well, if that were the case,
what would be the point of them?

36:32.357 --> 36:34.735
(chuckles)
- Now you're talking.

36:34.901 --> 36:37.074
Those are my sentiments exactly.

36:37.237 --> 36:40.241
- Mr. Morrison, no matter what you may think,
no matter what you may believe,

36:40.407 --> 36:42.125
a building permit is not optional.

36:43.284 --> 36:46.333
And just so you and I are perfectly clear,
that Stop Work order,

36:46.496 --> 36:48.089
that's a legally binding document.
- Yeah, yeah.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.507
- Ignore it at your peril.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.095
(car door opening)

36:58.258 --> 36:59.259
(shuts car door)

37:04.556 --> 37:07.184
- "This notice shall not be removed."

37:08.059 --> 37:09.857
- Well?

37:10.895 --> 37:13.193
- Well, you want me to tell you
what you want to hear

37:13.356 --> 37:15.779
or what I think you should do?

37:17.819 --> 37:19.867
(sighs)

37:20.029 --> 37:23.078
- When did we become a country
of bureaucrats?

37:23.241 --> 37:25.460
- Look, save yourself the trouble.
It's not worth it.

37:25.618 --> 37:27.996
Just don't build
until Jeff finishes the plans.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.416
The whole thing will blow over.
- You know they're asking me

37:30.582 --> 37:33.927
to pay another $300
just to get the damn things approved.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.928
- I imagine you won't go bankrupt.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.181
Open up your wallet,

37:39.340 --> 37:42.014
welcome the moths to the 21st century.

37:42.677 --> 37:43.894
(clicks tongue)

37:45.680 --> 37:47.523
- Well, okay.

37:47.682 --> 37:51.607
If you're telling me
that's the way the world works, I'll do it.

37:52.687 --> 37:56.032
But I still feel I'm being asked to pay
for other people's mistakes.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.277
- You better put this back up.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.989
(heavy rain falling)

38:04.699 --> 38:06.292
(loud thunderclap)

38:08.036 --> 38:09.913
(drill motor whirring)

38:14.125 --> 38:15.798
(loud thunderclap)

38:18.838 --> 38:21.136
(loud thunderclap)
(quietly): Craig!

38:34.312 --> 38:36.314
- Irene? What's wrong?

38:37.315 --> 38:39.113
- Where were you?

38:39.275 --> 38:42.370
I called you, but you didn't answer.
I didn't know where you'd gone.

38:42.529 --> 38:44.782
- Easy, easy.
I told you I was in the shop.

38:44.948 --> 38:47.997
- How could I have forgotten that?
- I'm sorry.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.503
I wasn't gone that long.

38:52.247 --> 38:53.749
(quietly): Don't do that again.

38:55.166 --> 38:58.670
_ Qkay. Okay.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.377
(Chester): Well,
you better be careful up there.

39:30.535 --> 39:34.210
You know, it's my feeling
that a man over 70

39:34.372 --> 39:37.216
should never be up on a ladder
in the first place.

39:38.167 --> 39:40.761
It's tempting fate.

39:40.920 --> 39:44.675
- Chester, don't you have someplace else
you're supposed to be?

39:44.841 --> 39:47.310
(vehicle approaching)

39:47.468 --> 39:50.893
- Aw, looks like you got company.

39:51.681 --> 39:54.480
- Oh, Jesus, what now?

40:02.901 --> 40:04.949
Just stay out of it.

40:06.154 --> 40:07.121
Mr. Daigle.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.078
I thought you and I were square.

40:10.241 --> 40:11.242
- We were...

40:11.409 --> 40:13.787
until I did the framing inspection.

40:19.626 --> 40:24.553
- It says here that the wood I'm using
to frame my house is not stamped?

40:25.214 --> 40:29.344
- As noted in my report, there are a number
of building code violations.

40:29.510 --> 40:33.185
Most of them can be fixed, but I'm not sure
how you're going to remedy the fact

40:33.348 --> 40:36.101
that none of your wood was stamped
by a certified inspector.

40:36.267 --> 40:39.612
And yourjoists and trusses
were not engineer-approved.

40:45.109 --> 40:47.988
- I realize you're probably
a very busy man, Mr. Daigle.

40:49.405 --> 40:51.999
Would you mind humouring
me for a moment?

41:05.838 --> 41:07.215
In order to qualify for your job,

41:07.382 --> 41:11.933
did you have to have
any kind of expertise in lumber?

41:12.095 --> 41:14.939
Or at least a working knowledge
of the subject?

41:15.098 --> 41:18.318
- Yes, of course.
- Well then, in that case,

41:18.476 --> 41:21.605
huh... forgive me for stating the obvious
to a man of your training,

41:21.771 --> 41:25.821
but I'd hate to think
there was any kind of misunderstanding.

41:27.485 --> 41:30.455
All of the wood in this house
is old-growth spruce...

41:31.781 --> 41:35.251
that's been air-dried
for at least two years.

41:35.410 --> 41:38.630
I'd also like to point out
that there's not a single stud

41:38.788 --> 41:41.041
or sill plate that's warped or twisted.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.761
Go ahead, see for yourself.

41:44.919 --> 41:46.762
- I believe you,
I looked at them myself--

41:46.921 --> 41:49.470
- Okay, okay, so then we have
no argument there, then?

41:50.008 --> 41:53.137
Now as for the ?oor joists
and the roof trusses...

41:54.095 --> 41:56.518
I built them the way
my father taught me to build them.

41:58.766 --> 42:00.860
Do you have any idea
what he did for a living?

42:01.769 --> 42:04.192
- No, I don't.
- He was a shipwright.

42:05.148 --> 42:07.367
St. Martins was the third largest
shipbuilding centre

42:07.525 --> 42:09.448
on the Eastern Seaboard at that time.

42:10.111 --> 42:12.990
Over 500 sailing vessels
came out of those yards.

42:13.156 --> 42:16.660
So, like most of the men
who worked around here,

42:16.826 --> 42:19.079
he knew a thing or two about joinery.

42:19.704 --> 42:23.174
- I'm sure he did.
But that's not the point, sir.

42:23.332 --> 42:28.213
- Well, then, what exactly is the point, sir?

42:29.172 --> 42:33.177
- To maintain safety standards,
we need to have wood that is stamped.

42:33.718 --> 42:36.392
And I'm sorry,
but you are not an exception.

42:36.554 --> 42:39.182
- Have you not listened
to a word I said?!

42:39.348 --> 42:40.725
Look around!

42:40.892 --> 42:44.317
Take all the time you need
to evaluate my work,

42:44.479 --> 42:47.904
and then you tell me whether or not
I'm building a sound house!

42:48.733 --> 42:51.202
I paid $400 for your permit,

42:51.360 --> 42:53.579
I went to the trouble
of having plans drawn up,

42:53.738 --> 42:57.663
and now you're telling me
that my material is sub-standard?! Ha!

42:59.410 --> 43:02.835
I may not be the most sophisticated man
in the world, Mr. Daigle,

43:02.997 --> 43:04.795
but there is one thing I do know,

43:04.957 --> 43:06.584
and that's lumber.

43:07.710 --> 43:11.135
- Look, I don't have the time or patience
to argue with you,

43:11.297 --> 43:13.049
because there is zero leeway on this!

43:13.216 --> 43:16.015
Deal with the violations
or I will pull the permit

43:16.177 --> 43:18.020
and bulldoze this place.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.320
- Is that a threat?

43:28.606 --> 43:31.405
- No. It's the law.

43:37.490 --> 43:39.413
(exhales)

43:42.036 --> 43:43.333
- Not a word.

44:20.408 --> 44:21.500
Irene.

44:35.298 --> 44:36.515
(quietly): Irene...

44:49.061 --> 44:50.108
Irene...

44:55.109 --> 44:56.361
- Craig...

44:56.527 --> 44:59.531
- Don't move. Don't move.

45:40.988 --> 45:42.786
- I fell down the stairs.

45:44.575 --> 45:45.576
- Yeah, you did.

45:47.954 --> 45:49.001
How are you feeling?

45:50.373 --> 45:51.590
- Not so bad.

45:55.169 --> 45:56.386
Did I break anything?

45:58.881 --> 46:00.975
- No.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.473
- What's wrong?

46:08.933 --> 46:10.185
- Nothing.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.567
- Are you going to tell me?

46:19.527 --> 46:22.622
- I'm just worried that our luck's
beginning to run out.

46:24.282 --> 46:27.957
- No, I don't think so.

46:28.119 --> 46:31.498
- Oh really?
How do you figure that?

46:32.498 --> 46:35.798
- By all rights,
I should have broken my hip.

46:36.877 --> 46:39.596
It's got to count for something,
doesn't it?

46:50.683 --> 46:51.809
What are you doing?

46:53.144 --> 46:56.239
- Oh... Just in case you forget,
I put these gates up.

46:56.397 --> 47:00.118
- Oh... I won't forget.

47:01.235 --> 47:02.657
- Of course you won't.

47:02.820 --> 47:04.663
But... just in case.

47:04.822 --> 47:08.452
I don't think it's a good idea
for you to be on the stairs right now.

47:09.660 --> 47:13.961
Oh, and the bathroom is outside,
just for now.

47:20.046 --> 47:21.298
Where's the bathroom?

47:22.965 --> 47:24.342
- On the porch.

47:24.508 --> 47:26.181
- I love you.

47:29.805 --> 47:31.523
- My handsome man...

47:31.682 --> 47:33.025
Where are you going?

47:33.184 --> 47:35.778
- In town, for some groceries.

47:36.687 --> 47:38.064
I'm going to make us dinner tonight.

47:39.982 --> 47:42.906
- Did I bump my head or lose my mind?
You're cooking?

47:43.694 --> 47:45.412
- Well, if you can read, you can cook.

47:45.571 --> 47:48.120
That's what my father
always used to say.

47:48.282 --> 47:52.583
- Well, it's certainly taken you long enough
to test his theory out.

47:54.163 --> 47:55.289
(chuckles)

48:16.352 --> 48:17.353
- Hey, Dad.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.898
- Hi, Ruthie.
- Where's Mom?

48:21.190 --> 48:22.282
- She's taking a nap.

48:26.237 --> 48:29.912
- Is that the, uh...
porta-potty from Linda's wedding?

48:32.118 --> 48:33.119
- Yeah.

48:34.995 --> 48:36.463
- It sets the porch off nicely.

48:38.332 --> 48:40.334
- It, uh... goes well with the freezers.

48:41.419 --> 48:44.218
- Well, that's one of the advantages
of growing old.

48:45.172 --> 48:48.517
You don't care so much
about keeping up appearances.

48:52.263 --> 48:53.731
- Dad, I know what happened.

48:55.474 --> 48:57.522
My friend Jeannie's a nurse at the hospital.

48:58.644 --> 49:00.066
You should have called.

49:00.855 --> 49:02.323
- You know, I never did like Jeannie.

49:03.274 --> 49:06.869
As I remember, she was always
sticking her nose in other people's business.

49:08.612 --> 49:10.410
- Would you have told us?

49:15.911 --> 49:17.163
- No.

49:19.331 --> 49:20.332
- Why not?!

49:20.499 --> 49:23.878
- Well now, Ruthie,
don't take this personally,

49:24.587 --> 49:27.636
but I imagine that you
and your brothers and your sisters

49:27.798 --> 49:30.802
would have come to a different conclusion
about what to do next.

49:33.762 --> 49:38.188
- Well, it's been obvious for a while now
that Mom is getting worse.

49:38.350 --> 49:39.727
- You think I'm not aware of that?

49:40.978 --> 49:44.232
That's why I'm building the house.
- But a house isn't going to fix it.

49:44.398 --> 49:46.821
- No, but it will make everything
a lot more manageable.

49:46.984 --> 49:49.703
- I've been looking into some programs
that I think would be good for her.

49:49.862 --> 49:51.034
* No!

49:55.117 --> 49:56.539
It's not what your mother would want.

49:56.702 --> 49:58.420
- You haven't even heard
what I have to say!

50:00.456 --> 50:02.959
Besides, I'm not so sure she even knows
what she wants anymore.

50:07.213 --> 50:08.260
- Yes, she does.

50:19.725 --> 50:22.478
- Okay, then, if you're good here
I'll go up and see Morn.

50:26.732 --> 50:28.780
- Bed's been moved to the living room.

50:43.666 --> 50:45.043
(clears throat)

50:52.424 --> 50:53.721
- 'Afternoon, Craig.

50:54.468 --> 50:57.813
- Hello, Margaret.
Didn't expect to see you around here today.

50:57.972 --> 50:59.189
- Well, I brought you some dinner.

51:00.641 --> 51:01.608
- Who died?

51:02.977 --> 51:04.650
- I heard about Irene.

51:07.898 --> 51:08.990
- Yeah.
- I'm going to say something.

51:09.149 --> 51:10.571
I want you to hear me out.

51:11.610 --> 51:15.331
Whether you like it or not, once a week,
I'm going to be dropping off a casserole.

51:15.489 --> 51:18.117
I want my dish back.
Do you understand?

51:18.284 --> 51:21.288
- We're fine, Margaret.
Honestly.

51:22.496 --> 51:25.045
Matter of fact,
I made us a stewjust last night.

51:26.041 --> 51:28.715
- Julia Child must be rolling over
in her grave.

51:28.877 --> 51:31.380
(Sigh)
You're getting a casserole!

51:31.547 --> 51:33.424
- We don't need it.

51:33.591 --> 51:36.936
- Uh-huh. Just like we didn't need
a winter's worth of beef

51:37.094 --> 51:39.472
and all the fuel tanks filled up in '73.

51:40.222 --> 51:42.065
I'm pretty sure we'd have lost the farm

51:42.224 --> 51:44.693
and ended up in St. John
if it weren't for you.

51:44.852 --> 51:47.025
- Yeah, and Chester's been mad at me
because of it ever since.

51:48.105 --> 51:49.527
- That's Chester's problem.

51:50.524 --> 51:52.151
Look, if the roles were reversed,

51:52.318 --> 51:54.992
Irene would do the same
and you know it!

51:55.154 --> 51:58.784
Besides, I never liked you.
It's your wife I'd walk over hot coals for.

51:58.949 --> 52:01.577
(chuckles)
- Fair enough.

52:01.744 --> 52:05.169
(Irene on intercom): Craig?
Craig, are you upstairs?

52:05.331 --> 52:09.962
- Um, it's easier for me to keep track of her
when I'm out here.

52:11.420 --> 52:13.263
- We all do what we have to do.

52:13.422 --> 52:15.925
I'll go in and see her, hmm?

52:22.056 --> 52:23.979
(indistinct voices)

52:25.643 --> 52:27.691
- What if Dad has it under control?

52:27.853 --> 52:31.608
Are you completely delusional?
- Ruth, Ruth, Ruth, I'm not the enemy here.

52:31.774 --> 52:34.197
- Seriously, they're sleeping
in the living room

52:34.360 --> 52:36.579
and they're shitting on the front porch.

52:37.738 --> 52:40.662
Part of me just wants to go ahead
and hire a nurse without even asking.

52:40.824 --> 52:42.952
- Yeah, and how long do you think
that would last?

52:43.118 --> 52:44.916
- Then talk to him.
Will you just try and make him see

52:45.079 --> 52:49.129
that it's not working anymore?
- I have. He's not budging.

52:54.463 --> 52:56.591
- Why aren't we allowed to be a part of it?

52:58.175 --> 52:59.722
She's our mother.

52:59.885 --> 53:01.307
- He's her husband.

53:03.263 --> 53:06.688
And what if, in spite of what you or I think,
he's making the right decisions?

53:06.850 --> 53:09.273
- He's not.
- You can't know that!

53:09.728 --> 53:13.858
You can't be certain that you or I
have a better alternative!

53:20.280 --> 53:22.328
You know, there is another way
of looking at this.

53:22.491 --> 53:24.914
- Mm-hmm.
What's that?

53:25.077 --> 53:27.671
- If he was asking us
to tuck him in at night,

53:27.830 --> 53:30.674
we'd be phoning Brock Reid
and telling him to warm up the hearse.

53:42.344 --> 53:44.722
- And until then?

53:46.140 --> 53:47.767
(sighs)

53:47.933 --> 53:50.903
- Guess we hope he doesn't give them both
food poisoning.

54:02.865 --> 54:05.414
- Are you awake?

54:07.119 --> 54:08.666
-lam.

54:11.248 --> 54:13.501
- Why is our bed in the living room?

54:17.713 --> 54:20.933
- Because you fell down the stairs last week.

54:22.551 --> 54:24.724
- Did I hurt myself?

54:24.887 --> 54:28.266
- No, mm-mm.
Nothing serious.

54:30.267 --> 54:32.986
- It's funny, I can't remember it at all.

54:38.859 --> 54:41.988
- Well, you bumped your head.

54:43.030 --> 54:45.203
Probably has something to do with it.

54:45.365 --> 54:47.709
- Still, I should remember, shouldn't I?

54:51.371 --> 54:52.497
- I wouldn't worry about it.

54:54.082 --> 54:57.131
- But I am worried.

55:00.255 --> 55:02.383
(sighs)

55:06.136 --> 55:10.061
- So you can't remember
a couple of things, so what?

55:11.475 --> 55:13.102
We're still here.

55:14.937 --> 55:16.689
We have each other.

55:17.731 --> 55:19.904
And isn't everything else a bonus?

55:21.193 --> 55:23.070
- I hope so.

55:26.406 --> 55:28.875
You know what scares me?

55:29.910 --> 55:31.503
- No, what?

55:32.120 --> 55:36.000
- What if I forget everything?

55:40.838 --> 55:42.431
- You'll still be my Irene.

55:45.467 --> 55:47.720
(chuckles)

55:49.221 --> 55:50.438
- Promise?

55:52.933 --> 55:55.482
- I've never broken a promise to you yet.

55:59.940 --> 56:01.783
But you almost did.

56:04.945 --> 56:07.539
With Bernice... what's-her-name?

56:08.740 --> 56:11.209
(sighs)
- Punchard.

56:12.202 --> 56:14.375
Bernice Punchard.

56:14.538 --> 56:18.543
But my darling heart,
she was an extraordinary woman.

56:22.546 --> 56:24.594
- How close did you two come?

56:26.383 --> 56:30.229
- You know, jealousy has never been
one of your more endearing qualities.

56:30.387 --> 56:32.515
- Jealousy has nothing to do with it.
- Uh-huh.

56:33.390 --> 56:36.894
- I would have left you so fast
if I ever caught you with another woman.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.903
- So I've been told...

56:40.898 --> 56:43.697
So I've been told.

56:43.859 --> 56:46.328
- Can we go to sleep now?

56:46.486 --> 56:47.612
- I still will.

56:50.198 --> 56:51.245
- What?

56:52.200 --> 56:54.453
- Leave you if you cheat on me.

56:54.620 --> 56:56.839
- Oh, Jesus.

56:58.415 --> 57:02.136
Okay, okay.
Now let it go.

57:04.129 --> 57:09.101
- So whatever happened to...
lovely Bernice what's-her-name?

57:10.010 --> 57:11.432
- Punchard.

57:12.721 --> 57:16.396
She died 30 years ago.

57:19.144 --> 57:20.236
- That's terrible.

57:22.064 --> 57:23.987
Now I feel awful.

57:25.525 --> 57:26.868
- So you should.

57:29.279 --> 57:31.373
You're a mean woman.

57:31.531 --> 57:33.329
(laughter)

57:44.294 --> 57:46.968
- ...and, in fact, Mr. Morrison's done

57:47.130 --> 57:49.224
exactly the opposite of what
the Commission is suggesting.

57:49.383 --> 57:52.478
He's tried to address
every single one of their concerns.

57:54.054 --> 57:57.228
He hired Mr. Folkin,
an accredited wood inspector.

57:57.391 --> 57:59.860
Found absolutely no fault
with the lumber

58:00.018 --> 58:02.612
and stamped it as such on 30 June.

58:02.771 --> 58:06.821
He enlisted Jeff LeBlanc,
a certified engineer,

58:06.984 --> 58:09.783
to redraw the joists and truss specs.

58:09.945 --> 58:12.539
And Mr. Morrison's already added
the reinforcements

58:12.698 --> 58:14.917
to comply with the Commission's
recommendations.

58:15.075 --> 58:17.248
These are the photos
of those improvements.

58:17.411 --> 58:20.961
Additionally,
Mr. Raymond Debley -

58:21.123 --> 58:22.545
you'll recognize that name, Mr. Daigle -

58:22.708 --> 58:25.382
one of the most successful
and respected builders

58:25.544 --> 58:29.139
in New Brunswick
inspected the house on 10 July

58:29.297 --> 58:31.846
and those are his findings.

58:32.009 --> 58:35.604
As you'll read, it's quite a glowing report
of Mr. Morrison's construction.

58:39.057 --> 58:40.434
- Is that all, Mr. Fulton?

58:41.393 --> 58:42.360
- Yeah...

58:44.271 --> 58:46.148
Except, sorry, uh...

58:46.314 --> 58:48.783
You know, it's worth remembering
that the National Building code

58:48.942 --> 58:53.539
is not a set of rules,
it's a set of standards.

58:53.697 --> 58:57.543
And it's our belief that Mr. Morrison's
not only met those standards, but...

58:58.535 --> 59:00.537
in most cases, he's exceeded them.

59:09.921 --> 59:12.424
- It is the opinion
of the Building Department

59:12.591 --> 59:14.810
that Mr. Morrison
has still not satisfied

59:14.968 --> 59:17.391
the concerns raised by the inspection
of his house.

59:20.098 --> 59:22.726
Therefore, until such time
that a workable solution

59:22.893 --> 59:26.193
to all 26 violations has been accepted,

59:26.354 --> 59:29.073
the Stop Work order is still in effect.

59:31.902 --> 59:34.200
Make no mistake, Mr. Morrison,

59:34.362 --> 59:37.161
violating a Stop Work order
is a serious of fence

59:37.324 --> 59:39.998
and will force us
to take further legal action.

59:43.246 --> 59:44.589
Do you understand?

59:47.375 --> 59:49.878
(sighs)
- Jesus, what a mess.

59:51.463 --> 59:53.261
- You ever wonder if their minds
are already made up?

59:53.423 --> 59:56.893
That no matter what we propose,
the answer will still be the same?

59:57.052 --> 01:00:01.523
- Well... they just have to come around,
that's all.

01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:05.276
Nothing else makes any sense.

01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:11.859
I got enough work in the shop
what with the doors and the trim and all.

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:15.450
I suppose I could keep going
for at least a couple of weeks.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:16.738
- Sure.

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:22.294
- Hopefully, by then,
the wind will have shifted in our favour.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:33.760
(crickets chirping)

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:39.019
(radio): ...at 11,542.58,
a fourteen-month low.

01:00:39.177 --> 01:00:42.431
In the energy sector,
crude is down 13%

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:44.395
from just six weeks ago.
- You hear that?

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:48.316
I sure hope the refinery
doesn't shut down.

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:52.319
Jeff's carrying far too much debt
for that to happen.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.860
- ...and the third month in a row
that auto sales

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:56.573
are below last year's levels

01:00:56.736 --> 01:00:59.785
all point to the possibility
of a double-dip recession

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:01.245
triggered largely by the subprime...

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:05.079
(sighing)

01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:08.090
(loud buzzing)

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:18.263
- Irene?
(door closing)

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.686
Irene?

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:32.860
Irene?!

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:36.113
(clucking)
Irene?

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:40.246
Irene?

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:56.763
Hey, Dana, did you happen to see Irene
out and about today?

01:01:56.922 --> 01:02:00.142
- No, I can't say that I have.
- Huh...

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:41.224
I don't think I've seen you smoke
in 5O years.

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:44.345
- You haven't?

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:46.767
- No.

01:02:49.057 --> 01:02:50.775
Where'd you get the cigarettes?

01:02:54.479 --> 01:02:55.526
- I don't know.

01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:58.066
Isn't that funny?

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:03.617
- I was worried about you.

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:07.951
I went back to the house
and you weren't there.

01:03:09.286 --> 01:03:11.004
I've been looking for you for hours.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:12.793
- I'm sorry.

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:16.505
Didn't I tell you I was going out for a walk?

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.591
We should come down to the beach
more often.

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:25.806
C'est beau.

01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:31.065
- Yeah, maybe we should.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:38.815
- Craig, look.

01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:44.659
Someone's building a new house.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.495
- Oh, they picked a nice spot for it.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:50.831
- Oh, they'll have a beautiful view
of the bay.

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:54.673
Something I wish we'd have had.

01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:19.147
(crickets chirping)

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:33.870
- Irene.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.708
Irene.
- Mm?

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:40.923
- I'm sorry, honey,
I can't let you stay out here.

01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:42.087
(moaning)

01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:45.006
It's... it's too cold.
- My legs hurt.

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:04.739
- Come on, come on.
(groans)

01:05:11.324 --> 01:05:12.541
- Oh!
- I gotcha.

01:05:24.129 --> 01:05:27.599
- No. No. I'm staying.
I'm staying out here.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:29.100
- Irene, come on.

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:31.978
Those same legs got you into town
just fine today.

01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:36.608
- No! No! No! No!

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:40.361
No! No! No!

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:44.737
I'm sleeping... right here.

01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:48.278
- Oh, Jesus, really?! Now?!

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:55.664
You can't do that and you know it.
Now come on. Come on, let's go.

01:05:55.827 --> 01:05:58.296
- Get your damn hands off me!

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.671
- Irene, please.
(snarling)

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:05.258
Ow! Goddammit!
That hurt!

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.138
Come on! Now, come on!

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:11.642
- Hey! Let me go!
- No. Come on.

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:12.723
(yelling)

01:06:12.886 --> 01:06:15.355
Come on. No.
- Let me go!

01:06:15.513 --> 01:06:17.811
- No! No!
(yelling)

01:06:35.283 --> 01:06:37.411
(distant crickets chirping)

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:44.250
(gasp)
(thud)

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:45.669
Oh!

01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:03.353
(sighs)
Every night I would make sure

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.022
there was nothing on the floor.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.192
I forget once.

01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:14.080
She trips over her damn shoe.

01:07:14.239 --> 01:07:16.458
(John): Hey, Dad, could have been anything.

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:19.877
- I was mad at her.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.290
We had a fight.

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:26.839
She wanted to sleep out on the front lawn,
I wouldn't let her.

01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:33.474
I dragged her into the house.

01:07:37.095 --> 01:07:39.974
- I mean, you had to get her inside.
- No, I didn't.

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:42.066
Not like that.

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:47.569
You don't... drag someone.

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:07.091
- Roses?

01:08:10.461 --> 01:08:12.429
- They're from an admirer.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:24.818
- You never bought me roses,
never before.

01:08:25.727 --> 01:08:27.854
- You never broke your hip before.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.236
- I broke my hip?

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.109
How?

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:38.868
- Because your husband is a fool.

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.975
(man): The surgery went very well.

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:00.728
(Craig): So when can she come home?

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:02.981
- We'll keep her here for a few more days,

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:07.609
then she'll be moved to the rehab wing
for four to six weeks of therapy.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.404
- Four to six weeks?

01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:17.863
- Your son and daughter have told me
a bit about your situation.

01:09:19.113 --> 01:09:23.788
Mr. Morrison, your wife
will require some follow-up therapy.

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:25.624
And some home care.

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:29.299
Now, given her physical
and mental health, I...

01:09:30.625 --> 01:09:33.002
I don't foresee a time
when it would stop altogether.

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:44.138
. Okay-

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:48.852
- You comfortable with that, Dad?

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:52.397
- Your mother and I
have been together 61 years.

01:09:54.565 --> 01:09:57.819
Never spent more
than a handful of nights apart.

01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:01.030
But...

01:10:02.824 --> 01:10:04.371
if that's the way it's got to be...

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:08.421
then that's the way it is.

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:17.798
(sighs)

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:27.440
(sighs)

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:42.660
(Craig): I realize you and I son' of
got off on the wrong foot...

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.413
but, uh...

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:50.079
this doesn't have to get personal.

01:10:52.874 --> 01:10:54.091
(sighs)

01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:56.298
I apologize.

01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:59.760
I... I didn't mean any disrespect.

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:04.302
- You have certain... violations
against your house.

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:10.476
- Could you please tell me what to do
and I'll do it.

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:14.612
- Mr. Morrison, this office
does not have the resources to spend

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:17.866
to teach people the fundamentals
of how to build.

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:22.495
They either know how to do it
or they hire someone who does.

01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:30.245
You've seen my report.
You know what needs to be done.

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.298
(Craig): Yes, I do.

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:17.584
(Craig): Are you sleeping, okay?

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.752
(Irene): No. You?

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:22.634
- No. Not really.

01:12:24.465 --> 01:12:28.220
(saw buzzing)
Remember when we met?

01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:30.347
- Yes, of course.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:33.391
You were drunk.

01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:37.529
- No, not drunk, tipsy.

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:40.156
- You threw up on my sister, Pierrette.

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:43.067
- I ate something that didn't agree with me.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:45.740
- Flask of whiskey is what you ate.

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:48.206
- Oh...

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:49.365
Yeah.

01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:53.328
She and I never did get back
on solid ground after that.

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:56.168
- My sister, Pierrette, was an elephant

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:59.379
when it came to remembering slights
against her.

01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:04.639
I don't blame her.
It's a beautiful dress you ruined.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:07.641
She missed the rest of the dance...

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.802
(Irene laughing)
...and her best friend ended up

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:13.644
marrying the boy
she was hoping to enchant that night.

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:17.686
- Is that why she was a spinster?
- Mm-hmm. 'Cause you threw up on her.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:23.070
- Gee... I'd hate me too.

01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:29.076
What do you think would have happened to us
if we'd never met?

01:13:30.615 --> 01:13:33.539
Or if I'd thrown up on you instead?

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:37.212
- Oh, we probably would have found
someone else.

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:40.754
- You think?

01:13:41.542 --> 01:13:43.135
* No!

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:47.845
- But the law's the law, am I right?
I mean, that's...

01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:51.261
Oh, here he is now.

01:13:57.683 --> 01:14:00.152
You're treading in dangerous waters,
my friend.

01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:05.112
- 'Morning, Owen, Marty.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:06.651
What are you on about, Chester?

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:10.705
- I couldn't help noticing
you started building again.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:14.367
Seems pretty clear
you're asking for a whole heap of trouble.

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:18.083
- Well, thanks for the legal advice, Chester.

01:14:18.245 --> 01:14:20.498
You charge by the hour?

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:23.418
- The Building Department
bulldozed a house in Upperton

01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:26.178
last month for pretty much
the same damn thing!

01:14:26.337 --> 01:14:31.639
Owning 2,000 acres
doesn't put you above the law, Craig.

01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:33.678
- Goddammit, Chester,

01:14:33.844 --> 01:14:36.222
that's got nothing to do with it.

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:39.184
For once in your life,

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:41.478
why don't you mind
your own goddamn business?

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:08.596
(knocking)
- Anybody in there?

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:10.506
- Hold on, I'll be with you in a second.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:18.435
- Are you Mr. G. Craig Morrison?

01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:20.599
- I am.
- You've been served.

01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:22.894
(clucking)

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:55.973
(Craig): Do you remember
when I built our dining room table?

01:15:58.179 --> 01:16:00.932
(Irene): We'd been using a sawhorse
and planks for so many years, I...

01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:06.271
I had all but given up
on ever getting a proper one.

01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:08.155
- My father helped me
mill the boards.

01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:12.902
I put 12 coats of finish on that table.

01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:16.990
- Which still didn't help
when Ruth spilt ink on it.

01:16:18.866 --> 01:16:20.960
- Oh, I wasn't that upset.

01:16:21.118 --> 01:16:25.464
- Ha! You were very table-proud back then.

01:16:25.623 --> 01:16:29.548
- No.
It's a very nice piece of carpentry.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.844
<i>Do you know how much</i> a <i>harvest table
would have cost you in</i> a <i>store?</i>

01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:35.849
(laughing)

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.433
The first few years...

01:16:40.096 --> 01:16:42.019
<i>every nick that table absorbed...</i>

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:45.267
I took it personally.

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:46.606
It's all I could see.

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:51.232
The dent from a fork,
scratch from a skate blade...

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:57.701
the ghost of someone's handwriting
pressed through a single piece of paper.

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:00.367
- I forgot about that.

01:17:01.367 --> 01:17:03.745
- I mean, how hard can it be
for a kid to remember

01:17:03.911 --> 01:17:06.630
to put a few extra sheets
under their homework?

01:17:10.334 --> 01:17:15.511
Well, there were a lot of times I regretted
not making that table out of oak.

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:21.103
But... as the years went by

01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:24.641
and... the scars added up...

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:29.395
the imperfections turned that tab/e
into something else.

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:37.074
That's the thing about pine...

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.581
holds a lot of memories.

01:18:09.602 --> 01:18:11.525
- 'Morning, Craig.
- Gary...

01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:16.238
- Seems like you've been busy.
- That I have.

01:18:16.775 --> 01:18:21.030
- Tried to call,
but there was... no answer.

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:23.541
Did they serve you yesterday?
- Oh yeah.

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:26.794
Seems like there's a first time
for everything.

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:30.961
- You understand you're going to have
to appear in court on Tuesday?

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:32.924
- I certainly do.

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:36.754
- Craig, they're remarkably mad at you.

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:42.594
If we're going to have a chance of winning,
you've got to stop building.

01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:50.442
- Irene broke her hip, Gary.

01:18:50.935 --> 01:18:54.189
- What?
- She'll have to get around with a walker.

01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:59.110
Our old house doesn't work anymore.

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:01.203
- I'm sorry.

01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:05.120
Why didn't you tell me you started again?

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:08.369
- Well, I...

01:19:09.328 --> 01:19:12.377
I just didn't want to risk you
talking me out of it,

01:19:12.539 --> 01:19:14.633
convincing me there was a better way.

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:16.544
- No, I couldn't convince you.

01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:19.964
- Oh, at that point, yeah,
maybe you could have.

01:19:20.881 --> 01:19:24.431
At least now, whatever happens,

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:27.312
it'll be finished by the time
lrene's ready to come home.

01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:33.311
- Not hungry?

01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:35.778
- No.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:39.116
Don't seem to have much of an appetite
these days.

01:19:44.321 --> 01:19:46.619
(sighs)
I should get going.

01:19:46.782 --> 01:19:49.911
I've got to get to the hospital
before visiting hours are over.

01:19:52.538 --> 01:19:54.632
- You look beat, Dad.
Why don't you take the night off?

01:19:57.418 --> 01:19:59.796
- No, she's expecting me.

01:20:01.338 --> 01:20:04.683
(phone rings)

01:20:08.595 --> 01:20:09.596
- I'll get it.

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:18.234
Hello.

01:20:20.774 --> 01:20:23.152
Uh, just a second.

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:36.256
- Hello?

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.053
Speaking.

01:20:41.211 --> 01:20:44.681
- My name is Marty Klinkenberg,
with the Telegraph Journal.

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:50.012
(sighs)

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:53.683
- I already have a subscription
to your newspaper.

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:55.817
- Uh, no, it's not about that.

01:20:55.976 --> 01:20:59.697
I'm a reporter and I heard
you might be having a few problems

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:01.607
with the Building Department.

01:21:01.774 --> 01:21:05.028
(chuckles)
- Well, that would be a gross understatement.

01:21:06.236 --> 01:21:09.035
Say, how did you ever hear
about a case like mine, anyway?

01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:12.869
Must seem like small potatoes
to most people.

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:14.002
- It's funny.

01:21:14.161 --> 01:21:17.540
One of your neighbours, Chester Jones,
started phoning me about two weeks ago.

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:20.004
He kept calling till I had no choice

01:21:20.167 --> 01:21:22.886
but to look into the matter
just to get him off my back.

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:26.632
- Chester?
Chester Jones?

01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:28.972
Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:31.432
Do you have time for a few questions?

01:21:35.307 --> 01:21:36.354
- Yeah.

01:21:37.851 --> 01:21:39.023
Yeah, sure.

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:13.224
" Dad?
" Huh?

01:22:14.388 --> 01:22:15.560
- Are you all right?

01:22:19.143 --> 01:22:22.022
(groaning)

01:22:32.573 --> 01:22:33.950
(groaning)

01:22:36.243 --> 01:22:37.586
(groaning)

01:22:40.914 --> 01:22:42.632
- How are you feeling?
- Oh...

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:44.797
everything aches.

01:22:47.463 --> 01:22:50.512
This may be the start of my slow decline.

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:52.509
- Well, it's about time.

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:55.350
(laughing)
Can I get you anything?

01:22:58.390 --> 01:22:59.983
- I need to tell you something.

01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:06.740
- All right.

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:14.453
- The Babe Ruth baseball is
in the kitchen cupboard in an old flour tin.

01:23:18.535 --> 01:23:19.627
- Uh...

01:23:20.704 --> 01:23:22.752
Yeah, I already knew that.

01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:26.377
Mom told us.

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:29.842
- Jesus.

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:33.225
Your mother never could keep a secret.

01:23:34.635 --> 01:23:37.980
(chuckles)
I got a call last year.

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:42.730
A guy offered me $40,000 for that ball.

01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:44.853
Can you imagine?

01:23:46.146 --> 01:23:48.945
$40,000 for a baseball.

01:23:51.401 --> 01:23:54.075
- All these years,
were you ever tempted to sell it?

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:56.490
- Mm, sure.

01:23:58.158 --> 01:24:01.002
The thought crossed my mind
once or twice.

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:04.085
- So why didn't you?

01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:08.343
- I sleep better knowing it's still there...

01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:12.556
in case I ever get myself
in a really tight squeeze.

01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:28.230
- Well, I tried to get them to postpone,
but... they're not budging.

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:31.658
Have you seen the Telegraph-Journal
yet today?

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:34.912
- Uh, no, no. Why?

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:37.414
- Well, your father made the front page.

01:24:46.206 --> 01:24:47.128
(knocking)

01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:48.759
- Hi.

01:24:50.961 --> 01:24:52.508
- I've been looking for you.

01:24:52.671 --> 01:24:54.218
- Have you?

01:24:56.216 --> 01:24:57.638
- Where were you?

01:24:58.468 --> 01:25:00.345
- I came this morning.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:02.731
Wasn't supposed to be back till tonight.

01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:05.017
- Came from where?

01:25:05.183 --> 01:25:06.651
- The house.

01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:10.481
- What house?

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.327
- Hmm...

01:25:17.904 --> 01:25:18.905
It doesn't matter.

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:24.870
How was your day?

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:29.841
- Fine.

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:42.353
(phone rings)

01:25:44.348 --> 01:25:45.349
- Hello?

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.151
(Margaret): Chester died.

01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:52.023
- Oh...

01:25:58.153 --> 01:25:59.200
Oh, Margaret...

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:02.408
I'm so sorry.

01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:13.923
(Irene): Are you praying?

01:26:16.546 --> 01:26:18.173
(CTai9)I Trying to.

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:22.178
- Since when did you get religion?

01:26:24.429 --> 01:26:25.976
- I'm not sure I have yet,

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:30.193
but I figure this might be
a good time to hedge my bets.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:33.530
- For what?

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:38.861
- I don't know.

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:42.122
A miracle, I suppose.

01:26:45.617 --> 01:26:47.665
- I've... I've missed you.

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:52.211
- I miss you too.

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:58.050
How you doing?

01:27:01.425 --> 01:27:02.642
- I've been better.

01:27:09.599 --> 01:27:13.649
- Yeah... me too.

01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:56.396
- Hey, Dad.

01:27:56.563 --> 01:27:58.361
- Ruthie.

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:01.910
(sighs)

01:28:02.068 --> 01:28:05.242
- I, uh... stopped by
the new house last night.

01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:14.794
You and Morn are going to like it there.

01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:18.926
- You think?

01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:23.925
- Yeah. Definitely.

01:28:24.716 --> 01:28:26.138
- Hmm.

01:28:29.095 --> 01:28:30.768
- You planned it out well.

01:28:31.932 --> 01:28:32.933
- Thanks.

01:28:35.685 --> 01:28:38.234
I sure hope so.

01:28:59.626 --> 01:29:01.674
Gary, I want to ask you something.

01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:05.181
How long have you been my lawyer?

01:29:06.716 --> 01:29:08.593
- Twenty-six and one half years.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:12.014
- And would it be fair to say
that you've done as much work for me

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.558
on this case as you have
in all those years combined?

01:29:14.724 --> 01:29:17.068
- Probably, yeah. More, maybe.

01:29:17.227 --> 01:29:20.356
- So, uh... why haven't I gotten a bill yet?

01:29:21.064 --> 01:29:22.611
- Well, that's a good question.

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:25.277
Since you know, I make it a practice
never to work for free,

01:29:25.443 --> 01:29:30.825
but... Craig, I've misread
this situation consistently,

01:29:30.991 --> 01:29:34.040
given you the wrong advice throughout.

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:37.206
This whole mess may be
just as much my fault as it is yours.

01:29:37.914 --> 01:29:40.008
It doesn't sit right to have you pay
for my mistakes.

01:29:41.126 --> 01:29:43.049
- Do you really think,
if you hadn't made those mistakes,

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:45.305
things would have turned out differently?

01:29:46.965 --> 01:29:48.888
- No.
- Me neither.

01:29:51.761 --> 01:29:54.264
Look, if it's all the same to you,

01:29:54.431 --> 01:30:00.234
once you finish your arguments,
do you think I could say a few words?

01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:01.897
- Losing faith in me?

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:03.906
(chuckles)
- It's too late now.

01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:08.411
No, there's just some things
I'd like to get off my chest, win or lose.

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:10.747
- What's this?

01:30:11.448 --> 01:30:15.328
- It's a deed to five acres of land.

01:30:16.369 --> 01:30:20.374
Just about the nicest that I have,
not counting my own, of course.

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:22.292
- It's got my name on it. Why?

01:30:23.335 --> 01:30:25.212
" Why not?

01:30:27.756 --> 01:30:29.850
Are you a baseball fan,
Your Honour?

01:30:34.054 --> 01:30:35.271
- Excuse me?

01:30:36.181 --> 01:30:38.275
- I've been one all my life.

01:30:38.391 --> 01:30:41.190
I've always appreciated
how you could compare a player

01:30:41.353 --> 01:30:44.857
in one era to a player from another,

01:30:46.024 --> 01:30:48.994
how what Babe Ruth
was able to accomplish

01:30:49.152 --> 01:30:54.124
is just as understandable
and awesome right now

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:56.284
as it was back in the day.

01:30:57.619 --> 01:31:01.294
How the traditions of the game
have been maintained through the years.

01:31:02.374 --> 01:31:06.629
There's a... kind of religion of the rules.

01:31:08.421 --> 01:31:11.891
And, just like in baseball,

01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:14.894
I've always believed
in the tradition of building...

01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:18.314
and the religion of rules.

01:31:22.477 --> 01:31:25.697
My father taught me
how to see lumber in a living tree.

01:31:27.107 --> 01:31:31.829
Truth in a wall that was plumb
or a corner that was square.

01:31:37.117 --> 01:31:39.336
I don't mean to put myself above the law,

01:31:41.204 --> 01:31:43.502
and I never have...

01:31:45.125 --> 01:31:46.502
until now.

01:31:49.587 --> 01:31:51.510
I'm too old for this nonsense.

01:31:53.466 --> 01:31:55.139
My house is sound.

01:31:57.303 --> 01:32:00.523
My wife is due to get out of the hospital
next week, and, uh...

01:32:01.975 --> 01:32:03.352
options are limited.

01:32:05.603 --> 01:32:07.276
We're going to move into our house.

01:32:09.566 --> 01:32:10.567
So...

01:32:12.485 --> 01:32:16.160
it looks like... either I'm going to jail...

01:32:18.324 --> 01:32:19.951
or I'm going home.

01:32:22.912 --> 01:32:27.167
Either way, I can sleep
with a clear conscience.

01:32:32.672 --> 01:32:34.595
(soft music)

01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:42.307

01:32:45.268 --> 01:32:48.397

01:32:48.563 --> 01:32:50.986

01:35:39.901 --> 01:35:41.903
(chuckles)

01:35:47.283 --> 01:35:49.456
(crickets chirping)

01:35:49.619 --> 01:35:53.499
You know, I'd have been way ahead
of the game if I'd just gone ahead

01:35:53.665 --> 01:35:56.134
and built that house
without ever asking for a permit.

01:35:56.292 --> 01:35:59.387
- Yeah, and I would have been
much happier

01:35:59.545 --> 01:36:01.513
if I'd just stuck you in an old folks home.

01:36:02.507 --> 01:36:06.512
- That's funny, I was just about to propose
the same thing to you.

01:36:06.678 --> 01:36:08.851
I could check into some options,
if you don't mind.

01:36:09.013 --> 01:36:11.107
- Yeah, we should go in together
and get a group rate.

01:36:11.266 --> 01:36:13.644
(chuckles)
- Now you're talking.

01:36:14.978 --> 01:36:16.070
- So...

01:36:18.356 --> 01:36:20.233
you got another project in mind?

01:36:22.902 --> 01:36:24.620
- Maybe.

01:36:25.697 --> 01:36:27.040
- Do you want to talk about it?

01:36:27.198 --> 01:36:28.825
- No.

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:31.919
- Is it big?

01:36:33.288 --> 01:36:34.631
- Might be.

01:36:35.373 --> 01:36:38.718
(sighs)
- Jesus, Dad.

01:36:42.297 --> 01:36:44.971
- What else do you want me to do,
sit around all day?

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:47.101
Time enough for that when I'm dead.

01:37:00.231 --> 01:37:02.450
(door opens)

01:37:02.608 --> 01:37:04.235
(door closes)

01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:15.709
- Oh...

01:37:16.414 --> 01:37:18.792
look at this hair.

01:37:21.753 --> 01:37:23.847
How long since your last haircut?

01:37:25.048 --> 01:37:27.050
- Oh, it's... it's been a while.

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:42.611
- The usual?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:38:01.501 --> 01:38:02.878
Irene?

01:38:05.755 --> 01:38:09.305
- Yes?
- Are you cutting my hair?

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:12.891
- Of course.

01:38:15.556 --> 01:38:16.899
Look at this hair.

01:38:19.435 --> 01:38:21.733
How long since your last haircut?

01:38:24.065 --> 01:38:25.362
- It's been a while.

01:38:27.902 --> 01:38:29.279
It's been a while.
