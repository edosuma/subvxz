00:06.640 --> 00:07.741
- In the criminal justice
system, sexually based offenses

00:09.643 --> 00:12.146
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.146 --> 00:14.515
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.515 --> 00:16.884
who investigate these vicious
felonies are members

00:16.884 --> 00:19.853
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.722
These are their stories.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.966
Shorty, where your mommy at?

02:16.637 --> 02:19.407
- So that wasn't as horrible
as I thought.

02:19.407 --> 02:20.808
- You're gonna be
a lieutenant.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.576
You need to practice
kissing those rings.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.011
- Lieutenant?

02:24.011 --> 02:25.246
So I passed.

02:25.246 --> 02:28.249
- And then some.

02:28.249 --> 02:31.452
When it's official, you can pick
any command in the city.

02:31.452 --> 02:32.786
- I'm happy where I am.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.689
- Okay.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.858
You up for a nightcap?

02:37.858 --> 02:39.360
We need to talk about
finding you a number two.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.796
Don't you ever
turn that thing off?

02:42.796 --> 02:45.999
- I can't.
We're short staffed.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.837
Benson.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.038
Okay.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.606
Yeah, I'm on my way.

02:52.606 --> 02:55.343
- Where to?
I'll drive.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.751
- Liv, Chief,
sorry to break up your date.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.886
- That wasn't a date.
- It wasn't a date.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.756
- Detective Campisi and I
took this from patrol.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.424
Our sergeant suggested SVU

03:10.424 --> 03:12.260
would be better equipped
to handle a lost kid.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.262
- In other words,
he passed the buck.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.264
- Little boy won't talk.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.432
Not even a name.
Walked in here all by himself.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.375
- Where the hell
are the parents?

03:27.375 --> 03:28.676
- That's why we're here.

04:24.332 --> 04:24.665

04:25.466 --> 04:28.536
Huh? You like the bus?

04:28.536 --> 04:30.871
The bus goes
"vroom, vroom," right?

04:30.871 --> 04:33.507
Can you say that?

04:33.507 --> 04:35.443
Hey, let's try our game again.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.578

04:37.578 --> 04:41.382
So I'm Olivia and you are?

Remember, you are?

04:45.453 --> 04:47.455
You are?

04:47.455 --> 04:51.091
- Bruno.
- Bruno.

04:51.091 --> 04:54.795
Bruno, what's your last name,
sweetie?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.364
- Bruno.

04:56.364 --> 04:59.266
- So Bruno, how old are you?

04:59.266 --> 05:00.834
Huh?

05:00.834 --> 05:02.169
Are you this many?

05:02.169 --> 05:03.871
Hmm?

05:03.871 --> 05:05.473
You this many?

05:06.807 --> 05:07.975
Hey.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.177
Okay, sweetie,
I'll be back

05:10.177 --> 05:12.212
in one second, okay?

05:14.047 --> 05:16.650
- Any luck, Sergeant Benson?
- Just his first name.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.051
I mean, he's gotta be
three years old, right?

05:18.051 --> 05:20.053
Shouldn't he be talking by now?

05:20.053 --> 05:21.288
- Delayed speech.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.656
I mean, I'm not surprised.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.291
No one's taking care of him.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.860
He was filthy,
several cavities.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.830
Vitamin D levels were low,
so he's not getting out much.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.966
- Okay, so he's neglected,
but any abuse?

05:32.966 --> 05:36.069
- No broken bones
or any signs of sexual trauma.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.406
- Good.
- But I want to run

05:38.406 --> 05:40.474
some more tests, and I'd like
to talk to the parents.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.576
- Well, so would we.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.845
Thank you.

05:48.649 --> 05:52.553
- The way you're carrying,
that's a girl.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.855
- Yeah, so you were saying
you'd seen Bruno around?

05:54.855 --> 05:57.991
- In this courtyard,
all hours.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.427
No one watching him.

05:59.427 --> 06:02.430
I called 911, 311.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.831
Nothing.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.666
- What about the mother?

06:05.666 --> 06:07.435
- That girl is a mess.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.637
All hopped up.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.805
- Excuse me,
is that your son?

06:11.805 --> 06:13.006
He's cute.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.843
- I know you?

06:17.344 --> 06:21.281
- Have you seen this boy
around here?

06:21.281 --> 06:24.452
- I guess, with his mom
sometimes.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.153
- Well, does his mom
have a name?

06:26.153 --> 06:28.622
- Manuela something.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.857
Like a baseball player name.

06:29.857 --> 06:32.025
One of them Dominican brothers.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.597
- Who taught you
how to slide?

06:36.597 --> 06:39.266
- Look, man,
I'm not holding.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.134
- What are you, a lookout?

06:41.134 --> 06:42.536
Looking for this kid's mother.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.104
You know him?

06:44.104 --> 06:45.673
- Look, I don't know the kid

06:45.673 --> 06:46.974
or his mother.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.109
You know what?

06:49.109 --> 06:51.111
My name's Tito Morales,

06:51.111 --> 06:52.345
and I'm recording
the rest of this.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.682
- Hey, Tito, keep snitching

06:54.682 --> 06:57.117
and we'll drop those charges
against you.

06:57.117 --> 06:58.619
- Come on, man,
I'm no snitch.

06:58.619 --> 07:02.289
- Then start talking.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.257
- We are all over it.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.793
Uh, that was Dodds.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.695
He's asking about Bruno.
What can I tell him?

07:07.695 --> 07:10.498
- Local runner told me his mom's
been copping once a day.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.632
He'll call when she shows.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.101
- You get a name?
- Manuela.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.537
Last name could be Ortiz,
Organda, Ordano.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.871
It's something Dominican.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.973
- You talk to the housing
authority?

07:19.973 --> 07:21.308
- They're checking,
but my contact there

07:21.308 --> 07:22.743
said not to expect much.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.211
He's gotta go through
2,000 leases.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.779
- Yeah, not to mention
illegal sublets,

07:25.779 --> 07:27.815
hot beds, roommates.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.918
- So Manuela's strung out,
and Bruno is home alone.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.419
Did you run their names
through Child Services?

07:32.419 --> 07:33.721
- Yeah, I called them.
Without a last name,

07:33.721 --> 07:35.222
the guy told me
where I could go.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.791
- Did he?
Let's do a drop-in.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.227
- Yeah, you know what,
Fin and I got this.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.962
Ugh.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.398
- Actually, Rollins, why don't
you stay here with Fin?

07:45.398 --> 07:46.900
- No, seriously, no,
I'm fine.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.602
- No, seriously,
just work the phones.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.671
You know,
food stamps, housing.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.305
Carisi, let's go.

07:56.677 --> 07:59.547
- How the hell you gonna
tell me I can't see her?

07:59.547 --> 08:01.915
Get out my damn face!
- A little help please?

08:01.915 --> 08:03.917
- I'm just trying to see
my daughter, okay?

08:03.917 --> 08:06.419
- Let's go, sir.
- Welcome to the jungle.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.455
- We good?

08:09.990 --> 08:12.225
- [sighs]
You all right, Keith?

08:12.225 --> 08:14.995
- Yeah, he's just got
a little bit of anger there.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.930
- Keith Musio, Ser--

08:16.930 --> 08:20.233
- Sergeant Benson.
- And Detective...

08:20.233 --> 08:21.769
- Detective Carisi
from SVU.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.436
- Oh. SVU?
What happened?

08:23.436 --> 08:25.573
- Get your ass out of here!
- Don't talk to me like that!

08:25.573 --> 08:27.575
Treat me like a man.
- Will you excuse me?

08:27.575 --> 08:29.109
- So your boss tells us

08:29.109 --> 08:31.344
that you have some families
in the Conyers Projects.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.780
- At least a dozen.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.014
- This kid one of them?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.583
Name's Bruno.

08:35.583 --> 08:38.586
- Um, I think so.
This way.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.194
Um...

08:47.194 --> 08:48.395
Yeah, here it is.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.797
Bruno Ozuna.

08:49.797 --> 08:50.898
Is he okay?

08:50.898 --> 08:52.600
- You must not watch the news.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.434
- With this job, I barely
have time to take a piss.

08:54.434 --> 08:55.869
- Bruno Ozuna was found

08:55.869 --> 08:57.370
wandering the streets
last night.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.207
Alone.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.775
- Is he okay?

09:01.775 --> 09:03.977
- We need to find his mother.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.146
- Sorry, elevator's
always out.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.682
And the stairs can get
pretty rank in the summer.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.450
- When was the last time
you were here?

09:10.450 --> 09:11.619
- A couple weeks ago.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.053
Both kids were fine.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.055
- Kids? Plural.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.290
- Bruno has a half-sister.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.392
Keisha Houston, she's eight.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.428
It's just down the hall.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.837
- This is six
dead bolt country.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.872
That door's not even
locked.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.943
- Manuela Ozuna?

09:35.943 --> 09:37.711
[TV in background]

09:37.711 --> 09:38.946
NYPD--

09:48.856 --> 09:51.224
- She's not here.
No wonder Bruno walked.

09:51.224 --> 09:53.026
This place is a furnace.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.696
- She's not in there.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.731
- I think she sleeps
down there.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.868
- Hello?

10:00.868 --> 10:02.903
Keisha?

10:08.909 --> 10:10.944
Keisha?

10:13.213 --> 10:15.615
What is this?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.450
Carisi?

10:17.450 --> 10:18.919
Oh, my God.
- It's a kid.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.957
Keisha? Keisha, honey?

10:23.957 --> 10:25.893
Can you hear me?
- Oh, my God.

10:25.893 --> 10:30.297
- Keisha, can you hear me?

10:31.699 --> 10:33.100
There's a pulse.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.401
It's just faint.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.469
- Hey, I need a bus
here right now.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.238
Conyers Project,
building 6, apartment 9-J.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.807
- She's tiny.

10:39.807 --> 10:40.974
I thought you said
she was eight years old.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.275
- She is.
She's almost nine.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.777
- Keisha?

10:43.777 --> 10:45.946
Keisha, sweetheart.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.148
It's okay, honey.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.583
We're gonna get you
some help, sweetie.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.452
We're gonna get you
some help, sweetie.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.954
You're okay.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.989
You're okay.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.457
You're gonna be okay.

11:03.764 --> 11:04.732
.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.735
[monitor beeping steadily]

11:11.204 --> 11:13.540
- That poor kid.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.142
Still no sign of the mother?

11:15.142 --> 11:17.410
- Fin's working the dealer.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.480
Dr. Wilder, how's she doing?

11:20.480 --> 11:21.581
- Not well.

11:21.581 --> 11:24.351
Starvation, infections.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.486
She's so dehydrated
her organs are shutting down.

11:26.486 --> 11:30.758
- But she's gonna
make it though, right, Doc?

11:30.758 --> 11:33.193
- I wish you'd have
found her sooner.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.175
[whispering]
Thank you, thank you...

11:48.175 --> 11:49.843
- Manuela Ozuna?

11:49.843 --> 11:51.211
- What you got?

11:51.211 --> 11:53.213
- We got your kids.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.514
Get up.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.784
- What? What do you mean
you got my kids?

11:56.784 --> 11:58.351
I'm their mother.
- That's what you tell yourself?

11:58.351 --> 11:59.787
You don't act like it.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.822
- Yo, what you doing, man?

12:01.822 --> 12:03.323
- You're under arrest.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.992
- You ain't got no right.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.359
- Shut up.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.467
- Hey, you feeling better?

12:14.467 --> 12:16.503
- Yeah.

12:18.438 --> 12:21.141
When I was a rookie,
I used to puke all the time.

12:22.876 --> 12:27.314
Keisha...the way she looked.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.817
- Keith, you were just there
a couple of weeks ago.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.418
I mean, how did she look then?

12:32.886 --> 12:35.055
- Well,
I'm trying to remember.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.090
You know...

12:37.090 --> 12:38.892
there's so many visits
in a day.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.528
At least eight or nine.
I never have enough time.

12:41.528 --> 12:45.732
- Yeah, but you did see Keisha
two weeks ago, right?

12:45.732 --> 12:47.634
- I-I m-must have.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.837
I mean,
I'd have to check my notes.

12:49.837 --> 12:53.640
Look, the Ozunas weren't even
my family to begin with.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.176
My colleague has been
on maternity leave,

12:56.176 --> 12:58.178
so now I have
twice the workload.

12:58.178 --> 13:01.281
- Okay.
- I'm doing 12-hour turns here.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.916
Rushing through visits.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.152
And all the paperwork,
and the court appearances--

13:05.152 --> 13:07.287
- Okay, okay, I get it.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.156
But you know where I'm going
with this, right?

13:10.757 --> 13:12.059
We just picked up
Keisha's mother.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.494
There's gonna be more questions.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.929
- Bruno.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.565
That's my good boy.
I want him back.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.901
- That's not happening.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.769
Keith Musio's putting him
in foster care.

13:22.769 --> 13:25.738
- Keith?
I don't know no damn Keith.

13:25.738 --> 13:29.242
- Your DCS caseworker?

13:29.242 --> 13:30.677
- Oh! Him.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.512
Last time I seen him
he was up my ass

13:32.512 --> 13:34.915
about feeding my kids
chips for dinner.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.784
- Chips? We found your daughter
in a cage.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.019
Starving.

13:39.019 --> 13:42.956
- Well, that's Keisha's fault.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.025
If she'd shut up, stop crying,

13:45.025 --> 13:46.693
maybe she'd earn herself
some food.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.133
- Oh, so you starved her
to teach her a lesson?

13:53.133 --> 13:55.602
- My mother used to whip me with
an electrical cord till I bled.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.637
You want I should do that?

14:06.779 --> 14:09.182
- The mother is a piece of work.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.951
- She's also a murderer.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.588
- Keisha didn't make it.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.192
- Damn.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.195
[somber music]

14:22.195 --> 14:26.399
*

14:26.399 --> 14:27.667
- Was it as bad as
the headlines?

14:27.667 --> 14:30.137
- It's worse.
- We got the autopsy report.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.571
Keisha Houston's cause of death

14:31.571 --> 14:33.273
is child abuse syndrome

14:33.273 --> 14:35.742
due to prolonged physical abuse,

14:35.742 --> 14:36.977
malnutrition, dehydration.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.211
- That's homicide.
- Yeah.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.412
- Where was Child Services?

14:39.412 --> 14:40.948
- Well, Carisi talked
to Keith Musio,

14:40.948 --> 14:42.715
her caseworker.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.284
He's so slammed he doesn't
remember yesterday.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.986
- His supervisor,
Jeanette Grayson,

14:45.986 --> 14:48.388
claims that DCS is launching
an internal investigation.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.822
- You mean cover-up.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.992
- Keisha's dead.
What's there to cover up?

14:51.992 --> 14:53.961
- Their complicity.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.795
The caseworker botched this.

14:55.795 --> 14:58.765
- You want to prosecute
the caseworker?

14:58.765 --> 14:59.832
- Yes.

14:59.832 --> 15:01.501
- Brooklyn tried that
and lost.

15:01.501 --> 15:03.070
Morally responsible,
okay, legally--

15:03.070 --> 15:04.837
- Keisha didn't lose

15:04.837 --> 15:06.706
20 pounds in two weeks.
If Keith had actually been

15:06.706 --> 15:08.841
showing up for his visits,
he would have noticed.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.143
- And she'd still be alive.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.178
- Okay, all right, I get it.

15:11.178 --> 15:12.579
You're angry, emotional,

15:12.579 --> 15:14.647
but if you want me
to go after this guy,

15:14.647 --> 15:19.252
I'm gonna need more than
maternal outrage to make a case.

15:19.252 --> 15:23.190
- This is a caseworker and
a supervisor's worst nightmare.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.893
- Yeah, the whole city's
heartbroken.

15:26.893 --> 15:29.429
- Just tell me Manuela is not
gonna get away with this.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.898
- Well, this brings us
to why we're here.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.601
We're looking
to document Manuela's abuse.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.103
- Now, Keith, you told me

15:36.103 --> 15:38.005
that you visited the apartment
two weeks ago.

15:38.005 --> 15:41.374
- Yeah, that's right,
and I've got that right here.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.511
Home visit,
July 27th around 2:00 pm.

15:44.511 --> 15:47.214
"Manuela Ozuna
is present and sober.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.715
"Son, Bruno,
and daughter, Keisha,

15:48.715 --> 15:51.718
are also present,
clean, and seem healthy."

15:51.718 --> 15:53.053
- Okay, so Keisha was there,
because when we talked

15:53.053 --> 15:54.387
you said you weren't sure.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.423
- No, I said I had
to check my notes.

15:56.423 --> 15:59.026
- Yes, which we did.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.528
And we've gone through these
with a fine-tooth comb.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.763
- Okay, hold on, so you're
saying that two weeks ago,

16:03.763 --> 16:05.765
that Keisha looked healthy?

16:05.765 --> 16:08.468
- Yeah, that's what the report
says, but you know,

16:08.468 --> 16:11.104
these situations with parents
on a drug binge,

16:11.104 --> 16:13.473
they can deteriorate like that.
[snaps]

16:13.473 --> 16:15.675
- Jeanette, you should've
brought me in.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.344
Matt Sheridan,
Deputy Commissioner.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.778
Let me assure you that

16:18.778 --> 16:20.713
our agency is reviewing
every moment and action

16:20.713 --> 16:22.549
that led up to this tragedy.

16:22.549 --> 16:25.185
- So is our ADA, so we're
gonna need Keith's laptop

16:25.185 --> 16:26.886
and all of his case files.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.055
- We're here to cooperate,

16:28.055 --> 16:30.590
but because of
confidentiality issues,

16:30.590 --> 16:34.161
we can't hand anything over
without a subpoena.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.164
[dramatic music]

16:37.164 --> 16:38.698
*

16:38.698 --> 16:40.700
- So there is
a home visit report

16:40.700 --> 16:42.335
on the Ozunas
dated two weeks ago?

16:42.335 --> 16:43.636
- There is.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.205
- That doesn't mean
he was there.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.674
- If I had to guess,
he hasn't seen the Ozunas

16:47.674 --> 16:49.242
for at least four months.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.311
- Four months?
How do we know?

16:51.311 --> 16:53.380
- I ran a statement analysis

16:53.380 --> 16:56.683
on a year's worth
of his home visit reports.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.352
Detail in his earlier reports
compared to the latest--

16:59.352 --> 17:00.587
it's night and day.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.222
- Walk me through this.
- All right.

17:02.222 --> 17:04.324
- Keith inherits the Ozuna case
last November

17:04.324 --> 17:06.093
when his co-worker
starts maternity leave.

17:06.093 --> 17:08.495
Now that jumps his caseload
from 30 to 47.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.398
- Even so, there's
extensive handwritten notes

17:11.398 --> 17:12.965
on each field visit,

17:12.965 --> 17:17.304
and his typed reports
are one, two, three pages,

17:17.304 --> 17:18.971
scanned in in a timely manner.

17:18.971 --> 17:21.141
- Yeah, and at this point,
Keith's logging 16,

17:21.141 --> 17:22.775
17-hour days,

17:22.775 --> 17:24.444
but with the court hearings
and the family visits--

17:24.444 --> 17:26.113
- It's a losing battle.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.115
- By April,
no more handwritten notes.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.317
- And after April?
- No reports on the Ozunas

17:30.317 --> 17:33.520
were scanned in at all until
the morning after Keisha died.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.257
- He goes in,
and he backdates nine reports.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.792
- And all these cases
take place at the same time

17:39.792 --> 17:41.261
that his calendar
has him in court

17:41.261 --> 17:43.130
or visiting other clients
miles away.

17:43.130 --> 17:46.199
- His supervisor
signed off on these?

17:46.199 --> 17:48.135
- Yep, even the ones
[phone vibrates]

17:48.135 --> 17:51.771
scanned in eight hours
after Keisha's death.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.274
- Okay, copy that.

17:54.274 --> 17:55.608
That was the sarge.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.610
She just got called down
to 1PP by Dodds.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.147
They want a briefing on
all the stuff we found at DCS.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.849
- That's not good.
- No, it's not.

18:02.849 --> 18:06.319
Why don't I walk over?
Pay my respects.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.357
[dramatic music]

18:10.357 --> 18:12.525
- I understand your concern,
Sergeant,

18:12.525 --> 18:14.761
but Child Services
is a city agency.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.163
There are protocols.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.631
- A caseworker
lied about his visits.

18:18.631 --> 18:21.168
A supervisor signed off
on false reports.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.636
Child Services is responsible
for Keisha's death.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.173
- The city has
a Department of Investigation.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.875
If they decide something
criminal has transpired...

18:28.875 --> 18:31.211
- Which they won't.
- Then NYPD gets involved.

18:31.211 --> 18:35.548
- Since when does NYPD kick
an investigation back to DOI?

18:35.548 --> 18:37.184
Who's this coming from,
City Hall?

18:37.184 --> 18:39.286
- No one likes bad headlines,
but let me be clear.

18:39.286 --> 18:41.721
I'm not just in charge of press
for NYPD.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.656
I'm the commissioner's
right hand.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.892
I work for him,
and so do you.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.327
- I issued the subpoenas.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.762
SVU is investigating
at my request.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.964
- SVU doesn't work for you,
Counselor.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.734
- All right,
we're all friends here.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.970
The commissioner wanted us
to convey that, as of now,

18:57.970 --> 19:00.773
this is not a police matter,
but if it becomes one--

19:00.773 --> 19:02.975
- You'll let us know.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.345
- I'm glad
we're all on the same page.

19:05.345 --> 19:09.516
By the way, I hear you're
on the Lieutenant's List.

19:09.516 --> 19:12.485
Congratulations.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.587
- Thank you.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.591
- So that's it.
They just call us off.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.927
- Well, they called you off.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.363
I don't work for NYPD.

19:23.363 --> 19:26.266
[dramatic music]

19:26.266 --> 19:27.434
Good morning.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.902
I am ADA Raphael Barba.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.704
[camera shutters snapping]

19:31.704 --> 19:35.908
Early last Saturday morning,
eight-year-old Keisha Houston

19:35.908 --> 19:38.511
died after her mother,

19:38.511 --> 19:44.451
Manuela Ozuna,
locked her in a dog cage.

19:44.451 --> 19:48.255
Ms. Ozuna has been
charged with homicide.

19:48.255 --> 19:50.623
At the time
of her death,

19:50.623 --> 19:52.124
Keisha was
under the supervision

19:52.124 --> 19:54.927
of the
Department of Child Services.

19:54.927 --> 19:59.532
Our investigation has revealed
that Keith Musio,

19:59.532 --> 20:01.368
her caseworker...
- Keith Musio.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.936
- Falsely reported having made
- You're under arrest--

20:03.936 --> 20:09.141
home visits to the family
for the last four months.

20:09.141 --> 20:13.413
Digging deeper, we discovered
this caseworker's fraud

20:13.413 --> 20:16.649
was orchestrated
by his supervisor,

20:16.649 --> 20:18.651
Jeanette Grayson.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.487
Overseeing this unit

20:20.487 --> 20:23.890
was Deputy Commissioner
Matt Sheridan

20:23.890 --> 20:25.892
who has also been taken
into custody.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.094
Among the charges are,

20:28.094 --> 20:32.164
reckless endangerment
of a child, official misconduct,

20:32.164 --> 20:36.002
and obstructing
governmental administration,

20:36.002 --> 20:38.338
as well as a felony charge

20:38.338 --> 20:42.742
of manslaughter
in the second degree.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.110
Thank you.

20:44.110 --> 20:47.880
[reporters shouting]

20:52.285 --> 20:52.419
.

20:54.086 --> 20:54.787
- Matt Sheridan,
Jeannette Grayson,

20:55.455 --> 20:56.723
and Keith Musio,

20:56.723 --> 20:58.825
in addition
to the aforementioned charges,

20:58.825 --> 21:00.860
you are also charged
with manslaughter

21:00.860 --> 21:02.429
in the second degree.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.597
How do you plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.734
The ADA's attempt
to expand criminal liability

21:07.734 --> 21:09.936
for Keisha Houston's
tragic death

21:09.936 --> 21:12.505
is a purely political
overreach.

21:12.505 --> 21:15.241
- Something you can elucidate
at trial, Mr. D'Angelo.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.376
People on bail?

21:16.376 --> 21:18.044
- People request $200,000.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.779
- And the overreach continues.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.415
My clients have no records.
They are civil servants.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.050
They are paid
like civil servants.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.519
They should be ROR.
- Duly noted.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.488
Bail is set
at $50,000 per defendant.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.357
[taps gavel]

21:30.357 --> 21:33.926
[indistinct murmuring]

21:36.028 --> 21:39.198
- Sergeant.

21:39.198 --> 21:40.867
I told you to drop this case.

21:40.867 --> 21:43.069
- And we did.
ADA picked it up.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.704
- Yes, we all saw
his showboating.

21:44.704 --> 21:48.808
Hey, Barba,
you got your punim on TV, man.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.810
The press
is kissing your ass.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.679
But now's the time
to do your real job

21:52.679 --> 21:54.080
and plead this out.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.484
- I'm sorry.
You're NYPD's press boy, right?

21:57.484 --> 22:00.420
As you've already made clear,
I don't work for you.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.955
- Look, as a friend,

22:02.955 --> 22:05.725
I'd hate to see
the tall poppy get cut down.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.532
- That was subtle.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.467
- They apply that much pressure,
that means they're scared.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.969
- Politicians,
I swear to God.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.805
What are you gonna do,
Counselor?

22:18.805 --> 22:20.840
- Well, if I'm gonna
plea it out,

22:20.840 --> 22:22.575
I'm gonna need leverage.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.415
[dramatic music]

22:28.415 --> 22:31.217
- Ms. Ozuna's agreed to talk
with you, but she has a request.

22:31.217 --> 22:32.652
- Do you think
you could ask the judge

22:32.652 --> 22:36.222
to let me out
for Keisha's funeral?

22:36.222 --> 22:37.690
- Uh, yeah,
we'll see about that.

22:37.690 --> 22:41.728
- Just help us
understand something.

22:41.728 --> 22:44.597
How did it get so bad,
Manuela?

22:44.597 --> 22:48.234
Your caseworker's report said
that you were clean and sober

22:48.234 --> 22:50.870
and both of your kids
were okay.

22:50.870 --> 22:53.506
- I was...

22:53.506 --> 22:55.775
until Filipe got released.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.076
- Filipe?

22:57.076 --> 22:59.946
- Bruno's dad.

22:59.946 --> 23:02.615
After his bid in May,
he moved back in with us.

23:02.615 --> 23:05.284
- May?

23:05.284 --> 23:06.753
The home report
didn't mention him.

23:06.753 --> 23:09.522
When was the last time
you saw your caseworker?

23:12.625 --> 23:15.127
- I haven't seen a caseworker
since Easter.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.163
- Okay, so when
Filipe moved back in,

23:17.163 --> 23:18.465
you guys started partying.

23:18.465 --> 23:22.769
- We weren't junkies.
We were having fun.

23:22.769 --> 23:25.037
Drinking.
Barbecuing.

23:25.037 --> 23:29.976
The two of us and Bruno,
we were a family again.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.011
- What about Keisha?

23:33.345 --> 23:36.483
- Felipe wasn't Keisha's dad.

23:36.483 --> 23:38.618
She didn't like us partying.

23:38.618 --> 23:43.122
She mouthed off to him,
and I told her

23:43.122 --> 23:46.859
to keep her mouth shut,
but she wouldn't listen.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.995
So Felipe got a cage.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.032
- And where's Felipe now?

23:55.001 --> 23:57.637
- He got shot
4th of July weekend.

24:02.208 --> 24:06.145
Bled out on the ground.

24:06.145 --> 24:08.515
I fell apart after that.

24:13.119 --> 24:16.889
Oh, my God.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.291
What have I done?

24:22.328 --> 24:26.065
- I am so sorry,
and I feel horrible about this.

24:26.065 --> 24:29.301
- To clarify, that is not
an admission of guilt.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.938
I mean, we agreed to meet
to discuss a potential deal.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.573
- Bluntly, Keith,
as a caseworker on this,

24:33.573 --> 24:35.241
you missed a lot.

24:35.241 --> 24:36.809
- You didn't make mention
the fact that Manuela

24:36.809 --> 24:38.611
was back on drugs,
that she had a boyfriend.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.112
- Because I didn't know--
- You don't have to answer.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.681
- You know what
I think happened?

24:41.681 --> 24:44.050
I think your bosses
gave you an impossible workload

24:44.050 --> 24:46.352
and then they pressured
you to file false reports.

24:46.352 --> 24:47.587
I mean, they set you up
to fail, Keith.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.756
Does that sound right?

24:49.756 --> 24:51.658
- There was a lot of pressure.
- Hey, hey, hey.

24:51.658 --> 24:52.759
We're all overworked.

24:52.759 --> 24:54.927
You, Detective.
You, Counselor.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.196
It's not a crime.
It's a reality.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.165
- Why don't you let your client
answer the question?

24:59.165 --> 25:01.868
- Actually,
I'll answer for him.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.169
Shame on you...

25:03.169 --> 25:07.574
using this tragedy
to score political points.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.008
If your idea of a deal

25:09.008 --> 25:13.445
is to pit co-worker
against co-worker, well,

25:13.445 --> 25:15.147
it's a non-starter.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.621
Hang in there, Keith.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.590
Gentlemen.

25:30.630 --> 25:33.900
- I forgot my pen.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.202
A word to the wise,
all right?

25:36.202 --> 25:37.870
I know the union lawyered
up the three of you,

25:37.870 --> 25:39.471
but you are low man
on the totem pole.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.741
So if anybody's gonna
take the fall here...

25:46.278 --> 25:47.880
- Is there anything
Barba can use?

25:47.880 --> 25:49.448
- You know how Keith backdated
the reports

25:49.448 --> 25:50.717
right after Keisha died?

25:50.717 --> 25:53.052
- Wasn't just Keith.
- What?

25:53.052 --> 25:54.787
- Dozens of
other caseworker's reports

25:54.787 --> 25:56.488
were scanned in that day,
all generic,

25:56.488 --> 25:58.357
all filed the morning
after she died.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.927
- What's going on here?

26:00.927 --> 26:04.330
- Just--just, um, catching up
on some paperwork.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.165
- Uh-huh.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.967
A word, Sergeant.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.236
- [murmurs]

26:20.012 --> 26:22.715
For God's sake,
you don't have a political bone

26:22.715 --> 26:24.483
in your body, do you?

26:24.483 --> 26:27.186
Abraham is a hatchet man.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.088
He says back off,
you back off.

26:29.088 --> 26:32.224
- This city has blood
on its hands.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.994
Barba is doing
the right thing.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.495
- I know
that you're close to him,

26:36.495 --> 26:38.665
but if he wants to hang himself,
let him.

26:38.665 --> 26:43.169
Don't get stuck
in his noose.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.537
Also, Detective Rollins--

26:45.537 --> 26:47.106
I'm assuming you're aware
that she's pregnant.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.507
- I know.

26:48.507 --> 26:50.710
Look, we're down a man.
I've been looking the other way.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.178
- Well, not anymore.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.714
Starting yesterday,
she's on desk duty.

26:54.714 --> 26:57.216
- Got it.
- Good.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.854
- If Dodds is here,
I'm busted.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.690
- Desk duty,
I wouldn't mind.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.457
Yeah, Fin,
I know.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.693
- Hey, they still in there?

27:06.693 --> 27:09.696
- Yeah, stay out.
- Good point.

27:09.696 --> 27:10.930
Uh, when Dodds leaves,

27:10.930 --> 27:12.531
tell Sarge
I went back to the pen.

27:12.531 --> 27:14.533
Keith wants to talk.

27:17.269 --> 27:20.973
- Jeanette was breathing down
my neck about the paperwork.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.710
She told me to stop
coddling my clients.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.377
- Meaning what?

27:25.377 --> 27:26.512
- Meaning stop
taking their phone calls.

27:26.512 --> 27:28.214
Stop counseling.

27:28.214 --> 27:31.217
She would say, "This is
casework, not social work."

27:31.217 --> 27:32.484
- She told you this
explicitly?

27:32.484 --> 27:34.721
- Absolutely.

27:34.721 --> 27:37.724
Jeanette and Matt even said
that I didn't have to

27:37.724 --> 27:39.225
make all my visits
as long as there was

27:39.225 --> 27:41.227
some sort of record
that I had.

27:41.227 --> 27:44.130
- So when we found Keisha,
you hadn't seen her for months,

27:44.130 --> 27:46.565
but Jeanette and Matt
told you to report that you had.

27:46.565 --> 27:50.569
- This is where I say
that my client has information

27:50.569 --> 27:54.073
that could prove very helpful
in bolstering your case.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.742
- Depending on what we hear,
we could downgrade

27:55.742 --> 27:58.577
from manslaughter to
criminally negligent homicide.

27:58.577 --> 28:00.079
- Which is still a felony.

28:00.079 --> 28:02.514
We'll stop here then.
Not another word, Keith.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.551
- No, look, wait.
I don't care.

28:05.551 --> 28:08.187
I mean,
they have to know.

28:10.456 --> 28:11.991
Jeanette...

28:11.991 --> 28:14.794
so she calls me
that Saturday,

28:14.794 --> 28:17.096
and she orders me
to come into the office,

28:17.096 --> 28:19.932
and it's closed, but...

28:19.932 --> 28:23.602
Jeanette and Matt
stand over me

28:23.602 --> 28:25.972
and make me file false reports

28:25.972 --> 28:29.608
saying that
I had visited Keisha's home

28:29.608 --> 28:32.779
and noticed nothing was wrong.

28:32.779 --> 28:35.514
- There were lots of reports
filed that day, Keith.

28:35.514 --> 28:37.449
Were other caseworkers
there?

28:37.449 --> 28:41.020
- No. I mean,
we stayed there all day.

28:41.020 --> 28:45.091
We stayed there into the night
filing lies for half the staff.

28:45.091 --> 28:49.195
- And you're willing
to testify to that?

28:49.195 --> 28:50.562
- Yes.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.532
[suspenseful music]

28:53.532 --> 28:55.434
*

28:55.434 --> 28:58.270
Keisha died on my watch.

29:04.844 --> 29:04.977
.

29:06.813 --> 29:07.646
- Keisha Houston
was a happy and healthy girl

29:08.380 --> 29:10.182
on Christmas, 2014,

29:10.182 --> 29:13.419
when she and her family were
still receiving regular visits

29:13.419 --> 29:15.587
from the Department
of Child Services.

29:15.587 --> 29:20.226
On August 7th, months after
those visits ceased,

29:20.226 --> 29:24.130
NYPD detectives
found Keisha...

29:25.531 --> 29:28.134
Locked in this cage,

29:28.134 --> 29:30.970
battered and starved.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.405
She died early
the next morning.

29:33.405 --> 29:36.976
- We're all outraged.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.545
We all want someone to blame.

29:39.545 --> 29:42.114
But what Mr. Barba failed
to mention,

29:42.114 --> 29:43.916
the two people
directly responsible

29:43.916 --> 29:46.385
for Miss Houston's death--

29:46.385 --> 29:49.989
Keith Musio, her caseworker
who took a plea deal

29:49.989 --> 29:52.058
to save his own skin,

29:52.058 --> 29:55.261
and Manuela Ozuna
who abandoned her daughter

29:55.261 --> 29:57.063
without food or water

29:57.063 --> 29:59.131
and went on a drug binge.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.600
- The state will prove that
this tragedy was a direct result

30:01.600 --> 30:04.837
of the policies of the DCS.

30:04.837 --> 30:07.239
Their system-wide failure

30:07.239 --> 30:10.442
prioritized paperwork
over field work.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.845
Caseworkers were ordered
by the defendants,

30:12.845 --> 30:14.947
Jeanette Grayson
and Matt Sheridan,

30:14.947 --> 30:19.285
to falsify reports
and to ignore families in need.

30:19.285 --> 30:23.489
- My clients' only failure
is that they

30:23.489 --> 30:27.593
trusted their caseworker,
and he betrayed them,

30:27.593 --> 30:29.962
the same way
he betrayed Keisha Houston.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.965
[dramatic music]

30:32.965 --> 30:35.001
- In my opinion,
Keisha's condition

30:35.001 --> 30:36.802
would have taken months
to develop.

30:36.802 --> 30:39.505
So if a caseworker
had visited two weeks earlier,

30:39.505 --> 30:41.673
he would have noticed
her deterioration.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.275
- Absolutely.

30:43.275 --> 30:44.643
- Thank you.

30:44.643 --> 30:46.812
Nothing further.

30:46.812 --> 30:48.480
- [clears throat]

30:48.480 --> 30:50.716
- Dr. Wilder, as a physician

30:50.716 --> 30:52.618
you are familiar
with the term triage?

30:52.618 --> 30:53.886
- Yes.

30:53.886 --> 30:55.454
- It means to prioritize,

30:55.454 --> 30:58.657
treat a gunshot wound
before a broken arm.

30:58.657 --> 31:01.160
You must make
these decisions all the time.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.462
- That's right.
- And have you or any doctor

31:03.462 --> 31:05.731
that you've worked with
ever made a mistake

31:05.731 --> 31:07.599
when deciding
who to treat first,

31:07.599 --> 31:10.102
a mistake that resulted
in a patient's death?

31:10.102 --> 31:13.239
- We do our best
to ensure everyone's safety,

31:13.239 --> 31:15.074
but even so, sometimes--

31:15.074 --> 31:17.076
- Sometimes patients die,
right?

31:17.076 --> 31:18.777
I mean, it happens.

31:18.777 --> 31:22.281
And when it does, are you or any
other medical professional

31:22.281 --> 31:24.083
charged with manslaughter?

31:24.083 --> 31:25.317
- No.

31:25.317 --> 31:28.720
- No.
Thank you, Doctor.

31:30.122 --> 31:33.492
- The last time I saw Keisha,
she was fine.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.261
Her mother was sober,

31:35.261 --> 31:37.964
and every week there seemed
to be a family more at risk.

31:37.964 --> 31:41.633
I made the wrong choice,
and I am so sorry for that.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.469
- What happened
on that Saturday morning

31:43.469 --> 31:45.571
a few short hours
after Keisha died?

31:45.571 --> 31:48.340
- Jeanette Grayson
and Matt Sheridan

31:48.340 --> 31:50.409
ordered me to compose,
backdate,

31:50.409 --> 31:55.481
and file false reports of visits
to the Ozuna apartment.

31:55.481 --> 31:58.284
- Why did you go
along with that?

31:58.284 --> 31:59.785
- They said that
if I didn't,

31:59.785 --> 32:02.854
I would go to prison
for Keisha's death.

32:02.854 --> 32:05.491
- Was this the first time
Ms. Grayson or Mr. Sheridan

32:05.491 --> 32:08.094
had ordered you
to falsify case records?

32:08.094 --> 32:11.830
- No, all of us were expected
to appear on paper

32:11.830 --> 32:13.699
more productive
than we actually were.

32:13.699 --> 32:16.902
- Why would Ms. Grayson want her
staff to fudge data like this?

32:16.902 --> 32:19.005
- Objection.
Calls for speculation.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.772
- Rephrase.
During the time

32:20.772 --> 32:23.509
this widespread record
falsification was taking place,

32:23.509 --> 32:26.245
were you reprimanded or
questioned by anyone above you?

32:26.245 --> 32:30.582
- No, um,
I was put on probation

32:30.582 --> 32:33.052
for spending too much time
with my clients,

32:33.052 --> 32:34.920
but the probation was lifted

32:34.920 --> 32:38.924
as soon as I doubled up
on falsifying paperwork.

32:38.924 --> 32:41.893
- All right,
thank you.

32:41.893 --> 32:45.931
- Mr. Musio,
you said in your own words

32:45.931 --> 32:49.035
that you chose not to visit
Ms. Houston

32:49.035 --> 32:50.869
between May and August.

32:50.869 --> 32:52.871
- Yes.
- Now, did Ms. Grayson

32:52.871 --> 32:57.409
or Mr. Sheridan ever tell you
not to make those visits?

32:57.409 --> 32:59.045
- No, but they knew
I couldn't make--

32:59.045 --> 33:00.112
- Are you familiar
with the city's

33:00.112 --> 33:02.114
Department of Investigation,

33:02.114 --> 33:05.151
the agency that investigates
public corruption?

33:05.151 --> 33:08.054
- Yes.
- So you must have

33:08.054 --> 33:11.557
reported your
supervisors' wrongdoing, yes?

33:11.557 --> 33:13.959
At the very least
you must have filed a complaint

33:13.959 --> 33:15.861
about your impossible
case load.

33:15.861 --> 33:19.665
- No, I wanted to keep my job.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.967
- You wanted to keep
your job,

33:21.967 --> 33:25.671
so you only came forward
when you were facing

33:25.671 --> 33:28.840
manslaughter charges, Mr. Musio?
- Yes, but--

33:28.840 --> 33:31.810
- I mean, are you upset
that a vulnerable child

33:31.810 --> 33:33.745
was starved to death
by her drug addicted mother,

33:33.745 --> 33:36.148
or are you just trying
to pin it on your supervisors

33:36.148 --> 33:37.183
to save yourself?

33:37.183 --> 33:38.250
- Objection.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.818
- Withdrawn.

33:40.919 --> 33:43.089
Nothing further.

33:43.089 --> 33:46.092
[dramatic music]

33:51.097 --> 33:51.197
.

33:52.998 --> 33:53.732
- You know I missed
Keisha's funeral.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.570
My transportation showed up
three hours late.

33:58.570 --> 34:03.475
- That's why they're letting
you see Bruno now.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.611
- I'm doing eight years.

34:05.611 --> 34:09.014
By the time I get out,
he'll be halfway to a man.

34:09.014 --> 34:11.417
- They found a good home
for him.

34:11.417 --> 34:14.453
If he's lucky,
he won't remember any of this

34:14.453 --> 34:16.388
or you.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.995
[dramatic music]

34:23.995 --> 34:25.597
- Ms. Grayson,
what can you tell us

34:25.597 --> 34:28.500
about Mr. Musio's reports
on the Ozuna home?

34:28.500 --> 34:30.836
- All of them indicated
that the family was functioning,

34:30.836 --> 34:32.371
and the children were safe.

34:32.371 --> 34:33.972
- And you,
as a supervisor,

34:33.972 --> 34:36.775
do you also make home visits?
- No.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.845
- So you relied
on Mr. Musio's reports

34:39.845 --> 34:41.613
on Ms. Houston's condition.

34:41.613 --> 34:43.182
- Yes.

34:43.182 --> 34:45.851
And I had no idea
how badly things had devolved.

34:45.851 --> 34:50.556
I mean, I'm heartbroken for
Keisha and how she suffered,

34:50.556 --> 34:54.460
but I only wish Keith
had come to me sooner.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.662
- Thank you, Ms. Grayson.

34:56.662 --> 35:01.400
- Ms. Grayson,
have you received any promotions

35:01.400 --> 35:03.602
or raises over the past year?

35:03.602 --> 35:04.736
- I have.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.738
Two promotions
and one raise.

35:06.738 --> 35:09.741
- And were they based
on productivity levels

35:09.741 --> 35:11.777
as they related to caseloads?

35:11.777 --> 35:13.179
- I believe so.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.183
- Over the last year,

35:17.183 --> 35:22.588
you increased Keith Musio's
caseloads from 30 to 47.

35:22.588 --> 35:25.557
As an experienced supervisor--
- We're all overworked.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.493
- But did you honestly think it
was possible for one caseworker

35:27.493 --> 35:29.728
to make as many home visits
as you had assigned him?

35:29.728 --> 35:32.898
- According to Keith's reports,
he did make those visits.

35:32.898 --> 35:34.800
- But you knew he didn't,

35:34.800 --> 35:37.969
which is why after her death you
ordered Mr. Musio to backdate

35:37.969 --> 35:43.242
and file case reports on Keisha,
isn't that right?

35:43.242 --> 35:46.978
- When I realized
how behind how behind he was

35:46.978 --> 35:48.247
in his paperwork...
- Uh-huh.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.616
- I asked him to come in
so we could walk

35:50.616 --> 35:52.251
through the chain
of events.

35:52.251 --> 35:55.221
- Just Keith or...
did any of the other caseworkers

35:55.221 --> 35:56.688
come in
on that Saturday morning?

35:56.688 --> 35:58.824
- No, just Keith.

35:58.824 --> 36:05.364
- Huh. Then how did
130 home visit reports

36:05.364 --> 36:06.732
from eight
different caseworkers

36:06.732 --> 36:09.501
get scanned in
on August 8th?

36:09.501 --> 36:11.903
- I have no knowledge of that.
- Uh-huh.

36:11.903 --> 36:15.106
You have no knowledge
of case number 30632?

36:15.106 --> 36:18.244
People's exhibit
16 through 28, Your Honor.

36:18.244 --> 36:20.246
This boy's caseworker
visited every week

36:20.246 --> 36:23.715
even though his family had moved
back to El Salvador a year ago.

36:23.715 --> 36:29.288
Or about case number 20185,
a four-year-old girl,

36:29.288 --> 36:31.890
given the all clear by you
on the very day

36:31.890 --> 36:34.993
that she was admitted to the ER

36:34.993 --> 36:38.129
with cigarette burns
all over her body.

36:38.129 --> 36:43.902
Or, how about an eight-year-old
boy, case number 54624.

36:43.902 --> 36:46.037
Another success story on paper,

36:46.037 --> 36:47.939
when the reality was

36:47.939 --> 36:52.278
his mother was forcing him
to drink bleach.

36:52.278 --> 36:54.546
You didn't know
about any of these?

36:54.546 --> 36:56.915
- No, how could I?

36:56.915 --> 36:59.618
- How could you not?

36:59.618 --> 37:01.453
Are you the most
incompetent manager in the world

37:01.453 --> 37:03.188
who can't tell the difference
between a false report

37:03.188 --> 37:04.956
and a legitimate one?

37:04.956 --> 37:07.659
Or did you
instruct caseworkers

37:07.659 --> 37:09.495
to falsify reports
to meet productivity goals?

37:09.495 --> 37:10.862
- Objection.
Badgering.

37:10.862 --> 37:12.197
- I'll allow.
Witness will answer.

37:12.197 --> 37:16.468
- So which one is it,
Ms. Grayson?

37:16.468 --> 37:18.637
- I didn't want
any of this to happen.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.972
- You didn't want
to advance your career

37:20.972 --> 37:22.974
by ignoring innocent children's
pain and death,

37:22.974 --> 37:24.410
or you didn't want
to get caught?

37:24.410 --> 37:26.077
- Objection.

37:26.077 --> 37:29.214
- I'm asked to do
what the courts can't do,

37:29.214 --> 37:31.082
what the cops can't do.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.018
- You are asked to do your job.

37:33.018 --> 37:39.057
- Oh! God himself
could not do this job!

37:39.057 --> 37:40.359
- We need a recess,
Your Honor.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.428
- You want to judge me?

37:42.428 --> 37:46.565
You wouldn't last an hour
in my world.

37:46.565 --> 37:49.435
And if I go, who's gonna be
on the front lines?

37:49.435 --> 37:52.003
You?

37:52.003 --> 37:53.238
You?

37:53.238 --> 37:54.673
- Your Honor?

37:54.673 --> 37:57.108
- I mean, you dump
the most hapless cases

37:57.108 --> 37:59.778
in the world
on us every day.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.613
More and more.

38:01.613 --> 38:04.416
We get the dregs of humanity--

38:04.416 --> 38:07.919
children raised by wolves!

38:10.356 --> 38:12.958
And you see them come
in this court,

38:12.958 --> 38:15.160
in and out,
week in and week out.

38:15.160 --> 38:16.962
They come to you
as criminals.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.030
Do you ever stop to think,

38:19.030 --> 38:22.000
"Gee, what happened
before that?"

38:22.000 --> 38:23.702
- Ms. Grayson,
do you need a break?

38:23.702 --> 38:27.706
- Oh, now you want
to give me a break?

38:27.706 --> 38:31.843
After 25 years of,
"Make your quota, Jeanette.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.212
Push that paper.
Hit those numbers."

38:34.212 --> 38:36.948
Right, Matt?
Right?

38:36.948 --> 38:40.118
It's impossible,
and everybody knows it.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.787
You all know it,

38:41.787 --> 38:43.455
but you want
to scapegoat me.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.591
You want to make me
feel bad.

38:45.591 --> 38:46.992
You want to take me down

38:46.992 --> 38:49.194
so you can feel better
about yourselves, see?

38:49.194 --> 38:51.129
'Cause you pretended like you--
you don't know

38:51.129 --> 38:52.631
there are poor people
out there in the city.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.299
Broken people.

38:54.299 --> 38:55.634
You don't turn away

38:55.634 --> 38:58.303
from the homeless guy
on the subway?

38:58.303 --> 38:59.805
Of course you do.

38:59.805 --> 39:03.308
Everybody does,
'cause it's too much.

39:03.308 --> 39:07.145
Now you want to put me
in jail for this?

39:09.415 --> 39:13.552
Look in the mirror,
my friend.

39:13.552 --> 39:17.623
Look in the damn mirror.
Okay?

39:31.603 --> 39:34.506
- Jeanette
had a complete breakdown.

39:34.506 --> 39:35.741
Is she okay?

39:35.741 --> 39:37.308
- She's in Belleview.

39:37.308 --> 39:38.644
She can't continue
with the trial,

39:38.644 --> 39:40.011
but her lawyer is
gonna plead guilty

39:40.011 --> 39:41.913
to the manslaughter
charge.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.949
- And Matt?
- He'll do a year.

39:43.949 --> 39:45.784
And while admitting
no wrongdoing,

39:45.784 --> 39:48.920
the DCS Commissioner
is also gonna step down.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.122
The city's appointing an outside
administrative board

39:51.122 --> 39:53.759
with a mandate
to change the culture of DCS.

39:53.759 --> 39:56.695
- Right,
until the cameras go away.

39:58.930 --> 40:02.100
I mean, what am I gonna do
when I get out?

40:02.100 --> 40:04.369
No one's gonna let me
work with kids again.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.339
- You'll find your way.

40:16.281 --> 40:17.649
[knocking on door]

40:17.649 --> 40:18.984
- Chief.

40:22.287 --> 40:24.690
Tell it to me straight.

40:24.690 --> 40:27.192
- Congratulations.

40:27.192 --> 40:29.495
Your efforts
to reform Child Services

40:29.495 --> 40:33.865
have not gone unnoticed
at 1PP or City Hall.

40:36.668 --> 40:39.270
- So my promotion's
not happening.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.709
- I had to cut a deal.

40:43.709 --> 40:46.678
They want a sergeant
under you they can trust.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.980
- You mean a spy.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.883
- I found someone
they like who will work for you.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.985
Motivated, smart.

40:53.985 --> 40:57.388
He just finished up
a stint in Anti-Crime.

40:57.388 --> 40:59.791
- Great.
When can I interview him?

40:59.791 --> 41:01.727
- Oh, there's no need.

41:03.962 --> 41:07.132
He's my son.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.000
Good night, Lieutenant.

41:11.770 --> 41:14.372
[door closes]

41:16.842 --> 41:20.278
Detective Rollins,
how are you feeling?

41:20.278 --> 41:22.848
- I'm okay.

41:22.848 --> 41:24.382
That was a tough case.

41:24.382 --> 41:26.184
- Yeah.

41:26.184 --> 41:31.256
Well, you can't
save them all.

41:31.256 --> 41:33.124
- Yeah, I know.

41:33.124 --> 41:36.127
