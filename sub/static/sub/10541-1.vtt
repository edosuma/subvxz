WEBVTT

01:48.775 --> 01:51.737
We should've talked at the boatyard.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.114
You don't wanna talk about it here.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.823
I'm not falling all over myself

01:55.824 --> 01:57.868
to talk about it
much of anywhere, Jack.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.745
How much do you know?

02:00.746 --> 02:02.664
Not much.

02:06.209 --> 02:09.755
The Birmingham one
was in the papers over a month ago.

02:11.340 --> 02:14.926
The second one in Atlanta
was all over TV.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.802
Did you ever think
about giving me a call?

02:16.803 --> 02:19.347
- No.
- Why not?

02:19.348 --> 02:22.142
I quit. Remember?

02:25.937 --> 02:27.773
You look all right now.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.693
I am... all right.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.748
If you can't look anymore,

02:45.749 --> 02:48.417
I understand.

02:48.418 --> 02:51.254
Don't try to run a game
down on me, Jack.

02:57.886 --> 03:01.347
If I really didn't need you
to come back, I wouldn't ask.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.724
This guy's on a lunar cycle.

03:02.891 --> 03:06.394
I have three weeks and a few clays
until the next full moon.

03:06.395 --> 03:09.689
We have a better chance
to get him fast...

03:09.690 --> 03:11.942
If you help.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.862
I'll think about it.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.948
Stay and eat.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.710
L-li, Molly.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.975
- Think it'll keep them out, dad?
- Yep.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.854
How many turtle eggs
think are in here?

04:31.021 --> 04:32.022
Huh? In this hatchery?

04:32.230 --> 04:34.566
I'll bet there's 40 or 50 of them.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.611
Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.446
Yeah, but not now.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.575
These are all gonna make it,
guaranteed.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.037
What about the dogs?

04:48.038 --> 04:50.206
- Are they gonna get in here?
- No, they can't dig under.

04:50.207 --> 04:53.376
You see, that's why we bury the wire
down in the sand.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.964
We need more staples, pal.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.599
You're supposed to be
his friend, Jack.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.977
Why didn't you leave him alone?

05:13.021 --> 05:15.649
If he decides to do it, Molly,

05:16.483 --> 05:19.402
I'll keep him as far away from it
as I can.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.127
We got it pretty good, don't we?

05:37.128 --> 05:38.839
We have it more than good.

05:40.048 --> 05:43.093
All that happened to you before
lets you know that.

05:46.304 --> 05:50.724
If I went back,
I'd only look at evidence.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.061
I wouldn't get deeply involved.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.314
He'd never even see me
or know my name.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.360
If they find him, they'll have
to take him down, not me.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.907
Whatcha think?

06:09.369 --> 06:13.164
I think you've already decided
and you're not really asking.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.128
If I were asking?

06:20.088 --> 06:22.506
Stay here with me,

06:22.507 --> 06:24.884
me and Kevin.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.846
But it's selfish, and I know it.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.437
Come here.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.079
I'll come inside
with you, if you want,

07:35.080 --> 07:37.165
to show you around.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.010
Mr. Crawford said maybe
you'd want to be alone, but...

07:50.011 --> 07:51.680
That's right.

07:53.181 --> 07:57.310
There's a... vcr hooked up
in your hotel room.

07:57.477 --> 08:02.231
They transferred some home movies
of both families onto half-inch vhs.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.316
Thanks.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.380
Intruder entered
through kitchen sliding door.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.174
Used a glass cutter
anchored to a suction cup.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.843
His entry was skillful.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.389
All the prints are smooth gloves.

09:58.556 --> 10:03.556
Blond hair, strong,
size 12 shoe imprint.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.271
Blood ab positive,

10:05.438 --> 10:08.942
typed from saliva on glass
from licking the suction cup.

10:09.692 --> 10:12.612
Why didn't he care
that he left saliva on the glass?

10:16.449 --> 10:19.201
It was hot out that night,

10:19.202 --> 10:22.497
so inside the house
must have felt cool to him.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.045
Intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat
as he was rising,

10:29.212 --> 10:31.213
then shot Mrs. Leeds.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.716
Bullet entered right of her navel
and lodged in her lumbar spine,

10:33.883 --> 10:35.802
but she died of strangulation.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.971
Moderate elevation of serotonin
and marked increase

10:38.972 --> 10:41.432
of free histamine level
in gunshot wound indicates...

10:41.599 --> 10:44.018
She lived at least five minutes
after she was shot.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.397
All her other injuries
were post-mortem.

10:48.398 --> 10:51.943
Direction and velocity of bloodstains
on east wall indicate arterial spray.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.696
Even with his throat cut,
Leeds tried to fight

10:55.697 --> 10:58.366
because the intruder was moving
to the children's room.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.620
Bloodstains on west wall
of master bedroom

11:03.621 --> 11:07.417
and matted sliding marks
on hall carpet remain unexplained,

11:09.002 --> 11:12.921
as does superficial ligature mark
around Mr. Leeds' chest,

11:12.922 --> 11:15.425
also believed to be post-mortem.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.890
What'd the killer do with them
after they were dead?

11:52.879 --> 11:55.130
Hi, this is <i>Valerie Leeds.</i>

11:55.131 --> 11:57.007
<i>Sorry, I can't come
to the phone right now,</i>

11:57.008 --> 11:59.927
<i>but if you'd like to leave a message,
please do so after the beep,</i>

11:59.928 --> 12:01.970
<i>and I'll call you back
as soon as I can.</i>

12:28.915 --> 12:30.582
Mrs. Leeds' injuries
were post-mortem,

12:30.583 --> 12:33.418
four or five minutes later.
What the?

12:33.419 --> 12:36.505
What'd he do in the interval?

12:40.843 --> 12:43.971
The smeared bloodstains
on the west wall...

12:43.972 --> 12:46.182
Uh...

13:28.766 --> 13:30.393
<i>- Hello?
- Molly?</i>

13:31.019 --> 13:34.230
<i>- Will,</i> is <i>that you?</i>
- Yeah, it's me, honey.

13:35.231 --> 13:39.402
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.237
<i>I love you.</i>

13:42.238 --> 13:44.532
I love you too, baby.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.164
What are you dreaming?

14:36.459 --> 14:40.296
That's something you can't afford
for me to know about, isn't it?

14:44.467 --> 14:47.178
God, she's lovely, isn't she?

14:51.682 --> 14:55.728
It was maddening to have to touch her
with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?

14:57.021 --> 14:59.398
They found talcum powder
on her leg,

14:59.399 --> 15:02.902
but there wasn't any talcum powder
in the bathroom.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.157
The talcum powder came out
of a rubber glove

15:09.158 --> 15:11.452
as you pulled it off to touch her.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.457
You took off your gloves
to touch her, didn't you?

15:17.792 --> 15:19.376
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?

15:19.377 --> 15:21.086
You touched her
with your bare hands,

15:21.087 --> 15:23.297
and then you put
your gloves back on.

15:23.506 --> 15:26.425
But while your gloves were off,

15:26.426 --> 15:29.720
did you open all their eyes
so that they could see ya?

15:43.234 --> 15:44.234
<i>Hello?</i>

15:44.235 --> 15:46.737
Jack, this is Graham.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.739
Is price still in latent prints?

15:48.906 --> 15:52.659
<i>Yeah, he's in charge
of the single print index now.</i>

15:52.660 --> 15:54.161
<i>What do you got, will?</i>

15:54.162 --> 15:55.328
Get him to Atlanta.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.038
<i>Atlanta pd swears
they dusted everything,</i>

15:57.039 --> 15:58.331
<i>and their guy is pretty good.</i>

15:58.332 --> 15:59.958
He is good.
He's not as good as price.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.752
<i>I'll get him on a plane
in the morning.</i>

16:01.919 --> 16:04.130
<i>What do you want him to do?</i>

16:05.298 --> 16:10.178
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails
and the corneas of all their eyes.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.765
I think he took off his gloves, Jack.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.770
Our people swear he wore
surgeon's gloves the whole time.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.856
They dusted everything.

16:22.857 --> 16:25.734
Your report didn't mention eyes.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.403
Why do you think
he took his gloves off?

16:28.404 --> 16:30.781
Because Mrs. Leeds
was a beautiful woman.

16:45.963 --> 16:50.301
All right, all right.
Settle down, now.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.596
Sit down, please.

16:54.597 --> 16:57.557
After-house interviews will be
extended an additional four blocks.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.142
Rni's loaned us a couple of clerks

16:59.143 --> 17:00.811
to cross-match
the airline reservations

17:00.978 --> 17:04.314
between Birmingham last month
and Atlanta now.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.983
Dr. princi.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.904
This is what the subject's teeth
looked like.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.449
The Smithsonian in Washington
reconstructed these

17:13.616 --> 17:15.575
from the impressions
that we took of the bite marks

17:15.576 --> 17:16.742
on the Leeds woman here

17:16.743 --> 17:20.748
and the jacobi woman
in Birmingham last month.

17:21.415 --> 17:25.126
As you can see,
he has pegged lateral incisors,

17:25.127 --> 17:28.422
that's these teeth here and here.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.342
All right.

17:32.802 --> 17:35.387
Investigator Graham, you've worked
this kind of thing before.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.223
Can you add anything?

17:39.225 --> 17:41.269
Could you come up to the front?

17:53.573 --> 17:56.909
I don't think he's a drifter,
acting upon victims of opportunity.

17:57.577 --> 18:01.246
Skillful entry indicates
premeditation and planning.

18:01.247 --> 18:04.207
Therefore, I believe
he's an organized individual

18:04.208 --> 18:08.379
who probably lives life competently
with little or no leakage.

18:08.588 --> 18:12.966
Meaning in appearance
he could be absolutely anyone?

18:12.967 --> 18:14.343
That's right.

18:14.510 --> 18:18.555
Bodies being arranged
into an audience and the mirrors

18:18.556 --> 18:20.724
make me believe that there's a rich
and intense fantasy life

18:20.725 --> 18:21.850
going on here.

18:21.851 --> 18:24.603
The elevated experience
is the fantasy.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.938
The act fuels the fantasy.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.774
To discover what he thinks
he's doing in there,

18:29.775 --> 18:32.402
why he picked who he picked,
did what he did,

18:32.403 --> 18:36.197
to understand his motive,
you have to know his illusions,

18:36.198 --> 18:36.949
his dreams.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.909
Which are?

18:40.161 --> 18:41.620
I don't know.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.080
What else do you have for us?

18:44.081 --> 18:45.624
That's all I have.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.083
All right. Vice and narcotics,

18:47.084 --> 18:50.629
you take the k-y cowboys
and the leather bars.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.255
Marcus, Whitman,
heads up at the funeral.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.884
The rest of your assignments
are on the sheet. Let's go.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.303
Oh, well, one more thing.

18:58.012 --> 19:01.473
I've heard officers referring
to this killer as the tooth fairy.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.643
Yeah. Well, I don't want to hear that
in public,

19:04.644 --> 19:07.979
and I don't want to see it
in internal memoranda. That's it.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.746
I know a burglar's gonna fence
what he stole

19:24.747 --> 19:26.831
'cause his motive is cash money.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.877
I know his motive,
so I go to work on fences.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.338
This guy, we don't even have motive.

19:33.381 --> 19:36.341
None of us have shit,
and we know it.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.677
It's in his dreams.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.595
<i>- His motive?
- Yeah.</i>

19:40.596 --> 19:42.472
The commissioner was saying
that you're the one

19:42.473 --> 19:44.850
who, uh, got Garrett Jacob hobbs,

19:45.017 --> 19:47.602
and then Dr. lecktor
three years ago.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.562
Lecktor killed nine people,
didn't he?

19:49.563 --> 19:52.358
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.

19:53.234 --> 19:55.068
What happened to them?

19:55.069 --> 19:57.737
One's on a respirator
at a hospital in Baltimore,

19:57.738 --> 19:59.906
the other's in a private
mental hospital in Denver.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.618
What the psychologists say
was wrong with lecktor?

20:04.704 --> 20:07.622
The psychologists call him
a psychopath.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.875
They don't know what else
to call him.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.423
I understand he cut you pretty good.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.846
What about the dog?

20:23.556 --> 20:24.556
It's at the vet's.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.807
The kids brought it in

20:25.808 --> 20:27.600
with a puncture wound
in the abdomen.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.894
The jacobis in Birmingham
had a cat, didn't they?

20:29.895 --> 20:32.021
That's right.

20:32.022 --> 20:35.192
We found a litter box downstairs,
but we didn't find a cat.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.362
Why don't you get Birmingham pd
a methane probe out of Washington,

20:39.363 --> 20:40.947
have them cover the backyard.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.950
Maybe the cat's dead
and the kids buried it.

20:45.786 --> 20:46.745
Yeah?

20:46.746 --> 20:49.038
<i>This</i> is <i>Jimmy</i> price, <i>FBI.</i>

20:49.039 --> 20:51.791
- Let me put you on speakerphone.
- Who <i>am I</i> talking <i>to?</i>

20:51.792 --> 20:54.419
Uh, Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford.
You got will Graham here, too.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.796
<i>I got a partial print
with a tented arch,</i>

20:56.797 --> 20:58.131
<i>it's probably a thumb.</i>

20:58.132 --> 20:59.591
<i>And the fragment of a palm</i>

20:59.592 --> 21:02.010
<i>off the nail
of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.</i>

21:02.011 --> 21:04.345
<i>Thumbprint came off
the oldest kid's left eye.</i>

21:04.346 --> 21:06.556
<i>It stood out against
an eight-ball hemorrhage</i>

21:06.557 --> 21:07.724
<i>from the gunshot wound.</i>

21:07.725 --> 21:09.684
Can we make an identification
off of it?

21:09.685 --> 21:13.396
<i>Maybe, if he's ever been
printed and he's in my index.</i>

21:13.397 --> 21:14.815
<i>I want to work these up
in my own darkroom.</i>

21:14.982 --> 21:17.234
<i>I'll fax the prints down to you
this afternoon.</i>

21:17.401 --> 21:19.110
Thanks, Jimmy.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.126
No -- no comment.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.631
If we get lucky
with that print, we're in,

21:39.632 --> 21:42.425
if Jimmy can find him in the index
and if he's ever been printed.

21:42.426 --> 21:43.885
- Hey, will Graham!
- If not, I don't know.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.720
Whadda ya hear? Whadda ya say?
You remember me?

21:45.721 --> 21:47.640
Freddie lounds, covered
the lecktor case for the tattler,

21:47.807 --> 21:49.099
did the paperback.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.059
So, come on, will,
when did they call you in?

21:51.060 --> 21:52.811
What do you got? Hey, look,
I'm buying lunch, all right?

21:52.812 --> 21:54.604
Hey, lounds,
why don't you give it a rest?

21:54.605 --> 21:56.397
Hey, he's news.
I'm doing my job.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.942
So, how does this guy compare
with lecktor? Huh?

21:58.108 --> 22:00.985
What does he do to 'em?
How's he do 'em?

22:00.986 --> 22:02.905
How's he do 'em, will?

22:05.950 --> 22:07.618
Keep the fuck away from me.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.912
Will, will.

22:16.877 --> 22:18.586
The son of a bitch snuck
into the hospital

22:18.587 --> 22:19.838
while I was sedated after lecktor.

22:19.839 --> 22:22.090
He pulled back the sheets,
and he took pictures.

22:22.091 --> 22:23.466
Yeah, I know.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.468
Look, don't expect too much
from me, all right?

22:25.469 --> 22:27.804
We only got three weeks left,
and you're our best shot.

22:27.805 --> 22:29.514
What, you think I'm gonna see him
standing in the street,

22:29.515 --> 22:30.598
and say, "there he is"?

22:30.599 --> 22:33.310
That's Houdini you're thinking about.

22:35.104 --> 22:38.148
The tooth fairy's gonna go on
until we get smart or we get lucky.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.942
- He won't stop.
- Why?

22:40.943 --> 22:43.444
He's got a genuine taste for it.

22:43.445 --> 22:45.739
You do know something about him.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.451
Not enough.

22:51.829 --> 22:54.080
Think I'll go see lecktor tomorrow.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.916
Why?

22:56.834 --> 22:59.086
Recover the mindset.

23:09.013 --> 23:10.471
- Yeah?
- Hey, hotshot.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.640
- You doing some good?
- Nothing you'd notice.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.517
- I miss ya.
- Me <i>too.</i>

23:14.518 --> 23:16.644
<i>I miss my husband.</i>

23:16.645 --> 23:17.730
What's going on?

23:18.898 --> 23:20.106
Day-to-day is boring.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.692
<i>Tell me what you're doing.</i>

23:22.693 --> 23:24.777
I'm eatin' room service.

23:24.778 --> 23:26.487
They don't have a lock on anything,
Molly.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.031
There's not enough
physical evidence,

23:28.032 --> 23:30.116
or else I haven't done enough
with it yet.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.784
<i>Were you gonna be in Atlanta long?</i>

23:31.785 --> 23:33.828
<i>I mean, you know, I'm not
bugging you about coming home,</i>

23:33.829 --> 23:34.913
<i>but I was just wondering.</i>

23:34.914 --> 23:36.998
I don't know.
I gotta go to Baltimore tomorrow.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.626
<i>To do what?</i>

23:40.961 --> 23:43.255
Uh, I got to see somebody.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.673
I was thinking about, um,
painting the kitchen.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.343
What color do you like?

23:49.428 --> 23:50.803
Will, are you there?

23:50.804 --> 23:55.225
Uh, I don't know, paint it --
let's paint it yellow.

23:55.392 --> 23:58.561
Yellow's kind of a bad color for me.
I'll look green at breakfast.

23:58.562 --> 24:01.648
- Blue, <i>then.</i>
- I don't know about blue.

24:01.649 --> 24:05.486
Look, paint the damn room
battleship grey, what do I care?

24:08.155 --> 24:09.657
I'm sorry.

24:10.741 --> 24:13.159
Look, when I get back,
we'll go to the paint store together,

24:13.160 --> 24:15.579
and we'll get some chips,
and we'll figure out...

24:16.413 --> 24:19.707
Look, will, I don't know why
I'm talking trivia.

24:19.708 --> 24:23.545
I called to tell you that I love you
and I miss you.

24:24.505 --> 24:28.132
And I'm --
you're doing the right thing.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.927
And it's costing you, too,
i know that.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.262
I'm here.

24:32.429 --> 24:36.683
I'm right here, and I'll be here
whenever you come home.

24:36.684 --> 24:39.310
I'll meet you if you need me to...

24:39.311 --> 24:41.020
Anywhere.

24:41.021 --> 24:42.731
Anytime.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.651
That's what I called to tell you.

24:49.238 --> 24:50.614
Molly...

24:52.116 --> 24:54.034
I love you.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.288
Goodnight.

25:38.787 --> 25:43.291
That's the same atrocious aftershave
you wore in court three years ago.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.293
Yeah, I keep getting it
for Christmas.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.799
Did you get my card?

25:51.800 --> 25:53.593
I got it. Thank you.

25:53.594 --> 25:55.345
And how is officer Stewart?

25:55.512 --> 25:57.305
The one who was first
to see my basement.

25:57.306 --> 25:58.598
Stewart's fine.

25:58.599 --> 26:00.933
Emotional problems, I hear.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.394
Do you have any problems, will?

26:02.603 --> 26:04.062
No.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.272
No, of course you don't.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.026
I'm glad you came.

26:11.028 --> 26:13.405
My callers are mostly
clinical psychologists

26:13.614 --> 26:16.115
from cornfield universities
somewhere.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.117
Second-raters, the lot.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.079
Dr. bloom showed me
your article on surgical addiction

26:20.245 --> 26:21.913
<i>in the journal of clinical psychiatry.</i>

26:21.914 --> 26:24.082
- And?
- Very interesting.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.585
- Even to a layman.
- Layman?

26:27.669 --> 26:29.754
A layman?

26:29.755 --> 26:31.839
An interesting term.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.633
So many experts
on government grants.

26:33.634 --> 26:36.136
And you say, you're a layman?

26:37.346 --> 26:39.890
But it was you who caught me,
wasn't it, will?

26:40.933 --> 26:43.059
- Do you know how you did it?
- What does it matter now?

26:43.060 --> 26:45.813
It doesn't matter to me, will.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.982
I want you to help me, Dr. lecktor.

26:49.983 --> 26:52.193
Yes, I thought so.

26:52.194 --> 26:54.112
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.321
Yes?

26:55.322 --> 26:57.741
- You read about it?
- In the papers.

26:57.908 --> 27:00.119
I don't tear out the articles.

27:00.285 --> 27:03.872
I wouldn't want them to think
i was dwelling on anything morbid.

27:06.667 --> 27:08.919
You want to know
how he's choosing them, don't you?

27:09.461 --> 27:12.004
- I thought you might have some ideas.
- Why should I tell you?

27:12.005 --> 27:14.382
You'd get to see the file
on this case.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.843
- And there's another reason.
- Pray tell.

27:16.844 --> 27:18.469
Thought you might be curious to see

27:18.470 --> 27:19.971
if you're smarter
than the person I'm looking for.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.056
Then, by implication,
you think you're smarter than me,

27:22.057 --> 27:22.932
since you caught me.

27:22.933 --> 27:25.685
No. I know that I'm not smarter
than you.

27:25.686 --> 27:28.104
- Then how did you catch me, will?
- You had disadvantages.

27:28.105 --> 27:29.355
What disadvantages?

27:29.356 --> 27:31.483
You're insane.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.487
You are very tan, will.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.782
Your hands are rough.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.702
They don't look
like cop's hands anymore.

27:42.703 --> 27:45.288
And that shaving lotion
is something a child would select.

27:45.289 --> 27:48.041
It has a ship on the bottle,
doesn't it?

27:50.169 --> 27:52.336
Don't think you can persuade me
with appeals

27:52.337 --> 27:53.838
to my intellectual vanity.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.133
I don't think
I'll persuade you at all.

27:56.842 --> 27:59.261
You'll either do it or you won't.

27:59.928 --> 28:02.681
Besides, we have Dr. bloom
working on it, and he's the best.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.267
- Do you have the file with you?
- Yes.

28:05.434 --> 28:06.934
- Pictures?
- Yes.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.561
Let me have them,
and I might consider it.

28:08.562 --> 28:10.606
No.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.568
Dream much, will?

28:15.569 --> 28:17.445
Goodbye, Dr. lecktor.

28:17.446 --> 28:21.033
You haven't threatened
to take away my books yet.

28:22.993 --> 28:26.455
Let me have the file,
and I'll tell you what I think.

29:27.808 --> 29:30.226
This is a very shy boy, will.

29:30.227 --> 29:32.144
What were their yards like?

29:32.145 --> 29:34.146
Big back yards.

29:34.147 --> 29:37.275
Fences, hedges. Why?

29:37.276 --> 29:39.318
Because, my dear will,

29:39.319 --> 29:42.572
if this pilgrim imagines
he has a relationship with the moon,

29:42.739 --> 29:45.908
he might go outside to look at it.

29:45.909 --> 29:48.661
Have you ever seen blood
in the moonlight, will?

29:48.662 --> 29:51.247
Appears quite black.

29:51.248 --> 29:52.873
If one were nude,

29:52.874 --> 29:56.460
it would be better to have privacy
for this sort of thing.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.379
That's interesting.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.506
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.

30:00.507 --> 30:01.924
I considered it.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.301
You came here to look at me,

30:03.302 --> 30:05.344
to get the old scent back again,
didn't you?

30:05.345 --> 30:06.637
I want your opinion.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.264
I don't have one right now.

30:08.265 --> 30:11.100
Well, when you have one,
I'd like to hear it.

30:11.101 --> 30:13.311
- Can I keep this?
- I haven't decided yet.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.562
I'll study them.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.356
When you get more files,
I'd like to see them, too.

30:16.523 --> 30:17.607
You can call me.

30:17.774 --> 30:20.109
When I have to call my lawyer,
they bring me a telephone.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.612
Would you like to leave me
your home phone number?

30:23.780 --> 30:24.990
No.

30:26.575 --> 30:28.284
Do you know
how you caught me, will?

30:28.285 --> 30:29.118
Goodbye, Dr. lecktor.

30:29.119 --> 30:30.369
You can leave messages for me
at the number on the file.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.662
Do you know how you caught me?

30:33.206 --> 30:37.084
The reason you caught me, will,
is we're just alike.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.503
Do you understand?

30:40.380 --> 30:42.549
Smell yourself.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.129
Gotcha.

32:03.380 --> 32:06.716
<i>217 now boarding at gate 12.</i>

32:06.883 --> 32:09.510
<i>Eastern airlines, flight 217</i>

32:09.511 --> 32:13.098
<i>is now ready for boarding at gate 12.</i>

32:19.229 --> 32:20.939
Get up against the bunk
and face the wall.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.900
Don't turn around,
or I'll mace you in the face.

32:38.498 --> 32:41.793
Thank you so much.
I'll call you when I'm finished.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.303
<i>Are you ready for your call?</i>

32:52.304 --> 32:53.763
Yes, thank you.

32:56.057 --> 32:58.767
<i>Paltrow,
Christiansen & golub, law offices.</i>

32:58.768 --> 33:00.479
Excuse me.
I must have misdialed.

33:10.030 --> 33:11.655
<i>Thank you for using at&t.</i>

33:11.656 --> 33:13.783
<i>This is operator 24.</i>

33:13.950 --> 33:18.037
Operator, I don't have
the use of my arms.

33:18.038 --> 33:20.289
Would you be so kind as to, uh...

33:20.290 --> 33:22.042
Dial a number for me, please?

33:22.209 --> 33:23.876
<i>Certainly. What's the number?</i>

33:23.877 --> 33:28.877
Area code 301, 555-6624.

33:33.220 --> 33:35.888
<i>The university of Chicago,
department of psychiatry.</i>

33:35.889 --> 33:37.848

<i>He's not in,
but I'll connect you to his office.</i>

33:40.268 --> 33:41.685
What's his secretary's name again?

33:41.686 --> 33:44.564
<i>Uh, Martha king.
Just a moment, please.</i>

33:45.857 --> 33:48.317
- Martha king's desk.
- Hi, Martha.

33:48.318 --> 33:50.820
<i>Martha doesn't come in nights.</i>

33:51.571 --> 33:53.155
Maybe you can help me.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.323
This is Bob greer

33:54.324 --> 33:55.824
of Blaine & Edwards
publishing company.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.826
Dr. bloom asked me to send a copy

33:57.827 --> 33:59.912
of <i>the psychiatrist and the law
to</i> someone.

33:59.913 --> 34:02.373
Martha never sent me
the address and phone number.

34:02.374 --> 34:03.833
<i>She'll be in in the morning.</i>

34:04.000 --> 34:06.502
Well, I've got to catch
federal express

34:06.503 --> 34:07.586
in about five minutes.

34:07.587 --> 34:08.712
I'd be immensely appreciative

34:08.713 --> 34:10.840
if you could pull it out
of her rolodex for me.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.174
<i>I don't see a rolodex.</i>

34:12.175 --> 34:14.802
I'll bet she has a call caddy
right next to her phone.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.888
- Yeah...
- Well, zip that little pointer

34:17.097 --> 34:18.848
right on down to the letter g.

34:19.014 --> 34:20.431
<i>All right.</i>

34:20.433 --> 34:23.601
The name we're looking for,
the last name Graham,

34:23.603 --> 34:25.646
the man the book
is supposed to be sent to,

34:25.647 --> 34:27.815
a Mr. will Graham.

his home address there, too.

34:36.366 --> 34:40.453
<i>3680 desoto highway,

34:41.288 --> 34:44.623

34:47.752 --> 34:49.795
I've finished.

36:30.397 --> 36:31.563
<i>Mom!
Oh, my gosh..</i>

36:31.564 --> 36:33.942
It's all right.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

36:48.915 --> 36:51.543
<i>we are beginning our descent

36:56.339 --> 36:58.716
Yeah, this couple come down
from duluth.

36:58.717 --> 37:02.469
We was talking them down
the short-term mortgages.

37:02.470 --> 37:07.392
And I'm figuring, "gee, Andy,
you're gonna unload this Turkey."

37:08.601 --> 37:12.521
Well, and a squad car rolls up,

37:12.522 --> 37:15.899
and they start asking questions.

37:15.900 --> 37:19.027
Then the good old boys
give 'em the whole grand tour --

37:19.028 --> 37:21.613
who was lying where, and what.

37:21.614 --> 37:23.365
Terrific.

37:23.366 --> 37:28.287
So, they get in their sedan deville
and get the hell out of here.

37:28.288 --> 37:30.831
Any single men
ask to see the house?

37:30.832 --> 37:32.292
Haven't asked me.

39:29.325 --> 39:32.494
<i>You used a cutting tool
on the branch, so that you could see.</i>

39:32.495 --> 39:37.250
<i>Then you passed the time
whittling and dreaming.</i>

39:39.377 --> 39:44.377
<i>When night came, you saw them
pass by their bright windows.</i>

39:44.966 --> 39:48.135
<i>Then you watched
the shades go down,</i>

39:48.136 --> 39:51.597
<i>then you saw the lights go out,
one by one.</i>

39:51.598 --> 39:53.724
<i>Then, after a while,
you climbed down</i>

39:53.725 --> 39:55.976
and you went in to them, didn't ya?

39:55.977 --> 39:57.519
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?

39:57.520 --> 40:00.106
You watched them
all goddamned day long!

40:03.484 --> 40:06.654
That's why houses with big yards.

40:10.116 --> 40:11.950
<i>I need the firearms
and tool marks section</i>

40:11.951 --> 40:13.201
out here on a severed branch.

40:13.202 --> 40:15.120
I need to know
what kind of cutting tool he used.

40:15.121 --> 40:17.664
And then I need bowman
in documents to fall on this carving.

40:17.665 --> 40:19.833
- Is <i>it weird?</i>
- The mark? Yeah.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.628
If documents can't do the carving,
I'll send it up to Langley.

40:22.629 --> 40:24.588
<i>Did price get an identification
off the Leeds print?</i>

40:24.589 --> 40:26.590
No, price hasn't found him
in the index yet.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.176
<i>It's a hand search.
He's got half his department on it.</i>

40:29.177 --> 40:31.887
Listen will, have you seen
this week's tattler?

40:32.639 --> 40:34.265
It's not on my preferred reading list,
Jack.

40:34.432 --> 40:38.018
Yeah, well, uh, your picture's
all over the front page.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.272
Who the hell was it? Lounds?

40:41.439 --> 40:42.773
Of course. Who else?

40:42.774 --> 40:44.733
God damn it, Jack!

40:44.734 --> 40:48.404
I promised Molly!
I promised her!

40:49.489 --> 40:50.906
Come in.

40:50.907 --> 40:54.034
- Dr. chilton?
- Yes?

40:54.035 --> 40:56.161
When we were cleaning out
Dr. lecktor's cell,

40:56.162 --> 40:58.080
he heard us coming
and hid something in a book.

40:58.081 --> 40:59.790
We got him out of there
and dug around.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.208
- Is that it?
- Yes.

41:01.209 --> 41:03.252
Put it down on my desk, bonner.

41:11.594 --> 41:13.262
Has anyone else seen this
except you?

41:13.429 --> 41:14.931
No.

41:18.059 --> 41:19.977
<i>Special agent Crawford's office.</i>

41:19.978 --> 41:22.980
This is Dr. chilton. I need to speak
to Mr. Graham right away.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.273
<i>He's not here,
he's in Birmingham.</i>

41:24.440 --> 41:26.692
<i>Special agent Crawford
is on the line with him now.</i>

41:26.693 --> 41:28.778
Will you please tell them
this is very, very urgent.

41:28.945 --> 41:30.655
I'll hold on.

41:33.616 --> 41:34.950
Dr. chilton, it's Jack Crawford.

41:34.951 --> 41:36.618
You have will Graham
on the line, too.

41:36.619 --> 41:39.705
<i>I have a note,
or two pieces of a note</i>

41:39.706 --> 41:42.499
that appears to be from that man
who killed those people in Atlanta.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.335
Dr. chilton, where did you get it?

41:44.502 --> 41:46.962
In Hannibal lecktor's cell.
It was hidden in a book.

41:46.963 --> 41:48.755
<i>Dr. chilton,
don't touch the note.</i>

41:48.756 --> 41:50.048
<i>Can you read it to us?</i>

41:50.049 --> 41:52.843
It's written on toilet tissue.

41:52.844 --> 41:56.263
"My dear Dr. lecktor,
i wanted to tell you

41:56.264 --> 41:58.808
I am delighted that you've taken
an interest in me.

41:59.350 --> 42:03.270
<i>I know that you alone
can understand what I am becoming.</i>

42:03.271 --> 42:07.566
You alone know the people I use
to help me in these things

42:07.567 --> 42:10.402
are only elements
undergoing change

42:10.403 --> 42:14.364
to fuel the radiance
of what I am becoming,

42:14.365 --> 42:18.368
just as the source of light
is burning.

42:18.369 --> 42:21.747
I have a collection
of your press clippings.

42:21.748 --> 42:24.708
I think they are absurd,
as are mine.

42:24.709 --> 42:26.335
'The tooth fairy,'

42:26.502 --> 42:28.879
what could be more inappropriate?

42:28.880 --> 42:31.673
Investigator Graham interests me,

42:31.674 --> 42:33.800
very purposeful-looking.

42:33.801 --> 42:36.345
I hope we can correspond."

42:36.512 --> 42:38.138
Mr. Graham,
there's a piece missing here.

42:38.139 --> 42:39.807
Now I'll read the bottom part.

42:40.516 --> 42:42.392
"After I hear back from you,

42:42.393 --> 42:44.603
I might send you something wet."

42:44.604 --> 42:47.023
Signed "avid fan".

42:47.607 --> 42:50.150
It has teeth marks
pressed into it at the bottom.

42:50.151 --> 42:52.027
Sarah, order a chopper,
next thing smoking.

42:52.028 --> 42:53.278
I don't care whose it is.

42:53.279 --> 42:54.780
Two, call Alabama air national guard

42:54.781 --> 42:56.698
and tell 'em to get Graham
back here right now.

42:56.699 --> 42:58.867
Then call documents
and tell them to scramble a team.

42:58.868 --> 43:01.037
I want everybody moving
five minutes ago. You understand?

43:01.204 --> 43:03.872
<i>I have a documents team
on its way to you by helicopter</i>

43:03.873 --> 43:04.831
<i>to pick up the note.</i>

43:04.832 --> 43:05.957
Listen, after we've worked the note,

43:05.958 --> 43:07.418
I want to replace it
in lecktor's cell.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.419
I don't want lecktor to know
that we've found it.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.129
He might try to warn
the killer somehow.

43:11.130 --> 43:13.382
- Where's lecktor now?
- Holding <i>cell.</i>

43:13.549 --> 43:15.926
How long can you keep him in there
without him getting suspicious?

43:15.927 --> 43:17.803
<i>Three, four hours.</i>

43:17.804 --> 43:19.930
Brian, we have a note coming in
on the flight,

43:19.931 --> 43:22.433
possibly from the tooth fairy,
number one priority.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.352
It has to go to hair and fiber,
latent prints, and then documents.

43:25.353 --> 43:27.395
Will Graham and i
will be walking it through.

44:06.018 --> 44:10.397
One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.

44:10.398 --> 44:14.109
- And a couple of blue grains.
- Work the hair.

44:14.110 --> 44:16.278
Do we have
the negative comparison?

44:16.279 --> 44:18.363
Hair from lecktor's comb,

44:18.364 --> 44:20.449
whiskers from lecktor's razor
they let him use.

44:20.616 --> 44:23.828
This is, uh, hair
from the security guard.

44:45.016 --> 44:47.100
How many guys
handled this without gloves?

44:47.101 --> 44:48.644
The guard, cleanup man, lecktor.

44:48.811 --> 44:50.896
The cleanup man scrubbing sinks

44:50.897 --> 44:54.274
probably had the oil
washed off his fingers.

44:54.275 --> 44:55.943
But the others...

44:56.194 --> 44:58.196
One smudge.

45:01.949 --> 45:04.493
Those aren't ridges.
It's just the texture of the paper.

45:05.161 --> 45:06.661
I can fume for a print,

45:06.662 --> 45:08.747
but can't guarantee
the iodine stains would fade out.

45:08.748 --> 45:11.124
- Ninhydrin? Boost it with heat?
- No.

45:11.125 --> 45:13.501
We couldn't wash it after.

45:13.502 --> 45:15.212
I can't get a print off this

45:15.213 --> 45:16.881
in the time you've got
to get it back, will.

45:17.465 --> 45:19.591
<i>- How long do I have?
- Twenty minutes, Max.</i>

45:19.592 --> 45:21.051
The main thing
to find out is,

45:21.052 --> 45:23.470
how was lecktor
supposed to reply to him?

45:23.471 --> 45:25.305
Which is probably
the missing section,

45:25.306 --> 45:28.308
because at the top it says,
"i hope we can correspond,"

45:28.309 --> 45:30.311
then comes the gap.

45:31.687 --> 45:35.357
This note was written in ballpoint,
but it looks like lecktor

45:35.358 --> 45:38.276
went over this area
with a felt-tip pen,

45:38.277 --> 45:40.404
then tore it away.

46:08.808 --> 46:11.434
You're so sly,

46:11.435 --> 46:13.896
but so am I.

46:20.403 --> 46:24.072
The aniline dyes used in the ink
of the felt-tip pens,

46:24.073 --> 46:27.367
like lecktor used,
are transparent to infrared.

46:27.368 --> 46:31.038
The tooth fairy's ballpoint isn't.

46:38.379 --> 46:41.590
This looks like the tip of a t
here, here, and here.

46:41.757 --> 46:44.926
At the end is what could be
the top of an r.

46:44.927 --> 46:47.012
There's three ts and an r
in "tattler".

46:47.013 --> 46:49.639
We know our boy reads it.
The article about me and lecktor.

46:49.640 --> 46:52.059
I don't know anybody else
that's carried that.

46:52.935 --> 46:54.812
Personal ads.

46:57.773 --> 47:00.401
We believe the tooth fairy
told lecktor to reply to him

47:00.568 --> 47:03.486
through the personal ad section
of the national tattler.

47:03.487 --> 47:05.488
The Chicago office
is down there right now

47:05.489 --> 47:06.656
running through their ads.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.950
We have cut
into a line of communication

47:08.951 --> 47:11.078
between the tooth fairy
and lecktor.

47:11.245 --> 47:13.955
If we find lecktor's reply,
we plan to pull it,

47:13.956 --> 47:15.874
substitute it with one of our own.

47:15.875 --> 47:18.835
And this is what the tooth fairy
will read. Bill?

47:18.836 --> 47:20.046
"Dear avid fan,

47:20.212 --> 47:22.881
inherit my mantle
and surpass my achievements.

47:22.882 --> 47:26.259
Mementoes for you
at Baltimore central left luggage.

47:26.260 --> 47:28.970
Ticket number 72683."

47:28.971 --> 47:32.349
It's a secret service letter drop.
We plan to stake it out.

47:32.350 --> 47:34.351
When he shows, we'll grab him.
Anything from Chicago?

47:34.352 --> 47:37.312
- Not yet.
- When do they go to press?

47:37.313 --> 47:38.647
Thirty-five minutes.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.399
- Christ.
- Let's get to the physical.

47:40.566 --> 47:42.400
There was no print.

47:42.401 --> 47:44.235
Scale counts and core size
of the hair

47:44.236 --> 47:46.696
match the blond hair
found in the jacobis'.

47:46.697 --> 47:49.616
That note was written by your man.

47:49.617 --> 47:52.410
Aside from the hair,
three blue grains, dark flecks,

47:52.411 --> 47:53.578
went to Brian's end.

47:53.579 --> 47:56.206
The grains are commercial
granulated cleanser with chlorine,

47:56.207 --> 47:57.290
from the cleaning man.

47:57.291 --> 47:59.502
Several particles of dried blood,
but not enough to type.

48:01.921 --> 48:03.963
<i>This is Chester.
Who am I talking to?</i>

48:03.964 --> 48:05.341
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.

48:05.508 --> 48:07.718
<i>Got a personal ad
with "avid fan" in it</i>

48:07.885 --> 48:09.386
<i>being telexed to you right now.</i>

48:09.387 --> 48:11.221
<i>- Read</i> it.
<i>- "Dear avid fan,</i>

48:11.222 --> 48:13.139
<i>you honor me.
You're very beautiful."</i>

48:13.140 --> 48:14.307
<i>Jack". Oh, Christ.</i>

48:14.308 --> 48:17.102
<i>"I offer 100 prayers
for your safety.</i>

48:17.103 --> 48:22.103
<i>Find help in galatians 6:11, 15:2,</i>

48:22.108 --> 48:26.737
<i>acts 3:3, revelations 18:7,</i>

48:26.904 --> 48:31.199
<i>Jonah 6:8, John 6:22,</i>

48:31.200 --> 48:33.284
<i>Luke 1:7."</i>

48:33.285 --> 48:34.869
<i>Jack". Thanks.</i>

48:41.127 --> 48:44.671
Jimmy, did you get anywhere at all
identifying him off the Leeds' prints?

48:44.672 --> 48:45.881
Not yet.

48:49.718 --> 48:50.761
Photography at Langley?

48:50.970 --> 48:53.764
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.

49:07.486 --> 49:10.697
No. And our ad has to go out
in the same book code lecktor used,

49:10.698 --> 49:12.574
or he'll know it wasn't lecktor
talking to him.

49:12.575 --> 49:13.616
Book code?

49:13.617 --> 49:14.743
"100 prayers" could be
the page number,

49:14.910 --> 49:17.412
the paired numbers could be
line and letter. But what book?

49:17.413 --> 49:18.746
<i>- Not the Bible?
- No.</i>

49:18.747 --> 49:21.374
Galatians 15:2.
Galatians only has six chapters.

49:21.375 --> 49:24.043
The same with Jonah 6:8.
Jonah only has four chapters.

49:24.044 --> 49:26.629
Lecktor was not using the Bible.

49:26.630 --> 49:28.214
Then the tooth fairy
probably named the book

49:28.215 --> 49:29.466
in the part lecktor tore out.

49:29.467 --> 49:31.468
Right.

49:31.469 --> 49:33.219
What about sweating lecktor?

49:33.220 --> 49:35.096
They tried sodium amytal on him
three years ago

49:35.097 --> 49:36.765
to find where he buried
a Princeton student.

49:36.932 --> 49:38.558
Gave them a recipe
for potato chip clip.

49:38.559 --> 49:40.643
Wonderful.

49:40.644 --> 49:42.437
The tooth fairy
would have named a book

49:42.438 --> 49:44.272
he knew lecktor has access to.

49:44.273 --> 49:46.191
He'd know it from articles
he'd read about lecktor.

49:46.192 --> 49:47.442
Willingham,
when he tossed his cell,

49:47.443 --> 49:49.569
took polaroids so they can
get everything back in place.

49:49.570 --> 49:52.447
Have him meet me
with pictures of lecktor's books.

49:52.448 --> 49:54.783
<i>- Where?
- Library of congress.</i>

50:00.623 --> 50:02.791
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.

50:03.918 --> 50:05.794
Lecktor's ad runs as is,
we decode it later.

50:06.003 --> 50:07.504
Or... we pull it,

50:07.505 --> 50:09.756
figure out the code,
and run our own ad next week.

50:09.757 --> 50:12.175
And lose a week? We got 17 days
till the next full moon.

50:12.176 --> 50:15.679
And I don't like lecktor's ad runnin'
without knowing what it says.

50:17.431 --> 50:20.100
It's your call, will.

50:22.269 --> 50:24.395
Run it.

50:24.396 --> 50:25.856
And what if it encourages
the tooth fairy

50:26.023 --> 50:28.525
to do something else beside write?

50:28.526 --> 50:30.818
We'll all feel sick
for a very long time.

50:30.819 --> 50:33.405
And if bowman
still can't figure it out?

50:34.240 --> 50:35.698
Then we'll bait him
with something else

50:35.699 --> 50:36.825
in next week's tattler.

50:36.992 --> 50:39.036
What, for instance?

50:41.205 --> 50:42.706
Me.

50:43.916 --> 50:46.377
I don't think that's a very good idea.

50:50.130 --> 50:52.799
Why not?
Don't you think we can provoke him?

50:52.800 --> 50:55.260
Maybe. Maybe he can be provoked.

50:55.261 --> 50:57.680
What I was thinking about is you.

50:58.806 --> 51:00.848
You're getting deeper and deeper
into this.

51:00.849 --> 51:02.267
Good night.

51:02.268 --> 51:03.226
Sidney.

51:03.227 --> 51:05.229
I'll talk to you, will. Okay?

51:06.438 --> 51:07.522
Last time you did that

51:07.523 --> 51:11.276
you did a real good job
of pushing yourself all out of shape.

51:11.277 --> 51:14.195
You try it on again
or you go through some big trauma,

51:14.196 --> 51:16.281
you could relapse, my friend.

51:16.282 --> 51:18.783
Sidney, don't worry about me.

51:18.784 --> 51:22.954
I'm working the evidence,
making moves. That's all.

51:22.955 --> 51:24.873
I'm fine.

51:26.834 --> 51:28.877
Bowman just struck out.

51:29.044 --> 51:32.422
- It is not books in lecktor's cell.
- Price?

51:32.423 --> 51:34.424
He just heard. It's a bust-out.

51:34.425 --> 51:36.802
As evidence, the Leeds print
will get us a conviction

51:36.969 --> 51:38.678
if we could ever find the guy.

51:38.679 --> 51:42.307
But he must never have been printed
because he is not in our index.

51:42.308 --> 51:45.060
We are not gonna identify him
off the print.

51:48.230 --> 51:50.232
I'll use lounds.

51:50.858 --> 51:52.692
What for?

51:52.693 --> 51:54.485
Our boy doesn't read
the new <i>York</i> times

51:54.486 --> 51:55.194
literary supplement.

51:55.195 --> 51:58.032
<i>He</i> reads <i>lounds</i> in <i>the tattler.</i>

52:02.828 --> 52:04.078
What else should we cover?

52:04.079 --> 52:07.040
He put the shorts on Charles Leeds
after he was dead.

52:07.041 --> 52:10.544
I believe he did this to make sure
we wouldn't think he was gay.

52:14.214 --> 52:16.883
He's molested
all of his male victims.

52:16.884 --> 52:20.386
He may be impotent with members
of the opposite sex.

52:20.387 --> 52:22.639
Our forensic psychologists
have projected,

52:22.640 --> 52:24.474
though I'm not sure,

52:24.475 --> 52:27.727
that he may have had
sexual relations with his mother.

52:33.275 --> 52:36.653
So, how long do you plan
to stay in Washington?

52:36.654 --> 52:37.945
Till we've taken out the tooth fairy.

52:37.946 --> 52:40.239
Can the tattler rely on
gettin' the straight stuff from you?

52:40.240 --> 52:41.324
Absolutely.

52:41.325 --> 52:43.952
How does working on this case
affect your sex life?

52:44.119 --> 52:47.497
Mine? It doesn't affect mine,
it affects yours. Go fuck yourself.

52:47.498 --> 52:50.667
- Look, pal of mine, you're news.
- Shoot the pictures.

52:50.668 --> 52:52.335
All right, stimy, let's shoot 'em.

52:52.336 --> 52:53.795
I'm in the shots with Graham.

52:53.796 --> 52:55.547
<i>- What?
- I'm in the shots with you.</i>

52:55.714 --> 52:57.841
Come on, you want this
to look real or not?

53:00.219 --> 53:01.844
Make sure the theater sign
across the street

53:01.845 --> 53:03.388
is just slightly out of focus.

53:03.389 --> 53:05.306
We want him to be able to read it
so he can find it,

53:05.307 --> 53:06.683
but we don't want
to look too obvious.

53:06.684 --> 53:08.559
You make sure that I look excellent.

53:08.560 --> 53:09.852
All right, shoot it.

53:11.397 --> 53:12.480
One more.

53:12.481 --> 53:14.732
- One more.
- That's enough.

53:14.733 --> 53:17.568
Okay, Graham.
Hey, always nice, huh?

53:17.569 --> 53:19.237
Let's have lunch,
call my service.

53:19.238 --> 53:21.572
Crawford, always a thrill.

53:21.573 --> 53:25.202
Dr. bloom. I need them on my desk
in two hours. Okay?

53:33.544 --> 53:36.004
- Did bowman break the code yet?
- No.

53:36.171 --> 53:37.630
Tools and firearms say

53:37.631 --> 53:39.382
the cutting tool
used on the severed branch

53:39.383 --> 53:41.634
was a common bolt cutter.

53:41.635 --> 53:44.345
I got a call from Asian studies
at Langley.

53:44.346 --> 53:46.264
- The mark you found on the tree?
- Yeah?

53:46.265 --> 53:50.309
It's a Chinese character considered
a lucky sign in gambling.

53:50.310 --> 53:53.396
That same character appears
on a mah jongg piece.

53:53.397 --> 53:57.151
It means "red dragon".
Mean anything to you?

53:59.445 --> 54:00.738
No.

54:01.530 --> 54:04.365
I'm having the bureau
fly Molly up tonight.

54:04.366 --> 54:05.491
Huh?

54:05.492 --> 54:07.953
Well, she said she can get away
for one night.

54:09.121 --> 54:10.705
I do something wrong?

54:10.706 --> 54:12.707
No, it's just the setting, Jack.

54:12.708 --> 54:14.793
- Hm.
- Thanks.

54:17.588 --> 54:19.590
If he shows, and he's smart,

54:19.757 --> 54:22.508
he'll approach you
from the front, pass, turn,

54:22.509 --> 54:24.469
try and take you from behind.

54:24.470 --> 54:26.596
- How's your hearing?
- It's good.

54:26.597 --> 54:27.930
You'll wear a wire, one-way.

54:27.931 --> 54:30.100
We'll hear you,
you won't hear us.

54:31.059 --> 54:33.561
You checked out a charter arms
.44 special bulldog?

54:33.562 --> 54:34.104
Yeah.

54:34.271 --> 54:36.648
Load these in it.
You ever fire 'em?

54:36.815 --> 54:39.317
- Glaser safety slugs.
- Yeah. Number 12 shots.

54:39.318 --> 54:41.986
Suspended in liquid teflon
in a copper casing.

54:41.987 --> 54:44.822
On impact it all opens up
in the target.

54:44.823 --> 54:46.991
Guaranteed one-shot stop.

54:46.992 --> 54:49.995
- You got body armor?
- Yeah, kevlar second chance.

54:50.746 --> 54:51.913
I hope you get one.

54:51.914 --> 54:54.666
'Cause he's gone for the head shot
eight out of eleven times?

54:56.335 --> 54:58.545
Let's walk the route.

55:06.637 --> 55:08.096
<i>United flight 849 to Newark</i>

55:08.263 --> 55:10.348
<i>is now boarding at gate 7.</i>

55:10.349 --> 55:14.102
<i>United flight 849 to Newark
is now boarding at gate 7.</i>

55:49.471 --> 55:51.682
You didn't cancel the food.

55:56.311 --> 55:58.522
So, where are things?

55:59.857 --> 56:02.900
We got nine days left.

56:02.901 --> 56:05.070
We're working on it, doing stuff.

56:06.780 --> 56:09.741
You don't want to talk about
what you're doing, do you?

56:14.663 --> 56:16.582
Hotel rooms...

56:17.708 --> 56:19.167
Illicit romance.

56:21.545 --> 56:23.755
We have to stop meeting like this.

56:30.053 --> 56:32.680
Remember the first time we met?

56:32.681 --> 56:34.182
Yeah.

56:34.349 --> 56:37.019
When we were alone together
in that room.

56:38.562 --> 56:40.146
Even though
I'd never seen you before,

56:40.147 --> 56:43.691
we were sitting there, speaking.

56:43.692 --> 56:46.027
And something flickered
across your face like a shadow.

56:46.028 --> 56:48.029
I said, "what's that?"

56:48.030 --> 56:50.198
Mm-hmm.

56:50.365 --> 56:52.159
Remember what you said?

56:55.662 --> 56:58.290
I said, "this is too good to live."

57:04.755 --> 57:07.174
Time is luck, will.

57:08.926 --> 57:11.762
I know the value of every single day.

58:46.648 --> 58:48.817
Someone's coming.

59:18.889 --> 59:20.766
Go!

59:26.688 --> 59:29.066
Don't! Don't move!

59:34.446 --> 59:36.280
Take the money!

59:36.281 --> 59:38.616
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

59:38.617 --> 59:41.078
- Clear!
- Clear!

59:48.543 --> 59:50.294
What you moving
in slow motion for, man?

59:50.295 --> 59:51.713
I'm being mugged!

59:52.547 --> 59:55.341
For real. Can you believe that?

59:55.342 --> 59:57.427
Pay up-

59:57.594 --> 01:00:01.389
<i>...in sports, the cubs lost again.</i>

01:00:01.556 --> 01:00:03.183
Hey!

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:45.433
You know who I am?

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.562
Mm-hm. I don't want to know
who you are.

01:00:49.771 --> 01:00:52.773
According to you,
I'm a sexual pervert.

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:55.026
"An animal," you said.

01:00:58.029 --> 01:01:00.448
You know who I am now?

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.577
Yes.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.372
Do you feel privileged?

01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:13.378
I'm very scared.

01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:18.592
Open your eyes.

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:21.636
Mr. lounds, you're a reporter.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:25.472
Your job is to report.
That's why you're here.

01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:27.057
And if you don't open your eyes,

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:29.978
I'll staple your eyelids
to your forehead.

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:42.157
Well... here I... am.

01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:01.050
Look at the screen.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:03.428
William Blake's
the <i>great</i> red <i>dragon</i>

01:02:03.595 --> 01:02:05.971
<i>and the woman clothed
in the rays of the sun.</i>

01:02:05.972 --> 01:02:08.516
- Do you see?
- Yes.

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:12.394
Mrs. Leeds. Do you see?

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.104
Yes.

01:02:14.105 --> 01:02:17.316
Mrs. jacobi. Do you see?

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:18.818
Yes.

01:02:20.695 --> 01:02:22.488
The next family as they will look

01:02:22.489 --> 01:02:23.948
when I go to visit them.

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:25.867
<i>- Do you see?
- Yes.</i>

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:32.624
Freddie lounds, your photograph.

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:35.334
- No.
- No, what?

01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:38.546
No. Not me, please.

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:41.091
- Please.
- Are you a man?

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:43.801
Yes.

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:46.345
Do you imply that I'm queer?

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:48.473
God, no.

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:52.601
Before me, you are a slug in the sun.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.311
You are privy to a great...

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:56.855
Becoming,
and you recognize nothing.

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:59.567
You are an ant in the afterbirth.

01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:04.655
It is your nature
to do one thing correctly, tremble.

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:06.574
But fear is not what you owe me.

01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:12.080
No, lounds, you and the others,
you owe me awe.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:21.131
We have one more
piece of work to do.

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:26.302
If he takes off the mask,
i am a dead man.

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.185
Open your eyes.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.940
- Open your eyes!
- Ah.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.402
You will read this...
In the tape recorder.

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:46.030
Go.

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:48.324
"I have had a great privilege.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:52.661
I have seen with wonder and awe
the strength of the red dragon.

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:55.081
All I wrote about him were lies.

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:57.041
Will Graham made me write them

01:03:57.042 --> 01:04:00.878
to pull him into a trap
in Washington, district of Columbia.

01:04:00.879 --> 01:04:03.339
Will Graham, you will learn
from my own lips

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:07.009
how much you have to dread
because I was forced to lie.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:10.346
He will be more merciful to me
than to you.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:14.933
You will lie awake in fear
of what the red dragon will do.

01:04:14.934 --> 01:04:18.520
I will be a testament
to the truth of this."

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:27.447
You did very well.

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:32.243
Will you let me go now? Please?

01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:35.038
You will tell the truth?

01:04:35.747 --> 01:04:37.582
I promise.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.251
Good.

01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:47.467
We'll seal your promise with...

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:11.074
We'll seal your promise...

01:05:16.204 --> 01:05:18.248
...with a kiss.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:28.090
<i>Man on radio". We'll be showing
five possible answers</i>

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:29.425
<i>to the questions I'll be asking.</i>

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:31.260
<i>Any member of a team

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.470
<i>but if incorrect, then the other team

<i>to answer that very same question.</i>

<i>The team with the most points

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:38.976

<i>...will also compete in the right

<i>Uh, questions in round number one

01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:51.447
<i>Okay, that means
the round is all over.</i>

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:53.782
<i>So, Jane we're all ready.
Help us with round one.</i>

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:56.286
<i>All right, Bob, the first
category today is the far east.</i>

01:05:56.494 --> 01:06:01.457
<i>And the choices are Vietnam,
Japan, Laos, Thailand, and China.</i>

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.517
Bowman, just skip the cryptography
and tell me

01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:23.104
what the hell it says, okay?

01:06:24.022 --> 01:06:27.066
- Did he try to say anything at all?
- No, he sure didn't.

01:06:32.363 --> 01:06:34.114
He never regained
consciousness.

01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:35.699
<i>- Did you hear the tape?
- Yeah.</i>

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.201
Listen, bowman just broke the code

01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:39.536
that lecktor used
in the tattler personal ad.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:41.580
It was the state of Maryland
statutes.

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:43.332
You need to know what it said
right now.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:45.667
- What?
- Listen to me.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:48.086
Everything is okay.
I've taken care of it.

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:52.091
What is it, Jack?

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:54.928
The bastard gave him
your home address.

01:06:55.595 --> 01:06:58.555
It said, "Graham home,
3860 desoto highway,

01:06:58.556 --> 01:07:00.099
captiva, Florida.

01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:02.602
Save yourself. Kill them all."

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:06.147
- Get me a plane.
- Will! Will.

01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:08.358
Will.

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:12.236
Mom.

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:14.321
Huh?

01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:15.656
What time... what?

01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:17.658
S-someone's outside.

01:07:17.659 --> 01:07:18.867
They're noises.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:21.538
<i>- Where?
- Outside.</i>

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:34.884
<i>Mom...</i>

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:37.845
Go back to your room
and close the door.

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:43.017
- Mom...
- Do it, now.

01:08:30.773 --> 01:08:32.566
Ma'am, are you all right?

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:34.694
What? What is it?

01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:39.488
What is it?
What's going on?

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:41.575
Ma'am, I think
you should come back inside.

01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:43.827
- What's going on?
- Come back inside. Please.

01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:46.747
I think you should come back inside.

01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:30.375
I'm sorry, Molly.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.087
I'm sorry about all of this.

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:40.551
This place is fine.
We'll be fine.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:43.929
He's after you now, isn't he?

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:45.890
It's just a precaution.

01:09:46.724 --> 01:09:49.977
Kevin, why don't you run down
to the water, check out the clock?

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.479
I want to hang around here.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.691
- I'm in the kitchen, mom.
- Okay.

01:09:58.152 --> 01:09:59.821
What is that about?

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:04.575
What, he's afraid
to leave you alone with me now?

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:07.744
He saw the article
in the tattler, right?

01:10:07.745 --> 01:10:08.996
I wanted to talk with him about it,

01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:12.624
but he said he wanted
to bring it up to you, face to face.

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:14.626
Good for him.

01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:16.378
Kevin, come on,
help me unpack, will ya?

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:18.589
Then we'll go get some groceries.

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:32.060
You and mom are very well-protected,
you know.

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:34.354
No one's gonna find out
where you are.

01:10:34.355 --> 01:10:37.983
Is there anything
i need to know to see about mom?

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:39.901
No.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:42.738
This guy is trying to kill us?

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:44.740
We don't know that.

01:10:44.741 --> 01:10:47.201
When are you going to kill him?

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:53.165
I'm not.

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.585
It's only my job to find him.

01:10:58.838 --> 01:11:00.798
Barry's mom had this newspaper.

01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:03.885
It said you were
in a special hospital.

01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:08.847
Well, it was a regular hospital,

01:11:08.848 --> 01:11:11.809
then I was transferred
into the psychiatric wing.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.897
That bothers you, doesn't it?

01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:19.024
I don't know.

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:22.903
Was it because in the papers it said
it was this man lecktor?

01:11:22.904 --> 01:11:24.863
Mm-hm.

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:26.783
What happened?

01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:30.494
Well, lecktor was attacking
college girls,

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:32.704
then he killed them.

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.457
How?

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:38.252
In bad ways.

01:11:40.087 --> 01:11:42.547
He was a psychiatrist.

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:46.928
One of the girls was his patient,
and I went to talk to him about her.

01:11:49.388 --> 01:11:53.517
I tried to build feelings
in my imagination like the killer had

01:11:53.518 --> 01:11:56.103
so that I would know
why he did what he did,

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:58.523
because that would help me find him.

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:03.068
When I was sitting
in lecktor's office and I looked up,

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:04.820
I saw a book on his shelf.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:07.823
It had pictures of war wounds in it.

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:09.951
And I knew it was him.

01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:15.747
So I went to a pay phone
down the hall to call the police,

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:18.042
and that's when he attacked me.

01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:24.673
You and mom,

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:28.052
came to see me in the hospital,
and that helped a lot.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:31.847
But after my body got okay,

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:36.143
I still had his thoughts
going around in my head.

01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:40.439
And I stopped talking to people.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.985
And a doctor friend of mine,
a Dr. bloom,

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:47.028
asked me to get some help.

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:49.114
And I did.

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:53.286
Then after a while, I felt better,
and I was okay again.

01:12:56.956 --> 01:13:00.126
And the way he thought
felt that bad?

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:03.044
Kevin,

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:05.882
they're the ugliest thoughts
in the world.

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:24.483
So, what kind of coffee do you like?

01:13:25.943 --> 01:13:27.194
Huh?

01:13:27.361 --> 01:13:30.488
You like that folgers stuff, right?

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:31.657
Yeah.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.869
Mom likes that, too.

01:13:38.331 --> 01:13:40.666
When can we go home, dad?

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:44.128
I don't know, Kevin.

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:02.104
So, where are things?

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.690
Nowhere.

01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:10.237
Everything we've tried is either
a dead end or it's backfired.

01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:12.197
Crawford's already planning
the next crime scene

01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:14.158
so that we get it fresh.

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:20.538
We've got about six more days
till the next full moon.

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.916
Can you quit?

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:24.627
No.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:29.548
What's next?

01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:35.513
- I go to Atlanta.
- Crawford?

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.223
No.

01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:43.521
I have to be alone.

01:14:47.066 --> 01:14:49.025
You're talking about doing
exactly what you said you...

01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:53.823
This killing, it's gotta stop.

01:15:20.933 --> 01:15:23.184
William, you're gonna
make yourself sick

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.646
or get yourself killed.

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:37.450
You and Kevin should go to Montana.

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:39.618
Go see your dad.

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:42.204
He hasn't seen Kevin
for a long time.

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:46.667
And I'll come up
and get you afterwards.

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:17.281
Hi, this is <i>Valerie Leeds.</i>

01:16:17.448 --> 01:16:20.284
<i>Sorry I can't come
to the phone right now.</i>

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:25.498
- I'm sorry, too.
- Excuse me.

01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:28.042
Coffee.

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:40.012
It's just you and me now, sport.

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:44.683
I'm gonna find you, god damn it.

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:06.746
- Mr. dollarhyde?
- Ah, Eileen.

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:09.290
Bill told me to tell you
there was a variation

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:11.459
in the gamma of number three.

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:14.004
But he caught it in time.

01:17:17.508 --> 01:17:18.759
Eileen, uh...

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:22.930
Good. Good.

01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:19.820
- Who's there?
- Mr. dollarhyde.

01:18:19.987 --> 01:18:22.280
I came about the low-light
infrared emulsion.

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:24.408
Oh, yeah.
Come on in, it's safe.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:33.958
Put your back against the door.

01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:36.377
And there's a stool
just to your right.

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:39.340
You're the production controller
from admin, right?

01:18:40.174 --> 01:18:42.884
Can you give me an idea
of the conditions?

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:45.970
Um, shooting from maybe eight feet.

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:47.972
<i>- I can't use any lights.
Mm-hm.</i>

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:50.309
Okay, what's being photographed?

01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:53.228
The activities of nocturnal animals.

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:55.480
When do you need it?

01:18:55.481 --> 01:18:56.523
Four days.

01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:59.485
Okay, let me stick this
in the black hole.

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:08.368
1000-c infrared sensitive
has to be handled in total darkness.

01:19:08.369 --> 01:19:10.328
Remember to be very careful with it.

01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:13.831
But still, it's easier to handle
than the 1200 series.

01:19:13.832 --> 01:19:15.208
It'll be fine.

01:19:15.209 --> 01:19:16.209
In case you're wondering,

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:19.087
I keep the samples straight
by touch code.

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:21.340
I-i wasn't wondering.

01:19:22.341 --> 01:19:23.883
Reba, I gotta fly.

01:19:23.884 --> 01:19:25.635
Maybe Mr. dollarhyde
can drive you home tonight?

01:19:25.636 --> 01:19:27.595
No, that's okay.
I'll take care of myself.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:29.847
- I can change things around.
- No, thanks, go on.

01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:31.767
Okay.

01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:37.606
- No, I'll take you.
- No, thanks.

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:41.526
I'll order you 1200 feet of 1000-c
in the morning.

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:43.528
- Ride with me.
- Thanks, but I'll take the bus.

01:19:43.529 --> 01:19:46.531
I do it all the time.

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:47.616
Ride with me.

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:50.452
It would be because
i would like you to.

01:19:52.204 --> 01:19:55.457
Okay, sure.
Let me get my stuff on.

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:59.128
How did you come to gateway?

01:19:59.336 --> 01:20:00.962
Oh, they had to hire the handicapped

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:02.880
to shape up
their employment practices

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:05.633
to get this defense contract.

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:07.260
You worked out well.

01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:10.555
Yeah, well, everybody they hired did.

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:12.599
You know, you speak very well.

01:20:12.766 --> 01:20:15.226
Although you avoid
fricatives and sibilants.

01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:16.936
At the riker institute for the blind,

01:20:16.937 --> 01:20:20.482
I trained in therapy for speech-
and hearing-impaired children.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.652
I'll probably go back to it someday.

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:26.195
Mm-hm.

01:20:26.196 --> 01:20:28.364
You know, if you don't want to talk,
that's okay.

01:20:28.365 --> 01:20:29.407
But I hope you will,

01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:31.200
because you're very direct,
and I like that,

01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:33.245
and I like what you have to say.

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:36.957
May I touch your face?

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:40.501
I want to know whether
you're smiling or frowning.

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:41.502
I guess I...

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:44.423
I guess I want to know
whether I should be quiet or not.

01:20:50.888 --> 01:20:54.432
Take my word for it.
I'm smiling.

01:20:54.433 --> 01:20:57.061
I didn't mean to offend you.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.563
On the way,
can I take you somewhere?

01:21:00.564 --> 01:21:02.690
Where?

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.651
It would be my surprise.

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:07.780
Okay, sure.

01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:26.714
- Are you apprehensive?
- No.

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:29.676
The very protective Mr. dollarhyde
over there is watching us.

01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:32.303
No, no, I want to.

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:35.182
In about two hours,
we're going to cap his tooth.

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:36.659
Yeah.

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:38.745
It's warm.

01:22:52.926 --> 01:22:55.304
Back a little bit. There.

01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:59.558
- You hear it?
- Yeah.

01:23:26.585 --> 01:23:30.796
You... rearrange the dead families
into an audience

01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:32.758
to see what you do.

01:23:34.051 --> 01:23:37.721
You think that what you do will
make you into something different.

01:23:38.472 --> 01:23:40.432
You are becoming.

01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:45.103
What is it you think you're becoming?

01:23:48.065 --> 01:23:51.360
The answer is in the way
you use the mirrors.

01:23:56.156 --> 01:23:59.451
What do the mirrors
make you dream you're becoming?

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:35.654
A little to your left.

01:24:42.869 --> 01:24:45.664
Francis, that was a great dinner.
Thank you.

01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:50.501
I made you a gin and tonic.
It's right in front of you.

01:24:50.502 --> 01:24:51.670
Oh.

01:24:53.046 --> 01:24:54.881
What are you watching?

01:24:56.341 --> 01:24:58.635
Oh, it's just a little homework.

01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:07.537
Mmm.

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:32.312
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, d.

01:26:44.491 --> 01:26:47.368
# Is there a fire in the sky? #

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:48.911
Your heart's loud.

01:26:48.912 --> 01:26:51.206
# Is there a moon up there? #

01:26:51.373 --> 01:26:53.416
If you'll hold me...

01:26:53.417 --> 01:26:56.628
# Is anything alive now? #

01:26:57.462 --> 01:27:00.674
# This darkness is what I hear #

01:27:02.217 --> 01:27:06.345
# this is a breathless silence #

01:27:06.346 --> 01:27:09.516
# a moment out of time #

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:13.352
# I see your face in the shadows #

01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:18.483
# the tell-tale signs
are in your eyes #

01:27:19.276 --> 01:27:22.446
# aching with a passion inside #

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:27.074
# deep as the river #

01:27:27.075 --> 01:27:30.536
# all desire #

01:27:30.537 --> 01:27:33.998
# the ashes and the fire #

01:27:33.999 --> 01:27:37.669
# turning this night inside #

01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:41.256
# and the light from you #

01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:01.818
# is there a flame in the dark? #

01:28:03.403 --> 01:28:06.490
# Is there a bright heart star? #

01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:11.077
# These creatures
look the same now #

01:28:11.244 --> 01:28:14.998
# we freeze wherever we are #

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:20.753
# we wake alone in the blackness <i>I</i>

01:28:20.754 --> 01:28:24.132
# we sleep wherever we fall #

01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:28.136
# one dream all around us #

01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:32.599
# this big hush infects us all #

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:37.103
# forever in this half-light #

01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:40.689
# all desire #

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:44.151
# the ashes and the fire #

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:48.030
# turning this night inside #

01:28:49.533 --> 01:28:51.743
# and the light from you #

01:28:54.412 --> 01:28:58.207
# all desire #

01:28:58.208 --> 01:29:01.585
# the ashes and the fire #

01:29:01.586 --> 01:29:05.340
# turning this night inside #

01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:08.969
# and the light from you #

01:29:30.657 --> 01:29:32.951
<i>- Is that you, d?
- Are you okay?</i>

01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:34.661
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:29:36.288 --> 01:29:37.580
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:40.917
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:45.462
Well, you know,
if you show me where things are,

01:29:45.463 --> 01:29:46.505
I'll make us some coffee.

01:29:46.506 --> 01:29:48.091
No, no, uh...

01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:52.596
- Don't go back inside the house.
- Why? I left my purse inside.

01:29:53.513 --> 01:29:55.932
I'll get it. It's okay.

01:29:58.184 --> 01:30:00.895
# Deep as the river #

01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:02.230
# all... #

01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:05.525
I mean,
you should stay outside, it's...

01:30:06.610 --> 01:30:09.237
It's 'cause you look so good
in the sun.

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:12.699
Okay.

01:30:17.954 --> 01:30:19.748
Um...

01:30:20.373 --> 01:30:22.417
When, uh...

01:30:25.503 --> 01:30:27.881
Reba, when can I see you again?

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:31.009
Oh, um...

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:35.013
Hey, we could meet at my house.

01:30:48.193 --> 01:30:50.110
<i>You got
the message lecktor called?</i>

01:30:50.111 --> 01:30:51.780
Yeah. I arranged for him
to have a phone.

01:30:51.947 --> 01:30:53.489
I gotta call him in a few minutes.

01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:55.658
<i>Good. Listen, we identified
the tire tracks left</i>

01:30:55.659 --> 01:30:57.786
<i>when lounds was delivered
back to the</i> tattler.

01:30:57.994 --> 01:31:02.331
<i>G-7816 goodyear truck tires.
Looks like our boy drives a Van.</i>

01:31:02.332 --> 01:31:05.459
<i>I'm setting up our base in Chicago.
When are you coming back?</i>

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:07.420
When I'm done, Jack.

01:31:23.937 --> 01:31:25.854
Yeah, this is will Graham of the FBI.

01:31:25.855 --> 01:31:28.733
Dr. chilton arranged for me
to talk to Dr. lecktor.

01:31:33.446 --> 01:31:35.073
Hello?

01:31:36.992 --> 01:31:39.118
<i>Hello, will.</i>

01:31:39.119 --> 01:31:41.996
<i>I wanted to congratulate you
for the job you did on Mr. lounds.</i>

01:31:41.997 --> 01:31:43.831
I admire that enormously.

01:31:43.832 --> 01:31:46.542
Oh, what a cunning boy
you are, will.

01:31:46.543 --> 01:31:48.711
I'm sick of you
crazy sons of bitches, lecktor.

01:31:48.712 --> 01:31:50.587
You got something to say, say it.

01:31:50.588 --> 01:31:53.007
<i>Lecktor". I want to help you.</i>

01:31:53.008 --> 01:31:55.300
<i>You'd be more comfortable
if you relax with yourself.</i>

01:31:55.301 --> 01:31:57.594
<i>We don't invent our natures,
they're issued to us,</i>

01:31:57.595 --> 01:32:01.724
<i>along with our lungs, and pancreas,
and everything else.</i>

01:32:01.725 --> 01:32:04.018
<i>Why fight it?</i>

01:32:04.019 --> 01:32:05.686
Fight what?

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:07.271
<i>Did you really feel
so depressed</i>

01:32:07.272 --> 01:32:11.108
<i>after you shot
Mr. Garrett Jacob hobbs to death?</i>

01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:14.653
<i>I didn't know you then,
but I think you probably did.</i>

01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:17.156
But it wasn't the act
that got you down, was it?

01:32:17.157 --> 01:32:20.368
Didn't you really feel so bad
because killing him felt so good?

01:32:20.535 --> 01:32:22.704
And why shouldn't it feel good?

01:32:22.871 --> 01:32:26.708
<i>It must feel good to god.
He does it all the time.</i>

01:32:27.625 --> 01:32:29.626
God's terrific.

01:32:29.627 --> 01:32:32.129
He dropped a church roof
on 34 of his worshippers

01:32:32.130 --> 01:32:33.797
last Wednesday night in Texas

01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:37.009
as they were groveling
through a hymn to his majesty.

01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:39.763
<i>Don't you think that felt good?</i>

01:32:43.433 --> 01:32:45.685
Why does it feel good, Dr. lecktor?

01:32:46.728 --> 01:32:51.231
It feels good, will,
because god has power.

01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:54.402
And if one does
what god does enough times,

01:32:54.569 --> 01:32:58.239
<i>one will become as god is.</i>

01:33:02.869 --> 01:33:04.620
<i>God's a champ.</i>

01:33:04.621 --> 01:33:06.497
<i>He always stays ahead.</i>

01:33:06.498 --> 01:33:10.793
<i>He got 140 filipinos
in one plane crash last month.</i>

01:33:10.794 --> 01:33:13.922
<i>Remember that earthquake in Italy
last spring?</i>

01:33:16.925 --> 01:33:18.885
<i>I enter.</i>

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:24.098
<i>The glass cutter.</i>

01:33:24.099 --> 01:33:27.059
<i>The piece of glass I take out
is mine.</i>

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:29.020
<i>The house is mine.</i>

01:33:46.579 --> 01:33:49.623
<i>I walk up these stairs,</i>

01:33:49.624 --> 01:33:52.210
<i>I pass the children's toys.</i>

01:33:52.877 --> 01:33:55.130
<i>Children mean nothing to me.</i>

01:33:55.797 --> 01:33:57.506
<i>They were put here to help me.</i>

01:34:01.845 --> 01:34:03.471
<i>I move to the door.</i>

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.644
<i>I step into the room.</i>

01:34:14.023 --> 01:34:16.109
I see you there.

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:21.656
And I see me desired by you.

01:34:24.033 --> 01:34:29.033
Accepted and loved

01:34:29.247 --> 01:34:34.627
in the silver mirrors of your eyes.

01:35:06.492 --> 01:35:11.492
# Father, look in my eyes #

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:17.040
# see me as I really am #

01:35:20.048 --> 01:35:23.175
# you made me #

01:35:23.176 --> 01:35:26.553
# now take me #

01:35:26.554 --> 01:35:28.932
I'm gonna talk
to fogel tomorrow...

01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:35.563
# Tell me how it feels now #

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:40.730
# behold your flesh
has come of age #

01:35:44.113 --> 01:35:45.447
Wait a minute.

01:35:45.448 --> 01:35:52.330
# Forsake me, you break me #

01:35:54.499 --> 01:35:57.042
# strong as I am #

01:35:57.043 --> 01:36:00.921
# there's something about this thing
that scares me #

01:36:00.922 --> 01:36:03.257
# strong as I am #

01:36:03.258 --> 01:36:06.843
# there's something about this thing
that dares me #

01:36:06.844 --> 01:36:09.138
# strong as I am #

01:36:09.305 --> 01:36:12.516
# there's something about this thing
that haunts me #

01:36:12.517 --> 01:36:15.185
# strong as I am #

01:36:15.186 --> 01:36:22.068
# there's something about this thing
that taunts me #

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:28.783
# mother, let me heal you #

01:36:29.826 --> 01:36:34.826
# your pain has lasted far too long #

01:36:38.126 --> 01:36:44.716
# release it, it kills you #

01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:48.176
What was it?

01:36:48.177 --> 01:36:49.845
- Pollen.
- Oh.

01:36:49.846 --> 01:36:51.430
- Thanks for the ride.
- See you tomorrow.

01:36:51.431 --> 01:36:53.599
Yeah.

01:36:53.766 --> 01:36:58.766
# Your love you would not share #

01:37:01.941 --> 01:37:05.820
Mr. dollarhyde.
What are you doing here?

01:37:12.702 --> 01:37:15.246
# Strong as I am #

01:37:15.413 --> 01:37:18.874
# there's something about this thing
that scares me #

01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:22.003
# strong as I am #

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:27.007
- Who is it?
- It's me.

01:37:27.008 --> 01:37:30.385
- Who? Who is it?
- It's me.

01:37:30.386 --> 01:37:32.429
Oh.

01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:34.640
- Francis?
Knob-i

01:37:35.475 --> 01:37:37.560
not Francis.

01:37:38.811 --> 01:37:41.105
Francis is gone.

01:37:41.939 --> 01:37:44.984
Francis is gone forever.

01:37:53.659 --> 01:37:55.994
So, what are we doing?

01:37:55.995 --> 01:37:57.663
The dream.

01:37:58.790 --> 01:38:02.209
He dreams about being wanted
and desired,

01:38:02.210 --> 01:38:06.296
so he changes people into beings
who want and desire him.

01:38:06.297 --> 01:38:09.383
- Changes?
- It's a word.

01:38:09.384 --> 01:38:13.179
Killing and arranging the people
to imitate it.

01:38:14.138 --> 01:38:16.556
And lecktor told me something.

01:38:16.557 --> 01:38:19.268
If one does what god does
enough times,

01:38:19.435 --> 01:38:21.687
one will become as god is.

01:38:21.854 --> 01:38:23.730
You put it together, you get,

01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:28.527
if our boy imitates being wanted
and desired enough times,

01:38:28.528 --> 01:38:30.363
he believes he will become one

01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:33.074
who is wanted, and desired,
and accepted.

01:38:33.324 --> 01:38:34.951
It'll all come true.

01:38:39.288 --> 01:38:41.249
But he doesn't take anything.

01:38:42.250 --> 01:38:44.376
There's no souvenirs
taken from the houses.

01:38:44.377 --> 01:38:47.964
He needs souvenirs or trophies
to re-live the event.

01:38:51.759 --> 01:38:55.137
Maybe he records it somehow...

01:38:55.138 --> 01:38:59.308
So he could see himself accepted
over, and over, and over again.

01:39:02.353 --> 01:39:05.188
Vtrs, polaroids, stills, what?

01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:06.524
How do I know?

01:39:09.152 --> 01:39:10.945
How does he find 'em?

01:39:12.155 --> 01:39:14.656
When we find out how he found them,
we'll find him.

01:39:14.657 --> 01:39:16.951
There is no connection
between the two families.

01:39:17.118 --> 01:39:18.744
We've clone a dozen computer runs.

01:39:18.953 --> 01:39:21.371
Jack, all the women
have a bloom on them.

01:39:21.372 --> 01:39:23.748
He didn't win them in a lottery,
he picked these women.

01:39:23.749 --> 01:39:26.085
There's selection and design
in his choices.

01:39:26.377 --> 01:39:29.130
Look, admit we struck out
this month.

01:39:29.297 --> 01:39:32.048
The lear jet is standing by,
the basic lab stuff is on it.

01:39:32.049 --> 01:39:34.384
You, zeller, Jimmy price,
the photographer,

01:39:34.385 --> 01:39:37.345
anywhere he hits, we can be there
in an hour and 15 minutes.

01:39:37.346 --> 01:39:38.513
We get the call, we roll.

01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:40.557
The scene will be fresh,
fresher than we've ever had it.

01:39:40.558 --> 01:39:42.018
- It's not over yet.
- Oh, for Christ's sake!

01:39:42.185 --> 01:39:43.728
It's a foregone conclusion.

01:39:43.936 --> 01:39:47.355
It's 11:30 P.M., the full moon
is happening tonight.

01:39:47.356 --> 01:39:50.025
Give it up! Forget this month,
it's too damn late!

01:39:50.026 --> 01:39:51.443
I gave it up.

01:39:51.444 --> 01:39:53.404
Till you showed up with pictures
of two dead families,

01:39:53.571 --> 01:39:54.863
knowing goddamn well

01:39:54.864 --> 01:39:57.574
that I'd imagine families
three, four, five, and six, right?

01:39:57.575 --> 01:39:59.784
You're fucking right I did,
and I'd do it again!

01:39:59.785 --> 01:40:01.745
Great! But don't talk to me
about late, pal.

01:40:01.746 --> 01:40:03.289
I'll tell you
when it's too fucking late!

01:40:03.456 --> 01:40:06.918
Until then, we go as late
as I want to take it!

01:40:25.019 --> 01:40:26.479
A padlock.

01:40:32.777 --> 01:40:35.487
That's why the bolt cutter.

01:40:35.488 --> 01:40:36.655
What's that?

01:40:36.656 --> 01:40:38.657
He used a bolt cutter
to trim away the branch

01:40:38.658 --> 01:40:40.325
when he was watching
from the woods.

01:40:40.326 --> 01:40:42.702
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter
on the garage door?

01:40:42.703 --> 01:40:45.331
Because a deadbolt was there
when they were killed.

01:40:49.377 --> 01:40:53.129
Donald jacobi's 12th birthday party
was April 14.

01:40:53.130 --> 01:40:54.966
Sometime between
April 14 and August 1

01:40:55.132 --> 01:40:56.466
they changed the lock.

01:40:56.467 --> 01:40:59.220
But he thought
there was a padlock there.

01:41:06.435 --> 01:41:07.853
From the street,

01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:10.480
you can't see the glass
in the Leeds' kitchen door.

01:41:10.481 --> 01:41:12.524
There's a big, high fence there.

01:41:12.525 --> 01:41:14.402
But he was ready
with his glass cutter.

01:41:16.779 --> 01:41:20.448
So either he was casing far ahead

01:41:20.449 --> 01:41:24.120
and we didn't check back far enough,

01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:27.665
or!!!

01:41:29.584 --> 01:41:31.711
- We checked.
- Don't talk.

01:41:35.339 --> 01:41:36.423
Metcalfe, it's Graham.

01:41:36.424 --> 01:41:39.135
Is the Leeds and jacobi stuff
still in the storeroom?

01:41:40.052 --> 01:41:42.345
Have the guard down there call me.

01:41:42.346 --> 01:41:43.848
Do it.

01:41:51.772 --> 01:41:54.442
You know that's the jacobis' cat.

01:41:56.861 --> 01:42:00.281
You brought a bolt cutter 'cause
you thought there was a padlock.

01:42:02.992 --> 01:42:04.410
The Leeds' dog
doesn't have a collar,

01:42:04.577 --> 01:42:07.705
but you know it's the Leeds' dog,
don't you, my man?

01:42:10.041 --> 01:42:12.208
See the woman?

01:42:12.209 --> 01:42:14.420
The bloom on the woman?

01:42:16.297 --> 01:42:19.300
You can see her again and again
anytime you want.

01:42:21.177 --> 01:42:25.180
Doggie doesn't have a collar,
but you know it's the Leeds' dog.

01:42:25.181 --> 01:42:27.725
And the jacobi cat.

01:42:28.559 --> 01:42:30.936
And the padlock on the door.

01:42:33.105 --> 01:42:36.484
And you know you need a bolt cutter
and every other goddamn thing

01:42:38.277 --> 01:42:41.572
because everything with you
is seeing, isn't it?

01:42:43.574 --> 01:42:46.451
Your primary sensory intake

01:42:46.452 --> 01:42:50.080
that makes your dream live
is seeing.

01:42:50.081 --> 01:42:54.668
Reflections, mirrors,

01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:56.879
images...

01:43:05.429 --> 01:43:08.015
You've seen these films.

01:43:12.603 --> 01:43:14.814
Haven't you, my man?

01:43:22.154 --> 01:43:23.530
It's the guard in the storeroom.

01:43:23.531 --> 01:43:25.240
- The cans.
- What cans?

01:43:25.241 --> 01:43:26.991
The tapes were transferred
from home movies.

01:43:26.992 --> 01:43:28.536
Where's the packaging
the films came in?

01:43:28.703 --> 01:43:31.872
There's films of the families
in the document storage. Find them.

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:36.459
You got 'em?

01:43:36.460 --> 01:43:38.587
Are there any labels?

01:43:40.965 --> 01:43:43.800
Leeds can, gateway lab,
St. Louis, Missouri.

01:43:43.801 --> 01:43:46.803
The jacobi label will say
the same thing as the Leeds label.

01:43:46.804 --> 01:43:49.055
Gateway lab,
St. Louis, Missouri.

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:51.559
Who processed
the jacobi film?

01:43:53.978 --> 01:43:57.022
No. Bob's photo store, Birmingham.

01:43:57.189 --> 01:44:00.817
Stores send them out.
Have him peel the top label back.

01:44:00.818 --> 01:44:03.028
Is there a label underneath?

01:44:15.374 --> 01:44:17.960
It does, doesn't it?

01:44:59.251 --> 01:45:01.336
Where are you?
Are you here?

01:45:06.967 --> 01:45:09.427
You're scaring me with this!

01:45:09.428 --> 01:45:11.597
Will you just stop it?

01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:15.975
Francis,

01:45:15.976 --> 01:45:18.395
why are you doing this to me?

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:22.065
It's ugly!

01:45:22.066 --> 01:45:25.944
# Don't you know
that I'll always be true? #

01:45:25.945 --> 01:45:29.740
Are you in this room?
Where are you?

01:45:30.866 --> 01:45:33.077
You answer me!

01:45:34.286 --> 01:45:37.748
# And take my hand #

01:45:38.415 --> 01:45:42.377
# oh, won't you come with me #

01:45:42.378 --> 01:45:47.842
# and walk this land? #

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:54.890
# Please, take my hand #

01:46:03.023 --> 01:46:05.817
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at gateway.

01:46:05.818 --> 01:46:09.112
We don't have his name,
but we know he drives a Van.

01:46:09.113 --> 01:46:10.446
<i>Under "employee facilities,"</i>

01:46:10.447 --> 01:46:12.157
<i>I've got special stickers for vans.</i>

01:46:12.324 --> 01:46:15.035
<i>Yeah, I got 28, 29 Van permits
in the computer.</i>

01:46:15.202 --> 01:46:17.371
Start feeding me names.

01:46:18.163 --> 01:46:20.124
Is this lieutenant fisk?

01:46:20.416 --> 01:46:21.833
Will Graham.

01:46:21.834 --> 01:46:23.835
Listen, I need you to punch up
the driver's licenses

01:46:23.836 --> 01:46:25.837

Alvaro. A-l-v-a-r-o.
First name Joseph.

01:46:46.692 --> 01:46:48.443

Put it through the data-fax. Fast.

You guys better buckle up.

01:47:22.645 --> 01:47:24.897
We're on approach to lambert field.

01:47:40.704 --> 01:47:41.914
Fogel has four more names.

01:47:42.081 --> 01:47:44.332
He knows two, both dark hair,
third's a woman,

01:47:44.333 --> 01:47:47.211
fourth is a handicapped
parking permit.

01:47:49.421 --> 01:47:51.215
This is our man.

01:47:53.425 --> 01:47:55.969
Rural route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?

01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:57.679
From the airport,
you're a few minutes closer.

01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:01.975
We're 10-25 at the hark road
off ramp, highway 94.

01:48:01.976 --> 01:48:03.852
Let's

01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:37.070

01:49:37.071 --> 01:49:40.324

- Go on to the house.

01:49:49.166 --> 01:49:50.291
Will?

01:49:50.292 --> 01:49:51.793
Will?

01:49:51.794 --> 01:49:53.628
You're not gonna need that.

01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:56.673
A SWAT team
is gonna take him down, not us.

01:50:00.552 --> 01:50:01.804
Will?

01:50:05.641 --> 01:50:06.725
Will!

01:50:24.409 --> 01:50:25.994
This ought to be it right here.

01:50:26.161 --> 01:50:27.412
Kill your lights.

01:50:44.596 --> 01:50:46.389
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:49.184
Griffin's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the backup.

01:50:51.228 --> 01:50:53.855
Set up a roadblock
on route 3.

01:50:53.856 --> 01:50:57.859
Graham and I are in the trees
west of the house.

01:50:57.860 --> 01:50:59.819
How far away is the backup unit?

01:50:59.820 --> 01:51:02.447
I'm going around the back.
Stay in the trees.

01:51:42.446 --> 01:51:43.739
He's in there, Jack.

01:51:45.949 --> 01:51:48.994
And he's got somebody
in there with him.

01:52:09.473 --> 01:52:11.099
What?

01:52:13.268 --> 01:52:15.312
Will, what did you say?

01:52:21.902 --> 01:52:25.280
<i>Will.
Wait for the backup, will.</i>

01:52:25.530 --> 01:52:27.366
<i>Will!</i>

<i>Will.</i>

01:52:50.097 --> 01:52:51.974
Stop it.

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:57.145
Stop it!

01:54:34.659 --> 01:54:36.536

01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:03.665
It's okay.

01:56:06.835 --> 01:56:08.378
Who are you?

01:56:10.130 --> 01:56:11.965

01:56:13.633 --> 01:56:16.011
I'm will Graham.

01:56:58.094 --> 01:56:59.721
I'll get it, Ralph.

01:57:13.985 --> 01:57:15.779
What do you want?

01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:20.908
My name is will Graham.
I'm with...

01:57:20.909 --> 01:57:22.826
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, Jesus, right.

01:57:22.827 --> 01:57:25.038
- Come on in.

01:57:26.373 --> 01:57:27.832
No, that's all right.

01:57:29.167 --> 01:57:31.126
- You okay?
- We're fine.

01:57:31.127 --> 01:57:32.253
We're okay, yeah.

01:57:32.254 --> 01:57:34.589
Yeah, we're doing all right.
Thanks.

01:57:37.092 --> 01:57:38.384
Listen, um,

01:57:38.385 --> 01:57:40.719
that guy Crawford called
and he was telling me all about --

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:43.681
would you like to come in
and have a cup of coffee or a drink?

01:57:43.682 --> 01:57:45.809
- No, thank you.
- Listen, I want --

01:57:46.851 --> 01:57:49.020
I just stopped by to, uh...

01:57:50.355 --> 01:57:51.605
Listen, I want --

01:57:51.606 --> 01:57:54.317
I want to thank you. I-i...

01:57:56.111 --> 01:57:59.072
I just stopped by... to see you.

01:58:01.116 --> 01:58:02.158
That's all.

01:58:07.831 --> 01:58:12.831
# I can hear your heartbeat
knocking on the window #

01:58:14.254 --> 01:58:15.297

See the turtles?

01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:30.686
Wow!

01:58:30.687 --> 01:58:34.733
# Touch me like a hot ten
on my soul #

01:58:38.153 --> 01:58:39.737
