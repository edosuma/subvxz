WEBVTT

00:23.440 --> 00:26.902
- [breathes deeply]
- [man] What are you doing here, nigga?

00:35.369 --> 00:37.078
I'm not gonna ask you again.

00:40.081 --> 00:41.458
Young man...

00:42.834 --> 00:45.128
I've had a long day.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.339
I'm tired.

00:48.424 --> 00:50.426
But I'm not tired enough...

00:50.509 --> 00:53.845
to ever let nobody call me that word.

00:56.264 --> 00:59.518
You see a nigga standin' in
front of you? [breathing heavily]

00:59.601 --> 01:03.146
Across the street from a building named
after one of our greatest heroes?

01:04.147 --> 01:07.150
- [gun cocks]
- Yeah, a dead one.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.527
[Luke exhales]

01:09.778 --> 01:12.280
[theme music playing]

02:15.794 --> 02:20.117
<font color="#ffff00">encoded by</font>
<font color="##2AAE22">eMRaN92@TUT</font>

02:23.685 --> 02:25.896
[gunshots]

02:29.107 --> 02:30.776
[gunshot]

02:55.133 --> 02:59.095
[Scarfe] You're doing it
again. I hate it when you do that.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.182
Hate it when I do what?

03:02.265 --> 03:05.310
Stare at the photos like
they're about to start moving.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.437
They are talkin' and movin'.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.916
You just have to be still
enough to hear what they're sayin'.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.524
Whatever, Horton.

03:12.609 --> 03:16.321
A clue is a clue, no matter how small.

03:16.404 --> 03:18.448
This was deeply personal.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.492
Well, money invites the beast.

03:21.577 --> 03:23.490
There's nothing in Chico's jacket

03:23.490 --> 03:26.122
to suggest he was
capable of that type of violence.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.249
I don't think he has the stomach for it.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.920
Stomach? [sighs]

03:32.003 --> 03:34.798
There was vomit found at the junkyard.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.884
Inside it were fibers consistent
with that of a winter mask.

03:37.968 --> 03:41.387
One of the robbers didn't have
the heart to go through with it.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.265
My guess, it was babyface Chico.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.729
Uh, he was the last man standing.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.690
You mean to tell me Benjamin
Franklin was wrong?

03:52.608 --> 03:55.902
Well, in this case, it was all
about the Benjamins either way.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.696
[scoffs] Always is.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.907
Somebody got jacked, and
somebody got pissed...

04:00.991 --> 04:02.909
And somebody got dead.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.203
This ain't over yet.

04:17.757 --> 04:21.720
Eh, I just never got into Donald Goines.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.096
[chuckling] Are you crazy?

04:23.179 --> 04:26.892
Donald Goines was a street poet.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.394
- [Pop chuckles]
- [Luke] I didn't say Goines isn't.

04:29.477 --> 04:32.898
But Walter Mosley, George
Pelecanos? [clicks tongues] Boom.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.066
I bet you're into Richard Price.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.610
I dig Price.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.194
Dennis Lehane, too.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.447
What about Chester Himes?

04:41.531 --> 04:43.158
Without question.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.077
[clears throat] My biggest
beef with Donald Goines

04:46.161 --> 04:48.955
is that he wrote about
criminals and he died like one.

04:49.039 --> 04:52.918
[chuckles] You don't have
to get all Fox News about it.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.294
[Pop chuckling]

04:54.377 --> 04:56.587
Goines invented Kenyatta,

04:56.672 --> 04:59.049
the best black hero this side of Shaft.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.860
- [customer] Thank you, my brother.
- All right.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.303
- Keep that magic touch.
- I'll keep working on it.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.554
See you next week, Victor.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.891
So you're saying Kenyatta
is better than Easy Rawlins?

05:07.974 --> 05:09.392
I ain't saying all that.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.437
I'm just saying Kenyatta's my favorite.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.899
He took the fight to the man...

05:16.817 --> 05:19.194
in the streets by his self.

05:19.277 --> 05:22.447
Just like somebody else
could if he wasn't sweeping hair

05:22.530 --> 05:24.490
and washing dishes.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.534
[sighs] Don't start, Pop.

05:27.327 --> 05:31.206
The whole neighborhood is yapping
about how Zip and two goons

05:31.289 --> 05:34.459
got the beat down at
Genghis Connie's last night.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.794
Hmm.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.631
I heard it was four guys.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.427
[chuckling]

05:45.595 --> 05:47.388
I knew it had to be you.

05:49.265 --> 05:52.352
[chuckles] No wonder you came
into the shop so light on your feet.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.981
Either that or someone finally
gave you some trim.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.315
Oh!

05:58.358 --> 06:00.651
[both laugh]

06:02.653 --> 06:04.489
[Pop] Mmm. Mmm.

06:08.576 --> 06:12.247
So that's how it works? Those
thugs shake people down?

06:15.291 --> 06:17.836
They work for Mariah or Cottonmouth?

06:20.421 --> 06:21.422
[grunts]

06:26.386 --> 06:27.929
A little bit of both.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.348
They related?

06:30.431 --> 06:32.976
- Aunt and nephew?
- Cousins.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.728
Their grandma was Mama Mabel.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.688
Who's Mama Mabel?

06:37.773 --> 06:40.984
[sighs] The devil's ex-wife.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.113
They ever come at you sideways?

06:45.196 --> 06:46.823
No.

06:46.907 --> 06:50.493
This place right here is
Switzerland. Everybody knows that.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.747
Where you from, Luke?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.167
Chicago.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.377
You ain't from no Chicago.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.006
Where are you from, really?

07:05.926 --> 07:07.302
Savannah, Georgia.

07:07.844 --> 07:08.845
All right.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.597
Country boy.

07:11.681 --> 07:15.977
You know how the wind feels fluffy, like
you could stuff it into a pillowcase

07:16.061 --> 07:18.229
- right before a big thunderstorm?
- Mmm-hmm.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.523
Harlem's the same.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.400
Trouble smells a certain way.

07:22.483 --> 07:25.153
You can... touch it.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.572
Cottonmouth.

07:27.655 --> 07:30.784
He's gonna fall behind
lookin' for Chico.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.368
That's the way that works.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.537
Ain't no secrets uptown.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.500
I mean, you could set a watch by
the way that shit will play out.

07:40.501 --> 07:41.711
[scoffs]

07:41.795 --> 07:43.088
I'm fresh out of singles.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.631
- I ain't gonna break no ten for that.
- [laughs]

07:45.715 --> 07:47.550
[chuckles] Oh, no, no.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.385
- [door opens]
- [bell chimes]

08:10.949 --> 08:13.201
Something real about a razor.

08:15.411 --> 08:18.164
You should let me use my
clippers. You gonna bump up.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.166
Nah. [inhales deeply]

08:20.250 --> 08:21.709
Doesn't have the same feel.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.628
The clippers are idiot-proof.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.423
That's what's missin' nowadays, Pop.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.926
Attention to detail.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.804
Everyone wants things fast, quick.

08:33.889 --> 08:37.100
Me? I like to take my time.

08:37.851 --> 08:42.355
[Pop] Time is a luxury most...
working class men cannot afford.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.606
[Stokes] True.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.944
Time is precious. Shouldn't be wasted.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.739
Mmm...

08:51.822 --> 08:54.284
A good razor shave is
like a vacation to me.

08:55.493 --> 08:58.204
It's incredible how few
people take advantage.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.916
- [Pop] It's a lost art.
- [Stokes] Exactly.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.639
That's the problem
with these youngsters.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.210
They want it all.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.213
But they don't want to put in the work.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.966
They'll rob...

09:10.050 --> 09:13.428
lie, cheat, steal, just
to get what they want.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.347
Damn shame if you ask me.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.434
[softly] Yeah.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.519
- Shame.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:22.938 --> 09:25.899
How'd you... cut your hands?

09:25.982 --> 09:28.526
Oh, uh, eh... shaving.

09:28.609 --> 09:32.572
[chuckling] That's why I needed
a professional touch, you dig?

09:33.698 --> 09:35.951
- [Pop] Sorry, brother.
- Twelve feet.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.245
Two guns.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.831
Four seconds.

09:42.832 --> 09:43.959
You gonna move?

09:44.875 --> 09:46.294
No, not yet.

09:47.963 --> 09:50.881
Just 'cause they call you Bobby
Fish don't mean you're Bobby Fischer.

09:50.966 --> 09:52.968
And you ain't Turkish neither, Turk.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.510
Not last time I checked.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.346
[Turk] That's not what
your daughter said.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.472
[Bobby chuckling] Yeah,
but your mama confirmed it.

09:58.514 --> 10:01.118
[Turk] Oh, you think you can throw
me off my game talking about my mama?

10:01.142 --> 10:03.603
[Bobby] Oh, no, she
is a well-established ho.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.981
That should not faze you one bit.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.107
Check.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.074
That's a cheap broom.

10:16.824 --> 10:18.076
Old.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.663
I just got home.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.582
College?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.127
Three years this time...

10:27.210 --> 10:28.419
Seagate.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.630
I'm from 'round the way.

10:31.589 --> 10:32.966
Grew up right here.

10:34.550 --> 10:35.885
Everyone knows Pop.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.099
There was this little
Puerto Rican kid...

10:42.017 --> 10:44.769
I can't remember his
name... It's like, um...

10:44.852 --> 10:46.562
Rico or, uh...

10:47.522 --> 10:48.648
Chico.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.693
Yeah...

10:54.695 --> 10:56.156
Chico.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.785
He used to shape me up back in the day.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.455
He was real good, too.

11:06.874 --> 11:08.418
I was hoping he was still around.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.673
People come and go.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.007
You know how it is, right?

11:16.176 --> 11:17.385
Yeah.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.599
[Luke] Pop...

11:23.683 --> 11:25.810
I've got some fresh towels right here.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.646
You've got some dirty ones.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.690
I could take 'em out if you want.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.318
No sweat at all.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.530
I'm good, Luke.

11:37.613 --> 11:38.864
[Stokes] Big man...

11:40.158 --> 11:41.659
you work here, too?

11:43.828 --> 11:45.955
This brother got more
jobs than a Jamaican.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.957
- [laughing]
- [chuckles]

11:49.959 --> 11:51.294
[Stokes] What's your name again?

11:52.253 --> 11:54.089
- Luke.
- Luke. [snaps fingers]

11:54.172 --> 11:56.006
[inhales sharply] Mmm, old school.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.176
Biblical. [chuckles]

11:58.259 --> 12:00.010
I'm all about the old school.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.805
You know that...

12:02.888 --> 12:05.225
eye for an eye, tooth
for a tooth kind of thing.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.477
Fire and brimstone.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.605
[inhales sharply] See... back then...

12:11.647 --> 12:15.276
do someone wrong, wasn't
no beggin' and pleadin'.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.778
Just took care of it.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.157
Handled your business.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.162
What about turning the other cheek?

12:26.246 --> 12:27.413
Mmm...

12:28.331 --> 12:30.250
Jesus saves...

12:30.333 --> 12:31.667
I don't.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.838
You want a hot towel?

12:36.506 --> 12:38.716
Not today. [exhales]

12:38.799 --> 12:40.343
Gotta keep it movin'.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.679
I'm a working man, too.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.936
[Tone] Chico falls through...

12:51.020 --> 12:52.480
we need to holler at him.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.816
[Stokes] Thanks for the shave, Henry.

12:57.067 --> 12:59.028
I'm loyal to my people.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.448
[Luke] You're forgetting
something, Mr. Stokes.

13:08.371 --> 13:12.333
Unless your last name is
Corleone, Shaft or Riley...

13:12.917 --> 13:15.295
you owe my man $25.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.130
Don't worry about it, Cornell.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.177
Nah, it's all good.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.470
[Stokes chuckles]

13:26.556 --> 13:28.183
Tone, pay the man.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.395
[bell chimes]

13:46.742 --> 13:48.035
[door closes]

13:57.753 --> 13:59.422
They got Shameek.

14:00.465 --> 14:03.801
Cottonmouth did it personally.
Did you see his knuckles?

14:03.884 --> 14:05.595
I'm sorry, Pop.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.013
You never liked him anyway.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.390
That's not entirely true.

14:09.474 --> 14:12.768
Shameek is gone. I don't
condone what he did.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.313
But it's not too late for Chico.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.732
Pop, stay out of it.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.484
Some people you just gotta let go.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.611
I can't just turn my back on him.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.072
You used to find people, right?

14:26.115 --> 14:27.533
That was a long time ago.

14:27.617 --> 14:30.203
It ain't exactly a skill you lose.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.581
Look, this place is Switzerland.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.625
If we can find him before they do,

14:35.708 --> 14:39.212
maybe I can set up a
parley with Cottonmouth.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.885
I don't think so, man.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.054
I'm sorry, Pop. I can't do it.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.641
Hey... yes.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.518
You are sorry.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.313
Now, I hadn't seen
Reva since she was five.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.607
So when she comes
home with a convict husband

14:59.690 --> 15:01.984
and a shaky-ass story...

15:02.067 --> 15:03.819
I ain't ask her no questions.

15:03.903 --> 15:09.033
And when that same well-read ex-con
comes back wanting to be paid in cash...

15:09.116 --> 15:12.870
and lifting up refrigerators like
they're empty cardboard boxes,

15:12.953 --> 15:15.790
I just nodded my head again.

15:17.292 --> 15:21.462
What did you tell me about
keeping your secrets?

15:25.174 --> 15:26.884
That I owed you one.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.431
Well, time is due.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.561
I'm collecting.

15:43.859 --> 15:45.445
[indistinct chatter]

15:47.655 --> 15:48.656
[boy 1] Whoo!

15:49.907 --> 15:50.908
[boy 2] Hey!

15:56.121 --> 15:58.207
- [boy 3] Five-O! Five-O!
- [boy 4] Let's go!

15:58.291 --> 16:01.085
[Scarfe] Whoa! Hold
up... Hold up, hold up!

16:01.168 --> 16:02.396
[chuckling] Where's everybody goin'?

16:02.420 --> 16:04.505
Come on, Chauncey. You know the drill.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.093
Have you seen this kid? Chico?

16:10.303 --> 16:11.929
[Chauncey] No, I don't know that dude.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.222
Stop it.

16:15.350 --> 16:18.353
His initials are painted right here.

16:18.436 --> 16:21.314
Just like all the other St.
Nick playground legends.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.773
You seen him or not?

16:24.191 --> 16:25.192
Nah.

16:26.902 --> 16:29.196
Wastin' time, Misty.

16:29.279 --> 16:31.031
Yo, pass me the rock.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.658
[chuckling]

16:33.659 --> 16:35.495
What, you fittin' to
play one-on-one with me?

16:36.454 --> 16:39.374
No. That wouldn't be fair to you.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.000
[all exclaim]

16:41.083 --> 16:42.710
Come on, let's play H-O-R-S-E.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.796
Shot for shot. And if I win...

16:45.880 --> 16:50.092
you tell me everything I need to
know about Wilfredo Chico Diaz.

16:50.760 --> 16:51.969
What's in it for me?

16:53.429 --> 16:56.306
A get out of jail free
card for any non-violent felony.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.684
[scoffs] Not doin' that shit. No way.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.687
- [ball bounces]
- We good?

17:03.313 --> 17:05.023
[boy 1] Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.567
Ladies first.

17:06.651 --> 17:08.778
- [all exclaim]
- [boy 2] Come on, Chauncey.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.112
[Chauncey chuckles]

17:15.242 --> 17:17.369
[boy 2] Come on,
man. It's your thing, man!

17:18.579 --> 17:20.540
[indistinct chatter]

17:23.917 --> 17:26.671
Hey, you better shoot like
Cheryl Miller, not Barney Miller.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.174
Sometimes I forget how old you are.

17:31.187 --> 17:33.362
I mean, he gonna hold your purse, too?

17:33.386 --> 17:34.970
[all chuckling]

17:37.890 --> 17:39.266
Wow!

17:45.398 --> 17:47.692
[all exclaim]

17:50.903 --> 17:52.362
Come here.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.365
You see that?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.911
This is my court, too.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.540
Let's play.

18:04.792 --> 18:05.960
[all exclaim]

18:07.002 --> 18:09.714
- [boy 1] Oh, come on, now!
- [all exclaim]

18:15.928 --> 18:17.346
[inaudible]

18:56.927 --> 18:58.303
[men speaking indistinctly]

19:07.563 --> 19:09.439
- [knock on door]
- Yes.

19:12.026 --> 19:13.277
Hey.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.328
Mmm-mmm. That's not nearly enough.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.498
[laughing] What?

19:25.581 --> 19:27.166
It's not enough.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.169
I need the rest so I
can make the deposit.

19:30.795 --> 19:33.005
Well, I need to find the guy who has it.

19:34.048 --> 19:37.176
Look... I borrowed from those donations,

19:37.259 --> 19:40.179
at your request, so you
could refurbish your club.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.307
You go and make a gun deal with Domingo.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.560
Then you get jacked and
we're all exposed.

19:45.643 --> 19:48.563
You promised this would be
taken care of, but it's not.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.480
You don't give me orders.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.107
We're partners. You're not my boss.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.528
We're family,
Cornell. But think about it.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.362
Do you really want to go to jail?

19:57.446 --> 19:59.782
- Do you want to lose your club?
- Of course not.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.535
Then you need to fix
this shit right now.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.497
Does your guard dog want
a drink of water?

20:07.582 --> 20:09.750
- [chuckles softly]
- Don't worry about him.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.628
You worry about the
politics, I worry about my job.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.548
Your job is to uncomplicate my life.

20:15.631 --> 20:18.968
And your job is to
turn my water into wine.

20:23.430 --> 20:24.974
Family first, right?

20:26.266 --> 20:27.685
Always.

20:29.144 --> 20:31.438
I'm coming by the club tonight.

20:31.521 --> 20:32.940
[chuckles]

20:33.023 --> 20:35.735
Why? I thought you said you
don't want to be seen there.

20:35.818 --> 20:36.819
I don't.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.196
But I like the music.

20:41.156 --> 20:44.159
I'm going to be on you
until this is resolved.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.663
It's getting resolved.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.414
You best believe that.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.630
[gun cocks]

20:56.338 --> 20:59.508
- You ain't gonna fire that.
- I'll kill you.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.468
Shameek is dead.

21:01.551 --> 21:04.513
They have his half of the
money. Now they want yours.

21:06.849 --> 21:09.518
- Shameek is dead?
- Yeah.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.187
Well, good. [spits]

21:13.355 --> 21:16.025
Then you just want my
money for yourself, don't you?

21:17.610 --> 21:19.361
I couldn't care less.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.822
I came here because Pop
asked me to come for you.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.199
Pops?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.535
For your dad.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.037
[breath trembling]

21:28.120 --> 21:31.206
Why does everybody bring him
up? He was never there for me.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.958
I'm sick and tired of hearing about him.

21:33.876 --> 21:36.045
Pop thinks he has a
way to clear this mess up.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.338
I know you didn't kill Dante...

21:38.839 --> 21:40.007
or Shameek.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.051
All you guys wanted was the cash.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.344
It was an inside job.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.889
Dante's safe idea.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.683
Look...

21:48.766 --> 21:51.811
I found you in four hours for free.

21:52.853 --> 21:56.899
Imagine how fast someone Cottonmouth
pays will find you.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.358
[inhales sharply]

21:58.442 --> 22:02.780
The only chance you have at survival
is if you come with me right now.

22:05.908 --> 22:08.786
Well, I got a half a million
new chances is the way I see it.

22:19.922 --> 22:23.217
Tell Pops... I'm sorry.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.555
He was always good to me.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.850
He deserves better.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.534
Took your rook, rookie.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.329
Hmm.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.042
- It's your move, son.
- [chuckling] Mmm-hmm.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.169
- Don't get scared now.
- Oh, no, no, no...

22:59.253 --> 23:00.838
- [bell chimes]
- [indistinct chatter]

23:08.053 --> 23:09.805
[gate creaking]

23:13.267 --> 23:15.060
[Luke] Want some
catfish with that hot sauce?

23:15.144 --> 23:16.395
[chuckling]

23:17.312 --> 23:20.107
- You count calories, Power Man?
- [sighs]

23:20.190 --> 23:22.442
Fork will kill you quicker
than any bullet.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.155
[chuckling]

23:27.990 --> 23:29.449
I found Chico.

23:31.618 --> 23:33.328
He ain't coming.

23:34.997 --> 23:36.498
You can't save everybody.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.169
You're wrong about that.

23:41.211 --> 23:44.756
What would have happened in my
life if people gave up on me?

23:45.966 --> 23:47.885
I was no angel.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.931
No, I was a beast.

23:52.639 --> 23:55.059
<i>- [man grunting]</i>
- [Pop] <i>I was a beast.</i>

23:55.142 --> 23:56.685
<i>No two ways about it.</i>

23:56.768 --> 23:59.814
[Luke] <i>They call you Pop
because you were the OG?</i>

23:59.897 --> 24:04.651
[Pop] <i>No, it was the sound my fist
made when I knocked a fool out.</i>

24:04.734 --> 24:06.695
<i>Snap, crackle, pop!</i>

24:09.198 --> 24:11.700
<i>Cottonmouth lost three teeth as a kid.</i>

24:11.783 --> 24:15.370
<i>[chuckles] Wilfredo saw him
smile and the name just stuck.</i>

24:16.288 --> 24:20.584
<i>And Fredo was the craziest little
Puerto Rican in black Harlem.</i>

24:20.667 --> 24:24.171
<i>I used to call 'em Thing
One and Thing Two.</i>

24:24.254 --> 24:25.731
Hey, yo, yo, yo. Can I take your photo?

24:25.755 --> 24:28.175
- Yeah, yeah. Jamel, right?
- Right over here, man. Thanks.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.384
Yeah, yeah. [mutters]

24:29.468 --> 24:32.429
[Luke] <i>What'd that make
you? The Cat in the Hat?</i>

24:32.512 --> 24:34.849
<i>- [shutter clicks]</i>
- [Pop] <i>Something like that.</i>

24:38.227 --> 24:40.145
[Luke] So what happened?

24:40.229 --> 24:41.605
[Pop] We got popped.

24:43.107 --> 24:47.277
Wilfredo went from selling
crack to smoking crack.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.698
I got caught with a
gun and a bag of money.

24:51.781 --> 24:53.242
Kept my mouth shut.

24:54.409 --> 24:56.745
Went on pause for ten years.

24:56.828 --> 24:59.081
My woman was pregnant when I went in.

24:59.164 --> 25:01.250
I haven't seen her or...

25:01.333 --> 25:04.419
my son since he was 13.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.047
I have this nightmare that...

25:07.131 --> 25:10.384
one day, he's gonna come to the shop...

25:10.467 --> 25:13.971
ask for a cut, sit in my chair...

25:14.054 --> 25:15.931
and I'm not even gonna know him.

25:18.725 --> 25:21.728
I didn't have one single
skill when I got out.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.857
I could've gone back to the streets.

25:28.443 --> 25:30.195
But you weren't that guy anymore.

25:30.279 --> 25:33.115
I wasn't... and I'm not.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.200
And that's what I go through every day.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.119
Trying not to be that person.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.205
I'm not that guy either.

25:40.289 --> 25:43.417
I thought you was
innocent, Shawshank. Mmm.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.670
I ain't guilty. [sighs]

25:46.753 --> 25:50.007
But... I ain't innocent either.

25:51.300 --> 25:54.803
I had to balance my
dirt... so I opened up this shop.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.599
So those young
knuckleheads have a place to get away.

25:59.683 --> 26:02.686
Like Fredo's son, Chico.

26:02.769 --> 26:09.068
And certain... muscle-headed
fugitives lookin' for a change of pace.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.988
[Pop chuckles]

26:13.072 --> 26:15.115
After what I did at Genghis Connie's...

26:16.575 --> 26:20.870
for the first time in a
long time... I felt at peace.

26:20.955 --> 26:22.206
[Pop] Mmm-hmm.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.749
I made a decision when
I got back to the crib.

26:27.461 --> 26:29.254
I'm done running.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.426
Boys run.

26:35.469 --> 26:37.512
Men stand.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.014
You're a man.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.768
I am who I am.

26:45.270 --> 26:46.688
Or...

26:48.065 --> 26:51.693
maybe I have a chance to find
out who I could really be.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.238
That's right.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.948
- [Luke] Hmm?
- Yeah.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.118
Come on. Let's get going.

27:03.247 --> 27:04.664
Hey, Pop.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.541
Damn. Y'all still at it, huh?

27:06.625 --> 27:08.377
- He don't know when to quit.
- Oh, I know.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.046
[Bobby] Until I win.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.672
Gonna leave it open?

27:12.756 --> 27:14.341
Yeah, till we shut the doors...

27:14.424 --> 27:16.926
[chuckles] whether it's empty or not.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.054
I'm gonna go get my smock.

27:37.281 --> 27:38.615
[grunts]

27:38.698 --> 27:40.867
What... were you thinking?

27:40.950 --> 27:44.621
Sorry. I'm sorry! [sniffles]

27:45.539 --> 27:47.666
[Pop exclaims] You dummy.

27:49.251 --> 27:51.211
- You dummy.
- What's up?

27:51.295 --> 27:52.337
Dummy.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.298
[both sobbing]

28:02.597 --> 28:03.723
You did good.

28:06.017 --> 28:07.227
That's what.

28:09.271 --> 28:11.315
My bad, Mr. Hunter.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.027
Where's the restroom key? Just...

28:16.111 --> 28:17.571
Get out of here.

28:17.654 --> 28:19.239
Go.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.075
You heard me.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.418
You got to get him out of here.

28:33.753 --> 28:36.423
And you know damn well, Chico
ain't gonna show up for work today.

28:36.506 --> 28:39.759
Of course not, but... Pop
will tell us the truth

28:39.843 --> 28:41.761
about who Chico really is.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.472
He's just a barber, right?

28:43.555 --> 28:45.432
Ah, he's a little bit of everything.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.976
Not a very good judge of character.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.604
He's got a big heart. We
should fault him for that?

28:50.687 --> 28:51.980
[Scarfe] Nope.

28:53.607 --> 28:56.151
Gimme a second. And
don't start without me.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.027
Can't do the one-two punch without you.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.281
Turk.

29:04.326 --> 29:05.327
Misty.

29:06.786 --> 29:08.705
I'm surprised to see
you this far uptown.

29:08.788 --> 29:12.000
I'm mostly Midtown nowadays, you know?

29:12.084 --> 29:14.086
Puffy ain't got shit on me, baby.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.755
I'm the real bad boy worldwide.

29:16.838 --> 29:20.175
Yeah, your rap sheet got so many
hits, your record could put out a record.

29:20.925 --> 29:23.928
Hey, I just fell through to see my man,
Bobby Fish, and to play some chess.

29:24.012 --> 29:26.681
Well, you need to fall
your ass back downtown,

29:26.765 --> 29:28.933
'cause if I catch you
around here again...

29:29.017 --> 29:31.603
it's gonna be checkmate.

29:31.686 --> 29:34.189
Understood? Mr. Barrett?

29:34.939 --> 29:36.150
I hear you...

29:37.692 --> 29:39.236
Detective.

29:40.154 --> 29:41.321
Loud and clear.

29:45.992 --> 29:48.370
Did anyone see you come here?

29:48.453 --> 29:51.331
- Hmm?
- No... I don't think so.

29:51.415 --> 29:53.375
- [door opens, bell chimes]
- Luke, check.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.424
[whispers] Five-O!

30:01.508 --> 30:04.010
You need to go in the
bathroom and hide. Go.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.598
Go!

30:10.517 --> 30:12.436
- Hey, Misty.
- Fish.

30:12.519 --> 30:13.937
- How you doin'?
- Good to see you.

30:14.020 --> 30:15.021
You, too.

30:15.104 --> 30:16.791
- [Misty] Is Pop around?
- [Fish] He's in the back.

30:16.815 --> 30:17.941
He'll be out in a minute.

30:19.526 --> 30:22.529
- [pats Pop]
- Let me stall 'em. Sit tight.

30:25.449 --> 30:26.950
[chuckles] Whoa.

30:27.033 --> 30:30.245
Detective Mercedes Knight.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.872
It's Misty now, Pop. You know that.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.583
[Pop] All right, all right.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.959
[chuckles]

30:36.042 --> 30:38.920
Call yourself whatever
you want to, Detective.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.339
- Hey!
- [chuckles] Ooh!

30:40.422 --> 30:42.299
I respect authority.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.301
[both chuckle]

30:44.384 --> 30:46.595
I bet Kelly must be really
proud of you, hmm?

30:46.678 --> 30:50.432
He's still mad I went to Temple instead
of playin' for St. John's.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.601
- Bam!
- Swish!

30:52.684 --> 30:54.102
[both laugh]

30:55.019 --> 30:56.355
Is this your partner?

30:57.314 --> 30:58.940
Detective Rafael Scarfe.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.153
[softly] Okay.

31:04.238 --> 31:06.198
How can I help you?

31:06.281 --> 31:08.908
We're looking for
someone who works for you.

31:08.992 --> 31:10.452
Wilfredo Chico Diaz?

31:10.535 --> 31:13.162
You heard about that shooting...

31:13.247 --> 31:14.831
at the junkyard?

31:14.914 --> 31:16.666
Near the edge of the river?

31:17.751 --> 31:18.877
No.

31:19.461 --> 31:20.712
Really?

31:21.588 --> 31:24.048
There was a shootout.

31:24.758 --> 31:26.760
Looks like a gun deal that was robbed.

31:26.843 --> 31:29.012
Turned into a bloodbath.

31:29.095 --> 31:32.391
Dante Chapman was
found dead at the scene.

31:32.474 --> 31:37.186
Shameek Smith was found about
18 hours later, beaten to death.

31:37.271 --> 31:40.649
Last person to see Shameek Smith alive,

31:40.732 --> 31:42.942
other than a strip club...

31:43.026 --> 31:45.570
was right here at the
shop with his homeboy.

31:47.489 --> 31:48.532
Uh, they were both here.

31:49.949 --> 31:52.952
Chico gave Shameek a fade in that chair,

31:53.036 --> 31:54.871
right next to where you're standing.

31:54.954 --> 31:58.207
That's it though. That's the
last time I saw them both.

31:58.292 --> 32:00.209
You really think Chico
killed his friend?

32:01.711 --> 32:02.962
Over money?

32:04.631 --> 32:05.965
You are?

32:11.263 --> 32:12.556
Luke Cage.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.726
Detective Misty Knight.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.312
Detective.

32:19.313 --> 32:21.940
Looks like you found some
better clothes to audit in.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.280
[exhales]

32:29.614 --> 32:33.159
Look... when my guys are here,

32:33.242 --> 32:34.953
they know the rules.

32:35.036 --> 32:37.664
Respect, no street talk.

32:37.747 --> 32:40.500
But when they leave, I got no control.

32:40.584 --> 32:43.795
Understood, but Chico
is a person of interest

32:43.878 --> 32:46.089
who might have pertinent information.

32:46.172 --> 32:47.591
Pertinent information?

32:47.674 --> 32:50.344
Like, someone
saying who they really are?

32:51.260 --> 32:54.138
Pertinent as in useful.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.807
As in factual.

32:55.890 --> 32:59.268
Like, uh... Chico's
number. You got that, right?

33:00.186 --> 33:02.814
He missed work the last two days.

33:03.940 --> 33:08.987
His booth rent is due, so
maybe he'll return my call.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.781
If you see him, tell him to call me.

33:14.283 --> 33:15.702
Call me anyway.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.955
He may not be safe otherwise.

33:20.289 --> 33:21.750
Will do.

33:23.084 --> 33:25.920
- [chuckles]
- Nice meeting you, Luke.

33:26.004 --> 33:29.341
You too... Detective.

33:40.394 --> 33:42.061
- [door opens]
- [bell chimes]

33:46.608 --> 33:49.277
Really? [scoffs]

33:49.361 --> 33:50.779
We had coffee.

33:50.862 --> 33:54.157
Mmm-hmm. [chuckles] Right.

33:58.327 --> 33:59.663
You gonna call Cottonmouth?

33:59.746 --> 34:01.540
No.

34:01.623 --> 34:04.292
You need to see him.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.085
What?

34:06.169 --> 34:07.421
He's going to want to see you.

34:07.504 --> 34:12.175
No. I'm afraid our... friends in
blue might have eyes on the shop.

34:13.301 --> 34:16.094
You work at Harlem's Paradise.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.139
You have a reason to go there.

34:19.474 --> 34:22.936
You can't do this kind
of thing on the phone.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.399
[sighs]

34:28.942 --> 34:31.319
Look, man, Wilfredo...

34:32.277 --> 34:35.197
he died... on these streets.

34:37.951 --> 34:41.161
I don't wanna see
Chico go out the same way.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.291
Can you do this for me?

34:51.547 --> 34:53.216
I'm on it.

34:53.882 --> 34:54.884
All right.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.556
[softly] Thanks.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.354
[dishes clattering]

35:08.940 --> 35:11.901
[Nate] You're late. I have your money.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.821
Cage.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.865
Cage!

35:16.948 --> 35:18.783
Do you hear me?

35:18.867 --> 35:20.076
Cage!

35:20.159 --> 35:21.661
[indistinct chatter]

35:29.711 --> 35:33.256
Your brother down there told
Candace to send me up a Blue Hawaiian.

35:33.339 --> 35:35.842
Like he gonna get up on
me with a Blue Hawaiian.

35:35.925 --> 35:37.218
[both laugh]

35:38.637 --> 35:40.764
Ah, he lucky I let his ass in here.

35:42.431 --> 35:43.767
I need to speak to your man.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.977
What? You didn't get
tipped at the barber shop?

35:46.060 --> 35:47.311
Pat him down.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.320
He's clean.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.282
Thought you already had a job.

36:00.617 --> 36:02.702
'Cause I could use some more ice.

36:03.870 --> 36:05.288
I'm here for Pop.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.208
Pop is a grown-ass
man. Why ain't he here?

36:10.376 --> 36:13.296
He said you wouldn't wanna
hear this over the phone.

36:13.379 --> 36:14.881
So he sent me.

36:14.964 --> 36:17.466
Ha! The suspense is killing me.

36:17.551 --> 36:20.219
Pop wants to set up a parley for Chico.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.890
He doesn't want him to
end up like Shameek.

36:25.266 --> 36:27.226
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

36:27.769 --> 36:30.146
Those cuts on your hands say different.

36:30.229 --> 36:32.065
[cell phone vibrates and chimes]

36:34.108 --> 36:37.696
All I'm saying is that if you want
to talk to Pop about Chico,

36:37.779 --> 36:39.238
that can be arranged.

36:39.322 --> 36:41.365
All of your goods will be returned.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.620
The only thing our mutual
friend wants is safe passage.

36:46.871 --> 36:50.333
He'll never come back to New York, ever.

36:50.416 --> 36:52.376
I don't speak Chinese.

36:52.460 --> 36:55.922
[laughs] 'Cause that's
what this conversation is to me.

36:56.005 --> 36:59.467
If I got somethin' to say to Pop, I
say it to him my damn self, you dig?

37:02.220 --> 37:04.097
[sighs] There's history.

37:05.514 --> 37:07.141
Pop understands your trouble.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.021
He's just asking you to
remember your history.

37:20.113 --> 37:21.447
[Stokes inhales deeply]

37:25.451 --> 37:28.329
Tell Pop I'll come by the
barbershop for a haircut.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.041
Same time as before.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.501
You understand?

37:35.419 --> 37:36.838
I'll tell him.

37:38.882 --> 37:40.216
By the way...

37:41.550 --> 37:43.052
you're fired.

37:44.553 --> 37:45.847
No, I'm not.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.850
I quit before I walked in.

37:51.853 --> 37:53.354
[chuckles]

37:53.437 --> 37:55.690
- [upbeat music playing]
- [crowd cheering]

38:06.785 --> 38:08.787
We got eyes on the boy.

38:08.870 --> 38:10.454
What do you want me to do?

38:11.289 --> 38:13.541
- Your man say where he was?
- No.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.836
[Stokes] Hmm.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.465
Let it go.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.260
Take care of it in the morning.

38:25.845 --> 38:26.930
You sure?

38:27.013 --> 38:29.307
If he's out on the streets
slippin', handle it.

38:30.224 --> 38:33.352
But if he's not moving
around, I'll deal with it, all right?

38:37.065 --> 38:38.274
[crowd cheering and whistling]

38:38.357 --> 38:41.086
Now let me holler at y'all for a minute.

38:41.110 --> 38:43.612
'Cause I got somethin'
that I need to say.

38:43.697 --> 38:45.239
What y'all know about that thing?

38:45.323 --> 38:47.134
[Mariah] You're wasting
your gifts, my brother.

38:47.158 --> 38:50.494
This gangster life...

38:50.578 --> 38:52.872
not what our ancestors fought for.

38:52.956 --> 38:55.166
Not what our people died for.

38:55.249 --> 38:57.126
This is exactly what they died for.

38:57.836 --> 39:01.630
Self-determination, control, power.

39:29.826 --> 39:33.329
That boy we was looking
for earlier today...

39:33.412 --> 39:35.039
he's at Pop's Barber Shop.

39:36.249 --> 39:38.710
- You seen him?
- With my own two eyes.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.795
How long ago?

39:40.879 --> 39:42.546
A little while back.

39:44.507 --> 39:46.300
Hey!

39:46.384 --> 39:47.385
Hey!

39:48.052 --> 39:50.013
Yo, what's up with my money?

40:01.900 --> 40:03.860
[clippers buzzing]

40:03.943 --> 40:05.111
[Pop] You need to leave?

40:05.194 --> 40:07.155
I'm just gonna pick up
dinner from Boulevard.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.365
Where's Luke?

40:13.119 --> 40:16.956
- Have you seen him?
- Girl, you just don't quit, do you?

40:17.040 --> 40:20.126
- I just want to take him out for coffee.
- [scoffs]

40:29.427 --> 40:32.180
You know what people
remember besides black martyrdom?

40:32.263 --> 40:33.597
What?

40:34.223 --> 40:35.349
Black money.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.938
Don't you ever get sick of
people calling you a criminal?

40:40.021 --> 40:42.065
[gun clicks]

40:42.857 --> 40:45.401
You gonna at least wait for
Chico to come outside, right?

40:46.820 --> 40:48.822
Right?

41:13.304 --> 41:14.848
What he sayin'?

41:14.931 --> 41:18.935
He'll only talk to
you. Right here at the shop.

41:23.272 --> 41:25.859
I want something better.

41:25.942 --> 41:28.527
- Like what?
- Respect.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.614
It's all that ever really matters.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.537
Money outlasts respect.

41:40.081 --> 41:42.250
Respect will put your
name on the side of a building...

41:43.167 --> 41:47.421
but the money that put your name
up there comes from someplace.

41:52.593 --> 41:54.303
At what cost, Cornell?

41:54.387 --> 41:58.224
When you find out... you'll tell me.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.940
[all cheering]

42:13.281 --> 42:15.616
What are you doing out
here with that bag, man?

42:15.699 --> 42:17.785
- There's no TV back there.
- Are you serious?

42:23.332 --> 42:24.333
Pop!

42:35.344 --> 42:36.345
[bullet ricochets]

42:37.180 --> 42:38.222
[screams]

42:48.399 --> 42:50.276
[muffled screaming]

42:51.610 --> 42:53.696
[whispering] Stay dead. Stay dead.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.410
[gunfire stops]

43:09.670 --> 43:11.255
[whimpering]

43:12.298 --> 43:13.466
[gagging]

43:23.351 --> 43:25.269
- You should've waited.
- Shut up, man.

43:39.533 --> 43:41.077
You okay?

43:41.995 --> 43:44.330
Pop! [softly] Pop.

43:44.413 --> 43:46.540
Oh, Pop... [crying]

43:46.624 --> 43:48.209
[gagging]

43:48.292 --> 43:49.335
- Come on...
- [Pop grunts]

43:49.418 --> 43:51.545
- [wheezing]
- You hear the sirens?

43:52.546 --> 43:55.549
[panting] They're
almost here. They comin'.

43:57.093 --> 43:58.927
Someone call the goddamn ambulance!

44:00.221 --> 44:01.680
[Luke sobbing]

44:03.391 --> 44:04.600
[Pop straining] Swear...

44:06.227 --> 44:08.980
Swear jar...

44:09.605 --> 44:12.233
[crying] I will. I will.

44:14.693 --> 44:15.944
[gulps]

44:16.029 --> 44:17.738
Luke...

44:21.200 --> 44:24.703
[stuttering] Forward... always.

44:24.787 --> 44:26.205
[gagging]

44:28.874 --> 44:30.334
Always...

44:32.253 --> 44:35.506
[stuttering] forward.

44:39.718 --> 44:41.054
[whispers] Always forward.

44:42.263 --> 44:43.264
[mumbling]

44:45.183 --> 44:46.600
[crying] No.

44:48.269 --> 44:50.146
[sniffling] No...

44:51.064 --> 44:53.191
No! [sobbing]

44:55.068 --> 44:56.277
No!

44:57.986 --> 44:59.655
[screaming] No!

45:02.825 --> 45:05.536
[breathing heavily]

45:06.662 --> 45:08.122
[sniffles]

45:19.508 --> 45:21.844
[indistinct radio chatter]

45:21.927 --> 45:23.971
[Lonnie] Mommy, I'm okay.

45:24.054 --> 45:26.974
I'm okay. Luke covered me.

45:27.057 --> 45:29.893
He said he didn't move because he
didn't want them to shoot again.

45:29.977 --> 45:32.980
- [Patty sighs] You see who did this?
- [Lonnie] No, Mama.

45:33.063 --> 45:35.024
[officer] Excuse me, ma'am.
Will you come with me?

45:38.736 --> 45:40.613
[Scarfe] You get a look at the shooter?

45:40.696 --> 45:41.864
Nah.

45:41.947 --> 45:43.991
It's a miracle I'm even alive, man.

45:56.670 --> 45:58.214
Luke.

45:59.882 --> 46:01.259
Luke?

46:02.176 --> 46:03.594
Are you okay?

46:08.807 --> 46:10.268
You didn't get hit?

46:11.519 --> 46:13.354
I said I'm okay.

46:17.691 --> 46:19.152
What happened?

46:20.110 --> 46:21.695
They started firing.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.823
The kid, Lonnie, was in
the middle of the room.

46:25.741 --> 46:27.993
So, once I saw the flash...

46:28.911 --> 46:30.704
instincts kicked in.

46:31.789 --> 46:34.833
I grabbed him... and I shielded him.

46:36.001 --> 46:39.672
You... shielded him? You
shielded him with what?

46:43.634 --> 46:45.678
Have the paramedics seen you yet?

46:47.095 --> 46:49.890
I said I'm good.

46:53.644 --> 46:56.230
How long have you been working
here at the shop?

46:56.314 --> 46:57.981
Five months.

46:59.858 --> 47:05.364
Did Chico reach out to Pop since
we were in here earlier?

47:07.366 --> 47:09.868
Was he hiding out here the whole time?

47:15.291 --> 47:19.086
- What did they get from the canvass?
- [Scarfe] Uh, patrol got nothing.

47:19.169 --> 47:22.047
Traffic cam picked up a black Escalade.

47:22.172 --> 47:25.801
Tracked it to Hunts Point in the
Bronx, but it was torched. No prints.

47:25.884 --> 47:28.095
[inhales sharply] They were after Chico?

47:28.178 --> 47:30.514
- There's no doubt in my mind.
- Hmm.

47:30.598 --> 47:33.767
I checked out Cottonmouth. He's
been at the club all night in VIP.

47:34.685 --> 47:37.104
- So we don't have shit?
- No.

47:37.187 --> 47:40.774
No decent witnesses except
for Chico, but then what else?

47:40.858 --> 47:42.067
Nothin'?

48:00.210 --> 48:02.045
[indistinct chatter]

48:05.424 --> 48:07.134
[man] Yeah, baby. Uh-huh.

48:18.437 --> 48:20.606
- [mouthing] Upstairs.
- I'm coming with you.

48:20.689 --> 48:22.858
- Nah.
- No, I need to be there.

48:26.236 --> 48:27.905
[Stokes] What's wrong, Shades?

48:29.698 --> 48:32.034
- You should've waited.
- Waited? [scoffs]

48:32.117 --> 48:35.371
Bump that noise. I got
the call. It was me.

48:35.454 --> 48:36.914
What happened?

48:36.997 --> 48:38.666
Look, Turk calls me.

48:38.749 --> 48:41.960
Tells me he saw Chic
at the shop, slippin'.

48:42.044 --> 48:45.631
I came and ask you if it was
important if the nigga was breathing.

48:45.714 --> 48:47.090
You seem non-committal...

48:48.509 --> 48:49.885
so I make an executive decision.

48:50.969 --> 48:52.430
[both laughing]

48:52.513 --> 48:55.015
That's what you call...
an executive decision?

48:55.098 --> 48:56.434
[chuckles]

48:56.517 --> 48:57.893
Yeah, okay.

48:59.102 --> 49:01.063
Mmm, so you caught him slippin' outside?

49:01.146 --> 49:03.941
No, bro, I lit that shit
up like the Fourth of July.

49:04.024 --> 49:07.611
<i>[chuckling] It was all so Django
Candyland shit for real.</i>

49:07.695 --> 49:09.738
Lights, camera, action,
baby! [clapping hands]

49:09.822 --> 49:11.990
Somebody call Quentin! [laughing]

49:16.745 --> 49:19.582
I suggested... we wait.

49:19.665 --> 49:21.291
[Tone] Wait?

49:21.375 --> 49:24.462
[stammers] Wait for what, Shades?

49:25.546 --> 49:28.131
You ain't even down with the
clique. You can't give orders.

49:28.882 --> 49:30.968
It was loud 'cause it's supposed to be.

49:31.051 --> 49:34.262
Niggas need to know you
don't rob Cottonmouth!

49:34.347 --> 49:36.557
[yelling] My name is not Cottonmouth!

49:40.811 --> 49:42.187
[Tone] My bad.

49:42.270 --> 49:43.814
My bad.

49:44.523 --> 49:46.191
He's dead, right?

49:46.274 --> 49:49.194
Chico's laid out... He's done.

49:49.277 --> 49:51.489
It don't matter. We got the money!

49:55.075 --> 49:56.660
[breathes deeply]

49:56.744 --> 49:58.496
You had to do it, I guess.

50:05.002 --> 50:06.712
Pops can rebuild. [inhales sharply]

50:08.464 --> 50:10.508
He won't like it but
I'll donate some money...

50:11.717 --> 50:13.176
anonymously.

50:13.260 --> 50:15.356
It's all gonna be okay.
[chuckles softly]

50:15.381 --> 50:16.536
[pats arm]

50:21.852 --> 50:23.228
What?

50:25.773 --> 50:26.899
Pops is dead.

50:30.653 --> 50:32.946
A casualty of war.

50:33.030 --> 50:35.198
You know... [stammers] Shit happens.

50:35.282 --> 50:36.659
[Turk] Yo...

50:36.742 --> 50:38.411
Where's my money?

50:41.121 --> 50:42.623
How the hell did you get up here?

50:42.706 --> 50:44.792
I'm Turk Barrett, baby.

50:44.875 --> 50:47.294
The door ain't been built
yet that can hold me back.

50:47.377 --> 50:49.254
Now, where's my money?

50:50.631 --> 50:52.090
Okay, Mr. Barrett.

50:52.174 --> 50:55.135
Tone promised to pay you
for finding Chico, right?

50:55.218 --> 50:57.304
- Yeah.
- That right?

51:00.599 --> 51:02.100
Okay.

51:02.976 --> 51:04.311
Hey, hey, hey!

51:04.394 --> 51:06.146
[screaming]

51:09.858 --> 51:11.819
[panting]

51:14.237 --> 51:19.493
You can collect your money from
Tone downstairs, Mr. Barrett!

51:22.621 --> 51:25.791
I assume that completes our business.

51:27.125 --> 51:29.211
Y'all Harlem niggas are off the hook.

51:29.294 --> 51:31.922
I'm going back to Hell's
Kitchen, where it's safe.

51:32.005 --> 51:33.423
[scoffs]

51:41.640 --> 51:43.016
Is that sufficient?

51:46.770 --> 51:48.438
There's enough there.

51:53.026 --> 51:54.903
You all right, cuz?

51:54.987 --> 51:56.697
With what?

51:58.532 --> 52:01.243
Extortion? Well...

52:02.244 --> 52:04.454
Murder, no!

52:04.538 --> 52:06.081
I'm not good.

52:08.041 --> 52:09.502
Don't expect me to be.

52:09.585 --> 52:11.587
The money's still green.

52:15.257 --> 52:16.800
That it is.

52:18.218 --> 52:19.803
You should get outta here.

52:20.846 --> 52:24.016
You shouldn't be seen
associating with known criminals...

52:24.099 --> 52:25.726
Councilwoman.

52:25.809 --> 52:27.269
Take the side exit.

52:27.352 --> 52:29.813
I got some garbage to
clean up downstairs.

52:39.573 --> 52:41.324
Sorry about Pop.

52:43.827 --> 52:45.663
Yeah, so am I.

52:45.746 --> 52:47.205
I know what he meant to you.

52:48.165 --> 52:49.374
[Stokes sighs deeply]

52:51.710 --> 52:55.589
Believe it or not, there's
supposed to be rules to this shit.

53:17.110 --> 53:19.112
He must have gotten hit.

53:22.282 --> 53:23.617
What?

53:25.744 --> 53:27.663
Luke...

53:27.746 --> 53:29.081
Cage.

53:31.124 --> 53:32.793
He shielded the kid.

53:34.587 --> 53:37.756
He had bullet holes in his shirt.

53:37.840 --> 53:40.300
Blood everywhere, none of it his?

53:42.469 --> 53:44.304
How did he not get hit?

53:46.556 --> 53:48.100
You're drunk.

53:51.394 --> 53:52.980
Not yet.

54:51.664 --> 54:55.083
- [breathing deeply]
- [man] What are you doing here, nigga?

55:03.508 --> 55:05.135
I'm not gonna ask you again.

55:08.263 --> 55:09.807
Young man...

55:10.974 --> 55:13.185
I've had a long day.

55:14.561 --> 55:16.521
I'm tired.

55:16.604 --> 55:18.648
But I'm not tired enough...

55:18.732 --> 55:21.735
to ever let nobody call me that word.

55:24.404 --> 55:26.573
You see a nigga
standin' in front of you?

55:27.866 --> 55:31.619
Across the street from a building named
after one of our greatest heroes?

55:32.537 --> 55:35.457
- [gun cocks]
- Yeah, a dead one.

55:35.540 --> 55:36.875
[Luke sighs]

55:38.126 --> 55:40.337
You even know who Crispus Attucks was?

55:41.588 --> 55:43.090
A free black man.

55:43.173 --> 55:46.885
The first man to die for
what became America.

55:48.762 --> 55:52.515
He could've acted scared when
those Brits raised their guns.

55:52.599 --> 55:54.642
Blended in, in the crowd.

55:54.727 --> 55:56.269
But he stepped up!

55:57.187 --> 55:58.897
He paid with his life.

55:59.647 --> 56:01.399
But he started something.

56:02.484 --> 56:04.527
That's what Pop did...

56:04.611 --> 56:05.695
Not me.

56:06.363 --> 56:09.366
I laid in the cut until he stepped up!

56:10.242 --> 56:12.035
And it cost him his life, too.

56:13.912 --> 56:16.414
I ain't laying back no more!

56:17.207 --> 56:18.375
You wanna shoot me?

56:19.417 --> 56:21.128
Do it.

56:21.211 --> 56:22.712
Pull the trigger, nigga!

56:22.796 --> 56:25.507
I ain't got all night.
[breathing heavily]

56:25.590 --> 56:27.009
Do it!

56:27.885 --> 56:30.678
What, you scared?

56:30.763 --> 56:32.973
[breathing heavily] Fine.

56:33.974 --> 56:35.517
I'll do it for you.

57:11.011 --> 57:12.930
Always forward, Pop.

57:14.722 --> 57:16.183
Forward...

57:17.434 --> 57:18.936
always.

57:22.397 --> 57:24.399
