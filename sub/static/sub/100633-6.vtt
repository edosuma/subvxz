WEBVTT

00:22.022 --> 00:24.291
[Harley] Okay.
Marry, fuck, kill.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.326
Kite Man,
Mr. Freeze, Joker.

00:26.393 --> 00:28.829
Yeah, I mean, the first one
is my fiancee, so, duh.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.731
And then,
the other two are dead,

00:30.797 --> 00:33.500
and one of them is
your dead ex-boyfriend.
So, gross and duh.

00:33.567 --> 00:36.804
All right, last one.
Two-Face, Killer Croc,
Joker.

00:36.871 --> 00:39.139
Again, he's dead,
so let's just--

00:39.206 --> 00:40.606
No. No, it's Joker.

00:40.673 --> 00:42.843
Holy shit.
It's... [gasps]

00:42.909 --> 00:45.445
A totally
unremarkable looking
white guy.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.715
Ive, I am telling you
that is him,

00:47.780 --> 00:50.317
just without
his puke green hair
and bleached white skin.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.552
And maniacal laugh,
blood lust in his eyes,

00:52.618 --> 00:54.112
and fire engine red lips?

00:54.112 --> 00:55.621
No, that was lipstick.
He always stole mine.

00:55.689 --> 00:56.856
Ugh! He was so annoying.

00:56.923 --> 00:58.423
Like, hello, you can
murder a family,

00:58.423 --> 00:59.826
but you're afraid to buy
makeup on your own? [scoffs]

00:59.893 --> 01:01.728
Harls, this guy
does not look like

01:01.728 --> 01:03.831
he was flattened
by a thousand tons
of steel and concrete

01:03.898 --> 01:06.299
when a tower of his own image
crushed him to death,

01:06.299 --> 01:07.834
which is what happened
to Joker, so...

01:07.834 --> 01:09.703
Uh, his body was never found.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.805
Haven't you seen
those conspiracy videos
on WayneTube?

01:11.805 --> 01:13.840
Yeah, the one with the song
raises some decent points.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.343
But still, it's impossible
that that guy is him.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.346
Joker tried to throw me
in that acid to undo me.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.480
What if that's him undone?

01:20.480 --> 01:22.314
Yeah, I think you're done.

01:22.314 --> 01:23.584
Babe, I'm telling you
it's not him.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.433
Oh, fuck, it's him!

01:30.222 --> 01:32.259
[theme music playing]

01:34.000 --> 01:35.796
-Do you think he saw us?
-Oh, I hope he saw us,

01:35.796 --> 01:37.531
because I want him to see
the face of his murderer.

01:37.597 --> 01:39.299
-[Harley grunts]
-Hey!

01:39.299 --> 01:41.701
Ivy, no! I just wanna leave
without causing a scene,

01:41.769 --> 01:43.469
for the first time
in my life.

01:45.272 --> 01:46.472
Whoa!

01:47.875 --> 01:49.742
I'm so sorry.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.578
Oh. Totally my fault.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.647
It's not often
we have bar patrons
on the floor.

01:53.713 --> 01:56.149
I should not
have been daydreaming.

01:56.215 --> 01:57.885
Uh, about world domination?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.418
Skintight purple suits?

01:59.486 --> 02:01.587
Heavens, no!
Purple clothes?

02:01.587 --> 02:03.489
I wish I was that bold.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.459
No, I was just thinking
about my kids.

02:06.525 --> 02:08.000
-Kids?
-Say what?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.796
Well, you know, they're
my girlfriend's kids
technically,

02:09.862 --> 02:11.330
but they feel like
they're my kids.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.165
Here. Here's a picture.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.536
-Harley.
-You, you know who I am?

02:16.603 --> 02:19.338
No. Just, it says "Harley"
on your bat here.

02:19.406 --> 02:20.841
-You almost left it.
-Thanks.

02:20.907 --> 02:23.811
Well, if you need
extra napkins or water,

02:23.877 --> 02:25.846
you know where to find me.
[chuckles] Bye.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.814
Joker always told me
he hated kids.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.282
You bought
that whole act?

02:29.348 --> 02:30.683
He is fucking with you.

02:30.751 --> 02:31.951
I don't know
what his game is,

02:31.951 --> 02:33.385
but seriously,
we should just kill him.

02:33.453 --> 02:35.756
[humming nonchalantly]

02:35.823 --> 02:37.556
Yeah, I'm killing him.

02:37.623 --> 02:39.292
We can't kill a normie.

02:39.359 --> 02:41.527
Maybe that acid changed him,
you know, for reals.

02:41.527 --> 02:42.795
Last time you thought
he changed,

02:42.795 --> 02:44.456
he pushed you out
of a helicopter.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.834
This is totally different.
We are not in a helicopter.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.568
-People can't change.
-I did.

02:48.568 --> 02:50.003
Remember when I used
to be a psychologist,

02:50.003 --> 02:51.872
and I wore my hair up
all the time?

02:51.938 --> 02:53.674
Even then I could tell
deep down you were
a crazy bitch.

02:53.740 --> 02:54.942
Aw. Thanks.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.242
You are who you are
at your core,

02:57.310 --> 02:59.312
now and forever.

02:59.312 --> 03:01.900
You're wrong,
and I can prove it.

03:10.389 --> 03:11.557
[rock music blaring]

03:11.625 --> 03:13.560
Ninety-nine, one hundred.
Damn it.

03:13.627 --> 03:14.927
Better luck next time, boy-o.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.429
Two out of three, squats.

03:16.496 --> 03:17.563
You're on!

03:17.631 --> 03:19.566
[both grunting]

03:21.534 --> 03:23.971
[Harleen clears throat]

03:24.038 --> 03:25.872
Well, you must be
Dr. Quinzel.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.240
Pleasure to meet you. I'm--

03:27.306 --> 03:28.943
Harvey Dent, of course.

03:29.008 --> 03:30.978
You're only the best
district attorney
Gotham's ever had.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.513
And let's keep it that way
at the polls tomorrow.

03:33.580 --> 03:34.895
Can I count on your vote?

03:34.895 --> 03:36.650
It's important
young people like you vote.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.985
Well, I may be young,
but you did call me in

03:39.052 --> 03:40.567
to be the Joker's
psychologist

03:40.567 --> 03:43.323
because, you know,
I studied his pathology
more than anyone else.

03:43.323 --> 03:44.858
Wrote my entire
thesis paper on him,

03:44.925 --> 03:47.259
but, hey, you know that.

03:47.259 --> 03:49.862
We never read your paper.
Hell, we didn't even know
you wrote one.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.598
Oh, then... Then why
did you hire me?

03:51.598 --> 03:53.400
Because you're cheap
and you've got a pulse, skirt.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.901
Joker's chewed up
every other shrink in Gotham.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.537
Which is why this election
is so important.

03:57.604 --> 03:59.605
Take an extra for your mom.
She'll love it.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.608
I believe in you.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.010
I won't let you down, sir.
I'm sure in no time, I can--

04:04.078 --> 04:05.878
We have no time.

04:05.878 --> 04:08.048
That psychopath's
planted a bomb
somewhere in the city.

04:08.115 --> 04:10.449
We need you to find out where
before it goes kaboom!

04:10.516 --> 04:12.686
We've only got 24 hours
before the polls close.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.147
Or the bomb goes off.

04:14.147 --> 04:15.923
What did I say, the polls?
No, the bomb. The bomb.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.557
Yes. No, I'm talking
about the bomb.

04:17.557 --> 04:18.725
Of course, I'm thinking
about the bomb.

04:18.725 --> 04:19.725
-[alarm blaring]
-Damn it!

04:23.096 --> 04:24.096
[gasps]

04:26.065 --> 04:28.615
[guard screaming]

04:32.805 --> 04:34.341
What happened?
Why does it look like

04:34.406 --> 04:36.343
a salad bar exploded?

04:36.408 --> 04:41.408
Sir, the cafeteria
accidentally ordered
living lettuce, sir.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.386
[grunting]

04:48.055 --> 04:49.857
[wincing]

04:50.757 --> 04:51.858
[gunshot]

04:51.925 --> 04:52.925
[moans]

04:56.629 --> 04:59.480
[breathing heavily]

05:03.103 --> 05:05.437
Mr. Dent, you can't
burn inmates.

05:05.504 --> 05:07.107
Not yet. But prop 17

05:07.173 --> 05:09.877
gives an exciting,
new definition
to prisoners' rights.

05:09.942 --> 05:11.156
What are you gawking at?

05:11.156 --> 05:12.846
Get to the Joker
and find that bomb.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.781
Remember,
tomorrow at the polls,

05:14.848 --> 05:16.348
yes on 17!

05:26.660 --> 05:27.793
[glass squeaks]

05:31.497 --> 05:32.598
[Riddler] Riddle me this.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.000
Who's in over her head

05:34.067 --> 05:36.403
and should've majored
in communication?

05:36.468 --> 05:38.504
Joke's on you.
That was my minor.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.939
Joke was on me. [gasps]

05:42.108 --> 05:43.509
[Harleen] I'm so sorry.

05:43.576 --> 05:45.079
They shouldn't have done that.

05:45.144 --> 05:48.894
-Fuck off, narc.
-[spits]

05:53.754 --> 05:54.853
You ready, sugar?

05:57.057 --> 05:59.307
[siren blaring]

06:13.505 --> 06:16.675
[laughing]
Hello, puddin'.

06:16.742 --> 06:17.911
-[Harleen] Puddin'?
-Oh, shit.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.579
I thought
you brought my lunch.

06:19.646 --> 06:21.581
Who's hungry for pudding?

06:21.581 --> 06:23.951
Joker, you're gonna
eat the dessert first?

06:24.016 --> 06:26.552
Ah ha! You know it, pal.

06:28.654 --> 06:29.923
[sighs]

06:29.990 --> 06:32.125
Word to the wise,
Dr. Quinzel,

06:32.192 --> 06:35.028
never end up
in maximum security,

06:35.095 --> 06:36.862
no matter how fun
the crime is.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.764
Eating alone
is a real drag.

06:38.831 --> 06:40.500
So, you know who I am?

06:40.500 --> 06:43.937
I read your thesis.
I thought it was pretty good.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.139
Oh.

06:45.206 --> 06:46.773
For fan fic.

06:46.839 --> 06:48.875
Darling, if you want
to get the story right,

06:48.875 --> 06:50.211
you have to go
straight to the source.

06:50.211 --> 06:51.745
That's why I'm here.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.012
An opportunity to set
the record straight.

06:53.012 --> 06:55.983
[laughing]
Well, that's very good.

06:56.050 --> 06:58.752
But you're here
because you want me
to dish about the bomb,

06:58.752 --> 07:02.788
which is gonna go kaboom
in two freckles past a hair.

07:02.855 --> 07:04.124
Ooh, that's soon.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.591
Okay, you caught me.

07:05.658 --> 07:07.293
So, if you're not
gonna tell me where,

07:07.293 --> 07:08.829
maybe you'd like
to tell me why?

07:08.896 --> 07:10.963
What? Look at this!

07:11.031 --> 07:13.000
It's, like, five peas.

07:13.067 --> 07:15.569
Seriously, what kind
of nutrients

07:15.634 --> 07:17.737
am I going to get
from five peas?

07:17.737 --> 07:19.305
How about we take a step back
and talk about

07:19.305 --> 07:20.882
your obsession with the bat?

07:20.882 --> 07:23.009
What's that? I'm sorry.
The speakers are getting
a little fuzzy.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.677
[mimics crackling]

07:24.745 --> 07:27.547
Where's Dr. Quinn's...
[mimics crackling]

07:27.613 --> 07:31.117
Peas... [mimics crackling]
Puddin'?

07:31.185 --> 07:33.153
Let me in the cell.
I need to get on his level.

07:33.220 --> 07:35.021
That's tough to do
with bars between us.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.891
-You mean the glass?
-Whatever, Cheryl.
Just do it.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.658
Your funeral, sug.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.865
There, the speakers
aren't a problem anymore.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.968
It's just you and me,

07:49.036 --> 07:51.137
with nothing
in between us.

07:53.572 --> 07:54.807
What? Hey!

07:54.875 --> 07:57.278
What do we have here?
Let me see.

07:57.343 --> 08:00.012
Mighty fine
penmanship. Hmm.

08:00.079 --> 08:02.548
Blah, blah, blah. "Insane."

08:02.615 --> 08:04.884
Oh, yes. Blah, blah, blah.
"Egomaniac."

08:04.951 --> 08:06.752
Blah, blah. "Cute."

08:06.819 --> 08:09.723
-I would never write that.
-But I know you thought it.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.990
[Joker laughing]

08:11.057 --> 08:12.826
People are afraid of you,
but I'm not.

08:12.892 --> 08:15.728
Somewhere inside that big clown
is a human being.

08:15.795 --> 08:17.997
-One that can be helped.
-You're so right.

08:18.064 --> 08:19.833
People are scared of me.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.735
[yells]

08:21.802 --> 08:23.637
And for good reason.

08:24.904 --> 08:26.538
No.

08:26.605 --> 08:28.774
Just to be clear
about the bomb,

08:28.774 --> 08:31.110
I'm not telling you shit.
[laughing]

08:31.177 --> 08:33.647
Do not touch me.

08:34.681 --> 08:35.881
Hey!

08:35.948 --> 08:36.984
[both] Ah!

08:37.049 --> 08:39.753
[chuckles]
You've got spunk.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.188
I hate spunk.

08:42.255 --> 08:43.789
[Harley grunts]

08:45.057 --> 08:48.294
An athlete
and a scholar.
[laughs]

08:48.361 --> 08:50.697
You're far too good
for this dump.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.099
[Joker grunts]

08:53.100 --> 08:55.101
Ah, well, I win.

08:57.136 --> 08:58.136
[grunts]

08:58.172 --> 08:59.306
[exhales deeply]

08:59.373 --> 09:02.808
Come back
anytime, Harley.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.110
[Joker laughing]

09:06.779 --> 09:08.648
[exhales heavily]

09:10.082 --> 09:13.052
Any idea
how stupid that was?

09:13.120 --> 09:14.855
It's a miracle
he didn't kill you.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.755
But he didn't.
Joker wasn't trying
to kill me,

09:16.822 --> 09:18.024
he was testing me.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.860
He's screwing
with you, Quinzel.

09:19.926 --> 09:21.227
Oh, what's the u--

09:21.294 --> 09:23.096
You're done. Turn in
your badge and gun.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.865
I don't have those things.

09:24.931 --> 09:27.933
Ah, right. Well, turn in
your clipboard and glasses.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.003
I know I can get
through to him.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.638
Give me one more chance.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.005
-Well, what other option
do we have?
-Me.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.941
Jesus! Was he here
the whole time?

09:35.008 --> 09:36.342
I'll make Joker talk.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.678
[grunts]

09:42.948 --> 09:44.250
Where's the bomb?

09:44.317 --> 09:46.019
[Joker] Why don't
you ask Robin?

09:46.086 --> 09:49.089
Oh, wait. Jason Todd
is dead, that's right,

09:49.155 --> 09:52.326
because I killed him.
[laughing maniacally]

09:52.393 --> 09:54.360
[grunts] Too soon?

09:54.427 --> 09:56.028
[laughing]

09:59.066 --> 10:02.066
[continues laughing]

10:06.773 --> 10:08.308
[punches landing]

10:08.375 --> 10:10.311
-Licorice?
-Oh, I could go
for a red snack.

10:10.376 --> 10:12.044
Oh, last one.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.881
[Joker laughing]

10:15.948 --> 10:18.717
Leaving so soon, Batsy?

10:18.784 --> 10:21.788
We were just revving up.
[laughing]

10:22.423 --> 10:24.325
He's a lost cause.

10:24.325 --> 10:26.192
We need to evacuate
the city while there's
still time.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.428
No, we can't panic
the voters.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.197
Uh, the citizens.

10:30.264 --> 10:35.264
You still think
you can get to him?

10:37.937 --> 10:40.874
You bet I can.
Just give me a minute.

10:40.941 --> 10:43.177
So, got any plans
for tonight, Batman?

10:43.243 --> 10:45.446
Uh, stop Joker
from blowing up Gotham.

10:45.446 --> 10:47.246
Yeah, of course.

10:48.748 --> 10:49.883
I meant, like, after that.

10:51.149 --> 10:52.318
I want to ask you
about Joker.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.453
Just kill him already.

10:53.520 --> 10:54.754
But then the bomb will go off.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.056
People aren't worth saving.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.325
Kill joker, kill people,
kill yourself.

10:58.392 --> 11:00.961
Your file says
you were in group therapy
with Joker,

11:01.028 --> 11:03.129
but all the notes
are missing.
What happened?

11:03.197 --> 11:05.432
Tough to take notes
when you're getting murdered.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.201
Joker killed the psychologist?

11:07.201 --> 11:09.836
Yeah, he really didn't
want to talk about his family.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.004
-Hmm.
-And you know what?
I don't wanna talk to you,

11:12.004 --> 11:14.205
-so get out!
-Thanks for the help.

11:25.918 --> 11:28.200
Back for more, Harley?

11:29.423 --> 11:31.158
It's Dr. Quinzel.

11:31.225 --> 11:33.793
Well, Doc,
you've got guts.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.929
I'll give you that.
But that's all you get.

11:36.996 --> 11:38.831
I don't wanna hear
about the bomb.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.100
I wanna hear about
what makes you tick.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.903
[laughs] That's good.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.203
And it's almost a joke.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.065
Tell me about growing up.

11:46.065 --> 11:49.109
[Joker] <i>Oh, look</i>
<i>who passed their freshman</i>
<i>psychology class.</i>

11:49.176 --> 11:51.378
<i>We're in an insane asylum.</i>

11:51.445 --> 11:54.080
<i>Not a single person in here</i>
<i>came from a happy home.</i>

11:54.081 --> 11:57.317
People around here
seem to think you have
real daddy issues.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.818
[laughs] Ha!
Who told you that?

11:59.885 --> 12:01.288
Was it Penguin?

12:01.288 --> 12:04.457
That mutant orphan's the one
with daddy issues.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.960
Well, I can see this is
just too painful for you.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.794
-We can stop for today.
-Painful?

12:08.861 --> 12:11.130
You think you can
hurt me, sweetheart?

12:11.197 --> 12:13.399
I've been hurt by the best.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.902
Oh, please. Everyone's
scarred by their childhood.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.105
Not worse than me!

12:19.873 --> 12:24.244
Fine. You wanna know
how I got
these emotional scars?

12:24.311 --> 12:26.410
I'm listening.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.350
All right.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.821
I'll admit my parents
weren't too fond of me.

12:34.821 --> 12:35.922
What makes you think that?

12:35.989 --> 12:38.100
Let me see.
Quote.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.894
"Son, we're not
fond of you."

12:40.961 --> 12:43.897
My parents were wealthy,
but they never gave me much,

12:43.964 --> 12:45.899
especially not their attention.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.302
So, you must have spent
a lot of time alone.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.136
Well, I had Mr. Ferris.

12:50.202 --> 12:51.538
Was he a role model for you?

12:51.605 --> 12:54.307
He was a ferret,
a beautiful beast.

12:54.374 --> 12:58.544
With gorgeous ringed fur,
Mr. Ferris, the ferret.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.913
Being an only neglected child,

13:00.980 --> 13:02.381
the pet was a brother to me.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.216
We were inseparable.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.086
Until one night,
while Mummy was away,

13:07.153 --> 13:09.889
<i>I made the mistake</i>
<i>of wandering into</i>
<i>my father's study.</i>

13:09.956 --> 13:13.994
<i>There I found dear, old Dad</i>
<i>with our maid, naked.</i>

13:14.059 --> 13:17.364
<i>He roared at me,</i>
<i>so I rushed out,</i>
<i>went straight to bed.</i>

13:17.431 --> 13:19.198
<i>I hadn't even had supper.</i>

13:19.265 --> 13:21.835
<i>After all,</i>
<i>the maid was busy.</i>

13:21.902 --> 13:24.870
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>I found Ferris's cage empty,</i>

13:24.937 --> 13:27.908
<i>and Daddy above it</i>
<i>with the widest smile</i>
<i>I'd ever seen.</i>

13:27.974 --> 13:29.442
<i>That day,</i>
<i>my father took away</i>

13:29.509 --> 13:31.477
the one thing
I'd ever loved.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.447
Then he beat
the shit out of me.

13:33.447 --> 13:35.548
I just remember him
standing over me,
punching and laughing,

13:35.615 --> 13:37.884
laughing and punching,
and punching.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.187
[laughing maniacally]

13:41.120 --> 13:42.471
[sobbing]

13:46.427 --> 13:49.629
Personally, I never got
what was so funny.

13:49.697 --> 13:52.198
But that's the thing
about comedy.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.500
Not everyone gets the joke.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.537
You're not defined
by your father.

13:56.604 --> 13:58.971
You don't have to
destroy the world.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.140
I can help you
if you help me.

14:01.207 --> 14:04.211
All right. I'll 'fess up
about the bomb.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.912
-But promise me one thing.
-Of course.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.381
I want to eat a normal meal
like a normal person

14:08.448 --> 14:12.620
in a normal insane asylum
at the cafeteria and all.

14:12.620 --> 14:14.554
Done. Next week, you can eat
whatever you want.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.457
No, no. No, it has
to be tonight,

14:17.524 --> 14:21.227
because I don't trust
those assholes to keep
your word.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.096
-Licorice, Batman?
-You said you were out.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.498
-I found more.
-Shut it.

14:24.565 --> 14:26.032
<i>Tell me where the bomb is,</i>

14:26.032 --> 14:27.331
<i>and you'll have</i>
<i>that meal tonight.</i>

14:29.636 --> 14:30.937
I promise.

14:34.006 --> 14:36.476
I believe you.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.980
The bomb is in the heart
of Little Italy.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.581
Holy hell! She did it!

14:41.649 --> 14:43.261
Yeah, that's beginners' luck.

14:43.261 --> 14:45.519
That's the last time
I'll underestimate a skirt
with a PhD.

14:45.586 --> 14:47.287
I'm gonna win the election.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.221
Men in prison,
get everyone over
to Little Italy.

14:49.288 --> 14:50.990
-Pronto!
-That's Italian.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.626
We can carpool, right?
Global warming, it's an issue.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.461
I, of course, can't go.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.998
Me around an armed bomb?
Bad photo op.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.433
But do anything it takes
to stop that bomb.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.970
The voters thank you.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.172
You still alive?

15:05.238 --> 15:06.539
Guess I owe Riddler a 20.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.307
Joker 'fessed up,
thanks to you.

15:08.307 --> 15:10.476
-I didn't do anything.
-You told me about his family.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.679
That was nothing.
And I wouldn't have even
told you about it

15:12.679 --> 15:14.246
if I knew you were gonna be
so smug about it.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.948
Like it or not,
you helped me.

15:16.015 --> 15:18.284
Everyone needs a friend.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.288
And since you want humans
wiped from the face
of the earth...

15:21.355 --> 15:23.590
Right. So, you cut
a plant for me?

15:23.657 --> 15:28.657
-I could kill you with this.
-Yeah, you could.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.365
You know,
if I dip my shoulder,

15:46.365 --> 15:48.315
I could just squeeze right into
that little space up front.

15:48.315 --> 15:51.116
-No.
-No? Yeah, dumb idea.
Dumb.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.970
[chuckling]

16:01.293 --> 16:02.793
[laughing]

16:08.501 --> 16:09.736
Yoo-hoo!

16:09.736 --> 16:12.272
Hey, I think
that child lock is on.

16:13.038 --> 16:15.140
Yeah, we're here.

16:15.207 --> 16:17.745
The heart of Little Italy,
you son of a bitch.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.279
There's nothing here, Jim.
There's no bomb.

16:20.346 --> 16:21.361
Damn it.

16:21.361 --> 16:23.683
As long as we're here,
you want to try
the fresh mozz,

16:23.750 --> 16:26.452
or some <i>brajoot,</i>
as they say?

16:29.456 --> 16:32.158
Hey, so I was thinking,
if you're interested,

16:32.225 --> 16:34.761
maybe I'll turn
that thesis of mine
into a full novel.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.330
There it is.
[laughs]

16:37.397 --> 16:39.799
You play naive,
but you're better than that.

16:39.866 --> 16:42.201
You never cared
about the bomb, did you?

16:42.269 --> 16:43.570
You just wanted your story.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.706
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

16:45.773 --> 16:48.207
You're naughty,
Dr. Quinzel.

16:48.274 --> 16:51.711
-What happened to Harley?
-Well, Harley, I'm game.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.380
That is, if I can call this
our first date.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.081
[speaks Italian]

16:56.149 --> 16:58.519
-What's with the Italian?
-Oh, that's Luigi.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.522
His food's the reason
I keep coming back to Arkham.

17:01.587 --> 17:04.057
[laughs]
I mean, him and Batman.

17:04.057 --> 17:07.326
See, Luigi's got
a bit of a nickname
around here.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.063
-[Luigi grunting]
-Little Italy.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.699
-[Joker laughing]
-It feels no good.

17:11.765 --> 17:14.601
The flavor, really,
just explodes in your mouth.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.236
[laughing]

17:17.837 --> 17:19.306
Paint my toenails.

17:19.373 --> 17:20.708
You're not gonna believe this.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.710
The bomb was in a guy
named Little Italy.

17:22.776 --> 17:24.144
-Luigi.
-Wait.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.179
Where are you going,
Dark Knight?

17:26.246 --> 17:27.748
[alarms blaring]

17:27.815 --> 17:30.349
Why don't we dine al fresco?

17:30.416 --> 17:31.518
[alarm blaring]

17:34.421 --> 17:36.221
Where is he?

17:40.728 --> 17:42.328
You lying asshole!

17:42.395 --> 17:44.798
I told everyone
exactly where the bomb was,

17:44.865 --> 17:47.500
but you were the only one
who got the joke.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.801
Oh, my God! You're insane.

17:48.868 --> 17:51.838
Please, I gave you
what you wanted, a story.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.574
The story.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.209
Clown price of crime
kidnaps hotshot psychologist.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.111
Her tell-all sells millions.

17:58.178 --> 18:01.213
Baby, I'm about
to make you a star.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.799
Not if they kill us first.

18:02.799 --> 18:05.184
They're not going to kill me,
because they won't kill you.

18:05.184 --> 18:08.355
Honestly, you're safer here
than back at that looney bin.

18:08.422 --> 18:11.124
-Take the shot.
-Sir, I can't
without hitting her.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.326
Who gives a fuck?
I can't win this
goddamn election

18:13.326 --> 18:15.893
if Joker escapes
on my watch!

18:28.240 --> 18:30.410
-Ivy, you saved me!
-[Poison Ivy] Say what?

18:30.477 --> 18:33.780
I always knew
you had a special place
in your heart for the Joker.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.549
[Poison Ivy] Not you, asshole.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.385
Not bad for a first date,
eh, puddin'?

18:39.452 --> 18:41.488
Are, are you okay,
or whatever?

18:41.555 --> 18:42.789
Why did you save me?

18:42.855 --> 18:44.724
No one's ever given me
a gift before,

18:44.791 --> 18:48.428
I mean,
not to mention a plant.
So, that was nice.

18:51.932 --> 18:53.333
[Harleen gasps]

18:55.535 --> 18:57.634
Kill them all!

19:04.778 --> 19:07.180
Uh... I surrender.

19:07.247 --> 19:11.785
[Harvey sighs]

19:11.785 --> 19:14.621
Ow!

19:14.621 --> 19:17.890
So, Doc, I was thinking
of seeing a new therapist,

19:17.891 --> 19:19.291
if you could recommend, uh--

19:19.291 --> 19:20.594
-I'd love to.
-Cool.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.900
Dr. Quinzel, thank God
you're all right.

19:26.967 --> 19:28.535
Phew!

19:28.602 --> 19:29.903
Crazy night, huh?

19:29.970 --> 19:31.403
But it's a happy ending.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.373
Joker's captured,
I'll win re-election,

19:33.440 --> 19:35.843
and you've earned
yourself a promotion.
Congrats.

19:35.909 --> 19:37.309
We good?

19:37.376 --> 19:40.227
Fuck off, Two-Face.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.054
Bullshit. You came up
with Two-Face?

19:47.054 --> 19:48.922
And not a single royalty.

19:48.989 --> 19:51.423
-Ugh.
-Ive, you said humanity
wasn't worth saving,

19:51.423 --> 19:53.460
but then you saved me,
a human.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.895
Even though it meant
another year in Arkham.
I mean, thusly--

19:55.962 --> 19:57.897
-Don't say thusly.
-I changed you,

19:57.897 --> 20:00.333
which proves
your core can change.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.734
Harley wins again.

20:01.801 --> 20:02.803
God, you're so smug.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.771
Harley, you didn't change me.

20:04.837 --> 20:06.472
You helped me,
sure, you know,

20:06.472 --> 20:07.907
but I didn't always
hate people.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.342
It wasn't until
Mr. Ferris died.

20:09.342 --> 20:10.978
Mr. Ferris? You mean
Joker's Ferris?

20:11.045 --> 20:12.613
No, I mean Mr. Ferris,
the ficus.

20:12.613 --> 20:14.413
-He was my first plant.
-I don't understand.

20:14.413 --> 20:16.717
Harls, that was my story.
I told it in group therapy.

20:16.784 --> 20:18.018
Joker probably just stole it

20:18.085 --> 20:19.820
and weirdly changed it
into a ferret.

20:19.820 --> 20:23.423
What? I spent so much money
on ferret paraphernalia
over the years.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.625
His custom Christmas stocking
was a ferret.

20:25.692 --> 20:29.429
Well, as always, Joker lied,
surprising no one but you.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.730
The first time
my father hit me,

20:30.730 --> 20:32.701
that's when I gave up
on humans.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.701
Until I met you. [sighs]

20:34.768 --> 20:36.936
You never told me, Ive.
I'm sorry.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.905
Yeah, it was
a long time ago.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.606
So, what are we
gonna do about him?

20:42.576 --> 20:44.344
We call in a tie-breaker.

20:46.012 --> 20:51.012
-Oh, nice unit.
-Uh, can I help you?

20:52.618 --> 20:55.721
Hmm. Sugar, sugar, sugar.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.758
Nope. Oh, why not?
I'll splurge.

20:57.825 --> 21:00.760
Oh, boy.
This is way too stylish.

21:00.827 --> 21:03.329
Okay. There.
Ah, that's normal.

21:03.395 --> 21:05.365
Where's my new,
old lucky sock?

21:05.432 --> 21:06.700
There you are, buddy.

21:06.767 --> 21:09.402
[chuckles] Ho!

21:09.469 --> 21:11.038
[all laughing]

21:11.105 --> 21:12.439
What just happened?

21:13.906 --> 21:14.974
[Poison Ivy] Ugh!

21:15.041 --> 21:16.542
He really loves those kids.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.811
-That is disgusting.
-Ugh! I hated seeing it.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.700
And case closed.

21:20.700 --> 21:23.549
He's got zero memories from
before the tower collapsed.

21:23.549 --> 21:24.917
-You're welcome.
-All right, all right.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.553
I was wrong.
The old Joker is gone.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.154
I guess the acid
really did change him.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.390
Which is why
I just smoke joints.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.859
[laughs] Fuck you.
That was a good one.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.028
Papa needs his nap.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.430
I guess this is goodbye.

21:38.999 --> 21:41.768
[grunting]

21:41.835 --> 21:43.184
[humming]

21:48.142 --> 21:49.910
-Oh, jeez.
-Shoot.

21:49.977 --> 21:52.046
[grunts] Okay, enough.

21:52.112 --> 21:53.980
[Two-Face] Harley Quinn,
Poison Ivy.

21:54.048 --> 21:56.650
Good news, I'm the DA again.

21:56.717 --> 21:59.920
Bad news, you're under arrest.

22:01.788 --> 22:04.938
[cell phone vibrates]

22:07.626 --> 22:09.126
[laughing]

22:14.968 --> 22:16.502
[coughing]

22:17.871 --> 22:18.871
Oh.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.576
[humming]

22:24.178 --> 22:26.145
[theme music playing]
