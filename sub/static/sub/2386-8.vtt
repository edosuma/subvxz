WEBVTT

00:00.542 --> 00:02.492
<i>Kids, for years, your Uncle Barney</i>

00:02.493 --> 00:05.035
had reveled in mocking
Aunt Robin's Canadian heritage.

00:05.549 --> 00:07.687
To have to grow up
in Canada...

00:07.688 --> 00:09.704
with America right there.

00:09.706 --> 00:12.124
It's like an entire country
without a tailor.

00:12.126 --> 00:15.894
Why? Why do we let
you be a country?!

00:15.896 --> 00:20.715
<i>But all that was about</i>
<i>to change.</i>

00:20.717 --> 00:22.217
I was on Facebook.

00:22.219 --> 00:24.603
Nobody cool's
on Facebook anymore.

00:24.605 --> 00:26.522
Well, you know who is
on Facebook now?

00:26.524 --> 00:28.073
Everybody's parents.

00:28.075 --> 00:30.559
And I just happen
to be friends

00:30.561 --> 00:32.726
with Barney's long-lost father,

00:32.729 --> 00:34.229
Mr. Jerome Whitaker.
- Me, too.

00:34.231 --> 00:35.864
He's gotten really good
at Bejeweled Blitz.

00:35.866 --> 00:39.918
And guess who thought my status
update about Manitoba was

00:39.920 --> 00:45.123
so interesting because his
mother was born in Manitoba?

00:45.125 --> 00:46.458
What?

00:46.460 --> 00:48.743
Which means your grandmother...

00:48.745 --> 00:49.645
No...

00:49.647 --> 00:50.762
Which makes you...

00:50.764 --> 00:51.964
Don't say it!

00:51.966 --> 00:53.015
...one-quarter Canadian!

00:55.603 --> 00:57.636
Welcome to the tribe, hoser!

00:57.638 --> 00:59.721
No...

00:59.723 --> 01:01.857
it's not true!

01:01.859 --> 01:03.775
That's impossible!

01:21.971 --> 01:24.330
<i>Once upon a time</i>
<i>at a Halloween party,</i>

01:24.331 --> 01:26.731
<i>I met a girl</i>
<i>dressed like a pumpkin...</i>

01:26.733 --> 01:27.732
<i>a slutty pumpkin.</i>

01:27.734 --> 01:29.951
<i>And she was extraordinary.</i>

01:29.953 --> 01:32.671
<i>But she gave me her number</i>
<i>on a Kit Kat bar,</i>

01:32.673 --> 01:35.006
which was tragically given away
<i>as Halloween candy.</i>

01:35.008 --> 01:36.958
<i>So every year I return</i>
<i>to that same party</i>

01:36.960 --> 01:38.510
<i>hoping I'd see her again.</i>

01:38.512 --> 01:42.697
But with every passing October,
<i>that hope grew a little dimmer.</i>

01:42.699 --> 01:45.667
<i>Then one day, after ten years</i>
<i>of searching...</i>

01:45.669 --> 01:47.752
Oh, my God.

01:47.754 --> 01:50.021
The slutty pumpkin.

01:50.023 --> 01:52.924
This might sound creepy,
but do you have a record

01:52.926 --> 01:54.593
of who rented it in 2001?

01:57.613 --> 01:58.930
Wow, that was easy.

01:58.932 --> 02:00.815
You're not the first lovelorn
young man

02:00.817 --> 02:01.933
to walk through that door.

02:01.935 --> 02:04.236
Three girls got proposals off

02:04.238 --> 02:07.155
my wife's slutty artichoke
costume.

02:07.157 --> 02:10.491
Two others disappeared,
but I focus on the positive.

02:10.494 --> 02:13.211
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>
<i>I actually had her address.</i>

02:13.213 --> 02:15.430
<i>I knew I had</i>
<i>to play this right.</i>

02:15.432 --> 02:19.134
It's not like I could just walk
<i>up and knock on her door.</i>

02:22.838 --> 02:26.124
Hi, you probably
don't remember me, but...

02:26.126 --> 02:28.626
Halloween, ten years ago.

02:29.428 --> 02:31.897
Now that's a slow play.

02:31.899 --> 02:35.800
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>Lily and Marshall headed out</i>

02:35.802 --> 02:37.319
<i>to Lily's grandparents</i>
<i>for dinner.</i>

02:37.321 --> 02:39.304
<i>Marshall loved it</i>
<i>out in the 'burbs.</i>

02:39.306 --> 02:40.972
Look how many fireflies
I caught!

02:40.974 --> 02:44.142
Don't forget to poke holes
in the jar this time.

02:44.944 --> 02:47.979
Now we have
a nice surprise for you.

02:49.081 --> 02:51.366
Whatever it is,
we're saying no.

02:51.368 --> 02:53.501
- What?
- You know what.

02:53.503 --> 02:54.753
Every time we're here,

02:54.755 --> 02:57.038
my grandparents stick us with
some big old piece of junk

02:57.040 --> 02:58.489
they're getting rid of.

02:58.491 --> 03:01.343
It's like the world's worst
Showcase Showdown.

03:01.345 --> 03:05.046
It's a perfectly
usable lawnmower!

03:06.466 --> 03:08.016
We live in an apartment!

03:08.018 --> 03:09.267
But maybe someday

03:09.269 --> 03:10.719
when we move to the suburbs...

03:10.721 --> 03:12.554
We're never moving
to the suburbs!

03:12.556 --> 03:13.638
And you also get...

03:13.640 --> 03:16.141
this skinny microphone!

03:16.143 --> 03:17.892
Oh!

03:17.894 --> 03:21.346
Before we head out
to our place in Florida,

03:21.348 --> 03:23.865
we wanted to give
our favorite granddaughter

03:23.867 --> 03:25.533
a little something.

03:25.535 --> 03:29.871
Ooh, it's so small.
I love it!

03:29.873 --> 03:32.374
- A key?
- We're giving you the house.

03:32.376 --> 03:36.161
Lily, I know you've
always hated the suburbs...

03:36.163 --> 03:38.797
We'll take it!

03:38.799 --> 03:41.583
<i>For my first date</i>
<i>with the slutty pumpkin,</i>

03:41.585 --> 03:43.218
<i>I took her someplace special.</i>

03:43.220 --> 03:44.869
Ted, this is so romantic.

03:44.871 --> 03:46.805
The spot where
we first met

03:46.807 --> 03:48.506
ten years ago.

03:48.508 --> 03:50.592
Do you remember the song
that was playing that night?

03:50.594 --> 03:53.345
I remember how beautiful
you looked.

03:53.347 --> 03:56.047
♪ It's been one week
since you looked at me ♪

03:56.049 --> 03:58.984
♪ Cocked your head to the side
and said, "I'm angry." ♪

03:58.986 --> 04:00.935
Is that, uh,
the Barenaked Ladies, huh?

04:00.937 --> 04:02.604
♪ Five days since you laughed
at me ♪

04:02.606 --> 04:04.823
♪ Saying, "Get that together.
Come back and see me." ♪

04:04.825 --> 04:09.077
<i>Kids, it took me ten years,</i>
<i>but I finally kissed her.</i>

04:09.079 --> 04:12.563
<i>And it was... terrible.</i>

04:19.771 --> 04:21.271
Lily, you hate the suburbs.

04:21.387 --> 04:23.854
I know, but my grandparents
giving us a house

04:23.856 --> 04:25.389
right when
the baby's on the way?

04:25.391 --> 04:26.506
It's perfect timing.

04:26.508 --> 04:28.525
This is great.
I'm finally gonna be able

04:28.527 --> 04:30.844
to barbecue with
proper ventilation.

04:32.180 --> 04:33.731
Marshall!

04:34.699 --> 04:36.233
We're moving
to the suburbs, baby!

04:36.235 --> 04:38.235
Oh...

04:38.237 --> 04:40.738
Okay.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.623
Baby, you're not moving
to the suburbs.

04:42.625 --> 04:43.574
Why not?

04:43.576 --> 04:44.958
Lily is only agreeing

04:44.960 --> 04:46.710
to all this because
of Pregnancy Brain.

04:46.712 --> 04:48.796
Pregnancy Brain?
That's not a thing.

04:48.798 --> 04:50.030
It's totally a thing.

04:50.032 --> 04:54.668
Her brain is marinating in
a cocktail of hormones,

04:54.670 --> 04:57.254
mood swings and jacked-up
nesting instincts.

04:57.256 --> 05:00.557
I mean, yes, right now
Lily is a goddess

05:00.559 --> 05:02.309
bestowing the
miracle of life,

05:02.311 --> 05:04.845
but damn, she dumb!

05:04.847 --> 05:08.182
Well, I have noticed some stuff.

05:08.184 --> 05:11.018
I can't find my keys
or wallet anywhere!

05:11.020 --> 05:13.053
I found them...

05:13.055 --> 05:15.555
here in the freezer.

05:15.557 --> 05:17.524
Hey, but where are
the ice cube trays?

05:17.526 --> 05:19.643
No idea.

05:21.079 --> 05:25.065
Those poor ice cubes!

05:25.067 --> 05:28.085
I guess she has been
a little off lately.

05:28.087 --> 05:29.920
A little? She just texted me

05:29.922 --> 05:32.773
wanting directions back
from the bathroom.

05:32.775 --> 05:36.293
Oh. We're over here!

05:37.412 --> 05:39.179
You're doing great, sweetie!

05:39.181 --> 05:42.249
That moron should not be making
big life decisions right now.

05:42.251 --> 05:43.884
If you let her move
to the suburbs,

05:43.886 --> 05:45.936
it would be like taking
advantage

05:45.938 --> 05:47.471
of a helpless drunk chick.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.690
What? Where?!

05:49.692 --> 05:52.359
Oh, I got a girlfriend, right.

05:54.629 --> 05:56.447
Baby, we should put
off moving.

05:56.449 --> 05:57.448
Why?

05:57.450 --> 05:59.199
Because I think
the pregnancy is

05:59.201 --> 06:00.284
affecting your judgment.

06:00.286 --> 06:04.772
No, Marshall, this is
an amazing opportunity

06:04.774 --> 06:07.107
that we have
to take advantage of!

06:07.109 --> 06:09.710
Just because my body
is growing a fungus...

06:09.712 --> 06:11.211
Fetus.

06:11.213 --> 06:12.479
...doesn't mean that my metal
factories...

06:12.481 --> 06:14.214
Meal faculties.

06:14.216 --> 06:16.300
...are in any way funicular.

06:17.969 --> 06:19.470
No idea.

06:20.305 --> 06:24.007
Mmm...

06:24.009 --> 06:25.459
This is nice.
What is this?

06:25.461 --> 06:26.626
Canadian whiskey.

06:28.229 --> 06:31.131
I want scotch!

06:31.133 --> 06:35.519
American scotch
from Scotland!

06:35.521 --> 06:37.971
Get that swill
away from me!

06:41.109 --> 06:43.243
Why are you doing
this to me?

06:43.245 --> 06:45.112
You have been ripping
on Canada

06:45.114 --> 06:47.647
since Justin Bieber was
knee-high to a snow blower.

06:47.649 --> 06:50.650
So now this Canuck's
gonna beat on you

06:50.652 --> 06:53.504
like the drummer from Yukon
Blonde hopped up on Timbits.

06:53.506 --> 06:55.756
- Hey.
- Hey!

06:55.758 --> 06:56.707
How was your

06:56.709 --> 06:58.509
big date with
the Snuffy Tuffkin?

06:58.511 --> 06:59.826
The Sniffy Napkin?

06:59.828 --> 07:03.380
The Slouchy Foreskin?

07:03.382 --> 07:04.664
Lily tie-tie.

07:04.666 --> 07:08.268
It was good... ish.

07:09.170 --> 07:11.838
Look, there's Orion's Belt.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.106
Oh.

07:13.108 --> 07:15.225
<i>Why does holding hands feel</i>
<i>this weird?</i>

07:15.227 --> 07:17.394
<i>Should our fingers</i>
<i>not intertwine?</i>

07:17.396 --> 07:20.647
<i>What's causing that</i>
<i>pinching feeling?</i>

07:20.649 --> 07:22.849
<i>I'll just cup her hand.</i>

07:22.851 --> 07:25.185
<i>There. That's...</i>

07:25.187 --> 07:27.204
<i>not great.</i>

07:30.825 --> 07:34.027
<i>Her hair's up my nose.</i>

07:34.029 --> 07:37.548
<i>Her shoulder's jabbing</i>
<i>into my windpipe.</i>

07:37.550 --> 07:39.299
<i>Maybe if we reposition.</i>

07:44.472 --> 07:45.872
I have to say something.

07:45.874 --> 07:47.391
She must be feeling it, too.

07:47.393 --> 07:49.209
This feels so right.

07:49.211 --> 07:52.012
We fit like two puzzle pieces.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.230
Yeah.

07:53.232 --> 07:56.600
Ted, I know you've waited
ten years for this girl,

07:56.602 --> 07:58.718
but some things
just aren't meant to be.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.854
Not so fast.
At the end of the night,

08:00.856 --> 08:03.657
when I leaned in and somehow
accidentally kissed

08:03.659 --> 08:06.660
her open eyeball, there was a
slight flicker of something

08:06.662 --> 08:09.746
I might even call chemistry...

08:09.748 --> 08:11.248
adjacent.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.400
Thank you.

08:13.402 --> 08:14.918
Wait.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.005
Where is my cash?

08:18.007 --> 08:19.590
Oh, yeah,

08:19.592 --> 08:22.292
I did a little exchange
for ya, Canucklehead.

08:22.294 --> 08:25.712
This Canadian dollar here
is called a "loonie."

08:25.714 --> 08:30.100
And this two-dollar coin?
A "toonie." True story.

08:30.102 --> 08:33.270
It's federal currency
and you people talk about it

08:33.272 --> 08:35.304
like it's a Hannah-
Barbera character.

08:35.307 --> 08:38.225
Not you people, Barney.

08:38.227 --> 08:39.726
Our people.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.195
<i>Even though my first date</i>
<i>with Naomi was</i>

08:42.197 --> 08:43.363
<i>a little awkward,</i>

08:43.365 --> 08:45.432
<i>our second date was</i>
<i>a lot awkward.</i>

08:45.434 --> 08:46.867
Mmm...!

08:46.869 --> 08:49.903
<i>This is the worst</i>
<i>kissing of all time!</i>

08:49.905 --> 08:50.937
Mmm...

08:50.939 --> 08:52.739
<i>How could she possibly</i>
<i>be into this?</i>

08:53.626 --> 08:55.075
<i>She sounds like</i>
<i>those cows in</i>

08:55.077 --> 08:56.443
<i>Temple Grandin's</i>
<i>hug machines.</i>

08:56.445 --> 08:58.712
Do you want to listen
to some music?

08:58.714 --> 08:59.563
Uh-huh!

09:06.171 --> 09:07.754
Ted, this is our song.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.890
Let's make love to this song.

09:11.476 --> 09:13.677
♪ Chickety China,

09:13.679 --> 09:15.295

09:22.437 --> 09:23.437
Hey, doofus!

09:23.439 --> 09:25.439
It's me:
you at age 15.

09:25.441 --> 09:26.657
And we made a deal

09:26.659 --> 09:29.993
we would always boink any chick
that wants to boink us!

09:29.995 --> 09:31.244
Yes, she's beautiful,

09:31.246 --> 09:33.580
it's just there's
no connection there.

09:33.582 --> 09:35.148
I don't feel intimate with her.

09:35.150 --> 09:36.950
"Intimate"? Let me remind you
of some things

09:36.952 --> 09:39.286
you did feel "intimate" with
when you were 15:

09:39.288 --> 09:40.420
a catcher's mitt,

09:40.422 --> 09:42.989
an oven mitt,
a glass of warm water,

09:42.991 --> 09:46.627
a half-open hide-a-bed sofa,
a top-loading VCR!

09:46.629 --> 09:47.878
It's not gonna happen!

09:47.880 --> 09:50.514
Come on!

09:50.516 --> 09:53.684
It'll take, like, 30 seconds!

09:55.169 --> 09:56.520
Naomi, listen...

09:56.522 --> 09:59.523
Shh...

10:02.560 --> 10:03.694
You like that, Ted?

10:03.696 --> 10:04.861
Hmm.

10:04.863 --> 10:08.398
Do you ike it
when I caress your hair?

10:08.400 --> 10:11.851
Your hair is
so nice to caress.

10:11.853 --> 10:13.954
<i>Why is she saying that word?</i>

10:13.956 --> 10:16.406
I like to caress your hair.

10:16.408 --> 10:20.243
<i>There it is again! "Caress!"</i>
<i>Who says that?</i>

10:20.245 --> 10:23.246
Caress.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.866
The thing is,
I like her, okay?

10:26.868 --> 10:28.969
I really, really like her.

10:28.971 --> 10:32.139
I just don't seem to like
anything she says or does.

10:32.974 --> 10:34.891
I have to break up
with her, don't I?

10:34.893 --> 10:35.942
Yes!

10:35.944 --> 10:37.978
After you sleep with her, yes!

10:39.046 --> 10:40.714
Marshall, I've been thinking
about what you said.

10:40.716 --> 10:43.567
You're right, we shouldn't
move to the suburbs.

10:43.569 --> 10:46.603
Let's not make any huge life
decisions right now.

10:46.605 --> 10:48.522
Is this because you tried
to make waffles

10:48.524 --> 10:49.723
with the laptop this morning?

10:49.725 --> 10:53.160
Anyway, I'm gonna call
a real estate broker

10:53.162 --> 10:54.945
to come look at the
house tomorrow.

10:54.947 --> 10:56.546
Oh, by the way,

10:56.548 --> 10:58.699
I ordered those Minnesota
Vikings drapes.

10:58.701 --> 11:01.918
You're right, they're totally
gonna class up our apartment.

11:04.722 --> 11:07.641
Okay, yes. It's wrong
to bang a drunk chick.

11:07.643 --> 11:10.744
But you're an idiot if you don't
get, like, a little something.

11:13.264 --> 11:14.264
Yo, Canada.

11:14.266 --> 11:16.383
What? Dammit!

11:16.385 --> 11:18.251
Ha, you answer to "Canada" now.

11:20.071 --> 11:21.354
I'll make you a deal.

11:21.356 --> 11:22.723
You wear this costume

11:22.725 --> 11:24.641
to the Halloween party
tomorrow night,

11:24.643 --> 11:26.810
I'll drop it forever.

11:29.697 --> 11:31.732
You can't be serious.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.651
Oh, I am as serious
as a poutine shortage

11:34.653 --> 11:37.237
in Chicoutimi during
a curling bonspiel.

11:37.239 --> 11:40.940
I don't know what
any of those words mean.

11:40.942 --> 11:43.126
Yes. You do.

11:47.783 --> 11:50.133
Oh, that must be the broker.
Marshall, will you get it?

11:50.135 --> 11:52.302
Sure. Of course.

11:52.304 --> 11:55.222
Trick or treat!

11:55.224 --> 11:57.624
Oh, my gosh. How cute!

11:57.626 --> 11:59.392
I'm sorry, we don't
have any candy.

11:59.394 --> 12:01.178
Um, we forgot about
trick-or-treaters.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.395
We don't get any where we live.

12:02.397 --> 12:05.315
Yup. Only get this
kind of cuteness

12:05.317 --> 12:06.650
in the suburbs.

12:08.469 --> 12:13.490
Oh. Look at how sweet and
happy and unarmed they all are!

12:13.492 --> 12:16.660
Are you using adorable
little children in costumes

12:16.662 --> 12:17.828
to manipulate me?
- Bye!

12:17.830 --> 12:19.979
I mean, did you even call
a real estate broker?

12:19.981 --> 12:21.865
No.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.950
I've got Pregnancy Brain
like a fiddle

12:23.952 --> 12:27.420

I'm going to love it here.

14:36.538 --> 14:40.123
Oh, we'd have so much
room in the suburbs.

14:40.125 --> 14:44.326
You can get that pinball
machine you've always wanted.

14:44.328 --> 14:47.380
You can put it
anywhere you want.

14:47.382 --> 14:50.099
Stop it. You don't
know what you're saying.

14:50.101 --> 14:51.551
Anywhere.

14:51.553 --> 14:55.054

14:55.056 --> 14:57.356
you can stick it in the back.

14:58.559 --> 15:01.894
Lily, I want to be
inside this house so bad.

15:01.896 --> 15:04.831
USA! USA!

15:04.833 --> 15:06.132
USA!

15:06.134 --> 15:07.533
Come on!

15:07.535 --> 15:09.869
Okay, so rather than
wearing a Mountie costume

15:09.871 --> 15:11.320
and end this forever,

15:11.322 --> 15:13.189
you show up shirtless
to an outdoor party?

15:13.191 --> 15:14.540
It's practically November.

15:14.542 --> 15:16.959
No biggie. I ain't cold.

15:16.961 --> 15:18.961
Huh. Interesting.

15:18.963 --> 15:20.463
It's fascinating.

15:20.465 --> 15:23.499
Almost as if your body was
accustomed to low temperatures

15:23.501 --> 15:26.385
after generations of adapting.

15:26.387 --> 15:27.970
Canada.

15:27.972 --> 15:29.055
No.

15:29.057 --> 15:31.874
Guys, hey. Robin,
Barney, this is Naomi.

15:31.876 --> 15:33.259
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:33.261 --> 15:35.928
Nice to meet you guys.

15:35.930 --> 15:39.265
I'm gonna go make some Tootsie
Rolls. It's a drink I invented.

15:39.267 --> 15:40.233
There's a song and dance

15:40.235 --> 15:41.768
that goes along with it,
but I have to

15:41.770 --> 15:43.102
drink three of them
before I can do it.

15:45.222 --> 15:46.873
Oh.
Okay. You go.

15:46.875 --> 15:48.691
This way.

15:50.110 --> 15:53.229
Sounds delicious.
In theory.

15:53.231 --> 15:55.564
But you never know
until you taste it.

15:55.566 --> 15:59.902
Ted... have you tasted
her Tootsie Roll?

15:59.904 --> 16:00.920
Of course not.

16:00.922 --> 16:03.172
- Ow.
- Wait. Have you?

16:05.293 --> 16:07.760
You had sex with someone you
have zero feelings for!

16:07.762 --> 16:09.078
U-S-A!

16:09.080 --> 16:10.129
U-S...

16:10.131 --> 16:12.265
Stop it.

16:12.267 --> 16:14.100
Just no part of it felt right.

16:14.102 --> 16:16.385
At first there was too much
eye contact, then not enough.

16:16.387 --> 16:18.420
Where do you look during sex?

16:18.422 --> 16:21.057
Um, into the hidden camera
at future me watching it.

16:23.060 --> 16:24.310
Okay. Wait. How does

16:24.312 --> 16:26.562
saying "I want to break up
with you" lead into sex?

16:26.564 --> 16:29.866
I didn't say "I want to
break up with you," exactly.

16:29.868 --> 16:31.484
What did you say, exactly?

16:33.620 --> 16:34.737
"I love you."

16:34.739 --> 16:37.273
Classic Schmosby.

16:38.343 --> 16:42.829
Marshall, this house
wants you so bad.

16:42.831 --> 16:45.248
"Mow my lawn.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.883
"Rake my leaves.

16:46.885 --> 16:48.751
Winterize my pipes""

16:48.753 --> 16:49.919
Yes!

16:49.921 --> 16:51.587
Yes! I'm coming...

16:51.589 --> 16:53.289
to terms with this decision!

16:53.291 --> 16:55.224
Oh!

16:55.226 --> 16:57.093
Trick or treat!

16:57.095 --> 16:57.810
Yay!

16:57.812 --> 17:00.012
Okay.

17:00.814 --> 17:03.099
Oh.

17:03.101 --> 17:04.433
Happy Halloween.

17:06.686 --> 17:09.355
- Lily.
- Yeah?

17:09.357 --> 17:10.823
You just gave
those children

17:10.825 --> 17:13.976
a stapler,
a pair of sharp scissors,

17:13.978 --> 17:16.279
and a pretty decent
Pinot Noir.

17:16.281 --> 17:17.663
I did?

17:18.582 --> 17:20.532
Oh, my God.

17:20.535 --> 17:24.369
I'm going to miss
that stapler so much.

17:26.790 --> 17:29.926
I'm not doing
so great, am I?

17:29.928 --> 17:31.961
Maybe not.

17:33.714 --> 17:36.799
We shouldn't make any
huge life decisions

17:36.801 --> 17:38.434
right now, should we?

17:38.436 --> 17:43.272
Hey, look, I love you and
I-I love the idea of raising

17:43.274 --> 17:45.358
our kids with a lawn
and a white picket fence,

17:45.360 --> 17:47.509
but we have our whole lives
to decide when

17:47.511 --> 17:49.812
and if we want
to do that.

17:49.814 --> 17:52.014
Do what?

17:52.016 --> 17:54.567
Let's get you home.

17:59.957 --> 18:01.624
Ooh.

18:01.626 --> 18:04.193
That's for the stapler!

18:04.195 --> 18:06.362
I hate the suburbs.

18:09.918 --> 18:10.917
Naomi...

18:10.919 --> 18:12.534
We have to
end this.

18:12.536 --> 18:13.535
W-- huh?

18:13.537 --> 18:15.171
I'm sorry, Tootsie Rolls make me

18:15.173 --> 18:17.556
really honest.

18:17.558 --> 18:22.395
Ted... I know
you're super into me.

18:23.347 --> 18:24.847
But we are terrible together.

18:24.849 --> 18:26.515
Wait, what?

18:26.517 --> 18:30.853
I've been trying, saying things
felt good that didn't just to...

18:32.439 --> 18:35.324
I thought saying it was good
would make it feel good, but...

18:37.160 --> 18:39.829
...it always felt off.

18:42.250 --> 18:45.334
<i>Why won't he stop</i>

18:45.336 --> 18:46.836

<i>It's like he's trying</i>

18:50.508 --> 18:53.742
Ted, this is our song.

18:53.744 --> 18:56.429
<i>Oh, no, he thinks</i>
<i>I'm actually into this song.</i>

18:56.431 --> 18:58.547
<i>Does he not get sarcasm?</i>

18:58.549 --> 19:01.517
Let's make love to this song.

19:01.519 --> 19:02.852
<i>I'll just be even more</i>
<i>ridiculous</i>

19:02.854 --> 19:04.854

for the last nine Halloweens.

19:25.827 --> 19:27.660
I've waded
through a sweaty parade

19:27.662 --> 19:30.046
of Big Lebowskis, Harry Potters,

19:30.048 --> 19:32.048
Antoine Dodsons,

19:33.885 --> 19:35.251
Oh, I hate that guy.

19:35.253 --> 19:37.970
That's why,
once I finally found you...

19:38.839 --> 19:42.141
...it was hard to let you go.

19:43.343 --> 19:44.977
Good-bye, Ted.

19:48.965 --> 19:51.734
Let's just not touch ever again.
