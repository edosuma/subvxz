WEBVTT

00:01.519 --> 00:02.713
My God!

00:03.321 --> 00:04.413
Hi, Higgins.

00:04.989 --> 00:07.457
You have received some
stolen goods from James Bonig.

00:07.525 --> 00:08.822
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:11.062 --> 00:12.689
I'm gonna kill him.

00:14.198 --> 00:16.166
Will you stop that?
<i>Hai.</i>

00:16.233 --> 00:18.531
Ice Pick, I told you,
Thomas will get
your cash back.

00:18.602 --> 00:19.660
I don't have the money.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.129
I gotta break both your legs.

00:24.875 --> 00:26.001
Get him, Mac!

00:26.243 --> 00:27.267
Right.

00:27.578 --> 00:28.738
Mac!

01:45.456 --> 01:47.083
Just a little lower.

01:48.592 --> 01:49.854
Yeah.

01:52.263 --> 01:54.231
You girls are terrific,
you know that?

01:55.866 --> 02:00.098
Say, did you ever see the
Statue of Liberty or the
Washington Monument or the...

02:01.138 --> 02:04.073
Or the overripe American
about to burst?

02:06.811 --> 02:07.800
Kanki.

02:09.246 --> 02:10.838
How the hell are you, buddy?

02:11.048 --> 02:14.176
Betrayed, hurt,
possibly foolish.

02:14.785 --> 02:15.979
You tell me, James.

02:16.454 --> 02:19.981
You know, I really wasn't
sure myself whether or not
those diamonds were real.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.820
I mean, I'll tell you what.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.689
You're like a dad to me.

02:23.761 --> 02:26.525
Why don't you let me
make it up to you? Okay?

02:28.065 --> 02:29.225
Not okay.

02:29.467 --> 02:32.561
You have offended
my affection for you
and my intelligence.

02:32.837 --> 02:35.032
Come on, it was just
a slight misjudgment.

02:35.106 --> 02:37.631
How was I supposed to
know those diamonds...
Silence.

02:37.875 --> 02:40.139
The more you talk,
the more I grow angry.

02:40.544 --> 02:43.172
No man has ever done
such a thing to me and lived.

02:43.447 --> 02:45.142
But you mean
a lot to me, James.

02:45.216 --> 02:47.446
Shoot, you know
how I feel
about you, Kanki.

02:48.052 --> 02:51.647
Say, why don't we just
forget this whole silly
thing ever happened

02:51.722 --> 02:54.247
and have a cup of sake
and a good laugh?

02:54.658 --> 02:57.752
After I cut off your finger.
It is a great honor.

02:58.963 --> 03:01.488
I don't deserve it.
I don't deserve it, really.

03:01.632 --> 03:03.293
I will return in one hour.

03:03.767 --> 03:04.927
In the meantime,

03:05.970 --> 03:07.460
enjoy yourself

03:07.571 --> 03:11.166
and think about what it means
to betray one who once thought
of you as a son.

03:22.353 --> 03:23.843
Sakiko, guess what?

03:23.954 --> 03:25.114
What, Bonig-san?

03:25.389 --> 03:27.983
I don't know how to exactly
tell you this, but...

03:30.194 --> 03:31.183
Well,

03:31.395 --> 03:33.761
instead of money
for those diamonds
I sold Kanki,

03:33.831 --> 03:35.628
he wants to give me
you girls instead.

03:35.699 --> 03:36.859
Isn't that something?

03:36.934 --> 03:39.425
You mean, you are
our new master?

03:39.970 --> 03:41.460
Yeah, you got it.

03:50.214 --> 03:53.775
Say, there wouldn't happen
to be another door
out of here, would there?

03:54.952 --> 03:56.180
Good.

04:29.620 --> 04:34.182
<i>A few vital statistics</i>
<i>that explain why paradise</i>
<i>is called paradise.</i>

04:35.025 --> 04:37.926
<i>There are 326 days</i>
<i>of sunshine each year,</i>

04:37.995 --> 04:40.589
<i>an annual average temperature</i>
<i>of 86 degrees,</i>

04:40.664 --> 04:43.599
<i>billions and billions</i>
<i>of gallons of blue Pacific</i>

04:43.767 --> 04:46.600
<i>and one Orville "Rick" Wright,</i>

04:47.004 --> 04:48.938
<i>who will bet on anything.</i>

04:49.006 --> 04:49.995
Hi, Rick.

04:50.274 --> 04:53.766
Don't "Hi, Rick" me, Thomas.
Just get on the boat
and enjoy the day.

04:53.844 --> 04:55.072
And remember,
anybody asks you,

04:55.145 --> 04:56.373
you're a charter member
of the club

04:56.447 --> 04:58.472
and your last
name is Wong.

04:58.816 --> 05:00.340
Wong?
Right.

05:00.684 --> 05:04.085
Come on, Rick.
You're not still
mad at me, are you?

05:04.154 --> 05:07.021
I mean, a bet's a bet.
You've got to be gracious
about these things.

05:07.091 --> 05:09.958
Gracious?
A 10-point spread
on a soccer game?

05:10.027 --> 05:13.485
Well, serves me right for
betting on a dumb sport where
I can't pronounce the names

05:13.564 --> 05:15.259
and they play
with their feet.

05:15.432 --> 05:17.992
I hope you don't
catch nothing.

05:19.403 --> 05:20.529
Hi, guys.

05:20.604 --> 05:21.764
Hi, Mr. Wong.

05:21.839 --> 05:23.966
Could you hand me down
my tackle and my cooler,
please?

05:24.041 --> 05:25.235
A bet's a bet.

05:37.154 --> 05:38.143
Mac.

05:38.989 --> 05:39.978
Mac.

05:40.624 --> 05:41.921
Mac!

05:52.970 --> 05:54.494
I'll be right back!

05:58.709 --> 06:01.473
You're history.
You're dead meat!

06:01.545 --> 06:02.842
Leave master alone.

06:02.913 --> 06:04.403
Come on, Rick,
stop it.

06:04.481 --> 06:06.108
Get away,
leave him alone!
- Get me out of here!

06:06.183 --> 06:07.172
Stop it.

06:10.421 --> 06:13.356
Rick, what a coincidence.
I haven't seen you in...

06:13.424 --> 06:14.516
Five weeks.

06:14.591 --> 06:17.719
Yeah, I guess that's
what they mean by absence
making the heart grow fonder.

06:17.795 --> 06:18.887
Fonder?

06:18.962 --> 06:20.554
Come on, stop it!

06:20.631 --> 06:21.757
Let me go,
I'm gonna
kill him.

06:21.832 --> 06:22.821
Stop it!

06:25.369 --> 06:27.633
You're not still mad
about that little...

06:27.705 --> 06:28.865
Congratulations.

06:29.239 --> 06:32.834
You just won dinner for two
at Honolulu's famed
King Kamehameha Club,

06:33.377 --> 06:36.778
courtesy of Rick Wright.
No, I'm not mad.

06:36.847 --> 06:37.973
Why should I be mad?

06:39.016 --> 06:40.074
Cut it out.

06:42.519 --> 06:44.350
Will you stop that?
<i>Hai.</i>

06:44.421 --> 06:46.013
Look, I can explain
the whole thing.

06:46.090 --> 06:48.684
Mac, come on.
The raffle winners
identified your picture.

06:48.759 --> 06:51.592
They said you called
yourself Floyd,
Orville's brother.

06:51.662 --> 06:52.856
Yeah.

06:52.930 --> 06:55.455
But are you gonna be happy
when I tell you
the whole thing. Now, look...

06:55.532 --> 06:58.968
Happy? Happy?
A hundred tickets?
Two hundred dinners?

06:59.036 --> 07:00.697
Yeah. I kept
the concept small.

07:00.771 --> 07:02.602
Look, I know how
exclusive that club is.

07:02.673 --> 07:06.507
Very exclusive,
and very scared
of bad PR.

07:06.643 --> 07:09.669
I mean, Higgins and the board
not only made Rick
honor the tickets,

07:09.747 --> 07:11.408
they made him
pick up the tab.

07:11.515 --> 07:12.675
Three grand.

07:12.750 --> 07:14.445
Gee, that's great!

07:14.651 --> 07:16.175
Great, huh? Great?

07:16.253 --> 07:19.654
Yeah, 'cause I happen
to have sold six grand worth
of raffle tickets.

07:19.723 --> 07:21.953
All of which you can write off
on your taxes, by the way.

07:22.025 --> 07:23.856
Now, how's that
for doubling your money?

07:23.927 --> 07:27.419
And the profits from the
dinner winner contest

07:29.366 --> 07:33.359
went to buy some grateful
shut-ins in Long Beach
a color television set.

07:34.671 --> 07:35.933
A 13-inch?

07:36.240 --> 07:39.107
Six grand for a 13-inch
color television set?

07:39.176 --> 07:40.541
With a remote control.

07:41.745 --> 07:44.305
Okay, okay, I had
some administrative
and travel expenses,

07:44.381 --> 07:45.541
but I can come up
with the receipts.

07:45.616 --> 07:47.106
You just come up
with my money.

07:47.851 --> 07:50.183
I can't believe you take that
attitude, Rick. Okay, fine.

07:50.254 --> 07:52.449
Hey, listen, I'll gladly
take the deduction

07:52.523 --> 07:55.390
and I'll give you back
your measly three grand
in five days.

07:55.459 --> 07:56.517
Mac.

07:56.593 --> 07:58.584
Now look,
just listen to me
for a minute, okay?

07:58.662 --> 08:00.960
I'm down here today
to set sail for Maui,

08:01.031 --> 08:03.363
where I'm going
to sell that.

08:07.070 --> 08:10.267
Then I'm gonna fly to Frisco,
where I'm gonna buy
a Japanese restaurant

08:10.340 --> 08:13.002
for Sakiko
and her sisters.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.337
And I guarantee you
there'll be at least
three grand change from that.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.009
That boat?
- Yep.

08:18.348 --> 08:19.906
- Those girls?
- Yep.

08:20.517 --> 08:23.543
Nope. I'm not
gonna stay here
and listen to this.

08:24.121 --> 08:27.613
Because none of it's
gonna be true. And all that
can happen is trouble. No.

08:27.691 --> 08:28.749
I'm leaving.

08:28.826 --> 08:31.727
I'm going around that corner
and I'm going to spend
the day fishing,

08:31.795 --> 08:35.663
even if I do have
to answer to Wong.
I don't care. Bye.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.089
Wait!

08:39.303 --> 08:40.327
Wait!

08:40.404 --> 08:41.597
Bye, Mr. Wong.

08:41.672 --> 08:42.866
Wait, guys!

08:48.378 --> 08:51.541
What a tragedy.
You know, Leeann
really loved me.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.109
Maybe too much.

08:54.117 --> 08:57.746
Anyway, for the two years
the relationship lasted,
it was a beautiful one.

08:58.522 --> 09:02.083
You know, she had oil wells
in her back yard, literally.

09:02.159 --> 09:05.959
She bought me a Porsche,
she bought me a beach house,
this boat.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.056
And I blew it.

09:09.766 --> 09:11.461
How could you blow it?

09:11.835 --> 09:13.769
Well, Leanne found me

09:13.837 --> 09:17.000
in a compromising situation
with another lady.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.206
Couldn't you explain?

09:19.910 --> 09:22.811
Well, of course I did.
It was perfectly innocent,
really.

09:23.313 --> 09:27.079
I was merely demonstrating
a little-known technique
for curing the hiccups,

09:27.150 --> 09:29.448
and Leeann understood that
and everything was fine

09:29.520 --> 09:32.546
until she caught me
demonstrating
that same technique

09:32.623 --> 09:35.854
with a blonde
in the beach house
and a brunette in the Porsche.

09:36.193 --> 09:38.627
Yeah, and these three
on the boat.

09:39.763 --> 09:42.732
No, no, no.
These girls are my crew.

09:44.234 --> 09:46.896
Anyway, Leeann
gave me the yacht
for old times' sake,

09:47.638 --> 09:49.799
but cash wins out
over sentiment.

09:50.007 --> 09:54.603
So tomorrow I leave Maui
with 115 in cash and pay
you your three grand back.

09:54.978 --> 09:56.240
Wait a minute.

09:57.481 --> 09:58.971
You gotta be kidding.

10:01.818 --> 10:02.807
Mac,

10:05.622 --> 10:07.419
this is worth
twice that much.

10:07.491 --> 10:10.392
Not to me.
I don't like boats.
I'd rather have a restaurant.

10:13.664 --> 10:16.827
Mac, you don't have
to give it away.

10:17.067 --> 10:19.467
I mean,
with a setup like this,
you can go into business

10:19.536 --> 10:21.128
and make twice as much
as a Japanese restaurant.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.728
What kind
of a business?

10:24.141 --> 10:25.130
Well,

10:25.309 --> 10:26.799
I guess it's
a dumb idea.

10:26.877 --> 10:29.539
You mean, like a charter boat?
You mean rent it out
to fishermen,

10:29.613 --> 10:31.046
like the <i>King Kamehameha II?</i>

10:32.182 --> 10:35.447
Rick, you're dreaming.
This tug's way out
of your league.

10:35.519 --> 10:37.009
I mean, unreal upkeep.

10:37.087 --> 10:39.317
You got maintenance,
you got supplies,

10:39.389 --> 10:41.619
docking fees,
these girls' salaries.

10:43.093 --> 10:44.583
The girls get big money?

10:44.695 --> 10:46.993
Well, relatively speaking,
they work pretty cheap,

10:47.064 --> 10:50.591
but see, Leeann
signed them to an
ironclad one-year contract,

10:50.667 --> 10:52.760
and whoever buys the boat
has to honor it.

10:54.938 --> 10:56.599
I'll take them.
I mean, it.

10:56.673 --> 10:59.073
$150,000,
20 down.

10:59.142 --> 11:02.305
Rick, I'm not
making offers here.
The boat's sold.

11:02.379 --> 11:04.279
Hey, the deal
isn't sewed up yet.

11:04.715 --> 11:06.706
You still owe me
three grand, remember.

11:06.783 --> 11:09.877
Well, then, give me
147 cash and it's yours.

11:11.555 --> 11:12.749
Thank you, sweetheart.

11:12.823 --> 11:13.847
Look.

11:13.924 --> 11:17.451
Rick, I really appreciate
what you're trying to do,
but it just won't work.

11:17.527 --> 11:22.396
I mean, you and me, well,
we're just not the right types
for this kind of life.

11:22.466 --> 11:23.524
You know what I mean?

11:23.600 --> 11:24.760
Why not?

11:24.835 --> 11:26.359
Well, let me put it
to you this way.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.996
On the one hand, you have
the kind of business mind

11:29.072 --> 11:31.734
that sees an opportunity
and takes the big risk.

11:31.942 --> 11:36.208
But he has that knack
for seeing his destiny
on the horizon,

11:36.680 --> 11:38.011
setting his course,

11:38.248 --> 11:40.478
never ever falling
asleep at the helm.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.642
You and me, we just
like to sleep too much.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.442
No.

11:45.222 --> 11:46.211
I'm...

11:49.159 --> 11:51.059
I am that kind of guy.

11:52.596 --> 11:54.723
I just never
had the chance to prove it.

11:57.334 --> 11:58.323
Okay.

11:58.935 --> 12:01.096
Okay, Rick.
Okay.

12:02.539 --> 12:04.803
Now, I'm going to
need 30 grand down
on this restaurant.

12:04.875 --> 12:07.002
Can you come up with 30
and $1,500 a month?

12:07.077 --> 12:08.374
I'll talk to the bank, Monday.

12:08.445 --> 12:09.742
Monday. See, Monday.

12:09.813 --> 12:13.840
Monday. See, you lose your
financing and I lose the
Maui deal and the boat.

12:14.518 --> 12:17.453
No, why don't we just
forget it. I can see you're
just way over your head.

12:17.521 --> 12:20.513
No. I'll have
the money tomorrow.

12:20.791 --> 12:22.520
I just have to talk to
a couple of investors.

12:22.592 --> 12:25.254
Investors? Magnum's not
going to put any money
in this boat.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.228
Not after the way
he walked off.

12:27.297 --> 12:29.390
I'm not talking about Thomas.

12:30.534 --> 12:31.762
Well, who then?

12:35.072 --> 12:36.198
Why me?

12:40.610 --> 12:42.669
And more to the point,
why you?

12:42.946 --> 12:44.675
You don't even like water.

12:45.248 --> 12:46.442
I like money.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.147
Everybody does.

12:48.218 --> 12:50.049
It's more to it
than that, Ice Pick.

12:50.120 --> 12:53.089
It's like
I'm seizing my opportunity.

12:53.757 --> 12:55.816
It's like taking
the big risk.

12:56.927 --> 12:59.862
You know, it's like I see
my destiny on the horizon.

12:59.930 --> 13:02.694
And I never, never
want to fall asleep
at the helm.

13:02.799 --> 13:06.633
Norman Vincent Peale?
Oh, Dale Carnegie?

13:06.703 --> 13:07.829
I don't know those guys.

13:07.904 --> 13:09.599
I want to go into business
with you.

13:09.673 --> 13:11.971
Twenty grand. I'll give you
a quarter interest.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.304
Not me.

13:14.044 --> 13:15.136
A third?

13:15.212 --> 13:16.406
No investment.

13:16.780 --> 13:20.807
But I'll make you a straight
simple interest loan.

13:21.551 --> 13:24.543
$20,000 at 25%.

13:25.922 --> 13:26.911
Okay.

13:27.157 --> 13:29.284
First payment,
next Friday.

13:29.392 --> 13:32.088
And you got to start dating
my daughter Hilda again.

13:34.798 --> 13:35.924
Anything.

13:38.735 --> 13:39.861
Ricky.

13:43.006 --> 13:45.497
You know,
I love you
like a son.

13:46.710 --> 13:48.507
I'd hate to have
to punish you.

14:05.796 --> 14:06.922
T. C: Ice Pick.

14:07.831 --> 14:11.232
Ice Pick?
You let yourself get
in hock to Ice Pick?

14:11.802 --> 14:14.999
T.C., can't you see
that I'm busy trying
to open for business?

14:15.505 --> 14:18.269
Business?
What business?
There's no one here.

14:18.341 --> 14:21.071
Well, there will be.
Mac and I closed the deal
late last night,

14:21.144 --> 14:22.509
and I just got here.

14:22.579 --> 14:23.568
And you know,

14:23.647 --> 14:26.844
it's too bad that you
didn't have the foresight
to get in on the action.

14:26.917 --> 14:30.250
Well, I guess that's
the story of my life.
Not enough foresight.

14:31.421 --> 14:35.255
Go ahead, make fun. But when
the word gets out, I'm gonna
be fighting them off.

14:35.692 --> 14:37.284
Well, looks like word got out.

14:39.696 --> 14:40.685
Oh.

14:41.832 --> 14:42.856
Girls.

14:42.933 --> 14:45.800
Girls, pop open
a bottle of champagne.
Our first customers are here.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.005
Yes, sir,
can I help you?

14:52.075 --> 14:53.337
This the <i>Miss Leeann?</i>

14:53.510 --> 14:57.446
You are now looking
at <i>The Wright Stuff.</i>
Rick Wright. I'm the owner.

14:58.415 --> 14:59.404
Uh-huh.

15:00.150 --> 15:03.813
You didn't happen to buy
this boat from a Jim Bonig?

15:03.920 --> 15:05.512
Uh-huh. Why?

15:07.123 --> 15:08.681
I've got a bill of sale.

15:08.758 --> 15:10.783
No, you've
got a problem.

15:11.294 --> 15:13.626
You were had, Captain.

15:15.398 --> 15:17.832
Homer Knowlton,
US Marshals Office.

15:18.068 --> 15:20.002
The <i>Miss Leeann</i>
is now impounded.

15:20.070 --> 15:23.506
She belongs to the
South Seas Travel Service,
out of Long Beach.

15:23.573 --> 15:26.804
Bonig rented her for 12 hours.
Forgot to bring her back.

15:27.410 --> 15:28.604
Everybody off the boat.

15:28.678 --> 15:29.975
Wait a minute.

15:30.046 --> 15:31.172
I'm sorry.

15:32.549 --> 15:33.743
Now, girls.

15:55.953 --> 15:58.979
<i>Returning once again</i>
<i>to the attributes of paradise,</i>

15:59.056 --> 16:02.651
<i>namely, it never goes away.</i>
<i>There's always another shot.</i>

16:02.927 --> 16:05.327
<i>Another shot</i>
<i>at that perfect day.</i>

16:10.368 --> 16:12.996
<i>Another shot at my</i>
<i>deep sea fishing trip,</i>

16:13.070 --> 16:17.973
<i>and this time I wasn't going</i>
<i>to let Rick or any of his</i>
<i>petty little problems stop me.</i>

16:20.878 --> 16:23.312
T. C: It's not that bad, Rick.
It's not worth it.

16:38.162 --> 16:41.290
Thomas, am I glad you're here.
Rick just tried to end it all.

16:41.365 --> 16:43.230
No, I didn't.
I slipped.

16:43.534 --> 16:45.399
Great. I'm going fishing.

16:45.736 --> 16:48.136
No, I'm not kidding, man.
He's in serious trouble.

16:48.205 --> 16:49.638
Sorry, I warned him.

16:49.707 --> 16:53.438
Hey, man, I'm talking about
trouble with a capital "T"
and that stands for Ice Pick.

16:53.511 --> 16:55.103
I thought they
were close.

16:55.179 --> 16:57.545
They were,
until Rick lost
20 grand of his

16:57.615 --> 16:59.446
and 10 grand of his own
to Mac.

16:59.750 --> 17:04.585
Mac? Now, how did...
I don't want to know. I just
want my day on the boat.

17:05.356 --> 17:07.881
No, man, I am serious.

17:07.958 --> 17:11.859
Mac left for San Francisco
with the bread and left Rick
here for shark bait.

17:11.929 --> 17:14.295
Now, how do you know Mac
went to San Francisco?

17:14.397 --> 17:17.127
Because I drove him
to the airport.

17:17.635 --> 17:20.126
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb!

17:20.204 --> 17:21.865
No! No!

17:21.939 --> 17:23.166
Dumb!

17:30.147 --> 17:31.614
Wait a second.

17:31.682 --> 17:33.013
Wait a second.

17:33.084 --> 17:36.247
You want me to go
to San Francisco
and get Mac back.

17:36.821 --> 17:39.483
Well, actually,
he has a little more
at stake than I do.

17:39.557 --> 17:42.492
I mean, I didn't make any
dumb investments.
Dumb investments?

17:43.294 --> 17:46.559
Please, Thomas.
I'm a dead person.

17:48.966 --> 17:52.561
Rick, if you're so busted,
how am I gonna get there?
I don't have the money.

17:56.073 --> 17:58.371
Okay, I'll spring
for airfare.

17:58.576 --> 17:59.770
And expenses?

18:03.180 --> 18:04.340
What are friends for?

18:04.415 --> 18:06.280
Great, I'll leave tonight,
after...

18:06.350 --> 18:08.614
Goodbye, Mr. Wong.
See you next time.

18:15.259 --> 18:18.524
On second thought,
why don't I just
leave right now?

18:27.805 --> 18:30.137
You ought to be proud
to have a friend like him.

18:30.207 --> 18:33.802
And you too, T.C.
You guys are the best buddies
that a person can have.

18:34.011 --> 18:35.478
I want to thank you.

18:36.347 --> 18:37.507
Of course,

18:38.349 --> 18:39.907
it ain't gonna
do any good.

18:40.117 --> 18:41.584
I'm gonna die anyway.

18:42.219 --> 18:44.517
Come on, cheer up, Rick.

18:45.055 --> 18:46.113
Could be worse.

18:46.190 --> 18:47.179
How?

18:47.291 --> 18:48.986
Rick-san,
we are ready.

18:51.328 --> 18:53.262
Rick-san, we are ready.

18:53.464 --> 18:56.331
Ready for what?
Go on home.

18:58.269 --> 19:01.670
Rick-san,
you are our home.

19:02.506 --> 19:06.374
Ladies, look,
the con is over.
Now, beat it.

19:06.677 --> 19:09.544
You are angry.
You wish a massage?

19:10.481 --> 19:12.108
I wish you
to get lost.

19:13.284 --> 19:14.615
Wait a minute.
I get it.

19:15.453 --> 19:17.683
Mac didn't pay
you off, right?

19:17.988 --> 19:20.786
Well, forget it,
'cause you're looking
at one broke guy, so...

19:20.858 --> 19:21.847
Pay?

19:22.660 --> 19:25.390
Rick-san,
you own us.
No pay.

19:26.297 --> 19:27.924
What are they
talking about?

19:28.532 --> 19:30.193
Bonig-san, old master.

19:30.734 --> 19:33.601
He say we on
permanent loan
to Rick-san.

19:35.005 --> 19:38.236
Oh, no.
T.C., you got to help me.

19:38.476 --> 19:39.465
I already helped you.

19:39.543 --> 19:42.671
I kicked in for airfare
and expenses so that Thomas
could get your money back.

19:42.746 --> 19:43.974
Now, I've got to split,

19:44.048 --> 19:46.346
go to my job,
and try to get some
of my money back.

19:46.417 --> 19:48.044
See you.
Wait a minute.

19:48.118 --> 19:49.915
What am I gonna do?
Do?

19:50.120 --> 19:51.314
T. C: Oh, do.

19:52.056 --> 19:53.353
I don't know.

19:53.424 --> 19:54.413
But...

19:54.825 --> 19:57.191
Look, Rick, you can come up
with something. I mean,

19:57.261 --> 19:59.821
you take three helpless,

19:59.897 --> 20:02.422
naive, misinformed
young ladies,

20:02.766 --> 20:06.133
who are being mistreated
by the cold, cruel world.

20:07.838 --> 20:10.864
Surely, there must
be a champion
for them somewhere.

20:16.413 --> 20:18.176
Oh, my God!

20:19.316 --> 20:21.546
Hi, Higgins.
Want a massage?

20:22.586 --> 20:24.417
What are you doing here?

20:25.990 --> 20:27.389
Who are these women?

20:28.926 --> 20:30.450
Where's Magnum?

20:32.997 --> 20:33.986
Magnum?

20:36.901 --> 20:37.993
Shh.

20:38.068 --> 20:41.367
Magnum,
come out here
immediately.

20:44.108 --> 20:45.473
Oh.

20:46.043 --> 20:47.772
Oh, oh.

20:53.851 --> 20:56.684
My sister
loves little room
that make rain.

20:59.657 --> 21:00.646
Quite.

21:01.759 --> 21:04.956
What the bloody blazes
is going on here?

21:05.563 --> 21:08.327
Higgins.
Sakiko, Tuzuei,

21:09.133 --> 21:11.363
and your friend
in the shower
is Tamiko.

21:11.936 --> 21:14.598
I have the great pleasure
of owning these chicks.

21:15.406 --> 21:17.670
You own them?
Mmm-hmm.

21:17.841 --> 21:20.139
I demand to know
Magnum's whereabouts.

21:20.210 --> 21:23.008
He went to find Mac,
who sold me
these here babes.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.605
You see, I thought
I was buying a boat,

21:25.783 --> 21:27.307
but Mac
went to Frisco and...

21:27.384 --> 21:28.942
Get out of here at once.

21:29.019 --> 21:30.077
Wait a minute, Higgins.

21:30.154 --> 21:33.055
Thomas told me that we could
stay here for a few days
once you heard the problem.

21:33.123 --> 21:34.988
Problem? Problem?
What problem?

21:35.059 --> 21:39.291
I just don't have
enough room at home
for all of my slaves.

21:39.797 --> 21:43.528
I am disgusted and ashamed
as a Western man at your lack
of moral character.

21:43.801 --> 21:47.362
How dare you, as a civilized
man, presume to...

21:47.438 --> 21:50.373
To own their services?
Stop that. Get out now.

21:53.210 --> 21:54.905
I guess you won't be
wanting that massage.

21:54.979 --> 21:55.968
Out.

21:56.046 --> 21:58.537
All right.
But then where, Higgins?

21:58.916 --> 22:00.076
Immigration?

22:00.184 --> 22:01.651
What about immigration?

22:01.785 --> 22:05.016
Exactly what I said.
These girls are illegals.

22:05.389 --> 22:07.914
Which means that
they'll be sent back
to their former owner.

22:08.258 --> 22:10.988
But if that's
the way you want it...

22:14.598 --> 22:15.929
Tamiko.

22:17.901 --> 22:20.131
When did you say
Magnum would be back?

22:20.204 --> 22:23.503
He better be back tomorrow
or none of it's gonna
make any difference.

22:24.408 --> 22:25.397
Well,

22:26.543 --> 22:27.942
if there's no chance
of them staying here,

22:28.012 --> 22:30.003
I guess I'll just have to
make room upstairs for them

22:30.080 --> 22:31.274
in the club
or something.

22:31.348 --> 22:33.339
Well, of course,
I can't allow that.

22:41.291 --> 22:44.522
Well, I suppose they can
stay here for the time being.

22:44.895 --> 22:49.298
Hopefully, my fluency in
Japanese will facilitate
a rapid deprogramming.

22:50.300 --> 22:53.736
And then I shall begin their
enlightenment as to Western
democratic philosophies

22:53.804 --> 22:55.396
regarding human rights.

22:55.472 --> 22:57.497
Until Magnum
brings back Mac.
Precisely.

22:57.574 --> 22:59.906
It please you that we
stay here, Rick-san?

23:00.144 --> 23:03.272
Sakiko, you don't have
to please me anymore.

23:04.682 --> 23:06.445
Higgins-san
is your master now.

23:06.517 --> 23:08.485
They do not have a master.

23:15.859 --> 23:17.053
Sakiko-san...

23:35.446 --> 23:38.040
Boy, you sure got
a way with words.

23:43.721 --> 23:46.690
T.C., I want a shower

23:46.757 --> 23:48.725
and something to eat
beside lemons.

23:49.526 --> 23:52.825
Plus, I've only had
three hours sleep
in an airport lounge.

23:52.896 --> 23:56.059
What's wrong with the hotel
I got you? The Bridgeside Inn?

23:56.133 --> 23:58.499
There's no Bridgeside Inn
in San Francisco.

23:58.669 --> 24:00.660
Of course not.
It's in Salinas.

24:00.738 --> 24:03.400
Never mind that.
Sleep is sleep.
Death is forever.

24:03.474 --> 24:05.669
Did you find Mac?
- <i>No.</i>

24:05.743 --> 24:07.301
That's it.
I'm in the archives.

24:07.377 --> 24:11.006
Rick, you're not in
the archives. I traced Mac
to a podiatrist's office.

24:11.081 --> 24:13.208
He just skipped to Tahoe
before I could nab him.

24:13.283 --> 24:14.648
<i>Go to Tahoe.</i>

24:18.722 --> 24:21.919
I guess you better
book me a car to Tahoe.

24:22.292 --> 24:25.489
Ultra-luxury, luxury, economy,

24:25.562 --> 24:29.293
demi-economy, compact,
sub-compact

24:29.366 --> 24:31.493
or our cut-rate special?

24:31.568 --> 24:32.830
Cut-rate special.

24:33.303 --> 24:36.534
I would have figured you
for at least the demi-economy.

24:36.774 --> 24:37.866
Lemon?

24:42.179 --> 24:44.647
Got some paying customers
coming to the office.

24:44.982 --> 24:46.950
Moonlight in Maui.

24:47.251 --> 24:48.548
See you later.

24:52.089 --> 24:54.284
Bye.
Yeah, bye.

25:29.059 --> 25:33.826
Judging from your telephone
conversation, we have
something in common.

25:35.098 --> 25:39.034
You see, I, too, have
much to discuss with
the man you call Mac.

25:40.137 --> 25:41.229
Who are you?

25:42.706 --> 25:43.900
What do you want?

25:43.974 --> 25:46.602
You have received some
stolen goods from James Bonig.

25:46.944 --> 25:48.536
Property of my Uncle Kanki.

25:48.946 --> 25:50.140
Three young ladies.

25:50.214 --> 25:51.806
I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:59.923 --> 26:03.950
This is Yakira. For many years
he was a master chef in Tokyo.

26:04.228 --> 26:06.594
At what I believe you call
a Japanese steak house?

26:11.435 --> 26:12.834
Where are the girls?

26:13.470 --> 26:15.836
What makes you think Mac
left the broads with me?

26:15.906 --> 26:19.205
Well, you see, Mac left us
in somewhat of a hurry.

26:19.509 --> 26:21.534
He even forgot his clothes.

26:22.379 --> 26:23.676
Oh, and this.

26:24.982 --> 26:26.244
"Congratulations.

26:26.316 --> 26:29.808
"You have won dinner for two
at Honolulu's famed
King Kamehameha Club.

26:29.887 --> 26:32.287
"Courtesy of
Orville Wright, Manager."

27:17.505 --> 27:18.494
Stop.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.098
Stop this instant, please.

27:22.270 --> 27:24.170
Leave this room, now.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.801
The rain is falling
for you, Higgins-san.

27:27.875 --> 27:30.241
I am ready to wash your back.
- No.

27:30.311 --> 27:35.681
Sakiko, in America, in most
all of Western civilization,
we have a curious tradition.

27:35.750 --> 27:36.978
We bathe alone.

27:37.051 --> 27:38.746
Then how you
wash your back?

27:38.886 --> 27:40.717
Sakiko, please.

27:41.255 --> 27:43.689
Take your sisters away
and wait for me in the study.

27:43.758 --> 27:46.158
We will begin
our lesson shortly.

27:46.327 --> 27:47.954
You are unhappy.

27:48.229 --> 27:50.527
It is a dishonor
not to please master.

27:50.598 --> 27:52.566
But I am not your master.

27:52.767 --> 27:57.261
You are your own master and
you may do anything you wish.
Do you understand?

28:06.714 --> 28:08.181
We understand.

28:08.249 --> 28:09.375
Splendid.

28:09.450 --> 28:14.080
Higgins-san, would you like
your breakfast before little
room of rain or after?

28:20.895 --> 28:23.955
Yes, operator,
person to person. Collect.

28:24.932 --> 28:27.696
Yes, that's right,
Theodore Calvin.

28:28.603 --> 28:31.003
Who? Oh, who. This is...

28:31.672 --> 28:34.106
Hello, Dad? Yeah, I've been
meaning to call you, but I...

28:34.175 --> 28:35.164
Hi, T.C.

28:35.910 --> 28:37.275
T. C: <i>Magnum, where are you?</i>

28:37.412 --> 28:38.401
Tahoe.

28:38.479 --> 28:39.571
Did you find Mac?

28:39.647 --> 28:41.114
<i>No, I didn't find Mac</i>
<i>and I'm afraid</i>

28:41.182 --> 28:45.380
Rick has just run out of luck.
He's gonna have to go
to Ice Pick and explain.

28:45.453 --> 28:47.318
I mean, I am not
going to run around

28:47.388 --> 28:50.551
from airport to airport,
tracking down leads,

28:50.625 --> 28:52.786
renting cars,
borrowing phones.

28:52.860 --> 28:53.849
<i>You've got to.</i>

28:54.462 --> 28:56.396
Why? Give me one
good reason why.

28:57.665 --> 28:59.599
Because it's more
than Ice Pick.

29:01.102 --> 29:02.660
Rick's in real trouble now.

29:02.737 --> 29:04.534
With who,
his daughter Hilda?

29:05.206 --> 29:06.969
Worse. Yakuza.

29:08.943 --> 29:11.309
They roughed him up
real bad last night
looking for the girls.

29:12.480 --> 29:13.504
Is he okay?

29:13.581 --> 29:15.549
<i>Yeah, after about</i>
<i>three hours in emergency.</i>

29:15.883 --> 29:18.078
But those chumps are gonna
try to jack him up again,

29:18.152 --> 29:20.780
so you've got to try to find
Mac and straighten things out.

29:22.390 --> 29:25.553
Well, Mac did stop here
briefly to see
a ski instructor,

29:25.626 --> 29:27.389
but she said he went
to Long Beach.

29:27.495 --> 29:30.987
Long Beach? Say, maybe there
really is a lady named Leeann.

29:31.065 --> 29:32.259
<i>You've got to find Mac.</i>

29:32.333 --> 29:34.699
Well, I'll try.
Could you send me some...

29:39.607 --> 29:40.596
Linda,

29:41.776 --> 29:44.244
could you book me a car,
Long Beach?

29:44.312 --> 29:47.213
Ultra-luxury, luxury, economy,

29:47.281 --> 29:50.842
demi-economy, compact,
sub-compact

29:50.918 --> 29:52.613
or the cut-rate special?

29:55.189 --> 29:57.123
I'll have the demi-economy.

29:57.458 --> 29:58.789
You sure?

29:58.860 --> 30:01.226
Yeah. Demi-economy.

30:01.295 --> 30:03.286
Okay.
It's up to you.

30:04.165 --> 30:07.623
Frankly, you could have
gotten the same car
with the cut-rate special.

30:09.704 --> 30:10.830
Lemon?

30:11.572 --> 30:14.097
<i>No man</i>
<i>may possess you,</i>

30:15.209 --> 30:18.667
and no man has the right

30:18.913 --> 30:21.143
to deny you
freedom of choice.

30:22.416 --> 30:27.376
This was first guaranteed by
the Magna Carta in 1215 and...

30:27.455 --> 30:28.945
Please, Higgins-san.

30:29.957 --> 30:32.221
Your sisters are
not following
the English text?

30:32.293 --> 30:35.490
Oh, no, they understand words
but not the meaning.

30:35.863 --> 30:38.229
If we are free
to make our own choices,

30:38.799 --> 30:41.700
then why do you say
we are not free to
serve our master?

30:42.837 --> 30:45.397
Sakiko, it rather defeats
the purpose of freedom

30:45.473 --> 30:48.601
if one freely chooses
to be enslaved.

30:49.710 --> 30:54.147
In your free West,
it is good to dishonor
one's father?

30:54.215 --> 30:57.184
Certainly not.
Why do you ask?

30:57.785 --> 31:01.016
When we were young,
Kanki, great man of Tokyo,

31:01.088 --> 31:03.989
saved our father's honor
by giving him land and money.

31:04.292 --> 31:08.319
As payment, he take
three girl children,
be our master.

31:08.829 --> 31:10.160
Good, yes?

31:11.332 --> 31:13.994
You happy with
the arrangement?

31:15.136 --> 31:17.934
It is great honor
to serve owner
who is Yakuza.

31:18.406 --> 31:21.466
And it is happiness
to honor dead father's wishes.

31:22.209 --> 31:24.837
If we now say
we are not owned,

31:24.912 --> 31:26.641
it is saying
that he did wrong.

31:28.416 --> 31:31.852
Your father did do you
a disservice, Sakiko.
I'm sorry.

31:31.919 --> 31:34.786
I'm sure he saw no harm
in the transaction, but...

31:38.726 --> 31:40.091
Excuse me.

31:48.202 --> 31:49.965
Zeus, Apollo, stay.

31:51.906 --> 31:53.840
I demand to know
what you're doing here.

31:53.908 --> 31:56.741
I was most emphatic
in asking you not to...

31:57.445 --> 31:59.174
My God,
what on earth happened?

31:59.246 --> 32:02.272
A couple of master chefs
tried to stir-fry my fingers.

32:02.350 --> 32:04.477
Yakuza, no doubt.
- How'd you know?

32:05.453 --> 32:06.750
Well,
they're after the girls,

32:06.821 --> 32:08.721
so we thought
we better get over here
and check things out.

32:08.789 --> 32:11.622
I assure you they'll be
quite safe here with me
and the lads.

32:11.692 --> 32:13.990
Yeah, well, the guy
that Mac stole them
from in Tokyo is...

32:14.061 --> 32:16.928
Yes, Kanki.
Evidently he's very powerful
and feared.

32:17.031 --> 32:19.556
That's great.
That is just great.

32:19.634 --> 32:22.501
Thomas goes halfway
across the mainland
tracing Mac,

32:22.570 --> 32:25.403
and by the time he gets back
it's not gonna
mean anything anyway.

32:25.473 --> 32:27.998
Higgins-san?
Please forgive.

32:28.376 --> 32:31.004
We would like to hear
more Western freedom lesson,

32:31.078 --> 32:32.909
if you would honor us
as teacher.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.776
Yes. Yes,
very good, Sakiko.

32:35.850 --> 32:38.410
Go and review your material
on the Magna Carta.

32:38.753 --> 32:40.618
T. C: The Magna Carta?

32:40.921 --> 32:43.219
Why are you telling them
that stuff, Higgins?

32:43.290 --> 32:46.589
Why don't you tell them about
the Emancipation Proclamation,

32:46.661 --> 32:48.185
the Declaration
of Independence?

32:48.262 --> 32:51.129
One must begin
with the origins
of democratic principle.

32:51.198 --> 32:53.098
Those documents are simply
ambiguous restatements

32:53.167 --> 32:54.862
of the Magna Carta philosophy.

32:54.935 --> 32:56.129
In your opinion.

32:56.203 --> 32:57.932
And my opinion is
the only one that matters
in this instant.

32:59.106 --> 33:01.336
Now, please go before
you bring them down
on the very ones

33:01.409 --> 33:02.569
you want to protect.

33:02.643 --> 33:04.304
- Go.
- Higgins-san?

33:04.412 --> 33:06.107
Please do not be offended.

33:06.247 --> 33:09.648
But if Western freedom
such a wonderful thing,

33:10.317 --> 33:13.013
then why you get mad
at each other about it?

33:23.397 --> 33:25.126
T. C: The Magna Carta.

33:25.466 --> 33:27.730
I bet you he tells them
he was there at the signing.

33:27.802 --> 33:29.827
Look, get me downtown,
will you?

33:29.904 --> 33:31.769
I got to see Ice Pick
and I got to see him fast.

33:31.939 --> 33:35.238
Ice Pick? Asian hoods
aren't enough for you?

33:35.309 --> 33:38.107
Will you cut it out?
I told you before,
Ice Pick's not a problem.

33:38.179 --> 33:41.671
As a matter of fact,
I'm gonna ask him to
protect me from the Yakuza.

33:41.749 --> 33:44.741
He will.
I mean a lot
to that old guy.

33:47.221 --> 33:48.882
He's a lot like my dad.

33:51.592 --> 33:52.820
Hi.
- Hi.

33:53.127 --> 33:55.595
Donny, right?
No, Thomas.

33:56.197 --> 33:59.257
Thomas? Well,
that's nice. Strong.

33:59.333 --> 34:02.860
It's not intimidating.
I like it. Come in.

34:04.805 --> 34:07.296
I'm looking for Leeann.

34:07.374 --> 34:09.239
Well, you've got her.

34:13.514 --> 34:16.005
You can change up there
while I put on your tapes.

34:16.083 --> 34:18.074
What do you use,
audio or video?

34:19.253 --> 34:21.312
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

34:22.089 --> 34:24.853
You mean you're not Donny,
the aerobics instructor

34:24.925 --> 34:26.483
who's come to
work on my legs?

34:26.560 --> 34:28.118
No, my name's Thomas.

34:28.496 --> 34:31.795
If you leave quietly,
I won't have to
call the police.

34:31.966 --> 34:34.366
You don't understand.

34:34.601 --> 34:38.299
I do understand that you came
in here trying to impersonate
an aerobics instructor.

34:38.371 --> 34:42.831
I'm not impersonating
anybody. I'm a friend
of a friend of yours.

34:42.909 --> 34:45.174
Who?
Jim Bonig.

34:45.513 --> 34:47.344
I don't know
any Jim Bonig.

34:49.083 --> 34:50.380
Neville Thompson?

34:52.152 --> 34:53.210
Joe Travis?

34:53.286 --> 34:55.118
I'm gonna give you
until a count of three.

34:55.188 --> 34:56.382
I call him Mac.

34:56.456 --> 34:59.426
One...
No, you have to know him,
he's about this tall.

34:59.560 --> 35:01.460
...two...
He's got an impish smile.

35:01.529 --> 35:03.326
He said you gave him a boat.

35:04.865 --> 35:07.425
Eddie?
Yeah, Eddie!

35:08.602 --> 35:13.039
Why didn't you say so?
Well, come in. Sit down.

35:13.607 --> 35:16.007
Yeah, he was just here.
Oh, he was?

35:16.076 --> 35:19.568
Uh, do you know where he went?
It's very important that
I get in touch with him.

35:19.647 --> 35:22.810
Yeah. Yeah, he was trying
to outrun this guy.

35:22.983 --> 35:24.678
You're not gonna
believe this.

35:24.752 --> 35:28.153
This guy, this
supposed friend of his...

35:28.255 --> 35:32.749
What did he call him?
It was like a gun.
Uh, Derringer or something.

35:33.460 --> 35:37.726
Anyway, poor Eddie brings
these three orphan girls
over to Hawaii from Japan

35:37.798 --> 35:40.699
where he tries
to get them adopted.
And this guy...

35:40.768 --> 35:43.999
I wish I could
remember his name.
It wasn't Winchester...

35:44.071 --> 35:45.060
Magnum.

35:46.073 --> 35:50.237
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
Why, do you know him?

35:50.411 --> 35:52.436
Well, yeah, sort of.

35:52.513 --> 35:56.415
Well, anyway, this creep,
Magnum, he tries to get
these girls deported.

35:56.483 --> 35:58.212
Just because
he's jealous of Eddie.

35:58.285 --> 36:00.480
Jealous of Eddie?
Yeah.

36:00.554 --> 36:02.249
Well, it happens
all the time.

36:02.857 --> 36:04.984
Anyway, so he had
to have the boat

36:05.059 --> 36:07.289
to prove that he was
this upstanding citizen

36:07.361 --> 36:10.330
and was able to take care
of these girls until he
could get them adopted.

36:10.397 --> 36:11.728
So, you gave it to him.

36:11.799 --> 36:14.996
Yeah. Well, he
paid me almost half
of what it was worth.

36:15.836 --> 36:18.805
Anyway, if you want to
find him, you'll have to
go to Hawaii.

36:19.139 --> 36:20.697
You see, there was this,

36:21.108 --> 36:24.475
this other
little misunderstanding.

36:25.179 --> 36:27.340
You see, the Marshals
have the boat.

36:27.414 --> 36:29.678
Yeah, but I called them
and they're gonna
hand it over to him.

36:29.750 --> 36:31.877
Hmm. Hawaii.

36:35.289 --> 36:37.780
Well, wait.
Where are you going?

36:39.693 --> 36:40.682
Hawaii.

36:42.129 --> 36:44.859
Does this mean that
you're not going
to work on my legs?

36:44.932 --> 36:46.763
<i>I gotta break</i>
<i>both your legs.</i>

36:47.001 --> 36:49.492
Oh, but nice clean breaks.

36:49.570 --> 36:51.128
But you know my boys.

36:51.572 --> 36:52.800
They're experts.

36:53.941 --> 36:56.501
Ice Pick, I told you,
Thomas will get
your cash back.

36:57.311 --> 36:59.506
Right now,
I need your protection.

36:59.580 --> 37:01.707
Right now,
you need 25 G's.

37:01.782 --> 37:05.616
I thought we sort of had
a father-and-son relationship.

37:07.421 --> 37:08.820
I even took Hilda out.

37:08.889 --> 37:11.790
That's another thing.
She said you got fresh.

37:11.859 --> 37:14.828
Ice Pick, I swear I wasn't.
I wouldn't touch her.
She's a...

37:14.895 --> 37:16.385
I want the whole thing.

37:16.463 --> 37:18.158
It's an unprotected loan.

37:18.265 --> 37:20.392
You get it by Friday,
no problem!

37:20.567 --> 37:21.932
You don't...

37:23.737 --> 37:25.898
Now, wait a minute...
You wait a minute.

37:25.973 --> 37:27.668
I gave you
what you asked for.

37:27.741 --> 37:29.732
You let me down.
Now, that hurts.

37:32.513 --> 37:35.038
Rick, I can't show
any favoritism.

37:35.249 --> 37:36.773
It's bad for business.

37:38.118 --> 37:41.144
Don't worry,
I'll pick up
the hospital bills.

37:42.589 --> 37:45.922
Yeah, well what about
my airfare? Where?

37:45.993 --> 37:47.688
Where? Home.
I want to go home.

37:47.761 --> 37:49.752
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>I'll put it on T.C. 's card.</i>

37:49.830 --> 37:52.321
What I want to know is,
did you find Mac?

37:52.399 --> 37:55.129
No. But I found Leeann.

37:55.202 --> 37:58.000
She's not gonna save me
from Ice Pick
and the Yakuza.

37:58.072 --> 37:59.903
Maybe she is.
<i>How, how?</i>

37:59.974 --> 38:02.704
Look, calm down, Rick.
I think your troubles
are over.

38:02.776 --> 38:05.336
My life is over.
No, it's not.

38:05.412 --> 38:08.939
Mac was here. He saw Leeann.
And he bought the <i>Miss Leeann</i>
back from her.

38:09.016 --> 38:10.779
With Ice Pick's and my money.

38:10.851 --> 38:13.513
But don't you see,
that means he's coming
back for the boat.

38:13.587 --> 38:16.818
See, Leeann called
the Marshals' office,
she dropped the charges,

38:16.890 --> 38:19.825
and then she gave them
permission to release the boat
to Mac when he gets in.

38:19.893 --> 38:23.226
Well, then that means
that Mac's also coming
back for the girls.

38:23.297 --> 38:26.664
Hopefully.
Thank God.
I got a shot at living.

38:27.134 --> 38:29.432
I'm gonna kill him. Bye.

38:34.942 --> 38:38.105
$69.95 for a demi-economy?

38:38.178 --> 38:40.976
Yes, but that includes
gas, mileage,

38:41.048 --> 38:44.074
a stereo cassette player and
a free Julio Iglesias tape.

38:44.151 --> 38:48.110
Yeah, but the other girl said
you get the same thing
with the cut-rate special.

38:48.188 --> 38:51.385
Oh, but with the
cut-rate special you don't
get the stereo cassette player

38:51.458 --> 38:53.483
and the free
Julio Iglesias tape.

38:53.861 --> 38:55.021
Oh.

38:55.195 --> 38:57.095
Don't forget
your lemon, sir.

39:24.058 --> 39:25.787
I bet he won't
even let us in.

39:25.859 --> 39:27.258
He's got to.

39:27.327 --> 39:29.818
Mac's gotta come here
looking for the girls,
and when he does,

39:29.897 --> 39:31.455
that's when we nab him.

39:31.532 --> 39:33.397
Yeah, but even if
you get the boat back,

39:33.467 --> 39:35.628
how will you pay
Ice Pick by Friday?

39:36.737 --> 39:40.264
That's what I'm hoping that
Higgins'll let me talk
to Robin Masters about.

39:41.442 --> 39:42.875
Dream on.

39:43.177 --> 39:44.667
<i>Quite.</i>

39:56.824 --> 39:59.224
What is going on?
How dare...

39:59.993 --> 40:02.018
Please don't be alarmed,
Mr. Higgins.

40:02.296 --> 40:04.958
We're friends of Rick's.
Nagosho, remember?

40:05.265 --> 40:07.756
And,
of course, you...
Yeah, Yakira. I know.

40:07.835 --> 40:10.099
Higgins, don't reach
for the phone.

40:10.237 --> 40:13.263
We're quite positive
that our girls
hide on this estate.

40:14.775 --> 40:15.764
Please.

40:16.110 --> 40:18.408
Save us the trouble
of searching for them.

40:53.177 --> 40:57.011
I have never seen
such a craven display of
cowardice in my entire life.

40:57.081 --> 40:58.742
He wasn't going to slice
and dice your fingers.

40:58.816 --> 41:01.148
What are a few digits
compared to one's honor

41:01.219 --> 41:03.346
and the safety of
three helpless girls?

41:03.421 --> 41:04.410
And Mac.

41:04.489 --> 41:08.016
Besides, we don't know
for sure that he was
taking them to the boat.

41:08.092 --> 41:11.550
Well, anyway, that's probably
the first place
they're gonna look for them.

41:11.662 --> 41:13.823
Nevertheless...

41:17.401 --> 41:19.460
What's that?
A ringing telephone.

41:19.537 --> 41:21.471
I know that.
They cut the lines.

41:21.539 --> 41:23.769
There are no lines
on a cordless.

41:23.841 --> 41:26.708
That's great.
We're in no position
to answer it anyway.

41:26.778 --> 41:30.373
No, not us.
Zeus, Apollo, phone!

41:38.189 --> 41:39.747
<i>Higgins, Higgins?</i>

41:39.824 --> 41:41.849
Yes, Magnum.
Are you back?

41:41.926 --> 41:46.329
Well, that's all relative,
Higgins. I'm just half
back. I'm at the airport.

41:46.397 --> 41:49.025
The same airport where
Rick and T.C. Were
supposed to pick me up.

41:49.100 --> 41:50.658
They can't.
They're indisposed.

41:50.735 --> 41:53.067
You might say
they're tied up at the moment.

41:53.137 --> 41:55.332
<i>Well, so am I,</i>
<i>doing Rick's favors.</i>

41:55.406 --> 41:57.101
Well, I'm afraid you're going
to have to do one more.

41:57.175 --> 41:58.506
To make a long story short,

41:58.576 --> 42:01.704
<i>Mac and the three girls</i>
<i>are probably at this moment</i>
<i>at the</i> Miss Leeann.

42:01.813 --> 42:03.713
Good. They can have it.

42:03.781 --> 42:05.305
And Rick can go
get Mac himself.

42:05.383 --> 42:08.648
He would if he could.
You see, Magnum,
we're all tied up

42:08.719 --> 42:12.086
by those two Yakuza chaps,
who at this moment are on
their way to the <i>Miss Leeann</i>

42:12.156 --> 42:14.249
to kidnap
those three homeless waifs.

42:14.325 --> 42:16.190
<i>Magnum, you must</i>
<i>go there and stop them.</i>

42:16.260 --> 42:18.888
Well, yeah, but...
You must. We'll be there
as soon as possible.

42:18.963 --> 42:20.988
As soon as Zeus
unties my bonds.

42:21.065 --> 42:22.555
<i>Meanwhile, you must save them.</i>

42:22.633 --> 42:26.933
But, Higgins,
I don't have a car,
I don't have a gun.

42:28.206 --> 42:29.468
Higgins.

42:32.443 --> 42:34.138
Oh, lemon, sir?

42:35.112 --> 42:36.101
Yes.

42:39.817 --> 42:43.514
<i>One of the other</i>
<i>attributes of paradise</i>
<i>is that it's home.</i>

42:43.588 --> 42:47.183
<i>I mean, there's nothing wrong</i>
<i>with San Francisco or</i>
<i>Lake Tahoe or Long Beach.</i>

42:47.258 --> 42:51.354
<i>All nice places.</i>
<i>But, after all,</i>
<i>there's no place like home.</i>

42:52.463 --> 42:54.397
<i>Except at moments like these.</i>

42:54.465 --> 42:57.866
<i>Long Beach,</i>
<i>Tahoe and San Francisco</i>
<i>seem a heck of a lot safer.</i>

43:01.138 --> 43:03.265
Sakiko, take
your sisters away.

43:07.712 --> 43:09.077
Sakiko, now.

43:09.146 --> 43:10.875
Or you will be punished.

43:13.885 --> 43:16.376
Better do what he says,
sweetheart. I'll be okay.

43:17.021 --> 43:18.215
Magna Carta!

43:40.044 --> 43:41.272
Get him, Mac!

43:41.612 --> 43:42.840
Right.

43:44.815 --> 43:46.043
Mac!

44:24.755 --> 44:26.882
Nice work, girls.
- Thanks.

44:26.958 --> 44:29.188
When Abraham Lincoln
sign Magna Carta,

44:29.260 --> 44:31.057
he make
girl children free.

44:31.128 --> 44:35.656
You tell Kanki we stay here
in free West,
work on our boat.

44:36.233 --> 44:39.225
Because you, dear chap,
are trespassing.

44:49.480 --> 44:53.246
Hey, Thomas, I found him
doing the dog paddle
down the dock.

44:53.317 --> 44:55.046
Boy, am I glad
you guys showed up.

44:55.119 --> 44:56.848
I was just on my way
to call the cops.

44:56.921 --> 44:58.752
In the water?
Where's my money?

44:58.823 --> 44:59.915
Uh, Rick...
Money?

44:59.991 --> 45:02.983
Yeah. Because of you,
my credit card has been
strained to the limit.

45:03.060 --> 45:05.551
As is my patience.
Talk, Mac.

45:05.629 --> 45:06.687
Okay, okay.

45:06.764 --> 45:10.325
How dare you sell Rick
these poor, defenseless girls?

45:10.868 --> 45:13.166
Sell them?
Come on.

45:13.237 --> 45:15.068
What kind of a sleaze
do you think I am?

45:15.139 --> 45:16.697
Is this multiple choice?

45:16.774 --> 45:20.369
Guys, guys, guys.
Look, the whole truth
of the matter is that

45:20.444 --> 45:23.743
I sneaked these girls
away from this big
Yakuza guy in Tokyo.

45:23.814 --> 45:26.146
I mean, after all,
I've known them
since they were little kids.

45:26.217 --> 45:28.708
What kind of a life
was it gonna be anyway
for these girls?

45:28.786 --> 45:30.651
I mean, later on,
slaves to gangsters...

45:30.721 --> 45:32.746
How utterly
altruistic of you.

45:32.823 --> 45:34.120
Get to the money part.

45:34.191 --> 45:36.421
Well, I wanted
to get these girls
their freedom.

45:36.494 --> 45:39.725
But, once I found out
that Kanki's boys
were after me, well,

45:39.797 --> 45:42.595
I figured the only safe
thing to do would be to
leave the girls with you all

45:42.666 --> 45:45.897
while I went out
and tried to get back
the <i>Miss Leeann</i> from Leeann.

45:45.970 --> 45:48.700
With my money.
And Ice Pick's.

45:48.773 --> 45:50.035
Oh, don't remind me.

45:50.107 --> 45:53.770
Figuring that once
I did that, the girls
would have their job,

45:53.844 --> 45:56.108
you could get your
investment back,
I could make a buck or two

45:56.180 --> 45:58.444
and everybody would
live happily ever after.

45:59.417 --> 46:03.217
And you didn't tell me you
were gonna go into hock to Ice
Pick. That wasn't very bright.

46:03.287 --> 46:05.983
Anyway, now that
everything's resolved,
she's all yours.

46:06.057 --> 46:08.617
And you can
get your money back
and pay off Ice Pick.

46:08.826 --> 46:10.760
And me.
And you.

46:10.995 --> 46:13.225
And me.
And you.

46:13.464 --> 46:14.522
And them?

46:14.598 --> 46:16.589
Well, they're gonna
work on the boat.

46:16.667 --> 46:20.433
I mean, I figure as
long as they got jobs,
immigration's no problem.

46:20.671 --> 46:24.505
And me, well,
I just figured
I'd be moseying along.

46:24.575 --> 46:25.599
Mac.

46:26.877 --> 46:28.572
Mac, why?

46:28.879 --> 46:32.474
I mean, why did you try
to pull something
so dangerous?

46:32.550 --> 46:34.415
So big? Why?

46:34.785 --> 46:37.253
Magnum, I'm glad
you asked me
that question.

46:39.990 --> 46:41.821
You know, I really
don't know why.

46:41.992 --> 46:46.395
Unless it's because,
well, maybe I just want
to be the kind of guy

46:46.764 --> 46:49.733
that sees the opportunity
and takes that big risk.

46:49.834 --> 46:51.096
The kind of guy that...

46:51.168 --> 46:52.396
Hey, Mr. Wong!

46:52.470 --> 46:54.836
How you doing, buddy?
Sees his destiny
on the horizon,

46:54.905 --> 46:57.032
sets his course,
and never, ever,

46:57.108 --> 47:00.009
ever falls asleep
at the helm.

47:25.836 --> 47:27.633
An opportunity
you won't be able to pass up.

47:27.705 --> 47:30.173
Now, come on, come on.
Couldn't we make
a deal or something?
