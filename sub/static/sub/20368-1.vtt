[Heather] <i>You were omniscient</i>

00:39.205 --> 00:43.668
<i>And, you've literally just</i>

00:45.754 --> 00:47.630
<i>And, sometimes you would</i>
<i>watch</i> <i>them for days </i>

00:47.714 --> 00:48.923
<i>and then you'd </i>
<i>have intel that...</i>

00:49.424 --> 00:51.718
<i>That this guy is a bad guy.</i>

00:52.135 --> 00:55.346
<i>And, you wait till he walks</i>
<i>out to the</i> <i>field to meet with</i>
<i>some friends for something, </i>

00:55.430 --> 00:56.806
<i>and you'd blow him up.</i>

00:59.434 --> 01:01.019

[Heather] <i> I originally was</i>
<i>interested in Navy at first,</i>

01:34.969 --> 01:37.514
<i>because the guy </i>
<i>that I was dating </i>
<i>had been in the Navy,</i>

01:37.597 --> 01:39.849
<i>and I was like,</i>
<i>"Oh, maybe I'll just </i>
<i>join the Navy",</i>

01:40.266 --> 01:43.353
<i>you know, travel, </i>
<i>and see the world, </i>
<i>and fight for my country</i>

01:43.436 --> 01:46.356
<i>and protect people</i>
<i>from terrorists.</i>

01:46.439 --> 01:49.943
<i>And, I ended up being</i>
<i>recruited into the Air Force </i>

01:50.026 --> 01:52.654
<i>because I actually saw </i>
<i>the posters with the drones,</i>

01:52.779 --> 01:56.574
and, I was like,
"Wow, that is so cool",
like unmanned aircraft.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.409
Like, that's really badass.

01:59.035 --> 02:03.706
<i>And I was still like, </i>
<i>under the impression that </i>
<i>America was saving the world.</i>

02:04.457 --> 02:08.336
<i>Like, that we were </i>
<i>Big Brother, and we were </i>
<i>helping everyone out.</i>

02:09.586 --> 02:11.589
<i>So, when I saw </i>
<i>this possibility</i>

02:11.673 --> 02:13.800
<i>that I could get out of like,</i>
<i>this small town that I was in,</i>

02:13.883 --> 02:17.220
<i>get out of Pennsylvania,</i>
<i>and just travel,</i>

02:17.303 --> 02:19.264
<i>and I thought that was</i>
<i>the only way to do it.</i>

02:19.514 --> 02:22.684
And, they didn't make it seem
like you would be that,

02:22.767 --> 02:24.978

[Heather] <i> I was </i>
<i>in the military prior to </i>
<i>being in massage school.</i>

02:59.053 --> 03:00.346
I got out two years ago.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.265
I was in
Air Force Intelligence,

03:02.348 --> 03:04.058
I flew the drones.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.394
I was part of a unit that...

03:06.769 --> 03:08.897
we fought in Afghanistan,

03:09.230 --> 03:12.150
and I've lost friends
to the war.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.445
I've lost friends to suicide
that were a part of that unit.

03:16.195 --> 03:20.241
And, I've seen a lot
of people die...

03:20.700 --> 03:21.534
in the war.

03:21.826 --> 03:25.788
So, for me, I brought
to the massage table pain,

03:26.080 --> 03:28.833
and just absolute despair.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.711
And, memories, like...
horrible memories.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.090
And, along with that
is an anxiety disorder
and a sleep disorder.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.634
And, I thought...

03:38.301 --> 03:41.596
you know, I came here,
I think, subconsciously
looking for healing

03:41.804 --> 03:42.805
<i>for myself.</i>

03:43.097 --> 03:47.310
<i>To be able to find</i>

04:00.949 --> 04:02.575
[somber music playing]

04:05.620 --> 04:07.247
<i>It was like slow motion.</i>

04:08.081 --> 04:11.834
<i>And it was like you're</i>
<i>watching someone </i>
<i>just drag themself</i>

04:12.252 --> 04:13.836
<i>across the field.</i>

04:16.547 --> 04:20.343

04:20.760 --> 04:23.179
<i>what their reaction is,</i>
<i>how they're reacting,</i>

04:23.471 --> 04:25.139
<i>and what they're doing,</i>

04:26.391 --> 04:28.059
[sighs] <i>it's so primitive.</i>

04:28.726 --> 04:30.019
<i>It's really raw,</i>

04:30.270 --> 04:31.646
<i>stripped down death.</i>

04:31.980 --> 04:33.189
<i>That's what it is.</i>

04:33.773 --> 04:36.359
<i>This is real.</i>

04:36.776 --> 04:37.735
<i>It's not a joke.</i>

04:39.696 --> 04:42.323
<i>I have specific memories</i>
<i>of any of them,</i>

04:42.407 --> 04:43.366
<i>that I know I killed.</i>

04:43.908 --> 04:44.993
<i>But, it's so messy, </i>

04:45.076 --> 04:47.328
<i>and they don't report it </i>
<i>down to us who we killed.</i>

04:48.454 --> 04:49.706

04:52.750 --> 04:53.835

04:56.754 --> 04:58.464
<i>And, I can say the drone</i>
<i>program's wrong,</i>

04:58.548 --> 05:00.717
<i>because, I don't know </i>
<i>how many people I've killed.</i>

05:05.388 --> 05:07.223
<i>After we do a strike,</i>
<i>I'd ask for a break,</i>

05:07.515 --> 05:10.643
<i>and, like, go outside</i>
<i>and smoke a cigarette,</i>
<i>and just think,</i>

05:10.768 --> 05:12.812
<i>and, like, try to decompress</i>
<i>and just try to...</i>

05:13.396 --> 05:17.191
<i>push the idea that I was</i>
<i>involved in killing people,</i>

05:17.567 --> 05:19.861

<i>and try not to think about it.</i>

05:20.069 --> 05:21.362

05:21.446 --> 05:23.489
really get out of this
situation for very long,

05:23.573 --> 05:24.907
I would just go
to the bathroom,

05:24.991 --> 05:26.451
and just sit
on the toilet.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.288
Like, just sit there
in my uniform
and just, like, cry.

05:30.413 --> 05:32.707
And just think about like,
what I was doing.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.084
It was just different
emotional responses.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.627
I mean, a lot
of times afterwards

05:36.711 --> 05:37.879
I would feel just empty,

05:37.962 --> 05:39.964
and, if I was crying,
it was because I just
didn't...

05:40.882 --> 05:44.010
know how to stop
feeling like that.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.845
How to stop feeling
like a shell.

05:47.305 --> 05:48.306
And, it was...

05:49.432 --> 05:51.225
that empty void.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.605
And it was, it was like always
shaking after we'd do a strike,

05:55.688 --> 05:58.399
'cause there's such
an adrenalin rush,
you're killing someone.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.278

it was okay to kill them.

I was, well aware that

was something that
I was against.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.504
That I disagreed with,

07:02.421 --> 07:05.007
I joined anyways
out of desperation

07:05.258 --> 07:07.552
because I was homeless,
I was desperate,

07:07.927 --> 07:09.428
I had nowhere else to go.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.557
I was on my last leg,

07:12.932 --> 07:17.395
and, the Air Force
was ready to accept me.

07:26.904 --> 07:29.490
<i>I still work in Intelligence,</i>
<i>as a contractor,</i>

07:29.574 --> 07:31.075

07:34.537 --> 07:36.956
<i>And, I still have </i>
<i>a top secret clearance.</i>

07:37.081 --> 07:38.040
<i>Uh, it's... </i>

07:38.124 --> 07:41.669
<i>Once you're given </i>
<i>a top secret clearance</i>
<i>it's good for five years,</i>

<i>and then it needs</i>

<i>every five years.</i>

07:44.964 --> 07:46.674
<i>And, when I leave this job,</i>

07:47.467 --> 07:48.885
<i>my clearance will expire.</i>

07:58.186 --> 08:00.146
Nobody ever thinks about
speaking out,

08:00.938 --> 08:02.732
against the government,
who's worked for them

08:02.815 --> 08:06.319
and hasn't considered
what the possible
consequences are.

08:06.402 --> 08:08.196
But, I don't dwell on them
because I don't...

08:09.530 --> 08:11.574
<i>I don't want it </i>
<i>to effect my voice. </i>

08:11.657 --> 08:13.326

<i>or to curtail my speech.</i>

08:18.122 --> 08:21.292
<i>"They" being the government,</i>
<i>"they" being</i>
<i>the Justice Department,</i>

08:21.709 --> 08:23.419

08:23.711 --> 08:26.631
<i>This ominous threat</i>
<i>that they'll go after me</i>

08:26.797 --> 08:29.717
<i>in the same way that</i>
<i>they've gone after</i>
<i>so many people.</i>

08:30.092 --> 08:31.385
<i>Specially since 9/11.</i>

08:40.019 --> 08:42.938
<i>I didn't find out </i>
<i>what I was gonna be doing </i>
<i>until I made it to Fort Bragg,</i>

08:43.022 --> 08:44.815
<i>for the Joint Special</i>
<i>Operations Command.</i>

08:45.858 --> 08:47.818
<i>At the time, I didn't really</i>
<i>realize the significance,</i>

08:47.902 --> 08:49.779
<i>or the importance </i>
<i>of the organization itself.</i>

08:51.322 --> 08:54.784
<i>I'd simply been told</i>
<i>by some people</i>
<i>in the military,</i>

08:54.867 --> 08:56.911
<i>"Oh, they're kind</i>
<i>of like, the elite".</i>

08:57.662 --> 09:00.790
<i>Special Ops people </i>
<i>that you hear about </i>
<i>in video games, and in movies.</i>

09:01.624 --> 09:03.501
<i>That they were </i>
<i>actually responsible </i>

09:03.584 --> 09:05.962
<i>for the killing</i>
<i>of Osama Bin Laden.</i>

09:06.671 --> 09:09.131
So, I would find targets
using signals intelligence.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.343
You know, I was stationed
at Fort Meade,

09:12.760 --> 09:14.220
which is where NSA
is headquartered.

09:14.428 --> 09:16.097
I had a clearance for NSA,

09:17.139 --> 09:19.225
I was... so... you know,

09:19.392 --> 09:23.604
NSA is the Intelligence
Directorate which handles
signals intelligence.

09:23.980 --> 09:27.191
So naturally, I would be put
in to a position,

09:27.275 --> 09:28.484
you know, overseas,

09:29.402 --> 09:31.571
working in a signals
intelligence capacity.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.281
And, using...

09:33.698 --> 09:36.909
the technology
on the drone through...

09:37.868 --> 09:39.453
a means of signals
intelligence...

09:39.870 --> 09:41.455
Sorry, it's really...

09:41.706 --> 09:44.041
really tough... I know...

09:44.125 --> 09:46.794
it's core and it's central
to what I was doing and like,

09:47.003 --> 09:48.379
my whole reason
for speaking here...

09:48.796 --> 09:52.383
So, but I'm also very unaware
where that line is drawn.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.676
And, um...

09:54.552 --> 09:57.346
So, I had to be very
extraordinarily cautious

09:57.430 --> 09:59.682
about what I can
and can't say on camera.

10:01.475 --> 10:02.310

10:09.108 --> 10:11.944

even have concerned...

10:12.486 --> 10:13.988
There's still... there's no,

10:14.405 --> 10:17.283
there's no doubt in my mind
that if I said the wrong...

10:17.700 --> 10:20.119
the wrong thing or gave away
the wrong kind of information

10:20.328 --> 10:22.830
about what I was doing,
that I...

10:24.332 --> 10:26.167
that I wouldn't...

10:27.293 --> 10:29.962
that I would be, you know,
safe from prosecution

12:37.506 --> 12:38.799

15:16.165 --> 15:18.500
<i>and then you can see,</i>

15:19.043 --> 15:20.544
<i>You can identify, like,</i>

15:20.836 --> 15:23.005
<i>that could be the lower half</i>
<i>of his body,</i>

15:23.255 --> 15:24.590

15:25.466 --> 15:26.550

15:26.926 --> 15:28.218

15:47.947 --> 15:49.281
<i>I was high risk</i>

15:49.365 --> 15:52.451

15:53.327 --> 15:55.746
<i>My psychologist called </i>
<i>my First Sergeant </i>

15:55.829 --> 15:56.830

<i>recommended that</i>

15:56.914 --> 16:00.584
<i>I be possibly moved</i>
<i>to anything that...</i>

16:01.460 --> 16:04.254
wasn't involving watching
people die all the time.

16:04.505 --> 16:07.883
And the First Sergeant said
that our team was undermanned,

16:08.008 --> 16:10.135
and that they absolutely
needed me to work mission,

16:10.594 --> 16:12.388
so, he would look into it,

16:12.680 --> 16:16.558
but never returned
my psychologist's phone calls,

16:17.309 --> 16:19.687
never gave him any
indications that I was...

16:20.145 --> 16:21.897
gonna be moved
to a better job.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.065
And I obviously wasn't.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.401
I stayed doing that job
until the last possible moment

16:25.484 --> 16:26.944
when they had to
let me out of process

16:27.027 --> 16:28.696
because I was actually
getting out of the military.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.658
So, I guess that's
the cost of a human life,

16:32.741 --> 16:35.285
because the fact that
I was on a suicide watchlist

16:35.369 --> 16:37.454
and they still wouldn't
allow me to do something else

16:37.538 --> 16:39.081
that might help me
a little bit

16:39.164 --> 16:41.458
obviously didn't matter
to the military, and that...

16:41.709 --> 16:45.504
that shows how much
the Air Force cares about
its intelligence troops.

<i>You could tell she'd</i>
<i>had a stressful day,</i>

17:14.032 --> 17:16.367
<i>if she'd call me up </i>
<i>and she'd be crying,</i>

17:16.452 --> 17:17.578

17:18.287 --> 17:19.872
<i>But then, she couldn't </i>
<i>talk about it.</i>

17:19.954 --> 17:23.125
<i>And then, when you ask her,</i>
<i>"Can you talk to </i>
<i>anybody else about it?"</i>

17:23.208 --> 17:25.127
<i>"Well no, we're not supposed</i>
<i>to talk to anybody".</i>

17:25.919 --> 17:27.588
<i>So, she...</i>

17:28.172 --> 17:29.965
<i>was having more</i>
<i>and more issues,</i>

17:30.382 --> 17:32.259
<i>each day that things went on.</i>

17:32.885 --> 17:36.305
A mom knows these things,
and then, when you hear
your daughter,

17:36.972 --> 17:39.099
talking to you
on the phone,

17:39.183 --> 17:41.101
and you can tell
that she's in trouble

17:41.518 --> 17:43.604
just by the emotion
and the inflection,

17:44.188 --> 17:46.273
in the stress that you
can hear in her voice,

17:46.356 --> 17:47.816
I knew she was in trouble.

17:48.525 --> 17:52.613
And, the only thing I could do
is just stay in touch with her
on a daily basis,

17:52.696 --> 17:54.740
so she felt like she
had someone there.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.285
Because I have a feeling
if somebody was there for her,

17:58.368 --> 17:59.828
she wouldn't
be here right now.

<i>at National Defense University</i>
<i>in Washington DC.</i>

18:33.654 --> 18:35.197
[Obama] <i> And before any</i>
<i>strike is taken,</i>

18:35.823 --> 18:39.952
<i>there must be near certainty</i>
<i>that</i> <i>no civilians will </i>
<i>be killed or injured.</i>

18:40.702 --> 18:42.871
<i>The highest standard </i>
<i>we can set.</i>

18:43.038 --> 18:47.000
<i>Yes, the conflict </i>
<i>with Al Qaeda, </i>
<i>like all armed conflict,</i>

18:47.459 --> 18:48.627
<i>invites tragedy.</i>

18:51.088 --> 18:54.716
<i>But by narrowly targeting </i>
<i>our action</i> <i>against those </i>
<i>who want to kill us,</i>

18:55.467 --> 18:57.928
<i>and not the people </i>
<i>they hide among,</i>

18:59.054 --> 19:01.974
<i>we are choosing</i>
<i>the course of action</i>
<i>least likely,</i>

19:02.307 --> 19:04.601

19:22.953 --> 19:24.746
<i>he can't say otherwise.</i>

19:25.164 --> 19:26.999
<i>Because, any time,</i>

<i>an action is taken </i>
<i>to finish a target,</i>

19:29.793 --> 19:32.588
<i>there is a certain amount</i>
<i>of guesswork in that action.</i>

19:32.963 --> 19:35.382
Because it's only
in the aftermath

19:36.049 --> 19:37.718
of any kind of ordinance
being dropped,

19:37.843 --> 19:40.512
that you know just how much
actual damage was done.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.681
And, often times...

19:43.140 --> 19:45.684
the intelligence committee
is reliant,

the Joint Special
Operations Command,

coming afterwards,

19:52.608 --> 19:56.403
that confirms that
who they were targeting
was killed in that strike.

just for myself,

25:13.511 --> 25:16.514
like, this isn't some kind
of self-healing thing for me.

25:17.057 --> 25:19.976
Like, I've found more
self-healing through doing
massage and everything.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.312
This isn't even that
therapeutic for me.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.731
Every time I do
one of these things I'm like,

25:25.315 --> 25:26.441
I feel awful.

25:26.524 --> 25:28.902
'Cause then I have
to talk about it
and tell people about it

25:28.985 --> 25:30.987
and all kinds of stuff, and
people think that my stories

25:31.071 --> 25:32.614
are all mega-important
or something.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.325
And it's... I'm not
saying this for like,

25:35.742 --> 25:38.745
the importance of... myself.

25:38.828 --> 25:39.996
I'm saying it because,

25:40.163 --> 25:43.500
I need to say it
because my other
veteran friends are, like,

25:43.583 --> 25:45.585
too drunk to spend time
to say anything about it

25:45.669 --> 25:47.504
or they're not around anymore.

25:48.922 --> 25:51.675
Trying to just get people
to change how they view
things are, like,

25:51.758 --> 25:52.968
policy makers
aren't listening.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.552
Policy makers
don't care.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.429
It's not gonna
change anything.

25:56.846 --> 25:58.473
So, I'm gonna put myself
out there at risk.

26:00.141 --> 26:03.645
Being put on some kind of
FBI watchlist or something
for just saying that,

26:03.770 --> 26:06.273
"Yeah, the drone program
makes people feel bad."

26:06.815 --> 26:09.025
Like, I'm basically saying,

26:09.567 --> 26:12.362
the drone program can give you
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

26:12.612 --> 26:14.781
That shouldn't be a surprise,
and like...

26:15.573 --> 26:18.201
for me to just say something
like that and then have people

26:18.952 --> 26:20.287
say it's not gonna
make a change,

26:20.370 --> 26:22.372
"You're gonna be
the next Edward Snowden,"

26:22.539 --> 26:24.374
it just...
it pisses me off, like...

26:24.749 --> 26:26.626
And it makes me
not even wanna try,

26:26.710 --> 26:28.837
because, if I'm gonna
get all this awful
horrifying attention

26:28.920 --> 26:30.463
from the government
and stuff, like...

26:31.840 --> 26:32.882
What's the point?

26:33.550 --> 26:35.218
If someone
comes to my house

26:35.302 --> 26:37.095
and puts a bag over my head
and hauls me away,

26:37.178 --> 26:38.930
then what was the point
of anything I did?

26:39.931 --> 26:41.725
Am I really changing
people's minds?

26:42.017 --> 26:44.728
Or are people just
gonna share it on Facebook
and then move along?

26:46.813 --> 26:47.939
[sniffles]

26:49.441 --> 26:51.776
I'm spending all this time
doing all this stuff

26:51.860 --> 26:53.570
and it could be
for absolutely nothing.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.613
[sniffles] Like, I could be...

26:56.948 --> 26:58.033
living a normal life,

26:58.116 --> 27:00.285
spending time with friends,
spending time with family.

27:00.618 --> 27:03.038
And like, I'm spending
all this time for this thing,

27:03.371 --> 27:05.540
that I don't know if anybody's
even gonna care about.

27:05.623 --> 27:07.709
And I don't know if anybody's
gonna be like,

27:08.418 --> 27:11.921
"Oh, let's really care
about these soldiers
in the drone program,

27:12.005 --> 27:14.799
"'cause according to all
that are Left, we're all
a bunch of baby killers.

27:14.883 --> 27:17.260
"And according to the Right,
we shouldn't be
having any problems

27:17.344 --> 27:19.262
"'cause we're not walking
around in Afghanistan."

27:46.623 --> 27:48.124
<i>So, Jesselyn Radack.</i>

27:50.627 --> 27:52.295
<i>I represent seven people</i>

27:52.629 --> 27:54.798

<i>Espionage Act prosecutions</i>
<i>occur largely in secret,</i>

28:05.225 --> 28:08.061

28:09.521 --> 28:11.106
<i>I hope that will change.</i>

28:11.898 --> 28:15.068
<i>I hope also that</i>
<i>whistle-blower protection </i>
<i>will be extended </i>

28:15.151 --> 28:19.030
<i>to protect people</i>
<i>in the national security</i>
<i>and intelligence arenas,</i>

28:19.614 --> 28:23.326
<i>who have made all </i>
<i>of the bombshell disclosures </i>
<i>about war crimes,</i>

28:23.410 --> 28:25.870
<i>about torture, </i>
<i>about secret surveillance,</i>

28:26.371 --> 28:30.041
<i>that you've heard about</i>
<i>over the past decade.</i>

28:37.590 --> 28:39.467
[Heather] When the Guardian
thing first happened,

28:39.592 --> 28:40.593
I was so scared

28:40.677 --> 28:42.721
'cause everybody started
calling me a whistle-blower
and saying like,

28:42.804 --> 28:44.222
"This is another
Edward Snowden".

28:44.347 --> 28:46.224
I didn't think I mentioned
anything classified

28:46.307 --> 28:48.560
but they started saying, like,
"She mentioned capabilities."

28:48.852 --> 28:51.813
Well, most whistle-blowers
are not blowing the whistle
on classified,

28:51.938 --> 28:55.275
and if they do have access
to classified information,

28:55.567 --> 28:56.985
they're able
to blow the whistle

28:57.068 --> 29:01.406
on things without ever
getting into the classified.

29:01.489 --> 29:04.200
And, what you're disclosing
that hasn't been out there,

29:04.534 --> 29:08.747
is the ill-effect and
the horrible negative effect
that this has had

29:09.289 --> 29:11.833
on the actual people
doing the work.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.084
-Yeah.
-And...

29:13.334 --> 29:15.378
On the innocent people
being blown up,

29:15.503 --> 29:17.297
and the shaky
legal reasoning.

29:17.505 --> 29:19.758
I mean, all three of these
are the perfect storm,

29:20.842 --> 29:23.261
of this claustrofuck that we
call the Drone Program.

29:23.803 --> 29:25.180

29:46.701 --> 29:49.454
[woman on TV] <i> </i>
<i>In a major policy </i>
<i>address on Thursday,</i>

29:49.537 --> 29:52.415
<i>President Obama defended </i>
<i>the secret overseas drone war</i>

29:52.499 --> 29:54.918

<i>cannot</i> <i>continue waging </i>

29:55.001 --> 29:57.796
<i>what he described as </i>
<i>a boundless global war </i>

29:58.046 --> 30:00.006
<i>Obama's comments </i>
<i>came one day</i>

30:00.089 --> 30:03.343
<i>after Attorney General, </i>
<i>Eric Holder,</i> <i>confirmed </i>
<i>US drone strikes</i>

30:03.426 --> 30:06.387
<i>had killed four US citizens</i>
<i>in Yemen and Pakistan.</i>

30:07.263 --> 30:09.307
[Obama] <i> Simply put, </i>
<i>these strikes </i>
<i>have saved lives.</i>

30:10.767 --> 30:13.311
<i>Moreover, America's actions</i>

30:15.021 --> 30:16.564
<i>We were attacked on 9/11.</i>

30:18.274 --> 30:22.111
<i>Within a week, Congress</i>
<i>overwhelmingly</i> <i>authorized</i>

30:23.196 --> 30:24.656
[Daniel] The people
who defend drones

30:24.739 --> 30:26.533
and defend the way that
they're used, they always say,

30:26.616 --> 30:30.829
they protect American lives
by not putting them
in harm's way.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.832
What they really do is, they
just embolden commanders.

30:33.915 --> 30:35.291
They embolden decision makers.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.418
Because, there is no threat,

30:37.794 --> 30:39.462
there is no
immediate consequence.

30:39.754 --> 30:42.382
<i>They can do this strike</i>
<i>and they can potentially</i>
<i>kill this person,</i>

30:42.507 --> 30:44.092
<i>that they're </i>
<i>so desperate to get</i>

30:44.217 --> 30:47.679
<i>and to eliminate,</i>
<i>because of how dangerous,</i>

<i>potentially dangerous </i>
<i>they could be to US.</i>

<i>kill that person</i>

30:54.143 --> 30:56.145
<i>or some other people</i>
<i>are involved in the strike,</i>

30:56.229 --> 30:57.355
<i>and get killed as well,</i>

30:57.438 --> 30:59.440
<i>you know, there's no</i>
<i>consequence for it.</i>

31:04.279 --> 31:05.989
<i>When it comes </i>
<i>to high value targets,</i>

31:06.364 --> 31:09.701
<i>every mission is to go</i>

31:10.702 --> 31:13.746
<i>But anybody else that's</i>

31:14.789 --> 31:18.334
just blatantly assumed
to be an associate

31:19.043 --> 31:20.295
of the targeted individual.

31:23.965 --> 31:26.593
<i>So as long as they can</i>

31:26.926 --> 31:29.804

31:30.179 --> 31:31.973

32:10.428 --> 32:14.015
[Daniel] <i>People often times</i>

<i>the anti-drone movement,</i>

32:14.724 --> 32:16.684
<i>trying to say that we should</i>
<i>just ground drones </i>

32:16.768 --> 32:18.978
<i>and we should </i>
<i>just eliminate drones </i>
<i>from our lexicon</i>

32:19.062 --> 32:21.189
<i>and never allow them</i>
<i>to exist in this world.</i>

32:21.564 --> 32:22.732
<i>It's just too dangerous.</i>

32:23.358 --> 32:26.694
<i>And I don't necessarily </i>
<i>agree with them, because,</i>

32:27.111 --> 32:29.989
drones are gonna be a part
of our life here pretty soon.

32:30.073 --> 32:33.159
They're gonna be,
most likely, they're gonna be
doing things that,

32:33.618 --> 32:37.372
that we were only able to do
with people in a plane before.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.333
It'll be like dusting crops,

32:40.416 --> 32:44.045
or planting seeds or doing
humanitarian surveillance,

32:44.379 --> 32:45.880
during floods and disasters...

32:47.090 --> 32:48.716
to try and locate victims.

32:49.342 --> 32:50.510
You know, they're
gonna be there.

32:51.469 --> 32:54.097
<i>But there's also that other</i>
<i>dangerous side to them</i>

32:54.180 --> 32:56.599
<i>that makes war so easy</i>
<i>and so convenient,</i>

32:56.891 --> 32:57.934
<i>and so simple </i>

32:58.017 --> 33:00.478

33:05.316 --> 33:06.609
[somber music playing]

33:10.905 --> 33:14.617
<i>The most disturbing thing</i>
<i>about my involvement</i>
<i>in drones</i>

33:14.742 --> 33:16.869
<i>is the uncertainty,</i>

33:17.537 --> 33:20.581
<i>if anybody that I was involved</i>
<i>in kill or capture,</i>

33:21.874 --> 33:23.126
<i>was a civilian or not.</i>

33:24.293 --> 33:25.503
<i>There's no way of knowing.</i>

33:31.509 --> 33:33.970
[Lisa] <i> There's a bomb,</i>
<i>they drop it...</i>

33:35.638 --> 33:36.764
<i>It explodes.</i>

33:38.683 --> 33:39.684
Then what?

33:40.810 --> 33:41.853
<i>Does somebody </i>
<i>go down there </i>

33:41.936 --> 33:43.813

33:44.063 --> 33:46.774
<i>"Excuse me, sir, can I have </i>

33:47.191 --> 33:48.484

33:49.485 --> 33:50.528
<i>How do we know?</i>

33:50.862 --> 33:53.990
<i>How is it possible to know </i>
<i>who ends up living or dying?</i>

33:59.954 --> 34:02.874
[woman] So, folks, welcome
to the Commonwealth Club.

34:02.957 --> 34:05.001
We have the great
privilege tonight

34:05.084 --> 34:08.295
to have a chance to talk
with General
Stanley McChrystal,

34:08.670 --> 34:13.467
who had a very distinguished
34-year career
in the American military.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.678
His last assignment

34:15.762 --> 34:19.098
was as the commander
of the International
Security Assistance Force,

34:19.389 --> 34:20.766
in Afghanistan.

34:21.225 --> 34:23.143
Won't you
Commonwealth Club members

34:23.226 --> 34:25.103
join me in welcoming
Stan McChrystal.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.027
[Stan] Think about
today's world.

34:32.445 --> 34:35.697
You can get information
from everywhere in real time.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.867
You can talk to anyone
in your organization.

34:37.949 --> 34:40.328
In my Situational Awareness
Room where we called it,

34:40.411 --> 34:42.288
we had about 12 screens
on the wall.

34:42.496 --> 34:45.541
And they were all showing
operations in real time,

34:46.042 --> 34:47.418
full motion video,
we called it.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.420
Like the live TV
from Predator

34:49.629 --> 34:51.089
unmanned aerial vehicles
above them.

34:51.172 --> 34:53.591
So, we could watch
every one of our operators,

34:53.674 --> 34:55.259
landing a helicopter,
get out of a vehicle,

34:55.342 --> 34:56.260
move on the target.

34:56.552 --> 34:59.722
And because of a system
we set up that went through
our secure Internet,

35:00.014 --> 35:02.350
we could hear
every radio transmission

35:02.725 --> 35:05.520
and if I was sitting
in Baghdad, I could hear
radio transmissions

35:05.603 --> 35:06.687
from a raid
in Afghanistan.

35:07.522 --> 35:08.481
And if I wanted to,

35:08.564 --> 35:12.610
I could reach down and talk
to Sergeant X, on the ground,

35:13.528 --> 35:15.196
on an objective in Afghanistan.

35:15.738 --> 35:19.450
Now, I never did that
but the technology now
allows you to do that.

35:19.992 --> 35:22.245
So, the first thing
to understand is that,
that's deceptive.

35:23.079 --> 35:26.415
It's seductive and deceptive,
because, if you see things
in two dimension

35:26.499 --> 35:29.544
you get the opinion that
you're at 10,000 feet,
you see this photograph,

35:32.713 --> 35:34.465
You know what you see
in two dimensions.

35:34.757 --> 35:36.175
[indistinct chatter]

35:44.100 --> 35:45.017
Lisa, L-I-S-A?

35:45.268 --> 35:46.185
Yup.

35:48.354 --> 35:49.856
And... I'm...

35:50.857 --> 35:52.191
Go on with
the question, please.

35:52.441 --> 35:55.903
Okay, so, I'm very curious,
I understand that you're...

35:56.362 --> 35:58.281
a little weary about
the drone program,

35:58.364 --> 36:00.658
-Uh-huh.
-and I'm wondering,
what your...

36:02.034 --> 36:03.452
views of the program are.

36:03.619 --> 36:06.622
Yeah, I think drones
are here to stay,
and they're necessary.

36:07.081 --> 36:10.251
But you have to understand
how people perceive things.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.421
So, it's one thing
to do things,
but it's another

36:13.546 --> 36:15.548
to anger a population
in the process.

36:15.965 --> 36:18.885
So, I think you got to make
that value decision,
you gotta say...

36:19.093 --> 36:21.929
In each case you gotta
make the decision,
"Is it worth it?"

36:22.430 --> 36:24.140
Because, you are gonna create,

36:24.557 --> 36:26.642
you know, some ill-will
in the process.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.187
I also think we need
to explain it
to the world better.

36:30.521 --> 36:33.524
But again, I'm not one
of those people who thinks
it's not gonna be around.

36:33.608 --> 36:35.318
-I mean, technology
doesn't go back.
-Oh, no. It doesn't.

36:35.401 --> 36:37.320
Yeah, once it's out
of the bag,
it's out of the bag.

36:37.445 --> 36:39.780
And it's not immoral or moral,

36:40.281 --> 36:43.159
but it has to be understood
and it has to be described
to people.

36:43.242 --> 36:44.702
It has to be
very carefully used.

36:44.994 --> 36:47.038
I just think
it's that important.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.540
Well, I just wanna say,
thank you.
I've read your book,

36:49.624 --> 36:51.500
and I so appreciate
your understanding...

36:51.584 --> 36:52.877
Well, you're kind.
Thank you so much.

<i>in and out of the house</i>
<i>at different points</i>

45:39.862 --> 45:41.989
<i>Once they were done,</i>
<i>they left,</i>

45:42.114 --> 45:44.741
and I didn't even have
a phone on me,

45:44.825 --> 45:47.035
so I had retained a number.

45:48.871 --> 45:51.915
One of the agents allowed me
to retrieve a number
from my phone,

45:53.667 --> 45:57.379
and, then I used that
to call my friends in DC,

45:57.671 --> 45:59.798
to ask them
if they could, uh,

46:00.215 --> 46:03.844
if they could help me
get in touch with
the right people that,

46:04.178 --> 46:07.598
that knew how to deal
with these kinds of cases.

46:07.973 --> 46:11.101
Once I was in touch
with Daniel, we met at...

46:11.935 --> 46:16.523
one location, and promptly
moved to another location.

46:17.107 --> 46:21.778
And he started telling me
what was going on and,
it became very apparent

46:22.237 --> 46:25.908
that he had been subject
to search warrants

46:25.991 --> 46:28.869
that he had
brought with him
and showed me.

46:29.912 --> 46:34.333
And I drafted up
an Attorney-Client agreement,
a temporary one,

46:34.666 --> 46:35.792
on a napkin,

46:36.752 --> 46:39.713
so I could provide
immediate representation

46:40.255 --> 46:42.966
then eventually was able to
do a full agreement with him.

46:43.050 --> 46:45.010
But he was terrified.

46:45.844 --> 46:47.304
Everything that

46:49.223 --> 46:50.432
we know so far,

46:51.808 --> 46:53.644
between me
and my attorneys,

46:53.769 --> 46:55.103
I've been keeping it
in here.

46:55.437 --> 46:59.525
And it's basically
just the warrants
that were issued that day,

46:59.733 --> 47:02.361
and the items
that they took.

47:08.325 --> 47:10.536
And, so there were
three warrants issued,

47:10.702 --> 47:13.580
one for the room
of the house
that I was in,

47:13.664 --> 47:14.706
and the house itself...

47:16.583 --> 47:19.753
The... there's
a warrant issued

47:19.836 --> 47:22.673
for me and my smartphone,

47:23.131 --> 47:25.008
that I may have
in my possession.

47:27.386 --> 47:28.720
There's this...

47:30.305 --> 47:31.890
there's one
for my motorcycle.

47:33.267 --> 47:35.352
And then there's...

47:36.770 --> 47:38.438
a list of all the things
that they took.

47:38.814 --> 47:41.149
So basically there
was a list for electronics,

47:41.525 --> 47:43.485
and there was a list
for papers.

47:44.069 --> 47:46.780
The next was just
an explanation of what
they were looking for.

47:48.740 --> 47:51.994
So under category one,
"Information documents
in a format or medium,

47:52.703 --> 47:54.788
"all originals,
computer files, copies

47:54.871 --> 47:56.832
"and manipulated
versions of that

47:56.915 --> 47:59.042
"are the property of
the United States government

47:59.126 --> 48:01.128
"or any agency of
the United States government

48:01.211 --> 48:04.840
"including the NSA,
the NGA, JSOC,

48:04.965 --> 48:07.759
"the Department of Defense,
the Department of
the Air Force.

48:08.176 --> 48:13.515
"All classified information
materials or documents are
defined in 18 USC 1924."

48:14.141 --> 48:17.728
So those five departments
or agencies,

48:18.228 --> 48:19.688
however, you look at them,

48:20.063 --> 48:22.983
those are all places
I have worked for.

48:24.026 --> 48:27.321
793 E, and 1030 A1 B,

48:27.696 --> 48:29.114
1030 A2 B,

48:29.823 --> 48:32.075
and 1924.

48:32.492 --> 48:34.369
So, I'd have to actually
do some research on that,

48:34.453 --> 48:35.912
I should have
probably done that.

48:36.246 --> 48:37.289
If I, uh...

48:37.873 --> 48:39.374
if I were more
responsible for myself.

48:39.708 --> 48:43.086
But I'm pretty sure that all
this intels generic blanket,

48:43.670 --> 48:46.298
this is
a criminal investigation
for the Espionage Act.

48:48.717 --> 48:50.093

basically it paints you
as an enemy of the state.

49:01.813 --> 49:04.775
<i>And it's a David </i>
<i>versus Goliath struggle.</i>

49:04.858 --> 49:06.818
<i>It is a single person </i>

49:06.902 --> 49:08.945
<i>against the entire </i>
<i>executive branch</i>

49:09.029 --> 49:10.656
<i>of the United States</i>
<i>government.</i>

49:11.531 --> 49:13.950
<i>And that's the kind of power</i>
<i>we're supposed to reserve</i>

49:14.034 --> 49:15.661
<i>for going after </i>
<i>our enemies.</i>

49:15.827 --> 49:18.455
<i>Not after people</i>
<i>who are patriotic.</i>

49:28.048 --> 49:29.591
[slow music playing]

50:10.716 --> 50:13.427
[Lisa] <i>We're going to meet</i>

50:17.931 --> 50:22.602
<i>I wanna respect them</i>
<i>and so I'll stay back,</i>

50:23.687 --> 50:24.730

50:25.480 --> 50:29.401
<i>I can't imagine how</i>
<i>they'd feel seeing somebody</i>

50:30.360 --> 50:33.739
<i>that worked on the system</i>
<i>that killed their child,</i>

50:33.822 --> 50:38.952
<i>or killed members </i>
<i>of their family </i>
<i>or took limbs.</i>

50:39.911 --> 50:42.164
<i>So, I'll stay back,</i>

50:43.081 --> 50:46.960
<i>and Asma will be there</i>
<i>and talk to them.</i>

51:16.448 --> 51:18.283
[speaking in foreign language]
Where did Suhrab lose his leg?

51:18.366 --> 51:21.787
In the same incident
in which his father died.

51:21.870 --> 51:23.121
That's when he was injured,

51:23.622 --> 51:30.003
before his father could get
him and the other one out.

51:30.086 --> 51:32.172
My other son Morteza
was killed.

51:32.255 --> 51:35.383
My husband had him on his
chest and was trying

51:35.675 --> 51:37.761
to get him and my daughter out
of the car,

51:38.929 --> 51:43.892
when they were hit.

51:46.728 --> 51:49.189
What was the name
of the little one,
who was killed?

51:49.272 --> 51:50.357
Morteza.

51:50.440 --> 51:51.316
How old was he?

51:51.399 --> 51:52.400
Four years old.

51:54.653 --> 51:56.071
Who else was killed?

51:56.279 --> 51:58.281
Sima. She was my daughter.
Seven years old.

52:01.076 --> 52:05.622
Parents see no difference,

52:06.164 --> 52:08.583
but my daughter

52:11.336 --> 52:13.505
was very beautiful.

52:13.839 --> 52:15.507
I loved her.

52:16.591 --> 52:18.802
God took her from us.

52:19.261 --> 52:21.304
My son was also a good boy.

52:22.347 --> 52:23.765
[helicopter whirring]

52:24.683 --> 52:26.768
I loved him as well.

52:49.875 --> 52:51.334
Oh God!

52:53.420 --> 52:55.338
May God bring peace
to the country!

52:57.549 --> 53:01.136
Our reason for traveling
such a long way,

53:01.511 --> 53:05.307
is that the world community
can hear our voice,

53:05.932 --> 53:08.018
and will learn about
our helpless situation.

53:08.727 --> 53:11.771
So they can see now
how this brutal attack

53:12.105 --> 53:13.023
has destroyed families,

53:13.857 --> 53:17.110
<i>and has wounded, maimed</i>
<i>and killed them.</i>

53:17.193 --> 53:18.486
<i>That's why we are here.</i>

53:36.296 --> 53:38.548
<i>I was a student </i>

53:39.799 --> 53:42.260
and wanted to continue
my education
to become a doctor.

53:43.762 --> 53:47.098
I wanted to do
something positive

53:47.390 --> 53:48.767
for the future
of my people and society.

53:50.518 --> 53:53.438
We were a group of students,

53:54.105 --> 53:56.983
some sick people,
and travelers

53:57.067 --> 54:01.071
who wanted to visit
family and friends.

55:08.221 --> 55:09.389
[mc] <i>They're reviewing.</i>

55:17.063 --> 55:18.606

[mc] <i>They're gonna do </i>

55:51.264 --> 55:53.641
[speaking in foreign language]
There is a rest area
on the way

55:53.725 --> 55:56.519
where we stopped
to pray.

55:56.936 --> 55:59.731
We got out of our cars,
men and women.

56:01.191 --> 56:03.902
After our prayer, we left.

56:03.985 --> 56:09.824
That's when we heard
the sound of a plane.

56:09.908 --> 56:11.201
But we couldn't see it.

56:13.578 --> 56:16.498
There were two
black helicopters.

56:16.873 --> 56:21.377
And there was also
a white plane that
made a "bing" sound.

56:21.544 --> 56:23.004
It was hovering above us.

56:24.297 --> 56:30.178
We often hear that drones.

56:33.556 --> 56:37.727
Can see everything
by day and by night.

56:39.270 --> 56:42.357
That's what pains me.

56:43.858 --> 56:50.198
You can see the difference
between a needle and an ant,
but not people?

56:50.281 --> 56:55.203
We were sitting
in the pick-up truck,

56:55.286 --> 56:57.247
some even on the bed.

56:57.705 --> 56:58.915
How can you not identify us?

56:59.457 --> 57:02.794
Did you not see that
there were travelers,
women and children?

59:07.418 --> 59:10.922
The men said that the women
should get out of the car.

59:11.464 --> 59:15.677
We thought that they would
stop when they see women.

They're saying the DGS

We went to school

to be able to identify
women and children.

calling this out.

01:05:01.689 --> 01:05:03.232
And then they just have
an outright lie

01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:05.067
that DGS didn't call out
any women or children

01:05:05.151 --> 01:05:06.527
prior to this point when...

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:12.491
about an hour before that
was when they killed
all those people,

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:15.536
and DGS was saying right
before they killed them
that they saw children.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:23.085
I know what crews
did this mission,

01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:24.211
and it wasn't at my base.

01:05:24.295 --> 01:05:25.421
I can safely say that.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:28.090
'Cause I remember
this call sign.

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:32.803
But... this wasn't...
these crews weren't...

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:36.182
This DGS wasn't my DGS,
but they're all set up
the same,

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:38.184
in terms of the people
that are working them,

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:40.686
and that's just such bullshit.

01:05:41.812 --> 01:05:44.148
There's this one thing in here
where the pilot's typing...

01:05:46.525 --> 01:05:49.487
"The lady is carrying a kid,
huh? Maybe."

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:52.156
And then the sensor
operator says, "Uh, yeah".

01:05:52.239 --> 01:05:53.991
If you were to read
a DGS transcript,

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:55.826
which you'll never
be able get your hands on,

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.871
you would see
lingo and jargon

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:02.458
specifically designed to make
statements short,

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:04.877
and make them possible,
probable or confirmed.

01:06:05.711 --> 01:06:08.547
You wouldn't be seeing people
saying, "Maybe it's a kid".

01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:09.924
"Uh, we don't know".

01:06:10.216 --> 01:06:12.843
"Uh, we think,
it's a possible woman."

01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:17.014
[scoffs] I couldn't talk
about this stuff,
because it's classified.

01:06:17.723 --> 01:06:20.559
But now that I have
this unclassified thing
sitting right in front of me,

01:06:20.851 --> 01:06:23.145

saying all this shit
about us.

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:29.443
We were the ones who had
to really stop them
all the fucking time.

01:06:29.527 --> 01:06:32.196
You shouldn't have to stop
your own people
from killing civilians.

people of Afghanistan,
Salaam-Alaikum.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.880
I've spoken
with President Karzai,

01:06:50.047 --> 01:06:51.257
and apologized to him.

01:06:51.590 --> 01:06:52.967
And to the Afghan people.

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:56.012
I've instituted a thorough
investigation,

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.097
to prevent this
from happening again.

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:02.268
We're extremely saddened
by this tragic loss
of innocent lives.

01:07:02.727 --> 01:07:04.311
I've made it clear
to our forces,

01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:06.605
that we are here
to protect the Afghan people.

01:07:07.064 --> 01:07:10.026
I pledge to strengthen our
efforts to regain your trust,

01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:13.112
to build a brighter future
for all Afghans.

01:07:14.572 --> 01:07:17.366
Most importantly,
I express my deepest,

01:07:17.825 --> 01:07:19.994
heartfelt condolences
to the victims,

01:07:20.327 --> 01:07:21.370
and to their families.

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:23.456
We all share in their grief,

01:07:23.622 --> 01:07:25.958
and will keep them
in our thoughts
and prayers.

There are no hospitals

No Red Cross stations.

01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:48.272

[woman] You know,
there was three buses

full of people,
from this village,

01:09:02.011 --> 01:09:03.848
and one of the story
was that,

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:07.393
the wife lost the husband
and her child.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:11.604

he turned around,

They're not stupid,
they know exactly what it is.

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:33.127
They know it's drones,
they know it's helicopters.

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:35.837
They told us, drone is...

01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:39.758
A plane from above
and has cameras,
and they can watch and look

01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:41.176
and take information.

When did you

August. Yeah.

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:13.329
Probably remember
back in like, August,

-and asking you about about
-Yeah.

So, it's a long story to that.

I'm okay...but it's a bit
of a legal matter.

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:24.131
I just want to thank you
again for being available.

01:12:24.214 --> 01:12:27.051
That's really very like...
if I couldn't get a hold
of you

01:12:27.301 --> 01:12:28.635
I didn't know what
I was going to do.

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.095
Yeah, any time.

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:31.263
Yeah, thanks.

01:12:32.473 --> 01:12:33.640
But it only got resolved?

01:12:33.974 --> 01:12:36.185
It's in the middle of being
resolved. Hopefully.

01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:39.688
But, as far as
now is concerned,
I can't talk about it.

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:43.192
Right now my
biggest concern is, uh...

01:12:44.068 --> 01:12:46.278
it's certainly not school.
Even though I'm in school.

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:50.324
And it's basically like
the least thing I'm least
focused on,

01:12:50.407 --> 01:12:53.160
even though it should
be the number one
priority right now.

01:12:53.285 --> 01:12:55.996
But right now, I'm just
constantly...

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:58.791
going over my head
and constantly...

01:12:58.999 --> 01:13:00.459
thinking about
what I'm saying.

01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:02.252
And whom I'm saying it to.

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:05.297
And making sure that I'm not

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:06.799
saying anything to somebody,

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:08.675
whether a stranger
or somebody I know,

01:13:09.009 --> 01:13:11.387
someone I think I can trust
or I know I can't trust.

01:13:11.678 --> 01:13:14.264
I'm always afraid of saying
the wrong thing
at the wrong time.

01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:18.435
And I'm always second guessing
my words everywhere I go.

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:22.481
I mean, personally I just
live everyday trying to...

01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:25.651
become more and more
comfortable with the idea

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:27.194
that it's probably
gonna happen,

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:30.948
that I'm probably gonna get
indicted, and I'm probably
gonna get charged,

01:13:31.281 --> 01:13:32.741
with a crime and that,

01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:35.494
there's probably a real chance
I'll have to fight

01:13:35.828 --> 01:13:37.454
to stay out of prison.

01:13:38.455 --> 01:13:40.874
I think it's kind of funny,
a little ironic too,

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:43.043
because, uh...

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:44.878
so far I'm probably the...

01:13:45.671 --> 01:13:48.424
only adult male
in my entire family,

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:53.554

that has not been
to prison so far.

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:58.559

from a long lineage
of prisoners, actually.

of fuck ups

and go driving

when they shouldn't
be carrying a gun.

at the wrong time.

I don't know.

01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:24.918

they meet in prison.

answer for that.

owe legal bills upwards
of a million dollars.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.963

take you through
