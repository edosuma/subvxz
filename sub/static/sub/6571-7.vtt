00:03.503 --> 00:05.403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.115 --> 00:16.776
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:20.286 --> 00:23.050
<i>[Man Narrating] Michael Bluth</i>
<i>had scheduled a meeting with Stan Sitwell...</i>

00:23.156 --> 00:25.590
<i>the Bluth Company's</i>
<i>chief competitor.</i>

00:25.692 --> 00:27.751
Why are we having this meeting at home?

00:27.861 --> 00:31.661
Let him see he's not the only one
who builds solid houses, you know?

00:33.733 --> 00:36.463
I think he'll be pretty impressed,
knock on wood.

00:40.540 --> 00:45.000
<i>[Narrator] In fact, Michael was meeting</i>
<i>at home at the behest ofhis fugitive father.</i>

00:45.111 --> 00:46.908
<i>[Michael]</i>
<i>... knock on wood.</i>

00:47.013 --> 00:49.504
[Gob] Don't you find the timing
of this meeting a little suspicious?

00:49.616 --> 00:52.915
Right before we play
<i>his</i> company in softball?

00:53.019 --> 00:55.988
No, no. Our business is in trouble,
and I think he sees an opportunity.

00:56.089 --> 00:59.058
So, I figured the guy's a family man,
why not invite him over...

00:59.159 --> 01:01.787
- let him see us in our element.
- I hope you don't mean the whole family...

01:01.895 --> 01:04.590
- 'cause George Michael's off with Ann.
- Ann?

01:04.697 --> 01:07.996
<i>Hmm. That'll play well with Sitwell.</i>
<i>"Where's your son?" "He's out with Ann."</i>

01:08.101 --> 01:10.968
"Who's Ann?" "Don't ask me,
I'm just the boy's father."

01:11.071 --> 01:13.539
Hey, screw Sitwell!
He comes in here telling us...

01:13.640 --> 01:17.303
how to build our houses,
how to raise our kids.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.776
We know what we're doing.
We don't need any help from him.

01:19.879 --> 01:23.508
- [Clatters]
- Damn it. This thing got pushed in again.

01:23.616 --> 01:25.777
- Gonna need a butter knife.
- <i>That's what I'm talking about.</i>

01:25.885 --> 01:28.285
George Michael's got these powerful
little fingers. He should be here.

01:28.388 --> 01:31.186
How do you think I feel?
He said he would help me on this essay...

01:31.291 --> 01:34.260
- for <i>The Old Man and the Sea.</i>
- <i>[Michael] I'll help you with that later.</i>

01:34.360 --> 01:38.524
Oh, great. Okay. So you have to
read this, and then explain it...

01:38.631 --> 01:41.122
and, this is important,
say it in my own words, okay?

01:41.234 --> 01:44.032
Smart, but not too smart.
Let's have a four-syllable max.

01:44.137 --> 01:47.072
Do you wanna say something
or should I, Tobias?

01:47.173 --> 01:49.801
No. I believe in letting children learn
from their mistakes, Michael.

01:49.909 --> 01:54.107
They make a mistake once,
they shan't make it twice.

01:54.214 --> 01:56.580
Oh, here I go!

01:56.683 --> 02:01.245
<i>Don't worry. It has not fallen</i>
<i>into the garage. Knock on wood.</i>

02:01.354 --> 02:03.322
<i>[Clattering]</i>

02:03.423 --> 02:05.482
- [Inhales]
- You gonna want to help me with that?

02:05.592 --> 02:08.083
No, I can't.
I have an audition tomorrow.

02:08.193 --> 02:12.563
I'm up for a minor, but meaty, role
in a feature film.

02:12.665 --> 02:16.328
- "Confidence Man Two."
- Oh, yeah? I didn't see the first <i>Confidence Man.</i>

02:16.436 --> 02:19.030
No. Confidence Man Two
is my character.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.540
I think I'll drive up today
and plot my route to the studio.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.872
How 'bout I come with you?
I could help you prepare.

02:24.978 --> 02:29.415
Yes, well, it's for a con man, which
I don't think you know anything about.

02:29.516 --> 02:32.110
And besides, don't you have school?

02:32.218 --> 02:37.121
No. Um- [Chuckles] Today is
"Help Your Dad Follow His Dream" day.

02:37.223 --> 02:40.750
Great. We can take the carpool lane.

02:40.860 --> 02:43.852
- I need ice.
- I'm glad Sitwell's coming over.

02:43.963 --> 02:47.023
<i>Let him see that</i>
<i>we're doing fine as a family.</i>

02:47.133 --> 02:49.761
<i>The only help we need</i>
<i>is from each other.</i>

02:49.869 --> 02:52.497
- And apparently whatever's in that bottle.
- Thanks for reminding me.

02:52.605 --> 02:55.199
- My Teamocil.
- Wait a minute. Teamocil?

02:55.308 --> 02:58.800
Isn't that that supplement that you and Tobias
were hocking before the F.D.A. Shut you down?

02:58.912 --> 03:02.040
<i>[Narrator] In the mid '90s,</i>
<i>Tobias formed a folk band...</i>

03:02.148 --> 03:04.981
<i>to promote a supplement</i>
<i>that promised better unity and teamwork.</i>

03:05.084 --> 03:09.282
- [Together] Teamocil
- Teamocil may decrease your sex drive.

03:09.389 --> 03:12.051
- Teamocil
- Good job, buddy.
- Thanks, friend.

03:12.158 --> 03:15.685
Since I've been taking this again, I've been
getting along great with my husband.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.763
You're taking it for the side effect,
aren't you?

03:17.864 --> 03:19.331
- <i>Michael.</i>
- Oh God.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.400
Mother, not a good time.
I'm having a meeting here.

03:21.501 --> 03:24.299
- Look at what Buster sent from the army.
- It's blacked out.

03:24.404 --> 03:26.395
Oh, the government.
Keep reading.

03:26.506 --> 03:29.304
"Sergeant Blank is
treating me very blank...

03:29.409 --> 03:32.378
"and it looks like I'll be shipping off
to blank in about a blank.

03:32.478 --> 03:35.641
- I blank you, Mother. Buster."
- I've done everything I can.

03:35.748 --> 03:38.046
I even tried to convince them he's gay,
but no one would believe...

03:38.151 --> 03:40.176
that a woman like me
would have a gay son.

03:40.286 --> 03:43.084
Well, you certainly tried. You guys wore
matching outfits till he was 12.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.089
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Even once on a magazine cover...</i>

03:45.191 --> 03:47.853
<i>that had been mocked</i>
<i>within the family for years.</i>

03:47.961 --> 03:52.193
Lucille, l-I'll say it again. You never know
what's going to happen in the army.

03:52.298 --> 03:56.860
- Remember, Lucille?
- No, I don't.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.939
- Get me a vodka, rocks.
- Mom, it's breakfast.

04:00.039 --> 04:02.837
- And a piece of toast.
- Please, Stan Sitwell's coming over.

04:02.942 --> 04:06.708
<i>That hairless freak is coming here?</i>
<i>None ofhis hair is real, you know.</i>

04:06.813 --> 04:10.840
You mean the guy we're meeting with
can't even grow his own hair? Come on!

04:10.950 --> 04:14.579
It's called alopecia, and I'd appreciate it
if we could all be sensitive to it, okay?

04:14.687 --> 04:18.281
- He happens to be
a very modest and generous man.
- <i>[Lucille] Modest and generous?</i>

04:18.391 --> 04:21.360
Then why is he always waving giant
$10 million checks over his head...

04:21.461 --> 04:24.919
- every time some-
- Go ahead, Mom. Finish your thought.

04:25.031 --> 04:28.057
"Every time some children's
hospital needs funding"?

04:28.167 --> 04:31.625
Nonetheless, we could get
a giant checkbook too.

04:31.738 --> 04:34.138
We're just not
that starved for attention.

04:35.908 --> 04:38.206
<i>[Narrator] And later, Sitwell</i>
<i>laid out his plans.</i>

04:38.311 --> 04:41.144
- Sorry that my son couldn't be here-
- Let me guess. Girlfriend.

04:41.247 --> 04:46.048
You know, it could be worse. He could
wanna marry your mother. [Laughs]

04:46.152 --> 04:48.586
Oh, I'm sorry. Is your family not
laughing at that yet?

04:48.688 --> 04:50.315
Okay. Let me tell you
what I'm offering.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.721
You got a wonderful piece of property
here that's going nowhere.

04:52.825 --> 04:55.623
So what I propose is a co-venture
with your Sudden Valley Development.

04:55.728 --> 04:58.356
The first thing you might
wanna change though is the name.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.433
You know, Sudden Valley conjures up
the image of a sinkhole, no?

05:01.534 --> 05:04.332
I told that to Dad.
I told that to my dad.

05:04.437 --> 05:07.531
<i>I'm thinking</i>- <i>Paradise Gardens.</i>

05:07.640 --> 05:11.269
- <i>[Wind Whistling]</i>
- I swear to God, I have that written-

05:11.377 --> 05:14.369
I want you to see so you don't think-
I have that written down in my notebook.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.448
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>When George Sr. Was in charge...</i>

05:16.549 --> 05:20.007
<i>he had a habit of shooting down</i>
<i>any idea Michael came up with.</i>

05:20.119 --> 05:24.749
And Sudden Valley just sort of implies that
something awful could happen all of a sudden.

05:24.857 --> 05:28.349
- Plus, it's on a hill.
- What are you taking, stupid pills? Come on.

05:28.461 --> 05:30.429
Save us some money.

05:30.530 --> 05:33.363
<i>[Narrator] This was a management tool</i>
<i>that he used to keep Michael...</i>

05:33.466 --> 05:37.027
- <i>working for his approval.</i>
- That was a hard one to say no to.

05:37.136 --> 05:39.764
The only thing I ask is
out of the 450 homes we build...

05:39.872 --> 05:42.363
one be given to a disadvantaged family
from the inner city.

05:42.475 --> 05:46.411
<i>That's great. So the other</i>
<i>449 families live in fear?</i>

05:46.512 --> 05:49.709
Is that what we're saying?
I mean, come on! Where's your decen-

05:49.816 --> 05:52.114
What the hell just fell off your face?

05:52.218 --> 05:55.210
- One of this guy's eyebrows fell in the candy beans.
- I always carry a spare.

05:55.321 --> 05:58.381
<i>Well, I hope you also carry a spare bowl</i>
<i>of candy beans.</i>

05:58.491 --> 06:00.482
Gob! I'm very impressed
with the offer.

06:00.593 --> 06:03.255
I'm gonna run it upstairs,
see what kind of reaction it gets.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.161
- Hmm?
- So to speak.

06:06.265 --> 06:09.757
- <i>[Narrator] Michael hoped to impress his father.</i>
- I think it sounds pretty good.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.861
Pretty good? It was horrible.
What are you taking, stupid pills again?

06:12.972 --> 06:16.066
<i>[Narrator] But their old dynamic</i>
<i>returned when George Sr. Did.</i>

06:16.175 --> 06:19.804
Gob was the only one down there
who knew how to handle that hairless freak.

06:19.912 --> 06:22.039
- Thank God we have Gob on our team.
- You know, Dad...

06:22.148 --> 06:24.946
Gob doesn't really do
all that much for our team.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.645
In fact, I think it's time
that I get put back in charge.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.154
Michael, listen to me.
Lately, your ideas, they're horrible.

06:30.256 --> 06:33.748
<i>And Sitwell's just trying to</i>
<i>figure out our batting order...</i>

06:33.860 --> 06:36.351
for the softball game
on Saturday, I'm telling you.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.953
Gob said the same thing, Dad,
but l-I doubt that this guy's...

06:39.065 --> 06:42.626
trying to drop $15 million
to find out our batting order.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.600
Hey. This game goes way, way back.

06:44.704 --> 06:47.832
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>It was a fierce rivalry, with George Sr. Using...</i>

06:47.940 --> 06:52.172
- <i>everything at his disposal to win</i>- 
- No hair. Hey, we got no hair.

06:52.278 --> 06:56.942
<i>While Stan Sitwell used the game</i>
<i>to raise funds for underprivileged children.</i>

06:57.049 --> 07:01.110
- Oh, I think one of your orphans
is heading towards the street.
- Strike three.

07:01.220 --> 07:04.018
You go down there, and you tell him
to go screw himself...

07:04.123 --> 07:05.522
and apologize to your brother.

07:05.625 --> 07:08.059
We need him on our side,
and we need him happy.

07:08.194 --> 07:10.492
- Where's Sitwell?
- Sorry. I told him to screw off.

07:10.596 --> 07:13.565
- But get this, he offered me a job.
- What?

07:13.666 --> 07:16.635
Well, I'm not waiting
on my brother. I pass.

07:16.736 --> 07:20.228
- You look surprised.
- I'm sorry. I must've put it on too high.

07:20.339 --> 07:23.968
But you were right. It was a bad offer
and you were smart enough not to take it.

07:24.076 --> 07:27.375
You got gumption. You speak your mind. That
means you're good enough to work for me.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.141
[Bleeps] you.

07:29.248 --> 07:31.876
And I accepted.
He's waiting for me outside.

07:31.984 --> 07:36.216
We're gonna swing by his wigmaker.
His "just woke up" hair is finally ready.

07:36.322 --> 07:38.586
You're really gonna do this?

07:38.691 --> 07:42.991
It's ready, Mike. They're only
gonna hold it for 24 hours.

07:43.095 --> 07:47.054
<i>[Narrator] Tobias and Maeby, meanwhile,</i>
<i>had mapped the route to the audition.</i>

07:47.166 --> 07:50.624
Well, here we are
and home we go...

07:50.736 --> 07:54.069
with plenty of time
to get you to English class.

07:54.173 --> 07:56.232
Wait. You can't do
a U-turn on your dream.

07:56.342 --> 08:00.142
I say, we get you on the lot and get
the Fünke name out there.

08:00.246 --> 08:03.704
- Start talking you up around the watercoolers.
- Maeby, we'll never get on here.

08:03.816 --> 08:07.343
I mean, behind these walls
are the biggest stars in the world.

08:07.453 --> 08:10.081
<i>America's treasures.</i>

08:12.558 --> 08:16.517
- Damn it!
- Dad, you're auditioning for the part
of a confidence man.

08:16.629 --> 08:18.358
Let's try a little confidence.

08:18.464 --> 08:21.058
You say confidence man?
Hey, I'm up for that part too.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.465
- Oh.
- Good luck to you.

08:23.569 --> 08:25.366
Good luck to you too.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.871
<i>[Narrator] As Tobias was gaining</i>
<i>self-confidence...</i>

08:27.974 --> 08:29.908
- <i>Michael was struggling to keep his.</i>
- Hi, Dad.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.705
- Wow, you're president again?
- Yes, this is the way it should be.

08:32.812 --> 08:35.474
What do you think of when you hear
the words, "Sudden Valley"?

08:35.581 --> 08:39.482
Salad dressing, I think. But for
some reason, I don't wanna eat it.

08:39.585 --> 08:44.488
- Right. But "Paradise Gardens."
- Yeah. Okay. I can see marinating a chicken in that.

08:44.590 --> 08:47.957
Um, I'm actually here about the softball game.
We need some girls on the team, right?

08:48.060 --> 08:49.891
Yes, we do.
That's a league requirement.

08:49.996 --> 08:52.897
<i>[Narrator] One that was difficult to meet,</i>
<i>given Gob's behavior...</i>

08:52.999 --> 08:55.331
<i>in the third inning</i>
<i>oflast year's game.</i>

08:55.434 --> 08:57.265
We could stay here,
wait for another pop-up.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.635
- <i>And in the fifth inning.</i>
- Come on! Yeah, here we go!

09:00.740 --> 09:03.072
- <i>Oh, and before the game.</i>
- [Cheering]

09:05.778 --> 09:08.747
We lost our entire outfield
and a couple of court cases.

09:08.848 --> 09:12.249
Well, you know who would be great
and not at all litigious is Ann.

09:12.351 --> 09:14.911
- [Inhales] Mmm, not Ann.
- No?

09:15.021 --> 09:18.821
'Cause you know this-this
game is kind of our thing.

09:18.925 --> 09:21.189
But Ann's amazing.
You know, she could play my position.

09:21.294 --> 09:25.162
You should be playing the field...
there, in right, you know?

09:25.264 --> 09:28.529
Plus, I got Aunt Lindsay playing this year.
I can't very well pull her off the roster.

09:28.634 --> 09:33.128
Let's make Ann the backup, okay? Very good
way to think about her... as a backup.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.036
- She's gonna be so excited.
- Good.

09:35.141 --> 09:38.941
- Maybe-Maybe now I'll get a kiss.
- Okay.

09:39.045 --> 09:43.209
Oh. I meant from Ann.

09:44.517 --> 09:47.452
Yes, I know.
I just want to get in there first.

09:47.553 --> 09:50.351
[Quietly]
Okay.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.390
Lindsay, wake up. I need you
to play on the softball team this year.

09:55.494 --> 09:58.622
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Lindsay felt the intended effect of Teamocil</i>- 

09:58.731 --> 10:02.360
- <i>a sense of camaraderie.</i>
- Count me in, Michael. Happy to help the team.

10:05.838 --> 10:08.466
- Great news. I'm back.
- You just left.

10:08.574 --> 10:10.701
Yeah, I don't think
things are gonna work out with Sitwell.

10:10.810 --> 10:13.779
<i>I mean, we picked up his sleepy-head wig,</i>
<i>everything was cool.</i>

10:13.879 --> 10:16.404
Next thing I know, he's asking me
for a bunch of work ideas.

10:16.515 --> 10:20.576
So, I thought I'd just quit
and go back to being president here.

10:20.686 --> 10:24.247
I need to do this job, okay?
I need to <i>prove</i> that I can do this job.

10:24.357 --> 10:28.987
- To who?
- To... you.

10:29.095 --> 10:33.156
Michael, I'm your big brother.
I'll never be impressed with you.

10:33.265 --> 10:35.233
- Still.
- Anyway, look. You can still do it.

10:35.334 --> 10:39.896
I just want the office
and my stuffs and title.

10:40.006 --> 10:45.171
What about... if I help you with
your work over at Sitwell?

10:45.277 --> 10:47.837
- You'd do that?
- Sure.

10:47.947 --> 10:50.381
You really want me
to succeed at Sitwell.

10:50.483 --> 10:56.115
Well, I just- Hey. Come on. I really want
you to be over at Sitwell.

11:00.726 --> 11:05.959
<i>[Narrator] Lucille was worried that her son</i>
<i>Buster was being sent into battle with the army.</i>

11:06.065 --> 11:09.193
I feel that we've not brought
something up that might be a solution...

11:09.301 --> 11:11.861
um, to spare my feelings.

11:11.971 --> 11:15.429
Send you in his place? I called.
They don't want you back.

11:15.541 --> 11:20.171
<i>[Narrator] Oscar had served in Vietnam</i>
<i>as a croc spotter on a Swift boat.</i>

11:20.279 --> 11:22.509
Croc! No, Sorry. Wait. Log.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.583
Just a log.
No, wait. Sorry. Croc!

11:24.684 --> 11:28.984
- <i>[Woman Singing "Downtown"]</i>
- <i>It was there that he met</i>
<i>a young U.S.O. Dancer named Lucille.</i>

11:29.088 --> 11:30.953
<i>[Young Lucille]</i>
<i>I prefer an older man.</i>

11:31.057 --> 11:35.653
- <i>[Bob Hope] Hey, I'm free after the show.</i>
- <i>I said older, Bob, not dead.</i>

11:37.496 --> 11:40.624
I swore I'd never
say his name again, but...

11:40.733 --> 11:43.395
it's time to call you-know-who.

11:43.502 --> 11:47.632
<i>[Narrator] "You-know-who"was</i>
<i>an army sergeant named Bill Anderson.</i>

11:47.740 --> 11:52.473
<i>He and Lucille were an item</i>
<i>before she left him for Oscar.</i>

11:52.578 --> 11:57.379
<i>At the studio, Tobias began to</i>
<i>create buzz around the watercooler.</i>

11:57.483 --> 11:59.474
That Fünke is some kind of something.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.849
Boy, this Fünke is all anybody's
ever talking about.

12:01.954 --> 12:05.287
So sick and tired of hearing about
how brilliant that Fünke is.

12:05.391 --> 12:09.452
Overrated.
I'll just move- I'm sorry.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.087
Okay. We're okay. Okay.

12:12.198 --> 12:15.827
<i>Meanwhile, Maeby looked for</i>
<i>an empty office to call George Michael.</i>

12:15.935 --> 12:20.031
Where are you? I bought you a day.
I can't put this book report off forever.

12:20.139 --> 12:22.334
<i>Sorry, is this your office?</i>

12:22.441 --> 12:25.968
No. I'm just sitting behind someone else's
desk pretending these are my kids.

12:26.078 --> 12:29.104
<i>Can you getJude Law</i>
<i>in here for a meeting?</i>

12:29.215 --> 12:31.274
- Oh, I'm just a reader.
- A reader?

12:31.383 --> 12:35.012
- Yeah.
- I need a report by tomorrow.

12:35.121 --> 12:39.751
<i>Before gym-lunch...</i>
<i>with Jim... Carrey.</i>

12:39.859 --> 12:42.123
It's the <i>Grinch</i> guy.
You're too young.

12:46.065 --> 12:49.865
So get this.
Sitwell loved my ideas.

12:49.969 --> 12:52.938
Well, my ideas and I knew it.
That's great.

12:53.038 --> 12:55.836
- You know, Dad never complimented any of those.
- Here's the thing.

12:55.941 --> 12:59.809
- I need <i>more.</i>
- There were 34 proposals in there.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.642
You'd be amazed how fast they come out
when you read them all in a row.

13:02.748 --> 13:06.878
"Thirty-one, bamboo floor upgrades.
Cheaper, stronger." I can't read this word.

13:06.986 --> 13:09.921
"Thirty-two, wireless 'crapability."'
That one explains itself.

13:10.022 --> 13:12.320
- "Thirty-three"-
- Gob, that was six-months' worth of work.

13:12.424 --> 13:14.392
- You can't just blurt them all out at once.
- <i>Mr. Bluth.</i>

13:14.493 --> 13:17.724
- He's coming. I've got to go.
- You blew them away.

13:17.830 --> 13:21.630
[Chuckles] Bought you something. Maybe
we can play catch sometime.

13:21.734 --> 13:25.033
<i>[Narrator] Gob's own father had only</i>
<i>once played catch with him.</i>

13:25.137 --> 13:29.233
<i>And it ended as badly</i>
<i>as any game of catch could end.</i>

13:29.341 --> 13:32.469
- White power!
- Better yet, maybe we can play ball on Saturday.

13:32.578 --> 13:35.547
I'll meet you there.
I've got a neck hair fitting at 11:00.

13:35.648 --> 13:40.608
<i>[Narrator] Gob was both angry...</i>
<i>and overwhelmed...</i>

13:40.719 --> 13:43.847
<i>by the approval</i>
<i>from this new father figure.</i>

13:43.956 --> 13:47.016
<i>It was confusing.</i>

13:47.126 --> 13:50.027
<i>Michael was less torn</i>
<i>and went to brag to his father.</i>

13:50.129 --> 13:54.862
So, apparently my ideas aren't so bad,
and that comes from Sitwell himself.

13:54.967 --> 13:58.698
- You let your ideas go to Sitwell?
- Uh, no. I gave them to Gob...

13:58.804 --> 14:02.535
who, uh, works there now.

14:02.641 --> 14:04.609
You let Gob go to Sitwell?

14:04.710 --> 14:07.008
- What'd I tell you? I told you-
- "Don't let him go." I know.

14:07.112 --> 14:10.047
- But my point is that I do all the work, Pop.
- He makes all the plays.

14:10.149 --> 14:12.481
Don't you understand? He was the best
softball player in the league.

14:12.585 --> 14:17.716
<i>[Narrator] Gob was especially gifted</i>
<i>at sacrificing his body for the play.</i>

14:17.823 --> 14:20.951
- <i>Play's at second. Play's at second.</i>
- Yeah! Suck on that, Sitwell.

14:21.060 --> 14:23.551
<i>Although at times,</i>
<i>even that wasn't enough.</i>

14:23.662 --> 14:26.495
Your Tweety Bird dance
just cost us a run, you moron.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.829
<i>[George] Why do you think</i>
<i>Sitwell hired him?</i>

14:28.934 --> 14:32.301
You can't do this. You're gonna lose the game,
the company, and you can't do this.

14:32.404 --> 14:35.396
What are you saying? If I win the game,
you're comfortable with me running the company?

14:35.507 --> 14:37.634
- That's what I'm saying.
- I'll win the game.

14:37.776 --> 14:41.007
And I'll show him that
his little plan didn't work, all right?

14:41.113 --> 14:44.742
- We can build houses. We can win games.
- That is what I wanna hear.

14:44.850 --> 14:48.911
- <i>[Clattering]</i>
- We can win games.

14:50.522 --> 14:54.424
Lindsay, did that oven vent hit you?
Your foot is bleeding.

14:54.526 --> 14:58.121
- My foot is bleeding.
- <i>[Narrator] Teamocil may cause</i>
<i>numbness of the extremities.</i>

14:58.230 --> 15:00.198
You're gonna be able
to play on our team, right?

15:00.299 --> 15:03.598
- Why do you think I'm taking Teamocil?
- To curb your sex drive.

15:03.702 --> 15:05.602
That's right. What team
are you talking about?

15:05.704 --> 15:09.299
<i>[Narrator] It may also cause</i>
<i>short-term memory loss.</i>

15:09.408 --> 15:12.104
<i>Okay. Looks like I'm gonna need</i>
<i>that female backup player after all.</i>

15:12.211 --> 15:15.146
- And Ann's really good at softball, huh?
- <i>Yeah. She's amazing.</i>

15:15.247 --> 15:17.841
You know, she's got this low center
of gravity. You can't knock her over.

15:17.950 --> 15:20.680
- Well, <i>I</i> could knock her over.
- Dad, I'm telling you, you can't.

15:20.786 --> 15:23.016
<i>They call her "The Wall,"</i>
<i>you know?</i>

15:23.122 --> 15:27.286
Well, that's great. But I could
knock her over. I won't, but I could.

15:27.393 --> 15:30.021
- <i>[Narrator] And Lucille called on an old lover.</i>
- William?

15:30.129 --> 15:32.563
- Yes, ma'am?
- You don't remember me?

15:32.665 --> 15:36.795
<i>[Narrator] General Anderson had done</i>
<i>three tours of duty in Vietnam...</i>

15:36.902 --> 15:41.862
- <i>but the only memory he'd blocked</i>
<i>was being left by Lucille.</i>
- Oh, God. That touch.

15:41.974 --> 15:45.842
- Oh, how could I forget? Pat?
- Lucille.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.812
I could never forget that touch.

15:48.914 --> 15:52.645
Bill, they're shipping my son Buster off.
I can't have that happen.

15:52.751 --> 15:57.051
- I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.
- Is there anything I can do?

15:58.357 --> 16:03.420
Maybe if you... go downtown.

16:03.529 --> 16:07.397
[Exhales]
Oh, I haven't done that in 30 years.

<i>[Narrator] And so, Buster was pulled out</i>
<i>of combat training</i>- 

16:23.615 --> 16:28.177
- Put 'em down and halt!
- <i>and put into U.S.O. Training.</i>

- It jolts, but it's not really doing it right now.
<i>- And back at Gob's new office.</i>

16:35.627 --> 16:37.424
- Michael.
- Do you still need those ideas?

16:37.529 --> 16:40.362
<i>Come on. Are you kidding me?</i>
<i>I can't let Sitwell down.</i>

16:40.466 --> 16:44.027
- L-I'm desperate here.
- Then I'll make you a deal.

16:44.136 --> 16:48.129
- I want you to throw the softball game.
- Never!

16:48.240 --> 16:50.902
- He gave me this.
- Course he did. Why do you think he hired you?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.877
He liked my ideas.

16:53.979 --> 16:55.879
They were my ideas,
and, no, he didn't.

16:55.981 --> 16:59.712
He wants you for the softball game because
he's trying to make our family look foolish.

16:59.818 --> 17:04.653
I knew you had bad ideas.
All right, we'll play <i>him.</i>

17:04.757 --> 17:07.385
I'll throw that softball game.

17:07.492 --> 17:10.723
Nobody makes a fool of
our family without my help.

17:17.102 --> 17:21.334
<i>[Narrator] Tobias had talked up the name</i>
<i>Fünke, and it was time to audition.</i>

17:21.440 --> 17:24.170
- What's your name?
- Tobias.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.300
He's too short. Give it to the guard.

17:26.412 --> 17:31.748
Oh. L- I'm not. L-
On camera, I seem much taller.

17:31.850 --> 17:35.149
<i>And Maeby picked up the reader's report,</i>
<i>which had now become her book report.</i>

17:35.254 --> 17:37.950
- Whatcha got there?
- I can't really discuss it.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.457
If you wanna get it made,
I'm the guy who has to see it.

17:40.559 --> 17:44.188
You're the Fünke everyone's talking about?
What are you, like, 15?

17:44.296 --> 17:48.164
- Marry me. [Chuckles]
- Everyone thinks I look young too.

17:48.267 --> 17:51.259
- So who are you thinking about?
- Jude Law. Why do you ask?

17:51.370 --> 17:53.838
Yeah. Go young <i>. Young Guy and the Sea.</i>
Big spring-breaker.

17:53.939 --> 17:56.931
Four C.G.I. The fish.
Let's fast-track this one.

17:57.042 --> 18:00.443
<i>[Narrator] And that's when Maeby realized</i>
<i>she had become a successful film executive.</i>

18:00.546 --> 18:02.707

18:02.815 --> 18:05.807
- I need something. Ajob for my dad.
- Yeah, yeah. Sure. Okay.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.285
Listen to me.
Brand new cars don't get waxed!

18:09.388 --> 18:11.856
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>That afternoon it was game time...</i>

18:11.957 --> 18:14.448
<i>and Michael felt confident</i>
<i>about a Bluth win.</i>

Spin, spin, spin.

18:19.298 --> 18:24.031
<i>[Narrator] Ann wasn't as amazing as</i>
<i>George Michael led his father to believe.</i>

18:25.104 --> 18:27.299
<i>But Gob was playing</i>
<i>worse than ever...</i>

18:27.406 --> 18:30.307
<i>as per his agreement with Michael.</i>

18:37.749 --> 18:41.082
<i>Your guy can't hit, Sitwell.</i>
<i>He's never gonna touch it.</i>

18:41.186 --> 18:43.245
- Time out.
- Time out.

18:43.355 --> 18:45.482
Gob, are you okay?

18:45.591 --> 18:48.389
Yeah, just can't hit today.
Guess you're really disappointed in me.

18:48.494 --> 18:51.657
Hey. Everybody has days like this.
It's only a game.

18:51.763 --> 18:54.823
After that list of ideas you gave me,
I don't care if you blow the whole season.

18:54.933 --> 18:57.663
Come here, you.

18:59.071 --> 19:00.834
Okay. We're good.

19:00.939 --> 19:04.898
<i>[Narrator] And Gob finally felt</i>
<i>that someone believed in him.</i>

19:05.010 --> 19:08.673
<i>Even though they weren't his ideas.</i>

19:08.780 --> 19:11.408
<i>And he decided</i>
<i>to make Sitwell proud.</i>

19:14.553 --> 19:16.680
<i>[Michael]</i>
<i>Get on that ball!</i>

19:19.024 --> 19:21.515
You go!

19:21.627 --> 19:23.527
You better pull an ankle or something.

19:23.629 --> 19:25.529
<i>Come on, George Michael!</i>
<i>Get that ball in there!</i>

19:25.631 --> 19:27.690
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Then he went headfirst into The Wall.</i>

19:27.799 --> 19:29.767
- I'm safe.
- You're out!

19:29.868 --> 19:33.201
<i>Out? I was safe! I'm safe!</i>

19:33.305 --> 19:36.365
- Stop with the Tweety Bird dance, you moron.
- Dad?

19:36.475 --> 19:38.807
He made the call. You're out.
What are you doing?

19:38.911 --> 19:40.708
- Shush, shush, shush.
- Dad?

19:40.812 --> 19:43.212
- He's safe.
- What the hell are you doing here?

19:43.315 --> 19:46.409
I'm taking care of what you
screwed up. You blew it again, Michael.

19:46.518 --> 19:50.887
Let me tell you something. I blew it when
I let you start controlling me again.

19:50.989 --> 19:52.889
I even stooped to cheat here
at a softball game.

19:52.991 --> 19:55.391
You've been talking to each other.
How come nobody called me?

19:55.494 --> 19:58.793
- What's going on there?
- I'm just fixing something that's been bugging me.

19:58.897 --> 20:01.491
- <i>He was safe.</i>
- [Cheering]

20:01.600 --> 20:05.229
He was. We lost.
Get over it.

20:05.337 --> 20:08.829
Yeah, and Stan Sitwell liked my ideas.
He really believed in me.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.738
- My ideas.
- Well.

20:10.842 --> 20:13.743
And I'm president, whether
you like it or not, Dad.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.972
I don't need your approval anymore.

20:17.549 --> 20:20.848
- I'm proud of you.
- Really?

20:20.953 --> 20:23.046
Yeah. See ya.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.583
Michael, I could've sworn
I just saw Dad.

20:28.694 --> 20:32.095
Or not. I think hallucination
is one of the side-effects ofTeamocil.

20:32.197 --> 20:34.324
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>It isn't.</i>

20:34.433 --> 20:36.731
- Thanks for making the right call there, Mike.
- Yeah.

20:36.835 --> 20:39.963
- Sorry I didn't blow the game.
- No. You did the right thing...

20:40.072 --> 20:42.632
and you finally got Dad
to one of your ball games.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.369
- Screw him.
- Yeah.
