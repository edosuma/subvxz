00:09.330 --> 00:11.390
Rolling out the red carpet?

00:11.430 --> 00:14.290
It's about time I got the
respect I deserve around here.

00:16.160 --> 00:17.330
It's not for you, doof!

00:19.330 --> 00:20.130
It's for a celebrity.

00:20.170 --> 00:22.370
Sequoia is coming to our school.

00:23.340 --> 00:25.200
Sequoia?

00:25.240 --> 00:27.410
She's my favorite movie star!

00:27.440 --> 00:30.110
Why is she coming here?

00:30.140 --> 00:32.280
Ooh! Maybe she's going to unite
two warring dance crews,

00:32.310 --> 00:36.350
like she did in
<i>Give Peace a Dance.</i>

00:36.380 --> 00:38.350
That's ridiculous.
Our dance crews get along great.

00:43.350 --> 00:45.290
We want Sequoia to get the star treatment.

00:45.320 --> 00:50.120
So we're making sure she walks on
a red carpet wherever she goes.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.260
You don't have enough carpet
to cover the whole school.

00:51.290 --> 00:53.430
What if she needs to go to the gym?

00:53.460 --> 00:56.260
If she wants to exercise, we have this.

01:02.370 --> 01:04.269
I don't exercise.

01:04.300 --> 01:06.130
I have people who do that for me.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.010
I can't believe it!

01:15.050 --> 01:16.310
Sequoia! Wow!

01:18.180 --> 01:19.650
You're even taller in person!

01:19.680 --> 01:24.320
Which is weird, because on the movie
screen, you're like 20 feet tall.

01:24.350 --> 01:27.120
Although sometimes I do watch
your movies on my phone,

01:27.160 --> 01:28.290
and then you're only two inches tall,

01:28.320 --> 01:31.160
so I guess it averages out.

01:31.190 --> 01:33.060
That is enough exercise for today.

01:33.090 --> 01:35.100
I am exhausted.

02:31.450 --> 02:34.110
So, Sequoia, what are you doing here?

02:36.080 --> 02:38.050
I'm researching a role.

02:38.090 --> 02:42.260
My next movie is about a child prodigy.

02:42.290 --> 02:45.060
Finally someone's doing a movie about me.

02:46.390 --> 02:49.130
I can teach you everything I know.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.230
Well, not everything,

02:50.260 --> 02:53.430
because no one alive has my brain capacity.

02:55.170 --> 02:56.170
Or my cheek bones.

02:59.340 --> 03:03.140
Actually, the movie is
about a musical prodigy.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.280
Boring!

03:08.020 --> 03:10.220
Wait a second!
I'm a musical prodigy!

03:12.220 --> 03:13.320
Perfect.
So, if you don't mind,

03:13.350 --> 03:17.020
I'd love to watch your every move.

03:17.060 --> 03:19.030
Fletcher already does that.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.360
I do not!

03:28.170 --> 03:29.240
I'm just

03:30.170 --> 03:32.210
bird watching.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.110
I'm going to go try outside.
Maybe I'll have better luck.

03:38.280 --> 03:41.080
This is the perfect week to follow me.

03:41.120 --> 03:46.120
I'm performing at Cabaret Night on Friday.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.190
Great. Until then, I just
won't leave your side.

03:48.220 --> 03:52.160
Yay! This is going
to be so much fun!

03:52.200 --> 03:54.300
Yay! This is going
to be so much fun!

03:56.430 --> 03:59.130
Oh, this isn't going to be annoying at all.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.280
You know, I'm proficient
with 37 instruments,

04:10.310 --> 04:15.180
so people love it when I stroll
through the cafeteria playing music.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.089
Shut up!

04:26.160 --> 04:27.360
Uh...

04:27.390 --> 04:30.360
Sometimes people like
to shout out requests.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.030
The "Shut Up Polka" it is!

04:36.140 --> 04:37.170
Shut up!

04:41.410 --> 04:44.240
Look at Chyna.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.010
"Ooh, I'm friends with a movie star!

04:47.050 --> 04:50.080
"So I'm too cool to sit with
Olive and that idiot Angus!"

04:52.420 --> 04:54.020
She's not saying that.

04:54.050 --> 04:54.090
Oh, she's saying that.

04:59.290 --> 05:01.230
What are you doing?

05:01.260 --> 05:04.130
Oh, just studying
the way that you eat pizza.

05:04.160 --> 05:08.070
Okay.
"Pointy end first."

05:08.100 --> 05:09.240
This is good stuff.

05:20.050 --> 05:22.010
Is this a Stinkle doll?

05:22.420 --> 05:25.220
What? No.

05:25.250 --> 05:26.350
The Stinkles is a little kids' show.

05:26.390 --> 05:29.320
This is

05:29.360 --> 05:30.120
my manly deodorant.

05:40.270 --> 05:43.300
No, that's Strawberry Stinkle!

05:43.340 --> 05:45.140
I'd recognize her anywhere!

05:46.310 --> 05:48.140
I mean, nowhere.

05:48.410 --> 05:50.140
What's a Stinkle?

05:51.410 --> 05:53.150
Who am I?

05:54.150 --> 05:55.250
Where am I?

05:56.280 --> 05:57.320
I gotta go.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.660
You're a fan of the Stinkles!

06:00.690 --> 06:04.160
Are you going to see the live
action Stinkles movie on Friday?

06:04.190 --> 06:05.290
The one opening tomorrow?

06:05.330 --> 06:07.190
Please!
I wouldn't be caught dead

06:07.230 --> 06:11.200
at the Pan-Pacific Theater
at 3, 5, 7:15 or 9:30.

06:13.070 --> 06:15.000
Great! We can go to
the Stinkles movie together!

06:16.000 --> 06:18.140
Shh! Shut up!

06:18.170 --> 06:20.270
Okay! One more time!

06:22.340 --> 06:24.380
Shut up!

06:32.020 --> 06:34.060
Opens door using door knob.

06:38.130 --> 06:41.360
Makes puzzled look by furrowing brow.
This is good stuff!

06:44.130 --> 06:46.000
Olive, what are you doing?

06:46.040 --> 06:48.070
I'm following you to do research.

06:48.100 --> 06:50.040
I'm writing a movie about a girl
who abandons her best friend

06:50.070 --> 06:52.310
to hang out with a celebrity.

06:52.340 --> 06:55.280
Everyone wants to do a movie about me!

06:56.050 --> 07:00.250
I'm having the best day!

07:00.280 --> 07:03.020
You're missing the point!
I'm mad at you!

07:03.050 --> 07:04.290
You completely ignored me at lunch!

07:04.320 --> 07:10.330
Come on. How often do I get to
hang out with a movie star?

07:10.360 --> 07:13.260
Look, I'm sorry I didn't
have lunch with you today.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.100
I wish I could have,

07:15.130 --> 07:16.960
but unfortunately there's only one of me.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.170
Chyna's right.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.000
There's only one of us.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.150
Fine. I don't need you.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.990
I'll just hang out with this idiot Angus.

07:41.020 --> 07:42.360
I don't know why
she keeps calling you that.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.100
How can Pomegranate
Stinkle be your favorite?

07:53.070 --> 07:55.000
He's so full of himself!

07:55.040 --> 07:57.140
"Ooh, I'm an antioxidant!"

08:02.240 --> 08:03.340
Hey, there's Lexi.

08:03.380 --> 08:05.010
Hey, Lexi!
It's Fletcher, from school!

08:05.050 --> 08:08.210
Shh! What are you doing?

08:08.250 --> 08:11.120
We can't let anyone know we're
going to a little kids' movie.

08:11.150 --> 08:12.250
We'll never hear the end of it.

08:14.220 --> 08:15.290
Hey.

08:18.330 --> 08:19.330
Are you guys okay?

08:20.400 --> 08:23.260
Yes. We're just

08:23.300 --> 08:25.100
hugging ourselves.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.240
It's a little
self-esteem booster.

08:28.270 --> 08:33.010
I'm a good person.
I'm a good person.

08:33.039 --> 08:35.179
You know what
raises my self-esteem?

08:35.210 --> 08:37.049
Being beautiful.

08:40.049 --> 08:42.020
So what movie are you guys here to see?

08:42.049 --> 08:43.390
Uh...

08:49.290 --> 08:54.160
It's a remake of "Please silence
your pager in the theater."

08:54.200 --> 08:55.330
Well, I'm here to see
that new horror movie,

08:55.370 --> 09:00.140
<i>Hemorrhage II:</i>
<i>Revenge of the Hemo-Goblin.</i>

09:00.170 --> 09:03.270
You're going to the movie by yourself?

09:03.310 --> 09:07.140
Yeah. Everyone else
at school was too scared.

09:07.180 --> 09:10.310
Well, not us.
That's why we're here.

09:11.110 --> 09:12.280
It is?

09:12.320 --> 09:15.120
I mean, it is.

09:15.150 --> 09:16.250
Sometimes I add question marks to

09:16.290 --> 09:18.190
statements that don't really need it?

09:20.220 --> 09:21.990
Great.
We can see it together.

09:24.090 --> 09:27.160
One teen and two children for
<i>Hemorrhage </i> please.

09:35.370 --> 09:38.010
Chyna, can I sleep in your room tonight?

09:38.040 --> 09:40.210
I saw this really scary movie

09:40.240 --> 09:42.210
and now I think the
Hemo-Goblin is after me!

09:44.110 --> 09:46.250
Cameron, there's nothing to be afraid of.

09:48.180 --> 09:50.050
Hi, Chyna.

09:53.220 --> 09:54.350
What's the matter?
Is everything okay?

09:54.390 --> 09:56.020
Dad. Look.

09:58.190 --> 10:00.060
I know.
Weird, right?

10:00.090 --> 10:01.230
It's Sequoia!

10:01.260 --> 10:04.360
Sequoia is in our house!
Sequoia is in our...

10:16.060 --> 10:18.060
Olive, I need to talk to you about Sequoia.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.100
I don't want to talk to you about Sequoia.

10:20.130 --> 10:22.070
I don't even want to talk
to you about sequoia trees.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.070
Which are among the largest
coniferous trees in the world,

10:23.100 --> 10:26.870
the tallest of which
measures 115.61 meters.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.180
You don't understand.

10:30.210 --> 10:33.010
Look, I know she's researching a role,

10:33.050 --> 10:34.950
but I think Sequoia
is trying to steal my life!

10:36.120 --> 10:38.820
Why would she steal your life?

10:38.850 --> 10:40.890
Her life is way better than yours.

10:42.190 --> 10:46.090
Anyway, I'm staying as far away
as possible from that kook.

10:46.130 --> 10:48.890
I'm glad you've finally
come to your senses.

10:48.930 --> 10:50.830
Who cares about hanging around celebrities?

10:50.860 --> 10:52.830
They're no better than we are.

10:52.870 --> 10:55.130
Hey, Olive.
Want to have lunch together?

10:55.170 --> 10:57.200
Me? Sequoia wants
to have lunch with me?

10:59.010 --> 11:01.010
Where do you want to go, Sequoia?

11:01.040 --> 11:02.940
I'd prefer if you called me Chyna.

11:02.980 --> 11:04.040
Okay. Where do you
want to go, Chyna?

11:05.810 --> 11:07.780
Olive, what are you doing?

11:07.810 --> 11:09.920
Don't call her that.
She's not Chyna, I'm Chyna.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.850
You know what?
She's right.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.020
There can't be two Chynas.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.090
Thank you.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.790
So it might be easier if you went by
a different name for a little while.

11:19.830 --> 11:21.060
Ooh, how about Albert?

11:22.830 --> 11:24.160
I like that.
Very distinguished.

11:24.200 --> 11:24.230
What? No. I do not...

11:27.200 --> 11:30.070
Can we talk about this later, Albert?
Chyna's waiting for me.

11:38.910 --> 11:39.980
You're late.

11:40.010 --> 11:41.850
And who are these kids?

11:41.880 --> 11:42.950
Orphans.
If anyone spots us,

11:42.980 --> 11:45.980
they'll think we're just doing a good deed,

11:46.020 --> 11:48.880
taking these orphans
to see the Stinkles movie.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.890
That's so cool the orphanage
let you borrow these kids.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.060
We're going to have so much fun.

11:53.090 --> 11:55.990
Yeah, there's nothing I'd rather do

11:56.030 --> 11:59.000
than see some stupid movie
with you two fart clowns.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.100
Cameron? Fletcher?

12:03.140 --> 12:05.100
What are you guys doing back?

12:05.140 --> 12:08.910
We're taking these sweet, adorable
orphans to see the Stinkles movie.

12:08.940 --> 12:12.810
We don't want to see
that stupid baby movie,

12:12.850 --> 12:13.980
but we love these kids.

12:14.010 --> 12:17.950
You better buy me a large
popcorn, Daddy Warbucks.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.890
What are you doing back?

12:22.920 --> 12:24.120
I came to see <i>Hemorrhage II</i> again.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.960
This time in 3-D.

12:25.990 --> 12:28.190
So the Hemo-Goblin
will be right in my face!

12:30.160 --> 12:32.000
I think I just Stinkled my pants.

12:34.130 --> 12:37.040
<i>Hemorrhage II?</i>
<i>Awesome!</i>

12:37.070 --> 12:39.170
Let's see that instead.

12:39.210 --> 12:41.870
I don't think that's such a good idea.

12:41.910 --> 12:43.210
You guys might be scared.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.910
You guys.

12:45.910 --> 12:47.850
We're seeing that movie,

12:47.880 --> 12:49.950
or I will mess you up!

12:52.180 --> 12:55.120
Nine tickets to
<i>Hemorrhage II,</i> please.

13:00.190 --> 13:02.160
Look, I know you didn't want me to come,

13:02.190 --> 13:04.130
but I promise I won't embarrass you.

13:05.900 --> 13:06.960
Hey! My little girl's
performing tonight!

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
She has the voice of an angel!

13:10.030 --> 13:11.970
Let me tell you about the
first time she ever sang!

13:12.000 --> 13:14.810
I was changing her diaper.
She was three months old!

13:20.810 --> 13:21.970
Huh. Where's my guitar?

13:21.970 --> 13:22.850
Huh. Where's my guitar?

13:23.980 --> 13:28.050
I think you mean where's my guitar.

13:29.820 --> 13:31.120
I need that.
It's time for my performance.

13:31.160 --> 13:35.830
I think you mean it's
time for my performance.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.100
My goodness, you're bonkers.

13:39.130 --> 13:41.100
I think you mean my goodness,

13:41.130 --> 13:43.200
I'm bonkers.

13:44.970 --> 13:46.800
Give me this!
No! This is mine!

13:46.840 --> 13:48.010
I am trying to borrow it.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.810
Give this here!
Let it go!

13:49.840 --> 13:49.940
Okay.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.950
What happened?

13:58.980 --> 14:01.990
And why is everything upside down?

14:02.020 --> 14:03.020
You're the only thing that's upside down.

14:03.050 --> 14:06.790
If everything was upside down,

14:06.820 --> 14:07.860
then the sharks would fall out of the tank.

14:09.830 --> 14:10.990
Sharks?

14:11.900 --> 14:14.130
Help! Help!

14:14.160 --> 14:16.900
This will make you shut up.

14:18.870 --> 14:19.870
Shut up!

14:23.010 --> 14:25.970
Wow, the Shut Up Polka
has gotten really popular.

14:28.180 --> 14:29.780
No! No, no, no!

14:54.300 --> 14:56.000
Sequoia, have you seen Chyna?

14:56.040 --> 14:58.100
I am Chyna.

14:58.140 --> 15:01.110
I mean Albert.
Have you seen Albert?

15:01.140 --> 15:05.010
Oh, Albert couldn't make it, so
she asked me to fill in for her.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.950
What do you mean she couldn't make it?
Why not?

15:06.980 --> 15:09.880
She got suspended.

15:17.260 --> 15:19.190
What are you doing?

15:19.230 --> 15:21.960
I didn't want her to know
I didn't get her joke.

15:26.130 --> 15:28.270
I don't really want to see
this little kids' movie,

15:28.300 --> 15:32.170
but I'll do anything for
this little bundle of joy.

15:32.210 --> 15:36.140
Thank you. You're the bestest
daddy in the whole wide world.

15:37.350 --> 15:40.220
Watch it, you stupid baby!

15:41.220 --> 15:44.090
Lexi?

15:44.120 --> 15:46.290
No, I'm Strawberry Stinkle.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.020
You're a very cute baby.

15:51.160 --> 15:54.230
Give it up.
You're not fooling anyone.

15:54.270 --> 15:58.200
Uh, look!
My baby's taking his first steps!

15:58.240 --> 16:00.300
Too bad his mother's not here to see this.

16:00.340 --> 16:03.070
Unfortunately, she's doing a
pictorial for a swimsuit magazine.

16:05.940 --> 16:07.010
Lexi, I know you're in there!

16:12.210 --> 16:13.250
Stop it!

16:23.130 --> 16:24.290
All right, all right, it's me!

16:24.330 --> 16:28.100
I've been trying to see
the Stinkles movie all week.

16:28.130 --> 16:30.170
You guys were here to see the horror movie.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.900
I couldn't look less cool than you.

16:32.940 --> 16:34.270
We're here to see the Stinkles, too!

16:36.110 --> 16:38.940
This little rascal insisted.

16:38.980 --> 16:42.150
To think I'm missing
a round of golf for this.

16:42.180 --> 16:44.110
Why don't we all see the movie together?

16:44.150 --> 16:45.020
Okay. Why not?

16:48.320 --> 16:50.290
All right,

16:50.320 --> 16:53.290
but since I'll be bored by this
children's film, I'll just...

16:53.320 --> 16:54.960
I'll do my taxes.

17:09.140 --> 17:10.940
What the heck!

17:10.970 --> 17:13.280
Oh, "suspended."
Now I get the joke.

17:19.920 --> 17:23.119
You were She's off her rocker!

17:28.130 --> 17:30.990
Wait a minute.
Are those sharks?

17:31.030 --> 17:33.300
Awesome!

17:33.330 --> 17:35.970
Technically, they're oceanic white tips.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.940
You can tell by their long,
wing-like pectoral and dorsal fins.

17:42.140 --> 17:43.270
That's fascinating.

17:43.310 --> 17:45.240
What can you tell us about their diet?

17:45.270 --> 17:47.210
Do they like their food
suspended over a tank

17:47.240 --> 17:49.040
by a rapidly fraying rope?

17:51.210 --> 17:52.950
Olive, hurry!
Do something!

17:53.280 --> 17:55.250
I've got it!

17:55.280 --> 17:57.080
Dolphins have been known to protect
humans from shark attacks!

17:57.120 --> 17:59.020
We just need a dolphin!

17:59.050 --> 18:01.290
Okay, here's a website where
you can order dolphins online.

18:03.260 --> 18:06.090
If I spend $5 more, I get free shipping.

18:07.960 --> 18:10.000
You guys need anything?

18:14.100 --> 18:17.040
Ooh, I can add
an umbrella for $6.99.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.910
Chyna!

18:20.240 --> 18:21.980
Olive, that was amazing!

18:22.010 --> 18:26.920
You dove into the tank, punched
out a shark, and saved my life!

18:26.950 --> 18:29.220
And best of all, you kept my hair dry!

18:29.250 --> 18:31.090
Well, you do have a performance.

18:32.220 --> 18:33.120
I'm sorry I let Sequoia come between us.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.890
Me, too.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.890
I got caught up in celebrity.

18:37.930 --> 18:40.190
It made me feel important.

18:40.230 --> 18:41.100
But it's not.

18:41.130 --> 18:43.260
What's really important is our friendship.

18:43.300 --> 18:46.130
I feel the same way.

18:47.070 --> 18:48.970
Can I put you down now?

18:49.010 --> 18:50.070
You're heavier than you look.

18:57.180 --> 19:01.090
Thank you.
My name is Chyna Parks.

19:02.050 --> 19:02.990
You're not Chyna Parks.

19:03.020 --> 19:05.920
You're Sequoia!
I love you, Sequoia!

19:12.930 --> 19:15.000
Stop! This girl
is an impostor!

19:16.270 --> 19:18.870
She dangled me over a tank of sharks!

19:18.910 --> 19:20.040
She tried to kill me!

19:23.140 --> 19:24.940
Why are you laughing?

19:24.980 --> 19:26.180
Don't laugh at me like I'm the wacko!

19:26.210 --> 19:26.910
She's the wacko!

19:26.950 --> 19:29.150
Follow me and I'll prove it!

19:29.180 --> 19:32.220
No, follow me and I'll prove it.

19:32.250 --> 19:33.990
You're getting on my last nerve.

19:38.930 --> 19:40.990
See? A shark tank!

19:41.030 --> 19:42.090
Dad, Dad, be careful!

19:42.130 --> 19:45.200
There are no sharks in this tank.

19:45.230 --> 19:46.000
They're over there.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.170
They're stunt men.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.210
Okay, but this one still ate my shoe!

19:56.140 --> 19:59.210
Why would you do all this?

19:59.240 --> 20:00.980
It's all part of my movie research.

20:01.010 --> 20:05.250
How does this help? You're starring
in a movie as a musical prodigy.

20:05.280 --> 20:09.250
No. I'm starring in a movie
about a musical prodigy.

20:09.290 --> 20:12.220
I play the psycho girl
who tries to steal her life.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.200
Wow.

20:15.230 --> 20:18.170
You're going to be
really good in this role.

20:24.110 --> 20:27.940
Thank you.

all the foul language?

22:00.270 --> 22:03.300
"Darn this"
and "darn that."

22:03.340 --> 22:06.170
This world is going to
heck in a hand basket.

22:06.210 --> 22:08.040
You can knock it off.
We're in the clear.

22:10.810 --> 22:14.120
Look at the babies the baby movie.

22:15.990 --> 22:17.350
Leave us alone, orphans!

22:18.990 --> 22:21.060
You got any yummy bears left over?

22:21.090 --> 22:23.190
I don't, I swear!

22:23.230 --> 22:25.060
I think they're holding out on us.

22:25.100 --> 22:26.230
Let's get 'em!

22:26.260 --> 22:28.200
Orphan style!
