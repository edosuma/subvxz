00:06.667 --> 00:08.208
RHODES: World's a crazy place right now.

00:09.500 --> 00:12.958
Alliances are all torn apart.
The world's broken.

00:13.042 --> 00:16.292
Symbols are nothing without
the women and men that give them meaning.

00:16.375 --> 00:18.917
Thank you, Captain America.
But this belongs to you.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.042
DR. RAYNOR: Tell me about
your most recent nightmare.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.250

-(GUNSHOT)

00:28.500 --> 00:30.667
Look, I know that
you have been through a lot,

00:30.750 --> 00:32.833
but you've got your mind back,

00:32.917 --> 00:35.750
you are being pardoned. You're free.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.417
To do what?

00:37.500 --> 00:38.875
TORRES: Oh, bam! Right there!

00:38.958 --> 00:41.208
You see these guys?
They're guys you gotta worry about.

00:41.292 --> 00:42.708
They're called the Flag Smashers.

00:42.792 --> 00:46.000
They want a world
that's unified without borders.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.458
SAM: So, this is the leader
of the Flag Smashers, huh?

00:48.542 --> 00:50.125
-(GROANS)
-He's strong.

00:50.208 --> 00:52.583
SARAH: Oh, my God, Sam.
You better look at this.

(MAN ON TV) Join me
in welcoming your new Captain America.

01:46.708 --> 01:47.917
Reliving the glory days?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.792
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

01:53.750 --> 01:56.958
I remember sneaking into this locker room

01:57.042 --> 01:59.625
before each game to see you.

01:59.708 --> 02:01.333
It's probably why we always won.

02:02.833 --> 02:04.167
You nervous?

02:05.333 --> 02:06.750
-Who, me?
-Mmm-hmm.

02:06.833 --> 02:07.875
Never.

02:07.958 --> 02:09.208
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

02:10.333 --> 02:13.375
I've been a captain before,
obviously, but this is different.

02:13.458 --> 02:14.750
This is...

02:20.667 --> 02:23.917
Everybody in the world

02:24.000 --> 02:28.542
expects me to be something.

02:32.875 --> 02:34.667
And I don't wanna fail them.

02:37.208 --> 02:39.542
-I know.
-Yeah.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
Be yourself.

02:43.083 --> 02:44.083
Yeah.

02:45.250 --> 02:46.542
They're gonna love you.

02:47.875 --> 02:48.875
(CHUCKLES)

02:50.875 --> 02:52.292
Good luck.

02:55.125 --> 02:57.292
-Love you.
-Love you.

(MUFFLED CROWD CHEERING)

03:00.417 --> 03:03.333

-Not yet. You're up.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.500
-Copy that.
-WALKER: Good morning.

03:05.583 --> 03:07.292
Good morning, America.
Good morning.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.208
(SOFTLY) No, you're Captain America,
you're not...

03:09.292 --> 03:13.208
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Good morning. John, Captain, uh...

03:13.292 --> 03:14.458
Captain America.

03:14.542 --> 03:16.833
And that's why you failed drama class.

03:16.917 --> 03:18.292
(LAUGHS)

03:20.667 --> 03:22.583
-Can you believe this?
-(CHUCKLES) I know, right?

03:22.667 --> 03:24.917
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
-Two weeks ago we're prepping the team

03:25.000 --> 03:26.917
for a special ops mission
in Chile, now this.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.708
Don't get me wrong, this has been great,

03:29.792 --> 03:31.958
it's been great,
but it's been a lot of handshakes,

03:32.042 --> 03:34.708
a lot of suits, a lot of speeches,

03:34.792 --> 03:36.625
and senator meetings,

03:38.000 --> 03:39.750
and I just wanna do the job.

03:41.333 --> 03:43.625
-This is the job, John.
-Yeah.

03:43.708 --> 03:45.125
All of it is.

03:45.208 --> 03:48.542
Star-spangled man
with a plan and all that.

03:48.625 --> 03:50.625
It's always been in the job description.

03:52.917 --> 03:56.167
Listen, this suit,
it comes with expectations, brother.

03:56.250 --> 03:57.250
WALKER: Mmm-hmm.

03:58.208 --> 04:02.000
You can't just punch your way
out of problems anymore, you know?

04:02.083 --> 04:03.333
Mmm-hmm.

04:05.125 --> 04:06.250
Time to go to work.

04:15.792 --> 04:17.083
Time to go to work.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.667
Yeah! (CHUCKLES)

06:03.208 --> 06:06.333
Thank you so much for coming.
This has gotta be fun, though,

06:06.417 --> 06:08.833
coming back to your high school
after so much has changed?

06:08.917 --> 06:11.292

-(CHUCKLES) Oh, it's great. We're...

06:11.375 --> 06:12.958
-(CROWD CHEERING)
-Oh!

06:13.042 --> 06:14.417
Yeah.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.917
John, I think the first thing
everyone wants to know

06:17.000 --> 06:19.667
is what is it like being Captain America?

06:19.750 --> 06:22.542
Do eagles fly overhead wherever you go?

06:22.625 --> 06:24.958
(LAUGHS) Uh, yes.

06:25.042 --> 06:26.042
(CHUCKLES)

06:26.125 --> 06:29.542
Yeah, that and flags tend
to start majestically waving in the wind.

06:29.625 --> 06:30.750
And how's the tour been?

06:30.833 --> 06:32.667
I know they did
a big rollout for you, right?

06:32.750 --> 06:35.125
It's the greatest honor of my life.

06:35.208 --> 06:37.542
Um, but I'm just
a little shocked, I think.

06:37.625 --> 06:39.458
How did a guy like me end up here?
(CHUCKLES)

06:39.542 --> 06:41.208
Oh, wait, wait, wait. "A guy like me"?

06:41.292 --> 06:43.458
Somebody's being a bit too humble.

06:43.542 --> 06:45.833
For those of you
who aren't familiar with his résumé,

06:46.792 --> 06:50.750
"John Walker, first person in American
history to receive three Medals of Honor,

06:50.833 --> 06:54.917
"ran RS-One missions
in counterterrorism and hostage rescue."

06:55.000 --> 06:58.167
The government
did a study of your body at MIT,

06:58.250 --> 07:02.208
and you tested off the charts
in every measurable category.

07:02.292 --> 07:04.417
Speed, endurance, intelligence...

07:04.500 --> 07:08.417
Look, here's the thing, uh,
I'm not Tony Stark,

07:08.500 --> 07:10.167
I'm not Dr. Banner, okay?

07:10.250 --> 07:13.292
I don't have the flashiest gadgets,
I don't have super strength.

07:13.375 --> 07:15.542
But what I do have

07:15.625 --> 07:16.625
is guts.

07:16.708 --> 07:19.083
Something Captain America always had,

07:19.167 --> 07:21.833
always needs to have,
and I'm gonna need every ounce of it.

07:21.917 --> 07:24.333
Because I got big shoes to fill.

07:24.417 --> 07:25.958
ANNOUNCER: Did you know Steve Rogers?

07:26.042 --> 07:29.042
WALKER: I was two years out of West Point
when Steve came back on the scene.

07:29.125 --> 07:32.000
I followed his career
very closely as an Avenger.

07:32.083 --> 07:34.250
I like to think
that I modeled my work after his.

07:34.333 --> 07:36.333
ANNOUNCER: You've always
wanted to be a hero?

07:36.417 --> 07:40.708
I liked that what I was doing
would make people feel safe.

07:41.292 --> 07:43.875
Steve Rogers was the kind of guy
who could do that,

07:43.958 --> 07:45.292
he gave me hope.

07:45.375 --> 07:46.917
Even though I never met him,

07:48.000 --> 07:49.208
he feels like a brother.

07:49.292 --> 07:50.375
ANNOUNCER: Wow.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.292
TORRES: Seems like a good guy.

08:04.375 --> 08:06.708
-You met him?
-No.

08:07.667 --> 08:09.417
Thanks for doing this
on such short notice.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.042
Yeah. No sweat.
I'm just finishing up the checklist.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.250
You'll be all good to go
once you land in Munich.

08:18.750 --> 08:22.625
-Shouldn't have given up the shield.
-Good to see you too, Buck.

08:24.625 --> 08:27.583
-This is wrong.
-Hey, hey, look, I'm working, all right?

08:27.667 --> 08:29.708
So all this outrage is gonna have to wait.

08:29.792 --> 08:31.458
You didn't know that was gonna happen?

08:31.542 --> 08:33.625
No, of course I didn't know
that was gonna happen.

08:33.707 --> 08:36.457
You think it didn't break my heart
to see them march him out there

08:36.542 --> 08:39.250
-and call him the new Captain America?
-Steve didn't want this.

08:39.332 --> 08:41.000
Oh, my God. What do you want me to do?

08:41.082 --> 08:43.957
Call America
and tell 'em I changed my mind? Huh?

08:44.042 --> 08:48.000
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, right.
It's a great reunion, buddy, be well.

08:48.083 --> 08:50.000
You had no right
to give up the shield, Sam.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.750
Hey. This is what you're not gonna do.

08:51.833 --> 08:54.208
You're not gonna
come here in your overextended life

08:54.292 --> 08:56.208
and tell me about my rights.

08:57.167 --> 08:58.458
It's over, Bucky.

08:59.167 --> 09:01.500
Besides, I have bigger things
to deal with now.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.083
What could be bigger than this?

09:06.875 --> 09:07.875
This guy.

09:07.958 --> 09:11.500
His connections with rebel organizations
all over Eastern and Central Europe,

09:11.583 --> 09:14.208
and he's strong. Too strong.

09:15.208 --> 09:16.250
And?

09:16.333 --> 09:20.208
Well, he's been connected to this
online group called the Flag Smashers.

09:20.292 --> 09:24.500
Now, Redwing traced them
to a building somewhere outside of Munich.

09:24.583 --> 09:27.333
-So that's where I'm going.
-Well, I don't trust Redwing.

09:27.417 --> 09:30.292
-Hold on a minute.
-You don't have to trust Redwing,

09:31.000 --> 09:32.583
but I'mma go see if he's right.

09:32.667 --> 09:35.917
'Cause I have a feeling
they might be a part of the Big Three.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.792
-What "Big Three"?
-The Big Three.

09:37.875 --> 09:40.792
-What Big Three?
-Androids, aliens, and wizards.

09:40.875 --> 09:43.125
-That's not a thing.
-That's definitely a thing.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.458
No, it's not.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.333
Every time we fight,
it's one of the three.

09:46.417 --> 09:49.333
-Who are you fighting now, Gandalf?
-How do you know about Gandalf?

09:49.417 --> 09:53.125
I read The Hobbit
in 1937 when it first came out.

09:53.208 --> 09:56.708
-So you see my point?
-No, I don't. There are no wizards.

09:56.792 --> 09:58.292
-Doctor Strange.
-Is a sorcerer.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.167
Aah! (CHUCKLES)

10:00.250 --> 10:02.792
A sorcerer is a wizard without a hat.

10:03.750 --> 10:05.250
Think about it. Right?

10:05.333 --> 10:07.708
I'm right.
I just came up with that. It's crazy.

10:07.792 --> 10:10.500
But that's not the point.
These guys aren't magical.

10:10.583 --> 10:11.917
They use brute force like you,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.833
the incredibly annoying guy
in front of me with the staring problem.

10:14.917 --> 10:17.042
BUCKY: I'm coming with you.
SAM: No, you're not.

10:23.208 --> 10:24.250
(ALARM BLARES)

10:24.333 --> 10:26.792
One minute to drop off, Sam.

10:48.375 --> 10:49.458
So what's our plan?

10:52.875 --> 10:55.208
Great. So no plan.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.000
Thirty seconds!

10:58.833 --> 11:01.250
-Enjoy your ride, Buck.
-No, you can't call me that.

11:01.333 --> 11:02.958
Why not? That's what Steve called you.

11:03.042 --> 11:05.000
Steve knew me longer,
and Steve had a plan.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.792
TORRES: Fifteen seconds to drop.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.250
FALCON: I have a plan.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.333
Really?

11:11.792 --> 11:12.792
What is it?

11:16.667 --> 11:17.792
Great.

11:18.875 --> 11:20.167
Where's the chute?

11:20.250 --> 11:22.625
We're at 200 feet.
It's too low for a chute.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.625
WINTER SOLDIER: I don't need it anyway.

11:28.583 --> 11:29.792
You sure about that?

11:33.458 --> 11:34.458
Yeah.

You know that, right?

12:02.417 --> 12:05.208
Get out of my face, Sam, or I'll break it.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.958
Okay, head north. Come on.

12:27.708 --> 12:29.458
FALCON: Oh-ho-ho. Don't hurt him.

12:40.250 --> 12:41.792
You're doing the staring thing again.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.500
They're in there.

12:53.750 --> 12:55.458
-Where's the guy?
-FALCON: I don't know.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.417
I think they're smuggling weapons, though.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.458
-Well, I think you could be right.
-Hmm.

12:59.542 --> 13:01.625
But there's only one way to find out.

13:02.292 --> 13:04.167
I see a clear path. I say we take it.

13:05.167 --> 13:06.167
We're not assassins.

13:07.625 --> 13:10.083
I'll see you inside or not.

13:11.333 --> 13:13.708
Hey, come on, man.
I'm just messing with you. Come back.

13:19.583 --> 13:22.292
Look at you. All stealthy. (CHUCKLES)

13:22.375 --> 13:25.167
A little time in Wakanda
and you come out White Panther.

13:25.250 --> 13:28.042
-It's actually White Wolf.
-Huh?

13:32.792 --> 13:35.750
All right, I'm inside.
Therefore, way ahead of you.

13:35.833 --> 13:37.875
It's not great, but very doable.

13:39.667 --> 13:40.708
Huh?

13:41.958 --> 13:45.250
-Hello. How are you?
-Good. What did I miss? Nothing.

13:45.333 --> 13:46.792
-All right, let's go.
-No, wait.

13:46.875 --> 13:49.500
I got a vibranium arm. I can take them.

13:49.583 --> 13:51.917
And I can fly. Who gives a shit? Wait.

13:52.667 --> 13:55.458
-I want to see where they're going.
-There's two people.

13:56.125 --> 13:57.875
-You only see two?
-That's what I saw.

13:57.958 --> 13:59.917
-Let me see what Redwing sees.
-All right.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.708
FALCON: Let's see what Redwing...

14:03.375 --> 14:06.042
Oh, look at that.
How many people you see now?

14:06.125 --> 14:09.625
-One, two... Oh, here it comes again.
-(SIGHS)

-Yeah, five. Yeah.

So they're strong. Whatever.

14:15.458 --> 14:16.833

-No, no, wait.

And we're pretty sure
it's one of the Big Three, so...

CAPTAIN AMERICA: Pretty sure.

19:45.708 --> 19:47.333
There's no such thing as wizards.

19:47.417 --> 19:50.458
-Then it's aliens, or androids...
-Or Super Soldiers.

it doesn't mean you're Captain America.

20:22.708 --> 20:25.875
Okay, so we've got eight Super Soldiers
on a bulk supply run.

20:26.708 --> 20:27.708
Why?

20:28.667 --> 20:32.792
They say their mission is to get things
back to the way it was during The Blip.

20:32.875 --> 20:36.208
-Maybe they're just trying to help.
-They had a funny way of showing it.

have a great track record. No offense.

20:44.875 --> 20:48.292
Uh, no, we didn't track them,
we tracked you, uh, through Redwing.

You hacked my tech?

21:23.875 --> 21:26.625
Well, they provide the resources
and we keep things stable.

Yeah, violent revolutionaries
aren't usually good for anyone's cause.

with the resources.

-No.

was gonna end up here.

22:04.375 --> 22:05.542
I get it, Bucky.

22:06.333 --> 22:10.333
And I'm... I'm not trying to be Steve.

22:10.417 --> 22:12.042
I'm not trying to replace Steve.

22:13.333 --> 22:17.167
I'm just trying to be
the best Captain America I can be.

22:18.167 --> 22:19.167
That's it.

people supporting the cause like this?

We can't let these assholes

who were put back
in power after The Blip win.

24:44.958 --> 24:46.667

who came back
than the ones who never left.

Let's take the shield
and do this ourselves.

25:29.500 --> 25:32.083

beat him up, and take it.

what happened the last time we stole it?

-Maybe.
-I'll help you in case you forgot.

26:41.417 --> 26:45.083
No, no.
My daddy told me it's Black Falcon.

26:45.875 --> 26:48.500
Is it because
I'm Black and I'm the Falcon?

26:48.583 --> 26:51.333
Well, technically, I mean, yes.

26:51.417 --> 26:53.708

27:22.458 --> 27:24.125

27:26.708 --> 27:28.500
Look, we just want to talk to him.

27:28.583 --> 27:30.500
You must not hear what I just said.

27:32.042 --> 27:33.667
You ain't getting in this house.

27:34.375 --> 27:35.583
Y'all can leave now.

27:38.458 --> 27:41.125
Tell him the guy
from the bar in Goyang is here.

27:42.083 --> 27:43.708
He's gonna know what that means.

27:47.917 --> 27:49.167
All right, wait here.

27:53.792 --> 27:56.375
Nice kid. How do you know this guy?

27:57.500 --> 27:58.542
I used to.

27:58.625 --> 28:00.417
We had a skirmish
during the Korean War.

28:06.167 --> 28:07.625
BOY: Today's your lucky day.

28:08.583 --> 28:10.458
He said he wanna see for himself.

28:15.542 --> 28:17.083
(OBJECT CLATTERS)

28:17.167 --> 28:18.417
Isaiah?

28:19.208 --> 28:20.417
Look at you.

28:22.875 --> 28:27.792
This is, uh, Sam. Sam, this is Isaiah.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.208
He was a hero.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.833
One of the ones that HYDRA
feared the most. Like Steve.

28:34.417 --> 28:36.000
We met in '51.

28:36.083 --> 28:41.917
If by met, you mean
I whupped your ass, then, yeah.

28:42.958 --> 28:45.250
We heard whispers he was on the peninsula,

28:46.500 --> 28:49.625
but everyone they sent after him,
never came back.

28:51.417 --> 28:55.208
So the U.S. military dropped me
behind the line to go deal with him.

28:56.417 --> 28:59.875
I took half that metal arm
in that fight in Goyang,

28:59.958 --> 29:02.708
but I see he's managed to grow it back.

29:05.375 --> 29:07.958
I just wanted to see
if he got the arm back.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.500
Or if he'd come to kill me.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.667
I'm not a killer anymore.

29:18.375 --> 29:22.292
You think you can wake up one day
and decide who you wanna be?

29:23.708 --> 29:25.708
It doesn't work like that.

29:25.792 --> 29:28.708
Well, maybe it does for folks like you.

29:30.792 --> 29:32.417
Isaiah, the reason we're here

29:34.625 --> 29:37.000
is because there's more
of you and me out there.

29:37.583 --> 29:39.875
-You and me.
-And we need to know how.

29:39.958 --> 29:42.000
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.

-I asked you a question, Bucky.
-I know.

-Steve didn't know about him?
-He didn't. I didn't tell him.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.250
So you're telling me
that there was a black Super Soldier

Yeah, we did some field ops
back in the day.

so I thought I'd step in.

they wanna build together.

-Absolutely not.
-Of course not.

34:28.042 --> 34:29.458
DR. RAYNOR: Okay, it goes like this.

34:30.500 --> 34:33.500
Suppose that while you're sleeping,
a miracle occurs.

34:34.500 --> 34:35.542
When you wake up,

34:35.625 --> 34:38.917
what is something that you would like
to see that would make your life better?

he would talk less.

at each other in the eyes.

that has nothing to do with you?

36:14.250 --> 36:15.708
He trusted you.

36:15.792 --> 36:17.667
He gave you that shield for a reason.

36:17.750 --> 36:20.917

that is everything he stood for.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.000
That is his legacy.

36:22.083 --> 36:24.875
He gave you that shield,
and you threw it away like it was nothing.

36:24.958 --> 36:26.708
-SAM: Shut up.
-So maybe he was wrong about you.

36:26.792 --> 36:29.417
And if he was wrong about you,
then he was wrong about me.

36:35.792 --> 36:36.833
You finished?

36:38.208 --> 36:40.417
-Yeah.
-SAM: All right, good.

36:41.333 --> 36:45.167
Maybe this is something you
or Steve will never understand.

36:47.167 --> 36:50.083
But can you accept
that I did what I thought was right?

36:56.000 --> 36:58.958

We go deal with that, and when we're done,

37:11.083 --> 37:13.667
we both can go on separate, long vacations

37:13.750 --> 37:16.917

We've been targeting civilians

38:21.250 --> 38:23.417
who've been helping
Karli move from place to place.

38:23.500 --> 38:26.167
They geotagged a location,
then scrambled the signal.

have found their symbol popping up
