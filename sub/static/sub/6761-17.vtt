01:54.238 --> 01:55.865
Hey, yo, Ace! Wait up.

01:55.948 --> 01:58.284
You've got a determined look
on your face.

01:58.367 --> 02:01.203
No, what I've got is a proposition.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.831
Your desk or mine, huh?

02:05.624 --> 02:09.627
Look, it came to me
in the middle of the night like a vision.

02:09.711 --> 02:11.714
"Run for office"?

02:11.797 --> 02:13.090
No one even knows me here.

02:13.174 --> 02:17.178
Yeah, but that's perfect. No one
knows you well enough to hate you.

02:17.261 --> 02:19.305
Have a nice day, Andrea.

02:20.014 --> 02:21.640
Brandon, please.

02:21.974 --> 02:23.893
The candidate I was backing
chickened out.

02:23.976 --> 02:26.353
There is no reason we have to let
the popular airheads

02:26.437 --> 02:27.855
run the student government.

02:27.938 --> 02:30.649
Now, are you a candidate or a coward?

02:31.483 --> 02:33.527
Well, at least you weren't snoring
in class.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.446
I don't know what's wrong with me.

02:35.529 --> 02:37.156
Maybe you have mono.

02:37.239 --> 02:40.326
Thank you, Dr Donna,
but it's only happening in school.

02:40.409 --> 02:42.202
I don't know.
Well, I'll see you guys later, okay?

02:42.286 --> 02:43.412
Bye.

02:44.121 --> 02:46.290
Hey, a moment of your time?

02:47.207 --> 02:48.709
I'm counting.

02:48.876 --> 02:51.003
I can't take you to the Fallout Club
this weekend.

02:51.086 --> 02:54.840
I have to fly down to Mexico City
and see the old man for a few days.

02:54.923 --> 02:57.342
The old meeting Dad excuse.

02:57.426 --> 02:58.677
Brenda...

02:58.760 --> 03:01.847
Look, I understand. Take me with you.

03:02.389 --> 03:04.516
Yeah, right. Me, you, Dad.

03:05.058 --> 03:06.894
I'm just so bored here.

03:06.977 --> 03:08.061
Poor baby.

03:08.145 --> 03:10.772
Well, look, you can go to the club
and use my name.

03:10.856 --> 03:12.399
They'll let you in.

03:12.482 --> 03:15.485
Yo, politicos.
A last minute dark horse entry

03:15.569 --> 03:17.654
into the junior class
presidential elections.

03:17.779 --> 03:21.325
Brandon Walsh,
the new kid on the West Beverly block.

03:21.783 --> 03:23.910
The sister is always the last to know.

03:23.994 --> 03:27.330
He kind of looks like a politician.
He's got that Kennedy hair...

03:27.456 --> 03:28.790
Yo, Pres!

03:32.085 --> 03:35.547
- It's like a magnet.
- What?

03:36.298 --> 03:37.466
Power.

03:44.472 --> 03:46.766
I can't believe you guys
didn't just honk...

03:46.850 --> 03:49.060
We wanted to congratulate Brandon.

03:49.144 --> 03:50.312
Hi.

03:51.187 --> 03:54.316
What great news!
You know, we've always felt bad about

03:54.399 --> 03:57.068
moving here and screwing up your plans
to run back home.

03:57.152 --> 03:59.612
- Do you think you can pull it off?
- Oh, definitely.

03:59.696 --> 04:02.365
- The other guy's a nobody, too.
- Hey, girls.

04:02.449 --> 04:03.783
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

04:03.867 --> 04:05.368
No offence.

04:05.744 --> 04:08.329
I've never been friends
with a candidate before.

04:08.413 --> 04:10.123
Friends with a candidate's sister.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.500
Right. I've never even voted.

04:13.084 --> 04:15.086
Well, you got to get involved, Kel.

04:15.170 --> 04:17.630
It's important to try to change things.

04:17.714 --> 04:20.007
I've never thought about that.

04:22.260 --> 04:24.596
I'm gonna go change my jacket.

04:24.971 --> 04:27.056
Congratulations, Brandon.

04:31.477 --> 04:32.687
Brenda.

04:34.564 --> 04:37.984
Brenda, honey, do you know
where the art supplies are?

04:38.067 --> 04:39.318
Sorry.

04:39.736 --> 04:41.029
Mom?

04:42.321 --> 04:45.700
Do you ever feel like a phone call
that's been disconnected?

04:45.783 --> 04:49.078
Honey, it goes with the territory
of being a teenager.

04:49.203 --> 04:52.290
Along with hormone hell, bad driving,

04:52.373 --> 04:54.500
classes that don't relate to life.

04:55.293 --> 04:56.669
Well, don't worry, honey.

04:56.752 --> 05:01.757
I know it sounds hokey, but it's all
part of growing into who you are.

05:03.259 --> 05:05.344
- I just feel like...
- Cindy,

05:05.428 --> 05:07.513
let's get these campaign buttons rolling!

05:07.597 --> 05:08.931
Yes, sir!

05:10.641 --> 05:12.852
Honey, you'll do just fine.

05:12.935 --> 05:15.771
Come on, Brenda,
we're gonna be late for the club.

05:15.855 --> 05:18.024
I feel like I don't belong.

05:19.817 --> 05:22.737
<i>Hi. For you newcomers,
my name is Sky.</i>

05:22.820 --> 05:27.032
<i>Welcome to the coffee house
that doesn't take itself too seriously.</i>

05:27.116 --> 05:28.576
<i>We've got a little bit of everything here,</i>

05:28.659 --> 05:31.370
<i>comedy, poetry, personal confessions.</i>

05:31.495 --> 05:33.122
Talk about not belonging.

05:33.205 --> 05:35.708
<i>We have just walked into Beetle Juice.</i>

05:35.791 --> 05:39.086
Oh, come on, you guys,
this is the hot new place.

05:39.545 --> 05:41.589
But it's so smoky in here.

05:41.672 --> 05:43.591
<i>Basically our motto is,
"If you'll sit through it,</i>

05:43.674 --> 05:47.803
<i>"we'll do just about anything up here."
Anyway, like I said, my name is Sky,</i>

05:47.928 --> 05:50.556
<i>it really is. My parents named me that.
No kidding.</i>

05:50.681 --> 05:53.976
<i>And it gets worse.
My middle name is Blue Yonder.</i>

05:54.476 --> 05:58.731
<i>You see, my dad was in the Air Force,
my mother was a pothead.</i>

05:59.231 --> 06:01.984
<i>I guess that makes me an airhead, huh?</i>

06:03.026 --> 06:06.613
<i>You know something though,
being a GI brat was great training</i>

06:06.697 --> 06:09.867
<i>for being up here,
because in both instances I had to learn</i>

06:09.950 --> 06:12.494
<i>how to make people like me. Fast.</i>

06:14.288 --> 06:16.039
<i>The most grueling part
of my basic training</i>

06:16.123 --> 06:18.542
<i>was switching high schools
in the middle of the year.</i>

06:18.625 --> 06:21.461
<i>I would pray to God that
I wouldn't wind up a POW.</i>

06:21.586 --> 06:23.672
<i>Permanently Outcast Wuss.</i>

06:26.258 --> 06:29.678
<i>Well, I figured it out. In order to survive
the high school trenches,</i>

06:29.761 --> 06:32.556
<i>I had to devise a battle plan and I did.</i>

06:32.639 --> 06:35.267
<i>My strategy was
swift and comprehensive.</i>

06:35.350 --> 06:37.978
<i>First point of attack:
Don't join any cliques.</i>

06:38.061 --> 06:39.813
<i>Join every clique.</i>

06:40.730 --> 06:41.773
That is so true.

06:42.774 --> 06:44.609
It's not that funny.

06:46.444 --> 06:49.823
Anyway, this girl Sara
has the most amazing body.

06:50.448 --> 06:53.243
She's got this citrus thing going.

06:53.868 --> 06:55.954
All she wears is orange.

06:57.038 --> 06:58.290
It's bizarre.

06:59.082 --> 07:01.459
All right, how does this sound, man?

07:01.543 --> 07:03.920
"I'll listen to my student body."

07:05.547 --> 07:08.091
Dude, that's not gonna flush here.

07:08.216 --> 07:11.928
You know what the vice president of
Beverly Hills High School did last year?

07:12.721 --> 07:16.057
He took out a different girl every week.
Know why?

07:16.850 --> 07:19.144
So he could nail their votes.

07:20.186 --> 07:22.522
- That's sick.
- No, that's slick.

07:22.939 --> 07:26.025
Politics are very ugly
in kind of a cool way.

07:26.401 --> 07:27.443
What do you mean?

07:27.569 --> 07:29.320
Well, my mom says that
politics and show business

07:29.404 --> 07:30.822
are in the same game.

07:30.905 --> 07:32.657
You have to know the A-list people.

07:32.782 --> 07:35.785
- Listen, Steve, all I want to do is...
- Win?

07:36.703 --> 07:40.039
Politicians that win
go for the jugular, Brandon.

07:40.790 --> 07:42.959
I just don't know
if I've got the killer instinct.

07:43.126 --> 07:44.585
Yeah, you do.

07:45.503 --> 07:46.963
Walsh. Walsh.

07:47.088 --> 07:51.384
<i>So that's my life story,
soon to be a minor motion picture.</i>

07:53.803 --> 07:58.432
<i>Thank you very much, boys and girls.
And please, be kind to your waitress.</i>

08:03.437 --> 08:05.189
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

08:06.023 --> 08:08.109
You were really wonderful.

08:08.818 --> 08:09.860
Thanks.

08:10.778 --> 08:13.155
You look so familiar to me.
Have you been here before?

08:13.239 --> 08:16.742
No, I'm new in town.
An accounting brat from Minnesota.

08:16.826 --> 08:20.997
Oh, we're practically related.
Would you girls like some coffee?

08:21.080 --> 08:22.498
Cappuccino.

08:23.082 --> 08:26.210
Cafe au lait with chocolate,
hold the cinnamon.

08:26.669 --> 08:29.463
- Can I just get a Coke?
- Yeah, you bet.

08:29.880 --> 08:33.801
Here comes Jack.
You girls are gonna love him.

08:33.884 --> 08:37.054
<i>Hello! It's good to be back here
at the Fallout Club.</i>

08:37.136 --> 08:40.265
<i>Nice to see all you
mutant radiation victims.</i>

08:40.349 --> 08:42.268
Whipped cream on mine.

08:42.393 --> 08:44.436
<i>"Whipped cream on yours"?</i>

08:44.687 --> 08:46.605
<i>So, what do we have here,</i>

08:47.106 --> 08:52.027
<i>a typical California girl, blonde,
into the important things,</i>

08:52.194 --> 08:55.114
<i>like clothes, make-up.</i>

08:55.364 --> 08:58.200
<i>Way too much make-up.</i>

08:58.575 --> 08:59.785
Let's get out of here, girls.

08:59.868 --> 09:01.912
You know, I love it when people make
snap judgments

09:01.995 --> 09:03.038
without any information.

09:03.163 --> 09:06.125
You can be so much more objective
that way.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.294
<i>A hecklette. Let me guess.</i>

09:09.378 --> 09:12.589
<i>You tried on 50 jackets
and none of them worked,</i>

09:13.090 --> 09:15.634
<i>so you decided to go with this one.</i>

09:15.968 --> 09:19.680
Yeah, kind of like you. You tried out
50 jokes and none of them worked.

09:19.763 --> 09:22.099
<i>Ouch, I'm cut, I'm bleeding.</i>

09:23.058 --> 09:26.270
- I didn't know she could do that.
- Neither did she.

09:27.229 --> 09:29.940
So there I was,
listening to Kelly being heckled,

09:30.023 --> 09:31.692
and instantly I knew what to do.

09:31.775 --> 09:35.153
That's great, honey.
Would you pass the glue, please?

09:35.278 --> 09:37.280
Oh, that might be the door.

09:37.364 --> 09:40.659
Mom, these performance-oriented
coffee houses are really happening.

09:40.742 --> 09:42.327
I mean, I really felt part of it.

09:42.411 --> 09:44.704
Right. Is this button crooked?

09:44.788 --> 09:46.331
No, it's fine.

09:46.456 --> 09:48.333
And Dad, I'm pregnant.

09:49.918 --> 09:51.378
Just testing.

09:54.506 --> 09:57.425
Use neon. Or a big "W" for winner.

09:58.343 --> 10:00.512
That's a good idea. Thanks.

10:01.179 --> 10:04.307
I was up all night from that
toxic cappuccino,

10:05.100 --> 10:08.478
thinking about what you said
about getting involved.

10:09.729 --> 10:12.774
Brandon, I can help you win.
I know everyone.

10:13.024 --> 10:15.235
Or how to glom on to everyone. Right?

10:15.318 --> 10:17.320
And that is exactly what you need.

10:17.404 --> 10:21.449
Kelly, whenever political stuff comes on,
you switch to MTV.

10:25.203 --> 10:26.955
Any help would be appreciated.

10:27.038 --> 10:29.999
- Any help doing what?
- Excuse me, hi.

10:30.333 --> 10:33.378
- I am going to run Brandon's campaign.
- What?

10:35.213 --> 10:37.548
I thought I was gonna do that.

10:37.632 --> 10:40.760
Well, isn't there enough room
for both of you?

10:43.429 --> 10:44.847
Excuse us.

10:48.851 --> 10:52.980
Brandon, remember when I told you
about that friend who was gonna run

10:53.064 --> 10:54.482
and then backed out?

10:54.565 --> 10:55.733
Yeah.

10:56.609 --> 10:58.402
That coward was me.

10:58.945 --> 11:00.530
Why'd you quit?

11:00.613 --> 11:02.281
Because I didn't want to lose.

11:02.365 --> 11:04.200
Well, neither do I.

11:04.492 --> 11:06.661
Democracy needs you, Andrea.

11:06.744 --> 11:09.372
I need you. Okay?

11:11.374 --> 11:12.542
Okay.

11:15.461 --> 11:17.171
Okay, I'm ready.

11:17.922 --> 11:21.342
Oh, Brenda, I can't go with you.
We need to have a campaign meeting.

11:21.425 --> 11:23.302
Yeah, why don't you stay
and work with us?

11:23.386 --> 11:24.679
I can't.

11:24.845 --> 11:28.474
Sky invited us to a political blab-fest
this afternoon.

11:28.891 --> 11:30.726
Donna and I will go.

11:31.185 --> 11:35.940
Well, actually, the smoke in that club,
it just murders my contacts, really.

11:36.065 --> 11:39.693
Fine. I'll go alone.
I guess Sky is too mature for you guys.

11:39.777 --> 11:42.863
Please.
They don't even card at that club.

11:43.030 --> 11:44.073
Do they?

11:53.499 --> 11:55.918
Hey, Brenda, I'm glad you made it.

11:56.043 --> 11:59.672
Listen, Jack and I are doing this
Earth relief benefit.

11:59.755 --> 12:00.923
Here's a flyer.

12:01.006 --> 12:04.927
Oh, cool. Tomorrow. A.M.

12:05.719 --> 12:07.679
Why, you a morning phobe, too?

12:07.763 --> 12:10.474
No, I've got school tomorrow.
I wish I didn't.

12:10.557 --> 12:13.227
Truth is, I feel out of touch
with all that stuff.

12:13.310 --> 12:18.065
Oh, God, I hear that. That's why I left
bad old Modesto High at 16.

12:18.148 --> 12:19.399
What about your parents?

12:19.483 --> 12:22.486
They bagged on me a little bit at first.
But they came around.

12:22.569 --> 12:23.695
Wow.

12:23.904 --> 12:25.739
Yeah, it was sweet!

12:25.822 --> 12:29.243
My cousin was driving across
the country and I just had to go with her.

12:29.326 --> 12:32.913
So then we took off for Greece
and, many adventures later,

12:32.996 --> 12:34.665
I wound up here.

12:34.748 --> 12:36.583
You've really lived.

12:37.125 --> 12:40.087
I've been stuck
in popularity contest land.

12:40.253 --> 12:42.798
I guess that's why I oversleep
on the weekdays.

12:42.881 --> 12:46.009
I couldn't get out of bed before noon
when I was in high school.

12:46.093 --> 12:48.470
It's the legacy of being a new kid.

12:48.553 --> 12:52.891
But you know something, when I got out,
I had this awakening.

12:53.225 --> 12:57.562
I started reading these great books
and getting into environmental causes.

12:57.646 --> 13:00.065
I could be doing this, just like you.

13:00.190 --> 13:03.235
Yeah, you remind me a lot of me
when I was in high school,

13:03.318 --> 13:05.153
but you know something,
those high school diplomas,

13:05.237 --> 13:06.321
they really help.

13:06.404 --> 13:09.157
No, I'm not talking about dropping out.

13:09.240 --> 13:11.785
I'm talking about getting the best
of both worlds.

13:12.911 --> 13:16.915
Here's the high school equivalency form
you requested.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.166
Thank you.

13:18.249 --> 13:21.753
You know, your parents
are gonna have to sign this.

13:22.504 --> 13:26.091
Have you thought about
what you're going to tell them?

13:27.133 --> 13:29.010
I'll just tell them...

13:31.304 --> 13:33.890
I'll tell them I'm quitting school.

13:41.814 --> 13:43.024
What?

13:43.107 --> 13:45.610
No, you cannot drop out of school,

13:45.693 --> 13:48.154
even if you pass
a high school equivalency test.

13:48.488 --> 13:51.908
It's not dropping out.
It's getting your diploma early.

13:51.991 --> 13:53.117
It certainly is.

13:53.201 --> 13:55.995
Mom, you're always talking
about letting your little birdies

13:56.079 --> 13:57.622
fly off by themselves.

13:57.705 --> 13:59.332
So go skydiving again, honey,

13:59.415 --> 14:01.751
but the school experience
is too important.

14:01.834 --> 14:04.754
I learn so much more from my friends,

14:05.171 --> 14:09.675
I mean, the people at the Fallout Club,
they talk about books and politics.

14:09.884 --> 14:12.303
I want to learn from life,
not just memorize things.

14:12.386 --> 14:15.848
Honey, we all have fantasies like that
at your age.

14:15.932 --> 14:16.974
That's true.

14:17.058 --> 14:19.268
I wanted to be Judy Collins,
and go to Greenwich Village

14:19.352 --> 14:21.103
with a guitar on my back.

14:21.187 --> 14:23.356
And I wanted to join the Peace Corps
and save humanity.

14:23.439 --> 14:24.815
- See?
- There's a difference

14:24.899 --> 14:27.234
between dreaming about these things
and doing them.

14:27.318 --> 14:30.529
Exactly.
And in my case it's not just a fantasy.

14:30.738 --> 14:33.282
You've raised me so well,
I'm ahead of myself.

14:33.366 --> 14:35.326
Whoa, honey. Put on the brakes.

14:35.409 --> 14:37.453
We are not gonna let you
screw up your life.

14:37.536 --> 14:39.663
No, you don't wanna let me live my life.

14:39.747 --> 14:41.415
You just don't understand!

14:41.499 --> 14:43.626
- Yes, we do.
- No, you don't.

14:44.210 --> 14:48.047
All right, we don't understand
and the answer is still no!

14:49.423 --> 14:50.716
Oh, boy.

14:50.925 --> 14:52.510
She'll grow out of it.

14:52.593 --> 14:55.095
Thank God, Brandon's got his feet
on the ground.

14:59.850 --> 15:01.268
How's this?

15:01.894 --> 15:03.270
Oh, great.

15:03.646 --> 15:06.649
Tell me if I look like a dweeb, right?

15:07.650 --> 15:10.986
Here, I got some cute politician photos.

15:11.195 --> 15:13.781
Try to model yourself
after these guys, okay?

15:13.864 --> 15:15.783
Well, you've been busy.

15:16.784 --> 15:20.162
Kelly, Gary Hart never made it
to the nominations.

15:20.579 --> 15:22.706
And that's because he was too cute
for his own good.

15:22.831 --> 15:26.084
Look, what I think we need to focus on
are the issues.

15:26.168 --> 15:29.588
Yeah, see, I had this idea that
maybe we could feed

15:29.671 --> 15:31.465
some homeless people with
all the surplus food

15:31.548 --> 15:32.799
they throw out at the cafeteria.

15:32.883 --> 15:34.301
That's perfect.
Exactly what I'm talking about.

15:34.384 --> 15:38.680
Wait, we have got to hit people with
what they want for themselves...

15:38.847 --> 15:42.351
Hey, big news.
I've got my own campaign going

15:42.934 --> 15:44.311
to leave school.

15:44.394 --> 15:46.688
Brenda, that is a great idea.

15:46.855 --> 15:50.442
Yeah, we'll tell them
they can leave school for lunch.

15:52.486 --> 15:56.448
Brenda, you're not really serious about
quitting school, are you?

15:56.531 --> 15:57.657
Actually, I am serious.

15:57.741 --> 16:00.327
Well, you're seriously nuts
if you do that.

16:00.410 --> 16:03.914
Brandon, we've got to finish this roll.
The photo place closes soon.

16:13.423 --> 16:14.674
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

16:14.758 --> 16:17.302
Aren't you Brandon Walsh's sister?

16:17.927 --> 16:20.597
I feel like Ferris Bueller's sister.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.142
Okay, Brandon,
you have to go up to everybody,

16:24.225 --> 16:26.436
even those people that you don't like.
All right?

16:26.519 --> 16:28.938
Now, see those girls over there?

16:29.147 --> 16:31.024
I don't even know them.

16:31.107 --> 16:33.401
Smile. You have a cute smile.

16:34.402 --> 16:35.612
I do?

16:39.824 --> 16:40.950
Hi, how you doing?

16:41.034 --> 16:43.828
I'm Brandon Walsh. I'm running
for President and I'm glad to meet you.

16:44.537 --> 16:45.872
David...

16:47.248 --> 16:49.417
My God, she's waving at me.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.336
She must need something.

16:51.419 --> 16:54.380
She needs me.
She just doesn't know it yet.

16:56.341 --> 16:59.552
David, hi. Listen, I really need you.

16:59.886 --> 17:02.180
Brandon needs a hot campaign video.

17:02.263 --> 17:04.973
Something sexy. You can do it, right?

17:05.058 --> 17:06.142
Well, I'd love to,

17:06.224 --> 17:07.977
but since I'm broadcasting
Thursday's debate,

17:08.060 --> 17:10.980
I think it'd be
a conflict of interest or something.

17:11.063 --> 17:12.898
Gee, that's too bad.

17:13.023 --> 17:15.401
See, I was kind of hoping that

17:15.484 --> 17:20.156
after the victory party, you and I
could go out on a date or something.

17:23.701 --> 17:26.621
I wonder what Geraldo would do
in this situation?

17:26.704 --> 17:29.373
He'd go for it. Definitely.

17:31.834 --> 17:33.919
The comedy of politics...

17:39.091 --> 17:40.217
Hi.

17:40.301 --> 17:41.385
He's over there.

17:41.469 --> 17:43.846
Yes, I am his sister,
anything else you wanna know?

17:45.139 --> 17:46.599
Not really.

17:47.057 --> 17:49.602
Hi, Michael. I'm sorry.

17:50.019 --> 17:53.606
This election stuff is just so
taking over the school.

17:54.190 --> 17:57.735
I'm kind of sick of politics myself.

18:01.488 --> 18:02.990
So what you doing? Homework?

18:03.073 --> 18:07.828
No, work hopefully.
Probably just a bunch of pitiful jokes.

18:07.953 --> 18:09.580
You do that stuff?

18:09.663 --> 18:11.999
Well, I'm trying to get on
Amateur Night at this club.

18:12.082 --> 18:13.417
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.252
- Oh.
- Kelly, hi.

18:17.046 --> 18:20.090
Look, I need to go, okay? See you.

18:20.799 --> 18:22.468
Keep up the work.

18:22.593 --> 18:23.677
Bye.

18:24.845 --> 18:26.930
Brenda, how could you do that with him
in public?

18:27.014 --> 18:28.682
Kelly, Michael and I were just talking.

18:28.807 --> 18:30.517
Michael Miller is Brandon's opponent.

18:30.601 --> 18:32.144
I know that. So what?

18:32.227 --> 18:34.188
So, I hope you didn't tell him anything.

18:34.271 --> 18:36.315
Kelly, he was interested in me.

18:36.398 --> 18:38.400
Right, Brenda. Grow up.

18:42.195 --> 18:44.406
"The image-fest of teenage politics."

18:44.489 --> 18:45.991
"Those guys are trying to act like adults,

18:46.074 --> 18:49.077
"but they pick immature adults
to act like."

18:49.661 --> 18:51.705
It isn't working, is it?

18:52.414 --> 18:55.792
No, take it further. Make them

18:55.876 --> 18:58.420
kiddies in playpens being politicians.

19:00.589 --> 19:02.632
Elect me! Stuff like that.

19:02.799 --> 19:05.510
That's great. How do you learn
to bring all that stuff together?

19:05.594 --> 19:07.637
It just takes practice.

19:08.013 --> 19:11.975
My first bit was so pretentious,
I pretended somebody else wrote it.

19:12.100 --> 19:13.518
Try getting a little more personal.

19:13.602 --> 19:16.980
The trick is to unlearn
everything you've learnt.

19:17.272 --> 19:20.275
It took me years of performing
to get there.

19:23.945 --> 19:26.740
Rumor has it, that some things
you learn with Jack,

19:26.823 --> 19:28.908
you never wanna unlearn.

19:29.534 --> 19:31.119
Are you two...

19:31.286 --> 19:34.748
No way.
Even good sex ruins a good friendship.

19:40.503 --> 19:44.591
Listen, Jack,
I really hate to ask you this, believe me,

19:45.300 --> 19:48.469
but it's family crisis time again.
I've gotta go up to Modesto.

19:48.553 --> 19:52.015
Forget it. Every time I house-sit for you,
we wind up in a fight.

19:52.140 --> 19:55.059
"You didn't water the plants,
you forgot to feed the yuppie."

19:55.143 --> 19:56.769
- The guppy.
- Whatever.

19:56.853 --> 20:00.356
If you need a house sitter,
I might have a candidate.

20:23.546 --> 20:25.131
Enlighten me.
What does this have to do

20:25.214 --> 20:26.674
with the high school election?

20:26.799 --> 20:29.719
You told me that girls vote
more than guys.

20:31.887 --> 20:33.306
<i>And he can deliver.</i>

20:36.434 --> 20:37.935
"Bran the Man"?

20:38.102 --> 20:39.562
What? What are you gonna deliver?

20:39.645 --> 20:41.856
I mean, you haven't told us
what you're gonna do.

20:41.939 --> 20:45.067
Well, that's the beauty of it.
He doesn't say anything.

20:45.151 --> 20:47.445
Brandon, how could you do this
to our campaign?

20:47.528 --> 20:49.447
Hey, we all want to win, Andrea.

20:49.530 --> 20:51.282
No, wrong. Not me.

20:51.365 --> 20:55.327
Suddenly, there's a small part of me
that wants you to lose.

20:55.911 --> 20:57.204
Where are you going?

20:57.288 --> 21:01.083
<i>To grab a submarine sandwich
and rent Sex, Lies and Videotape.</i>

21:01.333 --> 21:03.627
You're on your own, Bran-Man.

21:05.629 --> 21:07.298
She deserted me.

21:07.423 --> 21:10.092
Well, I'm still here.

21:15.222 --> 21:17.641
I don't know, maybe she's right.

21:17.933 --> 21:19.643
Listen, Brandon,

21:21.228 --> 21:23.939
if you really want something,

21:24.690 --> 21:26.775
you have to go after it.

21:27.151 --> 21:28.360
Hard.

21:33.323 --> 21:35.868
You know, Steve wouldn't like this.

21:35.951 --> 21:39.246
Well, Steve's off chasing
some girl in orange this week.

21:39.329 --> 21:42.749
But he would love to be
in your position right now.

21:46.211 --> 21:49.298
Hi, we were just taking a break.

21:50.215 --> 21:54.219
Hey, listen, don't mind me. It's fine.
I've moved past all this.

21:54.845 --> 21:56.221
Excuse us.

21:56.346 --> 21:58.306
Oh, go ahead.
Play your little political games

21:58.390 --> 21:59.975
in your kindergarten-like world.

22:00.058 --> 22:02.853
I'm off to experience the real thing.

22:04.771 --> 22:06.523
What was that all about?

22:06.606 --> 22:08.191
I have no idea.

22:11.486 --> 22:14.489
Oh, hi, honey.
We didn't know you were back.

22:15.448 --> 22:18.994
Surprise. Anyway, I'm not

22:19.452 --> 22:20.912
for very long.

22:20.996 --> 22:22.789
What are you doing?

22:23.415 --> 22:25.000
I'm moving out.

22:37.554 --> 22:38.847
Brandon?

22:39.222 --> 22:41.141
In Brenda's room, Mom.

22:41.474 --> 22:43.309
Here are the flyers.

22:43.393 --> 22:45.562
I should have a sign like McDonald's,

22:45.895 --> 22:47.939
"over five billion copied."

22:48.022 --> 22:50.525
And I'm the McCandidate. Thanks.

22:51.317 --> 22:54.612
You know it's kind of weird
not having Brenda around.

22:54.696 --> 22:57.574
Although I do kind of like the extra room.

22:57.657 --> 23:01.035
I can't believe you guys just let her
go off by herself.

23:01.119 --> 23:02.579
Me, neither.

23:03.496 --> 23:04.789
Are we doing the right thing?

23:04.914 --> 23:06.708
Honey, what choice did we have?

23:06.791 --> 23:07.917
She was determined.

23:08.001 --> 23:10.962
And we'd already said no
about the high school equivalency thing.

23:11.045 --> 23:13.423
Well, it's only for three days.

23:13.965 --> 23:16.092
Suppose she decides to stay longer.

23:16.175 --> 23:18.720
We drag her back home immediately.

23:19.887 --> 23:22.598
Well, at least the apartment's
in a safe area.

23:22.682 --> 23:25.101
And we can drive by
and check up on her.

23:25.184 --> 23:26.936
When Brenda gets it in her head
to do something,

23:27.019 --> 23:30.648
trying to stop her just makes it
all the more attractive.

23:30.731 --> 23:32.608
When you're a kid,
you just wanna grow up.

23:32.692 --> 23:35.486
And when you're older,
all you want to do is be a kid again.

23:36.070 --> 23:39.156
How did you ever convince your parents
to let you stay?

23:39.240 --> 23:41.575
I promised to call a lot.

23:41.826 --> 23:44.578
Actually, it wasn't that hard.
It kind of freaked me out.

23:44.662 --> 23:47.748
Maybe they've just been so focused
on Brandon that it slipped right by them.

23:47.832 --> 23:51.127
Oh, come on, I doubt that.
You're pretty special.

23:51.252 --> 23:54.422
Yeah. Well, they only let me out
for three days.

23:54.547 --> 23:55.673
Yeah.

23:55.756 --> 23:59.718
Oh, okay, let's get organized, locks,

24:00.052 --> 24:03.973
you gotta jiggle them. Sort of like that.

24:04.265 --> 24:05.975
Here's the keys.

24:06.058 --> 24:08.227
You guys be kind to Brenda.

24:08.435 --> 24:12.648
All right, here is Shakespeare,
and this is his lean cuisine.

24:12.731 --> 24:13.816
Yeah.

24:14.066 --> 24:15.442
All right.

24:18.070 --> 24:20.614
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

24:23.575 --> 24:24.702
Bye.

25:07.369 --> 25:10.247
It's brilliant.
I wish I could take credit for it.

25:10.330 --> 25:11.832
Oh, you have credit with me.

25:11.915 --> 25:14.376
Now, here's what we want to discuss
in tomorrow's debate.

25:14.459 --> 25:17.003
Kelly, I'm monitoring that debate.

25:17.379 --> 25:20.841
- We have to play by Robert's Rules.
- Of course we do.

25:22.843 --> 25:25.220
My phone number's on the back.

25:27.097 --> 25:28.348
Brutal.

25:29.724 --> 25:31.476
How you doing? Brandon Walsh.

25:31.559 --> 25:34.437
I am glad to meet you.
You're gonna vote for me, right?

25:34.521 --> 25:35.772
Right. I like the button.

25:35.939 --> 25:37.691
Keep wearing that.

25:37.983 --> 25:39.859
Brandon hates that jerk.

25:39.943 --> 25:42.821
Yeah. Well, jerks are voters, too.

25:43.780 --> 25:47.075
I can't believe he'd let himself
get manipulated this way.

25:47.158 --> 25:49.994
Yeah. Major integrity loss.

25:52.789 --> 25:55.041
Oh, no, here comes Svengali.

25:56.543 --> 25:58.795
Brenda, how can you wear
that costume?

25:58.878 --> 26:03.341
Well, Kelly, you put one arm through
one sleeve and one through the other.

26:04.217 --> 26:07.095
Brandon Walsh.
Hey, I'm glad to meet you.

26:08.346 --> 26:10.682
Hey, if it isn't Bran the Man.

26:12.350 --> 26:14.894
First of all, hippie witch is out.

26:15.269 --> 26:17.563
<i>It's not hippie witch, it's Twin Peaks,
and it's very in,</i>

26:17.647 --> 26:18.731
but that doesn't matter.

26:18.856 --> 26:21.609
What does matter is that
it'll hurt Brandon.

26:21.692 --> 26:24.153
Just till elections, okay, Bren?

26:25.113 --> 26:27.198
So, you coming to the campaign party
at Donna's tonight?

26:27.281 --> 26:29.784
We're gonna show
the new improved campaign video.

26:29.867 --> 26:32.453
Yeah, I got the gist. We love him.

26:33.746 --> 26:36.249
Actually, I'd love to,
but I have to feed Sky's fish.

26:36.332 --> 26:38.042
Sounds thrilling.

26:38.334 --> 26:39.919
Well, Kelly,
when you're finally on your own,

26:40.002 --> 26:42.964
you'll understand
having responsibilities.

26:53.099 --> 26:55.017
Sky, you back early?

26:56.352 --> 26:57.770
Oh, my God.

27:02.566 --> 27:04.568
Hey, what are you doing?

27:05.820 --> 27:09.573
Nothing.
Look, I didn't see anything really,

27:09.657 --> 27:11.617
'cause I have awful, awful eyesight.

27:11.700 --> 27:13.953
So I'll be leaving now.
Take anything you want.

27:14.036 --> 27:17.831
Hey, lady, we don't need your
permission to repossess these goodies.

27:17.915 --> 27:21.001
Repossess? Hey, put it back!

27:21.794 --> 27:23.921
At least let me call first.

27:33.430 --> 27:35.766
Hi, this is Brenda,
I'm house-sitting for Sky.

27:35.849 --> 27:37.851
Did she leave a number?

27:37.976 --> 27:39.436
Is Jack there?

27:40.854 --> 27:42.439
Thanks, anyway.

27:44.900 --> 27:47.194
Just following orders, ma'am.

27:58.455 --> 28:00.332
There's nothing left!

28:04.419 --> 28:06.088
You're something.

28:07.631 --> 28:09.007
They took everything.

28:09.132 --> 28:11.510
I know. I saw them cruise by.

28:11.927 --> 28:13.637
It's pretty awful.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.389
- Poor Sky.
- Yeah.

28:16.765 --> 28:19.309
Well, at least it's only things.

28:20.102 --> 28:21.895
We've got what's important.

28:21.978 --> 28:23.063
You.

28:23.355 --> 28:24.481
Me.

28:25.774 --> 28:27.943
Franco-American spaghetti.

28:33.531 --> 28:35.158
Let's see here.

28:38.912 --> 28:41.373
Seems like the gas company's
in a snit, too.

28:41.456 --> 28:43.875
It's gotta be a misunderstanding.

28:44.125 --> 28:45.627
It always is.

28:45.919 --> 28:49.547
Hey, we don't have to be slaves
to the powers that be.

28:49.839 --> 28:51.216
We've got food.

28:51.299 --> 28:53.301
Yeah, right. Food for the fish.

28:53.384 --> 28:55.261
No, for the mind.

28:57.055 --> 29:00.016
We'll imagine
a spectacular romantic dinner.

29:01.142 --> 29:02.352
Come on.

29:06.940 --> 29:08.233
What's going on?

29:08.316 --> 29:09.984
Dinner is now a dinner party.

29:10.068 --> 29:12.570
Kelly, I'm not in the mood
for a surprise party.

29:12.654 --> 29:14.072
This party is for Brandon.

29:14.155 --> 29:17.784
So this is the fish you're feeding
while the cat's away.

29:18.826 --> 29:19.911
Kelly!

29:19.994 --> 29:23.539
Hey, Bren, Donna's parents bailed when
they found how many people we invited.

29:23.623 --> 29:24.749
How many?

29:24.832 --> 29:27.543
Don't worry, they all won't show up.

29:29.712 --> 29:31.214
Bran the Man!

29:31.297 --> 29:32.340
Bren the woman.

29:33.674 --> 29:35.927
Sara, I want you to meet my best buddy,
Brandon Walsh,

29:36.010 --> 29:37.970
soon to be Class President.

29:38.054 --> 29:39.931
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. How you doing? Orange, huh?

29:40.014 --> 29:42.475
It's my favorite color and fruit.

29:43.351 --> 29:44.519
Thanks.

29:44.602 --> 29:48.439
Where's the bedroom?
All right, I'll find it by myself.

29:53.277 --> 29:56.238
He has a talent for that.
Where's the food?

29:56.697 --> 29:58.282
You know Kelly,
if I'd known you were coming,

29:58.366 --> 29:59.784
I would have stocked the place for you.

29:59.867 --> 30:03.120
Well, I tried calling,
but the phone was disconnected.

30:03.204 --> 30:04.413
What?

30:07.083 --> 30:08.667
There is no food.

30:13.339 --> 30:14.757
That's sick. Gross.

30:15.424 --> 30:17.468
There's no water, either.

30:19.303 --> 30:20.387
Hello?

30:20.804 --> 30:21.972
Hello?

30:22.514 --> 30:26.143
I'm here at the Walsh campaign party.
It's sort of a stand-up event.

30:26.310 --> 30:28.729
Everyone seems to be having
a great time.

30:28.812 --> 30:30.731
And here's the candidate's sister,

30:30.814 --> 30:33.108
the hostess with the mostest.

30:33.359 --> 30:34.652
Get out!

30:35.944 --> 30:39.782
Friends, yeomen, country club men,

30:40.282 --> 30:43.285
lend me those pierced ears. Listen up.

30:43.994 --> 30:47.831
How many of you really know
what this candidate stands for?

30:48.582 --> 30:51.043
Do you even know anymore, Brandon?

30:51.126 --> 30:55.589
I mean, you've sort of turned into
this processed candidate, haven't you?

30:55.672 --> 30:58.675
David, why don't we turn on
the video, okay?

30:59.051 --> 31:00.761
She wants me, bad.

31:09.645 --> 31:10.854
Great!

31:12.648 --> 31:16.276
No manager is listed.
What do I do, ring all the bells?

31:16.610 --> 31:18.528
Low rent city, Brenda.

31:18.737 --> 31:21.281
- You're welcome, Steve.
- Brenda, where's the fuse box?

31:21.364 --> 31:22.949
Fuse box, I don't know.

31:23.033 --> 31:24.367
Everyone's meeting
at the Peach Pit, okay?

31:24.451 --> 31:25.535
Okay.

31:25.619 --> 31:27.829
Brenda, you really have
the apartment from hell. No offence.

31:27.913 --> 31:31.416
You know, you guys just burst in,
not even thinking that I might have a life,

31:31.500 --> 31:33.210
just assuming that it would be okay.

31:33.293 --> 31:35.128
You know, you could've been
a little more supportive

31:35.212 --> 31:36.755
and offered the apartment.

31:36.838 --> 31:38.256
What about you, Brandon?

31:38.340 --> 31:41.301
You've been so self-absorbed
and taken my friends with you.

31:41.384 --> 31:42.844
I didn't take anyone.

31:42.928 --> 31:45.805
You are the one who ditched me
for the ever-groovy Sky and Jack.

31:45.889 --> 31:48.016
You know, it just bugs you, Kelly,
when I get attention.

31:48.099 --> 31:50.060
So you decide to console yourself
on Brandon.

31:50.143 --> 31:51.478
Oh, come on, Brenda!

31:51.561 --> 31:53.146
Look, you guys have been
passing me right by.

31:53.229 --> 31:54.981
Why don't you just keep on going
and leave me alone?

31:55.065 --> 31:57.067
- Brenda!
- Don't do this now.

31:57.150 --> 31:59.986
Why?
Is it bad timing for your campaign?

32:01.738 --> 32:04.491
I've gotta go now.
You sure you don't want to come?

32:04.657 --> 32:08.036
I don't think I even want to vote.
You know what, Brandon?

32:08.870 --> 32:12.498
You might really have what it takes
to be a politician.

32:18.546 --> 32:23.426
Looks like the party's over.
Imagine me gone, sweet Brenda.

32:35.772 --> 32:39.650
<i>Prick up your ears!
The great debate starts in five minutes.</i>

32:40.777 --> 32:42.904
<i>Tomorrow is election day</i>

32:42.987 --> 32:44.572
<i>and date night.</i>

32:45.615 --> 32:46.782
<i>Five minutes.</i>

32:46.866 --> 32:49.035
- You guys, we are in great shape.
- Yeah?

32:49.118 --> 32:52.496
Oh, definitely. All the girls in PE class,
they're all voting for you.

32:52.580 --> 32:53.998
Better crank together a victory speech.

32:54.081 --> 32:58.252
Because your pal Steve here
is gonna make sure it's a done deal.

32:58.336 --> 33:00.713
Maybe I should talk about some of the
community programs

33:00.796 --> 33:02.173
I want to set up.

33:02.256 --> 33:05.134
Let's wait till you're in office
to make that stuff happen.

33:05.259 --> 33:08.137
But first, you have to win. All right?

33:09.305 --> 33:10.347
Yes.

33:13.142 --> 33:14.727
Well, I guess this is the place.

33:14.810 --> 33:17.229
Hey, if it isn't Bran the Man.

33:17.772 --> 33:19.273
So, you ready?

33:19.356 --> 33:22.276
Yeah, not that it matters.

33:23.068 --> 33:25.487
Hey, it ain't over till it's over.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.781
Spoken like a true novice.

33:28.741 --> 33:30.701
You know,
I'm a veteran of these campaigns,

33:30.784 --> 33:34.788
and my prediction is you'll end up
with about 80% of the vote.

33:34.955 --> 33:36.373
Well, that's optimistic.

33:36.457 --> 33:38.500
Listen, when you've lost
as many times as I have,

33:38.584 --> 33:41.962
you begin to develop an instinct
for these things.

33:42.588 --> 33:45.257
You're real popular and I don't mean

33:45.340 --> 33:48.469
you're an airhead or anything, I just...

33:52.556 --> 33:56.185
I have never seen anyone
mount a slicker campaign.

33:57.853 --> 34:01.982
Thanks, but no one's gonna vote
for a president

34:02.065 --> 34:05.736
just because they like their video,
or they shouldn't.

34:05.861 --> 34:08.487
You've got a lot going for you, Mike.

34:08.572 --> 34:09.739
What?

34:10.324 --> 34:14.661
Well, like it says right here, all the
extracurricular activities you've done.

34:14.786 --> 34:18.081
Your volunteer work.
You're in the Honors Society.

34:18.665 --> 34:20.708
You're really qualified.

34:21.501 --> 34:24.254
You were even a student intern
at the state capital last summer.

34:24.379 --> 34:27.507
You know,
I am real interested in public policy,

34:27.591 --> 34:29.509
especially since it affects the homeless.

34:29.592 --> 34:31.094
Yeah, me, too.

34:31.511 --> 34:33.472
I was thinking of a program
where we could give away

34:33.554 --> 34:34.889
the surplus food from the cafeteria.

34:34.973 --> 34:36.183
That's great!

34:36.266 --> 34:38.101
And so when you get elected,
you can use

34:38.185 --> 34:40.312
the pilot program
I set up last summer.

34:40.395 --> 34:41.813
Thanks, man.

34:45.065 --> 34:47.360
May the better candidate win.

34:47.944 --> 34:49.404
Same to you.

34:52.032 --> 34:55.118
<i>Mr Walsh, your proposals, please.</i>

34:56.786 --> 35:01.624
<i>My first order of business will be
to get rock bands every Friday at lunch.</i>

35:15.096 --> 35:17.724
<i>How do you plan to implement this?</i>

35:21.019 --> 35:22.770
<i>Well,</i>

35:24.606 --> 35:26.774
<i>contact the bands.</i>

35:27.567 --> 35:30.153
<i>It's a little more complicated than that.</i>

35:30.236 --> 35:34.699
<i>There are releases and permits
and insurance.</i>

35:35.783 --> 35:38.661
<i>When I was Assistant
Activities Committee Chairman,</i>

35:38.745 --> 35:41.247
<i>I brought bands in for the proms.</i>

35:42.415 --> 35:45.293
<i>Are you aware
of all the red tape involved?</i>

35:53.926 --> 35:56.345
<i>No, not really.</i>

36:00.850 --> 36:02.184
<i>But you are.</i>

36:09.650 --> 36:12.903
<i>And that's just one of about 50 reasons
why you're more qualified</i>

36:12.987 --> 36:15.156
<i>to be president than I am.</i>

36:20.619 --> 36:23.873
<i>And you've certainly run
a more honorable campaign.</i>

36:23.998 --> 36:27.001
What is he doing?
This is not in our script.

36:28.669 --> 36:30.713
<i>And that's the reason why</i>

36:30.796 --> 36:33.215
<i>I'm throwing my support to you,</i>

36:36.802 --> 36:38.345
<i>Mr President.</i>

36:50.524 --> 36:53.944
I cannot believe that
I wasted two weeks of my life on this.

36:54.027 --> 36:57.072
Brandon, you blew it.
I was gonna stuff the ballot box for you.

36:57.156 --> 37:00.033
Well, it's the thought that counts, Steve.

37:00.492 --> 37:03.203
So, maybe you're redeemable after all.

37:04.371 --> 37:08.876
It's too bad you're still not running.
I might have even voted for you.

37:09.293 --> 37:12.170
Thanks, Brenda.
I can always count on you.

37:12.796 --> 37:15.757
Um, Brenda, listen. Um...

37:17.426 --> 37:19.136
So, how's apartment life?

37:19.219 --> 37:20.929
Pretty powerless.

37:22.222 --> 37:23.849
Do you wanna hang out tonight?

37:23.932 --> 37:25.142
I can't.

37:25.225 --> 37:28.645
I have to practice something that
I'm writing for Audition Night at the club,

37:28.729 --> 37:29.938
maybe.

37:30.355 --> 37:33.942
So Kel, see you in something wet.

37:34.025 --> 37:36.862
Just you, me,

37:36.945 --> 37:39.364
and my dad's hot tub.

37:39.865 --> 37:42.617
The campaign debt nightmare begins.

37:45.036 --> 37:48.456
You know, Kelly kept talking about
whether or not I wanted to win,

37:48.540 --> 37:51.960
but I just didn't want to win that way.

37:54.462 --> 37:58.383
Anyway, I can always run
a different campaign next semester.

37:58.550 --> 38:00.260
I'm proud of you.

38:00.677 --> 38:04.431
Now I can tell you honestly,
I hated your campaign video.

38:06.349 --> 38:07.684
So did I.

38:08.935 --> 38:10.228
So did I.

38:10.603 --> 38:13.148
- Brenda. Come on in.
- Hey, stranger.

38:13.523 --> 38:15.567
Hi, sweetheart. How are you?

38:15.650 --> 38:18.820
Make yourself at home.
You know what I mean.

38:19.362 --> 38:21.197
You want a sandwich?

38:22.991 --> 38:25.326
- Do you have tuna?
- Oh, you bet.

38:25.451 --> 38:27.370
Sprouts and tomatoes?

38:40.466 --> 38:43.886
- Wow, it's so supplied.
- Oh, it's always like this.

38:44.178 --> 38:45.847
Yeah, I guess so.

38:45.972 --> 38:48.099
Are you really back home?

38:49.684 --> 38:53.563
- I... I...
- Yes? Yes, honey?

38:55.523 --> 38:58.276
I just came to get some clean clothes.

38:58.484 --> 39:01.195
And I need to know where
my high school equivalency form is.

39:01.279 --> 39:03.197
Now, Brenda, we told you to forget that.

39:03.281 --> 39:05.074
There is no way
we're gonna sign that, honey.

39:05.658 --> 39:08.202
Guys, I just asked you where it was.

39:14.250 --> 39:15.793
This is killing me.

39:15.918 --> 39:18.796
Let's just stop this farce
and beg her to come back.

39:18.879 --> 39:22.425
No, let's drag her back
and tell her how much we missed her.

39:22.508 --> 39:26.887
No, wait. We've got to resist
the urge to nurture her right now.

39:26.971 --> 39:28.013
That's right.

39:28.097 --> 39:30.182
Restraint. Control.

39:33.435 --> 39:36.230
- What are you doing?
- Care package for Brenda.

39:36.313 --> 39:37.481
Right.

39:43.112 --> 39:44.863
Oh, God, what now?

39:46.365 --> 39:47.408
Hi.

39:52.121 --> 39:53.872
I know, I'm sorry.

39:54.373 --> 39:56.333
I tried to get them to leave the furniture.

39:56.417 --> 39:59.253
No, I know. It's not your fault.

40:00.170 --> 40:02.589
Your apartment still looks cool.

40:02.798 --> 40:05.426
Things aren't always what they seem.

40:08.762 --> 40:11.056
It's really hard on your own.

40:12.850 --> 40:16.311
I didn't wanna tell you,
'cause you looked up to me.

40:16.562 --> 40:18.480
You made me feel so up.

40:21.400 --> 40:22.901
Tell me what?

40:23.694 --> 40:25.904
You know why I had to go home
to my parents?

40:26.029 --> 40:28.448
You know what
the big family crisis was?

40:28.532 --> 40:29.574
Me.

40:30.492 --> 40:32.077
I needed money.

40:32.953 --> 40:35.497
I'm what you call
plain old over-extended.

40:35.580 --> 40:37.582
Is everything okay now?

40:38.333 --> 40:40.669
Well, compared to the homeless, yeah.

40:40.752 --> 40:43.380
Compared to my dreams, not exactly.

40:43.755 --> 40:44.965
My parents are getting older

40:45.048 --> 40:47.759
and they just don't have it
to give anymore.

40:47.843 --> 40:49.719
But you've got a job.

40:51.221 --> 40:53.181
Tips from starving artists,
myself included,

40:53.265 --> 40:55.475
don't exactly pay the bills.

40:57.519 --> 40:59.187
I refuse to cry.

41:00.063 --> 41:02.232
Sometimes it's good to cry.

41:02.983 --> 41:06.277
Look, you're more than welcome to stay,

41:06.361 --> 41:10.824
but I don't blame you if you want
to leave this depressing floor plan.

41:11.574 --> 41:14.494
You're not getting rid of me that easily.

41:16.121 --> 41:17.247
Well, I got an idea.

41:17.330 --> 41:20.959
Why don't you stay here
and I'll move in with your mom.

41:25.755 --> 41:27.131
<i>Wake up, Fallout victims!</i>

41:27.215 --> 41:29.759
<i>It's Amateur Night
and anything can happen.</i>

41:31.052 --> 41:32.428
<i>Anything at all!</i>

41:32.512 --> 41:35.556
- I can't go through with this.
- Yes, you can.

41:35.848 --> 41:40.395
No, I can't. Sky, you don't know
what I wrote. It's so personal.

41:41.270 --> 41:44.148
This is all about finding yourself, kid.

41:47.652 --> 41:51.322
<i>I was thinking of taking my</i>

41:51.406 --> 41:53.449
<i>high school equivalency test,</i>

41:54.325 --> 41:57.495
<i>getting my own place,
being oh-so-independent.</i>

41:57.703 --> 41:59.997
<i>Where do I shop? Mom's.</i>

42:02.708 --> 42:04.752
<i>Hey, the price is right.</i>

42:07.838 --> 42:09.966
<i>You know, you think when you leave,</i>

42:10.049 --> 42:11.842
<i>they're gonna run after you.</i>

42:11.926 --> 42:13.678
<i>Well, think again.</i>

42:13.844 --> 42:16.138
<i>My brother, my twin brother,
my other half,</i>

42:16.222 --> 42:18.557
<i>he takes over my entire room,</i>

42:18.641 --> 42:21.352
<i>double the space, double the pleasure.</i>

42:23.229 --> 42:24.939
<i>Are my parents freaked
about my absence?</i>

42:25.147 --> 42:29.151
<i>Do they yell? No. They're nice.</i>

42:29.276 --> 42:33.239
<i>It made me want to say,
"Wait. I don't want to grow up yet."</i>

42:35.199 --> 42:39.078
<i>You know, being on your own
doesn't necessarily mean</i>

42:39.161 --> 42:42.832
<i>having your own place,
it's about being your own person.</i>

42:44.250 --> 42:47.127
<i>It's pretty easy to glom on to
someone else, but...</i>

42:47.211 --> 42:48.837
<i>Problem is that
once you're inside that person,</i>

42:48.921 --> 42:52.508
<i>no matter how cool they are,
you just want to say,</i>

42:52.841 --> 42:55.260
<i>"Wait! Let me out! I want me!"</i>

42:56.679 --> 42:58.222
<i>You know what,</i>

42:58.681 --> 43:01.141
<i>I think I found me right up here.</i>

43:01.225 --> 43:02.893
- This is great.
- Yeah.

43:03.102 --> 43:06.814
<i>So, I've decided not to put
my high school career on fast forward.</i>

43:06.897 --> 43:08.065
- Good choice.
- All right. All right.

43:08.148 --> 43:09.733
<i>I need some practice
being my own person</i>

43:09.817 --> 43:11.944
<i>before I'm actually on my own.</i>

43:12.027 --> 43:13.487
- It's better.
- Yeah, this is a smart lady.

43:14.613 --> 43:16.698
<i>Thank you for listening.</i>

43:25.499 --> 43:27.584
Honey, you were terrific.

43:30.128 --> 43:32.422
How did you guys know to come?

43:34.591 --> 43:36.301
Safety in numbers.

43:39.388 --> 43:41.348
Don't press your luck.

43:44.851 --> 43:47.854
So, you serious about going back
to high school?

43:47.938 --> 43:49.940
Yes, Dad, I'm going to
stay in school forever.

43:50.065 --> 43:52.776
You're going to have to
support me until I'm 90.

43:52.859 --> 43:54.903
I've got to go talk to Sky.

43:54.986 --> 43:56.238
See you.

43:58.365 --> 44:00.575
You were so great up there.

44:01.993 --> 44:04.204
Well, you're now officially
a Fallout victim.

44:04.287 --> 44:07.332
It's not an easy life,
but the right delivery helps.

44:07.415 --> 44:09.751
Why, thank you. I'm flattered.

44:10.460 --> 44:14.714
Listen, if you're not gonna use that
high school equivalency exam,

44:14.798 --> 44:16.508
could I have it?

44:17.675 --> 44:20.095
I'd never leave home without it.

44:24.057 --> 44:26.684
- Hey, wait for me.
- Come on.

44:26.976 --> 44:29.145
- Bren.
- All right.

44:29.854 --> 44:32.440
I put on clean sheets, just in case.

44:32.524 --> 44:33.816
Thanks.

44:35.235 --> 44:37.111
Welcome home, honey.

44:37.820 --> 44:41.241
You know, I could definitely get used
to this guest treatment.

44:41.324 --> 44:43.034
- Good night.
- Night.

44:43.117 --> 44:44.494
Good night.

44:44.619 --> 44:49.415
I could never get used to the smell
of the cigarette smoke in those clubs.

44:49.624 --> 44:51.501
You know, I'm jealous.

44:52.669 --> 44:54.754
You had a good experience.

44:54.962 --> 44:58.508
You got to hang in a cool apartment,
you found a talent.

44:58.591 --> 45:00.426
Yeah, I guess I did.

45:01.469 --> 45:04.347
And you walked away
from the Oval Office.

45:05.264 --> 45:07.809
Yeah, well, I did learn something.

45:08.142 --> 45:11.229
And what's that pearl of wisdom,
your lowness?

45:12.230 --> 45:14.982
I loved having the bathroom to myself.

45:15.399 --> 45:17.568
Well, those days are over.

45:22.865 --> 45:25.284
Will you autograph this for me?

45:26.305 --> 45:32.594
