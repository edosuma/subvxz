01:01.884 --> 01:04.828
...terminal A
of Boston International Airport.

01:04.929 --> 01:08.009
Transportation between terminals...

01:14.956 --> 01:17.849
Take your laptop out of your bag.

01:35.501 --> 01:38.831
The Boston Police Department requests
that for your safety and security

01:38.931 --> 01:40.923
and per FAA regulations...

02:03.604 --> 02:05.414
I'll be home in a few.

02:05.514 --> 02:08.633
Get off in about an hour.
Space cadet, get me a...

02:08.734 --> 02:11.996
...to go in this quarter.
They need to score on this drive.

02:24.525 --> 02:28.128
Don't lie to me, okay?
You sound like one of my kids.

02:32.449 --> 02:34.193
Gate number 26.

02:34.293 --> 02:37.269
Miss Lauren Goodwin,
please report to gate number 26.

02:53.562 --> 02:56.857
Elizabitch, get your bony ass over here.

02:56.957 --> 02:59.185
- What is going on?
- Don't hang up on her.

02:59.285 --> 03:03.270
...your baggage can be claimed
at carousel number three. Please...

03:03.614 --> 03:07.501
Put security cameras in the whole house.
Except for the bedroom.

03:07.601 --> 03:09.904
Christie wouldn't go for that.

03:11.104 --> 03:13.490
My pool cleaner's even gone rogue.

03:14.590 --> 03:18.020
No, I'm serious. Yeah,
it's jumping out of the pool on its own.

03:18.120 --> 03:21.415
There is a flight 3598 to Manchester,
New Hampshire.

03:21.515 --> 03:24.460
Your gate number
has been changed to gate A6.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.054
The flight will depart
on time at 4:15 P.M.

03:28.154 --> 03:31.567
Passengers on flight 3598 to Manchester,
New Hampshire,

03:31.667 --> 03:35.196
your gate number has been changed...

03:38.581 --> 03:41.667
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. Just got off the plane.

03:41.767 --> 03:43.186
What are you doing?

03:43.286 --> 03:46.065
What am I doing?
I'm picking up Johnny at school.

03:46.165 --> 03:48.217
I'm getting a sitter from the bus stop.

03:48.317 --> 03:50.736
Going back to the lab
because we got completely slammed.

03:50.836 --> 03:55.307
Sharon, they made an offer.
A big, big offer.

03:55.707 --> 03:57.701
For all the rights to "Night Traveler."

03:57.801 --> 04:00.096
We're talking about graphic platforms,

04:00.196 --> 04:04.491
virtual reality, algorithms,
interface user stuff, I don't know.

04:04.591 --> 04:08.012
That's amazing, Clay. Congratulations.

04:08.412 --> 04:11.807
Yeah. Well, you know,
it's a big deal, yeah.

04:11.907 --> 04:15.494
So are you going out to celebrate tonight?

04:15.594 --> 04:17.963
Celebrate? Celebrate, no.

04:18.063 --> 04:20.317
Yeah, this is a big night for you.

04:20.416 --> 04:23.059
I just assumed you'd want
to celebrate with someone.

04:23.159 --> 04:24.862
Not really.

04:25.162 --> 04:27.367
So you're not with someone?

04:27.467 --> 04:29.783
No. No.

04:29.883 --> 04:32.018
There's nobody.

04:32.118 --> 04:36.215
Hey, is that Dad? Can I talk to him?

04:43.922 --> 04:47.042
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, buddy.

04:47.142 --> 04:50.036
- How you doing?
- We did the parachute drill today.

04:50.136 --> 04:52.381
- Yeah.
- You put a little parachute on your bat.

04:52.481 --> 04:54.851
I swear,
my swing is like 100 times faster.

04:54.951 --> 04:56.502
That's great.

04:56.902 --> 04:59.038
Are you coming home?

05:00.288 --> 05:03.073
- Yeah, yeah, soon.
- I just want you to come home.

05:03.173 --> 05:05.326
Ah, shit.

05:44.791 --> 05:49.320
Hi, Shar, it's me.
Yeah, I ran out of juice.

05:49.420 --> 05:53.810
Listen, there's a flight to Manchester
that leaves in about an hour.

05:53.910 --> 05:56.495
Clay, you've been gone for over a year.

05:56.595 --> 05:59.331
I love you, but it's not that simple.

05:59.431 --> 06:02.919
- I'd like to see my son. Shit.
- Your time is up.

06:03.019 --> 06:05.922
- I need more money. Hold on.
- Please deposit...

06:31.055 --> 06:33.390
What's wrong with you? Stop it!

06:35.934 --> 06:39.462
Get off him! What are you doing? Get off!

06:56.388 --> 06:58.832
Get off of her!

07:04.280 --> 07:06.414
Stop that!

07:12.412 --> 07:14.964
Go! Go! Go!

07:20.471 --> 07:23.498
Oh, my God, Chloe.

07:24.332 --> 07:25.609
Hey, hey, hey, don't touch her.

07:25.709 --> 07:27.936
- I'm not gonna touch her.
- She might be contagious.

07:28.036 --> 07:30.561
I need to call 911, though.

07:31.061 --> 07:32.991
911, hello?

08:15.284 --> 08:18.036
Let me see your goddamn hands!
Get your hands in the air!

08:19.813 --> 08:23.157
Why'd you do that? What, are you gonna
shoot everybody? What the hell is happening?

08:23.257 --> 08:25.639
- Who the hell knows?
- Quick, let's go.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.905
- Don't use your cell phone.
- Why?

08:28.005 --> 08:30.225
They did.

08:42.861 --> 08:45.156
Help me!

10:17.982 --> 10:22.278
- No, no, no. Bro, stop, he's normal.
- Hey, hey, hey!

10:23.178 --> 10:26.466
Come on. Let's go, bro. Bro, come on.

10:28.266 --> 10:29.977
Don't use your cell phones.

10:30.077 --> 10:32.604
We've been trying,
but we can't get a signal down here.

10:33.404 --> 10:36.292
We need to get out of this airport
right now before it burns to the ground.

10:36.392 --> 10:39.215
- Get out of here? We ain't going nowhere.
- Is there a driver on this train?

10:39.315 --> 10:42.548
- That'd be me.
- Can we leave?

10:42.648 --> 10:44.358
- No.
- Oh, no.

10:44.458 --> 10:47.169
Central shut down the power,
emergency brakes came up,

10:47.269 --> 10:49.963
and this train can't move
more than 50 feet.

10:50.063 --> 10:52.124
Shit.

10:53.424 --> 10:55.444
- We could walk.
- Walk?

10:55.544 --> 10:58.007
- Walk? Ain't nobody walking.
- What did you say?

10:58.107 --> 11:00.115
We could walk.

11:00.215 --> 11:04.620
I got maps of the system and I got all the
maintenance tunnels with the exits marked.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.491
- We can walk right out of here.
- Brilliant idea. You're my new best friend.

11:08.591 --> 11:11.568
Are you crazy? What are you gonna do
when the T starts running again?

11:11.668 --> 11:13.845
You don't want to come,
you don't got to come. I don't care.

11:13.945 --> 11:16.114
You guys are idiots.
We're safe right here.

11:16.214 --> 11:19.601
- Only if this lasts less than 24 hours.
- What do you mean?

11:19.701 --> 11:22.664
The groundwater. The sewage workers
pump out the groundwater.

11:22.764 --> 11:25.925
If nobody's manning the pumps,
whole system floods.

11:26.025 --> 11:29.971
All this'll be underwater. You'll be forced
into the terminal back out in the streets.

11:30.071 --> 11:32.673
And if Boston is still burning
or if what he's saying is true...

11:32.773 --> 11:34.901
Don't listen to him.
We're not gonna be down here that long.

11:35.001 --> 11:37.988
- Do you want to stay here or go?
- It's gonna blow over. These things always do.

11:38.088 --> 11:41.762
- Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Can I come with you?
- I'm not gonna stop you.

11:41.862 --> 11:44.994
- Yo, awesome. Deuces, man. Adios.
- You don't even know him.

11:45.894 --> 11:47.889
You think this is happening
everywhere or just here?

11:47.989 --> 11:49.748
We'll know in a little while.

11:49.848 --> 11:52.794
We lose power,
means it's happening everywhere.

11:52.894 --> 11:57.106
Nobody's manning the power stations.
Probably running for their lives like us.

11:58.206 --> 12:01.443
Wonder how many folks were
on those things when it happened.

12:01.543 --> 12:03.070
A lot.

12:03.170 --> 12:06.540
Too many. Like everybody. And those that
didn't get it the first time got zapped

12:06.640 --> 12:08.600
when they tried to call 911
or their families.

12:08.700 --> 12:10.244
Hmm.

12:11.344 --> 12:13.815
I'm Tom McCourt, by the way.

12:13.915 --> 12:16.208
Clay Riddell. Good to know you.

12:16.508 --> 12:19.378
Mike Mattick. They call me DJ Liquid.

12:19.978 --> 12:22.106
- Keep moving.
- DJ.

12:22.206 --> 12:24.402
I got to get to Kent Pond.

12:24.502 --> 12:26.890
My family is up there.
I've got a wife and son.

12:26.990 --> 12:30.347
You know, in New Hampshire. Kent Pond?
You got anybody you need to check on?

12:30.447 --> 12:32.792
- I got my boo.
- Did you say "my boo"?

12:32.892 --> 12:34.961
- Yeah, what you got, huh?
- Come on, come on.

12:35.061 --> 12:40.223
My man, he done left me,
so I ain't got nobody. I live alone.

12:45.896 --> 12:50.126
- Yo, I got service. What does that mean?
- I don't know. Put that thing down.

12:51.076 --> 12:53.288
Are they normal?

12:53.738 --> 12:55.066
They look normal to you?

12:55.166 --> 12:58.984
I don't know. You want to take
that chance? What's abnormal?

13:05.556 --> 13:08.385
Shit! Shit! Come on! Come on!

13:13.991 --> 13:17.093
Come on! Run!

13:30.599 --> 13:33.544
Come on, man. Come on.

13:38.307 --> 13:41.502
Come on! Give me your hand.
Give me your hand. Come on. Come on.

13:48.784 --> 13:52.220
The Dumpster. The Dumpster.
I got it. I got it.

14:02.223 --> 14:04.799
Go. Go.

14:16.578 --> 14:18.705
Hold it.

14:24.528 --> 14:26.830
I know her.

14:33.845 --> 14:36.958
- Okay, what floor?
- Two.

14:37.058 --> 14:40.285
Okay, go. Go.

15:04.943 --> 15:08.514
Shit, hurry up! Hurry up.

15:34.748 --> 15:36.936
Yeah, dead.

15:41.472 --> 15:44.006
Think it's safe to text?

15:44.341 --> 15:46.034
I'm out of juice.

15:46.134 --> 15:50.521
I've got to text my family, see if they're
okay. Can I borrow your phone, please?

16:16.071 --> 16:19.118
It's all jumbled up. Scrambled.

16:19.218 --> 16:23.189
Why don't you stick my phone in the freezer?
It makes the battery last longer.

16:23.289 --> 16:25.582
Probably need it to check the signal.

16:25.682 --> 16:29.244
If we don't make any calls,
it should last for a few days.

16:32.431 --> 16:34.941
You draw all these?

16:35.041 --> 16:37.912
Yeah. My graphic novel.

16:47.221 --> 16:51.650
I was thinking about that...
poor kid down in the tunnel.

16:52.450 --> 16:55.212
DJ...

16:56.212 --> 16:58.264
Liquid?

16:59.015 --> 17:01.101
God damn.

17:03.654 --> 17:06.582
You know, if we're going to survive this,
whatever it is,

17:06.982 --> 17:09.089
people are gonna have to...

17:09.190 --> 17:12.031
put aside their...

17:12.132 --> 17:15.615
finer sensibilities.

17:16.808 --> 17:19.278
If they can't...

17:20.778 --> 17:22.659
they're gonna die.

17:29.145 --> 17:30.965
Hello?

17:31.765 --> 17:34.126
- She sound normal?
- Hello?

17:34.226 --> 17:37.278
- Please, someone be there.
- Are you normal?

17:37.378 --> 17:39.565
What do you think? Open the damn door.

17:45.403 --> 17:48.190
- Okay.
- I live upstairs.

17:48.290 --> 17:51.660
Yeah, I've seen you before. I'm Clay.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.863
- Tom.
- I'm Alice.

17:53.963 --> 17:56.932
I think you guys should close the blinds.
I don't think that's smart.

17:57.032 --> 18:00.452
Close the blinds. I don't think it's gonna
be good if somebody sees us in here.

18:00.552 --> 18:02.496
He's gonna close them.

18:02.596 --> 18:05.349
Tom, you close them.
See, he's closing them.

18:06.049 --> 18:09.186
- Are you hurt?
- What do you mean, am I hurt?

18:09.286 --> 18:12.915
Are you physically injured?
Can I help you?

18:14.065 --> 18:16.751
I killed my mom.

18:17.745 --> 18:20.239
I killed my mom.

18:20.839 --> 18:24.936
I want to get out of this dress
because it really smells.

18:25.036 --> 18:28.840
Like blood and sweat and my mom's perfume.

18:28.940 --> 18:31.943
My... girlfriend
might have left some jeans.

18:32.043 --> 18:33.986
I think they'd just about fit you.

18:34.086 --> 18:37.288
And I have pajamas.
I have plenty of pajamas.

18:46.197 --> 18:50.526
- Okay?
- Yeah, I'm just tired.

18:51.026 --> 18:54.180
Here, do you want to maybe...

19:00.136 --> 19:02.589
There's still some hot water
if you want to take a shower.

19:02.689 --> 19:06.760
Uh-huh, okay. Thank you.

19:16.253 --> 19:19.957
Listen, Tom,
I'm gonna head north to Kent Pond

19:20.057 --> 19:24.871
in the morning as soon as it gets light.
I think you and Alice should come with me.

19:25.529 --> 19:28.690
Clay, I'm really sorry about your family.

19:28.790 --> 19:31.834
Don't be sorry because there's nothing
to be sorry about yet.

19:38.233 --> 19:41.913
My... kid had a cell phone,
but he never made calls.

19:42.013 --> 19:45.157
He just texted, you know? Liked games.

19:45.257 --> 19:48.694
But my wife, she had one and I called her
right before it happened.

19:48.794 --> 19:53.273
When I met you.
So I don't know if she was on it.

20:00.531 --> 20:03.824
I just want you to know I'm real glad
I ran into you today, Tom.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.960
You okay?

20:17.072 --> 20:20.576
Oh, um, I found these in your pocket.

20:20.676 --> 20:22.644
Hope you don't mind.

20:22.744 --> 20:25.471
No, no, no, no.

20:33.138 --> 20:36.768
- Here, maybe drink something.
- No.

20:36.868 --> 20:40.236
- Do you want something to eat?
- No.

20:49.162 --> 20:51.915
If you guys go somewhere,
can I come with you?

20:52.015 --> 20:54.952
- Hoping you'd say that.
- Definitely.

20:55.252 --> 20:57.120
Yeah.

20:58.789 --> 21:02.043
- I'm gonna try and get some rest now.
- Yeah, we'll be here.

21:05.946 --> 21:07.823
Yeah.

21:19.618 --> 21:21.437
So...

21:23.137 --> 21:27.868
some kind of terrorist attack
or some shit, do you think?

21:27.968 --> 21:30.403
I don't know, man.

21:31.613 --> 21:34.408
Well, whoever it was...

21:34.708 --> 21:38.436
us three are like bugs
who had the dumb luck...

21:38.536 --> 21:42.007
to avoid the stomp of the giant's foot.

23:29.765 --> 23:32.093
They're like birds.

23:32.193 --> 23:35.069
They're acting like a flock of birds.

23:39.391 --> 23:41.631
Well, I don't like it.

23:41.731 --> 23:45.638
I don't like this flocking thing at all.

23:47.132 --> 23:50.202
I mean, whatever it is,
I've just got to get to Kent Pond

23:50.302 --> 23:53.062
and find out about my wife and son.

23:54.974 --> 23:57.684
If you guys don't want to come,
I totally get it.

24:53.231 --> 24:55.691
Hold up. Hold up.

25:05.577 --> 25:08.246
- Oh, shit.
- What?

25:13.309 --> 25:15.887
- I don't know.
- Should we go back?

25:28.041 --> 25:30.849
Oh, my God! Help me!

25:32.746 --> 25:34.698
Help me!

25:36.901 --> 25:38.986
Oh, Jesus.

25:40.279 --> 25:42.776
- Should we help them?
- No, no, no, no. Nothing we can do.

25:42.876 --> 25:45.684
- We go back or we go right now.
- No, go, go, go. They're not looking.

25:45.784 --> 25:48.511
- They're not looking. Go, go.
- Go.

26:08.540 --> 26:10.609
Where they all go?

26:10.709 --> 26:13.858
Maybe we got lucky
and they all dropped off, you know,

26:13.958 --> 26:17.323
when they lost the signal
like at the train station.

26:33.549 --> 26:36.918
Tom. Tom.

26:38.312 --> 26:40.739
Always considered myself a pacifist,

26:40.839 --> 26:44.123
but I wouldn't mind
having a pistol right now.

26:44.769 --> 26:49.067
Guys. I don't think that's a good idea.

26:49.865 --> 26:53.027
I go in with my hands raised
and just say I want to talk.

26:53.127 --> 26:55.412
Maybe ring the doorbell.
What's the worst that can happen?

26:55.512 --> 26:58.966
I'm a black man with a crowbar.
I'm not walking over there.

26:59.066 --> 27:03.987
- Okay, how about that one?
- That makes all the difference in the world.

27:33.742 --> 27:36.153
Oh, my God. Oh, my.

27:56.748 --> 27:59.076
Why don't you take care of Alice?

27:59.376 --> 28:01.728
I'll get what we came for.

28:27.879 --> 28:30.448
Here, take this.

28:31.107 --> 28:32.929
Uh-uh.

28:37.213 --> 28:39.249
- What?
- Look at you.

28:39.349 --> 28:44.074
Yeah, basic training.
You never forget. Grab some ammo.

28:49.518 --> 28:51.520
How do you load these things?

28:51.620 --> 28:54.648
- You guys, there's someone out here.
- What?

28:54.748 --> 28:56.992
He's by himself.

28:57.692 --> 28:59.821
Close 'em. Close the drapes.

29:06.618 --> 29:09.169
Hey, are you okay?

29:14.951 --> 29:16.836
Hello.

29:23.919 --> 29:26.413
- Hello.
- Kid.

29:30.559 --> 29:32.610
Oh, shit.

29:38.041 --> 29:41.136
I guess they don't all travel in flock...

30:37.401 --> 30:39.152
Fuck this.

30:48.237 --> 30:50.931
Let's go. Let's go.

32:40.524 --> 32:42.875
What the hell?

33:49.518 --> 33:53.064
Well, it looks like when the sun goes
down they're programmed to pack it in.

33:53.164 --> 33:55.457
It was like they all did it together.

33:55.557 --> 33:58.443
Like it was an automated
response or something.

33:58.543 --> 34:03.524
You know what I don't get is how they
all knew exactly where we were that fast.

34:03.624 --> 34:05.993
I mean, it's not like they
were watching us or anything.

34:06.093 --> 34:08.536
Not with their own eyes anyway.

34:08.637 --> 34:13.875
Not with their own... so you're saying
when that kid saw us, they all saw us?

34:13.975 --> 34:16.255
- How else do you explain it?
- So now they're psychic?

34:16.356 --> 34:18.231
Telepathic.

34:18.331 --> 34:20.382
Like maybe...

34:20.483 --> 34:24.520
the pulse flows through them like they're
this big, organic, you know, network.

34:24.620 --> 34:26.839
Like a hive mind.

34:28.791 --> 34:30.623
Yeah.

34:31.424 --> 34:33.860
You got anything better?

35:00.431 --> 35:02.149
What makes you think they're still there?

35:02.249 --> 35:06.570
I mean, no matter what or how it went down,
don't you think they might have bailed?

35:06.670 --> 35:10.740
If they're safe,
they would have left a message.

35:18.707 --> 35:22.553
Lost most of my money
in the great collapse of '08.

35:22.653 --> 35:27.474
And I lost my emotional stability
in the great divorce of '09.

35:29.301 --> 35:32.521
You know, at the time, I thought
that was the end of the world.

35:32.621 --> 35:34.648
Whoa, what is that?

35:34.748 --> 35:37.550
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

35:38.460 --> 35:40.548
It's music.

35:50.956 --> 35:56.328
Greetings, gentlemen. Miss.
Welcome to Gaiten Academy.

35:56.828 --> 36:00.682
If you folks need a place to stay
for the night, we have plenty of rooms.

36:00.782 --> 36:03.635
The boys who didn't have
cell phones have all run off.

36:03.735 --> 36:07.298
- The ones who did have them...
- Oh, we know about that.

36:08.298 --> 36:11.966
I'm Jordan. I'm a scholarship boy.
I lived in Holloway.

36:12.066 --> 36:14.963
- Good for you, Jordan.
- Yes, sir. That's what the Head said, too.

36:15.063 --> 36:18.641
Charles Ardai. Headmaster.

36:19.151 --> 36:21.603
Quite a problem these cell phones
have caused now, isn't it?

36:23.564 --> 36:26.559
The devil's intercom
is what I used to call them.

36:26.659 --> 36:28.460
Nice. It's apt.

36:28.660 --> 36:30.437
What's with the music?

36:30.537 --> 36:32.824
Did you ever play musical chairs
as a child?

36:32.924 --> 36:35.742
- Yeah.
- Well, as long as the music doesn't stop,

36:35.842 --> 36:38.470
we've got nothing to worry about.

36:38.570 --> 36:42.107
We'll have a quick peek, then we'll go
over to Cheatham Lodge for dinner.

36:42.207 --> 36:45.386
It's not 200 yards to Tonney Field,
I promise.

36:51.175 --> 36:53.560
Holy shit.

36:57.072 --> 37:01.527
- Is the music coming from their phones?
- Don't worry, they won't wake up.

37:01.627 --> 37:04.404
How can you be so sure of that?

37:05.431 --> 37:08.604
- Observe.
- What the hell are you doing? He's...

37:09.601 --> 37:12.587
No, no, he's calm. He's calm.

37:12.687 --> 37:16.833
I could put my sword cane right through
his throat and he wouldn't try to stop me.

37:16.933 --> 37:20.136
Nor would those around him
spring to his defense.

37:20.236 --> 37:23.499
Of course, if I tried it in the daylight,
they'd tear me limb from limb.

37:23.599 --> 37:26.167
The music comes from their mouths, too.

37:26.267 --> 37:29.504
It's not hardly a whisper,
but you can hear it.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.843
- Come here.
- That's got to be your imagination.

37:33.943 --> 37:37.187
- There's no way that they're actually talking.
- Come listen.

37:43.410 --> 37:45.872
It's like they don't breathe.

37:47.180 --> 37:50.150
I can hear it. I can hear it.

37:50.250 --> 37:52.603
How is that even possible
without a transmitter?

37:52.703 --> 37:56.340
They are transmitting. It's a new skill
they seem to have picked up.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.233
And they're changing at an alarming rate.

37:59.333 --> 38:04.006
Can we please move
this conversation inside? Please.

38:08.727 --> 38:13.273
We cannot overestimate the developmental
leaps we're witnessing here.

38:13.373 --> 38:18.779
They appear to be eusocial.
Like a colony of bees or ants.

38:19.279 --> 38:21.982
They act for the good
of the group as a whole.

38:22.082 --> 38:25.151
There's no competitiveness,
no selfishness.

38:25.251 --> 38:28.814
In fact, they may be the next stage
in human evolution.

38:28.914 --> 38:33.961
Every human on planet Earth
will be part of one giant organism.

38:34.061 --> 38:36.898
No individuality. No privacy. Come on.

38:36.998 --> 38:40.026
No war. No resource depletion.

38:40.126 --> 38:43.188
- No conflict.
- No, thank you.

38:43.288 --> 38:45.847
As to what they're doing at night
as they lie there so still,

38:45.947 --> 38:49.668
open-eyed and listening to their music,

38:49.768 --> 38:51.812
we think they're rebooting.

38:51.912 --> 38:54.315
Yeah, I mean, they might as well have

38:54.415 --> 38:57.634
"software updating, please stand by"
blinking on their foreheads.

38:57.734 --> 39:03.590
- You mean they had their brains wiped?
- Yeah, I mean, what is a brain?

39:03.690 --> 39:07.619
It's just a big old hard drive.
Organic circuitry.

39:07.719 --> 39:11.873
No one knows how many bytes. Like,
giga to the power of googolplex, let's say.

39:11.973 --> 39:16.220
An infinity of bytes. If your brain
were an info strip on a hard drive,

39:16.320 --> 39:21.024
it would say something like
2% in use, 98% available.

39:21.124 --> 39:23.869
- Holmes, you astound me.
- I love cybernetics.

39:23.969 --> 39:27.314
- Ah.
- Cyberpunk fiction, too. William Gibson.

39:27.614 --> 39:30.792
- Neal Stephenson, you like him?
- Neal Stephenson is a god.

39:30.892 --> 39:35.572
- Yeah, he's pretty good.
- Right now the nights are ours.

39:35.972 --> 39:39.743
But what happens if they decide
that they need less sleep?

39:39.843 --> 39:43.772
What happens if they decide to grow
against their digital lullabies?

39:43.872 --> 39:48.427
What happens...
when they're not afraid of the dark?

39:48.527 --> 39:50.154
What are you suggesting?

39:50.254 --> 39:54.457
I think what's happening now
is more than temporary anarchy.

39:54.557 --> 39:56.951
I think it's the start of a war.

39:57.051 --> 40:00.213
It's going to be a short
but extremely nasty one.

40:00.313 --> 40:04.560
But what does one do in a war?
One kills one's enemies.

40:04.660 --> 40:07.788
Well, even with the guns we have,
it'll be slow work.

40:08.288 --> 40:11.808
We have a gasoline pump
in our little motor pool.

40:12.618 --> 40:15.812
Gasoline may serve to end their lives.

40:15.912 --> 40:19.158
Hold up. You want to napalm them?

40:19.258 --> 40:24.213
We have a sprayer truck that we use
to keep our playing fields very green.

40:27.391 --> 40:29.618
I want to wipe them out.

40:30.118 --> 40:33.422
I agree with him.
I think we should wipe them out.

40:34.022 --> 40:35.824
The ones on the soccer field.

40:35.924 --> 40:40.020
And I don't want to do it for the human race.
I want to do it for my mom.

40:40.120 --> 40:42.781
As many as we can, as fast as we can.

40:46.552 --> 40:49.006
Before it's too late.

40:57.145 --> 41:01.801
- We sure we want to do this?
- Oh, yeah, for sure. Let's go.

41:11.467 --> 41:13.528
I'm sure.

41:29.611 --> 41:31.440
Whoa.

41:34.541 --> 41:36.910
Holy cow.

41:54.653 --> 41:56.879
All right.

42:06.765 --> 42:09.809
Do you like first-person shooter games?

42:11.837 --> 42:13.654
Yeah.

42:22.781 --> 42:26.727
- Pretty freaked out, huh?
- I'm fine.

42:26.827 --> 42:29.004
How about you?

42:30.355 --> 42:32.398
Freak city.

42:43.209 --> 42:44.845
We have a problem?

42:44.945 --> 42:48.338
- No, no, no. It's great.
- Put it in a lower gear.

42:48.438 --> 42:51.969
- Yeah, it's not like I've done this before.
- Just put it in a lower gear.

42:52.069 --> 42:55.696
Yeah, we were just on somebody's
head or something.

43:06.241 --> 43:08.818
All right. They're coming back.

43:17.277 --> 43:20.472
No, you've had enough of that to be DUI.
You know that, right?

43:20.572 --> 43:22.316
Yeah.

43:22.416 --> 43:27.304
But it won't really count...
after the mass murder, you know?

43:30.231 --> 43:33.469
No one knows better than me
that you can't stop progress.

43:33.569 --> 43:38.022
But still...
you're never too old to fight it.

44:04.883 --> 44:08.994
- Holy shit.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

44:30.142 --> 44:32.889
Shit, the truck. Get down!

44:43.405 --> 44:46.041
Alice, you all right?

44:46.141 --> 44:49.219
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

44:49.319 --> 44:51.204
Shit.

44:55.633 --> 44:57.435
Ardai!

44:58.229 --> 44:59.822
Ardai!

45:00.822 --> 45:02.716
No!

45:03.116 --> 45:05.427
Help. Help him.

45:05.527 --> 45:10.744
Somebody help him. Tom. Clay.

45:11.525 --> 45:13.369
Help him.

45:14.269 --> 45:16.305
Okay.

45:16.405 --> 45:20.275
- No.
- Come on, buddy. Come on. It's okay.

45:20.375 --> 45:21.986
All right.

45:25.464 --> 45:29.117
- What is that?
- Yeah, I feel it, too.

45:30.744 --> 45:32.913
It feels like rage.

45:34.356 --> 45:36.409
We got to go right now.

45:50.973 --> 45:54.785
Do not withhold
your mercy from us, O Lord.

45:56.120 --> 45:58.589
May your love and your truth...

45:58.689 --> 46:00.799
always protect us.

46:00.899 --> 46:04.720
For troubles without number surround us.

46:05.220 --> 46:09.395
Our sins have overrun us
and we cannot see.

46:10.984 --> 46:16.147
Our sins are more
than the hairs of our head...

46:16.247 --> 46:20.218
and our hearts fail within us.

46:20.894 --> 46:23.943
Be pleased to save us, O Lord.

46:25.332 --> 46:29.770
O Lord, come quickly to help us.

46:32.623 --> 46:35.401
May those who seek to take our lives...

46:35.501 --> 46:38.145
as this life was taken...

46:39.145 --> 46:42.282
be put to shame and confusion.

46:43.642 --> 46:47.137
May those who desire ruin...

46:47.237 --> 46:50.932
be turned back in disgrace.

46:52.526 --> 46:55.871
May all those who say to us,

46:55.971 --> 46:57.973
"Aha.

46:58.657 --> 47:01.252
Aha..."

47:03.995 --> 47:07.778
be appalled by their own shame.

47:09.701 --> 47:12.125
For here lies the dead.

47:13.725 --> 47:17.247
The dust of the Earth.

49:32.978 --> 49:34.396
Nightmare?

49:35.746 --> 49:37.615
Yeah.

49:38.334 --> 49:41.820
- You, too?
- Yeah.

49:42.513 --> 49:45.741
I thought when you get older,
the nightmares go away.

49:45.841 --> 49:49.827
No, they still happen.

49:50.046 --> 49:52.673
They just grow up, too.

49:55.626 --> 49:58.929
There was this really creepy...

49:59.029 --> 50:01.140
disgusting guy in my dream.

50:01.240 --> 50:04.185
He was dirty. Yellow teeth.
He had on a red hoodie.

50:04.285 --> 50:05.477
- What?
- Long hair.

50:05.577 --> 50:08.255
Does he have a tear on his cheek?

50:08.755 --> 50:13.044
In my dream, he was poking my neck
with a knitting needle and calling me insane.

50:13.144 --> 50:17.856
- In a red hoodie?
- Pushed me in front of a speeding train.

50:23.078 --> 50:25.614
The guy in my dream...

50:25.714 --> 50:28.067
that's the character
from my graphic novel.

50:28.167 --> 50:31.453
You know, my comic book,
"The Night Traveler."

50:31.553 --> 50:34.240
He's the guy in the drawings
on your wall of your apartment?

50:34.340 --> 50:39.120
Yes. He's a... you know,
prophet of the apocalypse.

50:39.220 --> 50:41.255
So you saw all this shit coming?

50:41.355 --> 50:46.827
Hey, it was just a comic book, man.
Unless this is just all my goddamn dream.

50:46.927 --> 50:52.139
You may have had it first,
but you're definitely not the only one.

50:53.600 --> 50:56.862
It's getting dark. Let's get out of here.

50:56.962 --> 51:00.448
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I don't want to sleep no more.

52:16.132 --> 52:20.262
"Kashwak equals No-Fo."
"I heart Kashwak." What does that mean?

52:20.362 --> 52:24.575
Maybe No-Fo means no phones.

52:24.675 --> 52:27.186
Like a dead zone.
No cell phone towers, so it's safe.

52:27.286 --> 52:31.566
You can't assume that.
It's too early to think we know the rules.

52:38.488 --> 52:41.924
Open up! We're Americans.

52:48.064 --> 52:50.400
Happy hour start yet?

52:52.503 --> 52:55.106
Ooh, company.

52:55.506 --> 52:58.609
You're cute. You're cute.

52:59.809 --> 53:02.993
- You, sir, are very cute.
- Thank you.

53:03.093 --> 53:07.872
And you, my love, are to die for.

53:10.345 --> 53:11.923
No phoners come through here.

53:12.023 --> 53:14.491
Phoners don't like English food.

53:14.591 --> 53:16.593
English people don't like English food.

53:16.693 --> 53:19.989
- Hey, I do, mister.
- All right, all right.

53:20.089 --> 53:24.083
What the hell is Kashwak?
What do you guys think that is?

53:24.293 --> 53:26.978
Oh, you know Kashwak.

53:27.578 --> 53:34.045
Up in Maine. It's an unincorporated area
they call TR-90. Kashwakamak Lake.

53:34.145 --> 53:37.214
Everybody's going there.
Everybody who hasn't been pulsed.

53:37.314 --> 53:39.580
We're going. We're leaving tomorrow.

53:39.680 --> 53:44.120
- Thanks for letting us come in tonight.
- Mmm, we're happy you're here.

53:44.220 --> 53:46.965
We're really glad you're here.

53:47.216 --> 53:49.970
You think Bob Dylan's a phoner?

53:52.220 --> 53:53.803
That's a good one.

53:53.903 --> 53:58.627
There's no telephone songs on here.
That would... that would be apropos, right?

53:58.727 --> 54:03.229
Like... <i># Mr. Telephone Man #</i>

54:03.329 --> 54:06.577
<i># There's something wrong with my line #</i>

54:06.677 --> 54:09.655
<i># When I call my baby's number #</i>

54:09.755 --> 54:12.995
<i># I get a click every... # Oh, D2.</i>

54:13.095 --> 54:16.102
D... 2.

54:21.208 --> 54:24.645
That's like the devil of ego, right?

54:24.745 --> 54:27.873
The vanity of super individuality.

54:27.973 --> 54:30.917
But the other one was
this one called Arama.

54:31.017 --> 54:34.705
And he was, like, a demon of big data.

54:34.805 --> 54:38.596
Of numbers, of abstraction.
Right? You know what I'm saying?

54:38.696 --> 54:41.645
- Yeah. Yeah. Hell, yeah.
- You with me? You with me, Geoff?

54:41.745 --> 54:46.499
When I came home from Vietnam,
you know, I was lost...

54:46.599 --> 54:49.277
drifting and...

54:49.377 --> 54:51.938
somebody reached out their hand...

54:52.038 --> 54:54.166
and they saved my life.

54:54.666 --> 54:59.688
They might be dead now or even part
of the flock that's trying to pull me in.

55:00.288 --> 55:03.836
All I know is... that I didn't survive

55:03.936 --> 55:08.747
a war... and all the rest of it...

55:08.847 --> 55:12.918
just to get pulled in by this fucker

55:13.018 --> 55:15.295
or his flock.

55:15.895 --> 55:18.740
You know, the first time I saw his face,

55:18.840 --> 55:21.885
it wasn't dreams, it was in his house.

55:21.985 --> 55:23.854
On the wall. You drew him.

55:23.954 --> 55:26.966
I'm not the first guy to draw
a devil on a piece of paper.

55:27.066 --> 55:30.235
- The devil?
- Yeah.

55:30.994 --> 55:33.739
- How's it end?
- I never finished it.

55:33.839 --> 55:36.608
I mean, it's like a serial graphic novel.

55:36.708 --> 55:40.054
Didn't really end.
It was just a game and a story.

55:40.154 --> 55:41.833
- Just a game?
- Mm.

55:41.933 --> 55:47.186
Good always conquers evil.

55:47.686 --> 55:49.871
Now, I believe that.

56:22.779 --> 56:25.782
You know, and I saw you
with your son once, too.

56:25.882 --> 56:28.576
And I always wanted that.

56:31.147 --> 56:34.182
Anyway, I saw you leave
your apartment with that woman

56:34.282 --> 56:37.264
- and I just really hated that.
- Liz?

56:37.364 --> 56:40.181
Liz. Hated that.

56:40.781 --> 56:44.676
Always seemed like you were pissed at me.
I never knew what was up with you.

56:45.227 --> 56:48.065
You'd give me that death stare.

56:49.765 --> 56:53.443
Yeah. I give everyone the death stare.

56:55.587 --> 56:57.207
But...

56:57.307 --> 56:59.558
I know you love your family.

56:59.658 --> 57:04.787
I've seen you with your son
and I know that shit happens with couples...

57:04.887 --> 57:06.739
just...

57:08.909 --> 57:11.813
You're gonna find him, Clay.

57:12.963 --> 57:15.593
- You're gonna find him.
- You think?

57:17.176 --> 57:19.264
You are.

57:22.514 --> 57:26.518
We were traveling in the dark
and that was really, really dark for me.

57:26.618 --> 57:30.096
'Cause I had him. And I had her.

57:32.508 --> 57:35.819
I had some bullshit job that I hated...

57:36.219 --> 57:40.390
doing graphic design
for some stupid company.

57:40.490 --> 57:43.044
But I hated myself for not having
the balls to do what I wanted

57:43.144 --> 57:45.750
and I hated Sharon for...

57:45.850 --> 57:49.193
loving me when I hated myself
and all these warped,

57:49.293 --> 57:51.788
convoluted feelings.

57:54.613 --> 57:58.255
Sometimes I'd get home from work and
I'd change into my rock and roll T-shirt

57:58.355 --> 58:01.337
and I'd go to the bar and smoke weed
and listen to Norwegian death metal

58:01.437 --> 58:05.190
like some teenager who wanted
to blow up his high school.

58:05.290 --> 58:07.243
It was pathetic.

58:07.843 --> 58:11.572
Then one day I just split and moved out.

58:11.672 --> 58:13.958
And do you like being there?

58:14.058 --> 58:17.260
First night I was there,
I knew it was a mistake.

58:17.360 --> 58:19.629
Very first night.

58:21.798 --> 58:24.880
I called Sharon the day of the Pulse.

58:25.577 --> 58:28.839
I couldn't tell her I missed her
and that I wanted to come home.

58:28.939 --> 58:31.467
I said I want to see my son.

58:31.567 --> 58:35.196
See, I had to prove I was right
and to prove I was special, you know?

58:35.296 --> 58:39.634
I mean, probably just wanted her
to be proud of you.

58:42.319 --> 58:44.187
Well...

58:44.887 --> 58:49.659
be great if that were true.
I think I was just an asshole.

58:52.971 --> 58:56.784
Here. That's what you look like.

58:56.884 --> 58:59.853
Human beings
are the religion of the angels.

58:59.953 --> 59:04.101
And that is an angel in exile.
What do you think?

01:00:48.637 --> 01:00:50.700
Sally?

01:01:12.928 --> 01:01:15.557
Get out of my fucking bar!

01:01:26.763 --> 01:01:28.953
Get off!

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:35.664
- Get off!
- Hold on, Tom!

01:02:14.023 --> 01:02:16.075
Alice!

01:02:19.578 --> 01:02:21.580
Alice!

01:02:25.459 --> 01:02:27.577
Grab my blanket.

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:33.261
It's okay.

01:02:35.386 --> 01:02:38.931
Keep that over her. It's okay, baby.

01:02:39.231 --> 01:02:40.782
Okay.

01:02:40.882 --> 01:02:43.259
Grab underneath her.

01:02:43.959 --> 01:02:45.992
Come on.

01:02:49.157 --> 01:02:52.553
Help me bring her up. Help me
bring her up. Bring her up. Okay.

01:02:59.768 --> 01:03:02.137
Let it snow.

01:03:03.264 --> 01:03:07.275
'Cause then we can build a fort.

01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:10.554
Or a leaf.

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:15.651
Or a bird. We can build a bird.

01:03:19.005 --> 01:03:21.657
We can make a snowman.

01:03:22.501 --> 01:03:26.550
Or we could play the slinky one.

01:03:42.243 --> 01:03:44.531
I'm so sorry, buddy.

01:04:32.486 --> 01:04:35.864
You know, back in the tavern,
they attacked at night.

01:04:35.964 --> 01:04:37.774
The Head said this would happen.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:41.578
He also said they'd find new ways
of maintaining their numbers.

01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:43.622
You saw what happened back there, right?

01:04:43.722 --> 01:04:46.258
They're not just killing anymore,
they're recruiting.

01:04:46.358 --> 01:04:49.485
The pulse is coming from their mouths now.

01:04:50.085 --> 01:04:52.588
They don't need phones anymore.

01:05:21.893 --> 01:05:24.429
Well, well, well.

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:32.679
The President of the Internet
said you'd be coming this way.

01:05:32.779 --> 01:05:36.702
- And, well, here you are.
- Who are you?

01:05:36.802 --> 01:05:40.929
Why don't you put your shotgun down?
I'll be happy to tell you who I am.

01:05:42.264 --> 01:05:44.641
I'm Ray Huizenga from Groveland, Mass.

01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:47.912
This young lady here, Denise Link
from Haverhill, neighboring town.

01:05:48.112 --> 01:05:49.588
Meetcha.

01:05:49.688 --> 01:05:51.866
But our names
don't actually matter anymore.

01:05:51.966 --> 01:05:55.193
What matters...
what matters is what we do.

01:05:55.293 --> 01:05:58.922
And what we do, hmm? We kill phone freaks.

01:05:59.022 --> 01:06:02.158
Yeah, yeah, we kill them.

01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:05.886
Just like you.

01:06:06.772 --> 01:06:10.534
The second time in Nashua, we used
dynamite from a construction site shed.

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:13.429
Ray knew how to rig the dynamite
from when he worked on a road crew.

01:06:13.529 --> 01:06:16.023
That's when we started seeing
those Kashwak No-Fo signs.

01:06:16.123 --> 01:06:19.626
Kashwak. They're telling people
it's a no-phone zone, but that's a lie.

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:24.131
The area got an Indian casino built there
last year and put up a cell phone tower.

01:06:24.231 --> 01:06:27.076
The phoners are trying to draw us there
in our dreams, but it's a trap.

01:06:27.176 --> 01:06:30.037
Yeah, and the dreams
started coming after we blasted.

01:06:30.137 --> 01:06:32.814
I mean, we blasted.
That first flock, we blasted them.

01:06:32.914 --> 01:06:35.877
- Powerful dreams. Powerful dreams, like...
- We've had them.

01:06:35.977 --> 01:06:37.904
Always that phoner.
The phoner in the red hoodie.

01:06:38.004 --> 01:06:40.594
They call him the President of the Internet.
Got to be taken down.

01:06:40.694 --> 01:06:43.525
I mean down. Like, down, like...

01:06:44.225 --> 01:06:46.099
like right there.

01:06:46.199 --> 01:06:49.210
We've got to take him all the way down.
You know what I'm saying?

01:06:49.310 --> 01:06:52.532
You take him all the way down.
If you kill him... you kill him...

01:06:52.632 --> 01:06:55.521
you put him in here, the rest will...
they'll surrender. They'll quit.

01:06:55.621 --> 01:06:58.133
They'll stop. Just... poof.

01:06:59.633 --> 01:07:01.648
But it's not gonna be easy.
Know why? Know why?

01:07:01.748 --> 01:07:04.956
'Cause they get inside of people's minds.
They get inside of people's minds.

01:07:05.056 --> 01:07:07.973
- They get inside your mind, Ray?
- No, nothing in my mind.

01:07:08.073 --> 01:07:11.129
Because I stay up, hmm?
I've been awake, what, four, five, six...

01:07:11.229 --> 01:07:13.158
- six days now?
- That's great.

01:07:13.264 --> 01:07:15.923
She sleeps in there,
I'm out here guarding. I'll pace all night.

01:07:16.023 --> 01:07:19.047
I'll be all over this park.
Mary had a little lamb. She's my Mary.

01:07:19.147 --> 01:07:21.964
- Aw.
- It's not my kid. Not my kid.

01:07:22.064 --> 01:07:24.025
But she's my Mary. I'm looking after her.

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:26.360
That's great. Sounds like
you guys are in a good place.

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.279
Oh, yeah.

01:07:28.379 --> 01:07:31.073
But you know what?
We can resist as long as we stay awake.

01:07:31.173 --> 01:07:34.476
Staying awake is key.
We just stay away from the flocks.

01:07:34.876 --> 01:07:36.503
How you plan on doing that?

01:07:36.603 --> 01:07:40.332
Oh, we got ourselves a canary
in a coal mine, my friend.

01:07:40.432 --> 01:07:44.945
Hey, Denise, you want to show them and I'll
finish cooking the burgers with your son?

01:07:47.489 --> 01:07:51.485
My brother's doing more to help me out now
than he ever did when he was human.

01:07:52.135 --> 01:07:54.906
I still hate to see him like this.

01:07:55.606 --> 01:07:58.300
- He's a phoner?
- Yup. Yeah.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:02.456
He's like a little calf that broke off
from the herd and got lost.

01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:05.023
On its own, he's nothing.

01:08:05.123 --> 01:08:09.003
He just sits here and waits for them to
come back and find it or else he dies.

01:08:10.712 --> 01:08:14.433
God, he hasn't been eating.
Come on, don't do this to me.

01:08:15.633 --> 01:08:21.488
If a flock passes within a mile or so,
he starts coming to and acting up.

01:08:21.837 --> 01:08:25.169
The closer they are, the crazier he gets.
That's why we got him covered up.

01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:28.630
We don't want him showing them where
we are and bringing them down on us.

01:08:29.656 --> 01:08:31.934
Come on, don't do this to me.

01:08:35.453 --> 01:08:40.352
Sometimes I think he can
still recognize my voice.

01:08:41.426 --> 01:08:44.212
- You think they can be rehabbed?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:08:44.313 --> 01:08:46.590
Are you coming home? Are you coming home?

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:48.910
What the hell's going on?

01:08:49.010 --> 01:08:52.490
I have no idea.
He never said anything before.

01:08:55.457 --> 01:08:57.126
I just want you to come home.

01:08:57.225 --> 01:08:58.984
- That's Johnny's voice.
- No, it's not.

01:08:59.085 --> 01:09:00.703
I just want you to come home.

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:04.966
Do not listen to that shit.
You know that is not your son.

01:09:05.066 --> 01:09:07.567
- Clay, no!
- Hi, Dad.

01:09:07.667 --> 01:09:10.497
No! No! No!

01:09:10.596 --> 01:09:14.310
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
He saw us, that means they saw us.

01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:18.064
- He'll lead the rest of them to us. Come on.
- Hey, we all need to go now.

01:09:18.163 --> 01:09:21.832
- Come on.
- Everybody to the truck. Clay, come on.

01:10:11.066 --> 01:10:13.593
Why are we stopping, Ray?

01:10:54.693 --> 01:10:57.513
No, it's too late for me. It's too late
for me because they're in my head.

01:10:57.613 --> 01:10:59.999
First it was in my dreams, but now
I'm seeing stuff when I'm awake.

01:11:00.099 --> 01:11:01.546
Things that aren't there.

01:11:03.084 --> 01:11:05.462
You haven't slept for a week.
Maybe you were hallucinating.

01:11:05.562 --> 01:11:09.150
I'm hallucinating because that asshole in the
red hoodie is putting thoughts in my mind.

01:11:09.250 --> 01:11:12.919
And what the Prez wants, he's not gonna
get because you're not gonna let him.

01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:16.423
They thought it was me, but it wasn't me.
It wasn't me, it's you. He was wrong.

01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:20.452
- You're the man, my artist. You are it.
- What's that around your neck, Ray?

01:11:20.552 --> 01:11:24.247
I don't like it that you're holding on
to your kid because your kid is done.

01:11:24.347 --> 01:11:26.951
You know it in your heart
that your kid is toast. Your kid is toast.

01:11:27.051 --> 01:11:30.579
No, I don't. I don't know that.

01:11:33.724 --> 01:11:37.169
Oh! Here. Here.

01:11:38.369 --> 01:11:41.239
I'm passing the torch.
I'm passing it on to you.

01:11:43.058 --> 01:11:46.419
When the time comes, call the number
on the slip. You'll know the time.

01:11:46.519 --> 01:11:49.139
- I hope you know the time.
- What time is that, Ray?

01:11:49.239 --> 01:11:53.160
The end of the road time.
The end of the road. Mmm.

01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.899
No other options.

01:11:57.697 --> 01:12:00.184
Ray, what's that around your neck?

01:12:04.488 --> 01:12:07.724
- This, my friend, this is gonna...
- Ray.

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:11.610
This is gonna blow my mind.
You better step away, my friend.

01:12:11.710 --> 01:12:14.405
- Hold on.
- Step away, Clay!

01:13:20.681 --> 01:13:23.267
- Stay here. I'll be back.
- No, no, no, no. I'm going with you.

01:13:23.367 --> 01:13:27.246
No, no, no. Just stay with them.
I've got to do this alone.

01:13:56.383 --> 01:13:58.215
Johnny!

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:02.177
Sharon!

01:17:57.499 --> 01:17:59.867
Get off.

01:18:04.665 --> 01:18:07.160
Get off.

01:18:34.002 --> 01:18:35.962
Fucker!

01:19:13.717 --> 01:19:15.794
Is that...

01:19:17.446 --> 01:19:19.330
Yeah.

01:20:04.067 --> 01:20:05.937
So what you got there?

01:20:06.437 --> 01:20:08.205
That?

01:20:08.805 --> 01:20:11.314
Ray gave that to me.

01:20:11.414 --> 01:20:13.710
Right before he blew his head off.

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:17.452
He told me to call the number
when the time came.

01:20:17.552 --> 01:20:20.117
- When the time came?
- Uh-huh.

01:20:21.217 --> 01:20:26.539
- When's that?
- Last stop. End of the line.

01:20:27.949 --> 01:20:30.235
That's what he said?

01:20:30.793 --> 01:20:32.854
That's what he said.

01:20:32.954 --> 01:20:34.837
Hmm.

01:20:36.533 --> 01:20:39.302
Seemed like a reasonable man.

01:20:58.814 --> 01:21:02.752
- Did you know there was a bomb in here?
- No, or I wouldn't have ridden in it.

01:21:03.152 --> 01:21:06.639
So did Ray tell you
this thing was full of C-4?

01:21:07.139 --> 01:21:09.750
There's enough plastique in there
to blow up this whole fucking block.

01:21:09.850 --> 01:21:13.762
- Oh, my God.
- Here, this is Sharon's wagon.

01:21:13.862 --> 01:21:16.172
It's in the garage.

01:21:18.634 --> 01:21:20.844
I'm going to Kashwak.

01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:23.221
Are you out of your mind?

01:21:23.321 --> 01:21:26.310
- Did you not hear what Denise said?
- It's a trap. We've been through this.

01:21:26.410 --> 01:21:28.242
Maybe.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:32.214
Come on, man. If you're going there,
you're not coming out.

01:21:32.314 --> 01:21:34.500
It's a suicide mission. You're gonna die.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.203
I got to find my kid.

01:21:37.303 --> 01:21:40.151
I got to know one way or the other.

01:21:42.208 --> 01:21:44.834
Oh, Goddamn.

01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:50.858
Take this.

01:21:50.958 --> 01:21:54.779
I want you to spray paint T, J and D
for Tom, Jordan, and Denise

01:21:54.879 --> 01:21:57.323
on the side of the road
every couple miles.

01:21:57.423 --> 01:22:00.467
If you go off-road, dirt road,
put it up on a tree.

01:22:00.567 --> 01:22:04.038
Always on the left-hand side of the road
'cause that's where I'll be looking.

01:22:04.138 --> 01:22:08.492
Look, don't go. It's stupid.
You're gonna die.

01:22:09.492 --> 01:22:12.579
Hey. You remember
the story of Orpheus, buddy?

01:22:13.779 --> 01:22:16.700
Orpheus traveled to the underworld

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.236
to find his loved one,
bring them back to Earth.

01:22:23.006 --> 01:22:26.527
- You're not Orpheus.
- Take care of yourself, brother.

01:22:26.627 --> 01:22:29.972
Be right behind you. All right?

01:22:30.072 --> 01:22:32.332
Take care of Tom.

01:22:42.959 --> 01:22:46.731
You're about the best friend anybody
could ever have at the end of the world.

01:22:46.831 --> 01:22:49.900
Yeah, let's hope it's not quite the end.

01:22:52.603 --> 01:22:55.265
Good knowing you, Clay Riddell.

01:22:55.365 --> 01:22:58.241
Good to know you, Tom McCourt.

01:23:05.924 --> 01:23:08.094
Take care.

01:23:08.694 --> 01:23:10.912
You better find us.

01:23:11.813 --> 01:23:14.518
Sorry about your wife.

01:23:43.454 --> 01:23:48.580
Kashwak, please! Please help us! Please!

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.376
Take us with you!

01:27:32.699 --> 01:27:35.403
Hi, Dad. Hi, Dad.

01:27:38.489 --> 01:27:40.731
Johnny!

01:27:52.569 --> 01:27:55.035
I just want you to come home.

01:27:58.767 --> 01:28:01.936
Johnny! Johnny!

01:28:25.286 --> 01:28:27.337
Johnny!

01:31:10.292 --> 01:31:14.130
- Look, Dad, there's another.
- Mm-hmm.

01:31:20.391 --> 01:31:23.365
I'm so glad you get
to meet my friends, Johnny.

01:31:24.348 --> 01:31:28.094
- Are they gonna be my friends, too?
- You bet.

01:31:28.194 --> 01:31:30.286
What's the name of the place we're going?

01:31:30.386 --> 01:31:32.455
Canada.
