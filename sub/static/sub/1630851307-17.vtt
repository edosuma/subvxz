WEBVTT

00:05.088 --> 00:06.047
This past season
on "Below Deck Med"...

00:07.173 --> 00:08.425
My knee is so ----ed.

00:08.466 --> 00:10.301
I'm freaked out,
I can't do this.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.429
-There will be no chef?
-No chef?

00:12.470 --> 00:13.596
Welcome back.

00:13.638 --> 00:14.681
Mathew's very unpredictable.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.057
I'm going home.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.727
Just stop ----ing
walking with me.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.812
Get off my [bleep]
----ing face.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.480
But he is really a great chef.

00:22.522 --> 00:23.481
I need to come back.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.150
I am so amazed with this.

00:25.191 --> 00:27.277
-Mat's food was...
-We're gonna kidnap him.

00:27.318 --> 00:28.820
Considering everything
we've been through together,

00:28.862 --> 00:30.447
I want to end on a high note.

00:30.488 --> 00:33.324
-I'll have you on lates.
-I do wanna rotate.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.452
Third stew generally
is laundry bitch.

00:35.493 --> 00:38.288
You're a ----ing bosun.
Stand the [bleep] down.

00:38.329 --> 00:40.206
Like, who, like,
enjoys conflict?

00:40.248 --> 00:41.374
I ----ing hate it.

00:41.416 --> 00:42.792
I'm adding someone.

00:42.834 --> 00:45.462
I blame Lexi for us
bringing on a fourth stew.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.380
I don't want that
girl to be here.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.424
[retches]

00:49.466 --> 00:51.217
Somebody's gonna get hurt, and
it's gonna be because of me.

00:51.259 --> 00:53.386
It would be best
if we say goodbye.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.555
As far as
the lead deckhand goes,

00:55.597 --> 00:58.099
I will name one when
I see fit.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.809
-What up?
-David, get out on deck.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.394
You're usually the guy
I can count on

01:01.436 --> 01:03.605
to set a good
example for everyone.

01:03.646 --> 01:05.357
I've done galley
and lower pantry.

01:05.398 --> 01:06.900
Everything's set up for
the picnic.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.569
I've had my down point,
but now I want to be there,

01:09.611 --> 01:10.779
and I wanna push us through.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.619
Am I gonna find a new crew,

01:17.660 --> 01:19.454
what's the next job,
and is it gonna be such

01:19.496 --> 01:21.539
a safe and understanding
environment?

01:21.581 --> 01:23.124
I just wanna pay
for everyone but Lexi.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.459
-You're ugly as [bleep].
-Whoa.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.835
Yeah, and if this
wasn't on camera,

01:25.877 --> 01:27.379
I would have smacked your ass.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.588
It's permeated through
the entire boat.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.257
-Mm-hmm.
-I have to let you go.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.718
Considering Delaney
is still here, it's an option.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.220
It's best
it's just me and Courtney.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.554
Like, she's on the ball.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.473
I do not want the client
to feel the impact.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.183
How are you guys gonna
do it with two people?

01:40.225 --> 01:41.476
Isn't that gonna be crazy?

01:42.852 --> 01:44.437
My back!

01:44.479 --> 01:46.314
How are two of us gonna do it?
There's no way.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.441
I don't wanna be a dick, but we
need an extra person right now.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.901
How many days left?

01:52.404 --> 01:53.863
Why not spend a few
more days together?

01:53.905 --> 01:56.741
Charter number seven,
Ian Wallace and Jemele Hill.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.161
-[glass breaks]
-Ooh-hoo.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.790
We have some clothes
that might need steam.

02:03.832 --> 02:05.333
There's a lot of them, Katie.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.459
The fish and the chicken
are just a little bland.

02:06.501 --> 02:07.627
Yeah, we need some more flavor.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.505
I get insecure whenever
I get criticism.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.840
Even the smallest thing.

02:11.881 --> 02:13.550
This is, like, no.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.301
-Can I get an omelette?
-Double what she got.

02:15.343 --> 02:17.429
[bleep]
[bleep]

02:17.470 --> 02:19.305
[bleep]

02:19.347 --> 02:21.224
You've gotta be ----ing
kidding me.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.684
These eggs have put me
over the edge.

02:24.686 --> 02:25.687
...repeating in my head.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.441
Can you do me a favor?

02:37.866 --> 02:40.326
I reckon these eggs
have put me over the edge.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.911
-Okay, don't, don't, don't.
-I'm gonna cry.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.329
You stressed out this morning?

02:43.371 --> 02:44.581
No!

02:44.622 --> 02:46.332
You're fine, okay?
We got this.

02:46.374 --> 02:48.877
Mathew's stress is getting
the better of him.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.712
He got two ----ing complaints.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.756
-The fish is, like, mad bland.
-It is.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.549
I taste all kinds of beets.

02:56.426 --> 02:57.510
Sorry about that.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.512
-Okay, good?
-No.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.848
I don't know what to do.
Just stop spiraling.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.516
-This is...
-Like, smashed.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.685
Yeah, I gave them
the wrong ----ing one,

03:05.727 --> 03:07.562
because that's the mushroom one.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.898
Coco, that omelette, it's
actually the one with bacon.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.983
Sorry, this is actually
the one with bacon as well,

03:12.025 --> 03:13.401
-so the same as--
-That's him.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.903
-And it has cheese.
-Yeah.

03:14.944 --> 03:15.904
-Mm-hmm.
-Thank you.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.489
Like Christmas.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.036
I'm embarrassed that
I'm sending this to the table.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.705
These are some of
the worst egg dishes

03:25.747 --> 03:27.832
I've ever served in my career.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.502
But I just need to finish
breakfast service.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.756
-Yeah.
-We got the egg whites.

03:34.798 --> 03:35.799
Yes.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.844
Can we get a couple
toasted bagels from...

03:39.886 --> 03:41.846
-Bagels?
-Sure.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.014
Yes, to make this situation.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.974
Bagels?
I'll tell him.

03:46.601 --> 03:47.852
[bleep]

03:47.894 --> 03:49.562
Mathew, they want
some toasted bagels.

03:49.604 --> 03:50.939
Toasted bagels?

03:52.565 --> 03:54.567
So, we have some
homemade banana bread.

03:54.609 --> 03:55.985
This banana bread...

03:56.027 --> 03:57.737
is he really known
for dessert, baking,

03:57.779 --> 03:59.447
I guess, he's really good?

03:59.489 --> 04:00.490
He's generally quite good
on most things, like...

04:03.618 --> 04:04.661
I have two stews.

04:06.871 --> 04:09.290
I have demanding
----ing guests.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.419
Bagels.

04:12.460 --> 04:13.962
We all just have
to move forward,

04:14.004 --> 04:15.880
because they're not gonna
stop being demanding.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.633
You've gotta be able to drop
sh--, let it go, and carry on.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.927
This beach picnic, do you
guys still wanna do it?

04:20.969 --> 04:23.555
-Yes.
-St. Nicholas Fortress.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.598
And that's where
the interior stairs are.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.726
-Does 2:00 sound okay?
-Yeah, that's fine.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.019
Is anyone still picking, or?

04:29.060 --> 04:30.020
-I'm good.
-No, you can take it.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.563
-Good?
-Yeah.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.731
I heard they were
putting the toys out.

04:32.772 --> 04:33.815
-Yeah.
-Okay.

04:33.857 --> 04:34.816
There's some jet-skis out now.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.026
-Oh!
-Oh, yeah.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.033
Okay, we'll talk about
the beach barbeque

04:43.074 --> 04:44.909
once Malia's got
the logistics, yeah?

04:44.951 --> 04:46.786
----ing day, the worst day ever.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.623
We ready for some water sports?

04:50.665 --> 04:51.666
Can we do those?

04:51.708 --> 04:52.667
Yeah, of course you can.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.377
Let me get you some lifejackets.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.546
<i>Mzi, can you come to the</i>
<i>swim platform, please?</i>

04:56.588 --> 04:57.672
<i>Copy that, coming.</i>

04:58.882 --> 04:59.966
Come on.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.051
-Last day.
-Yeah.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.344
Literally.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.803
Everything went backwards.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.597
I know, same.
Don't... for us, as well.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.931
-Ah!
-I don't know, doesn't matter...

05:06.973 --> 05:08.058
They're fine, hey?
It's done.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.476
They're, like, good.

05:09.517 --> 05:10.769
It's not done.
They want 2:30?

05:13.813 --> 05:14.939
Maybe one more salad.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.567
I'll give you a little push.

05:17.609 --> 05:18.943
You need to head over and start.

05:18.985 --> 05:19.944
-I know.
-Okay.

05:19.986 --> 05:20.945
We're going.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.405
I'll stay back here.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.490
We're loaded up in
the tender now.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.620
-Take Courtney or...
-Take an interior?

05:28.661 --> 05:29.954
Yeah.

05:29.996 --> 05:30.955
Because I have water
sports happening, and...

05:30.997 --> 05:32.540
That's right.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.583
Someone's gonna have
to tow them, and...

05:33.625 --> 05:34.876
-Okay.
-Let's do this.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.628
<i>-Interior, interior.</i>
-Go ahead.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.838
I need either you or Courtney
to come with me

05:38.880 --> 05:40.382
and set up the beach picnic,
please.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.925
And we need to go
as soon as possible.

05:41.966 --> 05:44.094
Copy that.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.929
She's got water sports
everywhere, so...

05:45.970 --> 05:47.681
<i>Katie, are you good to go,</i>
<i>or do you want me to go?</i>

05:47.722 --> 05:49.557
<i>-Courtney, can you go?</i>
-Copy.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.560
Only one time.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.149
-Hello?
-Jeez.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.945
You're gonna stay on board
with Captain Sandy.

06:04.906 --> 06:05.865
-Are you good?
-Yep.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.158
Is all their stuff in the laund?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.159
It's down there,
but it's not in.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.577
Okay, I'll do it.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.413
Because there's so much sh--.

06:11.454 --> 06:12.455
I'm just putting on my sunnies.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.416
Okay.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.583
So, we need one more chair.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.711
See you later.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.462
Opa.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.716
Bridge, bridge, that is tender
away, me and Courtney.

06:22.757 --> 06:24.718
<i>You've got Lloyd and</i>
<i>Mzi on deck.</i>

06:25.719 --> 06:28.013
-Yeah.
-I wiped out.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.806
Sister Katie?

06:31.933 --> 06:34.019
Hello?

06:34.060 --> 06:36.438
Sister Courtney?

06:36.479 --> 06:38.898
Somebody, anybody?
Is there one?

06:39.899 --> 06:40.859
-Hello?
-Hi.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.068
Can I help you?

06:42.110 --> 06:43.570
Oh, we just want
something to drink.

06:43.611 --> 06:44.571
Something to drink?
I'll grab Katie.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.031
Yeah, thank you.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.574
You're welcome, whereabout
are you, on the...

06:47.615 --> 06:48.825
-We're just in the hot tub.
-Hot tub?

06:48.867 --> 06:50.493
All right,
I'll send her right up.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.746
-Thank you very much.
-Sorry about that.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.164
Katie, Katie, galley.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.124
The guests in the hot tub
need some drinks.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.917
Yeah.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.711
It's ----ing stupid,
because, like, a couple weeks

06:59.753 --> 07:01.463
ago I'm complaining about
needing more stews,

07:01.504 --> 07:04.090
and now I'm, like, hey,
let's just fire two stews

07:04.132 --> 07:05.258
and just keep two.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.218
Like, what is wrong with me?

07:07.260 --> 07:08.762
Hey, ladies.

07:08.803 --> 07:09.804
We thirsty, we been
thirsty for a minute.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.473
What would you like?

07:11.514 --> 07:13.683
The grapefruit-gin,
St. Germaine, and champagne.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.101
Yeah. Cool.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.728
Tight on the stern.

07:16.770 --> 07:17.812
Look at you go!

07:19.814 --> 07:20.982
Courtney's switching
to deck crew.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.859
-Deck stew?
-Yes!

07:22.901 --> 07:24.903
Good thing it's sunny.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.572
Whoa, this is so cool!

07:27.614 --> 07:29.115
This is epic.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.785
-Should we go...
-Somewhere, like, with a view.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.244
Yeah. I think here.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.040
-Vodka-tonic.
-Thank you.

07:37.082 --> 07:41.086
Vodka-grapefruit, gin,
this one's yours.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.884
What do you think
this place was?

07:47.926 --> 07:49.219
A lookout tower.

07:49.260 --> 07:52.013
Oh [bleep] me, my dressing!

07:53.682 --> 07:55.100
[bleep]
Katie, I need help.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.810
I've got lots to do.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.105
-Katie.
-Okay?

08:00.146 --> 08:02.023
-I made the one salad.
-Okay.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.566
Is that gonna be enough?

08:03.608 --> 08:04.818
Should I do, like, burgers too?

08:04.859 --> 08:07.195
Oh, honestly, do what you want.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.321
-What do you mean?
-They really don't care.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.823
I wanted to do pizzas.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.700
When Mathew's stressed,
Mathew's needy.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.869
Mathew, I love you, but I don't
have time for you right now.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.663
Should I do burgers, too?

08:16.705 --> 08:18.873
-What is wrong with you?
-I'm a mess today.

08:21.084 --> 08:25.088
-You ready?
-Yes.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.008
<i>Everybody, the guests</i>
<i>are heading in now.</i>

08:28.049 --> 08:29.718
You're gonna hate me.

08:29.759 --> 08:33.013
We have to be ready to go in,
like, 10 minutes.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.931
I'm gonna lose it.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.349
I... can you not
put them there, please?

08:36.391 --> 08:38.643
-Hello.
-Hello!

08:38.685 --> 08:40.186
-Hey, Mzi, how are you?
-How's it going?

08:40.228 --> 08:42.188
-How are you?
-Wet.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.899
I'm gonna take guests over now.
You're gonna go with the food.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.901
Hey, be careful and
take these from the bottom.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.737
It's an epic thing,

08:48.778 --> 08:51.114
and I don't think you've
gotten to do that yet, right?

08:51.156 --> 08:53.033
-It's really beautiful.
-Yeah?

08:53.074 --> 08:56.077
I'd love to reward David for
busting his ass this charter.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.872
Any frustrations that he's had,
he's left behind.

08:58.913 --> 09:03.126
That is tender away
with all guests plus two.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.211
You better drive this
boat, Malia!

09:05.253 --> 09:07.172
[laughing]

09:07.213 --> 09:09.966
This isn't the closest fortress,
but it's stunning.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.801
It's 600 years old,

09:11.843 --> 09:13.928
it's gothic style,
it's got all these dungeons.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.890
So, it's a perfect place
for a picnic...

09:16.931 --> 09:18.058
or an execution.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.226
Hell, yes.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.936
Y'all, hold on, look at this.

09:21.978 --> 09:22.937
This is pretty!

09:22.979 --> 09:23.980
This is nice.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.399
This is beautiful.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.068
-Oh!
-This is really cute.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.110
-I'll be back.
-Thanks, chick.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.862
Enjoy, you guys!

09:35.116 --> 09:37.619
That looks like
our tender returning.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.788
I don't mind the middle.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.664
Don't forget your platters.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.378
She brought
the hot sauce, too.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.046
Katie knows what we need!

09:52.967 --> 09:54.928
Interior, interior,
is that everything

09:54.969 --> 09:56.262
that needs to go for the picnic?

09:56.304 --> 09:57.764
Yep, that's everything.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.432
We gotta reset our anchor,

09:59.474 --> 10:01.101
because we're actually
drifting into shallow water.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.145
<i>How's the slide?</i>

10:04.187 --> 10:06.106
Mzi is just jumping in now
to attach the line.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.066
Courtney, I need you to come
to the swim platform.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.944
<i>We gotta hurry up.</i>

10:10.985 --> 10:12.028
Copy, Mzi is in the water.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.238
What do you need?

10:13.279 --> 10:14.322
Help me pull
the swim ladder out.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.122
We've got a slide,
all the NautiBuoys...

10:22.163 --> 10:23.957
like, we need
everyone right now,

10:23.998 --> 10:25.959
and David's off the boat
at the beach picnic.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.338
-Let's go, slide.
-Ugh!

10:30.380 --> 10:32.132
Someone needs to jump
on the WaveRunner.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.426
We need to start hauling
the anchor, do you understand?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.805
[bleep] it, Lloyd,
jump on the toys.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.390
We're detaching them
with you on them.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.058
<i>All right, we're sending</i>
<i>the jet-ski off now.</i>

10:42.100 --> 10:43.935
The rate the anchor's
dragging right now...

10:43.977 --> 10:45.979
All right, you're on your own.
Transom's coming up.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.022
This could be disastrous.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.815
Our anchor's not gonna hold us,

10:48.857 --> 10:50.233
our boat's gonna keep
drifting into shallow water.

10:54.863 --> 10:55.447
We're dragging anchor.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.824
You guys need to hurry up.

10:57.866 --> 10:58.867
All right, you're on your own.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.201
<i>Sending the jet-ski off now.</i>

11:00.243 --> 11:02.162
-I want some food!
-I want a crab cake.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.330
<i>Transom's coming up.</i>

11:04.372 --> 11:07.167
NautiBuoys are away, transom
is lifted, headed to the bow.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.171
I'm gonna run down and
grab some food for y'all.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.381
Let's go, let's go,
move faster, please.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.883
We're gonna pick up the anchor.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.555
-I want food!
-Ooh!

11:20.597 --> 11:22.432
Blue on deck.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.351
Okay, guys, if you wanna start
helping yourself.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.977
Wait, you ain't bringing
it over?

11:26.019 --> 11:28.438
She's like,
"I did bring it over...

11:28.480 --> 11:31.232
-from the boat."
-From the boat.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.318
<i>Anchor's at the waterline,</i>
<i>you are safe to maneuver.</i>

11:35.153 --> 11:36.154
<i>Nice work.</i>

11:36.196 --> 11:38.198
Anchor is home.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.283
I'm so proud of the guys
for pulling this off.

11:40.325 --> 11:43.244
Lloyd on the jet-ski,
his, like, noble steed.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.788
Mzi was composed.

11:44.829 --> 11:45.789
Good job, Mzi.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.290
To be able to handle chaos,

11:47.332 --> 11:50.293
that's the ultimate test,
and they passed it.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.170
Lloyd, are you okay?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.380
<i>Yep, copy that.</i>

11:55.256 --> 11:57.425
<i>All crew, all crew, we</i>
<i>are headed to the fortress.</i>

11:57.467 --> 11:59.469
<i>So, after the guests finish,</i>
<i>we'll meet there.</i>

11:59.511 --> 12:00.970
Copy.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.847
So, we've got
grilled vegetables,

12:02.889 --> 12:06.101
grilled chicken, pesto pasta,
Greek salad, and Caesar.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.103
So, this just has parmesan
and the Caesar dressing,

12:08.144 --> 12:09.437
so you can add what
you want to it.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.439
This is fabulous.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.614
This chicken is better
than the chicken last night.

12:19.656 --> 12:20.865
-Mm, not bad.
-Yeah.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.158
Not bad.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.537
Oh, sh--.

12:27.539 --> 12:30.083
Dragging while having
all the toys out...

12:30.125 --> 12:31.167
that was fun.

12:32.335 --> 12:33.962
-Hi.
-I'm dead.

12:34.004 --> 12:36.047
-Me, too.
-Dead.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.132
-Come and lie down with me.
-Okay.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.383
Just for a minute.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.301
All this charter
I've been trying to get

12:40.343 --> 12:42.303
out of my head and
get in a happy place.

12:42.345 --> 12:44.055
Can I do five courses?

12:44.097 --> 12:45.223
Why?

12:45.265 --> 12:47.058
I don't know.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.853
When I mess up, I question
whether I'm a good chef or not.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.230
It's not healthy, but
that's where I am right now.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.857
Ugh!

12:53.898 --> 12:54.941
How you holding up?

12:54.983 --> 12:56.443
-I'm fine.
-Yeah?

12:56.484 --> 12:58.278
I'm shocked that my eye
bags aren't as bad...

12:58.319 --> 12:59.904
There are no bags.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.072
...considering I'm
working 19-hour days.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.866
It is common in yachting.

13:02.907 --> 13:06.536
I had a charter once in Ibiza
for three weeks straight.

13:06.578 --> 13:10.206
They were up until 6:00,
7:00 in the morning.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.542
You know, we didn't do it
with two stews; I had five.

13:12.584 --> 13:15.003
But [bleep] me now, right?

13:15.045 --> 13:16.338
I'm just gonna...

13:16.379 --> 13:18.006
Tonight's gonna be hard.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.549
I reckon they're gonna
be up all night.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.928
Guys, we wanna go home,
hurry up.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.516
Yeah, that's our boat.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.185
<i>If everyone's done with the</i>
<i>stuff, I can pack it up.</i>

13:30.226 --> 13:31.519
Oh, look at the church folk.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.396
[laughing]

13:33.438 --> 13:35.231
All right, drop the anchor,
drop the anchor.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.027
Can you help me?

13:39.069 --> 13:40.487
I'm still doing laundry
and housekeeping.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.238
I did 30,000 steps yesterday
and the day before,

13:42.280 --> 13:44.032
and we haven't had a break.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.201
Just two stews, it's hard.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.535
But if it was Katie's decision,

13:47.577 --> 13:48.953
I don't wanna, like,
let her down now.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.497
I want Katie to feel supported.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.998
Like, I feel like
she's got my back all season.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.542
Twenty-four hours now.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.670
Medium stay till 11:00.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.213
Okay, thank you.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.966
Just come in and
we'll grab the dock from you.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.218
Yeah.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.054
That's crazy.

14:06.096 --> 14:07.180
Got it!

14:07.222 --> 14:08.181
Uh-oh!
You gonna get on?

14:08.223 --> 14:09.391
Just quickly.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.351
Well, how you gonna make
it, brother?

14:11.393 --> 14:12.477
David, get us
back safe, brother.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.603
-Please?
-Sorry.

14:13.645 --> 14:14.729
Can you put them there, please?

14:14.771 --> 14:15.980
I've got no space over there.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.107
What up, Mzi?

14:17.148 --> 14:18.233
-How you going?
-This is great.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.027
-Ooh sh--.
-Use your core!

14:21.069 --> 14:22.445
This about to be a stupid idea.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.990
Welcome back.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.033
Do you want me to
come straight back

14:27.075 --> 14:28.243
and get the rest of the stuff?

14:28.284 --> 14:29.536
Yeah, you can take
Mzi with you.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.246
Can I drift it for,
like, two seconds?

14:31.287 --> 14:32.247
You can drive it
all the way there, mate.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.000
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

14:35.041 --> 14:36.584
Okay, you're done,
that's enough.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.136
Just keep yourself
below seven knots.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.684
and probably be a captain
in 10 years.

14:52.726 --> 14:53.727
They were really, really happy.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.270
Really?

14:55.311 --> 14:56.980
They had, like,
seconds and thirds.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.273
I'm gonna do Asian stuff
for dinner.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.357
Five courses?

14:59.399 --> 15:00.734
-No?
-No.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.527
Some of them are going
out to the Jacuzzi.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.528
I'm gonna go have a quick
shower, is that all right?

15:03.570 --> 15:05.071
Yeah.

15:05.113 --> 15:08.158
Hey, I was gonna do
shrimp tempura to start.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.409
Okay, honestly, Mat,
I don't care.

15:09.451 --> 15:11.161
All right, we'll
talk about that...

15:11.202 --> 15:12.662
-All right, all right.
-Like, I really don't care.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.414
I've literally just stepped
foot on the boat.

15:14.456 --> 15:15.457
Like, I need a shower,
I'm covered in saltwater.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.125
Do whatever you wanna do.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.502
Okay.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.338
No, that's perfect,
mate, that's it.

15:31.181 --> 15:34.184
[bleep] I can't see sh--.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.685
There you go, you're welcome.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.314
----ing hell, Mzi!

15:39.356 --> 15:40.315
-No, it's fine.
-All right, you crack on.

15:40.357 --> 15:43.318
-Ooh!
- Yeah.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.569
Sweet.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.489
because I wanna do all of them.

15:47.530 --> 15:48.573
I don't...
honestly, I don't have time.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.159
I wanna do all of them, though.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.036
Mzi, you can stop it,
just kill the engine there.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.541
The worst day ever.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.718
Yeah.

16:15.392 --> 16:16.685
[sighs]
I can't believe it's the end.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.269
I know.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.563
Actually, it's not the end yet.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.273
Yo, Katie.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.234
Real feelings start
to come out on the last night.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.444
You're telling me not to do
as many courses

16:26.486 --> 16:28.113
and you won't tell me
which ones to cut out.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.406
I don't mean to cut you off.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.282
It's just last night,
I was still

16:31.324 --> 16:32.534
cleaning up dinner at 1:00 a.m.

16:32.575 --> 16:33.827
I know, but you need to help me.

16:33.868 --> 16:35.704
I can't even think right now.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.789
They have shrimp, and then
I was thinking a chicken,

16:37.831 --> 16:39.666
-a beef, or a salmon.
-You've done shrimp.

16:39.708 --> 16:40.667
Salmon.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.168
Should I just serve salmon,

16:42.210 --> 16:43.461
or should I do surf-and-turf
with beef?

16:43.503 --> 16:44.629
You've already
done surf-and-turf.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.381
-Yeah.
-Do salmon.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.216
I can't deal with it.
I need you to do your job.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.552
Like, I've got my own
struggles going on right now.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.679
I'm trying to be awake
for these guests.

16:52.721 --> 16:55.640
It's the last night,
just do what it is

16:55.682 --> 16:56.725
you've been doing
the whole season,

16:56.766 --> 16:58.643
and do it without asking me.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.103
Tapping out.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.148
I'm over it.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.232
Coming up...

17:04.274 --> 17:05.567
-Hello.
-I'm Malia.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.319
Luka, I'm backup chef
for you guys.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.404
Oh, okay.

17:09.446 --> 17:11.531
If something goes wrong, so.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.750
Ah, I'm so sick of this.

17:25.795 --> 17:26.838
Whew.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.428
-What up?
-What up!

17:33.470 --> 17:34.679
The hoodie and a scarf.

17:37.766 --> 17:38.725
Oh, okay. Good night.

17:38.767 --> 17:39.809
All right.

17:39.851 --> 17:40.810
-Shall we...
-Proceed?

17:40.852 --> 17:42.228
-Yeah.
-Mosey on over?

17:42.270 --> 17:43.396
Mm, hmm, hmm.

17:43.438 --> 17:44.481
[bleep] me.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.983
Yo... six-minute warning.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.235
Malia, will you be able
to help us with service?

17:49.277 --> 17:50.820
Yes.

17:50.862 --> 17:52.614
All right, here you go,
it's all yours.

17:52.655 --> 17:53.865
Sweet, thanks so much.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.658
David, can you finish
the crew mess?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.327
-Yeah.
-What's Lloyd up to?

17:57.369 --> 17:58.578
Uh... What?

17:58.620 --> 18:00.372
I think he might
be doing his CV.

18:07.504 --> 18:08.755
One more day.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.759
-Lloyd.
-Ah!

18:12.801 --> 18:14.260
As much as I love
that you're working

18:14.302 --> 18:15.929
on your CV and personal stuff...

18:15.970 --> 18:17.555
Deck comes first.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.474
Please.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.726
Katie, how confident are
you with dinner tonight?

18:21.768 --> 18:23.520
Yeah, we need fireworks tonight.

18:23.561 --> 18:24.688
Yeah, I think it'll be good.
It'll be good.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.398
We have very high expectations.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.524
You guys are special.

18:27.565 --> 18:28.858
We brought you on this trip

18:28.900 --> 18:30.485
because we look at
you guys as inspiration.

18:30.527 --> 18:31.903
We on step one, you know?

18:31.945 --> 18:33.363
-Yeah.
-Ah!

18:33.405 --> 18:35.740
The best decision
I've ever made.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.283
Oh!

18:37.325 --> 18:38.576
Can you stab me in the face?

18:42.664 --> 18:44.541
I just wanna go to bed.
That's all I care about.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.876
Come on, let's go.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.795
Shrimp tempura with
chili-garlic aioli.

18:51.423 --> 18:52.382
[phone rings]

18:52.424 --> 18:53.633
Sh--.

18:56.594 --> 18:57.971
[laughing]

18:59.806 --> 19:01.391
Hi!

19:01.433 --> 19:02.642
Malia's ringing, sorry.

19:02.684 --> 19:03.643
Her phone is ringing.

19:03.685 --> 19:04.686
Tell them we said "Hey!"

19:04.728 --> 19:05.770
Sh--

19:05.812 --> 19:09.482
Enjoy your meal.
Sorry, guys!

19:09.524 --> 19:10.942
For your first course tonight,

19:10.984 --> 19:14.654
you have shrimp tempura
with garlic-chili aioli.

19:14.696 --> 19:15.947
Yes to all of that.

19:21.453 --> 19:22.537
Mm-hmm.

19:22.579 --> 19:23.705
-Damn.
-I like it.

19:23.747 --> 19:24.956
It's nice.

19:30.962 --> 19:31.921
They like the shrimp?

19:31.963 --> 19:32.922
They love it, hey.

19:32.964 --> 19:35.425
[bleep] yeah.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.302
Shrimpin' ain't easy.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.764
Stir-fried noodles
with ginger-marinated salmon,

19:40.805 --> 19:41.765
grilled sweet potato.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.016
Yes.

19:44.809 --> 19:47.479
For your main course,
stir-fried noodles with salmon,

19:47.520 --> 19:50.940
and we have stir-fried steak
as well, for the table.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.405
Mm-hmm.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.573
That's really good.

19:58.615 --> 19:59.949
I think this was
his best dinner.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.826
That's a home run.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.453
Go on, then, both of you.

20:03.495 --> 20:04.788
-Really?
-Good job, guys.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.499
Last day.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.959
I'm sorry for being grumpy.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.419
Are they happy?

20:11.461 --> 20:12.504
They're so happy.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.673
Whew, I needed that.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.675
Hoo!

20:16.716 --> 20:18.593
All day long I couldn't focus
or think of what to cook,

20:18.635 --> 20:20.053
and I was freaked out, man.

20:20.095 --> 20:21.971
Hey, I couldn't have
done it without you.

20:22.013 --> 20:26.393
Coming out of the spiral,
that in itself was a success.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.436
[coughs]

20:28.478 --> 20:29.771
-Did I choke you?
-Yeah.

20:29.813 --> 20:31.147
<i>Lloyd, Malia.</i>

20:31.189 --> 20:32.649
I'm on the bridge,
can you meet me in here?

20:32.691 --> 20:33.983
Copy that.

20:36.861 --> 20:39.781
Hey, Coco, how are the cabins?

20:39.823 --> 20:42.492
They're done, for the last time.

20:43.618 --> 20:44.911
Yeah?

20:44.953 --> 20:46.413
Can I speak to you
for a moment in there?

20:46.454 --> 20:47.539
Yeah, of course.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.380
Really?

20:55.422 --> 20:56.506
I was wondering if
you would maybe be keen...

20:58.049 --> 20:59.884
Hell yeah, that
would be incredible.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.052
Sweet, all right,
I'll sort that out, then.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.512
Yeah, wow.

21:02.554 --> 21:03.555
I was crapping my pants
on the way up.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.682
Yeah.
Yes, Marten!

21:05.724 --> 21:09.561
From the beginning of this
charter season to how I am now,

21:09.602 --> 21:11.521
my outlook on
life and my situation

21:11.563 --> 21:13.148
is completely different.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.025
I mean, Malia's been
the best boss I've ever had.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.651
I've got a job going forward.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.570
It's been pretty
incredible, really.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.030
Thanks very much, Marten.
Honestly, though.

21:20.071 --> 21:21.114
No problem.

21:21.156 --> 21:22.532
Yeah, legend.

21:22.574 --> 21:23.950
-We done here?
-Yeah, I think so.

21:23.992 --> 21:24.951
Like, 20 minutes, y'all
wanna meet down there?

21:24.993 --> 21:25.994
Yeah.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.874
I wanna discuss Split.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.667
We'll probably be ----ed
the whole time, won't we?

21:32.709 --> 21:35.086
I reckon I may not leave
the house.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.675
This charter has been
so hard for all of us.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.719
Like, we're all ----ed.

21:42.761 --> 21:45.180
And now we're just gonna go to
a house and just be together.

21:45.221 --> 21:46.848
Like, I hope it
doesn't backfire.

21:49.059 --> 21:50.685
Ronnie!

21:50.727 --> 21:53.772
You looking like one of
them tired-ass gym coaches.

21:55.106 --> 21:56.441
Second stew is going to sleep.

21:56.483 --> 21:57.484
Yeah, girl.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.444
Bye.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.528
Katie, need some drinks.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.655
-Gotcha.
-Two, yep.

22:02.697 --> 22:04.074
See y'all tomorrow.

22:04.115 --> 22:05.450
All right, see you.

22:07.827 --> 22:11.539
Did Katie have to go to land to
get them drinks, or what's...

22:11.581 --> 22:13.750
I don't know.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.251
Sprite.

22:15.293 --> 22:17.545
Katie, you have any more
of those barbeque potato chips,

22:17.587 --> 22:18.380
and a water?

22:20.757 --> 22:22.801
It's our boat for
the next 12 hours.

22:22.842 --> 22:23.802
-So, Katie?
-Yeah?

22:23.843 --> 22:25.762
You got some gummy bears?

22:25.804 --> 22:26.763
When's it gonna end?

22:26.805 --> 22:28.098
All right, let's go!

22:28.139 --> 22:31.142
Katie, can I have a...
on the rocks?

22:31.184 --> 22:32.227
-Ooh.
-Sure.

22:33.812 --> 22:35.939
Mm-hmm.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.149
To go down to two stews
was my [bleep]-up.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.651
Let's go up.

22:39.693 --> 22:41.486
Now, like, I have
to take the punishment.

22:41.528 --> 22:42.779
About to get in this hot tub.

22:42.821 --> 22:43.988
Steam it.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.824
Oh, Jesus.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.745
How are you not in the hot tub?

22:50.787 --> 22:51.871
At least it's
not windy up here.

22:53.707 --> 22:55.583
I'm dead, man, I'm ----ing dead.

22:55.625 --> 22:56.710
Coming up...

22:56.751 --> 22:57.711
Ow!

22:57.752 --> 22:58.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

22:58.962 --> 22:59.963
-Woo!
-Yes!

23:00.005 --> 23:01.214
Ah!

23:01.256 --> 23:04.175
The lazy Susan is
being ridden hard.

23:08.680 --> 23:09.556
I'm dead, man,
I'm ----ing dead.

23:11.099 --> 23:13.727
Are we gonna do sightseeing
in Split?

23:13.768 --> 23:16.813
We should be going to a spa,
is what we should be doing.

23:16.855 --> 23:18.606
-Sleep well.
-Yeah, I will.

23:27.782 --> 23:29.117
See, if I was awake
for 20 hours,

23:29.159 --> 23:30.160
I would look like a meth addict.

23:30.201 --> 23:31.745
I feel like a meth addict.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.374
Stop.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.335
Oh, my God, I could cry
happy tears right now.

23:38.376 --> 23:40.670
Get out.
Get the [bleep] out and go.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.131
Let me just go listen.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.720
Yes!

23:48.762 --> 23:49.804
That's it, I'm done.

23:51.139 --> 23:53.058
-Thanks, David.
-Pleasure, sleep well.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.851
I don't know who I am right now.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.311
This is just mush.

23:56.353 --> 23:59.647
Like, the monkey in the brain,
the little thing.

23:59.689 --> 24:02.108
I need to sleep for,
like, three weeks straight.

24:13.703 --> 24:15.205
[snoring]

24:21.419 --> 24:24.839
Are you ready for an
egg-cellent breakfast?

24:24.881 --> 24:27.133
Well, I'm, like,
full of stress and anxiety

24:27.175 --> 24:29.260
still about yesterday's
egg-cit.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.930
Yesterday's breakfast
was a disaster.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.765
Today, I'm gonna
be finishing the season

24:33.807 --> 24:35.100
as simple as possible.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.437
Cook your own ----ing eggs.

24:39.479 --> 24:41.147
-How are you?
-I'm doing very well.

24:41.189 --> 24:42.816
One last time.

24:42.857 --> 24:43.983
What would you guys like?

24:45.026 --> 24:46.111
I'm sure I can make a good one.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.112
I'm always up for a challenge.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.279
We need to hear you say that

24:48.321 --> 24:49.698
with more confidence
for me, like...

24:49.739 --> 24:50.782
Yeah, I can make
a great Bloody Mary.

24:50.824 --> 24:51.866
There we go.

24:51.908 --> 24:53.076
-Two.
-Two?

24:53.118 --> 24:54.160
Yep.

24:56.371 --> 24:58.123
[snoring]

24:58.164 --> 25:00.083
Place the ice in a large jug...

25:00.125 --> 25:01.876
Katie's just ----ed right now.

25:01.918 --> 25:04.754
I don't want to go down there
and, like, wake her up,

25:04.796 --> 25:08.008
but oh, God, Mat
can't lose his sh-- or, like,

25:08.049 --> 25:10.135
I'm gonna hit him.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.302
I just want some bacon.

25:12.345 --> 25:13.805
Anybody else for a drink?

25:13.847 --> 25:15.056
We'll have a mimosa,
if possible.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.057
-Yeah, of course.
-Yeah.

25:16.099 --> 25:18.435
Come on, last breakfast!

25:18.476 --> 25:21.688
Bridge, bridge, we are ready
at the bow to lift the anchor.

25:21.730 --> 25:22.856
Go ahead.

25:27.318 --> 25:29.362
That's brioche French toast
with strawberry syrup.

25:31.448 --> 25:33.074
Mzi.

25:33.116 --> 25:35.118
<i>And that is anchor at home,</i>
<i>anchor at home.</i>

25:35.160 --> 25:36.828
Thank you so much.

25:39.080 --> 25:43.043
We have a brioche French toast
with a strawberry syrup.

25:44.377 --> 25:45.337
Sure, yeah.

25:45.378 --> 25:46.338
Yay, guys!

25:46.379 --> 25:47.339
-[bleep]
-Morning!

25:47.380 --> 25:49.132
Ah!

25:49.174 --> 25:50.133
It's the last one!

25:50.175 --> 25:51.801
Coco...

25:54.220 --> 25:55.347
Mm!

25:56.556 --> 25:58.099
-Yeah, let's do that.
-Yeah?

25:59.434 --> 26:00.393
Hell, no.

26:00.435 --> 26:02.395
Are you excited, Mzi?

26:02.437 --> 26:03.438
Okay, let's just not
[bleep] it up.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.106
Ah!

26:05.148 --> 26:06.900
[snoring]

26:06.941 --> 26:09.861
Captain Sandy, you have one
vessel off your starboard side.

26:09.903 --> 26:11.363
Yeah, this is it.

26:11.404 --> 26:12.989
-This is good.
-Morning, Brother Mat.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.115
Good morning, everyone,
how are you?

26:14.157 --> 26:15.200
Amazing.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.493
That's legit, right there.

26:16.534 --> 26:17.786
French toast with
strawberry syrup...

26:17.827 --> 26:19.412
nothing can go wrong.

26:19.454 --> 26:22.916
Such a cheat, but I just wanna
end this charter on a high note.

26:22.957 --> 26:25.043
Traffic is all clear
off your stern.

26:25.085 --> 26:28.171
Oh, my God, this may be the
smoothest docking we ever have.

26:28.213 --> 26:30.298
<i>I hope so,</i>
<i>let's go out with a...</i>

26:30.340 --> 26:33.093
well, not a bang.
Not... not a bang.

26:33.134 --> 26:35.220
Let's just not [bleep] up.

26:35.261 --> 26:36.888
<i>Moving to the starboard wing.</i>

26:36.930 --> 26:39.015
<i>Forty feet to the dock astern.</i>

26:42.435 --> 26:43.561
Twelve feet and closing.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.313
Sending stern lines across now.

26:45.355 --> 26:49.442
There we go, legend.

26:49.484 --> 26:51.111
Bump ahead, bump ahead.

26:51.152 --> 26:53.405
Dave, we need tension
on your spring, like, now.

26:53.446 --> 26:54.406
Okay.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.241
Pull up on your line, Mzi.

26:56.282 --> 26:58.910
Malia, we've got both port
and starboard bow lines on.

26:58.952 --> 27:00.245
Great job, guys.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.788
Malia, can I finish
with the engines?

27:01.830 --> 27:03.373
Yes, all good to shut down,
thank you.

27:03.415 --> 27:05.291
Nice work, everyone.

27:05.333 --> 27:08.211
We did it!

27:08.253 --> 27:10.422
Last docking...
it's bittersweet.

27:10.463 --> 27:11.881
[bleep] yeah, guys.

27:11.923 --> 27:14.009
Actually, I am
----ing exhausted.

27:14.050 --> 27:15.802
Like, it's just sweet.

27:15.844 --> 27:17.846
Bow, we are all made off up
here, so you guys are all good.

27:17.887 --> 27:19.264
<i>Copy that, Malia.</i>

27:19.305 --> 27:22.017
So, what's the plan
for the day, disembark?

27:22.058 --> 27:24.477
Look at you, smashing out
breakfast this morning.

27:24.519 --> 27:27.022
I'm so proud of you!

27:27.063 --> 27:28.440
Seeing her at the start of
the season just,

27:28.481 --> 27:30.942
like, being in laundry to,
like, smashing out

27:30.984 --> 27:33.278
a whole breakfast service
completely by herself,

27:33.319 --> 27:36.990
like, that's why
she deserved her two stripes.

27:38.491 --> 27:39.909
Someone give this girl
a third stripe.

27:39.951 --> 27:41.578
-Shut up.
-All right.

27:44.581 --> 27:46.875
Flats for the last time.

27:48.168 --> 27:49.461
-Thanks very much.
-Thank you.

27:49.502 --> 27:51.921
All crew, all crew,
meet me on the dock.

27:51.963 --> 27:53.173
Copy.

27:54.924 --> 27:55.884
Okay.

27:55.925 --> 27:57.135
I feel really tired today.

27:57.177 --> 27:59.554
Yeah.

27:59.596 --> 28:01.890
Thank you, sir.

28:01.931 --> 28:03.350
Thank you so much, David.

28:03.391 --> 28:04.351
Cheers, Ronnie.

28:04.392 --> 28:06.061
We had a great time.

28:06.102 --> 28:08.104
Katie, we worked you to death.
You got some grey hairs?

28:08.146 --> 28:09.314
Probably.

28:09.356 --> 28:10.940
I'll let you know, standby.

28:10.982 --> 28:12.317
We just wanna thank
all of you guys

28:12.359 --> 28:13.943
for such a memorable experience.

28:13.985 --> 28:15.445
Yes.

28:15.487 --> 28:17.322
And to kind of cap our
first year of being married

28:17.364 --> 28:18.573
on this boat with you all.

28:18.615 --> 28:20.658
It was just really phenomenal.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.119
So, we got something
for you guys.

28:23.161 --> 28:24.371
Thank you very much.

28:24.412 --> 28:25.997
-Thank you.
-Bye, guys!

28:26.039 --> 28:27.082
Bye!

28:27.123 --> 28:28.583
Nice work, everyone.

28:28.625 --> 28:30.460
Out of your whites
and in your reds,

28:30.502 --> 28:33.338
and let's meet in the salon and
count our final, very large tip.

28:33.380 --> 28:34.506
-Woo!
-Yeah!

28:34.547 --> 28:35.965
-Can we sleep yet?
-What a season.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.141
Woo!

28:45.183 --> 28:46.351
Don't break the boat!

28:46.393 --> 28:48.937
Man.

28:48.978 --> 28:51.898
All right, so, final charter,
yay, we've finished.

28:51.940 --> 28:52.899
Woohoo!

28:52.941 --> 28:57.028
Katie, I know it was hard.

28:57.070 --> 28:59.114
Hundred and ten percent.

28:59.155 --> 29:02.283
Our charter you chose
two stews, was so mild.

29:02.325 --> 29:05.412
This one was not,

29:05.453 --> 29:10.375
but you stepped up to the plate
and you worked so hard.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.544
It was incredible.

29:12.585 --> 29:14.295
Thank you.

29:14.337 --> 29:18.091
Mathew, you continue to be
the opposite of the person

29:18.133 --> 29:21.720
that boarded this vessel,
and I wanna thank you.

29:21.761 --> 29:25.557
Malia, okay...
what can I say?

29:25.598 --> 29:28.685
-I'm gonna cry.
-Oh!

29:28.727 --> 29:30.478
I'm so proud of you.

29:30.520 --> 29:33.606
Like I said from the very
first time we worked together,

29:33.648 --> 29:38.278
you're a natural-born leader,
and you invest in your team.

29:38.319 --> 29:40.697
And it's been a pleasure.

29:40.739 --> 29:43.074
Thank you, it's been a pleasure.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.036
-We did it.
-Yeah, we did.

29:46.077 --> 29:48.955
Their tip is $20,000...

29:48.997 --> 29:51.249
$1,818 a person
in U.S. dollars.

29:51.291 --> 29:52.584
Stop it, that's a good tip.

29:52.625 --> 29:55.545
And for the season,
we got $132,385.

29:55.587 --> 29:57.005
Woohoo!

29:57.047 --> 29:58.381
-That's a lot of money.
-Yeah.

29:58.423 --> 29:59.466
Cheers, guys.
Absolute pleasure.

29:59.507 --> 30:01.176
-Yes.
-Woo!

30:01.217 --> 30:02.177
Oh yeah, and tonight
we're going out to dinner

30:02.218 --> 30:03.720
with you, a little celebration.

30:03.762 --> 30:07.265
I'm gonna be inviting our
quarantine chef, Luka,

30:07.307 --> 30:09.642
to the boat for a drink
to just say thank you.

30:09.684 --> 30:11.061
Yeah, good idea.

30:11.102 --> 30:12.395
All right, see you at dinner.

30:12.437 --> 30:14.147
All right, we have
a boat to turn around.

30:17.650 --> 30:20.028
One more trash run.

30:22.322 --> 30:23.365
No.

30:23.406 --> 30:24.574
Yeah, that's us done, then.

30:24.616 --> 30:26.493
That's it, we can go chill.

30:28.370 --> 30:30.330
Do you wanna sign Malia's card?

30:30.372 --> 30:31.539
On it.

30:31.581 --> 30:33.416
Dave, can you come
to our cabin?

30:33.458 --> 30:36.044
So, this is what I've done with
my terrible computer skills.

30:44.552 --> 30:45.679
Shall I bring a
jacket, just in case?

30:45.720 --> 30:47.138
Yeah.

30:49.307 --> 30:51.309
This is what I wore
when I first got to the boat.

30:51.351 --> 30:52.477
Mm.

30:52.519 --> 30:53.478
Hi, guys.

30:53.520 --> 30:54.729
Yo.

30:54.771 --> 30:55.772
I'm coming to meet
Captain Sandy.

30:55.814 --> 30:57.482
-The chef?
-Yes, yes, yes.

30:57.524 --> 30:59.067
That's been in quarantine...
I'm Lloyd.

30:59.109 --> 31:01.069
-How are you?
-Luka, Luka, hi, how are you?

31:01.111 --> 31:03.071
-Hi.
-Hi, Luka.

31:03.113 --> 31:04.072
How are you?

31:04.114 --> 31:05.323
Good, nice to meet you, finally.

31:05.365 --> 31:06.324
Nice to meet you,
nice to meet you.

31:06.366 --> 31:07.826
Yeah.

31:07.867 --> 31:09.327
We're just gonna pop down
to the crew mess,

31:09.369 --> 31:10.495
we'll have a nice drink ready
for him.

31:10.537 --> 31:11.705
Come on in.
How was it?

31:11.746 --> 31:13.164
Oh, it was not
actually that easy.

31:13.206 --> 31:14.249
Yeah?

31:14.290 --> 31:16.167
It's four walls for four weeks.

31:16.209 --> 31:18.044
But I really appreciate it.

31:18.086 --> 31:21.673
So, let's go, I think the crew
are downstairs, waiting for you.

31:21.715 --> 31:22.674
Okay.

31:22.716 --> 31:24.092
-Hello.
-I'm Malia.

31:24.134 --> 31:25.510
-Yeah, Luka.
-Luka, nice to meet you.

31:25.552 --> 31:26.720
Nice to meet you.

31:26.761 --> 31:29.514
I was a backup chef
for you guys.

31:29.556 --> 31:30.849
Oh, okay.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.851
If something goes wrong, so...

31:32.892 --> 31:34.686
Ah!

31:34.728 --> 31:36.229
It's ----ing uncomfortable.

31:36.271 --> 31:38.440
-Would you like a drink?
-Yes, yes, yes, why not?

31:38.481 --> 31:41.776
What...
a beer or champagne, or...

31:41.818 --> 31:43.403
A little bit of beer,
maybe a beer, yeah?

31:56.708 --> 31:57.083
Okay, hello.

31:58.543 --> 31:59.794
-I'm Malia.
-Yeah, Luka.

31:59.836 --> 32:01.880
-Luka, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

32:01.921 --> 32:04.758
I was a backup chef
for you guys.

32:04.799 --> 32:06.926
-Oh, okay.
-If something goes wrong, so.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.595
Would you like a drink?

32:08.636 --> 32:09.804
Yes, yes, why not?

32:09.846 --> 32:13.141
What, a beer,
or champagne, or...

32:13.183 --> 32:14.476
A little bit of beer,
maybe a beer, yeah.

32:14.517 --> 32:15.643
A beer?

32:15.685 --> 32:16.686
So, you finished
the season, yeah?

32:16.728 --> 32:18.897
Yes, today is our last day.

32:18.938 --> 32:20.648
-Hi! I'm Katie.
-Hi.

32:20.690 --> 32:22.359
Hi, I'm Luka.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.652
Luka, blame Mathew.
He's the ----ing culprit.

32:24.694 --> 32:26.237
He only quit, like, twice,
so don't worry about it.

32:26.279 --> 32:27.447
Oh, okay.

32:27.489 --> 32:28.782
That's why I was here.

32:37.415 --> 32:38.667
Where are you from, Luka?

32:38.708 --> 32:41.586
-Croatia.
-Ah, whereabouts?

32:41.628 --> 32:43.380
Zagreb.

32:43.421 --> 32:44.381
Have you met the culprit?

32:44.422 --> 32:45.382
Yeah, I'm sorry.

32:45.423 --> 32:46.591
Yeah, yeah, we met.

32:46.633 --> 32:47.634
-Yeah, sorry.
-So, you survived.

32:47.676 --> 32:48.760
-Are you a Scorpio?
-Sorry?

32:48.802 --> 32:49.761
-No.
-Are you a Scorpio?

32:49.803 --> 32:50.804
No, no, this is a lobster.

32:50.845 --> 32:52.389
Oh, lobster, oh, I'm sorry.

32:52.430 --> 32:53.598
Lobster, lobster, and
a lot of fish stuff.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.183
Yeah?

32:55.225 --> 32:56.601
All righty, shall we go up
to the main salon?

32:56.643 --> 32:58.186
I need to get a mask,
I'll be right up.

32:58.228 --> 32:59.187
Okay.

32:59.229 --> 33:00.647
Luka, how was quarantine?

33:00.689 --> 33:03.358
Oh, dear God, just, like, going
through the recipes

33:03.400 --> 33:04.734
and working out a little bit.

33:04.776 --> 33:06.486
You know, I need to be in shape.

33:06.528 --> 33:08.321
Well, there,
that's kind of positive.

33:08.363 --> 33:10.448
-Kind of, yeah.
-Yeah.

33:10.490 --> 33:12.409
Thank you so much for being
in quarantine all this time.

33:12.450 --> 33:13.410
-Thank you.
-Yeah, nice to meet you.

33:13.451 --> 33:14.703
-Ciao, bye-bye.
-Ciao.

33:14.744 --> 33:15.787
Bye, nice to meet you, ciao.

33:15.829 --> 33:16.996
-Thank you.
-No problem.

33:17.038 --> 33:17.997
-Have a great night.
-Thank you.

33:18.039 --> 33:18.998
Yes, you too, you too.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.000
-Woo!
-Ooh!

33:20.041 --> 33:21.835
-Last night!
-Woo!

33:21.876 --> 33:25.964
-To the end of the season.
-Ah!

33:26.006 --> 33:28.633
Yes, please!

33:28.675 --> 33:31.011
Hey!

33:31.052 --> 33:32.721
I can't believe it's the end.
I actually can't.

33:32.762 --> 33:33.805
I know!

33:33.847 --> 33:35.432
Like, I'm so emotional about it.

33:35.473 --> 33:36.558
Oh, we're going to the
center of Sibenik.

33:37.892 --> 33:39.310
Yeah.

33:39.352 --> 33:40.979
I feel like I've
been here before.

33:41.021 --> 33:43.523
Yeah, guys, this is where you
fell, do you guys remember?

33:43.565 --> 33:46.651
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

33:46.693 --> 33:48.737
Lovely, lovely setting.

33:48.778 --> 33:50.363
-Hi!
-How we doing?

33:50.405 --> 33:51.656
Good, thank you.

33:51.698 --> 33:52.741
I'll have an
Aperol spritz, please.

33:52.782 --> 33:53.742
Make it two.

33:53.783 --> 33:55.452
Thank you so much.

33:55.493 --> 33:57.037
Here's to the best crew
I've ever worked with,

33:57.078 --> 33:58.038
and I'm not just saying that.

33:58.079 --> 33:59.873
-Hey!
-Yeah!

33:59.914 --> 34:03.835
This crew was the epitome of
teamwork makes the dream work,

34:03.877 --> 34:05.378
because they
have each other's back.

34:05.420 --> 34:07.380
That is such a
beautiful thing to witness.

34:07.422 --> 34:08.715
-Cheers.
-Well done.

34:10.717 --> 34:11.760
Ah, I'm gonna have the sea bass.

34:11.801 --> 34:13.386
-Pasta with truffles.
-Pasta.

34:13.428 --> 34:14.679
Sea bass, please.

34:14.721 --> 34:16.056
You guys, there's not
a ----ing chance

34:16.097 --> 34:19.726
I could have done
the season without you.

34:19.768 --> 34:21.019
If anybody's available,
that would be great.

34:21.061 --> 34:23.355
-On my way.
-Bosun/stew.

34:23.396 --> 34:24.939
Yeah, it was the whole fourth
stew thing.

34:24.981 --> 34:26.733
My mental capacity
couldn't deal with it.

34:26.775 --> 34:28.651
I cried, okay?
Everyone knows I cried about it.

34:28.693 --> 34:30.028
-Oh, yeah, you cried.
-Yeah, I cried about it.

34:30.070 --> 34:31.613
Yeah.

34:31.654 --> 34:32.781
But your guys' vibe was
so important to me,

34:32.822 --> 34:34.741
and here's to my ----ing team.

34:34.783 --> 34:36.409
Yes!

34:36.451 --> 34:38.286
Don't know if I would have
made the same decision,

34:38.328 --> 34:39.913
but I love working with her.

34:39.954 --> 34:43.583
She works her ass off,
and I completely respect that.

34:43.625 --> 34:44.918
I wanna know your highs
and lows of the season.

34:44.959 --> 34:45.919
Mm!

34:45.960 --> 34:47.504
Well, everyone knows my low.

34:47.545 --> 34:48.838
No, we don't.

34:48.880 --> 34:52.717
My low was having to cook.

34:52.759 --> 34:55.970
Think we should try to cook one
of those to see how it tastes.

34:56.012 --> 34:57.681
[bleep] it's hot.

34:57.722 --> 34:58.932
That was a low for both of us.

34:58.973 --> 35:00.975
-That was a hard one.
-Sorry.

35:01.017 --> 35:03.770
And having the client
pull me in the cabin

35:03.812 --> 35:05.397
and tell me how bad it was.

35:05.438 --> 35:06.856
Really?

35:06.898 --> 35:09.109
I know I'm a personality,
I'm a type...

35:09.150 --> 35:11.444
-You're weird as [bleep].
-Yeah, weird as [bleep].

35:11.486 --> 35:13.988
That was only one night.

35:14.030 --> 35:18.785
And my high was the dinner...

35:18.827 --> 35:20.704
watching people
that have never met each other

35:20.745 --> 35:23.331
on their first charter
pull that off.

35:27.752 --> 35:32.382
It was a team-building exercise,
if that means anything.

35:32.424 --> 35:34.509
Speaking on everyone's behalf,

35:34.551 --> 35:35.760
thank you for
everything you've done.

35:35.802 --> 35:37.012
Yes, thank you.

35:38.638 --> 35:40.432
Dave, I feel like
this whole season,

35:40.473 --> 35:43.059
you are possibly the one that's
been overlooked the most.

35:43.101 --> 35:47.856
Because you are someone that
doesn't ask for praise.

35:47.897 --> 35:49.691
Like, you are a lead deckhand.

35:49.733 --> 35:51.735
You took that
and you became that.

35:51.776 --> 35:55.113
So, officially, cheers to Dave,
our lead deckhand.

35:55.155 --> 35:57.365
Yes!

35:57.407 --> 36:01.995
So, do you wanna marry me now?

36:02.037 --> 36:03.538
I'm... I'm...
I'm kidding.

36:03.580 --> 36:05.915
Honestly, in this position,

36:05.957 --> 36:07.417
I've never felt supported
as much as I have with you.

36:07.459 --> 36:09.127
It's been a pleasure.

36:09.169 --> 36:10.670
Honestly.

36:10.712 --> 36:11.671
Are we having a shot, or what?

36:11.713 --> 36:13.381
We need a shot.

36:14.174 --> 36:15.383
Oh, I need to leave.

36:18.803 --> 36:20.680
-To Captain Sandy.
-Captain Sandy!

36:20.722 --> 36:22.640
-Cheers.
-Woo!

36:22.682 --> 36:23.933
Thank you.

36:23.975 --> 36:25.477
I'll see you back at the boat.

36:25.518 --> 36:27.062
-We'll see you later.
-We love you.

36:27.103 --> 36:28.938
And seeing as
I'm already standing up...

36:28.980 --> 36:30.440
Oh, go on, then.

36:30.482 --> 36:32.525
All right, Malia,
from the deck team.

36:32.567 --> 36:33.568
Oh, you guys!

36:33.610 --> 36:35.028
We've got a cheeky little card,

36:35.070 --> 36:36.946
but we've all written
a very personal message.

36:36.988 --> 36:40.700
We really do appreciate you.

36:40.742 --> 36:42.786
Oh, I love you guys.

36:42.827 --> 36:44.746
Oh, this is so sweet!

36:44.788 --> 36:47.582
I love these guys.
They're like all my brothers.

36:47.624 --> 36:49.501
It's very similar, and honestly,

36:49.542 --> 36:51.544
I've never had this happen
on a boat before.

36:51.586 --> 36:52.587
You legends!

36:53.880 --> 36:55.215
What is it?

36:55.256 --> 36:56.508
Put your glasses up and drink.
Who cares?

36:56.549 --> 36:57.884
[chattering]

36:57.926 --> 36:59.552
Guys, I don't have a
strong... right now.

36:59.594 --> 37:00.720
Am I gonna vom?

37:00.762 --> 37:01.930
-Yes.
-No, it's not bad.

37:01.971 --> 37:03.431
Just drink it, it tastes grand.

37:09.646 --> 37:11.731
We can make our own shots
in the crew mess, though.

37:11.773 --> 37:12.732
Done.

37:12.774 --> 37:13.817
Come, let's go.

37:15.777 --> 37:17.612
End of season.

37:17.654 --> 37:19.072
I want seven tequila shots.

37:19.114 --> 37:22.992
It's just gonna be a
----ing messy night.

37:23.034 --> 37:24.202
Someone wake up Mat.

37:25.620 --> 37:27.122
Let's go, outta the car,
come on.

37:27.163 --> 37:28.164
You're ruining my day.

37:30.667 --> 37:31.626
Oh!

37:31.668 --> 37:32.627
No!

37:32.669 --> 37:34.087
Bushes or bitches?

37:36.881 --> 37:38.800
[laughing]

37:40.844 --> 37:43.555
-Ah!
-Ah!

37:47.517 --> 37:48.935
Look at Mathew.

37:48.977 --> 37:51.521
Because it's been
working 18-hour days.

37:51.563 --> 37:52.522
Yeah.

37:52.564 --> 37:53.523
My legs!

37:53.565 --> 37:55.608
So ----ing sore!

37:55.650 --> 37:58.028
Oh sh--, man up,
season's over.

37:58.069 --> 38:00.780
Okay, you gonna be okay
getting up on the bunk, Daddy.

38:01.990 --> 38:03.908
Everybody, are you ready!

38:03.950 --> 38:05.285
Ooo-woo!

38:05.326 --> 38:08.121
-Ready?
-Oh, my God.

38:08.163 --> 38:09.748
Yes, Katie!

38:09.789 --> 38:10.957
Woo, woo!

38:10.999 --> 38:12.959
Shake it, bitch!

38:14.002 --> 38:15.628
[snoring]

38:15.670 --> 38:18.173
-Ow!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah!

38:18.214 --> 38:19.632
Woo!

38:19.674 --> 38:20.633
-Woo!
-Yes!

38:20.675 --> 38:21.926
Ah!

38:24.012 --> 38:29.059
The lazy Susan
is being ridden hard.

38:29.100 --> 38:30.769
[laughing]

38:32.145 --> 38:33.521
Are you alive?

38:33.563 --> 38:35.315
-David's down.
-Ow!

38:35.357 --> 38:36.608
Coming up...

38:49.120 --> 38:51.122
[snoring]

38:53.166 --> 38:54.584
[alarm vibrates]

38:58.213 --> 38:59.714
Wake up, sunshines!

38:59.756 --> 39:00.715
Oh!

39:00.757 --> 39:03.343
We have to get off the boat.

39:03.385 --> 39:04.719
Housekeeping.

39:04.761 --> 39:06.805
Courtney.

39:06.846 --> 39:08.139
We gotta get up and
get off the boat.

39:12.018 --> 39:14.771
The caravan to take us to Split
is gonna be here at 10:30.

39:16.773 --> 39:17.774
Split...

39:17.816 --> 39:19.317
Is the crew mess ----ed?

39:19.359 --> 39:21.903
No, a little fairy came in
and cleaned it last night.

39:25.740 --> 39:28.243
I don't know if this lazy Susan
will ever be the same.

39:28.284 --> 39:30.829
When I went to bed,
it did not look like this.

39:30.870 --> 39:32.288
Who wants their suitcase?

39:32.330 --> 39:33.873
Me!

39:33.915 --> 39:35.291
Get all your sh--
and get out.

39:38.378 --> 39:41.381
This is an awkward packing
position.

39:43.883 --> 39:45.385
-Hello!
-Hi, smiley.

39:45.427 --> 39:46.386
Hi!

39:46.428 --> 39:47.387
It's been a pleasure.

39:47.429 --> 39:48.638
Yeah, for sure.

39:53.852 --> 39:54.811
-See you!
-Bye.

39:54.853 --> 39:56.104
You want the nicest restaurant?

39:56.146 --> 39:57.981
Not the nicest restaurant,
necessarily.

39:58.023 --> 39:59.691
[laughing]

39:59.733 --> 40:01.067
Captain Sandy?

40:01.109 --> 40:02.277
Hi.

40:02.318 --> 40:03.945
Hey, I love your shirt.

40:03.987 --> 40:05.238
I just wanna thank you
for everything.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.364
Thank you for giving me
a second chance...

40:06.406 --> 40:07.866
Yeah.

40:07.907 --> 40:09.117
...and everything you've
done for us.

40:09.159 --> 40:10.160
-Thanks, Mat.
-I really appreciate it.

40:10.201 --> 40:11.828
I've been a chef my whole life.

40:11.870 --> 40:14.164
My mom was a chef,
I've worked with the best.

40:14.205 --> 40:17.292
But I've learned that I have
some growing up to do.

40:17.334 --> 40:19.461
I'm glad I didn't
freak out last night,

40:19.502 --> 40:23.006
so I feel like
that's something, right?

40:23.048 --> 40:24.466
All right, safe travels.

40:24.507 --> 40:26.009
-All right, thank you.
-Okay. Bye.

40:30.930 --> 40:31.931
Are you gonna cry?

40:31.973 --> 40:32.974
No, no, no.

40:33.016 --> 40:34.142
Oh.

40:35.435 --> 40:36.394
[knocking]

40:36.436 --> 40:37.771
-Come in.
-Hey!

40:37.812 --> 40:40.815
-Hey, yeah.
-Mm.

40:40.857 --> 40:42.442
Oh, my God, I can't
believe it's the end.

40:45.236 --> 40:47.238
So, I just wanted to
say thank you so much.

40:48.990 --> 40:50.241
Oh, well, thank you.
Give me another hug.

40:50.283 --> 40:51.242
Yeah.

40:51.284 --> 40:52.702
Sorry, thank you.

40:52.744 --> 40:54.162
I know.

40:54.204 --> 40:55.830
I did a bit of online
shopping when I was here,

40:55.872 --> 40:57.248
okay, I'm sorry.

40:57.290 --> 40:59.376
This is the heaviest bag
I've lifted all season.

40:59.417 --> 41:00.502
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much.

41:00.543 --> 41:01.711
Of course.

41:01.753 --> 41:03.380
Thank you, it was a pleasure.

41:07.258 --> 41:08.426
Let's get ----ed.

41:08.468 --> 41:09.844
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

41:09.886 --> 41:11.346
And then could I...
sorry to ask...

41:11.388 --> 41:13.181
just for a reference?

41:13.223 --> 41:14.391
Yes, of course, all of it.

41:14.432 --> 41:15.433
-Stop it.
-Okay.

41:15.475 --> 41:16.518
-Cheers.
-Bye.

41:16.559 --> 41:17.894
-Can you help me, Lloyd?
-Mm-hmm.

41:20.897 --> 41:22.857
That was back in the time
when I got breaks.

41:22.899 --> 41:25.026
-Captain Sandy?
-Hi.

41:25.068 --> 41:27.445
-Buongiorno.
-Buongiorno.

41:27.487 --> 41:31.491
I just wanted to say thank
you so much for the season.

41:31.533 --> 41:33.743
Your support has meant
the world to me.

41:33.785 --> 41:36.246
I feel like you've
definitely pushed me

41:36.287 --> 41:38.873
in areas to make me
a better leader.

41:38.915 --> 41:42.752
So, I am, like,
emotionally involved,

41:42.794 --> 41:44.004
and, like, I
find it hard to

41:44.045 --> 41:46.881
I guess find
that line sometimes.

41:46.923 --> 41:48.383
You can't always
please everyone.

41:48.425 --> 41:50.760
Like, that's definitely
something I can learn

41:50.802 --> 41:52.887
and take on
in my everyday life.

41:52.929 --> 41:55.348
-Thank you.
-I love how much you care.

41:55.390 --> 41:56.474
You're an incredible leader.

41:56.516 --> 41:58.101
Thank you.

41:58.143 --> 41:59.561
She's a boss lady,
and I'm happy I had

41:59.602 --> 42:01.146
the opportunity
to work with her.

42:01.187 --> 42:03.064
-All right, bye, Sandy.
-Bye.

42:03.106 --> 42:04.399
We should go have
drinks together.

42:04.441 --> 42:07.068
First night in Split,
mother----er.

42:07.110 --> 42:09.487
Mate, there's ----ing jockeys.

42:09.529 --> 42:10.488
I know!

42:10.530 --> 42:11.906
Be prepared.

42:11.948 --> 42:13.283
Like, this can be taken
out of context.

42:13.324 --> 42:15.243
-Hi!
-Hi!

42:15.285 --> 42:17.037
-We did it.
-Yeah.

42:17.078 --> 42:18.371
Another one.

42:18.413 --> 42:21.499
Just an incredible 180,
you are.

42:21.541 --> 42:23.501
From my first time?

42:23.543 --> 42:25.420
One-eighty.

42:25.462 --> 42:27.339
I've been inspired, and I know
this is what I wanna do now.

42:27.380 --> 42:29.007
Yeah.

42:29.049 --> 42:30.467
And it's cool that
you've done that for me.

42:30.508 --> 42:33.887
You know, I realized I wanna
be to the deckhands

42:33.928 --> 42:36.097
what Captain Sandy was to me,

42:36.139 --> 42:37.307
working with people
that are unsure

42:37.349 --> 42:39.100
of where they fit in deck.

42:39.142 --> 42:42.437
Let's figure it out and
get you to where you wanna be.

42:42.479 --> 42:44.314
-Thank you for everything.
-Please stay in touch.

42:44.356 --> 42:45.315
-Yeah, I know.
-Okay.

42:45.357 --> 42:46.441
I'll see you.

42:46.483 --> 42:47.942
Thanks for this season.

42:47.984 --> 42:48.943
Going for a hike?

42:48.985 --> 42:50.445
Yeah, I am.

42:50.487 --> 42:53.490
Dave's out, Lloyd's out,
Mzi, Mat, Courtney...

42:54.991 --> 42:56.326
And me.

42:56.368 --> 42:59.412
-Woo!
-And out.

42:59.454 --> 43:01.039
All right, let's go.

43:01.081 --> 43:02.165
Bye, Lady Michelle!

43:02.207 --> 43:03.208
Give her a little cheeky wave.

43:03.249 --> 43:04.417
Love you!

43:04.459 --> 43:07.003
Such a strange group of people.

43:07.045 --> 43:09.005
I don't know how this worked,

43:09.047 --> 43:11.591
but it worked so
----ing well.

43:11.633 --> 43:13.176
Woo!

43:17.639 --> 43:19.015
Okay.

43:19.057 --> 43:20.433
What's next?

43:22.519 --> 43:24.145
-Yay, let's get Splited!
-Let's get Splited!

43:24.187 --> 43:25.855
Melt.

43:29.693 --> 43:31.611
[laughing]

43:35.615 --> 43:37.867
I can't say.

43:37.909 --> 43:39.452
Yeah, a few things
definitely happened

43:39.494 --> 43:42.038
that will never be
spoken of again.

43:42.080 --> 43:44.332
It was like one of those
sex parties I go to.

43:49.004 --> 43:51.881
Only the people that are
there are ever gonna know.

43:51.923 --> 43:54.634
Me and Lloyd had a
----ing banging kebab.

43:54.676 --> 43:56.386
It was all very PG.

44:02.600 --> 44:04.060
Um...

44:11.401 --> 44:13.528
What happens in Split
stays in Split.
