WEBVTT

00:02.673 --> 00:04.806
Alkali Air, Flight 643,

00:04.808 --> 00:09.511
I have you on approach,
heading 1-7-5 at 4,000 feet.

00:09.513 --> 00:10.779
Curto Air

00:10.781 --> 00:15.284
272, proceed to 3,000 at 2-4-0.

00:15.286 --> 00:18.120
Essence Air 515, on final approach

00:18.122 --> 00:20.255
to runway 3-1.

00:20.257 --> 00:22.257
Affirmative, Metro.

00:22.281 --> 00:23.058
Final approach.

00:30.467 --> 00:34.269
Uh, boss, I think I just had
my whole system wink at me.

00:34.271 --> 00:36.338
What are you talking about?

00:36.340 --> 00:39.741
Everything went away,
and then it came back.

00:42.861 --> 00:44.479
Well, it's fine now.

00:46.283 --> 00:47.382
Oh, man.

00:48.449 --> 00:49.985
I saw that.

00:49.987 --> 00:51.386
Remember who was where?

00:51.388 --> 00:52.754
No. I don't think so.

00:52.756 --> 00:55.857
I had three planes incoming,
and one in final.

00:55.859 --> 00:57.526
I lost all their positions.

00:57.528 --> 00:59.594
Whatever your screen had, mine caught it.

00:59.596 --> 01:01.263
My screen just went blank.

01:01.265 --> 01:02.464
I got nothing.

01:04.367 --> 01:05.608
It's like it's playing with us.

01:05.632 --> 01:06.898
Weird.

01:07.968 --> 01:09.805
This has to be us, right?

01:09.807 --> 01:12.441
Uh, it's not like the planes
are changing course.

01:12.443 --> 01:14.043
I don't know what's going on.

01:14.067 --> 01:15.010
Reroute all planes out.

01:15.012 --> 01:16.772
Move everyone away from
their approach route.

01:16.796 --> 01:18.613
- Alkalai Air, Flight 643.
- Right now.

01:18.615 --> 01:20.515
Vector right to 1-0-0.

01:20.517 --> 01:23.485
We are rerouting you to JFK immediately.

01:23.487 --> 01:24.619
Vector right...

01:24.621 --> 01:26.021
FAA.

01:26.023 --> 01:28.423
This is Metro air traffic control tower.

01:28.425 --> 01:29.725
We've got an emergency.

01:29.727 --> 01:31.326
JB 12-7-4, we're handing you off to...

01:31.328 --> 01:34.235
Curto Air 272, vector right to...

01:34.237 --> 01:35.477
Come on, get them out of there.

01:35.501 --> 01:37.199
- Hustle.
- Uh, vector right to 2-7-0.

01:37.201 --> 01:40.035
Traffic, traffic.

01:40.037 --> 01:41.436
Descend, descend.

01:41.438 --> 01:43.372
Traffic collision
avoidance system is going off.

01:43.374 --> 01:45.054
T-CAS is reporting traffic

01:45.078 --> 01:46.441
in front of me. Who is that?

01:46.443 --> 01:47.876
Is that you, 643?

01:47.878 --> 01:49.798
- Metro, what's happening?
- Curto, listen to me.

01:49.822 --> 01:52.114
I need you to take your
own corrective action.

01:52.116 --> 01:53.682
We are blind in the tower.

01:53.684 --> 01:56.184
Repeat, we are blind in the tower.

01:56.186 --> 01:57.285
They're gonna collide.

01:57.287 --> 01:58.320
Uh, tower, roger that.

01:58.322 --> 01:59.955
We're dropping to... hundred feet.

02:01.000 --> 02:07.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:14.171 --> 02:16.309
- I've got planes.
- Zero conflict.

02:16.311 --> 02:17.773
Zero conflict.

02:17.775 --> 02:20.095
Don't know if you guys can still hear us,

02:20.119 --> 02:21.143
but we just missed 272.

02:21.145 --> 02:22.778
I think we're clear now.

02:22.780 --> 02:25.180
We can hear you, and we can see you, too.

02:25.182 --> 02:27.182
Nice work, 643.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.050
All planes, reroute

02:29.052 --> 02:33.722
to JFK, John F. Kennedy
and Echo Whiskey Romeo.

02:33.724 --> 02:35.722
Metro is closed for business.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.850
What time does this shift get over?

02:40.063 --> 02:41.895
I want to go to church.

02:51.675 --> 02:53.508
Sarah, what are you doing?

02:54.324 --> 02:57.536
I thought it'd be more fun
to tell you when you were awake.

02:57.981 --> 02:59.746
Tell me what?

03:01.039 --> 03:03.351
You did a bad thing.

03:06.190 --> 03:08.390
What are you talking about?

03:13.497 --> 03:17.055
We've got a bat in the bat cave.

03:24.942 --> 03:27.309
Kiss me, stupid.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.581
- Go, go, go!
- Clear!

03:33.517 --> 03:35.817
FBI. Let me see your hands!

03:35.819 --> 03:36.952
Don't move!

03:36.954 --> 03:38.510
You heard him, let's see your hands!

03:38.512 --> 03:39.521
Hands, now!

03:58.809 --> 04:01.141
Thanks for agreeing to meet.

04:01.545 --> 04:04.446
I guess I got the right bench.

04:04.448 --> 04:05.814
No cell phone, right?

04:05.816 --> 04:07.949
No purse.

04:09.453 --> 04:11.853
I like to meet in open places.

04:11.855 --> 04:13.388
I worry about surveillance.

04:13.390 --> 04:16.190
Much harder to pull off in open spaces.

04:16.192 --> 04:18.627
At least, before cell phones.

04:21.464 --> 04:22.996
Hear that?

04:24.668 --> 04:26.101
I'm sorry, I don't.

04:26.103 --> 04:28.251
No planes.

04:29.106 --> 04:30.972
The enormity of it.

04:31.797 --> 04:35.133
Grounding all air traffic
all over North America.

04:35.546 --> 04:38.280
We're going to finally open up
the airports tomorrow morning.

04:38.282 --> 04:40.048
You'll be hearing about that soon.

04:40.050 --> 04:41.583
Is that what this is about?

04:41.585 --> 04:43.518
Is that why you asked to meet with me?

04:43.520 --> 04:44.871
Mm-hmm.

04:45.645 --> 04:47.187
We caught the guy.

04:47.758 --> 04:49.940
You'll be hearing about that, too.

04:50.294 --> 04:51.942
Computer hacker out of Brooklyn.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.829
What can I do for you?

04:54.831 --> 04:56.398
Flanigan.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.766
William Flanigan.

04:57.768 --> 04:59.467
Assistant United States Attorney.

04:59.469 --> 05:00.669
Nice to meet you.

05:00.671 --> 05:01.671
I think.

05:02.285 --> 05:03.705
We need to convict this fellow.

05:03.707 --> 05:04.839
In an open court.

05:04.841 --> 05:07.275
In full view of the people and the press.

05:07.277 --> 05:08.843
We have to get a guilty verdict,

05:08.845 --> 05:11.146
but the subject matter
is pretty technical.

05:11.148 --> 05:14.089
Computers, servers, lines of code.

05:14.785 --> 05:18.086
I need the help of someone who
understands how to pick jurors.

05:18.088 --> 05:20.121
And how to talk to them.

05:20.123 --> 05:22.357
I need your company's help, Ms. Morgan.

05:22.359 --> 05:23.825
It's not my company.

05:23.827 --> 05:25.727
It belongs to Dr. Jason Bull.

05:25.729 --> 05:28.296
I know that. But Dr. Bull didn't
work for Homeland Security,

05:28.298 --> 05:29.464
you did.

05:29.466 --> 05:33.335
I was hoping I could convince
you to convince him.

05:39.406 --> 05:40.775
Yes.

05:48.819 --> 05:50.685
Come on, baby.

05:50.687 --> 05:51.853
Do it for me.

05:51.855 --> 05:53.545
Pop it, baby. Come on.

05:54.257 --> 05:55.547
Yeah.

05:56.893 --> 06:00.161
Okay. Everyone, drop what you're doing.

06:00.163 --> 06:03.597
Big guy has called a
company-wide meeting, now.

06:04.468 --> 06:05.834
Come on, man.

06:06.391 --> 06:07.902
I'm dying here.

06:08.477 --> 06:10.305
Chunk. Come on.

06:10.307 --> 06:12.073
You're killing me. I'm so close, man.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.691
I can feel it.

06:15.545 --> 06:17.068
I can smell it.

06:19.182 --> 06:20.448
Come on.

06:20.450 --> 06:22.584
Chunk-a-licious, let's do it.

06:28.492 --> 06:29.998
I hate you.

06:36.166 --> 06:37.565
Sorry, Danny.

06:37.567 --> 06:39.034
I need you to surrender your phone.

06:39.036 --> 06:40.796
You'll get it back
at the end of the workday.

06:40.820 --> 06:41.770
Says who?

06:41.772 --> 06:42.637
Dr. Bull.

06:45.263 --> 06:46.743
Well, just be careful with this thing.

06:46.745 --> 06:48.178
My whole life is on this phone.

06:48.180 --> 06:49.778
Hey, mine's in there, too.

06:51.515 --> 06:52.781
<i>Okay.</i>

06:53.855 --> 06:56.651
I'm guessing most of you heard or read

06:56.653 --> 06:58.353
or saw on the news this morning,

06:58.355 --> 07:00.475
the government has captured
the man behind the hacking

07:00.499 --> 07:01.956
of our air traffic control system,

07:01.958 --> 07:05.226
which resulted in the near miss
of two commercial airliners

07:05.228 --> 07:06.895
earlier this week.

07:06.897 --> 07:08.196
What you didn't see

07:08.198 --> 07:10.999
was my presence
at his arraignment this morning.

07:11.790 --> 07:13.535
The United States government has asked me

07:13.537 --> 07:16.538
and, by extension, you,

07:16.540 --> 07:18.506
to lend them our unique talents

07:18.508 --> 07:21.176
to help make sure
they can put this man away.

07:21.178 --> 07:23.745
Now, not everyone will be involved.

07:23.747 --> 07:28.516
But if you are, trust me:
the FBI will vet you.

07:28.932 --> 07:30.685
Thoroughly.

07:30.687 --> 07:33.288
And whether you are involved or
not, you are expressly forbidden

07:33.290 --> 07:36.291
from texting, e-mailing,
tweeting or discussing

07:36.293 --> 07:38.226
our involvement with anyone.

07:38.228 --> 07:41.096
Not your parents, not the
press, not your priest.

07:41.098 --> 07:43.298
And now, to fill you in
on some other security concerns,

07:43.322 --> 07:44.766
our very own Marissa Morgan.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.434
Now, as Dr. Bull just mentioned,

07:46.436 --> 07:48.903
if you do end up
being a part of this case,

07:48.905 --> 07:51.172
you are not to communicate

07:51.174 --> 07:54.142
via e-mail, text or any electronic media.

07:54.624 --> 07:56.377
Not even with each other.

07:56.379 --> 07:58.379
Remember, this was an act

07:58.381 --> 08:00.048
perpetrated by people
whose business it is

08:00.050 --> 08:01.349
to find you.

08:01.351 --> 08:04.219
And follow you and read
whatever digital breadcrumbs

08:04.221 --> 08:05.820
you choose to leave for them.

08:05.822 --> 08:08.256
So we are not going to leave any.

08:08.258 --> 08:09.657
We're writing on pads.

08:09.659 --> 08:13.428
Exchanging ideas
via interoffice memos, and...

08:13.430 --> 08:15.497
talking to each other.

08:15.499 --> 08:18.299
We have no idea

08:18.301 --> 08:21.636
if this fellow is working alone
or as part of a group,

08:21.638 --> 08:24.072
and until we are sure that
there is no one else out there

08:24.074 --> 08:28.950
continuing his dirty work,
everything is old-school.

08:32.048 --> 08:34.115
No, Mom, I'm not going to tell my boss

08:34.116 --> 08:35.616
that my mother requires me

08:35.619 --> 08:38.208
to have my phone on me at all times.

08:38.755 --> 08:41.121
All right, I'm hanging up now.

08:41.124 --> 08:42.289
I love you.

08:42.292 --> 08:43.424
Bye.

08:43.426 --> 08:45.460
Holy crap, it's Cable McCrory,

08:45.462 --> 08:47.495
the worst college roommate ever!

08:47.497 --> 08:48.630
Oh, my God.

08:48.632 --> 08:50.365
Oh!

08:50.367 --> 08:53.668
Oh, you owe me so many cigarettes.

08:53.670 --> 08:55.370
So many drinks.

08:55.372 --> 08:57.105
Wow.

08:57.107 --> 08:59.140
In a city of eight million people.

08:59.142 --> 09:00.675
What are the odds?

09:02.646 --> 09:10.668
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

09:14.776 --> 09:16.146
Malcolm Swift. I'm sure

09:16.148 --> 09:18.216
you've read about him by now. 31.

09:18.241 --> 09:19.907
He's a systems security analyst.

09:19.909 --> 09:21.909
For those of you
who don't speak computer,

09:21.911 --> 09:23.744
he's the guy huge corporations hire

09:23.746 --> 09:26.347
to try and hack their company's
computer networks.

09:26.925 --> 09:28.382
Find their vulnerabilities, and then

09:28.384 --> 09:30.251
design ways to plug them up.

09:30.253 --> 09:31.934
I take it he's pretty good
at what he does?

09:31.958 --> 09:32.686
The best.

09:32.688 --> 09:35.629
Some people think of him
as sort of a cyber prodigy.

09:35.935 --> 09:38.062
One of the reasons we're so
certain that he's our guy

09:38.064 --> 09:40.531
is that there are only three
or four people in the world

09:40.533 --> 09:42.500
who could pull off what he did.

09:42.502 --> 09:43.701
And what is it,

09:43.703 --> 09:45.937
exactly, that he pulled off?

09:45.939 --> 09:47.205
Well, what do you mean?

09:47.207 --> 09:48.773
I think that's pretty clear.

09:48.775 --> 09:50.942
He hacked into
our air traffic control system,

09:50.944 --> 09:52.877
and nearly brought down two jetliners.

09:52.879 --> 09:54.879
Yeah. I know.
I've been thinking about that.

09:54.881 --> 09:56.914
I read all the interviews with
the air traffic controllers.

09:56.916 --> 09:58.216
It sounded like he had everything

09:58.218 --> 09:59.751
right where he wanted it.

09:59.753 --> 10:02.453
Those two planes
were seconds from colliding,

10:02.455 --> 10:03.955
and then... They didn't.

10:03.957 --> 10:04.989
What's your point?

10:04.991 --> 10:06.557
It's always helpful to have motive.

10:06.559 --> 10:09.527
And it's hard to find motive
in an act that seems

10:09.529 --> 10:13.097
like it could have happened,
but then, just didn't.

10:13.555 --> 10:15.355
<i>Let me give you a little background.</i>

10:15.379 --> 10:17.235
Malcolm was born in the Soviet Union.

10:17.237 --> 10:20.271
Father was a soldier in the Soviet Army.

10:20.273 --> 10:22.507
When communism fell, Malcolm's father

10:22.509 --> 10:24.609
moved the family to the United States.

10:24.611 --> 10:26.647
He traded secrets to our government

10:27.054 --> 10:29.847
in exchange for asylum and a new life.

10:29.849 --> 10:32.550
He had a short stint with the CIA,

10:32.552 --> 10:33.885
but it wasn't a good fit.

10:33.887 --> 10:36.654
Language and cultural barriers.

10:36.656 --> 10:40.158
Family eventually fell
on hard times, hung himself.

10:40.160 --> 10:41.559
When Malcolm was ten.

10:41.561 --> 10:45.930
Well, that sounds tragic,
but it's not motive.

10:45.932 --> 10:48.466
I mean, we can speculate that
he's bitter towards the U.S.

10:48.468 --> 10:51.803
because of the way his father
was treated by the CIA,

10:51.805 --> 10:55.673
but without evidence of that,
it's just a theory.

10:56.264 --> 10:57.275
I agree.

10:57.277 --> 10:58.376
Does he have an alibi?

10:58.378 --> 10:59.944
Claims he was working

10:59.946 --> 11:01.215
at the time of the hack.

11:01.217 --> 11:02.580
On-site, for a finance company,

11:02.582 --> 11:04.282
testing their firewalls.

11:04.284 --> 11:06.884
He was working with their
in-house systems analyst.

11:06.886 --> 11:08.920
Didn't even have his laptop with him.

11:08.922 --> 11:11.823
He's claiming someone's framing him.

11:11.825 --> 11:14.158
Routing their signal though his IP.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.027
Well, could he be telling the truth?

11:16.029 --> 11:17.261
Extremely unlikely.

11:17.263 --> 11:18.496
I'm not sure I agree.

11:18.498 --> 11:20.965
It's definitely possible to reroute

11:20.967 --> 11:22.366
and encrypt a computer address.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.471
I'm sorry, it just is.

11:27.473 --> 11:29.340
You just got to know how to do it.

11:29.342 --> 11:30.575
She's my cyber prodigy.

11:31.299 --> 11:32.677
If you had access

11:32.679 --> 11:34.078
to the hacked server,

11:34.080 --> 11:35.513
is there any way you could ascertain

11:35.515 --> 11:39.083
whether Malcolm actually was
the originator of the hack?

11:39.085 --> 11:41.152
It's impossible to know without looking.

11:41.154 --> 11:42.153
Fair enough.

11:42.155 --> 11:43.721
Can we get her access to the server?

11:44.062 --> 11:45.590
Mm-mm.

11:46.726 --> 11:48.326
You looking for your cell phone?

11:50.864 --> 11:53.531
Let me walk back to my office,
see if I can't put that

11:53.533 --> 11:55.399
into motion, hmm?

11:57.837 --> 11:59.403
Knock, knock.

11:59.405 --> 12:01.072
Still haven't heard anything.

12:01.074 --> 12:02.406
My guess is you'll not be

12:02.408 --> 12:03.774
probing any servers till tomorrow.

12:03.776 --> 12:05.576
That's not what I wanted
to talk to you about.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.777
Though it's not unrelated.

12:06.779 --> 12:08.546
If it's about the quality
of the catering at lunch today,

12:08.548 --> 12:09.881
- I don't want to hear it.
- Last night,

12:09.883 --> 12:12.416
when I was leaving work, I ran
into an old college roommate

12:12.418 --> 12:14.785
of mine that I haven't seen
in, like, seven years.

12:14.787 --> 12:16.053
Amazing girl.

12:16.055 --> 12:17.421
Also a computer expert.

12:17.423 --> 12:19.472
I thought it was totally by chance.

12:20.026 --> 12:22.927
So, we got some tea and she told me

12:22.929 --> 12:25.596
that she has been going
out with Malcolm Swift

12:25.598 --> 12:27.798
for the last couple of months.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.901
- Hmm.
- I don't know how she found me.

12:29.903 --> 12:31.969
But I shut the conversation down
immediately.

12:31.971 --> 12:33.104
Didn't tell her why.

12:33.106 --> 12:34.906
Just told her I couldn't speak to her.

12:36.739 --> 12:39.777
My guess is, Swift's attorney
saw me at the arraignment.

12:39.779 --> 12:41.078
Did a little digging.

12:41.080 --> 12:43.247
Realized you work for me
and sent Malcolm's girlfriend

12:43.249 --> 12:44.949
to see if she could get some intel.

12:44.951 --> 12:46.584
You're not concerned?

12:48.788 --> 12:50.988
Not if that's the whole story.

12:50.990 --> 12:52.857
I'll bring Flanigan up to speed.

12:52.859 --> 12:55.893
If he has an issue,
I'm sure he'll tell me, but...

12:55.895 --> 12:59.563
You do understand,
you can't see her anymore.

12:59.565 --> 13:01.399
You can't communicate with her anymore.

13:01.401 --> 13:03.267
Of course.

13:04.370 --> 13:07.471
You know,

13:07.473 --> 13:09.206
I'm counting on you.

13:09.208 --> 13:11.075
I won't let you down.

13:12.011 --> 13:13.544
Dominguez.

13:14.277 --> 13:17.081
Don't turn it on till
you've left the building.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.582
McCrory.

13:18.584 --> 13:20.217
Thanks.

13:31.835 --> 13:34.641
_

14:06.432 --> 14:08.499
Don't walk away.

14:08.501 --> 14:10.001
I need to talk to you.

14:10.003 --> 14:11.535
I don't think you understand.

14:11.537 --> 14:12.636
Or maybe you do.

14:12.638 --> 14:14.671
I can't talk to you.

14:15.308 --> 14:17.799
Cable, I'm having his baby.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.014
<i>You've never met him, but he's this</i>

14:23.016 --> 14:24.806
amazing man.

14:25.218 --> 14:27.018
There's no way he's responsible

14:27.020 --> 14:28.935
for what the government
is accusing him of.

14:30.311 --> 14:32.423
Something is going on.

14:32.425 --> 14:34.592
Something bigger than him.

14:34.594 --> 14:36.260
Bigger than us and...

14:36.262 --> 14:38.863
they've decided to make Malcolm
the scapegoat.

14:38.865 --> 14:40.097
I don't know, Sarah.

14:40.099 --> 14:41.332
These guys are pretty smart

14:41.334 --> 14:42.900
and they seem really certain.

14:42.902 --> 14:45.036
Of course they do. That's their job.

14:45.038 --> 14:46.871
Yeah, well, it's my job, too.

14:46.873 --> 14:48.205
I-I really need to go.

14:48.207 --> 14:49.907
Have you looked at the server?

14:49.909 --> 14:51.208
What?

14:51.210 --> 14:53.411
It's okay. Don't answer.

14:53.413 --> 14:54.678
Just listen.

14:59.185 --> 15:01.685
You know what the government's
play is gonna be.

15:01.687 --> 15:03.320
They're gonna try and tell a jury

15:03.322 --> 15:05.856
that if you follow the hack,
follow the code,

15:05.858 --> 15:07.725
through all the various countries

15:07.727 --> 15:09.360
and the foreign proxies

15:09.362 --> 15:11.002
and the different IPs
that people generate

15:11.026 --> 15:12.029
to hide their hacks...

15:12.031 --> 15:14.932
that the trail leads
right back to Malcolm.

15:14.934 --> 15:17.535
That the cyber signature
on the server matches his.

15:17.537 --> 15:19.070
I'm sure you're right.

15:19.072 --> 15:21.639
And I'm sure someone is making it

15:21.641 --> 15:23.007
look like Malcolm did this.

15:23.009 --> 15:26.077
But if they actually have
his cyber signature, then...

15:26.079 --> 15:28.212
Sorry. I-I don't believe they do.

15:28.214 --> 15:30.681
How can they?
I mean, maybe they came close.

15:30.683 --> 15:32.783
The guy attacks systems for a living.

15:32.785 --> 15:34.919
It wouldn't be that hard for someone

15:34.921 --> 15:37.354
to do a bunch of research
and try and duplicate it.

15:37.356 --> 15:39.490
But you know as well as I do,

15:39.492 --> 15:42.693
it's impossible to duplicate it exactly.

15:42.695 --> 15:46.163
I mean, we're talking thousands
upon thousands of variables.

15:46.165 --> 15:48.599
I <i> so</i> shouldn't be having
this conversation right now.

15:48.601 --> 15:51.602
Cable, there has to be a difference.

15:51.604 --> 15:54.138
Even if it's only off by one indicator.

15:59.078 --> 16:00.778
This is his real one.

16:00.780 --> 16:02.880
His cyber signature.

16:03.529 --> 16:05.449
Whoever has access to that server,

16:05.451 --> 16:06.817
if you could just...

16:06.819 --> 16:09.353
just get them to take a second look.

16:09.355 --> 16:10.955
Compare it to this, to the real thing,

16:10.957 --> 16:13.190
- they'll see...
- Sarah, that's never going to happen.

16:13.192 --> 16:14.692
It has to happen.

16:14.694 --> 16:16.193
They have the wrong man.

16:16.584 --> 16:18.529
They have the father of my baby.

16:18.531 --> 16:20.698
My baby is gonna grow up without a daddy.

16:22.869 --> 16:24.635
Give this to his attorney.

16:24.637 --> 16:26.470
I tried.

16:26.472 --> 16:28.506
They don't understand.

16:28.508 --> 16:30.074
They don't think a jury is gonna get it.

16:30.076 --> 16:31.976
That's why it has to come from your side.

16:31.978 --> 16:33.310
The government has to see

16:33.312 --> 16:34.752
that they've accused the wrong person

16:34.776 --> 16:37.467
and they have to drop the case
and free him.

16:39.952 --> 16:42.235
Malcolm's falling apart.

16:43.489 --> 16:46.123
They put him with the general population.

16:46.125 --> 16:49.160
Someone's gonna kill him.

16:59.505 --> 17:00.971
Don't contact me.

17:00.973 --> 17:03.974
I'll contact you or someone
will contact you and...

17:03.976 --> 17:05.175
we were never here.

17:13.106 --> 17:15.707
Mm, meant to tell you two.

17:16.775 --> 17:21.377
Desmond Tatlock from MIT is
taking the train in tomorrow.

17:21.380 --> 17:23.313
We'll prep him and get
him ready for the stand

17:23.315 --> 17:24.714
whenever you give word.

17:24.715 --> 17:26.249
Hmm.

17:26.251 --> 17:27.717
So that's six computer experts,

17:27.719 --> 17:28.985
the air traffic controllers,

17:28.987 --> 17:30.893
the pilots of the planes involved.

17:31.533 --> 17:32.989
Got a great parade of witnesses.

17:34.693 --> 17:36.393
So why am I still nervous?

17:36.395 --> 17:38.958
'Cause we still don't know
why he really did it.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.931
And as foolproof as voir dire seems...

17:41.933 --> 17:43.653
"Hey, want to vote
on the guilt or innocence

17:43.677 --> 17:45.001
of Osama bin Laden?"

17:45.003 --> 17:48.171
All you need is one "no" vote
and you've got a mistrial.

17:48.173 --> 17:51.374
And this moment of certainty,
this moment where

17:51.376 --> 17:54.044
everyone in the world is on your side,

17:54.682 --> 17:55.854
will have passed you by.

17:55.856 --> 17:58.090
So what do we do, Dr. Jury?

17:59.593 --> 18:01.727
Got to identify and avoid...

18:01.729 --> 18:03.962
contrarians.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.157
<i>The problem with contrarians is,</i>

18:06.181 --> 18:07.734
<i>they suffer from a cognitive bias</i>

18:07.736 --> 18:09.134
<i>known as reactance.</i>

18:09.136 --> 18:11.055
<i>Reactance occurs when a person feels</i>

18:11.057 --> 18:14.273
<i>that someone is trying
to limit their choices.</i>

18:14.275 --> 18:16.829
<i>And that reactance causes
the person to adopt a view</i>

18:16.831 --> 18:20.078
<i>that's contrary to what the group thinks.</i>

18:20.080 --> 18:22.347
Do me a favor and raise
your hand if you believe

18:22.349 --> 18:25.117
that on September 11, 2001,

18:25.119 --> 18:28.587
19 militants associated
with al-Qaeda hijacked

18:28.589 --> 18:31.590
four airplanes and carried out
suicide attacks

18:31.592 --> 18:33.659
against targets in the United States.

18:38.106 --> 18:40.386
Your Honor, the prosecution
would like to thank and excuse

18:40.388 --> 18:42.701
jurors six and eight.

18:42.703 --> 18:44.503
It's not a value judgment.

18:44.505 --> 18:47.773
Contrarians often make
great contributions to society.

18:47.775 --> 18:51.977
Martin Luther King, Gandhi,
my all-time favorite Steve Jobs,

18:51.979 --> 18:53.478
all were thought to be contrarians

18:53.480 --> 18:55.781
by the societies in which they lived.

18:55.783 --> 18:59.284
They questioned the status quo,
which can be a great thing.

18:59.286 --> 19:02.054
Unfortunately, just not
a very helpful trait

19:02.056 --> 19:05.824
when you're trying to convict
a man of attempted mass murder.

19:06.712 --> 19:08.927
How many of you have children?

19:09.757 --> 19:12.130
And how many of you have had
your children vaccinated

19:12.132 --> 19:14.470
as per New York State law?

19:15.805 --> 19:17.645
Your Honor, the prosecution
would like to thank

19:17.669 --> 19:19.736
and excuse juror 22.

19:20.328 --> 19:22.608
It would also be helpful to get
a sense of how susceptible

19:22.610 --> 19:26.044
to the bandwagon effect
a given juror might be.

19:26.046 --> 19:29.355
Forgive me, but that is
a really beautiful charm

19:29.357 --> 19:31.149
you have hanging from your neck.

19:31.151 --> 19:32.651
Oh, thank you.

19:32.653 --> 19:34.720
I-It's just a heart on a chain.

19:34.722 --> 19:37.222
<i>Most people want to be
part of the majority.</i>

19:37.643 --> 19:39.283
<i>It's just a human trait
to want to belong.</i>

19:39.285 --> 19:42.853
<i>By and large, we all want
to hop on that bandwagon.</i>

19:42.855 --> 19:44.055
No, it's pretty.

19:44.057 --> 19:47.336
Anyone else here wearing
a heart on a chain?

19:48.094 --> 19:51.162
Also very pretty.

19:51.164 --> 19:52.763
Anyone else have one at home

19:52.765 --> 19:54.331
that maybe they're not wearing today?

19:54.333 --> 19:55.433
Ah.

19:55.435 --> 19:57.668
And how about you guys? Does your wife

19:57.670 --> 19:59.036
or your girlfriend or your mother

19:59.038 --> 20:03.474
or sister or your significant
other have one of those?

20:03.476 --> 20:05.097
Yeah, I got her one. Yeah, I got her one

20:05.099 --> 20:07.340
- for Valentine's Day.
- She definitely has one of those.

20:07.364 --> 20:08.179
Now, you, sir.

20:08.181 --> 20:09.447
What's going on?

20:09.449 --> 20:11.159
You're just not sure?

20:11.161 --> 20:12.574
Oh, no. I'm sure.

20:12.576 --> 20:15.352
Uh, my wife doesn't
own anything like that.

20:15.354 --> 20:17.788
- Would you like her to?
- No.

20:17.790 --> 20:20.491
I'm pretty content with the way
she accessorizes herself.

20:20.493 --> 20:21.959
No charm on a chain?

20:21.961 --> 20:24.495
A little heart?
Maybe a cross, or a flower?

20:24.497 --> 20:27.198
No. She's got a nipple ring I'm fond of.

20:30.882 --> 20:32.707
Your Honor, the prosecution would like...

20:32.709 --> 20:35.673
I'm way ahead of you.

20:40.580 --> 20:42.780
Hey, Cable!

20:46.567 --> 20:49.001
Dr. Bull. How'd it go?

20:49.003 --> 20:51.370
Well, you'll have to ask Mr. Flanigan.

20:51.372 --> 20:53.739
Now I know what it feels like
to be a Muppet.

20:53.741 --> 20:56.409
The good doctor here shoves
his hand up your back,

20:56.411 --> 20:57.910
moves you around the courtroom,

20:57.912 --> 20:58.855
tells you what to say

20:58.880 --> 21:00.246
and how to say it.

21:00.248 --> 21:01.781
And it works.

21:01.783 --> 21:03.416
I think we got the jury we wanted.

21:03.418 --> 21:05.418
Fozzie Bear, you're making me blush.

21:05.420 --> 21:07.253
That's great.
I just wanted to let you know

21:07.255 --> 21:09.495
that I've been working out
of the public library all day,

21:09.519 --> 21:12.091
e-mailing with
Dr. Desmond Tatlock of MIT,

21:12.093 --> 21:15.094
and we've come up with a little
demonstration to illustrate

21:15.096 --> 21:17.663
why Malcolm's alibi
isn't really an alibi.

21:17.665 --> 21:19.465
That you don't actually have
to be present

21:19.467 --> 21:22.234
and perform the hack at the time
the hack is executed.

21:22.236 --> 21:24.070
I think you're really gonna love it.

21:24.072 --> 21:25.438
Just like you said.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.139
She's our cyber prodigy.

21:28.476 --> 21:30.276
Hey, any word on whether or not

21:30.278 --> 21:32.478
I can actually get a look
at the FAA server?

21:32.480 --> 21:34.180
Ah, all set up.

21:34.182 --> 21:37.183
Tomorrow afternoon, 3:00 p.m.,
FBI headquarters.

21:37.185 --> 21:38.960
Everything's on this card.

21:38.962 --> 21:40.216
Great.

21:40.455 --> 21:42.488
Well, good luck in court.

21:42.490 --> 21:44.156
Good luck with the server.

21:48.666 --> 21:49.895
<i>Dr. Tatlock,</i>

21:49.897 --> 21:51.764
have you conducted a forensic analysis

21:51.766 --> 21:53.566
of the compromised server

21:53.568 --> 21:56.001
and Malcolm Swift's cyber signature?

21:56.215 --> 21:57.436
I... yes, I have.

21:57.438 --> 21:59.105
And what did you determine?

21:59.107 --> 22:02.675
When I examined the cyber trail,
I determined that Swift

22:02.677 --> 22:04.477
connected to a wireless access protocol,

22:04.479 --> 22:07.613
and then a unique binary
coding sequence was employed

22:07.615 --> 22:10.095
- to override secure socket layers...
- Sorry to interrupt you,

22:10.119 --> 22:12.585
Dr. Tatlock, but can you
explain that in a way

22:12.587 --> 22:14.954
that those of us who don't use a computer

22:14.956 --> 22:16.522
for anything other than e-mail

22:16.524 --> 22:18.691
- might understand?
- Sure.

22:18.693 --> 22:20.192
When you get on your computer

22:20.194 --> 22:22.294
to order sweat socks over the Internet,

22:22.296 --> 22:24.563
your computer offers up a key to the site

22:24.565 --> 22:25.865
you're trying to buy from.

22:25.867 --> 22:29.935
And that key allows you to do
just one thing: buy stuff.

22:29.937 --> 22:31.270
You can't change the price,

22:31.272 --> 22:33.139
you can't change
the pictures of the socks.

22:33.141 --> 22:34.874
You get the idea. Now, in the case

22:34.876 --> 22:36.142
of air traffic control,

22:36.144 --> 22:38.244
the layers of protection are <i> enormous.</i>

22:38.246 --> 22:40.779
Probably a million times more complex

22:40.781 --> 22:42.815
than at our sock-buying website.

22:42.817 --> 22:46.252
Very few people in the world...
you can count them on one hand...

22:46.254 --> 22:47.553
have the skill

22:47.555 --> 22:49.677
and the tools and the time

22:49.679 --> 22:51.557
to defeat all the layers of protection

22:51.559 --> 22:53.209
that the federal government

22:53.211 --> 22:55.728
has created to make certain that no one

22:55.730 --> 22:59.198
except authorized personnel
can view the site,

22:59.200 --> 23:02.234
and no one except
at the highest levels of the FAA

23:02.236 --> 23:04.370
can manipulate the site.

23:04.372 --> 23:07.139
And it's not just a single command,

23:07.141 --> 23:09.441
or a line of code
that you need to create...

23:09.443 --> 23:11.710
it's really more akin to an onion

23:11.712 --> 23:15.714
whose layers have to be
peeled back one by one

23:15.716 --> 23:17.716
in exactly the right order

23:17.718 --> 23:19.618
and in exactly the right way.

23:19.620 --> 23:23.222
But once he was able to do it,
it was like he had a key,

23:23.224 --> 23:26.654
and he could pretty much do
what he wanted without anyone

23:26.656 --> 23:27.764
knowing about it.

23:27.789 --> 23:29.995
They are right with this.

23:29.997 --> 23:33.566
All 12 are following along,
and all 12 are solid green.

23:33.568 --> 23:35.234
Okay, that helps.

23:35.236 --> 23:38.837
But explain to me, how are you
able to say with such certainty

23:38.839 --> 23:41.340
that it's Mr. Swift who did this?

23:41.342 --> 23:42.454
Well, that's where

23:42.456 --> 23:45.611
the cyber signature comes in...
it's like a digital fingerprint.

23:45.613 --> 23:47.746
No two are exactly alike.

23:47.748 --> 23:50.816
Now, with practice and the right tools,

23:50.818 --> 23:54.853
it's theoretically possible to
almost duplicate someone else's,

23:54.855 --> 23:56.956
but the key word is "almost."

23:56.958 --> 23:59.058
You'll never get it exactly right.

23:59.060 --> 24:00.960
There are really
just too many variables...

24:00.962 --> 24:02.394
in the billions.

24:03.008 --> 24:05.030
That's because there's
no <i> one</i> way to do this.

24:05.386 --> 24:07.733
Each hacker has his or her own way.

24:07.735 --> 24:09.735
And this particular hack,

24:09.737 --> 24:13.305
it definitively bears
the signature of Mr. Swift.

24:13.307 --> 24:15.241
Looks like a forest in here.

24:15.243 --> 24:18.377
Not a flicker of yellow,
not a flicker of red.

24:18.379 --> 24:20.079
I love it when it's easy.

24:20.081 --> 24:22.514
I don't trust it... but I love it.

24:22.516 --> 24:24.283
Now, are you aware

24:24.285 --> 24:26.518
that Mr. Swift has filed an affidavit

24:26.520 --> 24:29.355
claiming that he was working
at the time of the intrusion

24:29.357 --> 24:31.442
into the air traffic control system?

24:31.444 --> 24:32.942
I'm sure he was.

24:32.944 --> 24:35.494
But offering that as an excuse
is like saying

24:35.496 --> 24:37.196
you couldn't watch your favorite TV show

24:37.198 --> 24:39.498
because you weren't at home
when it was on.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.033
Once you have access to that system,

24:41.035 --> 24:43.168
you can set the time
for the event to happen

24:43.170 --> 24:44.770
and just walk away.

24:45.092 --> 24:46.805
Here, let me show you what I mean.

24:47.344 --> 24:48.705
Can I ask everyone in the courtroom

24:48.729 --> 24:50.142
to take out their cell phones?

24:50.144 --> 24:51.577
Be my guest.

24:51.579 --> 24:53.112
Now, remember,

24:53.114 --> 24:55.047
we've asked that they all be silenced.

24:55.049 --> 24:56.815
It won't matter.

24:56.817 --> 24:57.983
Three,

24:57.985 --> 25:00.019
two... one.

25:17.805 --> 25:19.734
I created that hack

25:19.736 --> 25:21.407
last night.

25:21.409 --> 25:24.777
But, obviously, I'm here, testifying.

25:24.779 --> 25:28.347
Doesn't mean I didn't design
and execute the hack.

25:28.349 --> 25:30.262
No further questions.

25:42.096 --> 25:44.663
I'll need to hold on to your phone.

25:44.665 --> 25:47.132
It'll take a minute to check
your computer for malware.

25:47.134 --> 25:48.500
You can put your things

25:48.502 --> 25:49.902
back in your purse.

25:49.904 --> 25:52.271
Can you do your work
wearing latex gloves?

25:52.273 --> 25:53.472
I think so.

25:53.474 --> 25:55.441
The server has been placed
for you in that room.

25:55.824 --> 25:57.509
Once I give you your computer back,

25:57.511 --> 25:59.375
<i>you have 45 minutes.</i>

26:28.142 --> 26:31.243
Don't be him. Don't be him. Don't be him.

26:48.929 --> 26:51.330
That's not good enough, boys.

27:03.911 --> 27:05.878
All right, Sarah,

27:05.880 --> 27:07.234
this is for you.

27:09.383 --> 27:11.550
Fingers crossed.

27:13.621 --> 27:14.820
Okay.

27:23.664 --> 27:25.764
Mm-hmm.

27:27.301 --> 27:29.701
Janet. Janet.

27:29.703 --> 27:32.304
Janet, Janet, Janet, Janet.

27:32.306 --> 27:34.373
Sarah, you might have
a bigger problem on your hands

27:34.375 --> 27:35.735
than just getting yourself pregnant

27:35.759 --> 27:37.109
by an accused terrorist.

27:51.225 --> 27:52.825
Damn.

27:57.164 --> 27:58.330
Wha...? No.

27:58.332 --> 27:59.631
No. No. No.

27:59.633 --> 28:02.167
No, stop. What are you doing? Stop!

28:27.365 --> 28:28.731
Huh.

28:28.733 --> 28:30.165
Cable.

28:30.167 --> 28:32.301
I'm so sorry, Dr. Bull.

28:34.696 --> 28:36.605
I think I messed up.

28:38.175 --> 28:40.876
I think I messed up big-time.

28:41.286 --> 28:43.145
How long have you been sitting here?

28:44.081 --> 28:46.382
Uh, since about 11:30 last night.

28:47.379 --> 28:48.619
Let's get you something to eat.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.103
<i>I wanted to compare</i>

28:50.105 --> 28:52.881
the admitted cyber signature
with the one from the hack.

28:53.642 --> 28:55.342
I thought...

28:55.777 --> 28:58.387
I could prove Malcolm was innocent.

28:58.714 --> 29:01.614
Instead, I'm pretty sure
I infected the server

29:01.616 --> 29:03.283
with a virus.

29:03.285 --> 29:05.518
Basically fried it.

29:07.155 --> 29:09.106
All the evidence is gone.

29:10.085 --> 29:12.218
It's just blank.

29:14.429 --> 29:16.947
There's nothing to convict anyone with.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.494
My friend Sarah set me up.

29:35.717 --> 29:37.759
Please say something.

29:38.887 --> 29:41.096
What is there to say?

29:42.491 --> 29:44.474
You tampered with evidence, Cable.

29:46.534 --> 29:48.770
You committed a federal crime.

29:54.469 --> 29:55.944
You wanted to see me?

29:59.448 --> 30:01.107
God, you look terrible.

30:01.109 --> 30:02.454
Have you been drinking?

30:02.456 --> 30:05.578
No. I won't lie... I have been
waiting for someone to tell me

30:05.580 --> 30:07.614
it's late enough
in the afternoon so I <i> can.</i>

30:07.616 --> 30:09.948
Well, it's 10:20 in the morning,

30:09.950 --> 30:12.127
so you have a little ways to go.

30:13.388 --> 30:15.822
What can I do for you?

30:16.691 --> 30:18.358
You got any juice with the FBI?

30:18.359 --> 30:19.759
What kind of question is that?

30:19.761 --> 30:21.841
It's the kind of question
you ask when you're staring

30:21.865 --> 30:23.662
at a mistrial
in a federal terrorism case.

30:23.664 --> 30:25.264
Actually, a mistrial I could handle.

30:25.266 --> 30:28.033
We could at least regroup
and try the bastard again.

30:28.035 --> 30:32.104
No, this will be a mistrial
with... prejudice.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.975
Cable is part of the prosecution's team.

30:35.977 --> 30:39.445
She tampered with evidence,

30:39.447 --> 30:41.847
and the case is almost certainly
gonna be thrown out of court

30:41.849 --> 30:43.949
on the grounds
of prosecutorial misconduct,

30:43.951 --> 30:48.487
and no one will ever be able
to try Malcolm again, ever.

30:49.357 --> 30:50.923
Unless...

30:50.925 --> 30:53.793
the defense doesn't find out
it was Cable.

30:55.420 --> 30:58.048
You got any juice with the FBI?

31:06.073 --> 31:07.740
Long time no see.

31:07.742 --> 31:11.110
No see, no hear...

31:11.112 --> 31:12.688
no nothin'.

31:13.772 --> 31:16.282
Well, clearly, my staying away
has done wonders for you...

31:16.284 --> 31:17.683
you look great.

31:19.020 --> 31:20.619
90 days of rehab

31:20.621 --> 31:23.255
and a reassignment to Washington, well...

31:24.192 --> 31:25.724
Wow. Washington, huh?

31:25.726 --> 31:27.459
That's what you wanted, right?

31:27.461 --> 31:28.861
I already started training.

31:28.863 --> 31:32.531
In May, I... I start running
one of the criminology labs.

31:33.434 --> 31:35.167
I'm really happy for you.

31:35.169 --> 31:37.169
Happy for me, too.

31:37.421 --> 31:39.305
Something from the bar?

31:39.307 --> 31:41.425
Oh, uh, just black coffee.

31:44.912 --> 31:46.145
So...

31:46.147 --> 31:47.613
why'd you want to see me?

31:47.615 --> 31:50.149
I mean, I get it...
you know, there's no...

31:50.434 --> 31:51.817
there's no us.

31:52.269 --> 31:53.652
I need a favor.

31:55.605 --> 31:57.289
A second favor.

31:57.733 --> 32:00.226
I mean, you already saved
my life once, so I guess...

32:00.736 --> 32:03.729
that makes me the most
ungrateful person in the world.

32:04.732 --> 32:07.967
Look, I got to...
I got to tell you something.

32:08.952 --> 32:10.769
I know the papers, the TV

32:10.771 --> 32:12.471
and the Bureau, they...

32:12.831 --> 32:15.207
say I took a bullet in the leg for you.

32:15.209 --> 32:16.842
And it's a good story.

32:17.419 --> 32:19.778
But, Danny, come on.

32:19.780 --> 32:21.080
You know better.

32:21.882 --> 32:23.549
It's not like I saw the bullet coming

32:23.551 --> 32:25.761
and I stepped in front of it.

32:26.762 --> 32:28.354
That's the movies.

32:28.972 --> 32:30.789
If I'd have known that
was coming towards us,

32:30.791 --> 32:33.125
I'd... have been out of there

32:33.127 --> 32:34.827
quicker than a whore in church.

32:36.772 --> 32:40.192
Now, what's your favor? What you need?

33:08.430 --> 33:10.863
_

33:30.398 --> 33:31.968
All right, three things.

33:32.653 --> 33:35.054
One, I miss my cell phone.

33:35.523 --> 33:36.889
Two, I'm sick of winter.

33:36.891 --> 33:38.491
And three...

33:38.493 --> 33:40.693
I don't care what
all you diet people say,

33:40.695 --> 33:41.961
I want pizza for lunch.

33:41.963 --> 33:43.195
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:43.197 --> 33:45.965
FBI! Everyone, put your hands in the air!

33:47.267 --> 33:48.347
Don't touch your computers.

33:48.371 --> 33:49.904
Don't touch anything. Nobody move.

33:51.672 --> 33:52.672
I'm Dr. Jason Bull.

33:52.674 --> 33:53.806
Can I help you?

33:53.808 --> 33:55.241
- Cable McCrory?
- Yes.

33:55.243 --> 33:56.475
You have the right to remain silent.

33:56.477 --> 33:57.677
Anything you say can and will

33:57.679 --> 33:59.111
be used against you in a court of law.

33:59.113 --> 34:00.746
You have the right to an attorney.

34:00.748 --> 34:03.148
If you cannot afford one, the
court will appoint one for you.

34:03.172 --> 34:04.984
Ladies, gentlemen,
there must be some mistake.

34:04.986 --> 34:06.452
I'm Benjamin Colón. I'm her attorney.

34:06.454 --> 34:07.694
What is she being charged with?

34:07.718 --> 34:08.920
Evidence tempering.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.882
Don't speak to anyone
without Benny present.

34:10.907 --> 34:11.972
Go with her.

34:12.592 --> 34:13.859
Don't worry, Cable.

34:13.860 --> 34:15.527
We'll figure something out.

34:15.530 --> 34:17.463
Hang in there, Cable.

34:28.550 --> 34:29.875
I asked you for a favor.

34:29.877 --> 34:31.777
I know, but how many times
can you expect a guy

34:31.779 --> 34:33.145
to save your life?

34:49.420 --> 34:52.779
A member of the prosecution's
team tampered with evidence.

34:52.806 --> 34:54.906
I would request that
the case be thrown out

34:54.908 --> 34:56.741
on the grounds of
prosecutorial misconduct.

34:56.743 --> 34:59.945
Your Honor, the perpetrator
in question acted

34:59.947 --> 35:02.080
without the prosecution's
knowledge or consent.

35:02.082 --> 35:04.182
She was manipulated
into accessing the server

35:04.184 --> 35:06.051
by an outside party.

35:06.053 --> 35:08.186
This falls at your feet.

35:08.188 --> 35:10.055
Because of your team's negligence,

35:10.057 --> 35:13.159
a man who is quite possibly
guilty is going to go free.

35:13.161 --> 35:14.359
That's the law.

35:14.361 --> 35:16.127
I hope you have as much trouble

35:16.129 --> 35:17.829
sleeping tonight as I will.

35:17.831 --> 35:21.132
I'm going to declare a mistrial
with prejudice.

35:22.936 --> 35:24.035
The charges against

35:24.037 --> 35:25.971
Malcolm Swift will be dropped,

35:25.973 --> 35:29.241
with no possibility of his
being retried for this crime.

35:47.928 --> 35:49.761
It's really good to see you guys.

35:50.340 --> 35:52.163
Hang in there, kid.

35:52.165 --> 35:53.431
I'm trying.

35:53.927 --> 35:55.533
Just give me a reason.

35:55.535 --> 35:57.335
I'd love to be able to do that, Cable,

35:57.337 --> 36:01.142
but... there's very little good
on the menu.

36:01.708 --> 36:03.842
You're staring at five years.

36:05.746 --> 36:09.080
Our friend, Mr. Flanigan,
is gonna lose his job.

36:09.082 --> 36:11.116
But before he goes, he's gonna make sure

36:11.118 --> 36:12.737
that you get the maximum.

36:13.320 --> 36:15.120
Benny's gonna represent you at trial,

36:15.122 --> 36:19.658
and... at TAC, we will do
everything we can to help.

36:20.287 --> 36:22.794
Talk to Sarah.
She's got to know something.

36:22.796 --> 36:24.749
Sarah's disappeared.

36:25.232 --> 36:27.365
I doubt she's still in the country.

36:30.370 --> 36:32.007
Fantastic.

36:32.472 --> 36:35.140
She's gone, Malcolm's a free man,

36:35.142 --> 36:37.642
I'm in prison, and I helped a terrorist

36:37.644 --> 36:40.011
win his freedom so that
he could try again.

36:40.013 --> 36:41.479
No, come on.

36:41.481 --> 36:45.784
Hey, stop beating yourself up, okay?

36:45.786 --> 36:48.353
He played you. He played all of us.

36:48.355 --> 36:51.723
Now, we've been going through
this whole thing in our head,

36:51.725 --> 36:54.559
trying to find something else
to charge Malcolm with,

36:54.561 --> 36:57.128
something that we can make stick.

37:00.667 --> 37:05.437
Well, you know, when I was
downloading the flash drive

37:05.439 --> 37:06.916
onto my laptop,

37:07.674 --> 37:10.642
I was watching the code spill out,

37:10.644 --> 37:12.585
and there was this word...

37:12.585 --> 37:16.687
I mean, it's not a word so much
as it is a bunch of code,

37:16.689 --> 37:18.178
but it...

37:18.991 --> 37:20.930
it kind of looked like a word.

37:22.390 --> 37:23.627
"Janet."

37:24.184 --> 37:27.064
J-A-N-E-T.

37:27.395 --> 37:29.066
Like the girl's name.

37:29.068 --> 37:31.735
Wait, where you going with that?

37:31.737 --> 37:33.537
I honestly don't know, Dr. Bull.

37:33.539 --> 37:35.528
It really could be nothing.

37:36.309 --> 37:38.909
Hackers use abbreviations
and acronyms all the time

37:38.911 --> 37:40.367
in their code.

37:41.447 --> 37:42.994
I just, uh...

37:43.316 --> 37:45.716
I never came across "JANET" before.

37:45.718 --> 37:47.484
<i>The only thing I have found</i>

37:47.486 --> 37:49.186
that makes any sense at all is a secret

37:49.188 --> 37:52.089
U.S. government airline.
Code name: JANET.

37:52.091 --> 37:55.492
It stands for Joint Air
Network Employee Transportation.

37:55.494 --> 38:00.231
Really? A secret airline.
And what is its purpose?

38:00.233 --> 38:03.434
Well, it's top secret, so that's
a little difficult to say,

38:03.436 --> 38:06.103
but it is operated by
the United States Air Force

38:06.105 --> 38:10.641
to transport military
and defense contract employees,

38:10.643 --> 38:12.042
safely and discreetly.

38:12.044 --> 38:14.144
It flies around the world
to military bases

38:14.146 --> 38:15.446
in classified areas.

38:15.448 --> 38:18.349
So this secret airline
transports some of the most

38:18.351 --> 38:20.907
important military personnel
in the country,

38:21.146 --> 38:22.586
and no one knows where they're going.

38:22.588 --> 38:26.557
Uh, just the U.S. Air Force
and air traffic control.

38:29.295 --> 38:30.794
What's so funny, boss?

38:31.209 --> 38:32.896
You know how I've said from the beginning

38:32.898 --> 38:34.465
I couldn't figure out Malcolm's motive.

38:34.467 --> 38:35.733
I couldn't figure out

38:35.735 --> 38:37.175
why he took over air traffic control,

38:37.199 --> 38:38.602
and then didn't do anything with it.

38:38.604 --> 38:40.304
He didn't issue any ransom demands,

38:40.306 --> 38:42.940
he didn't let those planes crash.

38:42.942 --> 38:45.042
He didn't even have some
terrorist organization

38:45.044 --> 38:47.344
take credit for the momentary chaos.

38:48.814 --> 38:50.814
<i>What if everything
that happened that night</i>

38:50.816 --> 38:52.383
wasn't the point at all?

38:52.385 --> 38:53.984
What if it wasn't about that airport

38:53.986 --> 38:55.919
or those planes?

38:55.921 --> 38:57.488
What if it was all a diversion?

38:57.490 --> 38:58.589
How do you mean?

38:58.591 --> 39:00.591
Well, what if he was executing one hack

39:00.593 --> 39:02.593
to draw attention away from another?

39:03.116 --> 39:05.329
You think he was hacking into JANET?

39:05.331 --> 39:07.031
I bet that information's worth

39:07.033 --> 39:08.632
hundreds of millions of dollars.

39:08.634 --> 39:11.735
Knowing what planes our military
leaders are gonna be on,

39:11.737 --> 39:14.038
where they're going,
when they're gonna get there,

39:14.040 --> 39:15.539
or not get there,

39:15.541 --> 39:18.208
depending on how you choose
to use that information.

39:18.210 --> 39:19.777
It was all about the money.

39:19.779 --> 39:21.412
It almost always is.

39:21.414 --> 39:22.713
But it's just a theory,

39:22.715 --> 39:25.683
and one I'm not sure I know how to prove.

39:27.849 --> 39:29.553
I think I might have a flash drive

39:29.555 --> 39:31.689
that you might find helpful.

39:31.691 --> 39:33.791
- Mm?
- I keep

39:33.793 --> 39:36.627
a hoodie in the office...

39:36.941 --> 39:39.196
hanging in the kitchen.

39:40.445 --> 39:42.032
Left pocket.

39:48.453 --> 39:49.654
Thanks for coming.

39:49.656 --> 39:51.975
Marissa told me this was
your preferred style of venue

39:51.977 --> 39:53.644
for clandestine meetings.

39:53.646 --> 39:55.612
I don't find any of this amusing.

39:56.127 --> 39:57.607
I've worked for the federal government

39:57.631 --> 39:59.183
for 26 years.

39:59.185 --> 40:01.485
I'd hoped to get at least ten more.

40:01.487 --> 40:04.121
That seems unlikely at the moment.

40:04.123 --> 40:07.191
Believe me, I feel terrible
about what's happened,

40:07.193 --> 40:08.727
I really do, but...

40:09.933 --> 40:11.762
I have some new information.

40:12.352 --> 40:14.698
And if it's correct,
I think we can right this wrong,

40:14.700 --> 40:17.067
bring Malcolm to justice.

40:18.371 --> 40:20.704
We think we know
what Malcolm was really up to

40:20.706 --> 40:23.307
that night he hacked
into the air traffic control.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.876
And it wasn't about crashing
passenger jets.

40:25.878 --> 40:27.444
It was much bigger.

40:27.446 --> 40:29.146
What are you talking about?

40:29.148 --> 40:31.415
I have physical evidence
to back up this theory,

40:31.417 --> 40:33.498
and I'm prepared to surrender it, but...

40:34.457 --> 40:36.620
I'd appreciate something in return.

40:36.622 --> 40:38.622
This is about your employee.

40:38.624 --> 40:39.796
It is.

40:40.359 --> 40:42.760
In truth, she's the one who figured out

40:42.762 --> 40:44.495
Malcolm's real motive.

40:44.497 --> 40:46.897
And she's the one supplying
the physical evidence

40:46.899 --> 40:49.666
that I believe
will ultimately convict him.

40:50.536 --> 40:52.202
What do you got?

40:52.725 --> 40:54.071
<i>And in national news,</i>

40:54.073 --> 40:56.774
our lead story... in a surprising twist,

40:56.776 --> 40:59.376
accused terrorist Malcolm Swift
is headed back to prison,

40:59.378 --> 41:02.479
this time for attempting to sell
secret military information

41:02.481 --> 41:04.782
to governments hostile
to the United States.

41:04.784 --> 41:06.717
Next update in less than ten minutes.

41:06.719 --> 41:08.619
You're listening to...

41:17.530 --> 41:18.796
Oh!

41:28.469 --> 41:30.874
I just want to tell you how grateful I am

41:30.876 --> 41:33.177
for everything you've done.

41:33.179 --> 41:35.913
I appreciate it
more than you'll ever know.

41:38.984 --> 41:42.252
And I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

41:49.741 --> 41:51.195
Are you being facetious?

41:51.197 --> 41:52.535
No.

41:54.621 --> 41:57.067
I'm trying to be considerate
of your feelings.

41:57.665 --> 41:59.937
Trying to be professional.

42:01.540 --> 42:02.940
I'm trying to find a way to tell you

42:02.942 --> 42:04.575
you're no longer working at TAC

42:04.577 --> 42:06.910
without making you feel
worse than you already do.

42:06.912 --> 42:11.114
And frankly, without making me
feel worse than I already do.

42:12.117 --> 42:13.640
Cable...

42:15.037 --> 42:16.220
you broke the law.

42:16.930 --> 42:17.941
You put the case at risk.

42:17.943 --> 42:19.556
You put me and my company at risk.

42:19.558 --> 42:21.058
You put the entire country at risk.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.135
Excuse me, sir,

42:22.160 --> 42:23.560
- And you planned it.
- can you please pull over?

42:23.562 --> 42:24.695
Snuck that drive into FBI headquarters.

42:24.697 --> 42:26.163
- I need to get out of the car.
- Defied me when I

42:26.165 --> 42:28.285
- told you to have...
- Can you let me out of the car?

42:28.309 --> 42:29.700
...no more contact with that woman.

42:29.702 --> 42:31.869
Cable! Get back in the car!

42:39.678 --> 42:40.944
Damn it.

42:40.946 --> 42:42.479
Excuse me, sir.

42:42.481 --> 42:43.680
What do you want to do now?

42:43.682 --> 42:45.382
You want me to follow her with the car?

42:45.797 --> 42:47.484
No.

42:48.007 --> 42:49.319
I just got her out of jail.

42:49.321 --> 42:52.055
I guess this is her way
of saying thank you.

42:52.057 --> 42:54.391
I don't follow you, sir.

42:57.517 --> 42:59.096
Never mind.

42:59.602 --> 43:01.999
Just take me back to the office.
