00:23.114 --> 00:24.942
In the criminal justice system,

00:24.942 --> 00:28.704
sexually-based offenses
are considered especially heinous

00:28.704 --> 00:29.909
In New York City,

00:29.909 --> 00:33.410
the dedicated detectives who investigate
these vicious felonies are members

00:33.410 --> 00:36.454
of an elite squad known
as The Special Victims Unit.

00:36.454 --> 00:38.662
These are their stories.

00:48.941 --> 00:51.495
So you going Britney Spears on me
now or what?

00:51.495 --> 00:53.181
Eartha Kitt.

00:53.181 --> 00:54.564
Who?

01:01.129 --> 01:03.021
I gotta run.

01:04.538 --> 01:06.251
Hi. Where's Mom?

01:06.251 --> 01:09.106
Took the twins to Joey Stemple' s
birthday party. That your boyfriend?

01:09.106 --> 01:10.526
No.

01:10.526 --> 01:12.368
- Introduce me.
- No.

01:13.404 --> 01:15.651
How long has he been out of prison?

01:15.808 --> 01:17.970
- Dad, stop.
- What's his name?

01:17.970 --> 01:20.393
- Ryan Witherspoon.
- Witherspoon?

01:20.393 --> 01:21.889
He go to your school?

01:22.271 --> 01:25.771
He's going to post next year, okay?

01:28.343 --> 01:30.963
Okay, I guess he's cute.

01:34.348 --> 01:36.320
On the LIE a multi-vehicle accident

01:36.320 --> 01:39.529
just before the mid-town tunnel
has traffic clogged up...

01:41.474 --> 01:43.198
Is that a tattoo?

01:44.037 --> 01:45.250
No.

01:46.563 --> 01:47.830
Where'd you get it?

01:47.830 --> 01:49.284
Well, you've got tattoos.

01:49.284 --> 01:51.939
I was 18 and in the service.

01:52.124 --> 01:55.543
It's henna. It washes off.

01:56.067 --> 01:57.708
Why didn't you just tell me that?

01:57.708 --> 02:01.347
I just did. You're such a cop.

02:01.347 --> 02:03.745
Yeah, wait till you have kids.

02:04.902 --> 02:07.535
All the little Witherspoons.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.075
Move.

02:19.226 --> 02:22.757
Stay here, lock the doors,
roll up that window.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.994
Stabler, Manhattan SVU, watch yourself.

02:32.994 --> 02:35.382
Hurry up, there's someone under there.

02:38.473 --> 02:39.750
Get it out!

02:40.471 --> 02:43.253
All right, call it in, secure the scene.

02:52.918 --> 02:54.242
Don't look at that.

02:57.410 --> 02:59.049
Don't look at that.

03:00.424 --> 03:03.741
It's all right. It's all right.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC: 2000/10/20

03:55.725 --> 03:57.545
Capt. Cragen...

03:57.545 --> 03:59.828
one of your detectives reports

03:59.828 --> 04:04.298
while bar hopping picking up a suspect
and having sex with him.

04:04.298 --> 04:08.124
Another confesses to fantasies
about killing suspects.

04:08.124 --> 04:11.458
Just what kind of unit
are you running, Captain?

04:11.458 --> 04:14.529
I was told that, whatever the results

04:14.529 --> 04:19.370
that, the actual content of these psych
evaluations would be kept private.

04:19.370 --> 04:21.440
Doctor-patient privilege is sacrosanct.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.443
Promiscuity and fantasies of murder?

04:24.443 --> 04:28.437
Detectives Jeffries and Stabler will
undergo further evaluation

04:28.437 --> 04:32.197
and will submit formal explanations
to this committee.

04:32.197 --> 04:36.888
I have assigned prosecutor
A.D.A. Cabot to adjudicate SVU cases.

04:36.888 --> 04:40.940
You will apprise A.D.A. Cabot
of your case file asap.

04:40.940 --> 04:43.210
If l... / Robbery unit next.

04:46.670 --> 04:48.082
Capt. Cragen?

04:48.276 --> 04:49.485
Miss Cabot. / Alex.

04:49.485 --> 04:51.681
Yeah, right, of course.

04:54.271 --> 04:56.257
Let's not start off on the wrong foot.

04:56.257 --> 05:00.633
My assignment to SVU preceded the
behavioral problems under your command.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.496
Behavioral problems?

05:02.496 --> 05:05.518
- I'm trying to be polite.
- Tiptoeing around the road kill?

05:05.518 --> 05:08.546
- Where there's smoke.
- Who do you sleep with, Miss Cabot?

05:08.546 --> 05:09.939
Are you so new at this

05:09.939 --> 05:13.053
that you haven't run into somebody
you'd like to skip due process with?

05:13.053 --> 05:16.512
I'll apprise you asap
if asap can be tomorrow.

05:16.512 --> 05:19.835
You understand,
I have behavioral issues.

05:19.835 --> 05:21.196
Certainly.

05:21.694 --> 05:23.886
Breakfast, then?

05:25.334 --> 05:28.217
Two unis and a robbery detective
from the 17

05:28.217 --> 05:29.774
were kicked over to Public Affairs.

05:29.774 --> 05:31.716
- Reevaluation stinks.
- Truly.

05:31.716 --> 05:35.137
Best crime stats in 30 years and
they're reevaluating? / It's how it works.

05:35.137 --> 05:37.482
We get rid of the criminals they fear
they start fearing us.

05:37.482 --> 05:39.512
Public hates tough cops,
until they need one.

05:39.512 --> 05:42.322
Jeffries, my office.

05:46.907 --> 05:49.830
You told the psychologist you
slept with a suspect?

05:49.830 --> 05:51.735
What? No, that's not what I said.

05:51.735 --> 05:54.850
Well, that's how they interpreted it.

05:55.130 --> 05:56.842
I'm gonna limit your field time.

05:56.842 --> 05:58.990
You're giving me desk duty?

05:58.990 --> 06:01.893
You need time to prepare a formal response
for the Morris Commission.

06:01.893 --> 06:04.713
I am not explaining my sex life
to the Morris Commission!

06:04.713 --> 06:06.234
That's enough!

06:06.617 --> 06:11.344
I don't like it either, Monique but
yelling at me is not gonna solve anything.

06:14.682 --> 06:16.758
Jimmy Buffet in town?

06:17.401 --> 06:19.328
I was taking Maureen home
from the beach

06:19.328 --> 06:23.112
see two uniforms fighting this fire up
by Black Bank Marsh.

06:23.112 --> 06:25.164
I stop to help turns out to be a body,

06:25.164 --> 06:28.450
gunshot wound to the head
flames leaping off the crotch.

06:28.450 --> 06:30.235
My daughter sees the whole thing.

06:30.235 --> 06:31.188
Is she all right?

06:31.188 --> 06:33.633
I don't know, Kathy picked her up.
I was on the scene all night.

06:33.633 --> 06:35.096
In Queens?

06:36.009 --> 06:40.186
Dump job. Looks like the victim was
shot in his West Side apartment.

06:40.186 --> 06:41.168
Elliot.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.443
- Off to a scene.
- Now.

06:45.788 --> 06:47.297
You okay?

06:49.734 --> 06:52.574
What possessed you to tell the shrink
in your psych evaluation

06:52.574 --> 06:54.516
that you fantasized about killing suspects?

06:54.516 --> 06:56.783
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

06:56.932 --> 06:58.887
I said perps not suspects.

06:58.887 --> 07:01.889
Well, the Morris Commission
doesn't see a distinction.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.824
They're inquiring.

07:04.371 --> 07:06.889
Inquiring into what?
My private thoughts?

07:06.889 --> 07:11.151
They're supposed to be house-cleaning
the department of rogue cops.

07:16.806 --> 07:18.873
My job at risk?

07:20.301 --> 07:21.744
Yeah.

07:27.087 --> 07:29.296
Amsterdam Apartments
103 Willow Street Brooklyn Heights
Monday, September 11

07:29.296 --> 07:31.442
Victim's Andrew Croft, 42.

07:31.442 --> 07:33.192
Dumped vehicle may be a Lexus.

07:33.192 --> 07:35.801
DMV has one registered to
this address it's missing.

07:35.801 --> 07:37.291
Was he packing or unpacking?

07:37.291 --> 07:41.269
He was transferred here a month ago
by his new company, Radial Velocity.

07:41.269 --> 07:42.989
- Radial Velocity?
- Yeah.

07:42.989 --> 07:45.745
Edge-of-the-envelope defense contractor?
What's he do for them?

07:45.745 --> 07:47.172
I'm still on his home life.

07:47.172 --> 07:50.523
He's single, lived with his son,
Michael approximately 16.

07:50.523 --> 07:52.931
Neighbors say that they argued a lot.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.919
Serious feng shui problem.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.283
Neighbors hear this argument?

08:00.283 --> 08:02.505
Everyone was out.
Beach, the park.

08:02.505 --> 08:03.935
This the son?

08:03.935 --> 08:05.358
Probably an old picture.

08:05.358 --> 08:07.601
I found some books labeled MacArthur High

08:07.601 --> 08:10.302
so I called, but there's
no Michael Croft registered

08:10.302 --> 08:12.505
but the books are all bar coded.

08:12.505 --> 08:16.661
I'll take Radial Velocity with Jeffries
if Cragen will let her out of the office.

08:16.661 --> 08:19.217
- What?
- Morris Commission.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.774
Okay, what the hell's going on?

08:21.774 --> 08:23.726
- The psych evaluation?
- Yeah?

08:23.726 --> 08:26.938
I said I felt like killing child molesters.

08:26.938 --> 08:28.724
Okay, so how can they have
a problem with that?

08:28.724 --> 08:31.157
- The commissions are all cops.
- Yeah, well...

08:31.157 --> 08:34.110
when was the last time one of them
stood in a room like this?

08:36.784 --> 08:38.722
This belonged to Michael Croft?

08:38.722 --> 08:42.049
This is Michael Goren's book,
he's absent today.

08:42.049 --> 08:45.415
You want to speak to his
guidance counselor, Miss Scheider.

08:45.415 --> 08:47.002
Okay, thank you.

08:47.830 --> 08:51.083
I need a release from Michael's guardian
to give you his file.

08:51.083 --> 08:53.781
Mrs. Scheider, Michael's father
was murdered yesterday.

08:53.781 --> 08:55.575
Mr. Croft? / Yes.

08:55.575 --> 08:58.606
Mr. Croft wasn't Michael's father.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.200
- Foster parent?
- Guardian.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.714
You can see the problem
with getting his signature then.

09:02.714 --> 09:03.831
Right.

09:04.519 --> 09:05.774
This is terrible.

09:05.774 --> 09:07.780
- What happened to Michael's parents?
- I don't know.

09:07.780 --> 09:10.151
He was born in Belgium
that's all that's there.

09:10.151 --> 09:11.378
You have a current photo of him?

09:11.378 --> 09:13.167
No, Michael's a new student.

09:13.167 --> 09:15.502
We don't take school pictures
until homecoming.

09:15.502 --> 09:16.655
He's an AIB student.

09:16.655 --> 09:19.637
He could be a straight A student
if he made an effort.

09:19.637 --> 09:20.747
Why, is he lazy?

09:20.747 --> 09:21.894
Withdrawn.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.264
I feel like Michael's in some pain that
makes him gravitate to troublemakers.

09:25.264 --> 09:26.549
Yeah? Like who?

09:26.549 --> 09:28.887
Primarily, Jason Sloane.

09:29.485 --> 09:31.711
What's with the beach bum look?

09:31.885 --> 09:33.642
It's casual Monday.

09:33.872 --> 09:36.055
- Cops do that?
- Michael Goren.

09:36.055 --> 09:37.880
You know where he is?

09:38.641 --> 09:40.097
I don't know.

09:40.097 --> 09:41.701
When was the last time you saw Michael?

09:41.701 --> 09:43.194
Saturday. He stayed at my house.

09:43.194 --> 09:44.526
So you guys are close?

09:44.526 --> 09:47.493
No, but he hates going home to the creep,
and I've got an extra bed.

09:47.493 --> 09:48.883
What creep?

09:48.883 --> 09:50.385
Andrew.

09:51.352 --> 09:54.293
Andrew was shot yesterday,
he's dead.

09:54.293 --> 09:55.992
Excellent.

09:57.354 --> 10:00.372
Well, he was a bad guy.
I've seen him slap Michael around.

10:00.372 --> 10:02.609
So where's Michael now?

10:02.609 --> 10:04.209
Didn't I say I don't know?

10:04.209 --> 10:06.688
You don't know where he is,
but you're the only friend he's got?

10:06.688 --> 10:07.927
He has friends.

10:07.927 --> 10:10.894
Some girl calls him from wherever.

10:11.730 --> 10:14.573
- Wherever?
- Yeah. Wherever.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.518
I'd love to help you do your job,
but I'm a high school student.

10:20.327 --> 10:23.762
Radial Velocity, Inc.
173 Fifth Avenue Monday, September 11

10:24.873 --> 10:26.213
Thanks.

10:29.004 --> 10:31.749
Detectives.
I'm Craig Prince.

10:31.749 --> 10:34.154
I was Andrew Croft's supervisor.
This is Ralph Noble.

10:34.154 --> 10:38.150
- Security.
- It's a sad day for us.

10:38.318 --> 10:40.085
I wish I could say more. Anyway,

10:40.085 --> 10:43.656
this is everything from Croft's office
except what's classified.

10:43.656 --> 10:45.947
Was Mr. Croft's job classified?

10:45.947 --> 10:48.729
He was a guidance system analyst,
that's all I can say.

10:48.729 --> 10:50.074
He just transferred here.

10:50.074 --> 10:51.440
Can't be more specific.

10:51.440 --> 10:53.839
Who was to be notified
in case of an emergency?

10:53.839 --> 10:56.159
Detective, it's classified.

10:56.159 --> 10:58.040
Please, the man had a son.

10:58.040 --> 11:00.068
If something happens,
who looks out for him?

11:00.068 --> 11:01.613
That's not our concern.

11:01.613 --> 11:04.246
Do we have to get a court order?

11:04.958 --> 11:06.623
Well, you can try.

11:06.623 --> 11:11.629
What are the odds you have a picture
of Senator Joseph McCarthy tattooed
on your ass?

11:12.767 --> 11:15.932
Leave the dolly in the garage.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.280
Radial Velocity's redacted
1,200 pages of documents...

11:23.280 --> 11:25.134
down to the occasional adverb.

11:25.134 --> 11:27.448
There's not a complete sentence in
anything Craig Prince gave us.

11:27.448 --> 11:29.045
It is national security.

11:29.045 --> 11:30.155
We're looking for a murderer

11:30.155 --> 11:32.277
and the victim's missing kid
and Craig Prince is giving us:

11:32.277 --> 11:34.515
"Here's your hat, what's your hurry?"

11:34.515 --> 11:36.830
You'd think they'd want to help us
catch Croft's killer

11:36.830 --> 11:39.922
instead of burying everything under
the rubric of national security.

11:39.922 --> 11:42.862
It's too convenient,
there's something else going on here.

11:42.862 --> 11:47.009
It's Munch. No, I want to see
your spook ass now.

11:51.464 --> 11:52.773
What do you want, Munch?

11:52.773 --> 11:56.219
Anything I can get on a couple of
missile geeks from Radial Velocity.

11:56.219 --> 11:57.921
- Who?
- Craig Prince.

11:57.921 --> 11:59.392
He's no geek, he's a suit.

11:59.392 --> 12:01.201
Well, what's his story?

12:01.201 --> 12:03.092
- We've been looking at Prince.
- Why?

12:03.092 --> 12:05.730
Kickbacks. Guy's living way
beyond his paycheck.

12:05.730 --> 12:09.109
New co-op on Central Park West,
new A8 in the garage.

12:09.109 --> 12:12.042
He disperses classified money.

12:14.798 --> 12:16.505
Ralph Noble?

12:16.505 --> 12:18.313
Head of security.

12:19.805 --> 12:20.744
Yeah?

12:20.744 --> 12:23.155
Vietnam vet, Purple Heart...

12:23.155 --> 12:26.558
- Silver Star, Medal of Honor.
- Anything else?

12:26.558 --> 12:29.487
He was hoping for an Oscar,
but he's not in show business.

12:29.487 --> 12:30.957
Man's a war hero, Munch.

12:30.957 --> 12:32.911
Andrew Croft?

12:32.911 --> 12:34.500
Guidance systems.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.201
This guy's the king of the missile geeks

12:37.201 --> 12:38.567
but I got nothing.

12:38.567 --> 12:40.539
Croft's a black hole.

12:40.539 --> 12:42.277
Who does that?

12:42.277 --> 12:45.564
DOD, NSA.

12:45.564 --> 12:47.318
Why?

12:48.668 --> 12:51.255
We can fire a missile off a ship
in the Gulf of Oman.

12:51.255 --> 12:53.458
20 minutes and 600 miles later,

12:53.458 --> 12:57.452
it's entering the front door of a Hezbollah
safe house in Al Basrah,

12:57.452 --> 13:00.394
doesn't even touch the doorframe.

13:00.794 --> 13:03.060
Anybody can build a bomb, Munch,

13:03.060 --> 13:05.428
but nobody delivers them like we do.

13:05.428 --> 13:07.115
Guidance systems, John.

13:07.115 --> 13:09.083
What are we willing to pay for them?

13:09.083 --> 13:10.466
Anything.

13:10.466 --> 13:13.350
Erase your enemies, erase your past.

13:13.350 --> 13:17.181
Like I said, Croft's a black hole.

13:18.002 --> 13:20.971
- Why the interest?
- Croft's dead.

13:20.971 --> 13:23.321
Michael, his 16-year-old ward is missing.

13:23.321 --> 13:26.441
Prince and Noble aren't talking.

13:27.205 --> 13:28.902
How'd Croft buy it?

13:28.902 --> 13:31.811
Bullet to the head, Bunsen to the crotch.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.252
Ouch. / Yeah.

13:49.217 --> 13:50.475
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

13:50.475 --> 13:52.271
The fire.

13:52.802 --> 13:55.617
- Come here.
- The fire, Daddy, the fire.

13:55.617 --> 13:59.338
It's okay, it's all right.

14:05.387 --> 14:07.991
Look, the recidivism rate for rapists and
child molesters

14:07.991 --> 14:10.483
is far more onerous
than that of murderers.

14:10.483 --> 14:11.894
The public knows that.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.439
The public cares about victims' rights.

14:14.439 --> 14:19.080
And live victims give better sound bites
than dead ones.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.164
They vote, too.

14:21.363 --> 14:22.818
I don't.

14:22.818 --> 14:26.882
I used to, but, well, look at the choices.

14:26.882 --> 14:29.642
I don't much care for
city politics these days.

14:29.642 --> 14:33.189
The mollifying, the scapegoating.

14:33.189 --> 14:35.005
That's why there's a Morris Commission.

14:35.005 --> 14:36.602
That's why you're at SVU.

14:36.602 --> 14:40.488
I gotta tell you something, Alex.

14:40.488 --> 14:44.016
I really don't see why I should trust you.

14:44.974 --> 14:46.262
Captain.

14:47.390 --> 14:52.309
I intend to stand on your shoulders
to reach a broader Constituency.

14:52.309 --> 14:55.920
Why would I do anything
to shorten my grasp?

14:57.346 --> 14:58.812
Okay.

14:59.314 --> 15:03.105
Maybe this could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

15:03.105 --> 15:05.235
Our open cases.

15:05.235 --> 15:06.413
According to the M.E.,

15:06.413 --> 15:10.880
Andrew Croft was killed by a.38 slug,
behind the left ear, point-blank.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.760
- Burning was post mortem.
- You got a weapon?

15:12.760 --> 15:16.247
It hasn't turned up yet,
but Croft owned a.38.

15:16.247 --> 15:17.241
What about the boy?

15:17.241 --> 15:19.835
Still missing, along with Croft's Lexus.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.366
Maybe the kid is dead.

15:21.366 --> 15:22.926
Why do you say that?

15:22.926 --> 15:25.526
My contact at the G says
that Croft's supervisor,

15:25.526 --> 15:28.819
Craig Prince is being looked
at for kickbacks. / So what?

15:28.819 --> 15:30.480
Well, maybe Croft had evidence,

15:30.480 --> 15:33.192
maybe Croft was involved
and they had a lethal disagreement.

15:33.192 --> 15:35.779
Looks like sexual homicide
not an assassination.

15:35.779 --> 15:39.128
- Very clever, to throw us off track.
- I gotta hand it to you.

15:39.128 --> 15:41.074
When you go with a theory,
you really go with a theory.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.683
- You think this stuff doesn't happen?
- No, I'm not saying...

15:43.683 --> 15:46.331
Let's just keep our heads
in the game here, all right?

15:46.331 --> 15:50.150
Now the connection between
Prince and Croft warrants further investigation.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.512
But in the meantime,
we've still got a missing kid

15:52.512 --> 15:57.302
and until I know otherwise,
I'm going to assume he's still alive.

15:57.302 --> 15:59.673
Now you guys, find the Lexus,
find the boy.

15:59.673 --> 16:03.667
Munch, Jeffries, let's find out
how good this new ADA really is.

16:03.667 --> 16:06.801
We need a search warrant for
Radial Velocity.

16:08.431 --> 16:09.918
You want me to secure a search warrant

16:09.918 --> 16:13.698
for the offices of a defense contractor
to search classified national security files

16:13.698 --> 16:15.603
for evidence in a sexually
motivated homicide?

16:15.603 --> 16:17.705
Yes, you got a problem with that?

16:17.705 --> 16:19.312
Judge Harriman, please.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.841
This is Alex Cabot in the DA's office.

16:23.474 --> 16:25.589
Uncle Bill? Good.

16:25.589 --> 16:27.413
Look, I need a little favor.

16:28.952 --> 16:30.698
You've got to be kidding me.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.802
You said we should try.

16:33.750 --> 16:37.879
You do not just barge in here
without proper notice.

16:37.879 --> 16:39.003
Read the fine print.

16:39.003 --> 16:42.587
Now step aside, or I'll have
these officers restrain you.

16:45.534 --> 16:48.522
Special Victims Unit Squadroom
Tuesday, September 12

16:48.522 --> 16:50.997
Great, thank you.
That was the state police.

16:50.997 --> 16:55.204
We've located Croft's Lexus
upstate Millbrook, right outside Poughkeepsie.

16:55.204 --> 16:56.702
Croft transferred from Poughkeepsie.

16:56.702 --> 16:58.434
Locals are surveilling it till we get there.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.029
Great. Find something.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.830
Blood. Pop it.

17:10.349 --> 17:12.180
Nobody home.

17:12.180 --> 17:14.910
House belongs to Richard
and Darlene Sadler.

17:14.910 --> 17:17.332
They own a hardware store over
on Elm street.

17:17.332 --> 17:19.939
Their daughter, Denise,
attends the high school.

17:19.939 --> 17:23.400
Well, looks like we found the girlfriend
from wherever.

17:30.530 --> 17:33.973
Adams High School
Millbrook Township, NY
Tuesday, September 12

17:34.163 --> 17:36.003
Slow down!

17:36.003 --> 17:38.048
Denise is in her fourth period class.

17:38.048 --> 17:40.802
We were hoping that she might be able to
help us locate Michael Goren.

17:40.802 --> 17:43.077
Leave the spurs home next time.

17:43.077 --> 17:45.486
Great kid Michael.
What do you mean locate?

17:45.486 --> 17:47.562
He's been missing since Sunday.

17:47.562 --> 17:49.514
Michael's not missing.

17:49.728 --> 17:52.478
He's in our mentoring program.

17:55.614 --> 17:57.648
Let's go, Jimmy. Nice Job.

17:57.648 --> 17:59.875
Good job. All right, everybody
just like Jimmy,

17:59.875 --> 18:02.243
- use the inside of your foot.
- Michael.

18:07.241 --> 18:10.116
This is about Andrew, isn't it?

18:14.954 --> 18:17.386
- Do you understand these rights?
- Yes.

18:17.386 --> 18:21.059
Do you understand that you don't
have to talk to us without your lawyer?

18:21.059 --> 18:22.956
I wanna talk.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.537
Go ahead.

18:28.410 --> 18:30.574
I killed him.

18:32.283 --> 18:35.385
He hit me, I hit him back.

18:36.042 --> 18:38.260
First time I did that,

18:38.260 --> 18:42.032
he went crazy got his gun,
said he was gonna kill me.

18:42.032 --> 18:46.047
I tackled him and then
I heard this loud pop.

18:46.047 --> 18:49.782
When I looked down,
he was laying there...

18:51.474 --> 18:53.370
dead.

18:57.702 --> 18:59.820
Then what?

19:00.003 --> 19:05.324
I wrapped him in the sheets
and dragged him to the car.

19:05.516 --> 19:09.098
The next thing I knew
I was driving back home.

19:09.098 --> 19:11.170
To Millbrook?

19:11.515 --> 19:13.267
Yes.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.549
Michael, what's going on?

19:20.549 --> 19:21.717
It's nothing.

19:23.267 --> 19:24.662
I'm okay, Denise. It's okay.

19:24.662 --> 19:25.733
This can't be right.

19:25.733 --> 19:26.665
Step back... / Not Michael.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.404
Step back, people.

19:28.404 --> 19:30.674
Give us a little room please.

19:30.858 --> 19:33.965
Michael, we're all behind you on this.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.351
Give us a little room, please.

19:42.717 --> 19:44.172
What are you doing?

19:44.172 --> 19:45.998
They got a confession, made an arrest.

19:45.998 --> 19:48.175
That can all go back to Radial Velocity.

19:48.175 --> 19:49.230
Too tidy.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.272
Can't stand letting go of a theory, can you?

19:51.272 --> 19:53.066
It's not theory, Olivia.

19:53.066 --> 19:55.323
Confession, next case.
I don't buy it.

19:55.323 --> 19:57.156
Heat of the moment murder is one thing

19:57.156 --> 19:59.637
but taking time to set fire
to the victim's crotch.

19:59.637 --> 20:00.852
What'd you call that, Elliot?

20:00.852 --> 20:02.805
Sexually motivated homicide.

20:02.805 --> 20:05.271
You bet. Perpetrated by a child
on a guardian.

20:05.271 --> 20:07.443
Text book except for the little matter
of the blank pages,

20:07.443 --> 20:08.844
thanks to Radial Velocity.

20:08.844 --> 20:10.976
I want to know where
they stand on this deal.

20:10.976 --> 20:12.916
Me, too.

20:12.916 --> 20:13.895
You have an appointment.

20:13.895 --> 20:16.712
Look, Captain, you know,
this time of day, Skodas' office

20:16.712 --> 20:20.553
- it's gotta be an hour drive.
- Elliot, this is must do, now.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.695
The good news

20:21.695 --> 20:25.114
is that he's around the corner
doing some outreach work at Christ's Church.

20:25.114 --> 20:28.063
He's happy to see you now.
Thank you.

20:29.716 --> 20:32.120
I'm not talking to you.

20:32.944 --> 20:34.625
Fine.

20:35.104 --> 20:36.780
I'll just sit here.

20:36.780 --> 20:40.809
You know, I may lose my job
because of the last shrink I talked to.

20:40.809 --> 20:41.614
Why?

20:41.614 --> 20:46.304
Because she violated her ethical obligation
to keep my confidence.

20:46.304 --> 20:49.950
If we believe a patient might do violence
to someone, we're legally bound to...

20:49.950 --> 20:53.617
I have never done violence to anyone.

20:54.739 --> 20:57.401
Why would she think you would?

20:57.875 --> 20:59.681
Ask her.

20:59.681 --> 21:02.975
Det. Stabler, we've talked before.

21:02.975 --> 21:06.383
Come on, give me the benefit
of the doubt, will you?

21:08.295 --> 21:11.726
I'm sorry, I haven't slept a lot lately.

21:11.726 --> 21:13.054
Why not?

21:13.054 --> 21:16.004
I'm worried about losing my job.

21:17.901 --> 21:19.353
I'm angry.

21:19.353 --> 21:21.143
At?

21:24.416 --> 21:26.442
Are we really gonna do this dance again?

21:26.442 --> 21:30.253
I mean, what do you want me to say?
That I fantasized about killing the perp?

21:30.253 --> 21:32.502
- Did you?
- Yeah, you're damn right I did

21:32.502 --> 21:36.102
and this time I fed him my gun
and I pulled that trigger.

21:36.102 --> 21:39.348
Until I caught him and
then there he is, he's just...

21:39.348 --> 21:44.598
He's a kid, he's a good kid.
He tutors Down syndrome children.

21:44.598 --> 21:47.734
He's a straight A student,
he's a star athlete...

21:47.734 --> 21:51.093
he's Millbrook township's favorite son.

21:52.474 --> 21:57.400
Now how that jives with
cold-blooded murder...

21:59.172 --> 22:02.407
How long have you been on the force?

22:02.407 --> 22:04.856
14 years.

22:05.018 --> 22:10.250
In all those years, how many murders
have actually made sense?

22:10.250 --> 22:12.752
None. But...

22:14.531 --> 22:16.471
some I understood.

22:16.471 --> 22:17.980
But this one...

22:17.980 --> 22:21.620
you let get under your skin. Why?

22:25.005 --> 22:27.966
This one, my daughter saw.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.808
Hey, how'd it go?

22:33.808 --> 22:37.170
I talked too much, again.
Where's Jeffries?

22:37.170 --> 22:38.559
Her turn on the couch,

22:38.559 --> 22:41.003
and while you were probing your inner child
we did some probing of our own.

22:41.003 --> 22:44.007
Sent Croft's prints to NCIC.

22:44.007 --> 22:45.629
You printed the corpse?

22:45.629 --> 22:46.771
So?

22:46.771 --> 22:48.105
- And?
- Nothing.

22:48.105 --> 22:50.312
So? / I mean nothing, nada, bupkis.

22:50.312 --> 22:52.601
Zip. No parking tickets, no birth records.

22:52.601 --> 22:55.299
Nothing to prove he even existed
before 1991.

22:55.299 --> 22:57.651
The year he went to work for Radial Velocity.

22:57.651 --> 22:59.517
So, we're going through the stuff
we got from the search warrant

22:59.517 --> 23:02.272
we find this passport issued 10 years ago
from San Diego.

23:02.272 --> 23:04.648
We call the local PD,
ask them to run him,

23:04.648 --> 23:07.481
- bang, we get a hit.
- But not to Andrew Croft.

23:07.481 --> 23:08.187
Then who?

23:08.187 --> 23:11.574
George Kazinski,
a convicted sexual predator.

23:11.574 --> 23:15.548
Andrew Croft, a.k. A George Kazinski.

23:15.548 --> 23:18.510
Little George liked little boys.

23:24.832 --> 23:27.206
Andrew Croft's been one busy guy.

23:27.206 --> 23:30.531
11 arrests, five aliases, four convictions.

23:30.531 --> 23:31.358
How'd you track him?

23:31.358 --> 23:33.900
San Diego PD faxed us his rap sheet.

23:33.900 --> 23:35.225
We followed his priors back from there

23:35.225 --> 23:38.340
department by department,
conviction by conviction.

23:38.340 --> 23:41.679
- Only the feds can erase a file.
- Radial Velocity is the feds.

23:41.679 --> 23:44.827
That's why they're called
a military-industrial complex.

23:44.827 --> 23:48.593
You're accusing the Federal government
of sanctioning the sexual abuse of a child.

23:48.593 --> 23:51.418
Please tell me you have a motive.

23:53.035 --> 23:54.312
Where did you find these?

23:54.312 --> 23:56.573
That's classified.

23:57.228 --> 24:00.691
There's only a handful of people that
can calibrate the trajectory of a missile

24:00.691 --> 24:03.470
to within a hair's breadth
of Saddam's mustache.

24:03.470 --> 24:05.852
Andrew Croft was one of them.

24:05.852 --> 24:10.604
Couldn't let a little thing like pedophilia
undermine national security.

24:10.604 --> 24:12.650
If a child is ruined in the process?

24:12.650 --> 24:15.293
- That's not our concern.
- Detective...

24:15.293 --> 24:19.700
there are many things that take a back
seat to national security. However...

24:19.700 --> 24:22.950
if I had known Croft was a pedophile,
I never would have hired him.

24:22.950 --> 24:26.292
Right, and there were no Nazis in NASA.

24:26.292 --> 24:28.504
Mr. Noble will see you out.

24:30.291 --> 24:31.953
You don't talk much, do you?

24:31.953 --> 24:33.915
Not much fight left in the old soldier?

24:33.915 --> 24:35.662
Don't you question my patriotism, mister.

24:35.662 --> 24:37.788
That's Mister Detective to you.

24:37.788 --> 24:40.195
Take a little bit of tarnish off
that Medal of Honor.

24:40.195 --> 24:43.691
We can find our own way out, thanks.

24:48.089 --> 24:49.966
Why're you provoking him?

24:49.966 --> 24:52.958
Guy's a war hero.
Put his life on the line for principle.

24:52.958 --> 24:56.778
He's gotta be gagging stonewalling Croft's
pedophilia to protect Radial Velocity.

24:56.778 --> 25:00.401
Assuming he still has principles.
War was a long time ago, John.

25:00.401 --> 25:01.841
Principles die harder than people.

25:01.841 --> 25:04.661
I want a shot at what's left of his.

25:06.473 --> 25:08.775
Wonder what he's doing for lunch?

25:10.113 --> 25:12.365
Rikers Island Interview Room
Wednesday, September 13

25:12.365 --> 25:14.602
My parents died in a car wreck
when I was eight.

25:14.602 --> 25:17.044
The only other family I had was Nana.

25:17.044 --> 25:19.888
She was old and in a hospital.

25:19.888 --> 25:22.033
Andrew offered to take care of me.

25:22.033 --> 25:26.094
You're Belgian and Andrew's American.
How did you two hook up?

25:26.094 --> 25:28.548
Andrew used to hang out at soccer practice.

25:28.548 --> 25:30.737
- Whose soccer practice?
- Mine.

25:30.737 --> 25:33.199
- And this is when you were 8 years old?
- Yeah.

25:33.199 --> 25:36.046
He and Dad worked at NATO in Brussels.

25:36.046 --> 25:38.411
Dad was a janitor.

25:38.574 --> 25:41.683
He was proud to have
a rocket scientist as his friend.

25:41.683 --> 25:45.736
Said I was lucky to have such
an important man take an interest in me.

25:45.736 --> 25:47.639
How did he take an interest?

25:47.639 --> 25:49.360
Andrew said I was a natural athlete.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.130
Yeah, we saw your trophies.

25:51.130 --> 25:54.394
He got me sailing lessons,
tennis lessons...

25:54.394 --> 25:57.005
My dad couldn't afford them.

25:57.436 --> 26:00.803
After your parents died,
Andrew brought you to America?

26:00.803 --> 26:05.132
First Bosnia, Israel, then Millbrook.

26:05.132 --> 26:06.703
I finally made some friends.

26:06.703 --> 26:09.029
Yeah, you even had a girlfriend.

26:09.029 --> 26:10.121
Denise.

26:10.121 --> 26:12.459
Bet you weren't too happy
about leaving her.

26:12.459 --> 26:14.950
I never felt like that about anybody.

26:14.950 --> 26:18.332
I mean, not just her, her parents...

26:18.527 --> 26:21.718
They felt like a real family.

26:23.188 --> 26:25.541
Michael, did you know that in 1990

26:25.541 --> 26:30.854
Andrew was convicted of sexually
assaulting an 11 year-old boy?

26:30.854 --> 26:32.614
No.

26:34.368 --> 26:38.041
When was the first time
he assaulted you?

26:38.041 --> 26:41.067
He didn't.
What are you talking about?

26:41.067 --> 26:44.437
Well, in my experience,
child molesters, they don't stop.

26:44.437 --> 26:45.999
You were a child.

26:45.999 --> 26:47.217
He didn't touch me!

26:47.217 --> 26:49.533
Michael, you were in a bad situation.

26:49.533 --> 26:51.388
You're safe now.
You don't have to lie anymore.

26:51.388 --> 26:52.548
I'm not lying! / Michael.

26:52.548 --> 26:54.054
I'm not!

26:57.187 --> 26:59.898
He didn't touch me.

27:00.866 --> 27:03.034
He didn't.

27:03.290 --> 27:05.134
Thanks for the heads up.

27:05.134 --> 27:06.908
I think I've got the EED defense.

27:06.908 --> 27:09.695
Not unless your client changes his tune.

27:09.695 --> 27:11.014
Are we working for the defense now?

27:11.014 --> 27:14.438
Yeah. You don't volunteer to do hard time
because you're embarrassed.

27:14.438 --> 27:16.598
This kid is hiding something.

27:16.598 --> 27:18.180
Okay, maybe an accomplice.

27:18.180 --> 27:21.168
Maybe somebody who scares
him more than Andrew.

27:24.418 --> 27:27.597
At what point did courage and
integrity buckle to income?

27:27.597 --> 27:29.127
Don't ever get in my face about money.

27:29.127 --> 27:31.047
If I cared about money
I wouldn't have been in the service.

27:31.047 --> 27:32.458
What do you care about?

27:32.458 --> 27:36.529
Protecting the reputation of a dead
pedophile part of national security now?

27:36.529 --> 27:38.720
I'm not protecting Croft's reputation.

27:38.720 --> 27:41.002
What are you protecting?

27:41.631 --> 27:44.904
Croft's missile guidance expertise
was critical in the Gulf War.

27:44.904 --> 27:47.477
You erase sodomy convictions
for national security?

27:47.477 --> 27:50.110
We didn't erase his convictions.

27:50.551 --> 27:53.243
What? Is there another way to say it?

27:53.517 --> 27:58.060
Croft's felony record red-flagged him
every time he crossed a border.

27:58.060 --> 28:00.688
A day's delay was a lifetime
in a war moving that fast.

28:00.688 --> 28:03.853
So Radial Velocity erased his past.

28:04.082 --> 28:08.281
We were depleting our arsenal of
smart bombs at more than
$1 million a minute.

28:08.281 --> 28:11.796
At that price the Pentagon wanted
pin-point precision.

28:11.796 --> 28:14.168
A complaint was filed
in the State department.

28:14.168 --> 28:17.863
A firewall was built around Croft
so lmmigration wouldn't red-flag him.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.273
When the war ended the wall
should've come down.

28:20.273 --> 28:22.768
I can't tell you why it didn't,
I just don't know!

28:22.768 --> 28:24.937
Meanwhile, a convicted child molester

28:24.937 --> 28:28.593
applies for guardianship
of an 8-year-old and...

28:28.593 --> 28:32.907
No red flags.
I'm sorry.

28:39.913 --> 28:40.857
My God!

28:40.857 --> 28:44.475
Eleven arrests, four convictions
more than we knew about, one in Canada.

28:44.475 --> 28:47.801
This is despicable.
Get me Todd Earl at Justice.

28:47.801 --> 28:48.980
Justice?

28:48.980 --> 28:50.395
We need to secure the chain of evidence.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.823
We didn't bring this to you
so you could make a federal case.

28:52.823 --> 28:54.374
- What about Michael?
- What about him?

28:54.374 --> 28:55.537
He's a child.

28:55.537 --> 28:58.286
A child raised
by a pedophile for eight years.

28:58.286 --> 29:00.231
- He was molested.
- He denies it.

29:00.231 --> 29:02.645
There's no evidence here
to contradict that denial.

29:02.645 --> 29:04.328
Are you saying he wasn't abused?

29:04.328 --> 29:05.732
I'm certain he was.

29:05.732 --> 29:07.068
However, absent Michael's admission

29:07.068 --> 29:09.560
you're asking me to soft-pedal
premeditated murder.

29:09.560 --> 29:12.211
- You're protecting your won-loss ratio.
- Elliot.

29:12.211 --> 29:13.541
It's okay, Captain.

29:13.541 --> 29:17.573
Stabler's judgment is clouded by the stress
of the Morris Commission's review.

29:17.573 --> 29:22.759
And the fact that Michael did what
he fantasizes about. Kill a perpetrator.

29:23.452 --> 29:28.417
It's not my fantasy,
and I stand with Det. Stabler on this.

29:29.157 --> 29:30.962
The kid had choices.

29:30.962 --> 29:33.897
He could have walked away,
told a teacher, told a cop.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.743
Instead he murdered.

29:35.743 --> 29:37.571
We let him skate on this
what kind of choice will

29:37.571 --> 29:41.888
he make the next time
he faces an untenable situation?

29:45.204 --> 29:48.645
All right, but either
he corroborates the abuse

29:48.645 --> 29:53.082
or I ask the grand jury for
an indictment on murder two.

29:56.326 --> 29:57.375
No.

29:57.375 --> 29:59.546
Michael, please... / No.

29:59.961 --> 30:01.612
Michael...

30:02.046 --> 30:06.531
Andrew Croft abused
at least 11 other children.

30:06.531 --> 30:09.622
He's a sexual predator.

30:09.914 --> 30:11.496
Michael, he can't hurt you now.

30:11.496 --> 30:13.614
You don't understand.

30:14.049 --> 30:17.486
I won't. I can't.

30:17.665 --> 30:19.398
- You're a victim.
- No, I'm not!

30:19.398 --> 30:22.439
I'm not! I told you what happened.
I will stay in jail!

30:22.439 --> 30:28.271
I will, but, please, leave me alone.

30:31.883 --> 30:36.183
It's murder two.
He's returning his own indictment.

30:36.362 --> 30:38.489
Sorry, Captain.

30:55.984 --> 30:57.208
Dad?

30:58.098 --> 30:59.692
What are you doing up?

30:59.692 --> 31:01.324
Couldn't sleep.

31:01.324 --> 31:03.550
What's the matter?
You got nightmares?

31:03.550 --> 31:05.222
You have to sleep to have nightmares.

31:05.222 --> 31:07.618
Right, what was I thinking?

31:07.618 --> 31:09.926
- Want something to drink?
- No.

31:12.646 --> 31:14.153
Dad...

31:14.999 --> 31:18.763
what that boy Michael did to that man...

31:19.353 --> 31:23.178
That man was supposed to
take care of Michael

31:23.178 --> 31:27.623
and instead he molested him.

31:27.623 --> 31:32.202
He abused him physically,
he betrayed his trust, and I think Michael...

31:32.202 --> 31:34.945
just had enough.

31:34.945 --> 31:38.874
- So what happens now?
- He's probably gonna go to prison.

31:39.351 --> 31:42.252
All he's gotta do is tell the truth.

31:42.252 --> 31:44.386
What is it with you kids?

31:44.386 --> 31:47.039
It's hard to talk to adults.

31:47.039 --> 31:48.700
Why?

31:48.905 --> 31:50.946
You're always judging us.

31:50.946 --> 31:52.730
You expect us to be like you

31:52.730 --> 31:54.493
and you get mad if we're not.

31:54.493 --> 31:56.618
It's just easier to talk to our friends.

31:56.618 --> 31:58.209
What if you don't have any friends?

31:58.209 --> 32:01.314
- Everybody's got friends.
- Yeah? Well, who do you talk to?

32:01.314 --> 32:03.015
Dad.

32:03.579 --> 32:05.510
You talk to Ryan Witherspoon?

32:05.510 --> 32:08.513
More than you talk to Mom.

32:13.065 --> 32:15.374
Grand Jury Room
Thursday, September 14

32:15.374 --> 32:18.072
Could the wound have been inflicted
during a struggle for the gun?

32:18.072 --> 32:20.316
- Not likely.
- Why not?

32:20.316 --> 32:24.279
The size of the entry wound the force
at which it entered suggests close range.

32:24.279 --> 32:25.550
But there was no stippling.

32:25.550 --> 32:27.165
Stippling is?

32:27.165 --> 32:28.736
When lead leaves the muzzle,

32:28.736 --> 32:31.627
it's followed by the charge that fires it,
the gunpowder.

32:31.627 --> 32:35.670
At close range it leaves a residue,
point blank it embeds in the skin.

32:35.670 --> 32:37.046
That's stippling.

32:37.046 --> 32:38.458
The size and force of the entry

32:38.458 --> 32:41.152
and the lack of stippling lead you
to conclude?

32:41.152 --> 32:44.852
The gun was three to four feet from
the victim's head when it was fired.

32:44.852 --> 32:46.856
The victim's reach was only 32 inches.

32:46.856 --> 32:49.440
He couldn't have held the gun
three feet from his skull,

32:49.440 --> 32:52.517
much less fired it
into the back of his head.

32:52.517 --> 32:54.810
The body was discovered
wrapped in a sheet.

32:54.810 --> 32:59.233
It was blood-soaked from a head wound
and the genital region was on fire.

32:59.233 --> 33:00.454
Where?

33:00.454 --> 33:03.776
In the dunes about 50 yards off
Cross Bay Boulevard

33:03.776 --> 33:08.195
a medical bracelet on the victim indicated
he lived at West 83rd in Manhattan.

33:08.195 --> 33:12.712
Blood splattered the headboard, wall,
and lamp in the master bedroom.

33:12.712 --> 33:15.217
Did the blood pattern indicate
anything to you?

33:15.217 --> 33:18.542
Yes, that the victim had been shot
while lying in the bed.

33:18.542 --> 33:20.296
Any signs of a struggle?

33:20.296 --> 33:22.707
No. / Forced entry?

33:22.707 --> 33:24.107
No.

33:24.726 --> 33:27.055
The victim's car was missing?

33:27.055 --> 33:30.336
State police located it in Millbrook,
New York.

33:30.336 --> 33:33.479
The murder weapon was found
locked in the trunk.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.749
Who had the keys?

33:37.043 --> 33:39.338
Michael Goren.

33:43.619 --> 33:46.744
- How'd it go in there?
- The kid's toast.

33:46.744 --> 33:50.996
I've been thinking about something
Maureen said last night,
something about friends.

33:50.996 --> 33:52.750
What about them?

33:52.750 --> 33:55.155
You up for taking a little ride?

33:55.883 --> 33:57.771
Adams High School
Millbrook Township, NY
Thursday, September 14

33:57.771 --> 34:00.580
Denise, how long were you
seeing Michael?

34:01.879 --> 34:03.935
What should I say?
I really want to help him.

34:03.935 --> 34:07.050
You can help him by telling us the truth.

34:07.235 --> 34:09.280
We were dating about three months.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.639
He ever talk about Andrew?

34:13.025 --> 34:15.043
Denise?

34:15.605 --> 34:17.616
Did he? / Please.

34:18.938 --> 34:21.634
They didn't get along.

34:22.091 --> 34:24.158
My dad would let Michael stay
in our spare bedroom

34:24.158 --> 34:26.145
when Andrew was out of town.

34:26.145 --> 34:28.791
My parents really liked him.

34:30.475 --> 34:35.313
Sometimes Michael lied about Andrew
being gone, so he could stay over.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.529
Did Andrew ever find out?

34:37.529 --> 34:40.297
- I think he knew.
- He object?

34:41.378 --> 34:43.887
Not after that thing with Danny.

34:43.887 --> 34:45.730
Who's Danny?

34:45.730 --> 34:48.114
Danny Burrell. Michael's best friend.

34:48.114 --> 34:50.734
- What happened?
- I don't know.

34:50.938 --> 34:52.637
But it had to be bad.

34:52.637 --> 34:55.061
I mean, one day they're best friends

34:55.061 --> 34:58.350
and the next day,
it's like they hate each other.

34:59.107 --> 35:01.503
Heads up, Mueller!
Heads up!

35:01.503 --> 35:03.177
Danny Burrell!

35:03.436 --> 35:04.527
Yeah?

35:04.527 --> 35:06.672
Front and center.

35:08.279 --> 35:10.983
We're not friends anymore.

35:10.983 --> 35:12.456
Why not?

35:12.456 --> 35:13.809
Guy's weird, that's all.

35:13.809 --> 35:15.738
What do you mean?
Weird, how?

35:15.738 --> 35:17.153
Just weird.

35:17.153 --> 35:19.493
Did Andrew Croft attack you?

35:20.847 --> 35:23.732
- Did Michael tell you that?
- Why don't you tell us about it?

35:24.193 --> 35:26.140
Man, he swore!

35:28.505 --> 35:31.011
I'm sorry I can't talk in front of her.

35:31.011 --> 35:32.508
That's okay.

35:35.816 --> 35:38.088
- Mike and me played ball.
- Okay.

35:38.088 --> 35:41.741
We went to his house
afterwards to clean up.

35:41.741 --> 35:46.211
He said that Andrew was gone,
so I used his shower, and when I got out...

35:46.211 --> 35:48.554
- he was standing there.
- Andrew?

35:48.808 --> 35:50.188
Yeah.

35:50.472 --> 35:52.466
He was naked.

35:53.246 --> 35:57.062
He was touching himself.

35:57.062 --> 35:59.917
He wanted to dry me off.

35:59.917 --> 36:01.876
He's just a creep.

36:02.158 --> 36:06.668
Anyway, he said that Michael was
too swarthy but I was perfect for him.

36:06.668 --> 36:11.077
He grabbed me, I fought him off,
I screamed for Mike...

36:11.077 --> 36:14.088
and I finally got the door open,
and Michael was...

36:14.088 --> 36:16.214
He was just standing there.

36:16.214 --> 36:19.383
So, I just grabbed my clothes and I ran.

36:19.383 --> 36:21.755
I forgot my Nikes.

36:22.128 --> 36:23.803
You and Michael talk after that?

36:23.803 --> 36:27.697
No way. I told the guy to leave me alone.

36:27.697 --> 36:29.523
I think it's disgusting what he
and Andrew were doing.

36:29.523 --> 36:31.557
You think Michael liked it?

36:32.513 --> 36:33.531
What do you think?

36:33.531 --> 36:36.859
I mean, Michael's 6 foot,
guy benches, what, 220 pounds?

36:36.859 --> 36:39.441
He could kick his ass
if he didn't like him doing him.

36:39.441 --> 36:43.134
He was eight years old
when Andrew started doing him.

36:43.134 --> 36:45.438
Eight-year-olds can't fight back.

36:45.438 --> 36:47.079
Now you tell me where
a 16 year-old's gonna turn

36:47.079 --> 36:50.033
when his best friend turns on him?

36:55.480 --> 36:58.223
Grand Jury Room
Monday, September 18

36:58.223 --> 37:00.767
You said the gun went off
in the midst of a struggle?

37:00.767 --> 37:01.840
Yes.

37:01.840 --> 37:05.780
The police found no signs of a struggle.
How do you explain that?

37:06.035 --> 37:07.438
I don't know.

37:07.438 --> 37:10.285
That's because there was no struggle,
was there?

37:10.285 --> 37:11.673
We struggled.

37:11.673 --> 37:12.629
Over the gun?

37:12.629 --> 37:14.202
Yes. / And it went off?

37:14.202 --> 37:16.121
Yes. / In both your hands?

37:16.121 --> 37:17.468
Yes.

37:17.682 --> 37:21.224
The Coroner found no trace of gunpowder
on the deceased's hands.

37:21.224 --> 37:23.884
I told you what happened.

37:25.530 --> 37:27.902
Who is Danny Burrell?

37:33.489 --> 37:35.351
He's my friend.

37:35.351 --> 37:39.245
Did you witness the deceased
sexually assault Danny Burrell?

37:39.245 --> 37:40.960
No!

37:42.755 --> 37:48.030
Danny will testify the deceased sexually
assaulted him and that you witnessed it.

37:48.030 --> 37:51.047
Are you saying he's lying?

37:53.269 --> 37:58.716
Did Andrew Croft sexually assault
Danny Burrell?

38:02.271 --> 38:04.301
Yes.

38:05.222 --> 38:08.086
And you, too?

38:17.069 --> 38:20.279
Since I was eight.

38:20.732 --> 38:23.459
You shot him to stop him
from molesting you?

38:23.459 --> 38:24.989
No!

38:26.258 --> 38:30.708
I hated it, but I was used to it.

38:30.708 --> 38:35.320
I shot him because he was
bringing over his friend.

38:35.779 --> 38:38.208
What friend?

38:40.809 --> 38:46.465
In Millbrook,
this guy came up sometimes.

38:47.369 --> 38:50.174
Andrew made me do things with him.

38:50.174 --> 38:53.091
When we moved here,
I thought it was over.

38:53.091 --> 38:56.252
But then I come home from school
and he's there!

38:56.252 --> 39:00.535
I mean we moved right
across the street from him!

39:02.530 --> 39:06.995
Andrew was bad enough,
but both of them...

39:06.995 --> 39:09.560
I begged him.

39:16.845 --> 39:20.033
Who is this man?

39:24.420 --> 39:25.670
He'll kill me.

39:25.670 --> 39:27.708
He can't hurt you.

39:27.906 --> 39:30.444
You don't know his powers.

39:30.444 --> 39:32.556
Michael, you're in the custody of the
City of New York.

39:32.556 --> 39:34.328
He can't get to you.

39:34.328 --> 39:37.037
He can get to anybody.

39:37.529 --> 39:40.310
And he will to protect his secret.

39:40.310 --> 39:43.946
A child molester only has power
as long as his secret is kept.

39:43.946 --> 39:46.350
You tell the truth, his power is gone.

39:46.350 --> 39:48.253
What's his name, Michael?

39:48.253 --> 39:51.396
I heard them talk about it.
Nobody did anything.

39:51.396 --> 39:55.467
Talk about what?
Who, Michael?

39:59.027 --> 40:01.564
Andrew and...

40:03.714 --> 40:06.680
and Craig Prince.

40:06.877 --> 40:12.175
They killed that boy in Belgium
and nobody did anything!

40:12.175 --> 40:14.439
When did this happen?
What boy?

40:14.439 --> 40:18.222
I was eight.
It was in the papers there.

40:18.222 --> 40:20.882
Nobody did anything.

40:20.882 --> 40:26.164
Craig Prince can get away with anything.

40:28.632 --> 40:31.637
You're gonna protect me?

40:33.796 --> 40:37.862
Write-offs in the third quarter adjusted
by the...

40:37.862 --> 40:39.251
Craig, good news!

40:39.251 --> 40:41.724
Excuse me, this is a classified briefing.

40:41.724 --> 40:44.445
Yeah, Croft's ward, Michael.

40:44.445 --> 40:47.802
The grand jury voted man two.
DA's willing to cut him a deal.

40:47.802 --> 40:48.877
I don't see what that has to do...

40:48.877 --> 40:52.172
Even better news, you're under arrest
for sexual abuse, sodomy,

40:52.172 --> 40:54.519
assault and endangering
the welfare of a child.

40:54.519 --> 40:57.163
- You're hurting me!
- Not our concern.

40:57.163 --> 40:59.598
Craig Prince, you have the right
to remain silent.

40:59.598 --> 41:04.226
If you give up that right, anything you do
or say can and will be used against you.

41:04.226 --> 41:06.248
Capt. Cragen?

41:25.846 --> 41:32.399
This little boy's mother stuck his hands
on a frying pan until his fingers burned off.

41:35.053 --> 41:37.366
This rape victim...

41:37.366 --> 41:40.605
required 12 hours of surgery to
have a steel plate into her head

41:40.605 --> 41:45.397
after her attacker pummeled her
with a claw hammer.

41:49.827 --> 41:52.560
This one didn't make it.

41:57.556 --> 41:59.146
Is there anybody on this panel

41:59.146 --> 42:03.632
who doesn't share Det. Stabler's anger
for the perpetrators?

42:03.632 --> 42:05.890
This man is a good cop.

42:07.162 --> 42:10.194
As his commanding officer,
I stand with him

42:10.194 --> 42:13.733
and every good cop who faces
these horrors day after day

42:13.733 --> 42:17.759
and has the strength to keep
their impulses in check.

42:17.759 --> 42:21.903
Now if you can look at these pictures
and not understand that

42:21.903 --> 42:27.854
the problem here isn't Elliot Stabler, is it?

42:34.745 --> 42:37.233
Yeah, that's done.
That's done. / Hello?

42:37.233 --> 42:40.236
- All right, yeah, go get the kids dinner...
- Yeah.

42:40.236 --> 42:42.082
Kathleen! / Sure.

42:42.082 --> 42:46.175
- Dickie, Elizabeth, dinner's ready!
- All right tomorrow. Captain...

42:46.175 --> 42:49.397
thanks for the support.

42:53.822 --> 42:55.875
Well?

42:59.161 --> 43:01.634
The Morris Commission cleared me.

43:01.634 --> 43:05.085
Special Victims Unit Squadroom
Wednesday, September 20

43:13.880 --> 43:16.364
- Capt. Cragen?
- Not now.

43:17.590 --> 43:20.782
Monique Jeffries.
Maybe I can help?

43:20.969 --> 43:24.400
Fin Tutuola, I've been re-assigned.

43:26.014 --> 43:28.463
You're here for my job.

43:29.635 --> 43:31.173
This is awkward.

43:31.173 --> 43:34.354
Well, try my side of the moment.
