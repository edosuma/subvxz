00:01.320 --> 00:02.037
<i>Every moment</i>

00:02.200 --> 00:03.714
<i>of your life is a test,</i>

00:03.960 --> 00:05.917
<i>one that reveals
who you are.</i>

00:06.080 --> 00:08.993
<i>And if you truly
are worthy of the name Zod,</i>

00:09.240 --> 00:11.038
<i>you will follow
in the footsteps of those</i>

00:11.200 --> 00:12.714
<i>who have come before you.</i>

00:13.040 --> 00:15.430
<i>Or you will die trying.</i>

00:15.600 --> 00:17.751
If you didn't know
Brainiac had corrupted

00:17.920 --> 00:20.515
<i>the Voice of Rao,
then why even attempt a coup?</i>

00:20.680 --> 00:23.400
<i>Because Daron-Vex
offered to spare your life</i>

00:23.560 --> 00:25.358
<i>in exchange for my help.</i>

00:25.520 --> 00:27.318
- Stop!
- And I would do it again.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.080
Hello, Father.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.080
I came to tell you...

00:31.240 --> 00:32.640
<i>that I forgive you</i>

00:34.280 --> 00:36.840
for what
you tried to do to me.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.274
Black Zero is in.

00:40.680 --> 00:41.880
They want something in return.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.636
There he is.
My old friend, Daron-Vex.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.752
We have a lot
of catching up to do.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.480
Ona!

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
What's wrong?

00:53.640 --> 00:55.279
Through fire,
we are reborn.

01:06.080 --> 01:08.720
<i>I learned of
a pre-cataclysm instrument</i>

01:08.920 --> 01:10.991
<i>of violence so powerful</i>

01:12.000 --> 01:14.151
<i>it would give
even Brainiac pause.</i>

01:14.560 --> 01:15.596
That thing in there,

01:15.800 --> 01:17.120
they told me
it's called Doomsday.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.680
If you let
that thing loose

01:18.840 --> 01:20.832
it will kill everything
that it comes across.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.160
It's true.

01:22.280 --> 01:23.776
That's why we have given
over our lives

01:23.800 --> 01:25.792
to protecting the universe
from Doomsday.

01:55.480 --> 01:57.358
What does
this alien want?

01:57.520 --> 01:59.239
To rip this city
right from the ground

01:59.400 --> 02:00.629
and add it to his collection.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.032
You didn't really think

02:02.200 --> 02:03.839
the Voice of Rao was a god,
did you?

02:05.400 --> 02:07.960
Why kill the chancellor?
And the others?

02:08.160 --> 02:10.231
All I can say
is there's going to be

02:10.440 --> 02:11.960
a lot more bodies
if we don't find him.

02:13.920 --> 02:14.920
Look...

02:15.320 --> 02:17.232
I can't risk
being up here any longer.

02:17.480 --> 02:18.480
Just have you Sagitari...

02:18.600 --> 02:20.239
You mean what's left
of the Sagitari?

02:21.040 --> 02:22.793
They're already
spread too thin.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.430
The remains of the Council
are either dead or in hiding.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.319
The Primus has turned traitor.

02:27.640 --> 02:30.280
Black Zero is openly
walking the streets.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.715
I can't help you.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.720
Does anyone know
what's happening?

02:35.920 --> 02:37.354
Back. Back!

02:37.520 --> 02:39.360
How come they haven't
addressed the people yet?

02:40.080 --> 02:40.831
Move! Now!

02:41.080 --> 02:42.434
Do us a favor
and go back inside.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.672
It's not safe out here.
Go on! Move!

02:45.160 --> 02:47.595
Back off!

02:47.760 --> 02:49.672
You, come here!

02:49.880 --> 02:51.792
Was this Black Zero?

02:51.960 --> 02:55.397
Clear the streets!

02:55.920 --> 02:57.354
Whoa.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.840
It's chaos out there.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.992
I know.
And it's getting worse.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.336
Pretty soon people
are going to figure out

03:04.360 --> 03:05.396
that no one's in charge.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.640
Then the whole city is going
to descend into anarchy.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.433
Making it even harder
to find the Voice.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.918
Three days of searching
and nothing.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.276
Nyssa said they found a trail
of mangled bodies

03:14.440 --> 03:16.238
leading out
of the Tower of Justice.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.240
She's there now.
She's trying to find out more.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.280
Brave of her.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.711
We need to find him, Lyta.
We need to find him

03:21.880 --> 03:23.480
and stop him
from bringing Brainiac here.

03:23.640 --> 03:24.640
We will.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.396
And we'll make him pay
for what he's done.

03:30.920 --> 03:31.990
How's Dev?

03:32.640 --> 03:34.518
I-I managed to get him
in a med bay.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.036
He's recovering.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.873
Itching to get back
in the fight.

03:38.840 --> 03:39.840
Good.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.678
We're going to need him.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.275
And a whole lot more
just like him.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.790
Seg...

03:52.000 --> 03:54.071
I know losing Ona
was hard for Kem,

03:55.640 --> 03:58.360
but sending him
to Kryptonopolis...

03:58.840 --> 04:01.514
Was that to help him
or to help you?

04:07.040 --> 04:08.440
I'm worried
you're starting to think

04:08.600 --> 04:12.196
this fight we're in,
that maybe we can't win it.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.354
Is that what you think?

04:34.320 --> 04:36.039
Everything that Adam said...

04:37.640 --> 04:39.518
about my grandson,
about the Els,

04:39.680 --> 04:41.114
about who we are...

04:42.640 --> 04:44.233
who we're meant to be.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.196
He believed that
I could save the universe.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.951
I couldn't even save him.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.112
I've lost too many people
already, Lyta.

05:00.760 --> 05:03.036
I can't lose anyone else.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.714
You're not
going to lose me.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.439
<i>You can't stop me.</i>

06:09.920 --> 06:16.110
<i>I'm coming for you
and your world.</i>

06:58.080 --> 06:59.116
That's a lot of hardware.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.511
The Voice of Rao is wounded.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.000
And like all wounded animals,

07:03.120 --> 07:04.679
this is when
they are most dangerous.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.439
No one's seen him.
He's in hiding.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.800
It's not him
we're going after.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.799
The fall in the Genesis Chamber
didn't kill the Voice.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.040
The only way to fight something
that cannot be killed

07:14.240 --> 07:16.800
is with a weapon
that is unkillable.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.439
We're going to get Doomsday?

07:40.200 --> 07:42.954
Look how far you've fallen,
old friend.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.352
The same could be
said for you,

07:48.760 --> 07:50.513
Sela-Sonn.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.671
How does one transition...

07:55.280 --> 07:56.839
from one of the most respected

07:57.000 --> 07:59.435
and highly regarded members
of the Science Guild,

07:59.760 --> 08:02.878
protÃ©gÃ© of the great Val-El,
no less,

08:03.280 --> 08:04.919
to leader of an insurgency

08:05.080 --> 08:08.437
whose only currency
is death and destruction?

08:09.320 --> 08:11.596
It started with a betrayal.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.153
From someone I trusted.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.999
You think
I didn't know?

08:25.280 --> 08:27.078
That you'd covered
your tracks so well

08:27.240 --> 08:29.038
I wouldn't follow them
back to you.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.519
That's no excuse.

08:38.039 --> 08:41.272
You dedicated your life
to saving lives.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.352
Not destroying them.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.679
That was a long time ago.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.399
And all my work trying
to ease people's suffering

08:52.600 --> 08:55.877
gave me keen insight
into how to inflict it.

08:57.520 --> 09:00.194
I have a lot of questions
for you, Daron,

09:00.640 --> 09:02.359
and I intend
to get answers.

09:07.720 --> 09:10.110
And my name is Jax-Ur now.

09:30.840 --> 09:31.876
Lyta's disappeared.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.160
So has Zod.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.435
With far more firepower
than one man can handle

09:36.880 --> 09:38.872
and with one
of Black Zero's skimmers.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.720
They're going for Doomsday.

09:42.920 --> 09:44.400
To think
you were all expecting me

09:44.600 --> 09:46.239
to screw you guys over.

09:56.720 --> 09:58.996
I realize
this wasn't easy for you.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.754
Going against Seg.

10:02.120 --> 10:05.477
And I understand
why you admire his idealism.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.552
But ideals are no good
to the dead.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.671
It was sheer luck
that he survived

10:11.880 --> 10:13.200
that blast in the tavern.

10:13.360 --> 10:14.360
Get to the point.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.160
It's up to us to save him
and everyone else.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.719
And the only way we can do that
is by making the hard choices.

10:21.400 --> 10:25.110
Even ones as extreme
as unleashing Doomsday.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.154
But how can we be sure?

10:30.360 --> 10:32.352
You said Doomsday
is a genetically engineered

10:32.520 --> 10:34.120
killing machine
that can't be controlled.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.516
He functions
like any apex predator.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.950
Focusing on the most
formidable opponent first.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.077
- That's Brainiac.
- Great.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.600
And after that,
he'll work his way

10:42.720 --> 10:43.720
down the food chain.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.240
That's us.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.715
Before that happens,

10:47.320 --> 10:48.834
we return him to stasis.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.711
We're risking a lot on
being able to pull that off.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.274
That's Seg talking.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.312
Don't think of this
as a betrayal.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.194
You and I, we're Zods.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.238
Duty-bound
to protect our people

11:00.440 --> 11:01.760
by any means necessary.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.230
Seg's an El.

11:03.360 --> 11:04.840
He will never understand that.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.834
But at least he'll be alive
to forgive you.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.879
So how are you planning
on getting inside?

11:41.600 --> 11:42.680
I'd like to know that, too.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.601
'Cause all that firepower isn't
going to get you in there.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.231
You need a Zod and an El.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.834
And I won't do it.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
I don't need you to.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.797
Lyta, you once asked

12:03.960 --> 12:05.792
if I knew who my father was.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.872
At the time,
I didn't.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.080
But I do now.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.913
House of Zod...

12:19.880 --> 12:21.075
House of El.

12:23.520 --> 12:26.479
You're both.
You're my son.

12:50.840 --> 12:51.910
Where is it?

12:56.080 --> 12:57.560
Seg, if you know something...

12:57.720 --> 12:59.677
Doomsday is already
far beyond your reach.

13:00.600 --> 13:01.600
I've made sure of that.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.390
You knew.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.439
It was your mother
who convinced me.

13:09.360 --> 13:11.352
She knew that Zod
would come for it.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.000
I just never thought
that you'd help him do it.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.354
You couldn't
have moved it far.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.399
- I will find it.
- You like to believe

13:19.560 --> 13:21.313
you're a few steps ahead,
General.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.840
But it turns out I know these
tunnels better than you do.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.952
How else do you think
we beat you here,

13:26.360 --> 13:28.317
when you snuck away
in the middle of the night?

13:30.960 --> 13:33.111
Then you have sealed
Krypton's fate.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.280
Careful.

13:35.520 --> 13:36.874
<i>Seg, come in.</i>

13:38.720 --> 13:39.720
Go ahead.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.629
<i>We have a problem.</i>

13:47.680 --> 13:49.512
Admit it, Daron.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.915
Admit what you did
and this pain will end.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.719
I didn't do anything.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.913
Exactly.

13:59.560 --> 14:00.676
I trusted you.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.672
I told you of my fears
and you did nothing.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.273
You were the one who
restored the Codex technology.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.438
What did you think
was going to happen?

14:15.640 --> 14:18.075
Without my work on the Codex,
the Genesis Chamber

14:18.240 --> 14:19.833
would have become
unsustainable

14:20.040 --> 14:23.078
and we would have lost
our only means of reproduction.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.555
Well, if your intentions
were so noble...

14:30.080 --> 14:32.879
why is you work shrouded
in such secrecy?

14:33.120 --> 14:34.713
Because I knew

14:34.880 --> 14:36.792
that in the wrong hands
it could be used

14:36.920 --> 14:39.799
to purify
the Guilded bloodlines.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.316
Weed out those viewed
as weaker.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.315
Just never
could have imagined

14:45.480 --> 14:47.199
you would be
the one to betray me.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.037
Back then, the only people
I trusted were you

14:52.240 --> 14:53.435
<i>and Val-El.</i>

14:54.840 --> 14:56.957
<i>And when you
sentenced him to death...</i>

14:58.000 --> 14:59.195
<i>I knew I was next.</i>

15:02.600 --> 15:04.956
That's not the worst
of it, is it, Daron?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.037
You had to take it
one step further.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.798
Yes, I know about
the Vara Protocol.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.640
And now you are going
to tell me how to access it.

15:30.280 --> 15:31.475
Why have we stopped?

15:35.520 --> 15:36.840
What's happening?

15:39.600 --> 15:41.239
Raika, what's going on?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.434
The containment field.

15:44.640 --> 15:45.640
It is failing.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.275
What do you mean, failing?

15:51.720 --> 15:53.712
He thinks we damaged it
when we moved it.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.031
This is all that keeps
the beast inside.

15:57.720 --> 15:58.870
How long do we have?

15:59.080 --> 16:00.230
It is ancient technology.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.916
It could be
days or weeks.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.070
Or maybe hours.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.515
One thing is certain,

16:09.680 --> 16:11.911
the beast will break free
of his tomb.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.069
Now I know why,
growing up,

16:26.240 --> 16:28.311
my mother never spoke
of her mother.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.160
The shame she must have felt.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.112
Your willingness
to betray everything

16:34.400 --> 16:35.834
the House of Zod stands for.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.674
I'm fighting
for a better Kandor.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.754
You and I can restore
order to Kandor.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.754
I reclaim my role
as Primus of the Sagitari,

16:46.920 --> 16:48.479
and with you by my side

16:48.600 --> 16:50.512
we can rebuild our city.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.154
Return it to what it once was.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.120
Not the Kandor
he wants to create,

16:54.320 --> 16:56.471
a place ruled by fear!

16:57.760 --> 16:59.479
How can you say that?

17:00.560 --> 17:02.552
All my life
all you have done

17:02.720 --> 17:03.995
is made me afraid.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.712
Afraid that I wasn't
good enough.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.916
That I wasn't strong enough.

17:09.119 --> 17:12.352
That I wasn't worthy
of the Zod name.

17:12.839 --> 17:14.433
I have failed you

17:14.839 --> 17:16.718
in so many ways, Lyta.

17:17.760 --> 17:21.231
I tried to mold you
into a hardened warrior.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.119
Tried to drive out
your love for Seg.

17:24.280 --> 17:27.955
Your refusal to follow orders
you disagreed with.

17:28.119 --> 17:32.239
I saw your constant questioning
as a weakness.

17:32.480 --> 17:36.759
And now I see
it's your greatest strength.

17:36.920 --> 17:39.833
Don't lose it now
when you need it most.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.392
Because you're going
to have to make a choice.

17:50.600 --> 17:51.880
Grandpa, come in.
Do you read me?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.071
Yes.
What's wrong?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.596
You weren't by any chance
programmed by

17:57.200 --> 17:58.759
real Grandpa
with a working knowledge

17:58.920 --> 18:00.600
of ancient Kryptonian
technology, were you?

18:00.760 --> 18:02.638
Like, say,
how to repair

18:02.800 --> 18:04.416
the containment field
on a capsule designed

18:04.440 --> 18:06.636
to hold a genetic experiment
gone horribly wrong?

18:06.960 --> 18:08.917
No,
but I'd be willing to try.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.834
Well, that's
confidence-inspiring.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.639
Would you like me
to divert my efforts

18:15.840 --> 18:18.639
from determining the proximity
of Brainiac's ship?

18:19.320 --> 18:20.720
Has it arrived
in our system yet?

18:21.040 --> 18:23.350
No, but it's only
a matter of time.

18:23.640 --> 18:24.312
Then let's concentrate

18:24.480 --> 18:26.517
on problems closer
to home first.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.315
Thank you, old friend.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.274
You've been very helpful.

18:38.480 --> 18:39.480
Wait!

18:41.320 --> 18:43.039
There's one more secret

18:44.240 --> 18:46.960
I didn't divulge
to your leader.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.356
And what would that be?

18:50.120 --> 18:51.634
One that could make you

18:52.800 --> 18:55.838
one of the richest men
in Kandor.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.469
The location of
the Voice of Rao's cache

18:58.640 --> 19:00.916
of untraceable solars.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.117
You can't buy me.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.674
Perhaps you just haven't
been offered the right price.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.114
Think of your family.

19:10.120 --> 19:11.998
All that you could
do for them.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.560
I have no family.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.875
They died
in the Xarxas outbreak.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.800
All the medication
was rationed to the Guilded.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.394
It was not a quick death.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.952
So unless you can
bring them back,

19:28.120 --> 19:30.874
you have nothing
I could want.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.759
Please.
Please.

19:32.920 --> 19:33.920
You have to help me.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.879
Look into your heart.
I'm begging you.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.350
You can't let me die here.

19:37.680 --> 19:38.477
No, please!

19:38.640 --> 19:39.994
I'll do anything.
Anything!

19:40.440 --> 19:41.874
Just please, please,
let me g...

19:48.680 --> 19:49.875
Please!
Please!

19:50.400 --> 19:52.835
Please, you can't
leave me in here!

19:53.520 --> 19:54.520
Please!

19:56.840 --> 19:58.877
Please, help me.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.952
I can't die here
in this place.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.716
Talk to Raika about
the fastest way to the surface.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.474
I'm going
to go get the skimmer.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.354
Or we could not
do that.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.269
What are you doing?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.400
It is time for my people

20:43.560 --> 20:45.313
to rid themself
of this burden.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.912
We will take the creature
to your city.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.276
And risk the lives
of everyone in Kandor?

20:50.440 --> 20:51.999
You can't be serious.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.351
Look, you'll never get it
through the Outlands.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.712
These catacombs
contain many secrets.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.873
Even a tunnel to your city.

21:00.920 --> 21:03.151
And when the Collector
of Worlds comes for Kandor,

21:04.960 --> 21:06.599
he will take Doomsday
along with it.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.991
And my people will be free
of their duty.

21:10.160 --> 21:11.799
And Krypton will be free
of the threat

21:11.960 --> 21:13.030
from that vile creature.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.317
That's not
going to happen.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.360
We're going to stop Brainiac.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.113
You cannot even stop
your own people

21:19.320 --> 21:20.480
from trying
to take the beast.

21:21.040 --> 21:24.078
How will you defeat
an alien conqueror?

21:25.040 --> 21:26.759
You will fail, Seg-El.

21:26.920 --> 21:27.920
Listen to me.

21:28.360 --> 21:31.159
If Brainiac is allowed
to take Kandor,

21:31.320 --> 21:34.279
then eventually all of Krypton
will be destroyed as a result.

21:34.440 --> 21:35.440
Eventually.

21:36.040 --> 21:38.111
We're guaranteed destruction
far sooner

21:38.280 --> 21:40.954
if we do not rid ourself
of this scourge.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.120
You saved my life once.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.233
And for that,
I will allow both of you

22:00.400 --> 22:01.720
to leave this place alive.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.675
But try to stop us,

22:04.000 --> 22:05.957
and you will die
where you stand.

22:19.520 --> 22:20.920
I'm done wasting time.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.119
Are you really
going to shoot me?

22:25.320 --> 22:27.755
Take one step further
and find out.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.274
Then do it.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.517
Better that than
stand here doing nothing

22:31.680 --> 22:33.751
with our planet
facing destruction.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.797
Mother stop,
please don't do this.

22:39.680 --> 22:40.680
No!

22:42.280 --> 22:43.280
Very well.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.311
You say you intend
to restore Kandor

22:51.480 --> 22:54.791
and reclaim your position
as Primus of the Sagitari.

22:55.680 --> 22:57.831
Well, so do I.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.793
Jayna-Zod,
I, Dru-Zod,

23:06.960 --> 23:09.236
hereby invoke the spirit
of Jo-Mon

23:09.440 --> 23:11.636
and our ancient traditions
in challenging you

23:11.800 --> 23:14.110
to a Kandorian Duel.

23:15.080 --> 23:19.040
For the loser,
no mercy will be shown.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.674
I accept.

23:29.400 --> 23:30.595
Mother...

23:41.640 --> 23:44.155
Are you being quiet because
you're coming up with a plan?

23:45.520 --> 23:47.239
The Voice of Rao
is still helping Brainiac

23:47.440 --> 23:50.433
get here to take Kandor...
which now has

23:50.600 --> 23:52.319
a genetically-engineered
killing machine

23:52.440 --> 23:53.669
ready to break free
of its cage

23:53.840 --> 23:55.797
somewhere underneath it.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.200
You know,

23:57.680 --> 23:59.194
we could take a skimmer,

23:59.840 --> 24:01.832
make a break for Argo City.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.016
If you're planning on joining
the rapidly swelling ranks

24:04.040 --> 24:05.599
of people screwing me over,

24:05.760 --> 24:07.717
I'd appreciate it
if you just got it over with.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.233
I'm not Lyta.

24:13.440 --> 24:15.193
I believe in you.

24:22.840 --> 24:24.115
Maybe you shouldn't.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.079
You sell skimmers, right?

25:16.320 --> 25:18.232
I want the fastest one
you have.

25:19.640 --> 25:22.360
One that won't be picked up
by any of the city scanners.

25:22.520 --> 25:25.752
One that I am prepared
to pay a great deal for.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.556
In fact...

25:27.720 --> 25:31.396
I could make you one
of the richest men in Kandor.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.151
Adam should have given
this to someone else.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.273
Instead of giving
his life for mine.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.080
But he chose you.

26:11.280 --> 26:12.760
Yeah, well,
you met Adam.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.513
Not to speak ill of the dead,
but...

26:17.600 --> 26:20.160
he wasn't exactly
the brightest star in the sky.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.480
He picked a guy...

26:24.200 --> 26:25.200
whose only accomplishment

26:25.360 --> 26:28.910
is having a grandson,
who I'll never meet...

26:31.280 --> 26:33.033
Who does something great
one day.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.080
Becomes a hero.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.630
Becomes this...

26:41.400 --> 26:42.400
Superman.

26:46.440 --> 26:49.319
Do you know
the origins of the El sigil?

26:51.920 --> 26:54.389
It comes from
an ancient Kryptonian word.

26:54.640 --> 26:55.869
That means hope.

26:58.120 --> 27:01.033
Our house wasn't
just given that symbol.

27:01.960 --> 27:03.952
Our ancestors chose it.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.591
And the generations
to follow defined it.

27:10.120 --> 27:11.713
Not through words...

27:13.200 --> 27:14.520
but through action.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.720
As long as there is
an El on Krypton,

27:20.600 --> 27:22.831
there will be hope.

27:23.840 --> 27:24.910
And hope...

27:26.680 --> 27:28.831
can be a powerful weapon.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.034
Get away from me.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.793
- How dare you.
- What?

28:41.960 --> 28:43.792
Intervening
in a Kandorian Duel.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.355
I saved you.

28:45.520 --> 28:46.795
You stole my honor.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.633
Oh, would you like
to be buried with it?

28:49.320 --> 28:50.680
You talk about making
hard choices.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.399
Well, I have made one.

28:59.640 --> 29:00.640
Forget her.

29:01.760 --> 29:02.910
We have to go.

29:10.640 --> 29:11.640
What is it?

29:12.560 --> 29:13.994
Daron-Vex escaped.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.439
Fled in a skimmer.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.276
He could be halfway through
Outlands by now.

29:21.400 --> 29:22.800
Ever the survivor.

29:47.840 --> 29:49.752
Still can't reach Jayna.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.320
We need
to get through to her.

29:52.880 --> 29:54.336
She's the one best suited
to tracking down

29:54.360 --> 29:55.760
the Cythonnites and Doomsday.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.559
And the other problem?

29:57.800 --> 29:59.154
Been thinking about that too.

29:59.800 --> 30:00.950
We never knew why the Voice

30:01.120 --> 30:02.840
was draining power
from the Genesis Chamber.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.634
But I think I know now,
and if I'm right

30:05.800 --> 30:07.632
Brainiac will be here sooner
than we thought.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.231
What if he needs it
to power Brainiac's ship?

30:13.680 --> 30:14.680
Bring it here.

30:15.160 --> 30:17.038
He's probably looking
for another source.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.240
But where else would he
get that kind of power?

30:20.280 --> 30:21.280
Grandpa?

30:21.760 --> 30:23.160
There's only one option.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.874
The generator that powers
the city's protective dome.

30:27.040 --> 30:28.440
Then that's where
we make our stand.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.514
But we're going to need help.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.831
This could be our last chance
to save Kandor.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.776
You want me to commit
the few remaining Sagitari

30:36.800 --> 30:39.156
we have left to work
alongside terrorists?

30:39.320 --> 30:41.277
Never!
They have hunted us,

30:41.440 --> 30:43.875
executed us,
forced us underground,

30:44.040 --> 30:47.078
and now you want us to turn
to our oppressors for help,

30:47.280 --> 30:48.976
at the very moment
when we've gained a foothold?

30:49.000 --> 30:51.720
That foothold's about
to be ripped from under you.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.030
And it will happen.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.511
Brainiac is coming
and he will take Kandor.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.797
Unless we declare a truce.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.320
And combine our forces

30:59.480 --> 31:01.153
to put an end
to this threat to our world.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.990
All right,
but when this is over

31:05.440 --> 31:07.397
we will round up Black Zero

31:07.560 --> 31:08.914
and take back the city.

31:09.080 --> 31:10.514
We will shatter the Guilds,

31:10.720 --> 31:12.040
strip the ranked
of their power,

31:12.200 --> 31:14.351
and we will return Kandor
to its people.

31:14.640 --> 31:15.840
Or maybe,
instead of both sides

31:16.000 --> 31:17.912
killing each other
we can use this as a chance

31:18.080 --> 31:19.878
to build a better tomorrow.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.793
You sound
like your grandfather.

31:25.480 --> 31:27.949
Don't forget which side
had him executed.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.956
Jayna.
Jayna!

33:15.920 --> 33:18.151
Daron-Vex,
manual override.

33:19.800 --> 33:24.079
Passcode:
Hantha, Flame-bird, Rokan,

33:24.280 --> 33:29.400
Oregus, two, nine,
seven, one, eight.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.312
<i>Passcode accepted.</i>

33:32.840 --> 33:34.672
Initiate Vara Protocol.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.360
What are they?

33:55.760 --> 33:56.955
Clones.

33:58.560 --> 34:01.439
Of the most
elite ranked houses.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.554
For what?

34:04.200 --> 34:05.656
So that the people
who have everything

34:05.680 --> 34:06.875
can hold onto it.

34:08.239 --> 34:09.469
Forever.

34:19.760 --> 34:22.400
With our combined forces
we can defeat him,

34:23.880 --> 34:25.280
but it will come at a cost.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.551
I know that we all
have our differences here.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.514
But we only have one city

34:37.960 --> 34:41.078
and a common enemy
who wants to take it from us.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.080
So let's work together.

34:43.480 --> 34:47.110
Let's hit the Voice of Rao
with everything that we've got.

34:47.560 --> 34:48.880
I don't take orders from you.

34:49.040 --> 34:51.315
I don't take orders
from you either, or you.

34:52.040 --> 34:54.998
It wasn't so much an order
as a common sense suggestion.

34:56.800 --> 34:58.154
Now you do what
you have to do.

35:00.400 --> 35:01.436
But I'm going.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.834
Look, if this goes badly...

35:14.720 --> 35:16.677
and there's every indication
that it will...

35:17.640 --> 35:18.915
I want you to take this.

35:19.960 --> 35:21.474
You go to the fortress,
you tell Val

35:21.680 --> 35:23.640
to shut everything down,
and you take that skimmer

35:23.760 --> 35:24.876
to Argo City.

35:25.480 --> 35:27.437
Sure you wouldn't
rather me take a blaster?

35:27.640 --> 35:29.120
I need you to do this.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.953
You're the only one
that I can trust.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.719
<i>Unit 1,
in position.</i>

36:14.840 --> 36:16.513
<i>Unit 2,
in position.</i>

36:17.120 --> 36:19.191
Unit 3,
in position.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.440
Let's go.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.360
Fascinating.

36:45.040 --> 36:48.351
Opposing forces
with nothing in common

36:48.600 --> 36:51.320
but their obsession
with power.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.716
One hoping to cling to it,

36:53.880 --> 36:55.951
the other to seize it.

36:56.520 --> 36:59.319
Now united...

36:59.480 --> 37:01.790
against me.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.000
But tell me:

37:09.200 --> 37:10.873
does you fear of me

37:11.280 --> 37:14.637
outweigh your fear
of each other?

37:24.720 --> 37:26.473
- What are you doing?
- It's not me!

37:26.680 --> 37:27.680
I swear!

37:30.320 --> 37:31.640
Whoa!
whoa!

37:31.800 --> 37:34.315
Guns down! Guns down!
Guns down!

37:34.520 --> 37:36.193
Such weak minds.

37:36.360 --> 37:40.434
Polluted by fear
and hatred.

37:40.600 --> 37:43.399
So easily manipulated.

37:44.520 --> 37:45.556
Go on.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.758
You know you want to.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.479
You did what you had to do.

38:09.400 --> 38:10.440
If we don't find Doomsday,

38:10.640 --> 38:12.199
this will all have been
for nothing.

38:12.400 --> 38:13.400
Maybe not.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.096
Doomsday was the only way
I could see

38:15.120 --> 38:16.679
to destroy Brainiac,
but there may be

38:16.840 --> 38:18.240
someone who has another way.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Who?

38:21.960 --> 38:22.960
Val-El.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.231
Val-El died 14 cycles ago.

38:26.800 --> 38:27.950
No, he didn't.

38:40.320 --> 38:43.199
You think
I'm responsible for this?

38:46.400 --> 38:49.871
All did
was offer an opportunity

38:50.000 --> 38:52.151
for them to express
their truth.

38:52.320 --> 38:55.358
So easy when
the desire is so strong.

38:55.560 --> 38:58.871
Now come closer.

39:15.560 --> 39:16.835
Interesting...

39:17.760 --> 39:21.800
that you, a being
of no apparent significance,

39:22.200 --> 39:24.157
are the cause
of so much trouble.

39:25.160 --> 39:26.389
A shame.

39:26.560 --> 39:29.632
You would have been
quite the prize.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.190
If I'm being 100% honest,

40:19.360 --> 40:20.953
I really didn't
expect that to happen.

40:22.880 --> 40:23.916
You all right?

40:25.040 --> 40:27.350
Shouldn't you be on
that skimmer to Argo City?

41:08.160 --> 41:09.196
We have to go.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.080
We have to go.

41:43.080 --> 41:44.833
Krypton.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.478
Your world

41:47.640 --> 41:50.155
is mine.
