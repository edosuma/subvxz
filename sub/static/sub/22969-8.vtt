WEBVTT

00:00.601 --> 00:02.770
Come on!

00:02.803 --> 00:04.705
( music playing )

00:04.738 --> 00:07.041
- Hurry up!
- Whoo.

00:07.075 --> 00:08.576
- ( laughing )
- Whoo.

00:13.147 --> 00:15.583
( bike squeaking )

00:15.616 --> 00:17.485
( grunts )

00:17.518 --> 00:19.787
I'm sorry.
I've never ridden
through the woods and I--

00:19.820 --> 00:22.790
Oh, no.
My snow globe!

00:22.823 --> 00:24.592
It was a present
from my dad.

00:26.394 --> 00:29.197
Forget the stupid snow globe.
Look at your bike.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.165
You can't ride that thing,
and I'm not waiting for you.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.600
You're just gonna
leave me here?

00:32.633 --> 00:33.801
Yeah.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.771
Boy:
Let's get outta here.

00:51.319 --> 00:53.087
( wolf howling )

00:53.887 --> 00:56.090
( heavy breathing )

00:59.393 --> 01:01.662
( wolf howling )

01:01.695 --> 01:03.697
( panting )

01:05.333 --> 01:07.168
( grunting )

01:07.201 --> 01:10.304
( heavy breathing )

01:18.546 --> 01:21.549
( theme music playing )

01:29.223 --> 01:31.659
That is one pissed off
Incan princess!

01:31.692 --> 01:34.662
( grunts )
You'd be pissed too if you had
been used in a human sacrifice!

01:34.695 --> 01:37.798
Worry about the mummy's
feelings later, guys.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.268
Cassandra,
how are we doing?
( grunts )

01:40.301 --> 01:42.303
If Wassen was right,
then the progression of values

01:42.336 --> 01:44.505
depends on the position
of the table.

01:44.538 --> 01:45.806
Baird:
Cassandra, let's go!

01:45.839 --> 01:48.676
It's, uh--
I think it's this one.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.145
No! No, no, no, no, no.
No!

01:51.179 --> 01:52.846
No! No, no, no, no.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.283
- Come on!
- Stone: Cassandra!

01:55.316 --> 01:58.919
Come on, Cassandra!
You gotta do it!
( grunting )

01:58.952 --> 02:01.355
Cassandra!

02:01.389 --> 02:03.324
- Come on, Cassandra,
you can do this!
- Cassandra!

02:03.357 --> 02:06.260
We can't hold much longer!
Cassandra!

02:06.294 --> 02:08.262
- ( yelling )
- Cassandra!

02:08.296 --> 02:11.565
- No! No! No! No! No!
- Stone: Cassandra!

02:11.599 --> 02:13.834
- Cassandra? So sorry.
- ( gasps )

02:13.867 --> 02:15.603
Didn't mean
to startle you.

02:15.636 --> 02:19.407
I was, um, searching for
the hazardous materials list.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.811
Oh, thank you.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.480
I was just, uh,
cataloguing the grimoires.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.849
- Hmm.
- Inventory week is exhausting.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.252
Yes.

02:31.285 --> 02:32.420
What does that say?

02:34.888 --> 02:36.524
It says you need bifocals.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.561
I... ( exhales sharply )

02:40.594 --> 02:42.796
And one more annoyance
of the human body.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.632
Not only does it decay,
now I have to go see

02:44.665 --> 02:47.868
the purveyor of eyeglasses?

02:47.901 --> 02:49.603
Um, oh.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.909
I couldn't help notice, uh,

02:55.943 --> 02:58.279
your nap did not seem
very restful.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.348
The Ecuador mission again?

03:00.381 --> 03:01.382
Yeah.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.386
I can't seem to let it go.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.623
I was gonna die.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.725
Not to seem unsympathetic,

03:11.759 --> 03:15.629
but that's not
a unique experience for you.

03:15.663 --> 03:18.832
Exactly, but I had my tumor,
I was always...

03:18.866 --> 03:21.235
going to die, and...

03:21.269 --> 03:24.405
now, I mean, I could live
to be 100 years old.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.574
Hmm.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.309
And I risked that
for what?

03:28.342 --> 03:31.312
You saved the world
from an Incan curse.

03:31.345 --> 03:34.782
Mr. Jones found the lever.
You got back safely.

03:34.815 --> 03:38.552
But that won't always
be the case.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.821
I failed because I was scared.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.022
I couldn't solve the problem,
Jenkins.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.725
I...

03:44.758 --> 03:47.328
couldn't think.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.730
Cassandra...

03:49.763 --> 03:52.333
recently my life
was shortened

03:52.366 --> 03:55.636
when I voluntarily chose
to forfeit my immortality.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.971
It made me reflect.

03:58.005 --> 04:02.810
Reflect on, uh,
well, my purpose... here,

04:02.843 --> 04:04.612
in the Library.

04:04.645 --> 04:08.882
How best to use the time
that was left to me.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.751
Well, did you come
to a conclusion?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.453
My conclusions
aren't important.

04:12.486 --> 04:15.689
What you want to do-- be,

04:15.723 --> 04:17.291
that's what's important.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.032
- Leaving?
- Not leaving.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.701
Just a brief sabbatical.
An extended hiatus.

04:27.735 --> 04:30.638
Hey, if she gets to bugger off
during inventory week,
then so do I.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.806
Look, I get it.
You got rattled.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.608
Soldiers face this
all the time,

04:34.642 --> 04:36.810
but you're not one to hide
from your problems, Cassandra.

04:36.844 --> 04:38.646
What if Darrington Dare
was right?

04:38.679 --> 04:40.681
I mean, what if there's only
supposed to be one Librarian?

04:40.714 --> 04:42.483
- I mean, what are the odds
that it's me?
- ( rustling )

04:42.516 --> 04:43.884
( grunts )
One in four?

04:43.917 --> 04:46.320
Actually one in three
now that Flynn's gone.

04:46.354 --> 04:49.623
Right? Exactly. Flynn.
Flynn Carsen left the Library,

04:49.657 --> 04:51.392
and he's Mr. Library.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.026
It's just I've never had
normal before.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.662
If I'm not meant to be
the Librarian,

04:54.695 --> 04:56.530
how do I know
what a normal life is for me?

04:56.564 --> 04:57.831
Okay, well,
take a little time,

04:57.865 --> 04:59.833
figure out where
you might want to go.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.403
Oh, you know
exactly where you're going
and you're going now?

05:02.436 --> 05:04.705
Havenport, Ohio.
According to my research,

05:04.738 --> 05:06.440
it is the safest town
in America,

05:06.474 --> 05:08.376
so not only will I have
a normal life,

05:08.409 --> 05:09.777
but I won't have to worry
about having a short one.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.979
Ohio? When I have
my existential freak-out,

05:12.012 --> 05:14.348
- I'm gonna do it on
a beach somewhere.
- No one's freaking out!

05:14.382 --> 05:16.384
- Are you guys okay with this?
- Uh, no.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.652
Who's gonna help me inventory
the new artifact room if you go?

05:18.686 --> 05:20.788
And by help, you mean
do it for you, right?

05:20.821 --> 05:24.024
- Exactly.
- Cassie, you take as much time
as you need, okay?

05:24.057 --> 05:26.594
The Library's always gonna have
a Librarian as long as I'm here.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.929
I know.

05:28.962 --> 05:32.800
Look, Jenkins told me he has
been thinking about his purpose
within the Library.

05:32.833 --> 05:38.439
That's what I need to do.
Find out if my purpose is here
or... elsewhere.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.476
Be safe.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.512
That's the plan.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.958
She'll be back.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.861
( trio singing )

06:07.134 --> 06:09.570
* A very, very good morning

06:09.603 --> 06:11.405
* A very, very good morning
to you *

06:11.439 --> 06:13.541
* Bop-a-loodle-doo
and howdy do *

06:13.574 --> 06:16.076
* You're gonna say it twice
'cause it's very, very nice *

06:16.109 --> 06:18.145
* A very, very good morning

06:18.178 --> 06:20.681
* A very, very good day
is dawning *

06:20.714 --> 06:22.983
- Wow.
- * A very, very good, good,
very, very good *

06:23.016 --> 06:24.852
* Good morning to you

06:27.220 --> 06:30.424
( music playing )

06:47.575 --> 06:50.210
This house was built in 1910,
so it can get drafty,

06:50.243 --> 06:52.212
but there are lots of extra
blankets in the closet.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.748
- It's perfect.
- You know, we fell in love
with it

06:54.782 --> 06:56.584
the moment the realtor
showed us.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.018
We've been here
for three years now,

06:58.051 --> 06:59.987
and we are so much
more at home here

07:00.020 --> 07:01.589
than we ever were
in the city.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.624
Speak for yourself, Mom.

07:03.657 --> 07:06.760
Hey, please pretend you have
manners and introduce yourself.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.896
Freddy, this is Cassandra.
Cassandra, this is my son,

07:08.929 --> 07:11.965
Freddy, who I promise
was not raised in a barn.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.968
Hi. Can I ride my bike
to the camera store?

07:15.002 --> 07:17.838
In Victorville? How many times
have I said no riding
outside of town?

07:17.871 --> 07:19.973
- But I need to go get--
- No.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.109
( sighs )

07:25.646 --> 07:27.214
Nice to meet you.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.550
Please ignore him.

07:29.583 --> 07:33.086
Bought him the camera
for his birthday hoping he would
join the photography club,

07:33.120 --> 07:36.557
make some friends,
but instead he just
spends more time alone.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.659
Sounds familiar.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.227
So what do you think?

07:40.260 --> 07:42.262
I'll take it.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.732
- Great. Let's introduce you
to the rest of the town.
- Yeah.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.600
- Okay.
- Okay.

07:46.634 --> 07:50.037
- I know the cutest little
lunch spot if you're hungry.
- Great.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.806
Hey, Sylvia.
Ready for the bake sale?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.942
Aren't I always?

07:54.975 --> 07:57.010
I love baking.
It's basically chemistry.

07:57.044 --> 08:00.814
I developed a pie crust recipe
that's won first place
in three counties.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.584
Ah, well, do yourself a favor
and don't tell Sylvia.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.152
She's a little bit
of a perfectionist.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.621
- Oh.
- She runs the
quilting bee, too.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.690
We meet in the library
every week.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.660
Oh, I work in a library.
I mean, I guess I used to.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.027
Then you have
to meet Penelope.

08:14.061 --> 08:16.864
Dave, don't forget
poetry night.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.066
Not a chance.
( chuckles )

08:19.099 --> 08:22.135
If you're a caffeine addict,
this place has the best
mocha lattes.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.638
And that salon,
half-price mani-pedis
every Wednesday.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.107
- Ooh! ( chuckles )
- John, Vincent, be careful now.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.009
Keep up the good work, guys.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.778
Oh, and our library
is right here.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.880
- Right across from town hall.
- Oh.

08:32.913 --> 08:36.684
Wait. There's no traffic lights.
Where are the stop signs?

08:36.717 --> 08:38.919
( chuckles )
Yeah, that threw me, too,
at first.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.855
But, you know, this place
isn't safe because of a bunch
of street signs.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.792
It's safe because people
look out for each other.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.168
I never thought we'd find a
place where we felt safe again,

08:55.202 --> 08:57.137
but people are so much
different here.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.639
One sec.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.940
- George!
- Yes?

08:59.973 --> 09:01.809
I need your blueberry crumble
recipe.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.945
( chuckles )
Of course you do.
It'll be my pleasure.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.192
Oh!

09:19.226 --> 09:21.361
- Oh!
- Whoa there. Whoa,
that was a close one.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.031
You're telling me.
That car almost hit me,
didn't it?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.066
Well, I'm sure it looked like it
from where you stood,

09:26.099 --> 09:29.737
but those kind of things
don't happen around here.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.905
No one wants
to break the record.
( chuckles )

09:31.939 --> 09:36.710
- Record?
- Well, Havenport's been
accident-free for 10,000 days.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.612
Button?

09:38.646 --> 09:41.114
Oh, Cassandra.
You almost fell.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.684
Karla.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.854
- How are you?
- I'm-- I'm great. How are you?

09:46.887 --> 09:50.057
- I'm great now that
you're here.
- ( both chuckle )

09:50.090 --> 09:52.993
Oh, I see you met my new tenant.
Uh, Cassandra, this is
Councilman Weeks.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.828
Councilman?
That's impressive.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.698
Not full time. I'm also
the local real estate agent.

09:57.731 --> 09:58.966
He sold me our house.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.968
You moving here,

10:01.001 --> 10:02.235
the town's better for it.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.805
( chuckles )

10:04.838 --> 10:09.209
Okay. I'll just, um--
I can show myself around.

10:22.990 --> 10:23.991
Enjoy.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.362
Hello.
Can I help you?

10:29.396 --> 10:32.132
Oh, I was just looking...

10:32.165 --> 10:33.333
at the library.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.169
Which is beautiful,
by the way.

10:36.203 --> 10:40.974
Thank you.
I've worked very hard over
the last 25 years to make it so.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.810
Without a vacation.

10:42.843 --> 10:46.146
Do you have
a children's science area?

10:46.179 --> 10:49.817
Sorry. I, uh,
used to work at a library.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.720
The Library.
Mostly in acquisitions.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.422
Just got to be
too dangerous.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.791
At the Library.

10:57.825 --> 11:00.293
You know, we are hiring.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.395
Probably shouldn't.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.798
Don't know how long
I'm gonna be in town, so...

11:04.832 --> 11:07.100
I'm going to get you
some paperwork, sweetie.

11:07.134 --> 11:08.335
( chuckles )

11:08.368 --> 11:11.438
- ( phone rings )
- Oh.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.040
Jenkins:
Oh, yes, Cassandra.

11:13.073 --> 11:17.144
- Hello? Mr. Jenkins?
- Yes, hi, Cassandra.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.913
- Got her. Yes, hi.
- ( static )

11:19.947 --> 11:22.783
Uh, wait, I'm sorry.
There's a lot of static.
I can't quite hear you.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.252
What? Wait, is--
is this better?

11:25.285 --> 11:27.187
Jenkins: Oh, yes, yes, yeah,
yes, yes, that's much better.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.422
Now listen, I really hate
disturbing your hiatus,

11:29.456 --> 11:35.028
but I was wondering,
could you tell me where
my Selkie Skin collection is?

11:35.062 --> 11:37.097
Have you tried the cabinet
under the aquarium?

11:37.130 --> 11:39.733
( chuckles )
There it is.
Right in front of my nose.

11:39.767 --> 11:43.170
Yes, I really do need to go see
that-- that eye doctor. I'm--

11:43.203 --> 11:47.174
- ( whispering ) I can do this.
Yes, I know that. I'm trying.
- How are you? How are you?

11:47.207 --> 11:48.241
How are you?

11:50.177 --> 11:55.448
I'm great.
It's really nice here.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.517
I think I'm getting the hang
of this being normal thing.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.821
Well, I think I speak
for all of us...

12:00.854 --> 12:02.455
when I say
that would be a tragedy.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.793
Actually, it's great.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.128
I haven't felt scared.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.163
Not even when I almost
got hit by a car.

12:10.197 --> 12:11.498
Jenkins:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
What did you--

12:11.531 --> 12:13.266
you almost got hit
by a car?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.969
One second it was going to,
and then it didn't.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.338
- Do you think that's odd?
- Do you think it's odd?

12:18.371 --> 12:20.307
You-- are you going
to investigate?

12:20.340 --> 12:22.209
No, no, no, no, no.
Not investigating.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.544
Everything is fine here.
Wonderfully normal.

12:24.577 --> 12:29.182
I'm not at the Library,
just a library.
Little L.

12:29.216 --> 12:31.451
Jenkins: Yes, well,
I'm glad that you're fi--
( static )

12:31.484 --> 12:33.787
Hello?
Jenkins?

12:33.821 --> 12:36.023
Hello?
She's gone.

12:36.056 --> 12:38.158
( exhales deeply )

12:38.191 --> 12:41.328
Well, at least
she's acclimating.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.832
For better or worse.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.534
- ( camera shutter clicks )
- ( chuckles )

12:47.567 --> 12:50.503
( exhales sharply )
I'm surprised you managed
to talk that long.

12:50.537 --> 12:54.241
This entire town
is one big dead zone,
literally and figuratively.

12:54.274 --> 12:57.177
The internet
is spotty, too.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.912
So, what was odd?

12:58.946 --> 13:00.280
Uh...

13:00.313 --> 13:02.215
You told your friend
you saw something odd.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.317
What was it?

13:04.351 --> 13:06.286
Um, nothing.

13:06.319 --> 13:09.156
It's just a near miss.
It was completely normal.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.224
Things like that happen
all the time.

13:11.258 --> 13:14.194
( exhales deeply )
For one second, I thought
you noticed it, too.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.968
You, um,
thought I noticed what?

13:21.001 --> 13:24.337
That things are off
in this town.

13:24.371 --> 13:25.839
Don't be silly.
This is the safest--

13:25.873 --> 13:28.208
Safest town in America.
I know.

13:28.241 --> 13:31.344
You know, you don't have
to invent some big mystery
if you're bored.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.247
I don't?

13:34.281 --> 13:36.549
Not when you have
all this excitement right here.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.288
Come on.

13:43.190 --> 13:47.961
Ta-dah!
Any adventure you could ever
want is right here.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.931
You want me to read a book?
I've read books.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.500
Not just any book.
Your book.

13:53.533 --> 13:57.604
The one that gets your mind
racing and your juices flowing

13:57.637 --> 14:00.240
and all of a sudden...

14:00.273 --> 14:03.043
you can be anywhere
you want.

14:03.076 --> 14:06.413
You know, put your mind
and your imagination at peril.

14:06.446 --> 14:10.183
Not your, you know, you.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.985
You want to be
in a dystopian future

14:12.019 --> 14:13.620
fighting for your life?

14:13.653 --> 14:16.323
Or, uh, ooh,

14:16.356 --> 14:19.059
on a remote desert island
with pirates?

14:19.092 --> 14:24.031
Or romancing the lord
of the manor.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.966
No?
Probably more my thing.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.168
Ooh, what about this?

14:28.201 --> 14:32.039
Let me guess.
It's about a time machine.
Super original.

14:32.072 --> 14:35.042
You're right.
Because this is the original.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.677
H.G. Wells invented
the time machine.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.080
And by invented, I don't mean
he actually invented one

14:40.113 --> 14:42.682
and ninjas stole it
and then it exploded.
That didn't happen.

14:42.715 --> 14:47.154
"Adventures of a time traveler
who journeys to an idyllic
new world.

14:47.187 --> 14:50.423
But are things too perfect?"

14:50.457 --> 14:54.027
Oh, I get it.
You're saying it's
just like this town.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.695
No. That is actually not
what I'm saying.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.697
Not so bad after all.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.699
Maybe I'll find something
to relate to in here.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.935
Actually, no-- oh.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.107
Congrats.
You're a librarian.

15:08.741 --> 15:12.279
Don't get me wrong.
Dewey was an absolute genius
in his time,

15:12.312 --> 15:16.083
but he did not foresee the need
for more categories based
on general information.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.617
Am I right?

15:17.650 --> 15:20.653
- ( camera shutter clicks )
- ( applause )

15:24.424 --> 15:25.525
Come on up, guys.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.367
Here you go.

15:34.401 --> 15:35.402
Yeah.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.638
( chuckles )

15:42.642 --> 15:45.278
Yes, I do want
to adopt kittens.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.547
Audubon Society, score!
Yes!

15:47.580 --> 15:50.283
- We meet every second Tuesday.
- Oh.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.253
Last month we spotted
a Pacific loon.
( chuckles )

15:53.286 --> 15:55.422
- Wow.
- You know, you've, uh,

15:55.455 --> 15:57.424
done quite a bit here
in the past few days.

15:57.457 --> 16:01.428
I just get so excited,
and once I get excited,
I just can't stop.

16:01.461 --> 16:05.332
Well, it's impressive work,
especially considering
you're a newcomer.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.500
Uh, where did you say
you were from?

16:07.534 --> 16:08.668
Oh, Portland.

16:08.701 --> 16:11.138
You worked
at the Portland library?

16:11.171 --> 16:13.040
We have a branch there, yes.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.242
That a poster for the festival?
I am so looking forward to it.

16:15.275 --> 16:18.378
I was thinking maybe the library
could have a booth there showing
the town history.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.780
- We'd use some of the things
from the display case--
- No, these, uh,

16:20.813 --> 16:23.316
are posters
for the town hall meeting
in a few days.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.018
- Oh.
- You should come.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.220
Civic engagement
keeps our property values high.

16:27.254 --> 16:28.621
- I will.
- ( laughter )

16:28.655 --> 16:30.257
Would you like me
to help you hang those?

16:30.290 --> 16:31.291
Okay.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.497
Hey, you know, um...

16:37.530 --> 16:40.600
Karla's--
she's taken a liking to you.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.269
She taken a liking
to you, too.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.404
- ( chuckles )
- You should ask her on a date.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.606
They tell me
fortune favors the bold.

16:46.639 --> 16:50.343
Well, I've--
I've never been bold.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.512
( flinches )

16:52.545 --> 16:54.547
What is it?

16:56.216 --> 16:58.418
Nothing. I--

16:59.752 --> 17:03.056
You know, I forgot I had
a council meeting.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.491
Oh, I can finish this up.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.127
I-- you know what?
You really are a go-getter.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.129
( chuckles )

17:19.739 --> 17:21.708
This is a problem.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.177
( glass cracks )

17:36.123 --> 17:38.525
I find quilting to be
so soothing, don't you?

17:38.558 --> 17:42.562
A series of micropatterns
repeated with targeted
variation.

17:42.595 --> 17:46.533
( sighs )
This quilt is going to auction
for top dollar at the festival.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.337
Oh, Sylvia, you, uh,
missed a stitch.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.107
Right there.

17:54.141 --> 17:57.710
Okay, I-I think that's enough
quilting for today.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.713
You have a customer.

18:00.747 --> 18:01.748
( chuckles )

18:09.356 --> 18:11.858
Oh, I need to check out
these books.

18:11.891 --> 18:14.294
I knew you'd find
what you were looking for here.

18:14.327 --> 18:17.230
- More than you know.
- ( chuckles )

18:17.264 --> 18:21.401
"Stepford Wives," "The Lottery"
by Shirley Jackson,

18:21.434 --> 18:25.338
I see we're going with
a fiction thriller theme.

18:25.372 --> 18:28.475
Yeah, I don't think
it's that fictional.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.543
You know what I mean?

18:30.577 --> 18:32.245
No.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.381
What do you mean?

18:34.414 --> 18:35.415
( exhales deeply )

18:39.219 --> 18:41.921
What did Freddy want?

18:41.954 --> 18:44.257
He was just, uh,
checking out some more books.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.460
What kind of books?

18:47.494 --> 18:49.362
Something's been going on
with him lately,

18:49.396 --> 18:52.565
and I think it might have
something to do with you.

18:52.599 --> 18:55.568
( stammers )
Me? No.

18:55.602 --> 18:58.871
No, I-I-I just told him
that if he was bored,

18:58.905 --> 19:00.640
he should try reading
something.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.310
Yes, and now he's asking me
all kinds of questions.

19:03.343 --> 19:06.213
Like, uh, how can there be
no traffic accidents?

19:06.246 --> 19:08.481
Why don't we have
a fire department?

19:08.515 --> 19:12.485
Which, come to think of it,
are perfectly legitimate
questions.

19:14.321 --> 19:18.891
You don't know what our life
was like before.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.961
Everything was hard.
I used to...

19:21.994 --> 19:23.930
jump at the littlest thing.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.765
You know, a dozen locks
on the door.

19:25.798 --> 19:26.899
It didn't help.

19:26.933 --> 19:30.203
But here
everything is safe.

19:30.237 --> 19:33.440
We're part of the community.

19:33.473 --> 19:36.276
And Freddy is better off here
whether he wants to admit it
or not.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.749
I'm sure you don't mean
anything by it,

19:42.782 --> 19:46.219
but do us both a favor
and don't put any ideas
into my son's head.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.730
I know my mom
talked to you.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.999
She doesn't like
when I ask questions.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.801
Especially ones
she can't answer.

20:03.970 --> 20:07.374
It wasn't my intention
to cause problems with you
and your mom.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.542
She just wants
what's best for you.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.911
"The too-perfect security
of the Upper-worlders

20:11.944 --> 20:15.782
had led them
to a slow movement
of degeneration."

20:15.815 --> 20:17.384
You know what that means?

20:17.417 --> 20:19.986
That things are never
as good as they seem.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.554
You have to look closer.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.723
Freddy, I am thrilled

20:23.756 --> 20:25.525
that you are getting
into these books.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.961
But, you know, it doesn't mean
that anything's going on.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.463
Havenport's perfect.

20:30.497 --> 20:32.265
Yeah.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.934
And no one is asking why.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.436
Where are we-- what?

20:38.838 --> 20:41.040
Freddy,
where are you taking me?

20:41.073 --> 20:43.676
What is this?

20:43.710 --> 20:45.678
What have you been doing?

20:45.712 --> 20:47.046
When we first moved here,

20:47.079 --> 20:49.316
I noticed odd things
about Havenport.

20:49.349 --> 20:52.552
Just like you.
I mean, my mom wrote it off
as me not fitting in,

20:52.585 --> 20:56.623
but I knew I was right.
So I dug into town history.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.658
- What did you find?
- A lot.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.394
Did you know that no one
has died in Havenport
in nearly 30 years?

21:01.428 --> 21:04.464
That's admittedly strange,
but, I mean, it's explainable.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.533
The nearest hospital
is in Victorville, so...

21:06.566 --> 21:09.802
And there hasn't been
a catastrophic weather event
in all that time, either.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.938
Are you seriously basing
your theories on predicting

21:11.971 --> 21:14.407
where tornados should be?
'Cause that's not--

21:14.441 --> 21:16.075
I've gone through
nationwide statistics

21:16.108 --> 21:19.312
on accident rates,
insurance claims,
property damage.

21:19.346 --> 21:22.982
- Havenport has zero.
- Zero? Well, that's
mathematically impossible.

21:23.015 --> 21:26.819
- Exactly.
- No, I mean, your math's
probably a little off.

21:26.853 --> 21:31.758
( mumbling )
There's no way this data can
account for certain variables

21:31.791 --> 21:35.762
such as the--
the conscientiousness of
a population like Havenport.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.564
It's--

21:37.597 --> 21:39.499
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

21:40.967 --> 21:44.337
Nothing.
Just like I said, nothing.

21:44.371 --> 21:45.972
Nothing happened.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.007
And that's just not
mathematically impossible,

21:48.040 --> 21:51.744
that's impossible
impossible.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.746
( scoffs )

21:53.780 --> 21:56.516
Here's my map of all the places
I took pictures of it happening.

21:56.549 --> 21:57.717
Or not happening.

21:58.885 --> 22:00.520
See what not happening?

22:00.553 --> 22:02.855
Any time someone
might get hurt,

22:02.889 --> 22:06.393
it always looks
like it's gonna happen,
but then it doesn't.

22:06.426 --> 22:10.062
Only in Havenport.
Never anywhere else.

22:10.096 --> 22:13.065
Wait, Cassandra!
Wait! Hold up!

22:13.099 --> 22:15.368
Some sort of barrier
just over the town.

22:15.402 --> 22:16.703
a protective spell
or an enchantment,

22:16.736 --> 22:18.471
but what kind of artifact
would do that?

22:18.505 --> 22:20.540
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing is going on.

22:20.573 --> 22:22.575
- Nothing at all.
- Why are you trying so hard
to ignore this?

22:22.609 --> 22:24.544
Because I want to ignore it,
okay? Because I want to feel
safe.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.746
Things aren't okay
just because you want
them to be.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.115
My mom is afraid
all the time.

22:29.148 --> 22:33.085
I can't go to the next town over
because she's afraid
of how unsafe it is.

22:33.119 --> 22:35.455
That didn't go away
just because we moved here.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.590
It got buried.

22:37.624 --> 22:40.693
That's just your mom.
Freddy.

22:40.727 --> 22:43.763
It's not just my mom.
It's everyone.

22:43.796 --> 22:44.997
- Just look around you.
- ( band playing )

22:45.031 --> 22:46.633
Decorations look lovely.

22:46.666 --> 22:47.800
Thanks!

22:47.834 --> 22:50.002
Gonna be a great festival.

22:50.036 --> 22:53.906
- ( grunts )
- ( clanging )

22:53.940 --> 22:58.811
- Oh!
- ( screaming )

22:58.845 --> 23:00.713
( groaning )

23:00.747 --> 23:04.083
( people clamoring )

23:04.116 --> 23:06.118
( grunting )

23:07.787 --> 23:09.789
( tires screeching )

23:11.057 --> 23:12.058
( crashing )

23:15.995 --> 23:17.764
( indistinct chatter )

23:17.797 --> 23:20.733
So much for a town
where no one can get hurt.

23:25.472 --> 23:28.475
( indistinct chatter )

23:30.643 --> 23:33.846
People, there is
no need to panic.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.883
No need to panic?
John broke his leg!

23:36.916 --> 23:39.852
- All: Yeah!
- And while that's unfortunate--

23:39.886 --> 23:41.588
That's never happened before.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.990
The emergency room
wasn't even open.

23:44.023 --> 23:46.058
- ( all shouting in agreement )
- It hasn't been open in years.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.661
- All: Yeah!
- Everything will be fine.

23:48.695 --> 23:52.865
We're getting someone out here
to fix the hydrant in time
for the festival.

23:52.899 --> 23:56.869
How could we have a festival?
Our safety record is a crock!

23:56.903 --> 24:00.239
- All: Yeah!
- How can the quilting bee
go on?

24:00.272 --> 24:02.975
- Needles are dangerous!
- All: Yeah!

24:03.009 --> 24:06.045
- We need to be protected!
- All: Yeah!

24:06.078 --> 24:08.481
The town council
is looking into all of that.

24:08.515 --> 24:11.851
The town council hasn't done
diddly-squat in decades.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.620
( all shouting in agreement )

24:13.653 --> 24:16.523
Now, people!
Everybody, please.

24:16.556 --> 24:18.791
All I know is I moved here
with my son

24:18.825 --> 24:20.192
because I thought
this was a safe place.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.828
And now I just want
someone to tell me

24:21.861 --> 24:24.731
that everything's going
to be okay again.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.766
And it will be.

24:26.799 --> 24:31.638
I swear everything is going
to be exactly as it was.

24:31.671 --> 24:32.739
How?

24:40.046 --> 24:42.281
Uh, Councilman?

24:42.314 --> 24:44.617
If I may.

24:44.651 --> 24:49.255
Uh, the fact that your town
went without an accident
for so long

24:49.288 --> 24:51.157
is a statistical phenomenon.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.860
( stammers )
A statistical phenomenon?

24:53.893 --> 24:59.031
Yeah, um, I happen
to have some experience
with statistical phenomena.

24:59.065 --> 25:01.067
At my old job,
for a lack of a better term,

25:01.100 --> 25:02.969
we referred to them
as anomalies.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.837
They usually have a cause.

25:04.871 --> 25:09.642
Um, so 10,000 days
is approximately 27.4 years.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.144
So can anyone tell me
an event or an occurrence

25:12.178 --> 25:14.781
that might have happened
around then that could have
influenced this phenomena?

25:14.814 --> 25:16.883
- ( crowd murmuring )
- Anyone?

25:16.916 --> 25:19.251
No? Okay.

25:19.285 --> 25:22.722
Can anyone think of an object
or piece of jewelry,

25:22.755 --> 25:24.323
some might call it
an artifact,

25:24.356 --> 25:26.793
that's turned up recently?

25:26.826 --> 25:28.828
I can think of something
that turned up recently.

25:28.861 --> 25:32.198
Yes! Good! What?

25:32.231 --> 25:34.867
- You.
- Me?

25:34.901 --> 25:38.137
I don't, uh,
no, it's not me.
( chuckles )

25:38.170 --> 25:42.642
Um, no, I-I don't--
No. Um, I'm just like you guys.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.143
I just want everything
to go back to normal.

25:44.176 --> 25:47.847
You do have experience
with statistical phenomena.

25:49.782 --> 25:52.118
Yes.

25:52.151 --> 25:56.322
Because I read about it
in a book.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.891
Which I should go get
for you.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.359
I should leave
and go get that.

26:00.392 --> 26:03.062
I will, uh, do that
and be-- excuse me, sorry--

26:03.095 --> 26:04.764
back in a jiff.
Uh...

26:04.797 --> 26:08.134
I will grab that book
and I will be right back.

26:08.167 --> 26:10.703
- I will be as quick as I can.
Don't you worry.
- ( crowd murmuring )

26:10.737 --> 26:12.905
- Oh, come on, come on.
- Jenkins: Hello?

26:12.939 --> 26:15.307
- Jenkins?
- Jenkins: Miss Cillian?

26:15.341 --> 26:18.144
- Ca-- can you hear me?
- Jenkins: No, I can't.
Miss-- gonna try the mirror.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.346
- Oh, okay.
- ( static ) Miss Cillian?

26:20.379 --> 26:22.915
- Can you hear me?
- Jenkins, thank goodness.
I need your help.

26:22.949 --> 26:24.784
Fishsticks!

26:24.817 --> 26:28.020
- Why?
- Who was that?

26:28.054 --> 26:29.956
There was an old guy
in the mirror.

26:29.989 --> 26:32.992
I was trying to call
for a door out of here,
but the connection died.

26:33.025 --> 26:36.195
Of course.
The barrier makes it a dead zone
for magic as well.

26:36.228 --> 26:37.997
Why do you have a suitcase?

26:38.030 --> 26:40.066
What-- are you running away?

26:40.099 --> 26:43.002
Freddy, they think
I did this.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.403
I can't solve this
on my own.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.973
( exhales deeply )
You're not on your own.

26:47.006 --> 26:49.742
I think I found something.
Come with me.

26:52.411 --> 26:55.815
All right, you said the town
was protected by a barrier.

26:55.848 --> 26:59.051
So I went through
all my pictures to see
if I could see it.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.353
- Did you?
- No.

27:01.387 --> 27:04.356
But I saw something else.

27:12.364 --> 27:16.035
That lens flare
is on every pic.

27:16.068 --> 27:19.271
That's not a lens flare.
Uh, we need to see it closer.

27:19.305 --> 27:22.842
- Can you zoom in at all?
- Yeah.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.276
What is that?

27:24.310 --> 27:26.746
A fairy.
( chuckles )

27:26.779 --> 27:28.781
It's a fairy.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.850
Only one problem,
I don't know anything
about fairies.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.284
I mean, I know a little bit.
I met one once.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.755
You met a fairy?

27:35.788 --> 27:37.423
I have the basics.
Uh, they don't like iron.

27:37.456 --> 27:39.759
They have an aristocratic
social structure, but I don't--

27:39.792 --> 27:41.293
I don't have the specifics.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.862
But we do have a library.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.731
You're right.

27:44.764 --> 27:47.033
Come on.

27:47.066 --> 27:49.702
( crowd murmuring )

27:49.736 --> 27:54.006
I told you she was strange.
No one's that good at quilting.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.175
- Let's check my house next.
- Come on, let's go.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.880
- Let's hit the books.
- What are we looking for?

28:00.913 --> 28:04.150
Anything about fairies.
Come.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.953
Luckily, fairies made it
into human folklore,
so we know more about them.

28:06.986 --> 28:10.456
They like nature, tidiness,
and shiny things.

28:10.489 --> 28:12.224
And there are a lot
of different types of them.

28:12.258 --> 28:15.361
Pixies, sprites, brownies,
leprechauns.
( chuckles )

28:15.394 --> 28:18.430
No way to figure out
which one is helping the town.

28:18.464 --> 28:22.034
You know, that's another thing.
I don't think fairies are
naturally altruistic,

28:22.068 --> 28:24.136
so why is one helping
Havenport?

28:24.170 --> 28:26.072
Well, maybe we can ask it.

28:26.105 --> 28:29.175
Look, this book says,
if you see a fairy ring,
fairies are nearby.

28:29.208 --> 28:32.444
There are rings of trees
and mushrooms like this
all over the woods.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.914
So we must be near
a fairy grove.

28:34.947 --> 28:39.318
So, we go to the woods,
find the fairy ring,
and maybe find the fairy.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.521
- ( door opens )
- ( crowd murmuring )

28:42.554 --> 28:45.124
We don't have time
for maybes.

28:45.157 --> 28:47.326
I think I've got
a better idea.

28:47.359 --> 28:50.362
( sighs )
Are you sure about this?

28:50.396 --> 28:53.465
Only one way to find out.

28:53.499 --> 28:57.203
The magnetic display
in the children's science area
had all of these iron filings.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.438
Since fairies
are allergic to iron,

28:59.471 --> 29:03.976
should be able to slow it down
enough so that we can see it
and follow it.

29:04.010 --> 29:07.847
But if the barrier
is breaking down,
what if the fairy doesn't come?

29:07.880 --> 29:11.317
Then, ouch.
Ready?

29:11.350 --> 29:15.154
Three, two, one.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.225
There it is! The fairy!
Go!

29:19.258 --> 29:22.228
( grunting )

29:22.261 --> 29:23.362
Follow it! Follow it!

29:25.331 --> 29:27.834
- Freddy: Where is it going?
- Cassandra: I don't know!

29:27.867 --> 29:29.235
Where she belongs.

29:34.373 --> 29:38.978
Councilman Weeks,
you trapped the fairy?

29:39.011 --> 29:41.280
I was a boy.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.182
My friends had left me
in the woods.

29:43.215 --> 29:45.952
I was scared.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.454
And I tripped.

29:48.487 --> 29:52.992
And there she was.
She was stuck.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.461
I freed her.

29:55.494 --> 30:01.267
And because I freed her,
she said she would grant me
one wish.

30:01.300 --> 30:05.938
My dad,
there had been a car accident.

30:05.972 --> 30:11.110
"I want my father back,"
I said to her.

30:11.143 --> 30:15.414
But she said she couldn't
undo the past.

30:15.447 --> 30:19.085
So I thought, make everything
better for the future.

30:20.586 --> 30:25.491
I wished no one
got hurt anymore.

30:25.524 --> 30:29.228
I wish-- I wish that no one
got hurt anymore.

30:35.101 --> 30:37.369
Ever since then...

30:37.403 --> 30:40.606
she's protected the town.

30:40.639 --> 30:44.043
No one gets hurt here.

30:45.377 --> 30:48.180
So the globe started
to crack.

30:48.214 --> 30:50.216
And the magic's failing.

30:50.249 --> 30:53.152
Only since you showed up.

30:53.185 --> 30:57.356
You must have
done something.

30:57.389 --> 31:01.560
No, I didn't.
I just came through the--

31:01.593 --> 31:04.530
the door.

31:04.563 --> 31:08.434
I used a magical port of entry.
It must have punctured
the barrier.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.204
This is my fault.

31:12.238 --> 31:15.507
Then only you can fix it.

31:15.541 --> 31:18.945
No, I can't.
Nor should I.

31:18.978 --> 31:19.946
Yes!

31:19.979 --> 31:22.014
You'll go away.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.350
The town...

31:24.383 --> 31:26.485
Karla...

31:26.518 --> 31:30.256
they will believe
in Havenport again.

31:30.289 --> 31:32.258
Everything's going
to be okay.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.061
Things aren't okay just
because you want them to be.

31:36.262 --> 31:37.563
Go! Go!

31:37.596 --> 31:39.265
Go! Go! Go!

31:43.102 --> 31:44.937
There she is!
Get her!

31:44.971 --> 31:47.073
It's okay.
Everybody calm down.

31:47.106 --> 31:48.607
Why did you do this
to us?

31:48.640 --> 31:50.042
Oh, she didn't do anything.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.143
Freddy, get away from her.

31:51.177 --> 31:52.478
Listen to your mother, son.

31:52.511 --> 31:54.680
You're not my father!

31:54.713 --> 31:56.648
And you don't get
to play nice with me.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.985
Now that I know the truth,
this is your fault.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.653
- Don't be hysterical.
Cassandra--
- No, this is your fault,

32:01.687 --> 32:03.922
and I'll prove it.

32:07.659 --> 32:11.097
- No, Freddy!
- No!

32:11.130 --> 32:13.265
What is that?

32:13.299 --> 32:18.004
It's a fairy.
It's been stopping accidents
in Havenport for 27 years.

32:18.037 --> 32:21.040
27 years of servitude.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.209
Years I was forced
to stop

32:23.242 --> 32:27.579
you foolish humans
from your own misdeeds,

32:27.613 --> 32:30.416
soothe your scraped knees,

32:30.449 --> 32:31.717
and fix your mistakes.

32:31.750 --> 32:36.188
And now,
I have 27 years

32:36.222 --> 32:39.125
of pain to give.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.126
( screaming )

32:40.159 --> 32:41.427
( crowd reacting )

32:41.460 --> 32:44.263
- ( screaming )
- ( crowd screaming )

32:50.269 --> 32:52.538
Come on!

32:52.571 --> 32:56.608
- ( all screaming )
- Ahh!

33:05.517 --> 33:08.087
She's going to destroy
the town

33:08.120 --> 33:10.322
and it's all your fault!

33:10.356 --> 33:12.624
I only wanted people
to be safe.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.227
I didn't mean
for any of this.

33:17.196 --> 33:18.430
Karla, please.

33:21.700 --> 33:26.738
You did this.
No one else is responsible.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.644
Hey, hey, hey.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.147
Everyone is responsible.

33:35.181 --> 33:38.517
You all knew there was something
strange about Havenport.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.787
But you decided to look
the other way and accept it.

33:41.820 --> 33:44.523
Being the safest town
in America was more important

33:44.556 --> 33:46.325
than acknowledging
what was going on.

33:48.194 --> 33:49.695
It's everybody's fault.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.665
You're right, sweetie.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.435
I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you.

33:56.468 --> 33:57.636
( glass shattering)

34:01.373 --> 34:03.642
( hisses )

34:04.643 --> 34:06.545
She's coming!

34:06.578 --> 34:08.514
Brace the doors!

34:08.547 --> 34:11.450
- ( crowd reacting )
- Brace the doors!

34:11.483 --> 34:16.255
( indistinct chatter )

34:16.288 --> 34:20.292
- Freddy: Cassandra!
- Karla: What do we do?
How do we stop her?

34:20.326 --> 34:22.794
- Woman: Cassandra?
- Man: Cassandra! Cassandra!

34:22.828 --> 34:25.264
Cassandra, you're the only one
who can save us.

34:25.297 --> 34:27.366
- Cassandra!
- Cassandra!

34:27.399 --> 34:29.535
- Both: Help us!
- Man: Cassandra!

34:29.568 --> 34:31.403
( heavy breathing )

34:34.440 --> 34:37.143
( whimpering )
I can't.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.811
- Cassandra, if you don't
figure this out...
- Stone: we're gonna die.

34:39.845 --> 34:41.447
Cassandra!

34:41.480 --> 34:44.116
- Man: Cassandra.
- You know all about magic.

34:44.150 --> 34:45.651
- Cassandra!
- Cassandra!

34:45.684 --> 34:47.219
- Jenkins: Cassandra.
- Stone: Cassandra, we need you!

34:47.253 --> 34:49.788
- Come on, Cassandra!
- Cassandra! Hurry!

34:49.821 --> 34:52.558
- Cassandra! Cassandra!
- Jenkins: Cassandra.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.226
- Cassandra!
- Cassandra!

34:54.260 --> 34:55.761
- Ezekiel: We need you!
- Stone: We need some help here!

34:55.794 --> 34:58.564
Cassandra. Cassandra.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.267
Have you come to any conclusions
about what you want?

35:01.300 --> 35:04.170
What you want to be?

35:04.203 --> 35:07.373
What do you want to be?

35:07.406 --> 35:09.508
I want to be a Librarian.

35:12.711 --> 35:14.380
Gazebo.

35:16.382 --> 35:17.716
Cassandra, are you okay?

35:17.749 --> 35:19.551
The gazebo...

35:19.585 --> 35:21.620
in the town square,
is it made out of wrought iron?

35:21.653 --> 35:24.456
Yes, I think so.

35:24.490 --> 35:27.793
Okay. The fairy,
if we can get her
into the gazebo

35:27.826 --> 35:30.662
at the size she is now,
she'll be trapped inside.

35:30.696 --> 35:33.699
Then maybe-- maybe then we'll
be able to reason with her.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.301
How do we get her
to fly in there?

35:36.568 --> 35:37.603
I'll do it.

35:40.639 --> 35:43.175
I'm the one who trapped her.

35:43.209 --> 35:44.410
It's me she wants.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.812
So how do we get him
in the gazebo?

35:49.448 --> 35:51.183
I have a plan.

36:07.266 --> 36:09.635
Here we go.

36:09.668 --> 36:12.638
( screaming )

36:12.671 --> 36:15.207
- Now!
- Hey! Hey!

36:15.241 --> 36:17.209
Hey! Over here!

36:17.243 --> 36:18.877
Say cheese.

36:20.746 --> 36:22.614
( groans )

36:22.648 --> 36:23.982
Now!

36:24.015 --> 36:25.651
Hey!

36:26.885 --> 36:29.355
Oh! Ahh!

36:29.388 --> 36:30.622
- Ahh!
- Now!

36:30.656 --> 36:32.324
( cymbals clanging )

36:32.358 --> 36:34.660
( groans )

36:34.693 --> 36:38.497
Hey! Why are you wasting
your time with them?

36:38.530 --> 36:40.699
I'm the one who caught you,
remember?

36:40.732 --> 36:42.434
I'm the one you want.

36:42.468 --> 36:45.437
You!

36:45.471 --> 36:48.474
( screaming )

36:53.945 --> 36:54.946
( grunts )

36:58.550 --> 36:59.985
What is this?

37:00.018 --> 37:02.621
It's iron...
on all sides.

37:04.390 --> 37:07.393
We need to talk to you
as soon as you calm down.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.027
Calm down?

37:09.060 --> 37:12.398
I have been held captive
by a boy for decades.

37:12.431 --> 37:15.334
Yes, you've been
held captive by a boy,

37:15.367 --> 37:19.438
by a scared little boy...

37:19.471 --> 37:23.742
who is now a scared man
living in a scared town.

37:23.775 --> 37:25.043
Scared?

37:25.076 --> 37:28.514
Everyone here knows fear.

37:28.547 --> 37:31.417
I came here
because I was afraid.

37:31.450 --> 37:34.586
I don't feel fear.

37:34.620 --> 37:38.056
What I feel is...
anger.

37:38.089 --> 37:41.627
And now you will all pay,

37:41.660 --> 37:44.963
starting with this one.

37:44.996 --> 37:48.334
Okay. Okay.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.368
But aren't you forgetting
something?

37:49.401 --> 37:50.469
What?

37:50.502 --> 37:52.371
You owe Freddy a wish.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.375
He broke the snow globe.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.510
He set you free.

37:58.544 --> 37:59.745
- ( hisses )
- Come on.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.580
And so you owe him a wish.

38:01.613 --> 38:03.949
Fine. Make it quick.

38:03.982 --> 38:07.386
I have an entire town
to punish.

38:10.356 --> 38:12.324
I wish...

38:12.358 --> 38:14.092
you knew what it was like
to feel afraid.

38:14.125 --> 38:17.829
( scoffs )
That's ridiculous.
What good would--

38:19.097 --> 38:20.399
( gasps )

38:20.432 --> 38:23.435
( whimpering )

38:26.572 --> 38:28.807
What is this?

38:28.840 --> 38:31.477
( whimpering )

38:31.510 --> 38:33.512
Don't come any closer!

38:33.545 --> 38:37.416
That cold shiver...

38:37.449 --> 38:38.550
that's fear.

38:40.419 --> 38:41.820
Sometimes it freezes us.

38:41.853 --> 38:44.823
Sometimes it makes us
do horrible things.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.027
Mostly,
we just live with it.

38:49.060 --> 38:52.964
If this is what
it's like to be human,

38:52.998 --> 38:54.800
this...

38:54.833 --> 38:57.903
this is punishment enough.

38:57.936 --> 39:00.005
You're returning
to your natural size,

39:00.038 --> 39:01.807
and you won't be
affected by the iron.

39:01.840 --> 39:02.908
You're free to go.

39:05.811 --> 39:08.814
( crowd cheering )

39:13.619 --> 39:17.523
Hey! Hey!
You're going the wrong way!

39:17.556 --> 39:19.791
Since I've taken over
the town council,

39:19.825 --> 39:22.394
our priority
is public safety.

39:22.428 --> 39:24.029
First up,
fire department.

39:24.062 --> 39:25.964
No vacation for me.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.467
Okay, so you have your inhaler,
you have your phone.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.502
- Yes, Mom.
- Okay, and you're going
to call me--

39:30.536 --> 39:33.605
Yeah, when I get there,
when the movie's over,
and if anything happens.

39:33.639 --> 39:35.941
Good. And be home
before dinner, okay?

39:35.974 --> 39:38.544
( exhales deeply )
Do you really have to go?

39:38.577 --> 39:40.579
Yeah.

39:40.612 --> 39:44.550
But I have a feeling
we'll be seeing each other again
in a couple of years.

39:44.583 --> 39:45.817
Keep your eyes open
for a letter from us.

39:45.851 --> 39:48.186
( chuckles )
Deal. Bye, Mom.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.422
- Bye, Cassandra.
- Both: Bye.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.660
Was that really so hard?

39:54.693 --> 39:57.195
- That was so hard.
- ( laughing )

39:57.228 --> 39:59.030
It'll get easier.

39:59.064 --> 40:02.834
I don't know how
I'll ever forgive myself
for not believing him.

40:02.868 --> 40:08.006
Well, I think maybe we could all
benefit from a little bit
of forgiveness.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.610
( sighs )

40:11.643 --> 40:13.512
If you ever decide
to visit,

40:13.545 --> 40:14.880
you'll always
have a home here.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.147
Thank you.

40:20.218 --> 40:21.587
( chuckles )

40:24.490 --> 40:27.826
- Nice specs.
- Oh!

40:27.859 --> 40:29.661
Conforming to
my new reality.

40:29.695 --> 40:33.499
Human ingenuity
in the face of conflict

40:33.532 --> 40:35.834
or obstacles,
always commendable.

40:35.867 --> 40:38.637
You can say that again.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.038
You missed all the fun.

40:40.071 --> 40:41.740
I should have come
to your aid.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.108
I apologize.
I didn't reali--

40:43.141 --> 40:46.778
It's okay.
Turns out I came to my own aid.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.246
Ah, may I?

40:48.279 --> 40:49.915
Ah, thank you.

40:51.750 --> 40:54.920
If I've learned anything,
it's that you can't avoid risk.

40:54.953 --> 40:58.924
Might as well do something
with your life that makes
that risk worthwhile.

40:58.957 --> 41:02.127
Although,
I did enjoy my time

41:02.160 --> 41:04.663
being a librarian
with a little L just a bit.

41:04.696 --> 41:07.132
So much for normal.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.835
What?
What is that smile?

41:09.868 --> 41:14.906
I just glad that you realized
what we all have clearly known.

41:14.940 --> 41:16.708
You are anything
but normal.

41:16.742 --> 41:18.744
Thank goodness for that.
