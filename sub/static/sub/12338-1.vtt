00:58.976 --> 01:00.603
<i>Mutants...</i>

01:00.769 --> 01:03.739
<i>born with extraordinary abilities...</i>

01:04.647 --> 01:08.949
<i>and yet, still, they are children
stumbling in the dark...</i>

01:09.111 --> 01:10.784
<i>searching for guidance.</i>

01:12.406 --> 01:15.330
<i>A gift can often be a curse.</i>

01:16.493 --> 01:20.794
<i>Give someone wings,
and they may fly too close to the sun.</i>

01:22.749 --> 01:25.002
<i>Give them the power of prophecy...</i>

01:25.168 --> 01:27.512
<i>and they may live in fear
of the future.</i>

01:28.171 --> 01:30.265
<i>Give them the greatest
gifts of all...</i>

01:31.091 --> 01:33.685
<i>powers beyond imagination...</i>

01:34.428 --> 01:38.183
<i>and they may think they're meant
to rule the world.</i>

01:53.780 --> 01:59.958
En Sabah Nur.

03:19.700 --> 03:23.170
Now you will rule for eternity, my lord.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.344
Sleep.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.275
Let the transference begin.

05:14.064 --> 05:16.066
Death to the false god.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.762
Protect him!

08:20.291 --> 08:23.841
As everyone knows, the existence
of mutants was first discovered...

08:23.920 --> 08:28.096
during the Paris Peace Accords,
after the Vietnam War in 1973.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.265
Six days later, we all watched
as one of those mutants...

08:33.346 --> 08:35.519
Erik Lehnsherr, attacked the President...

08:35.682 --> 08:38.231
and the Cabinet on the lawn
of the White House.

08:38.393 --> 08:42.364
Their lives were saved
by a young mutant who stopped him.

08:42.522 --> 08:46.572
Now, Lehnsherr escaped and became
the world's most-wanted fugitive.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.328
And as for her,
she disappeared as well.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.660
But she has become the symbol
of a new age...

08:51.823 --> 08:54.246
the face of a world
that will never be the same again.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.082
You winking at my girl?

08:57.203 --> 08:58.329
Your girl?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.458
I guess you do look old enough
to be her father.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.672
Excuse me, gentlemen...

09:03.835 --> 09:06.634
is there something you'd like
to share with the rest of the class?

09:06.796 --> 09:08.514
Can I please go to the bathroom?

09:08.673 --> 09:10.833
I think there's something
seriously wrong with my eyes.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.348
Fine, Scott.
And afterwards...

09:12.510 --> 09:15.072
why don't you stop by the principal's
office and explain to him...

09:15.096 --> 09:16.496
that you're disrupting class again?

09:17.849 --> 09:19.567
I trust you know the way.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.103
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.898
No, hang on! Hang on!

09:27.692 --> 09:28.739
Hey!

09:28.902 --> 09:31.155
Now, I know most of you were, what?

09:31.321 --> 09:33.039
Around seven years old
at that time?

09:43.541 --> 09:44.963
Summers!

09:46.294 --> 09:48.592
I know you're in here.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.053
What, are you crying?

09:52.008 --> 09:53.408
I haven't even kicked your ass yet.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.852
Summers! You want to eyeball my girl?

10:45.520 --> 10:46.520
Yeah!

10:46.563 --> 10:48.156
Ten fights waged.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.699
Ten fights won.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.576
The Winged Warrior.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.578
The Bird of Prey.

10:53.736 --> 10:54.988
The Angel of Death.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.573
ANGEL!

10:56.906 --> 10:57.998
Yeah!

11:03.246 --> 11:06.295
Let's hear it for the fat man!

11:06.833 --> 11:09.256
Our next challenger...

11:09.586 --> 11:10.929
comes straight...

11:11.254 --> 11:14.258
from the Munich Circus.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.383
Ladies and gentlemen,

11:17.093 --> 11:20.188
the only one that could take on an Angel...

11:20.263 --> 11:21.606
is the Devil himself.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.859
I give you...

11:25.768 --> 11:27.190
the amazing...

11:27.854 --> 11:29.231
the fantastic...

11:30.106 --> 11:32.404
NIGHTCRAWLER!

11:52.128 --> 11:52.879
Caution

11:53.046 --> 11:54.514
High voltage!

11:54.756 --> 11:56.850
Sorry mutants!

12:11.981 --> 12:13.198
Hey.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.242
Did you get lost little mouse?

12:15.360 --> 12:16.737
The fight is over there.

12:19.822 --> 12:20.822
Fight!

12:20.907 --> 12:22.159
Or they'll kill us both!

12:25.245 --> 12:26.838
And it's about to get exciting.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.166
Ah, you mean this?

12:50.103 --> 12:51.946
Nightcrawler!

12:56.651 --> 12:59.029
Nightcrawler! Nightcrawler!

12:59.195 --> 13:00.037
I'm sorry.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.322
I'm sorry!

13:42.071 --> 13:43.163
They went that way!

13:49.245 --> 13:50.245
You can...

13:50.997 --> 13:51.998
transform.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.374
You're her.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.793
- The hero.
- I'm nobody.

13:54.959 --> 13:55.960
I'm not a hero.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.127
Let's get out of here.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.034
Have a good night, Henryk.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.453
You too, Milosz.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.184
Hi Honey.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.643
Hi.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.150
Good day?

15:00.316 --> 15:01.488
Better now.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.194
Where's Nina?

15:03.361 --> 15:05.614
Out back. With her friends.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.648
Where did you learn that song, Papa?

15:38.229 --> 15:40.357
I learned it from my parents.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.363
And they learned it from their parents.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.362
And them from theirs.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.664
And one day...

15:49.031 --> 15:51.375
you'll sing it to your children, too.

15:53.077 --> 15:54.374
What happened to them?

15:54.537 --> 15:55.754
Your parents.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.377
They were taken from me...

16:01.878 --> 16:03.380
when I was a little boy.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.260
But they're still here.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.265
Inside.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.060
And here.

16:15.391 --> 16:16.392
With you.

16:16.893 --> 16:20.067
Is someone going to take you away?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.404
Never.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.417
I guess we're more alike than we thought.

16:41.584 --> 16:42.961
He won't listen to us.

16:43.461 --> 16:44.929
He's just... He's being...

16:45.087 --> 16:46.179
Scott.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.510
Let me try.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.984
<i>Smells pretty old in here.</i>

17:07.068 --> 17:08.694
Is this a school or a museum?

17:08.778 --> 17:11.452
One more. And last one.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.082
There you go.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.242
I'll see you guys.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.378
<i>Watch where you're going.</i>

17:26.546 --> 17:27.547
I can't.

17:28.839 --> 17:29.840
Who are you talking to?

17:30.007 --> 17:31.007
Me.

17:33.177 --> 17:34.429
I just heard you in my head.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.019
I'm telepathic. I read minds.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.182
Well, stay out of mine.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.469
I don't need some weird girl
creeping around in there.

17:41.269 --> 17:43.021
Don't worry, Scott.
There's not much to see.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.483
Hey, wait.
I didn't tell you my name.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.196
No, you didn't.

17:49.277 --> 17:50.574
Alex Summers?

17:51.320 --> 17:52.663
Hank McCoy!

17:52.822 --> 17:55.541
Whoa! What happened to the
big, blue, furry you'?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.498
I keep him under control now.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.413
This is my brother, Scott.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.083
Hey, Scott. I'm Hank McCoy.
I'm one of the teachers here.

18:05.626 --> 18:06.923
Where's the professor?

18:07.295 --> 18:10.765
"To break forth bloodily,
then the past must be obliterated...

18:11.257 --> 18:13.385
"and a new start made.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.053
"Let us now start fresh...

18:15.219 --> 18:17.142
"without remembrance...

18:17.305 --> 18:21.526
"rather than live forward and backward
at the same time."

18:21.684 --> 18:24.984
Now, what on earth do we think
that the author meant...

18:25.146 --> 18:26.523
when he wrote all that?

18:28.399 --> 18:31.448
That's going to be
your assignment for tomorrow.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.784
Top marks, everyone.
Class dismissed.

18:35.114 --> 18:35.910
Alex.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.075
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

18:38.242 --> 18:39.664
You look well. It's been a while.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.295
It has. Not too bad yourself.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.501
Thank you.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.256
This is my brother, Scott.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.462
Hello, Scott.
Welcome to the School for the Gifted.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.971
Yeah. It doesn't exactly feel like a gift.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.841
It never does, at first.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.938
The first step in
understanding one's power...

18:59.096 --> 19:00.939
is learning the extent of it.

19:01.098 --> 19:04.193
Only then can we begin the process
of teaching you how to control it.

19:04.352 --> 19:07.151
If you do decide to stay,
I can promise you...

19:07.313 --> 19:11.318
that by the time you're done here,
you'll be able to go back into the world...

19:11.484 --> 19:13.244
and play a stable and
productive part in it.

19:13.361 --> 19:14.713
Why don't you take your bandages off...

19:14.737 --> 19:17.286
and we can have a look
at what we're dealing with here?

19:17.448 --> 19:20.748
Alex, would you line him up?
Face him in the right direction, as it were.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.470
There's a target just across the water.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.176
When you open your eyes,
try and hit that.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.427
You can open your eyes, Scott.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.300
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's quite...

19:38.552 --> 19:40.099
Look out! Get back!

19:40.262 --> 19:41.639
Get back! Get back!

19:47.103 --> 19:49.947
My grandfather planted that tree
when he was five years old.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.323
I used to swing...

19:51.482 --> 19:53.530
from the branches of it, myself.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.377
I think that was probably
my favorite tree.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.209
Does that mean I'm expelled?

20:02.368 --> 20:03.585
On the contrary.

20:04.995 --> 20:06.121
You're enrolled.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.173
Do you sell rugs?

20:57.381 --> 20:59.509
You're not allowed in this area.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.393
This rug is for sale?

21:01.677 --> 21:02.677
I said, this...

25:04.670 --> 25:05.670
Earthquake!

25:52.384 --> 25:54.029
Back to bed, please, my darling.
Back to bed.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.054
She's doing it again.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.097
Back to bed, please, everyone.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.390
Jesse, back to bed, please.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.059
Come on now. Spit-spot, back to bed.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.772
Carrie Anne, come on now. Back to bed.

26:10.444 --> 26:12.117
Never seen it like this.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.496
Nor I.

26:14.615 --> 26:16.458
Don't let any of the children
come this way.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.138
Jean.

26:59.660 --> 27:00.660
Jean!

27:03.205 --> 27:04.878
Jean!

27:13.298 --> 27:15.471
I saw the end of the world.

27:16.218 --> 27:17.561
I could feel...

27:17.719 --> 27:19.892
all this death.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.559
It was just a dream.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.398
No, it felt real.

27:25.561 --> 27:26.562
I know.

27:27.062 --> 27:30.191
Your mind is the most powerful
I've ever seen.

27:30.524 --> 27:31.650
It can convince itself...

27:31.817 --> 27:33.535
No, no...

27:33.694 --> 27:35.734
It's not just the mind-reading
or the telekinesis...

27:35.821 --> 27:37.323
it's something else.

27:40.576 --> 27:43.546
Some dark power inside
and it's growing.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.081
Like a fire.

27:46.415 --> 27:47.712
I thought I was getting better.

27:47.875 --> 27:48.922
You are.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.427
You will.

27:51.211 --> 27:52.331
You just have to be patient.

27:52.421 --> 27:55.846
No, no. You don't know what it's like
to be afraid to shut your eyes.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.431
To be trapped inside your own head.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.392
Oh, I think I do.

28:00.888 --> 28:04.267
It wasn't so long ago that
I was plagued by voices, myself.

28:05.225 --> 28:06.727
All their suffering.

28:06.894 --> 28:07.941
All their pain.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.272
Their secrets.

28:13.775 --> 28:16.699
I'm afraid one day
I'm going to hurt someone.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.283
Lie back.

28:31.418 --> 28:34.968
Everyone fears that
which they do not understand.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.643
You will learn to control your powers.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.644
And when you do...

28:42.304 --> 28:44.147
you'll have nothing to fear.

28:46.558 --> 28:48.158
Her nightmares were different this time.

28:48.268 --> 28:51.147
It could account for something I saw
when I was in my lab earlier.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.407
There was some kind of tremor.
Like an energy surge.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.158
I picked it up on one of my meters.

28:55.317 --> 28:57.445
You're saying Jean created it?

28:57.611 --> 28:59.113
No. I'm saying something else did.

28:59.279 --> 29:00.959
Maybe she was reacting to it.
I don't know.

29:01.073 --> 29:02.950
But the epicenter was
halfway around the world.

29:03.116 --> 29:04.242
Halfway around the world?

29:04.409 --> 29:06.137
That's why I was hoping you could
take a look.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.163
Let's see what we can find.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.134
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

29:22.928 --> 29:24.851
Okay, the source came from Cairo.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.358
I'll put in the coordinates.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.710
<i>I gotta get out of here.</i>

29:55.544 --> 29:56.545
<i>Give them a report.</i>

29:59.214 --> 30:00.306
What? What is it?

30:00.465 --> 30:03.890
<i>Something happened here.
I can tell them it's real.</i>

30:05.387 --> 30:06.388
It's her.

30:06.972 --> 30:07.972
Who?

30:09.224 --> 30:10.521
- Moira.
- What?

30:10.684 --> 30:11.901
Moira MacTaggert?

30:12.686 --> 30:14.233
Give me the details.

30:14.396 --> 30:16.319
She looks amazing.
She's barely aged a day.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.070
No. I meant...

30:18.692 --> 30:19.693
What is she doing there?

30:19.860 --> 30:21.180
What does the CIA want with this?

30:21.570 --> 30:24.574
She's going back to Langley
to deliver a report.

30:25.407 --> 30:26.408
I'm going to go there...

30:26.575 --> 30:28.919
see if she knows something
about the tremor.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.249
And you want to go see Moira.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.547
I want to go check her out.
Check out...

30:32.706 --> 30:33.832
the situation.

30:37.586 --> 30:38.587
Moira MacTaggert.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.099
It's like a ghost from the past.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.819
You did a good thing.
You saved that man.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.101
That's not the point.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.250
If I'm exposed, we're all exposed.

30:51.433 --> 30:52.434
We have to go.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.403
This is our home.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.280
This is our daughter's home.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.362
We are her home.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.950
I told you who I was,
the first night I met you.

31:04.446 --> 31:06.119
I trusted you then.

31:06.281 --> 31:08.283
I need you to trust me now.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.462
We can't stay here anymore.

31:16.458 --> 31:17.458
I'll get Nina.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.547
Sweetheart.

31:32.474 --> 31:34.067
She's not in her room.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.648
And I don't see her out back.

31:43.777 --> 31:44.824
Nina?

31:44.986 --> 31:46.238
Nina!

31:46.488 --> 31:47.488
Nina!

31:47.572 --> 31:48.572
Nina!

31:54.287 --> 31:55.664
Nina!

32:16.977 --> 32:18.024
Nina.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.696
Are you alright?

32:19.980 --> 32:21.232
She's fine.

32:21.314 --> 32:22.566
Then let her go!

32:22.649 --> 32:23.821
We will.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.870
We just wanted to have a word

32:29.614 --> 32:31.867
You're not wearing your badges.

32:32.325 --> 32:34.327
No metal.

32:35.162 --> 32:37.836
Some guys at the factory said
they saw something today.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.459
Something that didn't add up.

32:40.542 --> 32:42.135
Put your weapons away.

32:42.210 --> 32:44.633
You've been a good citizen, Henryk...

32:44.880 --> 32:47.053
A good neighbor... a good worker.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.134
I want to believe that's who you are.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.309
It is.

32:50.385 --> 32:53.138
But nobody in this town really knows you.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.768
Yes you do.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.434
I am Henryk Gurzsky.

32:57.642 --> 33:00.020
Jakob, I've had dinner in your home...

33:00.145 --> 33:02.193
And you were lying the whole time.

33:02.439 --> 33:04.612
I brought a killer into my house.

33:06.860 --> 33:09.329
Is this you?

33:13.116 --> 33:16.040
Are you the one they call Magneto?

33:36.306 --> 33:38.479
Take me in.

33:38.975 --> 33:39.771
Please...

33:39.851 --> 33:42.525
Just let my daughter go.

33:52.364 --> 33:53.832
Go with your mother.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.424
Please...!

34:04.584 --> 34:06.336
Don't leave me.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.422
I'm not going to let them take you.

34:09.755 --> 34:10.757
Nina.

34:12.634 --> 34:13.886
Nina.

34:14.803 --> 34:15.804
Nina.

34:16.888 --> 34:17.888
What's going on?

34:18.473 --> 34:19.473
She's one of them?

34:21.851 --> 34:22.851
Tell her to stop!

34:22.893 --> 34:24.521
She can't control it!

34:25.688 --> 34:26.940
She's scared of you!

34:27.274 --> 34:29.150
I'm not going to let them take you!

34:36.449 --> 34:37.574
Make her stop!

34:39.411 --> 34:41.038
Nina! Nina!

35:02.767 --> 35:03.518
Nina.

35:03.685 --> 35:05.608
Nina, Nina, no...

35:05.770 --> 35:07.898
No, please. Please!

35:10.775 --> 35:11.776
Please.

35:12.485 --> 35:13.702
Please.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.504
Not my babies.

35:28.793 --> 35:30.591
Not my babies.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.056
Is this what you want from me?

36:17.967 --> 36:19.435
Is this what I am?

36:27.018 --> 36:28.565
Is this what I am?

37:44.471 --> 37:46.348
You know what we do to thieves.

37:46.973 --> 37:48.225
Pick a hand.

37:48.391 --> 37:49.517
Enough.

37:52.353 --> 37:54.355
If you're with her,
I suggest you walk away.

37:54.606 --> 37:55.983
While you still can.

37:58.693 --> 37:59.693
Walk away

38:01.196 --> 38:05.042
Who rules this world?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.335
What language is that?

38:09.954 --> 38:12.377
Clown-face. What's the deal?

38:12.457 --> 38:13.583
Beat it!

38:29.224 --> 38:30.726
I'm sorry.

38:36.815 --> 38:40.069
You can't feel it, can you?

38:52.372 --> 38:55.125
Now you feel it.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.529
So you really haven't seen her
in all these years'?

39:06.553 --> 39:08.897
You never looked her up?
Not even in Cerebro?

39:09.514 --> 39:12.188
Alex! What do you take me for,
some kind of pervert?

39:12.350 --> 39:14.193
Yes, I looked her up once. Twice.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.945
But not in a long time, all right?

39:16.104 --> 39:18.323
How did you leave things?
Any hard feelings?

39:18.815 --> 39:19.816
Not likely.

39:19.983 --> 39:21.576
Everybody take a break.

39:23.152 --> 39:25.871
I wiped her mind of all memories of us.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.953
The beach, Cuba...

39:28.116 --> 39:29.834
that whole time.

39:29.993 --> 39:31.336
It was so long ago, Alex.

39:31.494 --> 39:33.087
Before the world knew about mutants.

39:33.246 --> 39:36.216
I felt it was the best thing for her.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.589
And for you?

39:40.587 --> 39:43.090
Didn't really matter
what was best for me.

39:46.426 --> 39:48.099
Moira...

39:48.261 --> 39:49.979
MacTaggert, hello!

39:54.809 --> 39:56.152
Allow me to introduce myself.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.109
- I'm Professor...
- Charles Xavier.

39:58.271 --> 40:00.490
- I know exactly who you are.
- You do?

40:00.648 --> 40:01.649
Of course I do.

40:02.317 --> 40:04.820
I have read all of your papers.

40:04.986 --> 40:06.988
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

40:08.156 --> 40:09.156
Moira MacTaggert.

40:09.282 --> 40:10.454
- Alex Summers.
- Have a seat.

40:10.617 --> 40:12.290
Just throw that on the floor.

40:13.661 --> 40:15.379
It's wonderful to see you again.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.666
To meet you again, for the first time.

40:17.832 --> 40:18.833
You've got a son?

40:20.835 --> 40:22.337
Yes.

40:22.503 --> 40:23.755
Does he have a husband?

40:25.965 --> 40:27.308
Do you have a husband?

40:27.467 --> 40:29.435
I had a husband...

40:29.594 --> 40:32.154
but it's hard to do this job
and make it home in time for dinner.

40:32.180 --> 40:33.022
Good, good.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.603
We all make choices, right?

40:35.183 --> 40:37.106
Yes, we do.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.360
- Professor.
- Yes?

40:42.315 --> 40:43.315
Yes.

40:43.524 --> 40:46.027
I was, we were hoping that you would...

40:46.194 --> 40:48.322
tell us about what happened
yesterday in Egypt.

40:49.030 --> 40:51.124
I'm afraid
that's classified information.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.369
I don't mean to be rude...

40:54.994 --> 40:56.541
but how did you get in here?

40:57.121 --> 40:58.873
I have level-five clearance.

41:01.334 --> 41:04.213
Ever since the world found out
about mutants in '73...

41:04.379 --> 41:07.223
there have been cults
who see them as some kind of...

41:07.382 --> 41:09.384
Second Coming or sign of God.

41:09.550 --> 41:10.847
I was tracking one of them.

41:11.552 --> 41:15.056
They call themselves Ashir En Sabah Nur...

41:15.223 --> 41:18.397
named after an ancient being
they believe to be the world's first.

41:18.559 --> 41:19.856
The world's first what?

41:20.019 --> 41:21.396
The world's first mutant.

41:21.729 --> 41:24.323
I thought mutants didn't evolve
until this century.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.826
That's the common theory, yes,
but these guys believe...

41:26.985 --> 41:30.330
that the first mutant was born
tens of thousands of years ago.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.840
And they believe he will rise again.

41:31.864 --> 41:35.243
They've been searching ancient sites
all around the world for clues.

41:36.577 --> 41:37.749
These hieroglyphs...

41:37.912 --> 41:41.883
describe a specific set of powers
greater than any man could possess.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.543
They think he lived all that time?

41:43.710 --> 41:46.509
Yes and no.
They believe he had the ability...

41:46.671 --> 41:48.315
to transfer his consciousness
from body to body.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.819
And whenever he was close to death...

41:49.924 --> 41:51.346
he would just take on a new body.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.549
Some of these may have been
the bodies of mutants...

41:53.678 --> 41:55.430
enabling him to take their powers...

41:55.596 --> 41:57.439
amassing various abilities
over the years.

41:57.598 --> 42:00.272
- An all-powerful mutant.
- Exactly.

42:00.435 --> 42:03.234
And wherever this being was
he always had four...

42:03.396 --> 42:06.240
principle followers.
Disciples.

42:06.399 --> 42:08.276
Protectors he would imbue with powers.

42:08.443 --> 42:09.569
Like the Four Horsemen...

42:10.278 --> 42:11.951
of the Apocalypse.

42:12.113 --> 42:13.706
He got that one from the Bible.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.617
Or the Bible got it from him.

42:16.284 --> 42:17.911
And wherever he ruled...

42:18.077 --> 42:20.956
eventually, it would end in disaster.

42:21.122 --> 42:22.419
Cataclysm.

42:22.582 --> 42:24.630
Some kind of...

42:24.792 --> 42:26.260
Apocalypse

42:27.295 --> 42:29.047
The end of the world.

42:30.757 --> 42:32.634
<i>I must say, Apollo...</i>

42:33.634 --> 42:36.137
<i>the way you ape human behavior
is remarkable.</i>

42:42.643 --> 42:43.690
<i>I am Apollo.</i>

42:43.770 --> 42:46.774
I've never seen another
mutant in this town.

42:47.065 --> 42:48.533
You speak Egyptian?

42:48.691 --> 42:49.691
Arabic?

42:50.151 --> 42:51.277
English?

42:51.444 --> 42:52.991
<i>I'm a scientist.</i>

42:53.154 --> 42:54.497
<i>My particular specialty...</i>

42:54.655 --> 42:55.656
Great fighter.

42:57.742 --> 42:58.914
She's my hero.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.954
I want to be like her.

43:03.498 --> 43:06.502
There's some food here. Not much.

43:06.667 --> 43:07.759
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

43:07.919 --> 43:09.296
<i>You love me.</i>

43:10.171 --> 43:11.172
<i>Love you?</i>

43:12.006 --> 43:13.006
<i>Illogical.</i>

43:13.841 --> 43:16.845
<i>I'm not some simple shepherdess
you can awe.</i>

43:18.179 --> 43:20.477
<i>Why, I could no more love you...</i>

43:20.640 --> 43:23.610
<i>than I could love a new species
of bacteria.</i>

43:24.811 --> 43:26.279
What are you doing?

43:28.189 --> 43:30.362
Learning.

43:38.199 --> 43:41.624
<i>In the streets, there is outrage against
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan...</i>

43:42.120 --> 43:43.263
<i>...in a brotherhood of our kind.</i>

43:43.287 --> 43:44.287
<i>Several demonstrations.</i>

43:45.790 --> 43:48.794
<i>One of them was held in Boston,
and Bruce Morton has the story.</i>

43:48.960 --> 43:52.840
<i>Since the advent of nuclear weapons,
the United States does not start fights.</i>

43:53.464 --> 43:54.716
Weapons.

43:54.882 --> 43:57.635
<i>Never before has man
possessed so much power.</i>

43:57.802 --> 44:00.225
<i>Soviet Union and
United States being superpowers...</i>

44:01.973 --> 44:04.817
Superpowers.

44:05.685 --> 44:07.403
The weak...

44:07.562 --> 44:09.735
have taken the earth.

44:10.398 --> 44:13.447
For this, I was betrayed.

44:13.818 --> 44:16.162
False gods.

44:17.155 --> 44:18.155
Idols.

44:19.907 --> 44:22.626
No more.

44:25.413 --> 44:29.418
I have returned.

44:30.126 --> 44:32.220
<i>A new tomorrow...</i>

44:32.378 --> 44:33.925
<i>that starts today.</i>

44:38.926 --> 44:40.644
Where did you come from?

44:47.518 --> 44:50.772
A time before man lost his way.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.781
Welcome to the '80s.

44:55.985 --> 44:58.784
This world needs to be...

45:00.448 --> 45:02.200
Cleansed.

45:02.992 --> 45:03.992
What?

45:04.911 --> 45:06.413
Saved.

45:08.331 --> 45:10.459
You can't save the world...

45:10.625 --> 45:12.593
just going around killing people.

45:12.752 --> 45:14.425
There's laws, systems in place...

45:14.587 --> 45:15.713
for that kind of thing.

45:18.633 --> 45:19.850
My child...

45:20.009 --> 45:22.637
why do you enslave yourself?

45:27.350 --> 45:29.068
What are you doing?

45:29.227 --> 45:30.820
Making you stronger.

45:32.188 --> 45:34.111
My goddess.

45:40.905 --> 45:41.952
<i>Aphrodite.</i>

45:43.282 --> 45:44.282
<i>You were right.</i>

45:44.408 --> 45:45.580
Yes.

45:49.288 --> 45:50.756
<i>You were right.</i>

45:51.415 --> 45:53.292
<i>The time is past.</i>

45:54.168 --> 45:56.341
<i>There is no room for gods.</i>

46:00.883 --> 46:02.385
Why can't I go with you?

46:02.551 --> 46:04.178
I told you, I work alone.

46:11.269 --> 46:12.566
Wait there.

46:13.938 --> 46:16.032
Always good to see your face.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.237
Even if it's not yours.

46:18.401 --> 46:19.618
Papers and passage for one.

46:21.988 --> 46:24.332
Where's the gentleman going,
if I may ask?

46:24.490 --> 46:25.616
Don't know, don't care.

46:26.575 --> 46:28.775
I just save his life.
What he does with it is up to him.

46:28.953 --> 46:31.456
Mystique, the mercenary.

46:31.622 --> 46:32.874
Don't call me that.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.518
No matter how much you pretend
to be someone else...

46:34.542 --> 46:36.010
Caliban knows who you are.

46:36.168 --> 46:38.341
If there's anything worth knowing
about mutants...

46:38.504 --> 46:40.006
Caliban knows it.

46:40.506 --> 46:41.553
mystique.

46:42.258 --> 46:43.402
Why don't you ask your psychics...

46:43.426 --> 46:45.394
what'll happen to you
if you keep pushing me?

46:45.553 --> 46:46.553
What'll happen?

46:50.850 --> 46:52.648
Psylocke gets a little jealous.

46:54.812 --> 46:56.064
But Caliban likes you.

46:56.230 --> 46:57.482
Caliban likes money.

46:57.648 --> 46:59.525
Caliban likes you so much...

46:59.692 --> 47:01.865
he wants to give you free information...

47:02.028 --> 47:03.996
about an old friend...

47:04.155 --> 47:05.623
from back when you had friends.

47:06.157 --> 47:08.626
Do you remember...

47:08.784 --> 47:10.832
Erik Lehnsherr?

47:11.120 --> 47:13.122
My girls got a flash of him in Poland.

47:13.289 --> 47:15.257
He left quite a few dead bodies
in his wake...

47:15.583 --> 47:18.302
including his wife and daughter.

47:18.794 --> 47:21.468
Should be in the news soon enough...

47:22.089 --> 47:23.729
but Caliban gives you
a little head start.

47:25.468 --> 47:27.436
- How fast are you?
- How fast?

47:27.595 --> 47:29.142
How far can you cover?

47:29.305 --> 47:31.116
As far as I can see
or if I've been there before.

47:31.140 --> 47:32.483
Come with me, Crawler.

47:32.641 --> 47:34.109
Actually, it's Nightcrawler.

47:34.268 --> 47:36.191
And my real name is...

47:37.563 --> 47:39.361
Kurt Wagner.

47:43.527 --> 47:46.121
The lenses are made of
some ruby quartz I had lying around.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.175
They should be able to
refract your optic beams...

47:48.199 --> 47:50.359
and keep them contained
within their own vector fields.

47:50.409 --> 47:51.626
Try them on.

48:06.258 --> 48:06.975
Okay.

48:07.134 --> 48:09.102
Go ahead.

48:09.970 --> 48:11.972
Wait, sorry, no.

48:12.139 --> 48:13.139
Okay.

48:13.182 --> 48:14.222
- Now?
- Yeah, you're good.

48:14.266 --> 48:15.267
All right.

48:19.355 --> 48:20.356
Whoa.

48:21.816 --> 48:23.363
I can see.

48:23.526 --> 48:24.743
Thank you.

48:25.152 --> 48:27.029
Professor, thank you. You're a genius.

48:27.196 --> 48:28.196
No.

48:28.614 --> 48:31.037
I'm not a professor.
I wish...

48:32.827 --> 48:33.828
Who's that?

48:36.664 --> 48:38.337
I believe you two met. That's Jean Grey.

48:38.499 --> 48:39.893
You bumped into her when you arrived.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.840
- Wait, that's her?
- Yeah.

48:47.258 --> 48:48.258
Hey.

48:51.137 --> 48:52.263
You can see.

48:53.681 --> 48:56.025
Yeah. It's not <i>as</i> bad <i>as</i> I thought here.

48:56.183 --> 48:57.183
Freak.

48:57.309 --> 48:58.787
- Someone should warn the new kid.
- Yeah. Someone should tell him.

48:58.811 --> 49:00.108
They're still scared of me.

49:00.521 --> 49:02.364
Hey, I have special glasses now.

49:02.523 --> 49:03.820
They're not scared of you.

49:03.983 --> 49:05.701
They're scared of me.

49:06.277 --> 49:09.622
You're not the only one who
can't fully control your powers.

49:10.614 --> 49:11.615
Wait, so...

49:11.782 --> 49:14.535
last night, when the house shook...

49:15.035 --> 49:16.036
that was you?

49:16.203 --> 49:19.083
Sorry to break it to you, but you're not
the biggest freak in the school.

49:19.790 --> 49:21.633
Well, that's a first.

49:35.514 --> 49:36.857
Raven.

49:41.312 --> 49:42.313
Wow.

49:43.647 --> 49:45.399
I... You're...

49:45.566 --> 49:46.738
Not blue?

49:46.901 --> 49:48.824
Looks like you and I
have that in common, now.

49:48.986 --> 49:51.080
No, no, I meant...

49:52.990 --> 49:54.207
you're back.

49:55.826 --> 49:57.749
Never thought I'd see you here again.

49:59.079 --> 50:00.501
Yeah, me neither.

50:03.834 --> 50:05.211
I'm blue.

50:05.669 --> 50:06.841
I'm Kurt.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.256
Oh, right.

50:08.589 --> 50:09.590
Kurt Wagner.

50:10.591 --> 50:11.591
Welcome.

50:14.887 --> 50:16.355
We're closed.

50:19.892 --> 50:21.894
I knew I felt a chill in the air.

50:24.772 --> 50:25.944
How did you get in here?

50:26.106 --> 50:27.107
We let ourselves in.

50:27.274 --> 50:28.776
We are looking for mutants.

50:28.943 --> 50:32.038
Since you know where to find them,
we came here.

50:32.196 --> 50:33.573
Caliban doesn't know you.

50:34.782 --> 50:37.410
We're looking for the strongest.

50:41.956 --> 50:43.082
Everything all right?

50:43.249 --> 50:44.466
I'm fine, Psylocke.

50:45.251 --> 50:46.969
How much money do you have?

50:47.461 --> 50:48.461
None.

50:49.630 --> 50:51.632
Like Caliban said...

50:51.799 --> 50:53.472
we are closed. Yeah?

50:55.094 --> 50:57.472
I need your help, my child.

50:58.430 --> 51:00.103
You don't look like Caliban's father.

51:00.808 --> 51:02.481
Maybe a little bit up here.

51:10.568 --> 51:12.445
You are all my children...

51:12.611 --> 51:15.956
and you're lost, because you follow
blind leaders.

51:16.782 --> 51:19.126
These false gods...

51:19.493 --> 51:21.996
systems of the weak.

51:22.454 --> 51:24.673
They've ruined my world...

51:25.165 --> 51:26.165
No more.

51:34.842 --> 51:36.685
What do you want?

51:46.520 --> 51:48.022
I want you...

51:48.647 --> 51:51.491
to feel the full reach of your power.

51:57.489 --> 52:00.618
You've only had a taste
of your true strength.

52:00.784 --> 52:02.036
Unlike others...

52:02.202 --> 52:04.546
who seek to control you...

52:05.039 --> 52:07.383
I want to set you free.

52:17.301 --> 52:19.520
I know the kind of mutants
you're looking for.

52:21.722 --> 52:24.066
And I know where to find them.

52:27.811 --> 52:29.313
<i>It's my first time in America.</i>

52:29.480 --> 52:31.357
I'm very excited to see your culture.

52:31.523 --> 52:33.196
Well, you're not gonna see it here.

52:33.359 --> 52:36.159
The only thing American about this place
is that it used to be British.

52:36.695 --> 52:37.742
This is Scott.

52:38.864 --> 52:40.241
He's new here, too.

52:40.407 --> 52:41.927
And I'm already up for a prison break.

52:44.244 --> 52:46.667
What do we say, we take this blue guy
on a little field trip?

52:46.830 --> 52:48.673
I'm sure there's a
mall around here, somewhere.

52:49.249 --> 52:50.421
What's a mall?

52:51.585 --> 52:52.586
What's a mall?

52:52.753 --> 52:55.597
All right, now this is a matter of
national pride. Civic duty.

52:55.756 --> 52:56.848
Scott.

52:57.841 --> 52:59.935
What? You've been cooped up here
for a long time...

53:00.260 --> 53:02.433
and the Professor's not even home.

53:03.222 --> 53:04.599
I'd like to go to the mall.

53:06.934 --> 53:08.106
Try it.

53:08.268 --> 53:09.268
All right.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.442
Where does he keep his cars?

53:26.412 --> 53:28.414
Or should I say "piss off"?

53:33.794 --> 53:34.966
This is the guy?

53:35.212 --> 53:36.634
He used to be.

53:36.797 --> 53:38.891
I didn't know his wings were...

53:42.886 --> 53:44.138
Let's get out of here.

53:44.430 --> 53:45.727
His fighting days are done.

53:46.557 --> 53:48.230
No, they're not.

53:53.939 --> 53:55.156
What the hell is this?

53:58.402 --> 53:59.995
I want to give you something.

54:00.320 --> 54:02.664
There's nothing you can give me
that I want.

54:03.407 --> 54:05.501
Yes, there is.

54:20.299 --> 54:22.301
Yes, my son.

54:36.106 --> 54:37.358
Yes.

54:49.036 --> 54:52.040
Rise, my angel.

54:54.875 --> 54:56.047
Rise.

55:25.948 --> 55:26.949
Wow.

55:29.076 --> 55:32.922
Hypersonic, blast resistant,
stealth technology.

55:33.080 --> 55:34.377
That's impressive.

55:34.873 --> 55:37.217
How are you ever gonna
get it out of here?

55:38.585 --> 55:39.586
Well, that's okay.

55:39.753 --> 55:41.833
I built a retractable roof
into the basketball court.

55:43.215 --> 55:45.309
Hank, you're building a warplane
down here.

55:46.218 --> 55:48.947
After what happened in Washington,
I thought we were going to come back...

55:48.971 --> 55:51.065
and start the X-Men,
like we all used to talk about.

55:51.223 --> 55:52.475
But...

55:52.641 --> 55:54.609
Charles wants students, not soldiers.

55:55.102 --> 55:56.649
And he thinks the best of people.

55:56.812 --> 55:57.904
He has hope.

55:58.272 --> 55:59.444
And you?

56:00.774 --> 56:02.742
You know, I think we should
hope for the best.

56:02.901 --> 56:05.324
And prepare for the worst.

56:06.113 --> 56:07.660
I think the world needs the X-Men.

56:08.991 --> 56:12.586
And maybe now that you're back,
you could help me convince him.

56:12.744 --> 56:13.824
We could start it together.

56:13.912 --> 56:15.164
Hank, I'm here about Erik.

56:16.790 --> 56:18.417
Right. Erik.

56:18.584 --> 56:19.836
Yeah. Of course.

56:20.586 --> 56:21.428
Of course.

56:21.587 --> 56:23.307
I think he might be
in some kind of trouble.

56:23.672 --> 56:24.969
Real trouble.

56:26.633 --> 56:28.101
Isn't he always?

57:02.544 --> 57:04.137
Some of you spoke to the police...

57:04.880 --> 57:08.430
about what you believe
you witnessed here yesterday.

57:11.136 --> 57:12.809
You want to know my powers...

57:14.556 --> 57:16.058
know who I am...

57:17.809 --> 57:19.652
see what I can do?

57:21.897 --> 57:23.365
I'll show you.

57:26.068 --> 57:29.038
Think of the person you love most
in your life.

57:31.406 --> 57:32.658
Your wife.

57:35.494 --> 57:36.746
Mother.

57:39.873 --> 57:41.341
Daughter.

57:45.921 --> 57:49.300
Now that person will know what it is
to lose someone they love.

57:50.300 --> 57:52.849
And live with that pain.

57:54.096 --> 57:55.097
Forever.

57:55.180 --> 57:56.727
Henryk, please.

57:56.932 --> 57:58.058
Don't do this.

57:59.518 --> 58:01.236
My name isn't Henryk.

58:05.315 --> 58:07.943
My name is Magneto.

58:28.422 --> 58:29.924
Who the fuck are you?

58:32.718 --> 58:34.436
Stay back.

58:36.263 --> 58:37.264
Whoever you are...

58:38.390 --> 58:40.563
don't try to stop me
from killing these men.

59:00.037 --> 59:01.789
I'm not here for them.

59:03.790 --> 59:05.337
I'm here for you.

59:22.601 --> 59:24.274
Come and see.

59:57.552 --> 01:00:00.180
This is where your power was born.

01:00:02.724 --> 01:00:05.147
And this is where
your people were slaughtered.

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:22.870
You shouldn't have brought me here.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.414
Why?

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:30.878
Are you afraid to be here?

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:35.303
You can't escape it, Erik.

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:39.052
Who are you?

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:42.439
Elohim, Shen, Ra.

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:46.477
I've been called many names
over many lifetimes.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:50.113
I am born of death.

01:00:50.522 --> 01:00:51.990
I was there to spark...

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:55.119
and fan the flame of man's awakening.

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:57.700
To spin the wheel of civilization.

01:00:57.863 --> 01:00:59.456
And when the forest would grow rank...

01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:01.787
and needed clearing for new growth...

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:06.171
I was there to set it ablaze.

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:09.083
Where were you...

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:11.718
when my father and mother
were slaughtered in this place?

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:12.878
Asleep.

01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:15.680
Trapped in darkness.

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:18.141
I was not there for you, my son.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.553
But I am here now.

01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:24.394
You don't know your own strength,
but I do.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:29.232
Reach down.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:31.108
Feel the metal...

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:33.114
in the ground.

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:36.277
Reach as deep as you can.

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:41.532
You'll find you have the power...

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:44.577
to move the very Earth itself.

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:21.739
Everything they've built will fall!

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:26.623
And from the ashes of their world...

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:31.457
we'll build a better one!

01:02:57.983 --> 01:03:01.829
Lehnsherr was identified yesterday,
in this small town in central Poland.

01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:06.329
<i>Leaders from all communities are urging
their citizens to remain calm.</i>

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:09.836
<i>As police and armed forces
are mobilizing to find Lehnsherr...</i>

01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:11.254
<i>...before he can strike again.</i>

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:14.508
<i>If anyone has information
about Lehnsherr...</i>

01:03:14.666 --> 01:03:16.634
<i>or as he is also known, Magneto...</i>

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:19.296
<i>contact your local authorities
immediately...</i>

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:21.385
<i>and proceed with caution...</i>

01:03:21.548 --> 01:03:23.971
<i>- as he is considered extremely...
Peter.</i>

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:25.635
What's up?

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:30.311
Just checking on you.

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:32.066
I'm good. Playing Pac-Man.

01:03:38.106 --> 01:03:39.506
You sure you weren't watching this?

01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:41.585
<i>This news comes at a time when the world
is celebrating 10 years of peace...</i>

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:43.703
<i>between mutants and mankind.</i>

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:45.614
You're going after him, aren't you?

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:49.418
You wanted me
to get out of the house more, right?

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:52.962
I can't stop you. Nobody can.

01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:55.123
But trust me, this won't end well.

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:57.884
Nothing does with him.

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:03.090
I'm not afraid of him.

01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:05.388
You should be.

01:04:31.326 --> 01:04:33.420
I've read so much about this place.

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:37.127
But being here,
it actually seems kind of...

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:39.384
familiar.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:40.543
Strange.

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:41.836
Quite.

01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:43.129
Shall we?

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:46.846
I'm just saying,
<i>Empire</i> is still the best.

01:04:47.008 --> 01:04:49.557
It's the most complex,
the most sophisticated...

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:51.159
wasn't afraid to have a dark ending.

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:52.865
Yeah, but come on.
If it wasn't for the first one...

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.533
you wouldn't have any of the rest
of the movies.

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:58.061
Well, at least we can all agree,
the third one's always the worst.

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:00.480
Hank. Are you in here?

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:02.240
I'd like you to meet...

01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:05.401
Moira.

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:07.070
Raven.

01:05:07.278 --> 01:05:08.905
I'm sorry, have we met?

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:13.459
Hank, Alex, Agent MacTaggert...

01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:15.258
would you give us just one moment,
please?

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:17.413
Of course.

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:23.772
Charles, why didn't she recognize me?
She knew me in this form.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.639
Well, after you
left me on the beach in Cuba...

01:05:26.798 --> 01:05:29.472
I took her memories of that time.
Have a seat.

01:05:30.343 --> 01:05:32.016
Lucky girl.

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:36.687
It's good to see you, Raven.

01:05:37.016 --> 01:05:39.144
- Welcome home.
- This isn't my home.

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:41.779
It was once.

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.781
No, it was your home.
I just lived here.

01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:46.280
And I barely even recognize it now.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.241
You know, I have plans for this place.

01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:51.205
I mean to turn it into a real campus.

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:52.456
A university.

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.459
Not just for mutants, either,
for humans too.

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:57.996
Living and working...

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:00.714
growing together.

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:02.884
You know, I really believed that once.

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:05.841
I really believed we could change them
after DC.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:07.380
We did.

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:09.515
No, Charles.
They still hate and fear us.

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:12.069
It's just harder to see
because they're more polite about it.

01:06:12.093 --> 01:06:13.345
I got sick of living that lie.

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:16.560
That's why you're not in your
natural blue form.

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:19.772
I'm not gonna be the face of a world
that doesn't exist.

01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:22.566
Things are better.
The world is better.

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:24.276
Maybe in Westchester.

01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:27.067
Out there, mutants are still running...

01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:29.368
hiding, living in fear.

01:06:29.527 --> 01:06:32.326
Just because there's not a war,
doesn't mean there's peace.

01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:34.842
You want to teach your kids something,
teach them that.

01:06:34.866 --> 01:06:36.413
Teach them to fight.

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:38.679
Otherwise they might as well live
in this house for the rest of their lives.

01:06:38.703 --> 01:06:40.876
You still sound just like him.

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:42.712
You sound just like Erik.

01:06:44.959 --> 01:06:46.427
That's why I'm here.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:48.721
He's resurfaced.

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:53.184
He had a wife and a child.

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:54.560
They were killed.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:57.393
Along with a handful of policemen.

01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:02.602
The whole world will be looking for him.

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:05.318
But you can help me find him
before they do.

01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:16.826
Moira, I'm going to have to ask you
to keep this a secret.

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:20.040
I don't even know what this is.

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:21.671
It's Cerebro.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:22.830
The new model.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:24.670
I based the color on...

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:27.961
it doesn't matter.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:47.442
What are those?

01:07:47.605 --> 01:07:49.778
Those are all the humans of the world.

01:07:51.985 --> 01:07:53.953
And these...

01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:56.490
are all the mutants.

01:07:56.656 --> 01:07:58.158
I'm connected to all of their minds.

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:02.124
The CIA would kill for this.

01:08:02.287 --> 01:08:03.914
I know they would.

01:08:06.541 --> 01:08:08.589
Where are you, Erik?

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:41.533
Charles?

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:44.161
Hello, old friend.

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:49.209
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:51.048
I feel your pain.

01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:54.346
And your loss.

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:58.343
You think because you can
see into my head...

01:08:59.093 --> 01:09:01.095
you know how it feels?

01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:04.227
<i>You're looking in the wrong place,
Charles.</i>

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:07.064
What happened to them,
it was terribly wrong.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:10.229
But come back to us.

01:09:10.395 --> 01:09:11.943
<i>I can help you.</i>

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:14.492
Help me?

01:09:15.443 --> 01:09:16.920
Think of your wife,
think of your daughter.

01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:18.571
<i>What would they have wanted?</i>

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:20.365
They would have wanted to live.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:23.501
<i>I tried your way, Charles.</i>

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:27.042
<i>I tried to be like them.</i>

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:29.798
Live like them.

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:34.429
But it always ends the same way.

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:38.761
They took everything away from me.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:43.892
Now...

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:49.519
we'll take everything from them.

01:09:58.152 --> 01:09:59.153
Hank...

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:03.450
he's not alone.

01:10:10.957 --> 01:10:12.379
Extraordinary.

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:15.590
What do you see?

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:20.091
The answer.

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:23.932
Hey, Charles, wait.

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:38.693
Oh, my God.

01:10:39.193 --> 01:10:42.447
Thank you for letting me in.

01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:49.128
Charles, get out!

01:10:50.955 --> 01:10:54.129
I've never felt power like this before.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:55.009
Charles...

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:56.420
Charles, get out of there.

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.179
What's going on? What's happening?

01:10:58.337 --> 01:10:59.337
I think...

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:01.345
Someone's taken over Cerebro.

01:11:01.507 --> 01:11:03.430
- They've taken control of it.
- To do what?

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.513
To connect.

01:11:15.813 --> 01:11:17.611
Always the same.

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:21.699
<i>And now, all this.</i>

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:27.332
<i>No more stones.</i>

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.793
<i>No more spears.</i>

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.885
<i>No more slings.</i>

01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:49.893
<i>No more swords.</i>

01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:52.900
No more weapons!

01:11:53.518 --> 01:11:56.567
<i>No more systems!</i>

01:11:57.396 --> 01:11:59.899
<i>No more!</i>

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:03.410
No more superpowers.

01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:05.993
<i>Charles!</i>

01:12:09.158 --> 01:12:10.250
Hank!

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:29.562
What the hell is going on?

01:12:30.429 --> 01:12:32.022
Who's turning the keys?

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:33.937
The men are.

01:12:34.392 --> 01:12:35.689
Who green-lit the launch?

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:38.108
Hank, do something!

01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:44.027
It won't shut down!

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:49.407
We've lost contact
with all Trident and Polaris subs.

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:51.750
The Air Force is reporting
the same thing.

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:55.209
So much faith in their tools...

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:58.045
and their machines.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:12:59.550
<i>Russia, China...</i>

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:02.428
England, Israel, India.

01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:04.464
Everybody's got nukes in the air.

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:05.631
What's the target?

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:06.890
Where are they going?

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:08.926
Up, straight up.

01:13:09.093 --> 01:13:09.810
Alex...

01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:11.266
- What?
- Destroy it!

01:13:11.429 --> 01:13:13.397
Destroy everything. Destroy Cerebro!

01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:19.395
Wreak havoc!

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.657
You can fire your arrows...

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:29.413
<i>from the Tower of Babel...</i>

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:42.502
but you can never strike God!

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:02.280
Charles, are you okay?

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.294
Erik.

01:14:24.835 --> 01:14:25.836
Charles!

01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:28.338
Alex!

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.131
Hey!

01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:30.967
Hey, asshole!

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:33.306
All will be revealed, my child.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:34.469
Stop!

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:35.720
No!

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:32.731
Wow!

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:39.739
Where did you...

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:42.533
I was looking for the Professor.
I thought he lived here.

01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:47.083
They took him.

01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:50.132
She's the one. It's her.

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:52.251
Are you sure?

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:54.461
Is she gonna help us?

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:05.598
They look up to you.

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:10.685
Right now...

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.612
they need you.

01:18:16.442 --> 01:18:18.115
That's not what they need.

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:21.531
That's awesome!

01:18:29.788 --> 01:18:30.789
What happened?

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:32.048
Where's Alex?

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:33.292
Where's my brother?

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:35.587
Pretty sure I got everybody.

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:40.800
Alex was closest to the blast.

01:18:56.815 --> 01:18:57.816
Alex...

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:21.010
<i>We're one click out.</i>

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:23.767
<i>All right, boys. This is it.</i>

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:28.180
Scott.

01:19:28.347 --> 01:19:31.851
<i>Medical assistance is on the way.</i>

01:19:32.851 --> 01:19:35.104
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:38.366
<i>Medical assistance is on the way.</i>

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:41.361
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:44.701
<i>Medical assistance is on the way.</i>

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:47.203
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:50.043
<i>Medical assistance is on the way.</i>

01:19:53.163 --> 01:19:55.131
Hey! Moira MacTaggert!

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:56.884
CIA! Thank God you're here!

01:20:03.007 --> 01:20:04.007
Wait!

01:20:04.675 --> 01:20:05.675
Fire!

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:12.558
I want her.

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:15.727
Him.

01:20:17.396 --> 01:20:18.522
Him.

01:20:25.571 --> 01:20:27.915
- And her.
- Yes, sir.

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:32.870
Leave the kids.

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:41.507
- What do we do?
- Keep quiet.

01:20:43.255 --> 01:20:45.383
X-Ray 7, I'm doing a final sweep
of the ground.

01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:56.018
Let's get them on the bird!

01:20:56.185 --> 01:20:57.186
Clear!

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:06.116
Thanks, Jean.
We gotta help them.

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:08.878
- Kurt, can you get us in that thing?
- You want to get in there'?

01:21:09.073 --> 01:21:10.199
What if the soldiers see us?

01:21:10.366 --> 01:21:12.039
Don't worry, they won't see us.
Trust me.

01:21:14.411 --> 01:21:15.411
Hold on.

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:33.472
Kurt, get us all out of here!

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.483
I can't!

01:21:36.642 --> 01:21:40.146
When they closed the doors,
there's some kind of electrical field.

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:41.564
It's like Berlin all over.

01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:43.416
Jean, get in the pilots' heads.
Don't let them take off.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.614
I can't. I can't reach the pilots.
I can't reach anyone.

01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:56.503
<i>We're also getting reports
out of Europe and Asia.</i>

01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:58.835
<i>This was not just a U.S. phenomenon.</i>

01:21:58.997 --> 01:22:03.173
<i>It seems the entire world
has been disarmed of nuclear weapons.</i>

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:04.813
<i>The Pentagon has confirmed
multiple launches...</i>

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:07.181
<i>from Russia, as well as
the UK, Israel and China.</i>

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:08.682
- Look!
- Look up there!

01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:11.344
<i>So far, there has been no response
from the White House.</i>

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:14.514
<i>Eyewitness reports have been pouring in
from affiliates across the globe.</i>

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:18.355
<i>Authorities are not sure
if it was an act of peace or an act of war.</i>

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:27.192
Our dear Father...

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:29.786
hold me in the light of God.

01:22:34.533 --> 01:22:36.376
It should have been me.

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:41.006
He was the one that was
gonna do something with his life.

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:42.708
He was always the one.

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.178
That's not how he felt.

01:22:47.004 --> 01:22:50.725
He felt you were the one that was gonna
do something special with your life.

01:22:51.884 --> 01:22:54.979
That you were gonna
make a difference in the world.

01:22:56.138 --> 01:22:58.357
Maybe even change it.

01:22:58.891 --> 01:23:01.064
How do you know what he felt?

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:04.397
I know what everybody feels.

01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:22.461
Hold me in the light of God.

01:23:23.207 --> 01:23:25.710
Protect me from danger.

01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:28.883
<i>Save me by Your command.</i>

01:23:30.214 --> 01:23:32.091
<i>Listen to my prayer.</i>

01:23:33.175 --> 01:23:35.018
<i>And keep me safe.</i>

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:12.552
You're blocking me.

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:13.715
How?

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:16.180
I can shield their minds
from your power.

01:24:16.343 --> 01:24:19.813
It's one of the many gifts I've acquired
throughout the millennia.

01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:22.600
But to see...

01:24:22.766 --> 01:24:24.313
inside a mind...

01:24:24.476 --> 01:24:26.695
to control it...

01:24:27.938 --> 01:24:29.485
that's your gift.

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:33.194
You saw it, didn't you?

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.454
The glory of what's to come.

01:24:36.446 --> 01:24:38.326
You're going to take part
in all this killing...

01:24:39.658 --> 01:24:41.706
and destruction?

01:24:42.244 --> 01:24:43.496
It's all I've ever known.

01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:45.335
No, it isn't.

01:24:45.706 --> 01:24:46.832
You've just forgotten.

01:24:46.999 --> 01:24:48.922
No, Charles, I remember.

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:52.800
Your way doesn't work.

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:55.970
I've shown him a better way.

01:24:56.133 --> 01:24:57.430
A better world.

01:24:57.593 --> 01:25:00.688
No, you've just tapped into his rage
and pain. That's all you've done.

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:04.563
I told you from the moment I met you,
there is more to you, Erik.

01:25:04.725 --> 01:25:07.353
There is good in you, too.

01:25:07.519 --> 01:25:10.318
Whatever it is you think
you saw in me, Charles...

01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:14.322
I buried it...

01:25:14.484 --> 01:25:17.283
with my family.

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:29.957
What?

01:25:30.417 --> 01:25:31.794
What's wrong with you?

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.883
Is that going to happen
to all of us?

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:35.880
No, I just...

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:37.216
left my meds in the house.

01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:39.301
What happened? Where are we?

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:40.468
Hey!

01:25:41.011 --> 01:25:42.012
<i>Hello, Mystique.</i>

01:25:42.262 --> 01:25:43.605
<i>Major Stryker.</i>

01:25:43.764 --> 01:25:44.764
Colonel Stryker.

01:25:44.848 --> 01:25:46.976
I wouldn't get too close to the wall,
if I were you.

01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:49.236
<i>It may create some discomfort.</i>

01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:51.988
I'm Moira MacTaggert.
I'm a senior officer at the CIA.

01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:54.275
<i>I know who you are, Agent MacTaggert.</i>

01:25:54.441 --> 01:25:56.159
You cannot keep me here, in this...

01:25:56.318 --> 01:25:57.535
Actually, I can.

01:25:57.694 --> 01:26:01.619
<i>A psychic event just destroyed
every nuke from here to Moscow.</i>

01:26:01.782 --> 01:26:05.503
<i>That event emanated from exactly
where we found you.</i>

01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:08.130
<i>At the home of the world's
most powerful psychic.</i>

01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:11.212
So, you are going to tell me,
where is Charles Xavier?

01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:14.378
It's not him
you should be worried about.

01:26:14.544 --> 01:26:17.639
There's someone else.
Someone more powerful.

01:26:18.298 --> 01:26:21.393
<i>If you let us out of here,
we can help you.</i>

01:26:22.469 --> 01:26:25.063
Do you really expect me to believe that?

01:26:25.597 --> 01:26:28.271
<i>You can put on any face that you want,
but I know who you are.</i>

01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:29.810
<i>What you are.</i>

01:26:35.232 --> 01:26:36.859
Hey, Moira.

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.777
What did you mean when you said...

01:26:38.944 --> 01:26:40.821
someone more powerful than Charles?

01:26:43.073 --> 01:26:44.793
Once they finish these,
we'll go from there.

01:26:51.498 --> 01:26:52.920
What's taking so long?

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:54.209
I can't get in.

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:57.050
They have a field around it,
like the helicopter.

01:26:57.254 --> 01:26:59.302
There's gotta be a way to cut the power.

01:26:59.464 --> 01:27:00.465
<i>Charles...</i>

01:27:00.841 --> 01:27:02.935
you will send a message...

01:27:03.093 --> 01:27:04.766
to every living mind.

01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:08.683
You will tell them
that this earth will be laid waste.

01:27:08.849 --> 01:27:10.601
That it is I, En Sabah Nur...

01:27:10.767 --> 01:27:12.485
who will wreak this upon them.

01:27:19.151 --> 01:27:20.778
Now...

01:27:20.944 --> 01:27:23.948
deliver my message.

01:27:24.114 --> 01:27:25.912
Even if I wanted to...

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:28.577
I couldn't reach that many people.
I don't have Cerebro.

01:27:32.122 --> 01:27:33.590
You don't need a machine...

01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:36.172
to amplify your powers.

01:27:37.043 --> 01:27:39.091
You have me.

01:27:52.142 --> 01:27:54.770
Guys, that could be our way out of here.

01:27:59.149 --> 01:28:00.992
You know him'? Magneto?

01:28:02.569 --> 01:28:03.912
I used to.

01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:06.118
Not so sure anymore.

01:28:06.615 --> 01:28:08.333
What was he like?

01:28:08.492 --> 01:28:11.496
Was he like they say he was?
Was he...

01:28:13.163 --> 01:28:14.380
the bad guy?

01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:15.631
No.

01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:19.720
I mean, yeah. He was...

01:28:21.838 --> 01:28:24.557
Why do you care so much?
You see his speech on TV or something?

01:28:25.008 --> 01:28:27.386
Yeah, but...

01:28:31.556 --> 01:28:33.058
He's my father.

01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:34.351
What?

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:36.526
- Him and my mom, they did it.
- No, I know...

01:28:36.937 --> 01:28:38.063
Are you sure?

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:41.109
Yeah. He left my mom before I was born.

01:28:41.525 --> 01:28:42.697
I met him 10 years back...

01:28:42.859 --> 01:28:44.327
but I didn't know it was him.

01:28:44.486 --> 01:28:47.114
By the time I figured it out,
it was too late.

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:49.620
Then, this week I saw him on TV again...

01:28:49.783 --> 01:28:52.286
and I came to that house,
looking for him...

01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:54.671
but by the time I got there...

01:28:56.957 --> 01:28:58.254
Late again.

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:02.588
For a guy who moves as fast as me...

01:29:02.754 --> 01:29:04.973
I always seem to be too late.

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:07.809
Let's hope not this time.

01:29:08.885 --> 01:29:09.727
Yeah.

01:29:09.886 --> 01:29:10.933
Seriously.

01:29:11.096 --> 01:29:12.096
<i>Hear me...</i>

01:29:12.222 --> 01:29:13.895
<i>inhabitants of this world.</i>

01:29:15.267 --> 01:29:16.894
- What is that?
<i>- This is a message.</i>

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:18.607
I think it's the Professor.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:22.616
<i>A message to every man, woman,
and mutant in the world.</i>

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:25.618
You have lost your way.

01:29:26.528 --> 01:29:28.576
You have lost your way.

01:29:28.738 --> 01:29:30.160
But I have returned.

01:29:31.241 --> 01:29:33.869
But I have returned.

01:29:34.744 --> 01:29:37.338
<i>The day of reckoning is here.</i>

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:40.425
<i>All your buildings...</i>

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:44.596
...all of your towers and temples...

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:46.639
Will fall.

01:29:46.965 --> 01:29:52.472
And the dawn of a new age will rise.

01:29:52.804 --> 01:29:54.284
...for there <i>is</i> nothing you can do...

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:56.649
<i>- Jean.
- ...to stop what is coming.</i>

01:29:58.018 --> 01:30:01.397
<i>Jean, if you can hear me,
focus on my voice.</i>

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:03.941
<i>Cairo.
Find us, Jean.</i>

01:30:04.107 --> 01:30:05.529
<i>Find us. Cairo. Find us.</i>

01:30:06.526 --> 01:30:09.450
<i>This message is for one reason alone.</i>

01:30:09.613 --> 01:30:11.832
To tell the strongest among you...

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:15.961
Those with the greatest power...

01:30:16.119 --> 01:30:19.544
this earth will be yours.

01:30:20.373 --> 01:30:22.546
Those with the greatest power...

01:30:25.545 --> 01:30:27.218
protect those without.

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:33.144
That's my message to the world.

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:39.355
How was Charles doing that
without Cerebro?

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:42.024
Sir, what was that voice?

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:44.230
<i>I know that voice.</i>

01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:45.949
<i>It's Xavier, isn't it?
What's going on?</i>

01:30:46.107 --> 01:30:47.825
- We don't know!
- We don't know, bro!

01:30:48.735 --> 01:30:49.827
He just spoke to me.

01:30:49.986 --> 01:30:52.080
I think he spoke to everyone.

01:30:52.238 --> 01:30:53.660
- I could hear him, too.
- No, no...

01:30:53.823 --> 01:30:55.496
he just sent me a hidden message.

01:30:55.659 --> 01:30:57.161
One he knew only I would hear.

01:30:58.036 --> 01:30:59.083
I know where they are.

01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:00.830
Hey!

01:31:02.248 --> 01:31:04.342
<i>We have shots fired!
Where's it coming from?</i>

01:31:05.835 --> 01:31:07.337
I have intruders in Quad Six.

01:31:09.464 --> 01:31:11.432
Send a security team.
Take them out.

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:21.401
The generator. It's worth a shot.

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:23.436
Kurt?

01:31:44.958 --> 01:31:47.461
There's some kind of animal in there.

01:31:50.588 --> 01:31:53.057
It's no animal.

01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:54.759
It's a man.

01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:56.636
Who is he?

01:31:58.054 --> 01:32:00.307
That part of him <i>as</i> been taken away.

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:02.726
What do you mean?

01:32:02.892 --> 01:32:06.317
I mean they turned him into
some kind of weapon.

01:32:11.651 --> 01:32:14.120
<i>Charlie Three, report.
Did you find them?</i>

01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:26.791
Shut it down.

01:32:50.774 --> 01:32:51.774
Fire!

01:33:02.452 --> 01:33:03.954
Weapon X is loose!

01:33:04.496 --> 01:33:06.919
I repeat, Weapon X is loose!

01:33:09.334 --> 01:33:10.881
You sure he's not an animal?

01:33:15.715 --> 01:33:18.844
- He's into the central halls.
<i>- Engaging target Sector Five.</i>

01:33:19.594 --> 01:33:20.594
<i>We can't...</i>

01:33:36.861 --> 01:33:37.862
Hey!

01:33:58.591 --> 01:34:00.191
- What are they doing?
- What's going on?

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:02.645
<i>- I just lost feed.
- Hey! What's going on here?</i>

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:05.644
I'll be right back.

01:34:08.852 --> 01:34:09.899
No!

01:34:26.786 --> 01:34:29.539
Hey! Stay where you are!

01:34:48.808 --> 01:34:49.808
Scott, wait.

01:34:52.437 --> 01:34:53.780
<i>I can help you.</i>

01:34:59.777 --> 01:35:01.029
Jean.

01:35:39.651 --> 01:35:41.619
<i>Logan.</i>

01:36:29.534 --> 01:36:31.036
What'd you do to him?

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:36.003
I found a piece of his past
and gave it back to him.

01:36:36.332 --> 01:36:38.710
Just the few memories I could reach.

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:42.972
I hope that's the last we've seen
of that guy.

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.401
Kurt.

01:37:06.195 --> 01:37:07.538
- What?
- What?

01:37:07.697 --> 01:37:08.698
Hey.

01:37:13.745 --> 01:37:16.089
<i>Stay away from the...</i>

01:37:16.247 --> 01:37:17.247
The what?

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:18.757
The do-...

01:37:18.916 --> 01:37:20.088
<i>Stay away from the...</i>

01:37:20.251 --> 01:37:21.377
Get away from the door!

01:37:21.544 --> 01:37:22.545
<i>On three.</i>

01:37:22.712 --> 01:37:24.931
One... two...

01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:39.437
We know where the Professor is.

01:37:39.604 --> 01:37:41.081
I think we might have a way out of here.

01:37:41.105 --> 01:37:44.029
- Well, you've been busy.
- We had a little help.

01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:46.109
Let's go!

01:37:49.364 --> 01:37:50.365
Jesus!

01:37:50.531 --> 01:37:51.532
Oh, sorry!

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:52.871
This way!

01:38:02.293 --> 01:38:04.796
This was meant to be
the center of the universe...

01:38:04.962 --> 01:38:06.714
before I was betrayed.

01:38:06.881 --> 01:38:08.474
Now...

01:38:08.633 --> 01:38:09.976
it will be.

01:39:30.715 --> 01:39:31.841
Nice.

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:35.352
Hey, Hank, do you think
you can fly this thing?

01:39:35.803 --> 01:39:37.646
Yeah, I can figure it out.

01:39:39.015 --> 01:39:40.015
Hey, guys.

01:39:41.309 --> 01:39:42.856
Flight suits.

01:39:46.689 --> 01:39:48.691
You got your warplane.

01:39:48.858 --> 01:39:50.235
Let's go to war.

01:39:57.492 --> 01:39:59.244
A gift...

01:39:59.410 --> 01:40:01.333
from the past you left behind...

01:40:02.538 --> 01:40:05.257
and the future that lies ahead.

01:40:06.667 --> 01:40:10.171
You will reach down, my son.

01:40:10.338 --> 01:40:12.466
Deep into the earth.

01:40:12.632 --> 01:40:15.886
Rip everything they've
built from the ground.

01:40:16.052 --> 01:40:18.646
Wipe clean this world.

01:40:18.804 --> 01:40:22.354
And we will lead those that survive...

01:40:22.517 --> 01:40:25.316
into a better one.

01:40:25.728 --> 01:40:27.275
And me?

01:40:28.439 --> 01:40:31.033
Am I to play a role in this madness?

01:40:32.735 --> 01:40:36.365
You have the most important role of all.

01:40:47.667 --> 01:40:49.385
Were you scared?

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:51.845
That day in D.C., were you scared?

01:40:52.004 --> 01:40:53.004
No.

01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:01.894
But I was scared on my first mission.

01:41:02.265 --> 01:41:04.313
I was on a plane like this
with my friends.

01:41:04.725 --> 01:41:06.068
About your age.

01:41:09.689 --> 01:41:11.942
We called ourselves the X-Men.

01:41:13.401 --> 01:41:14.903
Your brother was there.

01:41:15.444 --> 01:41:16.821
We used to call him Havok.

01:41:17.363 --> 01:41:19.286
He was a real handful...

01:41:21.242 --> 01:41:23.836
but when it came down to it,
he was very brave.

01:41:26.163 --> 01:41:28.837
What happened to the rest of the kids
who went with you?

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.172
The X-Men?

01:41:32.962 --> 01:41:34.760
Hank and I are the only ones left.

01:41:35.881 --> 01:41:37.724
I couldn't save the rest of them.

01:41:38.718 --> 01:41:40.720
I told you, I'm not a hero.

01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:43.097
Well, you're a hero to us.

01:41:43.806 --> 01:41:45.558
Seeing you that day on

01:41:45.725 --> 01:41:46.977
changed my life.

01:41:47.518 --> 01:41:48.610
Mine, too.

01:41:49.645 --> 01:41:50.646
Mine, too.

01:41:52.523 --> 01:41:56.073
I still live in my mom's basement
but, you know...

01:41:56.235 --> 01:41:57.908
everything else is...

01:41:59.655 --> 01:42:01.578
It's pretty much the same.

01:42:03.451 --> 01:42:04.828
I'm a total loser.

01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:07.268
What we're seeing is
a magnetic phenomenon...

01:43:07.431 --> 01:43:10.025
on a much larger scale
than what we saw at Auschwitz.

01:43:10.309 --> 01:43:12.732
The ground is full of magnetic elements.

01:43:12.895 --> 01:43:14.522
Iron, nickel, cobalt.

01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:17.067
The ocean's floor
is lined with them, too.

01:43:17.233 --> 01:43:19.907
It's already begun at the lowest depths.

01:43:20.069 --> 01:43:23.198
Land masses will slow it,
but not for long.

01:43:23.364 --> 01:43:26.208
Eventually, cities, urban centers...

01:43:26.367 --> 01:43:28.620
anything built since the Bronze Age...

01:43:28.786 --> 01:43:30.083
Will be wiped away.

01:43:30.246 --> 01:43:31.806
The death toll will be in the billions.

01:43:31.831 --> 01:43:34.209
He's talking about
the whole goddamn world.

01:44:23.549 --> 01:44:24.801
You're just another false god.

01:44:25.843 --> 01:44:28.141
And whoever's left to follow you
when this all over...

01:44:28.304 --> 01:44:31.399
they will betray you again.

01:44:33.601 --> 01:44:35.524
You're wrong, Charles.

01:44:35.936 --> 01:44:39.531
For the first time
in a thousand lifetimes...

01:44:39.690 --> 01:44:41.192
I have you.

01:44:41.692 --> 01:44:47.290
For all my gifts, I have yet
to possess the one I needed most.

01:44:47.948 --> 01:44:49.165
To be...

01:44:49.909 --> 01:44:51.832
everywhere.

01:44:54.872 --> 01:44:56.044
To be...

01:44:56.832 --> 01:44:58.084
everyone.

01:45:13.891 --> 01:45:15.814
Seventh wonder, twelve 0' clock.

01:45:24.068 --> 01:45:26.070
He has the Professor
in the center of the pyramid.

01:45:27.238 --> 01:45:30.617
He's going to transfer his consciousness
into the Professor.

01:45:30.783 --> 01:45:31.783
If he does that...

01:45:32.159 --> 01:45:35.129
he'll have the power
to control every mind in the world.

01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:44.342
What the hell is that?

01:45:45.256 --> 01:45:46.428
It's Erik.

01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:58.318
You guys help Nightcrawler
get into the pyramid.

01:46:00.271 --> 01:46:02.820
Get Charles. I'll take care of Erik.

01:46:02.982 --> 01:46:04.780
How are we gonna get through that?

01:46:05.609 --> 01:46:06.781
I can get you in there.

01:46:07.444 --> 01:46:08.991
I came here for him. Let me help you.

01:46:10.364 --> 01:46:13.004
The rest of you, get Charles on this
plane and get him out of here.

01:46:13.117 --> 01:46:14.957
- We're not leaving without you!
- Don't worry.

01:46:15.703 --> 01:46:16.703
We'll catch up.

01:46:16.954 --> 01:46:18.046
Hold on.

01:46:48.652 --> 01:46:49.869
Hank, you go with the kids.

01:46:50.029 --> 01:46:52.327
- Moira will be waiting on the plane.
- Wait.

01:46:52.656 --> 01:46:53.657
What?

01:46:53.824 --> 01:46:56.168
Not all of us can
fully control our powers.

01:46:56.660 --> 01:46:58.003
Then don't.

01:46:58.329 --> 01:47:00.002
You need to embrace them.

01:47:03.334 --> 01:47:04.426
We all do.

01:47:28.442 --> 01:47:31.366
Go. Join the others.

01:47:31.528 --> 01:47:34.702
Protect me,
until the transference is complete.

01:47:59.890 --> 01:48:01.392
There's an entrance. It's clear.

01:48:05.729 --> 01:48:07.322
Kurt! Get in there!

01:48:18.242 --> 01:48:19.585
In the pyramid! Move!

01:48:20.327 --> 01:48:21.328
Go!

01:48:57.823 --> 01:48:58.949
Split them up.

01:49:22.639 --> 01:49:23.640
Professor...

01:49:27.644 --> 01:49:28.816
Kurt, you have to hurry!

01:49:28.979 --> 01:49:31.152
I'm trying. It's like a maze in here.

01:49:41.492 --> 01:49:42.493
Kurt, no!

01:50:08.018 --> 01:50:10.299
The magnetic field is too strong.
I can't get us in there.

01:50:12.856 --> 01:50:13.948
Erik!

01:50:21.198 --> 01:50:22.199
mystique.

01:50:26.537 --> 01:50:29.461
I know you think you've lost everything.

01:50:30.249 --> 01:50:31.717
But you haven't.

01:50:33.293 --> 01:50:35.387
You have me.

01:50:35.712 --> 01:50:37.464
You have Charles.

01:50:43.554 --> 01:50:46.228
You have more family than you know.

01:50:47.391 --> 01:50:50.065
You never had the chance
to save your family before.

01:50:51.228 --> 01:50:52.901
But you do now.

01:50:55.566 --> 01:50:58.069
That's what I've come here to tell you.

01:51:03.448 --> 01:51:05.075
And you?

01:51:13.917 --> 01:51:15.590
I'm your...

01:51:19.923 --> 01:51:22.267
I'm here for my family, too.

01:52:11.516 --> 01:52:13.359
Get out. Get out!

01:52:13.518 --> 01:52:14.815
Get out!

01:52:21.693 --> 01:52:23.161
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

01:52:34.748 --> 01:52:36.170
We're losing him.

01:52:52.349 --> 01:52:53.349
I'll be right back.

01:53:04.403 --> 01:53:05.700
Scott, glasses on!

01:53:15.706 --> 01:53:16.706
Let's go!

01:53:33.557 --> 01:53:35.059
- Locked on.
- Here we go.

01:53:52.909 --> 01:53:54.081
Psylocke!

01:54:10.427 --> 01:54:11.644
What the hell was that?

01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:19.436
Kurt.

01:54:19.770 --> 01:54:21.210
Everyone, grab hold of Nightcrawler!

01:54:21.271 --> 01:54:22.749
I've never done it
with this many people.

01:54:22.773 --> 01:54:23.773
Get us out of here.

01:54:39.623 --> 01:54:40.795
Kurt, hurry!

01:54:42.376 --> 01:54:43.376
Kurt!

01:55:09.403 --> 01:55:10.905
Charles...

01:55:16.326 --> 01:55:17.326
Is he okay?

01:55:17.828 --> 01:55:20.081
It's his energy. He's drained.

01:55:21.498 --> 01:55:22.499
Get out.

01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:24.342
Get out!

01:55:24.501 --> 01:55:26.845
Professor, it's okay.
You're with us.

01:55:27.921 --> 01:55:29.343
It's okay.

01:55:38.014 --> 01:55:40.642
I'm going to fight
for what I have left.

01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:45.988
Are you?

01:55:58.827 --> 01:56:01.330
There's so much more to you
than you know.

01:56:01.496 --> 01:56:04.466
Not just pain and anger.

01:56:04.624 --> 01:56:06.501
There's good, too. I felt it.

01:56:07.002 --> 01:56:08.879
It's not just me
you're walking away from.

01:56:09.045 --> 01:56:13.221
Here, you have the chance to be a part of
something much bigger than yourself.

01:56:13.383 --> 01:56:16.227
And it needs you, Erik.

01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.168
Useless.

01:56:52.506 --> 01:56:53.849
<i>Charles.</i>

01:56:56.092 --> 01:56:58.220
I know you can hear me.

01:56:59.095 --> 01:57:02.099
We're still connected.

01:57:05.894 --> 01:57:06.895
Charles!

01:57:08.021 --> 01:57:09.443
Show yourself!

01:57:11.066 --> 01:57:12.613
Charles!

01:57:13.401 --> 01:57:15.620
Show yourself!

01:57:45.225 --> 01:57:47.102
Foolish child.

01:57:55.777 --> 01:57:56.777
Peter.

01:58:13.837 --> 01:58:14.838
End him.

01:58:41.531 --> 01:58:42.532
Raven.

01:58:50.832 --> 01:58:52.209
The great hero.

01:58:57.297 --> 01:58:59.516
- I'm going out there.
- I'm going with you.

01:58:59.674 --> 01:59:00.891
No.

01:59:02.093 --> 01:59:03.310
It's me he wants.

01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:04.910
Charles, you can't give yourself up.

01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:07.057
If he has you, he has us all.

01:59:07.223 --> 01:59:08.850
The whole world.

01:59:09.017 --> 01:59:10.769
You are feeble.

01:59:10.935 --> 01:59:11.982
Just like the others.

01:59:13.188 --> 01:59:14.189
Charles!

01:59:14.356 --> 01:59:15.198
Come!

01:59:15.357 --> 01:59:16.984
Rescue your weaklings!

01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:20.203
Give your life for theirs!

01:59:22.238 --> 01:59:23.239
No.

01:59:31.373 --> 01:59:32.420
He was right.

01:59:33.541 --> 01:59:36.044
There is still some part of me
connected to him.

01:59:37.003 --> 01:59:37.799
Charles!

01:59:37.962 --> 01:59:39.555
I can get inside his head.

01:59:39.714 --> 01:59:41.637
Will you do nothing?

01:59:43.051 --> 01:59:44.803
Thank you for letting me in.

02:00:02.946 --> 02:00:04.493
You want what I have?

02:00:04.656 --> 02:00:06.829
You want to feel what I feel?

02:00:18.628 --> 02:00:19.971
Welcome to my world!

02:00:22.632 --> 02:00:23.633
You're in my house now!

02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:36.062
You'll need a bigger house.

02:01:55.475 --> 02:01:57.068
You betray me?

02:01:57.227 --> 02:01:58.228
No.

02:01:59.145 --> 02:02:00.647
I betrayed them.

02:02:28.925 --> 02:02:30.017
Let's jump.

02:02:30.176 --> 02:02:31.176
What?

02:02:36.432 --> 02:02:37.433
Cover me.

02:02:39.894 --> 02:02:41.396
I got you.

02:02:46.568 --> 02:02:47.785
Come on!

02:03:09.048 --> 02:03:11.642
They lack strength, Charles.

02:03:17.807 --> 02:03:19.104
Jean.

02:03:24.772 --> 02:03:26.069
Come here.

02:03:38.453 --> 02:03:39.750
Help...

02:03:42.248 --> 02:03:43.591
me.

02:03:48.463 --> 02:03:49.840
Stay here.

02:03:59.140 --> 02:04:00.767
They can't stop him.

02:04:01.434 --> 02:04:02.606
Jean.

02:04:05.021 --> 02:04:07.240
Help me!

02:04:30.296 --> 02:04:31.422
Hank!

02:04:32.674 --> 02:04:33.674
Hank!

02:04:40.932 --> 02:04:43.902
It's over, Charles.
You're finished.

02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:45.653
You're mine now.

02:04:48.064 --> 02:04:50.738
You will never win.

02:04:51.192 --> 02:04:53.115
And why is that?

02:04:53.277 --> 02:04:55.405
Because you are alone.

02:04:57.281 --> 02:05:00.626
And I am not!

02:05:12.672 --> 02:05:13.844
<i>Let...</i>

02:05:14.298 --> 02:05:15.675
go.

02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:18.098
<i>Unleash your power, Jean.</i>

02:05:19.554 --> 02:05:20.851
No fear.

02:06:08.978 --> 02:06:11.197
Unleash your power!

02:06:11.647 --> 02:06:13.365
Let go, Jean!

02:06:13.816 --> 02:06:15.784
Jean, let go!

02:06:51.604 --> 02:06:53.231
He's getting away.

02:07:10.748 --> 02:07:14.378
All is revealed.

02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:17.941
Charles! Charles!

02:08:19.442 --> 02:08:20.522
- We've lost him!
- Charles.

02:08:20.610 --> 02:08:22.283
- He's gone.
- No, Charles.

02:08:22.445 --> 02:08:23.446
Charles...

02:08:23.946 --> 02:08:25.118
No, he's not.

02:08:26.532 --> 02:08:27.784
I can still feel him.

02:08:51.974 --> 02:08:53.647
Thank you, Jean.

02:08:55.728 --> 02:08:56.729
Charles?

02:08:57.730 --> 02:08:59.357
Charles, do you know where you are?

02:09:02.818 --> 02:09:04.491
I'm on a beach.

02:09:10.576 --> 02:09:12.249
In Cuba.

02:09:13.996 --> 02:09:15.418
With you.

02:09:15.831 --> 02:09:17.333
What beach?

02:09:24.882 --> 02:09:25.882
Charles Xavier.

02:09:52.785 --> 02:09:53.877
I'm sorry.

02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:57.214
I should never have taken those
from you.

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:01.752
Hold on!

02:10:06.757 --> 02:10:08.054
What did I miss?

02:10:10.928 --> 02:10:13.397
<i>It seems only by the grace of God...</i>

02:10:13.556 --> 02:10:14.796
<i>that the ominous destruction...</i>

02:10:14.932 --> 02:10:17.776
<i>seen from one end of the globe
to the other, has stopped.</i>

02:10:17.935 --> 02:10:20.313
<i>At a debriefing today,
CIA Special Agent Moira MacTaggert...</i>

02:10:20.479 --> 02:10:22.652
<i>revealed to an investigative
committee...</i>

02:10:22.815 --> 02:10:25.785
<i>The committee was further stunned
to learn that fugitive Erik Lehnsherr...</i>

02:10:25.943 --> 02:10:28.162
<i>aided in defeating
this powerful and unknown...</i>

02:10:28.321 --> 02:10:30.665
I think our prayers were answered.

02:10:31.407 --> 02:10:32.829
Thank you, Mr. President.

02:10:32.992 --> 02:10:34.636
<i>The potential destructive power
of mutants...</i>

02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:36.754
<i>...is sure to fuel new controversy
and debate...</i>

02:10:36.912 --> 02:10:40.633
<i>at a time when mutants were becoming
accepted around the world.</i>

02:11:07.777 --> 02:11:10.200
Mystique told me he is your father.

02:11:11.322 --> 02:11:13.370
Are you gonna tell him?

02:11:14.617 --> 02:11:15.618
I might...

02:11:16.535 --> 02:11:17.707
one day.

02:11:19.288 --> 02:11:22.212
I think for now, I'm just gonna
stick around here for a while.

02:11:27.963 --> 02:11:29.135
Me, too.

02:11:40.226 --> 02:11:43.230
The world's already begun
rebuilding its arsenals.

02:11:43.854 --> 02:11:46.152
It's human nature, Charles.

02:11:47.858 --> 02:11:49.201
I still have hope.

02:11:50.486 --> 02:11:51.487
Oh, yes.

02:11:52.905 --> 02:11:53.997
"Hope."

02:11:54.824 --> 02:11:56.667
I was right about Raven.

02:11:57.410 --> 02:11:59.083
I was even right about you.

02:12:02.581 --> 02:12:04.083
What about the rest of the world?

02:12:06.001 --> 02:12:08.720
Doesn't it ever wake you up
in the middle of the night?

02:12:10.881 --> 02:12:13.930
The feeling that one day
they'll come for you...

02:12:14.093 --> 02:12:16.187
and your children.

02:12:17.596 --> 02:12:19.348
It does, indeed.

02:12:19.515 --> 02:12:22.359
What do you do when you wake up to that?

02:12:23.561 --> 02:12:26.030
I feel a great swell of pity
for the poor soul...

02:12:26.188 --> 02:12:29.533
that comes to my school
looking for trouble.

02:12:34.530 --> 02:12:36.749
You're sure I can't convince you
to stay?

02:12:38.409 --> 02:12:40.207
You're psychic, Charles.

02:12:40.703 --> 02:12:42.580
You can convince me to do anything.

02:12:45.374 --> 02:12:47.047
Goodbye, old friend.

02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:49.553
Good luck, Professor.

02:12:54.967 --> 02:12:56.447
Forget everything you think you know.

02:12:58.387 --> 02:13:00.765
Whatever lessons you learned
in school...

02:13:02.141 --> 02:13:04.064
whatever your parents taught you.

02:13:05.561 --> 02:13:08.405
None of that matters!

02:13:09.899 --> 02:13:11.742
You're not kids anymore.

02:13:12.318 --> 02:13:13.945
You're not students.

02:13:18.073 --> 02:13:19.495
You're X-Men.
