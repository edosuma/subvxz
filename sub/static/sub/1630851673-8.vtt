00:24.560 --> 00:26.040
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Hi, lady.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.080
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.680
You left this. At my house.

00:28.840 --> 00:30.680
Oh, what a shame you weren't
home. I've gotta go so--

00:30.840 --> 00:32.280
No. But, actually, I was there.

00:32.440 --> 00:34.160
Because I got a text saying that
the parcel's coming.

00:34.320 --> 00:37.560
So, I was there, but you didn't
bother ringing the door bell.

00:37.720 --> 00:40.520
Okay, lady. I rang your doorbell
at 10:37 a.m.

00:40.680 --> 00:44.920
She says there. So...
There.

00:45.080 --> 00:47.400
No. See, that's impossible.
Because I was there.

00:47.560 --> 00:49.280
Waiting, three days in a row.

00:49.440 --> 00:50.720
Well, maybe your
doorbell's broken.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.320
Have you thought of that?

00:52.480 --> 00:54.800
Maybe you just didn't bother
ringing the bell at all.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.760
Lady, that is against protocol,

00:56.920 --> 00:58.960
and I'm a stickler for protocol.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.560
If you want to
leave a complaint,

01:00.720 --> 01:01.760
you can go to the website

01:01.920 --> 01:02.920
and you can make a complaint

01:03.080 --> 01:04.320
or leave me a compliment.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.720
Compliments?
You get many of those?

01:05.880 --> 01:07.600
Yeah, I do. I get lots.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.800
I mean, I can't name them all
because I'm just, it's...

01:09.960 --> 01:11.200
I only started last week.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.960
In that case,
I really like your top.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.120
- Thank you so much.
- Please give me my parcel.

01:15.280 --> 01:18.440
No. You need to go to the depot.
Okay? So...

01:18.600 --> 01:20.040
You know what?
Don't make me come down there.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.520
Okay, I'll give you it.
What's your name again?

01:22.680 --> 01:23.880
- Crowe.
- Karen Crowe?

01:24.040 --> 01:25.360
'Cause...

01:25.520 --> 01:27.320
-'Cause you seem like a Karen.
- Thank you.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.600
You need to get your doorbell
battery checked.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.640
You found a friend, I see.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.400
Yeah. My sister's out of town.

01:50.560 --> 01:54.080
He gets anxious when I leave him
at home by himself.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.480
Have you tried leaving
the TV on?

01:55.640 --> 01:58.040
You'd be surprised who
that works for.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.400
Hello.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.000
Oh, someone likes you.
Here you go.

02:01.160 --> 02:04.920
Of course.
I'm delightful. Here.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.200
Good boy.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.880
Are you familiar with
Ramona Church Jewellery?

02:12.040 --> 02:14.240
I suspect I'm about to be.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.840
Jeweller to the stars.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.920
- Sounds schmancy.
- Super schmancy.

02:18.080 --> 02:21.080
They had a break-in at their
showroom three weeks ago.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.760
One of the owners,
Mariel DeMarco,

02:22.920 --> 02:25.320
was working a little bit later
than usual...

02:26.840 --> 02:29.440
prepping for a big launch.

02:29.600 --> 02:32.520
We think she was there
when the thieves broke in.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.280
Mariel managed to get
to a panic button,

02:34.440 --> 02:35.840
but couldn't stop them.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.320
<i>[Harry]</i> She died from a blow
to the back of the head.

02:41.480 --> 02:43.720
They got away with
a handful of gold necklaces.

02:43.880 --> 02:46.160
There's no sign
of a murder weapon.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.960
There's no prints.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.120
They were done and dusted
in seven minutes.

02:50.280 --> 02:51.680
Not their first rodeo.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.280
And they'd done their homework.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.600
They knew the CCTV was wireless,
they knew how to jam it,

02:56.760 --> 02:59.440
they knew how to avoid
all the hidden cameras out back.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.520
So it looks like an inside job,
sounds like an inside job...

03:02.680 --> 03:04.360
but it's not, because....

03:04.520 --> 03:07.680
The other partners
in the business have alibis.

03:07.840 --> 03:13.640
Niki Balodis
and Ramona Church herself.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.360
Both were at the Young
Jeweller's awards all night.

03:16.520 --> 03:17.760
Alibis check out.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.040
- Annoying.
- Yeah.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.000
The MO matches a series
of burglaries

03:22.160 --> 03:23.720
in Wellington
in the last few years.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.080
We're about to hand the case
over to a team down there.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.720
So, you've come to me because...

03:30.600 --> 03:33.720
'Cause we found this...
on the back step that night.

03:33.880 --> 03:37.440
My apologies. And they say
manners are dead.

03:37.600 --> 03:38.760
Wasn't there before
the break-in.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.840
There's no footage
of it arriving.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.320
So, someone left it there

03:42.480 --> 03:44.080
in the seven minutes
the cameras were down.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.840
You think the killer
left an apology note?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.720
Could be an act of remorse.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.160
How do you know it didn't
just blow in on the wind?

03:51.320 --> 03:53.280
Call it gut instinct.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.400
You've been hanging out
with me too long.

04:00.400 --> 04:03.160
So, you've got this swanky
jewellery heist murder,

04:03.320 --> 04:05.160
but you want my help
because somebody maybe just

04:05.320 --> 04:07.000
possibly left a sorry note.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.960
Would it help if I say, please?

04:10.680 --> 04:12.160
Well, it is the magic word.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.200
Rose gold with diamonds
and ostrich eggshell accents.

04:25.360 --> 04:28.120
I mean, ostrich egg.
This woman is a genius.

04:28.280 --> 04:29.800
Holy banana pants!

04:29.960 --> 04:31.760
Do you know how much
this Ramona Church stuff costs?

04:31.920 --> 04:34.560
- I'm guessing, a lot.
- And then some.

04:34.720 --> 04:38.200
I mean, those four stolen
necklaces were worth...

04:38.360 --> 04:39.960
Look, I am so in the wrong job.

04:40.120 --> 04:41.920
I'll be sure to let Harry know.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.480
Do you reckon they'll let me
try some stuff on?

04:44.640 --> 04:47.560
It is a murder investigation.
Not a shopping trip.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.480
I'm afraid I don't know much
about the CCTV.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.280
Mariel was across all of that.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.280
Oh, she took care of
the business side of things?

05:00.440 --> 05:03.200
Yeah. I design the jewellery,

05:03.360 --> 05:05.240
Niki runs the workroom, but...

05:05.400 --> 05:06.840
Mariel looked after
everything else.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.200
I didn't realise how much

05:08.360 --> 05:10.040
we relied on her
till it was too late.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.640
The police found this on
the back door step that night.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.200
Do you recognise
the handwriting?

05:14.360 --> 05:17.040
No. I've already told the police
that I don't.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.440
This one is really beautiful.

05:19.600 --> 05:23.120
Yeah. I made that the day
after the robbery.

05:23.280 --> 05:28.000
It was just too awful seeing
the empty spaces left behind.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.760
So, you and Mariel were close.

05:30.920 --> 05:34.640
She found me selling earrings
in a local market.

05:34.800 --> 05:38.160
I was just a penniless kid from
the tough side of the tracks.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.560
With a police record.

05:39.720 --> 05:40.880
That was a long time ago.

05:41.040 --> 05:42.480
It was petty stuff.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.280
Yeah, I read it.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.960
And here we are.

05:48.120 --> 05:51.000
And now she is gone
because some criminal

05:51.160 --> 05:54.840
thought that a bit of gold was
more important than her life.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.680
I just... don't know what
I'm gonna do without her.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.360
- Hey, is everything okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.

06:01.520 --> 06:05.080
Yeah, they're just looking into
the break-in.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.360
Right.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.680
Yeah. Um, I don't know much
about the CCTV either.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.520
Mariel took care of
all the grown-up stuff.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.200
She liked to be in control?

06:18.360 --> 06:21.200
No. She was just...
you know, she was good at it.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.040
The night she died,
you and Ramona

06:23.200 --> 06:24.160
were at an event together.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.240
The Young Jewellers' awards.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.320
Ramona was giving the keynote

06:26.480 --> 06:27.760
for the second year in a row.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.760
And you were with her
the entire night?

06:29.920 --> 06:31.760
Yes. I was going to be
staying here

06:31.920 --> 06:34.520
and helping Mariel
prepare for the launch.

06:35.640 --> 06:37.480
But Ramona was just...

06:37.640 --> 06:39.120
so nervous about her speech.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.520
Is that usual for her?

06:40.680 --> 06:42.160
Yeah, it was a big problem
for a while.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.160
But a couple of months ago,
someone suggested that

06:44.320 --> 06:46.880
she tried affirmations,
and it's really helped.

06:47.040 --> 06:47.880
Affirmations?

06:48.040 --> 06:49.240
Yeah, yeah, like a...

06:49.400 --> 06:50.840
Says a mantra to herself,
sort of thing.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.400
So, the police report said that

06:52.560 --> 06:54.320
four gold necklaces were stolen.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.760
They were plain gold?
Not ostrich egg?

06:56.920 --> 06:58.440
It took me years

06:58.600 --> 07:00.880
to convince Ramona
to design something so simple.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.920
And as soon as she does,
boom, look what happened.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.880
And I'd only just made them
that week too.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.960
Oh, you made them?
Not Ramona?

07:09.120 --> 07:11.880
Ah, yeah. Look, she still
designs everything.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.880
I just sort of
oversee the fiddly stuff,

07:14.040 --> 07:15.720
when she's so busy.

07:15.880 --> 07:19.480
We have a joke that
she is the heart

07:19.640 --> 07:21.440
and I'm the hands.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.760
For those playing along at home,

07:28.920 --> 07:32.000
the security cameras
went offline at 7:40 p.m.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.480
Now, Mariel pressed the panic
button at the four minute mark.

07:34.640 --> 07:38.160
And the CCTV resumed
at 7:47 p.m.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.400
Why go to the trouble of
disabling the CCTV

07:40.560 --> 07:43.240
and then only taking
the necklaces that Niki made?

07:43.400 --> 07:44.800
Four thousand carats
worth of gold

07:44.960 --> 07:46.640
ain't bad for a night's work.

07:48.720 --> 07:51.000
- You're not gonna get that?
- Nah. He can wait.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.160
Oh, go girl.
Treat 'em mean.

07:53.320 --> 07:56.560
Now, why leave a note there?
Outside the back door.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.200
Maybe they freaked out
that they killed someone

07:59.360 --> 08:00.440
and they just dropped it.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.120
And why not write,
"I'm sorry?"

08:02.280 --> 08:04.760
I mean, doesn't, "My apologies"
seem weirdly formal?

08:04.920 --> 08:06.640
It's better than hashtag-soz.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.400
That's not
a caramel almond latte.

08:10.560 --> 08:11.880
She's good, isn't she?

08:12.040 --> 08:14.080
We have high hopes for her.
Where's mine?

08:14.240 --> 08:15.480
Patience is a virtue.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.160
So is benevolence and mercy
to a woman

08:17.320 --> 08:19.240
who's not had any caffeine.

08:23.080 --> 08:26.320
Okay. Now, there was a platinum
and diamond necklace

08:26.480 --> 08:28.840
worth far more in the same
cabinet as the stolen ones.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.760
Why did they leave that behind?

08:30.920 --> 08:33.320
Maybe they panicked
when they saw Mariel.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.600
Or they're not good thieves.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.280
- Hey.
- Be strong.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.160
It'll only take a few minutes.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.080
Or maybe...

08:47.240 --> 08:48.880
they weren't thieves at all.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.440
<i>[Reuben]</i> Something I said?

08:55.320 --> 08:56.760
Alexa,
here's your coffee.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.880
The CCTV was off
for seven minutes.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.680
Why did it take four of
those minutes...

09:00.840 --> 09:02.360
for Mariel to hit
the panic button?

09:02.520 --> 09:04.400
She's a woman, at night, alone,

09:04.560 --> 09:06.520
surrounded by
expensive jewellery

09:06.680 --> 09:07.880
and somebody's jemmying
open the door.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.400
Four minutes is
a really long time.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.720
Yeah, but maybe she was hiding.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.040
Or maybe it was someone
she knew?

09:13.200 --> 09:15.080
Someone she spoke to
for four minutes?

09:15.240 --> 09:16.480
I wouldn't be chatting
to someone if they

09:16.640 --> 09:17.720
just broke my door in.

09:17.880 --> 09:19.760
Oh, if that's what happened.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.360
No. I've seen
the crime scene photos.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.040
We know that someone
jemmied the door.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.400
What if that happened
on the way out

09:26.560 --> 09:28.280
instead of on the way inside?

09:29.520 --> 09:31.280
To make it look like a break-in.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.920
Or to disguise the fact
they had a key,

09:33.080 --> 09:34.680
or that Mariel let them in.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.040
So...

09:36.200 --> 09:37.480
I think maybe it's a murder

09:37.640 --> 09:40.360
disguised to look like
a burglary.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.040
By someone Mariel knew.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.040
Or worse.
Someone she trusted.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.080
Was there anything in the CCTV
before Mariel died?

09:50.240 --> 09:52.560
<i>Nada.</i> And I went through the
two weeks before the break-in.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.920
Okay. Send that to me,
would you? I wanna look at it.

09:56.080 --> 09:59.440
You seem a little, uh, too happy
for this all to be bad news.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.680
Mariel made a deal with
factories in India

10:01.840 --> 10:04.000
to mass produce some of
Ramona's designs.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.240
So now I'm not gonna have
to fork out

10:05.400 --> 10:06.600
ridiculous bucks
to wear her stuff.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.240
Oh, that's good.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.760
The waitlist, it's going off
like a frog in a sock.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.280
Oh, is that a vinyl record?

10:15.440 --> 10:17.920
- Where did this come from?
- Nowhere important.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.240
Well, nowhere important's
got some great taste in music.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.920
Whoa. Mariel was about
to be rich.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.440
Like, obscenely.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.680
- Do you think it's connected?
- Maybe.

10:26.840 --> 10:29.520
Look, either way, there's no
obvious suspect in any of this.

10:29.680 --> 10:33.160
Then we're gonna have to find
the not so obvious one.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.120
So nothing in the footage
from two weeks before she died.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.560
Wait.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.120
Wait... This...

11:34.480 --> 11:36.120
<i>[Madison]</i> According to
the courier company,

11:36.280 --> 11:38.200
a parcel addressed to Ramona's
was due for delivery

11:38.360 --> 11:40.560
on the day of the murder,
but it was never signed for.

11:42.120 --> 11:45.400
- Who was the delivery driver?
- Enzo Pavone.

11:45.560 --> 11:49.040
He was fired that afternoon
for being unreliable.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.760
Seems to be a bit of pattern
for him.

11:50.920 --> 11:54.920
Enzo's last tax return listed
17 employers in one year.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.960
All casual, minimum wage gigs.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.120
None lasted longer than a month,
but I can't find

11:59.280 --> 12:02.200
any evidence of HR complaints
or anything murky.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.040
Where's he working now?

12:04.200 --> 12:05.840
No one knows.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
He told the other drivers
he was going overseas.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.040
But there's no record of him
clearing customs.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.880
He hasn't touched his
bank account either.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.240
It's like he dropped
off the planet.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.840
Got an address for me?

12:15.840 --> 12:17.360
Sending it to you now.

12:19.680 --> 12:20.840
Thank you.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.800
Oh, cool. I'll just stay
here then.

12:31.240 --> 12:33.360
Mads, is this the right address?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.560
Enzo's last known address
was number six.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.280
Why? Is something wrong?

12:37.440 --> 12:38.720
For a courier,
his house is worth

12:38.880 --> 12:41.080
a lot of ostrich egg bracelets.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.640
Apologies, door bell's busted.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.720
Oh, that must be awful.
I can't imagine.

12:55.880 --> 12:58.360
- You're Enzo, correct?
- Ah, yes.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.440
My name's Alexa, and I'm looking
into the death

13:00.600 --> 13:02.960
of Mariel DeMarco.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.160
Mariel's dead?

13:05.320 --> 13:07.640
Poor lady. I had no idea.

13:07.800 --> 13:08.960
I only got back today.

13:09.120 --> 13:10.280
Just got back
from where?

13:10.440 --> 13:13.120
Uh, the Middle East. Dubai.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.360
Oh, you're a collector?

13:15.520 --> 13:19.480
My mother. Her family
escaped Imperial Russia.

13:19.640 --> 13:24.000
She spent her life obsessed
with finding rare treasures.

13:24.160 --> 13:27.840
Ah, ba-ba-ba... Except, she was
very particular about them.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.200
So, um, the night
that Mariel died--

13:32.360 --> 13:34.160
Please.

13:34.320 --> 13:39.240
You were assigned to deliver a
package to the jewellery studio.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.760
Yes, um, I realised
I'd forgotten

13:41.920 --> 13:43.880
at the end of my shift.

13:44.040 --> 13:47.240
- So, I went back on my way home.
- And you left a note.

13:47.400 --> 13:50.280
To apologise for taking so long
to deliver it.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.960
The salon was closed.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.520
Did you happen to notice
anything unusual?

13:56.680 --> 14:00.360
Um, there was a black car...

14:00.520 --> 14:02.240
with tinted windows.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.080
Oh, my God, do you think
that was the killer?

14:05.240 --> 14:06.200
What time was that?

14:06.360 --> 14:08.280
Um, quarter to eight.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.040
I know, because I was
rushing home.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.400
My flight to Dubai
was first thing.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.480
I just love the view
from the Burj Khalifa.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.680
There's a reason they call it
the Venice of the Gulf.

14:16.840 --> 14:17.800
Mm.

14:19.640 --> 14:21.560
Exactly.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.040
And yet,
there's no actual evidence...

14:24.200 --> 14:26.240
that you left the country.

14:26.400 --> 14:30.280
Well, this deal is...
is very high level.

14:30.440 --> 14:33.600
You know?
It's pretty hush-hush. You know?

14:33.760 --> 14:37.000
I could tell you more,
but I'd have to kill you.

14:41.240 --> 14:44.960
So, how does the courier work
fit into that?

14:45.120 --> 14:46.280
Research.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.400
You learn a lot about people,

14:48.560 --> 14:51.040
when they take no notice of you.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.960
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.400
Oh. My flight landed
this morning.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.160
Those long hauls
are a nightmare,

14:59.320 --> 15:00.680
even in the pointy end.

15:00.840 --> 15:04.200
Yeah. Yeah.
That jet lag's a killer.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.080
Mads, I want you to do
a deep dive into Enzo.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.120
Oh, hello to you too.

15:10.280 --> 15:11.640
He says he's been doing deals
in the Middle East,

15:11.800 --> 15:13.720
but I don't think he speaks
any Arabic.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.560
Okay. Are you telling me
that you speak Arabic?

15:15.720 --> 15:17.080
Well, I can say,
"Please open the door,"

15:17.240 --> 15:20.040
which is about four words more
than Enzo speaks.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.320
Oh, hang on a sec.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.880
Okay. That'll be great. Thanks.

15:33.240 --> 15:35.680
How can you have been
making deals in the Middle East

15:35.840 --> 15:38.000
when you were buying a burger
in Wyuna Bay?

15:40.680 --> 15:43.720
It's true.
I-- I wasn't out of the country.

15:49.200 --> 15:52.160
It was me. I killed her.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.440
Your mate Enzo loves a chat.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.240
He's not my mate.

15:59.400 --> 16:00.840
That's not how he tells it.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.800
Though he also claims
to be a concert violinist.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.400
So...

16:05.560 --> 16:08.480
The short version,
Enzo swears he broke in,

16:08.640 --> 16:10.640
Mariel recognised him,
they argued,

16:10.800 --> 16:12.320
she fell and hit her head.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.040
Except there wasn't a break-in.
And she didn't fall.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.600
Did he give you a motive?

16:18.760 --> 16:21.880
He claims his mother supplied
the antiques for the jeweller's.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.840
Mariel refused to sell them,
so he decided to steal them.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.200
We searched his house from
top to bottom, found nothing.

16:28.360 --> 16:30.000
No stolen jewellery,
no murder weapon.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.000
Mm, so what you've got is...

16:32.160 --> 16:34.480
a note that places him at
the scene and a confession.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.080
Which is full of details
that don't fit.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.400
Why would he confess
to a murder,

16:39.560 --> 16:41.240
and then throw up flak
about everything else?

16:41.400 --> 16:43.640
Ah, whatever he's up to,
he's loving the attention.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.520
Yeah, I don't suppose
there was any sign

16:46.680 --> 16:48.000
of that black car he mentioned?

16:48.160 --> 16:51.080
No. But we're also still
missing seven minutes

16:51.240 --> 16:53.360
of CCTV footage. So...

16:53.520 --> 16:54.640
Mm.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.080
<i>[Alexa]</i> Did your sister
really call him Fluffy?

16:58.240 --> 16:59.680
Well, my sister's
incredibly smart,

16:59.840 --> 17:03.120
but she also has very bad taste
in dogs' names,

17:03.280 --> 17:04.720
men and reality TV.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.240
Are you sure she didn't
just say that

17:06.400 --> 17:08.960
so you'd have to yell "Fluffy"
at the beach?

17:09.120 --> 17:10.440
It's very possible.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.320
- Here Fluffy. Here Fluffy.
- Good boy.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.000
I like your sister.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.080
Everything you ever wanted
to know about old mate Enzo.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.440
And some stuff you
probably didn't.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.440
He failed his way through
a very expensive education.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.880
Never had the same job
for longer than two months.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.320
I'm guessing there's
no evidence of

17:29.480 --> 17:30.480
business deals
in the Middle East.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.680
Excellent deduction.

17:31.840 --> 17:32.880
His dad worked there a lot

17:33.040 --> 17:34.040
as an airline exec,

17:34.200 --> 17:35.520
but he died pretty young.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.240
Mum passed away three years ago,

17:37.400 --> 17:39.160
and left the house to Enzo.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.600
She was actually a really
big deal in antiques world.

17:41.760 --> 17:43.440
Oh, so, he was telling the truth
about his mother

17:43.600 --> 17:45.360
supplying antiques to the salon.

17:45.520 --> 17:48.560
Most of the money is tied up
in the house and various trusts.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.040
Never been married,
no kids, no pets.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.720
Just a classic failure
to launch.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.960
Could Enzo have the skills
to jam the CCTV?

17:56.120 --> 17:57.600
No.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.560
I need you to find out
whether the cops may have missed

17:59.720 --> 18:01.440
any black cars that night.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.320
And what'll you be doing?

18:05.840 --> 18:07.640
Being Alexa, clearly.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.440
Enzo?

18:15.600 --> 18:18.680
God, he's
always seemed so nice.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.000
Chatty but harmless.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.400
Tough to believe, isn't it?

18:22.560 --> 18:25.240
So, do you think he did
what he said?

18:25.400 --> 18:27.320
We're still trying to
work that out.

18:29.280 --> 18:30.960
I do know he was here
that night.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.320
Did you know that Enzo's mother
helped decorate this place?

18:33.480 --> 18:34.960
Yeah. Vaguely.

18:35.120 --> 18:38.120
I... didn't pay much attention.
Maybe I should've.

18:38.280 --> 18:42.320
Anyway, he says that he saw
a black car here that night.

18:42.480 --> 18:45.040
Do you happen to know anyone
around here who owns one?

18:45.200 --> 18:46.920
Not off the top of my head.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.600
What about Mariel?

18:48.760 --> 18:50.200
Silver Merc.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.960
Niki's is red,
because her personal motto is

18:53.120 --> 18:55.000
beware of beige.

18:55.160 --> 18:58.480
- Wise woman.
- And I don't have a car.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.400
Well, I think you are
really brave

19:00.560 --> 19:02.520
to go ahead with the launch.

19:02.680 --> 19:06.480
I-- I know it feels soon,
but it meant a lot to Mariel

19:06.640 --> 19:08.880
and... she meant a lot to us.

19:09.040 --> 19:12.680
And now it feels like we can
start moving on.

19:12.840 --> 19:15.400
Niki told me
about your pre-speech nerves.

19:15.560 --> 19:16.920
You know? The affirmations.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.600
Ah, yeah. I know it's, um,
a bit unusual,

19:19.760 --> 19:22.560
but... it seems to work.

19:22.720 --> 19:25.480
Still, doesn't seem like
much fun, for you.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.360
Well, we all have parts
of our jobs we don't like.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.960
Yeah. That's why I quit mine.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.560
You're smarter than me.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.360
That is really beautiful work.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.360
It's 1940's, right?

19:38.520 --> 19:40.280
Yeah, right.
That's a nifty party trick.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.200
It's the colour.

19:42.360 --> 19:45.880
Metal shortages during the war
meant less copper, more gold.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.600
Family heirloom or...

19:47.760 --> 19:49.560
Oh, my husband wanted something
with history.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.440
He is a smart man.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.320
Yeah, he was.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.320
Have you ever considered
updating it?

20:00.360 --> 20:01.600
Once or twice.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.480
You shouldn't feel guilty.

20:03.640 --> 20:07.520
Every piece I design
tells a story about our lives.

20:07.680 --> 20:11.040
An engagement, a big birthday,
a wedding.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.160
When the story changes, we can
change the piece to match.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.760
What is he doing here?

20:20.880 --> 20:23.200
Look, I-- I was just
trying to pay my respects.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.160
Oh, I think you've done
enough of that.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.600
I mean, what was the story?

20:26.760 --> 20:28.120
You broke in here to steal back

20:28.280 --> 20:29.760
your mother's antiques?

20:29.920 --> 20:31.240
I didn't think
Mariel'd be here.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.480
Oh, so that's why you hurt her?

20:32.640 --> 20:34.040
I didn't mean to.
She got fright.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.440
She slipped.
Her head hit the counter.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.720
Except that's not what happened,
was it?

20:38.880 --> 20:40.920
- Of course it is.
- Try again.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.320
Because there was no break-in.

20:42.480 --> 20:43.640
She didn't fall.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.160
And somebody hit her.
On purpose.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.160
Mariel DeMarco had
three grandchildren.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.360
She was on the board of
a medical research fund,

20:50.520 --> 20:51.680
and she played tennis every week

20:51.840 --> 20:53.400
with friends she'd known
since school.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.600
And she was planning to skydive
on her next birthday.

20:55.760 --> 20:58.800
Someone denied her all of that.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.440
My first job
was coaching tennis--

21:00.600 --> 21:02.160
Oh, for God's sake, Enzo.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.240
A woman went to work...

21:04.400 --> 21:05.560
and she did not return.

21:05.720 --> 21:06.840
I think her family deserves

21:07.000 --> 21:08.920
to know what really happened.

21:09.080 --> 21:10.360
God.

21:12.040 --> 21:13.360
Enzo!

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Did you play it yet?

21:18.160 --> 21:20.040
Look, there's been a lot
going on.

21:20.200 --> 21:21.280
Do you have any idea
how hard it was

21:21.440 --> 21:22.720
to get that to you from in here?

21:22.880 --> 21:24.400
At least you can do
is say thanks.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.720
I'm more interested in the why
and the how.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.040
What are you after?

21:29.200 --> 21:30.480
I'm doing something nice
for my sister.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.600
- You loved that song.
- And you hated it.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.880
Yeah. Because you played it
non-stop the whole summer.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.480
Can't remember
any of my passwords,

21:36.640 --> 21:38.160
but those lyrics are lodged
in my brain forever.

21:38.320 --> 21:41.320
I saved up for weeks
to buy that single.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.240
And you stole it.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.720
Yeah. I did.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.520
Yeah, and you denied it
for decades.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.240
Now you know...

21:49.400 --> 21:51.000
that you were right all along.

21:51.160 --> 21:52.280
It's my gift to you.

21:52.440 --> 21:54.600
Alright, but you're a thief.

21:54.760 --> 21:57.400
- And a liar. Thank you.
- Oh, come on.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.040
You and I both know you love
sitting up there

21:59.200 --> 22:01.120
on you high horse
and being right.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.840
At least I don't steal
kids' records.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.440
Oh, to be fair,
I was a kid myself.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.440
Living in your shadow,
I might add.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.400
Oh, you don't.
You don't get it, do you?

22:11.560 --> 22:13.680
You have no idea
what it was like.

22:13.840 --> 22:17.680
How hard it was living up to
someone who's so bloody perfect?

22:17.840 --> 22:19.480
Oh, it was always
so easy for you.

22:19.640 --> 22:20.960
That's not true.

22:22.360 --> 22:24.080
That's one thing
you never understood.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.320
It doesn't have to be true...

22:27.480 --> 22:28.720
to feel true.

22:33.120 --> 22:35.080
Well, thank you for the gift.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.960
And the memories.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.240
Always good talking to you.

22:46.480 --> 22:49.280
Listen, I did not save up
for that single.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.200
I got tired of waiting,
so I nicked it

22:52.360 --> 22:53.880
from the shop on the hill.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.520
And I nearly got caught
doing it, 'cause do you know

22:55.680 --> 22:58.040
how hard it is to hide a 45
under your jumper?

22:58.200 --> 23:01.120
Yeah. LP's are harder.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.480
Oh, I guess you can't be good
at everything, eh?

23:03.640 --> 23:05.600
Yeah. Sad but true.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.720
It's good to see you, Lex.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.280
Enjoy the music.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.120
<i>[Madison]</i> It's a kiln.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.240
To make glass beads
in the microwave.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.200
I've got a great idea
for a necklace.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.960
Should I be worried that you're
inspired by a murder case?

23:36.120 --> 23:38.920
Ah. Should I be worried
that you're stress baking?

23:39.080 --> 23:42.600
- This is about Enzo, isn't it?
- I just don't think he did it.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.800
So why is he telling everyone
that he did?

23:44.960 --> 23:46.440
'Cause he's a classic
underachiever

23:46.600 --> 23:48.040
who never gets any attention.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.840
This is his chance
to be noticed.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.360
By confessing to murder?

23:52.520 --> 23:54.360
Man, that is so messed up.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.680
Hey, I found out what was
in that missing parcel.

23:56.840 --> 23:59.040
It went through customs
the day before Mariel died.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.240
A top of the range blowtorch.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.400
The kind used to
make fancy jewellery?

24:03.560 --> 24:05.040
The very same kind.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.760
You know, if it wasn't
for Enzo sticking his schnozz in

24:07.920 --> 24:09.160
and distracting everybody,

24:09.320 --> 24:10.320
Ramona and Niki would be looking

24:10.480 --> 24:11.680
pretty bloody good right now.

24:11.840 --> 24:14.480
Yeah. Apart from their
excellent alibis.

24:14.640 --> 24:16.800
Yeah. Well, apart from that.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.480
Phone data places
Niki and Romana

24:18.640 --> 24:20.200
here that night from 7:00 p.m.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.840
Till they both got calls
about Mariel at about 9:00.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.480
Now, Niki was visible
mingling all night.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.080
Well, where was our famous
jeweller for all of this?

24:27.240 --> 24:28.280
<i>[Madison]</i> Upstairs.

24:28.440 --> 24:29.680
Locked safely in the green room

24:29.840 --> 24:31.560
doing her affirmations.

24:31.720 --> 24:35.400
Ramona came in here at
7:30 p.m. and emerged at 8:00.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.760
The organisers had
a staff member posted outside

24:37.920 --> 24:39.160
to stop her being disturbed

24:39.320 --> 24:40.880
and they heard her
the whole time.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.480
That's a lot of chanting.

24:42.640 --> 24:45.240
As alibis go,
we're talking rock solid.

24:45.400 --> 24:48.040
Speaking of solid, this thing's
been painted shut.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.360
As I told you,
rock solid alibi.

24:50.520 --> 24:53.320
You know that most rocks
are porous, don't you?

24:53.480 --> 24:55.320
Well, not this one.

24:55.480 --> 24:57.840
You know, smug doesn't suit you
as well as you think it does.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.720
Yet it just feels so good.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.560
No way. Gordon Ramsay even?

25:10.720 --> 25:12.000
I'm serious.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.720
Vegan for years.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.440
<i>[Enzo]</i> It's an open secret
when I worked there.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.480
You shouldn't have come
all this way.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.560
Told you she'd be glad
to see me.

25:22.360 --> 25:23.600
I need your help.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.040
I'm a bit busy
investigating a murder.

25:26.200 --> 25:27.560
I'm in danger.

25:34.240 --> 25:37.360
- I'm being followed.
- Know the feeling.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.240
What if the real killer
thinks I know something?

25:39.400 --> 25:42.160
Stop telling everyone you do.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.880
This is what happens
to key witnesses, isn't it?

25:45.040 --> 25:46.880
They end up
with new identities in

25:47.040 --> 25:49.320
some clapped out caravan
up the coast.

25:49.480 --> 25:52.400
Key witnesses usually have
some sort of credible evidence.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.520
I know I'm being followed.

25:54.680 --> 25:55.840
Then you should go home

25:56.000 --> 25:57.360
and stay out of sight
of everyone.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.200
Just to be safe.

26:32.760 --> 26:34.720
Six stitches.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.280
And they're not sure I'll get
full strength back in my arm.

26:37.440 --> 26:39.280
Do you ever think
about selling this place?

26:39.440 --> 26:40.520
<i>[Enzo]</i> You in the market?

26:40.680 --> 26:41.880
Ah, just you know, it doesn't

26:42.040 --> 26:43.480
really feel like you,
that's all.

26:45.280 --> 26:46.960
You don't know me.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.600
I know that family
can leave a long shadow.

26:49.760 --> 26:51.560
You think you understand me?

26:51.720 --> 26:53.520
I understand why you're scared.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.040
Yeah, because someone
tried to kill me.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.440
Well, perhaps
somebody thinks that

26:56.600 --> 26:59.200
you know something
that can solve a murder.

26:59.360 --> 27:02.360
Yeah, well, joke's on them. Hah!

27:02.520 --> 27:05.480
That night, I forgot the parcel.

27:05.640 --> 27:09.280
I went back, I dropped it off,
left the note.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.400
And all the time that...

27:11.560 --> 27:13.320
that poor woman was in there,
dying.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.720
I mean, maybe if I'd paid
attention for once...

27:17.880 --> 27:19.200
seeing something,

27:19.360 --> 27:21.240
tried to help her.

27:21.400 --> 27:22.920
I didn't. I just drove away.

27:23.080 --> 27:24.960
I mean, what kind of man
does that?

27:25.120 --> 27:27.280
I think maybe you're asking
the wrong question.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.320
I'm more interested
in the kind of man

27:29.480 --> 27:31.000
who goes out of his way
to deliver a parcel

27:31.160 --> 27:33.120
even though it's
not his job any more.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.040
You weren't to know
what was happening in there.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.800
You were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.480
Yeah. Story of my life.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.880
Enzo...

27:42.040 --> 27:43.080
listen to me.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.720
You cannot change what happened.

27:45.880 --> 27:49.080
But you can help me now if
you tell me what you really saw.

27:50.760 --> 27:53.160
She wasn't really about to...

27:53.320 --> 27:55.280
go on a skydive, was she,
on her next birthday?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.440
- Mariel? No. Probably not.
- Mm.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.320
Maybe one detail too many.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.040
Duly noted.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.040
What did you see?

28:03.200 --> 28:05.040
Look...

28:05.200 --> 28:07.200
all I saw...

28:07.360 --> 28:09.280
was a black car.

28:09.440 --> 28:11.320
Could've been parked there
for weeks.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.720
But it was there.

28:12.880 --> 28:14.320
There was no evidence
of a black car

28:14.480 --> 28:16.240
being there
the night Mariel died.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.600
I swear

28:17.760 --> 28:20.120
on my mother's grave

28:20.280 --> 28:22.080
there was a black car...

28:22.240 --> 28:25.360
and the same car
ran me down last night.

28:31.560 --> 28:35.120
Should I ask
why we need a new microwave?

28:35.280 --> 28:36.520
Look, it's better if you don't.

28:36.680 --> 28:37.880
How's the necklace going?

28:38.040 --> 28:39.280
Going great, but I went through

28:39.440 --> 28:41.760
all the footage
near Enzo's accident.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.560
We do believe that
that actually happened, right?

28:44.720 --> 28:46.080
Yeah, somebody found him injured

28:46.240 --> 28:47.760
in the street
and called the ambulance.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.400
Who would wanna take him out?

28:49.560 --> 28:51.480
Apart from, you know,
everyone who's actually met him.

28:52.840 --> 28:54.240
I was hoping you could tell me.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.240
The bad news is
I'm getting a big fat zilch

28:56.400 --> 28:59.920
on black cars
in a three-kilometre radius.

29:00.080 --> 29:02.200
And you really thought he was
telling the truth this time?

29:02.360 --> 29:03.920
Somebody else believed
he was enough of a danger

29:04.080 --> 29:05.920
to try to shut him up
permanently.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.560
Well, whoever it is,
they don't drive a black car.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.200
What about other cars?

29:11.360 --> 29:13.360
This is the closest camera
I found.

29:13.520 --> 29:14.800
Security footage from a shop

29:14.960 --> 29:16.920
down the street
from the accident.

29:17.080 --> 29:21.120
No visible plates and it's red.
But the timing works.

29:21.280 --> 29:23.760
Why would he lie
about the colour?

29:23.920 --> 29:26.800
It doesn't have to be true
to feel true.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.480
Enzo's socks.

29:31.640 --> 29:32.760
They never match.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.240
He wears purple and blue and...

29:35.400 --> 29:36.920
and green with orange.

29:37.080 --> 29:38.680
Well, I admire his
fashion confidence.

29:38.840 --> 29:41.200
But people with
protan colour blindness...

29:41.360 --> 29:43.400
they mistake blue for purple.

29:43.560 --> 29:45.880
And they see some reds as black.

29:47.560 --> 29:50.080
What model is our
friend Niki's red car?

29:54.040 --> 29:56.120
♪ At 1:00 am ♪

29:56.280 --> 29:57.760
♪ The brain is like a sieve ♪

29:57.920 --> 30:00.080
♪ At 2:00 am... ♪

30:05.840 --> 30:06.920
Forensics tested everything.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.480
The murder weapon's not here.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.960
Mm.

30:10.120 --> 30:12.440
Do you know
anything about jewellery?

30:12.600 --> 30:14.800
I know to choose
an engagement ring that doesn't

30:14.960 --> 30:16.840
leave a mark when it's
thrown back in your face.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.720
<i>[Ramona]</i> I've been given.
I am courageous.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.720
And calm under pressure.
Happiness is a choice.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.240
You tempted?

30:29.400 --> 30:31.520
Oh, I don't think this would go
with my active lifestyle.

30:31.680 --> 30:33.160
Hm. Pity.

30:33.320 --> 30:35.320
Point is, this thing
is worth a fortune.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.000
It's in the same display case.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.720
Now, even if you were
faking a robbery...

30:39.880 --> 30:42.000
you'd take that with you,
wouldn't ya?

30:42.160 --> 30:43.480
While you two brilliant
investigators

30:43.640 --> 30:44.960
were window shopping,

30:45.120 --> 30:46.680
I found out that
the salmon blinis are great.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.440
You should avoid
the rubbery frittatas.

30:48.600 --> 30:52.200
Also, Ramona's finished
chanting. So we're on.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.880
Good luck.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.440
<i>[Ramona]</i> Ah, um, hi.

31:00.600 --> 31:03.320
Thank you so much for coming.

31:03.480 --> 31:06.680
Tonight, we reclaim
this beautiful space

31:06.840 --> 31:10.200
and pay homage to my mentor

31:10.360 --> 31:12.360
and dearest friend...

31:12.520 --> 31:14.480
Mariel DeMarco.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.360
Gosh, you're right.
Those affirmations really work.

31:16.520 --> 31:18.680
I mean, she doesn't look
nervous at all.

31:18.840 --> 31:21.160
Now's not really the time.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.120
Really? I think this is
a really big moment.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.680
I mean, for Ramona, certainly.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.720
It's a big moment
for both of us.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.400
We've all worked hard for this.

31:29.560 --> 31:31.240
Well, yeah, but she's up there
and you're back here.

31:31.400 --> 31:32.480
That's got to hurt.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.000
The only thing that hurts

31:34.160 --> 31:36.360
is not having Mariel
standing here beside me.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.480
<i>[Ramona]</i> Mariel was like...

31:38.640 --> 31:40.120
Do you know who's really hurt?

31:40.280 --> 31:42.240
Enzo Pavone.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.320
Terrible car accident
last night.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.600
What? Is he okay?

31:47.760 --> 31:50.840
Oh, he'll live to tell the tale.
Yeah.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.840
Thing is, the car that ran him
down looked a lot like yours.

31:55.320 --> 31:56.760
Well, it wasn't me.

31:56.920 --> 31:58.760
No, but you're the only one
with a car like that

31:58.920 --> 32:00.720
who might wanna stop Enzo
talking about

32:00.880 --> 32:03.520
seeing a car like that
the night Mariel died.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.720
Mariel was killed in a break-in.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.960
Or someone wanted to make it
look like that.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.680
<i>[Ramona]</i>...and she had
a unique...

32:09.840 --> 32:11.240
Why would I wanna hurt Mariel?

32:11.400 --> 32:13.000
She gave me my dream job.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.880
Well, that means she could
take it away again too.

32:15.040 --> 32:16.440
I mean, outsourcing
jewellery production,

32:16.600 --> 32:18.040
that had to be worrying.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.800
No. She was training me
to oversee the expansion.

32:20.960 --> 32:22.480
So I wouldn't say
it was worrying.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.520
In fact, I think you'll find
the word is "exciting."

32:24.680 --> 32:26.560
<i>[Ramona]</i>...always believing
in what we could...

32:26.720 --> 32:28.040
And I was here
all night last night,

32:28.200 --> 32:29.040
prepping for the launch.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.040
Check the CCTV.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.040
Oh, I will.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.000
I have always said that

32:33.160 --> 32:34.240
jewellery

32:34.400 --> 32:36.480
tells a story about who we are.

32:36.640 --> 32:38.160
She does always say that.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.880
<i>[Ramona]</i> But sometimes

32:40.040 --> 32:42.280
even the best stories
have to end.

32:42.440 --> 32:46.440
Mariel was the true power
behind this company.

32:46.600 --> 32:50.520
And,
I can't go on without her.

32:50.680 --> 32:56.480
So it's with a very heavy
but... grateful heart

32:56.640 --> 32:59.480
that I am announcing
the closure

32:59.640 --> 33:01.880
of Ramona Church Jewellery,

33:02.040 --> 33:03.240
effective immediately.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.560
Whoa!

33:04.720 --> 33:06.560
Thank you so much
for your support.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.920
That was a really big moment
for both of you.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.200
Excuse me.

33:18.480 --> 33:21.240
Okay,
I was not expecting that.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.120
Neither was Niki.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.200
Morning!

33:36.360 --> 33:38.240
Ah, Alexa's gone to breakfast.

33:45.640 --> 33:47.120
What?

33:47.280 --> 33:49.200
Wha-a-a-t?

33:53.720 --> 33:55.440
Big appetite this morning.
Enjoy!

33:55.600 --> 33:56.880
Thank you.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.240
I can't help thinking that
we're missing something

34:00.400 --> 34:01.840
that's right in front of us.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.920
Oh, I can relate.

34:04.080 --> 34:05.560
Mind you, so did Niki.

34:05.720 --> 34:08.280
I mean, until Ramona's
announcement last night,

34:08.440 --> 34:10.160
she had no idea
what her friend was up to.

34:10.320 --> 34:11.920
Yeah, you can't imagine
what that feel's like.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.480
Here. Have some toast.

34:13.640 --> 34:16.480
It's the best cure
for hangovers. Go on.

34:16.640 --> 34:19.480
I just saw Harry,
at our place.

34:19.640 --> 34:22.360
Yeah, come on. Don't miss
the critical butter window.

34:24.120 --> 34:25.960
Do you believe that
a lie of omission

34:26.120 --> 34:28.400
is as bad as a lie
of commission?

34:28.560 --> 34:30.680
Those are heavy questions
before coffee.

34:30.840 --> 34:32.560
Indulge me.
What do you believe?

34:32.720 --> 34:34.240
I believe in truth.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.800
And good bread.

34:35.960 --> 34:37.680
Not necessarily in that order.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.560
What? Are you trying
to tell me something?

34:42.720 --> 34:45.400
Maybe you have something
you wanna say to me?

34:47.200 --> 34:48.640
What if Ramona...

34:48.800 --> 34:51.280
was using Niki's trust
to her advantage?

34:51.440 --> 34:53.720
- Alright.
- Check this out.

34:53.880 --> 34:56.360
Niki doesn't have a handbag
in any of the photos

34:56.520 --> 34:58.880
leading up to Ramona's speech
on the night of the murder.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.760
I think that she had it
locked away

35:00.920 --> 35:02.840
with Ramona's safe and sound.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.280
And that means...

35:04.440 --> 35:07.000
Niki's keys were in the room
with Ramona.

35:07.160 --> 35:09.280
Points to you, Feliciano.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.920
Why would Ramona
murder the woman

35:11.080 --> 35:13.080
who was going to make her
mind-blowingly rich?

35:13.240 --> 35:15.600
Mm. Ramona spiked the business

35:15.760 --> 35:17.880
within a month of
Mariel's death.

35:19.320 --> 35:20.720
Money's not her motive.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.080
So what is?

35:22.240 --> 35:24.160
Ramona was about to be the face

35:24.320 --> 35:26.720
of a brand in 30 countries,
but she hyperventilates

35:26.880 --> 35:29.440
when she gives a speech
in front of two dozen people.

35:29.600 --> 35:32.040
I mean, affirmations
can only do so much.

35:32.200 --> 35:34.400
Why not just tell Mariel
that she wanted out?

35:34.560 --> 35:36.280
I mean, murder seems
like a pretty extreme way

35:36.440 --> 35:38.080
to avoid an
awkward conversation.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.640
Yeah, for most.

35:39.800 --> 35:41.680
And even if you're right...

35:41.840 --> 35:44.320
Ramona and the keys
were stuck in that room.

35:44.480 --> 35:47.360
I mean, there was no way out
without being seen.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.120
That we know of.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.720
What, are you suggesting
that she levitated

35:50.880 --> 35:52.400
out of a locked room?

35:55.920 --> 35:58.400
I cannot believe that
you're making me do this.

36:00.480 --> 36:02.280
<i>[Madison]</i> I can't believe
I'm actually doing this.

36:02.440 --> 36:04.280
And I can't believe
you're still grumbling.

36:04.440 --> 36:06.600
Just go and see where it leads.

36:06.760 --> 36:08.600
<i>[Madison]</i> Even if Ramona found
her way out like this,

36:08.760 --> 36:12.640
there were still witnesses that
she was in here the whole time.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.240
<i>[Alexa]</i> No one saw her.

36:14.400 --> 36:17.160
They only heard her,
or thought they did.

36:17.320 --> 36:20.320
Are you saying that
she somehow faked it?

36:20.480 --> 36:21.760
<i>[Alexa]</i> It's easy enough to do.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.520
You record the right thing,
press play.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.280
Of course.

36:26.440 --> 36:28.760
<i>[Alexa]</i> Are you hurrying?
I'm timing you.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.760
Good one.

36:37.920 --> 36:40.680
So Ramona's alibi,
not so rock solid.

36:40.840 --> 36:43.440
Yeah. We could've just accessed
the building plans, you know?

36:43.600 --> 36:45.040
This was much easier.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.720
- For who?
- For whom.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.400
Look, Ramona had ample time
to drive Niki's car

36:49.560 --> 36:51.440
down to the jewellery store
and back.

36:51.600 --> 36:53.560
And another hero bites the dust.

36:53.720 --> 36:56.040
But even if you're right,
how do we prove any of this?

36:57.880 --> 36:59.200
I don't know.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.720
No. You are not helping.

37:01.880 --> 37:02.800
How many times
do I have to explain that

37:02.960 --> 37:05.000
I cannot read...

37:05.160 --> 37:07.200
through your butt,
and neither can you.

37:07.360 --> 37:08.880
Here...

37:09.040 --> 37:11.000
Mariel registered
"Ramona Church Jewellery"

37:11.160 --> 37:13.720
as a trademark in 30 countries

37:13.880 --> 37:16.040
the week before she died.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.040
Ooh-la-la.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.520
But these are all registered

37:19.680 --> 37:22.960
under Mariel's own name,
not the company name.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.360
So Mariel's the one
who wanted to go global.

37:25.520 --> 37:27.640
Ramona wants out,
and Mariel changes the deal.

37:27.800 --> 37:31.240
Ramona discovers Mariel
owns it all. Owns her.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.720
And the golden goose
wants out of the cage.

37:37.600 --> 37:40.600
Whoa. Shouldn't you be
wearing safety goggles?

37:40.760 --> 37:42.880
No, it's absolutely fine.

37:43.040 --> 37:44.760
That's how you poisoned
the last one.

37:44.920 --> 37:46.120
You can still use it.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.120
Just not for food.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.480
Look, how was I supposed to know

37:50.640 --> 37:51.480
that melting glass
was so toxic--

37:51.640 --> 37:53.360
Psst.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.240
Hey, I know that look.

37:55.400 --> 37:56.520
You know what happened.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.320
Better still.

37:58.480 --> 37:59.560
I know how I can prove it.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.120
Alexa Crowe.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.880
Enzo, I need your help.

38:09.040 --> 38:10.760
It's about your mother.

38:20.160 --> 38:21.840
Busted.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.880
Couldn't help myself.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.320
All these intricate
little details.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.120
What are you doing here, Alexa?

38:28.280 --> 38:29.800
Well, I've been giving
some thought to your offer

38:29.960 --> 38:32.120
to melt down my wedding ring
to make something new.

38:32.280 --> 38:36.600
Like those necklaces you took
the night Mariel died.

38:36.760 --> 38:38.200
Ah, excuse me?

38:38.360 --> 38:39.840
Well, that's why you stole
the plain ones, right?

38:40.000 --> 38:42.160
'Cause they're easier
to melt down and recast

38:42.320 --> 38:44.280
than one's with ostrich egg
in them.

38:44.440 --> 38:47.480
I would never hurt Mariel.

38:47.640 --> 38:48.680
She saved me.

38:48.840 --> 38:50.760
And then she used you.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.280
Turned you into a brand.

38:52.440 --> 38:55.560
- She gave me everything.
- You hated it.

38:55.720 --> 38:57.720
You were using every technique
you could possibly find

38:57.880 --> 38:58.800
to deal with the stress.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.520
No. We were a team.

39:00.680 --> 39:02.160
Were you? All that work.

39:02.320 --> 39:04.640
And if you walked away,
she owned it all.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.720
So you had to plan things
very carefully.

39:06.880 --> 39:08.600
All those intricate details.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.680
<i>[Ramona on recorder]</i> I am the
architect of my own world.

39:10.840 --> 39:14.040
<i>[Alexa]</i> You made sure
you had the perfect alibi.

39:14.200 --> 39:17.680
Everyone thought
you were inside chanting...

39:17.840 --> 39:21.200
when you were really
driving here in Niki's car.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.600
To kill Mariel.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.920
You disabled the CCTV

39:26.080 --> 39:28.120
and you were hoping
to surprise Mariel.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.640
But she saw you.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.920
You got into a fight.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.000
And Mariel managed to
get to the panic button...

39:37.240 --> 39:39.560
just before you
knocked her down.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.560
But you kept your head

39:46.720 --> 39:48.640
and you made it
look like a robbery.

39:48.800 --> 39:51.160
Took the gold necklaces
and the murder weapon with you.

39:51.320 --> 39:53.280
Oh, and that parcel
out the back door,

39:53.440 --> 39:56.720
just in case anyone
traced whoever left it.

39:56.880 --> 39:59.920
And you made it back in time
to make that speech.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.800
But what to do
with the murder weapon

40:01.960 --> 40:03.880
and the gold necklaces?

40:04.040 --> 40:05.640
Well, you had a plan for that.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.280
Hold that, would you?

40:08.400 --> 40:09.840
It's heavy, isn't it?

40:10.000 --> 40:11.720
Heavy enough to do
some real damage.

40:11.880 --> 40:13.520
It's called uranium glass.

40:13.680 --> 40:15.280
Very common back in the day.

40:15.440 --> 40:17.160
The uranium gives it
that groovy colour,

40:17.320 --> 40:20.120
but it also has some other
handy side effects.

40:23.200 --> 40:24.600
Cool, huh?

40:24.760 --> 40:27.000
I don't know what you think
you're proving.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.680
The police tested
everything in here.

40:30.920 --> 40:34.240
Not quite everything.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.960
What did you tell me?

40:36.120 --> 40:38.240
Every piece tells a story?

40:41.000 --> 40:43.800
<i>[Alexa]</i> Enzo's mother
was meticulous with her records.

40:43.960 --> 40:46.880
She supplied Mariel with
two identical paperweights.

40:47.040 --> 40:49.400
And you used one
to kill Mariel.

40:49.560 --> 40:51.200
And wouldn't you know it,
the stolen gold

40:51.360 --> 40:54.360
is 300 grams lighter
than the new necklace,

40:54.520 --> 40:57.760
which is exactly the weight
of the missing glass.

40:57.920 --> 41:00.640
You turned the murder weapon
into this.

41:00.800 --> 41:04.000
And you hid it in plain sight.

41:04.160 --> 41:05.720
You went to all that trouble

41:05.880 --> 41:08.080
to run down Enzo
to stop him blabbing.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.680
When neither of you realised

41:09.840 --> 41:12.160
he was sitting on
much better proof.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.120
I couldn't do it any more.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.480
She wouldn't let me leave.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.160
I didn't have a choice.

41:23.320 --> 41:25.920
You had a choice.

41:26.080 --> 41:28.880
You chose what you wanted
over Mariel's life.

41:37.920 --> 41:39.520
Should I be worried
that uranium glass

41:39.680 --> 41:41.200
will make my team
glow in the dark?

41:41.360 --> 41:42.840
Well, not if they don't eat it.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.160
Otherwise, there's more
radioactivity in a banana.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.920
For the record,
I think you made it work.

41:51.720 --> 41:53.240
Oh.

41:53.400 --> 41:54.760
This old thing.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.840
Active lifestyle and all.

42:04.040 --> 42:06.120
You don't have to say anything,
you know?

42:06.280 --> 42:08.840

42:09.000 --> 42:10.840
The phone calls
you keep trying to hide,

42:11.000 --> 42:12.560
sentimental music gifts,

42:12.720 --> 42:15.040
big breakfasts,
I'm happy for you.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.720
You're happy that
a convicted scam-artist

42:17.880 --> 42:19.800
will give me no peace?

42:19.960 --> 42:22.640
I'm just trying to figure out
what his game is.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.480
Like, maybe he just
wants attention.

42:24.640 --> 42:28.240
But maybe he's being nice
for the first time in his life?

42:29.760 --> 42:31.200
It's okay, Alexa.

42:31.360 --> 42:33.440
You can keep your secrets.
