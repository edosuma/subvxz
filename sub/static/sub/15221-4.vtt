all out of our jobs.

Hi, Tom.
We were tryin' to register to vote.

14:37.176 --> 14:40.976
- You were bein' uppity with me.
- If questioning your testing methods...

14:41.046 --> 14:45.915
<i>is getting uppity, then maybe we should</i>
<i>have a look at the registration laws,</i>
<i>assuming you can read them.</i>

14:45.985 --> 14:49.716
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Now,just hold your horses.

14:49.788 --> 14:51.722
Now, Tom, there oughta be
somethin' we could do.

14:53.359 --> 14:55.793
I'd love to, Sheriff.

14:55.861 --> 14:58.091
But he has to pass the literacy test.
Ain't that right, Clyde?

14:58.163 --> 15:00.290
Enemy lines, Sam.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.203
The law is the law.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.762
<i>Andjust what does</i>
<i>that law say, Clyde?</i>

15:11.043 --> 15:16.606
It says that, uh, you-
you boys have to go home...

15:16.682 --> 15:19.014
<i>and study a little bit harder,</i>

15:19.084 --> 15:21.746
<i>then you can come back</i>
<i>and-and-and try again.</i>

15:21.820 --> 15:25.950
Good.
But you only got two more chances
till, uh, next election.

15:26.025 --> 15:31.224
Clyde, why don't you, uh-
Why don't you show these
fine gentlemen to their car?

15:31.297 --> 15:34.198
It's a long ways, and I wouldn't
want 'em to get lost.

15:34.266 --> 15:37.702
I'll thank you, no.
We can find it ourselves.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.761
No, wait a second.

15:40.806 --> 15:43.240
No, you let me get you down there
to your car,

15:43.309 --> 15:48.178
'cause it is a long way,
and I'll just lead you down there, guys.

15:48.247 --> 15:51.148
It's right this way. Come on.
Come on. Right down here, huh?

15:51.216 --> 15:53.150
[ Chuckling ]
<i>Here we go.</i>

15:53.218 --> 15:56.449
<i>Right over here.</i>
<i>Let me get the door here for you.</i>

15:56.522 --> 16:00.185
<i>There you are.</i>
<i>Your chariot awaits you.</i>

16:00.259 --> 16:03.490
Look-
I thought you were the one
white man I could count on...

16:03.562 --> 16:05.393
but now you're callin' us
niggers and boys!

16:05.464 --> 16:07.989
I don't understand you!
I'm sorry.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.900
You set us up!
You made us look like fools!
I set you up?

16:10.970 --> 16:14.064
Oh, come on. I can't believe
you're gonna deny it now.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.073
Who else told us
to come down here?

16:16.141 --> 16:18.803
I don't know
if you did or you didn't.

16:18.877 --> 16:21.311
Maybe I did, but-
Maybe?

16:21.380 --> 16:24.440
And maybe you wrote me
all those letters in college...

16:24.516 --> 16:27.713
about all men being equal,
and it's time for a change, huh?

16:27.786 --> 16:29.720
Maybe you forgot about that too!

16:29.788 --> 16:33.554
Listen to me.
Everything I said up there
I did not mean, all right?

16:33.625 --> 16:37.356
What if I called you a rednecked,

16:37.429 --> 16:40.523
white-butted stump,
dumb cracker?

16:42.101 --> 16:47.368
That still stings, doesn't it,
even if I didn't mean it?

17:07.925 --> 17:10.019
I feel like I'm gonna throw up, Al.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.098
Yeah, I can understand it.

17:14.165 --> 17:16.726
I mean,
the guy I'm here to save probably,
and I completely tick him off.

17:16.801 --> 17:19.464
This is not working!
You just gotta hang in there.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.597
No, I don't have to
just hang in there!

17:21.673 --> 17:23.732
I-I-I can- I can do something else.

17:23.809 --> 17:26.039
I can solve this another way.
You can't do somethin' else.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.102
Ziggy doesn't even know
why he was hung.

17:28.180 --> 17:31.081
You're just gonna have to act
like you're in the Klan
and see this thing through.

17:31.150 --> 17:33.277
Ziggy doesn't even know
why he was killed.

17:33.352 --> 17:35.445
Well, there's no data
on that kind of stuff.

17:35.521 --> 17:38.649
Nobody prints it in the newspapers.
Nobody puts it on the county records.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.921
It just happens,
and it gets buried.

17:41.994 --> 17:44.554
But I'll bet it had somethin' to do
with voter registration.

17:44.630 --> 17:47.724
I gotta talk to Nathaniel.
He's not gonna listen to you now.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.200
No, he's not gonna listen to me,
because you told me I had to act...

17:50.269 --> 17:52.294
like I was on the side
of that jerk Tom!

17:52.371 --> 17:54.771
Well, that's because
if you didn't do that,

17:54.840 --> 17:58.105
you wouldn't find out
how or when Nathaniel gets hanged.

17:58.177 --> 18:00.839

18:11.857 --> 18:16.385

I never could stand worms,
even if I was usin' them for bait.

<i>Hey, Clyde,you all right?</i>

18:18.997 --> 18:21.363
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

18:29.475 --> 18:32.035

away from your car.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.341
Well, I appreciate that.

18:44.690 --> 18:49.150
<i>[ Sam Narrating ]</i>
<i>I spent the afternoon finding fault</i>
<i>with every black applicant that came in...</i>

18:49.228 --> 18:52.322

19:09.781 --> 19:14.650
I think the good Lord loves
the off-key ones the most,
'cause he sure helps them to sing the loudest.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.154
Ain't that the truth.
[ Chuckles ]

19:17.222 --> 19:20.555
If I don't hurry up and get this done,
I'm gonna be late
for choir practice myself.

19:20.626 --> 19:24.084
Here, you want some help, Ada?
You like stringin' beans, Mr. Clyde?

19:24.163 --> 19:27.223
No. No, not really, but, uh,

19:27.299 --> 19:30.029
I don't imagine you care for it
much yourself, huh?

19:30.102 --> 19:32.093
Amen to that.

19:36.775 --> 19:39.141
Ada?
Mmm?

19:39.211 --> 19:41.202
I want to talk to you about
what happened this morning.

19:42.314 --> 19:44.680
Didn't nothin' happen this mornin'.
Yes, it did.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.509
I'm talkin' about
what Cody said.

19:50.289 --> 19:52.280
I'm sorry about that.
It was wrong and-

19:53.358 --> 19:56.293
It's not about wrong
or right, Mr. Clyde.

19:56.361 --> 20:01.230
It's just the way things is.
Well, I don't believe that.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.530
I know you don't, Mr. Clyde.
You never did.

20:05.604 --> 20:08.767
But yours is just one voice
speakin' in a hurricane.

20:10.275 --> 20:14.143
Yeah, well,
sometimes one voice is all you need.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.647

That's what my Nathaniel says.

Mmm.

20:22.254 --> 20:24.882
And he's gonna make
a difference... someday.

20:24.957 --> 20:29.985
But right now,
he's gotta be very careful.

20:31.129 --> 20:35.259
You can't make spirits
like Nathaniel's be careful, Mr. Clyde.

20:35.334 --> 20:39.634
The Lord gives them the fire
to want to change things.

20:39.705 --> 20:43.801
Do you know he talked me into
goin' down to register tomorrow?

20:43.875 --> 20:49.575
That is, if I can pass the test.
Ada, I'll help you pass the test.

20:49.648 --> 20:51.843
Okay? But you've
gotta help me stop Nathaniel.

20:53.051 --> 20:56.077

- Yeah, she's nice.

Would you ever hurt her?
No. Why would I want to hurt Ada?

22:58.677 --> 23:01.646
<i>[ Sam ]</i>
<i>Maybe because her skin's</i>
<i>a different color.</i>

<i>It could be religion or</i>-

But then why didn't God
just make everybody the same?

23:12.724 --> 23:17.093
- Then it wouldn't matter.
- <i>Yeah, see, now,</i>
<i>that's exactly the point, Cody.</i>

23:17.162 --> 23:19.460
It doesn't matter
unless we make it matter.

But Grandpa says it matters.
His papa told him,
and his papa before him told him,

23:25.070 --> 23:28.767

23:33.378 --> 23:35.437
"Stop. This is wrong.''

Now, what do you say?
Let's see if you can hit that can.
