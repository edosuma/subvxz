WEBVTT

00:10.889 --> 00:15.690
By the authority granted to me
by the enchanted order of Elder Elves...

00:15.861 --> 00:18.125
...I, Kaldorf the Great...

00:18.297 --> 00:20.288
...do hereby banish you...

00:20.465 --> 00:23.832
...Drizelda the witch,
for practicing dark magic...

00:24.002 --> 00:25.765
...threatening to harm our hamlet...

00:25.938 --> 00:30.966
...and using nasty, thieving animals
against our citizens.

00:31.143 --> 00:33.077
And she made fun of my hat!

00:33.845 --> 00:36.109
Remember? She said it looked silly.

00:36.548 --> 00:40.814
Oh, uh, right, and the thing about the hat.

00:40.986 --> 00:44.786
I mean, ahem, and the thing about the hat.

00:44.957 --> 00:48.859
Oh, Kaldorf, how bitter you've become.

00:49.027 --> 00:54.260
Have you forgotten all the wonderful times
we spent together?

00:54.433 --> 00:59.166
You teaching me how to harness my power?

00:59.338 --> 01:01.533
Ugh, I do remember.

01:01.707 --> 01:04.834
I also remember how you grew mad
with that power.

01:05.010 --> 01:07.706
I can no longer let my poor judgment...

01:07.879 --> 01:11.508
...bring ruin to this town and its people.

01:11.683 --> 01:14.311
I won't let you do this to us.

01:14.953 --> 01:20.357
Not your niece, Drizelda.
You've mistreated Athena for the last time.

01:20.525 --> 01:25.986
The only one being mistreated
around here is me, Kaldork.

01:26.164 --> 01:29.998
Athena, tell this insufferable old crow...

01:30.168 --> 01:33.729
...how well you're being looked after.

01:34.539 --> 01:38.475
I'm sorry, Auntie,
but I'm staying here with Kaldorf.

01:40.879 --> 01:45.509
You silly little girl.
These people aren't your friends.

01:46.718 --> 01:48.049
They're fools.

01:57.829 --> 02:01.788
Anyway, heh, you don't have
the power to banish me.

02:01.967 --> 02:06.233
Try, and I'll use dark magic
to turn you all into wart ogres.

02:10.741 --> 02:13.108
You tell them, Auntie.

02:36.768 --> 02:39.760
You will pay for this!

02:49.581 --> 02:51.845
And now that that's out of the way...

02:52.017 --> 02:54.247
...it's festival time, people.

02:54.419 --> 02:55.750
Festival time!

03:00.225 --> 03:02.785
Yeah! Yeah!

03:09.134 --> 03:11.398
Heh, I'm glad you stayed, Tom.

03:11.570 --> 03:14.164
You shouldn't have kept the girl, Kaldorf.

03:14.339 --> 03:16.899
Who's to say she's not just as evil?

03:17.075 --> 03:19.373
She is a cat person after all.

03:19.544 --> 03:22.342
I love all animals. See?

03:22.514 --> 03:25.074
I saved him from one of Auntie's spells.

03:26.685 --> 03:29.153
She carries vermin with her!

03:29.321 --> 03:31.846
Oh, no, his name is Jerry.

03:32.023 --> 03:38.792
Don't worry, my dear. People's attitudes
will change over time, I hope.

03:38.964 --> 03:40.090
See, Tom? Heh.

03:40.265 --> 03:43.996
Isn't he cute? I think you and Jerry
could be great friends.

04:07.321 --> 04:11.221
Synced and corrected by R3V0LV3R.

05:09.788 --> 05:11.722
Oh, Jerry.

05:11.890 --> 05:16.327
I'm gonna head into town to get food and
hopefully some donations for the shelter, heh.

05:16.494 --> 05:19.793
Everyone seems to be much more pleasant
during festival season.

05:29.274 --> 05:32.471
Aw. Thank you, Jerry.

05:33.545 --> 05:36.810
Now, while I'm gone,
you and Tom are in charge. Got it?

05:49.895 --> 05:52.728
Whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast, buster.

05:52.898 --> 05:54.559
Remember what happened last time?

05:54.733 --> 05:58.464
Energetic warthogs
and construction zones don't mix.

06:00.672 --> 06:02.640
Go on.

06:07.412 --> 06:09.812
So how's the wing coming?

06:11.416 --> 06:12.644
Wish me luck, Max.

07:09.975 --> 07:14.002
Okay, today is a new day.
Just stay positive.

07:14.179 --> 07:16.170
Elves are basically good people.

07:16.348 --> 07:17.406
Hey, Athena.

07:19.584 --> 07:21.313
Hi, guys.

07:21.486 --> 07:24.148
I hear an apple a day
keeps the witches away.

07:29.828 --> 07:33.389
Thank you for your donation
to Athena's Shelter for Unwanted Animals.

07:33.565 --> 07:36.159
You again? How many times
do I have to tell you?

07:36.334 --> 07:38.199
There will be no handouts.

07:39.137 --> 07:42.834
You will not get a bite from me, hmm.

07:43.008 --> 07:45.499
Attention, my good, good friends!

07:45.677 --> 07:48.037
The preparation of this year's
Harvest Festival is underway.

07:49.514 --> 07:52.005
We have tents the size of the town hall...

07:52.183 --> 07:57.086
...the most beautiful fireworks display,
as well as plenty of games and prize...

07:57.255 --> 07:59.519
Oh, stop daydreaming.

07:59.691 --> 08:01.955
We are already way behind schedule.

08:02.127 --> 08:05.563
Uh, yes, dear, of course.

08:06.197 --> 08:07.528
Athena.

08:07.699 --> 08:09.963
Yes, Emily, how can I help?

08:10.769 --> 08:12.794
You can start by going back
to your shack...

08:12.971 --> 08:16.805
...and making that sure none of those
horrible creatures run amok like last year.

08:16.975 --> 08:19.773
That warthog of yours made this place
look like a war zone.

08:19.944 --> 08:21.434
And I'm so sorry about that.

08:23.748 --> 08:26.114
Somebody stop that thing!

08:26.284 --> 08:27.683
- No!
- Excuse me.

08:39.731 --> 08:41.722
Easy, now. You're okay.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.095
- Steady.
- We got it.

08:45.203 --> 08:46.693
Let's take a look.

08:48.106 --> 08:49.573
There.

08:56.247 --> 08:58.374
Three cheers for Athena!

08:58.550 --> 08:59.983
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

09:00.151 --> 09:01.846
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

09:02.353 --> 09:03.581
Hold everything.

09:04.189 --> 09:05.281
Huh?

09:05.457 --> 09:07.857
Remember, this is Athena.

09:08.026 --> 09:10.551
Let's not forget who she's related to.

09:10.728 --> 09:15.131
And if any one of her beasts gets out,
the festival could be totally ruined.

09:15.300 --> 09:18.701
Oh, they won't get out.
I have it all under control.

09:19.537 --> 09:22.506
Maybe we should give her
just one more chance.

09:22.674 --> 09:24.369
I second that.

09:24.542 --> 09:29.707
Hmm. Oh, all right, just this one time.

09:32.217 --> 09:34.014
- For the animals.
- Here you are.

09:34.185 --> 09:36.050
- Thank you.
- So generous.

09:36.221 --> 09:37.245
Here.

09:37.422 --> 09:38.855
- Aah!
- Uh-oh.

09:45.196 --> 09:46.663
Oh, no!

09:50.535 --> 09:52.594
No, no, no.

09:56.407 --> 10:00.070
This isn't happening. Look out!

10:04.782 --> 10:06.113
Please, no.

10:25.136 --> 10:27.604
Get that freak out of here!

10:31.042 --> 10:34.034
- Who's gonna clean up this mess?
- Not gonna be me.

10:44.622 --> 10:46.817
Oh, no.

10:46.991 --> 10:49.152
Why do I bother?

10:49.794 --> 10:52.490
They'll never accept me.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.628
I'm sorry, guys. This isn't fair to you.

10:58.803 --> 11:01.033
Someday I'll make everything better.

11:01.206 --> 11:04.437
Someday I'll find where we belong.

11:05.176 --> 11:08.737
There's a place for everyone.

11:08.913 --> 11:12.781
For creatures big and small

11:12.951 --> 11:16.717
I've made a place for everyone.

11:16.888 --> 11:20.824
As best I could in all.

11:20.992 --> 11:26.225
My life is like one big menagerie.

11:26.397 --> 11:33.235
But will I ever find a place for me?

11:38.743 --> 11:42.839
I help those who can't help themselves.

11:43.014 --> 11:47.144
And make them all feel good.

11:47.318 --> 11:50.845
But where's the cure for always being.

11:51.022 --> 11:52.751
So misunderstood?

11:54.892 --> 12:00.262
Don't get me wrong
You're all fine company.

12:00.431 --> 12:07.269
But still I need to find a place for me.

12:13.211 --> 12:17.113
Sometimes I feel as bad as you.

12:17.282 --> 12:20.479
A self-defeated elf.

12:20.652 --> 12:24.986
But maybe I can find the truth.

12:25.156 --> 12:28.648
Deep within myself.

12:28.826 --> 12:32.557
And maybe everyone will then agree.

12:32.730 --> 12:36.222
That I found a place.

12:36.401 --> 12:40.804
A warm and cozy space.

12:40.972 --> 12:44.533
When I have found my place.

12:44.709 --> 12:46.006
Yes, I will find a place.

12:47.879 --> 12:53.579
That's meant for me.

12:58.256 --> 13:00.087
- Huh?
- Heh.

13:26.284 --> 13:29.651
Hey, I'm getting the feeling
we ain't welcome here.

13:29.821 --> 13:33.348
Yeah. Uh-oh. Yeah, not welcome at all.
Not welcome one bit.

13:34.425 --> 13:38.361
Go on. You should more scared
of disappointing Auntie.

13:38.529 --> 13:40.861
Yeah, disappointing Auntie very bad.
Very bad idea.

13:41.032 --> 13:43.023
Wouldn't want to do that.

13:45.203 --> 13:47.433
Looks sort of scary in there.

13:47.605 --> 13:50.096
Yeah, it's definitely very scary.
Frightening even.

13:50.274 --> 13:51.764
- Go on.
- All right.

13:57.081 --> 14:01.142
Uh, Tin, we ain't the first
ones who been here.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.146
Yeah, not the first.
Definitely not the first, second or third.

14:05.323 --> 14:07.587
Probably number seventeen.
Seventeen, eighteen...

14:24.242 --> 14:28.542
Hey, look, Tin, one size fits all, ha, ha.

14:28.713 --> 14:32.080
Quiet. We're not looking
for just any treasure.

14:32.250 --> 14:35.879
Auntie only wants
the big round pearly thing.

14:36.053 --> 14:38.021
She says it'll be easy to spot because...

14:40.825 --> 14:42.656
it glows.

14:55.907 --> 14:58.967
Oh, you keep it, heh. Go ahead, it's yours.
I don't really need it.

14:59.143 --> 15:01.703
I got it. Let's go.

15:03.581 --> 15:06.311
Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.

15:06.484 --> 15:09.817
- Yeah, don't like it at all. Not one bit.
- Hush.

15:24.235 --> 15:26.829
Run for your life!

15:27.505 --> 15:28.995
Running! Running for my life!

15:34.545 --> 15:37.343
Stay away from dragons.
Stay away from dragons!

16:05.743 --> 16:08.268
Here you go, Jerry.

16:12.617 --> 16:16.519
Oh, heh. Jerry, can you
get Tom to fill this?

17:16.948 --> 17:20.577
Water. Now.

18:30.021 --> 18:34.048
Where is it? Where is my treasure? Heh.

18:34.225 --> 18:38.855
Come now, show your old Auntie Drizelda.

18:43.567 --> 18:45.899
Not those trinkets.

18:46.070 --> 18:48.402
You know the treasure I seek.

18:48.572 --> 18:52.235
I do, and I've got it right here.

18:53.611 --> 18:54.635
No.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.680
I thought it felt kind of light, heh.

18:58.849 --> 19:02.444
Where is my dragon's egg?

19:02.620 --> 19:05.817
- Dragon's egg?
- It, um...

19:05.990 --> 19:10.222
- Uh, must have fallen out.
- Fallen out, on the ground, gone.

19:10.394 --> 19:15.957
- You lost it?
- No, not really, no, heh. Of course not.

19:16.133 --> 19:19.796
Dimwits! That dragon's egg
means everything to me.

19:19.970 --> 19:25.203
What it contains could give me more power
than Kaldorf ever dreamed of.

19:25.376 --> 19:31.406
I'd at last have my revenge on him
and that infernal hamlet.

19:31.582 --> 19:33.982
Um, maybe we can find it.

19:34.151 --> 19:36.244
Oh, you're going to find
it, all right, heh.

19:36.420 --> 19:42.791
And this time, your old Auntie Drizelda
is going to help you.

19:45.262 --> 19:47.321
A pinch of potion this.

19:47.498 --> 19:50.467
A dab of darkness that.

19:50.634 --> 19:54.126
Ah, it's easier to seek and find.

19:54.305 --> 19:58.071
When a cat is half a bat.

20:01.712 --> 20:06.172
Search high, search low
Search far and wide.

20:06.350 --> 20:11.879
Find me that egg
Or I'll have your hide!

20:20.631 --> 20:24.123
Oh, it's an egg. It won't hurt you, Tom.

20:24.301 --> 20:27.896
You do have to keep it warm, though.
Come on.

20:28.773 --> 20:30.001
Ooh!

20:31.542 --> 20:32.975
Hey.

20:35.846 --> 20:39.111
There'll be some cream in it for you.

20:42.653 --> 20:45.451
But you cannot move from the egg.

20:45.623 --> 20:48.956
Hmm, I just have to find out
what kind of egg it is.

21:03.874 --> 21:05.364
Ah-ah-ah.

21:34.672 --> 21:40.167
No, no, no, hmm, no.

21:51.522 --> 21:53.183
Oh, that's it!

21:59.830 --> 22:01.525
It's a dragon's egg.

22:10.307 --> 22:12.537
Tom, you're supposed to be with the egg.

22:29.927 --> 22:33.795
Oh, my, it's hatching.

22:33.964 --> 22:35.056
Mama?

22:37.768 --> 22:40.828
Tom, he thinks you're his mother.

22:45.342 --> 22:49.779
Heh, what a cute little puff.
I'm gonna name you Puffy.

23:02.293 --> 23:04.921
Oh, such a sweet baby.

23:05.095 --> 23:07.461
We're just gonna have to take care of him.

23:07.631 --> 23:10.327
Though this is the first dragon
we've ever had.

23:10.501 --> 23:13.698
I'll talk to Kaldorf tomorrow.
He'll know what to do.

23:17.341 --> 23:19.571
Mama.

23:58.115 --> 23:59.980
Mama, heh.

24:00.150 --> 24:04.143
Heh, good morning, Tom.
How's our Puffy doing?

24:05.389 --> 24:08.017
Now, keep an eye on him.

24:16.867 --> 24:20.735
Morning, Jerry.
Don't forget to make your bed.

24:25.209 --> 24:28.440
Breakfast. Bread.

25:08.485 --> 25:12.216
Like the cream, Tom?
I got it special for you, just like I said.

25:49.293 --> 25:50.317
Mama.

26:50.487 --> 26:52.751
Mama.

26:59.029 --> 27:03.261
Tom, you're supposed to be watching Puffy.

27:08.038 --> 27:09.869
Huh. Where'd he go?

27:41.972 --> 27:44.031
Mama!

27:46.743 --> 27:48.540
Oh, no.

27:51.949 --> 27:54.076
Higher, higher.

27:55.485 --> 27:57.419
A little higher.

27:58.388 --> 27:59.412
Huh?

27:59.590 --> 28:01.455
Higher.

28:06.363 --> 28:08.092
Higher.

28:10.767 --> 28:13.964
A little higher. Oh, perfect.

28:25.482 --> 28:27.643
Gesundheit.

28:51.275 --> 28:56.212
That's it! You've used up
the last of my patience, fleabag.

29:06.156 --> 29:07.521
Oh, that was close.

29:07.691 --> 29:11.024
If the Elf Elders knew I had
a dragon in town...

29:11.194 --> 29:14.630
- You would be banished.
- Huh! Kaldorf.

29:14.798 --> 29:19.462
They think only witches consort
with the likes of ogres and dragons.

29:19.636 --> 29:23.732
- Oh, uh, I was going to tell you.
- Well, now I know.

29:23.907 --> 29:25.568
Well, what should I do?

29:25.742 --> 29:28.643
Send him back to the wild
where he belongs.

29:28.812 --> 29:33.010
- But he's a helpless baby.
- You have no choice, Athena.

29:33.183 --> 29:37.347
Your little friend here would be all
the proof they need to cast you out.

29:37.521 --> 29:41.719
I can no longer protect you from them.
I'm getting too old.

29:41.892 --> 29:44.383
- Promise me you'll do as I say.
- Uh, but...

29:44.561 --> 29:46.222
Promise.

29:48.498 --> 29:52.161
- Well, I mean, uh...
- Athena.

29:52.336 --> 29:54.065
Okay, I promise.

29:54.237 --> 29:57.866
It's for your own good, young lady.

30:00.610 --> 30:03.078
Okay, boys, take Puffy back to our house.

30:07.050 --> 30:10.451
I didn't say when I'd do it.
I will send Puffy away...

30:10.620 --> 30:13.418
...when he's older and
can fend for himself.

30:13.590 --> 30:16.457
Until then,
somebody's gotta take care of him.

30:20.831 --> 30:23.800
I'll find a cage to make sure
he doesn't get away again.

30:23.967 --> 30:25.491
See you back at the house.

31:23.226 --> 31:24.818
Mama.

31:30.934 --> 31:32.595
Ha.

31:47.017 --> 31:48.279
Mama.

31:50.554 --> 31:52.784
Mama! Mama!

31:55.459 --> 31:56.824
Mama!

31:58.662 --> 32:00.061
Mama.

32:08.004 --> 32:09.995
Mama. Heh.

32:19.950 --> 32:22.919
Well, look in here, heh.

32:23.086 --> 32:26.886
If it ain't Tommy boy.
Remember us, Auntie's favorites?

32:27.057 --> 32:29.992
Why, you got what we've been looking for.

32:30.160 --> 32:33.891
- I don't see no egg.
- Yeah, definitely no egg to be seen.

32:34.064 --> 32:37.591
The lizard, you losers.
The egg's been hatched.

32:37.767 --> 32:40.668
We're bringing Auntie back
something even better.

33:03.426 --> 33:05.189
I gotcha.

33:09.633 --> 33:11.260
Talk about halitosis.

33:19.442 --> 33:20.875
There he is.

33:25.181 --> 33:26.614
Get him.

33:31.121 --> 33:33.146
Bramble bushes!

33:38.795 --> 33:39.819
Ah.

33:46.836 --> 33:49.964
- Anyone bring some ointment?
- Yeah, could use some of that.

33:50.140 --> 33:52.904
Definitely could use some ointment.
Aloe vera.

33:59.583 --> 34:02.381
Hey, guys, I'm back with Puffy's cage.

34:02.552 --> 34:06.318
Tom! Jerry!

34:07.857 --> 34:10.587
Why can't anyone follow directions
around here?

34:23.840 --> 34:27.105
Kaldorf, you haven't seen
Tom and Jerry, have you?

34:27.277 --> 34:29.609
Uh, no, Athena I haven't.

34:29.779 --> 34:33.146
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen them for some time now.

34:33.315 --> 34:35.841
Oh, okay. Great.

34:36.018 --> 34:40.478
Athena, I assume you've taken care
of the problem?

34:42.692 --> 34:44.922
Guh, uh...

34:45.094 --> 34:48.223
Yes, of course. So taken care of.

34:59.909 --> 35:01.206
Drizelda.

35:01.378 --> 35:06.145
Ah, Kaldorf, heh, how long has it been?

35:06.316 --> 35:10.309
Oh, right, ever since you banished me.

35:10.487 --> 35:13.081
And I can do it again
if I have to, Drizelda.

35:15.959 --> 35:17.756
No, you won't.

35:17.927 --> 35:22.921
You're too old and I'm too powerful.

35:23.099 --> 35:25.067
Well, I will be.

35:25.535 --> 35:28.368
We're not scared of you and your niece.

35:28.538 --> 35:32.531
- Huh?
- Athena, you're not like these dolts.

35:32.709 --> 35:37.544
You're like me.
Smart, daring, vivacious.

35:38.615 --> 35:42.051
It's not too late to come back to Auntie.

35:43.720 --> 35:47.417
Just tell me, where is the baby dragon?

35:47.590 --> 35:49.922
No one's seen a dragon for ages.

35:50.093 --> 35:54.723
I'm not the only one
looking for it, you know.

35:54.898 --> 35:56.593
Listen.

35:59.836 --> 36:00.860
Mama?

36:03.039 --> 36:06.031
Athena, you don't still have the baby.

36:09.746 --> 36:11.611
Oh, please, Kaldorf. She'll hurt him.

36:11.781 --> 36:15.080
Let's speed this up, shall we?

36:39.509 --> 36:40.806
Kaldorf.

37:00.063 --> 37:01.997
Mama!

37:10.006 --> 37:13.840
- Huh?
- Oh, baby needs a nap.

37:16.012 --> 37:17.445
Ah.

37:17.614 --> 37:18.706
Auntie, no!

37:19.282 --> 37:20.977
Let's go.

37:24.788 --> 37:26.619
Please!

37:28.091 --> 37:31.788
We have to save him.
He's in terrible danger.

37:31.961 --> 37:37.866
Well, better him than us.
We've had enough of your animal antics.

37:38.034 --> 37:40.059
- Emily...
- No, Kaldorf.

37:40.236 --> 37:43.637
Tomorrow I'm shutting her house down
for good.

37:43.807 --> 37:48.244
The cat, the vermin and whatever else
is in that rat trap leaves this hamlet.

37:48.411 --> 37:51.505
And she's welcome to join them.

37:59.589 --> 38:02.524
Well, then I have nothing left to lose.

38:02.692 --> 38:07.322
- Huh! What?
- Athena, where are you going?

38:07.497 --> 38:12.730
It takes a full night's ride to get to Drizelda's
place, but I'll get there in half the time, hyah.

38:28.651 --> 38:30.243
In you go.

38:39.095 --> 38:43.122
Is our little pet collared and comfy?

38:43.299 --> 38:44.891
No?

38:45.068 --> 38:50.700
Well, the sooner you help me,
the sooner this is over.

38:50.874 --> 38:55.538
All I need from you is a little heat.

38:57.480 --> 39:01.280
You see, right here is a stone that I hold.

39:01.451 --> 39:04.318
More valuable than any riches or gold.

39:04.487 --> 39:08.218
With a power inside that can never be beat.

39:08.391 --> 39:10.791
And to set it all free

39:10.960 --> 39:13.758
I just need some heat.

39:14.697 --> 39:17.461
Just give me some heat.

39:18.268 --> 39:21.897
A little heat.

39:26.009 --> 39:29.410
Not just any kind of hot will do.

39:29.579 --> 39:33.071
Not a torch, nor the sun
No, it's all up to you.

39:33.249 --> 39:34.739
So, what do you say?

39:34.918 --> 39:39.480
Help your old Auntie out
You know what I'm talking about

39:39.656 --> 39:42.352
I'm talking 'bout heat.

39:43.126 --> 39:46.061
Just give me some heat.

39:46.729 --> 39:50.392
A little heat.

39:54.704 --> 39:57.935
So fire it up, hot stuff
What do you say?

39:58.107 --> 40:03.511
Shall we take it easy
Or do this the hard way?

40:14.557 --> 40:16.548
Yes, yes.

40:21.097 --> 40:23.895
Fine, we'll do this the hard way.

40:24.067 --> 40:26.763
Bring me the grinder!

40:27.770 --> 40:29.761
Grind him, boys.

40:30.606 --> 40:32.597
Huh?

40:40.116 --> 40:41.344
Ah-ah-ah...

40:54.931 --> 40:57.559
Sorry 'bout that
it's the price you must pay.

40:57.734 --> 41:01.226
When my magic takes hold
And takes your breath away.

41:01.404 --> 41:05.067
So you better get ready
And hold onto your seat.

41:05.241 --> 41:07.766
The time is now for my plan to complete

41:07.944 --> 41:10.913
I just need some heat.

41:11.681 --> 41:15.082
Just give me some heat.

41:15.251 --> 41:18.379
A last bit of heat.

41:19.589 --> 41:23.184
'Cause I am feeling.

41:23.359 --> 41:26.851
The heat.

41:35.738 --> 41:39.265
Say hello to Auntie.

41:41.444 --> 41:43.912
Hello, Auntie.

41:44.080 --> 41:47.516
- Hey.
- And goodbye, Auntie.

41:47.683 --> 41:50.550
Coming through. Jobless.
Definitely jobless. Looking for work.

41:52.488 --> 41:54.456
Hyah, hyah!

42:10.873 --> 42:11.897
Hyah!

42:30.193 --> 42:32.161
I hope that's the wind.

42:59.555 --> 43:00.647
Jump!

43:06.529 --> 43:07.553
Gotcha.

43:34.924 --> 43:36.221
Run!

43:48.070 --> 43:50.504
Uh... Um...

43:50.673 --> 43:53.506
You're looking for your baby, right?

43:53.676 --> 43:56.770
We are too. We're your friends.

44:00.116 --> 44:02.414
We've been taking care of your baby.

44:08.024 --> 44:09.787
Mama.

44:12.929 --> 44:16.729
Kaldorf, I forbid you to
bring back that girl.

44:16.899 --> 44:20.733
Dear, I don't think you
can forbid a wizard.

44:20.903 --> 44:24.031
Well, you'd think he'd have better sense.

44:24.207 --> 44:26.368
Sense seems to be at a premium here.

44:26.542 --> 44:28.703
If everyone had just opened their eyes...

44:28.878 --> 44:31.472
...and seen Athena
as the kind-hearted soul she is...

44:31.647 --> 44:34.582
...maybe this whole calamity
could have been avoided.

44:35.952 --> 44:37.817
Oh, I fear it's just beginning.

44:51.601 --> 44:56.800
Hello again, Kaldorf.
This time I come bearing gifts.

45:02.245 --> 45:04.941
Don't think of it as a statue...

45:05.114 --> 45:08.743
...but as a marker to mark the spot...

45:08.918 --> 45:13.321
...where a hamlet filled with fools
once stood.

45:13.823 --> 45:16.314
Be on your way, Drizelda.

45:16.792 --> 45:19.056
You're going to stop me?

45:20.529 --> 45:23.430
Step aside, you silly old wizard.

45:24.900 --> 45:27.368
You will stay back!

45:29.105 --> 45:34.839
By the authority granted to me
by the enchanted order of Elder Elves...

45:35.011 --> 45:38.879
...I, Kaldorf the Great... Oh!

45:43.552 --> 45:46.214
Wish you hadn't done that.

45:47.690 --> 45:48.714
Or that.

45:50.526 --> 45:52.187
Or that.

45:52.361 --> 45:58.630
You know, I used to think you
were powerful, Kaldorf.

45:58.801 --> 46:03.864
But now I look upon you more as, uh, lunch.

46:05.241 --> 46:07.175
Huh?

46:20.723 --> 46:23.886
- Are you okay?
- Well...

46:26.562 --> 46:31.590
That's right, Mama.
Your baby just went rock-a-bye-bye.

47:00.896 --> 47:02.761
I was waiting for that.

47:04.700 --> 47:06.531
It's the stone, Athena.

47:09.872 --> 47:13.706
You must destroy the jewel
around Drizelda's neck.

47:17.613 --> 47:19.376
Come on!

47:44.974 --> 47:50.913
Now to turn your happy hamlet
into a tasty omelet.

47:52.948 --> 47:55.075
No, you don't, Auntie.

47:55.251 --> 47:56.912
Foolish child.

47:57.086 --> 48:01.989
I hope you don't think I'm going to be
lenient with family members.

48:07.897 --> 48:11.628
You will stay back! I proclaim it.

48:11.801 --> 48:15.931
And just what do you think
you're going to do with that?

48:16.105 --> 48:18.005
Uh... Ugh!

48:26.382 --> 48:27.974
I'll get you!

48:42.731 --> 48:45.564
Oh, no, you don't.

48:46.135 --> 48:48.262
Get off!

50:02.778 --> 50:04.643
Look out!

50:09.985 --> 50:12.044
That stone is mine.

50:24.767 --> 50:26.234
No!

51:15.451 --> 51:17.146
Mama.

51:19.154 --> 51:20.485
Mama.

51:26.629 --> 51:28.995
Mama.

51:33.836 --> 51:34.996
Aw.

51:51.987 --> 51:55.479
Goodbye, Puffy. Goodbye.

51:56.291 --> 51:57.986
Athena.

51:59.361 --> 52:02.159
Uh, yes, Emily?

52:06.735 --> 52:09.932
I've been such a fool.
Can you ever forgive me?

52:10.105 --> 52:12.005
Oh, heh, of course.

52:12.174 --> 52:16.076
Three cheers for Athena,
savior of the hamlet!

52:16.245 --> 52:17.507
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

52:17.680 --> 52:19.671
- Hip, hip! Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

52:33.462 --> 52:36.693
Have I mentioned lately
how much I love these animals?

52:37.566 --> 52:40.091
Hey, what do you know? She loves animals.

52:40.269 --> 52:44.205
Come here, you.
You're so sweet and huggable.

52:47.910 --> 52:48.934
Kaldorf.

52:50.279 --> 52:52.372
I can't believe this is finally happening.

52:52.548 --> 52:57.281
My dear, with a heart like yours,
it was always only just a matter of time.

52:58.220 --> 53:01.553
There's place for everyone.

53:01.724 --> 53:05.751
For creatures big and small

53:05.928 --> 53:09.489
I've made a place for everyone.

53:09.665 --> 53:13.465
As best I could in all.

53:13.635 --> 53:18.663
My life is like one big menagerie.

53:19.374 --> 53:23.401
And now I've finally found a place.

53:23.579 --> 53:27.845
A place where I'm embraced

53:28.016 --> 53:31.281
I finally found a place.

53:31.453 --> 53:37.414
That's meant for me.

56:30.799 --> 56:33.324
Don't even think about it.
