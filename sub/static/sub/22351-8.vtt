WEBVTT

00:01.990 --> 00:03.990
>> Julie: Alliances have
crumbled.

00:03.990 --> 00:05.830
Friendships dashed.

00:05.950 --> 00:07.990
Promises torn apart.

00:07.990 --> 00:10.990
And it's only week two.

00:10.990 --> 00:11.990
Welcome to "Big Brother"!

00:11.990 --> 00:17.990
(Cheers and applause).

00:17.990 --> 00:21.990
>> Announcer: Previously, on
"Big Brother"!

00:21.990 --> 00:24.990
As the sole remaining head of
household, Shelli was gunning

00:24.990 --> 00:26.990
hard for Da'vonne.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.830
>> My plan is in action, and
we're going to be sending

00:29.950 --> 00:30.990
Da'vonne out the door.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.990
>> Announcer: And Mama Da' knew
she was in the line of fire.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.700
>> I got get it together.

00:35.830 --> 00:39.990
I have to win this veto by any
means necessary.

00:39.990 --> 00:42.990
>> Announcer: At the veto
competition, Da'vonne couldn't

00:42.990 --> 00:43.990
save herself.

00:43.990 --> 00:45.120
>> I'm sorry, Da'vonne.

00:45.290 --> 00:46.990
You are out.

00:46.990 --> 00:51.990
>> Announcer: And it was the
dentist who ended up crossing

00:51.990 --> 00:52.990
gold.

00:52.990 --> 00:55.830
>> John, you have won the golden
power of veto.

00:55.950 --> 00:57.990
>> Announcer: After John denied
Shelli and Clay's request to not

00:57.990 --> 01:00.990
use the veto --
>> if you're not comfortable,

01:00.990 --> 01:02.990
Johnny, just say no.

01:02.990 --> 01:05.990
>> No!

01:05.990 --> 01:07.120
Announcer: Shelli needed a
new pawn for the block.

01:07.290 --> 01:09.990
>> I'm going to have to come up
with a replacement nominee,

01:09.990 --> 01:14.990
someone who is going to
ultimately enensure Da'vonne

01:14.990 --> 01:17.410
goes only thism/y week.

01:17.540 --> 01:19.990
>> I'm thinking of putting you
up in place of John.

01:19.990 --> 01:23.990
>> I'm just nodding my head, but
inside I am just freaking out.

01:23.990 --> 01:25.990
>> Announcer: But Austin didn't
want his Ally in danger.

01:25.990 --> 01:29.990
>> I have complete faith this
her word and I know she trusts

01:29.990 --> 01:30.990
me.

01:30.990 --> 01:32.990
And that's really hard to find
in this game.

01:32.990 --> 01:33.990
>> Announcer: He told Shelli a
line to get a different pawn put

01:34.000 --> 01:35.700
up.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.990
>> I'm just worried that somehow
they have seven people down

01:37.990 --> 01:39.990
there that will keep her in
there.

01:39.990 --> 01:42.990
Unless Meg -- there's no way Meg
goes home.

01:42.990 --> 01:43.990
Zero.

01:43.990 --> 01:45.990
>> Shelli just might buy this
lie of mine.

01:45.990 --> 01:47.830
>> Announcer: At the veto
meeting --

01:47.950 --> 01:50.700
>> I have decided to save
myself.

01:50.830 --> 01:52.700
>> Announcer: -- Austin's plan
came together.

01:52.830 --> 01:55.990
>> Meg, if you could please sit
up there next to Da'vonne.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.990
>> Announcer: Tonight, who will
get the seventh phone call and

01:58.000 --> 01:59.990
win the power of the "last
laugh"?

01:59.990 --> 02:02.990
And how will it shake up the
live eviction?

02:02.990 --> 02:06.290
Plus -- a new surprise guest
will help twist up the game.

02:06.410 --> 02:11.990
All this live right now on "big
brother"!

02:11.990 --> 02:13.990
>> I can't do anything.

02:13.990 --> 02:15.990
-- I didn't do anything.

02:30.990 --> 02:35.000
Captioning funded by CBS
(Cheers and applause)

02:52.410 --> 02:52.990
>> Julie: Good evening.

02:52.990 --> 02:53.990
I'm Julie chen.

02:53.990 --> 02:57.830
Welcome to "Big Brother."

02:57.950 --> 03:00.990
This week, the two heads of
households were on completely

03:00.990 --> 03:04.540
different pages, each gunning to
evict a different houseguest.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.540
But in the end, Shelli prevailed
and now her intentions are

03:07.700 --> 03:09.830
clear.

03:09.950 --> 03:12.410
Da'vonne must go.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.990
So will the single mother be the
next houseguest sent packing?

03:15.990 --> 03:17.990
We'll find out soon enough.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.990
But first, women the power of
-- with the power of the "last

03:20.990 --> 03:24.990
laugh" in play, the
result of tonight's vote is

03:24.990 --> 03:32.990
anything but a lock.

03:32.990 --> 03:33.990
>> Cowards.

03:33.990 --> 03:36.990
Everyone in this house, cowards.

03:36.990 --> 03:38.990
Meg obviously is the pawn this
week.

03:38.990 --> 03:45.990
No one in here is going to vote
against her.

03:45.990 --> 03:49.290
>> Da' is full of kindness and
that's really what's getting to

03:49.410 --> 03:51.990
me.

03:51.990 --> 03:55.990
It's sucky.

03:55.990 --> 03:57.700
>> If you would have told me
that I wasn't going to be

03:57.830 --> 04:00.990
nominated this week, I would
have said you're a liar, but I'm

04:00.990 --> 04:03.990
here.

04:03.990 --> 04:08.000
>> In this game, Da'vonne is
my one and only, and I am

04:08.120 --> 04:13.000
praying for a glimmer of hope,
but honestly, I feel like my

04:13.120 --> 04:19.990
soul is crushed.

04:19.990 --> 04:23.990
>> I know that ultimately
Da'vonne would come after me,

04:23.990 --> 04:27.990
o I have to look out for myself
myself.

04:27.990 --> 04:31.990
It breaks my heart that it's my
hands that are sending her out

04:31.990 --> 04:33.000
the door.

04:33.120 --> 04:38.290
I'm having a hard time with it.

04:38.410 --> 04:45.540
(Sobbing)
>> Da', something is in our

04:45.700 --> 04:45.990
power.

04:45.990 --> 04:46.990
>> Something.

04:46.990 --> 04:50.540
I have no identify wa what
the -- idea what the twist is

04:50.700 --> 04:53.990
but the best case scenario is
both of us are safe and off the

04:53.990 --> 04:54.290
block.

04:54.410 --> 04:54.990
>> Oh, gosh.

04:54.990 --> 04:56.990
I can't wait for Thursday
till know.

04:56.990 --> 05:00.540
>> If there's a way for me to
stay in this house --

05:00.700 --> 05:03.540
>> it would combust.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.540
Whether it's game changing.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.990
>> That's one thing that I'm
kind of like okay with all of

05:08.990 --> 05:09.990
this.

05:09.990 --> 05:12.540
>> If this twist can save both
of us, phenomenal.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.120
I'd be ecstatic.

05:14.290 --> 05:16.990
However, if it's only for one
person, bye, Meg.

05:16.990 --> 05:19.120
I didn't come in here with you
as a team player.

05:19.290 --> 05:20.990
My game is me and my daughter.

05:20.990 --> 05:23.290
Period.

05:23.410 --> 05:29.990
>> Come through with something.

05:29.990 --> 05:32.990
Oh,
who's ready for a takeover?

05:40.990 --> 05:43.990
I walk into the house and I
see this big red boxy thing.

05:43.990 --> 05:46.990
I think they used to use it back
in the old days to communicate.

05:46.990 --> 05:49.540
I don't know.

05:49.700 --> 05:49.990
>> Hello, houseguests.

05:49.990 --> 05:52.700
Yes, it's me again.

05:52.830 --> 05:54.990
You're probably wondering why
there's a phone booth in the

05:54.990 --> 05:55.990
house.

05:55.990 --> 05:58.000
Well, it's all part of my "bb
takeover."

05:58.120 --> 06:01.990
I'll be calling that phone booth
with 15 different tips.

06:01.990 --> 06:05.990
But only one of those calls will
tip you off on how you could get

06:05.990 --> 06:08.990
the last laugh on eviction
night.

06:08.990 --> 06:09.990
>> Yeah!

06:09.990 --> 06:10.990
(Applause).

06:10.990 --> 06:12.410
>> All right.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.990
Kathy: The houseguest who
answers the right call will get

06:13.990 --> 06:17.990
the power to prevent three
people from casting a vote to

06:17.990 --> 06:18.990
evict this week.

06:18.990 --> 06:21.000
>> Oh!

06:21.120 --> 06:22.990
Kathy: America already knows
which call is the lucky one.

06:22.990 --> 06:24.950
Good luck.

06:24.990 --> 06:25.990
>> What?

06:26.000 --> 06:28.990
(Applause)
>> That is so cool.

06:28.990 --> 06:30.990
Cool.

06:30.990 --> 06:34.950
My mind starts to race a
thousand Miles an hour.

06:34.990 --> 06:37.700
I know that this is the one
thing that could possibly keep

06:37.830 --> 06:39.000
me in this game.

06:39.120 --> 06:40.990
>> I would love to win this.

06:40.990 --> 06:43.990
I still think that Da'vonne
will go home this week, but we

06:43.990 --> 06:51.990
just don't know in this game of
"Big Brother."

06:51.990 --> 06:52.290
(Ringing).

06:52.410 --> 06:54.990
>> That's so what exciting.

06:54.990 --> 06:54.990
Yellow?

06:54.990 --> 06:55.990
Here's a tip.

06:55.990 --> 06:56.990
Try to be less annoying.

06:56.990 --> 06:57.410
Like way less.

06:57.540 --> 06:58.990
>> What?

06:58.990 --> 06:59.120
Thanks, Kathy.

06:59.290 --> 07:00.410
I already knew that.

07:00.540 --> 07:01.990
What?!

07:02.000 --> 07:03.990
This bitch.

07:03.990 --> 07:04.990
>> First one down.

07:04.990 --> 07:05.990
Kathy: Here's a tip.

07:05.990 --> 07:06.990
Lose ten pounds.

07:06.990 --> 07:08.990
Here's a tip, breath mints.

07:08.990 --> 07:09.990
Lots of them.

07:09.990 --> 07:11.990
>> Oh.

07:11.990 --> 07:12.990
Kathy: Here's a tip.

07:12.990 --> 07:13.990
A little less sun.

07:13.990 --> 07:18.000
You look like a fickous.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.990
>> You got the wrong guy.

07:20.990 --> 07:22.120
Kathy: Here's a tip.

07:22.290 --> 07:24.990
Try not sucking at competitions.

07:24.990 --> 07:25.990
>> Oh, okay.

07:25.990 --> 07:26.990
Was that number six?

07:26.990 --> 07:29.990
That was number five.

07:29.990 --> 07:31.120
Jeff got six?

07:31.290 --> 07:32.990
Seven is a good number.

07:32.990 --> 07:36.990
Clay, king of the house,
makes this grand royal

07:36.990 --> 07:39.990
statement, seven's my lucky
number.

07:39.990 --> 07:41.990
Sorry, that's my number too.

07:41.990 --> 07:42.990
>> Kathy: Here's a tip.

07:42.990 --> 07:46.950
Showers are supposed to be
daily.

07:46.990 --> 07:47.000
P.U.

07:47.000 --> 07:47.990
>> Okay.

07:47.990 --> 07:48.990
Thank you.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.990
>> Lucky number seven?

07:50.990 --> 07:52.990
Yeah that was my number.

07:52.990 --> 07:53.990
What's your sports number?

07:53.990 --> 07:54.990
Seven.

07:54.990 --> 07:59.990
(Ringing)
>> Get 'em, mama da'.

07:59.990 --> 08:01.990
Hello?

08:01.990 --> 08:03.120
Kathy: Here's a tip.

08:03.290 --> 08:06.990
Start thinking about eviction
night, because you've just won

08:06.990 --> 08:09.990
the power of the "last laugh."

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
>> I had to walk out of that
telephone booth like Kathy had

08:22.120 --> 08:26.990
just told me,day, pack your
bags, you are going home

08:26.990 --> 08:27.990
tonight.

08:27.990 --> 08:36.990
But child, things are about to
flip.

08:36.990 --> 08:37.990
I am losing my mind right now.

08:37.990 --> 08:39.990
I can't wait till eviction
night.

08:39.990 --> 08:43.990
These people are going to
crumble!

08:43.990 --> 08:45.990
Thank you, God.

08:45.990 --> 08:47.700
>> Hello?

08:47.830 --> 08:48.290
Kathy: Here's a tip.

08:48.410 --> 08:50.990
Burn your wardrobe.

08:50.990 --> 08:51.990
It's awful.

08:51.990 --> 08:52.990
Here's a tip.

08:52.990 --> 08:53.990
You may want to get more beauty
sleep.

08:53.990 --> 08:55.990
Here's a tip.

08:55.990 --> 09:00.290
Deodorant was invented for a
reason.

09:00.410 --> 09:02.990
Ewment.

09:02.990 --> 09:08.410
W -- ew.

09:08.540 --> 09:08.990
>> Waa-waa.

09:08.990 --> 09:09.290
Someone got it.

09:09.410 --> 09:10.990
Who the hell got it?

09:10.990 --> 09:16.290
'S lying?

09:16.410 --> 09:19.990
Out of all the people that
needed this twist, Da'vonne

09:19.990 --> 09:20.290
wins it.

09:20.410 --> 09:21.990
This is our glimmer of hope.

09:21.990 --> 09:24.990
If Da'vonne can save herself
this week, then I ain't going to

09:24.990 --> 09:29.990
be sitting here all summer like
a sitting duck.

09:29.990 --> 09:31.990
>> I get to pick three people
who can't vote.

09:39.290 --> 09:42.990
>> Winning the "last laugh" has
lit a fire under me that -- like

09:42.990 --> 09:45.990
never before, because I already
know that I have Jason's vote.

09:45.990 --> 09:47.120
All I need is four votes.

09:47.290 --> 09:49.990
Can I do this.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.000
-- I can do this.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.990
>> Would you be afraid to vote
for me because you think you

09:53.990 --> 09:54.990
would stick out?

09:54.990 --> 09:54.990
>> No.

09:54.990 --> 09:55.990
Would you vote for me?

09:55.990 --> 09:57.000
Yeah.

09:57.120 --> 10:03.990
Thank you.

10:03.990 --> 10:04.990
Would you keep me?

10:04.990 --> 10:06.990
For real?

10:06.990 --> 10:08.990
Da'vonne has a lot of work
to do if she wants to stay this

10:08.990 --> 10:12.990
week.

10:12.990 --> 10:15.700
>> Thank you.

10:15.830 --> 10:17.950
If they turn on me, they could
turn on you.

10:17.990 --> 10:19.990
Right now I want to keep you.

10:19.990 --> 10:20.990
>> Cool.

10:20.990 --> 10:23.410
If my vote is not nulled on
eviction night, Da'vonne might

10:23.540 --> 10:26.990
actually get my vote to stay,
because if she goes, that makes

10:26.990 --> 10:29.990
me public enemy number one.

10:29.990 --> 10:32.700
>> It's going to require us to
just trust each other.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.990
>> That's a hell of a deal,
Audrey.

10:34.990 --> 10:38.990
>> This chick is going to be my
ticket to stay in the house,

10:38.990 --> 10:43.990
like my arch Nemesis like uh!

10:43.990 --> 10:45.990
>>>All right.

10:56.990 --> 10:57.990
She wanted seven too.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.990
But she didn't do it because
she wanted seven.

10:59.990 --> 11:01.990
She it because I wanted seven.

11:01.990 --> 11:05.540
>> Seven is a very popular
number, honey.

11:05.700 --> 11:05.990
>> Bb17.

11:05.990 --> 11:07.990
It had to have been seven.

11:07.990 --> 11:08.000
>> She's on the block.

11:08.000 --> 11:08.990
Let her have the number.

11:08.990 --> 11:12.830
>> No, I know.

11:12.950 --> 11:14.990
But da' whole attitude is just
different.

11:14.990 --> 11:18.990
She's like bouncing around like
not moping around.

11:18.990 --> 11:24.410
You can tell she won.

11:24.540 --> 11:26.700
>> Well, then you're not going
to be voting because she would

11:26.830 --> 11:28.290
use your vote not to count.

11:28.410 --> 11:30.700
>> Of course.

11:30.830 --> 11:32.990
Going into this week, I was
feeling really confident that

11:32.990 --> 11:36.540
da' would be going home, but if
the wrong person gets the "last

11:36.700 --> 11:38.120
laugh," da' might stay.

11:38.290 --> 11:41.990
She's only going to need five
votes.

11:41.990 --> 11:45.990
>> She could get some people on
board.

11:45.990 --> 11:48.990
She would get Jason's vote.

11:48.990 --> 11:51.990
Vanessa.

11:51.990 --> 11:53.410
>> Vanessa would never do it,
though, right?

11:53.540 --> 11:54.000
>> I don't know.

11:54.120 --> 11:54.990
John.

11:54.990 --> 11:56.990
She could talk to John.

11:56.990 --> 11:59.000
James.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.120
Austin.

12:01.290 --> 12:02.990
Steve.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.990
That's five votes that she could
potentially get.

12:05.990 --> 12:10.990
She only needs to convince four
people to vote for her.

12:10.990 --> 12:13.990
Pretty scary.

12:15.990 --> 12:17.410
>> Julie: Coming up, Da'vonne
has the power of the "last

12:17.540 --> 12:18.990
laugh."

12:18.990 --> 12:21.990
So whose votes will she block?

12:21.990 --> 12:24.540
Then it's the live vote and
eviction.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.990
Da'vonne or Meg, another
houseguest is shown the front

12:26.990 --> 12:28.950
door.

12:28.990 --> 12:32.950
Plus -- the house guests get a
surprise from new england

12:32.990 --> 12:35.000
patriots tight end and reigning
super bowl champion rob

12:35.120 --> 12:40.990
gronkowski.

12:40.990 --> 12:41.990
That's right. Gronk is throwing
the next "bb takeover" into the

12:42.000 --> 12:42.990
game.

12:42.990 --> 12:43.990
Stay with us.

12:43.990 --> 12:46.990
(Cheers and applause)

13:15.990 --> 13:17.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big

13:18.990 --> 13:19.990
brother."

13:19.990 --> 13:23.120
Liz and Julia have been
successfully swapping in and out

13:23.290 --> 13:24.990
of the game for more than two
weeks.

13:25.990 --> 13:28.990
But how long can they keep their
secret under wraps?

13:33.990 --> 13:34.990
>> Outside's been open for two
days.

13:34.990 --> 13:36.120
>> I want to tan or something.

13:36.290 --> 13:38.990
You look really pail compared
to me.

13:38.990 --> 13:40.990
-- Paille compared to me.

13:46.990 --> 13:49.000
>> Uh-hmm.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.990
It's ridiculously obvious.

13:51.990 --> 13:52.990
What?

13:52.990 --> 13:55.290
There's a pair of twins in
the house.

13:55.410 --> 13:56.540
>> Say it again.

13:56.700 --> 13:59.990
Liz is a damn twin.

13:59.990 --> 14:03.990
I noticed it before, but then I
was like, no, you trippin'.

14:03.990 --> 14:06.990
But today,child.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.990
>> For the past couple of weeks,
I've been noticing that Liz's

14:11.990 --> 14:15.410
body isn't exactly the same
every time I see her.

14:15.540 --> 14:18.290
9:00 this morning, you had a
little bit more weight than

14:18.410 --> 14:19.990
that, boo.

14:19.990 --> 14:20.990
Slimfast don't work that fast.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.830
>> She definitely looks thinner.

14:23.950 --> 14:28.120
The one last night is the
friendly one.

14:28.290 --> 14:28.990
This is it.

14:28.990 --> 14:30.990
>> No.

14:30.990 --> 14:32.990
They got a lot of the hats
that cover their faces.

14:32.990 --> 14:36.990
They got a lot of eyeglasses
that cover their faces.

14:36.990 --> 14:37.990
>> Am I burnt?

14:37.990 --> 14:38.990
No.

14:38.990 --> 14:39.990
I put a lot of sunscreen on.

14:39.990 --> 14:42.990
I don't want to get too toasty.

14:42.990 --> 14:44.990
>> Can I see your glasses, Liz?

14:44.990 --> 14:45.990
Uh-hmm.

14:45.990 --> 14:47.990
They're like mirrored.

14:47.990 --> 14:50.830
>> Uh-hmm.

14:50.950 --> 14:53.990
As a bb historian, I know
that "Big Brother" has had twins

14:53.990 --> 14:57.950
play as one player before.

14:57.990 --> 15:04.990
In & my gut is telling me that
that is happening this season.

15:04.990 --> 15:05.540
>> Something.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.540
Liz is a [ Bleep ] twin.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.990
Last night she was heavy twin.

15:09.990 --> 15:13.990
Today she's skinny twin.

15:13.990 --> 15:15.990
Yesterday this bitch was 20
pounds heavier.

15:15.990 --> 15:17.290
That one wears the bunny hat.

15:17.410 --> 15:20.990
The skinny one wears the bikini.

15:20.990 --> 15:23.990
The skinny one lays around --
>> which one should I go for?

15:23.990 --> 15:29.990
(Laughter)
>> I am 100% positive.

15:29.990 --> 15:32.990
Are you just being conspiracy
theorists.

15:32.990 --> 15:34.990
>> We might be crazy but --
no, no.

15:34.990 --> 15:35.990
T crazy.

15:35.990 --> 15:39.990
There are two of those girls.

15:40.000 --> 15:46.290
Go look at her face.

15:46.410 --> 15:46.990
>> What?

15:46.990 --> 15:46.990
What?

15:46.990 --> 15:49.990
Come here.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.990
>> Come on.

15:51.990 --> 15:52.990
Look, look!

15:52.990 --> 15:53.990
Oh, my God.

15:53.990 --> 15:56.990
What are they freaking out
about?

15:56.990 --> 15:58.990
>> Look, everybody's coming in.

15:58.990 --> 15:59.990
Should we go down there?

15:59.990 --> 16:09.990
>> Yes.

16:09.990 --> 16:16.410
Liz has an identical twin,
100%.

16:16.540 --> 16:17.990
>> It's crazy, man.

16:17.990 --> 16:23.290
Every single time we do our
efingernails, she picks the same

16:23.410 --> 16:23.990
color.

16:23.990 --> 16:25.990
>> It makes sense.

16:25.990 --> 16:26.990
She's constantly alive.

16:26.990 --> 16:28.990
Because she's just trying to
survive until her sister comes

16:28.990 --> 16:29.990
in.

16:29.990 --> 16:37.410
(Laughter)
>> Only thing I'm trying to

16:37.540 --> 16:46.990
figure out now is how am I going
to use this to my advantage.

16:46.990 --> 16:50.990
>> I can't go into details but
I'm going to tell you I need to

16:50.990 --> 16:52.990
trust you, between me and you.

16:52.990 --> 16:53.990
>> Yes.

16:53.990 --> 16:56.000
Ou have to remain calm,
okay?

16:56.120 --> 17:00.410
People are saying that you are a
twin.

17:00.540 --> 17:04.990
>> My God.

17:04.990 --> 17:08.990
Periodically you guys are
switching out.

17:08.990 --> 17:11.990
>> I can't believe da' is coming
to me with this.

17:11.990 --> 17:15.990
I didn't expect anyone to be on
to us this early in the game.

17:15.990 --> 17:19.990
>> At this point, I feel like
you need me and I need you.

17:19.990 --> 17:20.410
>> Yeah.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.990
I need your vote.

17:21.990 --> 17:23.290
We need to work together.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.990
Because people are coming after
you and now they're going to

17:25.990 --> 17:29.120
come after me.

17:29.290 --> 17:30.700
>> I see it on her face.

17:30.830 --> 17:33.990
She's trying to keep her
composure, because of course,

17:33.990 --> 17:35.540
she can't let me know that it's
true.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.700
I feel like this conversation is
going exactly the way I want it

17:37.830 --> 17:38.000
to.

17:38.120 --> 17:40.950
I think it's going to work in my
favor.

17:40.990 --> 17:42.990
>> I need you to keep me in
here.

17:42.990 --> 17:43.990
>> I want you here for sure.

17:43.990 --> 17:49.410
Thank you, baby.

17:49.540 --> 17:51.990
Julie: Coming up --
Da'vonne is on to the twin

17:51.990 --> 17:57.990
twist and has the power of the
"last laugh."

17:57.990 --> 17:58.990
Is it enough to keep her in the
game?

17:58.990 --> 17:59.990
The live vote and eviction is
next.

17:59.990 --> 18:01.950
Stay with us.

18:01.990 --> 18:05.990
(Cheers and applause)

18:19.290 --> 18:20.540
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big

18:20.700 --> 18:21.540
brother."

18:21.700 --> 18:24.990
Earlier today, Da'vonne
secretly chose the three

18:24.990 --> 18:26.990
houseguests she is blocking from
voting tonight.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.990
It's now time to reveal her
decision to you and the

18:29.990 --> 18:31.990
houseguests.

18:31.990 --> 18:33.990
Hello, houseguests.

18:33.990 --> 18:36.120
>> Hey, July!

18:36.290 --> 18:38.990
Julie: Well, as you all know,
there was a very big power up

18:38.990 --> 18:42.990
for grabs this week, the power
of the "last laugh."

18:42.990 --> 18:45.990
As it was explained to you, the
houseguest who won this power

18:45.990 --> 18:50.990
would be able to keep three
people from voting tonight.

18:50.990 --> 18:54.990
And while I cannot reveal the
name of the houseguest who won

18:54.990 --> 18:58.990
this power, I will reveal the
names of the houseguests who

18:58.990 --> 18:59.990
will not be voting.

18:59.990 --> 19:04.990
Once I reveal all three names, I
need those three people to head

19:04.990 --> 19:05.990
to the dining room.

19:05.990 --> 19:08.990
You will not be present for the
live vote.

19:08.990 --> 19:10.990
Here we go.

19:10.990 --> 19:14.990
The three houseguests sitting
out of tonight's vote are --

19:14.990 --> 19:16.700
Becky.

19:16.830 --> 19:17.990
Jeff.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.990
And Jackie.

19:20.990 --> 19:22.990
The three of you, please take a
seat in the dining room.

19:38.990 --> 19:40.990
All right.

19:40.990 --> 19:42.990
Now,
for the rest of you, it's now

19:42.990 --> 19:43.990
time for the live vote to begin.

19:43.990 --> 19:46.990
Da'vonne, Meg, in just
moments, your housemates will

19:46.990 --> 19:48.990
cast their votes to evict live.

19:48.990 --> 19:52.990
But before they do, you each
have a final chance to sway

19:52.990 --> 19:56.990
their votes with one brief
statement.

19:56.990 --> 19:57.990
Da'vonne, you're first.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.410
>> All right.

19:59.540 --> 20:00.990
First, give it out to God.

20:00.990 --> 20:01.990
Cade owns, I love you.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.990
Meg, I have nothing negative to
say about you.

20:03.990 --> 20:05.990
I think you're a jewel.

20:05.990 --> 20:09.410
In this house there are strong
people and there are also a pack

20:09.540 --> 20:10.410
of cowards.

20:10.540 --> 20:11.990
I have proven myself to be a
very strong person.

20:11.990 --> 20:14.990
The people that are cowards are
currently controlling the house

20:14.990 --> 20:17.990
which is why they put me up
against a beautiful girl who is

20:17.990 --> 20:19.410
my -- one of my good friend.

20:19.540 --> 20:20.990
It's Jason, I love you.

20:20.990 --> 20:22.830
Never have negative thing to say
about you.

20:22.950 --> 20:25.990
When you go to make your vote,
please vote for me because I am

20:25.990 --> 20:28.990
strong and I will protect you in
this game because I'm not afraid

20:28.990 --> 20:32.410
of anybody in here or you can
vote for Meg and let her be the

20:32.540 --> 20:33.990
beautiful pawn sitting next to
you next week.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.120
Thank you.

20:37.290 --> 20:38.990
>> Julie: Thank you, Da'vonne.

20:38.990 --> 20:39.990
Meg, it's your turn.

20:39.990 --> 20:43.990
>> First off, I'm so thankful to
be here.

20:43.990 --> 20:46.990
Da'vonne, you are one of the
strongest women I've ever met.

20:46.990 --> 20:47.990
This week has been very hard.

20:47.990 --> 20:50.990
You know that.

20:50.990 --> 20:53.990
Houseguests, I feel like I have
so much more game to play in

20:53.990 --> 20:54.990
this.

20:54.990 --> 20:55.990
I've been playing a loyal game
so far.

20:55.990 --> 20:57.950
Please keep me in it.

20:57.990 --> 21:01.290
I promise to work on my
knock-knock jokes and you all

21:01.410 --> 21:05.990
are looking so hot tonight!

21:05.990 --> 21:05.990
>> Julie: Thank you, Meg.

21:05.990 --> 21:06.990
Thank you, both.

21:06.990 --> 21:07.950
All right, everyone.

21:07.990 --> 21:09.990
It's time for the live voting to
begin.

21:09.990 --> 21:12.990
Shelli, as head of household,
you are not allowed to vote.

21:12.990 --> 21:15.410
Neither are the two nominees.

21:15.540 --> 21:18.990
All other eligible houseguests
will enter the diary room and

21:18.990 --> 21:21.990
cast their vote to evict.

21:21.990 --> 21:22.990
Jason, you're up first.

21:22.990 --> 21:29.000
Please go to the diary room.

21:29.120 --> 21:32.990
Jason and Da'vonne are best
friends in the house.

21:32.990 --> 21:36.990
And his loyalty toward her has
never wavered.

21:37.000 --> 21:37.990
Hi, Jason.

21:37.990 --> 21:38.990
>> Hey, Julie.

21:38.990 --> 21:41.120
Julie: Please cast your vote
to evict.

21:41.290 --> 21:43.990
>> I bravely vote to evict Meg.

21:43.990 --> 21:44.990
Julie: Thank you.

21:44.990 --> 21:47.990
Thank you.

21:47.990 --> 21:50.120
Julie: Clay has been
targeting

21:50.290 --> 21:51.120
Da'vonne since their blowup.

21:51.290 --> 21:54.990
He should follow through with
his vote tonight.

21:54.990 --> 21:55.990
Hi, Clay.

21:55.990 --> 21:56.990
>> Hey, Julie.

21:56.990 --> 21:58.990
Julie: Please cast your vote
to evict.

21:58.990 --> 22:02.990
>> I vote to evict mama da'.

22:02.990 --> 22:03.990
Julie: Thank you.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.990
Love you, miss you.

22:06.990 --> 22:07.990
Julie: John threw the battle
of the block to keep Da'vonne

22:07.990 --> 22:10.990
on the block.

22:10.990 --> 22:14.990
But now that he's safe, what's
best for his game?

22:14.990 --> 22:15.990
Hi, John.

22:15.990 --> 22:16.990
>> Hello.

22:16.990 --> 22:19.990
Julie: Please cast your vote
to evict.

22:19.990 --> 22:23.990
>> He votes to evict da'.

22:23.990 --> 22:24.700
Julie: Da'vonne.

22:24.830 --> 22:24.990
Da'vonne.

22:24.990 --> 22:26.990
Julie: Thank you.

22:26.990 --> 22:29.990
(Laughter)
>> Julie: Audrey and Da'vonne

22:29.990 --> 22:31.990
have been at odds.

22:31.990 --> 22:35.990
But is their latest truce real?

22:35.990 --> 22:36.990
Hi, Audrey.

22:36.990 --> 22:38.540
>> Hi, Julie.

22:38.700 --> 22:40.990
Julie: Please cast your vote
to evict.

22:40.990 --> 22:43.990
>> I vote to evict Meg.

22:43.990 --> 22:43.990
Julie: Thank you.

22:43.990 --> 22:47.950
Thanks.

22:47.990 --> 22:49.990
Julie: With two votes to
evict Da'vonne and two votes

22:49.990 --> 22:55.990
to evict Meg, it is currently a
tie.

22:55.990 --> 22:56.990
The final five votes will be
cast live when we return.

22:56.990 --> 22:58.410
Stay with us.

22:58.540 --> 23:01.950
(Cheers and applause)

23:32.990 --> 23:33.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big

23:33.990 --> 23:34.990
brother"!

23:34.990 --> 23:36.990
The houseguests are voting live
to evict either Da'vonne or

23:36.990 --> 23:38.990
Meg.

23:38.990 --> 23:41.990
With two votes each, it's
currently a tie.

23:41.990 --> 23:47.540
Let's continue with the live
vote.

23:47.700 --> 23:49.540
>> Julie: Austin helped get Meg
up on the block.

23:49.700 --> 23:50.990
Will he now help to get her out
of the house?

23:50.990 --> 23:52.990
Hi, Austin.

23:52.990 --> 23:53.990
>> Hi, Julie.

23:53.990 --> 23:55.990
Julie: Please cast your vote
to evict.

23:55.990 --> 23:59.700
>> Austin and Judas have no idea
what's going on in this house.

23:59.830 --> 24:02.990
But nevertheless I'm voting to
evict Da'vonne.

24:02.990 --> 24:05.290
>> Julie: Thank you.

24:05.410 --> 24:09.990
Da'vonne suspects Liz is part
of a twin twist and tried to use

24:09.990 --> 24:11.290
it to her advantage.

24:11.410 --> 24:17.410
Did it work?

24:17.540 --> 24:18.990
Hello, Liz.

24:18.990 --> 24:19.990
>> Hi, Julie.

24:19.990 --> 24:24.990
Julie: Or should I say hello,
Julia?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.990
>> Yes, that's correct.

24:26.990 --> 24:27.990
Julie: Julia, please cast
your vote to evict.

24:27.990 --> 24:29.990
>> I vote to evict Da'vonne.

24:29.990 --> 24:31.990
Julie: Thank you.

24:31.990 --> 24:34.990
Vanessa told
Da'vonne she would keep her.

24:34.990 --> 24:40.990
Will she stick to that plan?

24:40.990 --> 24:42.990
Hi, Vanessa.

24:42.990 --> 24:43.990
>> Hey, Julie.

24:43.990 --> 24:45.990
Julie: Please cast your vote
to evict now.

24:45.990 --> 24:49.990
>> Sadly, I vote to evict the
very beautiful da'.

24:49.990 --> 24:49.990
>> Julie: Da'vonne.

24:49.990 --> 24:55.990
Thank you, Vanessa.

24:55.990 --> 24:58.540
It's official, with five votes
to evict Da'vonne, Da'vonne

24:58.700 --> 25:01.990
will leave the house tonight but
let's see how the other two

25:01.990 --> 25:06.700
votes fall.

25:06.830 --> 25:08.990
Hi, James.

25:08.990 --> 25:11.410
>> Hi, Julie.

25:11.540 --> 25:12.990
Julie: Please cast your vote
to evict.

25:12.990 --> 25:17.120
>> I sadly vote to evict my girl
da'.

25:17.290 --> 25:19.990
>> Julie: Thank you, James.

25:19.990 --> 25:20.990
Steve has been on his own from
day one.

25:20.990 --> 25:22.700
So what is best for his game?

25:22.830 --> 25:23.990
Hi, Steve.

25:23.990 --> 25:24.990
>> Hi, Julie.

25:24.990 --> 25:26.990
Julie: Please cast your vote
to evict now.

25:26.990 --> 25:29.990
>> I vote to evict the loving
Da'vonne.

25:29.990 --> 25:30.700
>> Julie: Thank you.

25:30.830 --> 25:39.990
Thank you, Julie.

25:39.990 --> 25:41.990
Julie: All of the votes are
in.

25:41.990 --> 25:45.990
Let's give the news to the
houseguests.

25:45.990 --> 25:47.990
Houseguests, the votes are in.

25:47.990 --> 25:50.990
When I reveal the vote, the
evicted houseguest will have

25:50.990 --> 25:54.990
just a few moments to say
goodbye, gather her belongings,

25:54.990 --> 25:58.990
and walk out the front door.

25:58.990 --> 26:03.990
By a vote of
7-2, Da'vonne,

26:03.990 --> 26:10.990
you are evicted from the "big
brother" house.

26:10.990 --> 26:12.990
>> I love you too.

26:12.990 --> 26:18.540
.

26:25.990 --> 26:27.990
Bye!

26:27.990 --> 26:30.990
(Applause)
(Cheers and applause)

27:03.990 --> 27:08.990
(Applause)
>> Thank you, guys.

27:16.950 --> 27:17.990
Thank you so much.

27:17.990 --> 27:19.410
Julie: Da'vonne.

27:19.540 --> 27:20.990
Jewel.

27:20.990 --> 27:22.700
Ulie: You were look act the
monitor watching what was going

27:22.830 --> 27:25.990
on in the house you used to call
home.

27:25.990 --> 27:27.950
>> Yeah.

27:27.990 --> 27:29.990
Julie: You got a huge round
of applause.

27:29.990 --> 27:34.990
>> I thought you were all going
to hate me.

27:34.990 --> 27:36.000
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: Let's talk about this

27:36.120 --> 27:40.990
game because you won the power
of the "last laugh," but you did

27:40.990 --> 27:42.990
not get the "last laugh"
tonight.

27:42.990 --> 27:43.990
>> No.

27:43.990 --> 27:46.990
Julie: However, you did
figure out a big twist in the

27:46.990 --> 27:47.990
game.

27:47.990 --> 27:48.990
>> The twins!

27:48.990 --> 27:49.990
Julie: Yes!

27:49.990 --> 27:52.990
I am here to confirm to you that
Liz has been switching in and

27:52.990 --> 27:54.990
out with her twin every few
days.

27:54.990 --> 27:59.990
Her identical twin, who is named
Julia.

27:59.990 --> 28:00.990
>> Oh.

28:00.990 --> 28:02.990
Julie: When you were on to
this, you didn't keep it to

28:02.990 --> 28:03.990
yourself.

28:03.990 --> 28:04.410
>> Uh-hmm.

28:04.540 --> 28:06.990
Julie: Was that a mistake?

28:06.990 --> 28:10.990
You waited to confront -- to
talk to the twins.

28:10.990 --> 28:11.990
>> Yeah.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.540
I told her -- because I thought
I could scare her into voting

28:14.700 --> 28:15.990
for me.

28:15.990 --> 28:17.990
>> Julie: But you had already
told others in the house at that

28:17.990 --> 28:18.990
point.

28:18.990 --> 28:19.990
>> And then that made it the
truth.

28:19.990 --> 28:25.990
Because it was like, you do have
a pack of people and I could

28:25.990 --> 28:26.990
protect you.

28:26.990 --> 28:28.990
So I thought I could scare her
into getting her vote.

28:28.990 --> 28:30.990
Maybe not.

28:30.990 --> 28:32.290
>> Julie: Do you think it would
have worked better if you went

28:32.410 --> 28:34.990
to her first and said, let's
work together?

28:34.990 --> 28:35.990
>> Yeah.

28:35.990 --> 28:37.950
Definitely.

28:37.990 --> 28:37.990
>> Julie: Mm.

28:37.990 --> 28:39.000
Definitely, definitely.

28:39.120 --> 28:42.990
Julie: With everything that
happened in that crazy house so

28:42.990 --> 28:46.990
far, you would think Audrey was
the one everyone was gunning

28:46.990 --> 28:46.990
for.

28:46.990 --> 28:48.410
>> Uh-hmm.

28:48.540 --> 28:49.540
Julie: How the heck did you
end up sitting here with me and

28:49.700 --> 28:50.990
not Audrey?

28:50.990 --> 28:51.990
>> Because they cowards.

28:51.990 --> 28:57.990
(Laughter)
>> Julie: What are they afraid

28:57.990 --> 28:58.990
of?

28:58.990 --> 29:00.950
>> I think the people in the
house are afraid of what you

29:00.990 --> 29:03.000
guys are going to think if they
nominate her because of who she

29:03.120 --> 29:04.950
is.

29:04.990 --> 29:07.990
And I have to explain to them
Audrey the person is not Audrey

29:07.990 --> 29:08.990
the player.

29:08.990 --> 29:09.990
And those are two different
people.

29:09.990 --> 29:12.990
So I understand and I respect
her for coming on the show and

29:12.990 --> 29:16.990
doing what she's doing, but as a
player, she gotta go!

29:16.990 --> 29:19.410
>> Julie: So you're saying they
don't want to publicly put

29:19.540 --> 29:23.990
Audrey, who has come out to say
that she's transgender, as an

29:23.990 --> 29:25.830
evicted houseguest --
>> yes.

29:25.950 --> 29:27.990
Julie: -- Or even as a
nominated houseguest?

29:27.990 --> 29:28.120
>> Yes.

29:28.290 --> 29:28.990
Nobody wants to do it.

29:28.990 --> 29:29.990
>> Julie: Wow.

29:29.990 --> 29:30.990
Nobody wants to do it.

29:30.990 --> 29:31.990
Julie: Wow.

29:31.990 --> 29:33.990
And I called that from day
two, which is why I said I would

29:33.990 --> 29:34.990
work with her.

29:34.990 --> 29:37.700
>> Julie: Is that going to cost
some of these people this game

29:37.830 --> 29:41.700
if they keep letting her week
after week go by?

29:41.830 --> 29:43.290
>> She's going to fly all the
way to $500,000.

29:43.410 --> 29:48.990
>> Julie: What to you think
ultimately cost you this game?

29:48.990 --> 29:50.990
>> Being very vocal.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.950
I think that cost me this game.

29:52.990 --> 29:56.990
I think when I noticed certain
things, I should have just shut

29:56.990 --> 29:59.990
up and went in my own private
corner and just kept it to

29:59.990 --> 30:00.540
myself.

30:00.700 --> 30:02.830
But the minute I decided, you
know what?

30:02.950 --> 30:03.990
We all know she lyin'.

30:03.990 --> 30:06.990
Let's get together as a house,
even for this one week and put

30:06.990 --> 30:08.830
her up there.

30:08.950 --> 30:10.990
That one moment sent me home.

30:10.990 --> 30:11.990
>> Julie: But that's you.

30:11.990 --> 30:12.990
It's who you are.

30:12.990 --> 30:16.000
So if you had a chance to do it
all over again, would you do it

30:16.120 --> 30:16.990
differently?

30:16.990 --> 30:17.990
>> Exactly the same.

30:17.990 --> 30:18.990
Julie: Because?

30:18.990 --> 30:20.990
That's just me.

30:20.990 --> 30:22.990
That's just me.

30:22.990 --> 30:24.990
>> Julie: Well, in the event
that you were the one evicted

30:24.990 --> 30:27.990
tonight, Da'vonne, your
housemates taped some goodbye

30:27.990 --> 30:28.830
messages.

30:28.950 --> 30:29.990
Let's look over here, watch and
listen.

30:29.990 --> 30:31.990
>> I'm not ready.

30:31.990 --> 30:33.990
Mama Da', it's been a long
three weeks.

30:33.990 --> 30:35.990
You were my girl on day one.

30:35.990 --> 30:36.990
And unfortunately, we had a
little falling out.

30:36.990 --> 30:39.700
You know, we never really
established that trust after

30:39.830 --> 30:40.990
that.

30:40.990 --> 30:41.990
I got so much love for you in my
heart, and I'm really looking

30:41.990 --> 30:46.990
forward to hopefully seeing you
outside this house.

30:46.990 --> 30:47.990
>> Da'vonne, karma just called
and it looks like you have a

30:47.990 --> 30:50.990
dose of your own medicine
waiting for you outside the "big

30:50.990 --> 30:52.700
brother" house.

30:52.830 --> 30:52.990
>> Bye.

30:52.990 --> 30:53.990
Sorry, girl.

30:53.990 --> 30:56.830
Da'vonne, my one and only
love.

30:56.950 --> 31:02.990
I would have been completely
lost without you here.

31:02.990 --> 31:04.990
Know everything I do in this
game now I'm doing for you.

31:04.990 --> 31:10.700
I will win this for us.

31:10.830 --> 31:14.410
>> So you had some suspicions
about me being a twin.

31:14.540 --> 31:14.990
You were right.

31:14.990 --> 31:15.990
I'm Liz.

31:15.990 --> 31:16.990
And.

31:16.990 --> 31:17.990
>> And I'm Julia.

31:17.990 --> 31:19.950
You blew up our game and now
you got to go.

31:19.990 --> 31:20.990
>> Bye.

31:20.990 --> 31:21.990
(Laughter).

31:21.990 --> 31:23.540
>> Julie: Da'vonne, despite
that goodbye message from

31:23.700 --> 31:25.990
Audrey, she did vote to evict
Meg tonight.

31:25.990 --> 31:27.120
>> Oh, she did?

31:27.290 --> 31:29.990
Julie: Your reaction?

31:29.990 --> 31:31.830
She wanted to work with me so
I see it.

31:31.950 --> 31:32.990
She was loyal.

31:32.990 --> 31:33.990
All right, Audrey.

31:33.990 --> 31:34.990
I'll give you that.

31:34.990 --> 31:35.990
(Laughter).

31:35.990 --> 31:36.000
>> Julie: Final thoughts?

31:36.120 --> 31:37.990
Great experience.

31:37.990 --> 31:38.990
I thank God for it.

31:38.990 --> 31:39.990
I'm ready to see my child.

31:39.990 --> 31:41.120
I don't see her!

31:41.290 --> 31:42.990
(Laughter)
But, yeah, it was great meeting

31:42.990 --> 31:43.290
you.

31:43.410 --> 31:44.120
Beautiful as always.

31:44.290 --> 31:44.990
>> Julie: Thank you.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.290
You will see your baby soon
enough.

31:46.410 --> 31:47.990
Go take good care of her.

31:47.990 --> 31:48.990
>> Thank you.

31:48.990 --> 31:49.000
Julie: And we thank you.

31:49.120 --> 31:50.120
Stay right there.

31:50.290 --> 31:54.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: It's now time for

31:54.990 --> 31:57.700
another "bb takeover."

31:57.830 --> 32:01.990
And here to kick it off is super
bowl champion rob gronkowski.

32:01.990 --> 32:03.990
>> Ooh.

32:03.990 --> 32:08.990
♪ Get readied for a takeover!

32:08.990 --> 32:13.990
♪
>> what's it going to be?!

32:13.990 --> 32:13.990
A?

32:13.990 --> 32:15.990
Hat's up, people?

32:15.990 --> 32:18.990
I'm super bowl champion rob
gronkowski but my friends call

32:18.990 --> 32:19.990
me gronk.

32:19.990 --> 32:20.990
>> All right.

32:20.990 --> 32:21.990
What up?

32:21.990 --> 32:26.990
I hope you're ready for
another bb blb because it's --

32:26.990 --> 32:28.120
"bb takeover" because it's party
week.

32:28.290 --> 32:30.990
That means we're going to party
all weeklong.

32:30.990 --> 32:33.990
(Cheers and applause)
Fyi, I don't like have-notes.

32:33.990 --> 32:36.990
So there will be no have-nots at
my party.

32:36.990 --> 32:39.000
(Cheers and applause)
But what I do like is winners.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.990
So you may want to try and win
the competition this week, which

32:41.990 --> 32:43.990
starts right now.

32:43.990 --> 32:45.990
Get to the backyard for the head
of household competition.

32:45.990 --> 32:48.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Yeah.

32:56.990 --> 33:00.990
Julie: Up next, it's a new
week, which means it's time to

33:00.990 --> 33:02.990
crown two new heads of
households.

33:02.990 --> 33:04.990
Stay with us.

33:04.990 --> 33:06.540
(Cheers and applause)

33:24.990 --> 33:26.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: Welcome back to "big

33:26.990 --> 33:27.990
brother."

33:27.990 --> 33:30.990
It is now time to crown two new
heads of households.

33:30.990 --> 33:33.990
Each must nominate two
houseguests for eviction.

33:34.990 --> 33:37.990
Who will become the two most
powerful people in the game?

33:37.990 --> 33:42.990
Let's head to the backyard and
find out.

33:42.990 --> 33:45.990
Houseguests, the power is up for
grabs.

33:45.990 --> 33:48.990
Shelli, as outgoing head of
household, you are not eligible

33:48.990 --> 33:52.990
to compete.

33:52.990 --> 33:56.990
As everyone knows, gronk loves a
good party.

33:56.990 --> 34:00.990
And any party of his wouldn't be
complete without a game of

34:00.990 --> 34:01.990
"gronk pong."

34:01.990 --> 34:04.990
Here's how it works.

34:04.990 --> 34:07.990
One at a time, each houseguest
will step up to the launcher and

34:07.990 --> 34:11.540
shoot their ball toward the
cups.

34:11.700 --> 34:15.990
Each cup represents a different
number -- 1 to 55.

34:15.990 --> 34:20.990
The blue cups represent the
highest numbers -- 49 through

34:20.990 --> 34:23.990
55.

34:23.990 --> 34:27.000
The two houseguests with the
highest scores when everyone has

34:27.120 --> 34:30.990
taken a turn will be the new
heads of households.

34:30.990 --> 34:36.700
If your ball does not land in a
cup, your score will be zero.

34:36.830 --> 34:40.990
If we have a tie, we'll go to a
tiebreaker.

34:40.990 --> 34:41.950
Everyoned?

34:41.990 --> 34:43.990
>> Yes.

34:43.990 --> 34:45.990
Everyone understand?

34:45.990 --> 34:46.990
>> Yes.

34:46.990 --> 34:47.990
Julie: Good.

34:47.990 --> 34:48.990
The order was determined earlier
by random draw and, Liz, you are

34:48.990 --> 34:49.990
first.

34:49.990 --> 34:52.000
Please place your ball and take
your shot.

34:58.990 --> 35:02.990
>> No pressure.

35:02.990 --> 35:03.990
Woo.

35:03.990 --> 35:06.990
Oh!

35:06.990 --> 35:07.410
Woo!

35:07.540 --> 35:07.990
Julie: 23.

35:07.990 --> 35:08.000
All right.

35:08.120 --> 35:09.990
Step down.

35:09.990 --> 35:12.990
You're currently in the lead.

35:12.990 --> 35:13.990
Nope.

35:13.990 --> 35:16.990
Liz, you can go behind that
first monitor, and it has your

35:16.990 --> 35:21.120
name and your score, 23.

35:21.290 --> 35:22.990
The other way -- there you go!

35:22.990 --> 35:25.700
(Laughter)
Jackie

35:25.830 --> 35:26.990
come on up.

35:26.990 --> 35:31.950
When you get up there, you can
go ahead and place the ball and

35:31.990 --> 35:39.990
take your shot.

35:39.990 --> 35:41.990
I'm sorry, Jackie.

35:41.990 --> 35:42.000
Score zero.

35:42.000 --> 35:42.990
Step down.

35:42.990 --> 35:44.990
You're eliminated from this
competition.

35:44.990 --> 35:49.990
John,
step on up.

35:49.990 --> 35:55.990
Go ahead and place your balls.

35:55.990 --> 35:56.990
>> Nice.

35:56.990 --> 35:57.990
Julie: Sorry, John.

35:57.990 --> 35:58.950
Also zero.

35:58.990 --> 35:58.990
Step down.

35:58.990 --> 36:06.990
James,
step up.

36:06.990 --> 36:16.410
Go ahead and place your ball and
take your shot.

36:16.540 --> 36:16.990
>> There you go.

36:16.990 --> 36:17.700
Julie: Also a 23.

36:17.830 --> 36:17.990
All right.

36:17.990 --> 36:19.990
Stand next to Liz.

36:19.990 --> 36:23.990
We have a tie so far.

36:23.990 --> 36:28.990
Audrey, you're up.

36:28.990 --> 36:37.990
Go ahead and take your shot.

36:41.990 --> 36:42.410
17.

36:42.540 --> 36:42.990
All right.

36:42.990 --> 36:43.990
You're still in this game.

36:43.990 --> 36:47.990
Oh, no -- ooh, no, you're not.

36:47.990 --> 36:48.990
I'm sorry.

36:48.990 --> 36:50.990
Step on down.

36:50.990 --> 36:50.990
Clay.

36:50.990 --> 36:52.990
Step on up.

36:52.990 --> 36:58.990
When you get up there, go ahead
and take your shot.

36:58.990 --> 37:06.990
You have to beat 23 to stay in
the game, houseguests.

37:06.990 --> 37:09.990
>> Ooh.

37:09.990 --> 37:10.990
Julie: Sorry.

37:10.990 --> 37:11.700
That's a 6.

37:11.830 --> 37:12.990
Step down, Clay.

37:12.990 --> 37:17.700
Jeff, step on up.

37:17.830 --> 37:20.830
And go ahead and take your shot.

37:31.990 --> 37:33.410
>> Ooh.

37:33.540 --> 37:36.990
Julie: 14.

37:36.990 --> 37:37.700
Sorry.

37:37.830 --> 37:39.700
Step down, Jeff.

37:39.830 --> 37:45.700
Becky, step on up.

37:45.830 --> 37:48.830
And take your shot.

37:55.990 --> 37:56.990
>> All right.

37:56.990 --> 37:57.990
Julie: That would be a zero.

37:57.990 --> 37:58.990
Sorry, Becky.

37:58.990 --> 37:59.990
Step down.

37:59.990 --> 38:03.000
Austin, you're up.

38:10.290 --> 38:12.990
28.

38:12.990 --> 38:12.990
(Applause).

38:12.990 --> 38:13.990
>> Oh.

38:13.990 --> 38:17.990
Julie: Nicely done, in the
lead with 28 is Austin it.

38:17.990 --> 38:20.990
Jason, come on up.

38:29.990 --> 38:30.830
Sorry, Jason.

38:30.950 --> 38:31.830
Back to zero.

38:31.950 --> 38:32.540
Step down.

38:32.700 --> 38:32.990
Meg, you're up.

38:32.990 --> 38:35.990
Step on up.

38:46.830 --> 38:46.990
That's a 1.

38:46.990 --> 38:48.540
That won't do it.

38:48.700 --> 38:50.950
Step down, Meg.

38:50.990 --> 38:57.990
Steve, you're up.

38:57.990 --> 39:06.990
You can go ahead and set the
ball and take your shot.

39:06.990 --> 39:07.990
>> Woo.

39:07.990 --> 39:08.950
!

39:08.990 --> 39:09.990
Julie: Oh, sorry, that's a
zero.

39:09.990 --> 39:13.990
Just to recap, we have Austin in
the lead with 28, Liz and James

39:14.000 --> 39:18.120
tied for second place with 23
points.

39:18.290 --> 39:19.990
Last houseguest is Vanessa.

39:19.990 --> 39:22.990
Step on up.

39:22.990 --> 39:25.990
And when you're ready, take your
shot, Vanessa.

39:36.990 --> 39:37.000
>> Woo.

39:37.000 --> 39:37.990
Julie: Three-way tie.

39:37.990 --> 39:38.990
Okay.

39:38.990 --> 39:40.990
We have going to a tiebreaker.

39:40.990 --> 39:43.990
We have to break the tie between
Liz, James and Vanessa.

39:43.990 --> 39:44.990
We're doing a shoot-out.

39:44.990 --> 39:49.290
Each of you please grab your
tiebreaker ball.

39:49.410 --> 39:52.120
You will each take one shot.

39:52.290 --> 39:53.950
Quickly.

39:53.990 --> 39:55.540
The person with the highest
score will become the new heads

39:55.700 --> 39:56.950
of household.

39:56.990 --> 39:57.000
With Austin.

39:57.120 --> 40:02.990
Liz, you are first.

40:02.990 --> 40:03.950
Quickly, please.

40:03.990 --> 40:04.990
We have a live show.

40:04.990 --> 40:12.990
(Laughter)
22.

40:12.990 --> 40:13.990
James, you're up.

40:13.990 --> 40:17.990
22 is what you need to beat.

40:17.990 --> 40:25.990
Quickly, please.

40:25.990 --> 40:26.990
35 will do it.

40:26.990 --> 40:27.990
All right.

40:27.990 --> 40:29.990
(Applause)
Let's see if you can beat that,

40:29.990 --> 40:32.990
Vanessa.

40:41.990 --> 40:45.410
>> Oh!

40:45.540 --> 40:46.990
Julie: 52 it is.

40:46.990 --> 40:48.990
Congratulations to Vanessa and
Austin!

40:48.990 --> 40:51.990
The two of you are the new heads
of households!

40:51.990 --> 40:54.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: Who will

41:19.990 --> 41:21.990
Vanessa and Austin
nominate for eviction?

41:21.990 --> 41:24.410
And who will win the battle of
the block and save themselves?

41:24.540 --> 41:26.410
Stay with us.

41:26.540 --> 41:28.990

41:53.990 --> 41:57.990
We have a huge week ahead of us.

the block.

42:02.990 --> 42:07.990
Then on Wednesday, the power of
veto is back up for grabs.
