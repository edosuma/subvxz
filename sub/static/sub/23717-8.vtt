WEBVTT

00:15.390 --> 00:17.017
Oh, my God!
What's wrong with your faces?

00:17.142 --> 00:20.353
The broadcasting guys are coming tomorrow.
We must look good.

00:20.478 --> 00:23.481
You're famous now. You'll be on TV.

00:23.606 --> 00:24.649
Right.

00:24.774 --> 00:28.194
I'll be on TV,
but why are you wearing facial masks?

00:30.447 --> 00:32.073
You should do one, too.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.992
HD TV shows

00:34.117 --> 00:36.494
each and every pore on your face.
How dirty would that be?

00:36.619 --> 00:37.787
Here.

00:38.955 --> 00:41.082
All of you must behave tomorrow.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.042
Don't embarrass me again, please!

00:43.168 --> 00:47.088
Don't worry.
What do you think we are?

00:47.213 --> 00:49.758
We'll stay out of your way.

00:52.135 --> 00:54.095
We're filming now.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.474
This is a documentary about
the daily lives of webtoon artists.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.726
Just do what you'd usually do.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.604
"Usually"?

01:07.442 --> 01:09.319
- No!
- Don't do it!

01:11.488 --> 01:14.532
- Can I draw cartoons as usual?
- Yes, sure.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.203
- Let's shoot now.
- Wait.

01:18.828 --> 01:21.414
Uh... go!

01:23.917 --> 01:25.710
3 MINUTES LATER

01:25.835 --> 01:27.212
10 MINUTES LATER

01:27.337 --> 01:29.422
40 MINUTES LATER

01:29.547 --> 01:32.509
2 HOURS LATER

01:33.218 --> 01:34.761
Oh, what happened?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.263
Oh, my gosh!

01:37.388 --> 01:39.557
It's so boring.

01:39.682 --> 01:43.561
- I have to go. I'm meeting someone.
- Wait for me.

01:45.188 --> 01:51.194
Do you actually sit like this
and work all day long?

01:51.319 --> 01:53.404
Yeah, mostly.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.865
You're different from the others.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.575
What do they do?

01:57.700 --> 01:59.202
They do lots of things.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.788
They go out, walk around
and meet people.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.540
Some of them have imported cars.

02:03.665 --> 02:06.543
Their videos are quite interesting.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.130
Oh, I see.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.508
I do that, too.
I do everything they do.

02:13.633 --> 02:17.887
- Are you going to show that from now on?
- Yeah, sure.

02:18.012 --> 02:22.016
DOCUMENTARY

02:22.142 --> 02:23.643
Nice talking to you, man.

02:23.768 --> 02:28.273
We planned to meet a long time ago.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.316
It was great to see you.

02:30.441 --> 02:33.695
Me, too.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.281
Don't you have to go now?

02:40.994 --> 02:42.370
Okay, cut!

02:43.955 --> 02:46.583
Thank you for coming on such short notice.
Where's your car?

02:48.960 --> 02:50.336
In the parking lot.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.882
Do you really have to do this?

02:54.007 --> 02:56.467
All the others have imported cars.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.095
- Bye.
- Thanks, man.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.935
Seok, we're ready.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.563
- Shall we go?
- Sure.

03:09.105 --> 03:12.942
When I go out,
people may recognize me.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.987
Anyway, let's go.

03:20.325 --> 03:23.453
This is my buddy, "Jonathan."

03:29.626 --> 03:31.586
They all look alike.

03:45.808 --> 03:50.230
Okay, enough searching.
Shall I go now?

03:51.189 --> 03:53.691
Hey, you're blocking me.
Could you move your car?

03:53.816 --> 03:55.693
Oh, sure.

04:10.583 --> 04:11.876
Hurry up, man!

04:21.552 --> 04:24.222
- Could you help me?
- With what?

04:24.347 --> 04:25.974
My wrist hurts, so--

04:33.022 --> 04:35.608
I love taking a walk
around my neighborhood alone.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.738
Shh! The kids are playing soccer.

04:41.447 --> 04:45.285
I love playing with the kids
in my neighborhood.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.414
Pass me, pass me the ball!

04:55.253 --> 04:59.132
Why are you bothering the kids?

05:00.174 --> 05:03.678
I kicked the ball, but he--
he was standing right there.

05:03.803 --> 05:07.432
Why the hell did you kick the ball?

05:08.057 --> 05:11.561
I love being alone
in the afternoon sunlight.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.439
With a cup of espresso.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.071
Hello.

05:22.196 --> 05:25.074
- Aren't you Seok Cho?
- Huh?

05:26.492 --> 05:27.744
Yes, I'm Seok Cho.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.329
I told you so!

05:29.454 --> 05:31.456
Do you like "The Sound of Your Heart"?
Want me to sign that?

05:31.581 --> 05:34.500
- No, not really.
- Don't be shy, kid.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.878
It's okay. I'll sign it for you.

05:50.683 --> 05:51.809
Oh, look!

05:52.727 --> 05:54.395
Wow, it's Gwang-su Lee!

05:55.271 --> 05:58.900
He's the artist of the most
popular webtoon,  Noblesse!

05:59.984 --> 06:01.778
- Gwang-su Lee!
- You're so handsome!

06:02.570 --> 06:03.613
Oh, thank you.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.492
- I didn't finish my signature yet.
- It's okay.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.620
- I'm not okay.
- No, thanks. Take the notebook!

06:10.745 --> 06:12.747
- Oh, so handsome.
- He's good-looking.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.957
- I'm a big fan.
- Hi, Mr. Lee.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.167
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

06:16.292 --> 06:18.920
- We're filming a documentary.
- Yeah, I see.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.214
- Do you know Seok Cho?
- Who?

06:21.339 --> 06:23.800
No, is he a webtoon artist?

06:23.925 --> 06:25.551
I don't know him.

06:32.475 --> 06:36.020
- Great job, guys!
- You, too.

06:36.145 --> 06:37.063
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.106
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.025
- It's okay.
- Good night.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.906
Oh, I could've died!

06:47.031 --> 06:49.033
They said it wouldn't take long,
but it took all day!

06:49.158 --> 06:50.326
You think I have nothing to do?

06:50.451 --> 06:52.537
I'll never do this again, jerks!

06:54.580 --> 06:55.998
What an terrible day!

07:06.217 --> 07:10.388
- Hello?
- I realized I left a camera there.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.515
Can I go get it early in the morning?

07:12.640 --> 07:14.517
A camera? Sure.

07:14.642 --> 07:18.020
It's an expensive one.
Please, don't touch it.

07:22.358 --> 07:23.609
A camera?

07:38.583 --> 07:41.961
It's expensive.
I shouldn't touch it.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.547
But I have no clothes on.

07:44.672 --> 07:48.092
Wait, I can stay in the blind spots.

07:52.388 --> 07:55.266
Okay, I can avoid the angle.

08:16.621 --> 08:17.788
Are the TV guys gone?

08:17.914 --> 08:20.082
Those jerks made a mess of the place.

08:20.208 --> 08:23.294
The producer's feet smelled so foul.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.630
- Shh.
- They--

08:25.755 --> 08:27.423
Come here.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.552
They left a camera here.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.722
It's right there.

08:36.140 --> 08:40.102
It's recording everything now.

08:40.228 --> 08:42.688
We should act naturally.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.034
PERFECT ATTENDANCE AWARD
SEOK CHO

08:55.785 --> 08:57.537
PERFECT ATTENDANCE AWARD
SEOK CHO

09:00.873 --> 09:04.085
Dinner is ready, everyone.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.009
Seok, where is your father?

09:15.638 --> 09:16.847
I'm coming.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.433
Are you going to a party?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.602
These are my regular clothes.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.689
I wear this every day. Have a seat.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.484
Let's sit.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.331
This is a lot of food.

09:42.456 --> 09:46.460
What are you talking about?
We eat like this every day.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.130
Son, what would you like?

09:52.800 --> 09:55.261
Oh, good! My precious son.

09:55.386 --> 09:59.015
A gift from heaven! My precious son!

10:02.059 --> 10:03.644
Oh, what is this?

10:03.769 --> 10:04.812
CHO'S CHICKEN

10:04.937 --> 10:09.317
Isn't this the best chicken in town,
Cho's Chicken?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.444
When did you order it?

10:14.697 --> 10:15.990
Fresh ingredients and spices!

10:16.115 --> 10:22.330
Cho's Chicken uses fresh oil every day.
The best chicken in town, Cho's Chicken!

10:22.455 --> 10:26.542
- The phone number is....
- Call 02-254-8282 now!

10:31.255 --> 10:33.090
I'm home!

10:33.215 --> 10:34.884
Jun, come here.

10:37.011 --> 10:40.348
- They forgot to take that.
- Oh.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.016
Don't do anything stupid in front of it.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.142
I see.

10:57.740 --> 11:02.662
Hi, there. I'm Jun Cho.

11:02.787 --> 11:07.291
I'm Seok's brother, and a VJ
for an Internet broadcasting station.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.627
I have so many talents.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.296
Please, watch my show,
and call me anytime.

11:12.421 --> 11:16.425
I'll try my hardest to be the best actor.

11:16.550 --> 11:18.260
I will act happy,

11:18.386 --> 11:21.847
and then express utter rage.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.724
Look, there she goes!

11:26.852 --> 11:29.188
Next, I'll play two roles.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.232
How could you do this to me?

11:31.357 --> 11:33.484
No, I didn't do it.

11:33.609 --> 11:35.111
Come, come here.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.655
No!

11:37.780 --> 11:39.490
No, no!

11:39.615 --> 11:45.871
Mommy, Mommy, my butt is on fire!

11:47.415 --> 11:48.541
- Hello, Seok.
- Hi.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.334
- I'm here to get the camera.
- Come on in.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.381
Here it is.

11:55.506 --> 11:56.382
Ah...

11:59.927 --> 12:03.222
I have to go do some filming now.
Have a good day.

12:11.564 --> 12:16.986
I'm not sure, but I remember
I've wanted to do it since I was two.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.113
I can't remember exactly.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.157
My parents said--

12:23.325 --> 12:26.829
Seok asked me if he could use my car.

12:26.954 --> 12:29.331
Okay, I have an interview, too.

12:43.512 --> 12:46.056
Turn on the TV, right now!

12:46.182 --> 12:49.852
My son is going to be on TV!

12:49.977 --> 12:53.898
And me, too. Yes, yes.

12:54.023 --> 12:56.066
I told all my co-workers

12:56.192 --> 12:58.903
that the whole world is watching
my family.

12:59.028 --> 13:02.615
Don't make a big deal out of it.
This is just the beginning!

13:02.740 --> 13:03.616
It's on!

13:03.741 --> 13:04.825
THE HUMAN STORY

13:05.618 --> 13:07.536
WEBTOON ARTIST, SEOK CHO

13:07.661 --> 13:10.831
The webtoon artist,
Seok Cho, is struggling

13:10.956 --> 13:13.209
in adverse circumstances.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.127
His parents' unhappy marriage.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.754
There's no food I like!

13:16.879 --> 13:18.088
You didn't eat?

13:18.214 --> 13:19.840
- You stuffed yourself!
- I ate nothing!

13:22.343 --> 13:27.056
- I was--
- What is this?

13:27.181 --> 13:29.266
The mentally-disturbed brother.

13:33.229 --> 13:37.858
You betrayed me,
I've never betrayed you.

13:37.983 --> 13:43.239
I'll kill you!
No, let go of me!

13:43.364 --> 13:45.366
My butt is on fire!

13:47.076 --> 13:49.870
Feeling oppressed by the weight of life,

13:49.995 --> 13:53.332
even Seok begins to show
strange symptoms.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.376
Skepticism about his own job.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.587
Oh, I could've died!
I'll never do this again!

13:58.712 --> 13:59.964
What an terrible day!

14:03.300 --> 14:04.677
Violence.

14:10.015 --> 14:14.144
And bizarre behavior.

14:19.233 --> 14:23.988
Now, it is the time for us to offer them
a warm helping hand.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.926
SHANGHAI, CHINA

14:47.553 --> 14:48.596
- Boss.
- Yeah?

14:48.721 --> 14:50.848
- You've been here before, right?
- Yes.

14:50.973 --> 14:55.019
- Do you know a good place to eat?
- I know a popular restaurant.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.521
- Let's go there.
- Okay.

14:59.815 --> 15:02.568
- Do you speak Chinese?
- No.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.822
I'm fluent in English,

15:06.947 --> 15:10.159
but they don't speak English in China.

15:10.284 --> 15:15.080
My TOEIC score in English is 900,
but that's useless in China.

15:15.664 --> 15:18.584
Really? Same here.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.920
900 is the minimum.

15:21.045 --> 15:25.174
- Why have we been sent to China?
- Yeah.

15:25.299 --> 15:28.427
Shall we communicate
through body language?

15:30.304 --> 15:31.347
HERE

15:35.267 --> 15:37.311
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

15:37.728 --> 15:40.564
CHICKEN

15:41.440 --> 15:43.609
CHICKEN SKEWERS

15:44.693 --> 15:46.236
THREE, PLEASE

15:49.490 --> 15:51.033
CRABS, TOO

15:51.825 --> 15:52.785
Do you know what a crab tastes like?

15:52.910 --> 15:54.995
Crab, crab.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.122
Sir, what are you doing?

15:57.247 --> 15:58.582
You shouldn't be doing this here.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.125
Is this your first time visiting us?

16:00.250 --> 16:03.504
If so, I'd recommend
our signature dish, Xiaolongbao.

16:03.629 --> 16:04.797
If you want to fancy things up,

16:04.922 --> 16:09.259
I can always recommend
our Fotiaoqiang soup with truffle dishes.

16:13.430 --> 16:17.226
Why don't you order first?
I have to send an e-mail now.

16:17.351 --> 16:20.354
If only my mother had come--

16:21.188 --> 16:24.984
Mom, what time is it in Korea?

16:25.109 --> 16:29.530
Hello, yeah, thank you. Yeah.

16:35.369 --> 16:38.872
What a shame!
I can't speak a word of English!

16:39.999 --> 16:43.669
Attention, please.
A fire drill is about to begin.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.714
Guests should remain calm
until further notice.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.590
What is he saying?
I can't understand a word.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.054
Attention, please.
Fire drill is about to begin.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.723
We can't understand English, either.

16:55.848 --> 16:56.890
Guests should remain calm
until further notice.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.312
Fire drill is about to begin.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.315
What? Fire? Fi-- fire!

17:05.441 --> 17:06.650
Right? Fire!

17:07.776 --> 17:08.986
That means we're on fire!

17:09.111 --> 17:13.032
I told you so!
I am good at English! It's true!

17:13.490 --> 17:14.408
That way!

17:14.533 --> 17:18.454
FIRE IN CHINA

17:19.246 --> 17:20.998
No, no, no!

17:21.123 --> 17:23.000
- Let's get out of here.
- Wait!

17:23.125 --> 17:26.253
Calm down.
We need something to block the smoke.

17:26.378 --> 17:30.924
Shit, I saw it on TV
how to make a gas mask with a bra.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.427
There's no way
we can't get those here, you moron!

17:39.808 --> 17:43.562
Here is something I brought
just in case.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.695
Don't worry. I have a few more.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.498
I don't know why,
but I like the lace one today.

18:03.832 --> 18:04.750
Put it on.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.216
We must survive.

18:21.475 --> 18:22.476
- Fire!
- Fire!

18:22.601 --> 18:23.435
- Fire!
- Fire!

18:23.560 --> 18:26.772
Fire! Come out, hurry!

18:26.897 --> 18:28.023
- Are we really on fire?
- Yes!

18:28.148 --> 18:29.775
That's why he was saying fire!

18:29.900 --> 18:32.569
You must remain calm
at a moment like this!

18:32.694 --> 18:34.321
Wear them over your mouth!

18:34.446 --> 18:35.739
Follow me, and you'll be okay!

18:35.864 --> 18:37.699
- Come on?
- What's this?

18:38.033 --> 18:40.077
- Fire!
- Fire!

18:40.202 --> 18:43.747
What have you prepared for me?

18:43.872 --> 18:46.708
A really, really big surprise.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.836
Don't peek!

18:48.961 --> 18:51.964
- Fire!
- Come on!

18:53.715 --> 18:54.633
The flame's spreading here!

18:55.217 --> 18:57.052
Let's save lives together!

18:57.177 --> 19:01.765
- Where shall we go today? To America?
- No, to Antarctica.

19:03.892 --> 19:04.810
- It's full of smoke here!
- Who are you?

19:05.477 --> 19:07.271
- You're in danger!
- Let go of me!

19:07.396 --> 19:08.981
This is the moment!

19:09.106 --> 19:11.150
- Don't worry.
- Let go of my hand!

19:14.444 --> 19:18.282
What is going on?
Is this your big surprise?

19:18.407 --> 19:19.241
Come on!

19:23.871 --> 19:25.831
I have one just like it.

19:32.629 --> 19:35.799
Fire! Come on out!

19:35.924 --> 19:37.384
What? Fire?

19:39.720 --> 19:40.721
Fire!

19:41.763 --> 19:44.850
Don't panic, people!
Follow me!

19:46.602 --> 19:48.395
What is his deal? Let's go!

19:49.313 --> 19:51.857
Baby, where are we going?

19:53.984 --> 19:54.818
Fire!

20:02.117 --> 20:03.243
Who are you?

20:03.368 --> 20:04.745
We're on fire, so--

20:04.870 --> 20:06.246
Get out!

20:06.371 --> 20:08.665
Fire, fire.

20:08.790 --> 20:09.666
- Hot, hot!
- Fire?

20:10.083 --> 20:12.127
- There is a fire?
- Fire?

20:12.252 --> 20:13.587
- There is a fire?
- There is a fire?

20:13.712 --> 20:14.796
- Really?
- Really?

20:14.922 --> 20:16.089
- There is a fire?
- There is a fire?

20:16.215 --> 20:18.175
Run! There is a fire!

20:19.843 --> 20:21.386
There's a fire!

20:22.387 --> 20:24.723
Oh, she's a Chinese actress!

20:35.817 --> 20:38.445
- Go, go!
- Let's go!

20:38.570 --> 20:39.738
Fire!

20:39.863 --> 20:41.740
They do fire drills that loud?

20:42.449 --> 20:44.785
- Fire!
- Fire!

20:50.332 --> 20:54.127
You guys misunderstood!
It's not a fire. It's a fire drill.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.672
You, fire!

20:56.797 --> 20:58.882
You'll be barbecued. Barbeque.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.175
- Hot!
- Hot!

21:00.300 --> 21:02.052
- Okay?
- What is wrong with you people?

21:02.177 --> 21:05.555
We-- we'll help.
Escape. Escape, okay?

21:05.681 --> 21:07.307
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

21:27.953 --> 21:28.870
Is that toxic gas?

21:30.247 --> 21:33.000
People, toxic gas is spreading in here.

21:34.751 --> 21:35.627
I feel like I'm gonna puke!

21:42.175 --> 21:45.053
Are you okay?

21:46.763 --> 21:47.973
What are you doing? Come out!

21:48.098 --> 21:49.725
How long will it take
to go down the stairs?

21:49.850 --> 21:51.476
I'm going this way.

21:52.436 --> 21:55.272
No, no!

21:56.148 --> 21:57.441
No!

22:01.945 --> 22:05.657
It's dangerous to use an elevator.

22:13.290 --> 22:16.585
Let's get down the stairs.
Everyone is in danger.

22:27.721 --> 22:30.390
China is full of surprises, right?

22:30.515 --> 22:32.309
- Yes.
- Take as many pictures as you'd like.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.727
Okay.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.273
- Oh, no!
- What is it?

22:42.736 --> 22:43.904
Who are you?

22:56.708 --> 22:57.793
The 30th floor, too.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.837
The upper floors are already in flames!

23:00.962 --> 23:02.422
Everyone, go down!

23:05.050 --> 23:06.384
You go down.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.929
I can't go without saving
all the people up there.

23:09.679 --> 23:13.975
Are you crazy?
You could die trying to save them!

23:14.101 --> 23:20.357
Their lives are important, too.

23:21.108 --> 23:25.112
Jun, look at these people
who are relying on us and following us.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.155
Let's just go.

23:27.280 --> 23:30.075
Everything must be engulfed
in a sea of fire!

23:31.076 --> 23:34.329
Hey, I'm going back.
You guys are killing me.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.915
"Go back"? "Killing"?

23:38.208 --> 23:39.084
Are you going to sacrifice yourself?

23:40.335 --> 23:42.212
No!

23:42.879 --> 23:45.298
Don't try to stop me. I'm going!

23:50.428 --> 23:54.516
Let us not forget his sacrifice.

23:54.641 --> 23:58.436
Let's go down till the end.

24:05.485 --> 24:07.821
We can't go down, either!
What do we do now?

24:12.159 --> 24:15.829
Jun, I can't go on anymore.

24:16.329 --> 24:18.790
Don't say that!

24:23.503 --> 24:28.383
I wanted to save all of you,
but I'm sorry, I can't.

24:33.054 --> 24:35.640
But we have one last chance.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.476
The lobby is not too far.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.937
This may be our last moment.

24:41.062 --> 24:44.941
Let's say goodbye to the people we love.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.551
- Hello?
- Seok!

25:11.676 --> 25:12.552
What is it? Is something wrong?

25:12.677 --> 25:14.721
No, no.

25:15.722 --> 25:17.307
Please, take care of Mom and Dad.

25:17.849 --> 25:18.767
What are you talking about?

25:20.560 --> 25:24.814
I'm sorry for everything.
Please, forgive me.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.524
What's wrong with you?

25:26.650 --> 25:33.323
When I'm gone,
you'll have no brother, no friend.

25:33.448 --> 25:36.117
And no girlfriend, you poor thing!

25:36.910 --> 25:39.204
I've never told you this,

25:39.913 --> 25:43.208
- I love you.
- What a moron! Just hang up!

25:46.878 --> 25:48.255
Shit!

25:49.381 --> 25:50.924
I'm ready now.

25:57.764 --> 25:59.891
Let's survive!

26:00.016 --> 26:01.184
Let's go!

26:34.718 --> 26:38.179
Today, at a hotel in Shanghai,
a Korean man, Cho Jun was arrested

26:38.305 --> 26:41.016
for agitating the other guests
and causing outrageous mayhem.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.935
The reason for his rampage
is unknown.

26:44.519 --> 26:47.647
Listen to me!
I thought there was a real fire.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.149
That man is insane!

26:49.274 --> 26:52.360
That madman thought he was a hero
and was saving us.

26:52.485 --> 26:54.154
I was totally freaked out.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.989
That man is totally out of his mind.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.408
The guy said "Fire, fire,"
so I thought we were on fire.

26:58.533 --> 27:00.827
The guy who spoke English heard it, too.

27:01.453 --> 27:05.832
OUR TWISTED HERO

27:13.048 --> 27:14.299
JUN

27:20.096 --> 27:22.599
He's not answering.
Do you have anyone else in your family?

27:22.724 --> 27:25.602
010...

27:29.314 --> 27:33.943
- Hello?
- I'm an investigator, Ling Xiaoming.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.613
Your son, Jun Cho is in big trouble.

27:36.738 --> 27:39.157
You must come to China right away.

27:39.282 --> 27:41.659
I know you're voice phishing, you!

27:41.785 --> 27:43.203
Do you think I'm an easy target?

27:43.328 --> 27:46.873
If you call me once again,
I will pull your tongue out!

27:49.042 --> 27:51.461
Oh, my gosh! She is such a--

27:52.212 --> 27:53.588
Anyone else?

27:55.548 --> 27:56.841
010...

27:58.051 --> 28:01.638
I'm so bored. Is there anything fun to do?

28:07.185 --> 28:10.772
- Hello.
- I'm an investigator, Ling Xiaoming.

28:10.897 --> 28:13.983
Your son, Jun Cho,
is in big trouble.

28:14.109 --> 28:16.820
You must come to China right away.

28:19.697 --> 28:21.491
Did you just tell me to come to China?

28:21.825 --> 28:24.035
How did you know I'm from there?

28:24.327 --> 28:27.580
Do you want me to eliminate that man?

28:27.705 --> 28:30.166
What tools shall I bring with me?

28:30.750 --> 28:33.586
It's been a while
since I've touched my tools.

28:33.711 --> 28:37.757
My heart is pounding.

28:44.305 --> 28:45.306
How's that?

28:47.058 --> 28:48.685
Are they really your family?

28:48.810 --> 28:50.311
They can't be!

28:50.687 --> 28:53.106
He's suspicious. Take him right now!

28:54.399 --> 28:58.319
Wait. 010--

28:58.611 --> 28:59.821
Give me one more chance! Wait!

28:59.946 --> 29:01.072
010--
