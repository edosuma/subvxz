In the criminal justice system,

00:02.670 --> 00:04.205
sexually based offenses

00:04.238 --> 00:06.540
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.576
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.609 --> 00:10.511
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.544 --> 00:12.080
are members of an elite squad

00:12.113 --> 00:13.781
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.814 --> 00:16.684
These are their stories.

00:17.651 --> 00:21.155
[laughter]

00:21.189 --> 00:22.623
(woman)
Don't be crazy.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.625
(man)
Oh, you make me crazy.

00:24.658 --> 00:25.793
Oh, well,
we had a good time.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.795
Let's just
leave it at that.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.663
(man)
I can't.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.065
(woman)
Oh, you know,

00:31.099 --> 00:32.466
you need
to get dressed now and go.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.701
(man)
Let's talk about it in bed.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.269
(woman)
Come on, I mean it!

00:35.303 --> 00:37.438
I told you this was
going to be the last time.

00:37.471 --> 00:38.772
Enough! It's over!
Let's go to bed!

00:38.806 --> 00:41.542
Let go of me!
You're hurting me!
Come on!

00:41.575 --> 00:43.411
Get off right now!
I'm done with this!

00:43.444 --> 00:45.346
(man)
It's not up to you!

00:45.379 --> 00:46.780
I'm calling the cops!

00:46.814 --> 00:48.682
(man)
Who the hell do you
think you are, bitch?

00:48.716 --> 00:50.651
(woman)
I'm the bitch who's gonna
tell everyone what you did.

00:50.684 --> 00:51.852
How do you like that?!

00:51.885 --> 00:53.221
(man)
You think you can threaten me?!

00:53.254 --> 00:54.622
[woman screams, crashing]

00:54.655 --> 00:56.824
(woman)
Oh, my God, don't, please.
[gun cocks]

00:56.857 --> 00:58.659
Come on, don't do this.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.195
This isn't right.
Come on, please.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.397
You're nothing without me,
you whore!

01:03.431 --> 01:04.398
[crying]
Please, don't.

01:04.432 --> 01:05.633
Ohh!

01:05.666 --> 01:08.836
[gunshot, body falls]

01:08.869 --> 01:10.104
Downstairs neighbor
heard a knockdown,

01:10.138 --> 01:11.172
drag-out last night.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.573
Came up this morning
to complain,

01:12.606 --> 01:13.741
door was unlocked.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.744
This is what he found.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.713
Victim's name
is Monica Phelps.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.615
Looks like she's been
raped and shot.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.517
ME's in route.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.686
[phone ringing]

01:25.719 --> 01:27.755
Go ahead.

01:27.788 --> 01:30.724
Just say hello.
Let them do the talking.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.293
Hello.

01:33.761 --> 01:34.895
Uh...

01:34.928 --> 01:36.897
Hold on.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.533
Washington Middle School
says Nathan Phelps is absent,

01:39.567 --> 01:40.801
and do we know
he's not in school?

01:40.834 --> 01:42.370
You think
he's been kidnapped?

01:42.403 --> 01:43.537
Did you search
the apartment?

01:43.571 --> 01:45.873
First thing.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.441
How about the closet?

01:47.475 --> 01:49.310
No, didn't wanna
move the body.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.912
Bullet went
all the way through.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.114
Nathan,
are you in there?

01:56.784 --> 01:58.286
1, 2, 3...

02:01.822 --> 02:03.657
Nathan!

02:08.762 --> 02:10.664
Nathan, are you hurt?

02:10.698 --> 02:12.366
No.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.404
I'm Olivia.
This is Elliot.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.838
We're police officers.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.544
My mom...

02:23.577 --> 02:25.413
She's dead, isn't she?

02:27.748 --> 02:30.318
Yes, Nathan.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.852
I'm sorry.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.257
Come on.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.325
Come on.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.859
Come on.

02:43.231 --> 02:46.400
Don't look.
Don't look. Don't look.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.384
I don't wanna leave yet.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.886
I don't wanna leave her
all by herself.

03:38.919 --> 03:41.455
Okay, well, we'll wait
till they bring her down.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.756
And I'm not staying
in some foster care.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.492
I'm staying here.

03:44.525 --> 03:45.793
Nathan, let's talk
about that later.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.395
Right now, the doctor's
gonna check you out

03:47.428 --> 03:49.597
and make sure
that you're okay.

03:49.630 --> 03:50.898
I couldn't see the guy.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.466
I couldn't see
what he really looked like.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.335
(Stabler)
Nathan, you can't
worry about that now.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.303
They were yelling,

03:55.336 --> 03:57.538
and my mom said
she was gonna call the cops.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.939
(Stabler)
What were they fighting about?

03:58.972 --> 04:00.274
(Nathan)
She was trying to make him
leave.

04:00.308 --> 04:01.875
He started hitting her.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.477
(Benson)
Did your mom know that you were
hiding in the closet?

04:03.511 --> 04:04.845
(Nathan)
I go there when
she's got company.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.947
(Benson)
Did she have company a lot?

04:06.980 --> 04:08.416
(Nathan)
Yeah.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.518
(Stabler)
Where's your dad?

04:10.551 --> 04:13.053
Dead.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.888
S-s...

04:14.922 --> 04:16.657
stabbed when I was six.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.759
Nathan...

04:20.861 --> 04:23.431
Do you have any family
that we can contact?

04:23.464 --> 04:25.433
If they're close by,
we could arrange for you

04:25.466 --> 04:27.535
to stay with them.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.802
Can you find Aunt Gina?

04:28.836 --> 04:30.704
Is that your mom's sister?

04:30.738 --> 04:32.506
(Nathan)
No, I call her Aunt Gina

04:32.540 --> 04:34.074
because she was
my mom's best friend.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.944
She lived with us,
but then she left.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.413
(Stabler)
So what's Gina's last name?

04:39.447 --> 04:40.781
Arroyo.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.616
When did she leave?

04:42.650 --> 04:44.051
Three months ago, maybe.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.454
But...we thought
she got locked up.

04:46.487 --> 04:49.490
(Benson)
Do you know what for?

04:49.523 --> 04:50.758
Crystal meth.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.560
(Nathan)
That stuff is so bad.

04:52.593 --> 04:53.794
Makes people crazy.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.796
Was your mom
using it too?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.433
[sniffs]

05:10.878 --> 05:12.546
She kicked it before,

05:12.580 --> 05:15.616
and promised she was
gonna stop for good!

05:17.585 --> 05:19.453
Nathan...

05:19.487 --> 05:21.522
There was nothing
you could do.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.058
I used to get it for her

05:25.092 --> 05:27.027
when she was too sick
to get it herself.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.530
So you know where
your mom's dealer lives?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.665
Yeah...DJ.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.767
I hate that guy!

05:33.801 --> 05:36.904
We need to talk
to you, DJ!

05:36.937 --> 05:38.572
Look, man, I ain't
carryin', all right!

05:38.606 --> 05:39.973
And you can search me!

05:40.007 --> 05:42.443
Look what I found.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.877
(Fin)
That's worth a few grand.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.479
You can't pin that on me.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.881
Yeah, but I might be able
to pin a murder on you, DJ.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.417
A what?

05:49.450 --> 05:51.151
The rape and murder
of Monica Phelps.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.787
No, no, no, no.
I did not murder her!

05:53.821 --> 05:55.889
So what should I use--
Lemony Goodness

05:55.923 --> 05:57.625
or Mountain Stream?

05:57.658 --> 05:59.993
Tell us where
Gina Arroyo is.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.529
Look, man,
I don't know any Gina!

06:01.562 --> 06:04.665
And I'd be an idiot
to kill Monica.

06:04.698 --> 06:05.966
My best customer.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.535
So what's a hooker doing
with enough ice

06:07.568 --> 06:09.136
to open up
her own dealership?

06:09.169 --> 06:10.871
Guess she had
a heavy habit.

06:10.904 --> 06:13.073
Or maybe she was trying
to get in on your game.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.108
That chick was working
at a hot dog stand.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.611
She wouldn't be frying franks
if she was dealing.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.112
Now, wasn't I helpful?

06:19.146 --> 06:20.681
Very.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.623
(man)
I'm sorry Monica's dead,
but I gotta tell ya,

06:29.657 --> 06:31.058
I was gonna
fire her anyway.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.059
Why?

06:32.092 --> 06:33.060
She started
missing shifts,

06:33.093 --> 06:34.728
or she'd come in
so hopped up

06:34.762 --> 06:36.664
that I had to send her home.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.032
This is a very
demanding job.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.701
You gotta be sharp.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.736
Well, has Monica had
any trouble lately?

06:42.770 --> 06:43.637
Maybe with a boyfriend?

06:43.671 --> 06:44.738
Doubt it.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.607
All she cared about
was her next fix.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.775
Uh, did she have a locker?

06:47.808 --> 06:49.176
Yeah.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.745
Hey...could you
take her stuff?

06:51.779 --> 06:53.080
We need the space.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.687
Sweater, gum,
lip gloss.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.555
Not taking up
that much space.

07:01.589 --> 07:02.790
Something down there.

07:11.665 --> 07:14.535
We gotta get
in the hot dog business.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.636
(Cragen)
How much?

07:15.669 --> 07:16.937
15 grand.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.506
Stolen?
Not from work.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.708
Boss says he'd know if his
register was short 15 cents.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.009
Well, why work
at that hot dog joint

07:22.042 --> 07:23.644
if she had access
to all that cash?

07:23.677 --> 07:25.112
That wasn't living money.
That was partying money.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.214
And a hell of a lot
of tricks to turn while Nathan

07:27.247 --> 07:28.782
hid in the closet.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.651
Well, it had to come
from somewhere else then.

07:30.684 --> 07:31.652
Where's the son?

07:31.685 --> 07:32.720
(Cragen)
He's in the crib.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.221
He wants
to stay here tonight.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.223
I don't think spending
one night here

07:36.256 --> 07:37.591
could do any damage.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.794
If he feels safe,
then it might even help.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.164
Hey, there.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.966
[door closes]

07:45.999 --> 07:49.002
Sorry about the PJs.

07:49.036 --> 07:53.541
We'll go pick up your stuff
at the apartment tomorrow, okay?

07:53.574 --> 07:55.843
There's nothing there
I want.

07:58.579 --> 08:01.181
You're gonna send me
to a home tomorrow, aren't you?

08:03.584 --> 08:04.785
I know it.

08:04.818 --> 08:08.121
Nathan...I won't
send you anywhere

08:08.155 --> 08:10.123
until you're ready to go.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.898
Did you find Aunt Gina?

08:17.931 --> 08:19.600
We're still looking.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.068
But...

08:21.101 --> 08:22.770
I couldn't find
any records about

08:22.803 --> 08:24.838
her being arrested.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.807
But we did find
a lot of cash

08:26.840 --> 08:28.842
in your mom's locker
at work.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.978
You have any idea
how it got there?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.684
From the good people.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.019
They give you money
if you're poor.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.854
Is that a church?

08:40.888 --> 08:42.856
No, they just help you.

08:42.890 --> 08:48.195
They gave my mom money
to go to school, but...

08:48.228 --> 08:50.030
she never went.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.134
Well, do you know
where we could find them?

08:55.803 --> 08:57.838
They have a office somewhere.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.943
I just can't remember.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.880
It's okay, Nathan.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.983
It's okay.
You know what?

09:10.017 --> 09:13.621
It's late.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.889
Think you could sleep?

09:15.923 --> 09:17.124
Sure.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.862
You know, I could stay
if you want to.

09:21.895 --> 09:26.734
I know sometimes it's hard
to sleep in a strange place.

09:26.767 --> 09:28.836
No, you can go.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.340
Okay.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.844
Good night.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.849
Detective Benson...

09:41.882 --> 09:43.884
Yeah?

09:43.917 --> 09:47.855
One time, the good people
gave my mom money

09:47.888 --> 09:49.022
to get out of jail.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.027
I didn't wanna tell you
'cause...

09:54.061 --> 09:57.798
I just didn't.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.901
That's gonna be
very helpful, Nathan.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.770
Thank you.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.806
Good night.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.340
Detective Benson...

10:07.374 --> 10:08.942
Yes, David?

10:08.976 --> 10:11.712
You can stay if you want.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.081
I mean, for a little while.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.850
How about if I just stay
till you fall asleep?

10:18.819 --> 10:22.155
Yeah, that's good.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.224
Okay.

10:33.433 --> 10:36.369
(Stabler)
The court record says
you bailed out Monica Phelps.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.838
(woman)
Yes, I did bail Monica out.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.339
She'd been doing so well,

10:39.372 --> 10:41.341
but methamphetamine's
a tough habit to kick.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.010
What exactly is
your relationship to her?

10:43.043 --> 10:44.244
She was a client.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.312
And I considered her
a friend.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.379
A client of what?

10:46.413 --> 10:48.181
My Salvation Charities.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.083
We assist women in need.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.352
Single moms,
recent parolees.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.988
Women simply
down on their luck.

10:55.022 --> 10:57.324
Dolores Anderson

10:57.357 --> 10:58.458
and my husband
Ted Carthage,

10:58.491 --> 10:59.426
who runs the foundation.

10:59.459 --> 11:00.961
These are police.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.295
Monica Phelps
has been killed.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.198
(Dolores)
Oh, no.
(Ted)
Oh, my God.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.233
What about her son?

11:06.266 --> 11:07.134
(Benson)
He's safe.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.137
But he said that you
gave his mother money.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.472
I believe we paid
for her drug rehab

11:12.505 --> 11:14.441
and got her
an education grant.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.343
Well, she had $15,000
in a brown paper bag

11:16.376 --> 11:17.778
when she died.

11:17.811 --> 11:18.912
Did you give her cash?

11:18.946 --> 11:20.180
Well, that
wasn't from us.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.215
We'll occasionally provide
start-up funds,

11:22.249 --> 11:25.018
but, uh, we've never
given that much to one person.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.254
Well, we're looking
for associates

11:27.287 --> 11:28.455
that may have
known about the money.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.123
Do you know Gina Arroyo?

11:30.891 --> 11:32.159
I don't recognize the name.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.260
Are any of your clients
friends with Monica?

11:33.293 --> 11:36.063
Candace Tanner
may be able to help.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.765
She and Monica
were in rehab together.

11:37.798 --> 11:38.999
Yeah...

11:39.032 --> 11:41.902
I can't remember when
I saw Monica last.

11:41.935 --> 11:42.936
Sorry.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.071
(Benson)
Can you guess?

11:44.104 --> 11:46.039
Uh...not really.

11:46.073 --> 11:50.043
Well, Ted Carthage
from My Salvation said you--

11:50.077 --> 11:52.245
Said you could
help us out there, Candace.

11:52.279 --> 11:53.814
Oh, did he?
Yeah.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.383
Uh...okay, so...

11:56.416 --> 11:58.085
So maybe a month ago?

11:58.118 --> 11:59.920
Monica have
any boyfriends?

12:02.189 --> 12:04.157
Hey, why are you
in such a hurry there, huh?

12:04.191 --> 12:06.026
You got somewhere to go,
like to your drug dealer?

12:06.059 --> 12:07.094
Get off of me.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.395
Your friend
was murdered.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.529
You gonna do something
about it,

12:09.562 --> 12:11.198
or let the same thing
happen to you?

12:11.231 --> 12:12.332
I don't know, okay?!
God!

12:12.365 --> 12:14.134
She wasn't
even my friend!

12:14.167 --> 12:15.168
[cell phone rings]

12:15.202 --> 12:16.269
Lying.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.071
Question is, for who?

12:18.105 --> 12:20.073
Benson.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.409
Finally some good news!

12:22.442 --> 12:24.144
Great, we'll be there.

12:24.177 --> 12:27.014
Ballistics matched
the slugs from Monica

12:27.047 --> 12:29.182
to one of the Jane Does
in the morgue.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.358
(Stabler)
Aunt Gina.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.793
Body was found
three months ago

12:39.827 --> 12:41.194
dumped in Riverside Park.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.196
Two shots, point blank,
to the chest.

12:43.230 --> 12:46.033
Never found an ID,
no missing persons report.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.168
And now Nathan
has someone else to mourn.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.448
Yeah...that's Aunt Gina.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.384
I'm very sorry, Nathan.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.854
Nathan...

13:06.887 --> 13:08.922
We think the same man
who killed your mom

13:08.956 --> 13:10.057
killed Gina too.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.324
Can you think of anybody

13:11.358 --> 13:13.260
that both Gina and your mom
would have known?

13:13.293 --> 13:14.361
No.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.365
Where am I gonna go now?

13:21.568 --> 13:23.403
Well, uh...

13:23.436 --> 13:25.572
Do you wanna go back
to the station?

13:27.875 --> 13:29.542
Well, then, that's
where we're gonna go.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.544
Come on.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.482
Her personal effects.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.617
Clothing, jewelry,
plastic bag.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.053
And a voucher for what was
in the plastic bag.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.054
And what's that?

13:41.088 --> 13:43.123
$7,000 cash.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.861
Where the hell's
all this money coming from?

13:47.895 --> 13:49.829
Check out
the rubber bracelet.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.401
Psalm 38:22.

13:54.434 --> 13:55.435
Beats me.

13:55.468 --> 13:59.106
"Make haste to help me,
O Lord, my salvation."

13:59.139 --> 14:02.609
"My salvation"?

14:02.642 --> 14:05.245
Thought they
didn't know Gina.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.914
Look how many people
we serve.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.082
It's impossible to keep track
of everyone.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.117
You don't keep records?

14:10.150 --> 14:11.118
We do.
Break 'em out.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.219
Why?

14:12.252 --> 14:13.987
Because two people
you helped are dead.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.655
And they both had
a lot of cash on them.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.290
Money train starts here.

14:17.324 --> 14:20.393
I told you, we don't
give out large sums.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.095
So maybe they stole them.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.630
Show us your
financial records.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.233
So that's what
this is about.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.135
What?

14:28.168 --> 14:30.337
Our records are private.
You have no legal right to them.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.072
And I am disgusted
by this witch hunt.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.107
What are you
talking about?

14:34.141 --> 14:36.176
Ted has dedicated his life
to helping people

14:36.209 --> 14:37.444
others would consider trash.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.247
Addicts, whores,
and degenerates.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.282
And he gets nothing
in return!

14:42.315 --> 14:45.185
Tell that
to whomever sent you.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.120
So she's got
nothing to hide.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.189
Nooo, not at all.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.159
Let's subpoena her anyway.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.426
Don't need to.
I checked the dockets.

14:53.460 --> 14:54.661
Ted Carthage
is being investigated

14:54.694 --> 14:56.296
by the state
attorney general.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.398
I subpoenaed his office
for the records instead.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.599
It's a lot less trouble.

14:59.632 --> 15:00.600
Investigated for what?

15:00.633 --> 15:01.701
Embezzlement and fraud.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.835
From the charity?

15:02.869 --> 15:04.671
No, Carthage funds every dollar
of the charity himself.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.506
His business interests
are being investigated.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.976
Real estate investments,
construction companies,

15:09.009 --> 15:10.077
finance firms.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.478
(Benson)
Must be worth millions.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.446
Actually, it may
be worth nothing.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.148
His partners believe
he's been shifting money

15:15.182 --> 15:16.583
between the charity
and the businesses.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.318
Trying to hide the fact
the money's going out.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.120
But nothing's
coming in.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.221
Well, we got a couple
of dead women

15:21.254 --> 15:22.422
who came into
a lot of money.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.992
He wrote checks to
a lot of live ones too.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.362
(Munch)
I don't get it, Vivien.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.264
Why Ted Carthage
give you $14,000

15:31.298 --> 15:32.632
in 11 months?

15:32.665 --> 15:33.733
It was a loan.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.202
He wrote you
eight checks.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.369
They were all loans.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.470
For what?

15:37.504 --> 15:38.638
Personal expenses.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.140
Yeah, I can see that.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.708
Nice crank bugs
on your face.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.076
You're a pig.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.511
You ever pay
those loans back?

15:44.544 --> 15:46.546
Don't forget, we can check
your financial records.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.748
I mean it was a present.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.550
Excuse me.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.121
Katie, we know you cashed
a check for $2,000.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.522
We have your signature.

15:55.555 --> 15:56.689
No, I didn't.

15:56.723 --> 15:57.524
You're not in trouble.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.160
We're investigating
Ted Carthage.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.363
It's really gross.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.065
Does it have to do
with drugs?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.368
Katie...

16:11.704 --> 16:14.141
Are you using crystal meth?

16:15.708 --> 16:17.744
It's--it's not like
I'm shooting it.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.512
You're gonna
kill yourself.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.314
I know.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.283
I know.
I'll stop, okay?

16:23.316 --> 16:26.319
Did Carthage give you
the money to buy the drugs?

16:27.420 --> 16:29.256
He gave it to me because...

16:30.790 --> 16:32.225
I did him.

16:32.259 --> 16:33.793
Had sex with him?

16:33.826 --> 16:40.633
It was...
only supposed to be...oral.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.503
But he got all pushy.

16:43.536 --> 16:46.539
I just looked away and pretended
I was somewhere else.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.042
Katie...

16:49.076 --> 16:50.743
What you're describing
is rape.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.246
No...he paid me.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.681
The law says
that doesn't matter.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.450
You're under the age
of consent.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.753
Candace said he wouldn't
want to go all the way.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.289
Liar.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.390
Candace Tanner?

17:03.423 --> 17:04.424
Uh-huh.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.193
What does she have
to do with this?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.295
She hooks us up--
gets the motel rooms and stuff.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.830
Ted pays, like,
thousands of dollars.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.765
But the bitch
took most of mine.

17:12.799 --> 17:16.103
I only made 500 bucks!

17:16.136 --> 17:18.705
Oh, Candy, you messed up...
real bad.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.274
(Benson)
Promoting prostitution's
already hitting the big time.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.343
But promoting sex
with a minor?

17:23.376 --> 17:24.711
All you can prove
is Ted Carthage

17:24.744 --> 17:26.779
paid girls to have sex
with him.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.381
You have
nothing on my client

17:28.415 --> 17:30.317
other than the words
of junkies.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.718
You're pretty smart.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.121
Taking a cut from
every girl's payday in cash,

17:34.154 --> 17:35.788
so there's no money trail
from Carthage to you.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.524
See, we have a witness

17:37.557 --> 17:39.659
who'd like nothing better
than to screw you

17:39.692 --> 17:41.394
for the 1,500 bucks
you owe her.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.463
(lawyer)
Witness?
Or willing participant?

17:43.496 --> 17:46.799
How much money did you make
selling those other girls?

17:46.833 --> 17:48.168
You get sick of
selling yourself, Candy?

17:48.201 --> 17:49.202
Shut up.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.404
And how do you think
Ted Carthage is gonna react

17:51.438 --> 17:52.672
when we arrest him?

17:52.705 --> 17:54.307
You think he's gonna
go down without a fight?

17:54.341 --> 17:56.576
Or you think he's gonna
shove all the blame on you?

17:56.609 --> 17:58.678
So you got all this evidence.
What do you need me for?

17:58.711 --> 18:00.880
Well, your attorney's
not altogether wrong.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.649
The testimony
of crank addicts

18:02.682 --> 18:04.284
against the word
of Mr. Philanthropist?

18:04.317 --> 18:06.453
That's only gonna
take us so far.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.388
You're gonna take us
the rest of the way.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.823
Hey...

18:10.857 --> 18:12.659
It's Candace.

18:12.692 --> 18:13.826
(Carthage)
Good to hear from you.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.795
How'd it go
with the police?

18:15.828 --> 18:17.430
(Candace)
No problem.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.299
I got an appointment
for you.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.901
Repeat customer.
You'll like it.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.803
(Carthage)
Hmm, great.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.813
What a nice surprise.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.683
What's your name again?

18:36.716 --> 18:37.917
Katie.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.587
Of course.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.921
You know
that's my favorite name.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.156
Yeah.

18:43.190 --> 18:45.158
You said that before.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.163
So...

18:51.531 --> 18:55.568
What do you...wanna do?

18:57.937 --> 18:59.639
Well, I, uh...

18:59.672 --> 19:01.874
I like what you're wearing.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.776
Thanks.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.812
Would you like
something to drink?

19:05.845 --> 19:07.680
No.

19:09.616 --> 19:12.452
Do you have, like,
a fantasy...

19:12.485 --> 19:15.588
or...whatever...

19:15.622 --> 19:19.892
that you wanna try out?

19:19.926 --> 19:24.797
You are just wonderful.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.875
I'm so pleased, Katie.

19:35.908 --> 19:41.180
This is...quite a change
from our last encounter.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.788
Why don't you, uh,
just take your clothes off

19:48.821 --> 19:52.792
and...we'll have ourselves
a good time.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.529
Can I have
a good time too?

19:56.563 --> 19:57.597
Me too.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.998
I bet we can all
have a lot of fun.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.234
Come on, Katie.
You did great.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.769
Teddy, you're
under arrest.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.604
You have the right
to remain silent.

20:04.637 --> 20:05.672
You give up that right,
anything you say

20:05.705 --> 20:07.974
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.376
You have the right
to an attorney.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.777
If you can't afford one,

20:10.810 --> 20:11.944
one will be
appointed for you.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.416
I'm confused, detectives.

20:16.449 --> 20:17.850
You claim my client
was attempting

20:17.884 --> 20:19.319
to have sex with a minor.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.654
And you know this because
you can read his mind?

20:21.688 --> 20:23.490
No, we know this
because he paid the minor

20:23.523 --> 20:25.325
$2,000 to have sex.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.626
(Carthage)
That's not true.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.529
He paid Janie Myer $4,000.

20:29.562 --> 20:32.465
Alisha Jackson got $6,500.

20:32.499 --> 20:37.304
Lori Reeves,
payment totaling $123,000.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.038
Lori must have
some special talents, huh?

20:39.071 --> 20:40.106
You're intentionally
spinning this.

20:40.139 --> 20:42.875
He's a philanthropist
giving indigent people money.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.744
(Stabler)
Do you know how much
you've spent on them, Ted?

20:44.777 --> 20:46.413
Have you done the math?

20:46.446 --> 20:47.880
Hmm?

20:47.914 --> 20:49.916
$2 million.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.785
Huh?
$2 million worth of sex?

20:52.819 --> 20:54.287
Hundreds of women?

20:54.321 --> 20:56.389
I never paid anyone
for sex.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.326
Did you use protection
every time, Mr. Carthage?

20:59.359 --> 21:02.462
Because many of those women
are IV drug users.

21:02.495 --> 21:04.797
Have you been tested
for Hep C, HIV?

21:04.831 --> 21:07.767
Has your wife?
'Cause we could ask her.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.436
I'm sorry, you're right.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.470
That's enough, Ted.

21:10.503 --> 21:13.640
No, no,
I need to say this.

21:13.673 --> 21:17.944
I've...been unfaithful.
Many times.

21:17.977 --> 21:21.481
But I never paid anyone
for sex.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.715
They were my girlfriends.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.417
[Stabler laughs]

21:24.451 --> 21:26.419
Wow.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.921
You're a busy guy, huh?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.457
So all of
the financial transactions

21:30.490 --> 21:33.360
that happened after the sex
were completely unrelated.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.427
I wanted to help them.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.828
I loved them!

21:35.862 --> 21:36.863
Obviously these are women

21:36.896 --> 21:38.731
who saw a weak man

21:38.765 --> 21:41.401
and used his innate
generosity against him.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.802
You know,
I bet that's true.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.537
So you're a victim,
Teddy, huh?

21:44.571 --> 21:47.006
Maybe I'm a sex addict.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.508
Yeah, but that's not
your only problem.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.343
Were they
your girlfriends too?

21:50.377 --> 21:52.345
'Cause they're both
in your financial records.

21:52.379 --> 21:53.680
Gina made six grand off you.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.014
Monica nearly 30.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.349
We're done.
You were used?!

21:56.383 --> 21:57.850
You used these women's
drug addictions

21:57.884 --> 21:59.352
to turn
them into prostitutes!

21:59.386 --> 22:00.987
Monica Phelps threatened
to expose you,

22:01.020 --> 22:02.355
so you killed her.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.490
Gina do the same thing?

22:03.523 --> 22:05.124
She was gonna destroy
everything you'd created?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.760
This B.S. humanitarian
facade of yours?

22:07.794 --> 22:09.829
(lawyer)
No, not another word, Ted.

22:11.464 --> 22:14.434
You don't have proof
he murdered anyone.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.536
How about a witness?

22:18.905 --> 22:20.573
(Novak)
Number one.

22:22.575 --> 22:26.546
You're nothing without me,
you whore.

22:26.579 --> 22:27.880
Number two.

22:29.582 --> 22:33.386
You're nothing without me,
you whore.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.987
Three.

22:35.021 --> 22:38.124
(man)
You're nothing without me,
you whore.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.258
Four.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.494
(man)
You're nothing
without me, you whore.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.430
Number five.

22:43.463 --> 22:46.866
(man)
You're nothing
without me, you whore.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.001
Nathan,
do any of those voices

22:49.035 --> 22:51.037
sound like the man
from your apartment?

22:52.939 --> 22:55.041
I'd pick
number two or five.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.109
And we have our answer.
Shut up.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.511
You can only
choose one.

22:58.545 --> 22:59.912
So would you like
to hear them again?

22:59.946 --> 23:02.849
I--I can get it.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.016
Number five, am I right?

23:04.050 --> 23:06.553
I need to get
my client arraigned

23:06.586 --> 23:07.920
so he's home by dinner.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.589
[door opens]

23:09.622 --> 23:11.924
Number two?
I can do it again.

23:11.958 --> 23:15.428
It's okay.
You did very well.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.466
Can I do it over?

23:19.499 --> 23:21.734
No, honey, we're gonna
get the guy some other way.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.002
But you know what?

23:23.035 --> 23:24.671
There's an Italian restaurant
across the street.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.873
Come on.
I'll buy you lunch.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.043
I heard that lawyer.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.513
He's gonna get out
by dinner.

23:33.546 --> 23:35.047
Not if I can help it.

23:35.081 --> 23:39.619
Nathan, I am gonna do
everything I can

23:39.652 --> 23:42.088
to put the man that killed
your mother in jail.

23:43.956 --> 23:46.493
Come on.
Eat something.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.802
I know that guy.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.537
That's one of
the good people.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.639
Number two!

23:59.672 --> 24:01.474
Nathan! No!

24:01.508 --> 24:02.509
Nathan, no!

24:03.743 --> 24:05.478
Nathan!
Nathan!

24:05.512 --> 24:06.546
[horn honking]

24:06.579 --> 24:08.581
Nathan,
get out of the street!

24:08.615 --> 24:09.816
[honk]

24:09.849 --> 24:10.817
(Nathan)
Stop! Stop!

24:10.850 --> 24:12.051
Stop!

24:12.084 --> 24:14.120
Nathan!

24:14.153 --> 24:16.122
Stop!
He killed my mom!

24:16.155 --> 24:17.557
He killed my mom!

24:17.590 --> 24:18.558
Nathan!

24:18.591 --> 24:20.493
Nathan! Nathan!

24:23.062 --> 24:24.230
It's okay.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.601
It's okay.

24:28.635 --> 24:30.637
He recognized Carthage.

24:30.670 --> 24:31.538
Because he's
seen him before.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.005
Yeah,
killing his mother.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.507
He never saw his mother's
killer--you know that, Liv.

24:34.541 --> 24:35.942
(Benson)
Seeing him triggered
his memory.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.044
Or he figured it out when he saw
Carthage in handcuffs

24:38.077 --> 24:39.746
with the same attorney
from the line-up.

24:39.779 --> 24:40.747
Look,
it doesn't matter.

24:40.780 --> 24:41.914
Nathan picked
the wrong voice,

24:41.948 --> 24:43.550
so any ID he makes now
is tainted.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.984
Can't we let
a jury decide that?

24:45.017 --> 24:47.587
No judge would ever
let this go before a jury.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.255
We can try and keep
Carthage off the street

24:49.288 --> 24:51.691
for statutory rape until
we can make the murder case.

24:51.724 --> 24:52.859
Might not have to.

24:52.892 --> 24:55.528
Shots fired
at My Salvation Charities.

24:55.562 --> 24:56.996
Where's Nathan?

24:57.029 --> 24:59.131
He's in the crib.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.972
Black male youth
entered the premises

25:06.005 --> 25:07.674
approximately
50 minutes ago.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.108
Demanded to see
the guy in charge.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.543
The victim
approached the subject,

25:10.577 --> 25:12.645
who immediately shot him
twice in the chest.

25:12.679 --> 25:13.646
Who else is inside?

25:13.680 --> 25:14.747
Just the shooter
and the victim.

25:14.781 --> 25:16.015
Kid let everybody else go.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.685
Please help my husband!
He needs an ambulance!

25:18.718 --> 25:20.252
Victim still alive?

25:20.286 --> 25:22.622
We've been calling for him.
No answer.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.692
Any contact
from the shooter?

25:25.725 --> 25:27.794
Not a word.
We're prepared to go in.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.297
Let me go.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.533
Only if you're
armed and protected.

25:38.905 --> 25:41.608
Nathan?

25:41.641 --> 25:44.243
It's Detective Benson.
I'm coming in.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.347
Nathan?

25:48.380 --> 25:50.717
Tell me where you are.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.727
[Nathan sobs]

26:03.663 --> 26:06.265
[Nathan crying softly]

26:16.709 --> 26:17.944
Nathan.

26:17.977 --> 26:21.848
I need you to put that gun
down on the floor now.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.652
I didn't know
what else to do.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.119
He was alive,
and my mom was dead!

26:27.153 --> 26:28.821
Nathan, I know.

26:28.855 --> 26:31.123
I understand that.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.626
But now I need you
to listen.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.194
Okay?

26:35.227 --> 26:38.965
You have
to give me that gun.

26:38.998 --> 26:42.902
Nathan, I don't want anything
bad to happen to you.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.304
He shot her!

26:45.337 --> 26:47.740
I messed up,
and I had to fix it!

26:47.774 --> 26:49.208
Give me that gun.

26:49.241 --> 26:50.910
[gun rattles to floor]

26:53.880 --> 26:56.716
She tried to give me
to a social worker.

26:59.018 --> 27:02.655
Your mother?

27:02.689 --> 27:04.924
I don't even care anymore.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.198
I do.

27:12.231 --> 27:14.834
Nathan...

27:14.867 --> 27:18.705
Your mom
was really sick.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.373
I would be lucky
to have a son like you.

27:23.776 --> 27:25.778
Anybody would.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.219
[sniffles]

27:35.722 --> 27:37.990
Where did you get the gun?

27:38.024 --> 27:40.793
A kid down the hall
in my building.

27:40.827 --> 27:44.296
It was his dad's.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.199
(Novak)
How did you find
Mr. Carthage's office?

27:47.233 --> 27:50.169
411.

27:50.202 --> 27:51.738
I think you can see

27:51.771 --> 27:53.906
that we're trying
to cooperate here.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.308
And I would hope that
in return that the People

27:56.342 --> 27:57.710
would take
into consideration

27:57.744 --> 27:59.779
the extenuating
circumstances.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.714
We can't, Sophie.

28:01.748 --> 28:04.150
Yes, you can.
You're choosing not to.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.986
Your detectives found the gun
in Ted Carthage's desk.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.856
Ted Carthage
murdered his mother.

28:09.889 --> 28:13.459
My client really should
be tried as a juvenile.

28:13.492 --> 28:15.828
The DA will only allow him
to be tried as an adult.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.029
And I don't have a choice.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.497
Nathan...

28:18.530 --> 28:21.734
I told you
that we'd get him.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.770
Why didn't you
listen to me?

28:23.803 --> 28:26.806
I'm sorry.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.941
Casey, can't you show
a little mercy here?

28:28.975 --> 28:30.509
Considering everything
he's been through.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.780
Man Two, he serves
in a juvenile facility.

28:33.813 --> 28:37.416
I'm not enjoying this,
but mercy isn't enough.

28:37.449 --> 28:40.987
I'll plead this out
if you give me a reason to.

28:43.823 --> 28:46.158
Some of you might think
that Nathan Phelps

28:46.192 --> 28:48.127
acted
out of simple vengeance.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.862
Ted Carthage
murdered his mother,

28:49.896 --> 28:51.998
so he murdered Ted Carthage.

28:52.031 --> 28:54.901
That is what
the assistant district attorney

28:54.934 --> 28:55.902
will argue.

28:55.935 --> 28:56.936
She will tell you

28:56.969 --> 28:58.771
that anyone who kills

28:58.805 --> 29:00.372
out of retaliation

29:00.406 --> 29:03.309
should go to jail.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.344
I agree with her.

29:05.377 --> 29:08.414
But that is not
what my client did.

29:08.447 --> 29:11.818
Did he hate Ted Carthage?
Absolutely.

29:11.851 --> 29:14.987
Did he kill him?
Yes.

29:15.021 --> 29:17.223
So if not
out of retaliation,

29:17.256 --> 29:21.327
what made Nathan do it?

29:21.360 --> 29:25.231
This is a new study
published in Science magazine.

29:25.264 --> 29:29.869
It found that people who have
witnessed gun violence

29:29.902 --> 29:31.303
are twice as likely,

29:31.337 --> 29:33.873
sometimes three times
as likely,

29:33.906 --> 29:36.976
to commit an act of violence
themselves.

29:37.009 --> 29:41.247
Nathan witnessed Ted Carthage
shoot his mother.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.851
And just
as the study predicts,

29:44.884 --> 29:49.388
he reacted with violence.

29:49.421 --> 29:53.826
This study equates
gun violence

29:53.860 --> 29:55.995
with an infectious disease.

29:56.028 --> 30:00.032
Anyone exposed to it
is infected.

30:00.066 --> 30:04.003
Now, you may not agree
or like this study.

30:04.036 --> 30:06.405
Gun manufacturers
don't like it either.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.875
It goes against
their mantra:

30:08.908 --> 30:11.143
"Guns don't kill people.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.145
People kill people."

30:13.179 --> 30:16.883
But this study
points to something

30:16.916 --> 30:21.387
that is almost unspeakable
in today's gun culture.

30:21.420 --> 30:26.125
And that is that the blame
for violence

30:26.158 --> 30:32.164
can be directly placed
on the gun.

30:32.198 --> 30:34.967
Once you see someone
squeeze the trigger,

30:35.001 --> 30:38.938
it's easier
to do it yourself.

30:38.971 --> 30:42.408
Nathan saw his mother
shot to death

30:42.441 --> 30:44.043
in front of him,

30:44.076 --> 30:46.145
and at that moment

30:46.178 --> 30:49.882
he contracted the disease.

30:49.916 --> 30:54.586
It wasn't his choice,
any more that it is your choice

30:54.620 --> 30:56.255
to catch a cold

30:56.288 --> 31:00.993
after someone
has sneezed on you.

31:01.027 --> 31:04.396
Violence is the disease.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.999
Guns are the virus.

31:08.667 --> 31:12.371
And we have an epidemic
on our hands.

31:15.007 --> 31:18.077
(judge)
Ms. Novak, your first witness.

31:18.110 --> 31:21.247
The people call
Detective Olivia Benson.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.015
At any point
did Nathan Phelps

31:23.049 --> 31:25.284
admit he shot and killed
Ted Carthage?

31:25.317 --> 31:27.586
At the crime scene
and during the questioning.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.121
Did he say why?

31:29.155 --> 31:30.957
(Benson)
Nathan said
that it was his fault

31:30.990 --> 31:31.924
that Mr. Carthage
hadn't been charged

31:31.958 --> 31:33.059
with his mother's murder.

31:33.092 --> 31:36.095
He said that
he had to do something.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.930
Did Nathan
blame his actions

31:37.964 --> 31:39.098
on seeing
his mother get shot?

31:39.131 --> 31:41.233
Objection.
Leading the witness.

31:41.267 --> 31:42.935
Sustained.

31:42.969 --> 31:44.336
No further questions.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.138
Detective...

31:47.573 --> 31:50.142
You found Nathan
in that closet.

31:50.176 --> 31:51.343
Yes.

31:51.377 --> 31:53.012
What was
his emotional state?

31:53.045 --> 31:54.713
He was traumatized.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.515
In the course
of your investigation,

31:56.548 --> 31:58.951
did you find any evidence
of violent behavior

31:58.985 --> 32:00.219
in Nathan's past?

32:00.252 --> 32:01.287
No.

32:01.320 --> 32:02.521
Any emotional instability?

32:02.554 --> 32:03.990
No.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.591
You had lots of opportunity

32:05.624 --> 32:07.693
to observe
Nathan's behavior.

32:07.726 --> 32:09.328
You let him sleep
in the precinct.

32:09.361 --> 32:10.696
You took him out to eat.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.664
You got close.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.133
Your Honor,
is there a question?

32:14.166 --> 32:15.234
Yes, there is.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.236
In your opinion,
Detective,

32:17.269 --> 32:21.307
would Nathan ever have
done anything to harm anyone

32:21.340 --> 32:24.010
had he not witnessed
his mother's shooting?

32:24.043 --> 32:25.544
Objection...leading.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.046
(judge)
Sustained.

32:27.079 --> 32:29.415
No.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.716
I don't think
that he would've.

32:30.749 --> 32:33.019
Objection, Your Honor.
Move to strike.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.386
(judge)
Sustained.

32:34.420 --> 32:37.089
The jury will disregard
the witness' statement.

32:37.123 --> 32:40.059
No further questions.

32:40.092 --> 32:41.760
Detective Benson...

32:41.793 --> 32:45.697
Does witnessing a murder
justify committing a murder?

32:45.731 --> 32:47.099
It doesn't justify it.

32:47.133 --> 32:48.600
But it might explain it.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.743
Casey...

32:57.776 --> 32:59.278
You here
to ambush me again?

32:59.311 --> 33:01.047
I'm here to apologize.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.448
You gave the jury
a reason to acquit.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.150
I was trying
to tell the truth.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.551
I'm sorry.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.686
What are you gonna do?

33:07.719 --> 33:10.356
Draft a plea bargain.

33:10.389 --> 33:12.191
I damaged your case
that much?

33:12.224 --> 33:14.360
You changed my mind.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.663
And I'll bet you convinced
a juror or two.

33:23.169 --> 33:25.104
(Novak)
Your Honor, the parties
have reached a plea bargain

33:25.137 --> 33:26.072
in this case.

33:26.105 --> 33:27.239
(Devere)
The defendant
will plead guilty

33:27.273 --> 33:29.375
to one count of manslaughter
in the second degree.

33:29.408 --> 33:30.676
I beg your pardon,
Your Honor.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.178
Mike Geddes, representing
the Carthage family.

33:32.211 --> 33:33.612
I'd like to be heard
in this matter.

33:33.645 --> 33:34.680
(Novak)
The Carthage family

33:34.713 --> 33:36.115
has no standing on this case.

33:36.148 --> 33:38.050
[chuckles]
Well, I've got a court order

33:38.084 --> 33:39.551
from Judge Joseph Malloy
stating otherwise.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.521
Well, counselors, I am afraid
we are unable to continue.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.790
I've just been handed
a restraining order

33:44.823 --> 33:47.393
enjoining me from accepting
the defendant's plea bargain

33:47.426 --> 33:50.396
and summoning us all
to appear in civil court.

33:50.429 --> 33:52.398
See you in the morning.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.740
Ted Carthage's wife
can stop your plea bargain?

34:01.773 --> 34:03.809
No, but she can mess up
our lives for a couple of weeks.

34:03.842 --> 34:05.311
How?

34:05.344 --> 34:06.512
Well, Donnelly can't
take Nathan's plea

34:06.545 --> 34:09.148
until a civil court judge
decides whether Mrs. Carthage

34:09.181 --> 34:10.182
can block it.

34:10.216 --> 34:11.383
[chuckles]
The lawyer's slick.

34:11.417 --> 34:12.451
Ah, you'll beat him.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.686
Well, Geddes cannot keep us
from filing forever.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.122
Don't get cocky yet.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.656
You haven't heard
who's paying his salary.

34:17.689 --> 34:18.824
Terri Carthage?

34:18.857 --> 34:21.760
Try the National
Gun Association.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.795
Why would the NGA get involved
in a murder trial?

34:23.829 --> 34:26.532
Devere said it
in her opening statement.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.100
The gun manufacturers,

34:28.134 --> 34:29.301
they're afraid
of the violence study

34:29.335 --> 34:30.369
because they might
be held accountable

34:30.402 --> 34:31.437
for children
committing murders.

34:31.470 --> 34:34.306
Once the DA's office
bases a plea on this study,

34:34.340 --> 34:35.474
it legitimizes the research.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.676
People believe that gun violence
breeds more violence...

34:37.709 --> 34:39.678
Good-bye Second Amendment.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.513
We got bigger problems
than the right to bear arms

34:41.547 --> 34:43.315
if the NGA successfully
stops this plea.

34:43.349 --> 34:44.883
What's bigger than
challenging the Constitution?

34:44.916 --> 34:47.853
You enjoy having a fully
functioning judicial system?

34:47.886 --> 34:50.122
Do you find it useful
to put criminals in jail?

34:50.156 --> 34:51.423
Because if this happens,

34:51.457 --> 34:52.724
you can kiss it
all good-bye.

34:52.758 --> 34:53.792
Come on.

34:53.825 --> 34:55.394
If the NGA
can stop a plea,

34:55.427 --> 34:56.595
then any
individual corporation

34:56.628 --> 34:59.298
or special interest group with
the money and the inclination

34:59.331 --> 35:00.599
can do the same.

35:00.632 --> 35:01.467
And if prosecutors

35:01.500 --> 35:03.402
lose the ability
to make plea bargains,

35:03.435 --> 35:04.770
the legal system
comes to a grinding halt.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.805
So what do we do?

35:06.838 --> 35:08.507
You mean what do you do.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.442
Your office has
the most to lose here.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.644
You need to take
the lead on this.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.580
Get your arguments ready.

35:17.416 --> 35:18.617
Your Honor,
the district attorney

35:18.650 --> 35:20.419
has the right to enter
into plea agreements

35:20.452 --> 35:22.254
without input
from the victim's family.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.522
Which is why Congress
is considering

35:23.555 --> 35:24.790
amending the Constitution

35:24.823 --> 35:26.725
to enact the Crime Victim's
Bill of Rights.

35:26.758 --> 35:29.161
Victims' families should
have standing in plea bargains.

35:29.195 --> 35:30.696
Mr. Geddes isn't concerned
with the rights of victims

35:30.729 --> 35:32.331
or their families.

35:32.364 --> 35:34.533
He's using this case to further
his employer's agenda.

35:34.566 --> 35:36.268
The NGA's interests and
the Carthage family's interests

35:36.302 --> 35:37.303
are one and the same.

35:37.336 --> 35:38.737
A bogus study
is being used

35:38.770 --> 35:40.739
to cut a murderer a deal,
and many of us--

35:40.772 --> 35:43.342
yes, including the NGA--

35:43.375 --> 35:44.376
take issue with that.

35:44.410 --> 35:45.477
Well,
the NGA takes issue

35:45.511 --> 35:46.845
with every study about guns.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.647
These are the same people
that got Congress to kill

35:48.680 --> 35:50.749
a multimillion-dollar
firearms research budget.

35:50.782 --> 35:52.251
We're here to talk
about this study,

35:52.284 --> 35:53.619
which may be biased,
inapplicable,

35:53.652 --> 35:54.486
maybe flat-out wrong.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.188
But we don't know,
because it hasn't been

35:56.222 --> 35:57.523
fully vetted
by the courts.

35:57.556 --> 35:59.425
Then let's do that.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.827
I'm ordering
an evidentiary hearing.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.863
You have someone that can
explain more about this study?

36:04.896 --> 36:06.865
Yes, he's an expert
on juvenile violence.

36:06.898 --> 36:08.634
Get your
codefendants together

36:08.667 --> 36:11.637
and let's hear
what he's got to say.

36:14.940 --> 36:16.542
The authors of the study

36:16.575 --> 36:17.843
interviewed
over 1,500 children

36:17.876 --> 36:19.778
in the Chicago area.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.780
They also interviewed
caretakers,

36:21.813 --> 36:23.515
and collected data
on families.

36:23.549 --> 36:26.618
School performance,
economic standing.

36:26.652 --> 36:28.520
Over 150 factors in all.

36:28.554 --> 36:30.589
How many times were
the subjects interviewed?

36:30.622 --> 36:32.924
Three times
over five years.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.726
The goal was to determine
which of them

36:34.760 --> 36:37.529
had witnessed or been victims
of gun violence,

36:37.563 --> 36:40.232
and how they differed
from those subjects who had not.

36:40.266 --> 36:41.900
What were the findings?

36:41.933 --> 36:44.803
Those subjects that had
seen gun violence

36:44.836 --> 36:47.373
were at least twice as likely
to commit a violent act

36:47.406 --> 36:48.607
in the future.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.642
It's more predictive
than poverty,

36:50.676 --> 36:53.845
drug use, or being raised
by a single parent.

36:53.879 --> 36:56.248
So what does this mean?

36:56.282 --> 36:59.318
We need to look
at gun violence in a new way.

36:59.351 --> 37:03.355
It isn't a societal problem
or a class problem.

37:03.389 --> 37:05.023
It's a medical problem.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.693
We need to treat it like
it's an infectious disease.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.729
Policy makers can stop
the spread of this disease

37:10.762 --> 37:11.630
by limiting

37:11.663 --> 37:12.964
exposure to gun violence

37:12.998 --> 37:16.302
and treating those who have
been exposed early on.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.003
Thank you, Doctor.

37:19.871 --> 37:21.640
Do you believe
there's a causal link

37:21.673 --> 37:23.442
between witnessing
gun violence

37:23.475 --> 37:25.711
and becoming violent,
as your study claims?

37:25.744 --> 37:26.912
Yes.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.947
Even though many people
witness gun violence

37:28.980 --> 37:30.849
and do not
become violent.

37:30.882 --> 37:32.951
You've been exposed
to many viruses in your life

37:32.984 --> 37:34.386
without getting sick.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.690
I thought the way
to prove cause and effect

37:38.724 --> 37:41.760
was through
a controlled experiment.

37:41.793 --> 37:44.696
But this study was only
a statistical analysis, right?

37:44.730 --> 37:46.898
A controlled experiment
would require

37:46.932 --> 37:50.402
deliberately exposing
children to gun violence.

37:50.436 --> 37:52.037
Which, of course,
is unethical.

37:52.070 --> 37:55.607
So they use
the second best method...

37:55.641 --> 37:59.010
thereby obtaining
the second best results.

38:01.347 --> 38:02.981
Perfect.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.350
Nothing further.

38:04.383 --> 38:07.386
You're excused,
Dr. Young.

38:07.419 --> 38:08.554
Your Honor...

38:08.587 --> 38:11.423
I'd like to request
that Nathan Phelps

38:11.457 --> 38:12.458
be called to testify.

38:12.491 --> 38:13.925
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.562
This hearing is to examine
a scientific study.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.897
Any testimony from Nathan Phelps
is immaterial.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.799
I disagree.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.501
Whether or not we believe
the study to be valid,

38:22.534 --> 38:23.702
shouldn't we determine
at least if the boy

38:23.735 --> 38:25.671
fits the criteria
the study set forth?

38:25.704 --> 38:27.606
What exactly did Nathan see,
what are his motives?

38:27.639 --> 38:28.674
Only he can answer that.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.576
Your Honor,
the Fifth Amendment

38:30.609 --> 38:32.010
prohibits this court...
Ask for a recess.

38:32.043 --> 38:33.779
from compelling my client
to incriminate himself.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.814
Recess...now.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.749
Your Honor, may we have
10 minutes, please?

38:37.783 --> 38:39.918
He's not testifying, period!

38:39.951 --> 38:41.653
Let him.

38:41.687 --> 38:43.589
And let him
incriminate himself?

38:43.622 --> 38:44.990
Exactly.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.125
Are you crazy?

38:47.158 --> 38:48.994
What do you think,
counselor?

38:49.027 --> 38:52.598
A jury's been sworn in
on the criminal case.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.733
A witness has testified.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.102
Do you see where
this is heading?

38:57.135 --> 38:59.605
You gonna screw us over
on this?

38:59.638 --> 39:02.107
Trust me.

39:02.140 --> 39:05.711
Why did you kill
Ted Carthage?

39:05.744 --> 39:07.145
I don't know.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.748
Didn't he kill
your mom?

39:09.781 --> 39:10.716
Yeah.

39:10.749 --> 39:12.818
So are you lying when
you say you don't know?

39:12.851 --> 39:14.653
I'm not lying.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.788
Was your mom
a prostitute?

39:16.822 --> 39:18.156
(Nathan)
I don't know.

39:18.189 --> 39:21.860
(Geddes)
Did you have a nice apartment
when she was alive?

39:21.893 --> 39:23.161
It was okay.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.863
Was there a lot of crime
in the neighborhood?

39:24.896 --> 39:26.097
I guess.

39:26.131 --> 39:28.634
Did you have
a nice life, Nathan?

39:30.902 --> 39:32.037
Yes.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.605
Doesn't sound like it.

39:33.639 --> 39:37.809
How old were you when
your dad was stabbed to death?

39:37.843 --> 39:39.811
S-six.

39:39.845 --> 39:41.813
If you could, would you shoot
the guy who stabbed your dad,

39:41.847 --> 39:43.582
just like you shot
Ted Carthage?

39:43.615 --> 39:44.650
No.

39:44.683 --> 39:45.751
No?! Why not?

39:45.784 --> 39:46.785
He stabbed your father.

39:46.818 --> 39:47.819
I don't wanna kill anybody!

39:47.853 --> 39:49.154
Sure, you did.
You were angry.

39:49.187 --> 39:49.988
No!

39:50.021 --> 39:51.590
Yeah, Ted Carthage
killed your mother.

39:51.623 --> 39:52.758
You hated him.
Stop it!

39:52.791 --> 39:54.125
You didn't kill because
you saw the gun.

39:54.159 --> 39:55.461
You wanted to hurt him!

39:55.494 --> 39:56.995
You hated him,
and you wanted him to die!

39:57.028 --> 39:59.030
Yes, I hated him,
all right?!

40:07.906 --> 40:10.041
Nothing further.

40:19.017 --> 40:21.587
We have no questions
for this witness.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.922
(judge)
Are you sure, Ms. Novak?

40:23.955 --> 40:25.824
I am.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.926
You're excused, son.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.165
Your Honor, at this time,

40:34.199 --> 40:36.034
the defense would move
for a mistrial.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.936
Ms. Devere,
you can't do that.

40:37.969 --> 40:39.905
This is a hearing,
not a trial.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.573
My apologies,
Judge Malloy.

40:41.607 --> 40:42.774
That motion wasn't
made to you.

40:42.808 --> 40:44.576
I'm speaking
to Judge Donnelly.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.912
Nathan Phelps
was compelled

40:46.945 --> 40:49.748
to incriminate himself
in these proceedings.

40:49.781 --> 40:52.751
The testimony is admissible
in his criminal trial

40:52.784 --> 40:54.986
and violates his right
against self-incrimination.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.922
It's grounds for a mistrial.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.891
Motion granted.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.893
The criminal case
against Nathan Phelps

41:01.927 --> 41:04.696
is dismissed
with prejudice.

41:04.730 --> 41:05.731
What?!

41:05.764 --> 41:07.633
In that event,
Judge Malloy,

41:07.666 --> 41:09.067
I move to dismiss
this proceeding.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.136
Now that there is no case
against Nathan Phelps,

41:11.169 --> 41:13.605
there is no reason
to investigate this research.

41:13.639 --> 41:14.940
Your Honor,

41:14.973 --> 41:17.075
this is a set-up,
perpetrated by the DA's office.

41:17.108 --> 41:19.244
Mr. Geddes,
I'd agree with you,

41:19.277 --> 41:23.949
except you're the one who called
Mr. Phelps to the stand.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.250
This action is dismissed.

41:25.283 --> 41:26.552
Court is adjourned.

41:26.585 --> 41:27.853
[bangs gavel]

41:50.976 --> 41:53.945
Killer got a foster family.
That's nice.

41:53.979 --> 41:55.080
You're a jerk, Geddes.

41:55.113 --> 41:56.748
Yeah, and you got
a murderer off.

41:56.782 --> 41:58.684
Nathan Phelps would be
serving the sentence

41:58.717 --> 42:01.152
I had already negotiated
had you not gotten involved.

42:01.186 --> 42:03.221
So why don't we put the blame
where it really belongs:

42:03.254 --> 42:04.289
on your bosses.

42:04.322 --> 42:05.256
Casey...

42:05.290 --> 42:08.126
You honestly believe
that guns cause a disease?

42:09.895 --> 42:11.129
My dad had guns.

42:11.162 --> 42:13.799
He taught me how to use them
when I was a kid.

42:13.832 --> 42:16.968
But I never saw anyone
gunned down in front of me.

42:17.002 --> 42:18.570
Have you?

42:18.604 --> 42:21.206
Taking away guns isn't gonna
cure the world of violence.

42:21.239 --> 42:23.041
Unless the study's true.

42:23.074 --> 42:24.976
Then everything's different,
isn't it?

42:25.010 --> 42:25.076
