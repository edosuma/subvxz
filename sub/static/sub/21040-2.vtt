WEBVTT

00:00.081 --> 00:01.929
- How's it looking?

00:02.156 --> 00:03.875
The tail needs to be longer.

00:04.075 --> 00:05.783
There's a man fallen here!

00:05.824 --> 00:10.125
Niall Swift, 32 years old,
taught local kids piano.

00:10.171 --> 00:13.931
Niall taught Marr's wee girl, said Marr
always made him feel uncomfortable.

00:14.426 --> 00:16.690
Maybe his brain was hooked out
though his nose?

00:16.770 --> 00:19.095
You've a cold blooded
predator in your town.

00:19.164 --> 00:21.644
Niall's phone wasn't on him,
I thought it'd be in here.

00:21.670 --> 00:23.838
You found a dead body,
you were white as a sheet.

00:23.864 --> 00:25.864
I just need some time on my own.

00:25.919 --> 00:28.822
Thank you, see you later, everybody.
Off you go!

00:29.490 --> 00:31.050
What you have here is a human heart.

00:31.076 --> 00:35.196
I'll be bringing in my own team tonight,
which will include Blake Albrighton.

00:35.350 --> 00:36.750
He's a forensic psychologist.

00:36.837 --> 00:40.001
The same day a body is found
with part of its brain removed,

00:40.027 --> 00:42.776
a heart turns up and you think
that's what, bad luck?

00:43.150 --> 00:45.150
Am I off the case?

00:45.364 --> 00:47.576
You're compromised. I'm sorry.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074

00:56.230 --> 00:58.957
The killer dances ahead of us,

00:59.221 --> 01:00.694
leading us through his story.

01:01.905 --> 01:04.574
<i>We need to make our narrative
the dominant one.</i>

01:05.161 --> 01:07.808
And to do that, we have
to understand him.

01:09.643 --> 01:12.842
Niall Swift wasn't the first victim.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.840
Why has the killer
deprived us of that body?

01:18.560 --> 01:19.680
Why just the heart?

01:20.910 --> 01:22.150
Was it someone close to him?

01:23.530 --> 01:24.975
Put a name to that heart,

01:25.000 --> 01:27.024
and I believe it'll lead us
straight to the killer.

02:51.314 --> 02:54.090
Swift's diary. One appointment
the day he was killed.

02:54.116 --> 02:55.655
Isla Marr, 8:00 a.m.

02:55.680 --> 02:58.920
That's Dr. Marr's daughter.
She's like 9 or 10.

02:59.489 --> 03:02.933
Susie, house call to Dr. Marr.
Jason, you go with.

03:02.972 --> 03:07.424
Right, Swift's pupils, their parents,

03:07.450 --> 03:10.185
the names in his address book,
his choir,

03:10.317 --> 03:12.349
talk to every single one of them.

03:12.653 --> 03:14.708
And we're still to find his phone.

03:14.960 --> 03:18.375
Forensics are working on the
newspaper we found on Carn Mohr,

03:18.400 --> 03:20.520
and results will be posted later today.

03:26.027 --> 03:27.425
Evie's plane ticket.

03:27.800 --> 03:28.936
First class.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.218
22,000 Aussie dollars.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.791
My sister's buying my daughter.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.655
Annie, we sat down. We agreed to this.

03:36.680 --> 03:37.935
She's not ready.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.870
You're not ready. Time for another one?

03:39.896 --> 03:41.011
Apparently.

03:41.517 --> 03:42.692
Pretty ironic.

03:42.718 --> 03:43.981
Evie's off in two weeks,

03:44.007 --> 03:46.258
but before she goes, she manages
to screw up my career.

03:46.284 --> 03:48.366
Come on. It's hardly your career.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.916
You know what the new D.C.I. said?

03:53.728 --> 03:55.859
She asked if I was a cop or a mother.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.288
And I couldn't answer.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.642
Right now I'm neither.

04:02.424 --> 04:05.255
Isotopes will tell us
where the owner of the heart was from.

04:05.280 --> 04:08.775
We should have that
information in 48 hours.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.000
Keep in mind the heart could've
been removed postmortem.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.095
Thanks. If you can get in
touch with mortuaries...

04:15.120 --> 04:17.226
I just got a call from
the superintendent.

04:17.986 --> 04:19.223
He called you?

04:19.791 --> 04:21.575
You're in here. I took the call.

04:22.440 --> 04:25.055
Until there's proof the heart
came from a murder victim,

04:25.080 --> 04:26.575
he wants us to proceed on the basis

04:26.600 --> 04:28.485
we're dealing with one homicide.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.175
Did you tell him I think
we need a press conference?

04:31.200 --> 04:33.320
- Passed that on.
- What did he say?

04:34.089 --> 04:35.797
"Dangerously counterproductive."

04:41.600 --> 04:42.857
Evie!

04:44.037 --> 04:45.162
What?

04:48.990 --> 04:50.481
I'm so sorry.

04:51.069 --> 04:52.496
Shouldn't have called you a bitch.

04:53.442 --> 04:54.602
Okay.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.271
Apology accepted.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.036
Your plane ticket arrived. I printed it.

05:08.515 --> 05:09.995
Cheers, big ears.

05:12.461 --> 05:13.462
Evie.

05:13.933 --> 05:15.403
The heart on the shore,

05:15.520 --> 05:18.329
could Jonjo or Kieran have
put it there without you seeing?

05:19.177 --> 05:21.622
For a second I thought you were
going to say something nice.

05:22.560 --> 05:26.049
You realize that if we don't catch the
killer, you can forget about Australia?

05:27.040 --> 05:28.695
- Are you joking?
- No.

05:28.970 --> 05:31.976
D.C.I. Quigley released you
on condition that you stay in the area.

05:32.490 --> 05:34.767
But you will catch him.

05:35.057 --> 05:36.153
Won't you?

05:36.440 --> 05:37.984
If they give me the chance.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.432
Good of you to join us.

06:15.775 --> 06:17.055
I'm early.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.215
Our man on license, Leighton Thomas,

06:19.240 --> 06:20.375
who knows about him?

06:20.400 --> 06:22.975
Three people... myself,
Chief Inspector Smilie,

06:23.000 --> 06:24.735
and his probation officer.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.297
You socialize with him.

06:26.893 --> 06:30.018
He works beside my husband.
It'd be odd if I didn't.

06:30.135 --> 06:32.232
- Your husband know his history?
- No.

06:33.400 --> 06:34.695
Do you regard him as a suspect?

06:34.720 --> 06:36.775
- Everyone's a suspect.
- No, they're not.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.695
Leighton Thomas murdered two men.

06:38.721 --> 06:39.855
20 years ago.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.502
I know when it happened.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.095
His crimes appall me,

06:45.120 --> 06:47.175
but I admire the way
he's turned his life around.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.616
He went to prison,
he couldn't read or write.

06:48.640 --> 06:49.895
He came out with a degree.

06:50.045 --> 06:51.815
I don't think he's a suspect.

06:53.427 --> 06:54.852
Has he got a partner?

06:56.200 --> 06:58.004
No, not that I'm aware of.

06:58.030 --> 06:59.433
How's his business doing?

07:00.480 --> 07:01.961
It's been better.

07:02.305 --> 07:04.415
So, a sexually frustrated loner

07:04.440 --> 07:06.902
with a failing business
and a history of violence,

07:07.012 --> 07:08.833
and you don't think he's a suspect?

07:13.321 --> 07:16.364
Saw the forensic mob heading off.
All sorted, then.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.344
All sorted?

07:20.480 --> 07:21.815
What, just like that?

07:21.840 --> 07:23.523
No "sorry" or...

07:23.700 --> 07:26.075
- It was just a bit of fun.
- A bit of fun?

07:26.280 --> 07:29.017
Your "bit of fun"
could've closed us down.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.372
Use a glass!

07:31.599 --> 07:33.542
It's cool. I'm going to finish it.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.291
And what the hell are you wearing?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.655
- What, this old thing?
- It's my cardigan.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.395
Take it off! Go on!

07:44.333 --> 07:46.181
Bloody ridiculous.

07:49.082 --> 07:50.481
Get yourself dressed.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.151
Go on.

08:08.178 --> 08:10.215
We need a record
of your whereabouts

08:10.240 --> 08:13.661
on Tuesday between 11:00 a.m.
and 1:30 p.m.

08:14.690 --> 08:16.025
I was at work.

08:16.417 --> 08:17.809
Can you prove that?

08:19.360 --> 08:21.615
You've got me documenting
me entire life.

08:21.640 --> 08:22.894
How awful.

08:23.593 --> 08:25.643
At least you've got a life to document.

08:27.600 --> 08:30.294
I took out tours at 11:00,
12:00, and 1:00.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.269
I can show you ticket stubs.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.770
Bring them in today.

08:34.986 --> 08:37.510
We received a call
naming you as the killer.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.530
I bet they didn't give their name.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.447
But why would someone do that?

08:51.052 --> 08:53.535
Some people think I'm damaging
the local economy.

08:53.560 --> 08:54.628
Why?

08:55.720 --> 08:57.172
'Cause I tell the truth.

08:57.598 --> 08:59.742
I tell tourists there is no monster.

09:00.109 --> 09:01.766
I wish that was the case.

09:05.739 --> 09:08.672
Why don't you just lock me up?

09:09.161 --> 09:14.406
Listen, I know what I was,
and I know who I am now.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.164
What were you?

09:21.680 --> 09:23.445
You can't say it, can you?

09:26.800 --> 09:28.540
I was begging to survive.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.287
You get taxed, yeah?

09:32.485 --> 09:33.990
That's part of the game.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.800
But this one bloke, he'd take the lot.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.815
He'd give me a dig, piss on
my blanket every fucking day.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.132
So I hit him.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.335
Bit too much force.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.452
Yeah.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.255
I committed murder.
Is that what you want to hear?

09:48.280 --> 09:51.165
- You got a taste for it?
- Yeah, it felt good.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.671
So I did it again.

09:55.812 --> 09:58.055
That's not who I am now. That was...

09:58.080 --> 09:59.711
I don't even know who that was.

10:08.680 --> 10:09.827
D.S. Redford?

10:11.640 --> 10:13.847
- Annie?
- Yeah, I'm here.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.360
What the hell are you doing down there?

10:17.520 --> 10:18.895
I've got an important job for you.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.378
Need you to drive up
to the Wildlife Center.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.938
Some zoomer's released
a couple of wolves.

10:25.646 --> 10:26.686
Right.

10:28.286 --> 10:29.554
Thanks.

10:34.664 --> 10:36.473
Are you handing yourself in?

10:36.800 --> 10:38.175
Your boss wants a statement.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.495
Don't worry.
I'll say you were competent.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.520
Cow.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.582
So, did Leighton say anything?

10:44.608 --> 10:47.083
- About what?
- About me.

10:48.094 --> 10:50.440
He asked if you did your makeup
on a trampoline.

10:54.267 --> 10:55.323
Annie.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.381
I like him.

11:01.760 --> 11:03.393
Don't get involved.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.246
Trust me.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.920
Wait here. I think he's in his study.

12:07.179 --> 12:09.533
Craig? It's the police.

12:12.077 --> 12:13.757
Decent gaff.

12:23.562 --> 12:25.004
- Morning.
- Morning.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.521
- This won't take long, will it?
- No.

12:28.045 --> 12:29.322
Please, come in.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.055
I usually leave the college
just after 1:00,

12:36.080 --> 12:37.775
run for about 40, 45 minutes.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.015
Anyone to back that up?

12:39.040 --> 12:40.575
Yeah, you can ask my staff.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.000
Are you watching your time?

12:42.611 --> 12:45.716
Yeah, I've got to be at work
in about 10 minutes, okay?

12:46.357 --> 12:48.255
Paragraph four
of your statement,

12:48.280 --> 12:50.775
"I assumed from the head
injuries he was dead."

12:50.998 --> 12:52.498
You feel for a pulse?

12:52.680 --> 12:53.855
No.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.849
You didn't touch him
in any way at all?

12:56.048 --> 12:57.130
No.

12:57.466 --> 13:00.015
Lorraine Mackeson,
the woman whose phone you used,

13:00.040 --> 13:03.973
she saw you stand up and put
something into your jacket.

13:04.423 --> 13:05.527
Right.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.335
What did you put into your jacket?

13:09.100 --> 13:10.340
I don't know.

13:11.400 --> 13:14.015
<i>No, wait. It must have been my phone.</i>

13:14.040 --> 13:15.601
I couldn't get a signal, so...

13:16.560 --> 13:18.775
You teach classes,
as well as run the college?

13:18.800 --> 13:21.274
Yeah, I teach whenever I can.
I still love it.

13:21.720 --> 13:25.015
I interviewed some of your
students about their practical joke.

13:27.367 --> 13:28.367
Okay.

13:28.453 --> 13:29.694
You encourage them?

13:29.738 --> 13:30.738
No.

13:30.801 --> 13:32.452
They seem impressionable.

13:33.653 --> 13:35.645
Well, they're openminded.

13:36.174 --> 13:37.412
Tell them off?

13:40.470 --> 13:42.638
I admire what they did.

13:43.244 --> 13:44.591
Polluting a beach?

13:45.753 --> 13:47.714
Well, it's all part
of growing up, isn't it?

13:48.119 --> 13:51.094
Rejecting your hometown,
your parents' values.

13:51.520 --> 13:52.782
We've all done it.

13:54.059 --> 13:55.233
Have we?

14:01.671 --> 14:03.375
He's lying about something.

14:03.400 --> 14:05.173
Got a bit defensive, didn't he?

14:05.520 --> 14:07.595
Did you notice him locking
the door of his study?

14:07.926 --> 14:09.056
I did.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.120
Sh...

15:22.787 --> 15:23.867
You need a tow?

15:26.200 --> 15:27.280
Yeah.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.060
Are you sure you've
got the right night?

17:04.060 --> 17:06.356
Pause it. Zoom in.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.646
Jonjo.

17:14.857 --> 17:16.469
Thought you'd turned a corner.

17:28.659 --> 17:31.268
- Um, I need to go. Is that all right?
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

17:42.180 --> 17:43.868
You don't think that's weird?

17:44.557 --> 17:45.758
Not all that.

17:46.812 --> 17:49.749
The heart on the beach. That could
be the rest of the body right there.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.240
It's not big enough.

17:51.359 --> 17:54.344
The guy's a doctor.
It could be body parts.

17:55.090 --> 17:57.546
You really don't like Dr. Marr, do you?

17:59.945 --> 18:01.185
What's the deal?

18:12.300 --> 18:13.551
I had...

18:15.340 --> 18:16.782
a lump.

18:17.709 --> 18:18.985
It was nothing.

18:20.980 --> 18:22.890
He examined me and he...

18:26.140 --> 18:27.833
took too long.

18:34.656 --> 18:35.970
Did you tell your mum?

18:37.380 --> 18:39.165
- Are you kidding me?
- Why not?

18:39.300 --> 18:41.749
She already thinks
I can't look after myself.

18:42.060 --> 18:43.934
I'm not giving her more ammunition.

18:50.877 --> 18:52.411
You got this from Carn Mohr?

18:52.535 --> 18:54.735
It came out the day
Niall Swift was killed.

18:55.721 --> 18:56.896
Prints?

18:56.937 --> 18:59.117
Three partial prints,
one partial hypothenar.

18:59.143 --> 19:00.235
No matches.

19:01.085 --> 19:02.962
You think it was dropped by the killer.

19:03.065 --> 19:04.265
Or a witness.

19:06.139 --> 19:09.514
Pages 37 and 38 have been torn out.

19:09.866 --> 19:11.604
Yeah, we did notice.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.235
I need to see Carn Mohr for myself.

19:16.260 --> 19:17.435
Do you want me to come with?

19:17.460 --> 19:19.180
Nah, you're good. Thanks.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.540
Sure.

19:29.458 --> 19:30.851
Seems to be fine.

19:34.152 --> 19:36.434
Hey, look at my new toy.

19:45.380 --> 19:46.837
Check this out.

19:47.857 --> 19:49.379
Builtin computer.

19:49.647 --> 19:52.142
Sends HD images to your laptop.

19:52.300 --> 19:53.710
Sealed camera unit.

19:53.784 --> 19:56.239
Rotates, tilts, hovers, pans.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.207
You're looking at the future.

19:59.215 --> 20:00.841
I'm not buying your sonar.

20:01.138 --> 20:03.308
Cool. I'll sell it on eBay.

20:05.540 --> 20:06.961
How much was your drone?

20:07.380 --> 20:09.212
3 grand plus VAT.

20:09.429 --> 20:11.008
Not a word to Annie.

20:15.350 --> 20:16.521
I envy you.

20:17.223 --> 20:18.223
Yeah?

20:19.486 --> 20:21.224
You got your monster down there.

20:22.512 --> 20:25.392
Swimming around.
Never breaks the surface.

20:25.951 --> 20:27.471
You know, most people...

20:28.694 --> 20:30.243
their monsters are in here.

20:32.300 --> 20:33.735
Scratching to get out.

20:46.180 --> 20:47.220
Evie.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.432
Your mum's not here.

20:52.216 --> 20:53.319
Can I help?

21:03.300 --> 21:05.755
Do I have to stay in Lochnafoy
till you catch the killer?

21:05.781 --> 21:07.806
Unless I say otherwise, yes.

21:08.260 --> 21:09.530
Miss Evelyn.

21:09.556 --> 21:10.811
Mr. Jason.

21:11.060 --> 21:12.352
What you here for?

21:12.672 --> 21:14.435
Never mind what she's here for.

21:14.460 --> 21:16.279
Get your cap. We're off out.

21:20.175 --> 21:22.335
Is he what passes for talent
'round here?

21:46.140 --> 21:47.396
I don't get this.

21:49.020 --> 21:51.771
Your forensic team was here all night.

21:53.220 --> 21:54.835
Are you trying to put
me out of business?

21:54.860 --> 21:55.860
Ken?

21:56.460 --> 21:58.555
Frank, Frank. What's going on?

21:58.580 --> 22:01.517
I've no idea. What did she say?

22:02.331 --> 22:03.411
Ma'am?

22:05.780 --> 22:07.317
Shit..

22:09.020 --> 22:10.715
For God sake!

22:10.740 --> 22:13.885
This area's marked
"human consumption only."

22:14.060 --> 22:15.799
I need you to step outside.

22:16.020 --> 22:18.115
I've no idea how that got here.

22:18.140 --> 22:21.595
- Frank, can you sort...
- I need you to step outside.

22:21.739 --> 22:22.957
P.C. Denny.

22:23.860 --> 22:26.483
You've certainly got
your priorities worked out.

22:30.231 --> 22:31.803
Why are you here, Frank?

22:32.460 --> 22:35.635
This is a dynamite lead.
You want me to call forensics?

22:35.660 --> 22:38.076
These premises will have to shut
until Food Standards get here.

22:38.100 --> 22:39.755
Food Standards see that, it's game over.

22:39.780 --> 22:40.901
Their call.

22:41.980 --> 22:44.395
Some idiot let it out
the Wildlife Center.

22:44.420 --> 22:46.635
What's it got to do
with your investigation?

22:46.660 --> 22:49.515
What, he's your mate,
so I should turn a blind eye?

22:49.540 --> 22:51.097
You still operate like that?

22:51.191 --> 22:53.161
You report this, he's finished.

22:53.607 --> 22:55.273
I'm not going to do that.

22:55.980 --> 22:57.173
<i>You are.</i>

23:32.616 --> 23:35.739
- What's going on?
- I don't really know.

23:35.765 --> 23:38.576
Somebody's trying to get us shut down.
That's what's going on.

23:38.788 --> 23:40.836
- Well, what did Frank say?
- He says his hands are tied.

23:40.860 --> 23:42.955
What does he mean his hands are tied?

23:42.980 --> 23:45.395
Look, I know this isn't ideal,
but I need to talk to Jonjo.

23:45.420 --> 23:46.675
He's at college.

23:46.700 --> 23:47.937
I've tried there.

23:51.660 --> 23:53.748
- What is it?
- Annie needs to speak to Jonjo.

23:53.936 --> 23:54.951
Why?

23:55.140 --> 23:56.443
Just a couple of questions.

23:56.469 --> 23:57.708
He's not at college.

23:58.402 --> 23:59.660
I can come back.

23:59.686 --> 24:01.086
Yeah, do that.

24:02.384 --> 24:03.544
He's upset.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.915
That lad claims
Dr. Marr gave him 20 quid

24:16.940 --> 24:18.195
to incinerate the beast.

24:18.220 --> 24:20.508
He didn't want it attracting vermin.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.461
Get a statement from Marr.

24:22.740 --> 24:25.405
I know it's bullshit, but now
we've got to deal with it.

24:25.608 --> 24:28.048
And tell Evie false alarm.

24:42.561 --> 24:44.481
What an arse!

24:45.540 --> 24:46.853
All right, lezzers?

25:04.740 --> 25:05.874
Evie!

25:06.392 --> 25:07.472
Shit.

25:08.460 --> 25:09.980
Tell me she didn't see.

25:15.580 --> 25:16.987
What's the story?

25:17.256 --> 25:18.351
About what?

25:18.540 --> 25:19.887
About the abattoir.

25:21.500 --> 25:24.784
Jonjo uploaded a film,
Dr. Marr dropping something off.

25:24.891 --> 25:25.996
A wolf.

25:27.030 --> 25:28.182
Right.

25:28.548 --> 25:29.950
What did you think it was?

25:30.293 --> 25:31.566
I don't know.

25:31.823 --> 25:33.381
Have you a problem with Marr?

25:34.285 --> 25:35.710
I'm late for class.

25:44.933 --> 25:47.327
He's with a patient. I'll message him.

25:47.500 --> 25:50.018
- Got your own phone.
- It was my mum's.

25:50.044 --> 25:51.539
I'm not allowed online.

25:51.620 --> 25:53.267
Should think not at your age.

25:54.780 --> 25:56.603
My daughter was learning piano, too.

25:59.540 --> 26:01.043
You had a lesson the other day?

26:01.735 --> 26:02.932
Yes.

26:05.822 --> 26:07.822
It's okay to be sad, sweetheart.

26:09.050 --> 26:10.507
I feel sad, too.

26:11.057 --> 26:13.635
Dad told him not to come back.

26:15.471 --> 26:17.191
Okay, Isla, scoot.

26:19.305 --> 26:20.795
I've already spoken to a detective.

26:20.820 --> 26:22.115
I've got a patient waiting.

26:22.140 --> 26:25.824
One of the abattoir workers claims you
paid him to incinerate a wolf carcass?

26:27.300 --> 26:30.084
- That's why you're here?
- I need the statement corroborated.

26:30.698 --> 26:34.159
Okay. I ran over a wolf.
It's corroborated.

26:34.323 --> 26:35.611
Why didn't you say

26:35.637 --> 26:37.533
that Niall Swift taught your daughter?

26:38.220 --> 26:40.475
At the foot of Carn Mohr,
you didn't mention

26:40.500 --> 26:43.103
that he'd been in your house
a few hours earlier.

26:43.312 --> 26:45.697
Well, would that have helped?

26:46.001 --> 26:48.506
"He's dead,
but he was alive this morning."

26:48.665 --> 26:50.519
Was everything okay when he left?

26:51.060 --> 26:52.556
I've already spoken
to a detective about...

26:52.580 --> 26:54.086
What did you argue about?

26:54.740 --> 26:56.547
Are you on the investigation team?

26:58.129 --> 26:59.195
No, I'm not.

26:59.220 --> 27:02.892
No. So I'm really too busy for this.

27:57.500 --> 27:58.638
Great.

28:05.860 --> 28:07.108
Jonjo?

28:08.340 --> 28:09.460
Jonjo?

28:12.660 --> 28:13.846
He's not here.

28:21.540 --> 28:23.022
Jonjo.

28:48.540 --> 28:49.875
Something wrong with your car?

28:49.900 --> 28:52.020
No, it's fine. Just won't go.

28:52.904 --> 28:54.170
Do you want me to take a look?

28:54.296 --> 28:55.827
My husband's on his way.

28:57.501 --> 28:59.741
Well, I can wait with you
till he gets here if you want.

29:00.704 --> 29:02.249
I'll understand if you said no.

29:02.683 --> 29:04.630
I think I can trust you.

29:10.330 --> 29:11.715
So, do any of the locals

29:11.740 --> 29:13.635
actually believe there's
something down there?

29:15.060 --> 29:16.832
- Some.
- The crazy ones.

29:16.858 --> 29:17.873
Yeah.

29:17.980 --> 29:19.234
I'm married to one.

29:22.765 --> 29:23.853
Okay.

29:25.493 --> 29:28.129
Well, I suppose we all
have our crazy beliefs.

29:30.567 --> 29:32.142
What are yours?

29:32.558 --> 29:33.824
Your husband?

29:34.900 --> 29:36.449
Come to save me.

29:37.413 --> 29:38.996
I'm D.S. Redford.

29:39.419 --> 29:40.755
Right.

29:40.780 --> 29:43.152
- Blake Albright...
- I know who you are.

29:45.127 --> 29:46.594
You found the newspaper.

29:48.500 --> 29:49.722
All right?

29:50.226 --> 29:51.810
This is Blake Albrighton.

29:52.280 --> 29:53.501
Alan Redford.

29:53.799 --> 29:55.653
Are you all right
to bring me to the station?

29:56.353 --> 29:58.835
Actually, I was going to ask

29:58.860 --> 30:00.688
if you could show me
where you found the body.

30:01.899 --> 30:03.395
If that's not a problem.

30:03.420 --> 30:04.551
It's not a problem.

30:04.980 --> 30:07.026
- I'll sort out the car.
- Thanks.

30:25.288 --> 30:27.794
According to Jung,
we all have a shadow,

30:27.820 --> 30:30.482
a dark part of ourselves.

30:30.860 --> 30:33.195
It's a part that we fear,
but, at the same time,

30:33.220 --> 30:36.395
there is an overwhelming desire
to let it loose.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.595
Whoever keyed my motor,
I'm gonna fucking have you!

30:38.620 --> 30:41.380
Mr. Baxter, please don't
come in here making threats.

30:42.020 --> 30:45.380
Sit down and shut up.

30:54.027 --> 30:55.460
As I was saying,

30:55.486 --> 31:00.926
Jung believed that the shadow
was a vital part of ourselves.

31:11.289 --> 31:14.478
- How far to Carn Mohr?
- 10 minutes, then the climb.

31:15.333 --> 31:16.825
Does this commemorate something?

31:19.420 --> 31:20.740
Not this one.

31:24.380 --> 31:25.532
What is it?

31:26.563 --> 31:27.715
It's grown.

31:27.740 --> 31:29.990
I pass this way three, four times a day.

31:31.700 --> 31:33.436
Well, anyone going by
could add to it, couldn't they?

31:33.460 --> 31:34.612
Yeah, they do, but...

31:34.974 --> 31:37.454
this has doubled in size
in the last two days.

32:07.420 --> 32:09.903
That is the rest of Niall Swift's brain.

32:18.420 --> 32:19.942
Okay, well, thanks very much.

32:29.100 --> 32:30.275
- You all right?
- Hiya.

32:30.300 --> 32:31.418
It's just a routine check.

32:31.444 --> 32:33.725
You haven't seen anyone
adding to the cairn

32:33.751 --> 32:35.086
in the last two days, have you?

32:35.112 --> 32:36.287
The cairn? No.

32:36.380 --> 32:37.500
Okay.

32:41.100 --> 32:42.420
See you.

32:51.334 --> 32:52.669
Why isn't she on the team?

32:53.077 --> 32:54.635
I've got everybody I need.

32:54.660 --> 32:56.035
And D.S. Redford's last case

32:56.060 --> 32:58.367
involved the theft
of an inflatable Nessie.

32:59.845 --> 33:02.939
You know Dr. Marr sacked Niall Swift
the morning of his murder?

33:04.103 --> 33:06.640
D.S. Redford got the information
from his daughter.

33:07.394 --> 33:09.594
- Her local knowledge...
- We better bring him in, then.

33:09.860 --> 33:12.300
- The point I'm making is...
- I know the point you're making.

33:12.740 --> 33:15.635
Her daughter and her pals
left the bones on the beach.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.436
Until I'm convinced they know
nothing about the heart,

33:17.460 --> 33:19.241
D.S. Redford is compromised.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.190
Plus, you fancy her.

33:21.980 --> 33:23.326
No, I don't.

33:23.373 --> 33:26.265
I'm a detective. I detect things.

33:26.423 --> 33:27.788
She's not my type.

33:27.967 --> 33:30.589
She's married. She's exactly your type.

33:30.954 --> 33:33.258
Have you ever thought about
getting any help with that?

33:39.955 --> 33:41.893
Jonjo's phone's just ringing out.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.635
Fucking Food Standards.

33:43.660 --> 33:45.635
Been on hold 20 minutes.

33:45.660 --> 33:48.195
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, I heard.

33:48.220 --> 33:49.893
You don't think
I've enough to deal with?

33:50.321 --> 33:51.976
Can you not leave that?

33:52.380 --> 33:54.515
We've got to find out
what he's done with his pills.

33:54.540 --> 33:56.343
What do you think he's done, Nicole?

33:56.369 --> 33:57.635
He's chucked them.

33:57.700 --> 33:59.715
Like before and the time before that.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.546
The time he ended up in hospital.

34:08.029 --> 34:10.063
I've fitted a new starter motor.

34:10.980 --> 34:13.092
Should be good for another 10 years.

34:14.759 --> 34:16.063
Are you still at it?

34:16.540 --> 34:18.714
Couple of assignments to finish
before I go.

34:19.500 --> 34:20.715
Heard from your mum?

34:20.739 --> 34:22.125
Nah, she'll be at work.

34:49.436 --> 34:51.114
We've had a couple of calls

34:51.139 --> 34:53.938
telling us to investigate
a Desmond Toner.

34:55.245 --> 34:56.596
Dessie, yeah.

34:57.020 --> 34:58.635
He's in my daughter's year at college.

34:58.660 --> 34:59.860
He gets bullied.

35:00.671 --> 35:02.111
The calls are a windup.

35:07.060 --> 35:09.540
I'm going to tell you
something in confidence.

35:10.821 --> 35:13.155
A superintendent's post
has become vacant.

35:13.180 --> 35:14.264
I'm up for it.

35:14.580 --> 35:17.166
Everything I do here
is being scrutinized.

35:17.540 --> 35:18.955
If I put you on the team,

35:18.980 --> 35:20.795
is there the slightest chance
I'd regret it?

35:20.820 --> 35:22.075
Absolutely not.

35:22.100 --> 35:24.241
I'll do everything I can
to make this work.

35:24.460 --> 35:25.600
No more screwups.

35:25.626 --> 35:26.626
No.

35:40.020 --> 35:41.155
Annie.

35:41.180 --> 35:43.755
Alan, I'm back on the team!

35:43.780 --> 35:46.755
Aye. What team's
that, curling team?

35:46.780 --> 35:48.675
You could at least
pretend to be pleased.

35:48.700 --> 35:50.340
Of course I'm pleased.

35:52.980 --> 35:54.380
He sounds different.

35:55.380 --> 35:56.843
Mum?

35:57.260 --> 35:58.815
Do you think
his breathing's easier?

35:58.841 --> 35:59.922
Maybe.

36:02.912 --> 36:04.232
You want to get that?

37:02.980 --> 37:04.776
- Hiya, love.
- Hi.

37:05.020 --> 37:06.315
Is he okay?

37:06.566 --> 37:08.463
Yeah. He's fine.

37:17.540 --> 37:18.780
Check your phone.

37:20.633 --> 37:21.888
Jonjo.

37:22.060 --> 37:23.955
He knows something about Marr.

37:23.980 --> 37:25.995
Why would he want to meet us
at Foyers Point?

37:26.020 --> 37:27.195
He's hiding.

37:27.220 --> 37:28.443
What for?

37:28.620 --> 37:31.155
Who do you think cut the fence
at the Wildlife Center?

37:31.180 --> 37:32.767
What a plonk.

37:33.060 --> 37:34.435
We have wheels.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.975
What, your mum doesn't mind?

37:36.819 --> 37:37.981
She doesn't know.

37:42.778 --> 37:44.355
Who is going to give me some good news

37:44.380 --> 37:46.149
on Niall Swift's phone?

37:48.241 --> 37:49.936
What about the rope, Jason?

37:50.177 --> 37:53.315
Yeah, Lochnafoy Valley
stores on the main street

37:53.340 --> 37:54.578
sell a few every week.

37:54.604 --> 37:57.555
Now, that's mainly to tourists
who have hired a boat

37:57.672 --> 37:59.835
and, want to tie down their weans.

38:00.060 --> 38:02.758
But he can't remember
any locals buying one.

38:03.333 --> 38:04.481
Okay.

38:04.998 --> 38:06.835
While respecting his anonymity,

38:06.860 --> 38:10.155
we need to find out the kind
of rope Leighton Thomas uses.

38:10.180 --> 38:11.395
Yeah, I should've mentioned,

38:11.420 --> 38:14.623
Leighton Thomas brought in his
ticket stubs for last Tuesday.

38:14.649 --> 38:18.075
He took out tours at 11:00 a.m.,
12:00, and 1:00.

38:18.100 --> 38:19.635
So I've I photocopied them.

38:19.660 --> 38:20.799
Right.

38:21.020 --> 38:24.635
About 10 minutes ago,
we got preliminary results

38:24.660 --> 38:26.794
on the gray matter found at the cairn.

38:27.035 --> 38:30.583
As we expected, it is a sliver
of brain from Niall Swift.

38:31.126 --> 38:32.955
It was found in clear polyethylene.

38:32.980 --> 38:34.260
Plastic bag.

38:35.160 --> 38:36.368
I asked my colleagues

38:36.394 --> 38:39.235
to test the viscous material
inside the bag.

38:39.260 --> 38:40.612
Turned out to be blood.

38:40.940 --> 38:43.675
We were able to extract DNA
from the blood.

38:44.071 --> 38:46.700
To our surprise,
it didn't match the brain.

38:49.980 --> 38:51.977
We might be looking at another victim.

38:52.287 --> 38:53.603
Could be the killer's blood.

38:53.900 --> 38:55.454
It's not the killer's blood.

38:56.268 --> 38:57.740
He's too smart for that.

38:59.060 --> 39:00.640
He's turning the screw.

39:07.940 --> 39:09.460
It's about Jonjo.

39:10.060 --> 39:11.540
It's probably nothing.

39:13.260 --> 39:15.100
He's been missing since this morning.

39:16.013 --> 39:18.868
Is that out of the ordinary for Jonjo?

39:19.244 --> 39:21.366
Have you caught the person
who killed the piano teacher?

39:21.390 --> 39:22.421
No.

39:22.447 --> 39:24.588
Well, it's out of the ordinary,
then, isn't it?

39:24.840 --> 39:26.522
For God's sake, Frank!

39:29.980 --> 39:31.153
Ken?

39:33.940 --> 39:35.789
I'm worried about my boy.

39:38.420 --> 39:40.060
Colleges. No disturbed graves.

39:40.086 --> 39:43.461
We've a missing teenager.
Jonjo Patterson.

39:44.241 --> 39:45.475
Our Communications Officer

39:45.500 --> 39:48.580
is organizing a media appeal
for tomorrow.

39:49.540 --> 39:52.475
<i>Local press, Record, Herald, STV News.</i>

39:52.617 --> 39:55.977
One simple message...
Help us find this boy.

39:56.700 --> 39:57.860
Nothing else.

40:05.768 --> 40:07.555
If Jonjo found out
something about Marr,

40:07.580 --> 40:08.875
why didn't he just tell us?

40:08.900 --> 40:09.995
I don't know.

40:10.020 --> 40:12.327
He's not going to make it up,
though, is he?

40:12.731 --> 40:15.407
No? What about that bullshit
this morning?

40:15.580 --> 40:18.155
All he had to do was talk
to the slaughterhouse dude.

40:18.266 --> 40:20.066
"It's a wolf. It's no big deal."

40:27.134 --> 40:28.574
Hey, there's something behind us.

40:29.090 --> 40:30.425
I can't see anything.

40:30.768 --> 40:33.235
- They've got their lights off.
- Are you sure?

40:33.260 --> 40:35.060
Yes, I'm sure.
There's someone following us.

40:37.048 --> 40:38.328
There, see?

40:41.620 --> 40:44.515
- Slow down. Evie!
- Well, they're right behind us.

40:45.169 --> 40:46.996
Well, it'll be some dick
who's forgot his lights.

40:47.020 --> 40:48.875
- Just let it pass.
- What if it's him?

40:48.900 --> 40:50.595
- Who?
- The killer. What if it's him?

40:50.620 --> 40:52.460
I'll take my chances! Slow down!

40:56.393 --> 40:57.793
- Shit!
- Okay.

41:02.900 --> 41:04.875
What the hell's he doing?

41:04.900 --> 41:06.075
Pull over. Get off the road.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.436
Look, I can't.
Where am I supposed to go?

41:07.460 --> 41:09.063
He's getting closer!

41:10.734 --> 41:12.134
Kieran, what should I do?

41:15.140 --> 41:17.020
- God.
- Ditches!

41:24.500 --> 41:25.675
Shit!

41:35.980 --> 41:37.300
Are you okay?

41:38.904 --> 41:41.195
My mum cannot know about this.

41:41.220 --> 41:42.595
We could've been killed.

41:42.620 --> 41:44.715
She finds out, I'm grounded for life.

41:44.740 --> 41:47.016
God Almighty, Evie,
you have to say something.

41:47.282 --> 41:48.555
What good will that do?

41:48.790 --> 41:50.036
If that was the killer, we'd be dead.

41:50.060 --> 41:52.444
It was just some colossal douche...

41:53.529 --> 41:54.984
- Shit.
- Drive.

41:55.971 --> 41:57.475
For fuck's sake!

41:57.500 --> 41:59.795
Quick! He's got a gun!

42:00.149 --> 42:01.395
Evie?

42:01.420 --> 42:02.595
Mr. McGrellish.

42:02.620 --> 42:03.823
Are you all right?

42:20.055 --> 42:21.472
I thought we were going for a nightcap.

42:21.496 --> 42:23.016
I changed my mind.

42:23.815 --> 42:25.213
Work's easier, right?

42:25.501 --> 42:27.436
Complete copy of the newspaper.

42:27.462 --> 42:29.315
He tore the crossword out of his.

42:29.340 --> 42:30.820
Why would he do that?

42:32.898 --> 42:36.038
Leighton Thomas, Petrie, Marr.

42:37.410 --> 42:39.830
I want to know why Petrie
needs a locked room.

42:41.340 --> 42:42.420
Look.

42:44.269 --> 42:45.995
Page opposite the crossword.

42:46.020 --> 42:47.136
Can you see that?

42:49.460 --> 42:50.395
Yeah, sort of.

42:50.420 --> 42:52.195
If we can get that enhanced,

42:52.220 --> 42:53.878
we could have the killer's handwriting.

42:55.586 --> 42:57.051
His first mistake.

43:58.153 --> 44:00.171
Tell him about your
encounter with Nessie.

44:01.125 --> 44:04.580
I'm still gonna live here
when you've fucked off.

44:04.705 --> 44:09.048
Thanks to Albrighton, you're going to be
operating with the world's press up your arse.

44:09.222 --> 44:10.953
I want him gone. D'you hear?

44:10.979 --> 44:13.219
This is a restricted area.

44:13.700 --> 44:17.693
There's somebody in our
town killing people!

44:17.940 --> 44:19.940
You don't play piano, do you?

44:21.260 --> 44:24.352
Your manner is hostile and aggressive.

44:25.204 --> 44:27.204
You need to let this go, Velma.

44:30.724 --> 44:33.690
A wound doesn't heal if
you keep opening it up.
