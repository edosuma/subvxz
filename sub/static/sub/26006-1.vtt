No, you stupid puppet.

02:41.894 --> 02:42.993
Perhaps a song?

02:42.995 --> 02:44.227
Let's take his eye.

02:44.229 --> 02:46.563
What? Ow. No, no, fellas, cut it out!

02:46.565 --> 02:48.332
You give that back

02:48.334 --> 02:50.767
Hey, hey.
Give him his eye back.

02:50.769 --> 02:53.035
It's too early

03:03.716 --> 03:05.548
Look,
times have changed.

03:05.550 --> 03:07.850
You don't have to sing and
dance for the man anymore.

03:07.852 --> 03:10.686

I want to.

Well, I will, uh,
happily relay your message.

03:27.972 --> 03:28.975
Thank you.

03:29.942 --> 03:31.141
Hey, Mr. P.

03:31.143 --> 03:32.912
Oh, hey, there, Bubbles.

03:33.878 --> 03:37.147
How are you, dear?
Here's your Zuggler bar.

03:37.149 --> 03:41.584
Oh, Mr. P, you're
gonna give me a very fat butt.

03:41.586 --> 03:44.387
Oh, come on, stop it.
Any calls?

03:44.389 --> 03:45.956
Uh, yeah,
Detective Edwards called.

03:45.958 --> 03:47.724
She wants you to call
her back right away.

03:47.726 --> 03:50.025
Did you tell her that I was in
Minnesota attending a funeral

03:50.027 --> 03:53.162
because my Aunt Ruby tragically
died in a Zamboni incident?

03:53.164 --> 03:55.665
- Of course.
- Yeah? What'd she say?

03:55.667 --> 03:58.635
She said, "I'd like to
sew your asshole shut

03:58.637 --> 04:02.942
"and just keep feeding you, and
feeding you, and feeding you."

04:05.176 --> 04:06.645
That's a new one.

04:06.878 --> 04:07.878
Yup.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.578
I guess she heard
about those guys already.

04:09.580 --> 04:11.047
Yeah. How'd that go
this morning?

04:11.049 --> 04:14.417
Good. For puppet poachers,
they were real sweethearts.

04:14.419 --> 04:16.420
100% pure puppet.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.786
Straight from Tijuana.

04:17.789 --> 04:19.689
Guaranteed to bring you
good luck.

04:19.690 --> 04:22.994
Don't you know that poaching
puppets for their feet is illegal?

04:30.602 --> 04:32.169
Holy crap, I'm exhausted.

04:34.739 --> 04:36.206
So, yeah. I think
it went very well.

04:36.208 --> 04:38.141
Oh, we have a new client.

04:38.143 --> 04:39.679
I put her in your office.

04:42.448 --> 04:43.646
Detective Philips?

04:43.648 --> 04:46.081
I... I used to be.

04:46.083 --> 04:49.186
Not anymore, I'm a PI now.

04:49.188 --> 04:50.987
How can I help you, Miss...

04:50.989 --> 04:53.523
White, Sandra White.

04:53.525 --> 04:55.661
I received this
in the mail today.

05:07.104 --> 05:08.537
Hmm.
What's your secret?

05:08.539 --> 05:11.475
Well, despite
my bookish appearance,

05:11.477 --> 05:13.210
I'm a sexual I'mma.

05:13.212 --> 05:14.345
What's that?

05:14.347 --> 05:19.085
It means, if I'mma get next
to it, I'mma gonna fuck it.

05:20.818 --> 05:23.686
- Come again?
- Exactly.

05:23.688 --> 05:28.960
And again, and again,
and again.

05:29.561 --> 05:31.026
Mmm. I see.

05:31.028 --> 05:36.165
If my proclivities were to be exposed,
it would be devastating to my family.

05:36.167 --> 05:38.568
Please, if you
could help me,

05:38.570 --> 05:41.972
I would be
so grateful.

05:41.974 --> 05:46.775
Uh, I appreciate grateful, but
it's $300 a day, plus expenses.

05:46.777 --> 05:47.843
Hmm.

05:47.845 --> 05:49.746
This ought
to start you off.

05:49.748 --> 05:51.814
Thank you, Mr. Philips.

05:51.816 --> 05:53.583
<i>I should've
turned her down,</i>

05:53.585 --> 05:55.819
<i>but I like a little cushion
for my cushion.</i>

05:55.821 --> 05:57.722
<i>And I needed the money.</i>

05:58.857 --> 06:01.092
I've seen
that "P" before.

06:06.532 --> 06:11.033
<i>The case was on, so I headed
downtown to see a friend.</i>

06:11.035 --> 06:15.240
<i>Actually, not really a friend,
more of a disgusting acquaintance.</i>

06:18.576 --> 06:19.643
Vinny.

06:21.780 --> 06:23.916
Hey, Vin, it's Phil.

06:26.150 --> 06:27.152
Vinny?

06:29.655 --> 06:32.756
- Phil, wow. Hi.
- Hey...

06:32.758 --> 06:35.225
Sweet mother of God, what the
fuck are you doing back there?

06:35.227 --> 06:40.297
Oh, yeah, it's <i>Cows Gone
Sour 2, Even Milkier.</i>

06:40.299 --> 06:42.032
- Oh, that's good.
- Moo!

06:42.034 --> 06:43.434
What the fuck?

06:43.436 --> 06:47.203
Yeah, the Internet's killing me,
so I'm creating my own content.

06:47.205 --> 06:48.237
Oh, oh, oh!

06:48.239 --> 06:50.874
Jesus Christ. Shut the
curtains, would you?

06:50.876 --> 06:53.175
All right,
if it bothers you.

06:53.177 --> 06:55.011
When did you get
so squeamish?

06:55.013 --> 06:57.314
When did I get squeamish?
I'm not squeamish.

06:57.316 --> 06:58.549
- I'm not squeamish.
- Yeah, you are.

06:58.551 --> 07:02.085
I just don't wanna watch an
eight-arm reach-around, all right?

07:02.087 --> 07:03.453
Okay.

07:03.455 --> 07:06.021
Uh, listen, do you have the latest
issue of <i>Puppet Pussy Party?</i>

07:06.023 --> 07:07.059
Hmm?

07:07.659 --> 07:09.359
<i>Puppet Pussy Party.</i>

07:09.361 --> 07:12.696
Yeah, I saw that... We got one just in.
Let's see.

07:12.698 --> 07:15.665
- Oh, great.
- <i>Felt Fetish Furburger.</i>

Ah!

07:20.772 --> 07:23.639
Here we go,
<i>Puppet Pussy Party.</i>

07:23.641 --> 07:24.843
Yeah.

07:26.277 --> 07:27.813
That's right.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.080
- Bingo.
- Hmm?

07:30.082 --> 07:33.316
Looks like this mystery is brought
to you by the letter "P."

07:33.318 --> 07:35.819
Oh, Phil, if you like pee,
I have a whole rack of...

07:35.821 --> 07:38.888
No. Excuse me, I don't...
No, I don't like pee.

07:38.890 --> 07:41.256
- Vinny, I don't like pee.
- Oh.

07:41.258 --> 07:43.028
I'm on a case.

07:43.261 --> 07:44.727
Oh.

07:44.729 --> 07:49.264
Listen, um, do you keep a record of
which customers bought what magazines?

07:49.266 --> 07:52.835
Yeah, of course, Phil.
We're fully NSA compliant.

07:52.837 --> 07:54.071
Do you think I could
see those?

07:54.073 --> 07:57.407
Absolutely, um, it's in the
office behind the theater.

07:57.409 --> 07:59.742
Thanks, Vin. You know
I appreciate it, huh?

07:59.744 --> 08:00.912
You're welcome.

08:02.246 --> 08:03.847
- Oh! I apologize...
- Ooh!

08:03.849 --> 08:05.415
Cheesy, creasy, so...

08:05.417 --> 08:06.919
Bumbly?

08:07.719 --> 08:08.951
No Bumbly here.

08:08.953 --> 08:11.388
No, it's Phil Philips, Larry's brother.
You remember me.

08:11.390 --> 08:15.725
No, I don't. I'm your average
puppet, minding his own business.

08:15.727 --> 08:17.893
All right, well, whatever
floats your boat, pal.

08:17.895 --> 08:19.862
Here's your
<i>Chicks With Big Asses.</i>

08:19.864 --> 08:21.163
Uh, that's not mine.

08:21.165 --> 08:23.133
I'm a businessman,
going to do my business,

08:23.135 --> 08:26.201
and I certainly don't have
a crippling addiction to porn.

08:26.203 --> 08:27.939
- That's not yours?
- No!

08:28.939 --> 08:30.674
Hey, you forgot your carrot.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.740
Not mine.

08:34.412 --> 08:36.746
Fucking rabbits.

08:36.748 --> 08:38.381
<i>Does that hurt?</i>

08:38.383 --> 08:39.815
<i>Yes.</i>

08:39.817 --> 08:42.051
<i>You came here
for pleasure!</i>

08:42.053 --> 08:44.420
<i>But I will only
give you pain!</i>

<i>Walk my dog.</i>

09:04.142 --> 09:07.010

09:07.012 --> 09:09.045
- <i>Do you want that?</i>
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

09:09.047 --> 09:10.313
Freaky-deaky.

09:10.315 --> 09:12.815
<i>You are a
disgusting fireman.</i>

09:12.817 --> 09:15.418
<i>Where is your dirty hose?</i>

09:15.420 --> 09:17.721
<i>Where is your filthy hose?</i>

Cheesy, creasy.

09:28.899 --> 09:31.767
Oh, God.
This is oddly arousing.

09:31.769 --> 09:32.937
Can't hold it.

09:34.339 --> 09:36.275
Freeze, punk.

09:43.348 --> 09:44.350
What the...

09:49.454 --> 09:52.856

Look who's here.

10:19.817 --> 10:23.386
Hey, why don't you sing
us a puppet song, sweetheart?

10:23.388 --> 10:26.289
Oh, yeah, I'd love to.
It goes a little like this.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.260
Fuck both of you.

10:28.826 --> 10:30.325
Okay? We clear?

10:30.327 --> 10:33.364
By the way, nobody really wears
their hat, you dumb rookie.

10:37.234 --> 10:38.267

- Jesus.

Oh, Philips.

10:45.411 --> 10:47.876
Figures you'd be in the
center of this shitstorm.

10:47.878 --> 10:50.445
Ah, okay. Hey, everybody,
it's Sherlock Holmes,

10:50.447 --> 10:51.814
world's greatest detective.

10:51.816 --> 10:53.583
Hey, it's a pair of socks.

10:53.585 --> 10:55.551
Very nice, very classy.

10:55.553 --> 10:57.120
I'm a witness, you asshole.

10:57.122 --> 10:58.453
- You wanna take it outside?
- Yeah.

10:58.455 --> 11:00.022
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- What's that?

11:00.024 --> 11:01.558
I'm gonna shred you
into little bitty pieces,

11:01.560 --> 11:04.294
- and I'm gonna put you inside a king-size pillowcase...
- Mmm-hmm.

11:04.296 --> 11:06.429
...and I'm gonna have the best
goddamn sleep of my life.

11:06.431 --> 11:08.430
Yeah. That's very clever,
that's very clever.

11:08.432 --> 11:10.433
Did you pick that outfit
out yourself? Huh?

11:10.435 --> 11:13.368
Yeah, I un-sewed your mother,
and I made a jacket out of her.

11:13.370 --> 11:15.939
Nice. What a delicate
little flower you are. Huh?

11:15.941 --> 11:17.006
Yeah, thank you.

What the hell is going on here?
Settle down.

Edwards.

11:30.088 --> 11:31.253
Yeah, it looks like
you, uh, got

11:31.255 --> 11:33.589
quite the little shotgun
murder on your hands here.

11:33.591 --> 11:36.192
They said you were in the back,
but didn't hear anything.

11:36.194 --> 11:37.626
That's not
the Phil Philips I know.

11:37.628 --> 11:42.064
Oh, well, uh, there was a porno
blaring, dogs barking, fire hoses,

11:42.066 --> 11:43.599
you don't wanna know, sir.

11:43.601 --> 11:44.968
No, I don't.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.205
Edwards, what do you see?

11:47.071 --> 11:48.404
Looks like a robbery
gone bad to me.

11:48.406 --> 11:51.140
Lieutenant, this wasn't
a robbery, this was a hit.

11:51.142 --> 11:52.407
What makes you think that?

11:52.409 --> 11:55.978
Well, because the robber
didn't take the money.

11:55.980 --> 11:58.146
Shitcakes.

11:58.148 --> 12:00.315
Lieutenant, uh,
the press is here.

12:00.317 --> 12:02.452
- Wonderful.
- Am I free to go, sir?

12:02.454 --> 12:03.420
- No.
- Yes.

12:03.422 --> 12:06.122
- Yes, you are free to go.
- No one asked you.

12:06.124 --> 12:07.957
No. Why would we let him go?

12:07.959 --> 12:09.958
It's none of your business
why I can go or not.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.627
It's up to him,
he's the lieutenant.

12:11.629 --> 12:12.795
You are free to go.

12:12.797 --> 12:15.631
You need to go out the back
while I talk to these cretins.

12:15.633 --> 12:19.301
The last thing this department needs
is for anyone to see you here.

12:19.303 --> 12:24.274
Yup, I'm still the department's
dirty little puppet secret, huh?

12:24.276 --> 12:26.608
- Well, if the shoe fits.
- Fuck you.

12:26.610 --> 12:27.977
Yeah, fuck you, too.

12:27.979 --> 12:29.248
Fuck you more.

12:30.514 --> 12:33.448
<i>You're watching
the Puppet Television Network.</i>

12:33.450 --> 12:35.318
It's Happytime!

12:35.320 --> 12:38.087
<i>Returning this fall,
that motley crew of misfits</i>

12:38.089 --> 12:40.290
<i>that entertained you
throughout the '90s.</i>

12:40.292 --> 12:44.493
<i>At home with Jenny, Coach
Lyle, Goofer the handyman,</i>

12:44.495 --> 12:48.631
<i>Mr. Bumblypants, and next-door
neighbors Ezra and Cara,</i>

12:48.633 --> 12:51.400
<i>and, of course, Officer Larry Shenanigans.</i>

12:51.402 --> 12:52.401
<i>Freeze!</i>

12:52.403 --> 12:55.671
<i>You are under arrest
for being too hot to handle.</i>

12:55.673 --> 12:58.341
<i>So, tune in for
the entire Happytime Gang,</i>

12:58.343 --> 13:00.346
<i>only on
the Puppet Television Network.</i>

13:01.146 --> 13:03.045
Syndication, baby brother.

13:03.047 --> 13:06.082
Oh, I am gonna make a killing on
those royalty checks.

13:06.084 --> 13:09.117
Looks like I'll finally be able
to pay off my Scientology dues.

13:09.119 --> 13:11.420
Yeah, too bad you can't
buy your old nose back.

13:11.422 --> 13:15.190
All right. This nose has been in
more fluff than you can imagine.

13:15.192 --> 13:18.461
So, uh, you're not concerned
with Bumblypants being killed?

13:18.463 --> 13:20.663
Bumbly would've wanted
to die in a porn shop.

13:20.665 --> 13:21.667
That was his heaven.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.103
- Excuse me.
- Hmm?

13:24.601 --> 13:26.336
Are you
Officer Shenanigans?

13:26.338 --> 13:30.039
Uh, does this answer
your question?

13:30.041 --> 13:32.541
Freeze! You are
under arrest for being

13:32.543 --> 13:34.977
- too hot to handle.
- Too hot to handle.

13:34.979 --> 13:37.045
- Oh, my gosh!
- You got it.

13:37.047 --> 13:40.449
Man, that is the greatest line
of all time.

13:40.451 --> 13:42.651
- Yeah.
- I loved your show when I was a kid.

13:42.653 --> 13:43.719
Ah.

13:43.721 --> 13:45.988
Are you a TV star, too?

13:45.990 --> 13:47.490
Uh, no. I have a real job.

13:47.492 --> 13:50.459
Ah, yeah, me, too.
I sell weed.

13:50.461 --> 13:52.395
Don't tell
Officer Shenanigans.

13:52.397 --> 13:55.164
- Uh-oh! Someone's gonna get arrested.
- Ah, don't do it.

13:55.166 --> 13:56.565
Jesus Christ.

13:56.567 --> 13:58.233
Hey, I'll stalk you later.
I want a selfie.

13:58.235 --> 13:59.736
- All right.
- Cool.

13:59.738 --> 14:02.070
What a...
What a sweetheart she was.

14:02.072 --> 14:04.107
Damn it, Phil, Jesus!

14:04.109 --> 14:05.242
Don't upset the fans.

14:05.244 --> 14:08.077
- Oh, those are your fans now, huh? Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:08.079 --> 14:09.746
Sure, the ones that like
that bleached skin

14:09.748 --> 14:11.247
and that human nose you got?

14:11.249 --> 14:14.684
You know what, Phil, <i>the Happytime
Gang</i> was groundbreaking. Okay?

14:14.686 --> 14:18.621
It was the first network show starring
puppets that was accepted by everyone.

14:18.623 --> 14:19.756
People loved us, Phil.

14:19.758 --> 14:23.492
Jeez, you don't have to deny
the puppet part of yourself.

14:23.494 --> 14:26.029
Phil, don't you remember
when we were kids, huh?

14:26.031 --> 14:27.666
I used to love
watching you dance.

14:28.532 --> 14:30.132
Who bent your boner?

14:30.134 --> 14:32.367
Take your head out of your ass
and look around.

14:32.369 --> 14:35.505
It's their world,
and we just live in it.

14:35.507 --> 14:38.174
- I know this is hard for you.
- What is?

14:38.176 --> 14:40.410
That I'm the one who's going
down in the history books.

14:40.412 --> 14:42.645
Both Philips bros don't need
to change the world.

14:42.647 --> 14:46.082
You gave it a shot with your
whole trying-to-be-a-cop thing.

14:46.084 --> 14:50.319
Hey. I was a cop,
and a damn good one.

14:50.321 --> 14:54.158
Yeah, Phil, you were the first
puppet cop and the last.

14:55.793 --> 14:57.162
Move on.

14:57.528 --> 14:59.127
Larry...

14:59.129 --> 15:00.295
- What?
- ...I love you.

15:00.297 --> 15:01.164
What? Where are you going?

15:01.166 --> 15:04.203
But sometimes,
you can be a real asshole.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.304
You know, it's funny
you should say that.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.604
I don't actually have my
real asshole anymore either.

15:11.142 --> 15:12.677
Oh, Phil, it's on again.

15:15.245 --> 15:18.247
Ah, what a wonderful surprise.

15:18.249 --> 15:20.149
What are you harassing me
for this time, Edwards?

15:20.151 --> 15:22.084
I just happen to like
the milkshakes here.

15:22.086 --> 15:23.553
Oh, yeah? How many a day
you up to now?

15:23.555 --> 15:25.655
Or uh, you're just hitting
the syrup, too?

15:25.657 --> 15:28.857
You got to stop moving through the world
like the laws don't apply to you.

15:28.859 --> 15:30.492
Excuse me, excuse me.

15:30.494 --> 15:31.828
You know what?

15:31.830 --> 15:34.362
It'd serve you well to remember
who the detective is around here.

15:34.364 --> 15:36.131
'Cause it ain't you,
Philips.

15:36.133 --> 15:37.433
Puppets aren't cops.

15:37.435 --> 15:39.301
Yeah, well, you saw
to that, didn't you?

15:39.303 --> 15:41.270
Oh, I think you got to
take the credit for that one.

15:41.272 --> 15:43.439
I mean, let's be honest,

15:43.441 --> 15:45.741
puppets just don't seem to be
able to handle themselves

15:45.743 --> 15:46.976
in extreme
pressure situations.

15:46.978 --> 15:50.112
You know what, stay out of my way
if you don't wanna get hurt.

15:50.114 --> 15:53.782
All right, but what
are you gonna do to me, huh?

15:53.784 --> 15:56.285
You know, one of these days,
you're gonna slip up,

15:56.287 --> 15:58.286
and I'm gonna be there
waiting for you, Phil.

15:58.288 --> 16:00.522
And I'm gonna take you down
with extreme prejudice.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.757
Well, nice choice
of words, asshole.

16:02.759 --> 16:04.526
You know what?

16:04.528 --> 16:07.262
What are you doing? What the
fuck are you doing to my car?

16:07.264 --> 16:08.764
Goddamn son of a bitch.

16:08.766 --> 16:10.399
Oh, I'm sorry,
it must've slipped.

16:13.604 --> 16:15.474
You're a goddamn menace!

16:38.729 --> 16:39.797
Some marksman.

16:44.735 --> 16:46.771
Oh, brother.

16:50.642 --> 16:53.442
"Puppet cops won't shoot
other puppets."

16:53.444 --> 16:55.243
What a bunch of bullshit.

16:56.281 --> 16:57.549
Yeah, come on in.

16:57.882 --> 16:59.314
Hey, boss.

16:59.316 --> 17:00.650
Hey, dear.

17:00.652 --> 17:04.520
I'm taking off. Do you
wanna get a drink?

17:04.521 --> 17:07.290
Uh, no,
I, uh, beat you to it.

17:08.626 --> 17:11.394
I'm just gonna sit here alone,
get nostalgic,

17:11.396 --> 17:13.499
and drink till I pass out.

17:14.365 --> 17:17.265
Don't waste your time, Mr. P.

17:17.267 --> 17:20.269
Most folks will never
understand puppets.

17:20.271 --> 17:22.538
No matter what they
look like on the outside,

17:22.540 --> 17:25.377
they're fluffy and good
on the inside.

17:26.778 --> 17:28.778
Not like people.

17:28.780 --> 17:30.646
You got a big heart, kid.

17:33.350 --> 17:34.719
Good night, Phil Philips.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.422
Good night, Bubbles.

17:43.461 --> 17:44.827
Here we go.

17:44.829 --> 17:46.395
Hey, you ready for this?

17:46.397 --> 17:49.699
It's <i>The Happytime Gang</i>
Season 4 wrap party.

17:49.701 --> 17:51.166
- Wow.
- I shot the video myself.

17:51.168 --> 17:56.239
<i>Hey, Larry coming to you live
with the party cam! Whoo-hoo!</i>

17:56.241 --> 17:59.341
Your skin was so blue
and puppety back then.

17:59.343 --> 18:00.476
You're way hotter now.

18:00.478 --> 18:03.511
Yeah, couple of felt tucks
and a quarter-cup of bleach...

18:03.513 --> 18:05.848
Here I am.

18:05.850 --> 18:08.717
<i>Let me see
you work it, Bumblypants.</i>

18:08.719 --> 18:10.786
<i>Ooh, Ezra and Cara.</i>

18:10.788 --> 18:12.588
Those two are cousins.

18:12.590 --> 18:14.456
- They're married with kids now.
- Ooh!

18:14.458 --> 18:16.759
<i>Goofer,
need a drink, buddy?</i>

18:16.761 --> 18:18.694
<i>No, I'm good.
Thanks, Lawrence.</i>

18:18.696 --> 18:19.895
- Goof!
- <i>Whoo!</i>

18:19.897 --> 18:21.763
<i>Liley, the Wildman!</i>

18:24.369 --> 18:25.600
<i>There's Jenny.</i>

18:25.602 --> 18:26.836
<i>All right, freeze.</i>

18:26.838 --> 18:28.738
<i>Oh, here comes
my brother with his partner.</i>

18:28.740 --> 18:30.240
<i>Freeze, police!</i>

18:30.242 --> 18:33.809
<i>We've had a lot of complaints
regarding this party.</i>

18:33.811 --> 18:37.012
<i>That there's
not enough tequila!</i>

18:38.882 --> 18:40.782
Phil used to be
so much fun.

18:40.784 --> 18:43.019
- <i>Hey, babe, you made it.</i>
- <i>I'm off duty.</i>

18:43.021 --> 18:45.754
<i>Let's party all night.</i>

18:45.756 --> 18:49.024
Hey, why don't you go and mix us up
a fresh batch of margaritas, huh?

18:49.026 --> 18:50.595
Oh, sure thing.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.433
Mmm-hmm!

18:55.065 --> 18:57.465
Yeah.

18:57.467 --> 18:58.834
I like your robe.

18:58.836 --> 19:00.001
You like that?

19:00.003 --> 19:01.907
Yeah, that blue
matches my pubes.

19:09.946 --> 19:11.312
Hey, Britty,

19:11.314 --> 19:15.717
hurry back 'cause this hot tub is
too hot to handle without you.

19:15.719 --> 19:16.821
Coming.

19:27.331 --> 19:28.998
Hmm?

19:44.482 --> 19:48.084
Bad dogs! Bad dogs!

19:50.888 --> 19:53.989
They were
such bad, bad dogs.

19:53.991 --> 19:56.791
Larry! Get out of my way.
Get out of my way!

19:56.793 --> 19:59.395
Where is he?
I said get out of my way!

19:59.397 --> 20:01.830
Phil, this isn't how
you wanna remember Larry.

20:01.832 --> 20:02.866
Just gotta see him.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.070
Lieutenant, I think I found
the murder weapon.

20:05.802 --> 20:06.702
That fucking dog!

20:06.704 --> 20:08.840
- Get the dog out of here.
- Okay, I'm sorry!

20:13.110 --> 20:14.713
<i>Jesuchristo.</i>

20:16.013 --> 20:19.714
Looks like someone had themselves
a real pinata party, huh?

20:19.716 --> 20:21.117
- Son of a...
- Hey, now.

20:27.925 --> 20:29.157
Knock it off, you two.

20:29.159 --> 20:31.463
Aah! Get your teeth
out of my tit!

20:34.898 --> 20:36.965
Ooh!

20:36.967 --> 20:38.570
You bit my dick!

20:41.472 --> 20:44.740
You two need to start
behaving like goddamn adults.

20:44.742 --> 20:46.442
I'm sorry.

20:46.444 --> 20:48.476
I didn't recognize
that it was Larry.

20:48.478 --> 20:51.579
I mean, he used to be,
you know, a lot bluer.

20:51.581 --> 20:52.882
I don't know
if that's PC to say.

20:52.884 --> 20:55.017
What is that supposed to mean,
"a lot bluer"?

20:55.019 --> 20:56.184
It means he was bluer before.

20:56.186 --> 20:58.620
I don't know how else to say...
I can't say "blue"?

20:58.622 --> 20:59.621
Fucking racist.

20:59.623 --> 21:00.690
There was a time
when you two were

21:00.692 --> 21:03.492
the most decorated officers
in this department.

21:03.494 --> 21:06.028
Your clearance rates
were double anybody else's.

21:06.030 --> 21:07.463
What you had was magic.

21:07.465 --> 21:10.965
Just like when that motherfucker David
Copperfield makes it snow inside.

21:10.967 --> 21:12.667
That's not even
that good of a trick.

21:12.669 --> 21:14.770
It's, like, two mirrors and
a laser, and I can do that.

21:14.772 --> 21:16.137
What are you,
fucking Houdini now?

21:16.139 --> 21:18.507
- Maybe I am Houdini.
- I'd like to see you disappear.

21:18.509 --> 21:19.541
Stop it!

21:19.543 --> 21:21.112
You're gonna work
together on this.

21:21.812 --> 21:22.912
Excuse me, what?

21:22.914 --> 21:24.280
Oh, come on,

21:24.282 --> 21:27.683
this jackwad is the reason that
puppets can't be cops anymore.

21:27.685 --> 21:28.983
He missed
on purpose that day.

21:28.985 --> 21:30.051
Not true.

21:30.053 --> 21:31.319
Everybody knows
puppets don't shoot puppets.

21:31.321 --> 21:35.957
The Philips Code prohibits me from
having a puppet as a partner.

21:35.959 --> 21:38.594
- That's true. I'm Philips.
- He's the Philips.

21:38.596 --> 21:40.596
They hated him so much,
they made a code about him.

21:40.598 --> 21:42.598
I'm not reinstating him
as a police officer,

21:42.600 --> 21:43.899
I'm bringing him on
as a consultant.

21:43.901 --> 21:47.203
No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not
working with this asshole.

21:47.205 --> 21:48.271
Well, right back at you.

21:48.273 --> 21:51.005
You wanna cry about it?
I'll park you behind a desk.

21:51.007 --> 21:54.009
You don't cooperate, and I'll
bite you in the dick, too.

21:54.011 --> 21:58.813
Look, Lieutenant, nobody turns my brother
into a chew toy and gets away with it.

21:58.815 --> 22:01.752
I'm gonna catch the bastards
who did these murders.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.052
Murders?

22:04.054 --> 22:06.821
I mean, no offense, I don't
wanna start anything,

22:06.823 --> 22:09.825
but, what, did I miss
another body around here?

22:09.827 --> 22:13.495
No, whoever killed Larry
also took out Mr. Bumblypants.

22:13.497 --> 22:16.098
Bumblypants was
the target there.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.634
What's the connection?

22:18.636 --> 22:20.172
- <i>The Happytime Gang.</i>
- <i>The Happytime Gang.</i>

22:24.208 --> 22:26.541
<i>I hated the idea of having
to work with a partner again,</i>

22:26.543 --> 22:28.277
<i>but I owed it to Larry.</i>

22:28.279 --> 22:30.812
<i>He was my brother and, deep down,
I loved the dumb son of a bitch.</i>

22:30.814 --> 22:32.982
What do you know
about this Ronovan Scargle?

22:32.984 --> 22:34.983
He produced
<i>The Happytime Gang,</i>

22:34.985 --> 22:37.919
and he's your typical shyster,
meat sack piece of shit.

22:37.921 --> 22:41.790
Can you roll down the window, for Christ's sake?

22:43.860 --> 22:47.730
Okay. Well, you
know what, do you mind?

22:47.732 --> 22:50.265
You don't mind if I have one
of your cigarettes, do you?

22:50.267 --> 22:53.838
- No, go ahead.
- You know what, I'm gonna take two.

22:56.873 --> 22:59.607
Now, we're... Now,
we're having a good time.

22:59.609 --> 23:01.010
Isn't it nice
just to relax?

23:01.012 --> 23:04.115
It's delicious, it's like
springtime in Beijing.

23:08.185 --> 23:11.553
We just wanna thank you for taking
the time to speak with us today.

23:11.555 --> 23:15.624
Well, I'm always happy to indulge
our local law enforcement,

23:15.626 --> 23:18.626
no matter how masculine
and unkempt they are.

23:18.628 --> 23:20.930
Ah, well, I didn't think
I was unkempt.

23:20.932 --> 23:23.735
No, no, you're the masculine,
he's the unkempt.

23:24.601 --> 23:26.068
Oh.

23:26.070 --> 23:30.905
Okay. We will just stick
to, uh, some questions, okay?

23:30.907 --> 23:33.975
Now, do you have any idea
why someone may want to murder

23:33.977 --> 23:36.845
Augustus Bumblypants
or Larry Shenanigans?

23:36.847 --> 23:38.347
It's a tragedy, what happened.

23:38.349 --> 23:41.649
I gave your brother and Augustus
Bumblypants their start.

23:41.651 --> 23:45.354
Yeah, you also gave him a bullshit
deal where your cut was 60%.

23:45.356 --> 23:48.723
- Hey.
- That is standard operating procedure.

23:48.725 --> 23:49.825
Puppets are dumb.

23:51.128 --> 23:52.828
Fucking dick.

23:52.830 --> 23:55.931
Well, we would like to, uh, take a look at
that contract for the syndication deal.

23:55.933 --> 23:58.099
Well, I'm afraid
that's private information.

23:58.101 --> 24:01.002
And who would care about a puppet's
share in a contract anyway, right?

24:01.004 --> 24:05.340
I mean, all those little dummies want to
do is sing and dance, am I right?

24:05.342 --> 24:06.942
What did you say, "dummies"?

24:06.944 --> 24:08.077
- Yeah, that is right.
- Mmm-hmm.

24:08.079 --> 24:10.945
When you're right, you're right.

24:10.947 --> 24:14.316
- I can't help noticing this impressive view.
- Oh.

24:14.318 --> 24:15.917
For an impressive man.

24:15.919 --> 24:17.153
Thank you very much.

24:17.155 --> 24:20.623
I don't take compliments well,
but I get them all the time.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.024
That's charming.

24:23.026 --> 24:26.228
Listen, you and I both know that these
puppets wouldn't know a good deal

24:26.230 --> 24:28.696
if it was staring them
right in the googly eyes.

24:28.698 --> 24:30.031
What the fuck
did you just say?

24:30.033 --> 24:35.169
Hey, Phil, why don't you let the
grown-ups talk for a minute, okay?

24:35.171 --> 24:36.171
Fuck.

24:36.173 --> 24:38.107
Don't worry, he retains
very little information.

24:38.109 --> 24:41.342
Oh, my God, is that
the ocean over there?

24:41.344 --> 24:42.978
Yep, that's the Pacific.

24:42.980 --> 24:44.512
I had to lobby for two years

24:44.514 --> 24:48.282
to get that children's hospital cleared
to make that ocean view possible.

24:48.284 --> 24:49.617
Wow. Here's the thing,

24:49.619 --> 24:53.088
you and I both know that this
is like puppet bullshit here,

24:53.090 --> 24:57.291
but I'm just afraid this asshole
is gonna make me pull a warrant.

24:57.293 --> 24:58.860
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:58.862 --> 24:59.994
What are these here?

24:59.996 --> 25:01.363
Please,
don't touch my balls.

25:01.365 --> 25:02.598
They're made
of Tibetan marble.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.799
- They're very expensive.
- Don't touch his balls.

25:04.801 --> 25:07.304
Ah, I apologize, I didn't
mean to cup your balls.

25:09.073 --> 25:11.042
Down there. What, do
you have alligator arms? Get it!

25:12.142 --> 25:13.744
Okay, here's the thing.

25:14.678 --> 25:17.146
You seem great,

25:17.148 --> 25:19.380
and I don't wanna have to call
a judge on you, you know,

25:19.382 --> 25:20.816
'cause you know that mess.

25:20.818 --> 25:23.418
But little puppets
have big mouths, right?

25:23.420 --> 25:25.053
Mmm. I have puppet
servants at home,

25:25.055 --> 25:27.755
and they get real uppity if
I don't keep them in line.

25:30.394 --> 25:32.694
Holy shitcakes!

25:32.696 --> 25:34.129
- Have you lost your mind?
- Fuck him.

25:34.131 --> 25:37.067
How else was I supposed to get that
fucking thing without him seeing it?

25:38.099 --> 25:39.334
Literally any other way
than what you just did.

25:39.336 --> 25:40.702
Any other way.

25:40.704 --> 25:43.808
Oh, yeah? I never knocked a guy
out with his own balls before.

25:46.176 --> 25:47.876
<i>According to the contract,</i>

25:47.878 --> 25:51.012
The Happytime Gang <i>TV show is about
to be sold into syndication.</i>

25:51.014 --> 25:54.015
"The seven principal
<i>Happytime Gang</i> cast members

25:54.017 --> 25:56.784
"are guaranteed to split
the $10 million up front."

25:56.786 --> 25:58.453
- $10 million?
- Right.

25:58.455 --> 26:03.325
Now, "If a member dies, then his
or her spouse gets the share.

26:03.327 --> 26:04.827
"If there is no spouse,

26:04.829 --> 26:09.130
"then the share is divided equally among
the remaining living cast members."

26:09.132 --> 26:11.799
Hmm. So, Ronovan really doesn't
benefit if the cast shrinks.

26:11.801 --> 26:14.403
Yeah, I guess I didn't have to
knock him out with his own balls.

26:14.405 --> 26:17.806
Yeah, well, somebody from
inside The Happytime Gang

26:17.808 --> 26:19.273
is looking for
a bigger piece of the pie.

26:19.275 --> 26:22.845
Yeah, and they're not gonna stop until
they're the only one left standing.

26:22.847 --> 26:24.512
At least then we'd know
who the killer is.

26:24.514 --> 26:26.080
All right, just slow down,

26:26.082 --> 26:27.482
here comes the street up here.

26:27.484 --> 26:29.284
<i>To find the killer,</i>

26:29.286 --> 26:32.221
<i>we needed to look into the remaining
Happytime Gang members one by one.</i>

26:32.223 --> 26:35.223
<i>We started down on Skidder
Row, the Stuffing Ghetto,</i>

26:35.225 --> 26:37.925
<i>where the sugar is cheap
and the sex is cheaper.</i>

26:37.927 --> 26:38.993
Looks like, uh,

26:38.995 --> 26:41.963
Coach Lyle's got himself
a bit of a criminal record.

26:41.965 --> 26:44.066
You know, back in
<i>The Happytime Gang</i> days,

26:44.068 --> 26:45.233
Lyle was as straight
as an arrow.

26:45.235 --> 26:47.970
Well, looks like
his arrow got bent.

26:47.972 --> 26:49.405
This is it.

26:49.407 --> 26:52.774
Okay, can we please just be
professional and keep a low profile?

26:52.776 --> 26:54.009
Of course.

26:59.282 --> 27:00.549
Hey, look, it's the NRA.

27:00.551 --> 27:01.884
Get in here.

27:01.886 --> 27:03.484
Okay, all right. Take it easy.

27:03.486 --> 27:04.386
- Take it easy.
- Come here, you.

27:04.388 --> 27:07.388
- Come on.
- All right, all right, all right.

27:07.390 --> 27:10.424
Phil Philips, what a surprise.
It's been a while.

27:10.426 --> 27:11.326
Hey, Lyle.

27:11.328 --> 27:13.561
I hate to be
the bearer of bad news,

27:13.563 --> 27:15.931
but we don't allow
humans in our game.

27:15.933 --> 27:17.933
Oh, no, no, no, wait,
you don't understand.

27:17.935 --> 27:20.301
- She's not all human.
- Shut up, Phil.

27:20.303 --> 27:22.104
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

27:22.106 --> 27:23.475
Edwards, tell them.

27:25.141 --> 27:27.341
Fine, I have
a puppet liver.

27:27.343 --> 27:30.078
Wow.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.013
- Bullshit. Prove it.
- No way.

27:32.015 --> 27:33.147
Bring her ass over here.

27:33.149 --> 27:34.515
What are you gonna do?
Cut me open?

27:34.517 --> 27:36.117
- Roxy?
- Yeah.

27:36.119 --> 27:38.553
Look at this,
Sacramento Red Hot.

27:38.555 --> 27:40.388
Grade-A hyper sucrose.

27:40.390 --> 27:43.559
It'll put a human in a
diabetic coma for a month,

27:43.561 --> 27:46.461
but to a puppet,
pure ecstasy.

27:46.463 --> 27:47.596
I'm not doing that.

27:47.598 --> 27:49.934
Do it, meat sack,
take it.

28:03.313 --> 28:06.917
Oh, sorry about your
dead human friend, Philips.

28:07.451 --> 28:08.486
Wait for it.

28:10.486 --> 28:12.386
Whoo!

28:13.858 --> 28:14.923
That is good shit.

28:14.925 --> 28:16.424
Well, fuck me.

28:16.426 --> 28:18.260
Maybe.

28:18.262 --> 28:21.062
She said she might.
Ha-ha. That's funny!

28:23.567 --> 28:25.867
Shit, this woman crazy.

28:27.404 --> 28:29.605
Somebody get more of this!

28:29.607 --> 28:30.638
- Boy, that's great!
- Whoo!

28:30.640 --> 28:32.307
Hey, wait a minute, now.

28:32.309 --> 28:33.942
Hey, put that...
No, don't do that.

28:37.982 --> 28:39.548
We're laughing together.

28:39.550 --> 28:41.085
You're my favorite.

28:44.888 --> 28:46.187
Half-puppet cop?

28:46.189 --> 28:47.623
Never heard of that before.

28:47.625 --> 28:49.523
Yeah, tell me about it.

28:49.525 --> 28:52.961
Hey, listen, I need to ask you a
few questions, if you don't mind.

28:52.963 --> 28:54.096
Oh, sure, sure.

28:54.098 --> 28:56.464
Listen, I'm sorry
about Larry, man.

28:56.466 --> 28:59.967
He was all right,
even after the bleach job.

28:59.969 --> 29:01.369
Yeah, thanks.

29:01.371 --> 29:04.205
You know, most fleshies don't
give a fuck when one of us drops.

29:04.207 --> 29:06.107
That doesn't make it okay.

29:06.109 --> 29:08.175
You're absolutely right.

29:08.177 --> 29:09.546
Here's to Larry, man.

29:11.514 --> 29:13.147
To Larry.

29:13.149 --> 29:17.118
Yeah, ashes to ashes,
and fluff to fluff, man.

29:17.120 --> 29:20.121
Flush to
the motherfucking queen.

29:20.123 --> 29:22.924
Eat it so much, bitch.

29:25.396 --> 29:27.529
I'd love
to eat it so much,

29:27.531 --> 29:29.364
but I have a sensitive tummy,

29:29.366 --> 29:34.269
which may be because I got a full
boat, you Kremlin piece of shit.

29:35.071 --> 29:36.938
Oh, it's okay, babe...

29:39.310 --> 29:41.242
Get me some more lean.

29:41.244 --> 29:44.248
- Okay.
- Motherfucking bitch.

29:46.015 --> 29:50.051
I just never really cared for
that word, if you must know.

29:50.053 --> 29:53.488
You're one crazy
fucking bitch.

29:53.490 --> 29:55.022
Bitches be crazy.

29:55.024 --> 29:56.290
"Bitches be crazy," right?

29:56.292 --> 29:58.460
Am I right?
I mean, that guy knows.

29:58.462 --> 30:02.164
Yeah, you're really nailing
my views on women.

30:02.166 --> 30:05.032
Right, and we know.
Women... Women love you?

30:05.034 --> 30:06.667
They do not. They decline.

30:06.669 --> 30:09.037
Here's the thing, though.

30:09.039 --> 30:11.173
Would a crazy fucking
bitch do this?

30:11.175 --> 30:12.441
Wasteful.

30:12.443 --> 30:15.077
Maybe, but a crazy bitch
would do this.

30:19.750 --> 30:21.119
Peekaboo.

30:34.430 --> 30:36.598
How about
you apologize to Roxy

30:36.600 --> 30:41.638
and all the other fine ladies here
tonight for your disparaging remarks?

30:42.438 --> 30:44.074
Yeah, Junkyard.

30:44.507 --> 30:47.209
I'm sorry, bitches.

30:47.211 --> 30:50.078
Uh-uh-uh. Better tone,
same shitty words.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.381
Let's try it again.

30:52.116 --> 30:55.320
I'm sorry, beautiful ladies.

30:56.686 --> 30:58.086
Oh!

30:58.088 --> 30:59.724
How does that feel, Roxy?

31:00.357 --> 31:01.255
Better.

31:01.257 --> 31:03.157
I... I feel better.

31:03.159 --> 31:04.760
- Oh, you feel better, too?
- Mmm.

31:04.762 --> 31:06.794
Oh. Not really our goal.

31:06.796 --> 31:08.763
Get a diaper
for your fucking mouth.

31:08.765 --> 31:11.265
Yes.

31:11.267 --> 31:12.768
You're gonna
feel that tomorrow.

31:12.770 --> 31:15.239
Oh.

31:17.373 --> 31:18.874
I hope you don't
mind me asking,

31:18.876 --> 31:21.276
but, uh, what the hell happened
to all your <i>Happytime</i> money?

31:21.278 --> 31:23.511
Shit. After Loretta
and the kids left,

31:23.513 --> 31:26.815
I blew all that cream on
panty-pie and poody-glitter.

31:26.817 --> 31:29.216
Jeez, I'm sorry
to hear that.

31:29.218 --> 31:30.284
You know where you're going?

31:30.286 --> 31:32.253
Right up my snoot.

31:32.255 --> 31:34.222
That's where you...
You're gonna go.

31:34.224 --> 31:38.128
"Where are we going? Where
will we live?" In my nose.

31:40.230 --> 31:43.267
Hey, uh, who're your friends?

31:44.534 --> 31:46.367
Gonna scope it out.

31:46.369 --> 31:47.769
Lyle, stay. Don't get...

31:47.771 --> 31:49.070
Jesus Christ.

31:49.072 --> 31:50.507
This is not a good idea.

31:51.175 --> 31:52.808
You see anything?

31:52.810 --> 31:54.376
They're not friends of mine.

31:54.378 --> 31:56.144
Oh, shit! Lyle!

31:58.148 --> 31:59.417
Whoo!

32:02.519 --> 32:03.521
Holy...

32:03.853 --> 32:05.153
Ow!

32:09.259 --> 32:10.528
All right...

32:11.128 --> 32:12.530
Son of a bitch.

32:17.134 --> 32:18.403
LAPD!

32:20.704 --> 32:22.369
Where the fuck were you?

32:22.371 --> 32:24.438
- I was in the can.
- Doing what?

32:24.440 --> 32:25.840
Can stuff.

32:25.842 --> 32:27.675
Jesus Christ.

32:27.677 --> 32:30.744
Here comes the lieutenant. Just hold your shit together.

32:30.746 --> 32:33.447
Okay. I am. I have my shit held together.

32:33.449 --> 32:34.950
What the hell happened here?

32:34.952 --> 32:38.752
Well, somebody was trying to make it
look like an old-school drive-by.

32:38.754 --> 32:40.221
Look, Lieutenant,

32:40.223 --> 32:44.428
this makes three <i>Happytime Gang</i>
cast members dead in a week.

32:45.696 --> 32:47.598
May I say something now?

32:48.898 --> 32:50.165
Please, go. What?

32:50.167 --> 32:51.599
I'd also like
to point out that

32:51.601 --> 32:54.269
that makes three <i>Happytime</i> cast
members dead within the week.

32:54.271 --> 32:55.337
I just said that.

32:55.339 --> 32:56.738
You both just said it.

32:56.740 --> 32:59.140
Well, then we're fighting
on the same side.

32:59.142 --> 33:01.842
It's like we're
Apache-Comanche together,

33:01.844 --> 33:06.481
and no one, no one is coming
in with the suit jackets made

33:06.483 --> 33:08.250
and taking over
their land.

33:08.252 --> 33:09.384
What're you
talking about?

33:09.386 --> 33:10.886
I'm talking about Apaches.

33:10.888 --> 33:13.320
Apaches? What?
What did you say?

33:13.322 --> 33:14.789
We owe them.

33:14.791 --> 33:18.260
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

33:18.262 --> 33:20.361
Can we just stick to
what's going on here, please?

33:20.363 --> 33:21.730
- I'd love to. I'd love to.
- Okay.

33:21.732 --> 33:22.897
What's your deal, Edwards?

33:22.899 --> 33:24.899
My deal? I'm a Virgo,

33:24.901 --> 33:28.369
I'm not currently seeing
anybody, but I'm hopeful.

33:28.371 --> 33:29.704
Not the dating game.

33:29.706 --> 33:31.639
She's got a little cold.
She's taking medication, right?

33:31.641 --> 33:34.276
For the cold. So, she gets a little loopy.

33:34.278 --> 33:36.645
- Aw, I am getting a little loopy.
- Stop it.

33:36.647 --> 33:38.646
- Back to this.
- Yeah. Thank you.

33:38.648 --> 33:40.115
So, what're we gonna do,
Lieutenant?

33:40.117 --> 33:44.386
I can put a black and white on Jenny,
but Ezra and Cara live in Lancaster.

33:44.388 --> 33:45.654
That's out of my jurisdiction.

33:45.656 --> 33:47.722
And nobody even knows
where Goofer is.

33:47.724 --> 33:51.326
Reportedly, he was last sighted
somewhere near the Santa Monica Pier.

33:51.328 --> 33:53.360
Also, I have also noted that

33:53.362 --> 33:57.933
that's three <i>Happytime</i> cast members
that have been killed in one week.

33:57.935 --> 33:59.604
What the fuck?

34:01.205 --> 34:02.471
<i>The next morning,
we decided it'd be smarter</i>

34:02.473 --> 34:06.441
<i>if we quit holding each other's
proverbial dicks and split up.</i>

34:06.443 --> 34:08.476
<i>Edwards headed out to the
beach to look for Goofer,</i>

34:08.478 --> 34:10.579
<i>and I stopped by the office
to check in.</i>

34:10.581 --> 34:12.780
- Hey, Mr. P.
- Heya, Bubbles.

34:12.782 --> 34:13.614
Any calls?

34:13.616 --> 34:15.983
No, but Sandra White
is in your office.

34:15.985 --> 34:19.489
Oh, shit. I completely
forgot about that.

34:21.692 --> 34:22.958
<i>There she was.</i>

34:22.960 --> 34:24.726
<i>Her hair red like fire.</i>

34:24.728 --> 34:26.898
<i>Her ass hot like fire.</i>

34:28.565 --> 34:29.634
Ms. White.

34:31.435 --> 34:34.969
Mr. Philips, the blackmailer
sent another note.

34:34.971 --> 34:36.739
There's a photo this time.

34:39.442 --> 34:40.741
<i>Jenny Peterson.</i>

34:40.743 --> 34:41.842
<i>Of course I knew her.</i>

34:41.844 --> 34:43.712
<i>The one human member
of The Happytime Gang</i>

34:43.714 --> 34:45.512
<i>and a sexy skeleton
in my closet.</i>

34:45.514 --> 34:46.982
It was taken
at a place called...

34:46.984 --> 34:48.416
Star Showgirls.

34:48.418 --> 34:49.820
I recognize the pole.

34:51.321 --> 34:53.688
I sometimes enjoy
the company of a lady.

34:53.690 --> 34:54.922
Hell, who doesn't?

34:54.924 --> 34:56.023
Um...

34:56.025 --> 34:59.728
Can you think of anyone
who could be behind this?

34:59.730 --> 35:01.632
That's just the thing...

35:03.766 --> 35:06.000
I have quite an appetite.

35:07.270 --> 35:08.672
You seem shocked.

35:09.873 --> 35:11.676
Have I made you uncomfortable?

35:12.643 --> 35:14.009
A little.

35:14.011 --> 35:15.813
I have something for that.

35:16.813 --> 35:19.447
Hey, hey. Hey, what's
gotten into you?

35:19.449 --> 35:21.382
I'm hoping you.

35:21.384 --> 35:22.683
Okay. Okay. Okay.

35:22.685 --> 35:24.552
There's a little voice
in my head

35:24.554 --> 35:26.554
that is saying,
"This is not a good idea."

35:26.556 --> 35:28.690
Tell it to shut up
and watch.

35:34.864 --> 35:36.633
What's it going to be, Phil?

35:44.007 --> 35:45.407
- Yeah!
- Yes!

35:47.476 --> 35:48.643
Oh, hello.

35:48.645 --> 35:50.911
Lieutenant Banning, police.

35:50.913 --> 35:52.913
Bubbles, secretary.

35:52.915 --> 35:54.382
Is Phil in?

35:55.918 --> 35:58.320
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.020
Well, he's in something.

36:00.022 --> 36:01.322
Here comes the choo-choo!

36:01.324 --> 36:02.456
Yeah, choo-choo.

36:02.458 --> 36:03.958
Yeah.
I'm a freight train.

36:03.960 --> 36:07.329
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
- <i>I'm a caboose, baby.</i>

36:07.331 --> 36:08.329
Oh, boy.

36:10.100 --> 36:13.434
He's servicing a client right now.
Can I get you a coffee?

36:13.436 --> 36:15.337
- Yes!
- Faster, faster, faster!

36:15.339 --> 36:16.404
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

36:16.406 --> 36:17.771
Is that what I think it is?

36:19.109 --> 36:20.942
Well,
what do you think it is?

36:23.746 --> 36:27.081
- Here I go. Here I go. Here I go.
- Give it to me.

36:31.487 --> 36:34.088
Oh, baby. Oh, my.

36:38.728 --> 36:41.429
Yeah! Yeah!

36:45.768 --> 36:48.469
Okay. I'm lightheaded,
I'm lightheaded.

36:48.471 --> 36:50.438
Oh, my.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.574
Yes.

36:57.947 --> 37:00.114
Oh, yes. Yes.

37:00.116 --> 37:02.919
Whoa!

37:05.755 --> 37:07.991
You boys want
some Fiddle Faddle?

37:08.592 --> 37:11.028
No, I do not.

37:15.598 --> 37:17.567
Clean up on Aisle Phil.

37:18.735 --> 37:21.772
Hope your meeting
is as satisfying as mine was.

37:22.906 --> 37:24.005
Have a nice day.

37:24.007 --> 37:27.409
Wait, wait, wait. Wait for...
Wait for... Wait...

37:27.411 --> 37:29.777
Oh, hey. Hey, Lieutenant.

37:29.779 --> 37:30.677
Hey, Phil.

37:30.679 --> 37:32.614
Uh, who's your friend?

37:32.616 --> 37:35.150
- Special Agent Campbell, FBI.
- What a pleasure.

37:35.152 --> 37:38.152
We need to discuss where you
were when the murders went down.

37:38.154 --> 37:39.487
All right. Let me, uh...

37:39.489 --> 37:42.525
How about you come with us so
we can ask you some questions?

37:43.759 --> 37:45.763
That's fine, let me
just tidy up for a sec.

37:46.096 --> 37:47.130
Excuse me.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.473
- Shit!
- God damn it!

37:58.475 --> 38:00.875
I want an APB
out on that sock now!

38:00.877 --> 38:03.147
- Agent Campbell...
- This is out of your hands.

38:09.518 --> 38:11.755
You just got a little
something on your arm.

38:17.694 --> 38:19.726
- Have you seen this guy?
- No.

38:19.728 --> 38:21.195
- Anything?
- No.

38:21.197 --> 38:22.699
See this guy?

38:24.000 --> 38:25.603
Have you seen this guy?

38:27.136 --> 38:28.203
See this guy?

38:28.205 --> 38:29.204
How're you doing?

38:29.206 --> 38:31.806
Uh, I'm looking for this guy.
Have you seen him?

38:31.808 --> 38:34.875
I sense that
you are searching.

38:34.877 --> 38:36.677
Yeah, I just told you
I was looking for a guy,

38:36.679 --> 38:39.079
so you knowing that
does not mean you're psychic,

38:39.081 --> 38:40.047
it means you can hear me.

38:40.049 --> 38:41.849
Just tell me, yes or no.
Have you seen him?

38:41.851 --> 38:43.617
No. I ain't seen him.

38:43.619 --> 38:45.219
Now, fuck off.
You're bad for business.

38:45.221 --> 38:46.554
Yeah, go fuck yourself.

38:46.556 --> 38:48.159
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you, too.

38:49.893 --> 38:51.826
Hey, man. Have you
seen this puppet?

38:51.828 --> 38:52.994
Hmm.

38:52.996 --> 38:54.061
You know, I think he...

38:54.063 --> 38:55.195
- Jacob, we don't talk to meat sacks.
- Jesus Christ.

38:55.197 --> 38:57.599
- Oh, yeah, what Chuck said.
- Ooh! Show us your titties.

38:57.601 --> 38:58.800
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, come on.

38:58.802 --> 39:00.835
That can't actually be
your shtick with women.

39:00.837 --> 39:03.070
That has never worked
for you, am I right?

39:03.072 --> 39:04.538
- Sure it does.
- Never.

39:04.540 --> 39:05.739
- It does.
- Doesn't.

39:05.741 --> 39:06.974
- Once.
- I doubt that.

39:06.976 --> 39:08.076
I doubt that
very much for you.

39:08.078 --> 39:10.744
Come on, baby, I can tell
you've had crabs before.

39:10.746 --> 39:11.913
- Here, come on...
- I told you...

39:11.915 --> 39:14.849
- Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!
- I warned you.

39:14.851 --> 39:16.550
Oh, yeah, she wants me.

39:16.552 --> 39:17.652
Okay, all right.

39:17.654 --> 39:18.954
Have you seen this puppet?

39:18.956 --> 39:20.954
All's I know is, is
that he's a real sugar smack,

39:20.956 --> 39:23.291
and he's probably holed up
in that sugar den

39:23.293 --> 39:25.192
over on San Julian Street.

39:25.194 --> 39:27.262
Thank you. Jesus Christ.

39:27.264 --> 39:28.596
Gotta work for that...

39:28.598 --> 39:31.866
Oh... No!
You don't... Ow!

39:31.868 --> 39:33.902
If you're gonna eat it,
you don't get it.

39:33.904 --> 39:34.969
I'm hungry.

39:34.971 --> 39:37.938
Well, you should've bought
20 bucks of food, dumbass.

39:37.940 --> 39:39.840
<i>I knew if the feds
had me in the slammer,</i>

39:39.842 --> 39:41.342
<i>there's no way I could find
the real killer.</i>

39:41.344 --> 39:44.579
<i>Most of all, I wanted to
protect my old flame, Jenny.</i>

39:44.581 --> 39:46.748
<i>I still had
a soft spot for her.</i>

39:46.750 --> 39:48.750
<i>Hell, I still had
a hard spot for her.</i>

39:48.752 --> 39:50.217
<i>All units be advised.</i>

39:50.219 --> 39:52.820
<i>Be on the lookout for
ex-puppet cop Phil Philips.</i>

39:52.822 --> 39:54.721
<i>Blue male,
three and a half feet tall.</i>

39:54.723 --> 39:57.592
<i>Last seen fleeing on foot
from 1643...</i>

39:57.594 --> 39:59.192
Oh, boy.

39:59.194 --> 40:01.195
Her makeup is so tasteful.

40:01.197 --> 40:02.764
- Oh, look at that.
- Oh, wow.

40:02.766 --> 40:04.933
- Yeah, twirl, baby.
- Whoo! Yes.

40:04.935 --> 40:05.867
Yes. Carousel.

40:05.869 --> 40:08.603
- This is arousing my Peter Rabbit.
- Yes.

40:08.605 --> 40:10.270
She's got her hands
on my carrot.

40:10.272 --> 40:13.308
Give me the carrot. Give me the carrot.
Is this the carrot?

40:13.310 --> 40:16.143
We are not in the briar
patch anymore, boys. Whoo!

40:16.980 --> 40:19.047
You want
some carrot, huh?

40:19.049 --> 40:21.849
Oh, yeah. Give it to us.
Give it to us.

40:21.851 --> 40:23.250
- Make it rain!
- Peel on me.

40:23.252 --> 40:25.920
- It feels like Easter in my pants.
- Ahh...

40:25.922 --> 40:28.723
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do it, do it.
- Bite the tip!

40:33.362 --> 40:35.797
<i>Jenny,
the one that got away.</i>

40:35.799 --> 40:38.666
<i>As you can see, she's the kind
of girl you take home to momma.</i>

40:38.668 --> 40:41.001
I just made
carrot soup.

40:41.003 --> 40:44.639
Well, hello. I didn't think you
were coming around here no more.

40:44.641 --> 40:46.674
We need to talk.

40:46.676 --> 40:48.078
Okay. Give me a minute.

40:50.145 --> 40:51.512
I don't know her.

40:51.514 --> 40:54.014
I can't remember every puppet
comes in here to get a freak on.

40:54.016 --> 40:56.717
All right, fair enough.

41:00.824 --> 41:03.791
What is it
with this casual attitude?

41:03.793 --> 41:04.992
Well, how am I
supposed to be?

41:04.994 --> 41:06.427
Well, you might be
a little worried

41:06.429 --> 41:09.963
since three <i>Happytime Gang</i> members
are dead, and you could be next.

41:09.965 --> 41:12.036
I'm trying not
to think about it.

41:12.868 --> 41:14.936
I got cops on me.

41:14.938 --> 41:16.770
I don't know what
you expect me to do.

41:16.772 --> 41:18.038
I got to keep working

41:18.040 --> 41:19.440
till the money from the show
comes through.

41:19.442 --> 41:22.342
What do I want you to do? I want
you to take it more seriously.

41:22.344 --> 41:23.311
Jesus Christ, Phil.

41:23.313 --> 41:26.317
Can't you see I'm trying,
you know, to...

41:27.784 --> 41:29.954
I'm trying to forget
about all that.

41:31.353 --> 41:33.156
You were always
so controlling.

41:34.324 --> 41:35.726
All right, I'm sorry.

41:37.326 --> 41:38.726
I loved you.

41:38.728 --> 41:40.994
Hey. Hey...

41:40.996 --> 41:43.333
I just don't want to see you
get hurt, all right?

41:48.138 --> 41:50.204
Hey. Hey, hey.
You want some sugar?

41:50.206 --> 41:51.938
- Glucose, fructose, corn syrup...
- No, thanks.

41:51.940 --> 41:53.206
Hey, hey.

41:53.208 --> 41:54.308
Hey, fella.

41:54.310 --> 41:55.242
Hey, handsome.

41:55.244 --> 41:57.110
Are you looking
for some rotten cotton?

41:57.112 --> 41:58.114
I'm a woman.

41:59.949 --> 42:01.882
- That's okay.
- Yeah, that's even better.

42:01.884 --> 42:03.784
Got a good time for you.

42:04.721 --> 42:07.121
You live your truth, baby.

42:07.123 --> 42:09.724
<i>♪ Peanut buttercup</i>

42:11.393 --> 42:15.098
<i>♪ Gonna get fucked up, sugar ♪</i>

42:16.199 --> 42:18.902
Better get that damn
light out of my eye.

42:20.302 --> 42:21.436
Goofer.

42:21.438 --> 42:22.371
Yeah?

42:22.373 --> 42:25.172
- Hey. Goofer.
- Mmm-hmm.

42:27.476 --> 42:29.309
Ugh. God.

42:30.746 --> 42:31.846
Are you kidding me?

42:31.848 --> 42:35.483
Do you have some sugar for
Goofer, friend?

42:35.485 --> 42:39.052
I just want to know what you know
about the <i>Happytime</i> murders.

42:39.054 --> 42:41.422
Goofer give you a happy time.

42:41.424 --> 42:44.458
For 50 cents,
I'll suck your dick.

42:45.994 --> 42:47.328
Well, it's a great price.

42:47.330 --> 42:49.797
It makes me wish I had a
dick for you to suck.

42:49.799 --> 42:52.467
Yeah. I'm gonna, um,
take that as a yes.

42:54.002 --> 42:55.235
God damn it!

42:55.237 --> 42:59.239
Do not come at me like that. Do
you want me to go for my gun?

42:59.241 --> 43:00.842
No.

43:00.844 --> 43:04.212
Unless you're talking
about your penis.

43:04.214 --> 43:05.480
Then maybe.

43:05.482 --> 43:07.215
Hey, you don't come
at me like that.

43:07.217 --> 43:10.751
For 50 cents
Goofer will give you a felty.

43:10.753 --> 43:11.853
A felty? No.

43:11.855 --> 43:15.223
I'll give you what I call
the "Continental Hot Sock."

43:15.225 --> 43:17.858
I don't want
anything hot from you.

43:17.860 --> 43:21.929
I will need a gallon of
kombucha and some oatmeal.

43:21.931 --> 43:23.496
- No.
- It's only 50 cents.

43:23.498 --> 43:26.900
Just answer my question. What do you
know about the <i>Happytime</i> murders?

43:26.902 --> 43:29.137
They're married. The wife.

43:29.139 --> 43:32.373
Married? Whose wife?
What did you say?

43:32.375 --> 43:33.775
The wife. Where?

43:33.777 --> 43:35.976
Yeah. You've got it.
The wife of who?

43:35.978 --> 43:37.110
You're my wife?

43:37.112 --> 43:39.179
I don't remember
getting married,

43:39.181 --> 43:42.083
but you're pretty cute
for a fella in a suit.

43:42.085 --> 43:45.253
I said "wife" because you said
"wife." Are you saying wife?

43:45.255 --> 43:46.353
The wife!

43:51.828 --> 43:53.261
The wife...

44:05.107 --> 44:06.940
I peed on that mirror.

44:06.942 --> 44:09.912
You better get checked
'cause that shit is salty.

44:11.915 --> 44:13.413
It's fine,
I know the plan.

44:13.415 --> 44:16.250
I'll call you when I check into a motel.
All right?

44:16.252 --> 44:18.853
- You promise?
- Yeah. I promise.

44:18.855 --> 44:20.190
I just want you to be safe.

44:21.456 --> 44:24.592
Do you remember the first time
you ever walked me to my car?

44:24.594 --> 44:25.793
Of course I do.

44:25.795 --> 44:31.132
It was the first time we met.
Larry's birthday at the, um...

44:31.134 --> 44:32.436
- The Formosa.
- The Formosa.

44:34.103 --> 44:36.436
Yeah, you were so sweet.

44:36.438 --> 44:38.572
Making sure I was safe.

44:38.574 --> 44:41.078
Well, I'd never met anyone
like you before.

44:42.978 --> 44:46.250
You ever feel like
me and you should, um...

44:50.286 --> 44:51.388
Start over?

44:53.389 --> 44:55.088
Uh, Jenny, I'm poison.

44:55.090 --> 44:57.625
I poisoned me and you,
I poisoned my career.

44:57.627 --> 45:01.462
Hell, I poisoned every good puppet's
chance of ever becoming a cop.

45:01.464 --> 45:04.264
- That wasn't your fault.
- It doesn't matter.

45:04.266 --> 45:08.004
I still feel sick about it
every goddamn day.

45:11.040 --> 45:14.578
Every poison has an antidote.

45:25.455 --> 45:27.087
Good night, Phil Philips.

45:27.089 --> 45:28.391
Good night, Jenny.

45:32.561 --> 45:34.962
<i>Yeah, it was great seeing Jenny again...</i>

45:34.964 --> 45:38.534
<i>...reminded me that somewhere in my
stuffing-filled chest was still a...</i>

45:41.203 --> 45:42.339
No!

45:45.574 --> 45:46.974
Jenny!

45:52.648 --> 45:55.116
- Shit, shit, shit.
- <i>Freeze, Philips!</i>

45:55.118 --> 45:56.985
<i>My head was spinning.</i>

45:56.987 --> 46:00.387
<i>Larry, Jenny. Everyone in this world I
care about was getting knocked off.</i>

46:00.389 --> 46:03.456
<i>I just needed to lay low, and as
much as I hated to admit it...</i>

46:03.458 --> 46:04.458
Edwards?

46:04.460 --> 46:06.496
<i>There was only
one place I could go.</i>

46:07.931 --> 46:09.963
Oh, dear God.

46:09.965 --> 46:12.034
She's a complete sugar smack.

46:13.002 --> 46:14.270
You awake?

46:17.473 --> 46:19.442
Oh, no.

46:55.043 --> 46:56.309
Drop the fucking gun.

46:56.311 --> 46:58.112
Drop your gun, or I'm
gonna fucking kill her!

46:58.114 --> 46:59.646
Take the fucking shot, Phil.

46:59.648 --> 47:01.014
<i>Need a clean shot.</i>

47:01.016 --> 47:02.083
You're a puppet, not a fleshy.

47:02.085 --> 47:04.050
- Why are you messing with me?
- Take the fucking shot!

47:04.052 --> 47:05.119
Take the shot, Phil!

47:05.121 --> 47:06.323
<i>Bye-bye, puppet.</i>

47:16.665 --> 47:18.398
Daddy!

47:18.400 --> 47:19.435
Daddy!

47:22.739 --> 47:24.407
No, no, no, no, no!

47:30.679 --> 47:32.212
No! Daddy!

47:32.214 --> 47:33.413
Multiple shots fired.

47:33.415 --> 47:36.683
Civilian casualty and officer down.
Sixth and Grand.

47:36.685 --> 47:39.253
Edwards, Jesus Christ.

47:39.255 --> 47:41.255
What the fuck, Phil?
How could you miss him?

47:41.257 --> 47:43.623
I'm sorry, I choked.
You're gonna be all right.

47:43.625 --> 47:47.061
Hey, hey, hang on. You just
hang on, you understand?

47:47.063 --> 47:48.596
Hey!

47:48.598 --> 47:51.368
A little help here?
Can you get me some help?

47:52.335 --> 47:53.668
Out of the way, incoming.

47:53.670 --> 47:56.804
Dr. Trevor, we have a fleshy with
a bullet wound through the liver.

47:56.806 --> 48:00.273
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?
- She's been shot.

48:00.275 --> 48:03.043
No, no, no, we don't treat
humans here.

48:03.045 --> 48:04.744
We only have parts
for puppets.

48:04.746 --> 48:06.047
She's dying, Doc.

48:06.049 --> 48:09.652
I'm sorry, I cannot do anything about it.
It's unethical.

48:11.855 --> 48:15.659
You're gonna save my partner's
life, or you're gonna die trying.

48:17.527 --> 48:19.360
Phil, wake up.

48:19.362 --> 48:22.529
- Wake up, Phil.
- Wakey-wakey!

48:22.531 --> 48:23.730
Wake up, Phil.

48:23.732 --> 48:25.132
Wake up, Phil.

48:25.134 --> 48:27.067
- Phil, wake up!
- Hey, hey.

48:29.605 --> 48:31.838
Did you fucking break
into my house?

48:33.141 --> 48:36.379
I, uh... I had
nowhere else to go.

48:37.246 --> 48:40.684
And, uh, Jenny's dead.

48:42.418 --> 48:43.817
What?

48:43.819 --> 48:45.755
Yeah. They think I did it.

48:49.659 --> 48:50.761
Fuck.

48:55.665 --> 48:57.697
- I'm sorry, Phil.
- Yeah.

49:03.172 --> 49:05.271
Did you clean my apartment?

49:05.273 --> 49:07.574
- Yeah. You got a problem with that?
- It's just weird.

49:07.576 --> 49:09.175
It's like stealing
somebody's car

49:09.177 --> 49:11.445
just so you can put
new fucking tires on it.

49:11.447 --> 49:14.317
- I don't know how to take this.
- Are you gonna get that, or what?

49:15.384 --> 49:16.449
Edwards.

49:16.451 --> 49:18.321
By the way, you sleep
with your mouth wide open.

49:19.154 --> 49:20.721
Like this.

49:20.723 --> 49:22.625
- Shut up.
- Who sleeps like that?

49:23.159 --> 49:24.324
Uh, um...

49:24.326 --> 49:27.561
- Yeah, I was... I saw Goofer last night.
- What? Who is this?

49:27.563 --> 49:28.728
Uh-huh.

49:28.730 --> 49:29.896
Philips?

49:29.898 --> 49:31.232
- What?
- No. It's just,

49:31.234 --> 49:33.333
this doesn't sound like
something Phil...

49:33.335 --> 49:35.335
- Who is it?
- Yes, sir.

49:35.337 --> 49:37.471
- Crystal clear.
- Oh, shit.

49:37.473 --> 49:40.373
Uh, no. I haven't seen him.
No. Yes, sir.

49:40.375 --> 49:42.311
- Is it the lieutenant?
- Yes, sir.

49:44.212 --> 49:45.348
What? What? What?

49:45.882 --> 49:47.384
Goofer's washed up.

49:47.782 --> 49:49.219
Literally.

49:49.752 --> 49:50.853
Shit.

49:56.759 --> 49:59.726
Looks like a pretty
classic smash and splash.

49:59.728 --> 50:02.630
Beat his head in,
threw him off the pier.

50:02.632 --> 50:04.898
Man, I thought
he smelled bad alive.

50:04.900 --> 50:06.699
You guys might
wanna look away.

50:06.701 --> 50:08.501
This will not be pretty.

50:08.503 --> 50:10.339
Ah, Christ.

50:12.909 --> 50:16.777
Edwards, is your history with
Philips gonna be a problem here?

50:16.779 --> 50:18.179
No, it's not.

50:18.181 --> 50:20.346
If he did it,
I'll bring him in myself.

50:20.348 --> 50:22.718
If he makes any contact,
I wanna know immediately.

50:24.420 --> 50:26.554
What's in the cooler?

50:26.556 --> 50:30.357
My lunch. I get very
hungry for cold foods.

50:30.359 --> 50:31.527
Okay. Drop him in.

50:32.661 --> 50:33.897
There we go.

50:35.397 --> 50:36.732
God, I hate the beach.

50:42.938 --> 50:47.310
You know, that Agent Campbell
is a real douchebag.

50:49.277 --> 50:50.677
You trying to asphyxiate me?

50:50.679 --> 50:52.947
Hey, I said a backpack,
you said the cooler. So...

50:52.949 --> 50:56.319
Yeah. I said a cooler with holes.
There's no holes.

50:58.753 --> 51:00.420
A wife, huh?

51:00.422 --> 51:01.922
So, it's gotta be
Ezra and Cara.

51:01.924 --> 51:05.826
Yeah. Why don't we pay a little visit
to those creepy kissing cousins?

51:05.828 --> 51:08.329
All right, let's go. You wanna
help me get the hell out of here?

51:08.331 --> 51:10.496
- Oh, yeah. All right, don't worry.
- Jesus Christ.

51:10.498 --> 51:12.699
I think you might have done
some irreparable damage.

51:12.701 --> 51:15.001
- That's my neck.
- Well, let me just...

51:15.003 --> 51:17.570
- I'm gonna try something.
- Go ahead.

51:17.572 --> 51:19.706
- That's my balls! What are you doing?
- Oh, God.

51:19.708 --> 51:21.842
- Jesus Christ!
- I thought it was your shoe.

51:23.511 --> 51:26.380
God damn it. There you go,
there you go.

51:26.382 --> 51:27.581
- Okay, okay.
- Attaboy, attaboy.

51:27.583 --> 51:28.752
It's like a fucking birth.

51:31.587 --> 51:34.320
<i>Ezra and Cara,
the kissing cousins</i>

51:34.322 --> 51:36.422
<i>hadn't made
a public appearance in years.</i>

51:36.424 --> 51:37.891
<i>They moved out
to the middle of nowhere,</i>

51:37.893 --> 51:41.427
<i>had a couple of kids, which
is fucked up, if you ask me.</i>

51:41.429 --> 51:44.498
<i>But it was a two-hour drive, and
Edwards had gone moody as shit,</i>

51:44.500 --> 51:46.570
<i>which didn't make
the time go any faster.</i>

51:46.868 --> 51:48.434
You're quiet.

51:50.005 --> 51:52.005
What, did you take
a vow of silence?

51:52.007 --> 51:53.373
What,
are you a monk now?

51:53.375 --> 51:54.743
No, I'm not a monk.

51:58.514 --> 52:00.717
Actually, I don't know
what the hell I am anymore.

52:01.484 --> 52:03.349
What're you talking about?

52:03.351 --> 52:06.690
Well, what am I?
Am I a human? Am I a puppet?

52:08.523 --> 52:09.889
Truth is, I'm neither.

52:09.891 --> 52:14.795
I'm just scratching and clawing
from one sugar fix to the next.

52:14.797 --> 52:17.766
Neither side wants me,
and I don't blame them.

52:21.304 --> 52:22.572
I'm sorry.

52:26.509 --> 52:28.411
I'm sorry I missed that day.

52:30.011 --> 52:32.045
I'm sorry I shot
the wrong guy.

52:32.047 --> 52:34.817
I'm sorry a little girl
lost her father.

52:38.920 --> 52:40.924
I'm sorry you're struggling.

52:45.328 --> 52:47.530
But I'm glad
you're still here.

52:55.603 --> 52:56.939
What the fuck is this?

52:57.973 --> 52:59.605
What? What are you
asking me for?

52:59.607 --> 53:01.507
- Turn that shit off.
- You're making fun of me?

53:01.509 --> 53:03.610
It's your car,
it's on your radio.

53:03.612 --> 53:04.545
I didn't put it on.

53:04.547 --> 53:05.811
- It says right there.
- Well, it's not your...

53:05.813 --> 53:09.616
It says, look, "Paired with
Edwards' phone" or something. Look.

53:09.618 --> 53:11.451
- I don't even have that...
- Turn it off.

53:11.453 --> 53:13.954
- ...song in... I will turn it off.
- Why won't these work?

53:13.956 --> 53:15.088
Jesus Christ, turn it off.

53:15.090 --> 53:17.358
It's like a tampon
commercial in here.

53:17.360 --> 53:18.759
Stop yelling at me!
You know what...

53:18.761 --> 53:20.360
How many pockets do you...

53:20.362 --> 53:21.994
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

53:21.996 --> 53:23.563
Jesus Christ!

53:23.565 --> 53:25.766
You wanted it off?

53:25.768 --> 53:27.067
Now it's off.

53:32.942 --> 53:36.710
What the... You fucking...
You shot your fucking radio.

53:36.712 --> 53:39.112
- Whoo! I shot my radio.
- You're out of your fucking mind.

53:39.114 --> 53:40.447
Oh, I feel better.

53:41.683 --> 53:43.416
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Christ.

53:43.418 --> 53:44.650
- There's my phone.
- What?

53:44.652 --> 53:46.790
You know what?
Yeah, that was me.

54:11.679 --> 54:13.746
Looks like we beat the rush.

54:13.748 --> 54:15.815
Yeah, well, they killed
the whole gang.

54:15.817 --> 54:17.717
They're not coming out
without a fight.

54:17.719 --> 54:19.719
Well, let's give them one,
partner.

54:19.721 --> 54:21.657
- Partner?
- Shut up.

54:24.159 --> 54:26.427
Here.
Better safe than dead.

54:26.429 --> 54:28.962
What? You still have this?

54:28.964 --> 54:31.165
- I'm a bit of a hoarder.
- I think you missed me.

54:45.147 --> 54:46.579
All right,
I'll take the front.

54:46.581 --> 54:48.215
I'll take the back.
Meet you in the middle.

54:48.217 --> 54:49.985
Yep. Just like old times.

55:16.045 --> 55:17.547
Damn it.

55:19.014 --> 55:20.646
All right. I'll huff...

55:20.648 --> 55:23.217
And I'll puff, and I'll blow
your fucking door down!

55:45.241 --> 55:47.811
Hey. Hey, where
is your mommy and daddy?

55:50.679 --> 55:52.715
That's why you don't swim
in your own gene pool.

55:54.683 --> 55:56.652
They don't
have a fucking chance.

55:58.721 --> 56:00.820
What was that?
What the hell did you see?

56:00.822 --> 56:02.792
We gotta call child services.

56:03.292 --> 56:04.724
What?

56:04.726 --> 56:06.830
It's like
<i>Children of the Corn.</i>

56:07.830 --> 56:09.829
You want chili with corn?

56:09.831 --> 56:11.868
What? What the fuck
is "chili porn"?

56:12.935 --> 56:14.000
What?

56:14.002 --> 56:15.469
I can't read your lips,
you're a fucking puppet.

56:15.471 --> 56:17.871
What the fuck are you... I don't
even know what you're talking about!

56:17.873 --> 56:20.974
All I'm seeing is that
you look like a cloth vagina.

56:20.976 --> 56:22.308
I'm not whispering, I'm not...

56:22.310 --> 56:24.610
Ezra? Cara?

56:24.612 --> 56:26.012
We got you surrounded.

56:26.014 --> 56:27.681
LAPD.

56:27.683 --> 56:29.315
Nobody has to get hurt.

56:29.317 --> 56:32.087
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

56:40.094 --> 56:42.165
Oh, no. Jesus...

56:43.132 --> 56:44.167
Edwards!

56:50.639 --> 56:52.038
- Freeze!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

56:52.040 --> 56:53.773
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

56:53.775 --> 56:55.175
Freeze, Philips!

56:55.177 --> 56:58.110
You guys got this all wrong.
The killer's getting away.

56:58.112 --> 56:59.746
Put the weapon down!

56:59.748 --> 57:02.719
- Drop the weapon!
- Okay. I'm dropping it.

57:03.252 --> 57:04.784
Aw, shitcakes.

57:04.786 --> 57:06.221
Edwards! Drop the weapon!

57:07.288 --> 57:09.024
Put the weapon down!

57:10.159 --> 57:12.058
- Drop the weapon!
- I did!

57:12.060 --> 57:13.159
- Now!
- What?

57:13.161 --> 57:15.027
Somebody want to help out
Stevie Ray Vaughan here?

57:15.029 --> 57:16.829
'Cause he's obviously
fucking blind.

57:16.831 --> 57:18.764
Stevie Ray Vaughan
is not blind.

57:18.766 --> 57:20.366
- Jesus Christ.
- Asshole says what?

57:20.368 --> 57:21.701
What?

57:23.172 --> 57:24.704
This is my last warning.

57:24.706 --> 57:27.206
- Put the weapon down!
- It is dropped.

57:27.208 --> 57:29.177
- She dropped it.
- It's on the fucking ground.

57:30.078 --> 57:32.047
Oh. Sorry.

57:32.681 --> 57:34.213
Go arrest them.

57:46.962 --> 57:49.730
You can't actually like me
for these murders.

57:49.732 --> 57:51.331
We like you very much
for these murders.

57:51.333 --> 57:54.704
- What's my motive?
- The reason most men do stupid things.

57:55.069 --> 57:56.205
A woman.

57:58.107 --> 57:59.208
Enjoy the show.

58:00.676 --> 58:02.375
What the hell
is she doing here?

58:02.377 --> 58:03.710
Who is that?

58:03.712 --> 58:05.712
It's Sandra White.
She's one of my clients.

58:05.714 --> 58:07.880
Actually, her name
is Sandra Peterson.

58:07.882 --> 58:10.083
She walked into the federal
building this morning

58:10.085 --> 58:12.985
and said you murdered
her wife, Jenny Peterson.

58:12.987 --> 58:14.855
Hey, I didn't
murder anybody.

58:14.857 --> 58:16.723
I didn't know
Jenny was even married.

58:16.725 --> 58:18.025
Neither did I.

58:18.027 --> 58:19.059
Let's listen in.

58:19.061 --> 58:21.128
<i>Well, he said
that he killed them.</i>

58:21.130 --> 58:24.998
<i>The entire Happytime Gang,
even his own brother.</i>

58:25.000 --> 58:26.666
- What?
- <i>And why would he do that?</i>

58:26.668 --> 58:28.034
We've been
having an affair,

58:28.036 --> 58:29.735
and he wanted
to run away together.

58:29.737 --> 58:31.137
He said
he killed them all

58:31.139 --> 58:33.739
so that I would get
my wife Jenny's share,

58:33.741 --> 58:34.840
and then I'd be rich,

58:34.842 --> 58:36.942
and he could have me
all to himself.

58:36.944 --> 58:38.878
I should have kept
my fuzzy blue in my pants.

58:38.880 --> 58:39.846
Shut up, Phil.

58:39.848 --> 58:43.282
And how long had you been
having this affair?

58:43.284 --> 58:44.884
Months.

58:44.886 --> 58:47.286
We'd rendezvous
at his office.

58:47.288 --> 58:50.025
I saw you there, remember?

58:54.929 --> 58:56.299
Just like the French.

58:58.567 --> 59:02.369
Well, I guess now we know the purple
carpet doesn't match the drapes.

59:02.371 --> 59:03.904
I think we've heard enough.

59:03.906 --> 59:05.838
What? This is a setup.

59:05.840 --> 59:07.741
Sandra White came to me
as a client

59:07.743 --> 59:09.141
and sent me
to that porno shop.

59:09.143 --> 59:10.976
She orchestrated
the whole thing.

59:10.978 --> 59:12.344
Jesus, Phil.

59:12.346 --> 59:16.282
You were there when every member of
the Happytime Gang was murdered.

59:16.284 --> 59:18.819
- My hands are tied.
- Lieutenant, come on.

59:18.821 --> 59:19.920
Get him out of here.

59:19.922 --> 59:21.188
- Lieutenant, what're you doing?
- Come on with...

59:21.190 --> 59:24.056
No, this is ridiculous.
Come on.

59:24.058 --> 59:26.492
Okay. All right.
All right, tough guy.

59:26.494 --> 59:29.195
Come on, guys. You don't really
have to cuff him, do you?

59:29.197 --> 59:31.797
Edwards, you know I'm innocent.
Get me out of here.

59:31.799 --> 59:32.935
Jesus.

59:34.302 --> 59:36.036
Hey, Campbell.

59:36.038 --> 59:38.137
Listen, I know that Philips
is a pain in the ass,

59:38.139 --> 59:40.206
but you don't actually
like him for this, do you?

59:40.208 --> 59:43.076
Philips was at every murder scene,
and we have a witness to prove it.

59:43.078 --> 59:44.411
What else do you want, Edwards?

59:44.413 --> 59:47.848
I mean, you of all people going
to bat for a goddamn puppet.

59:47.850 --> 59:49.416
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

59:49.418 --> 59:53.920
I'm sticking up for him because my gut is
telling me that Philips didn't do this.

59:53.922 --> 59:57.858
Yeah, well, of course your gut is
saying that, it's full of puppet fluff.

59:57.860 --> 59:58.958
You're a fucking asshole.

59:58.960 --> 01:00:02.061
Listen to yourself,
or is that your liver talking?

01:00:02.063 --> 01:00:03.996
- You fucking...
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:00:03.998 --> 01:00:05.931
Knock it off, you two!

01:00:05.933 --> 01:00:08.067
You sugared fuck!
Get away!

01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:10.402
- Get off of me!
- Knock it off!

01:00:11.973 --> 01:00:13.806
- God, you two!
- Get off!

01:00:13.808 --> 01:00:16.076
That's it!
You're done, Edwards.

01:00:16.078 --> 01:00:17.777
Consider yourself suspended.

01:00:17.779 --> 01:00:20.246
- Give me your badge.
- Yeah. Great. Here.

01:00:20.248 --> 01:00:21.480
Fucking choke on it.

01:00:21.482 --> 01:00:22.983
Fuck all of you guys.

01:00:22.985 --> 01:00:24.918
Fuck you, Wreach.
You know what?

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.253
It's my fucking charger that

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:28.855
you never asked for
and you never gave back.

01:00:28.857 --> 01:00:30.857
- Nice.
- You all fucking suck.

01:00:30.859 --> 01:00:32.425
Yeah, yeah.
Burn every bridge. Good.

01:00:32.427 --> 01:00:35.328
And you know what? Everybody knows
Karen is not a real redhead.

01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:37.130
- I'm a real redhead.
- No, you're not.

01:00:37.132 --> 01:00:40.166
You had enough bush coming out of
your cutoffs at the family picnic

01:00:40.168 --> 01:00:42.369
- to fucking choke a horse.
- Jeez.

01:00:42.371 --> 01:00:44.971
Carol, we never got to talk,
but you seem cool.

01:00:44.973 --> 01:00:47.143
And I wish I would've
fucked you, Donny.

01:00:48.009 --> 01:00:49.311
It's not too late.

01:00:51.413 --> 01:00:52.415
It's not.

01:01:03.491 --> 01:01:06.492
Oh, God damn it.

01:01:06.494 --> 01:01:08.829
How the hell
did you get in here?

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.130
It was actually very easy.

01:01:10.132 --> 01:01:12.398
I just picked the lock, it
took me, like, under a minute.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.369
Oh, great. Apparently anybody who wants
to can just walk right into my apartment.

01:01:16.371 --> 01:01:19.038
- Great.
- Listen, I need your help to save him.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.442
Do you know what they'll do
to a puppet ex-cop in prison?

01:01:22.444 --> 01:01:27.917
They will tear out all of his stuffing
and fill him back up with rice pilaf.

01:01:29.317 --> 01:01:31.918
- And then they'll fuck it.
- Okay, just...

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.922
They fuck that rice pilaf until
it's more like a mashed potato.

01:01:35.924 --> 01:01:37.056
Okay.

01:01:37.058 --> 01:01:39.592
It's a term they call
"pilafing."

01:01:39.594 --> 01:01:41.930
All right, all right,
all right. Move.

01:01:43.264 --> 01:01:45.931
You think you are the only one
thinking about this stuff?

01:01:45.933 --> 01:01:47.634
I think about pilafing
all the time.

01:01:47.636 --> 01:01:49.101
I'm not talking
about pilafing.

01:01:49.103 --> 01:01:52.105
I've been searching public records on
Sandra White, and guess what I found?

01:01:52.107 --> 01:01:54.641
Nothing. There is no Sandra
White before two years ago.

01:01:54.643 --> 01:01:57.476
She didn't exist. Can I
have one of those bananas?

01:01:57.478 --> 01:01:59.612
What? No, you can't. No.

01:01:59.614 --> 01:02:02.549
And what do you mean she didn't exist?
Everybody exists.

01:02:02.551 --> 01:02:04.650
Social Security numbers,
tax records.

01:02:04.652 --> 01:02:05.851
<i>Nada.</i>

01:02:05.853 --> 01:02:08.290
But I tailed her to a rat trap
of an apartment in Hollywood.

01:02:10.025 --> 01:02:11.458
What's she doing
in a Hollywood apartment?

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.492
She's got a big place
up in the Palisades.

01:02:13.494 --> 01:02:16.029
You know what? I don't care
and I don't wanna know.

01:02:16.031 --> 01:02:18.063
And you shouldn't be
following people, Bubbles.

01:02:18.065 --> 01:02:19.199
It's dangerous.

01:02:19.201 --> 01:02:22.268
We are the only people in the
world that can save Phil.

01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:24.306
And I can't
do it by myself

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.342
'cause I wear heels.

01:02:27.042 --> 01:02:28.641
I occasionally wear heels.

01:02:28.643 --> 01:02:30.312
I don't think so.

01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:33.014
Come on.

01:02:34.449 --> 01:02:36.485
Shitcakes.

01:02:38.987 --> 01:02:41.157
Yeah! No.

01:02:43.991 --> 01:02:46.025
Here.

01:02:46.027 --> 01:02:48.363
Okay, I see it.
I see the number.

01:02:56.138 --> 01:02:58.070
I don't
think anybody's there.

01:02:58.072 --> 01:03:00.974
All right,
I'm gonna get us in.

01:03:00.976 --> 01:03:02.509
What the fuck are you doing
with the banana?

01:03:02.511 --> 01:03:03.944
I got it
from your apartment.

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:06.281
Jesus, put it away.
I'm gonna get us in.

01:03:07.148 --> 01:03:09.248
- Watch for me.
- No, no, no.

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:11.286
Move out of the way.
You're so dramatic.

01:03:13.422 --> 01:03:16.125
- What, do you rob houses on the weekends?
- Shh!

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.425
Impressive.

01:03:19.427 --> 01:03:22.230
Well, a girl's
got to be resourceful.

01:03:22.697 --> 01:03:24.400
Come in. Shut the door.

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:29.505
Okay.

01:03:31.373 --> 01:03:33.172
Something doesn't
feel right.

01:03:33.174 --> 01:03:34.708
I'm not buying
that two women live here.

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.710
I'm not buying
that anybody lives here.

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:39.447
There's no photos
or personal items.

01:03:40.715 --> 01:03:42.047
Huh.

01:03:42.049 --> 01:03:43.416
Look at this, nothing.

01:03:43.418 --> 01:03:45.321
Is that the bedroom
back there?

01:03:49.690 --> 01:03:51.226
It's the bathroom.

01:03:53.395 --> 01:03:55.128
Bingo.

01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:56.228
We got another room
back there.

01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:58.697
- What?
- There's a room behind this.

01:03:58.699 --> 01:04:00.435
- Help me. Come on, help me.
- This?

01:04:00.768 --> 01:04:02.335
Push it.

01:04:03.205 --> 01:04:04.706
- Ooh. Wow!
- God.

01:04:06.241 --> 01:04:08.174
Oh, boy, that's creepy.

01:04:08.176 --> 01:04:09.645
You don't see that every day.

01:04:14.215 --> 01:04:15.282
Okay, stand back.

01:04:15.284 --> 01:04:17.116
Stand back, I'm going
to get us in. I don't need...

01:04:17.118 --> 01:04:19.487
- I got it.
- I don't need. I got it. I've got it.

01:04:22.156 --> 01:04:24.225
Oh.

01:04:25.127 --> 01:04:26.793
I blew my hymen.

01:04:26.795 --> 01:04:28.762
That looks really painful.

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:30.499
Ooh, my under-chassis.

01:04:31.433 --> 01:04:33.369
I'm gonna have to ice my junk.

01:04:36.237 --> 01:04:39.139
It was relatively easier
than the other.

01:04:39.141 --> 01:04:42.775
Okay. Wait, wait... Okay.

01:04:42.777 --> 01:04:44.476
Okay, stand...
Can you please give me...

01:04:44.478 --> 01:04:46.612
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't hold my hand.

01:04:46.614 --> 01:04:47.713
I won't. I won't.

01:04:47.715 --> 01:04:49.382
God, you're so... You're...

01:04:49.384 --> 01:04:51.116
- I'm so...
- Stop touching me.

01:04:51.118 --> 01:04:53.154
- I'm so nervous.
- Stop touching me.

01:05:03.098 --> 01:05:04.230
Oh, my God.

01:05:04.232 --> 01:05:07.567
We've got ourselves
a good old-fashioned nutjob.

01:05:07.569 --> 01:05:10.203
Jeez,
this must have taken years.

01:05:10.205 --> 01:05:12.271
This is one sick fuck.

01:05:12.273 --> 01:05:13.609
She's got them all.

01:05:15.509 --> 01:05:18.346
Detective Edwards, look.

01:05:19.547 --> 01:05:22.849
Why, she's got a real sweet
spot for our boy Phil, huh.

01:05:22.851 --> 01:05:25.351
Poor Mr. P.

01:05:25.353 --> 01:05:28.221
- Oh, my God.
- Wait a minute.

01:05:28.223 --> 01:05:29.692
What a psycho.

01:05:32.761 --> 01:05:37.630
What the hell's she doing with the picture
of Jasper Jackabee and his daughter?

01:05:37.632 --> 01:05:40.569
Purple hair
on a puppet, that's very rare.

01:05:41.703 --> 01:05:42.772
Oh, my God.

01:05:43.871 --> 01:05:46.408
I saw you there,
remember?

01:05:49.578 --> 01:05:52.212
I guess the carpet does match the drapes.

01:05:52.214 --> 01:05:54.114
I knew this skirt
was see-through.

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:56.882
I just don't like wearing underwear.
I don't like the way it feels.

01:05:56.884 --> 01:05:59.152
I'm not talking about you.

01:05:59.154 --> 01:06:01.688
Sandra White
is Jackabee's daughter.

01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:04.523
What a fucking psycho bitch.

01:06:04.525 --> 01:06:07.192
This room is like
a signed confession from her.

01:06:07.194 --> 01:06:09.462
Also proves
that Phil is innocent.

01:06:09.464 --> 01:06:10.529
We got her.

01:06:10.531 --> 01:06:13.199
- "Play me"?
- No, no, no! Don't touch it!

01:06:13.201 --> 01:06:14.666
<i>Ka-fucking-boom!</i>

01:06:14.668 --> 01:06:16.469
- Oh, my God!
- Get out!

01:06:16.471 --> 01:06:17.570
Go, go, go.

01:06:18.672 --> 01:06:19.741
Go!

01:06:25.346 --> 01:06:26.746
You know I have
no bones, right?

01:06:26.748 --> 01:06:29.181
You're basically fluffing
a pillow here.

01:06:29.183 --> 01:06:30.884
Knock it off.

01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:32.619
Philips, you got a visitor.

01:06:34.456 --> 01:06:36.623
Let's go!

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:39.893
All right.
Well, I'll see you later, Tommy.

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:41.464
I just need five minutes.

01:06:45.232 --> 01:06:47.567
Jesus Christ, Phil,
you look terrible.

01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:50.536
Yeah? Well, at least
I didn't get fucking pilafed.

01:06:50.538 --> 01:06:51.938
- I gotta go.
- Okay, wait a minute.

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:53.038
Wait a minute.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.340
Listen, I know I didn't
have your back before,

01:06:55.342 --> 01:06:58.311
but I had no juice
to do it with, and now I do.

01:06:58.313 --> 01:07:00.512
The <i>Happytime</i> murders
aren't about the money.

01:07:00.514 --> 01:07:03.650
Twenty years ago, when you shot
that man in front of his daughter,

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:05.617
that little girl
was Sandra White.

01:07:08.223 --> 01:07:10.456
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, holy shit.

01:07:10.458 --> 01:07:11.660
So, you have proof?

01:07:14.529 --> 01:07:18.797
Yes and no. We had proof
until it was incinerated.

01:07:18.799 --> 01:07:20.132
Hmm.

01:07:20.134 --> 01:07:25.837
Bubbles and I may have accidentally,
uh, burned down the evidence.

01:07:25.839 --> 01:07:27.540
- What?
- But, boy, before that,

01:07:27.542 --> 01:07:29.675
I'll tell you what,
lock her up.

01:07:29.677 --> 01:07:30.909
That would have
been great, huh?

01:07:30.911 --> 01:07:32.545
Would have been epic.

01:07:32.547 --> 01:07:33.880
- Would have been nice.
- Yeah.

01:07:33.882 --> 01:07:34.915
See you at my execution.

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:37.282
Look, if we want to
get you off the hook for this,

01:07:37.284 --> 01:07:38.821
we gotta take
down Sandra White.

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:40.556
All right.

01:07:41.355 --> 01:07:43.489
What are you
thinking, partner?

01:07:43.491 --> 01:07:46.659
I am thinking about busting
your ass out of here.

01:07:46.661 --> 01:07:48.293
- Okay.
- What are you gonna do?

01:07:48.295 --> 01:07:49.695
Wait, what are you doing?

01:07:51.632 --> 01:07:53.299
I'm gonna shoot you
in the arm.

01:07:53.301 --> 01:07:54.433
You did shoot me in the arm!

01:07:54.435 --> 01:07:56.703
Officer needs assistance!

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:59.438
Self-defense! There's been
a shooting! Oh, God!

01:08:04.946 --> 01:08:07.614
What are you,
some kind of qualified tailor?

01:08:07.616 --> 01:08:09.482
Just let me do
my job, pal, okay?

01:08:09.484 --> 01:08:11.451
To me, that's a waste
of good gauze.

01:08:11.453 --> 01:08:13.619
Yeah, I hear you.

01:08:13.621 --> 01:08:14.587
Edwards...

01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:17.323
Shut up, you dirty sock.

01:08:17.325 --> 01:08:18.424
Yeah, pal?

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:20.862
I can't believe
you fucking shot me.

01:08:22.328 --> 01:08:24.764
Here, get yourself out.
I'm gonna get that.

01:08:28.937 --> 01:08:31.970
Thought you were gonna
bite me in the dick again.

01:08:31.971 --> 01:08:35.475
Boy, puppets
are the worst, huh?

01:08:35.477 --> 01:08:37.010
Does this smell
like chloroform to you?

01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:39.348
What?

01:08:41.316 --> 01:08:42.582
Good night, asshole.

01:08:44.051 --> 01:08:47.019
- Driver, can I ask you a quick question?
- No, no. Wait for a red light.

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.488
Gotta go.

01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:50.354
Philips Investigations.

01:08:51.993 --> 01:08:54.359
Slow, slow, slow,
slow, slow down!

01:08:54.361 --> 01:08:56.095
Tell us what you got, Bubbles.

01:08:56.096 --> 01:08:59.497
Sandra booked a private plane to Rio that
leaves out of Santa Monica in 30 minutes.

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:00.567
- Shit.
- Jesus Christ.

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:02.734
All right, thanks, Bubbles,
you're a real peach.

01:09:02.736 --> 01:09:04.537
Go get her.

01:09:04.538 --> 01:09:05.572
Let's hit it,
let's go, let's go.

01:09:05.573 --> 01:09:07.640
All right, all right,
I'm going hot and loud.

01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:27.024
Okay. How do you
wanna do this?

01:09:27.027 --> 01:09:28.094
Alone.

01:09:28.095 --> 01:09:30.328
What? Oh, my God.

01:09:30.331 --> 01:09:32.064
- Phil, give me my gun.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:09:32.066 --> 01:09:35.335
I ruined your life once before,
I'm not doing it again.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:36.903
This is crazy,
we're partners.

01:09:36.904 --> 01:09:39.841
You know this is
not what partners do.

01:09:40.908 --> 01:09:41.944
Shit!

01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:47.511
Oh, um, excuse me, sir.
This is a private terminal.

01:09:47.514 --> 01:09:49.747
You clearly are not
wealthy enough to be here.

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:51.716
You need to get
the fuck outta here.

01:09:52.987 --> 01:09:56.725
Stay calm, Mike. Just shimmy
out like Mommy told you to.

01:09:59.861 --> 01:10:02.564
Freeze. It's over, Sandra.

01:10:04.699 --> 01:10:07.100
What are you gonna do,
shoot me?

01:10:07.102 --> 01:10:09.034
I messed up, Sandra.

01:10:09.036 --> 01:10:10.103
I missed the shot,

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:12.704
and I ruined all of our
lives in the process,

01:10:12.706 --> 01:10:15.108
and I live with that guilt
every day.

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:16.876
I'm sorry.

01:10:16.878 --> 01:10:19.811
That's so sweet.
But go fuck yourself.

01:10:19.813 --> 01:10:22.582
Larry and Jenny didn't have
anything to do with this.

01:10:22.584 --> 01:10:23.850
None of them did.

01:10:23.852 --> 01:10:25.984
Why'd you have to keep killing
the whole gang?

01:10:25.986 --> 01:10:28.453
I wanted
to watch you suffer.

01:10:28.455 --> 01:10:33.826
This all started as revenge, but you
made me realize I like killing.

01:10:33.828 --> 01:10:36.561
And I'm really
fucking good at it.

01:10:36.563 --> 01:10:38.530
Like Manson-level good.

01:10:38.532 --> 01:10:42.167
And now, with $10 million,
I can do anything.

01:10:42.169 --> 01:10:43.235
All right,
so you're a psycho.

01:10:43.237 --> 01:10:46.939
Maybe, but sex is always
better with a psycho.

01:10:46.941 --> 01:10:50.176
- Right, honey?
- Yeah, especially felt ones.

01:10:50.178 --> 01:10:53.011
Because our vaginas
are literally velvet.

01:10:53.013 --> 01:10:55.915
- Oh, yeah.
- Drop it, Phil.

01:10:55.917 --> 01:10:58.551
You definitely look hotter
than the last time I saw you.

01:10:58.553 --> 01:11:01.720
You fell for every trap.
Men are so stupid.

01:11:01.722 --> 01:11:03.689
Drop that gun, Phil,
I don't wanna hurt you.

01:11:03.691 --> 01:11:07.563
No, you just wanna use me,
like Sandra used you.

01:11:09.664 --> 01:11:11.163
You don't know
what you're talking about.

01:11:11.165 --> 01:11:12.931
Oh, come on, Jenny.

01:11:12.933 --> 01:11:16.969
She seduced you and married
you just to get to me.

01:11:16.971 --> 01:11:18.570
Shoot him, baby.

01:11:18.572 --> 01:11:21.140
I don't know, babe. It's like, he's not
gonna sprout wings and fly after us.

01:11:21.142 --> 01:11:23.708
I think we should just get on
the plane and take off.

01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:24.911
We're free and clear already.

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:26.679
Jenny, Jenny, listen to me,
listen to me.

01:11:26.681 --> 01:11:29.549
Twelve years ago,
I took an innocent man's life.

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:31.120
That man was Sandra's father.

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:34.086
Oh!

01:11:34.088 --> 01:11:36.488
By the way, I want a divorce.

01:11:36.490 --> 01:11:37.556
Jesus Christ.

01:11:39.593 --> 01:11:44.095
Hey, hey, get your fucking... Hey,
hey, get your hands off of me!

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:50.672
Ahh!

01:11:54.575 --> 01:11:56.641
Fuck, why are you so tiny?

01:11:56.643 --> 01:11:58.211
Hey, what are you guys,
part of a cult?

01:11:58.213 --> 01:12:00.549
This is the job you get when
you don't make Secret Service?

01:12:00.815 --> 01:12:01.984
Phil!

01:12:07.688 --> 01:12:08.887
Come on, fellas.
Let's talk about this.

01:12:08.889 --> 01:12:12.158
Don't do this for that
purple-pubed monster.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:16.028
You're throwing me in a jet-engine? It
shows a real lack of creativity, guys.

01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:17.963
One! Two...

01:12:17.965 --> 01:12:20.099
I hope my fluff sprays
all over your cheap suits.

01:12:20.101 --> 01:12:21.234
Three!

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:23.568
- Bye-bye, puppet.
- Bye-bye, asshole.

01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:27.073
Edwards!

01:12:32.713 --> 01:12:33.981
Edwards!

01:12:40.254 --> 01:12:42.156
- Edwards!
- Phil!

01:12:46.561 --> 01:12:47.993
Come on.

01:12:47.995 --> 01:12:49.931
Give me the key.
She's getting away.

01:12:50.964 --> 01:12:51.967
Shit.

01:12:52.767 --> 01:12:54.634
- Come on. Let's go.
- Thanks.

01:12:54.636 --> 01:12:56.138
My ankle.

01:13:03.611 --> 01:13:06.181
Sandra, where are you?

01:13:07.548 --> 01:13:09.717
Come on. Let's end this thing.

01:13:13.754 --> 01:13:16.622
It's over and you know it.

01:13:16.624 --> 01:13:18.160
Come on out,
you little psycho.

01:13:19.794 --> 01:13:22.164
Drop your gun.

01:13:24.932 --> 01:13:27.099
- Stop right there!
- Oh, what the fuck.

01:13:27.101 --> 01:13:28.634
Edwards! You all right?

01:13:28.636 --> 01:13:30.869
It's deja-fucking-vu, Phil.

01:13:30.871 --> 01:13:34.340
Oh, no, no, no. Ah, fuck me,
it's a gun to the head.

01:13:34.342 --> 01:13:35.808
How'd she get
the drop on you?

01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:37.909
'Cause she's like
a fucking spider monkey.

01:13:37.911 --> 01:13:39.644
Damn! She got me
that way, too.

01:13:39.646 --> 01:13:40.845
Put the gun down!

01:13:40.847 --> 01:13:42.814
Come on, Phil,
don't do this again.

01:13:42.816 --> 01:13:44.050
I don't have a shot.

01:13:44.052 --> 01:13:45.888
Take the shot, Phil.

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:51.090
Just a piece,
just a tiny piece.

01:13:51.092 --> 01:13:53.192
Don't fuck this up.

01:13:53.194 --> 01:13:55.795
You're a puppet, not a fleshy.
Why are you messing with me?

01:13:58.333 --> 01:14:00.699
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, shit! Lyle!

01:14:01.768 --> 01:14:02.902
Oh!

01:14:02.904 --> 01:14:04.869
- Take the shot, Phil!
- He won't shoot me.

01:14:04.871 --> 01:14:07.942
He's a blue loser puppet
with a tiny felt cock!

01:14:22.356 --> 01:14:23.824
Oh, shit.

01:14:25.192 --> 01:14:27.326
Shit, Phil!

01:14:27.328 --> 01:14:30.028
That took you
long enough, but...

01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:31.229
Oh!

01:14:31.231 --> 01:14:33.698
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:36.135
You finally did it, Phily!

01:14:36.137 --> 01:14:37.403
Attaboy!

01:14:37.405 --> 01:14:40.242
That was a nice shot. Fuck.

01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:45.880
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:14:49.150 --> 01:14:50.716
You did good.

01:14:50.718 --> 01:14:52.821
Yeah, you, too, kid.

01:14:54.254 --> 01:14:58.724
God, it's very hard to pull
off all white like that.

01:14:58.726 --> 01:15:00.126
- What?
- I got to give her that.

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:01.993
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Right?

01:15:01.995 --> 01:15:04.195
- Oh, man...
- I'm sorry.

01:15:04.197 --> 01:15:05.665
I'm sorry. Too soon.

01:15:16.878 --> 01:15:19.845
You know, you gave me
quite a scare there.

01:15:19.847 --> 01:15:22.448
I thought
I was gonna lose you.

01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:24.319
Sweetheart, you're never
gonna lose me.

01:15:27.821 --> 01:15:30.124
Bubbles, hey, you know,
I was thinking...

01:15:30.892 --> 01:15:33.292
- You were?
- Yeah.

01:15:33.294 --> 01:15:35.163
They broke the mold
when they made you.

01:15:38.165 --> 01:15:39.998
They did?

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.937
And I'd like to take you out to
dinner, you know, someplace special.

01:15:44.771 --> 01:15:46.173
You mean, like, on a date?

01:15:48.142 --> 01:15:49.177
Yeah.

01:15:50.378 --> 01:15:51.777
Like a date.

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:55.480
I'm gonna go home
and change.

01:15:55.482 --> 01:15:57.917
Oh. All right, okay.

01:15:57.919 --> 01:15:59.855
- Hey, I'll pick you up later.
- Okay.

01:16:03.057 --> 01:16:05.457
- Here you go. Thanks.
- Thank you.

01:16:05.459 --> 01:16:07.760
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

01:16:07.762 --> 01:16:09.828
You finally get the nerve
to ask her out?

01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:12.198
Yeah, I'm gonna take her out
tonight for dinner.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.100
- That took you long enough.
- Mmm.

01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:17.068
Don't fuck this one up, Phil,
she's one of the good ones.

01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:18.403
Yes, she is.

01:16:18.405 --> 01:16:21.774
Good work, you two.
I knew you had it in you.

01:16:21.776 --> 01:16:23.141
Aw, thanks, Lieutenant.

01:16:23.143 --> 01:16:25.243
Edwards,
you're off suspension.

01:16:25.245 --> 01:16:26.045
Thanks, Lieu.

01:16:26.047 --> 01:16:27.947
And, Phil, I talked
to the captain,

01:16:27.949 --> 01:16:30.015
and he put in a motion
with the mayor's office

01:16:30.017 --> 01:16:32.154
to permanently repeal
the Philips Code.

01:16:33.087 --> 01:16:34.220
What?

01:16:35.322 --> 01:16:36.892
I know it's early,

01:16:37.357 --> 01:16:38.524
but what the heck?

01:16:38.526 --> 01:16:41.430
I've had this sitting in my
desk, waiting for this day.

01:16:45.098 --> 01:16:46.332
Wow.

01:16:46.334 --> 01:16:47.402
How about that.

01:16:48.835 --> 01:16:51.103
Far be it from me
to compliment you,

01:16:51.105 --> 01:16:53.238
but you're the best damn cop
I've ever seen.

01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:56.108
Oh, well, you're
no bag of shit either.

01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:58.210
Well, you're a real
fucking poet, aren't you?

01:17:00.213 --> 01:17:01.113
You asshole.

01:17:01.115 --> 01:17:04.250
You are both equally
not bags of shit.

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:08.386
In fact, when you're working together,
you're two peas on a little fucked-up pod.

01:17:08.388 --> 01:17:10.124
Yeah.

01:17:11.092 --> 01:17:12.858
You're the best, partner.

01:17:16.530 --> 01:17:18.396
- God almighty.
- Here we go.

01:17:18.398 --> 01:17:20.265
- Here comes numbnuts.
- Yeah.

01:17:20.267 --> 01:17:24.269
Word on the street is
that you did okay.

01:17:24.271 --> 01:17:27.338
"Okay"? Phil Philips
is a goddamn hero.

01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:31.213
Oh, no, no, no, Edwards is the hero.
I just got a lucky shot off.

01:17:31.545 --> 01:17:32.845
Come on.

01:17:32.847 --> 01:17:34.180
No hard feelings?

01:17:34.182 --> 01:17:37.015
Well, no, I still think
you're an asshole.

01:17:37.017 --> 01:17:38.551
Asshole says what?

01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:40.185
What?

01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:45.024
- I said, "Asshole says what?" And you...
- And you said, "What?"

01:17:45.026 --> 01:17:46.559
- 'Cause you're an asshole.
- Yeah.

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:48.560
What?

01:17:48.562 --> 01:17:49.994
- Every time.
- Yeah.

01:17:49.996 --> 01:17:51.197
Always works on assholes.

01:17:51.199 --> 01:17:52.364
I'm going back
to the FBI.

01:17:52.366 --> 01:17:55.434
Oh, yeah, what's that stand for?
Fucking Big Idiot?

01:17:55.436 --> 01:17:58.837
Oh, wow. What a comeback.
Yeah, that's a reverse burn.

01:17:58.839 --> 01:18:01.006
- Hey, stupid, say "What?"
- What?

01:18:02.476 --> 01:18:05.277
- Fucking big idiot!
- That's not what it stands for!

01:18:06.847 --> 01:18:10.381
