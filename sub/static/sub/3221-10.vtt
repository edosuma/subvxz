WEBVTT

00:03.631 --> 00:06.253
There you are.
You shouldn't have come here, boys.

00:06.467 --> 00:08.175
Meg. She's a demon, Sam.

00:08.386 --> 00:09.928
We're going to heaven, Clarence.

00:12.056 --> 00:16.101
- So, what can you do, you impotent sap?
- What the hell was that thing?

00:16.311 --> 00:18.683
It may have been an Alpha.
An Alpha, like-?

00:18.855 --> 00:21.690
First one who spawned all the others.
Tons of lore about it.

00:21.899 --> 00:24.022
We know you're looking for purgatory.
Why?

00:24.235 --> 00:28.149
Purgatory is vast, underutilized
and hell-adjacent, and I want it.

00:28.364 --> 00:30.820
Bring me creatures.
Aim high on the food chain.

00:31.284 --> 00:33.075
- We ain't your employees.
- You are.

00:33.286 --> 00:36.619
- You're nothing but a crossroads demon.
- Was a crossroads demon.

00:36.831 --> 00:38.409
Now king of hell.

00:38.625 --> 00:40.664
I snap my fingers,
Sam gets his soul back.

00:40.835 --> 00:43.077
Or I shove Sam right back in the hole.

00:48.343 --> 00:52.506
I told you,
I don't know anything about-

00:58.645 --> 01:03.437
Sorry, but your exceptional good looks
aren't gonna buy you any mercy.

01:03.608 --> 01:05.731
I suggest you talk.

01:11.366 --> 01:14.201
What should we use next? Speculum?

01:14.369 --> 01:17.619
- Something more exotic?
- Look, it's purgatory.

01:17.830 --> 01:20.582
All I know is I go there when I die.

01:20.750 --> 01:23.870
- It's not like I can draw you a map.
- I happen to know you can.

01:24.504 --> 01:26.662
- You're wrong.
- My sources are unimpeachable.

01:26.881 --> 01:28.838
You're the father
of your entire species.

01:29.008 --> 01:31.879
You're really not pulling off
this dumb-blond act.

01:33.388 --> 01:36.721
I hope you appreciate
just how much effort I've gone to...

01:36.891 --> 01:40.556
to find something
that can actually hurt you.

01:40.895 --> 01:45.771
Yeah, my tinkering has cost
several lesser shifters their lives.

01:47.110 --> 01:50.561
Iridium. Rarer than hell.

01:50.989 --> 01:53.444
Would have been cheaper
to drop a castle on you.

01:53.616 --> 01:57.116
But I think we all agree. Worth it.

01:57.287 --> 02:01.699
So you start talking...

02:01.874 --> 02:05.374
or I start chopping off
all the bits that stick out.

02:06.629 --> 02:09.120
You go ahead, mate,
see if it makes me-

02:16.472 --> 02:18.512
What was that?

02:19.142 --> 02:21.099
Purgatory's where?

02:22.186 --> 02:25.721
What is it with you animals?

02:28.109 --> 02:30.896
Did I tell you?
This prison has a nursery.

02:32.822 --> 02:35.858
All yours.
I know how much you care about them.

02:36.075 --> 02:39.242
You spent months
gathering them to your bosom.

02:39.454 --> 02:41.612
Not so cocky now, are we?

02:41.831 --> 02:44.500
Finding purgatory's important to me.

02:45.793 --> 02:48.794
You have five seconds
to tell me where it is.

02:48.963 --> 02:55.630
After that, I'll fillet them in front
of you, toss their spines in your lap.

02:55.803 --> 02:59.007
Four, three, two-

02:59.223 --> 03:01.549
Kill them all. We'll make more.

03:16.699 --> 03:19.155
Guess I kind of lost my head.

03:56.114 --> 03:58.735
Let's go. Come on.

04:01.869 --> 04:04.195
- You're late.
- Traffic was a bitch.

04:05.999 --> 04:08.406
- One Rougarou.
- Now, where's Crowley?

04:08.584 --> 04:11.076
Banging a hooker in a sweet spot
called none of your business.

04:11.254 --> 04:14.919
Oh! Look at that, Sam,
demon trying to be funny.

04:15.091 --> 04:17.664
- Oh, is that what just happened?
- Night, girls.

04:17.844 --> 04:21.509
Wait, wait, hold up, hold up.
Are we ever gonna see Crowley again...

04:21.680 --> 04:24.172
or is he just gonna keep sending
his demon extras?

04:24.350 --> 04:25.809
Sorry, I know you're speaking.

04:25.977 --> 04:28.302
I see your lips moving,
but I can't understand...

04:28.479 --> 04:30.437
because I don't speak little bitch.

04:49.834 --> 04:52.159
Remember when
we used to gank demons?

04:54.464 --> 04:56.587
No, man, screw it. I'm done.

04:56.758 --> 04:59.046
- Calm down.
- We've been going on these runs...

04:59.218 --> 05:01.377
- and it's not getting us anywhere.
- Dean-

05:01.554 --> 05:05.255
The only thing that's really changed
is now I need a daily rape shower.

05:05.433 --> 05:08.185
Okay, you're right.
Let's go with plan B.

05:08.353 --> 05:09.681
Oh, yeah, we don't have one.

05:10.396 --> 05:13.516
So till we do, sorry, dude,
stock up on soap on a rope.

05:16.903 --> 05:19.820
If you wanna get my soul back,
that's what we gotta do, okay?

05:20.031 --> 05:21.655
Yeah.

05:22.992 --> 05:24.190
You even want it back?

05:26.913 --> 05:28.905
I'm working for Crowley, aren't I?

05:32.669 --> 05:36.916
Yeah, well, who says
he's gonna hold up his end, you know?

05:37.090 --> 05:39.378
It is Crowley.

05:39.550 --> 05:43.382
You ever think of that? Right?

05:45.515 --> 05:48.432
So I guess the moment's over.
Is that what you're saying?

05:51.020 --> 05:52.183
Sam?

06:28.641 --> 06:30.515
What now?

06:31.019 --> 06:32.513
I think I know who you can ask.

06:35.481 --> 06:37.106
Evil bitch.

06:37.275 --> 06:41.059
Keep sweet-talking me.
This could go a whole new direction.

06:41.237 --> 06:43.906
Meg. I've been dying to see you again.

06:44.407 --> 06:46.696
Well, here I am, big boy.

06:46.868 --> 06:48.907
So, what should we do now?

06:49.078 --> 06:52.697
- How about I rip you to shreds?
- Kinky, I like.

06:52.874 --> 06:56.077
But a little Q&A first, if you don't mind.
Now, where's your boss?

06:58.004 --> 07:00.673
- You think we work for somebody?
- I happen to know for a fact...

07:00.840 --> 07:02.998
you've been juggling
Crowley's orphans.

07:03.176 --> 07:06.794
- Now, where is he?
- Don't know, don't care.

07:07.263 --> 07:09.339
But you've been working his beat
for months.

07:09.515 --> 07:11.140
Doesn't mean we get face time.

07:22.028 --> 07:24.815
Where does he take all those things
you snatch up for him?

07:25.239 --> 07:29.486
I bet you an all-day sucker
that's where His Majesty's holed up.

07:31.496 --> 07:35.790
Okay, officially over the foreplay.
Satisfy me or I please myself.

07:37.627 --> 07:39.251
Something funny, Sam? Yeah.

07:39.754 --> 07:41.830
- Meg.
- Really? Because where I'm sitting-

07:42.048 --> 07:44.005
Don't worry, she can't do jack squat.

07:44.884 --> 07:46.877
- She's totally screwed.
- Sam, not helping.

07:47.095 --> 07:49.586
Look at her, Dean. She's furious.

07:49.806 --> 07:52.475
If she could kill you,
she'd have done it by now.

07:53.226 --> 07:55.135
She's running.

07:57.188 --> 07:58.433
Am I?

07:58.648 --> 08:01.565
Judging by the level of flop sweat
on all of you, yeah.

08:01.734 --> 08:05.234
Which means you're running
from Crowley, which makes sense.

08:05.405 --> 08:07.777
Crowley would wanna hunt down
Lucifer loyalists...

08:07.949 --> 08:09.609
now that he's big man on campus.

08:09.784 --> 08:11.444
How would you know?

08:13.288 --> 08:15.327
It's what I'd do.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.790
She can't kill us.

08:20.003 --> 08:24.499
She needs us to get her to Crowley
so she can stick that knife in his neck.

08:24.674 --> 08:28.458
- It's him or her.
- Well, I hope you both lose.

08:28.845 --> 08:30.043
But good luck.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.636
So you know
what you gotta do now, right?

08:32.807 --> 08:35.642
- Let me guess, you're gonna tell me.
- Work with us.

08:35.852 --> 08:38.224
Whoa, what?

08:38.395 --> 08:41.682
We'll hand you Crowley with a bow
on one condition.

08:42.232 --> 08:44.938
We go with you, you help us
wring something out of him...

08:45.111 --> 08:46.605
before you hack him to bits.

08:46.779 --> 08:48.439
What? Doesn't matter.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.654
Question is,
can you get us what we need?

08:50.825 --> 08:53.696
I apprenticed under Alastair in hell
just like your brother.

08:53.870 --> 08:56.740
So, Dean, can I make Crowley
do whatever I want?

08:59.792 --> 09:01.037
Yeah, she can.

09:02.378 --> 09:05.379
It's a deal then.
Hugs and puppies all around.

09:05.798 --> 09:08.005
You gonna untie us?

09:08.843 --> 09:12.426
Please, don't pretend
you don't enjoy it.

09:23.066 --> 09:24.939
Are you gonna kiss me?

09:25.568 --> 09:26.979
Come on.

09:35.203 --> 09:38.868
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

09:39.040 --> 09:40.451
I mean, what are you doing?

09:41.876 --> 09:43.703
Dean, you wanted
to screw over Crowley.

09:43.878 --> 09:46.084
Merry Christmas.

09:46.798 --> 09:48.790
- What?
- You wanna work with a demon again?

09:48.967 --> 09:50.425
We're working with demons now.

09:50.593 --> 09:53.594
- I'm doing this because I wanna stop.
- She killed Ellen and Jo.

09:53.763 --> 09:56.301
But you can't look at this emotionally.
We need her.

09:56.516 --> 09:58.888
The hell we do.
That bitch is gonna screw us-

09:59.102 --> 10:01.260
Of course,
which is why we'll screw her first.

10:02.021 --> 10:04.691
Meg and her little posse are dead
the second we're done.

10:04.899 --> 10:06.808
- If they don't kill us.
- Oh, they won't.

10:07.026 --> 10:08.818
Because we're bringing insurance.

10:20.498 --> 10:22.455
Castiel.

10:23.001 --> 10:26.251
We need you. It's important.

10:33.261 --> 10:35.633
Cass, we found something.

10:35.805 --> 10:38.841
It's this gold box.

10:39.017 --> 10:41.305
Apparently, Nazis were after it
back in the day.

10:41.477 --> 10:43.933
Someone tried to open it
and their face melted off.

10:44.105 --> 10:46.098
We think it's, uh...

10:46.274 --> 10:47.733
Ready for this?

10:47.900 --> 10:52.859
The Ark of the Covenant. Yeah.

10:53.031 --> 10:55.948
So-I'm here, Sam.

10:57.493 --> 10:58.904
Where is the box?

10:59.871 --> 11:01.780
I can't believe you fell for that.

11:01.998 --> 11:04.074
<i>That was the plot of Raiders, idiot.</i>

11:04.709 --> 11:06.500
I'm mid-battle, Sam.

11:06.669 --> 11:09.291
I could give a rat's ass
about your match with Raphael.

11:09.464 --> 11:10.709
- Listen-
- No, you listen.

11:10.924 --> 11:13.296
I don't care what you're dealing with.
You owe me.

11:13.468 --> 11:15.211
You may not care, but believe me-

11:15.386 --> 11:18.257
- You think we're here to talk this out?
- Sam, I can't just-

11:18.431 --> 11:22.678
If you don't help us,
I will hunt you down and kill you.

11:24.145 --> 11:27.894
Will you, boy?

11:28.066 --> 11:30.521
- How?
- I don't know yet.

11:30.693 --> 11:34.311
But I will look until I find out,
and I don't sleep.

11:36.157 --> 11:39.407
- You need help, Sam.
- I need your help.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.742
You actually showed.

11:47.919 --> 11:52.213
Wow, Sam, I owe you a chicken dinner.
What happened?

11:52.382 --> 11:55.881
No big.
This is what friends do for each other.

12:03.768 --> 12:04.847
It's not working.

12:06.229 --> 12:08.601
Crowley's hidden from me.

12:09.399 --> 12:12.316
Well, looks like we're gonna have to
try this the hard way.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.256
Can I help you?

12:45.934 --> 12:49.054
- What do you want?
- We wanna know where Crowley is.

12:49.229 --> 12:51.056
If I even knew, why would I tell you?

12:51.231 --> 12:53.307
Because you're our grandfather.

12:53.525 --> 12:56.443
Samuel, I'm gonna get my soul back.

12:56.612 --> 12:58.688
- Who says you can get it back?
- Me.

12:59.198 --> 13:02.282
- I'd like to help, but I'm sorry.
- This is your grandson's soul.

13:02.451 --> 13:03.482
I can't.

13:04.661 --> 13:08.908
What is wrong with you?
You wanna work for Crowley?

13:11.126 --> 13:12.953
Cass, can you give us a minute?

13:19.551 --> 13:21.461
We're your blood.

13:21.970 --> 13:24.758
But if you don't wanna help us,
I can't make you.

13:24.932 --> 13:26.260
But I just gotta know why.

13:27.893 --> 13:30.645
What is Crowley holding over you?
You owe us that.

13:51.625 --> 13:55.539
- Mom?
- He's gonna give her back to me.

13:57.881 --> 14:01.416
- Crowley's gonna bring Mom back?
- You tell me you don't want her back.

14:07.725 --> 14:09.883
You know the one difference
between us?

14:11.186 --> 14:13.144
You know how to live without her.

14:16.108 --> 14:18.599
Look, I know how you feel.
No, you don't.

14:20.404 --> 14:25.362
She's my daughter, and she's dead.
And I can do something about it.

14:25.576 --> 14:29.194
- You think Crowley's gonna make good?
- He brought Sam back and me.

14:29.663 --> 14:32.581
Trust me. Don't go down that road.

14:32.958 --> 14:35.876
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying stop trying.

14:37.004 --> 14:38.546
It's gonna go nowhere good.

14:40.007 --> 14:45.001
Samuel, I know we've had
our differences, but I'm your grandson.

14:45.179 --> 14:49.046
And I'm telling you
that this is wrong for so many reasons.

14:49.266 --> 14:52.137
- You hypocrite.
- I'm asking you learn from our mistakes.

14:53.771 --> 14:57.603
Doing this, this is how the bad guy
gets us every time. It's our Achilles heel.

14:57.816 --> 14:59.856
Apparently, it runs in the family.

15:06.784 --> 15:09.785
We will figure
something else out, okay?

15:11.747 --> 15:14.748
- I'm sorry, Dean, but-
- Fine.

15:14.917 --> 15:17.372
Fine, you bring her back.

15:17.544 --> 15:19.454
But what are you gonna tell her, huh?

15:19.672 --> 15:21.830
Gonna tell her
you made a deal with a demon?

15:22.049 --> 15:25.382
- That you wouldn't help out her sons?
- All right, that's enough.

15:29.139 --> 15:31.013
Just get out.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.745
It's very complex.

15:59.002 --> 16:00.283
Mm-hm.

16:00.754 --> 16:04.799
If the pizza man
truly loves this babysitter...

16:05.676 --> 16:08.463
why does he keep slapping her rear?

16:08.637 --> 16:09.835
Ow!

16:10.055 --> 16:12.629
Perhaps she's done something wrong.

16:14.393 --> 16:16.599
You're watching porn?

16:17.146 --> 16:19.138
- Why?
- It was there.

16:21.650 --> 16:25.066
You don't watch porn
in a room full of dudes.

16:25.279 --> 16:28.280
And you don't talk about it.

16:28.449 --> 16:29.563
Just turn it off.

16:34.455 --> 16:36.696
Oh, now he's got a boner.

16:59.063 --> 17:02.645
This what you boys do?
Sit around watching pornos with angels?

17:02.816 --> 17:05.271
We're not supposed to talk about it.

17:08.864 --> 17:10.987
Why are you here, Samuel?

17:11.909 --> 17:14.196
It's what Mary would want.

17:15.037 --> 17:17.409
Now, this is what I know.

17:17.580 --> 17:21.448
Whatever we bag ends up there.

17:22.086 --> 17:24.955
That's where he tortures,
interrogates them, I don't know.

17:25.172 --> 17:27.627
Only been outside the place,
but it's a death trap.

17:28.258 --> 17:30.417
Nothing gets in
that Crowley doesn't want in.

17:30.594 --> 17:33.346
- And nothing gets out, period.
- Well, thanks.

17:35.599 --> 17:37.141
I wish you wouldn't do this.

17:39.603 --> 17:41.726
Come with us.

17:46.568 --> 17:49.238
I may be soft, but I'm not suicidal.

18:05.796 --> 18:09.580
Remember me?
I sure remember you, Clarence.

18:09.800 --> 18:13.549
Why are we working
with these abominations?

18:13.762 --> 18:16.218
Keep talking dirty.
It makes my meat suit all dewy.

18:16.390 --> 18:18.050
All right, simmer down.

18:18.267 --> 18:21.102
- We know where Crowley is.
- Great, do tell.

18:21.311 --> 18:23.553
Tell you
so you can just leave us for dead.

18:23.772 --> 18:26.857
You boys have serious
abandonment issues, you know that?

18:27.026 --> 18:28.306
We'll show you, all right?

18:28.527 --> 18:31.362
- But we're going together.
- I'm just supposed to trust you?

18:31.572 --> 18:33.114
No, you're not that stupid.

18:35.826 --> 18:38.032
- Give me the knife.
- No, I'm not that stupid.

18:38.203 --> 18:40.741
Do you want us
to take you to Crowley or not?

18:59.099 --> 19:03.227
You saw him. He was more interested
in killing us than getting the job done.

19:03.395 --> 19:05.269
I just did all of us a favor.

19:10.235 --> 19:13.936
Hey. You just gonna keep that?

19:15.157 --> 19:18.608
You took this from us.
I'm taking it back.

19:18.786 --> 19:21.111
We leave in one hour.

19:58.534 --> 20:00.859
You know, Cass, you could help.

20:03.789 --> 20:06.790
I'm ambivalent
about what we're attempting.

20:07.960 --> 20:11.411
Breaking into monster Gitmo is not
a two-for-one in the champagne room.

20:11.588 --> 20:16.085
I'm not sure
retrieving Sam's soul is wise.

20:20.139 --> 20:22.048
Wait, what? Why?

20:22.474 --> 20:24.266
I want him to survive.

20:26.437 --> 20:28.394
What are you talking about?

20:31.734 --> 20:35.566
Sam's soul
has been locked in the cage...

20:35.738 --> 20:39.403
with Michael and Lucifer
for more than a year...

20:39.575 --> 20:43.359
and they have nothing to do
but take their frustrations out on him.

20:43.579 --> 20:45.655
Do you understand?

20:46.665 --> 20:50.829
If we try to force that mutilated thing
down Sam's gullet...

20:51.003 --> 20:52.746
we have no idea what will happen.

20:52.921 --> 20:54.297
It could be catastrophic.

20:54.506 --> 20:56.380
- You mean he dies.
- I mean he doesn't.

20:57.551 --> 21:00.920
Paralysis, insanity,
psychic pain so profound...

21:01.096 --> 21:04.714
that he's locked inside himself
for the rest of his life.

21:05.392 --> 21:09.176
But you're saying you don't know
anything for sure. He could be fine.

21:09.355 --> 21:10.849
- He could be, yes.
- Okay, then.

21:11.023 --> 21:12.766
But I sincerely doubt it.

21:13.442 --> 21:15.850
Well, if he's not fine then you fix him.

21:16.028 --> 21:20.357
- Dean, I wouldn't know where to begin.
- Then you figure it out, Cass. Come on.

21:21.158 --> 21:23.151
I mean, the guy's a frigging replicant.

21:23.327 --> 21:24.655
He needs his soul.

21:30.209 --> 21:33.909
Look, we get it back,
and if there are complications...

21:34.088 --> 21:37.089
then we will figure out
a way to deal with those too.

21:37.883 --> 21:39.923
Of course.

21:45.349 --> 21:50.390
Or we fail,
and Sam suffers horrifically.

22:08.539 --> 22:10.496
Seems pretty quiet.

22:11.125 --> 22:14.576
It's not. I can feel it.

22:14.753 --> 22:16.662
Meet me at the side door.

22:20.676 --> 22:24.887
- This all seem a little too easy to you?
- Way too easy.

23:01.592 --> 23:03.549
Is someone there?

23:03.719 --> 23:07.218
Please. Please, help me.

23:10.017 --> 23:11.476
You gotta get me out of here.

23:13.687 --> 23:16.309
Please. You gotta get me out of here.

23:18.233 --> 23:20.226
Come on, Dean. We gotta move.

23:33.916 --> 23:35.244
Wait.

23:35.876 --> 23:37.785
What is it?

23:43.467 --> 23:45.625
Damn it. Here come the guards.

23:49.598 --> 23:51.306
Hellhounds.

23:58.484 --> 24:00.109
Go.

24:14.333 --> 24:15.448
I knew this was a trap.

24:16.043 --> 24:18.961
- What do you want, a cupcake?
- That should keep them out.

24:19.172 --> 24:21.544
- Not for long. How many are there?
- Lots.

24:21.716 --> 24:24.503
- I'll be pulling for you from Cleveland.
- What?

24:24.677 --> 24:27.085
I didn't know this was gonna happen.
Bright side?

24:27.305 --> 24:30.471
Them chewing up my meat suit
ought to buy you a few seconds.

24:30.683 --> 24:32.676
Seacrest out.

24:40.860 --> 24:43.315
It's a spell, I think, from Crowley.

24:43.488 --> 24:46.239
Within these walls,
you're locked inside your body.

24:46.407 --> 24:47.985
Karma's a bitch, bitch.

24:52.622 --> 24:56.073
What are you gonna do, you gonna slash
thin air until you hit something?

24:56.834 --> 24:58.993
You can see them.
Take this, hold them off.

24:59.212 --> 25:01.085
It's our best shot.

25:01.756 --> 25:04.425
At Crowley. Take it and go.

25:04.634 --> 25:07.255
You kill the smarmy dick.
I'll hold off the dogs.

25:07.470 --> 25:09.877
Well, how are you gonna do that-?

25:29.325 --> 25:31.282
What was that?

25:33.955 --> 25:35.947
I learned that from the pizza man.

25:37.041 --> 25:41.288
Well, A-plus for you. I feel so clean.

25:44.507 --> 25:47.674
- Okay. Gotta go.
- Is that gonna work on a hellhound?

25:47.885 --> 25:50.174
Well, we're about to find out. Run.

26:22.211 --> 26:24.418
I can't see jack.

26:29.802 --> 26:31.629
- Cass?
- Dean.

26:34.432 --> 26:36.092
You sold us out?

26:39.312 --> 26:41.767
- Damn you, Samuel.
- Yes.

26:41.939 --> 26:46.400
And I have to say, best purchase
I've made since Dick Cheney.

26:46.611 --> 26:49.066
Hi, Crowley, how's tricks?

26:49.238 --> 26:51.361
Above your pay grade.

26:51.532 --> 26:53.691
Been working. Big things.

26:53.868 --> 26:57.818
- Alas, you'll be too dead to participate.
- Really?

26:57.997 --> 27:00.203
Shame I have to do away
with you both.

27:00.416 --> 27:03.666
Rather enjoyed
your indentured servitude.

27:47.547 --> 27:50.750
Sam? Yeah?

27:53.970 --> 27:55.547
I'm standing in pee.

27:58.724 --> 28:00.053
Consider yourself lucky.

28:01.185 --> 28:02.383
Yikes.

28:03.146 --> 28:04.937
That sucks.

28:09.861 --> 28:12.731
You want forgiveness, find a priest.

28:12.905 --> 28:17.532
- I just want you to understand-
- Oh, I understand that you're a liar.

28:17.702 --> 28:21.616
You talk about putting blood first, which
is funny, you sound just like my dad.

28:21.789 --> 28:24.624
- Difference is, he actually did.
- I am putting blood first.

28:24.834 --> 28:26.957
- Oh, give me a break.
- Mary's my blood.

28:27.128 --> 28:30.746
My daughter.
Don't come at me like I sold you out.

28:30.965 --> 28:33.456
You sold out your own mother.
It was her or Sam...

28:33.676 --> 28:35.503
and you chose Sam,
plain and simple.

28:35.720 --> 28:38.293
Oh, that is such crap.
You wanna know what happened?

28:38.514 --> 28:40.970
You chose a demon
over your own grandsons.

28:42.810 --> 28:44.470
See it how you want.

28:46.564 --> 28:50.265
I don't even know what Sam is.
And you want me to protect him?

28:50.485 --> 28:52.358
And you?

28:53.654 --> 28:56.608
You're a stranger. No, really, tell me.

28:56.782 --> 28:59.819
What exactly
are you supposed to be to me?

29:00.953 --> 29:02.198
I'll tell you who I am.

29:03.789 --> 29:06.459
I'm the guy
you never wanna see again.

29:07.251 --> 29:09.956
Because I'll make it out of here,
trust me.

29:11.172 --> 29:14.872
The next time you see me,
I'll be there to kill you.

29:18.554 --> 29:20.511
Don't think
there's gonna be a next time.

29:20.681 --> 29:22.555
Whatever gets you through the night.

29:47.542 --> 29:50.377
Get off me. Get off!

30:04.851 --> 30:09.845
So Crowley wants to know...

30:10.022 --> 30:12.893
Well, everything.

30:13.109 --> 30:15.267
He told me to carve it out of you.

30:15.444 --> 30:17.603
Whatever makes you feel like a man.

30:21.242 --> 30:24.113
Ha, ha.

30:25.371 --> 30:27.660
You talk a mean game.

30:28.833 --> 30:30.410
But, uh...

30:33.087 --> 30:34.629
you're scared.

31:46.118 --> 31:47.945
Enjoy.

31:51.415 --> 31:54.251
<i>All right, all right,
Shawshank is a great flick...</i>

31:54.418 --> 31:56.577
but let's skip
the shower scene, huh?

31:56.754 --> 31:59.423
Look. Breakfast.

32:09.016 --> 32:11.389
What did you do with my brother?

32:11.561 --> 32:15.475
Oh, you'll find out.
You're about to join him.

32:38.671 --> 32:39.916
Freaking hate ghouls.

32:41.215 --> 32:44.667
Dean?
Let me go, you son of a bitch!

32:44.844 --> 32:46.587
Dean.

33:13.623 --> 33:17.490
You know, you're sticking that thing
in all the wrong places.

33:18.461 --> 33:20.121
Really?

33:20.922 --> 33:23.294
You sure were squealing.

33:23.966 --> 33:27.051
Knock yourself out. It's a host body.

33:27.220 --> 33:31.087
Some girl from Sheboygan,
moved to L.A. to be an actress.

33:31.265 --> 33:35.133
It's probably not even the worst thing
that ever happened to her.

33:49.158 --> 33:51.032
What are you laughing at?

33:53.371 --> 33:56.704
Dean Winchester's behind you,
meat sack.

34:04.632 --> 34:06.292
We should go.

34:22.984 --> 34:24.940
Hello, sweetheart.

34:25.110 --> 34:27.684
Feeling chatty this morning, are we?

34:33.202 --> 34:35.076
Do hope so.

34:36.746 --> 34:40.033
Wouldn't want to harm a hair
on that pretty little head.

34:40.208 --> 34:44.206
So you ready to tell me
all about your daddy?

34:51.262 --> 34:53.005
Hold that thought.

35:10.615 --> 35:12.358
You should be ghoul scat by now.

35:22.460 --> 35:24.002
Really necessary?

35:25.588 --> 35:27.047
I just had this dry-cleaned.

35:32.220 --> 35:34.841
So to what do I owe
the reach around?

35:38.851 --> 35:40.180
Crowley.

35:41.604 --> 35:43.312
Whore.

35:43.481 --> 35:45.308
Okay. You know what?

35:46.609 --> 35:49.563
The best torturers
never get their hands dirty.

35:49.737 --> 35:51.481
Sam wants a word with you.

35:53.074 --> 35:55.150
What can I do for you, Sam?

35:55.326 --> 35:58.327
You know damn well.
I want my soul back.

35:59.455 --> 36:02.954
And here I thought
you just grew some balls, Sam.

36:03.709 --> 36:05.085
Well?

36:06.337 --> 36:07.500
- No.
- Meg?

36:17.557 --> 36:19.549
- I can't.
- Can't or won't?

36:19.767 --> 36:23.468
I said can't, and I meant can't,
you mop-headed lumberjack.

36:24.522 --> 36:26.396
I was lucky
to get this much of you out.

36:27.024 --> 36:28.898
Going back in there
for the sloppy bits?

36:29.068 --> 36:32.519
I'm good, but those two in there?
Forget it.

36:32.738 --> 36:34.980
- How do I know you're not lying?
- You don't.

36:35.158 --> 36:38.158
But it doesn't change anything.
I'm telling you.

36:38.578 --> 36:42.871
Sam,
why do you want the thing back?

36:44.250 --> 36:47.868
Satan's got one juicy source
of entertainment in there.

36:48.504 --> 36:52.372
I'd swallow a rag off a bathhouse floor
before I took that soul.

36:52.550 --> 36:55.966
Unless you want to be
a drooling mess.

36:56.179 --> 37:00.128
- Sam, I hate to say it, but he's right.
- Yeah, right, I get it, thanks.

37:01.642 --> 37:02.674
He's all yours.

37:02.852 --> 37:05.307
- Are you crazy? He's our only hope.
- You heard him.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.187
He can't get it. He's useless.

37:20.244 --> 37:22.036
You'll let me back out, right?

37:27.335 --> 37:29.956
This is for Lucifer, you pompous little-

37:38.262 --> 37:40.054
That's better.

37:44.352 --> 37:47.436
You don't know torture,
you little insect.

37:48.231 --> 37:50.140
Leave them alone.

37:50.691 --> 37:52.649
Castiel.

37:52.860 --> 37:55.945
Haven't seen you all season.
You the cavalry now?

37:56.155 --> 37:59.322
Put the knife down.
You that bossy in heaven?

37:59.867 --> 38:01.611
Hear you're losing out to Raphael.

38:02.370 --> 38:05.371
The whole affair makes Vietnam
look like a roller derby.

38:07.416 --> 38:09.374
Hey, what's in the gift bag?

38:10.753 --> 38:12.544
You are.

38:15.466 --> 38:17.293
Not possible.

38:17.718 --> 38:20.470
You didn't hide your bones
as well as you should have.

38:28.020 --> 38:29.680
Cookie for you.

38:29.856 --> 38:32.643
Can you restore Sam's soul or not?

38:38.781 --> 38:41.403
If I can help out in any other-

38:41.617 --> 38:42.732
Answer him.

38:50.001 --> 38:51.199
I can't.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.615
Well, she's smart. I'll give her that.

39:30.829 --> 39:32.822
I was gonna kill her too.

39:33.415 --> 39:36.120
Of course,
I'd have given you an hour with her first.

39:37.544 --> 39:39.537
Why would I want that?

39:42.633 --> 39:46.251
Thanks, Cass.
If it hadn't have been for you...

39:49.223 --> 39:53.635
Crowley was right.
It's not going well for me upstairs.

39:55.812 --> 39:58.517
- If there's anything we can do-
- There isn't.

39:59.525 --> 40:02.360
I wish circumstances were different.

40:03.070 --> 40:06.106
Much of the time, I'd rather be here.

40:06.532 --> 40:08.820
We know you got a steaming pile
on your plate.

40:08.992 --> 40:12.159
There's no need for apologies.
We're your friends.

40:14.081 --> 40:16.998
Listen, Sam. We'll find another way.

40:17.209 --> 40:18.454
You really wanna help?

40:20.170 --> 40:22.377
Prison full of monsters.

40:22.548 --> 40:25.502
Can't just leave them,
can't let them go.

40:25.968 --> 40:27.877
I understand.

40:32.057 --> 40:34.014
He's right, you know.

40:34.685 --> 40:36.227
About?

40:37.187 --> 40:40.521
About your soul.
We'll figure something else out.

40:40.691 --> 40:43.182
- No, we won't.
- Oh, why, because Crowley said-

40:43.360 --> 40:46.943
You heard what Crowley said.
And I heard what Cass said.

40:47.155 --> 40:49.528
Putting this thing back in
would smash me to bits.

40:49.741 --> 40:51.900
- We don't know that for sure.
- You know what?

40:52.077 --> 40:54.485
When angels and demons
agree on something...

40:54.663 --> 40:56.288
call me nuts, I pay attention.

40:56.456 --> 40:57.999
You say this now?

40:58.166 --> 41:01.666
- After we practically died trying to-
- We almost got ourselves killed.

41:01.879 --> 41:05.045
I mean, how many times
do we risk our asses for this?

41:05.215 --> 41:08.086
Enough's enough.
I don't think I want it back.

41:08.302 --> 41:10.590
You don't even know
what you're saying.

41:10.762 --> 41:12.802
No, I'm saying something
you don't like.

41:15.142 --> 41:19.471
You obviously care a lot. But I think
maybe I'm better off without it.

41:19.646 --> 41:22.102
You're wrong.
You don't know how wrong you are.

41:22.274 --> 41:24.101
I'm not sure about that.

41:25.903 --> 41:27.895
Sam, don't walk away.

41:28.071 --> 41:29.696
Sam.

41:29.865 --> 41:31.489
Sam.
