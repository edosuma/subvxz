[dramatic music]

00:04.472 --> 00:10.211
*

00:10.244 --> 00:12.480
- My name is Steve Grosvenor.
I am 49.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.448
There's never been a mastersmith
in South Dakota,

00:14.482 --> 00:16.217
and I'm hoping to be the first.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.319
I believe I have found
my calling,

00:18.352 --> 00:21.622
because I love being
the caveman-hammerman guy.

00:21.655 --> 00:23.524
And that ain't lying.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.694
- My name is Ryan Rowe.
I am 31 years old.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.397
I believe that all of my work
has a spirit,

00:29.430 --> 00:31.199
has a unique soul.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.666
It's almost
like birthing a baby.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.535
Every baby's gonna come out
different.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.270
- [hoarsely]
My name is Mark Green.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.172
I'm 61 years old.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.607
I woke up the day
I had to come here,

00:39.640 --> 00:41.142
and I had no voice.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.476
But...

00:47.848 --> 00:50.584
- My name's Tyler Mandgie.
I'm a professional farrier.

00:50.618 --> 00:53.321
I grew up on the ocean,
and I try to surf every day.

00:53.354 --> 00:55.356
I've always gone to surf
contests.

00:55.389 --> 00:58.226
And knife making has turned
into the same as to where

00:58.259 --> 01:01.329
I want to be better than anybody
who's around me.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.564
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the Forge.

01:03.597 --> 01:07.135
You're here to engage in three
rounds of edged-weapon-making

01:07.168 --> 01:09.403
competition all in the hopes of
winning the title

01:09.437 --> 01:11.205
of "Forged in Fire" champion

01:11.239 --> 01:13.141
and a check for $10,000.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.209
Let's go ahead and meet your
judges now.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.878
ABS mastersmith J. Neilson,

01:17.911 --> 01:20.648
historical weapons re-creation
specialist David Baker,

01:20.681 --> 01:23.817
edged weapon specialist
Doug Marcaida.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.686
In this first round
of competition,

01:25.719 --> 01:28.456
you're gonna have to forge
your signature blades

01:28.489 --> 01:29.390
from this material...

01:29.423 --> 01:31.225
*

01:31.259 --> 01:32.193
Salvaged steel.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.295
*

01:34.328 --> 01:35.896
- I am so upset,

01:35.929 --> 01:38.166
because it's all a bunch of
junkyard garbage

01:38.199 --> 01:41.469
that I know is hard to
heat-treat and get hard.

01:41.502 --> 01:45.839
- We've got bicycle chain,
chain saw chain, cable wire,

01:45.873 --> 01:49.810
spud wrench, lawnmower blade,
railroad spike,

01:49.843 --> 01:53.247
farrier file,
and jackhammer bits.

01:53.281 --> 01:56.150
You must also include a visual
element from whatever steel

01:56.184 --> 01:58.652
you choose
into your blade's design.

01:58.686 --> 02:01.455
The judges need to be able to
see what steel was used

02:01.489 --> 02:03.857
to make the blade just by
looking at it.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.926
Keep in mind that in the second
round, you'll be putting handles

02:05.959 --> 02:08.396
on your blades to turn them into
fully functional weapons

02:08.429 --> 02:10.498
that will then be tested for
strength and durability

02:10.531 --> 02:12.566
in an ice block chop

02:12.600 --> 02:16.270
and for edge retention
in a rope slice.

02:16.304 --> 02:19.407
In an order chosen at random
before you entered the Forge,

02:19.440 --> 02:22.210
you will now come forward and
choose one of the steels.

02:22.243 --> 02:25.379
Each item can only be selected
by one contestant.

02:25.413 --> 02:28.349
- As a farrier, I'd like to
work with the farrier's rasps.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.451
I hope nobody wants those.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.852
- Ryan, you're up first.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.921
Please choose your steel.

02:33.954 --> 02:37.725
- I have free reign over
anything on that table.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.360
I choose the jackhammer bits,

02:39.393 --> 02:41.229
because in terms
of edge retention,

02:41.262 --> 02:42.930
they take a lot of abuse,

02:42.963 --> 02:44.732
and I don't think I have
anything to worry about

02:44.765 --> 02:45.766
in terms of heat-treating it.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.935
- Mark, you're up next.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.204
*

02:50.238 --> 02:51.439
- [bleep].

02:51.472 --> 02:52.506
He took my damn rasps.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.342
- Tyler, you're up next.

02:54.375 --> 02:57.311
- I had no backup plan at all,

02:57.345 --> 03:00.314
so I grabbed something that
looked like a knife already--

03:00.348 --> 03:01.715
the spud wrench.

03:01.749 --> 03:02.850
Ugh.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.785
- Steve, you're last.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.820
Choose your steel.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.323
- I was hoping for cable.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.292
Even though cable is very
difficult to work with,

03:11.325 --> 03:13.661
I've used it before,

03:13.694 --> 03:15.663
so at least I got a shot.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.665
- You will have ten minutes
to work on your designs.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.767
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.569
Good luck, bladesmiths.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.771
Your ten-minute design window
starts now.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.640
[rock music]

03:26.674 --> 03:29.410
Let's talk
about that visual element

03:29.443 --> 03:32.580
that lets us know what reclaimed
material they used.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.549
- This is one of those things
you really have lan ahead.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.818
You can't just wing it, because
you could just go into

03:37.851 --> 03:41.622
knife-making mode and totally
grind out whatever visual

03:41.655 --> 03:44.658
element you were
supposed to have.

03:44.692 --> 03:47.027
- I'm designing a recurved
bolo-style blade,

03:47.060 --> 03:49.463
because the bolo design--

03:49.497 --> 03:51.799
a little bit heavy
on the front end for chopping

03:51.832 --> 03:55.002
that's tapered back
into a nice thin cutting knife.

03:55.035 --> 03:58.906
I recently completed my
journeyman bladesmith rating.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.875
I feel a lot more comfortable
in my skills.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.277
That's all the stamp.

04:03.311 --> 04:04.712
They just give you the stamp,

04:04.745 --> 04:05.879
and right away
you have the skills.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.715
[laughs]

04:07.748 --> 04:09.683
- Because I picked
the spud wrench,

04:09.717 --> 04:11.685
I'm going to make
a tanto blade.

04:11.719 --> 04:14.288
The spud wrench is already
in the shape of a tanto,

04:14.322 --> 04:16.657
and I'm gonna keep the profile
that it came with.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.726
I know exactly what part
of the wrench

04:18.759 --> 04:20.794
I'm gonna incorporate
into my blade,

04:20.828 --> 04:23.631
the little turny-knob deal...

04:23.664 --> 04:25.433
for lack of a better term.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.468
[rock music]

04:27.501 --> 04:28.936
- I think my biggest strength
in blade making

04:28.969 --> 04:31.472
is my knowledge
of historical lades.

04:31.505 --> 04:34.742
So I'm designing a straight-up
broad seax.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.010
The rasp is probably the most
simple thing

04:37.044 --> 04:39.046
to keep the
element in the blade.

04:39.079 --> 04:42.350
I don't get nervous about
things very often.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.684
I think the thing that made me
the most nervous

04:43.717 --> 04:46.487
was losing my voice.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.022
- I'm going to make a drop point
recurve blade.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.359
I am an artist, and the
advantage I think

04:51.392 --> 04:53.927
I might have
is my artistic ability

04:53.961 --> 04:55.896
and being able
to see clean lines

04:55.929 --> 04:58.432
and make
a really beautiful blade.

04:58.466 --> 05:01.702
Growing up, I was told that,
"You shouldn't be an artist,"

05:01.735 --> 05:06.974
and I would make myself prove
to them that they're wrong.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.510
- Your ten-minute design window
is closed.

05:09.543 --> 05:13.013
Your three-hour forge time
starts now.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.683
*

05:15.716 --> 05:18.419
- Aside from the cable,
is there anybody here

05:18.452 --> 05:20.754
that needs to forge-weld
their material?

05:20.788 --> 05:23.857
- Needs to? No.

05:23.891 --> 05:25.859
Should...
- Yeah.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.828
Forge-welding will ensure you'll
have enough material

05:27.861 --> 05:29.597
to meet parameters and be able
to stand up

05:29.630 --> 05:31.832
to the strength test.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.067
*

05:34.101 --> 05:36.904
That's very nice to see Steve
welding the ends of his cable,

05:36.937 --> 05:38.839
'cause we've seen what happens
when you don't.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.475
It will just unspool and come
apart in pieces.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.843
- Working with cable can be
difficult,

05:42.876 --> 05:44.545
but he was smart to pick it,

05:44.578 --> 05:45.879
'cause if he forge-welds it
correctly,

05:45.913 --> 05:48.048
he'll have a very tough
material.

05:48.081 --> 05:51.419
- A piece of cable this large
takes more effort and more time

05:51.452 --> 05:53.454
to get forge-welded up
successfully.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.589
Cable is dirty, nasty stuff.

05:55.623 --> 05:58.659
To get a good weld,
it needs to be clean.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.761
I can add a little flux,

06:00.794 --> 06:02.396
I can wire-brush it
and then start tightening it

06:02.430 --> 06:04.432
and just start working on
that weld.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.434
If I don't get it welded up,

06:06.467 --> 06:07.701
I don't have a knife at the end.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.737
It's that simple.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.005
*

06:12.039 --> 06:14.107
- The first thing I do is
try to cut off the excess

06:14.141 --> 06:15.709
part of the wrench that I didn't
want to incorporate

06:15.743 --> 06:17.845
into the handle.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.613
- I think Tyler's trying to take
off the entire jaw section...

06:19.647 --> 06:21.181
- Yeah, I think so.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.117
- Leaving the adjustable lug
in place.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.086
- We got a chop saw.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.821
Some people like to work harder
than they need to.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.990
- [laughs]

06:30.023 --> 06:31.992
*

06:32.025 --> 06:33.661
- The hardest thing about this
challenge is

06:33.694 --> 06:35.763
being unfamiliar
with the steel.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.131
- I like--Ryan is testing pieces
of his steel.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.833
- Yes.
- He's checked it with a file

06:39.867 --> 06:42.035
a couple times to see how it
hardens up.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.871
- [bleep].

06:43.904 --> 06:46.840
When I file-test,
it bites a little bit.

06:46.874 --> 06:49.810
It means that it may not hold
a really good edge.

06:49.843 --> 06:53.447
So I'm gonna have to put some
love and care into this blade.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.549
And if I have to do multiple
quenches, then so be it.

06:55.583 --> 06:58.586
*

07:01.154 --> 07:02.690
...is probably
my best attribute.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.627
And I'm not worried
about the clock at all.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.195
Looks good. Looks good.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.930
- Well, Mark's got the free time
to wander around

07:09.963 --> 07:11.031
and check out what everybody
else is doing.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.500
- [laughs]
I know.

07:16.570 --> 07:19.172
...but I have to win.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.975
- You have just two hours
remaining

07:22.009 --> 07:23.577
to finish your work!

07:23.611 --> 07:25.679
- Thanks, Wil.

07:25.713 --> 07:28.616
[laughter]

07:28.649 --> 07:31.051
- I look over at Big Blue, and
he's just crying my name.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.152
He's like, "Come over
and use me, please.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.121
Just step on my pedal."

07:34.154 --> 07:37.991
- That steel tapers very quickly
to a very acute point.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.528
Will he have enough steel to
make a 10- to 12-inch blade

07:40.561 --> 07:42.229
out of just one of those
wrenches?

07:42.262 --> 07:44.097
- He can, but it's gonna be
pretty lean.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.733
Forge-welding two of those
wrenches together

07:45.766 --> 07:47.801
would be a safer bet.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.136
- I got the handle pretty much
drawn out

07:49.169 --> 07:50.938
to where I can grind on it.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.706
And now I need to work on
tapering out the blade

07:52.740 --> 07:54.742
and moving all the mass that's
down towards

07:54.775 --> 07:56.544
the handle forward.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.646
to my tanto shape
that I have going on.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.648
*

08:00.681 --> 08:02.550
- This is the lady I'm taking
to the dance.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.952
She looks good.

08:04.985 --> 08:08.055
- So Steve's got his billet over
on Big Blue.

08:08.088 --> 08:11.024
And it looks like it's holding
together from here.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.861
- I'm confident that I have
completed the most important

08:13.894 --> 08:16.597
part of this task--
the forge weld.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.932
Now I have a working piece
that I can continue

08:18.966 --> 08:20.701
with my drawing process.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.971
*

08:24.004 --> 08:27.174
- I clean up my blade and make
it look all pretty.

08:27.207 --> 08:31.779
And I've incorporated the knob
part of the jackhammer bit

08:31.812 --> 08:34.782
inside
of the blade-tang junction.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.550
- He quenched it in water.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.652
I don't know
what's happening.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.253
- He didn't dip it in the water.
He was just screwing with us.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.989
- He's teasing us.
He's teasing us.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.557
- He just wanted to see
my head pop.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.826
- Yep.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.128
- It is very nice to know the
judges were paying attention.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.663
*

08:52.600 --> 08:54.902
So I do a Japanese tip cut.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.304
- Mark--he's got a very, very
lean blade,

08:57.337 --> 08:59.707
and with those wraps around it
at the end,

08:59.740 --> 09:01.709
it's very easy to draw
a tip out of that.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.678
Instead, he cut a pre-form,
so he's lost even more material.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.213
So when he gets to the grinder,

09:06.246 --> 09:08.148
he likely won't have
much material left.

09:08.181 --> 09:11.251
- I would venture to say that
Mark's forging on that

09:11.284 --> 09:15.088
was the absolute minimum he
could possibly do.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.991
- Yeah, and without reforging
that metal entirely,

09:18.025 --> 09:20.360
he won't know exactly how strong
it is.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.663
- How have just 60 minutes
remaining

09:22.696 --> 09:25.165
to finish your work!

09:25.198 --> 09:27.735
- I'm way ahead of where
I thought I was gonna be.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.938
So I'm gonna quench my blade.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.005
- There we go.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.341
Tyler just quenched.

09:34.374 --> 09:37.144
- I come out of the oil,
take the file to it...

09:37.177 --> 09:38.812
[bleep].

09:38.846 --> 09:40.948
It's soft.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.083
I need to go a little higher
with the temperature.

09:43.116 --> 09:46.253
- Tyler not satisfied
with his blade's hardness,

09:46.286 --> 09:48.656
and he's gone right back into
the forge.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.624
- No big deal, right?

09:50.658 --> 09:52.225
People quench two, three
times all the time.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.928
*

09:54.962 --> 09:58.265
- Tyler pulls out of the oil
so quickly, you know...

09:58.298 --> 10:00.067
Let the blade cool a little bit.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.201
- [bleep].

10:01.234 --> 10:04.171
It's still soft.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.339
- Tyler back into the forge.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.941
He'll be going for quench
number three.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.644
- He's putting
more and more stress

10:10.678 --> 10:13.013
every single quench
on that edge.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.816
- If I don't get this blade
hard, I'll get sent home.

10:15.849 --> 10:21.121
*

10:21.154 --> 10:22.690
- Something's going wrong
with Tyler over here.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.292
He's not liking the hardness
of his blade.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.194
This is the third quench
for Tyler.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.730
- I'm having a moment
of self-doubt.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.264
It's not getting has hard as I
thought it would.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.101
I don't know if it's just biting
off the oil or--

10:34.134 --> 10:35.969
The whole thing
seems soft to me.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.438
- It doesn't sound as hard as
it should be.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.708
- [bleep].

10:40.741 --> 10:42.375
I'm gonna keep quenching
until I get a hardened blade.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.344
- He's putting
more and more stress

10:44.377 --> 10:46.013
every single quench
on that edge.

10:46.046 --> 10:50.383
*

10:50.417 --> 10:52.452
- Steve just quenched.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.788
- My question to you is, what
does Steve have to do

10:54.822 --> 10:57.791
to make sure that we see cable
on his blade?

10:57.825 --> 10:59.960
- He could take a piece
of that cable,

10:59.993 --> 11:02.730
wrap it around a ricasso or
something like that.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.465
- To ensure the fact that it is
a knife made from cable,

11:05.498 --> 11:07.901
I add cable bolsters.

11:07.935 --> 11:11.839
And now there is no doubt that
this knife is cable.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.142
[rock music]

11:15.175 --> 11:17.277
- Look at Ryan showing a lot of
patience.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.411
- Well, he's doing
thermocycling,

11:18.445 --> 11:20.280
so that's good.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.784
*

11:23.817 --> 11:25.786
- We've got Ryan there
in the quench.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.120
*

11:27.154 --> 11:28.455
- I file test it...

11:28.488 --> 11:30.724
[bleep].

11:30.758 --> 11:35.262
And realize only the top third
of my blade is hardened.

11:35.295 --> 11:38.899
I'm gonna have to take a chance
and quench again

11:38.932 --> 11:42.502
and pray that this thing
hardens up pretty good.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.138
*

11:45.172 --> 11:47.775
- Quench is the most important
aspect of making a blade,

11:47.808 --> 11:50.177
because before that, it's
nothing but a piece of metal.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.314
First time, quench is good.

11:54.347 --> 11:57.284
*

11:57.317 --> 12:01.288
- Ten, nine, eight, seven,

12:01.321 --> 12:04.057
six, five, four,

12:04.091 --> 12:07.394
three, two, one!

12:07.427 --> 12:09.162
Bladesmiths, shut down your
machines.

12:09.196 --> 12:13.066
Return to your anvils.
Your work is done.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.003
- The bolsters at the end were
kind of a "let's wing it" deal.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.971
We'll see what the judges say.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.207
I'm hoping that I hit
the challenge requirements,

12:20.240 --> 12:22.843
and they move right on over me
to the next guy.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.477
[laughs]

12:24.511 --> 12:26.780
- I'm looking at all these
beautiful blades,

12:26.814 --> 12:29.116
and I'm like, "Gosh, I'm the guy
that made the toothpick."

12:29.149 --> 12:32.285
[dramatic music]

12:32.319 --> 12:34.521
- Bladesmiths, you've had
the last three hours

12:34.554 --> 12:37.490
to forge signature blades
in your signature style

12:37.524 --> 12:40.861
using salvaged materials
of your own choosing.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.996
Now it's time for the judges
to see if you selected

12:43.030 --> 12:45.098
your materials wisely.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.900
Steve, you're up first.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.036
*

12:49.069 --> 12:51.138
- You went with cable,

12:51.171 --> 12:53.540
which is a big risk over to get
them all welded together.

12:53.573 --> 12:56.143
- You did a good job
forge-welding that cable up.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.344
I like your overall design.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.479
One thing, though, is your tang

12:59.512 --> 13:01.481
is out of alignment
with your blade.

13:01.514 --> 13:03.350
But that's still something
you could go back and correct.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.086
Overall, I think you did
a very nice job.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.320
- Mark, you're up.

13:07.354 --> 13:10.323
*

13:10.357 --> 13:11.959
- Mark, I got the feeling here
that you kind of went

13:11.992 --> 13:13.927
the safe route on this one.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.929
You didn't seem to spend a lot
of time at the forge,

13:15.963 --> 13:17.464
more time at the grinder.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.499
This is very lean.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.001
- I like the fact
that, you know,

13:21.034 --> 13:22.903
your edge is nice and
straight.

13:22.936 --> 13:25.238
There's a little bit of a warp
on the back here.

13:25.272 --> 13:28.375
But all in all, I think it's
gonna be a heck of a cutter.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.910
- Ryan, you're up.

13:29.943 --> 13:32.145
*

13:32.179 --> 13:34.047
- I like the shape
of your blade.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.383
I like what you did over here
by making that

13:36.416 --> 13:38.485
the integral part of yr blade
to represent what you chose.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.021
*

13:41.054 --> 13:42.389
- Ryan, you got a lot
of material here.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.524
- Yes, sir.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.960
- I like the aspect in that,
but you have such a thick spine,

13:46.994 --> 13:50.397
I was hoping that you would draw
more material down.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.465
But overall, nicely done.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.202
- Tyler, please present your
work to the judges.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.504
*

13:57.537 --> 13:59.106
- Well, Tyler, first up,

13:59.139 --> 14:02.009
you went for eight quenches,
I believe.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.176
The record is nine.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.112
Just missed it.

14:05.145 --> 14:09.049
There is a warp that is very
visible with your blade.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.318
But overall, I like the shape,
and I love the way you worked

14:11.351 --> 14:14.354
on your handle to represent the
material you worked with.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.890
- These lines
do worry me some.

14:16.924 --> 14:19.092
I'm not sure if these are
stress fractures

14:19.126 --> 14:21.094
or marks from your file test.

14:21.128 --> 14:24.097
Some of them are going in the
direction you were filing,

14:24.131 --> 14:26.133
but some of them aren't.

14:26.166 --> 14:29.002
So I kind of worry that there
are some stress problems

14:29.036 --> 14:31.171
with this blade.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.674
- Well, bladesmiths, the judges
need to decide who's going home.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.376
You'll leave your blades here

14:36.409 --> 14:37.310
and please step
off the Forge floor.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.047
*

14:40.080 --> 14:41.114
- That was intense.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.116
- It was. It was.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.251
- All right, judges,
our bladesmiths

14:44.284 --> 14:46.353
have turned in their work.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.555
Is there a blade on this table
that's absolutely moving forward

14:48.588 --> 14:50.190
no questions asked?

14:50.223 --> 14:51.224
both: Yes.
- Which blade is that?

14:51.258 --> 14:52.993
- Steve.
- Steve.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.661
Okay, we're gonna start with
Ryan's blade.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.263
*

14:56.296 --> 14:58.031
- I like Ryan's blade.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.400
Lining up the tang
and the blade evenly

15:00.433 --> 15:03.336
through this bolster guard
section is very tricky.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.505
And he did
a really nice job on it.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.507
- Oh, gosh.
Here we go.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.609
- Skates nice.

15:09.642 --> 15:13.346
- Okay, let's move on to Tyler's
blade there on the end, please.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.715
*

15:15.748 --> 15:18.385
- We have all that crazing,
that pimpling from the forge.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.420
That's kind of neat when you do
it intentionally.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.956
When it's not intentional,
you're burning your metal.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.025
- And when you talk about
"intentional," I mean,

15:25.058 --> 15:27.394
this was originally supposed to
be a straight blade.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.396
And because of overheating,

15:29.429 --> 15:31.698
he ended up pulling a curve
into it accidentally.

15:31.731 --> 15:35.535
*

15:35.568 --> 15:37.604
Oh, that's definitely
leaving marks.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.172
*

15:39.206 --> 15:40.974
Yeah, it's not skating.

15:41.008 --> 15:42.742
So I think this blade
got burned up.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.577
I think that's why we're
seeing all this crazing

15:44.611 --> 15:48.448
and stuff, and it's just
catching all the way down.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.583
- Let's move on
to Mark's blade.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.718
*

15:51.751 --> 15:54.187
- Very slight warp.

15:54.221 --> 15:57.224
But the bottom line is,
he played it very safe,

15:57.257 --> 16:01.194
and, in doing so, was able
to meet all the parameters.

16:01.228 --> 16:03.430
But is safe good enough?

16:03.463 --> 16:06.766
Did Mark really forge
this blade?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.368
- This drives me crazy.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.038
The tip--
it's not profiled cleanly,

16:11.071 --> 16:12.605
but he had plenty of time
to fix that.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.707
If you're not gonna forge
the tip in correctly,

16:14.741 --> 16:17.744
at least profile it
on the grinder.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.480
And as far as I'm concerned,
that's unfinished.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.016
- Here comes your file test.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.351
*

16:24.384 --> 16:27.220
- It's hard, and it skates.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.422
*

16:29.456 --> 16:32.525
- Gentlemen, it's time for one
of you to leave the Forge.

16:32.559 --> 16:36.629
*

16:36.663 --> 16:39.732
Tyler, your blade did not make
the cut.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.235
- Tyler, the heart and soul of
the blade is the heat treat.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.537
When we file-checked your blade,
the blade bit in,

16:44.571 --> 16:46.373
so the edge is not properly
hardened,

16:46.406 --> 16:47.640
so that's why we're gonna have
to let you go.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.409
- Okay.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.743
- Tyler, please surrender
your blade.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.545
*

16:52.579 --> 16:54.314
- I would love
to have kept going.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.316
But I'm very proud of the fact

16:56.349 --> 16:58.251
that I actually finished
something.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.453
This is a very humbling
experience.

17:00.487 --> 17:03.623
I'm gonna go put everything
into trying to get better.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.193
I hope that maybe I'd be welcome
to come back here

17:06.226 --> 17:09.529
and show people
how talented I really am.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.631
- Congratulations, bladesmiths.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.434
You've made it through the first
round of this competition.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.569
In this round, you'll be taking
your tempered blades

17:16.603 --> 17:18.738
and turning them
into fully functional weapons

17:18.771 --> 17:21.074
by placing handles on them.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.143
One additional stipulation is
that you must include

17:23.176 --> 17:25.178
a lanyard hole.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.580
You will have three hours
in this round.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.449
Keep in mind,
once the time runs out,

17:29.482 --> 17:31.351
your blades will be tested

17:31.384 --> 17:34.287
for strength and durability
in an ice-block chop

17:34.321 --> 17:37.557
and for edge retention
in a rope slice.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.791
Good luck, bladesmiths.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.328
Your three hour starts...

17:41.361 --> 17:43.196
now.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.498
Any bladesmith that comes to
this competition

17:45.532 --> 17:48.235
thinking that fit and finish
doesn't matter

17:48.268 --> 17:50.303
has got another thing coming.

17:50.337 --> 17:53.506
- The plan for my handle is to
use a multicolored G-10

17:53.540 --> 17:57.177
with a laminated piece of
carbon fiber.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.879
- He's got to adjust that tang
till it lines up the blade.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.548
- He should definitely do that

18:01.581 --> 18:03.583
before worrying
about that handle.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.286
- It's important to get the
sandwich of the scales clean,

18:06.319 --> 18:09.156
prepped, glued, so I have good,
solid cure time

18:09.189 --> 18:12.525
before I really start grinding
in them and inducing heat.

18:12.559 --> 18:16.363
[rock music]

18:16.396 --> 18:18.198
- Smells wonderful, doesn't it?

18:18.231 --> 18:20.867
The plan for my handle is to do
a stacking method

18:20.900 --> 18:26.139
using brass, buffalo horn,
and linen Micarta.

18:26.173 --> 18:29.476
I am an artist, and I have
the eye for detail.

18:29.509 --> 18:32.345
- Using a little bit of brass,
it's a nice transition piece

18:32.379 --> 18:35.515
as opposed to using
just the synthetic material.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.185
- J., what about Ryan's blade?

18:38.218 --> 18:40.353
Is there some prep work that has
to be done on that?

18:40.387 --> 18:42.355
- I'd like to see him thin
that blade out somewhat,

18:42.389 --> 18:43.723
'cause I'm worried
about the edge geometry

18:43.756 --> 18:44.791
being able to go
through the rope.

18:44.824 --> 18:48.761
*

18:48.795 --> 18:50.897
- Three hours seems like a lot
of time,

18:50.930 --> 18:53.666
but normally at home,
I'll spend a week

18:53.700 --> 18:54.734
making a handle for a blade.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.842
- So I would venture to say
that Mark,

19:02.875 --> 19:05.712
to make up for his lack of
brilliance in the first round,

19:05.745 --> 19:07.547
is going for a multipiece
construction

19:07.580 --> 19:09.516
on a handle in the second.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.318
- You want to see these smiths
bring their A game

19:11.351 --> 19:12.919
to these competitions, but
they're running the risk

19:12.952 --> 19:15.622
of biting off more than they can
chew in three hours.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.458
- One hour down,
only two to go!

19:18.491 --> 19:20.293
*

19:20.327 --> 19:21.661
- Well, Steve's over here

19:21.694 --> 19:23.896
doing the dual-propane-torch
technique

19:23.930 --> 19:26.533
that we rarely have witnessed
in this forge.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.568
- Most smiths can only afford
one torch.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.803
- [laughs]

19:30.837 --> 19:32.572
- The vise is gonna act
as a heat sink

19:32.605 --> 19:34.841
to keep the heat away
from my cutting edge.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.843
I don't want to get crazy hot,
but I need enough heat into it

19:36.876 --> 19:38.845
that I can safely flex it

19:38.878 --> 19:40.847
and be able to get it to stay
where I was bending it.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.251
*

19:44.284 --> 19:45.985
Since that's still warm,

19:46.018 --> 19:48.688
I have to drill three holes
in this tang--

19:48.721 --> 19:50.490
one rather large hole
for the lanyard

19:50.523 --> 19:52.692
and two pin stock holes.

19:52.725 --> 19:56.429
*

19:56.463 --> 19:58.298
- I stack all my materials,

19:58.331 --> 20:00.767
and I'm ready
to glue it all together.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.902
Once I get the handle all packed
and glued and everything,

20:02.935 --> 20:05.272
make sure my fit is okay,

20:05.305 --> 20:07.006
I'm gonna go ahead and let the
glue dry for about five minutes.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.441
*

20:08.475 --> 20:10.543
- Oh, that's gonna be a mess.

20:10.577 --> 20:12.879
- This reminds me of when I used
to eat glue in kindergarten.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.481
[laughs]
- Explains a lot.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.583
*

20:16.616 --> 20:19.619
- All right, we're gonna give
that a second to dry.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.721
So, once I glue it
all together,

20:21.754 --> 20:23.623
I look over at my competitors,

20:23.656 --> 20:27.694
and I feel I am out ahead
a little bit.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.662
Chh-chh-chh-chh-chh-chh.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.698
- We talked about how the edge
geometry on his blade

20:31.731 --> 20:34.901
needs to be corrected in order
to not only withstand the ice

20:34.934 --> 20:36.603
but also to cut through a rope.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.605
I don't understand what's
happening right now.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.707
- He could still be working
on the details of that blade

20:40.740 --> 20:42.742
while the glue dries.

20:42.775 --> 20:45.278
- Yeah, buddy.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.946
Having fun.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.981
- I'm just trying to get
the holes cut through,

20:49.015 --> 20:51.718
So I can get them on the tang,
get them glued up.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.587
- In this competition, we have
not seen Mark move

20:54.621 --> 20:55.922
like a fireball yet.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.023
And he's got
a lot of work to do.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.858
[dramatic music]

21:02.395 --> 21:03.863
I'm on the last hole...

21:03.896 --> 21:06.065
Oh, [bleep].

21:06.098 --> 21:07.967
Snap. It breaks in half.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.370
I feel like a ton of bricks
falls on me.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.439
*

21:12.472 --> 21:18.545
[bleep].

21:18.578 --> 21:20.813
- Oh, [bleep].

21:20.847 --> 21:25.518
- Okay, so Mark has just broken
some of his handle material.

21:25.552 --> 21:27.320
- I feel like a ton ofofricks
falls on me.

21:27.354 --> 21:28.788
I go get another piece.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.823
I start drilling again.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.792
I just got to carry on

21:32.825 --> 21:35.695
and try to finish
before the time's up.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.630
- Two hours has elapsed!

21:37.664 --> 21:40.800
You have just 60 minutes
remaining to finish your work!

21:40.833 --> 21:43.436
- I still have to put
a lanyard hole in,

21:43.470 --> 21:45.672
but I am not worried about that.

21:45.705 --> 21:48.708
So, first, I got to make sure
that I do something

21:48.741 --> 21:50.677
that impresses the judges.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.779
So what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna go ahead and carve

21:52.812 --> 21:54.847
this piece of buffalo horn out,
put it in here

21:54.881 --> 21:57.116
as a little inlay, cap it off.

21:57.149 --> 22:01.754
I want to show the judges
exactly what I like to do

22:01.788 --> 22:05.492
in terms of my artistry and what
I like to put into my blade.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.094
- Doug, are you confused
by this construction?

22:08.127 --> 22:09.862
- I sure am.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.398
Because you're looking
at the material--

22:11.431 --> 22:12.899
he's got
too many layers there.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.901
How is he gonna form that?

22:14.934 --> 22:16.969
[rock music]

22:17.003 --> 22:19.506
- So far, everything's looking
good, lining up nice.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.541
Now we just got to make it
pretty.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.910
*

22:23.943 --> 22:26.413
I'm happy with the outside
profile on the handle.

22:26.446 --> 22:28.715
Now I got to get an edge
on this thing.

22:28.748 --> 22:31.418
I'm gearing it
towards the ice chop.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.453
I've never chopped ice
with a knife,

22:33.486 --> 22:36.856
but I'm looking forward to
seeing things fly.

22:36.889 --> 22:39.992
*

22:40.026 --> 22:41.594
- I finally get my handle glued
together.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.430
*

22:46.599 --> 22:48.568
- I'm starting to worry
a little bit about Mark.

22:48.601 --> 22:52.171
He still doesn't have
a lanyard hole in his handle.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.106
- I have to get that pommel on,

22:54.140 --> 22:56.543
so I just mixed up some glue
and stuck it on.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.545
- Two minutes, bladesmiths!

22:58.578 --> 23:00.980
You only have twtwminutes
remaining to finish your work!

23:01.013 --> 23:04.551
- And then I remember I need
to finish the lanyard hole.

23:07.620 --> 23:08.988
*

23:09.021 --> 23:11.424
- 30 seconds.

23:11.458 --> 23:16.496
*

23:16.529 --> 23:21.501
Five, four, three,
two, one.

23:21.534 --> 23:25.071
Bladesmiths, secure your blades
and return to your anvils.

23:25.104 --> 23:28.040
This round is over.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.543
- My biggest concern going into
testing is that

23:30.577 --> 23:34.013
my edge may possibly roll a
little bit.

23:34.046 --> 23:37.450
But I guess
we'll just have to see.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.118
- Smiths, welcome
to the strength test--

23:39.151 --> 23:41.020
the ice-block chop.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.889
[chuckles]

23:42.922 --> 23:45.057
I'm gonna take each of your
knives and strike these

23:45.091 --> 23:47.627
ice blocks six times.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.195
This is gonna test
the strength of your edge,

23:49.228 --> 23:51.598
as well as the overall
durability of your knife.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.566
Steve, you're up first.
You ready?

23:53.600 --> 23:55.201
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do it.

23:55.234 --> 23:57.704
*

23:57.737 --> 23:59.672
- I'm feeling confident that
the knife will perform well.

23:59.706 --> 24:01.040
I know it's heavy enough.

24:01.073 --> 24:02.074
It's rock solid.

24:02.108 --> 24:09.048
*

24:13.252 --> 24:16.689
*

24:16.723 --> 24:18.525
- Edge is perfect.

24:18.558 --> 24:21.861
Didn't roll over,
didn't chip out.

24:21.894 --> 24:24.531
The handle
is a little bit narrow.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.833
But it held up.
Good job.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.668
- Thank you.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.503
- Ryan, you ready?
- Do I have a choice?

24:30.537 --> 24:31.538
- No, not really.

24:31.571 --> 24:32.572
[laughter]

24:32.605 --> 24:33.573
- All yours.

24:33.606 --> 24:36.008
*

24:36.042 --> 24:39.746
I would compare this blade to
probably a Ferrari.

24:39.779 --> 24:43.950
But I wouldn't want to lend my
Ferrari to J. Neilson,

24:43.983 --> 24:50.890
*

24:52.191 --> 24:53.860
Good God.

24:53.893 --> 24:56.529
[laughter]

24:56.563 --> 24:58.264
- Held up, Ryan.

24:58.297 --> 25:00.533
Still got a really, really
sharp edge on there.

25:00.567 --> 25:03.102
My concern is the handle.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.905
Having this integral
chunk here,

25:05.938 --> 25:08.741
immediately just want to reach
up and grab it up here.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.677
That's not where you want it,
'cause you don't want it

25:10.710 --> 25:11.611
so close to the edge there.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.079
- Yeah.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.047
- Mark, what you thinking?

25:15.081 --> 25:16.816
- I'm ready to rock.

25:16.849 --> 25:23.756
*

25:31.898 --> 25:35.301
*

25:35.334 --> 25:36.903
- Mark, she held up.

25:36.936 --> 25:39.706
You got a little bit
of edge deformation.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.340
It's nothing major.

25:41.373 --> 25:43.142
But there's definitely some
issues on the handle.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.044
I mean, you've got
a guard on here,

25:45.077 --> 25:46.713
but it's not all the way up.

25:46.746 --> 25:48.715
That's why it's nice to have
a ricasso here

25:48.748 --> 25:50.082
so it makes it easier
to fit the guard up

25:50.116 --> 25:53.052
without all
of this gap in here.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.721
Next up is the sharpness test.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.022
For that, I'm gonna turn you
over to Doug.

25:56.055 --> 25:58.891
*

25:58.925 --> 26:01.861
- That was fun to watch your
blades go up against the ice.

26:01.894 --> 26:05.164
But are they still sharp?

26:05.197 --> 26:07.800
I will take your weapon,
and I'll deliver three slices

26:07.834 --> 26:09.869
on this rope.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.638
Steve, you're up first.
You ready?

26:11.671 --> 26:12.639
- Let's do this.

26:12.672 --> 26:19.578
*

26:26.318 --> 26:28.621
- All right, Steve,
it wouldn't cut

26:28.655 --> 26:30.356
all the way
through the rope,

26:30.389 --> 26:33.860
but it is sharp enough to
lacerate some of the strands,

26:33.893 --> 26:37.196
so overall, your knife will cut.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.831
- Thank you.

26:38.865 --> 26:40.066
- Ryan, you're next.
You ready?

26:40.099 --> 26:41.200
- All yours, buddy.

26:41.233 --> 26:48.174
*

26:52.745 --> 26:54.246
Wow.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.082
- I don't see any deformations
in the blade.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.950
It stayed true.

26:57.984 --> 27:01.287
It did slice some pieces
of rope, so it is sharp,

27:01.320 --> 27:02.989
and your blade will cut.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.891
- Thank you, sir.

27:04.924 --> 27:05.892
- Mark, you're up.
You ready?

27:05.925 --> 27:08.027
- Let's do it.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.863
Ryan's rope slices were about
the same as Steve's.

27:10.897 --> 27:12.932
That didn't help
my confidence at all,

27:12.965 --> 27:14.701
'cause I thought both their
edges were better than mine.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.736
*

27:16.769 --> 27:18.738
I'm thinking my blade's gonna
bounce off the rope.

27:18.771 --> 27:21.240
I'm nervous as hell, and I'm
really thinking I'm screwed.

27:21.273 --> 27:29.648
*

27:34.887 --> 27:37.056
- Nice.

27:37.089 --> 27:41.327
- Your edge geometry definitely
works better on a rope cut.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.362
It sliced in deeper.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.798
Overall, your blade will cut.

27:45.832 --> 27:47.900
- Thank you.
- But on your handle

27:47.934 --> 27:51.470
construction, there's a lot of
gaps I can see.

27:51.503 --> 27:54.306
You can see the glue all over,
so it's not as finished

27:54.340 --> 27:56.042
as the other blades.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.877
And it's only held together
by glue.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.380
- I'm thinking I'm running even

28:01.413 --> 28:03.282
simply because my test
performances

28:03.315 --> 28:04.951
were better than the other
contestants.

28:04.984 --> 28:07.086
*

28:07.119 --> 28:10.289
- Bladesmiths, it's time for one
of you to leave the Forge.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.091
*

28:12.124 --> 28:14.894
Mark, you blade
did not make the cut.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.495
J. Neilson will explain.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.197
- Mark, aside from being the
only blade

28:18.230 --> 28:19.766
that suffered damage
during our testing,

28:19.799 --> 28:21.400
we also felt that your blade

28:21.433 --> 28:23.335
was the least finished
of the three.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.171
So, for those reasons, we have
to let you go.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.806
- Mark, please surrender
your blade.

28:26.839 --> 28:28.474
*

28:28.507 --> 28:31.811
- My blade was not as finished
as it should be.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.212
Yeah, I tried
right to the last second,

28:33.245 --> 28:35.047
but I ran out of time.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.183
I may not be
a "Forged in Fire" champion,

28:37.216 --> 28:39.786
but I'm definitely the quietest
"Forged in Fire" competitor.

28:39.819 --> 28:43.389

28:43.422 --> 28:45.825
- Steve, Ryan, congratulations.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.894
You have forged your way
to the final round

28:47.927 --> 28:49.528
of this competition.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.063
In the first two rounds, you
came to our forge

28:51.097 --> 28:52.899
and used our tools
and equipment

28:52.932 --> 28:56.435
to forge signature blades
out of salvaged steel.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.437
Now we're sending you
back to your home forges,

28:58.470 --> 29:01.307
where you will re-create
an iconic weapon from history.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.909
That weapon is...

29:02.942 --> 29:05.377
*

29:05.411 --> 29:06.445
The Charay.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.380
*

29:08.414 --> 29:10.382
The history of the Charay sword
is deeply tied

29:10.416 --> 29:12.919
to the violent history
of the Khyber Pass,

29:12.952 --> 29:15.855
which separates Afghanistan
and Pakistan.

29:15.888 --> 29:18.024
The sharp, single-edged blade
was a key asset

29:18.057 --> 29:19.926
of the Afridi tribe.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.560
The Charay
had devastating consequences

29:21.593 --> 29:23.329
for the Afridi's enemies,

29:23.362 --> 29:25.497
because it could pierce
through armor.

29:25.531 --> 29:28.367
The distinctive T shape of
the spine gives extra strength

29:28.400 --> 29:31.337
to the Charay's
razor-sharp blade.

29:31.370 --> 29:34.974
The blade must include
a T-back spine

29:35.007 --> 29:36.976
and a metal bolster.

29:37.009 --> 29:38.878
- It's a very familiar shape
to me.

29:38.911 --> 29:40.880
But I started looking
a little closer,

29:40.913 --> 29:44.016
and it's a complex design
of a small package.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.518
- After five days, you will
return and present your Charays

29:46.552 --> 29:48.587
to our panel of expert judges.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.023
Only after they've put your
weapon through a series

29:51.057 --> 29:53.225
of brutal tests
will they declare one of you

29:53.259 --> 29:54.326
the "Forged in Fire" champion.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.096
Good luck, bladesmiths.

29:57.129 --> 30:00.566
*

30:00.599 --> 30:04.236
- The Charay is going to be
difficult to build.

30:04.270 --> 30:07.106
It had a lot of hand-tooling
that I've never done before,

30:07.139 --> 30:09.008
but I love a challenge.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.410
*

30:11.443 --> 30:14.146
I am taking a risk on making it
Damascus.

30:14.180 --> 30:16.182
It's gonna make
the piece look nicer.

30:16.215 --> 30:19.185
They hold an excellent edge.
It's very tough.

30:19.218 --> 30:22.321
But I could be building problems
into it

30:22.354 --> 30:24.590
by having an inclusion or just
a poor weld.

30:24.623 --> 30:26.625
*

30:26.658 --> 30:29.929
I'm hoping to get three full
draws and flips, you know.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.264
The challenging part
of the process is,

30:32.298 --> 30:34.166
it's very monotonous.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.335
Draw it out,
clean it, fold it,

30:36.368 --> 30:38.905
draw it out, clean it,
fold it.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.307
But all the welds
are very clean.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.275
There's no delamination.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.311
There's no blisters.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.947
I mean, everything looks really
good at this point.

30:47.980 --> 30:50.549
[rock music]

30:50.582 --> 30:52.218
- It feels great being back here

30:52.251 --> 30:54.386
in nice sunny Jacksonville,
Florida.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.957
My day-one goal is to actually
get this blade forged.

30:57.990 --> 31:01.961
*

31:01.994 --> 31:04.496
The only thing I'm really
concerned about

31:04.530 --> 31:08.100
is getting the T-back
of the spine correct.

31:08.134 --> 31:10.502
I'm going to create
this T-spine

31:10.536 --> 31:13.472
by forging in fuller grooves.

31:13.505 --> 31:16.642
Getting that correct
is very crucial.

31:16.675 --> 31:19.411
Not good.

31:19.445 --> 31:22.248
The problem is, I put
a little bit too much pressure,

31:22.281 --> 31:25.484
and it looks like
it squished through.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.987
It's too thin, and I got
a little bit of daylight

31:28.020 --> 31:30.556
showing in there, so...

31:30.589 --> 31:33.359
I'm gonna have to start over.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.627
*

31:35.661 --> 31:38.630
- I was able to finish up
the layering.

31:38.664 --> 31:42.001
I got the overall dimensions
forged out.

31:42.034 --> 31:46.172
But I've never forged a T
into a spine before.

31:46.205 --> 31:50.542
If I as in an Afghan desert,
this is probably how I would...

31:50.576 --> 31:52.511
*

31:52.544 --> 31:54.380
Have to do this.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.984
So I drew everything
over length.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.652
And then just started to upset
that spine

32:00.686 --> 32:03.589
bring it out
in the shape of a T.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.324
I think it's working great.

32:05.357 --> 32:08.260
Made a nice, even T there.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.997
It went way quicker
than I thought it would.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.165
It allowed me to get
to the quench today.

32:13.199 --> 32:15.234
*

32:15.267 --> 32:17.636
It seems like everything
went well.

32:17.669 --> 32:20.272
But as I was trying
to pull it out...

32:20.306 --> 32:21.974
*

32:22.008 --> 32:23.342
[bleep].

32:23.375 --> 32:24.576
Boom.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.512
*

32:26.545 --> 32:29.415
[blade clatters]
[bleep].

32:29.448 --> 32:35.454
[bleep].

32:35.487 --> 32:38.090
- After yesterday, having
trashed my blade,
*

32:38.124 --> 32:41.493
I really need to get this blade
done today.

32:41.527 --> 32:43.262
So far, so good.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.230
Looking pretty awesome.

32:44.263 --> 32:45.364
*

32:45.397 --> 32:47.566
Forging in this T joint

32:47.599 --> 32:50.602
is a lot harder than I thought
it was gonna be.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.139
So today I'm using
my other option,

32:53.172 --> 32:54.640
which is the grinding wheel.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.775
This is very crucial.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.378
I really can't afford to have
to do this blade over again.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.647
*

33:01.680 --> 33:03.449
As I'm grinding in the T,
I notice that it's standing

33:03.482 --> 33:05.217
out way better than I ever
thought.

33:05.251 --> 33:07.186
I can control it a lot better.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.355
Everything's getting a lot
lighter.

33:09.388 --> 33:12.224
And I am very happy
at this point.

33:12.258 --> 33:14.293
*

33:14.326 --> 33:16.628
- When I was quenching,
obviously the blade fell.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.597
But I got lucky.

33:18.630 --> 33:21.033
Everything's fine.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.669
So I'd like to get through some
testing early this morning.

33:23.702 --> 33:27.306
Failure during testing here
would give me

33:27.339 --> 33:31.377
only 14, 15 hours to build
a complete Charay.

33:31.410 --> 33:34.146
So I don't need a failure here.

33:34.180 --> 33:39.518
*

33:39.551 --> 33:44.323
Oh, yeah.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.092
Ate that up
absolutely no problem.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.826
[chuckles]

33:47.859 --> 33:49.295
*

33:49.328 --> 33:51.697
This blade looks extremely sexy.

33:51.730 --> 33:55.101
I'm just gonna concentrate
on doing my handle skills,

33:55.134 --> 33:58.270
inlays, cleaning up the blade
a lot more.

33:58.304 --> 34:01.507
I decide that I want to
carve a wolf head

34:01.540 --> 34:04.243
in the front of it just to kind
of set it apart,

34:04.276 --> 34:06.512
make it stand out.

34:06.545 --> 34:07.813
My wolf looks badass.

34:07.846 --> 34:09.581
*

34:09.615 --> 34:10.649
The blade's sharp.
The blade's strong.

34:10.682 --> 34:12.484
It's time to test it.

34:12.518 --> 34:13.419
All right, here we go.

34:13.452 --> 34:20.392
*

34:23.262 --> 34:25.131
That's pretty good.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.865
There's no edge damage
or anything.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.534
Just bring it on, man.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.669
Do whatever you want to do.
[laughs]

34:30.702 --> 34:31.637
Awesome.

34:31.670 --> 34:37.576
*

34:37.609 --> 34:41.447
- Steve, Ryan, welcome back,
and welcome to the gun range.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.649
As you can imagine, if we're
here, we're planning on doing

34:43.682 --> 34:45.684
some pretty brutal things to
your blades.

34:45.717 --> 34:48.787
But before that, Steven, how did
it go at your home forge?

34:48.820 --> 34:51.190
- You know, it was--it was a
challenge.

34:51.223 --> 34:53.459
That T-back--
thank you for that.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.327
You can't grind your bevels

34:55.361 --> 34:57.329
with that T
hanging out over the side,

34:57.363 --> 34:59.598
so I kind of had to relearn
how to make a knife.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.500
- All right, Ryan, how'd it go
for you at your home forge?

35:01.533 --> 35:03.602
- Oh, it was crazy.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.837
I used good old 5160 and did
a little bit of Damascus

35:05.871 --> 35:07.673
for the handle.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.476
- Well, gentlemen, up first,
the kill test.

35:10.509 --> 35:11.510
Doug.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.779
*

35:13.812 --> 35:17.916
- Bladesmiths, the Charay was a
weapon know to be light, fast,

35:17.949 --> 35:20.252
and sharp.

35:20.286 --> 35:22.421
To see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon can do,

35:22.454 --> 35:24.423
I will take your Charay and
deliver slashes and stabs

35:24.456 --> 35:26.358
on this ballistics dummy.

35:26.392 --> 35:27.659
Steve, you're up first.
You ready?

35:27.693 --> 35:28.660
- Absolutely.

35:28.694 --> 35:29.795
- Let's do this.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.763
*

35:31.797 --> 35:34.533
- That ballistic dummy,
they're incredibly tough.

35:34.566 --> 35:38.370
But I'm hoping that it performs
as well as I think it should.

35:38.404 --> 35:45.344
*

35:47.579 --> 35:49.481
*

35:49.515 --> 35:51.283
Wow.
[laughs]

35:51.317 --> 35:54.653
*

35:54.686 --> 35:57.956
- Well, Steve, I like the
Damascus pattern,

35:57.989 --> 36:00.492
and overall, it's got a great
fit and finish.

36:00.526 --> 36:03.829
Your edge definitely lacerated.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.831
It even cut into the rib.

36:05.864 --> 36:09.268
On the slash, it lacerates
and has a deep thrust

36:09.301 --> 36:12.704
and allows me to disembowel
this ballistics dummy.

36:12.738 --> 36:15.507
Your blade, sir, will kill.
- Thank you.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.543
- Ryan, you're next. You ready?
- Yeah, man.

36:17.576 --> 36:24.483
*

36:35.261 --> 36:38.964
*

36:38.997 --> 36:41.867
Well, Ryan, let's talk about
your blade.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.436
For a Charay, it is heavy.

36:44.470 --> 36:48.474
But it's sharp enough to
lacerate and dig in,

36:48.507 --> 36:50.976
and the thrust allows for a
laceration out.

36:51.009 --> 36:53.479
Your blade, sir, will kill.

36:53.512 --> 36:54.713
*

36:54.746 --> 36:56.315
Up next is the sharpness test.

36:56.348 --> 36:57.949
For that, Dave.

36:57.983 --> 37:00.519
*

37:00.552 --> 37:02.654
- All right, gentlemen, now, to
test the sharpness of your blade

37:02.688 --> 37:04.823
I'll be cutting through these
racks of sugarcane

37:04.856 --> 37:06.658
forehand and backhand.

37:06.692 --> 37:08.427
What I want to see
is a clean cut

37:08.460 --> 37:11.597
with very little resistance
to that blade.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.499
Steve, you're up first.
You ready?

37:13.532 --> 37:14.633
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

37:14.666 --> 37:21.607
*

37:26.812 --> 37:29.715
*

37:29.748 --> 37:32.484
All right, well, it felt good
cutting with this.

37:32.518 --> 37:34.453
You can see these first cuts
were very clean.

37:34.486 --> 37:38.023
This second cut, I kind of blew
through this one.

37:38.056 --> 37:40.959
You can actually see where the
T-back smacked that sucker.

37:40.992 --> 37:43.495
Now, that's typical
of a shaped blade.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.564
Well done.
- Thank you.

37:45.597 --> 37:46.865
- All right, Ryan, you're up.
You ready for this?

37:46.898 --> 37:48.066
- Do me proud.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.035
This thing is sharp.

37:50.068 --> 37:52.938
So I'm expecting clean slices

37:52.971 --> 37:54.640
all the way
through the sugarcanes.

37:54.673 --> 38:01.613
*

38:04.450 --> 38:07.519
- So, Ryan, first off, there's a
lot of weight in this blade.

38:07.553 --> 38:10.589
That T-back is there to take
weight out.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.424
But everything's
still right and tight.

38:12.458 --> 38:15.327
It obviously cut pretty well.

38:15.361 --> 38:16.962
Cut two of these canes.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.530
Kind of just mashed that one
out of the way.

38:18.564 --> 38:20.866
But you can see the cut in there
is clean.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.034
I like the decorative pieces--

38:23.068 --> 38:25.604
you know,
this wolf's head here.

38:25.637 --> 38:27.406
All in all, she's a cutter.

38:27.439 --> 38:28.674
It's definitely sharp.

38:28.707 --> 38:30.676
*

38:30.709 --> 38:32.578
All right, gentlemen, next up,
the strength test.

38:32.611 --> 38:34.413
It's the bullet test.

38:34.446 --> 38:36.482
So let's clear that range
and get this set.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.484
- We're at the gun range.

38:38.517 --> 38:40.652
Of course, they're gonna shoot
bullets at our swords.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.621
I can't wait to see
what happens.

38:42.654 --> 38:45.557
- Now, we've got your blade,
Steve, locked into a vise.

38:45.591 --> 38:48.126
We're gonna fire one round
right at that edge.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.363
If everything's good,
should split that bullet fine.

38:51.397 --> 38:52.531
You ready for this?

38:52.564 --> 38:53.765
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

38:53.799 --> 38:56.968
- .45-caliber, 230-grain slug,

38:57.002 --> 38:59.004
traveling
at 800 feet per second,

38:59.037 --> 39:02.107
impacting with 430 foot-pounds
of force

39:02.140 --> 39:04.376
on a tiny, tiny little area.

39:04.410 --> 39:05.577
I'm pretty nervous.

39:05.611 --> 39:07.779
- Three, two,

39:07.813 --> 39:09.448
one, fire.

39:09.481 --> 39:21.760
*

39:21.793 --> 39:24.696
- Oh, look at that.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.532
So Dave removes it
from the vise,

39:26.565 --> 39:27.833
does a quick examination.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.601
He takes a good look at it,

39:29.635 --> 39:31.737
and I'm starting to get
a little nervous.

39:31.770 --> 39:33.639
You know, is he seeing
something?

39:33.672 --> 39:37.443
*

39:37.476 --> 39:39.010
- Well...

39:39.044 --> 39:40.812
you still got
an edge there.

39:40.846 --> 39:43.549
You can actually see
right where the bullet

39:43.582 --> 39:46.485
spun down the side
of that blade.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.754
You see where it caught the T
back on that side?

39:48.787 --> 39:52.424
But I think you made
a beautiful piece here,

39:52.458 --> 39:53.892
and it certainly held up
in that test.

39:53.925 --> 39:55.994
- Thank you, sir.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.829
- All right, Ryan, you're up.
Are you ready for this?

39:57.863 --> 39:58.764
- Let's do it.

39:58.797 --> 40:02.133
*

40:02.167 --> 40:06.037
- Three, two, one, fire.

40:06.071 --> 40:12.644
*

40:12.678 --> 40:14.480
- Damn.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.882
[laughs]
Holy [bleep].

40:16.915 --> 40:19.718
- All right, Ryan, I don't see
any damage at all.

40:19.751 --> 40:22.153
That bullet painted your blade
pretty good.

40:22.187 --> 40:25.457
Didn't touch
the T-back on this side.

40:25.491 --> 40:27.058
Kind of caught a little bit
on that side.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.694
But all in all,

40:28.727 --> 40:31.096
there's zero
edge damage there.

40:31.129 --> 40:33.131
Nicely done.
- Thank you, sir.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.467
- Testing's over.
I'm feeling pretty good.

40:35.501 --> 40:37.102
But at the same time,
Steve did well,

40:37.135 --> 40:39.505
so we're pretty much
neck and neck.

40:39.538 --> 40:40.972
It's up to the judges
at this point

40:41.006 --> 40:43.909
to make the final decision.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.044
*

40:46.077 --> 40:49.147
- Bladesmiths, these decisions
are always tough,

40:49.180 --> 40:51.116
but the judges have made one.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.885
There can only be one
"Forged in Fire" champion

40:53.919 --> 40:56.254
in this arena of competition,
and that champion is...

40:56.287 --> 41:00.025
*

41:00.058 --> 41:01.126
Steve.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.794
Congratulations.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.095
You are the "Forged in Fire"
champion.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.164
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

41:06.197 --> 41:08.166
- Ryan, unfortunately, your
blade did not make the cut.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.636
J. Neilson will explain.

41:10.669 --> 41:13.204
- During the testing, both of
your knives performed equally.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.974
And they did fantastic,
so it came down

41:16.007 --> 41:18.844
to the smaller details--
the fit, finish, symmetry.

41:18.877 --> 41:22.548
Ryan, your blade, there's waves
on the surface,

41:22.581 --> 41:24.850
on the T-back, on the spine.

41:24.883 --> 41:27.152
The big thing, though,
it's an extremely heavy weapon,

41:27.185 --> 41:30.522
way more so than Steve's,
and for those reasons,

41:30.556 --> 41:31.557
that's why
we got to let you go.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.659
- Understandable.

41:33.692 --> 41:36.862
- Ryan, I have to ask you,
please surrender your weapon.

41:36.895 --> 41:39.164
*

41:39.197 --> 41:41.099
"Forged in Fire" champion would
have meant the world to me.

41:41.132 --> 41:43.535
But you just really have to be
on you're A game, you know.

41:43.569 --> 41:45.203
No matter what it takes,

41:45.236 --> 41:47.138
you just got
to pull out all the stops.

41:47.172 --> 41:48.907
You got to make sure you look
at the finer details,

41:48.940 --> 41:50.942
and, you know, that's what it
takes to win this.

41:50.976 --> 41:52.210
*

41:52.243 --> 41:53.845
- Steve, congratulations.

41:53.879 --> 41:55.614
You are the "Forged in Fire"
champion.

41:55.647 --> 41:58.817
And that's a title that comes
with $10,000.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.653
Good job.
- Thank you.

42:01.687 --> 42:03.622
Thank you.

42:03.655 --> 42:05.056
- Steve, your blade was light,
well-constructed,

42:05.090 --> 42:07.158
and it did wonderfully
in the tests,

42:07.192 --> 42:08.927
and also the fact this is the
first time you've done a T-back,

42:08.960 --> 42:10.228
that makes it that much more
impressive.

42:10.261 --> 42:12.097
Well done.

42:12.130 --> 42:13.965
- I am a "Forged in Fire"
champion.

42:13.999 --> 42:16.568
Yay.

42:16.602 --> 42:18.837
I came here to prove
that I can compete

42:18.870 --> 42:22.708
with some of the best smiths
in the world and beat them.

42:22.741 --> 42:24.109
And I did just that.

42:24.142 --> 42:25.911
[laughs]

42:25.944 --> 42:30.281
*
