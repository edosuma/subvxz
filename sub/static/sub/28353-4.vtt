00:13.096 --> 00:15.110
Bro, if we're gonna be living together,

00:15.120 --> 00:16.590
pretty sure we can
sleep in the same bed.

00:16.683 --> 00:17.934
My bed is your bed.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.230
Yeah, sure.

00:22.939 --> 00:25.108
Thanks.

00:27.485 --> 00:30.613
Maybe I can finally get
a good night's sleep.

00:38.930 --> 00:42.000
_

00:47.390 --> 00:49.540
_

00:54.637 --> 00:55.637
You're dreaming.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.724
This is a really odd dream.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.780
_

01:07.580 --> 01:08.609
Argh!

01:08.610 --> 01:10.040
_

01:17.250 --> 01:19.420
_

01:20.180 --> 01:22.020
Damn, girl. You look good.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.376
What you mean? Why you askin'
about him all the time?

01:29.964 --> 01:31.966
Of course you're gonna meet Cesar, baby.

01:32.217 --> 01:33.760
It's only a matter of time.

01:35.386 --> 01:36.554
You know I got you.

01:36.888 --> 01:38.640
- _
- I always got you, girl.

01:46.120 --> 01:47.770
_

01:47.774 --> 01:50.610
Sounds like you're really
connecting with Julia, or...

01:51.236 --> 01:52.862
do you call her Selena?

01:53.196 --> 01:54.948
She goes by Julia now.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.699
She's just beyond.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.660
I mean we've so much in common.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.304
Everything. From the same taste in music

02:00.305 --> 02:01.496
to the same taste in ice cream.

02:01.579 --> 02:03.039
It's seriously uncanny.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.582
Almost like you're related.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.751
There's only one problem.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.586
I feel like I'm cheating on my dad.

02:09.211 --> 02:11.381
I thought you were gonna
tell him last week.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.882
Yeah, me too. But...

02:13.466 --> 02:15.093
it never feels like the right time.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.929
Hey, don't be scared. You have
a right to know your mom.

02:18.221 --> 02:21.057
I'm not scared. I'm completely aware
of my rights as a kid in this

02:21.182 --> 02:24.310
vajacked situation and I'm not
gonna let anyone make me feel...

02:24.686 --> 02:27.147
Okay, I'm scared. But
you're one to talk.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.440
When are you gonna sit Jamal
down and tell him to back off?

02:29.524 --> 02:30.600
Never.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.902
Jamal hears, but he doesn't listen.

02:33.528 --> 02:37.031
It's like he has no idea what
boundaries look or feel like.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.909
- We're totally...
- Yin and yang.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.619
Really? You and Cesar?

02:41.703 --> 02:44.706
Yeah! No one would have
guessed. But we are like...

02:45.165 --> 02:49.210
Siamese fraternal twins giving each
other hugs in the womb. It's...

02:49.294 --> 02:50.295
Suffocating!

02:50.753 --> 02:53.131
Jamal was born without
a personal bubble.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.216
You need to look on the bright side.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.926
What bright side?

02:57.010 --> 02:59.804
I finally have a brother.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.389
Someone who gets me.

03:01.472 --> 03:04.976
Someone who stays up all night and
debates Martin versus Tolkien,

03:05.059 --> 03:06.519
Marvel versus DC...

03:06.603 --> 03:08.104
Big Foot versus the Yeti!

03:08.180 --> 03:10.200
They're the same thing.
I don't give a shit,

03:10.210 --> 03:11.566
which is another problem.

03:11.649 --> 03:14.152
He keeps trying to FaceTime
me while I'm on the toilet.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.679
- That's shitty.
- No, it's the opposite. I'm constipated.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.740
I back him up and he backs me up.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.326
That's just how we roll. We're tight!

03:21.409 --> 03:22.911
Like Trump and Putin.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.369
Scumbags.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.740
He literally has bags
of scum he's fermenting

03:26.760 --> 03:29.042
for a class that he is not in.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.170
I just can't live like this anymore.

03:32.253 --> 03:35.423
Not without telling him
how much he means to me.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.468
Brother!

03:39.594 --> 03:43.848
- Oh, my God!
- Brrrrother!

03:45.225 --> 03:47.685
Um, I can get your ticket,
if you need some me time.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.854
Thanks. Catch you guys later.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.439
I think I need some me time.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.107
Great idea. I'll join you.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.276
Ruby, buy my ticket!

03:57.028 --> 03:58.863
Why are you in line? You
going to the dance?

03:58.947 --> 03:59.990
Hells yeah!

04:00.240 --> 04:02.784
I'm ready to be my old self
again. So don't be scared.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.410
Of what? Two, please!

04:04.494 --> 04:07.538
Of my exceptional dance moves.
I'm gonna win that competition.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.458
Save your money! Your
ticket's been taken care of.

04:10.541 --> 04:12.627
It has? By who?

04:12.710 --> 04:13.920
That's a great question.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.005
You two... follow me!

04:27.680 --> 04:29.560
After deep-diving through
your Insta likes

04:29.580 --> 04:31.688
and cataloging your
crushes over the years

04:31.771 --> 04:33.856
these ladies have all met the pre-reqs.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.692
On a scale from one to freak,

04:35.775 --> 04:37.819
these girls are all up pinky-deep.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.154
While some of them are here
for the wrong reasons,

04:40.530 --> 04:41.948
they all want a shot...

04:42.031 --> 04:45.285
... sorry, chance, to be your
date for the valentine's dance.

04:45.743 --> 04:48.788
- This is disgusting! Ruby, let's get...
- To our seats!

04:49.038 --> 04:50.373
Don't be rude, Monse!

04:50.540 --> 04:51.874
Jasmine made us placards.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.003
To make sure nobody feels
uncomfortable, I invited Monse,

04:55.211 --> 04:56.796
the least sexual person at our school.

04:57.922 --> 04:59.590
You want me to judge these girls?

04:59.710 --> 05:02.260
Hell, no. Ruby is doing the judging.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.090
Your clipboard is, so you can take notes

05:04.178 --> 05:06.222
as to what a girl is supposed
to look and act like.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.182
Contestants?

05:08.266 --> 05:09.559
Are you ready?

05:09.892 --> 05:12.603
- You're calling them contestants?
- What? They like it.

05:13.062 --> 05:15.398
Write this down, "Girls
are competitive."

05:17.150 --> 05:20.361
If anyone's here because they want
to finger Ruby's bullet wound,

05:20.486 --> 05:21.696
please leave now.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.327
And then there were nine.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.995
Okay, first up,

05:29.454 --> 05:30.997
Mia and Ellie.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.874
If you think they look alike,

05:32.957 --> 05:34.584
it's because they're...

05:34.667 --> 05:35.835
... identical twins!

05:36.294 --> 05:38.212
Best part? If one breaks down,

05:38.421 --> 05:39.881
you got a backup.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.049
Next!

05:41.132 --> 05:44.135
Margarita, my girl!

05:44.218 --> 05:45.678
She's funny, she's smart,

05:46.012 --> 05:48.139
and if all of that's not
true... her boobs!

05:48.890 --> 05:50.391
Are any of them good dancers?

05:50.892 --> 05:53.144
You wanna move towards the
dance part of the competition?

05:53.227 --> 05:55.021
I figured we'd weed out a few, but...

05:55.229 --> 05:57.648
Okay, ladies, you heard the man. Dance!

06:12.663 --> 06:15.833
I'm sorry. This is the best I
could do under such short notice.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.461
Okay, this is disgusting
and uncomfortable.

06:18.540 --> 06:21.060
I'm leaving and if anyone
else is feeling objectified,

06:21.070 --> 06:22.382
they should leave too.

06:22.673 --> 06:23.673
Anybody?

06:24.467 --> 06:25.551
Anybody?

06:26.850 --> 06:27.980
Anybody?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.972
Make sure you shut the
door before you go, okay?

06:30.056 --> 06:33.810
The AC is spilling out and these
ladies are already perspiring. Bye!

06:34.560 --> 06:36.229
Okay, ladies,

06:36.354 --> 06:38.523
- you all feel safe, right?
- Yeah! Definitely!

06:38.648 --> 06:39.899
Respected as women?

06:39.982 --> 06:42.276
- Sure.
- Great. Claudia?

06:43.610 --> 06:45.439
Can you just point out to Ruby

06:45.440 --> 06:47.360
and I how far you're willing to go.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.200
You know, base-wise?

06:50.034 --> 06:51.953
Home run!

06:59.335 --> 07:01.087
Too much nose.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.120
If you wanna relax,

07:03.140 --> 07:05.716
you have to breathe with your
diaphragm. Here, watch me!

07:06.175 --> 07:07.593
- Turner!
- Oh, come on.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.846
This dude doesn't understand boundaries.

07:10.721 --> 07:11.889
I need you tomorrow night.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.142
- Are you asking me to the dance?
- No!

07:14.225 --> 07:16.144
I'm chaperoning and now you are too.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.147
I'd love to, but then I'd
have to miss out on the dance

07:19.230 --> 07:22.525
and the dance contest and bragging
about how I won the dance contest.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.402
- Don't you need a date to win it?
- Actually...

07:24.650 --> 07:25.820
I read through the rules

07:25.850 --> 07:27.340
and article 11b states that

07:27.350 --> 07:28.480
technically you don't
need a partner to win.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.658
Before you embarrass
yourself any further,

07:30.741 --> 07:32.452
just remember how much you owe me.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.495
You're still months
away from restitution.

07:34.579 --> 07:35.830
Months?

07:35.913 --> 07:37.206
It can't be months.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.754
Okay, I'll work the dance with you.

07:43.963 --> 07:44.963
Only if...

07:45.381 --> 07:47.216
- you clear my debt.
- The whole thing?

07:47.675 --> 07:49.510
Yeah, he'll even help
you prep and clean up.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.597
Why are we throwing in
unnecessary perks when he hasn't

07:52.680 --> 07:54.056
- made a decision?
- Okay, fine.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.350
And... you should probably
go with him right now

07:56.434 --> 07:58.227
to see exactly what he wants you to do.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.646
Not a bad idea. Let's go pregame this.

08:02.815 --> 08:03.900
You!

08:05.860 --> 08:07.445
- Tik tok's on.
- Coming.

08:16.480 --> 08:17.620
Um,

08:17.705 --> 08:20.833
excuse me, the bell rang
and I have a bio test.

08:22.126 --> 08:25.463
The dance is tomorrow and you're
worried about a bio test?

08:25.713 --> 08:27.131
Your priorities are F'd!

08:27.381 --> 08:28.925
Be gone with ya!

08:29.383 --> 08:30.593
Buh-bye!

08:31.719 --> 08:32.845
Okay.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.640
If I say your name, please step forward.

08:36.557 --> 08:37.557
Sonia.

08:40.227 --> 08:41.227
Ariel.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.899
If I haven't called your name...

08:46.651 --> 08:48.986
you're still in contention!

08:49.070 --> 08:52.740
Sorry, ladies, you do not get
to looby my Ruby. Buh-bye!

08:53.366 --> 08:54.909
Can I talk to you for a minute?

08:54.992 --> 08:56.994
Yeah, of course. Ladies,
let's take five.

08:57.411 --> 09:00.665
Use your time wisely. The
kissing portion is next.

09:00.748 --> 09:01.749
Ooh! Wet them whistles.

09:01.832 --> 09:04.335
- Just so you know, this guy is a biter.
- Yas!

09:04.418 --> 09:06.045
- That's hot.
- I like that.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.040
Hey, was I focused on the wrong asset?

09:08.060 --> 09:09.465
I... I pegged you for a boob guy.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.677
Oh, no, no. Let the record reflect
that I'm totally a boob guy.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.879
And honestly, I had no
idea how many girls

09:14.880 --> 09:16.722
wanted to win me like a backpack.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.392
So thank you for that. I
truly appreciate the effort.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.769
- OMG, it was nothin'.
- Well...

09:22.160 --> 09:24.639
I made my decision and

09:24.640 --> 09:26.600
I don't want to go with any
of the girls in there.

09:27.149 --> 09:29.360
You don't? You haven't fully
explored their talents yet.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.946
Before you try to change my mind,
I think you should know...

09:33.155 --> 09:34.240
I want to go...

09:35.449 --> 09:36.449
with you.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.875
You wan... you wanna go with me?

09:48.300 --> 09:49.380
Does that mean...

09:49.547 --> 09:51.882
- I wanna win the competition!
- you wanna see my third nipple?

09:52.258 --> 09:54.051
- Yeah, yeah, yeah! The dance contest.
- Yeah.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.469
That's cool, too. Yeah.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.180
Okay, uh, we should practice
after school at my place.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.264
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.727
Wait. Should we tell
them that we're leaving?

10:05.646 --> 10:07.231
Oh, no. They'll figure it out.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.742
Jamal wouldn't like this.

10:17.992 --> 10:19.076
So don't tell him.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.040
And you are in your outside clothes.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.834
- No outside clothes on the bed.
- What?

10:26.917 --> 10:30.254
It's a new rule. Jamal just read
this study about germ transference

10:30.338 --> 10:32.381
from outside clothes onto bed covers.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.592
But you're still in
your outside clothes.

10:34.675 --> 10:38.304
No, I changed. This is a different
black tank top and fresh shorts.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.310
Really? Jamal is not even here.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.477
Trust me.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.688
He'll know.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.482
Hey, what's up?

10:49.732 --> 10:50.733
Want your bed back?

10:50.816 --> 10:53.527
- We can bounce.
- Nah, finish what you are doing.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.738
You're on the towel anyway, so...

10:56.197 --> 10:58.366
- I'll be in the master bedroom.
- Got it!

10:59.408 --> 11:00.408
Master bedroom?

11:01.243 --> 11:03.329
He has divided the room into

11:03.412 --> 11:06.040
the master bedroom, which
is that half of the room...

11:06.415 --> 11:09.126
and the living room, which is
the half you're currently in.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.170
But the bed is in the living room.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.798
If you try to make sense of it,
you'll drive yourself crazy.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.591
You see what I am dealing with?

11:15.925 --> 11:18.010
These rules are ridiculous.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.471
But it could be worse.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.767
You need to lean out of the
frustration and into the gratitude.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.311
You can still find a silver
lining in all of this.

11:28.396 --> 11:31.691
You're not on the streets.
You're on a towel... in a bed.

11:32.900 --> 11:33.900
Yeah.

11:39.156 --> 11:40.282
I should probably go.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.284
Does your mom know you
haven't told your dad?

11:42.368 --> 11:43.911
Do I have to tell her?

11:44.495 --> 11:47.123
I plan on telling my dad tomorrow
when he gets home, so telling her

11:47.206 --> 11:49.041
- feels like a double tell.
- I don't know.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.378
I feel like maybe you should lean
out of the fear into the honesty.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.881
Mmm. I'll tell them tomorrow.
Enjoy your towel.

12:01.950 --> 12:03.013
Oh, shit!

12:03.097 --> 12:04.140
No shit!

12:07.351 --> 12:08.853
I need to talk to my daughter,

12:08.936 --> 12:09.936
alone.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.608
I don't get it. I
thought we were a team.

12:14.692 --> 12:15.692
We are.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.237
I never intended on
keeping this a secret.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.864
I was trying to find a
way to not upset you.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.032
I get that you are trying to
understand where you came from

12:22.116 --> 12:23.784
but this is not how you do it.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.412
- You don't sneak around.
- Come on, T, please don't punish her.

12:28.038 --> 12:29.123
Stay out of this.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.459
Would you even be looking for
Monse if she hadn't found you?

12:31.542 --> 12:33.002
I thought about her all the time.

12:33.377 --> 12:34.377
That's nice.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.757
Must have been hard for you
thinking about her in Brentwood

12:37.840 --> 12:40.134
while I was raising her in Freeridge.

12:41.135 --> 12:43.345
I can't believe you were
just ten miles away.

12:43.804 --> 12:45.848
Dad, please don't do this to Julia.

12:46.760 --> 12:47.850
Julia?

12:48.184 --> 12:49.184
Her name is Selena.

12:50.978 --> 12:51.979
I don't know you.

12:52.396 --> 12:54.440
- You're a stranger.
- Not anymore.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.527
- I want Monse to come stay with me.
- No way.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.780
This isn't a safe
environment for anyone.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.991
Let alone a fourteen-year-old girl
who has to take care of herself.

13:04.366 --> 13:07.244
You can't protect her when
you're gone for weeks at a time.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.456
And I wanna know her too, Dad.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.752
You really wanna know her?

13:16.337 --> 13:17.337
Just watch.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.007
Watch her walk away.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.261
Monse, I'll see you inside.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.514
Good night, Selena.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.891
Or whatever the hell you go by now.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.298
I was just about to call you.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.884
- I need to talk something out.
- Hold on. Me first.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.037
I've been thinking about the
silver lining and you're right.

14:07.555 --> 14:08.848
I'm gonna get through this.

14:08.880 --> 14:09.920
Of course you are.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.851
Never really felt like
a given to me, but...

14:11.934 --> 14:13.828
knowing you're always nearby
means everything to me.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.312
I feel the same way.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.482
So, what you wanna talk, huh?

14:20.734 --> 14:22.945
Oh, nothing major. Just...

14:24.113 --> 14:25.489
wondering if...

14:27.199 --> 14:28.951
... I should wear a
dress tomorrow night.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.327
No, yes, no?

14:30.661 --> 14:32.246
Is this a trick question?

14:32.496 --> 14:34.536
You should wear whatever
makes you feel comfortable.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.626
In that case, I'm rollin' in my hoodie.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.670
Well, you look good in anything.

14:39.750 --> 14:40.800
Or...

14:40.820 --> 14:41.900
nothing.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.600
Good night.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.810
Good night.

14:52.516 --> 14:54.101
You two need to get a room.

14:54.351 --> 14:55.477
Just not this one.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.649
The boning bleachers,

15:00.941 --> 15:02.818
the hookup hallways,

15:03.360 --> 15:05.237
the reach-around restroom.

15:07.197 --> 15:10.451
I'm sorry. I'm not all caught up
on whatever you call sex nowadays.

15:10.534 --> 15:11.702
Sex, we call it sex.

15:11.785 --> 15:14.914
But what I do know is that if
there's a blind spot in that gym,

15:14.997 --> 15:16.916
someone's gonna try and
stick their penis in it.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.918
- Ugh.
- And that's where you come in.

15:19.209 --> 15:21.337
- It is?
- Be sure to check your corners,

15:21.462 --> 15:22.963
behind decorations,

15:23.255 --> 15:25.215
- underneath band geeks.
- Um-hmm.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.468
There'll be crying girls
trying to get your attention.

15:27.800 --> 15:28.844
Decoys!

15:28.928 --> 15:29.970
Don't fall for it!

15:30.054 --> 15:31.555
- Let's check your supply!
- Okay.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.557
- Breathalyzer?
- Check!

15:33.641 --> 15:35.976
- Water bottle? Sani wipes?
- Check!

15:36.060 --> 15:38.687
And check! Have to make
some room on my belt.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.397
Bought some of my own supplies.

15:40.750 --> 15:41.780
Weird.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.940
But if it helps make sure
no student gives birth

15:43.960 --> 15:45.110
nine months from tonight,

15:45.402 --> 15:47.404
- then I'm on board.
- Don't worry, Coach,

15:47.488 --> 15:49.949
think of me as a human contraceptive.

16:00.580 --> 16:01.650
Need a hand?

16:01.877 --> 16:04.213
My brother tied ties for me.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.215
What about your dad?

16:07.091 --> 16:08.467
Barely know him.

16:15.683 --> 16:17.142
Thanks for allowing me to stay.

16:18.143 --> 16:20.813
You are in an impossible situation

16:20.896 --> 16:23.023
that no kid should ever
have to go through.

16:23.691 --> 16:26.568
And you've been a grounding
presence for Jamal.

16:28.904 --> 16:32.783
Okay, that... that's a lie. Jamal
is still very, very weird.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.534
Yeah.

16:37.037 --> 16:39.581
I'm gonna make it up to you
someday. For all your help.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.959
Well, you can't tie a tie...

16:42.835 --> 16:43.919
but can you tie an apron?

16:44.837 --> 16:46.880
I could always use an
extra hand at Dwayne's.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.170
Really?

16:48.674 --> 16:50.134
Yeah, I'd love that.

16:52.219 --> 16:53.219
Okay.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.639
O... kay.

16:55.848 --> 16:56.849
I think...

16:57.933 --> 17:00.477
we are all set here.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.233
- We might need to YouTube this.
- Yeah.

17:07.317 --> 17:08.317
Yeah.

17:13.949 --> 17:14.949
Can I help?

17:22.124 --> 17:23.916
Man, you are growing up too fast.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.505
Listen, um...

17:29.798 --> 17:30.883
I'm sorry.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.011
I get why you wanna know your mom,
and you should know who she is.

17:34.386 --> 17:36.680
- I'm just trying to protect you.
- I know, Dad.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.308
But what if there is nothing
to protect me from?

17:39.641 --> 17:41.101
What if she's really changed?

17:41.643 --> 17:42.643
It's possible.

17:45.730 --> 17:46.820
Maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea

17:46.830 --> 17:48.734
to get you out of Freeridge for a while.

17:52.946 --> 17:53.946
No.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.200
No, I don't want to leave.

17:56.825 --> 17:57.825
This is my home.

17:59.536 --> 18:00.829

18:40.619 --> 18:43.372
Outside Ruben is working
the inside tonight.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.040
That's right, baby.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.542
That's why we have to go last!

18:46.625 --> 18:48.043
No, first!

18:48.410 --> 18:50.199
We set the bar impossibly high

18:50.200 --> 18:51.755
and destroy the hopes of everyone else.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.632
No, we have to go last!

18:53.715 --> 18:55.509
The DJ determines the winner,

18:55.592 --> 18:58.137
and everybody knows that DJs
have short attention spans

18:58.220 --> 18:59.860
and bad memories, or else, hello,

18:59.880 --> 19:01.932
they'd wake up and pick
a different profession.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.559
That's science, Ruby.

19:07.810 --> 19:10.420
What do you guys think?
Should we go first or last?

19:10.440 --> 19:11.798
I don't think it'll matter

19:11.799 --> 19:14.319
because Monse and I might
have this in the bag.

19:14.403 --> 19:15.946
That's a terrible idea.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.823
You don't think we can pull it off?

19:17.906 --> 19:19.116
It's not you, it's me.

19:19.199 --> 19:21.701
And my feelings about how
bad of a dancer you are.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.540
Cesar, buddy, you don't wanna bring

19:23.570 --> 19:25.247
more attention to yourself by dancing.

19:25.270 --> 19:27.520
You already got enough with that jacket.

19:27.540 --> 19:29.540
Which brings me to my next question:

19:29.835 --> 19:30.961
what is that jacket?

19:31.086 --> 19:34.089
Yo! Bruce looks good on you, bruh!

19:34.173 --> 19:37.426
- Ugh! You named this?
- So you're to blame for this eyesore?

19:37.634 --> 19:38.677
Don't listen to him.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.095
He's not fashion forward.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.347
When, exactly, did you
purchase this jacket?

19:42.431 --> 19:47.561
Well... back when it was my cheddar,
I shredded off a little of it.

19:47.853 --> 19:51.064
But, now that it's our gouda,

19:51.148 --> 19:54.276
I have a sliced off a
dime-sized piece of that fella.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.361
- Turner!
- I'm on a break, Ronald.

19:56.445 --> 19:57.571
There are no breaks

19:57.654 --> 20:00.032
when there are teenage boys
trying to stick it in.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.783
I misplaced my phone.

20:01.992 --> 20:02.992
Check the office.

20:07.372 --> 20:10.167
I'm happy to know someone won't
be sticking it in tonight.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.752
Not with that jacket.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.337
Ah, signal!

20:13.503 --> 20:17.799
Ladies and gents, the Valentine
dance competition is starting!

20:24.848 --> 20:27.434
Where did he forget his
phone? Where's the phone?

20:29.937 --> 20:34.483
Oh, wait. Oh! Ha-ha! I found
the phone! I found the phone.

20:38.570 --> 20:39.571
Oh!

20:40.697 --> 20:41.697
Oh!

20:51.959 --> 20:53.877
Yo! Watch yourself, fleshlight.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.588
You. Watch yourself...

20:57.381 --> 20:58.423
lava lamp.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.637
Yo! What are you doing?

21:03.720 --> 21:04.720
You know what?

21:05.514 --> 21:06.974
Hugs before thugs.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.397
Coach.

21:14.550 --> 21:15.649
Found my phone?

21:15.941 --> 21:17.776
I'm gonna tell you the cold hard truth.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.823
- Someone hooked it.
- What?

21:24.241 --> 21:26.118
Someone has my phone.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.412
That same someone

21:28.996 --> 21:31.540
is the reason you are
no longer having fun.

21:32.791 --> 21:37.129
This individual has five
seconds to return my phone.

21:37.671 --> 21:41.883
If they return my phone
before I get to five,

21:42.592 --> 21:44.011
the dance can continue.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.264
If not, the night is canceled.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.351
Now I'm gonna turn around, so
I don't even know who did it.

21:54.521 --> 21:55.521
One.

21:58.275 --> 21:59.275
Two.

22:00.485 --> 22:03.572
Three! I better start hearing movement.

22:03.850 --> 22:04.990
Four!

22:05.073 --> 22:07.951
Oh! Don't let me get to five.

22:09.244 --> 22:10.912
Four and a half!

22:13.707 --> 22:14.707
Five!

22:16.960 --> 22:18.128
Cowards!

22:18.962 --> 22:19.962
All of you!

22:23.258 --> 22:24.468
Is that how you wanna play?

22:25.218 --> 22:27.554
We can play it that way.

22:27.929 --> 22:30.766
I've got the human find-my-phone app.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.727
Jamal, do your thing.

22:42.736 --> 22:43.820
Oh. Oh.

22:50.869 --> 22:51.953
Oh, shit.

22:52.412 --> 22:54.623
Tyrone, my office, now!

22:55.624 --> 22:56.708
Resume the dance.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.593
Thank you, Hobby and Xavier.

23:06.676 --> 23:10.013
Next up, everybody make some
noise for The Great Jazz B.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.141
- It's okay if you want to bail.
- No.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.936
If you want to win, we have
to do this. I'm ready.

24:13.243 --> 24:16.329
The Great Jazz B has just
won a $50 gift card to...

24:16.913 --> 24:18.540
Chili's!

24:18.623 --> 24:21.626
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Guys, guys!

24:21.710 --> 24:24.463
If we pull our cards right, we can
stretch this out to two dinners.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.882
Four meals if we eat order off
the kid's menu and we don't tip.

24:26.965 --> 24:29.593
But that's up to you. We won!

24:30.802 --> 24:33.763
All right. All right. All
right. Freeridge High!

24:33.847 --> 24:35.682
It's time to take it old school!

24:50.030 --> 24:51.990

Everything is all right.

25:20.477 --> 25:21.561
Okay. You're safe.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.066
I'll go get him some water.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.170
What's going on?

25:30.237 --> 25:32.237
It's the song that was
playing when they were shot.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.451
Hey, go, go. I got this.

25:45.835 --> 25:47.212
Baby, it's okay.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.173
It's okay. You're not ready.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.888
I just want to be myself again.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.193
Hey. Hey.

26:12.050 --> 26:13.113
You okay?

26:14.823 --> 26:15.824
Come here.

26:22.497 --> 26:24.457
Anything can change in a moment.

26:25.792 --> 26:28.295
One day the world's a dream;
the next, it's a nightmare.

26:31.381 --> 26:33.008
I can't believe she's gone.

26:34.467 --> 26:37.137
That's why we have to live
our lives to the fullest.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.264
We can't have any regrets.

26:56.781 --> 26:57.866
I need to go.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.118
Yeah, okay.

27:01.369 --> 27:03.455
- Let's go.
- No. No.

27:04.789 --> 27:06.708
I need to go stay with my mom.

27:09.794 --> 27:11.212
What are you talking about?

27:11.296 --> 27:13.882
She asked me to come live
with her, in Brentwood.

27:15.133 --> 27:16.760
I have to go or I'll regret it.

27:16.843 --> 27:18.219
You barely know this woman.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.013
Yeah, that's why I have to do it.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.766
No, no, please. Don't leave me.

27:23.099 --> 27:25.060
- I need you.
- I'm not leaving you.

27:25.518 --> 27:27.312
I'm not leaving you,
I'm leaving Freeridge.

27:27.390 --> 27:28.720
And it will only be for a little while.

27:28.750 --> 27:30.275
If you leave, we're finished.

27:34.944 --> 27:35.945
You don't mean that.

27:37.989 --> 27:38.989
Yes, I do.

27:44.537 --> 27:45.622
Don't do this to me.

27:46.539 --> 27:47.624
It's your choice.

28:07.769 --> 28:10.522
Of course you would leave. You
really are your mother's daughter.

28:19.823 --> 28:20.823
We're done.

28:30.291 --> 28:33.586
- Yo! What's wrong?
- We just broke up.

28:37.966 --> 28:38.967
Cesar, wait!

28:40.009 --> 28:41.678
- Hey.
- I have to go.

28:41.761 --> 28:44.472
Huh! You've got to work the whole dance.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.725
That was our agreement. Hey, listen.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.477
If you leave now, deal's done.

28:52.021 --> 28:53.021
Then it's done.
