WEBVTT

00:36.411 --> 00:38.038
WOMAN:
Help you find something?

00:38.121 --> 00:41.541
Uh, no, thanks. I'm just browsing.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.827
That still works.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.746
You can plug it in if you want.

01:19.829 --> 01:22.624
Oh. Thanks.

02:41.369 --> 02:42.453
How much for this?

02:43.621 --> 02:45.123
That?

02:46.124 --> 02:47.458
I could let that go for 30.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.671
Uh, seventy-five for all three?

04:32.897 --> 04:34.357
Yeah, don't worry about it.

04:34.440 --> 04:37.652
Building will take care of it.
That's what you pay rent for.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.406
What's your day look like?

04:41.489 --> 04:45.076
I got MDC in the morning
and court in the afternoon.

04:45.159 --> 04:48.496
Oh, and I'm finally doing that lunch
with Howard.

04:48.579 --> 04:49.664
Yeah?

04:49.747 --> 04:51.124
See what he wants.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.459
Hopefully it will be short and sweet. You?

04:54.502 --> 04:55.461
Uh...

04:56.462 --> 04:58.840
Yesterday was bad.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.926
Today, I'm gonna fix it.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.845
Sounds like a plan.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.430
See you.

05:09.225 --> 05:13.146
KIM:
Pull the initial research we did on Lot 2375.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.149
Yeah.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.900
Yeah, all of it.

05:19.402 --> 05:23.531
Uh, permit status, costs, projections.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.201
Uh-huh. Are they on digital?

05:27.285 --> 05:29.912
Good. How are you on PowerPoint?

05:30.580 --> 05:33.207
Great. I'll walk you through
what I need when I get in.

05:33.291 --> 05:37.086
I should be there in 20.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.298
I'll see you when I get there.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.104
You gentlemen have had a busy week, huh?

05:57.648 --> 05:59.484
Bail has been denied.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.486
No mystery there.

06:04.614 --> 06:08.618
Okay. Let's start at the beginning.
Somehow, you two are short on priors,

06:08.701 --> 06:13.122
so I think I can get the DA to knock
the drug charges down to simple possession.

06:13.206 --> 06:18.211
We can lay responsibility for the felonies
at the doorstep of your unfortunate dependence

06:18.294 --> 06:21.547
on hard drugs, but we're gonna have to argue
for rehab as part of probation--

06:21.631 --> 06:23.257
Hells, no. I hate rehab.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.302
All right. Don't get all in a twist, okay?

06:27.303 --> 06:31.641
I've heard that there exist
certain less-than-reputable establishments

06:31.724 --> 06:37.021
that will provide certification without the pleasure
of your actual attendance.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.523
You know a place like that?

06:38.606 --> 06:41.609
I could conceivably find such a place
for an additional fee.

06:41.692 --> 06:43.694
-All right, because I ain't going to no rehab.
-Mm.

06:43.778 --> 06:46.489
You go, you don't go.
That's between you and your God.

06:46.572 --> 06:50.743
But you gotta tell the judge you'll go,
and you gotta sound like you mean it, okay?

06:50.827 --> 06:52.578
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah, okay.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.665
Well, all that's left is your many,
many misdemeanors,

06:55.748 --> 06:59.418
which include graffiti, vandalism,

06:59.502 --> 07:02.046
littering, public urination.

07:03.089 --> 07:06.008
Nature's calling you, you gotta answer it.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.929
Hold it too long, you get kidney-stoned.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.893
Be that as it may, even misdemeanors add up,

07:15.977 --> 07:19.897
so if I can get you concurrent sentences,
you're looking at...

07:21.441 --> 07:23.234
12 months in stir.

07:23.317 --> 07:28.322
Now, with good behavior and overcrowding,
takes it down to six, maybe five months.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.907
That's minimum security.

07:29.991 --> 07:33.703
It's gonna be like taking a cruise,
only less danger of drowning.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.079
Christ, man, five months?

07:35.163 --> 07:40.251
Down from five years, consecutive, or worse,
if they get this heavy stuff to stick.

07:40.334 --> 07:41.335
Now, come on.

07:41.419 --> 07:44.255
You do your months,
you do a little community service,

07:44.338 --> 07:47.884
maybe a year probation,
and you're gold, Ponyboy. Sound good?

07:49.302 --> 07:51.971
Yeah, okay. Yeah, we can take that.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.139
No doubt.

07:53.222 --> 07:56.684
Great. So all that's left is my fee.

07:56.767 --> 08:01.230
Ahem. Okay, so for my time,
court costs, filing fees,

08:01.314 --> 08:04.025
you're looking at, oh, let's say about...

08:05.526 --> 08:07.278
four grand, all-in.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.491
-Say what?
-Yo, don't play us like that.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.618
What about 50 percent off?

08:13.701 --> 08:17.371
That is 50 percent off.
Now, my normal rate would be 4K each.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.457
Dude, this is B.S.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.960
They got lawyers here they gotta give us.
You pay nothing.

08:23.044 --> 08:26.422
-Free lawyers?
-Public 'fenders.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.258
Four grand, we can get a lot of scante, man.

08:29.342 --> 08:33.804
I'm sorry. Free lawyer? Are you saying
that you want a free lawyer?

08:33.888 --> 08:38.643
-We're just talking over options.
-And, you know, free is, you know, free.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.729
Did you ever hear the phrase,
"you get what you pay for," you nudnik?

08:41.812 --> 08:44.649
Without me, they're gonna lock you up
and throw away the key.

08:44.732 --> 08:47.360
I'm sorry. Did I say "five years"?

08:47.443 --> 08:50.363
You go ahead and play Russian roulette
with a public pretender,

08:50.446 --> 08:53.241
you're gonna end up doing a decade in Los Lunas.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.826
You twerps even know who I am?

08:55.910 --> 08:58.246
I am Saul Goodman.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.331
Okay? You think 4K is too much?

09:00.414 --> 09:03.834
Yesterday, I got paid 8K just for the afternoon.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.462
That's how good I am. I am the real deal.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.756
You're lucky I'm even talking to you.

09:08.839 --> 09:11.300
You know what? Heh.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.556
-Hey, come on, man. Don't be like that.
-Hey, all right. Hey, we're sorry, yo. We're sorry.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.141
-You. We-- We wanna go with you.
-Hunny-percent.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.977
Please, sir?

09:24.021 --> 09:25.690
Okay.

09:25.773 --> 09:28.359
We're back on the same page, though.
Payment.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.069
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

09:31.445 --> 09:33.781
Before you make my headache even worse,

09:33.864 --> 09:37.451
no, you cannot pay me with the money you stole.

09:37.535 --> 09:40.079
Okay, that cash is Exhibit A for the prosecution.

09:40.162 --> 09:44.041
So, relatives?
Anybody you haven't already fleeced?

09:45.293 --> 09:46.544
My grandma, maybe?

09:46.627 --> 09:48.379
Yeah, she got a house,

09:48.462 --> 09:51.090
-Yeah.
-and a car and shizz.

09:51.173 --> 09:52.425
Yeah, grandma. She's perfect.

09:52.508 --> 09:55.636
Okay, so you tell granny,
faster she gets me my money,

09:55.720 --> 09:57.096
faster I work my magic.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.682
My wire info is on the back of that card.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.350
I look forward to hearing from her.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.312
Coming out!

10:24.957 --> 10:27.627
I'm sorry I'm late. It's just one of those days.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.211
No problem. Let me introduce you.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.005
Judge Lawler, this is Jimmy McGill.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.591
Uh, actually, it's Saul Goodman.
I changed my name.

10:33.674 --> 10:37.803
But Lawler? Now, you're federal, right?
District of New Mexico?

10:37.887 --> 10:39.055
That's me.

10:39.138 --> 10:42.433
Thought so. Your gavel work is legendary.

10:42.516 --> 10:44.894
Uh, thank you?

10:44.977 --> 10:47.855
I'll let you get back to your lunch.
Catch you on the back nine next week.

10:47.938 --> 10:48.981
See you.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.149
Jimmy?

10:50.232 --> 10:53.069
-And I'll have the sole and--
-No butter, side of steamed veggies?

10:53.152 --> 10:54.987
You got me. Creature of habit.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.782
Great. I'll put this in,
I'll be right back with your drink.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.457
So...

11:07.458 --> 11:10.461
Saul Goodman.
Am I allowed to call you Jimmy?

11:10.544 --> 11:15.383
Uh, Saul Goodman is my professional name,
but my friends still call me Jimmy.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.801
You can too.

11:16.884 --> 11:18.969
Well, tell me about Saul Goodman.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.055
What do you mean?

11:21.138 --> 11:25.851
Well, what I mean is,
if he's not Jimmy McGill, who is he?

11:26.852 --> 11:27.812
What's he about?

11:28.813 --> 11:30.689
Hmm. Well...

11:32.775 --> 11:38.781
Saul Goodman is, um...
He's the last line of defense for the little guy.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.866
Are you getting sold down the river?

11:40.950 --> 11:42.451
He's a life raft.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.955
You getting stepped on, he's a sharp stick.

11:46.038 --> 11:49.917
You got Goliath on your back,
Saul's the guy with the slingshot.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.588
He's a righter of wrongs.
He's friend to the friendless.

11:54.672 --> 11:55.881
That's Saul Goodman.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.300
Wow.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.056
Couldn't Jimmy McGill do all that?

12:06.684 --> 12:10.771
Maybe he could, but Saul Goodman is.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.023
I get it.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.275
You do?

12:14.358 --> 12:17.903
Yeah. I understand
why you changed your name.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.114
Is that right?

12:21.157 --> 12:23.826
Hamlin Hamlin McGill did you wrong.

12:23.909 --> 12:28.914
Your name is a part of that firm. Now it's tainted.
We took your legacy away from you.

12:28.998 --> 12:32.168
-If you say so, Howard.
-No, no, I've been thinking about this a lot.

12:32.251 --> 12:35.129
And you know what?
We should have hired you.

12:35.212 --> 12:38.716
I mean, don't worry about it.
That's ancient history.

12:38.799 --> 12:40.843
You deserved a shot.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.930
And I could've given it to you when you got barred
or when you brought us Sandpiper.

12:45.014 --> 12:49.268
Both times, I should've shown some backbone.
It would've been the right thing to do.

12:49.351 --> 12:54.356
Wow. I am glad you had this cleansing moment
of clarity, Howard.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.025
Good for you.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.946
Let me be clear.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.032
I'm not interested in yesterday.

13:03.115 --> 13:07.453
I missed an opportunity with you,
and I think it's time to correct that.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.624
I'd like you to come work at HHM.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.508
Ah...

13:21.509 --> 13:25.095
You want me to work for you
after all the shit that's happened between us?

13:25.179 --> 13:27.932
Oh, as far as I'm concerned,
that's between you and Chuck.

13:32.895 --> 13:38.901
Hey, look, before you offer me a job,
you might want to call your buddy, Cliff Main.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.529
He'd have a unique perspective
on employing me.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.948
This isn't a spur-of-the-moment decision, Jimmy.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.867
I have been considering this for a while.

13:48.118 --> 13:51.914
At the scholarship committee,
you spoke about that young woman.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.291
Kristy Esposito.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.793
Yes. Kristy.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.128
-Yeah.
-You stood up for her.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.047
And that got me thinking.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.049
About judgment

14:02.383 --> 14:04.093
and honesty.

14:05.010 --> 14:09.640
Heh. And when you kicked my ass last year,
you weren't wrong.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.393
You say what you mean.

14:13.435 --> 14:16.230
Listen, you don't wanna be surrounded
by liars, Howard,

14:16.313 --> 14:17.898
you might be in the wrong profession.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.234
Look, it's simple for me.

14:20.317 --> 14:24.655
You're smart. You're scrappy.
You're a go-getter.

14:24.738 --> 14:27.533
You don't wait for things to happen.
You make them happen.

14:27.616 --> 14:31.579
HHM is growing again
and could use someone like you.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.874
I could use you.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.710
Charlie Hustle.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.964
-Howard, I--
-You don't have to answer right now.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.300
Let's just enjoy lunch.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.885
But do me a favor.

14:46.969 --> 14:50.097
Live with it for a bit. Okay?

15:04.236 --> 15:06.780
HOWARD:
Ah. That's me.

15:06.864 --> 15:10.075
JIMMY:
Well, Howard, this was, um...

15:12.411 --> 15:13.913
Thanks for lunch.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.623
I'll get the next one.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.541
Thanks for taking the time.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.710
Good to see you, Jimmy.

15:49.406 --> 15:50.866
PAIGE:
If you glance at the package,

15:50.950 --> 15:53.160
it'll give you a clear idea
of what we're talking about.

15:53.243 --> 15:57.748
There's a raft of TCPA compliance issues,
but they're fairly straightforward.

15:57.831 --> 16:02.670
We've been in touch with the FTC,
the FCC, OSHA, same.

16:02.753 --> 16:07.549
By the time construction's complete, we'll be able
to hire able bodies, and we'll be ready to go.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.177
Exciting to expand
beyond the old brick and mortar.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.888
We've hit all the key benchmarks
for the Tucumcari call center.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.933
-And we remain well under budget.
KEVIN: You know I like to hear that.

16:16.016 --> 16:19.520
PAIGE: All right. If you turn to the next tab,
there are some mortgage opportunities--

16:19.603 --> 16:24.024
Sorry. Paige, there's one more piece
of call center business I feel we need to discuss.

16:24.108 --> 16:27.486
PAIGE: Oh. Okay.
-Stef?

16:30.155 --> 16:34.994
We decided to put this center here,
on this parcel of land, Lot 1102.

16:35.077 --> 16:40.791
But I think we need to reconsider
the other contender, Lot 2375.

16:40.874 --> 16:45.004
PAIGE: Twenty-three seventy-five.
The vacant lot with the flooding problem?

16:45.087 --> 16:46.338
KIM:
Yes, that's right.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.799
Initially, we did have concerns
about the infrastructure,

16:48.882 --> 16:51.552
but I spoke with Alex Amadeo
on the council this morning,

16:51.635 --> 16:57.182
and she told me the city has recently shored up
all of the drainage along the arroyo.

16:57.266 --> 17:01.103
And they have repaved 10 miles of roads
in the vicinity.

17:01.186 --> 17:07.443
So that would not only speed up our construction,
but make for a more efficient operation overall.

17:07.526 --> 17:12.364
And over the long term, it seems to me
that these improvements will pay dividends

17:12.448 --> 17:14.366
and more than offset any delays.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.660
Since we won't need a redesign,

17:16.744 --> 17:21.749
we could be back on track
in a matter of two to three weeks, maybe less.

17:21.832 --> 17:24.168
Are you saying that we lose three weeks

17:24.251 --> 17:27.504
and, what, eat the cost of the land
that we already own?

17:28.922 --> 17:32.259
I know this isn't really my department,
but according to our own projections,

17:32.342 --> 17:37.181
the land we already own will more than double
in value in the next five years.

17:37.264 --> 17:40.267
This could be an excellent investment.

17:40.350 --> 17:45.481
There's potential here to turn Tucumcari
into a real Mesa Verde company town.

17:46.482 --> 17:50.736
And when you add in the reputational risk
with Lot 1102--

17:50.819 --> 17:54.406
Reputational risk?
You're talking about Everett Acker?

17:55.616 --> 17:59.661
Ousting a man from his house,
it's never a good look.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.747
KEVIN:
Kim, let me ask this real plainly.

18:01.830 --> 18:04.792
Is Lot 1102 our land or not?

18:04.875 --> 18:06.794
Are we in the right?

18:08.045 --> 18:10.130
As far as the law goes, yes.

18:10.214 --> 18:13.133
KEVIN:
Well, all right, then. Well, that settles it.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.885
I'm not gonna let anybody chase me off.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.805
This fella wants to make a fuss, well...

18:17.888 --> 18:20.432
It's our land and our right
to do with it what we want.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.934
I agree.

18:22.017 --> 18:24.019
We've already offered him a sum
for relocation

18:24.103 --> 18:26.438
far greater than what we've paid
any of his neighbors.

18:26.522 --> 18:29.775
KEVIN:
Kim, thank you for the thought,

18:29.858 --> 18:32.528
but I say we move forward with Lot 1102.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.405
How about we get the lights?

18:36.698 --> 18:38.826
Yeah, all right, then. That's that.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.203
I just had to mention it.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.916
I've got a call in to the sheriff.

18:45.999 --> 18:50.003
Come Friday at noon,
Acker will be out and construction will proceed.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.923
Now, as I was saying, mortgages.

18:53.006 --> 18:55.217
Our institutional clients are strong,

18:55.300 --> 18:57.636
but if we want to penetrate the retail market,

18:57.719 --> 19:01.348
there are some opportunities that we
should explore as we develop the business.

19:25.497 --> 19:28.167
Pop, what are you doing here?

19:28.250 --> 19:29.877
It's Thursday. It's my day.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.380
You didn't get my message?
I called you to see if you were coming.

19:33.463 --> 19:36.967
You never called me back,
so I had Emily come.

19:37.050 --> 19:40.304
It's okay. Send her home.
I'll pay her for the night.

19:42.014 --> 19:45.434
Well, maybe it's better
if you just sit this one out.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.270
I mean, they're already off, playing dolls.

19:48.353 --> 19:52.191
I scared her. I lost my temper. That's it.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.612
-If you just let me talk to her, tell her I'm sorry--
-No, no, no. Kaylee's fine.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.072
She forgot all about that.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.076
Then what's the problem?

20:04.912 --> 20:07.080
I love you, Pop,

20:07.164 --> 20:10.876
but tonight, I think you should let Emily babysit.

20:13.128 --> 20:16.673
Honey, I'm okay.
I wouldn't tell you I was okay if I wasn't.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.635
And if Kaylee brings up Matty?

20:24.514 --> 20:25.974
I'll be okay.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.102
You're getting worked up over nothing. I'm fine.

20:29.186 --> 20:33.398
Look, what if maybe you come for dinner
sometime next week?

20:33.482 --> 20:36.068
We can have those pork chops you like.

20:36.151 --> 20:39.446
You've been working so hard.
You deserve a little break.

20:39.529 --> 20:41.907
Let you get back to yourself.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.494
Get back to myself?

20:48.705 --> 20:51.458
Something's going on with you.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.043
I don't know what.

20:53.126 --> 20:56.797
But I'd be more comfortable
if you didn't sit for Kaylee.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.299
For tonight.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.293
HARKNESS: We were hopping
because of that Kiss show at the pavilion.

21:34.376 --> 21:39.006
I had those leather guys in makeup coming in
and buying Slim Jims and beers all night long.

21:39.089 --> 21:40.507
KO:
Thank you. Mr. Harkness.

21:40.590 --> 21:43.885
Is the person who robbed you present
in the court today?

21:43.969 --> 21:45.429
HARKNESS:
Yes.

21:45.512 --> 21:48.765
And could you point him out
to the court, please?

21:48.849 --> 21:49.683
There.

21:49.766 --> 21:54.021
Let the record show that the witness
has identified the defendant, Mr. Sakey.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.564
Thank you, Mr. Harkness.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.274
CHAPEK:
Your witness, Mr. Goodman.

21:59.234 --> 22:01.111
Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Harkness.

22:01.194 --> 22:05.073
I just want to clarify a few things
from your testimony, if that's okay.

22:05.157 --> 22:05.991
Okay.

22:06.074 --> 22:10.078
So you were working at the Sandia Mart
the night of the 30th. Is that correct?

22:10.162 --> 22:11.830
HARKNESS:
Got in at noon, left at midnight.

22:11.913 --> 22:14.541
SAUL: That's a long day. Good for you.
HARKNESS: Mm-hm.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.376
Nothing wrong with a hard day's work.

22:16.460 --> 22:20.005
So you say a man came in,
and he reached across the counter

22:20.088 --> 22:22.841
and, quote,

22:22.924 --> 22:26.636
"He grabbed up the money
from my register and run off."

22:26.720 --> 22:28.472
Yeah.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.557
And there was no one else in the store?

22:30.640 --> 22:32.976
Not at that time, no.

22:33.060 --> 22:36.271
And since the camera system wasn't working
at the time,

22:36.354 --> 22:39.858
you're the only one who saw the perpetrator.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.318
Yeah. I guess so.

22:45.572 --> 22:46.406
Yeah.

22:46.490 --> 22:49.493
So this person came in,
and they bought something.

22:49.576 --> 22:52.162
-I think it was an Almond Joy.
-And they bought an Almond Joy.

22:52.245 --> 22:53.830
And when you rang them up,

22:53.914 --> 22:57.000
that's when they snatched the cash
from the register.

22:57.084 --> 23:01.546
Sounds like it happened pretty fast,
but you say you got a good look at them, correct?

23:01.630 --> 23:02.756
Yes.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.928
You must drink stronger coffee than I do,
because after 11 hours on the job,

23:08.011 --> 23:10.889
I can barely see straight. And it was dark out.

23:10.972 --> 23:13.892
HARKNESS: He was the only guy that came in
that night that wasn't made up

23:13.975 --> 23:17.312
like a bat or a cat or whatever the hell
those guys are.

23:17.395 --> 23:19.773
And he was right up in my face.

23:19.856 --> 23:20.690
Right in your face?

23:20.774 --> 23:24.152
And according to your testimony,
you feel confident

23:24.236 --> 23:25.779
that you can identify this person.

23:25.862 --> 23:29.116
-That's what you're saying.
-I can, absolutely.

23:30.117 --> 23:33.036
It's him. Your client.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.915
Are you sure that's the person?
There's no doubt in your mind? Take your time.

23:36.998 --> 23:39.292
I don't need time. That's him.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.837
Now, would you be surprised to learn,
Mr. Harkness,

23:41.920 --> 23:44.798
that the person you just pointed to
is not the defendant?

23:47.217 --> 23:49.553
-What?
-My client is in the back of the courtroom.

23:49.636 --> 23:52.222
-Mr. Sakey, would you please stand up?
KO: Objection.

23:52.305 --> 23:56.768
The person you ID'd is named Hollis Earley.
He's a bartender down in Belen.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.062
He has a very good alibi
for the night in question.

23:59.146 --> 24:03.692
-Your Honor, objection!
-Oh, Mr. Goodman! Really?

24:03.775 --> 24:08.238
-You didn't recognize him, either, Your Honor.
-All right, settle down, everybody. Settle. Settle.

24:12.492 --> 24:15.287
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
we're gonna call it a day.

24:16.288 --> 24:20.375
I will have very specific instructions
for you tomorrow.

24:20.458 --> 24:23.461
As always, please refrain
from discussing the case until then,

24:23.545 --> 24:27.757
and I will see counsel in my chambers now.

24:27.841 --> 24:28.675
Adjourned.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.286
-You're still here.
-Yeah.

24:57.495 --> 24:59.998
You saw the fireworks.

25:00.081 --> 25:03.043
It was a bit unorthodox.

25:03.126 --> 25:05.545
But check this out.

25:05.629 --> 25:09.549
Two sweetest words in the English language,
"miss," "trial."

25:11.176 --> 25:14.137
-Not bad, huh?
-Not bad.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.934
Uh, is everything okay?

25:20.227 --> 25:22.520
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just...

25:25.315 --> 25:30.862
I have a case in Tucumcari.
And there's something I wanna discuss with you.

25:48.755 --> 25:52.425
LYLE: Fry pit looks good, Deshawn.
You can take off.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.469
Night, Tiffany. Good work.

25:55.595 --> 25:58.598
Good work. Juana, very good work.

25:59.933 --> 26:02.477
Crap, I forgot to cover the fryer.

26:02.560 --> 26:05.313
Uh, y-- Don't worry. I'll get it.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.482
-Thanks, man.
-Sure.

26:08.608 --> 26:10.527
See you tomorrow, Deshawn.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.878
Everything all right, Mr. Fring?

26:29.879 --> 26:31.548
This is acceptable to you?

26:35.802 --> 26:38.388
I thought Deshawn did a good job.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.141
Uh...

26:42.392 --> 26:44.686
I'm not seeing anything. It's...

26:46.021 --> 26:47.564
I understand.

26:49.691 --> 26:55.030
Uh, you know, like, now that I look closer...

26:56.031 --> 26:58.491
Yeah, I think I see maybe...

26:59.492 --> 27:04.414
Yeah. Okay. I'll take care of it, Mr. Fring.

27:05.540 --> 27:08.752
-All right.
-Yeah. I'm sorry about that. Sorry.

27:36.529 --> 27:38.323
Who puts a dead drop in a culvert?

27:39.407 --> 27:43.203
I mean, rain comes and, fssht,
your money's on its way to the Rio Grande.

27:43.286 --> 27:46.706
So you use a different drop
during the monsoon season.

27:47.749 --> 27:51.669
Culvert. That's a weird word.

27:52.796 --> 27:56.007
-What do you think that is, like, Dutch?
-Maybe French.

27:57.467 --> 28:01.262
-It's not French.
-In Spanish, it's <i>alcantarilla.</i>

28:01.346 --> 28:04.432
Well, it-- It doesn't come from Spanish.

28:05.433 --> 28:09.604
I mean, you ever hear anyone walk around
talking about the majestic culverts of Spain?

28:09.687 --> 28:13.441
Who the hell goes around
talking about majestic culverts?

28:13.525 --> 28:17.028
MAN : <i>Target is approaching.</i>
<i>Position 2, stand by.</i>

28:17.112 --> 28:19.739
Copy. Standing by.

28:23.410 --> 28:27.664
Well, only one drop left. That's us.

28:28.665 --> 28:33.044
-You think he'll do all three?
-Well, Molina's info has checked out so far.

28:34.337 --> 28:40.009
Long as we don't spook the target, I say
he rounds third and goes straight for home.

28:44.639 --> 28:46.057
You know how to use that thing?

28:47.058 --> 28:49.686
Point it at the bad guy. Press the button.

28:51.354 --> 28:54.983
Don't miss your shot, Ansel Adams.
We need this guy.

28:55.066 --> 28:58.862
MAN: <i>Position 2, we have the target.</i>
<i>Looks like he's headed inside.</i>

28:59.863 --> 29:01.281
Copy.

29:05.952 --> 29:07.454
Culvert.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.416
Culvert.

29:13.543 --> 29:17.046
Sounds like a Dutch word for crotch rot.

29:18.298 --> 29:21.551
MAN: <i>Target is on the move,</i>
<i>headed toward Position 3.</i>

29:23.553 --> 29:25.680
All right, guys, keep your distance.

29:27.140 --> 29:30.101
Hey, Byers and Vacca, roll back 30 yards.

29:30.185 --> 29:32.520
If I can see you, he can too.

29:33.646 --> 29:35.857
We don't want him to get nervous.

29:35.940 --> 29:39.152
Wanna keep him nice and relaxed.

29:40.403 --> 29:42.197
Like your mom on date night.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.532
Like your left hand every night.

29:53.708 --> 29:55.543
Is it okay, Mr. Fring?

29:57.045 --> 29:58.546
You can go home, Lyle.

30:00.882 --> 30:03.384
If it's not right, just let me try again.

30:03.468 --> 30:06.262
I can get this right for you, sir. Please.

30:10.934 --> 30:14.562
If you would like to take another crack at it,
then go ahead.

30:15.897 --> 30:17.357
Thank you.

30:41.881 --> 30:43.383
Here's our guy.

30:44.634 --> 30:48.096
-Cap off the lens there, Gomey.
-Screw you.

31:34.642 --> 31:36.811
Shit. He make us?

31:43.151 --> 31:45.153
Nah, I think we're good.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.730
Goddamn it.

32:20.813 --> 32:26.361
Hey, uh, yeah, our target's in flight.
All units, go west on Bobby Foster.

32:26.444 --> 32:27.570
We're in pursuit.

32:37.288 --> 32:39.248
-What are you doing?
-Getting ahead of him.

32:39.332 --> 32:42.293
-To where the puck's gonna be.
-But you don't know where he's going!

32:42.377 --> 32:43.544
I got a feeling.

33:31.342 --> 33:34.762
Federal agents! Come on out!

33:39.559 --> 33:41.436
Nice and slow!

33:42.562 --> 33:45.982
Hands! Show me your hands!

33:49.068 --> 33:50.528
Damn it.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.441
GOMEZ:
Schrader!

34:49.754 --> 34:53.925
Well, what do you say, Gomey?
Let's spelunk.

35:24.664 --> 35:27.542
All right. I lost them.

35:35.591 --> 35:38.970
GOMEZ:
<i>Six ninety-six, 698,</i>

35:39.053 --> 35:43.850
700,000 dollars and some change.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.643
Damn.

35:45.726 --> 35:48.729
We sure took a bite out of crime tonight,
McGruff.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.982
Mm. Booby prize.

35:51.065 --> 35:55.236
Come on, man. We got the money.
We got the douchebags who did the drop.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.488
We got three assholes in cuffs.

35:57.572 --> 36:01.868
And we put Molina back out on the street.
Who knows what else he's gonna scare up?

36:02.952 --> 36:06.664
Yeah, I wanted to go upstream, Gomey,
not downstream.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.215
Here goes.

36:16.299 --> 36:19.844
Alrighty. Everybody, circle up! Circle up!

36:21.095 --> 36:22.972
Come on, bring it in!

36:24.348 --> 36:27.935
I just wanna thank you all
for a successful operation.

36:28.019 --> 36:32.440
Great work across the board.
APD, hey, you guys are first-rate.

36:32.523 --> 36:36.319
We're putting bracelets
on three shitbirds as we speak.

36:36.402 --> 36:42.033
And better yet, we got ourselves a buttload
of money. All right? Just shy of a million dollars.

36:42.116 --> 36:45.494
So some major dickwad
of a dealer's hurting tonight.

36:45.578 --> 36:47.663
And that's because of all of you.

36:47.747 --> 36:54.045
So to show my appreciation, we're all going
to O'Neill's, and first round's on me.

36:54.128 --> 36:56.380
ALL: Yeah!
HANK: Yeah! All right!

36:56.464 --> 36:57.423
Thank y'all!

37:07.350 --> 37:09.936
VICTOR: <i>All clear.</i>
-And the money?

37:10.019 --> 37:12.813
<i>They got it. Went down like it was supposed to.</i>

37:26.953 --> 37:33.209
-Mr. Fring, I was just about to come find you.
-Thank you, Lyle. You can go home.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.422
Um, but is it, like...?

37:39.465 --> 37:43.386
-You think it's okay? It's clean?
-It is acceptable.

37:52.812 --> 37:54.855
Have a good night, Mr. Fring.

38:43.863 --> 38:44.780
Who the hell are you?

38:44.864 --> 38:47.700
Mr. Acker, my name is Saul Goodman.
I'm an attorney.

38:47.783 --> 38:51.829
I've had it up to here
with you Mesa Verde scumbags. Get bent.

38:51.912 --> 38:55.249
I'm not representing Mesa Verde.
In fact, I'd like to represent you, sir.

38:55.333 --> 39:00.004
I don't need a lawyer. I don't want a lawyer.
Nothing you can say is gonna change my mind.

39:00.087 --> 39:03.007
-Now, move your damn foot.
-Sir, if you would just--

39:03.090 --> 39:07.303
Please, just take a look at my proposal, okay?
Because I think you'll find it persuasive.

39:07.386 --> 39:09.347
-I don't want it.
-Just look at it, sir.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.557
Just look. What do you see?

39:17.146 --> 39:18.981
A man...

39:23.611 --> 39:25.863
fucking a horse.

39:26.864 --> 39:32.620
Sir, I hate Mesa Verde. I hate them.
Looking down at us from their glass tower.

39:32.703 --> 39:37.249
They think they can shit on whoever they want,
and we have to smile and say, "Thank you"?

39:37.333 --> 39:41.545
Look, picture me as the man
and Mesa Verde as the horse.

39:41.629 --> 39:45.132
I'm the guy who'll do whatever it takes
to stick it to them.

39:48.552 --> 39:51.680
-Guess who's got a new client in Tucumcari.
KIM: <i>What?</i>

39:51.764 --> 39:53.432
That's right. Put some beers on ice.

39:53.516 --> 39:56.060
We'll celebrate when I get back
from the hinterlands.

39:56.143 --> 40:01.107
<i>Yes. That's the best news I've heard all day.</i>
<i>How the hell did you convince him?</i>

40:01.190 --> 40:02.358
Uh...

40:02.441 --> 40:08.114
Uh, visual aids. You'd be surprised what you
can find on that Internet. So Chinese tonight?

40:08.197 --> 40:10.282
<i>-Yeah, sounds good. I'll see you later.</i>
-Bye.

43:04.039 --> 43:07.251
MAN 1: What'd y'all get into last night?
MAN 2: Absolutely nothing, G.

43:07.334 --> 43:09.670
-Yo, G, pass that lighter.
MAN 1: Hey, yo, your girl came by.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.130
You need to keep her in check, fam.

43:11.213 --> 43:13.716
MAN 3: She tripping.
MAN 4: I've been telling you about that, man.

43:13.799 --> 43:15.551
-Black her eyes.
MAN 1: Yo, yo. Ain't that...?

43:15.634 --> 43:17.177
Yo, that's...

43:40.576 --> 43:41.910
Yo, Gramps!

43:54.965 --> 43:56.634
First one's free, dickhead!
