WEBVTT

00:02.068 --> 00:03.330
Professional tennis...

00:04.671 --> 00:07.333
I don't understand the shushing.
Why are they always shushing?

00:07.507 --> 00:10.135
Don't the players know
that we're there?

00:11.011 --> 00:14.845
Should we duck behind the seats
so they don't see us watching them?

00:15.015 --> 00:17.040
To me, tennis is basically
just Ping-Pong...

00:17.217 --> 00:20.015
...and the players
are standing on the table.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.120
That's all it is.

00:22.288 --> 00:23.755
And that goofy scoring.

00:23.923 --> 00:27.051
You win one point, all of a sudden
you're up by 15.

00:28.094 --> 00:32.030
Two points, 30-love. 30-love.

00:32.198 --> 00:35.190
Sounds like an English call girl.
"That'll be 30, love.

00:36.269 --> 00:39.761
And could you be a little quieter
next time, please?"

00:46.179 --> 00:49.046
Are these seats unbelievable,
or what?

00:49.215 --> 00:52.378
-Hey, where's the sunblock?
-Here.

00:53.153 --> 00:55.485
Twenty-five? You don't have
anything higher?

00:55.655 --> 00:59.648
-What, are you on Mercury?
-I need higher.

00:59.826 --> 01:02.488
This has PABA in it.
I need PABA-free.

01:03.363 --> 01:06.264
-You got a problem with PABA?
-I have a problem with PABA.

01:06.433 --> 01:10.096
-You don't even know what PABA is.
-I know enough to stay away from it.

01:13.139 --> 01:14.163
<i>Thirty-love.</i>

01:14.340 --> 01:17.901
-So you going to Todd's party?
-If somebody else drives. You going?

01:18.078 --> 01:21.013
-Gwen really wants to go.
-You're bringing a date to a party?

01:21.347 --> 01:22.609
No good?

01:22.782 --> 01:25.842
A party's a bad date situation.
It doesn't matter who you're with.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.646
You could be with J. Edgar Hoover.

01:27.821 --> 01:31.518
You don't wanna sit and talk with
Hoover all night. You want to circulate.

01:33.293 --> 01:36.057
Why'd you pick Hoover?
Is he that interesting to talk to?

01:36.229 --> 01:39.062
Well, with the law enforcement
and the cross-dressing...

01:39.232 --> 01:41.359
...seems like an interesting guy.

01:41.534 --> 01:42.796
Yeah, I guess.

01:42.969 --> 01:44.960
What can I do?
I gotta take her with me.

01:45.138 --> 01:47.470
Todd introduced us. I'm obligated.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.473
That woman is absolutely stunning.

01:50.810 --> 01:53.779
-Who, the Croat?
-No, not the Croat. The lineswoman.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.780
That is the most beautiful lineswoman
I've ever seen.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.850
Yeah, she's a BL.

01:59.018 --> 02:02.784
-BL?
-Beautiful lineswoman.

02:04.524 --> 02:07.493
I'm gonna go to the concession stand
to get some real sunblock.

02:07.660 --> 02:10.127
You want anything? Jerry?

02:10.697 --> 02:11.994
Jerry?

02:14.634 --> 02:17.762
You know, I just heard
the Lexington line is out.

02:17.937 --> 02:20.804
You are kidding me. How am I
supposed to get to this meeting?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.839
Take a car service.
We have an account.

02:23.009 --> 02:24.840
No, forget it. I hate those.

02:25.011 --> 02:28.469
Every time I've taken one,
the driver will not stop talking to me.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.947
No matter how disinterested I seem,
he just keeps yakking away.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.854
Why does everything have
to have a social component?

02:37.023 --> 02:40.254
See, the stagecoach. Now, that
would've been a good situation for me.

02:40.426 --> 02:43.156
I'm in the coach, and the driver's
way up there on the stage.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.856
You're not gonna get a cab now,
4:30 on a Friday afternoon.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.864
Bring a magazine.
Keep your head down.

02:49.035 --> 02:50.525
Yeah, I guess that could work.

Match to Ms. Natalia Baudone.</i>

03:11.724 --> 03:13.783
<i>Coming up next, men's singles.</i>

03:13.960 --> 03:18.226
<i>But for now, let's stop and look at
our beautiful tennis-center backdrop.</i>

03:18.631 --> 03:20.292
Hey!

03:20.800 --> 03:22.233
There's George.

03:22.402 --> 03:25.235
<i>Holy cow. It's a scorcher.</i>

03:26.673 --> 03:29.005
<i>Boy, I bet you that guy
could cover a lot of court.</i>

03:29.175 --> 03:32.975
<i>Hey, buddy, they got a new
invention. It's called a napkin.</i>

03:33.146 --> 03:36.445
<i>Well, we'll take a station break
and continue with more action.</i>

03:38.785 --> 03:41.618
Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, huh?

03:43.556 --> 03:47.014
Pendant Publishing,
that's books, right?

03:47.560 --> 03:49.187
Miss?

03:49.362 --> 03:51.728
-Pardon me?
-Books. That's what you do?

03:51.898 --> 03:53.593
Yeah.

03:54.300 --> 03:58.532
Yeah, I don't read much myself.
Well, you know, besides the paper.

03:58.705 --> 04:01.674
Yeah, a lot of people read to relax.
Not me.

04:01.841 --> 04:03.638
You know what I do?

04:03.810 --> 04:08.406
You know, I'm having a lot of trouble
hearing you back here, so...

04:08.581 --> 04:11.641
I said, you know what I do
when I want to relax?

04:12.585 --> 04:13.916
The jumble.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.148
Hey, do you make a book
of jumbles?

04:17.322 --> 04:20.815
I'm gonna have to be
honest with you.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.962
I'm going deaf.

04:23.129 --> 04:25.256
-Going deaf?
-What?

04:26.199 --> 04:28.429
Oh, I... I'm sorry.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.695
It can be very frustrating.

04:31.871 --> 04:34.362
Hey, what about a hearing aid?

04:34.540 --> 04:38.670
Am I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah, sure.
Who isn't?

04:38.845 --> 04:41.177
But, you know,
you gotta live your life.

04:41.347 --> 04:44.145
No, no, no. I said...

04:44.317 --> 04:45.682
Forget it.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.260
I can't take my eyes
off this lineswoman.

04:56.429 --> 04:58.454
The woman is absolutely
mesmerizing.

04:58.631 --> 05:01.998
-Boy, you are really smitten.
-I gotta talk to her.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.931
-What do you think?
-Cold?

05:04.103 --> 05:06.571
How you gonna do that?
You're not one of those guys.

05:06.739 --> 05:11.073
I'll psych myself into it like those
people that walk across the hot coals.

05:11.244 --> 05:14.907
But they're not mocked and humiliated
when they get to the other side.

05:15.081 --> 05:17.140
I have to. I won't be able
to live with myself.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.285
Wait. Jerry, there's
a bigger issue here.

05:19.452 --> 05:22.046
If you go through that wall
and become one of those guys...

05:22.221 --> 05:24.416
...I'll be left here on this side.

05:25.224 --> 05:28.057
-Take me with you.
-I can't.

05:29.929 --> 05:32.022
What are you gonna say?

05:32.198 --> 05:34.666
I don't know. "Hi."

05:35.501 --> 05:39.164
You think you're going
to the other side with "hi"?

05:39.339 --> 05:41.330
You're not gonna make it.

05:43.476 --> 05:47.310
<i>-Base to 92, come in.
-Yeah, this is 92.</i>

05:47.480 --> 05:50.347
<i>Yeah, after this, go back
to the city for a 6:00 pickup.</i>

05:50.516 --> 05:51.608
Rightio.

05:51.784 --> 05:54.844
<i>749 Bleeker.
The party's Hanks. Tom Hanks.</i>

05:55.288 --> 05:56.687
Tom Hanks?

05:56.856 --> 06:00.690
After me, you're picking up
Tom Hanks? I love him.

06:01.227 --> 06:04.890
So I guess your hearing
goes in and out, huh?

06:05.832 --> 06:08.767
-Yeah. Yes, it...
-Yeah, you know what I think?

06:08.935 --> 06:10.903
I think you made
that whole thing up.

06:11.070 --> 06:14.198
-No, no. I...
-Yeah, yeah. I know your type.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.366
You're too good to make conversation
with someone like me.

06:17.543 --> 06:21.001
Oh, God forbid you
could discuss the jumbles.

06:21.447 --> 06:24.007
But to go so far as to pretend
you're almost deaf?

06:24.183 --> 06:27.050
I mean, that is
truly disgusting, miss.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.710
And Mr. Tom Hanks...

06:29.021 --> 06:33.515
May I say he, too, would be
disgusted by your behavior.

06:36.696 --> 06:38.664
Excuse me.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.395
Excuse me.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.057
Oh, that's nice.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.296
That's right, ignore me.
That's real polite.

06:46.472 --> 06:49.908
Yeah, nobody's even talking to you.
Oh, you're a big lineswoman.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.739
Oh, like that's some kind
of a cool job. I know your type.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.643
Think you're too good for everyone.
But it's women like you...

06:56.816 --> 06:59.341
Oh, well... What, are you deaf?

06:59.952 --> 07:02.250
Bingo.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.994
-And you're saying she's deaf?
-I'm not saying she's deaf. She's deaf.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.097
-Can't hear a thing.
-Can't hear a thing.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.665
-You're gonna go out with her?
-Isn't that something?

07:14.834 --> 07:15.926
-Hey.
-Hi.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.195
-Yeah, you know, I know how to sign.
-Really?

07:18.371 --> 07:21.636
When I was 8, I had a deaf cousin
who lived with us for about a year.

07:21.808 --> 07:26.006
Of course, you know, I haven't
been able to do it in a while.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.203
What is this about?

07:27.580 --> 07:29.844
I met this deaf lineswoman
at the tennis match.

07:30.016 --> 07:33.281
You are kidding. That is amazing.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.515
I just took a car service from work.

07:35.688 --> 07:38.782
To get the driver not to talk to me,
I pretended I was going deaf.

07:39.192 --> 07:42.161
-Good plan.
-It didn't work. He caught me hearing.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.829
All right. It's terrible,
but I'm not terrible.

07:45.998 --> 07:47.192
-No.
-No.

07:47.366 --> 07:51.063
No. When I shoo squirrels away,
I always say, "Get out of here."

07:51.237 --> 07:54.263
I never, ever throw things at them
and try to injure them...

07:54.440 --> 07:56.135
...like other people.
-That's nice.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.540
Yeah. And when I see freaks in the
street, I never, ever stare at them.

07:59.712 --> 08:01.373
And yet I'm careful
not to look away.

08:01.547 --> 08:05.142
See, because I wanna make
the freaks feel comfortable.

08:06.686 --> 08:08.449
-That's nice for the freaks.
-Yeah.

08:08.621 --> 08:10.680
I don't pouf my hair when I go
to the movies...

08:10.857 --> 08:12.222
...so people behind me can see.

08:12.391 --> 08:15.724
I gotta make it up to this guy.
I won't be able to live with myself.

08:15.895 --> 08:18.363
-What can I do?
-Why don't you get him some tickets.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.829
-Your friend works at a ticket agency.
-Yeah. Pete.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.991
-He can get you tickets to something.
-Really?

08:23.169 --> 08:24.898
Like a rock concert.
Whatever you like.

08:25.071 --> 08:28.268
-Oh, great. Thanks, Kramer.
-Yeah. You got it.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.535
Hey, Jerry, do me a favor.
Next time you see that lineswoman...

08:31.711 --> 08:34.179
...ask her how those ball boys
get those jobs.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.076
I would love to be able to do that.

08:36.249 --> 08:40.015
I think perhaps you've overlooked
one of the key aspects of this activity.

08:40.186 --> 08:45.590
It's ball boys, not ball men.
There are no ball men.

08:46.726 --> 08:48.921
I think he's right.
I've never seen a ball man.

08:49.095 --> 08:52.531
-Well, there ought to be ball men.
-All right, I'll talk to her.

08:52.698 --> 08:57.101
You wanna be a ball man, go ahead.
Break the ball barrier. Hey!

08:57.770 --> 09:01.604
A friend of mine from work said
she saw George at the tennis match...

09:01.774 --> 09:04.265
...on TV yesterday.
-Yeah. Yeah, me too.

09:04.443 --> 09:07.378
He was at the snack bar
eating a hot fudge sundae.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.947
He had it all over his face.

09:10.116 --> 09:12.482
He's wearing that chocolate
on his face like a beard.

09:12.652 --> 09:15.917
And they got in there
really nice and tight, and he's:

09:19.992 --> 09:22.085
-I'm sorry, George.
-But...

09:22.795 --> 09:26.128
...I don't understand.
Things were going so great.

09:26.599 --> 09:28.624
What happened?
Something must've happened.

09:29.135 --> 09:31.262
It's not you. It's me.

09:32.171 --> 09:36.301
You're giving me
the "it's not you, it's me" routine?

09:36.475 --> 09:41.174
I invented "it's not you, it's me."
Nobody tells me it's them, not me.

09:41.347 --> 09:44.009
-If it's anybody, it's me.
-All right.

09:44.183 --> 09:47.778
-George, it's you.
-You are damn right it's me.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.748
-I was just trying to...
-I know what you were trying to do.

09:50.923 --> 09:54.256
-Nobody does it better than me.
-I'm sure you do it very well.

09:54.427 --> 09:59.091
Yes, well, unfortunately, you'll never
get the chance to find out.

10:02.001 --> 10:05.869
-But I thought things were going great.
-Yeah, so did I.

10:06.305 --> 10:08.136
-Did she say why?
-No.

10:08.941 --> 10:12.536
She tried to give me
the "it's not you, it's me" routine.

10:13.012 --> 10:16.072
-But that's your routine.
-Yeah.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.877
Well, apparently word's out.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.484
Hey. Hey, Georgie,
I saw you on TV yesterday.

10:25.891 --> 10:27.222
Really? At the tennis match?

10:27.393 --> 10:30.055
Yeah. You were at the snack bar
eating the hot fudge sundae.

10:30.229 --> 10:32.720
Get out of here.
I didn't see any cameras there.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.366
Oh, the camera was... there.

10:35.534 --> 10:38.697
And the announcers, they made
a couple of cracks about you.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.467
Cracks?

10:42.808 --> 10:44.503
What were they saying?

10:44.677 --> 10:46.577
That you had ice cream
all over your face.

10:46.746 --> 10:48.976
They were talking about
how funny you looked.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.879
Oh, my God. Maybe Gwen saw it.
Maybe that's what did it.

10:53.052 --> 10:55.452
Well, I'll tell you,
it wasn't a pretty sight.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.548
She must've seen me
eating it on TV.

10:59.725 --> 11:02.057
She sees you with hot fudge
on your face and ends it?

11:02.228 --> 11:06.358
-You think she'd be that superficial?
-Why not? I would be.

11:09.735 --> 11:12.329
Hello? Oh, hi, Dad.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.132
You saw him?

11:14.607 --> 11:18.509
Really, with the ice cream?
All right, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.236
-Your parents saw me on TV?
-Yeah.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.608
This is a nightmare.
Kramer, how long was I on?

11:22.782 --> 11:24.716
It felt like eight seconds.

11:24.884 --> 11:27.648
One-1000. Two-1000.
Three-1000...

11:27.820 --> 11:31.688
I heard you really inhaled that thing.
Did anyone tape it?

11:32.792 --> 11:34.350
Can we move on?

11:35.161 --> 11:37.026
-What?
-He thinks Gwen broke up with him...

11:37.196 --> 11:39.721
...because she saw him
eating the ice cream on TV.

11:39.899 --> 11:42.527
Come on. If she's that superficial,
you don't want her.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.863
Yes, I do.

11:47.606 --> 11:49.870
I guess you're not going
to Todd's party on Friday.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.942
Well, I can't now.
Gwen's gonna be there.

11:52.111 --> 11:53.976
She should be the one
that shouldn't go.

11:54.146 --> 11:57.604
If a couple breaks up with plans to go
to a neutral place, who withdraws?

11:57.783 --> 12:00.183
-What's the etiquette?
-Excellent question.

12:00.352 --> 12:02.013
I mean, I think she should withdraw.

12:02.188 --> 12:06.522
She's the breaker. He's the breakee.
He needs to get on with his life.

12:06.692 --> 12:08.125
-I beg to differ.
-Really?

12:08.494 --> 12:10.325
He's the loser.

12:14.033 --> 12:19.494
She's the victor. To the victor
belong the spoils.

12:19.672 --> 12:22.072
Well, I don't care.
I don't want to go anyway.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.232
I don't wanna fight that traffic
on Friday.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.037
We can take my office's car service.

12:26.212 --> 12:27.907
-Really?
-Yeah. They don't know.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.741
-All right. I'll see you later.
-Okay.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.645
-Hey, Georgie, you coming?
-Yeah.

12:33.018 --> 12:35.953
"To the victor go the spoils."

12:38.824 --> 12:40.086
What are you doing tonight?

12:40.259 --> 12:43.592
I got a date with Laura,
the lineswoman.

12:44.463 --> 12:46.294
Why?

12:48.434 --> 12:52.632
-What are you doing?
-I was just gonna wander the streets.

12:52.805 --> 12:56.332
I don't want to tag along with you
or anything.

12:58.811 --> 13:00.608
You wanted to come with us?

13:01.380 --> 13:03.211
Jerry, please.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.407
It's very nice, but...

13:05.584 --> 13:07.711
Where would we be going?

13:10.389 --> 13:15.952
So I've got ice cream all over my face.
There were no napkins there.

13:16.128 --> 13:19.154
Whoever is responsible for stocking
that concession stand...

13:19.331 --> 13:20.855
...cost me a relationship.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.194
-They never have napkins there.
-Let's get the check.

13:26.338 --> 13:30.297
Is this considered signing? Do you
do this when you ask for the check?

13:30.476 --> 13:33.809
Really? I know a sign.
That's my first sign.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.684
That couple is breaking up.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.050
They're breaking up?

13:43.222 --> 13:45.486
-How do you know?
-She reads lips.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.388
What are they saying now?

13:49.595 --> 13:52.758
"It's not you. It's me."

13:58.671 --> 14:00.263
Oh, my God.

14:00.439 --> 14:02.771
I just had a great idea.

14:03.209 --> 14:07.202
She could come to the party tomorrow
and read Gwen's lips for me.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.679
What?

14:11.550 --> 14:13.677
We bring her to the party...

14:13.886 --> 14:17.322
...and she tells me what Gwen
is saying about me.

14:18.891 --> 14:20.825
She's not a novelty act, George...

14:20.993 --> 14:24.588
...that you hire out for weddings
and bar mitzvahs.

14:24.763 --> 14:28.426
Look, it's a skill, just like juggling.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.434
She probably enjoys showing it off.

14:33.105 --> 14:37.599
I don't know, George.
I'm not sure about this.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.171
Would you ask her? Just ask her.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.846
-If she says no, case closed.
-All right.

14:48.821 --> 14:53.554
-Laura, George was wondering if...
-Sure. I'll do it.

14:56.528 --> 14:59.224
-So I really had a good time.
-Yeah, me too.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.923
-Wanna go to the party on Friday?
-Yeah.

15:02.101 --> 15:04.160
All right, we're taking a car service.

15:04.336 --> 15:06.361
So we'll swing by and pick you up.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.566
How about 6?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.733
Six is good.

15:12.811 --> 15:15.302
You got a problem with 6?

15:17.316 --> 15:19.978
What? What?

15:26.091 --> 15:28.025
Okay, listen up, people.

15:28.193 --> 15:31.424
There are plenty of you here,
but we've only got two spots to fill.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.087
So good luck.

15:33.265 --> 15:37.361
Hey, pops, isn't there a better way
to spend your twilight years?

15:38.003 --> 15:40.995
Well, I may be old, but I'm spry.

15:42.241 --> 15:46.041
The tryout lasts three and a half
to four hours.

15:46.211 --> 15:49.044
-Are you up for it?
-Oh, I'll be up for it, punk.

16:05.664 --> 16:09.293
See, I was saying "six,"
but she thought I was saying "sex."

16:09.468 --> 16:11.197
We straightened
the whole thing out.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.463
-She confused "six" with "sex"?
-Yeah.

16:13.872 --> 16:17.308
If she can't tell "six" from "sex," how's
she gonna lip read across a room?

16:17.476 --> 16:21.207
-"Six" and "sex" are close.
-It's two completely different sounds:

16:21.380 --> 16:22.870
And:

16:24.717 --> 16:26.014
It seems like a problem.

16:26.185 --> 16:29.245
Well, I'm not dating
any other deaf women.

16:29.855 --> 16:32.756
Hey, guess who's gonna be
the new ball man for the finals?

16:32.925 --> 16:34.085
-You're kidding.
-Yeah.

16:34.259 --> 16:37.160
They said they never saw anybody
go after balls with such gusto.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.957
-When is that car service coming?
-Five minutes.

16:40.132 --> 16:43.226
It's gonna pick us up, then Elaine.
Laura's gonna meet us there.

16:43.402 --> 16:46.838
If this lip-reading thing works tonight,
you know how incredible it'll be?

16:47.006 --> 16:50.237
-It's like having Superman for a friend.
-I know. It's like x-ray vision.

16:50.409 --> 16:54.436
If we could just harness this power
and use it for our own personal gain...

16:54.613 --> 16:56.877
...there'd be no stopping us.
-Hey, hey, hey.

16:57.049 --> 17:00.576
I hear you got some lip reader
working for you. Let me use her once.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.311
-Can't do it, Newman.
-But, Jerry...

17:02.488 --> 17:04.615
...we got this new supervisor
at the post office.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.190
He's working behind glass.
They're talking about me.

17:07.358 --> 17:10.726
They're gonna transfer me. I know it!
Two hours. Give me two hours.

17:10.896 --> 17:12.954
It's not gonna happen!

17:13.464 --> 17:16.901
All right. All right.
All right, you go ahead.

17:17.069 --> 17:20.060
You go ahead. You keep it secret.
But you remember this:

17:20.239 --> 17:25.871
When you control the mail,
you control information.

17:28.446 --> 17:30.472
Just pull over right by
that stop sign.

17:30.649 --> 17:33.311
-Pardon me, sir?
-I said, pull over by the stop sign.

17:33.485 --> 17:38.081
Oh, sorry. You'll have to forgive me.
I can't hear a damn thing.

17:38.257 --> 17:40.623
Went to a rock concert
last night at the Garden.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.220
My seats were right up
against the speaker.

17:44.396 --> 17:47.456
It's a heavy metal group,
Metalli-something.

17:47.633 --> 17:48.622
Ca.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.462
-What?
-Ca.

17:50.636 --> 17:53.070
My ears are still ringing.

17:53.705 --> 17:56.902
Some woman's idea of a joke.

17:58.944 --> 18:01.139
-Hey.
-Hi.

18:03.215 --> 18:05.080
-Get out. Get out!
-We'll never get there.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.239
-Go on!
-Okay.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.216
Hey! Shut the door.

18:14.426 --> 18:19.261
The whole idea of the car service
was so I wouldn't have to fight traffic.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.726
I know, I'm late. Hey,
now I know two signs.

18:23.902 --> 18:25.870
"Check" and "late."

18:26.038 --> 18:29.064
Hey, this is my friend you helped
become the first ball man.

18:29.241 --> 18:30.538
Congratulations.

18:39.318 --> 18:42.310
She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.954
Guys, you made it.

18:46.692 --> 18:47.920
-Hey.
-Hey, buddy.

18:48.093 --> 18:51.119
-Hey, Todd.
-Sorry to hear about Gwen.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.163
Why, did she say something
about why she broke up with me?

18:54.333 --> 18:57.063
No. Tonight will be the first chance
I've had to talk to her.

18:57.402 --> 18:58.733
Really?

18:58.904 --> 19:00.963
Look, George,
I'm friends with both of you...

19:01.140 --> 19:05.543
...but I can't betray her confidence
by telling you anything.

19:05.711 --> 19:10.114
I wouldn't hear of it, Todd.
It's none of my business.

19:10.282 --> 19:13.376
But you should try and find out
everything you possibly can.

19:13.552 --> 19:17.352
In fact, I'll even stay all the way
over on the other side of the room...

19:17.523 --> 19:21.152
...just so there's no chance
of me overhearing anything.

19:21.326 --> 19:24.489
-You are so centered.
-Hey.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.494
I've grown up.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.793
Oh, my God. There she is.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

19:30.636 --> 19:33.400
-Let's go, let's go. Get in position.
-What?

19:34.740 --> 19:37.868
All right, all right.
What are they saying?

19:38.944 --> 19:41.071
-"Hi, Gwen." "Hi, Tide."
-High tide?

19:41.246 --> 19:43.373
"Hi, Todd."

19:43.582 --> 19:45.413
"You got something
between your teeth."

19:45.584 --> 19:48.519
-Where?
-No, that's what he said.

19:49.454 --> 19:53.083
"That's interesting. I love carrots,
but I hate carrot soup.

19:53.592 --> 19:56.618
And I hate peas,
but I love pea soup."

19:56.795 --> 19:59.355
-So do I.
-This is so wild.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.362
Can I borrow her
for a few hours tomorrow?

20:01.533 --> 20:03.398
No. Then I'd have to lend her
to everybody.

20:03.902 --> 20:06.336
I don't envy you, Todd.
This place is gonna be a mess.

20:06.505 --> 20:10.202
Maybe you can stick around,
and we can sweep together.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.776
"Why don't you stick around,
and we can sleep together."

20:13.946 --> 20:16.141
-What?
-"You want me to sleep with you?"

20:16.315 --> 20:19.284
-I don't wanna sweep alone.
-He says, "I don't wanna sleep alone."

20:19.451 --> 20:22.784
And she says... Oh, boy.
"Love to."

20:22.955 --> 20:24.786
All right, that's it.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.888
You get rid of me, now the two
of you are gonna sleep together?

20:28.060 --> 20:31.393
-What? You're crazy.
-"What? You're crazy."

20:31.563 --> 20:34.555
-I heard your whole conversation.
-How?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.994
-"How?"
-I can read lips.

20:38.170 --> 20:41.970
-You said, "Let's sleep together."
-No, I didn't. I said "sweep."

20:42.140 --> 20:44.438
Let's sweep together,
like with a broom.

20:44.610 --> 20:45.804
-Cleaning up.
-"Cleaning up."

20:45.978 --> 20:47.206
Sweep?

20:47.379 --> 20:48.971
-Yes. Sweep.
-"Yes. Sweep."

20:49.147 --> 20:50.637
-Cut it.
-George says, "Cut it."

20:50.816 --> 20:51.840
-Cut it.
-George says...

20:52.017 --> 20:54.645
Cut it. Would you stop signing?!

20:54.820 --> 20:57.015
-What?
-They said "sweep together," idiots.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.157
Not "sleep together."

21:00.926 --> 21:02.917
Look, I know how to sign.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.427
My eye! My eye!

21:06.865 --> 21:10.426
This is really amazing, getting to see
Monica Seles play in the finals.

21:10.602 --> 21:13.469
I know. And in the first tournament
of her comeback.

21:31.490 --> 21:35.290
Thus ends the great
ball man experiment.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.972
-You with the tennis center?
-Yeah.

21:48.540 --> 21:51.304
Hey, how about that ball man
injuring Monica Seles?

21:51.476 --> 21:54.639
-Wasn't that something?
-I'm deaf.

22:06.458 --> 22:10.792
I've always been a big fan
of the little check move, you know?

22:11.663 --> 22:14.461
"Can I get the check? The check."

22:14.633 --> 22:17.466
Unless the waiter's not too sharp.
Then you gotta total it up.

22:17.636 --> 22:18.898
<i>"I want the check."</i>

22:19.871 --> 22:21.600
They come over,
"Do you want the check?"

22:21.773 --> 22:24.708
"No, I want to be pen pals.
Can't you see what I'm doing here?

22:24.876 --> 22:28.243
I'm trying to be cool
and impress people."
