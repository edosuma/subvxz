00:07.140 --> 00:08.391
[knocking on door]

00:10.561 --> 00:12.020
[knocking continues]

00:15.190 --> 00:17.109
- [Mickey] Hi. [chuckles]
- [Gus] Hello.

00:21.947 --> 00:23.115
How's it goin'?

00:23.198 --> 00:24.367
- Good.
- Good.

00:24.450 --> 00:27.160
I was thinking
we should order some food.

00:27.244 --> 00:28.871
Yeah, sure. Okay.

00:28.954 --> 00:31.415
Yeah. I'm not hungry now,
but I figured I will be soon.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.667
Right. Right, right, right.
Oh, yeah, let's, um...

00:33.751 --> 00:36.754
Yeah. Hope it's not too lame
to just hang out here.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.964
- No, no. It'll be fun.
- Okay, cool.

00:39.047 --> 00:40.758
- Okay. Cool, all right.
- Let's order.

00:51.143 --> 00:52.269
[chuckles]

00:53.979 --> 00:56.023
- You wanna order pizza?
- No.

00:56.106 --> 00:57.691
I have menus.

00:59.234 --> 01:00.569
[Mickey] These are pretty good.

01:01.278 --> 01:03.947
I think Silverlake Ramen's
in here somewhere.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.616
- Good.
- Ooh.

01:06.992 --> 01:08.994
[Mickey tutting]

01:10.871 --> 01:12.665
Ye old drug box.

01:12.748 --> 01:15.501
Oh. Okay.

01:15.584 --> 01:18.170
- Should we see what's in here?
- Sure.

01:18.253 --> 01:20.464
Yeah, let's check it out.
I'm curious.

01:20.548 --> 01:23.509
- [sighing] Have a look-see.
- Let's see what we got here.

01:23.592 --> 01:27.012
- Ooh. Edible...
- Okay.

01:27.095 --> 01:28.639
Um...

01:28.722 --> 01:30.307
- Ecstasy.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:30.390 --> 01:32.560
Got some cocaine.

01:32.643 --> 01:34.478
Got a real party in there.

01:34.562 --> 01:35.771
Why, you want it?

01:37.189 --> 01:38.190
Are you serious, or...

01:38.273 --> 01:41.234
I mean, not for us to do together,
'cause I have no use for this, but...

01:41.318 --> 01:42.945
Right. Yeah, uh...

01:43.028 --> 01:45.489
No, I'm... I'm good.
Thank you.

01:45.573 --> 01:48.409
Was that bad for me to say?
You can tell me if it was.

01:48.492 --> 01:50.828
No, no, I was just more surprised
that you...

01:51.829 --> 01:53.789
Never mind.
[stammers] I don't know what's, like,

01:53.872 --> 01:56.208
private about your sobriety
and stuff so I'll just...

01:56.291 --> 01:57.793
[inhales sharply]
keep out of it.

01:57.876 --> 02:00.421
No, I... I brought it up. So...

02:01.338 --> 02:03.256
It's fair game. Ask away.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.800
No, I just...

02:04.883 --> 02:07.678
I figured if you had it around,

02:07.761 --> 02:10.263
you'd be tempted to do it or something.

02:10.347 --> 02:11.599
I... I don't know.

02:11.682 --> 02:15.143
Yeah, I mean,
I should throw this shit out.

02:15.227 --> 02:18.313
That's what they'd tell me in AA.
It's definitely...

02:18.396 --> 02:20.232
dumb of me to keep it around.

02:20.315 --> 02:21.609
Mmm-hmm.

02:23.110 --> 02:25.403
So, do you think you would, or...

02:25.488 --> 02:27.364
not, or...

02:27.448 --> 02:29.867
Uh, it's just...

02:29.950 --> 02:33.662
I think somebody would pay me money
for all this stuff.

02:33.746 --> 02:34.747
[Gus chuckles]

02:40.210 --> 02:41.879
Whatever. Fine. Fuck it.

02:45.257 --> 02:46.299
[clattering]

02:47.760 --> 02:48.802
Hmm.

02:50.178 --> 02:51.514
All right, there's more.

02:51.597 --> 02:53.557
There's more, okay. All right.

02:54.892 --> 02:56.894
Just gonna throw out all the fun ones.

02:57.770 --> 03:00.689
Got this beauty
from a guy in Venice.

03:00.773 --> 03:03.358
- He makes them with his wife and kids.
- Aw...

03:05.443 --> 03:08.614
There's something really charming about,
like, a family business, you know?

03:08.697 --> 03:11.700
There should be a Ziploc bag
full of mushrooms in the freezer.

03:11.784 --> 03:13.451
- [objects clattering]
- Oh. Okay.

03:13.536 --> 03:15.037
- Did you find it?
- Yeah.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.360
- [inhales through teeth]
- Ooh.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.999
These are some special mushrooms.

03:19.082 --> 03:22.252
I had one of the best days of my life
tripping on these bad boys at Legoland.

03:22.335 --> 03:25.130
One of my best days was at Legoland
and I wasn't even high.

03:26.632 --> 03:30.302
Feels like such a shame to throw 'em out.
Are you sure you don't want 'em?

03:30.385 --> 03:32.429
Nah. I'm not really a shrooms guy.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.766
- Have you ever done shrooms?
- No.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.977
- I know that's lame, but...
- It's not lame.

03:39.061 --> 03:40.979
- I don't care.
- I mean, I almost did them.

03:41.063 --> 03:43.440
My buddies and I were gonna do 'em
on a camping trip,

03:43.524 --> 03:44.900
but then we got rained out...

03:44.983 --> 03:48.153
But I feel like since I'd made
the choice to do them...

03:48.236 --> 03:50.155
- Mmm-mmm.
- [Bertie] Hello?

03:50.989 --> 03:52.032
Ah!

03:52.115 --> 03:54.076
- Hello, hello.
- [both] Hey.

03:54.159 --> 03:56.036
Uh, where's Randy at?

03:56.119 --> 03:57.830
- I don't know, his house?
- He's not here?

03:58.706 --> 04:01.542
- Randy!
- Maybe he was here earlier, but...

04:01.625 --> 04:03.711
- Randy!
- Yeah, I don't think he's here.

04:03.794 --> 04:04.795
Randy!

04:04.878 --> 04:06.254
[door opens]

04:07.422 --> 04:08.423
Hey.

04:10.508 --> 04:11.509
Hey, what's up? [exhales]

04:11.594 --> 04:14.930
Randy, I told you if Mickey comes home,
you have to tell her that you're here.

04:15.013 --> 04:16.613
Sorry, I... I didn't want to bother her.

04:16.640 --> 04:19.392
I was just in the back
reading a book about dinosaurs.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.894
Yeah, it's cool. Just a heads-up
next time would be nice.

04:21.978 --> 04:23.021
[Randy] For sure. Yeah.

04:23.105 --> 04:24.982
Man, I love your guys' place.

04:25.065 --> 04:27.192
It's, like, 100 times nicer than my place.

04:27.275 --> 04:29.945
My place is dank and dirty
and gross. [chuckles]

04:30.028 --> 04:32.489
You guys have towels
and toothpaste...

04:32.573 --> 04:34.407
So what are you guys up to tonight?

04:34.491 --> 04:36.201
I don't know. We're just gonna kick back.

04:36.284 --> 04:38.829
Maybe order some food,
watch a movie...

04:38.912 --> 04:40.748
Kind of a low key thing.

04:40.831 --> 04:43.166
I was in the middle of throwing out
some old shrooms.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.085
Ooh, really?

04:45.168 --> 04:46.712
Just gonna throw 'em out? [chuckles]

04:47.755 --> 04:49.632
- Do you want 'em?
- Yes, please.

04:49.715 --> 04:51.174
I didn't know you were into shrooms.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.260
Oh, well, a few years ago,
I spent a whole summer

04:53.343 --> 04:56.138
taking peyote with some skaters
and it changed my life.

04:56.221 --> 04:57.347
I want that summer.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.224
Last time I did shrooms
I had a bad trip

04:59.307 --> 05:01.018
and I haven't touched 'em since.
[chuckles]

05:01.101 --> 05:03.395
- Oh, you swore them off?
- Oh, no way.

05:03.478 --> 05:05.731
I've just been waiting for an opportunity
to do it right.

05:05.814 --> 05:08.233
- I can't wait to take back the shrooms.
- This is perfect.

05:08.316 --> 05:09.777
You three should do shrooms tonight.

05:09.860 --> 05:12.613
Ooh, yes, very cool.

05:12.696 --> 05:14.156
Yeah, I got no plans.
Let's do it.

05:14.239 --> 05:15.699
- Oh, I don't know.
- [Randy] Yeah.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.784
- [Bertie] Cool.
- [Randy] Yeah, that would be fun.

05:17.868 --> 05:19.202
Okay, cool.

05:19.286 --> 05:20.788
- [Mickey] Yeah.
- Very cool. Yeah.

05:20.871 --> 05:23.666
And I can be, like, the sober guide.
Your guru.

05:23.749 --> 05:26.877
I'll set it all up. Make sure you guys
have an excellent trip.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.880
Fantastic. Well, I'm gonna go
get my work clothes off,

05:29.963 --> 05:33.091
- and then we'll get to the magic.
- I am gonna take a bath.

05:35.886 --> 05:37.179
- What?
- What?

05:37.262 --> 05:39.639
- Are you sure you're okay with this?
- Yeah.

05:39.723 --> 05:40.766
This is gonna be fun.

05:40.849 --> 05:43.060
Yes. Should be fun.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.311
Are you scared?

05:44.394 --> 05:45.729
I'm a little scared.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.023
It's totally normal
before your first trip.

05:48.106 --> 05:50.358
Are you thinking, like,
"What if it's a bad trip

05:50.442 --> 05:52.569
and it breaks my brain
and I'm never the same?"

05:53.570 --> 05:56.907
I wasn't thinking that... no,

05:56.990 --> 05:59.659
but I'll gladly throw that onto the pile.

05:59.743 --> 06:02.162
Uh, no, I guess...

06:02.245 --> 06:03.580
Honestly, I just...

06:04.247 --> 06:05.874
I feel a little weird

06:05.958 --> 06:07.918
doing drugs in front of you
when you're sober.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.127
It doesn't feel right.

06:11.338 --> 06:12.715
That's so sweet, but,

06:12.798 --> 06:15.050
I never really had an issue with shrooms,
you know?

06:15.133 --> 06:17.219
- It's not like a real trigger for me.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:17.302 --> 06:19.387
And I think everybody should
try them once.

06:19.471 --> 06:20.597
They're incredible.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.058
Like, I don't fully trust someone
who's never tripped.

06:23.141 --> 06:26.561
It's like trusting someone
who still has a Hotmail account.

06:26.644 --> 06:29.856
Oh, yeah. It's like when you meet somebody
who hasn't seen <i>Die Hard.</i>

06:29.940 --> 06:32.192
And you're like... "Who are you?"

06:33.110 --> 06:35.654
- Yeah, everybody's seen <i>Die Hard.</i>
- You haven't seen <i>Die Hard?</i>

06:36.654 --> 06:38.656
[theme music playing]

06:55.298 --> 06:56.818
[Randy] The stems make you trip longer,

06:56.842 --> 06:59.803
but the caps will give you,
like, a deeper trip.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.638
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

07:01.721 --> 07:05.100
And, the thing is, they taste like shit,
but that's great.

07:05.183 --> 07:07.661
They're supposed to.
If it tastes like shit, it's a good thing.

07:07.685 --> 07:10.438
No, there's no reason
why they have to taste like shit.

07:10.522 --> 07:14.359
Take a sandwich.
See, you eat this, it masks the taste

07:14.442 --> 07:18.321
and it provides a good basis
in your stomach for digestion.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.741
- [Gus] Ah, okay. Genius.
- Mmm-hmm.

07:20.824 --> 07:22.700
That's good. Smart.

07:22.785 --> 07:24.745
All right. Down the hatch.

07:25.829 --> 07:26.955
[Mickey claps]

07:32.044 --> 07:33.378
[sighs]

07:38.341 --> 07:39.426
Mmm.

07:39.509 --> 07:42.304
So, like, how long does it typically
take to kick in?

07:42.387 --> 07:43.805
- Ten minutes.
- Like, an hour.

07:43.889 --> 07:45.015
Oh. [chuckles]

07:45.098 --> 07:47.017
Getting conflicting reports there.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.185
Oh, that's normal.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.687
It hits some people quicker than others.
It's all good.

07:54.357 --> 07:56.193
This actually is a really good sandwich.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.572
[mellow music playing]

08:03.491 --> 08:05.869
That's pretty much what you can do
with those things.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.162
[game rattles]

08:10.207 --> 08:12.417
I feel like I don't feel anything.

08:13.501 --> 08:16.629
But if you guys said you were
feeling something then,

08:16.713 --> 08:18.715
then I'm probably
feeling it, too.

08:20.258 --> 08:21.468
- I don't feel anything.
- Nah.

08:22.344 --> 08:23.846
What if we dance? Huh?

08:23.929 --> 08:25.889
- That's a good trick.
- Okay.

08:27.515 --> 08:28.683
[pop music playing]

08:28.766 --> 08:30.602
Get your asses up. Come on.

08:30.685 --> 08:34.188
You gotta do it big
and loud and stupid!

08:35.107 --> 08:37.359
- Bertie?
- Okay, yes.

08:39.986 --> 08:43.740
It gets that mushroom blood
straight to the brain.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.533
I'm gonna kill you
if you don't get up now.

08:45.617 --> 08:46.910
[Bertie] Come on, Randy.

08:47.870 --> 08:50.288
Move it. Groove it.

08:50.372 --> 08:51.623
More!

08:52.540 --> 08:53.959
Use your whole body.

09:19.484 --> 09:20.903
[Gus breathing heavily]

09:27.659 --> 09:28.911
How you doing there, bud?

09:29.536 --> 09:30.871
I'm good.

09:32.664 --> 09:35.125
[breathing heavily]
Are they kicking in?

09:35.208 --> 09:38.420
Can't say for sure, but it seems like
they might be kickin' in.

09:38.503 --> 09:40.088
Okay. This is gonna be fun.

09:41.006 --> 09:42.883
Yeah. [exhales deeply]

09:44.342 --> 09:45.468
Are they kickin' in?

09:48.180 --> 09:49.556
Hey... [grunts]

09:51.391 --> 09:52.600
[sighs]

09:52.684 --> 09:54.686
We're free to share
bad thoughts here, right?

09:55.812 --> 09:57.397
I don't want to ruin your trip,

09:57.480 --> 09:59.441
but I feel like if I, like,

09:59.524 --> 10:02.194
keep bad stuff in my head
and don't share it,

10:02.277 --> 10:03.528
then I'm gonna have a bad trip.

10:03.611 --> 10:06.239
- You know what I mean? Like...
- Totally.

10:06.323 --> 10:07.824
It's just like... [sighs]

10:08.866 --> 10:10.827
I look at this house
and I'm like...

10:11.912 --> 10:15.082
"Will I ever own a home like this?

10:15.165 --> 10:18.293
Or, am I just gonna be somebody
who lives in some...

10:19.211 --> 10:23.090
sad apartment his entire life
and then dies?"

10:23.881 --> 10:25.425
Yep.

10:25.508 --> 10:28.678
I live at the Springwood,
so that's like my entire existence.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.323
If I was gonna do something
significant with my life,

10:30.347 --> 10:32.140
it already would've happened by now.

10:32.224 --> 10:35.018
Right now, in our lives,
we're at that part, in a movie,

10:35.102 --> 10:38.230
when something cool
should start happening, but it's not.

10:39.147 --> 10:41.775
We're over a half an hour
into <i>Jurassic Park...</i>

10:42.692 --> 10:44.527
and the dinosaurs haven't even shown up.

10:45.570 --> 10:47.489
They're never gonna fuckin' show up.

10:48.073 --> 10:49.407
This candle...

10:51.076 --> 10:53.161
I look at this candle and I think...

10:54.079 --> 10:56.664
we all just want to be warm,
you know?

10:56.748 --> 10:59.209
Everyone on this planet...

10:59.292 --> 11:02.295
we're all just seeking warmth.
That's all we want.

11:03.254 --> 11:05.090
That's true. That's very cool.

11:06.633 --> 11:09.761
I don't wanna forget that I said that,
so can you write that down, please?

11:09.844 --> 11:12.305
My brain's not friends
with my hands right now.

11:12.722 --> 11:14.307
[both laugh]

11:20.522 --> 11:23.817
You wanna go outside? That usually
feels good when you're tripping.

11:24.817 --> 11:26.736
I trust you entirely at this point.

11:31.116 --> 11:32.117
[door opens]

11:37.122 --> 11:39.582
[Randy] Gus, this is a child's toy,

11:39.666 --> 11:41.418
but it is the tool of a man.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.086
[Randy and Gus laugh]

11:44.003 --> 11:46.256
Do you wanna hear
my American accent?

11:46.339 --> 11:47.465
Yeah.

11:47.549 --> 11:49.229
[American accent]
"I think Trask Industries

11:49.301 --> 11:50.968
should invest in the radio market."

11:51.053 --> 11:52.613
- Is that from <i>Working Girl?</i>
- [normal] Yes.

11:52.637 --> 11:55.140
- I'm a huge fan.
- Oh, me too.

11:55.223 --> 11:59.102
I love <i>Working Girl</i> so fucking much.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.896
Yeah. Han Solo looks great in a suit.

12:01.979 --> 12:06.068
Even after all these years,
human beings are still the same.

12:06.776 --> 12:11.198
Everybody talks about evolution,
but nobody talks about how long it takes.

12:11.281 --> 12:13.366
We're still not evolved.

12:13.450 --> 12:14.867
Really? You think?

12:14.951 --> 12:17.162
We have the brains of barbarians

12:17.245 --> 12:18.538
even though we don't live

12:18.621 --> 12:19.914
- in caves anymore.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:19.997 --> 12:24.877
We've, like, evolved properly
for hunting, for killing,

12:24.961 --> 12:26.921
and for sucking the blood
from animals.

12:27.004 --> 12:29.216
- Literally!
- Yes, I... I get it.

12:29.299 --> 12:30.939
- I get it, yeah. I get your point.
- Yes.

12:31.008 --> 12:33.428
I... Not... [stuttering]

12:33.511 --> 12:36.348
I'm not gonna kill you,
but if I want to kill you,

12:36.431 --> 12:37.682
I could...

12:37.765 --> 12:41.394
I could put my thumbs
through your eyeballs, like that,

12:41.478 --> 12:44.106
- and you'd be dead in a second.
- What?

12:44.189 --> 12:47.567
You know, Bertie, I feel like,
whether it's, like, tonight...

12:48.693 --> 12:51.529
or way, way, way, way in the future,
like, you and me...

12:52.322 --> 12:54.616
- we're gonna be friends forever.
- Definitely.

12:54.699 --> 12:56.159
I knew that when we first met,

12:56.243 --> 12:59.787
when we were just two crazy kids
carrying furniture.

12:59.871 --> 13:01.456
Right. On the lawn there.

13:01.539 --> 13:03.125
We... we were carrying in...

13:04.459 --> 13:05.502
your thing.

13:05.585 --> 13:06.961
- My dresser?
- Your dresser.

13:07.044 --> 13:10.507
Yeah. Oh, my God. That feels
like it was, like, a month ago.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.675
Well, it was like, three weeks ago. Yeah.

13:14.136 --> 13:16.554
We should move something again.
That felt good.

13:18.223 --> 13:22.810
I could take both of my hands
and smoosh your head...

13:22.894 --> 13:24.896
like a watermelon, right now.

13:24.979 --> 13:27.565
'Cause that is something
that's in my blood.

13:27.649 --> 13:29.317
I'm part barbarian,
you know what I mean?

13:30.402 --> 13:31.778
You... What are you doing?

13:31.861 --> 13:33.070
- Oh, my God.
- If I wanted to,

13:33.155 --> 13:35.823
I could put you in a bag
and hit you against a tree.

13:35.907 --> 13:38.326
I get it! You're big and you're strong.
'Kay, guys,

13:38.410 --> 13:40.703
can you please not do that
right now? Please?

13:40.787 --> 13:42.707
- It feels right.
- [Mickey] Well, it's official.

13:42.747 --> 13:44.207
You're all peaking.

13:45.208 --> 13:47.210
Excuse me. [sighs]
I gotta take care of something.

13:47.294 --> 13:50.463
The cavemen weren't even
that different from us.

13:50.547 --> 13:54.133
They grew hair on their face
just like I have on my face.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.512
[Gus and Bertie whooping and laughing]

14:00.014 --> 14:01.683
- [Randy laughing]
- [door opening]

14:02.642 --> 14:04.436
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

14:05.562 --> 14:06.563
[sighs]

14:06.646 --> 14:09.357
Seems like you guys
are havin' some fun out there.

14:09.441 --> 14:10.567
Mmm-hmm.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.694
- Maybe I should come join you.
- Yeah!

14:12.777 --> 14:15.738
You want to? I was just comin' in
to see if you wanna...

14:15.822 --> 14:17.199
pop on out where we're havin' fun.

14:18.032 --> 14:20.160
Maybe I'll take this little guy.

14:20.910 --> 14:23.496
- You think that's a good idea?
- They're not addictive.

14:23.580 --> 14:25.707
They're not really even a drug.

14:25.790 --> 14:27.417
Right. [sighs]

14:27.500 --> 14:31.754
Right, I just feel like it's not a...
good idea, 'cause, um...

14:35.217 --> 14:37.177
Sorry, it's really hard
to form an argument

14:37.260 --> 14:39.136
when I'm, like,
watching the bedspread swirl.

14:39.221 --> 14:40.430
- Um...
- You know what?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.890
Don't worry about it.
It's fine.

14:42.974 --> 14:45.685
No. Mickey, don't do it.

14:45.768 --> 14:47.729
- I just...
- Okay?

14:47.812 --> 14:50.106
- Oh, I really want to.
- No. Mickey, don't.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.608
It'll be fine. Calm down.

14:51.691 --> 14:52.984
- Don't do it. Don't.
- [grunts]

14:53.067 --> 14:56.070
- Don't, don't, don't.
- Fuck! Gus, what the fuck?

14:56.153 --> 14:58.030
[gulps and gasps] I'm sorry.

14:58.781 --> 15:00.533
I'm sorry. I just didn't want you to...

15:01.368 --> 15:02.452
Uh, fuck!

15:03.035 --> 15:04.371
Mickey, why did I do that?

15:04.454 --> 15:06.664
- Am I gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

15:06.748 --> 15:09.834
- Am I gonna die?
- No! You took a small dose to begin with.

15:09.917 --> 15:12.003
You're...
probably just gonna have more fun.

15:12.086 --> 15:14.046
[chuckles] Okay.

15:16.048 --> 15:18.175
Come here. Come here.

15:19.344 --> 15:20.637
[sighs] Oh, God.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.639
This tastes, like, so bad.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.433
I, like, totally get why you put it
in a peanut butter sandwich.

15:25.517 --> 15:27.602
[Randy] Holy fuck. Gus?

15:27.685 --> 15:28.853
Fuck's goin' on out there?

15:28.936 --> 15:31.814
- I don't know.
- There's a creature in the backyard here.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.234
There's a beast in the backyard!

15:34.317 --> 15:35.777
Gus.

15:37.069 --> 15:40.156
Oh, shit. That's a coyote.

15:40.240 --> 15:44.076
[chuckles] That is... one handsome animal.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.162
Dude, don't go near him.
He can hurt you.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.330
His coat.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.457
He's so majestic.

15:50.333 --> 15:51.709
[breathing heavily]

15:51.793 --> 15:53.545
[clicking tongue]

15:55.046 --> 15:56.047
<i>Coyote.</i>

15:56.130 --> 15:58.925
[Mickey] Hey, that's a wild animal.
How about we leave him alone?

15:59.008 --> 16:01.928
Definitely back off, 'cause its, like,
teeth could rip at your flesh.

16:02.011 --> 16:05.390
Oh, no, no.
He's one of the good ones.

16:06.391 --> 16:07.559
Aren't you, buddy?

16:07.642 --> 16:10.687
You and I aren't that different.
We're both... beasts.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.689
- [whines softly]
- But you are covered in fur.

16:13.315 --> 16:14.524
And I am in flesh.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.276
Neither of you have jobs.

16:16.359 --> 16:18.946
<i>Coyote. Coyote.</i>

16:19.028 --> 16:21.072
Randy. <i>Coyote.</i>

16:21.989 --> 16:23.324
Randy. <i>Coyote.</i>

16:23.408 --> 16:25.910
- Okay, enough with that.
- I can feel his essence.

16:25.993 --> 16:28.913
He's here for a reason.
Don't you guys feel that?

16:28.996 --> 16:31.333
- No... not really.
- [Bertie and Gus] No.

16:31.416 --> 16:33.334
- Hey, let's go back inside.
- [clicking tongue]

16:33.418 --> 16:36.754
- [Gus] Yeah, Randy, I...
- [Randy] Oh, no. No.

16:36.838 --> 16:39.299
- No, Randy. Stop. Oh, shit.
- [Gus] Randy! Randy!

16:39.382 --> 16:40.967
- [Mickey] Dude, come on!
- [Gus] No!

16:41.050 --> 16:42.594
[Gus] They don't like to be chased.

16:42.677 --> 16:44.846
- [Mickey] Randy, stop. Shit.
- [Randy] No. No.

16:52.687 --> 16:54.939
- [Mickey] Fuck! Shit.
- [Bertie] Randy.

16:55.022 --> 16:56.774
[Mickey] Randy, seriously, stop.

16:56.858 --> 16:58.568
Listen to me, I am your guide.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.945
[panting] You're not my guide.

17:01.028 --> 17:02.488
This <i>coyote</i> is my guide.

17:02.572 --> 17:05.617
Randy, why don't you choose
another animal to be your guide?

17:05.700 --> 17:08.328
Like a nice bird or a squirrel?

17:08.411 --> 17:11.539
Yeah, I gotta say, shroom buddy,
this isn't the smartest move right now.

17:11.623 --> 17:13.249
I gotta follow him.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.291
My friend. Wait for me.

17:15.376 --> 17:18.796
- Ugh. I feel sick runnin' so fast.
- Okay, that's common on shrooms.

17:18.880 --> 17:20.506
Try and keep a low center of gravity.

17:20.589 --> 17:22.174
- Okay.
- Okay?

17:44.655 --> 17:46.074
[Mickey] Randy, come back, dude.

17:46.157 --> 17:48.868
You don't get it.
He'll show me my destiny.

17:48.951 --> 17:50.220
Gus knows what I'm talkin' about.

17:50.244 --> 17:52.997
The coyote. My legacy. He knows it.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.416
The coyote doesn't know anything.

17:54.499 --> 17:56.101
The Native Americans say
that they're wise.

17:56.125 --> 17:59.504
- You disagree with them, Gus?
- Oh, now this is getting scary.

17:59.587 --> 18:01.464
He's really starting to scare me.

18:01.547 --> 18:04.300
[groans] Jesus Christ.
I am the worst drug guide ever.

18:15.978 --> 18:17.063
[chuckles]

18:17.146 --> 18:18.230
[exhales in awe]

18:18.314 --> 18:19.524
Randy?

18:22.569 --> 18:24.946
[breathing heavily] This house.

18:25.029 --> 18:26.573
This house is beautiful.

18:26.656 --> 18:29.284
This house is the answer the <i>coyote</i>
was leading me to.

18:29.366 --> 18:31.869
[Gus] I don't know, Randy.
This house is pretty basic.

18:31.953 --> 18:33.455
This is my home.

18:35.665 --> 18:36.958
Stop, Randy.

18:37.041 --> 18:38.710
That's trespassing.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.753
I gotta get in.

18:41.712 --> 18:43.756
[whispers] Randy. Don't, don't, don't.

18:43.840 --> 18:46.175
Come on.
This is starting to feel illegal, man.

18:46.258 --> 18:47.969
There's always more than one opening.

18:48.052 --> 18:49.846
Randy. No, do not go in there. No.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.764
Randy, you're acting like a maniac.

18:51.848 --> 18:53.600
[Gus] Randy, don't.

18:53.683 --> 18:55.828
- [Mickey] Don't do that.
- [Bertie] Stop that, please.

18:55.852 --> 18:58.038
- [Gus] Don't do that.
- [Bertie] Put it back on the window.

18:58.062 --> 19:00.272
Randy, listen to me.
Get away from that house.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.543
- [Gus] Randy. Randy, don't.
- [Mickey] Randy, don't. No.

19:02.567 --> 19:05.486
- [Mickey] Please. Please don't do this!
- [Bertie] Randy, no!

19:05.570 --> 19:07.447
- [Randy grunts] Ow.
- [Bertie] Randy.

19:07.530 --> 19:09.490
[Randy] Wow.
This guy's got a lot of books.

19:09.574 --> 19:11.200
[sighs] I'm gonna go handle this.

19:11.283 --> 19:13.244
I can do this. I'm not that messed up.

19:13.327 --> 19:14.927
Dude, you are super messed up right now.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.706
Your eyeballs are, like,
30 feet wide.

19:16.789 --> 19:17.832
No, they're not.

19:17.915 --> 19:19.584
- I can do this. I...
- [Bertie] Randy.

19:19.667 --> 19:22.670
Don't run away. Help me.
Pull me in. [grunts]

19:22.754 --> 19:24.922
- [sighs]
- Yeah, I got this.

19:25.006 --> 19:27.049
- [Bertie] Ow!
- [Gus] Bertie, I'm behind you.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.926
- Keep the window open.
- [sighs] Oh, my God.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.639
[whispering] Randy.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.183
Randy.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.651
[whispering] Randy?

19:50.615 --> 19:52.033
Randy?

19:56.203 --> 19:58.039
I smell him.

20:05.046 --> 20:07.339
- [whispering] Come on, Bertie.
- Oh, did you see this?

20:07.423 --> 20:09.592
Yes. It's a stove.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.178
- We have to find Randy.
- Okay.

20:12.261 --> 20:14.764
Randy? Randy?

20:15.765 --> 20:18.560
Jesus Christ, man.
Come on. Dude.

20:19.477 --> 20:21.270
[Randy] Why can't I have a bed like this?

20:21.353 --> 20:23.272
It's firm but soft on top.

20:23.355 --> 20:24.816
I love this bed, Gus.

20:24.899 --> 20:26.400
- Okay, all right, Randy.
- Mmm?

20:26.483 --> 20:28.444
Hey, we really shouldn't be here, okay?

20:28.528 --> 20:30.738
The coyote helped you out,
and that's awesome...

20:30.822 --> 20:33.324
but we need to get home now.
Okay, buddy?

20:33.407 --> 20:35.743
I don't wanna get home.
I'm very comfortable here.

20:35.826 --> 20:38.120
- Everything I need is here.
- I know.

20:38.204 --> 20:39.914
I know, but we should get out of here.

20:39.997 --> 20:41.373
- Okay, let's go.
- Randy, please.

20:41.457 --> 20:45.502
- I really don't like what's happening.
- [sighs] Oh, my God.

20:45.587 --> 20:47.714
You are so in your head right now.

20:47.797 --> 20:50.382
What's happening to you
is irrelevant to me.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.009
I'm not going anywhere.

20:52.093 --> 20:54.261
This is breaking and entering,
you idiots.

20:54.345 --> 20:55.930
I'm very happy here.

20:56.681 --> 20:58.891
- Oh, no.
- Shit.

20:58.975 --> 21:00.142
Oh, great, they're home.

21:00.226 --> 21:01.477
That could be anybody.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.201
Oh, Randy, I'm begging you,
please get up.

21:03.271 --> 21:05.273
You know what? We gotta go.
I'll help you, okay?

21:05.356 --> 21:07.734
- [grunting]
- No. You guys can go.

21:07.817 --> 21:08.860
Jesus.

21:08.943 --> 21:10.987
I need to chill here,
and await the next message.

21:11.070 --> 21:14.281
- Help me out here, Randy. Come on.
- Just fucking hurry. Enough of this.

21:14.365 --> 21:16.075
Let's get the fucking show on the road.

21:16.158 --> 21:18.745
- [Bertie] Oh, God. Oh, God.
- [breathes shakily] Randy?

21:18.828 --> 21:21.538
You are being a rude asshole right now.

21:21.623 --> 21:23.750
You're on drugs,
and you're gonna fuck up our lives.

21:23.833 --> 21:26.127
So stop being a rude asshole!

21:27.378 --> 21:28.420
Yeah, okay.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.566
- Come on. Just leave the blanket.
- [Mickey] Go! Go!

21:30.590 --> 21:32.759
You're gonna leave the fucking blanket,
Randy.

21:32.842 --> 21:36.387
[Mickey] Come on, come on, come on.
Okay. Okay, good, good. Oh, shit.

21:36.470 --> 21:37.513
Okay, we gotta go.

21:48.733 --> 21:50.067
[laughs]

21:50.985 --> 21:52.028
[Bertie laughs]

21:52.945 --> 21:54.238
[Gus laughs]

21:56.991 --> 21:58.367
[laughter continues]

22:00.452 --> 22:02.454
[Randy] That was fucking crazy.

22:02.538 --> 22:03.998
[Gus continues laughing]

22:14.801 --> 22:16.719
Hey, are you still tripping?

22:16.803 --> 22:19.681
Mmm... Not so much.

22:19.764 --> 22:23.100
I mean, I have little pockets
here and there, but...

22:23.184 --> 22:24.351
I think I'm done.

22:24.435 --> 22:26.603
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

22:26.688 --> 22:27.980
[sighs]

22:28.773 --> 22:31.317
I felt, like, I, like,
actually learned, like...

22:31.400 --> 22:33.820
like a really good lesson tonight.

22:33.903 --> 22:36.572
- Oh, yeah, what?
- Like...

22:37.364 --> 22:39.408
It's really fun to do drugs?

22:39.491 --> 22:41.368
[chuckles]

22:41.452 --> 22:45.581
Not the most profound takeaway,
but I like the spirit of it.

22:46.415 --> 22:48.918
I don't know, it's cool.
It's like, um...

22:51.295 --> 22:52.975
you pushed me a little
closer to the ledge.

22:53.047 --> 22:54.340
Yeah.

22:54.423 --> 22:57.509
And you... you pulled me back from it.

22:57.593 --> 22:59.303
[sighs deeply]

23:02.681 --> 23:05.226
Yeah.
I'd say it's a good team, you know?

23:05.309 --> 23:07.519
- Mmm-hmm.
- Fuck! Shit.

23:07.603 --> 23:08.771
Sorry.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.440
- Sorry, Micks.
- It's cool.

23:12.483 --> 23:13.985
[Gus] Oh.

23:15.611 --> 23:19.656
What's this hot little number?
Huh? Remember this?

23:19.741 --> 23:21.158
You wanna put it on?

23:21.242 --> 23:23.202
I was just gonna ask,
"Could I put it on?"

23:23.285 --> 23:24.829
- Yeah?
- Do it.

23:26.205 --> 23:27.373
Okay.

23:28.665 --> 23:30.376
It's my kind of weird.

23:30.459 --> 23:31.627
[inhales deeply]

23:32.544 --> 23:33.796
Oh, look.

23:34.713 --> 23:36.048
It's my size.

23:36.132 --> 23:38.050
- Look good?
- Mmm!

23:40.136 --> 23:41.262
[chuckles]

23:41.345 --> 23:42.554
[laughing]

23:44.098 --> 23:45.391
[Bertie] Weird night.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.434
[Randy grunts]

23:49.228 --> 23:52.689
I feel like maybe you felt the shrooms
a bit more strongly than me.

23:54.776 --> 23:57.319
- [exhales] They weren't that strong.
- Really?

23:57.903 --> 23:59.947
Randy, you broke into someone's house.

24:00.031 --> 24:01.532
[grunts softly]

24:01.615 --> 24:02.950
Why did you do that?

24:03.034 --> 24:05.787
Coyote, and then Gus said I should go in.

24:05.870 --> 24:08.122
Oh, no, we all said
you definitely shouldn't go in.

24:08.205 --> 24:09.206
[Randy sighs]

24:09.290 --> 24:10.707
I'm so sleepy.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.836
Please, just let me sleepy.

24:16.463 --> 24:19.591
Otherwise... I might have to kill you.

24:20.593 --> 24:21.719
[chuckles]

24:22.219 --> 24:25.765
Randy? Shut up. [stammers] No, you won't.

24:27.016 --> 24:28.350
I'll squish your head.

24:30.352 --> 24:31.395
I'll kill you.

24:32.479 --> 24:34.315
I'll drown you.

24:34.398 --> 24:36.067
I'm part barbarian.

24:37.860 --> 24:39.486
[laughs]

24:46.118 --> 24:47.328
You're so pretty.

24:48.996 --> 24:50.664
- Thank you.
- No, I mean it. Like...

24:50.747 --> 24:52.666
You're, like, beautiful.

24:52.749 --> 24:55.752
In a, like,
a classic sort of way,

24:55.837 --> 24:59.548
like, you look like a movie star
from the '30s.

24:59.631 --> 25:01.884
Like that one who, like,
died in the plane crash.

25:01.968 --> 25:03.344
Who's that?

25:04.553 --> 25:06.555
- I don't know. I forget. [chuckling]
- [chuckles]

25:06.638 --> 25:08.765
I'm just saying, like...

25:08.850 --> 25:12.269
if I saw, like, an old movie
and your face was in it,

25:12.353 --> 25:14.981
like, even if you were, like, in a crowd,

25:15.064 --> 25:16.983
like, way back in the background,

25:17.066 --> 25:19.902
I would, like, notice you
and I would go, like...

25:19.986 --> 25:23.780
[gasps] "Oh, my God.
She's so beautiful."

25:25.157 --> 25:26.200
[chuckles softly]

25:26.283 --> 25:28.494
- Well, I think you're beautiful.
- [groans] Oh...

25:29.203 --> 25:31.788
No, you don't have to say that.

25:33.582 --> 25:35.626
I know I'm not
one of the beautiful people.

25:35.709 --> 25:37.003
I got this...

25:37.962 --> 25:39.505
nose.

25:39.588 --> 25:42.216
- It's weird lookin' and big, and...
- Mmm-mmm.

25:42.299 --> 25:43.842
I love your nose.

25:45.636 --> 25:46.803
Thank you, Mickey.

25:53.895 --> 25:55.062
Do you think I'm a fuck-up?

25:55.729 --> 25:56.856
No.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.275
No, not at all.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.027
Oh, my God, you're...

26:02.653 --> 26:04.173
You're like the opposite of a fuck-up.

26:04.238 --> 26:07.491
It's like you wake up every morning,
and you, like, face the day.

26:07.574 --> 26:10.577
I wish I could be, like,
as courageous as you, seriously.

26:11.745 --> 26:14.999
I mean, you're beautiful, like,
outside, but also, like...

26:18.294 --> 26:20.212
You have, like, a beautiful soul.

26:23.257 --> 26:26.885
"We are beautiful... in every single way.

26:26.969 --> 26:29.680
Words can't bring us down."

26:31.223 --> 26:34.851
"So don't you bring us down... today."

26:34.936 --> 26:36.103
Mmm.

26:37.688 --> 26:39.356
The wisdom of Miss Aguilera.

26:39.982 --> 26:41.608
[inhales deeply]

26:42.526 --> 26:44.153
[softly] Guidin' us as always.

26:50.617 --> 26:51.827
All right.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.412
- You wanna finish this?
- Yeah, sure.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.372
[Gus grunts]

26:57.333 --> 26:58.375
What?

26:58.459 --> 27:00.794
- You don't wanna take that off, do you?
- Fuck, no.

27:00.877 --> 27:02.964
- All right. Do you.
- [softly] I don't.

27:03.047 --> 27:04.048
[chuckles]

27:06.092 --> 27:07.551
[inaudible]

27:15.351 --> 27:17.894
- [chuckles] Like...
- Through here.

27:17.978 --> 27:20.105
No, no, no, no! Like this.
