A NETFLIX SERIES

01:39.708 --> 01:42.000
Listen, would you please
turn down the music?

01:42.583 --> 01:44.541
You can hear it
all the way down the block.

01:45.250 --> 01:46.250
Okay?

01:46.958 --> 01:48.750
And if I won't, what will you do?

01:51.250 --> 01:53.583
-I-- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--
-Pissed off?

01:53.666 --> 01:56.083
No, no, no,
that's what I'm saying.

01:56.166 --> 01:58.708
Ask me to turn it down.
Ask me like a man.

01:58.791 --> 02:00.916
-No.
-You said my music's too loud.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.458
So ask me like a man!

03:21.916 --> 03:23.875
-How is she?
-A little better.

03:24.916 --> 03:26.125
Well, it comes and goes.

03:26.916 --> 03:27.875
And you?

03:28.458 --> 03:29.916
All right, I suppose.

03:31.125 --> 03:32.875
The woman you hit is in the hospital.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.125
Are you sure?

03:35.208 --> 03:37.833
I asked the police
when I was pretending to be a neighbor.

03:38.916 --> 03:39.875
Okay.

03:41.916 --> 03:44.125
Here are the fake passports
that I promised.

03:44.208 --> 03:47.291
I've got you both on a plane to Montreal
leaving in two days.

03:47.375 --> 03:49.875
He wants to kill you both.
We don't have a choice.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.541
This is Mom's name.

03:57.125 --> 03:58.291
Yes, her maiden name.

03:59.458 --> 04:01.166
You'll keep your first names.

04:02.708 --> 04:04.875
I own a house over there. It's yours now.

04:04.958 --> 04:06.333
I signed it over to you.

04:06.416 --> 04:08.125
Thank you, but I can't accept it, Mehdi.

04:08.208 --> 04:12.041
Anisse, you're my baby sister.
You both are all that I have left.

04:13.875 --> 04:14.958
Then come with us.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.041
You're all that we have left too.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.125
What?

04:19.208 --> 04:22.500
You're just going to stay out here,
alone in the woods like a hermit?

04:23.000 --> 04:24.416
I told you, Mehdi.

04:24.916 --> 04:27.208
What happened to Ilyes wasn't your fault.

04:27.750 --> 04:29.708
You have to left go of it, all right?

04:31.041 --> 04:33.166
Just promise you'll think about Montreal.

04:34.083 --> 04:34.958
Okay.

05:13.291 --> 05:14.416
Who are you?

05:15.583 --> 05:17.416
Just a person who can help you.

05:18.416 --> 05:22.041
You, your niece, and your sister,
and the girl from the heist.

05:22.125 --> 05:24.750
If you're working with Djebli,
then your boss knows where I stand.

05:24.833 --> 05:27.416
I know. You won't bring him the girl.

05:27.500 --> 05:30.916
And I'm sure by now you're getting them
out of Brussels. Her and your family.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.833
But what if they could stay?

05:33.416 --> 05:35.791
If you wanted,
they could have their lives back.

05:36.833 --> 05:39.625
The police are looking for the girl.
You know she has no other option.

05:39.708 --> 05:41.583
We have contacts in the police.

05:41.666 --> 05:42.750
In high positions.

05:42.833 --> 05:46.208
We can convince the detectives
they got the wrong suspect.

05:46.291 --> 05:50.208
I just want to meet with you
to propose my offer in person.

05:50.291 --> 05:52.625
I have my own plan.

05:53.208 --> 05:54.458
I'd rather stick to that.

05:54.958 --> 05:57.666
In that case, know that my proposition
will expire tonight.

05:58.375 --> 06:00.333
After that, we're going after the girl.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.041
Hey, how's the hotel?

06:46.666 --> 06:47.666
It's a shithole.

06:51.458 --> 06:53.375
Have you guys heard anything
from Modi's sister?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.750
No. The funeral is tomorrow,
in the afternoon.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.125
Sure you still want to go?

07:06.625 --> 07:07.500
Why are you here?

07:08.583 --> 07:10.541
I told you not to leave the hotel.

07:10.625 --> 07:12.458
They're coming after you, Liana.

07:13.458 --> 07:14.500
Leave us.

07:24.583 --> 07:27.333
-You should be at the hotel.
-You thought I'd stay locked up there?

07:27.416 --> 07:28.750
When can I see Shaïnez?

07:28.833 --> 07:32.500
Not yet.
I'll have your new passport tomorrow.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.875
-Do you know where you want to go?
-Well, yeah.

07:35.875 --> 07:38.708
-I'll stay here.
-Liana, don't do this. You won't be safe.

07:38.791 --> 07:40.291
Did I ask you?

07:41.208 --> 07:43.666
You don't get to tell me what to do.
Got it?

07:44.250 --> 07:45.916
It's not like you're my dad, okay?

07:46.750 --> 07:47.708
Do we owe each other?

07:53.291 --> 07:54.333
You got a problem?

07:57.750 --> 07:59.041
Let me help you.

07:59.750 --> 08:00.750
I'm not leaving.

08:03.333 --> 08:04.333
Got nothing to lose.

09:20.166 --> 09:22.916
-Hello?
-You'd better call your police contacts.

09:23.500 --> 09:26.000
Tell them to drop the charges
against the girl.

09:26.083 --> 09:27.583
You'll meet me at ten tonight.

09:28.166 --> 09:30.000
-I'll send you the address.
-Okay.

10:09.166 --> 10:11.166
I told you not to come visit me.

10:11.833 --> 10:13.916
Did you really think I wouldn't be here?

10:20.083 --> 10:21.416
How is Danique?

10:23.250 --> 10:24.375
Her pelvis is fractured.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.125
Her wrist too.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.625
The rest isn't serious.

10:27.708 --> 10:28.791
How long before she's back?

10:29.375 --> 10:31.541
Eight or nine months.
She had her first operation,

10:31.625 --> 10:33.250
and she's waiting for her second.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.708
Why did you come to see me?

10:39.291 --> 10:40.916
'Cause you're getting out of here.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.625
I've been sentenced to 15 years.

10:45.375 --> 10:47.416
The judge will not change the verdict,

10:47.500 --> 10:49.583
and reducing my time isn't an option.

10:49.666 --> 10:51.250
Look, I'm getting you out of here.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.958
Tomorrow is your last court date
with the judge.

10:56.041 --> 10:59.375
And I will send in men
to intercept your convoy.

10:59.458 --> 11:03.750
Believe me, Sofia,
if I knew any men capable of doing that,

11:03.833 --> 11:05.833
I would've asked them on my own already.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.583
You know one.

11:08.166 --> 11:09.708
The guy who robbed the docks.

11:11.541 --> 11:15.833
The only thing you could make him do
is kill me, all right?

11:17.750 --> 11:18.916
Trust me on this.

11:20.166 --> 11:21.458
That's all I'm asking.

11:25.375 --> 11:28.875
Sofia, the only person
I can actually trust…

11:29.500 --> 11:30.666
is you.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.083
Saber, call me back.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.583
Or text me,
but I need to hear from you, okay?

12:15.791 --> 12:16.625
Enough.

12:20.958 --> 12:22.000
What do you want?

12:23.500 --> 12:24.916
I want my wife.

12:27.541 --> 12:29.541
Go. Get out of here.

12:31.416 --> 12:32.250
Please leave.

12:51.833 --> 12:53.708
Look the other away!

12:55.750 --> 12:57.166
Put your hands on the wheel.

12:58.208 --> 12:59.750
Have you done what I asked?

13:01.333 --> 13:02.166
Yes.

13:03.291 --> 13:04.250
May I?

13:04.333 --> 13:05.666
Go ahead.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.500
They dropped the charges.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.416
All they have on her now
is a license violation from a year ago.

13:17.666 --> 13:20.625
Last year, Hassan was convicted
of drug trafficking.

13:20.708 --> 13:22.541
He's just been arrested.

13:22.625 --> 13:23.583
How many years?

13:24.916 --> 13:25.875
Fifteen.

13:26.625 --> 13:29.000
But if you think that's good news,
you're wrong.

13:29.791 --> 13:31.833
Even behind bars,
he'll track them all down.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.500
Your niece, your sister,
and that girl Liana.

13:35.375 --> 13:36.500
What do you want?

13:37.083 --> 13:39.958
Tomorrow is his last appearance in court
before prison.

13:41.416 --> 13:43.958
You'll break him out and bring him to me…

13:44.041 --> 13:45.166
and kill him for me.

13:45.750 --> 13:48.000
I thought he was your boss.
What's your angle?

13:49.833 --> 13:51.125
He killed my parents.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.583
I want him dead.

13:55.250 --> 13:57.375
I've got two million in cash in the back.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.250
You'll get six more when he's dead.

14:19.416 --> 14:23.083
I have your name and your address.
Try to screw me, and I'll kill you.

14:23.666 --> 14:24.958
Does that mean you accept?

14:25.041 --> 14:26.791
Means I'll consider it.

14:28.333 --> 14:30.375
I'm taking the money for my trouble.

14:38.583 --> 14:40.000
We're watching.

14:48.666 --> 14:50.000
-Huh?
-You good?

15:01.416 --> 15:02.791
You sure about this plan?

15:03.625 --> 15:04.500
No.

15:05.833 --> 15:06.875
Then why do it?

15:08.458 --> 15:10.458
Look, guys, if we do this, we're dead.

15:11.291 --> 15:12.333
You're right, man.

15:12.416 --> 15:14.916
Maybe we die, but maybe we're rich.

15:15.583 --> 15:19.250
Eight million, guys. Eight million.
I mean, that's two million each.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.583
We do this job,
we don't have to do this anymore.

15:22.416 --> 15:25.458
Okay, I mean, say we do it. Then what?

15:25.541 --> 15:27.958
We kill him in a vacant lot
and bury the guy?

15:28.041 --> 15:30.750
'Cause that's what we're looking at
if we want the full eight mil.

15:31.416 --> 15:32.916
We only shoot in self-defense.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.541
We do, but now I have no choice.

15:34.625 --> 15:37.041
If you send your sister and your niece
to Canada…

15:37.750 --> 15:39.166
it's all in the past.

15:39.250 --> 15:40.833
For them, but not for Liana.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.833
So you mean
you're doing this for that girl?

15:45.916 --> 15:47.750
You tried to help her, all right?

15:48.333 --> 15:49.583
And she wants to stay.

15:50.250 --> 15:53.125
So, I'm sorry,
but I'm out on this one, man.

15:54.416 --> 15:55.250
Mm.

15:56.166 --> 15:57.208
Okay, I get it.

15:59.541 --> 16:00.625
Jordan, are you in?

16:01.208 --> 16:04.333
Hey, bro, don't say yes
just because I did.

16:04.416 --> 16:05.750
-Think about it.
-I know.

16:09.083 --> 16:11.000
Who does that bitch think she is, huh?

16:12.583 --> 16:14.708
Arnaud's right.
We're not killers. We don't do that.

16:15.291 --> 16:16.291
I'm in, but…

16:17.125 --> 16:19.750
I say we deliver the guy
and let her take care of it.

16:19.833 --> 16:20.833
That'll be okay.

16:24.416 --> 16:25.250
Okay.

16:35.958 --> 16:38.000
-Hello?
-I'll deliver the guy, but you kill him.

16:39.208 --> 16:42.750
-If I wanted you to do it, it's because--
-That or nothing. Take it or leave it.

16:45.875 --> 16:46.708
All right.

16:47.291 --> 16:49.541
I need the convoy's departure time
and the route.

16:49.625 --> 16:50.625
I'm working on it.

16:50.708 --> 16:53.458
Well, you'd better get it to us fast,
or we'll call it off.

16:53.541 --> 16:55.583
-I'll keep you posted.
-I'm not finished.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.125
We want the rest of the money upfront.

16:58.208 --> 16:59.750
It's non-negotiable.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.791
Now you're pushing it too far.

17:01.875 --> 17:04.041
There's a baggage check
at the Brussels-Midi Station.

17:04.125 --> 17:07.208
Put the money in bags like the
two million and put them in a locker.

17:07.291 --> 17:08.333
Text me the number.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.750
I'll need you to pick up the money.

17:17.541 --> 17:20.000
Bring it to my place.
I'll send you the address.

17:20.083 --> 17:20.916
Okay.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.250
-Thanks.
-Okay.

17:35.541 --> 17:37.208
You'll have access to the file.

17:37.291 --> 17:40.083
It's only the start of the investigation.
It's to be expected.

17:41.541 --> 17:42.416
Yeah.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.416
-I'll see you in there.
-See you soon.

17:53.416 --> 17:54.708
What are you doing here?

17:56.708 --> 17:57.833
I need you, Antoine.

18:00.541 --> 18:02.583
My uncle has an appearance here today.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.333
I need the route

18:06.333 --> 18:08.125
and departure time for his convoy.

18:11.125 --> 18:12.291
How dare you ask me that.

18:13.166 --> 18:14.666
I never want to see you again.

18:18.541 --> 18:21.458
If you don't help me,
I'll go to the judge who convicted him.

18:22.041 --> 18:23.250
I'll say you helped him,

18:23.958 --> 18:27.458
and that if it weren't for you,
he wouldn't have left Belgium pretrial.

18:30.125 --> 18:33.750
Even if we slept together for a while,
no judge would buy that, Sofia.

18:44.583 --> 18:46.666
I have your child. I don't need any proof.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.041
Just think about it.

18:55.333 --> 18:56.333
You're insane.

19:16.666 --> 19:18.250
The money's at the station.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.041
I'll text you the locker numbers.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.458
You got the info on the route?

19:21.541 --> 19:22.500
Not yet.

19:22.583 --> 19:24.125
I told you to find it fast.

19:24.208 --> 19:26.083
And I told you you'll get it in time.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.833
Money's at the station.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.875
You're so beautiful when you're pissed.

19:56.958 --> 19:58.916
I'd like to thank you.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.666
You can't imagine what I would've done
to you if you hadn't found my coke.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.625
But we still have a problem.

20:06.583 --> 20:07.666
Your cousin.

20:07.750 --> 20:11.750
You promised that Saber would go free
if I got it back, so keep your word.

20:12.333 --> 20:15.416
I can't let people believe they can
steal from me and get away with it.

20:15.916 --> 20:17.833
I have customers and suppliers.

20:18.416 --> 20:22.333
Do you think that I'll be respected
if I don't kill the culprit?

20:28.208 --> 20:29.875
It wasn't Saber who organized the heist.

20:31.625 --> 20:32.916
Who was it, then?

20:33.000 --> 20:33.958
Hassan did it.

20:36.833 --> 20:37.958
Why would he do that?

20:39.458 --> 20:42.416
He was sick of having to pay your tax
on his coke imports.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.041
When he left Brussels,
you used it to double your price.

20:45.125 --> 20:46.833
Did you expect him to just sit by?

20:53.916 --> 20:55.541
All right, so tell me…

20:57.000 --> 20:58.041
what do I do…

20:58.875 --> 21:00.500
with your uncle being in prison?

21:04.708 --> 21:05.750
I'll break him out.

21:08.875 --> 21:09.875
How you gonna do that?

21:10.458 --> 21:11.791
The robbers from the docks.

21:12.791 --> 21:13.833
Ah…

21:14.916 --> 21:16.291
That's perfect, Sofia.

21:18.333 --> 21:19.875
I'll forget about Saber

21:20.500 --> 21:21.833
and take care of Hassan.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.916
But the robbers go down too.

21:24.000 --> 21:24.958
No.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.583
They had no part in it.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.625
Hassan forced them into it.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.750
Your man is Hassan.

21:40.916 --> 21:43.125
Do you remember
what we talked about?

21:43.208 --> 21:45.083
About how we can't ever go back home?

21:49.125 --> 21:50.666
Mehdi found us a new house.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.041
You'll see, we'll be safe there.

21:53.125 --> 21:55.083
-We can start over.
-Where is it?

21:57.583 --> 21:59.625
-In Canada. In Montreal.
-What?

22:02.250 --> 22:04.833
Look, if we have to move, fine,
but I'm not moving to Montreal.

22:04.916 --> 22:07.958
-We can't stay in Belgium, Shaïnez.
-No, I'm not going, okay?

22:09.291 --> 22:10.583
Shaïnez, please.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.375
No, I'm sorry, but I'm not going.
It's too far.

22:15.458 --> 22:16.458
Are you crazy?

22:41.791 --> 22:43.291
What's your problem?

22:44.625 --> 22:45.750
I'm speaking to you.

22:47.041 --> 22:48.416
What is your problem?

22:50.583 --> 22:52.166
Do you think I wanted to leave?

22:53.708 --> 22:55.041
You got us into this shit.

22:56.333 --> 22:59.041
So you need to talk to me, Shaïnez.
What's going on?

23:01.000 --> 23:02.500
Mehdi told me about that girl.

23:03.708 --> 23:05.750
-Lana? Lina? I don't know.
-Liana.

23:06.791 --> 23:08.166
Did she make you do this?

23:10.250 --> 23:12.000
Did she force you to be an escort?

23:12.083 --> 23:15.416
No, it was me. It was my idea.
She didn't even want me to do it.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.250
But what's going on with her?

23:18.291 --> 23:19.375
What is it?

23:21.250 --> 23:24.791
Hey, what is it? Are you two friends? What?

23:24.875 --> 23:26.083
You care for her?

23:26.958 --> 23:27.916
Do you love her?

23:33.125 --> 23:34.875
Is that why you don't want to go?

23:35.833 --> 23:36.958
Is that it?

23:37.041 --> 23:39.041
Shaïnez…

23:46.958 --> 23:49.416
I love you. You're my everything.

24:00.291 --> 24:02.791
We gotta go. What are you gonna do?

24:04.041 --> 24:05.541
Go ahead. I'll be here.

24:07.083 --> 24:08.666
Okay. Let's go.

24:30.875 --> 24:32.875
I WANT TO SEE YOU…

24:48.166 --> 24:52.500
MEET YOU IN AN HOUR AT MY UNCLE'S PLACE

25:16.416 --> 25:18.000
There's the little thief.

25:22.166 --> 25:23.041
Follow her.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.208
Saber.

26:22.500 --> 26:23.750
If I agree to do it…

26:25.083 --> 26:26.958
will you promise to get an abortion?

26:29.041 --> 26:30.041
I'm having a girl.

26:31.333 --> 26:32.333
And I'm keeping her.

26:36.583 --> 26:38.708
If you help me,
you won't hear about her ever again.

26:39.458 --> 26:41.333
And the judge will never know about us.

27:42.625 --> 27:45.625
CONVOY ROUTE

27:45.708 --> 27:47.708
COURTHOUSE

27:52.000 --> 27:54.208
FORWARDING

27:54.291 --> 27:56.625
There will be a car
leading the convoy.

27:56.708 --> 27:58.208
A van…

27:59.291 --> 28:00.250
Here.

28:13.541 --> 28:16.541
WE'RE SETTING HASSAN FREE. GET READY.

28:52.458 --> 28:53.916
I missed you so much.

29:05.791 --> 29:06.708
Liana…

29:09.291 --> 29:10.916
Liana, I'm so sorry.

29:15.041 --> 29:15.875
What is it?

29:18.458 --> 29:19.583
I'm leaving tomorrow.

29:21.750 --> 29:23.291
We're moving to Canada.

29:31.916 --> 29:33.166
Liana, come on.

29:34.041 --> 29:35.583
So that means you're leaving me?

29:35.666 --> 29:38.333
-That's not what this is about.
-But that's what you're doing.

29:39.708 --> 29:42.458
-You think I'm happy about this?
-You're leaving me. I get it.

29:42.541 --> 29:43.875
Stop saying that.

30:16.125 --> 30:19.708
Saber, it's Thierry. I need
you to come by the office this morning.

30:19.791 --> 30:22.875
With your father being arrested,
I need you to sign a few papers.

30:22.958 --> 30:25.416
I'll be at the office all day.
Stop by any time.

30:40.375 --> 30:41.708
-Saber.
-Hey.

30:41.791 --> 30:42.750
Come in.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.041
Are you alone?

31:27.125 --> 31:29.708
Yes, I told my secretary
to take a few days off.

31:30.208 --> 31:31.625
Where's Virgil at?

31:31.708 --> 31:34.333
He left. Joined another firm, actually.

31:35.791 --> 31:37.166
Was his leaving planned?

31:37.250 --> 31:39.208
No. No more than your father's arrest was

31:39.291 --> 31:41.000
or my two days in custody.

31:41.083 --> 31:41.916
So now what?

31:43.833 --> 31:45.583
It's likely that I'll be disbarred.

31:46.083 --> 31:47.833
-I'm sorry, Thierry.
-For what?

31:49.708 --> 31:50.708
It's not your fault.

31:50.791 --> 31:53.458
I've worked for your father
for 20 years.

31:53.541 --> 31:55.458
I always knew this could happen.

31:56.125 --> 31:58.458
So, here we are. It's happened.

32:07.708 --> 32:08.875
Here they come.

32:19.333 --> 32:20.416
Let's do this.

32:27.708 --> 32:29.166
So, why did you ask me here?

32:30.875 --> 32:33.708
Your father has a few
outstanding transfers that need attention.

32:33.791 --> 32:35.166
I don't have access to my accounts.

32:35.250 --> 32:38.083
Your father had them frozen
just before his arrest.

32:38.166 --> 32:39.208
Let me see what I can do.

32:39.291 --> 32:42.250
In the meantime,
go through and sign these documents, okay?

34:27.083 --> 34:28.833
-Show me your hands!
-Hands!

34:37.750 --> 34:40.375
Open it! Go, go, hurry up!

34:47.041 --> 34:47.958
Come on!

34:53.333 --> 34:55.458
Let's go, stay down!

35:03.500 --> 35:05.291
Put your fucking head down!

35:26.333 --> 35:27.208
Your window!

36:02.708 --> 36:03.625
Please, Saber…

36:03.708 --> 36:04.541
Don't do it, please!

36:05.250 --> 36:08.416
Did my father
put you up to this?

36:08.500 --> 36:09.500
No.

36:09.583 --> 36:10.541
Then who was it?

36:10.625 --> 36:13.875
It was Chris. He left me no choice.

36:13.958 --> 36:16.250
He didn't leave you a choice?
Are you working with him now?

36:16.333 --> 36:19.750
I…I'm sorry, Saber.

36:21.333 --> 36:22.875
And Sofia? Did he put a hit on her?

36:25.125 --> 36:26.083
Tell me!

36:26.166 --> 36:27.500
They're working together.

36:27.583 --> 36:29.791
Sofia cut a deal with Chris.

36:33.041 --> 36:33.916
What do you mean?

36:34.500 --> 36:36.750
She's helping him kill your father.

37:11.208 --> 37:13.000
Sofia set up the meeting here?

37:14.666 --> 37:15.541
Mm.

37:24.208 --> 37:25.541
Liana, come with us.

37:25.625 --> 37:26.708
What do you mean?

37:27.458 --> 37:28.958
Come with us to Montreal.

37:29.916 --> 37:33.166
I'm sorry about everything
with your sister and your niece.

37:33.666 --> 37:35.000
And with the girl as well.

37:36.708 --> 37:37.583
Liana…

37:38.958 --> 37:40.333
isn't it?

37:42.291 --> 37:45.250
You and me.
We wouldn't need to steal cash anymore.

37:45.333 --> 37:46.875
We wouldn't need to hide. We'd be free.

37:49.125 --> 37:50.166
Just come with me.

37:51.791 --> 37:54.875
Many men are capable of killing
for those they love.

37:55.708 --> 37:58.375
But those men like you,

37:59.541 --> 38:01.416
who would risk their own lives,

38:02.708 --> 38:04.458
are much more rare.

38:06.916 --> 38:08.791
-Okay?
-Okay.

38:26.125 --> 38:28.750
I'm gonna talk to my mom
about it. I'll be back.

38:29.333 --> 38:31.083
-I'll wait here.
-Love you.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.166
Is there a problem?

39:04.500 --> 39:06.375
We found one of the men
who stole your coke.

39:06.458 --> 39:08.208
What do we do? He's not alone.

39:09.125 --> 39:11.083
-She's running late.
-She will be here.

39:14.875 --> 39:16.041
Do it.

39:19.916 --> 39:20.750
Kill them all.
