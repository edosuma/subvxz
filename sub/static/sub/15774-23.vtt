00:02.101 --> 00:04.536
- [panting]
what is that?

00:04.538 --> 00:05.837
- That's my new
runner's watch.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.874
It's got everything--
tracks how far you've run,

00:08.876 --> 00:10.142
Your heart rate,
calories burned.

00:10.144 --> 00:13.645
It's got gps to tell you
exactly where you are.

00:13.647 --> 00:14.913
And if I ever lose it,

00:14.915 --> 00:18.183
I can pinpoint exactly
where it is on my cell phone.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.418
Huh?

00:19.420 --> 00:21.920
- [panting]

00:21.922 --> 00:23.688
How far have we gone?

00:23.690 --> 00:25.857
- Uh, 0.04 miles.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.794
- What? We've been
jogging forever.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.930
- We've been jogging
for 20 seconds.

00:31.932 --> 00:34.599
- Does that thing have
a defibrillator?

00:34.601 --> 00:35.667
- No. Why?

00:35.669 --> 00:38.503
- Because I think
my heart just stopped.

00:38.505 --> 00:40.972
No, wait.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.708
There it is.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.778
I think I'm gonna
head home.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.848
No way.
That is too far.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.450
I'd never make it.

00:51.452 --> 00:55.020
Maybe I'll just wait here
till bugs gets back.

00:55.022 --> 00:57.055
He can carry me.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.890
Uhh!

01:24.917 --> 01:27.118
- [chomps]

01:27.120 --> 01:30.655
My lord, porky.
What do you have
in that thing?

01:30.657 --> 01:32.691
- [stammering]
oh, I don't know, just stuff.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.025
Money, credit card receipts,

01:34.027 --> 01:35.927
Business cards,
recipe clippings,

01:35.929 --> 01:37.095
And inspiring articles.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.897
Why, what's in your wallet?

01:38.899 --> 01:40.632
- The essentials.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.634
- Id, credit card,
and some cash?

01:42.636 --> 01:45.871
- No. A lone toothpick.

01:45.873 --> 01:49.508
Because I always get something
right back here,

01:49.510 --> 01:51.710
Right in this area.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.012
What's that?

01:55.147 --> 01:57.749
- Oh, a wedding invitation.

01:57.751 --> 02:00.519
- Ooh, who's becky hogg?

02:00.521 --> 02:03.622
- Just a girl I went
to elementary school with.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.757
- The wedding's tonight.
Are you going?

02:05.759 --> 02:08.026
- No. I mean,
it's out of town.

02:08.027 --> 02:10.895
- Porky, you have to go
to this wedding.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.030
- Why?

02:12.032 --> 02:13.298
- You are obviously in love
with this girl.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.166
- What? Heh heh heh.
No, I'm not.

02:15.168 --> 02:19.004
- Then why have you been
carrying this around
in your wallet?

02:19.006 --> 02:21.606
- I carry everything
in my wallet.

02:21.608 --> 02:23.909
- Porky, you're pining
over her.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.277
- No, I'm not.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.678
- It's destiny.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.014
Becky hogg.
Porky pig.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.816
Hogg, pig.
You're meant to be together.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.151
- No, we're not.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.053
I haven't seen her for years.
And she's getting married.

02:35.055 --> 02:39.157
- Oh, so you're saying
you have no feelings
for this girl?

02:39.159 --> 02:40.926
- Well, I don't know.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.261
We were boyfriend
and girlfriend.

02:43.263 --> 02:43.929
- A-ha!

02:43.931 --> 02:45.697
- But that was third grade.

02:45.699 --> 02:49.701
- Yeah, and you haven't
had a girlfriend since.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.637
Becky has invited you
to her wedding for a reason.

02:52.639 --> 02:55.073
She's obviously never
gotten over you.

02:55.075 --> 02:56.942
Don't you see?

02:56.944 --> 02:57.909
She wants you to stop her

02:57.911 --> 03:00.178
From making the biggest
mistake of her life.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.680
- What are you
talking about?

03:01.682 --> 03:06.751
- She doesn't want to marry
this brian patrick kennedy iv.

03:06.753 --> 03:07.986
He sounds like a loser.

03:07.988 --> 03:10.088
Porky, becky's obviously
the one for you.

03:10.090 --> 03:13.858
This could be your one
and only shot at finding
true love.

03:13.860 --> 03:19.698
- We'll drive.
If we leave now,
we'll be there in 4 hours.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.099
- You'd come with me?

03:21.101 --> 03:23.234
- Porky, you're my friend.

03:23.236 --> 03:24.736
I want you to be happy.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.005
Also, I never pass up
a wedding reception.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.206
The passed apps,
the surf n' turf,

03:28.208 --> 03:30.108
The bubbly, that table
with all those gifts on it

03:30.110 --> 03:32.844
Where you can take whatever
you want as you're leaving.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.245
- Those are wedding presents.

03:34.247 --> 03:36.114
For the bride and groom.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.048
- I don't think so.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.683
At my cousin's wedding,
I got a blender,

03:38.685 --> 03:42.020
A set of china,
and some beautiful linens.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.121
So what do you say, pork,

03:43.123 --> 03:44.990
Are we gonna stop a wedding?

03:44.992 --> 03:47.726
- I can't believe
I'm saying this,

03:47.728 --> 03:49.027
But ok.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.061
Let's do it.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.997
- Mark my words, porky,

03:51.999 --> 03:54.132
You're gonna find true love.

03:54.134 --> 03:57.235
And me, I'm gonna find
something good.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.838
Like a belgian waffle maker.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.740
Or a juicer.
That's it.

04:01.742 --> 04:06.111
Or more linens.
You can never have
too many linens.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.913
[starts engine]

04:08.915 --> 04:10.248
Where are you going?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.116
- The freeway.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.985
- No, I gotta make
a pit stop.

04:17.923 --> 04:21.159
- Does this look like
something you'd wear
to a wedding?

04:21.161 --> 04:23.662
- Yeah, if you're the bride.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.663
- Well, it's all I have.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.264
Do you have anything
I could borrow?

04:26.266 --> 04:29.000
The invitation says
formal attire.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.169
- Then wear a tuxedo.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.871
- Too constricting.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.939
[grunts]

04:36.942 --> 04:39.277
Ooh, can I borrow
your new watch?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.046
It'll make me look important,

04:41.048 --> 04:42.247
Like I have lots of meetings,

04:42.249 --> 04:45.050
Always have to know
what time it is.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.751
- Eh...

04:47.186 --> 04:48.720
- Please?

04:48.722 --> 04:50.088
It's a great way
to meet people.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.190
Someone asks if anyone knows
what time it is,

04:52.192 --> 04:56.294
I say, "I do.
I'm daffy duck.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.698
It's half passed 12:00.
Nice to meet you."

04:59.700 --> 05:00.765
[horn honks]

05:00.767 --> 05:02.934
Ugh, he's so impatient.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.102
We're easily gonna make it.

05:04.104 --> 05:07.205
Come on, please.
I'll take good care of it.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.473
- All right.

05:08.475 --> 05:12.310
For the record,
I think what you two
are doing is idiotic.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.814
But since your idiocy
affords me a glorious weekend

05:15.816 --> 05:17.315
With the house
all to myself,

05:17.317 --> 05:19.317
You have my full blessing.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.853
- Thanks, bugs.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.054
- Ahh.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.990
This is nice.

05:34.133 --> 05:37.168
[sighs]
this is so boring.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.271
I don't know what to do.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.207
- Don't forget to check
your heart rate.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.742
[dance music playing]

05:43.744 --> 05:45.143
[turns tv off]

05:45.145 --> 05:47.912
- [smacks lips]

05:51.183 --> 05:52.250
- What's up?

05:52.252 --> 05:53.151
- You want to hang out?

05:53.153 --> 05:55.120
- Hang out?
I gotta go to work.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.222
Ever heard of it?
How does he do it?

05:57.224 --> 06:00.191
I'd lose my mind if I
just sat around all day
doing nothing.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.862
Hey, man, could you
get the door for me?

06:11.437 --> 06:14.806
- I'll call lola.

06:14.808 --> 06:15.940
[line rings, beep]

06:15.942 --> 06:17.075
- Hi, this is lola.

06:17.077 --> 06:20.812
Wait, that's not true.
I don't have a desk.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.248
And I've never actually
been in a meeting, so.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.150
But I'm probably doing
something interesting,

06:25.152 --> 06:28.853
Like I'm at the hardware store
or I'm saving someone's life.

06:28.855 --> 06:29.854
Or I'm whale watching.

06:29.856 --> 06:32.290
Or maybe I'm being
watched by whales.

06:32.292 --> 06:35.026
Oh, no, maybe I'm--
[beep]

06:41.233 --> 06:43.034
- I'm gonna use
the restroom.

06:43.036 --> 06:46.104
Will you get the gas?

06:50.476 --> 06:52.377
- Ahh!

06:52.379 --> 06:53.444
Ahh!

06:53.446 --> 06:55.213
- Would you mind not eating
in the car?

06:55.215 --> 06:58.850
I just got it washed
and I'm trying to keep it clean.

06:58.852 --> 07:01.886
- Porky, please.
I'm not a child.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.421
I won't get crumbs
everywhere.

07:03.423 --> 07:07.325
Don't worry.

07:09.328 --> 07:11.462
Relax, I'll pick it up.

07:11.464 --> 07:12.964
[sniffs]

07:12.966 --> 07:15.834
Ooh, that's a real strong
sour cream and onion smell.

07:15.836 --> 07:19.270
Uh-oh, a bunch got into
this little crevice.

07:19.272 --> 07:22.373
- Daffy, this is why
I asked you not to eat--

07:22.375 --> 07:24.909
- Don't worry, I think
I can get it.

07:24.911 --> 07:26.244
Let me just put
this up here.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.580
What's the point of
this crevice anyway?

07:28.582 --> 07:31.282
It's a terrible car design.

07:32.151 --> 07:33.117
Ahh!

07:33.119 --> 07:34.919
- My cell phone!

07:34.921 --> 07:36.287
- It's fine.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.456
[beep]

07:38.458 --> 07:43.228
- I told you I didn't want
a mess in the car.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.262
- It's not my fault.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.964
There are no cup holders.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.933
- There's a cup holder
right here.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.401
- Who would put
their cup there?

07:50.403 --> 07:53.271
No, this is where
you want to put your cup.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.173
This car was designed
by idiots.

07:55.175 --> 07:58.042
You got to do more research
before you make big purchases

07:58.044 --> 07:59.410
Like a car, porky.
[ding]

07:59.412 --> 08:00.945
- What the?
- What?

08:00.947 --> 08:02.914
- Why is the gas light on?

08:02.916 --> 08:04.249
I thought you got gas.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.217
- You only gave me
40 bucks, porky.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.386
That barely covers
snacks and magazines.

08:08.388 --> 08:11.155
And this lottery ticket.

08:11.924 --> 08:14.225
Ahh! I don't know
why I play.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.426
- Maybe we should
turn around.

08:15.428 --> 08:18.396
We don't know when there's
gonna be another gas station.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.365
- Porky, we're not
going backwards.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.299
We don't have time.

08:21.301 --> 08:22.467
That light doesn't mean
anything anyway.

08:22.469 --> 08:25.570
You can drive like
200 or 300 miles
with that light.

08:25.572 --> 08:29.007
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.609
[clanging]

08:35.481 --> 08:40.351
You should have given me
more than 40 bucks, pork.

08:47.226 --> 08:50.361
- Ok, come on.
- Where are we going?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.997
- We got to walk back
to the gas station and get gas.

08:52.999 --> 08:55.533
- Shouldn't one of us
wait with the car?

08:55.535 --> 08:56.668
- Why?

08:56.670 --> 08:58.069
- This looks like
a dangerous neighborhood.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.505
Your car will be covered
in graffiti in no time.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.240
- What are you talking about?

09:02.242 --> 09:03.374
This isn't
a bad neighborhood.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.709
We're in the middle
of a desert.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.378
- You've been living in
the suburbs too long, porky.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.648
Come on, one of us needs
to stay here and do nothing.

09:10.650 --> 09:13.284
And the other needs to walk
miles and miles

09:13.286 --> 09:16.955
In 110-degree heat
carrying a heavy can.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.723
And since you did
the hard work of driving

09:18.725 --> 09:22.593
And I was just sitting
next to you in
the passenger's seat

09:22.595 --> 09:23.361
Nodding off,

09:23.363 --> 09:25.396
It would only make sense...

09:25.398 --> 09:27.665
That you continue
the hard work.

09:27.667 --> 09:31.369
You know, just so you don't
feel like a quitter.

09:31.371 --> 09:35.206
- Oh. Uh, ok.

09:37.409 --> 09:39.344
- Pick up the pace, piggy.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.612
We got a wedding to stop.

09:41.614 --> 09:43.247
- Oh, I won.

09:43.249 --> 09:46.551
Strange how it's no more
satisfying than losing.

09:46.553 --> 09:49.520
Ohh, I'm so bored.

09:49.522 --> 09:52.423
I gotta get out
and do something.

09:54.994 --> 09:58.196
Hey, boy, you want
to go for a walk?

09:58.198 --> 10:01.132
- Huh?

10:01.134 --> 10:04.102
Oh. Yuck.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.336
- Aw, come on.

10:05.338 --> 10:06.704
It'll be good for you.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.039
A little exercise.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.208
It'll kill some time.

10:13.445 --> 10:15.513
- How long does it take a pig

10:15.515 --> 10:18.750
To walk 20 miles in
the middle of the desert?

10:18.752 --> 10:19.650
[gasps]

10:19.652 --> 10:21.452
What if he never comes back?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.321
What if he's road kill?

10:23.323 --> 10:24.655
[bird screeches]

10:24.657 --> 10:28.393
[screeches]

10:28.395 --> 10:31.162
[gulps] mother.

10:31.497 --> 10:33.064
My battery's almost dead.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.599
Just enough left
to call bugs for help.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.534
Wait, first I should
quickly text my vote

10:36.536 --> 10:39.504
For last night's
"so you think you can
figure skate."

10:39.506 --> 10:40.505
[beep]

10:40.507 --> 10:42.240
You're welcome, demitri.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.042
Ok, now I can call bugs.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.543
Just got to keep it short.

10:45.545 --> 10:49.380
[phone rings]

10:49.382 --> 10:50.415
Ugh, where is he?

10:50.417 --> 10:54.419
- See, told you
this would be fun.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.591
Hi, this is bugs bunny.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.627
Sorry I'm not available
at the moment,

11:02.629 --> 11:04.762
But please leave your
full name and number

11:04.764 --> 11:06.297
And the reason for your call.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.633
Oh, and the time and date
of your call.

11:08.635 --> 11:10.701
And I will get back to you.
[beep]

11:10.703 --> 11:12.336
- Bugs, it's an emergency.

11:12.338 --> 11:16.374
Oh, sorry. Bugs, hi,
this is daffy duck.

11:16.376 --> 11:20.278
And my number is 555-0123.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.581
And actually I'm calling
for two reasons.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.617
One, don't forget to
text your vote for demitri

11:26.619 --> 11:28.653
To "so you think you can
figure skate,"

11:28.655 --> 11:30.721
Because I'm sick of
the judges falling

11:30.723 --> 11:32.356
For yuvgane's triple axle.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.359
It's all he does.
He's a one-note wonder.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.627
And, uh, what else?

11:36.629 --> 11:39.197
I feel like there was
a second reason I was calling.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.499
[buzzard screeches]

11:41.501 --> 11:42.500
Oh, I remember.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.535
We're stranded in
the middle of the desert.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.604
Porky's wandered off.
He's probably dead.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.539
So get in your car
and come save us.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.342
We're on highway 247
on the shoulder

11:51.344 --> 11:53.611
Next to mile marker 118.

11:53.613 --> 11:57.248
So, highway 247,
mile marker 118.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.316
Please hurry.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.485
Oh, right, you wanted
the time and date.

12:00.487 --> 12:04.522
It's 2:39 pm
on August--[beep]

12:04.524 --> 12:06.491
Ugh, dead battery.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.526
Who designs these phones?

12:08.528 --> 12:09.694
Idiots.

12:09.696 --> 12:13.297
- Fine, you were right.
It wasn't fun.

12:13.299 --> 12:16.300
Why did I want
a weekend to myself?

12:16.302 --> 12:19.837
Ooh, someone called.

12:20.606 --> 12:21.839
[buzzard screeches]

12:21.841 --> 12:25.576
- Maybe this thing has
a game on it or something.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.145
Ahh!

12:27.147 --> 12:29.780
No!

12:29.782 --> 12:33.551
Ugh, now what am I gonna
wear to the wedding?

12:33.553 --> 12:36.387
- [whimpering]

12:38.257 --> 12:39.824
Hey.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.259
- Don't hey me.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.560
I thought you were dead.

12:42.562 --> 12:43.661
What took you so long?

12:43.663 --> 12:47.465
- It was 9 miles each way.

12:48.600 --> 12:52.370
- You really sweat a lot.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.872
- Ok, well,
that took forever.

12:54.874 --> 12:57.275
Come on, we better hurry.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.509
Gah!

12:58.511 --> 13:02.313
- What? I put graffiti on it
so no one else would.

13:03.248 --> 13:07.885
It's called a deterrent, porky.

13:19.531 --> 13:22.233
- Where are they?

13:22.235 --> 13:23.935
[dialing]

13:23.937 --> 13:24.802
[beep]

13:24.804 --> 13:25.770
- This is porky.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.505
So sorry I missed your call.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.906
I promise to--
[beep]

13:28.908 --> 13:31.409
- What's up?
This is double "d."

13:31.411 --> 13:32.610
You know what to do, fool.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.446
- Ugh. Why isn't anyone
picking up their phones?

13:35.448 --> 13:38.916
How am I supposed to find
these nitwits?

13:39.618 --> 13:41.252
My new watch.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.653
There's gps on the watch.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.723
I can find out exactly
where they are.

13:45.725 --> 13:49.327
[beeping]

13:49.695 --> 13:52.430
What are they doing
off the highway?

13:52.432 --> 13:55.633
Well, it's better
than being at home.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.236
[whistling]

14:00.305 --> 14:02.873
[phone beeping]

14:06.011 --> 14:08.713
[dinging]

14:08.715 --> 14:10.881
Huh?

14:10.883 --> 14:13.351
[buzzard screeches]

14:13.353 --> 14:15.720
[gulps]

14:16.622 --> 14:17.622
[phone vibrates and chimes]

14:17.624 --> 14:19.657
- Oh, good,
my phone is charged.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.727
Ah, I should send
a quick text to bugs.

14:22.729 --> 14:23.828
[ding]

14:23.830 --> 14:26.597
- "disregard earlier message.
We're fine.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.367
Back on the road.
No need to come get us."

14:29.369 --> 14:31.502
You've got to be kidding me.
[beep]

14:31.504 --> 14:36.340
Also, a buzzard
stole your watch.

14:36.675 --> 14:37.742
[buzzard screeches]

14:37.744 --> 14:41.512
That's nice.

14:46.418 --> 14:48.786
- Where's the highway?
Where is it?

14:48.788 --> 14:50.655
How can I lose a highway?

14:50.657 --> 14:53.457
Oh, I know how
I lost a highway.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.493
Because I was looking
at my phone,

14:55.495 --> 14:57.662
Trying to find a watch
and two nincompoops

14:57.664 --> 15:01.365
Instead of paying attention
to my surroundings.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.667
[voice echoing]

15:02.669 --> 15:06.871
Eh, still better
than being at home.

15:09.641 --> 15:13.778
- Phew, we made it.
And with time to spare.

15:13.780 --> 15:15.813
- Heh. Bugs is so lame.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.081
He doesn't return texts.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.416
And I've sent him good ones.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.819
Look. "we be drivin'.
Where you at?"

15:21.821 --> 15:23.487
Nothing.
- Can I help you?

15:23.489 --> 15:25.890
- We're here for
the kennedy-hogg wedding.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.925
- Ah, yes, that'll be
in ballroom "b"

15:27.927 --> 15:29.927
In the west tower
of the hotel.

15:29.929 --> 15:30.895
- Great. Thanks.

15:30.897 --> 15:31.996
- Where are you going?

15:31.998 --> 15:33.497
- Ballroom "b."

15:33.499 --> 15:35.800
- Looking like that?

15:35.802 --> 15:37.768
We'd like a room.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.737
- Daffy, there isn't time.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.739
- Porky, look at yourself.

15:41.741 --> 15:44.375
Becky hogg's not gonna
call off her wedding

15:44.377 --> 15:46.377
For a filthy pig.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.512
You've come too far
to blow it now.

15:48.514 --> 15:50.715
- [sighs]
maybe you're right.

15:50.717 --> 15:51.916
- Of course I'm right.

15:51.918 --> 15:53.684
Give me your credit card.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.820
- Here you go,
one standard room.

15:55.822 --> 15:57.355
- Standard?

15:57.357 --> 15:59.990
Go grab us an elevator.

15:59.992 --> 16:04.662
Why don't you bump us up
to the penthouse.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.831
- Excuse me.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.566
I hate to bother you,

16:08.568 --> 16:12.103
But can you tell me
where the highway is?

16:12.105 --> 16:13.771
Hello?

16:13.773 --> 16:15.406
Hello?

16:15.408 --> 16:18.709
Well, fine,
be that way.

16:18.711 --> 16:21.712
Where are you going?

16:23.382 --> 16:26.650
The highway?
Can I go with you?

16:26.652 --> 16:28.586
Where you going?

16:28.588 --> 16:30.755
Well, wait for me!

16:30.757 --> 16:32.890
Uhh!

16:33.725 --> 16:38.028
Maybe I'll just take
a little nap.

16:38.030 --> 16:40.765
[wolves howling]

16:41.700 --> 16:45.603
- I still can't believe
this is a standard room.

16:45.605 --> 16:46.804
It's so nice.

16:46.806 --> 16:47.838
How do I look?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.707
- Like a pig in a tuxedo.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.576
So not great.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.649
- [sighs] what if this
isn't my destiny?

16:58.651 --> 16:59.817
- It is.

16:59.819 --> 17:02.953
Porky, you and becky
are meant to be together.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.855
It's undeniable.

17:04.857 --> 17:05.856
I mean, come on.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.125
You already have
the same last name.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.428
- Her last name is hogg.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.162
- Hogg, pig.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.530
What's the difference?

17:12.531 --> 17:14.865
The universe is doing
everything it can

17:14.867 --> 17:16.200
To bring you two together.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.637
You've got to do
the rest, porky.

17:19.638 --> 17:20.771
- Ok.

17:20.772 --> 17:21.972
Let's do it.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.074
Oh, my, it's about to start.

17:24.076 --> 17:27.811
- Wait. First I have to
figure out what I'm gonna wear.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.781
I was really counting
on that watch.

17:30.783 --> 17:31.916
[ding]

17:31.918 --> 17:34.485
- You're really gonna wear
a hotel bathrobe?

17:34.487 --> 17:35.686
- It makes me look relaxed,

17:35.688 --> 17:37.488
Like I soaked in the tub
for an hour.

17:37.490 --> 17:40.791
- You did soak in the tub
for an hour.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.626
- They have a spa?

17:42.628 --> 17:43.894
One quick massage.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.931
- Daffy, there's no time.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.100
We're here.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.502
- You can do it.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.104
Your future is on
the other side of these doors.

17:54.106 --> 17:55.739
- I don't know.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.475
I think I'm too nervous.

17:57.477 --> 18:00.611
- Look, I'm not letting you
leave here

18:00.613 --> 18:03.147
Without the woman
of your dreams.

18:03.149 --> 18:06.550
Stop the wedding!

18:06.552 --> 18:08.018
[all gasping]

18:08.020 --> 18:10.020
You don't love him,

18:10.022 --> 18:11.956
You love porky.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.892
And porky loves you.

18:14.894 --> 18:15.893
- Huh?

18:15.895 --> 18:19.063
- That's not becky.

18:19.731 --> 18:23.567
- You may now kiss
the bride.

18:25.203 --> 18:26.871
- Ladies and gentlemen,

18:26.873 --> 18:31.141
Mr. And mrs. Brian patrick
kennedy iv.

18:31.143 --> 18:34.245
[applause]

18:34.779 --> 18:35.713
- Hi, porky.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.882
See you at the reception.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.985
- Probably should have paid
closer attention

18:40.987 --> 18:43.554
To the time, porky.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.590
All those stops.

18:46.592 --> 18:49.059
[music playing]

18:51.630 --> 18:52.763
- They look happy.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.599
I can't believe we were
gonna stop their wedding.

18:55.601 --> 18:58.636
- I can't believe
becky hogg isn't a pig.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.236
- [sighs]

18:59.238 --> 19:00.838
Well, even thought
it turns out

19:00.840 --> 19:02.940
Becky and I weren't
destined for each other,

19:02.942 --> 19:06.310
I still appreciate what
you tried to do for me, daffy.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.811
You're a good friend.

19:07.813 --> 19:11.215
- The love of your life
is out there somewhere, porky.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.884
And I promise you
we'll find her.

19:13.886 --> 19:17.321
I don't care how many farms
we have to go to,

19:17.323 --> 19:19.623
We will dig through
that slop,

19:19.625 --> 19:21.892
And we will find you
a female pig.

19:21.894 --> 19:24.662
- She doesn't have to be
a pig, you know.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.297
I mean, you have this
big theory

19:26.299 --> 19:27.765
That just because I'm a pig,

19:27.767 --> 19:29.934
I'm automatically gonna
fall in love

19:29.936 --> 19:33.671
With the first pig that I...

19:43.882 --> 19:47.084
- I did say mark my words.

19:47.086 --> 19:49.587
[gasps]

19:56.161 --> 19:59.697
Ohh! A bread maker!

20:08.807 --> 20:12.242
- Any way you could point me
toward the highway?

20:12.244 --> 20:14.311
[clanging]

20:21.286 --> 20:23.754
- Beep beep!

20:32.197 --> 20:34.965
[accordion playing]

20:38.670 --> 20:44.274
- Uh, any way you could
point me toward the highway?

20:45.110 --> 20:47.745
Thanks.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.016
Hmm.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.718
It beats walking.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.221
- Aw, I miss you, too,
petunia.

20:57.223 --> 20:59.857
I can't believe we met
just yesterday.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.893
It feels like I've
known you forever.

21:02.895 --> 21:03.994
Ha ha ha!

21:03.996 --> 21:07.831
Ok, well, I'll call you
when we get home.

21:07.833 --> 21:10.367
You hang up first.

21:10.369 --> 21:12.202
No, you hang up.

21:12.204 --> 21:14.004
No, you hang up.
- Ugh.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.406
- Heh. No, you.
