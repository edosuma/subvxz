WEBVTT

00:05.756 --> 00:08.884
HOW COME I CAN

00:05.756 --> 00:08.884
NEVER FIND ANYTHING?

00:08.926 --> 00:10.218
BECAUSE YOU'RE A SLOB, JUNE.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.346
(sighs) BECAUSE YOU

00:10.260 --> 00:12.346
ARE A DISORGANIZED...

00:12.387 --> 00:14.055
OOH! DUMPLING.

00:14.097 --> 00:17.100
(thud in distance)

00:17.142 --> 00:18.811
CHLOE?

00:21.146 --> 00:22.690
(clatter)

00:22.731 --> 00:23.899
(whispers) CHLOE?

00:23.941 --> 00:25.066
(clatter)

00:25.108 --> 00:27.068
(floorboard creaks)

00:25.108 --> 00:27.068
CHLOE?

00:27.110 --> 00:29.363
WHAT?!

00:29.404 --> 00:30.656
(whispers) I HEARD SOMETHING.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.074
YEAH! YOU SCREAMING

00:30.698 --> 00:33.074
"CHLOE! CHLOE!"

00:33.116 --> 00:34.242
AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS!

00:34.284 --> 00:36.286
(clatter)

00:34.284 --> 00:36.286
(both gasp)

00:36.328 --> 00:37.538
WHAT WAS THAT?

00:38.580 --> 00:39.456
SURPRISE!

00:39.498 --> 00:40.541
AAH!

00:40.582 --> 00:41.709
NUTS! NOSE! NUTS! NOSE!

00:41.750 --> 00:42.960
TEDDY!

00:43.002 --> 00:45.086
IT WAS ME. I WAS THE NOISE

00:43.002 --> 00:45.086
SHE WAS HEARING.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.129
(laughs)

00:46.171 --> 00:47.297
(panting) WHO IS TEDDY,

00:47.339 --> 00:49.132
AND W-WHAT IS THIS ROOM

00:47.339 --> 00:49.132
THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE?

00:49.174 --> 00:50.091
OH, THAT'S OUR THIRD BEDROOM.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.677
I USE IT AS MY CLOSET.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.929
AND TEDDY AND I WENT TO

00:51.719 --> 00:53.929
PSYCHOPATH CAMP TOGETHER

00:53.971 --> 00:55.931
WHEN WE WERE KIDS!

00:55.973 --> 00:57.558
JUNE, I DIDN'T TELL YOU

00:55.973 --> 00:57.558
ABOUT THE CLOSET,

00:57.599 --> 00:59.768
AND THAT'S A BIG THING

00:57.599 --> 00:59.768
TO KEEP FROM SOMEBODY.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.020
I'M SORRY.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.103
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU!

01:02.145 --> 01:03.146
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU

01:02.145 --> 01:03.146

I KEEP MY SUITS IN A TRASH BAG

01:18.871 --> 01:22.165
ON THE FIRE ESCAPE.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.125
CAMP C.U.T.S.--

01:24.167 --> 01:27.128
IT STANDS FOR "CALLOUS

01:24.167 --> 01:27.128

01:27.170 --> 01:28.129
YOU KEPT THE SHIRT?

01:28.171 --> 01:29.130
OF COURSE I KEPT THE SHIRT.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.131
I LOVED IT THERE.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.341
SHOULD WE SING HER

01:30.173 --> 01:31.341
THE CAMP SONG?

01:31.383 --> 01:34.302
(Chloe and Teddy whistle tune)

01:34.344 --> 01:35.763
(both, monotone voice)

01:34.344 --> 01:35.763
WE ARE NORMAL CHILDREN.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.305
WE DON'T TORTURE ANIMALS.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.850
RESPECT YOUR THERAPIST.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.850
TAKE YOUR MEDS.

01:39.892 --> 01:41.727
OUR PAIN IS HOPEFULLY FINITE.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.520
MY MOM SENT ME

01:41.769 --> 01:43.520
TO CAMP C.U.T.S.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.606
BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT I HAD

01:43.562 --> 01:45.606
TROUBLE EXPRESSING ANY EMOTION.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.315
I HAD NO REACTION TO THAT.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.150
AND MY MOM SENT ME BECAUSE OF

01:47.357 --> 01:49.150
WHAT I DID TO MY BROTHER.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.569
WHAT'D YOU DO

01:49.192 --> 01:50.569
TO YOUR BROTHER?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.863
SO EVERY YEAR,

01:50.611 --> 01:52.863
TEDDY GOES OFF HIS MEDS,

01:52.905 --> 01:55.407
AND HE COMES TO TOWN FOR

01:52.905 --> 01:55.407

01:57.993 --> 02:00.245

02:04.207 --> 02:05.166
PREPARING FOR BATTLE,

02:05.208 --> 02:06.167
SHARPENING THEIR FINGERNAILS?

02:06.209 --> 02:08.879
(high-pitched voice)

02:06.209 --> 02:08.879
SHING-SHING. SHING.

02:08.921 --> 02:11.757
THIS IS THE DRESS

02:08.921 --> 02:11.757
THAT I WANT.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.760
RETAIL VALUE IS $4,000.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.261
THEY'LL MARK IT DOWN

02:14.802 --> 02:16.261
TO $399.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.180
THEY'LL ONLY HAVE ONE,

02:16.303 --> 02:19.180
AND THEY'LL HIDE IT...

02:19.222 --> 02:20.348
BUT I'LL FIND IT.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.558
WHAT DOES TEDDY DO?

02:21.600 --> 02:23.226
HE CLEARS A PATH

02:21.600 --> 02:23.226
AND ERECTS A FORCE FIELD.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.186
I'M TOUGH, JUNE,

02:23.268 --> 02:25.186
BUT I NEED A WARRIOR--

02:25.228 --> 02:26.229
SOMEONE WITH NO FEAR.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.272
YOU WERE THE FEARLESS ONE.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.274
YOU PUSHED MISS WU

02:27.314 --> 02:29.274
OUT OF THE ICE CREAM TRUCK

02:29.316 --> 02:30.776
AND THREW US ALL BOMB POPS.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.903
WU WAS SLOW.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.903
SHE HAD TO BE PUSHED. (laughs)

02:30.818 --> 02:32.903
(laughs)

02:32.945 --> 02:35.196
THAT CAMP WAS THE BEST.

02:32.945 --> 02:35.196
IT'S SO SAD THAT IT'S GONE.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.197
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?

02:36.239 --> 02:38.408
IT BURNED DOWN.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.408
CLOSED.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.369
(horn honks in distance)

02:41.411 --> 02:43.580
(Chloe laughs)

02:43.622 --> 02:47.126
AND SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?

02:43.622 --> 02:47.126
HOW MANY GUYS IN YOUR ROTATION?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.251
SEVEN.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.461
(singsongy)

02:48.293 --> 02:49.461
BUT SHE ONLY LOVES ONE!

02:49.503 --> 02:50.921
JUNE, SHUT UP!

02:50.963 --> 02:53.465
SHE  DOES?  WHO IS HE?

02:50.963 --> 02:53.465
HIS NAME IS BENJAMIN.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.300
HE DIRECTED A WONDERFUL MOVIE

02:53.507 --> 02:55.300
THAT JAMES WAS IN

02:55.342 --> 02:57.094
CALLED "LOVE MONSTER."

02:57.136 --> 02:59.262
NEVER HEARD OF IT!

02:57.136 --> 02:59.262
THEY MET ON HALLOWEEN,

02:59.304 --> 03:01.306
AND SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS

02:59.304 --> 03:01.306
PLAYING A TRICK ON HIM,

03:01.348 --> 03:02.683
BUT IT TURNED OUT HE WAS

03:01.348 --> 03:02.683
PLAYING A TRICK ON HER,

03:02.724 --> 03:05.102
AND THEY HAD A ROMANTIC SCENE

03:02.724 --> 03:05.102
AT THE AIRPORT

03:05.144 --> 03:07.312
AND THEY HAVEN'T TALKED

03:05.144 --> 03:07.312
TO EACH OTHER SINCE.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.898
EXCUSE ME. WHAT IS GOING ON

03:07.354 --> 03:09.898
UNDER YOUR TOP?

03:09.940 --> 03:12.067
IT'S A, UH,

03:09.940 --> 03:12.067
IT'S A BATHING SUIT.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.318
AAH! DEVIL!

03:13.360 --> 03:14.611
WHAT? IT'S BEEN REALLY CRAZY

03:13.360 --> 03:14.611
AT WORK,

03:14.653 --> 03:16.488
AND I HAVEN'T HAD TIME

03:14.653 --> 03:16.488
TO DO LAUNDRY.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.239
JUNE, IF YOU WANNA COME WITH US

03:16.530 --> 03:18.239
TO THE WAREHOUSE SALE,

03:18.281 --> 03:20.241
I'D BE HAPPY

03:18.281 --> 03:20.241
TO BLOCK FOR YOU, TOO.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.326
THAT'S VERY SWEET, TEDDY,

03:21.368 --> 03:24.245
BUT I DON'T NEED

03:21.368 --> 03:24.245
ANY NEW FANCY UNDERWEAR.

03:24.287 --> 03:27.248
JUNE, YOU DESERVE

03:24.287 --> 03:27.248
THAT URINARY TRACT INFECTION

03:27.290 --> 03:29.292
THAT BATHING SUIT'S

03:27.290 --> 03:29.292
GIVING YOU.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.257
OKAY, WHEN YOU SAID WE WERE

03:33.296 --> 03:36.257
GETTING A V.I.P. WALK-THROUGH,

03:36.299 --> 03:37.718
I PICTURED

03:36.299 --> 03:37.718
THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF THIS.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.179
YOU CAN'T GO TO WAR IF YOU DON'T

03:37.759 --> 03:40.179
KNOW THE BATTLEFIELD, JAMES.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.471
(sighs) THE ONLY GOOD THING

03:40.220 --> 03:41.471
ABOUT THIS SALE

03:41.513 --> 03:44.265
IS THE XANADU IT CREATES

03:41.513 --> 03:44.265
AT THE FLAGSHIP STORE.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.266
WHILE YOU GUYS ARE HERE

03:44.307 --> 03:45.266
BATTLING IT OUT,

03:45.308 --> 03:48.145
I WILL BE UPTOWN

03:45.308 --> 03:48.145
SHOPPING IN PEACE.

03:48.187 --> 03:49.270
I'LL EVEN CHECK IN ON HOW

03:48.187 --> 03:49.270
THE BEEK JEANS ARE SELLING.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.313

04:12.169 --> 04:14.295
THEY'LL STASH IT.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.296

04:15.338 --> 04:16.590
I'M GONNA GO FLATTEN

04:15.338 --> 04:16.590
THEIR TIRES.

04:18.508 --> 04:19.968
SO, JAMES,

04:18.508 --> 04:19.968
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

04:20.010 --> 04:22.804
UH, I PASSED ON A CHEMISTRY READ

04:20.010 --> 04:22.804
WITH HELEN HUNT

04:22.846 --> 04:24.305
FOR SOME TV PILOT.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.307
UH-HUH. WHAT ELSE?

04:26.349 --> 04:28.685
(sighs) MY SECOND COUSIN JANET

04:26.349 --> 04:28.685
IS IN LOVE WITH ME.

04:28.727 --> 04:31.188
HER HUGS REMAIN

04:28.727 --> 04:31.188
WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.356
UH-HUH. WHAT ELSE?

04:33.398 --> 04:35.901
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK ME?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.569
ASK YOU WHAT?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.320
HOW BENJAMIN'S DOING.

04:39.362 --> 04:40.530

04:41.782 --> 04:42.950
YOU HAVEN'T TALKED

04:41.782 --> 04:42.950
SINCE HALLOWEEN.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.325
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALL HIM?

04:44.367 --> 04:46.620
AND BE THE FIRST ONE TO MAKE

04:44.367 --> 04:46.620
THE SECOND MOVE? NO WAY.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.039
CHLOE, YOU LIKE THIS GUY.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.039
STOP PLAYING GAMES.

04:49.081 --> 04:51.125
HE'S OUT OF TOWN, BUT I'M SURE

04:49.081 --> 04:51.125
HE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR--

04:51.166 --> 04:52.834
PRACTICE DRILL!

04:51.166 --> 04:52.834
OH!

04:52.876 --> 04:54.253
DAMN IT, JAMES!

04:54.294 --> 04:56.588
STOP DISTRACTING ME WITH

04:54.294 --> 04:56.588
YOUR WEIRD BENJAMIN OBSESSION!

04:56.630 --> 04:58.173
I HAVE TO FOCUS!

04:58.215 --> 05:00.425
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT WEEK

04:58.215 --> 05:00.425
OF MY LIFE.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.843
JOHN GOODMAN?!

05:01.885 --> 05:04.179
IS JOHN GOODMAN

05:01.885 --> 05:04.179
AT THE V.I.P. WALK-THROUGH?

05:04.221 --> 05:06.848
OH! NO, THAT'S JUST HEATHER.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.349
IT'S JUST HEATHER, EVERYONE!

05:08.391 --> 05:10.560
NO AUTOGRAPHS.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.560
DON'T RUN UP TO HER WITH A PEN.

05:10.602 --> 05:13.230
THIS PERSON WAS NOT

05:10.602 --> 05:13.230
ON "ROSEANNE."

05:13.272 --> 05:14.648
(laughs)

05:14.689 --> 05:16.191
(horn honks in distance)

05:16.233 --> 05:18.610
BE RIGHT BACK!

05:16.233 --> 05:18.610
GOTTA USE THE LADIES'!

05:20.445 --> 05:21.362

05:21.404 --> 05:24.324
(sighs) FRICKIN' BATHING SUIT.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.370
I  DO NOT  HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

05:29.412 --> 05:32.874
(alarm ringing)

05:29.412 --> 05:32.874
DAMN IT!

05:34.084 --> 05:37.254
I'M IN.

05:34.084 --> 05:37.254
I WANNA GO TO THAT SALE.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.380
YAY! OKAY, JUST REMEMBER--

05:39.422 --> 05:41.382
HAIR IN A BUN,

05:39.422 --> 05:41.382
NO LOOSE CLOTHING.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.717
WHY?

05:44.469 --> 05:46.221
ACCESS POINT! ACCESS POINT!

05:44.469 --> 05:46.221
ACCESS POINT!

05:46.263 --> 05:48.890
OW! YOU DIDN'T KNOW

05:46.263 --> 05:48.890
THOSE WERE CLIP-ONS!

05:48.932 --> 05:50.184
ACCESS POINT!

05:48.932 --> 05:50.184
OW!

05:50.225 --> 05:51.392
ACCESS POINT! ACCESS POINT!

05:50.225 --> 05:51.392
I GET IT!

05:51.434 --> 05:52.477
(knock on door)

05:53.520 --> 05:55.647
(door creaks)

05:55.689 --> 05:56.940
SURPRISE.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.068
(James) BENJAMIN!

06:00.110 --> 06:03.197
(door closes)

06:00.110 --> 06:03.197
YOU CAME TO SEE ME.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.032
THAT MEANS YOU MADE

06:03.238 --> 06:05.032
THE FIRST SECOND MOVE.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.617
UH, NO. SORRY,

06:05.073 --> 06:07.617
I'M NOT HERE TO SEE YOU.

06:07.659 --> 06:10.411
I'M HERE TO SURPRISE JIMBO WITH

06:07.659 --> 06:10.411
A GIFT I BOUGHT HIM IN ITALY.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.412
YOU GOT ME A PRESENT?

06:11.454 --> 06:13.832
BUT YOU THINKING I MADE

06:11.454 --> 06:13.832
THE FIRST SECOND MOVE

06:13.874 --> 06:17.418
IS ACTUALLY  YOU  MAKING

06:13.874 --> 06:17.418
THE FIRST SECOND MOVE.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.879
UH, WHAT?

06:18.920 --> 06:20.130
NO, I--

06:20.172 --> 06:22.465
BENJAMIN, TEDDY.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.465
TEDDY, BENJAMIN. (chuckles)

06:22.507 --> 06:24.301
CHLOE AND I WENT TO--

06:22.507 --> 06:24.301
HE'S JUNE'S BOYFRIEND!

06:24.343 --> 06:25.886
HE WAS--HE WAS GONNA SAY,

06:25.927 --> 06:29.723
"CHLOE AND I WENT...

06:25.927 --> 06:29.723
TO JUNE'S BOYFRIEND."

06:31.474 --> 06:33.392
HONK HONK! HONK HONK!

06:35.687 --> 06:36.688
RELAX, HONEY.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.731
(door slams)

06:41.943 --> 06:43.362
(lowered voice) OKAY.

06:43.402 --> 06:45.488
JUNE, I NEED YOU TO PRETEND

06:43.402 --> 06:45.488
TO DATE TEDDY.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.157
IF BENJAMIN KNOWS

06:45.530 --> 06:47.157
TOO MUCH ABOUT ME,

06:47.199 --> 06:49.034
HE'LL JUST USE IT AGAINST ME

06:47.199 --> 06:49.034
AS AMMUNITION--

06:49.076 --> 06:50.493
THE SAME WAY YOU TOLD ME

06:49.076 --> 06:50.493
YOU USED TO WET THE BED,

06:50.535 --> 06:52.620
AND NOW I REFER TO YOU

06:50.535 --> 06:52.620
AS "PEE DRAGON."

06:52.662 --> 06:55.540
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO PRETEND-DATE

06:52.662 --> 06:55.540
YOUR MENTALLY UNSTABLE FRIEND

06:55.582 --> 06:57.292
WHO IS CURRENTLY

06:55.582 --> 06:57.292
OFF HIS MEDS.

06:57.334 --> 07:00.545
COME ON! JUNE, IT'S TEDDY.

06:57.334 --> 07:00.545
HE'S FINE.

07:03.422 --> 07:04.674
I'M COMING FOR YOU, ELI.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.467
BRING IT, TEDDY.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.178
SEE? ELI LOVES HIM.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.305
PLEASE, JUNE? PLEASE? PLEASE?

07:08.220 --> 07:10.305
PLEASE? PLEASE? PLEASE? PLEASE?

07:10.347 --> 07:12.557
WELL, SINCE YOU'RE BASICALLY

07:10.347 --> 07:12.557
ADMITTING THAT I'M RIGHT

07:12.599 --> 07:15.435
AND YOU LOVE BENJAMIN

07:12.599 --> 07:15.435
AS MUCH AS I WANT YOU TO, I--

07:12.599 --> 07:15.435
TEDDY!

07:17.520 --> 07:18.563
YOU HAVE TO PRETEND TO DATE

07:17.520 --> 07:18.563
PEE DRAGON.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.940
CAN I WEAR A MASK?

07:19.981 --> 07:21.233
NO.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.233
I'M IN.

07:23.318 --> 07:24.403
NO.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.696
HEY.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.696
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

07:26.738 --> 07:28.365
UH, WE W-WE WERE JUST,

07:26.738 --> 07:28.365
UH...

07:28.407 --> 07:29.950
WE'RE BOOB-FEELING.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.576
LET'S ALL GO ON A DOUBLE DATE.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.994
(mouths words)

07:31.618 --> 07:32.994
CHLOE,

07:33.036 --> 07:35.414
YOUR FRIEND JUST SUGGESTED

07:33.036 --> 07:35.414
A DOUBLE DATE...

07:35.455 --> 07:36.957
(chuckles)

07:35.455 --> 07:36.957
YOUR FRIEND

07:35.455 --> 07:36.957
YOU'VE BEEN WHISPERING WITH

07:36.998 --> 07:39.876
HERE IN THE KITCHEN.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.876
YOU WANNA GO OUT WITH ME.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.503
NO, I DON'T. I ACTUALLY

07:39.918 --> 07:42.503
DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.132
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA NOT GO

07:42.545 --> 07:45.132
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT ME TO.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.551
WELL,  I'M  NOT GOING TO NOT GO

07:45.173 --> 07:48.551
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT ME TO.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.011
JUNE, WHERE ARE WE GOING?

07:50.053 --> 07:51.512
I--

07:50.053 --> 07:51.512
NO, DON'T TELL THEM YET.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.556
W--

07:51.554 --> 07:53.556
DON'T TELL THEM YET. NO.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.475
(horn honks)

07:57.477 --> 07:58.561
(James) HOW ABOUT THIS?

07:58.603 --> 08:00.563
THAT LITTLE MOVIE'S

07:58.603 --> 08:00.563
TAKEN OVER THE WORLD, HUH?

08:00.605 --> 08:02.690
YEP.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.690
(sighs deeply)

08:02.732 --> 08:05.735
I THINK I'M STILL PICKING

08:02.732 --> 08:05.735
PINK FUR OUT OF MY TEETH.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.239
SO... JIMMY JIMBO...

08:09.281 --> 08:10.991
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

08:11.032 --> 08:13.534
I, UH, JUST GOT

08:11.032 --> 08:13.534
A NEW BIDET INSTALLED.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.162
UH-HUH. WHAT ELSE?

08:13.576 --> 08:15.162
YEAH.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.704
I HAD A CRAZY FIGHT WITH

08:15.203 --> 08:16.704
MY MAIL LADY THE OTHER DAY.

08:16.746 --> 08:17.998
UH-HUH. WHAT ELSE?

08:18.039 --> 08:20.167
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK ME?

08:20.208 --> 08:22.461
ASK YOU WHAT?

08:22.502 --> 08:23.920
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CHLOE.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.630
(exhales deeply)

08:23.962 --> 08:25.630
I'M TIRED OF BEING

08:23.962 --> 08:25.630
IN THE MIDDLE

08:25.672 --> 08:27.048
OF YOUR GUYS' RELATIONSHIP.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.217
(chuckles) W-WHAT?

08:27.090 --> 08:29.217
W-WE'RE NOT IN A RELATIONSHIP.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.593
COME ON, STOP THE GAMES.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.593
(pours liquid)

08:30.635 --> 08:32.720
LISTEN, CHLOE'S NOT GOOD

08:30.635 --> 08:32.720
AT MAKING THE FIRST MOVE,

08:32.762 --> 08:35.432
ESPECIALLY IF IT'S

08:32.762 --> 08:35.432
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

08:35.474 --> 08:38.559
BUT JUST CUT THE NONSENSE,

08:35.474 --> 08:38.559
AND SHE WILL, TOO.

08:38.601 --> 08:39.644
I PROMISE YOU.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.605
YOU MEAN, JUST... (sighs)

08:42.647 --> 08:43.940
BE REAL?

08:43.982 --> 08:45.566
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CRAZY,

08:43.982 --> 08:45.566
BUT IT WORKS.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.568
IT'S LIKE IN THE MOVIE,

08:47.610 --> 08:49.570
WHEN I HAD TO LOOK PAST

08:47.610 --> 08:49.570
ALL THE MONSTER STEREOTYPES

08:49.612 --> 08:51.531
AND JUST SEE PLINKO

08:49.612 --> 08:51.531
FOR PLINKO.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.578
YOU'RE AN INTUITIVE ACTOR

08:55.535 --> 08:57.578
AND AN INCREDIBLE FRIEND.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.580
THANK YOU.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.666
ANY TIME.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.666
(clink)

09:03.793 --> 09:05.379
(indistinct conversations)

09:05.420 --> 09:08.589
OF COURSE HE'S LATE.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.589
IT'S A POWER MOVE.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.676
AND I'M SITTING HERE WITH

09:08.631 --> 09:11.676
MY HAND UP MY DRESS LIKE A JERK.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.803
WHY ARE WE HERE SO EARLY?

09:11.718 --> 09:13.803
IT'S ONLY 5:00.

09:13.845 --> 09:16.306
I'M NOT HUNGRY YET.

09:13.845 --> 09:16.306
I STILL FEEL LUNCH.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.682
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO TO BED

09:16.348 --> 09:17.682
AT 8:30.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.601
WE NEED TO BE AT THE WAREHOUSE

09:17.724 --> 09:20.601
AT 6:00 A.M. SHARP.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.480
WHERE'S TEDDY?

09:23.522 --> 09:24.647
THIS IS OURS.

09:23.522 --> 09:24.647
WE WERE SEATED FIRST,

09:24.689 --> 09:28.276
BUT YOU GOT BREAD FIRST,

09:24.689 --> 09:28.276
AND THAT'S NOT FAIR.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.652
(dish clatters)

09:31.863 --> 09:33.198
I LOVE YOU.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.699
OH. OKAY. OKAY.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.701
(chuckles)

09:34.741 --> 09:36.701
THANK YOU.

09:36.743 --> 09:37.869
(silverware clatters)

09:37.911 --> 09:39.120
WELL PLAYED.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.789
SHOWING UP LATE,

09:39.162 --> 09:41.789
ESTABLISHING YOUR DOMINANCE.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.791
NO MORE GAMES, CHLOE.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.791
I CAME BY YOUR APARTMENT

09:43.833 --> 09:47.504
BECAUSE I WANTED TO

09:43.833 --> 09:47.504
SURPRISE  YOU,  NOT JAMES.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.714
ACTUALLY... (chuckles) I BLEW

09:47.546 --> 09:49.714
OFF BIG MEETING I HAD IN L.A.

09:49.756 --> 09:52.675
BECAUSE I WANTED TO COME HERE

09:49.756 --> 09:52.675
AND SEE YOU

09:52.717 --> 09:54.094
BECAUSE I MISSED YOU.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.889
(lowered voice)

09:56.096 --> 09:57.889
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

09:57.931 --> 10:00.683
(lowered voice) I-I THINK

09:57.931 --> 10:00.683
HE'S JUST BEING HONEST WITH YOU.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.727
(groans)

10:02.769 --> 10:04.645
MAYBE YOU CAN--

10:02.769 --> 10:04.645
YOU CAN DO THE SAME?

10:05.730 --> 10:07.524
(whispers) OH.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.032
I'M HAVING AN AFFAIR

10:14.406 --> 10:16.032
WITH TEDDY.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.909
(Benjamin, June, and Teddy)

10:16.074 --> 10:17.909
WHAT?

10:17.951 --> 10:19.660
JUNE, I'M REALLY SORRY

10:17.951 --> 10:19.660
YOU HAD TO FIND OUT THIS WAY.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.705
IF YOU NEED TO HAVE AN UGLY CRY,

10:19.702 --> 10:22.705
THERE'S A COUCH IN THE BATHROOM.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.666
UH, CHLOE, I WAS JUST

10:22.747 --> 10:25.666
TOTALLY HONEST WITH YOU,

10:25.708 --> 10:27.294
SO I DON'T GET--

10:27.335 --> 10:28.711
WHAT DON'T YOU GET?

10:28.753 --> 10:31.047
I'M HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH TEDDY,

10:28.753 --> 10:31.047
AND JUNE'S ABOUT TO UGLY CRY.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.674
COME ON, JUNE,

10:31.089 --> 10:33.674
GIVE THEM A LITTLE PREVIEW.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.676
IT'S LIKE... (imitates sobbing)

10:35.718 --> 10:37.887
I CAN'T DO IT

10:35.718 --> 10:37.887
BECAUSE I'M TOO CUTE.

10:37.929 --> 10:40.098
TEDDY, LET'S GO.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.933
(horn honks in distance)

10:49.107 --> 10:52.693
HEY! I'M TESTING OUT

10:49.107 --> 10:52.693
MY SHOPPING HEELS FOR TOMORROW.

10:49.107 --> 10:52.693
(door closes)

10:52.735 --> 10:54.695
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

10:52.735 --> 10:54.695
WHAT?

10:54.737 --> 10:56.864
BENJAMIN WAS FINALLY

10:54.737 --> 10:56.864
BEING HONEST WITH YOU,

10:56.906 --> 10:59.200
AND YOU TELL HIM

10:56.906 --> 10:59.200
THIS BIG, HUGE LIE?

10:59.242 --> 11:01.202
WELL, THE SECOND HE SAID

10:59.242 --> 11:01.202
"NO MORE GAMES,"

11:01.244 --> 11:02.703
I GOT INSTANTLY BORED.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.623
I REALIZED THAT'S

11:02.745 --> 11:04.623
THE ONLY REASON I WAS INTO HIM,

11:04.664 --> 11:05.873
SO I GOT OUT OF IT.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.208
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.586
I THINK HE FINALLY STARTED

11:07.250 --> 11:09.586
BEING HONEST WITH YOU,

11:09.628 --> 11:11.712
AND YOU GOT SCARED

11:09.628 --> 11:11.712
AND YOU BAILED.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.714
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.714
YOU RUN.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.008
NO, I DON'T.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.511
TEDDY, WILL YOU PLEASE TALK

11:15.049 --> 11:17.511
SOME SENSE INTO HER?

11:15.049 --> 11:17.511
UGH.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.387
AS YOU CAN SEE,

11:17.552 --> 11:19.387
I DON'T REALLY LIKE ELI.

11:19.429 --> 11:21.097
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, TEDFORD?

11:19.429 --> 11:21.097
FLIP MY PANCAKES?

11:21.139 --> 11:23.517
HOPE YOU HAVE

11:21.139 --> 11:23.517
10-FOOT LONG ARMS!

11:23.558 --> 11:25.435
STOP CALLING ME "TEDFORD."

11:25.477 --> 11:26.978
STOP SECRETLY LOVING IT!

11:27.020 --> 11:29.314
THESE ARE OUR FULL DINNERS,

11:27.020 --> 11:29.314
BY THE WAY.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.314
(sighs)

11:29.356 --> 11:31.358
I HAD TO HAVE A VERY

11:29.356 --> 11:31.358
UNCOMFORTABLE CHAT WITH BENJAMIN

11:31.399 --> 11:32.733
AS THEY WERE BOXED UP.

11:32.775 --> 11:35.820
I MEAN, IS SHE SERIOUS?

11:32.775 --> 11:35.820
IS THIS A GAME?

11:35.862 --> 11:38.239
YEAH, I-I DON'T KNOW.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.239
(sighs) I DON'T KNOW.

11:38.281 --> 11:41.242
HI. UM, CAN YOU JUST--CAN YOU

11:38.281 --> 11:41.242
JUST WRAP UP THIS BREAD FOR US

11:41.284 --> 11:42.785
REALLY QUICKLY? THANK YOU.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.785
SURE.

I FREAKED OUT, AND IT BECAME

18:48.252 --> 18:50.170
THIS WHOLE THING,

18:50.212 --> 18:52.214
AND THEN JUNE ATE A LOT OF FOOD

18:50.212 --> 18:52.214
IN A SWIMSUIT.

18:52.256 --> 18:56.218
BUT THE THOUGHT

18:52.256 --> 18:56.218
OF NOT SEEING YOU AGAIN...

18:58.012 --> 18:59.179
JUST THESE PAST FEW MONTHS,

18:59.221 --> 19:01.223
I SAW SO MANY THINGS

18:59.221 --> 19:01.223
I WANTED TO TELL YOU ABOUT.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.101
I SAW A BIKE MESSENGER

19:01.265 --> 19:03.101

19:03.142 --> 19:06.186
TWO JUNKIES ARGUING ABOUT

19:03.142 --> 19:06.186
WHICH SUBWAY TO TAKE UPTOWN.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.106
JUNKIES ARGUING

19:06.228 --> 19:08.106
OVER MUNDANE THINGS

19:08.188 --> 19:10.274
IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS

19:08.188 --> 19:10.274
ABOUT NEW YORK.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.901
I KNOW! MINE, TOO!

19:11.943 --> 19:14.487
CHLOE, I DON'T CARE THAT

19:11.943 --> 19:14.487
YOU WENT TO CRAZY CAMP AS A KID.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.281
GOD, DO YOU CARE

19:14.528 --> 19:17.281

19:20.451 --> 19:23.454
"Dirty Paws" playing)

19:25.247 --> 19:26.457
YOU KISS LIKE A FAT KID.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.875

19:26.499 --> 19:27.875
A CRAZY PERSON.

19:27.917 --> 19:31.504

19:32.755 --> 19:34.465

19:34.507 --> 19:37.217

19:37.259 --> 19:40.304

19:37.259 --> 19:40.304

19:40.346 --> 19:43.099
YEAH. I FIGURED OUT WHY PEOPLE

19:40.346 --> 19:43.099
WEREN'T FIGHTING OVER MY JEANS.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.225
IT'S NOT THE JEANS' FAULT.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.225
IT'S MY FAULT.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.478
SEE, I LET A GREAT PAIR OF JEANS

19:45.267 --> 19:47.478

19:47.520 --> 19:49.313
WITHOUT A GREAT SHIRT AND A BELT

19:47.520 --> 19:49.313
TO SET THEM OFF.

19:59.281 --> 20:02.118
