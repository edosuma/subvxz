01:16.246 --> 01:18.252
Outrageous.

01:18.253 --> 01:20.425
This is the part where the slime 
monster

01:20.426 --> 01:23.536
scarfs up the entire
city of Cleveland.

01:23.537 --> 01:24.940
I warn you,

01:24.941 --> 01:27.114
too much television warps the mind

01:27.115 --> 01:28.652
And promotes violence.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.625
Right.
You bet.

01:30.626 --> 01:32.063
You're right, master. 

01:32.064 --> 01:34.772
What's this thing, boss ?

01:34.773 --> 01:36.912
Another toy from Krang ?

01:36.913 --> 01:40.457
It happens to be a state-of-the-art
matter transporter.

01:40.458 --> 01:44.670
With it, I can transmit
an object anywhere in the world.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.209
Like what ?

01:46.210 --> 01:50.389
Like sending two ill-mannered slobs
to the city dump.

01:53.701 --> 01:56.677
What's this place ?

01:56.678 --> 02:01.392
Maybe it's one of them nouvelle
cuisine restaurants.

02:07.111 --> 02:09.686
I guess they want to make sure

02:09.687 --> 02:12.227
you wash before you eat.

02:14.569 --> 02:16.609
Oh, awesome.

02:16.610 --> 02:19.417
Who's the slime monster
gonna scarf up next ?

02:19.418 --> 02:22.194
Who cares as long as she's a real
good screamer.

02:23.198 --> 02:25.772
It's the ninja turtles !

02:25.773 --> 02:28.113
Rocksteady and Bebop !

02:28.114 --> 02:31.691
We're gonna turn you guys
into turtle mush !

02:32.763 --> 02:36.775
Now it's my turn, wart-breath.

02:36.776 --> 02:38.279
Beginner's luck.

02:44.367 --> 02:47.141
Let's get it on, tusk-teeth.

02:50.152 --> 02:54.399
Oh, no ! He's turned our TV set
into a vast wasteland.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.409
This time, he's gone too far.

02:57.410 --> 03:00.351
Turtle power !
Turtle power !

03:03.529 --> 03:06.438
I'm coming to help you, Bebop.

03:06.439 --> 03:09.348
Not really, dude.

03:10.620 --> 03:12.959
I think those idiots have learned

03:12.960 --> 03:17.240
their lesson by now.

03:17.241 --> 03:19.614
Scat ! Get away !

03:19.615 --> 03:21.520
No ! Look out !

03:21.521 --> 03:22.925
Blasted cat !

03:22.926 --> 03:24.564
All right, chumps !

03:25.902 --> 03:27.440
They've disappeared.

03:27.441 --> 03:30.952
Like vaporized !

03:30.953 --> 03:34.663
I am pleased you have at last 
turned down the television.

03:35.935 --> 03:38.576
Why'd you bring
us back, boss ?

03:38.577 --> 03:42.088
Yeah. We was just
about to pulverize

03:42.089 --> 03:43.492
them shell backs.

03:43.493 --> 03:46.301
You found the turtles'
hiding place ?

03:46.302 --> 03:47.505
We sure did.

03:47.506 --> 03:50.080
Quickly. What was the exact location ?

03:50.081 --> 03:51.653
Well, let's see...

03:51.654 --> 03:54.361
First, we went this way.

03:54.362 --> 03:57.037
Then, we went that way.

03:57.038 --> 03:59.344
I think we turned left.
Or was it right ?

03:59.345 --> 04:01.351
Or was it down and then up ?

04:01.352 --> 04:04.060
All them sewers looks alike to me.

04:04.061 --> 04:05.464
Silence !

04:05.465 --> 04:09.209
Serves me right for using
cheap mutant labor.

04:09.210 --> 04:11.651
Oh, bummer, man.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.323
Could you fix it, Donatello ?

04:13.324 --> 04:15.999
I don't know.
It looks pretty far gone.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.142
You mean we're gonna miss
it came from the sewers ?

04:19.142 --> 04:21.617
Well, that's my favorite flick !

04:21.618 --> 04:24.292
Don't panic, fellas.
Maybe April can help us.

04:24.293 --> 04:27.035
This is April O'Neill,
Channel 6 news,

04:27.036 --> 04:28.472
speaking with this year's winner

04:28.473 --> 04:31.850
of the fat cabbies contest,
Myron Bimbleton.

04:31.851 --> 04:34.459
Tell us, what is the secret
of your success ?

04:34.460 --> 04:37.301
Chili burgers and onions.

04:37.302 --> 04:39.776
Lots of onions.

04:39.777 --> 04:42.250
You said a mouthful, Myron.

04:42.251 --> 04:45.127
This is April O'Neill.
Channel 6 news.

04:45.128 --> 04:47.234
Ok. That's a wrap.

04:47.235 --> 04:48.705
Really, Vernon,

04:48.706 --> 04:51.648
Why must I do these idiotic
human interest stories ?

04:51.649 --> 04:54.190
Because the public eats them up.

04:54.191 --> 04:56.330
Right. With lots of onions.

04:56.331 --> 04:58.403
My,

04:58.404 --> 05:01.045
April here.
What's up, guys ?

05:01.046 --> 05:03.687
We've got an emergency
and we need your help.

05:03.688 --> 05:06.329
Now, this sounds like a real story.

05:06.330 --> 05:07.902
Yeah, right.

05:07.903 --> 05:10.510
There are these gigantic alligators
in the sewer.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.286
Fantastic ! I'll bring my video camera.

05:13.287 --> 05:16.329
We'd rather you brought
a spare TV instead.

05:17.601 --> 05:19.673
You got me over here

05:19.674 --> 05:23.051
so you could watch a movie about 
alligators in the sewers ?

05:23.052 --> 05:24.790
Exactamundo.

05:24.791 --> 05:27.365
Awesome flick, isn't it ?

05:27.366 --> 05:28.970
Hey, you guys want to hold it down ?

05:28.971 --> 05:30.575
You're drowning out all the screams.

05:30.576 --> 05:33.251
What happened here ?
World War III ?

05:33.252 --> 05:37.264
Not quite. There was a fight with
2 of Shredder's thugs.

05:37.265 --> 05:39.237
Here ? But how ?

05:39.238 --> 05:42.547
This sewer home of yours is the 
best-kept secret in the city

05:42.548 --> 05:45.792
they must have used some form of
matter transporter.

05:45.793 --> 05:48.634
Wow. That would make some story.

05:48.635 --> 05:51.243
If we could find Shredder's hideout.

05:51.244 --> 05:52.480
Chinese food ?

05:52.481 --> 05:55.056
Don't tell me that you guys
have given up pizza ?

05:55.057 --> 05:56.995
It's rocksteady and bebop's.

05:56.996 --> 05:59.169
It's not bad enough
they trashed the place,

05:59.170 --> 06:01.176
they also left their garbage !

06:01.177 --> 06:04.854
Woo's oriental Palace. 

06:04.855 --> 06:08.800
So long, guys.
Enjoy your movie.

06:08.801 --> 06:10.941
Hey, she can't go to woo's by herself.

06:10.942 --> 06:12.947
That place is really bad.

06:12.948 --> 06:14.452
The food is even worse.

06:14.453 --> 06:16.760
We better follow her.

06:16.761 --> 06:20.739
Something tells me
I shouldn't be doing this,

06:20.740 --> 06:22.478
but here goes.

06:22.479 --> 06:25.087
What a dive.

06:30.605 --> 06:32.913
Excuse me.

06:32.914 --> 06:35.922
I am Woo.
Who are you ?

06:35.923 --> 06:39.333
I'm April O'Neill, a TV reporter.

06:39.334 --> 06:44.115
We do not like nosy reporters.

06:44.116 --> 06:47.125
I'm not that kind of reporter.

06:47.126 --> 06:49.633
I'm a restaurant critic.

06:50.638 --> 06:52.610
Delicious.

06:55.420 --> 06:59.265
Did you serve a couple of
weird-looking customers

06:59.266 --> 07:01.372
in the last hour ? one that looks 
like a rhino

07:01.373 --> 07:03.111
and the other looks like a wart hog.

07:03.112 --> 07:07.358
I remember them.
They wore halloween masks.

07:07.359 --> 07:09.799
They came from warehouse
at end of pier.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.709
Thanks. I'll recommend
this place to my friends.

07:13.846 --> 07:17.458
Hey, shorty,
Where's my won tons ?

07:19.666 --> 07:22.307
All out of won tons.

07:24.716 --> 07:28.093
This must be
The matter transporter
Splinter talked about.

07:28.094 --> 07:32.006
I'd better back
This story up
With some photos.

07:37.189 --> 07:39.195
Scat, kitty.
You're in my shot.

07:46.921 --> 07:49.195
W-what happened ?

07:50.767 --> 07:53.275
I--i feel so woozy.

07:53.276 --> 07:56.720
What's going on ?

08:03.710 --> 08:05.849
April ?

08:08.559 --> 08:11.869
April, you know the landlord
Doesn't allow pets.

08:11.870 --> 08:14.979
What could i do, irma ?
They followed me home.

08:14.980 --> 08:16.952
Wow, what a day.

08:16.953 --> 08:19.260
I feel like something
The cat dragged in.

08:19.261 --> 08:22.603
Gee. Let me fix you
Something to eat.

08:22.604 --> 08:24.811
That sounds good.

08:24.812 --> 08:27.821
First, i'll feed
Your furry friends.

08:27.822 --> 08:30.429
You're a nice person
For a human.

08:30.430 --> 08:32.302
How's that
Again ?

08:32.303 --> 08:35.010
Don't mind
Me-ow, irma.

08:35.011 --> 08:37.653
I'm so tired, i don't
Know what i'm saying.

08:37.654 --> 08:39.558
Well, i'll leave you

08:39.559 --> 08:42.335
So you can take
A little cat nap.

08:45.078 --> 08:47.352
Ooh. I thought
She'd never leave.

08:50.396 --> 08:52.100
You know,
I'm getting pretty bored

08:52.101 --> 08:53.639
With these private eye
Disguises.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.344
Sorry, fellas,

08:55.345 --> 08:56.982
But our french poodle suits
Are still at the cleaners.

08:56.983 --> 09:00.160
Quit griping, guys.
We're trying
To help april.

09:00.161 --> 09:02.434
And this is where
We'll find her.

09:06.883 --> 09:09.056
I smell trouble.

09:09.057 --> 09:11.731
Can't smell worse
Than the food.

09:11.732 --> 09:14.908
Who are you supposed to be,
Humphrey bogus ?

09:14.909 --> 09:17.918
You hit the nail
Right on the head,
Sweetheart.

09:17.919 --> 09:20.393
Yeah ! Now, listen here,
You mugs.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.967
I'm giving the orders
Around here, see ?

09:22.968 --> 09:25.174
All right,
So i don't do bogart.

09:25.175 --> 09:26.580
Enough stalling !

09:26.581 --> 09:29.355
You turkeys
Are about
To get plucked.

09:29.356 --> 09:30.793
Wrong, bozo !

09:30.794 --> 09:32.700
We're turtles,
Not turkeys.

09:32.701 --> 09:36.713
Ohh, i'm going to
Make turtle stew.

09:36.714 --> 09:39.890
This one's on me, fellas.
Hyah !

09:41.696 --> 09:44.237
Back at you,
Cabbage heads. Unh !

09:46.044 --> 09:48.184
Allow me.

09:50.024 --> 09:55.139
Man, there's nothing like
A furious, fun-filled,
Food flinging fight !

09:55.140 --> 09:58.049
Try saying that
Three times fast.

09:59.187 --> 10:01.427
One minute
To air time, april.

10:02.899 --> 10:04.804
Was it
Something i said ?

10:04.805 --> 10:07.647
Meo-out ! Out ! Out !

10:07.648 --> 10:11.092
Well, there's no need
To get catty.

10:11.093 --> 10:13.165
April, i'm worried.

10:13.166 --> 10:15.673
You're not acting at all
Like yourself.

10:15.674 --> 10:18.917
You'd better go, irma.
Nowww !

10:18.918 --> 10:21.492
Not until
You tell me
What's going on !

10:21.493 --> 10:25.271
I went to the hideout
Of thisss character
Called shredder.

10:25.272 --> 10:27.813
I was taking pictures
Of sssome machine...

10:29.352 --> 10:33.164
When sssomething
Happened to me-ow !

10:33.165 --> 10:35.571
Gosh.
Oh, my gosh.

10:35.572 --> 10:38.180
It's turned you
Into a cat.

10:38.181 --> 10:41.056
Yesss. That's why
I must go back

10:41.057 --> 10:43.430
And reverse
What happened.
[meow]

10:43.431 --> 10:44.935
No way !

10:44.936 --> 10:47.109
I'm not letting you
Out of this room !

10:48.548 --> 10:50.955
Of course, if you
Insist on going...

10:50.956 --> 10:53.697
Don't worry
About me-ow.

10:56.808 --> 11:00.820
My best friend
Has turned into a cat.

11:00.821 --> 11:03.863
I don't know whether to call 911
Or the animal shelter.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.336
What's this ?

11:05.337 --> 11:08.178
Some kind of
Weird walkie-talkie ?

11:08.179 --> 11:10.352
Hello ? Hello ?

11:10.353 --> 11:12.291
Those kung fu guys
Turned out to be

11:12.292 --> 11:14.131
A bunch of
Chicken lo meins.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.472
Yeah, with the accent
On "lo."

11:16.473 --> 11:19.382
Irma: hello,
Is anyone there ?

11:19.383 --> 11:20.886
Who are you ?

11:20.887 --> 11:22.324
Never mind that.
Who are you ?

11:22.325 --> 11:23.863
I'm leonardo.

11:23.864 --> 11:27.240
You really are a turtle.

11:27.241 --> 11:28.745
Congratulations, lady.

11:28.746 --> 11:31.186
You just won
The national
Wildlife award.

11:31.187 --> 11:34.263
April's in trouble.
If you care anything
About her,

11:34.264 --> 11:36.437
Meet me at
The subway station
At 4TH and broadway

11:36.438 --> 11:37.774
And i'll explain
Everything.

11:37.775 --> 11:39.246
We're on our way.

11:39.247 --> 11:41.787
Ok, guys,
It's turtle time !

11:45.200 --> 11:49.078
I mussst remember which
Buttons the cat touched.

11:49.079 --> 11:51.687
Someone is
Snooping around.

11:51.688 --> 11:52.823
Hey, you !

11:57.072 --> 12:00.415
What do you know,
It's half animal.

12:00.416 --> 12:02.789
Yeah, just like us.

12:02.790 --> 12:06.201
Miss o'neill,
What are you
Doing here ?

12:08.208 --> 12:09.913
So that's it.

12:09.914 --> 12:12.588
You've been
Transmutated
With a cat.

12:12.589 --> 12:13.792
This should
Hold you.

12:15.833 --> 12:19.444
Get her something to eat.
It may calm her down.

12:19.445 --> 12:22.019
Oh, i've got just
The thing, boss.

12:22.020 --> 12:24.160
Hey, kitty,

12:24.161 --> 12:27.938
Look at what bebop
Brought you for dindin.

12:30.381 --> 12:32.386
You fool !

12:32.387 --> 12:35.563
She's still more
Female than feline.

12:35.564 --> 12:38.573
She might not
Eat a rodent,

12:38.574 --> 12:42.051
But perhaps
She'll help me
Hunt one down.

12:45.865 --> 12:47.971
Excuse me, did you
Happen to see--

12:49.610 --> 12:53.221
Oh, wow ! The t--

12:53.222 --> 12:55.027
Cool it.
We're top secret.

12:55.028 --> 12:58.271
Yeah, like,
You want to blow
Our cover ?

12:58.272 --> 13:01.214
Oh, sorry. I guess
I got carried away.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.655
Ok. So what happened
To april ?

13:03.656 --> 13:06.063
Well, first
She turned into a cat,

13:06.064 --> 13:07.501
And then she drank milk
From a saucer,

13:07.502 --> 13:09.107
And then she jumped out
The window

13:09.108 --> 13:10.611
And then she went to
Some man called shredder--

13:10.612 --> 13:13.453
Slow down.

13:13.454 --> 13:15.460
Right. Could you,
Like, rewind that

13:15.461 --> 13:17.634
And play it back
At normal speed ?

13:17.635 --> 13:19.941
She said april went
To shredder's hideout.

13:19.942 --> 13:21.312
That's all we need to know.

13:21.313 --> 13:23.319
Did she happen to
Tell you where it is ?

13:23.320 --> 13:27.064
No, but she did
Take some pictures
Of the place.

13:27.065 --> 13:28.804
Maybe they're still
At her apartment.

13:28.805 --> 13:31.780
Her apartment ?
Let's go !

13:31.781 --> 13:36.028
Don't be frightened.
I am your friend.

13:36.029 --> 13:38.368
No.

13:38.369 --> 13:40.877
You are enemy.

13:40.878 --> 13:44.957
Here, kitty.
A brand-new collar.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.064
How come
You're giving her

13:47.065 --> 13:49.371
Such pretty
Presents, boss ?

13:49.372 --> 13:51.846
It's not a present,
You cretin.

13:51.847 --> 13:53.652
The effects of
The molecular crossover

13:53.653 --> 13:56.059
Will only last
A short time,

13:56.060 --> 13:57.264
But with that collar,

13:57.265 --> 14:00.909
She will obey
My every command forever.

14:00.910 --> 14:05.591
And i command you
To hunt down splinter.

14:05.592 --> 14:10.172
Yesss, massster.

14:22.982 --> 14:24.753
Which one is
April's apartment ?

14:24.754 --> 14:26.827
It's that one
Up there.

14:28.533 --> 14:30.740
And look what's
Down here.

14:42.044 --> 14:44.050
Uh, april,
Is that you ?

14:45.723 --> 14:47.060
I guess not.

14:47.061 --> 14:50.336
You guys start climbing.
I'll handle this.

14:51.408 --> 14:53.681
Back, big fellow. Back !

15:02.946 --> 15:05.687
That was great,
Michelangelo. Thanks.

15:05.688 --> 15:07.994
Oh, nothing to it, bud.

15:07.995 --> 15:11.138
Just remember, pizza's
The perfect payback.

15:11.139 --> 15:14.214
Hi, fellas.
What took you so long ?

15:14.215 --> 15:16.188
Irma ! How'd
You get in here ?

15:16.189 --> 15:17.526
I've got a key.

15:17.527 --> 15:21.104
You mean we climbed
That fire escape
For nothing ?

15:21.105 --> 15:23.646
It's ok.
We needed the workout.

15:23.647 --> 15:25.418
I found
April's notes.

15:25.419 --> 15:26.956
It says this guy
Shredder's hideout

15:26.957 --> 15:28.662
Is an old warehouse
On the dock.

15:28.663 --> 15:30.669
And here are some photos
She took of the place.

15:30.670 --> 15:32.675
It's a molecular
Transporter.

15:32.676 --> 15:34.347
Then splinter
Was right.

15:34.348 --> 15:36.086
How to

15:36.087 --> 15:38.494
Like,
That's the same cat
In every photo.

15:38.495 --> 15:40.500
That explains
Everything.

15:40.501 --> 15:43.377
April and the cat
Must've gotten their
Molecules switched.

15:43.378 --> 15:45.183
Which means that
Somewhere out there

15:45.184 --> 15:46.922
Is a cat who's
Trying to choose

15:46.923 --> 15:49.396
Just the right
Nail polish
For its claws.

15:49.397 --> 15:52.339
Turtles, we've got
To find april.

15:55.685 --> 15:58.761
Finally, the lair
Is as it should be,

15:58.762 --> 16:01.268
But where are
Those turtles ?

16:06.954 --> 16:09.127
Go away ! Out of here !

16:11.402 --> 16:15.081
Cats--the one creature
I truly fear.

16:15.082 --> 16:20.330
Yes, massster,
I hear you.

16:20.331 --> 16:24.176
We must destroy sssplinter.

16:24.177 --> 16:27.353
Oh, what delicious irony.

16:27.354 --> 16:31.734
Soon they will find splinter
And tear him to shreds.

16:31.735 --> 16:36.048
Well, shredder, you finally
Did something right.

16:36.049 --> 16:38.289
May i remind you, krang,

16:38.290 --> 16:40.631
It was your transporter
That malfunctioned.

16:40.632 --> 16:45.713
Oh ? And now
You'd like me to send
A repairman, right ?

16:45.714 --> 16:50.396
Maybe you'd like me
To fix your washing
Machine, too.

16:50.397 --> 16:52.235
Just the instructions
Will do.

16:52.236 --> 16:55.579
All right,
But i warn you,

16:55.580 --> 16:57.920
When i send
The technodrome,

16:57.921 --> 17:00.863
There will be
No second chances.

17:02.436 --> 17:04.642
Om...

17:04.643 --> 17:09.257
I must rid my mind of
This dreaded fear of cats.

17:09.258 --> 17:11.798
Om...

17:14.007 --> 17:18.185
My deepest nightmare
Come to life.

17:20.027 --> 17:22.333
April !
What's come over you ?

17:24.374 --> 17:26.714
I must try to contact
The turtles.

17:26.714 --> 17:29.691
Yoo-hoo ! Here,
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

17:29.692 --> 17:32.098
Oh, there's a million cats
In this city

17:32.099 --> 17:34.406
And we're supposed to find
One ordinary stray ?

17:37.183 --> 17:40.091
Hi there, pussycat.
What's your name ?

17:43.904 --> 17:46.379
Is that really you, april ?

17:49.022 --> 17:51.528
See ? I told you
I was her favorite.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.732
It's not you, man.

17:52.733 --> 17:54.706
It's those anchovy
Pizzas you eat.

17:54.707 --> 17:59.454
The turtlecom.

18:01.997 --> 18:04.136
Master !
Come in, master !

18:04.137 --> 18:06.210
Splinter
Needs our help.

18:06.211 --> 18:09.520
Splinter. Who's that ?
He sounds cute.

18:09.521 --> 18:11.527
Yeah. Cute enough to eat.

18:19.053 --> 18:21.126
Shredder must be
Behind this.

18:21.127 --> 18:23.098
But how did
He find me ?

18:23.099 --> 18:25.305
I led him here.

18:25.306 --> 18:30.790
Master shredder sent us
To destroy you.

18:30.791 --> 18:32.630
I will not fight you.

18:32.631 --> 18:35.907
That will not ssstop me.

18:35.908 --> 18:39.150
No. I do not know what
Shredder has done to you,

18:39.151 --> 18:41.324
But you are still my friend

18:41.325 --> 18:43.331
And the turtles' friend.

18:43.332 --> 18:44.669
Turtles ?

18:44.670 --> 18:47.579
Yes ! You care deeply
For one another.

18:47.580 --> 18:50.521
No ! That was
In the passst.

18:50.522 --> 18:55.103
Sssay farewell,
Master splinter.

18:56.241 --> 18:59.350
April, no ! It's us !

18:59.351 --> 19:00.955
The ninja turtles.

19:00.956 --> 19:03.396
Ninja turtles...

19:03.397 --> 19:04.868
My friends.

19:04.869 --> 19:08.280
Right, and this is
Our <I>sensei, remember ?

19:08.281 --> 19:12.593
Yesss, also my friend.

19:12.594 --> 19:14.098
No !

19:14.099 --> 19:15.101
It's that collar !

19:15.102 --> 19:17.108
It's controlling
Her thoughts !

19:17.109 --> 19:18.948
Mussst kill all of you !

19:18.949 --> 19:22.291
Shredder commands it !
[yowls]

19:22.292 --> 19:25.703
Holy cat ! She's gone
Totally nutsoid !

19:25.704 --> 19:27.575
I'll take
Care of this.

19:27.576 --> 19:30.084
No, leonardo, don't !
What are you doing ?

19:30.085 --> 19:31.488
Just this !

19:33.095 --> 19:35.501
So much for shredder's
Thought control.

19:35.502 --> 19:37.742
Wh-what happened ?

19:37.743 --> 19:41.521
Let's just say
For a while there,
You were catatonic.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.708
We're not out
Of the jungle yet.

19:47.709 --> 19:50.150
And this one's
Not wearing a collar.

19:50.151 --> 19:52.557
Chill out, dudes.
This one's on me.

20:02.992 --> 20:04.629
Got you.

20:07.574 --> 20:10.483
That ought to hold
Him until we can
Notify the zoo.

20:10.484 --> 20:13.994
Boy, michelangelo,
You and your dumb toys.

20:13.995 --> 20:15.933
Like i always say,

20:15.934 --> 20:18.810
Never look a gift
Mouse in the mouth.

20:20.783 --> 20:23.491
Blast it !
My control over

20:23.492 --> 20:26.635
April o'neill's
Thought waves
Has been terminated.

20:26.636 --> 20:29.979
So, what do we do
With her lunch ?

20:29.980 --> 20:33.491
Ow ! He did it again.

20:33.492 --> 20:36.200
Don't sweat it.
I'll get the little nipper.

20:36.201 --> 20:38.407
No, you idiot. Don't !

20:40.715 --> 20:44.660
Uh-oh. I think
We broke it.

20:44.661 --> 20:48.406
What do you mean we, horn head ?

20:48.407 --> 20:51.583
Hurry, you cretins.
Out of here !

20:54.661 --> 20:59.576
I'll get you turtles yet,
if it's the last thing I do !

21:00.848 --> 21:03.555
Well, April, how's it feel
being a human again ?

21:03.556 --> 21:06.432
Awful. My nails are
absolutely ruined

21:06.433 --> 21:08.739
from walking around on all fours.

21:08.740 --> 21:12.184
Yep. She's back to being
a woman, all right.

21:12.185 --> 21:15.594
Splinter ?
Are you in there ?

21:15.595 --> 21:18.203
Irma, what are you
doing in the sewers ?

21:18.204 --> 21:22.317
Well, a woman will go to any 
depths to meet her dream man.

21:22.318 --> 21:25.461
Now, where is
this hunky Splinter guy ?

21:25.462 --> 21:27.133
I am Splinter.

21:27.134 --> 21:31.045
You're a... you're a rat !

21:31.047 --> 21:34.791
Precisely.
You must be Irma.

21:34.792 --> 21:37.299
Wrong.
I must be going.
