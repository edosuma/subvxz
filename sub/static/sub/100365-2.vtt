WEBVTT

01:47.149 --> 01:48.150
Pepita...

01:48.859 --> 01:50.360
I told you to fold the clothes.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.445
I am folding the clothes.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.405
No, you're balling it up.

01:54.031 --> 01:58.035
Can you imagine being this rich
and deciding to put that in your home?

01:58.285 --> 01:59.453
I don't know...

01:59.745 --> 02:01.079
Maybe I should become an artist.

02:01.163 --> 02:02.289
She's going to hear you.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.373
What?

02:04.041 --> 02:05.918
She can't understand us.

02:06.168 --> 02:07.878
Bring the laundry.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.845
My mom loves your art.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.641
Tell her thank you. Gracias.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.935
Gracias, Gloria.

02:48.794 --> 02:50.504
Hey, chato. Get up.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.048
I gotta put the vacuum back here.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.592
Come on. I worked, like, 15 hours today.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.761
Here. Pretend it's your girlfriend.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.974
Yo, give us some privacy.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.310
-Bye, mijo.
-Bye, Ma.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.106
Fool, I don't care if it's from Goodwill.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.942
You need to wipe this thing
and get some new songs.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.653
I don't know.
Gary's shit's starting to grow on me.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.205
Hey, Diego.

05:30.289 --> 05:31.623
Pick me, pick me.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.542
Three dollars, I do your drywall.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.545
I don't even do drywall.

05:54.897 --> 05:55.898
Hey.

05:56.315 --> 05:58.525
You wanna play you-don't-want-that?
Here, I'll go first.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.906
-You don't want that.
-Rosado!

06:04.698 --> 06:05.824
I saw that.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.372
All right. Behavior log.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.259
That's your mom's signature?

06:24.718 --> 06:26.386
That looks a lot like your handwriting.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.096
Yeah, 'cause we're related.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.890
I don't know how long
we're gonna play this game

06:29.973 --> 06:32.059
or what it's gonna take
to make you care about your future.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.602
Oh, my God. This talk again?

06:33.685 --> 06:35.646
Yeah. There are colleges that--

06:35.729 --> 06:36.772
Don't laugh.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.775
There are scholarships you can apply for.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.154
What? Are you gonna lend me
your Social Security number?

06:47.115 --> 06:50.327
You have to get this signed by your mom
or I'll have to suspend you.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.943
This water thing is nice.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.945
Hey, can I help you?

07:25.028 --> 07:26.029
Hey. Yeah.

07:26.113 --> 07:29.575
We're here for the squash thing.

07:31.785 --> 07:32.786
Okay, cool.

07:34.663 --> 07:37.291
Oh, my God. It smells like money in here.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.251
Focus. Free shoes, remember?

07:51.054 --> 07:54.016
Girls, please. Right now
you are meant to be bouncing your balls.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.854
You hear that, Marisol?
Bounce those balls.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.564
You're the queen of balls.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.774
I have heard these all before.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.234
Your jokes are not fresh.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.737
-You, come with me.
-Why?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.864
The runt is always first to go.

08:09.656 --> 08:13.118
Okay. Everybody out, on the other side
of the glass. Let's go.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.495
And close the door behind you.

08:20.876 --> 08:21.877
Thank you.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.507
Squash is simple. Just hit the ball.

08:26.924 --> 08:29.968
I am not looking for skills
because you don't have any.

08:30.928 --> 08:32.429
Especially you.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.472
I am looking for instincts.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.390
Ready?

08:36.475 --> 08:37.476
Here we go.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.650
In the beginning, you will lose more
than you win, so it's okay if you cry.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.944
-I don't cry.
-No?

08:48.153 --> 08:49.154
Again.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.285
And again.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.541
Next.

09:00.624 --> 09:01.625
One more.

09:16.098 --> 09:17.641
Damn.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.476
Good. Very good.

09:20.519 --> 09:22.604
-Really?
-No, you were bad.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.024
But inside of you, there is a jaguar.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.653
Okay.

09:29.736 --> 09:33.615
In the words of the great
basketball player, Kevin Garnett,

09:33.699 --> 09:35.033
aka KG,

09:35.784 --> 09:37.870
"You cannot teach the beast.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.914
It is either in you or it is not.

09:42.165 --> 09:45.627
You cannot go to the store
and buy a six-pack of beast."

09:47.838 --> 09:49.089
Next.

09:49.173 --> 09:50.716
I'm feeling food.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.801
-That's fine?
-Okay. Let's do pizza?

09:52.885 --> 09:54.428
-Yes, the mall. Right now.
-Okay.

09:54.845 --> 09:55.846
Hey, hey.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.308
Those don't go home with you.

09:59.391 --> 10:00.851
-What?
-The shoes.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.603
You do not get to take them with you.

10:02.686 --> 10:03.687
Seriously?

10:03.770 --> 10:05.439
You must come back to have them.

10:05.522 --> 10:06.857
That's messed up.

10:07.566 --> 10:10.319
I got a cousin in law school.
You're lucky we don't sue.

10:10.402 --> 10:13.071
Let's bounce, Marisol.
They don't want us here.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.703
Tuesday, 3:00 p.m.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.580
I will see you?

10:24.333 --> 10:26.376
How many times must I tell you?

10:26.460 --> 10:28.337
My garage, my rules.

10:28.420 --> 10:31.590
So, you must keep your belongings
in your own refrigerator.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.509
Not everything fits in ours.

10:33.592 --> 10:34.927
That's not my problem.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.931
This refrigerator is "Off-limits. Sanjay."

10:39.890 --> 10:40.891
My ham.

10:41.350 --> 10:42.392
My property.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.688
There you are! It's so late!

10:47.940 --> 10:49.691
Ask him about the sink.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.528
Hey. When are you gonna
get someone to fix the sink?

10:53.195 --> 10:55.739
I told you,
I'm waiting to hear back from my cousin.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.825
It's been two months.
That sound is making me crazy.

10:58.909 --> 10:59.910
So?

11:00.410 --> 11:01.578
Call the police.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.585
I'm gonna shit on that guy's ham.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.004
Yummy.

11:11.088 --> 11:12.089
You know what?

11:12.798 --> 11:16.093
A woman from your school called me.
She says you have something to show me.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.719
A list of your behavior?

11:17.803 --> 11:18.804
No big deal.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.390
Yes, yes, okay, but show me. Quick.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.235
I don't understand this. Mijo.

11:33.944 --> 11:35.362
Come here.

11:45.539 --> 11:46.748
Nothing special, you know...

11:47.207 --> 11:49.042
Just that she's doing pretty good.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.752
Cut the shit.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.008
Okay.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.511
Monday, Marisol stood up
in the middle of class...

11:59.595 --> 12:02.472
and yelled: "History is bullshit."

12:03.849 --> 12:06.560
Tuesday, Marisol was late to class...

12:06.643 --> 12:11.023
and threw a pencil in the ceiling
as the teacher was lecturing.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.108
But then Wednesday...

12:13.692 --> 12:14.693
Huh, no.

12:14.776 --> 12:18.947
Wednesday, Marisol threw the teacher's
grade book in the trash.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.539
Ma. Ma, it's not a big deal.

12:27.623 --> 12:29.541
"It's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal."

12:29.958 --> 12:31.710
That's what you say about everything.

12:32.294 --> 12:36.882
Your brother quit school to get a job,
so that you could keep going.

12:37.299 --> 12:40.427
If it's "No big deal," then
maybe you should stop going to school.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.693
The jaguar returns.

12:57.736 --> 12:58.904
Where's your friend?

12:58.987 --> 13:00.155
She quit.

13:00.239 --> 13:01.573
Thought you were a dick.

13:01.657 --> 13:03.742
That is correct. Why'd you come back?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.703
I dunno.
You said I had to come back for the shoes.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.121
I was lying.

13:09.414 --> 13:10.916
You can keep the shoes and go.

13:13.502 --> 13:15.087
But I think you like squash.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.381
-No, I don't.
-Now you are lying.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.092
Not everyone dives for the ball
like a crazy person.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.970
Dominguez y Rosado. Play.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.680
Everyone else, out. Let's go.

13:30.978 --> 13:31.979
Play.

13:36.316 --> 13:39.236
Stop. Rosado, what are you doing?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.363
You are swinging like a crazy person.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.615
Hitting hard will not make you win.

13:43.699 --> 13:45.701
I don't know how to play, man.
Just tell me what to do.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.369
Make a decision, "man."

13:47.953 --> 13:49.913
Just one.
Focus on what is in front of you.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.082
Winning is a series of good decisions.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.252
If I make a bad one?

13:58.130 --> 14:00.174
The ball always comes back.

14:00.591 --> 14:03.719
And when it does,
just make a different decision.

14:04.136 --> 14:05.137
You serve.

14:24.406 --> 14:25.574
How was that?

14:27.034 --> 14:28.160
Like a jaguar.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.074
Shut up, fool!

17:11.365 --> 17:15.077
No matter where you play,
you must know everything about the court.

17:15.577 --> 17:18.579
Every angle, every wall.

17:19.829 --> 17:22.791
Every one of these marks
is a different decision.

17:22.876 --> 17:25.587
If you listen, you can hear their stories.

17:26.213 --> 17:29.842
I am thinking you are ready
for a tournament yourself.

17:30.801 --> 17:31.885
I don't think so.

17:31.969 --> 17:33.595
Too late. I signed you up.

17:33.679 --> 17:37.140
I paid the $25 entry fee, so now you must.

17:37.975 --> 17:40.143
Come on.
We've been training for eight months.

17:42.855 --> 17:43.856
Well,

17:44.398 --> 17:47.359
I wouldn't wanna waste those $25.

17:47.442 --> 17:49.611
We will start you on local tournaments,

17:49.695 --> 17:50.946
then national,

17:51.655 --> 17:54.741
and then play international games.

17:54.825 --> 17:56.410
Fly all over the world.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.205
-I can't.
-You can. You're a jaguar.

18:00.289 --> 18:01.790
Can you just stop saying that?

18:01.874 --> 18:04.168
You're gonna be captain. Team USA.

18:04.251 --> 18:07.087
-You're dreaming.
-We are campaigning the Olympic Committee.

18:08.005 --> 18:10.215
-I don't have a passport.
-So then get one.

18:12.593 --> 18:13.594
I can't.

18:19.683 --> 18:20.851
Okay.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.770
Let's focus on this tournament right here.

18:25.355 --> 18:29.359
You know that girl
who is always practicing next door?

18:29.443 --> 18:32.696
Scandinavian with the bones in the cheeks.

18:32.779 --> 18:33.822
What is that?

18:34.573 --> 18:36.074
-Cheekbones?
-Yes.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.202
Have you heard her talk?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.621
She sound like a cartoon pony.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.123
Yeah. What about her?

18:43.207 --> 18:45.250
Her name is Charlotte Ansley.

18:45.334 --> 18:47.836
She's the top junior player of squash
in the state.

18:48.337 --> 18:49.880
Yeah. She is really good.

18:49.963 --> 18:50.964
Yes.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.552
And I can teach you how to destroy her.

18:56.595 --> 18:57.763
Would you like that?

19:01.099 --> 19:02.184
Excellent.

19:03.977 --> 19:07.022
Now you are ready
for your first tournament.

19:09.399 --> 19:12.736
He is Cuban. And very nice.

19:13.362 --> 19:15.656
He's a total gentleman.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.407
Is he fine?

19:18.242 --> 19:20.536
Don't be so nosy.

19:21.078 --> 19:22.079
You know what?

19:22.162 --> 19:23.789
There's no way I'm having any more babies.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.165
Especially, not after you.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.086
Check these out.

19:29.545 --> 19:31.713
Mr. Gilbert's sweatpants.

19:31.797 --> 19:33.841
They're new.
They'd be good for squash, right?

19:34.341 --> 19:36.927
I can't wear those!
That's not how people dress there.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.514
But aren't you running around, all sweaty?

19:40.597 --> 19:44.017
Yes, Mama, but you don't understand.
It's complicated.

19:44.434 --> 19:47.187
I don't want to show up
in Mrs. Gilbert's trash.

19:48.856 --> 19:49.857
Very well.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.527
Ma.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.653
It's okay.

20:13.130 --> 20:15.340
Rosado, ten. Wynberg, eight.

20:15.424 --> 20:16.842
Match point, Rosado.

20:40.574 --> 20:41.700
-Good game.
-Thank you very much.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.827
Your spacing was undisciplined.

20:43.911 --> 20:45.829
Were you trying to hit the ball or hug it?

20:45.913 --> 20:47.497
Because I could not tell.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.917
Tomorrow is the finals.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.171
If you play this way
against the cartoon pony, you will lose.

20:55.214 --> 20:56.507
I just won, man.

20:56.590 --> 20:58.383
Can you just say something nice?

21:00.886 --> 21:02.262
I love my grandma.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.056
-What?
-What?

21:04.139 --> 21:05.933
My grandmother is a very nice woman.

21:07.059 --> 21:08.769
Wipe that frown off your face.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.437
We have a party tonight.

21:11.188 --> 21:12.189
Right.

21:14.608 --> 21:17.611
I don't know.
Is it too much to wear a dress?

21:17.694 --> 21:18.820
I'm not going to answer that.

21:18.904 --> 21:21.198
You're the expert
on what squash people wear.

21:21.698 --> 21:22.783
Ma.

21:23.367 --> 21:25.452
This is at some big fancy house...

21:26.370 --> 21:28.413
for players who made it
to the championship.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.666
I knew you'd make it to the finals.

21:31.458 --> 21:34.503
That's weird,
because you told me I wouldn't.

21:35.170 --> 21:36.547
Reverse psychology.

21:38.632 --> 21:39.925
You're coming tomorrow, right?

21:40.008 --> 21:44.429
I wish I could but if I start blowing off
my clients, they'll get somebody else.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.723
But this is important.

21:46.807 --> 21:49.893
It's a four bedroom and that's $200.

21:54.314 --> 21:55.482
I need to get ready.

22:37.399 --> 22:38.525
You're late.

22:38.609 --> 22:39.735
Can you not?

22:40.569 --> 22:41.570
Here.

22:41.653 --> 22:44.656
Soda. It is poison,
but tonight is special.

22:45.574 --> 22:49.203
These are some of our main benefactors
for the Urban Squash League.

22:49.745 --> 22:51.955
If you screw up, you owe me $50,000.

22:55.167 --> 22:56.460
So, what do I do?

22:56.543 --> 22:58.253
Just mingle, shake hands,

22:58.337 --> 23:00.422
eat a scrumptious sashimi cone.

23:02.174 --> 23:03.300
And if I say something dumb?

23:03.383 --> 23:05.427
If you say something dumb,
don't say it again.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.138
You belong here as much as they do.

23:09.973 --> 23:11.558
Excuse me, I see my ex-lover.

23:22.694 --> 23:23.695
Oyster shooter?

23:24.321 --> 23:26.156
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

23:32.037 --> 23:33.038
Marisol.

23:33.872 --> 23:36.458
We saw you play today.
So many great kills.

23:36.917 --> 23:37.918
Thanks.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.546
-Nice to meet you.
-Now, I don't wanna sway you,

23:40.629 --> 23:43.340
but I could see you
at my alma mater in Cambridge.

23:43.674 --> 23:45.384
Why don't you just say Harvard?

23:46.009 --> 23:47.469
Harvard people always do that.

23:47.553 --> 23:49.471
Well, maybe you're a Stanford girl.

23:49.763 --> 23:52.599
You've been playing such a short time,
and you're already amazing.

23:52.683 --> 23:54.935
You could go anywhere. Duke, Cal.

23:56.520 --> 23:57.729
Maybe I'll go to all of them.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.148
Marisol?

24:01.066 --> 24:02.734
I thought that was you.

24:03.151 --> 24:04.152
Hi.

24:04.236 --> 24:06.029
I had no idea you played squash.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.199
How do you two know each other?

24:13.912 --> 24:15.998
My mom cleans her house.

24:17.499 --> 24:18.625
She's wonderful.

24:19.084 --> 24:20.460
She works really hard.

24:25.215 --> 24:27.968
We love our cleaning lady.
Her name's Renata.

24:33.098 --> 24:35.184
See? It went well. No tears.

24:36.059 --> 24:37.561
I told you. I don't cry.

24:37.978 --> 24:39.354
I'm not talking about you.

24:44.151 --> 24:46.486
This is the one? It's a nice house.

24:49.531 --> 24:50.657
Thanks for the ride.

24:53.035 --> 24:54.077
Oh, and...

24:55.120 --> 24:56.496
I don't live in the house.

25:11.887 --> 25:13.889
How was the party, baby?

25:14.681 --> 25:15.849
Fun.

26:37.848 --> 26:39.141
Hi, Pepita!

26:40.893 --> 26:43.395
Swings. Activate your shoulders.

26:43.478 --> 26:44.771
Okay. My mom is here, so...

26:44.855 --> 26:46.982
And she'll still be here
at the end of the match.

26:47.524 --> 26:49.651
Do you want to greet her as a winner

26:50.319 --> 26:53.697
or as a loser
who forgot to activate shoulders?

26:54.239 --> 26:55.282
You choose.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.002
You look nervous.

27:07.085 --> 27:10.422
How could I not be after that
little pep talk you just gave me?

27:11.715 --> 27:14.676
In the words of the great rapper,

27:15.177 --> 27:16.512
my personal hero,

27:17.387 --> 27:20.766
the RZA, aka Bobby Digital,

27:20.849 --> 27:24.353
"I come for darkness
and lightness will appear.

27:24.978 --> 27:29.399
You got to disappear
through this chamber of fear."

27:39.868 --> 27:40.911
Score, Rosado.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.747
That's my sister out there!

27:43.830 --> 27:47.835
Marisol! Marisol! Marisol!

28:07.312 --> 28:08.564
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

28:08.647 --> 28:09.982
Ref, can I have a let?

28:10.524 --> 28:13.068
Yes, let. Replay the point.
Rosado to serve.

28:13.151 --> 28:15.946
Come on, that was an accident.
I won that point. Are you blind?

28:16.405 --> 28:18.156
Conduct warning to Miss Rosado.

28:18.532 --> 28:20.367
How is that a conduct warning?

28:20.450 --> 28:21.702
You missed the call!

28:21.785 --> 28:25.247
Conduct penalty point to Miss Rosado
for continued verbal abuse.

28:25.330 --> 28:26.748
I didn't abuse you, man!

28:26.832 --> 28:28.417
-Ansley to serve.
-That's bullshit!

28:28.500 --> 28:29.626
Can I have a time-out, please?

28:29.710 --> 28:31.170
-Time-out, please.
-Time-out granted.

28:31.670 --> 28:32.671
Three minutes.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.214
Time-out, Rosado.

28:35.048 --> 28:37.342
-What the hell are you doing?
-Who cares?

28:37.426 --> 28:39.094
They're not gonna let me win anyway.

28:39.178 --> 28:41.722
Who's "them"? The only thing
that matters here is you.

28:41.805 --> 28:43.682
He made a call. You threw a fit.

28:43.765 --> 28:46.518
-You need to focus and get back in there.
-No. I'm not gonna get back in there.

28:46.602 --> 28:48.145
-So, fine, go home and cry?
-Maybe I will!

28:48.228 --> 28:49.229
Hey. Hey!

28:49.980 --> 28:54.234
I told you if you make a bad decision,
there's always an opportunity to fix it.

28:54.318 --> 28:55.944
The ball always comes back.

28:56.028 --> 28:58.572
But that was squash. This is life.

28:59.406 --> 29:01.200
We don't always get another shot.

29:05.954 --> 29:07.372
Marisol,

29:07.956 --> 29:09.541
Marisol...

29:15.297 --> 29:16.465
Come on. Come on.

29:18.717 --> 29:20.344
Ansley, your serve.

30:30.747 --> 30:31.999
Good game.

30:32.082 --> 30:33.250
Yeah, you too.

30:33.750 --> 30:36.545
You're really good.
I'm Charlotte, by the way.

30:37.546 --> 30:39.715
I know. I'm Marisol.

30:40.257 --> 30:42.176
Yeah, I heard your brother
chanting your name.

30:44.761 --> 30:45.929
I'll see you around.

30:47.014 --> 30:48.015
See ya.

30:51.685 --> 30:53.103
Oh, my God! Marisol!

30:53.187 --> 30:56.982
My squash warrior! You were amazing!
Wasn't she?

30:57.065 --> 30:58.066
Hell, yeah!

30:58.150 --> 31:00.235
I am so proud of you.

31:01.320 --> 31:04.239
Why would you be proud of me? I lost.

31:04.823 --> 31:06.366
What do you mean you lost?

31:06.450 --> 31:08.202
You got second place.

31:09.411 --> 31:10.871
You were almost the best!

31:13.582 --> 31:15.209
Oh, Pepita.

31:15.292 --> 31:16.710
Come here, my love.

31:19.046 --> 31:20.130
My love.

31:26.887 --> 31:27.930
Okay.

31:28.305 --> 31:29.556
Ma.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.141
-Gracias, Ma.
-Sí, Pepita.
