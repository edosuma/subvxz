01:16.280 --> 01:17.793
Hi, Mom.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.077
Hi, Bud. How was work?

01:25.040 --> 01:27.713
You know the line on the floor
of the vehicle services office...

01:27.920 --> 01:30.275
...that takes you from the eye test
to the road test?

01:30.520 --> 01:32.272
I like that line.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.918
Well, last week my boss
hired his nephew to repaint it.

01:37.480 --> 01:39.152
- That sounds easy.
- Yeah, sure...

01:39.360 --> 01:42.272
...for those of us who aren't
20 minutes out of rehab.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.873
The glue-meister, however,
decided to paint his line...

01:46.080 --> 01:49.470
...straight from the front door
right to automatic renewals.

01:49.720 --> 01:52.518
I just hope we caught it
before it caused any real damage.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.115
<i>And today on
the Eisenhower Expressway...</i>

01:56.320 --> 01:58.151
<i>...there was a 78 car pile-up...</i>

01:58.360 --> 02:01.750
<i>...caused by a 5-year-old
manning a cement mixer.</i>

02:02.000 --> 02:05.595
<i>The driver, who was identified
only as Timmy, was not arrested...</i>

02:05.800 --> 02:08.951
<i>...because he had
a valid driver's license.</i>

02:11.560 --> 02:13.232
Hey, Peg.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.397
Did you see the horrible news?

02:22.640 --> 02:25.438
Yeah. A 78 car pile-up.

02:26.240 --> 02:29.198
<i>No, not that news. Shoe News.</i>

02:31.120 --> 02:36.240
<i>Shoe News is the only publication that
reaches the entire shoe community.</i>

02:36.600 --> 02:39.239
<i>Well, that and Big 'Uns.</i>

02:40.840 --> 02:42.717
But look,
Luke Ventura got his name...

02:44.080 --> 02:46.753
- ...and his picture in it.
- Who's Luke Ventura?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.560
He's some guy who used to work
with me at Gary's Shoes.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.918
He was always sucking up to the boss
and brownnosing.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.714
He worked overtime,
he was polite to the customers...

02:55.960 --> 02:58.872
...and he actually sold a shoe
from time to time.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.113
Yeah.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.270
But look at the luck
the SOB is having.

03:05.520 --> 03:08.193
Peg, that should be
my picture in there.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.752
Hey, guys.

03:19.360 --> 03:23.353
Guess what we're doing down
at the Larry Storch School of Acting?

03:24.240 --> 03:27.312
Merging with
the Slappy White School of Acting?

03:27.920 --> 03:29.273
Oh, Bud, you're home.

03:29.480 --> 03:32.552
I didn't see your Big Wheels
parked out in the driveway.

03:32.760 --> 03:35.035
Anyway, Larry gave us
this great assignment.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.593
I get to make a movie.

03:37.680 --> 03:41.355
Do the words, "Does Dallas,"
appear anywhere in the title?

03:43.440 --> 03:46.955
Aren't you late for your nightly lurk
around the newsstand or something?

03:51.880 --> 03:57.000
Anyway, Larry says that it's as good
to be behind as well as in front...

04:01.560 --> 04:03.676
...of the camera.

04:03.880 --> 04:06.394
But I can't start my movie
until I have an idea.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.716
Hey, Daddy, do you know anything?

04:09.280 --> 04:13.034
<i>I know that Luke Ventura
is in Shoe News and I'm not.</i>

04:13.520 --> 04:16.637
I should be there and he should
be here being your daddy.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.873
There's no shot of that,
is there, Mom?

04:21.680 --> 04:23.830
Come on, Dad,
you have to know something else.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.349
Pumpkin, I don't have time
to know anything else.

04:26.560 --> 04:30.235
It's a full time job just keeping
the tears in my head.

04:30.880 --> 04:34.270
Now we're a two-job,
no-income family.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.630
I gotta find an idea for my movie.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.068
Movie.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.316
<i>That's it.
That will get me into Shoe News.</i>

04:41.520 --> 04:44.637
A movie about shoes.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.720
If only I had an idea.

04:49.640 --> 04:52.154
If only I had a camera.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.074
If only I had a hammer.

05:01.880 --> 05:06.510
So Al and Kelly actually
made a movie about shoes?

05:06.720 --> 05:10.872
Yeah, but they prefer to call it
a shoe-cumentary.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.758
I'm kind of worried
about Kelly, though.

05:14.960 --> 05:18.032
How is she gonna get to the next
level at the Larry Storch School...

05:18.240 --> 05:19.958
...if she doesn't pass
this assignment?

05:20.160 --> 05:23.948
The Larry Storch School
has a next level?

05:25.240 --> 05:28.994
Yeah, next year
is acting from the waist up.

05:31.280 --> 05:34.192
Great news, Peg.
We just edited our film.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.632
We cut it from eight hours
to a clean three-and-a-half minutes.

05:39.760 --> 05:43.514
Well, seven of those hours we didn't
know the camera was on, so...

05:44.080 --> 05:45.672
Al, may I speak with you in private?

05:45.880 --> 05:47.359
Is this about your rose bushes?

05:47.560 --> 05:50.552
- If it is, I heard a dog barking out there.
- Not that.

05:50.960 --> 05:55.158
How could you use your own daughter
to make a stupid movie about shoes?

05:55.720 --> 05:59.315
Excuse me, Mrs. D'Arcy,
but our shoe movie is not stupid.

05:59.520 --> 06:00.748
It is genius.

06:00.960 --> 06:04.270
We even entered it into
the Hammond Indiana Film Festival.

06:04.720 --> 06:08.759
We're gonna be the biggest show biz
family since Betty and Barry White.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.354
Wait a minute,
that film festival is sponsored by...

06:12.560 --> 06:14.596
...the National Endowment
for the Arts.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.792
They're offering $10,000
to the best film...

06:18.000 --> 06:20.434
...which will be ours.

06:20.640 --> 06:25.634
Al, those grants were intended
for starving and destitute artists.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.831
Well, we are starving.

06:28.840 --> 06:31.115
I'm not a destitute.
I've never taken money for--

06:31.360 --> 06:33.555
Guard the film, pumpkin.

06:36.800 --> 06:41.157
Look, Al, I'll grant you the NEA has
done some silly things in the past...

06:41.360 --> 06:47.230
...but no way, no how, will they accept
a ridiculous movie about shoes.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.671
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

06:50.880 --> 06:55.476
<i>...the world premiere of Shoes.</i>

07:00.640 --> 07:05.953
<i>Shoes is a taut and gripping film
in the Warhol tradition.</i>

07:06.200 --> 07:08.077
Oh, please.

07:08.280 --> 07:12.353
Will the gentleman in the third row
please sit down and stop heckling.

07:16.120 --> 07:20.113
Now you've done it. Now you've gone
and ticked off my husband.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.554
Shut up.

07:27.560 --> 07:32.509
<i>Millions of years ago,
man emerged from the ocean...</i>

07:32.720 --> 07:36.838
<i>...and took his first steps
on dry land.</i>

07:39.240 --> 07:41.390
<i>This of course was to
escape from women...</i>

07:41.600 --> 07:44.160
<i>...and other blood-sucking
sea creatures.</i>

08:03.120 --> 08:05.350
<i>Sheos.</i>

08:06.640 --> 08:07.959
<i>Shoes.</i>

08:08.160 --> 08:13.359
Remember?
E before O except before E-I-E-I-O.

08:44.159 --> 08:47.232
This is beyond redemption.

09:10.840 --> 09:14.230
Peg, is that a yellow M&M
down there on the floor?

09:22.080 --> 09:24.833
Well, I don't see an M&M, Al.

09:26.360 --> 09:30.114
<i>The cave people had to put
something on their feet.</i>

09:30.320 --> 09:32.959
<i>They tried many things.</i>

09:33.160 --> 09:36.038
<i>Tried many things.</i>

09:39.200 --> 09:41.475
<i>Tried many things.</i>

09:44.280 --> 09:46.271
<i>Many things.</i>

09:50.760 --> 09:52.557
Those are my dummies.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.273
Oh, please.

09:55.200 --> 10:00.399
<i>And then one day, legend has it,
the great shoe man in the sky...</i>

10:00.600 --> 10:05.720
<i>...who once scored four touchdowns
in a single game, intervened.</i>

10:06.280 --> 10:09.033
When this is over,
try to stay at least 10 feet from Al...

10:09.240 --> 10:11.959
...that way you won't get hit
by the first burst.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.558
<i>Some claim there was no great
shoe man in the sky.</i>

10:18.760 --> 10:23.436
<i>Others say the answer won't be known
until the other shoe drops.</i>

10:23.640 --> 10:26.279
<i>Rosebud.</i>

10:50.600 --> 10:52.192
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.550
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.792
Bravo.

11:01.720 --> 11:05.793
<i>They won?
Sheos, the movie, actually won?</i>

11:10.640 --> 11:12.710
Yup. First place.

11:12.920 --> 11:18.074
The NEA actually gave Al and Kelly
a cheque for $10,000.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.353
This is an outrage.

11:20.560 --> 11:23.233
That money could have gone
for something much more useful...

11:23.440 --> 11:25.795
...like jailing the homeless.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.516
Well, it's not like it's theirs to waste.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.314
They have to use the money they won
to make another movie.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.278
Another one?

11:34.160 --> 11:39.553
Yeah. But, of course, Al didn't realize
that until he'd spent a $1000 on beer.

11:51.080 --> 11:54.356
Thanks for signing my inner thigh,
Mr. Bundy.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.228
Now, now, Babette...

11:58.440 --> 12:02.877
<i>...we promised not to speak of
such things in front of Les Miserables.</i>

12:07.680 --> 12:12.800
So the NEA actually
gave you $10,000.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.390
They did.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.717
- This is exactly why I'm a Republican.
- Oh, really?

12:18.960 --> 12:23.476
I thought it was because of the drinking
and wife-swapping parties.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.756
That's never been proven.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.198
<i>Al, I thought you did this
to get into Shoe News.</i>

12:32.760 --> 12:34.113
Oh, no, Peg.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.959
<i>No, this is much bigger
than Shoe News.</i>

12:37.160 --> 12:41.119
Well, see, Peg, all my life, I've always
wanted to find something that--

12:41.320 --> 12:43.356
That I was good at.

12:43.800 --> 12:47.918
And the other night in that theater...

12:49.080 --> 12:52.914
...when I heard the applause,
felt the love...

12:53.120 --> 12:56.874
...I knew then what my true calling
would be.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.997
Zoo exhibit?

12:59.880 --> 13:02.110
Cheap and tawdry film.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.237
And if all goes according to plan,
I'll be leaving for Hollywood.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.876
Where when a guy has
a successful film, he leaves the wife.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.988
Hey, Daddy,
I have these storyboards ready.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.514
Good work, pumpkin.

13:18.720 --> 13:22.190
All right, now as you recall,
the name of our new movie...

13:22.400 --> 13:24.675
<i>...is A Day in the Life
of a Shoe Salesman.</i>

13:24.920 --> 13:27.832
Yes, but aren't you gonna start
with the short cartoon...

13:28.040 --> 13:31.510
<i>...A Day in the Sex Life
of a Shoe Salesman?</i>

13:32.960 --> 13:35.793
Oh, I'm really gonna miss you, Peg.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.795
Well, not if I buy a scope.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.837
- Go ahead, pumpkin.
- All right.

13:43.040 --> 13:47.511
Now these stick figures represent what
you go through in the course of a day.

13:55.200 --> 13:59.990
That's good, pumpkin,
but, you know, it just doesn't say Al.

14:00.560 --> 14:03.711
If you shorten that stick there,
it will.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.672
You know, Peg, have I told you today
how much I love you?

14:10.920 --> 14:13.798
- No, Al.
- Okay.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.754
See, pumpkin, what I was saying,
it needs something.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.236
It's too linear and too straight.

14:24.440 --> 14:28.479
Needs bigness. Roundness.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.674
Fullness.

14:37.040 --> 14:40.077
Firmness.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.512
Oh, God, I could die right now.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.909
You would if Mom was here.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.315
Why do we have to be in bikinis,
Mr. Bundy?

14:51.000 --> 14:54.276
My dear, I'm not going to lie to you.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.068
The integrity of the scene
calls for it.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.792
Okay.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.198
That and the crew really loves it.

15:07.480 --> 15:08.913
Daddy? Yeah.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.714
I just finished looking over
your rewrite of the script.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.876
Now granted I'm not here every day...

15:14.080 --> 15:16.674
...but how often do four women
in bikinis...

15:16.880 --> 15:19.440
...just kind of wander on in
to buy shoes?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.070
About as often as the guy
with an IQ of 16...

15:22.280 --> 15:24.589
...gets to meet
a bunch of presidents.

15:25.560 --> 15:26.788
What's your problem?

15:27.760 --> 15:30.354
<i>Daddy, the point is,
is that when we did Sheos...</i>

15:30.560 --> 15:33.677
...we were being true
to our subject and to ourselves.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.030
Now this is not art.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.310
I may not know art,
but I know what I like.

15:49.280 --> 15:51.510
Sorry, ma'am, but we're closed.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.472
Well, how come
they're buying shoes?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.951
Why, look at them.

15:57.000 --> 16:01.710
I see. So if I come back wearing
a bikini, you'll sell me some shoes?

16:01.920 --> 16:05.390
Ma'am, if you get into a bikini,
I'll give you some shoes.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.077
Deal.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.269
Bye-bye.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.829
Al, we gotta hurry.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.714
All right now, girls,
here is the scene.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.434
You're in the shoe store...

16:22.040 --> 16:24.190
...you're laying down.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.919
Why are we laying down?

16:26.120 --> 16:28.998
Well, you're tired.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.952
You've been shopping all day.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.031
That makes perfect sense.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.320
Daddy, what does this have to do
with selling shoes?

16:37.520 --> 16:39.829
Everything. Now go away.

16:43.880 --> 16:45.950
Yo, Bob Rooney here.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.390
Hi, it's me, Ike.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.751
- Hey, Ike. What's up?
- Nothing much.

16:50.960 --> 16:54.430
Hey, listen, I thought of a catch phrase
for the movie poster:

16:54.640 --> 16:57.313
<i>Hasta la vista, shoe man.</i>

16:57.520 --> 16:59.590
Loving it. Loving it.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.109
I'll run it past the big guy.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.392
Excuse me.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.878
- Hello?
- Al.

17:14.079 --> 17:15.354
Ike just called with an idea.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.950
I know, he's right here,
you scrub brush.

17:19.160 --> 17:22.516
What was I thinking of
when I bought you guys phones?

17:22.720 --> 17:25.553
Hey, I didn't get a phone.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.397
All I got was this beeper.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.836
"Call Griff."

17:35.080 --> 17:37.275
- Hey, Al, can I use your phone?
- No!

17:37.480 --> 17:39.835
- I got a--
- No, no, no, no!

17:40.040 --> 17:42.190
Guys, focus, focus!

17:42.400 --> 17:45.278
Places, everyone, places!

17:47.960 --> 17:49.029
<i>A Day in the Life--</i>

17:52.320 --> 17:55.073
<i>A Day in the Life
of a Shoe Salesman, take one.</i>

17:55.680 --> 17:58.797
And action.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.797
Cut!

18:01.400 --> 18:02.833
See, Alderman Kuczxynski.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.395
This is exactly where
our tax money is going...

18:05.640 --> 18:09.519
...to finance stupid films like this
made by idiotic filmmakers like him...

18:09.720 --> 18:11.995
...and Steven Seagal.

18:14.320 --> 18:17.790
Hi, sugar cakes. Remember me?

18:18.480 --> 18:21.278
Sugar cakes is my given name.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.552
Well, aren't you going to stop this?

18:24.760 --> 18:26.193
No, he is not, Marcie.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.870
You see, the NEA gave me money
for me to make a movie of my life.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.957
If you want to see
a movie of your life...

18:32.160 --> 18:35.596
<i>...I suggest you go rent
Rooster Cogburn.</i>

18:38.440 --> 18:40.271
Where did you learn
to light a breast?

18:43.360 --> 18:45.430
That's it. I'm calling Washington.

18:48.840 --> 18:50.319
Bite me.

18:51.320 --> 18:52.548
All right, places, everyone.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.593
Places, please. Places.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.833
<i>A Day in the Life of a Shoe Salesman,
take two.</i>

19:03.040 --> 19:05.110
And action.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.117
I'd like to buy some shoes
and then make love to you.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.514
Fine, but first...

19:17.720 --> 19:21.110
...I must make love
to these three here.

19:22.280 --> 19:25.750
- Hold the phone.
- What is it now?

19:26.200 --> 19:27.918
Daddy, we're selling out.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.991
Now as co-bigwig
on this production...

19:30.200 --> 19:33.158
...I cannot allow this abuse of power
to go on any longer.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.518
- I'm all set, Mr. Bundy.
- Take your place.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.153
Who's that?

19:45.360 --> 19:47.749
He's playing the mall terrorist.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.631
And action.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.029
<i>In local news...</i>

19:54.240 --> 19:59.314
<i>...an 84 car pile-up was caused by
a blind man or his German shepherd...</i>

19:59.520 --> 20:03.195
<i>...one of whom was apparently
driving an ambulance.</i>

20:03.640 --> 20:08.509
<i>Again, no charges were filed
as both had valid driver's licenses.</i>

20:11.800 --> 20:13.518
Hey, family.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.038
Jefferson.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.750
Rhode Island Red.

20:20.520 --> 20:23.159
Do we know yet how much the NEA
loved my movie?

20:23.400 --> 20:24.628
Not yet, Al.

20:24.880 --> 20:28.111
Funny, I sent it in over a month ago,
I wonder what could have happened.

20:28.360 --> 20:32.353
Yeah. They wouldn't treat
Francis Ford Coppertop like that.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.672
Yeah. You know, they're probably
passing it around Washington...

20:35.880 --> 20:38.952
...and Clarence Thomas got ahold of it
and won't give it up.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.272
They burned it, you cretin.

20:41.480 --> 20:44.950
They put on their golf shoes
and jumped up and down on it.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.237
Oh, Al, you know how slowly
the government works.

20:48.440 --> 20:52.592
Remember last year? I didn't get
Marcie's tax refund cheque until June.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.994
I thought you said I owed.

21:01.040 --> 21:04.828
Why does it always
have to be about you?

21:05.720 --> 21:06.948
Look, Daddy, don't worry.

21:07.160 --> 21:09.913
Speaking as a student
of the Larry Storch School of Acting...

21:10.120 --> 21:12.873
...I can guarantee you
that the NEA is gonna love it.

21:13.120 --> 21:17.955
<i>Today in the first unanimous decision
by Congress in 105 years...</i>

21:18.160 --> 21:22.836
<i>...the NEA has been dismantled
due to their sponsorship of the film...</i>

21:23.040 --> 21:26.271
...A Day in the Life
of a Shoe Salesman.

21:33.640 --> 21:34.993
Didn't you hear the news, Dad?

21:35.240 --> 21:36.832
Yup.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.233
Then why are you smiling?

21:39.520 --> 21:41.476
Why, Peg?

21:41.680 --> 21:44.194
Because it doesn't
matter anymore, see?

21:44.400 --> 21:47.153
