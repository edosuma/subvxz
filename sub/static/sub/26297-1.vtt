00:01.735 --> 00:03.771
ADULT ADAM:
Growing up as a kid
in the '80s, I loved movies.

00:03.837 --> 00:05.706
Not just making them,
living them,

00:05.773 --> 00:08.076
from unforgettable classics
like "Ghostbusters"

00:08.142 --> 00:10.578
to the action-packed saga
of "The Karate Kid."

00:10.644 --> 00:12.513
But my all-time faves
were the movies

00:12.580 --> 00:14.248
from legendary director
John Hughes.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.150
I got weird like
"Weird Science,"

00:16.217 --> 00:18.252
had an epic day off
like Ferris,

00:18.319 --> 00:20.221
even joined
The Breakfast Club.

00:20.288 --> 00:22.590
But on my 16th birthday,
no movie felt truer

00:22.656 --> 00:25.893
than the John Hughes
masterpiece "Sixteen Candles."

00:25.959 --> 00:29.163
You need 4 inches of bod
and a great birthday.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.565
ADULT ADAM: Lucky for me,
I had all the bod I needed.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.867
In fact, this birthday
was gonna rock.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.569
I can't believe this.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.571
They  forgot
my birthday.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.307
Oof.
That's gotta sting.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.475
ADULT ADAM: Yep, my mom
always remembered.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.477
Birthday boy sighting!

00:43.544 --> 00:45.779
Ah!
There's my little
birthday Schmoo.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.615
Happy birthday, Schmoo.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.617
ADULT ADAM:
And when it came
to my birthday,

00:49.683 --> 00:51.185
I got all the attention,

00:51.252 --> 00:53.121
until the year I didn't.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.356
You are not getting married
to Lainey Lewis.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.958
You are a high-school senior
and a tiny boy.

00:58.025 --> 00:59.127
And you need a job!

00:59.193 --> 01:01.795
First, you drop out of college
to be a rock star?

01:01.862 --> 01:04.898
Now you're back here
driving up my electric bill!

01:04.965 --> 01:07.368
You will get married
over my dead body.

01:07.435 --> 01:10.771
And shame on you
for not even consulting

01:10.838 --> 01:13.674
your one true lady love
of your life, which is me.

01:13.741 --> 01:14.842
And look at you.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.111
Using my stove
and my light bulbs

01:17.178 --> 01:19.513
like you're some sort
of Norwegian royalty.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.382
You can't be a husband.

01:21.449 --> 01:23.117
You are still
my baby Barry.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.952
Those beautiful
blond bastards!

01:25.018 --> 01:27.155
They did nothing to help us
during the war.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.022
Murray, stop.
You're on a bad tangent.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.791
Just focus on how
she's breaking our hearts.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.394
Um, sorry to interrupt
your morning rage-a-thon,

01:33.461 --> 01:35.563
but does anyone have anything
they want to say to me?

01:35.629 --> 01:36.830
Not everything's
about you,

01:36.897 --> 01:38.466
golden child
who can do no wrong.

01:38.532 --> 01:41.135
Really?
Nothing else?

01:41.202 --> 01:42.870
Ow!
That thing has walnuts!

01:42.936 --> 01:44.305
Oh, Adam,
I almost forgot.

01:44.372 --> 01:45.406
ADULT ADAM:
I knew she'd remember.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.940
It was birthday gift time.

01:47.007 --> 01:49.177
I bet it's that fancy
editing machine I wanted.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.778
Here's $3.

01:50.844 --> 01:53.547
I was so busy crying
about your brother
taking a child bride

01:53.614 --> 01:54.882
that I didn't
make you a lunch.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.017
It's shepherd's pie
at the cafeteria today!

01:57.084 --> 01:58.519
That's the worst of
all savory pies.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.422
And no bananas till you make
a poop-ila in the pot-ila.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.224
But what about my...

02:03.291 --> 02:05.993
ADULT ADAM:
Turns out, I really was living
"Sixteen Candles" after all.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.428
I can't believe this.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.929
They
forgot my birthday.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.032
* I'm twisted up inside

02:12.099 --> 02:15.269
* But nonetheless,
I feel the need to say

02:17.971 --> 02:19.440
* I don't know the future

02:19.507 --> 02:23.211
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:23.277 --> 02:25.813
It was September 26,
1980-something.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.349
Barry was happily engaged,
but no one was angrier

02:28.416 --> 02:29.517
than his future father-in-law.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.985
Hey, Billy boy.
Here to yell at the kids?

02:32.052 --> 02:33.887
Bingo!
Hope it's okay,

02:33.954 --> 02:36.056
but I've written some
really terrible things

02:36.123 --> 02:38.226
to say to Barry in order
to scare him off.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.928
You did some homework.
Good on you.
Yeah.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.931
Full disclosure...
I attack his
physical appearance

02:43.997 --> 02:45.866
in a very unchristian way.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.835
I mean, it's no way

02:47.901 --> 02:49.570
for an adult to speak
to a child.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.539
Hey, go big
or go home, right?

02:51.605 --> 02:52.740
Wrong!

02:52.806 --> 02:54.275
All of our anger, guilt,

02:54.342 --> 02:56.877
and emotional terror
only makes
the kids dig in deeper.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.646
We have to rethink
our tactics.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.549
With your blessing,
I am willing
to fistfight your son.

03:01.615 --> 03:04.218
I mean,
something like this.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.286
An open house?

03:05.353 --> 03:07.187
The Goodmans down the street
are moving.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.257
I think it's time
I show those kids

03:09.323 --> 03:11.959
the harsh realities
of being actual adults.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.196
And we can put a samurai sword
on this wall.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.198
Shark tank, shark tank,
shark tank.

03:18.266 --> 03:19.900
Boom!
Seven more shark tanks!

03:19.967 --> 03:21.635
Bar, where am I gonna hang
all my guitars

03:21.702 --> 03:24.137
if every wall is full
of swords and sharks?
You're right.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.774
Mom, we're gonna need
a bigger, wall-ier house,

03:26.840 --> 03:28.976
but we appreciate the offer
to buy us this one.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.611
Oh, I'm not buying you
this house.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.945
I brought you here
to show you

03:32.012 --> 03:33.947
how much it would cost you
to buy it.

03:34.014 --> 03:36.617
$37,000?
Are you friggin' kidding me?

03:36.684 --> 03:38.151
We can't afford that.
We're just dumb kids!

03:38.218 --> 03:39.253
Exactly.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.622
You're kids without
degrees or jobs.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.425
You're not ready
to take on this kind
of adult responsibility.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.794
Okay, so maybe we can't
afford this house

03:46.860 --> 03:48.696
with its embarrassing
number of walls.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.332
All that matters is
I'm crazy in love
with this girl right here.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.334
Aw, my big,
hairy monster.

03:53.401 --> 03:54.668
We can live in some tiny,

03:54.735 --> 03:56.937
shark-tankless apartment,
for all I care.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.806
As long as it's me,
Lainey,

03:58.872 --> 04:00.374
and our four snuggly
little kids.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.942
Okay, there is no way
I'm gonna let y...

04:02.009 --> 04:03.444
Oh, my God.
Did you say kids?

04:03.511 --> 04:05.913
Can you imagine all those cute
little Barrys running around?

04:05.979 --> 04:06.980
Aww.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.350
Aww.
Aww.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.551
Why is she aww-ing
with us?

04:10.618 --> 04:12.520
I don't know.
Little Barrys.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.187
Oh, with the curly hair

04:14.254 --> 04:16.790
and the squishy,
husky baby body

04:16.857 --> 04:18.826
and the not being able
to ride the bus to camp

04:18.892 --> 04:20.961
'cause you're so emotionally
out of control.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.563
Ah!

04:22.630 --> 04:25.265
ADULT ADAM: In that moment,
Lainey discovered my mom's

04:25.333 --> 04:28.135
one true weakness...
the promise of grandkids.

04:28.201 --> 04:29.503
That's right!

04:29.570 --> 04:31.905
Can you imagine all those
cuddly little baby Barrys?

04:31.972 --> 04:34.274
I'm imagining it
so hard right now.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.476
That's good!

04:35.543 --> 04:37.511
But the only way to get them
is to get us married.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.680
Oh, no, you're not
getting married.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.649
But... But how soon
could you get married

04:41.715 --> 04:42.750
and give me
little Barrys?

04:42.816 --> 04:44.585
What are we even
talking about right now?

04:44.652 --> 04:46.286
Bar, we're talking about
the sooner we get married,

04:46.354 --> 04:47.721
the sooner your mom
becomes a grammy.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.924
Bubby. Oh, I want to be
a bubby so bad!

04:50.991 --> 04:53.927
Oh!
Now I get it.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.196
Would literally kill
my friends with envy.

04:56.263 --> 04:57.998
That's my dream.
Yes.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.034
This is very exciting,
but let's manage expectations.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.503
This baby thing
is a ways off.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.737
Yeah,
it could be decades.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.172
But it'll for sure
happen one day.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.040
Oh,
one day is so close.

05:07.107 --> 05:09.843
Oh, I can almost taste
the baby in my mouth.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.412
Muh-muh-muh.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.146
Oh!
That's a tasty baby.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.515
Oh, I'm gonna
eat your foot.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.419
Baby foot
is my favorite!

05:18.486 --> 05:21.154
I'm gonna put ketchup
on the baby foot.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.392
Told you I could get her
on board.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.494
Although I may have concerns
she wants to eat our baby.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.328
Come on.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.764
Wait. They all forgot
your birthday?

05:30.831 --> 05:32.366
I always thought
"Sixteen Candles"

05:32.433 --> 05:33.967
was a delightful
comedic premise,

05:34.034 --> 05:36.169
but when it happens to you,
it's more shocking
and hurtful.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.805
Well, your family
may not love you at all,

05:37.871 --> 05:38.872
but guess who does.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.442
Man, you guys just get me.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.710
Even if that
isn't my locker.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.412
Wazzat?

05:44.478 --> 05:47.347
Who put this old green talking
puppet dog on my locker?

05:47.415 --> 05:48.616
It's Yoda.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.618
How do you not know Yoda?
He's awesome.

05:50.684 --> 05:54.955
But I refuse to find
common ground with you turds.

05:55.022 --> 05:58.091
And here I thought this year,
we might actually find our way
out of the social basement.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.894
Wait! Maybe you living
"Sixteen Candles" can help us.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.596
You're finally under
your parents' radar.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.965
Let's use this chance to throw
a big-ass birthday rager.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.200
Come on. We have no idea
how to throw a rager.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.637
Lucky for you,
John Hughes already taught us.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.373
We're gonna relive
all of the classic

06:13.441 --> 06:15.008
"Sixteen Candles"
party moments.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.845
Like what?
I'm talking
beer-can pyramid.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.580
Pizza on the record player.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.281
Irreparable house damage!

06:21.348 --> 06:23.316
Somehow, foam
gets in your vents.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.852
Toilet paper trees.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.219
And, obviously,

06:26.286 --> 06:28.489
a dweeb will be imprisoned
in your glass coffee table.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.491
But what about...
Long Duk Dong?

06:30.558 --> 06:32.760
No! There will be
no discussion
of the Donger.

06:32.826 --> 06:36.329
I'm trying to...
Say he's hilarious?
Well, he's not.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.466
Get off your totally warranted
soapbox, Dave Kim.

06:38.532 --> 06:39.767
I'm trying to say
I'm in.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.769
Sweet!
So, where do we begin?

06:41.835 --> 06:44.872
No clue, but I do know
the coolest person alive

06:44.938 --> 06:47.307
who knows everything about
throwing a badass bash.

06:47.374 --> 06:48.476
BOTH: Erica.

06:48.542 --> 06:49.677
Better.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.513
You want a birthday rager,
kiddo?

06:52.580 --> 06:54.715
I'll throw you one
that'll make you plotz.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.817
Sweet!
So, whatcha thinking?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.652
We pull out
all the stops.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.755
I'm talking martinis,
dollar stogies, fan dancers.

07:01.822 --> 07:05.759
Ooh. I got an in with
the Shorty Flanders Trio.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.628
Yeah,
we'll go to Erica.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.997
ADULT ADAM:
And so I turned to my sister
for an electrifying rager.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.865
But turns out Erica
was dealing with

07:11.932 --> 07:13.501
some electrifying issues
of her own.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.002
For the love of crap!

07:15.068 --> 07:16.504
I just got
the electricity bill,

07:16.570 --> 07:17.971
and my dad is
gonna kill me.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.673
Okay, calm down.
I'm sure it's not that bad.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.241
It's $906.

07:21.308 --> 07:22.776
"For the love of crap"
is right!

07:22.843 --> 07:24.478
That's so bad
and so wasteful!

07:24.545 --> 07:26.480
Excuse you.
How am I wasteful?

07:26.547 --> 07:28.315
Oh, I don't know. Maybe
'cause you and your drummer

07:28.381 --> 07:30.450
have incredibly indulgent
energy needs?

07:30.518 --> 07:33.053
Uh, we have to run
the A/C and fans 24/7

07:33.120 --> 07:35.255
'cause our tons of equipment
runs, like, super hot.

07:35.322 --> 07:36.824
Yeah, but do you really
need the sign?

07:36.890 --> 07:38.792
Do you not want people
to know the name of our band,

07:38.859 --> 07:40.160
unsupportive Geoff?

07:40.227 --> 07:41.461
Look, your dad
is gonna kill you.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.096
My dad's gonna kill me.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.898
I'm gonna be
the most hated kid
in this house,

07:44.965 --> 07:47.334
even more than Barry,
and he's a high-school groom.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.402
Okay, all we gotta do
is come up with a mature,

07:49.469 --> 07:51.471
adult way to solve this.
Erica!

07:51.539 --> 07:53.807
I need your help to throw
a reckless high-school party

07:53.874 --> 07:55.342
that Mom and Dad
can never know about.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.110
I'll do it.
Seriously?

07:57.177 --> 07:59.747
For my special guy?
Of course.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.883
Throwing a party is incredibly
risky, and if you get caught,

08:02.950 --> 08:05.085
Mom and Dad will be livid,
and you'll be the worst kid

08:05.152 --> 08:07.087
in the house, not me.
No, no, I get it.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.956
I can't believe
you'll throw me a party.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.258
I thought you forgot
all about today.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.661
I don't totally follow,
but I'm on it.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.563
First, I'll get Mom and Dad
out of town

08:15.629 --> 08:18.365
so they won't return tonight
and catch you red-handed.

08:18.431 --> 08:20.768
No, I get it.
High school's gonna
be as awesome for me

08:20.834 --> 08:22.202
as it was for you.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.237
Thank you, Erica.
Don't mention it.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.406
This timing could not
be more perfect.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.742
No need to look my direction.
I know what's happening.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.978
ADULT ADAM: With that,
my legendary party was on.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.113
As for my dad and Bill,
they were praying

08:33.180 --> 08:35.282
Barry and Lainey's
wedding was off.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.117
There's our mad genius.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.219
Did the kids finally learn
how terrible marriage is?

08:39.286 --> 08:41.855
Better.
I'm gonna be a bubalah,

08:41.922 --> 08:44.124
which means we gotta get
those kids married right away

08:44.191 --> 08:45.893
so I can get me
a tasty baby.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.527
A baby?

08:47.595 --> 08:49.396
What kind of backwards,
mixed-up talk

08:49.462 --> 08:50.731
did you have
with those kids?

08:50.798 --> 08:51.999
All right,
don't get all worked up.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.801
It's not gonna happen
right away.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.002
We ran the numbers.

08:55.068 --> 08:58.639
It'll be anywhere from 10
to three to two years.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.474
No!
Hey, what ever happened
to the Bevolution?

09:01.541 --> 09:03.476
You know, finding your way
without our kids?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.713
I hereby suspend
the Bevolution.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.414
Viva la Bubby-lution!

09:07.480 --> 09:09.817
You can't just put "lution"
at the end of a word

09:09.883 --> 09:12.085
and make it be a thing.
Oh, it's a thing.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.721
And since we're all
so excited about it,

09:13.787 --> 09:15.455
we should go out
and celebrate.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.958
You know the best place
to celebrate whatever's
happening here?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.459
Atlantic City.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.762
It's far enough to get away,
but close enough
to be home by 10:00

09:21.829 --> 09:23.664
and see what's happening
here at the house. Okay, bye!

09:23.731 --> 09:26.299
Yes.
Atlantic City.

09:26.366 --> 09:30.270
That is the perfect place
to honor this joyous
baby engagement.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.106
What the hell
just happened?

09:33.173 --> 09:35.342
She was supposed to scare 'em
off with an open house,

09:35.408 --> 09:37.444
and now we're eating
in another state!

09:37.510 --> 09:38.979
I'll tell you
what just happened.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.814
Our moron kids
are brilliant.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.582
They used the baby card
against us.

09:42.650 --> 09:43.784
I hate the baby card.

09:43.851 --> 09:45.352
Also,
what's the baby card?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.320
I'm so scared and upset,
Murray!

09:47.387 --> 09:49.857
Why, hello,
angry fathers.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.458
Guess who just got
Beverly Goldberg

09:51.524 --> 09:52.693
on board
the wedding train.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.261
Do you know
what a can of worms

09:54.327 --> 09:57.665
you two just opened
by promising
that yenta grandbabies?

09:57.731 --> 09:59.299
Face it, you lost.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.969
Now that Mom's excited
about our foolishly
impulsive wedding,

10:02.035 --> 10:03.303
you have to accept it.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.805
The curly-haired
sack of flour's right.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.007
Beverly Goldberg
always gets her way.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.209
But at what cost?
BEVERLY: Yoo-hoo!

10:09.276 --> 10:10.978
Look at all this
adorable stuff I've had

10:11.044 --> 10:12.813
hermetically sealed
in the garage.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.481
You're gonna need this,
for sure.

10:14.547 --> 10:15.783
It's Barry's baby helmet.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.117
Yay!
Great.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.551
Not only are we
having a baby,

10:18.618 --> 10:20.821
but its head's gonna be
all cattywampus.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.322
Cheese and crackers.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.324
Ooh, look at this sign!
Aww!

10:24.391 --> 10:25.693
I'm gonna put it in
the station wagon

10:25.759 --> 10:27.895
for our trip to AC.
No need!

10:27.961 --> 10:30.197
After all, there is literally
no baby on board.

10:30.263 --> 10:33.834
Not yet. But there
is a bubby on board.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.502
ADULT ADAM: With Bubby
officially on board,

10:35.568 --> 10:37.504
it was Atlantic City or bust!

10:37.570 --> 10:39.206
Nothing could stop them.

10:39.272 --> 10:42.042
Meanwhile, my big birthday
rager was off with a bang.

10:42.109 --> 10:44.177
It had all the highlights
from "Sixteen Candles,"

10:44.244 --> 10:46.714
but I discovered
when it's your house,

10:46.780 --> 10:48.581
it's not nearly as fun.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.250
Check us out!

10:50.317 --> 10:53.687
We're fancy, big-haired
ladies, like your mom.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.889
ADULT ADAM:
Just when I thought no more
damage could be done...

10:58.091 --> 10:59.693
...actual damage was done.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.162
Oh, man.
Bench press got away from me.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.430
That's my bad, Alden.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.866
My name's Adam,
and your weightlifting mishap

11:05.933 --> 11:08.736
just caused major
structural damage to my home.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.939
There's a throw rug up here.
I'll chuck it over the hole.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.542
Why did John Hughes make this
seem so whimsical and fun?

11:15.608 --> 11:17.945
Help me!
I'm a human person!

11:18.011 --> 11:20.848
Even Long Duk Dong
had more dignity than this!

11:22.682 --> 11:25.753
ADULT ADAM:
The engagement celebration in
Atlantic City was under way,

11:25.819 --> 11:27.921
but Lainey's dad
wasn't feeling so lucky.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.790
Dealer has 21 again.
Why?

11:29.857 --> 11:32.192
Better save some money
for the wedding, Bill.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.227
In that case,
I'd like to go all-in.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.796
Well, his day's about
to get a lot better,

11:35.863 --> 11:37.898
because look what I bought
in the gift shop.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.666
Oh, wow.
That's for a baby,

11:39.733 --> 11:41.468
which is weird
'cause we were very clear

11:41.534 --> 11:42.803
that's a long,
long way off.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.504
But we blink,
and then baby's here,

11:44.571 --> 11:46.673
and then there I am,
right next to you
on my mom cot.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.242
Mom cot?
Oh, no, not the mom cot.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.610
What does he know?
What's a mom cot?

11:50.677 --> 11:53.113
It is a cot that sits
smack against your bed

11:53.180 --> 11:56.216
so when you get tired,
you just hand the baby
directly to me.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.485
Wait. You actually expect
to sleep in the same room
with us?

11:58.551 --> 12:00.320
Trust me, you'll be thrilled
to have a bed bubby

12:00.387 --> 12:03.456
when it comes time
for burping,
bathing, and poopy diapies.

12:03.523 --> 12:04.825
No way, Mother.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.459
You are never to set foot
in our hypothetical home!

12:06.526 --> 12:08.161
I have a copy of the key,
right, Murray?

12:08.228 --> 12:09.462
She made a secret copy.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.898
Barry,
can we chat outside?

12:10.964 --> 12:12.699
I need some fresh air
right now.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.567
Dealer has 21.

12:14.634 --> 12:17.504
I lost two grand,
and it's still the best thing
that happened to me today.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.706
ADULT ADAM:
Bill wasn't the only one
on a losing streak.

12:19.773 --> 12:23.110
I had completely lost control
of my epic party
I no longer wanted.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.345
Yo! There's the host
with the most.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.114
Hope you're digging
your kick-ass party.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.016
For sure, but also,
I don't want the party.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.084
What?
Take the party!
It's your party.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.020
You asked for the party,
so the party's yours.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.855
Come on. We all know
it's your party.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.357
He's right, Erica.
General consensus is,
it's your party.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.826
No, no, that can't be
the narrative.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.194
It is very important
that this is
clearly designated

12:41.261 --> 12:42.729
as Adam's party.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.465
Hey, everyone,
let's give it up
for the one person

12:45.532 --> 12:48.368
who we all know is definitely
throwing this party.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.437
We love you,
Alden Goldfinch!

12:50.503 --> 12:52.672
Alden.

12:52.739 --> 12:55.442
See? They're almost
chanting your name.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.010
Enjoy your party.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.081
You're the man, Alden.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.551
Okay, your mom is really
freaking me out

13:04.617 --> 13:06.854
with her cute onesies
and "Baby On Board" signs

13:06.920 --> 13:09.189
and celebratory
casino buffets.

13:09.256 --> 13:11.324
I'm sorry, but this
can't be my life!
What are you saying?

13:11.391 --> 13:13.393
I'm saying I love you,
but having Beverly Goldberg

13:13.460 --> 13:15.162
as a smother-in-law
will be an utter nightmare.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.998
No! Don't trust
your instincts!

13:18.065 --> 13:20.167
Come on.
A romantic pushcart ride

13:20.233 --> 13:23.570
will remind you at the end of
the day, it's just you and me.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.605
There's my sweet
little lovebirds.

13:25.672 --> 13:27.074
Gah! She found us.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.842
Come on.
Scoot your booties.
Ow.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.544
You've got to try
some of this delicious taffy.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.613
Can't do it.
Where's she going?

13:33.680 --> 13:35.748
I can't finish this taffy
all by myself.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.317
Forget the taffy!

13:37.384 --> 13:39.887
You literally just drove away
the love of my life.

13:39.953 --> 13:43.623
Don't worry. Mama will talk to
her, and I'll fix everything.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.358
There is no fixing this.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.194
And it's not just Lainey.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.595
Any girl I date
will realize

13:48.661 --> 13:50.530
you're part of the package
and run for the hills.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.733
So, you're saying that I will
shake the foundation

13:53.800 --> 13:55.368
of all my kids'
relationships

13:55.435 --> 13:57.070
just 'cause I wanna be
a little bit involved?

13:57.137 --> 13:58.505
Is that what
you're saying?
Yes.

13:58.571 --> 14:01.608
Mark my words...
I will never have babies,

14:01.674 --> 14:03.443
which means you'll
never be a bubby.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.978
Don't you dare
un-bubby me.

14:05.045 --> 14:08.916
Oh, you've been un-bubbied
but good.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.717
ADULT ADAM: As Barry
was ditching my mom,

14:10.783 --> 14:13.753
I was ditching my own party
to have some real fun.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.288
What the hell, man?

14:15.355 --> 14:16.957
Seriously, what am I
looking at right now?

14:17.024 --> 14:19.559
The adventurous board game
Fireball Island.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.929
No, I mean you made
a designated nerd area

14:21.995 --> 14:23.463
in the middle
of your awesome party.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.932
Yes, and it's your party.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.633
Not according
to this sign.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.236
Here, tape it
to your chest.
No, thank you.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.204
I'd rather just hang
with my actual friends

14:31.271 --> 14:32.872
who know my actual name.

14:32.940 --> 14:35.575
You can't just beg me
to throw you an awesome rager
and then give it back.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.644
Okay,
I didn't beg you.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.379
You did it
'cause it's my gift.

14:39.446 --> 14:40.680
Gift

14:40.747 --> 14:44.584
* Happy birthday to you

14:44.651 --> 14:48.621
* Happy birthday to you

14:48.688 --> 14:52.425
* Happy birthday, dear Alden

14:52.492 --> 14:54.127
* Adam

14:54.194 --> 14:57.797
* Happy birthday to you *

14:57.864 --> 15:00.700
Oh, I wish I had that
information before
I did what I did.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.336
What did you do?
What didn't I do?

15:03.403 --> 15:04.637
This is gonna tickle you.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.406
I may have, uh,

15:06.473 --> 15:09.776
set you up to distract
Dad from my irresponsible
energy usage.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.945
What?
I didn't know
it was your birthday,

15:12.012 --> 15:14.447
so if anything, it's on you
for having big secrets.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.950
This is not a regular cake,
you know.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.185
This thing melts.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.686
How could you do this?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.688
The one thing I wanted
was to be awesome

15:21.754 --> 15:23.223
like you were
in high school.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.192
Now all I'll be
is some dude named Alden

15:25.258 --> 15:26.493
who's grounded
for the year.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.996
I messed up, okay?
I'll make it all better.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.131
I promise, you can still be
awesome just like me.

15:31.198 --> 15:34.301
No. The last thing I'd ever
want is to be some selfish,

15:34.367 --> 15:36.469
drop-out loser like you.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.538
You don't mean that.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.207
I really do.

15:45.845 --> 15:48.215
Adam!
Come on, open up.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.749
Yeah, little nerd, open up!

15:50.450 --> 15:52.219
This party sucks!

15:52.285 --> 15:54.387
ADULT ADAM:
After our mom had destroyed
Barry's engagement,

15:54.454 --> 15:56.523
he figured he didn't have
anything else to lose.

15:56.589 --> 16:00.460
Evening.
I'd like a root beer
and a marker for $10,000.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.996
Nice try, moron. You're not
old enough to be in here.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.797
Yeah, old enough to steal
my little princess

16:04.864 --> 16:06.866
and saddle her with
a crooked-headed infant.

16:06.933 --> 16:09.036
Actually, Lainey bolted.
She's gone for good.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.638
Hot diggity-dog!
I'm the luckiest man alive!

16:11.704 --> 16:13.106
I just lost
so much money,

16:13.173 --> 16:15.075
but I'm walking on sunshine
over here!

16:15.142 --> 16:16.809
Wait a second.
Lainey's gone?

16:16.876 --> 16:18.845
Mom ran her off
with her terrible ways.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.847
I'll help you find her.
Help him?

16:20.913 --> 16:22.515
We're on
the one-yard line, Mur.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.685
I'm sorry, but if Barry's
gonna break up with Lainey,

16:25.752 --> 16:27.520
it's gonna be
because he's a moron,

16:27.587 --> 16:29.756
not because his mom
is an overbearing nudge.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.891
You really believe I can
screw this up on my own?

16:31.958 --> 16:33.426
I know you can.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.496
Now let's go find Lainey
and make this
temporarily right.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.531
No, Mur, no!
We're so close!

16:38.598 --> 16:40.533
Double zeroes!
We got a big winner.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.202
Not now!
I'm in a crisis here!

16:43.203 --> 16:44.704
Please, open up!

16:44.771 --> 16:47.074
This ponytail is the source
of all my power!

16:47.140 --> 16:49.442
Close your eyes.
I got this.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.286
I love you.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.722
Ew. You're not hot
anymore.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.624
Adam, I'm coming in.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.726
Oh, come on!

17:06.793 --> 17:08.861
Who am I now?
I'm hideous!

17:08.928 --> 17:10.397
Little trick
I learned in college.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.266
Well, I locked my door
for a reason. Go away.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.435
Not until you accept
my apology.

17:15.502 --> 17:16.936
Why?
You don't mean it.

17:17.003 --> 17:19.106
You just feel awful
for trying to destroy me

17:19.172 --> 17:21.141
with an evil plan
on my birthday.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.742
Sure.

17:22.809 --> 17:26.579
But I also feel awful
because what you said
was true.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.581
All I am
is a college dropout

17:28.648 --> 17:31.718
who lives at home
and mooches off
of her parents.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.721
I act like
I'm so cool and like
I have it all figured out,

17:34.787 --> 17:36.556
but you're right.

17:36.623 --> 17:37.724
I'm just a loser.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.360
No. I don't really think that.

17:40.427 --> 17:43.930
Truth is, all I've ever wanted
to be is just like you.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.332
Really?
Yes!

17:45.398 --> 17:47.334
I stupidly idolize you.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.203
I'd love to be cool
and have people know my name

17:50.270 --> 17:53.506
and have one year of school
be as epic as yours was.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.975
Well, it is your birthday.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.645
So I'm on it.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.347
For real this time.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.650
ADULT ADAM: And so
my sister gave me the greatest
birthday gift of all

18:03.716 --> 18:05.852
a small taste
of high-school popularity.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.356
It may not have been
your typical rager,
but it was mine.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.624
And it was awesome.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.227
'Cause for that one night,
everyone knew my name.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.095
Turns out John Hughes
was right,

18:16.163 --> 18:19.132
turning 16 was a lot sweeter
than I thought.

18:19.199 --> 18:22.034
Meanwhile, Lainey had soured
on her future with Barry.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.171
Barry, please.
I'm done talking.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.838
Well, then,
just listen, 'cause,

18:25.905 --> 18:27.474
my dad has something
he wants to say.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.511
If you're here
to call us morons
for getting married,

18:31.578 --> 18:33.346
there's no need,
'cause it's not gonna happen.

18:33.413 --> 18:36.183
You really think I'm gonna
walk through the sand

18:36.249 --> 18:39.586
with my bad foot
just to call you a moron?

18:39.652 --> 18:42.689
Look, if you really
love each other,

18:42.755 --> 18:44.257
there's nothing
you can't survive.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.193
Even the world's worst
smother

18:46.259 --> 18:47.360
Yes.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.028
Because at the end
of the day,

18:49.095 --> 18:52.532
I know Beverly Goldberg
can stay away
when it really matters.

18:52.599 --> 18:56.035
And I know it's scary
to think of her on your back,

18:56.102 --> 18:59.206
but that also means
that she has your back.

18:59.272 --> 19:01.541
And trust me,
there's no better feeling.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.142
I thought you wanted us
to break up.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.344
Why are you
trying to help?

19:04.411 --> 19:05.745
Because that's
what families do,

19:05.812 --> 19:08.748
and like it or not,
you're always gonna be family.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.417
ADULT ADAM:
And so, thanks to my dad...

19:10.483 --> 19:11.818
Come on.

19:11.884 --> 19:14.086
...Lainey decided to give
Barry another shot.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.922
This time,
just the two of them.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.089
Oh!

19:17.624 --> 19:19.292
Hey.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.461
What are you guys doing?

19:21.528 --> 19:22.995
Really not helping, Mom.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.364
You're terrible.

19:24.431 --> 19:25.598
It's true.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.534
Look, I know
I got carried away.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.168
It's just...

19:29.236 --> 19:33.640
All my babies grew up
and don't need me anymore.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.576
But you made me realize
it's not fully over.

19:36.643 --> 19:39.846
I still have a whole new
chapter left... One day.

19:39.912 --> 19:43.483
Well, when it does happen,
I hope you're there with me.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.751
On a mom cot?

19:44.817 --> 19:45.885
Mom!
Bevy.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.720
We'll figure it out.
We have time.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.224
You'd think,
but it just goes so fast.

19:51.291 --> 19:54.327
And it seems
like only yesterday
I was in the hospital

19:54.394 --> 19:57.797
holding my little Adam in my
arms for the first time and...

19:57.864 --> 20:00.032
Holy crap!
We forgot his birthday!

20:00.099 --> 20:01.868
We forgot Adam's birthday!

20:01.934 --> 20:03.436
This is gonna be
a whole thing.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.905
Go, go! Go!

20:05.972 --> 20:08.441
ADULT ADAM: Yeah, it wasn't
the birthday I expected,

20:08.508 --> 20:11.278
and I didn't get the fancy
editing machine I'd hoped for,

20:11.344 --> 20:15.147
but in the end,
I got something much better.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.449
Whatcha doin'?

20:16.516 --> 20:18.885
Figured if I was gonna
have a "Sixteen Candles"

20:18.951 --> 20:21.588
kind of birthday, I might
as well see it through.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.823
Well?
Did you make a wish?

20:23.890 --> 20:27.260
It already came true.
This year's gonna be awesome.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.695
ADULT ADAM:
Little did I know,

20:28.761 --> 20:31.498
this year really would be
one I'd never forget.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.466
Mama's here, Schmoo!

20:33.533 --> 20:36.903
I am so, so sorry
I forgot your birthday.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.605
No!
Don't get on the table!

20:38.671 --> 20:39.906
I will never
forgive myself...

20:42.241 --> 20:43.443
Was that your wish?

20:45.745 --> 20:49.081
* Happy birthday, dear Adam

20:49.148 --> 20:51.884
* Happy birthday to you *

20:51.951 --> 20:53.185
Hooray!

20:53.252 --> 20:54.787
I hate to ask you
what you wished for.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.023
Probably $3,000 worth
of editing equipment.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.994
Happy belated birthday, bro!

21:02.061 --> 21:04.564
I forgot to give you your gift
of one butt-crack busting

21:04.631 --> 21:05.732
sub-atomic wedgie.

21:05.798 --> 21:07.567
Sure, just do me a favor

21:07.634 --> 21:09.702
and back up a bit so you
can get a running start.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.170
You've learned
to not struggle.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.373
I see much growth
since last year.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.909
Yep, one year really
has made me wiser.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.978
Wha? Oh, my God.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.146
What's happening?

21:20.212 --> 21:21.881
Help! I'm shrinking!

21:25.251 --> 21:26.453
Better luck next year.
