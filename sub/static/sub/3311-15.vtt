WEBVTT

00:06.607 --> 00:10.278
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.311 --> 00:13.314
- 'MORNING.
- GOOD MORNING, JOE. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING...

00:13.347 --> 00:16.217
EGGS, BACON, FRENCH TOAST?

00:16.250 --> 00:18.686
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

00:18.719 --> 00:21.155
CAN'T SOMEONE DO SOMETHING
NICE FOR A FRIEND?

00:21.189 --> 00:24.425
SURE. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

00:24.458 --> 00:27.361
WOW, YOU REALLY THINK EVERY GIFT
COMES WITH STRINGS ATTACHED, HUH?

00:27.395 --> 00:30.231
YOU LIVE IN A SAD WORLD, LONGO...
A SAD SAD WORLD.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.632
- ( laughs )
- AH!

00:31.665 --> 00:35.069
- OW.
- NO BACON TILL YOU TEACH ME JAPANESE.

00:35.103 --> 00:37.605
JAPANESE? HOW DID I
NOT SEE THAT COMING?

00:37.638 --> 00:39.607
I'VE BEEN WOOING KIMURA
INDUSTRIES FOR MONTHS NOW

00:39.640 --> 00:41.342
TO OPEN A NEW OFFICE IN TOLEDO.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.043
AND THE C.E.O. IS FINALLY
COMING TO MEET ME.

00:43.077 --> 00:45.346
IF THIS WORKS OUT, IT COULD LEAD
TO LOTS OF GOOD-PAYING JOBS

00:45.379 --> 00:49.049
AND MAYBE I CAN GET ONE OF THOSE
KNIVES THAT CUTS THROUGH A SODA CAN.

00:49.083 --> 00:52.386
LOTS OF NEW JOBS
WOULD BE AWESOME.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.155
YOU KNOW, YOU'D
LOOK LIKE A HERO.

00:54.188 --> 00:58.526
REALLY? OH, I HADN'T
THOUGHT OF THAT.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.793
YOU KNOW I'D DO
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

00:59.827 --> 01:02.230
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- BUT I CAN'T HELP YOU.

01:02.263 --> 01:05.533
HEY, HANDS OFF!
THAT'S PAYMENT BACON.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.701
YES, I LEARNED
JAPANESE FOR BUSINESS,

01:07.735 --> 01:09.803
BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING I
CAN TEACH YOU OVERNIGHT.

01:09.837 --> 01:13.073
YOU DON'T HAVE TO. MANZO KIMURA,
THE C.E.O., HE SPEAKS ENGLISH.

01:13.107 --> 01:16.644
SO I JUST NEED TO HAVE A FEW PHRASES
TO SHOW HIM I MADE AN EFFORT.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.746
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.514
BUT IN ORDER TO TEACH
YOU THE RIGHT PHRASES,

01:20.548 --> 01:22.416
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THIS
KIMURA GUY IS LIKE.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.619
HERE... THAT'S HIM.
HE'S, LIKE, 80.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.688
YOU GOTTA BE CAREFUL WITH THESE
OLD BUSINESS EXECUTIVES, MEL.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.757
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T ALWAYS
RESPECT CAREER WOMEN.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.293
WELL, HE'LL RESPECT ME.
JUST TEACH ME TO SAY,

01:32.326 --> 01:36.730
"I MAY BE A GIRL, BUT I CAN DRINK
YOU UNDER THE TABLE, SUCKA."

01:36.764 --> 01:39.633
I THINK YOUR DEMEANOR
ALREADY SAYS THAT.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.637
LET'S START WITH THE
BASICS, SHALL WE?

01:43.671 --> 01:46.374
UM, HELLO... "KONICHIWA."

01:46.407 --> 01:47.441
KONICHIWA.

01:47.475 --> 01:50.244
NICE. GOODBYE... "SAYONARA."

01:50.278 --> 01:51.745
SAYONARA.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.282
HELLO, GOODBYE... I CAN ALREADY
SING A WHOLE BEATLES SONG.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.749
I'M GREAT AT THIS.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.751
ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME ANOTHER
ONE AND MAKE IT HARD.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.721
OKAY, PLEASED TO MEET YOU...

02:00.754 --> 02:02.756
"HAJIMEMASHITE"

02:02.790 --> 02:04.292
HAJIMEMASHITE.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.594
OOH, I COULD SAY IT
SERIOUS: HAJIMEMASHITE.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.763
OR I COULD SAY IT
HAPPY: HAJIMEMASHITE!

02:09.797 --> 02:12.500
OR I COULD SAY IT
LIKE YOGI BEAR:

02:12.533 --> 02:15.336
HEY, HAJIMEMASHITE, BOO BOO!

02:16.537 --> 02:19.240
OKAY, UH, ONE MORE.
AND GIVE ME SOMETHING

02:19.273 --> 02:20.674
THAT'S GONNA IMPRESS KIMURA.

02:20.708 --> 02:25.379
OKAY, HERE IS, "DID YOU
HAVE A PLEASANT FLIGHT?"

02:25.413 --> 02:28.649
"KIMOCHI GA II SORA
NO TABI DESHITA KA?"

02:28.682 --> 02:32.353
"KIMOCHI GA II DESHITA
KA?" HOW WAS THAT?

02:32.386 --> 02:36.490
YOU JUST ASKED KIMURA IF HE
WAS PLEASURED ON HIS FLIGHT.

02:36.524 --> 02:39.227
I HAVEN'T FLOWN FIRST
CLASS IN A WHILE,

02:39.260 --> 02:41.629
BUT THAT WOULD BE ONE
HELL OF AN UPGRADE.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.600
- ♪ IT'S ALL GOOD
- ♪ ALL GOOD

02:46.634 --> 02:48.469
- ♪ IT'S OKAY
- ♪ OKAY

02:48.502 --> 02:49.870
- ♪ IT'S ALL RIGHT
- ♪ ALL RIGHT

02:49.903 --> 02:51.872
♪ AS FAR AS I CAN SEE

02:51.905 --> 02:54.141
- ♪ IT'S ALL GOOD
- ♪ ALL GOOD

02:54.174 --> 02:55.676
- ♪ IT'S OKAY

02:55.709 --> 02:57.478
- ♪ IT'S ALL RIGHT
- ♪ ALL RIGHT

02:57.511 --> 03:00.714
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK ♪

03:00.748 --> 03:02.716

03:06.887 --> 03:09.223
TOIRE WA DOKO DESU KA?

03:09.257 --> 03:11.425
NICE. YEAH, THAT WAS GOOD.
JUST ONE SMALL THING...

03:11.459 --> 03:13.661
WHEN MEETING A JAPANESE C.E.O.,
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SAY,

03:13.694 --> 03:16.764
"PLEASED TO MEET YOU," NOT
"WHERE IS THE BATHROOM?"

03:16.797 --> 03:18.599
DARN. I KEEP MIXING
THOSE TWO UP.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.601
WHY'D YOU TEACH ME "WHERE'S
THE BATHROOM" ANYWAY?

03:20.634 --> 03:22.836
THIS IS MY CITY. BATHROOMS
ARE.LL THE GOOD

03:22.870 --> 03:25.273
IT'LL COME IN HANDY WITH KIMURA
AND HIS OLD-MAN BLADDER.

03:25.306 --> 03:28.742
OKAY, ALL EYES ON ME
BECAUSE THIS IS IMPORTANT.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.244
OF COURSE IT IS.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.413
AND I'M SURE THAT
EVER HAPPENEDNG

03:32.446 --> 03:34.615
AND THE FIRST TIME IT'S
EVER HAPPENED TO ANYBODY.

03:34.648 --> 03:38.386
SO GET THIS: TO DO A
CIVIL-WAR PROJECT

03:38.419 --> 03:41.522
AND MR. BEIGLE ASSIGNED ME TO
WORK WITH KELSEY MONCREIF.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.758
NO, NOT KELSEY MONCREIF!

03:46.327 --> 03:47.728
WHO IS KELSEY MONCREIF?

03:47.761 --> 03:51.465
I HAVE NO IDEA.
KELSEY MONCREIF.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.233
IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE SWEARING.

03:53.267 --> 03:56.870
THAT GUY JUST CUT ME OFF.
"HEY, PAL, KELSEY MONCREIF!"

03:56.904 --> 03:58.939
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT REALLY DOES.

03:58.972 --> 04:02.776
ANYWAY, THERE'S THIS NEW
BOY IN SCHOOL, BRAYDEN.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.313
BRAYDEN? DOESN'T ANYONE NAME
THEIR KID STEVE ANYMORE?

04:05.346 --> 04:08.248
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL
LIKE BRISTOL AND SYRAH.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.684
I MEAN, THAT'S PROBABLY
THE NIGHT THEY... RINKING

04:10.718 --> 04:12.720
GO ON.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.389
SO KELSEY AND I
WERE BEST FRIENDS.

04:15.423 --> 04:18.359
THEN EVERYBODY TOLD ME
HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT ME

04:18.392 --> 04:19.760
AND WE NEVER TALKED AGAIN.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.762
HONEY, CAN YOU GET
THE BRAYDEN PART?

04:21.795 --> 04:24.498
BECAUSE I'M JUST NOT THAT
RIVETED BY THE BUILDUP.

04:24.532 --> 04:27.335
SO FOR 11 STRAIGHT DAYS,

04:27.368 --> 04:29.370
I SAID HI TO BRAYDEN AT LUNCH.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.505
AND THE DAY I WAS GOING TO
MAKE MY MOVE AND SIT WITH HIM

04:31.539 --> 04:33.674
GUESS WHO SWOOPS IN AND
OFFERS HIM HALF HER SANDWICH?

04:33.707 --> 04:36.810
All: KELSEY MONCREIF!

04:36.844 --> 04:40.781
YOU KNOW, HONEY, JUST BECAUSE KELSEY TALKS
TO BRAYDEN DOESN'T MEAN HE LIKES HER.

04:40.814 --> 04:43.751
OH YEAH? THEY MAKE OUT EVERY
DAY ON THE BASEBALL FIELD.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.954
OH, THEY DO. THEY EVEN
STAND ON THE CORRECT BASE.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.260
YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME
WATCHING THEM KISS, DO YOU?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.596
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT'S OKAY NOT TO.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.265
I JUST WANT TO PUT
THAT OUT THERE.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.733
YOU KNOW, HONEY, THIS SUCKS.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.503
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN FIND A WAY TO CHANNEL
YOUR ANGER INTO CREATIVITY, YOU KNOW?

05:02.536 --> 05:04.872
- WHAT'S THE ASSIGNMENT?
- KELSEY'S COMING OVER HERE LATER

05:04.905 --> 05:07.741
TO MAKE A DIORAMA OF THE
BATTLE OF BUFFINGTON ISLAND.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.843
IT'S THE ONLY MAJOR BATTLE
EVER FOUGHT IN OHIO.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.646
YOU MEAN UNTIL YOU AND KELSEY?

05:12.680 --> 05:15.649
HONEY, LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'RE IN A TOUGH SPOT,

05:15.683 --> 05:17.418
BUT WHEN KELSEY GETS HERE,

05:17.451 --> 05:19.420
I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING TO
HANDLE THIS IN A MATURE WAY.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.789
DIORAMA.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.857
I WISH SHE'D DIE-ORAMA.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.794
MATURE... VERY MATURE.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.769
STEPH, I'M GETTING WORRIED.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.805
MR. KIMURA IS LATE
AND ALMOST 80.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.807
IF HE'S NOT HERE
IN FIVE MINUTES,

05:39.840 --> 05:42.309
I'M GOOGLING HIM
TO SEE IF HE DIED.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.912
- MEL BURKE?
- YES, AND YOU ARE?

05:47.615 --> 05:50.718
"TOSHI KIMURA." YOU MUST BE MR.
KIMURA'S SON.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.886
- HAJIMEMASHITE.
- HAJIMEMASHITE.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.022
I MUST ADMIT, I
PRACTICED THAT ALL DAY.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.458
- COULD YOU TELL?
- YES, THANK YOU.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.527
WELL, WHERE'S YOUR FATHER?

05:59.560 --> 06:01.762
YES, THANK YOU.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.798
OKAY, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
A WORD I'M SAYING, DO YOU?

06:04.832 --> 06:06.634
YES, THANK YOU.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.670
OKAY. I'M JUST GONNA
MAKE A PHONE CALL.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.772
YOU KNOW, "BEEP BEEP BEEP." I
DON'T KNOW WHY I'M MIMING.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.674
I'M JUST GONNA DO IT.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.777
( dialing )

06:16.810 --> 06:19.647
- ( ringing )
- YEAH?

06:19.680 --> 06:23.350
JOE, MR. KIMURA CAN'T MAKE
IT AND HE SENT HIS SON,

06:23.383 --> 06:24.652
A DELIGHTFUL GENTLEMAN

06:24.685 --> 06:26.587
WHO SPEAKS EXACTLY THREE
WORDS OF ENGLISH.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.590
CAN YOU PLEASE GET YOUR
TRANSLATING BUTT DOWN HERE NOW?

06:29.623 --> 06:32.926
I DON'T KNOW, BURKE. ESPN'S RUNNING
THIS BEACH-VOLLEYBALL MARATHON.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.995
LONGO, I'M DYING HERE.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.465
ALL RIGHT, FINE, BUT IT'S
GONNA COST YOU A LOT MORE

06:37.498 --> 06:39.099
- THAN BREAKFAST BACON.
- HOW MUCH MORE?

06:39.132 --> 06:41.034
YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING MY
LAUNDRY FOR THE NEXT MONTH.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.770
- WHAT?
- Yeah, haven't you heard?

06:42.803 --> 06:44.772
JOE LONGO LIVES IN
A SAD SAD WORLD

06:44.805 --> 06:46.940
WHERE EVERY GIFT COMES
WITH STRINGS ATTACHED.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.076
SAYONARA, BABY.

06:50.711 --> 06:54.848
I WANTED TO HELP ALL OF
THE PEOPLE OF TOLEDO.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.819
SO I RAN

06:58.852 --> 07:00.020
FOR OFFICE

07:00.053 --> 07:02.490
AND WAS ELECTED

07:02.523 --> 07:04.391
A CITY COUNCILPERSON...

07:04.424 --> 07:07.828
THE YOUNGEST EVER.

07:07.861 --> 07:12.032
UH, CAN I BUY YOU MORE
GLUG-GLUG-GLUG-GLUG?

07:12.065 --> 07:13.133
YES, THANK YOU.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.669
EVERYBODY SPEAKS BOOZE.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.005
JOE! JOE, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.807
I'VE BEEN NODDING
LIKE A BOBBLEHEAD.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.843
THIS IS MY TRANSLATOR.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.012
HE'S NOT DEAF, BURKE.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.680
( speaking Japanese )

07:28.882 --> 07:31.652
YEAH, WE'VE BEEN COMMUNICATING
ENTIRELY THROUGH CHARADES.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.688
TOSHI'S DAD COULDN'T MAKE IT
BECAUSE HE ATE SOME BAD SHARK

07:34.722 --> 07:36.890
OR ELSE HE WAS EATEN BY A SHARK?

07:36.924 --> 07:38.992
I DON'T KNOW. I'M BETTER
AT GIVING CLUES, OKAY?

07:39.026 --> 07:40.828
RELAX. LONGO'S GOT YOU COVERED.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.997
( speaking Japanese )

08:02.816 --> 08:04.217
( both laughing )

08:04.251 --> 08:05.853
AH, DON'T MIND ME.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.589
MY STUPID LITTLE
BUSINESS DEAL CAN WAIT.

08:08.622 --> 08:10.658
IT'S POLITE TO SOCIALIZE
BEFORE YOU MAKE A DEAL.

08:10.691 --> 08:13.827
THESE JAPANESE CUSTOMS
ARE SO FRUSTRATING.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.128
I'M TALKING ABOUT IN AMERICA.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.830
WHEN YOU'RE DONE
WITH THE SMALL TALK,

08:16.864 --> 08:18.999
COULD YOU SNEAK IN A WORD
ABOUT HOW GREAT IT WOULD BE

08:19.032 --> 08:20.868
TO OPEN A NEW OFFICE
IN DOWNTOWN TOLEDO?

08:20.901 --> 08:23.604
( speaks Japanese )

08:25.205 --> 08:28.508
HE SAYS PLEASE FORGIVE HIM
FOR CONVERSING IN A LANGUAGE

08:28.542 --> 08:29.777
THAT YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND.

08:29.810 --> 08:32.746
WELL, TELL TOSHI I SAID I'M
SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE

08:32.780 --> 08:34.882
FOR MAKING HIM WAIT
FOR A TRANSLATOR.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.054
( speaks Japanese )

08:42.956 --> 08:45.058
WHAT'D HE SAY?

08:45.092 --> 08:46.860
HE SAYS SITTING WITH YOU

08:46.894 --> 08:48.862
COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE
CONSIDERED AN INCONVENIENCE.

08:48.896 --> 08:51.198
OH. KIND OF A CHARMER, HUH?

08:51.231 --> 08:54.768
TELL HIM I SAID... ( laughs )

08:56.770 --> 08:59.072
HE'S NOT BLIND, BURKE.

08:59.106 --> 09:02.610
I LIKE YOUR SMILE.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.880
AREN'T YOU GONNA TRANSLATE THAT?

09:06.914 --> 09:09.850
ARE YOU TRYING TO CLOSE A
DEAL OR CLOSE THE DEAL?

09:09.883 --> 09:12.753
YOU KNOW WHAT, LONGO? IF YOU DON'T
LIKE IT, YOU CAN JUST LEAVE.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.755
OKAY, GREAT, I'LL SEE YOU
BACK AT THE HOUSE THEN.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.924
NO NO NO! NO SAYONARA.
EVERYBODY SIT-TEE.

09:16.957 --> 09:20.027
TALK TALK, GLUG GLUG.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.731
THAT WAS REALLY SMOOTH. YOU MAY
NOT REALLY NEED ME AT ALL.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.144
SO YOU AND KELSEY ARE DOING
THE HISTORY PROJECT, HUH?

09:37.177 --> 09:39.079
I'M GLAD YOU SMOOTHED
THINGS OVER.

09:39.112 --> 09:41.281
WELL, WE'RE NOT MAKING
FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS,

09:41.314 --> 09:43.684
BUT I'VE DECIDED TO
BE THE BIGGER PERSON.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.654
( doorbell rings )

09:46.687 --> 09:48.588
THAT'S HER. AREN'T
YOU GONNA GET IT?

09:48.622 --> 09:50.791
NO! LET THE DEVIL IN MY HOUSE?

09:50.824 --> 09:52.793
ARE YOU CRAZY?

09:52.826 --> 09:55.663
YOU GET THE DOOR.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.830
WHY SHOULD I HELP YOU?

09:56.864 --> 10:01.669
BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY
SISTER YOU HAVE.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.671
DAMN, THAT'S VERY EFFECTIVE.

10:03.704 --> 10:07.074
HEY, RYDER. COME ON, LENNOX,
LET'S GET THIS THING OVER WITH.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.910
LOOK AT YOU TWO...
GETTING ALONG.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.312
SISTERHOOD IS POWERFUL. SEE YA.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.117
I AM NOT WORKING WITH HER.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.852
IT'S 25% OF YOUR GRADE.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.622
FINE.

10:22.656 --> 10:25.826
TELL HER THAT THE DARK GROUND-UP
FOAM IS FOR THE RIVERBANK

10:25.859 --> 10:27.695
AND THE GREEN GROUND-UP
FOAM IS FOR THE TREES.

10:27.728 --> 10:30.063
NO, I REFUSE TO BE PART
OF YOUR IMMATURE GAME.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.401
MAN, YOU GOT THAT DOWN.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.071
THE DARK STUFF IS FOR THE RIVER

10:38.105 --> 10:40.040
AND THE GREEN STUFF
IS FOR THE TREES.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.109
OKAY, IF THAT'S HOW
IT'S GONNA BE,

10:42.142 --> 10:44.277
TELL YOUR SISTER I BROUGHT
ALL THE SOLDIERS.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.681
OH, WHAT A SURPRISE SHE'D HAVE
HER HANDS ON ALL THE MEN.

10:47.715 --> 10:50.283
- SHE SAID...
- I HEARD HER!

10:50.317 --> 10:52.753
( high-pitched ) SHE HEARD YOU.

10:54.354 --> 10:57.157
( speaks Japanese )

10:57.190 --> 10:59.893
THIS COULD BE AN EXCELLENT
OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR COMPANY.

10:59.927 --> 11:01.962
OH, AND FOR TOLEDO AS WELL.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.831
( translates )

11:16.109 --> 11:17.677
WHAT'D HE SAY?

11:17.711 --> 11:19.947
UM, HE SAID THAT

11:19.980 --> 11:23.917
HE ADMIRES YOUR CHOICE
OF CHAMPAGNE TONIGHT.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.086
ONLY THE BEST FOR MY
FRIEND FROM JAPAN.

11:51.344 --> 11:54.314
HE SAYS HE NEEDS TO GO TO BED.

11:54.347 --> 11:57.084
ALL THAT WAS HE
NEEDS TO GO TO BED?

11:57.117 --> 11:59.719
WELL, HE USED THE POLITE FORM.
YOU KNOW, IT'S...

11:59.753 --> 12:02.055
WHAT A SHAME. BUT, YOU KNOW, I
SHOULD PROBABLY GET HOME TOO.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.323
I'M STUFFED.

12:03.356 --> 12:06.126
YOU KNOW, ALWAYS TIRED
AFTER A BIG MEAL.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.011
- WHAT'S GERI?
- STUFFED. FULL.

12:24.044 --> 12:27.514
YES, GERI. MUCHO MUCHO GERI.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.390
HE SAYS GOOD NIGHT

12:37.424 --> 12:40.928
AND THE ONION-RING LOAF
WAS AN EXOTIC TREAT.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.117
STILL NO WORD FROM
TOSHI OR HIS OFFICE?

13:04.151 --> 13:05.485
NO, NOTHING.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.955
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THINGS
WENT SO WELL LAST NIGHT,

13:07.988 --> 13:10.290
AND NOT JUST ABOUT THE
NEW OFFICE IN TOLEDO.

13:10.323 --> 13:14.361
I KIND OF GOT THE FEELING THAT TOSHI
WAS, YOU KNOW, SORT OF ATTRACTED TO ME.

13:14.394 --> 13:16.864
BUT YOU DON'T SPEAK JAPANESE.
HOW COULD YOU TELL?

13:16.897 --> 13:20.233
YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST A
FEELING, LIKE BODY LANGUAGE.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.169
OH, YEAH, LIKE MARK
FROM PERSONNEL

13:22.202 --> 13:25.172
WHO ALWAYS RUBS UP AGAINST
ME IN THE ELEVATOR.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.540
- ( doorbell rings )
- THAT'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF FEEL.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.843
YOU SHOULD REPORT THAT.

13:29.877 --> 13:32.946
AND TAKE THE STAIRS NEXT TIME.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.514
DELIVERY FOR MEL BURKE.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.549
OH, IT'S FROM TOSHI.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.887
LONG-STEMMED ROSES
IN A CRYSTAL VASE?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.889
THAT MEANS THE SAME THING
IN EVERY LANGUAGE...

13:41.922 --> 13:43.991
THIS TOSHI'S GOT BANK.

13:44.024 --> 13:47.260
"PLEASE FORGIVE BAD
GOOGLE TRANSLATION.

13:47.294 --> 13:49.462
IT WAS PLEASURABLE DOING
THE BUSINESS WITH YOU."

13:49.496 --> 13:51.999
YOU DID THE BUSINESS WITH HIM?

13:52.032 --> 13:54.467
"HOPE YOU'RE ENJOYING
MORE HEALTHY TODAY.

13:54.501 --> 13:58.471
YOUR EYES ARE BEAUTIFUL EVEN WHEN
YOU ARE SICK WITH DIARRHEA."

13:58.505 --> 14:01.241
YOU TOLD HIM YOU HAD DIARRHEA?

14:01.274 --> 14:04.878
BLONDES CAN SAY ANYTHING
AND GUYS STILL WANT YOU.

14:04.912 --> 14:06.546
I DIDN'T TELL HIM THAT.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.082
JOE MUST HAVE TOLD
HIM I HAD DIARRHEA!

14:09.116 --> 14:11.118
WHY WOULD YOU TELL JOE THAT?

14:11.151 --> 14:12.352
I DIDN'T TELL HIM THAT.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.154
JOE MUST HAVE COME UP
WITH THAT ALL ON HIS OWN.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.556
WHY? WHY WOULD JOE SAY
YOU HAD DIARRHEA?

14:16.589 --> 14:18.325
THAT'S SOMETHING
WE'LL NEVER KNOW,

14:18.358 --> 14:20.293
BECAUSE BEFORE HE HAS
A CHANCE TO TELL ME,

14:20.327 --> 14:22.862
I'M GONNA KILL HIM.

14:34.174 --> 14:38.178
HEY, I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU
AGAIN FOR TRANSLATING LAST NIGHT.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.179
I'M GLAD I COULD HELP.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.181
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY...
AT THE END OF THE NIGHT,

14:41.214 --> 14:43.183
I FELT LIKE THERE WAS A LITTLE
SPARK BETWEEN TOSHI AND ME...

14:43.216 --> 14:45.185
YOU KNOW, AN
UNSPOKEN CONNECTION?

14:45.218 --> 14:48.488
BUT THEN IT JUST KIND OF
FIZZLED OUT MYSTERIOUSLY.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.991
REALLY? I MEAN, I KNOW YOU
MADE A COUPLE OF JOKES,

14:51.024 --> 14:52.993
BUT I DIDN'T SEE ANY
REAL CONNECTION THERE.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.062
I FELT SOMETHING, I'M SURE.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.497
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, WITH
MATTERS OF THE HEART, BURKE,

14:57.530 --> 15:00.100
YOU CAN NEVER REALLY BE SURE.

15:00.133 --> 15:04.104
TRUE TRUE. UNLESS YOU GET
FLOWERS AND A CARD THAT SAYS,

15:04.137 --> 15:07.374
"I REALLY LIKE YOU. HOPE YOUR
DIARRHEA IS ALL BETTER."

15:11.378 --> 15:15.315
WOW, TOSHI'S ENGLISH
IS REALLY IMPROVING.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.151
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? I MEAN,
IT'S GOT TO BE ONE OF TWO THINGS...

15:18.185 --> 15:22.055
EITHER IT WAS TEMPORARY
INSANITY OR PERMANENT INSANITY.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.356
- BURKE, LET ME EXPLAIN...
- NO NO NO.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.092
AND IF IT WAS INSANITY,
I COULD FORGIVE YOU,

15:25.125 --> 15:26.493
BUT I'M JUST NOT
BUYING THAT DEFENSE.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.261
SO IT'S GOT TO BE, WHAT?
JEALOUSY?

15:28.295 --> 15:30.897
JEALOUSY? NOW WHO'S TALKING CRAZY?
I WAS DOING YOU A FAVOR.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.299
WHAT FAVOR?

15:32.332 --> 15:34.134
WHAT FAVOR? I'LL
TELL YOU WHAT FAVOR.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.303
ALL RIGHT, THE FAVOR WAS...

15:36.336 --> 15:38.305
LOOK, TOSHI IS A VERY
IMPORTANT BUSINESSMAN, OKAY?

15:38.338 --> 15:40.273
- BUT HE IS NOT THE RIGHT GUY FOR YOU.
- BASED ON WHAT?

15:40.307 --> 15:42.109
BASED ON WHAT? BASED
ON A FEELING.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.643
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT WAS MORE THAN
A FEELING; I HAD AN INTUITION.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.645
- YOU HAD AN INTUITION?
- YEAH, I HAD AN INTUITION.

15:45.678 --> 15:48.448
WELL, JOE, I CAN'T SEE UP YOUR SKIRT
FROM HERE, SO I'VE GOT TO ASK,

15:48.481 --> 15:50.283
ARE YOU A WOMAN?

15:50.317 --> 15:52.652
I SEE. WHAT, MEN CAN'T
HAVE INTUITIONS?

15:52.685 --> 15:54.687
OH, NO NO NO. MEN HAVE
INTUITIONS ALL THE TIME.

15:54.721 --> 15:57.290
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS WHEN MEN
HAVE THEM, THEY ARE ALWAYS WRONG.

15:57.324 --> 16:00.127
LOOK, WHAT YOU DID
DIDN'T ONLY AFFECT ME,

16:00.160 --> 16:02.162
IT COULD HAVE KILLED THE
WHOLE DEAL FOR TOLEDO.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.231
LOOK, IF TOSHI TRULY
IS NOT A SCOUNDREL,

16:04.264 --> 16:06.233
HE WILL NOT KILL THE DEAL
OVER SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.235
WELL, LUCKILY, TOSHI
DIDN'T KILL THE DEAL.

16:08.268 --> 16:10.937
HIS ASSISTANT CALLED FROM JAPAN
AND SET UP ANOTHER MEETING.

16:10.970 --> 16:14.374
TOSHI SAID HE WANTS TO CONTINUE OUR
CONVERSATION AT HIS HOTEL TONIGHT.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.676
THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S FANTASTIC.
AND I PROMISE YOU,

16:16.709 --> 16:20.013
TONIGHT I WILL TRANSLATE EVERY SINGLE
WORD YOU SAY PERFECTLY, ALL RIGHT?

16:20.047 --> 16:22.249
GREAT. YOU CAN MEET US
AT A QUARTER PAST...

16:22.282 --> 16:25.418
YOU MUST BE CRAZY IF YOU
THINK I'D HIRE YOU AGAIN!

16:32.292 --> 16:34.027
I NEED ANOTHER GUY.

16:34.061 --> 16:36.663
JUST TAKE ONE LIKE
YOU ALWAYS DO.

16:38.398 --> 16:41.168
ALMOST DONE, ALMOST
DONE, ALMOST DONE.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.970
THANK GOD, THANK GOD, THANK GOD.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.472
( cell phone rings )

16:45.505 --> 16:47.307
IT'S BRAYDEN. EXCUSE ME.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.377
YEAH, SINCE WHEN DO YOU
NEED MY PERMISSION?

16:50.410 --> 16:53.546
- OH MY GOD.
- WHAT HAPPENED?

16:53.580 --> 16:57.117
HE SAYS, "GETTING
MY LICENSE FRIDAY

16:57.150 --> 16:59.119
AND, BABE, I NEED MY FREEDOM.

16:59.152 --> 17:02.489
WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE SECOND BASE."

17:02.522 --> 17:04.357
DID BRAYDEN JUST
BREAK UP WITH YOU?

17:04.391 --> 17:05.658
YEAH.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.261
YOU WIN. HE'S ALL YOURS.

17:08.295 --> 17:11.364
I'D NEVER GO OUT WITH HIM NOW.

17:11.398 --> 17:14.601
HE BROKE UP WITH YOU
IN A TEXT MESSAGE.

17:14.634 --> 17:18.371
NOBODY DOES THAT TO
MY EX-BEST FRIEND.

17:18.405 --> 17:19.506
YOU MEAN THAT?

17:19.539 --> 17:21.208
YEAH. AFTER ALL
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH?

17:21.241 --> 17:25.011
I MEAN, YOU WERE THERE FOR ME WHEN I
HAD MY BIG CRISIS IN SECOND GRADE.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.380
WELL, CURSIVE IS TOUGH.

17:27.414 --> 17:30.250
YOU KNOW, WHEN I
TRANSFERRED HERE,

17:30.283 --> 17:33.253
I HEARD YOU WERE STILL A BITCH,
BUT YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.622
YEAH, AND I HEARD YOU
WERE A TWO-FACED SLUT.

17:35.655 --> 17:38.458
I THINK THE ONLY REASON
WE STOPPED GETTING ALONG

17:38.491 --> 17:41.228
WAS BECAUSE OF A BUNCH
OF STUPID RUMORS.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.163
I AM SO DONE WITH ALL
THAT PETTY GOSSIP.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.431
ME TOO.

17:46.266 --> 17:49.502
- WHO SAID I WAS A BITCH?
- WHO SAID I WAS A SLUT?

18:00.647 --> 18:01.781
KONICHIWA.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.183
KONICHIWA.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.584
THANK YOU.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.386
OH, I'VE GOT A NEW ONE. UM...

18:06.419 --> 18:08.388
TOIRE WA DOKO DESU KA?

18:08.421 --> 18:10.056
( speaks Japanese )

18:10.089 --> 18:12.392
OH, NO NO NO, I DON'T ACTUALLY
HAVE TO USE THE BATHROOM.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.228
I WAS JUST SHOWING OFF.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.797
SO, I'M... TUMMY IS ALL GOOD.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.133
THUMBS UP. NO PROBLEMS
DOWN THERE AT ALL.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.401
WHEW.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.303
YEAH. "THANK GOODNESS" IS RIGHT.

18:26.273 --> 18:29.776
YOU KNOW, TOSHI, EVEN THOUGH WE
DON'T SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE,

18:29.809 --> 18:31.411
I REALLY LIKE YOU.

18:31.444 --> 18:35.215
( speaks Japanese )

18:35.248 --> 18:39.852
I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU JUST SAID, BUT
YOU SURE LOOK PRETTY SAYING IT.

18:39.886 --> 18:43.156
SEE, LIKE THAT. USUALLY
WHEN I MEET A CUTE GUY,

18:43.190 --> 18:45.392
I SPEND SO MUCH ENERGY TRYING
TO HIDE WHAT I'M THINKING,

18:45.425 --> 18:47.627
BUT WITH YOU I CAN JUST SAY IT.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.829
- SAKE?
- OH, WE'LL GET TO THAT.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.564
FIRST, BUSINESS BEFORE PLEASURE.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.800
UM, YOUR ASSISTANT SAID
THERE'D BE A TRANSLATOR.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.603
WHAT TIME IS THE
TRANSLATOR COMING?

18:56.636 --> 18:59.306
HI, I'M PASSION.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.174
YOU'RE THE TRANSLATOR?

19:01.208 --> 19:04.711
SURE. I'M WHATEVER
YOU WANT ME TO BE.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.480
OKAY, I THINK THERE'S
BEEN A MISUNDERSTANDING.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.683
I GOT A CALL; I CAME OVER.
I UNDERSTAND IT.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.720
NO NO NO, YOU SEE, TOSHI
DOESN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.455
YES, THANK YOU.

19:15.488 --> 19:18.391
SEE, HE DOESN'T KNOW ENGLISH.
HE ONLY KNOWS THREE WORDS.

19:18.425 --> 19:19.692
YES, THREESOME.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.764
WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW? TOSHI
LEARNED A FOURTH WORD.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.766
OKAY WELL, TOSHI,

19:26.799 --> 19:29.369
YOU CAN TRANSLATE THIS...

19:29.402 --> 19:31.838
KELSEY MONCREIF!

19:34.474 --> 19:37.143
KELSEY MONCREIF?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.779
SURE, BUT IT'LL COST YOU EXTRA.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.351
( sighs )

19:44.384 --> 19:46.553
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU
HOME THIS EARLY.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.155
YEAH, WELL, TOSHI'S A BUSY GUY.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.758
TURNS OUT I WASN'T THE ONLY THING
ON HIS TO-DO LIST TONIGHT.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.394
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:54.427 --> 19:56.429
IT'S JUST THAT... ( shudders )

19:56.463 --> 19:58.298
- I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.
- ALL RIGHT, I GET IT.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.500
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.370
TOSHI'S GROSS, YOU KNOW? HE'S
A SLIMEBALL, A SLEAZEBAG.

20:03.403 --> 20:05.372
DON'T WE HAVE ENOUGH
PERVS HERE IN TOLEDO?

20:05.405 --> 20:07.407
NOW WE HAVE TO START
IMPORTING THEM?

20:07.440 --> 20:10.477
SO, YES, LONGO, YOUR INTUITION
WAS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

20:10.510 --> 20:13.680
IT WAS? I MEAN, YEAH... YEAH.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.682
THAT'S RIGHT, IT WAS.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.451
LUCKY FOR YOU I HAD
SUCH GOOD INTUITION.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.653
WELL, I'M GONNA HEAD UPSTAIRS

20:20.687 --> 20:22.422
AND HAVE THE HAZMAT
TEAM HOSE ME OFF.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.426
JOE, YOU REMEMBER YESTERDAY
WHEN I, YOU KNOW,

20:26.459 --> 20:29.195
ACCUSED YOU OF BEING
KIND OF JEALOUS?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.298
- YEAH?
- NOW I KNOW I WAS WRONG.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.766
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T ABOUT THAT AT
ALL; YOU WERE JUST PROTECTING ME.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.404
YEP, THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT I WAS
DOING... JUST LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.805
THANKS.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.707
HEY?

20:40.740 --> 20:43.810
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
WE ALL MISINTERPRET.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.494
- HEY.
- HEY.

21:01.528 --> 21:03.563
GOOD NEWS.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.698
TOSHI'S DAD HAD PARASITES.

21:05.732 --> 21:08.901
YAY! GO, PARASITES.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.438
NO, THAT MEANS MANZO KIMURA
WASN'T EATEN BY A SHARK.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.906
HE'S COMING HERE TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT OPENING THAT NEW OFFICE.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.842
DOES KIMURA KNOW WHAT HIS
SON TRIED TO PULL ON YOU?

21:15.875 --> 21:17.677
WELL, HE WILL ONCE I TELL HIM,

21:17.710 --> 21:21.848
TOSHI WA OOKINA
SOSEJI O MOTTE IMASU.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.717
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
JUST SAID, BURKE?

21:24.751 --> 21:28.588
YEAH... "TOSHI IS
A HUGE WEINER."

21:28.621 --> 21:30.390
"HAS."

21:30.423 --> 21:33.360
YOU JUST SAID, "HE HAS..."

21:34.594 --> 21:37.330
MAN, THIS IS ONE
TRICKY LANGUAGE.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.571
( theme music playing )
