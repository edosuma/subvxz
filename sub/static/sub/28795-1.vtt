02:28.981 --> 02:30.914
Why are you doing this, Dexter?

02:30.916 --> 02:32.882
We were partners.
The artifacts...

02:32.884 --> 02:34.951
- Should be mine.
- [Jin] <i>No!</i>

02:34.953 --> 02:37.257
It belongs to the people.

02:37.489 --> 02:39.856
Well, I'm a people.

02:39.858 --> 02:42.829
And I know how to make
a fortune from it.

02:43.027 --> 02:45.764
[Jin grunts]
<i>You'll make us both crash.</i>

03:00.946 --> 03:02.411
[Norm] Sorry, kids.
Running late.

03:02.413 --> 03:03.649
Got to see Grandpa.

03:07.352 --> 03:09.354

Oh, gosh.

03:32.411 --> 03:34.781
I got to get to Grandpa.
I'm late.

03:36.448 --> 03:38.418
He's gone. Oh, great.
He's right there.

03:39.050 --> 03:41.417
It's fine. It's fine.
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

03:41.419 --> 03:42.785
I got it. Hi, Grandpa.

03:42.787 --> 03:45.424
I got... I got...
[panting]

03:45.791 --> 03:46.922
You're late.

03:46.924 --> 03:49.024
Sorry, Grandpa.
Is everything all right?

03:49.026 --> 03:50.630
More than all right.

03:50.929 --> 03:53.130
I have a request of you, Norm.

03:53.132 --> 03:57.600
Uh, it doesn't involve
trimming your nose hairs again,

03:57.602 --> 04:00.005
- does it?
- [Grandpa chuckles] No.

04:03.408 --> 04:07.880
I want you, as king,
to preside over a wedding.

04:08.146 --> 04:09.948
Sure. Whose?

04:10.515 --> 04:11.650
Mine!

04:20.426 --> 04:21.891
You know that Judith and I

04:21.892 --> 04:24.096
have been spending
a lot of time together.

04:24.729 --> 04:27.864
And I've come to realize
that I love her

04:27.866 --> 04:29.432
and she loves me.

04:29.434 --> 04:31.001
And we want to marry.

04:31.003 --> 04:34.136
And according to tradition,
since you are king,

04:34.138 --> 04:36.908
I am asking your approval.

04:37.742 --> 04:39.910
My approval, eh?

04:39.912 --> 04:41.076
Hmm.

04:41.078 --> 04:43.014
Well, you know what I say.

04:44.482 --> 04:46.816
I say abso-bear-lutely.

04:46.818 --> 04:48.420
This is fantastic.
A wedding,

04:48.686 --> 04:50.821
followed by, uh,
a wedding party.

04:50.823 --> 04:52.458
Let's do it.
When? Tonight?

04:52.924 --> 04:56.126
According to tradition,
a former king's wedding

04:56.128 --> 04:58.727
can only occur
under the special glow

04:58.729 --> 05:01.864
- of the Aurora Borealis.
- The Northern Lights.

05:01.866 --> 05:06.035
So many colors,
red, green, uh, blue green,

05:06.037 --> 05:08.605
uh, sort of a yellowy green.

05:08.607 --> 05:10.139
Um, I guess really mostly green.

05:10.141 --> 05:12.477
Uh, Norm! Norm!

05:13.111 --> 05:14.647
Stop naming colors.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.513
The Aurora Borealis
is due to occur

05:17.515 --> 05:19.915
in exactly six days.

05:19.917 --> 05:20.884
Six days? Got it.

05:20.886 --> 05:23.989
I'm so happy for you,
and for you, Judith.

05:25.023 --> 05:27.557
Now, are you sure
you'll be there

05:27.559 --> 05:29.095
to perform the ceremony?

05:29.895 --> 05:32.127
Your word is your bond.

05:32.129 --> 05:34.965
And in things,
both large and small,

05:34.967 --> 05:38.201
giving your word
and being true to your word

05:38.203 --> 05:40.039
means everything.

05:40.239 --> 05:41.441
Yes.

05:42.441 --> 05:44.107
Your subjects must know
that when a king says

05:44.109 --> 05:47.076
he will be somewhere
or do something,

05:47.078 --> 05:48.978
he will not let them down.

05:48.980 --> 05:51.013
Well said, Socrates.

05:51.015 --> 05:52.717
Hmm. I got it.

05:53.051 --> 05:54.850
Plus, I need to set an example.

05:54.852 --> 05:57.523
My family and the bears
of my kingdom look up to me.

05:57.823 --> 06:00.590
And, hey, hey,
we got a wedding coming up.

06:00.592 --> 06:02.292
I need to let
my human pals know.

06:02.294 --> 06:03.792
Don't worry, I got this.

06:03.794 --> 06:04.860
[Norm screams]

06:04.862 --> 06:06.929
- [thudding]
- [Norm groaning]

06:06.931 --> 06:10.001
Oh. Ow. It hurts. Ow.

06:17.809 --> 06:19.645
[phone ringing]

06:21.580 --> 06:22.281
[phone beeps]

06:22.748 --> 06:25.782
Hey, Olympia, Vera.
Hi, Fong.

06:25.784 --> 06:27.016
- <i>Hi, Norm.</i>
- <i>Hello.</i>

06:27.018 --> 06:28.785
<i>Wonderful to see you.</i>

06:28.787 --> 06:29.722
<i>What's up?</i>

06:30.655 --> 06:32.788
Big stuff.
My Grandpa is getting married.

06:32.790 --> 06:33.725
[gasping]

06:34.893 --> 06:37.826
<i>A later-in-life marriage,
such a beautiful thing.</i>

06:37.828 --> 06:40.196
Oh, we'll have to get a gift
for the happy couple.

06:40.198 --> 06:42.831
<i>Uh, bears don't do
the gift thing.</i>

06:42.833 --> 06:45.670
We have everything we need,
snow, ice, fish.

06:45.970 --> 06:49.007
Uh, more snow,
more ice, more fish.

06:49.775 --> 06:51.908
Okay.
Then what about the reception?

06:51.910 --> 06:52.979
Have you made plans?

06:53.311 --> 06:56.181
Yup. We plan to have it
in six days.

06:56.582 --> 06:59.648
- [chuckles]
- Never mind. We'll help out.

06:59.650 --> 07:03.622
Any ideas about food,
decorations, entertainment?

07:03.821 --> 07:06.157
<i>Yes. Those would be good.</i>

07:06.857 --> 07:09.359
Okay, then great.
So you'll all come?

07:09.361 --> 07:11.261
- [Vera] <i>Of course, we will.</i>
- [Olympia] <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

07:11.263 --> 07:13.763
Because we're always there
for each other.

07:13.765 --> 07:16.068
And I know when you say
you'll be here,

07:17.099 --> 07:18.134
it's a promise, right?

07:18.136 --> 07:19.304
Yes. Of course.

07:19.737 --> 07:21.737
And a promise means
giving your word.

07:21.739 --> 07:23.672
- And your word is your bond.
- Norm,

07:23.674 --> 07:25.877
we said we'd be there
and we'll be there.

07:26.645 --> 07:30.080
Great. So, just to be clear,
I have your word on this?

07:30.082 --> 07:32.618
- [all] Mm-hmm.
- [Norm] <i>Say it.</i>

07:32.818 --> 07:34.554
[all] <i>You have our word.</i>

07:37.321 --> 07:40.122
[beeping]

07:40.124 --> 07:43.228
Hey! It's the new app
I put on your phone, Pop.

07:44.162 --> 07:45.931
It tracks UFOs.

07:46.131 --> 07:49.167
[phone beeping]

07:49.835 --> 07:51.667
- What's that?
- You know, Pops,

07:51.669 --> 07:54.838
Unidentified Flying Objects,
spaceships, aliens.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.976
No, I mean what's an app?

07:57.909 --> 08:01.177
It's a digitally-downloaded
application that...

08:01.179 --> 08:04.713
It's a special thing
your phone does.

08:04.715 --> 08:08.821
The app is telling me that
we've got some flying objects.

08:10.354 --> 08:12.157
[beeping quickens]

08:12.724 --> 08:13.759
[beeping stops]

08:14.825 --> 08:17.028
And now they're gone.
Weird.

08:25.136 --> 08:29.105
Some strange doings over
by Misty Mountain Glacier.

08:29.107 --> 08:31.674
Uh, why would anyone even wanna
go to Misty Mountain Glacier?

08:31.676 --> 08:35.648
It's so misty and mountain-y
and, uh, glacier-y.

08:36.380 --> 08:37.916
[wind howling]

08:38.149 --> 08:41.818
It is indeed
a strange and dangerous place.

08:41.820 --> 08:45.988
Some blizzards, avalanches,
shrouded by fog.

08:45.990 --> 08:47.690
Sounds cool, I'm in.

08:47.692 --> 08:48.693
[both] Uh-huh.

08:49.027 --> 08:50.193
[Norm] Nope.

08:50.195 --> 08:53.228
This is a job for a king,
which I am.

08:53.230 --> 08:55.464
And I gave my word
to protect this kingdom,

08:55.466 --> 08:57.232
and I will keep my word

08:57.234 --> 09:01.106
- because...
- Pop... Just go, okay?

09:01.406 --> 09:04.473
Yes, I will. Alone.

09:04.475 --> 09:06.077
As befits a king.

09:11.115 --> 09:12.781
I'm not, uh, afraid.

09:12.783 --> 09:13.885
Uh...

09:15.052 --> 09:16.118
Okay.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.221
[wind howling]

09:18.223 --> 09:19.925
[grunts]

09:21.258 --> 09:22.391
I got this.

09:22.393 --> 09:23.696
I got this.

09:24.361 --> 09:25.330
Huh?

09:30.469 --> 09:33.773
Hey, no lemmings.
This is a solo mission.

09:34.339 --> 09:36.175
[chittering]

09:43.047 --> 09:44.347
Guys, this is a dangerous place.

09:44.349 --> 09:45.482
- [wind howling]
- Hear that?

09:45.484 --> 09:46.982
Blizzard winds.

09:46.984 --> 09:49.251
- [wind howling]
- [chittering]

09:49.253 --> 09:50.453
Now, go!

09:50.455 --> 09:53.459
[chittering]

10:03.033 --> 10:06.037
[wind howling]

10:14.045 --> 10:15.080
Hmm?

10:21.920 --> 10:23.122
[laughing]

10:34.832 --> 10:37.869
[wind howling]

10:43.108 --> 10:45.044
I wonder what happened
to the pilot.

10:45.976 --> 10:49.112
[sniffing]

10:49.114 --> 10:51.117
Oh, footprints.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.133
[beeping]

11:11.135 --> 11:12.901
[gasps]
Aha.

11:12.903 --> 11:14.072
[beeping]

11:31.455 --> 11:32.856
Aha!

11:32.858 --> 11:35.027

11:39.263 --> 11:41.399
[rumbling]

11:45.970 --> 11:47.138

[groans]

12:04.388 --> 12:05.557
[Norm groans]

12:07.325 --> 12:09.261
- [beeping]
- Huh?

12:09.960 --> 12:10.995
Hmm.

12:14.566 --> 12:17.099
This is what little dude
must have been looking for.

12:17.101 --> 12:19.103
Hey! Are you okay?

12:19.571 --> 12:21.974
[Jin groaning]

12:22.440 --> 12:23.909
[Norm] <i>Oh, this can't be good.</i>

12:24.441 --> 12:27.446
[grunts]

12:32.017 --> 12:33.082
[sighs]

12:33.084 --> 12:35.020
[groans]

12:35.220 --> 12:37.386
- Hey, there!
- [gasps]

12:37.388 --> 12:40.055
A talking polar bear?

12:40.057 --> 12:43.194
You must be Norm of the North.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.995
[chuckles] Yeah.
Except I got this promotion.

12:45.997 --> 12:47.063
Not a big deal.

12:47.065 --> 12:49.635
But I'm now
King Norm of the North.

12:50.134 --> 12:53.102
And I believe
this belongs to you.

12:53.104 --> 12:54.503
Oh, thank goodness.

12:54.505 --> 12:57.506
This has to be returned
to China immediately.

12:57.508 --> 13:00.309
Well, no way we're getting out
of this cave until morning,

13:00.311 --> 13:02.011
when the sun
warms the ice a bit

13:02.013 --> 13:04.046
and makes the digging out
easier. Hmm.

13:04.048 --> 13:06.315
- [groans]
- Whoa. You okay?

13:06.317 --> 13:09.017
Just a little shaken
by the cave-in

13:09.019 --> 13:11.155
and woozy from the plane crash.

13:11.422 --> 13:12.722
What are you doing out here?

13:12.724 --> 13:15.927
This place is dangerous
and misty.

13:16.460 --> 13:19.127
I dropped this down here
because someone was trying

13:19.129 --> 13:20.566
to steal it from me.

13:22.133 --> 13:23.134
[thud]

13:26.303 --> 13:27.338
[chuckles]

13:32.576 --> 13:34.176
[thunder rumbling]

13:34.178 --> 13:35.113
[gasps]

13:37.715 --> 13:40.286
[Jin] <i>I'd flown
so far off course,</i>

13:40.484 --> 13:42.253
<i>I ran out of gas.</i>

13:42.586 --> 13:45.189
[alarm blaring]

13:45.724 --> 13:47.459
I landed it as best I could.

13:47.658 --> 13:50.693
Yeah, I saw your plane
down by the... Wait.

13:50.695 --> 13:53.628
You threw this valuable artifact
thing out the window?

13:53.630 --> 13:56.968
Yes, but it had a computer chip
so I knew I could find it again.

13:57.201 --> 14:00.571
And I did, here in this cave,
but then the cave-in occurred.

14:01.138 --> 14:04.073
I feel great shame and sorrow.

14:04.075 --> 14:05.978
[Norm] Well, who's trying
to steal it form you?

14:06.677 --> 14:08.547
A man named Dexter.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.313
He and I were partners.

14:10.315 --> 14:14.119
<i>Curators of antiquity in China
at a university museum.</i>

14:17.455 --> 14:19.021
<i>But a few years ago,</i>

14:19.023 --> 14:20.655
<i>I noticed that
some of the antiquities</i>

14:20.657 --> 14:21.659
<i>had gone missing.</i>

14:22.661 --> 14:24.496
<i>And I suspected that
they had been stolen.</i>

14:24.796 --> 14:28.164
<i>Dexter swore he knew nothing
about these thefts,</i>

14:28.166 --> 14:30.466
<i>but I had my suspicions.</i>

14:30.468 --> 14:33.336
<i>I placed computer chips
on all the antiquities.</i>

14:33.338 --> 14:34.271
<i>Should one get stolen,</i>

14:34.273 --> 14:37.040
<i>I would be able to track
its location.</i>

14:37.042 --> 14:40.543
<i>My suspicions about Dexter
soon proved to be true.</i>

14:40.545 --> 14:44.283
<i>I caught him red-handed
selling off an ancient relic.</i>

14:44.715 --> 14:48.454
<i>Fired by the university board,
Dexter left in disgrace.</i>

14:50.422 --> 14:53.124
You see,
the artifact is of great value.

14:53.391 --> 14:55.391
Beyond the kind
that money can bring.

14:55.393 --> 14:57.325
It is the key to
the hidden treasures

14:57.327 --> 14:59.127
of ancient Chinese emperors

14:59.129 --> 15:02.333
contained within
the Mountain of Nine Cauldrons.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.400
And it must be returned
to China immediately

15:05.402 --> 15:07.703
so it can used for an event
that occurs

15:07.705 --> 15:10.209
but once every hundred years.

15:12.744 --> 15:14.146
[groans]

15:14.646 --> 15:16.482
Promise me something, Norm.

15:16.681 --> 15:19.582
If I don't make it,
you will see that this gets

15:19.584 --> 15:21.317
to my grandson, Chen.

15:21.319 --> 15:22.852
Uh, what are you talking about?

15:22.854 --> 15:25.190
You said it yourself,
you'll make it just fine.

15:25.456 --> 15:28.723
But if I don't,
Chen lives in Beijing,

15:28.725 --> 15:30.726
teaches at the university.

15:30.728 --> 15:32.795
Beijing, university, got it.

15:32.797 --> 15:35.033
If you don't make it,
I'll give the artifact to him.

15:37.234 --> 15:38.637
- Promise?
- For sure.

15:39.269 --> 15:40.338
Hmm.

15:41.172 --> 15:43.305
- I have your word?
- Absolutely.

15:43.307 --> 15:44.274
You can count on me.

15:44.276 --> 15:47.609
I'm a king,
and a king's word is his bond.

15:47.611 --> 15:48.746
Hmm.

15:50.547 --> 15:52.583
Can you just say it?

15:53.317 --> 15:55.251
I give you my word.
You have my word.

15:55.253 --> 15:56.388
Consider it given.

15:57.589 --> 15:59.258
You're gonna be just fine.

15:59.556 --> 16:01.627
Now, come on,
let's get you warmed up.

16:02.594 --> 16:04.894
Here we go. All right,
let's scoot over here.

16:04.896 --> 16:06.362
- Sorry.
- [Jin groans]

16:06.364 --> 16:07.796
Pardon me.
You all right there?

16:07.798 --> 16:10.701
Norm, you're crushing me.
[grunts]

16:25.517 --> 16:27.719
- [bones crack]
- [yawns]

16:31.288 --> 16:33.324
Hey, Jin, wakey-wakey!

16:33.725 --> 16:35.627
We could try
and dig our way out now.

16:37.662 --> 16:38.864
[groans]

16:40.697 --> 16:41.863
Hmm?

16:41.865 --> 16:44.702
[jackhammer pounding]

16:46.937 --> 16:48.306
[screams]

16:50.340 --> 16:51.741
Ah!

16:51.743 --> 16:53.744
[grunts] Lemmings!

16:55.647 --> 16:57.282
[chittering]

17:01.819 --> 17:03.251
Hold it.

17:03.253 --> 17:04.854
Uh, I'm worried
about another cave-in

17:04.856 --> 17:06.290
if there's any kind of digging.

17:07.558 --> 17:08.957
Might be best to wait for the
sun to melt the ice some more,

17:08.959 --> 17:10.795
unless you have a better idea.

17:11.361 --> 17:13.131
- [all] Hmm?
- Pee-pee!

17:13.798 --> 17:15.901
- [peeing]
- [groans]

17:16.800 --> 17:18.401
Uh, just a tip.

17:18.403 --> 17:20.405
If you get thirsty,
don't eat the yellow snow.

17:21.539 --> 17:23.905
[cracking]

17:23.906 --> 17:25.810
Okay. Hold it. Stop!

17:26.511 --> 17:28.880
The melting was good,
but there's too much cracking.

17:29.347 --> 17:31.513
[cracking]

17:31.515 --> 17:33.451
[rumbling]

17:51.336 --> 17:52.437
Never mind me.

17:53.571 --> 17:54.705
Save this.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.507
[sighs]
Safe and sound.

17:58.509 --> 18:01.344
[rumbling]

18:01.346 --> 18:02.513
Look out!

18:04.381 --> 18:05.516
[gasps]

18:06.751 --> 18:07.753
[grunts]

18:10.821 --> 18:11.924
[gasps]

18:16.628 --> 18:19.630
[grunts]

18:21.632 --> 18:25.269
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I got this. I got this.

18:29.706 --> 18:31.676
[creaking]

18:35.513 --> 18:36.648
[grunts]

18:36.880 --> 18:37.780
[sighs]

18:37.782 --> 18:39.682
Wouldn't wanna have
to do that again.

18:39.684 --> 18:42.018
Uh, the artifact?

18:42.020 --> 18:44.388
Got it right... Hmm?

18:44.722 --> 18:45.924
[sighs]

18:46.924 --> 18:48.594
[creaks]

18:53.398 --> 18:54.565
[grunts]

18:55.565 --> 18:56.601
Okay.

19:04.975 --> 19:06.445
[grunts]

19:13.016 --> 19:15.419
[grunts]

19:16.987 --> 19:18.023
Thanks.

19:18.523 --> 19:19.688
Yes.

19:19.690 --> 19:21.826
[rumbling]

19:36.808 --> 19:38.644
[pants]

19:39.042 --> 19:40.311
[grunts]

19:40.645 --> 19:42.281
[screaming]

19:45.550 --> 19:46.717
[groans]

19:54.859 --> 19:56.692
[groans]

19:56.694 --> 19:58.330
[gasps]

19:58.830 --> 20:01.633
I need to catch my breath.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.666
Sure. Sure.
Hey, you'll be okay.

20:04.668 --> 20:06.836
I'll get you back to home base,
warm you up.

20:06.838 --> 20:08.370
I've got human friends coming.

20:08.372 --> 20:09.805
Anything you need,
anything you want.

20:09.807 --> 20:12.844
There's but one thing
I need or want,

20:13.043 --> 20:16.982
for you to keep you promise
and return this to Beijing.

20:17.881 --> 20:19.882
- Hmm.
- [groans]

20:19.884 --> 20:22.587
[Dexter] Well, well, well.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.355
Jin.

20:24.589 --> 20:27.956
I say, not looking so good,
old chap.

20:27.958 --> 20:31.662
Oh, I'll have that artifact
if you don't mind.

20:31.963 --> 20:33.796
[laughs]

20:33.798 --> 20:38.570
I see you've made friends
with the famous dancing bear.

20:38.869 --> 20:40.903
Norm, isn't it?

20:40.905 --> 20:43.638
That's King Norm,
thank you very much.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.640
And, no,
you may not have the artifact.

20:45.642 --> 20:46.844
[chuckles]

20:48.111 --> 20:50.546
You don't really want old Jin
to get hit with a venom dart,

20:50.548 --> 20:51.483
do you?

20:53.050 --> 20:54.519
[gasps]

20:55.119 --> 20:57.923
Probably not.
Venom's a bad thing, right?

20:58.156 --> 20:59.621
Very.

20:59.623 --> 21:02.457
These particular darts
are soaked in the venom

21:02.459 --> 21:06.965
of my trained Komodo dragons,
Mayhem and Chaos.

21:08.465 --> 21:10.598
Yeah, he's got your eyes.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.834
And my nose.

21:11.836 --> 21:12.934
[chuckles]

21:12.936 --> 21:15.805
Their venom is highly toxic.

21:15.807 --> 21:16.972
In his weakened state,

21:16.974 --> 21:19.378
Jin's chances of surviving
would be...

21:19.676 --> 21:21.109
Oh, I don't know.

21:21.111 --> 21:22.912
About zero.

21:22.914 --> 21:24.780
[laughs]

21:24.782 --> 21:28.486
Now, the artifact,
if you don't mind.

21:28.919 --> 21:31.489
- No, Norm, don't.
- [chittering]

21:32.689 --> 21:35.624
[laughs]

21:35.626 --> 21:37.929
- [sighs]
- [chittering]

21:40.031 --> 21:41.629
- [chittering]
- [gun cocks]

21:41.631 --> 21:43.699
[laughs]

21:43.701 --> 21:45.934
Are these rodents your henchmen?

21:45.936 --> 21:47.839
Your muscle?

21:48.673 --> 21:49.907
[grunts]

21:50.475 --> 21:51.840
Oh, no.

21:51.842 --> 21:54.845
[laughs]

21:56.613 --> 21:58.614
Hey, what are you...
[laughs]

21:58.616 --> 21:59.818
No.
[screams]

22:02.686 --> 22:05.689
[laughs]

22:09.092 --> 22:10.461
[chittering]

22:14.831 --> 22:16.066
[gasps]
Oh, no.

22:16.934 --> 22:19.905
[grunting]

22:25.243 --> 22:28.713
[Dexter] My precious artifact,
give it to me!

22:32.049 --> 22:33.051
Aha!

22:38.121 --> 22:39.224
[grunts]

22:42.126 --> 22:44.659
[grunting]

22:44.661 --> 22:46.597
Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine.

22:47.665 --> 22:49.501
That's mine!

22:52.969 --> 22:54.138
[chuckles]

22:58.074 --> 22:59.510
[Dexter grunts]

23:09.219 --> 23:11.523
[beeping]

23:12.188 --> 23:13.190
What?

23:16.994 --> 23:20.064
May I see the desert menu,
please, miss?

23:21.565 --> 23:23.234
- [squeaking]
- [thud]

23:24.234 --> 23:27.638
[snores]

23:29.573 --> 23:32.074
[Dexter laughs]

23:32.076 --> 23:33.876
I'll have that now.

23:33.878 --> 23:37.616
Thank you,
you ursine buffoon.

23:37.915 --> 23:39.748
[Jin] No, Dexter.

23:39.750 --> 23:43.751
Think of the Chinese people
and their treasure.

23:43.753 --> 23:45.790
Oh, I am.

23:45.990 --> 23:51.530
And how much money I'll have
after I loot it and sell it.

23:51.762 --> 23:53.598
[laughs]

23:55.065 --> 23:56.066
[groans]

24:08.111 --> 24:10.080
[chittering]

24:11.616 --> 24:13.018
[groans]

24:13.650 --> 24:15.820
- [Jin groans]
- Huh?

24:16.286 --> 24:17.288
Huh?

24:17.855 --> 24:19.691
[groans]

24:22.726 --> 24:25.129
[wolves howling]

24:46.650 --> 24:47.651
Huh?

24:50.186 --> 24:51.255
Oh.

24:55.059 --> 24:56.795
Take care of my friend, okay?

24:58.763 --> 25:01.129
Keep him warm and let him rest.

25:01.131 --> 25:02.734
You got it, King Norm.

25:04.869 --> 25:06.071
[groans]

25:13.244 --> 25:14.777
[chittering]

25:14.779 --> 25:16.781
[Norm] Hey, kids!

25:17.281 --> 25:20.148
I'm sure you were all worried,
me being gone all night

25:20.150 --> 25:21.983
after venturing
to the mysterious

25:21.985 --> 25:23.388
Misty Mountain Glacier.

25:23.987 --> 25:26.190
[all] Uh... Hmm?

25:26.791 --> 25:28.259
And then the blizzard.

25:30.828 --> 25:33.428
- Um, not really.
- [Olympia] Hi, Norm.

25:33.430 --> 25:35.299
- There you are.
- Norm.

25:35.933 --> 25:39.201
- So good to see you, my friend.
- [laughs]

25:39.203 --> 25:41.403
Where were you?
I tried calling and calling.

25:41.405 --> 25:44.743
- Uh, oops. I had it turned off.
- [phone chimes]

25:45.341 --> 25:48.412
[phone ringing]

25:49.746 --> 25:52.013
[echoing]
Uh, hi, Olympia.

25:52.015 --> 25:55.419
It was a difficult flight.
Very blizzardy.

25:55.886 --> 25:58.252
Now, then, I wanna get
some establishing shots

25:58.254 --> 25:59.757
for the video.

26:00.357 --> 26:02.394
Where's the space
that the wedding will be held?

26:02.926 --> 26:04.092
Space?

26:04.094 --> 26:06.228
Um, no,
we're doing it down here.

26:06.230 --> 26:09.498
Oh, are you doing it
"al fresco"?

26:09.500 --> 26:12.201
- I'm sorry, Al who?
- She means outside, Norm.

26:12.203 --> 26:13.202
Well, yeah.

26:13.204 --> 26:15.404
Pretty much everything
around here is outside.

26:15.406 --> 26:17.071
Except for caves.

26:17.073 --> 26:19.374
Uh, but I've seen enough
of those to last me a year.

26:19.376 --> 26:22.845
Yes, this whole area
will be prefect.

26:22.847 --> 26:25.947
The ceremony here.
The band here.

26:25.949 --> 26:29.253
All backlit
by the Aurora Borealis. Oh!

26:29.820 --> 26:31.353
[gasps]
I just remembered.

26:31.355 --> 26:32.921
While all this planning's
going on,

26:32.923 --> 26:34.388
I have to be somewhere else.

26:34.390 --> 26:36.125
I gave my word.

26:36.127 --> 26:38.126
I said I'd deliver
an old artifact

26:38.128 --> 26:41.398
for my human friend, Jin,
to his grandson in Beijing.

26:41.831 --> 26:44.799
Ooh, I love artifacts.
Let's see it.

26:44.801 --> 26:49.873
Well, it kind of got stolen away
by this bad human named Dexter.

26:50.107 --> 26:53.142
So, how will you deliver
an artifact to Beijing

26:53.144 --> 26:55.077
that you don't have?

26:55.079 --> 26:57.178
Well, that's the tricky part.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.447
First step, find Dexter.

26:59.449 --> 27:02.086
Second, get the artifact back.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.156
Third, get it to Chen,
Jin's grandson.

27:05.388 --> 27:08.389
But surely all that can wait
until after the wedding.

27:08.391 --> 27:09.357
Nope.

27:09.359 --> 27:11.993
Well, that is gonna make
the wedding planning

27:11.995 --> 27:14.296
and shooting of the video
rather difficult.

27:14.298 --> 27:16.799
Since we don't speak bear.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.869
[Quinn] But I speak human.

27:19.936 --> 27:22.136
I've got it covered, Pops.
I'll take charge.

27:22.138 --> 27:25.507
I mean, I am your oldest
and next in line to be king.

27:25.509 --> 27:28.378
I guess, sure.
Okay, Quinn, you're in charge.

27:28.913 --> 27:31.980
Way to go, Quinn.
My good pal is acting king.

27:31.982 --> 27:32.947
[scoffs]

27:32.949 --> 27:35.850
I'm afraid I won't be doing
any high fives

27:35.852 --> 27:39.187
while I'm king, Olympia.
And though we are friends,

27:39.189 --> 27:41.889
I must be there
first and foremost

27:41.891 --> 27:44.161
for all of my subjects.

27:45.161 --> 27:48.832
- This is not gonna end well.
- Uh-uh.

27:49.366 --> 27:52.036
Okay, so how do I find Dexter?

27:52.235 --> 27:54.869
His plane crashed,
so the only way out of here is...

27:54.871 --> 27:56.306
- [helicopter whirring]
- Huh?

27:56.873 --> 27:59.810
Helicopter.
My helicopter!

28:02.980 --> 28:05.383
[laughs]

28:15.259 --> 28:18.296
[pants]

28:21.232 --> 28:22.267
[grunts]

28:25.969 --> 28:27.469
- [sighs]
- [chittering]

28:27.471 --> 28:28.506
Huh?

28:40.117 --> 28:41.985
[phone ringing]

28:51.896 --> 28:54.930
- Hello?
- Norm, how is it going?

28:54.932 --> 28:56.197
[Norm] Oh, fine.

28:56.199 --> 28:59.003
Just hanging out
on Fong's helicopter.

28:59.203 --> 29:00.668
Did you get the artifact back?

29:00.670 --> 29:03.338
It's practically
right in my paws.

29:03.340 --> 29:04.509
How's it going there?

29:05.676 --> 29:08.443
Well, Quinn is really taking
his job of being in charge

29:08.445 --> 29:09.914
pretty seriously.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.986
[grunting]

29:21.926 --> 29:24.126
I'm supposed to handle
some of the food stuff.

29:24.128 --> 29:25.163
Quinn wanted me to ask

29:26.296 --> 29:27.231
<i>what kind of fish you prefer
for the main course.</i>

29:28.998 --> 29:30.968
No. No. No. Ow. My butt!

29:31.334 --> 29:33.403
Huh? What is, "Ow-my-butt"?

29:34.437 --> 29:37.507
No, no. I said, um, halibut!

29:39.009 --> 29:40.442
It's my halibut song.

29:40.444 --> 29:42.277
It's a, you know, I sing...

29:42.279 --> 29:44.512
Oh... [imitates static]
Bad connection. Sorry.

29:44.514 --> 29:46.251
Uh... [imitates static]
Bye.

29:46.483 --> 29:47.652
[dial tone]

29:48.519 --> 29:49.554
Uh-uh.

29:52.555 --> 29:53.891
[sniffs]

29:54.324 --> 29:57.326
[groans] You call
these salmon eggs fresh?

29:57.328 --> 29:59.427
And they're not
free range either.

29:59.429 --> 30:01.599
- Throw them all out.
- [groans]

30:03.000 --> 30:06.434
I knew this would happen.
Give him a little power...

30:06.436 --> 30:08.270
[polar bear]
You're not the boss of me.

30:08.272 --> 30:12.240
No, I'm not.
I'm the boss of everyone.

30:12.242 --> 30:14.209
Oh, he just loves to play

30:14.211 --> 30:16.478
the next-in-line-to-the-throne
card.

30:16.480 --> 30:19.080
Listen up, everyone,
with Dad away,

30:19.082 --> 30:20.415
I'm calling the shots.

30:20.417 --> 30:22.684
I am next in line to the throne.

30:22.686 --> 30:25.156
- You think?
- [groans]

30:30.360 --> 30:31.462
[teeth chattering]

30:32.463 --> 30:34.261
Hey, lemmings,
I know the fresh air is great,

30:34.263 --> 30:36.397
but I can't help but feel
it would be more comfy

30:36.399 --> 30:38.101
inside the helicopter.

30:38.468 --> 30:40.138
[lemmings chittering]

30:53.183 --> 30:54.252
[door whirs]

30:56.419 --> 30:58.589
[grunts]

31:05.228 --> 31:06.627
[laughs]

31:06.629 --> 31:08.699
Oh, there you are, my precious.

31:19.475 --> 31:22.411
- Dexter here. Yes?
- [indistinct radio chatter]

31:22.413 --> 31:24.378
Yes, I've got it
and I'll be landing

31:24.380 --> 31:26.114
in Beijing in a few hours.

31:26.116 --> 31:28.485
[indistinct radio chatter]

31:29.086 --> 31:31.653
Just make sure you
and the other buyers

31:31.655 --> 31:33.657
have your checkbooks ready.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.326
[indistinct radio chatter]

31:35.591 --> 31:37.692
Going to Beijing, perfect!

31:37.694 --> 31:39.828
That's where Jin's grandson,
Chen, lives.

31:39.830 --> 31:42.731
I just have to grab the artifact
when the time is right.

31:42.733 --> 31:44.433
Which means this king
is gonna take

31:44.435 --> 31:46.404
a royal nap until then.

31:46.837 --> 31:49.140
[sighs] Wake me
when we're getting close.

31:53.142 --> 31:54.244
[sighs]

32:00.250 --> 32:03.186
[snoring]

32:05.822 --> 32:07.155
[all] Ah.

32:07.157 --> 32:09.159
[snores]

32:24.574 --> 32:25.509
Hmm?

32:27.644 --> 32:28.646
Blimey!

32:31.115 --> 32:33.251
Altitude must be getting to me.

32:33.617 --> 32:36.087
[chittering]

32:40.791 --> 32:42.260
Hmm.

32:44.227 --> 32:45.395
Aha!

32:46.696 --> 32:48.363
No! No!

32:48.365 --> 32:50.835
[groans]

32:54.871 --> 32:57.074
[grunts]

33:03.847 --> 33:07.515
I bet you pack of snow rats
aren't alone, are you?

33:07.517 --> 33:09.453
- [Norm snoring]
- [gasps]

33:12.523 --> 33:14.358
[laughs]

33:19.830 --> 33:20.831
Toodleydoo.

33:30.741 --> 33:32.507
[laughs]

33:32.509 --> 33:34.645
[groans]

33:38.948 --> 33:40.851
[laughs]

33:44.454 --> 33:45.455
- Huh?
- [door rattles]

33:46.523 --> 33:48.525
[chittering]

33:53.964 --> 33:55.633
[Dexter screams]

34:09.279 --> 34:10.748
Huh?
[yawns]

34:12.382 --> 34:13.618
[sniffs]
Huh?

34:14.750 --> 34:16.219
Mm.

34:17.621 --> 34:19.157
Don't mind if I do.

34:20.590 --> 34:21.822
[sighs]

34:21.824 --> 34:23.360
Crazy dream I had.

34:28.531 --> 34:29.565
Oh, no.

34:33.904 --> 34:36.741
[grunts]

34:41.545 --> 34:42.580
[screams]

34:43.746 --> 34:45.215
[chittering]

34:52.389 --> 34:53.591
[Dexter screaming]

34:53.790 --> 34:55.625
[groans]

34:58.561 --> 35:01.232
Lemming's piloting,
never a good thing.

35:06.737 --> 35:07.905
[screams]

35:08.304 --> 35:10.207
[screaming]

35:13.442 --> 35:16.379
Got to get back on there.
How am I gonna do that?

35:17.614 --> 35:18.516
Huh?

35:34.730 --> 35:36.833
[groans]

35:42.038 --> 35:43.741
Oh!

35:45.542 --> 35:48.846
- [phone ringing]
- [groans] My head is ringing.

35:53.449 --> 35:56.020
Norm residence,
whom shall I say is calling?

35:56.585 --> 35:58.555
Norm, you sound funny.

35:58.889 --> 36:00.054
How's it going?

36:00.056 --> 36:02.357
[Norm] <i>Great,
very relaxing trip.</i>

36:02.359 --> 36:04.692
Tell Fong his helicopter
is in good hands.

36:04.694 --> 36:06.596
Good, tiny hands.

36:07.331 --> 36:10.601
I thought we discussed this?
No phone calls.

36:11.467 --> 36:12.736
You got to obey your king.

36:13.069 --> 36:15.003
You're not my king, Quinn.

36:15.005 --> 36:17.739
And anyhow,
you're only acting king.

36:17.741 --> 36:20.277
And kinda
acting like a jerk on top of it.

36:20.610 --> 36:22.780
- I am?
- [seal barks]

36:23.080 --> 36:26.449
Oh. Nevertheless,
I am to be obeyed.

36:26.717 --> 36:27.652
"Nevertheless?"

36:28.418 --> 36:31.355
What kind of bear says
words like nevertheless?

36:38.627 --> 36:41.364
[grunts]

37:06.656 --> 37:07.991
[squeals]

37:10.726 --> 37:11.929
[laughs]

37:19.536 --> 37:20.705
What the...

37:24.440 --> 37:26.042
Climb!

37:29.478 --> 37:31.348
[grunts]

37:34.016 --> 37:35.051
[grunts]

37:41.023 --> 37:43.860
[groans]

37:47.697 --> 37:49.032
Whoa!

37:49.632 --> 37:50.967
[grunts]

38:04.714 --> 38:05.882
Whoa! [grunts]

38:06.081 --> 38:09.119
[phone ringing]

38:10.152 --> 38:11.753
King Norm here, at the tone,

38:11.755 --> 38:13.020
please leave your name
and number

38:13.022 --> 38:14.087
- and...
- [Olympia] <i>Hey!</i>

38:14.089 --> 38:15.625
<i>Norm, it's me again.</i>

38:15.926 --> 38:17.958
Quinn keeps confiscating
my phone.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.729
This is so stressful.

38:20.697 --> 38:23.768
Out of the way, lemmings,
King Quinn coming through.

38:26.802 --> 38:27.804
[screams]

38:29.605 --> 38:30.540
[splash]

38:32.208 --> 38:33.974
[Quinn groans]

38:33.976 --> 38:36.513
[laughing]

38:36.913 --> 38:38.947
[Olympia] <i>You have no idea
how easy you've got it.</i>

38:38.949 --> 38:40.551
Yup, lucky me.

38:45.721 --> 38:46.820
[laughs]

38:46.822 --> 38:48.188
[gasps]

38:48.190 --> 38:50.060
Here's Normy!

38:51.828 --> 38:53.730
Oh, no! [grunts]

38:54.663 --> 38:57.033
Now, where's the artifact?

38:57.667 --> 38:59.936
Somewhere you'll never find it.

39:01.237 --> 39:04.174
[chittering]

39:11.281 --> 39:14.083
[both grunting]

39:23.826 --> 39:24.962
[grunting]

39:25.529 --> 39:27.697
[Norm grunts]

39:30.734 --> 39:33.503
- [crashing]
- [Norm and Dexter groaning]

39:36.572 --> 39:37.775
[groans]

39:40.610 --> 39:42.112
You want it, don't you?

39:45.281 --> 39:47.050
Well, let's see how much.

39:50.719 --> 39:52.889
No! You wouldn't dare drop it.

39:53.690 --> 39:55.559
Hmm, you're right.

39:58.228 --> 40:00.030
But I'd sure throw it!

40:01.130 --> 40:03.734
No!
[screams]

40:09.272 --> 40:12.676
Or pretend to anyhow.
[laughs]

40:14.344 --> 40:17.181
The old lemming
dodge ball fake throw.

40:19.049 --> 40:21.118
[screams]

40:22.052 --> 40:23.153
[gasps]

40:39.935 --> 40:42.972
Fooled by a stupid bear.
[grunts]

40:49.746 --> 40:52.550
Those sacks
would make for a soft landing.

40:56.085 --> 40:57.321
- [wind howls]
- Wind.

40:57.953 --> 40:59.055
[Dexter screams]

41:06.696 --> 41:08.299
Any landing's a good landing.

41:09.232 --> 41:10.567
[groans]

41:11.266 --> 41:12.669
[growls]

41:17.373 --> 41:18.741
[laughs]

41:19.141 --> 41:20.675
Next stop, Beijing.

41:20.677 --> 41:22.976
Drop off the artifact to Chen
at the university,

41:22.978 --> 41:25.712
then fly home in plenty of time
for the Aurora Borealis

41:25.714 --> 41:27.382
and Grandpa's wedding.

41:27.384 --> 41:29.983
Never flew one these
kinda copters before.

41:29.985 --> 41:34.725
But how hard can it be?
Whoa!

41:38.994 --> 41:41.362
You three, now that
you've cleared the area,

41:41.364 --> 41:43.965
I need you to smooth it out
for a dance floor.

41:43.967 --> 41:45.735
Flat, but not slippery.

41:50.005 --> 41:50.904
Fong...

41:50.906 --> 41:53.373
Oh, I already know
what my job will be.

41:53.375 --> 41:54.976
I will make a sculpture

41:54.978 --> 41:58.145
of the beautiful
bride and groom.

41:58.147 --> 41:59.282
You can sculpt?

41:59.915 --> 42:02.750
That is how I earned a living
while in business school.

42:02.752 --> 42:04.418
You know the Statue of Liberty?

42:04.420 --> 42:06.253
You sculpted that?

42:06.255 --> 42:09.023
Uh, no, but I could see it
from my window

42:09.025 --> 42:11.259
- at business school.
- Get Mr. Fong

42:11.261 --> 42:12.996
a block of ice to sculpt.

42:15.464 --> 42:17.700
[sawing]

42:30.447 --> 42:31.782
[seal barks]

42:41.257 --> 42:42.960
Too messy and random.

42:43.927 --> 42:45.696
Make it neat and fancy.

42:46.362 --> 42:49.667
We're not barbarians after all.

42:52.768 --> 42:55.436
[music playing]

42:55.438 --> 42:57.241
Chase, how is the music coming?

42:57.473 --> 42:59.940
Well, thanks to Mr. Fong,
we got a whole

42:59.942 --> 43:01.842
human sound system set up.

43:01.844 --> 43:05.348
Check it out. I downloaded
some majorly awesome beats.

43:05.915 --> 43:10.154
[music gets louder]

43:11.154 --> 43:12.121
[both] Huh?

43:24.266 --> 43:27.270
- Oh, yeah! You feel me?
- [music stops]

43:27.469 --> 43:28.203
[equipment screeches]

43:29.371 --> 43:31.207
- [Quinn] I hate it.
- [groaning]

43:32.074 --> 43:33.777
Too undignified.

43:41.317 --> 43:44.050
Hey, you lemmings
have been pretty quiet lately.

43:44.052 --> 43:46.924
You just resting and enjoying
the flight? [chuckles]

43:48.056 --> 43:50.293
[vomiting]

43:59.435 --> 44:02.072
Now,
where can that university be?

44:02.572 --> 44:03.774
Hey.

44:05.174 --> 44:08.144
Excuse me,
how do I get to the university?

44:08.478 --> 44:12.014
Study. Lots and lots of study.

44:26.429 --> 44:28.831
Hey, there it is.

44:29.199 --> 44:31.032
No wonder
they call it an institution

44:31.034 --> 44:33.567
of higher learning,
it's up on a hill.

44:33.569 --> 44:36.003
[laughs] Hey, get it?
[laughs]

44:36.005 --> 44:37.941
[stomachs churning]

44:38.308 --> 44:40.043
Nothing, really?

44:41.310 --> 44:42.311
[groaning]

44:43.179 --> 44:44.248
[vomiting]

44:54.523 --> 44:58.058
So, anybody know
how to land this thing?

44:58.060 --> 45:01.397
- [chittering]
- I'll take that as a no.

45:01.864 --> 45:03.833
Ah, how hard could it be?

45:11.273 --> 45:15.279
[beeping]

45:15.645 --> 45:17.480
We're good, we're good,
we're good.

45:18.281 --> 45:21.514
Here we go.
I'll just ease this baby down

45:21.516 --> 45:23.085
onto to the... Whoa!

45:26.154 --> 45:27.156
[groans]

45:28.223 --> 45:29.359
Everybody okay?

45:29.592 --> 45:31.061
- [lemmings groaning]
- Hmm?

45:32.127 --> 45:34.363
[squeak]

45:34.663 --> 45:35.598
Huh?

45:42.672 --> 45:44.438
[Chen] Now,
in our study of archaeology,

45:44.440 --> 45:46.373
we've discussed many treasures,

45:46.375 --> 45:49.912
but this artifact
is the most special of all.

45:50.480 --> 45:54.985
[indistinct chatter]

45:57.052 --> 45:59.388
By placing the artifact
in its sacred spot,

45:59.589 --> 46:01.489
one can gain access
to the treasures

46:01.491 --> 46:04.360
housed within the
Mountain of Nine Cauldrons

46:04.627 --> 46:06.927
for thousands of years.

46:06.929 --> 46:09.132
[man] How come no one's
ever seen these treasures?

46:09.598 --> 46:13.067
Nobody has seen them
in your lifetime or mine,

46:13.069 --> 46:15.438
but that is about
to change tonight.

46:16.438 --> 46:20.141
The ancient emperors
used the magic of 17 sorcerers,

46:20.143 --> 46:22.944
so that the people would be able
to gaze upon its contents

46:22.946 --> 46:25.514
just once every 100 years.

46:26.281 --> 46:29.416
For one day and night,
from sunset to sunset,

46:29.418 --> 46:32.018
the mountain reveals
the nine tripod cauldrons

46:32.020 --> 46:34.422
and all the other treasures
of our ancestors.

46:34.424 --> 46:36.056
[crowd gasping]

46:36.058 --> 46:38.458
And the key to the mountain
revealing itself

46:38.460 --> 46:40.460
is this artifact.

46:40.462 --> 46:43.364
[man] So, where is the artifact
now then?

46:43.366 --> 46:46.166
Well, it's been on display
in a museum in Canada,

46:46.168 --> 46:48.636
but I have every confidence
it will be back here

46:48.638 --> 46:50.107
before sunset.

46:51.540 --> 46:54.210
[sighs] I know you'll make it
back in time, Grandfather.

46:54.476 --> 46:55.543
I just know it.

46:55.545 --> 46:57.110
- [bell ringing]
- Huh?

46:57.112 --> 46:58.212
Uh, class dismissed.

46:58.214 --> 47:01.918
[indistinct chatter]

47:02.518 --> 47:04.186
[Norm] Oh, oh, pardon me.

47:04.554 --> 47:06.020
All right,
let's scoot over here.

47:06.022 --> 47:07.355
Pardon me. You all right there?

47:07.357 --> 47:10.190
Oh, journey complete, lemmings.

47:10.192 --> 47:14.261
A king always keeps his word
and we've delivered the artifact

47:14.263 --> 47:17.000
safe and...
[screams]

47:24.306 --> 47:25.475
[Norm screams]

47:29.244 --> 47:30.279
[groans]

47:32.081 --> 47:33.183
[brays]

47:34.384 --> 47:37.286
As I was saying, safe and sound.

47:42.225 --> 47:43.226
Ah!

47:47.797 --> 47:50.797
Professor Chen, I presume?

47:50.799 --> 47:53.034
No. My... Nobody named Chen.

47:53.036 --> 47:54.335
You must have
the wrong classroom.

47:54.337 --> 47:56.739
[woman] Professor Chen,
I will see you tomorrow.

47:58.273 --> 47:59.572
Hey, I get it,

47:59.574 --> 48:02.143
you don't get many talking
polar bears around here.

48:02.145 --> 48:04.512
But relax,
I have something for you.

48:04.514 --> 48:07.117
No, I don't want it.
I want nothing from you.

48:07.717 --> 48:10.351
It's not from me,
it's from your grandfather, Jin.

48:10.353 --> 48:12.619
My grandfather is nothing
but an old fool.

48:12.621 --> 48:14.154
And a thief
who steals artifacts.

48:14.156 --> 48:15.391
Now, please, go away.

48:15.657 --> 48:17.824
You got that wrong,
your granddad's a good guy,

48:17.826 --> 48:20.561
but I tell you,
there's this guy named Dexter,

48:20.563 --> 48:24.264
now, he's the real thief
and a lowlife, a terrible guy.

48:24.266 --> 48:25.733
If you ever see him
coming your way,

48:25.735 --> 48:27.735
cross the street,
do not look back.

48:27.737 --> 48:31.304
- [clears throat]
- Anyhow, I gave my word,

48:31.306 --> 48:32.375
so here.

48:34.844 --> 48:36.777
I have forgotten
how beautiful it is.

48:36.779 --> 48:38.512
[Dexter] Isn't it, though?

48:38.514 --> 48:40.681
[snarling]

48:40.683 --> 48:42.753
[Dexter laughs]

48:48.723 --> 48:53.496
Allow me to introduce you
to Chaos and Mayhem.

48:53.763 --> 48:56.697
- Komodo dragons.
- Oh, yeah.

48:56.699 --> 48:59.101
I saw their baby pictures.

48:59.534 --> 49:01.168
They grow up so fast.

49:01.170 --> 49:03.139
[snarling]

49:04.540 --> 49:05.641
[whimpering]

49:06.442 --> 49:07.511
[farts]

49:08.610 --> 49:09.545
[sniffs]

49:10.112 --> 49:13.817
[farting]

49:15.118 --> 49:16.420
[chuckles, gags]

49:17.652 --> 49:18.554
[groans]

49:22.157 --> 49:23.690
Bravo.

49:23.692 --> 49:26.462
Oh, I say,
you do know your reptiles.

49:26.795 --> 49:29.596
Then you're well aware
that the Komodos

49:29.598 --> 49:31.831
are unabashed carnivores.

49:31.833 --> 49:34.434
Feeding on creatures
as small as mice

49:34.436 --> 49:36.205
and as large as deer.

49:37.272 --> 49:39.572
Or even humans, for that matter.

49:39.574 --> 49:41.641
Yeah, well, not polar bears.

49:41.643 --> 49:44.180
No. Well, not yet anyway.

49:44.413 --> 49:48.452
They tend to live too far south
to ever have encountered one.

49:48.918 --> 49:52.520
Oh, but Chaos seems
rather interested

49:52.522 --> 49:54.690
in sampling a new dish.
[laughs]

49:55.290 --> 49:57.693
Mayhem, the artifact.

50:05.333 --> 50:07.367
I was trying to signal you
to go away.

50:07.369 --> 50:09.235
Dexter had his weapon on me
the whole time.

50:09.237 --> 50:11.271
No wonder
you were acting all fidgety.

50:11.273 --> 50:13.210
I thought
it was the bear thing.

50:13.509 --> 50:17.114
My Komodos will stay behind
and keep you company.

50:17.712 --> 50:22.650
They have their instructions,
one move and they attack.

50:22.652 --> 50:25.552
And you don't want that.

50:25.554 --> 50:27.556
[snarling]

50:29.192 --> 50:31.824
Dexter, you and my grandfather
were partners.

50:31.826 --> 50:33.826
You respected
the world's artifacts.

50:33.828 --> 50:36.563
The treasures of the mountain
belong to the people.

50:36.565 --> 50:40.302
And as I told your grandfather,
I'm a people.

50:40.603 --> 50:42.969
And they will all be mine.

50:42.971 --> 50:45.207
Komodos... <i>Fassen!</i>

50:45.473 --> 50:48.811
[snarling]

50:49.779 --> 50:52.349
Toodle-ooh.
[laughs]

50:54.382 --> 50:55.317
[door opens]

50:56.451 --> 50:58.619
Dexter will head for the
mountain and use the artifact

50:58.621 --> 51:00.788
to gain entry and rob it blind.

51:00.790 --> 51:03.489
Well, then we just
got to stop him.

51:03.491 --> 51:06.629
How? Those are Komodo dragons
and they mean business.

51:07.263 --> 51:08.297
They're deadly.

51:09.665 --> 51:12.168
Yeah, and they eat animals.

51:12.500 --> 51:17.273
Bet they never tasted anything
as delicious as lemmings.

51:17.873 --> 51:21.608
They're so tender and tasty.

51:21.610 --> 51:24.578
They're both sweet and sour.

51:24.580 --> 51:28.585
Crispy on the outside,
creamy on the inside.

51:40.996 --> 51:43.332
Woo! Way to go, lemmings.

51:46.534 --> 51:47.536
[thud]

51:50.639 --> 51:52.641
[automated voice] <i>Log entry,

51:53.375 --> 51:55.844

51:57.712 --> 52:00.649
- [screaming]
- Lemmings!

52:11.661 --> 52:12.596

52:16.531 --> 52:18.934

52:26.509 --> 52:29.246

- [snarling]

53:01.076 --> 53:04.281
[boat engine revving]

53:21.429 --> 53:22.695
[Chen] The river leads right to

53:22.697 --> 53:24.466
the Mountain
of the Nine Cauldrons.

53:24.900 --> 53:26.632
Look, I've had no time
to ask you,

53:26.634 --> 53:28.134
but my grandfather,

53:28.136 --> 53:30.306
why didn't he return
the artifact himself?

53:30.605 --> 53:32.105
Oh, well, uh, that's because

53:32.107 --> 53:33.942
he was a little
under the weather.

53:34.442 --> 53:36.744
Because of, uh,
a cave-in, uh, mostly,

53:36.746 --> 53:38.615
and being trapped all night
in the freezing cave

53:38.848 --> 53:40.884
and then he kind of passed out,
so he might be unconscious

53:41.116 --> 53:43.819
or, uh, I don't know, um,
in a coma?

53:44.386 --> 53:46.018
What? Will he make it?

53:46.020 --> 53:47.356
Sure he will.

53:48.089 --> 53:49.825
[monkeys chatter]

53:52.060 --> 53:53.962
Ow, what? Oh.

53:54.462 --> 53:56.496
[monkeys howling]

53:56.498 --> 54:00.536
Hey. Ow! Cut it...
[grunts]

54:16.118 --> 54:20.657
Hmm, mm, oh. Mm. Oh, tasty.

54:28.730 --> 54:30.499
Huh? Wow!

54:34.469 --> 54:35.504
Woohoo!

54:41.710 --> 54:45.014
[monkeys chatter]

54:54.857 --> 54:56.223
Hey there, little buddy.

54:56.225 --> 54:57.993
Oh, I see you brought
your friends.

54:58.927 --> 55:02.398
- [chittering]
- [chatting]

55:16.244 --> 55:17.744
Look! Dexter.

55:17.746 --> 55:19.045
I'm Norm.

55:19.047 --> 55:22.616
- No. I mean, look, Dexter.
- Oh.

55:22.618 --> 55:24.587
- [helicopter whirs]
- Oh.

55:24.920 --> 55:26.623
[chatters]

55:32.494 --> 55:34.431
Oh, I doubt we can beat him
to the mountain.

55:35.063 --> 55:36.496
Not at this speed.

55:36.498 --> 55:38.868
[engine revs]

55:39.902 --> 55:42.539
[chittering]

55:52.281 --> 55:54.750
- [screaming]
- Look out!

56:06.728 --> 56:09.061
[sighs] I knew something bad
must've happened.

56:09.063 --> 56:10.898
He made a sacred vow
that he would bring

56:10.900 --> 56:12.632
the artifact back to Beijing,

56:12.634 --> 56:14.233
in time for the 100-year opening

56:14.235 --> 56:16.235
of the Mountain
of the Nine Cauldrons.

56:16.237 --> 56:18.971
- He gave his word.
- But then he made me

56:18.973 --> 56:21.208
give my word
that I'd get the artifact to you

56:21.210 --> 56:23.844
if he couldn't, and I did.

56:23.846 --> 56:25.815
So it's kind of like him
keeping his word.

56:26.014 --> 56:28.748
Sure, except that now
Dexter has the artifact.

56:28.750 --> 56:30.750
And if it gets to the mountain
before we do

56:30.752 --> 56:33.654
- and steals all its treasures...
- That won't happen.

56:33.656 --> 56:36.690
When a king, that's me,
gives his word, which I did,

56:36.692 --> 56:39.759
- then nothing is gonna stop him.
- [fog horn blaring]

56:39.761 --> 56:42.228
Except for maybe that!
Look out!

56:42.230 --> 56:44.566
Look out! Look...
[screams]

56:46.668 --> 56:49.001
Uncle Stan, you should be
rehearsing the wedding song,

56:49.003 --> 56:52.139
not, uh...
What are you doing anyway?

56:52.141 --> 56:54.143
[gargling]

56:55.777 --> 56:57.777
Uh, gargling with ice water.

56:57.779 --> 56:59.548
It's good for my instrument.

57:01.951 --> 57:03.183
- Fine.
- [seal farts]

57:03.185 --> 57:04.920
The rehearsal starts
in 10 minutes.

57:05.753 --> 57:07.089
[gargling]

57:07.822 --> 57:09.025
[Quinn shrieks]

57:09.357 --> 57:10.926
Oh, no!

57:12.795 --> 57:15.298
[groaning]

57:43.192 --> 57:44.858
The only way
to access the treasure

57:44.860 --> 57:47.330
is to land at its base
and climb to the cavern opening.

57:47.996 --> 57:49.665
Then we can beat him there.

57:50.098 --> 57:51.734
Lemmings, do your thing.

57:52.101 --> 57:54.070
[chittering]

58:06.915 --> 58:09.349
You can't run a boat on land,
it has no wheels.

58:09.351 --> 58:11.250
The laws of physics
make it impossible.

58:11.252 --> 58:15.057
I'm a king, I don't obey laws,
I make them.

58:20.895 --> 58:23.031
[screaming]

58:24.333 --> 58:26.936
[lemmings screaming]

58:27.770 --> 58:29.072
[groaning]

58:35.677 --> 58:37.911
Dexter's not
gonna climb up to the cavern,

58:37.913 --> 58:39.382
he's gonna climb down to it.

59:22.123 --> 59:23.058
Climb aboard.

59:24.393 --> 59:27.295
He takes the high road,
we take the low road.

59:45.013 --> 59:46.181
Hang on tight.

59:47.782 --> 59:50.853

Norm, I forgot to ask,

01:00:36.264 --> 01:00:38.134
do you want iceberg
lettuce salad,

01:00:39.134 --> 01:00:41.170
or cream of snow soup
for your first course?

01:00:41.369 --> 01:00:44.304
- [Norm] Either one is fine.

<i>Why is your voice so weird?</i>

01:00:46.375 --> 01:00:49.177
[Norm] Probably bad signal
on your mountain.

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:52.012
Oh, hey, Norm, just FYI,

01:00:52.014 --> 01:00:54.380
the Aurora Borealis
isn't too many hours away,

01:00:54.382 --> 01:00:55.549
and you need to get back,

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:59.251
so I can get some footage
of you and the happy couple

01:00:59.253 --> 01:01:01.857
just as it begins to rise
in the background.

01:01:02.089 --> 01:01:03.925
Right, I'll do my best.

01:01:06.194 --> 01:01:07.960
Oh, we may have to post
this wedding video online.

01:01:07.962 --> 01:01:10.230
Something tells me it's gonna be
the Arctic Tundra's

01:01:10.232 --> 01:01:12.565
social event of the year.

01:01:12.567 --> 01:01:15.569
Uh, Mom, it's going to be
the Arctic Tundra's

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:17.773
only social event of the year.

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:22.375

signal's breaking up.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.081
Lyrics?

01:02:33.547 --> 01:02:34.549
Seriously?

01:02:35.317 --> 01:02:36.252
[phone beeps]

01:02:37.219 --> 01:02:39.920
How many times
must I tell you, no phones!

01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:41.424
There's still work to do!

01:02:43.225 --> 01:02:44.860
Oh, for the love of...

01:02:45.092 --> 01:02:46.094
[screams]

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:52.034
[lemmings chittering]

01:02:53.935 --> 01:02:54.936
[groans]

01:03:01.442 --> 01:03:03.245
[grunts]

01:03:24.398 --> 01:03:25.400
Wait, Norm.

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:28.270
I just remembered something
my grandfather told me.

01:03:28.536 --> 01:03:31.570
This corridor is protected
by ancient booby traps.

01:03:31.572 --> 01:03:32.639
You sure?

01:03:32.641 --> 01:03:34.110
Then how did Dexter...

01:03:35.377 --> 01:03:36.378
[screams]

01:03:39.514 --> 01:03:41.083
Oh, oh, oh.

01:03:48.056 --> 01:03:53.996
Close. [yelps] Too close,
too close. Whoa. Oh!

01:03:54.228 --> 01:03:55.230
[pants]

01:03:56.297 --> 01:03:57.630
Okay, I think you're right
about the booby-traps.

01:03:57.632 --> 01:03:59.331
Dexter knew how to avoid them.

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:00.733
As would my grandfather.

01:04:00.735 --> 01:04:02.534
Uh, maybe Olympia
can get him on the phone

01:04:02.536 --> 01:04:05.438
- and, uh... Oh, no signal.
- [phone beeps]

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.706
Uh, uh, but, hey,

01:04:06.708 --> 01:04:09.011
a couple of smart guys like us,
we can do this.

01:04:24.426 --> 01:04:28.094
It says,
"Yin or yang, choose wisely."

01:04:28.096 --> 01:04:30.262
Huh. I think it means
you either step

01:04:30.264 --> 01:04:31.364
only on the red stones

01:04:31.366 --> 01:04:35.304
- or on the blue stones.
- Well, that narrows it down.

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:45.512
Okay, so we've ruled out
stepping on the red stones.

01:04:45.514 --> 01:04:47.616
Ipso facto, blue means go.

01:04:53.154 --> 01:04:54.156
[groans]

01:05:03.764 --> 01:05:05.533
No? Okay, no.
I don't know, I'm okay.

01:05:12.139 --> 01:05:13.208
[lemmings whimper]

01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:40.169
[screams]

01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:44.205
[whimpering]

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:47.442
[grunts]

01:05:50.145 --> 01:05:51.781
[sighs]
That was close.

01:05:59.386 --> 01:06:01.523
Oh, you know, I think that's it
for the booby traps.

01:06:02.757 --> 01:06:04.293
[clicking, rumbling]

01:06:05.759 --> 01:06:06.694
[screaming]

01:06:09.464 --> 01:06:11.199
Okay, so maybe not.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:13.532
[gasps]

01:06:13.534 --> 01:06:15.670
- [metal clanking]
- Don't move.

01:06:19.907 --> 01:06:21.243
Oh, come on.

01:06:36.590 --> 01:06:38.891
Okay, that's it, right?
[sighs]

01:06:38.893 --> 01:06:41.927
[Dexter] Oh, Chen, bravo!

01:06:41.929 --> 01:06:47.435
You and your circus bear,
managing to survive the traps.

01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:50.302
Circus bear?
I'm sure that's an insult,

01:06:50.304 --> 01:06:53.542
- but I'm not sure why.
- Don't do it, Dexter.

01:06:53.842 --> 01:06:56.308
My grandfather told me
you were once an honorable

01:06:56.310 --> 01:06:57.412
and good man.

01:06:57.746 --> 01:07:00.547
[Dexter] Oh, yes.
Good and poor.

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:03.349
But then I saw
the error of my ways.

01:07:03.351 --> 01:07:05.351
These silly antiquities

01:07:05.353 --> 01:07:07.755
are worth a fortune
to collectors.

01:07:10.257 --> 01:07:11.791
So you sold out your partner,

01:07:11.793 --> 01:07:13.826
his entire country,
and your principles

01:07:13.828 --> 01:07:16.895
- for a little money?
- No, a lot of money.

01:07:16.897 --> 01:07:18.831
The treasures contained
in this mountain

01:07:18.833 --> 01:07:20.703
are worth a fortune!

01:07:21.802 --> 01:07:22.804
[snarling]

01:07:27.342 --> 01:07:28.544
[gasps]

01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:31.311
[Dexter chuckles]

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:33.616
Of course you remember
Chaos and Mayhem.

01:07:34.281 --> 01:07:37.650
Hmm, seems that
whatever you did to them earlier

01:07:37.652 --> 01:07:39.251
has made them eager

01:07:39.253 --> 01:07:42.387
- for some payback.
- [Chen] Wait, it won't work.

01:07:42.389 --> 01:07:44.893
It's not sunset,
it's not time yet.

01:07:45.460 --> 01:07:49.262
Oh, on the contrary,
it's the perfect time.

01:07:49.264 --> 01:07:51.965
You see, the mountain
is already starting to glow,

01:07:51.967 --> 01:07:55.237
and that means
it's right for the plucking.

01:07:55.469 --> 01:07:59.641
And there's nothing
you can do to stop me.

01:08:00.308 --> 01:08:01.377
Oh, yeah?

01:08:01.976 --> 01:08:03.645
[grunts]

01:08:12.353 --> 01:08:13.589
Oh, I should have mentioned,

01:08:13.822 --> 01:08:16.020
there's a trap or two
that you missed.

01:08:16.023 --> 01:08:17.493
[laughs]

01:08:18.459 --> 01:08:20.295
[snarling]

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:31.305
[grunts]

01:08:37.611 --> 01:08:39.314
[laughs]

01:08:46.754 --> 01:08:47.755
No.

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:52.361
Huh?

01:08:53.027 --> 01:08:53.962
[murmurs]

01:08:55.663 --> 01:08:56.732
[grunts]

01:08:59.633 --> 01:09:01.368
What is wrong with this thing?

01:09:01.602 --> 01:09:03.301
Maybe it needs new batteries.

01:09:03.304 --> 01:09:04.272
[laughs]

01:09:05.572 --> 01:09:07.942
Wait.
He's right.

01:09:08.509 --> 01:09:10.812
They're in ancient Mandarin.

01:09:11.545 --> 01:09:13.845
"Herein lie the Nine Cauldrons

01:09:13.846 --> 01:09:16.484
and the treasures
of the ancient emperors.

01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:19.350
Their beauty to be gazed upon,

01:09:19.353 --> 01:09:22.557
but once every 100 years."

01:09:22.923 --> 01:09:27.828
All right. So open up
and show me the beauty.

01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:35.638
You didn't read the fine print.

01:09:36.904 --> 01:09:39.340
What? This gibberish?

01:09:42.977 --> 01:09:44.344
[gasps]

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:45.478
It's the secret language

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:47.515
of the ancient emperors
themselves.

01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:49.849
I don't know that language.

01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:51.951
[Norm] Ooh, sounds like someone

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:54.019
wasn't paying attention
in class that day.

01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.523
[lemmings] Mm-hmm.

01:09:56.090 --> 01:09:58.427
"The Nine Cauldrons
represent honor,

01:09:58.793 --> 01:10:02.862
so to only a person of honor,
in both word and deed,

01:10:02.864 --> 01:10:05.534
may access the treasure
within the mountain."

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:08.667
Your old-time emperors
were just like ours.

01:10:08.669 --> 01:10:10.737
We always keep our word.

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.708
Looks like
you're out of luck, Dexter.

01:10:12.973 --> 01:10:16.611
Since you have no honor,
the mountain has rejected you.

01:10:17.111 --> 01:10:21.546
But you, Chen, goody two-shoes,

01:10:21.548 --> 01:10:23.683
such a man of honor.

01:10:23.685 --> 01:10:26.321
Surely, it will open for you.

01:10:26.521 --> 01:10:27.923
[phone ringing]

01:10:30.525 --> 01:10:31.991
Yeah, that's my phone.

01:10:31.993 --> 01:10:34.025
Uh, sorry, guys.
I need to take this.

01:10:34.027 --> 01:10:35.795
Uh, hey. Hey.
Uh, no.

01:10:35.797 --> 01:10:37.162
Uh, I really can't talk,
but everything's...

01:10:37.164 --> 01:10:38.366
- [gunshot]
- Ow.

01:10:43.538 --> 01:10:45.674
Sure doesn't sound
like everything's okay.

01:10:45.906 --> 01:10:48.377
[groans]

01:10:50.911 --> 01:10:54.046
- Tick tock, Chen, do it!
- [snarling]

01:10:54.048 --> 01:10:55.751
No, I won't.

01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:58.451
- Good for you, Chen.
- You're willing

01:10:58.453 --> 01:11:01.522
to give your life
to deprive me of the treasure.

01:11:01.856 --> 01:11:05.027
- On the other hand...
- [snarling]

01:11:37.859 --> 01:11:38.861
Okay.

01:11:39.127 --> 01:11:40.659
This is weird.

01:11:40.661 --> 01:11:42.964
These big black metal pots.

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:48.768
The Nine Cauldrons.
[gasps]

01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:50.739
- [phone beeps]
- [groans] Lost the signal.

01:11:50.938 --> 01:11:55.043
The Nine Cauldrons.
The mountain is opening.

01:11:56.009 --> 01:11:57.879
- [groans]
- [growls]

01:11:58.812 --> 01:12:03.149
And now all that treasure
shall be mine.

01:12:03.151 --> 01:12:05.650
- [laughs]
- No, it won't.

01:12:05.652 --> 01:12:08.423
I made a promise to Chen that
that would never happen.

01:12:08.655 --> 01:12:12.693
I gave my word!
[growls]

01:12:13.928 --> 01:12:16.662
Chaos, Mayhem, attack!

01:12:16.664 --> 01:12:17.599
[snarling]

01:12:26.139 --> 01:12:28.444
[screams]
No!

01:12:32.045 --> 01:12:33.214
[chittering]

01:12:36.017 --> 01:12:37.052
[farting]

01:12:43.825 --> 01:12:44.726
[screaming]

01:12:47.262 --> 01:12:50.566
[pants]
Oh, no. This isn't fair!

01:12:50.764 --> 01:12:53.201
I have buyers lined up
for these treasures.

01:12:54.168 --> 01:12:55.838
I gave them my word.

01:12:56.838 --> 01:12:59.174
You respect that, right?

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.239
My grandfather told me

01:13:01.241 --> 01:13:03.042
you're only as good
as your word.

01:13:03.044 --> 01:13:04.676
But I guess that also means

01:13:04.678 --> 01:13:07.114
your word is only
as good as you are.

01:13:07.615 --> 01:13:10.085
And you, Dexter,
are not very good.

01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:12.654
[laughing]

01:13:12.954 --> 01:13:15.887
Can't fool the mountain,
it was built by emperors.

01:13:15.889 --> 01:13:17.857
And it looks like
your ancient emperors

01:13:17.859 --> 01:13:19.127
are keeping their word.

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:50.686
My grandfather
will be very pleased.

01:14:51.052 --> 01:14:53.653
My grandfather won't be.
Not if I don't get back

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:55.257
to the North in time
for his wedding.

01:14:55.722 --> 01:14:56.824
I gave my word.

01:15:03.998 --> 01:15:07.602
Oh, where is Norm?
The wedding needs to start soon.

01:15:08.069 --> 01:15:12.106
Not to worry,
I'm almost finished.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:15.142
Okay, everyone?

01:15:16.276 --> 01:15:17.443
Take your places.

01:15:17.445 --> 01:15:19.815
Chop chop,
our guests are arriving.

01:15:22.917 --> 01:15:25.917
Come on, this is
a happy occasion, a wedding.

01:15:25.919 --> 01:15:27.952
- [grumbling]
- Why is everyone so down?

01:15:27.954 --> 01:15:30.155
[Olympia] Maybe it has something
to do with you, Quinn.

01:15:30.157 --> 01:15:32.091
- And your bossiness.
- Hey.

01:15:32.093 --> 01:15:34.126
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

01:15:34.128 --> 01:15:38.200
And swollen is the head
that let's power go to it, hmm?

01:15:40.901 --> 01:15:41.969
[laughing]

01:15:51.478 --> 01:15:53.080
[Stan singing]

01:15:53.847 --> 01:15:55.249
[phone ringing]

01:15:56.249 --> 01:15:57.315
[Norm] Yello.

01:15:57.317 --> 01:15:58.719
[Olympia] <i>Norm, where are you?</i>

01:15:58.953 --> 01:16:01.052
- Flying home.
- [Olympia] <i>You are?</i>

01:16:01.054 --> 01:16:03.088
Well, I'm in Fong's chopper.

01:16:03.090 --> 01:16:06.227
Great, because the Aurora
Borealis will be starting soon,

01:16:06.761 --> 01:16:09.330
and I can't stand
any more of Quinn's bossiness,

01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:11.866
or any more
of Stan's singing.

01:16:12.266 --> 01:16:14.369
[Stan singing]

01:16:16.303 --> 01:16:17.405
[speaker screeches]

01:16:22.176 --> 01:16:23.178
Of course.

01:16:35.222 --> 01:16:36.889
[grunts] I think
this helicopter took

01:16:36.891 --> 01:16:38.390
a lot more damage than we think.

01:16:38.392 --> 01:16:40.429
Look out.
Geese. Goose.

01:16:41.329 --> 01:16:42.330
Whoa!

01:16:44.531 --> 01:16:46.034
[geese honking]

01:16:46.467 --> 01:16:48.770
Well, well, the nerve.

01:16:49.035 --> 01:16:51.405
Geese have the right-of-way,
thank you.

01:16:54.542 --> 01:16:56.341
So much
for the windshield wipers.

01:16:56.343 --> 01:16:57.877
Can't see a thing.

01:16:57.879 --> 01:16:59.214
Lemmings, need your help.

01:17:07.989 --> 01:17:10.122
Oh, look how much cleaner it is.

01:17:10.124 --> 01:17:12.094
It's not clean, it's gone.

01:17:12.426 --> 01:17:15.097
Still, you got to admit
that it's a lot easier to see.

01:17:15.396 --> 01:17:17.232
Those clouds, that mountain...

01:17:18.098 --> 01:17:19.133
- Mountain?
- [beeping]

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:27.409
[whimpers]

01:17:36.918 --> 01:17:38.219
Here we go.
Good as new, eh?

01:17:41.021 --> 01:17:42.822
You're gonna have
to step on the gas.

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.055
How fast are we going?

01:17:44.057 --> 01:17:46.460
Speedometer is broken,

01:17:54.235 --> 01:17:56.601

- Okay,

01:17:56.603 --> 01:17:58.839

the helicopter can take it.

- [Olympia] <i>Yes, I'm fine.</i>

01:18:10.116 --> 01:18:11.520
Uh, not you, Chen.

01:18:11.953 --> 01:18:13.989

Vision's a little blurry,
but I'm not sure

01:18:16.523 --> 01:18:19.257

- Fear not. I'll take over.

<i>That's what I'm saying.</i>

01:18:34.174 --> 01:18:35.177
Okay.

01:18:36.043 --> 01:18:37.846
Just need to really
put on the gas.

01:19:31.665 --> 01:19:34.366
With pleasure, Your Heinie-ness.

01:19:34.368 --> 01:19:36.335
Boy, will I be glad
when dad's back

01:19:36.337 --> 01:19:39.371
and Quinn's demoted back down
to dumb older brother.

01:19:39.373 --> 01:19:40.909
- [laughs]
- [Quinn] I heard that!

01:19:47.013 --> 01:19:48.247
What's wrong?

01:19:48.249 --> 01:19:49.551
I think we're running
out of gas.

01:19:52.119 --> 01:19:53.487
[Norm] Come on. Come on!

01:19:59.026 --> 01:20:01.393
[Vera]
So, what's the backup plan

01:20:01.395 --> 01:20:03.531
if Norm doesn't show up in time?

01:20:04.632 --> 01:20:07.332
There is no backup plan.

01:20:07.334 --> 01:20:10.437
Norm gave his word,
he will be here...

01:20:12.239 --> 01:20:13.308
I hope.

01:20:14.741 --> 01:20:17.009
Oh, I suppose
I could edit the video

01:20:17.011 --> 01:20:18.609
to make it look like
he was here.

01:20:18.611 --> 01:20:22.480
Mom, forget the video,
an Aurora Borealis

01:20:22.482 --> 01:20:24.483
can last as little
as 10 minutes.

01:20:24.485 --> 01:20:26.351
