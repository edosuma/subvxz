02:41.862 --> 02:43.061
You won a lotta money.

02:43.063 --> 02:44.997
I didn't win any money.

02:44.999 --> 02:45.764
You said the spear

02:45.766 --> 02:46.565
fisherman guy bet

02:46.567 --> 02:47.699
all the tuna.

02:47.701 --> 02:48.567
He did.

02:48.569 --> 02:49.835
I thought he meant money,

02:49.837 --> 02:50.469
but he was betting

02:50.471 --> 02:52.771
actual fish.

02:52.773 --> 02:53.872
Tuna fish?

02:53.874 --> 02:55.140

02:55.142 --> 02:58.143

02:58.145 --> 02:59.411
Y' know, I got

02:59.413 --> 03:00.946
the perfect sauce

03:00.948 --> 03:04.149
for tuna fish.

03:04.151 --> 03:05.651
They aren't ready for sauce

03:05.653 --> 03:06.451
they're alive,

03:06.453 --> 03:07.186
swimming in a tank

03:07.188 --> 03:08.687
down at the Fisherman's wharf.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.922
So just sell 'em

03:09.924 --> 03:11.924
to some tuna fish company.

03:11.926 --> 03:13.492
You don't get it.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.128
I don't want it.

03:16.130 --> 03:17.029
They aren't normal

03:17.031 --> 03:17.896

03:17.898 --> 03:18.897
They're Kansas

03:18.899 --> 03:20.199

03:20.201 --> 03:20.866
So what?

03:20.868 --> 03:21.567
People can't eat Kansas

03:21.569 --> 03:22.467
razor-back tuna?

03:22.469 --> 03:24.236
No, they taste terrible

03:24.238 --> 03:25.604
and they eat everything,

03:25.606 --> 03:27.706
even people.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.407
Why would a tuna fish

03:28.409 --> 03:30.008

03:30.010 --> 03:33.378

04:40.180 --> 04:41.513
Not really.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.547
That is my friend

04:42.549 --> 04:43.749

04:43.751 --> 04:44.449

04:44.451 --> 04:46.151
scariest girl I know.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.252
Well, who's the scariest?

04:47.254 --> 04:48.820
Sam.

04:48.822 --> 04:49.888
Oh, well have Sam and jade

04:49.890 --> 04:50.589
ever met before?

04:50.591 --> 04:53.125
Hush up.

04:53.127 --> 04:53.792
Jade and Sam

04:53.794 --> 04:55.127
can never meet.

04:55.129 --> 04:56.862
They'd kill each other.

04:56.864 --> 04:57.195
