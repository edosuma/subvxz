Hurry up, girls!
It's one for the price of two!

00:50.200 --> 00:53.800
Keep taking their money, Rodney.
I'm off to the pub for a lemonade.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.400
Get us some pork scratchings.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.800
Pork scratchings?
It sounds like a pig with fleas!

01:00.840 --> 01:06.880
Here today, gone tomorrow?
No, it's here today, gone this afternoon!

01:11.240 --> 01:13.920
-All right, Trig?
-Del! How's your luck?

01:14.040 --> 01:15.240
You can have it for a nicker.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.680
Joyce, a pint of diesel oil for Trigger

01:17.760 --> 01:21.000
and I'll have a blackcurrant and Pernod.

01:21.320 --> 01:22.720
Thank you.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.680
-Guess who I just saw.
-King Feisal of Saudi Arabia.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.320
No, you're miles off, Del.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.240
No, I knew he wouldn't be in here.
He'd be in the saloon bar, wouldn't he?

01:35.520 --> 01:38.840
-I'm joking, Trig!
-Oh, gotcha!

01:40.040 --> 01:42.760
-It was your ex fiance.
-Which one?

01:42.840 --> 01:44.000
Pauline.

01:44.560 --> 01:48.120
Pauline? Pauline Harris?

01:48.200 --> 01:50.400
No, no, you must have been mistaken.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.080
She got married to Bobby Finch
and went to live abroad.

01:54.160 --> 01:57.240
Yeah? Who's that sitting over there, then?

01:58.720 --> 02:00.040
DEL CLEARS THROAT

02:04.520 --> 02:07.560
My god, that is her, Trig!

02:07.640 --> 02:12.080
It's at moments like this when I wish
I carried an emergency capsule of Brut
around with me.

02:12.160 --> 02:16.600
Leave it out, will you? You don't want to
get involved with her again.
Remember what happened last time?

02:16.720 --> 02:17.880
Yeah, yeah.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.120
Did she ask about me?

02:19.200 --> 02:23.000
Yeah. She wanted to know
how much you was earning.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.920
How the hell do you do that?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.200
Oh! I thought it was... What?

02:28.360 --> 02:32.680
I said, she seemed concerned
about how much you was earning.

02:32.760 --> 02:37.000
She probably is concerned.
Perhaps she's worrying about me.

02:37.560 --> 02:41.160
All right. I'm not gonna get involved.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.200
I'm too shrewd for that.

02:43.480 --> 02:44.600
Eh?

02:45.080 --> 02:47.640
No, I might just go and say hello,

02:47.720 --> 02:49.880
If that is all right with you two!

02:49.960 --> 02:52.120
You want your brains testing!

02:52.200 --> 02:55.560
Yeah, thank you.
Did you take one for yourself?

02:55.640 --> 02:57.000
-No.
-Good!

03:01.560 --> 03:03.720
Excuse me. Excuse me, squire.

03:22.360 --> 03:23.640
Hello, Pauline!

03:25.560 --> 03:26.760
Del!

03:31.720 --> 03:36.040
Oh, I can't believe it.
It's so nice to see you again!

03:36.120 --> 03:38.120
It's nice to see you, Pauline.

03:38.360 --> 03:40.840
What have you got on your lips?
What's all that?

03:42.400 --> 03:44.960
It's blackcurrant! It's on your lips.

03:45.040 --> 03:49.400
Blackcurrant! Oh, it's probably from
my blackcurrant and Pernod. Sorry.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.640
Oh, thanks! Ta.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.040
Let me wipe that off with, er...

04:01.680 --> 04:05.680
-Sorry.
-I haven't seen you for 12 years!

04:05.760 --> 04:08.120
I want to know all that's been happening.

04:08.640 --> 04:14.280
Oh, nothing. Nothing really.
I heard you married that Bobby Finch.
Where is he now?

04:14.560 --> 04:17.400
-He's down the Blackshaw Road.
-In the council flats?

04:17.520 --> 04:20.680
-No. In the cemetery.
-Oh!

04:20.760 --> 04:22.080
You mean you didn't know?

04:22.160 --> 04:25.720
No, I'm terribly sorry.

04:26.280 --> 04:31.640
I'd heard you'd gone abroad
so I thought you'd both emigrated.

04:31.840 --> 04:37.920
No, after Bobby died,
I went to San Francisco to get away.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.040
I got a job as an air-hostess,
good salary, uniform, free travel.

04:42.120 --> 04:46.000
It was in your blood.
Your mum was a bus conductress.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.800
You never married yourself, Del?

04:51.880 --> 04:54.520
No, I never fancied meself!

04:56.600 --> 04:58.160
No, no.

05:01.280 --> 05:04.040
No, what I mean is

05:04.120 --> 05:08.440
I never met a girl
I cared that much about.

05:09.800 --> 05:12.320
Well, there was one.

05:12.400 --> 05:15.560
-But you don't see her?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:15.640 --> 05:17.640
I'm looking at her now.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.080
Where's my pork scratchings?

05:27.520 --> 05:30.280
Sorry, Rodney, I got distracted.

05:30.360 --> 05:35.640
You remember Rodney?
He used to be a little scruff.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.400
Look at him now!

05:37.840 --> 05:40.480
He's a BIG scruff, ain't he?

05:40.560 --> 05:41.880
Do you remember Pauline?

05:41.960 --> 05:44.360
Yeah. Pauline Harris.

05:44.440 --> 05:46.920
Yeah. Or is it Mrs Finch?

05:47.000 --> 05:53.040
-No, it's Mrs Baker. I remarried, you see.
An American chap.
-DEL: Oh! I see.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.320
Divorcee, are you? No, a widow.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.120
He kicked the bucket an' all?

05:59.200 --> 06:04.000
Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean that. Sorry.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.600
She's had two husbands die on her.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.440
One more, she keeps the match ball.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.240
MOUTHS
Rodney!

06:13.160 --> 06:15.080
-Excuse me a moment.
-Yeah, of course.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.520
I'm just going to powder my nose.

06:17.600 --> 06:21.200
Hurry back, won't you,
'cause I'll be waiting.

06:23.600 --> 06:28.600
"Yes, of course, Pauline. Hurry back,
Pauline. And can I pull the chain
for you, Pauline?" You make me sick!

06:29.560 --> 06:32.560
You're very hostile towards her!

06:32.640 --> 06:35.920
Can you blame me?
I remember how she treated you
when you was engaged.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.440
I might have been a child,
but I remember how she screwed you up.

06:39.560 --> 06:44.280
That was long ago.
When Pauline and me were engaged,
we was Mods.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.600
She left me for a bloke
with a faster Vespa.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.400
And that's a fair reason?

06:50.480 --> 06:54.240
It was in them days!
You wouldn't understand.

06:54.800 --> 06:59.880
In them days, teenage marriages broke up
because the husband
didn't like the Hollies.

07:01.120 --> 07:07.920
But we're older now, you know.
We're more mature. We've developed
sensitivity and emotion.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.560
My God!

07:09.640 --> 07:12.280
What would you know about it, eh?

07:12.360 --> 07:16.200
You don't have romantic feelings.
You just have animal urges.

07:17.640 --> 07:21.240
You learned the art of seduction
by watching <i>Wildlife On One</i>

07:24.280 --> 07:27.640
You've gotta understand, Rodney, you know,

07:27.720 --> 07:32.400
that deep down inside of me,
I'm a very sensitive person.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.000
RODNEY SNIGGERS

07:34.080 --> 07:38.600
I am! I am! Look at last Christmas
in that film,<i> Love Story. </i>

07:38.680 --> 07:40.200
Look how upset I got then!

07:40.280 --> 07:41.560
I got upset an' all!

07:41.640 --> 07:44.640
I know. I got upset 'cause
Ali MacGraw died.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.640
You got upset 'cause Ryan O'Neal didn't!

07:49.840 --> 07:51.680
He's too good-looking, ain't he?

07:51.760 --> 07:54.000
What do you know about it, anyway?

07:54.120 --> 07:57.040
What do you know?
I am talking about men and women.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.800
You're still knocking around
with brownies!

07:58.880 --> 08:00.240
No, I'm not!

08:00.320 --> 08:03.800
You do! They arrive by skateboard!

08:04.680 --> 08:10.280
All I'm trying to say is don't get
hiked up with that Pauline again.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.560
She'll screw you up. Mark my words!

08:13.160 --> 08:14.400
CLEARS THROAT

08:14.480 --> 08:16.400
Look, Rodney,

08:16.480 --> 08:21.040
a lot of water has run under the bridge
since me and Pauline broke up.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.920
I know what it's all about now.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.600
I understand the rules of the game.

08:29.760 --> 08:35.240
I know you're concerned for me,
and I know you're trying to give me
your advice,

08:35.320 --> 08:38.120
but...how can I put it?

08:39.520 --> 08:43.080
Shove it, Rodney! Shove it!

08:44.600 --> 08:49.320
MAN ON TV:
<i>It began in the womb of Anglicanism</i>

08:50.280 --> 08:54.520
<i>but the followers of John Wesley came </i>
<i>to regard their own authority as soft.</i>

08:54.800 --> 08:56.960
Del Boy's late, ain't he?

08:57.040 --> 09:02.000
I wouldn't worry about it.
We'll give him another 15 minutes
then phone the morgues.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.040
The morgues?

09:04.120 --> 09:08.200
That Pauline kills them all off.
She must be a carrier.

09:09.440 --> 09:12.760
It's bad news him meeting her again today.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.440
I remember the last time.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.680
I mean, up till then
we was doing all right.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.840
Well, your mum'd died and your dad
had run off and left you...

09:21.920 --> 09:24.880
-Otherwise, tickety-boo?
-Right.

09:25.520 --> 09:31.160
Del was out wheelin' and dealin'
and we was coming along nice.
Then she turned up.

09:32.040 --> 09:37.920
I've never seen anyone change
so fast as Del. He was besotted.

09:39.240 --> 09:43.720
They was engaged within the week.
Broke up within the month.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.560
Little cow was out sky-larking
with other fellas.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.240
Del had more fights than John Wayne.

09:51.720 --> 09:57.120
Well, up till then he was always
a strong believer in God and all that.

09:57.800 --> 10:01.040
He didn't go to church.

10:01.120 --> 10:04.280
Didn't carry it to ridiculous lengths.

10:04.560 --> 10:09.240
No, but he always gave the church
a few quid towards a new roof.

10:09.960 --> 10:14.080
He said it was a penance
as he'd nicked the old one.

10:15.960 --> 10:19.840
But after that, he lost faith.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.000
DOOR SLAMS

10:21.080 --> 10:24.840

10:47.440 --> 10:50.760
Gentlemen, attention, gentlemen.

10:50.840 --> 10:54.440
Gentlemen and Grandad,
I have an announcement to make.

10:55.440 --> 10:58.480
Pauline and I are engaged
to be married!

11:01.040 --> 11:04.480
Don't all burst a blood-vessel,
will you, eh?

11:04.560 --> 11:08.880
We'll put an announcement
in the<i> Exchange and Mart.</i>

11:09.480 --> 11:15.560
That's a great idea, Rod!
Go and get some glasses, go on!
We'll celebrate.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.160
We'll celebrate. Yeah!

11:17.240 --> 11:21.600
I'm not gonna celebrate my brother
getting hiked up to a gold-digger!

11:21.680 --> 11:25.840
Listen, motor-mouth,
I know you don't like Pauline...

11:25.960 --> 11:28.800
-Does it show?
-Yes, it does!

11:28.880 --> 11:33.080
I know you don't like the idea, right?

11:33.160 --> 11:37.080
But it's what I want.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.920
Come on, come on!

11:40.000 --> 11:42.160
Come and have a drink, eh?
Have a drink, eh?

11:42.240 --> 11:44.600
Yeah, yeah. I'll get some glasses.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.880
Yeah, get some glasses!

11:47.440 --> 11:49.600
Here, Grandad, what d'you think?

11:49.680 --> 11:51.760
I'm saying nothing!

11:51.840 --> 11:57.760
If you want to put yourself in lumber
for the rest of your life, it's up to you.

11:58.360 --> 12:02.080
But you haven't heard the best part yet.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.280
This is a double celebration.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.480
Not only have I got engaged to Pauline,

12:07.560 --> 12:13.600
but my bride-to-be has condescended
to come and live with us.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.320
Don't say, "Congratulations!" then!

12:18.400 --> 12:19.720
RODNEY: All right!

12:20.400 --> 12:21.640
SLAMS DOOR

12:29.640 --> 12:31.760
Say something, then, Grandad!

12:31.840 --> 12:34.480
There's a film on the other side.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.960
Lots of people get killed in it.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.080
I cleaned that table today.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.960
Good, it won't dirty me plimsolls, then.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.600
-Del!
-What?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.400
Rodney!

13:06.720 --> 13:13.440
Well, that was divine, my love.
Pas de Calais, as the French say.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.440
Long time since we had steak, eh?

13:16.520 --> 13:19.760
Yes. Me and Grandad had corned beef.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.440
Corned beef?

13:22.320 --> 13:24.960
I'm not cooking for them two
as well, Derek.

13:25.040 --> 13:29.360
Just you and me.
I didn't come here to be a skivvy.

13:29.440 --> 13:35.120
I know, my petal, but when I gave
you the housekeeping money,

13:35.200 --> 13:37.000
I meant you to get grub in for them, too.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.440
I did. I got corned beef.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.640
Ah.

13:40.720 --> 13:45.720
Well, you like a bit of corned beef,
don't you, Grandad?

13:49.240 --> 13:51.960
-What's up with you, then?
-It's her, innit?

13:52.040 --> 13:55.400
-What?
-She's hidden my teeth!

13:59.000 --> 14:00.200
Now...

14:00.680 --> 14:03.120
What've you hidden his teeth for?

14:03.200 --> 14:05.880
You don't know what it's like here.

14:05.960 --> 14:10.160
You and Rodney are at the auctions
but I'm stuck here with him.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.880
He nibbles all day long.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.040
There'd be nothing left
if I left him to it.

14:16.120 --> 14:20.040
Don't worry. He gets his teeth back
at mealtimes.

14:21.160 --> 14:24.720
Well, you know best, eh, petal?

14:30.000 --> 14:35.000
Why don't you and Grandad go out, Rodney?
I could be alone for once.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.000
-You wanna be left alone?
-Of course!

14:37.080 --> 14:41.840
-Then I'll go, too.
-Alone with you!

14:42.040 --> 14:44.920
We never have time to ourselves.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.120
What? You spend half your lives
in that bedroom.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.760
Giant pandas mate quicker than you!

14:52.560 --> 14:54.640
Rodney, enough!

14:54.720 --> 14:59.760
All we seem to do of an evening is
sit here watching them televisions.

15:00.440 --> 15:02.240
And another thing.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.120
Why does he watch two televisions?

15:04.200 --> 15:06.840
'Cause the other one's broken.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.840
He normally has three?

15:08.920 --> 15:11.960
-Yeah.
-He's going senile.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.080
Yeah.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.600
Wouldn't he be happier
with company of his own age?

15:17.680 --> 15:20.560
You're not bringing
your granny round, are you?

15:20.640 --> 15:22.080
I was thinking of a home.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.800
He's already got a home!

15:23.880 --> 15:28.720
I know a nice place.
Bobby's dad died there.

15:29.920 --> 15:34.400
I can't put him in a home, Pauline!
He's family!

15:34.480 --> 15:36.440
I'll be family soon.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.440
You go in a home, then!

15:38.800 --> 15:42.000
I don't wanna go in no home!

15:42.080 --> 15:44.640
Don't worry. We're staying put.

15:44.720 --> 15:48.360
Well, we'll have to buy a house
of our own, then.

15:48.440 --> 15:51.760
Me buy a house? I couldn't.

15:51.840 --> 15:56.840
As soon as I put my signature
on a document,
the authorities will know I'm alive.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.560
They'll be round after their pound
of flesh quicker than the Mafia!

16:02.480 --> 16:05.920
You could do what my other husbands did,
put the house in my name.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.480
Nobody will think it's strange.

16:08.680 --> 16:12.000
I've got the money
from the life insurances.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.800
Have you got your life insured, Del?

16:13.880 --> 16:17.240
No. Never thought about dying before!

16:18.680 --> 16:22.240
Well, we'll have to sort that out.
A wife does need protection.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.600
Especially with your luck, Pauline.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.760
I fancy an early night, Del.

16:28.840 --> 16:30.640
What, again?

16:32.720 --> 16:36.720
-Come on!
-Yes, all right, my love, petal!

16:39.120 --> 16:40.800
Listen, you two...
EXCLAIMS IN PAIN

16:49.000 --> 16:50.640
You ready, Grandad?

16:50.720 --> 16:53.360
I just wanna see what happens first.

16:54.080 --> 16:59.920
We both agreed we're not wanted here,
so let's go before Del's up.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.080
We can't go without saying goodbye.

17:03.160 --> 17:05.560
OK, we'll say goodbye.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.600
Is Del up yet? No. He needs his sleep.
He had a bad night.

17:11.680 --> 17:14.320
It didn't sound too bad
from where I was.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.440
-I'll wake him up.
-I'll wake him.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.520
I don't want you in that room.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.760
But that's my mum's room!

17:22.840 --> 17:27.840
It used to be. It''s mine now
and I don't want you in there.
Understood?

17:27.920 --> 17:31.600
<i>-Jawohl, mein Obergruppenführer!</i>
-Act your age!

17:32.920 --> 17:35.720
Why don't you bike it, you old bag?

17:37.760 --> 17:42.760
The bedroom's probably filled with
her devices of sexual torture.

17:43.800 --> 17:49.480
Del's bound and gagged and bound,
and being threatened with French lessons!

17:50.760 --> 17:54.080
Maybe that's why he's been looking
a bit seedy.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.480
Yeah. It's hardly through lack of food.

17:57.560 --> 18:02.080
Third World nations would give up their
mineral rights for that!

18:02.160 --> 18:04.120
Wonder what happened to his fried slice.

18:04.200 --> 18:08.080
Perhaps he didn't want.
His stomach's been dickie.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.640
That's true.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.800
PHONE RINGS

18:13.120 --> 18:16.640
Hello? Hello, Trig. I'll get him.

18:17.120 --> 18:20.600
Pauline, untie Del, will you?
He's wanted!

18:22.080 --> 18:25.800
I'm up! What do you mean,
"Untie, Del", anyway?

18:25.920 --> 18:27.240
RODNEY: Nothing.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.800
-Who is it?
-It's Trig.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.080
Trigger.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.040
Hello, Trig. What do you want?
No, no, you didn't disturb me.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.200
I had to get up,
I was wanted on the phone.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.680
-Del...
-Hang on, Trig.

18:37.760 --> 18:38.960
Cut it out!

18:39.280 --> 18:43.040
I'm just going to put a deposit
on that ring.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.400
Another one?

18:44.480 --> 18:48.320
You must have more rings than Bravingtons!

18:48.400 --> 18:50.040
Shut it, Rodney!

18:50.120 --> 18:54.880
What is it with you? Are you trying
to corner the world's gold market?

18:54.960 --> 18:57.680
I'll bang you one in a minute!

18:57.760 --> 19:00.840
Don't forget the insurance medical.

19:00.920 --> 19:04.480
I'll see you down the estate agents
then we can go on to the bank.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.040
DEL: OK, darling.

19:08.680 --> 19:14.120
<i>-Sieg Heil! </i>
-Cut it out! Been sniffing that glue
again, have you?

19:15.720 --> 19:20.280
Sorry about that, Trigger.
It's just Rodney having one of his fits.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.760
Anyway, what did you want
to phone me about?

19:23.840 --> 19:27.560
What's a delicate matter? Eh?

19:28.120 --> 19:32.160
No, I know you're me mate...
No, I won't say you're interfering.

19:33.320 --> 19:37.280
I promise I won't tell you
to mind your own business!
Just spit it out.

19:38.360 --> 19:41.800
Yeah... Did I?

19:43.480 --> 19:44.640
Did you?

19:45.720 --> 19:46.880
Did he?

19:47.720 --> 19:54.000
Well, listen, Trig, why don't you
mind your own bloody business, eh?
Why are you interfering?

19:54.080 --> 19:57.600
You just keep your nose out of it!
All right, pal?

19:59.400 --> 20:02.400
How's Trig keeping?

20:02.800 --> 20:09.440
He had the audacity to say that
he'd heard the police had
investigated Bobby Finch's death.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.960
Apparently he died of food poisoning.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.880
Food poisoning! Oh!

20:16.440 --> 20:20.320
Your breakfast's getting cold, Del Boy.

20:22.080 --> 20:25.840
Yeah.
Yeah, thanks, Grandad.

20:26.440 --> 20:31.720
You know, I think I'm putting on weight.
Think I'll go on a diet.

20:31.800 --> 20:35.360
There's no calories in weed-killer!

20:38.200 --> 20:40.880
You make me die, you do!

20:42.240 --> 20:46.200
I suppose Pauline's gone window shopping
at Rent-a-Kills?

20:46.880 --> 20:49.800
I'm going to make arrangements
for my medical. I'll see you two later.

20:49.880 --> 20:54.880
No, you won't, Del.
Me and Grandad are getting out.

20:54.960 --> 21:01.360
Eh? You mean leaving?
Leave it out, Rodney!
What'll you do for money?

21:01.440 --> 21:04.000
We'll get by.
We're thinking of forming a partnership.

21:04.080 --> 21:07.520
Partnership between you two!

21:07.600 --> 21:11.320
Cor, leave it out, Rodney! Are you daft?

21:11.920 --> 21:16.360
You must have noticed some time
or another that he doesn't move!

21:16.440 --> 21:22.680
He made the front page of
<i>The Lancet</i> as the only living man
to be treated for rigor mortis!

21:24.240 --> 21:25.680
Where are you going?

21:25.760 --> 21:27.840
Auntie Rose's in Clacton.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.240
Clacton?

21:30.320 --> 21:32.080
Grandad says we'll be wanted there.

21:32.160 --> 21:38.480
Oh, did he? Well, you'd better go
there now, then, the pair of you,

21:39.120 --> 21:43.840
before Pauline comes back
with me deadly nightshade!

21:46.520 --> 21:47.920
Rodney!

21:50.200 --> 21:54.320
You don't believe all that rubbish
about food poisoning?

21:54.400 --> 21:57.840
'Course not. Eat your mushrooms, Del.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.000
-Rodney!
-We're not coming back.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.800
No, hang about, I'm coming with you!

22:15.720 --> 22:20.000
Come on! Bring in the suitcases!

22:21.280 --> 22:25.360
Ha-ha! Surprise! Hello, Auntie!

22:25.440 --> 22:28.600
Bet you're surprised to see us, eh?
Come on, you two!

22:30.840 --> 22:34.240
Oh, yes! Very nice!

22:35.920 --> 22:42.320
Here we are!
Here, Grandad, change the channels.
There's racing on half past two.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.840
What did you put in Pauline's note?

22:49.920 --> 22:56.680
I put, "My dearest, darling Pauline.
The engagement's off,
the wedding's off and I'm off.

22:56.760 --> 23:03.520
"You've got five days to get out
of the flat, and don't come back,
you money-grabbing murderess.

23:03.960 --> 23:10.600
"All my love, Del Boy."
And a few kisses.
That was the gist of it.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.920
She'll most probably
smash that flat to pieces!

23:15.000 --> 23:16.360
Have you had enough?

23:16.440 --> 23:18.920
Mmm! That was handsome.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.440
Well, it was Champs Elysees
as the French say.

23:22.520 --> 23:23.960
Listen, darling.

23:24.040 --> 23:30.760
We're going to be here for about five days
so I want you to take this money.

23:30.840 --> 23:33.720
I don't want you out of pocket.

23:33.800 --> 23:36.960
Well, that's very nice of you.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.080
Do you mind if I ask you something?

23:39.160 --> 23:43.560
Of course not!<i> Maniére d'êtr</i><i>e!</i>

23:44.480 --> 23:46.000
Who are you?

23:50.240 --> 23:52.000
Who are we?

23:52.840 --> 23:58.640
We've ate all your pie, had a bath
each and you don't know who we are?

23:59.280 --> 24:03.000
Well, I didn't like to ask,
because you seemed to know me.

24:05.080 --> 24:08.000
Well, we're Joanie's boys, aren't we?

24:08.080 --> 24:13.880
Well, he isn't! You remember,
she married Reg Trotter.

24:14.400 --> 24:15.520
You were at the wedding.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.240
I don't remember you.

24:17.320 --> 24:21.120
'Course not! Not at me mum's wedding!

24:21.960 --> 24:24.560
I was only a babe in arms.

24:24.640 --> 24:28.320
-You said come down any time.
-When was this, then?

24:28.400 --> 24:33.560
-1947.
-So here we are!

24:34.280 --> 24:36.600
You must remember the wedding!

24:36.680 --> 24:39.320
It was at that big church,

24:39.400 --> 24:43.640
Our Lady of the Divine Rosemary, Peckham.

24:43.720 --> 24:47.720
Peckham? I've never been to Peckham
in me life!

24:48.320 --> 24:53.640
Mind you, the lady what owned
the cottage before me,
she came from Peckham.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.120
-Auntie Rose has moved.
-Who's this, then?

24:58.200 --> 24:59.920
God knows!

25:00.280 --> 25:05.600
Joanie... Joanie Hollins?
Married a Jamaican fella?

25:06.760 --> 25:08.640
-Er, yeah.
-Yeah!

25:08.720 --> 25:11.840
-But you don't look very...
-We're adopted.

25:11.960 --> 25:14.280
Ohh!

25:14.480 --> 25:16.800
Some apple pie?

25:16.880 --> 25:20.080
Smashing, Auntie! Thank you!

25:26.280 --> 25:29.560
WHISPERS
Shh! Come on! Come in here!

25:29.640 --> 25:32.640
Shh! Be alert!

25:33.280 --> 25:39.360
Pauline could come rushing out
of any of these rooms, brandishing
her pearl-handled flick-knife.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.920
It'll be like <i>Psycho</i> in a tower block!

25:44.120 --> 25:49.960
Listen, I'll take the living-room,
Rodney, the bedroom, Grandad,
the kitchen.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.000
And good luck!

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
Go on, son! Go on!
Go on, Grandad!

26:12.640 --> 26:14.720
She's not in the bedrooms!

26:14.800 --> 26:18.560
-She done any damage?
-No. All the beds are neatly made.

26:18.640 --> 26:22.040
The kitchen's really clean and tidy!

26:23.000 --> 26:25.840
What's her game, then?

26:25.920 --> 26:30.160
There's no way Pauline would leave
without doing something nasty.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.680
Hey!

26:33.400 --> 26:37.040
No, that'd be daft.
Where would she get a bomb from?

26:37.920 --> 26:43.360
Here's a letter. It's for "that
no-good, lying, two-faced creepo."

26:43.440 --> 26:45.440
That'll be for me.

26:48.080 --> 26:52.240
Let's see what she's got
to say for herself.

26:52.320 --> 26:57.280
Here we are... That's more like
the Pauline I know and love!

26:57.800 --> 27:02.160
Oh, dear, look at the language!

27:02.240 --> 27:06.520
You'd think an ex air-hostess would
be able to spell better than that!

27:06.600 --> 27:09.600
-Is that true?
-What? No!

27:11.640 --> 27:14.440
Del, did Pauline really mean
that much to you?

27:14.520 --> 27:18.560
Hmm? No, no. Not really.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.960
No, somehow it wasn't
quite the same.

27:24.800 --> 27:29.400
I think I'm not really cut out
for this falling in love lark.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.480
I've got a confession to make, Del.

27:39.560 --> 27:43.920
You know that phone call from Trig
about the food poisoning?

27:45.320 --> 27:49.400
Well, it was a wind-up.
Me and Grandad put him up to it.
We did it for you, Del.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.720
You put him up to it?

27:56.800 --> 28:00.000
It was nothing to do with me, Del.
I only suggested it.

28:01.600 --> 28:06.040
That's right.
We was only thinking of you, Del!

28:06.120 --> 28:11.600
You was only thinking of me,
you couple of rascals!

28:14.680 --> 28:18.320
What am I gonna do with you two?

28:18.400 --> 28:20.320
It got you out of shtuck.

28:20.400 --> 28:24.000
We're OK on our own.
We don't need no birds.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.320
If you say so, Grandad!

28:26.400 --> 28:30.040
Go on, put the kettle on, eh?

28:31.120 --> 28:33.840
Look at the way she spells that "pto"!

28:33.920 --> 28:36.560
It's P.T.O. Please Turn Over.

28:36.640 --> 28:41.080
I know what Please Turn Over means!

28:41.160 --> 28:43.760
I'm not illiterate and all that.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.600
Here, there's someone on the phone.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.440
-It's Tim!
-Tim who?

28:47.520 --> 28:50.120
Tim the Talking Clock.

28:52.480 --> 28:57.320
Oh, the cow! She only phoned
the Talking Clock before she left!

28:57.400 --> 29:01.360
And this is Gordon Bennett!
This is dated four days ago.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.720
This Tim's got a funny accent.

29:09.440 --> 29:12.440
She only phoned a talking clock
in America!

29:12.520 --> 29:15.040
You mean we're connected to America?

29:16.080 --> 29:19.000
It's amazing, innit?

29:19.080 --> 29:20.360
