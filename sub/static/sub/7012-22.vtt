00:07.020 --> 00:10.700
Hey, guess who's dropping Jackie off here
after cheerleading practice?

00:10.740 --> 00:13.860
Leslie Cannon.

00:13.940 --> 00:17.860
Ah, Leslie Cannon.
Nickname: The Cannon.

00:17.900 --> 00:20.060
Why? Because she always
shoots Eric down.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.980
Man, you were so
in love with her.

00:23.020 --> 00:25.660
Remember in the seventh grade
when she asked you your name...

00:25.740 --> 00:30.260
and you got all panicky
and said, "Uh-bluh"?

00:30.340 --> 00:34.540
Yeah, and then she called you
"Uh-bluh" for, like, the next two years.

00:34.580 --> 00:36.740
That was awesome.

00:36.820 --> 00:39.660
I still don't see why
we have to spend the night.

00:39.700 --> 00:43.340
It only took me 30 minutes to get caught up
with everyone at my high school reunion.

00:43.420 --> 00:46.740
Oh, well, standing in the corner
muttering "dumb-ass" at everyone...

00:46.820 --> 00:49.220
doesn't count
as getting caught up.

00:50.460 --> 00:52.900
I can't wait to see
some dear, old girlfriends.

00:52.980 --> 00:56.340
Like the Miller twins.
God, I hope they're fat.

00:56.420 --> 01:01.340
Oh, crap. There's no way that all
these bags are gonna fit in here.

01:01.420 --> 01:05.780
Oh, geez, I was really looking forward
to taking this baby out on the highway.

01:05.860 --> 01:08.620
Well, we'll just have to
take two cars.

01:08.660 --> 01:11.900
No, we'll take the Toyota.

01:11.980 --> 01:14.500
I can bring another dress.
Shows a little more leg...

01:14.580 --> 01:17.020
so Stuart McDaniel
can see what he missed out on.

01:19.500 --> 01:23.780
Oh, hey, you guys.
Here comes Leslie.

01:23.860 --> 01:25.740
Hey, how's my hair?

01:25.780 --> 01:27.700
It's a little messy.

01:29.300 --> 01:31.780
Hey, it's Uh-bluh!

01:33.900 --> 01:37.620
Yeah, um,
I'm going by Eric now.

01:37.700 --> 01:42.380
She doesn't care what your name is, Eric.
She's a cheerleader.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.900
Wow, this car is so hot!

01:46.980 --> 01:49.460
Yeah, that's kind of like
what I was thinking.

01:51.900 --> 01:54.340
Really? 'Cause I was thinking
<i>she</i> was hot.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.300
Yeah.

01:56.340 --> 01:58.260
Hey, mama.

02:04.340 --> 02:07.740
So, uh,
whose car is this?

02:07.820 --> 02:12.340
Oh, uh, it's my dad's...
tough luck that it's mine.

02:14.220 --> 02:16.700
So, what kind of engine
is in this thing?

02:19.940 --> 02:23.500
Oh, well, it's, uh...
it's a multi-piston...

02:26.060 --> 02:28.580
200.

02:28.620 --> 02:33.060
That's, uh, twice as powerful
as the... the 100.

02:33.140 --> 02:36.700
You know what? I think you should
take me for a drive tonight.

02:39.940 --> 02:42.620
Are you talking to me? Yeah... No...

02:42.700 --> 02:45.620
Sure. Yeah... No... Shut up.
Yes, it's my car. Sure.

02:45.700 --> 02:48.660
- Pick me up at 7:00.
- Okay.

02:50.020 --> 02:52.380
Oh, my God.
What have I done?

02:52.460 --> 02:54.540
Well, you're using
your dad's dream car...

02:54.620 --> 02:58.660
to get with a totally hot chick
who would otherwise never date you.

02:58.700 --> 03:01.340
When you put it like that,
it just sounds right.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.074

03:36.690 --> 03:38.650
Here's the keys
to the Corvette.

03:38.730 --> 03:40.610
But...

03:40.690 --> 03:43.050
the only reason
I'm giving them to you...

03:43.130 --> 03:46.090
is so you can move it
in case there's a fire.

03:49.970 --> 03:52.130
And because you trust me.

03:52.210 --> 03:54.570
Right!

03:55.970 --> 03:58.810
Now, you know that I'll know
if the Corvette's been moved.

03:58.850 --> 04:02.170
I've noted its exact position
in the garage...

04:02.210 --> 04:04.130
the angle of the wheels...

04:04.210 --> 04:08.730
and I just might have
set a few booby traps.

04:10.650 --> 04:15.010
I am so lucky to have a daddy
who cares enough to set booby traps.

04:15.090 --> 04:18.250
Fine. Okay, I get it. The only way I get
to drive the Corvette is if there's a fire.

04:18.329 --> 04:21.570
But to the end of the driveway.
No further.

04:21.649 --> 04:24.370
A fire is no excuse
for a joyride.

04:43.170 --> 04:46.170
Michael, what are you doing in Casey's room?

04:46.210 --> 04:49.730
Spittin' in his socks. What are you doing?

04:49.810 --> 04:52.690
We came by
to say hi to Casey.

04:52.770 --> 04:56.050
Watching you spit
is just a super bonus.

04:56.130 --> 04:59.170
Yeah? Well, your lover's
out of town.

04:59.250 --> 05:01.370
And I asked your <i>lover</i>
where he was going...

05:01.450 --> 05:04.490
and your lover said, "Neptune,"
and that he'd be back tomorrow.

05:04.570 --> 05:08.890
And then your lover punched me
in the head and laughed.

05:08.970 --> 05:13.370
But we'll see who's laughing when he puts
on his socks and gets his feet all spitty.

05:13.450 --> 05:16.090
Ha!

05:17.610 --> 05:20.730
Casey's out of town?
He never tells me anything.

05:20.810 --> 05:25.410
It's like the only thing I know
about him is that he's Kelso's brother.

05:25.490 --> 05:28.930
Well, you know he subscribes
to <i>Van Aficionado.</i>

05:30.210 --> 05:33.730
Stop snooping, Jackie.

05:33.810 --> 05:39.410
But, Donna, you know, say this pile of stuff
was to get accidentally knocked over.

05:39.490 --> 05:41.530
Oh, no!

05:43.010 --> 05:48.010
And while picking it up,
you just happen to look through it.

05:48.090 --> 05:51.250
Jackie, I'm not gonna snoop.

05:51.330 --> 05:54.050
Oh, look! He took a quiz.

05:54.130 --> 05:57.890
"Your Ideal Chick:
Van Fan or Biker Liker?"

06:01.050 --> 06:03.930
But you know what?
You wouldn't care what kind of girl he likes.

06:03.970 --> 06:06.010
I mean, you're only dating him.

06:10.210 --> 06:12.090
Oh, no!

06:18.210 --> 06:20.890
Forman, I can't believe you're actually
gonna take out Red's Corvette.

06:20.930 --> 06:24.610
Yeah, and I can't believe you're wearing
brown shoes with a black belt.

06:26.530 --> 06:28.410
That's just tacky.

06:30.010 --> 06:33.450
Guys, the odometer's busted.

06:33.530 --> 06:36.770
The odometer's busted!

06:36.810 --> 06:39.810
That's a sign from God.

06:39.890 --> 06:41.810
God loves me.

06:41.890 --> 06:44.130
He wants me
to steal the car.

06:46.250 --> 06:49.290
Besides, I think I've learned
most of Red's tricks now...

06:49.370 --> 06:51.690
like this one:

06:51.770 --> 06:55.290
The old "strand of hair
across the ignition" trap.

06:56.690 --> 07:00.450
Yeah, you're a regular
Green Beret, Forman.

07:00.490 --> 07:04.330
Oh, please. With that outfit,
a green beret is the last thing he needs.

07:25.450 --> 07:28.170
Well, here we are...

07:28.250 --> 07:30.090
in my Corvette...

07:31.170 --> 07:33.370
enjoying the open road and...

07:33.410 --> 07:36.330
the delightful,
pine-fresh scent of your hair.

07:36.410 --> 07:39.290
That's your cheapo
air freshener.

07:39.330 --> 07:41.890
- Yuck.
- No, no, no, no. No, no.

07:41.970 --> 07:43.810
Hello.

07:48.330 --> 07:50.490
Can I drive?

07:52.130 --> 07:54.010
Uh, I don't know.

08:01.330 --> 08:03.250
Uh-bluh.

08:06.930 --> 08:11.770
Okay, now, if the Miller twins
are fat, be nice.

08:11.810 --> 08:16.090
But if they're still thin,
I don't want to hear any "hubba-hubbas"...

08:16.130 --> 08:19.170
or remarks about
doubling your pleasure.

08:19.250 --> 08:22.530
Remember, it's my reunion.
I am the prettiest one here.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.530
Well, you are
the prettiest one here.

08:36.250 --> 08:39.610
I don't understand.
The invitation says the 29th.

08:39.690 --> 08:43.490
Kitty, that says the 23rd.

08:43.530 --> 08:46.690
I have been telling you for months
that you need glasses.

08:46.770 --> 08:49.890
You know, one of these days,
you're gonna wander off and fall into a hole.

08:51.290 --> 08:54.250
What hole?
Where are these holes?

08:54.330 --> 08:58.450
They're everywhere. You just can't
see 'em, 'cause you need glasses.

09:01.410 --> 09:04.290
Well, we spent three hours
in Casey's room...

09:04.370 --> 09:07.090
and all we found out is
that he collects mud flaps.

09:07.170 --> 09:10.690
Yeah, but all that snooping
gave me such a rush.

09:10.770 --> 09:14.170
Hey, let's go to the mall
and shoplift some lip gloss.

09:15.250 --> 09:18.090
No thanks, little felon.

09:18.170 --> 09:20.410
I feel guilty enough.

09:20.490 --> 09:22.970
Besides, I have to finish
my chemistry homework.

09:23.050 --> 09:25.330
Oh, no!

09:29.050 --> 09:33.650
I left my chemistry book on Casey's desk,
and he comes back tomorrow!

09:33.730 --> 09:36.410
So we'll just
go back and get it.

09:36.450 --> 09:40.250
Jackie, I already went over there all,
"Where's Casey?"

09:41.490 --> 09:44.970
Now if I go back all,
"Where's my book"...

09:45.050 --> 09:48.450
But you are all,
"Where's my book?"

09:48.530 --> 09:51.450
But Kelso won't believe that,
and then he'll think I'm a goob...

09:51.530 --> 09:54.050
and then he'll tell Casey
that I'm a goob!

09:54.130 --> 09:56.010
Okay.

09:56.090 --> 09:59.690
Okay, look. We'll wait till later tonight,
then sneak back in and get it.

09:59.770 --> 10:03.570
Besides, Casey's got this really
great clock radio I really want.

10:06.330 --> 10:09.810
Oh, Kitty, don't tell Eric
that we're coming home.

10:09.890 --> 10:14.490
If he's doing something wrong... and we both
know he is... it's important that I catch him.

10:14.530 --> 10:17.930
- Why?
- Because it gives me pleasure.

10:19.610 --> 10:21.850
- There's the three.
- Shut it!

10:23.050 --> 10:25.930
I'm Red, dumb-ass.

10:34.410 --> 10:36.890
Where are my muffins,
dumb-ass?

10:43.290 --> 10:47.290
Forman residence. Dr. Hook speaking.

10:47.330 --> 10:49.650
Who is it, dumb-ass?

10:51.050 --> 10:53.050
Steven, honey,
it's Mrs. Forman.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.330
- Oh, hey, Mrs. Forman.
- Mrs. Forman?

10:59.410 --> 11:02.610
Um, there's been some sort of...
sort of little mistake.

11:02.690 --> 11:05.690
I finished my homework.
Now let's move on to Bible study!

11:07.170 --> 11:09.530
It seems like my reunion
was last week.

11:09.570 --> 11:12.970
Oh, that's too bad. You were really looking
forward to seeing them fat twins, right?

11:13.050 --> 11:16.890
So, we're coming
home tonight.

11:16.930 --> 11:20.090
Tell Eric, okay?

11:20.170 --> 11:22.810
It's important.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.770
Yeah, of course.

11:24.810 --> 11:27.650
Okay. Bye, sweetie.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.890
They're coming home early.
You know what this means?

11:31.970 --> 11:34.650
- Yeah, we have to hurry up and find Eric.
- No.

11:34.690 --> 11:37.090
We have to hurry up
and finish the rest of Red's beer.

11:39.210 --> 11:41.410
Hopefully, Forman'll
get blamed for that too.

11:49.490 --> 11:53.050
Boy, this is fun,
but I think race time is over now!

11:56.810 --> 12:00.290
Good, we're slowing down.

12:00.370 --> 12:03.090
That's good.

12:03.170 --> 12:05.050
A little motion sickness
going on.

12:06.970 --> 12:12.690
But, uh, the car's all in one piece, so...
I'm on top of the world.

12:16.730 --> 12:19.570
What was that?

12:22.490 --> 12:26.770
That was me... falling off
the top of the world.

12:32.410 --> 12:37.490
Well, the good news is,
I found the hubcap in a huge field of mud.

12:37.530 --> 12:40.370
And the other good news is,
in about a hundred years...

12:40.410 --> 12:43.090
some archaeologist is gonna be thrilled
to find my shoes.

12:44.530 --> 12:47.090
Sorry.

12:47.170 --> 12:51.770
Yeah, well, you know...
Look, there aren't any scratches or dents.

12:51.850 --> 12:54.970
So, just dirt.
I-I think I'm in the clear.

12:56.410 --> 12:58.970
Eric, I'm starting to think
I might like you.

13:01.530 --> 13:04.010
- Really?
- I'm not sure though.

13:04.090 --> 13:06.050
I think I have to drive
the car some more.

13:06.130 --> 13:09.930
Oh. Well, I'm starting to think
I might let you drive the car.

13:10.010 --> 13:13.290
- Really?
- I'm not sure though.

13:13.370 --> 13:15.690
I think we might have
to make out some more.

13:29.130 --> 13:31.290
- Okay, I got it.
- Okay, let's go.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.770
Jackie?

13:37.850 --> 13:40.530
Donna?

13:40.570 --> 13:42.650
Am I dreaming?

13:44.490 --> 13:47.530
Uh, yes.

13:49.210 --> 13:53.450
- Yes, you are.
- Are we gonna do it?

13:58.050 --> 14:00.690
Yes. Yes, Michael,
we are.

14:00.730 --> 14:04.770
Cool. Donna first.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.130
So you smooched
the Cannon.

14:15.450 --> 14:17.370
How was her tongue?

14:18.370 --> 14:20.290
Was it nimble?

14:21.730 --> 14:26.530
Like a belly dancer.
And at one point...

14:26.610 --> 14:30.610
I was touching a spot
not four inches from boob.

14:30.690 --> 14:34.890
Not bad, Forman. Not only did you get
within shouting distance of second base...

14:34.970 --> 14:36.810
you successfully
snaked Red's Corvette.

14:36.890 --> 14:39.090
Yeah, well,
I gotta wash it, wax it...

14:39.130 --> 14:41.490
and put on a hubcap, but that
should only take about an hour.

14:41.570 --> 14:43.490
I'm gonna do it
in the morning.

14:49.130 --> 14:51.170
- Perfect. Sleep tight.
- All right.

14:56.010 --> 14:59.250
Oh, by the way, um,
your parents called a couple hours ago.

14:59.330 --> 15:02.650
- They'll be home in 40 minutes.
- What?

15:02.730 --> 15:05.770
Relax, man.
We're just messing with you.

15:06.730 --> 15:08.650
They'll be home
in 20 minutes.

15:30.810 --> 15:34.570
Okay, tire location, check.

15:34.650 --> 15:37.490
Seat placement, check.

15:38.690 --> 15:40.810
Picture of Fez's butt, check.

15:42.010 --> 15:44.530
That one's going
on my desk.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.930
Okay, you guys,
there's just one more thing:

15:47.930 --> 15:50.330
The strand of hair
over the ignition.

15:52.170 --> 15:54.290
Well, you're gonna
get away with it.

15:54.370 --> 15:57.250
What a bunch of crap.

15:57.330 --> 15:59.250
Okay, you guys,
they're here.

16:00.290 --> 16:03.610
Damn it!
The air freshener!

16:03.690 --> 16:06.010
Damn it, you remembered.

16:15.770 --> 16:18.930
Well, there's the Corvette,
safe and sound.

16:19.010 --> 16:23.250
I'm just saying that for your benefit,
in case you can't see it.

16:23.290 --> 16:28.250
Well, I am so glad you raced all the way
home without stopping for this.

16:28.330 --> 16:30.730
Cripes, I gotta pee
like a banshee.

16:33.290 --> 16:36.170
Well, I'm off
to the candy shop.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.930
My Everlasting Gobstopper
just crapped out on me.

16:42.610 --> 16:46.890
Fez, I was sleeping
in Casey's room...

16:46.970 --> 16:50.450
and I think somehow I had
one of his dreams, 'cause I did it with...

16:57.130 --> 16:59.010
Hey, guys.

17:02.810 --> 17:04.690
No, no, Michael.
Finish your sentence.

17:04.770 --> 17:06.810
You did it with...

17:09.089 --> 17:11.010
A hat on?

17:13.410 --> 17:16.369
A-And you.

17:16.450 --> 17:18.490
You, me and a hat.

17:20.170 --> 17:22.089
It was hot.

17:23.770 --> 17:26.369
Of course it was.
Everything's better with a hat.

17:28.850 --> 17:31.650
Come on, fellas.
Put a hat on. The lady deserves it.

17:35.970 --> 17:38.290
What were you doing
in Casey's bed anyway?

17:38.330 --> 17:41.490
Oh, when he's out of town,
I like to skank it up...

17:41.530 --> 17:44.890
by skipping a couple showers
and sleeping in it naked.

17:48.890 --> 17:51.210
Michael, tell me more
about this dream.

17:51.290 --> 17:53.330
Was anyone else there?

17:53.410 --> 17:57.530
Jackie, why would I have a sexy dream
with anyone besides you?

18:06.290 --> 18:08.130
Hey, Donna.

18:14.490 --> 18:17.490
Hey, your old man wants
to talk to you outside.

18:20.770 --> 18:23.930
- Why? Am I busted?
- Don't worry, man. It's not about the car.

18:24.010 --> 18:27.290
- Oh.
- Oh, Forman, I almost forgot.

18:27.370 --> 18:29.250
It's about the car.

18:29.330 --> 18:32.010
You gotta stop
doing that, man!

18:36.650 --> 18:39.410
Um, you wanted
to see me?

18:39.450 --> 18:42.850
Did you take my car out
last night?

18:44.250 --> 18:46.090
No.

18:47.130 --> 18:50.290
I know you didn't.
Guess how I know!

18:51.770 --> 18:54.810
I stuck a hair
across the ignition.

18:55.770 --> 18:58.650
A hair acro...

19:00.930 --> 19:03.250
You know, someday I'm gonna
use that on my son.

19:03.330 --> 19:08.050
Anyway, since I know I can trust you,
I'm gonna let you drive it.

19:09.930 --> 19:13.130
I finally get
to drive it?

19:13.210 --> 19:15.890
Wow!

19:15.930 --> 19:19.970
Okay, uh, where does
the key go?

19:20.050 --> 19:23.090
- Start her up.
- Okay.

19:31.770 --> 19:34.250
And I'm grounded.

19:36.410 --> 19:38.330
For a month!

19:39.450 --> 19:41.330
Why did you do it?

19:41.370 --> 19:46.090
To impress this cheerleader.

19:49.650 --> 19:52.370
No kidding?

19:52.410 --> 19:54.330
Well, then make it
two weeks.

20:00.930 --> 20:02.930
So, uh, you gonna
see her again?

20:03.010 --> 20:07.970
Well, can I have
the car again?

20:09.050 --> 20:12.930
Ohh, she's <i>that</i> girl.

20:13.010 --> 20:16.170
I know that girl.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.610
Stay away
from that girl.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.370
Hey, Forman,
your mom wants to talk to you.

20:22.450 --> 20:25.570
She wants to know why you
drank all of Red's beer.

20:34.050 --> 20:35.970
You know what?

20:36.050 --> 20:37.930
Let's just
call it a month.

20:47.050 --> 20:51.810
- Michael.
- Jackie?

20:53.970 --> 20:57.650
- Am I dreaming?
- Yes, you are.

20:57.730 --> 21:00.170
Are we gonna do it?

21:00.250 --> 21:05.210
- Yes, we are.
- Oh, cool. Where's Donna?

21:05.290 --> 21:08.130
What?

21:09.305 --> 21:15.320
